preface

with
the
publication

bahá
u

and
the
new
era
more
than
ten
years
ago
the
bahá
í
faith
was
given
its
first
thorough
exposition
by
a
student
of
the
teachings
recognizing
its
value
as
the
most
satisfactory
introduction
to
the
cause
bahá
ís
in
both
east
and
west
have
found
esslemont
s
book
so
helpful
that
it
has
been
translated
into
some
thirty
different
languages
as
esslemont
himself
recognized
the
faith
entered
a
new
phase
of
its
history
after
the
ascension
of
abdu
the
result
is
that
the
author
s
views
some
of
them
written
prior
to
no
longer
on
certain
aspects
of
the
subject
correspond
to
the
evolutionary
character
of
the
faith
his
treatment
of
events
and
social
conditions
then
existing
moreover
no
longer
appears
fully
relevant
unavoidably
a
few
errors
of
fact
had
entered
his
text
while
his
explanation
of
the
stations
of
the
báb
and
of
abdu
have
been
replaced
in
the
minds
of
bahá
ís
by
the
authoritative
interpretations
since
made
by
the
first
guardian
of
the
faith
shoghi
effendi
the
present
edition
therefore
represents
a
revision
made
by
the
american
national
spiritual
assembly
acting
under
the
advice
and
approval
of
shoghi
effendi
these
revisions
in
no
respect
alter
the
original
plan
of
esslemont
s
book
nor
affect
the
major
portion
of
his
text
their
purpose
has
been
to
amplify
the
author
s
discussion
in
a
few
passages
by
the
addition
of
material
representing
the
fuller
knowledge
available
since
his
lamented
death
and
newer
translations
of
his
quotations
from
bahá
í
sacred
writings

with
this
edition
the
american
bahá
í
publishing
committee
takes
over
copyright
and
other
interests
in
bahá
u
lláh
and
the
new
era
from
george
allen
unwin
of
london
england
through
whom
the
late
esslemont
published
his
famous
book
more
than
twenty
years
ago
under
arrangement
with
the
british
publishers
the
committee
has
since
brought
out
eleven
printings
in
addition
to
the
first
american
edition
imported
by
brentano
s
of
new
york
this
edition
does
not
displace
the
text
as
it
has
appeared
since
major
revision
was
made
in
the
book
under
the
direction
of
the
guardian
of
the
faith
in
as
the
time
has
not
come
for
anything
like
a
thorough
recasting
of
the
book
to
make
its
references
to
world
conditions
completely
contemporaneous
esslemont
s
work
endures
as
a
trustworthy
introduction
to
the
history
and
teachings
of
the
bahá
í
faith
its
translation
into
some
thirty
different
languages
attests
its
appeal
to
students
in
the
east
as
well
as
the
west
it
should
be
added
that
any
further
revision
of
the
text
in
the
future
is
subject
to
approval
by
shoghi
effendi
the
committee
has
no
authority
to
pass
upon
revisions
which
may
be
desired
by
bahá
ís
of
other
countries
for
their
particular
need
bahá
í
publishing
committee
december
preface
to
edition
since
no
revision
has
been
made
to
the
text
of
esslemont
s
book
although
in
some
minor
corrections
were
introduced
on
the
other
hand
the
diffusion
and
development
of
the
bahá
í
faith
since
that
time
have
been
tremendous
and
there
has
been
added
to
bahá
í
bibliography
a
rich
legacy
of
incomparable
expositions
translations
and
historical
accounts
from
the
pen
of
shoghi
effendi
guardian
of
the
faith
and
the
appointed
interpreter
of
its
sacred
writings
it
has
therefore
been
deemed
necessary
to
bring
the
book
up
to
date
in
order
to
maintain
its
usefulness
for
modern
readers
this
has
been
done
with
a
minimum
of
alteration
to
the
text
and
chiefly
by
the
use
of
footnotes
and
of
an
epilogue
giving
the
current
statistics
and
new
developments
in
the
organic
unfoldment
of
the
bahá
í
faith
esslemont
s
book
continues
to
be
one
of
the
most
widely
used
introductory
books
on
the
bahá
í
faith
as
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
since
the
number
of
its
translations
has
increased
from
thirty
to
bahá
í
publishing
trust
introduction
in
december
through
a
conversation
with
friends
who
had
met
abdu
and
the
loan
of
a
few
pamphlets
i
first
became
acquainted
with
the
bahá
í
teachings
i
was
at
once
struck
by
their
comprehensiveness
power
and
beauty
they
impressed
me
as
meeting
the
great
needs
of
the
modern
world
more
fully
and
satisfactorily
than
any
other
presentation
of
religion
which
i
had
come
impression
which
subsequent
study
has
only
served
to
deepen
and
confirm
in
seeking
for
fuller
knowledge
about
the
movement
i
found
considerable
difficulty
in
obtaining
the
literature
i
wanted
and
soon
conceived
the
idea
of
putting
together
the
gist
of
what
i
learned
in
the
form
of
a
book
so
that
it
might
be
more
easily
available
for
others
when
communication
with
palestine
was
reopened
after
the
war
i
wrote
to
abdu
and
enclosed
a
copy
of
the
first
nine
chapters
of
the
book
which
was
then
almost
complete
in
rough
draft
i
received
a
very
kind
and
encouraging
reply
and
a
cordial
invitation
to
visit
him
in
haifa
and
bring
the
whole
of
my
manuscript
with
me
the
invitation
was
gladly
accepted
and
i
had
the
great
privilege
of
spending
two
and
a
half
months
as
the
guest
of
abdu
during
the
winter
of
during
this
visit
abdu
discussed
the
book
with
me
on
various
occasions
he
gave
several
valuable
suggestions
for
its
improvement
and
proposed
that
when
i
had
revised
the
manuscript
he
would
have
the
whole
of
it
translated
into
persian
so
that
he
could
read
it
through
and
amend
or
correct
it
where
necessary
the
revisal
and
translation
were
carried
out
as
suggested
and
abdu
found
time
amid
his
busy
life
to
correct
some
three
and
a
half
chapters
chapters
i
ii
v
and
part
of
iii
before
he
passed
away
it
is
a
matter
of
profound
regret
to
me
that
abdu
was
not
able
to
complete
the
correction
of
the
manuscript
as
the
value
of
the
book
would
thereby
have
been
greatly
enhanced
the
whole
of
the
manuscript
has
been
carefully
revised
however
by
a
committee
of
the
national
bahá
í
assembly
of
england
and
its
publication
approved
by
that
assembly
i
am
greatly
indebted
to
miss

roy

and

friends
for
valuable
help
in
the
preparation
of
the
work
as
regards
the
transliteration
of
arabic
and
persian
names
and
words
the
system
adopted
in
this
book
is
that
recently
recommended
by
shoghi
effendi
for
use
throughout
the

esslemont

by

chapter
the
glad
tidings
the
promised
one
of
all
the
peoples
of
the
world
hath
appeared
all
peoples
and
communities
have
been
expecting
a
revelation
and
he
bahá
u
lláh
is
the
foremost
teacher
and
educator
of
all
abdu
the
greatest
event
in
history
if
we
study
the
story
of
the
ascent
of
man
as
recorded
in
the
pages
of
history
it
becomes
evident
that
the
leading
factor
in
human
progress
is
the
advent
from
time
to
time
of
men
who
pass
beyond
the
accepted
ideas
of
their
day
and
become
the
discoverers
and
revealers
of
truths
hitherto
unknown
among
mankind
the
inventor
the
pioneer
the
genius
the
are
the
men
on
whom
the
transformation
of
world
primarily
depends
as
carlyle
says
the
plain
truth
very
plain
we
think
is
that
man
that
has
a
higher
wisdom
a
hitherto
unknown
spiritual
truth
in
him
is
stronger
not
than
ten
men
that
have
it
not
or
than
ten
thousand
but
than
men
that
have
it
not
and
stands
among
them
with
a
quite
ethereal
angelic
power
as
with
a
sword
out
of
heaven
s
own
armory
which
no
buckler
and
no
tower
of
brass
will
finally
withstand
of
the
times
in
the
history
of
science
of
art
of
music
we
see
abundant
illustrations
of
this
truth
but
in
no
domain
is
the
supreme
importance
of
the
great
man
and
his
message
more
clearly
evident
than
in
that
of
religion
all
down
the
ages
whenever
the
spiritual
life
of
men
has
become
degenerate
and
their
morals
corrupt
that
most
wonderful
and
mysterious
of
men
the
prophet
makes
his
appearance
alone
against
the
world
without
a
single
human
being
capable
of
teaching
of
guiding
of
fully
understanding
him
or
of
sharing
his
responsibility
he
arises
like
a
seer
among
blind
men
to
proclaim
his
gospel
of
righteousness
and
truth
amongst
the
prophets
some
stand
out
with
special
preeminence
every
few
centuries
a
great
divine
krishna
a
zoroaster
a
moses
a
jesus
a
in
the
east
like
a
spiritual
sun
to
illumine
the
darkened
minds
of
men
and
awaken
their
dormant
souls
whatever
our
views
as
to
the
relative
greatness
of
these
we
must
admit
that
they
have
been
the
most
potent
factors
in
the
education
of
mankind
with
one
accord
these
prophets
declare
that
the
words
they
utter
are
not
from
themselves
but
are
a
revelation
through
them
a
divine
message
of
which
they
are
the
bearers
their
recorded
utterances
abound
too
in
hints
and
promises
of
a
great
world
teacher
who
will
appear
in
the
fullness
of
time
to
carry
on
their
work
and
bring
it
to
fruition
one
who
will
establish
a
reign
of
peace
and
justice
upon
earth
and
bring
into
one
family
all
races
religions
nations
and
tribes
that
there
may
be
one
fold
and
one
shepherd
and
that
all
may
know
and
love
god
from
the
least
even
unto
the
surely
the
advent
of
this
educator
of
mankind
in
the
latter
days
when
he
appears
must
be
the
greatest
event
in
human
history
the
bahá
í
movement
is
proclaiming
to
the
world
the
glad
tidings
that
this
educator
has
in
fact
appeared
that
his
revelation
has
been
delivered
and
recorded
and
may
be
studied
by
every
earnest
seeker
that
the
day
of
the
lord
has
already
dawned
and
the
sun
or
righteousness
as
yet
only
a
few
on
the
mountaintops
have
caught
sight
of
the
glorious
orb
but
already
its
rays
are
illumining
heaven
and
earth
and
erelong
it
will
rise
above
the
mountains
and
shine
with
full
strength
on
the
plains
and
valleys
too
giving
life
and
guidance
to
all
the
changing
world
that
the
world
during
the
nineteenth
and
the
early
part
of
the
twentieth
centuries
has
been
passing
through
the
death
pangs
of
an
old
era
and
the
birth
pangs
of
a
new
is
evident
to
all
the
old
principles
of
materialism
and
the
old
sectarian
and
patriotic
prejudices
and
animosities
are
perishing
discredited
amidst
the
ruins
they
have
wrought
and
in
all
lands
we
see
signs
of
a
new
spirit
of
faith
of
brotherhood
of
internationalism
that
is
bursting
the
old
bonds
and
overrunning
the
old
boundaries
revolutionary
changes
of
unprecedented
magnitude
have
been
occurring
in
every
department
of
human
life
the
old
era
is
not
yet
dead
it
is
engaged
in
a
life
and
death
struggle
with
the
new
evils
there
are
in
plenty
gigantic
and
formidable
but
they
are
being
exposed
investigated
challenged
and
attacked
with
new
vigor
and
hope
clouds
there
are
in
plenty
vast
and
threatening
but
the
light
is
breaking
through
and
is
illumining
the
path
of
progress
and
revealing
the
obstacles
and
pitfalls
that
obstruct
the
onward
way
in
the
eighteenth
century
it
was
different
then
the
spiritual
and
moral
gloom
that
enshrouded
the
world
was
relieved
by
hardly
a
ray
of
light
it
was
like
the
darkest
hour
before
the
dawn
when
the
few
lamps
and
candles
that
remain
alight
do
little
more
than
make
the
darkness
visible
carlyle
in
his
frederick
the
great
writes
of
the
eighteenth
century
thus
a
century
which
has
no
history
and
can
have
little
or
none
a
century
so
opulent
in
accumulated
falsities
as
never
century
before
was
which
had
no
longer
the
consciousness
of
being
false
so
false
had
it
grown
and
was
so
steeped
in
falsity
and
impregnated
with
it
to
the
very
bone
fact
the
measure
of
the
thing
was
full
and
a
french
revolution
had
to
end
it
a
very
fit
termination
as
i
thankfully
feel
for
such
a
century
for
there
was
need
once
more
of
a
divine
revelation
to
the
torpid
frivolous
children
of
men
if
they
were
not
to
sink
altogether
into
the
ape
the
great
book
i
chap
i
compared
with
the
eighteenth
century
the
present
time
is
as
the
dawn
after
darkness
or
as
the
spring
after
winter
the
world
is
stirring
with
new
life
thrilling
with
new
ideals
and
hopes
things
that
but
a
few
years
ago
seemed
impossible
dreams
are
now
accomplished
facts
others
that
seemed
centuries
ahead
of
us
have
already
become
matters
of
practical
we
fly
in
the
air
and
make
voyages
under
the
sea
we
send
messages
around
the
world
with
the
speed
of
lightning
within
a
few
decades
we
have
seen
miracles
too
numerous
to
mention
the
sun
of
righteousness
what
is
the
cause
of
this
sudden
awakening
throughout
the
world
bahá
ís
believe
that
it
is
due
to
a
great
outpouring
of
the
holy
spirit
through
the
prophet
bahá
u
lláh
who
was
born
in
persia
in
and
passed
away
in
the
holy
land
in
bahá
u
lláh
taught
that
the
prophet
or
manifestation
of
god
is
the
of
the
spiritual
world
as
the
sun
is
the
of
the
natural
world
just
as
the
material
sun
shines
over
the
earth
and
causes
the
growth
and
development
of
material
organisms
so
also
through
the
divine
manifestation
the
sun
of
truth
shines
upon
the
world
of
heart
and
soul
and
educates
the
thoughts
morals
and
characters
of
men
and
just
as
the
rays
of
the
natural
sun
have
an
influence
which
penetrates
into
the
darkest
and
shadiest
corners
of
the
world
giving
warmth
and
life
even
to
creatures
that
have
never
seen
the
sun
itself
so
also
the
outpouring
of
the
holy
spirit
through
the
manifestation
of
god
influences
the
lives
of
all
and
inspires
receptive
minds
even
in
places
and
among
peoples
where
the
name
of
the
prophet
is
quite
unknown
the
advent
of
the
manifestation
is
like
the
coming
of
the
spring
it
is
a
day
of
resurrection
in
which
the
spiritually
dead
are
raised
to
new
life
in
which
the
reality
of
the
divine
religions
is
renewed
and
reestablished
in
which
appear
new
heavens
and
a
new
but
in
the
world
of
nature
the
spring
brings
about
not
only
the
growth
and
awakening
of
new
life
but
also
the
destruction
and
removal
of
the
old
and
effete
for
the
same
sun
that
makes
the
flowers
to
spring
and
the
trees
to
bud
causes
also
the
decay
and
disintegration
of
what
is
dead
and
useless
it
loosens
the
ice
and
melts
the
snow
of
winter
and
sets
free
the
flood
and
the
storm
that
cleanse
and
purify
the
earth
so
is
it
also
in
the
spiritual
world
the
spiritual
sunshine
causes
similar
commotion
and
change
thus
the
day
of
resurrection
is
also
the
day
of
judgment
in
which
corruptions
and
imitations
of
the
truth
and
outworn
ideas
and
customs
are
discarded
and
destroyed
in
which
the
ice
and
snow
of
prejudice
and
superstition
which
accumulated
during
the
season
of
winter
are
melted
and
transformed
and
energies
long
frozen
and
pent
up
are
released
to
flood
and
renovate
the
world
the
mission
of
bahá
u
lláh
bahá
u
lláh
declared
plainly
and
repeatedly
that
he
was
the
educator
and
teacher
of
all
peoples
the
channel
of
a
wondrous
grace
that
would
transcend
all
previous
outpourings
in
which
all
previous
forms
of
religion
would
become
merged
as
rivers
merge
in
the
ocean
he
laid
a
foundation
which
affords
a
firm
basis
for
unity
throughout
the
whole
world
and
the
inauguration
of
that
glorious
age
of
peace
on
earth
goodwill
among
men
of
which
prophets
have
told
and
poets
sung
search
after
truth
the
oneness
of
mankind
unity
of
religions
of
races
of
nations
of
east
and
west
the
reconciliation
of
religion
and
science
the
eradication
of
prejudices
and
superstitions
the
equality
of
men
and
women
the
establishment
of
justice
and
righteousness
the
setting
up
of
a
supreme
international
tribunal
the
unification
of
languages
the
compulsory
diffusion
of
and
many
other
teachings
like
these
were
revealed
by
the
pen
of
bahá
u
lláh
during
the
latter
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
innumerable
books
and
epistles
several
of
which
were
addressed
to
the
kings
and
rulers
of
the
world
his
message
unique
in
its
comprehensiveness
and
scope
is
wonderfully
in
accord
with
the
signs
and
needs
of
the
times
never
were
the
new
problems
confronting
men
so
gigantic
and
complex
as
now
never
were
the
proposed
solutions
so
numerous
and
conflicting
never
was
the
need
of
a
great
world
teacher
so
urgent
or
so
widely
felt
never
perhaps
was
the
expectancy
of
such
a
teacher
so
confident
or
so
general
fulfillment
of
prophecies
abdu
writes
when
christ
appeared
twenty
centuries
ago
although
the
jews
were
eagerly
awaiting
his
coming
and
prayed
ever
day
with
tears
saying
o
god
hasten
the
revelation
of
the
messiah
yet
when
the
sun
of
truth
dawned
they
denied
him
and
rose
against
him
with
the
greatest
enmity
and
eventually
crucified
that
divine
spirit
the
word
of
god
and
named
him
beelzebub
the
evil
one
as
is
recorded
in
the
gospel
the
reason
for
this
was
that
they
said
the
revelation
of
christ
according
to
the
clear
text
of
the
torah
will
be
attested
by
certain
signs
and
so
long
as
these
signs
have
not
appeared
whoso
layeth
claim
to
be
a
messiah
is
an
impostor
among
these
signs
is
this
that
the
messiah
should
come
for
an
unknown
place
yet
we
all
know
this
man
s
house
in
nazareth
and
can
any
good
thing
come
out
of
nazareth
the
second
sign
is
that
he
shall
rule
with
a
rod
of
iron
that
is
he
must
act
with
the
sword
but
this
messiah
has
not
even
a
wooden
staff
another
of
the
conditions
and
signs
is
this
he
must
sit
upon
the
throne
of
david
and
establish
david
s
sovereignty
now
far
from
being
enthroned
this
man
has
not
even
a
mat
to
sit
on
another
of
the
conditions
is
this
the
promulgation
of
all
the
laws
of
the
torah
yet
this
man
has
abrogated
these
laws
and
has
even
broken
the
sabbath
day
although
it
is
the
clear
text
of
the
torah
that
whosoever
layeth
claim
to
prophethood
and
revealeth
miracles
and
breaketh
the
sabbath
day
must
be
put
to
death
another
of
the
signs
is
this
that
in
his
reign
justice
will
be
so
advanced
that
righteousness
and
will
extend
from
the
human
even
to
the
animal
snake
and
the
mouse
will
share
one
hold
and
the
eagle
and
the
partridge
one
nest
the
lion
and
the
gazelle
shall
dwell
in
one
pasture
and
the
wolf
and
the
kid
shall
drink
from
one
fountain
yet
now
injustice
and
tyranny
have
waxed
so
great
in
his
time
that
they
have
crucified
him
another
of
the
conditions
is
this
that
in
the
days
of
the
messiah
the
jews
will
prosper
and
triumph
over
all
the
peoples
of
the
world
but
now
they
are
living
in
the
utmost
abasement
and
servitude
in
the
empire
of
the
romans
then
how
can
this
be
the
messiah
promised
in
the
torah
in
this
wise
did
they
object
to
that
sun
of
truth
although
that
spirit
of
god
was
indeed
the
one
promised
in
the
torah
but
as
they
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
these
signs
they
crucified
the
word
of
god
now
the
bahá
ís
hold
that
the
recorded
signs
did
come
to
pass
in
the
manifestation
of
christ
although
not
in
the
sense
which
the
jews
understood
the
description
in
the
torah
being
allegorical
for
instance
among
the
signs
is
that
of
sovereignty
for
bahá
ís
say
that
the
sovereignty
of
christ
was
a
heavenly
divine
everlasting
sovereignty
not
a
napoleonic
sovereignty
that
vanisheth
in
a
short
time
for
two
thousand
years
this
sovereignty
of
christ
hath
been
established
and
until
now
it
endureth
and
to
all
eternity
that
holy
being
will
be
exalted
upon
an
throne
in
like
manner
all
the
other
signs
have
been
made
manifest
but
the
jews
did
not
understand
although
nearly
twenty
centuries
have
elapsed
since
christ
appeared
with
divine
splendor
yet
the
jews
are
still
awaiting
the
coming
of
the
messiah
and
regard
themselves
as
true
and
christ
as
by
abdu
for
this
chapter
had
the
jews
applied
to
christ
he
would
have
explained
to
them
the
true
meaning
of
the
prophecies
concerning
himself
let
us
profit
by
their
example
and
before
deciding
that
the
prophecies
concerning
the
manifestation
of
the
teacher
have
not
been
fulfilled
let
us
turn
to
what
bahá
u
lláh
himself
has
written
regarding
their
interpretation
for
many
of
the
prophecies
are
admittedly
sealed
sayings
and
the
true
educator
himself
is
the
only
one
who
can
break
the
seals
and
show
the
real
meaning
contained
in
the
casket
of
words
bahá
u
lláh
has
written
much
in
explanation
of
the
prophecies
of
old
but
it
is
not
on
these
that
he
depends
for
proof
of
his
prophethood
the
sun
is
its
own
proof
to
all
that
have
the
power
of
perception
when
it
rises
we
need
no
ancient
predictions
to
assure
us
of
its
shining
so
with
the
manifestation
of
god
when
he
appears
were
all
the
former
prophecies
swept
into
oblivion
he
would
still
be
his
own
abundant
and
sufficient
proof
to
all
whose
spiritual
sense
are
open
proofs
of
prophethood
bahá
u
lláh
asked
no
one
to
accept
his
statements
and
his
tokens
blindly
on
the
contrary
he
put
in
the
very
forefront
of
his
teachings
emphatic
warnings
against
blind
acceptance
of
authority
and
urged
all
to
open
their
eyes
and
ears
and
use
their
own
judgement
independently
and
fearlessly
in
order
to
ascertain
the
truth
he
enjoined
the
fullest
investigation
and
never
concealed
himself
offering
as
the
supreme
proofs
of
his
prophethood
his
words
and
works
and
their
effects
in
transforming
the
lives
and
characters
of
men
the
tests
he
proposed
are
the
same
as
those
laid
down
by
his
great
predecessors
moses
said
when
a
prophet
speaketh
in
the
name
of
the
lord
if
the
thing
follow
not
nor
come
to
pass
that
is
the
thing
which
the
lord
hath
not
spoken
but
the
prophet
hath
spoken
it
presumptuously
thou
shalt
not
be
afraid
of
xviii
christ
put
his
test
just
as
plainly
and
appealed
to
it
in
proof
of
his
own
claim
he
said
beware
of
false
prophets
which
come
to
you
in
sheep
s
clothing
but
inwardly
they
are
ravening
wolves
ye
shall
know
them
by
their
fruits
do
men
gather
grapes
of
thorns
or
figs
of
thistles
even
so
every
good
tree
bringeth
forth
good
fruit
but
a
corrupt
tree
bringeth
forth
evil
fruit
wherefore
by
their
fruits
ye
shall
know
vii
in
the
chapters
that
follow
we
shall
endeavor
to
show
whether
bahá
u
lláh
s
claim
to
prophethood
stands
or
falls
by
application
of
these
tests
whether
the
things
that
he
had
spoken
have
followed
and
come
to
pass
and
whether
his
fruits
have
been
good
or
evil
in
other
words
whether
his
prophecies
are
being
fulfilled
and
his
ordinances
established
and
whether
his
lifework
has
contributed
to
the
education
and
upliftment
of
humanity
and
the
betterment
of
morals
or
the
contrary
difficulties
of
investigation
there
are
of
course
difficulties
in
the
way
of
the
student
who
seeks
to
get
at
the
truth
about
this
cause
like
all
great
moral
and
spiritual
reformations
the
bahá
í
faith
has
been
grossly
misrepresented
about
the
terrible
persecutions
and
sufferings
of
bahá
u
lláh
and
his
followers
both
friends
and
enemies
are
in
entire
agreement
about
the
value
of
the
movement
however
and
the
character
of
its
founders
the
statements
of
the
believers
and
the
accounts
of
the
deniers
are
utterly
at
variance
it
is
just
as
in
the
time
of
christ
concerning
the
crucifixion
of
jesus
and
the
persecution
and
martyrdom
of
his
followers
both
christian
and
jewish
historians
are
in
agreement
but
whereas
the
believers
say
that
christ
fulfilled
and
developed
the
teachings
of
moses
and
the
prophets
the
deniers
declare
that
he
broke
the
laws
and
ordinances
and
was
worthy
of
death
in
religion
as
in
science
truth
reveals
her
mysteries
only
to
the
humble
and
reverent
seeker
who
is
ready
to
lay
aside
every
prejudice
and
sell
all
that
he
has
in
order
that
he
may
buy
the
one
pearl
of
great
to
understand
the
bahá
í
faith
in
its
full
significance
we
must
undertake
its
study
in
the
spirit
of
sincere
and
selfless
devotion
to
truth
persevering
in
the
path
of
search
and
relying
on
divine
guidance
in
the
writings
of
its
founders
we
shall
find
the
master
key
to
the
mysteries
of
this
great
spiritual
awakening
and
the
ultimate
criterion
of
its
value
unfortunately
here
again
there
are
difficulties
in
the
way
of
the
student
who
is
unacquainted
with
the
persian
and
arabic
languages
in
which
the
teachings
are
written
only
a
small
proportion
of
the
writings
has
been
translated
into
english
and
many
of
the
translations
which
have
appeared
leave
much
to
be
desired
both
in
accuracy
and
style
but
despite
the
imperfection
and
inadequacy
of
historical
narratives
and
translations
the
greatest
essential
truths
which
form
the
massive
and
firm
foundations
of
this
cause
stand
out
like
mountains
from
the
mists
of
uncertainty
aim
of
book
the
endeavor
in
the
following
chapters
will
be
to
set
forth
as
far
as
possible
fairly
and
without
prejudice
the
salient
features
of
the
history
and
more
especially
of
the
teachings
of
the
bahá
í
cause
so
that
readers
may
be
enabled
to
form
an
intelligent
judgment
as
to
their
importance
and
perhaps
be
induced
to
search
into
the
subject
more
deeply
for
themselves
search
after
truth
however
important
though
it
be
is
not
the
whole
aim
and
end
of
life
the
truth
is
no
dead
thing
to
be
placed
in
a
museum
when
be
labeled
classified
catalogued
exhibited
and
left
there
dry
and
sterile
it
is
something
vital
which
must
take
root
in
men
s
hearts
and
bear
fruit
in
their
lives
ere
they
reap
the
full
reward
of
their
search
the
real
object
therefore
in
spreading
the
knowledge
of
a
prophetic
revelation
is
that
those
who
become
convinced
of
its
truth
may
proceed
to
practice
its
principles
to
lead
the
life
and
diffuse
the
glad
tidings
thus
hastening
the
advent
of
that
blessed
day
when
god
s
will
shall
be
done
on
earth
as
it
is
in
heaven
chapter
the
báb
the
forerunner
verily
the
oppressor
hath
slain
the
beloved
of
the
worlds
that
he
might
thereby
quench
the
light
of
god
amidst
his
creatures
and
withhold
mankind
from
the
stream

the

has
occupied
a
unique
place
in
the
history
of
the
world
in
the
days
of
her
early
greatness
she
was
a
veritable
queen
among
nations
unrivaled
in
civilization
in
power
and
in
splendor
she
gave
to
the

world
famous

she
has
left
traces
of
her
former
greatness
yet
in
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
she
had
sunk
to
a
condition
of
deplorable
degradation
her
ancient
glory
seemed
irretrievably
lost
her
government
was
corrupt
and
in
desperate
financial
straits
some
of
her
rulers
were
feeble
and
other
monsters
of
cruelty
her
priests
were
bigoted
and
intolerant
her
people
ignorant
and
superstitious
most
of
them
belonged
to
the
ih
sect
of
muḥammadans
but
there
were
also
considerable
numbers
of
zoroastrians
jews
and
christians
of
diverse
and
antagonistic
sects
all
professed
to
follow
sublime
teachers
who
exhorted
them
to
worship
the
one
god
and
to
live
in
love
and
unity
yet
they
shunned
detested
and
despised
each
other
each
sect
regarding
the
others
as
unclean
as
dogs
or
heathens
cursing
and
execration
were
indulged
in
to
a
fearful
extent
it
was
dangerous
for
a
jew
or
a
zoroastrian
to
walk
in
the
street
on
a
rainy
day
for
if
his
wet
garment
should
touch
a
muḥammadan
the
muslim
was
defiled
and
the
other
might
have
to
atone
for
the
offense
with
his
life
if
a
muḥammadan
took
money
from
a
jew
zoroastrian
or
christian
he
had
to
wash
it
before
he
could
put
it
in
his
pocket
if
a
jew
found
his
child
giving
a
glass
of
water
to
a
poor
muḥammadan
beggar
he
would
dash
the
glass
from
the
child
s
hand
for
curses
rather
than
kindness
should
be
the
portion
of
infidels
the
muslims
themselves
were
divided
into
numerous
sects
among
whom
strife
was
often
bitter
and
fierce
the
zoroastrians
did
not
join
much
in
these
mutual
recriminations
but
lived
in
communities
apart
refusing
to
associate
with
their
fellow
countrymen
of
other
faiths
social
as
well
as
religious
affairs
were
in
a
state
of
hopeless
decadence
education
was
neglected
western
science
and
art
were
looked
upon
as
unclean
and
contrary
to
religion
justice
was
travestied
pillage
and
robbery
were
of
common
occurrence
roads
were
bad
and
unsafe
for
travel
sanitary
arrangements
were
shockingly
defective
yet
notwithstanding
all
this
the
light
of
spiritual
life
was
not
extinct
in
persia
here
and
there
amid
the
prevailing
worldliness
and
superstition
could
still
be
found
some
saintly
souls
and
in
many
a
heart
the
longing
for
god
was
cherished
as
in
the
hearts
of
anna
and
simeon
before
the
appearance
of
jesus
many
were
eagerly
awaiting
the
coming
of
a
promised
messenger
of
god
and
confident
that
the
time
of
his
advent
was
at
hand
such
was
the
state
of
affairs
in
persia
when
the
báb
the
herald
of
a
new
era
set
all
the
country
in
commotion

was
a
siyyid

a
descendant
of
the
prophet
muḥammad

father
a
merchant

soon
after

at
the
age
of
fifteen
he
went
into
business
at
first
with
his
guardian
and
afterward
with
another
uncle
who
lived
at
on
the
shore
of
the
gulf
of
persia
as
a
youth
he
was
noted
for
great
personal
beauty
and
charm
of
manner
and
also
for
exceptional
piety
and
nobility
of
character
he
was
unfailing
in
his
observance
of
the
prayers

and
other
ordinances
of
the
muḥammadan
religion
and
not

obeyed
the

spirit
of
the
prophet

teachings

married
when
about
years
of
age
of
this
marriage
one
son
was
born

died
while
still
an
infant
in
the
first
year
of
the
báb
s
public
ministry
declaration
on
reaching
his
year
in
response
to
divine
command
he
declared
that
god
the
exalted
had
elected
him
to
the
station
of
in
a
traveller
s
narrative
we
read
that
what
he
intended
by
the
term
báb
was
this
that
he
was
the
channel
of
grace
from
some
great
person
still
behind
the
veil
of
glory
who
was
the
possessor
of
countless
and
boundless
perfections
by
whose
will
he
moved
and

of
whose
love
he
traveller
s
narrative
episode
of
the
báb
in
those
days
belief
in
the
imminent
appearance
of
a
divine
messenger
was
especially
prevalent
among
a
sect
known
as
the
and
it
was
to
a
distinguished
divine
belonging
to
this
sect
called
mullá
ḥusayn
i
that
the
báb
first
announced
his
mission
the
exact
date
of
this
announcement
is
given
in
the
bayán
one
of
the
báb
s
writings
as
two
hours
and
eleven
minutes
after
sunset
on
the
eve
preceding
the
fifth
day
of
the
month
of
jamádiyu
abdu
was
born
in
the
course
of
the
same
night
but
the
exact
hour
of
his
birth
has
not
been
ascertained
after
some
days
of
anxious
investigation
and
study
mullá
ḥusayn
became
firmly
convinced
that
the
messenger
long
expected
by
the
ihs
had
indeed
appeared
his
eager
enthusiasm
over
this
discovery
was
soon
shared
by
several
of
his
friends
before
long
the
majority
of
the
accepted
the
báb
becoming
known
as
bábís
and
soon
the
fame
of
the
young
prophet
began
to
spread
like
wildfire
throughout
the
land
spread
of
the
bábí
movement
the
first
eighteen
disciples
of
the
báb
with
himself
as
nineteenth
became
known
as
letters
of
the
these
disciples
he
sent
to
different
parts
of
persian
and
turkistán
to
spread
the
news
of
his
advent
meantime
he
himself
set
out
on
a
pilgrimage
to
mecca
where
he
arrived
in
december
and
there
openly
declared
his
mission
on
his
return
to
great
excitement
was
caused
by
the
announcement
of
his
bábhood
the
fire
of
his
eloquence
the
wonder
of
his
rapid
and
inspired
writings
his
extraordinary
wisdom
and
knowledge
his
courage
and
zeal
as
a
reformer
aroused
the
greatest
enthusiasm
among
his
followers
but
excited
a
corresponding
degree
of
alarm
and
enmity
among
the
orthodox
muslims
the
ih
doctors
vehemently
denounced
him
and
persuaded
the
governor
of
fárs
namely
ḥusayn
a
fanatical
and
tyrannical
ruler
to
undertake
the
suppression
of
the
new
heresy
then
commenced
for
the
báb
a
long
series
of
imprisonments
deportations
examinations
before
tribunals
scourgings
and
indignities
which
ended
only
with
his
martyrdom
in
claims
of
the
báb
the
hostility
aroused
by
the
claim
of
bábhood
was
redoubled
when
the
young
reformer
proceeded
to
declare
that
he
was
himself
the
mihdí
mahdi
whose
coming
muḥammad
had
foretold
the
ihs
identified
this
mihdí
with
the
imám
who
according
to
their
beliefs
had
mysteriously
disappeared
from
the
sight
of
men
about
a
thousand
years
previously
they
believed
that
he
was
still
alive
and
would
reappear
in
the
same
body
as
before
and
they
interpreted
in
a
material
sense
the
prophecies
regarding
his
dominion
his
glory
his
conquests
and
the
signs
of
his
advent
just
as
the
jews
in
the
time
of
christ
interpreted
similar
prophecies
regarding
the
messiah
they
expected
that
he
would
appear
with
earthly
sovereignty
and
an
innumerable
army
and
declare
his
revelation
that
he
would
raise
dead
bodies
and
restore
them
to
life
and
so
on
as
these
signs
did
not
appear
the
ihs
rejected
the
báb
with
the
same
fierce
scorn
which
the
jews
displayed
towards
jesus
the
bábís
on
the
other
hand
interpreted
many
of
the
prophecies
figuratively
they
regarded
the
sovereignty
of
the
promised
one
like
that
of
the
galilean
man
of
sorrows
as
a
mystical
sovereignty
his
glory
as
spiritual
not
earthly
glory
his
conquests
as
conquests
over
the
cities
of
men
s
hearts
and
they
found
abundant
proof
of
the
báb
s
claim
in
his
wonderful
life
and
teachings
his
unshakable
faith
his
invincible
steadfastness
and
his
power
of
raising
to
newness
of
spiritual
life
those
who
were
in
the
graves
of
error
and
ignorance
but
the
báb
did
not
stop
even
with
the
claim
of
mihdíhood
he
adopted
the
sacred
title
of
nuqṭiyiúlá
or
primal
this
was
a
title
applied
to
muḥammad
himself
by
his
followers
even
the
imáms
were
secondary
in
importance
to
the
point
from
whom
they
derived
their
inspiration
and
authority
in
assuming
this
title
the
báb
claimed
to
rank
like
muḥammad
in
the
series
of
great
founders
of
religion
and
for
this
reason
in
the
eyes
of
the
ihs
he
was
regarded
as
an
impostor
just
as
moses
and
jesus
before
him
had
been
regarded
as
impostors
he
even
inaugurated
a
new
calendar
restoring
the
solar
year
and
dating
the
commencement
of
the
new
era
from
the
year
of
his
own
declaration
persecution
increases
in
consequence
of
these
declarations
of
the
báb
and
the
alarming
rapidity
with
which
people
of
all
classes
rich
and
poor
learned
and
ignorant
were
eagerly
responding
to
his
teaching
attempts
at
suppression
became
more
and
more
ruthless
and
determined
houses
were
pillaged
and
destroyed
women
were
seized
and
carried
off
in
ṭihrán
fárs
mázindarán
and
other
places
great
numbers
of
the
believers
were
put
to
death
many
were
beheaded
hanged
blown
from
the
mouths
of
cannon
burnt
or
chopped
to
pieces
despite
all
attempts
at
repression
however
the
movement
progressed
nay
through
this
very
oppression
the
assurance
of
the
believers
increased
for
thereby
many
of
the
prophecies
concerning
the
coming
of
the
mihdí
were
literally
fulfilled
thus
in
a
tradition
recorded
by
jabír
which
the
ihs
regard
as
authentic
we
read
in
him
shall
be
the
perfection
of
moses
the
preciousness
of
jesus
and
the
patience
of
job
his
saints
shall
be
abased
in
his
time
and
their
heads
shall
be
exchanged
as
presents
even
as
the
heads
of
the
turk
and
the
deylamite
are
exchanged
as
presents
they
shall
be
slain
and
burned
and
shall
be
afraid
fearful
and
dismayed
the
earth
shall
be
dyed
with
their
blood
and
lamentation
shall
prevail
amongst
their
women
these
are
my
saints
history
of
the
báb
translated
by
browne
martyrdom
of
the
báb
on
the
of
july
the
báb
himself
who
was
then
in
his
year
fell
a
victim
to
the
fanatical
fury
of
his
persecutors
with
a
devoted
young
follower
name
áqá
muḥammad
alí
who
had
passionately
begged
to
be
allowed
to
share
his
martyrdom
he
was
led
to
the
scaffold
in
the
old
barrack
square
of
tabríz
about
two
hours
before
noon
the
two
were
suspended
by
ropes
under
their
armpits
in
such
a
way
that
the
head
of
muḥammad
alí
rested
against
the
breast
of
his
beloved
master
a
regiment
of
armenian
soldiers
was
drawn
up
and
received
the
order
to
fire
promptly
the
volleys
rang
out
but
when
the
smoke
cleared
it
was
found
that
the
báb
and
his
companion
were
still
alive
the
bullets
had
but
severed
the
ropes
by
which
they
were
suspended
so
that
they
dropped
to
the
ground
unhurt
the
báb
proceeded
to
a
room
nearby
where
he
was
found
talking
to
one
of
his
friends
about
noon
they
were
again
suspended
the
armenians
who
considered
the
result
of
their
volleys
a
miracle
were
unwilling
to
fire
again
so
another
regiment
of
soldiers
had
been
brought
on
the
scene
who
fired
when
ordered
this
time
the
volleys
took
effect
the
bodies
of
both
victims
were
riddled
by
bullets
and
horribly
mutilated
although
their
faces
were
almost
untouched
by
this
foul
deed
the
barrack
square
of
tabríz
became
a
second
calvary
the
enemies
of
the
báb
enjoyed
a
guilty
thrill
of
triumph
thinking
that
this
hated
tree
of
the
bábí
faith
was
now
severed
at
the
root
and
its
complete
eradication
would
be
easy
but
their
triumph
was
they
did
not
realize
that
the
tree
of
truth
can
not
be
felled
by
any
material
ax
had
they
but
known
this
very
crime
of
theirs
was
the
means
of
giving
greater
vigor
to
the
cause
the
martyrdom
of
the
báb
fulfilled
his
own
cherished
wish
and
inspired
his
followers
with
increased
zeal
such
was
the
fire
of
their
spiritual
enthusiasm
that
the
bitter
winds
of
persecution
but
fanned
it
to
a
fiercer
blaze
the
greater
the
efforts
at
extinction
the
higher
mounted
the
flames
tomb
on
mount
carmel
after
the
báb
s
martyrdom
his
remains
with
those
of
his
devoted
companion
were
thrown
on
the
edge
of
the
moat
outside
the
city
wall
on
the
second
night
they
were
rescued
at
midnight
by
some
of
the
bábís
and
after
being
concealed
for
years
in
secret
depositories
in
persia
were
ultimately
brought
with
great
danger
and
difficulty
to
the
holy
land
there
they
are
now
interred
in
a
tomb
beautifully
situated
on
the
slope
of
mount
carmel
not
far
from
the
cave
of
elijah
and
only
a
few
miles
from
the
spot
where
bahá
u
lláh
spent
his
last
years
and
where
his
remains
now
lie
among
the
thousands
of
pilgrims
from
all
parts
of
the
world
who
come
to
pay
homage
at
the
holy
tomb
of
bahá
u
lláh
none
omit
to
offer
a
prayer
also
at
the
shrine
of
his
devoted
lover
and
forerunner
the
báb
writings
of
báb
the
writings
of
the
báb
were
voluminous
and
the
rapidity
with
which
without
study
or
premeditation
he
composed
elaborate
commentaries
profound
expositions
or
eloquent
prayers
was
regarded
as
one
of
the
proofs
of
his
divine
inspiration
the
purport
of
his
various
writings
has
been
summarized
as
follows
some
of
these
the
báb
s
writings
were
commentaries
on
and
interpretations
of
the
verses
of
the
kur
an
some
were
prayers
homilies
and
hints
of
the
true
significance
of
certain
passages
other
were
exhortations
admonitions
dissertations
on
the
different
branches
of
the
doctrine
of
the
divine
unity
encouragements
to
amendment
of
character
severance
from
worldly
states
and
dependence
on
the
inspirations
of
god
but
the
essence
and
purport
of
his
compositions
were
the
praises
and
descriptions
of
that
reality
soon
to
appear
which
was
his
only
object
and
aim
his
darling
and
his
desire
for
he
regarded
his
own
appearance
as
that
of
a
harbinger
of
good
tidings
and
considered
his
own
real
nature
merely
as
a
means
for
the
manifestation
of
the
greater
perfections
of
that
one
and
indeed
he
ceased
not
from
celebrating
him
by
night
or
day
for
a
single
instant
but
used
to
signify
to
all
his
followers
that
they
should
expect
his
arising
in
such
wise
that
he
declares
in
his
writings
i
am
a
letter
out
of
that
most
might
book
and
a
from
that
limitless
ocean
and
when
he
shall
appear
my
true
nature
my
mysteries
riddles
and
intimations
will
become
evident
and
the
embryo
of
this
religion
shall
develop
through
the
grades
of
its
being
and
ascent
attain
to
the
station
of
the
most
comely
of
forms
and
become
adorned
with
the
robe
of
blessed
be
god
the
best
of
and
so
inflamed
was
he
with
his
flame
that
commemoration
of
him
was
the
bright
candle
of
his
dark
nights
in
the
fortress
of
mákú
and
remembrance
of
him
was
the
best
of
companions
in
the
straits
of
the
prison
of
thereby
he
obtained
spiritual
enlargements
with
his
wine
was
he
inebriated
and
at
remembrance
of
him
did
he
traveller
s
narrative
episode
of
the
báb
pp
he
whom
god
shall
make
manifest
the
báb
has
been
compared
to
john
the
baptist
but
the
station
of
the
báb
is
not
merely
that
of
the
herald
or
forerunner
in
himself
the
báb
was
a
manifestation
of
god
the
founder
of
an
independent
religion
even
though
that
religion
was
limited
in
time
to
a
brief
period
of
years
the
bahá
ís
believe
that
the
báb
and
bahá
u
lláh
were
of
their
faith
the
following
words
of
bahá
u
lláh
testifying
to
this
truth
that
so
brief
a
span
should
have
separated
this
most
mighty
and
wondrous
revelation
from
mine
own
previous
manifestation
is
a
secret
that
no
man
can
unravel
and
a
mystery
such
as
no
mind
can
fathom
its
duration
had
been
foreordained
and
no
man
shall
ever
discover
its
reason
unless
and
until
he
be
informed
of
the
contents
of
my
hidden
in
his
references
to
bahá
u
lláh
however
the
báb
revealed
an
utter
selflessness
declaring
that
in
the
day
of
him
whom
god
shall
manifest
if
one
should
hear
a
single
verse
from
him
and
recite
it
it
is
better
that
he
should
recite
the
beyán
the
revelation
of
the
báb
a
thousand
traveller
s
narrative
episode
of
the
báb
he
counted
himself
happy
in
enduring
any
affliction
if
by
so
doing
he
could
smooth
the
path
be
ever
so
little
for
him
whom
god
shall
make
manifest
who
was
he
declared
the
sole
source
of
his
inspiration
as
well
as
the
sole
object
of
his
love
resurrection
paradise
and
hell
an
important
part
of
the
báb
s
teaching
is
his
explanation
of
the
terms
resurrection
day
of
judgment
paradise
and
hell
by
the
resurrection
is
meant
he
said
the
appearance
of
a
new
manifestation
of
the
sun
of
truth
the
raising
of
the
dead
means
the
spiritual
awakening
of
those
who
are
asleep
in
the
graves
of
ignorance
heedlessness
and
lust
the
day
of
judgment
is
the
day
of
the
new
manifestation
by
acceptance
or
rejection
of
whose
revelation
the
sheep
are
separated
from
the
goats
for
the
sheep
know
the
voice
of
the
good
shepherd
and
follow
him
paradise
is
the
joy
of
knowing
and
loving
god
as
revealed
through
his
manifestation
thereby
attaining
to
the
utmost
perfection
of
which
one
is
capable
and
after
death
obtaining
entrance
to
the
kingdom
of
god
and
the
life
everlasting
hell
is
simply
deprivation
of
that
knowledge
of
god
with
consequent
failure
to
attain
divine
perfection
and
loss
of
the
eternal
favor
he
definitely
declared
that
these
terms
have
no
real
meaning
apart
from
this
and
that
the
prevalent
ideas
regarding
the
resurrection
of
the
material
body
a
material
heaven
and
hell
and
the
like
are
mere
figments
of
the
imagination
he
taught
that
man
has
a
life
after
death
and
that
in
the
afterlife
progress
towards
perfection
is
limitless
social
and
ethical
teachings
in
his
writings
the
báb
tells
his
followers
that
they
must
be
distinguished
by
brotherly
love
and
courtesy
useful
arts
and
crafts
must
be
cultivated
elementary
education
should
be
general
in
the
new
and
wondrous
dispensation
now
commencing
women
are
to
have
fuller
freedom
the
poor
are
to
be
provided
for
out
of
the
common
treasury
but
begging
is
strictly
forbidden
as
is
the
use
of
intoxicating
liquors
for
beverage
purposes
the
guiding
motive
of
the
true
bábí
must
be
pure
love
without
hope
of
reward
or
fear
of
punishment
thus
he
says
in
the
bayán
so
worship
god
that
if
the
recompense
of
thy
worship
of
him
were
to
be
the
fire
no
alteration
in
thy
worship
of
him
would
be
produced
if
you
worship
from
fear
that
is
unworthy
of
the
threshold
of
the
holiness
of
god
so
also
if
your
gaze
is
on
paradise
and
if
you
worship
in
hope
of
that
for
then
you
have
made
god
s
creation
a
partner
with

passion
and
triumph
this
last
quotation
reveals
the
spirit
which
animated
the
báb
s
whole
life
to
know
and
love
god
to
mirror
forth
his
attributes
and
to
prepare
the
way
for
his
coming
were
the
sole
aim
and
object
of
his
being
for
him
life
had
no
terrors
and
death
no
sting
for
love
had
cast
out
fear
and
martyrdom
itself
was
but
the
rapture
of
casting
his
all
at
the
feet
of
his
beloved
strange
that
this
pure
and
beautiful
soul
this
inspired
teacher
of
divine
truth
this
devoted
lover
of
god
and
of
his
fellowmen
should
be
so
hated
and
done
to
death
by
the
professedly
religious
of
his
day
surely
nothing
but
unthinking
or
willful
prejudice
could
blind
men
to
the
fact
that
here
was
indeed
a
prophet
a
holy
messenger
of
god
worldly
greatness
and
glory
he
had
none
but
how
can
spiritual
power
and
dominion
be
proved
except
by
the
ability
to
dispense
with
all
earthly
assistance
and
to
triumph
over
all
earthly
opposition
even
the
most
potent
and
virulent
how
can
divine
love
be
demonstrated
to
an
unbelieving
world
save
by
its
capacity
to
endure
to
the
uttermost
the
blows
of
calamity
and
darts
of
affliction
the
hated
of
enemies
and
the
treachery
of
seeming
friends
to
rise
serene
above
all
these
and
undismayed
and
unembittered
still
to
forgive
and
bless
the
báb
has
endured
and
the
báb
has
triumphed
thousands
have
testified
to
the
sincerity
of
their
love
for
him
by
sacrificing
their
lives
and
their
all
in
his
service
kings
might
well
envy
his
power
over
men
s
hearts
and
lives
moreover
he
whom
the
lord
shall
make
manifest
has
appeared
has
confirmed
the
claims
and
accepted
the
devotion
of
his
forerunner
and
made
him
partaker
of

mírzá
ḥusayn
alí
who
afterwards
assumed
the
title
of
bahá
u
lláh
glory
of
god
was
the
eldest
son
of
mírzá
abbás
of
núr
a
vazír
or
minister
of
state
his
family
was
wealthy
and
distinguished
many
of
its
members
having
occupied
important
positions
in
the
government
and
in
the
civil
and
military
services
of
persia
he
was
born
in
ṭihrán
teheran
the
capital
city
of
persia
between
dawn
and
sunrise
on
the
of
november
he
never
attended
school
or
college
and
what
little
teaching
he
received
was
given
at
home
nevertheless
even
as
a
child
he
showed
wonderful
wisdom
and
knowledge
while
he
was
still
a
youth
his
father
died
leaving
him
responsible
for
the
care
of
his
younger
brothers
and
sisters
and
for
the
management
of
the
extensive
family
estates
on
one
occasion
abdu
the
eldest
son
of
bahá
u
lláh
related
to
the
writer
the
following
particulars
about
his
father
s
early
days
from
childhood
he
was
extremely
kind
and
generous
he
was
a
great
lover
of
outdoor
life
most
of
his
time
being
spent
in
the
garden
or
the
fields
he
had
an
extraordinary
power
of
attraction
which
was
felt
by
all
people
always
crowded
around
him
ministers
and
people
of
the
court
would
surround
him
and
the
children
also
were
devoted
to
him
when
he
was
only
thirteen
of
fourteen
years
old
he
became
renowned
for
his
learning
he
would
converse
on
any
subject
and
solve
any
problem
presented
to
him
in
large
gatherings
he
would
discuss
matters
with
the
ulamá
leading
mullás
and
would
explain
intricate
religious
questions
all
of
them
used
to
listen
to
him
with
the
greatest
interest
when
bahá
u
lláh
was
years
old
his
father
died
and
the
government
wished
him
to
succeed
to
his
father
s
position
in
the
ministry
as
was
customary
in
persia
but
bahá
u
lláh
did
not
accept
the
offer
then
the
prime
minister
said
leave
him
to
himself
such
a
position
is
unworthy
of
him
he
has
some
higher
aim
in
view
i
can
not
understand
him
but
i
am
convinced
that
he
is
destined
for
some
lofty
career
his
thought
are
not
like
ours
let
him
imprisoned
as
bábí
when
the
báb
declared
his
mission
in
bahá
u
lláh
who
was
then
in
his
year
boldly
espoused
the
cause
of
the
new
faith
of
which
he
soon
became
recognized
as
one
of
the
most
powerful
and
fearless
exponents
he
had
already
twice
suffered
imprisonment
for
the
cause
and
on
one
occasion
had
undergone
the
torture
of
the
bastinado
when
in
august
an
event
occurred
fraught
with
terrible
consequences
for
the
bábís
one
of
the
báb
s
followers
a
youth
named
ṣádiq
had
been
so
affected
by
the
martyrdom
of
his
beloved
master
of
which
he
was
an
eyewitness
that
his
mind
became
deranged
and
in
revenge
he
waylaid
the
and
fired
a
pistol
at
him
instead
of
using
a
bullet
however
he
charged
his
weapon
with
small
shot
and
although
a
few
pellets
struck
the
no
serious
harm
was
done
the
youth
dragged
the
from
his
horse
but
was
promptly
seized
by
the
attendants
of
his
majesty
and
put
to
death
on
the
spot
the
whole
body
of
bábís
was
unjustly
held
responsible
for
the
deed
and
frightful
massacres
ensued
eighty
of
them
were
forthwith
put
to
death
in
ṭihrán
with
the
most
revolting
tortures
many
others
were
seized
and
put
into
prisons
among
them
being
bahá
u
lláh
he
afterwards
wrote
by
the
righteousness
of
god
we
were
in
no
wise
connected
with
that
evil
deed
and
our
innocence
was
indisputably
established
by
the
tribunals
nevertheless
they
apprehended
us
and
from
níyávarán
which
was
then
the
residence
of
his
majesty
conducted
us
on
foot
and
in
chains
with
bared
head
and
bare
feet
to
the
dungeon
of
ṭihrán
a
brutal
man
accompanying
us
on
horseback
snatched
off
our
hat
whilst
we
were
being
hurried
along
by
a
troop
of
executioners
and
officials
we
were
consigned
for
four
months
to
a
place
foul
beyond
comparison
as
to
the
dungeon
in
which
this
wronged
one
and
other
similarly
wronged
were
confined
a
dark
and
narrow
pit
were
preferable
upon
our
arrival
we
were
first
conducted
along
a
corridor
from
whence
we
descended
three
steep
flights
of
stairs
to
the
place
of
confinement
assigned
to
us
the
dungeon
was
wrapped
in
thick
darkness
and
our
numbered
nearly
a
hundred
and
fifty
souls
thieves
assassins
and
highwaymen
though
crowded
it
had
no
other
outlet
than
the
passage
by
which
we
entered
no
pen
can
depict
that
place
nor
any
tongue
describe
its
loathsome
smell
most
of
these
men
had
neither
clothes
nor
bedding
to
lie
on
god
alone
knoweth
what
befell
us
in
that
most
and
gloomy
place
day
and
night
while
confined
in
that
dungeon
we
meditated
upon
the
deeds
the
condition
and
the
conduct
of
the
bábís
wondering
what
could
have
led
a
people
so
so
noble
and
of
such
intelligence
to
perpetrate
such
an
audacious
and
outrageous
act
against
the
person
of
his
majesty
this
wronged
one
thereupon
decided
to
arise
after
his
release
from
prison
and
undertake
with
the
utmost
vigor
the
task
of
regenerating
this
people
on
night
in
a
dream
these
exalted
words
were
heard
on
every
side
verily
we
shall
render
thee
victorious
by
thyself
and
by
thy
pen
grieve
thou
not
for
that
which
hath
befallen
thee
neither
be
thou
afraid
for
thou
art
in
safety
erelong
will
god
raise
up
the
treasures
of
the
who
will
aid
thee
through
thyself
and
through
thy
name
wherewith
god
hath
revived
the
hearts
of
such
as
have
recognized
to
the
son
of
the
wolf
pp
exile
to
baghdád
this
terrible
imprisonment
lasted
four
months
but
bahá
u
lláh
and
his
companions
remained
zealous
and
enthusiastic
in
the
greatest
of
happiness
almost
every
day
one
or
more
of
them
was
tortured
or
put
to
death
and
the
others
reminded
that
their
turn
might
come
next
when
the
executioners
came
to
fetch
one
of
the
friends
the
one
whose
name
was
called
would
literally
dance
with
joy
kiss
the
hands
of
bahá
u
lláh
embrace
the
rest
of
his
fellow
believers
and
then
hasten
with
glad
eagerness
to
the
place
of
martyrdom
it
was
conclusively
proved
that
bahá
u
lláh
had
no
share
in
the
plot
against
the
and
the
russian
minister
testified
to
the
purity
of
his
character
he
was
moreover
so
ill
that
it
was
thought
he
would
die
instead
therefore
of
sentencing
him
to
death
the
ordered
that
he
should
be
exiled
to
arab
in
mesopotamia
and
thither
a
fortnight
later
bahá
u
lláh
set
out
accompanied
by
his
family
and
a
number
of
other
believers
they
suffered
terribly
from
cold
and
other
hardships
on
the
long
winter
journey
and
arrived
in
in
a
state
of
almost
utter
destitution
as
soon
as
his
health
permitted
bahá
u
lláh
began
to
teach
inquirers
and
to
encourage
and
exhort
the
believers
and
soon
peace
and
happiness
reigned
among
the
bábís
this
however
was
bahá
u
lláh
s
half
brother
mírzá
yaḥyá
also
known
as
arrived
in
and
soon
afterwards
differences
secretly
instigated
by
him
began
to
grow
just
as
similar
divisions
had
arisen
among
the
disciples
of
christ
these
differences
which
later
in
adrianople
became
open
and
violent
were
very
painful
to
bahá
u
lláh
whose
whole
aim
in
life
was
the
promotion
of
unity
among
the
people
of
the
world
two
years
in
the
wilderness
about
a
year
after
coming
to
he
departed
alone
into
the
wilderness
of
sulaymáníyyih
taking
with
him
nothing
but
a
change
of
clothes
regarding
this
period
he
write
in
the
book
of
íqán
as
follows
in
the
early
days
of
our
arrival
in
this
land
when
we
discerned
the
signs
of
impending
events
we
decided
wilderness
and
there
separated
and
alone
led
for
two
years
a
life
of
complete
solitude
from
our
eyes
there
rained
tears
of
anguish
and
in
our
bleeding
heart
there
surged
an
ocean
of
agonizing
pain
many
a
night
we
had
no
food
for
sustenance
and
many
a
day
our
body
found
no
rest
by
him
who
hath
my
being
between
his
hands
notwithstanding
these
showers
of
afflictions
and
unceasing
calamities
our
soul
was
wrapt
in
blissful
joy
and
our
whole
being
evinced
an
ineffable
gladness
for
in
our
solitude
we
were
unaware
of
the
harm
or
benefit
the
health
or
ailment
of
any
soul
alone
we
communed
with
our
spirit
oblivious
of
the
world
and
all
that
is
therein
we
knew
not
however
that
the
mesh
of
divine
destiny
exceedeth
the
vastest
of
mortal
conceptions
and
the
dart
of
his
decree
transcendeth
the
boldest
of
human
designs
none
can
escape
the
snares
he
setteth
and
no
soul
can
find
release
except
through
submission
to
his
will
by
the
righteousness
of
god
our
withdrawal
contemplated
no
return
and
our
separation
hoped
for
no
reunion
the
one
object
of
our
retirement
was
to
avoid
becoming
a
subject
of
discord
among
the
faithful
a
source
of
disturbance
unto
our
companions
the
means
of
injury
to
any
soul
or
the
cause
of
sorrow
to
any
heart
beyond
these
we
cherished
no
other
intention
and
apart
from
them
we
had
no
end
in
view
and
yet
each
person
schemed
after
his
own
desire
and
pursued
his
own
idle
fancy
until
the
hour
when
from
the
mystic
source
there
came
the
summons
bidding
us
return
whence
we
came
surrendering
our
will
to
his
we
submitted
to
his
injunction
what
pen
can
recount
the
things
we
beheld
upon
our
return
two
years
have
elapsed
during
which
our
enemies
have
ceaselessly
and
assiduously
contrived
to
exterminate
us
whereunto
all
pp
opposition
of
mullás
after
his
return
from
this
retirement
his
fame
became
greater
than
ever
and
people
flocked
to
from
far
and
near
to
see
him
and
hear
his
teachings
jews
christians
and
zoroastrians
as
well
as
muḥammadans
became
interested
in
the
new
message
the
mullás
muḥammadan
doctors
however
took
up
a
hostile
attitude
and
persistently
plotted
to
effect
his
overthrow
on
a
certain
occasion
they
sent
one
of
their
number
to
interview
him
and
submit
to
him
certain
questions
the
envoy
found
the
answers
of
bahá
u
lláh
so
convincing
and
his
wisdom
so
amazing
although
evidently
not
acquired
by
study
that
he
was
obliged
to
confess
that
in
knowledge
and
understanding
bahá
u
lláh
was
peerless
in
order
however
that
the
mullás
who
had
sent
him
should
be
satisfied
as
to
the
reality
of
bahá
u
lláh
s
prophethood
he
asked
that
some
miracle
should
be
produced
as
proof
bahá
u
lláh
expressed
his
willingness
to
accept
the
suggestion
on
certain
conditions
declaring
that
if
the
mullás
would
agree
regarding
some
miracle
to
be
performed
and
would
sign
and
seal
a
document
to
the
effect
that
on
performance
of
this
miracle
they
would
confess
the
validity
of
his
mission
and
cease
to
oppose
him
he
would
furnish
the
desired
proof
or
else
stand
convicted
of
imposture
had
the
aim
of
the
mullás
been
to
get
at
the
truth
surely
here
was
their
opportunity
but
their
intention
was
far
otherwise
rightly
or
wrongly
they
meant
to
secure
a
decision
in
their
own
favor
they
feared
the
truth
and
fled
from
the
daring
challenge
this
discomfiture
however
only
spurred
them
on
to
devise
fresh
plots
for
the
eradication
of
the
oppressed
sect
the
consul
general
of
persia
in
came
to
their
assistance
and
sent
repeated
messages
to
the
to
the
effect
that
bahá
u
lláh
was
injuring
the
muḥammadan
religion
more
than
ever
still
exerting
a
malign
influence
on
persia
and
that
he
ought
therefore
to
be
banished
to
some
more
distant
place
it
was
characteristic
of
bahá
u
lláh
that
at
this
crisis
when
at
the
instigation
of
the
muḥammadan
mullás
the
persian
and
turkish
governments
were
combining
their
efforts
to
eradicate
the
movement
he
remained
calm
and
serene
encouraging
and
inspiring
his
followers
and
writing
imperishable
words
of
consolation
and
guidance
abdu
relates
how
the
hidden
words
were
written
at
this
time
bahá
u
lláh
would
often
go
for
a
walk
along
the
bank
of
the
tigris
he
would
come
back
looking
very
happy
and
write
down
those
lyric
gems
of
wise
counsel
which
have
brought
help
and
healing
to
thousands
of
aching
and
troubled
hearts
for
years
only
a
few
manuscript
copies
of
the
hidden
words
were
in
existence
and
these
had
to
be
carefully
concealed
lest
they
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
enemies
that
abounded
but
now
this
little
volume
is
probably
the
best
known
of
all
bahá
u
lláh
s
works
and
is
read
in
every
quarter
of
the
globe
the
book
of
íqán
is
another
work
of
bahá
u
lláh
s
written
about
the
same
period
towards
the
end
of
his
sojourn
at
declaration
at
ridván
near
baghdád
after
much
negotiation
at
the
request
of
the
persian
government
an
order
was
issued
by
the
turkish
government
summoning
bahá
u
lláh
to
constantinople
on
receipt
of
this
new
his
followers
were
in
consternation
they
besieged
the
house
of
their
beloved
leader
to
such
an
extent
that
the
family
encamped
in
the
garden
of
najíb
outside
the
town
for
twelve
days
while
the
caravan
was
being
prepared
for
the
long
journey
it
was
during
these
twelve
days
april
to
may
nineteen
years
after
the
báb
s
declaration
that
bahá
u
lláh
announced
to
several
of
his
followers
the
glad
tidings
that
he
was
the
one
whose
coming
had
been
foretold
by
the
chosen
of
god
the
promised
one
of
all
the
prophets
the
garden
where
this
memorable
declaration
took
place
has
become
known
to
bahá
ís
as
the
garden
of
ridván
and
the
days
bahá
u
lláh
spent
there
are
commemorated
in
the
feast
of
ridván
which
is
held
annually
on
the
anniversary
of
those
twelve
days
during
those
days
bahá
u
lláh
instead
of
being
sad
or
depressed
showed
the
greatest
joy
dignity
and
power
his
followers
became
happy
and
enthusiastic
and
great
crowds
came
to
pay
their
respects
to
him
all
the
notables
of
even
the
governor
himself
came
to
honor
the
departing
prisoner
constantinople
and
adrianople
the
journey
to
constantinople
lasted
between
three
and
four
months
the
party
consisting
of
bahá
u
lláh
with
members
of
his
family
and
disciples
arrived
in
constantinople
they
found
themselves
prisoners
in
a
small
house
in
which
they
were
very
much
overcrowded
later
they
got
somewhat
better
quarters
but
after
four
months
they
were
again
moved
on
this
time
to
adrianople
the
journey
to
adrianople
although
it
lasted
but
a
few
days
was
the
most
terrible
they
had
yet
undertaken
snow
fell
heavily
most
of
the
time
and
as
they
were
destitute
of
proper
clothing
and
food
their
sufferings
were
extreme
for
the
first
winter
in
adrianople
bahá
u
lláh
and
his
family
numbering
twelve
persons
were
accommodated
in
a
small
house
of
three
rooms
comfortless
and
vermin
infested
in
the
spring
they
were
given
a
more
comfortable
abode
they
remained
in
adrianople
over
four
and
a
half
years
here
bahá
u
lláh
resumed
his
teaching
and
gathered
about
him
a
large
following
he
publicly
announced
his
mission
and
was
enthusiastically
accepted
by
the
majority
of
the
bábís
who
were
known
thereafter
as
bahá
ís
a
minority
however
under
the
leadership
of
bahá
u
lláh
s
half
brother
mírzá
yaḥyá
become
violently
opposed
to
him
and
joined
with
their
former
enemies
the
ihs
in
plotting
for
his
overthrow
great
troubles
ensued
and
at
last
the
turkish
government
banished
both
bábís
and
bahá
ís
from
adrianople
exiling
bahá
u
lláh
and
his
followers
to
akká
in
palestine
where
they
arrived
according
to
nabíl
on
august
while
mírzá
yaḥyá
and
his
party
were
sent
to
cyprus
letters
to
kings
about
this
time
bahá
u
lláh
wrote
his
famous
letter
to
the
sulṭán
of
turkey
many
of
the
crowned
heads
of
europe
the
pope
and
the
of
persia
later
in
his
he
addressed
other
sovereigns
the
rulers
and
presidents
of
america
the
leaders
of
religion
in
general
and
the
generality
of
mankind
to
all
he
announced
his
mission
and
called
upon
them
to
bend
their
energies
to
the
establishment
of
true
religion
just
government
and
international
peace
in
his
letter
to
the
he
powerfully
pleaded
the
cause
of
the
oppressed
bábs
and
asked
to
be
brought
face
to
face
with
those
who
had
instigated
their
persecution
needless
to
say
this
request
was
not
complied
with
badí
the
young
and
devoted
bahá
í
who
delivered
the
letter
of
bahá
u
lláh
was
seized
and
martyred
with
fearful
tortures
hot
bricks
being
pressed
on
his
flesh
in
the
same
letter
bahá
u
lláh
gives
a
most
moving
account
of
his
own
sufferings
and
longings
o
king
i
have
seen
in
the
way
of
god
what
no
eye
hath
seen
and
no
ear
hath
heard
friends
have
disclaimed
me
ways
are
straitened
unto
me
the
pool
of
safety
is
dried
up
the
plain
of
ease
is
scorched
yellow
how
many
calamities
have
descended
and
how
many
will
descend
i
walk
advancing
toward
the
mighty
the
bounteous
while
behind
me
glides
the
serpent
my
eyes
rain
down
tears
until
my
bed
is
drenched
but
my
sorrow
is
not
for
myself
by
god
my
head
longeth
for
the
spears
for
the
love
of
its
lord
and
i
never
pass
by
a
tree
but
my
heart
addresseth
it
saying
o
would
that
thou
wert
cut
down
in
my
name
and
my
body
were
crucified
upon
thee
in
the
way
of
my
lord
yea
because
i
see
mankind
going
astray
in
their
intoxication
and
they
know
it
not
they
have
exalted
their
lusts
and
put
aside
their
god
as
though
they
took
the
command
of
god
for
a
mockery
a
sport
and
a
plaything
and
they
think
that
they
do
well
and
that
they
are
harboured
in
the
citadel
of
security
the
matter
is
not
as
they
suppose
they
shall
see
what
they
now
deny
we
are
about
to
shift
from
this
most
remote
place
of
banishment
adrianople
unto
the
prison
of
acre
and
according
to
what
they
say
it
is
assuredly
the
most
desolate
of
the
cities
of
the
world
the
most
unsightly
of
them
in
appearance
the
most
detestable
in
climate
and
the
foulest
in
water
it
is
as
though
it
were
the
metropolis
of
the
owl
there
is
not
heard
from
its
regions
aught
save
the
sound
of
its
hooting
and
in
it
they
intend
to
imprison
the
servant
and
to
shut
in
our
faces
the
doors
of
leniency
and
take
away
from
us
the
good
things
of
the
life
of
the
world
during
what
remaineth
of
our
days
by
god
though
weariness
should
weaken
me
and
hunger
should
destroy
me
though
my
couch
should
be
made
of
the
hard
rock
and
my
associates
of
the
beasts
of
the
desert
i
will
not
blench
but
will
be
patient
as
the
resolute
and
determined
are
patient
in
the
strength
of
god
the
king
of
the
creator
of
the
nations
and
under
all
circumstances
i
give
thanks
unto
god
and
we
hope
of
his
graciousness
exalted
is
he
that
he
will
render
all
men
s
faces
sincere
toward
him
the
mighty
the
bounteous
verily
he
answereth
him
who
prayeth
unto
him
and
is
near
unto
him
who
calleth
on
him
and
we
ask
him
to
make
this
dark
calamity
a
buckler
for
the
body
of
his
saints
and
to
protect
them
thereby
from
sharp
swords
and
piercing
blades
through
affliction
hath
his
light
shone
and
his
praise
been
bright
unceasingly
this
hath
been
his
method
through
past
ages
and
bygone
times
a
traveller
s
narrative
episode
of
the
báb
pp
imprisonment
in
akká
at
that
time
akká
acre
was
a
prison
city
to
which
the
worst
criminals
were
sent
from
all
parts
of
the
turkish
empire
on
arriving
there
after
a
miserable
sea
journey
bahá
u
lláh
and
his
followers
about
eighty
to
in
number
including
men
women
and
children
were
imprisoned
in
the
army
barracks
the
place
was
dirty
and
cheerless
in
the
extreme
there
were
no
beds
or
comforts
of
any
sort
the
food
supplied
was
wretched
and
inadequate
so
much
so
that
after
a
time
the
prisoners
begged
to
be
allowed
to
buy
their
food
for
themselves
during
the
first
few
days
the
children
were
crying
continually
and
sleep
was
almost
impossible
malaria
dysentery
and
other
diseases
soon
broke
out
and
everyone
in
the
company
fell
sick
with
the
exception
of
two
three
succumbed
to
their
sickness
and
the
sufferings
of
the
survivors
were
indescribable
this
rigorous
imprisonment
lasted
for
over
two
years
during
which
time
none
of
the
bahá
ís
were
allowed
outside
the
prison
door
except
four
men
carefully
guarded
who
went
out
daily
to
buy
food
during
the
imprisonment
in
the
barracks
visitors
were
rigidly
excluded
several
of
the
bahá
ís
of
persia
came
all
the
way
on
foot
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
their
beloved
leader
but
were
refused
admittance
within
the
city
walls
they
used
to
got
to
a
place
on
the
plain
outside
the
third
moat
from
which
they
could
see
the
windows
of
bahá
u
lláh
s
quarters
he
would
show
himself
to
them
at
one
of
the
windows
and
after
gazing
on
him
from
afar
they
would
weep
and
return
to
their
homes
fired
with
new
zeal
for
sacrifice
and
service
restrictions
relaxed
at
last
the
imprisonment
was
mitigated
a
mobilization
of
turkish
troops
occurred
and
the
barracks
were
required
for
soldiers
bahá
u
lláh
and
his
family
were
transferred
to
a
house
by
themselves
and
the
rest
of
the
party
were
accommodated
in
a
caravanserai
in
the
town
bahá
u
lláh
was
confined
for
seven
more
years
in
this
house
in
a
small
room
near
that
in
which
he
was
imprisoned
thirteen
of
his
household
including
both
sexes
had
to
accommodate
themselves
as
best
they
could
in
the
earlier
part
of
their
stay
in
this
house
they
suffered
greatly
from
insufficiency
of
accommodation
inadequate
food
supply
and
lack
of
the
ordinary
conveniences
of
life
after
a
time
however
a
few
additional
rooms
were
placed
at
their
disposal
and
they
were
able
to
live
in
comparative
comfort
from
the
time
bahá
u
lláh
and
his
companions
left
the
barracks
visitors
were
allowed
to
see
them
and
gradually
the
severe
restrictions
imposed
by
the
imperial
firmans
were
more
and
more
left
in
abeyance
although
now
and
then
reimposed
for
a
time
prison
gates
opened
even
when
the
imprisonment
was
at
its
worst
the
bahá
ís
were
not
dismayed
and
their
serene
confidence
was
never
shaken
while
in
the
barracks
at
akká
bahá
u
lláh
wrote
to
some
friends
fear
not
these
doors
shall
be
opened
my
tent
shall
be
pitched
on
mount
carmel
and
the
utmost
joy
shall
be
this
declaration
was
a
great
source
of
consolation
to
his
followers
and
in
due
course
it
was
literally
fulfilled
the
story
of
how
the
prison
doors
were
opened
had
best
be
told
in
the
words
of
abdu
as
translated
by
his
grandson
shoghi
effendi
bahá
u
lláh
loved
the
beauty
and
verdure
of
the
country
one
day
he
passed
the
remark
i
have
not
gazed
on
verdure
for
nine
years
the
country
is
the
world
of
the
soul
the
city
is
the
world
of
when
i
heard
indirectly
of
this
saying
i
realized
that
he
was
longing
for
the
country
and
i
was
sure
that
whatever
i
could
do
towards
the
carrying
out
of
his
wish
would
be
successful
there
was
in
akká
at
that
time
a
man
called
muḥammad
safwat
who
was
very
much
opposed
to
us
he
had
a
palace
called
mazra
ih
about
four
miles
north
of
the
city
a
lovely
place
surrounded
by
gardens
and
with
a
stream
of
running
water
i
went
and
called
on
this
at
his
home
i
said
you
have
left
the
palace
empty
and
are
living
in
he
replied
i
am
an
invalid
and
can
not
leave
the
city
if
i
go
there
it
is
lonely
and
i
am
cut
off
from
my
i
said
while
you
are
not
living
there
and
the
place
is
empty
let
it
to
he
was
amazed
at
the
proposal
but
soon
consented
i
got
the
house
at
a
very
low
rent
about
five
pounds
per
annum
paid
him
for
five
years
and
made
a
contract
i
sent
laborers
to
repair
the
place
and
put
the
garden
in
order
and
had
a
bath
built
i
also
had
a
carriage
prepared
for
the
use
of
the
blessed
beauty
one
day
i
determined
to
go
and
see
the
place
for
myself
notwithstanding
the
repeated
injunctions
given
in
successive
firmans
that
we
were
on
no
account
to
pass
the
limits
of
the
city
walls
i
walked
out
through
the
city
gate
gendarmes
were
on
guard
but
they
made
no
objection
so
i
proceeded
straight
to
the
palace
the
next
day
i
again
went
out
with
some
friends
and
officials
unmolested
and
unopposed
although
the
guards
and
sentinels
stood
on
both
sides
of
the
city
gates
another
day
i
arranged
a
banquet
spread
a
table
under
the
pine
trees
of
bahjí
and
gathered
round
it
the
notables
and
officials
of
the
town
in
the
evening
we
all
returned
to
the
town
together
one
day
i
went
to
the
holy
presence
of
the
blessed
beauty
and
said
the
palace
at
mazra
ih
is
ready
for
you
and
a
carriage
to
drive
you
at
that
time
there
were
no
carriages
in
akká
or
haifa
he
refused
to
go
saying
i
am
a
later
i
requested
him
again
but
got
the
same
answer
i
went
so
far
as
to
ask
him
a
third
time
but
he
still
said
no
and
i
did
not
dare
to
insist
further
there
was
however
in
akká
a
certain
muḥammadan
a
man
with
considerable
influence
who
loved
bahá
u
lláh
and
was
greatly
favored
by
him
i
called
this
and
explained
the
position
to
him
i
said
you
are
daring
go
tonight
to
his
holy
presence
fall
on
your
knees
before
him
take
hold
of
his
hands
and
do
not
let
go
until
he
promises
to
leave
the
city
he
was
an
arab
he
went
directly
to
bahá
u
lláh
and
sat
down
close
to
his
knees
he
took
hold
of
the
hands
of
the
blessed
beauty
and
kissed
them
and
asked
why
do
you
not
leave
the
city
he
said
i
am
a
the
replied
god
forbid
who
has
the
power
to
make
you
a
prisoner
you
have
kept
yourself
in
prison
it
was
your
own
will
to
be
imprisoned
and
now
i
beg
you
to
come
out
and
go
to
the
palace
it
is
beautiful
and
verdant
the
trees
are
lovely
and
the
oranges
like
balls
of
fire
as
often
as
the
blessed
beauty
said
i
am
a
prisoner
it
can
not
be
the
took
his
hands
and
kissed
them
for
a
whole
hour
he
kept
on
pleading
at
last
bahá
u
lláh
said
very
good
and
the
s
patience
and
persistence
were
rewarded
he
came
to
me
with
great
joy
to
give
the
glad
news
of
his
holiness
s
consent
in
spite
of
the
strict
firman
of
abdu
azíz
which
prohibited
my
meeting
or
having
any
intercourse
with
the
blessed
perfection
i
took
the
carriage
the
next
day
and
drove
with
him
to
the
palace
no
one
made
any
objection
i
left
him
there
and
returned
myself
to
the
city
for
two
years
he
remained
in
that
charming
and
lovely
spot
then
it
was
decided
to
remove
to
another
place
at
bahjí
it
so
happened
than
an
epidemic
disease
had
broken
out
at
bahjí
and
the
proprietor
of
the
house
fled
away
in
distress
with
all
his
family
ready
to
offer
the
house
free
of
charge
to
any
applicant
we
took
the
house
at
a
very
low
rent
and
there
the
doors
of
majesty
and
true
sovereignty
were
flung
wide
open
bahá
u
lláh
was
nominally
a
prisoner
for
the
drastic
firmans
of
sulṭán
abdu
aziz
were
never
repealed
yet
in
reality
he
showed
forth
such
nobility
and
dignity
in
his
life
and
bearing
that
he
was
reverenced
by
all
and
the
rulers
of
palestine
envied
his
influence
and
power
governors
and
mutasarrifs
generals
and
local
officials
would
humbly
request
the
honor
of
attaining
his
request
to
which
he
seldom
acceded
on
one
occasion
a
governor
of
the
city
implored
this
favor
on
the
ground
of
his
being
ordered
by
higher
authorities
to
visit
with
a
certain
general
the
blessed
perfection
the
request
being
granted
the
general
who
was
a
very
corpulent
individual
a
european
was
so
impressed
by
the
majestic
presence
of
bahá
u
lláh
that
he
remained
kneeling
on
the
ground
near
the
door
such
was
the
diffidence
of
both
visitors
that
it
was
only
after
repeated
invitations
from
bahá
u
lláh
that
they
were
induced
to
smoke
the
narguileh
pipe
offered
to
them
even
then
they
only
touched
it
with
their
lips
and
then
putting
it
aside
folded
their
arms
and
sat
in
an
attitude
of
such
humility
and
respect
as
to
astonish
all
those
who
were
present
the
loving
reverence
of
friends
the
consideration
and
respect
that
were
shown
by
all
officials
and
notables
the
inflow
of
pilgrims
and
seekers
after
truth
the
spirit
of
devotion
and
service
that
was
manifest
all
around
the
majestic
and
kingly
countenance
of
the
blessed
perfection
the
effectiveness
of
his
command
the
number
of
his
zealous
bore
witness
to
the
fact
that
bahá
u
lláh
was
in
reality
no
prisoner
but
a
king
of
kings
two
despotic
sovereigns
were
against
him
two
powerful
autocratic
rulers
yet
even
when
confined
in
their
own
prisons
he
addressed
them
in
very
austere
terms
like
a
king
addressing
his
subjects
afterwards
in
spite
of
severe
firmans
he
lived
at
bahjí
like
a
prince
often
he
would
say
verily
verily
the
most
wretched
prison
has
been
converted
into
a
paradise
of
surely
such
a
thing
has
not
been
witnessed
since
the
creation
of
the
world
life
at
bahjí
having
in
his
earlier
years
of
hardship
shown
how
to
glorify
god
in
a
state
of
poverty
and
ignominy
bahá
u
lláh
in
his
later
years
at
bahjí
showed
how
to
glorify
god
in
a
state
of
honor
and
affluence
the
offering
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
devoted
followers
placed
at
his
disposal
large
funds
which
he
was
called
upon
to
administer
although
his
life
at
bahjí
has
been
described
as
truly
regal
in
the
highest
sense
of
the
word
yet
it
must
not
be
imagined
that
it
was
characterized
by
material
splendor
or
extravagance
the
blessed
perfection
and
his
family
lived
in
very
simple
and
modest
fashion
and
expenditure
on
selfish
luxury
was
a
think
unknown
in
that
household
near
his
home
the
believers
prepared
a
beautiful
garden
called
ridván
in
which
he
often
spent
many
consecutive
days
or
even
weeks
sleeping
at
night
in
a
little
cottage
in
the
garden
occasionally
he
went
further
afield
he
made
several
visits
to
akká
and
haifa
and
on
more
than
one
occasion
pitched
his
tent
on
mount
carmel
as
he
had
predicted
when
imprisoned
in
the
barracks
at
akká
the
time
of
bahá
u
lláh
was
spent
for
the
most
part
in
prayer
and
meditation
in
writing
the
sacred
books
revealing
tablets
and
in
spiritual
education
of
the
friends
in
order
to
give
him
entire
freedom
for
this
great
work
abdu
undertook
the
arrangement
of
all
other
affairs
even
meeting
the
mullás
poets
and
members
of
the
government
all
of
these
were
delighted
and
happy
through
meeting
abdu
and
entirely
satisfied
with
his
explanation
and
talks
and
although
they
had
not
met
bahá
u
lláh
himself
they
became
full
of
friendly
feeling
towards
him
through
their
acquaintanceship
with
his
son
for
abdu
s
attitude
caused
them
to
understand
the
station
of
his
father
the
distinguished
orientalist
the
late
professor
edward
browne
of
the
university
of
cambridge
visited
bahá
u
lláh
at
bahjí
in
the
year
and
recorded
his
impressions
as
follows
my
conductor
paused
for
a
moment
while
i
removed
my
shoes
then
with
a
quick
movement
of
the
hand
he
withdrew
and
as
i
passed
replaced
the
curtain
and
i
found
myself
in
a
large
apartment
along
the
upper
end
of
which
ran
a
low
divan
while
on
the
side
opposite
to
the
door
were
placed
two
or
three
chairs
though
i
dimly
suspected
whither
i
was
going
and
whom
i
was
to
behold
for
no
distinct
intimation
had
been
given
to
me
a
second
or
two
elapsed
ere
with
a
throb
of
wonder
and
awe
i
became
definitely
conscious
that
the
room
was
not
untenanted
in
the
corner
where
the
divan
met
the
wall
sat
a
wondrous
and
venerable
figure
crowned
with
a
felt
of
the
kind
called
taj
by
dervishes
but
of
unusual
height
and
make
round
the
base
of
which
was
wound
a
small
white
turban
the
face
of
him
on
whom
i
gazed
i
can
never
forget
though
i
can
not
describe
it
those
piercing
eyes
seemed
to
read
one
s
very
soul
power
and
authority
sat
on
that
ample
brow
while
the
deep
lines
on
the
forehead
and
face
implied
an
age
which
the
hair
and
beard
flowing
down
in
indistinguishable
luxuriance
almost
to
the
waist
seemed
to
belie
no
need
to
ask
in
whose
presence
i
stood
as
i
bowed
myself
before
one
who
is
the
object
of
a
devotion
and
love
which
kings
might
envy
and
emperors
sigh
for
in
vain
a
mild
dignified
voice
bade
me
be
seated
and
then
continued
praise
be
to
god
that
thou
has
attained
thou
has
come
to
see
a
prisoner
and
an
exile
we
desire
but
the
good
of
the
world
and
the
happiness
of
the
nations
yet
they
deem
us
a
stirrer
up
of
strife
and
sedition
worthy
of
bondage
and
banishment
that
all
nations
should
become
one
in
faith
and
all
men
as
brothers
that
the
bonds
of
affection
and
unity
between
the
sons
of
men
should
be
strengthened
that
diversity
of
religion
should
cease
and
differences
of
race
be
harm
is
there
in
this
yet
so
it
shall
be
these
fruitless
strifes
these
ruinous
wars
shall
pass
away
and
the
most
great
peace
shall
come
do
not
you
in
europe
need
this
also
is
not
this
that
which
christ
foretold
yet
do
we
see
your
kings
and
rulers
lavishing
their
treasures
more
freely
on
means
for
the
destruction
of
the
human
race
than
on
that
which
would
conduce
to
the
happiness
of
mankind
these
strifes
and
this
bloodshed
and
discord
must
cease
and
all
men
be
as
one
kindred
and
one
family
let
not
a
man
glory
in
this
that
he
loves
his
country
let
him
rather
glory
in
this
that
he
loves
his
kind
such
so
far
as
i
can
recall
them
were
the
words
which
besides
many
others
i
heard
from
behá
let
those
who
read
them
consider
well
with
themselves
whether
such
doctrines
merit
death
and
bonds
and
whether
the
world
is
more
likely
gain
or
lose
by
their
to
a
traveller
s
narrative
episode
of
the
báb
pp
ascension
thus
simply
and
serenely
did
bahá
u
lláh
pass
the
evening
of
his
life
on
earth
until
after
an
attack
of
fever
he
passed
away
on
the
of
may
at
the
age
of
among
the
last
tablets
he
revealed
was
his
will
and
testament
which
he
wrote
with
his
own
hand
and
duly
signed
and
sealed
nine
days
after
his
death
the
seals
were
broken
by
his
eldest
son
in
the
presence
of
members
of
the
family
and
a
few
friends
and
the
contents
of
the
short
but
remarkable
document
were
made
known
by
this
will
abdu
was
constituted
his
father
s
representative
and
the
expounder
of
his
teachings
and
the
family
and
relatives
of
bahá
u
lláh
and
all
believers
were
instructed
to
turn
to
him
and
obey
him
by
this
arrangement
sectarianism
and
division
were
provided
against
and
the
unity
of
the
cause
assured
prophethood
of
bahá
u
lláh
it
is
important
to
have
clear
ideas
of
bahá
u
lláh
s
prophethood
his
utterances
like
those
of
other
divine
manifestations
may
be
divided
into
two
classes
in
one
of
which
he
writes
or
speaks
simply
as
a
man
who
has
been
charged
by
god
with
a
message
to
his
fellows
while
in
the
other
class
the
words
purport
to
be
the
direct
utterance
of
god
himself
he
writes
in
the
book
of
íqán
we
have
already
in
the
foregoing
pages
assigned
two
stations
unto
each
of
the
luminaries
arising
from
the
daysprings
of
eternal
holiness
one
of
these
stations
the
station
of
essential
unity
we
have
already
explained
no
distinction
do
we
make
between
any
of
qur
án
the
other
is
the
station
of
distinction
and
pertaineth
to
the
world
of
creation
and
to
be
the
limitations
thereof
in
this
respect
each
manifestation
of
god
hath
a
distinct
individuality
a
definitely
prescribed
mission
a
predestined
revelation
and
specially
designated
limitations
each
one
of
them
is
known
by
a
different
name
is
characterized
by
a
special
attribute
fulfils
a
definite
mission
and
is
entrusted
with
a
particular
revelation
even
as
he
saith
some
of
the
apostles
we
have
caused
to
excel
the
others
to
some
god
hath
spoken
some
he
hath
raise
and
exalted
and
to
jesus
son
of
mary
we
gave
manifest
signs
and
we
strengthen
him
with
the
holy
qur
án
thus
viewed
from
the
standpoint
of
their
oneness
and
sublime
detachment
the
attributes
of
godhead
divinity
supreme
singleness
and
inmost
essence
have
been
and
are
applicable
to
those
essences
of
being
inasmuch
as
they
all
abide
on
the
throne
of
divine
revelation
and
are
established
upon
the
seat
of
divine
concealment
through
their
appearance
the
revelation
of
god
is
made
manifest
and
by
their
countenance
the
beauty
of
god
is
revealed
thus
it
is
that
the
accents
of
god
himself
have
been
heard
uttered
by
these
manifestations
of
the
divine
being
viewed
in
the
light
of
their
second
station
of
distinction
differentiation
temporal
limitations
characteristics
and
standards
manifest
absolute
servitude
utter
destitution
and
complete
even
as
he
saith
i
am
the
servant
of
god
i
am
but
a
man
like
were
any
of
the
manifestations
of
god
to
declare
i
am
god
he
verily
speaketh
the
truth
and
no
doubt
attacheth
thereto
for
it
hath
been
repeatedly
demonstrated
that
through
their
revelation
their
attributes
and
names
the
revelation
of
god
his
name
and
his
attributes
are
made
manifest
in
the
world
thus
he
hath
revealed
those
shafts
were
god
s
not
thine
qur
án
and
also
he
saith
in
truth
they
who
plighted
fealty
unto
thee
really
plighted
that
fealty
unto
qur
án
and
were
any
of
them
to
voice
the
utterance
i
am
the
messenger
of
god
he
also
speaketh
the
truth
the
indubitable
truth
even
as
he
saith
muḥammad
is
not
the
father
of
any
man
among
you
but
he
is
the
messenger
of
viewed
in
this
light
they
are
all
but
messengers
of
that
ideal
king
that
unchangeable
essence
and
were
they
all
to
proclaim
i
am
the
seal
of
prophets
they
verily
utter
but
the
truth
beyond
the
faintest
shadow
of
doubt
for
they
are
all
but
one
person
one
soul
one
spirit
one
being
one
revelation
they
are
all
the
manifestation
of
the
beginning
and
the
end
the
first
and
the
last
the
seen
and
hidden
of
which
pertain
to
him
who
is
the
innermost
spirit
of
spirits
and
eternal
essence
of
essences
and
were
they
to
say
we
are
the
servants
of
god
qur
án
this
also
is
a
manifest
and
indisputable
fact
for
they
have
been
made
manifest
in
the
uttermost
state
of
servitude
a
servitude
the
like
of
which
no
man
can
possibly
attain
thus
in
moments
in
which
these
essences
of
being
were
deeply
immersed
beneath
the
oceans
of
ancient
and
everlasting
holiness
or
when
they
soared
to
the
loftiest
summits
of
divine
mysteries
they
claimed
their
utterance
to
be
the
voice
of
divinity
the
call
of
god
himself
were
the
eye
of
discernment
to
be
opened
it
would
recognize
that
in
this
very
state
they
have
considered
themselves
utterly
effaced
and
in
the
face
of
him
whom
is
the
the
incorruptible
methinks
they
have
regarded
themselves
as
utter
nothingness
and
deemed
their
mention
in
that
court
an
act
of
blasphemy
for
the
slightest
whisperings
of
self
within
such
a
court
is
an
evidence
of
and
independent
existence
in
the
eyes
of
them
that
have
attained
unto
that
court
such
a
suggestion
is
itself
a
grievous
transgression
how
much
more
grievous
would
it
be
were
aught
else
to
be
mentioned
in
that
presence
were
man
s
heart
his
tongue
his
mind
or
his
soul
to
be
busied
with
anyone
but
the
were
his
eyes
to
behold
any
countenance
other
than
his
beauty
were
his
ear
to
be
inclined
to
any
melody
but
his
voice
and
were
his
feet
to
tread
any
way
but
his
way
in
this
day
the
breeze
of
god
is
wafted
and
his
spirit
hath
pervaded
all
things
such
is
the
outpouring
of
his
grace
that
the
pen
is
stilled
and
the
tongue
is
speechless
by
virtue
of
this
station
they
have
claimed
for
themselves
the
voice
of
divinity
and
the
like
whilst
by
virtue
of
their
station
of
messengership
they
have
declared
themselves
the
messengers
of
god
in
every
instance
they
have
voiced
an
utterance
that
would
conform
to
the
requirements
of
the
occasion
and
have
ascribed
all
these
declarations
to
themselves
declarations
ranging
from
the
divine
revelation
to
the
realm
of
creation
and
from
the
domain
of
divinity
even
unto
the
domain
of
earthly
existence
thus
it
is
that
whatsoever
be
their
utterance
whether
it
pertain
to
the
realm
of
divinity
lordship
prophethood
messengership
guardianship
apostelship
or
servitude
all
is
true
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
therefore
these
sayings
which
we
have
quoted
in
support
of
our
argument
must
be
attentively
considered
that
the
divergent
utterances
of
the
manifestations
of
the
unseen
and
daysprings
of
holiness
may
cease
to
agitate
the
soul
and
perplex
the
when
bahá
u
lláh
speaks
as
a
man
the
station
he
claims
for
himself
is
that
of
utter
humility
of
annihilation
in
what
distinguishes
the
manifestation
in
his
human
personality
from
other
men
is
the
completeness
of
his
as
well
as
the
perfection
of
his
powers
under
all
circumstances
he
is
able
to
say
as
did
jesus
in
the
garden
of
gethsemane
nevertheless
not
my
will
but
thine
be
thus
in
his
epistle
to
the
bahá
u
lláh
says
o
king
i
was
but
a
man
like
others
asleep
upon
my
couch
when
lo
the
breezes
of
the
were
wafted
over
me
and
taught
me
the
knowledge
of
all
that
hath
been
this
thing
is
not
from
me
but
from
one
who
is
almighty
and
and
he
bade
me
lift
up
my
voice
between
earth
and
heaven
and
for
this
there
befell
me
what
hath
caused
the
tears
of
every
man
of
understanding
to
flow
the
learning
current
amongst
men
i
studied
not
their
schools
i
entered
not
this
is
but
a
leaf
which
the
winds
of
the
will
of
thy
lord
the
almighty
the
have
stirred
can
it
be
still
when
the
tempestuous
winds
are
blowing
nay
by
him
who
is
the
lord
of
all
names
and
attributes
they
move
it
as
they
list
the
evanescent
is
as
nothing
before
him
who
is
the
his
summons
hath
reached
me
and
caused
me
to
speak
his
praise
amidst
all
people
i
was
indeed
as
one
dead
when
his
behest
was
uttered
the
hand
of
the
will
of
thy
lord
the
compassionate
the
merciful
transformed
me
can
any
one
speak
forth
of
his
own
accord
that
for
which
all
men
both
high
and
low
will
protest
against
him
nay
by
him
who
taught
the
pen
the
eternal
mysteries
save
him
whom
the
grace
of
the
almighty
the
hath
tablet
to
the
king
of
persia
as
quoted
in
the
promised
day
is
come
pp
as
jesus
washed
his
disciples
feet
so
bahá
u
lláh
used
sometimes
to
cook
food
and
perform
other
lowly
offices
for
his
followers
he
was
a
servant
of
the
servants
and
gloried
only
in
servitude
content
to
sleep
on
a
bare
floor
if
need
be
to
live
on
bread
and
water
or
even
at
times
on
what
he
called
the
divine
nourishment
that
is
to
say
hunger
his
perfect
humility
was
seen
in
his
profound
reverence
for
nature
for
human
nature
and
especially
for
the
saints
prophets
and
martyrs
to
him
all
things
spoke
of
god
from
the
meanest
to
the
greatest
his
human
personality
had
been
chosen
by
god
to
become
the
divine
mouthpiece
and
pen
it
was
not
of
his
own
will
that
he
had
assumed
this
position
of
unparalleled
difficulty
and
hardship
as
jesus
said
father
if
it
be
possible
let
this
cup
pass
from
me
so
bahá
u
lláh
said
had
another
exponent
or
speaker
been
found
we
would
not
have
made
ourself
an
object
of
censure
derision
and
calumnies
on
the
part
of
the
people
tablet
of
but
the
divine
call
was
clear
and
imperative
and
he
obeyed
god
s
will
became
his
will
and
god
s
pleasure
his
pleasure
and
with
radiant
acquiescence
he
declared
verily
i
say
whatever
befalleth
in
the
path
of
god
is
the
beloved
of
the
soul
and
the
desire
of
the
heart
deadly
poison
in
his
path
is
pure
honey
and
every
tribulation
a
draught
of
crystal
to
the
son
of
the
wolf
at
other
times
as
we
have
mentioned
bahá
u
lláh
speaks
from
the
station
of
in
these
utterances
his
human
personality
is
so
completely
subservient
that
it
is
left
out
of
account
altogether
through
him
god
addresses
his
creatures
proclaiming
his
love
for
them
teaching
them
his
attributes
making
known
his
will
announcing
his
laws
for
their
guidance
and
pleading
for
their
love
their
allegiance
and
service
in
the
writings
of
bahá
u
lláh
the
utterance
frequently
changes
from
one
of
these
forms
to
another
sometimes
it
is
evidently
the
man
who
is
discoursing
then
without
a
break
the
writing
continues
as
if
god
were
speaking
in
the
first
person
even
when
speaking
as
a
man
however
bahá
u
lláh
speaks
as
god
s
messenger
as
a
living
example
of
entire
devotion
to
god
s
will
his
whole
life
is
actuated
by
the
holy
spirit
hence
no
hard
and
fast
line
can
be
drawn
between
the
human
and
divine
elements
in
his
life
or
teachings
god
tells
him
say
naught
is
seen
in
my
temple
but
the
temple
of
god
and
in
my
beauty
but
his
beauty
and
in
my
being
but
his
being
and
in
myself
but
himself
and
in
my
movement
but
his
movement
and
in
my
acquiescence
but
his
acquiescence
and
in
my
pen
but
his
pen
the
precious
the
say
there
hath
not
been
in
my
soul
but
the
truth
and
in
myself
naught
could
be
seen
but
his
mission
bahá
u
lláh
s
mission
in
the
world
is
to
bring
about
of
all
mankind
in
and
through
god
he
says
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
the
fruit
is
this
exalted
word
of
one
tree
are
all
ye
the
fruits
and
of
one
bough
the
leaves
let
not
man
glory
in
this
that
he
loves
his
country
but
let
him
rather
glory
in
this
that
he
loves
his
previous
prophets
have
heralded
an
age
of
peace
on
earth
goodwill
among
men
and
have
given
their
lives
to
hasten
its
advent
but
each
and
all
of
them
have
plainly
declared
that
this
blessed
consummation
would
be
reached
only
after
the
coming
of
the
lord
in
the
latter
days
when
the
wicked
would
be
judged
and
righteous
rewarded
zoroaster
foretold
three
thousand
years
of
conflict
before
the
advent
of
bahrám
the
who
would
overcome
ahrmán
the
spirit
of
evil
and
establish
a
reign
of
righteousness
and
peace
moses
foretold
a
long
period
of
exile
persecution
and
oppression
for
the
children
of
israel
before
the
lord
of
hosts
would
appear
to
gather
them
from
all
the
nations
to
destroy
the
oppressors
and
establish
his
kingdom
upon
earth
christ
said
think
not
that
i
am
come
to
send
peace
on
earth
i
came
not
to
send
peace
but
a
sword
matt
x
and
he
predicted
a
period
of
wars
and
rumors
of
wars
of
tribulations
and
afflictions
that
would
continue
till
the
coming
of
the
son
of
man
in
the
glory
of
the
muḥammad
declared
that
because
of
their
wrongdoings
alláh
had
put
enmity
and
hatred
among
both
jews
and
christians
that
would
last
until
the
day
of
resurrection
when
he
would
appear
to
judge
them
all
bahá
u
lláh
on
the
other
hand
announces
that
he
is
the
promised
one
of
all
these
divine
manifestation
in
whose
era
the
reign
of
peace
will
actually
be
established
this
statement
is
unprecedented
and
unique
yet
it
fits
in
wonderfully
with
the
signs
of
the
times
and
with
the
prophecies
of
all
the
great
prophets
bahá
u
lláh
revealed
with
incomparable
clearness
and
comprehensiveness
the
means
for
bringing
about
peace
and
unity
amongst
mankind
it
is
true
that
since
the
advent
of
bahá
u
lláh
there
have
been
until
now
war
and
destruction
on
an
unprecedented
scale
but
this
is
just
what
all
the
prophets
have
said
would
happen
at
the
dawn
of
the
great
and
terrible
day
of
the
lord
and
is
therefore
but
a
confirmation
of
the
view
that
the
coming
of
the
lord
is
not
only
at
hand
but
is
already
an
accomplished
fact
according
to
the
parable
of
christ
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
must
miserably
destroy
the
wicked
husbandmen
before
he
gives
the
vineyard
to
others
who
will
render
him
the
fruits
in
their
seasons
does
not
this
mean
that
at
the
coming
of
the
lord
dire
destruction
awaits
those
despotic
governments
avaricious
and
intolerant
priests
mullás
or
tyrannical
leaders
who
through
the
centuries
have
like
wicked
husbandmen
misruled
the
earth
and
misappropriated
its
fruits
there
may
be
terrible
events
and
unparalleled
calamities
yet
awhile
on
the
earth
but
bahá
u
lláh
assures
us
that
erelong
these
fruitless
strifes
these
ruinous
wars
shall
pass
away
and
the
most
great
peace
shall
war
and
strife
have
become
so
intolerable
in
their
destructiveness
that
mankind
must
find
deliverance
from
them
or
perish
the
fullness
of
time
has
come
and
with
it
the
promised
deliverer
his
writings
the
writings
of
bahá
u
lláh
are
most
comprehensive
in
their
range
dealing
with
every
phase
of
human
life
individual
and
social
with
things
material
and
things
spiritual
with
the
interpretation
of
ancient
and
modern
scriptures
and
with
prophetic
anticipations
of
both
the
near
and
distant
future
the
range
and
accuracy
of
his
knowledge
was
amazing
he
could
quote
and
expound
the
scriptures
of
the
various
religions
with
which
his
correspondents
or
questioners
were
familiar
in
convincing
and
authoritative
manner
although
apparently
he
had
never
had
the
ordinary
means
of
access
to
many
of
the
books
referred
to
he
declares
in
epistle
to
the
son
of
the
wolf
that
he
had
never
read
the
bayán
although
in
his
own
writings
he
shows
the
most
perfect
knowledge
and
understanding
of
the
báb
s
revelation
the
báb
as
we
have
seen
declared
that
his
revelation
the
bayán
was
inspired
by
and
emanated
from
him
whom
god
shall
make
manifest
with
the
single
exception
of
a
visit
from
professor
edward
granville
browne
to
whom
in
the
year
he
accorded
four
interviews
each
lasting
twenty
to
thirty
minutes
he
had
no
opportunities
of
intercourse
with
enlightened
western
thinkers
yet
his
writings
show
a
complete
grasp
of
the
social
political
and
religious
problems
of
the
western
world
and
even
his
enemies
had
to
admit
that
his
wisdom
and
knowledge
were
incomparable
the
circumstances
of
his
long
imprisonment
render
it
impossible
to
doubt
that
the
wealth
of
knowledge
shown
in
his
writings
must
have
been
acquired
from
some
spiritual
source
quite
independent
of
the
usual
means
of
study
or
instruction
and
the
help
of
books
or
teachers
sometimes
he
wrote
in
modern
persian
the
ordinary
language
of
his
fellow
countrymen
which
is
largely
admixed
with
arabic
at
other
times
as
when
addressing
learned
zoroastrians
he
wrote
in
the
purest
classical
persian
he
also
wrote
with
equal
fluency
in
arabic
sometimes
in
very
simple
language
sometimes
in
classical
style
somewhat
similar
to
that
of
the
qur
án
his
perfect
mastery
of
these
different
languages
and
styles
was
remarkable
because
of
his
entire
lack
of
literary
education
in
some
of
his
writings
the
way
of
holiness
is
pointed
out
in
such
simple
terms
that
the
wayfaring
men
though
fools
shall
not
err
therein
isaiah
xxv
in
others
there
is
a
wealth
of
poetic
imagery
profound
philosophy
and
allusions
to
muḥammadan
zoroastrian
and
other
scriptures
or
to
persian
and
arabic
literature
and
legends
such
as
only
the
poet
the
philosopher
or
the
scholar
can
adequately
appreciate
still
others
deal
with
advanced
stages
of
the
spiritual
life
and
are
to
be
understood
only
by
those
who
have
already
passed
through
the
earlier
stages
his
works
are
like
a
bountiful
table
provided
with
foods
and
delicacies
suited
to
the
needs
and
tastes
of
all
who
are
genuine
truth
seekers
it
is
because
of
this
that
his
cause
had
effect
among
the
learned
and
culture
spiritual
poets
and
writers
even
some
of
the
leaders
of
the
súfís
and
of
other
sets
and
some
of
the
political
ministers
who
were
writers
were
attracted
by
his
words
for
they
exceeded
those
of
all
other
writers
in
sweetness
and
depth
of
spiritual
meaning
the
bahá
í
spirit
from
his
place
of
confinement
in
distant
akká
bahá
u
lláh
stirred
his
native
land
of
persia
to
its
depths
and
not
only
persia
he
stirred
and
is
stirring
the
world
the
spirit
that
animated
him
and
his
followers
was
unfailingly
gentle
courteous
and
patient
yet
it
was
a
force
of
astonishing
vitality
and
transcendent
power
it
achieved
the
seemingly
impossible
it
changed
human
nature
men
who
yielded
to
its
influence
became
new
creatures
they
were
filled
with
a
love
a
faith
and
enthusiasm
compared
with
which
earthly
joys
and
sorrows
were
but
as
dust
in
the
balance
they
were
ready
to
face
lifelong
suffering
or
violent
death
with
perfect
equanimity
nay
with
radiant
joy
in
the
strength
of
fearless
dependence
on
god
most
wonderful
of
all
their
hearts
were
so
brimming
over
with
the
joy
of
a
new
life
as
to
leave
no
room
for
thoughts
of
bitterness
or
vindictiveness
against
their
oppressors
they
entirely
abandoned
the
use
of
violence
in
and
instead
of
bemoaning
their
fate
they
considered
themselves
the
most
fortunate
of
men
in
being
privileged
to
receive
this
new
and
glorious
revelation
and
to
spend
their
lives
or
shed
their
blood
testifying
to
its
truth
well
might
their
hearts
sing
with
joy
for
they
believed
that
god
the
supreme
the
eternal
the
beloved
had
spoken
to
them
through
human
lips
had
called
them
to
be
his
servants
and
friends
had
come
to
establish
his
kingdom
upon
earth
and
to
bring
the
priceless
boon
of
peace
to
a
warworn
world
such
was
the
faith
inspired
by
bahá
u
lláh
he
announced
his
own
mission
as
the
báb
had
foretold
that
he
would
and
thanks
to
the
devoted
labors
of
his
great
forerunner
there
were
thousands
ready
to
acclaim
his
who
had
shaken
off
superstitions
and
prejudices
and
were
waiting
with
pure
hearts
and
open
minds
for
the
manifestation
of
god
s
promised
glory
poverty
and
chains
sordid
circumstances
and
outward
ignominy
could
not
hide
from
them
the
spiritual
glory
of
their
these
dark
earthly
surroundings
only
served
to
enhance
the
brilliance
of
his
real
splendor
chapter
abdu
the
servant
of
bahá
when
the
ocean
of
my
presence
hath
ebbed
and
the
book
of
my
revelation
is
ended
turn
your
faces
towards
him
whom
god
hath
purposed
who
hath
branched
from
this
ancient
u
lláh
birth
and
childhood
abbás
effendi
who
afterwards
assumed
the
title
of
abdu
servant
of
bahá
was
the
eldest
son
of
bahá
u
lláh
he
was
born
in
ṭihrán
before
midnight
on
the
eve
of
the
of
may
the
very
same
night
in
which
the
báb
declared
his
mission
he
was
nine
years
of
age
when
his
father
to
whom
even
then
he
was
devotedly
attached
was
thrown
into
the
dungeon
in
ṭihrán
a
mob
sacked
their
house
and
the
family
were
stripped
of
their
possessions
and
left
in
destitution
abdu
tells
how
one
day
he
was
allowed
to
enter
the
prison
yard
to
see
his
beloved
father
when
he
came
out
for
his
daily
exercise
bahá
u
lláh
was
terribly
altered
so
ill
he
could
hardly
walk
his
hair
and
beard
unkempt
his
neck
galled
and
swollen
from
the
pressure
of
a
heavy
steel
collar
his
body
bent
by
the
weight
of
his
chains
and
the
sight
made
a
impression
on
the
mind
of
the
sensitive
boy
during
the
first
year
of
their
residence
in
ten
years
before
the
open
declaration
by
bahá
u
lláh
of
his
mission
the
keen
insight
of
abdu
who
was
then
but
nine
years
of
age
already
led
him
to
the
momentous
discovery
that
his
father
was
indeed
the
promised
one
whose
manifestation
all
the
bábís
were
awaiting
some
sixty
years
afterwards
he
thus
described
the
moment
in
which
this
conviction
suddenly
overwhelmed
his
whole
nature
i
am
the
servant
of
the
blessed
perfection
in
i
was
a
child
then
and
there
he
announced
to
me
the
word
and
i
believed
in
him
as
soon
as
he
proclaimed
to
me
the
word
i
threw
myself
at
his
holy
feet
and
implored
and
supplicated
him
to
accept
my
blood
as
a
sacrifice
in
his
pathway
sacrifice
how
sweet
i
find
that
word
there
is
no
greater
bounty
for
me
than
this
what
greater
glory
can
i
conceive
than
to
see

about
this
time
he
began
to
be
called
by
his
friends
the
mystery
of
god
a
title
given
to
him
by
bahá
u
lláh
by
which
he
was
commonly
known
during
the
period
of
residence
in
when
his
father
went
away
for
two
years
in
the
wilderness
abbás
was
heartbroken
his
chief
consolation
consisted
in
copying
and
committing
to
memory
the
tablets
of
the
báb
and
much
of
his
time
was
spent
in
solitary
meditation
when
at
last
his
father
returned
the
boy
was
overwhelmed
with
joy
youth
from
that
time
onwards
he
became
his
father
s
closest
companion
and
as
it
were
protector
although
a
mere
youth
he
already
showed
astonishing
sagacity
and
discrimination
and
undertook
the
task
of
interviewing
all
the
numerous
visitors
who
came
to
see
his
father
if
he
found
they
were
genuine
truth
seekers
he
admitted
them
to
his
father
s
presence
but
otherwise
he
did
not
permit
them
to
trouble
bahá
u
lláh
on
many
occasions
he
helped
his
father
in
answering
the
questions
and
solving
the
difficulties
of
these
visitors
for
example
when
of
the
súfí
leaders
named
alí
asked
for
an
explanation
of
the
phrase
i
was
a
hidden
mystery
which
occurs
in
a
muḥammadan
tradition
bahá
u
lláh
turned
to
the
mystery
of
god
abbás
and
asked
him
to
write
the
explanation
the
boy
who
was
then
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
of
age
at
once
wrote
an
important
epistle
giving
an
exposition
so
illuminating
as
to
astonish
the
this
epistle
is
now
widely
spread
among
the
bahá
ís
and
is
well
known
to
many
outside
the
bahá
í
faith
about
this
time
abbás
was
a
frequent
visitor
to
the
mosques
where
he
would
discuss
theological
matters
with
the
doctors
and
learned
men
he
never
attended
any
school
or
college
his
only
teacher
being
his
father
his
favorite
recreation
was
horseback
riding
which
he
keenly
enjoyed
after
bahá
u
lláh
s
declaration
in
the
garden
outside
abdu
s
devotion
to
his
father
became
greater
than
ever
on
the
long
journey
to
constantinople
he
guarded
bahá
u
lláh
night
and
day
riding
by
his
wagon
and
watching
near
his
tent
as
far
as
possible
he
relieved
his
father
of
all
domestic
cares
and
responsibilities
becoming
the
mainstay
and
comfort
of
the
entire
family
during
the
years
spent
in
adrianople
abdu
endeared
himself
to
everyone
he
taught
much
and
became
generally
known
as
the
at
akká
when
nearly
all
the
party
were
ill
with
typhoid
malaria
and
dysentery
he
washed
the
patients
nursed
them
fed
them
watched
with
them
taking
no
rest
until
utterly
exhausted
he
himself
took
dysentery
and
for
about
a
month
remained
in
a
dangerous
condition
in
akká
as
in
adrianople
all
classes
from
the
governor
to
the
most
wretched
beggar
learned
to
love
and
respect
him
marriage
the
following
particulars
regarding
the
marriage
of
abdu
were
kindly
supplied
to
the
writer
by
a
persian
historian
of
the
bahá
í
faith
during
the
youth
of
abdu
the
question
of
a
suitable
marriage
for
him
was
naturally
one
of
great
interest
to
the
believers
and
many
people
came
forward
wishing
to
have
this
crown
of
honor
for
their
own
family
for
a
long
time
however
abdu
showed
no
inclination
for
marriage
and
no
one
understood
the
wisdom
of
this
afterwards
it
became
known
that
there
was
a
girl
who
was
destined
to
become
the
wife
of
abdu
one
whose
birth
came
about
through
the
blessing
which
the
báb
gave
to
her
parents
in
iṣfáhán
her
father
was
mírzá
muḥammad
alí
who
was
the
uncle
of
the
king
of
martyrs
and
the
beloved
of
martyrs
and
she
belonged
to
one
of
the
great
and
noble
families
of
iṣfáhán
when
the
báb
was
in
iṣfáhán
mírzá
muḥammad
alí
had
no
children
but
his
wife
was
longing
for
a
child
on
hearing
of
this
the
báb
gave
him
a
portion
of
his
food
and
told
him
to
share
it
with
his
wife
after
they
had
eaten
of
that
food
it
soon
became
apparent
that
their
hopes
of
parenthood
were
about
to
be
fulfilled
and
in
due
course
a
daughter
was
born
to
them
who
was
given
the
name
of
munírih
later
on
son
was
born
to
whom
they
gave
the
name
of
siyyid
yaḥyá
and
afterwards
they
had
some
other
children
after
a
time
munírih
s
father
died
her
cousins
were
martyred
by
zillu
and
the
mullás
and
the
family
fell
into
great
troubles
and
bitter
persecutions
because
of
their
being
bahá
ís
bahá
u
lláh
then
permitted
munírih
and
her
brother
siyyid
yaḥyá
to
come
to
akká
for
protection
bahá
u
lláh
and
his
wife
navváb
the
mother
of
abdu
showed
such
kindness
and
favor
to
munírih
that
others
understood
that
they
wished
her
to
become
the
wife
of
abdu
the
wish
of
his
father
and
mother
became
the
wish
of
abdu
too
he
had
a
warm
feeling
of
love
and
affection
for
munírih
which
was
fully
reciprocated
and
erelong
they
became
united
in
marriage
the
marriage
proved
exceedingly
happy
and
harmonious
of
the
children
born
to
them
four
daughters
have
survived
the
rigors
of
their
long
imprisonment
and
through
their
beautiful
lives
of
service
have
endeared
themselves
to
all
who
have
been
privileged
to
know
them
center
of
the
covenant
bahá
u
lláh
indicated
in
many
ways
the
abdu
was
to
direct
the
cause
after
his
own
ascension
many
years
before
his
death
he
declared
this
in
a
veiled
manner
in
his
he
referred
to
abdu
on
many
occasions
as
the
center
of
my
covenant
the
most
great
branch
the
branch
from
the
ancient
he
habitually
spoke
of
him
as
the
master
and
required
all
his
family
to
treat
him
with
marked
deference
and
in
his
will
and
testament
he
left
explicit
instructions
that
all
should
turn
to
him
and
obey
him
after
the
death
of
the
blessed
beauty
as
bahá
u
lláh
was
generally
called
by
his
family
and
believers
abdu
assumed
the
position
which
his
father
had
clearly
indicated
for
him
as
head
of
the
cause
and
authoritative
interpreter
of
the
teachings
but
this
was
resented
by
certain
of
his
relatives
and
others
who
became
as
bitterly
opposed
to
abdu
as
had
been
to
bahá
u
lláh
they
tried
to
stir
up
dissensions
among
the
believers
and
failing
in
that
proceeded
to
make
various
false
charges
against
abdu
to
the
turkish
government
in
accordance
with
instructions
received
from
his
father
abdu
was
erecting
a
building
on
the
side
of
mount
carmel
above
haifa
which
was
intended
to
be
the
permanent
of
the
remains
of
the
báb
and
also
to
contain
a
number
of
rooms
for
meetings
and
services
they
represented
to
the
authorities
that
this
building
was
intended
as
a
fort
and
that
abdu
and
his
followers
meant
to
entrench
themselves
there
defy
the
government
and
endeavor
to
gain
possession
of
the
neighboring
region
of
syria
strict
imprisonment
renewed
in
consequence
of
this
and
other
equally
unfounded
charges
in
abdu
and
his
family
who
for
more
than
twenty
years
had
been
allowed
the
freedom
of
the
country
for
some
miles
around
akká
were
again
for
over
seven
years
strictly
confined
within
the
walls
of
the
prison
city
this
did
not
prevent
him
however
from
effectively
spreading
the
bahá
í
message
through
asia
europe
and
america
horace
holley
writes
of
this
period
as
follows
to
abdu
as
a
teacher
and
friend
came
men
and
women
from
every
race
religion
and
nation
to
sit
at
his
table
like
favored
guests
questioning
him
about
the
social
spiritual
or
moral
program
each
had
most
at
heart
and
after
a
stay
lasting
from
a
few
hours
to
many
months
returning
home
inspired
renewed
and
enlightened
the
world
surely
never
possessed
such
a
as
this
within
its
doors
the
rigid
castes
of
india
melted
away
the
racial
prejudice
of
jew
christian
and
muḥammadan
became
less
than
a
memory
and
every
convention
save
the
essential
law
of
warm
hearts
and
aspiring
minds
broke
down
banned
and
forbidden
by
the
unifying
sympathy
of
the
master
of
the
house
it
was
like
a
king
arthur
and
the
round
table
but
an
arthur
who
knighted
women
as
well
as
men
and
sent
them
away
not
with
the
sword
but
with
the
modern
social
religion
horace
holley
during
these
years
abdu
cared
on
an
enormous
correspondence
with
believers
and
inquirers
in
all
parts
of
the
world
in
this
work
he
was
greatly
assisted
by
his
daughters
and
also
by
several
interpreters
and
secretaries
much
of
his
time
was
spent
in
visiting
the
sick
and
the
afflicted
in
their
own
homes
and
in
the
poorest
quarters
of
akká
no
visitor
was
more
welcome
than
the
a
pilgrim
who
visited
akká
at
this
time
writes
it
is
the
custom
of
abdu
each
week
on
friday
morning
to
distribute
alms
to
the
poor
from
his
own
scanty
store
he
gives
a
little
to
each
one
of
the
needy
who
come
to
ask
assistance
this
morning
about
one
hundred
were
ranged
in
line
seated
and
crouching
upon
the
ground
in
the
open
street
of
the
courts
where
abdu
s
house
stands
and
such
a
nondescript
collection
of
humanity
they
were
all
kinds
of
men
women
and
wretched
hopeless
in
aspect
many
of
them
crippled
and
blind
beggars
indeed
poor
beyond
from
the
doorway
came
abdu
quickly
moving
from
one
to
another
stopping
sometimes
to
leave
a
word
of
sympathy
and
encouragement
dropping
small
coins
into
each
eager
outstretched
palm
touching
the
face
of
a
child
taking
the
hand
of
an
old
woman
who
held
fast
to
the
hem
of
his
garment
as
he
passed
along
speaking
words
of
light
to
old
men
with
sightless
eyes
inquiring
after
those
too
feeble
and
wretched
to
come
for
their
pittance
of
help
and
sending
them
their
portion
with
a
message
of
love
and
of
abdu
abdu
s
personal
wants
were
few
he
worked
late
and
early
two
simple
meals
a
day
sufficed
him
his
wardrobe
consisted
of
a
very
few
garments
of
inexpensive
material
he
could
not
bear
to
live
in
luxury
while
others
were
in
want
he
had
a
great
love
for
children
for
flowers
and
for
the
beauties
of
nature
every
morning
about
six
or
seven
the
family
party
used
to
gather
to
partake
of
the
morning
tea
together
and
while
the
master
sipped
his
tea
the
little
children
of
the
household
chanted
prayers
thornton
chase
writes
of
these
children
such
children
i
have
never
seen
so
courteous
unselfish
thoughtful
for
others
unobtrusive
intelligent
and
swiftly
in
the
little
things
that
children
love
galilee
the
ministry
of
flowers
was
a
feature
of
the
life
at
akká
of
which
every
pilgrim
brought
away
fragrant
memories
lucas
writes
when
the
master
inhales
the
odor
of
flowers
it
is
wonderful
to
see
him
it
seems
as
though
the
perfume
of
the
hyacinths
were
telling
him
something
as
he
buries
his
face
in
the
flowers
it
is
like
the
effort
of
the
ear
to
hear
a
beautiful
harmony
a
concentrated
attention
brief
account
of
my
visit
to
akká
pp
he
loved
to
present
beautiful
and
flowers
to
his
numerous
visitors
thornton
chase
sums
up
his
impression
of
the
prison
life
at
akká
as
follows
five
days
we
remained
within
those
walls
prisoners
with
him
who
dwells
in
that
greatest
it
is
a
prison
of
peace
of
love
and
service
no
wish
no
desire
is
there
save
the
good
of
mankind
the
peace
of
the
world
the
acknowledgement
of
the
fatherhood
of
god
and
the
mutual
rights
of
men
as
his
creatures
his
children
indeed
the
real
prison
the
suffocating
atmosphere
the
separation
from
all
true
heart
desires
the
bond
of
world
conditions
is
outside
of
those
stone
walls
while
within
them
is
the
freedom
and
pure
aura
of
the
spirit
of
god
all
troubles
tumults
worries
or
anxieties
for
worldly
things
are
barred
out
galilee
to
most
people
the
hardships
of
prison
life
would
appear
as
grievous
calamities
but
for
abdu
they
had
no
terrors
when
in
prison
he
wrote
grieve
not
because
of
my
imprisonment
and
calamity
for
this
prison
is
my
beautiful
garden
my
mansioned
paradise
and
my
throne
of
dominion
among
mankind
my
calamity
in
my
prison
is
a
crown
to
me
in
which
i
glory
among
the
righteous
anyone
can
be
happy
in
the
state
of
comfort
ease
health
success
pleasure
and
joy
but
if
one
be
happy
and
contented
in
the
time
of
trouble
hardship
and
prevailing
disease
that
is
the
proof
of
nobility
turkish
commissions
of
investigation
in
and
commissions
were
appointed
by
the
turkish
government
to
inquire
into
the
charges
against
abdu
and
lying
witnesses
gave
evidence
against
him
abdu
while
refuting
the
charges
expressed
his
entire
readiness
to
submit
to
any
sentence
the
tribunal
chose
to
impose
he
declared
that
if
they
should
throw
him
into
jail
drag
him
through
the
streets
curse
him
spit
upon
him
stone
him
heap
upon
him
all
sort
of
ignominy
hang
him
or
shoot
him
he
would
still
be
happy
between
the
sittings
of
the
commissions
of
investigation
he
pursued
his
ordinary
life
with
the
utmost
serenity
planting
fruit
trees
in
a
garden
and
presiding
at
a
marriage
feast
with
the
dignity
and
radiance
of
spiritual
freedom
the
spanish
consul
offered
to
provide
him
a
safe
passage
to
any
foreign
port
he
cared
to
select
but
this
offer
he
gratefully
but
firmly
refused
saying
that
whatever
the
consequences
he
must
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
the
báb
and
the
blessed
perfection
who
never
tried
to
save
themselves
or
run
away
from
their
enemies
he
encouraged
most
of
the
bahá
ís
however
to
leave
the
neighborhood
of
akká
which
had
become
very
dangerous
for
them
and
remained
alone
with
a
few
of
the
faithful
to
await
his
destiny
the
four
corrupt
officials
who
constituted
the
last
investigating
commission
arrived
in
akká
in
the
early
part
of
the
winter
of
stayed
one
month
and
departed
for
constantinople
after
finishing
their
investigation
prepared
to
report
that
the
charges
against
abdu
had
been
substantiated
and
to
recommend
his
exile
or
execution
no
sooner
had
they
got
back
to
turkey
however
than
the
revolution
broke
out
there
and
the
four
commissioners
who
belonged
to
the
old
regime
had
to
flee
for
their
lives
the
young
turks
established
their

abdu
continued
the
same
holy
life
of
ceaseless
activity
in
teaching
correspondence
ministering
to
the
poor
and
the
sick
with
merely
the
change
from
akká
to
haifa
and
from
haifa
to
alexandria
until
august
when
he
started
on
his
first
visit
to
the
western
world
during
his
tours
in
the
west
abdu
met
men
of
every
shade
of
opinion
and
amply
fulfilled
the
command
of
bahá
u
lláh
to
consort
with
all
the
people
with
joy
and
he
reached
london
early
in
september
and
spent
a
month
there
during
which
besides
daily
talks
with
inquirers
and
many
other
activities

returned
to

in
these
strenuous
western

physical

wrote
the
following
pathetic
tablet
to
the
believers
in

and
west
friends
the
time
is
coming
when
i
shall
be
no

with
you

have
done
all
that
could
be
done
i
have
served
the
cause
of
bahá
u
lláh
to
the
utmost
of
my
ability
i
have
labored
night
and
day
all
the
years
of
my
life
oh
how
i
long
to
see
the
believers
shouldering
the
responsibilities
of
the
cause
now
is
the
time
to
proclaim
the
kingdom
of
abhá
the
most
glorious
now
is
the
hour
of
union
and
concord
now
is
the
day
of
the
spiritual
harmony
of
the
friends
of
god
i
am
straining
my
ears
toward
the
east
and
toward
the
west
toward
the
north
and
toward
the
south
that
haply
i
may
hear
the
songs
of
love
and
fellowship
raised
in
the
meetings
of
the
believers
my
days
are
numbered
and
save
this
there
remains
none
other
joy
for
me
oh
how
i
yearn
to
see
the
friends
united
even
as
a
shining
strand
of
pearls
as
the
brilliant
pleiades
as
the
rays
of
the
sun
the
gazelles
of
one
meadow
the
mystic
nightingale
is
singing
for
them
will
they
not
listen
the
bird
of
paradise
is
warbling
will
they
not
hear
the
angel
of
the
kingdom
of
abhá
is
calling
to
them
will
they
not
hearken
the
messenger
of
the
covenant
is
pleading
will
they
not
heed
ah
i
am
waiting
waiting
to
hear
the
glad
news
that
the
believers
are
the
embodiment
of
sincerity
and
loyalty
the
incarnation
of
love
and
amity
and
the
manifestation
of
unity
and
concord
will
they
not
rejoice
my
heart
will
they
not
satisfy
my
yearnings
will
they
not
heed
my
pleadings
will
they
not
fulfill
my
hopes
will
they
not
answer
my
call
i
am
waiting
i
am
patiently
waiting
the
enemies
of
the
bahá
í
cause
whose
hopes
had
risen
high
when
the
báb
fell
a
victim
to
their
fury
when
bahá
u
lláh
was
driven
from
his
native
land
and
made
a
prisoner
for
life
and
again
at
the
passing
of
bahá
u
enemies
once
more
took
heart
when
they
saw
the
physical
weakness
and
weariness
of
abdu
after
his
return
from
his
western
travels
but
again
their
hopes
were
doomed
to
disappointment
in
a
short
time
abdu
was
able
to
write
unquestionably
this
physical
body
and
human
energy
would
have
been
unable
to
stand
the
constant
wear
and
tear
but
the
aid
and
help
of
the
desired
one
were
the
guardian
and
protector
of
the
weak
and
humble
abdu
some
have
asserted
that
abdu
is
on
the
eve
of
bidding
his
last
farewell
to
the
world
that
his
physical
energies
are
depleted
and
drained
and
that
ere
long
these
complications
will
put
an
end
to
his
life
this
is
far
from
the
truth
although
in
the
outward
estimation
of
the
and
the
body
is
weak
on
account
of
ordeals
in
the
blessed
path
yet
praise
be
to
god
through
the
providence
of
the
blessed
perfection
the
spiritual
forces
are
in
the
utmost
rejuvenation
and
strength
thanks
be
to
god
that
now
through
the
blessing
and
benediction
of
bahá
u
lláh
even
the
physical
energies
are
fully
restored
divine
joy
is
obtained
the
supreme
are
resplendent
and
ideal
happiness
overflowing
both
during
the
european
war
and
after
its
close
abdu
amidst
countless
other
activities
was
able
to
pour
forth
a
series
of
great
and
inspiring
letters
which
when
communications
were
reopened
roused
believers
throughout
the
world
to
new
enthusiasm
and
zeal
for
service
under
the
inspiration
of
these
letters
the
cause
progressed
by
leaps
and
bounds
and
everywhere
the
faith
showed
signs
of
new
vitality
and
vigor
war
time
at
haifa
a
remarkable
instance
of
the
foresight
of
abdu
was
supplied
during
the
months
immediately
preceding
the
war
during
peacetimes
there
was
usually
a
large
number
of
pilgrims
at
haifa
from
persia
and
other
regions
of
the
globe
about
six
months
before
the
outbreak
of
war
one
of
the
old
bahá
ís
living
at
haifa
present
a
request
from
several
believers
of
persia
for
permission
to
visit
the
master
abdu
did
not
grant
the
permission
and
from
that
time
onwards
gradually
dismissed
the
pilgrims
who
were
at
haifa
so
that
by
the
end
of
july
none
remained
when
in
the
first
days
of
august
the
sudden
outbreak
of
the
great
war
startled
the
world
the
wisdom
of
his
precaution
became
apparent
when
the
war
broke
out
abdu
who
had
already
spent
years
of
his
life
in
exile
and
prison
became
again
virtually
a
prisoner
of
the
turkish
government
communication
with
friends
and
believers
outside
syria
was
almost
completely
cut
off
and
he
and
his
little
band
of
followers
were
again
subjected
to
straitened
circumstances
scarcity
of
food
and
great
personal
danger
and
inconvenience
during
the
war
abdu
had
a
busy
time
in
ministering
to
the
material
and
spiritual
wants
of
the
people
about
him
he
personally
organized
extensive
agricultural
operations
near
tiberias
thus
securing
a
great
supply
of
wheat
by
means
of
which
famine
was
averted
not
only
for
the
bahá
ís
but
for
hundreds
of
the
poor
of
all
religions
in
haifa
and
akká
whose
wants
he
liberally
supplied
he
took
care
of
all
and
mitigated
their
sufferings
as
far
as
possible
to
hundreds
of
poor
people
he
would
give
a
small
sum
of
money
daily
in
addition
to
money
he
gave
bread
if
there
was
no
bread
he
would
give
dates
or
something
else
he
made
frequent
visits
to
akká
to
comfort
and
help
the
believers
and
poor
people
there
during
the
time
of
war
he
had
daily
meetings
of
the
believers
and
through
his
help
the
friends
remained
happy
and
tranquil
throughout
those
troublous
years
sir
abdu
abbás
great
was
the
rejoicing
in
haifa
when
on
the
day
of
september
at
after
some
hours
fighting
the
city
was
taken
by
british
and
indian
cavalry
and
the
horrors
of
war
conditions
under
the
turkish
rule
came
to
an
end
from
the
beginning
of
the
british
occupation
large
numbers
of
soldiers
and
government
officials
of
all
ranks
even
the
highest
sought
interviews
with
abdu
delighting
in
his
illuminating
talks
his
breadth
of
view
and
depth
of
insight
his
dignified
courtesy
and
genial
hospitality
so
profoundly
impressed
were
the
government
representatives
by
his
noble
character
and
his
great
work
in
the
interests
of
peace
conciliation
and
the
true
prosperity
of
the
people
that
a
knighthood
of
the
british
empire
was
conferred
on
abdu
the
ceremony
taking
place
in
the
garden
of
the
military
governor
of
haifa
on
the
day
of
april
last
years
during
the
winter
of
the
writer
had
the
great
privilege
of
spending
two
and
half
months
as
the
guest
of
abdu
at
haifa
and
intimately
observing
his
daily
life
at
that
time
although
nearly
years
of
age
he
was
still
remarkably
vigorous
and
accomplished
daily
an
almost
incredible
amount
of
work
although
often
very
weary
he
showed
wonderful
powers
of
recuperation
and
his
services
were
always
at
the
disposal
of
those
who
needed
them
most
his
unfailing
patience
gentleness
kindliness
and
tact
made
his
presence
like
a
benediction
it
was
his
custom
to
spend
a
large
part
of
each
night
in
prayer
and
meditation
from
early
morning
until
evening
except
for
a
short
siesta
after
lunch
he
was
busily
engaged
in
reading
and
answering
letters
from
many
lands
and
in
attending
to
the
multitudinous
affairs
of
the
household
and
of
the
cause
in
the
afternoon
he
usually
had
a
little
relaxation
in
the
form
of
a
walk
or
a
drive
but
even
then
he
was
usually
accompanied
by
one
or
two
or
a
party
of
pilgrims
with
whom
he
would
converse
on
spiritual
matters
or
he
would
find
opportunity
by
the
way
of
seeing
and
ministering
to
some
of
the
poor
after
his
return
he
would
call
the
friends
to
the
usual
evening
meeting
in
his
salon
both
at
lunch
and
supper
he
used
to
entertain
a
number
of
pilgrims
and
friends
and
charm
his
guests
with
happy
and
humorous
stories
as
well
as
precious
talks
on
a
great
variety
of
subjects
my
home
is
the
home
of
laughter
and
mirth
he
declared
and
indeed
it
was
so
he
delighted
in
gathering
together
people
of
various
races
colors
nations
and
religions
in
unity
and
cordial
friendship
around
his
hospitable
board
he
was
indeed
a
loving
father
not
only
to
the
little
community
at
haifa
but
to
the
bahá
í
community
throughout
the
world
the
passing
of
abdu
abdu
s
manifold
activities
continued
with
little
abatement
despite
increasing
bodily
weakness
and
weariness
up
till
the
last
day
or
two
of
his
life
on
friday
november
he
attended
the
noonday
prayer
at
the
mosque
in
haifa
and
afterwards
distributed
alms
to
the
poor
with
his
own
hands
as
was
his
wont
after
lunch
he
dictated
some
letters
when
he
had
rested
he
walked
in
the
garden
and
had
a
talk
with
the
gardener
in
the
evening
he
gave
his
blessing
and
counsel
to
a
loved
and
faithful
servant
of
the
household
who
had
been
married
that
day
and
afterwards
he
attended
the
usual
meeting
of
the
friends
in
his
own
salon
less
that
three
days
later
about
on
monday
november
he
passed
away
so
peacefully
that
to
the
two
daughters
watching
by
his
bedside
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
gone
quietly
to
sleep
the
sad
news
soon
spread
throughout
the
town
and
was
flashed
over
the
wires
to
all
parts
of
the
world
the
next
morning
tuesday
november
the
funeral
took
place
a
funeral
the
like
of
which
haifa
nay
palestine
itself
had
surely
never
seen
so
deep
was
the
feeling
that
brought
so
many
thousands
of
mourners
together
representative
of
so
many
religions
races
and
tongues
the
high

both

degree
all
about
ten
thousand
in

mourning
the

of
their

with
one
accord

our
father
has
left

they
slowly
wended
their
way
up
mount
carmel
the
vineyard
of
god
after
two
hours
walking
they
reached
the
garden
of
the
tomb
of
the
báb
as
the
vast
concourse
pressed
round
representatives
of
the
various
denominations
moslems
christians
and
jews
all
hearts
being
ablaze
with
fervent
love
of
abdu
some
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
other
prepared
raised
their
voices
in
eulogy
and
regret
paying
their
last
homage
of
farewell
to
their
loved
one
so
united
were
they
in
their
acclamation
of
him
as
the
wise
educator
and
reconciler
of
the
human
race
in
this
perplexed
and
sorrowful
age
that
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
left
for
the
bahá
ís
to
passing
of
abdu
by
lady
blomfield
and
shoghi
effendi
pp
nine
speakers
all
of
them
prominent
representatives
of
the
muslim
christian
and
jewish
communities
bore
eloquent
and
moving
witness
to
their
love
and
admiration
of
the
pure
and
noble
life
which
had
just
drawn
to
its
close
then
the
casket
was
slowly
passed
to
its
simple
and
hallowed
surely
here
was
a
fitting
tribute
to
the
memory
of
one
who
had
labored
all
his
life
for
unity
of
religions
of
races
of
tribute
and
also
a
proof
that
his
lifework
had
not
been
in
vain
that
the
ideals
of
bahá
u
lláh
which
were
his
inspiration
nay
his
very
life
were
already
beginning
to
permeate
the
world
and
to
break
down
the
barriers
of
sect
and
caste
that
for
centuries
had
alienated
muslim
christian
jew
and
the
other
diverse
factions
into
which
the
human
family
has
been
riven
writings
and
addresses
the
writings
of
abdu
are
very
numerous
and
are
mostly
in
the
form
of
letter
to
believers
and
inquirers
a
great
many
of
his
talks
and
addresses
have
also
been
recorded
and
many
have
been
published
of
the
thousands
of
pilgrims
who
have
visited
him
at
akká
and
haifa
a
large
number
have
written
descriptions
of
their
impressions
and
many
of
these
records
are
now
available
in
printed
form
his
teachings
are
thus
very
completely
preserved
and
they
cover
a
very
wide
range
of
subjects
with
many
of
the
problems
of
both
east
and
west
he
dealt
more
fully
than
his
father
had
done
giving
more
detailed
applications
of
the
general
principles
laid
down
by
bahá
u
lláh
a
number
of
his
writings
have
not
yet
been
translated
into
any
western
language
but
enough
is
already
available
to
give
deep
and
full
knowledge
of
the
more
important
principles
of
his
teaching
he
spoke
persian
arabic
and
turkish
in
his
western
tours
his
talks
and
addresses
were
always
interpreted
obviously
losing
much
of
their
beauty
eloquence
and
force
in
the
process
yet
such
was
the
power
of
the
spirit
which
accompanied
his
words
that
all
who
heard
him
were
impressed
station
of
abdu
the
unique
station
assigned
to
abdu
by
the
blessed
perfection
is
indicated
in
the
following
passage
written
by
the
latter
when
the
ocean
of
my
presence
hath
ebbed
and
the
book
of
my
revelation
is
ended
turn
your
faces
towards
him
whom
god
hath
purposed
who
hath
branched
from
this
ancient
and
again
refer
ye
whatsoever
ye
understand
not
in
the
book
to
him
who
hath
branched
from
this
mighty
abdu
himself
wrote
the
following
in
accordance
with
the
explicit
text
of
the
bahá
u
lláh
hath
made
the
center
of
the
covenant
the
interpreter
of
his
covenant
so
firm
and
mighty
that
from
the
beginning
of
time
until
the
present
day
no
religious
dispensation
hath
produced
its
the
very
completeness
of
the
servitude
with
which
abdu
promulgated
the
faith
of
bahá
u
lláh
in
east
and
west
resulted
at
times
in
a
confusion
of
belief
concerning
his
station
on
the
part
of
believers
realizing
the
purity
of
the
spirit
animating
his
word
and
deed
surrounded
by
religious
influences
marking
the
breakdown
of
their
traditional
doctrines
a
number
of
bahá
ís
felt
that
they
honored
abdu
by
likening
him
to
a
manifestation
or
hailing
him
as
the
return
of
nothing
caused
him
such
intense
grief
as
this
failure
to
perceive
that
his
capacity
to
serve
bahá
u
lláh
proceeded
from
the
purity
of
the
mirror
turned
to
the
sun
of
truth
and
not
from
the
sun
itself
moreover
unlike
previous
dispensations
the
faith
of
bahá
u
lláh
had
within
it
the
potency
of
a
universal
human
society
during
abdu
s
mission
covering
the
period
to
the
faith
evolved
through
successive
stages
of
development
in
the
direction
of
a
true
world
order
its
development
required
continuous
direction
and
specific
instruction
from
abdu
who
alone
knew
the
fullness
of
that
new
potent
inspiration
brought
to
earth
in
this
age
until
his
own
will
and
testament
was
revealed
after
abdu
s
departure
from
the
flesh
and
its
significance
was
expounded
by
shoghi
effendi
the
guardian
of
the
faith
the
bahá
ís
almost
inevitably
attributed
their
beloved
master
s
guidance
a
degree
of
spiritual
authority
equaling
that
of
the
manifestation
the
effects
of
such
naive
enthusiasm
are
no
longer
felt
within
the
bahá
í
community
but
with
a
sounder
realization
of
the
mystery
of
that
incomparably
devotion
and
servitude
the
bahá
ís
can
today
all
the
more
consciously
appreciate
the
unique
character
of
the
mission
which
abdu
fulfilled
the
faith
which
in
seemed
so
weak
and
helpless
in
the
physical
exile
and
imprisonment
of
its
exemplar
and
interpreter
has
since
with
irresistible
power
raised
up
communities
in
many
countries
and
challenges
the
weakness
of
a
decaying
civilization
with
a
body
of
teachings
that
alone
reveal
the
future
of
a
despairing
humanity
the
will
and
testament
of
abdu
itself
set
forth
with
complete
clarity
the
mystery
of
the
stations
of
the
báb
and
of
bahá
u
lláh
and
his
own
mission
this
is
the
foundation
of
the
belief
of
the
people
of
bahá
may
my
life
be
offered
up
for
them
his
holiness
the
exalted
one
the
báb
is
the
manifestation
of
the
unity
and
oneness
of
god
and
the
forerunner
of
the
ancient
beauty
his
holiness
the
abhá
beauty
may
my
life
be
a
sacrifice
for
his
steadfast
friends
is
the
supreme
manifestation
of
god
and
the
dayspring
of
his
most
divine
essence
all
others
are
servants
unto
him
and
do
his
by
this
statement
and
by
numerous
others
in
which
abdu
emphasized
the
importance
of
basing
one
s
knowledge
of
the
faith
upon
his
general
tablets
a
foundation
for
unity
of
belief
was
established
with
the
result
that
the
differences
of
understanding
caused
by
reference
to
his
tablets
to
individuals
in
which
the
master
answered
personal
questions
rapidly
disappeared
above
all
the
establishment
of
a
definite
administrative
order
with
the
guardian
at
its
head
transferred
to
institutions
all
authority
previously
wielded
in
the
form
of
prestige
and
influence
by
individual
bahá
ís
in
the
various
local
groups
exemplar
of
bahá
í
life
bahá
u
lláh
was
preeminently
the
revealer
of
the
word
his
forty
years
imprisonment
gave
him
but
limited
opportunities
of
intercourse
with
his
fellowmen
to
abdu
therefore
fell
the
important
task
of
becoming
the
exponent
of
the
revelation
the
doer
of
the
word
the
great
exemplar
of
the
bahá
í
life
in
actual
contact
with
the
world
of
today
in
the
most
diverse
phases
of
its
myriad
activities
he
showed
that
it
is
still
possible
amid
the
whirl
and
rush
of
modern
life
amid
the
and
struggle
for
material
prosperity
that
everywhere
prevail
to
live
the
life
of
entire
devotion
to
god
and
to
the
service
of
one
s
fellows
which
christ
and
bahá
u
lláh
and
all
the
prophets
have
demanded
of
men
through
trial
and
vicissitudes
calumnies
and
treachery
on
the
one
hand
and
through
love
and
praise
devotion
and
veneration
on
the
other
he
stood
like
a
lighthouse
founded
on
a
rock
around
which
wintry
tempests
rage
and
the
summer
ocean
plays
his
poise
and
serenity
remaining
ever
steadfast
and
unshaken
he
lived
the
life
of
faith
and
calls
on
his
followers
to
live
it
here
and
now
he
raised
amid
a
warring
world
the
banner
of
unity
and
peace
the
standard
of
a
new
era
and
he
assures
those
who
rally
to
its
support
that
they
shall
be
inspired
by
the
spirit
of
the
new
day
it
is
the
same
holy
spirit
which
inspired
the
prophets
and
saints
of
old
but
it
is
a
new
outpouring
of
that
spirit
suited
to
the
needs
of
the
new
time
chapter
what

í

must
show
forth
fruits
a
fruitless
man
in
the
words
of
his
holiness
the

christ
is
like
a
fruitless

and
a
fruitless

herbert

once
remarked
that
by
no
political
alchemy
is
it
possible
to
get
golden
conduct
out
of
leaden
instincts
and
it
is
equally
true
that
by
no
political
alchemy
is
it
possible
to
make
a
golden
society
out
of
leaden
individuals
bahá
u
lláh
like
all
previous
prophets
proclaimed
this
truth
and
taught
that
in
order
to
establish
the
kingdom
of
god
in
the
world
it
must
first
be
established
in
the
hearts
of
men
in
examining
the
bahá
í
teachings
therefore
we
shall
commence
with
the
instructions
of
bahá
u
lláh
for
individual
conduct
and
try
to
form
a
clear
picture
of
what
it
means
to
be
a
bahá
í
living
the
life
when
asked
on
one
occasion
what
is
a
bahá
í
abdu
replied
to
be
a
bahá
í
simply
means
to
love
all
the
world
to
love
humanity
and
try
to
serve
it
to
work
for
universal
peace
and
universal
on
another
occasion
he
defined
a
bahá
í
as
one
endowed
with
all
the
perfections
of
man
in
in
one
of
his
london
talks
he
said
that
a
man
may
be
a
bahá
í
even
if
he
has
never
heard
the
name
of
bahá
u
lláh
he
added
the
man
who
lives
the
life
according
to
the
teachings
of
bahá
u
lláh
is
already
a
bahá
í
on
the
other
hand
a
man
may
call
himself
a
bahá
í
for
fifty
years
and
if
he
does
not
live
the
life
he
is
not
a
bahá
í
an
ugly
man
may
call
himself
handsome
but
he
deceives
no
one
and
a
black
man
may
call
himself
white
yet
he
deceives
no
one
not
even
himself
one
who
does
not
know
god
s
messengers
however
is
like
a
plant
growing
in
the
shade
although
it
knows
not
the
sun
it
is
nevertheless
absolutely
dependent
on
it
the
great
prophets
are
spirits
suns
and
bahá
u
lláh
is
the
sun
of
this
day
in
which
we
live
the
suns
of
former
days
have
warmed
and
vivified
the
world
and
had
those
suns
not
shone
the
earth
would
not
be
cold
and
dead
but
it
is
the
sunshine
of
today
that
alone
can
ripen
the
fruits
which
the
suns
of
former
days
have
kissed
into
life
devotion
to
god
in
order
to
attain
to
the
bahá
í
life
in
all
its
fullness
conscious
and
direct
relations
with
bahá
u
lláh
are
as
necessary
as
is
sunshine
for
the
unfolding
of
the
lily
or
the
rose
the
bahá
í
worships
not
the
human
personality
of
bahá
u
lláh
but
the
glory
of
god
manifest
through
that
personality
he
reverences
christ
and
muḥammad
and
all
god
s
former
messengers
to
mankind
but
he
recognizes
bahá
u
lláh
as
the
bearer
of
god
s
message
for
the
new
age
in
which
we
live
as
the
great
world
teacher
who
has
come
to
carry
on
and
consummate
the
work
of
his
predecessors
intellectual
assent
to
a
creed
does
not
make
a
man
a
bahá
í
nor
does
outward
rectitude
of
conduct
bahá
u
lláh
requires
of
his
followers
wholehearted
and
complete
devotion
god
alone
has
the
right
to
make
such
a
demand
but
bahá
u
lláh
speaks
as
the
manifestation
of
god
and
the
revealer
of
his
will
previous
manifestations
have
been
equally
clear
on
this
point
christ
said
if
any
man
come
after
me
let
him
deny
himself
and
take
up
his
cross
daily
and
follow
me
for
whosoever
will
save
his
life
shall
lose
it
but
whosoever
will
lose
his
life
for
my
sake
the
same
shall
save
in
different
words
all
the
divine
manifestations
have
made
this
same
demand
from
their
followers
and
the
history
of
religion
shows
clearly
that
as
long
as
the
demand
has
been
frankly
recognized
and
accepted
religion
has
flourished
despite
all
earthly
opposition
despite
affliction
persecution
and
martyrdom
of
the
believers
on
the
other
hand
whenever
compromise
has
crept
in
and
respectability
has
taken
the
place
of
complete
consecration
then
religion
has
decayed
it
has
become
fashionable
but
it
has
lost
its
power
to
save
and
transform
its
power
to
work
miracles
true
religion
has
never
yet
been
fashionable
god
grant
that
one
day
it
may
become
so
but
it
is
still
true
as
in
the
days
of
christ
that
strait
is
the
gate
and
narrow
is
the
way
which
leadeth
unto
life
and
few
there
be
that
find
the
gateway
of
spiritual
birth
like
the
gateway
of
natural
birth
admits
men
only
one
by
one
and
without
encumbrances
if
in
the
future
more
people
succeed
in
entering
that
way
than
in
the
past
it
will
not
be
because
of
any
widening
of
the
gate
but
because
of
a
greater
disposition
on
the
part
of
men
to
make
the
great
surrender
which
god
demands
because
long
and
bitter
experience
has
at
last
brought
them
to
see
the
folly
of
choosing
their
own
way
instead
of
god
s
way
search
after
truth
bahá
u
lláh
enjoins
justice
on
all
his
followers
and
defines
it
as
the
freedom
of
man
from
superstition
and
imitation
so
that
he
may
discern
the
manifestations
of
god
with
the
eyes
of
oneness
and
consider
all
affairs
with
keen
of
wisdom
it
is
necessary
that
each
individual
should
see
and
realize
for
himself
the
glory
of
god
manifest
in
the
human
temple
of
bahá
u
lláh
otherwise
the
bahá
í
faith
would
be
for
him
but
a
name
without
meaning
the
call
of
the
prophets
to
mankind
has
always
been
that
men
should
open
their
eyes
not
shut
them
use
their
reason
not
suppress
it
it
is
clear
seeing
and
free
thinking
not
servile
credulity
that
will
enable
them
to
penetrate
the
clouds
of
prejudice
to
shake
off
the
fetters
of
blind
imitation
and
attain
to
the
realization
of
the
truth
of
a
new
revelation
he
who
would
be
a
bahá
í
needs
to
be
a
fearless
seeker
after
truth
but
he
should
not
confine
his
search
to
the
material
plane
his
spiritual
perceptive
powers
should
be
awake
as
well
as
his
physical
he
should
use
all
the
faculties
god
has
given
him
for
the
acquisition
of
truth
believing
nothing
without
valid
and
sufficient
reason
if
his
heart
is
pure
and
his
mind
free
from
prejudice
the
earnest
seeker
will
not
fail
to
recognize
the
divine
glory
in
whatsoever
temple
it
may
become
manifest
bahá
u
lláh
further
declares
man
should
know
his
own
self
and
know
those
things
that
lead
to
loftiness
or
to
baseness
to
shame
or
to
honor
to
wealth
or
to
of
tarazát
the
source
of
all
learning
is
the
knowledge
of
god
exalted
be
his
glory
and
this
can
not
be
attained
save
through
the
knowledge
of
his
divine
of
wisdom
the
manifestation
is
the
perfect
man
the
great
exemplar
for
mankind
the
first
fruit
of
the
tree
of
humanity
until
we
know
him
we
do
not
know
the
latent
possibilities
within
ourselves
christ
tells
us
to
consider
the
lilies
how
they
grow
and
declares
that
solomon
in
all
his
glory
was
not
arrayed
like
one
of
these
the
lily
grows
from
a
very
bulb
if
we
had
never
seen
a
lily
in
bloom
never
gazed
on
its
matchless
grace
of
foliage
and
flower
how
could
we
know
the
reality
contained
in
that
bulb
we
might
dissect
it
most
carefully
and
examine
it
most
minutely
but
we
should
never
discover
the
dormant
beauty
which
the
gardener
knows
how
to
awaken
so
until
we
have
seen
the
glory
of
god
revealed
in
the
manifestation
we
can
have
no
idea
of
the
spiritual
beauty
latent
in
our
own
nature
and
in
that
of
our
fellows
by
knowing
and
loving
the
manifestation
of
god
and
following
his
teachings
we
are
enabled
little
by
little
to
realize
the
potential
perfections
within
ourselves
then
and
not
till
then
does
the
meaning
and
purpose
of
life
and
of
the
universe
become
apparent
to
us
love
of
god
to
know
the
manifestation
of
god
means
also
to
love
him
one
is
impossible
without
the
other
according
to
bahá
u
lláh
the
purpose
of
man
s
creation
is
that
he
may
know
god
and
adore
him
he
says
in
one
of
his
tablets
the
cause
of
the
creation
of
all
contingent
beings
has
been
love
as
it
is
said
in
the
tradition
i
was
a
hidden
treasure
and
i
loved
to
be
known
therefore
i
created
the
creation
in
order
to
be
and
in
the
hidden
words
he
says
o
son
of
being
love
me
that
i
may
love
thee
if
thou
lovest
me
not
my
love
can
in
no
wise
reach
thee
know
this
o
servant
o
son
of
the
wondrous
vision
i
have
breathed
within
thee
a
breath
of
my
own
spirit
that
thou
mayest
be
my
lover
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
and
sought
a
beloved
other
than
me
to
be
god
s
lover
that
is
the
sole
object
of
life
for
the
bahá
í
to
have
god
as
his
closest
companion
and
most
intimate
friend
his
peerless
beloved
in
whose
presence
is
fullness
of
joy
and
to
love
god
means
to
love
everything
and
everybody
for
all
are
of
god
the
real
bahá
í
will
be
the
perfect
lover
he
will
love
everyone
with
a
pure
heart
fervently
he
will
hate
no
one
he
will
despise
no
one
for
he
will
have
learned
to
see
the
face
of
the
beloved
in
every
face
and
to
find
his
traces
everywhere
his
love
will
know
no
limit
of
sect
nation
class
or
race
bahá
u
lláh
says
of
old
it
hath
been
revealed
love
of
one
s
country
is
an
element
of
the
faith
of
the
tongue
of
grandeur
hath
in
the
day
of
his
manifestation
proclaimed
it
is
not
his
to
boast
who
loveth
his
country
but
it
is
his
who
loveth
the
of
the
world
and
again
blessed
is
he
who
prefers
his
brother
before
himself
such
an
one
is
of
the
people
of
of
paradise
abdu
tells
us
we
must
be
as
one
soul
in
many
bodies
for
the
more
we
love
each
other
the
nearer
we
shall
be
to
to
an
american
audience
he
said
likewise
the
divine
religions
of
the
holy
manifestations
of
god
are
in
reality
one
though
in
name
and
nomenclature
they
differ
man
must
be
a
lover
of
the
light
no
matter
from
what
it
may
appear
he
must
be
a
lover
of
the
rose
no
matter
what
soil
it
may
be
growing
he
must
be
a
seeker
of
the
truth
no
matter
from
what
source
it
come
attachment
to
the
lantern
is
not
loving
the
light
attachment
to
the
earth
is
not
befitting
but
enjoyment
of
the
rose
which
develops
from
the
soil
is
worthy
devotion
to
the
tree
is
profitless
but
partaking
of
the
fruit
is
beneficial
luscious
fruits
no
matter
upon
what
tree
they
grow
or
where
they
may
be
found
must
be
enjoyed
the
word
of
truth
no
matter
which
tongue
utters
it
must
be
sanctioned
absolute
verities
no
matter
in
what
book
they
be
recorded
must
be
accepted
if
we
harbor
prejudice
it
will
be
the
cause
of
deprivation
and
ignorance
the
strife
between
religions
nations
and
races
arises
from
misunderstanding
if
we
investigate
the
religions
to
discover
the
principles
underlying
their
foundations
we
will
find
they
agree
for
the
fundamental
reality
of
them
is
one
and
not
multiple
by
this
means
the
religionists
of
the
world
will
reach
their
point
of
unity
and
reconciliation
again
he
says
every
soul
of
the
beloved
ones
must
love
the
others
and
withhold
not
his
possessions
and
life
from
them
and
by
all
means
he
must
endeavor
to
make
the
other
joyous
and
happy
but
these
others
must
also
be
disinterested
and
thus
may
this
sunrise
flood
the
horizons
this
melody
gladden
and
make
happy
all
the
people
this
divine
remedy
become
the
panacea
for
every
disease
this
spirit
of
truth
become
the
cause
of
life
for
every
soul
severance
devotion
to
god
implies
also
severance
from
everything
that
is
not
of
god
severance
that
is
from
all
selfish
and
worldly
and
ever
desires
the
path
of
god
may
lie
through
riches
or
poverty
health
or
sickness
through
palace
or
dungeon
rose
garden
or
torture
chamber
whichever
it
be
the
bahá
í
will
learn
to
accept
his
lot
with
radiant
severance
does
not
mean
stolid
indifference
to
one
s
surroundings
or
passive
resignation
to
evil
conditions
nor
does
it
mean
despising
the
good
things
which
god
has
created
the
true
bahá
í
will
not
be
callous
nor
apathetic
nor
ascetic
he
will
find
abundant
interest
abundant
work
and
abundant
joy
in
the
path
of
god
but
he
will
not
deviate
one
hair
s
breadth
from
that
path
in
pursuit
of
pleasure
nor
hanker
after
anything
that
god
has
denied
him
when
a
man
becomes
a
bahá
í
god
s
will
becomes
his
will
for
to
be
at
variance
with
god
is
the
one
thing
he
can
not
endure
in
the
path
of
god
no
errors
can
appall
no
troubles
dismay
him
the
light
of
love
irradiates
his
darkest
days
transmutes
suffering
into
joy
and
martyrdom
itself
into
an
ecstasy
of
bliss
life
is
lifted
to
the
heroic
plane
and
death
becomes
a
glad
adventure
bahá
u
lláh
says
he
that
hath
in
his
heart
even
less
than
a
mustard
seed
of
love
for
anything
beside
me
verily
he
can
not
enter
my
o
son
of
man
if
thou
lovest
me
turn
away
from
thyself
and
if
thou
seekest
my
pleasure
regard
not
thine
own
that
thou
mayest
die
in
me
and
i
may
eternally
live
in
thee
o
my
servant
free
thyself
from
the
fetters
of
this
world
and
loose
thy
soul
from
the
prison
of
self
seize
thy
chance
for
it
will
come
to
thee
no
hidden
words
obedience
devotion
to
god
involves
implicit
obedience
to
his
revealed
commands
even
when
the
reason
for
these
commands
is
not
understood
the
sailor
implicitly
obeys
his
captain
s
orders
even
when
he
does
not
know
the
reason
for
them
but
his
acceptance
of
authority
is
not
blind
he
knows
full
well
that
the
captain
has
served
a
thorough
probation
and
given
ample
proofs
of
competence
as
a
navigator
were
it
not
so
he
would
be
foolish
indeed
to
serve
under
him
so
the
bahá
í
must
implicitly
obey
the
captain
of
his
salvation
but
he
will
be
foolish
indeed
if
he
has
not
first
ascertained
that
this
captain
has
given
ample
proofs
of
trustworthiness
having
received
such
proofs
however
to
refuse
obedience
would
be
even
greater
folly
for
only
by
intelligent
and
obedience
to
the
wise
master
can
we
reap
the
benefits
of
his
wisdom
and
acquire
this
wisdom
for
ourselves
be
the
captain
never
so
wise
if
none
of
the
crew
obey
him
how
shall
the
ship
reach
its
port
or
the
sailors
learn
the
art
of
navigation
christ
clearly
pointed
out
that
obedience
is
the
path
of
knowledge
he
said
my
doctrine
is
not
mine
but
his
that
sent
me
if
any
man
will
do
his
will
he
shall
know
of
the
doctrine
whether
it
be
of
god
or
whether
i
speak
of
john
vii
so
bahá
u
lláh
says
faith
in
god
and
the
knowledge
of
him
can
not
be
fully
attained
except
by
practicing
all
that
he
hath
commanded
and
all
that
is
revealed
in
the
book
from
the
pen
of
of
tajallíyát
implicit
obedience
is
not
a
popular
virtue
in
these
democratic
days
and
indeed
entire
submission
to
the
will
of
any
mere
man
would
be
disastrous
but
the
unity
of
humanity
can
be
attained
only
by
complete
harmony
of
each
and
all
with
the
divine
will
unless
that
will
be
clearly
revealed
and
men
abandon
all
other
leaders
and
obey
the
divine
messenger
then
conflict
and
strife
will
go
on
and
men
will
continue
to
oppose
each
other
to
devote
a
large
part
of
their
energy
to
frustrating
the
efforts
of
their
brother
men
instead
of
working
harmoniously
together
for
the
glory
of
god
and
the
common
good
service
devotion
to
god
implies
a
life
of
service
to
our
creatures
we
can
be
of
service
to
god
in
no
other
way
if
we
turn
our
backs
on
our
fellowmen
we
are
turning
our
backs
upon
god
christ
said
inasmuch
as
ye
did
it
not
to
one
of
the
least
of
these
ye
did
it
not
to
so
bahá
u
lláh
says
o
son
of
man
if
thine
eyes
be
turned
towards
mercy
forsake
the
things
that
profit
thee
and
cleave
unto
that
which
will
profit
mankind
and
if
thine
eyes
be
turned
towards
justice
choose
thou
for
thy
neighbor
that
which
thou
choosest
for
of
paradise
abdu
says
in
the
bahá
í
cause
arts
sciences
and
all
crafts
are
counted
as
worship
the
man
who
makes
a
piece
of
paper
to
the
best
of
his
ability
conscientiously
concentrating
all
his
forces
on
perfecting
it
is
giving
praise
to
god
briefly
all
effort
and
exertion
put
forth
by
man
from
the
fullness
of
his
heart
is
worship
if
it
is
prompted
by
the
highest
motives
and
the
will
to
do
service
to
humanity
this
is
worship
to
serve
mankind
and
to
minister
to
the
needs
of
the
people
service
is
prayer
a
physician
ministering
to
the
sick
gently
tenderly
free
from
prejudice
and
believing
in
the
solidarity
of
the
human
race
is
giving
praise
teaching
the
real
bahá
í
will
not
only
believe
in
the
teachings
of
bahá
u
lláh
but
find
in
them
the
guide
and
inspiration
of
his
whole
life
and
joyfully
impart
to
others
the
knowledge
that
is
the
wellspring
of
his
own
being
only
thus
will
he
receive
in
full
measure
the
power
and
confirmation
of
the
all
can
not
be
eloquent
speakers
or
ready
writers
but
all
can
teach
by
living
the
bahá
u
lláh
says
the
people
of
bahá
must
serve
the
lord
with
wisdom
teach
others
by
their
lives
and
manifest
the
light
of
god
in
their
deeds
the
effect
of
deed
is
in
truth
more
powerful
than
that
of
of
paradise
the
bahá
í
will
however
on
no
account
force
his
ideas
on
those
who
do
not
wish
to
hear
them
he
will
attract
people
to
the
kingdom
of
god
not
try
to
drive
them
into
it
he
will
be
like
the
good
shepherd
who
leads
his
flock
and
charms
the
sheep
by
his
music
rather
than
like
the
one
who
from
behind
urges
them
on
with
dog
and
stick
bahá
u
lláh
says
in
the
hidden
words
o
son
of
dust
the
wise
are
they
that
speak
not
unless
they
obtain
a
hearing
even
as
the
who
proffereth
not
his
cup
till
he
findeth
a
seeker
and
the
lover
who
crieth
not
out
from
the
depths
of
his
heart
until
he
gazeth
upon
the
beauty
of
his
beloved
wherefore
sow
the
seeds
of
wisdom
and
knowledge
in
the
pure
soil
of
the
heart
and
keep
them
hidden
till
the
hyacinths
of
divine
wisdom
spring
from
the
heart
and
not
from
mire
and
clay
again
he
says
in
the
tablet
of
o
people
of
bahá
ye
are
the
of
the
love
and
daysprings
of
the
favor
of
god
defile
not
your
tongues
with
cursing
or
execrating
anyone
and
guard
your
eyes
from
that
which
is
not
worthy
show
forth
that
which
ye
possess
truth
if
it
be
accepted
the
aim
is
attained
if
not
to
rebuke
or
interfere
with
him
who
rejects
is
vain
leave
him
to
himself
and
advance
towards
god
the
protector
the
be
not
the
cause
of
sorrow
how
much
less
of
sedition
and
strife
it
is
hoped
that
ye
may
be
nurtured
in
the
shade
of
the
tree
of
divine
bounty
and
act
as
god
has
willed
for
you
ye
are
all
leaves
of
one
tree
and
drops
of
one
sea
courtesy
and
reverence
bahá
u
lláh
says
o
people
of
god
i
exhort
you
to
courtesy
courtesy
is
indeed
the
lord
of
all
virtues
blessed
is
he
who
is
adorned
with
the
mantle
of
uprightness
and
illumined
with
the
light
of
courtesy
he
who
is
endowed
with
courtesy
or
reverence
is
endowed
with
a
great
station
it
is
hoped
that
this
wronged
one
and
all
will
attain
to
it
hold
unto
it
and
observe
it
this
is
the
irrefutable
command
which
hath
flowed
from
the
pen
of
the
greatest
of
the
world
again
and
again
he
repeats
let
all
the
nations
of
the
world
consort
with
each
other
with
joy
and
fragrance
consort
ye
o
people
with
the
people
of
all
religions
with
joy
and
abdu
says
in
a
letter
to
the
bahá
ís
of
america
beware
beware
lest
ye
offend
any
heart
beware
beware
lest
ye
hurt
any
soul
beware
beware
lest
ye
deal
unkindly
toward
any
person
beware
beware
lest
ye
be
the
cause
of
hopelessness
to
any
creature
should
one
become
the
cause
of
grief
to
any
one
heart
or
of
despondency
to
any
one
soul
it
were
better
to
hide
oneself
in
the
lowest
depths
of
the
earth
than
to
walk
upon
the
earth
he
teaches
that
as
the
flower
is
hidden
in
the
bud
so
a
spirit
from
god
dwells
in
the
heart
of
every
man
no
matter
how
hard
and
unlovely
his
exterior
the
true
bahá
í
will
treat
every
man
therefore
as
the
gardener
tends
a
rare
and
beautiful
plant
he
knows
that
no
impatient
interference
on
his
part
can
open
the
bud
into
a
blossom
only
god
s
sunshine
can
do
that
therefore
his
aim
is
to
bring
that
sunshine
into
all
darkened
hearts
and
homes
again
abdu
says
among
the
teachings
of
bahá
u
lláh
is
one
requiring
man
under
all
conditions
and
circumstances
to
be
forgiving
to
love
his
enemy
and
to
consider
an
as
a
not
that
one
should
consider
another
as
an
enemy
and
then
put
up
with
him
and
be
forbearing
toward
him
this
is
hypocrisy
and
not
real
love
nay
rather
you
must
see
your
enemies
as
friends
your
as
and
treat
them
accordingly
your
love
and
kindness
must
be
real
not
merely
forbearance
for
forbearance
if
not
of
the
heart
is
hypocrisy
such
counsel
appears
unintelligible
and
until
we
realize
that
while
the
outer
carnal
man
may
be
a
hater
and
there
is
in
everyone
an
inner
spiritual
nature
which
is
the
real
man
from
whom
only
love
and
goodwill
can
proceed
it
is
to
this
real
inner
man
in
each
of
our
neighbors
that
we
must
direct
our
thought
and
love
when
he
awakens
into
activity
the
outer
man
will
be
transformed
and
renewed
the
eye
on
no
subject
are
the
bahá
í
teaching
more
imperative
and
uncompromising
than
on
the
requirement
to
abstain
from
faultfinding
christ
spoke
very
strongly
on
the
same
subject
but
it
has
now
become
usual
to
regard
the
sermon
on
the
mount
as
embodying
counsels
of
perfection
which
the
ordinary
christian
can
not
be
expected
to
live
up
to
both
bahá
u
lláh
and
abdu
are
at
great
pains
to
make
it
clear
that
on
this
subject
they
mean
all
they
say
we
read
in
the
hidden
words
o
son
of
man
breathe
not
the
sins
of
others
so
long
as
thou
art
thyself
a
sinner
shouldst
thou
transgress
this
command
accursed
wouldst
thou
be
and
to
this
i
bear
witness
o
son
of
being
ascribe
not
to
any
soul
that
which
thou
wouldst
not
have
ascribed
to
thee
and
say
not
that
which
thou
doest
not
this
is
my
command
unto
thee
do
thou
observe
it
abdu
tells
us
to
be
silent
concerning
the
faults
of
others
to
pray
for
them
and
to
help
them
through
kindness
to
correct
their
faults
to
look
always
at
the
good
and
not
at
the
bad
if
a
man
has
ten
good
qualities
and
one
bad
one
to
look
at
the
ten
and
forget
the
one
and
if
a
man
has
ten
bad
qualities
and
one
good
one
to
look
at
the
one
and
forget
the
ten
never
to
allow
ourselves
to
speak
one
unkind
word
about
another
even
though
that
other
be
our
enemy
to
an
american
friend
he
writes
the
worst
human
quality
and
the
most
great
sin
is
backbiting
more
especially
when
it
emanates
from
the
tongues
of
the
believers
of
god
if
some
means
were
devised
so
that
the
doors
of
backbiting
could
be
shut
eternally
and
each
one
of
the
believers
of
god
unsealed
his
lips
in
praise
of
others
then
the
teachings
of
his
holiness
bahá
u
lláh
would
be
spread
the
hearts
illumined
the
spirits
glorified
and
the
human
world
would
attain
to
everlasting
felicity
humility
while
we
are
commanded
to
overlook
the
faults
of
others
and
see
their
virtues
we
are
commanded
on
the
other
hand
to
find
out
our
own
faults
and
take
no
account
of
our
virtues
bahá
u
lláh
says
in
the
hidden
words
o
son
of
being
how
couldst
thou
forge
thine
own
faults
and
busy
thyself
with
the
faults
of
others
whoso
doeth
this
is
accursed
of
me
o
emigrants
the
tongue
i
have
designed
for
the
mention
of
me
defile
it
not
with
detraction
if
the
fire
of
self
overcome
you
remember
your
own
faults
and
not
the
faults
of
my
creatures
inasmuch
as
every
one
of
you
knoweth
his
own
self
better
than
he
knoweth
others
abdu
says
let
your
life
be
an
emanation
of
the
kingdom
of
christ
he
came
not
to
be
ministered
unto
but
to
minister
in
the
religion
of
bahá
u
lláh
all
are
servants
and
maidservants
brothers
and
sisters
as
soon
as
one
feels
a
little
better
than
a
little
superior
to
the
rest
he
is
in
a
dangerous
position
and
unless
he
casts
away
the
seed
of
such
an
evil
thought
he
is
not
a
fit
instrument
for
the
service
of
the
kingdom
dissatisfaction
with
oneself
is
a
sign
of
progress
the
soul
who
is
satisfied
with
himself
is
the
manifestation
of
satan
and
the
one
who
is
not
contented
with
himself
is
the
manifestation
of
the
merciful
if
a
person
has
a
thousand
good
qualities
he
must
not
look
at
them
nay
rather
he
must
strive
to
find
out
his
own
defects
and
imperfections
much
a
man
may
progress
yet
he
is
imperfect
because
there
is
always
a
point
ahead
of
him
no
sooner
does
he
look
up
towards
that
point
than
he
become
dissatisfied
with
his
own
condition
and
aspires
to
attain
to
that
praising
one
s
own
self
is
the
sign
of
of
mírzá
aḥmad
sohrab
although
we
are
commanded
to
recognize
and
sincerely
repent
of
our
sins
the
practice
of
confession
to
priests
and
others
is
definitely
forbidden
bahá
u
lláh
says
in
the
glad
tidings
the
sinner
when
his
heart
is
free
from
all
save
god
must
seek
forgiveness
from
god
alone
confession
before
the
servants
before
men
is
not
permissible
for
it
is
not
the
means
or
the
cause
of
divine
forgiveness
such
confession
before
the
creatures
leads
to
one
s
humiliation
and
abasement
and
by
his
not
wish
for
the
humiliation
of
his
servants
verily
he
is
compassionate
and
beneficent
the
sinner
must
between
himself
and
god
beg
for
mercy
from
the
sea
of
mercy
and
implore
pardon
from
the
heaven
of
forgiveness
truthfulness
and
honesty
bahá
u
lláh
says
in
the
tablet
of
tarazát
verily
honesty
is
the
door
of
tranquillity
to
all
in
the
world
and
the
sign
of
glory
from
the
presence
of
the
merciful
one
whosoever
attains
thereto
has
attained
to
treasures
of
wealth
and
affluence
honesty
is
the
greatest
door
to
the
security
and
tranquillity
of
mankind
the
stability
of
every
affair
always
depends
on
it
and
the
worlds
of
honor
glory
and
affluence
are
illumined
by
its
light
o
people
of
bahá
honesty
is
the
best
garment
for
your
temples
and
the
most
splendid
crown
for
your
heads
adhere
thereto
by
the
command
of
the
omnipotent
commander
again
he
says
the
principle
of
faith
is
to
lessen

i

from

out

how

thou
busy
thyself
with

unto

that
thou
mayest
find

standing

mighty

o

thou

finely
tempered
sword
concealed
in

of
its
sheath
and
its

hidden
from

come
forth
from

of

that
thy

may
be
made

unto

thou

let
not

defilement
of

eclipse
thy

rend

the

of
heedlessness
that
from
behind
the
clouds
thou
mayest
emerge
resplendent
and
array
all
things
with
the
apparel
of
life
the
life
to
which
bahá
u
lláh
calls
his
followers
is
surely
one
of
such
nobility
that
in
all
the
vast
range
of
human
possibility
there
is
nothing
more
lofty
or
beautiful
to
which
man
could
aspire
realization
of
the
spiritual
self
in
ourselves
means
realization
of
the
sublime
truth
that
we
are
from
god
and
to
him
shall
we
return
this
return
to
god
is
the
glorious
goal
of
the
bahá
í
but
to
attain
this
goal
the
only
path
is
that
of
obedience
to
his
chosen
messengers

to
his
messenger

prayer
is
a
ladder
by
which
everyone
may
ascend
to
conversation
with
god
prayer
says
abdu
is
conversation
with
in
order
that
god
may
make
known
his
mind
and
will
to
men
he
must
speak
to
them
in
a
language
which
they
can
understand
and
this
he
does
by
the
mouths
of
his
holy
prophets
while
these
prophets
are
alive
in
the
body
they
speak
with
men
face
to
face
and
convey
to
them
the
message
of
god
and
after
their
death
their
message
continues
to
reach
men
s
minds
through
their
recorded
sayings
and
writings
but
this
is
not
the
only
way
in
which
god
can
commune
with
and
inspire
those
whose
hearts
are
seeking
after
truth
wherever
they
are
and
whatever
their
native
race
or
tongue
by
this
language
the
manifestation
continues
to
hold
converse
with
the
faithful
after
his
departure
from
the
material
world
christ
continued
to
converse
with
and
inspire
his
disciples
after
his
crucifixion
in
fact
he
influenced
them
more
powerfully
than
before
and
with
other
prophets
it
has
been
the
same
abdu
speaks
much
of
this
spiritual
language
he
says
for
instance
we
should
speak
in
the
language
of
the
language
of
the
there
is
a
language
of
the
spirit
and
heart
it
is
as
different
from
our
language
as
our
own
language
is
different
from
that
of
the
animals
who
express
themselves
only
by
cries
and
sounds
it
is
the
language
of
the
spirit
which
speaks
to
god
when
in
prayer
we
are
freed
from
all
outward
things
and
turn
to
god
then
it
is
as
if
in
our
hearts
we
hear
the
voice
of
god
without
words
we
speak
we
communicate
we
converse
with
god
and
hear
the
answer
all
of
us
when
we
attain
to
a
truly
spiritual
condition
can
hear
the
voice
of
god
from
a
talk
reported
by
miss
ethel
rosenberg
bahá
u
lláh
declares
that
the
higher
spiritual
truths
can
be
communicated
only
by
means
of
this
spiritual
language
the
spoken
or
written
word
is
quite
inadequate
in
a
little
book
called
the
seven
valleys
in
which
he
describes
the
journey
of
travelers
from
the
earthly
dwelling
to
the
divine
home
he
says
in
speaking
of
the
more
advanced
stages
of
the
journey
the
tongue
is
unable
to
give
an
account
of
these
and
utterance
falls
exceedingly
short
the
pen
is
useless
in
this
court
and
the
ink
gives
no
result
but
blackness
heart
alone
can
communicate
to
heart
the
state
of
the
knower
this
is
not
the
work
of
a
messenger
nor
can
it
be
contained
in
letters
the
devotional
attitude
in
order
that
we
may
attain
the
spiritual
condition
in
which
conversation
with
god
becomes
possible
abdu
says
we
must
strive
to
attain
to
that
condition
by
being
separated
from
all
things
and
from
the
people
of
the
world
and
by
turning
to
god
alone
it
will
take
some
effort
on
the
part
of
man
to
attain
to
that
condition
but
he
must
work
for
it
strive
for
it
we
can
attain
to
it
by
thinking
and
caring
less
for
material
things
and
more
for
the
spiritual
the
further
we
go
from
the
one
the
nearer
we
are
to
the
other
the
choice
is
ours
our
spiritual
perception
our
inward
sight
must
be
opened
so
that
we
can
see
the
signs
and
traces
of
god
s
spirit
in
everything
everything
can
reflect
to
us
the
light
of
the
spirit
from
a
talk
reported
by
miss
ethel
rosenberg
bahá
u
lláh
has
written
that
seeker
at
the
dawn
of
every
day
should
commune
with
god
and
with
all
his
soul
persevere
in
the
quest
of
his
beloved
he
should
consume
every
wayward
thought
from
the
flame
of
his
loving
mention
from
the
writings
of
bahá
u
lláh
in
the
same
way
abdu
declares
when
man
allows
the
spirit
through
his
soul
to
enlighten
his
understanding
then
does
he
contain
all
creation
but
on
the
other
hand
when
man
does
not
open
his
mind
and
heart
to
the
blessing
of
the
spirit
but
turns
his
soul
towards
the
material
side
towards
the
bodily
part
of
his
nature
then
his
he
fallen
from
his
high
place
and
he
becomes
inferior
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
lower
animal
kingdom
again
bahá
u
lláh
writes
deliver
your
souls
o
people
from
the
bondage
of
self
and
purify
them
from
all
attachment
to
anything
besides
me
remembrance
of

could
ye
but

it
intone
o
my

the
verses
of
god
that
have
been
received
by
thee
that
the
sweetness
of
thy
melody
may
kindle
thine

soul
and
attract
the
hearts
of
all

whoso
reciteth
in
the

of

the
verses
revealed
by

the
scattering

of

from
the
writings
of

pp
necessity
for
a
mediator
according
to
abdu
a
mediator
is
necessary
between
man
and
the
who
receives
the
full
light
of
the
divine
splendor
and
radiates
it
over
the
human
world
as
the
earth
s
atmosphere
receives
and
diffuses
the
warmth
of
the
sun
s
rays
if
we
wish
to
pray
we
must
have
some
object
on
which
to
concentrate
if
we
turn
to
god
we
must
direct
our
hearts
to
a
certain
center
if
man
worships
god
otherwise
than
through
his
manifestation
he
must
first
form
a
conception
of
god
and
that
conception
is
created
by
his
own
mind
as
the
finite
can
not
comprehend
the
infinite
so
god
is
not
to
be
comprehended
in
this
fashion
that
which
man
conceives
with
his
own
mind
he
comprehends
that
which
he
can
comprehend
is
not
god
that
conception
of
god
which
a
man
forms
for
himself
is
but
a
phantasm
an
image
an
imagination
an
illusion
there
is
no
connection
between
such
a
conception
and
the
supreme
being
if
a
man
wishes
to
know
god
he
must
find
him
in
the
perfect
mirror
christ
or
bahá
u
lláh
in
either
of
these
mirrors
he
will
see
reflected
the
sun
of
divinity
as
we
know
the
physical
sun
by
its
splendor
by
its
light
and
heat
so
we
know
god
the
spiritual
sun
when
he
shines
forth
from
the
temple
of
manifestation
by
his
attributes
of
perfection
by
the
beauty
of
his
qualities
and
by
the
splendor
of
his
light
from
a
talk
to
percy
woodcock
at
akká
again
he
says
unless
the
holy
spirit
become
intermediary
one
can
not
attain
directly
to
the
bounties
of
god
do
not
overlook
the
obvious
truth
for
it
is
that
a
child
can
not
be
instructed
without
a
teacher
and
knowledge
is
one
of
the
bounties
of
god
the
soil
is
not
covered
with
grass
and
vegetation
without
the
rain
of
the
cloud
therefore
the
cloud
is
the
intermediary
between
the
divine
bounties
and
the
soil
the
light
hath
a
center
and
if
one
desire
to
seek
it
otherwise
than
from
the
center
one
can
never
attain
to
it
turn
thine
attention
to
the
days
of
christ
some
people
imagine
that
without
the
messianic
outpourings
it
was
possible
to
attain
to
truth
but
this
very
imagination
became
the
cause
of
the
deprivation
a
man
who
tries
to
worship
god
without
turning
to
his
manifestation
is
like
a
man
in
a
dungeon
trying
through
his
imagination
to
revel
in
the
glories
of
the
sunshine
prayer
indispensable
and

in

terms
bahá

in

every
morning
and

the
one
who
neglects
this
has
not
been
faithful
to
the
covenant
of
god
and
his
agreement
and
he
who
turns
away
from
it
today
is
of
those
who
have
turned
away
from

fear
god
o
my
people
let
not
too
much
reading
of
the
sacred
word
and
actions
by
day
or
night
make
you
proud
to
chant
but
one
verse
with
joy
and
gladness
is
better
for
you
than
reading
all
the
revelations
of
the
omnipotent
god
with
carelessness
chant
the
tablets
of
god
in
such
measure
that
ye
be
not
overtaken
with
fatigue
and
depression
burden
not
the
soul
so
as
to
cause
exhaustion
and
languour
but
rather
refresh
it
that
thus
it
may
soar
on
the
wings
of
revelation
to
the
of
proofs
this
brings
you
nearer
to
god
were
ye
of
those
who
abdu
says
to
a
correspondent
o
thou
spiritual
friend
know
thou
that
prayer
is
indispensable
and
obligatory
and
man
under
no
pretext
whatever
is
excused
therefrom
unless
he
be
mentally
unsound
or
an
insurmountable
obstacle
prevent
another
correspondent
asked
why
pray
what
is
the
wisdom
thereof
for
god
has
established
everything
and
executes
all
affairs
after
the
best
what
is
the
wisdom
in
beseeching
and
supplicating
and
in
stating
one
s
wants
and
seeking
help
abdu
replied
know
thou
verily
it
is
becoming
in
a
weak
one
to
supplicate
to
the
strong
one
and
it
behooveth
a
seeker
of
bounty
to
beseech
the
glorious
bountiful
one
when
one
supplicates
to
his
lord
turns
to
him
and
seeks
bounty
from
his
ocean
this
supplication
brings
light
to
his
heart
illumination
to
his
sight
life
to
his
soul
and
exaltation
to
his
being
during
thy
supplications
to
god
and
thy
reciting
thy
name
is
my
healing
consider
how
thine
heart
is
cheered
thy
soul
delighted
by
the
spirit
of
the
love
of
god
and
thy
mind
attracted
to
the
kingdom
of
god
by
these
attractions
one
s
ability
and
capacity
increase
when
the
vessel
is
enlarged
the
water
increases
and
when
the
thirst
grows
the
bounty
of
the
cloud
becomes
agreeable
to
the
taste
of
man
this
is
the
mystery
of
supplication
and
the
wisdom
of
stating
one
s
wants
from
a
tablet
to
an
american
believer
translated
by
alí
kuli
october
bahá
u
lláh
has
revealed
three
daily
obligatory
prayers
the
believer
is
free
to
choose
any
one
of
these
three
prayers
but
is
under
the
obligation
of
reciting
one
of
them
and
in
the
manner
bahá
u
lláh
has
prescribed
congregational
prayer
the
prayers
which
bahá
u
lláh
has
ordained
as
a
daily
obligation
for
bahá
ís
are
to
be
said
privately
only
in
the
case
of
the
prayer
for
the
dead
has
bahá
u
lláh
commanded
congregational
prayer
and
the
only
requirement
is
that
the
believer
who
reads
it
aloud
and
all
others
present
should
stand
this
differs
from
the
islamic
practice
of
congregational
prayer
in
which
the
believers
stand
in
rows
behind
an
imám
who
leads
the
prayer
which
is
prohibited
in
the
bahá
í
faith
these
ordinances
which
are
in
accordance
with
bahá
u
lláh
s
abolition
of
professional
clergy
do
not
mean
that
he
attached
no
value
to
meetings
for
worship
regarding
the
value
of
gathering
for
prayer
abdu
spoke
as
follows
man
may
say
i
can
pray
to
god
whenever
i
wish
when
the
feelings
of
my
heart
are
drawn
to
god
when
i
am
in
the
wilderness
when
i
am
in
the
city
or
wherever
i
may
be
why
should
i
go
where
others
are
gathered
upon
a
special
day
at
a
certain
hour
to
unite
my
prayers
with
theirs
when
i
may
not
be
in
a
frame
of
mind
for
praying
to
think
in
this
way
is
useless
imagination
for
where
many
are
gathered
together
their
force
is
greater
separate
soldiers
fighting
alone
and
individually
have
not
the
force
of
a
united
army
if
all
the
soldiers
in
this
spiritual
war
gather
together
then
their
united
spiritual
feelings
help
each
other
and
their
prayers
become
acceptable
from
notes
taken
by
miss

rosenberg
prayer
the
language
of
love
to
someone
who
asked
whether
prayer
was
necessary
since
presumably
god
knows
the
wishes
of
all
hearts
abdu
replied
if
one
friend
loves
another
is
it
not
natural
that
he
should
wish
to
say
so
though
he
knows
that
that
friend
is
aware
of
his
love
does
he
still
not
wish
to
tell
him
of
it
it
is
true
that
god
knows
the
wishes
of
all
hearts
but
the
impulse
to
pray
is
a
natural
one
springing
from
man
s
love
to
god
prayer
need
not
be
in
words
but
rather
in
thought
and
action
but
if
this
love
and
this
desire
are
lacking
it
is
useless
to
try
to
force
them
words
without
love
mean
nothing
if
a
person
talks
to
you
as
an
unpleasant
duty
finding
neither
love
nor
enjoyment
in
the
meeting
do
you
wish
to
converse
with
him
article
in
fortnightly
review
by
miss
stevens
in
another
talk
he
said
in
the
highest
prayer
men
pray
only
for
the
love
of
god
not
because
they
fear
him
or
hell
or
hope
for
bounty
or
heaven
when
a
man
falls
in
love
with
a
human
being
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
keep
from
mentioning
the
name
of
his
beloved
how
much
more
difficult
is
it
to
keep
from
mentioning
the
name
of
god
when
one
has
come
to
love
him
the
spiritual
man
finds
no
delight
in

deliverance
from
calamities
according
to
the
teaching
of
the
prophets
disease
and
all
other
forms
of
calamity
are
due
to
disobedience
to
the
divine
commands
even
disasters
due
to
floods
hurricanes
and
earthquakes
are
attributed
by
abdu
indirectly
to
this
cause
the
suffering
that
follows
error
is
not
vindictive
however
but
educative
and
remedial
it
is
god
s
voice
proclaiming
to
man
that
he
has
strayed
from
the
right
path
if
the
suffering
is
terrible
it
is
only
because
the
danger
of
wrongdoing
is
more
terrible
for
the
wages
of
sin
is
just
as
calamity
is
due
to
disobedience
so
deliverance
from
calamity
can
be
obtained
only
be
obedience
there
is
no
chance
or
uncertainty
about
the
matter
turning
from
god
inevitably
brings
disaster
and
turning
to
god
as
inevitably
brings
blessing
as
the
whole
of
humanity
is
one
organism
however
the
welfare
of
each
individual
depends
not
only
on
his
own
behavior
but
on
that
of
his
neighbors
if
one
does
wrong
all
suffer
in
greater
or
less
degree
while
if
one
does
well
all
benefit
each
has
to
bear
his
neighbor
s
burdens
to
some
extent
and
the
best
of
mankind
are
those
who
bear
the
biggest
burdens
the
saints
have
always
suffered
abundantly
the
prophets
have
suffered
superlatively
bahá
u
lláh
says
in
the
book
of
íqán
you
must
undoubtedly
have
been
informed
of
the
tribulations
the
poverty
the
ills
and
the
degradation
that
have
befallen
every
prophet
of
god
and
his
companions
you
must
have
heard
how
the
heads
of
their
followers
were
sent
as
presents
unto
different
cities
this
is
not
because
the
saints
and
prophets
have
merited
punishment
above
other
men
nay
they
often
suffer
for
the
sins
of
others
and
choose
to
suffer
for
the
sake
of
others
their
concern
is
for
the
world
s
welfare
not
for
their
own
the
prayer
of
the
true
lover
of
humanity
is
not
that
he
as
an
individual
may
escape
poverty
or
disaster
but
that
mankind
may
be
saved
from
ignorance
and
error
and
the
ills
that
inevitably
flow
from
them
if
he
wishes
health
or
wealth
for
himself
it
is
in
order
that
he
may
serve
the
kingdom
and
if
physical
health
and
wealth
are
denied
him
he
accepts
his
lot
with
radiant
acquiescence
well
knowing
that
there
is
a
right
wisdom
in
whatever
befalls
him
in
the
path
of
god
abdu
says
grief
and
sorrow
do
not
come
to
us
by
chance
they
are
sent
by
the
divine
mercy
for
our
perfecting
when
grief
and
sorrow
come
then
will
a
man
remember
his
father
who
is
in
heaven
who
is
able
to
deliver
him
from
his
humiliations
the
more
a
man
is
chastened
the
greater
is
the
harvest
of
spiritual
virtues
shown
forth
by
him
at
first
sight
it
may
seem
very
unjust
that
the
innocent
should
suffer
for
the
guilty
but
abdu
assures
us
that
the
injustice
is
only
apparent
and
that
in
the
long
run
perfect
justice
prevails
he
writes
as
to
the
subject
of
babes
and
children
and
weak
ones
who
are
afflicted
by
the
hands
of
the
oppressors
for
those
souls
there
is
a
recompense
in
another
world
that
suffering
is
the
greatest
mercy
of
god
verily
that
mercy
of
the
lord
is
far
better
than
all
the
comfort
of
this
world
and
the
growth
and
development
appertaining
to
this
place
of
mortality
prayer
and
natural
law
many
find
a
difficulty
in
believing
in
the
efficacy
of
prayer
because
they
think
that
answers
to
prayer
would
involve
arbitrary
interference
with
the
laws
of
nature
an
analogy
may
help
to
remove
this
difficulty
if
a
magnet
be
held
over
some
iron
filings
the
latter
will
fly
upwards
and
cling
to
it
but
this
involves
no
interference
with
the
law
of
gravitation
the
force
of
gravity
continues
to
act
on
the
filings
just
as
before
what
has
happened
is
that
a
superior
force
has
been
brought
into
force
whose
action
is
just
as
regular
and
calculable
as
that
of
gravity
the
bahá
í
view
is
that
prayer
brings
into
action
higher
forces
as
yet
comparatively
little
known
but
there
seems
no
reason
to
believe
that
these
forces
are
more
arbitrary
in
their
action
than
the
physical
forces
the
difference
is
that
they
have
not
yet
been
fully
studied
and
experimentally
investigated
and
their
action
appears
mysterious
and
incalculable
because
of
our
ignorance
another
difficulty
which
some
find
perplexing
is
that
prayer
seems
too
feeble
a
force
to
produce
the
great
results
often
claimed
to
it
analogy
may
serve
to
clear
up
this
difficulty
also
a
small
force
when
applied
to
the
sluice
gate
of
a
reservoir
may
release
and
regulate
an
enormous
flow
of
or
when
applied
to
the
steering
gear
of
an
ocean
liner
may
control
the
course
of
the
huge
vessel
in
the
bahá
í
view
the
power
that
brings
about
answers
to
prayer
is
the
inexhaustible
power
of
god
the
part
of
the
suppliant
is
only
to
exert
the
feeble
force
necessary
to
release
the
flow
or
determine
the
course
of
the
divine
bounty
which
is
ever
ready
to
serve
those
who
have
learned
how
to
draw
upon
it
bahá
í
prayers
bahá
u
lláh
and
abdu
have
revealed
innumerable
prayers
for
the
use
of
their
followers
at
various
times
and
for
various
purposes
the
greatness
of
conception
and
depth
of
spirituality
revealed
in
these
utterances
must
impress
every
thoughtful
student
but
only
by
making
their
use
a
regular
and
important
part
of
one
s
daily
life
can
their
significance
be
fully
appreciated
and
their
power
for
good
realized
unfortunately
considerations
of
space
prevent
our
giving
more
than
a
very
few
short
specimens
of
these
prayers
for
further
examples
the
reader
must
be
referred

bahá
í
prayer
is
not
however
confined
to
the
use
of
prescribed
forms
important
as
those
are
bahá
u
lláh
teaches
that
one
s
whole
life
should
be
a
prayer
that
work
done
in
the
right
spirit
is
worship
that
every
thought
word
and
deed
devoted
to
the
glory
of
god
and
the
good
of
one
s
fellows
is
prayer
in
the
truest
sense
of
the

health
and
healing
turning
the
face
towards
god
brings
healing
to
the
body
the
mind
and
the
abdu
body
and
soul
according
to
the
bahá
í
teaching
the
human
body
serves
a
temporary
purpose
in
the
development
of
the
soul
and
when
that
purpose
has
been
served
is
laid
aside
just
as
the
eggshell
serves
a
temporary
purpose
in
the
development
of
the
chick
and
when
that
purpose
has
been
served
is
broken
and
discarded
abdu
says
that
the
physical
body
is
incapable
of
immortality
for
it
is
a
composite
thing
built
up
of
atoms
and
molecules
and
like
all
things
that
are
composed
must
in
time
become
decomposed
the
body
should
be
the
servant
of
the
soul
never
its
master
but
it
should
be
a
willing
obedient
and
efficient
servant
and
should
be
treated
with
the
consideration
which
a
good
servant
deserves
if
it
is
not
properly
treated
disease
and
disaster
result
with
injurious
consequences
to
master
as
well
as
servant
oneness
of
all
life
the
essential
oneness
of
all
the
myriad
forms
and
grades
of
life
is
one
of
the
fundamental
teachings
of
bahá
u
lláh
our
physical
health
is
so
linked
up
with
our
mental
moral
and
spiritual
health
and
also
with
the
individual
and
social
health
of
our
fellowmen
nay
even
with
the
life
of
the
animals
and
plants
that
each
of
these
is
affected
by
the
others
to
a
far
greater
extent
than
is
usually
realized
there
is
no
command
of
the
prophet
therefore
to
whatever
department
of
life
it
may
primarily
refer
which
does
not
concern
bodily
health
certain
of
the
teachings
however
have
a
more
direct
bearing
on
physical
health
than
others
and
these
we
may
now
proceed
to
examine
simple
life
abdu
says
economy
is
the
foundation
of
human
prosperity
the
spendthrift
is
always
in
trouble
prodigality
on
the
part
of
any
person
is
an
unpardonable
sin
we
must
never
live
on
others
like
a
parasitic
plant
every
person
must
have
a
profession
whether
it
be
literary
or
manual
and
must
live
a
clean
manly
honest
life
an
example
of
purity
to
be
imitated
by
others
it
is
more
kingly
to
be
satisfied
with
a
crust
of
stale
bread
than
to
enjoy
a
sumptuous
dinner
of
many
courses
the
money
for
which
comes
out
of
the
pockets
of
others
the
mind
of
a
contented
person
is
always
peaceful
and
his
heart
at
í
scriptures
animal
food
is
not
forbidden
but
abdu
says
fruits
and
grains
will
be
the
foods
of
the
future
the
time
will
come
when
meat
will
no
longer
be
eaten
medical
science
is
only
in
its
infancy
yet
it
has
shown
that
our
natural
diet
is
that
which
grows
out
of
the
days
in
the
light
of
akká
by
julie
grundy
alcohol
and
narcotics
the
use
of
narcotics
and
intoxicants
of
any
kind
except
as
remedies
in
case
of
illness
is
strictly
forbidden
by
bahá
u
lláh
enjoyments
the
bahá
í
teaching
is
based
on
moderation
not
as
asceticism
enjoyment
of
the
good
and
beautiful
things
of
life
both
material
and
spiritual
is
not
only
encouraged
but
enjoined
bahá
u
lláh
says
deprive
not
yourselves
of
that
which
has
been
created
for
again
he
says
it
is
incumbent
upon
you
that
exultation
and
glad
tidings
be
manifest
in
your
abdu
says
all
that
has
been
created
is
for
man
who
is
at
the
apex
of
creation
and
he
must
be
thankful
for
the
divine
bestowals
all
material
things
are
for
us
so
that
through
our
gratitude
we
may
learn
to
understand
life
as
a
divine
benefit
if
we
are
disgusted
with
life
we
are
ingrates
for
our
material
and
spiritual
existence
are
the
outward
evidences
of
the
divine
mercy
therefore
we
must
be
happy
and
spend
our
time
in
praises
appreciating
all
things
asked
whether
the
bahá
í
prohibition
of
gambling
applies
to
game
of
every
description
abdu
replied
no
some
games
are
innocent
and
if
pursued
for
pastime
there
is
no
harm
but
there
is
danger
that
pastime
may
degenerate
into
waste
of
time
waste
of
time
is
not
acceptable
in
the
cause
of
god
but
recreation
which
may
improve
the
bodily
powers
as
exercise
is
heavenly
vista
cleanliness
bahá
u
lláh
says
in
the
book
of
aqdas
be
the
essence
of
cleanliness
among
mankind
under
all
circumstances
conform
yourselves
to
refined
manners
let
no
trace
of
uncleanliness
appear
on
your
clothes
immerse
yourselves
in
pure
water
a
water
which
hath
been
used
is
not
allowable
verily
we
have
desired
to
see
in
you
the
manifestations
of
paradise
on
earth
so
that
there
may
be
diffused
from
you
that
whereat
the
hearts
of
the
favored
ones
shall
mírzá
abu
in
his
book
bahá
í
proofs
points
out
the
extreme
importance
of
these
commands
more
especially
in
some
parts
of
the
east
where
water
of
the
foulest
description
is
often
used
for
household
purposes
for
bathing
and
even
for
drinking
and
horribly
insanitary
conditions
abound
causing
a
vast
amount
of
preventable
disease
and
misery
these
conditions
often
supposed
to
be
sanctioned
by
the
prevailing
religion
can
be
changed
among
orientals
only
by
the
commandment
of
one
who
is
believed
to
have
divine
authority
in
many
parts
of
the
western
hemisphere
too
a
wonderful
transformation
would
result
were
cleanliness
accepted
not
only
as
next
to
godliness
but
as
an
essential
part
of
godliness
effect
of
obedience
to
prophetic
commands
the
bearing
on
health
of
these
commands
relating
to
the
simple
life
hygiene
abstinence
from
alcohol
and
opium
etcetera
is
too
obvious
to
call
for
much
comment
although
their
vital
importance
is
apt
to
be
greatly
underestimated
were
they
to
be
generally
observed
most
of
the
infectious
diseases
and
a
good
many
others
would
soon
vanish
from
among
men
the
amount
of
illness
caused
by
neglect
of
simple
hygienic
precautions
and
by
indulgence
in
alcohol
and
opium
is
prodigious
moreover
obedience
to
these
commands
would
not
only
affect
health
but
would
have
an
enormous
effect
for
good
on
character
and
conduct
alcohol
and
opium
affect
a
man
s
conscience
long
before
they
affect
his
gait
or
cause
obvious
bodily
disease
so
that
the
moral
spiritual
gain
from
abstinence
would
be
even
greater
than
the
physical
with
regard
to
cleanliness
abdu
says
external
cleanliness
although
it
is
but
a
physical
thing
has
great
influence
upon
spirituality
the
fact
of
having
a
pure
and
spotless
body
exercises
an
influence
upon
the
spirit
of
were
the
commands
of
the
prophets
concerning
chastity
in
sexual
relations
generally
observed
another
fertile
cause
of
disease
would
be
eliminated
the
loathsome
venereal
diseases
which
wreck
the
health
of
so
many
thousands
today
innocent
as
well
as
guilty
babes
as
well
as
parents
would
very
soon
be
entirely
a
thing
of
the
past
were
the
commands
of
the
prophets
concerning
justice
mutual
aid
loving
one
s
neighbor
as
oneself
carried
out
how
could
overcrowding
sweated
labor
and
sordid
poverty
on
the
one
hand
together
with
idleness
and
sordid
luxury
on
the
other
continue
to
work
mental
moral
and
physical
ruin
simple
obedience
to
the
hygienic
and
moral
commands
of
moses
buddha
christ
muḥammad
or
bahá
u
lláh
would
do
more
in
the
way
of
preventing
disease
than
all
the
doctors
and
all
the
public
health
regulations
in
the
world
have
been
able
to
accomplish
in
fact
it
seems
certain
that
were
such
obedience
general
good
health
would
also
become
general
instead
of
lives
being
blighted
by
disease
of
cut
off
in
infancy
youth
or
prime
as
so
frequently
happens
now
men
would
live
to
a
ripe
old
age
like
sound
fruits
that
mature
and
mellow
ere
they
drop
from
the
bough
the
prophet
as
physician
we
live
in
a
world
however
where
from
time
immemorial
obedience
to
the
commands
of
the
prophets
has
been
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule
where
love
of
self
has
been
a
more
prevalent
motive
than
love
of
god
where
limited
and
party
interests
have
taken
precedence
of
the
interests
of
humanity
as
a
whole
where
material
possessions
and
sensual
pleasures
have
been
preferred
to
the
social
and
spiritual
welfare
of
mankind
hence
have
arisen
fierce
competition
and
conflict
oppression
and
tyranny
extremes
of
wealth
and
those
conditions
which
breed
disease
mental
and
physical
as
a
consequence
the
whole
tree
of
humanity
is
sick
and
every
leaf
on
the
tree
shares
in
the
general
sickness
even
the
purest
and
holiest
have
to
suffer
for
the
sins
of
others
healing
is
of
humanity
as
a
whole
of
nations
and
of
individuals
so
bahá
u
lláh
like
his
inspired
predecessors
not
only
shows
how
health
is
to
be
maintained
but
also
how
it
may
be
recovered
when
lost
he
comes
as
the
great
physician
the
healer
of
the
world
s
sicknesses
both
of
body
and
of
mind
healing
by
material
means
in
the
western
world
of
today
there
is
evident
a
remarkable
revival
of
belief
in
the
efficacy
of
healing
by
mental
and
spiritual
means
indeed
many
in
their
revolt
against
the
materialistic
ideals
about
disease
and
its
treatment
which
prevailed
in
the
nineteenth
century
have
gone
to
the
opposite
extreme
of
denying
that
material
remedies
or
hygienic
methods
have
any
value
whatsoever
bahá
u
lláh
recognizes
the
value
of
both
material
and
spiritual
remedies
he
teaches
that
the
science
and
art
of
healing
must
be
developed
encouraged
and
perfected
so
that
all
means
of
healing
may
be
used
to
the
best
advantage
each
in
its
appropriate
sphere
when
members
of
bahá
u
lláh
s
own
family
were
sick
a
professional
physician
was
called
in
and
this
practice
is
recommended
to
his
followers
he
says
should
ye
be
attacked
by
illness
or
disease
consult
skillful
this
is
quite
in
accordance
with
the
bahá
í
attitude
towards
science
and
art
generally
all
sciences
and
arts
which
are
for
the
benefit
of
mankind
even
in
a
material
way
are
to
be
esteemed
and
promoted
through
science
man
becomes
the
master
of
material
things
through
ignorance
he
remains
their
slave
bahá
u
lláh
writes
do
not
neglect
medical
treatment
when
it
is
necessary
but
leave
it
off
when
health
has
been
restored
treat
disease
through
diet
by
preference
refraining
from
the
use
of
drugs
and
if
you
find
what
is
required
in
a
single
herb
do
not
resort
to
a
compound
medicament
abstain
from
drugs
when
the
health
is
good
but
administer
them
when
to
a
physician
in
one
of
his
tablets
abdu
says
o
seeker
after
truth
there
are
two
ways
of
healing
sickness
material
means
and
spiritual
means
the
first
way
is
through
the
use
of
material
remedies
the
second
consists
in
praying
to
god
and
in
turning
to
him
both
means
should
be
used
and
practiced
moreover
they
are
not
incompatible
and
you
should
accept
the
physical
remedies
as
coming
from
the
mercy
and
favor
of
god
who
has
revealed
and
made
manifest
medical
knowledge
so
that
his
servants
may
profit
by
this
kind
of
treatment
also
he
teaches
that
were
our
natural
tastes
and
instincts
not
vitiated
by
foolish
and
unnatural
modes
of
living
they
would
become
reliable
guides
in
the
choice
both
of
appropriate
diet
and
of
medicinal
fruits
herbs
and
other
remedies
as
is
the
case
with
wild
animals
in
an
interesting
talk
on
healing
recorded
in
some
answered
questions
he
says
in
conclusion
it
is
therefore
evident
that
it
is
possible
to
cure
by
foods
aliments
and
fruits
but
as
the
science
of
medicine
is
imperfect
this
fact
is
not
yet
fully
grasped
when
the
science
of
medicine
reaches
perfection
treatment
will
be
given
by
foods
aliments
fragrant
fruits
and
vegetables
and
by
various
waters
hot
and
cold
in
temperature
even
when
the
means
of
healing
are
material
the
power
that
heals
is
really
divine
for
the
attributes
of
the
herb
of
mineral
are
from
the
divine
bestowals
all
depends
upon
god
medicine
is
merely
an
outward
form
or
means
by
which
we
obtain
heavenly
healing
by
nonmaterial
means
he
teaches
that
there
are
also
many
methods
of
healing
without
material
means
there
is
a
contagion
of
health
as
well
as
a
contagion
of
disease
although
the
former
is
very
slow
and
has
a
small
effect
while
the
latter
is
often
violent
and
rapid
in
its
action
much
more
powerful
effects
result
from
the
patient
s
own
mental
states
and
suggestion
may
play
an
important
part
in
determining
these
states
fear
anger
worry
et
cetera
are
very
prejudicial
to
health
while
hope
love
joy
et
cetera
are
correspondingly
beneficial
thus
bahá
u
lláh
says
verily
the
most
necessary
thing
is
contentment
under
all
circumstances
by
this
one
is
preserved
from
morbid
conditions
and
lassitude
yield
not
to
grief
and
sorrow
they
cause
the
greatest
misery
jealousy
consumeth
the
body
and
anger
doth
burn
the
liver
avoid
these
two
as
you
would
a
to
a
physician
and
abdu
says
joy
gives
us
wings
in
times
of
joy
our
strength
is
more
vital
our
intellect
keener
but
when
sadness
visits
us
our
strength
leaves
of
another
form
of
mental
healing
abdu
writes
that
it
results
from
the
entire
concentration
of
the
mind
of
a
strong
person
upon
a
sick
person
when
the
latter
expects
with
all
his
concentrated
faith
that
a
cure
will
be
effected
from
the
spiritual
power
of
the
strong
person
to
such
an
extent
that
there
will
be
a
cordial
connection
between
the
strong
person
and
the
invalid
the
strong
person
makes
every
effort
to
cure
the
sick
patient
and
the
sick
patient
is
then
sure
of
receiving
a
cure
from
the
effect
of
these
mental
impressions
an
excitement
of
the
nerves
is
produced
and
this
impression
and
this
excitement
of
the
nerves
will
become
the
cause
of
the
recovery
of
the
sick
answered
questions
all
these
methods
of
healing
however
are
limited
in
their
effects
and
may
fail
to
effect
a
cure
in
severe
maladies
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
the
most
potent
means
of
healing
is
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
this
does
not
depend
on
contact
nor
on
sight
nor
upon
presence
whether
the
disease
be
light
or
severe
whether
there
be
a
contact
of
bodies
or
not
whether
a
personal
connection
be
established
between
the
sick
person
and
the
healer
or
not
this
healing
takes
place
through
the
power
of
the
holy
answered
questions
in
a
talk
with
miss
ethel
rosenberg
in
october
abdu
said
the
healing
that
is
by
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
needs
no
special
concentration
or
contact
it
is
through
the
wish
or
desire
and
the
prayer
of
the
holy
person
the
one
who
is
sick
may
be
in
the
east
and
the
healer
in
the
west
and
they
may
not
have
been
acquainted
with
each
other
but
as
soon
as
that
holy
person
turns
his
heart
to
god
and
begins
to
pray
the
sick
one
is
healed
this
is
a
gift
belonging
to
the
holy
manifestations
and
those
who
are
in
the
highest
station
of
this
nature
apparently
were
the
works
of
healing
performed
by
christ
and
his
apostles
and
similar
works
of
healing
have
been
attributed
to
holy
men
in
all
ages
both
bahá
u
lláh
and
abdu
were
gifted
with
this
power
and
similar
powers
are
promised
to
their
faithful
followers
attitude
of
the
patient
in
order
that
the
power
of
spiritual
healing
may
be
brought
fully
into
operation
certain
requirements
are
necessary
on
the
part
of
the
patient
of
the
healer
of
the
patient
s
friends
and
of
the
community
at
large
on
the
part
of
the
patient
the
prime
requisite
is
turning
with
all
the
heart
to
god
with
implicit
trust
both
in
his
power
and
in
his
will
to
do
whatever
is
best
to
an
american
lady
in
august
abdu
said
all
of
these
ailments
will
pass
away
and
you
will
receive
perfect
physical
and
spiritual
health
let
your
heart
be
confident
and
assured
that
through
the
bounty
of
bahá
u
lláh
through
the
favor
of
bahá
u
lláh
everything
will
become
pleasant
for
you
but
you
must
turn
your
face
wholly
towards
the
abhá
kingdom
giving
perfect
same
attention
that
mary
magdalene
gave
to
his
holiness
i
assure
you
that
you
will
get
physical
and
spiritual
health
you
are
worthy
i
give
you
the
glad
tidings
that
you
are
worthy
because
your
heart
is
pure
be
confident
be
happy
be
rejoiced
be
hopeful
although
in
this
particular
case
abdu
guaranteed
the
attainment
of
sound
physical
health
he
does
not
do
so
in
every
case
even
where
there
is
strong
faith
on
the
part
of
the
individual
to
a
pilgrim
in
akká
he
said
the
prayers
which
were
written
for
the
purpose
of
healing
are
both
for
the
spiritual
and
material
healing
if
healing
is
best
for
the
patient
surely
it
will
be
granted
for
some
who
are
sick
healing
for
them
shall
be
the
cause
of
other
ills
thus
it
is
that
wisdom
does
not
decree
the
answer
to
some
prayers
o
of
god
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
heals
both
material
and
spiritual
lessons
received
at
akká
again
he
writes
to
one
who
is
ill
verily
the
will
of
god
acts
sometimes
in
a
way
for
which
mankind
is
unable
to
find
out
the
reason
the
causes
and
reasons
shall
appear
trust
in
god
and
confide
in
him
and
resign
thyself
to
the
will
of
god
verily
thy
god
is
affectionate
compassionate
and
merciful
and
will
cause
his
mercy
to
descend
upon
thee
he
teaches
that
spiritual
health
is
conducive
to
physical
health
but
physical
health
depends
upon
many
factors
some
of
which
are
outside
the
control
of
the
individual
even
the
most
exemplary
spiritual
attitude
on
the
part
of
the
individual
therefore
may
not
ensure
physical
health
in
every
case
the
holiest
men
and
women
sometimes
suffer
illness
nevertheless
the
beneficent
influence
on
bodily
health
which
results
from
a
right
spiritual
attitude
is
far
more
potent
than
is
generally
imagined
and
is
sufficient
to
banish
in
a
large
proportion
of
cases
abdu
wrote
to
an
english
lady
you
have
written
about
the
weakness
of
your
body
i
ask
from
the
bounties
of
bahá
u
lláh
that
your
spirit
may
become
strong
that
through
the
strength
of
your
spirit
your
body
also
may
be
again
he
says
god
hath
bestowed
upon
man
such
wonderful
powers
that
he
might
ever
look
upward
and
receive
among
other
gifts
healing
from
his
divine
bounty
but
alas
man
is
not
grateful
for
this
supreme
good
but
sleeps
the
sleep
of
negligence
being
careless
of
the
great
mercy
which
god
has
shown
towards
him
turning
his
face
away
from
the
light
and
going
on
his
way
in
darkness
the
healer
the
power
of
spiritual
healing
is
doubtless
common
to
all
mankind
in
greater
or
less
degree
but
just
as
some
men
are
endowed
with
exceptional
talent
for
mathematics
or
music
so
others
appear
to
be
endowed
with
exceptional
aptitude
for
healing
these
are
the
people
who
ought
to
make
the
healing
art
their
lifework
unfortunately
so
materialistic
has
the
world
become
in
recent
centuries
that
the
very
possibility
of
spiritual
healing
has
to
a
large
extent
been
lost
sight
of
like
all
other
talents
the
gift
of
healing
has
to
be
recognized
trained
and
educated
in
order
that
it
may
attain
its
highest
development
and
power
and
there
are
probably
thousands
in
the
world
today
richly
dowered
with
natural
aptitude
for
healing
in
whom
this
precious
gift
is
lying
dormant
and
inactive
when
the
potentialities
of
mental
and
spiritual
treatment
are
more
fully
realized
the
healing
art
will
be
transformed
and
ennobled
and
its
efficacy
immeasurably
increased
and
when
this
new
knowledge
and
power
in
the
healer
are
combined
with
lively
faith
and
hope
on
the
part
of
the
patient
wonderful
results
may
be
looked
for
in
god
must
be
our
trust
there
is
no
god
but
him
the
healer
the
knower
the
helper
nothing
in
earth
or
heaven
is
outside
the
grasp
of
god
o
physician
in
treating
the
sick
first
mention
the
name
of
thy
god
the
possessor
of
the
day
of
judgment
and
then
use
what
god
hath
destined
for
the
healing
of
his
creatures
by
my
life
the
physician
who
has
drunk
from
the
wine
of
my
love
his
visit
is
healing
and
his
breath
is
mercy
and
hope
cling
to
him
for
the
welfare
of
the
constitution
he
is
confirmed
by
god
in
his
treatment
this
knowledge
of
the
healing
art
is
the
most
important
of
all
the
sciences
for
it
is
the
greatest
means
from
god
the
to
the
dust
for
preserving
the
bodies
of
all
people
and
he
has
put
it
in
the
forefront
of
all
sciences
and
wisdoms
for
this
is
the
day
when
you
must
arise
for
my
victory
thy
name
is
my
healing
o
my
god
and
remembrance
of
thee
is
my
remedy
nearness
to
thee
is
my
hope
and
love
for
thee
is
my
companion
thy
mercy
to
me
is
my
healing
and
my
succor
in
both
this
world
and
the
world
to
come
thou
verily
art
the
the
the
u
lláh
tablet
to
a
physician
abdu
writes
he
who
is
filled
with
love
of
bahá
and
forgets
all
things
the
holy
spirit
will
be
heard
from
his
lips
and
the
spirit
of
life
will
fill
his
heart
words
will
issue
from
his
lips
in
strands
of
pearls
and
all
sickness
and
disease
will
be
healed
by
the
laying
on
of
the
hands
o
thou
pure
and
spiritual
one
turn
thou
toward
god
with
thy
heart
beating
with
his
love
devoted
to
his
praise
gazing
towards
his
kingdom
and
seeking
help
from
his
holy
spirit
in
a
state
of
ecstasy
rapture
love
yearning
joy
and
fragrance
god
will
assist
thee
through
a
spirit
from
his
presence
to
heal
sickness
and
disease
continue
in
healing
hearts
and

and
seek
healing
for

by
turning
unto

the
heart
upon
obtaining
healing
through
the
power
of
the
greatest
name
and
by
the
spirit
of
the
love
of

how
all
can
help
the
work
of
healing
the
sick
however
is
a
matter
that
concerns
not
the
patient
and
the
practitioner
only
but
everyone
all
must
help
by
sympathy
and
service
by
right
living
and
right
thinking
and
especially
by
prayer
for
of
all
remedies
prayer
is
the
most
potent
supplication
and
prayer
on

of
others

surely

of
the

a
special
responsibility
for
their
influence
either
for
good
or
ill
is
most
direct
and
powerful
in
how
many
cases
of
sickness
the
issue
depends
mainly
on
the
ministrations
of
parents
friends
or
neighbors
of
the
helpless
sufferer
even
the
members
of
the
community
at
large
have
an
influence
in
every
case
of
sickness
in
individual
cases
that
influence
may
not
appear
great
yet
in
the
mass
the
effect
is
potent
everyone
is
affected
by
the
social
atmosphere
in
which
he
lives
by
the
general
prevalence
of
faith
or
materialism
of
virtue
or
vice
of
cheerfulness
of
depression
and
each
individual
has
his
share
in
determining
the
state
of
that
social
it
may
not
be
possible
for
everyone
in
the
present
state
of
the
world
to
attain
to
perfect
health
but
it
is
possible
for
everyone
to
become
a
willing
channel
for
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
and
thus
to
exert
a
healing
helpful
influence
both
on
his
own
body
and
on
all
with
whom
he
comes
in
contact
few
duties
are
impressed
on
bahá

more
repeatedly
and
emphatically
than
that
of

the

and
many
beautiful
prayers
for
healing
have
been
revealed
by
both
bahá
u

and
abdu
the

bahá
u

gives
the
assurance
that
through
harmonious
cooperation
of
patients
healers
and
the
community
in
general
and
by
appropriate
use
of
the
various
means
to
health
material

the
golden
age
may
be
realized
when
by
the
power

all
sorrow
will
be
turned
into
joy
and
all
disease
into
abdu
says
that
when
the
divine
message
is
understood
all
troubles
will
again
he
says
when
the
material
world
and
the
divine
world
are
well
correlated
when
the

become
heavenly
and
the

pure
perfect

shall
take

then
shall
this

produce

and
spiritual

will
then
receive
absolute
healing
right
use
of
health
in
concluding
this
chapter
it
will
be
well
to
recall
abdu
s
teaching
as
to
the
right
use
of
physical
health
in
one
of
his
tablets
to
the
bahá
ís
of
washington
he
says
if
the
health
and
of
the
body
be
expended
in
the
path
of
the
kingdom
this
is
very
acceptable
and
praiseworthy
and
if
it
be
expended
to
the
benefit
of
the
human
world
in
though
it
be
to
their
material
or
bodily
be
a
means
of
doing
good
that
is
also
acceptable
but
if
the
health
and
welfare
of
man
be
spent
in
sensual
desires
in
a
life
on
the
animal
plane
and
in
devilish
disease
were
better
than
such
health
nay
death
itself
were
preferable
to
such
a
life
if
thou
art
desirous
of
health
wish
thou
health
for
serving
the
kingdom
i
hope
that
thou
mayest
attain
perfect
insight
inflexible
resolution
complete
health
and
spiritual
and
physical
strength
in
order
that
thou
mayest
drink
from
the
fountain
of
eternal
life
and
be
assisted
by
the
spirit
of

confirmation

religious
unity
o
ye
that
dwell
on
earth
the
distinguishing
feature
that
marketh
the
preeminent
character
of
this
supreme
revelation
consisteth
in
that
we
have
on
the
one
hand
blotted
out
from
the
pages
of
god
s
book
whatsoever
hath
been
the
cause
of
strife
of
malice
and
mischief
amongst
the
children
of
men
and
have
on
the
other
laid
down
the
essential
prerequisites
of

of
understanding
of
complete
and
enduring
unity
well
is
it
with
them
that
keep

sectarianism
in
the
nineteenth
century
never
perhaps
did
the
world
seem
farther
away
from
religious
unity
than
in
the
nineteenth
century
for
many
centuries
had
the
great
religious
zoroastrian
mosaic
buddhist
christian
muḥammadan
and
existing
side
by
side
but
instead
of
blending
together
into
a
harmonious
whole
they
had
been
at
constant
enmity
and
strife
each
against
the
others
not
only
so
but
each
had
become
split
up
by
division
after
division
into
an
increasing
number
of
sects
which
were
often
bitterly
opposed
to
each
other
yet
christ
had
said
by
this
shall
all
men
know
that
ye
are
my
disciples
if
ye
have
love
one
to
another
and
muḥammad
had
said
this
your
religion
is
the
one
religion
to
you
hath
god
prescribed
the
faith
which
he
commanded
unto
noah
and
which
we
have
revealed
unto
thee
and
which
we
commanded
unto
abraham
and
moses
and
jesus
saying
observe
this
faith
and
be
not
divided
into
sects
therein
the
founder
of
every
one
of
the
great
religions
had
called
his
followers
to
love
and
unity
but
in
every
case
the
aim
of
the
founder
was
to
a
large
extent
lost
sight
of
in
a
welter
of
intolerance
and
bigotry
formalism
and
hypocrisy
corruption
and
misrepresentation
schism
and
contention
the
aggregate
number
of
more
or
less
hostile
sects
in
the
world
was
probably
greater
at
the
commencement
of
the
bahá
í
era
than
at
any
previous
period
in
human
history
it
seemed
as
if
humanity
at
that
time
were
experimenting
with
every
possible
kind
of
religious
belief
with
every
possible
sort
of
ritual
and
ceremonial
observance
with
every
possible
variety
of
moral
code
at
the
same
time
an
increasing
number
of
men
were
devoting
their
energies
to
fearless
investigation
and
critical
examination
of
the
laws
of
nature
and
the
foundations
of
belief
new
scientific
knowledge
was
being
rapidly
acquired
and
new
solutions
were
being
found
for
many
of
the
problems
of
life
the
development
of
inventions
such
as
steamship
and
railway
postal
system
and
press
greatly
aided
the
diffusion
of
ideas
and
the
fertilizing
contact
of
widely
different
types
of
thought
and
life
the
conflict
between
religion
and
science
became
a
fierce
battle
in
the
christian
world
biblical
criticism
combined
with
physical
science
to
dispute
and
to
some
extent
to
refute
the
authority
of
the
bible
an
authority
that
for
centuries
had
been
the
generally
accepted
basis
of
belief
a
rapidly
increasing
proportion
of
the
population
became
skeptical
about
the
teachings
of
the
churches
a
large
number
even
of
religious
priests
secretly
or
openly
entertained
doubts
or
reservations
regarding
the
creeds
adhered
to
by
their
respective
denominations
this
ferment
and
flux
of
opinion
with
increasing
recognition
of
the
inadequacy
of
the
old
orthodoxies
and
dogmas
and
groping
and
striving
after
fuller
knowledge
and
understanding
were
not
confined
to
christian
countries
but
were
manifest
more
or
less
and
in
different
forms
among
the
people
of
all
countries
and
religions
the
message
of
bahá
u
lláh
it
was
when
this
state
of
conflict
and
confusion
was
at
its
height
that
bahá
u
lláh
sounded
his
great
trumpet
call
to
humanity
that
all
nations
should
become
one
in
faith
and
all
men
as
brothers
that
the
bonds
of
affection
and
unity
between
the
sons
of
men
should
be
strengthened
that
diversity
of
religion
should
cease
and
differences
of
race
be
annulled
these
strifes
and
this
bloodshed
and
discord
must
cease
and
all
men
be
as
one
kindred
and
one
family
words
spoken
to
professor
browne
it
is
a
glorious
message
but
how
are
its
proposals
to
be
carried
into
effect
prophets
have
preached
poets
have
sung
and
saints
have
prayed
about
these
things
for
thousands
of
years
but
diversities
of
religion
have
not
ceased
nor
have
strife
and
bloodshed
and
discord
been
annulled
what
is
there
to
show
that
now
the
miracle
is
to
be
accomplished
are
there
any
new
factors
in
the
situation
is
not
human
nature
the
same
as
it
ever
was
and
will
it
not
continue
to
be
the
same
while
the
world
lasts
if
two
people
want
the
same
thing
or
two
nations
will
they
not
fight
for
it
in
the
future
as
they
have
done
in
the
past
if
moses
buddha
christ
and
muḥammad
failed
to
achieve
world
unity
will
bahá
u
lláh
succeed
if
all
previous
faiths
become
corrupted
and
rent
asunder
into
sects
will
not
the
bahá
í
faith
share
the
same
fate
let
us
see
what
answer
the
bahá
í
teachings
give
to
these
and
similar
questions
can
human
nature
change
education
and
religion
are
alike
based
on
the
assumption
that
it
is
possible
to
change
human
nature
in
fact
it
requires
but
little
investigation
to
show
that
the
one
thing
we
can
say
with
certainty
about
any
living
thing
is
that
it
can
not
keep
from
changing
without
change
there
can
be
no
life
even
the
mineral
can
not
resist
change
and
the
higher
we
go
in
the
scale
of
being
the
more
varied
complex
and
wonderful
do
the
changes
become
moreover
in
progress
and
development
among
creatures
of
all
grades
we
find
two
kinds
of
slow
gradual
often
almost
imperceptible
and
the
other
rapid
sudden
and
dramatic
the
latter
occur
at
what
are
called
critical
stages
of
development
in
the
case
of
minerals
we
find
such
critical
stages
at
the
melting
and
boiling
points
for
example
when
the
solid
suddenly
becomes
a
liquid
or
the
liquid
becomes
a
gas
in
the
case
of
plants
we
see
such
critical
stages
when
the
seed
begins
to
germinate
or
the
bud
bursts
into
leaf
in
the
animal
world
we
see
the
same
on
every
hand
as
when
the
grub
suddenly
changes
into
a
butterfly
the
chick
emerges
from
its
shell
or
the
babe
is
born
from
its
mother
s
womb
in
the
higher
life
of
the
soul
we
often
see
a
similar
transformation
when
a
man
is
born
again
and
his
whole
being
becomes
radically
changes
in
its
aims
its
character
and
activities
such
critical
stages
often
affect
a
whole
species
or
multitude
of
species
simultaneously
as
when
vegetation
of
all
kinds
suddenly
bursts
into
new
life
in
springtime
bahá
u
lláh
declares
that
just
as
lesser
living
things
have
times
of
sudden
emergence
into
new
and
fuller
life
so
for
mankind
also
a
critical
stage
a
time
of
rebirth
is
at
hand
then
modes
of
life
which
have
persisted
from
the
dawn
of
history
up
till
now
will
be
quickly
irrevocably
altered
and
humanity
enter
on
a
new
phase
of
life
as
different
from
the
old
as
the
butterfly
is
different
from
the
caterpillar
or
the
bird
from
the
egg
mankind
as
a
whole
in
the
light
of
new
revelation
will
attain
to
a
new
vision
of
truth
as
a
whole
country
is
illumined
when
the
sun
rises
so
that
all
men
see
clearly
where
but
an
hour
before
everything
was
dark
and
dim
this
is
a
new
cycle
of
human
power
says
abdu
all
the
horizons
of
the
world
are
luminous
and
the
world
will
become
indeed
as
a
rose
garden
and
a
the
analogies
of
nature
are
all
in
favor
of
such
a
view
the
prophets
of
old
have
with
one
accord
foretold
the
advent
of
such
a
glorious
day
the
signs
of
the
times
show
clearly
that
profound
and
revolutionary
changes
in
human
ideas
and
institutions
are
even
now
in
progress
what
could
be
more
futile
and
baseless
therefore
than
the
pessimistic
argument
that
although
all
things
else
change
human
nature
can
not
change
first
steps
toward
unity
as
a
means
of
promoting
religious
unity
bahá
u
lláh
advocates
the
utmost
charity
and
tolerance
and
calls
on
his
followers
to
consort
with
the
people
of
all
religions
with
joy
and
in
his
last
will
and
testament
he
says
contention
and
conflict
hath
he
strictly
forbidding
in
his
book
such
is
the
command
of
the
lord
in
this
command
which
he
hath
exempted
from
all
annulment
and
arrayed
with
the
adorning
of
his
confirmation
o
ye
people
of
the
world
the
religion
of
god
is
for
the
sake
of
love
and
union
make
it
not
the
cause
of
enmity
and
conflict
the
hope
is
cherished
that
the
people
of
bahá
shall
ever
turn
unto
the
hallowed
word
lo
all
things
are
of
word
that
like
unto
water
quencheth
the
fire
of
hate
and
rancor
which
doth
smoulder
in
hearts
and
breasts
by
this
one
word
shall
the
diverse
sects
of
the
world
attain
unto
the
light
of
real
union
verily
the
truth
he
speaketh
and
to
the
path
he
leadeth
and
he
is
the
mighty
the
gracious
the
beauteous
abdu
says
all
must
abandon
prejudices
and
must
even
go
to
each
other
s
churches
and
mosques
for
in
all
of
these
worshipping
places
the
name
of
god
is
mentioned
since
all
gather
to
worship
god
what
difference
is
there
none
of
them
worship
satan
the
muḥammadans
must
go
to
the
churches
of
the
christians
and
the
synagogues
of
the
jews
and
vice
versa
the
others
must
go
to
the
muḥammadan
mosques
they
hold
aloof
from
one
another
merely
because
of
unfounded
prejudices
and
dogmas
in
america
i
went
to
the
jewish
synagogues
which
are
similar
to
the
christian
churches
and
i
saw
them
worshipping
god
everywhere
in
many
of
these
places
i
spoke
about
the
original
foundations
of
the
divine
religions
and
i
explained
to
them
the
proofs
of
the
validity
of
the
divine
prophets
and
of
the
holy
manifestations
i
encouraged
them
to
do
away
with
blind
imitations
all
of
the
leaders
must
likewise
go
to
each
other
s
churches
and
speak
of
the
foundation
and
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
divine
religions
in
the
utmost
unity
and
harmony
they
must
worship
god
in
the
worshipping
places
of
one
another
and
must
abandon
fanaticism
were
even
these
first
steps
accomplished
and
a
state
of
friendly
mutual
tolerance
established
between
the
various
religious
sects
what
a
wonderful
change
would
be
brought
about
in
the
world
in
order
that
real
unity
may
be
achieved
however
something
more
than
this
is
required
for
the
disease
of
sectarianism
tolerance
is
a
valuable
palliative
but
it
is
not
a
radical
cure
it
does
not
remove
the
cause
of
the
trouble
the
problem
of
authority
the
different
religious
communities
have
failed
to
unite
in
the
past
because
the
adherents
of
each
have
regarded
the
founder
of
their
own
community
as
the
one
supreme
authority
and
his
law
as
the
divine
law
any
prophet
who
proclaimed
a
different
message
was
therefore
regarded
as
an
enemy
of
the
truth
the
different
sects
of
each
community
have
separated
for
similar
reasons
the
adherents
of
each
have
accepted
some
subordinate
authority
and
regarded
some
particular
version
or
interpretation
of
the
founder
s
message
as
the
one
true
faith
and
all
others
as
wrong
it
is
obvious
that
while
this
state
of
matters
exists
no
true
unity
is
possible
bahá
u
lláh
on
the
other
hand
teaches
that
all
the
prophets
were
bearers
of
authentic
messages
from
god
that
each
in
his
day
gave
the
highest
teachings
of
all
are
essentially
in
harmony
and
are
parts
of
a
great
plan
for
the
education
and
the
unification
of
humanity
he
calls
on
the
people
of
all
denominations
to
show
their
reverence
for
their
prophets
by
devoting
their
lives
to
the
accomplishment
of
that
unity
for
which
all
the
prophets
labored
and
suffered
in
his
letter
to
queen
victoria
he
likens
the
world
to
a
sick
man
whose
malady
is
aggravated
because
he
has
fallen
into
the
hands
of
unskilled
physicians
and
he
tells
how
the
remedy
may
be
effected
that
which
the
lord
hath
ordained
as
the
sovereign
remedy
and
mightiest
instrument
for
the
healing
of
all
the
world
is
the
union
of
all
its
peoples
in
one
universal
cause
one
common
faith
this
can
in
no
wise
be
achieved
except
through
the
power
of
a
skilled
an
and
inspired
physician
this
verily
is
the
truth
and
all
else
naught
but
from
the
writings
of
bahá
u
lláh
progressive
revelation
a
great
stumbling
block
to
many
in
the
way
of
religious
unity
is
the
difference
between
the
revelations
given
by
the
different
prophets
what
is
commanded
by
one
is
forbidden
by
another
how
then
can
both
be
right
how
can
both
be
proclaiming
the
will
of
god
surely
the
truth
is
one
and
can
not
change
yes
the
absolute
truth
is
one
and
can
not
change
but
the
absolute
truth
is
infinitely
beyond
the
present
range
of
human
understanding
and
our
conceptions
of
it
must
constantly
change
our
earlier
imperfect
ideas
will
be
by
the
grace
of
god
replaced
as
time
goes
on
by
more
and
more
adequate
conceptions
bahá
u
lláh
says
in
a
tablet
to
some
bahá
ís
of
persia
o
people
words
are
revealed
according
to
capacity
so
that
the
beginners
may
make
progress
the
milk
must
be
given
according
to
measure
so
that
the
babe
of
the
world
may
enter
into
the
realm
of
grandeur
and
be
established
in
the
court
of
unity
it
is
milk
that
strengthens
the
babe
so
that
it
can
digest
more
solid
food
later
on
to
say
that
because
one
prophet
is
right
in
giving
a
certain
teaching
at
a
certain
time
therefore
another
prophet
must
be
wrong
who
gives
a
different
teaching
at
a
different
time
is
like
saying
that
because
milk
is
the
best
food
for
the
newborn
babe
therefore
milk
and
nothing
but
milk
should
be
the
food
of
the
grown
man
also
and
to
give
any
other
diet
would
be
wrong
abdu
says
each
divine
revelation
is
divided
into
two
parts
the
first
part
is
essential
and
belongs
to
the
eternal
world
it
is
the
exposition
of
divine
truths
and
essential
principles
it
is
the
expression
of
the
love
of
god
this
is
one
in
all
the
religions
unchangeable
and
immutable
the
second
part
is
not
eternal
it
deals
with
practical
life
transactions
and
business
and
changes
according
to
the
evolution
of
man
and
the
requirements
of
the
time
of
each
prophet
for
example
during
the
mosaic
period
the
hand
of
a
person
was
cut
off
in
punishment
of
a
small
theft
there
was
a
law
of
an
eye
for
an
eye
and
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
but
as
these
laws
were
not
expedient
in
the
time
of
christ
they
were
abrogated
likewise
divorce
had
become
so
universal
that
there
remained
no
fixed
laws
of
marriage
therefore
his
holiness
christ
forbade
divorce
according
to
the
exigencies
of
the
time
his
holiness
moses
revealed
ten
laws
for
capital
punishment
it
was
impossible
at
that
time
to
protect
the
community
and
to
preserve
social
security
without
these
severe
measures
for
the
children
of
israel
lived
in
the
wilderness
of
tah
where
there
were
no
established
courts
of
justice
and
no
penitentiaries
but
this
code
of
conduct
was
not
needed
in
the
time
of
christ
the
history
of
the
second
part
of
religion
is
unimportant
because
it
relates
to
the
customs
of
this
life
only
but
the
foundation
of
the
religion
of
god
is
one
and
his
holiness
bahá
u
lláh
has
renewed
that
foundation
the
religion
of
god
is
the
one
religion
and
all
the
prophets
have
taught
it
but
it
is
a
living
and
a
growing
thing
not
lifeless
and
unchanging
in
the
teaching
of
moses
we
see
the
bud
in
that
of
christ
the
flower
in
that
of
bahá
u
lláh
the
fruit
the
flower
does
not
destroy
the
bud
nor
does
the
fruit
destroy
the
flower
it
destroys
not
but
fulfills
the
bud
scales
must
fall
in
order
that
the
flower
may
bloom
and
the
petals
must
fall
that
the
fruit
may
grow
and
ripen
were
the
bud
scales
and
the
petals
wrong
or
useless
then
that
they
had
to
be
discarded
nay
both
in
their
time
were
right
and
necessary
without
them
there
could
have
been
no
fruit
so
it
is
with
the
various
prophetic
teachings
their
externals
change
from
age
to
age
but
each
revelation
is
the
fulfillment
of
its
predecessors
they
are
not
separate
or
incongruous
but
different
stages
in
the
life
history
of
the
one
religion
which
has
in
turn
been
revealed
as
seed
as
bud
and
as
flower
and
now
enters
on
the
stage
of
fruition
infallibility
of
the
prophets
bahá
u
lláh
teaches
that
everyone
endowed
with
the
station
of
prophethood
is
given
sufficient
proofs
of
his
mission
is
entitled
to
claim
obedience
from
all
men
and
has
authority
to
abrogate
alter
or
add
to
the
teachings
of
his
predecessors
in
the
book
of
íqán
we
read
how
far
from
the
grace
of
the
and
from
his
loving
providence
and
tender
mercies
it
is
to
single
out
a
soul
from
amongst
all
men
for
the
guidance
of
his
creatures
and
on
one
hand
to
withhold
from
him
the
full
measure
of
his
divine
testimony
and
on
the
other
inflict
severe
retribution
on
his
people
for
having
turned
away
from
his
chosen
one
nay
the
manifold
bounties
of
the
lord
of
all
beings
have
at
all
times
through
the
manifestations
of
his
divine
essence
encompassed
the
earth
and
all
that
dwell
therein
and
yet
is
not
the
object
of
every
revelation
to
effect
a
transformation
in
the
whole
character
of
mankind
a
transformation
that
shall
manifest
itself
both
outwardly
and
inwardly
that
shall
affect
both
its
inner
life
and
external
conditions
for
if
the
character
of
mankind
be
not
changed
the
futility
of
god
s
universal
manifestations
would
be
pp
god
is
the
one
infallible
authority
and
the
prophets
are
infallible
because
their
message
is
the
message
of
god
given
to
the
world
through
them
that
message
remains
valid
until
it
is
superseded
by
a
later
message
given
by
the
same
or
another
prophet
god
is
the
great
physician
who
alone
can
rightly
diagnose
the
world
s
sickness
and
prescribe
the
appropriate
remedy
the
remedy
prescribed
in
one
age
is
no
longer
suitable
in
a
later
age
when
the
condition
of
the
patient
is
different
to
cling
to
the
old
remedy
when
the
physician
has
ordered
new
treatment
is
not
to
show
faith
in
the
physician
but
infidelity
it
may
be
a
shock
to
the
jew
to
be
told
that
some
of
the
remedies
for
the
world
s
sickness
which
moses
ordered
over
three
thousand
years
ago
are
now
out
of
date
and
unsuitable
the
christian
may
be
equally
shocked
when
told
that
muḥammad
had
anything
necessary
or
valuable
to
add
to
what
jesus
prescribed
and
so
also
the
muslim
when
asked
to
admit
that
the
báb
or
bahá
u
lláh
had
authority
to
alter
the
commands
of
muḥammad
but
according
to
the
bahá
í
view
true
devotion
to
god
implies
reverence
to
all
his
prophets
and
implicit
obedience
to
his
latest
commands
as
given
by
the
prophet
for
our
own
age
only
by
such
devotion
can
true
unity
be
attained
the
supreme
manifestation
like
all
the
other
prophets
bahá
u
lláh
states
his
own
mission
in
the
most
unmistakable
terms
in
the
a
tablet
addressed
especially
to
christians
he
says
surely
the
father
hath
come
and
hath
fulfilled
that
which
you
were
promised
in
the
kingdom
of
god
this
is
the
word
which
the
son
veiled
when
he
said
to
those
around
him
that
at
that
time
they
could
not
bear
it
but
when
the
stated
time
was
ended
and
the
hour
arrived
the
word
shone
forth
from
the
horizon
of
the
will
beware
o
concourse
of
the
son
christians
cast
it
not
behind
you
but
hold
thereunto
it
is
better
for
you
than
all
that
which
is
before
you
verily
the
spirit
of
truth
is
come
to
guide
you
into
all
truth
verily
he
speaketh
not
from
himself
nay
but
rather
from
the
and
wise
he
is
the
one
whom
the
son
hath
glorified
abandon
that
which
is
before
you
o
people
of
the
earth
and
take
that
which
is
commanded
you
by
him
who
is
the
powerful
the
faithful
and
in
a
letter
to
the
pope
written
from
adrianople
in
he
says
beware
lest
celebration
hinder
you
from
the
celebrated
and
worship
hinder
you
from
the
worshipped
one
behold
the
lord
the
mighty
the
he
hath
come
to
minister
to
the
life
of
the
world
and
for
the
uniting
of
whatever
dwelleth
therein
come
o
ye
people
to
the
of
revelation
tarry
not
even
for
an
hour
are
ye
learned
of
the
gospel
and
yet
are
unable
to
see
the
lord
of
glory
this
beseemeth
you
not
o
learned
concourse
say
then
if
ye
deny
this
matter
by
what
proof
do
you
believe
in
god
produce
your
proof
just
as
in
these
letters
to
christians
he
announces
the
fulfillment
of
the
gospel
promises
so
he
proclaims
also
to
muḥammadan
jews
zoroastrians
and
the
people
of
other
faiths
the
fulfillment
of
the
promises
of
their
holy
books
he
addresses
all
men
as
the
sheep
of
god
who
have
hitherto
been
divided
into
different
flocks
and
sheltered
in
different
folds
his
message
he
says
is
the
voice
of
god
the
good
shepherd
who
has
come
in
the
fullness
of
time
to
gather
his
scattered
sheep
into
one
flock
removing
the
barriers
between
them
that
there
may
be
one
fold
and
one
a
new
situation
the
position
of
bahá
u
lláh
among
the
prophets
is
unprecedented
and
unique
because
the
condition
of
the
world
at
the
time
of
his
advent
was
unprecedented
and
unique
by
a
long
and
checkered
process
of
development
in
religion
science
art
and
civilization
the
world
had
become
ripe
for
a
teaching
of
unity
the
barriers
which
in
previous
centuries
had
made
a
world
unity
impossible
were
ready
to
crumble
when
bahá
u
lláh
appeared
and
since
his
birth
in
and
more
especially
since
the
promulgation
of
his
teachings
began
these
barriers
have
been
breaking
down
in
most
astonishing
fashion
be
the
explanation
what
it
may
about
the
fact
there
can
be
no
doubt
in
the
days
of
previous
prophets
geographical
barriers
alone
were
amply
sufficient
to
prevent
world
unity
now
that
obstacle
has
been
overcome
for
the
first
time
in
human
history
men
on
opposite
sides
of
the
globe
are
able
to
communicate
with
each
other
quickly
and
easily
things
done
in
europe
yesterday
are
known
in
every
continent
of
the
world
today
and
a
speech
made
in
america
today
may
be
read
in
europe
asia
and
africa
tomorrow
another
great
obstacle
was
the
language
difficulty
thanks
to
the
study
and
teaching
of
foreign
languages
that
difficulty
has
already
been
to
a
large
extent
overcome
and
there
is
every
reason
to
suppose
that
ere
many
years
an
international
auxiliary
language
will
be
adopted
and
taught
in
all
the
schools
of
the
world
then
this
difficulty
also
will
be
completely
removed
the
third
great
obstacle
was
religious
prejudice
and
intolerance
that
too
is
disappearing
men
s
minds
are
becoming
more
open
the
education
of
the
people
is
passing
more
and
more
out
of
the
hands
of
sectarian
priests
and
new
and
more
liberal
ideas
can
no
longer
be
prevented
from
penetrating
into
even
the
most
exclusive
and
conservative
circles
bahá
u
lláh
is
thus
the
first
of
the
great
prophets
whose
message
has
become
known
within
a
period
of
comparatively
few
years
in
every
quarter
of
the
globe
within
a
short
time
the
essential
teachings
of
bahá
u
lláh
translated
from
his
own
authentic
writings
will
be
directly
accessible
to
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
world
who
is
able
to
read
fullness
of
the
bahá
í
revelation
the
bahá
í
revelation
is
unprecedented
and
unique
among
the
faiths
of
the
world
by
reason
of
the
fullness
and
completeness
of
its
authentic
records
the
recorded
words
that
can
with
certainty
be
attributed
to
christ
to
moses
to
zoroaster
to
buddha
to
krishna
are
very
few
and
leave
many
modern
questions
of
great
practical
importance
unanswered
many
of
the
teachings
commonly
attributed
to
these
religious
founders
are
of
doubtful
authenticity
and
some
are
evidently
accretions
of
later
date
the
muḥammadans
possess
in
the
qur
án
and
in
a
large
store
of
traditions
a
much
fuller
record
of
the
life
and
teachings
of
their
prophet
but
muḥammad
himself
though
inspired
was
illiterate
as
were
most
of
his
early
followers
the
methods
employed
for
recording
and
spreading
his
teachings
were
in
many
respects
unsatisfactory
and
the
authenticity
of
many
of
the
traditions
is
very
doubtful
as
a
result
differences
of
interpretation
and
conflicting
opinions
have
cause
divisions
and
dissensions
in
islam
as
in
all
previous
religious
communities
on
the
other
hand
both
the
báb
and
bahá
u
lláh
wrote
copiously
and
with
great
eloquence
and
power
as
both
were
debarred
from
public
speaking
and
spent
most
of
their
lives
after
the
declaration
of
their
mission
in
prison
they
devoted
a
large
proportion
of
their
time
to
writing
with
the
result
that
in
richness
of
authentic
scriptures
the
bahá
í
revelation
is
unapproached
by
any
of
its
predecessors
clear
and
full
expositions
are
given
of
many
truths
which
were
but
dimly
foreshadowed
in
previous
revelations
and
the
eternal
principles
of
truth
which
all
the
prophets
have
taught
have
been
applied
to
the
problems
which
are
facing
the
world
of
the
utmost
complexity
and
difficulty
many
of
which
had
not
arisen
in
the
days
of
former
prophets
it
is
evident
that
this
full
record
of
authentic
revelation
must
have
a
powerful
effect
in
preventing
misunderstandings
in
the
future
and
in
clearing
up
those
misunderstandings
of
the
past
which
have
kept
the
various
sects
asunder
the
bahá
í
covenant
the
bahá
í
revelation
is
unprecedented
and
unique
in
still
another
way
before
the
death
of
bahá
u
lláh
he
repeatedly
put
in
writing
a
covenant
appointing
his
eldest
son
abdu
whom
he
often
refers
to
as
the
branch
or
the
most
great
branch
as
the
authorized
interpreter
of
the
teachings
and
declaring
that
any
explanations
or
interpretations
given
by
him
are
to
be
accepted
as
of
equal
validity
with
the
words
of
bahá
u
lláh
himself
in
his
will
and
testament
he
says
consider
that
which
we
revealed
in
our
most
holy
book
when
the
ocean
of
my
presence
hath
ebbed
and
the
book
of
my
revelation
is
ended
turn
your
faces
toward
him
whom
god
hath
purposed
who
hath
branched
from
this
ancient
the
object
of
this
sacred
verse
is
none
other
except
the
most
mighty
branch
abdu
and
in
the
tablet
of
the
branch
in
which
he
explains
the
station
of
abdu
he
says
render
thanks
unto
god
o
people
for
his
appearance
for
verily
he
is
the
most
great
favor
unto
you
the
most
perfect
bounty
upon
you
and
through
him
every
mouldering
bone
is
quickened
whoso
turneth
towards
him
hath
turned
towards
god
and
whoso
turneth
away
from
him
hath
turned
away
from
my
beauty
hath
repudiated
my
proof
and
transgressed
against
me
after
the
death
of
bahá
u
lláh
abdu
had
abundant
opportunities
both
in
his
own
home
and
on
his
extensive
travels
of
meeting
people
from
all
parts
of
the
world
and
of
all
shades
of
opinion
he
heard
all
their
questions
their
difficulties
and
objections
and
gave
full
explanations
which
were
carefully
recorded
in
writing
during
a
long
series
of
years
abdu
continued
this
work
of
elucidating
the
teachings
and
showing
their
applications
to
the
most
varied
problems
of
modern
life
differences
of
opinion
which
have
arisen
among
believers
have
been
referred
to
him
and
authoritatively
settled
and
thus
the
risks
of
future
misunderstandings
have
been
further
reduced
bahá
u
lláh
further
arranged
that
an
international
house
of
justice
representative
of
all
bahá
ís
throughout
the
world
should
be
elected
to
take
charge
of
the
affairs
of
the
cause
control
and
coordinate
all
its
activities
prevent
divisions
and
schisms
elucidate
obscure
matters
and
preserve
the
teachings
from
corruption
and
misrepresentation
the
fact
that
this
supreme
administrative
body
can
not
only
initiate
legislation
on
all
matters
not
defined
in
the
teachings
but
also
annul
its
own
enactments
when
new
conditions
require
different
measures
enables
the
faith
to
expand
and
adapt
itself
like
a
living
organism
to
the
needs
and
requirements
of
a
changing
society
moreover
bahá
u
lláh
expressly
forbade
interpretation
of
the
teachings
by
anyone

and
testament
abdu

be
the

of

faith
after
him
and
to
be
empowered
to

or
more
years
another
manifestation
will
appear
under
the
shadow
of

with
clear
proofs
of
his
mission
but
until
then
the
words
of
bahá
u
lláh
abdu
and
the
guardian
and
the
decisions
of
the
international
house
of
justice
constitute
the
authorities
to
which
all
believers
must
turn
for
guidance
no
bahá
í
may
found
a
school
or
sect
based
on
any
particular
interpretation
of
the
teachings
or
any
supposed
divine
revelation
anyone
contravening
these
injunctions
is
considered
a
abdu
says
one
of
the
enemies
of
the
cause
is
he
who
endeavors
to
interpret
the
words
of
bahá
u
lláh
and
thereby
colors
the
meaning
according
to
his
capacity
and
collects
around
him
a
following
forming
a
different
sect
promoting
his
own
station
and
making
a
division
in
the
cause
in
another
tablet
he
writes
these
people
promoters
of
schism
are
like
the
froth
that
gathers
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
a
wave
will
surge
from
the
ocean
of
the
covenant
and
through
the
power
of
the
abhá
kingdom
will
cast
this
foam
ashore
these
corrupt
thoughts
that
emanate
from
personal
and
evil
intentions
will
all
vanish
whereas
the
covenant
of
god
shall
remain
stable
and
secure
there
is
nothing
to
keep
men
from
forsaking
religion
if
they
wish
to
do
so
abdu
says
god
himself
does
not
compel
the
soul
to
become
spiritual
the
exercise
of
the
free
human
will
is
the
spiritual
covenant
however
clearly
makes
sectarianism
within
the
bahá
í
community
quite
impossible
no
professional
priesthood
one
other
feature
of
the
bahá
í
organization
must
be
specially
mentioned
and
that
is
the
absence
of
a
professional
priesthood
voluntary
contributions
toward
the
expenses
of
teachers
are
permitted
and
many
devote
their
whole
time
to
work
for
the
cause
but
all
bahá
ís
are
expected
to
share
in
the
work
of
teaching
et
cetera
according
to
their
opportunity
and
ability
and
there
is
no
special
class
distinguished
from
their
fellow
believers
by
the
exclusive
exercise
of
priestly
functions
and
prerogatives
in
former
ages
priesthoods
were
necessary
because
people
were
illiterate
and
uneducated
and
were
dependent
on
priests
for
their
religious
instruction
for
the
conduct
of
religious
rites
and
ceremonies
for
the
administration
of
justice
et
cetera
now
however
times
have
changed
education
is
fast
becoming
universal
and
if
the
commands
of
bahá
u
lláh
are
carried
out
every
boy
and
girl
in
the
world
will
receive
a
sound
education
each
individual
will
then
be
able
to
study
the
scriptures
for
himself
to
draw
the
water
of
life
for
himself
direct
from
the
fountainhead
elaborate
rites
and
ceremonies
requiring
the
services
of
a
special
profession
or
caste
have
no
place
in
the
bahá
í
system
and
the
administration
of
justice
is
entrusted
to
the
authorities
instituted
for
that
purpose
for
a
child
a
teacher
is
necessary
but
the
aim
of
the
true
teacher
is
to
fit
his
pupil
to
do
without
a
teacher
to
see
things
with
his
own
eyes
hear
with
his
own
ears
and
understand
with
his
own
mind
just
so
in
the
childhood
of
the
race
the
priest
is
necessary
but
his
real
work
is
to
enable
men
to
do
without
him
to
see
things
divine
with
their
own
eyes
hear
them
with
their
own
ears
and
understand
them
with
their
own
minds
now
the
priest
s
work
is
all
but
accomplished
and
the
aim
of
the
bahá
í
teaching
is
to
complete
that
work
to
make
men
independent
of
all
save
god
so
that
they
can
turn
directly
to
him
that
is
to
his
manifestation
when
all
turn
to
one
center
then
there
can
be
no
or
confusion
and
the
nearer
all
draw
to
the
center
the
nearer
they
will
draw
to
each
other
chapter
true
civilization
o
people
of

be
not
occupied
with
yourselves
be
intent
on
the
betterment
of
the
world
and
the
training
of

religion
the
basis
of
civilization
according
to
the
bahá
í
view
the
problems
of
human
life
individual
and
social
are
so
inconceivably
complex
that
the
ordinary
human
intellect
is
incapable
of
itself
of
solving
them
aright
only
the
omniscient
fully
knows
the
purpose
of
creation
and
how
that
purpose
may
be
achieved
through
the
prophets
he
shows
to
mankind
the
true
goal
of
human
life
and
the
right
path
of
progress
and
the
building
up
of
a
true
civilization
depends
upon
faithful
adherence
to
the
guidance
of
prophetic
revelation
bahá
u
lláh
says
religion
is
the
greatest
instrument
for
the
order
of
the
world
and
the
tranquillity
of
all
existent
beings
the
weakening
of
the
pillars
of
religion
has
encouraged
the
ignorant
and
rendered
them
audacious
and
arrogant
truly
i
say
whatever
lowers
the
lofty
station
of
religion
will
increase
heedlessness
in
the
wicked
and
finally
result
in
anarchy
consider
the
civilization
of
the
people
of
the
it
has
occasioned
commotion
and
agitation
to
the
people
of
the
world
infernal
instruments
have
been
devised
and
such
atrocity
is
displayed
in
the
destruction
of
life
as
has
not
been
seen
by
the
eye
of
the
world
nor
heard
by
the
ear
of
nations
it
is
impossible
to
reform
these
violent
overwhelming
evils
except
the
peoples
of
the
world
become
united
upon
a
certain
issue
or
under
the
shadow
of
one
religion
o
people
of
bahá
each
one
of
the
revealed
commands
is
a
mighty
stronghold
for
the
protection
of
the
of
paradise
the
present
state
of
europe
and
of
the
world
in
general
eloquently
confirms
the
truth
of
these
words
written
so
many
years
ago
neglect
of
the
prophetic
commands
and
the
prevalence
of
irreligion
have
been
accompanied
by
disorder
and
destruction
on
the
most
terrible
scale
and
without
the
change
of
heart
and
aim
which
is
the
essential
characteristic
of
true
religion
the
reform
of
society
seems
an
utter
impossibility
justice
in
the
little
book
of
hidden
words
in
which
bahá
u
lláh
gives
in
brief
the
essence
of
the
prophetic
teachings
his
first
counsel

to
the
individual

a
pure
kindly

radiant
the
next
indicates
the
fundamental
principle
of
true
social
life
o
son
of

the
best
beloved
of
all
things
in
my
sight
is
justice
turn
not
away
therefrom
if
thou
desirest
me
and
neglect
it
not
that
i
may
confide
in
thee
by
its
aid
thou
shalt
see
with
thine
own
eyes
and
not
through
the
eyes
of
others
and
shalt
know
of
thine
own
knowledge
and
not
through
the
knowledge
of
thy
neighbor
ponder
this
in
thy
heart
how
it
behooveth
thee
to
be
verily
justice
is
my
gift
to
thee
and
the
sign
of
my
set
it
then
before
thine
eyes
the
first
essential
of
social
life
is
that
individuals
should
become
capable
of
discerning
the
true
from
the
false
and
right
from
wrong
and
of
seeing
things
in
their
true
proportions
the
greatest
cause
of
spiritual
and
social
blindness
and
the
greatest
foe
of
social
progress
is
selfishness
bahá

says
o
ye
sons
of
intelligence
the
thin
eye
lid
prevents
the
eye
from
seeing
the

and
what
is
contained
therein
then
think
of
the
result
when
the
curtain

covers
the
sight
of

the
darkness

tablet

long
experience
is
at
last
convincing
men
of
the
truth
of
the
prophetic
teaching
that
selfish
views
and
selfish
actions
inevitably
bring
social
disaster
and
that
if
humanity
is
not
to
perish
ingloriously
each
must
look
on
the
things
of
his
neighbor
as
of
equal
importance
with
his

and
subordinate
his

to
those
of

as

in
this
way
the
interests

bahá
u

says
o
son
of
man
if
thine
eyes
be
turned
towards
mercy
forsake
the
things
that
profit
thee
and
cleave
unto
that
which
will
profit
mankind
and

for

government
the
teachings
of
bahá
u
lláh
contain
two
different
types
of
reference
to
the
question
of
true
social
order
one
type
is
exemplified
in
the
tablets
revealed
to
the
kings
which
deal
with
the
problem
of
government
as
existing
in
the
world
during
bahá
u
lláh
s
life
on
earth
the
other
references
are
to
the
new
order
to
be
developed
within
the
bahá
í
community
itself
hence
arises
the
sharp
contrast
between
such
passages
as
the
one
true
god
exalted
be
his
glory
hath
ever
regarded
and
will
continue
to
regard
the
hearts
of
men
as
his
own
his
exclusive
possession
all
else
whether
pertaining
to
land
or
sea
whether
riches
or
glory
he
hath
bequeathed
unto
the
kings
and
rulers
of
the
earth
and
it
beseemeth
all
men
in
this
day
to
take
firm
hold
on
the
most
great
name
and
to
establish
the
unity
of
all
mankind
there
is
no
place
to
flee
to
no
refuge
that
any
one
can
seek
except
from
the
writings
of
bahá
u
lláh
pp
the
apparent
incompatibility
of
these
two
views
is
removed
when
we
observe
the
distinction
which
bahá
u
lláh
makes
between
the
lesser
peace
and
the
most
great
in
his
tablets
to
the
kings
bahá
u
lláh
called
upon
them
to
assemble
and
take
measures
for
the
maintenance
of
political
peace
the
reduction
of
armaments
and
the
removal
of
the
burdens
and
insecurity
of
the
poor
but
his
words
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
their
failure
to
respond
to
the
needs
of
the
time
would
result
in
wars
and
revolutions
leading
to
the
overthrow
of
the
old
order
therefore
on
the
one
hand
he
said
what
mankind
needeth
in
this
day
is
obedience
unto
them
that
are
in
authority
and
on
the
other
those
men
who
having
amassed
the
vanities
and
ornaments
of
the
earth
have
turned
away
disdainfully
from
have
lost
both
this
world
and
the
world
to
come
ere
long
will
god
with
the
hand
of
power
strip
them
of
their
possessions
and
divest
them
of
the
robe
of
his
we
have
a
fixed
time
for
you
o
peoples
if
ye
fail
at
the
appointed
hour
to
turn
towards
god
he
verily
will
lay
violent
hold
on
you
and
will
cause
grievous
afflictions
to
assail
you
from
every
the
signs
of
impending
convulsions
and
chaos
can
now
be
discerned
inasmuch
as
the
prevailing
order
appeareth
to
be
lamentably
we
have
pledged
ourselves
to
secure
thy
triumph
upon
earth
and
to
exalt
our
cause
above
all
men
though
no
king
be
found
who
would
turn
his
face
towards
gleanings
from
the
writings
of
bahá
u
lláh
pp
the
great
being
wishing
to
reveal
the
prerequisites
of
the
peace
and
tranquillity
of
the
world
and
the
advancement
of
its
peoples
hath
written
the
time
must
come
when
the
imperative
necessity
for
the
holding
of
a
vast
an
assemblage
of
men
will
be
universally
realized
the
rulers
and
kings
of
the
earth
must
needs
attend
it
and
participating
in
its
deliberations
must
consider
such
ways
and
means
as
will
lay
the
foundations
of
the
world
s
great
peace
amongst
men
such
a
peace
demandeth
that
the
great
powers
should
resolve
for
the
sake
of
the
tranquillity
of
the
peoples
of
the
earth
to
be
fully
reconciled
among
themselves
should
any
kind
take
up

against

all
should
unitedly
arise
and
prevent
from
the
writings

by
such
counsel
bahá

revealed
the
conditions
under
which
public
responsibility
must
be
discharged
in
this
day
of
god
appealing
for
international
solidarity
on
the
one
hand
he
no
less
clearly
warned
the
rulers
that
continuance
of
strife
would
destroy
their
power
now
modern
history
confirms
this
warning
in
the
rise
of
those
coercive
movements
which
in
all
civilized
nations
have
attained
such
destructive
energy
and
in
the
development
of
warfare
to
the
degree
that
victory
is
no
longer
attainable
by
any
party
now
that
ye
have
refused
the
most
great
peace
hold
ye
fast
unto
this
the
lesser
peace
that
haply
ye
may
in
some
degree
better
your
own
condition
and
that
of
your
that
which
the
lord
hath
ordained
as
the
sovereign
remedy
and
mightiest
instrument
for
the
healing
of
all
the
world
is
the
union
of
all
its
peoples
in
one
universal
cause
one
common
faith
this
can
in
no
wise
be
achieved
except
through
the
power
of
a
skilled
an
and
inspired
from
the
writings
of
bahá
u
lláh
pp
by
the
lesser
peace
is
meant
a
political
unity
of
states
while
the
most
great
peace
is
a
unity
embracing
spiritual
as
well
as
political
and
economic
factors
soon
will
the
order
be
rolled
up
and
a
new
one
spread
out
in
its
from
the
writings
of
bahá
u
lláh
in
former
ages
a
government
could
concern
itself
with
external
matters
and
material
affairs
but
today
the
function
of
government
demands
a
quality
of
leadership
of
consecration
and
of
spiritual
knowledge
impossible
save
to
those
who
have
turned
to
god
political
freedom
although
advocating
as
the
ideal
condition
a
representative
form
of
government
local
national
and
international
bahá
u
lláh
teaches
that
this
is
possible
only
when
men
have
attained
a
sufficiently
high
degree
of
individual
and
social
development
suddenly
to
grant
full
to
people
without
education
who
are
dominated
by
selfish
desires
and
are
inexperienced
in
the
conduct
of
public
affairs
would
be
disastrous
there
is
nothing
more
dangerous
than
freedom
for
those
who
are
not
fit
to
use
it
wisely
bahá
u
lláh
writes
in
the
book
of
aqdas
consider
the
pettiness
of
men
s
minds
they
ask
for
that
which
injureth
them
and
cast
away
the
thing
that
profiteth
them
they
are
indeed
of
those
that
are
far
astray
we
find
some
men
desiring
liberty
and
priding
themselves
therein
such
men
are
in
the
depths
of
ignorance
liberty
must
in
the
end
lead
to
sedition
whose
flames
none
can
quench
thus
warneth
you
he
who
is
the
reckoner
the
know
ye
that
the
embodiment
of
liberty
and
its
symbol
is
the
animal
that
which
beseemeth
man
is
submission
unto
such
restraints
as
will
protect
him
from
his
own
ignorance
and
guard
him
against
the
harm
of
the
liberty
causeth
man
to
overstep
the
bounds
of
propriety
and
to
infringe
on
the
dignity
of
his
station
it
debaseth
him
to
the
level
of
extreme
depravity
and
wickedness
regard
men
as
a
flock
of
sheep
that
need
a
shepherd
for
their
protection
this
verily
is
the
truth
the
certain
truth
we
approve
of
liberty
in
certain
circumstances
and
refuse
to
sanction
it
in
others
we
verily
are
the
say
true
liberty
consisteth
in
man
s
submission
unto
my
commandments
little
as
ye
know
it
were
men
to
observe
that
which
we
have
sent
down
unto
them
from
the
heaven
of
revelation
they
would
of
a
certainty
attain
unto
perfect
liberty
happy

that
hath
apprehended
the
purpose
of
god
in
whatever
he
hath
revealed
from
the
heaven
of
his
will
that
pervadeth
all
created
things
say
the
liberty
that
profiteth
you
is
to
be
found
nowhere
except
in
complete
servitude
unto
god
the
eternal
truth
whoso
hath
tasted
of
its
sweetness
will
refuse
to
barter
it
for
all
the
dominion
of
earth
and
for
improving
the
condition
of
backward
races
and
nations
the
divine
teachings
are
the
sovereign
remedy
when
both
people
and
statesmen
learn
and
adopt
these
teachings
the
nations
will
be
freed
from
all
their
bonds

bahá
u

forbids
tyranny
and
oppression
in
the
most
emphatic
terms
in
hidden
words

writes
o
oppressors
of

withdraw
your
hands
from
tyranny
for
i
have
pledged
myself
not
to
forgive

injustice
this

preserved
tablet
and
sealed
it
with
my
seal
of
glory
those
entrusted
with
the
framing
and
administration
of
laws
and
regulations
must
hold
fast
to
the
rope
of
consultation
and
decide
upon
and
execute
that
which
is
conducive
to
the
people
s
security
affluence
welfare
and
tranquillity
for
if
matters
be
arranged
otherwise
it
will
lead
to
discord
and
of
the
world
on
the
other
hand
the
people
must
be
and
loyal
to
the
just
government
they
must
rely
on
educational
methods
and
on
the
force
of
good
example
not
on
violence
for
bringing
about
a
better
state
of
affairs
in
the
nation
bahá
u
lláh
says
in
every
country
where
any
of
this
community
reside
they
must
behave
toward
the
government
of
that
country
with
faithfulness
truthfulness
and
tidings
o
people
of
god
adorn
your
temples
with
the
mantle
of
trustworthiness
and
integrity
then
assist
your
lord
with
the
hosts
of
good
deeds
and
good
morals
verily
we
have
forbidden
you
sedition
and
strife
in
my
books
and
epistles
in
my
writings
and
tablets
and
by
this
we
have
desired
only
your
loftiness
and
of
appointment
and
promotion
in
making
appointments
the
only
criterion
must
be
fitness
for
the
position
before
this
paramount
consideration
all
others
such
as
seniority
social
or
financial
status
family
connection
or
personal
friendship
must
give
way
bahá
u
lláh
says
in
the
tablet
of
the
fifth
effulgence
is
the
knowledge
by
governments
of
the
condition
of
the
governed
and
the
conferring
of
ranks
according
to
desert
and
merit
regard
to
this
matter
is
strictly
enjoined
upon
every
chief
and
ruler
that
haply
traitors
may
not
usurp
the
positions
of
trustworthy
men
nor
spoilers
occupy
the
seats
of
guardians
it
needs
but
little
consideration
to
show
that
when
this
principle
becomes
generally
accepted
and
acted
upon
the
transformation
in
our
social
life
will
be
astounding
when
each
individual
is
given
the
position
for
which
his
talents
and
capabilities
specially
fit
him
he
will
be
able
to
put
his
heart
into
his
work
and
become
an
artist
in
his
profession
with
incalculable
benefit
to
himself
and
the
rest
of
the
world
economic
problems
the
bahá
í
teachings
insist
in
the
strongest
terms
on
the
need
for
reform
in
the
economic
relations
of
rich
and
poor
abdu
says
the
arrangements
of
the
circumstances
of
the
people
must
be
such
that
poverty
shall
disappear
that
everyone
as
far
as
possible
according
to
his
rank
and
position
shall
share
in
comfort
and
we
see
among
us
men
who
are
overburdened
with
riches
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
those
unfortunate
ones
who
starve
with
nothing
those
who
possess
several
stately
palaces
and
those
who
have
not
where
to
lay
their
head
this
condition
of
affairs
is
wrong
and
must
be
remedied
now
the
remedy
must
be
carefully
undertaken
it
can
not
be
done
by
bringing
to
pass
absolute
equality
between
men
equality
is
a
chimera
it
is
entirely
impracticable
even
if
equality
could
be
achieved
it
could
not
continue
and
if
its
existence
were
possible
the
whole
order
of
the
world
would
be
destroyed
the
law
of
order
must
always
obtain
in
the
world
of
humanity
heaven
has
so
decreed
in
the
creation
of
man
humanity
like
a
great
army
requires
a
general
captains
underofficers
in
their
degree
and
soldiers
each
with
their
appointed
duties
degrees
are
absolutely
necessary
to
ensure
an
orderly
organization
an
army
could
not
be
composed
of
generals
alone
or
of
captains
only
or
of
nothing
but
soldiers
without
anyone
in
authority
certainly
some
being
enormously
rich
and
other
lamentably
poor
an
organization
is
necessary
to
control
and
improve
this
state
of
affairs
it
is
important
to
limit
riches
as
it
is
also
of
importance
to
limit
poverty
either
extreme
is
not
good
when
we
see
poverty
allowed
to
reach
a
condition
of
starvation
it
is
a
sure
sign
that
somewhere
we
shall
find
tyranny
men
must
bestir
themselves
in
this
matter
and
no
longer
delay
in
altering
conditions
which
bring
the
misery
of
grinding
poverty
to
a
very
large
number
of
people
the
rich
must
give
of
their
abundance
they
must
soften
their
hearts
and
cultivate
a
compassionate
intelligence
taking
thought
for
those
sad
ones
who
are
suffering
from
lack
of
the
very
necessaries
of
life
there
must
be
special
laws
made
dealing
with
these
extremes
of
rich
and
want
the
government
of
the
countries
should
conform
to
the
divine
law
which
gives
equal
justice
to
all
not
until
this
is
done
will
the
law
of
god
be
obeyed
public
finance
abdu
suggests
that
each
town
and
village
or
district
should
be
entrusted
as
far
as
possible
with
the
administration
of
fiscal
matters
within
its
own
area
and
should
contribute
its
due
proportion
for
the
expenses
of
the
general
government
one
of
the
principal
sources
of
revenue
should
be
a
graduated
income
tax
if
a
man
s
income
does
not
exceed
his
necessary
expenditure
he
should
not
be
required
to
pay
any
tax
but
in
all
cases
where
income
exceeds
the
necessary
expenditure
a
tax
should
be
levied
the
percentage
of
tax
increasing
as
the
surplus
of
income
over
necessary
expenditure
increases
on
the
other
hand
if
a
person
through
illness
poor
crops
or
other
cause
for
which
he
is
not
responsible
is
unable
to
earn
an
income
sufficient
to
meet
his
necessary
expenses
for
the
year
then
what
he
lacks
for
the
maintenance
of
himself
and
his
family
should
be
supplied
out
of
public
funds
there
will
also
be
other
sources
of
public
revenue
from
intestate
estates
mines
treasure
trove
and
voluntary
contributions
while
among
the
expenditures
will
be
grants
for
the
support
of
the
infirm
of
orphans
of
schools
of
the
deaf
and
blind
and
for
the
maintenance
of
public
health
thus
the
welfare
and
comfort
of
all
will
be
provided
for
voluntary
sharing
in
a
letter
to
the
central
organization
for
a
durable
peace
written
in
abdu
says
among
the
teachings
of
bahá
u
lláh
is
voluntary
sharing
of
one
s
property
with
others
among
mankind
this
voluntary
sharing
is
greater
than
legally
imposed
equality
and
consists
in
this
that
one
should
not
prefer
oneself
to
others
but
rather
should
sacrifice
one
s
life
and
property
for
others
but
this
should
not
be
introduced
by
coercion
so
that
it
becomes
a
law
which
man
is
compelled
to
follow
nay
rather
man
should
voluntarily
and
of
his
own
choice
sacrifice
his
property
and
life
for
others
and
spend
willingly
for
the
poor
just
as
is
done
in
persia
among
the
bahá
ís
work
for
all
one
of
the
most
important
instructions
of
bahá
u
lláh
in
regard
to
the
economic
question
is
that
all
must
engage
in
useful
work
there
must
be
no
drones
in
the
social
hive
no
parasites
on
society
he
says
it
is
enjoined
on
every
one
of
you
to
engage
in
some
art
trade
or
the
like
we
have
made
with
the
worship
of
god
the
true
one
reflect
o
people
upon
the
mercy
of
god
and
upon
his
favors
then
thank
him
in
the
mornings
and
evenings
waste
not
your
time
in
idleness
and
indolence
and
occupy
yourselves
with
that
which
will
profit
yourselves
and
others
beside
yourselves
thus
hath
the
matter
been
decreed
in
this
tablet
from
the
horizon
of
which
the
sun
of
wisdom
and
divine
utterance
is
gleaming
the
most
despised
of
men
before
is
he
who
sits
and
begs
cling
unto
the
rope
of
means
relying
upon
god
the
causer
of
tidings
how
much
of
the
energy
employed
in
the
business
world
of
today
is
expended
simply
in
canceling
and
neutralizing
the
efforts
of
other
useless
strife
and
competition
and
how
much
in
ways
that
are
still
more
injurious
were
all
to
work
and
were
all
work
whether
of
brain
or
hand
of
a
nature
profitable
to
mankind
as
bahá
u
lláh
commands
then
the
supplies
of
everything
necessary
for
a
healthy
comfortable
and
noble
life
would
amply
suffice
for
all
there
need
be
no
slums
no
starvation
no
destitution
no
industrial
slavery
no
drudgery
the
ethics
of
wealth
according
to
the
bahá
í
teachings
riches
rightly
acquired
and
rightly
used
are
honorable
and
praiseworthy
services
rendered
should
be
adequately
rewarded
bahá
u
lláh
says
in
the
tablet
of
tarazát
the
people
of
baha
must
not
refuse
to
discharge
the
due
reward
of
anyone
and
must
respect
possessors
of
talent
one
must
speak
with
justice
and
recognize
the
worth
of
with
regard
to
interest
on
money
bahá
u
lláh
writes
in
the
tablet
of
as
follows
most
of
the
people
are
found
to
be
in
need
of
this
matter
for
if
no
interest
be
allowed
affairs
business
will
be
trammeled
and
obstructed
a
person
is
rarely
found
who
would
lend
money
to
anyone
upon
the
principle
of
literally
good
loan
money
advanced
without
interest
and
repaid
at
the
pleasure
of
the
borrower
consequently
out
of
favor
to
the
servants
we
have
appointed
profit
on
money
to
be
current
among
other
business
transactions
which
are
in
force
among
people
that
is
it
is
allowable
lawful
and
pure
to
charge
interest
on
money
but
this
matter
must
be
conducted
with
moderation
and
justice
the
pen
of
glory
has
withheld
itself
from
laying
down
its
limits
as
a
wisdom
from
his
presence
and
as
a
convenience
for
his
servants
we
exhort
the
friends
of
god
to
act
with
fairness
and
justice
and
in
such
a
way
that
the
mercy
of
his
beloved
ones
and
their
compassion
may
be
manifested
toward
each
other
the
execution
of
these
matters
has
been
placed
in
charge
of
the
men
of
the
house
of
justice
in
order
that
they
may
act
in
accordance
with
the
exigencies
of
the
time
and
with
wisdom
no
industrial
slavery
in
the
book
of
aqdas
bahá
u
lláh
forbids
slavery
and
abdu
has
explained
that
not
only
chattel
slavery
but
also
industrial
slavery
is
contrary
to
the
law
of
god
when
in
the
united
states
in
he
said
to
the
american
people
between
and
you
did
a
wonderful
thing
you
abolished
chattel
slavery
but
today
you
must
do
a
much
more
wonderful
thing
you
must
abolish
industrial
slavery
the
solution
of
economic
questions
will
not
be
brought
about
by
array
of
capital
against
labor
and
labor
against
capital
in
strife
and
conflict
but
by
the
voluntary
attitude
of
goodwill
on
both
sides
then
a
real
and
lasting
justness
of
conditions
will
be
secured
among
the
bahá
ís
there
are
no
extortionate
mercenary
and
unjust
practices
no
rebellious
demands
no
revolutionary
uprisings
against
existing
governments
it
will
not
be
possible
in
the
future
for
men
to
amass
great
fortunes
by
the
labors
of
others
the
rich
will
willingly
divide
they
will
come
to
this
gradually
naturally
by
their
own
volition
it
will
never
be
accomplished
by
war
and
bloodshed
it
is
by
friendly
consultation
and
cooperation
by
just
copartnership
and
that
the
interests
of
both
capital
and
labor
will
be
best
served
the
harsh
weapons
of
the
strike
and
lockout
are
injurious
not
only
to
the
trades
immediately
affected
but
to
the
community
as
a
whole
it
is
therefore
the
business
of
the
governments
to
devise
means
for
preventing
recourse
to
such
barbarous
methods
of
settling
disputes
abdu
said
at
dublin
new
hampshire
in
now
i
want
to
tell
you
about
the
law
of
god
according
to
the
divine
law
employees
should
not
be
paid
merely
by
wages
nay
rather
they
should
be
partners
in
every
work
the
question
of
socialization
is
very
difficult
it
will
not
be
solved
by
strikes
for
wages
all
the
governments
of
the
world
must
be
united
and
organize
an
assembly
the
members
of
which
shall
be
elected
from
the
parliaments
and
the
noble
ones
of
the
nations
these
must
plan
with
wisdom
and
power
so
that
neither
the
capitalists
suffer
enormous
losses
nor
the
laborers
become
needy
in
the
utmost
moderation
they
should
make
the
law
then
announce
to
the
public
that
the
rights
of
the
working
people
are
to
be
effectively
preserved
also
the
rights
of
the
capitalists
are
to
be
protected
when
such
a
general
law
is
adopted
by
the
will
of
both
sides
should
a
strike
occur
all
the
governments
of
the
world
should
collectively
resist
it
otherwise
the
work
will
lead
to
much
destruction
especially
in
europe
terrible
things
will
take
place
one
of
the
several
causes
of
a
universal
european
war
will
be
this
question
the
owners
of
properties
mines
and
factories
should
share
their
incomes
with
their
employees
and
give
a
fairly
certain
percentage
of
their
profits
to
their
workingmen
in
order
that
the
employees
should
receive
besides
their
wages
some
of
the
general
income
of
the
factory
so
that
the
employee
may
strive
with
his
soul
in
the
work
bequest
and
inheritance
bahá
u
lláh
states
that
a
person
should
be
free
to
dispose
of
his
possessions
during
his
lifetime
in
any
way
he
chooses
and
it
is
incumbent
on
everyone
to
write
a
will
stating
how
his
property
is
to
be
disposed
of
after
his
death
when
a
person
dies
without
leaving
a
will
the
value
of
the
property
should
be
estimated
and
divided
in
certain
state
proportions
among
seven
classes
of
inheritors
namely
children
wife
or
husband
father
mother
brothers
sisters
and
teachers
the
share
of
each
diminishing
from
the
first
to
the
last
in
the
absence
of
one
or
more
of
these
classes
the
share
which
would
belong
to
them
goes
to
the
public
treasury
to
be
expended
on
the
poor
the
fatherless
and
the
widows
or
on
useful
public
works
if
the
deceased
has
no
heirs
then
all
his
property
goes
to
the
public
treasury
there
is
nothing
in
the
law
of
bahá
u
lláh
to
prevent
a
man
from
leaving
all
his
property
to
one
individual
if
he
pleases
but
bahá
ís
will
naturally
be
influenced
in
making
their
wills
by
the
model
bahá
u
lláh
has
laid
down
for
the
case
of
intestate
estates
which
ensures
distribution
of
property
among
a
considerable
number
of
heirs
equality
of
men
and
women
one
of
the
social
principles
to
which
bahá
u
lláh
attaches
great
importance
is
that
women
should
be
regarded
as
the
equals
of
men
and
should
enjoy
equal
rights
and
privileges
equal
education
and
equal
opportunities
the
great
means
on
which
he
relies
for
bringing
about
the
emancipation
of
women
is
universal
education
girls
are
to
receive
as
good
an
education
as
boys
in
fact
the
education
of
girls
is
even
more
important
than
that
of
boys
for
in
time
these
girls
will
become
mothers
and
as
mothers
they
will
be
the
first
teachers
of
the
next
generation
children
are
like
green
and
tender
branches
if
the
early
training
is
right
they
grow
straight
and
if
it
is
wrong
they
grow
crooked
and
to
the
end
of
their
lives
they
are
affected
by
the
training
of
their
earliest
years
how
important
then
that
girls
should
be
well
and
wisely
educated
during
his
western
tours
abdu
had
frequent
occasion
to
explain
the
bahá
í
teachings
on
this
subject
at
a
meeting
of
the
women
s
freedom
league
in
london
in
january
he
said
humanity
is
like
a
bird
with
its
two
one
is
male
the
other
female
unless
both
wings
are
strong
and
impelled
by
some
common
force
the
bird
can
not
fly
heavenwards
according
to
the
spirit
of
this
age
women
must
advance
and
fulfill
their
mission
in
all
departments
of
life
becoming
equal
to
men
they
must
be
on
the
same
level
as
men
and
enjoy
equal
rights
this
is
my
earnest
prayer
and
it
is
one
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
bahá
u
lláh
some
scientists
have
declared
that
the
brains
of
men
weigh
more
than
those
of
women
and
claim
this
as
a
proof
of
man
s
superiority
yet
when
we
look
around
us
we
see
people
with
small
heads
whose
brains
much
weigh
little
who
show
the
greatest
intelligence
and
great
powers
of
understanding
and
others
with
big
heads
whose
brains
must
be
heavy
and
yet
they
are
witless
therefore
the
avoirdupois
of
the
brain
is
no
true
measure
of
intelligence
or
superiority
when
men
bring
forward
as
a
second
proof
of
their
superiority
the
assertion
that
women
have
not
achieved
as
much
as
men
they
use
poor
arguments
which
leave
history
out
of
consideration
if
they
kept
themselves
more
fully
informed
historically
they
would
know
that
great
women
have
lived
and
achieved
great
things
in
the
past
and
that
there
are
many
living
and
achieving
great
things

the
achievements
of
zenobia

great
women
of
the

the
daughter
of
a
muḥammadan
priest
at
the
time
of
the
appearance
of
the
báb
she
showed
such
tremendous
courage
and
power
that
all
who
heard
her
were
astonished
she
threw
aside
her
veil
despite
the
immemorial
custom
of
the
women
of
persia
and
although
it
was
considered
impolite
to
speak
with
men
this
heroic
woman
carried
on
controversies
with
the
most
learned
men
and
in
every
meeting
she
vanquished
them
the
persian
government
took
her
prisoner
she
was
stoned
in
the
streets
anathematized
exiled
from
town
to
town
threatened
with
death
but
she
never
failed
in
her
determination
to
work
for
the
freedom
of
her
sisters
she
bore
persecution
and
suffering
with
the
greatest
heroism
even
in
prison
she
gained
converts
to
a
minister
in
persia
in
whose
house
she
was
imprisoned
she
said
you
can
kill
me
as
soon
as
you
like
but
you
can
not
stop
the
emancipation
of
at
last
the
end
of
her
tragic
life
came
she
was
carried
into
a
garden
and
strangled
she
put
on
however
her
choicest
robes
as
if
she
were
going
to
join
a
bridal
party
with
such
magnanimity
and
courage
she
gave
her
life
startling
and
thrilling
all
who
saw
her
she
was
truly
a
great
heroine
today
in
persia
among
the
bahá
ís
there
are
women
who
also
show
unflinching
courage
and
who
are
endowed
with
great
poetic
insight
they
are
most
eloquent
and
speak
before
large
gatherings
of
people
women
must
go
on
advancing
they
must
extend
their
knowledge
of
science
literature
history
for
the
perfection
of
humanity
erelong
they
will
receive
their
rights
men
will
see
women
in
earnest
bearing
themselves
with
dignity
improving
the
civil
and
political
life
opposed
to
warfare
demanding
suffrage
and
equal
opportunities
i
expect
to
see
you
advance
in
all
phases
of
life
then
will
your
brows
be
crowned
with
the
diadem
of
eternal
glory
women
and
the
new
age
when
woman
s
point
of
view
receives
due
consideration
and
woman
s
will
is
allowed
adequate
expression
in
the
arrangement
of
social
affairs
we
may
expect
great
advancement
in
matters
which
have
often
be
grievously
neglected
under
the
old
regime
of
male
matters
as
health
temperance
peace
and
regard
for
the
value
of
the
individual
life
improvements
in
these
respects
will
have
very
and
beneficent
effects
abdu
says
the
world
in
the
past
has
been
ruled
by
force
and
man
has
dominated
over
woman
by
reason
of
his
more
forceful
and
aggressive
qualities
both
of
body
and
mind
but
the
balance
is
already
shifting
force
is
losing
its
dominance
and
mental
alertness
intuition
and
the
spiritual
qualities
of
love
and
service
in
which
woman
is
strong
are
gaining
ascendancy
hence
the
new
age
will
be
an
age
less
masculine
and
more
permeated
with
the
feminine
ideals
or
to
speak
more
exactly
will
be
an
age
in
which
the
masculine
and
feminine
elements
of
civilization
will
be
more
evenly

counsels
his
followers
to
avoid
methods
of
violence
an
excellent
illustration
of
the
bahá
í
method
of
social
reform
has
been
given
by
the
bahá
í
in
persia
egypt
and
syria
in
these
countries
it
is
customary
for
muḥammadan
women
outside
their
homes
to
wear
a
veil
covering
the
face
the
báb
indicated
that
in
the
new
dispensation
women
would
be
relieved
from
this
irksome
restraint
but
bahá
u
lláh
counsels
his
followers
where
no
important
question
of
morality
is
involved
to
defer
to
established
customs
until
people
become
enlightened
rather
than
scandalize
those
amongst
whom
they
live
and
arouse
needless
antagonism
the
bahá

women
therefore
although
well
aware
that
the
antiquated
custom
of
wearing
the
veil
is
for
enlightened
people
unnecessary
and
inconvenient
yet
quietly
put
up
with
the
inconvenience
rather
than
rouse
a
storm
of
fanatical
hatred
and
rancorous
opposition
by
uncovering
their
faces
in
public
this
conformity
to
custom
is
in
no
way
due
to
fear
but
to
an
assured
confidence
in
the
power
of
education

the

aim
of
all
the
holy
prophets
since
the
world
began
and
in
the
bahá

teachings
the
fundamental
importance
and
limitless
possibilities
of
education
are
proclaimed
in
the
clearest
terms
the
teacher
is
the
most
potent
factor
in

and
his
work
is
the
highest
to
which
men
can
aspire
education
begins
in
the
mother
s
womb
and
is
as
unending
as
the
life
of
the
individual
it
is
a
perennial
necessity
of
right
living
and
the
foundation
of
both
individual
and
social
welfare
when

false

wrong

erroneous

drilled
into

from

how
few
are
taught
from

earliest
childhood
to
love
god
with
all
their
hearts
and
dedicate
their
lives
to
him
to
regard
service
to
humanity
as
the
highest
aim
in
life
to
develop
their
powers
to
the
best
advantage
for
the
general
good
of
all
yet
surely
these
are
the
essential
elements
of
a
good
education
mere
cramming
of
the
memory
with
facts
about
arithmetic
grammar
geography
languages
has
comparatively
little
effect
in
producing
noble
and
useful
lives
bahá
u
lláh
says
that
education
must
be
universal
it
is
decreed
that
every
father
must
educate
his
sons
and
daughters
in
learning
and
in
writing
and
also
in
that
which
hath
been
ordained
in
the
tablet
he
who
neglects
that
which
hath
been
commanded
in
this
matter
if
he
be
rich
it
is
incumbent
on
the
trustees
of
the
house
of
justice
to
recover
from
him
the
amount
required
for
the
education
of
his
children
otherwise
if
the
parent
be
not
capable
the
matter
shall
devolve
upon
the
house
of
justice
verily
we
have
made
it
the
house
of
justice
an
asylum
for
the
poor
and
needy
he
who
educates
his
son
or
any
other
children
it
is
as
though
he
hath
educated
one
of
my
of
men
and
women
must
place
a
part
of
what
they
earn
by
trade
agriculture
or
other
business
in
charge
of
a
trustworthy
person
to
be
spent
in
the
education
and
instruction
of
the
children
that
deposit
must
be
invested
in
the
education
of
the
children
under
the
advice
of
the
trustees
or
members
of
the
house
of
of
the
world
innate
differences
of
nature
in
the
bahá
í
view
the
child
s
nature
is
not
like
so
much
wax
that
can
be
molded
indifferently
to
any
shape
according
to
the
will
of
the
teacher
nay
each
from
the
first
has
his
own
character
and
individuality
which
can
develop
to
the
best
advantage
only
in
a
particular
way
and
that
way
in
each
case
is
unique
no
two
people
have
exactly
the
same
capabilities
and
talents
and
the
true
educator
will
never
attempt
to
force
two
natures
into
the
same
mold
in
fact
he
will
never
attempt
to
force
any
nature
into
any
mold
rather
he
will
reverently
tend
the
developing
powers
of
the
young
nature
encourage
and
protect
them
and
supply
the
nourishment
and
assistance
which
they
need
his
work
is
like
that
of
a
gardener
tending
different
plants
one
plant
likes
the
bright
sunshine
another
the
cool
shade
one
loves
the
water
s
edge
and
another
the
dry
knoll
one
thrives
best
on
sandy
soil
and
another
on
rich
loam
each
must
have
its
needs
appropriately
supplied
else
its
perfections
can
never
be
fully
revealed
abdu
says
the
prophets
acknowledge
that
education
hath
a
great
effect
upon
the
human
race
but
they
declare
that
minds
and
comprehensions
are
originally
different
we
see
that
certain
children
of
the
same
age
nativity
and
race
nay
from
the
same
household
under
the
tutorship
of
the
same
teacher
differ
in
minds
and
comprehensions
no
matter
how
the
shell
is
educated
or
polished
it
can
never
become
the
radiant
pearl
the
black
stone
will
not
become
the
gem
the
thorny
cactus
can
never
by
training
and
development
become
the
blessed
tree
that
is
to
say
training
doth
not
change
the
essential
nature
of
the
human
gem
but
it
produceth
a
marvelous
effect
by
this
effective
power
all
that
is
latent
of
virtues
and
capacities
in
the
human
reality
will
be
revealed
character
training
the
thing
of
paramount
importance
in
education
is
character
training
with
regard
to
this
example
is
more
effective
than
precept
and
the
lives
and
characters
of
the
child
s
parents
teachers
and
habitual
associates
are
factors
of
the
utmost
importance
the
prophets
of
god
are
the
great
educators
of
mankind
and
their
counsels
and
the
story
of
their
lives
should
be
instilled
into
the
child
s
mind
as
soon
as
it
is
able
to
grasp
them
especially
important
are
the
words
of
the
supreme
teacher
bahá
u
lláh
who
reveals
the
root
principles
on
which
the
civilization
of
the
future
must
be
built
up
he
says
teach
your
children
what
hath
been
revealed
through
the
pen
of
glory
instruct
them
in
what
hath
descended
from
the
heaven
of
greatness
and
power
let
them
memorize
the
tablets
of
the
merciful
and
chant
them
with
the
most
melodious
voices
in
the
halls
of
the
arts
sciences
and
crafts
training
in
arts
sciences
crafts
and
useful
professions
is
regarded
as
important
and
necessary
bahá
u
lláh
says
knowledge
is
like
unto
wings
for
the
being
of
man
and
is
like
a
ladder
for
ascending
to
acquire
knowledge
is
incumbent
upon
all
but
of
those
sciences
which
may
profit
the
people
of
the
earth
and
not
such
sciences
as
being
in
mere
words
and
end
in
mere
words
the
possessors
of
sciences
and
arts
have
a
great
right
among
the
people
of
the
world
indeed
the
real
treasury
of
man
is
his
knowledge
knowledge
is
the
means
of
honor
prosperity
joy
gladness
happiness
and
of
tajallíyát
treatment
of
criminals
in
a
talk
on
the
right
method
of
treating
criminals
abdu
spoke
as
follows
the
most
essential
thing
is
that
the
people
must
be
educated
in
such
a
way
that
they
will
avoid
and
shrink
from
perpetrating
crimes
so
that
the
crime
itself
will
appear
to
them
as
the
greatest
chastisement
the
utmost
condemnation
and
torment
therefore
no
crimes
which
require
punishment
will
be
committed
if
someone
oppresses
injures
and
wrongs
another
and
the
wronged
man
retaliates
this
is
vengeance
and
is
censurable
if
amr
dishonours
zaid
the
latter
has
not
the
right
to
dishonour
amr
if
he
does
so
this
is
vengeance
and
is
very
reprehensible
no
rather
he
must
return
good
for
evil
and
not
only
forgive
but
also
if
possible
be
of
service
to
his
oppressor
this
conduct
is
worthy
of
man
for
what
advantage
does
he
gain
by
vengeance
the
two
actions
are
equivalent
if
one
action
is
reprehensible
both
are
reprehensible
the
only
difference
is
that
one
was
committed
first
the
other
later
but
the
community
has
the
right
of
defense
and
of
moreover
the
community
has
no
hatred
nor
animosity
for
the
murderer
it
imprisons
or
punishes
him
merely
for
the
protection
and
security
of
others
thus
when
christ
said
whosoever
shall
smite
thee
on
the
right
cheek
turn
to
him
the
left
one
also
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
teaching
men
not
to
take
personal
revenge
he
did
not
mean
that
if
a
wolf
should
fall
upon
a
flock
of
sheep
and
wish
to
destroy
it
that
the
wolf
should
be
encouraged
to
do
so
no
if
christ
had
known
that
a
wolf
had
entered
the
fold
and
was
about
to
destroy
the
sheep
most
certainly
he
would
have
prevented
it
the
constitution
of
the
communities
depends
upon
justice
then
what
christ
meant
by
forgiveness
and
pardon
is
not
that
when
nations
attack
you
burn
your
homes
plunder
your
goods
assault
your
wives
children
and
relatives
and
violate
your
honour
you
should
be
submissive
in
the
presence
of
these
tyrannical
foes
and
allow
them
to
perform
all
their
cruelties
and
oppressions
no
the
words
of
christ
refer
to
the
conduct
of
two
individuals
towards
each
other
if
one
person
assaults
another
the
injured
one
should
forgive
him
but
the
communities
must
protect
the
rights
of
man
one
thing
remains
to
be
said
it
is
that
the
communities
are
day
and
night
occupied
in
making
penal
laws
and
in
preparing
and
organizing
instruments
and
means
of
punishment
they
build
prisons
make
chains
and
fetters
arrange
places
of
exile
and
banishment
and
different
kinds
of
hardships
and
tortures
and
think
by
these
means
to
discipline
criminals
whereas
in
reality
they
are
causing
destruction
of
morals
and
perversion
of
characters
the
community
on
the
contrary
ought
day
and
night
to
strive
and
endeavour
with
the
utmost
zeal
and
effort
to
accomplish
the
education
of
men
to
cause
them
day
by
day
to
progress
and
to
increase
in
science
and
knowledge
to
acquire
virtues
to
gain
good
morals
and
to
avoid
vices

that

of
social
life
many
have
turned
for
guidance
to
the
principles
which
have
been
found
to
hold
good
in
the
lower
world
of
nature
in
this
way
they
have
come
to
regard
rivalry
and
conflict
as
necessities
of
life
and
the
ruthless
killing
out
of
the
weaker
members
of
society
as
a
legitimate
or
even
necessary
means
of
improving
the
race
bahá
u
lláh
tells
us
on
the
other
hand
that
if
we
wish
to
ascend
the
scale
of
progress
instead
of
looking
backward
to
the
animal
world
we
must
direct
our
gaze
forward
and
upward
and
must
take
not
the
beasts
but
the
prophets
as
our
guides
the
principles
of
unity
concord
and
compassion
taught
by
the
prophets
are
the
very
antithesis
of
those
dominating
the
animal
struggle
for
and
we
must
choose
between
them
for
they
can
not
be
reconciled
abdu
says
in
the
world
of
nature
the
dominant
note
is
the
struggle
for
result
of
which
is
the
survival
of
the
fittest
the
law
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
is
the
origin
of
all
difficulties
it
is
the
cause
of
war
and
strife
hatred
and
animosity
between
human
beings
in
the
world
of
nature
there
is
tyranny
egoism
aggression
overbearance
usurpation
of
the
rights
of
others
and
other
blameworthy
attributes
which
are
defects
of
the
animal
world
therefore
so
long
as
the
requirements
of
the
natural
world
play
paramount
part
among
the
children
of
men
success
and
prosperity
are
impossible
nature
is
warlike
nature
is
bloodthirsty
nature
is
tyrannical
for
nature
is
unaware
of
god
the
almighty
that
is
why
these
cruel
qualities
are
natural
to
the
animal
world
therefore
the
lord
of
mankind
having
great
love
and
mercy
has
caused
the
appearance
of
the
prophets
and
the
revelation
of
the
holy
books
so
that
through
divine
education
humanity
may
be
released
from
the
corruption
of
nature
and
the
darkness
of
ignorance
be
confirmed
with
ideal
virtues
and
spiritual
attributes
and
become
the
of
merciful
emotions
a
hundred
thousand
times
alas
that
ignorant
prejudice
unnatural
differences
and
antagonistic
principles
are
yet
displayed
by
the
nations
of
the
world
toward
one
another
thus
causing
the
retardation
of
general
progress
this
retrogression
comes
from
the
fact
that
the
principles
of
divine
civilization
are
completely
abandoned
and
the
teachings
of
the
prophets
are
forgotten
the
most
great
peace
in
all
ages
the
prophets
of
god
have
foretold
the
coming
of
an
era
of
peace
on
earth
goodwill
among
as
we
have
already
seen
bahá
u
lláh
in
the
most
glowing
and
confident
terms
confirms
these
prophecies
and
declares
that
their
fulfillment
is
at
hand
abdu
says
in
this
marvellous
cycle
the
earth
will
be
transformed
and
the
world
of
humanity
arrayed
in
tranquility
and
beauty
disputes
quarrels
and
murders
will
be
replaced
by
peace
truth
and
concord
among
the
nations
peoples
races
and
countries
love
and
amity
will
appear
and
union
will
be
established
and
finally
war
will
be
entirely
suppressed
universal
peace
will
raise
its
tent
in
the
centre
of
the
earth
and
the
blessed
tree
of
life
will
grow
and
spread
to
such
an
extent
that
it
will
overshadow
the
east
and
the
west
strong
and
weak
rich
and
poor
antagonistic
sects
and
hostile
are
like
the
wolf
and
the
lamb
the
leopard
and
kid
the
lion
and
act
towards
each
other
with
the
most
complete
love
friendship
justice
and
equity
the
world
will
be
filled
with
science
with
the
knowledge
of
the
reality
of
the
mysteries
of
beings
and
with
the
knowledge
of
answered
questions
pp
religious
prejudices
in
order
to
see
clearly
how
the
most
great
peace
may
be
established
let
us
first
examine
the
principle
causes
that
have
led
to
war
in
the
past
and
see
how
bahá
u
lláh
proposes
to
deal
with
each
one
of
the
most
fertile
causes
of
war
has
been
religious
prejudice
with
regard
to
this
the
bahá
í
teachings
show
clearly
that
animosity
and
conflict
between
people
of
different
religions
and
sects
have
always
been
due
not
to
true
religion
but
to
the
want
of
it
and
to
its
replacement
by
false
prejudices
imitations
and
misrepresentations
in
one
of
his
talks
in
paris
abdu
said
religion
should
unite
all
hearts
and
cause
wars
and
disputes
to
vanish
from
the
face
of
the
earth
it
should
give
birth
to
spirituality
and
bring
light
and
life
to
every
soul
if
religion
becomes
a
cause
of
dislike
hatred
and
division
it
would
be
better
to
be
without
it
and
to
withdraw
from
such
a
religion
would
be
a
truly
religious
act
for
it
is
clear
that
the
purpose
of
a
remedy
is
to
cure
but
if
the
remedy
only
aggravates
the
complaint
it
had
better
be
left
alone
any
religion
which
is
not
a
cause
of
love
and
unity
is
no
religion
again
he
says
from
the
beginning
of
human
history
down
to
the
present
time
various
religions
of
the
world
have
anathematized
one
another
and
accused
one
another
of
falsity
they
have
shunned
one
another
most
rigidly
exercising
mutual
animosity
and
rancor
consider
the
history
of
religious
warfare
one
of
the
greatest
religious
wars
the
crusaders
extended
over
a
period
of
years
sometimes
the
crusaders
were
successful
killing
pillaging
and
taking
captive
muḥammadan
people
sometimes
the
mussulmans
were
victorious
inflicting
bloodshed
and
ruin
in
turn
upon
the
invaders
so
they
continued
for
two
centuries
alternately
fighting
with
fury
and
relaxing
with
weakness
until
the
european
religionists
withdrew
from
the
east
leaving
ashes
of
desolation
behind
them
and
finding
their
own
nations
in
a
condition
of
turbulence
and
upheaval
yet
this
was
only
one
of
the
holy
religious
wars
have
been
many
nine
hundred
thousand
martyrs
of
the
protestant
cause
was
the
record
of
conflict
and
difference
between
that
sect
of
christians
and
the
catholics
how
many
languished
in
prisons
how
merciless
the
treatment
of
captives
all
in
the
name
of
religion
the
christians
and
muḥammadans
considered
the
jews
as
satanic
and
the
enemies
of
god
therefore
they
cursed
and
persecuted
them
great
numbers
of
jews
were
killed
their
houses
burnt
and
pillaged
their
children
carried
into
captivity
the
jews
in
turn
regarded
the
christians
as
infidels
and
the
muḥammadans
as
enemies
and
destroyers
of
the
laws
of
moses
therefore
they
called
down
vengeance
upon
them
and
curse
them
even
to
this
day
when
the
light
of
bahá
u
lláh
dawned
from
the
east
he
proclaimed
the
promise
of
the
oneness
of
humanity
he
addressed
all
mankind
saying
ye
are
all
fruits
of
one
tree
there
are
not
two
trees
one
a
tree
of
divine
mercy
the
other
a
tree
of
therefore
we
must
exercise
the
utmost
love
toward
one
another
we
must
not
consider
any
people
the
people
of
satan
but
know
and
recognize
all
as
servants
of
one
god
at
most
it
is
this
some
do
not
know
they
must
be
guided
and
trained
some
are
ignorant
they
must
be
informed
some
are
as
children
they
must
be
helped
to
reach
maturity
some
are
ailing
their
moral
condition
is
bad
they
must
be
treated
until
their
morals
are
purified
but
the
sick
man
is
not
to
be
hated
because
he
is
sick
the
child
must
not
be
shunned
because
he
is
a
child
the
ignorant
one
is
not
to
be
despised
because
he
lacks
knowledge
they
must
be
treated
educated
trained
and
assisted
in
love
everything
must
be
done
in
order
that
all
humanity
may
live
under
the
shadow
of
god
in
the
utmost
security
in
happiness
of
the
highest
type
racial
and
patriotic
prejudices
the
bahá
í
doctrine
of
the
unity
of
mankind
strikes
at
the
root
of
another
cause
of
war
namely
racial
prejudice
certain
races
have
assumed
themselves
to
be
superior
to
others
and
have
taken
for
granted
on
the
principle
of
survival
of
the
fittest
that
this
superiority
gives
them
the
right
to
exploit
for
their
own
advantage
or
even
to
exterminate
weaker
races
many
of
the
blackest
pages
in
the
world
s
history
are
examples
of
the
pitiless
application
of
this
principle
according
to
the
bahá
í
view
people
of
every
race
are
of
equal
value
in
the
sight
of
god
all
have
wonderful
innate
capacities
which
only
require
suitable
education
for
their
development
and
each
can
play
a
part
which
instead
of
impoverishing
will
enrich
and
complete
the
life
of
all
the
other
members
of
the
body
of
humanity
abdu
says
concerning
the
prejudice
of
race
it
is
an
illusion
a
superstition
pure
and
simple
for
god
created
us
all
of
one
race
in
the
beginning
also
there
were
no
limits
and
boundaries
between
the
different
lands
no
part
of
the
earth
belonged
more
to
one
people
than
to
another
in
the
sight
of
god
there
is
no
different
between
the
various
races
why
should
man
invent
such
a
prejudice
how
can
we
uphold
war
caused
by
such
an
illusion
god
has
not
created
men
that
they
should
destroy
one
another
all
races
tribes
sects
and
classes
share
equally
in
the
bounty
of
their
heavenly
father
the
only
real
difference
lies
in
the
degree
of
faithfulness
of
obedience
to
the
laws
of
god
there
are
some
who
are
as
lighted
torches
there
are
others
who
shine
as
stars
in
the
sky
of
humanity
the
lovers
of
mankind
these
are
the
superior
men
of
whatever
nation
creed
or
color
they
may
be
equally
mischievous
with
racial
prejudice
is
political
or
patriotic
prejudice
the
time
has
now
come
when
narrow
national
patriotisms
should
be
merged
in
the
wider
patriotism
whose
country
is
the
world
bahá
u
lláh
says
of
old
it
hath
been
revealed
love
of
one
s
country
is
an
element
of
the
faith
of
the
tongue
of
grandeur
hath
in
the
day
of
his
manifestation
proclaimed
it
is
not
his
to
boast
who
loveth
his
country
but
it
is
his
who
loveth
the
through
the
power
released
by
these
exalted
words
he
hath
lent
a
fresh
impulse
and
set
a
new
direction
to
the
birds
of
men
s
hearts
and
hath
obliterated
every
trace
of
restriction
and
limitation
from
god
s
holy
of
the
world
territorial
ambitions
many
are
the
wars
which
have
been
fought
over
pieces
of
territory
whose
possession
has
been
coveted
by
two
or
more
rival
nations
the
greed
of
possession
has
been
as
fertile
a
cause
of
strife
among
nations
as
among
individuals
according
to
the
bahá
í
view
land
rightly
belongs
not
to
individual
men
or
individual
nations
but
to
humanity
as
a
whole
nay
rather
it
belongs
to
god
alone
and
all
men
are
but
tenants
on
the
occasion
of
the
battle
of
benghazi
abdu
said
the
news
of
the
battle
of
benghazi
grieves
my
heart
i
wonder
at
the
human
savagery
that
still
exists
in
the
world
how
is
it
possible
for
men
to
fight
from
morning
till
night
killing
each
other
shedding
the
blood
of
their
fellowmen
and
for
what
object
to
gain
possession
of
a
part
of
the
earth
even
the
animals
when
they
fight
have
an
immediate
and
more
reasonable
cause
for
their
attacks
how
terrible
is
it
that
men
who
are
of
the
higher
kingdom
can
descend
to
slaying
and
bringing
misery
to
their
fellow
beings
for
the
possession
of
a
tract
of
highest
of
created
beings
fighting
to
obtain
the
lowest
form
of
matter
earth
land
belongs
not
to
one
people
but
to
all
people
the
earth
is
not
man
s
home
but
his
tomb
however
great
the
conqueror
however
many
countries
he
may
reduce
to
slavery
he
is
unable
to
retain
any
part
of
these
devastated
lands
but
one
tiny
tomb
if
more
land
is
required
for
the
improvement
of
the
condition
of
the
people
for
the
spread
of
civilization
surely
it
would
be
possible
to
acquire
peaceably
the
necessary
extension
of
territory
but
war
is
made
for
the
satisfaction
of
men
s
ambition
for
the
sake
of
worldly
gain
to
the
few
terrible
misery
is
brought
to
numberless
homes
breaking
the
hearts
of
hundred
of
men
and
women
i
charge
you
all
that
each
one
of
you
concentrate
all
the
thoughts
of
his
heart
on
love
and
unity
when
a
thought
of
war
comes
oppose
it
by
a
stronger
thought
of
peace
a
thought
of
hatred
must
be
destroyed
by
a
more
powerful
thought
of
love
when
soldiers
of
the
world
draw
their
swords
to
kill
soldiers
of
god
clasp
each
other
s
hands
so
may
all
the
savagery
of
men
disappear
by
the
mercy
of
god
working
through
the
pure
in
heart
and
the
sincere
of
soul
do
not
think
the
peace
of
the
world
an
ideal
impossible
to
attain
nothing
is
impossible
to
the
divine
benevolence
of
god
if
you
desire
with
all
your
heart
friendship
with
every
race
on
earth
your
thought
spiritual
and
positive
will
spread
it
will
become
the
desire
of
others
growing
stronger
until
it
reaches
the
minds
of
all
men
universal
language
having
glanced
at
the
principal
causes
of
war
and
how
they
may
be
avoided
we
may
now
proceed
to
examine
certain
constructive
proposals
made
by
bahá
u
lláh
with
a
view
to
achieving
the
most
great
peace
the
first
deals
with
the
establishment
of
a
universal
auxiliary
language
bahá
u
lláh
refers
to
this
matter
in
the
book
of
aqdas
and
in
many
of
his
tablets
thus
in
the
tablet
of
he
says
the
sixth
effulgence
is
concord
and
union
amongst
men
through
the
radiance
of
union
have
the
regions
of
the
world
at
all
times
been
illumined
and
the
greatest
of
all
means
thereunto
is
the
understanding
of
one
another
s
writing
and
speech
ere
this
in
our
epistles
have
we
commanded
the
trustees
of
the
house
of
justice
either
to
choose
one
of
the
existing
tongues
or
to
originate
a
new
one
and
in
like
manner
to
adopt
a
common
script
teaching
these
to
the
children
in
all
the
schools
of
the
world
that
the
world
may
become
even
as
one
land
and
one
home
about
the
time
when
this
proposal
of
bahá
u
lláh
was
first
given
to
the
world
there
was
born
in
poland
a
boy
named
ludovic
zamenhof
who
was
destined
to
play
a
leading
part
in
carrying
it
into
effect
almost
from
his
infancy
the
ideal
of
a
universal
language
became
a
dominant
motive
in
zamenhof
s
life
and
the
result
of
his
devoted
labors
was
the
invention
and
widespread
adoption
of
the
language
known
as
esperanto
which
has
now
stood
the
test
of
many
years
and
has
proved
to
be
a
very
satisfactory
medium
of
international
intercourse
it
has
the
great
advantage
that
it
can
be
mastered
in
about
a
twentieth
part
of
the
time
required
to
master
such
languages
as
english
french
or
german
at
an
esperanto
banquet
given
in
paris
in
february
abdu
said
today
one
of
the
chief
causes
of
the
differences
in
europe
is
the
diversity
of
languages
we
say
this
man
is
a
german
the
other
is
an
italian
then
we
meet
an
englishman
and
then
again
a
frenchman
although
they
belong
to
the
same
race
yet
language
is
the
greatest
barrier
between
them
were
a
universal
auxiliary
language
in
operation
they
would
all
be
considered
as
one
his
holiness
bahá
u
lláh
wrote
about
this
international
language
more
than
forty
years
ago
he
says
that
as
long
as
an
international
language
is
not
adopted
complete
union
between
the
various
sections
of
the
world
will
be
unrealized
for
we
observe
that
misunderstandings
keep
people
from
mutual
association
and
these
misunderstandings
will
not
be
dispelled
except
through
an
international
auxiliary
language
generally
speaking
the
whole
people
of
the
orient
are
not
fully
informed
of
events
in
the
west
neither
can
the
westerners
put
themselves
in
sympathetic
touch
with
the
easterners
their
thoughts
are
enclosed
in
a
international
language
will
be
the
master
key
to
open
it
were
we
in
possession
of
a
universal
language
the
western
books
could
easily
be
translated
into
that
language
and
the
eastern
peoples
be
informed
of
their
contents
in
the
same
way
the
books
of
the
east
could
be
translated
into
that
language
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
in
the
west
the
greatest
means
of
progress
towards
the
union
of
east
and
west
will
be
a
common
language
it
will
make
the
whole
world
one
home
and
become
the
strongest
impulse
for
human
advancement
it
will
upraise
the
standard
of
the
oneness
of
humanity
it
will
make
the
earth
one
universal
commonwealth
it
will
be
the
cause
of
love
between
the
children
of
men
it
will
cause
good
fellowship
between
the
various
races
now
praise
be
to
god
that
zamenhof
has
invented
the
esperanto
language
it
has
all
the
potential
qualities
of
becoming
the
international
means
of
communication
all
of
us
must
be
grateful
and
thankful
to
him
for
this
noble
effort
for
in
this
way
he
has
served
his
fellowmen
well
with
untiring
effort
and
on
the
part
of
its
devotees
esperanto
will
become
universal
therefore
every
one
of
us
must
study
this
language
and
spread
it
as
far
as
possible
so
that
day
by
day
it
may
receive
a
broader
recognition
be
accepted
by
all
nations
and
governments
of
the
world
and
become
a
part
of
the
curriculum
in
all
the
public
schools
i
hope
that
esperanto
will
be
adopted
as
the
language
of
all
the
future
international
conferences
and
congresses
so
that
all
people
need
acquire
only
two
their
own
tongue
and
the
other
the
international
language
then
perfect
union
will
be
established
between
all
the
people
of
the
world
consider
how
difficult
it
is
today
to
communicate
with
various
nations
if
one
studies
fifty
languages
one
may
yet
travel
through
a
country
and
not
know
the
language
therefore
i
hope
that
you
will
make
the
utmost
effort
so
that
this
language
of
esperanto
may
be
widely
spread
while
these
allusions
to
esperanto
are
specific
and
encouraging
it
remains
true
that
until
the
house
of
justice
has
acted
on
the
matter
in
accordance
with
bahá
u
lláh
s
instruction
the
bahá
í
faith
is
not
committed
to
esperanto
nor
to
any
other
living
or
artificial
tongue
abdu
himself
said
the
love
and
effort
put
into
esperanto
will
not
be
lost
but
no
one
person
can
construct
a
universal
abdu
in
london
which
language
to
adopt
and
whether
it
is
to
be
a
natural
or
constructed
one
is
a
decision
which
the
nations
of
the
world
will
have
to
make
universal
league
of
nations
another
proposal
frequently
and
powerfully
advocated
by
bahá
u
lláh
was
that
a
universal
league
of
nations
should
be
formed
for
the
maintenance
of
international
peace
in
a
letter
to
queen
victoria
written
while
he
was
still
a
prisoner
in
the
barracks
of
akká
he
said
o
rulers
of
the
earth
be
reconciled
among
yourselves
that
ye
may
need
no
more
armaments
save
in
a
measure
to
safeguard
your
territories
and
dominions
be
united
o
kings
of
the
earth
for
thereby
will
the
tempest
of
discord
be
stilled
amongst
you
and
your
people
find
rest
should
any
one
among
you
take
up
arms
against
another
rise
ye
all
against
him
for
this
is
naught
but
manifest
justice
in
abdu
gave
a
forecast
of
the
establishment
of
a
universal
league
of
nations
which
is
especially
interesting
at
the
present
time
in
view
of
the
strenuous
attempts
now
being
made
to
establish
such
a
league
he
wrote
true
civilization
will
unfurl
its
banner
in
the
midmost
heart
of
the
world
whenever
a
certain
number
of
its
distinguished
and
shining
exemplars
of
devotion
and
for
the
good
and
happiness
of
all
mankind
arise
with
firm
resolve
and
clear
vision
to
establish
the
cause
of
universal
peace
they
must
make
the
cause
of
peace
the
object
of
general
consultation
and
seek
by
every
means
in
their
power
to
establish
a
union
of
the
nations
of
the
world
they
must
conclude
a
binding
treaty
and
establish
a
covenant
the
provisions
of
which
shall
be
sound
inviolable
and
definite
they
must
proclaim
it
to
all
the
world
and
obtain
for
it
the
sanction
of
all
the
human
race
this
supreme
and
noble
real
source
of
the
peace
and
of
all
the
be
regarded
as
sacred
by
all
that
dwell
on
earth
all
the
forces
of
humanity
must
be
mobilized
to
ensure
the
stability
and
permanence
of
this
most
great
covenant
in
this
pact
the
limits
and
frontiers
of
each
and
every
nation
should
be
clearly
fixed
the
principles
underlying
the
relations
of
governments
towards
one
another
definitely
laid
down
and
all
international
agreements
and
obligations
ascertained
in
like
manner
the
size
of
the
armaments
of
every
government
should
be
strictly
limited
for
if
the
preparations
for
war
and
the
military
forces
of
any
nation
should
be
allowed
to
increase
they
will
arouse
the
suspicion
of
others
the
fundamental
principle
underlying
this
solemn
pact
should
be
so
fixed
that
if
any
government
later
violate
any
one
of
its
provisions
all
the
governments
on
earth
should
arise
to
reduce
it
to
utter
submission
nay
the
human
race
as
a
whole
should
resolve
with
every
power
at
its
disposal
to
destroy
that
government
should
this
greatest
of
all
remedies
be
applied
to
the
sick
body
of
the
world
it
will
assuredly
recover
from
its
ills
and
will
remain
eternally
safe
and
secret
of
divine
civilization
pp
bahá
ís
see
grave
deficiencies
in
the
structure
of
the
league
of
nations
which
falls
short
of
the
type
of
institution
which
bahá
u
lláh
described
as
essential
to
the
establishment
of
world
peace
on
december
abdu
declared
at
present
universal
peace
is
a
matter
of
great
importance
but
unity
of
conscience
is
essential
so
that
the
foundation
of
this
matter
may
become
secure
its
establishment
firm
and
its
edifice
strong
although
the
league
of
nations
has
been
brought
into
existence
yet
it
is
incapable
of
establishing
universal
peace
but
the
supreme
tribunal
which
his
holiness
bahá
u
lláh
has
described
will
fulfill
this
sacred
task
with
the
utmost
might
and
power
international
arbitration
bahá
u
lláh
also
advocated
the
establishment
of
an
international
court
of
arbitration
so
that
differences
arising
between
nations
might
be
settled
in
accordance
with
justice
and
reason
instead
of
by
appeal
to
the
ordeal
of
battle
in
a
letter
to
the
secretary
of
the
mohonk
conference
on
international
arbitration
in
august
abdu
said
about
fifty
years
ago
in
the
book
of
aqdas
bahá
u
lláh
commanded
people
to
establish
universal
peace
and
summoned
all
the
nations
to
the
divine
banquet
of
international
arbitration
so
that
the
questions
of
boundaries
of
national
honor
and
property
and
of
vital
interests
between
nations
might
be
settled
by
an
arbitral
court
of
justice
and
that
no
nation
would
dare
to
refuse
to
abide
by
the
decisions
thus
arrived
at
if
any
quarrel
between
two
nations
it
must
be
adjudicated
by
this
international
court
and
be
arbitrated
and
decided
upon
like
the
judgment
rendered
by
the
judge
between
two
individuals
if
at
any
time
any
nation
dares
to
break
such
a
decision
all
the
other
nations
must
arise
to
put
down
this
rebellion
again
in
one
of
his
paris
talks
in
he
said
a
supreme
tribunal
shall
be
established
by
the
peoples
and
governments
of
every
nation
composed
of
members
elected
from
each
country
and
government
the
members
of
this
great
council
shall
assemble
in
unity
all
disputes
of
an
international
character
shall
be
submitted
to
this
court
its
work
being
to
arrange
by
arbitration
everything
which
otherwise
would
be
a
cause
of
war
this
mission
of
this
tribunal
would
be
to
prevent
war
during
the
quarter
of
a
century
preceding
the
establishment
of
the
league
of
nations
a
permanent
court
of
arbitration
was
established
at
the
hague
and
many
arbitration
treaties
were
signed
but
most
of
these
fell
far
short
of
the
comprehensive
proposals
of
bahá
u
lláh
no
arbitration
treaty
was
made
between
two
great
powers
in
which
all
matters
of
dispute
were
included
differences
affecting
vital
interests
honor
and
independence
were
specifically
excepted
not
only
so
but
effective
guarantees
that
nations
would
abide
by
the
terms
of
the
treaties
into
which
they
had
entered
were
lacking
in
the
bahá
í
proposals
on
the
other
hand
questions
of
boundaries
of
national
honor
and
of
vital
interest
are
expressly
included
and
agreements
will
have
the
supreme
guarantee
of
the
world
league
of
nations
behind
them
only
when
these
proposals
are
completely
carried
out
will
international
arbitration
attain
the
full
scope
of
its
beneficent
possibilities
and
the
curse
of
war
be
finally
banished
from
the
world
limitation
of
armaments
abdu
says
by
a
general
agreement
all
the
governments
of
the
world
must
disarm
simultaneously
it
will
not
do
if
one
lays
down
its
arms
and
the
others
refuse
to
do
so
the
nations
of
the
world
must
concur
with
each
other
concerning
this
supremely
important
subject
so
that
they
may
abandon
together
the
deadly
weapons
of
human
slaughter
as
long
as
one
nation
increases
her
military
and
naval
budget
other
nations
will
be
forced
into

at

in

even
for
strictly
defensive
purposes
in

many
many
thousands
of

have
suffered
cruel
deaths
because
of
their
faith
in
the
early
days
of
the
cause
the
bábís
on

occasions
defended
themselves
and
their

by

with
great
courage
and
bravery
bahá

however
forbade
this
abdu
writes
when
bahá

appeared
he
declared
that
the
promulgation
of
the
truth
by
such
means
must
on
no
account
be
allowed
even
for
purposes
of

abrogated
the

of

and
annulled
the
ordinance
of

if
ye
be
slain
said
he
it
is
better
for
you
than
to
slay
it
is
through
the
firmness
and
assurance
of
the
faithful
that
the
cause
of
the
lord
must
be
diffused
as
the
faithful
fearless
and
undaunted
arise
with
absolute
detachment
to
exalt
the
word
of
god
and
with
eyes
averted
from
the
things
of
this
world
engaged
in
service
for
the
lord
s
sake
and
by
his
power
thereby
will
they
cause
the
word
of
truth
to
triumph
these
blessed
souls
bear
witness
by
their
lifeblood
to
the
truth
of
the
cause
and
attest
it
by
the
sincerity
of
their
faith
their
devotion
and
their
constancy

can
avail
to
diffuse
his
cause
and
to
defeat

with
fairness
by

such
hath
been
the
patience
the
calm
the
resignation
of
contentment
of
this
people
that
they
have
become
the
exponents
of
justice
and
so
great
hath
been
their
forbearance
that
they
have
suffered
themselves
to
be
killed
rather
than

this
notwithstanding
that

hath
wronged
have
endured
tribulations
the
like
of
which
the

hath
never

have
induced

to
reconcile

to

grievous
trials

to
refuse
to
put
forth

to
repel

what
could
have
caused
such
resignation

the
true
cause
is
to
be
found
in
the

way
in
which
these

cast
the
crowns
of
their

at
the
feet
of

has
furnished
to
the

the
clearest
proof
that
they
had
found
a
new

for
which
death
has
no
terrors
a
life
of
ineffable
fullness

with
which
the
pleasures
of

are
but
as
dust
in
the
balance
and
the
most
fiendish
physical
tortures
but
trifles
light
as
air
righteous
warfare
although
bahá
u
lláh
like
christ
counsels
his
follows
as
individuals
and
as
a
religious
body
to
adopt
an
attitude
of
nonresistance
and
forgiveness
toward
their
enemies
he
teaches
that
it
is
the
duty
of
the
community
to
prevent
injustice
and
oppression
if
individuals
are
persecuted
and
injured
it
is
wrong
for
a
community
to
allow
pillage
and
murder
to
continue
unchecked
within
its
borders
it
is
the
duty
of
a
good
government
to
prevent
wrongdoing
and
to
punish
offenders
so
also
with
the
community
of
nations
if
one
nation
oppresses
or
injures
another
it
is
the
duty
of
all
other
nations
to
unite
to
prevent
such
oppression
abdu
writes
it
may
happen
that
at
a
given
time
warlike
and
savage
tribes
may
furiously
attack
the
body
politic
with
the
intention
of
carrying
on
a
wholesale
slaughter
of
its
members
under
such
a
circumstance
defense
is
hitherto
the
usual
practice
of
mankind
has
been
that
if
one
nation
attacked
another
the
rest
of
the
nations
of
the
world
remained
neutral
and
accepted
no
responsibility
in
the
matter
unless
their
own
interests
were
directly
affected
or
threatened
the
whole
burden
of
defense
was
left
to
the
nation
attacked
however
weak
and
helpless
it
might
be
the
teaching
of
bahá
u
lláh
reverses
this
position
and
throws
the
responsibility
of
defense
not
specially
on
the
nation
attacked
but
on
all
the
others
individually
and
collectively
as
the
whole
of
mankind
is
one
community
an
attack
on
any
one
nation
is
an
attack
on
the
community
and
ought
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
community
were
this
doctrine
generally
recognized
and
acted
on
any
nation
contemplating
an
aggression
on
another
would
know
in
advance
that
it
would
have
to
reckon
with
the
opposition
not
of
that
other
nation
only
but
of
the
whole
of
the
rest
of
the
world
this
knowledge
alone
would
be
sufficient
to
deter
even
the
boldest
and
most
bellicose
of
nations
when
a
sufficiently
strong
league
of
nations
is
established
war
will
there
become
a
thing
of
the
past
during
the
period
of
transition
from
the
old
state
of
international
anarchy
to
the
new
state
of
international
solidarity
aggressive
wars
will
still
be
possible
and
in
these
circumstances
military
or
other
coercive
action
in
the
cause
of
international
justice
unity
and
peace
may
be
a
positive
duty
abdu
writes
that
in
such
case
a
conquest
can
be
a
praiseworthy
thing
and
there
are
times
when
war
becomes
the
powerful
basis
of
peace
and
ruin
the
very
means
of
reconstruction
if
for
example
a
sovereign
marshals
his
troops
to
block
the
onset
of
the
insurgent
and
the
aggressor
or
again
if
he
takes
the
field
and
distinguishes
himself
in
a
struggle
to
unify
a
divided
state
and
people
if
in
brief
he
is
waging
war
for
a
righteous
purpose
then
this
seeming
wrath
is
mercy
itself
and
this
apparent
tyranny
the
very
substance
of
justice
and
this
warfare
the
cornerstone
of
peace
today
the
task
befitting
great
rulers
is
to
establish
universal
peace
for
in
this
lies
the
freedom
of
all
secret
of
divine
civilization
pp
unity
of
east
and
west
another
factor
which
will
help
in
bringing
about
universal
peace
is
the
linking
together
of
the
east
and
the
west
the
most
great
peace
is
no
mere
cessation
of
hostilities
but
a
fertilizing
union
and
cordial
cooperation
of
the
hitherto
sundered
peoples
of
the
earth
which
will
bear
much
precious
fruit
in
one
of
his
talks
in
paris
abdu
said
in
the
past
as
in
the
present
the
spiritual
sun
of

although
the

dawned
in

the
radiance
thereof
was
apparent
in
the

where
the
effulgence
of
its
glory
was
more
clearly
seen
the
divine
light
of
his
teaching
shone
with
a
greater
force
in
the

where
it
has
made
more
rapid

than
in

of

in
these

the
east
is
in
need
of
material
progress
and
the
west
is
in
need
of
a
spiritual
ideal
it
would
be
well
for
the
west
to
turn
to
the
east
for
illumination
and
to
give
in
exchange
its
scientific
knowledge
there
must
be
this
interchange
of
gifts
the
east
and
the
west
must
unite
to
give
to
each
other
what
is
lacking
this
union
will
bring
about
true
civilization
where
the

is
expressed
and
carried
out
in

thus
the
one
from

the
greatest
harmony
will
prevail
all

will
be

a
state
of
great

will

attained
there
will
be

this

will
become
a
shining
mirror
for
the
reflection
of
the

we
all
the

with

to

this

the

between

every

they
who
perceive
it
does
it
not
seem
strange
that
christian
sects
should
have
instituted
the
monastic
life
and
celibacy
for
the
clergy
in
view
of
the
facts
that
christ
chose
married
men
for
his
disciples
and
both
he
himself
and
his
apostles
lived
lives
of
active
beneficence
in
close
association
and
familiar
intercourse
with
the
people
in
the
muḥammadan
qur
án
we
read
to
jesus
the
son
of
mary
we
gave
the
gospel
and
we
put
into
the
hearts
of
those
who
followed
him
kindness
and
compassion
but
as
to
the
monastic
life
they
invented
it
themselves
the
desire
only
of
pleasing
god
did
we
prescribe
to
them
and
this
they
observed
not
as
it
ought
to
have
been
án
lviii
whatever
justification
there
may
have
been
for
the
monastic
life
in
ancient
times
and
bygone
circumstances
bahá
u
lláh
declares
that
such
justification
no
longer
exists
and
indeed
it
seems
obvious
that
the
withdrawal
of
a
large
number
of
the
most
pious
and
of
the
population
from
association
with
their
fellows
and
from
the
duties
and
responsibilities
of
parenthood
must
result
in
the
spiritual
impoverishment
of
the
race
marriage
the
bahá
í
teachings
enjoin
monogamy
and
bahá
u
lláh
makes
marriage
conditional
on
the
consent
of
both
parties
and
of
their
parents
he
says
in
the
book
of
aqdas
verily
in
the
book
of
bayán
the
báb
s
revelation
the
matter
is
restricted
to
the
consent
of
both
bride
and
bridegroom
as
we
desired
to
bring
about
love
and
friendship
and
the
unity
of
the
people
therefore
we
made
it
conditional
upon
the
consent
of
the
parents
also
that
enmity
and
might
be
on
this
point
abdu
wrote
to
an
inquirer
as
to
the
question
of
marriage
according
to
the
law
of
god
first
you
must
select
one
and
then
it
depends
on
the
consent
of
the
father
and
mother
before
your
selection
they
have
no
right
of
abdu
says
that
as
a
result
of
this
precaution
of
bahá
u
lláh
s
the
strained
relations
between
which
have
become
proverbial
in
christian
and
muḥammadan
countries
are
almost
unknown
among
the
bahá
ís
and
divorce
is
also
of
very
rare
occurrence
he
writes
on
the
subject
of
matrimony
bahá
í
marriage
is
union
and
cordial
affection
between
the
two
parties
they
must
however
exercise
the
utmost
care
and
become
acquainted
with
each
other
s
character
this
eternal
bond
should
be
made
secure
by
a
firm
covenant
and
the
intention
should
be
to
foster
harmony
fellowship
and
unity
and
to
attain
everlasting
life
in
a
true
bahá
í
marriage
the
two
parties
must
become
fully
united
both
spiritually
and
physically
so
that
they
may
attain
eternal
union
throughout
all
the
worlds
of
god
and
improve
the
spiritual
life
of
each
other
this
is
bahá
í
matrimony
the
bahá
í
marriage
ceremony
is
very
simple
the
only
requirement
being
that
the
groom
and
the
bride
in
the
presence
of
at
least
two
witnesses
each
say
we
will
all
verily
abide
by
the
will
of
divorce
in
the
matter
of
divorce
as
in
that
of
marriage
the
instructions
of
the
prophets
have
varied
in
accordance
with
the
circumstances
of
the
times
abdu
states
the
bahá
í
teaching
with
regard
to
divorce
thus
the
friends
bahá
ís
must
strictly
refrain
from
divorce
unless
something
arises
which
compels
them
to
separate
because
of
their
aversion
for
each
other
in
that
case
with
the
knowledge
of
the
spiritual
assembly
they
may
decide
to
separate
they
must
then
be
patient
and
wait
one
complete
year
if
during
this
year
harmony
is
not
reestablished
between
them
then
their
divorce
may
be
realized
the
foundation
of
the
kingdom
of
god
is
based
upon
harmony
and
love
oneness
relationship
and
union
not
upon
differences
especially
between
husband
and
wife
if
one
of
these
two
become
the
cause
of
divorce
that
one
will
unquestionably
fall
into
great
difficulties
will
become
the
victim
of
formidable
calamities

matter

as
in
other
matters
bahá

will
of
course
be
bound
not

by
the
bahá

but
also
by
the
laws
of
the
country
in
which
they
live
the
bahá

calendar
among
different
peoples
and
at
different
times
many
different
methods
have
been
adopted
for
the
measurement
of
time
and
fixing
of
dates
and
several
different
calendars
are
still
in
daily
use
the
gregorian
in
western
europe
the
julian
in
many
countries
of
eastern
europe
the
hebrew
among
the
jews
and
the
muḥammadan
in
muslim
communities
the
báb
signalized
the
importance
of
the
dispensation
which
he
came
to
herald
by
inaugurating
a
new
calendar
in
this
as
in
the
gregorian
calendar
the
lunar
month
is
abandoned
and
the
solar
year
is
adopted
the
bahá
í
year
consists
of
months
of
days
each
days
with
the
addition
of
certain
intercalary
days
four
in
ordinary
and
five
in
leap
years
between
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
months
in
order
to
adjust
the
calendar
to
the
solar
year
the
báb
named
the
months
after
the
attributes
of

the
bahá

like
the
ancient
persian
new

is
astronomically
fixed
commencing
at
the

commences

in
the
not
far
distant
future
it
will
be
necessary
that
all
peoples
in
the
world
agree
on
a
common
calendar
it
seems
therefore
fitting
that
the
new
age
of
unity
should
have
a
new
calendar
free
from
the
objections
and
associations
which
make
each
of
the
older
calendar
unacceptable
to
large
sections
of
the
world
s
population
and
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
any
other
arrangement
could
exceed
in

spiritual

before

completed

mission
he
had
laid
a
basis
for
the
development
of
the
administrative
order
established
in
bahá
u
lláh
s
writings
to
show
the
high
importance
to
be
attributed
to
the
institution
of
the
spiritual
assembly
abdu
in
a
tablet
declared
that
a
certain
translation
must
be
approved
by
the
spiritual
assembly
of
cairo
before
publication
even
though
he
himself
had
reviewed
and
corrected
the
text
by
spiritual
assembly
is
meant
the
administrative
body
of
nine
persons
elected
annually
by
each
local
bahá
í
community
in
which
is
vested
the
authority
of
decision
on
all
matters
of
mutual
action
on
the
part
of
the
community
this
designation
is
temporary
since
in
future
the
spiritual
assemblies
will
be
termed
houses
of
justice
unlike
the
organization
of
churches
these
bahá
í
bodies
are
social
rather
than
ecclesiastical
institutions
that
is
they
apply
the
law
of
consultation
to
all
questions
and
difficulties
arising
between
bahá
ís
who
are
called
upon
no
to
carry
them
to
the
civil
court
and
seek
to
promote
unity
as
well
as
justice
throughout
the
community
the
spiritual
assembly
is
in
no
wise
equivalent
to
the
priest
or
clergy
but
is
responsible
for
upholding
the
teachings
stimulating
active
service
conducting
meetings
maintaining
unity
holding
bahá

property
in
trust
for
the
community
and
representing
it
in
its
relations
to
the
public
and
to
other
bahá

communities
the
nature
of
the
spiritual

local
and
national
is
described
more
fully
in
the
section
devoted
to
the
will
and
testament
of
abdu
in

its
general
functions

a

no

devolve

in

it

discreet

protect
at

the

efface

from
every

secure

an

on

it

by
making
it
a

devoted

during

today
there
is
no

undoubtedly
the

upon

must
leave
tangible
philanthropic

ideal
traces
that
should
reach
all
mankind
and
not

philanthropic
affairs
are
for
all

without

because
it

the
manifestation

therefore
my
hope
is
that
the

every

may
become
as

fast
the
nineteenth
month
following
immediately
on
the
hospitality
of
the
intercalary
days
is
the
month
of
the
fast
during
nineteen
days
the
fast
is
observed
by
abstaining
from
both
food
and
drink
from
sunrise
to
sunset
as
the
month
of
the
fast
ends
at
the
march
equinox
the
fast
always
falls
in
the
same
season
namely
spring
in
the
northern
and
autumn
in
the
southern
hemisphere
never
in
the
extreme
heart
of
summer
nor
in
the
extreme
cold
of
winter
when
hardship
would
be
likely
to
result
at
that
season
moreover
the
interval
between
sunrise
and
sunset
is
approximately
the
same
all
over
the
habitable
portion
of
the
globe
namely
from
about
to
the
fast
is
not
binding
on
children
and
invalids
on
travelers
or
on
those
who
are
too
old
or
too
weak
including
women
who
are
with
child
or
have
babes
at
the
breast
there
is
much
evidence
to
show
that
a
periodical
fast
such
as
is
enjoined
by
the
bahá
í
teachings
is
beneficial
as
a
measure
of
physical
hygiene
but
just
as
the
reality
of
the
bahá
í
fast
does
not
lie
in
the
consumption
of
physical
food
but
in
the
commemoration
of
god
which
is
our
spiritual
food
so
the
reality
of
the
bahá
í
fast
does
not
consist
in
abstention
from
physical
food
although
that
may
help
in
the
purification
of
the
body
but
in
the
abstention
from
the
desires
and
lusts
of
the
flesh
and
in
severance
from
all
save
god
abdu
says
fasting
is
a
symbol
fasting
signifies
abstinence
from
lust
physical
fasting
is
a
symbol
of
that
abstinence
and
is
a
reminder
that
is
just
as
a
person
abstains
from
physical
appetites
he
is
to
abstain
from
and
but
mere
abstention
from
food
has
no
effect
on
the
spirit
it
is
only
a
symbol
a
reminder
otherwise
it
is
of
no
importance
fasting
for
this
purpose
does
not
mean
entire
abstinence
from
food
the
golden
rule
as
to
food
is
do
not
take
too
much
or
too
little
moderation
is
necessary
there
is
a
sect
in
india
who
practice
extreme
abstinence
and
gradually
reduce
their
food
until
they
exist
on
almost
nothing
but
their
intelligence
suffers
a
man
is
not
fit
to
do
service
for
god
with
brain
or
body
if
he
is
weakened
by
lack
of
food
he
can
not
see
clearly
quoted
by

in

review
june
meetings
abdu
attaches
the
greatest
important
to
regular
meetings
of
the
believers
for
united
worship
for
the
exposition
and
study
of
the
teachings
and
for
consultation
regarding
the
progress
of
the
movement
in
one
of
his
tablets
he
says
it
hath
been
decided
by
the
desire
of
god
that
union
and
harmony
may
day
by
day
increase
among
the
friends
of
god
and
the
handmaids
of
the
merciful
not
until
this
is
realized
will
the
affairs
advance
by
any
means
whatever
and
the
greatest
means
for
the
union
and
harmony
of
all
are
spiritual
meetings
this
matter
is
very
important
and
is
as
a
magnet
to
attract
divine
confirmation
in
the
spiritual
meetings
of
bahá
ís
contentious
argument
and
the
discussion
of
political
or
worldly
affairs
must
be
avoided
the
sole
aim
of
the
believers
should
be
to
teach
and
learn
divine
truth
to
have
their
hearts
filled
with
divine
love
to
attain
more
perfect
obedience
to
the
divine
will
and
to
promote
the
coming
of
the
kingdom
of
god
in
an
address
given
at
new
york
in
abdu
said
the
bahá
í
meeting
must
be
the
meeting
of
the
celestial
concourse
it
must
be
illumined
by
the
lights
of
the
celestial
concourse
the
hearts
must
be
as
mirrors
wherein
the
lights
of
the
sun
of
truth
shall
be
revealed
every
bosom
must
be
as
a
telegraph
station
one
terminal
of
the
wire
shall
be
in
the
bosom
of
the
soul
the
other
in
the
celestial
concourse
so
that
messages
may
be
exchanged
between
them
in
this
way
from

inspiration
shall
flow
and
in
all
discussions
harmony
shall
prevail
the

unity
and

prevail
among

the

assist
you
and

of
the
blessed
beauty

support
you
in
one
of
his
tablets
he
said
in
these
meetings
outside
conversation
must
be
entirely
avoided
and
the
gathering
must
be
confined
to
chanting
the
verses
and
reading
the
words
and
to
matters
which
concern
the
cause
of
god
such
as
explaining
proofs
adducing
clear
and
manifest
evidences
and
tracing
the
signs
of
the
beloved
one
of
the
creatures
those
who
attend
the
meeting
must
before
entering
be
arrayed
with
the
utmost
cleanliness
and
turn
to
the
abhá
kingdom
and
then
enter
the
meeting
with
all
meekness
and
humbleness
and
while
the
tablets
are
being
read
must
be
quiet
and
silent
and
if
one
wishes
to
speak
he
must
do
so
with
all
courtesy
with
the
satisfaction
and
permission
of
those
present
and
do
it
with
eloquence
and
fluency
the
nineteen
day
feast
with
the
development
of
the
bahá
í
administrative
order
since
the
ascension
of
abdu
the
nineteen
day
feast
observed
on
the
first
day
of
each
bahá
í
month
has
assumed
a
very
special
importance
providing
as
it
does
not
only
for
community
prayer
and
reading
from
the
holy
books
but
also
for
general
consultation
on
all
current
bahá
í
affairs
and
for
the
association
of
the
friends
together
this
feast
is
the
occasion
when
the
spiritual
assembly
makes
its
reports
to
the
community
and
invites
both
discussion
of
plans
and
suggestions
for
new
and
better
methods
of

mashriqu
bahá
u
lláh
left
instructions
that
temples
of
worship
should
be
built
by
his
followers
in
every
country
and
city
to
these
temples
he
gave
the
name
of
which
means
dawning
place
of
god
s
the
is
to
be
a
building
surmounted
by
a
dome
and
as
beautiful
as
possible
in
design
and
workmanship
it
is
to
stand
in
a
large
garden
adorned
with
fountains
trees
and
flowers
surrounded
by
a
number
of
accessory
buildings
devoted
to
educational
charitable
and
social
purposes
so
that
the
worship
of
god
in
the
temple
may
always
be
closely
associated
with
reverent
delight
in
the
beauties
of
nature
and
of
art
and
with
practical
work
for
the
amelioration
of
social
conditions
in
persia
up
till
the
present
bahá
ís
have
been
debarred
from
building
temples
for
public
worship
and
so
the
first
great
was
built
in
russia
abdu
dedicated
the
site
of
the
second
bahá
í
house
of
worship
to
stand
on
the
shore
of
lake
michigan
a
few
miles
north
of
chicago
during
his
visit
to
america
in
in
tablets
referring
to
this
mother
temple
of
the
west
abdu
writes
as
follows
praise
be
to
god
that
at
this
moment
from
every
country
in
the
world
according
to
their
various
means
contributions
are
continually
being
sent
toward
the
fund
of
the
in
america
from
the
day
of
adam
until
now
such
a
thing
has
never
been
witnessed
by
man
that
from
the
furthermost
country
of
asia
contributions
were
forwarded
to
america
this
is
through
the
power
of
the
covenant
of
god
verily
this
is
a
cause
of
astonishment
for
the
people
of
perception
it
is
hoped
that
the
believers
of
god
may
show
magnanimity
and
raise
a
great
sum
for
the
building
i
want
everyone
left
free
to
act
as
he
wills
if
anyone
wishes
to
put
money
into
other
things
let
him
do
so
do
not
interfere
with
him
in
any
way
but
be
assured
that
the
most
important
thing
at
this
time
is
the
building
of
the
the
mystery
of
the
edifice
is
great
and
can
not
be
unveiled
yet
but
its
erection
is
the
most
important
undertaking
of
this
day
the
has
important
accessories
which
are
accounted
of
the
basic
foundations
these
are
school
for
orphan
children
hospital
and
dispensary
for
the
poor
home
for
the
incapable
college
for
the
higher
scientific
education
and
hospice
in
every
city
a
great
must
be
founded
after
this
order
in
the
services
will
be
held
every
morning
there
will
be
no
organ
in
the
temple
in
buildings
nearby
festivals
services
conventions
public
meetings
and
spiritual
gatherings
will
be
held
but
in
the
temple
the
chanting
and
singing
will
be
unaccompanied
open
ye
the
gates
of
the
temple
to
all
mankind
when
these
institutions
college
hospital
hospice
and
establishment
for
the
incurables
university
for
the
study
of
higher
sciences
giving
courses
and
other
philanthropic
buildings
are
built
the
doors
will
be
opened
to
all
the
nations
and
religions
there
will
be
absolutely
no
line
of
demarcation
drawn
its
charities
will
be
dispense
irrespective
of
color
or
race
its
gates
will
be
flung
wide
open
to
mankind
prejudice
towards
none
love
for
all
the
central
building
will
be
devoted
to
the
purpose
of
prayer
and
worship
thus
religion
will
become
harmonized
with
science
and
science
will
be
the
handmaid
of
religion
both
showering
their
material
and
spiritual
gifts
on
all
humanity
life
after
death
bahá
u
lláh
tells
us
that
the
life
in
the
flesh
is
but
the
embryonic
stage
of
our
existence
and
that
escape
from
the
body
is
like
a
new
birth
through
which
the
human
spirit
enters
on
a
fuller
freer
life
he
writes
know
thou
of
a
truth
that
the
soul
after
its
separation
from
the
body
will
continue
to
progress
until
it
attaineth
the
presence
of
god
in
a
state
and
condition
which
neither
the
revolution
of
ages
and
centuries
nor
the
changes
and
chances
of
this
world
can
alter
it
will
endure
as
long
as
the
kingdom
of
god
his
sovereignty
his
dominion
and
power
will
endure
it
will
manifest
the
signs
of
god
and
his
attributes
and
will
reveal
his
loving
kindness
and
bounty
the
movement
of
my
pen
is
stilled
when
it
attempteth
to
befittingly
describe
the
loftiness
and
glory
of
so
exalted
a
station
the
honor
with
which
the
hand
of
mercy
will
invest
the
soul
is
such
as
no
tongue
can
adequately
reveal
nor
any
other
earthly
agency
describe
blessed
is
the
soul
which
at
the
hour
of
its
separation
from
the
body
is
sanctified
from
the
vain
imaginings
of
the
peoples
of
the
world
such
a
soul
liveth
and
moveth
in
accordance
with
the
will
of
its
creator
and
entereth
the
paradise
the
maids
of
heaven
inmates
of
the
loftiest
mansions
will
circle
around
it
and
the
prophets
of
god
and
his
chosen
ones
will
seek
its
companionship
with
them
that
soul
will
freely
converse
and
will
recount
unto
them
that
which
it
hath
been
made
to
endure
in
the
path
of
god
the
lord
of
all
worlds
if
any
man
be
told
that
which
hath
been
ordained
for
such
a
soul
in
the
worlds
of
god
the
lord
of
the
throne
on
high
and
of
earth
below
his
whole
being
will
instantly
blaze
out
in
his
great
longing
to
attain
that
most
exalted
that
sanctified
and
resplendent
station
the
nature
of
the
soul
after
death
can
never
be
described
nor
is
it
meet
and
permissible
to
reveal
its
whole
character
to
the
eyes
of
men
the
prophets
and
messengers
of
god
have
been
sent
down
for
the
sole
purpose
underlying
their
revelation
hath
been
to
educate
all
men
that
they
may
at
the
hour
of
death
ascend
in
the
utmost
purity
and
sanctity
and
with
absolute
detachment
to
the
throne
of
the
most
high
the
light
which
these
souls
radiate
is
responsible
for
the
progress
of
the
world
and
the
advancement
of
its
peoples
they
are
like
unto
leaven
which
leaveneth
the
world
of
being
and
constitute
the
animating
force
through
which
the
arts
and
wonders
of
the
world
are
made
manifest
through
them
the
clouds
rain
their
bounty
upon
men
and
the
earth
bringeth
forth
its
fruits
all
things
must
needs
have
a
cause
a
motive
power
an
animating
principle
these
souls
and
symbols
of
detachment
have
provided
and
will
continue
to
provide
the
supreme
moving
impulse
in
the
world
of
being
the
world
beyond
is
as
different
from
this
world
as
this
world
is
different
from
that
of
the
child
while
still
in
the
womb
of
its
from
the
writings
of
bahá
u
lláh
pp
similarly
abdu
writes
the
mysteries
of
which
man
is
heedless
in
the
earthly
world
those
will
he
discover
in
the
heavenly
world
and
there
will
he
be
informed
of
the
secrets
of
the
truth
how
much
more
will
he
recognize
or
discover
persons
with
whom
he
has
been
associated
undoubtedly
the
holy
souls
who
find
a
pure
eye
and
are
favored
with
insight
will
in
the
kingdom
of
lights
be
acquainted
with
all
mysteries
and
will
seek
the
bounty
of
witnessing
the
reality
of
every
great
soul
they
will
even
manifestly
behold
the
beauty
of
god
in
that
world
likewise
will
they
find
all
the
friends
of
god
both
those
of
the
former
and
recent
times
present
in
the
heavenly
assemblage
the
difference
and
distinction
between
men
will
naturally
become
realized
after
their
departure
from
this
mortal
world
but
this
distinction
is
not
in
respect
to
place
but
in
respect
to
the
soul
and
the
conscience
for
the
kingdom
of
god
is
sanctified
or
free
from
time
and
place
it
is
another
world
and
another
universe
and
know
thou
for
a
certainty
that
in
the
divine
worlds
the
spiritual
beloved
ones
will
recognize
one
another
and
will
seek
union
with
each
other
but
a
spiritual
union
likewise
a
love
that
one
may
have
entertained
for
anyone
will
not
be
forgotten
in
the
world
of
the
kingdom
nor
wilt
thou
forget
there
the
life
that
thou
hadst
in
the
material
world
heaven
and
hell
bahá
u
lláh
and
abdu
regard
the
descriptions
of
heaven
and
hell
given
in
some
of
the
older
religious
writings
as
symbolic
like
the
biblical
story
of
the
creation
and
not
as
literally
true
according
to
them
heaven
is
the
state
of
perfection
and
hell
that
of
imperfection
heaven
is
harmony
with
god
s
will
and
with
our
fellows
and
hell
is
the
want
of
such
harmony
heaven
is
the
condition
of
spiritual
life
and
hell
that
of
spiritual
death
a
man
may
be
either
in
heaven
or
in
hell
while
still
in
the
body
the
joys
of
heaven
are
spiritual
joys
and
the
pains
of
hell
consist
in
the
deprivation
of
these
joys
abdu
says
when
they
men
are
delivered
through
the
light
of
faith
from
the
darkness
of
these
vices
and
become
illuminated
with
the
radiance
of
the
sun
of
reality
and
ennobled
with
all
the
virtues
they
esteem
this
the
greatest
reward
and
they
know
it
to
be
the
true
paradise
in
the
same
way
they
consider
that
the
spiritual
punishment
is
to
be
subjected
to
the
world
of
nature
to
be
veiled
from
god
to
be
brutal
and
ignorant
to
fall
into
carnal
lusts
to
be
absorbed
in
animal
frailties
to
be
characterized
with
dark
qualities
these
are
the
greatest
punishments
and
tortures
the
rewards
of
the
other
world
are
the
perfections
and
the
peace
obtained
in
the
spiritual
worlds
after
leaving
this
world
the
spiritual
graces
the
various
spiritual
gifts
in
the
kingdom
of
god
the
gaining
of
the
desires
of
the
heart
and
the
soul
and
the
meeting
of
god
in
the
world
of
eternity
in
the
same
way
the
punishments
of
the
other
world
consist
in
being
deprived
of
the
special
divine
blessings
and
the
absolute
bounties
and
falling
into
the
lowest
degrees
of
existence
he
who
is
deprived
of
these
divine
favours
although
he
continues
after
death
is
considered
as
dead
by
the
people
of
truth
the
wealth
of
the
other
world
is
nearness
to
god
consequently
it
is
certain
that
those
who
are
near
the
divine
court
are
allowed
to
intercede
and
this
intercession
is
approved
by
god
it
is
even
possible
that
the
condition
of
those
who
have
died
in
sin
and
unbelief
may
become
changed
that
is
to
say
they
may
become
the
object
of
pardon
through
the
bounty
of
god
not
through
his
justice
for
bounty
if
giving
without
desert
and
justice
is
giving
what
is
deserved
as
we
have
the
power
to
pray
for
these
souls
here
so
likewise
we
shall
possess
the
same
power
in
the
other
world
which
is
the
kingdom
of
god
therefore
in
that
world
also
they
can
make
progress
as
here
they
can
receive
light
by
their
supplications
there
also
they
can
plead
for
forgiveness
and
receive
light
through
entreaties
and
supplications
both
before
and
after
putting
off
this
material
form
there
is
progress
in
perfection
but
not
in
state
there
is
no
other
being
higher
than
a
perfect
man
but
man
when
he
has
reached
this
state
can
still
make
progress
in
perfections
but
not
in
state
because
there
is
no
state
higher
than
that
of
a
perfect
man
to
which
he
can
transfer
himself
he
only
progresses
in
the
state
of
humanity
for
the
human
perfections
are
infinite
thus
however
learned
a
man
may
be
we
can
imagine
one
more
learned
hence
as
the
perfections
of
humanity
are
endless
man
can
also
make
progress
in
perfections
after
leaving
this
answered
questions
pp
oneness
of
the
two
worlds
the
unity
of
humanity
as
taught
by
bahá
u
lláh
refers
not
only
to
men
still
in
the
flesh
but
to
all
human
beings
whether
embodied
or
disembodied
not
only
all
men
now
living
on
the
earth
but
all
in
the
spiritual
world
as
well
are
parts
of
one
and
the
same
organism
and
these
two
parts
are
intimately
dependent
one
on
the
other
spiritual
communion
one
with
the
other
far
from
being
impossible
or
unnatural
is
constant
and
inevitable
those
whose
spiritual
faculties
are
as
yet
undeveloped
are
unconscious
of
this
vital
connection
but
as
one
s
faculties
develop
communications
with
those
beyond
the
veil
gradually
become
more
conscious
and
definite
to
the
prophets
and
saints
this
spiritual
communion
is
as
familiar
and
real
as
are
ordinary
vision
and
conversation
to
the
rest
of
mankind
abdu
says
the
visions
of
the
prophets
are
not
dreams
no
they
are
spiritual
discoveries
and
have
reality
they
say
for
example
i
saw
a
person
in
a
certain
form
and
i
said
such
a
thing
and
he
gave
such
an
this
vision
is
in
the
world
of
wakefulness
and
not
in
that
of
sleep
nay
it
is
a
spiritual
discovery
among
spiritual
souls
there
are
spiritual
understandings
discoveries
a
communion
which
is
purified
from
imagination
and
fancy
an
association
which
is
sanctified
from
time
and
place
so
it
is
written
in
the
gospel
that
on
mount
tabor
moses
and
elias
came
to
christ
and
it
is
evident
that
this
was
not
a
material
meeting
it
was
a
spiritual
condition
communications
such
as
these
are
real
and
produce
wonderful
effects
in
the
minds
and
thoughts
of
men
and
cause
their
hearts
to
be
answered
questions
pp
while
admitting
the
reality
of
supernormal
psychic
faculties
he
deprecates
attempts
to
force
their
development
prematurely
these
faculties
will
unfold
naturally
when
the
right
time
comes
if
we
only
follow
the
path
of
spiritual
progress
which
the
prophets
have
traced
for
us
he
says
to
tamper
with
psychic
forces
while
in
this
world
interferes
with
the
condition
of
the
soul
in
the
world
to
come
these
forces
are
real
but
normally
are
not
active
on
this
plane
the
child
in
the
womb
has
its
eyes
ears
hands
feet
but
they
are
not
in
activity
the
whole
purpose
of
life
in
the
material
world
is
the
coming
forth
into
the
world
of
reality
where
those
forces
will
become
active
they
belong
to
that
world
from
miss
buckton
s
notes
revised
by
abdu
intercourse
with
spirits
of
the
departed
ought
not
to
be
sought
for
its
own
sake
nor
in
order
to
gratify
idle
curiosity
it
is
both
a
privilege
and
duty
however
for
those
on
one
side
of
the
veil
to
love
and
help
and
pray
for
those
on
the
other
prayers
for
the
dead
are
enjoined
on
bahá
ís
abdu
said
to
miss
rosenberg
in
the
grace
of
effective
intercession
is
one
of
the
perfections
belonging
to
advanced
souls
as
well
as
to
the
manifestation
of
god
jesus
christ
had
the
power
of
interceding
for
the
forgiveness
of
his
enemies
when
on
earth
and
he
certainly
has
this
power
now
abdu
never
mentions
the
name
of
a
dead
person
without
saying
may
god
forgive
him
or
words
to
that
effect
followers
of
the
prophets
have
also
this
power
of
praying
for
the
forgiveness
of
souls
therefore
we
may
not
think
that
any
souls
are
condemned
to
a
stationary
condition
of
suffering
or
loss
arising
from
absolute
ignorance
of
god
the
power
of
effective
intercession
for
them
always
exists
the
rich
in
the
other
world
can
help
the
poor
as
the
rich
can
help
the
poor
here
in
every
world
all
are
the
creatures
of
god
they
are
always
dependent
on
him
they
are
not
independent
and
can
never
be
so
while
they
are
needful
of
god
the
more
they
supplicate
the
richer
they
become
what
is
their
merchandise
their
wealth
in
the
other
world
what
is
help
and
assistance
it
is
intercession
undeveloped
souls
must
gain
progress
at
first
through
the
supplications
of
the
spiritually
rich
afterwards
they
can
progress
through
their
own
again
he
says
those
who
have
ascended
have
different
attributes
from
those
who
are
still
on
earth
yet
there
is
no
real
separation
in
prayer
there
is
a
mingling
of
station
a
mingling
of
condition
pray
for
them
as
they
pray
for
you
abdu
in
london
asked
whether
it
was
possible
through
faith
and
love
to
bring
the
new
revelation
to
the
knowledge
of
those
who
have
departed
from
this
life
without
hearing
of
it
abdu
replied
yes
surely
since
sincere
prayer
always
has
its
effect
and
it
has
a
great
influence
in
the
other
world
we
are
never
cut
off
from
those
who
are
there
the
real
and
genuine
influence
is
not
in
this
world
but
in
that
of
mary
hanford
ford
paris
on
the
other
hand
bahá
u
lláh
writes
he
who
lives
according
to
what
is
ordained
for
celestial
concourse
and
the
people
of
the
supreme
paradise
and
those
who
are
dwelling
in
the
dome
of
greatness
will
pray
for
him
by
a
command
from
god
the
dearest
and
the
praiseworthy
tablet
translated
by
alí
kuli
when
abdu
was
asked
how
it
was
that
the
heart
often
turns
with
instinctive
appeal
to
some
friend
who
has
passed
into
the
next
life
he
answered
it
is
a
law
of
god
s
creation
that
the
weak
should
lean
upon
the
strong
those
to
whom
you
turn
may
be
mediators
of
god
s
power
to
you
even
as
when
on
earth
but
it
is
the
one
holy
spirit
that
strengthens
all
abdu
in
london
the
nonexistence
of
evil
according
to
bahá
í
philosophy
it
follows
from
the
doctrine
of
the
unity
of
god
that
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
positive
evil
there
can
only
be
one
infinite
if
there
were
any
other
power
in
the
universe
outside
of
or
opposed
to
the
one
then
the
one
would
not
be
infinite
just
as
darkness
is
but
the
absence
or
lesser
degree
of
light
so
evil
is
but
the
absence
or
lesser
degree
of
undeveloped
state
a
bad
man
is
a
man
with
the
higher
side
of
his
nature
still
undeveloped
if
he
is
selfish
the
evil
is
not
in
his
love
of
love
even
is
good
is
divine
the
evil
is
that
he
has
such
a
poor
inadequate
misguided
love
of
self
and
such
a
lack
of
love
for
others
and
for
god
he
looks
upon
himself
as
only
a
superior
sort
of
animal
and
foolishly
pampers
his
lower
nature
as
he
might
pamper
a
pet
worse
results
in
his
own
case
than
in
that
of
the
dog
in
one
of
his
letters
abdu
says
as
to
thy
remark
that
abdu
hath
said
to
some
of
the
believers
that
evil
never
exists
nay
rather
it
is
a
nonexistent
thing
this
is
but
truth
inasmuch
as
the
greatest
evil
is
man
s
going
astray
and
being
veiled
from
truth
error
is
lack
of
guidance
darkness
is
absence
of
light
ignorance
is
lack
of
knowledge
falsehood
is
lack
of
truthfulness
blindness
is
lack
of
sight
and
deafness
is
lack
of
hearing
therefore
error
blindness
deafness
and
ignorance
are
nonexistent
things
again
he
says
in
creation
there
is
no
evil
all
is
good
certain
qualities
and
natures
innate
in
some
men
and
apparently
blameworthy
are
not
so
in
reality
for
example
from
the
beginning
of
his
life
you
can
see
in
a
nursing
child
the
signs
of
desire
of
anger
and
of
temper
then
it
may
be
said
good
and
evil
are
innate
in
the
reality
of
man
and
this
is
contrary
to
the
pure
goodness
of
nature
and
creation
the
answer
to
this
is
that
desire
which
is
to
ask
for
something
more
is
a
praiseworthy
quality
provided
that
it
is
used
suitably
so
if
a
man
has
the
desire
to
acquire
science
and
knowledge
or
to
become
compassionate
generous
and
just
it
is
most
praiseworthy
if
he
exercises
his
anger
and
wrath
against
the
bloodthirsty
tyrants
who
are
like
ferocious
beasts
it
is
very
praiseworthy
but
if
he
does
not
use
these
qualities
in
a
right
way
they
are
blameworthy
it
is
the
same
with
all
the
natural
qualities
of
man
which
constitute
the
capital
of
life
if
they
be
used
and
displayed
in
an
unlawful
way
they
become
blameworthy
therefore
it
is
clear
that
creation
is
purely
answered
questions
pp
evil
is
always
lack
of
life
if
the
lower
side
of
man
s
nature
is
disproportionately
developed
the
remedy
is
not
less
life
for
that
side
but
more
life
for
the
higher
side
so
that
the
balance
may
be
restored
i
am
come
said
christ
that
ye
may
have
life
and
that
ye
may
have
it
more
that
is
what
we
all
more
life
the
life
that
is
life
indeed
bahá
u
lláh
s
message
is
the
same
as
christ
s
today
he
says
this
servant
has
assuredly
come
to
vivify
the
world
tablet
to
ra
ís
and
to
his
followers
he
says
come
ye
after
me
that
we
may
make
you
to
become
quickeners
of
tablet
to
the
pope
chapter
religion
and
science
alí
the
of
muḥammad
said
that
which
is
in
conformity
with
science
is
also
in
conformity
with
whatever
the
intelligence
of
man
can
not
understand
religion
ought
not
to
accept
religion
and
science
walk
hand
in
hand
and
any
religion
contrary
to
science
is
not
the
abdu
wisdom
of
abdu
conflict
due
to
error
one
of
the
fundamental
teachings
of
bahá
u
lláh
is
that
true
science
and
true
religion
must
always
be
in
harmony
truth
is
one
and
whenever
conflict
appears
it
is
due
not
to
truth
but
to
error
between
science
and
religion
there
have
been
fierce
conflicts
all
down
the
ages
but
looking
back
on
these
conflicts
in
the
light
of
fuller
truth
we
can
trace
them
every
time
to
ignorance
prejudice
vanity
greed
intolerance
obstinacy
or
something
of
the
foreign
to
the
true
spirit
of
both
science
and
religion
for
the
spirit
of
both
is
one
as
huxley
tells
us
the
great
deeds
of
philosophers
have
been
less
the
fruit
of
their
intellect
than
the
direction
of
that
intellect
by
an
eminently
religious
tone
of
mind
truth
has
yielded
herself
rather
to
their
patience
their
love
their
and
than
to
their
logical
boole
the
mathematician
assures
us
that
geometric
induction
is
essentially
a
process
of
appeal
from
the
finite
mind
to
the
infinite
for
light
on
finite
the
great
prophets
of
religion
and
science
have
never
denounced
each
other
it
is
the
unworthy
followers
of
these
great
world
of
the
letter
but
not
of
the
spirit
of
their
have
always
been
the
persecutors
of
the
later
prophets
and
the
bitterest
opponents
of
progress
they
have
studied
the
light
of
the
particular
revelation
which
they
hold
sacred
and
have
defined
its
properties
and
peculiarities
as
seen
by
their
limited
vision
with
the
utmost
care
and
precision
that
is
for
them
the
one
true
light
if
god
in
his
infinite
bounty
sends
fuller
light
from
another
quarter
and
the
torch
of
inspiration
burns
brighter
than
before
from
a
new
torchholder
instead
of
welcoming
the
new
lights
they
are
angry
and
alarmed
this
new
light
does
not
correspond
with
their
definitions
it
has
not
the
orthodox
color
and
does
not
shine
from
the
orthodox
place
therefore
it
must
at
all
costs
be
extinguished
lest
it
lead
men
astray
into
the
paths
of
heresy
many
enemies
of
the
prophets
are
of
this
leaders
of
the
blind
who
oppose
new
and
fuller
truth
in
the
supposed
interests
of
what
they
believe
to
be
the
truth
others
are
of
baser
sort
and
are
moved
by
selfish
interests
to
fight
against
truth
or
else
block
the
path
of
progress
by
reason
of
spiritual
deadness
and
inertia
persecution
of
prophets
the
great
prophets
of
religion
have
always
been
at
their
coming
despised
and
rejected
of
men
both
they
and
their
early
followers
have
given
their
backs
to
the
smiters
and
sacrificed
their
possessions
and
their
lives
in
the
path
of
god
even
in
our
own
times
this
has
been
so
since
many
thousands
of
bábís
and
bahá
ís
in
persia
have
suffered
cruel
deaths
for
their
faith
and
many
more
have
borne
imprisonment
exile
poverty
and
degradation
the
latest
of
the
great
religions
has
been
baptized
in
blood
more
than
its
predecessors
and
martyrdoms
have
continued
down
to
the
present
day
with
the
prophets
of
science
the
same
thing
has
happened
giordano
bruno
was
burned
as
a
heretic
in
for
teaching
amongst
other
things
that
the
earth
moved
around
the
sun
a
few
years
later
the
veteran
philosopher
galileo
had
to
abjure
the
same
doctrine
on
his
knees
in
order
to
escape
a
similar
fate
in
later
times
darwin
and
the
pioneers
of
modern
geology
were
vehemently
denounced
for
daring
to
dispute
the
teaching
of
holy
write
that
the
world
was
made
in
six
days
and
less
than
six
thousand
years
ago
the
opposition
to
new
scientific
truth
has
not
all
come
from
the
church
however
the
orthodox
in
science
have
been
just
as
hostile
to
progress
as
the
orthodox
in
religion
columbus
was
laughed
to
scorn
by
the
scientists
of
his
day
who
proved
to
their
own
satisfaction
that
if
ships
did
succeed
in
getting
down
to
the
antipodes
over
the
side
of
the
globe
it
would
be
absolutely
impossible
for
them
to
get
up
again
galvani
the
pioneer
of
electrical
science
was
scoffed
at
by
his
learned
colleagues
and
called
the
frogs
dancing
harvey
who
discovered
the
circulation
of
the
blood
was
ridiculed
and
persecuted
by
his
professional
brethren
on
account
of
his
heresy
and
driven
from
his
lecture
chair
when
stephenson
invented
his
locomotive
engine
european
mathematicians
of
the
time
instead
of
opening
their
eyes
and
studying
the
facts
continued
for
years
to
prove
to
their
own
satisfaction
that
an
engine
on
smooth
rails
could
never
pull
a
load
as
the
wheels
would
simply
slip
round
and
round
and
the
train
make
no
progress
to
examples
like
these
one
might
add
indefinitely
both
from
ancient
and
modern
history
and
even
from
our
own
times
zamenhof
the
inventor
of
esperanto
had
to
battle
for
his
wonderful
international
language
against
the
same
sort
of
ridicule
contempt
and
stupid
opposition
which
greeted
columbus
galvani
and
stephenson
even
esperanto
which
was
given
to
the
world
so
recently
as
has
had
its
martyrs
the
dawn
of
reconciliation
in
the
last
half
century
or
so
however
a
change
has
come
over
the
spirit
of
the
times
a
new
light
of
truth
has
arisen
which
has
already
made
the
controversies
of
last
century
seem
strangely
out
of
date
where
are
now
the
boastful
materialists
and
dogmatic
atheists
who
only
a
few
short
years
ago
were
threatening
to
drive
religion
out
of
the
world
and
where
are
the
preachers
who
so
confidently
consigned
those
who
did
not
accept
their
dogmas
to
the
fires
of
hell
and
the
tortures
of
the
damned
echoes
of
their
clamor
we
may
still
hear
but
their
day
is
fast
declining
and
their
doctrines
are
being
discredited
we
can
see
now
that
the
doctrines
around
which
their
controversies
waxed
most
bitter
were
neither
true
science
nor
true
religion
what
scientist
in
the
light
of
modern
psychical
research
could
still
maintain
that
brain
secretes
thought
as
the
liver
secretes
bile
or
that
decay
of
the
body
is
necessarily
accompanied
by
decay
of
the
soul
we
now
see
that
thought
to
be
really
free
must
soar
to
the
realms
of
psychical
and
spiritual
phenomena
and
not
be
confined
to
the
material
only
we
realize
that
what
we
now
know
about
nature
is
but
as
a
drop
in
the
ocean
compared
with
what
remains
to
be
discovered
we
therefore
freely
admit
the
possibility
of
miracles
not
indeed
in
the
sense
of
the
breaking
of
nature
s
laws
but
as
manifestations
of
the
operation
of
subtle
forces
which
are
still
unknown
to
us
as
electricity
and
x
rays
were
to
our
ancestors
on
the
other
hand
who
amongst
our
leading
religious
teachers
would
still
declare
it
is
necessary
to
salvation
to
believe
that
the
world
was
made
in
six
days
or
that
the
description
of
the
plagues
in
egypt
as
given
in
the
book
of
exodus
is
literally
true
or
that
the
sun
stood
still
in
the
heavens
that
is
that
the
earth
stopped
its
rotation
to
let
joshua
pursue
his
enemies
or
that
if
a
man
accept
not
the
creed
of
athanasius
without
doubt
he
shall
perish
everlastingly
such
beliefs
may
still
be
repeated
in
form
but
who
accepts
them
in
their
literal
sense
and
without
reservation
their
hold
on
people
s
hearts
and
minds
has
gone
or
is
fast
going
the
religious
world
owes
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
the
men
of
science
who
helped
to
tear
such
creeds
and
dogmas
to
tatters
and
allowed
the
truth
to
step
forth
free
but
the
scientific
world
owes
an
even
heavier
debt
to
the
real
saints
and
mystics
who
through
good
report
and
ill
held
to
the
vital
truths
of
spiritual
existence
and
demonstrated
to
an
incredulous
world
that
the
life
is
more
than
meat
and
the
unseen
greater
than
the
seen
these
scientists
and
saints
were
like
the
mountain
peaks
which
caught
the
first
rays
of
the
rising
sun
and
reflected
them
to
the
lower
world
but
now
the
sun
has
risen
and
its
rays
are
illuminating
the
world
in
the
teachings
of
bahá
u
lláh
we
have
a
glorious
revelation
of
truth
which
satisfies
both
heart
and
mind
in
which
religion
and
science
are
at
one
search
after
truth
complete
harmony
with
science
is
evident
in
the
bahá
í
teachings
regarding
the
way
in
which
we
must
seek
the
truth
man
must
cut
himself
free
from
all
prejudice
so
that
he
may
search
after
truth
unhindered
abdu
says
in
order
to
find
truth
we
must
give
up
our
prejudices
our
own
small
trivial
notions
an
open
receptive
mind
is
essential
if
our
chalice
is
full
of
self
there
is
no
room
in
it
for
the
water
of
life
the
fact
that
we
imagine
ourselves
to
be
right
and
everybody
else
wrong
is
the
greatest
of
all
obstacles
in
the
path
towards
unity
and
unity
is
essential
if
we
would
reach
truth
for
truth
is
one
no
one
truth
can
contradict
another
truth
light
is
good
in
whatsoever
lamp
it
is
burning
a
rose
is
beautiful
in
whatsoever
garden
it
may
bloom
a
star
has
the
same
radiance
if
it
shines
from
the
east
or
from
the
west
be
free
from
prejudice
so
will
you
love
the
sun
of
truth
from
whatever
point
in
the
horizon
it
may
arise
you
will
realize
that
if
the
divine
light
of
truth
shone
in
jesus
christ
it
also
shone
in
moses
and
buddha
this
is
what
is
meant
by
the
search
after
truth
it
also
means
that
we
must
be
willing
to
clear
away
all
that
we
have
previously
learned
all
that
would
clog
our
steps
on
the
way
to
truth
we
must
not
shrink
if
necessary
from
beginning
our
education
all
over
again
we
must
not
allow
our
love
for
any
one
religion
or
any
one
personality
so
to
blind
our
eyes
that
we
become
fettered
by
superstition
when
we
are
freed
from
all
these
bonds
seeking
with
liberal
minds
then
shall
we
be
able
to
arrive
at
our
goal
the
agnosticism
the
bahá
í
teaching
is
at
one
with
science
and
philosophy
in
declaring
the
essential
nature
of
god
to
be
entirely
beyond
human
comprehension
as
emphatically
as
thomas
huxley
and
herbert
spencer
teach
that
the
nature
of
the
great
first
cause
is
unknowable
does
bahá
u
lláh
teach
that
god
comprehends
all
he
can
not
be
to
knowledge
of
the
divine
essence
the
way
is
barred
and
road
is
impassable
for
how
can
the
finite
comprehend
the
infinite
how
can
a
drop
contain
the
ocean
or
a
mote
dancing
in
the
sunbeam
embrace
the
universe
yet
the
whole
universe
is
eloquent
of
god
in
each
drop
of
water
are
hidden
oceans
of
meaning
and
in
each
mote
is
concealed
a
whole
universe
of
significances
reaching
far
beyond
the
ken
of
the
most
learned
scientist
the
chemist
and
physicist
pursuing
their
researches
into
the
nature
of
matter
have
passed
from
masses
to
molecules
from
molecules
to
atoms
from
atoms
to
electrons
and
ether
but
at
every
step
the
difficulties
of
the
research
increase
till
the
most
profound
intellect
can
penetrate
no
farther
and
can
but
bow
in
silent
awe
before
the
unknown
infinite
which
remains
ever
shrouded
in
inscrutable
mystery
flower
in
the
crannied
wall
i
pluck
you
out
of
the
crannies
i
hold
you
here
root
and
all
in
my

little
if
i
could
understand
what
you
are
root
and
all
and
all
in
all
i
should
know
what
god
and
man
if
the
flower
in
the
crannied
wall
if
even
a
single
atom
of
matter
present
mysteries
which
the
most
profound
intellect
can
not
solve
how
is
it
possible
for
man
to
comprehend
the
universe
how
dare
he
pretend
to
define
or
describe
the
infinite
cause
of
all
things
all
theological
speculations
about
the
nature
of
god
s
essence
are
thus
swept
aside
as
foolish
and
futile
knowledge
of
god
but
if
the
essence
is
unknowable
the
manifestations
of
its
bounty
are
everywhere
apparent
if
the
first
cause
can
not
be
conceived
its
effects
appeal
to
our
every
faculty
just
as
knowledge
of
a
painter
s
pictures
gives
to
the
connoisseur
a
true
knowledge
of
the
artist
so
knowledge
of
the
universe
in
any
of
its
of
nature
or
of
human
nature
of
things
visible
or
of
things
knowledge
of
god
s
handiwork
and
gives
to
the
seeker
for
divine
truth
a
real
knowledge
of
his
glory
the
heavens
declare
the
glory
of
god
and
the
firmament
sheweth
his
handywork
day
unto
day
uttereth
speech
and
night
unto
night
sheweth
xix
the
divine
manifestations
all
things
manifest
the
bounty
of
god
with
greater
or
less
clearness
as
all
material
objects
exposed
to
the
sun
reflect
its
light
in
greater
or
less
degree
a
heap
of
soot
reflects
a
little
a
stone
reflects
more
a
piece
of
chalk
more
still
but
in
none
of
these
reflections
can
we
trace
the
form
and
color
of
the
glorious
orb
a
perfect
mirror
however
reflects
the
sun
s
very
form
and
color
so
that
looking
into
it
is
like
looking
at
the
sun
itself
so
it
is
with
the
way
in
which
things
speak
to
us
of
god
the
stone
can
tell
us
something
of
the
divine
attributes
the
flower
can
tell
us
more
the
animal
with
its
marvelous
senses
instincts
and
power
of
movement
more
still
in
the
lowest
of
our
fellowmen
we
can
trace
wonderful
faculties
which
tell
of
a
wonderful
creator
in
the
poet
the
saint
the
genius
we
find
a
higher
revelation
still
but
the
great
prophets
and
founders
of
religions
are
the
perfect
mirrors
by
which
the
love
and
wisdom
of
god
are
reflected
to
the
rest
of
mankind
other
men
s
mirrors
are
dulled
by
the
stains
and
the
dust
of
selfishness
and
prejudice
but
these
are
pure
and
without
devoted
to
the
will
of
god
thus
they
become
the
greatest
educators
of
mankind
the
divine
teachings
and
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
proceeding
through
them
have
been
and
are
the
cause
of
the
progress
of
humanity
for
god
helps
men
through
other
men
each
man
who
is
higher
in
the
ascent
of
life
is
the
means
of
helping
those
who
are
lower
and
those
who
are
the
highest
of
all
are
the
helpers
of
all
mankind
it
is
as
if
all
men
were
connected
together
by
elastic
cords
if
a
man
rises
a
little
above
the
general
level
of
his
fellows
the
cords
tighten
his
former
companions
tend
to
draw
him
back
but
with
an
equal
force
he
draws
them
upwards
the
higher
he
gets
the
more
he
feels
the
weight
of
the
whole
world
pulling
him
back
and
the
more
dependent
he
is
on
the
divine
support
which
reaches
him
through
the
few
who
are
still
above
him
highest
of
all
are
the
great
prophets
and
saviors
the
divine
manifestations
perfect
men
who
were
each
in
their
day
without
peer
or
companion
and
bore
the
burden
of
the
whole
world
supported
by
god
alone
the
burden
of
our
sins
was
upon
him
was
true
of
each
of
them
each
was
the
way
the
truth
and
the
life
to
his
followers
each
was
the
channel
of
god
s
bounty
to
every
heart
that
would
receive
it
each
had
his
part
to
play
in
the
great
divine
plan
for
the
upliftment
of
humanity
creation
bahá
u
lláh
teaches
that
the
universe
is
without
beginning
in
time
it
is
a
perpetual
emanation
from
the
great
first
cause
the
creator
always
had
his
creation
and
always
will
have
worlds
and
systems
may
come
and
go
but
the
universe
remains
all
things
that
undergo
composition
in
time
undergo
decomposition
but
the
component
elements
remain
the
creation
of
a
world
a
daisy
or
a
human
body
is
not
making
something
out
of
nothing
it
is
rather
a
bringing
together
of
elements
which
before
were
scattered
a
making
visible
of
something
which
before
was
hidden
by
and
by
the
elements
will
again
be
scattered
the
form
will
disappear
but
nothing
is
really
lost
or
annihilated
ever
new
combinations
and
forms
arise
from
the
ruins
of
the
old
bahá
u
lláh
confirms
the
scientists
who
claim
not
six
thousand
but
millions
and
billions
of
years
for
the
history
of
the
earth
s
creation
the
evolution
theory
does
not
deny
creative
power
it
only
tries
to
describe
the
method
of
its
manifestation
and
the
wonderful
story
of
the
material
universe
which
the
astronomer
the
geologist
the
physicist
and
the
biologist
are
gradually
unfolding
to
our
gaze
is
rightly
appreciated
far
more
capable
of
evoking
the
deepest
reverence
and
worship
than
the
crude
and
bald
account
of
creation
given
in
the
hebrew
scriptures
the
old
account
in
the
book
of
genesis
had
however
the
advantage
of
indicating
by
a
few
bold
strokes
of
symbolism
the
essential
spiritual
meanings
of
the
story
as
a
master
painter
may
by
a
few
strokes
of
the
brush
convey
expressions
which
the
mere
plodder
with
the
most
laborious
attention
to
details
may
utterly
fail
to
portray
if
the
material
details
blind
us
to
the
spiritual
meaning
then
we
should
be
better
without
them
but
if
we
have
once
firmly
grasped
the
essential
meaning
of
the
whole
scheme
then
knowledge
of
the
details
will
give
our
conception
a
wonderful
added
richness
and
splendor
and
make
it
a
magnificent
picture
instead
of
a
mere
sketch
plan
abdu
says
know
that
it
is
one
of
the
most
abstruse
spiritual
truths
that
the
world
of
existence
that
is
to
say
this
endless
universe
has
no
beginning
know
that
a
creator
without
a
creature
is
impossible
a
provider
without
those
provided
for
can
not
be
conceived
for
all
the
divine
names
and
attributes
demand
the
existence
of
beings
if
we
could
imagine
a
time
when
no
beings
existed
this
imagination
would
be
the
denial
of
the
divinity
of
god
moreover
absolute
can
not
become
existence
if
the
beings
were
absolutely
existence
would
not
have
come
into
being
therefore
as
the
essence
of
unity
that
is
the
existence
of
god
is
everlasting
and
is
to
say
it
has
neither
beginning
nor
is
certain
that
this
world
of
existence
has
neither
beginning
nor
end
it
may
be
that
one
of
the
parts
of
the
universe
one
of
the
globes
for
example
may
come
into
existence
or
may
be
disintegrated
but
the
other
endless
globes
are
still
existing
as
each
globe
has
a
beginning
necessarily
it
has
an
end
because
every
composition
collective
or
particular
must
of
necessity
be
decomposed
the
only
difference
is
that
some
are
quickly
decomposed
and
others
more
slowly
but
it
is
impossible
that
a
composed
thing
should
not
eventually
be
answered
questions
pp
the
evolution
of
man
bahá
u
lláh
also
confirms
the
biologist
who
finds
for
the
body
of
man
a
history
reaching
back
in
the
development
of
the
species
through
millions
of
years
starting
from
a
very
simple
apparently
insignificant
form
the
human
body
is
pictured
as
developing
stage
by
stage
in
the
course
of
untold
generations
becoming
more
and
more
complex
and
better
and
better
organized
until
the
man
of
the
present
day
is
reached
each
individual
human
body
develops
through
such
a
series
of
stages
from
a
tiny
round
speck
of
matter
to
the
fully
developed
man
if
this
is
true
of
the
individual
as
nobody
denies
why
should
we
consider
it
derogatory
to
human
dignity
to
admit
a
similar
development
for
the
species
this
is
a
very
different
thing
from
claiming
that
man
is
descended
from
a
monkey
the
human
embryo
may
at
one
time
resemble
a
fish
with
and
tail
but
it
is
not
a
fish
it
is
a
human
embryo
so
the
human
species
may
at
various
stages
of
its
long
development
have
resembled
to
the
outward
eye
various
species
of
lower
animals
but
it
was
still
the
human
species
possessing
the
mysterious
latent
power
of
developing
into
man
as
we
know
him
today
nay
more
of
developing
in
the
future
we
trust
into
something
far
higher
still
abdu
says
it
is
clear
that
this
terrestrial
globe
in
its
present
form
did
not
come
into
existence
all
at
once
but
gradually
passed
through
different
phases
until
it
became
adorned
with
its
present
perfection
man
in
the
beginning
of
his
existence
and
in
the
womb
of
the
earth
like
the
embryo
in
the
womb
of
the
mother
gradually
grew
and
developed
and
passed
from
one
form
to
another
until
he
appeared
with
this
beauty
and
perfection
this
force
and
this
power
it
is
certain
that
in
the
beginning
he
had
not
this
loveliness
and
grace
and
elegance
and
that
he
only
by
degrees
attained
this
shape
this
form
this
beauty
and
this
grace
man
s
existence
on
this
earth
from
the
beginning
until
it
reaches
this
state
form
and
condition
necessarily
lasts
a
long
time
but
from
the
beginning
of
man
s
existence
he
is
a
distinct
species
admitting
that
the
traces
of
organs
which
have
disappeared
actually
exist
in
the
human
body
this
is
not
a
proof
of
the
impermanence
and
the
of
the
species
at
the
most
it
proves
that
the
form
and
fashion
and
the
organs
of
man
have
progressed
man
was
always
a
distinct
species
a
man
not
an
answered
questions
pp
of
the
story
of
adam
and
eve
he
says
if
we
take
this
story
in
its
apparent
meaning
according
to
the
interpretation
of
the
masses
it
is
indeed
extraordinary
the
intelligence
can
not
accept
it
affirm
it
or
imagine
it
for
such
arrangements
such
details
such
speeches
and
reproaches
are
far
from
being
those
of
an
intelligent
man
how
must
less
of
the
divinity
who
has
organised
this
infinite
universe
in
the
most
perfect
form
and
its
innumerable
inhabitants
with
absolute
system
strength
and
perfection
therefore
this
story
of
adam
and
eve
who
ate
from
the
tree
and
their
expulsion
from
paradise
must
be
thought
of
simply
as
a
symbol
it
contains
divine
mysteries
and
universal
meanings
and
it
is
capable
of
marvellous
answered
questions
body
and
soul
the
bahá
í
teachings
with
regard
to
body
and
soul
and
the
life
after
death
are
quite
in
harmony
with
the
results
of
psychical
research
they
teach
as
we
have
seen
that
death
is
but
a
new
escape
from
the
prison
of
the
body
into
a
larger
life
and
that
progress
in
the
afterlife
is
limitless
a
large
body
of
scientific
evidence
has
gradually
been
accumulating
which
in
the
opinion
of
impartial
but
highly
critical
investigators
is
amply
sufficient
to
establish
beyond
all
question
the
fact
of
a
life
after
the
continued
life
and
activity
of
the
conscious
soul
after
the
dissolution
of
the
material
body
as
myers
says
in
his
human
personality
a
work
which
summarizes
many
of
the
investigations
of
the
psychical
research
society
observation
experiment
inference
have
led
many
inquirers
of
whom
i
am
one
to
a
belief
in
direct
or
telepathic
intercommunication
not
between
the
minds
of
men
still
on
earth
only
but
between
minds
or
spirits
still
on
earth
and
spirits
departed
such
a
discovery
opens
the
doors
also
to
revelation
we
have
shown
that
amid
much
deception
and
fraud
and
illusion
veritable
manifestations
do
reach
us
from
beyond
the
grave
by
discovery
and
by
revelation
certain
theses
have
been
provisionally
established
with
regard
to
such
departed
souls
as
we
have
been
able
to
encounter
first
and
chiefly
i
at
least
see
ground
to
believe
that
their
state
is
one
of
endless
evolution
in
wisdom
and
in
love
their
loves
of
earth
persist
and
most
of
all
those
highest
loves
which
find
their
outlet
in
adoration
and
worship
evil
to
them
seems
less
a
terrible
than
a
slavish
thing
it
is
embodied
in
no
mighty
potentate
rather
it
forms
as
isolating
madness
from
which
higher
spirits
strive
to
free
the
distorted
soul
there
needs
no
chastisement
of
fire
is
man
s
punishment
and
his
reward
and
the
nearness
or
the
aloofness
of
companion
souls
for
in
that
world
love
is
actually
the
communion
of
saints
not
only
adorns
but
constitutes
the
life
everlasting
nay
from
the
laws
of
telepathy
it
follows
that
that
communion
is
valid
to
us
here
and
now
even
now
the
love
of
souls
departed
makes
answer
to
our
invocations
even
now
our
loving
is
itself
a
and
strengthens
those
delivered
spirits
upon
their
upward
way
the
measure
of
agreement
between
this
view
which
is
founded
on
careful
scientific
research
and
that
of
the
bahá
í
teachings
is
truly
remarkable
unity
of
mankind
ye
are
all
fruits
of
one
tree
the
leaves
of
one
branch
the
flowers
of
one
that
is
one
of
the
most
characteristic
sayings
of
bahá
u
lláh
and
another
is
like
it
glory
is
not
his
who
loves
his
own
country
but
glory
is
his
who
loves
his
of
mankind
and
of
all
created
beings
in
the
main
theme
of
his
teaching
here
again
the
harmony
between
true
religion
and
science
is
evident
with
every
advance
in
science
the
oneness
of
the
universe
and
the
interdependence
of
its
parts
has
become
more
clearly
evident
the
astronomer
s
domain
is
inseparably
bound
up
with
physicist
s
and
the
physicist
s
with
the
chemist
s
the

s
with
the
biologist
s
the
biologist
s
with
the
psychologist
s
and
so
on
every
new
discovery
in
one
field
of
research
throws
new
light
on
other
fields
just
as
physical
science
has
shown
that
every
particle
of
matter
in
the
universe
attracts
and
influences
every
other
particle
no
matter
how
minute
or
how
distant
so
psychical
science
is
finding
that
every
soul
in
the
universe
affects
and
influences
every
other
soul
prince
kropotkin
in
his
book
on
mutual
aid
shows
most
clearly
that
even
among
the
lower
animals
mutual
aid
is
absolutely
necessary
to
continued
life
while
in
the
case
of
man
the
progress
of
civilization
depends
on
the
increasing
substitution
of
mutual
aid
for
mutual
enmity
each
for
all
and
all
for
each
is
the
only
principle
on
which
a
community
can
prosper
the
era
of
unity
all
the
signs
of
the
times
indicate
that
we
are
at
the
dawn
of
a
new
era
in
the
history
of
mankind
hitherto
the
young
eagle
of
humanity
has
clung
to
the
old
aerie
in
the
solid
rock
of
selfishness
and
materialism
its
attempts
to
use
its
wings
have
been
timid
and
tentative
it
has
had
restless
longings
for
something
still
unattained
more
and
more
it
has
been
chafing
in
the
confinement
of
the
old
dogmas
and
orthodoxies
but
now
the
era
of
confinement
is
at
an
end
and
it
can
launch
on
the
wings
of
faith
and
reason
into
the
higher
realms
of
spiritual
love
and
truth
it
will
no
longer
be
earthbound
as
it
was
before
its
wings
had
grown
but
will
soar
at
will
to
the
regions
of
wide
outlook
and
glorious
freedom
one
thing
is
necessary
however
if
its
flight
is
to
be
sure
and
steady
its
wings
must
not
only
be
strong
but
they
must
act
in
perfect
harmony
and
coordination
as
abdu
says
it
can
not
fly
with
one
wing
alone
if
it
tries
to
fly
with
the
wing
of
religion
alone
it
will
land
in
the
slough
of
superstition
and
if
it
tries
to
fly
with
the
wing
of
science
alone
it
will
end
in
the
dreary
bog
of
perfect
harmony
between
religion
and
science
is
the
sine
qua
non
of
the
higher
life
for
humanity
when
that
is
achieved
and
every
child
is
trained
not
only
in
the
study
of
the
sciences
and
arts
but
equally
in
love
to
all
mankind
and
in
radiant
acquiescence
to
the
will
of
god
as
revealed
in
the
progress
of
evolution
and
the
teachings
of
the
prophets
then
and
not
till
then
shall
the
kingdom
of
god
come
and
his
will
be
done
on
earth
as
it
is
in
heaven
then
and
not
till
then
shall
the
most
great
peace
shed
its
blessings
on
the
world
when
religion
says
abdu
shorn
of
its
superstitions
traditions
and
unintelligent
dogmas
shows
its
conformity
with
science
then
there
will
be
a
great
unifying
cleansing
force
in
the
world
which
will
sweep
before
it
all
wars
disagreements
discords
and
struggles
and
then
will
mankind
be
united
in
the
power
of
the
love
of
chapter
prophecies
fulfilled
by
the
bahá
í
movement
as
to
the
manifestation
of
the
greatest
name
bahá
u
lláh
this
is
he
whom
god
promised
in
all
his
books
and
scriptures
such
as
the
bible
the
gospels
and
the
qur
abdu
interpretation
of
prophecy
the
interpretation
of
prophecy
is
notoriously
difficult
and
on
no
subject
do
the
opinions
of
the
learned
differ
more
widely
this
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
for
according
to
the
revealed
writings
themselves
many
of
the
prophecies
were
given
in
such
a
form
that
they
could
not
be
fully
understood
until
the
fulfillment
came
and
even
then
only
by
those
who
were
pure
in
heart
and
free
from
prejudice
thus
at
the
end
of
daniel
s
visions
the
seer
was
told
but
thou
o
daniel
shut
up
the
words
and
seal
the
book
even
to
the
time
of
the
end
many
shall
run
to
and
fro
and
knowledge
shall
be
increased
and
i
heard
but
i
understood
not
then
said
i
o
my
lord
what
shall
be
the
end
of
these
things
and
he
said
go
thy
way
daniel
for
the
words
are
closed
up
and
sealed
till
the
time
of
the
xii
if
god
sealed
up
the
prophecies
until
the
appointed
time
and
did
not
fully
reveal
the
interpretation
even
to
the
prophets
who
uttered
them
we
may
expect
that
none
but
the
appointed
messenger
of
god
will
be
able
to
break
the
seal
and
disclose
the
meanings
concealed
in
the
casket
of
the
prophetic
parables
reflection
on
the
history
of
prophecies
and
their
misinterpretation
in
previous
ages
and
dispensations
combined
with
the
solemn
warnings
of
the
prophets
themselves
should
render
us
very
chary
of
accepting
the
speculations
of
theologians
as
to
the
real
meaning
of
these
utterances
and
the
manner
of
their
fulfillment
on
the
other
hand
when
someone
appears
who
claims
to
fulfill
the
prophecies
it
is
important
that
we
examine
his
claim
with
open
unprejudiced
minds
should
he
be
an
impostor
the
fraud
will
soon
be
discovered
and
no
harm
will
be
done
but
woe
to
all
who
carelessly
turn
god
s
messenger
from
the
door
because
he
comes
in
an
unexpected
form
or
time
the
life
and
utterances
of
bahá
u
lláh
testify
that
he
is
the
promised
one
of
all
the
holy
books
who
has
the
power
to
break
the
seals
of
the
prophecies
and
to
pour
forth
the
sealed
choice
wine
of
the
divine
mysteries
let
us
hasten
then
to
hear
his
explanations
and
to
reexamine
in
their
light
the
familiar
but
often
mysterious
words
spoken
by
the
prophets
of
old
the
coming
of
the
lord
the
coming
of
the
lord
in
the
last
days
is
the
one
divine
event
to
which
all
the
prophets
look
forward
about
which
their
most
glorious
songs
are
sung
now
what
is
meant
by
the
coming
of
the
lord
surely
god
is
at
all
times
with
his
creatures
in
all
through
all
and
over
all
closer
is
he
than
breathing
nearer
than
hands
and
yes
but
men
can
not
see
or
hear
god
immanent
and
transcendent
can
not
realize
his
presence
until
he
reveals
himself
through
a
visible
form
and
talks
to
them
in
human
language
for
the
revelation
of
his
higher
attributes
god
has
always
made
use
of
a
human
instrument
each
of
the
prophets
was
a
mediator
through
whom
god
visited
and
spoke
to
his
people
jesus
was
such
a
mediator
and
the
christians
have
rightly
regarded
his
appearance
as
a
coming
of
god
in
him
they
saw
the
face
of
god
and
through
his
lips
they
heard
the
voice
of
god
bahá
u
lláh
tells
us
that
the
coming
of
the
lord
of
hosts
the
everlasting
father
the
maker
and
redeemer
of
the
world
which
according
to
all
the
prophets
is
to
take
place
at
the
time
of
the
end
means
no
other
than
his
manifestation
in
a
human
temple
as
he
manifested
through
the
temple
of
jesus
of
nazareth
only
this
time
with
a
fuller
and
more
glorious
revelation
for
which
jesus
and
all
the
former
prophets
came
to
prepare
men
s
hearts
and
minds
prophecies
about
christ
through
failing
to
understand
the
meaning
of
the
prophecies
about
the
dominion
of
the
messiah
the
jews
rejected
christ
abdu
says
the
jews
still
await
the
coming
of
the
messiah
and
pray
to
god
day
and
night
to
hasten
his
advent
when
jesus
came
they
denounced
and
slew
him
saying
this
is
not
the
one
for
whom
we
wait
behold
when
the
messiah
shall
come
signs
and
wonders
shall
testify
that
he
is
in
truth
the
christ
the
messiah
will
arise
out
of
an
unknown
city
he
shall
sit
upon
the
throne
of
david
and
behold
he
shall
come
with
a
sword
of
steel
and
with
a
scepter
of
iron
shall
he
rule
he
shall
fulfill
the
law
of
the
prophets
he
shall
conquer
the
east
and
the
west
and
shall
glorify
his
chosen
people
the
jews
he
shall
bring
with
him
a
reign
of
peace
during
which
even
the
animals
shall
cease
to
be
at
enmity
with
man
for
behold
the
wolf
and
the
lamb
shall
drink
from
the
same
spring
and
all
god
s
creatures
shall
be
at
rest
thus
the
jews
thought
and
spoke
for
they
did
not
understand
the
scriptures
nor
the
glorious
truths
that
were
contained
in
them
the
letter
they
knew
by
heart
but
of
the
spirit
they
understood
not
a
word
hearken
and
i
will
show
you
the
meaning
thereof
although
christ
came
from
nazareth
which
was
a
known
place
he
came
also
from
heaven
his
body
was
born
of
mary
but
his
spirit
came
from
heaven
the
sword
he
carried
was
the
sword
of
his
tongue
with
which
he
divided
the
good
from
the
evil
the
true
from
the
false
the
faithful
from
the
unfaithful
and
the
light
from
the
darkness
his
word
was
indeed
a
sharp
sword
the
throne
upon
which
he
sat
is
the
eternal
throne
from
which
christ
reigns
forever
a
heavenly
throne
not
an
earthly
one
for
the
things
of
earth
pass
away
but
heavenly
things
pass
not
away
he
reinterpreted
and
completed
the
laws
of
moses
and
fulfilled
the
law
of
the
prophets
his
word
conquered
the
east
and
the
west
his
kingdom
is
everlasting
he
exalted
those
jews
who
recognized
him
they
were
men
and
women
of
humble
birth
but
contact
with
him
made
them
great
and
gave
them
everlasting
dignity
the
animals
who
were
to
live
with
one
another
signified
the
different
sects
and
races
who
once
having
been
at
war
were
now
to
dwell
in
love
and
charity
drinking
together
the
water
of
life
from
christ
the
eternal
spring
most
christians
accept
these
interpretations
of
messianic
prophecies
as
applied
to
christ
but
with
regard
to
similar
prophecies
about
the
messiah
many
of
them
take
up
the
same
attitude
as
the
jews
expecting
a
miraculous
display
on
the
material
plane
which
will
fulfill
the
very
letter
of
the
prophecies
prophecies
about
the
báb
and
bahá
u
lláh
according
to
the
bahá
í
interpretations
the
prophecies
which
speak
of
the
time
of
the
end
the
last
days
the
coming
of
the
lord
of
hosts
of
the
everlasting
father
refer
especially
not
to
the
advent
of
jesus
christ
but
to
that
of
bahá
u
lláh
take
for
instance
the
prophecy
in
isaiah
the
people
that
walked
in
darkness
have
seen
a
great
light
they
that
dwell
in
the
land
of
the
shadow
of
death
upon
them
hath
the
light
shined
for
thou
hast
broken
the
yoke
of
his
burden
and
the
staff
of
his
shoulder
the
rod
of
his
oppressor
as
in
the
day
of
midian
for
every
battle
of
the
warrior
is
with
confused
noise
and
garments
rolled
in
blood
but
this
shall
be
with
burning
and
fuel
of
fire
for
unto
us
a
child
is
born
unto
us
a
son
is
given
and
the
government
shall
be
upon
his
shoulder
and
his
name
shall
be
called
wonderful
counsellor
the
might
god
the
everlasting
father
the
prince
of
peace
of
the
increase
of
his
government
and
peace
there
shall
be
no
end
upon
the
throne
of
david
and
upon
his
kingdom
to
order
it
and
to
establish
it
with
judgment
and
with
justice
from
henceforth
even
for
ever
the
zeal
of
the
lord
of
hosts
will
perform
ix
this
is
one
of
the
prophecies
that
has
often
been
regarded
as
referring
to
christ
and
must
of
it
may
quite
fairly
be
thus
applied
but
a
little
examination
will
show
how
much
more
fully
and
aptly
it
applies
to
bahá
u
lláh
christ
has
indeed
been
a
and
savior
but
for
nearly
two
thousand
years
since
his
advent
the
great
majority
of
the
people
of
the
earth
have
continued
to
walk
in
darkness
and
the
children
of
israel
and
many
other
of
god
s
children
have
continued
to
groan
under
the
rod
of
the
oppressor
on
the
other
hand
during
the
first
few
decades
of
the
bahá
í
era
the
light
of
truth
has
illumined
the
east
and
the
west
the
gospel
of
the
fatherhood
of
god
and
the
brotherhood
of
man
has
been
carried
into
all
countries
of
the
world
the
great
military
autocracies
have
been
overthrown
and
a
consciousness
of
world
unity
has
been
born
which
brings
hope
of
eventual
relief
to
all
the
downtrodden
and
oppressed
nationalities
of
the
world
the
great
war
which
from
to
convulsed
the
world
with
its
unprecedented
use
of
firearms
liquid
fire
incendiary
bombs
and
fuel
for
engines
has
indeed
been
with
burning
and
fuel
of
bahá
u
lláh
by
dealing
at
great
length
in
his
writings
with
questions
of
government
and
administration
and
showing
how
they
may
best
be
solved
has
taken
the
government
upon
his
shoulders
in
a
way
that
christ
never
did
with
regard
to
the
titles
everlasting
father
prince
of
peace
bahá
u
lláh
repeatedly
refers
to
himself
as
the
manifestation
of
the
father
of
whom
christ
and
isaiah
spoke
whereas
christ
always
referred
to
himself
as
the
son
and
bahá
u
lláh
declares
that
his
mission
is
to
establish
peace
on
earth
while
christ
said
i
came
not
to
send
peace
but
a
sword
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
during
the
whole
of
the
christian
era
wars
and
sectarian
strifes
have
abounded
the
glory
of
god
the
title
bahá
u
lláh
is
the
arabic
for
glory
of
god
and
this
very
title
is
frequently
used
by
the
hebrew
prophets
for
the
promised
one
who
is
to
appear
in
the
last
days
thus
in
the
chapter
of
isaiah
we
read
comfort
ye
comfort
ye
my
people
saith
your
god
speak
ye
comfortably
to
jerusalem
and
cry
unto
her
that
her
warfare
is
accomplished
that
her
iniquity
is
pardoned
for
she
hath
received
of
the
lord
s
hand
double
for
all
her
sins
the
voice
of
him
that
crieth
in
the
wilderness
prepare
ye
the
way
of
the
lord
make
straight
in
the
desert
a
highway
for
our
god
every
valley
shall
be
exalted
and
every
mountain
and
hill
shall
be
made
low
and
the
crooked
shall
be
made
straight
and
the
rough
places
plain
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
shall
be
revealed
and
all
flesh
shall
see
it
together
isa
xl
like
the
former
prophecy
this
has
also
been
partly
fulfilled
in
the
advent
of
christ
and
his
forerunner
john
the
baptist
but
only
partly
for
in
the
days
of
christ
the
warfare
of
jerusalem
was
not
accomplished
many
centuries
of
bitter
trail
and
humiliation
were
yet
in
store
for
her
with
the
advent
of
the
báb
and
bahá
u
lláh
however
the
more
complete
fulfillment
dawned
for
jerusalem
and
her
prospects
of
a
peaceful
and
glorious
future
seem
now
to
be
reasonably
assured
other
prophecies
speak
of
the
redeemer
of
israel
the
glory
of
the
lord
as
coming
to
the
holy
land
from
the
east
from
the
rising
of
the
sun
now
bahá
u
lláh
appeared
in
persia
which
is
eastward
from
palestine
towards
the
rising
of
the
sun
and
he
came
to
the
holy
land
where
he
spent
the
last
years
of
his
life
had
he
come
there
as
a
free
man
people
might
have
said
that
it
was
the
trick
of
an
impostor
in
order
to
conform
to
the
prophecies
but
he
came
as
an
exile
and
prisoner
he
was
sent
there
by
the
of
persia
and
the
sulṭán
of
turkey
who
can
hardly
be
suspected
of
any
design
to
furnish
arguments
in
favor
of
bahá
u
lláh
s
claim
to
be
the
glory
of
god
whose
coming
the
prophets
foretold
the
branch
in
the
prophecies
of
isaiah
jeremiah
ezekiel
and
zechariah
are
several
references
to
a
man
called
the
branch
these
have
often
been
taken
by
christians
as
applying
to
christ
but
are
regarded
by
bahá
ís
as
referring
especially
to
bahá
u
lláh
the
longest
bible
prophecy
about
the
branch
is
in
the
chapter
of
isaiah
and
there
shall
come
forth
a
rod
out
of
the
stem
of
jesse
and
a
branch
shall
grow
out
of
his
roots
and
the
spirit
of
the
lord
shall
rest
upon
him
the
spirit
of
wisdom
and
understanding
the
spirit
of
counsel
and
might
the
spirit
of
knowledge
and
of
the
fear
of
the
lord
righteousness
shall
be
the
girdle
of
his
loins
and
faithfulness
the
girdle
of
his
reins
the
wolf
also
shall
dwell
with
the
lamb
and
the
leopard
with
the
kid
and
the
calf
and
the
young
lion
and
the
fatling
together
and
a
little
child
shall
lead
them
they
shall
not
hurt
nor
destroy
in
all
my
holy
mountain
for
the
earth
shall
be
full
of
the
knowledge
of
the
lord
as
the
waters
cover
the
sea
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
the
lord
shall
set
his
hand
again
the
second
time
to
recover
the
remnant
of
his
people
which
shall
be
left
from
assyria
and
from
egypt
and
from
pathros
and
from
cush
and
from
elam
and
from
shinar
and
from
hamath
and
from
the
islands
of
the
sea
and
he
shall
set
up
an
ensign
for
the
nations
and
shall
assemble
the
outcasts
of
israel
and
gather
together
the
dispersed
of
judah
from
the
four
corners
of
the
xi
abdu
remarks
about
this
and
other
prophecies
of
the
branch
one
of
the
great
events
which
is
to
occur
in
the
day
of
the
manifestation
of
that
incomparable
branch
is
the
hoisting
of
the
standard
of
god
among
all
nations
meaning
that
all
the
nations
and
tribes
will
come
under
the
shadow
of
this
divine
banner
which
is
no
other
than
the
lordly
branch
itself
and
will
become
a
single
nation
the
antagonism
of
faiths
and
religions
the
hostility
of
races
and
peoples
and
the
national
differences
will
be
eradicated
from
amongst
them
all
will
become
one
religion
one
faith
one
race
and
one
single
people
and
will
dwell
in
one
native
land
which
is
the
terrestrial
globe
universal
peace
and
concord
will
be
realised
between
all
the
nations
and
that
incomparable
branch
will
gather
together
all
israel
signifying
that
in
this
cycle
israel
will
be
gathered
in
the
holy
land
and
that
the
jewish
people
who
are
scattered
to
the
east
and
west
south
and
north
will
be
assembled
together
now
see
these
events
did
not
take
place
in
the
christian
cycle
for
the
nations
did
not
come
under
the
one
standard
which
is
the
divine
branch
but
in
this
cycle
of
the
lord
of
hosts
all
the
nations
and
people
will
enter
under
the
shadow
of
this
flag
in
the
same
way
israel
scattered
all
over
the
world
was
not
reassembled
in
the
holy
land
in
the
christian
cycle
but
in
the
beginning
of
the
cycle
of
bahá
u
lláh
this
divine
promise
as
is
clearly
stated
in
all
the
books
of
the
prophets
has
begun
to
be
manifest
you
can
see
that
form
all
the
parts
of
the
world
tribes
of
jews
are
coming
to
the
holy
land
they
live
in
villages
and
lands
which
they
make
their
own
and
day
by
day
they
are
increasing
to
such
an
extent
that
all
palestine
will
become
their
answered
questions
the
day
of
god
the
word
day
in
such
phrases
as
day
of
god
and
last
day
is
interpreted
as
meaning
each
of
the
great
has
his
each
is
like
a
sun
his
teachings
have
their
dawn
their
truth
gradually
illumines
more
and
more
the
minds
and
hearts
of
the
people
until
they
attain
the
zenith
of
their
influence
then
they
gradually
become
obscured
misrepresented
and
corrupted
and
darkness
overshadows
the
earth
until
the
sun
of
a
new
day
arises
the
day
of
the
supreme
manifestation
of
god
is
the
last
day
because
it
is
a
day
that
shall
never
end
and
shall
not
be
overtaken
by
night
his
sun
shall
never
set
but
shall
illumine
the
souls
of
men
both
in
this
world
and
in
the
world
to
come
in
reality
none
of
the
spiritual
suns
ever
set
the
suns
of
moses
of
christ
of
muḥammad
and
all
the
other
prophets
are
still
shining
in
heaven
with
undiminished
luster
but
earthborn
clouds
have
concealed
their
radiance
from
the
people
of
earth
the
supreme
sun
of
bahá
u
lláh
will
finally
disperse
these
dark
clouds
so
that
the
people
of
all
religions
will
rejoice
in
the
light
of
all
the
prophets
and
with
one
accord
worship
the
one
god
whose
light
all
the
prophets
have
mirrored
forth
the
day
of
judgment
christ
spoke
much
in
parables
about
a
great
day
of
judgment
when
the
son
of
man
shall
come
in
the
glory
of
his
father
and
shall
reward
every
man
according
to
his
works
matt
xvi
he
compares
this
day
to
the
time
of
harvest
when
the
tares
are
burned
and
the
wheat
gathered
into
barns
so
shall
it
be
in
the
end
of
this
world
consummation
of
the
age
the
son
of
man
shall
send
forth
his
angels
and
they
shall
gather
out
of
his
kingdom
all
things
that
offend
and
them
which
do
iniquity
and
shall
cast
them
into
a
furnace
of
fire
there
shall
be
wailing
and
gnashing
of
teeth
then
shall
the
righteous
shine
forth
as
the
sun
in
the
kingdom
of
their
xiii
the
phrase
end
of
the
world
used
in
the
authorized
version
of
the
bible
in
this
and
similar
passages
has
led
many
to
suppose
that
when
the
day
of
judgment
comes
the
earth
will
suddenly
be
destroyed
but
this
is
evidently
a
mistake
the
true
translation
of
the
phrase
appears
to
be
the
consummation
or
end
of
the
christ
teaches
that
the
kingdom
of
the
father
is
to
be
established
on
earth
as
well
as
in
heaven
he
teaches
us
to
pray
thy
kingdom
come
thy
will
be
done
on
earth
as
it
is
in
in
the
parable
of
the
vineyard
when
the
father
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
comes
to
destroy
the
wicked
husbandmen
he
does
not
destroy
the
vineyard
the
world
also
but
lets
it
out
to
other
husbandmen
who
will
render
him
the
fruits
in
their
season
the
earth
is
not
to
be
destroyed
but
to
be
renewed
and
regenerated
christ
speaks
of
that
day
on
another
occasion
as
the
regeneration
when
the
son
of
man
shall
sit
in
the
throne
of
his
peter
speaks
of
it
as
the
times
of
refreshing
the
times
of
restitution
of
all
things
which
god
hath
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
all
his
holy
prophets
since
the
world
the
day
of
judgment
of
which
christ
speaks
is
evidently
identical
with
the
coming
of
the
lord
of
hosts
the
father
which
was
prophesied
by
isaiah
and
the
other
old
testament
prophets
a
time
of
terrible
punishment
for
the
wicked
but
a
time
in
which
justice
shall
be
established
and
righteousness
rule
on
earth
as
in
heaven
in
the
bahá
í
interpretation
the
coming
of
each
manifestation
of
god
is
a
day
of
judgment
but
the
coming
of
the
supreme
manifestation
of
bahá
u
lláh
is
the
great
day
of
judgment
for
the
world
cycle
in
which
we
are
living
the
trumpet
blast
of
which
christ
and
muḥammad
and
many
other
prophets
speak
is
the
call
of
the
manifestation
which
is
sounded
for
all
who
are
in
heaven
and
on
embodied
and
the
disembodied
the
meeting
with
god
through
his
manifestation
is
for
those
who
desire
to
meet
him
the
gateway
to
the
paradise
of
knowing
and
loving
him
and
living
in
love
with
all
his
creatures
those
on
the
other
hand
who
prefer
their
own
way
to
god
s
way
as
revealed
by
the
manifestation
thereby
consign
themselves
to
the
hell
of
selfishness
error
and
enmity
the
great
resurrection
the
day
of
judgment
is
also
the
day
of
resurrection
of
the
raising
of
the
dead
paul
in
his
first
epistle
to
the
corinthians
says
behold
i
shew
you
a
mystery
we
shall
not
all
sleep
but
we
shall
all
be
changed
in
a
moment
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
at
the
last
trump
for
the
trumpet
shall
sound
and
the
dead
shall
be
raised
incorruptible
and
we
shall
be
changed
for
this
corruptible
must
put
on
incorruption
and
this
mortal
must
put
on
cor
xv
as
to
the
meaning
of
these
passages
about
the
raising
of
the
dead
bahá
u
lláh
writes
in
the
book
of
íqán
by
the
terms
life
and
death
spoken
of
in
the
scriptures
is
intended
the
life
of
faith
and
the
death
of
unbelief
the
generality
of
the
people
owing
to
their
failure
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
these
words
rejected
and
despised
the
person
of
the
manifestation
deprived
themselves
of
the
light
of
his
divine
guidance
and
refused
to
follow
the
example
of
that
immortal
beauty
even
as
jesus
said
ye
must
be
born
again
john
iii
again
he
saith
except
a
man
be
born
of
water
and
of
the
spirit
he
can
not
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
that
which
is
born
of
the
flesh
is
flesh
and
that
which
is
born
of
the
spirit
is
spirit
john
iii
the
purpose
of
these
words
is
that
whosoever
in
every
dispensation
is
born
of
the
spirit
and
is
quickened
by
the
breath
of
the
manifestation
of
holiness
he
verily
is
of
those
that
have
attained
unto
life
and
resurrection
and
have
entered
into
the
paradise
of
the
love
of
god
and
whosoever
is
not
of
them
is
condemned
to
death
and
deprivation
to
the
fire
of
unbelief
and
to
the
wrath
of
god
in
every
age
and
century
the
purpose
of
the
prophets
of
god
and
their
chosen
ones
hath
been
no
other
but
to
affirm
the
spiritual
significance
of
the
terms
life
resurrection
and
wert
thou
to
attain
to
but
a
dewdrop
of
the
crystal
waters
of
divine
knowledge
thou
wouldst
readily
realize
that
true
life
is
not
the
life
of
the
flesh
but
the
life
of
the
spirit
for
the
life
of
the
flesh
is
common
to
both
men
and
animals
whereas
the
life
of
the
spirit
is
possessed
only
by
the
pure
in
heart
who
have
quaffed
from
the
ocean
of
faith
and
partaken
of
the
fruit
of
certitude
this
life
knoweth
no
death
and
this
existence
is
crowned
by
immortality
even
as
it
hath
been
said
he
who
is
a
true
believer
liveth
both
in
this
world
and
in
the
world
to
if
by
life
be
meant
this
earthly
life
it
is
evident
that
death
must
needs
overtake
pp
according
to
the
bahá
í
teaching
the
resurrection
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
gross
physical
body
that
body
once
dead
is
done
with
it
becomes
decomposed
and
its
atoms
will
never
be
recomposed
into
the
same
body
resurrection
is
the
birth
of
the
individual
to
spiritual
life
through
the
gift
of
the
holy
spirit
bestowed
through
the
manifestation
of
god
the
grave
from
which
he
arises
is
the
grave
of
ignorance
and
negligence
of
god
the
sleep
from
which
he
awakens
is
the
dormant
spiritual
condition
in
which
many
await
the
dawn
of
the
day
of
god
this
dawn
illumines
all
who
have
lived
on
the
face
of
the
earth
whether
they
are
in
the
body
or
out
of
the
body
but
those
who
are
spiritually
blind
can
not
perceive
it
the
day
of
resurrection
is
not
a
day
of
hours
but
an
era
which
has
now
begun
and
will
last
as
long
as
the
present
world
cycle
continues
it
will
continue
when
all
traces
of
the
present
civilization
will
have
been
wiped
off
the
surface
of
the
globe
return
of
christ
in
many
of
his
conversations
christ
speaks
of
the
future
manifestation
of
god
in
the
third
person
but
in
others
the
first
person
is
used
he
says
i
go
to
prepare
a
place
for
you
and
if
i
go
and
prepare
a
place
for
you
i
will
come
again
and
receive
you
unto
myself
john
xiv
in
the
first
chapter
of
acts
we
read
that
the
disciples
were
told
at
the
ascension
of
jesus
this
same
jesus
which
is
taken
up
from
you
into
heaven
shall
so
come
in
like
manner
as
ye
have
seen
him
go
into
because
of
these
and
similar
sayings
many
christians
expect
that
when
the
son
of
man
comes
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
and
with
great
glory
they
shall
see
in
bodily
form
the
very
jesus
who
walked
the
streets
of
jerusalem
two
thousand
years
ago
and
bled
and
suffered
on
the
cross
they
expect
to
be
able
to
thrust
their
fingers
into
the
prints
of
the
nails
on
his
hands
and
feet
and
their
hands
into
the
spear
wound
in
his
side
but
surely
a
little
reflection
on
christ
s
own
words
would
dissipate
such
an
idea
the
jews
of
christ
s
time
had
just
such
ideas
about
the
return
of
elias
but
jesus
explained
their
error
showing
that
the
prophecy
that
elias
must
first
come
was
fulfilled
not
by
the
return
of
the
person
and
body
of
the
former
elias
but
in
the
person
of
john
the
baptist
who
came
in
the
spirit
and
power
of
and
if
ye
will
receive
it
said
christ
this
is
elias
which
was
for
to
come
he
that
hath
ears
to
hear
let
him
the
return
of
elias
therefore
meant
the
appearance
of
another
person
born
of
other
parents
but
inspired
by
god
with
the
same
spirit
and
power
these
words
of
jesus
may
surely
be
taken
to
imply
that
the
return
of
christ
will
in
like
manner
be
accomplished
by
the
appearance
of
another
person
born
of
another
mother
but
showing
forth
the
spirit
and
power
of
god
even
as
christ
did
bahá
u
lláh
explains
that
the
coming
again
of
christ
was
fulfilled
in
the
advent
of
the
báb
and
in
his
own
coming
he
says
consider
the
sun
were
it
to
say
now
i
am
the
sun
of
yesterday
it
would
speak
the
truth
and
should
it
bearing
the
sequence
of
time
in
mind
claim
to
be
other
than
that
sun
it
still
would
speak
the
truth
in
like
manner
if
it
be
said
that
all
the
days
are
but
one
and
the
same
it
is
correct
and
true
and
if
it
be
said
with
respect
to
their
particular
names
and
designations
that
they
differ
that
again
is
true
for
though
they
are
the
same
yet
one
doth
recognize
in
each
a
separate
designation
a
specific
attribute
a
particular
character
conceive
accordingly
the
distinction
variation
and
unity
characteristic
of
the
various
manifestations
of
holiness
that
thou
mayest
comprehend
the
allusions
made
by
the
creator
of
all
names
and
attributes
to
the
mysteries
of
distinction
and
unity
and
discover
the
answer
to
thy
question
as
to
why
that
everlasting
beauty
should
have
at
sundry
times
called
himself
by
different
names
and
abdu
says
know
that
the
return
of
christ
for
a
second
time
doth
not
mean
what
the
people
believe
but
rather
signifieth
the
one
promised
to
come
after
him
he
shall
come
with
the
kingdom
of
god
and
his
power
which
hath
surrounded
the
world
this
dominion
is
in
the
world
of
hearts
and
spirits
and
not
in
that
of
matter
for
the
material
world
is
not
comparable
to
a
single
wing
of
a
fly
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
wert
thou
of
those
who
know
verily
christ
came
with
his
kingdom
from
the
beginning
which
hath
no
beginning
and
will
come
with
his
kingdom
to
the
eternity
of
eternities
inasmuch
as
in
this
sense
christ
is
an
expression
of
the
divine
reality
the
simple
essence
and
heavenly
entity
which
hath
no
beginning
nor
ending
it
hath
appearance
arising
manifestation
and
setting
in
each
of
the
cycles
the
time
of
the
end
christ
and
his
apostles
mentioned
many
signs
which
would
distinguish
the
times
of
the
return
of
the
son
of
man
in
the
glory
of
the
father
christ
said
and
when
ye
shall
see
jerusalem
compassed
with
armies
then
know
that
the
desolation
thereof
is
nigh
for
these
be
the
days
of
vengeance
that
all
things
which
are
written
may
be
fulfilled
for
there
shall
be
great
distress
in
the
land
and
wrath
upon
this
people
and
they
shall
fall
by
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
shall
be
led
away
captive
into
all
nations
and
jerusalem
shall
be
trodden
down
by
the
gentiles
until
the
times
of
the
gentiles
shall
be
xxi
again
he
said
take
heed
that
no
man
deceive
you
for
many
shall
come
in
my
name
saying
i
am
christ
and
shall
deceive
many
and
ye
shall
hear
of
wars
and
rumours
of
wars
see
that
ye
be
not
troubled
for
all
these
things
must
come
to
pass
but
the
end
is
not
yet
for
nation
shall
rise
against
nation
and
kingdom
against
kingdom
and
there
shall
be
famines
and
pestilences
and
earthquakes
in
divers
places
all
these
are
the
beginning
of
sorrows
then
shall
they
deliver
you
up
to
be
afflicted
and
shall
kill
you
and
ye
shall
be
hated
of
all
nations
for
my
name
s
sake
and
then
shall
many
be
offended
and
shall
betray
one
another
and
shall
hate
one
another
and
many
false
prophets
shall
rise
and
shall
deceive
many
and
because
iniquity
shall
abound
the
love
of
many
shall
wax
cold
but
he
that
shall
endure
unto
the
end
the
same
shall
be
saved
and
this
gospel
of
the
kingdom
shall
be
preached
in
all
the
world
for
a
witness
unto
all
nations
and
then
shall
the
end
xxiv
in
these
two
passages
christ
foretold
in
plain
terms
without
veil
or
covering
the
things
that
must
come
to
pass
before
the
coming
of
the
son
of
man
during
the
centuries
that
have
elapsed
since
christ
spoke
every
one
of
these
signs
has
been
fulfilled
in
the
last
part
of
each
passage
he
mentions
an
event
that
shall
mark
the
time
of
the
one
case
the
ending
of
the
jewish
exile
and
the
restoration
of
jerusalem
and
in
the
other
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
in
all
the
world
it
is
startling
to
find
that
both
of
these
signs
are
being
literally
fulfilled
in
our
own
times
if
these
parts
of
the
prophecy
are
as
true
as
the
rest
it
follows
that
we
must
be
living
now
in
the
time
of
the
end
of
which
christ
spoke
muḥammad
also
mentions
certain
signs
which
will
persist
until
the
day
of
resurrection
in
the
qur
án
we
read
when
alláh
said
o
jesus
verily
i
will
cause
thee
to
die
and
exalt
thee
towards
me
and
clear
thee
of
the
charges
of
those
who
disbelieve
and
will
place
those
who
follow
thee
that
is
christians
above
those
who
disbelieve
jews
and
others
until
the
day
of
resurrection
then
to
me
shall
be
your
return
so
i
will
decide
between
you
concerning
that
in
which
you
iii
the
hand
of
god
say
the
jews
is
chained
their
own
hands
shall
be
chained
for
that
which
they
have
said
shall
they
be
cursed
nay
outstretched
are
both
his
hands
at
his
own
pleasure
doth
he
bestow
gifts
that
which
hath
been
sent
down
to
thee
from
thy
lord
will
surely
increase
the
rebellion
and
unbelief
of
many
of
them
and
we
have
put
enmity
and
hatred
between
them
that
shall
last
until
the
day
of
resurrection
oft
as
they
kindle
a
beacon
fire
for
war
shall
god
quench
v
and
of
those
who
say
we
are
christians
have
we
accepted
the
covenant
but
they
too
have
forgotten
a
part
of
what
they
were
taught
wherefore
we
have
stirred
up
enmity
and
hatred
among
them
that
shall
last
till
the
day
of
resurrection
and
in
the
end
will
god
tell
them
of
their
v
these
words
also
have
been
literally
fulfilled
in
the
subjection
of
the
jews
to
christian
and
muslim
peoples
and
in
the
sectarianism
and
strife
which
have
divided
both
jews
and
christians
among
themselves
during
all
the
centuries
since
muḥammad
spoke
only
since
the
commencement
of
the
bahá
í
era
the
day
of
resurrection
have
signs
of
the
approaching
end
of
these
conditions
made
their
appearance
signs
in
heaven
and
earth
in
the
hebrew
christian
muḥammadan
and
many
other
scriptures
there
is
a
remarkable
similarity
in
the
description
of
the
signs
which
are
to
accompany
the
coming
of
the
promised
one
in
the
book
of
joel
we
read
and
i
will
shew
wonders
in
the
heavens
and
in
the
earth
blood
and
fire
and
pillars
of
smoke
the
sun
shall
be
turned
into
darkness
and
the
moon
into
blood
before
the
great
and
terrible
days
of
the
lord
come
for
behold
in
those
days
when
i
shall
bring
again
the
captivity
of
judah
and
jerusalem
i
will
also
gather
all
nations
and
will
bring
them
down
into
the
valley
of
jehoshaphat
jehovah
judgeth
and
will
plead
with
them
there

the
valley
of

the
day

near
in
the
valley
of
decision

sun
and
the
moon
shall
be
darkened
and
the

withdraw
their
shining
the
lord
also
shall
roar
out
of
zion
and
utter
his

says
immediately
after
the
tribulation
of
those
days
shall
the
sun
be
darkened
and
the
moon
shall
not
give
her
light
and
the
stars
shall
fall
from
heaven
and
the
powers
of
the
heavens
shall
be
shaken
and
then
shall
appear
the
sign
of
the
son
of
man
in
heaven
and
then
shall
all
the
tribes
of
the
earth
mourn
and
they
shall
see
the
son
of

xxiv
in
the
qur
án
we
read
when
the
sun
shall
be
shrouded
and
when
the
stars
shall
fall
and
when
the
mountains
are
made
to
pass
away
and
when
the
leaves
of
the
book
shall
be
unrolled
and
when
the
heaven
shall
be
uncovered
and
when
hell
shall
be
made
to
lxxxi
in
the
book
of
íqán
bahá
u
lláh
explains
that
these
prophecies
about
the
sun
moon
and
stars
the
heavens
and
the
earth
are
symbolical
and
are
not
to
be
understood
merely
in
the
literal
sense
the
prophets
were
primarily
concerned
with
spiritual
not
material
things
with
spiritual
not
with
physical
light
when
they
mention
the
sun
in
connection
with
the
day
of
judgment
they
refer
to
the
sun
of
righteousness
the
sun
is
the
supreme
source
of
light
so
moses
was
a
sun
for
the
hebrews
christ
for
the
christians
and
muḥammad
for
the
muslims
when
the
prophets
speak
of
the
sun
being
darkened
what
is
meant
is
that
the
pure
teachings
of
these
spiritual
suns
have
become
obscured
by
misrepresentation
misunderstanding
and
prejudice
so
that
the
people
are
in
spiritual
darkness
the
moon
and
stars
are
the
lesser
sources
of
illumination
the
religious
leaders
and
teachers
who
should
guide
and
inspire
the
people
when
it
is
said
that
the
moon
shall
not
give
her
light
or
shall
be
turned
into
blood
and
the
stars
shall
fall
from
heaven
it
is
indicated
that
the
leaders
of
the
churches
shall
become
debased
engaging
in
strife
and
contention
and
the
priests
shall
become
worldly
minded
concerned
about
earthly
instead
of
heavenly
things
the
meaning
of
these
prophecies
is
not
exhausted
by
one
explanation
however
and
there
are
other
senses
in
which
these
symbols
can
be
interpreted
bahá
u
lláh
says
that
in
another
sense
the
words
sun
moon
and
stars
are
applied
to
the
ordinances
and
instructions
enacted
in
every
religion
as
in
every
subsequent
manifestation
the
ceremonies
forms
customs
and
instructions
of
the
preceding
manifestations
are
changed
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
the
times
so
in
this
sense
the
sun
and
moon
are
changed
and
the
stars
dispersed
in
many
cases
the
literal
fulfillment
of
these
prophecies
in
the
outward
sense
would
be
absurd
or
impossible
for
example
the
moon
being
turned
into
blood
or
the
stars
falling
upon
the
earth
the
least
of
the
visible
stars
is
many
thousand
times
larger
than
the
earth
and
were
one
to
fall
on
the
earth
there
would
be
no
earth
left
for
another
to
fall
on
in
other
cases
however
there
is
a
material
as
well
as
a
spiritual
fulfillment
for
example
the
holy
land
did
literally
become
desert
and
desolate
during
many
centuries
as
foretold
by
the
prophets
but
already
in
the
day
of
resurrection
it
is
beginning
to
rejoice
and
blossom
as
the
rose
as
isaiah
foretold
prosperous
colonies
are
being
started
the
land
is
being
irrigated
and
cultivated
and
vineyards
olive
groves
and
gardens
are
flourishing
where
half
a
century
ago
there
was
only
sandy
waste
doubtless
when
men
beat
their
swords
into
ploughshares
and
their
spears
into
pruning
hooks
wildernesses
and
deserts
in
all
parts
of
the
world
will
be
reclaimed
the
scorching
winds
and
sandstorms
that
blow
from
these
deserts
and
make
life
in
their
neighborhood
intolerable
will
be
things
of
the
past
the
climate
of
the
whole
earth
will
become
milder
and
more
equable
cities
will
no
longer
defile
the
air
with
smoke
and
poisonous
fumes
and
even
in
the
outward
material
sense
there
will
be
new
heavens
and
a
new
manner
of
coming
as
to
the
manner
of
his
coming
at
the
end
of
the
age
christ
said
and
they
shall
see
the
son
of
man
coming
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
with
power
and
great
glory
and
he
shall
send
his
angels
with
a
great
sound
of
a
trumpet
then
shall
he
sit
upon
the
throne
of
his
glory
and
before
him
shall
be
gathered
all
nations
and
he
shall
separate
them
one
from
another
as
a
shepherd
divideth
his
sheep
from
the
xxiv
xxv
regarding
these
and
similar
passages
bahá
u
lláh
writes
in
the
book
of
íqán
the
term
heaven
denoteth
loftiness
and
exaltation
inasmuch
as
it
is
the
seat
of
the
revelation
of
those
manifestations
of
holiness
the
of
ancient
glory
these
ancient
beings
though
delivered
from
the
womb
of
their
mother
have
in
reality
descended
from
the
heaven
of
the
will
of
god
though
they
be
dwelling
on
this
earth
yet
their
true
habitations
are
the
retreats
of
glory
in
the
realms
above
whilst
walking
amongst
mortals
they
soar
in
the
heaven
of
the
divine
presence
without
feet
they
tread
the
path
of
the
spirit
and
without
wings
they
rise
unto
the
exalted
heights
of
divine
unity
with
every
fleeting
breath
they
cover
the
immensity
of
space
and
at
every
moment
traverse
the
kingdoms
of
the
visible
and
the
invisible
by
the
term
clouds
is
meant
those
things
that
are
contrary
to
the
ways
and
desires
of
men
even
as
he
hath
revealed
in
the
verse
already
quoted
as
oft
as
an
apostle
cometh
unto
you
with
that
which
your
souls
desire
not
ye
swell
with
pride
accusing
some
of
being
impostors
and
slaying
qur
án
these
clouds
signify
in
one
sense
the
annulment
of
laws
the
abrogation
of
former
dispensations
the
repeal
of
rituals
and
customs
current
amongst
men
the
exalting
of
the
illiterate
faithful
above
the
learned
opposers
of
the
faith
in
another
sense
they
mean
the
appearance
of
that
immortal
beauty
in
the
image
of
mortal
man
with
such
human
limitations
as
eating
and
drinking
poverty
and
riches
glory
and
abasement
sleeping
and
waking
and
such
other
things
as
cast
doubt
in
the
minds
of
men
and
cause
them
to
turn
away
all
such
veils
are
symbolically
referred
to
as
these
are
the
clouds
that
cause
the
heavens
of
the
knowledge
and
understanding
of
all
that
dwell
on
earth
to
be
cloven
asunder
even
as
he
hath
revealed
on
that
day
shall
the
heaven
be
cloven
by
the
qur
án
even
as
the
clouds
prevent
the
eyes
of
men
from
beholding
the
sun
so
do
these
things
hinder
the
souls
of
men
from
recognizing
the
light
of
the
divine
luminary
to
this
beareth
witness
that
which
hath
proceeded
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
unbelievers
as
revealed
in
the
sacred
book
and
they
have
said
what
manner
of
apostle
is
this
he
eateth
food
and
walketh
the
streets
unless
an
angel
be
sent
down
and
take
part
in
his
warnings
we
will
not
qur
án
other
prophets
similarly
have
been
subject
to
poverty
and
afflictions
to
hunger
and
to
the
ills
and
chances
of
this
world
as
these
holy
persons
were
subject
to
such
needs
and
wants
the
people
were
consequently
lost
in
the
wilds
of
misgivings
and
doubts
and
were
afflicted
with
bewilderment
and
perplexity
how
they
wondered
could
such
a
person
be
sent
down
from
god
assert
his
ascendancy
over
all
the
peoples
and
kindreds
of
the
earth
and
claim
himself
to
be
the
goal
of
all
creation
as
he
hath
said
but
for
thee
i
would
have
not
created
all
that
are
in
heaven
and
on
earth
yet
be
subject
to
such
trivial
things
you
must
undoubtedly
have
been
informed
of
the
tribulations
the
poverty
the
ills
and
the
degradation
that
have
befallen
every
prophet
of
god
and
his
companions
you
must
have
heard
how
the
heads
of
their
followers
were
sent
as
presents
unto
different
cities
how
grievously
they
were
hindered
from
that
whereunto
they
were
commanded
each
and
every
one
of
them
fell
a
prey
to
the
hands
of
the
enemies
of
his
cause
and
had
to
suffer
whatsoever
they
decreed
the
hath
decreed
these
very
things
that
are
contrary
to
the
desires
of
wicked
men
to
be
the
touchstone
and
standard
whereby
he
proveth
his
servants
that
the
just
may
be
known
from
the
wicked
and
the
faithful
distinguished
from
the
infidel
and
now
concerning
his
words
and
he
shall
send
his
angels
by
angels
is
meant
those
who
reinforced
by
the
power
of
the
spirit
have
consumed
with
the
fire
of
the
love
of
god
all
human
traits
and
limitations
and
have
clothed
themselves
with
the
attributes
of
the
most
exalted
beings
and
of
the
cherubim
as
the
adherents
of
jesus
have
never
understood
the
hidden
meaning
of
these
words
and
as
the
signs
which
they
and
leaders
of
their
faith
have
expected
have
failed
to
appear
they
therefore
refused
to
acknowledge
even
until
now
the
truth
of
those
manifestations
of
holiness
that
have
since
the
days
of
jesus
been
made
manifest
they
have
thus
deprived
themselves
of
the
outpourings
of
god
s
holy
grace
and
of
the
wonders
of
his
divine
utterance
such
is
their
low
estate
in
this
the
day
of
resurrection
they
have
even
failed
to
perceive
that
were
the
signs
of
the
manifestation
of
god
in
every
age
to
appear
in
the
visible
realm
in
accordance
with
the
text
of
established
traditions
none
could
possibly
deny
or
turn
away
not
would
the
blessed
be
distinguished
from
the
miserable
and
the
transgressor
from
the
judge
fairly
were
the
prophecies
recorded
in
the
gospel
to
be
literally
fulfilled
were
jesus
son
of
mary
accompanied
by
angels
to
descend
from
the
visible
heaven
upon
the
clouds
who
would
dare
to
disbelieve
who
would
dare
to
reject
the
truth
and
wax
disdainful
nay
such
consternation
would
immediately
seize
all
the
dwellers
of
the
earth
that
no
soul
would
feel
able
to
utter
a
word
much
less
to
reject
or
accept
the
pp
according
to
the
above
explanation
the
coming
of
the
son
of
man
in
lowly
human
form
born
of
woman
poor
uneducated
oppressed
and
set
at
naught
by
the
great
ones
of
the
manner
of
coming
is
the
very
touchstone
by
which
he
judges
the
people
of
earth
and
separates
them
one
from
another
as
a
shepherd
divides
his
sheep
from
the
goats
those
whose
spiritual
eyes
are
opened
can
see
through
those
clouds
and
rejoice
in
the
power
and
great
glory
very
glory
of
he
comes
to
reveal
the
others
whose
eyes
are
still
holden
by
prejudice
and
error
can
see
but
the
dark
clouds
and
continue
to
grope
in
gloom
deprived
of
the
blessed
sunshine
behold
i
will
send
my
messenger
and
he
shall
prepare
the
way
before
me
and
the
lord
whom
ye
seek
shall
suddenly
come
to
his
temple
even
the
messenger
of
the
covenant
whom
ye
delight
in
but
who
may
abide
the
day
of
his
coming
and
who
shall
stand
when
he
appeareth
for
he
is
like
a
refiner
s
fire
and
like
fullers
sope
for
behold
the
day
cometh
that
shall
burn
as
an
oven
and
all
the
proud
yea
and
all
that
do
wickedly
shall
be
stubble
but
unto
you
that
fear
my
name
shall
the
sun
of
righteousness
arise
with
healing

iii
iv
subject
of
fulfillment
of
prophecy
is
such
an
extensive
one
that
many
volumes
would
be
required
for
its
adequate
exposition
all
that
can
be
done
within
the
limits
of
a
single
chapter
is
to
indicate
the
main
outlines
of
the
bahá

interpretations
the
detailed
apocalypses
revealed
by
daniel
and
john
have
been
left
untouched
readers
will
find
certain
chapters
of
these
dealt
with
in
some
answered
questions
in

book
of

abdu
and
if
thou
say
in
thine
heart
how
shall
we
know
the
word
which
the
lord
hath
not
spoken
when
a
prophet
speaketh
in
the
name
of
the
lord
if
the
thing
follow
not
nor
come
to
pass
that
is
the
thing
which
the
lord
hath
not
spoken
but
the
prophet
hath
spoken
it
presumptuously
thou
shalt
not
be
afraid
of
xviii
creative
power
of
god
s
word
god
and
god
alone
has
the
power
to
do
whatever
he
wills
and
the
greatest
proof
of
a
manifestation
of
god
is
the
creative
power
of
his
effectiveness
to
change
and
transform
all
human
affairs
and
to
triumph
over
all
human
opposition
through
the
word
of
the
prophets
god
announces
his
will
and
the
immediate
or
subsequent
fulfillment
of
that
word
is
the
clearest
proof
of
the
prophet
s
claim
and
of
the
genuineness
of
his
inspiration
for
as
the
rain
cometh
down
and
the
snow
from
the
heaven
and
returneth
not
thither
but
watereth
the
earth
and
maketh
it
bring
forth
and
bud
that
it
may
give
seed
to
the
sower
and
bread
to
the
eater
so
shall
my
word
be
that
goeth
forth
out
of
my
mouth
it
shall
not
return
unto
me
void
but
it
shall
accomplish
that
which
i
please
and
it
shall
prosper
in
the
thing
whereto
i
sent
lv
when
the
disciples
of
john
the
baptist
came
to
jesus
with
the
question
art
thou
he
that
should
come
or
do
we
look
for
another
the
answer
of
jesus
was
simply
to
point
to
the
effects
wrought
by
his
words
go
and
shew
john
again
those
things
which
ye
do
hear
and
see
the
blind
receive
their
sight
and
the
lame
walk
the
lepers
are
cleansed
and
the
deaf
hear
the
dead
are
raised
up
and
the
poor
have
the
gospel
preached
to
them
and
blessed
is
he
whosoever
shall
not
be
offended
in
xi
let
us
now
see
what
evidence
there
is
to
show
whether
the
words
of
bahá
u
lláh
have
this
creative
power
which
is
distinctive
of
the
word
of
god
bahá
u
lláh
commanded
the
rulers
to
establish
universal
peace
and
their
prolongation
of
the
policy
of
war
since
has
overthrown
many
ancient
dynasties
while
each
successive
war
has
produced
less
and
less
fruits
of
victory
until
the
european
war
of
revealed
the
historically
startling
fact
that
was
has
become
disastrous
to
victor
and
vanquished
alike
bahá
u
lláh
bade
the
rulers
likewise
to
act
as
trustees
of
those
under
their
control
making
political
authority
a
means
to
true
general
welfare
the
progress
toward
social
legislation
has
been
unprecedented
he
commanded
limitation
of
the
extremes
of
wealth
and
poverty
and
ever
since
legislation
for
the
establishment
of
minimum
subsistence
levels
and
for
graduated
taxation
of
wealth
by
income
and
inheritance
taxes
has
been
a
constant
concern
he
commanded
the
abolition
of
both
chattel
and
economic
slavery
and
ever
since
the
progress
toward
emancipation
has
been
a
ferment
in
all
parts
of
the
world
bahá
u
lláh
declared
the
equality
of
men
and
women
expressed
through
equal
responsibilities
and
equal
rights
and
privileges
and
since
that
declaration
the
bonds
by
which
women
have
been
bound
for
ages
have
been
breaking
and
woman
has
rapidly
been
securing
her
rightful
place
as
the
equal
and
partner
of
man
he
declared
the
fundamental
oneness
of
religions
and
the
succeeding
interval
has
witnessed
the
most
determined
efforts
of
sincere
souls
in
all
parts
of
the
world
to
achieve
a
new
degree
of
tolerance
of
mutual
understanding
and
of
cooperation
for
universal
ends
the
sectarian
attitude
has
everywhere
been
undermined
and
its
historical
position
has
become
more
and
more
untenable
the
basis
of
exclusiveness
in
religion
has
been
destroyed
by
the
same
forces
making
nationalism
of
the
type
incapable
of
survival
he
commanded
universal
education
and
made
the
independent
investigation
of
truth
a
proof
of
spiritual
vitality
modern
civilization
has
been
stirred
to
its
depths
by
this
new
leaven
compulsory
education
for
children
and
the
extension
of
educational
facilities
for
adults
have
become
a
primary
policy
of
government
nations
which
deliberately
seek
to
restrict
that
very
policy
have
aroused
revolution
within
and
suspicion
and
fear
outside
their
boundaries
bahá
u
lláh
commanded
the
adoption
of
a
universal
auxiliary
language
and
zamenhof
and
others
obeyed
his
call
by
devoting
their
lives
and
genius
to
this
great
task
and
opportunity
above
all
bahá
u
lláh
imbued
humanity
with
a
new
spirit
arousing
new
longings
in
minds
and
hearts
and
new
ideals
for
society
nothing
in
all
history
is
so
dramatic
and
impressive
as
the
course
of
events
since
the
dawn
of
the
bahá
í
era
in
year
by
year
the
power
of
a
dead
past
prolonged
through
outworn
ideas
habits
attitudes
and
institutions
has
weakened
until
at
present
every
intelligent
man
and
woman
on
earth
realizes
that
humanity
is
passing
through
its
most
terrible
crisis
on
the
one
hand
we
see
the
new
creation
arising
as
the
light
of
bahá
u
lláh
s
teaching
has
revealed
the
true
path
of
evolution
on
the
other
hand
we
see
naught
but
disaster
and
frustration
in
all
realms
where
that
light
is
resisted
or
ignored
yet
to
the
faithful
bahá
í
these
and
countless
other
evidences
impressive
as
they
are
fail
to
give
the
real
measure
of
the
spiritual
majesty
of
bahá
u
lláh
his
life
on
earth
and
the
irresistible
force
of
his
inspired
words
stand
as
the
only
true
criterion
of
the
will
of
god
a
study
of
the
more
detailed
prophecies
of
bahá
u
lláh
and
their
fulfillment
will
give
powerful
corroborative
evidence
of
these
prophecies
we
shall
now
proceed
to
give
a
few
examples
about
the
authenticity
of
which
there
can
be
no
dispute
they
were
widely
published
and
known
before
their
fulfillment
came
about
the
letter
which
he
sent
to
the
crowned
heads
of
the
world
in
which
many
of
these
prophecies
occur
were
compiled
in
a
book
which
was
first
published
in
bombay
in
the
late
nineteenth
century
several
editions
have
since
been
published
we
shall
also
give
some
examples
of
noteworthy
prophecies
by
abdu
napoleon
iii
in
the
year
bahá
u
lláh
wrote
to
napoleon
iii
rebuking
him
for
his
lust
of
war
and
for
the
contempt
with
which
he
had
treated
a
former
letter
from
bahá
u
lláh
the
epistle
contains
the
following
stern
warning
for
what
thou
has
done
thy
kingdom
shall
be
thrown
into
confusion
and
thine
empire
shall
pass
from
thine
hands
as
a
punishment
for
that
which
thou
has
wrought
then
wilt
thou
know
how
thou
has
plainly
erred
commotions
shall
seize
all
the
people
in
that
land
unless
thou
arisest
to
held
this
cause
and
followest
him
who
is
the
spirit
of
god
jesus
christ
in
this
the
straight
path
hath
thy
pomp
made
thee
proud
by
my
life
it
shall
not
endure
nay
it
shall
soon
pass
away
unless
thou
holdest
fast
by
this
firm
cord
we
see
abasement
hastening
after
thee
whilst
thou
art
of
the
heedless
needless
to
say
napoleon
who
was
then
at
the
zenith
of
his
power
paid
no
heed
to
this
warning
in
the
following
year
he
went
to
war
with
prussia
firmly
convinced
that
his
troops
could
easily
gain
berlin
but
the
tragedy
foretold
by
bahá
u
lláh
overwhelmed
him
he
was
defeated
at
saarbruck
at
weisenburg
at
metz
and
finally
in
the
crushing
catastrophe
at
sedan
he
was
then
carried
prisoner
to
prussia
and
came
to
a
miserable
end
in
england
two
years
later
germany
bahá
u
lláh
later
gave
an
equally
solemn
warning
to
the
conquerors
of
napoleon
which
also
fell
on
deaf
ears
and
received
a
terrible
fulfillment
in
the
book
of
aqdas
which
was
begun
in
adrianople
and
finished
in
the
early
years
of
bahá
u
lláh
s
imprisonment
in
akká
he
addressed
the
emperor
of
germany
as
follows
o
king
of
berlin
do
thou
remember
the
one
whose
power
transcended
thy
power
napoleon
iii
and
whose
station
excelled
thy
station
where
is
he
whither
are
gone
the
things
he
possessed
take
warning
and
be
not
of
them
that
are
fast
asleep
he
it
was
who
cast
the
tablet
of
god
behind
him
when
we
made
known
unto
him
what
the
hosts
of
tyranny
had
caused
us
to
suffer
wherefore
disgrace
assailed
him
from
all
sides
and
he
went
down
to
dust
in
great
loss
think
deeply
o
king
concerning
him
and
concerning
them
who
like
unto
thee
have
conquered
cities
and
ruled
over
men
the
brought
them
down
from
their
palaces
to
their
graves
be
warned
be
of
them
who
reflect
o
banks
of
the
rhine
we
have
seen
you
covered
with
gore
inasmuch
as
the
swords
of
retribution
were
drawn
against
you
and
you
shall
have
another
turn
and
we
hear
the
lamentations
of
berlin
though
she
be
today
in
conspicuous
during
the
period
of
german
successes
in
the
great
war
of
and
especially
during
the
last
great
german
offensive
in
the
spring
of
this
prophecy
was
extensively
quoted
by
the
opponents
of
the
bahá
í
faith
in
persia
in
order
to
discredit
bahá
u
lláh
but
when
the
forward
sweep
of
the
victorious
germans
was
suddenly
transformed
into
crushing
overwhelming
disaster
the
efforts
of
these
enemies
of
the
bahá
í
cause
recoiled
on
themselves
and
the
notoriety
which
they
had
given
to
the
prophecy
became
a
powerful
means
of
enhancing
the
reputation
of
bahá
u
lláh
persia
in
the
book
of
aqdas
written
when
the
tyrannical
náṣiri
was
at
the
height
of
his
power
bahá
u
lláh
blesses
the
city
of
ṭihrán
which
is
the
capital
of
persia
and
his
own
birthplace
and
says
of
it
let
nothing
grieve
thee
o
land
of
tá
ṭihrán
for
god
hath
chosen
thee
to
be
the
source
of
the
joy
of
all
mankind
he
shall
if
it
be
his
will
bless
thy
throne
with
one
who
will
rule
with
justice
who
will
gather
together
the
flock
of
god
which
the
wolves
have
scattered
such
a
ruler
will
with
joy
and
gladness
turn
his
face
towards
and
extend
his
favors
unto
the
people
of
bahá
he
indeed
is
accounted
in
the
sight
of
god
as
a
jewel
among
men
upon
him
rest
forever
the
glory
of
god
and
the
glory
of
all
that
dwell
in
the
kingdom
of
his
revelation
rejoice
with
great
joy
for
god
hath
made
thee
the
day
spring
of
his
light
inasmuch
as
within
thee
was
born
the
manifestation
of
his
glory
be
thou
glad
for
this
name
that
hath
been
conferred
upon
name
through
which
the
day
star
of
grace
hath
shed
its
splendor
through
which
both
earth
and
heaven
have
been
illumined
ere
long
will
the
state
of
affairs
within
thee
be
changed
and
the
reins
of
power
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
people
verily
thy
lord
is
the
his
authority
embraceth
all
things
rest
thou
assured
in
the
gracious
favor
of
thy
lord
the
eye
of
his
shall
everlastingly
be
directed
towards
thee
the
day
is
approaching
when
thy
agitation
will
have
been
transmuted
into
peace
and
quiet
calm
thus
hath
it
been
decreed
in
the
wondrous
from
the
writings
of
bahá
u
lláh
pp
so
far
persia
has
only
begun
to
emerge
from
the
period
of
confusion
foretold
by
bahá
u
lláh
but
already
constitutional
government
has
been
started
and
signs
are
not
lacking
that
a
brighter
era
is
at
hand
turkey
to
the
sulṭán
of
turkey
and
his
prime
minister
alí
bahá
u
lláh
then
in
confined
in
a
turkish
prison
addressed
some
of
his
most
solemn
grave
warnings
to
the
sulṭán
he
wrote
from
the
barracks
at
akká
o
thou
who
considerest
thyself
the
greatest
of
all
men
erelong
thy
name
shall
be
forgotten
and
thou
shalt
find
thyself
in
great
loss
according
to
thy
opinion
this
quickener
of
the
world
and
its
peacemaker
is
culpable
and
seditious
what
crime
have
the
women
children
and
suffering
babes
committed
to
merit
thy
wrath
oppression
and
hate
you
have
persecuted
a
number
of
souls
who
have
shown
no
opposition
in
your
country
and
who
have
instigated
no
revolution
against
the
government
nay
rather
by
day
and
by
night
they
have
been
peacefully
engaged
in
the
mentioning
of
god
you
have
pillaged
their
properties
and
through
your
tyrannical
acts
all
that
they
had
was
taken
from
them
before
god
a
handful
of
dust
is
greater
than
your
kingdom
glory
sovereignty
and
dominion
and
should
he
desire
he
would
scatter
you
as
the
sand
of
the
desert
erelong
his
wrath
shall
overtake
you
revolutions
shall
appear
in
your
midst
and
your
countries
will
be
divided
then
you
will
weep
and
lament
and
nowhere
will
you
find
help
and
protection
be
ye
watchful
for
the
wrath
of
god
is
prepared
and
erelong
you
shall
behold
that
which
is
written
by
the
pen
of
command
and
to
alí
he
wrote
thou
hast
o
chief
committed
that
which
hath
made
muḥammad
the
apostle
of
god
groan
in
the
most
exalted
paradise
the
world
hath
made
thee
proud
so
much
so
that
thou
hast
turned
away
from
the
face
through
whose
brightness
the
concourse
on
high
hath
been
illumined
soon
thou
shalt
find
thyself
in
evident
loss
thou
didst
unite
with
the
ruler
of
persia
for
doing
me
harm
although
i
had
come
to
you
from
the
of
the
almighty
the
great
with
a
cause
which
refreshed
the
eyes
of
the
favored
ones
of
god
didst
thou
think
that
thou
could
put
out
the
fire
which
god
hath
enkindled
in
the
universe
no
i
declare
by
his
true
soul
wert
thou
of
those
who
understand
more
than
that
by
what
thou
hast
done
its
blaze
and
flame
have
been
increased
soon
it
will
encompass
the
world
and
its
inhabitants
the
day
is
approaching
when
the
land
of
mystery
adrianople
and
what
is
beside
it
shall
be
changed
and
shall
pass
out
of
the
hands
of
the
king
and
commotions
shall
appear
and
the
voice
of
lamentation
shall
be
raised
and
the
evidences
of
mischief
shall
be
revealed
on
all
sides
and
confusion
shall
spread
by
reason
of
that
which
hath
befallen
these
captives
bahá
u
lláh
and
his
companions
at
the
hands
of
the
hosts
of
oppression
the
course
of
things
shall
be
altered
and
conditions
shall
wax
so
grievous
that
the
very
sand
on
the
desolate
hills
will
moan
and
the
trees
on
the
mountain
will
weep
and
blood
will
flow
out
of
all
things
then
wilt
thou
behold
the
people
in
sore
distress
thus
hath
the
matter
been
decreed
on
the
part
of
the
designer
the
wise
whose
command
the
hosts
of
heaven
and
earth
could
not
withstand
nor
could
all
the
kings
and
rulers
withhold
him
from
that
which
he
willeth
calamities
are
the
oil
for
this
lamp
and
through
them
its
light
increaseth
were
ye
of
those
who
know
all
oppositions
displayed
by
the
oppressors
are
indeed
as
heralds
to
this
faith
and
by
them
the
appearance
of
god
and
his
cause
have
become
widely
spread
among
the
people
of
the
world
again
in
the
book
of
aqdas
he
wrote
o
spot
constantinople
that
art
situate
on
the
shores
of
the
two
seas
the
throne
of
tyranny
hath
verily
been
established
upon
thee
and
the
flame
of
hatred
hath
been
kindled
within
thy
bosom
in
such
wise
that
the
concourse
on
high
and
they
who
circle
around
the
exalted
throne
have
wailed
and
lamented
we
behold
in
thee
the
foolish
ruling
over
the
wise
and
darkness
vaunting
itself
against
the
light
thou
art
indeed
filled
with
manifest
pride
hath
thine
outward
splendor
made
thee
vainglorious
by
him
who
is
the
lord
of
mankind
it
shall
soon
perish
and
thy
daughters
and
thy
widows
and
all
the
kindreds
that
dwell
within
thee
shall
lament
thus
informeth
thee
the
the
the
successive
calamities
which
have
befallen
this
once
great
empire
since
the
publication
of
these
warnings
have
furnished
an
eloquent
commentary
on
their
prophetic
significance
america
in
the
book
of
aqdas
revealed
in
akká
in
bahá
u
lláh
appealed
to
america
as
follows
o
rulers
of
america
and
the
presidents
of
the
republics
therein
give
ear
unto
that
which
hath
been
raised
from
the
dayspring
of
grandeur
verily
there
is
none
other
god
but
me
the
lord
of
utterance
the
bind
ye
the
broken
with
the
hands
of
justice
and
crush
the
oppressor
who
flourisheth
with
the
rod
of
the
commandments
of
your
lord
the
ordainer
the
abdu
in
his
addresses
in
america
and
elsewhere
frequently
expressed
the
hope
the
prayer
and
the
assurance
that
the
banner
of
international
peace
would
be
first
raised
in
america
at
cincinnati
ohio
on
november
he
said
america
is
a
noble
nation
a
of
peace
throughout
the
world
shedding
her
light
to
all
regions
other
nations
are
not
untrammeled
and
free
of
intrigues
like
the
united
states
and
are
unable
to
bring
about
universal
peace
but
america
thank
god
is
at
peace
with
all
the
world
and
is
worthy
of
raising
the
flag
of
brotherhood
and
international
peace
when
the
summons
to
international
peace
is
raised
by
america
all
the
rest
of
the
world
will
cry
yes
we
the
nations
of
every
clime
will
join
in
adopting
the
teachings
of
bahá
u
lláh
revealed
over
fifty
years
ago
in
his
epistles
he
asked
the
parliaments
of
the
world
to
send
their
best
and
wisest
men
to
an
international
world
parliament
that
should
decide
all
questions
between
the
peoples
and
establish
peace
then
we
shall
have
the
parliament
of
man
of
which
the
prophets
have
dreamed
the
appeals
of
bahá
u
lláh
and
abdu
have
already
been
responded
to
in
a
large
measure
by
the
united
states
of
america
and
in
no
country
of
the
world
have
the
bahá
í
teachings
met
with
readier
acceptance
the
role
assigned
to
america
of
summoning
the
nations
to
international
peace
has
as
yet
however
been
only
partially
played
and
bahá
ís
are
awaiting
with
interest
the
developments
which
the
future
has
in
store
the
great
war
both
bahá
u
lláh
and
abdu
on
many
occasions
foretold
with
surprising
accuracy
the
coming
of
the
great
war
of
at
sacramento
california
on
october
abdu
said
today
the
european
continent
is
like
an
arsenal
it
is
a
storehouse
of
explosives
ready
for
just
a
spark
and
one
spark
could
set
aflame
the
whole
of
europe
particularly
at
this
time
when
the
balkan
question
is
before
the
in
many
of
his
addresses
in
america
and
europe
he
gave
similar
warning
in
another
address
in
california
in
october
he
said
we
are
on
the
eve
of
the
battle
of
armageddon
referred
to
in
the
sixteenth
chapter
of
revelation
the
time
is
two
years
hence
when
only
a
spark
will
set
aflame
the
whole
of
europe
the
social
unrest
in
all
countries
the
growing
religious
scepticism
antecedent
to
the
millennium
and
already
here
will
set
aflame
the
whole
of
europe
as
is
prophesied
in
the
book
of
daniel
and
in
the
book
revelation
of
john
by
kingdoms
will
fall
and
cataclysms
will
rock
the
earth
reported
by
corinne
true
in
the
north
shore
review
september
chicago
on
the
eve
of
the
great
conflict
he
said
a
great
melee
of
the
civilized
nations
is
in
sight
a
tremendous
conflict
is
at
hand
the
world
is
at
the
threshold
of
a
most
tragic
struggle
vast
of
being
mobilized
and
stationed
at
their
frontiers
they
are
being
prepared
for
the
fearful
contest
the
slightest
friction
will
bring
them
into
a
terrific
crash
and
there
will
be
a
conflagration
the
like
of
which
is
not
recorded
in
the
past
history
of
mankind
at
haifa
august
social
troubles
after
the
war
both
bahá
u
lláh
and
abdu
also
foretold
a
period
of
great
social
upheaval
conflict
and
calamity
as
an
inevitable
result
of
the
irreligion
and
prejudices
the
ignorance
and
superstition
prevalent
throughout
the
world
the
great
international
military
conflict
was
but
one
phase
of
this
upheaval
in
a
tablet
dated
january
he
wrote
o
ye
lovers
of
truth
o
ye
servants
of
mankind
as
the
sweet
fragrance
of
your
thoughts
and
high
intentions
has
breathed
upon
me
i
feel
that
my
soul
is
irresistibly
prompted
to
communicate
with
you
ponder
in
your
hearts
how
grievous
is
the
turmoil
in
which
the
world
is
plunged
how
the
nations
of
the
earth
are
besmeared
with
human
blood
nay
their
very
soil
is
turned
into
clotted
gore
the
flame
of
war
has
caused
so
wild
a
conflagration
that
the
world
in
its
early
days
in
its
middle
ages
or
in
modern
times
has
never
witnessed
its
like
the
millstones
of
war
have
ground
and
crushed
many
a
human
head
nay
even
more
severe
has
been
the
lot
of
these
victims
flourishing
countries
have
been
made
desolate
cities
have
been
laid
level
with
the
ground
and
smiling
villages
have
been
turned
into
ruin
fathers
have
lost
their
sons
and
sons
turned
fatherless
mothers
have
shed
tears
of
blood
in
mourning
for
their
youths
little
children
have
been
made
orphans
and
women
left
wanderers
and
homeless
in
a
word
humanity
in
all
its
phases
has
been
debased
loud
is
the
cry
and
wailing
of
orphans
and
bitter
the
lamentations
of
mothers
which
are
echoed
by
the
skies
the
prime
cause
for
all
these
happenings
is
racial
national
religious
and
political
prejudice
and
the
root
of
all
this
prejudice
lies
in
outworn
and
deepseated
traditions
be
they
religious
racial
national
or
political
so
long
as
these
traditions
remain
the
foundation
of
human
edifice
is
insecure
and
mankind
itself
is
exposed
to
continuous
peril
now
in
this
radiant
age
when
the
essence
of
all
beings
has
been
made
manifest
and
the
hidden
secret
of
all
created
thing
has
been
revealed
when
the
morning
light
of
truth
has
broken
and
turned
the
darkness
of
the
world
into
light
is
it
meet
and
seemly
that
such
a
frightful
carnage
which
brings
irretrievable
ruin
upon
the
world
should
be
made
possible
by
god
that
can
not
be
christ
summoned
all
the
people
of
the
world
to
reconciliation
and
peace
he
commanded
peter
to
return
his
sword
unto
its
scabbard
such
was
his
wish
and
counsel
and
yet
they
that
bear
his
name
have
unsheathed
the
sword
how
great
the
difference
between
their
deeds
and
the
explicit
text
of
the
gospel
sixty
years
ago
bahá
u
lláh
even
as
the
shining
sun
shone
in
the
firmament
of
persia
and
proclaimed
that
the
world
is
wrapt
in
darkness
and
this
darkness
is
fraught
with
disastrous
results
and
will
lead
to
fearful
strife
in
his
prison
city
of
akká
he
apostrophized
in
unmistakable
terms
the
emperor
of
germany
declaring
that
a
terrible
war
shall
take
place
and
berlin
will
break
forth
in
lamentation
and
wailing
in
like
manner
whilst
the
wronged
prisoner
of
the
sulṭán
of
turkey
in
the
citadel
of
akká
he
clearly
and
emphatically
wrote
him
that
constantinople
will
fall
a
prey
to
grave
disorder
in
such
wise
that
the
women
and
children
will
raise
their
moaning
cry
in
brief
he
addressed
epistles
to
all
the
chief
rulers
and
sovereigns
of
the
world
and
all
that
he
foretold
has
been
fulfilled
from
his
pen
of
glory
flowed
teachings
for
the
prevention
of
war
and
these
have
been
scattered
far
and
wide
his
first
teaching
is
the
search
after
truth
blind
imitation
he
declared
killeth
the
spirit
of
man
whereas
the
investigation
of
truth
frees
the
world
from
the
darkness
of
prejudice
his
second
teaching
is
the
oneness
of
mankind
all
men
are
but
one
fold
and
god
the
loving
shepherd
he
bestoweth
upon
them
his
most
great
mercy
and
considers
them
all
as
one
thou
shalt
find
no
difference
amongst
the
creatures
of
they
are
all
his
servants
and
all
seek
his
bounty
his
third
teaching
is
that
religion
is
the
most
mighty
stronghold
it
should
be
conducive
to
unity
rather
than
be
the
cause
of
enmity
and
hate
should
it
lead
to
enmity
and
hate
better
not
have
it
at
all
for
religion
is
even
as
medicine
which
if
it
should
aggravate
the
disease
its
abandonment
would
be
preferred
likewise
religious
racial
national
and
political
prejudice
all
are
subversive
of
the
foundation
of
human
society
all
lead
to
bloodshed
all
heap
ruin
upon
mankind
so
long
as
these
remain
the
dread
of
war
will
continue
the
sole
remedy
is
universal
peace
and
this
is
achieved
only
by
the
establishment
of
a
supreme
tribunal
representative
of
all
governments
and
peoples
all
national
and
international
problems
should
be
referred
to
this
tribunal
and
whatsoever
be
its
decision
that
should
be
enforced
were
a
government
or
people
to
dissent
the
world
as
a
whole
should
rise
against
it
and
among
his
teachings
is
the
equality
in
right
of
men
and
women
and
so
on
with
many
other
similar
teachings
that
have
been
revealed
by
his
pen
at
present
it
has
been
made
evident
and
manifest
that
these
principles
are
the
very
life
of
the
world
and
the
embodiment
of
its
true
spirit
and
now
ye
who
are
the
servants
of
mankind
should
exert
yourselves
heart
and
soul
to
free
the
world
from
the
darkness
of
materialism
and
human
prejudice
that
it
may
be
illumined
with
the
light
of
the
city
of
god
praise
be
to
him
ye
are
acquainted
with
the
various
schools
institutions
and
principles
of
the
world
today
nothing
short
of
these
divine
teachings
can
assure
peace
and
tranquillity
to
mankind
but
for
these
teachings
this
darkness
shall
never
vanish
these
chronic
diseases
shall
never
be
healed
nay
they
shall
grow
fiercer
from
day
to
day
the
balkans
will
remain
restless
and
it
condition
will
aggravate
the
vanquished
will
not
keep
still
but
will
seize
every
means
to
kindle
anew
the
flame
of
war
modern
universal
movements
will
do
their
utmost
to
carry
out
their
purpose
and
intentions
the
movement
of
the
left
will
acquire
great
importance
and
its
influence
will
spread
wherefore
endeavor
that
with
an
illumined
heart
a
heavenly
spirit
and
a
divine
strength
and
aided
by
his
grace
ye
may
bestow
god
s
bountiful
gift
upon
the
world
the
gift
of
comfort
and
tranquillity
for
all
mankind
in
a
talk
given
in
november
he
said
bahá
u
lláh
frequently
predicted
that
there
would
be
a
period
when
irreligion
and
consequent
anarchy
would
prevail
the
chaos
will
be
due
to
too
great
liberty
among
people
who
are
not
ready
for
it
and
in
consequence
there
will
have
to
be
a
temporary
reversion
to
coercive
government
in
the
interests
of
the
people
themselves
and
in
order
to
prevent
disorder
and
chaos
it
is
clear
that
each
nation
now
wishes
complete
and
freedom
of
action
but
some
of
them
are
not
ready
for
it
the
prevailing
state
of
the
world
is
one
of
irreligion
which
is
bound
to
result
in
anarchy
and
confusion
i
have
always
said
that
the
peace
proposals
following
the
great
war
were
only
a
glimmer
of
the
dawn
and
not
the
sunrise
coming
of
the
kingdom
of
god
amid
these
troublous
times
however
the
cause
of
god
will
prosper
the
calamities
caused
by
selfish
struggle
for
individual
existence
or
for
party
or
sectarian
or
national
gain
will
induce
the
people
to
turn
in
despair
to
the
remedy
offered
by
the
word
of
god
the
more
calamities
abound
the
more
will
the
people
turn
to
the
only
true
remedy
bahá
u
lláh
says
in
his
epistle
to
the
god
hath
made
afflictions
as
a
morning
shower
to
this
green
pasture
and
as
a
wick
for
his
lamp
whereby
earth
and
heaven
are
illumined
through
affliction
hath
his
light
shone
and
his
praise
been
bright
unceasingly
this
hath
been
his
method
through
past
ages
and
bygone
times
both
bahá
u
lláh
and
abdu
predict
in
the
most
confident
terms
the
speedy
triumph
of
spirituality
over
materiality
and
the
consequent
establishment
of
the
most
great
peace
abdu
wrote
in
know
this
that
hardships
and
misfortunes
shall
increase
day
by
day
and
the
people
shall
be
distressed
the
doors
of
joy
and
happiness
shall
be
closed
on
all
sides
terrible
wars
shall
happen
disappointment
and
the
frustration
of
hopes
shall
surround
the
people
from
every
direction
until
they
are
obliged
to
turn
to
god
then
the
lights
of
great
happiness
shall
enlighten
the
horizons
so
that
the
cry
of
yá
bahá
u
may
arise
on
all
to
quoted
in
compilation
on
war
and
peace
when
asked
in
february
whether
any
of
the
great
powers
would
become
believers
he
replied
all
the
people
of
the
world
will
become
believers
should
you
compare
the
beginning
of
the
cause
with
its
position
today
you
would
see
what
a
quick
influence
the
word
of
god
has
and
now
the
cause
of
god
has
encompassed
the
world
unquestionably
all
will
come
under
the
shadow
of
the
cause
of
god
he
declared
that
the
establishment
of
world
unity
will
come
about
during
the
present
century
in
one
of
his
tablets
he
wrote
all
the
members
of
the
human
family
whether
peoples
or
governments
cities
or
villages
have
become
increasingly
interdependent
for
none
is
any
longer
possible
inasmuch
as
political
ties
unite
all
peoples
and
nations
and
the
bonds
of
trade
and
industry
of
agriculture
and
education
are
being
strengthened
every
day
hence
the
unity
of
all
mankind
can
in
this
day
be
achieved
verily
this
is
none
other
but
one
of
the
wonders
of
this
wondrous
age
this
glorious
century
of
been
endowed
with
the
unique
and
unprecedented
glory
power
and
illumination
hence
the
miraculous
unfolding
of
a
fresh
marvel
every
day
eventually
it
will
be
seen
how
bright
its
candles
will
burn
in
the
assemblage
of
man
in
the
last
two
verses
of
the
book
of
daniel
occur
the
cryptic
words
blessed
is
he
that
waiteth
and
cometh
to
the
thousand
three
hundred
and
five
and
thirty
days
but
go
thy
way
till
the
end
be
for
thou
shalt
rest
and
stand
in
thy
lot
at
the
end
of
the
many
have
been
the
attempts
of
learned
students
to
solve
the
problem
of
the
significance
of
these
words
in
a
tabletalk
at
which
the
writer
was
present
abdu
reckoned
the
fulfillment
of
daniel
s
prophecy
from
the
date
of
the
beginning
of
the
muḥammadan
era
abdu
s
tablets
make
it
clear
that
this
prophecy
refers
to
the
one
hundredth
anniversary
of
the
declaration
of
bahá
u
lláh
in
or
the
year
now
concerning
the
verse
in
daniel
the
interpretation
whereof
thou
didst
ask
namely
blessed
is
he
who
cometh
unto
the
thousand
three
hundred
and
these
days
must
be
reckoned
as
solar
and
not
lunar
years
for
according
to
this
calculation
a
century
will
have
elapsed
from
the
dawn
of
the
sun
of
truth
then
will
the
teachings
of
god
be
firmly
established
upon
the
earth
and
the
divine
light
shall
flood
the
world
from
the
east
even
unto
the
west
then
on
this
day
will
the
faithful
rejoice
akká
and
haifa
mírzá
aḥmad
sohrab
recorded
in
his
diary
the
following
prophecy
about
akká
and
haifa
uttered
by
abdu
while
seated
by
the
window
of
one
of
the
bahá
í
pilgrim
homes
at
haifa
on
february
the
view
from
the
pilgrim
home
is
very
attractive
especially
as
it
faces
the
blessed
tom
of
bahá
u
lláh
in
the
future
the
distance
between
akká
and
haifa
will
be
built
up
and
the
two
cities
will
join
and
clasp
hands
becoming
the
two
terminal
section
of
one
mighty
metropolis
as
i
look
now
over
this
scene
i
see
so
clearly
that
it
will
become
one
of
the
first
emporiums
of
the
world
this
great
semicircular
bay
will
be
transformed
into
the
finest
harbor
wherein
the
ships
of
all
nations
will
seek
shelter
and
refuge
the
great
vessels
of
all
peoples
will
come
to
this
port
bringing
on
their
decks
thousands
and
thousands
of
men
and
women
from
every
part
of
the
globe
the
mountain
and
the
plain
will
be
dotted
with
the
most
modern
buildings
and
palaces
industries
will
be
established
and
various
institutions
of
philanthropic
nature
will
be
founded
the
flowers
of
civilization
and
culture
from
all
nations
will
be
brought
here
to
blend
their
fragrances
together
and
blaze
the
way
for
the
brotherhood
of
man
wonderful
gardens
orchards
groves
and
parks
will
be
laid
out
on
all
sides
at
night
the
great
city
will
be
lighted
by
electricity
the
entire
harbor
from
akká
to
haifa
will
be
one
path
of
illumination
powerful
searchlights
will
be
placed
on
both
sides
of
mount
carmel
to
guide
the
steamers
mount
carmel
itself
from
top
to
bottom
will
be
submerged
in
a
sea
of
lights
a
person
standing
on
the
summit
of
mount
carmel
and
the
passengers
of
the
steamers
coming
to
it
will
look
upon
the
most
sublime
and
majestic
spectacle
of
the
whole
world
from
every
part
of
the
mountain
the
symphony
of
yá
bahá
u
will
be
raised
and
before
the
daybreak
music
accompanied
by
melodious
voices
will
be
uplifted
towards
the
throne
of
the
almighty
indeed
god
s
ways
are
mysterious
and
unsearchable
what
outward
relation
exists
between
and
ṭihrán
and
constantinople
adrianople
and
akká
and
haifa
god
worked
patiently
step
by
step
through
these
various
cities
according
to
his
own
definite
and
eternal
plan
so
that
the
prophecies
and
predictions
as
foretold
by
the
prophets
might
be
fulfilled
this
golden
thread
of
promise
concerning
the
messianic
millennium
runs
through
the
bible
and
it
was
so
destined
that
god
in
his
own
good
time
would
cause
its
appearance
not
even
a
single
word
will
be
left
meaningless
and
unfulfilled
chapter
retrospect
and
prospect
i
bear
witness
o
friends
that
the
favor
is
complete
the
argument
fulfilled
the
proof
manifest
and
the
evidence
established
let
it
now
be
seen
what
your
endeavors
in
the
path
of
detachment
will
reveal
in
this
wise
hath
the
divine
favor
been
fully
vouchsafed
unto
you
and
unto
them
that
are
in
heaven
and
on
earth
all
praise
to

the
lord

the
hidden
words
progress
of
the
cause
unfortunately
it
is
impossible
within
the
space
at
our
disposal
to
describe
in
detail
the
progress
of
the
bahá
í
faith
throughout
the
world
many
chapters
might
be
devoted
to
this
fascinating
subject
and
many
thrilling
stories
related
about
the
pioneers
and
martyrs
of
the
cause
but
a
very
brief
summary
must
surface
in
persia
the
early
believers
in
this
revelation
met
with
the
utmost
opposition
persecution
and
cruelty
at
the
hands
of
their
fellow
countrymen
but
they
faced
all
calamities
and
ordeals
with
sublime
heroism
firmness
and
patience
their
baptism
was
in
their
own
blood
for
many
thousands
of
them
perished
as
martyrs
while
thousands
more
were
beaten
imprisoned
stripped
of
their
possessions
driven
from
their
homes
or
otherwise
for
sixty
years
or
more
anyone
in
persia
who
dared
to
own
allegiance
to
the
báb
or
bahá
u
lláh
did
so
at
the
risk
of
his
property
his
freedom
and
even
his
life
yet
this
determined
and
ferocious
opposition
could
not
more
check
the
progress
of
the
movement
than
a
cloud
of
dust
could
keep
the
sun
from
rising
from
one
end
of
persia
to
the
other
bahá
ís
are
now
to
be
found
in
almost
every
city
and
town
and
even
amongst
the
nomad
tribes
in
some
villages
the
whole
population
is
bahá
í
and
in
other
places
a
large
proportion
of
the
inhabitants
are
believers
recruited
from
many
and
diverse
sects
which
were
bitterly
hostile
to
each
other
they
now
form
a
great
fellowship
of
friends
who
acknowledge
brotherhood
not
only
with
each
other
but
with
all
men
everywhere
who
are
working
for
the
unification
and
upliftment
of
humanity
for
the
removal
of
all
prejudices
and
conflict
and
for
the
establishment
of
the
kingdom
of
god
in
the
world
what
miracle
could
be
greater
than
this
only
one
and
that
the
accomplishment
throughout
the
entire
world
of
the
task
to
which
these
men
have
set
themselves
and
signs
are
not
lacking
that
this
greater
miracle
too
is
in
progress
the
faith
is
showing
an
astonishing
vitality
and
is
spreading
like
leaven
through
the
lump
of
humanity
transforming
people
and
society
as
its
spreads
the
relatively
small
number
of
bahá
ís
may
still
seem
insignificant
in
comparison
with
the
followers
of
the
ancient
religions
but
they
are
confident
that
a
divine
power
has
blessed
them
with
the
high
privilege
of
serving
a
new
order
into
which
will
throng
the
multitudes
of
east
and
west
at
no
distant
day
while
therefore
it
remains
true
that
the
holy
spirit
has
reflected
from
pure
hearts
in
all
countries
still
unconscious
of
the
source
and
the
growth
of
the
faith
can
be
witnessed
in
the
many
efforts
outside
the
bahá
í
community
to
promote
one
or
another
of
bahá
u
lláh
s
teachings
nevertheless
the
lack
of
any
enduring
foundation
in
the
old
order
is
convincing
proof
that
the
ideals
of
the
kingdom
can
only
become
fruitful
within
the
framework
of
the
bahá
í
community
prophethood
of
báb
and
bahá
u
lláh
the
more
we
study
the
lives
and
teachings
of
the
báb
and
bahá
u
lláh
the
more
impossible
does
it
seem
to
find
any
explanation
of
their
greatness
except
that
of
divine
inspiration
they
were
reared
in
an
atmosphere
of
fanaticism
and
bigotry
they
had
only
the
most
elementary
education
they
had
no
contact
with
western
culture
they
had
no
political
or
financial
power
to
back
them
they
asked
nothing
from
men
and
receive
little
but
injustice
and
oppression
the
great
ones
of
earth
ignored
or
opposed
them
they
were
scourged
and
tortured
imprisoned
and
subjected
to
direst
calamities
in
the
fulfillment
of
their
mission
they
were
alone
against
the
world
having
no
help
but
that
of
god
yet
already
their
triumph
is
manifest
and
magnificent
the
grandeur
and
sublimity
of
their
ideals
the
nobility
and
of
their
lives
their
dauntless
courage
and
conviction
their
amazing
wisdom
and
knowledge
their
grasp
of
the
needs
of
both
eastern
and
western
peoples
the
comprehensiveness
and
adequacy
of
their
teachings
their
power
to
inspire
wholehearted
devotion
and
enthusiasm
in
their
followers
the
penetration
and
potency
of
their
influence
the
progress
of
the
movement
they
these
constitute
proofs
of
prophethood
as
convincing
as
any
which
the
history
of
religion
can
show
a
glorious
prospect
the
bahá
í
glad
tidings
disclose
a
vision
of
the
bounty
of
god
and
of
the
future
progress
of
humanity
which
is
surely
the
greatest
and
most
glorious
revelation
ever
given
to
mankind
the
development
and
fulfillment
of
all
previous
revelations
its
purpose
is
nothing
less
than
the
regeneration
of
mankind
and
the
creation
of
new
heavens
and
a
new
it
is
the
same
task
to
which
christ
and
all
the
prophets
have
devoted
their
lives
and
between
these
great
teachers
there
is
no
rivalry
it
is
not
by
this
manifestation
or
by
that
but
by
all
together
that
the
task
will
be
accomplished
as
abdu
says
it
is
not
necessary
to
lower
abraham
to
raise
jesus
it
is
not
necessary
to
lower
jesus
to
proclaim
bahá
u
lláh
we
must
welcome
the
truth
of
god
wherever
we
behold
it
the
essence
of
the
question
is
that
all
these
great
messengers
came
to
raise
the
divine
standard
of
perfections
all
of
them
shine
as
orbs
in
the
same
heaven
of
the
divine
will
all
of
them
give
light
to
the
world
the
task
is
god
s
and
god
calls
not
only
the
prophets
but
all
mankind
to
be
his
in
this
creative
process
if
we
refuse
his
invitation
we
shall
not
hinder
the
work
from
going
on
for
what
god
wills
shall
surely
come
to
pass
if
we
fail
to
play
our
part
he
can
raise
up
other
instruments
to
perform
his
purpose
but
we
shall
miss
the
real
aim
and
object
of
our
own
lives
with
his
lovers
his
servants
the
willing
channels
and
mediums
of
his
creative
power
so
that
we
are
conscious
of
no
life
within
us
but
his
divine
and
abundant
according
to
the
bahá
í
teaching
is
the
ineffable
and
glorious
consummation
of
human
existence
humanity
however
is
sound
at
heart
for
it
is
made
in
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
and
when
at
last
it
sees
the
truth
it
will
not
persist
in
the
paths
of
folly
bahá
u
lláh
assures
us
that
erelong
the
call
of
god
will
be
generally
accepted
and
mankind
as
a
whole
will
turn
to
righteousness
and
obedience
all
sorrow
will
then
be
turned
into
joy
and
all
disease
into
health
and
the
kingdoms
of
this
world
shall
become
the
kingdoms
of
our
lord
and
of
his
christ
and
he
shall
reign
for
ever
and
ever
rev
xi
not
only
those
on
earth
but
all
in
the
heavens
and
on
the
earth
shall
become
one
in
god
and
rejoice
eternally
in
him
renewal
of
religion
the
state
of
the
world
today
surely
affords
ample
evidence
that
with
rare
exceptions
people
of
all
religions
need
to
be
reawakened
to
the
real
meaning
of
their
religion
and
that
reawakening
is
an
important
part
of
the
work
of
bahá
u
lláh
he
comes
to
make
christians
better
christians
to
make
muslims
real
muslims
to
make
all
men
true
to
the
spirit
that
inspired
their
prophets
he
also
fulfills
the
promise
made
by
all
these
prophets
of
a
more
glorious
manifestation
which
was
to
appear
in
the
fullness
of
time
to
crown
and
consummate
their
labors
he
gives
a
fuller
unfolding
of
spiritual
truths
than
his
predecessors
and
reveals
the
will
of
god
with
regard
to
all
the
problems
of
individual
and
social
life
that
confront
us
in
the
world
today
he
gives
a
universal
teaching
which
affords
a
firm
foundation
on
which
a
new
and
better
civilization
can
be
built
up
a
teaching
adapted
to
the
needs
of
the
world
in
the
new
era
which
is
now
commencing
need
for
new
revelation
the
unification
of
the
world
of
humanity
the
welding
together
of
the
world
s
different
religions
the
reconciliation
of
religion
and
science
the
establishment
of
universal
peace
of
international
arbitration
of
an
international
house
of
justice
of
an
international
language
the
emancipation
of
women
universal
education
the
abolition
not
only
of
chattel
slavery
but
of
industrial
slavery
the
organization
of
humanity
as
a
single
whole
with
due
regard
to
the
rights
and
liberties
of
each
are
problems
of
gigantic
magnitude
and
stupendous
difficulty
in
relation
to
which
christians
muḥammadans
and
adherents
of
other
religions
have
held
and
still
hold
the
most
diverse
and
often
violently
opposed
views
but
bahá
u
lláh
has
revealed
clearly
defined
principles
the
general
adoption
of
which
would
obviously
make
the
world
a
paradise
truth
is
for
all
many
are
quite
ready
to
admit
that
the
bahá
í
teachings
would
be
a
splendid
thing
for
persia
and
for
the
east
but
imagine
that
for
the
nations
of
the
west
they
are
unnecessary
or
unsuitable
to
one
who
mentioned
such
a
view
abdu
replied
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
cause
of
bahá
u
lláh
whatever
has
to
do
with
the
universal
good
is
divine
and
whatever
is
divine
is
for
the
universal
good
if
it
be
true
it
is
for
all
if
not
it
is
for
no
one
therefore
a
divine
cause
of
universal
good
can
not
be
limited
to
either
the
east
or
the
west
for
the
radiance
of
the
sun
of
truth
illumines
both
the
east
and
the
west
and
it
makes
its
heat
felt
in
the
south
and
in
the
is
no
difference
between
one
pole
and
another
at
the
time
of
the
manifestation
of
christ
the
romans
and
greeks
thought
his
cause
was
especially
for
the
jews
they
thought
they
had
a
perfect
civilization
and
nothing
to
learn
from
christ
s
teachings
and
by
this
false
supposition
many
were
deprived
of
his
grace
likewise
know
that
the
principles
of
christianity
and
the
commandments
of
bahá
u
lláh
are
identical
and
their
paths
are
the
same
every
day
there
is
progress
there
was
a
time
when
this
divine
institution
of
progressive
revelation
was
in
embryo
then
newborn
then
a
child
then
an
intellectual
youth
but
today
it
is
resplendent
with
beauty
and
shining
with
the
greatest
brilliancy
happy
is
he
who
penetrates
the
mystery
and
takes
his
place
in
the
world
of
the
illumined
ones
the
last
will
and
testament
of
abdu
with
the
passing
of
its
beloved
leader
abdu
the
bahá
í
faith
entered
on
a
new
phase
of
its
history
this
new
phase
represents
a
higher
state
in
the
existence
of
the
same
spiritual
organism
a
more
mature
and
consequently
a
more
responsible
expression
of
the
faith
felt
by
its
members
abdu
had
devoted
his
superhuman
energy
and
unique
capacity
to
the
task
of
spreading
his
love
for
bahá
u
lláh
throughout
the
east
and
west
he
had
lighted
the
candle
of
faith
in
countless
souls
he
had
trained
and
guided
them
in
the
attributes
of
the
personal
spiritual
life
in
view
of
the
momentous
importance
of
the
last
will
and
testament
of
abdu
the
gravity
of
the
issues
it
raises
and
the
profound
wisdom
underlying
its
provisions
we
give
a
few
extracts
which
vividly
portray
the
spirit
and
leading
principles
which
animated
and
guided
abdu
and
are
transmitted
as
a
rich
heritage
to
his
faithful
followers
o
ye
beloved
of
the
lord
in
this
sacred
dispensation
conflict
and
contention
are
in
no
wise
permitted
every
aggressor
deprives
himself
of
god
s
grace
it
is
incumbent
upon
everyone
to
show
the
utmost
love
rectitude
of
conduct
straight
forwardness
and
sincere
kindliness
unto
all
the
peoples
and
kindreds
of
the
world
be
they
friends
or
strangers
so
intense
must
be
the
spirit
of
love
and
loving
kindness
that
the
stranger
may
find
himself
a
friend
the
enemy
a
true
brother
no
difference
whatsoever
existing
between
them
for
universality
is
of
god
and
all
limitations
earthly
wherefore
o
my
loving
friends
consort
with
all
the
peoples
kindreds
and
religions
of
the
world
with
the
utmost
truthfulness
uprightness
faithfulness
kindliness
and
friendliness
that
all
the
world
of
being
may
be
filled
with
the
holy
ecstasy
of
the
grace
of
bahá
that
ignorance
enmity
hate
and
rancor
may
vanish
from
the
world
and
the
darkness
of
estrangement
amidst
the
peoples
and
kindreds
of
the
world
may
give
way
to
the
light
of
unity
should
other
peoples
and
nations
be
unfaithful
to
you
show
your
fidelity
unto
them
should
they
keep
aloof
from
you
attract
them
to
yourself
should
they
show
their
enmity
be
friendly
towards
them
should
they
poison
your
lives
sweeten
their
souls
should
they
inflict
a
wound
upon
you
be
a
salve
to
their
sores
such
are
the
attributes
of
the
sincere
such
are
the
attributes
of
the
truthful
o
ye
beloved
of
the
lord
it
is
incumbent
upon
you
to
be
submissive
to
all
monarchs
that
are
just
and
to
show
your
fidelity
to
every
righteous
king
serve
ye
the
sovereigns
of
the
world
with
utmost
truthfulness
and
loyalty
show
obedience
unto
them
and
be
their
without
their
leave
and
permission
do
not
meddle
with
political
affairs
for
disloyalty
to
the
just
sovereign
is
disloyalty
to
god
himself
this
is
my
counsel
and
the
commandment
of
god
unto
you
well
is
it
with
them
that
act
accordingly
lord
thou
seest
all
things
weeping
over
me
and
my
kindred
rejoicing
in
my
woes
by
thy
glory
o
my
god
even
amongst
mine
enemies
some
have
lamented
my
troubles
and
my
distress
and
of
the
envious
ones
a
number
have
shed
tears
because
of
my
cares
my
exile
and
my
afflictions
they
did
this
because
they
found
naught
in
me
but
affection
and
care
and
witnessed
naught
but
kindliness
and
mercy
as
they
saw
me
swept
into
the
flood
of
tribulation
and
adversity
and
exposed
even
as
a
target
to
the
arrows
of
fate
their
hearts
were
moved
with
the
lord
is
our
witness
naught
have
we
seen
from
him
but
faithfulness
generosity
and
extreme
the
foreboders
of
evil
however
waxed
fiercer
in
their
rancor
rejoiced
as
i
fell
a
victim
to
the
most
grievous
ordeal
bestirred
themselves
against
me
and
made
merry
over
the
heartrending
happenings
around
me
i
call
upon
thee
o
lord
my
god
with
my
tongue
and
with
all
my
heart
not
to
require
them
for
their
cruelty
and
their
their
craft
and
their
mischief
for
they
are
foolish
and
ignoble
and
know
not
what
they
do
they
discern
not
good
from
evil
neither
do
they
distinguish
right
from
wrong
nor
justice
from
injustice
they
follow
their
own
desires
and
walk
in
the
footsteps
of
the
most
imperfect
and
foolish
amongst
them
o
my
lord
have
mercy
upon
them
shield
them
from
all
afflictions
in
these
troubled
times
and
grant
that
all
trials
and
hardships
may
be
the
lot
of
this
thy
servant
that
hath
fallen
into
this
darksome
pit
single
me
out
for
every
woe
and
make
me
a
sacrifice
for
all
thy
loved
ones
o
lord
most
high
may
my
soul
my
life
my
being
my
spirit
my
all
be
offered
up
for
them
o
god
my
god
lowly
suppliant
and
fallen
upon
my
face
i
beseech
thee
with
all
the
ardor
of
my
invocation
to
pardon
whosoever
hath
hurt
me
forgive
him
that
hath
conspired
against
me
and
offended
me
and
wash
away
the
misdeeds
of
them
that
have
wrought
injustice
upon
me
vouchsafe
unto
them
thy
goodly
gifts
give
them
joy
relieve
them
from
sorrow
grant
them
peace
and
prosperity
give
them
thy
bliss
and
pour
upon
them
thy
bounty
thou
art
the
powerful
the
gracious
the
help
in
peril
the
the
disciples
of
christ
forgot
themselves
and
all
earthy
things
forsook
all
their
cares
and
belongings
purged
themselves
of
self
and
passion
and
with
absolute
detachment
scattered
far
and
wide
and
engaged
in
calling
the
peoples
of
the
world
to
the
divine
guidance
till
at
last
they
made
the
world
another
world
illumined
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
even
to
their
last
hour
proved
in
the
pathway
of
that
beloved
one
of
god
finally
in
various
lands
they
suffered
glorious
martyrdom
let
them
that
are
men
of
action
follow
in
their
footsteps
o
god
my
god
i
call
thee
thy
prophets
and
thy
messengers
thy
saints
and
thy
holy
ones
to
witness
that
i
have
declared
conclusively
thy
proofs
unto
thy
loved
ones
and
set
forth
clearly
all
things
unto
them
that
they
may
watch
over
thy
faith
guard
thy
straight
path
and
protect
thy
resplendent
law
thou
art
verily
the
the
with
abdu
s
passing
the
time
had
come
to
establish
the
administrative
order
which
has
been
termed
the
pattern
and
nucleus
of
the
world
order
which
it
is
the
special
mission
of
the
religion
of
bahá
u
lláh
to
establish
the
will
and
testament
of
abdu
consequently
marks
a
turning
point
in
bahá
í
history
dividing
the
era
of
immaturity
and
irresponsibility
from
that
era
in
which
the
bahá
ís
themselves
are
destined
to
fulfill
their
spirituality
by
enlarging
its
scope
from
the
realm
of
personal
experience
to
that
of
social
unity
and
cooperation
the
three
principal
elements
in
the
administrative
plan
left
by
abdu
are
the
guardian
of
the
cause
of
god
the
hands
of
the
cause
of
god
and
the
houses
of
justice
local
national
and
the
guardian

abdu
appointed
his

the

of

not

at

the
announcement
of
his

is
made
in

will
as
follows
o
my
loving

after
the
passing
away
of
this
wronged
one
it

the
two
hallowed
and
sacred
and
the
fruit
grown
from
the
union
of
the
two
offshoots
of
the
tree
of

he

the

the

he
unto
whom
all
the
the
afnán
the
hands
of
the
cause
of

and
his
loved

must
turn
he
is
the
expounder
of
the
words
of
god
and
after
him
will
succeed
the
of
his
lineal
descendants
the
sacred
and
youthful
branch
the
guardian
of
the
cause
of

as
well
as
the
universal

established
are
both
under
the
care
and
protection
of
the
abhá

under
the
shelter
and
unerring
guidance
of
his
holiness
the
exalted
one
may
my
life
be
offered
up
for
them
both
whatsoever
they
decide
is
of

o
ye
beloved
of
the
lord
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
guardian
of
the
cause
of
god
to
appoint
in
his
own
lifetime
him
that
shall
become
his
successor
that
differences
may
not
arise
after
his
passing
he
that
is
appointed
must
manifest
in
himself
detachment
from
all
worldly
things
must
be
the
essence
of
purity
must
show
in
himself
the
fear
of
god
knowledge
wisdom
and
learning
thus
should
the
of
the
guardian
of
the
cause
of
god
not
manifest
in
himself
the
truth
of
the
words
the
child
is
the
secret
essence
of
its
sire
that
is
should
he
not
inherit
of
the
spiritual
within
him
the
guardian
of
the
cause
of
god
and
his
glorious
lineage
not
be
matched
with
a
goodly
character
then
must
he
the
guardian
of
the
cause
of
god
choose
another
branch
to
succeed
him
the
hands
of
the
cause
of
god
must
elect
from
their
own
number
nine
persons
that
shall
at
all
times
be
occupied
in
the
important
services
of
the
work
of
the
guardian
of
the
cause
of
god
the
election
of
these
nine
must
be
carried
either
unanimously
or
by
majority
from
the
company
of
the
hands
of
the
cause
of

and
these
whether
unanimously
or
by
a

must
give
their
assent
to
the
choice
of
the
one
whom
the
guardian

hath
chosen
as
his
successor
this
assent
must
be
given
in
such
wise
as
the
assenting
and
dissenting
voices
may
not
be
distinguished
secret
ballot
hands
of
the
cause
of

during
his
own
lifetime
bahá
u
lláh
appointed
a
few
tried
and
trusted
friends
to
assist
in
directing
and
promoting
the
work
of
the
movement
and
gave
them
the
title
of
lláh
lit
hands
of
the
cause
of
god
abdu
makes
provision
in
his
will
for
the
establishment
of
a
permanent
body
of
workers
to
serve
the
cause
and
help
the
guardian
of
the
cause
he
writes
o
friends
the
hands
of
the
cause
of
god
must
be
nominated
and
appointed
by
the
guardian
of
the
cause
of
god
the
obligations
of
the
hands
of
the
cause
of
god
are
to
diffuse
the
divine
fragrances
to
edify
the
souls
of
men
to
promote
learning
to
improve
the
character
of
all
men
and
to
be
at
all
times
and
under
all
conditions
sanctified
and
detached
from
earthly
things
they
must
manifest
the
fear
of
god
in
their
conduct
their
manners
their
deeds
and
their
words
this
body
of
the
hands
of
the
cause
of
god
is
under
the
direction
of
the
guardian
of
the
cause
of
god
he
must
continually
urge
them
to
strive
and
endeavor
to
the
utmost
of
their
ability
to
diffuse
the
sweet
savors
of
god
and
to
guide
all
the
peoples
of
the
world
for
it
is
the
light
of
divine
guidance
that
causeth
all
the
universe
to
be
illumined
the
administrative
order
it
has
been
the
general
characteristic
of
religion
that
organization
marks
the
interruption
of
the
true
spiritual
influence
and
serves
to
prevent
the
original
impulse
from
being
carried
into
the
world
the
organization
has
invariably
become
a
substitute
for
religion
rather
than
a
method
or
an
instrument
used
to
give
the
religion
effect
the
separation
of
peoples
into
different
traditions
unbridged
by
any
peaceful
or
constructive
intercourse
has
made
this
inevitable
up
to
the
present
time
in
fact
no
founder
of
a
revealed
religion
has
explicitly
laid
down
the
principles
that
should
guide
the
administrative
machinery
of
the
faith
he
has
established
in
the
bahá
í
cause
the
principles
of
world
administration
were
expressed
by
bahá
u
lláh
and
these
principles
were
developed
in
the
writings
of
abdu
more
especially
in
his
will
and
testament
the
purpose
of
this
organization
is
to
make
possible
a
true
and
lasting
unity
among
peoples
of
different
races
classes
interests
characters
and
inherited
creeds
a
close
and
sympathetic
study
of
this
aspect
of
the
bahá
í
cause
will
show
that
the
purpose
and
method
of
bahá
í
administration
is
so
perfectly
adapted
to
the
fundamental
spirit
of
the
revelation
that
it
bears
to
it
the
same
relationship
as
body
to
soul
in
character
the
principles
of
bahá
í
administration
represent
the
science
of
cooperation
in
application
they
provide
for
a
new
and
higher
type
of
morality
worldwide
in
scope
a
bahá
í
community
differs
from
other
voluntary
gatherings
in
that
its
foundation
is
so
deeply
laid
and
broadly
extended
that
it
can
include
any
sincere
soul
whereas
other
associations
are
exclusive
in
effect
if
not
in
intention
and
from
method
if
not
from
ideal
bahá
í
association
is
inclusive
shutting
the
gates
of
fellowship
to
no
sincere
soul
in
every
gathering
there
is
latent
or
developed
some
basis
of
selection
in
religion
this
basis
is
a
creed
limited
by
the
historical
nature
of
its
origin
in
politics
this
is
party
or
platform
in
economics
this
is
a
mutual
misfortune
or
mutual
power
in
the
arts
and
sciences
this
basis
consists
of
special
training
or
activity
or
interest
in
all
these
matters
the
more
exclusive
the
basis
of
selection
the
stronger
the
condition
diametrically
opposed
to
that
existing
in
the
bahá
í
cause
hence
the
cause
for
all
its
spirit
of
growth
and
progress
develops
slowly
as
regards
the
numbers
of
its
active
adherents
for
people
are
accustomed
to
exclusiveness
and
division
in
all
affairs
the
important
sanctions
have
ever
been
warrants
and
justifications
of
division
to
enter
the
bahá
í
movement
is
to
leave
these
sanctions
experience
which
at
first
invariably
exposes
one
to
new
trials
and
sufferings
as
the
human
ego
revolts
against
the
supreme
sanction
of
universal
love
the
scientific
must
associate
with
the
simple
and
unlearned
the
rich
with
the
poor
the
white
with
the
colored
the
mystic
with
the
literalist
the
christian
with
the
jew
the
muslim
with
the
parsee
and
on
terms
removing
the
advantage
of
long
established
presumptions
and
privileges
but
for
this
difficult
experience
there
are
glorious
compensations
let
us
remember
that
art
grows
sterile
as
it
turns
away
from
the
common
humanity
that
philosophy
likewise
loses
its
vision
when
developed
in
solitude
and
that
politics
and
religion
never
succeed
apart
from
the
general
needs
of
mankind
human
nature
is
not
yet
known
for
we
have
all
lived
in
a
state
of
mental
moral
emotional
or
social
defense
and
the
psychology
of
defense
is
the
psychology
of
inhibition
but
the
love
of
god
removes
fear
the
removal
of
fear
establishes
the
latent
power
and
association
with
others
in
spiritual
love
brings
these
powers
into
vital
positive
expression
a
bahá
í
community
is
a
gathering
where
this
process
can
take
place
in
this
age
slowly
at
first
as
the
new
impetus
gathers
force
more
rapidly
as
the
members
become
conscious
of
the
powers
unfolding
the
flower
of
unity
among
men
the
responsibility
for
and
supervision
of
local
bahá
í
affairs
is
vested
in
a
body
known
as
the
spiritual
assembly
this
body
limited
to
nine
members
is
elected
annually
on
april
the
first
day
of
ridván
the
festival
commemorating
the
declaration
of
bahá
u
lláh
by
the
adult
declared
believers
of
the
community
the
voting
list
being
drawn
up
by
the
outgoing
spiritual
assembly
concerning
the
character
and
functions
of
this
body
abdu
has
written
as
follows
it
is
incumbent
upon
every
one
every
believer
not
to
take
any
step
of
bahá
í
activity
without
consulting
the
spiritual
assembly
and
they
must
assuredly
obey
with
heart
and
soul
its
bidding
and
be
submissive
unto
it
that
things
may
be
properly
ordered
and
well
arranged
otherwise
every
person
will
act
independently
and
after
his
own
judgment
will
follow
his
own
desire
and
do
harm
to
the
cause
the
prime
requisites
for
them
that
take
counsel
together
are
purity
of
motive
radiance
of
spirit
detachment
from
all
else
save
god
attraction
to
his
divine
fragrances
humility
and
lowliness
amongst
his
loved
ones
patience
and
in
difficulties
and
servitude
to
his
exalted
threshold
should
they
be
graciously
aided
to
acquire
these
attributes
victory
from
the
unseen
kingdom
of
bahá
shall
be
vouchsafed
to
them
in
this
day
assemblies
of
consultation
are
of
the
greatest
importance
and
a
vital
necessity
obedience
unto
them
is
essential
and
obligatory
the
members
thereof
must
take
counsel
together
in
such
wise
that
no
occasion
for
or
discord
may
arise
this
can
be
attained
when
every
member
expresseth
with
absolute
freedom
his
own
opinion
and
must
on
no
account
feel
hurt
for
not
until
matters
are
fully
discussed
can
the
right
way
be
revealed
the
shining
spark
of
truth
cometh
forth
only
after
the
clash
of
differing
opinions
if
after
discussion
a
decision
be
carried
unanimously
well
and
good
but
if
the
lord
forbid
differences
of
opinion
should
arise
a
majority
of
voices
must
prevail
the
first
condition
is
absolute
love
and
harmony
amongst
the
members
of
the
assembly
they
must
be
wholly
free
from
estrangement
and
must
manifest
in
themselves
the
unity
of
god
for
they
are
the
waves
of
one
sea
the
drops
of
one
river
the
stars
of
one
heaven
the
rays
of
one
sun
the
trees
of
one
orchard
the
flowers
of
one
garden
should
harmony
of
thought
and
absolute
unity
be
that
gathering
shall
be
dispersed
and
that
assembly
be
brought
to
naught
the
second
condition
must
when
coming
together
turn
their
faces
to
the
kingdom
on
high
and
ask
aid
from
the
realm
of
glory
discussions
must
all
be
confined
to
spiritual
matters
that
pertain
to
the
training
of
souls
the
instruction
of
children
the
relief
of
the
poor
the
help
of
the
feeble
throughout
all
classes
in
the
world
kindness
to
all
peoples
the
diffusion
of
the
fragrances
of
god
and
the
exaltation
of
his
holy
word
should
they
endeavor
to
fulfill
these
conditions
the
grace
of
the
holy
spirit
shall
be
vouchsafed
unto
them
and
that
assembly
shall
become
the
center
of
the
divine
blessings
the
hosts
of
divine
confirmation
shall
come
to
their
aid
and
they
shall
day
by
day
receive
a
new
effusion
of
spirit
expounding
this
subject
shoghi
effendi
writes
nothing
whatever
should
be
given
to
the
public
by
any
individual
among
the
friends
unless
fully
considered
and
approved
by
the
spiritual
assembly
in
his
locality
and
if
this
as
is
undoubtedly
the
case
is
a
matter
that
pertains
to
the
general
interest
of
the
cause
in
that
land
then
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
spiritual
assembly
to
submit
it
to
the
consideration
and
approval
of
the
national
body
representing
all
the
various
local
assemblies
not
only
with
regard
to
publication
but
all
matters
without
any
exception
whatsoever
regarding
the
interests
of
the
cause
in
that
locality
individually
or
collectively
should
be
referred
exclusively
to
the
spiritual
assembly
in
that
locality
which
shall
decide
upon
it
unless
it
be
a
matter
of
national
interest
in
which
case
it
shall
be
referred
to
the
national
bahá
í
body
with
this
national
body
also
will
rest
the
decision
whether
a
given
question
is
of
local
or
national
interest
by
national
affairs
is
not
meant
matters
that
are
political
in
their
character
for
the
friends
of
god
the
world
over
are
strictly
forbidden
to
meddle
with
political
affairs
in
any
way
whatsoever
but
rather
things
that
affect
the
spiritual
activities
of
the
body
of
the
friends
in
that
land
full
harmony
however
as
well
as
cooperation
among
the
various
local
assemblies
and
the
members
themselves
and
particularly
between
each
assembly
and
the
national
body
is
of
the
utmost
importance
for
upon
it
depends
the
unity
of
the
cause
of
god
the
solidarity
of
the
friends
the
full
speedy
and
efficient
working
of
the
spiritual
activities
of
his
loved
ones
the
various
assemblies
local
and
national
constitute
today
the
bedrock
upon
the
strength
of
which
the
universal
house
of
justice
is
in
future
to
be
firmly
established
and
raised
not
until
these
function
vigorously
and
harmoniously
can
the
hope
for
the
termination
of
this
period
of
transition
be
realized
bear
in
mind
that
the
keynote
of
the
cause
of
god
is
not
dictatorial
authority
but
humble
fellowship
not
arbitrary
power
but
the
spirit
of
frank
and
loving
consultation
nothing
short
of
the
spirit
of
a
true
bahá
í
can
hope
to
reconcile
the
principles
of
mercy
and
justice
of
freedom
and
submission
of
the
sanctity
of
the
right
of
the
individual
and
of
of
vigilance
discretion
and
prudence
on
the
one
hand
and
fellowship
candor
and
courage
on
the
other
the
local
spiritual
assemblies
of
a
country
are
linked
together
and
through
another
elected
body
of
nine
members
the
national
spiritual
assembly
this
body
comes
into
being
by
means
of
an
annual
election
held
by
elected
delegates
representing
the
local
bahá
í
communities
the
national
convention
in
which
the
delegates
are
gather
together
is
composed
of
an
elective
body
based
upon
the
principle
of
proportional
representation
these
national
conventions
are
preferably
held
during
the
period
of
ridván
the
twelve
days
beginning
april
which
commemorate
the
declaration
made
by
bahá
u
lláh
in
the
garden
of
ridván
near
the
recognition
of
delegates
is
vested
in
the
outgoing
national
spiritual
assembly
a
national
convention
is
an
occasion
for
deepening
one
s
understanding
of
bahá
í
activities
and
of
sharing
reports
of
national
and
local
activities
for
the
period
of
the
elapsed
year
the
function
of
a
bahá
í
delegate
is
limited
to
the
duration
of
the
national
convention
and
participation
in
the
election
of
the
new
national
spiritual
assembly
while
gathered
together
the
delegates
are
a
consultative
and
advisory
body
whose
recommendations
are
to
be
carefully
considered
by
the
members
of
the
elected
national
spiritual
assembly
the
relation
of
the
national
spiritual
assembly
to
the
local
spiritual
assemblies
and
to
the
body
of
the
believers
in
the
country
is
thus
defined
in
the
letters
of
the
guardian
of
the
cause
regarding
the
establishment
of
national
assemblies
it
is
of
vital
importance
that
in
every
country
where
the
conditions
are
favorable
and
the
number
of
the
friends
has
grown
and
reached
a
considerable
size
that
a
national
spiritual
assembly
be
immediately
established
representative
of
the
friends
throughout
that
country
its
immediate
purpose
is
to
stimulate
unify
and
coordinate
by
frequent
personal
consultations
the
manifold
activities
of
the
friends
as
well
as
the
local
assemblies
and
by
keeping
in
close
and
constant
touch
with
the
holy
land
initiate
measures
and
direct
in
general
the
affairs
of
the
cause
in
that
country
it
serves
also
another
purpose
no
less
essential
than
the
first
as
in
the
course
of
time
it
shall
evolve
into
the
national
house
of
justice
referred
to
in
abdu
s
will
as
the
secondary
house
of
justice
which
according
to
the
explicit
text
of
the
testament
will
have
in
conjunction
with
the
other
national
assemblies
throughout
the
bahá
í
world
to
elect
directly
the
members
of
the
international
house
of
justice
that
supreme
council
that
will
guide
organize
and
unify
the
affairs
of
the
movement
throughout
the
world
this
national
spiritual
assembly
which
pending
the
establishment
of
the
universal
house
of
justice
will
have
to
be
once
a
year
obviously
assumes
grave
responsibilities
for
it
has
to
exercise
full
authority
over
all
the
local
assemblies
in
its
province
and
will
have
to
direct
the
activities
of
the
friends
guard
vigilantly
the
cause
of
god
and
control
and
supervise
the
affairs
of
the
movement
in
general
vital
issues
affecting
the
interests
of
the
cause
in
that
country
such
as
the
matter
of
translation
and
publication
the
the
teaching
work
and
other
similar
matters
that
stand
distinct
from
strictly
local
affairs
must
be
under
the
full
jurisdiction
of
the
national
assembly
it
will
have
to
refer
each
of
these
questions
even
as
the
local
assemblies
to
a
special
committee
to
be
elected
by
the
members
of
the
national
spiritual
assembly
from
among
all
the
friends
in
that
country
which
will
bear
to
it
the
same
relation
as
the
local
committees
bear
to
their
respective
local
assemblies
with
it
too
rests
the
decision
whether
a
certain
point
at
issue
is
strictly
local
in
its
nature
and
should
be
reserved
for
the
consideration
and
decision
of
the
local
assembly
or
whether
it
should
fall
under
its
own
province
and
be
regarded
as
a
matter
which
ought
to
receive
its
special
attention
it
is
bounden
duty
in
the
interest
of
the
cause
we
all
love
and
serve
of
the
members
of
the
incoming
national
assembly
once
elected
by
the
delegates
at
convention
time
to
seek
and
have
the
utmost
regard
individually
as
well
as
collectively
for
the
advice
the
considered
opinion
and
the
true
sentiments
of
the
assembled
delegates
banishing
every
vestige
of
secrecy
of
undue
reticence
of
dictatorial
aloofness
from
their
midst
they
should
radiantly
and
abundantly
unfold
to
the
eyes
of
the
delegates
by
whom
they
are
elected
their
plans
their
hopes
and
their
cares
they
should
familiarize
the
delegates
with
the
various
matters
that
will
have
to
be
considered
in
the
current
year
and
calmly
and
conscientiously
study
and
weigh
the
opinions
and
judgments
of
the
delegates
the
newly
elected
national
assembly
during
the
few
days
when
the
convention
is
in
session
and
after
the
dispersal
of
the
delegates
should
seek
ways
and
means
to
cultivate
understanding
facilitate
and
maintain
the
exchange
of
views
deepen
confidence
and
vindicate
by
every
tangible
evidence
their
one
desire
to
serve
and
advance
the
common
weal
the
national
spiritual
assembly
however
in
view
of
the
unavoidable
limitations
imposed
upon
the
convening
of
frequent
and
sessions
of
the
convention
will
have
to
retain
in
its
hands
the
final
decision
on
all
matters
that
affect
the
interests
of
the
cause
such
as
the
right
to
decide
whether
any
local
assembly
is
functioning
in
accordance
with
the
principles
laid
down
for
the
conduct
and
the
advancement
of
the
cause
concerning
the
matter
of
drawing
up
the
voting
list
to
be
used
at
the
annual
local
bahá
í
elections
the
responsibility
for
this
is
placed
upon
each
local
spiritual
assembly
and
as
a
guidance
in
the
matter
the
guardian
has
written
the
following
to
state
very
briefly
and
as
adequately
as
present
circumstances
permit
the
principal
factors
that
must
be
taken
into
consideration
before
deciding
whether
a
person
may
be
regarded
as
a
true
believer
or
not
full
recognition
of
the
station
of
the
forerunner
the
author
and
the
true
exemplar
of
the
bahá
í
cause
as
set
forth
in
abdu
s
testament
unreserved
acceptance
of
and
submission
to
whatsoever
has
been
revealed
by
their
pen
loyal
and
steadfast
adherence
to
every
clause
of
our
beloved
s
sacred
will
and
close
association
with
the
spirit
as
well
as
the
form
of
the
present
day
bahá
í
administration
throughout
the
i
conceive
to
be
the
fundamental
and
primary
considerations
that
must
be
fairly
discreetly
and
thoughtfully
ascertained
before
reaching
such
a
vital
decision
abdu
s
instructions
provide
for
the
further
development
of
bahá
í
organization
and
now
concerning
the
house
of
justice
which
god
hath
ordained
as
the
source
of
all
good
and
freed
from
all
error
it
must
be
elected
by
universal
suffrage
that
is
by
the
believers
its
members
must
be
manifestations
of
the
fear
of
god
and
daysprings
of
knowledge
and
understanding
must
be
steadfast
in
god
s
faith
and
the
of
all
mankind
by
this
house
is
meant
the
universal
house
of
justice
that
is
in
all
countries
a
secondary
house
of
justice
must
be
instituted
and
these
secondary
houses
of
justice
must
elect
the
members
of
the
universal
one
unto
this
body
all
things
must
be
referred
it
enacted
all
ordinances
and
regulations
that
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
explicit
holy
text
by
this
body
all
the
difficult
problems
are
to
be
resolved
and
the
guardian
of
the
cause
of
god
is
its
sacred
head
and
the
distinguished
member
for
life
of
that
body
should
he
not
attend
in
person
its
deliberations
he
must
appoint
one
to
represent
him
this
house
of
justice
enacteth
the
laws
and
the
government
enforceth
them
the
legislative
body
must
reinforce
the
executive
the
executive
must
aid
and
assist
the
legislative
body
so
that
through
the
close
union
and
harmony
of
these
two
forces
the
foundation
of
fairness
and
justice
may
become
firm
and
strong
that
all
the
regions
of
the
world
may
become
even
as
paradise
itself
unto
the
most
holy
book
every
one
must
turn
and
all
that
is
not
expressly
recorded
therein
must
be
referred
to
the
universal
house
of
justice
that
which
this
body
whether
unanimously
or
by
a
majority
doth
carry
that
is
verily
the
truth
and
the
purpose
of
god
himself
whoso
doth
deviate
therefrom
is
verily
of
them
that
love
discord
hath
shown
forth
malice
and
turned
away
from
the
lord
of
the
covenant
even
at
the
present
time
the
bahá
ís
in
all
parts
of
the
world
maintain
an
intimate
and
cordial
association
by
means
of
regular
correspondence
and
individual
visits
this
contact
of
members
of
different
races
nationalities
and
religious
traditions
is
concrete
proof
that
the
burden
of
prejudice
and
the
historical
factors
of
division
can
be
entirely
overcome
through
the
spirit
of
oneness
established
by
bahá
u
lláh
the
world
order
of
bahá
u
lláh
the
larger
implications
of
this
order
are
explained
by
shoghi
effendi
in
successive
communications
addressed
to
the
bahá
í
community
since
february
i
can
not
refrain
from
appealing
to
them
who
stand
identified
with
the
faith
to
disregard
the
prevailing
notions
and
the
fleeting
fashions
of
the
day
and
to
realize
as
never
before
that
the
exploded
theories
and
the
tottering
institutions
of
civilization
must
needs
appear
in
sharp
contrast
with
those
institutions
which
are
destined
to
arise
upon
their
ruin
for
bahá
u
lláh
has
not
only
imbued
mankind
with
a
new
and
regenerating
spirit
he
has
not
merely
enunciated
certain
universal
principles
or
propounded
a
particular
philosophy
however
potent
sound
and
universal
these
may
be
in
addition
to
these
he
as
well
as
abdu
after
him
has
unlike
the
dispensations
of
the
past
clearly
and
specifically
laid
down
a
set
of
laws
established
definite
institutions
and
provided
for
the
essentials
of
a
divine
economy
these
are
destined
to
be
a
pattern
for
future
society
a
supreme
instrument
for
the
establishment
of
the
most
great
peace
and
the
one
agency
for
the
unification
of
the
world
and
the
proclamation
of
the
reign
of
righteousness
and
justice
upon
the
earth
unlike
the
dispensation
of
christ
unlike
the
dispensation
of
muḥammad
unlike
all
the
dispensations
of
the
past
the
apostles
of
bahá
u
lláh
in
every
land
wherever
they
labor
and
toil
have
before
them
in
clear
in
unequivocal
and
emphatic
language
all
the
laws
the
regulations
the
principles
the
institutions
the
guidance
they
require
for
the
prosecution
and
consummation
of
their
task
therein
lies
the
distinguishing
feature
of
the
bahá
í
revelation
therein
lies
the
strength
of
the
unity
of
the
faith
of
the
validity
of
a
revelation
that
claims
not
to
destroy
or
belittle
previous
revelations
but
to
connect
unify
and
fulfill
them
feeble
though
our
faith
may
now
appear
in
the
eyes
of
men
who
either
denounce
it
as
an
offshoot
of
islam
or
contemptuously
ignore
it
as
one
more
of
those
obscure
sects
that
abound
in
the
west
this
priceless
gem

indeed
are
the

who
in
utter

of

either
achieve

let

counsel
of

the
authorized
expounder

you
can

serve
your

was
abdu
s
rejoinder
to
a
high
official
in
the
service
of
the
federal
government
of
the
united
states
of
america
who
had
questioned
him
as
to
the
best
manner
in
which
he
could
promote
the
interests
of
his
government
and
people
if
you
strive
in
your
capacity
as
a
citizen
of
the
world
to
assist
in
the
eventual
application
of
the
principles
of
federalism
underlying
the
government
of
your
own
country
to
the
relationships
now
existing
between
the
peoples
and
nations
of
the
world
some
form
of
a
world
must
needs
be
evolved
in
whose
favor
all
the
nations
of
the
world
will
have
willingly
ceded
every
claim
to
make
war
certain
rights
to
impose
taxation
and
all
rights
to
maintain
armaments
except
for
purposes
of
maintaining
internal
order
within
their
respective
dominions
such
a
state
will
have
to
include
within
its
orbit
an
international
executive
adequate
to
enforce
supreme
and
unchallengeable
authority
on
every
recalcitrant
member
of
the
commonwealth
a
world
parliament
whose
members
shall
be
elected
by
the
people
in
their
respective
countries
and
whose
election
shall
be
confirmed
by
their
respective
governments
and
a
supreme
tribunal
whose
judgment
will
have
a
binding
effect
even
in
such
cases
where
the
parties
concerned
did
not
voluntarily
agree
to
submit
their
case
to
its
consideration
a
world
community
in
which
all
economic
barriers
will
have
been
permanently
demolished
and
the
interdependence
of
capital
and
labor
definitely
recognized
in
which
the
clamor
of
religious
fanaticism
and
strife
will
have
been
forever
stilled
in
which
the
flame
of
racial
animosity
will
have
been
finally
extinguished
in
which
a
single
code
of
international
product
of
the
considered
judgment
of
the
world
s
federated
have
as
its
sanction
the
instant
and
coercive
intervention
of
the
combined
forces
of
the
federated
units
and
finally
a
world
community
in
which
the
fury
of
a
capricious
and
militant
nationalism
will
have
been
transmuted
into
an
abiding
consciousness
of
world
indeed
appears
in
its
broadest
outline
the
order
anticipated
by
bahá
u
lláh
an
order
that
shall
come
to
be
regarded
as
the
fairest
fruit
of
a
slowly
maturing
age
let
there
be
no
misgivings
as
to
the
animating
purpose
of
the
law
of
bahá
u
lláh
far
from
aiming
at
the
subversion
of
the
existing
foundations
of
society
it
seeks
to
broaden
its
basis
to
remold
its
institutions
in
a
manner
consonant
with
the
needs
of
an
world
it
can
conflict
with
no
legitimate
allegiances
nor
can
it
undermine
essential
loyalties
its
purpose
is
neither
to
stifle
the
flame
of
a
sane
and
intelligent
patriotism
in
men
s
hearts
nor
to
abolish
the
system
of
national
autonomy
so
essential
if
the
evils
of
excessive
centralization
are
to
be
avoided
it
does
not
ignore
nor
does
it
attempt
to
suppress
the
diversity
of
ethnical
origins
of
climate
of
history
of
language
and
tradition
of
thought
and
habit
that
differentiate
the
peoples
and
nations
of
the
world
it
calls
for
a
wider
loyalty
for
a
larger
aspiration
than
any
that
has
animated
the
human
race
the
call
of
bahá
u
lláh
is
primarily
directed
against
all
forms
of
provincialism
all
insularities
and
prejudices
for
legal
standards
political
and
economic
theories
are
solely
designed
to
safeguard
the
interests
of
humanity
as
a
whole
and
not
humanity
to
be
crucified
for
the
preservation
of
the
integrity
of
any
particular
law
or
doctrine
the
principle
of
the
oneness
of
pivot
round
which
all
the
teachings
of
bahá
u
lláh
no
mere
outburst
of
ignorant
emotionalism
or
an
expression
of
vague
and
pious
hope
its
implications
are
deeper
its
claims
greater
than
any
which
the
prophets
of
old
were
allowed
to
advance
its
message
is
applicable
not
only
to
the
individual
but
concerns
itself
primarily
with
the
nature
of
those
essential
relationships
that
must
bind
all
the
states
and
nations
as
members
of
one
human
family
it
represents
the
consummation
of
human
evolution
that
the
forces
of
a
world
catastrophe
can
alone
precipitate
such
a
new
phase
of
human
thought
is
alas
becoming
increasingly
apparent
nothing
but
a
fiery
ordeal
out
of
which
humanity
will
emerge
chastened
and
prepared
can
succeed
in
implanting
that
sense
of
responsibility
which
the
leaders
of
a
newborn
age
must
arise
to
shoulder
has
not
abdu
himself
asserted
in
unequivocal
language
that
another
war
fiercer
than
the
last
will
assuredly
break
out
this
administrative
order
will
as
its
component
parts
its
organic
institutions
begin
to
function
with
efficiency
and
vigor
assert
its
claim
and
demonstrate
its
capacity
to
be
regarded
not
only
as
the
nucleus
but
the
very
pattern
of
the
new
world
order
destined
to
embrace
in
the
fullness
of
time
the
whole
of
mankind
alone
of
all
the
revelations
gone
before
it
this
faith
has
succeeded
in
raising
a
structure
which
the
bewildered
followers
of
bankrupt
and
broken
creeds
might
well
approach
and
critically
examine
and
seek
ere
it
is
too
late
the
invulnerable
security
of
its
shelter
to
what
else
if
not
the
power
and
majesty
which

both
in
theory
and

not

unique
in

can

no

to
conform

the
of
its
perfect
architect
has
fashioned
let
no
one
while
this
system
is
still
in
its
infancy
misconceive
its
character
belittle
its
significance
or
misrepresent
its
purpose
the
bedrock
on
which
this
administrative
order
is
founded
is
god
s
immutable
purpose
for
mankind
in
this
day
the
source
from
which
it
derives
its
inspiration
is
no
one
less
than
bahá
u
lláh
himself
the
central
the
underlying
aim
which
animates
it
is
the
establishment
of
the
new
world
order
as
adumbrated
by
bahá
u

the
methods
it
employs
the
standard
it
inculcates
incline
it
to
neither
east
nor
west
neither
jew
nor

neither
rich
nor

neither
white
nor

its
watchword
is
the
unification
of
the
human
race
its
standard
the
most
great
february
the
contrast
between
the
accumulating
evidences
of
steady
consolidation
that
accompany
the
rise
of
the
administrative

of
the
faith
of

and
the
forces
of
disintegration
which
batter
at
the
fabric
of
a
travailing
society
is
as
clear
as
it
is
arresting
both
within
and
outside
the
bahá

the
signs
and
tokens
which
in
a
mysterious
manner
are
heralding
the
birth
of
that
world
order
the
establishment
of
which
must
signalize
the
golden
age
of

be
rolled
up
and
a

the

should
be
regarded
as
signalizing
through
its
advent
the
coming
of
age
of
the
entire
human
race
it
should
be
viewed
not
merely
as
yet
another
spiritual
revival
in
the
fortunes
of
mankind
not
only
as
a
further
stage
in
a
chain
of
progressive
revelations
nor
even
as
the
culmination
of
one
of
a
series
of
recurrent
prophetic
cycles
but
rather
as
marking
the
last
and
highest
stage
in
the
stupendous
evolution
of
man
s
collective
life
on
this
planet
the
emergence
of
a
world
community
the
consciousness
of
world
citizenship
the
founding
of
a
world
civilization
and
culture
should
be
regarded
as
far
as
this
planetary
life
is
concerned
as
the
furthermost
limits
in
the
organization
of
human
society
though
man
as
an
individual
will
nay
must
indeed
as
a
result
of
such
a
consummation
continue
indefinitely
to
progress
and
develop
the
unity
of
the
human
race
as
envisaged
by
bahá

implies
the
establishment
of
a
world
commonwealth
in
which
all
nations
races

and
classes
are
closely
and
permanently
united
and
in

the
autonomy
of

and
the
personal
freedom
and
initiative
of
the
individuals
that
compose
them
are
definitely

completely
safeguarded
this
commonwealth
must
as
far
as
we
can
visualize
it
consist
of
a

will
as
the

ultimately
control
the

adjust
the

of
all

a

carry

arrived

enacted
by

safeguard
the

in
all

that
may
arise

a

a

the

upon

the

raises
all

its

that
for

the

by

the

has
been
preserved
from

from

together

the

infinitely

pronounced
as
in

of

ih
and
which
islám
fell
soon
after
the
death
of
muḥammad
was
the
first
legitimate
successor
of
the
prophet
and
that
only
his
descendants
are
the
rightful
caliphs
first
day
of
muharram
on
this
point
a
historian
remarks
the
belief
of
many
people
in
the
east
especially
the
believers
in
the
báb
now
bahá
ís
was
this
that
the
báb
received
no
education
but
that
the
mullás
in
order
to
lower
him
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
declared
that
such
knowledge
and
wisdom
as
he
possessed
were
accounted
for
by
the
education
he
had
received
after
deep
search
into
the
truth
of
this
matter
we
have
found
evidence
to
show
that
in
childhood
for
a
short
time
he
used
to
go
to
the
house
of
muḥammad
also
known
as
abid
where
he
was
taught
to
read
and
write
in
persian
it
was
this
to
which
the
báb
referred
when
he
wrote
in
the
book
of
bayán
o
muḥammad
o
my
teacher
the
remarkable
thing
is
this
however
that
this
who
was
his
teacher
became
a
devoted
disciple
of
his
own
pupil
and
the
uncle
of
the
báb
who
was
like
a
father
to
him
whose
name
was
ḥájí
siyyid
alí
also
became
a
devout
believer
and
was
martyred
as
a
bábí
the
understanding
of
these
mysteries
is
given
to
seekers
after
truth
but
we
know
this
that
such
education
as
the
báb
received
was
but
elementary
and
that
whatever
signs
of
unusual
greatness
and
knowledge
appeared
in
him
were
innate
and
from
a
traveller
s
narrative
written
to
illustrate
the
episode
of
the
báb
with
an
introduction
by
browne

of

ordained
successor
of

all

faithful
must
obey

persons
successively
held
the
office
of
imám
the
first
being
alí
the
cousin
and
of
the
prophet
the
majority
of
the

hold
that
the
twelfth
imám
called
by
them
the
imám
mihdí
disappeared
as
a
child
into
an
underground
passage
in
and
that
in

fullness
of

he
will
come
forth
overthrow
the
