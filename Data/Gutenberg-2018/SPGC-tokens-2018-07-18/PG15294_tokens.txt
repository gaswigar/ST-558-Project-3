again
i
the
last
mile
it
had
been
one
of
the
warm
and
almost
sultry
days
which
sometimes
come
in
november
a
maligned
month
which
is
really
an
epitome
of
the
other
eleven
or
a
sort
of
index
to
the
whole
year
changes
of
storm
and
sunshine
the
afternoon
was
like
spring
the
air
was
soft
and
damp
and
the
buds
of
the
willows
had
been
beguiled
into
swelling
a
little
so
that
there
was
a
bloom
over
them
and
the
grass
looked
as
if
it
had
been
growing
green
of
late
instead
of
fading
steadily
it
seemed
like
a
reprieve
from
the
doom
of
winter
or
from
even
november
itself
the
dense
and
early
darkness
which
usually
follows
such
unseasonable
mildness
had
already
begun
to
cut
short
the
pleasures
of
this
day
when
a
young
woman
who
carried
a
child
in
her
arms
turned
from
a
main
road
of
oldfields
into
a
which
led
southward
across
the
fields
and
pastures
she
seemed
sure
of
her
way
and
kept
the
path
without
difficulty
though
a
stranger
might
easily
have
lost
it
here
and
there
where
it
led
among
the
patches
of
or
bayberry
bushes
or
through
shadowy
tracts
of
small
she
stopped
sometimes
to
rest
and
walked
more
and
more
wearily
with
increasing
effort
but
she
kept
on
her
way
desperately
as
if
it
would
not
do
to
arrive
much
later
at
the
place
which
she
was
seeking
the
child
seemed
to
be
asleep
it
looked
too
heavy
for
so
slight
a
woman
to
carry
the
path
led
after
a
while
to
a
more
open
country
there
was
a
low
hill
to
be
climbed
and
at
its
top
the
slender
figure
stopped
and
seemed
to
be
panting
for
breath
a
follower
might
have
noticed
that
it
bent
its
head
over
the
child
for
a
moment
as
it
stood
dark
against
the
darkening
sky
there
had
formerly
been
a
defense
against
the
indians
on
this
hill
which
in
the
daytime
commanded
a
fine
view
of
the
surrounding
country
and
the
low
earthworks
or
foundations
of
the
garrison
were
still
plainly
to
be
seen
the
woman
seated
herself
on
the
sunken
wall
in
spite
of
the
dampness
and
increasing
chill
still
holding
the
child
and
rocking
to
and
fro
like
one
in
despair
the
child
waked
and
began
to
whine
and
cry
a
little
in
that
strange
lonely
place
and
after
a
few
minutes
perhaps
to
quiet
it
they
went
on
their
way
near
the
foot
of
the
hill
was
a
brook
swollen
by
the
autumn
rains
it
made
a
loud
noise
in
the
quiet
pasture
as
if
it
were
crying
out
against
a
wrong
or
some
sad
memory
the
woman
went
toward
it
at
first
following
a
slight
ridge
which
was
all
that
remained
of
a
covered
path
which
had
led
down
from
the
garrison
to
the
spring
below
at
the
brookside
if
she
had
meant
to
quench
her
thirst
here
she
changed
her
mind
and
suddenly
turned
to
the
right
following
the
brook
a
short
distance
and
then
going
straight
toward
the
river
itself
and
the
high
uplands
which
by
daylight
were
smooth
pastures
with
here
and
there
a
tangled
or
the
grassy
cellar
of
a
long
vanished
it
was
night
now
it
was
too
late
in
the
year
for
the
chirp
of
any
insects
the
moving
air
which
could
hardly
be
called
wind
swept
over
in
slow
waves
and
a
few
dry
leaves
rustled
on
an
old
hawthorn
tree
which
grew
beside
the
hollow
where
a
house
had
been
and
a
low
sound
came
from
the
river
the
whole
country
side
seemed
asleep
in
the
darkness
but
the
lonely
woman
felt
no
lack
of
companionship
it
was
well
suited
to
her
own
mood
that
the
world
slept
and
said
nothing
to
her
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
the
only
creature
alive
a
little
this
side
of
the
river
shore
there
was
an
old
burial
place
a
primitive
spot
enough
where
the
graves
were
only
marked
by
rough
stones
and
the
short
grass
was
spread
over
departed
generations
of
the
farmers
and
their
wives
and
children
by
day
it
was
in
sight
of
the
pine
woods
and
the
moving
water
and
nothing
hid
it
from
the
great
sky
overhead
but
now
it
was
like
a
prison
walled
about
by
the
barriers
of
night
however
eagerly
the
woman
had
hurried
to
this
place
and
with
what
purpose
she
may
have
sought
the
river
bank
when
she
recognized
her
surroundings
she
stopped
for
a
moment
swaying
and
irresolute
no
no
sighed
the
child
plaintively
and
she
shuddered
and
started
forward
then
as
her
feet
stumbled
among
the
graves
she
turned
and
fled
it
no
longer
seemed
solitary
but
as
if
a
legion
of
ghosts
which
had
been
wandering
under
cover
of
the
dark
had
discovered
this
intruder
and
were
chasing
her
and
flocking
around
her
and
oppressing
her
from
every
side
and
as
she
caught
sight
of
a
light
in
a
farmhouse
window
a
light
which
had
been
shining
after
her
all
the
way
down
to
the
river
she
tried
to
hurry
toward
it
the
unnatural
strength
of
terror
urged
her
on
she
retraced
her
steps
like
some
pursued
animal
she
remembered
one
after
another
the
fearful
stories
she
had
known
of
that
ancient
neighborhood
the
child
cried
but
she
could
not
answer
it
she
fell
again
and
again
and
at
last
all
her
strength
seemed
to
fail
her
her
feet
refused
to
carry
her
farther
and
she
crept
painfully
a
few
yards
at
a
time
slowly
along
the
ground
the
fear
of
her
superhuman
enemies
had
forsaken
her
and
her
only
desire
was
to
reach
the
light
that
shone
from
the
looming
shadow
of
the
house
at
last
she
was
close
to
it
at
last
she
gave
one
great
sigh
and
the
child
fell
from
her
grasp
at
last
she
clutched
the
edge
of
the
worn
doorstep
with
both
hands
and
lay
still
ii
the
kitchen
indoors
there
was
a
cheerful
company
the
mildness
of
the
evening
had
enticed
two
neighbors
of
thacher
the
mistress
of
the
house
into
taking
their
walks
abroad
and
so
with
their
heads
well
protected
by
large
gingham
handkerchiefs
they
had
stepped
along
the
road
and
up
the
lane
to
spend
a
social
hour
or
two
john
thacher
their
old
neighbor
son
was
known
to
be
away
serving
on
a
jury
in
the
county
town
and
they
thought
it
likely
that
his
mother
would
enjoy
company
their
own
houses
stood
side
by
side
jacob
dyer
and
martin
dyer
were
their
names
and
excellent
women
they
were
their
husbands
were
curiously
alike
and
amazingly
fond
of
each
other
though
either
would
have
scorned
to
make
any
special
outward
demonstration
of
it
they
were
spending
the
evening
together
in
brother
martin
house
and
were
talking
over
the
purchase
of
a
bit
of
woodland
and
the
profit
of
clearing
it
when
their
wives
had
left
them
without
any
apology
to
visit
thacher
as
we
have
already
seen
this
was
the
nearest
house
and
only
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
and
when
they
opened
the
door
they
had
found
thacher
spinning
i
must
own
up
i
am
glad
to
see
you
common
she
said
i
do
feel
scary
at
being
left
sole
alone
it
ai
that
but
i
have
been
getting
through
with
a
lonesome
spell
of
another
kind
john
he
does
as
well
as
a
man
can
but
here
i
be
here
i
be
and
the
good
woman
could
say
no
more
while
her
guests
understood
readily
enough
the
sorrow
that
had
found
no
words
i
suppose
you
have
got
no
news
from
asked
martin
bluntly
we
was
speaking
of
her
as
we
come
along
and
saying
it
seemed
to
be
a
pity
she
feel
it
was
best
to
come
back
this
winter
and
help
you
through
only
one
daughter
and
left
alone
as
you
be
with
the
bad
spells
you
are
liable
to
in
winter
time
but
there
it
ai
her
way
her
ambitions
ai
what
they
should
be
that
all
i
can
say
if
she
got
a
gift
for
anything
special
now
continued
jake
we
should
feel
it
was
different
and
want
her
to
have
a
chance
but
she
just
like
other
folks
for
all
she
felt
so
much
above
farming
i
do
see
as
she
can
do
better
than
come
back
to
the
old
place
or
leastways
to
the
village
and
fetch
up
the
little
gal
to
be
some
use
she
might
dressmake
or
do
millinery
work
she
always
had
a
pretty
taste
and
would
be
better
than
roving
i
would
hurt
her
pride
but
thacher
flushed
at
this
and
martin
came
to
the
rescue
you
think
we
job
comforters
cried
the
good
soul
hastily
but
there
mis
thacher
you
know
we
feel
as
if
she
was
our
own
there
ai
nothing
i
would
do
for
sick
or
well
and
i
declare
i
believe
she
pull
through
yet
and
make
a
piece
of
luck
that
set
us
all
to
work
praising
of
her
she
like
to
marry
again
for
all
i
can
see
with
her
good
looks
folks
always
has
their
joys
and
calamities
as
they
go
through
the
world
thacher
shook
her
head
two
or
three
times
with
a
dismal
expression
and
made
no
answer
she
had
pushed
back
the
droning
which
she
had
been
using
and
had
taken
her
knitting
from
the
shelf
by
the
clock
and
seated
herself
contentedly
while
jake
and
martin
had
each
produced
a
blue
yarn
stocking
from
a
capacious
pocket
and
the
shining
steel
needles
were
presently
all
clicking
together
one
knitter
after
another
would
sheathe
the
spare
needle
under
her
apron
strings
while
they
asked
each
other
advice
from
time
to
time
about
the
propriety
of
narrerin
or
whether
it
were
not
best
to
widden
according
to
the
progress
their
respective
stockings
had
made
thacher
had
lighted
an
extra
candle
and
replenished
the
fire
for
the
air
was
chillier
since
the
sun
went
down
they
were
all
sure
of
a
coming
change
of
weather
and
counted
various
signs
thacher
lowness
of
spirits
among
the
number
while
all
three
described
various
minor
maladies
from
which
they
had
suffered
during
the
day
and
of
which
the
unseasonable
weather
was
guilty
i
ca
get
over
the
feeling
that
we
are
watchin
with
somebody
said
martin
after
a
while
moved
by
some
strange
impulse
and
looking
over
her
shoulder
at
which
remark
thacher
glanced
up
anxiously
something
has
been
hanging
over
me
all
day
said
she
simply
and
at
this
the
needles
clicked
faster
than
ever
we
been
taking
rather
a
low
range
suggested
jake
we
shall
get
to
telling
over
ghost
stories
if
we
do
look
out
and
i
for
one
shall
be
to
go
home
by
the
way
i
suppose
you
have
heard
about
old
billy
dow
experience
night
afore
last
thacher
john
being
away
i
ai
had
nobody
to
fetch
me
the
news
these
few
days
past
said
the
hostess
why
what
happened
to
billy
now
the
two
women
looked
at
each
other
he
was
getting
himself
home
as
best
he
could
he
owned
up
to
having
made
a
lively
evenin
of
it
and
i
expect
he
was
wandering
all
over
the
road
and
did
know
nothin
except
that
he
was
towards
home
an
he
stepped
off
from
the
high
bank
this
side
o
dunnell
and
rolled
down
over
and
over
and
when
he
come
to
there
was
a
great
white
creatur
over
him
and
he
thought
was
a
ghost
was
higher
up
on
the
bank
than
him
and
it
kind
of
moved
along
down
if
was
coming
right
on
to
him
and
he
got
on
to
his
knees
and
begun
to
say
his
ten
commandments
fast
he
could
rattle
out
he
got
mixed
up
and
when
the
boys
heard
his
teeth
they
began
to
laugh
and
he
up
an
cleared
dunnell
boys
had
been
down
the
road
a
piece
and
was
just
coming
home
an
was
their
old
white
hoss
that
had
got
out
of
the
barn
it
bein
such
a
mild
night
an
was
wandering
off
they
said
to
billy
everybody
could
lay
a
ghost
so
quick
as
he
could
and
they
did
he
had
the
means
so
handy
the
three
friends
laughed
but
thacher
face
quickly
lost
its
smile
and
took
back
its
worried
look
she
evidently
was
in
no
mood
for
joking
poor
billy
said
she
he
was
called
the
smartest
boy
in
school
i
that
one
of
the
teachers
urged
his
folks
to
let
him
go
to
college
but
no
use
they
had
the
money
and
could
get
it
and
in
him
to
work
his
way
as
some
do
got
a
master
head
for
figur
folks
used
to
get
him
to
post
books
you
know
but
he
past
that
now
creatur
as
ever
stept
but
he
always
was
afeard
of
the
dark
if
i
could
see
him
there
and
the
old
white
hoss
shakin
his
head
and
she
laughed
again
but
quickly
stopped
herself
and
looked
over
her
shoulder
at
the
window
would
ye
like
the
curtain
drawed
asked
jake
but
thacher
shook
her
head
silently
while
the
gray
cat
climbed
up
into
her
lap
and
laid
down
in
a
round
ball
to
sleep
she
a
proper
cosset
ai
she
inquired
martin
approvingly
while
jake
asked
about
the
candles
which
gave
a
clear
light
be
they
the
last
you
run
she
inquired
but
was
answered
to
the
contrary
and
a
brisk
conversation
followed
upon
the
proper
proportions
of
tallow
and
bayberry
wax
and
the
dangers
of
the
oils
which
the
village
were
attempting
to
introduce
sperm
oil
was
growing
more
and
more
dear
in
price
and
worthless
in
quality
and
the
lamps
were
reported
to
be
past
their
usefulness
i
must
own
i
set
most
by
good
candle
light
said
martin
is
no
expense
to
speak
of
where
you
raise
the
taller
and
it
cheerful
and
bright
in
winter
time
in
old
times
when
the
houses
were
draftier
they
was
troublesome
about
flickering
candles
was
but
land
think
how
comfortable
we
live
now
to
what
we
used
to
stoves
is
such
a
convenience
the
fire
so
much
handier
housekeepin
do
begin
to
be
the
trial
it
was
once
i
must
say
i
like
cookin
better
than
oven
cookin
observed
jake
seems
to
me
if
the
taste
of
things
was
all
drawed
up
chimbly
be
you
going
to
do
much
for
thanksgivin
thacher
i
not
and
moved
by
a
sudden
kind
impulse
she
added
why
ca
you
and
john
jine
with
our
folks
would
put
us
out
and
be
lonesome
for
ye
wo
be
no
lonesomer
than
last
year
was
nor
the
year
before
and
thacher
face
quivered
a
little
as
she
rose
and
took
one
of
the
candles
and
opened
the
trap
door
that
covered
the
cellar
stairs
now
do
ye
go
to
makin
yourself
work
cried
the
guests
no
do
we
ai
needin
nothin
we
was
late
about
supper
but
their
hostess
stepped
carefully
down
and
disappeared
for
a
few
minutes
while
the
cat
hovered
anxiously
at
the
edge
of
the
black
pit
i
forgot
to
ask
ye
if
ye
have
some
cider
a
sepulchral
voice
asked
presently
but
i
do
know
now
i
can
get
at
it
i
told
john
i
should
want
any
whilst
he
was
away
and
so
he
ai
got
the
spiggit
in
yet
to
which
jake
and
martin
both
replied
that
they
were
no
hands
for
that
drink
unless
was
a
drop
right
from
the
press
or
a
taste
o
good
hard
cider
towards
the
spring
of
the
year
and
thacher
soon
returned
with
some
slices
of
cake
in
a
plate
and
some
apples
held
in
her
apron
one
of
her
neighbors
took
the
candle
as
she
reached
up
to
put
it
on
the
floor
and
when
the
trap
door
was
closed
again
all
three
drew
up
to
the
table
and
had
a
little
feast
the
cake
was
of
a
kind
peculiar
to
its
maker
who
prided
herself
upon
never
being
without
it
and
there
was
some
trick
of
her
hand
or
a
secret
ingredient
which
was
withheld
when
she
responded
with
apparent
cheerfulness
to
requests
for
its
recipe
as
for
the
apples
they
were
grown
upon
an
old
tree
one
of
whose
limbs
had
been
grafted
with
some
unknown
variety
of
fruit
so
long
ago
that
the
history
was
forgotten
only
that
an
english
gardener
many
years
before
had
brought
some
cuttings
from
the
old
country
and
one
of
them
had
somehow
come
into
the
possession
of
john
thacher
grandfather
when
grafted
fruit
was
a
thing
to
be
treasured
and
jealously
guarded
it
had
been
told
that
when
the
elder
thacher
had
given
away
cuttings
he
had
always
stolen
to
the
orchards
in
the
night
afterward
and
ruined
them
however
when
the
family
had
grown
more
generous
in
later
years
it
had
seemed
to
be
without
avail
for
on
their
neighbors
trees
or
their
own
the
english
apples
had
proved
worthless
whether
it
were
some
favoring
quality
in
that
spot
of
soil
or
in
the
sturdy
old
native
tree
itself
the
rich
golden
apples
had
grown
there
year
after
year
in
perfection
but
nowhere
else
there
ai
no
such
apples
as
these
to
my
mind
said
martin
as
she
polished
a
large
one
with
her
apron
and
held
it
up
to
the
light
and
jake
murmured
assent
having
already
taken
a
sufficient
first
bite
there
only
one
little
bough
that
bears
any
great
said
thacher
but
it
come
to
that
once
before
and
another
branch
has
shot
up
and
been
likely
as
if
it
was
a
young
tree
the
good
souls
sat
comfortably
in
their
chairs
and
enjoyed
this
mild
attempt
at
a
festival
thacher
even
grew
cheerful
and
responsive
for
her
guests
seemed
so
and
free
from
care
that
the
sunshine
of
their
presence
warmed
her
own
chilled
and
fearful
heart
they
embarked
upon
a
wide
sea
of
neighborhood
gossip
and
parish
opinions
and
at
last
some
one
happened
to
speak
again
of
thanksgiving
which
at
once
turned
the
tide
of
conversation
and
it
seemed
to
ebb
suddenly
while
the
gray
dreary
look
once
more
overspread
thacher
face
i
do
see
why
you
wo
keep
with
our
folks
this
year
you
and
john
once
more
suggested
martin
ai
wuth
while
to
be
making
yourselves
dismal
here
to
home
the
day
be
lonesome
for
you
at
best
and
you
shall
have
whatever
we
got
and
welcome
wo
be
lonesomer
this
year
than
it
was
last
nor
the
year
before
that
and
we
stood
it
somehow
or
answered
thacher
for
the
second
time
while
she
rose
to
put
more
wood
in
the
stove
seems
to
me
is
growing
cold
i
felt
a
draught
acrost
my
shoulders
these
nights
is
dreadful
chill
you
feel
the
damp
right
through
your
bones
i
never
saw
it
darker
than
was
last
evenin
i
thought
it
seemed
kind
o
stived
up
here
in
the
kitchen
and
i
opened
the
door
and
looked
out
and
i
declare
i
could
see
my
hand
before
me
it
always
kind
of
scares
me
these
black
nights
said
jake
dyer
i
expect
something
to
clutch
at
me
every
minute
and
i
feel
as
if
some
sort
of
a
creatur
was
travelin
right
behind
me
when
i
am
out
door
in
the
dark
it
makes
it
bad
havin
a
wanin
moon
just
now
when
the
fogs
hangs
so
low
it
seems
to
me
as
if
was
darker
when
she
rises
late
towards
mornin
than
when
she
gone
altogether
i
know
is
i
once
thacher
resumed
when
was
a
baby
and
john
was
just
turned
four
year
old
their
father
had
gone
down
river
in
the
packet
and
i
was
expectin
on
him
home
at
supper
time
but
he
did
come
was
late
in
the
fall
and
a
black
night
as
i
ever
see
was
taken
with
something
like
croup
and
i
had
an
end
candle
in
the
candlestick
that
i
lighted
and
long
afore
it
was
burnt
down
and
i
went
down
cellar
to
the
box
where
i
kep
and
if
you
will
believe
it
the
rats
had
got
to
it
and
there
was
a
week
o
one
left
i
was
near
out
anyway
we
did
have
this
then
and
i
i
could
make
up
a
good
lively
blaze
so
i
come
up
full
o
scold
as
i
could
be
and
then
i
found
i
burnt
up
all
my
dry
wood
you
see
i
thought
certain
he
be
home
and
i
was
tendin
to
the
but
i
started
to
go
out
o
the
door
and
found
it
had
come
on
to
rain
hard
and
i
said
to
myself
i
would
go
out
to
the
woodpile
and
get
my
clothes
all
damp
o
and
the
candle
end
would
last
a
spell
longer
and
he
be
home
by
that
time
i
had
a
least
o
suspicion
but
what
he
was
dallying
round
up
to
the
corners
o
the
rest
o
the
men
bein
was
saturday
night
and
i
was
some
put
out
about
it
for
he
knew
the
baby
was
sick
and
i
had
nobody
with
me
i
set
down
and
waited
but
he
never
come
and
it
rained
hard
as
i
ever
see
it
and
i
left
his
supper
standin
right
in
the
floor
and
then
i
begun
to
be
distressed
for
fear
somethin
had
happened
to
and
i
set
to
work
and
cried
and
the
candle
end
give
a
flare
and
went
out
and
by
by
the
fire
begun
to
get
low
and
i
took
the
and
went
to
bed
to
keep
warm
was
an
awful
cold
night
considerin
was
such
a
heavy
rain
and
there
i
laid
awake
and
thought
i
heard
things
steppin
about
the
room
and
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
was
a
week
long
before
mornin
come
and
as
if
i
got
to
be
an
old
woman
i
did
go
through
with
everything
that
night
was
that
time
broke
his
leg
you
know
they
was
takin
a
deck
load
of
oak
knees
down
by
the
packet
and
one
on
rolled
down
from
the
top
of
the
pile
and
struck
him
just
below
the
knee
he
was
poling
for
there
wa
a
breath
o
wind
and
he
always
felt
certain
there
was
somethin
mysterious
about
it
he
had
a
good
deal
worse
knocks
than
that
seemed
to
be
as
only
left
a
black
and
blue
spot
and
he
said
he
never
see
a
deck
load
o
timber
piled
securer
he
had
some
queer
notions
about
the
doin
o
sperits
had
his
old
aunt
parser
was
to
blame
for
it
she
lived
with
his
father
folks
and
used
to
fill
him
and
the
rest
o
the
with
all
sorts
o
ghost
stories
and
stuff
i
used
to
tell
him
she
a
hung
for
a
witch
if
lived
in
them
old
salem
days
he
always
used
to
be
tellin
what
everything
was
the
sign
of
when
we
was
first
married
till
i
laughed
him
out
of
it
it
made
me
kind
of
notional
there
too
much
now
we
ca
make
sense
of
without
addin
to
it
out
o
our
own
heads
jake
and
martin
were
quite
familiar
with
the
story
of
the
night
when
there
were
no
candles
and
thacher
had
broken
his
leg
having
been
present
themselves
early
in
the
morning
afterward
but
they
had
listened
with
none
the
less
interest
these
country
neighbors
knew
their
friends
affairs
as
well
as
they
did
their
own
but
such
an
audience
is
never
impatient
the
repetitions
of
the
best
stories
are
signal
events
for
ordinary
circumstances
do
not
inspire
them
affairs
must
rise
to
a
certain
level
before
a
narration
of
some
great
crisis
is
suggested
and
exactly
as
a
city
audience
is
well
contented
with
hearing
the
plays
of
shakespeare
over
and
over
again
so
each
man
and
woman
of
experience
is
permitted
to
deploy
their
but
always
interesting
stories
upon
the
rustic
stage
i
must
say
i
ca
to
hear
anything
about
ghosts
after
sundown
observed
jake
who
was
at
times
somewhat
troubled
by
what
she
and
her
friends
designated
as
narves
i
believe
in
it
something
creepy
common
but
after
dark
it
scares
me
to
pieces
i
do
know
but
i
shall
be
afeared
to
go
home
and
she
laughed
uneasily
there
when
i
get
through
with
this
needle
i
believe
i
wo
knit
no
more
the
back
o
my
neck
is
all
numb
do
talk
o
goin
home
yet
awhile
said
the
hostess
looking
up
quickly
as
if
she
hated
the
thought
of
being
left
alone
again
is
just
on
the
edge
of
the
evenin
the
nights
is
so
long
now
we
think
it
bedtime
half
an
hour
after
we
got
lit
up
was
a
good
lift
havin
you
step
over
i
was
really
to
set
here
by
myself
and
for
some
minutes
nobody
spoke
and
the
needles
clicked
faster
than
ever
suddenly
there
was
a
strange
sound
outside
the
door
and
they
stared
at
each
other
in
terror
and
held
their
breath
but
nobody
stirred
this
was
no
familiar
footstep
presently
they
heard
a
strange
little
cry
and
still
they
feared
to
look
or
to
know
what
was
waiting
outside
then
thacher
took
a
candle
in
her
hand
and
still
hesitating
asked
once
who
is
there
and
hearing
no
answer
slowly
opened
the
door
iii
at
jake
and
in
the
mean
time
the
evening
had
been
much
enjoyed
by
the
brothers
who
were
spending
it
together
in
martin
dyer
kitchen
the
houses
stood
side
by
side
but
jacob
dyer
youngest
daughter
the
only
one
now
left
at
home
was
receiving
a
visit
from
her
lover
or
as
the
family
expressed
it
the
young
man
who
was
keeping
company
with
her
and
her
father
mindful
of
his
own
youth
had
kindly
withdrawn
martin
children
were
already
established
in
homes
of
their
own
with
the
exception
of
one
daughter
who
was
at
work
in
one
of
the
cotton
factories
at
lowell
in
company
with
several
of
her
acquaintances
it
has
already
been
said
that
jake
and
martin
liked
nobody
company
so
well
as
their
own
their
wives
had
a
joke
about
being
comparatively
unnecessary
to
their
respective
partners
and
indeed
the
two
men
had
a
curiously
dependent
feeling
toward
each
other
it
was
the
close
sympathy
which
twins
sometimes
have
each
to
each
and
had
become
a
byword
among
all
their
acquaintances
they
were
seldom
individualized
in
any
way
and
neither
was
able
to
distinguish
himself
apparently
for
one
always
heard
of
the
family
as
jake
and
martin
folks
and
of
their
possessions
from
least
to
greatest
as
belonging
to
both
brothers
the
only
time
they
had
ever
been
separated
was
once
in
their
early
youth
when
jake
had
been
fired
with
a
desire
to
go
to
sea
but
he
deserted
the
coastwise
schooner
in
the
first
port
and
came
home
because
he
could
not
bear
it
any
longer
without
his
brother
martin
had
no
turn
for
seafaring
so
jake
remained
ashore
and
patiently
made
a
farmer
of
himself
for
love
sake
and
in
spite
of
a
great
thirst
for
adventure
that
had
never
ceased
to
fever
his
blood
it
was
astonishing
how
much
they
found
to
say
to
each
other
when
one
considers
that
their
experiences
were
almost
constantly
the
same
but
nothing
contented
them
better
than
an
uninterrupted
evening
spent
in
each
other
society
and
as
they
hoed
corn
or
dug
potatoes
or
mowed
or
as
they
drove
to
the
corners
sitting
stiffly
upright
in
the
wagon
they
were
always
to
be
seen
talking
as
if
it
were
the
first
meeting
after
a
long
separation
but
having
taken
these
quiet
times
for
the
discussion
of
all
possible
and
impossible
problems
they
were
men
of
fixed
opinions
and
were
ready
at
a
moment
warning
to
render
exact
decisions
they
were
not
fond
of
society
as
a
rule
they
found
little
occasion
for
much
talk
with
their
neighbors
but
used
as
few
words
as
possible
nobody
was
more
respected
than
the
brothers
it
was
often
said
of
them
that
their
word
was
their
bond
and
as
they
passed
from
youth
to
middle
age
and
in
these
days
were
growing
to
look
like
elderly
men
they
were
free
from
shame
or
reproach
though
not
from
much
joking
and
friendly
fun
their
farm
had
been
owned
in
the
family
since
the
settlement
of
the
country
and
the
house
which
martin
occupied
was
very
old
jake
had
been
built
for
him
when
he
was
married
from
timber
cut
in
their
own
woodlands
and
after
thirty
years
of
wear
it
looked
scarcely
newer
than
its
companion
and
when
it
is
explained
that
they
had
married
sisters
because
as
people
said
they
even
went
courting
together
it
will
be
easy
to
see
that
they
had
found
life
more
harmonious
than
most
people
do
sometimes
the
wife
of
one
brother
would
complain
that
her
sister
enjoyed
undue
advantages
and
profits
from
the
estate
but
there
was
rarely
any
disagreement
and
jake
was
mistress
of
the
turkeys
and
martin
held
sway
over
the
hens
while
they
divided
the
spoils
amiably
at
thanksgiving
time
when
the
geese
were
sold
if
it
were
a
bad
year
for
turkeys
and
the
tender
young
were
chilled
in
the
wet
grass
while
the
hens
flourished
steadily
the
season
through
jake
spirits
drooped
and
she
became
envious
of
the
good
fortune
which
flaunted
itself
before
her
eyes
but
on
the
whole
they
suffered
and
enjoyed
together
and
found
no
fault
with
their
destinies
the
two
wives
though
the
affection
between
them
was
of
an
ordinary
sort
were
apt
to
form
a
league
against
the
brothers
and
this
prevented
a
more
troublesome
rivalry
which
might
have
existed
between
the
households
jake
and
martin
were
particularly
enjoying
the
evening
some
accident
had
befallen
the
which
the
brothers
had
never
more
than
half
approved
it
being
one
of
the
early
patterns
and
a
poor
exchange
for
the
ancient
methods
of
cookery
in
the
wide
fireplace
the
women
had
had
a
natural
desire
to
be
equal
with
their
neighbors
and
knew
better
than
their
husbands
did
the
difference
this
useful
invention
had
made
in
their
work
however
this
one
night
the
conservative
brothers
could
take
a
mild
revenge
and
when
their
wives
were
well
on
their
way
to
thacher
they
had
assured
each
other
that
if
the
plaguey
thing
were
to
be
carried
to
the
corners
in
the
morning
to
be
exchanged
or
repaired
it
would
be
as
well
to
have
it
in
readiness
and
had
quickly
taken
down
its
pipes
and
lifted
it
as
if
it
were
a
feather
to
the
neighboring
woodshed
then
they
hastily
pried
away
a
fireboard
which
closed
the
great
fireplace
and
looked
smilingly
upon
the
crane
and
its
pothooks
and
the
familiar
iron
dogs
which
had
been
imprisoned
there
in
darkness
for
many
months
they
brought
in
the
materials
for
an
fire
backlog
forestick
and
crowsticks
and
presently
seated
themselves
before
a
crackling
blaze
martin
brought
a
tall
brown
pitcher
of
cider
from
the
cellar
and
set
two
mugs
beside
it
on
the
small
table
and
for
some
little
time
they
enjoyed
themselves
in
silence
after
which
jake
remarked
that
he
did
know
but
they
got
full
enough
of
a
fire
for
such
a
mild
night
but
he
wished
his
own
stove
and
the
new
one
too
could
be
dropped
into
the
river
for
good
and
all
they
put
the
jug
of
cider
between
the
andirons
and
then
moved
by
a
common
impulse
drew
their
chairs
a
little
farther
from
the
mounting
flames
before
they
quenched
their
thirst
from
the
mugs
i
call
that
pretty
cider
said
martin
is
young
yet
but
it
has
got
some
weight
and
is
smooth
there
a
sight
difference
between
good
upland
fruit

jacob

took
into
consideration
git
your
apples
just
in
the
right
time
not
too
early
to

nor
too
late
to

o
the
ground
and
just
in
the
snap
o
time
as
to
ripeness
on
a
good
sharp
day
with
the
sun
have
into
the
press
and
what
comes
out
is
i
think
if
we
had
any
fault
in
years
past
was
puttin
off
makin
a
little
too
late
but
i
do
see
as
this
could
be
beat
i
do
know
you
feel
like
a
pipe
but
i
believe
i
light
up
and
thereupon
a
good
portion
of
tobacco
was
cut
and
made
fine
in
each
of
the
hard
left
hands
and
presently
the
clay
pipes
were
touched
off
with
a
live
coal
and
great
clouds
of
smoke
might
have
been
seen
to
disappear
under
the
edge
of
the
drawn
quickly
up
the
chimney
by
the
draft
of
the
blazing
fire
jacob
pushed
back
his
chair
another
foot
or
two
and
martin
soon
followed
mentioning
that
it
was
getting
hot
but
it
was
well
to
keep
out
the
damp
what
set
the
women
out
to
go
traipsin
up
to
thacher
folks
inquired
jacob
holding
his
cider
mug
with
one
hand
and
drumming
it
with
the
finger
ends
of
the
other
i
had
an
idee
that
they
wanted
to
find
out
if
anything
had
been
heard
about
getting
home
for
thanksgiving
answered
martin
turning
to
look
shrewdly
at
his
brother
women
folks
does
suffer
if
there
anything
goin
on
they
ca
find
out
about
said
she
was
going
to
invite
mis
thacher
and
john
to
eat
a
piece
o
our
big
turkey
but
she
did
they
want
to
leave
curi
about
ai
it
i
expected
when
her
husband
died
she
be
right
back
here
with
what
she
got
at
any
rate
till
she
raised
the
child
to
some
size
there
be
no
expense
here
to
what
she
have
elsewhere
and
here
her
beginnin
to
age
she
ca
do
what
she
used
to
john
was
tellin
of
me
and
i
do
doubt
worn
upon
her
folks
thinks
i
do
lay
no
great
belief
that
john
get
home
from
court
said
jacob
dyer
they
say
that
court
goin
to
set
till
christmas
maybe
there
an
awful
string
o
cases
on
the
docket
oh
was
you
told
me
it
most
like
they
let
up
for
a
couple
o
days
for
thanksgivin
but
john
might
was
wuth
his
while
to
travel
here
and
back
again
he
had
something
to
do
before
winter
shets
down
perhaps
they
prevail
upon
the
old
lady
i
wish
they
would
i
sure
but
an
only
daughter
forsakin
her
so
was
most
too
bad
of
she
had
dreadful
high
notions
when
she
no
a
baby
and
good
conscience
how
she
liked
to
rig
up
when
she
first
used
to
come
back
from
lowell
better
ha
put
her
money
out
to
interest
i
believe
in
young
folks
makin
all
they
can
o
theirselves
announced
martin
puffing
hard
at
his
pipe
and
drawing
a
little
farther
still
from
the
fireplace
because
the
scorching
red
coals
had
begun
to
drop
beneath
the
forestick
i
give
my
the
best
push
forrard
i
could
an
you
done
the
same
had
a
dreadful
cravin
to
be
somethin
common
but
it
do
look
as
if
she
was
goin
to
make
out
any
great
was
unfortunate
her
losin
of
her
husband
but
i
you
heard
hints
that
they
none
too
she
a
done
better
to
have
worked
on
a
while
to
lowell
and
got
forehanded
and
then
married
some
likely
young
fellow
and
settled
down
here
or
to
the
corners
if
she
did
want
to
farm
it
there
was
jim
hall
used
to
be
hanging
round
and
she
been
full
as
well
off
if
she
took
him
too
ai
no
use
for
folks
to
marry
one
that
of
another
kind
and
belongs
different
it
like
two
fiddles
that
plays
different
tunes
you
ca
make
nothin
o
no
matter
if
both
on
em
trying
their
best
one
on
beats
the
other
down
entirely
and
has
all
the
say
and
ginerally
is
the
worst
one
does
it
husband
nothin
to
boast
of
from
all
we
can
gather
but
they
did
think
alike
about
nothin
she
could
done
well
with
him
if
there
been
more
of
i
do
marvel
his
folks
felt
bad
did
act
right
by
nor
they
by
her
said
the
twin
brother
i
tell
ye
would
have
done
credit
if
she
been
let
i
seem
to
think
was
with
her
when
she
was
there
to
work
in
the
shop
she
thought
would
be
smart
to
marry
him
and
then
she
be
a
lady
for
good
and
all
and
all
there
was
of
it
she
found
his
folks
felt
put
out
and
hurt
and
instead
of
pleasing
up
and
doing
the
best
she
could
she
know
no
better
than
to
aggravate
she
was
wrong
there
but
i
hold
to
it
that
if
they
pleased
her
up
a
little
and
done
well
by
her
she
ha
bloomed
out
and
fell
right
in
with
their
ways
she
got
outward
ambitions
enough
but
i
view
it
she
was
all
a
part
of
his
foolishness
to
them
i
dare
say
they
give
her
the
blame
o
the
whole
o
ought
to
had
the
sense
to
see
they
had
some
right
on
their
side
folks
say
he
was
the
smartest
fellow
in
his
class
to
college
good
king
agrippy
how
hot
it
does
git
said
jake
rising
indignantly
as
if
the
fire
alone
were
to
blame
i
must
shove
back
the
cider
again
or
will
bile
over
spite
of
everything
but
is
called
unwholesome
to
get
a
house
full
o
damp
in
the
fall
o
the
year
will
freeze
an
thaw
in
the
walls
all
winter
i
must
git
me
a
new
pipe
if
we
go
to
the
corners
i
i
told
ye
of
a
pipe
a
man
had
aboard
the
schooner
that
time
i
went
to
sea
martin
gave
a
little
grumble
of
assent
was
made
o
some
sort
o
whitish
stuff
like
clay
but
shaped
like
none
else
i
ever
see
and
it
had
a
silver
trimmin
round
it
was
very
light
to
handle
and
it
drawed
most
excellent
i
kind
o
expected
he
may
have
stole
it
he
was
a
hard
lookin
customer
a
dutchman
or
from
some
o
them
parts
o
the
earth
i
wish
while
i
was
about
it
i
gone
one
trip
more
was
it
you
was
tellin
me
that
was
to
work
again
in
lowell
i
should
think
her
husband
folks
would
want
the
child
to
be
fetched
up
there
in
them
boardin
houses
belike
they
do
responded
jacob
but
when
they
get
to
come
round
to
their
ways
o
thinkin
now
after
what
been
and
gone
they
have
cause
to
thank
themselves
she
just
like
her
grandsir
thacher
you
can
see
she
made
out
o
the
same
stuff
you
might
ha
burnt
him
to
the
stake
and
he
stick
to
it
he
liked
it
hanging
and
meant
to
die
that
way
there
an
awful
bad
streak
in
them
thachers
an
you
know
it
as
well
as
i
do
i
expect
there
be
bad
and
good
thachers
to
the
end
o
time
i
glad
for
the
old
lady
sake
that
john
ai
one
o
the
drinkin
ones
give
no
favors
to
her
husband
folks
nor
take
none
there
plenty
o
wrongs
to
both
sides
but
as
i
view
it
the
longer
he
lived
the
worse
would
been
for
him
she
was
a
well
made
pretty
lookin
girl
but
i
tell
ye
was
like
setting
a
laylock
bush
to
grow
beside
an
ellum
tree
and
expecting
of
to
keep
together
they
mates
he
had
a
different
fetchin
up
and
he
different
and
i
surprised
when
i
come
to
see
how
things
had
turned
out
i
believe
i
shall
have
to
set
the
door
open
a
half
a
minute
is
dreadful
but
there
was
a
sudden
flurry
outside
and
the
sound
of
heavy
footsteps
the
bark
of
the
startled
cur
who
was
growing
very
old
and
a
little
deaf
and
martin
burst
into
the
room
and
sank
into
the
nearest
chair
to
gather
a
little
breath
before
she
could
tell
her
errand
for
god
sake
what
happened
cried
the
men
they
presented
a
picture
of
mingled
comfort
and
misery
at
which
martin
would
have
first
laughed
and
then
scolded
at
any
other
time
the
two
honest
red
faces
were
well
back
toward
the
farther
side
of
the
room
from
the
fire
which
still
held
its
own
it
was
growing
toward
low
tide
in
the
cider
jug
and
its
attendant
mugs
and
the
pipes
were
lying
idle
the
mistress
of
the
old
did
not
fail
to
notice
that
high
treason
had
been
committed
during
her
short
absence
but
she
made
no
comment
upon
the
fireplace
nor
on
anything
else
and
gasped
as
soon
as
she
could
that
one
of
the
men
must
go
right
up
to
the
corners
for
the
doctor
and
hurry
back
with
him
was
a
case
of
life
and
death
mis
thacher
was
it
a
shock
asked
the
brothers
in
sorrowful
haste
while
martin
told
the
sad
little
story
of
adeline
having
come
from
nobody
knew
where
wet
and
forlorn
carrying
her
child
in
her
arms
she
looked
as
if
she
were
in
the
last
stages
of
a
decline
she
had
fallen
just
at
the
doorstep
and
they
had
brought
her
in
believing
that
she
was
dead
but
while
there
life
there
hope
said
martin
and
i
go
back
with
you
if
you
harness
up
jacob
must
stop
to
look
after
this
fire
or
burn
the
house
down
and
this
was
the
punishment
which
befell
jacob
since
nothing
else
would
have
kept
him
from
also
journeying
toward
the
thacher
house
a
little
later
the
bewildered
horse
had
been
fully
wakened
and
harnessed
jacob
daughter
and
her
lover
had
come
eagerly
out
to
hear
what
had
happened
martin
had
somehow
found
a
chance
amidst
all
the
confusion
to
ascend
to
her
garret
in
quest
of
some
useful
remedies
in
the
shape
of
herbs
and
then
she
and
her
husband
set
forth
on
their
benevolent
errands
martin
was
very
apt
to
look
on
the
dark
side
of
things
and
it
was
a
curious
fact
that
while
the
two
sisters
were
like
the
brothers
one
being
inclined
to
despondency
and
one
to
enthusiasm
the
balance
was
well
kept
by
each
of
the
men
having
chosen
his
opposite
in
temperament
accordingly
while
martin
heaved
a
great
sigh
from
time
to
time
and
groaned
softly
pore
gal
pore
gal
his
partner
was
brimful
of
zealous
eagerness
to
return
to
the
scene
of
distress
and
sorrow
which
she
had
lately
left
next
to
the
doctor
himself
she
was
the
authority
on
all
medical
subjects
for
that
neighborhood
and
it
was
some
time
since
her
skill
had
been
needed
does
the
young
one
seem
likely
asked
martin
with
solemn
curiosity
fur
i
could
see
answered
his
wife
promptly
but
nobody
took
no
great
notice
of
it
pore
catched
hold
of
it
with
such
a
grip
as
she
was
comin
to
that
we
could
git
it
away
from
her
and
had
to
in
both
to
once
come
urge
the
beast
along
martin
i
give
ye
the
i
do
know
livin
now
we
got
her
right
to
bed
i
told
you
and
i
set
right
off
that
i
could
git
over
the
ground
fastest
of
any
mis
thacher
of
course
would
leave
and
jane
heavier
than
i
be
martin
smile
was
happily
concealed
by
the
darkness
his
wife
and
her
sister
had
both
grown
stout
steadily
as
they
grew
older
but
each
insisted
upon
the
other
greater
magnitude
and
consequent
incapacity
for
quick
movement
a
casual
observer
would
not
have
been
persuaded
that
there
was
a
pound
weight
of
difference
between
them
martin
dyer
meekly
suggested
that
perhaps
he
better
go
in
a
minute
to
see
if
there
was
anything
mis
thacher
needed
but
eliza
his
wife
promptly
said
that
she
did
want
anything
but
the
doctor
as
quick
as
she
could
get
him
and
disappeared
up
the
short
lane
while
the
wagon
rattled
away
up
the
road
the
white
mist
from
the
river
clung
close
to
the
earth
and
it
was
impossible
to
see
even
the
fences
near
at
hand
though
overhead
there
were
a
few
dim
stars
the
air
had
grown
somewhat
softer
yet
there
was
a
sharp
chill
in
it
and
the
ground
was
wet
and
sticky
under
foot
there
were
lights
in
the
bedroom
and
in
the
kitchen
of
the
thacher
house
but
suddenly
the
bedroom
candle
flickered
away
and
the
window
was
darkened
martin
heart
gave
a
quick
throb
perhaps
adeline
had
already
died
it
might
have
been
a
piece
of
business
that
she
had
gone
home
for
her
husband
iv
life
and
death
the
sick
woman
had
refused
to
stay
in
the
bedroom
after
she
had
come
to
her
senses
she
had
insisted
that
she
could
not
breathe
and
that
she
was
cold
and
must
go
back
to
the
kitchen
her
mother
and
jake
had
wrapped
her
in
blankets
and
drawn
the
wooden
rocking
chair
close
to
the
stove
and
here
she
was
just
established
when
martin
opened
the
outer
door
any
one
of
less
reliable
nerves
would
have
betrayed
the
shock
which
the
sight
of
such
desperate
illness
must
have
given
the
pallor
the
suffering
the
desperate
agony
of
the
eyes
were
far
worse
than
the
calmness
of
death
but
martin
spoke
cheerfully
and
even
when
her
sister
whispered
that
their
patient
had
been
attacked
by
a
hæmorrhage
she
manifested
no
concern
how
long
has
this
on
why
did
you
come
home
before
and
get
doctored
up
you
all
run
down
thacher
looked
frightened
when
this
questioning
began
but
turned
her
face
toward
her
daughter
eager
to
hear
the
answer
i
been
sick
off
and
on
all
summer
said
the
young
woman
as
if
it
were
almost
impossible
to
make
the
effort
of
speaking
see
if
the
baby
covered
up
warm
will
you
aunt
yes
dear
said
the
woman
the
tears
starting
to
her
eyes
at
the
sound
of
the
familiar
affectionate
fashion
of
speech
which
adeline
had
used
in
her
childhood
do
you
worry
one
mite
going
to
take
care
of
you
and
the
little
gal
too
and
then
nobody
spoke
while
the
only
sound
was
the
difficult
breathing
of
the
poor
creature
by
the
fire
she
seemed
like
one
dying
there
was
so
little
life
left
in
her
after
her
piteous
homeward
journey
the
mother
watched
her
eagerly
with
a
mingled
feeling
of
despair
and
comfort
it
was
terrible
to
have
a
child
return
in
such
sad
plight
but
it
was
a
blessing
to
have
her
safe
at
home
and
to
be
able
to
minister
to
her
wants
while
life
lasted
they
all
listened
eagerly
for
the
sound
of
wheels
but
it
seemed
a
long
time
before
martin
dyer
returned
with
the
doctor
he
had
been
met
just
as
he
was
coming
in
from
the
other
direction
and
the
two
men
had
only
paused
while
the
tired
horse
was
made
comfortable
and
a
sleepy
boy
dispatched
with
the
medicine
for
which
he
had
long
been
waiting
the
doctor
housekeeper
had
besought
him
to
wait
long
enough
to
eat
the
supper
which
she
had
kept
waiting
but
he
laughed
at
her
and
shook
his
head
gravely
as
if
he
already
understood
that
there
should
be
no
delay
when
he
was
fairly
inside
the
thacher
kitchen
the
benefaction
of
his
presence
was
felt
by
every
one
it
was
most
touching
to
see
the
patient
face
lose
its
worried
look
and
grow
quiet
and
comfortable
as
if
here
were
some
one
on
whom
she
could
entirely
depend
the
doctor
greeting
was
an
cheerful
response
to
the
women
welcome
and
he
stood
for
a
minute
warming
his
hands
at
the
fire
as
if
he
had
come
upon
a
commonplace
errand
there
was
something
singularly
and
composed
about
him
one
felt
that
he
was
the
wielder
of
great
powers
over
the
enemies
disease
and
pain
and
that
his
brave
hazel
eyes
showed
a
rare
thoughtfulness
and
foresight
the
rough
driving
coat
which
he
had
thrown
off
revealed
a
slender
figure
with
the
bowed
shoulders
of
an
untiring
scholar
his
head
was
finely
set
and
scholarly
and
there
was
that
about
him
which
gave
certainty
not
only
of
his
sagacity
and
skill
but
of
his
true
manhood
his
mastery
of
himself
not
only
in
this
kitchen
but
wherever
one
might
place
him
he
instinctively
took
command
while
from
his
great
knowledge
of
human
nature
he
could
understand
and
help
many
of
his
patients
whose
ailments
were
not
wholly
physical
he
seemed
to
read
at
a
glance
the
shame
and
sorrow
of
the
young
woman
who
had
fled
to
the
home
of
her
childhood
dying
and
worse
than
defeated
from
the
of
life
and
in
this
first
moment
he
recognized
with
dismay
the
effects
of
that
passion
for
strong
drink
which
had
been
the
curse
of
more
than
one
of
her
ancestors
even
the
pallor
and
the
purifying
influence
of
her
mortal
illness
could
not
disguise
these
unmistakable
signs
you
ca
do
me
any
good
doctor
she
whispered
i
should
have
let
you
come
if
it
had
been
only
that
i
do
care
how
soon
i
am
out
of
this
world
but
i
want
you
should
look
after
my
little
girl
and
the
poor
soul
watched
the
physician
face
with
keen
anxiety
as
if
she
feared
to
see
a
shadow
of
unwillingness
but
none
came
i
will
do
the
best
i
can
and
he
still
held
her
wrist
apparently
thinking
more
of
the
fluttering
pulse
than
of
what
poor
adeline
was
saying
that
was
what
made
me
willing
to
come
back
she
continued
you
do
know
how
close
i
came
to
not
doing
it
either
john
will
be
good
to
her
but
she
will
need
somebody
that
knows
the
world
better
by
and
by
i
wonder
if
you
could
show
me
how
to
make
out
a
paper
giving
you
the
right
over
her
till
she
is
of
age
she
must
stay
here
with
mother
long
as
she
wants
her
is
what
i
wish
i
had
kept
sense
enough
to
do
life
has
been
all
play
to
me
and
the
tears
began
to
roll
quickly
down
the
poor
creature
thin
cheeks
the
only
thing
i
care
about
is
leaving
the
baby
well
placed
and
i
want
her
to
have
a
good
chance
to
grow
up
a
useful
woman
and
most
of
all
to
keep
her
out
of
hands
i
mean
her
father
folks
i
hate
and
he
cared
more
for
than
he
did
for
me
long
at
the
last
of
it
i
could
tell
you
stories
but
not
addy
said
the
doctor
gravely
as
if
he
were
speaking
to
a
child
we
must
put
you
to
bed
and
to
sleep
and
you
can
talk
about
all
these
troublesome
things
in
the
morning
you
shall
see
about
the
papers
too
if
you
think
best
be
a
good
girl
now
and
let
your
mother
help
you
to
bed
for
the
resolute
spirit
had
summoned
the
few
poor
fragments
of
vitality
that
were
left
and
the
sick
woman
was
growing
more
and
more
excited
you
may
have
all
the
pillows
you
wish
for
and
sit
up
in
bed
if
you
like
but
you
must
stay
here
any
longer
and
he
gathered
her
in
his
arms
and
quickly
carried
her
to
the
next
room
she
made
no
resistance
and
took
the
medicine
which
martin
brought
without
a
word
there
was
a
blazing
fire
now
in
the
bedroom
and
as
she
lay
still
her
face
took
on
a
satisfied
rested
look
her
mother
sat
beside
her
tearful
and
yet
contented
and
glad
to
have
her
near
and
the
others
whispered
together
in
the
kitchen
it
might
have
been
the
last
night
of
a
long
illness
instead
of
the
sudden
startling
entrance
of
sorrow
in
human
shape
no
said
the
doctor
she
can
not
last
much
longer
with
such
a
cough
as
that
dyer
she
has
almost
reached
the
end
of
it
i
only
hope
that
she
will
go
quickly
and
sure
enough
whether
the
fatal
illness
had
run
its
natural
course
or
whether
the
excitement
and
the
forced
strength
of
the
evening
before
had
exhausted
the
small
portion
of
strength
that
was
left
when
the
late
dawn
lighted
again
those
who
watched
it
found
them
sleeping
and
one
was
never
to
wake
again
in
the
world
she
had
found
so
disappointing
to
her
ambitions
and
so
untrue
to
its
fancied
promises
the
doctor
had
promised
to
return
early
but
it
was
hardly
daylight
before
there
was
another
visitor
in
advance
of
him
old
meeker
a
neighbor
whom
nobody
liked
but
whose
favor
everybody
for
some
reason
or
other
was
anxious
to
keep
came
knocking
at
the
door
and
was
let
in
somewhat
reluctantly
by
jake
who
was
just
preparing
to
go
home
in
order
to
send
one
or
both
the
brothers
to
the
village
and
to
acquaint
john
thacher
with
the
sad
news
of
his
sister
death
he
was
older
than
adeline
and
a
silent
man
already
growing
to
be
elderly
in
his
appearance
the
women
had
told
themselves
and
each
other
that
he
would
take
this
sorrow
very
hard
and
thacher
had
said
sorrowfully
that
she
must
hide
her
daughter
poor
worn
clothes
since
it
would
break
john
heart
to
know
she
had
come
home
so
beggarly
the
shock
of
so
much
trouble
was
stunning
the
mother
she
did
not
understand
yet
she
kept
telling
the
kind
friends
who
sorrowed
with
her
as
she
busied
herself
with
the
preparations
for
the
funeral
it
do
seem
as
if
was
addy
she
said
over
and
over
again
but
i
feel
safe
about
her
now
to
what
i
did
and
jake
and
martin
good
helpful
souls
and
brimful
of
compassion
went
to
and
fro
with
their
usual
diligence
almost
as
if
this
were
nothing
out
of
the
common
course
of
events
meeker
had
heard
the
wagon
go
by
and
had
caught
the
sound
of
the
doctor
voice
her
house
being
close
by
the
road
and
she
had
also
watched
the
unusual
lights
it
was
annoying
to
the
dyers
to
have
to
answer
questions
and
to
be
called
upon
to
grieve
outwardly
just
then
and
it
seemed
disloyal
to
the
dead
woman
in
the
next
room
to
enter
upon
any
discussion
of
her
affairs
but
presently
the
little
child
whom
nobody
had
thought
of
except
to
see
that
she
still
slept
waked
and
got
down
from
the
old
settle
where
she
had
spent
the
night
and
walked
with
unsteady
short
footsteps
toward
her
grandmother
who
caught
her
quickly
and
held
her
fast
in
her
arms
the
little
thing
looked
puzzled
and
frowned
and
seemed
for
a
moment
unhappy
and
then
the
sunshine
of
her
good
nature
drove
away
the
clouds
and
she
clapped
her
hands
and
laughed
aloud
while
meeker
began
to
cry
again
at
the
sight
of
this
unconscious
orphan
i
sure
i
glad
she
can
laugh
said
martin
she
find
enough
to
cry
about
later
on
i
foresee
she
be
a
great
deal
company
to
you
mis
thacher
though
ai
every
one
that
has
the
strength
to
fetch
up
a
child
after
they
reach
your
years
said
meeker
mournfully
anxious
work
but
i
do
doubt
strength
will
be
given
you
i
likely
her
father
folks
will
do
a
good
deal
for
her
and
the
three
women
looked
at
each
other
but
neither
took
it
upon
herself
to
answer
all
that
day
the
neighbors
and
acquaintances
came
and
went
in
the
lane
that
led
to
the
the
brothers
jake
and
martin
made
journeys
to
and
from
the
village
at
night
john
thacher
came
home
from
court
with
as
little
to
say
as
ever
but
as
everybody
observed
looking
years
older
young
mrs
prince
return
and
sudden
death
were
the
only
subjects
worth
talking
about
in
all
the
country
side
and
the
doctor
had
to
run
the
usual
gauntlet
of
questions
from
all
his
outlying
patients
and
their
families
old
thacher
looked
pale
and
excited
and
insisted
upon
seeing
every
one
who
came
to
the
house
with
evident
intention
to
play
her
part
in
this
strange
drama
with
exactness
and
courtesy
a
funeral
in
the
country
is
always
an
era
in
a
life
events
date
from
it
and
centre
in
it
there
are
so
few
circumstances
that
have
in
the
least
a
public
nature
that
these
conspicuous
days
receive
all
the
more
attention
but
while
death
seems
far
more
astonishing
and
unnatural
in
a
city
where
the
great
tide
of
life
rises
and
falls
with
little
apparent
regard
to
the
sinking
wrecks
in
the
country
it
is
not
so
the
neighbors
themselves
are
those
who
dig
the
grave
and
carry
the
dead
whom
they
or
their
friends
have
made
ready
to
the
last
with
all
nature
looking
on
the
leaves
that
must
fall
and
the
grass
of
the
field
that
must
wither
and
be
gone
when
the
wind
passes
over
living
closer
to
life
and
in
plainer
sight
of
death
they
have
a
different
sense
of
the
mysteries
of
existence
they
pay
homage
to
death
rather
than
to
the
dead
they
gather
from
the
lonely
farms
by
scores
because
there
is
a
funeral
and
not
because
their
friend
is
dead
and
the
day
of
adeline
prince
burial
the
marvelous
circumstances
with
which
the
whole
town
was
already
familiar
brought
a
great
company
together
to
follow
her
on
her
last
journey
the
day
was
warm
and
the
sunshine
fell
caressingly
over
the
pastures
as
if
it
were
trying
to
call
back
the
flowers
by
afternoon
there
was
a
tinge
of
greenness
on
the
slopes
and
under
the
gnarled
that
had
been
lost
for
days
before
and
the
distant
hills
and
mountains
which
could
be
seen
in
a
circle
from
the
high
land
where
the
thacher
farmhouse
stood
were
dim
and
blue
through
the
indian
summer
haze
the
old
men
who
came
to
the
funeral
wore
their
faded
winter
overcoats
and
clumsy
caps
all
ready
to
be
pulled
down
over
their
ears
if
the
wind
should
change
and
their
wives
were
also
warmly
wrapped
with
great
shawls
over
their
rounded
shoulders
yet
they
took
the
best
warmth
and
pleasantness
into
their
hearts
and
watched
the
sad
proceedings
of
the
afternoon
with
deepest
interest
the
doctor
came
hurrying
toward
home
just
as
the
long
procession
was
going
down
the
pasture
and
he
saw
it
crossing
a
low
hill
a
dark
and
slender
column
with
here
and
there
a
child
walking
beside
one
of
the
elder
mourners
the
bearers
went
first
with
the
bier
the
track
was
uneven
and
the
procession
was
lost
to
sight
now
and
then
behind
the
slopes
it
was
forever
a
mystery
these
people
might
have
been
a
company
of
druid
worshipers
or
of
strange
northern
priests
and
their
people
and
the
doctor
checked
his
impatient
horse
as
he
watched
the
retreating
figures
at
their
simple
ceremony
he
could
not
help
thinking
what
strange
ways
this
child
of
the
old
farm
had
followed
and
what
a
quiet
ending
it
was
to
her
wandering
life
and
i
have
promised
to
look
after
the
little
girl
he
said
to
himself
as
he
drove
away
up
the
road
it
was
a
long
walk
for
the
elderly
people
from
the
house
near
the
main
highway
to
the
little
in
the
earliest
days
of
the
farm
the
was
nearer
the
river
which
was
then
the
chief
thoroughfare
and
those
of
the
family
who
had
died
then
were
buried
on
the
level
bit
of
upland
ground
high
above
the
river
itself
there
was
a
wide
outlook
over
the
country
and
the
young
pine
trees
that
fringed
the
shore
sang
in
the
south
wind
while
some
great
birds
swung
to
and
fro
overhead
watching
the
water
and
the
strange
company
of
people
who
had
come
so
slowly
over
the
land
a
flock
of
sheep
had
ventured
to
the
nearest
hillock
of
the
next
pasture
and
stood
there
fearfully
with
upraised
heads
as
if
they
looked
for
danger
john
thacher
had
brought
his
sister
child
all
the
way
in
his
arms
and
she
had
clapped
her
hands
and
laughed
aloud
and
tried
to
talk
a
great
deal
with
the
few
words
she
had
learned
to
say
she
was
very
gay
in
her
baby
fashion
she
was
amused
with
the
little
crowd
so
long
as
it
did
not
trouble
her
she
fretted
only
when
the
grave
kind
man
for
whom
she
had
instantly
felt
a
great
affection
stayed
too
long
by
that
deep
hole
in
the
ground
and
wept
as
he
saw
a
strange
thing
that
the
people
had
carried
all
the
way
put
down
into
it
out
of
sight
when
he
walked
on
again
she
laughed
and
played
but
after
they
had
reached
the
empty
gray
house
which
somehow
looked
that
day
as
if
it
were
a
mourner
also
she
shrank
from
all
the
strangers
and
seemed
dismayed
and
perplexed
and
called
her
mother
eagerly
again
and
again
this
touched
many
a
heart
the
dead
woman
had
been
more
or
less
unfamiliar
of
late
years
to
all
of
them
and
there
were
few
who
had
really
grieved
for
her
until
her
little
child
had
reminded
them
of
its
own
loneliness
and
loss
that
night
after
the
house
was
still
john
thacher
wrote
to
acquaint
miss
prince
of
dunport
with
his
sister
death
and
to
say
that
it
was
her
wish
that
the
child
should
remain
with
them
during
its
minority
they
should
formally
appoint
the
guardian
whom
she
had
selected
they
would
do
their
best
by
the
little
girl
and
when
thacher
asked
if
he
had
blamed
miss
prince
he
replied
that
he
had
left
that
to
her
own
conscience
in
the
answer
which
was
quickly
returned
there
was
a
plea
for
the
custody
of
the
child
her
mother
and
her
own
namesake
but
this
was
indignantly
refused
there
was
no
love
lost
between
the
town
and
the
country
household
and
for
many
years
all
intercourse
was
at
an
end
before
twelve
months
were
past
john
thacher
himself
was
carried
down
to
the
pasture
and
his
old
mother
and
the
little
child
were
left
to
comfort
and
take
care
of
each
other
as
best
they
could
in
the
lonely
v
a
sunday
visit
in
the
gray
house
on
the
hill
one
spring
went
by
and
another
and
it
seemed
to
the
busy
doctor
only
a
few
months
from
the
night
he
first
saw
his
ward
before
she
was
old
enough
to
come
soberly
to
church
with
her
grandmother
he
had
always
seen
her
from
time
to
time
for
he
had
often
been
called
to
the
farm
or
to
the
dyers
and
had
watched
her
at
play
once
she
had
stopped
him
as
he
drove
by
to
give
him
a
little
handful
of
blue
violets
and
this
had
gone
straight
to
his
heart
for
he
had
been
made
too
great
a
bugbear
to
most
children
to
look
for
any
favor
at
their
hands
he
always
liked
to
see
her
come
into
church
on
sundays
her
steps
growing
quicker
and
surer
as
her
good
became
more
feeble
the
doctor
was
a
lonely
man
in
spite
of
his
many
friends
and
he
found
himself
watching
for
the
little
brown
face
that
across
the
old
would
turn
round
to
look
for
him
more
than
once
during
the
service
at
first
there
was
only
the
top
of
little
nan
prince
prim
best
bonnet
or
hood
to
be
seen
unless
it
was
when
she
stood
up
in
but
soon
the
bright
eyes
rose
like
stars
above
the
horizon
of
the
pew
railing
and
next
there
was
the
whole
little
head
and
the
tall
child
was
possessed
by
a
sense
of
propriety
and
only
ventured
one
or
two
discreet
glances
at
her
old
friend
the
office
of
guardian
was
not
one
of
great
tasks
or
of
many
duties
though
the
child
aunt
had
insisted
upon
making
an
allowance
for
her
of
a
hundred
dollars
a
year
and
this
was
duly
acknowledged
and
placed
to
its
owner
credit
in
the
savings
bank
of
the
next
town
her
grandmother
thacher
always
refused
to
spend
it
saying
proudly
that
she
had
never
been
beholden
to
miss
prince
and
she
never
meant
to
be
and
while
she
lived
the
aunt
and
niece
should
be
kept
apart
she
would
not
say
that
her
daughter
had
never
been
at
fault
but
it
was
through
the
princes
all
the
trouble
of
her
life
had
come
leslie
was
mindful
of
his
responsibilities
and
knew
more
of
his
ward
than
was
ever
suspected
he
was
eager
that
the
best
district
school
teacher
who
could
be
found
should
be
procured
for
the
thacher
and
dyer
neighborhood
and
in
many
ways
he
took
pains
that
the
little
girl
should
have
all
good
things
that
were
possible
he
only
laughed
when
her
grandmother
complained
that
nan
would
not
be
driven
to
school
much
less
persuaded
and
that
she
was
playing
in
the
brook
or
scampering
over
the
pastures
when
she
should
be
doing
other
things
thacher
perhaps
unconsciously
had
looked
for
some
trace
of
the
father
good
breeding
and
gentlefolk
fashions
but
this
was
not
a
child
who
took
kindly
to
needlework
and
pretty
clothes
she
was
fearlessly
friendly
with
every
one
she
did
not
seem
confused
even
when
the
minister
came
to
make
his
yearly
parochial
visitation
and
as
for
the
doctor
he
might
have
been
her
own
age
for
all
humility
she
thought
it
necessary
to
show
in
the
presence
of
this
chief
among
her
elders
and
betters
old
thacher
gave
little
pulls
at
her
granddaughter
sleeves
when
she
kept
turning
to
see
the
doctor
in
but
she
never
knew
how
glad
he
was
or
how
willingly
he
smiled
when
he
felt
the
child
eyes
watching
him
as
a
dog
might
have
done
forcing
him
to
forget
the
preaching
altogether
and
to
attend
to
this
dumb
request
for
sympathy
one
blessed
day
leslie
had
waited
in
the
church
porch
and
gravely
taken
the
child
hand
as
she
came
out
and
said
that
he
should
like
to
take
her
home
with
him
he
was
going
to
the
lower
part
of
the
town
late
in
the
afternoon
and
would
leave
her
then
at
the
i
was
going
to
ask
you
for
something
for
her
shoulder
said
grandmother
thacher
much
pleased
she
tell
you
about
it
it
was
a
fall
she
had
out
of
an
and
nan
looked
up
with
not
a
little
apprehension
but
presently
tucked
her
small
hand
inside
the
doctor
and
was
more
than
ready
to
go
with
him
i
thought
she
looked
a
little
pale
the
doctor
said
to
which
thacher
answered
that
it
was
a
merciful
providence
who
had
kept
the
child
from
breaking
her
neck
and
then
being
at
the
foot
of
the
church
steps
they
separated
it
had
been
a
great
trial
to
the
good
woman
to
give
up
the
afternoon
service
but
she
was
growing
old
as
she
told
herself
often
in
those
days
and
felt
as
she
certainly
looked
greatly
older
than
her
years
i
feel
as
if
anna
was
sure
of
one
good
friend
whether
i
stay
with
her
or
not
said
the
grandmother
sorrowfully
as
she
drove
toward
home
that
sunday
noon
with
jacob
dyer
and
his
wife
i
never
saw
the
doctor
so
taken
with
a
child
before
was
a
pity
he
had
to
lose
his
own
and
his
wife
too
how
many
years
ago
was
it
i
should
think
be
lonesome
though
to
be
sure
he
is
in
the
house
much
marilla
thomas
keeps
his
house
as
clean
as
a
button
and
she
has
been
a
good
for
him
but
it
always
seemed
sort
o
homesick
there
ever
since
the
day
i
was
to
his
wife
funeral
she
made
an
awful
sight
friends
considering
she
was
so
little
while
in
the
place
well
glad
i
let
nanny
wear
her
best
dress
i
set
out
not
to
it
looked
so
much
like
rain
whatever
marilla
thomas
other
failings
might
have
been
she
certainly
was
kind
that
day
to
the
doctor
little
guest
it
would
have
been
a
person
indeed
who
did
not
enter
somewhat
into
the
spirit
of
the
child
delight
in
spite
of
its
being
the
first
time
she
had
ever
sat
at
any
table
but
her
grandmother
she
was
not
awkward
or
uncomfortable
and
was
so
hungry
that
she
gave
pleasure
to
her
entertainers
in
that
way
if
no
other
the
doctor
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
waited
while
the
second
portion
of
pudding
slowly
disappeared
though
marilla
could
have
told
that
he
usually
did
not
give
half
time
enough
to
his
dinner
and
was
off
like
an
arrow
the
first
possible
minute
before
he
took
his
often
interrupted
afternoon
nap
he
inquired
for
the
damaged
shoulder
and
requested
a
detailed
account
of
the
accident
and
presently
they
were
both
laughing
heartily
at
nan
disaster
for
she
owned
that
she
had
chased
and
treed
a
stray
young
squirrel
and
that
a
mossy
branch
of
one
of
the
old
in
the
straggling
orchard
had
failed
to
bear
even
so
light
a
weight
as
hers
nan
had
come
to
the
ground
because
she
would
not
loose
her
hold
of
the
squirrel
though
he
had
slipped
through
her
hands
after
all
as
she
carried
him
towards
home
the
guest
was
proud
to
become
a
patient
especially
as
the
only
remedy
that
was
offered
was
a
very
comfortable
handful
of
nan
had
never
owned
so
many
at
once
and
in
a
transport
of
gratitude
and
affection
she
lifted
her
face
to
kiss
so
dear
a
benefactor
her
eyes
looked
up
into
his
and
her
simple
nature
was
so
unconscious
of
the
true
dangers
and
perils
of
this
world
that
his
very
heart
was
touched
with
compassion
and
he
leagued
himself
with
the
child
good
angel
to
defend
her
against
her
enemies
and
nan
took
fast
hold
of
the
doctor
hand
as
they
went
to
the
study
this
was
the
only
room
in
the
house
which
she
had
seen
before
and
was
so
much
larger
and
pleasanter
than
any
she
knew
elsewhere
that
she
took
great
delight
in
it
it
was
a
rough
place
now
the
doctor
thought
but
always
very
comfortable
and
he
laid
himself
down
on
the
great
sofa
with
a
book
in
his
hand
though
after
a
few
minutes
he
grew
sleepy
and
only
opened
his
eyes
once
to
see
that
nan
was
perched
in
the
largest
chair
with
her
small
hands
folded
and
her
feet
very
far
from
the
floor
you
may
run
out
to
see
marilla
or
go
about
the
house
anywhere
you
like
or
there
are
some
on
the
table
the
doctor
said
drowsily
and
the
visitor
slipped
down
from
her
throne
and
went
softly
away
she
had
thought
the
study
a
very
noble
room
until
she
had
seen
the
but
now
she
wished
for
another
look
at
the
pictures
there
and
the
queer
clock
and
the
strange
grand
things
on
the
sideboard
the
comfort
of
the
house
was
perfect
splendor
to
the
child
and
she
went
about
on
tiptoe
up
stairs
and
down
looking
in
at
the
open
doors
while
she
lingered
wistfully
before
the
closed
ones
she
wondered
at
the
great
bedsteads
with
their
high
posts
and
dimity
hangings
and
at
the
carpets
and
the
worthy
marilla
watched
her
for
a
moment
as
she
stood
on
the
threshold
of
the
doctor
own
room
the
child
quick
ear
caught
the
rustle
of
the
housekeeper
sunday
gown
she
whispered
with
shining
eyes
that
she
thought
the
house
was
beautiful
did
marilla
live
here
all
the
time
bless
you
yes
replied
marilla
not
without
pride
though
she
added
that
nobody
knew
what
a
sight
of
care
it
was
i
suppose
aunt
in
dunport
lives
a
good
deal
better
than
this
but
the
child
only
looked
puzzled
and
did
not
answer
while
the
housekeeper
hurried
away
to
the
afternoon
meeting
for
which
the
bell
was
already
tolling
the
doctor
slept
on
in
the
shaded
study
and
after
nan
had
grown
tired
of
walking
softly
about
the
house
she
found
her
way
into
the
garden
after
all
there
was
nothing
better
than
being
out
of
doors
and
the
seemed
most
familiar
and
friendly
though
she
pitied
them
for
being
placed
so
near
each
other
she
discovered
a
bench
under
a
trellis
where
a
and
a
clematis
were
tangled
together
and
here
she
sat
down
to
spend
a
little
time
before
the
doctor
should
call
her
she
wished
she
could
stay
longer
than
that
one
short
afternoon
perhaps
some
time
or
other
the
doctor
would
invite
her
again
but
what
could
marilla
have
meant
about
her
aunt
she
had
no
aunts
except
jake
and
martin
marilla
must
well
know
that
their
houses
were
not
like
leslie
and
little
nan
built
herself
a
fine
castle
in
spain
of
which
this
unknown
aunt
was
queen
certainly
her
grandmother
had
now
and
then
let
fall
a
word
about
your
father
folks
by
and
by
they
might
come
to
see
her
the
grape
leaves
were
waving
about
in
the
warm
wind
and
they
made
a
flickering
light
and
shade
upon
the
ground
the
clematis
was
in
bloom
and
its
soft
white
plumes
fringed
the
archway
of
the
lattice
work
as
the
child
looked
down
the
garden
walk
it
seemed
very
long
and
very
beautiful
to
her
her
grandmother
had
been
constantly
encroached
upon
by
the
turf
which
surrounded
it
until
the
snowberry
bush
the
london
pride
the
and
the
crimson
phlox
were
like
a
besieged
garrison
nan
had
already
found
plenty
of
wild
flowers
in
the
world
there
were
no
entertainments
provided
for
her
except
those
the
fields
and
pastures
kindly
spread
before
her
admiring
eyes
old
thacher
had
been
brought
up
to
consider
the
hard
work
of
this
life
and
though
she
had
taken
her
share
of
enjoyment
as
she
went
along
it
was
of
a
somewhat
grim
and
sober
sort
she
believed
that
a
certain
amount
of
friskiness
was
as
necessary
to
young
human
beings
as
it
is
to
colts
but
later
both
must
be
harnessed
and
made
to
work
as
for
pleasure
itself
she
had
little
notion
of
that
she
liked
fair
weather
and
certain
flowers
were
to
her
the
decorations
of
certain
useful
plants
but
if
she
had
known
that
her
could
lie
down
beside
the
anemones
and
watch
them
move
in
the
wind
and
nod
their
heads
and
afterward
look
up
into
the
blue
sky
to
watch
the
great
gulls
above
the
river
or
the
sparrows
flying
low
or
the
crows
who
went
higher
thacher
would
have
understood
almost
nothing
of
such
delights
and
thought
it
a
very
idle
way
of
spending
one
time
but
as
nan
sat
in
the
old
in
the
doctor
garden
she
thought
of
many
things
that
she
must
remember
to
tell
her
grandmother
about
this
delightful
day
the
bees
were
humming
in
the
vines
and
as
she
looked
down
the
wide
it
seemed
like
the
broad
aisle
in
church
and
the
congregation
of
plants
and
bushes
all
looked
at
her
as
if
she
were
in
the
pulpit
the
church
itself
was
not
far
away
and
the
windows
were
open
and
sometimes
nan
could
hear
the
preacher
voice
and
by
and
by
the
people
began
to
sing
and
she
rose
solemnly
as
if
it
were
her
own
parishioners
in
the
garden
who
lifted
up
their
voices
a
cheerful
robin
began
a
loud
solo
in
one
of
and
the
little
girl
laughed
aloud
in
her
and
then
the
gate
was
opened
and
shut
and
the
doctor
himself
appeared
strolling
along
and
smiling
as
he
came
he
was
looking
to
the
right
and
left
at
his
flowers
and
trees
and
once
he
stopped
and
took
out
his
pocket
knife
to
trim
a
straying
branch
of
honeysuckle
which
had
wilted
and
died
when
he
came
to
the
he
found
his
guest
sitting
there
demurely
with
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
she
had
gathered
some
little
sprigs
of
box
and
a
few
blossoms
of
periwinkle
and
late
lilies
of
the
valley
and
they
lay
on
the
bench
beside
her
so
you
did
not
go
to
church
with
marilla
the
doctor
said
i
dare
say
one
sermon
a
day
is
enough
for
so
small
a
person
as
you
for
nan
part
no
sermon
at
all
would
have
caused
little
sorrow
though
she
liked
the
excitement
of
the
sunday
drive
to
the
village
she
only
smiled
when
the
doctor
spoke
and
gave
a
little
sigh
of
satisfaction
a
minute
afterward
when
he
seated
himself
beside
her
we
must
be
off
presently
he
told
her
i
have
a
long
drive
to
take
before
night
i
would
let
you
go
with
me
but
i
am
afraid
i
should
keep
you
too
long
past
your
bedtime
the
little
girl
looked
in
his
kind
face
appealingly
she
could
not
bear
to
have
the
day
come
to
an
end
the
doctor
spoke
to
her
as
if
she
were
grown
up
and
understood
everything
and
this
pleased
her
it
is
very
hard
to
be
constantly
reminded
that
one
is
a
child
as
if
it
were
a
crime
against
society
leslie
unlike
many
others
did
not
like
children
because
they
were
children
he
now
and
then
made
friends
with
one
just
as
he
added
now
and
then
to
his
narrow
circle
of
grown
friends
he
felt
a
certain
responsibility
for
this
little
girl
and
congratulated
himself
upon
feeling
an
instinctive
fondness
for
her
the
good
old
minister
had
said
only
that
morning
that
love
is
the
great
motive
power
that
it
is
always
easy
to
do
things
for
those
whom
we
love
and
wish
to
please
and
for
this
reason
we
are
taught
to
pray
for
love
to
god
and
so
conquer
the
difficulty
of
holiness
but
i
must
do
my
duty
by
her
at
any
rate
the
doctor
told
himself
i
am
afraid
i
have
forgotten
the
child
somewhat
in
past
years
and
she
is
a
bright
little
creature
have
you
been
taking
good
care
of
yourself
he
added
aloud
i
was
very
tired
for
i
was
out
twice
in
the
night
taking
care
of
sick
people
but
you
must
come
to
see
me
again
some
day
i
dare
say
you
and
marilla
have
made
friends
with
each
other
now
we
must
go
i
suppose
and
nan
prince
still
silent
for
the
pleasure
of
this
time
was
almost
too
great
took
hold
of
the
doctor
outstretched
hand
and
they
went
slowly
up
the
garden
walk
together
as
they
drove
slowly
down
the
street
they
met
the
people
who
were
coming
from
church
and
the
child
sat
up
very
straight
in
the
old
gig
with
her
feet
on
the
doctor
and
was
sure
that
everybody
must
be
envying
her
she
thought
it
was
more
pleasant
than
ever
that
afternoon
as
they
passed
through
the
open
country
outside
the
village
the
fields
and
the
trees
were
marvelously
green
and
the
distant
river
was
shining
in
the
sun
nan
looked
anxiously
for
the
gray
farmhouse
for
two
or
three
minutes
before
they
came
in
sight
of
it
but
at
last
it
showed
itself
standing
firm
on
the
hillside
it
seemed
a
long
time
since
she
had
left
home
in
the
morning
but
this
beautiful
day
was
to
be
one
of
the
landmarks
of
her
memory
life
had
suddenly
grown
much
larger
and
her
familiar
horizon
had
vanished
and
she
discovered
a
great
distance
stretching
far
beyond
the
old
limits
she
went
gravely
into
the
familiar
kitchen
holding
fast
the
bits
of
box
and
the
periwinkle
flowers
quite
ready
to
answer
her
grandmother
questions
though
she
was
only
too
certain
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
tell
any
one
the
whole
dear
story
of
that
june
sunday
a
little
later
as
marilla
came
sedately
home
she
noticed
in
the
driveway
some
fresh
hoofmarks
which
pointed
toward
the
street
and
quickly
assured
herself
that
they
could
not
have
been
made
very
long
before
i
wonder
what
the
two
of
have
been
doing
all
the
afternoon
she
said
to
herself
she
a
little
lady
that
child
is
and
it
a
burnin
shame
she
should
be
left
to
run
wild
i
never
set
so
much
by
her
mother
looks
as
some
did
but
growin
things
has
blooms
as
much
as
they
have
roots
and
prickles
and
even
them
thachers
will
flower
out
once
in
a
while
vi
in
summer
weather
one
morning
leslie
remembered
an
old
patient
whom
he
liked
to
go
to
see
now
and
then
perhaps
more
from
the
courtesy
and
friendliness
of
the
thing
than
from
any
hope
of
giving
professional
assistance
the
old
sailor
captain
finch
had
long
before
been
condemned
as
unseaworthy
having
suffered
for
many
years
from
the
effects
of
a
bad
fall
on
shipboard
he
was
a
cheerful
and
wise
person
and
the
doctor
was
much
attached
to
him
besides
knowing
that
he
had
borne
his
imprisonment
with
great
patience
for
his
life
on
one
of
the
most
secluded
farms
of
the
region
surrounded
by
his
wife
kinsfolk
who
were
all
landsmen
could
hardly
be
called
anything
else
the
doctor
had
once
made
a
voyage
to
fayal
and
from
thence
to
england
in
a
having
been
somewhat
delicate
in
health
in
his
younger
days
and
this
made
him
a
more
intelligent
listener
to
the
stories
than
was
often
available
leslie
had
brought
his
case
of
medicines
from
mere
force
of
habit
but
by
way
of
special
prescription
he
had
taken
also
a
generous
handful
of
his
best
cigars
and
wrapped
them
somewhat
clumsily
in
one
of
the
large
sheets
of
which
lay
on
his
study
table
near
by
also
he
had
stopped
before
the
old
sideboard
in
the
carefully
darkened
and
taken
a
bottle
of
wine
from
one
of
its
cupboards
this
will
do
him
more
good
than
anything
poor
old
fellow
he
told
himself
with
a
sudden
warmth
in
his
own
heart
and
a
feeling
of
grateful
pleasure
because
he
had
thought
of
doing
the
kindness
marilla
called
eagerly
from
the
kitchen
window
to
ask
where
he
was
going
putting
her
hand
out
hastily
to
part
the
vines
which
had
climbed
their
strings
and
twisted
their
stems
together
until
they
shut
out
the
world
from
their
planter
sight
but
the
doctor
only
answered
that
he
should
be
back
at
dinner
time
and
settled
himself
comfortably
in
his
carriage
smiling
as
he
thought
of
marilla
displeasure
she
seldom
allowed
a
secret
to
escape
her
if
she
were
once
fairly
on
the
scent
of
it
though
she
grumbled
now
and
told
herself
that
she
only
cared
to
know
for
the
sake
of
the
people
who
might
come
or
to
provide
against
the
accident
of
his
being
among
the
missing
in
case
of
sudden
need
she
found
life
more
interesting
when
there
was
even
a
small
mystery
to
be
puzzled
over
it
was
impossible
for
leslie
to
resist
teasing
his
faithful
once
in
a
while
but
he
did
it
with
proper
gravity
and
respect
and
their
friendship
was
cemented
by
these
sober
jokes
rather
than
torn
apart
the
horse
knew
as
well
as
his
master
that
nothing
of
particular
importance
was
in
hand
and
however
well
he
always
caught
the
spirit
of
the
occasion
when
there
was
need
for
hurry
he
now
jogged
along
the
road
going
slowly
where
the
trees
cast
a
pleasant
shade
and
paying
more
attention
to
the
flies
than
to
anything
else
the
doctor
seemed
to
be
in
deep
thought
and
old
major
understood
that
no
notice
was
to
be
taken
of
constant
slight
touches
of
the
whip
which
his
master
held
carelessly
it
had
been
hot
dusty
weather
until
the
day
and
night
before
when
heavy
showers
had
fallen
the
country
was
looking
fresh
and
the
fields
and
trees
were
washed
clean
at
last
from
the
white
dust
that
had
powdered
them
and
given
the
farms
a
barren
and
discouraged
look
they
had
come
in
sight
of
thacher
house
on
its
high
hillside
and
were
just
passing
the
abode
of
meeker
which
was
close
by
the
roadside
in
the
low
land
this
was
a
small
dwelling
and
the
pink
and
red
hollyhocks
showed
themselves
in
fine
array
against
its
gray
walls
its
mistress
prosaic
nature
had
one
most
redeeming
quality
in
her
love
for
flowers
and
her
gift
in
making
them
grow
and
the
doctor
forgave
her
many
things
for
the
sake
of
the
bright
little
garden
in
the
midst
of
the
sandy
lands
which
surrounded
her
garden
with
their
unshaded
barrenness
the
road
that
crossed
these
was
hot
in
summer
and
swept
by
bitter
winds
in
winter
it
was
like
a
bit
of
desert
dropped
by
mistake
among
the
green
farms
and
forests
that
covered
the
rest
of
the
river
uplands
no
sentinel
was
ever
more
steadfast
to
his
duty
in
time
of
war
and
disorder
than
meeker
as
she
sat
by
the
front
window
from
which
she
could
see
some
distance
either
way
along
the
crooked
road
she
was
often
absent
from
her
own
house
to
render
assistance
of
one
sort
or
another
among
her
neighbors
but
if
she
were
at
home
it
was
impossible
for
man
woman
or
child
to
go
by
without
her
challenge
or
careful
inspection
she
made
couriers
of
her
neighbors
and
sent
these
errand
men
and
women
along
the
country
roads
or
to
the
village
almost
daily
she
was
well
posted
in
the
news
from
both
the
village
and
the
country
side
and
however
much
her
acquaintances
scolded
about
her
they
found
it
impossible
to
resist
the
fascination
of
her
conversation
and
few
declined
to
share
in
the
banquet
of
gossip
which
she
was
always
ready
to
spread
she
was
quick
witted
and
possessed
of
many
resources
and
much
cleverness
of
a
certain
sort
but
it
must
be
confessed
that
she
had
done
mischief
in
her
day
having
been
the
murderer
of
more
than
one
neighbor
peace
of
mind
and
the
assailant
of
many
a
reputation
but
if
she
were
a
dangerous
inmate
of
one
household
few
were
so
attractive
or
entertaining
for
the
space
of
an
afternoon
visit
and
it
was
usually
said
when
she
was
seen
approaching
that
she
would
be
sure
to
have
something
to
tell
out
in
the
country
where
so
many
people
can
see
nothing
new
from
one
week
end
to
the
other
it
is
after
all
a
great
pleasure
to
have
the
latest
particulars
brought
to
one
door
as
a
townsman
newspaper
is
meeker
knew
better
than
to
stop
leslie
if
he
were
going
anywhere
in
a
hurry
she
had
been
taught
this
lesson
years
ago
but
when
she
saw
him
journeying
in
such
a
leisurely
way
some
instinct
assured
her
of
safety
and
she
came
out
of
her
door
like
a
while
old
major
only
too
ready
for
a
halt
stood
still
in
spite
of
a
desperate
twitch
of
the
reins
which
had
as
much
effect
as
pulling
at
a
which
has
made
fast
to
an
anchor
meeker
feigned
a
great
excitement
i
wo
keep
you
but
a
moment
she
said
but
i
want
to
hear
what
you
think
about
mis
thacher
chances
mrs
thacher
repeated
the
doctor
wonderingly
she
doing
well
is
she
i
do
suppose
that
she
will
ever
be
a
young
woman
again
i
do
know
why
but
i
took
it
for
granted
that
you
was
there
explained
meeker
humbly
she
has
seemed
to
me
as
if
she
was
failing
all
summer
i
was
up
there
last
night
and
i
never
said
so
to
her
but
she
had
aged
dreadfully
i
wonder
if
it
likely
she
had
a
light
shock
sometimes
the
fust
one
kind
o
hidden
comes
by
night
or
somethin
and
folks
do
know
till
they
begins
to
feel
the
damage
of
it
she
has
looked
very
well
of
late
said
the
doctor
for
once
in
his
life
he
was
willing
to
have
a
friendly
talk
meeker
thought
and
she
proceeded
to
make
the
most
of
her
opportunity
i
think
the
care
of
that
girl
of
has
been
too
much
for
her
all
along
she
announced
she
wild
as
a
hawk
and
a
perfect
torment
one
day
she
come
strollin
in
and
beseechin
me
for
a
bunch
o
flowers
and
the
next
she
be
here
after
dark
scarin
me
out
o
my
seven
senses
she
rigged
a
here
the
other
night
against
the
window
and
my
heart
was
in
my
mouth
i
thought
was
a
warnin
much
as
ever
i
thought
anything
in
my
life
the
night
before
my
mother
died
was
in
that
same
room
and
against
that
same
winder
there
came
two
or
three
raps
and
my
sister
drew
and
me
we
looked
at
each
other
and
turned
cold
all
over
and
mother
set
right
up
in
bed
the
next
night
and
looked
at
that
winder
and
then
laid
back
dead
i
was
all
sole
alone
the
other
evenin
wednesday
it
was
and
when
i
heard
them
raps
i
mustered
up
and
went
and
put
my
head
out
o
the
door
and
i
could
see
nothing
and
when
i
went
back
knock
knock
it
begun
again
and
i
went
to
the
door
and
harked
i
hoped
i
should
hear
somebody
or
comin
along
the
road
and
then
i
heard
somethin
a
amongst
the
sunflowers
and
hollyhocks
and
then
there
was
a
titterin
and
come
to
find
out
was
that
young
one
i
chased
her
up
the
road
till
my
wind
give
out
and
i
had
to
go
and
set
on
the
stone
wall
and
come
to
she
wo
go
to
bed
till
she
a
mind
to
one
night
i
was
up
there
this
spring
and
she
never
come
in
until
after
nine
a
dark
night
too
and
the
pore
old
lady
was
in
distress
and
thought
she
got
into
the
river
i
says
to
myself
there
no
such
good
news
she
told
how
she
up
into
jake
martin
oaks
trying
to
catch
a
little
screech
owl
she
belongs
with
wild
creatur
i
do
believe
just
the
same
natur
she
better
be
kept
to
school
o
growin
up
this
way
but
she
keeps
the
rest
o
the
young
ones
all
in
a
brile
and
this
last
teacher
would
have
her
there
at
all
she
toll
off
half
the
school
into
the
pasture
at
recess
time
and
none
of
would
get
back
for
half
an
hour
what
a
i
do
remember
asked
the
doctor
who
had
been
smiling
now
and
then
at
this
complaint
they
tie
a
nail
to
the
end
of
a
string
and
run
it
over
a
bent
pin
stuck
in
the
sash
and
then
they
get
out
o
sight
and
pull
and
it
clacks
against
the
winder
do
ye
see
ai
it
surprisin
how
them
devil
tricks
gets
handed
down
from
gineration
to
gineration
while
so
much
that
good
is
forgot
lamented
meeker
but
the
doctor
looked
much
amused
she
a
bright
child
he
said
and
not
over
strong
i
do
believe
in
keeping
young
folks
shut
up
in
the
schoolhouses
all
summer
long
meeker
sniffed
disapprovingly
she
tougher
than
ellum
roots
i
believe
you
ca
kill
them
young
ones
she
run
like
a
fox
all
day
long
and
live
to
see
us
all
buried
i
can
put
up
with
her
pranks
is
of
pore
old
mis
thacher
i
thinkin
she
had
trouble
enough
without
adding
on
this
young
you
had
better
fetch
her
up
to
be
a
doctor
meeker
smilingly
continued
i
was
up
there
yisterday
and
one
of
the
young
turkeys
had
come
hoppin
and
quawkin
round
the
doorsteps
with
its
leg
broke
and
caught
it
and
fixed
it
off
with
a
splint
before
you
could
say
jack
she
told
how
it
was
the
way
you
done
to
jim
finch
that
fell
from
the
and
broke
his
arm
over
to
jake
an
martin
haying
time
i
remember
she
was
standing
close
by
watching
everything
i
did
said
the
doctor
his
face
shining
with
interest
and
pleasure
i
shall
have
to
carry
her
about
for
clerk
her
father
studied
medicine
you
know
it
is
the
most
amazing
thing
how
people
inherit
but
he
did
not
finish
his
sentence
and
pulled
the
reins
so
quickly
that
the
wise
horse
knew
there
was
no
excuse
for
not
moving
forward
meeker
had
hoped
for
a
longer
interview
stop
as
you
come
back
wo
you
she
asked
i
goin
to
pick
you
some
of
the
handsomest
poppies
i
ever
raised
i
got
the
seed
from
my
cousin
she
that
was
gregg
and
they
do
beat
everything
they
wilt
so
that
it
ai
no
use
to
pick
now
unless
you
was
to
come
home
by
the
other
road
there
nobody
sick
about
here
is
there
to
which
the
doctor
returned
a
shake
of
the
head
and
the
information
that
he
should
be
returning
that
way
about
noon
as
he
drove
up
the
hill
he
assured
himself
with
great
satisfaction
that
he
believed
he
had
told
anything
that
morning
which
would
be
repeated
all
over
town
before
night
while
his
hostess
returned
to
her
house
quite
dissatisfied
with
the
interview
though
she
hoped
for
better
fortune
on
leslie
return
for
his
part
he
drove
on
slowly
past
the
thacher
farmhouse
looking
carefully
about
him
and
sending
a
special
glance
up
the
lane
in
search
of
the
invalid
turkey
i
should
like
to
see
how
she
managed
it
he
told
himself
half
aloud
if
she
shows
a
gift
for
such
things
i
take
pains
to
teach
her
a
lesson
or
two
by
and
by
when
she
is
older
come
major
do
go
to
sleep
on
the
road
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
wagon
was
out
of
sight
if
the
reader
had
stood
in
the
thacher
lane
instead
of
following
the
good
man
farther
on
his
errand
of
mercy
and
good
fellowship
at
that
time
in
the
morning
most
housekeepers
were
busy
in
their
kitchens
but
thacher
came
to
stand
in
her
doorway
and
shaded
her
forehead
and
eyes
with
her
hand
from
the
bright
sunlight
as
she
looked
intently
across
the
pastures
toward
the
river
she
seemed
anxious
and
glanced
to
and
fro
across
the
fields
and
presently
she
turned
quickly
at
the
sound
of
a
footstep
and
saw
her
young
coming
from
the
other
direction
round
the
corner
of
the
house
the
child
was
wet
and
a
little
pale
though
she
evidently
had
been
running
what
have
you
been
doin
now
asked
the
old
lady
fretfully
i
have
you
gettin
up
in
the
mornin
before
i
am
awake
and
stealin
out
of
the
house
i
think

the
river
or

tree

said
the
little
girl
it
was
deep
though
and
she
began
to
cry
and
when
she
tried
to
cover
her
eyes
with
her
already
little
apron
she
felt
quite
and
unnerved
and
sat
down
dismally
on
the
doorstep
come
in
and
put
on
a
dry
dress
said
her
grandmother
not
unkindly
that
is
if

misery

schoolin
worth

grumbled
thacher
as
she
stepped
heavily
to
and
fro
in
the
kitchen
and
the
little
girl
disappeared
within
the
in
a
few
minutes
however
her
unusual
depression
was
driven
away
by
the
comfort
of
dry
garments
and
she
announced
triumphantly
that
she
had
found
a
whole
flock
of
young
wild
ducks
and
that
she
had
made
a
raft
and
chased
them
about
up
and
down
the
river
until
the
raft
had
proved
unseaworthy
and
she
had
fallen
through
into
the
water
later
in
the
day
somebody
came
from
the
jake
and
martin
homesteads
to
say
that
there
must
be
no
more
pulling
down
of
the
ends
of
the
pasture
fences
the
nails
had
easily
let
go
their
hold
of
the
old
boards
and
a
stone
had
served
our
heroine
for
a
useful
shipwright
hammer
but
the
young
cattle
had
strayed
through
these
broken
barriers
and
might
have
done
great
damage
if
they
had
been
discovered
a
little
later
having
quickly
hied
themselves
to
a
piece
of
carefully
cultivated
land
the
jake
and
martin
families
regarded
nan
with
a
mixture
of
dread
and
affection
she
was
bringing
a
new
element
into
their
prosaic
lives
and
her
pranks
afforded
them
a
bit
of
news
almost
daily
her
imagination
was
apt
to
busy
itself
in
inventing
tales
of
her
unknown
aunt
with
which
she
entertained
a
grandchild
of
martin
dyer
a
little
girl
of
nearly
her
own
age
it
seemed
possible
to
nan
that
any
day
a
carriage
drawn
by
a
pair
of
prancing
black
horses
might
be
seen
turning
up
the
lane
and
that
a
lovely
lady
might
alight
and
claim
her
as
her
only
niece
why
this
event
had
not
already
taken
place
the
child
never
troubled
herself
to
think
but
ever
since
marilla
had
spoken
of
this
aunt
existence
the
dreams
of
her
had
been
growing
longer
and
more
charming
until
she
seemed
fit
for
a
queen
and
her
unseen
house
a
palace
nan
playmate
took
pleasure
in
repeating
these
glowing
accounts
to
her
family
and
many
were
the
and
evil
forebodings
over
the
untruthfulness
of
the
heroine
of
this
story
little
susan
dyer
only
aunt
who
was
well
known
to
her
lived
as
other
people
did
in
a
comparatively
plain
and
humble
house
and
it
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
she
objected
to
hearing
continually
of
an
aunt
of
such
splendid
fashion
and
yet
nan
tried
over
and
over
again
to
be
in
some
degree
worthy
of
the
relationship
she
must
not
be
too
unfit
to
enter
upon
more
brilliant
surroundings
whenever
the
time
should
come
she
took
care
that
her
pet
chickens
and
her
one
doll
should
have
names
such
as
would
seem
proper
to
the
aunt
and
more
than
this
she
took
a
careful
survey
of
the
house
whenever
she
was
coming
home
from
school
or
from
play
lest
she
might
come
upon
her
distinguished
relative
unawares
she
had
asked
her
grandmother
more
than
once
to
tell
her
about
this
mysterious
kinswoman
but
thacher
proved
strangely
uncommunicative
fearing
if
she
answered
one
easy
question
it
might
involve
others
that
were
more
difficult
the
good
woman
grew
more
and
more
anxious
to
fulfil
her
duty
to
this
troublesome
young
housemate
the
child
was
strangely
dear
and
companionable
in
spite
of
her
frequent
naughtiness
it
seemed
too
as
if
she
could
do
whatever
she
undertook
and
as
if
she
had
a
power
which
made
her
able
to
use
and
unite
the
best
traits
of
her
ancestors
the
strong
capabilities
which
had
been
illy
balanced
or
allowed
to
run
to
waste
in
others
it
might
be
said
that
the
materials
for
a
fine
specimen
of
humanity
accumulate
through
several
generations
until
a
child
appears
who
is
the
heir
of
all
the
family
wit
and
attractiveness
and
common
sense
just
as
one
person
may
inherit
the
worldly
wealth
of
his
ancestry
vii
for
the
years
to
come
late
one
summer
afternoon
leslie
was
waked
from
an
unusually
long
nap
by
marilla
footsteps
along
the
hall
she
remained
standing
in
the
doorway
looking
at
him
for
a
provoking
length
of
time
and
finally
sneezed
in
her
most
obtrusive
and
violent
manner
at
this
he
sat
up
quickly
and
demanded
to
be
told
what
was
the
matter
adding
that
he
had
been
out
half
the
night
before
which
was
no
news
to
the
faithful
housekeeper
there
i
sure
i
did
mean
to
wake
you
up
she
said
with
an
apparent
lack
of
i
never
can
tell
whether
you
are
asleep
or
only
kind
of
drowsin
there
was
a
boy
here
just
now
from
old
mis
cunningham
over
on
the
spring
road
they
want
you
to
come
over
quick
as
convenient
she
do
know
nothin
the
boy
said
never
did
grumbled
the
doctor
i
go
toward
night
but
i
do
her
any
good
an
mis
thacher
is
out
here
waitin
too
but
she
says
if
you
busy
she
go
along
to
the
stores
and
stop
as
she
comes
back
she
looks
to
me
as
if
she
was
breakin
up
confided
marilla
in
a
lower
tone
tell
her
i
ready
now
answered
the
doctor
in
a
more
cordial
tone
and
though
he
said
half
to
himself
and
half
to
marilla
that
here
was
another
person
who
expected
him
to
cure
old
age
he
spoke
compassionately
and
as
if
his
heart
were
heavy
with
the
thought
of
human
sorrow
and
suffering
but
he
greeted
thacher
most
cheerfully
and
joked
about
marilla
fear
of
a
fly
as
he
threw
open
the
blinds
of
the
study
window
which
was
best
shaded
from
the
sun
thacher
did
indeed
look
changed
and
the
physician
quick
eyes
took
note
of
it
and
as
he
gathered
up
some
letters
and
newspapers
which
had
been
strewn
about
just
after
dinner
he
said
kindly
that
he
hoped
she
had
no
need
of
a
doctor
it
was
plain
that
the
occasion
seemed
an
uncommon
one
to
her
she
wore
her
best
clothes
which
would
not
have
been
necessary
for
one
of
her
usual
business
trips
to
the
village
and
it
seemed
to
be
difficult
for
her
to
begin
her
story
leslie
taking
a
purely
professional
view
of
the
case
began
to
consider
what
form
of
tonic
would
be
most
suitable
whether
she
had
come
to
ask
for
one
or
not
i
want
to
have
a
good
talk
with
you
about
the
little
gell
nanny
you
know
she
said
at
last
and
the
doctor
nodded
and
explaining
that
there
seemed
to
be
a
good
deal
of
draught
through
the
room
crossed
the
floor
and
gently
shut
the
door
which
opened
into
the
hall
he
smiled
a
little
as
he
did
it
having
heard
the
long
breath
outside
which
was
the
not
unfamiliar
signal
of
marilla
presence
if
she
were
curious
she
was
a
discreet
keeper
of
secrets
and
the
doctor
had
more
than
once
indulged
her
in
her
sinful
listening
by
way
of
friendliness
and
reward
but
this
subject
promised
to
concern
his
own
affairs
too
closely
and
he
became
wary
of
the
presence
of
another
pair
of
ears
he
was
naturally
a
man
of
uncommon
reserve
and
most
loyal
in
keeping
his
patients
secrets
if
clergymen
knew
their
congregations
as
well
as
physicians
do
the
sermons
would
be
often
more
closely
related
to
the
parish
needs
it
was
difficult
for
the
world
to
understand
why
when
leslie
was
anything
but
prone
to
gossip
marilla
should
have
been
possessed
of
such
a
wealth
of
knowledge
of
her
affairs
strange
to
say
this
wealth
was
for
her
own
miserly
pleasure
and
not
to
be
distributed
and
while
she
often
proclaimed
with
exasperating
triumph
that
she
had
known
for
months
some
truth
just
discovered
by
others
she
was
regarded
by
her
acquaintances
as
if
she
were
a
dictionary
written
in
some
foreign
language
immensely
valuable
but
of
no
practical
use
to
themselves
it
was
sometimes
difficult
not
to
make
an
attempt
to
borrow
from
her
store
of
news
but
nothing
delighted
her
more
than
to
be
so
approached
and
to
present
impenetrable
barriers
of
discretion
to
the
enemy
how
is
nanny
getting
on
the
doctor
asked
she
looks
stronger
than
she
did
a
year
ago
dear
me
she
wild
as
ever
answered
thacher
trying
to
smile
but
i
been
distressed
about
her
lately
night
and
day
i
thought
perhaps
i
might
see
you
going
by
she
gettin
to
be
a
great
girl
doctor
and
i
ai
fit
to
cope
with
her
i
find
my
and
i
old
before
my
time
all
my
folks
was
rugged
and
sound
long
past
my
age
but
i
had
my
troubles
you
do
need
i
should
tell
you
that
poor
always
give
me
a
feelin
as
if
i
was
a
hen
that
has
hatched
ducks
i
never
knew
exactly
how
to
do
for
her
she
seemed
to
see
everything
so
different
and
lord
only
knows
how
i
worry
about
her
and
did
thinkin
if
i
seen
clearer
how
to
do
my
duty
her
life
might
have
come
out
sort
of
better
and
it
the
same
with
little
anna
not
that
she
so
prone
to
evil
as
some
she
a
child
if
ever
one
was
born
but
she
a
piece
mischief
and
it
may
come
from
her
father
folks
and
their
ways
livin
but
she
made
o
different
stuff
and
i
ai
fit
to
make
answer
for
her
or
for
fetchin
of
her
up
i
come
to
ask
if
you
kindly
advise
what
best
for
her
i
do
know
anything
got
to
be
done
for
a
good
spell
yet
i
mind
what
you
say
about
lettin
her
run
and
git
strong
and
i
do
check
her
only
it
seemed
to
me
that
you
might
want
to
speak
about
her
sometimes
and
not
do
it
for
fear
wronging
my
judgment
i
declare
i
have
no
judgment
about
reasonable
for
her
and
you
her
guardeen
and
there
the
money
her
father
sister
has
sent
her
would
burn
my
fingers
to
touch
a
cent
of
it
but
by
and
by
if
you
think
she
ought
to
have
schoolin
or
anything
else
you
must
just
say
so
i
think
nothing
better
could
have
been
done
for
the
child
than
you
have
done
said
leslie
warmly
do
worry
yourself
my
good
friend
as
for
books
she
will
take
to
them
of
her
own
accord
quite
soon
enough
and
in
such
weather
as
this
i
think
one
day
in
the
fields
is
worth
five
in
the
i
do
the
best
i
can
for
her
thacher
errand
had
not
yet
been
told
though
she
fumbled
in
her
pocket
and
walked
to
the
open
window
to
look
for
the
neighbor
wagon
by
which
she
was
to
find
conveyance
home
before
she
ventured
to
say
anything
more
i
do
know
my
time
come
for
some
years
yet
she
said
at
length
falteringly
but
i
have
had
it
borne
in
upon
my
mind
a
good
many
ways
this
summer
that
i
ai
going
to
stay
here
a
while
i
been
troubled
considerable
by
the
same
complaints
that
carried
my
mother
off
and
i
built
just
like
her
i
do
feel
no
concern
for
myself
but
it
goin
to
leave
the
child
without
anybody
of
her
own
to
look
to
there
plenty
will
befriend
her
just
so
long
as
she
got
means
and
the
old
farm
will
sell
for
something
besides
what
she
got
already
but
that
ai
everything
and
i
seem
to
make
up
my
mind
to
havin
of
her
boarded
about
if
was
so
your
wife
had
lived
i
should
know
what
i
go
down
on
my
knees
to
her
to
do
but
i
ca
ask
it
of
you
to
be
burdened
with
a
young
child
up
the
doctor
listened
patiently
though
just
before
this
he
had
risen
and
begun
to
fill
a
small
bottle
at
the
closet
shelves
which
were
stocked
close
to
their
perilous
edges
with
various
drugs
without
turning
to
look
at
his
patient
he
said
i
wish
you
would
take
five
or
six
drops
of
this
three
times
a
day
and
let
me
see
you
again
within
a
week
or
two
and
while
the
troubled
woman
turned
to
look
at
him
with
he
added
do
give
yourself
another
thought
about
little
nan
if
anything
should
happen
to
you
i
shall
be
glad
to
bring
her
here
and
to
take
care
of
her
as
if
she
were
my
own
i
always
have
liked
her
and
it
will
be
as
good
for
me
as
for
her
i
would
not
promise
it
for
any
other
child
but
if
you
had
not
spoken
i
should
have
found
a
way
to
arrange
with
you
the
first
chance
that
came
but
i
getting
to
be
an
old
fellow
myself
he
laughed
i
suppose
if
i
get
through
first
you
will
be
friendly
to
marilla
and
thacher
let
a
faint
sunbeam
of
a
smile
shine
out
from
the
depths
of
the
handkerchief
with
which
she
was
trying
to
stop
a
great
shower
of
tears
marilla
was
not
without
her
little
vanities
and
being
thought
youthful
was
one
of
the
chief
desires
of
her
heart
so
thacher
went
away
lighter
hearted
than
she
came
she
asked
the
price
of
the
vial
of
medicine
and
was
answered
that
they
would
talk
about
that
another
time
then
there
was
a
little
sober
joking
about
certain
patients
who
never
paid
their
doctor
bills
at
all
because
of
a
superstition
that
they
would
immediately
require
his
aid
again
leslie
stood
in
his
study
doorway
and
watched
her
drive
down
the
street
with
martin
dyer
it
seemed
to
him
only
a
year
or
two
since
both
the
man
and
woman
had
been
strong
and
vigorous
now
they
both
looked
shrunken
and
there
was
a
wornness
and
feebleness
about
the
bodies
which
had
done
such
good
service
come
and
go
said
the
doctor
to
himself
one
generation
after
another
getting
old
all
the
good
people
on
the
farms
i
never
shall
care
so
much
to
be
at
the
beck
and
call
of
their
grandchildren
but
i
must
mend
up
these
old
folks
and
do
the
best
i
can
for
them
as
long
as
they
stay
they
good
friends
to
me
dear
me
how
it
used
to
fret
me
when
i
was
younger
to
hear
them
always
talking
about
old
doctor
wayland
and
what
he
used
to
do
and
here
i
am
the
old
doctor
myself
and
then
he
went
down
the
gravel
walk
toward
the
stable
with
a
quick
firm
step
which
many
a
younger
man
might
have
envied
to
ask
for
a
horse
you
may
saddle
him
he
directed
i
am
only
going
to
old
cunningham
and
it
is
a
cool
afternoon
leslie
had
ridden
less
and
less
every
year
of
his
practice
but
for
some
reason
best
known
to
himself
he
went
down
the
village
street
at
a
mad
pace
indeed
almost
everybody
who
saw
him
felt
that
it
was
important
to
go
to
the
next
house
to
ask
if
it
were
known
for
what
accident
or
desperate
emergency
he
had
been
called
away
viii
a
great
change
until
the
autumn
of
this
year
life
had
seemed
to
flow
in
one
steady
unchanging
current
the
thought
had
not
entered
little
nan
head
that
changes
might
be
in
store
for
her
for
ever
since
she
could
remember
the
events
of
life
had
followed
each
other
quietly
and
except
for
the
differences
in
work
and
play
caused
by
the
succession
of
the
seasons
she
was
not
called
upon
to
accommodate
herself
to
new
conditions
it
was
a
gentle
change
at
first
as
the
days
grew
shorter
and
the
house
and
cellar
were
being
made
ready
for
winter
her
grandmother
seemed
to
have
much
more
to
do
than
usual
and
nan
must
stay
at
home
to
help
she
was
growing
older
at
any
rate
she
knew
how
to
help
better
than
she
used
she
was
anxious
to
show
her
grandmother
how
well
she
could
work
and
as
the
river
side
and
the
windy
pastures
grew
less
hospitable
she
did
not
notice
that
she
was
no
longer
encouraged
to
go
out
to
play
for
hours
together
to
amuse
herself
as
best
she
might
and
at
any
rate
keep
out
of
the
way
it
seemed
natural
enough
now
that
she
should
stay
in
the
house
and
be
entrusted
with
some
regular
part
of
the
business
of
keeping
it
for
some
time
thacher
had
kept
but
one
cow
and
early
in
november
after
a
good
offer
for
old
brindle
had
been
accepted
it
was
announced
to
nan
surprise
that
the
young
cow
which
was
to
be
successor
need
not
be
bought
until
spring
she
would
be
a
great
care
in
winter
time
and
nan
was
to
bring
a
quart
of
milk
a
day
from
jake
and
martin
this
did
not
seem
an
unpleasant
duty
while
the
mild
weather
lasted
if
there
came
a
rainy
day
one
of
the
kind
neighbors
would
leave
the
little
pail
on
his
way
to
the
village
before
the
young
messenger
had
started
out
nan
could
not
exactly
understand
at
last
why
jake
and
martin
always
asked
about
her
grandmother
every
morning
with
so
much
interest
and
curiosity
or
why
they
came
oftener
and
oftener
to
help
with
the
heavy
work
thacher
had
never
before
minded
her
occasional
illnesses
so
much
and
some
time
passed
before
nan
inexperienced
eyes
and
fearless
young
heart
understood
that
the
whole
atmosphere
which
overhung
the
landscape
of
her
life
had
somehow
changed
that
another
winter
approached
full
of
mystery
and
strangeness
and
discomfort
of
mind
and
at
last
a
great
storm
was
almost
ready
to
break
into
the
shelter
and
comfort
of
her
simple
life
poor
nan
she
could
not
think
what
it
all
meant
she
was
asked
many
a
distressing
question
and
openly
pitied
and
heard
her
future
discussed
as
if
her
world
might
come
to
an
end
any
day
the
doctor
had
visited
her
grandmother
from
time
to
time
but
always
while
she
was
at
school
until
vacation
came
and
poor
thacher
grew
too
feeble
to
enter
into
even
a
part
of
the
usual
business
of
the
farmhouse
one
morning
as
nan
was
coming
back
from
the
dyer
farm
with
the
milk
she
met
meeker
in
the
highway
this
neighbor
and
our
heroine
were
rarely
on
good
terms
with
each
other
since
nan
had
usually
laid
herself
under
some
serious
charge
of
and
had
come
to
believe
that
she
would
be
disapproved
in
any
event
and
so
might
enjoy
life
as
she
chose
and
revel
in
harmless
malice
the
child
could
not
have
told
why
she
shrank
from
meeting
her
enemy
so
much
more
than
usual
and
tried
to
discover
some
refuge
or
chance
for
escape
but
as
it
was
an
open
bit
of
the
road
and
a
straight
way
to
the
lane
she
could
have
no
excuse
for
scrambling
over
the
stone
wall
and
cutting
short
the
distance
however
her
second
thought
scorned
the
idea
of
running
away
in
such
cowardly
fashion
and
not
having
any
recent
misdemeanor
on
her
conscience
she
went
forward
unflinchingly
meeker
tone
was
not
one
of
complaint
but
of
pity
and
insinuating
friendliness
how
your
grandma
she
asked
and
nan
with
an
unsympathetic
answer
of
about
the
same
stepped
bravely
forward
resenting
with
all
her
young
soul
the
discovery
that
meeker
had
turned
and
was
walking
alongside
she
been
a
good
kind
grandma
to
you
hai
she
said
this
unwelcome
companion
and
when
nan
had
returned
a
wondering
but
almost
inaudible
assent
she
continued
she
be
a
great
loss
to
you
i
can
tell
you
you
never
find
nobody
to
do
for
you
like
her
there
you
wo
realize
nothing
about
it
till
you
got
you
be
now
but
the
time
come
when
and
her
sharp
voice
faltered
for
nan
had
turned
to
look
full
in
her
face
had
stopped
still
in
the
frozen
road
dropped
the
pail
unconsciously
and
given
a
little
cry
and
in
another
moment
was
running
as
a
chased
wild
creature
does
toward
the
refuge
of
its
nest
the
doctor
horse
was
fastened
at
the
head
of
the
lane
and
nan
knew
at
last
what
any
one
in
the
neighborhood
could
have
told
her
many
days
before
that
her
grandmother
was
going
to
die
meeker
stared
after
her
with
a
grieved
sense
of
the
abrupt
ending
of
the
coveted
interview
then
she
recovered
her
and
picking
up
the
forsaken
pail
stepped
lightly
over
the
ruts
and
frozen
puddles
following
nan
eagerly
in
the
hope
of
witnessing
more
of
such
extraordinary
behavior
and
with
the
design
of
offering
her
services
as
watcher
or
nurse
in
these
last
hours
at
any
rate
the
pail
and
the
milk
which
had
not
been
spilt
could
not
be
left
in
the
road
so
the
first
chapter
of
the
child
life
was
ended
in
the
early
winter
weather
there
was
a
new
unsheltered
grave
on
the
slope
above
the
river
the
door
was
shut
and
locked
and
the
light
was
out
in
the
kitchen
window
it
had
been
a
landmark
to
those
who
were
used
to
driving
along
the
road
by
night
and
there
were
sincere
mourners
for
the
kindly
woman
who
had
kept
a
simple
faith
and
uprightness
all
through
her
long
life
of
trouble
and
disappointment
nan
and
the
cat
had
gone
to
live
in
the
village
and
both
being
young
had
taken
the
change
with
serenity
though
at
first
a
piteous
sorrow
had
been
waked
in
the
child
heart
a
keen
and
dreadful
fear
of
the
future
the
past
seemed
so
secure
and
pleasant
as
she
looked
back
and
now
she
was
in
the
power
of
a
fateful
future
which
had
begun
with
something
like
a
whirlwind
that
had
swept
over
her
leaving
nothing
unchanged
it
seemed
to
her
that
this
was
to
be
incessant
and
that
being
grown
up
was
to
be
at
the
mercy
of
sorrow
and
uncertainty
she
was
pale
and
quiet
during
her
last
days
in
the
old
home
answering
questions
and
obeying
directions
mechanically
but
usually
sitting
in
the
least
visited
part
of
the
kitchen
watching
the
neighbors
as
they
examined
her
grandmother
possessions
and
properly
disposed
of
the
contents
of
the
house
sometimes
a
spark
flew
from
her
sad
and
angry
eyes
but
she
made
no
trouble
and
seemed
dull
and
indifferent
late
in
the
evening
leslie
carried
her
home
with
him
through
the
first
heavy
of
the
year
and
between
the
excitement
of
being
covered
from
the
flakes
and
so
making
a
journey
in
the
dark
and
of
keeping
hold
of
the
basket
which
contained
the
enraged
kitten
the
grief
at
leaving
home
was
not
dwelt
upon
when
she
had
been
unwound
from
one
of
the
doctor
great
cloaks
and
her
eyes
had
grown
used
to
the
bright
light
in
the
and
marilla
had
said
that
supper
had
been
waiting
half
an
hour
and
she
did
not
know
how
she
should
get
along
with
a
black
cat
and
then
bustled
about
talking
much
faster
than
usual
because
the
sight
of
the
lonely
child
had
made
her
ready
to
cry
nan
began
to
feel
comforted
it
seemed
a
great
while
ago
that
she
had
cried
at
her
funeral
if
this
were
the
future
it
was
certainly
very
welcome
and
already
very
dear
and
the
time
of
distress
was
like
a
night
of
bad
dreams
between
two
pleasant
days
it
will
easily
be
understood
that
no
great
change
was
made
in
leslie
house
the
doctor
himself
and
marilla
were
both
well
settled
in
their
habits
and
while
they
cordially
made
room
for
the
little
girl
who
was
to
be
the
third
member
of
the
household
her
coming
made
little
difference
to
either
of
her
elders
there
was
a
great
deal
of
illness
that
winter
and
the
doctor
was
more
than
commonly
busy
nan
was
sent
to
school
and
discovered
the
delight
of
reading
one
stormy
day
when
her
guardian
had
given
her
leave
to
stay
at
home
and
she
had
found
his
own
old
copy
of
robinson
crusoe
looking
most
friendly
and
inviting
in
a
corner
of
one
of
the
study
shelves
as
for
school
she
had
never
liked
it
and
the
village
school
gave
her
far
greater
misery
than
the
building
at
the
ever
had
done
she
had
known
many
of
the
village
children
by
sight
from
seeing
them
in
church
but
she
did
not
number
many
friends
among
them
even
after
the
winter
was
nearly
gone
and
the
days
began
to
grow
brighter
and
less
cold
and
the
games
were
a
source
of
great
merriment
in
the
playground
nan
ideas
of
life
were
quite
unlike
those
held
by
these
new
acquaintances
and
she
could
not
gain
the
least
interest
in
most
of
the
other
children
though
she
grew
fond
of
one
boy
who
was
a
famous
rover
and
fisherman
and
after
one
of
the
elder
girls
had
read
a
composition
which
fired
our
heroine
imagination
she
worshiped
this
superior
being
from
a
suitable
distance
and
was
her
willing
adorer
and
slave
the
composition
was
upon
the
moon
and
when
the
author
proclaimed
the
fact
that
this
was
the
same
moon
which
had
looked
down
upon
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
little
nan
eyes
had
opened
wide
with
reverence
and
awe
and
she
opened
the
doors
of
her
heart
and
soul
to
lofty
thought
and
high
imagination
the
big
girl
who
sat
in
the
back
seat
and
glibly
recited
amazing
lessons
in
history
and
did
sums
which
entirely
covered
the
one
small
blackboard
was
not
unmindful
of
nan
admiration
and
stolidly
accepted
and
munched
the
offerings
of
cracked
nuts
or
of
the
treasured
english
apples
which
had
been
brought
from
the
farm
and
kept
like
a
hoard
in
an
archway
of
the
cellar
by
themselves
nan
cherished
an
idea
of
going
back
to
the
farm
to
live
by
herself
as
soon
as
she
grew
a
little
older
and
she
indulged
in
pleasing
of
a
most
charming
life
there
with
frequent
entertainments
for
her
friends
at
which
the
author
of
the
information
about
the
moon
would
be
the
favored
guest
and
nan
herself
in
a
most
childish
and
provincial
fashion
the
reigning
queen
what
did
these
new
know
of
the
strawberries
which
grew
in
the
bit
of
meadow
or
the
great
blackberries
by
one
of
the
pasture
walls
and
what
would
their
pleasure
be
when
they
were
taken
down
the
river
some
moonlight
night
and
caught
sight
of
a
fire
blazing
on
a
distant
bank
and
went
nearer
to
find
a
sumptuous
feast
which
nan
herself
had
arranged
she
had
been
told
that
her
aunt
that
mysterious
and
beneficent
aunt
had
already
sent
her
money
which
was
lying
idle
in
the
bank
until
she
should
need
to
spend
it
and
her
imaginary
riches
increased
week
by
week
while
her
horizon
of
future
happiness
constantly
grew
wider
the
other
children
were
not
unwilling
at
first
to
enter
upon
an
inquisitive
friendship
with
the
but
marilla
was
so
uncongenial
to
the
noisy
visitors
and
so
fastidious
in
the
matter
of
snowy
and
muddy
shoes
that
she
was
soon
avoided
nan
herself
was
a
teachable
child
and
gave
little
trouble
and
marilla
sometimes
congratulated
herself
because
she
had
reserved
the
violent
objections
which
had
occurred
to
her
mind
when
the
doctor
had
announced
just
before
thacher
death
that
his
ward
would
henceforth
find
a
home
in
his
house
marilla
usually
sat
in
the
in
the
evening
though
she
was
apt
to
visit
the
study
occasionally
knitting
in
hand
to
give
her
opinions
or
to
acquaint
herself
with
various
events
of
which
she
thought
the
doctor
would
be
likely
to
have
knowledge
sometimes
in
the
colder
winter
nights
she
drew
a
convenient
close
beside
the
kitchen
stove
and
refused
to
wander
far
from
such
comfortable
warmth
now
that
she
had
nan
busy
feet
to
cover
there
was
less
danger
than
ever
that
she
should
be
left
without
and
she
deeply
enjoyed
the
child
company
since
nan
could
give
innocent
answers
to
many
questions
which
could
never
be
put
to
elder
members
of
the
dyer
and
thacher
neighborhood
meeker
was
apt
to
be
discussed
with
great
freedom
and
nan
told
long
stories
about
her
own
childish
experiences
which
were
listened
to
and
encouraged
and
matched
with
others
even
longer
and
more
circumstantial
by
marilla
the
doctor
who
was
always
reading
when
he
could
find
a
quiet
hour
for
himself
often
smiled
as
he
heard
the
steady
sound
of
voices
from
the
wide
kitchen
and
he
more
than
once
took
a
few
careful
steps
into
the
and
stood
there
shaking
with
laughter
at
the
character
of
the
conversation
nan
though
eager
to
learn
and
curious
about
many
things
in
life
and
nature
at
first
found
her
school
lessons
difficult
and
sometimes
came
appealingly
to
him
for
assistance
when
circumstances
had
made
a
temporary
ending
of
her
total
indifference
to
getting
the
lessons
at
all
for
this
and
other
reasons
she
sometimes
sought
the
study
and
drew
a
small
chair
beside
the
doctor
large
one
before
the
blazing
fire
of
the
black
birch
logs
and
then
marilla
in
her
turn
would
venture
upon
the
neutral
ground
between
study
and
kitchen
and
smile
with
satisfaction
at
the
cheerful
companionship
of
the
tired
man
and
the
idle
little
girl
who
had
already
found
her
way
to
his
lonely
heart
nan
had
come
to
another
home
there
was
no
question
about
what
should
be
done
with
her
and
for
her
but
she
was
made
free
of
the
silent
old
house
and
went
on
growing
taller
and
growing
dearer
and
growing
happier
day
by
day
whatever
the
future
might
bring
she
would
be
sure
to
look
back
with
love
and
longing
to
the
first
summer
of
her
village
life
when
seeing
that
she
looked
pale
and
drooping
the
doctor
to
her
intense
gratification
took
her
away
from
school
presently
instead
of
having
a
ride
out
into
the
country
as
an
occasional
favor
she
might
be
seen
every
day
by
the
doctor
side
as
if
he
could
not
make
his
morning
rounds
without
her
and
in
and
out
of
the
she
went
following
him
like
a
little
dog
or
as
marilla
scornfully
expressed
it
a
briar
at
his
heels
sitting
soberly
by
when
he
dealt
his
medicines
and
gave
advice
listening
to
his
wise
and
merry
talk
with
some
and
his
helpful
advice
and
consolation
to
others
of
the
country
people
many
of
these
acquaintances
treated
nan
with
great
kindness
she
half
belonged
to
them
and
was
deeply
interesting
for
the
sake
of
her
other
ties
of
blood
and
bonds
of
fortune
while
she
took
their
courtesy
with
thankfulness
and
their
lack
of
notice
with
composure
if
there
were
a
shiny
apple
offered
she
was
glad
but
if
not
she
did
not
miss
it
since
her
chief
delight
was
in
being
the
doctor
assistant
and
attendant
and
her
eyes
were
always
watching
for
chances
when
she
might
be
of
use
and
one
day
coming
out
from
a
bedroom
the
doctor
discovered
to
his
amusement
that
her
quick
and
careful
fingers
had
folded
the
papers
of
some
powders
which
he
had
left
unfolded
on
the
table
as
they
drove
home
together
in
the
bright
noon
sunshine
he
said
as
if
the
question
were
asked
for
the
sake
of
joking
a
little
what
are
you
going
to
do
when
you
grow
up
nan
to
which
she
answered
gravely
as
if
it
were
the
one
great
question
of
her
life
i
should
like
best
to
be
a
doctor
strangely
enough
there
flitted
through
the
doctor
mind
a
remembrance
of
the
day
when
he
had
talked
with
meeker
and
had
looked
up
the
lane
to
see
the
unlucky
turkey
whose
leg
had
been
put
into
splints
he
had
wished
more
than
once
that
he
had
taken
pains
to
see
how
the
child
had
managed
it
but
old
thacher
had
reported
the
case
to
have
been
at
least
partially
successful
nan
had
stolen
a
look
at
her
companion
after
the
answer
had
been
given
but
had
been
pleased
and
comforted
to
find
that
he
was
not
laughing
at
her
and
at
once
began
a
lively
picture
of
becoming
famous
in
her
chosen
profession
and
the
valued
partner
of
leslie
whose
skill
everybody
praised
so
heartily
he
should
not
go
out
at
night
and
she
would
help
him
so
much
that
he
would
wonder
how
he
ever
had
been
able
to
manage
his
practice
alone
it
was
a
matter
of
no
concern
to
her
that
marilla
had
laughed
when
she
had
been
told
of
nan
intentions
and
had
spoken
disrespectfully
of
women
doctors
and
the
child
heart
was
full
of
pride
and
hope
the
doctor
stopped
his
horse
suddenly
to
show
nan
some
flowers
which
grew
at
the
roadside
some
brilliant
cardinals
and
she
climbed
quickly
down
to
gather
them
there
was
an
unwritten
law
that
they
should
keep
watch
one
to
the
right
hand
and
the
other
to
the
left
and
such
treasures
of
blossoms
or
wild
fruit
seldom
escaped
nan
vision
now
she
felt
as
if
she
had
been
wrong
to
let
her
thoughts
go
wandering
and
her
cheeks
were
almost
as
bright
as
the
scarlet
flowers
themselves
as
she
clambered
back
to
the
wagon
seat
but
the
doctor
was
in
deep
thought
and
had
nothing
more
to
say
for
the
next
mile
or
two
it
had
become
like
a
day
suddenly
and
without
apparent
reason
but
nan
had
no
suspicion
that
she
was
the
patient
in
charge
whose
welfare
seemed
to
the
doctor
to
be
dependent
upon
his
own
decisions
ix
at
that
evening
leslie
made
signs
that
he
was
not
to
be
interrupted
and
even
shut
the
study
doors
to
which
precaution
he
seldom
resorted
he
was
evidently
disturbed
when
an
hour
later
a
vigorous
knocking
was
heard
at
the
front
entrance
and
marilla
ushered
in
with
anything
but
triumph
an
elderly
gentleman
who
had
been
his
college
classmate
marilla
countenance
wore
a
forbidding
expression
and
as
she
withdrew
she
took
pains
to
shut
the
door
between
the
hall
and
with
considerable
violence
it
was
almost
never
closed
under
ordinary
circumstances
but
the
faithful
housekeeper
was
impelled
to
express
her
wrath
in
some
way
and
this
was
the
first
that
offered
itself
nan
was
sitting
peacefully
in
the
kitchen
playing
with
her
black
cat
and
telling
herself
stories
no
doubt
and
was
quite
unprepared
for
marilla
change
of
temper
the
bell
for
the
friday
evening
was
tolling
its
last
strokes
and
it
was
marilla
habit
to
attend
that
service
she
was
apt
to
be
kept
closely
at
home
it
must
be
acknowledged
and
this
was
one
of
her
few
social
indulgences
since
nan
had
joined
the
family
and
proved
that
she
could
be
trusted
with
a
message
she
had
been
left
in
charge
of
the
house
during
this
coveted
hour
on
friday
evenings
marilla
had
descended
from
her
room
arrayed
for
church
going
but
now
her
bonnet
was
pulled
off
as
if
that
were
the
prime
offender
and
when
the
child
looked
wonderingly
around
the
kitchen
she
saw
the
brought
out
from
the
closet
and
put
down
very
hard
on
a
table
while
marilla
began
directly
afterward
to
rattle
at
the
stove
i
like
to
say
to
some
folks
that
we
do
keep
hotel
grumbled
the
good
woman
i
wish
to
my
heart
i
stepped
right
out
o
the
front
door
and
gone
straight
to
meetin
and
left
them
there
beholdin
of
me
course
he
has
had
no
supper
nor
dinner
neither
like
not
and
if
men
are
ever
going
to
drop
down
on
a
family
unexpected
it
always
friday
night
when
everything
eat
up
that
ever
was
in
the
house
i
after
i
bake
double
quantities
mornin
he
be
drivin
off
before
and
treasure
it
up
that
we
never
have
nothin
decent
to
set
before
folks
anna
you
got
to
stir
yourself
and
help
while
i
get
the
fire
started
up
lay
one
o
them
big
dinner
napkins
over
the
red
cloth
and
set
a
plate
an
a
for
as
for
laying
the
whole
table
over
again
i
wo
and
i
sha
there
water
to
cart
upstairs
and
the
to
open
but
heaven
be
thanked
i
was
up
there
dustin
and
if
ever
you
set
a
mug
of
flowers
into
one
o
the
again
and
leave
it
there
a
week
or
ten
days
to
spile
i
speak
about
it
to
the
doctor
now
you
step
out
o
my
way
like
a
good
girl
i
do
know
whether
you
or
the
cat
the
worst
for
gettin
before
me
when
i
in
a
drive
i
set
him
out
somethin
to
eat
and
then
i
goin
to
meetin
if
the
skies
fall
nan
meekly
obeyed
directions
and
with
a
sense
of
guilt
concerning
the
deserted
posies
went
to
hover
about
the
study
door
after
the
plates
were
arranged
instead
of
braving
further
the
stormy
atmosphere
of
the
kitchen
marilla
lamp
had
shone
in
so
that
there
had
been
light
enough
in
the
but
the
study
was
quite
dark
except
where
there
was
one
spark
at
the
end
of
the
doctor
cigar
which
was
alternately
dim
and
bright
like
the
revolving
lantern
of
a
lighthouse
at
that
moment
the
smoker
rose
and
with
his
most
considerate
and
conciliatory
tone
asked
marilla
for
the
study
lamp
but
nan
heard
and
ran
on
tiptoe
and
presently
brought
it
in
from
the
kitchen
holding
it
carefully
with
both
hands
and
walking
slowly
she
apparently
had
no
thought
beyond
her
errand
but
she
was
brimful
of
eagerness
to
see
the
unexpected
guest
for
guests
were
by
no
means
frequent
and
since
she
had
really
become
aware
of
a
great
outside
world
beyond
the
boundaries
of
oldfields
she
welcomed
the
sight
of
any
messengers
leslie
hastily
pushed
away
some
books
from
the
lamp
place
and
noticing
that
his
visitor
looked
at
nan
with
surprise
quickly
explained
that
this
little
girl
had
come
to
take
care
of
him
and
bade
nan
speak
to
ferris
whereupon
her
bravery
was
sorely
tried
but
not
overcome
and
afterward
she
sat
down
in
her
own
little
chair
quite
prepared
to
be
hospitable
as
she
heard
a
sound
of
water
being
poured
into
a
pitcher
in
the
best
room
upstairs
she
was
ready
to
laugh
if
there
had
been
anybody
to
laugh
with
and
presently
marilla
appeared
at
the
door
with
the
announcement
that
there
was
some
tea
waiting
in
the
after
which
and
before
anybody
had
thought
of
moving
the
side
gate
clacked
resolutely
and
marilla
looking
more
prim
and
unruffled
than
usual
sped
forth
to
the
enjoyment
of
her
friday
evening
privileges
nan
followed
the
gentlemen
to
the
not
knowing
whether
she
were
wanted
or
not
but
feeling
quite
assured
when
it
was
ascertained
that
neither
sugar
nor
teaspoons
had
been
provided
the
little
feast
looked
somewhat
meagre
and
the
doctor
spoke
irreverently
of
his
housekeeper
and
proceeded
to
abstract
a
jar
of
her
best
strawberry
jam
from
the
convenient
and
to
collect
other
articles
of
food
which
seemed
to
him
to
be
inviting
however
inappropriate
to
the
occasion
the
guest
would
have
none
of
the
jam
but
leslie
cut
a
slice
of
the
loaf
of
bread
for
himself
and
one
for
nan
though
it
had
already
waned
beyond
its
last
quarter
and
nobody
knew
what
would
happen
if
there
were
no
toast
at
breakfast
time
marilla
would
never
know
what
a
waste
of
jam
was
spread
upon
these
slices
either
but
she
was
a
miser
only
with
the
best
preserves
and
so
our
friends
reveled
in
their
stolen
pleasure
and
were
as
merry
together
as
heart
could
wish
nan
thought
it
very
strange
when
she
found
that
the
doctor
and
his
guest
had
been
at
school
together
for
the
stranger
seemed
so
old
and
worn
they
were
talking
about
other
classmates
at
first
and
she
sat
still
to
listen
until
the
hour
of
marilla
return
drew
near
and
leslie
prudently
returned
to
his
own
uninvaded
apartment
nan
was
told
to
her
sorrow
that
it
was
past
her
and
as
she
stopped
to
say
candle
in
hand
a
few
moments
afterward
the
doctor
stooped
to
kiss
her
with
unusual
tenderness
and
a
little
later
when
she
was
safe
in
her
small
bedroom
and
under
the
coverlet
which
was
marilla
glory
having
been
knit
the
winter
before
in
an
intricate
pattern
she
almost
shook
with
fear
at
the
sound
of
its
vengeful
footsteps
in
the
lower
room
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
influence
of
the
meeting
had
been
very
good
and
that
one
of
its
attendants
had
come
home
equal
to
great
demands
upon
her
fortitude
and
patience
nan
could
not
help
wishing
she
had
thought
to
put
away
the
jam
and
she
wondered
how
marilla
would
treat
them
all
in
the
morning
but
to
do
that
worthy
woman
justice
she
was
mild
and
considerate
and
outdid
herself
in
the
breakfast
that
was
set
forth
in
the
honor
and
ferris
thought
he
could
do
no
less
than
to
add
to
his
morning
greeting
the
question
why
she
was
not
growing
old
like
the
rest
of
them
which
though
not
answered
was
pleasantly
received
the
host
and
guest
talked
very
late
the
night
before
and
told
each
other
many
things
leslie
had
somewhat
unwillingly
undertaken
the
country
practice
which
had
grown
dearer
to
him
with
every
year
but
there
were
family
reasons
why
he
had
decided
to
stay
in
oldfields
for
a
few
months
at
least
and
though
it
was
not
long
before
he
was
left
alone
not
only
by
the
father
and
mother
whose
only
child
he
was
but
by
his
wife
and
child
he
felt
less
and
less
inclination
to
break
the
old
ties
and
transplant
himself
to
some
more
prominent
position
of
the
medical
world
the
leisure
he
often
had
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
was
spent
in
the
studies
which
always
delighted
him
and
little
by
little
he
gained
great
repute
among
his
professional
brethren
he
was
a
scholar
and
a
thinker
in
other
than
medical
philosophies
and
most
persons
who
knew
anything
of
him
thought
it
a
pity
that
he
should
be
burying
himself
alive
as
they
were
pleased
to
term
his
devotion
to
his
provincial
life
his
rare
excursions
to
the
cities
gave
more
pleasure
to
other
men
than
to
himself
however
in
these
later
years
and
he
laughingly
proclaimed
himself
to
be
growing
rusty
and
behind
the
times
to
ferris
who
smiled
indulgently
and
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
contradict
so
untrue
and
preposterous
an
assertion
if
one
man
had
been
a
stayer
at
home
a
vegetable
nature
as
leslie
had
gone
on
to
say
which
has
no
power
to
change
its
locality
or
to
better
itself
by
choosing
another
and
more
adequate
or
stimulating
soil
the
other
had
developed
the
opposite
extreme
of
character
being
by
nature
a
rover
from
the
medical
school
he
had
entered
at
once
upon
the
duties
of
a
naval
appointment
and
after
he
had
become
impatient
of
its
routine
of
practice
and
its
check
upon
his
freedom
he
had
gone
always
with
some
sufficient
and
useful
object
to
one
far
country
after
another
lately
he
had
spent
an
unusual
number
of
consecutive
months
in
japan
which
was
still
unfamiliar
even
to
most
professional
travelers
and
he
had
come
back
to
america
enthusiastic
and
full
of
plans
for
many
enterprises
which
his
shrewd
but
not
very
persistent
brain
had
conceived
the
two
old
friends
were
delighted
to
see
each
other
but
they
took
this
meeting
as
calmly
as
if
they
were
always
neighbors
it
was
a
most
interesting
thing
that
while
they
led
such
different
lives
and
took
such
apparently
antagonistic
routes
of
progression
they
were
pretty
sure
to
arrive
at
the
same
conclusion
though
it
might
appear
otherwise
to
a
listener
who
knew
them
both
slightly
and
who
is
the
little
girl
asked
ferris
who
had
refused
his
entertainer
cigars
and
produced
a
pipe
from
one
pocket
after
having
drawn
a
handful
of
curious
small
jade
figures
from
another
and
pushed
them
along
the
edge
of
the
study
table
without
comment
for
his
friend
to
look
at
some
of
them
were
so
finely
carved
that
they
looked
like
a
heap
of
grotesque
insects
struggling
together
as
they
lay
there
but
though
leslie
eyes
brightened
as
he
glanced
at
them
he
gave
no
other
sign
of
interest
at
that
time
and
answered
his
guest
question
instead
she
is
a
ward
of
mine
he
said
she
was
left
quite
alone
by
the
death
of
her
grandmother
some
months
ago
and
so
i
brought
her
here
it
is
often
that
i
forget
a
face
said
ferris
but
i
have
been
trying
to
think
what
association
i
can
possibly
have
with
that
child
i
remember
at
last
she
looks
like
a
young
assistant
surgeon
who
was
on
the
old
frigate
fortune
with
me
just
before
i
left
the
service
i
do
think
he
was
from
this
part
of
the
country
though
i
never
heard
what
became
of
him
i
dare
say
it
was
her
father
i
believe
he
made
a
voyage
or
two
said
leslie
much
interested
do
you
know
anything
more
about
him
you
always
remember
everything
ferris
yes
answered
the
guest
slowly
puffing
away
at
his
pipe
yes
he
was
a
very
bright
fellow
with
a
great
gift
at
doctoring
but
he
was
willful
full
of
queer
twists
and
fancies
the
marry
in
haste
and
repent
at
his
leisure
sort
of
young
man
exactly
what
he
did
i
suppose
interrupted
the
host
only
his
leisure
was
fortunately
postponed
to
the
next
world
for
the
most
part
he
died
very
young
i
used
to
think
it
a
great
pity
that
he
had
not
settled
himself
ashore
in
a
good
city
practice
continued
ferris
he
had
a
great
knack
at
pleasing
people
and
making
friends
and
he
was
always
spoiling
for
want
of
work
i
was
ready
enough
to
shirk
my
part
of
that
you
may
be
sure
but
if
you
start
with
a
reasonably
healthy
set
of
men
crew
and
officers
and
keep
good
discipline
and
have
no
accidents
on
the
voyage
an
kit
of
numbered
doses
is
as
good
as
anything
on
board
a
in
time
of
peace
you
have
mild
cases
that
result
from
or
and
sometimes
a
damaged
finger
to
dress
or
a
tooth
to
pull
i
used
to
tell
young
prince
that
it
was
a
pity
one
of
the
men
would
let
himself
be
chopped
to
pieces
and
fitted
together
again
to
give
us
a
little
amusement
that
the
name
announced
nan
guardian
with
great
satisfaction
this
is
a
very
small
world
we
are
all
within
hail
of
each
other
i
dare
say
when
we
get
to
heaven
there
will
not
be
a
stranger
to
make
friends
with
i
could
give
you
more
wonderful
proofs
of
that
than
you
would
be
likely
to
believe
responded
the
surgeon
but
tell
me
how
you
happened
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
child
did
prince
wander
into
this
neighborhood
not
exactly
but
he
fell
in
love
with
a
young
girl
who
was
brought
up
on
one
of
the
farms
just
out
of
the
village
she
was
a
strange
character
a
handsome
creature
with
a
touch
of
foolish
ambition
and
soon
grew
impatient
of
the
routine
of
home
life
i
believe
that
she
went
away
at
first
to
work
in
one
of
the
factories
in
lowell
and
afterward
she
drifted
to
dunport
where
young
prince
people
lived
and
i
dare
say
it
was
when
he
came
home
from
that
very
voyage
you
knew
of
that
he
saw
her
and
married
her
she
worked
in
a
dressmaker
shop
and
worked
very
well
too
but
she
had
offended
his
sister
to
begin
with
one
day
when
she
was
finding
fault
with
some
work
that
had
been
done
for
her
and
so
there
was
no
end
of
trouble
and
the
young
man
had
a
great
battle
at
home
and
the
more
he
was
fought
the
less
inclined
he
was
to
yield
and
at
last
off
he
went
to
be
married
and
never
came
home
again
until
he
died
it
was
a
wretched
story
he
only
lived
two
years
and
they
went
from
one
place
to
another
and
finally
the
end
came
in
some
western
town
he
had
not
been
happy
with
his
wife
and
they
quarreled
from
time
to
time
and
he
asked
to
be
brought
back
to
dunport
and
buried
this
child
was
only
a
baby
and
the
princes
begged
her
mother
to
give
her
up
and
used
every
means
to
try
to
make
friends
and
to
do
what
was
right
but
i
have
always
thought
there
was
blame
on
both
sides
at
any
rate
the
wife
was
insolent
and
unruly
and
went
flinging
out
of
the
house
as
soon
as
the
funeral
was
over
i
do
know
what
became
of
them
for
a
while
but
it
always
seemed
to
me
as
if
poor
adeline
must
have
had
a
touch
of
insanity
which
faded
away
as
consumption
developed
itself
her
mother
people
were
a
fine
honest
race
and
energetic
but
there
is
a
very
bad
streak
on
the
other
side
i
have
heard
that
she
was
seen
begging
somewhere
but
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
true
at
any
rate
she
would
neither
come
here
to
her
own
home
nor
listen
to
any
plea
from
her
husband
family
and
at
last
came
back
to
the
farm
one
night
like
a
ghost
carrying
the
child
in
her
arms
across
the
fields
all
in
rags
and
tatters
both
of
them
she
confessed
to
me
that
she
had
meant
to
drown
herself
and
little
nan
together
i
could
never
understand
why
she
went
down
so
fast
i
know
that
she
had
been
drinking
some
people
might
say
that
it
was
the
scorn
of
her
husband
relatives
but
that
is
all
nonsense
and
i
have
no
doubt
she
and
the
young
man
might
have
done
very
well
if
this
had
spoiled
all
their
chances
at
the
outset
she
was
quite
unbalanced
and
a
strange
wild
creature
very
handsome
in
her
girlhood
but
morally
undeveloped
it
was
impossible
not
to
have
a
liking
for
her
i
remember
her
when
she
was
a
baby
and
yet
people
talk
about
the
prosaic
new
england
life
exclaimed
ferris
i
wonder
where
i
could
match
such
a
story
as
that
though
i
dare
say
that
you
know
a
dozen
others
i
tell
you
leslie
that
for
intense
smouldering
volcanoes
of
humanity
new
england
can
not
be
matched
the
world
over
it
like
the
regions
in
iceland
that
are
full
of
geysers
i
do
know
whether
it
is
the
inheritance
from
those
people
who
broke
away
from
the
old
countries
and
who
ought
to
be
matched
to
tremendous
circumstances
of
life
but
now
and
then
there
comes
an
amazingly
explosive
and
uncontrollable
temperament
that
goes
all
to
pieces
from
its
own
conservation
and
accumulation
of
force
by
and
by
you
will
have
all
blown
up
you
quiet
descendants
of
the
pilgrims
and
puritans
and
have
let
off
your
superfluous
wickedness
like
blizzards
and
when
the
blizzards
of
each
family
have
spent
themselves
you
will
grow
dull
and
sober
and
all
on
a
level
and
be
free
from
the
troubles
of
a
transition
state
now
you
neither
a
new
country
nor
an
old
one
you
ought
to
see
something
of
the
older
civilizations
to
understand
what
peace
of
mind
is
unless
some
importation
of
explosive
material
from
the
westward
stirs
them
up
one
century
is
made
the
pattern
for
the
next
but
it
is
perfectly
wonderful
what
this
climate
does
for
people
who
come
to
it
a
south
of
ireland
fellow
for
instance
who
has
let
himself
be
rained
on
and
then
waited
for
the
sun
to
dry
him
again
and
has
grubbed
a
little
in
a
bit
of
ground
just
enough
to
hint
to
it
that
it
had
better
be
making
a
crop
of
potatoes
for
him
i
always
expect
to
see
the
gorse
and
daisies
growing
on
the
old
people
heads
to
match
the
cabins
but
they
come
over
here
and
forget
their
idleness
and
in
a
week
or
two
the
east
winds
are
making
them
work
and
thrashing
them
if
they
are
slow
worse
than
any
who
ever
cracked
his
i
wonder
how
you
stand
it
i
do
indeed
i
ca
take
an
afternoon
nap
or
have
my
coffee
in
bed
of
a
morning
without
thinking
i
must
put
into
port
at
the
next
church
to
be
preached
at
leslie
laughed
a
little
and
shook
his
head
gently
it
very
well
for
you
to
talk
ferris
he
said
since
you
have
done
more
work
than
any
man
i
know
and
i
find
this
neighborhood
entirely
placid
one
bit
of
news
will
last
us
a
fortnight
i
dare
say
marilla
will
let
everybody
know
that
you
have
come
to
town
and
have
explained
why
she
was
ten
minutes
late
even
to
the
minister
how
about
the
little
girl
herself
asked
the
guest
presently
she
seems
well
combined
and
likely
as
they
used
to
say
when
i
was
a
boy
leslie
resumed
the
subject
willingly
so
far
as
i
can
see
she
has
the
good
qualities
of
all
her
ancestors
without
the
bad
ones
her
mother
mother
was
an
old
fashioned
country
woman
of
the
best
stock
of
course
she
resented
what
she
believed
to
be
her
daughter
wrongs
and
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
her
family
and
kept
the
child
as
carefully
as
possible
from
any
knowledge
of
them
little
nan
was
not
strong
at
first
but
i
insisted
that
she
should
be
allowed
to
run
free
out
of
doors
it
seems
to
me
that
up
to
seven
or
eight
years
of
age
children
are
simply
bundles
of
inheritances
and
i
can
see
the
traits
of
one
ancestor
after
another
but
a
little
later
than
the
usual
time
she
began
to
assert
her
own
individuality
and
has
grown
capitally
well
in
mind
and
body
ever
since
there
is
an
amusing
trace
of
the
provincial
and
and
dignity
added
to
a
quick
instinct
and
tact
and
ready
courtesy
which
must
have
come
from
the
other
side
of
her
ancestry
she
is
more
a
child
of
the
soil
than
any
country
child
i
know
and
yet
she
would
not
put
a
city
household
to
shame
she
has
seen
nothing
of
the
world
of
course
but
you
can
see
she
is
like
the
usual
village
there
is
one
thing
quite
remarkable
i
believe
she
has
grown
up
as
naturally
as
a
plant
grows
not
having
been
clipped
back
or
forced
in
any
unnatural
direction
if
ever
a
human
being
were
untrammeled
and
left
alone
to
see
what
will
come
of
it
it
is
this
child
and
i
will
own
i
am
very
much
interested
to
see
what
will
appear
later
the
navy
surgeon
eyes
twinkled
at
this
enthusiasm
but
he
asked
soberly
what
seemed
to
be
our
heroine
bent
so
far
as
could
be
discovered
and
laughed
outright
when
he
was
gravely
told
that
it
was
a
medical
bent
a
surprising
understanding
of
things
pertaining
to
that
most
delightful
profession
but
you
surely
do
mean
to
let
her
risk
her
happiness
in
following
that
career
ferris
inquired
with
feigned
anxiety
for
his
answer
you
surely
are
going
to
sacrifice
that
innocent
creature
to
a
theory
i
know
it
a
theory
last
time
i
was
here
you
could
think
of
nothing
but
hypnotism
or
else
the
action
of
belladonna
in
congestion
and
inflammation
of
the
brain
and
he
left
his
very
comfortable
chair
suddenly
with
a
burst
of
laughter
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
she
has
no
relatives
to
protect
her
and
i
consider
it
a
shocking
case
of
a
guardian
inhumanity
grown
up
naturally
indeed
i
do
doubt
that
you
supplied
her
with
bell
for
a
and
made
her
say
over
the
names
of
the
eight
little
bones
of
her
wrist
instead
of
little
pig
went
to
market
i
only
hope
that
you
live
to
grow
up
yourself
ferris
said
his
entertainer
you
certainly
be
an
ornament
to
your
generation
what
a
boy
you
are
i
should
think
you
would
feel
as
old
as
methuselah
by
this
time
after
having
rattled
from
one
place
to
the
next
all
these
years
do
you
begin
to
get
tired
no
i
do
believe
i
do
replied
ferris
lending
himself
to
this
new
turn
of
the
conversation
but
not
half
satisfied
with
the
number
of
his
jokes
i
used
to
be
afraid
i
should
and
so
i
tried
to
see
everything
i
could
of
the
world
before
my
enthusiasm
began
to
cool
and
as
for
rattling
to
the
next
place
as
you
say
you
show
yourself
to
be
no
traveler
by
nature
or
you
would
speak
so
slightingly
it
is
extremely
dangerous
to
make
long
halts
i
could
cry
with
homesickness
at
the
thought
of
the
towns
i
have
spent
more
than
a
month
in
they
are
like
the
people
one
knows
if
you
see
them
once
you
go
away
satisfied
and
you
can
bring
them
to
mind
afterward
and
think
how
they
looked
or
just
where
it
was
you
met
them
out
of
doors
or
at
the
club
but
if
you
live
with
those
people
and
get
fond
of
them
and
have
a
thousand
things
to
remember
you
get
more
pain
than
pleasure
out
of
it
when
you
go
away
and
one
ca
be
everywhere
at
once
so
if
you
going
to
care
for
things
tremendously
you
had
better
stay
in
one
town
altogether
no
give
me
a
week
or
two
and
then
i
something
calling
me
to
the
next
place
somebody
to
talk
with
or
a
book
to
see
and
off
i
go
yet
i
done
a
good
bit
of
work
in
my
day
after
all
did
you
see
that
paper
of
mine
in
the
about
some
experiments
i
made
when
i
was
last
in
india
with
those
jugglers
and
i
worked
out
some
curious
things
about
the
mathematics
of
music
on
this
last
voyage
home
why
i
thought
it
would
tear
my
heart
in
two
when
i
came
away
i
should
have
grown
to
look
like
the
people
and
you
might
have
happened
to
find
a
likeness
of
me
on
a
tea
plate
after
another
year
or
two
i
made
all
my
plans
one
day
to
stay
another
winter
and
next
day
at
eleven
i
was
steaming
down
the
harbor
but
there
was
a
poor
young
lad
i
had
taken
a
liking
for
an
english
boy
who
was
badly
off
after
an
accident
and
needed
somebody
to
look
after
him
i
thought
the
best
thing
i
could
do
was
to
bring
him
home
are
you
going
to
fit
your
ward
for
general
practice
or
for
a
specialty
i
do
know
that
be
for
the
young
person
herself
to
decide
said
leslie
but
she
showing
a
real
talent
for
medical
matters
it
is
quite
unconscious
for
the
most
part
but
i
find
that
she
understands
a
good
deal
already
and
she
sat
here
all
the
afternoon
last
week
with
one
of
my
old
medical
dictionaries
i
could
help
looking
over
her
shoulder
as
i
went
by
and
she
was
reading
about
fevers
if
you
please
as
if
it
were
a
i
did
think
it
was
worth
while
to
tell
her
we
understood
things
better
nowadays
and
did
think
it
best
to
bleed
as
much
as
old
dr
rush
recommended
you
like
a
hen
with
one
chicken
leslie
said
the
friend
still
pacing
to
and
fro
but
seriously
i
like
your
notion
of
her
having
come
to
this
of
her
own
accord
most
of
us
are
grown
in
the
shapes
that
society
and
family
preference
and
prejudice
fasten
us
into
and
do
find
out
until
we
are
well
toward
middle
life
that
we
should
have
done
a
great
deal
better
at
something
else
our
vocations
are
likely
enough
to
be
illy
chosen
since
few
persons
are
fit
to
choose
them
for
us
and
we
are
at
the
most
unreasonable
stage
of
life
when
we
choose
them
for
ourselves
and
what
the
lord
made
some
people
for
nobody
ever
can
understand
some
of
us
are
for
use
and
more
are
for
waste
like
the
flowers
i
am
in
such
a
hurry
to
know
what
the
next
world
is
like
that
i
can
hardly
wait
to
get
to
it
good
heavens
we
live
here
in
our
familiar
fashion
going
at
a
pace
round
our
little
circles
with
only
a
friend
or
two
to
speak
with
who
understand
us
and
a
pipe
and
a
and
a
few
books
and
some
old
clothes
and
please
ourselves
by
thinking
we
know
the
universe
not
a
soul
of
us
can
tell
what
it
is
that
sends
word
to
our
little
fingers
to
move
themselves
back
and
forward
we
sure
of
two
things
at
any
rate
said
leslie
love
to
god
and
love
to
man
and
though
i
have
lived
here
all
my
days
i
have
learned
some
truths
just
as
well
as
if
i
had
gone
about
with
you
or
even
been
to
the
next
world
and
come
back
i
have
seen
too
many
lives
go
to
pieces
and
too
many
dissatisfied
faces
and
i
have
heard
too
many
sorrowful
confessions
from
these
country
i
have
watched
beside
one
after
another
for
twenty
or
thirty
years
and
if
i
can
help
one
good
child
to
work
with
nature
and
not
against
it
and
to
follow
the
lines
marked
out
for
her
and
she
turns
out
useful
and
intelligent
and
keeps
off
the
rocks
of
mistaking
her
duty
i
shall
be
more
than
glad
i
do
care
whether
it
a
man
work
or
a
work
if
it
is
hers
i
going
to
help
her
the
very
best
way
i
can
i
do
talk
to
her
of
course
she
much
too
young
but
i
watch
her
and
mean
to
put
the
things
in
her
way
that
she
seems
to
reach
out
for
and
try
to
find
she
is
going
to
be
very
practical
for
her
hands
can
almost
always
work
out
her
ideas
already
i
like
to
see
her
take
hold
of
things
and
i
like
to
see
her
walk
and
the
way
she
lifts
her
feet
and
puts
them
down
again
i
must
say
ferris
there
is
a
great
satisfaction
in
finding
a
human
being
once
in
a
while
that
has
some
use
of
itself
you
right
said
ferris
but
do
be
disappointed
when
ten
years
older
if
she
picks
out
a
handsome
young
man
and
thinks
there
is
nothing
like
housekeeping
have
you
taken
a
look
at
my
pocketful
of
heathen
idols
there
yet
i
do
think
you
ever
seen
their
mates
the
stayer
at
home
smiled
as
if
he
understood
his
friend
quiet
bit
of
pleasantry
and
reached
for
one
of
the
treasures
but
folded
it
in
his
hand
without
looking
at
it
and
seemed
to
be
lost
in
meditation
the
surgeon
concluded
that
he
had
had
enough
exercise
and
laid
himself
down
on
the
wide
sofa
at
the
end
of
the
room
from
whence
he
could
watch
his
companion
face
he
clasped
his
hands
under
his
head
and
looked
eager
and
interested
he
had
grown
to
have
something
of
the
appearance
of
a
foreigner
as
people
often
do
who
have
spent
much
time
in
eastern
countries
the
two
friends
were
silent
for
some
minutes
until
an
impatient
voice
roused
leslie
from
his
reflections
it
always
makes
me
covet
my
neighbor
wits
when
i
see
you
announced
the
wanderer
if
i
settled
myself
into
a
respectable
practice
i
should
be
obliged
to
march
with
the
army
of
doctors
who
carry
a
great
array
of
small
weapons
and
who
find
out
what
is
the
matter
with
their
patients
after
all
sorts
of
experiment
and
painstaking
analysis
and
comparing
the
results
of
their
thermometers
and
microscopes
with
scientific
books
of
reference
after
i
have
done
all
that
you
know
if
i
have
had
good
luck
i
shall
come
to
exactly
what
you
can
say
before
you
have
been
with
a
sick
man
five
minutes
you
have
the
true
gift
for
doctoring
you
need
no
medical
dictator
and
whatever
you
study
and
whatever
comes
to
you
in
the
way
of
instruction
simply
ministers
to
your
intuition
it
grows
to
be
a
wonderful
in
such
a
man
as
you
i
do
believe
you
investigate
a
case
and
treat
it
as
a
botanist
does
a
strange
flower
once
a
month
you
know
without
telling
yourself
what
the
matter
is
and
what
the
special
difference
is
and
the
relative
dangers
of
this
case
and
one
apparently
just
like
it
across
the
street
and
you
could
do
this
before
you
were
out
of
the
hospitals
i
remember
you
and
after
a
few
vigorous
puffs
of
smoke
he
went
on
it
is
all
very
well
for
the
rest
of
the
men
to
be
proud
of
their
book
learning
but
they
do
even
try
to
follow
nature
as
sydenham
did
who
followed
no
man
i
believe
such
study
takes
one
to
more
theory
and
scientific
digest
rather
than
to
more
skill
it
is
all
very
well
to
know
how
to
draw
maps
when
one
gets
lost
on
a
dark
night
or
even
to
begin
with
astronomical
calculations
and
come
down
to
a
chemical
analysis
of
the
mud
you
stand
in
but
hang
me
if
i
would
rather
have
the
instinct
of
a
dog
who
can
go
straight
home
across
a
bit
of
strange
country
a
man
has
no
right
to
be
a
doctor
if
he
does
simply
make
everything
bend
to
his
work
of
getting
sick
people
well
and
of
trying
to
remedy
the
failures
of
strength
that
come
from
misuse
or
inheritance
or
ignorance
the
anatomists
and
the
pathologists
have
their
place
but
we
must
look
to
the
living
to
learn
the
laws
of
life
not
to
the
dead
a
wreck
shows
you
where
the
reef
is
perhaps
but
not
how
to
manage
a
ship
in
the
offing
the
men
who
make
it
their
business
to
write
the
books
and
the
men
who
make
it
their
business
to
follow
them
are
the
ones
for
successful
practice
leslie
smiled
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
his
beloved
library
shelves
as
if
he
wished
to
assure
the
useful
volumes
of
his
continued
affection
and
respect
and
said
quietly
as
if
to
beg
the
displeased
surgeon
patience
with
his
brethren
they
go
on
poor
fellows
studying
the
symptoms
and
never
taking
it
in
that
the
life
power
is
at
fault
i
see
more
and
more
plainly
that
we
ought
to
strengthen
and
balance
the
whole
system
and
aid
nature
to
make
the
sick
man
well
again
it
is
nature
that
does
it
after
all
and
diseases
are
oftener
effects
of
illness
than
causes
but
the
young
practitioners
must
follow
the
a
while
until
they
have
had
enough
experience
to
open
their
eyes
to
observe
and
have
learned
to
think
for
themselves
i
do
know
which
is
worse
too
much
routine
or
no
study
at
all
i
was
trying
the
other
day
to
count
up
the
different
treatments
of
pneumonia
that
have
been
in
fashion
in
our
day
there
must
be
seven
or
eight
and
i
am
only
afraid
the
next
thing
will
be
a
sort
of
skepticism
and
contempt
of
remedies
johnson
said
long
ago
that
physicians
were
a
class
of
men
who
put
bodies
of
which
they
knew
little
into
bodies
of
which
they
knew
less
but
certainly
this
is
the
fault
of
the
medicines
altogether
you
and
i
know
well
enough
they
are
often
most
stupidly
used
if
we
blindly
follow
the
medical
dictators
as
you
call
them
and
spend
our
treatment
on
the
effects
instead
of
the
causes
what
success
can
we
expect
we
do
want
more
suggestions
from
the
men
at
work
but
i
suppose
this
is
the
same
with
every
business
the
practical
medical
men
are
the
juries
who
settle
all
the
theories
of
the
hour
as
they
meet
emergencies
day
after
day
the
men
who
have
the
true
gift
for
their
work
said
ferris
impatiently
i
had
the
conscience
to
go
on
myself
that
why
i
resigned
you
know
i
can
talk
about
it
but
i
am
not
a
good
workman
but
if
there
are
going
to
be
doctors
in
the
next
world
i
wish
i
might
be
lucky
enough
to
be
equal
to
such
a
heavenly
business
you
thought
i
did
care
enough
about
the
profession
to
go
on
but
it
was
so
do
push
your
little
girl
ahead
if
she
has
the
real
fitness
i
suppose
it
is
a
part
of
your
endowment
that
you
can
distinguish
the
capacities
and
tendencies
of
health
as
well
as
illness
and
there
one
thing
certain
the
world
can
not
afford
to
do
without
the
workmen
who
are
masters
of
their
business
by
divine
right
leslie
was
looking
at
the
gods
i
suppose
the
poor
fellows
who
chipped
out
these
treasures
of
yours
may
have
thought
they
were
really
putting
a
visible
piece
of
heaven
within
their
reach
he
said
we
ca
get
used
to
the
fact
that
whatever
truly
belongs
to
the
next
world
is
not
visible
in
this
and
that
there
is
and
worshiping
forever
going
on
when
we
let
ourselves
forget
to
educate
our
faith
and
our
spiritual
intellects
and
lose
sight
of
our
relation
and
dependence
upon
the
highest
informing
strength
we
are
trying
to
move
our
machinery
by
some
inferior
motive
power
we
worship
our
tools
and
beg
success
of
them
instead
of
remembering
that
we
are
all
apprentices
to
the
great
master
of
our
own
and
every
man
craft
it
is
the
great
ideas
of
our
work
that
we
need
and
the
laws
of
its
truths
we
shall
be
more
intelligent
by
and
by
about
making
the
best
of
ourselves
our
possibilities
are
infinitely
beyond
what
most
people
even
dream
spiritual
laziness
and
physical
laziness
together
keep
us
just
this
side
of
sound
sleep
most
of
the
time
perhaps
you
think
it
is
a
proper
season
for
one
at
least
dear
me
no
said
ferris
who
was
evidently
quite
wide
awake
do
you
remember
how
well
buckle
says
that
the
feminine
intellect
is
the
higher
and
that
the
great
geniuses
of
the
world
have
possessed
it
the
gift
of
intuition
reaches
directly
towards
the
truth
and
it
is
only
reasoning
by
deduction
that
can
take
flight
into
the
upper
air
of
life
and
certainty
you
remember
what
he
says
about
that
yes
said
leslie
yes
it
is
a
thing
one
easily
forgets
but
i
have
long
believed
that
the
powers
of
christ
were
but
the
higher
powers
of
our
common
humanity
we
recognize
them
dimly
now
and
then
but
few
of
us
dare
to
say
so
yet
the
world
moves
very
slowly
it
if
christ
were
perfect
man
he
could
hardly
tell
us
to
follow
him
and
be
like
him
and
yet
know
all
the
while
that
it
was
quite
impossible
because
a
difference
in
his
gifts
made
his
character
an
unapproachable
one
to
ours
we
do
amount
to
anything
simply
because
we
wo
understand
that
we
must
receive
the
strength
of
heaven
into
our
souls
that
it
depends
upon
our
degree
of
receptivity
and
our
using
the
added
power
that
comes
in
that
way
not
in
our
taking
our
few
tools
and
our
and
satisfaction
with
ourselves
and
doing
our
little
tricks
like
dancing
dogs
proud
because
the
other
dogs
can
do
one
less
than
we
or
only
bark
and
walk
about
on
their
four
legs
it
is
our
souls
that
make
our
bodies
worth
anything
and
the
life
of
the
soul
does
come
from
its
activity
or
any
performance
of
its
own
those
things
are
only
the
results
and
the
signs
of
life
not
the
causes
of
it
christ
in
us
the
hope
of
glory
said
the
other
doctor
gravely
and
christ
glory
was
his
usefulness
and
gift
for
helping
others
i
believe
there
less
quackery
in
our
profession
than
any
other
but
it
is
amazing
how
we
bungle
at
it
i
wonder
how
you
will
get
on
with
your
little
girl
if
people
did
have
theories
of
life
of
their
own
or
would
go
exactly
the
wrong
way
it
would
be
easier
to
offer
assistance
but
where
one
person
takes
a
right
direction
of
his
own
accord
there
are
twenty
who
wander
to
and
fro
i
may
as
well
confess
to
you
he
continued
presently
that
i
have
had
a
myself
but
i
do
look
for
much
future
joy
in
watching
the
development
of
my
plots
he
has
taken
affairs
into
his
own
hands
and
i
dare
say
it
is
much
better
for
him
for
if
i
had
caught
him
young
enough
i
should
have
wished
him
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
all
the
professions
not
to
speak
of
the
arts
and
sciences
he
was
a
clever
young
fellow
i
saw
him
married
the
day
before
i
left
england
his
wife
was
the
daughter
of
a
curate
and
he
the
younger
son
of
a
younger
son
and
it
was
a
love
affair
worth
two
or
three
it
came
to
be
a
question
of
money
alone
i
had
known
the
boy
the
year
before
in
bombay
and
chanced
to
find
him
one
day
in
the
marine
hospital
at
nagasaki
we
had
been
up
into
the
interior
together
he
was
recommended
to
me
as
a
sort
of
secretary
and
assistant
and
knew
more
than
i
did
about
most
things
when
he
caught
sight
of
me
he
cried
like
a
baby
and
i
sat
down
and
heard
what
the
trouble
was
for
i
had
let
him
go
off
with
somebody
who
could
give
him
a
good
salary
a
government
man
of
position
and
i
thought
poor
bob
would
be
put
in
the
way
of
something
better
dear
me
the
climate
was
killing
him
before
my
eyes
and
i
took
passage
for
both
of
us
on
the
next
day
steamer
when
i
got
him
home
i
turned
my
bank
account
into
a
cheque
and
tucked
it
into
his
pocket
and
told
him
to
marry
his
wife
and
settle
down
and
be
respectable
and
forget
such
a
wandering
old
fellow
as
i
the
listener
made
a
little
sound
of
mingled
admiration
and
disgust
so
you
the
same
piece
of
improvidence
as
ever
i
wonder
if
you
worked
your
passage
over
to
boston
or
came
as
a
stowaway
well
glad
to
give
you
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
wondering
how
i
should
get
on
without
somebody
to
help
me
in
a
piece
of
surgery
my
neighbors
are
not
very
skillful
but
they
good
men
every
one
of
them
unless
it
old
jackson
who
knows
no
more
about
the
practice
of
medicine
than
a
turtle
knows
about
the
nearest
fixed
star
ferris
i
do
wonder
at
your
giving
away
the
last
cent
you
had
in
the
world
i
only
wonder
that
you
had
a
cent
to
give
i
hope
the
young
man
was
grateful
that
all
only
i
not
sure
i
like
his
taking
it
he
thought
i
had
enough
more
i
dare
say
he
said
so
much
i
stand
his
nonsense
he
use
it
better
than
i
could
said
the
guest
briefly
as
i
said
i
could
bring
him
up
in
the
first
place
i
have
the
patience
and
beside
it
would
be
just
to
him
but
you
must
let
me
know
how
you
get
on
with
your
project
i
shall
make
you
a
day
visit
once
in
six
months
that
be
good
luck
responded
the
cheerful
host
now
that
i
am
growing
old
i
find
i
wish
for
company
oftener
just
the
right
man
you
know
to
come
in
for
an
hour
or
two
late
in
the
evening
to
have
a
cigar
and
not
say
a
word
if
he
does
feel
like
it
the
two
friends
were
very
comfortable
together
the
successive
cigars
burnt
themselves
out
slowly
and
the
light
of
the
great
lamp
was
bright
in
the
room
here
and
there
a
tinge
of
red
shone
out
on
the
backs
of
the
books
that
stood
close
together
in
the
high
cases
there
was
an
old
engraving
or
two
and
in
one
corner
a
solemn
bronze
figure
of
dante
thin
and
angular
as
if
he
had
risen
from
his
coffin
to
take
a
last
look
at
this
world
marilla
had
often
spoken
of
him
disrespectfully
and
had
suggested
many
other
ornaments
which
might
be
brought
to
take
his
place
but
the
doctor
had
never
acted
upon
her
suggestions
from
the
corner
of
one
there
hung
a
huge
nest
and
over
the
which
was
only
wide
enough
for
some
cigar
boxes
and
a
little
clock
and
a
few
vials
of
medicines
was
a
rack
where
three
or
four
riding
whips
and
a
curious
silver
bit
and
some
pipes
found
unmolested
quarters
and
in
one
corner
were
some
walking
sticks
and
a
fishing
rod
or
two
which
had
a
very
ancient
unused
look
there
was
a
portrait
of
leslie
grandfather
opposite
the
a
looking
old
gentleman
who
had
been
the
most
famous
of
the
oldfields
ministers
the
was
wide
and
long
but
it
was
well
covered
with
a
miscellaneous
array
of
its
owner
smaller
possessions
and
the
visitor
smiled
as
he
caught
sight
of
nan
new
copy
of
miss
edgeworth
assistant
lying
open
and
face
downward
on
the
top
of
an
instrument
case
marilla
did
not
hear
the
doctor
and
his
guest
tramp
up
to
bed
until
very
late
at
night
and
though
she
had
tried
to
keep
awake
she
had
been
obliged
to
take
a
nap
first
and
then
wake
up
again
to
get
the
benefit
of
such
an
aggravating
occasion
i
not
going
to
fret
myself
trying
to
make
one
of
my
baked
omelets
in
the
morning
she
assured
herself
they
keep
breakfast
waiting
three
quarters
of
an
hour
and
it
would
fall
flat
sure
the
world
and
the
doctor
got
to
ride
to
all
of
the
compass
too
x
across
the
street
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
why
the
village
of
oldfields
should
have
been
placed
in
the
least
attractive
part
of
the
township
if
one
were
not
somewhat
familiar
with
the
law
of
growth
of
country
communities
the
first
settlers
being
pious
kindred
of
the
pilgrims
were
mindful
of
the
necessity
of
a
and
the
place
for
it
was
chosen
with
reference
to
the
convenience
of
most
of
the
worshipers
then
the
parson
was
given
a
parsonage
and
a
tract
of
glebe
land
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
of
his
pulpit
and
since
this
was
the
centre
of
social
attraction
the
blacksmith
built
his
shop
at
the
nearest
and
when
some
enterprising
citizen
became
possessed
of
an
idea
that
there
were
traders
enough
toiling
to
and
fro
on
the
rough
highways
to
the
nearest
larger
village
to
make
it
worth
his
while
to
be
an
interceptor
the
first
step
was
taken
toward
a
local
centre
of
commerce
and
the
village
was
fairly
begun
it
had
not
yet
reached
a
remarkable
size
though
there
was
a
joke
because
an
enthusiastic
old
woman
had
said
once
when
four
or
five
houses
and
a
new
were
being
built
all
in
one
summer
that
she
expected
now
that
she
might
live
to
see
oldfields
a
seaport
town
there
had
been
a
great
excitement
over
the
second
to
which
the
conservative
faction
had
strongly
objected
but
after
the
radicals
had
once
gained
the
day
other
innovations
passed
without
public
challenge
the
old
first
parish
church
was
very
white
and
held
aloft
an
imposing
steeple
and
strangers
were
always
commiserated
if
they
had
to
leave
town
without
the
opportunity
of
seeing
its
front
by
moonlight
behind
this
and
beyond
a
green
which
had
been
the
playground
of
many
generations
of
boys
and
girls
was
a
long
row
of
where
the
farmers
horses
enjoyed
such
part
of
their
sunday
rest
as
was
permitted
them
after
bringing
heavy
loads
of
rural
parishioners
to
their
public
devotions
the
sunday
was
by
no
means
so
carefully
observed
in
these
days
as
in
former
ones
when
disinclination
was
anything
but
a
received
excuse
in
parson
leslie
the
doctor
grandfather
day
it
would
have
condemned
a
man
or
woman
to
the
reproof
of
their
acquaintances
and
indeed
most
parishioners
felt
deprived
of
a
great
pleasure
when
after
a
week
of
separation
from
society
of
a
routine
of
prosaic
they
were
prevented
from
seeing
their
friends
parade
into
church
from
hearing
the
and
the
sermon
and
listening
to
the
news
afterward
it
was
like
going
to
mass
and
going
to
the
theatre
and
the
opera
and
making
a
round
of
short
calls
and
having
an
outing
in
one
own
best
clothes
to
see
other
people
all
rolled
into
one
beside
which
there
was
and
is
a
superstitious
expectation
of
good
luck
in
the
coming
week
if
the
religious
obligations
were
carefully
fulfilled
so
many
of
the
old
ideas
of
the
efficacy
of
ecclesiasticism
still
linger
most
of
them
by
no
means
unlawfully
the
elder
people
of
new
england
are
as
glad
to
have
their
clergyman
visit
them
in
their
last
days
as
if
he
granted
them
absolution
and
extreme
unction
the
old
traditions
survive
in
our
instincts
although
our
present
opinions
have
long
since
ticketed
many
thoughts
and
desires
and
customs
as
out
of
date
and
quite
exploded
we
go
so
far
in
our
vigorous
observance
of
the
first
commandment
and
our
fear
of
worshiping
strange
gods
that
sometimes
we
are
in
danger
of
forgetting
that
we
must
worship
god
himself
and
worship
is
something
different
from
a
certain
sort
of
constant
or
from
even
trying
to
be
conformers
and
to
keep
our
own
laws
and
our
neighbors
because
an
town
like
oldfields
grows
so
slowly
and
with
such
extreme
deliberation
is
the
very
reason
it
seems
to
have
such
a
delightful
completeness
when
it
has
entered
fairly
upon
its
maturity
it
is
possessed
of
kindred
virtues
to
a
winter
pear
which
may
be
unattractive
during
its
preparatory
stages
but
which
takes
time
to
gather
from
the
ground
and
from
the
air
a
pleasant
and
rewarding
individuality
and
sweetness
the
towns
which
are
built
in
a
hurry
can
be
left
in
a
hurry
without
a
bit
of
regret
and
if
it
is
the
fate
or
fortune
of
the
elder
villages
to
find
themselves
the
foundation
upon
which
modern
manufacturing
communities
rear
their
thinly
built
houses
and
workshops
and
their
quickly
disintegrating
communities
of
people
the
weaknesses
of
these
are
more
glaring
and
hopeless
in
the
contrast
the
hurry
to
make
money
and
do
much
work
and
the
ambition
to
do
good
work
war
with
each
other
but
as
longfellow
has
said
the
lie
is
the
hurrying
of
the
clock
and
the
truth
the
slower
hand
that
waits
and
marks
the
hour
the
new
england
that
built
itself
houses
a
hundred
years
ago
was
far
less
oppressed
by
competition
and
by
other
questions
with
which
the
enormous
increase
of
population
is
worrying
its
younger
citizens
and
the
overgrown
oldfields
that
increase
now
street
by
street
were
built
then
a
single
steady
house
at
a
time
and
all
the
neighbors
watched
them
rise
and
knew
where
the
planks
were
sawn
and
where
the
chimney
bricks
were
burnt
in
these
days
when
anna
prince
was
young
and
had
lately
come
to
live
in
the
doctor
square
house
with
the
three
peaked
windows
in
the
roof
and
the
tall
box
borders
and
lilac
bushes
in
its
neat
front
yard
oldfields
was
just
beginning
to
wake
from
a
fifty
architectural
sleep
and
rub
its
eyes
and
see
what
was
thought
about
a
smart
little
house
with
a
sharp
gabled
roof
and
much
scalloping
of
its
edges
which
a
new
had
seen
fit
to
build
there
was
one
long
street
which
had
plenty
of
room
on
either
side
for
most
of
the
houses
and
where
it
divided
each
side
of
the
first
parish
church
it
became
the
east
road
and
the
west
road
and
the
rest
of
the
dwellings
strayed
off
somewhat
undecidedly
toward
the
world
beyond
there
were
a
good
many
poplars
in
the
front
yards
though
their
former
proud
ranks
were
broken
in
many
places
so
that
surviving
veterans
stood
on
guard
irregularly
before
the
houses
where
usually
one
or
two
members
of
the
once
busy
households
were
also
left
alone
many
of
the
people
who
lived
in
the
village
had
outlying
land
and
were
farmers
of
it
but
beside
the
doctor
there
were
some
other
households
which
the
land
supported
indirectly
either
through
professions
or
because
some
kind
ancestor
had
laid
by
enough
money
for
his
children
and
grandchildren
the
ministers
were
both
excellent
men
but
leslie
was
the
only
man
who
looked
far
ahead
or
saw
much
or
cared
much
for
true
success
in
titian
great
venetian
picture
of
the
presentation
of
the
virgin
while
the
little
maiden
goes
soberly
up
the
steps
of
the
temple
in
the
busy
crowd
beneath
only
one
man
is
possessed
by
the
thought
that
something
wonderful
is
happening
and
lifts
his
head
forgetting
the
buyers
and
sellers
and
gossipers
as
his
eyes
follow
the
sacred
sight
life
goes
on
everywhere
like
that
fragment
of
it
in
the
picture
but
while
the
man
who
knows
more
than
his
fellows
can
be
found
in
every
company
and
sees
the
light
which
beckons
him
on
to
the
higher
meanings
and
better
gifts
his
place
in
society
is
not
always
such
a
comfortable
and
honored
one
as
leslie
what
his
friends
were
apt
to
call
his
notions
were
not
of
such
aggressive
nature
that
he
was
accused
of
outlawry
and
he
was
apt
to
speak
his
mind
uncontradicted
and
undisturbed
he
cared
little
for
the
friction
and
attrition
indeed
for
the
inspiration
which
one
is
sure
to
have
who
lives
among
many
people
and
which
are
so
dear
and
so
helpful
to
most
of
us
who
fall
into
ruts
if
we
are
too
much
alone
he
loved
his
friends
and
his
books
though
he
understood
both
as
few
scholars
can
and
he
cared
little
for
social
pleasure
though
oldfields
was
like
all
places
of
its
size
and
dignity
an
epitome
of
the
world
one
or
two
people
of
each
class
and
rank
are
as
good
as
fifty
and
to
use
the
saying
of
the
doctor
friend
old
captain
finch
human
nature
is
the
same
the
world
over
through
the
long
years
of
his
solitary
life
and
his
busy
days
as
a
country
practitioner
he
had
become
less
and
less
inclined
to
take
much
part
in
what
feeble
efforts
the
rest
of
the
townspeople
made
to
entertain
themselves
he
was
more
apt
to
loiter
along
the
street
stopping
here
and
there
to
talk
with
his
neighbors
at
their
gates
or
their
gardening
and
not
infrequently
asked
some
one
who
stood
in
need
of
such
friendliness
to
take
a
drive
with
him
out
into
the
country
nobody
was
grieved
at
remembering
that
he
was
a
repository
of
many
secrets
he
was
a
friend
who
could
be
trusted
always
though
he
was
one
who
had
been
by
no
means
slow
to
anger
or
unwilling
at
times
to
administer
rebuke
one
sunday
afternoon
late
in
november
while
the
first
of
the
year
was
beginning
leslie
threw
down
a
stout
french
medical
work
of
high
renown
as
if
it
had
failed
to
fulfil
its
mission
of
being
instructive
first
and
interesting
afterward
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
stood
looking
at
the
insulted
volume
as
if
he
had
a
mind
to
apologize
and
try
again
but
kept
his
hands
behind
him
after
all
it
was
thinly
dressed
in
fluttering
paper
covers
and
was
so
thick
and
so
lightly
bound
that
it
had
a
tendency
to
divide
its
material
substance
into
parts
like
the
seventhlies
and
eighthlies
of
an
sermon
those
fellows
must
be
in
league
with
the
over
here
grumbled
the
doctor
i
must
send
word
to
that
man
in
new
york
to
have
some
sort
of
cover
put
on
these
things
before
they
come
down
then
he
lifted
the
book
again
and
poised
it
on
one
hand
looking
at
its
irregular
edges
and
reflecting
at
length
that
it
would
be
in
much
better
condition
if
he
had
not
given
it
a
careless
crushing
in
the
corner
of
his
carriage
the
day
before
it
had
been
sunshiny
pleasant
weather
and
he
had
taken
nan
for
a
long
drive
in
the
saturday
he
had
decided
before
starting
that
she
should
manage
the
reins
and
he
would
think
over
one
or
two
matters
and
read
a
while
it
had
been
a
great
convenience
lately
that
nan
understood
the
responsibility
of
a
horse
and
carriage
he
was
finding
her
a
more
and
more
useful
little
companion
however
his
studies
and
reflections
had
been
postponed
until
some
other
time
for
nan
had
been
very
eager
to
talk
about
some
of
her
lessons
in
which
it
seemed
his
duty
to
take
an
interest
the
child
seemed
stronger
and
better
that
autumn
than
he
had
ever
known
her
and
her
mind
had
suddenly
fastened
itself
upon
certain
of
her
studies
she
seemed
very
quick
and
very
accurate
the
doctor
thought
and
the
two
traits
do
not
always
associate
themselves
he
left
the
table
and
walked
quickly
to
the
west
window
and
clasping
his
hands
behind
him
stood
looking
out
into
the
front
yard
and
the
street
beyond
the
ground
was
already
white
and
he
gave
a
little
sigh
for
winter
weather
is
rarely
a
source
of
happiness
to
a
doctor
although
this
member
of
the
profession
was
not
made
altogether
sorrowful
by
it
he
sometimes
keenly
enjoyed
a
hard
tramp
of
a
mile
or
two
when
the
roads
were
so
blocked
and
the
snow
so
blinding
that
he
left
his
horse
in
some
sheltering
barn
on
his
way
to
an
impatient
sufferer
a
little
way
down
the
street
on
the
other
side
was
a
house
much
like
his
own
with
a
row
of
tall
hemlocks
beside
it
and
a
front
fence
higher
and
more
imposing
than
his
with
great
posts
at
the
gateway
which
held
slender
urns
aloft
with
funereal
solemnity
the
eyesight
was
not
far
from
perfect
and
he
looked
earnestly
at
the
windows
of
one
of
the
lower
rooms
and
saw
a
familiar
sight
enough
his
neighbor
graham
face
in
its
accustomed
quarter
of
the
sash
leslie
half
smiled
as
the
thought
struck
him
that
she
always
sat
so
exactly
in
the
same
place
that
her
white
cap
was
to
be
seen
through
the
same
lower
most
people
would
have
moved
their
chairs
about
until
they
wore
holes
in
the
floor
he
told
himself
and
then
remembered
how
many
times
he
had
gone
to
look
over
at
his
placid
friend
in
her
favorite
afternoon
post
of
observation
he
was
strongly
attached
to
her
and
he
reminded
himself
that
she
was
growing
old
and
that
he
must
try
to
see
her
oftener
he
valued
her
companionship
more
because
he
knew
it
was
always
ready
for
him
than
because
he
always
availed
himself
of
it
but
the
sense
of
mutual
dependence
made
them
very
familiar
to
each
other
when
they
did
meet
and
had
time
for
a
bit
of
quiet
talk
leslie
suddenly
turned
he
had
watched
long
enough
to
make
sure
that
graham
was
alone
her
head
had
not
moved
for
many
minutes
and
at
first
he
was
going
out
of
the
front
door
from
some
instinct
he
would
hardly
have
been
willing
to
acknowledge
but
he
resolutely
turned
and
went
out
to
the
to
tell
marilla
after
his
usual
professional
custom
of
giving
notice
of
his
whereabouts
that
he
was
going
to
graham
a
prompt
inquiry
came
from
the
kitchen
to
know
if
anything
ailed
her
to
which
the
doctor
returned
a
scornful
negative
and
escaped
through
the
which
gave
entrance
both
to
the
study
and
the
there
was
the
usual
service
at
marilla
but
she
had
not
ventured
out
to
attend
it
giving
the
weather
and
a
grumbling
toothache
for
her
reasons
though
she
concealed
the
fact
that
the
faithless
town
milliner
had
disappointed
her
about
finishing
her
winter
bonnet
marilla
had
begun
life
with
certain
opinions
which
she
had
never
changed
though
time
and
occasion
had
lessened
the
value
of
some
of
them
she
liked
to
count
herself
among
those
who
are
persecuted
for
conscience
sake
and
was
immensely
fond
of
an
argument
and
of
having
it
known
that
she
was
a
dissenter
from
the
first
parish
church
graham
looked
up
with
surprise
from
her
book
to
see
the
doctor
coming
in
from
the
street
and
being
helplessly
lame
sat
still
and
put
out
her
hand
to
greet
him
with
a
very
pleased
look
on
her
face
is
there
anything
the
matter
with
me
she
asked
i
have
begun
to
think
you
do
care
to
associate
with
well
people
you
do
usually
go
to
church
in
the
afternoon
either
so
you
have
taken
refuge
here
because
talcot
is
ill
i
must
say
that
i
missed
hearing
the
bell
i
shall
lose
myself
altogether
by
the
middle
of
the
week
one
must
have
some
landmarks
marilla
complained
yesterday
that
she
was
all
at
sea
because
her
apple
pies
gave
out
a
day
too
soon
she
put
the
bread
to
rise
the
wrong
night
and
everything
went
wrong
about
the
sweeping
it
has
been
a
week
of
great
domestic
calamity
with
us
but
nan
confided
to
me
this
morning
that
there
was
some
trouble
with
our
bonnet
into
the
bargain
i
had
forgotten
it
was
time
for
that
said
the
doctor
laughing
we
always
have
a
season
of
great
anxiety
and
disaster
until
the
bonnet
question
is
settled
i
keep
out
of
the
way
as
much
as
i
can
once
i
tried
to
be
amusing
and
said
it
was
a
pity
the
women
did
not
follow
their
grandmothers
fashion
and
make
a
good
leghorn
structure
last
ten
years
and
have
no
more
trouble
about
it
but
i
was
assured
that
there
was
a
milliner
now
living
who
could
set
such
an
arrangement
going
marilla
taste
is
not
what
one
might
call
commonplace
said
graham
with
a
smile
i
think
her
summer
was
a
little
the
most
remarkable
we
have
had
yet
she
dresses
so
decently
otherwise
good
soul
it
was
astonishing
said
the
doctor
gravely
as
he
stood
before
the
fire
thinking
how
pleasant
the
room
looked
almost
as
familiar
as
his
own
study
with
its
heavy
mahogany
furniture
and
two
old
portraits
and
few
quaint
ornaments
graham
geraniums
were
all
flourishing
and
green
and
even
in
bloom
unlike
most
treasures
of
their
kind
there
was
a
modern
element
in
the
room
also
some
pretty
cushions
and
other
bits
of
embroidery
for
graham
had
some
grandchildren
who
were
city
born
and
bred
and
who
made
little
offerings
to
her
from
time
to
time
on
the
table
near
her
and
between
the
front
windows
were
many
new
books
and
magazines
and
though
the
two
neighbors
kept
up
a
regular
system
of
exchange
the
doctor
went
nearer
to
see
what
might
be
found
there
were
a
few
minutes
of
silence
and
he
became
conscious
that
graham
was
making
up
her
mind
to
say
something
but
when
she
spoke
it
was
only
to
ask
if
there
were
anything
serious
the
matter
with
the
minister
oh
no
said
the
doctor
he
a
dyspeptic
nervous
soul
too
conscientious
and
when
the
time
arrives
for
the
sacrifice
of
pigs
and
his
whole
admiring
parish
vie
with
each
other
to
offer
on
that
shrine
it
goes
hard
with
the
poor
man
this
was
worth
hearing
but
graham
was
a
little
sorry
that
she
had
let
such
a
good
chance
go
by
for
saying
something
that
was
near
her
heart
so
presently
she
added
i
am
sorry
that
poor
marilla
has
a
better
gift
at
personal
decoration
it
seems
a
pity
to
let
her
disfigure
that
pretty
child
with
such
structures
in
the
way
of
i
was
so
glad
when
that
abominable
great
summer
hat
was
laid
by
for
the
season
it
was
pretty
bad
the
doctor
agreed
in
a
provokingly
indifferent
tone
whereupon
graham
interest
was
rekindled
and
saying
to
herself
that
the
poor
man
did
not
know
the
danger
and
foolishness
of
such
carelessness
she
ventured
another
comment
so
much
depends
upon
giving
a
child
taste
the
right
direction
leslie
had
taken
up
a
magazine
and
seemed
to
have
found
something
that
pleased
him
but
he
at
once
laid
it
down
and
glanced
once
or
twice
at
his
hostess
as
if
he
hoped
for
future
instructions
you
see
i
do
know
anything
about
it
and
nan
does
think
of
her
clothes
at
all
so
far
as
i
can
tell
and
so
poor
marilla
has
to
do
the
best
she
can
he
said
mildly
oh
dear
yes
answered
graham
not
without
impatience
but
the
child
appearance
is
of
some
importance
and
since
a
dollar
or
two
does
make
any
difference
to
you
she
should
be
made
to
look
like
the
little
lady
that
she
is
dear
old
thacher
would
turn
in
her
grave
for
she
certainly
had
a
simple
good
taste
that
was
better
than
this
marilla
became
the
easy
prey
of
that
foolish
little
woman
who
makes
bonnets
on
the
east
road
she
has
done
more
to
deprave
the
ideas
of
our
townspeople
than
one
would
believe
and
they
tell
you
with
such
pleasure
that
she
used
to
work
in
new
york
as
if
that
settled
the
question
it
is
a
comfort
to
see
old
sally
turner
and
miss
betsy
milman
go
by
in
their
decent
dark
silk
bonnets
that
good
susan
martin
made
for
them
if
i
could
go
out
i
believe
i
would
rather
hunt
for
a
very
large
velvet
specimen
of
her
work
which
is
somewhere
upstairs
in
a
big
bandbox
than
trust
myself
to
these
ignorant
hands
it
is
a
great
misfortune
to
a
town
if
it
has
been
disappointed
in
its
milliner
you
are
quite
at
her
mercy
and
worse
than
all
liable
to
entire
social
misapprehension
when
you
venture
far
from
home
so
bonnets
are
not
a
question
of
free
will
and
individual
responsibility
asked
the
doctor
soberly
i
must
say
that
i
have
wondered
sometimes
if
the
women
do
not
draw
lots
for
them
but
what
shall
i
do
about
the
little
girl
i
am
afraid
i
do
her
great
injustice
in
trying
to
bring
her
up
at
all
it
needs
a
woman
eye
your
eye
is
just
as
good
as
anybody
responded
graham
quickly
lest
the
doctor
should
drift
into
sad
thought
about
his
young
wife
who
had
been
so
long
dead
and
yet
seemed
always
a
nearer
and
dearer
living
presence
to
him
he
was
apt
to
say
a
word
or
two
about
her
and
not
answer
the
next
question
which
was
put
to
him
and
presently
go
silently
away
but
graham
had
important
business
in
hand
my
daughter
will
be
here
next
week
she
observed
presently
and
i
sure
that
she
will
do
any
shopping
for
you
in
boston
with
great
pleasure
we
might
forestall
marilla
plans
you
could
easily
say
when
you
go
home
that
you
have
spoken
to
me
about
it
i
think
it
would
be
an
excellent
opportunity
now
while
the
east
road
establishment
is
in
disfavor
and
when
the
doctor
smiled
and
nodded
his
friend
and
hostess
settled
herself
comfortably
in
her
chair
and
felt
that
she
had
gained
a
point
the
sunshine
itself
could
hardly
have
made
that
south
parlor
look
pleasanter
there
was
a
log
in
the
fire
that
was
wet
and
singing
gently
to
itself
as
if
the
sound
of
the
summer
rustlings
and
chirpings
had
somehow
been
stored
away
in
its
sap
and
above
it
were
some
pieces
of
drier
white
birch
which
were
sending
up
a
yellow
conflagration
to
keep
the
marauding
from
coming
down
the
chimney
the
geraniums
looked
brighter
than
by
daylight
and
seemed
to
hold
their
leaves
toward
the
fireplace
as
if
they
were
hands
and
were
even
leaning
out
a
little
way
themselves
and
lifting
their
blossoms
like
torches
as
if
they
were
a
reserve
force
a
little
garrison
of
weaker
soldiers
who
were
also
enemies
of
the
cold
the
gray
twilight
was
gathering
out
of
doors
the
trees
looked
naked
and
defenceless
as
one
saw
them
through
the
windows
graham
tapped
the
arms
of
her
chair
gently
with
the
tips
of
her
fingers
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
doctor
closed
the
book
he
was
looking
over
and
announced
that
the
days
were
growing
very
short
there
was
something
singularly
pleasant
to
both
the
friends
in
their
quiet
sunday
afternoon
companionship
you
used
to
pay
me
a
sunday
visit
every
week
said
the
old
lady
pleased
to
find
that
her
guest
still
lingered
i
do
know
why
but
i
always
have
a
hope
that
you
will
find
time
to
run
over
for
half
an
hour
i
said
to
myself
yesterday
that
a
figure
of
me
in
wax
would
do
just
as
well
as
anything
nowadays
i
get
up
and
dress
myself
and
make
the
journey
downstairs
and
sit
here
at
the
window
and
have
my
dinner
and
go
through
the
same
round
day
after
day
if
it
were
for
a
certain
amount
of
expense
it
incurs
and
occupation
to
other
people
i
think
it
would
be
of
very
little
use
however
there
are
some
people
still
left
who
need
me
who
is
it
says
béranger
perhaps
that
to
love
benefits
one
self
and
to
inspire
love
benefits
others
i
like
to
think
that
the
children
and
grandchildren
have
the
old
place
to
think
of
and
come
back
to
i
can
see
that
it
is
a
great
bond
between
them
all
and
that
is
very
good
i
begin
to
feel
like
a
very
old
woman
it
would
be
quite
different
you
know
if
i
were
active
and
busy
out
of
doors
and
the
bustling
sort
of
person
for
which
nature
intended
me
as
it
is
my
mind
is
bustling
enough
for
itself
and
its
body
both
well
said
the
doctor
laughing
a
little
what
is
it
now
the
little
girl
answered
graham
gravely
i
think
it
is
quite
time
she
knew
something
of
society
do
tell
yourself
that
i
am
notional
and
frivolous
i
know
you
have
put
a
great
deal
of
hope
and
faith
and
affection
into
that
child
career
it
would
disappoint
you
dreadfully
if
she
were
not
interesting
and
harmonious
to
people
in
general
it
seems
a
familiar
fact
now
that
she
should
have
come
to
live
with
you
that
she
should
be
growing
up
in
your
house
but
the
first
thing
we
know
she
will
be
a
young
lady
instead
of
an
amusing
child
and
i
think
that
you
can
not
help
seeing
that
a
great
deal
of
responsibility
belongs
to
you
she
must
be
equipped
and
provisioned
for
the
voyage
of
life
she
must
have
some
resources
but
i
think
she
has
more
than
most
children
yes
yes
i
dare
say
she
is
a
bright
little
creature
but
her
brightness
begins
to
need
new
things
to
work
upon
she
does
very
well
at
school
now
i
hear
and
she
minds
very
well
and
is
much
less
lawless
than
she
used
to
be
but
she
is
like
a
candle
that
refuses
to
burn
and
is
satisfied
with
admiring
its
candlestick
she
is
quite
the
queen
of
the
village
children
in
one
way
and
in
another
she
is
quite
apart
from
them
i
believe
they
envy
her
and
look
upon
her
as
being
of
another
sort
and
yet
count
her
out
of
half
their
plans
and
pleasures
and
she
runs
home
not
knowing
whether
to
be
pleased
or
hurt
and
pulls
down
half
a
dozen
of
your
books
and
sits
proudly
at
the
window
her
poor
foolish
mother
had
some
gifts
but
she
went
adrift
very
soon
and
i
should
teach
nan
her
duty
to
her
neighbor
and
make
her
take
in
the
idea
that
she
owes
something
to
the
world
beside
following
out
her
own
most
satisfying
plans
when
i
was
a
young
woman
it
was
a
most
blessed
discovery
to
me
though
i
was
not
any
quicker
at
making
it
than
other
people
perhaps
that
beside
being
happy
myself
and
valuable
to
myself
i
must
fit
myself
into
my
place
in
society
we
are
seldom
left
to
work
alone
you
know
no
not
even
you
i
know
too
much
about
you
to
believe
that
and
it
is
enough
that
we
are
willing
to
talk
about
ourselves
we
must
learn
to
understand
the
subjects
of
the
day
that
everybody
talks
about
and
to
make
sure
of
a
right
to
stand
upon
the
highest
common
ground
wherever
we
are
society
is
a
sort
of
close
corporation
and
we
must
know
its
watchwords
and
keep
an
interest
in
its
interests
and
affairs
i
call
a
gentleman
the
man
who
either
by
birth
or
by
nature
belongs
to
the
best
society
there
may
be
bad
gentlemen
and
good
gentlemen
but
one
must
feel
instinctively
at
home
with
a
certain
class
representatives
of
which
are
likely
to
be
found
everywhere
and
as
for
nan
you
will
be
disappointed
if
she
does
not
understand
a
little
later
your
own
way
of
looking
at
things
she
must
grow
up
full
of
whims
and
indifferences
i
am
too
fond
of
you
to
look
forward
calmly
to
your
being
disappointed
and
i
do
believe
she
will
be
a
most
lovely
daughterly
friendly
girl
who
will
keep
you
from
being
lonely
as
you
grow
older
and
be
a
great
blessing
in
every
way
yet
she
has
a
strange
history
and
is
in
a
strange
position
i
hope
you
will
find
a
good
school
for
her
before
very
long
this
was
said
after
a
moment
pause
and
with
considerable
hesitation
and
graham
was
grateful
for
the
gathering
darkness
which
sheltered
her
and
not
a
little
surprised
at
the
answer
i
have
been
thinking
of
that
he
said
quickly
but
it
is
a
great
puzzle
at
present
and
i
am
thankful
to
say
i
think
it
is
quite
safe
to
wait
a
year
or
two
yet
you
and
i
live
so
much
apart
from
society
that
we
idealize
it
a
good
deal
though
you
are
a
bit
of
it
we
too
seldom
see
the
ideal
gentleman
or
lady
we
have
to
be
contented
with
keeping
the
ideal
in
our
minds
it
seems
to
me
and
saying
that
this
man
is
gentlemanly
and
that
woman
ladylike
but
i
do
believe
in
aiming
at
the
best
things
and
turning
this
young
creature
good
instincts
and
uncommon
powers
into
the
proper
channels
instead
of
letting
her
become
singular
and
because
she
does
not
know
enough
of
people
of
her
own
sort
graham
gave
a
little
sound
of
approval
that
did
not
stand
for
any
word
in
particular
i
wonder
if
her
father
people
will
ever
make
any
claim
to
her
she
said
something
about
her
aunt
one
day
i
think
it
was
to
hear
whatever
i
might
answer
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
poor
child
had
more
pleasure
in
this
unknown
possession
than
was
worth
while
she
appeared
to
think
of
her
as
a
sort
of
fairy
godmother
who
might
descend
in
oldfields
at
any
moment
i
did
not
know
she
thought
of
her
at
all
announced
the
doctor
somewhat
dismayed
she
never
has
talked
about
her
aunt
to
me
i
dare
say
that
she
has
been
entertained
with
the
whole
miserable
story
oh
no
answered
graham
placidly
i
do
think
that
is
likely
but
it
is
quite
reasonable
that
the
child
should
be
aware
of
some
part
of
it
by
this
time
the
dyer
neighbors
are
far
from
being
reticent
good
creatures
and
they
have
little
to
remember
that
approaches
the
interest
and
excitement
of
that
time
do
you
know
anything
about
miss
prince
nowadays
i
have
not
heard
anything
of
her
in
a
long
while
she
still
sends
the
yearly
remittance
which
i
acknowledge
and
put
into
the
savings
bank
as
i
always
have
done
when
nan
came
to
me
i
advised
miss
prince
that
i
wished
to
assume
all
care
of
her
and
should
be
glad
if
she
would
give
me
entire
right
to
the
child
but
she
took
no
notice
of
the
request
it
really
makes
no
practical
difference
only
and
the
doctor
became
much
embarrassed
i
must
confess
that
i
have
a
notion
of
letting
her
study
medicine
by
and
by
if
she
shows
a
fitness
for
it
dear
dear
said
the
hostess
leaning
forward
so
suddenly
that
she
knocked
two
or
three
books
from
the
corner
of
the
table
and
feeling
very
much
excited
john
leslie
i
ca
believe
it
but
my
dear
man
used
to
say
you
thought
twice
for
everybody
else
once
what
can
have
decided
you
upon
such
a
plan
how
happened
the
judge
to
say
that
asked
the
doctor
trying
to
scoff
but
not
a
little
pleased
i
sure
i
ca
tell
you
graham
only
the
idea
has
grown
of
itself
in
my
mind
as
all
right
ideas
do
and
everything
that
i
can
see
seems
to
favor
it
you
may
think
that
it
is
too
early
to
decide
but
i
see
plainly
that
nan
is
not
the
sort
of
girl
who
will
be
likely
to
marry
when
a
man
or
woman
has
that
sort
of
and
unnatural
it
shows
itself
very
early
i
believe
that
it
is
a
mistake
for
such
a
woman
to
marry
nan
feeling
toward
her
is
exactly
the
same
as
toward
the
girls
she
knows
you
have
only
to
look
at
the
rest
of
the
children
together
to
see
the
difference
and
if
i
make
sure
by
and
by
the
law
of
her
nature
is
that
she
must
live
alone
and
work
alone
i
shall
help
her
to
keep
it
instead
of
break
it
by
providing
something
else
than
the
business
of
housekeeping
and
what
is
called
a
natural
work
for
her
activity
and
capacity
to
spend
itself
upon
but
do
you
think
that
a
married
life
is
happiest
urged
the
listener
a
good
deal
shocked
at
such
treason
yet
somewhat
persuaded
by
its
truth
yes
said
leslie
sadly
yes
indeed
for
most
of
us
we
could
say
almost
everything
for
that
side
you
and
i
but
a
rule
is
sometimes
very
cruel
for
its
exceptions
and
there
is
a
life
now
and
then
which
is
persuaded
to
put
itself
in
irons
by
the
force
of
custom
and
circumstances
and
from
the
lack
of
bringing
reason
to
bear
upon
the
solving
of
the
most
important
question
of
its
existence
of
course
i
do
feel
sure
yet
that
i
am
right
about
nan
but
looking
at
her
sad
inheritance
from
her
mother
and
her
good
inheritances
from
other
quarters
i
can
not
help
feeling
that
she
might
be
far
more
unhappy
than
to
be
made
ready
to
take
up
my
work
here
in
oldfields
when
i
have
to
lay
it
down
she
will
need
a
good
anchor
now
and
then
only
this
summer
she
had
a
bad
day
of
it
that
made
me
feel
at
my
wits
end
she
was
angry
with
one
of
the
children
at
school
and
afterward
with
marilla
because
she
scolded
her
for
not
keeping
better
account
of
the
family
times
and
seasons
and
ran
away
in
the
afternoon
if
you
please
and
was
not
heard
from
until
next
morning
at
breakfast
time
she
went
to
the
old
place
and
wandered
about
the
fields
as
she
used
and
crept
into
some
shelter
or
other
i
dare
say
that
she
climbed
in
at
one
of
the
windows
of
the
house
though
i
could
not
make
quite
sure
without
asking
more
questions
than
i
thought
worth
while
she
came
stealing
in
early
in
the
morning
looking
a
little
pale
and
wild
but
she
has
played
such
a
prank
since
i
had
a
call
to
the
next
town
and
marilla
had
evidently
been
awake
all
night
i
got
home
early
in
the
morning
myself
and
was
told
that
it
was
supposed
i
had
picked
up
nan
on
the
road
and
carried
her
with
me
so
the
blame
was
all
ready
for
my
shoulders
unless
we
had
both
happened
to
see
the
young
culprit
strolling
in
at
the
gate
i
was
glad
she
had
punished
herself
so
that
there
was
no
need
of
my
doing
it
though
i
had
a
talk
with
her
a
day
or
two
afterward
when
we
were
both
in
our
right
minds
she
is
a
good
child
enough
i
dare
say
remarked
graham
drily
but
it
seems
to
me
that
neither
of
you
took
marilla
sufficiently
into
account
that
must
have
been
the
evening
that
the
poor
soul
went
to
nearly
every
house
in
town
to
ask
if
there
were
any
stray
company
to
tea
some
of
us
could
not
help
wondering
where
the
young
person
was
finally
discovered
she
has
a
great
fancy
for
the
society
of
miss
betsy
milman
and
sally
turner
at
present
and
i
quite
sympathize
with
her
i
often
look
over
there
and
see
the
end
of
their
house
with
that
one
little
square
window
in
the
very
peak
of
it
spying
up
the
street
and
wish
i
could
pay
them
a
visit
myself
and
hear
a
bit
of
their
wise
gossip
i
quite
envy
nan
her
chance
of
going
in
and
being
half
forgotten
as
she
sits
in
one
of
their
short
chairs
listening
and
watching
they
used
to
be
great
friends
of
her
grandmother
oh
no
if
i
could
go
to
see
them
they
would
insist
upon
my
going
into
the
best
room
and
we
should
all
be
quite
uncomfortable
it
is
much
better
to
sit
here
and
think
about
them
and
hear
their
creak
away
over
the
little
jackets
and
trousers
i
must
confess
that
i
have
my
own
clothes
mended
there
to
this
day
said
the
doctor
marilla
says
their
mending
is
not
what
it
used
to
be
too
but
it
is
quite
good
enough
as
for
that
little
window
i
hardly
ever
see
it
without
remembering
the
day
of
your
aunt
funeral
i
was
only
a
boy
and
not
deeply
afflicted
but
of
course
i
had
my
place
in
the
procession
and
was
counted
among
the
mourners
and
as
we
passed
the
milman
place
i
saw
the
old
lady
face
up
there
just
filling
the
four
small
panes
you
know
she
was
almost
helpless
and
how
she
had
got
up
into
the
little
garret
i
can
not
imagine
but
she
was
evidently
determined
to
inspect
the
procession
as
it
went
down
the
lane
it
was
a
pity
they
did
not
cut
the
window
beneath
it
in
the
lower
room
in
her
day
you
know
what
an
odd
face
she
had
i
suppose
it
was
distorted
by
disease
and
out
of
all
shape
it
ever
knew
but
i
can
see
it
now
framed
in
with
its
cap
border
and
the
window
as
if
there
were
no
more
of
her
she
really
was
the
most
curious
old
creature
it
more
than
accounts
for
turner
and
miss
betsy
love
for
a
piece
of
news
said
graham
who
was
much
amused
but
i
wish
we
understood
the
value
of
these
old
people
so
much
local
history
and
tradition
must
die
with
every
one
of
them
if
we
take
no
pains
to
save
it
i
hope
you
are
wise
about
getting
hold
of
as
much
as
possible
you
doctors
ought
to
be
our
historians
for
you
alone
see
the
old
country
folks
familiarly
and
can
talk
with
them
without
restraint
but
we
have
time
to
do
any
writing
the
guest
replied
that
is
why
our
books
amount
to
so
little
for
the
most
part
the
active
men
who
are
really
to
be
depended
upon
as
practitioners
are
kept
so
busy
that
they
are
too
tired
to
use
the
separate
gift
for
writing
even
if
they
possess
it
which
many
do
not
and
the
literary
doctors
the
medical
scholars
are
a
different
class
who
have
not
had
the
experience
which
alone
can
make
their
advice
reliable
i
mean
of
course
in
practical
matters
not
anatomy
and
physiology
but
we
have
to
work
our
way
and
depend
upon
ourselves
we
country
doctors
to
whom
a
consultation
is
more
or
less
a
downfall
of
pride
whenever
i
hear
that
an
old
doctor
is
dead
i
sigh
to
think
what
treasures
of
wisdom
are
lost
instead
of
being
added
to
the
general
fund
that
was
one
advantage
of
putting
the
young
men
with
the
elder
practitioners
many
valuable
suggestions
were
handed
down
in
that
way
i
am
very
well
contented
with
my
doctor
said
graham
with
enthusiasm
at
this
first
convenient
opportunity
and
it
is
very
wise
of
you
all
to
keep
up
our
confidence
in
the
face
of
such
facts
as
these
you
can
hardly
have
the
heart
to
scold
any
more
about
the
malpractice
of
patients
when
we
believe
in
you
so
humbly
and
so
ignorantly
you
are
always
safe
though
for
our
consciences
are
usually
smarting
under
the
remembrance
of
some
transgression
which
might
have
hindered
you
if
it
did
not
poor
humanity
she
added
in
a
tone
of
compassion
it
has
to
grope
its
way
through
a
deal
of
darkness
the
doctor
sighed
but
he
was
uncommonly
restful
and
comfortable
in
the
large
before
the
fender
it
was
quite
dark
out
of
doors
now
and
the
fire
gave
all
the
light
that
was
in
the
room
presently
he
roused
himself
a
little
to
say
humanity
indeed
and
i
suppose
nobody
sees
the
failures
and
miseries
as
members
of
my
profession
do
there
will
be
more
and
more
sorrow
and
defeat
as
the
population
increases
and
competition
with
it
it
seems
to
me
that
to
excel
in
one
work
becomes
more
and
more
a
secondary
motive
to
do
a
great
deal
and
be
well
paid
for
it
ranks
first
one
feels
the
injury
of
such
purposes
even
in
oldfields
i
can
not
see
that
the
world
changes
much
i
often
wish
that
i
could
though
surely
not
in
this
way
said
the
lame
woman
from
her
seat
by
the
window
as
the
doctor
rose
to
go
away
i
find
my
days
piteously
alike
and
you
do
not
know
what
a
pleasure
this
talk
has
been
it
satisfies
my
hungry
mind
and
gives
me
a
great
deal
to
think
of
you
would
not
believe
what
an
appetite
i
had
oh
do
think
i
need
any
excuses
it
is
a
great
pleasure
to
see
you
drive
in
and
out
of
the
gate
and
i
like
to
see
your
lamp
coming
into
the
study
and
to
know
that
you
are
there
and
fond
of
me
but
winter
looked
very
long
and
life
very
short
before
you
came
in
this
afternoon
i
suppose
you
have
had
enough
of
society
for
one
day
so
i
shall
not
tell
you
what
i
mean
to
have
for
tea
but
next
sunday
night
i
shall
expect
you
to
come
and
bring
your
ward
will
you
please
ring
so
that
martha
will
bring
the
lights
i
should
like
to
send
nan
a
nice
letter
to
read
which
came
yesterday
from
my
little
in
rome
i
shall
be
so
glad
when
they
are
all
at
home
again
she
is
about
nan
age
you
know
i
must
see
to
it
that
they
make
friends
with
each
other
do
put
me
on
a
dusty
top
shelf
again
and
forget
me
for
five
or
six
weeks
laughed
the
hostess
as
her
guest
protested
and
lingered
a
minute
still
before
he
opened
the
door
you
wo
say
anything
of
my
confidences
at
which
graham
shakes
her
head
with
satisfactory
gravity
though
if
doctor
leslie
had
known
she
was
inwardly
much
amused
and
assured
herself
directly
that
she
hoped
to
hear
no
more
of
such
plans
how
could
he
tell
that
the
girl
herself
would
agree
to
them
and
whether
oldfields
itself
would
favor
nan
as
his
own
successor
and
its
medical
adviser
but
john
leslie
was
a
wise
man
with
a
great
power
of
holding
to
his
projects
he
really
must
be
kept
to
his
promise
of
a
weekly
visit
she
was
of
some
use
in
the
world
after
all
so
long
as
these
unprotected
neighbors
were
in
it
and
at
any
rate
she
had
gained
her
point
about
the
poor
child
clothes
as
for
the
doctor
he
found
the
outer
world
much
obscured
by
the
storm
and
hoped
that
nobody
would
need
his
services
that
night
as
he
went
stumbling
home
though
the
damp
and
clogging
snow
underfoot
he
felt
a
strange
pleasure
in
the
sight
of
a
small
round
head
at
the
front
study
window
between
the
glass
and
the
curtain
and
nan
came
to
open
the
door
for
him
while
marilla
whose
unwonted
sunday
afternoon
leisure
seemed
to
have
been
devoted
to
fragrant
experiments
in
cookery
called
in
pleased
tones
from
the
that
she
had
begun
to
be
afraid
he
was
going
to
stay
out
to
supper
it
was
somehow
much
more
homelike
than
it
used
to
be
the
doctor
told
himself
as
he
pushed
his
feet
into
the
slippers
which
had
been
waiting
before
the
fire
until
they
were
in
danger
of
being
scorched
and
before
marilla
had
announced
with
considerable
ceremony
that
tea
was
upon
the
table
he
had
assured
himself
that
it
had
been
a
very
pleasant
hour
or
two
at
graham
and
it
was
the
best
thing
in
the
world
for
both
of
them
to
see
something
of
each
other
for
the
little
girl
sake
he
must
try
to
keep
out
of
ruts
and
must
get
hold
of
somebody
outside
his
own
little
world
but
while
he
called
himself
an
old
fogy
and
other
impolite
names
he
was
conscious
of
a
grave
and
sweet
desire
to
make
the
child
life
a
successful
one
to
bring
out
what
was
in
her
own
mind
and
capacity
and
so
to
wisely
educate
her
to
give
her
a
place
to
work
in
and
wisdom
to
work
with
so
far
as
he
could
for
he
knew
better
than
most
men
that
it
is
the
people
who
can
do
nothing
who
find
nothing
to
do
and
the
secret
of
happiness
in
this
world
is
not
only
to
be
useful
but
to
be
forever
elevating
one
uses
some
one
must
be
intelligent
for
a
child
until
it
is
ready
to
be
intelligent
for
itself
and
he
told
himself
with
new
decision
that
he
must
be
wise
in
his
laws
for
nan
and
make
her
keep
them
else
she
never
would
be
under
the
grace
of
any
of
her
own
xi
new
outlooks
leslie
held
too
securely
the
affection
of
his
townspeople
to
be
in
danger
of
losing
their
regard
or
respect
yet
he
would
have
been
half
pained
and
half
amused
if
he
had
known
how
foolishly
his
plans
which
came
in
time
to
be
his
ward
also
were
smiled
and
frowned
upon
in
the
oldfields
houses
conformity
is
the
inspiration
of
much
virtue
if
we
keep
near
a
certain
humble
level
of
morality
and
achievement
our
neighbors
are
willing
to
let
us
slip
through
life
unchallenged
those
who
anticipate
the
opinions
and
decisions
of
society
must
expect
to
be
found
guilty
of
many
sins
there
was
not
one
of
the
young
village
people
so
well
known
as
the
doctor
little
girl
who
drove
with
him
day
by
day
and
with
whom
he
kept
such
delightful
and
trustful
companionship
if
she
had
been
asked
in
later
years
what
had
decided
her
to
study
not
only
her
profession
but
any
profession
it
would
have
been
hard
for
her
to
answer
anything
beside
the
truth
that
the
belief
in
it
had
grown
with
herself
there
had
been
many
reasons
why
it
seemed
unnecessary
there
was
every
prospect
that
she
would
be
rich
enough
to
place
her
beyond
the
necessity
of
she
could
have
found
occupation
in
simply
keeping
the
doctor
house
and
being
a
cordial
hostess
in
that
home
and
a
welcome
guest
in
other
people
she
was
already
welcome
everywhere
in
oldfields
but
in
spite
of
this
which
would
have
seemed
to
fill
the
hearts
and
lives
of
other
girls
it
seemed
to
her
like
a
fragment
of
her
life
and
duty
and
when
she
had
ordered
her
housekeeping
and
her
social
duties
there
was
a
restless
readiness
for
a
more
absorbing
duty
and
industry
and
as
the
years
went
by
all
her
desire
tended
in
one
direction
the
one
thing
she
cared
most
to
learn
increased
its
attraction
continually
and
though
one
might
think
the
purpose
of
her
guardian
had
had
its
influence
and
moulded
her
character
by
its
persistence
the
truth
was
that
the
wise
doctor
simply
followed
as
best
he
could
the
leadings
of
the
young
nature
itself
and
so
the
girl
grew
naturally
year
by
year
reaching
out
half
unconsciously
for
what
belonged
to
her
life
and
growth
being
taught
one
thing
more
than
all
that
her
duty
must
be
followed
eagerly
and
reverently
in
spite
of
the
adverse
reasons
which
tempted
and
sometimes
baffled
her
as
she
grew
older
she
was
to
understand
more
clearly
that
indecision
is
but
another
name
for
cowardice
and
weakness
a
habit
of
mind
that
quickly
increases
its
power
of
hindrance
she
had
the
faults
that
belonged
to
her
character
but
these
were
the
faults
of
haste
and
rashness
rather
than
the
more
hopeless
ones
of
obstinacy
or
a
lack
of
will
and
purpose
the
sunday
evening
with
graham
though
somewhat
formidable
at
first
to
our
heroine
became
quickly
one
of
her
dearest
pleasures
and
led
to
a
fast
friendship
between
the
kind
hostess
and
her
young
guest
soon
nan
gave
herself
eagerly
to
a
plan
of
spending
two
or
three
evenings
a
week
across
the
way
for
the
purpose
of
reading
aloud
sometimes
from
books
she
did
not
understand
but
oftener
from
books
of
her
own
choice
it
was
supposed
to
be
wholly
a
kindness
on
the
young
girl
part
and
graham
allowed
the
excuse
of
a
temporary
ailment
of
her
own
strong
and
useful
eyes
to
serve
until
neither
she
nor
nan
had
the
least
thought
of
giving
up
their
pleasant
habit
of
reading
together
and
to
this
willing
listener
nan
came
in
time
with
her
youthful
dreams
and
visions
of
future
prosperities
in
life
so
that
presently
graham
knew
many
things
which
would
have
surprised
the
doctor
who
on
the
other
hand
was
the
keeper
of
equally
amazing
and
treasured
confidences
of
another
sort
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
both
these
friends
but
most
especially
to
the
elderly
woman
that
nan
seemed
so
entirely
satisfied
with
their
friendship
the
busy
doctor
who
often
had
more
than
enough
to
think
and
worry
about
sometimes
could
spare
but
little
time
to
nan
for
days
together
but
her
other
companion
was
always
waiting
for
her
and
the
smile
was
always
ready
by
way
of
greeting
when
the
child
looked
eagerly
up
at
the
parlor
window
what
stories
of
past
days
and
memories
of
youth
and
of
friends
belonging
to
the
dear
lady
own
girlhood
were
poured
into
nan
delighted
ears
she
came
in
time
to
know
graham
own
immediate
ancestors
and
the
various
members
of
her
family
with
their
fates
and
fortunes
as
if
she
were
a
contemporary
and
was
like
another
grandchild
who
was
a
neighbor
and
beloved
crony
which
real
blessing
none
of
the
true
grandchildren
had
ever
been
lucky
enough
to
possess
she
formed
a
welcome
link
with
the
outer
world
did
little
nan
and
from
being
a
cheerful
came
at
last
to
paying
friendly
visits
in
the
neighborhood
to
carry
messages
and
assurances
and
from
all
these
daily
suggestions
of
courtesy
and
of
good
taste
and
high
breeding
and
helpful
fellowship
with
good
books
and
the
characters
in
their
stories
which
were
often
more
real
and
dear
and
treasured
in
her
thoughts
than
her
actual
fellow
townsfolk
nan
drew
much
pleasure
and
not
a
little
wisdom
at
any
rate
a
direction
for
which
she
would
all
her
life
be
thankful
it
would
have
been
surprising
if
her
presence
in
the
doctor
house
had
not
after
some
time
made
changes
in
it
but
there
was
no
great
difference
outwardly
except
that
she
gathered
some
trifling
possessions
which
sometimes
harmonized
and
as
often
did
not
with
the
household
gods
of
the
doctor
and
marilla
there
was
a
shy
sort
of
intercourse
between
nan
and
graham
grandchildren
but
it
was
not
very
valuable
to
any
of
the
young
people
at
first
the
country
child
being
too
old
and
full
of
experience
to
fellowship
with
the
youngest
and
too
unversed
in
the
familiar
machinery
of
their
social
life
to
feel
much
kinship
with
the
eldest
it
was
during
one
of
these
early
summer
visits
and
directly
after
a
which
marilla
had
proudly
projected
on
nan
account
that
leslie
suddenly
announced
that
he
meant
to
go
to
boston
for
a
few
days
and
should
take
nan
with
him
this
event
had
long
been
promised
but
had
seemed
at
length
like
the
promise
of
happiness
in
a
future
world
reasonably
certain
but
a
little
vague
and
distant
it
was
a
more
important
thing
than
anybody
understood
for
a
dear
and
familiar
chapter
of
life
was
ended
when
the
expectant
pair
drove
out
of
the
village
on
their
way
to
the
railway
station
as
another
had
been
closed
when
the
door
of
the
thacher
had
been
shut
and
padlocked
and
nan
had
gone
home
one
snowy
night
to
live
with
the
doctor
the
weather
at
any
rate
was
different
now
for
it
was
early
june
the
time
when
doctors
can
best
give
themselves
a
holiday
and
though
leslie
assured
himself
that
he
had
little
wish
to
take
the
journey
he
felt
it
quite
due
to
his
ward
that
she
should
see
a
little
more
of
the
world
and
happily
due
also
to
certain
patients
and
his
brother
physicians
that
he
should
visit
the
shops
and
some
bookstores
in
fact
there
were
a
good
many
important
errands
to
which
it
was
just
as
well
to
attend
in
person
but
he
watched
delighted
eyes
and
observed
her
lack
of
surprise
at
strange
sights
and
her
perfect
readiness
for
the
marvelous
with
great
amusement
he
was
touched
and
pleased
because
she
cared
most
for
what
had
concerned
him
to
be
told
where
he
lived
and
studied
and
to
see
the
places
he
had
known
best
roused
most
enthusiasm
an
afternoon
in
a
corner
of
the
at
the
athenæum
library
in
which
he
had
spent
delightful
hours
when
he
was
a
young
man
seemed
to
please
the
young
girl
more
than
anything
else
as
he
sat
beside
the
table
where
he
had
gathered
enough
books
and
papers
to
last
for
many
days
in
his
delight
at
taking
up
again
his
once
familiar
habit
nan
looked
on
with
sympathetic
eyes
or
watched
the
squirrels
in
the
trees
of
the
quiet
granary
burying
ground
which
seemed
to
her
like
a
bit
of
country
which
the
noisy
city
had
caught
and
imprisoned
now
that
she
was
fairly
out
in
the
world
she
felt
a
new
strange
interest
in
her
mysterious
aunt
for
it
was
this
hitherto
unknown
space
outside
the
borders
of
oldfields
to
which
her
father
and
his
people
belonged
and
as
a
charming
old
lady
went
by
in
a
pretty
carriage
the
child
gaze
followed
her
wistfully
as
she
and
the
doctor
were
walking
along
the
street
with
a
sudden
blaze
of
imagination
she
had
wished
those
pleasant
eyes
might
have
seen
the
likeness
to
her
father
of
which
she
had
been
sometimes
told
and
that
the
carriage
had
been
hurried
back
so
that
the
long
estrangement
might
be
ended
it
was
a
strange
thing
that
just
afterward
leslie
had
with
much
dismay
caught
sight
of
the
true
aunt
for
miss
anna
prince
of
dunport
had
also
seen
fit
to
make
one
of
her
rare
visits
to
boston
she
looked
dignified
and
stately
but
a
little
severe
as
she
went
down
the
side
street
away
from
them
nan
quick
eyes
had
noticed
already
the
difference
between
the
city
people
and
the
country
folks
and
would
have
even
recognized
a
certain
provincialism
in
her
father
sister
the
doctor
had
only
seen
miss
prince
once
many
years
before
but
he
had
known
her
again
with
instinctive
certainty
and
nan
did
not
guess
though
she
was
most
grateful
for
it
why
he
reached
for
her
hand
and
held
it
fast
as
they
walked
together
just
as
he
always
used
to
do
when
she
was
a
little
girl
she
was
not
yet
fully
grown
and
she
never
suspected
the
sudden
thrill
of
dread
and
consciousness
of
the
great
battle
of
life
which
she
must
soon
begin
to
fight
which
all
at
once
chilled
the
heart
it
a
cold
world
a
cold
world
he
had
said
to
himself
only
one
thing
will
help
her
through
safely
and
that
is
her
usefulness
she
shall
never
be
either
a
thief
or
a
beggar
of
the
world
favor
if
i
can
have
my
wish
and
nan
holding
his
hand
with
her
warm
soft
childish
one
looked
up
in
his
face
all
unconscious
that
he
thought
with
pity
how
unaware
she
was
of
the
years
to
come
and
of
their
difference
to
this
sunshine
holiday
and
yet
i
never
was
so
happy
at
her
age
as
i
am
this
summer
the
doctor
told
himself
by
way
of
cheer
they
paid
some
visits
together
to
leslie
friends
and
it
was
interesting
to
see
how
for
the
child
sake
he
resumed
his
place
among
these
acquaintances
to
whom
he
had
long
been
linked
either
personally
in
times
past
or
by
family
ties
he
was
sometimes
reproached
for
his
love
of
seclusion
and
cordially
welcomed
back
to
his
old
relations
but
as
often
found
it
impossible
to
restore
anything
but
a
formal
intercourse
of
a
most
temporary
nature
the
people
for
whom
he
cared
most
all
seemed
attracted
to
his
young
ward
and
he
noted
this
with
pleasure
though
he
had
not
recognized
the
fact
that
he
had
been
for
the
moment
basely
uncertain
whether
his
judgment
of
her
worth
would
be
confirmed
he
laughed
at
the
insinuation
that
he
had
made
a
hermit
or
an
outlaw
of
himself
he
would
have
been
still
more
amused
to
hear
one
of
his
old
friends
say
that
this
was
the
reason
they
had
seen
so
little
of
him
in
late
years
and
that
it
was
a
shame
that
a
man
of
his
talent
and
many
values
to
the
world
should
be
hiding
his
light
under
the
oldfields
bushel
and
all
for
the
sake
of
bringing
up
this
child
as
for
nan
she
had
little
to
say
but
kept
her
eyes
and
ears
wide
open
and
behaved
herself
discreetly
she
had
ceased
to
belong
only
to
the
village
she
had
left
in
these
days
she
became
a
citizen
of
the
world
at
large
her
horizon
had
suddenly
become
larger
and
she
might
have
discovered
more
than
one
range
of
mountains
which
must
be
crossed
as
the
years
led
her
forward
steadily
one
by
one
there
is
nothing
so
interesting
as
to
be
able
to
watch
the
change
and
progress
of
the
mental
and
moral
nature
provided
it
grows
eagerly
and
steadily
there
must
be
periods
of
repose
and
hibernation
like
the
winter
of
a
plant
and
in
its
springtime
the
living
soul
will
both
consciously
and
unconsciously
reach
out
for
new
strength
and
new
light
the
leaves
and
flowers
of
action
and
achievement
are
only
the
signs
of
the
vitality
that
works
within
xii
against
the
wind
during
the
next
few
years
while
nan
was
growing
up
oldfields
itself
changed
less
than
many
country
towns
of
its
size
though
some
faces
might
be
missed
or
altered
leslie
household
seemed
much
the
same
and
graham
a
little
thinner
and
older
but
more
patient
and
sweet
and
delightful
than
ever
sits
at
her
parlor
window
and
reads
new
books
and
old
ones
and
makes
herself
the
centre
of
much
love
and
happiness
she
and
the
doctor
have
grown
more
and
more
friendly
and
they
watch
the
young
girl
development
with
great
pride
they
look
forward
to
her
vacations
more
than
they
would
care
to
confess
even
to
each
other
and
when
she
comes
home
eager
and
gay
she
makes
both
these
dear
friends
feel
young
again
when
nan
is
not
there
to
keep
him
company
leslie
always
drives
and
has
grown
more
careful
about
the
comfort
of
his
carriages
though
he
tells
himself
with
great
pleasure
that
he
is
really
much
more
youthful
in
his
feelings
than
he
was
twenty
years
before
and
does
not
hesitate
to
say
openly
that
he
should
have
been
an
old
fogy
by
this
time
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
blessing
of
young
companionship
when
nan
is
pleased
to
command
he
is
always
ready
to
take
long
rides
and
the
two
saddles
are
brushed
up
and
they
wonder
why
the
bits
are
so
tarnished
and
she
holds
his
horse
bridle
while
he
goes
in
to
see
his
patients
and
is
ready
with
merry
talk
or
serious
questions
when
he
reappears
and
one
dark
night
she
listens
from
her
window
to
the
demand
of
a
messenger
and
softly
creeps
down
stairs
and
is
ready
to
take
her
place
by
his
side
and
drive
him
across
the
hills
as
if
it
were
the
best
fun
in
the
world
with
the
frightened
clattering
behind
on
his
steed
the
moon
rises
late
and
they
come
home
just
before
daybreak
and
though
the
doctor
tries
to
be
stern
as
he
says
he
can
not
have
such
a
piece
of
mischief
happen
again
he
wonders
how
the
girl
knew
that
he
had
dreaded
for
once
in
his
life
the
drive
in
the
dark
and
had
felt
a
little
less
strong
than
usual
marilla
still
reigns
in
noble
state
she
has
some
time
ago
accepted
a
colleague
after
a
preliminary
show
of
resentment
and
nan
has
little
by
little
infused
a
different
spirit
into
the
housekeeping
and
when
her
friends
come
to
pay
visits
in
the
vacations
they
find
the
old
home
a
very
charming
place
and
fall
quite
in
love
with
both
the
doctor
and
graham
before
they
go
away
marilla
always
kept
the
large
east
parlor
for
a
sacred
shrine
of
society
to
be
visited
chiefly
by
herself
as
guardian
priestess
but
nan
has
made
it
a
pleasanter
room
than
anybody
ever
imagined
possible
and
uses
it
with
a
freedom
which
appears
to
the
old
housekeeper
to
lack
consideration
and
respect
nan
makes
the
most
of
her
vacations
while
the
neighbors
are
all
glad
to
see
her
come
back
and
some
of
them
are
much
amused
because
in
summer
she
still
clings
to
her
childish
impatience
at
wearing
any
head
covering
and
no
matter
how
much
marilla
admires
the
hat
which
is
decorously
worn
to
church
every
sunday
morning
it
is
hardly
seen
again
except
by
chance
during
the
week
and
the
brown
hair
is
sure
to
be
faded
a
little
before
the
summer
sunshine
is
past
nan
goes
about
visiting
when
she
feels
inclined
and
seems
surprisingly
unchanged
as
she
seats
herself
in
one
of
the
dyer
kitchens
and
listens
eagerly
to
whatever
information
is
offered
or
answers
cordially
all
sorts
of
questions
whether
they
concern
her
own
experiences
or
the
world
in
general
she
has
never
yet
seen
her
father
sister
though
she
still
thinks
of
her
and
sometimes
with
a
strange
longing
for
an
evidence
of
kind
feeling
and
kinship
which
has
never
been
shown
this
has
been
chief
among
the
vague
sorrows
of
her
girlhood
yet
once
when
her
guardian
had
asked
if
she
wished
to
make
some
attempt
at
intercourse
or
conciliation
he
had
been
answered
with
a
scorn
and
decision
worthy
of
grandmother
thacher
herself
that
it
was
for
miss
prince
to
make
advances
if
she
ever
wished
for
either
the
respect
or
affection
of
her
niece
but
the
young
girl
has
clung
with
touching
affection
to
the
memory
and
association
of
her
childhood
and
again
and
again
sought
in
every
season
of
the
year
the
old
playgrounds
and
familiar
corners
of
the
farm
which
she
has
grown
fonder
of
as
the
months
go
by
the
inherited
attachment
of
generations
seems
to
have
been
centred
in
her
faithful
heart
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
summer
which
followed
the
close
of
her
was
for
the
most
part
very
unsatisfactory
her
had
been
more
than
usually
pleasant
and
rewarding
in
spite
of
the
sorrows
and
disappointments
and
unsolvable
puzzles
which
are
sure
to
trouble
thoughtful
girls
of
her
age
but
she
had
grown
so
used
at
last
to
living
by
rules
and
bells
that
she
could
not
help
feeling
somewhat
adrift
without
them
it
had
been
so
hard
to
put
herself
under
restraint
and
discipline
after
her
free
life
in
oldfields
that
it
was
equally
hard
for
a
while
to
find
herself
at
liberty
though
this
being
her
natural
state
she
welcomed
it
heartily
at
first
and
was
very
thankful
to
be
at
home
it
did
not
take
long
to
discover
that
she
had
no
longer
the
same
desire
for
her
childish
occupations
and
amusements
they
were
only
incidental
now
and
pertained
to
certain
moods
and
could
not
again
be
made
the
chief
purposes
of
her
life
she
hardly
knew
what
to
do
with
herself
and
sometimes
wondered
what
would
become
of
her
and
why
she
was
alive
at
all
as
she
longed
for
some
sufficient
motive
of
existence
to
catch
her
up
into
its
whirlwind
she
was
filled
with
energy
and
a
great
desire
for
usefulness
but
it
was
not
with
her
as
with
many
of
her
friends
that
the
natural
instinct
toward
marriage
and
the
building
and
keeping
of
a
sweet
ruled
all
other
plans
and
possibilities
her
best
wishes
and
hopes
led
her
away
from
all
this
and
however
tenderly
she
sympathized
in
other
people
happiness
and
recognized
its
inevitableness
for
herself
she
avoided
unconsciously
all
approach
or
danger
of
it
she
was
trying
to
climb
by
the
help
of
some
other
train
of
experiences
to
whatever
satisfaction
and
success
were
possible
for
her
in
this
world
if
she
had
been
older
and
of
a
different
nature
she
might
have
been
told
that
to
climb
up
any
other
way
toward
a
shelter
from
the
fear
of
worthlessness
and
mistake
and
reproach
would
be
to
prove
herself
in
most
people
eyes
a
thief
and
a
robber
but
in
these
days
she
was
not
fit
to
reason
much
about
her
fate
she
could
only
wait
for
the
problems
to
make
themselves
understood
and
for
the
whole
influence
of
her
character
and
of
the
preparatory
years
to
shape
and
signify
themselves
into
a
simple
chart
and
unmistakable
command
and
until
the
power
was
given
to
see
life
steadily
and
see
it
whole
she
busied
herself
aimlessly
with
such
details
as
were
evidently
her
duty
and
sometimes
following
the
right
road
and
often
wandering
from
it
in
willful
impatience
she
stumbled
along
more
or
less
unhappily
it
seemed
as
if
everybody
had
forgotten
nan
gift
and
love
for
the
great
profession
which
was
her
childish
delight
and
ambition
to
be
sure
she
had
studied
anatomy
and
physiology
with
eager
devotion
in
the
meagre
at
school
though
the
other
girls
had
grumbled
angrily
at
the
task
long
ago
when
nan
had
confided
to
her
dearest
cronies
that
she
meant
to
be
a
doctor
they
were
hardly
surprised
that
she
should
determine
upon
a
career
which
they
would
have
rejected
for
themselves
she
was
not
of
their
mind
and
they
believed
her
capable
of
doing
anything
she
undertook
yet
to
most
of
them
the
possible
and
even
probable
marriage
which
was
waiting
somewhere
in
the
future
seemed
to
hover
like
a
cloudy
barrier
over
the
realization
of
any
such
unnatural
plans
they
assured
themselves
that
their
showed
no
sign
of
being
the
sort
of
girl
who
tried
to
be
mannish
and
to
forsake
her
natural
vocation
for
a
profession
she
did
not
look
besides
she
had
no
need
to
work
for
her
living
this
ward
of
a
rich
man
who
was
altogether
the
most
brilliant
and
beautiful
girl
in
school
yet
everybody
knew
that
she
had
a
strange
tenacity
of
purpose
and
there
was
a
lack
of
pretension
and
a
simplicity
that
scorned
the
deceits
of
existence
everybody
knew
too
that
she
was
not
a
commonplace
girl
and
her
younger
friends
made
her
the
heroine
of
their
fondest
anticipations
and
dreams
but
after
all
it
seemed
as
if
everybody
even
the
girl
herself
had
lost
sight
of
the
once
familiar
idea
it
was
a
natural
thing
enough
that
she
should
have
become
expert
in
rendering
various
minor
services
to
the
patients
in
absence
and
sometimes
assist
him
when
no
other
person
was
at
hand
marilla
became
insensible
at
the
sight
of
the
least
dangerous
of
wounds
and
could
not
be
trusted
to
suggest
the
most
familiar
household
remedy
after
all
her
years
of
association
with
the
practice
of
medicine
and
it
was
considered
lucky
that
nan
had
some
aptness
for
such
services
in
her
childhood
she
had
been
nicknamed
the
little
doctor
by
the
household
and
even
a
few
familiar
friends
but
this
was
apparently
outgrown
though
her
guardian
had
more
than
once
announced
in
sudden
outbursts
of
enthusiasm
that
she
already
knew
more
than
most
of
the
people
who
tried
to
practice
medicine
they
once
in
a
while
talked
about
some
suggestion
or
discovery
which
was
attracting
leslie
attention
but
the
girl
seemed
hardly
to
have
gained
much
interest
even
for
this
and
became
a
little
shy
of
being
found
with
one
of
the
medical
books
in
her
hand
as
she
tried
to
fancy
herself
in
sympathy
with
the
conventional
world
of
school
and
of
the
ideas
of
society
and
yet
her
inward
sympathy
with
a
doctor
and
a
surgeon
work
grew
stronger
and
stronger
though
she
dismissed
reluctantly
the
possibility
of
following
her
bent
in
any
formal
way
since
after
all
her
world
had
seemed
to
forbid
it
as
the
time
drew
near
for
her
to
be
ended
she
tried
to
believe
that
she
should
be
satisfied
with
her
oldfields
life
she
was
fond
of
reading
and
she
had
never
lacked
employment
besides
she
wished
to
prove
herself
an
intelligent
companion
to
leslie
whom
she
loved
more
and
more
dearly
as
the
years
went
by
there
had
been
a
long
time
of
reserve
between
her
childish
freedom
of
intercourse
with
him
and
the
last
year
or
two
when
they
had
begun
to
speak
freely
to
each
other
as
friend
to
friend
it
was
a
constant
surprise
and
pleasure
to
the
doctor
when
he
discovered
that
his
former
plaything
was
growing
into
a
charming
companion
who
often
looked
upon
life
from
the
same
standpoint
as
himself
and
who
had
her
own
outlooks
upon
the
world
from
whence
she
was
able
to
give
him
by
no
means
worthless
intelligence
and
after
the
were
over
he
was
not
amazed
to
find
how
restless
and
dissatisfied
the
girl
was
how
impossible
it
was
for
her
to
content
herself
with
following
the
round
of
household
duties
which
were
supposed
to
content
young
women
of
her
age
and
station
even
if
she
tried
to
pay
visits
or
receive
them
from
her
friends
or
to
go
on
with
her
studies
or
to
review
some
of
which
she
had
been
fond
there
was
no
motive
for
it
it
all
led
to
nothing
it
began
for
no
reason
and
ended
in
no
use
as
she
exclaimed
one
day
most
dramatically
poor
nan
hurried
through
her
house
business
or
neglected
it
as
the
case
might
be
greatly
to
surprise
and
scorn
for
the
girl
had
always
proved
herself
diligent
and
interested
in
the
home
affairs
more
and
more
she
puzzled
herself
and
everybody
about
her
and
as
the
days
went
by
she
spent
them
out
of
doors
at
the
old
farm
or
on
the
river
or
in
taking
long
rides
on
a
young
horse
a
bargain
the
doctor
had
somewhat
repented
before
he
found
that
nan
was
helped
through
some
of
her
troubled
hours
by
the
creature
wildness
and
fleetness
it
was
very
plain
that
his
ward
was
adrift
and
at
first
the
doctor
suggested
farther
study
of
latin
or
chemistry
but
afterward
philosophically
resigned
himself
to
patience
feeling
certain
that
some
indication
of
the
right
course
would
not
be
long
withheld
and
that
a
wind
from
the
right
quarter
would
presently
fill
the
flapping
sails
of
this
idle
young
craft
and
send
it
on
its
way
one
afternoon
nan
went
hurrying
out
of
the
house
just
after
dinner
and
the
doctor
saw
that
her
face
was
unusually
troubled
he
had
asked
her
if
she
would
like
to
drive
with
him
to
a
farm
just
beyond
the
dyers
later
in
the
day
but
for
a
wonder
she
had
refused
leslie
gave
a
little
sigh
as
he
left
the
table
and
presently
watched
her
go
down
the
street
as
he
stood
by
the
window
it
would
be
very
sad
if
the
restlessness
and
discord
of
her
poor
mother
should
begin
to
show
themselves
again
he
could
not
bear
to
think
of
such
an
inheritance
but
nan
thought
little
of
anybody
else
discomforts
as
she
hurried
along
the
road
she
only
wished
to
get
to
the
beloved
farm
and
to
be
free
there
from
questions
and
from
the
evidences
of
her
unfitness
for
the
simple
duties
which
life
seemed
offering
her
with
heartless
irony
she
was
not
good
for
anything
after
all
it
appeared
and
she
had
been
cheating
herself
this
was
no
life
at
all
this
fretful
idleness
if
only
she
had
been
trained
as
boys
are
to
the
work
of
their
lives
she
had
hoped
that
leslie
would
help
her
he
used
to
talk
long
ago
about
her
studying
medicine
but
he
must
have
forgotten
that
and
the
girl
savagely
rebuked
society
in
general
for
her
unhappiness
of
course
she
could
keep
the
house
but
it
was
kept
already
any
one
with
five
senses
and
good
health
like
hers
could
prove
herself
able
to
do
any
of
the
ordinary
work
of
existence
for
her
part
it
was
not
enough
to
be
waited
upon
and
made
comfortable
she
wanted
something
more
to
be
really
of
use
in
the
world
and
to
do
work
which
the
world
needed
where
the
main
road
turned
eastward
up
the
hills
a
footpath
already
familiar
to
the
reader
shortened
the
distance
to
the
farm
and
the
young
girl
quickly
crossed
the
rude
stile
and
disappeared
among
the
underbrush
walking
bareheaded
with
the
swift
steps
of
a
creature
whose
home
was
in
some
such
place
as
this
often
the
dry
twigs
fallen
from
the
gray
lower
branches
of
the
pines
crackled
and
snapped
under
her
feet
or
the
bushes
rustled
backed
again
to
their
places
after
she
pushed
against
them
in
passing
she
hurried
faster
and
faster
going
first
through
the
dense
woods
and
then
out
into
the
sunlight
once
or
twice
in
the
open
ground
she
stopped
and
knelt
quickly
on
the
soft
turf
or
moss
to
look
at
a
little
plant
while
the
birds
which
she
startled
came
back
to
their
places
directly
as
if
they
had
been
quick
to
feel
that
this
was
a
friend
and
not
an
enemy
though
disguised
in
human
shape
at
last
nan
reached
the
fence
of
the
farm
and
leaped
over
it
and
fairly
ran
to
the
where
she
went
straight
to
one
of
the
cedars
and
threw
herself
upon
it
as
if
it
were
a
couch
while
she
sat
there
breathing
fast
and
glowing
with
bright
color
the
river
sent
a
fresh
breeze
by
way
of
messenger
and
the
old
cedar
held
its
many
branches
above
her
and
around
her
most
comfortably
and
sheltered
her
as
it
had
done
many
times
before
it
need
not
have
envied
other
trees
the
satisfaction
of
climbing
straight
upward
in
a
single
aspiration
of
growth
and
presently
nan
told
herself
that
there
was
nothing
like
a
good
run
she
looked
to
and
fro
along
the
river
and
listened
to
the
which
tinkled
lazily
in
the
pasture
behind
her
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
to
see
if
a
favorite
young
birch
tree
had
suffered
no
harm
for
it
grew
close
by
the
path
in
which
the
cattle
came
down
to
drink
so
she
rested
in
the
old
playground
unconscious
that
she
had
been
following
her
mother
footsteps
or
that
fate
had
again
brought
her
here
for
a
great
decision
years
before
the
miserable
suffering
woman
who
had
wearily
come
to
this
place
to
end
their
lives
had
turned
away
that
the
child
might
make
her
own
choice
between
the
good
and
evil
things
of
life
though
nan
told
herself
that
she
must
make
it
plain
how
she
could
spend
her
time
in
oldfields
to
good
purpose
and
be
of
most
use
at
home
and
must
get
a
new
strength
for
these
duties
a
decision
suddenly
presented
itself
to
her
with
a
force
of
reason
and
necessity
the
old
dream
of
it
had
never
shown
why
should
it
not
be
a
reality
that
she
studied
medicine
the
thought
entirely
possessed
her
and
the
glow
of
excitement
and
enthusiasm
made
her
spring
from
the
cedar
boughs
and
laugh
aloud
her
whole
heart
went
out
to
this
work
and
she
wondered
why
she
had
ever
lost
sight
of
it
she
was
sure
this
was
the
way
in
which
she
could
find
most
happiness
god
had
directed
her
at
last
and
though
the
opening
of
her
sealed
orders
had
been
long
delayed
the
suspense
had
only
made
her
surer
that
she
must
hold
fast
this
unspeakably
great
motive
something
to
work
for
with
all
her
might
as
long
as
she
lived
people
might
laugh
or
object
nothing
should
turn
her
aside
and
a
new
affection
for
kind
and
patient
leslie
filled
her
mind
how
eager
he
had
been
to
help
her
in
all
her
projects
so
far
and
yet
it
was
asking
a
great
deal
that
he
should
favor
this
he
had
never
seemed
to
show
any
suspicion
that
she
would
not
live
on
quietly
at
home
like
other
girls
but
while
nan
told
herself
that
she
would
give
up
any
plan
even
this
if
he
could
convince
her
that
it
would
be
wrong
still
her
former
existence
seemed
like
a
fog
and
uncertainty
of
death
from
which
she
had
turned
away
this
time
of
her
own
accord
toward
a
great
light
of
satisfaction
and
certain
safety
and
helpfulness
the
doctor
would
know
how
to
help
her
if
she
only
could
study
with
him
that
would
be
enough
and
away
she
went
hurrying
down
the
as
if
she
were
filled
with
a
new
life
and
happiness
she
startled
a
brown
rabbit
from
under
a
bush
and
made
him
a
grave
salutation
when
he
stopped
and
lifted
his
head
to
look
at
her
from
a
convenient
distance
once
she
would
have
stopped
and
seated
herself
on
the
grass
to
amaze
him
with
courteous
attempts
at
friendliness
but
now
she
only
laughed
again
and
went
quickly
down
the
steep
bank
through
the
junipers
and
then
hurried
along
the
pebbly
margin
of
the
stream
toward
the
village
she
smiled
to
see
lying
side
by
side
a
flint
arrowhead
and
a
bobbin
that
had
floated
down
from
one
of
the
mills
and
gave
one
a
toss
over
the
water
while
she
put
the
other
in
her
pocket
her
thoughts
were
busy
enough
and
though
some
reasons
against
the
carrying
out
of
her
plan
ventured
to
assert
themselves
they
had
no
hope
of
carrying
the
day
being
in
piteous
minority
though
she
considered
them
one
by
one
by
and
by
she
came
into
the
path
again
and
as
she
reached
the
stile
she
was
at
first
glad
and
then
sorry
to
see
the
doctor
coming
along
the
high
road
from
the
donnell
farm
she
was
a
little
dismayed
at
herself
because
she
had
a
sudden
disinclination
to
tell
this
good
friend
her
secret
but
leslie
greeted
her
most
cheerfully
giving
her
the
reins
when
she
had
climbed
into
the
wagon
and
they
talked
of
the
weather
and
of
the
next
day
plans
as
they
drove
home
together
the
girl
felt
a
sense
of
guilt
and
a
shameful
lack
of
courage
but
she
was
needlessly
afraid
that
her
happiness
might
be
spoiled
by
a
word
from
that
quarter
that
very
evening
it
was
raining
outside
and
the
doctor
and
nan
were
sitting
in
the
library
opposite
each
other
at
the
and
as
they
answered
some
letters
in
order
to
be
ready
for
the
early
morning
post
they
stole
a
look
at
each
other
now
and
then
the
doctor
laid
down
his
pen
first
and
presently
as
nan
with
a
little
sigh
threw
hers
into
the
tray
beside
it
he
reached
forward
to
where
there
was
one
of
the
few
uncovered
spaces
of
the
dark
wood
of
the
table
and
drew
his
finger
across
it
they
both
saw
the
shining
surface
much
more
clearly
and
as
the
dusty
finger
was
held
up
and
examined
carefully
by
its
owner
the
girl
tried
to
laugh
and
then
found
her
voice
trembling
as
she
said
i
believe
i
have
forgotten
to
put
the
table
in
order
before
i
have
tried
to
take
care
of
the
study
at
any
rate
nan
dear
it
is
the
least
matter
in
the
world
said
leslie
i
think
we
are
a
little
chilly
here
this
damp
night
suppose
you
light
the
fire
at
any
rate
it
will
clear
away
all
those
envelopes
and
newspaper
wrappers
and
he
turned
his
so
that
it
faced
the
fireplace
and
watched
the
young
girl
as
she
moved
about
the
room
she
lifted
one
of
the
large
sticks
and
stood
it
on
one
end
at
the
side
of
the
hearth
and
the
doctor
noticed
that
she
did
it
less
easily
than
usual
and
without
the
old
strength
and
alertness
he
had
sprung
up
to
help
her
just
too
late
but
she
had
indignantly
refused
any
assistance
with
a
half
pettishness
that
was
not
a
common
mood
with
her
i
do
see
why
jane
or
marilla
or
whoever
it
was
put
that
heavy
log
on
at
this
time
of
the
year
said
leslie
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
solemn
consequence
by
this
time
he
had
lighted
a
fresh
cigar
and
nan
had
brought
her
little
wooden
chair
from
some
corner
of
the
room
where
it
had
always
lived
since
it
came
with
her
from
the
farm
it
was
a
dear
little
thing
but
quite
too
small
for
its
owner
who
had
grown
up
tall
and
straight
but
who
had
felt
a
sudden
longing
to
be
a
child
again
as
she
quietly
took
her
place
before
the
fire
that
log
she
said
i
wonder
if
you
will
never
learn
that
we
must
not
burn
it
i
saw
marilla
myself
when
she
climbed
the
highest
at
the
farther
end
of
the
for
it
i
suppose
all
the
time
i
have
been
away
you
have
been
remorselessly
burning
up
the
show
logs
i
do
wonder
at
her
telling
me
this
very
morning
that
she
was
born
to
suffer
and
suffer
she
supposed
she
must
we
never
used
to
be
allowed
to
put
papers
in
the
fireplace
but
you
have
gained
ever
so
many
liberties
i
wonder
if
marilla
really
thinks
she
has
had
a
hard
life
the
girl
said
in
a
different
tone
i
wonder
if
you
think
yours
is
hard
too
asked
the
doctor
and
nan
did
not
know
at
first
what
to
say
the
bright
light
of
the
burning
papers
and
the
kindlings
suddenly
faded
out
and
the
study
seemed
dark
and
strange
by
contrast
but
the
doctor
did
not
speak
either
he
only
bent
towards
her
presently
and
put
his
hand
on
the
top
of
the
girl
head
and
stroked
the
soft
hair
once
or
twice
and
then
gently
turned
it
until
he
could
see
nan
face
her
eyes
met
his
frankly
as
ever
but
they
were
full
of
tears
yes
she
said
i
wish
you
would
talk
to
me
i
wish
you
would
give
me
a
great
scolding
i
never
needed
it
so
much
in
my
life
i
meant
to
come
home
and
be
very
good
and
do
everything
i
could
to
make
you
happy
but
it
all
grows
worse
every
day
i
thought
at
first
i
was
tired
with
the
last
days
of
school
but
it
is
something
more
than
that
i
wish
in
the
least
that
i
were
back
at
school
but
i
ca
understand
anything
there
is
something
in
me
that
wants
to
be
busy
and
find
anything
to
do
i
do
mean
to
be
discontented
i
do
want
to
be
anywhere
else
in
the
world
there
is
enough
to
do
answered
the
doctor
as
placidly
as
possible
for
this
was
almost
the
first
time
he
had
noticed
distinctly
the
mother
nature
in
her
daughter
a
restless
impatient
miserable
sort
of
longing
for
the
great
something
else
as
ferris
had
once
called
it
do
fret
yourself
nan
yours
is
a
sorrow
for
if
you
have
any
conscience
at
all
about
doing
your
work
you
will
be
sure
enough
to
find
it
i
think
i
have
found
it
at
last
but
i
do
know
whether
any
one
else
will
agree
with
me
half
whispered
poor
nan
while
the
doctor
in
spite
of
himself
of
his
age
and
experience
and
sympathy
and
could
not
resist
a
smile
i
hate
to
talk
about
myself
or
to
be
sentimental
but
i
want
to
throw
my
whole
love
and
life
into
whatever
there
is
waiting
for
me
to
do
and
i
began
to
be
afraid
i
had
missed
it
somehow
once
i
thought
i
should
like
to
be
a
teacher
and
come
back
here
when
i
was
through
school
and
look
after
the
village
children
i
had
such
splendid
ideas
about
that
but
they
all
faded
out
i
went
into
the
one
day
and
i
thought
i
would
rather
die
than
be
shut
up
there
from
one
week
end
to
another
no
said
leslie
with
grave
composure
no
i
do
feel
sure
that
you
would
do
well
to
make
a
teacher
of
yourself
i
wish
that
i
had
known
when
school
was
over
that
i
must
take
care
of
myself
as
one
or
two
of
the
girls
meant
to
do
and
sometimes
it
seems
as
if
i
ought
said
nan
after
a
silence
of
a
few
minutes
and
this
time
it
was
very
hard
to
speak
you
have
been
so
kind
and
have
done
so
much
for
me
i
supposed
at
first
there
was
money
enough
of
my
own
but
i
know
now
dear
child
the
doctor
exclaimed
you
will
never
know
unless
you
are
left
alone
as
i
was
what
a
blessing
it
is
to
have
somebody
to
take
care
of
and
to
love
i
have
put
you
in
the
place
of
my
own
little
child
and
have
watched
you
grow
up
here
with
more
thankfulness
every
year
do
ever
say
another
word
to
me
about
the
money
part
of
it
what
had
i
to
spend
money
for
and
now
i
hear
you
say
all
these
despairing
things
but
i
am
an
old
man
and
i
take
them
for
what
they
are
worth
you
have
a
few
hard
months
before
you
perhaps
but
before
you
know
it
they
will
be
over
with
do
worry
yourself
look
after
marilla
a
little
and
that
new
and
drive
about
with
me
i
must
be
on
the
road
all
day
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
must
think
over
one
or
two
of
my
cases
before
i
go
to
bed
wo
you
hand
me
my
old
prescription
book
i
was
trying
to
remember
something
as
i
came
home
nan
went
to
find
the
book
while
leslie
puffing
his
very
fast
looked
up
through
the
cloud
abstractedly
at
a
new
ornament
which
had
been
placed
above
the
mantel
shelf
since
we
first
knew
the
room
old
captain
finch
had
solaced
his
weary
and
painful
last
years
by
making
a
beautiful
little
model
of
a
ship
and
had
left
it
in
his
will
to
the
doctor
there
never
was
a
more
touching
gift
this
present
owner
often
thought
and
he
had
put
it
in
its
place
with
reverent
hands
a
comparison
of
the
two
lives
came
stealing
into
his
mind
and
he
held
the
worn
a
minute
before
he
opened
it
the
poor
old
captain
waiting
to
be
released
stranded
on
the
inhospitable
shore
of
this
world
and
eager
nan
who
was
sorrowfully
longing
for
the
world
war
to
begin
two
idle
heroes
thought
leslie
and
i
neither
wished
to
give
one
his
discharge
nor
the
other
her
commission
but
he
said
aloud
nan
we
will
take
a
six
start
in
the
morning
and
go
down
through
the
sandy
plains
before
the
heat
begins
i
am
afraid
it
will
be
one
of
the
worst
of
the
yes
answered
nan
eagerly
and
then
she
came
close
to
the
doctor
and
looked
at
him
a
moment
before
she
spoke
while
her
face
shone
with
delight
i
am
going
to
be
a
doctor
too
i
have
thought
it
would
be
the
best
thing
in
the
world
ever
since
i
can
remember
the
little
was
the
match
that
lit
the
fire
but
i
have
been
wishing
to
tell
you
all
the
evening
we
must
ask
marilla
the
doctor
began
to
say
and
tried
to
add
what
she
think
but
nan
hardly
heard
him
and
did
not
laugh
at
his
jokes
for
she
saw
by
his
face
that
there
was
no
need
of
teasing
and
she
assured
herself
that
if
he
thought
it
was
only
a
freak
of
which
she
would
soon
tire
she
was
quite
willing
to
be
put
to
the
proof
next
morning
for
a
wonder
nan
waked
early
even
before
the
birds
had
quite
done
singing
and
it
seemed
a
little
strange
that
the
weather
should
be
clear
and
bright
and
almost
like
june
since
she
was
a
good
deal
troubled
she
felt
at
first
as
if
there
were
some
unwelcome
duty
in
her
work
and
then
remembered
the
early
drive
with
great
pleasure
but
the
next
minute
the
great
meaning
and
responsibility
of
the
decision
she
had
announced
the
evening
before
burst
upon
her
mind
and
a
flood
of
reasons
assailed
her
why
she
should
not
keep
to
so
uncommon
a
purpose
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
the
first
volume
of
life
was
ended
and
as
if
it
had
been
deceitfully
easy
since
she
had
been
led
to
this
point
it
amazed
her
to
find
the
certainty
take
possession
of
her
mind
that
her
vocation
had
been
made
ready
for
her
from
the
beginning
she
had
the
feeling
of
a
reformer
a
radical
and
even
of
a
political
agitator
as
she
tried
to
face
her
stormy
future
in
that
summer
morning
loneliness
but
by
the
time
she
had
finished
her
early
breakfast
and
was
driving
out
of
the
gate
with
the
doctor
the
day
seemed
so
much
like
other
days
that
her
trouble
of
mind
almost
disappeared
though
she
had
known
instinctively
that
all
the
early
part
of
her
life
had
favored
this
daring
project
and
the
next
few
years
would
hinder
it
if
they
could
still
there
was
something
within
her
stronger
than
any
doubts
that
could
possibly
assail
her
and
instead
of
finding
everything
changed
as
one
always
expects
to
do
when
a
great
change
has
happened
to
one
self
the
road
was
so
familiar
and
the
condition
of
the
outer
world
so
harmonious
that
she
hardly
understood
that
she
had
opened
a
gate
and
shut
it
behind
her
between
that
day
and
its
yesterday
she
held
the
reins
and
the
doctor
was
apparently
in
a
most
commonplace
frame
of
mind
she
wished
he
would
say
something
about
their
talk
of
the
night
before
but
he
did
not
she
seemed
very
old
to
herself
older
than
she
ever
would
seem
again
perhaps
but
the
doctor
had
apparently
relapsed
into
their
old
relations
as
guardian
and
child
perhaps
he
thought
she
would
forget
her
decision
and
did
not
know
how
much
it
meant
to
her
he
was
quite
provoking
he
hurried
the
horse
himself
as
they
went
up
a
somewhat
steep
ascent
and
as
nan
touched
the
not
very
fleet
steed
with
the
whip
on
the
next
level
bit
of
road
she
was
reminded
that
it
was
a
very
hot
morning
and
that
they
had
a
great
way
to
drive
when
she
asked
what
was
the
matter
with
the
patient
they
were
on
their
way
to
see
she
was
answered
abruptly
that
he
suffered
from
a
complication
of
disorders
which
was
the
more
aggravating
because
nan
had
heard
this
answer
laughed
at
as
being
much
used
by
old
jackson
who
was
usually
unwilling
or
unable
to
commit
himself
to
a
definite
opinion
nan
fancied
herself
at
that
minute
already
a
member
of
the
profession
and
did
not
like
to
be
joked
with
in
such
a
fashion
but
she
tried
to
be
amused
which
generosity
was
appreciated
by
her
companion
better
than
she
knew
leslie
was
not
much
of
a
singer
but
he
presently
lifted
what
little
voice
he
had
and
began
to
favor
nan
with
a
not
very
successful
rendering
of
bonny
doon
every
minute
seemed
more
critical
to
the
girl
beside
him
and
she
thought
of
several
good
ways
to
enter
upon
a
discussion
of
her
great
subject
but
with
unusual
restraint
and
reserve
let
the
moments
and
the
miles
go
by
until
the
doctor
had
quickly
stepped
down
from
the
carriage
and
disappeared
within
his
patient
door
nan
old
custom
of
following
him
had
been
neglected
for
some
time
since
she
had
found
that
the
appearance
of
a
tall
young
woman
had
quite
a
different
effect
upon
a
household
from
that
of
a
little
child
she
had
formed
the
habit
of
carrying
a
book
with
her
on
the
long
drives
though
she
often
left
it
untouched
while
she
walked
up
and
down
the
country
roads
or
even
ventured
upon
excursions
as
far
afield
as
she
dared
while
the
doctor
made
his
visit
which
was
apt
to
be
a
long
one
in
the
lonely
country
houses
this
morning
she
had
possessed
herself
of
a
square
thin
volume
which
gave
lists
and
plates
of
the
nerve
system
of
the
human
body
the
doctor
had
nearly
laughed
aloud
when
he
caught
sight
of
it
and
when
nan
opened
it
with
decision
and
gravity
and
read
the
first
page
slowly
she
was
conscious
of
a
lack
of
interest
in
her
subject
she
had
lost
the
great
enthusiasm
of
the
night
before
and
felt
like
the
little
heap
of
ashes
which
such
a
burning
and
heroic
self
might
well
have
left
presently
she
went
strolling
down
the
road
gathering
some
large
leaves
on
her
way
and
stopped
at
the
brook
where
she
pulled
up
some
bits
of
a
strange
and
made
them
into
a
damp
round
bundle
with
the
leaves
and
a
bit
of
string
this
was
a
rare
plant
which
they
had
both
noticed
the
day
before
and
they
had
taken
some
specimens
then
nan
being
at
this
time
an
ardent
botanist
but
these
had
withered
and
been
lost
also
on
the
way
home
leslie
was
in
even
less
of
a
hurry
than
usual
and
when
he
came
out
he
looked
very
much
pleased
i
never
was
more
thankful
in
my
life
he
said
eagerly
as
soon
as
he
was
within
convenient
distance
that
poor
fellow
was
at
death
door
yesterday
and
when
i
saw
his
wife
and
little
children
and
thought
his
life
was
all
that
stood
between
them
and
miserable
destitution
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
save
it
this
morning
he
is
as
bright
as
a
dollar
but
i
have
been
dreading
to
go
into
that
house
ever
since
i
left
it
yesterday
noon
they
did
in
the
least
know
how
narrow
a
chance
he
had
and
it
the
first
time
i
have
been
chief
mourner
poor
souls
they
do
dread
their
troubles
half
so
much
as
i
do
he
will
have
a
good
little
farm
here
in
another
year
or
two
it
only
needs
draining
to
be
excellent
land
and
he
knows
that
the
doctor
turned
and
looked
back
over
the
few
acres
with
great
pleasure
now
we
go
and
see
about
old
willet
though
i
do
believe
there
any
great
need
of
it
she
belongs
to
one
of
two
very
bad
classes
of
patients
it
makes
me
so
angry
to
hear
her
cough
twice
as
much
as
need
be
in
your
practice
he
continued
soberly
you
must
remember
that
there
is
danger
of
giving
too
strong
doses
to
such
a
sufferer
and
too
light
ones
to
the
friends
who
insist
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
them
i
give
much
for
a
doctor
who
ca
see
for
himself
in
most
cases
but
not
always
not
always
the
doctor
was
in
such
a
hospitable
frame
of
mind
that
nobody
could
have
helped
telling
him
anything
and
happily
he
made
an
excellent
introduction
for
nan
secret
by
inquiring
how
she
had
got
on
with
her
studies
but
she
directed
his
attention
to
the
wet
plants
in
the
bottom
of
the
carriage
which
were
complimented
before
she
said
a
minute
afterward
oh
i
wonder
if
i
shall
make
a
mistake
i
was
afraid
you
would
laugh
at
me
and
think
it
was
all
nonsense
dear
me
no
replied
the
doctor
you
will
be
the
successor
of
martin
dyer
and
the
admiration
of
the
neighborhood
but
changing
his
tone
quickly
he
said
i
am
going
to
teach
you
all
i
can
just
as
long
as
you
have
any
wish
to
learn
it
has
not
done
you
a
bit
of
harm
to
know
something
about
medicine
and
i
believe
in
your
studying
it
more
than
you
do
yourself
i
have
always
thought
about
it
but
you
are
very
young
there
plenty
of
time
and
i
do
mean
to
be
hurried
you
must
remember
that
though
i
see
your
fitness
and
peculiar
adaptability
a
great
deal
better
than
you
can
these
twenty
years
yet
you
will
be
growing
happier
these
next
few
years
at
any
rate
however
impossible
life
has
seemed
to
you
lately
i
suppose
there
will
be
a
great
many
obstacles
reflected
nan
with
an
absence
of
her
usual
spirit
obstacles
yes
answered
leslie
vigorously
of
course
there
will
be
it
is
climbing
a
long
hill
to
try
to
study
medicine
or
to
study
anything
else
and
if
you
are
going
to
fear
obstacles
you
will
have
a
poor
chance
at
success
there
are
just
as
many
reasons
as
you
will
stop
to
count
up
why
you
should
not
do
your
plain
duty
but
if
you
are
going
to
make
anything
of
yourself
you
must
go
straight
ahead
taking
it
for
granted
that
there
will
be
opposition
enough
but
doing
what
is
right
all
the
same
i
suppose
i
have
repeated
to
you
fifty
times
what
old
friend
meadows
told
me
years
ago
he
was
a
great
success
at
and
once
i
asked
him
to
give
me
some
advice
about
a
piece
of
property
leslie
says
he
own
opinion
is
the
best
for
thee
if
thee
asks
ten
people
what
to
do
they
will
tell
thee
ten
things
and
then
thee
does
know
as
much
as
when
thee
set
out
and
leslie
growing
very
much
in
earnest
reached
forward
for
the
whip
i
want
you
to
be
a
good
woman
and
i
want
you
to
be
all
the
use
you
can
he
said
it
seems
to
me
like
stealing
for
men
and
women
to
live
in
the
world
and
do
nothing
to
make
it
better
you
have
thought
a
great
deal
about
this
and
so
have
i
and
now
we
will
do
the
best
we
can
at
making
a
good
doctor
of
you
i
care
whether
people
think
it
is
a
proper
vocation
for
women
or
not
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
more
than
proper
for
you
and
god
has
given
you
a
fitness
for
it
which
it
is
a
shame
to
waste
and
if
you
ever
hesitate
and
regret
what
you
have
said
you
wo
have
done
yourself
any
harm
by
learning
how
to
take
care
of
your
own
health
and
other
people
but
i
shall
never
regret
it
said
nan
stoutly
i
do
believe
i
should
ever
be
fit
for
anything
else
and
you
know
as
well
as
i
that
i
must
have
something
to
do
i
used
to
wish
over
and
over
again
that
i
was
a
boy
when
i
was
a
little
thing
down
at
the
farm
and
the
only
reason
i
had
in
the
world
was
that
i
could
be
a
doctor
like
you
better
than
that
i
hope
said
leslie
but
you
must
think
it
will
be
a
short
piece
of
work
it
will
take
more
patience
than
you
are
ready
to
give
just
now
and
we
will
go
on
quietly
and
let
it
grow
by
the
way
like
your
here
if
you
do
drive
a
little
faster
sister
willet
may
be
gathered
before
we
get
to
her
and
this
being
a
somewhat
unwise
and
hysterical
patient
whose
recovery
was
not
in
the
least
despaired
of
leslie
and
his
young
companion
were
heartlessly
merry
over
her
case
the
doctor
had
been
unprepared
for
such
an
episode
outwardly
life
had
seemed
to
flow
so
easily
from
one
set
of
circumstances
to
the
next
and
the
changes
had
been
so
gradual
and
so
natural
he
had
looked
forward
with
such
certainty
to
nan
future
that
it
seemed
strange
that
the
formal
acceptance
of
such
an
inevitable
idea
as
her
studying
medicine
should
have
troubled
her
so
much
separated
as
he
was
from
the
groups
of
men
and
women
who
are
responsible
for
what
we
call
the
opinion
of
society
and
independent
himself
of
any
fettering
conventionalities
he
had
grown
careless
of
what
anybody
might
say
he
only
hoped
since
his
ward
had
found
her
proper
work
that
she
would
hold
to
it
and
of
this
he
had
little
doubt
the
girl
herself
quickly
lost
sight
of
the
fancied
difficulty
of
making
the
great
decision
and
as
is
usually
the
case
saw
all
the
first
objections
and
hindrances
fade
away
into
a
dim
distance
and
grow
less
and
less
noticeable
and
more
than
that
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
had
taken
every
step
of
her
life
straight
toward
this
choice
of
a
profession
so
many
things
she
had
never
understood
before
now
became
perfectly
clear
and
evident
proofs
that
outside
her
own
preferences
and
choices
a
wise
purpose
had
been
at
work
with
her
and
for
her
so
it
all
appeared
more
natural
every
day
and
while
she
knew
that
the
excitement
and
formality
of
the
first
very
uncomfortable
day
or
two
had
proved
her
freedom
of
choice
it
seemed
the
more
impossible
that
she
should
have
shirked
this
great
commission
and
trust
for
which
nature
had
fitted
her
xiii
a
straight
course
the
next
year
or
two
was
spent
in
quiet
life
at
home
it
was
made
evident
that
beside
her
inclination
and
natural
fitness
for
her
chosen
work
our
student
was
also
developing
the
other
most
important
requisite
a
capacity
for
hard
study
and
patient
continuance
there
had
been
as
little
said
as
possible
about
the
plan
but
it
was
not
long
before
the
propriety
of
it
became
a
favorite
subject
of
discussion
it
is
quite
unnecessary
perhaps
to
state
that
everybody
had
his
or
her
own
opinion
of
the
wisdom
of
such
a
course
and
both
leslie
and
his
ward
suffered
much
reproach
and
questioning
as
the
comments
ranged
from
indignation
to
amusement
but
it
was
as
true
of
nan
calling
as
of
all
others
that
it
would
be
her
own
failure
to
make
it
respected
from
which
any
just
contempt
might
come
and
she
had
thrown
herself
into
her
chosen
career
with
such
zeal
and
pride
and
affectionate
desire
to
please
her
teacher
that
the
small
public
who
had
at
first
jeered
or
condemned
her
came
at
last
to
accepting
the
thing
as
inevitable
and
a
matter
of
course
even
if
they
did
not
actually
approve
there
was
such
a
vigorous
determination
in
the
minds
of
the
doctor
and
his
pupil
that
nan
should
not
only
be
a
doctor
but
a
good
one
that
anything
less
than
a
decided
fitness
for
the
profession
would
have
doomed
them
both
to
disappointment
even
with
such
unwearied
effort
and
painstaking
in
the
earlier
years
of
his
practice
leslie
had
been
much
sought
as
an
instructor
but
he
had
long
since
begun
to
deny
the
young
men
who
had
wished
to
be
his
students
though
hardly
one
had
ever
gone
from
the
neighborhood
of
oldfields
who
did
not
owe
much
to
him
for
his
wise
suggestions
and
practical
help
he
patiently
taught
this
eager
young
scholar
day
by
day
and
gave
her
as
fast
as
he
could
the
benefit
of
the
wisdom
which
he
had
gained
through
faithful
devotion
to
his
business
and
the
persistent
study
of
many
years
nan
followed
step
by
step
and
while
becoming
more
conscious
of
her
own
ignorance
and
of
the
uncertainties
and
the
laws
of
the
practice
of
medicine
with
every
week
study
knew
better
and
better
that
it
is
resource
and
bravery
and
being
able
to
think
for
one
self
that
make
a
physician
worth
anything
there
must
be
an
instinct
that
recognizes
a
disease
and
suggests
its
remedy
as
much
as
an
instinct
that
finds
the
right
notes
and
harmonies
for
a
composer
of
music
or
the
colors
for
a
true
artist
picture
or
the
results
of
figures
for
a
mathematician
men
and
women
may
learn
these
callings
from
others
may
practice
all
the
combinations
until
they
can
carry
them
through
with
a
greater
or
less
degree
of
unconsciousness
of
brain
and
fingers
but
there
is
something
needed
beside
even
drill
and
experience
every
student
of
medicine
should
be
fitted
by
nature
with
a
power
of
insight
a
gift
for
his
business
for
knowing
what
is
the
right
thing
to
do
and
the
right
time
and
way
to
do
it
must
have
this
power
in
his
own
nature
of
using
and
discovering
the
resources
of
medicine
without
constant
reliance
upon
the
books
or
the
fashion
some
men
use
their
ability
for
their
own
good
and
renown
and
some
think
first
of
the
good
of
others
and
as
the
great
poet
tells
the
truths
of
god
and
makes
other
souls
wiser
and
stronger
and
fitter
for
action
so
the
great
doctor
works
for
the
body
health
and
tries
to
keep
human
beings
free
from
the
failures
that
come
from
neglect
and
ignorance
and
ready
to
be
the
soul
instrument
of
action
and
service
in
this
world
it
is
not
to
keep
us
from
death
it
is
no
superstitious
avoidance
of
the
next
life
that
should
call
loudest
for
the
physician
skill
but
the
necessity
of
teaching
and
remedying
the
inferior
bodies
which
have
come
to
us
through
either
our
foolishness
or
our
own
so
few
people
know
even
what
true
and
complete
physical
life
is
much
less
anything
of
the
spiritual
existence
that
is
already
possible
and
so
few
listen
to
what
the
best
doctors
are
trying
their
best
to
teach
while
people
think
it
no
wrong
to
bring
into
the
world
human
beings
with
even
less
vitality
than
themselves
and
take
no
pains
to
keep
the
simplest
laws
of
health
or
to
teach
their
children
to
do
so
just
so
long
there
will
be
plenty
of
sorrow
of
an
avoidable
kind
and
thousands
of
shipwrecked
and
failing
and
inadequate
and
useless
lives
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
word
how
can
those
who
preach
to
the
soul
hope
to
be
heard
by
those
who
do
not
even
make
the
best
of
their
bodies
but
alas
the
convenience
and
easiness
or
pleasure
of
the
present
moment
is
allowed
to
become
the
cause
of
an
endless
series
of
terrible
effects
which
go
down
into
the
distance
of
the
future
multiplying
themselves
a
thousandfold
the
doctor
told
nan
many
curious
things
as
they
drove
about
together
certain
traits
of
certain
families
and
how
the
dyers
were
of
strong
constitution
and
lived
to
a
great
age
in
spite
of
severe
illnesses
and
accidents
and
all
manner
of
unfavorable
conditions
while
the
dunnells
who
looked
a
great
deal
stronger
were
sensitive
and
deficient
in
vitality
so
that
an
apparently
slight
attack
of
disease
quickly
proved
fatal
and
so
nan
knew
that
one
thing
to
be
considered
was
the
family
and
another
the
individual
variation
and
she
began
to
recognize
the
people
who
might
be
treated
fearlessly
because
they
were
safe
to
form
a
league
with
against
any
ailment
being
responsive
to
medicines
and
straightforward
in
their
departure
from
or
return
to
a
state
of
health
others
being
treacherous
and
hard
to
control
full
of
surprises
and
baffling
a
doctor
with
their
feints
and
follies
of
symptoms
while
all
the
time
death
himself
was
making
ready
for
a
last
fatal
siege
these
all
being
the
representatives
of
types
which
might
be
found
everywhere
often
leslie
would
be
found
eagerly
praising
some
useful
drugs
which
had
been
foolishly
neglected
by
those
who
liked
to
experiment
with
newer
remedies
and
be
up
with
the
times
as
they
called
their
not
very
intelligent
dependence
upon
the
treatment
in
vogue
at
the
moment
among
the
younger
men
of
certain
cliques
to
some
of
whom
the
brilliant
operation
was
more
important
than
its
damaging
result
there
was
even
in
those
days
a
haphazard
way
of
doctoring
in
which
the
health
of
the
patient
was
secondary
to
the
promotion
of
new
theories
and
the
young
scholar
who
could
write
a
puzzlingly
technical
paper
too
often
outranked
the
old
practitioner
who
conquered
some
malignant
disorder
where
even
the
malpractice
of
the
patient
and
his
friends
had
stood
like
a
lion
in
the
way
but
leslie
was
always
trying
to
get
at
the
truth
and
nobody
recognized
more
clearly
the
service
which
the
reverent
and
truly
progressive
younger
men
were
rendering
to
the
profession
he
added
many
new
publications
to
his
subscription
list
and
gleaned
here
and
there
those
notes
which
he
knew
would
be
helpful
and
which
were
suited
to
the
degree
of
knowledge
which
his
apprentice
had
already
gained
it
is
needless
to
say
what
pleasure
it
gave
him
and
what
evening
talks
they
had
together
what
histories
of
former
victories
and
defeats
and
curious
discoveries
were
combined
like
a
bit
of
with
nan
diligent
devotion
to
her
course
of
study
and
presently
the
girl
would
take
a
step
or
two
alone
and
even
make
a
visit
by
herself
to
see
if
anything
chanced
to
be
needed
when
a
case
was
progressing
favorably
and
with
the
excuse
of
the
business
or
and
the
physicians
of
the
neighboring
towns
who
came
together
occasionally
for
each
other
assistance
most
of
whom
had
known
nan
from
her
childhood
though
at
first
they
had
shrunk
from
speaking
of
many
details
of
their
professional
work
in
her
hearing
and
covered
their
meaning
like
the
ostriches
heads
in
the
sand
of
a
latin
cognomen
were
soon
set
at
their
ease
by
unconsciousness
of
either
shamefacedness
or
disgust
and
one
by
one
grew
interested
in
her
career
and
hopeful
of
her
success
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
importance
of
such
experiences
as
these
in
forming
the
character
of
the
young
girl
power
of
resource
and
wealth
of
and
practical
experience
sometimes
in
houses
where
she
would
have
felt
at
least
liberty
to
go
only
as
spectator
and
scholar
of
medicine
leslie
insisted
upon
establishing
her
for
a
few
days
as
chief
nurse
and
overseer
and
before
nan
had
been
at
work
many
months
her
teacher
found
her
of
great
use
and
grew
more
proud
and
glad
day
by
day
as
he
watched
her
determination
her
enthusiasm
and
her
excellent
progress
over
and
over
again
he
said
to
himself
or
to
her
that
she
was
doing
the
work
for
which
nature
had
meant
her
and
when
the
time
came
for
her
to
go
away
from
oldfields
it
seemed
more
impossible
than
it
ever
had
before
that
he
should
get
on
without
her
at
home
or
as
an
independent
human
being
who
was
following
reverently
in
the
path
he
had
chosen
so
many
years
before
for
her
sake
he
had
reached
out
again
toward
many
acquaintances
from
whom
he
had
drifted
away
and
he
made
many
short
journeys
to
boston
or
to
new
york
and
was
pleased
at
his
hearty
welcome
back
to
the
medical
meetings
he
had
hardly
entered
during
so
many
years
he
missed
not
a
few
old
friends
but
he
quickly
made
new
ones
he
was
vastly
pleased
when
the
younger
men
seemed
glad
to
hear
him
speak
and
it
was
often
proved
that
either
through
study
or
experience
he
had
caught
at
some
fresh
knowledge
of
which
his
associates
were
still
ignorant
he
had
laughingly
accused
himself
of
being
a
rusty
country
doctor
and
old
fogy
who
had
not
kept
up
with
the
times
but
many
a
letter
followed
him
home
with
thanks
for
some
helpful
suggestion
or
advice
as
to
the
management
of
a
troublesome
case
he
was
too
far
away
to
give
room
for
any
danger
of
professional
jealousy
or
for
the
infringement
of
that
ever
lengthening
code
of
etiquette
so
important
to
the
sensitive
medical
mind
therefore
he
had
only
much
pleasure
and
a
fine
tribute
of
recognition
and
honor
and
he
smiled
more
than
once
as
he
sat
in
the
quiet
oldfields
study
before
the
fire
and
looked
up
at
captain
finch
little
ship
and
told
nan
of
his
town
experiences
not
always
omitting
though
attempting
to
deprecate
the
compliments
in
some
when
they
were
on
peculiarly
good
terms
with
each
other
and
nan
believed
there
could
be
no
better
doctor
in
the
world
and
stoutly
told
him
so
and
yet
listened
only
when
he
said
that
he
had
a
great
mind
to
go
to
town
and
open
an
office
and
make
a
specialty
of
treating
diseases
of
the
heart
since
everybody
had
a
specialty
nowadays
he
never
felt
so
ready
for
practice
as
now
but
nan
somehow
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
his
being
anywhere
but
in
his
home
for
herself
she
would
have
been
ready
to
venture
anything
if
it
would
further
her
purpose
but
that
leslie
should
begin
a
new
career
or
contest
with
the
world
seemed
impossible
he
was
not
so
strong
as
he
used
to
be
and
he
was
already
famous
among
his
fellows
she
would
help
him
with
his
work
by
and
by
even
more
than
now
and
her
own
chosen
calling
of
a
country
doctor
was
the
dearer
to
her
because
he
had
followed
it
so
gallantly
before
her
loving
and
admiring
eyes
but
leslie
built
many
a
castle
in
the
air
with
himself
and
a
great
city
practice
for
tenants
and
said
that
it
would
be
a
capital
thing
for
nan
she
could
go
on
with
it
alone
by
and
by
it
was
astonishing
how
little
some
of
the
city
doctors
knew
they
relied
upon
each
other
too
much
they
should
all
be
forced
to
drive
over
hill
and
dale
and
be
knocked
about
in
a
hard
country
practice
for
eight
or
ten
years
before
they
went
to
town
plenty
of
time
to
read
their
books
in
june
and
january
the
doctor
would
grumble
to
himself
and
turn
to
look
fondly
at
the
long
rows
of
his
dear
library
acquaintances
his
braithwaites
and
lancets
and
their
younger
brothers
beside
the
first
new
sydenham
society
books
with
their
clumsy
blot
of
gilding
and
he
would
stand
sometimes
with
his
hands
behind
him
and
look
at
the
many
familiar
rows
of
brown
volumes
most
of
them
delightfully
worn
with
his
own
use
and
that
of
the
other
physicians
whose
generous
friend
and
constant
instructor
he
had
been
through
years
of
sometimes
stormy
but
usually
friendly
intercourse
and
association
when
people
in
general
had
grown
tired
of
discussing
this
strange
freak
and
purpose
of
the
doctor
and
his
ward
and
had
become
familiar
with
nan
persistent
interest
and
occupation
in
her
studies
there
came
a
time
of
great
discontent
to
the
two
persons
most
concerned
for
it
was
impossible
to
disguise
the
fact
that
the
time
had
again
come
for
the
girl
to
go
away
from
home
they
had
always
looked
forward
to
this
and
directed
much
thought
and
action
toward
it
and
yet
they
decided
with
great
regret
upon
setting
a
new
train
of
things
in
motion
while
it
was
well
enough
and
useful
enough
that
nan
should
go
on
with
her
present
mode
of
life
they
both
had
a
wider
outlook
and
though
with
the
excuse
of
her
youthfulness
they
had
put
off
her
departure
as
long
as
possible
still
almost
without
any
discussion
it
was
decided
that
she
must
enter
the
medical
school
to
go
through
with
its
course
of
instruction
formally
and
receive
its
authority
to
practice
her
profession
they
both
felt
that
this
held
a
great
many
unpleasantnesses
among
its
store
of
benefits
nan
was
no
longer
to
be
shielded
and
protected
and
guided
by
some
one
whose
wisdom
she
rarely
questioned
but
must
make
her
own
decisions
instead
and
give
from
her
own
bounty
and
stand
in
her
lot
and
place
her
later
were
sure
to
be
more
trying
than
her
earlier
ones
as
they
carried
her
into
deeper
waters
of
scholarship
and
were
more
important
to
her
future
position
before
the
public
if
a
young
man
plans
the
same
course
everything
conspires
to
help
him
and
forward
him
and
the
very
fact
of
his
having
chosen
one
of
the
learned
professions
gives
him
a
certain
social
preëminence
and
dignity
but
in
the
days
of
nan
student
life
it
was
just
the
reverse
though
she
had
been
directed
toward
such
a
purpose
entirely
by
her
singular
talent
instead
of
by
the
motives
of
expediency
which
rule
the
decisions
of
a
large
proportion
of
the
young
men
who
study
medicine
she
found
little
encouragement
either
from
the
quality
of
the
school
or
the
interest
of
society
in
general
there
were
times
when
she
actually
resented
the
prospect
of
the
many
weeks
which
she
must
spend
in
listening
to
inferior
instruction
before
gaining
a
diploma
which
was
only
a
formal
seal
of
disapproval
in
most
eyes
and
yet
when
she
remembered
her
perfect
certainty
that
she
was
doing
the
right
thing
and
remembered
what
renown
some
women
physicians
had
won
and
the
avenues
of
usefulness
which
lay
open
to
her
on
every
side
there
was
no
real
drawing
back
but
rather
a
proud
certainty
of
her
most
womanly
and
respectable
calling
and
a
reverent
desire
to
make
the
best
use
possible
of
the
gifts
god
had
certainly
not
made
a
mistake
in
giving
her
if
he
meant
i
should
be
a
doctor
the
girl
told
herself
the
best
thing
i
can
do
is
to
try
to
be
a
good
one
so
nan
packed
her
boxes
and
said
to
graham
who
looked
wistful
and
doubtful
but
blessed
her
most
heartily
saying
she
should
miss
her
sadly
in
the
winter
and
marilla
who
had
unexpectedly
reserved
her
opinion
of
late
made
believe
that
she
was
very
busy
in
the
pantry
just
as
she
had
done
when
nan
was
being
launched
for
she
shook
her
own
floury
hands
vigorously
and
offered
one
at
last
muffled
in
her
apron
and
wished
our
friend
good
luck
with
considerable
friendliness
mentioning
that
she
should
be
glad
if
nan
would
say
when
she
wrote
home
what
shapes
they
seemed
to
be
wearing
for
bonnets
in
the
city
though
she
supposed
they
would
be
flaunting
for
oldfields
anyway
the
doctor
was
going
too
and
they
started
for
the
station
much
too
early
for
the
train
since
leslie
always
suffered
from
a
nervous
dread
of
having
an
unavoidable
summons
to
a
distant
patient
at
the
last
moment
and
when
the
examinations
were
over
and
nan
had
been
matriculated
and
the
doctor
had
somewhat
contemptuously
overlooked
the
building
and
its
capabilities
and
had
compared
those
students
whom
he
saw
with
his
remembrance
of
his
own
class
and
triumphantly
picked
out
a
face
and
figure
that
looked
hopeful
here
and
there
he
told
himself
that
like
all
new
growths
it
was
feeble
yet
and
needed
girls
like
his
nan
with
high
moral
purpose
and
excellent
capacity
who
would
make
the
college
strong
and
to
be
respected
not
such
doctors
as
several
of
whom
he
reminded
himself
who
were
disgracing
their
sex
but
those
whose
lives
were
ruled
by
a
pettiness
of
detail
a
lack
of
power
and
an
absence
of
high
aim
somehow
both
our
friends
lost
much
of
the
feeling
that
nan
was
doing
a
peculiar
thing
when
they
saw
so
many
others
following
the
same
path
and
having
seen
nan
more
than
in
her
winter
quarters
and
knowing
that
one
or
two
of
her
former
school
friends
had
given
her
a
delighted
and
most
friendly
welcome
and
having
made
a
few
visits
to
the
people
whom
he
fancied
would
help
her
in
one
way
or
another
leslie
said
and
turned
his
face
homeward
feeling
more
lonely
than
he
had
felt
in
a
great
many
years
before
he
thought
about
nan
a
great
deal
on
the
journey
though
he
had
provided
himself
with
some
most
desirable
new
books
he
was
thankful
he
had
been
able
to
do
a
kind
turn
for
one
of
the
most
influential
doctors
who
had
cheerfully
promised
to
put
some
special
advantages
in
nan
way
but
when
he
reached
home
the
house
seemed
very
empty
and
he
missed
his
gay
companion
as
he
drove
along
the
country
roads
after
the
days
began
to
grow
longer
and
the
sun
brighter
such
pleasant
letters
came
from
the
absent
scholar
that
the
doctor
took
heart
more
and
more
and
went
over
to
graham
with
almost
every
fresh
bit
of
news
she
smiled
and
listened
and
applauded
and
one
day
said
with
delightful
cordiality
that
she
wished
there
were
more
girls
who
cared
whether
their
lives
really
amounted
to
anything
but
not
every
one
had
a
talent
which
was
such
a
stimulus
as
nan
nothing
succeeds
like
success
rejoined
the
doctor
cheerfully
i
always
knew
the
child
would
do
the
best
she
could
xiv
miss
prince
of
dunport
while
all
these
years
were
passing
miss
anna
prince
the
elder
was
living
quietly
in
dunport
and
she
had
changed
so
little
that
her
friends
frequently
complimented
her
upon
such
continued
youthfulness
she
had
by
no
means
forgotten
the
two
greatest
among
the
many
losses
and
sorrows
of
her
life
but
the
first
sharp
pain
of
them
was
long
since
over
with
the
lover
from
whom
she
had
parted
for
the
sake
of
a
petty
misunderstanding
had
married
afterward
and
died
early
but
he
had
left
a
son
of
whom
miss
prince
was
very
proud
and
fond
and
she
had
given
him
the
place
in
her
heart
which
should
have
belonged
to
her
own
niece
when
she
thought
of
the
other
trial
she
believed
herself
still
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
and
gave
herself
frequent
assurances
that
it
had
been
impossible
to
act
otherwise
at
the
time
of
her
brother
death
and
his
wife
strange
behavior
afterward
and
she
had
persuaded
her
conscience
to
be
quiet
until
at
last
with
the
ideal
of
a
suspicious
uncongenial
disagreeable
group
of
rustics
in
her
mind
she
thought
it
was
well
ordered
by
heaven
that
she
had
been
spared
any
closer
intercourse
miss
prince
was
a
proud
and
stately
woman
of
the
old
new
england
type
more
colonial
than
american
perhaps
and
quite
provincial
in
her
traditions
and
prejudices
she
was
highly
respected
in
her
native
town
where
she
was
a
prominent
figure
in
society
nobody
was
more
generous
and
kind
or
public
spirited
as
her
friends
often
said
and
young
george
gerry
was
though
he
gave
her
great
pleasure
by
his
evident
affection
and
interest
he
liked
to
pay
frequent
visits
to
his
old
friend
and
to
talk
with
her
she
had
been
a
very
attractive
girl
long
ago
and
the
best
of
her
charms
had
not
faded
yet
the
young
man
was
always
welcomed
warmly
and
had
more
than
once
been
helped
in
his
projects
his
mother
was
a
feeble
woman
who
took
little
interest
in
anything
outside
her
own
doors
and
he
liked
himself
better
as
he
sat
in
miss
prince
parlor
than
anywhere
else
we
are
always
fond
of
the
society
of
our
best
selves
and
though
he
was
popular
with
the
rest
of
his
townspeople
he
somehow
could
not
help
trying
always
to
be
especially
agreeable
to
miss
prince
although
she
was
apparently
free
from
regrets
and
very
well
satisfied
with
life
even
her
best
friends
did
not
know
how
lonely
her
life
had
seemed
to
her
or
how
sadly
hurt
she
had
been
by
the
shame
and
sorrow
of
her
only
brother
marriage
the
thought
of
his
child
and
of
the
impossibility
of
taking
her
to
her
heart
and
home
had
been
like
a
nightmare
at
first
and
yet
miss
prince
lacked
courage
to
break
down
the
barriers
and
to
at
least
know
the
worst
she
kept
the
two
ideas
of
the
actual
niece
and
the
ideal
one
whom
she
might
have
loved
so
much
distinct
and
separate
in
her
mind
and
was
divided
between
a
longing
to
see
the
girl
and
a
fierce
dread
of
her
sudden
appearance
she
had
forbidden
any
allusion
to
the
subject
years
and
years
before
and
so
had
prevented
herself
from
hearing
good
news
as
well
as
bad
though
she
had
always
been
careful
that
the
small
yearly
remittance
should
be
promptly
sent
and
was
impatient
to
receive
the
formal
acknowledgment
of
it
which
she
instantly
took
pains
to
destroy
she
sometimes
in
these
days
thought
about
making
her
will
there
was
no
hurry
about
it
but
it
would
be
only
fair
to
provide
for
her
nearest
of
kin
while
she
was
always
certain
that
she
should
not
let
all
her
money
and
the
old
house
with
its
handsome
furnishings
go
into
such
unworthy
hands
it
was
a
very
hard
question
to
settle
and
she
thought
of
it
as
little
as
possible
and
was
sure
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
her
living
a
great
many
years
yet
she
loved
her
old
home
dearly
and
was
even
proud
of
it
and
had
always
taken
great
care
of
the
details
of
its
government
she
never
had
been
foolish
enough
to
make
away
with
her
handsome
mahogany
furniture
and
to
replace
it
with
cheaper
and
less
comfortable
chairs
and
tables
as
many
of
her
neighbors
had
done
and
had
taken
an
obstinate
satisfaction
all
through
the
years
when
it
seemed
quite
out
of
date
in
insisting
upon
the
polishing
of
the
fine
wood
and
the
many
brass
handles
and
of
late
she
had
been
reaping
a
reward
for
her
constancy
it
had
been
a
marvel
to
certain
progressive
people
that
a
person
of
her
comfortable
estate
should
be
willing
to
reflect
that
there
was
not
a
table
in
her
house
until
it
slowly
dawned
upon
them
at
last
that
she
was
mistress
of
the
finest
house
in
town
outwardly
it
was
painted
white
and
stood
close
upon
the
street
with
a
few
steep
front
steps
coming
abruptly
down
into
the
middle
of
the
narrow
sidewalk
its
interior
was
spacious
and
very
imposing
not
only
for
the
time
it
was
built
in
the
last
century
but
for
any
other
time
miss
prince
ancestors
had
belonged
to
some
of
the
most
distinguished
among
the
colonial
families
which
fact
she
neither
appeared
to
remember
nor
consented
to
forget
and
as
often
happened
in
the
seaport
towns
of
new
england
there
had
been
one
or
two
men
in
every
generation
who
had
followed
the
sea
her
own
father
had
been
among
the
number
and
the
closets
of
the
old
house
were
well
provided
with
rare
china
and
fine
old
english
crockery
that
would
drive
an
enthusiastic
collector
to
distraction
the
carved
woodwork
of
the
railings
and
wainscotings
and
cornices
had
been
devised
by
ingenious
and
patient
craftsmen
and
the
same
portraits
and
old
engravings
hung
upon
the
walls
that
had
been
there
when
its
mistress
could
first
remember
she
had
always
been
so
well
suited
with
her
home
that
she
had
never
desired
to
change
it
in
any
particular
her
maids
were
well
drilled
to
their
duties
and
priscilla
who
was
chief
of
the
staff
had
been
in
that
dignified
position
for
many
years
if
miss
prince
grandmother
could
return
to
dunport
from
another
world
she
would
hardly
believe
that
she
had
left
her
earthly
home
for
a
day
it
presented
so
nearly
the
same
appearance
but
however
conscientiously
the
effort
had
been
made
to
keep
up
the
old
reputation
for
hospitality
it
had
somehow
been
a
failure
and
miss
prince
had
given
fewer
entertainments
every
year
long
ago
while
she
was
still
a
young
woman
she
had
begun
to
wear
a
certain
quaint
and
elderly
manner
which
might
have
come
from
association
with
such
antiquated
household
gods
and
a
desire
to
match
well
with
her
beloved
surroundings
a
great
many
of
her
early
friends
had
died
and
she
was
not
the
sort
of
person
who
can
easily
form
new
ties
of
intimate
friendship
she
was
very
loyal
to
those
who
were
still
left
and
as
has
been
said
her
interest
in
george
gerry
who
was
his
namesake
and
likeness
was
a
very
great
pleasure
to
her
some
persons
liked
to
whisper
together
now
and
then
about
the
mysterious
niece
who
was
never
mentioned
otherwise
but
though
curiosity
had
led
to
a
partial
knowledge
of
our
heroine
not
unfavorable
aspect
and
circumstances
nobody
ever
dared
to
give
such
information
to
the
person
who
should
have
been
most
interested
this
was
one
of
the
standard
long
stories
of
dunport
with
which
old
residents
liked
to
regale
newcomers
and
handsome
jack
prince
was
the
hero
of
a
most
edifying
romance
being
represented
as
a
victim
of
the
prince
pride
as
his
sister
had
been
before
him
his
life
had
been
ruined
and
he
had
begged
his
wretched
wife
at
the
last
to
bring
him
home
to
dunport
alive
or
dead
the
woman
had
treated
miss
prince
with
shameful
impudence
and
had
disappeared
afterward
the
child
had
been
brought
up
with
her
own
people
and
it
was
understood
that
miss
prince
efforts
to
have
any
connection
with
them
were
all
thwarted
lately
it
had
become
known
that
the
girl
guardian
was
a
very
fine
man
and
was
taking
a
great
interest
in
her
but
the
reader
will
imagine
how
this
story
grew
and
changed
in
different
people
minds
some
persons
insisted
that
miss
prince
had
declined
to
see
her
brother
child
and
others
that
it
was
denied
her
it
was
often
said
in
these
days
that
nan
must
be
free
to
do
as
she
chose
but
it
was
more
than
likely
that
she
had
assumed
the
prejudices
against
her
aunt
with
which
she
must
have
become
most
familiar
as
for
miss
prince
herself
she
had
long
ago
become
convinced
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
in
this
matter
after
one
has
followed
a
certain
course
for
some
time
everything
seems
to
persuade
one
that
no
other
is
possible
sometimes
she
feared
that
an
excitement
and
danger
lurked
in
her
future
but
after
all
her
days
went
by
so
calmly
and
nearer
things
seemed
so
much
more
important
than
this
vague
sorrow
and
dread
that
she
went
to
and
fro
in
the
dunport
streets
and
was
courteous
and
kind
in
her
own
house
and
read
a
sensible
book
now
and
then
and
spent
her
time
as
benevolently
and
respectably
as
possible
she
was
indeed
an
admirable
member
of
society
who
had
suffered
very
much
in
her
youth
and
those
who
knew
her
well
could
not
be
too
glad
that
her
later
years
were
passing
far
less
unhappily
than
most
people
in
the
days
when
her
niece
had
lately
finished
her
first
winter
at
the
medical
school
miss
prince
had
just
freed
herself
from
the
responsibility
of
some
slight
repairs
which
the
house
had
needed
she
had
been
in
many
ways
much
more
occupied
than
usual
and
had
given
hardly
a
thought
to
more
remote
affairs
at
last
there
had
come
an
evening
when
she
felt
at
leisure
and
happily
miss
fraley
one
of
her
earliest
friends
had
come
to
pay
her
a
visit
the
two
ladies
sat
at
the
front
windows
of
the
west
parlor
looking
out
upon
the
street
while
the
hostess
expressed
her
gratitude
that
the
overturning
of
her
household
affairs
was
at
an
end
and
that
she
was
all
in
order
for
summer
they
talked
about
the
damage
and
discomfort
inflicted
by
masons
and
the
general
havoc
which
follows
a
small
piece
of
fallen
ceiling
miss
prince
having
made
a
final
round
of
inspection
just
after
tea
had
ascertained
that
the
last
of
the
white
dimity
curtains
and
coverings
were
in
their
places
upstairs
in
the
bedrooms
and
her
love
of
order
was
satisfied
she
had
complimented
priscilla
and
made
her
and
the
maids
the
customary
spring
present
and
had
returned
to
her
evening
post
of
observation
at
the
parlor
window
just
as
miss
fraley
came
in
she
was
not
in
the
mood
for
receiving
guests
being
a
trifle
tired
but
eunice
fraley
was
a
mild
little
creature
with
a
gentle
deprecatory
manner
which
had
always
appealed
to
miss
more
chivalrous
nature
besides
she
knew
this
to
be
a
most
true
and
affectionate
friend
who
had
also
the
gift
of
appearing
when
everything
was
ready
for
her
as
the
bluebirds
come
and
the
robins
in
the
early
days
of
spring
i
wish
i
could
say
that
our
house
was
all
in
order
but
one
closet
said
the
guest
in
a
more
melancholy
tone
than
usual
i
believe
we
are
more
than
ever
this
year
you
know
we
have
children
with
us
for
a
fortnight
while
she
goes
away
for
a
rest
and
they
have
been
a
good
deal
of
care
i
think
mother
is
getting
tired
of
them
now
though
she
was
very
eager
to
have
a
visit
from
them
at
first
she
said
this
morning
that
the
little
girl
was
worse
than
a
kitten
in
a
fit
and
she
did
hope
that
susan
would
think
it
best
to
pass
another
week
away
miss
prince
laughed
a
little
and
so
did
miss
fraley
after
a
hesitation
she
seemed
to
be
in
a
somewhat
sentimental
and
introspective
mood
as
she
looked
out
of
the
window
in
the
may
twilight
i
so
often
feel
as
if
i
were
not
accomplishing
anything
she
said
sadly
it
came
over
me
that
here
i
am
really
an
old
woman
and
i
am
just
about
where
i
first
started
doing
the
same
things
over
and
over
and
no
better
than
ever
i
have
the
gift
of
style
anybody
else
might
have
done
my
work
just
as
well
i
am
afraid
i
am
sure
the
world
would
have
got
along
just
as
well
without
me
mother
has
been
so
active
and
has
reached
such
a
great
age
that
perhaps
it
been
much
advantage
to
me
i
have
only
learned
to
depend
upon
her
instead
of
myself
i
begin
to
see
that
i
should
have
amounted
to
a
great
deal
more
if
i
had
had
a
home
of
my
own
i
sometimes
wish
that
i
were
as
free
to
go
and
come
as
you
are
nancy
but
miss
prince
thoughts
were
pleased
to
take
a
severely
practical
turn
i
not
in
the
least
free
she
answered
cheerfully
i
believe
you
need
something
to
strengthen
you
eunice
i
have
seen
you
so
out
of
spirits
for
a
great
while
free
why
i
tied
to
this
house
as
if
i
were
the
knocker
on
the
front
door
and
i
certainly
have
a
great
deal
of
care
i
put
the
utmost
confidence
in
priscilla
but
those
nieces
of
hers
would
be
going
wherever
they
chose
from
garret
to
cellar
before
i
was
ten
miles
away
from
dunport
i
have
let
the
cook
go
away
for
a
week
and
phoebe
and
priscilla
are
alone
phoebe
is
a
good
little
creature
i
only
hope
she
wo
be
married
within
six
months
for
i
do
know
when
i
have
liked
a
young
girl
so
well
priscilla
was
anxious
i
should
take
that
daughter
of
her
brother
and
was
quite
hurt
because
i
refused
i
dare
say
you
were
right
acknowledged
miss
fraley
though
she
could
not
exactly
see
the
obstacles
to
her
friend
freedom
in
such
strong
light
as
was
expected
i
know
that
it
must
be
difficult
for
you
sometimes
resumed
the
hostess
presently
in
a
more
sympathetic
tone
your
mother
naturally
finds
it
hard
to
give
up
the
rule
we
ca
expect
her
to
look
at
life
as
younger
persons
do
i
do
expect
it
said
poor
miss
fraley
appealingly
and
i
am
sure
i
try
to
be
considerate
but
how
would
you
like
it
to
be
treated
as
if
you
were
sixteen
instead
of
nearly
sixty
i
know
it
says
in
the
bible
that
children
should
obey
their
parents
but
there
is
no
such
commandment
that
i
can
see
to
women
who
are
old
enough
to
be
grandmothers
themselves
it
does
make
me
perfectly
miserable
to
have
everything
questioned
and
talked
over
that
i
do
but
i
know
i
ought
not
to
say
such
things
i
suppose
i
shall
lie
awake
half
the
night
grieving
over
it
you
know
i
have
the
greatest
respect
for
judgment
i
sure
i
do
know
what
in
the
world
i
should
do
without
her
you
are
too
yielding
eunice
said
miss
prince
kindly
you
try
to
please
everybody
and
that
your
way
of
pleasing
yourself
but
after
all
i
believe
we
give
everybody
more
satisfaction
when
we
hold
fast
to
our
own
ideas
of
right
and
wrong
there
have
been
a
great
many
friends
who
were
more
than
willing
to
give
me
their
advice
in
all
these
years
that
i
have
been
living
alone
but
i
have
always
made
up
my
mind
and
gone
straight
ahead
i
have
no
doubt
i
should
be
very
impatient
now
of
much
comment
and
talking
over
and
yet
there
are
so
many
times
when
i
would
give
anything
to
see
father
or
mother
for
a
little
while
i
have
suffered
from
living
alone
as
much
as
some
persons
do
but
i
often
feel
very
sad
and
lonely
when
i
sit
here
and
think
about
the
past
dear
me
here
is
phoebe
with
the
lights
and
i
dare
say
it
is
just
as
well
i
am
going
to
ask
you
to
go
up
stairs
and
see
the
fresh
paint
and
how
we
are
at
last
as
father
used
to
say
miss
fraley
rose
at
once
with
an
expression
of
pleasure
and
the
two
friends
made
a
leisurely
tour
of
the
old
house
which
seemed
all
ready
for
a
large
family
and
though
its
owner
apparently
enjoyed
her
freedom
and
dominion
it
all
looked
deserted
and
empty
to
her
guest
they
lingered
together
in
the
wide
lower
hall
and
parted
with
unusual
affection
this
was
by
no
means
the
first
hint
that
had
been
given
of
a
somewhat
fettered
and
disappointing
home
life
though
miss
fraley
would
have
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
any
such
report
being
sent
abroad
send
the
children
round
to
see
me
said
miss
prince
by
way
of
parting
benediction
they
can
play
in
the
garden
an
hour
or
two
and
it
will
be
a
change
for
them
and
for
you
which
invitation
was
gratefully
accepted
though
miss
eunice
smiled
at
the
idea
of
their
needing
a
change
when
they
were
sure
to
be
on
every
wharf
in
town
in
the
course
of
the
day
and
already
knew
more
people
in
dunport
than
she
did
the
next
morning
miss
prince
sense
of
general
seemed
to
have
deserted
her
altogether
she
was
overshadowed
by
a
fear
of
impending
disaster
and
felt
strangely
tired
and
dissatisfied
but
she
did
not
believe
in
moping
and
only
assured
herself
that
she
must
make
the
day
an
easy
one
so
being
strong
against
tides
as
some
old
poet
says
of
the
whale
miss
prince
descended
the
stairs
calmly
and
advised
priscilla
to
put
off
the
special
work
that
had
been
planned
until
still
later
in
the
week
you
had
better
ask
your
sister
to
come
and
spend
the
day
with
you
and
have
a
good
quiet
visit
which
permission
priscilla
received
without
comment
being
a
person
of
few
words
but
she
looked
pleased
and
while
her
mistress
went
down
the
garden
walk
to
breathe
the
fresh
morning
air
she
concocted
a
small
omelet
as
an
unexpected
addition
to
the
breakfast
miss
prince
was
very
fond
of
an
omelet
but
priscilla
in
spite
of
all
her
good
qualities
was
liable
to
occasional
fits
of
offishness
and
depression
and
in
those
seasons
kept
her
employer
in
one
way
or
another
on
short
commons
the
day
began
serenely
it
was
the
morning
for
the
dunport
weekly
paper
which
miss
prince
sat
down
at
once
to
read
making
her
invariable
reproachful
remark
that
there
was
nothing
in
it
after
having
devoted
herself
to
this
duty
for
an
hour
or
more
then
she
mounted
to
the
upper
floor
of
her
house
to
put
away
a
blanket
which
had
been
overlooked
in
the
spring
packing
of
the
chests
which
stood
in
a
solemn
row
in
the
north
corner
of
the
garret
there
were
three
dormer
windows
in
the
front
of
the
and
one
of
these
had
been
a
favorite
in
her
youth
she
had
played
with
her
prim
dutch
dolls
there
in
her
childhood
and
she
could
remember
spending
hour
after
hour
watching
for
her
father
ship
when
the
family
had
begun
to
expect
him
home
at
the
end
of
a
long
voyage
she
remembered
with
a
smile
how
grieved
she
had
been
because
once
he
came
into
port
late
in
the
night
and
surprised
them
all
early
in
the
morning
but
he
had
made
amends
by
taking
her
back
with
him
when
he
hurried
on
board
again
after
a
hasty
greeting
miss
prince
lived
that
morning
over
again
as
she
stood
there
old
and
gray
and
alone
in
the
world
she
could
see
again
the
great
and
ship
and
even
the
wizened
monkey
which
belonged
to
one
of
the
sailors
she
lingered
at
her
father
side
admiringly
and
felt
the
tears
come
into
her
eyes
once
more
when
he
gave
her
a
taste
of
the
fiery
contents
of
his
tumbler
they
were
all
in
his
cabin
old
captain
dunn
and
captain
denny
and
captain
peterbeck
were
sitting
round
the
little
table
also
provided
with
tumblers
as
they
listened
eagerly
to
the
story
of
the
voyage
the
sailors
came
now
and
then
for
orders
nancy
thought
her
handsome
father
with
his
bronzed
cheeks
and
white
forehead
and
curly
hair
was
every
inch
a
king
he
was
her
hero
and
nothing
could
please
her
so
much
to
the
end
of
her
days
as
to
have
somebody
announce
whether
from
actual
knowledge
or
hearsay
that
captain
jack
prince
was
the
best
shipmaster
that
ever
sailed
out
of
dunport
she
always
was
sure
there
were
some
presents
stored
away
for
herself
and
young
jack
her
brother
in
one
of
the
lockers
of
the
little
cabin
poor
jack
how
he
used
to
frighten
her
by
climbing
the
shrouds
and
waving
his
cap
from
almost
inaccessible
heights
poor
jack
and
miss
prince
climbed
the
step
to
look
down
the
harbor
again
as
if
the
ship
were
more
than
thirty
days
out
from
amsterdam
and
might
be
expected
at
any
time
if
the
voyage
had
been
favorable
the
house
was
at
no
great
distance
from
the
water
side
though
the
crowded
buildings
obscured
the
view
from
the
lower
stories
there
was
nothing
coming
in
from
sea
but
a
which
did
not
harmonize
with
these
pleasant
reminiscences
though
as
miss
prince
raised
the
window
a
fine
salt
breeze
entered
well
warmed
with
the
may
sunshine
it
had
the
flavor
of
tar
and
the
spirit
of
the
high
seas
and
for
a
wonder
there
could
be
heard
the
knocking
of
shipwrights
hammers
which
in
old
times
were
never
silent
in
the
town
as
she
sat
there
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
window
seat
there
came
to
her
other
recollections
of
her
later
girlhood
when
she
had
stolen
to
this
corner
for
the
sake
of
being
alone
with
her
pleasant
thoughts
though
she
had
cried
there
many
an
hour
after
jack
behavior
had
given
them
the
sorrow
they
hardly
would
own
to
each
other
she
remembered
hearing
her
father
angry
voice
down
stairs
no
she
would
not
think
of
that
again
why
should
she
and
she
shut
the
window
and
went
back
to
be
sure
that
she
had
locked
the
camphor
chest
and
hung
its
key
on
the
rusty
nail
overhead
miss
prince
heard
some
one
open
and
shut
the
front
door
as
she
went
down
and
in
the
small
front
room
she
found
captain
walter
parish
who
held
a
high
place
among
her
most
intimate
friends
he
was
her
cousin
and
had
become
her
general
adviser
and
counselor
he
sometimes
called
himself
laughingly
the
ship
husband
for
it
was
he
who
transacted
most
of
miss
important
business
and
selected
her
paint
and
shingles
and
her
garden
seeds
beside
and
made
and
mended
her
pens
he
liked
to
be
useful
and
agreeable
but
he
had
not
that
satisfaction
in
his
own
home
for
his
wife
had
been
a
most
efficient
person
to
begin
with
and
during
his
absences
at
sea
in
early
life
had
grown
entirely
the
captain
joked
about
it
merrily
but
he
nevertheless
liked
to
feel
that
he
was
still
important
and
miss
prince
generously
told
him
from
time
to
time
that
she
did
not
know
how
she
should
get
on
without
him
and
considerately
kept
up
the
fiction
of
not
wishing
to
take
up
his
time
when
he
must
be
busy
with
his
own
affairs
how
are
you
this
fine
morning
cousin
nancy
said
the
captain
gallantly
i
called
to
say
that
jerry
martin
will
be
here
without
fail
it
seems
he
thought
you
would
send
him
word
when
you
wanted
him
next
and
he
has
been
working
for
himself
i
do
think
the
garden
will
suffer
we
have
had
so
much
cold
weather
and
here
is
a
letter
i
took
from
the
office
he
handed
it
to
miss
prince
with
a
questioning
look
he
knew
the
handwriting
of
her
few
correspondents
almost
as
well
as
she
and
this
was
a
stranger
perhaps
it
is
a
receipt
for
my
subscription
to
the
but
miss
prince
never
finished
the
sentence
for
when
she
had
fairly
taken
the
letter
into
her
hand
the
very
touch
of
it
seemed
to
send
a
tinge
of
ashen
gray
like
some
quick
poison
over
her
face
she
stood
still
looking
at
it
then
flushed
crimson
and
sat
down
in
the
nearest
chair
as
if
it
were
impossible
to
hold
herself
upright
the
captain
was
uncertain
what
he
ought
to
do
i
hope
you
have
heard
bad
news
he
said
presently
for
miss
prince
had
leaned
back
in
the
and
covered
her
eyes
with
one
hand
while
the
letter
was
tightly
held
in
the
other
it
is
from
my
niece
she
answered
slowly
you
do
mean
it
from
jack
daughter
inquired
the
captain
not
without
eagerness
he
never
had
suspected
such
a
thing
the
only
explanation
which
had
suggested
itself
to
his
mind
was
that
miss
prince
had
been
investing
some
of
her
money
without
his
advice
or
knowledge
and
he
had
gone
so
far
as
to
tell
himself
that
it
was
just
like
a
woman
and
quite
good
enough
for
her
if
she
had
lost
it
i
never
thought
of
its
being
from
her
he
said
a
little
bewildered
for
the
captain
was
not
a
man
of
quick
wit
his
powers
of
reflection
served
him
better
well
are
you
going
to
tell
me
what
she
has
to
say
for
herself
she
proposes
to
make
me
a
visit
answered
miss
prince
trying
to
smile
as
she
handed
him
the
little
sheet
of
paper
which
she
had
unconsciously
crumpled
together
but
she
did
not
give
even
one
glance
at
his
face
as
he
read
it
though
she
thought
it
a
distressingly
long
time
before
he
spoke
i
must
say
that
this
is
a
very
good
letter
very
respectful
and
said
the
captain
honestly
though
he
felt
as
if
he
had
been
expected
to
condemn
it
and
proceeded
to
read
it
through
again
this
time
aloud
my
dear
aunt
i
can
not
think
it
is
right
that
we
do
not
know
each
other
i
should
like
to
go
to
dunport
for
a
day
some
time
next
month
but
if
you
do
not
wish
to
see
me
you
have
only
to
tell
me
so
and
i
will
not
trouble
you
yours
sincerely
anna
prince
a
very
good
handwriting
too
the
captain
remarked
and
then
gathered
courage
to
say
that
he
supposed
miss
prince
would
give
her
niece
the
permission
for
which
she
asked
i
have
been
told
that
she
is
a
very
fine
girl
he
ventured
as
if
he
were
poor
ambassador
and
at
this
miss
prince
patience
gave
way
yes
i
shall
ask
her
to
come
but
i
do
not
wish
anything
said
about
it
it
need
not
be
made
the
talk
of
the
town
she
answered
her
cousin
angrily
and
then
felt
as
if
she
had
been
unjust
do
not
mind
me
walter
she
said
it
has
been
a
terrible
grief
and
trouble
to
me
all
these
years
perhaps
if
i
had
gone
to
see
those
people
and
told
them
all
i
felt
they
would
have
pitied
me
and
not
blamed
me
and
so
everything
would
have
been
better
but
it
is
too
late
now
i
know
what
sort
of
a
person
my
own
niece
is
and
i
wish
that
i
need
never
find
out
but
i
shall
try
to
do
my
duty
the
captain
was
and
seemed
quite
unmanned
but
he
gave
his
eyes
a
sudden
stroke
with
his
hand
and
turned
to
go
away
you
will
command
me
nancy
if
i
can
be
of
service
to
you
he
inquired
and
his
cousin
bowed
her
head
in
assent
it
was
indeed
a
dismal
hour
of
the
family
history
for
some
time
miss
prince
did
not
move
except
as
she
watched
captain
parish
cross
the
street
and
take
his
leisurely
way
along
the
uneven
pavement
she
was
almost
tempted
to
call
him
back
and
felt
as
if
he
were
the
last
friend
she
had
in
the
world
and
was
leaving
her
forever
but
after
she
had
allowed
the
worst
of
the
miserable
shock
to
spend
itself
she
summoned
the
stern
energy
for
which
she
was
famous
and
going
with
slower
steps
than
usual
to
the
next
room
she
unlocked
the
desk
of
the
ponderous
secretary
and
seated
herself
to
write
before
many
minutes
had
passed
the
letter
was
folded
and
sealed
and
addressed
and
the
next
evening
nan
was
reading
it
at
oldfields
she
was
grateful
for
being
asked
to
come
on
the
of
june
to
dunport
and
to
stay
a
few
days
if
it
were
convenient
and
yet
her
heart
fell
because
there
was
not
a
sign
of
welcome
or
affection
in
the
stately
fashioning
of
the
note
it
had
been
hardly
wise
to
expect
it
under
the
circumstances
the
girl
assured
herself
later
and
at
any
rate
it
was
kind
in
her
aunt
to
answer
her
own
short
letter
so
soon
xv
hostess
and
guest
nan
had
indeed
resolved
to
take
a
most
important
step
she
had
always
dismissed
the
idea
of
having
any
communication
with
her
aunt
most
contemptuously
when
she
had
first
understood
their
unhappy
position
toward
each
other
but
during
the
last
year
or
two
she
had
been
forced
to
look
at
the
relationship
from
a
wider
point
of
view
leslie
protested
that
he
had
always
treated
miss
prince
in
a
perfectly
fair
and
friendly
manner
and
that
if
she
had
chosen
to
show
no
interest
in
her
only
niece
nobody
was
to
blame
but
herself
but
nan
pleaded
that
her
aunt
was
no
longer
young
that
she
might
be
wishing
that
a
reconciliation
could
be
brought
about
the
very
fact
of
her
having
constantly
sent
the
yearly
allowance
in
spite
of
thacher
and
leslie
unwillingness
to
receive
it
appealed
to
the
young
girl
who
was
glad
to
believe
that
her
aunt
had
after
all
more
interest
in
her
than
others
cared
to
observe
she
had
no
near
relatives
except
miss
prince
there
were
some
cousins
of
old
thacher
and
their
descendants
settled
in
the
vicinity
of
oldfields
but
nan
clung
more
eagerly
to
this
one
closer
tie
of
kindred
than
she
cared
to
confess
even
to
her
guardian
it
was
too
late
now
for
any
interference
in
leslie
plans
or
usurping
of
his
affectionate
relationship
so
after
he
found
that
nan
loyal
heart
was
bent
upon
making
so
kind
a
venture
he
said
one
day
with
a
smile
that
she
had
better
write
a
letter
to
her
aunt
the
immediate
result
of
which
we
already
know
nan
had
been
studying
too
hard
and
suffering
not
a
little
from
her
city
life
and
though
the
doctor
had
been
making
a
most
charming
plan
that
later
in
the
season
they
should
take
a
journey
together
to
canada
he
said
nothing
about
that
and
told
himself
with
a
sigh
that
this
would
be
a
more
thorough
change
and
even
urged
nan
to
stay
as
long
as
she
pleased
in
dunport
if
she
found
her
aunt
house
pleasant
and
everything
went
well
for
whether
nan
liked
miss
prince
remained
to
be
proved
though
nobody
in
their
senses
could
doubt
that
miss
prince
would
be
proud
of
her
niece
it
was
not
until
after
nan
had
fairly
started
that
she
began
to
feel
at
all
dismayed
perhaps
she
had
done
a
foolish
thing
after
all
marilla
had
not
approved
the
adventure
while
at
the
last
minute
nan
had
become
suspicious
that
the
doctor
had
made
another
plan
though
she
contented
herself
with
the
remembrance
of
perfect
freedom
to
go
home
whenever
she
chose
she
told
herself
grimly
that
if
her
aunt
died
she
should
be
thankful
that
she
had
done
this
duty
yet
when
after
a
journey
of
several
hours
she
knew
that
dunport
was
the
next
station
her
heart
began
to
beat
in
a
ridiculous
manner
it
was
unlike
any
experience
that
had
ever
come
to
her
and
she
felt
strangely
unequal
to
the
occasion
long
ago
she
had
laughed
at
her
early
romances
of
her
grand
dunport
belongings
but
the
memory
of
them
lingered
still
in
spite
of
this
commonplace
approach
to
their
realities
and
she
looked
eagerly
at
the
groups
of
people
at
the
railway
station
with
a
great
hope
and
almost
certainty
that
she
should
find
her
aunt
waiting
to
meet
her
there
was
no
such
good
fortune
which
was
a
chill
at
the
outset
to
the
somewhat
tired
young
traveler
but
she
beckoned
a
driver
whom
she
had
just
ignored
and
presently
was
shut
into
a
somewhat
antiquated
public
carriage
and
on
her
way
to
miss
prince
house
so
this
was
dunport
and
in
these
very
streets
her
father
had
played
and
here
her
mother
had
become
deeper
and
deeper
involved
in
the
suffering
and
tragedy
which
had
clouded
the
end
of
her
short
life
it
seemed
to
the
young
stranger
as
if
she
must
shrink
away
from
the
curious
glances
that
stray
sent
into
the
old
carriage
and
that
she
was
going
to
be
made
very
conspicuous
by
the
interest
in
a
sad
story
which
surely
could
not
have
been
forgotten
poor
nan
she
sent
a
swift
thought
homeward
to
the
doctor
house
and
graham
even
to
the
deserted
little
place
which
had
sheltered
her
good
old
grandmother
and
herself
in
the
first
years
she
could
remember
and
with
strange
irony
came
also
a
picture
of
the
home
of
one
of
her
schoolmates
where
the
father
and
mother
and
their
children
lived
together
and
loved
each
other
the
tears
started
to
her
eyes
until
some
good
angel
whispered
the
kind
come
back
soon
nan
dear
with
which
leslie
had
let
her
go
away
the
streets
were
narrow
and
roughly
paved
in
the
old
provincial
seaport
town
the
houses
looked
a
good
deal
alike
as
they
stood
close
to
the
street
though
here
and
there
the
tops
of
some
fruit
trees
showed
themselves
over
a
high
garden
fence
and
presently
before
a
and
house
the
driver
stopped
his
horses
and
now
only
the
front
door
with
its
and
shining
knocker
stood
between
nan
and
her
aunt
the
coachman
had
given
a
resounding
summons
at
this
somewhat
formidable
entrance
before
he
turned
to
open
the
carriage
door
but
nan
had
already
alighted
and
stepped
quickly
into
the
hall
priscilla
directed
her
with
some
ceremony
to
the
south
parlor
and
a
prim
figure
turned
away
from
one
of
the
windows
that
overlooked
the
garden
and
came
forward
a
few
steps
i
suppose
this
is
anna
the
not
very
cordial
voice
began
and
faltered
and
then
miss
prince
led
her
niece
toward
the
window
she
had
left
and
without
a
thought
of
the
reserve
she
had
decided
upon
pushed
one
of
the
blinds
wide
open
and
looked
again
at
appealing
face
half
eager
herself
and
half
afraid
then
she
fumbled
for
a
handkerchief
and
betook
herself
to
the
end
of
the
sofa
and
began
to
cry
you
are
so
like
my
mother
and
jack
she
said
i
did
not
think
i
should
be
so
glad
to
see
you
the
driver
had
deposited
nan
box
and
now
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
parlor
with
priscilla
who
had
quite
lost
her
wits
with
excitement
looking
over
his
shoulder
nan
sprang
forward
glad
of
something
to
do
in
the
midst
of
her
vague
discomfort
and
at
this
sight
the
hostess
recovered
herself
and
commanding
priscilla
to
show
miss
prince
to
her
room
assumed
the
direction
of
business
affairs
the
best
bedroom
was
very
pleasant
though
somewhat
stiff
and
unused
and
nan
was
glad
to
close
its
door
and
find
herself
in
such
a
comfortable
haven
of
rest
and
refuge
from
the
teasing
details
of
that
strange
day
the
wind
had
gone
to
the
eastward
and
the
salt
odor
was
most
delightful
to
her
a
vast
inheritance
of
memories
and
associations
was
dimly
brought
to
mind
by
that
breath
of
the
sea
and
freshness
of
the
june
day
by
the
harbor
side
her
heart
leaped
at
the
thought
of
the
neighborhood
of
the
wharves
and
shipping
and
as
she
looked
out
at
the
ancient
street
she
told
herself
with
a
sense
of
great
fun
that
if
she
had
been
a
boy
she
would
inevitably
have
been
a
surgeon
in
the
navy
so
this
was
the
aunt
whom
nan
had
thought
about
and
dreamed
about
by
day
and
by
night
whose
acquaintance
had
always
been
a
waiting
pleasure
and
the
mere
fact
of
whose
existence
had
always
given
her
niece
something
to
look
forward
to
she
had
not
known
until
this
moment
what
a
reserved
pleasure
this
meeting
had
been
and
now
it
was
over
with
miss
prince
was
so
much
like
other
people
though
why
she
should
not
have
been
it
would
be
difficult
to
suggest
and
nan
taste
had
been
so
educated
and
instructed
by
her
advantages
not
to
speak
of
her
later
social
experiences
that
she
felt
at
once
that
her
aunt
world
was
smaller
than
her
own
there
was
something
very
lovable
about
miss
prince
in
spite
of
the
constraint
of
her
greeting
and
for
the
first
time
nan
understood
that
her
aunt
also
had
dreaded
the
meeting
presently
she
came
to
the
door
and
this
time
kissed
nan
affectionately
i
do
know
what
to
say
to
you
i
am
sure
she
told
the
girl
only
i
am
thankful
to
have
you
here
you
must
understand
that
it
is
a
great
event
to
me
at
which
nan
laughed
and
spoke
some
cheerful
words
miss
prince
seated
herself
by
the
other
front
window
and
looked
at
her
young
guest
with
satisfaction
this
was
no
copy
of
that
insolent
young
woman
who
had
so
beguiled
and
ruined
poor
jack
she
was
a
little
lady
who
did
honor
to
the
good
name
of
the
princes
and
lesters
a
niece
whom
anybody
might
be
proud
to
claim
and
whom
miss
prince
could
cordially
entreat
to
make
herself
quite
at
home
for
she
had
only
been
too
long
in
coming
to
her
own
and
presently
when
tea
was
served
the
careful
ordering
of
it
which
had
been
meant
partly
to
mock
and
astonish
the
girl
who
could
not
have
been
used
to
such
ways
of
living
seemed
only
a
fitting
entertainment
for
so
distinguished
a
guest
blood
will
tell
murmured
miss
prince
to
herself
as
she
clinked
the
teacups
and
looked
at
the
welcome
face
the
other
side
of
the
table
but
when
they
talked
together
in
the
evening
it
was
made
certain
that
nan
was
neither
ashamed
of
her
mother
people
nor
afraid
to
say
gravely
to
miss
prince
that
she
did
not
know
how
much
injustice
was
done
to
grandmother
thacher
if
she
believed
she
were
right
in
making
a
certain
statement
aunt
nancy
smiled
and
accepted
her
rebuff
without
any
show
of
disapproval
and
was
glad
that
the
next
day
was
sunday
so
that
she
could
take
nan
to
church
for
the
admiration
of
all
observers
she
was
even
sorry
that
she
had
not
told
young
gerry
to
come
and
pay
an
evening
visit
to
her
niece
and
spoke
of
him
once
or
twice
her
niece
observed
a
slight
at
such
times
and
wondered
a
little
who
george
gerry
might
be
nan
thought
of
many
things
before
she
fell
asleep
that
night
her
ideas
of
her
father
had
always
been
vague
and
she
had
somehow
associated
him
with
leslie
who
had
shown
her
all
the
fatherliness
she
had
ever
known
as
for
the
young
man
who
had
died
so
long
ago
if
she
had
said
that
he
seemed
to
her
like
a
younger
brother
of
leslie
it
would
have
been
nearest
the
truth
in
spite
of
the
details
of
the
short
and
disappointed
life
which
had
come
to
her
ears
ferris
had
told
her
almost
all
she
knew
of
him
but
now
that
she
was
in
her
own
father
old
home
among
the
very
same
sights
he
had
known
best
he
suddenly
appeared
to
her
in
a
vision
as
one
might
say
and
invested
himself
in
a
cloud
of
attractive
romance
his
daughter
felt
a
sudden
blaze
of
delight
at
this
first
real
consciousness
of
her
kinship
miss
prince
had
shown
her
brother
portrait
early
in
the
evening
and
had
even
taken
the
trouble
to
light
a
candle
and
hold
it
high
so
that
nan
could
see
the
handsome
boyish
face
in
which
she
recognized
quickly
the
likeness
to
her
own
he
was
only
thirteen
then
said
miss
prince
but
he
looks
several
years
older
we
all
thought
that
the
artist
had
made
a
great
mistake
when
it
was
painted
but
poor
jack
grew
to
look
like
it
yes
you
are
wonderfully
like
him
and
she
held
the
light
near
nan
face
and
studied
it
again
as
she
had
just
studied
the
picture
nan
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
she
looked
up
at
her
father
face
the
other
portraits
in
the
room
were
all
of
older
people
her
grandfather
and
grandmother
and
two
or
three
ancestors
and
miss
prince
repeated
proudly
some
anecdotes
of
the
most
distinguished
i
suppose
you
never
heard
of
them
she
added
sadly
at
the
close
but
nan
made
no
answer
it
was
certainly
no
fault
of
her
own
that
she
was
ignorant
of
many
things
and
she
would
not
confess
that
during
the
last
few
years
she
had
found
out
everything
that
was
possible
about
her
father
people
she
was
so
thankful
to
have
grown
up
in
oldfields
that
she
could
not
find
it
in
her
heart
to
rail
at
the
fate
that
had
kept
her
away
from
dunport
but
the
years
of
silence
had
been
very
unlovely
in
her
aunt
she
wondered
before
she
went
to
sleep
that
night
where
her
room
had
been
and
thought
she
would
ask
miss
prince
in
the
morning
the
windows
were
open
and
the
june
air
blew
softly
in
and
sometimes
swayed
the
curtains
of
the
bed
there
was
a
scent
of
the
sea
and
of
roses
and
presently
up
the
quiet
street
came
the
sound
of
footsteps
and
young
voices
nan
said
to
herself
that
some
party
had
been
late
in
breaking
up
and
felt
her
heart
thrill
with
sympathy
she
had
been
dwelling
altogether
in
the
past
that
evening
and
she
liked
to
hear
the
revelers
go
by
but
as
they
came
under
the
windows
she
heard
one
say
i
should
be
afraid
of
ghosts
in
that
best
room
of
miss
prince
and
then
they
suddenly
became
quiet
as
if
they
had
seen
that
the
windows
were
open
and
nan
first
felt
like
a
stranger
but
next
as
if
this
were
all
part
of
the
evening
strange
experiences
and
as
if
these
might
be
her
father
young
companions
and
she
must
call
to
them
as
they
went
by
the
next
morning
both
the
hostess
and
her
guest
waked
early
and
were
eager
for
the
time
when
they
should
see
each
other
again
the
beauty
and
quiet
of
the
sunday
morning
were
very
pleasant
and
nan
stood
for
some
minutes
at
the
windows
looking
out
on
the
small
paved
courtyard
and
the
flowers
and
green
leaves
beyond
the
garden
gate
miss
prince
was
one
of
the
fine
old
houses
which
kept
its
garden
behind
it
from
the
street
for
the
family
own
pleasure
those
are
the
same
old
bushes
and
trees
which
we
used
to
play
among
i
have
hardly
changed
it
at
all
said
miss
prince
as
she
came
in
it
must
be
confessed
that
she
had
lost
the
feeling
of
patroness
with
which
she
had
approached
her
acquaintance
with
nan
she
was
proud
and
grateful
now
and
as
she
saw
the
girl
in
her
pretty
white
dress
and
found
her
as
simple
and
affectionate
and
eager
to
please
as
she
had
thought
her
the
night
before
she
owned
to
herself
that
she
had
not
looked
for
such
happiness
to
fall
into
her
life
and
there
was
something
about
the
younger
anna
prince
which
others
had
quickly
recognized
a
power
of
direction
and
of
command
there
are
some
natures
like
the
prussian
blue
on
a
painter
palette
which
rules
all
the
other
colors
it
is
mixed
with
natures
which
quickly
make
themselves
felt
in
small
or
great
companies
nan
discovered
her
father
silver
mug
beside
her
plate
and
was
fired
with
a
fiercer
resentment
than
she
had
expected
to
feel
again
at
the
sight
of
it
the
thought
of
her
childhood
in
good
grandmother
thacher
came
quickly
to
her
mind
with
the
plain
living
to
her
share
of
which
she
had
been
made
a
thousand
times
welcome
while
by
this
richer
house
of
which
she
was
also
heir
such
rightful
trinkets
and
treasures
had
been
withheld
but
at
the
next
minute
she
could
meet
miss
prince
observant
eyes
without
displeasure
and
wisely
remembered
that
she
herself
had
not
been
responsible
for
the
state
of
affairs
and
that
possibly
her
aunt
had
been
as
wronged
and
insulted
and
beaten
back
as
she
complained
so
she
pushed
the
cup
aside
with
an
almost
careless
hand
as
a
sort
of
compromise
with
revenge
and
miss
prince
at
once
caught
sight
of
it
dear
me
she
said
not
without
confusion
priscilla
must
have
thought
you
would
be
pleased
and
then
faltered
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
you
had
always
had
it
for
your
own
my
dear
and
this
was
a
great
deal
for
miss
prince
to
say
as
any
of
her
acquaintances
could
have
told
her
nearest
relative
who
sat
almost
a
stranger
at
the
the
elder
woman
felt
a
little
and
unfamiliar
to
herself
as
she
went
up
the
stairway
to
get
ready
for
church
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
entered
upon
a
new
stage
of
existence
since
for
so
many
years
she
had
resented
the
existence
of
her
brother
child
and
had
kept
up
an
imaginary
war
in
which
she
ardently
fought
for
her
own
rights
she
had
brought
forward
reason
after
reason
why
she
must
maintain
her
position
as
representative
of
a
respected
family
who
had
been
shamed
and
disgraced
and
insulted
by
her
brother
wife
now
all
aggressors
of
her
peace
real
and
imaginary
were
routed
by
the
appearance
of
this
young
girl
upon
the
field
of
battle
which
she
traversed
with
most
innocent
and
fearless
footsteps
looking
smilingly
into
her
aunt
face
and
behaving
almost
as
if
neither
of
them
had
been
concerned
in
the
family
unhappiness
beside
nan
had
already
added
a
new
interest
to
miss
prince
life
and
as
this
defeated
warrior
took
a
best
dress
from
the
closet
without
any
of
the
usual
reflection
upon
so
important
a
step
she
felt
a
great
consciousness
of
having
been
added
to
and
enriched
as
the
person
might
who
had
suddenly
fallen
heir
to
an
unexpected
property
from
this
first
day
she
separated
herself
as
much
as
possible
from
any
thought
of
guilt
or
complicity
in
the
long
estrangement
she
seemed
to
become
used
to
her
presence
and
with
the
new
relationship
growth
there
faded
away
the
thought
of
the
past
times
if
any
one
dared
to
hint
that
it
was
a
pity
this
visit
had
been
so
long
delayed
miss
prince
grandly
ignored
all
personality
priscilla
had
come
to
the
guest
room
on
some
undeclared
errand
for
it
had
already
been
put
in
order
and
she
viewed
with
pleasure
the
simple
arrangements
for
dressing
which
were
in
one
place
and
another
about
the
room
priscilla
had
scorned
the
idea
of
putting
this
visitor
into
the
best
bedroom
and
had
had
secret
expectations
that
miss
prince
niece
would
feel
more
at
home
with
her
than
with
her
mistress
but
miss
anna
was
as
much
of
a
lady
as
miss
prince
which
was
both
pleasing
and
disappointing
as
priscilla
hoped
to
solace
some
disrespectful
feelings
of
her
own
heart
by
taking
down
miss
pride
however
her
loyalty
to
the
house
was
greater
than
her
own
very
small
grudges
and
as
she
pretended
to
have
some
difficulty
with
the
fastening
of
the
blind
she
said
in
a
whisper
aunt
like
to
have
you
make
yourself
look
pretty
which
was
such
a
reminder
of
marilla
affectionate
worldliness
that
nan
had
to
laugh
aloud
afraid
i
have
anything
grand
enough
she
told
the
departing
housekeeper
whose
pleasure
it
was
not
hard
to
discern
it
was
with
a
very
gratified
mind
that
miss
prince
walked
down
the
street
with
her
niece
and
bowed
to
one
and
another
of
her
acquaintances
she
was
entirely
careless
of
what
any
one
should
say
but
she
was
brimful
of
excitement
and
answered
several
of
questions
entirely
wrong
the
old
town
was
very
pleasant
that
sunday
morning
the
lilacs
were
in
full
bloom
and
other
early
summer
flowers
in
the
narrow
strips
of
or
the
gardens
were
in
blossom
too
and
the
air
was
full
of
sweetness
and
delight
the
ancient
seaport
had
gathered
for
itself
quaint
names
and
treasures
it
was
pleased
with
its
old
fashions
and
noble
memories
its
ancient
bells
had
not
lost
their
sweet
voices
and
a
flavor
of
the
past
pervaded
everything
the
comfortable
houses
the
elderly
citizens
the
very
names
on
the
shop
signs
and
the
worn
cobblestones
of
the
streets
and
flagstones
of
the
pavements
delighted
the
young
stranger
who
felt
so
unreasonably
at
home
in
dunport
the
many
faces
that
had
been
colored
and
fashioned
by
the
sea
were
strangely
different
from
those
which
had
known
an
inland
life
only
and
she
seemed
to
have
come
a
great
deal
nearer
to
foreign
life
and
to
the
last
century
her
heart
softened
as
she
wondered
if
her
father
knew
that
she
was
following
his
boyish
footsteps
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
on
that
sunday
morning
she
would
have
liked
to
wander
away
by
herself
and
find
her
way
about
the
town
but
such
a
proposal
was
not
to
be
thought
of
and
all
at
once
miss
nancy
turned
up
a
narrow
side
street
toward
a
brick
church
and
presently
they
walked
side
by
side
up
the
broad
aisle
so
far
that
it
seemed
to
nan
as
if
her
aunt
were
aiming
for
the
chancel
itself
and
had
some
public
ceremony
in
view
of
a
penitential
nature
they
were
by
no
means
early
and
the
girl
was
disagreeably
aware
of
a
little
rustle
of
eagerness
and
curiosity
as
she
took
her
seat
and
was
glad
to
have
fairly
gained
the
shelter
of
the
pew
as
she
bent
her
head
but
miss
prince
the
senior
seemed
calm
she
said
her
prayer
settled
herself
as
usual
putting
the
footstool
in
its
right
place
and
finding
the
psalms
and
the
collect
she
then
laid
the
on
the
cushion
beside
her
and
folded
her
hands
in
her
lap
before
she
turned
discreetly
to
say
to
miss
fraley
and
exchange
greetings
until
the
clergyman
made
his
appearance
nan
had
taken
the
seat
next
the
pew
door
and
was
looking
about
her
with
great
interest
forgetting
herself
and
her
aunt
as
she
wondered
that
so
dear
and
quaint
a
place
of
worship
should
be
still
left
in
her
iconoclastic
native
country
she
had
seen
nothing
even
in
boston
like
this
there
were
so
many
antique
splendors
about
the
chancel
and
many
mural
tablets
on
the
walls
where
she
read
with
sudden
delight
her
own
family
name
and
the
list
of
virtues
which
had
belonged
to
some
of
her
ancestors
the
dear
old
place
there
never
had
been
and
never
could
be
any
church
like
it
it
seemed
to
have
been
waiting
all
her
life
for
her
to
come
to
say
her
prayers
where
so
many
of
her
own
people
had
brought
their
sins
and
sorrows
in
the
long
years
that
were
gone
she
only
wished
that
the
doctor
were
with
her
and
the
same
feeling
that
used
to
make
her
watch
for
him
in
her
childhood
until
he
smiled
back
again
filled
all
her
loving
and
grateful
heart
she
knew
that
he
must
be
thinking
of
her
that
morning
he
was
not
in
church
himself
he
had
planned
a
long
drive
to
the
next
town
but
one
to
see
a
dying
man
who
seemed
to
be
helped
only
by
this
beloved
physician
presence
there
had
been
some
talk
between
leslie
and
nan
about
a
medicine
which
might
possibly
be
of
use
and
she
found
herself
thinking
about
that
again
and
again
she
had
reminded
the
doctor
of
it
and
he
had
seemed
very
pleased
it
must
be
longer
ago
than
yesterday
since
she
left
oldfields
it
already
counted
for
half
a
lifetime
one
listener
at
least
was
not
resentful
because
the
sermon
was
neither
wise
nor
great
for
she
had
so
many
things
to
think
of
but
while
she
was
sometimes
lost
in
her
own
thoughts
nan
stole
a
look
at
the
thinly
filled
galleries
now
and
then
and
at
one
time
was
pleased
with
the
sight
of
the
cherubs
which
seemed
to
have
been
caught
like
clumsy
insects
and
pinned
as
a
sort
of
tawdry
decoration
above
the
tablets
where
the
apostle
creed
and
the
ten
commandments
were
printed
in
faded
gilt
letters
the
letter
s
was
made
long
in
these
copies
and
the
capitals
were
of
an
almost
forgotten
pattern
and
after
nan
had
discovered
her
grandfather
name
in
the
she
held
and
had
tried
again
to
listen
to
the
discourse
she
smiled
at
the
discovery
of
a
familiar
face
in
one
of
the
wall
pews
it
somehow
gave
her
a
feeling
of
security
as
being
a
link
with
her
past
experiences
and
she
looked
eagerly
again
and
again
until
this
old
acquaintance
who
also
was
a
stranger
and
a
guest
in
dunport
happened
to
direct
a
careless
glance
toward
her
and
a
somewhat
dull
and
gloomy
expression
was
changed
for
surprised
and
curious
recognition
when
church
was
over
at
last
miss
prince
seemed
to
have
a
great
deal
to
say
to
her
neighbor
in
the
next
pew
and
nan
stood
in
her
place
waiting
until
her
aunt
was
ready
more
than
one
person
had
lingered
to
make
sure
of
a
distinct
impression
of
the
interesting
stranger
who
had
made
one
of
the
morning
congregation
and
nan
smiled
suddenly
as
she
thought
that
it
might
seem
proper
that
she
and
her
aunt
should
walk
down
the
aisle
together
as
if
they
had
been
married
or
as
if
the
ceremony
were
finished
which
she
had
anticipated
as
they
came
in
and
miss
prince
did
make
an
admirable
exit
from
the
church
mustering
all
her
and
taking
stately
steps
at
her
niece
side
while
she
sometimes
politely
greeted
her
acquaintances
there
were
flickering
spots
of
color
in
her
cheeks
when
they
were
again
in
the
street
it
is
really
the
first
day
this
summer
when
i
have
needed
my
parasol
said
aunt
nancy
as
she
unfurled
the
carefully
preserved
article
of
her
wardrobe
and
held
it
primly
aloft
i
am
so
sorry
that
our
rector
was
absent
this
morning
i
suppose
that
you
have
attended
an
episcopal
church
sometimes
i
am
glad
that
you
seem
to
be
familiar
with
the
service
to
which
nancy
replied
that
she
had
been
confirmed
while
she
was
first
at
and
this
seemed
to
give
her
aunt
great
satisfaction
very
natural
and
proper
my
dear
she
said
it
is
one
thing
i
have
always
wished
when
i
thought
of
you
at
serious
moments
but
i
was
persuaded
that
you
were
far
from
such
influences
and
that
there
would
be
nothing
in
your
surroundings
to
encourage
your
inherited
love
of
the
church
i
have
always
liked
it
best
said
nan
who
seemed
all
at
once
to
grow
taller
but
i
think
one
should
care
more
about
being
a
good
woman
than
a
good
episcopalian
aunt
nancy
no
doubt
said
the
elder
woman
a
little
confused
and
dismayed
though
she
presently
rallied
her
forces
and
justly
observed
that
the
rules
of
the
church
were
a
means
to
the
end
of
good
living
and
happily
before
any
existing
differences
of
opinion
could
be
discovered
they
were
interrupted
by
a
young
man
who
lifted
his
hat
and
gracefully
accepted
his
introduction
to
the
younger
miss
prince
this
is
george
gerry
anna
one
of
my
young
friends
smiled
aunt
nancy
and
saying
as
she
walked
more
slowly
you
must
come
to
see
us
soon
for
i
shall
have
to
depend
upon
the
younger
people
to
make
my
niece
stay
agreeable
i
was
looking
forward
to
my
sunday
evening
visit
the
wayfarer
said
hesitatingly
you
have
not
told
me
yet
that
i
must
not
come
which
appeal
was
only
answered
by
a
little
laugh
from
all
three
as
they
separated
and
miss
prince
had
time
to
be
quite
eloquent
in
her
favorite
praise
before
they
reached
home
nan
thought
her
first
dunport
acquaintance
very
pleasant
and
frankly
said
so
this
seemed
to
be
very
gratifying
to
her
aunt
and
they
walked
toward
home
together
by
a
roundabout
way
and
in
excellent
spirits
it
seemed
more
and
more
absurd
to
nan
that
the
long
feud
and
almost
tragic
state
of
family
affairs
should
have
come
to
so
prosaic
a
conclusion
and
that
she
who
had
been
the
skeleton
of
her
aunt
ancestral
closet
should
have
dared
to
emerge
and
to
walk
by
her
side
through
the
town
after
all
here
was
another
proof
of
the
wisdom
of
the
old
spanish
proverb
that
it
takes
two
to
make
a
quarrel
but
only
one
to
end
it
xvi
a
june
sunday
it
was
miss
prince
custom
to
indulge
herself
by
taking
a
long
sunday
afternoon
nap
in
summer
though
on
this
occasion
she
spoke
of
it
to
her
niece
as
only
a
short
rest
she
was
glad
to
gain
the
shelter
of
her
own
room
and
as
she
brushed
a
little
dust
from
her
handsome
silk
gown
before
putting
it
away
she
held
it
at
arm
length
and
shook
it
almost
indignantly
then
she
hesitated
a
moment
and
looked
around
the
comfortable
apartment
with
a
fierce
disdain
i
wonder
what
gives
me
such
a
sense
of
importance
she
whispered
i
have
been
making
mistakes
my
whole
life
long
and
giving
excuses
to
myself
for
not
doing
my
duty
i
wish
i
had
made
her
a
proper
allowance
to
say
the
least
everybody
must
be
laughing
at
me
and
miss
prince
actually
stamped
her
foot
it
had
been
difficult
to
keep
up
an
appearance
of
but
her
pride
had
helped
her
in
that
laudable
effort
and
as
she
lay
down
on
the
couch
she
tried
to
satisfy
herself
with
the
assurance
that
her
niece
should
have
her
rights
now
and
be
treated
justly
at
last
miss
fraley
had
come
in
to
pay
a
brief
visit
on
her
way
to
just
as
they
finished
dinner
and
had
asked
nan
to
tea
the
following
wednesday
expressing
also
a
hope
that
she
would
come
sooner
to
call
quite
without
ceremony
finding
the
state
of
affairs
so
pleasant
miss
eunice
ventured
to
say
that
nan
father
had
been
a
favorite
of
her
mother
who
was
now
of
uncommon
age
miss
prince
became
suddenly
stern
but
it
was
only
a
passing
cloud
which
disturbed
nobody
nan
had
accepted
willingly
the
offered
apologies
and
gayly
wished
her
aunt
a
pleasant
dream
but
being
wide
awake
she
gladly
made
use
of
the
quiet
time
to
send
a
letter
home
and
to
stroll
down
the
garden
afterward
it
all
seemed
so
unlike
what
she
had
expected
yet
her
former
thoughts
about
her
aunt
were
much
more
difficult
to
recall
as
every
hour
went
by
and
made
the
impression
of
actual
things
more
distinct
her
fancied
duty
to
a
lonely
old
lady
who
mourned
over
a
sad
past
seemed
quite
quixotic
when
she
watched
this
brisk
woman
come
and
go
without
any
hindrance
of
age
or
now
that
the
first
meeting
was
over
any
appearance
of
former
melancholy
as
our
friend
went
down
the
garden
she
told
herself
that
she
was
glad
to
have
come
it
was
quite
right
and
it
was
very
pleasant
though
there
was
no
particular
use
in
staying
there
long
and
after
a
few
days
she
would
go
away
somehow
her
life
seemed
a
great
deal
larger
for
this
new
experience
and
she
would
try
to
repeat
the
visit
occasionally
she
wished
to
get
dunport
itself
by
heart
but
she
had
become
so
used
to
giving
the
best
of
herself
to
her
studies
that
she
was
a
little
shy
of
the
visiting
and
the
and
the
apparently
fruitless
society
life
of
which
she
had
already
learned
something
i
suppose
the
doctor
would
say
it
is
good
for
me
said
nan
somewhat
grimly
but
i
think
it
is
most
satisfactory
to
be
with
the
persons
whose
interests
and
purposes
are
the
same
as
one
own
the
feeling
of
a
lack
of
connection
with
the
people
whom
she
had
met
made
life
appear
somewhat
blank
she
had
already
gained
a
certain
degree
of
affection
for
her
aunt
to
say
the
least
she
was
puzzled
to
account
for
such
an
implacable
hostility
as
had
lasted
for
years
in
the
breast
of
a
person
so
apparently
friendly
and
cordial
in
her
relations
with
her
neighbors
our
heroine
was
slow
to
recognize
in
her
relative
the
same
strength
of
will
and
of
determination
which
made
the
framework
of
her
own
character
an
firmness
of
structure
which
could
not
be
easily
shaken
by
the
changes
or
opinions
of
other
people
miss
prince
acquaintances
called
her
a
very
set
person
and
were
shy
of
intruding
into
her
secret
fastnesses
there
were
all
the
traits
of
character
which
are
necessary
for
the
groundwork
of
an
enterprising
life
but
miss
prince
seemed
to
have
neither
inherited
nor
acquired
any
high
aims
or
any
especial
and
fruitful
so
her
gifts
of
persistence
and
had
ranked
themselves
for
the
defense
of
a
comparatively
unimportant
and
commonplace
existence
as
has
been
said
she
forbade
years
before
any
mention
of
her
family
troubles
and
had
lived
on
before
the
world
as
if
they
could
be
annihilated
and
not
only
were
not
observable
but
never
had
been
in
a
more
thoughtful
and
active
circle
of
social
life
the
contrast
between
her
rare
capacity
and
her
unnoticeable
career
would
have
been
more
striking
she
stood
as
a
fine
representative
of
the
old
school
but
it
could
not
be
justly
said
that
she
was
a
forward
scholar
since
however
sure
of
some
of
her
early
lessons
she
was
most
dull
and
reluctant
before
new
ones
of
various
enlightening
and
uplifting
descriptions
nan
had
observed
that
her
aunt
had
looked
very
tired
and
spent
as
she
went
after
dinner
and
understood
better
than
she
had
before
that
this
visit
was
moving
the
waters
of
miss
prince
soul
more
deeply
than
had
been
suspected
she
gained
a
new
sympathy
and
as
the
hours
of
the
summer
afternoon
went
by
she
thought
of
a
great
many
things
which
had
not
been
quite
plain
to
her
and
strolled
about
the
garden
until
she
knew
that
by
heart
and
had
made
friends
with
the
disorderly
company
of
and
periwinkles
which
had
cropped
up
everywhere
as
if
the
earth
were
capable
of
turning
itself
into
such
small
blossoms
without
anybody
help
after
so
many
years
of
unvarying
tuition
the
and
had
a
most
venerable
look
and
the
were
in
dismal
mourning
of
black
knots
there
was
a
damp
and
shady
corner
where
nan
found
a
great
many
lilies
of
the
valley
still
lingering
though
they
had
some
time
ago
gone
out
of
bloom
in
the
more
sunshiny
garden
at
oldfields
she
remembered
that
there
were
no
flowers
in
the
house
and
gathered
a
great
handful
at
last
of
one
sort
and
another
to
carry
in
the
was
very
dark
and
nan
wished
at
first
to
throw
open
the
blinds
which
had
been
carefully
closed
it
seemed
too
early
in
the
summer
to
shut
out
the
sunshine
but
it
seemed
also
a
little
too
soon
to
interfere
with
the
housekeeping
and
so
she
brought
two
or
three
tall
champagne
glasses
from
a
high
shelf
of
the
closet
and
filled
them
with
her
posies
and
after
putting
them
in
their
places
went
back
to
the
garden
there
was
a
perfect
silence
in
the
house
except
for
the
sound
of
the
tall
clock
in
the
and
it
seemed
very
lonely
she
had
taken
another
long
look
at
her
father
portrait
but
as
she
shut
the
garden
gate
after
her
she
smiled
at
the
thought
of
her
unusual
idleness
and
wondered
if
it
need
last
until
tuesday
which
was
the
day
she
had
fixed
upon
for
her
departure
nan
wished
that
she
dared
to
go
away
for
a
long
walk
it
was
a
pity
she
had
not
told
her
aunt
of
a
wish
to
see
something
of
the
town
and
of
the
that
afternoon
but
it
would
certainly
be
a
little
strange
if
she
were
to
disappear
and
very
likely
the
long
nap
would
soon
come
to
an
end
being
well
taught
in
the
details
of
gardening
she
took
a
knife
from
her
pocket
and
pruned
and
trained
the
shrubs
and
vines
and
sang
softly
to
herself
as
she
thought
about
her
next
winter
study
and
her
plans
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
and
also
decided
that
she
would
insist
upon
the
doctor
going
away
with
her
for
a
journey
when
she
reached
home
again
after
a
little
while
she
heard
her
aunt
open
the
blinds
of
the
garden
door
and
call
her
in
most
friendly
tones
and
when
she
reached
the
house
miss
prince
was
in
the
south
parlor
entertaining
a
visitor
captain
walter
parish
who
had
gladly
availed
himself
of
some
trifling
excuse
of
a
business
nature
which
involved
the
signing
and
sending
of
a
paper
by
the
early
post
of
next
day
he
was
going
to
his
daughter
to
tea
and
it
was
quite
a
long
drive
to
her
house
so
he
had
not
dared
to
put
off
his
errand
he
explained
lest
he
should
be
detained
in
the
evening
but
he
had
been
also
longing
to
take
a
look
at
miss
prince
guest
his
wife
went
to
another
church
and
he
dutifully
accompanied
her
though
he
had
been
brought
up
with
miss
prince
at
old
ann
so
this
is
my
young
cousin
said
the
captain
gallantly
and
with
great
simplicity
and
tenderness
held
both
nan
hands
and
looked
full
in
her
face
a
moment
before
he
kissed
her
then
to
miss
prince
great
discomposure
and
embarrassment
he
turned
to
the
window
and
looked
out
without
saying
a
word
though
he
drew
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his
eyes
in
as
if
he
wished
to
make
them
clear
while
he
sighted
something
on
the
horizon
miss
prince
thought
it
was
all
nonsense
and
would
have
liked
to
say
so
though
she
trusted
that
her
silence
was
eloquent
enough
she
brings
back
the
past
said
captain
walter
as
he
returned
presently
and
seated
himself
where
he
could
look
at
nan
as
much
as
he
liked
she
brings
back
the
past
you
were
speaking
of
old
captain
slater
reminded
miss
prince
with
some
dignity
i
just
came
from
there
said
captain
parish
with
his
eyes
still
fixed
on
his
young
relative
though
it
was
with
such
a
friendly
gaze
that
nan
was
growing
fonder
of
him
every
minute
they
told
me
he
was
about
the
same
as
yesterday
i
offered
to
watch
with
him
night
and
how
do
you
like
the
looks
of
dunport
my
dear
nan
answered
eagerly
with
brightening
face
and
added
that
she
was
longing
to
see
more
of
it
the
old
wharves
especially
now
that
good
said
the
captain
i
wonder
if
you
would
care
anything
about
taking
a
stroll
with
me
in
the
morning
your
aunt
here
is
a
famous
housekeeper
and
will
be
glad
to
get
you
off
her
hands
i
dare
say
nan
eagerly
accepted
and
though
it
was
suggested
that
miss
prince
had
a
plan
for
showing
the
town
in
the
afternoon
she
was
promptly
told
that
there
was
nothing
easier
than
taking
both
these
pleasant
opportunities
you
would
lose
yourself
among
the
old
storehouses
sure
nancy
laughed
the
old
sailor
and
you
must
let
me
have
my
way
it
a
chance
one
does
get
every
day
to
tell
the
old
dunport
stories
to
a
new
listener
some
one
had
opened
the
front
door
and
was
heard
coming
along
the
hall
this
is
very
kind
george
said
miss
prince
with
much
pleasure
while
the
captain
looked
a
little
disconcerted
at
his
young
rival
he
assured
himself
that
he
would
make
a
long
morning
cruise
of
it
next
day
with
this
attractive
sightseer
and
for
once
the
young
beaux
would
be
at
a
disadvantage
the
girls
of
his
own
day
used
to
think
him
one
of
the
best
of
their
gallants
and
at
this
thought
the
captain
was
invincible
gerry
must
take
the
second
chance
the
blinds
were
open
now
and
the
old
room
seemed
very
pleasant
brown
hair
had
been
blown
about
not
a
little
in
the
garden
and
as
she
sat
at
the
end
of
the
long
sofa
a
ray
of
sunshine
touched
the
glass
of
a
picture
behind
her
and
flew
forward
again
to
tangle
itself
in
her
stray
locks
so
that
altogether
there
was
a
sort
of
golden
halo
about
her
pretty
head
and
young
gerry
thought
he
had
never
seen
anything
so
charming
the
white
frock
was
a
welcome
addition
to
the
usually
sombre
room
and
his
eyes
quickly
saw
the
flowers
on
the
table
he
knew
instantly
that
the
bouquet
was
none
of
miss
prince
gathering
i
hope
you
wo
think
i
mean
to
stay
as
much
too
late
as
i
have
come
too
early
he
laughed
i
must
go
away
soon
after
tea
for
i
have
promised
to
talk
with
the
captain
of
a
schooner
which
is
to
sail
in
the
morning
wills
luckily
found
out
that
he
could
give
some
evidence
in
a
case
we
are
working
up
the
collision
asked
captain
parish
eagerly
i
was
wondering
when
i
saw
the
highflyer
foremast
between
the
buildings
on
fleet
street
as
i
went
to
meeting
if
they
were
going
to
let
her
lie
there
and
i
do
think
she
being
taken
proper
care
of
i
must
say
i
hate
to
see
a
good
vessel
go
to
ruin
when
there
no
need
of
it
the
man
in
charge
was
recommended
very
highly
and
everything
seemed
to
be
all
right
when
i
was
on
board
one
day
this
week
said
young
gerry
and
turned
to
explain
to
nan
that
this
vessel
had
been
damaged
by
collision
with
another
and
the
process
of
settling
the
matter
by
litigation
had
been
provokingly
slow
the
captain
listened
with
impatience
i
dare
say
she
looked
very
well
to
your
eyes
but
i
rather
have
an
old
word
for
it
than
a
young
lawyer
i
have
boarded
her
for
some
weeks
i
dare
say
was
before
the
snow
was
gone
but
she
certainly
needed
attention
then
i
saw
some
places
in
the
sheathing
and
planking
there
ought
to
be
a
coat
of
paint
soon
and
plenty
of
tar
carried
aloft
besides
or
there
be
a
long
bill
for
somebody
to
pay
before
she
seaworthy
i
wish
you
would
make
a
careful
inspection
of
her
said
the
young
man
with
gratifying
deference
i
do
doubt
that
it
is
necessary
i
will
see
that
you
are
well
satisfied
for
your
services
of
course
the
captain
himself
should
have
stayed
there
and
kept
charge
but
you
remember
he
was
sick
and
had
to
resign
he
looks
feeble
yet
i
hope
nothing
will
happen
to
him
before
the
matter
is
settled
up
but
we
are
sure
of
the
trial
in
september
she
going
to
be
rigged
with
some
of
your
red
tape
i
afraid
said
captain
parish
with
great
friendliness
i
do
see
any
reason
why
i
ca
look
her
over
morning
i
obliged
to
you
or
at
least
make
a
beginning
and
he
gave
a
most
knowing
nod
at
nan
as
if
they
would
divide
the
pleasure
i
make
the
excuse
of
showing
this
young
lady
the
construction
of
a
merchant
vessel
and
then
the
keeper
ca
feel
affronted
she
is
going
to
take
a
stroll
with
me
along
the
wharves
he
concluded
triumphantly
while
gerry
looked
wistful
for
a
moment
and
miss
prince
quickly
took
advantage
of
a
pause
in
the
conversation
to
ask
if
he
knew
whether
anything
pleasant
was
going
forward
among
the
young
people
this
week
she
did
not
wish
her
niece
to
have
too
dull
a
visit
some
of
us
are
going
up
the
river
very
soon
said
the
young
man
with
eager
pleasure
looking
at
nan
it
would
be
so
pleasant
if
miss
prince
would
join
us
we
think
our
dunport
supper
parties
of
that
sort
would
be
hard
to
match
the
young
folks
will
all
be
flocking
here
by
said
the
captain
and
miss
prince
answered
surely
in
a
tone
of
command
rather
than
entreaty
she
knew
very
well
how
the
news
of
nan
coming
must
be
flying
about
the
town
and
she
almost
regretted
the
fact
of
her
own
previous
silence
about
this
great
event
in
the
mean
time
nan
was
talking
to
the
two
gentlemen
as
if
she
had
already
been
to
her
room
to
smooth
her
hair
which
her
aunt
looked
at
reproachfully
from
time
to
time
though
the
sunshine
had
not
wholly
left
it
the
girl
was
quite
unconscious
of
herself
and
glad
to
have
the
company
and
sympathy
of
these
kind
friends
she
thought
once
that
if
she
had
a
brother
she
would
like
him
to
be
of
young
gerry
fashion
he
had
none
of
the
manner
which
constantly
insisted
upon
her
remembering
that
he
was
a
man
and
she
a
girl
she
could
be
good
friends
with
him
in
the
same
way
that
she
had
been
with
some
oldfields
schoolfellows
and
after
the
captain
had
reluctantly
taken
his
leave
they
had
a
pleasant
talk
about
life
and
their
rides
and
walks
and
were
soon
exchanging
experiences
in
a
way
that
miss
nancy
smiled
upon
gladly
it
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
she
could
not
get
used
to
so
great
a
change
in
her
life
she
could
not
feel
sure
yet
that
she
no
longer
had
a
secret
and
that
this
was
the
niece
whom
she
had
so
many
years
dreaded
and
disclaimed
george
gerry
had
taken
the
niece
place
in
her
affections
yet
here
was
anna
her
own
namesake
who
showed
plainly
in
so
many
ways
the
same
descent
as
herself
being
as
much
a
prince
as
herself
in
spite
of
her
mother
low
origin
and
worse
personal
traits
and
the
loutish
companions
to
whom
she
had
always
persuaded
herself
poor
nan
was
akin
and
it
was
by
no
means
sure
that
the
last
of
the
princes
was
not
the
best
of
them
she
was
very
proud
of
her
brother
daughter
and
was
more
at
a
loss
to
know
how
to
make
excuses
for
being
shortsighted
and
neglectful
miss
prince
hated
to
think
that
nan
had
any
but
the
pleasantest
associations
with
her
nearest
relative
she
must
surely
keep
the
girl
affection
now
she
meant
to
insist
at
any
rate
upon
dunport
being
her
niece
home
for
the
future
though
undoubtedly
it
would
be
hard
at
first
to
break
with
the
many
associations
of
oldfields
she
must
write
that
very
night
to
leslie
to
thank
him
for
his
care
and
to
again
express
her
regret
that
anna
misguided
young
mother
should
have
placed
such
restrictions
upon
the
child
relations
with
her
nearest
of
kin
and
so
have
broken
the
natural
ties
of
nature
and
she
would
not
stop
there
she
would
blame
herself
generously
and
say
how
sorry
she
was
that
she
had
been
governed
by
her
painful
recollections
of
a
time
she
should
now
strive
to
forget
leslie
must
be
asked
to
come
and
join
his
ward
for
a
few
days
and
then
they
would
settle
her
plans
for
the
future
she
should
give
her
niece
a
handsome
allowance
at
any
rate
and
then
as
miss
prince
looked
across
the
room
and
forgot
her
own
thoughts
in
listening
to
the
young
people
friendly
talk
a
sudden
purpose
flashed
through
her
mind
the
dream
of
her
heart
began
to
unfold
itself
slowly
could
anything
be
so
suitable
so
comforting
to
her
own
mind
as
that
they
should
marry
each
other
two
days
before
her
pleasure
and
pride
in
the
manly
fellow
who
was
almost
as
dear
to
her
as
an
own
son
could
be
would
have
been
greatly
shocked
but
miss
prince
heart
began
to
beat
quickly
it
would
be
such
a
blessed
solution
of
all
the
puzzles
and
troubles
of
her
life
if
she
could
have
both
the
young
people
near
her
through
the
years
that
remained
and
when
she
died
or
even
before
they
could
live
here
in
the
old
house
and
begin
a
new
and
better
order
of
things
in
the
place
of
her
own
failures
and
shortcomings
it
was
all
so
distinct
and
possible
in
miss
prince
mind
that
only
time
seemed
necessary
and
even
the
time
could
be
made
short
she
would
not
put
any
hindrances
between
them
and
their
blessed
decision
as
she
went
by
them
to
seek
priscilla
she
smoothed
the
cushion
which
nan
had
leaned
upon
before
she
moved
a
little
nearer
george
gerry
in
some
sudden
excitement
of
the
conversation
which
had
begun
while
the
captain
was
still
there
and
there
was
a
needless
distance
between
them
then
miss
prince
let
her
hand
rest
for
a
minute
on
the
girl
soft
hair
you
must
ask
gerry
to
excuse
you
for
a
few
minutes
my
dear
you
have
been
quite
blown
about
in
the
garden
i
meant
to
join
you
there
it
is
a
dear
old
garden
said
nan
i
ca
help
being
almost
as
fond
of
it
already
as
i
am
of
ours
at
home
but
though
aunt
unwonted
caress
had
been
so
unlike
her
conduct
in
general
this
reference
to
oldfields
called
her
to
her
senses
and
she
went
quickly
away
she
did
not
like
to
hear
nan
speak
in
such
loving
fashion
of
a
house
where
she
had
no
real
right
but
when
george
gerry
was
left
alone
he
had
pleasant
thoughts
come
flocking
in
to
keep
him
company
in
the
ladies
stead
he
had
not
dreamed
of
such
a
pleasure
as
this
who
could
have
and
what
could
aunt
nancy
think
of
herself
it
is
such
a
holiday
said
nan
when
tea
was
fairly
begun
and
her
new
friend
was
acknowledging
an
uncommon
attack
of
hunger
and
they
were
all
merry
in
a
sedate
way
to
suit
miss
prince
ideas
and
preferences
i
have
been
quite
the
drudge
this
winter
over
my
studies
and
i
feel
young
and
idle
again
now
that
i
am
making
all
these
pleasant
plans
for
gerry
had
been
talking
enthusiastically
about
some
excursions
he
should
arrange
to
certain
charming
places
in
the
region
of
dunport
both
he
and
miss
prince
smiled
when
nan
announced
that
she
was
young
and
idle
and
a
moment
afterward
the
aunt
asked
doubtfully
about
her
niece
studies
she
supposed
that
anna
was
done
with
schools
nan
stopped
her
hand
as
it
reached
for
the
cup
which
miss
prince
had
just
filled
school
yes
she
answered
somewhat
bewildered
but
you
know
i
am
studying
medicine
this
most
important
of
all
facts
had
been
so
present
to
her
own
mind
even
in
the
excitement
and
novelty
of
her
new
surroundings
that
she
could
not
understand
that
her
aunt
was
still
entirely
ignorant
of
the
great
purpose
of
her
life
what
do
you
mean
demanded
miss
prince
coldly
and
quickly
explained
to
their
somewhat
amused
and
astonished
companion
my
niece
has
been
the
ward
of
a
distinguished
physician
and
it
is
quite
natural
she
should
have
become
interested
in
his
pursuits
but
i
am
really
studying
medicine
it
is
to
be
my
profession
persisted
nan
fearlessly
though
she
was
sorry
that
she
had
spoiled
the
harmony
of
the
little
company
and
my
whole
heart
is
in
it
aunt
nancy
nonsense
my
dear
returned
miss
prince
who
had
recovered
her
partially
your
father
gave
promise
of
attaining
great
eminence
in
a
profession
that
was
very
proper
for
him
but
i
thought
better
of
leslie
than
this
i
can
not
understand
his
indulgence
of
such
a
silly
notion
george
gerry
felt
very
uncomfortable
he
had
been
a
good
deal
shocked
but
he
had
a
strong
impulse
to
rush
into
the
field
as
nan
champion
though
it
were
quite
against
his
conscience
she
had
been
too
long
in
a
humdrum
with
no
companion
but
an
elderly
medical
man
and
after
a
little
pause
he
made
a
trifling
joke
about
their
making
the
best
of
the
holiday
and
the
talk
was
changed
to
other
subjects
the
tide
was
strong
against
our
heroine
but
she
had
been
assailed
before
and
had
no
idea
of
sorrowing
yet
over
a
lost
cause
and
for
once
miss
prince
was
in
a
hurry
for
gerry
to
go
away
xvii
by
the
river
as
nan
went
down
the
street
next
morning
with
captain
parish
who
had
been
most
prompt
in
keeping
his
appointment
they
were
met
by
gerry
and
a
young
girl
who
proved
to
be
captain
parish
niece
and
the
bearer
of
a
cordial
invitation
it
would
be
just
the
evening
for
a
and
it
was
hoped
that
miss
prince
the
younger
would
be
ready
to
go
up
the
river
at
five
dear
me
yes
said
the
captain
your
aunt
will
be
pleased
to
have
you
go
i
sure
these
idle
young
folks
must
expect
us
to
turn
back
now
though
to
have
a
visit
from
you
we
have
no
end
of
business
on
hand
if
miss
prince
will
remember
that
i
was
really
on
my
way
to
see
her
said
mary
parish
pleasantly
while
she
looked
with
eager
interest
at
the
stranger
the
two
girls
were
quite
ready
to
be
friends
we
will
just
stop
to
tell
your
aunt
lest
she
should
make
some
other
plan
for
you
she
added
giving
nan
a
nod
that
was
almost
affectionate
we
have
hardly
used
the
boats
this
year
it
has
been
such
a
cold
late
spring
and
we
hope
for
a
very
good
evening
george
and
i
will
call
for
you
and
george
who
had
been
listening
to
a
suggestion
about
the
ship
business
smiled
with
pleasure
as
they
separated
nice
young
people
announced
the
captain
who
was
in
a
sympathetic
mood
there
has
been
some
reason
for
thinking
that
they
meant
to
take
up
with
each
other
for
good
and
all
i
do
know
that
either
of
them
could
do
better
though
i
like
the
girl
best
that
natural
she
my
brother
daughter
and
i
was
her
guardian
she
only
came
of
age
last
year
her
father
and
yours
were
boys
together
younger
than
i
am
by
a
dozen
years
both
gone
before
me
too
sighed
the
captain
and
quickly
changed
so
sad
a
subject
by
directing
his
companion
attention
to
one
of
the
old
houses
and
telling
the
story
of
it
as
they
walked
along
luckily
they
had
the
highflyer
all
to
themselves
when
they
reached
the
wharf
for
the
keeper
had
gone
up
into
the
town
and
his
wife
who
had
set
up
a
frugal
housekeeping
in
the
captain
cabin
sat
in
the
shade
of
the
house
with
her
sewing
the
monday
washing
having
been
early
spread
to
the
breeze
in
a
corner
of
the
main
deck
she
accepted
captain
parish
explanations
of
his
presence
with
equanimity
and
seemed
surprised
and
amused
at
the
young
landswoman
curiosity
and
eagerness
for
a
ship
was
as
commonplace
to
herself
as
any
ashore
dear
me
you
would
know
it
was
the
same
place
said
the
captain
in
the
course
of
his
enumeration
of
the
ropes
and
yards
and
other
mysterious
furnishings
of
the
old
craft
with
a
good
crew
aboard
this
deck
is
as
busy
as
a
town
every
day
i
do
know
how
i
going
below
until
the
keeper
gets
back
i
suppose
you
do
want
me
to
show
you
the
road
to
the
once
i
knew
it
as
well
as
anybody
and
i
could
make
quicker
time
now
than
most
of
the
youngsters
and
the
captain
gave
a
knowing
glance
aloft
while
at
this
moment
somebody
crossed
the
gangway
plank
it
was
a
old
sailor
who
was
a
familiar
sight
in
dunport
mornin
to
you
sir
and
the
master
of
the
highflyer
for
the
time
being
returned
the
salute
with
a
mixture
of
dignity
and
friendliness
goin
to
take
command
chuckled
the
bent
old
fellow
i
like
to
ship
under
ye
be
the
first
time
and
he
gave
his
hat
an
unsettling
shake
with
one
hand
as
he
looked
at
nan
for
some
sign
of
recognition
which
was
quickly
given
you
shipped
under
better
masters
than
i
any
man
who
followed
the
sea
with
jack
prince
had
more
to
teach
than
to
learn
and
his
before
you
and
does
him
credit
too
said
captain
walter
anna
you
wo
find
many
of
your
grandfather
men
about
the
old
wharves
but
here
one
of
the
smartest
that
ever
had
hold
of
a
hawser
goodsoe
by
name
i
thank
ye
kindly
but
i
ai
much
account
nowadays
said
the
pleased
old
man
trying
to
get
the
startling
announcement
well
settled
in
his
mind
old
jack
prince
why
miss
nancy
never
been
brought
to
change
her
mind
about
nothing
has
she
it
seems
so
answered
nan
escort
laughing
as
if
this
were
a
good
joke
and
nan
herself
could
not
help
smiling
i
do
believe
if
the
old
gentleman
can
look
down
at
ye
he
begrudges
the
worst
of
his
voyages
nor
the
blackest
night
he
ever
spent
on
deck
if
you
going
to
have
the
spending
of
the
money
not
but
what
miss
prince
has
treated
me
handsome
right
straight
along
the
old
sailor
explained
while
the
inspector
thinking
this
not
a
safe
subject
to
continue
spoke
suddenly
about
some
fault
of
the
galley
and
after
this
was
discussed
the
eyes
of
the
two
practiced
men
sought
the
damaged
mizzen
mast
the
rigging
of
which
was
hanging
in
snarled
and
broken
lengths
when
nan
asked
for
some
account
of
the
accident
she
was
told
with
great
confidence
that
the
highflyer
had
been
fouled
and
that
it
was
the
other
vessel
fault
at
which
she
was
no
wiser
than
before
having
known
already
that
there
had
been
a
collision
there
seemed
to
be
room
enough
on
the
high
seas
she
ventured
to
say
or
might
the
mischief
have
been
done
in
port
it
does
seem
as
if
you
ought
to
know
the
sense
of
sea
talk
without
any
learning
being
jack
prince
said
old
goodsoe
for
captain
parish
had
removed
himself
to
a
little
distance
and
was
again
investigating
the
condition
of
the
ship
galley
which
one
might
suppose
to
have
been
neglected
in
some
unforgivable
way
judging
from
his
indignant
grumble
fouled
we
say
aboard
ship
when
two
vessels
lay
near
enough
so
that
they
drift
alongside
you
can
see
what
havick
would
make
for
ten
to
one
they
do
part
again
till
they
have
tore
each
other
all
to
shoestrings
the
yards
will
get
locked
together
and
the
same
wind
that
starts
one
craft
starts
both
and
first
one
and
then
lifts
with
a
wave
do
ye
see
and
the
rigging
spoilt
in
a
little
time
i
sometimes
called
it
to
mind
when
i
known
o
married
couples
that
was
getting
on
is
easy
to
drift
alongside
but
no
matter
if
they
was
bound
to
the
same
port
they
done
best
alone
and
the
old
fellow
shook
his
head
solemnly
and
was
evidently
selecting
one
of
his
numerous
stories
for
nan
edification
when
his
superior
officer
came
bustling
toward
them
you
might
as
well
step
down
here
about
four
i
shall
have
the
keys
then
i
may
want
you
to
hold
a
lantern
for
me
i
going
into
the
lower
hold
and
mean
to
do
my
work
thoroughly
if
i
do
it
at
all
to
which
goodsoe
responded
ay
ay
sir
in
most
seamanlike
fashion
and
hobbled
off
he
have
kept
you
there
all
day
whispered
captain
walter
he
always
loved
to
talk
and
now
he
has
nothing
else
to
do
but
we
are
all
friendly
to
goodsoe
some
of
us
pay
a
little
every
year
toward
his
support
but
he
has
always
made
himself
very
useful
about
the
wharves
until
this
last
year
or
two
he
thought
everything
of
your
grandfather
and
i
knew
it
would
please
him
to
speak
to
you
it
seems
unfortunate
that
you
should
have
grown
up
anywhere
else
than
here
but
i
hope
you
stay
now
it
is
not
very
likely
said
nan
coldly
she
wished
that
the
captain
would
go
on
with
his
stories
of
the
former
grandeur
of
dunport
rather
than
show
any
desire
to
talk
about
personal
matters
she
had
been
little
troubled
at
first
by
her
aunt
evident
disapproval
the
evening
before
of
her
plans
for
the
future
for
she
was
so
intent
upon
carrying
them
out
and
certain
that
no
one
had
any
right
to
interfere
still
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
been
violently
opposed
than
to
have
been
treated
like
a
child
whose
foolish
whim
would
soon
be
forgotten
when
anything
better
offered
itself
nan
felt
much
older
than
most
girls
of
her
years
and
as
if
her
decisions
were
quite
as
much
to
be
respected
as
her
aunt
she
had
dealt
already
with
graver
questions
than
most
persons
and
her
responsibilities
had
by
no
means
been
light
ones
she
felt
sometimes
as
if
she
were
separated
by
half
a
lifetime
from
the
narrow
limits
of
school
life
yet
there
was
an
uncommon
childlikeness
about
her
which
not
only
misled
these
new
friends
but
many
others
who
had
known
her
longer
and
when
these
listened
to
accounts
of
her
devotion
to
her
present
studies
and
her
marked
proficiency
they
shook
their
wise
heads
smilingly
as
if
they
knew
that
the
girl
was
innocent
of
certain
proper
and
insurmountable
obstacles
farther
on
the
air
was
fresh
and
it
was
so
pleasant
on
the
wharf
that
the
captain
paced
to
and
fro
several
times
while
he
pointed
out
different
objects
of
interest
along
the
and
tapped
the
rusty
anchor
and
the
hawsers
with
his
as
he
went
by
he
had
made
some
very
pointed
statements
to
the
keeper
wife
about
the
propriety
of
opening
the
hatches
on
such
a
morning
as
that
which
she
had
received
without
comment
and
wished
her
guests
with
provoking
equanimity
the
captain
did
not
like
to
have
his
authority
ignored
but
mentioned
placidly
that
he
supposed
every
idler
along
shore
had
been
giving
advice
though
he
wondered
what
nan
grandfather
and
old
captain
peterbeck
would
have
said
if
any
one
had
told
them
this
would
be
the
only
vessel
in
dunport
harbor
for
weeks
at
a
time
dear
me
he
exclaimed
again
presently
there
young
gerry
hard
at
work
and
he
directed
his
companion
attention
to
one
of
the
upper
windows
of
the
buildings
whose
fronts
had
two
stories
on
the
main
street
while
there
were
five
or
six
on
the
rear
which
faced
the
river
nan
could
see
the
diligent
young
man
and
thought
it
hard
that
any
one
must
be
drudging
within
doors
that
beautiful
morning
he
has
always
been
a
great
favorite
of
your
aunt
said
captain
parish
confidentially
after
the
law
student
had
pretended
to
suddenly
catch
sight
of
the
saunterers
and
waved
a
greeting
which
the
captain
exultantly
returned
we
have
always
thought
that
she
was
likely
to
make
him
her
heir
she
was
very
fond
of
his
father
you
see
and
some
trouble
came
between
them
nobody
ever
knew
because
if
anybody
ever
had
wit
enough
to
keep
her
own
counsel
was
nancy
prince
i
know
as
much
about
her
affairs
as
anybody
and
what
i
say
to
you
is
between
ourselves
i
know
just
how
far
to
sail
with
her
and
when
to
stop
if
i
do
want
to
get
wrecked
on
a
lee
shore
your
aunt
has
known
how
to
take
care
of
what
she
had
come
to
her
and
i
done
the
best
i
could
to
help
her
it
a
very
handsome
property
very
handsome
indeed
she
helped
george
gerry
to
get
his
education
and
then
he
had
some
little
money
left
him
by
his
father
brother
no
great
amount
but
enough
to
give
him
a
start
he
a
very
smart
upright
fellow
and
i
am
glad
for
whatever
nancy
did
for
him
but
it
did
seem
fair
that
he
should
be
stepping
into
your
rights
but
i
never
have
dared
to
speak
up
for
you
since
one
day
she
would
hear
a
word
about
it
that
all
i
have
to
remark
the
captain
concluded
in
a
hurry
for
wisdom
sake
though
he
longed
to
say
more
it
seemed
outrageous
to
him
at
this
moment
that
the
girl
at
his
side
should
have
been
left
among
strangers
and
he
was
thankful
that
she
seemed
at
last
to
have
a
good
chance
of
making
sure
of
her
rightful
possessions
but
i
have
needed
anything
she
said
giving
captain
walter
a
grateful
glance
for
his
championship
and
gerry
is
very
kind
and
attentive
to
my
aunt
so
i
am
glad
she
has
been
generous
to
him
he
seems
a
fine
fellow
as
you
say
and
nan
thought
suddenly
that
it
was
very
hard
for
him
to
have
had
her
appear
on
the
scene
by
way
of
rival
if
he
had
been
led
to
suppose
that
he
was
her
aunt
heir
there
were
so
many
new
things
to
think
of
that
nan
had
a
bewildering
sense
of
being
a
stranger
and
a
foreigner
in
this
curiously
dunport
and
a
most
disturbing
element
to
its
peace
of
mind
she
wondered
if
since
she
had
not
grown
up
here
it
would
not
have
been
better
to
have
stayed
away
altogether
her
own
life
had
always
been
quite
unvexed
by
any
sort
of
social
complications
and
she
thought
how
good
it
would
be
to
leave
this
talkative
and
staring
little
world
and
go
back
to
oldfields
and
its
familiar
interests
and
associations
but
dunport
was
a
dear
old
place
and
the
captain
a
most
entertaining
guide
and
by
the
time
their
walk
was
over
the
day
seemed
a
most
prosperous
and
entertaining
one
aunt
nancy
appeared
to
be
much
pleased
with
the
plan
for
the
afternoon
and
announced
that
she
had
asked
some
of
the
young
people
to
come
to
drink
tea
the
next
evening
while
she
greeted
nan
so
kindly
that
the
was
particularly
pleasant
as
for
the
captain
he
was
unmistakably
happy
and
went
off
down
the
street
with
a
gentle
rolling
gait
and
a
smile
upon
his
face
that
fairly
matched
the
june
weather
though
he
was
more
than
an
hour
late
for
the
little
refreshment
with
which
he
and
certain
dignified
associates
commonly
provided
themselves
at
eleven
in
the
forenoon
life
was
as
regular
ashore
as
on
board
ship
with
these
idle
mariners
of
high
degree
there
was
no
definite
business
among
them
except
that
of
occasionally
settling
an
estate
and
the
forming
of
decided
opinions
upon
important
questions
of
the
past
and
future
the
shadows
had
begun
to
grow
long
when
the
merry
company
of
young
people
went
up
river
with
the
tide
and
nan
thought
she
had
seldom
known
such
a
pleasure
away
from
her
own
home
she
begged
for
the
oars
and
kept
stroke
with
george
gerry
pulling
so
well
that
they
quickly
passed
the
other
boat
mary
parish
and
the
friend
who
made
the
fourth
of
that
division
of
the
party
sat
in
the
stern
and
steered
with
fine
dexterity
and
the
two
boats
kept
near
each
other
so
that
nan
soon
lost
all
feeling
of
strangeness
and
shared
in
the
good
comradeship
to
which
she
had
been
willingly
admitted
it
was
some
time
since
she
had
been
on
the
water
before
and
she
thought
more
than
once
of
her
paddling
about
the
river
in
her
childhood
and
even
regaled
the
company
once
with
a
most
amusing
mishap
at
the
remembrance
of
which
she
had
been
forced
to
laugh
outright
the
river
was
broad
and
brimful
of
water
it
seemed
high
tide
already
and
the
boats
pulled
easily
the
fields
sloped
down
to
the
shaded
with
elms
and
parted
by
hedgerows
like
a
bit
of
english
country
the
freshest
bloom
of
the
june
greenness
was
in
every
blade
of
grass
and
every
leaf
the
birds
were
beginning
to
sing
the
long
day
to
a
close
and
the
lowing
of
cattle
echoed
from
the
pastures
again
and
again
across
the
water
while
the
country
boats
were
going
home
from
the
town
sometimes
with
a
crew
of
women
who
seemed
to
have
made
this
their
regular
conveyance
instead
of
following
the
more
roundabout
highways
ashore
some
of
these
navigators
rowed
with
a
stroke
that
jerked
their
boats
along
in
a
droll
fashion
and
some
were
propelled
by
one
groping
oar
the
sculler
standing
at
the
stern
as
if
he
were
trying
to
push
his
craft
out
of
water
altogether
and
take
to
the
air
toward
which
the
lifted
bow
pointed
and
in
one
of
the
river
reaches
half
a
mile
ahead
two
heavy
packet
boats
with
lateen
sails
like
a
great
bird
single
wing
were
making
all
the
speed
they
could
toward
port
before
the
tide
should
begin
to
fall
two
hours
later
the
young
guest
of
the
party
was
very
happy
she
had
spent
so
many
of
her
childish
days
out
of
doors
that
a
return
to
such
pleasures
always
filled
her
with
strange
delight
the
color
was
bright
in
her
cheeks
and
her
girlishness
came
back
in
the
place
of
the
gravity
and
dignity
that
had
brought
of
late
a
sedate
young
womanliness
to
her
manner
the
two
new
friends
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
were
greatly
attracted
to
her
and
merry
laughter
rang
out
now
and
then
nan
was
so
brave
and
handsome
so
willing
to
be
pleased
and
so
grateful
to
them
for
this
little
festivity
that
they
quickly
became
interested
in
each
other
as
girls
will
the
commander
thought
himself
a
fortunate
fellow
and
took
every
chance
of
turning
his
head
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
our
heroine
though
he
always
had
a
good
excuse
of
taking
his
bearings
or
inspecting
for
himself
some
object
afloat
or
ashore
which
one
of
the
boat
company
had
pointed
out
and
nan
must
be
told
the
names
of
the
distant
hills
which
stood
out
clear
in
the
afternoon
light
and
to
what
towns
up
river
the
packet
boats
were
bound
and
so
the
time
seemed
short
before
the
light
dory
was
run
in
among
the
coarse
river
grass
and
pulled
up
higher
than
seemed
necessary
upon
the
shore
their
companions
had
not
chosen
so
fleet
a
craft
and
were
five
instead
of
four
at
any
rate
but
they
were
welcomed
somewhat
derisively
and
all
chattered
together
in
a
little
crowd
for
a
few
minutes
before
they
started
for
a
bit
of
woodland
which
overhung
the
river
on
a
high
point
the
wind
rustled
the
oak
leaves
and
roughened
the
surface
of
the
water
which
spread
out
into
a
wide
inland
bay
the
clouds
began
to
gather
in
the
west
and
to
take
on
wonderful
colors
as
if
such
a
day
must
be
ended
with
a
grand
ceremony
and
the
sun
go
down
through
banners
and
gay
parades
of
all
the
forces
of
the
sky
nan
had
watched
such
sunsets
from
her
favorite
playground
at
the
farm
and
somehow
the
memory
of
those
days
touched
her
heart
more
tenderly
than
they
had
ever
done
before
and
she
wished
for
a
moment
that
she
could
get
away
from
the
noisy
little
flock
who
were
busy
getting
the
supper
ready
though
they
said
eagerly
what
a
beautiful
evening
it
would
be
to
go
back
to
town
and
that
they
must
go
far
up
the
river
first
to
meet
the
moonlight
in
a
few
minutes
nan
heard
some
one
say
that
water
must
be
brought
from
a
not
far
away
and
quickly
insisted
that
she
should
make
one
of
the
messengers
and
after
much
discussion
and
remonstrance
she
and
young
gerry
found
themselves
crossing
the
open
field
together
the
girl
had
left
her
hat
swinging
from
one
of
the
low
oak
branches
she
wondered
why
mary
parish
had
looked
at
her
first
as
if
she
were
very
fond
of
her
and
then
almost
appealingly
until
the
remembrance
of
captain
walter
bit
of
gossip
came
to
mind
too
late
to
be
acted
upon
nan
felt
a
sudden
sympathy
and
was
sorry
she
had
not
thought
to
share
with
this
favorite
among
her
new
friends
the
companion
whom
she
had
joined
so
carelessly
george
gerry
had
some
very
attractive
ways
he
did
not
trouble
nan
with
unnecessary
attentions
as
some
young
men
had
and
she
told
herself
again
how
much
she
liked
him
they
walked
fast
with
free
light
steps
and
talked
as
they
went
in
a
way
that
was
very
pleasant
to
both
of
them
nan
was
wise
to
a
marvel
the
good
fellow
told
himself
and
yet
such
an
amusing
person
he
did
not
know
when
he
had
liked
anybody
so
much
he
was
very
glad
to
stand
well
in
the
sight
of
these
sweet
clear
eyes
and
could
not
help
telling
their
owner
some
of
the
things
that
lay
very
near
his
heart
he
had
wished
to
get
away
from
dunport
he
had
not
room
there
everybody
knew
him
as
well
as
they
knew
the
courthouse
he
somehow
wanted
to
get
to
deeper
water
and
out
of
his
depth
and
then
swim
for
it
with
the
rest
and
nan
listened
with
deep
sympathy
for
she
also
had
felt
that
a
great
engine
of
strength
and
ambition
was
at
work
with
her
in
her
plans
and
studies
she
waited
until
he
should
have
finished
his
confidence
to
say
a
word
from
her
own
experience
but
just
then
they
reached
the
and
stood
together
at
the
low
door
there
was
a
meagre
show
of
flowers
in
the
little
garden
which
the
dripping
eaves
had
beaten
and
troubled
in
the
late
rains
and
one
rosebush
was
loosely
caught
to
the
clapboards
here
and
there
there
did
not
seem
to
be
anybody
in
the
kitchen
into
which
they
could
look
through
the
open
doorway
though
they
could
hear
steps
and
voices
from
some
part
of
the
house
beyond
it
and
it
was
not
until
they
had
knocked
again
loudly
that
a
woman
came
to
answer
them
looking
worried
and
pale
i
never
was
so
glad
to
see
folks
though
i
do
know
who
you
be
she
said
hurriedly
i
believe
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
to
go
for
help
my
man
got
hurt
he
managed
to
get
home
but
he
broke
his
shoulder
or
any
ways
is
out
o
place
he
was
to
the
pasture
and
we
got
some
young
cattle
and
somehow
or
one
he
caught
and
was
meaning
to
lead
home
give
a
jump
and
john
lost
his
balance
he
says
he
ca
see
how
should
happened
but
over
he
went
and
got
jammed
against
a
rock
before
he
could
let
go
o
the
rope
he
put
round
the
critter
neck
he
in
dreadful
pain
so
i
could
leave
him
and
there
nobody
but
me
an
the
baby
you
have
to
go
to
the
next
house
and
ask
them
to
send
doctor
bent
always
attended
of
us
let
me
see
him
said
nan
with
decision
wait
a
minute
gerry
or
perhaps
you
had
better
come
in
too
and
she
led
the
way
while
the
surprised
young
man
and
the
mistress
of
the
house
followed
her
the
patient
was
a
strong
young
fellow
who
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
in
the
little
pale
as
ashes
and
holding
one
elbow
with
a
look
of
complete
misery
though
he
stopped
his
groans
as
the
strangers
came
in
lord
bless
you
young
man
do
wait
here
he
said
tell
the
doctor
it
may
only
be
out
o
place
but
i
feel
as
if
was
broke
but
nan
had
taken
a
pair
of
scissors
from
the
high
mantelpiece
and
was
making
a
cut
in
the
coarse
white
shirt
which
was
already
torn
and
stained
by
its
contact
with
the
ground
and
with
quick
fingers
and
a
look
of
deep
interest
made
herself
sure
what
had
happened
when
she
stood
still
for
a
minute
and
seemed
a
little
anxious
and
all
at
once
entirely
determined
just
lie
down
on
the
floor
a
minute
she
said
and
the
patient
with
some
exclamations
but
no
objections
obeyed
nan
pushed
the
spectators
into
the
doorway
of
the
kitchen
and
quickly
stooped
and
unbuttoned
her
right
boot
and
then
planted
her
foot
on
the
damaged
shoulder
and
caught
up
the
hand
and
gave
a
quick
pull
the
secret
of
which
nobody
understood
but
there
was
an
unpleasant
cluck
as
the
bone
went
back
into
its
socket
and
a
yell
from
the
sufferer
who
scrambled
to
his
feet
i
be
hanged
if
she
ai
set
it
he
said
looking
quite
weak
and
very
much
astonished
you
the
smartest
young
woman
i
ever
see
i
shall
have
to
lay
down
just
to
pull
my
wits
together
marthy
a
drink
of
water
and
by
the
time
this
was
brought
the
excitement
seemed
to
be
at
an
end
though
the
patient
was
a
little
faint
and
his
wife
looked
at
nan
admiringly
nan
herself
was
fastening
her
boot
again
with
unwonted
composure
george
gerry
had
not
a
word
to
say
and
listened
to
a
simple
direction
of
nan
as
if
it
were
meant
for
him
and
acceded
to
her
remark
that
she
was
glad
for
the
shoulder
sake
that
it
did
not
have
to
wait
and
grow
worse
and
worse
all
the
while
the
doctor
was
being
brought
from
town
and
after
a
few
minutes
when
the
volley
of
thanks
and
compliments
could
be
politely
cut
short
the
two
members
of
the
picnic
party
set
forth
with
their
pail
of
water
to
join
their
companions
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
how
you
knew
enough
to
do
that
asked
gerry
humbly
and
looking
at
his
companion
with
admiration
i
should
not
have
had
the
least
idea
i
was
very
glad
it
turned
out
so
well
said
nan
simply
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
be
of
use
they
were
so
frightened
poor
things
we
wo
say
anything
about
it
will
we
but
the
young
man
did
not
like
to
think
yet
of
the
noise
the
returning
bone
had
made
he
was
enough
usually
as
brave
a
fellow
as
one
could
wish
to
see
but
he
felt
weak
and
womanish
and
somehow
wished
it
had
been
he
who
could
play
the
doctor
nan
hurried
back
bareheaded
to
the
oak
grove
as
if
nothing
had
happened
though
if
possible
she
looked
gayer
and
brighter
than
ever
and
when
the
waiting
party
scolded
a
little
at
their
slow
pace
miss
prince
was
much
amused
and
made
two
or
three
laughing
apologies
for
their
laziness
and
even
ventured
to
give
the
information
that
they
had
made
a
pleasant
call
at
the
the
clouds
were
fading
fast
and
the
twilight
began
to
gather
under
the
trees
before
they
were
ready
to
go
away
and
then
the
high
tide
had
floated
off
one
of
the
boats
which
must
be
chased
and
brought
back
but
presently
the
picnickers
embarked
and
as
the
moon
came
up
and
the
river
ebbed
the
boats
went
back
to
the
town
and
overtook
others
on
the
way
and
then
were
pulled
up
stream
again
in
the
favoring
eddy
to
make
the
evening
pleasure
longer
at
last
nan
was
left
at
her
door
she
had
managed
that
george
gerry
should
give
mary
parish
his
arm
and
told
them
as
they
came
up
the
street
with
her
from
the
wharf
that
she
had
heard
their
voices
saturday
night
as
they
passed
under
her
window
it
was
mary
parish
herself
who
had
talked
about
the
best
room
and
its
ghosts
xviii
a
serious
it
was
very
good
for
nan
to
find
herself
cordially
welcomed
to
a
company
of
young
people
who
had
little
thought
of
anything
but
amusement
in
the
pleasant
summer
weather
other
young
guests
came
to
dunport
just
then
and
the
hospitable
town
seemed
to
give
itself
up
to
their
entertainment
picnics
and
followed
each
other
and
the
pleasure
boats
went
up
river
and
down
river
while
there
were
walks
and
rides
and
drives
and
all
manner
of
contrivances
and
excuses
for
spending
much
time
together
on
the
part
of
the
young
men
and
maidens
it
was
a
good
while
since
nan
had
taken
such
a
long
holiday
though
she
had
by
no
means
been
without
the
pleasures
of
society
not
only
had
she
made
friends
easily
during
her
and
her
later
studies
but
oldfields
itself
like
all
such
good
old
nests
was
apt
to
call
back
its
wandering
fledglings
when
the
june
weather
came
it
delighted
her
more
and
more
to
be
in
dunport
and
though
she
sometimes
grew
impatient
wise
leslie
insisted
that
she
must
not
hurry
home
the
change
was
the
very
best
thing
in
the
world
for
her
ferris
had
alighted
for
a
day
or
two
in
the
course
of
one
of
his
wandering
flights
and
it
seemed
to
the
girl
that
since
everything
was
getting
on
so
well
without
her
in
oldfields
she
had
better
as
the
doctor
had
already
expressed
it
let
her
visit
run
its
course
like
a
fever
at
any
rate
she
could
not
come
again
very
soon
and
since
her
aunt
seemed
so
happy
it
was
a
pity
to
hurry
away
and
end
these
days
sooner
than
need
be
it
had
been
a
charming
surprise
to
find
herself
such
a
desired
companion
and
again
and
again
quite
the
queen
of
that
little
court
of
frolickers
because
lately
she
had
felt
like
one
who
looks
on
at
such
things
and
can
not
make
part
of
them
yet
all
the
time
that
she
was
playing
she
thought
of
her
work
with
growing
satisfaction
by
other
people
the
knowledge
of
her
having
studied
medicine
was
not
very
well
received
it
was
considered
to
have
been
the
fault
of
miss
prince
who
should
not
have
allowed
a
whimsical
country
doctor
to
have
beguiled
the
girl
into
such
silly
notions
and
many
were
the
shafts
sped
toward
so
unwise
an
aunt
for
holding
out
against
her
niece
so
many
years
to
be
sure
the
child
had
been
placed
under
a
most
restricted
guardianship
but
years
ago
it
was
thought
the
matter
might
have
been
rearranged
and
nan
brought
to
dunport
it
certainly
had
been
much
better
for
her
that
she
had
grown
up
elsewhere
though
for
whatever
was
amiss
and
willful
in
her
ways
oldfields
was
held
accountable
it
must
be
confessed
that
every
one
who
had
known
her
well
had
discovered
sooner
or
later
the
untamed
wildnesses
which
seemed
like
the
tangles
which
one
often
sees
in
though
a
most
orderly
crop
is
taking
up
the
best
part
of
the
room
between
the
fences
yet
she
was
hard
to
find
fault
with
except
by
very
shortsighted
persons
who
resented
the
least
departure
by
others
from
the
code
they
themselves
had
been
pleased
to
authorize
and
who
could
not
understand
that
a
nature
like
nan
must
and
could
make
and
keep
certain
laws
of
its
own
there
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
inevitableness
about
the
visit
nan
herself
hardly
knew
why
she
was
drifting
on
day
after
day
without
reasonable
excuse
her
time
had
been
most
carefully
ordered
and
spent
during
the
last
few
years
and
now
she
sometimes
had
an
uneasy
feeling
and
a
lack
of
confidence
in
her
own
steadfastness
but
everybody
took
it
for
granted
that
the
visit
must
not
come
to
an
end
the
doctor
showed
no
sign
of
expecting
her
miss
prince
would
be
sure
to
resent
her
going
away
and
the
marked
one
day
after
another
for
their
own
it
seemed
impossible
and
perhaps
unwise
to
go
on
with
the
reading
she
had
planned
and
in
fact
she
had
been
urged
to
attend
to
her
books
rather
by
habit
than
natural
inclination
and
when
the
temptation
to
drift
with
the
stream
first
made
itself
felt
the
reasons
for
opposing
it
seemed
to
fade
away
it
was
easier
to
remember
that
leslie
and
even
those
teachers
who
knew
her
best
at
the
medical
school
had
advised
a
long
vacation
the
first
formal
visits
and
entertainments
were
over
with
for
the
most
part
and
many
of
the
dunport
acquaintances
began
to
seem
like
old
friends
there
had
been
a
little
joking
about
nan
profession
and
also
some
serious
remonstrance
and
unwise
championship
which
did
not
reach
this
heroine
ears
it
all
seemed
romantic
and
most
unusual
when
anybody
talked
about
her
story
at
all
and
the
conclusion
was
soon
reached
that
all
such
whims
and
extravagances
were
merely
incident
to
the
existence
and
that
now
the
young
guest
had
come
to
her
own
the
responsibilities
and
larger
field
of
activity
would
have
their
influence
over
her
plan
of
life
the
girl
herself
was
disposed
to
talk
very
little
about
this
singular
fancy
it
may
have
been
thought
that
she
had
grown
ashamed
of
it
as
seen
by
a
brighter
light
but
the
truth
was
it
kept
a
place
too
near
her
heart
to
allow
her
to
gossip
with
people
who
had
no
real
sympathy
and
who
would
ask
questions
from
curiosity
alone
miss
eunice
fraley
had
taken
more
than
one
opportunity
however
to
confess
her
interest
though
she
did
this
with
the
manner
of
one
who
dares
to
be
a
conspirator
against
public
opinion
and
possibly
the
permanent
welfare
of
society
and
had
avowed
beside
her
own
horror
of
a
doctor
simplest
duties
but
poor
miss
fraley
looked
at
her
young
friend
as
a
caged
bird
at
a
window
might
watch
a
lark
flight
and
was
strangely
glad
whenever
there
was
a
chance
to
spend
an
hour
in
nan
company
the
first
evening
at
fraley
had
been
a
great
success
and
miss
prince
had
been
vastly
pleased
because
both
the
hostess
and
the
guest
had
received
each
other
commendation
fraley
was
perhaps
the
one
person
whom
miss
prince
recognized
as
a
superior
officer
and
she
observed
nan
unconscious
and
suitable
good
behavior
with
great
pride
the
hostess
had
formerly
been
an
undisputed
ruler
of
the
highest
social
circles
of
dunport
society
and
now
in
her
old
age
when
she
could
no
longer
be
present
at
any
public
occasions
she
was
still
the
queen
of
a
little
court
that
assembled
in
her
own
house
it
was
true
that
the
list
of
her
subjects
grew
shorter
year
by
year
but
the
survivors
remained
loyal
and
hardly
expected
or
even
desired
that
any
of
the
newcomers
to
the
town
should
recognize
their
ruler
nan
had
been
much
interested
in
the
old
lady
stories
and
had
gladly
accepted
an
invitation
to
come
often
to
renew
the
first
conversation
she
was
able
to
give
fraley
much
welcome
information
of
the
ways
and
fashions
of
other
centres
of
civilization
and
it
was
a
good
thing
to
make
the
hours
seem
shorter
the
poor
old
lady
had
few
alleviations
even
religion
had
served
her
rather
as
a
basis
for
argument
than
an
accepted
reliance
and
guide
and
though
she
still
prided
herself
on
her
selection
of
words
those
which
she
used
in
formal
conversations
with
the
clergyman
seemed
more
empty
and
meaningless
than
most
others
fraley
was
leaving
this
world
reluctantly
she
had
been
well
fitted
by
nature
for
social
preeminence
and
had
never
been
half
satisfied
with
the
opportunities
provided
for
the
exercise
of
her
powers
it
was
only
lately
that
she
had
been
forced
to
acknowledge
that
time
showed
signs
of
defeating
her
in
the
projects
of
her
life
and
she
had
begun
to
give
up
the
fight
altogether
and
to
mourn
bitterly
and
aggressively
to
her
anxious
and
resourceless
daughter
it
was
plain
enough
that
the
dissatisfactions
and
infirmities
of
age
were
more
than
usually
great
and
poor
eunice
was
only
too
glad
when
the
younger
miss
prince
proved
herself
capable
of
interesting
the
old
friend
of
her
family
and
fraley
took
heart
and
suggested
both
informal
visits
and
future
entertainments
the
prudent
daughter
was
careful
not
to
tell
her
mother
of
the
revolutionary
ideas
and
for
a
time
all
went
well
until
some
unwise
person
unaware
of
miss
fraley
warning
gestures
from
the
other
side
of
the
proceeded
to
give
a
totally
unnecessary
opinion
of
the
propriety
of
women
studying
medicine
poor
eunice
expected
that
a
sharp
rebuke
followed
by
a
day
or
two
disdain
and
general
unpleasantness
would
descend
upon
her
quaking
shoulders
but
to
her
surprise
nothing
was
said
until
the
next
morning
when
she
was
bidden
at
much
inconvenience
to
the
household
to
invite
miss
prince
and
her
niece
to
come
that
afternoon
to
drink
tea
quite
informally
there
was
a
pathetic
look
in
the
messenger
faded
face
she
felt
unusually
at
odds
with
fortune
as
she
glided
along
the
street
sheltered
by
the
narrow
shadows
of
the
high
fences
nan
herself
came
to
the
door
and
when
she
threw
back
the
closed
blinds
and
discovered
the
visitor
she
drew
her
in
with
most
cordial
welcome
and
the
two
friends
entered
the
darkened
south
parlor
where
it
was
cool
and
sweet
with
the
fragrance
of
some
honeysuckle
which
nan
had
brought
in
early
that
morning
from
the
garden
dear
me
said
the
little
woman
deprecatingly
i
do
know
why
i
came
in
at
all
i
ca
stop
to
make
a
call
mother
was
very
desirous
that
you
and
your
aunt
should
come
over
to
tea
this
evening
it
seems
a
good
deal
to
ask
in
such
hot
weather
but
she
has
so
little
to
amuse
her
and
i
really
do
see
that
the
weather
makes
much
difference
she
used
to
feel
the
heat
very
much
years
ago
and
miss
eunice
gave
a
sigh
and
fanned
herself
slowly
letting
the
fan
which
had
been
put
into
her
hand
turn
itself
quite
over
on
her
lap
before
it
came
up
again
there
was
an
air
of
antique
elegance
about
this
which
amused
nan
who
stood
by
the
table
wiping
with
her
handkerchief
some
water
that
had
dropped
from
the
vase
a
great
many
of
the
ladies
in
church
the
sunday
before
had
fanned
themselves
in
this
same
little
languishing
way
she
remembered
one
or
two
funny
old
persons
in
oldfields
who
gave
themselves
airs
after
the
same
fashion
i
think
we
shall
both
be
very
pleased
she
answered
directly
with
a
bit
of
a
smile
while
miss
fraley
gazed
at
her
admiringly
and
thought
she
had
never
seen
the
girl
look
so
fresh
and
fair
as
she
did
in
this
plain
cool
little
dress
there
had
been
more
water
than
was
at
first
suspected
the
handkerchief
was
a
limp
white
handful
and
they
both
laughed
as
it
was
held
up
miss
fraley
insisted
that
she
could
not
stay
she
must
go
to
the
shops
to
do
some
errands
and
hoped
to
meet
miss
prince
who
had
gone
that
way
half
an
hour
before
do
mind
anything
mother
may
say
to
you
she
entreated
after
lingering
a
minute
and
looking
imploringly
in
nan
face
you
know
we
ca
expect
a
person
of
her
age
to
look
at
everything
just
as
we
do
am
i
to
be
scolded
asked
nan
serenely
do
you
know
what
it
is
about
oh
perhaps
nothing
answered
miss
fraley
quickly
i
ought
not
to
have
spoken
only
i
fancied
she
was
a
little
distressed
at
the
idea
of
your
being
interested
in
medicines
i
do
know
anything
that
is
more
useful
myself
i
am
sure
every
family
needs
to
have
some
one
who
has
some
knowledge
of
such
things
it
saves
calling
a
doctor
my
sister
susan
knows
more
than
any
of
us
and
it
has
been
very
useful
to
her
with
her
large
family
but
i
should
be
afraid
to
come
i
think
said
nan
laughing
fraley
told
me
that
she
would
finish
that
story
of
the
diamond
ring
you
know
and
we
shall
get
on
capitally
really
i
think
her
stories
of
old
times
are
wonderfully
interesting
i
wish
i
had
a
gift
for
writing
them
down
whenever
i
am
listening
to
her
miss
eunice
was
much
relieved
and
felt
sure
that
nan
was
equal
to
any
emergency
the
girl
had
put
a
strong
young
arm
quickly
round
her
guest
thin
shoulders
and
had
kissed
her
affectionately
and
this
had
touched
the
lonely
little
woman
very
heart
there
were
signs
of
storm
in
madam
fraley
face
that
evening
but
everybody
feigned
not
to
observe
them
and
nan
behaved
with
perilous
disregard
of
a
lack
of
encouragement
and
made
herself
and
the
company
uncommonly
merry
she
described
the
bad
effect
her
coming
had
had
upon
her
aunt
orderly
house
she
confessed
to
having
left
her
own
possessions
in
such
confusion
the
evening
before
when
she
dressed
again
to
go
up
the
river
that
priscilla
had
called
it
a
wedding
and
had
gone
away
after
one
scornful
look
inside
the
door
miss
fraley
dared
to
say
that
no
one
could
mind
seeing
such
pretty
things
and
even
miss
prince
mentioned
that
her
niece
was
not
so
careless
as
she
would
make
them
believe
while
nan
begged
to
know
if
anybody
had
ever
heard
of
a
monkey
wedding
before
and
seemed
very
much
amused
she
called
such
a
disarray
in
the
kitchen
one
morning
the
wedding
breakfast
said
miss
prince
as
if
she
never
had
thought
it
particularly
amusing
until
this
minute
priscilla
has
always
made
use
of
a
great
many
expressions
they
had
seated
themselves
at
the
it
was
evident
that
miss
fraley
had
found
it
a
hard
day
for
she
looked
tired
and
worn
the
mistress
of
the
house
was
dressed
in
her
best
and
most
imposing
clothes
and
sat
solemnly
in
her
place
a
careful
observer
might
have
seen
that
the
best
blue
teacups
with
their
scalloped
edges
were
not
set
forth
the
occasion
wore
the
air
of
a
tribunal
rather
than
that
of
a
festival
and
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
a
difference
between
it
and
the
former
miss
prince
was
not
particularly
sensitive
to
moods
and
atmospheres
she
happened
to
be
in
very
good
spirits
and
talked
for
some
time
before
she
became
entirely
aware
that
something
had
gone
wrong
but
presently
faltered
and
fell
under
the
ban
looking
questioningly
toward
poor
eunice
who
busied
herself
with
the
nancy
said
fraley
impatiently
i
was
amazed
to
find
that
there
is
a
story
going
about
town
that
your
niece
here
is
studying
to
be
a
doctor
i
hope
that
you
do
countenance
any
such
nonsense
miss
prince
looked
helpless
and
confounded
and
turned
her
eyes
toward
her
niece
she
could
only
hope
at
such
a
mortifying
juncture
that
nan
was
ready
to
explain
or
at
least
to
shoulder
the
responsibility
indeed
she
does
give
me
any
encouragement
fraley
said
nan
fearlessly
only
this
morning
she
saw
a
work
on
ventilation
in
my
room
and
told
me
it
was
proper
reading
for
a
young
woman
i
really
did
look
at
the
title
said
miss
prince
smiling
in
spite
of
herself
it
does
seem
to
improve
the
health
of
you
young
folks
because
you
think
it
necessary
to
become
familiar
with
such
subjects
announced
the
irate
old
lady
it
was
her
habit
to
take
a
very
slight
refreshment
at
the
usual
tea
hour
and
supplement
it
by
a
substantial
lunch
at
and
so
now
she
was
not
only
at
leisure
herself
but
demanded
the
attention
of
her
guests
she
had
evidently
prepared
an
opinion
and
was
determined
to
give
it
miss
eunice
grew
smaller
and
thinner
than
ever
and
fairly
shivered
with
shame
behind
the
she
looked
steadily
at
the
big
as
if
she
were
thinking
whether
she
might
creep
into
it
and
pull
something
over
her
head
she
never
liked
an
argument
even
if
it
were
a
one
and
always
had
a
vague
sense
of
personal
guilt
and
danger
in
my
time
fraley
continued
it
was
thought
proper
for
young
women
to
show
an
interest
in
household
affairs
when
i
was
married
it
was
not
asked
whether
i
was
acquainted
with
but
i
do
think
there
is
any
need
of
that
replied
nan
i
think
such
things
are
the
duty
of
professional
men
and
women
only
i
am
very
far
from
believing
that
every
girl
ought
to
be
a
surgeon
any
more
than
that
she
ought
to
be
an
astronomer
and
as
for
the
younger
being
less
strong
than
the
old
i
am
afraid
it
is
their
own
fault
since
we
understand
the
laws
of
health
better
than
we
used
breaks
pays
you
know
it
was
evidently
not
expected
that
the
young
guest
should
venture
to
discuss
the
question
but
rather
have
accepted
her
rebuke
meekly
and
acknowledged
herself
in
the
wrong
but
she
had
the
courage
of
her
opinions
and
the
eagerness
of
youth
and
could
hardly
bear
to
be
so
easily
defeated
so
when
fraley
mistaking
the
moment
silence
for
a
final
triumph
said
again
that
a
woman
place
was
at
home
and
that
a
woman
was
out
of
place
and
unwelcome
everywhere
the
girl
cheeks
flushed
suddenly
i
think
it
is
a
pity
that
we
have
fallen
into
a
habit
of
using
as
a
term
of
rebuke
she
said
i
am
willing
to
acknowledge
that
people
who
are
eager
for
reforms
are
apt
to
develop
unpleasant
traits
but
it
is
only
because
they
have
to
fight
against
opposition
and
ignorance
when
they
are
dead
and
the
world
is
reaping
the
reward
of
their
bravery
and
constancy
it
no
longer
laughs
but
makes
statues
of
them
and
praises
diem
and
thanks
them
in
every
way
it
can
i
think
we
ought
to
judge
each
other
by
the
highest
standards
fraley
and
by
whether
we
are
doing
good
work
my
day
is
past
said
the
hostess
i
do
not
belong
to
the
present
and
i
suppose
my
judgment
is
worth
nothing
to
you
and
nan
looked
up
quickly
and
affectionately
i
should
like
to
have
all
my
friends
believe
that
i
am
doing
right
she
said
i
do
feel
very
certain
that
we
must
educate
people
properly
if
we
want
them
to
be
worth
anything
it
is
no
use
to
treat
all
the
boys
and
girls
as
if
nature
had
meant
them
for
the
same
business
and
scholarship
and
try
to
put
them
through
the
same
drill
for
that
is
sure
to
mislead
and
confuse
all
those
who
are
not
perfectly
sure
of
what
they
want
there
are
plenty
of
people
dragging
themselves
miserably
through
the
world
because
they
are
clogged
and
fettered
with
work
for
which
they
have
no
fitness
i
know
i
have
had
the
experience
that
you
have
fraley
but
i
ca
help
believing
that
nothing
is
better
than
to
find
one
work
early
and
hold
fast
to
it
and
put
all
one
heart
into
it
i
have
done
my
best
to
serve
god
in
the
station
to
which
it
has
pleased
him
to
call
me
said
fraley
stiffly
i
believe
that
a
young
man
position
is
very
different
from
a
girl
to
be
sure
i
can
give
my
opinion
that
everything
went
better
when
the
master
workmen
took
apprentices
to
their
trades
and
there
was
so
much
schooling
but
i
warn
you
my
dear
that
your
notion
about
studying
to
be
a
doctor
has
shocked
me
very
much
indeed
i
could
not
believe
my
ears
a
refined
girl
who
bears
an
honorable
and
respected
name
to
think
of
being
a
woman
doctor
if
you
were
five
years
older
you
would
never
have
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
it
lowers
the
pride
of
all
who
have
any
affection
for
you
if
it
were
not
that
your
early
life
had
been
somewhat
peculiar
and
most
unfortunate
i
should
blame
you
more
as
it
is
i
can
but
wonder
at
the
lack
of
judgment
in
others
i
shall
look
forward
in
spite
of
it
all
to
seeing
you
happily
married
to
which
miss
prince
assented
with
several
decided
nods
this
is
why
i
made
up
my
mind
to
be
a
physician
said
the
culprit
and
though
she
had
been
looking
down
and
growing
more
uncomfortable
every
moment
she
suddenly
gave
her
head
a
quick
upward
movement
and
looked
at
fraley
frankly
with
a
beautiful
light
in
her
clear
eyes
i
believe
that
god
has
given
me
a
fitness
for
it
and
that
i
never
could
do
anything
else
half
so
well
nobody
persuaded
me
into
following
such
a
plan
i
simply
grew
toward
it
and
i
have
everything
to
learn
and
a
great
many
faults
to
overcome
but
i
am
trying
to
get
on
as
fast
as
may
be
i
ca
be
too
glad
that
i
have
spent
my
childhood
in
a
way
that
has
helped
me
to
use
my
gift
instead
of
hindering
it
but
everything
helps
a
young
man
to
follow
his
bent
he
has
an
honored
place
in
society
and
just
because
he
is
a
student
of
one
of
the
learned
professions
he
ranks
above
the
men
who
follow
other
pursuits
i
do
see
why
it
should
be
a
shame
and
dishonor
to
a
girl
who
is
trying
to
do
the
same
thing
and
to
be
of
equal
use
in
the
world
god
would
not
give
us
the
same
talents
if
what
were
right
for
men
were
wrong
for
women
my
dear
it
is
quite
unnatural
you
see
said
the
antagonist
impatiently
here
you
are
less
than
years
old
and
i
shall
hear
of
your
being
married
next
thing
at
least
i
hope
i
shall
and
you
will
laugh
at
all
this
nonsense
a
woman
place
is
at
home
of
course
i
know
that
there
have
been
some
women
physicians
who
have
attained
eminence
and
some
artists
and
all
that
but
i
would
rather
see
a
daughter
of
mine
take
a
more
retired
place
the
best
service
to
the
public
can
be
done
by
keeping
one
own
house
in
order
and
one
husband
comfortable
and
by
attending
to
those
social
responsibilities
which
come
in
our
way
the
mothers
of
the
nation
have
rights
enough
and
duties
enough
already
and
need
not
look
farther
than
their
own
firesides
or
wish
for
the
plaudits
of
an
ignorant
public
but
if
i
do
not
wish
to
be
married
and
do
not
think
it
right
that
i
should
be
said
poor
nan
at
last
if
i
have
good
reasons
against
all
that
would
you
have
me
bury
the
talent
god
has
given
me
and
choke
down
the
wish
that
makes
itself
a
prayer
every
morning
that
i
may
do
this
work
lovingly
and
well
it
is
the
best
way
i
can
see
of
making
myself
useful
in
the
world
people
must
have
good
health
or
they
will
fail
of
reaching
what
success
and
happiness
are
possible
for
them
and
so
many
persons
might
be
better
and
stronger
than
they
are
now
which
would
make
their
lives
very
different
i
do
think
if
i
can
help
my
neighbors
in
this
way
it
will
be
a
great
kindness
i
wo
attempt
to
say
that
the
study
of
medicine
is
a
proper
vocation
for
women
only
that
i
believe
more
and
more
every
year
that
it
is
the
proper
study
for
me
it
certainly
can
not
be
the
proper
vocation
of
all
women
to
bring
up
children
so
many
of
them
are
dead
failures
at
it
and
i
do
see
why
all
girls
should
be
thought
failures
who
do
not
marry
i
do
believe
that
half
those
who
do
marry
have
any
real
right
to
it
at
least
until
people
use
common
sense
as
much
in
that
most
important
decision
as
in
lesser
ones
of
course
we
ca
expect
to
bring
about
an
ideal
state
of
society
all
at
once
but
just
because
we
really
believe
in
having
the
best
possible
conditions
we
make
no
effort
at
all
toward
even
better
ones
people
ought
to
work
with
the
great
laws
of
nature
and
not
against
them
you
do
know
anything
about
it
said
fraley
who
hardly
knew
what
to
think
of
this
ready
opposition
you
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
anna
you
have
neither
age
nor
experience
and
it
is
easy
to
see
you
have
been
associating
with
very
foolish
people
i
am
the
last
person
to
say
that
every
marriage
is
a
lucky
one
but
if
you
were
my
daughter
i
should
never
consent
to
your
injuring
your
chances
for
happiness
in
this
way
nan
could
not
help
stealing
a
glance
at
poor
miss
eunice
behind
her
fragile
battlement
of
the
and
was
deeply
touched
at
the
glance
of
sympathy
which
dimly
flickered
in
the
lonely
eyes
i
do
think
mother
that
anna
is
right
about
single
women
having
some
occupation
was
timidly
suggested
of
course
i
mean
those
who
have
no
special
home
duties
i
can
see
that
life
would
not
now
eunice
interrupted
the
commander
in
chief
i
do
wish
you
could
keep
an
opinion
of
your
own
you
are
the
last
person
to
take
up
with
such
ideas
i
have
no
patience
with
people
who
do
know
their
own
minds
half
an
hour
together
there
are
plenty
of
foolish
women
who
marry
i
acknowledge
said
miss
prince
for
the
sake
of
coming
to
the
rescue
i
was
really
angry
yesterday
when
gerry
told
me
that
everybody
was
so
pleased
to
hear
that
hattie
barlow
was
engaged
because
she
was
incapable
of
doing
anything
to
support
herself
i
could
help
feeling
that
if
there
was
so
little
power
that
it
had
never
visibly
turned
itself
in
any
practical
direction
she
was
likely
to
be
a
good
housekeeper
i
think
that
is
a
most
responsible
situation
myself
nan
looked
up
gratefully
it
is
so
much
that
people
ca
do
anything
as
that
they
try
to
do
the
wrong
things
aunt
nancy
we
all
are
busy
enough
or
ought
to
be
only
the
richest
people
have
the
most
cares
and
have
to
work
hardest
i
used
to
think
that
rich
city
people
did
nothing
but
amuse
themselves
when
i
was
a
little
girl
but
i
often
wonder
nowadays
at
the
wisdom
and
talent
that
are
needed
to
keep
a
high
social
position
respected
in
the
world
eyes
it
must
be
an
orderly
and
really
woman
who
can
keep
her
business
from
getting
into
a
most
melancholy
tangle
yet
nobody
is
afraid
when
the
most
foolish
girls
take
such
duties
upon
themselves
and
all
the
world
cries
out
with
fear
of
disaster
if
once
in
a
while
one
makes
up
her
mind
to
some
other
plan
of
life
of
course
i
know
being
married
a
trade
it
is
a
natural
condition
of
life
which
permits
a
man
to
follow
certain
public
careers
and
forbids
them
to
a
woman
and
since
i
have
not
wished
to
be
married
and
have
wished
to
study
medicine
i
do
see
what
act
of
parliament
can
punish
me
wait
until
mr
right
comes
along
said
fraley
who
had
pushed
back
her
chair
from
the
table
and
was
beating
her
foot
on
the
floor
in
a
way
that
betokened
great
displeasure
and
impatience
i
am
only
thankful
i
had
my
day
when
women
were
content
to
be
stayers
at
home
i
am
only
speaking
for
your
good
and
you
live
to
see
the
truth
of
it
poor
child
i
am
sure
she
will
get
over
this
apologized
miss
prince
after
they
had
reached
the
parlor
for
she
found
that
her
niece
had
lingered
with
miss
fraley
in
the
do
talk
to
me
about
the
princes
changing
their
minds
answered
the
scornful
old
hostess
you
ought
to
know
them
better
than
that
by
this
time
but
just
at
that
moment
young
gerry
came
tapping
at
the
door
and
the
two
ladies
quickly
softened
their
excited
looks
and
welcomed
him
as
the
most
powerful
argument
for
their
side
of
the
debate
it
seemed
quite
a
thing
of
the
past
that
he
should
have
fancied
mary
parish
and
more
than
one
whisper
had
been
listened
to
that
the
young
man
was
likely
to
have
the
prince
inheritance
after
all
he
looked
uncommonly
well
that
evening
and
the
elder
women
could
not
imagine
that
any
damsel
of
his
own
age
would
consider
him
slightingly
nan
had
given
a
little
shrug
of
impatience
when
she
heard
his
voice
join
the
weaker
ones
in
the
parlor
and
a
sense
of
discomfort
that
she
never
had
felt
before
came
over
her
suddenly
she
reminded
herself
that
she
must
tell
her
aunt
that
very
night
that
the
visit
must
come
to
an
end
she
had
neglected
her
books
and
her
drives
with
the
doctor
altogether
too
long
already
xix
friend
and
lover
in
these
summer
days
the
young
lawyer
thoughts
had
often
been
busy
elsewhere
while
he
sat
at
the
shaded
office
window
and
looked
out
upon
the
river
the
very
housekeeping
on
the
damaged
ship
became
more
interesting
to
him
than
his
law
books
and
he
watched
the
wife
at
her
various
employments
on
deck
or
grew
excited
as
he
witnessed
the
good
woman
encounters
with
marauding
small
boys
who
prowled
about
hoping
for
chances
of
climbing
the
rigging
or
solving
the
mysteries
of
the
hold
it
had
come
to
be
an
uncommon
event
that
a
vessel
should
make
the
harbor
of
dunport
and
the
elder
citizens
ignored
the
deserted
wharves
and
talked
proudly
of
the
days
of
dunport
prosperity
convicting
the
railroad
of
its
decline
as
much
as
was
consistent
with
their
possession
of
profitable
stock
the
younger
people
took
the
empty
warehouses
for
granted
and
listened
to
their
grandparents
stories
with
interest
if
they
did
not
hear
them
too
often
and
the
more
enterprising
among
them
spread
their
wings
of
ambition
and
flew
away
to
the
larger
cities
or
to
the
westward
george
gerry
had
stayed
behind
reluctantly
he
had
neither
enough
desire
for
a
more
active
life
nor
so
high
a
purpose
that
he
could
disregard
whatever
opposition
lay
in
his
way
yet
he
was
honestly
dissatisfied
with
his
surroundings
and
thought
himself
hardly
used
by
a
hindering
fate
he
believed
himself
to
be
most
anxious
to
get
away
yet
he
was
like
a
ship
which
will
not
be
started
out
of
port
by
anything
less
than
a
hurricane
there
really
were
excuses
for
his
staying
at
home
and
since
he
had
stopped
to
listen
to
them
they
beguiled
him
more
and
more
and
his
friends
one
by
one
commended
his
devotion
to
his
mother
and
sisters
and
sometimes
forgot
to
sympathize
with
him
for
his
disappointments
as
they
praised
him
for
being
such
a
dutiful
son
to
be
sure
he
might
be
a
great
lawyer
in
dunport
as
well
as
anywhere
else
he
would
not
be
the
first
but
a
more
inspiring
life
might
have
made
him
more
enthusiastic
and
energetic
and
if
he
could
have
been
winning
his
way
faster
elsewhere
and
sending
home
good
accounts
of
himself
not
to
speak
of
substantial
aid
there
is
no
question
whether
it
would
not
have
given
his
family
greater
happiness
and
done
himself
more
good
he
was
not
possessed
of
the
stern
determination
which
wins
its
way
at
all
hazards
and
so
was
dependent
upon
his
surroundings
for
an
occasional
stimulus
but
dunport
was
very
grateful
to
him
because
he
had
stayed
at
home
and
he
was
altogether
the
most
prominent
young
man
in
the
town
it
is
so
easy
to
be
thankful
that
one
friends
are
no
worse
that
one
sometimes
forgets
to
remember
that
they
might
be
better
and
it
would
have
been
only
natural
if
he
thought
of
himself
more
highly
than
he
ought
to
think
since
he
had
received
a
good
deal
of
applause
and
admiration
it
is
true
that
he
had
avoided
vice
more
noticeably
than
he
had
pursued
virtue
but
the
senior
member
of
the
firm
mr
sergeant
pronounced
his
young
partner
to
have
been
a
most
excellent
student
and
not
only
showed
the
greatest
possible
confidence
in
him
but
was
transferring
a
good
deal
of
the
business
to
him
already
miss
prince
and
her
old
lawyer
had
one
secret
which
had
never
been
suspected
and
the
townspeople
thought
more
than
ever
of
young
gerry
ability
when
it
was
known
that
the
most
distinguished
legal
authority
of
that
region
had
given
him
a
share
of
a
long
established
business
george
gerry
had
been
led
to
think
better
of
himself
though
it
had
caused
him
no
little
wonder
when
the
proposal
had
been
made
it
was
possible
that
mr
sergeant
feared
that
there
might
be
some
alliance
offered
by
his
rivals
in
dunport
to
be
sure
the
younger
firm
had
been
making
a
good
deal
of
money
but
it
was
less
respected
by
the
leading
business
men
mr
sergeant
had
even
conferred
with
his
young
friend
one
morning
upon
the
propriety
of
some
new
investments
but
gerry
had
never
even
suspected
that
they
were
the
price
of
his
own
new
dignity
and
claim
upon
the
public
honor
captain
walter
parish
and
mr
sergeant
had
both
been
aids
and
advisers
of
miss
prince
but
neither
had
ever
known
the
condition
of
all
her
financial
affairs
and
she
had
made
the
most
of
a
comfortable
sense
of
liberty
to
do
young
gerry
justice
he
had
not
hesitated
to
express
his
amazement
and
among
his
elders
and
betters
at
any
rate
he
had
laid
his
good
fortune
at
the
door
of
mr
sergeant
generosity
and
kindness
instead
of
his
own
value
but
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
like
this
there
was
no
excitement
in
the
office
and
after
an
attendance
at
court
and
the
proper
adjustment
whether
temporary
or
permanent
of
the
subsequent
business
the
partners
had
returned
to
a
humdrum
fulfilling
of
the
minor
duties
of
their
profession
and
the
younger
man
worked
at
his
law
books
when
there
were
no
deeds
or
affidavits
to
engage
his
attention
he
thought
of
many
things
as
he
sat
by
his
window
it
was
a
great
relief
to
the
tiresomeness
of
the
dull
rooms
to
look
at
the
river
and
at
the
shores
and
hills
beyond
to
notice
carelessly
whether
the
tide
came
in
or
went
out
he
was
apt
to
feel
a
sense
of
dissatisfaction
in
his
leisure
moments
and
now
a
new
current
was
bringing
all
its
force
to
bear
upon
him
in
his
quiet
anchorage
he
had
looked
upon
miss
prince
as
a
kind
adviser
he
was
on
more
intimate
terms
with
her
than
with
any
woman
he
knew
and
the
finer
traits
in
his
character
were
always
brought
out
by
some
compelling
force
in
her
dignity
and
simple
adherence
to
her
somewhat
narrow
code
of
morals
and
etiquette
he
was
grateful
to
her
for
many
kindnesses
and
as
he
had
grown
older
and
come
to
perceive
the
sentiment
which
had
been
the
first
motive
of
her
affection
toward
him
he
had
instinctively
responded
with
a
mingling
of
gallantry
and
sympathy
which
made
him
as
has
been
already
said
appear
at
his
very
best
the
gossips
of
dunport
had
whispered
that
he
knew
that
it
was
more
than
worth
his
while
to
be
polite
to
miss
prince
but
he
was
too
manly
a
fellow
to
allow
any
trace
of
subserviency
to
show
itself
in
his
conduct
as
often
happens
he
had
come
back
to
dunport
almost
a
stranger
after
his
years
of
college
life
were
over
and
he
had
a
mingled
love
and
impatience
for
the
old
place
the
last
year
had
been
very
pleasant
however
there
were
a
few
young
men
whose
good
comrade
and
leader
he
was
his
relations
with
his
were
most
harmonious
and
as
for
the
girls
of
his
own
age
and
their
younger
sisters
who
were
just
growing
up
he
was
immensely
popular
and
admired
by
them
it
had
become
a
subject
of
much
discussion
whether
he
and
mary
parish
would
not
presently
decide
upon
becoming
engaged
to
each
other
until
miss
prince
niece
came
to
put
a
new
suspicion
into
everybody
mind
many
times
when
george
gerry
had
a
new
proof
that
he
had
somehow
fallen
into
the
habit
of
walking
home
with
the
pleasant
girl
who
was
his
friend
and
neighbor
he
had
told
himself
abruptly
that
there
was
no
danger
in
it
and
that
they
never
could
have
any
other
feeling
for
each
other
but
he
had
begun
to
think
also
that
she
belonged
to
him
in
some
vague
way
and
sometimes
acknowledged
that
it
might
be
a
thing
to
consider
more
deeply
by
and
by
he
was
only
and
the
world
was
still
before
him
but
he
was
not
very
sympathetic
with
other
people
enthusiasm
over
their
love
affairs
and
wondered
if
it
were
not
largely
a
matter
of
temperament
though
by
and
by
he
should
like
to
have
a
home
of
his
own
he
was
somewhat
attracted
toward
miss
prince
the
younger
for
her
aunt
sake
and
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
be
very
attentive
to
her
no
matter
how
displeasing
and
uninteresting
she
might
be
it
was
sure
to
be
a
time
of
trial
to
his
old
friend
and
he
would
help
all
he
could
to
make
the
visit
as
bearable
as
possible
everybody
knew
of
the
niece
existence
who
had
known
the
prince
family
at
all
and
though
miss
prince
had
never
mentioned
the
unhappy
fact
until
the
day
or
two
before
her
guest
was
expected
her
young
cavalier
had
behaved
with
most
excellent
discretion
and
feigning
neither
surprise
nor
dismay
accepted
the
announcement
in
a
way
that
had
endeared
him
still
more
to
his
patroness
but
on
the
first
sunday
morning
when
a
most
admirable
young
lady
had
walked
up
the
broad
aisle
of
ann
church
and
gerry
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
between
the
rows
of
heads
which
all
looked
commonplace
by
contrast
it
seemed
to
begin
a
new
era
of
things
this
was
a
welcome
link
with
the
busier
world
outside
dunport
this
was
what
he
had
missed
since
he
had
ended
his
college
days
a
gleam
of
cosmopolitan
sunshine
which
made
the
provincial
fog
less
attractive
than
ever
he
was
anxious
to
claim
companionship
with
this
fair
citizen
of
a
larger
world
and
to
disclaim
any
idea
of
belonging
to
the
humdrum
little
circle
which
exaggerated
its
own
importance
he
persuaded
himself
that
he
must
pay
miss
prince
guest
an
early
visit
it
was
very
exciting
and
interesting
altogether
and
as
he
watched
the
flicker
of
light
in
our
heroine
hair
as
she
sat
on
the
straight
sofa
in
her
aunt
parlor
on
the
sunday
evening
a
feeling
of
great
delight
stole
over
him
he
had
known
many
nice
girls
in
his
lifetime
but
there
was
something
uncommonly
interesting
about
miss
anna
prince
besides
who
could
help
being
grateful
to
her
for
being
so
much
nicer
than
anybody
had
expected
and
so
the
days
went
by
nobody
thought
there
was
any
objection
when
the
junior
partner
of
the
law
firm
took
holiday
after
holiday
for
there
was
little
business
and
mr
sergeant
liked
to
keep
on
with
his
familiar
routine
his
old
friends
came
to
call
frequently
and
they
had
their
conferences
in
peace
and
were
not
inclined
to
object
if
the
younger
ears
were
being
used
elsewhere
young
people
will
be
young
people
and
june
weather
does
not
always
last
and
if
george
gerry
were
more
devoted
to
social
duties
than
to
legal
ones
it
was
quite
natural
and
he
had
just
acquitted
himself
most
honorably
at
the
may
term
of
court
and
was
his
own
master
if
he
decided
to
take
a
vacation
he
had
been
amused
when
the
announcement
had
been
made
so
early
in
their
acquaintance
that
nan
meant
to
study
medicine
he
believed
if
there
were
any
fault
it
was
leslie
and
only
thought
it
a
pity
that
her
evident
practical
talents
had
not
been
under
the
guidance
of
a
more
sensible
director
the
girl
impetuous
defense
of
her
choice
was
very
charming
he
had
often
heard
mr
sergeant
speak
of
the
rare
insight
and
understanding
of
legal
matters
which
his
favorite
daughter
had
possessed
and
her
early
death
had
left
a
lonely
place
in
the
good
man
heart
miss
prince
life
at
oldfields
must
have
been
very
dull
especially
since
her
days
were
over
for
himself
he
had
a
great
prejudice
against
the
usurpation
of
men
duties
and
prerogatives
by
women
and
had
spoken
of
all
such
assumptions
with
contempt
it
made
a
difference
that
this
attractive
young
student
had
spoken
bravely
on
the
wrong
side
but
if
he
had
thought
much
about
it
he
would
have
made
himself
surer
and
surer
that
only
time
was
needed
to
show
her
the
mistake
if
he
had
gone
deeper
into
the
subject
he
would
have
said
that
he
thought
it
all
nonsense
about
women
having
the
worst
of
it
in
life
he
had
known
more
than
one
good
fellow
who
had
begun
to
go
down
hill
from
the
day
he
was
married
and
if
girls
would
only
take
the
trouble
to
fit
themselves
for
their
indoor
business
the
world
would
be
a
vastly
more
comfortable
place
and
as
for
their
tinkering
at
the
laws
such
projects
should
be
bitterly
resented
it
only
needed
a
few
days
to
make
it
plain
to
this
good
fellow
that
the
coming
of
one
of
the
summer
guests
had
made
a
great
difference
in
his
life
it
was
easy
to
find
a
hundred
excuses
for
going
to
miss
prince
who
smiled
benignantly
upon
his
evident
interest
in
the
fair
stranger
within
her
gates
the
truth
must
be
confessed
however
that
the
episode
of
the
lamed
shoulder
at
the
picnic
party
had
given
george
gerry
great
unhappiness
there
was
something
so
high
and
serene
in
anna
prince
simplicity
and
directness
and
in
the
way
in
which
she
had
proved
herself
adequate
to
so
unusual
an
occasion
that
he
could
not
help
mingling
a
good
deal
of
admiration
with
his
dissatisfaction
it
is
in
human
nature
to
respect
power
but
all
his
manliness
was
at
stake
and
his
natural
rights
would
be
degraded
and
lost
if
he
could
not
show
his
power
to
be
greater
than
her
own
and
as
the
days
went
by
every
one
made
him
more
certain
that
he
longed
more
than
he
had
ever
longed
for
anything
before
to
win
her
love
his
heart
had
never
before
been
deeply
touched
but
life
seemed
now
like
a
heap
of
dry
wood
which
had
only
waited
for
a
live
coal
to
make
it
flame
and
leap
in
mysterious
light
and
transfigure
itself
from
dullness
into
a
bewildering
and
unaccountable
glory
it
was
no
wonder
any
longer
that
poets
had
sung
best
of
love
and
its
joys
and
sorrows
and
that
men
and
women
since
the
world
began
had
followed
at
its
call
all
life
and
its
history
was
explained
anew
yet
this
eager
lover
felt
himself
to
be
the
first
discoverer
of
the
world
great
secret
it
was
hard
to
wait
and
to
lack
assurance
but
while
the
hours
when
he
had
the
ideal
and
the
dream
seemed
to
make
him
certain
he
had
only
to
go
back
to
miss
prince
to
become
doubtful
and
miserable
again
the
world
did
not
consent
to
second
his
haste
and
the
persons
most
concerned
in
his
affairs
were
stupidly
slow
at
understanding
the
true
state
of
them
while
every
day
made
the
prize
look
more
desirable
every
day
seemed
to
put
another
barrier
between
himself
and
nan
and
when
she
spoke
of
her
visit
end
it
was
amazing
to
him
that
she
should
not
understand
his
misery
he
wondered
at
himself
more
and
more
because
he
seemed
to
have
the
power
of
behaving
much
as
usual
when
he
was
with
his
friends
it
seemed
impossible
that
he
could
always
go
on
without
betraying
his
thoughts
there
was
no
question
of
any
final
opposition
to
his
suit
it
seemed
to
him
he
could
not
be
more
sure
than
he
was
already
of
miss
prince
willingness
to
let
him
plead
his
cause
with
her
niece
so
many
vexed
questions
would
be
pleasantly
answered
and
he
ventured
to
hope
that
the
girl
herself
would
be
glad
to
spend
her
life
in
dear
old
dunport
where
her
father
people
had
been
honored
for
so
many
years
the
good
leslie
must
be
fast
growing
old
and
though
he
would
miss
his
adopted
child
it
was
reasonable
that
he
should
be
glad
to
see
her
happily
anchored
in
a
home
of
her
own
before
he
died
if
nan
were
friendless
and
penniless
it
would
make
no
difference
but
nevertheless
for
her
sake
it
was
good
to
remember
that
some
one
had
said
that
leslie
unlike
most
physicians
was
a
man
of
fortune
and
nothing
remained
but
to
win
an
affection
which
should
match
his
own
and
this
impatient
suitor
walked
and
drove
and
spent
the
fleeting
hours
in
waiting
for
a
chance
to
show
himself
in
the
lists
of
love
it
seemed
years
instead
of
weeks
at
last
and
yet
as
if
he
had
only
been
truly
alive
and
free
since
love
had
made
him
captive
he
could
not
fasten
himself
down
to
his
work
without
great
difficulty
though
he
built
many
a
castle
in
spain
with
his
imagined
wealth
and
laid
deep
plans
of
study
and
acquirement
which
should
be
made
evident
as
time
went
on
all
things
seemed
within
his
reach
in
these
first
days
of
his
enlightenment
it
had
been
like
the
rising
of
the
sun
which
showed
him
a
new
world
of
which
he
was
lawful
master
but
the
minor
events
of
his
blissful
existence
began
to
conspire
against
him
in
a
provoking
way
and
presently
it
was
sadly
forced
upon
his
understanding
that
anna
prince
was
either
unconscious
or
disdainful
of
his
affection
it
could
hardly
be
the
latter
for
she
was
always
friendly
and
hospitable
and
took
his
courtesies
in
such
an
unsuspecting
and
grateful
way
there
was
something
so
about
her
and
so
independent
of
any
one
protection
that
this
was
the
most
discouraging
thing
of
all
for
his
own
instinct
was
that
of
standing
between
her
and
all
harm
of
making
himself
responsible
for
her
shelter
and
happiness
she
seemed
to
get
on
capitally
well
without
him
but
after
all
he
could
not
help
being
conqueror
in
so
just
and
inevitable
a
war
the
old
proverb
suddenly
changed
from
a
pebble
to
a
diamond
and
he
thanked
the
philosopher
more
than
once
who
had
first
reminded
the
world
that
faint
heart
won
fair
lady
presently
he
grew
sad
as
lovers
will
and
became
paler
and
less
vigorous
and
made
his
friends
wonder
a
good
deal
until
they
at
last
suspected
his
sweet
sorrow
and
ranged
themselves
in
eager
ranks
upon
his
side
with
all
history
and
tradition
in
their
favor
nan
herself
was
not
among
the
first
to
suspect
that
one
of
her
new
friends
had
proved
to
be
a
lover
she
had
been
turned
away
from
such
suspicions
by
her
very
nature
and
when
she
had
been
forced
to
believe
in
one
or
two
other
instances
that
she
was
unwillingly
drawing
to
herself
the
devotion
which
most
women
unconsciously
seek
she
had
been
made
most
uncomfortable
and
had
repelled
all
possibility
of
its
further
progress
she
had
believed
herself
proof
against
such
assailment
and
so
indeed
she
had
been
but
on
the
very
evening
of
her
battle
for
her
opinions
at
fraley
she
had
been
suddenly
confronted
by
a
new
enemy
a
strange
power
which
seemed
so
dangerous
that
she
was
at
first
overwhelmed
by
a
sense
of
her
own
defenselessness
she
had
waited
with
miss
fraley
who
was
not
quite
ready
to
leave
the
with
the
rest
and
had
been
much
touched
by
her
confidence
poor
eunice
had
been
very
fond
of
one
of
her
who
had
afterward
entered
the
navy
and
who
had
been
fond
of
her
in
return
but
as
everybody
had
opposed
the
match
for
her
sake
and
had
placed
little
reliance
in
the
young
man
she
had
meekly
given
up
all
hope
of
being
his
wife
and
he
had
died
of
yellow
fever
at
key
west
soon
after
we
were
not
even
engaged
you
know
dear
whispered
the
little
lady
but
somehow
i
have
always
felt
in
my
heart
that
i
belonged
to
him
though
i
believe
every
word
you
said
about
a
girl
having
an
independence
of
her
own
it
is
a
great
blessing
to
have
always
had
such
a
person
as
my
mother
to
lean
upon
but
i
should
be
quite
helpless
if
she
were
taken
away
of
course
i
have
had
what
i
needed
and
what
we
could
afford
she
went
on
after
another
pause
but
i
never
can
get
over
hating
to
ask
for
money
i
do
sometimes
envy
the
women
who
earn
what
they
spend
nan
eyes
flashed
i
think
it
is
only
fair
that
even
those
who
have
to
spend
their
husband
or
their
father
money
should
be
made
to
feel
it
is
their
own
if
one
does
absolutely
nothing
in
one
home
and
is
not
even
able
to
give
pleasure
then
i
think
it
is
stealing
i
have
felt
so
strongly
about
that
since
i
have
grown
up
for
you
know
leslie
my
guardian
has
done
everything
for
me
aunt
nancy
gave
me
money
every
year
but
i
never
spent
any
of
it
until
i
went
away
to
school
and
then
i
insisted
upon
taking
that
and
what
my
grandmother
left
me
but
my
later
studies
have
more
than
used
it
all
leslie
is
so
kind
to
me
like
an
own
father
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
my
life
with
him
most
eagerly
after
the
next
year
or
two
i
shall
be
at
home
all
the
time
and
i
am
so
glad
to
think
i
can
really
help
him
and
that
we
are
interested
in
the
same
things
miss
eunice
was
a
little
incredulous
though
she
did
not
dare
to
say
so
in
the
first
place
she
could
not
be
persuaded
that
a
woman
could
possibly
know
as
much
about
diseases
and
their
remedies
as
a
man
and
she
wondered
if
even
the
rural
inhabitants
of
oldfields
would
cheerfully
accept
the
change
from
their
trusted
physician
to
his
young
ward
no
matter
what
sails
of
diplomas
she
might
spread
to
the
breeze
but
nan
perfect
faith
and
confidence
were
not
to
be
lightly
disputed
and
if
the
practice
of
medicine
by
women
could
be
made
honorable
it
certainly
was
in
able
hands
here
as
far
as
an
admiring
friend
could
decide
nan
was
anything
but
and
she
had
no
noisy
fashion
of
thrusting
herself
before
the
public
gaze
but
everybody
trusted
her
who
knew
her
she
had
the
rare
and
noble
faculty
of
inspiring
confidence
there
was
no
excuse
for
a
longer
absence
from
the
parlor
where
fraley
was
throned
in
state
in
her
chair
and
was
already
calling
the
loiterers
she
and
miss
prince
were
smiling
indulgently
upon
the
impatient
young
man
who
was
describing
to
them
a
meeting
of
the
stockholders
of
the
turnpike
company
of
which
he
had
last
year
been
made
secretary
a
dividend
had
been
declared
and
it
was
larger
than
had
been
expected
and
the
ladies
were
as
grateful
as
if
he
had
furnished
the
means
from
his
own
pocket
he
looked
very
tall
and
handsome
and
as
he
rose
to
salute
miss
fraley
and
nan
and
presently
told
his
real
errand
he
apologized
for
interfering
with
the
little
festival
but
two
or
three
of
the
young
people
had
suddenly
made
a
plan
for
going
to
see
a
play
which
was
to
be
given
that
night
in
the
town
hall
by
a
traveling
company
would
miss
anna
prince
care
to
go
and
miss
fraley
nan
hardly
knew
why
she
at
once
refused
and
was
filled
with
regret
when
she
saw
a
look
of
childish
expectancy
on
miss
eunice
face
quickly
change
to
disappointment
it
is
too
hot
to
shut
one
self
into
that
close
place
i
am
afraid
she
said
and
i
am
enjoying
myself
very
much
here
mr
gerry
which
was
generous
on
nan
part
if
one
considered
the
premeditated
war
which
had
been
waged
against
her
then
the
thought
flashed
through
her
mind
that
it
might
be
a
bit
of
good
fun
for
her
companion
and
without
waiting
for
either
approval
or
opposition
from
the
elder
women
she
said
in
a
different
tone
however
if
miss
fraley
will
go
too
i
will
accept
with
pleasure
i
suppose
it
is
quite
time
and
before
there
could
be
a
formal
dissent
she
had
hurried
the
pleased
daughter
of
the
house
who
was
not
quick
in
her
movements
to
her
room
and
in
a
few
minutes
after
a
good
deal
of
laughter
which
the
presence
of
the
escort
kept
anybody
from
even
wishing
to
silence
the
three
were
fairly
started
down
the
street
it
was
of
no
avail
that
fraley
condemned
her
own
judgment
in
not
having
advised
eunice
to
stay
at
home
and
leave
the
young
people
free
and
that
miss
prince
made
a
feeble
protest
for
politeness
sake
the
could
not
be
called
back
nan
had
really
grown
into
a
great
liking
for
george
gerry
she
often
thought
it
would
have
been
very
good
to
have
such
a
brother
but
more
than
one
person
in
the
audience
thought
they
had
never
seen
a
braver
young
couple
and
the
few
elderly
persons
of
discretion
who
had
gone
to
the
play
felt
their
hearts
thrill
with
sudden
sympathy
as
our
friends
went
far
down
the
room
to
their
seats
miss
fraley
was
almost
girlish
herself
and
looked
so
pleased
and
bright
that
everybody
who
cared
anything
about
her
smiled
when
they
caught
sight
of
her
she
was
so
prim
and
neat
it
was
impossible
for
her
under
any
circumstances
to
look
anything
but
discreet
and
quaint
but
as
for
nan
she
was
beautiful
with
youth
and
health
as
simply
dressed
as
miss
eunice
but
with
the
gayety
of
a
flower
some
slender
wild
thing
that
has
sprung
up
fearlessly
under
the
great
sky
with
only
the
sunshine
and
the
wind
and
summer
rain
to
teach
it
and
help
it
fulfill
its
destiny
a
flower
that
has
grown
with
no
painful
effort
of
its
own
but
because
god
made
it
and
kept
it
that
has
bloomed
because
it
has
come
in
the
course
of
its
growth
to
the
right
time
and
miss
eunice
like
a
hindered
little
took
a
long
breath
of
delight
as
she
sat
close
by
her
kind
young
friend
and
felt
as
if
somebody
had
set
her
roots
free
from
their
familiar
prison
to
let
god
make
us
instead
of
painfully
trying
to
make
ourselves
to
follow
the
path
that
his
love
shows
us
instead
of
through
conceit
or
cowardice
or
mockery
choosing
another
to
trust
him
for
our
strength
and
fitness
as
the
flowers
do
simply
giving
ourselves
back
to
him
in
grateful
service
this
is
to
keep
the
laws
that
give
us
the
freedom
of
the
city
in
which
there
is
no
longer
any
night
of
bewilderment
or
ignorance
or
uncertainty
so
the
woman
who
had
lived
a
life
of
bondage
whose
hardest
was
herself
and
the
woman
who
had
been
both
taught
and
inspired
to
hold
fast
her
freedom
sat
side
by
side
the
one
life
having
been
blighted
because
it
lacked
its
mate
and
was
but
half
a
life
in
itself
while
the
other
fearing
to
give
half
its
royalty
or
to
share
its
bounty
was
being
tempted
to
cripple
itself
and
to
lose
its
strait
and
narrow
way
where
god
had
left
no
room
for
another
for
as
the
play
went
on
and
the
easily
pleased
audience
laughed
and
clapped
its
hands
and
the
tired
players
bowed
and
smiled
from
behind
the
flaring
there
was
one
spectator
who
was
conscious
of
a
great
crisis
in
her
own
life
which
the
mimicry
of
that
evening
seemed
to
ridicule
and
counterfeit
and
though
nan
smiled
with
the
rest
and
even
talked
with
her
neighbors
while
the
tawdry
curtain
had
fallen
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
coming
of
death
at
her
life
end
could
not
be
more
strange
and
sudden
than
this
great
barrier
which
had
fallen
between
her
and
her
girlhood
the
dear
old
life
which
had
kept
her
so
unpuzzled
and
safe
so
this
was
love
at
last
this
fear
this
change
this
strange
relation
to
another
soul
who
could
stand
now
at
her
right
hand
and
give
her
grace
to
hold
fast
the
truth
that
her
soul
must
ever
be
her
own
the
only
desire
that
possessed
her
was
to
be
alone
again
to
make
love
show
his
face
as
well
as
make
his
mysterious
presence
felt
she
was
thankful
for
the
shelter
of
the
crowd
and
went
on
wishing
that
the
short
distance
to
her
aunt
home
could
be
made
even
shorter
she
had
felt
this
man
love
for
her
only
in
a
vague
way
before
and
now
as
he
turned
to
speak
to
her
from
time
to
time
she
could
not
meet
his
eyes
the
groups
of
people
bade
each
other
merrily
though
the
entertainment
had
been
a
little
tiresome
to
every
one
at
the
last
and
it
seemed
the
briefest
space
of
time
before
miss
fraley
and
nan
and
their
cavalier
were
left
by
themselves
and
at
last
nan
and
george
gerry
were
alone
together
for
his
part
he
had
never
been
so
happy
as
that
night
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
wish
was
coming
true
and
he
spoke
gently
enough
and
of
the
same
things
they
might
have
talked
about
the
night
before
but
a
splendid
chorus
of
victory
was
sounding
in
his
ears
and
once
as
they
stopped
for
a
moment
to
look
between
two
of
the
old
warehouses
at
the
shining
river
and
the
masts
and
rigging
of
the
ship
against
the
moonlighted
sky
he
was
just
ready
to
speak
to
the
girl
at
his
side
but
he
looked
at
her
first
and
then
was
silent
there
was
something
in
her
face
that
forbade
it
a
whiteness
and
a
strange
look
in
her
eyes
that
made
him
lose
all
feeling
of
comradeship
or
even
acquaintance
i
wonder
if
the
old
highflyer
will
ever
go
out
again
she
said
slowly
captain
parish
told
me
some
time
ago
that
he
had
found
her
more
badly
damaged
than
he
supposed
a
vessel
like
that
belongs
to
the
high
seas
and
is
like
a
prisoner
when
it
touches
shore
i
believe
that
the
stray
souls
that
have
no
bodies
must
sometimes
make
a
dwelling
in
inanimate
things
and
make
us
think
they
are
alive
i
am
always
sorry
for
that
ship
its
guardian
angel
must
have
been
asleep
the
night
of
the
collision
laughed
young
gerry
uneasily
he
was
displeased
with
himself
the
moment
afterward
but
nan
laughed
too
and
felt
a
sense
of
reprieve
and
they
went
on
again
and
said
good
night
quietly
on
the
steps
of
the
old
prince
house
it
was
very
late
for
dunport
and
the
door
was
shut
but
through
the
panes
of
glass
overhead
a
faint
light
was
shining
though
it
could
hardly
assert
itself
against
the
moonlight
miss
prince
was
still
and
her
niece
upbraided
her
and
then
began
to
give
an
account
of
the
play
which
was
cut
short
by
the
mistress
of
the
house
for
after
one
eager
long
look
at
nan
she
became
sleepy
and
disappointed
and
they
said
but
the
girl
felt
certain
that
her
aunt
was
leagued
against
her
and
grew
sick
at
heart
and
tired
as
she
climbed
the
stairs
there
was
a
letter
on
the
long
mahogany
table
in
the
hall
and
nan
stopped
and
looked
over
the
railing
at
it
wearily
miss
prince
stopped
too
and
said
she
was
sorry
she
had
forgotten
it
was
from
oldfields
and
in
writing
but
though
nan
went
back
for
it
and
kissed
it
more
than
once
before
she
went
to
bed
and
even
put
it
under
her
pillow
as
a
comfort
and
defense
against
she
knew
not
what
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
was
afraid
to
open
it
and
read
the
kind
words
that
night
she
watched
the
moonlight
creep
along
the
floor
and
heard
the
cocks
crow
at
midnight
and
in
the
morning
the
birds
woke
with
the
new
day
while
she
tried
to
understand
the
day
that
had
gone
wondering
what
she
must
do
and
say
when
she
faced
the
world
again
only
a
few
hours
later
sometimes
she
felt
herself
carried
along
upon
a
rushing
tide
and
was
amazed
that
a
hundred
gifts
and
conditions
to
which
she
had
scarcely
given
a
thought
seemed
dear
and
necessary
once
she
fancied
herself
in
a
quiet
home
living
there
perhaps
in
that
very
house
and
being
pleased
with
her
ordering
and
and
her
great
profession
was
all
like
a
fading
dream
it
seemed
now
no
matter
whether
she
had
ever
loved
the
studies
of
it
or
been
glad
to
think
that
she
had
it
in
her
power
to
make
suffering
less
or
prevent
it
altogether
her
old
ambitions
were
torn
away
from
her
one
by
one
and
in
their
place
came
the
satisfactions
of
love
and
marriage
and
and
housekeeping
the
dear
womanly
sheltered
fashions
of
life
toward
which
she
had
been
thankful
to
see
her
friends
go
hand
in
hand
making
themselves
a
complete
happiness
which
nothing
else
could
match
but
as
the
night
waned
the
certainty
of
her
duty
grew
clearer
and
clearer
she
had
long
ago
made
up
her
mind
that
she
must
not
marry
she
might
be
happy
it
was
true
and
make
other
people
so
but
her
duty
was
not
this
and
a
certainty
that
satisfaction
and
the
blessing
of
god
would
not
follow
her
into
these
reverenced
and
honored
limits
came
to
her
distinctly
one
by
one
the
reasons
for
keeping
on
her
chosen
course
grew
more
unanswerable
than
ever
she
had
not
thought
she
should
be
called
to
resist
this
temptation
but
since
it
had
come
she
was
glad
she
was
strong
enough
to
meet
it
it
would
be
no
real
love
for
another
person
and
no
justice
to
herself
to
give
up
her
work
even
though
holding
it
fast
would
bring
weariness
and
pain
and
reproach
and
the
loss
of
many
things
that
other
women
held
dearest
and
best
in
the
morning
nan
smiled
when
her
aunt
noticed
her
tired
look
and
said
that
the
play
had
been
a
pursuit
of
pleasure
under
difficulties
and
though
miss
prince
looked
up
in
dismay
and
was
full
of
objections
and
almost
querulous
reproaches
because
nan
said
she
must
end
her
visit
within
a
day
or
two
she
hoped
that
george
gerry
would
be
after
all
a
reason
for
the
girl
staying
until
nan
who
had
been
standing
by
the
window
looking
wistfully
at
the
garden
suddenly
turned
and
said
gently
and
solemnly
listen
aunt
nancy
i
must
be
about
my
business
you
do
not
know
what
it
means
to
me
or
what
i
hope
to
make
it
mean
to
other
people
and
then
miss
prince
knew
once
for
all
that
it
was
useless
to
hope
or
to
plan
any
longer
but
she
would
not
let
herself
be
vanquished
so
easily
and
summoned
to
her
mind
many
assurances
that
girls
would
not
be
too
easily
won
and
after
a
short
season
of
disapproving
silence
returned
to
her
usual
manner
as
if
there
had
been
neither
difference
nor
dispute
xx
ashore
and
afloat
your
cousin
walter
parish
is
coming
to
dine
with
us
said
miss
prince
later
that
morning
he
came
to
the
fraleys
just
after
you
went
out
last
evening
to
speak
with
me
about
a
business
matter
and
waited
to
walk
home
with
me
afterward
i
have
been
meaning
to
invite
him
here
with
his
wife
but
there
does
seem
to
be
much
prospect
of
her
leaving
her
room
for
some
time
yet
and
this
morning
i
happened
to
find
an
uncommonly
good
pair
of
young
ducks
old
brown
has
kept
my
liking
for
them
in
mind
for
a
great
many
years
your
grandfather
used
to
say
that
there
was
nothing
like
a
duckling
to
his
taste
he
used
to
eat
them
in
england
but
people
in
this
country
let
them
get
too
old
he
was
willing
to
pay
a
great
price
for
ducklings
always
but
even
brown
seems
to
think
it
is
a
great
wrong
not
to
let
them
grow
until
thanksgiving
time
and
makes
a
great
many
apologies
every
year
it
is
from
his
farm
that
we
always
get
the
best
lamb
too
they
are
very
nice
people
the
browns
but
the
poor
old
man
seems
very
feeble
this
summer
some
day
i
should
really
like
to
take
a
drive
out
into
the
country
to
see
them
you
know
so
well
how
to
manage
a
horse
you
can
spare
a
day
or
two
to
give
time
for
that
ca
you
nan
was
sorry
to
hear
the
pleading
tone
it
was
so
unlike
her
usually
severe
manner
and
answered
quickly
that
she
should
be
very
glad
to
make
the
little
excursion
brown
had
asked
her
to
come
to
the
farm
one
day
near
the
beginning
of
her
visit
you
must
say
this
is
home
if
you
can
said
miss
prince
who
was
a
good
deal
excited
and
shaken
that
morning
and
not
think
of
yourself
as
a
visitor
any
more
there
are
a
great
many
things
i
hope
you
can
understand
even
if
i
have
left
them
unsaid
it
has
really
seemed
more
like
home
since
you
have
been
here
and
less
like
a
lodging
i
wonder
how
i
when
did
you
see
brown
i
did
not
know
you
had
ever
spoken
to
him
it
was
some
time
ago
the
girl
answered
i
was
in
the
kitchen
and
he
came
to
the
door
he
seemed
very
glad
to
see
me
and
nan
hesitated
a
moment
he
said
i
was
like
my
father
yes
indeed
responded
miss
prince
drearily
and
the
thought
seized
her
that
it
was
very
strange
that
the
same
mistaken
persistency
should
show
itself
in
father
and
child
in
exactly
opposite
ways
if
nan
would
only
care
as
much
for
marrying
george
gerry
as
her
father
had
for
marrying
his
wretched
wife
it
seemed
more
and
more
impossible
that
this
little
lady
should
be
the
daughter
of
such
a
woman
how
dismayed
the
girl
would
be
if
she
could
be
shown
her
mother
nature
as
miss
prince
remembered
it
alas
this
was
already
a
sorrow
which
no
vision
of
the
reality
could
deepen
and
the
frank
words
of
the
oldfields
country
people
about
the
bad
thachers
had
not
been
spoken
fruitlessly
in
the
ears
of
their
last
descendant
i
am
so
glad
the
captain
is
coming
nan
said
presently
to
break
the
painful
silence
i
do
hope
that
he
and
leslie
will
know
each
other
some
time
they
would
be
such
capital
friends
the
doctor
sent
his
kind
regards
to
you
in
last
night
letter
and
asked
me
again
to
say
that
he
hoped
that
you
would
come
to
us
before
the
summer
is
over
i
should
like
so
much
to
have
you
know
what
oldfields
is
like
it
was
hard
to
save
herself
from
saying
home
again
instead
of
oldfields
but
the
change
of
words
was
made
quickly
he
is
very
courteous
and
hospitable
but
i
never
pay
visits
nowadays
said
miss
prince
and
thought
almost
angrily
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
her
making
a
target
of
herself
for
all
those
curious
eyes
and
then
they
rose
and
separated
for
a
time
each
being
burdened
less
by
care
than
thought
the
captain
came
early
to
dine
and
brought
with
him
his
own
and
miss
prince
letters
from
the
together
with
the
morning
paper
which
he
proceeded
to
read
he
also
seemed
to
have
a
weight
upon
his
mind
but
by
the
time
they
were
at
table
a
mild
cheerfulness
made
itself
felt
and
nan
summoned
all
her
resources
and
was
gayer
and
brighter
than
usual
miss
prince
had
gone
down
town
early
in
the
day
and
her
niece
was
perfectly
sure
that
there
had
been
a
consultation
with
gerry
he
had
passed
the
house
while
nan
sat
at
her
upper
window
writing
and
had
looked
somewhat
wistfully
at
the
door
as
if
he
had
half
a
mind
to
enter
it
he
was
like
a
great
magnet
it
seemed
impossible
to
resist
looking
after
him
and
indeed
his
presence
would
not
forsake
her
mind
but
seemed
urging
her
toward
his
visible
self
the
thought
of
him
was
so
powerful
that
the
sight
of
the
young
man
was
less
strange
and
compelling
and
it
was
almost
a
relief
to
have
seen
his
familiar
appearance
the
strong
figure
in
its
clothes
his
vigor
and
easy
step
as
he
went
by
she
liked
him
still
but
she
hated
love
it
was
making
her
so
miserable
even
when
later
she
told
captain
parish
some
delightful
oldfields
stories
of
so
humorous
a
kind
that
he
laughed
long
and
struck
the
table
more
than
once
which
set
the
glasses
jingling
and
gave
a
splendid
approval
to
the
fun
the
ducklings
were
amazingly
good
and
when
captain
walter
had
tasted
his
wine
and
read
the
silver
label
on
the
decanter
which
as
usual
gave
no
evidence
of
the
rank
and
dignity
of
the
contents
his
eyes
sparkled
with
satisfaction
and
he
turned
to
his
cousin
daughter
with
impressive
gravity
you
may
never
have
tasted
such
wine
as
that
he
said
your
grandfather
the
luckiest
captain
who
ever
sailed
out
of
dunport
brought
it
home
fifty
years
ago
and
it
was
well
ripened
then
i
did
know
there
was
a
bottle
of
it
left
nancy
he
laughed
my
dear
your
aunt
has
undertaken
to
pay
one
of
us
a
handsome
compliment
your
health
cousin
walter
said
the
girl
quickly
lifting
her
own
glass
and
making
him
a
little
bow
over
the
old
madeira
bless
your
dear
heart
responded
the
captain
the
same
good
wishes
to
you
in
return
and
now
you
must
join
me
in
my
respects
to
your
aunt
nancy
i
beg
you
not
to
waste
this
in
that
the
way
with
you
ladies
the
had
a
good
effect
upon
the
little
company
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
cloud
which
had
hung
over
it
at
first
had
been
blown
away
when
there
was
no
longer
any
excuse
for
lingering
at
the
table
the
guest
seemed
again
a
little
ill
at
ease
and
after
a
glance
at
his
hostess
proposed
to
nan
that
they
should
take
a
look
at
the
garden
the
old
sailor
had
become
in
his
later
years
a
devoted
tiller
of
the
soil
and
pleaded
a
desire
to
see
some
late
roses
which
were
just
now
in
bloom
so
he
and
nan
went
down
the
walk
together
and
he
fidgeted
and
hurried
about
for
a
few
minutes
before
he
could
make
up
his
mind
to
begin
a
speech
which
was
weighing
heavily
on
his
conscience
nan
was
sure
that
something
unusual
was
perplexing
him
and
answered
his
unnecessary
questions
patiently
wondering
what
he
was
trying
to
say
dear
me
he
grumbled
at
last
i
shall
have
to
steer
a
straight
course
the
truth
is
nancy
has
been
telling
me
that
i
ought
to
advise
with
you
and
see
that
you
understand
what
you
are
about
with
young
gerry
she
has
set
her
heart
on
your
fancying
him
i
dare
say
you
know
she
has
treated
him
like
a
son
all
through
his
growing
up
but
now
that
you
have
come
to
your
rightful
place
she
ca
bear
to
have
anybody
hint
at
your
going
back
to
the
other
people
is
plain
enough
what
he
thinks
about
it
and
i
must
say
i
believe
it
would
be
for
your
good
here
you
are
with
your
father
family
what
is
left
of
it
and
i
take
no
liberty
when
i
tell
you
that
your
aunt
desires
this
to
be
your
home
and
means
to
give
you
your
father
share
of
the
property
now
and
the
rest
when
she
is
done
with
it
it
is
no
more
than
your
rights
and
i
know
as
much
as
anybody
about
it
and
can
tell
you
that
there
a
handsomer
fortune
than
you
may
have
suspected
money
grows
fast
if
it
is
let
alone
and
though
your
aunt
has
done
a
good
deal
for
others
her
expenses
have
been
well
held
in
hand
i
must
say
i
should
like
to
keep
you
here
child
the
captain
faltered
but
i
shall
want
to
do
what
for
your
happiness
i
could
feel
more
earnest
about
that
if
i
were
your
own
father
you
must
think
it
over
i
not
going
to
beseech
you
i
learned
long
ago
that
is
no
use
to
drive
a
prince
nan
had
tried
at
first
to
look
unconcerned
and
treat
the
matter
lightly
but
this
straightforward
talk
appealed
to
her
much
more
than
the
suggestion
and
general
advice
which
miss
prince
had
implored
the
captain
to
give
the
night
before
and
now
her
niece
could
only
thank
him
for
his
kindness
and
tell
him
that
by
and
by
she
would
make
him
understand
why
she
put
aside
these
reasons
and
went
back
to
the
life
she
had
known
before
but
a
sudden
inspiration
made
her
resolution
grow
stronger
and
she
looked
at
captain
parish
with
a
convincing
bravery
when
you
followed
the
sea
she
said
quickly
if
you
had
a
good
ship
with
a
freight
that
you
had
gathered
with
great
care
and
hopefulness
and
had
brought
it
almost
to
the
market
that
it
was
suited
for
would
you
have
been
persuaded
to
turn
about
and
take
it
to
some
place
where
it
would
be
next
to
useless
no
said
captain
parish
no
i
should
and
he
half
smiled
at
this
illustration
i
ca
tell
you
all
my
reasons
for
not
wishing
to
marry
nan
went
on
growing
very
white
and
determined
or
all
my
reasons
for
wishing
to
go
on
with
my
plan
of
being
a
doctor
but
i
know
i
have
no
right
to
the
one
way
of
life
and
a
perfect
one
so
far
as
i
can
see
to
the
other
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
as
sensible
to
ask
gerry
to
be
a
minister
since
he
has
just
finished
his
law
studies
as
to
ask
me
to
be
a
wife
instead
of
a
physician
but
what
i
used
to
dread
without
reason
a
few
years
ago
i
must
forbid
myself
now
because
i
know
the
wretched
inheritance
i
might
have
had
from
my
poor
mother
people
i
ca
speak
of
that
to
aunt
nancy
but
you
must
tell
her
not
to
try
to
make
me
change
my
mind
good
god
said
the
captain
i
dare
say
you
have
the
right
points
of
it
but
if
i
were
a
young
man
would
go
hard
with
me
to
let
you
take
your
life
into
your
own
hands
it
against
nature
no
said
nan
the
law
of
right
and
wrong
must
rule
even
love
and
whatever
comes
to
me
i
must
not
forget
that
three
years
ago
i
had
not
thought
about
it
so
much
and
i
might
not
have
been
so
sure
but
now
i
have
been
taught
there
is
only
one
road
to
take
and
you
must
tell
aunt
nancy
this
but
when
they
went
back
to
the
house
miss
prince
was
not
to
be
seen
and
the
captain
hurried
away
lest
she
should
make
her
appearance
for
he
did
not
wish
just
then
to
talk
about
the
matter
any
more
he
told
himself
that
young
people
were
very
different
in
these
days
but
when
he
thought
of
the
words
he
had
heard
in
the
garden
and
remembered
the
pale
face
and
the
steadfast
voice
he
brushed
away
something
like
a
tear
if
more
people
used
judgment
in
this
same
decision
the
world
would
be
better
off
he
said
and
could
not
help
reminding
himself
that
his
own
niece
little
mary
parish
who
was
wearing
a
wistful
countenance
in
these
days
might
by
and
by
be
happy
after
all
for
nan
part
it
was
a
great
relief
to
have
spoken
to
the
kind
old
man
she
felt
more
secure
than
before
but
sometimes
the
fear
assailed
her
that
some
unforeseen
event
or
unreckoned
influence
might
give
her
back
to
her
indecisions
and
that
the
battle
of
the
night
before
might
after
all
prove
not
to
be
final
the
afternoon
wore
away
and
late
in
the
day
our
heroine
heard
george
gerry
step
coming
up
the
street
she
listened
as
she
sat
by
the
upper
window
and
found
that
he
was
giving
a
message
for
her
it
was
perfect
weather
to
go
up
the
river
he
was
saying
the
tide
served
just
right
and
would
bring
them
home
early
and
miss
prince
who
was
alone
in
the
parlor
answered
with
pleased
assurance
that
she
was
sure
her
niece
would
like
to
go
yes
said
nan
calling
from
the
window
urged
by
a
sudden
impulse
yes
indeed
i
should
like
it
above
all
things
i
will
get
ready
at
once
will
you
carry
two
pairs
of
oars
there
was
a
ready
assent
but
the
uncertainty
of
the
tone
of
it
struck
anna
prince
quick
ear
she
seemed
to
know
that
the
young
man
and
her
aunt
were
exchanging
looks
of
surprise
and
that
they
felt
insecure
and
uncertain
it
was
not
the
yielding
maiden
who
had
spoken
to
her
lover
but
the
girl
who
was
his
good
comrade
and
cordial
friend
the
elder
woman
shook
her
head
doubtfully
she
knew
well
what
this
foreboded
and
was
impatient
at
the
overthrow
of
her
plans
yet
she
had
full
confidence
in
the
power
of
love
she
had
seen
apparent
before
and
she
could
not
believe
that
her
niece
was
invincible
at
any
rate
nothing
could
be
more
persuasive
than
a
twilight
row
upon
the
river
and
for
her
part
she
hoped
more
eagerly
than
ever
that
love
would
return
chief
in
command
of
the
boat
young
crew
and
when
the
young
man
flushed
a
little
and
looked
at
her
appealingly
as
he
turned
to
go
down
the
street
his
friend
and
counselor
could
not
resist
giving
him
a
hopeful
nod
nan
was
singularly
frank
and
free
from
affectations
and
she
might
have
already
decided
to
lower
her
colors
and
yield
the
victory
and
it
seemed
for
a
moment
that
it
would
be
much
more
like
her
to
do
so
than
to
invite
further
contest
when
she
was
already
won
miss
prince
was
very
kind
and
sympathetic
when
this
explanation
had
once
forced
itself
upon
her
mind
she
gave
the
young
girl
a
most
affectionate
kiss
when
she
appeared
but
at
this
unmistakable
suggestion
of
pleasure
and
treasured
hopes
nan
turned
back
suddenly
into
the
shaded
parlor
though
gerry
was
waiting
outside
with
his
favorite
oars
which
he
kept
carefully
in
a
corner
of
the
office
dear
aunt
nancy
said
the
girl
with
evident
effort
i
am
so
sorry
to
disappoint
you
i
wish
for
your
sake
that
i
had
been
another
sort
of
woman
but
i
shall
never
marry
i
know
you
think
i
am
wrong
but
there
is
something
which
always
tells
me
i
am
right
and
i
must
follow
another
way
i
should
only
wreck
my
life
and
other
people
most
girls
have
an
instinct
towards
marrying
but
mine
is
all
against
it
and
god
knew
best
when
he
made
me
care
more
for
another
fashion
of
life
do
make
me
seem
unkind
i
dare
say
that
i
can
put
it
all
into
words
better
by
and
by
but
i
can
never
be
more
certain
of
it
in
my
own
heart
than
now
sit
down
a
minute
said
miss
prince
slowly
george
can
wait
but
anna
i
believe
that
you
are
in
love
with
him
and
that
you
are
doing
wrong
to
the
poor
lad
and
to
yourself
and
to
me
i
lost
the
best
happiness
of
my
life
for
a
whim
and
you
wish
to
throw
away
yours
for
a
theory
i
hope
you
will
be
guided
by
me
i
have
come
to
love
you
very
much
and
it
seems
as
if
this
would
be
so
reasonable
it
does
make
a
difference
to
me
that
he
loves
me
confessed
the
girl
it
is
not
easy
to
turn
away
from
him
she
said
still
standing
and
looking
taller
than
ever
and
even
thin
with
a
curious
tenseness
of
her
whole
being
it
is
something
that
i
have
found
it
hard
to
fight
against
but
it
is
not
my
whole
self
longing
for
his
love
and
his
companionship
if
i
heard
he
had
gone
to
the
other
side
of
the
world
for
years
and
years
i
should
be
glad
now
and
not
sorry
i
know
that
all
the
world
sympathy
and
all
tradition
fight
on
his
side
but
i
can
look
forward
and
see
something
a
thousand
times
better
than
being
his
wife
and
living
here
in
dunport
keeping
his
house
and
trying
to
forget
all
that
nature
fitted
me
to
do
you
understand
aunt
nancy
i
wish
you
could
you
see
it
all
another
way
and
the
tears
started
to
the
eager
young
eyes
do
you
know
that
cousin
walter
said
this
very
day
that
the
wind
which
sets
one
vessel
on
the
right
course
may
set
another
on
the
wrong
nonsense
my
dear
said
the
mistress
of
the
house
i
do
think
this
is
the
proper
time
for
you
to
explain
yourself
at
any
rate
i
dare
say
the
fresh
air
will
do
you
good
and
put
everything
right
too
you
have
worked
yourself
into
a
great
excitement
over
nothing
go
out
looking
so
desperate
to
the
poor
fellow
he
will
think
strangely
of
it
and
the
girl
went
out
through
the
wide
hall
and
wished
she
were
far
away
from
all
this
trouble
nan
had
felt
a
strange
sense
of
weariness
which
did
not
leave
her
even
when
she
was
quieted
by
the
fresh
breeze
of
the
and
was
contented
to
let
her
oars
be
stowed
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
to
take
the
comfortable
seat
in
the
stern
she
pulled
the
tiller
ropes
over
her
shoulders
and
watched
her
lover
first
strong
strokes
which
had
quickly
sent
them
out
into
the
stream
beyond
the
course
of
a
larger
craft
which
was
coming
toward
the
wharf
she
wished
presently
that
she
had
chosen
to
row
because
they
would
not
then
be
face
to
face
but
strange
to
say
since
this
new
experience
had
come
to
her
she
had
not
felt
so
sure
of
herself
as
now
and
the
fear
of
finding
herself
too
weak
to
oppose
the
new
tendency
of
her
life
had
lessened
since
her
first
recognition
of
it
the
night
before
but
nan
had
fought
a
hard
fight
and
had
grown
a
great
deal
older
in
those
hours
of
the
day
and
night
she
believed
that
time
would
make
her
even
more
certain
that
she
had
done
right
than
she
could
be
now
in
the
heat
of
the
battle
but
she
wished
whatever
george
gerry
meant
to
say
to
her
might
be
soon
over
with
they
went
slowly
up
the
river
which
was
now
quite
familiar
to
the
girl
who
had
come
to
it
a
stranger
only
a
few
weeks
before
she
liked
life
so
well
that
this
countryside
of
dunport
was
already
more
dear
to
her
than
to
many
who
had
seen
it
bloom
and
fade
every
year
since
they
could
remember
at
one
moment
it
seemed
but
yesterday
that
she
had
come
to
the
old
town
and
at
the
next
she
felt
as
if
she
had
spent
half
a
lifetime
there
and
as
if
oldfields
might
have
changed
unbearably
since
she
came
away
sometimes
the
young
oarsman
kept
in
the
middle
of
the
great
stream
and
sometimes
it
seemed
pleasanter
to
be
near
the
shore
the
midsummer
flowers
were
coming
into
blossom
and
the
grass
and
trees
had
long
since
lost
the
brilliance
of
their
greenness
and
wore
a
look
of
maturity
and
completion
as
if
they
had
already
finished
their
growth
there
was
a
beautiful
softness
and
harmony
of
color
a
repose
that
one
never
sees
in
a
spring
landscape
the
tide
was
in
the
sun
was
almost
down
and
a
great
cloudless
infinite
sky
arched
itself
from
horizon
to
horizon
it
had
sent
all
its
brilliance
to
shine
backward
from
the
sun
the
glowing
sphere
from
which
a
single
dazzling
ray
came
across
the
fields
and
the
water
to
the
boat
in
a
moment
more
it
was
gone
and
a
shadow
quickly
fell
like
that
of
a
tropical
twilight
but
the
west
grew
golden
and
one
light
cloud
like
a
floating
red
feather
faded
away
upward
into
the
sky
a
later
bright
glow
touched
some
high
hills
in
the
east
then
they
grew
purple
and
gray
and
so
the
evening
came
that
way
slowly
and
the
ripple
of
the
water
plashed
and
sobbed
against
the
boat
side
and
presently
in
the
midst
of
the
inland
bay
after
a
few
last
eager
strokes
the
young
man
drew
in
his
oars
letting
them
drop
with
a
noise
which
startled
nan
who
had
happened
to
be
looking
over
her
shoulder
at
the
shore
she
knew
well
enough
that
he
meant
to
put
a
grave
question
to
her
now
and
her
heart
beat
faster
and
she
twisted
the
tiller
cords
around
her
hands
unconsciously
i
think
i
could
break
any
bonds
you
might
use
to
keep
yourself
away
from
me
he
said
hurriedly
as
he
watched
her
i
am
not
fit
for
you
only
that
i
love
you
somebody
told
me
you
meant
to
go
away
and
i
could
not
wait
any
longer
before
i
asked
you
if
you
would
give
yourself
to
me
no
no
cried
nan
dear
friend
i
must
not
do
it
it
would
all
be
a
mistake
you
must
not
think
of
it
any
more
i
am
so
sorry
i
ought
to
have
understood
what
was
coming
to
us
and
have
gone
away
long
ago
it
would
have
made
no
difference
said
the
young
man
almost
angrily
he
could
not
bear
delay
enough
even
for
speech
at
that
moment
he
watched
her
face
desperately
for
a
look
of
assurance
he
leaned
toward
her
and
wondered
why
he
had
not
risked
everything
and
spoken
the
evening
before
when
they
stood
watching
the
ship
mast
and
nan
hands
were
close
enough
to
be
touched
but
the
miserable
knowledge
crept
over
him
that
she
was
a
great
deal
farther
away
from
him
than
half
that
small
boat
length
and
as
she
looked
up
at
him
again
and
shook
her
head
gently
a
great
rage
of
love
and
shame
at
his
repulse
urged
him
to
plead
again
you
are
spoiling
my
life
he
cried
you
do
not
care
for
that
but
without
you
i
shall
not
care
for
anything
i
would
rather
spoil
your
life
in
this
way
than
in
a
far
worse
fashion
said
nan
sadly
i
will
always
be
your
friend
but
if
i
married
you
i
might
seem
by
and
by
to
be
your
enemy
yes
you
will
love
somebody
else
some
day
and
be
a
great
deal
happier
than
i
could
have
made
you
and
i
shall
be
so
glad
it
does
not
belong
to
me
but
this
seemed
too
scornful
and
oh
my
love
is
only
worth
that
to
you
the
lover
said
you
shall
know
better
what
it
means
i
do
want
you
for
my
friend
but
for
my
own
to
keep
and
to
have
it
makes
me
laugh
to
think
of
your
being
a
doctor
and
going
back
to
that
country
town
to
throw
yourself
away
for
the
fancies
and
silly
theories
of
a
man
who
has
lived
like
a
hermit
it
means
a
true
life
for
both
of
us
if
you
will
only
say
you
love
me
or
even
let
me
ask
you
again
when
you
have
thought
of
it
more
everybody
will
say
i
am
in
the
right
yes
there
are
reasons
enough
for
it
but
there
is
a
better
reason
against
it
if
you
love
me
you
must
help
me
do
what
is
best
said
nan
i
shall
miss
you
and
think
of
you
more
than
you
know
when
i
am
away
i
never
shall
forget
all
these
pleasant
days
we
have
been
together
oh
george
she
cried
in
a
tone
that
thrilled
him
through
and
through
i
hope
you
will
be
friends
with
me
again
by
and
by
you
will
know
then
i
have
done
right
because
it
is
right
and
will
prove
itself
if
it
is
wrong
for
me
i
could
really
make
you
happy
and
over
all
this
and
beyond
it
something
promises
me
and
calls
me
for
a
life
that
my
marrying
you
would
hinder
and
not
help
it
is
that
i
should
be
so
happy
that
it
is
not
easy
to
turn
away
even
from
the
thought
of
it
but
i
know
that
the
days
would
come
when
i
should
see
in
a
way
that
would
make
me
long
to
die
that
i
had
lost
the
true
direction
of
my
life
and
had
misled
others
beside
myself
you
believe
me
but
i
can
not
break
faith
with
my
duty
there
are
many
reasons
that
have
forbidden
me
to
marry
and
i
have
a
certainty
as
sure
as
the
stars
that
the
only
right
condition
of
life
for
me
is
to
follow
the
way
that
everything
until
now
has
pointed
out
the
great
gain
and
purpose
of
my
being
alive
is
there
and
i
must
not
mind
the
blessings
that
i
shall
have
to
do
without
he
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
and
tried
to
interrupt
her
but
she
said
quickly
as
if
to
prevent
his
speaking
listen
to
me
i
help
speaking
plainly
i
would
not
have
come
with
you
this
afternoon
only
i
wished
to
make
you
understand
me
entirely
i
have
never
since
i
can
remember
thought
of
myself
and
my
life
in
any
way
but
unmarried
going
on
alone
to
the
work
i
am
fit
to
do
i
do
care
for
you
i
have
been
greatly
surprised
and
shaken
because
i
found
how
strongly
something
in
me
has
taken
your
part
and
shown
me
the
possibility
of
happiness
in
a
quiet
life
that
should
centre
itself
in
one
man
love
and
within
the
walls
of
his
home
but
something
tells
me
all
the
time
that
i
could
not
marry
the
whole
of
myself
as
most
women
can
there
is
a
great
share
of
my
life
which
could
not
have
its
way
and
could
only
hide
itself
and
be
sorry
i
know
better
and
better
that
most
women
are
made
for
another
sort
of
existence
but
by
and
by
i
must
do
my
part
in
my
own
way
to
make
many
homes
happy
instead
of
one
to
free
them
from
pain
and
teach
grown
people
and
little
children
to
keep
their
bodies
free
from
weakness
and
deformities
i
do
know
why
god
should
have
made
me
a
doctor
so
many
other
things
have
seemed
fitter
for
women
but
i
see
the
blessedness
of
such
a
useful
life
more
and
more
every
year
and
i
am
very
thankful
for
such
a
trust
it
is
a
splendid
thing
to
have
the
use
of
any
gift
of
god
it
is
for
us
to
choose
again
or
wonder
and
dispute
but
just
work
in
our
own
places
and
leave
the
rest
to
god
the
boat
was
being
carried
downward
by
the
ebbing
tide
and
george
gerry
took
the
oars
again
and
rowed
quietly
and
in
silence
he
took
his
defeat
unkindly
and
drearily
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
once
because
some
evil
spirit
told
him
that
he
was
losing
much
that
would
content
him
in
failing
to
gain
this
woman
love
it
had
all
been
so
fair
a
prospect
of
worldly
success
and
she
had
been
the
queen
of
it
he
thought
of
himself
growing
old
in
mr
sergeant
dusty
office
and
that
this
was
all
that
life
could
hold
for
him
yet
to
be
was
better
than
to
have
alas
if
he
had
been
more
earnest
in
his
growth
it
would
have
been
a
power
which
this
girl
of
high
ideals
could
have
been
held
and
mastered
by
no
wonder
that
she
would
not
give
up
her
dreams
of
duty
and
service
since
she
had
found
him
less
strong
than
such
ideals
the
fancied
dissatisfaction
and
piteousness
of
failure
which
she
would
be
sure
to
meet
filled
his
heart
with
dismay
yet
at
that
very
next
moment
resent
it
as
he
might
the
certainty
of
his
own
present
defeat
and
powerlessness
could
not
be
misunderstood
perhaps
after
all
she
knew
what
was
right
her
face
wore
again
the
look
he
had
feared
to
disturb
the
night
before
and
his
whole
soul
was
filled
with
homage
in
the
midst
of
its
sorrow
because
this
girl
who
had
been
his
merry
companion
in
the
summer
holidays
so
sweet
and
familiar
and
unforgetable
in
the
midst
of
the
simple
festivals
stood
nearer
to
holier
things
than
himself
and
had
listened
to
the
call
of
messengers
to
whom
his
own
doors
had
been
ignorantly
shut
and
nan
that
night
was
a
soul
physician
though
she
had
been
made
to
sorely
hurt
her
patient
before
the
new
healthfulness
could
well
begin
they
floated
down
the
river
and
tried
to
talk
once
or
twice
but
there
were
many
spaces
of
silence
and
as
they
walked
along
the
paved
streets
they
thought
of
many
things
an
east
wind
was
blowing
in
from
the
sea
and
the
elm
branches
were
moving
restlessly
overhead
it
will
all
be
better
said
nan
as
they
stood
on
the
steps
at
last
you
must
come
to
see
aunt
nancy
very
often
after
i
have
gone
for
she
will
be
lonely
and
do
come
in
the
morning
as
if
nothing
had
been
spoken
i
am
so
sorry
and
god
bless
you
she
whispered
and
when
she
stood
inside
the
wide
doorway
in
the
dark
she
listened
to
his
footsteps
as
he
went
away
down
the
street
they
were
slower
than
usual
but
she
did
not
call
him
back
xxi
at
home
again
in
oldfields
leslie
had
outwardly
lived
the
familiar
life
to
which
his
friends
and
patients
had
long
since
accustomed
themselves
he
had
seemed
a
little
preoccupied
perhaps
but
if
that
were
observed
it
was
easily
explained
by
his
having
one
or
two
difficult
cases
to
think
about
a
few
persons
suspected
that
he
missed
nan
and
was
perhaps
a
little
anxious
lest
her
father
people
in
dunport
should
claim
her
altogether
among
those
who
knew
best
the
doctor
and
his
ward
there
had
been
an
ardent
championship
of
nan
rights
and
dignity
and
a
great
curiosity
to
know
the
success
of
the
visit
leslie
had
answered
all
questions
with
composure
and
with
a
distressing
meagreness
of
details
but
at
length
graham
became
sure
that
he
was
not
altogether
free
from
anxiety
and
set
her
own
quick
wits
at
work
to
learn
the
cause
it
seemed
a
time
of
great
uncertainty
at
any
rate
the
doctor
sometimes
brought
one
of
nan
bright
affectionate
letters
for
his
neighbor
to
read
and
they
agreed
that
this
holiday
was
an
excellent
thing
for
her
but
there
was
a
silent
recognition
of
the
fact
that
this
was
a
critical
time
in
the
young
girl
history
that
it
either
meant
a
new
direction
of
her
life
or
an
increased
activity
in
the
old
one
graham
was
less
well
than
usual
in
these
days
and
the
doctor
found
time
to
make
more
frequent
visits
than
ever
telling
himself
that
she
missed
nan
pleasant
companionship
but
really
wishing
as
much
to
receive
sympathy
as
to
give
it
the
dear
old
lady
had
laughingly
disclaimed
any
desire
to
summon
her
children
or
grandchildren
saying
that
she
was
neither
ill
enough
to
need
them
nor
well
enough
to
enjoy
them
and
so
in
the
beautiful
june
weather
the
two
old
friends
became
strangely
dear
to
each
other
and
had
many
a
long
talk
which
the
cares
of
the
world
or
their
own
reserve
had
made
them
save
until
this
favoring
season
the
doctor
was
acknowledged
to
be
an
old
man
at
last
though
everybody
still
insisted
that
he
looked
younger
than
his
age
and
could
not
doubt
that
he
had
half
a
lifetime
of
usefulness
before
him
yet
but
it
makes
a
great
difference
when
one
ambitions
are
transferred
from
one
own
life
to
that
of
a
younger
person
and
while
leslie
grew
less
careful
for
himself
trusting
to
the
unconscious
certainty
of
his
practiced
skill
he
pondered
eagerly
over
nan
future
reminding
himself
of
various
hints
and
suggestions
which
must
be
added
to
her
equipment
sometimes
he
wished
that
she
were
beginning
a
few
years
later
when
her
position
could
be
better
recognized
and
respected
and
she
would
not
have
to
fight
against
so
much
of
the
opposition
and
petty
that
come
from
ignorance
and
sometimes
he
rejoiced
that
his
little
girl
as
he
fondly
called
her
would
be
one
of
the
earlier
proofs
and
examples
of
a
certain
noble
advance
and
new
of
civilization
this
has
been
anticipated
through
all
ages
by
the
women
who
sometimes
honored
and
sometimes
persecuted
have
been
drawn
away
from
home
life
by
a
devotion
to
public
and
social
usefulness
it
must
be
recognized
that
certain
qualities
are
required
for
married
and
even
domestic
life
which
all
women
do
not
possess
but
instead
of
attributing
this
to
the
disintegration
of
society
it
must
be
acknowledged
to
belong
to
its
progress
so
long
as
the
visit
in
dunport
seemed
to
fulfill
its
anticipated
purpose
and
the
happy
guest
was
throwing
aside
her
cares
and
enjoying
the
merry
holiday
and
the
excitement
of
new
friendships
and
of
her
uncommon
position
so
long
the
doctor
had
been
glad
and
far
from
impatient
to
have
the
visit
end
but
when
he
read
the
later
and
shorter
letters
again
and
again
in
the
vain
hope
of
finding
something
in
their
wording
which
should
explain
the
vague
unhappiness
which
had
come
to
him
as
he
had
read
them
first
he
began
to
feel
troubled
and
dismayed
there
was
something
which
nan
had
not
explained
something
was
going
wrong
he
was
sure
that
if
it
were
anything
he
could
set
right
that
she
would
have
told
him
she
had
always
done
so
but
it
became
evident
through
the
strange
sympathy
which
made
him
conscious
of
the
mood
of
others
that
she
was
bent
upon
fighting
her
way
alone
it
was
a
matter
of
surprise
and
almost
of
dismay
to
him
early
one
morning
when
he
received
a
brief
note
from
her
which
told
him
only
that
she
should
be
at
home
late
that
afternoon
it
seemed
to
the
wise
old
doctor
a
day
of
most
distressing
uncertainty
he
tried
to
make
up
his
mind
to
accept
with
true
philosophy
whatever
decision
she
was
bringing
him
nan
is
a
good
girl
he
told
himself
over
and
over
again
she
will
try
to
do
right
but
she
was
so
young
and
so
generous
and
whether
she
had
been
implored
to
break
the
old
ties
of
home
life
and
affection
for
her
aunt
sake
or
whether
it
was
a
newer
and
stronger
influence
still
which
had
prevailed
waited
for
explanation
alas
as
was
written
once
it
is
often
the
higher
nature
that
yields
because
it
is
the
most
generous
the
doctor
knew
well
enough
the
young
girl
character
he
knew
what
promises
of
growth
and
uncommon
achievement
were
all
ready
to
unfold
themselves
for
what
great
uses
she
was
made
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
her
being
handicapped
in
the
race
she
had
been
set
to
run
yet
no
one
recognized
more
clearly
than
he
the
unseen
and
too
often
unconsidered
factor
which
is
peculiar
to
each
soul
which
prevents
any
other
intelligence
from
putting
itself
exactly
in
that
soul
place
so
that
our
decisions
and
aids
and
suggestions
are
never
wholly
sufficient
or
available
for
those
even
whom
we
love
most
he
went
over
the
question
again
and
again
he
followed
nan
in
his
thoughts
as
she
had
grown
up
unprejudiced
unconstrained
as
is
possible
for
any
human
being
to
be
he
remembered
that
her
heroes
were
the
great
doctors
and
that
her
whole
heart
had
been
stirred
and
claimed
by
the
noble
duties
and
needs
of
the
great
profession
she
had
been
careless
of
the
social
limitations
of
the
lack
of
sympathy
even
of
the
ridicule
of
the
public
she
had
behaved
as
a
bird
would
behave
if
it
were
assured
by
beasts
and
fishes
that
to
walk
and
to
swim
were
the
only
proper
and
respectable
means
of
getting
from
place
to
place
she
had
shown
such
rare
insight
into
the
principles
of
things
she
had
even
seemed
to
him
as
he
watched
her
to
have
anticipated
experience
and
he
could
not
help
believing
that
it
was
within
her
power
to
add
much
to
the
too
small
fund
of
certainty
by
the
sure
instinct
and
aim
of
her
experiment
it
counted
nothing
whether
god
had
put
this
soul
into
a
man
body
or
a
woman
he
had
known
best
and
he
meant
it
to
be
the
teller
of
new
truth
a
revealer
of
laws
and
an
influence
for
good
in
its
capacity
for
teaching
as
well
as
in
its
example
of
pure
and
reasonable
life
but
the
old
doctor
sighed
and
told
himself
that
the
girl
was
most
human
most
affectionate
it
was
not
impossible
that
in
spite
of
her
apparent
absence
of
certain
domestic
instincts
they
had
only
lain
dormant
and
were
now
awake
he
could
not
bear
that
she
should
lose
any
happiness
which
might
be
hers
and
the
tender
memory
of
the
blessed
companionship
which
had
been
withdrawn
from
his
mortal
sight
only
to
be
given
back
to
him
more
fully
as
he
had
lived
closer
and
nearer
to
spiritual
things
made
him
shrink
from
forbidding
the
same
sort
of
fullness
and
completion
of
life
to
one
so
dear
as
nan
he
tried
to
assure
himself
that
while
a
man
life
is
strengthened
by
his
domestic
happiness
a
woman
must
either
surrender
itself
wholly
or
relinquish
entirely
the
claims
of
such
duties
if
she
would
achieve
distinction
or
satisfaction
elsewhere
the
two
can
not
be
taken
together
in
a
woman
life
as
in
a
man
one
must
be
made
of
lesser
consequence
though
the
very
natures
of
both
domestic
and
professional
life
need
all
the
strength
which
can
be
brought
to
them
the
decision
between
them
he
knew
to
be
a
most
grave
responsibility
and
one
to
be
governed
by
the
gravest
moral
obligations
and
the
unmistakable
leadings
of
the
personal
instincts
and
ambitions
it
was
seldom
leslie
was
aware
that
so
typical
and
evident
an
example
as
this
could
offer
itself
of
the
class
of
women
who
are
a
result
of
natural
progression
and
variation
not
for
better
work
but
for
different
work
and
who
are
designed
for
certain
public
and
social
duties
but
he
believed
this
class
to
be
one
that
must
inevitably
increase
with
the
higher
developments
of
civilization
and
in
later
years
which
he
might
never
see
the
love
for
humanity
would
be
recognized
and
employed
more
intelligently
while
now
almost
every
popular
prejudice
was
against
his
ward
then
she
would
need
no
vindication
the
wielder
of
ideas
has
always
a
certain
advantage
over
the
depender
upon
facts
and
though
the
two
classes
of
minds
by
no
means
inevitably
belong
the
one
to
women
and
the
other
to
men
still
women
have
not
yet
begun
to
use
the
best
resources
of
their
natures
having
been
later
developed
and
in
many
countries
but
recently
freed
from
restraining
and
hindering
influences
the
preservation
of
the
race
is
no
longer
the
only
important
question
the
welfare
of
the
individual
will
be
considered
more
and
more
the
simple
fact
that
there
is
a
majority
of
women
in
any
centre
of
civilization
means
that
some
are
set
apart
by
nature
for
other
uses
and
conditions
than
marriage
in
ancient
times
men
depended
entirely
upon
the
women
of
their
households
to
prepare
their
food
and
clothing
and
almost
every
man
in
ordinary
circumstances
of
life
was
forced
to
marry
for
this
reason
but
already
there
is
a
great
change
the
greater
proportion
of
men
and
women
everywhere
will
still
instinctively
and
gladly
accept
the
high
duties
and
helps
of
married
life
but
as
society
becomes
more
intelligent
it
will
recognize
the
fitness
of
some
persons
and
the
unfitness
of
others
making
it
impossible
for
these
to
accept
such
responsibilities
and
obligations
and
so
dignify
and
elevate
home
life
instead
of
degrading
it
it
had
been
one
thing
to
act
from
conviction
and
from
the
promptings
of
instinct
while
no
obstacles
opposed
themselves
to
his
decisions
and
quite
another
thing
to
be
brought
face
to
face
with
such
an
emergency
leslie
wished
first
to
be
able
to
distinctly
explain
to
himself
his
reasons
for
the
opinions
he
held
he
knew
that
he
must
judge
for
nan
herself
in
some
measure
she
would
surely
appeal
to
him
she
would
bring
this
great
question
to
him
and
look
for
sympathy
and
relief
in
the
same
way
she
had
tearfully
shown
him
a
wounded
finger
in
her
childhood
he
seemed
to
see
again
the
entreating
eyes
made
large
with
the
pain
which
would
not
show
itself
in
any
other
way
and
he
felt
the
rare
tears
fill
his
own
eyes
at
the
thought
poor
little
nan
he
said
to
himself
she
has
been
hurt
in
the
great
battle
but
she
is
no
skulking
soldier
he
would
let
her
tell
her
story
and
then
give
her
the
best
help
he
could
and
so
when
the
afternoon
shadows
were
very
long
across
the
country
and
the
hot
summer
day
was
almost
done
the
doctor
drove
down
the
wide
street
and
along
east
road
to
the
railroad
station
as
he
passed
a
group
of
small
houses
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
found
that
there
was
more
than
time
for
a
second
visit
to
a
sick
child
whose
illness
had
been
most
serious
and
perplexing
at
first
though
now
she
was
fast
recovering
the
little
thing
smiled
as
her
friend
came
in
and
asked
if
the
young
lady
were
coming
for
leslie
had
promised
a
visit
and
a
from
nan
whom
he
wished
to
see
and
understand
the
case
they
had
had
a
long
talk
upon
such
ailments
as
this
just
before
she
went
away
and
nothing
had
seemed
to
rouse
her
ambition
so
greatly
as
her
experiences
at
the
children
hospitals
the
winter
before
now
this
weak
little
creature
seemed
to
be
pleading
in
the
name
of
a
great
army
of
sick
children
that
nan
would
not
desert
their
cause
that
she
would
go
on
as
she
had
promised
them
with
her
search
for
ways
that
should
restore
their
vigor
and
increase
their
fitness
to
take
up
the
work
of
the
world
and
yet
a
home
and
children
of
one
very
own
the
doctor
who
had
held
and
lost
this
long
ago
felt
powerless
to
decide
the
future
of
the
young
heart
which
was
so
dear
to
him
nan
saw
the
familiar
old
horse
and
carriage
waiting
behind
the
station
and
did
not
fail
to
notice
that
the
doctor
had
driven
to
meet
her
himself
he
almost
always
did
but
her
very
anxiety
to
see
him
again
had
made
her
doubtful
the
train
had
hardly
stopped
before
she
was
standing
on
the
platform
and
had
hastily
dropped
her
checks
into
the
hand
of
the
nearest
idle
boy
who
looked
at
them
doubtfully
as
if
he
hardly
dared
to
hope
that
he
had
been
mistaken
for
the
hackman
she
came
quickly
to
the
side
of
the
carriage
the
doctor
could
not
look
at
her
for
the
horse
had
made
believe
that
some
excitement
was
necessary
and
was
making
it
difficult
for
the
welcome
passenger
to
put
her
foot
on
the
step
it
was
all
over
in
a
minute
nan
sprang
to
the
doctor
side
and
away
they
went
down
the
road
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
shining
eyes
and
eager
face
as
she
had
hurried
toward
him
and
had
said
well
done
in
a
most
cheerful
and
fashion
and
then
for
a
minute
there
was
silence
oh
it
is
so
good
to
get
home
said
the
girl
and
her
companion
turned
toward
her
he
could
not
wait
to
hear
her
story
yes
said
nan
it
is
just
as
well
to
tell
you
now
do
you
remember
you
used
to
say
to
me
when
i
was
a
little
girl
you
know
your
duty
do
mind
the
best
of
reasons
for
not
doing
it
and
the
doctor
nodded
i
never
thought
that
this
reason
would
come
to
me
for
not
being
a
doctor
she
went
on
and
at
first
i
was
afraid
i
should
be
conquered
though
it
was
myself
who
fought
myself
but
it
came
to
me
clearer
than
ever
after
a
while
i
think
i
could
have
been
fonder
of
some
one
than
most
people
are
of
those
whom
they
marry
but
the
more
i
cared
for
him
the
less
i
could
give
him
only
part
of
myself
i
knew
that
was
not
right
now
that
i
can
look
back
at
it
all
i
am
so
glad
to
have
had
those
days
i
shall
work
better
all
my
life
for
having
been
able
to
make
myself
so
perfectly
sure
that
i
know
my
way
the
unconsidered
factor
had
asserted
itself
in
the
doctor
favor
he
gave
the
reins
to
nan
and
leaned
back
in
the
carriage
but
as
she
bent
forward
to
speak
to
a
friend
whom
they
passed
she
did
not
see
the
look
that
he
gave
her
i
am
sure
you
knew
what
was
right
he
said
hastily
god
bless
you
dear
child
was
this
little
nan
who
had
been
his
this
brave
young
creature
to
whose
glorious
future
all
his
heart
and
hopes
went
out
in
his
evening
it
was
her
morning
and
he
prayed
that
god
angels
should
comfort
and
strengthen
her
and
help
her
to
carry
the
burden
of
the
day
it
is
only
those
who
can
do
nothing
who
find
nothing
to
do
and
nan
was
no
idler
she
had
come
to
her
work
as
christ
came
to
his
not
to
be
ministered
unto
but
to
minister
the
months
went
by
swiftly
and
through
hard
work
and
much
study
and
many
sights
of
pain
and
sorrow
this
young
student
of
the
business
of
healing
made
her
way
to
the
day
when
some
of
her
companions
announced
with
melancholy
truth
that
they
had
finished
their
studies
they
were
pretty
sure
to
be
accused
of
having
had
no
right
to
begin
them
or
to
take
such
trusts
and
responsibilities
into
their
hands
but
nan
and
many
of
her
friends
had
gladly
climbed
the
hill
so
far
and
with
every
year
ascent
had
been
thankful
for
the
wider
horizon
which
was
spread
for
their
eyes
to
see
leslie
in
his
quiet
study
almost
wished
that
he
were
beginning
life
again
and
sometimes
in
the
twilight
or
in
long
and
lonely
country
drives
believed
himself
ready
to
go
back
twenty
years
so
that
he
could
follow
nan
into
the
future
and
watch
her
successes
but
he
always
smiled
afterward
at
such
a
thought
twenty
years
would
carry
him
back
to
the
time
when
his
ward
was
a
little
child
not
long
before
she
came
to
live
with
him
it
was
best
as
god
had
planned
it
nobody
had
watched
the
child
development
as
he
had
done
or
her
growth
of
character
of
which
all
the
performances
of
her
later
years
would
be
to
him
only
the
unnecessary
proofs
and
evidences
he
knew
that
she
would
be
faithful
in
great
things
because
she
had
been
faithful
in
little
things
and
he
should
be
with
her
a
long
time
yet
perhaps
god
only
knew
there
was
a
great
change
in
the
village
there
were
more
small
factories
now
which
employed
large
numbers
of
young
women
and
though
a
new
doctor
had
long
ago
come
to
oldfields
who
had
begun
by
trying
to
supersede
leslie
he
had
ended
by
longing
to
show
his
gratitude
some
day
for
so
much
help
and
kindness
more
than
one
appointment
had
been
offered
the
heroine
of
this
story
in
the
city
hospitals
she
would
have
little
trouble
in
making
her
way
since
she
had
the
requisite
qualities
natural
and
acquired
which
secure
success
but
she
decided
for
herself
that
she
would
neither
do
this
nor
carry
out
yet
the
other
plan
of
going
on
with
her
studies
at
some
school
across
the
sea
zurich
held
out
a
great
temptation
but
there
was
time
enough
yet
and
she
would
spend
a
year
in
oldfields
with
the
doctor
studying
again
with
him
since
she
knew
better
than
ever
before
that
she
could
find
no
wiser
teacher
and
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
belong
to
the
dear
old
town
to
come
home
to
it
with
her
new
treasures
so
much
richer
than
she
had
gone
away
that
beside
medicines
and
bandages
and
lessons
in
general
hygiene
for
the
physical
ails
of
her
patients
she
could
often
be
a
tonic
to
the
mind
and
soul
and
since
she
was
trying
to
be
good
go
about
doing
good
in
christ
name
to
the
halt
and
maimed
and
blind
in
spiritual
things
nobody
sees
people
as
they
are
and
finds
the
chance
to
help
poor
humanity
as
a
doctor
does
the
decorations
and
deceptions
of
character
must
fall
away
before
the
great
realities
of
pain
and
death
the
secrets
of
many
hearts
and
homes
must
be
told
to
this
confessor
and
sadder
ailments
than
the
name
are
brought
to
be
healed
by
the
beloved
physicians
teachers
of
truth
and
givers
of
the
laws
of
life
priests
and
ministers
all
these
professions
are
joined
in
one
with
the
gift
of
healing
and
are
each
part
of
the
charge
that
a
good
doctor
holds
in
his
keeping
one
day
in
the
beginning
of
her
year
at
oldfields
nan
who
had
been
very
busy
suddenly
thought
it
would
be
well
to
give
herself
a
holiday
and
with
a
sudden
return
of
her
old
sense
of
freedom
was
going
out
at
the
door
and
down
toward
the
gateway
which
opened
to
a
pleasantly
wide
world
beyond
marilla
had
taken
nan
successes
rather
reluctantly
and
never
hesitated
to
say
that
she
only
hoped
to
see
her
well
married
and
settled
before
she
died
though
she
was
always
ready
to
defend
her
course
with
even
virulence
to
those
who
would
deprecate
it
she
now
heard
nan
shut
the
door
and
called
at
once
from
an
upper
window
to
know
if
word
had
been
left
where
she
was
going
and
the
young
practitioner
laughed
aloud
as
she
answered
and
properly
acknowledged
the
fetter
of
her
calling
the
leaves
were
just
beginning
to
fall
and
she
pushed
them
about
with
her
feet
and
sometimes
walked
and
sometimes
ran
lightly
along
the
road
toward
the
farm
but
when
she
reached
it
she
passed
the
lane
and
went
on
to
the
dyer
houses
jake
was
ailing
as
usual
and
nan
had
told
the
doctor
before
she
came
out
that
she
would
venture
another
professional
visit
in
his
stead
she
was
a
great
help
to
him
in
this
way
for
his
calls
to
distant
towns
had
increased
year
by
year
and
he
often
found
it
hard
to
keep
his
many
patients
well
in
hand
the
old
houses
had
not
changed
much
since
she
first
knew
them
and
neither
they
nor
their
inmates
were
in
any
danger
of
being
forgotten
by
her
the
old
ties
of
affection
and
association
grew
stronger
instead
of
weaker
every
year
it
pleased
and
amused
the
old
people
to
be
reminded
of
the
days
when
nan
was
a
child
and
lived
among
them
and
it
was
a
great
joy
to
her
to
be
able
to
make
their
pain
and
discomfort
less
and
be
their
interpreter
of
the
outside
world
it
was
a
most
lovely
day
of
our
heroine
favorite
weather
it
has
been
said
that
november
is
an
epitome
of
all
the
months
of
the
year
but
for
all
that
no
other
season
can
show
anything
so
beautiful
as
the
best
and
brightest
november
days
nan
had
spent
her
summer
in
a
great
hospital
where
she
saw
few
flowers
save
human
ones
and
the
warmth
and
inspiration
of
this
clear
air
seemed
most
delightful
she
had
been
somewhat
tempted
by
an
offer
of
a
fine
position
in
canada
and
even
leslie
had
urged
her
acceptance
and
thought
it
an
uncommonly
good
chance
to
have
the
best
hospital
experience
and
responsibility
but
she
had
sent
the
letter
of
refusal
only
that
morning
she
could
not
tell
yet
what
her
later
plans
might
be
but
there
was
no
place
like
oldfields
and
she
thought
she
had
never
loved
it
so
dearly
as
that
afternoon
she
looked
in
at
martin
door
first
but
finding
the
kitchen
empty
went
quickly
across
to
the
other
house
where
jake
was
propped
up
in
her
and
began
to
groan
loudly
when
she
saw
nan
but
the
tonic
of
so
gratifying
a
presence
soon
had
a
most
favorable
effect
benignant
martin
was
knitting
as
usual
and
the
three
women
sat
together
in
a
friendly
group
and
nan
asked
and
answered
questions
most
cordially
i
declare
i
was
sort
of
put
out
with
the
doctor
for
sending
you
down
here
day
before
yesterday
instead
of
coming
himself
stated
jake
immediately
but
i
do
know
i
ever
had
anything
do
me
so
much
good
as
that
bottle
you
gave
me
of
course
laughed
nan
leslie
sent
it
to
you
himself
i
told
you
when
i
gave
it
to
you
well
now
how
you
talk
said
jake
a
little
crestfallen
i
begin
to
find
my
hearing
fails
me
by
spells
but
i
was
bound
to
give
you
the
credit
for
all
i
stood
out
against
your
meddling
with
a
doctor
business
nan
laughed
merrily
i
am
going
to
steal
you
for
my
patient
she
answered
and
try
all
the
prescriptions
on
your
case
first
land
if
you
cured
her
up
be
like
stopping
the
leaks
in
a
basket
announced
martin
with
a
beaming
smile
and
clicking
her
excitedly
she
ca
hear
of
a
complaint
anywheres
about
but
she
thinks
she
got
the
mate
to
it
i
do
seem
to
have
anything
fevery
about
me
said
jake
with
an
air
of
patient
and
though
both
her
companions
were
most
compassionate
at
the
thought
of
her
real
sufferings
they
could
not
resist
the
least
bit
of
a
smile
i
declare
you
done
one
thing
if
you
never
going
to
do
any
more
said
jake
presently
here
been
talking
for
some
time
past
about
your
straightening
up
the
little
boy
back
the
one
that
lives
down
where
mis
meeker
used
to
live
you
know
but
i
did
seem
to
take
it
in
till
he
come
over
here
yisterday
forenoon
looks
as
likely
as
any
child
except
it
may
be
he
a
little
stunted
when
i
think
how
he
used
to
creep
about
there
side
of
the
road
like
a
it
does
seem
amazin
nan
eyes
brightened
i
have
been
delighted
about
that
i
saw
him
running
with
the
other
children
as
i
came
down
the
road
it
was
a
long
bit
of
work
though
the
doctor
did
most
of
it
i
did
see
the
child
for
months
you
know
but
he
needs
care
yet
i
going
to
stop
and
have
another
talk
with
his
mother
as
i
go
home
she
a
pore
shiftless
creature
martin
hastened
to
say
there
i
thought
o
the
doctor
how
he
laugh
the
last
time
i
was
in
to
see
her
her
baby
was
sick
and
she
sent
up
to
know
if
i
lend
her
a
variety
of
herbs
and
i
did
know
but
she
might
it
so
i
stepped
down
with
something
myself
she
begun
to
flutter
about
like
she
always
does
and
i
picked
my
way
acrost
the
kitchen
to
the
cradle
says
she
have
been
laying
out
all
this
week
to
go
up
to
the
corners
and
git
me
two
new
chairs
should
think
you
had
plenty
of
chairs
now
said
i
and
she
looked
at
me
sort
of
surprised
and
says
she
ai
a
chair
in
this
house
but
what
full
and
nan
laughed
as
heartily
as
could
have
been
desired
before
she
asked
jake
a
few
more
appreciative
questions
about
her
ailments
and
then
rose
to
go
away
martin
followed
her
out
to
the
gate
she
and
nan
had
always
been
very
fond
of
each
other
and
the
elder
woman
pointed
to
a
field
not
far
away
where
the
brothers
were
watching
a
which
was
sending
up
a
thin
blue
thread
of
smoke
into
the
still
air
they
were
over
in
your
north
lot
yisterday
said
martin
they
fullest
o
business
nowadays
when
there
least
to
do
they
took
it
pretty
hard
when
they
first
had
to
come
down
to
hiring
help
but
they
kind
of
enjoy
it
now
we
all
old
folks
together
on
the
farm
and
not
good
for
much
it
do
seem
but
a
year
or
two
since
your
poor
mother
was
playing
about
here
and
then
you
come
along
and
now
you
the
last
o
your
folks
out
of
all
the
houseful
of
i
knew
i
own
up
sometimes
i
thought
strange
of
your
fancy
for
doctoring
but
i
never
said
a
word
to
nobody
against
it
so
i
have
got
anything
to
take
back
as
most
folks
have
i
could
help
thinking
when
you
come
in
this
afternoon
and
sat
there
along
of
us
that
i
give
a
good
deal
to
have
mis
thacher
step
in
and
see
you
and
know
what
you
made
o
yourself
she
had
it
hard
for
a
good
many
years
but
i
believe
is
all
made
up
to
her
i
do
certain
nan
meant
to
go
back
to
the
village
by
the
shorter
way
of
the
little
but
first
she
went
up
the
lane
toward
the
old
she
stood
for
a
minute
looking
about
her
and
across
the
fields
and
then
seated
herself
on
the
and
stayed
there
for
some
time
there
were
two
or
three
sheep
near
by
well
covered
and
rounded
by
their
soft
new
winter
wool
and
they
all
came
as
close
as
they
dared
and
looked
at
her
wonderingly
the
narrow
path
that
used
to
be
worn
to
the
had
been
overgrown
years
ago
with
the
short
grass
and
in
it
there
was
a
late
little
dandelion
with
hardly
any
stem
at
all
the
sunshine
was
warm
and
all
the
country
was
wrapped
in
a
thin
soft
haze
she
thought
of
her
grandmother
thacher
and
of
the
words
that
had
just
been
said
it
was
beginning
to
seem
a
very
great
while
since
the
days
of
the
old
and
nan
smiled
as
she
remembered
with
what
tones
of
despair
the
good
old
woman
used
to
repeat
the
phrase
that
her
grandchild
would
make
either
something
or
nothing
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
brought
all
the
success
of
the
past
and
her
hopes
for
the
future
to
the
dear
old
place
that
afternoon
her
early
life
was
spreading
itself
out
like
a
picture
and
as
she
thought
it
over
and
looked
back
from
year
to
year
she
was
more
than
ever
before
surprised
to
see
the
connection
of
one
thing
with
another
and
how
some
slight
acts
had
been
the
planting
of
seeds
which
had
grown
and
flourished
long
afterward
and
as
she
tried
to
follow
herself
back
into
the
cloudy
days
of
her
earliest
spring
she
rose
without
knowing
why
and
went
down
the
pastures
toward
the
river
she
passed
the
old
english
which
still
held
aloft
a
flourishing
bough
its
fruit
had
been
gathered
but
there
were
one
or
two
stray
apples
left
and
nan
skillfully
threw
a
stick
at
these
by
way
of
summons
along
this
path
she
had
hurried
or
faltered
many
a
time
she
remembered
her
grandmother
funeral
and
how
she
had
walked
with
an
elderly
cousin
whom
she
did
not
know
at
the
head
of
the
procession
and
had
seen
martin
dyer
small
grandson
peeping
like
a
rabbit
from
among
the
underbrush
near
the
shore
poor
little
nan
she
was
very
lonely
that
day
she
had
been
so
glad
when
the
doctor
had
wrapped
her
up
and
taken
her
home
she
saw
the
neighborly
old
that
grew
by
a
cellar
and
stopped
to
listen
to
its
rustling
and
to
lay
her
hand
upon
the
rough
bark
it
had
been
a
cause
of
wonder
once
for
she
knew
no
other
tree
of
the
kind
it
was
like
a
when
it
was
in
bloom
and
in
the
cellar
she
had
spent
many
an
hour
for
there
was
a
good
shelter
from
the
wind
and
an
excellent
though
it
seemed
very
shallow
now
when
she
looked
at
it
as
she
went
by
the
was
shut
in
by
a
plain
stone
wall
which
she
had
long
ago
asked
the
dyers
to
build
for
her
and
she
leaned
over
it
now
and
looked
at
the
smooth
turf
of
the
low
graves
she
had
always
thought
she
would
like
to
lie
there
too
when
her
work
was
done
there
were
some
of
the
graves
which
she
did
not
know
but
one
was
her
poor
young
mother
who
had
left
her
no
inheritance
except
some
traits
that
had
won
nan
many
friends
all
her
evil
gifts
had
been
buried
with
her
the
neighbors
had
said
when
the
girl
was
out
of
hearing
that
very
afternoon
there
was
a
strange
fascination
about
these
river
uplands
no
place
was
so
dear
to
nan
and
yet
she
often
thought
with
a
shudder
of
the
story
of
those
footprints
which
had
sought
the
river
brink
and
then
turned
back
perhaps
made
pure
and
strong
in
a
better
world
in
which
some
lingering
love
and
faith
had
given
her
the
true
direction
at
last
where
even
her
love
for
her
child
had
saved
her
the
mother
had
been
still
taking
care
of
little
nan
and
guiding
her
perhaps
she
had
helped
to
make
sure
of
the
blessings
her
own
life
had
lost
of
truth
and
whiteness
of
soul
and
usefulness
and
so
had
been
still
bringing
her
child
in
her
arms
toward
the
great
shelter
and
home
as
she
had
toiled
in
her
fright
and
weakness
that
dark
and
miserable
night
toward
the
house
on
the
hill
and
nan
stood
on
the
shore
while
the
warm
wind
that
gently
blew
her
hair
felt
almost
like
a
hand
and
presently
she
went
closer
to
the
river
and
looked
far
across
it
and
beyond
it
to
the
hills
the
eagles
swung
to
and
fro
above
the
water
but
she
looked
beyond
them
into
the
sky
the
soft
air
and
the
sunshine
came
close
to
her
the
trees
stood
about
and
seemed
to
watch
her
and
suddenly
she
reached
her
hands
upward
in
an
ecstasy
of
life
and
strength
and
gladness
o
god
she
said
i
thank
thee
for
my
future

was
carried
on
by
jefferson

whose

wagon
was
usually
much
too
large
for
the
demands
of

both
the
sanscrit

people
were
and
briley

made

in

solitude

for
the

leather
which
he
held
firmly
to
the
floor
of
the
carriage
with
his
heavily
shod
left
foot
the
had
almost
a
personality
to
him
born
of
long
association
briley
was
a
meek
and
body
but
he
held
a
warlike
soul
and
encouraged
his
fancies
by
reading
awful
tales
of
bloodshed
and
lawlessness
in
the
far
west
mindful
of
stage
robberies
and
train
thieves
and
of
express
messengers
who
died
at
their
posts
he
was
prepared
for
anything
and
although
he
had
trusted
to
his
own
strength
and
bravery
these
many
years
he
carried
a
heavy
pistol
under
his
cushion
for
better
defense
this
awful
weapon
was
familiar
to
all
his
regular
passengers
and
was
usually
shown
to
strangers
by
the
time
two
of
the
seven
miles
of
briley
route
had
been
passed
the
pistol
was
not
loaded
nobody
at
least
not
briley
himself
doubted
that
the
mere
sight
of
such
a
weapon
would
turn
the
boldest
adventurer
aside
protected
by
such
a
man
and
such
a
piece
of
armament
one
gray
friday
morning
in
the
edge
of
winter
fanny
tobin
was
traveling
from
sanscrit
pond
to
north
kilby
she
was
an
elderly
and
woman
but
with
a
shrewd
twinkle
in
her
eyes
and
she
felt
very
anxious
about
her
numerous
pieces
of
baggage
and
her
own
personal
safety
she
was
enveloped
in
many
shawls
and
smaller
wrappings
but
they
were
not
securely
fastened
and
kept
getting
undone
and
flying
loose
so
that
the
bitter
december
cold
seemed
to
be
picking
a
lock
now
and
then
and
creeping
in
to
steal
away
the
little
warmth
she
had
briley
was
cold
too
and
could
only
cheer
himself
by
remembering
the
valor
of
those
drivers
of
the
days
who
had
to
cross
the
rocky
mountains
on
the
great
california
route
he
spoke
at
length
of
their
perils
to
the
suffering
passenger
who
felt
none
the
warmer
and
at
last
gave
a
groan
of
weariness
how
fur
did
you
say
was
now
i
do
know
i
said
mis
tobin
answered
the
driver
with
a
frosty
laugh
you
see
them
big
pines
and
the
side
of
a
barn
just
this
way
with
them

this
faithful
creature
a
rest
three
times
a
mile
and
took
four
hours
for
the
journey
by
himself
and
longer
whenever
he
had
a
passenger
but
in
pleasant
weather
the
road
was
delightful
and
full
of
people
who
drove
their
own
conveyances
and
liked
to
stop
and
talk
there
were
not
many
farms
and
the
third
growth
of
white
pines
made
a
pleasant
shade
though
jefferson
liked
to
say
that
when
he
began
to
carry
the
mail
his
way
lay
through
an
open
country
of
stumps
and
sparse
underbrush
where
the
white
pines
nowadays
completely
arched
the
road
they
had
passed
the
barn
with
circus
posters
and
felt
colder
than
ever
when
they
caught
sight
of
the
acrobats
in
their
tights
my
gorry
exclaimed
widow
tobin
them
pore
creatur
looks
as
cheerless
as
little
in
i
hope
they
dresses
warmer
this
time
o
year
now
there
look
at
that
one
jumpin
through
the
little
hoop
will
ye
he
could
git
himself
through
there
with
two
pair
o
pants
on
answered
briley
i
expect
they
must
have
to
keep
limber
as
eels
i
used
to
think
when
i
was
a
boy
that
was
the
only
thing
i
could
ever
be
reconciled
to
do
for
a
livin
i
set
out
to
run
away
follow
a
rovin
showman
once
but
mother
needed
me
to
home
there
war
nobody
but
me
an
the
little
gals
you
ai
the
only
one
that
o
their
desire
said
tobin
sadly
war
so
that
i
could
be
spared
from
home
to
learn
the
dressmaker
trade
would
a
come
handy
later
on
i
declare
answered
the
sympathetic
driver
bein
you
went
an
had
such
a
passel
o
gals
to
clothe
feed
there
them
that
livin
is
all
well
off
now
but
it
must
been
some
inconvenient
for
ye
when
they
was
small
yes
briley
but
then
i
had
my
mercies
too
said
the
widow
somewhat
grudgingly
i
take
it
master
hard
now
though
havin
to
give
up
my
own
home
and
live
round
from
place
to
place
if
they
be
my
own
there
was
and
susan
ellen
fussin
an
yesterday
about
who
got
to
have
me
next
and
lord
be
thanked
they
both
wanted
me
right
off
but
i
hated
to
hear
talkin
of
it
over
i
rather
live
to
home
and
do
for
myself
i
got
used
to
boardin
said
jefferson
sence
died
but
it
made
me
ache
at
the
fust
on
i
tell
ye
bein
on
the
road
i
be
i
could
do
no
ways
at
keepin
house
i
should
want
to
keep
right
there
and
see
to
things
course
you
would
replied
tobin
with
a
sudden
inspiration
of
opportunity
which
sent
a
welcome
glow
all
over
her
course
you
would
she
leaned
toward
the
front
seat
that
is
to
say
onless
you
had
jest
the
right
one
to
do
it
for
ye
and
jefferson
felt
a
strange
glow
also
and
a
sense
of
unexpected
interest
and
enjoyment
see
here
sister
tobin
he
exclaimed
with
enthusiasm
why
ca
ye
take
the
trouble
to
shift
seats
and
come
front
here
long
o
me
we
could
put
one
top
o
the
other
they
both
thin
and
set
close
and
i
do
know
but
we
sh
be
more
protected
the
weather
well
i
could
be
no
colder
if
i
was
froze
to
death
answered
the
widow
with
an
amiable
simper
do
ye
let
me
delay
you
nor
put
you
out
briley
i
do
know
i
set
forth
if
i
known
was
so
cold
but
i
had
all
my
bundles
done
up
and
i
ai
one
that
puts
my
hand
to
the
plough
an
looks
back
to
scriptur
you
would
wanted
me
to
ride
all
them
seven
miles
alone
asked
the
gallant
briley
sentimentally
as
he
lifted
her
down
and
helped
her
up
again
to
the
front
seat
she
was
a
few
years
older
than
he
but
they
had
been
schoolmates
and
tobin
youthful
freshness
was
suddenly
revived
to
his
mind
eye
she
had
a
little
farm
there
was
nobody
left
at
home
now
but
herself
and
so
she
had
broken
up
housekeeping
for
the
winter
jefferson
himself
had
savings
of
no
mean
amount
they
tucked
themselves
in
and
felt
better
for
the
change
but
there
was
a
sudden
awkwardness
between
them
they
had
not
had
time
to
prepare
for
an
unexpected
crisis
they
say
elder
bickers
over
to
east
sanscrit
been
and
got
married
again
to
a
gal
that
four
year
younger
than
his
oldest
daughter
proclaimed
tobin
presently
seems
to
me
was
business
i
view
it
so
said
the
there
goin
to
be
a
mild
open
winter
for
that
what
a
joker
you
be
for
a
man
that
had
so
much
responsibility
smiled
tobin
after
they
had
done
laughing
ai
you
never
carryin
mail
matter
and
such
valuable
stuff
that
you
be
set
on
an
robbed
by
night
jefferson
braced
his
feet
against
the
dasher
under
the
worn
buffalo
skin
it
is
kind
o
scary
or
would
be
for
some
folks
but
i
like
to
see
anybody
get
the
better
o
me
i
go
armed
and
i
do
care
who
knows
it
some
o
them
drover
men
that
comes
from
canady
looks
as
if
they
did
care
what
they
did
but
i
look
right
in
the
eye
every
time
men
folks
is
brave
by
natur
said
the
widow
admiringly
you
know
how
tobin
would
let
his
fist
right
out
at
anybody
that
undertook
to
sass
him
days
if
he
got
disappointed
about
the
way
things
went
he
lay
out
in
and
ef
he
had
been
a
he
been
a
real
fightin
character
i
was
always
to
have
him
roused
for
all
he
was
so
willin
and
meechin
to
home
and
set
round
clever
as
anybody
my
susan
ellen
used
to
boss
him
same
the
kitten
when
she
was
four
year
old
i
got
a
kind
of
a
sideways
cant
to
my
nose
that
tobin
give
me
when
we
was
to
school
i
do
know
you
ever
noticed
it
said
briley
we
was
scufflin
as
lads
will
i
never
bore
him
no
kind
of
a
grudge
i
pitied
ye
when
he
was
taken
away
i
did
now
fanny
i
liked
tobin
and
i
liked
you
i
used
to
say
you
was
the
girl
to
school
lem
me
see
your
nose
is
all
straight
for
what
i
know
said
the
widow
gently
as
with
a
trace
of
coyness
she
gave
a
hasty
glance
i
do
know
but
what
is
warped
a
little
but
nothin
to
speak
of
you
got
real
nice
features
like
your
marm
folks
it
was
becoming
a
sentimental
occasion
and
jefferson
briley
felt
that
he
was
in
for
something
more
than
he
had
bargained
he
hurried
the
faltering
sorrel
horse
and
began
to
talk
of
the
weather
it
certainly
did
look
like
snow
and
he
was
tired
of
bumping
over
the
frozen
road
i
should
wonder
if
i
hired
a
hand
here
another
year
and
went
off
out
west
myself
to
see
the
country
why
how
you
talk
answered
the
widow
yes
pursued
jefferson
is
tamer
here
than
i
like
and
i
was
tellin
yesterday
i
got
to
know
this
road
most
too
well
like
to
go
out
an
ride
in
the
mountains
with
some
o
them
great
clipper
coaches
where
the
driver
do
know
one
minute
but
he
be
shot
dead
the
next
they
carry
an
awful
sight
o
gold
down
from
the
mines
i
expect
i
should
be
scairt
to
death
said
tobin
what
creatur
men
folks
be
to
like
such
things
well
i
do
declare
yes
explained
the
mild
little
man
there
sights
of
makes
a
livin
out
o
followin
them
coaches
an
an
robbin
clean
to
the
bone
your
money
your
life
and
he
flourished
his
stub
of
a
whip
over
the
sorrel
mare
landy
me
you
make
me
run
all
of
a
cold
creep
do
tell
heartenin
this
cold
day
i
shall
dream
bad
dreams
all
night
they
put
on
black
crape
over
their
heads
said
the
driver
mysteriously
nobody
knows
who
most
on
be
and
like
as
not
some
o
them
fellows
come
o
good
families
they
got
so
they
stop
the
cars
and
go
right
through
bold
as
brass
i
could
make
your
hair
stand
on
end
mis
tobin
i
could
i
hope
none
on
git
round
our
way
i
sure
said
fanny
tobin
i
do
want
to
see
none
on
in
their
crape
bunnits
comin
after
me
i
ai
goin
to
let
nobody
touch
a
hair
o
your
head
and
briley
moved
a
little
nearer
and
tucked
in
the
buffaloes
again
i
feel
considerable
warm
to
what
i
did
observed
the
widow
by
way
of
reward
there
i
used
to
have
my
fears
briley
resumed
with
an
inward
feeling
that
he
never
would
get
to
north
kilby
depot
a
single
man
but
you
see
i
had
nobody
but
myself
to
think
of
i
got
cousins
as
you
know
but
nothin
nearer
and
what
i
laid
up
would
soon
be
parted
out
and
well
i
suppose
some
folks
would
think
o
me
if
anything
was
to
happen
tobin
was
holding
her
cloud
over
her
face
the
wind
was
sharp
on
that
bit
of
open
road
but
she
gave
an
encouraging
sound
between
a
groan
and
a
chirp
would
be
like
nothin
to
me
not
to
see
you
drivin
by
she
said
after
a
minute
i
should
know
the
days
o
the
week
i
says
to
susan
ellen
last
week
i
was
sure
was
friday
and
she
said
no
thursday
but
next
minute
you
druv
by
and
headin
toward
north
kilby
so
we
found
i
was
right
i
got
to
be
a
featur
of
the
landscape
said
briley
plaintively
this
kind
o
weather
the
old
mare
and
me
we
wish
we
was
done
with
it
and
could
settle
down
kind
o
comfortable
i
been
lookin
this
good
while
as
i
drove
the
road
and
i
picked
me
out
a
piece
o
land
two
or
three
times
but
i
ca
abide
the
thought
buildin
plague

to
death
and
both

kilby
and
mis
deacon

to
the

the
passenger
i
kind
of

and
boardin
there
and
one
old
woman
mendin
and
the

settin

down

with
ye
lor
now
mis
tobin

said
briley
impatiently
you

you
covet
me
same
i
do
you
i
do
nuther
do
you
go
an
say
things
you
ca
stand
to
i
been
tryin
to
git
a
chance
to
put
in
a
word
with
you
ever
sence
well
i
expected
you
want
to
get
your
feelin
kind
calloused
after
losin
tobin
there
nobody
can
fill
his
place
said
the
widow
i
do
know
but
i
can
fight
for
ye
days
on
a
pinch
urged
jefferson
boldly
i
never
see
the
beat
o
you
men
fur
conceit
and
tobin
laughed
i
ai
goin
to
bother
with
ye
gone
half
the
time
as
you
be
carryin
on
with
your
mis
peaks
and
mis
ashes
i
dare
say
promised
yourself
to
both
on
twenty
times
i
hope
to
gracious
if
i
ever
breathed
a
word
to
none
on
protested
the
lover
ai
for
lack
o
opportunities
set
afore
me
nuther
and
then
briley
craftily
kept
silence
as
if
he
had
made
a
fair
proposal
and
expected
a
definite
reply
the
lady
of
his
choice
was
as
she
might
have
expressed
it
much
beat
about
as
she
soberly
thought
she
was
getting
along
in
years
and
must
put
up
with
jefferson
all
the
rest
of
the
time
it
was
not
likely
she
would
ever
have
the
chance
of
choosing
again
though
she
was
one
who
liked
variety
jefferson
was
much
to
look
at
but
he
was
pleasant
and
appeared
boyish
and
i
do
know
i
should
do
better
she
said
unconsciously
and
half
aloud
well
yes
jefferson
seein
it
you
but
we
both
on
us
kind
of
old
to
change
our
situation
fanny
tobin
gave
a
gentle
sigh
hooray
said
jefferson
i
was
scairt
you
meant
to
keep
me
here
a
half
an
hour
i
declare
i
more
pleased
than
i
on
an
i
expected
till
lately
to
die
a
single
man
have
been
a
shame
natur
said
tobin
with
confidence
i
do
see
how
you
held
out
so
long
with
solitary
i
hire
a
hand
to
drive
for
me
and
we
have
a
good
comfortable
winter
me
an
you
an
the
old
sorrel
i
been
promisin
of
her
a
rest
this
good
while
better
keep
her
a
steppin
urged
thrifty
fanny
stiffen
up
master
an
ye
come
spring
you
have
me
now
wo
ye
sartin
pleaded
jefferson
to
make
sure
you
ai
one
o
them
that
plays
with
a
man
feelin
say
right
out
you
have
me
i
i
shall
have
to
said
tobin
somewhat
mournfully
i
feel
for
mis
peak
an
mis
ash
pore
creatur
i
expect
they
be
hardshipped
they
always
been
an
may
have
kind
looked
forward
to
a
little
ease
but
one
on
would
be
left
lamentin
anyhow
and
she
gave
a
girlish
laugh
an
air
of
victory
animated
the
frame
of
tobin
she
felt
but
years
of
age
in
that
moment
she
made
plans
for
cutting
her
briley
hair
and
making
him
look
and
ambitious
then
she
wished
that
she
knew
for
certain
how
much
money
he
had
in
the
bank
not
that
it
would
make
any
difference
now
he
need
bluster
none
before
me
she
thought
gayly
he
harmless
as
a
fly
who
have
thought
we
done
such
a
piece
of
engineerin
when
we
started
out
inquired
the
dear
one
of
briley
heart
as
he
tenderly
helped
her
to
alight
at
susan
ellen
door
both
on
us
jest
the
least
grain
answered
the
lover
gim
me
a
good
smack
now
you
clever
creatur
and
so
they
parted
bailey
had
been
taken
on
the
road
in
spite
of
his
pistol
to
the
train
stopped
at
a
way
station
with
apparent
unwillingness
and
there
was
barely
time
for
one
elderly
passenger
to
be
hurried
on
board
before
a
sudden
jerk
threw
her
almost
off
her
unsteady
old
feet
and
we
moved
on
at
my
first
glance
i
saw
only
a
perturbed
old
countrywoman
laden
with
a
large
basket
and
a
heavy
bundle
tied
up
in
an
then
i
discovered
that
she
was
a
friend
of
mine
peet
who
lived
on
a
small
farm
several
miles
from
the
village
she
used
to
be
renowned
for
good
butter
and
fresh
eggs
and
the
earliest
cowslip
greens
in
fact
she
always
made
the
most
of
her
farm
slender
resources
but
it
was
some
time
since
i
had
seen
her
drive
by
from
market
in
her
ancient
wagon
the
brakeman
followed
her
into
the
crowded
car
also
carrying
a
number
of
packages
i
leaned
forward
and
asked
peet
to
sit
by
me
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
see
her
again
the
brakeman
seemed
relieved
and
smiled
as
he
tried
to
put
part
of
his
burden
into
the
rack
overhead
but
even
the
flowered
was
much
too
large
and
he
explained
that
he
would
take
care
of
everything
at
the
end
of
the
car
peet
was
not
large
herself
but
with
the
big
basket
and
the
and
some
possessions
of
my
own
we
had
very
little
spare
room
so
this
is
what
you
call
ridin
in
the
cars
well
i
do
declare
said
my
friend
as
soon
as
she
had
recovered
herself
a
little
she
looked
pale
and
as
if
she
had
been
in
tears
but
there
was
the
familiar
gleam
of
good
humor
in
her
tired
old
eyes
where
in
the
world
are
you
going
mrs
peet
i
asked
ca
be
you
ai
heared
about
me
dear
said
she
well
the
world
bigger
than
i
used
to
think
was
i
broke
up
was
the
only
thing
do
and
i
to
shrewsbury
to
shrewsbury
have
you
sold
the
farm
i
exclaimed
with
sorrow
and
surprise
peet
was
too
old
and
too
characteristic
to
be
suddenly
transplanted
from
her
native
soil
mine
the
place
her
pleasant
face
hardened
slightly
he
was
coaxed
an
into
signin
off
before
he
was
taken
away
son
of
his
sister
that
married
old
josh
peet
come
it
over
him
about
his
bein
past
work
and
how
he
do
for
him
like
an
own
son
an
we
owed
him
a
little
somethin
i
paid
off
everythin
but
that
an
was
fool
enough
to
leave
it
till
the
last
on
account
o
bein
a
relation
and
not
needin
his
pay
much
as
some
others
did
it
hurt
me
to
have
the
place
fall
into
other
hands
some
wanted
me
to
go
right
to
law
but
would
be
no
use
smarter
i
be
about
them
matters
you
see
he
got
my
name
on
the
paper
too
he
said
was
somethin
bein
responsible
for
the
taxes
we
was
scant
o
money
an
i
was
wore
out
with
watchin
an
being
broke
o
my
rest
after
my
tryin
hard
for
risin
year
to
provide
for
bein
past
work
here
i
be
dear
here
i
be
i
used
to
drive
things
smart
you
remember
but
we
was
fools
enough
in
to
put
about
everythin
we
had
safe
in
the
bank
into
that
spool
factory
that
come
to
nothin
but
i
tell
ye
i
could
ha
kept
myself
long
i
lived
if
i
could
ha
held
the
place
i
parted
with
most
o
the
woodland
if
coveted
it
he
was
welcome
to
that
what
might
keep
me
in
i
always
desired
to
travel
an
see
somethin
o
the
world
but
i
got
the
chance
now
when
i
do
value
it
no
great
shrewsbury
is
a
busy
pleasant
place
i
ventured
to
say
by
way
of
comfort
though
my
heart
was
filled
with
rage
at
the
trickery
of
isaiah
peet
who
had
always
looked
like
a
fox
and
behaved
like
one
shrewsbury
held
up
for
me
to
smile
at
said
the
poor
old
soul
but
i
tell
ye
dear
it
hard
to
go
an
live
miles
from
where
you
always
had
your
home
and
friends
it
may
divert
me
but
it
wo
be
home
you
might
as
well
set
out
one
o
my
old
on
the
beach
so
could
see
the
waves
come
in
there
would
be
no
please
to
it
where
are
you
going
to
live
in
shrewsbury
i
asked
presently
i
do
expect
to
stop
long
dear
creatur
i
year
old
and
peet
turned
to
look
at
me
with
pathetic
amusement
in
her
honest
wrinkled
face
i
said
right
out
to
before
a
roomful
o
the
neighbors
that
i
expected
it
of
him
to
git
me
home
bury
me
when
my
time
come
and
do
it
respectable
but
i
wanted
to
airn
my
livin
if
was
so
i
could
till
then
he
made
sly
talk
you
see
about
my
electin
to
leave
the
farm
and
go
some
o
my
own
folks
but
and
she
whispered
this
carefully
he
did
give
me
no
chance
to
stay
there
without
hurtin
my
pride
and
dependin
on
him
i
ai
said
that
to
many
folks
but
all
must
have
suspected
a
good
sight
on
had
money
of
though
and
they
do
like
to
do
nothin
but
take
his
part
an
be
pretty
soft
spoken
fear
it
git
to
his
ears
well
well
dear
we
let
it
be
bygones
and
not
think
of
it
no
more
but
i
saw
the
great
tears
roll
slowly
down
her
cheeks
and
she
pulled
her
bonnet
forward
impatiently
and
looked
the
other
way
there
looks
to
be
plenty
o
good
farmin
land
in
this
part
o
the
country
she
said
a
minute
later
where
be
we
now
see
them
handsome
farm
buildin
he
must
be
a
man
but
i
had
to
tell
my
companion
that
we
were
still
within
the
borders
of
the
old
town
where
we
had
both
been
born
peet
gave
a
pleased
little
laugh
like
a
girl
i
expectin
shrewsbury
to
pop
up
any
minute
i
feared
to
be
kerried
right
by
i
never
aboard
of
the
cars
before
but
i
so
often
thought
about
i
do
know
but
it
seems
natural
ai
it
jest
like
flyin
through
the
air
i
ca
catch
holt
to
see
nothin
land
and
here
my
old
cat
goin
too
and
never
mistrustin
i
ai
told
you
that
i
fetched
her
is
she
in
that
basket
i
inquired
with
interest
yis
dear
truth
was
i
to
have
her
put
out
o
the
misery
o
movin
an
spoke
to
one
o
the
barnes
boys
an
he
promised
me
all
fair
but
he
there
in
season
an
i
kind
o
made
excuse
to
myself
to
fetch
her
along
she
an
old
creatur
like
me
an
i
can
make
shift
to
keep
her
some
way
or
there
probably
mice
where
we
goin
an
she
a
proper
mouser
that
can
about
keep
herself
if
there
any
sort
o
chance
will
be
somethin
o
home
to
see
her
goin
an
comin
but
i
expect
we
both
on
us
goin
to
miss
our
old
haunts
i
love
to
know
what
kind
o
mousin
there
goin
to
be
for
me
you
must
worry
i
answered
with
all
the
bravery
and
assurance
that
i
could
muster
your
niece
will
be
thankful
to
have
you
with
her
is
she
one
of
winn
daughters
oh
no
they
ai
able
it
sister
wayland
darter
isabella
that
married
the
overseer
of
the
i
ai
seen
her
since
just
after
she
was
married
but
i
turned
to
her
first
because
i
knew
she
was
best
able
to
have
me
and
then
i
can
see
just
how
the
other
girls
is
situated
and
make
me
some
kind
of
a
plot
i
wrote
to
isabella
though
she
ambitious
and
said
was
so
i
got
to
ask
to
come
an
make
her
a
visit
an
she
wrote
back
she
would
be
glad
to
have
me
but
she
did
write
right
off
and
her
letter
was
scented
up
dreadful
strong
with
some
sort
o
essence
and
i
do
feel
heartened
about
no
great
of
a
welcome
but
there
i
got
eyes
an
i
can
see
is
when
i
git
is
sister
winn
gals
ai
married
an
they
always
boarded
an
worked
in
the
shop
on
trimmin
isabella
well
off
she
had
some
means
from
her
father
sister
i
thought
it
all
over
by
night
an
day
an
i
recalled
that
our
folks
kept
sister
wayland
folks
all
one
winter
when
he
failed
up
and
got
into
trouble
i
reckonin
on
sendin
over
an
the
winn
gals
to
come
and
see
me
and
advise
perhaps
some
on
may
know
of
somebody
that
take
me
for
what
help
i
can
give
about
house
or
some
clever
folks
that
have
been
lookin
for
a
smart
cat
any
ways
no
i
do
know
i
could
let
her
go
to
strangers
there
was
two
or
three
o
the
folks
round
home
that
acted
real
towards
me
an
urged
me
to
come
an
winter
with
continued
the
exile
an
this
mornin
i
wished
i
agreed
to
was
so
hard
to
break
away
but
now
it
done
i
feel
ever
it
best
i
could
bear
to
live
right
in
sight
o
the
old
place
and
come
spring
i
should
of
nothing
ondertakes
to
do
with
the
land
oh
dear
sakes
now
it
comes
hard
with
me
not
to
have
had
no
when
i
was
young
an
workin
hard
and
into
everything
i
felt
kind
of
free
an
superior
to
them
that
was
so
blessed
an
their
houses
cluttered
up
from
mornin
till
night
but
i
tell
ye
it
comes
home
to
me
now
i
be
most
willin
to
own
to
even
mean
he
is
but
i
tell
ye
i
took
it
out
of
him
he
was
a
grown
man
if
there
any
virtue
in
of
him
folks
do
look
like
wild
creatur
for
nothin
got
fox
blood
in
him
is
his
misfortune
his
own
mother
always
favored
the
looks
of
an
old
fox
true
the
world
she
was
a
poor
tool
a
poor
tool
i
we
ought
to
blame
him
same
we
do
i
always
been
a
master
proud
woman
if
i
was
riz
among
the
pastures
peet
added
half
to
herself
there
was
no
use
in
saying
much
to
her
she
was
conscious
of
little
beside
her
own
thoughts
and
the
smouldering
excitement
caused
by
this
great
crisis
in
her
simple
existence
yet
the
atmosphere
of
her
loneliness
uncertainty
and
sorrow
was
so
touching
that
after
scolding
again
at
her
nephew
treachery
and
finding
the
tears
come
fast
to
my
eyes
as
she
talked
i
looked
intently
out
of
the
car
window
and
tried
to
think
what
could
be
done
for
the
poor
soul
she
was
one
of
the
people
and
i
hated
to
have
her
go
away
but
even
if
she
could
keep
her
home
she
would
soon
be
too
feeble
to
live
there
alone
and
some
definite
plan
must
be
made
for
her
comfort
farms
in
that
neighborhood
were
not
valuable
perhaps
through
the
agency
of
the
law
and
quite
in
secret
isaiah
peet
could
be
forced
to
give
up
his
unrighteous
claim
perhaps
too
the
winn
girls
who
were
really
no
longer
young
might
have
saved
something
and
would
come
home
again
but
it
was
easy
to
make
such
pictures
in
one
mind
and
i
must
do
what
i
could
through
other
people
for
i
was
just
leaving
home
for
a
long
time
i
wondered
sadly
about
peet
future
and
the
ambitious
isabella
and
the
favorite
sister
winn
daughters
to
whom
with
all
their
kindliness
of
heart
the
care
of
so
old
and
perhaps
so
dependent
an
aunt
might
seem
impossible
the
truth
about
life
in
shrewsbury
would
soon
be
known
more
than
half
the
short
journey
was
already
past
to
my
great
pleasure
my
now
began
to
forget
her
own
troubles
in
looking
about
her
she
was
an
alert
quickly
interested
old
soul
and
this
was
a
bit
of
neutral
ground
between
the
farm
and
shrewsbury
where
she
was
unattached
and
irresponsible
she
had
lived
through
the
last
tragic
moments
of
her
old
life
and
felt
a
certain
relief
and
shrewsbury
might
be
as
far
away
as
the
other
side
of
the
rocky
mountains
for
all
the
consciousness
she
had
of
its
real
existence
she
was
simply
a
traveler
for
the
time
being
and
began
to
comment
with
delicious
phrases
and
shrewd
understanding
of
human
nature
on
two
or
three
persons
near
us
who
attracted
her
attention
where
do
you
they
be
all
goin
she
asked
contemptuously
there
ai
none
on
but
what
looks
kind
o
respectable
warrant
they
left
work
to
home
they
ought
to
be
doin
i
knowed
if
ever
i
stopped
to
think
that
cars
was
hived
full
o
folks
run
to
an
fro
for
nothin
but
these
ca
be
quite
up
to
the
average
be
they
some
on
real
guess
they
shoved
out
o
the
last
place
an
goin
to
try
the
next
one
like
me
i
suppose
you
want
to
say
jest
see
that
flauntin
old
that
looks
like
a
stopped
clock
there
everybody
ca
be
o
one
goodness
even
preachers
i
was
glad
to
have
peet
amused
and
we
were
as
cheerful
as
we
could
be
for
a
few
minutes
she
said
earnestly
that
she
hoped
to
be
forgiven
for
such
talk
but
there
were
some
kinds
of
folks
in
the
cars
that
she
never
had
seen
before
but
when
the
conductor
came
to
take
her
ticket
she
relapsed
into
her
first
state
of
mind
and
was
at
a
loss
you
have
to
look
after
me
dear
when
we
get
to
shrewsbury
she
said
after
we
had
spent
some
distracted
moments
in
hunting
for
the
ticket
and
the
cat
had
almost
escaped
from
the
basket
and
the
had
become
untied
and
all
its
miscellaneous
contents
scattered
about
our
laps
and
the
floor
it
was
a
touching
collection
of
the
last
odds
and
ends
of
peet
housekeeping
some
battered
books
and
singed
holders
for
flatirons
and
the
faded
little
shoulder
shawl
that
i
had
seen
her
wear
many
a
day
about
her
bent
shoulders
there
were
her
old
tin
spilling
all
its
matches
and
a
for
brushing
up
ashes
and
her
almanac
it
was
most
pathetic
to
see
these
poor
trifles
out
of
their
places
at
last
the
ticket
was
found
in
her
woolen
glove
where
her
stiff
hand
had
grown
used
to
the
feeling
of
it
i
should
wonder
now
if
i
come
to
like
living
over
to
shrewsbury
she
insisted
turning
to
me
with
a
hopeful
eager
look
to
see
if
i
differed
you
wo
be
so
tough
for
me
as
if
i
always
felt
it
lurking
within
me
to
go
off
some
day
or
an
see
how
other
folks
did
things
i
do
know
but
what
the
winn
gals
have
laid
up
somethin
sufficient
for
us
to
take
a
house
with
the
little
mite
i
got
by
me
i
might
keep
house
for
us
all
o
round
in
other
folks
houses
that
i
ai
never
been
demeaned
to
but
i
dare
say
i
should
find
it
pleasant
in
some
ways
town
folks
has
got
the
upper
hand
o
country
folks
but
with
all
their
work
an
pride
they
ca
make
a
dandelion
i
do
know
the
times
when
i
set
out
to
wash
monday
mornin
an
tied
out
the
line
betwixt
the
old
tree
and
the
corner
o
the
barn
an
thought
i
be
with
the
same
kind
o
week
work
right
over
again
i
wonder
kind
o
if
i
could
git
out
of
it
noways
an
now
here
i
be
out
of
it
and
an
uprooteder
creatur
never
stood
on
the
airth
just
as
i
got
to
feel
i
had
somethin
ahead
come
that
business
there
you
know
he
never
was
a
forehanded
man
his
health
was
slim
and
he
got
discouraged
pretty
nigh
before
ever
he
begun
i
hope
he
do
know
i
turned
out
o
the
old
place
well
off
do
the
right
thing
by
ye
says
he
but
my
i
turned
hot
all
over
when
i
found
out
what
i
put
my
name
to
me
that
had
always
counted
a
smart
woman
i
did
undertake
to
read
it
over
but
i
could
sense
it
i
told
all
the
folks
so
when
they
laid
it
off
on
to
me
some
but
is
awful
tedious
readin
and
my
head
felt
that
day
as
if
the
works
was
gone
i
ai
goin
to
sag
on
to
nobody
she
assured
me
eagerly
as
the
train
rushed
along
i
got
more
work
in
me
now
than
folks
expects
at
my
age
i
may
be
use
to
isabella
she
got
a
family
an
i
take
right
holt
in
the
kitchen
or
with
the
little
gals
she
had
four
on
last
i
heared
isabella
was
never
one
that
liked
little
gals
i
do
know
now
but
what
they
must
be
about
grown
time
doos
slip
away
so
i
expect
i
shall
look
outlandish
to
but
there
everybody
knows
me
to
home
an
nobody
knows
me
to
shrewsbury
make
a
mite
o
difference
if
i
take
holt
willin
i
hoped
as
i
looked
at
peet
that
she
would
never
be
persuaded
to
cast
off
the
gathered
brown
silk
bonnet
and
the
plain
shawl
that
she
had
worn
so
many
years
but
isabella
might
think
it
best
to
insist
upon
more
modern
fashions
peet
suggested
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
little
consequence
that
she
had
kept
it
in
mind
to
buy
some
mourning
but
there
were
other
things
to
be
thought
of
first
and
so
she
had
let
it
go
until
winter
any
way
or
until
she
should
be
fairly
settled
in
shrewsbury
are
your
nieces
expecting
you
by
this
train
i
was
moved
to
ask
though
with
all
the
good
soul
ready
talk
and
appealing
manner
i
could
hardly
believe
that
she
was
going
to
shrewsbury
for
more
than
a
visit
it
seemed
as
if
she
must
return
to
the
worn
old
farmhouse
over
by
the
she
answered
that
one
of
the
barnes
boys
had
written
a
letter
for
her
the
day
before
and
there
was
evidently
little
uneasiness
about
her
first
reception
we
drew
near
the
junction
where
i
must
leave
her
within
a
mile
of
the
town
the
cat
was
clawing
indignantly
at
the
basket
and
her
mistress
grew
as
impatient
of
the
car
she
began
to
look
very
old
and
pale
my
poor
and
said
that
she
felt
dizzy
going
so
fast
presently
the
friendly
young
brakeman
came
along
bringing
the
and
other
possessions
and
insisted
upon
taking
the
alarmed
cat
beside
in
spite
of
an
aggressive
paw
that
had
worked
its
way
through
the
wicker
prison
peet
watched
her
goods
disappear
with
suspicious
eyes
and
clutched
her
as
if
it
might
be
all
that
she
could
save
then
she
anxiously
got
to
her
feet
much
too
soon
and
when
i
said
to
her
at
the
car
door
she
was
ready
to
cry
i
pointed
to
the
car
which
she
was
to
take
next
on
the
branch
line
of
railway
and
i
assured
her
that
it
was
only
a
few
minutes
ride
to
shrewsbury
and
that
i
felt
certain
she
would
find
somebody
waiting
the
sight
of
that
worn
thin
figure
adventuring
alone
across
the
platform
gave
my
heart
a
sharp
pang
as
the
train
carried
me
away
some
of
the
passengers
who
sat
near
asked
me
about
my
old
friend
with
great
sympathy
after
she
had
gone
there
was
a
look
of
tragedy
about
her
and
indeed
it
had
been
impossible
not
to
get
a
good
deal
of
her
history
as
she
talked
straight
on
in
the
same
tone
when
we
stopped
at
a
station
as
if
the
train
were
going
at
full
speed
and
some
of
her
remarks
caused
pity
and
amusements
by
turns
at
the
last
minute
she
said
with
deep
why
i
have
asked
a
word
about
your
folks
but
you
ought
to
excuse
such
an
old
stray
hen
as
i
be
in
the
spring
i
was
driving
by
on
what
the
old
people
of
my
native
town
call
the
road
and
the
sight
of
peet
former
home
brought
our
former
journey
freshly
to
my
mind
i
had
last
heard
from
her
just
after
she
got
to
shrewsbury
when
she
had
sent
me
a
message
have
you
ever
heard
how
she
got
on
i
eagerly
asked
my
companion
did
i
tell
you
that
i
met
her
in
shrewsbury
high
street
one
day
i
was
answered
she
seemed
perfectly
delighted
with
everything
her
nieces
have
laid
up
a
good
bit
of
money
and
are
soon
to
leave
the
mill
and
most
thankful
to
have
old
peet
with
them
somebody
told
me
that
they
wished
to
buy
the
farm
here
and
come
back
to
live
but
she
would
hear
of
it
and
thought
they
would
miss
too
many
privileges
she
has
been
going
to
concerts
and
lectures
this
winter
and
insists
that
isaiah
did
her
a
good
turn
we
both
laughed
my
own
heart
was
filled
with
joy
for
the
uncertain
lonely
face
of
this
homeless
old
woman
had
often
haunted
me
the
little
house
did
certainly
look
dreary
and
a
whole
lifetime
of
patient
toil
had
left
few
traces
the
tree
was
in
full
bloom
however
and
gave
a
welcome
gaiety
to
the
deserted
a
little
way
beyond
we
met
isaiah
peet
the
prosperous
who
had
cheated
the
old
woman
of
her
own
i
fancied
that
he
looked
somewhat
ashamed
as
he
recognized
us
to
my
surprise
he
stopped
his
horse
in
most
social
fashion
old
aunt
peet
passed
away
he
informed
me
briskly
she
had
a
shock
and
went
right
off
sudden
yisterday
i
about
now
tendin
to
the
funeral
she
extry
smart
they
say
all
winter
out
to
meetin
last
sabbath
never
enjoyed
herself
so
complete
as
she
has
this
past
month
she
a
very
woman
her
folks
was
glad
to
have
her
there
and
give
her
every
attention
the
place
here
never
was
good
for
nothin
the
old
uncle
you
know
he
wore
hisself
out
tryin
to
make
a
livin
off
from
it
there
was
an
ostentatious
sympathy
and
excitement
from
bad
news
which
were
quite
lost
upon
us
and
we
did
not
linger
to
hear
much
more
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
i
had
known
peet
better
than
any
one
else
had
known
her
i
had
counted
upon
seeing
her
again
and
hearing
her
own
account
of
shrewsbury
life
its
pleasures
and
its
limitations
i
wondered
what
had
become
of
the
cat
and
the
contents
of
the
faded
white
rose
being
a
new
englander
it
is
natural
that
i
should
first
speak
about
the
weather
only
the
middle
of
june
the
green
fields
and
blue
sky
and
bright
sun
with
a
touch
of
northern
mountain
wind
blowing
straight
toward
the
sea
could
make
such
a
day
and
that
is
all
one
can
say
about
it
we
were
driving
seaward
through
a
part
of
the
country
which
has
been
least
changed
in
the
last
thirty
years
among
farms
which
have
been
won
from
swampy
lowland
and
rocky
hillsides
where
the
forests
wall
in
the
fields
and
send
their
outposts
year
by
year
farther
into
the
pastures
there
is
a
year
or
two
in
the
history
of
these
pastures
before
they
have
arrived
at
the
dignity
of
being
called
woodland
and
yet
are
too
much
shaded
and
overgrown
by
young
trees
to
give
proper
pasturage
when
they
made
delightful
harbors
for
the
small
wild
creatures
which
yet
remain
and
for
wild
flowers
and
berries
here
you
send
an
astonished
rabbit
scurrying
to
his
burrow
and
there
you
startle
yourself
with
a
partridge
who
seems
to
get
the
best
of
the
encounter
sometimes
you
see
a
hen
partridge
and
her
brood
of
chickens
crossing
your
path
with
an
air
of
comfortable
security
as
you
drive
along
the
narrow
grassy
road
you
see
many
charming
sights
and
delightful
nooks
on
either
hand
where
the
young
trees
spring
out
of
a
turf
that
carpets
the
ground
like
velvet
toward
the
east
and
the
quaint
fishing
village
of
ogunquit
i
find
the
most
delightful
woodland
roads
there
is
little
left
of
the
large
timber
which
once
filled
the
region
but
much
young
growth
and
there
are
hundreds
of
acres
of
cleared
land
and
where
the
forests
are
springing
fast
and
covering
the
country
once
more
as
if
they
had
no
idea
of
losing
in
their
war
with
civilization
and
the
intruding
white
settler
the
pine
woods
and
the
indians
seem
to
be
next
of
kin
and
the
former
owners
of
this
corner
of
new
england
are
the
only
proper
figures
to
paint
into
such
landscapes
the
twilight
under
tall
pines
seems
to
be
untenanted
and
to
lack
something
at
first
sight
as
if
one
opened
the
door
of
an
empty
house
a
farmer
passing
through
with
his
axe
is
but
an
intruder
and
children
straying
home
from
school
give
one
a
feeling
of
solicitude
at
their
unprotectedness
the
pine
woods
are
the
red
man
house
and
it
may
be
hazardous
even
yet
for
the
gray
farmhouses
to
stand
so
near
the
eaves
of
the
forest
i
have
noticed
a
distrust
of
the
deep
woods
among
elderly
people
which
was
something
more
than
a
fear
of
losing
their
way
it
was
a
feeling
of
defenselessness
against
some
unrecognized
but
malicious
influence
driving
through
the
long
woodland
way
shaded
and
chilly
when
you
are
out
of
the
sun
across
the
great
works
river
and
its
pretty
intervale
across
the
short
bridges
of
brown
brooks
delayed
now
and
then
by
the
sight
of
ripe
strawberries
in
sunny
spots
by
the
roadside
one
comes
to
a
higher
open
country
where
farm
joins
farm
and
the
cleared
fields
lie
all
along
the
highway
while
the
woods
are
pushed
back
a
good
distance
on
either
hand
the
wooded
hills
bleak
here
and
there
with
granite
ledges
rise
beyond
the
houses
are
beside
the
road
with
green
and
large
barns
almost
empty
now
and
with
wide
doors
standing
open
as
if
they
were
already
expecting
the
hay
crop
to
be
brought
in
the
tall
green
grass
is
waving
in
the
fields
as
the
wind
goes
over
and
there
is
a
fragrance
of
whiteweed
and
ripe
strawberries
and
clover
blowing
through
the
sunshiny
barns
with
their
lean
sides
and
their
festoons
of
brown
dusty
cobwebs
dull
comfortable
creatures
they
appear
to
imaginative
eyes
waiting
hungrily
for
their
yearly
meal
the
are
teasing
their
sleepy
shapes
like
the
birds
which
flit
about
great
beasts
gay
movable
irreverent
almost
derisive
those
barn
swallows
fly
to
and
fro
in
the
still
clear
air
the
noise
of
our
wheels
brings
fewer
faces
to
the
windows
than
usual
and
we
lose
the
pleasure
of
seeing
some
of
our
friends
who
are
apt
to
be
looking
out
and
to
whom
we
like
to
say
some
funeral
must
be
taking
place
or
perhaps
the
women
may
have
gone
out
into
the
fields
it
is
and
and
already
we
have
seen
some
of
the
younger
women
at
work
among
the
corn
and
potatoes
one
sight
will
be
charming
to
remember
on
a
green
hillside
sloping
to
the
west
near
one
of
the
houses
a
thin
little
girl
was
working
away
lustily
with
a
big
hoe
on
a
patch
of
land
perhaps
fifty
feet
by
twenty
there
were
all
sorts
of
things
growing
there
as
if
a
fancy
had
made
the
choice
straight
rows
of
turnips
and
carrots
and
beets
a
little
of
everything
one
might
say
but
the
only
touch
of
color
was
from
a
long
border
of
useful
sage
in
full
bloom
of
dull
blue
on
the
upper
side
i
am
sure
this
was
called
katy
or
by
the
elder
members
of
the
family
one
can
imagine
how
the
young
creature
had
planned
it
in
the
spring
and
persuaded
the
men
to
plough
and
harrow
it
and
since
then
had
stoutly
done
all
the
work
herself
and
meant
to
send
the
harvest
of
the
piece
to
market
and
pocket
her
honest
gains
as
they
came
in
for
some
great
end
she
was
as
thin
as
a
grasshopper
this
busy
little
gardener
and
hardly
turned
to
give
us
a
glance
as
we
drove
slowly
up
the
hill
close
by
the
sun
will
brown
and
dry
her
like
a
spear
of
grass
on
that
hot
slope
but
a
spark
of
fine
spirit
is
in
the
small
body
and
i
wish
her
a
famous
crop
i
hate
to
say
that
the
piece
looked
backward
all
except
the
sage
and
that
it
was
a
heavy
bit
of
land
for
the
clumsy
hoe
to
pick
at
the
only
puzzle
is
what
she
proposes
to
do
with
so
long
a
row
of
sage
yet
there
may
be
a
large
family
with
a
downfall
of
measles
yet
ahead
and
she
does
not
mean
to
be
caught
without
along
this
road
every
one
of
the
old
farmhouses
has
at
least
one
tall
bush
of
white
roses
by
the
door
a
most
lovely
sight
with
buds
and
blossoms
and
unvexed
green
leaves
i
wish
that
i
knew
the
history
of
them
and
whence
the
first
bush
was
brought
perhaps
from
england
itself
like
a
red
rose
that
i
know
in
kittery
and
the
new
shoots
from
the
root
were
given
to
one
neighbor
after
another
all
through
the
district
the
bushes
are
slender
but
they
grow
tall
without
climbing
against
the
wall
and
sway
to
and
fro
in
the
wind
with
a
grace
of
youth
and
an
inexpressible
charm
of
beauty
how
many
lovers
must
have
picked
them
on
sunday
evenings
in
all
the
bygone
years
and
carried
them
along
the
roads
or
by
the
pasture
footpaths
hiding
them
clumsily
under
their
sunday
coats
if
they
caught
sight
of
any
one
coming
here
too
where
the
sea
wind
nips
many
a
young
life
before
its
prime
how
often
the
white
roses
have
been
put
into
paler
hands
and
withered
there
in
spite
of
the
serene
and
placid
look
of
the
old
houses
one
who
has
always
known
them
can
not
help
thinking
of
the
sorrows
of
these
farms
and
their
almost
undiverted
toil
near
the
little
gardener
plot
we
turned
from
the
main
road
and
drove
through
lately
cleared
woodland
up
to
an
old
farmhouse
high
on
a
ledgy
hill
whence
there
is
a
fine
view
of
the
country
seaward
and
mountainward
there
were
few
of
the
once
large
household
left
there
only
the
old
farmer
who
was
crippled
by
war
wounds
active
cheerful
man
that
he
was
once
and
two
young
orphan
children
there
has
been
much
hard
work
spent
on
the
place
every
generation
has
toiled
from
youth
to
age
without
being
able
to
make
much
beyond
a
living
the
dollars
that
can
be
saved
are
but
few
and
sickness
and
death
have
often
brought
their
bitter
cost
the
mistress
of
the
farm
was
helpless
for
many
years
through
all
the
summers
and
winters
she
sat
in
her
pillowed
in
the
plain
room
she
could
watch
the
lane
and
beyond
it
a
little
way
across
the
fields
were
the
woods
besides
these
only
the
clouds
in
the
sky
she
could
not
lift
her
food
to
her
mouth
she
could
not
be
her
husband
working
partner
she
never
went
into
another
house
to
see
her
works
and
ways
but
sat
there
aching
and
tired
vexed
by
flies
and
by
heat
and
isolated
in
long
storms
yet
the
whole
countryside
neighbored
her
with
true
affection
her
spirit
grew
stronger
as
her
body
grew
weaker
and
the
doctors
who
grieved
because
they
could
do
so
little
with
their
skill
were
never
confronted
by
that
malady
of
the
spirit
a
desire
for
ease
and
laziness
which
makes
the
soundest
of
bodies
useless
and
complaining
the
thought
of
her
blooms
in
one
mind
like
the
whitest
of
flowers
it
makes
one
braver
and
more
thankful
to
remember
the
simple
faith
and
patience
with
which
she
bore
her
pain
and
trouble
how
often
she
must
have
said
i
wish
i
could
do
something
for
you
in
return
when
she
was
doing
a
thousand
times
more
than
if
like
her
neighbors
she
followed
the
simple
round
of
daily
life
she
was
doing
constant
kindness
by
her
example
but
nobody
can
tell
the
woe
of
her
long
days
and
nights
the
solitude
of
her
spirit
as
she
was
being
lifted
by
such
hard
ways
to
the
knowledge
of
higher
truth
and
experience
think
of
her
pain
when
one
after
another
her
children
fell
ill
and
died
and
she
could
not
tend
them
and
now
in
the
same
worn
chair
where
she
lived
and
slept
sat
her
husband
helpless
too
thinking
of
her
and
missing
her
more
than
if
she
had
been
sometimes
away
from
home
like
other
women
even
a
stranger
would
miss
her
in
the
house
there
sat
the
old
farmer
looking
down
the
lane
in
his
turn
bearing
his
afflictions
with
a
patient
sternness
that
may
have
been
born
of
watching
his
wife
serenity
there
was
a
rose
lying
within
his
reach
some
days
nobody
came
up
the
lane
and
the
wild
birds
that
ventured
near
the
house
and
the
clouds
that
blew
over
were
his
only
entertainment
he
had
a
fine
face
of
the
older
new
england
type
and
a
type
that
is
fast
passing
away
he
might
have
been
a
cumberland
dalesman
such
were
his
dignity
and
and
english
soberness
of
manner
his
large
frame
was
built
for
hard
work
for
lifting
great
weights
and
pushing
his
plough
through
land
we
felt
at
home
together
and
each
knew
many
things
that
the
other
did
of
earlier
days
and
of
losses
that
had
come
with
time
i
remembered
coming
to
the
old
house
often
in
my
childhood
it
was
in
this
very
farm
lane
that
i
first
saw
anemones
and
learned
what
to
call
them
after
we
drove
away
this
crippled
man
must
have
thought
a
long
time
about
my
elders
and
betters
as
if
he
were
reading
their
story
out
of
a
book
i
suppose
he
has
hauled
many
a
stick
of
timber
pine
down
for
and
gone
through
the
village
so
early
in
the
winter
morning
that
i
waking
in
my
warm
bed
only
heard
the
sleds
creak
through
the
frozen
snow
as
the
slow
oxen
plodded
by
near
the
house
a
trout
brook
comes
plashing
over
the
ledges
at
one
place
there
is
a
most
exquisite
waterfall
to
which
neither
brush
nor
writer
pen
can
do
justice
the
sunlight
falls
through
flickering
leaves
into
the
deep
glen
and
makes
the
foam
whiter
and
the
brook
more
you
can
hear
the
merry
noise
of
it
all
night
all
day
in
the
house
a
little
way
above
the
farmstead
it
comes
through
marshy
ground
which
i
fear
has
been
the
cause
of
much
illness
and
sorrow
to
the
poor
troubled
family
i
had
a
thrill
of
pain
as
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
brook
was
mocking
at
all
that
trouble
with
all
its
wild
carelessness
and
loud
laughter
as
it
hurried
away
down
the
glen
when
we
had
said
and
were
turning
the
horses
away
there
suddenly
appeared
in
a
footpath
that
led
down
from
one
of
the
green
hills
the
young
grandchild
just
coming
home
from
school
she
was
as
quick
as
a
bird
and
as
shy
in
her
little
pink
gown
and
balanced
herself
on
one
foot
like
a
flower
the
brother
was
the
elder
of
the
two
orphans
he
was
the
old
man
delight
and
dependence
by
day
while
his
hired
man
was
afield
the
sober
country
boy
had
learned
to
wait
and
tend
and
the
young
people
were
indeed
a
joy
in
that
lonely
household
there
was
no
sign
that
they
ever
played
like
other
children
no
in
the
yard
no
doll
no
bits
of
broken
crockery
in
order
on
a
rock
they
had
learned
a
fashion
of
life
from
their
elders
and
already
could
lift
and
carry
their
share
of
the
burdens
of
life
it
was
a
country
of
wild
flowers
the
last
of
the
columbines
were
clinging
to
the
hillsides
down
in
the
small
fenced
meadows
belonging
to
the
farm
were
meadow
rue
just
coming
in
flower
and
red
and
white
clover
the
golden
buttercups
were
thicker
than
the
grass
while
many
mulleins
were
standing
straight
and
slender
among
the
pine
stumps
with
their
first
blossoms
atop
rudbeckias
had
found
their
way
in
and
appeared
more
than
ever
like
bold
foreigners
their
names
should
be
translated
into
country
speech
and
the
children
ought
to
call
them
by
way
of
relating
them
to
and
the
pasture
grass
was
green
and
thick
after
the
plentiful
rains
and
the
busy
cattle
took
little
notice
of
us
as
they
browsed
steadily
and
tinkled
their
pleasant
bells
looking
off
the
smooth
round
back
of
great
hill
caught
the
sunlight
with
its
fields
of
young
grain
and
all
the
long
wooded
slopes
and
valleys
were
fresh
and
fair
in
the
june
weather
away
toward
the
blue
new
hampshire
hills
on
the
northern
horizon
seaward
stood
agamenticus
dark
with
its
pitch
pines
and
the
far
sea
itself
blue
and
calm
ruled
the
uneven
country
with
its
unchangeable
line
out
on
the
white
rose
road
again
we
saw
more
of
the
than
ever
and
now
and
then
a
carefully
tended
flower
garden
always
delightful
to
see
and
think
about
these
are
not
made
by
merely
looking
through
a
florist
catalogue
and
ordering
this
or
that
new
seedling
and
a
proper
selection
of
bulbs
or
shrubs
everything
in
a
country
garden
has
its
history
and
personal
association
the
old
bushes
the
perennials
are
apt
to
have
most
tender
relationship
with
the
hands
that
planted
them
long
ago
there
is
a
constant
exchange
of
such
treasures
between
the
neighbors
and
in
the
spring
slips
and
cuttings
may
be
seen
rooting
on
the
window
ledges
while
the
house
plants
give
endless
work
all
winter
long
since
they
need
careful
protection
against
frost
in
long
nights
of
the
severe
weather
a
woman
brings
back
from
every
one
of
her
infrequent
journeys
some
treasure
of
or
a
huge
miscellaneous
nosegay
time
to
work
in
the
little
plot
of
is
hardly
won
by
the
busy
mistress
of
the
farmhouse
the
most
appealing
collection
of
flowering
plants
and
vines
that
i
ever
saw
was
in
virginia
once
above
the
exquisite
valley
spanned
by
the
natural
bridge
a
valley
far
too
little
known
or
praised
i
had
noticed
an
old
log
house
as
i
learned
to
know
the
outlook
from
the
picturesque
hotel
and
was
sure
that
it
must
give
a
charming
view
from
its
perch
on
the
summit
of
a
hill
one
day
i
went
there
one
april
day
when
the
whole
landscape
was
full
of
color
from
the
budding
trees
and
before
i
could
look
at
the
view
i
caught
sight
of
some
rare
vines
already
in
leaf
about
the
dilapidated
walls
of
the
cabin
then
across
the
low
paling
i
saw
the
brilliant
colors
of
tulips
and
daffodils
there
were
many
in
fact
the
whole
top
of
the
hill
was
a
flower
garden
once
well
cared
for
and
carefully
ordered
it
was
all
the
work
of
an
old
woman
of
descent
who
had
been
busy
with
the
cares
of
life
and
a
very
hard
worker
yet
i
was
told
that
to
gratify
her
love
for
flowers
she
would
often
go
afoot
many
miles
over
those
rough
virginia
roads
with
a
root
or
cutting
from
her
own
garden
to
barter
for
a
new
rose
or
a
brighter
blossom
of
some
sort
with
which
she
would
return
in
triumph
i
fancied
that
sometimes
she
had
to
go
by
night
on
these
charming
quests
i
could
see
her
small
figure
setting
forth
down
the
steep
path
when
she
had
a
good
conscience
toward
her
housekeeping
and
the
children
were
in
order
to
be
left
i
am
sure
that
her
friends
thought
of
her
when
they
were
away
from
home
and
could
bring
her
an
offering
of
something
rare
alas
she
had
grown
too
old
and
feeble
to
care
for
her
dear
blossoms
any
longer
and
had
been
forced
to
go
to
live
with
a
married
son
i
dare
say
that
she
was
thinking
of
her
garden
that
very
day
and
wondering
if
this
plant
or
that
were
not
in
bloom
and
perhaps
had
a
heartache
at
the
thought
that
her
tenants
the
careless
colored
children
might
tread
the
young
shoots
of
peony
and
rose
and
make
havoc
in
the
it
was
an
uncommon
collection
made
by
years
of
patient
toil
and
i
thought
of
that
deserted
southern
garden
as
i
followed
my
own
new
england
road
the
were
in
gay
bloom
all
along
the
way
almost
every
house
had
some
flowers
before
it
sometimes
carefully
fenced
about
by
stakes
and
barrel
staves
from
the
miscreant
hens
and
chickens
which
lurked
everywhere
and
liked
a
good
scratch
and
fluffing
in
soft
earth
this
year
as
well
as
any
other
the
world
seemed
full
of
young
life
there
were
calves
tethered
in
pleasant
shady
spots
and
puppies
and
kittens
adventuring
from
the
doorways
the
trees
were
full
of
birds
bobolinks
and
and
and
golden
robins
and
sometimes
a
thrush
for
the
afternoon
was
wearing
late
we
passed
the
spring
which
once
marked
the
boundary
where
three
towns
met
berwick
york
and
wells
a
famous
spot
in
the
early
settlement
of
the
country
but
many
of
its
old
traditions
are
now
forgotten
one
of
the
omnipresent
regicides
of
charles
the
first
is
believed
to
have
hidden
himself
for
a
long
time
under
a
great
rock
close
by
the
story
runs
that
he
made
his
miserable
home
in
this
den
for
several
years
but
i
believe
that
there
is
no
record
that
more
than
three
of
the
regicides
escaped
to
this
country
and
their
wanderings
are
otherwise
accounted
for
there
is
a
firm
belief
that
one
of
them
came
to
york
and
was
the
ancestor
of
many
persons
now
living
there
but
i
do
not
know
whether
he
can
have
been
the
hero
of
the
baker
spring
hermitage
beside
we
stopped
to
drink
some
of
the
delicious
water
which
never
fails
to
flow
cold
and
clear
under
the
shade
of
a
great
oak
and
were
amused
with
the
sight
of
a
flock
of
gay
little
country
children
who
passed
by
in
deep
conversation
what
could
such
atoms
of
humanity
be
talking
about
old
times
said
john
the
master
of
horse
with
instant
decision
we
met
now
and
then
a
man
or
woman
who
stopped
to
give
us
hospitable
greeting
but
there
was
no
staying
for
visits
lest
the
daylight
might
fail
us
it
was
delightful
to
find
this
neighborhood
so
thriving
and
populous
for
a
few
days
before
i
had
driven
over
three
miles
of
road
and
passed
only
one
house
that
was
tenanted
and
six
cellars
or
crumbling
chimneys
where
good
farmhouses
had
been
the
lilacs
blooming
in
solitude
and
the
fields
cleared
with
so
much
difficulty
a
century
or
two
ago
all
going
back
to
the
original
woodland
from
which
they
were
won
what
would
the
old
farmers
say
to
see
the
fate
of
their
worthy
bequest
to
the
younger
generation
they
would
wag
their
heads
sorrowfully
with
sad
foreboding
after
we
had
passed
more
woodland
and
a
quarry
where
for
a
wonder
the
derrick
was
not
creaking
and
not
a
single
hammer
was
clinking
at
the
stone
wedges
we
did
not
see
any
one
hoeing
in
the
fields
as
we
had
seen
so
many
on
the
white
rose
road
the
other
side
of
the
hills
presently
we
met
two
or
three
people
walking
sedately
clad
in
their
best
clothes
there
was
a
subdued
air
of
public
excitement
and
concern
and
one
of
us
remembered
that
there
had
been
a
death
in
the
neighborhood
this
was
the
day
of
the
funeral
the
man
had
been
known
to
us
in
former
years
we
had
an
instinct
to
hide
our
unsympathetic
pleasuring
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
except
to
follow
our
homeward
road
straight
by
the
house
the
occasion
was
nearly
ended
by
this
time
the
borrowed
chairs
were
being
set
out
in
the
yard
in
little
groups
even
the
funeral
supper
had
been
eaten
and
the
brothers
and
sisters
and
near
relatives
of
the
departed
man
were
just
going
home
the
new
grave
showed
plainly
out
in
the
green
field
near
by
he
had
belonged
to
one
of
the
ancient
families
of
the
region
long
settled
on
this
old
farm
by
the
narrow
river
they
had
given
their
name
to
a
bridge
and
the
bridge
had
christened
the
which
stood
close
by
we
were
much
struck
by
the
solemn
figure
of
the
mother
a
very
old
woman
as
she
walked
toward
her
old
home
with
some
of
her
remaining
children
i
had
not
thought
to
see
her
again
knowing
her
great
age
and
infirmity
she
was
like
a
presence
out
of
the
last
century
tall
and
still
erect
and
of
striking
features
and
a
firm
look
not
modern
but
as
if
her
mind
were
still
set
upon
an
earlier
and
simpler
scheme
of
life
an
air
of
dominion
cloaked
her
finely
she
had
long
been
queen
of
her
surroundings
and
to
her
great
family
royalty
is
a
quality
one
of
nature
gifts
and
there
one
might
behold
it
as
truly
as
if
victoria
regina
imperatrix
had
passed
by
the
natural
instincts
common
to
humanity
were
there
undisguised
unconcealed
simply
accepted
we
had
seen
a
royal
progress
she
was
the
central
figure
of
that
rural
society
as
you
looked
at
the
little
group
you
could
see
her
only
now
that
she
came
abroad
so
rarely
her
presence
was
not
without
deep
significance
and
so
she
took
her
homeward
way
with
a
primitive
kind
of
majesty
it
was
evident
that
the
neighborhood
was
in
great
excitement
and
quite
thrown
out
of
its
usual
placidity
an
acquaintance
came
from
a
small
house
farther
down
the
road
and
we
stopped
for
a
word
with
him
we
spoke
of
the
funeral
and
were
told
something
of
the
man
who
had
died
yes
and
there
a
man
layin
very
sick
here
said
our
friend
in
an
excited
whisper
wo
last
but
a
day
or
two
there
another
man
buried
yesterday
that
was
struck
by
lightnin
comin
acrost
a
field
when
that
great
shower
begun
the
lightnin
stove
through
his
hat
and
run
down
all
over
him
and
ploughed
a
spot
in
the
ground
there
was
a
knot
of
people
about
the
door
the
minister
of
that
scattered
parish
stood
among
them
and
they
all
looked
at
us
eagerly
as
if
we
too
might
be
carrying
news
of
a
fresh
disaster
through
the
countryside
somehow
the
melancholy
tales
did
not
touch
our
sympathies
as
they
ought
and
we
could
not
see
the
pathetic
side
of
them
as
at
another
time
the
day
was
so
full
of
cheer
and
the
sky
and
earth
so
glorious
the
very
fields
looked
busy
with
their
early
summer
growth
the
horses
began
to
think
of
the
clack
of
the
cover
and
we
were
hurried
along
between
the
silvery
willows
and
the
rustling
alders
taking
time
to
gather
a
handful
of
conserve
roses
by
the
roadside
and
where
the
highway
made
a
long
bend
eastward
among
the
farms
two
of
us
left
the
carriage
and
followed
a
footpath
along
the
green
river
bank
and
through
the
pastures
coming
out
to
the
road
again
only
a
minute
later
than
the
horses
i
believe
that
it
is
an
old
indian
trail
followed
from
the
salmon
falls
farther
down
the
river
where
the
indians
came
to
dry
the
plentiful
fish
for
their
winter
supplies
i
have
traced
the
greater
part
of
this
footpath
which
goes
straight
as
an
arrow
across
the
country
the
first
trail
being
from
the
falls
where
mason
settlers
came
in
and
built
their
great
works
of
a
with
a
gang
of
saws
and
presently
a
grist
mill
beside
to
emery
bridge
i
should
like
to
follow
the
old
footpath
still
farther
i
found
part
of
it
by
accident
a
long
time
ago
once
as
you
came
close
to
the
river
you
were
sure
to
find
fishermen
scattered
along
sometimes
i
myself
have
been
discovered
but
it
is
not
much
use
to
go
fishing
any
more
if
some
person
would
kindly
be
the
frank
buckland
of
new
england
and
try
to
have
the
laws
enforced
that
protect
the
inland
fisheries
he
would
do
his
country
great
service
years
ago
there
were
so
many
salmon
that
as
an
enthusiastic
old
friend
once
assured
me
you
could
walk
across
on
them
below
the
falls
but
now
they
are
unknown
simply
because
certain
substances
which
would
enrich
the
farms
are
thrown
from
factories
and
tanneries
into
our
clear
new
england
streams
good
river
fish
are
growing
very
scarce
the
smelts
and
bass
and
shad
have
all
left
this
upper
branch
of
the
piscataqua
as
the
salmon
left
it
long
ago
and
the
supply
of
one
necessary
sort
of
good
cheap
food
is
lost
to
a
growing
community
for
the
lack
of
a
little
thought
and
care
in
the
factory
companies
and
and
the
building
in
some
cases
of
over
the
dams
i
think
that
the
need
of
preaching
against
this
bad
economy
is
very
great
the
sight
of
a
proud
lad
with
a
string
of
undersized
trout
will
scatter
half
the
idlers
in
town
into
the
pastures
next
day
but
everybody
patiently
accepts
the
depopulation
of
a
fine
clear
river
where
the
tide
comes
fresh
from
the
sea
to
be
tainted
by
the
spoiled
stream
which
started
from
its
mountain
sources
as
pure
as
heart
could
wish
man
has
done
his
best
to
ruin
the
world
he
lives
in
one
is
tempted
to
say
at
impulsive
first
thought
but
after
all
as
i
mounted
the
last
hill
before
reaching
the
village
the
houses
took
on
a
new
look
of
comfort
and
pleasantness
the
fields
that
i
knew
so
well
were
a
fresher
green
than
before
the
sun
was
down
and
the
provocations
of
the
day
seemed
very
slight
compared
to
the
satisfaction
i
believed
that
with
a
little
more
time
we
should
grow
wiser
about
our
fish
and
other
things
beside
it
will
be
good
to
remember
the
white
rose
road
and
its
quietness
in
many
a
busy
town
day
to
come
as
i
think
of
these
slight
sketches
i
wonder
if
they
will
have
to
others
a
tinge
of
sadness
but
i
have
seldom
spent
an
afternoon
so
full
of
pleasure
and
fresh
and
delighted
consciousness
of
the
possibilities
of
rural
life
town
william
trimble
and
miss
rebecca
wright
were
driving
along
hampden
east
road
one
afternoon
in
early
spring
their
progress
was
slow
trimble
sorrel
horse
was
old
and
stiff
and
the
wheels
were
clogged
by
clay
mud
the
frost
was
not
yet
out
of
the
ground
although
the
snow
was
nearly
gone
except
in
a
few
places
on
the
north
side
of
the
woods
or
where
it
had
drifted
all
winter
against
a
length
of
fence
there
must
be
a
good
deal
o
snow
to
the
of
us
yet
said
trimble
i
feel
it
in
the
air
is
more
than
the
we
ai
goin
to
have
real
nice
weather
till
the
snow
all
gone
i
heard
say
yesterday
that
there
was
good
sleddin
yet
all
up
through
parsley
responded
miss
wright
i
should
like
to
live
in
them
northern
places
my
cousin
ellen
husband
was
a
parsley
man
he
was
obliged
as
you
may
have
heard
to
go
up
north
to
his
second
wife
funeral
got
back
day
before
yesterday
was
about
miles
an
they
started
on
wheels
but
when
they
gone
nine
or
ten
miles
they
found
was
no
sort
o
use
an
left
their
wagon
an
took
a
sleigh
the
man
that
owned
it
charged
four
six
too
i
should
have
thought
he
would
they
told
him
they
was
goin
to
a
funeral
an
they
had
their
own
buffaloes
an
everything
well
i
expect
it
a
good
deal
harder
scratchin
up
that
way
they
have
to
git
money
where
they
can
the
farms
is
very
poor
as
you
go
north
suggested
trimble
kindly
ai
none
too
rich
a
country
where
we
be
but
i
always
been
grateful
i
born
up
to
parsley
the
old
horse
plodded
along
and
the
sun
coming
out
from
the
heavy
spring
clouds
sent
a
sudden
shine
of
light
along
the
muddy
road
sister
wright
drew
her
large
veil
forward
over
the
high
brim
of
her
bonnet
she
was
not
used
to
driving
or
to
being
much
in
the
open
air
but
trimble
was
an
active
business
woman
and
looked
after
her
own
affairs
herself
in
all
weathers
the
late
trimble
had
left
her
a
good
farm
but
not
much
ready
money
and
it
was
often
said
that
she
was
better
off
in
the
end
than
if
he
had
lived
she
regretted
his
loss
deeply
however
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
speak
of
him
even
to
intimate
friends
without
emotion
and
nobody
had
ever
hinted
that
this
emotion
was
insincere
she
was
most
and
generous
and
in
her
limited
way
played
the
part
of
lady
bountiful
in
the
town
of
hampden
why
there
where
the
bray
girls
lives
ai
it
she
exclaimed
as
beyond
a
thicket
of
and
they
came
in
sight
of
a
solitary
farmhouse
the
barn
was
too
far
away
for
thrift
or
comfort
and
they
could
see
long
lines
of
light
between
the
shrunken
boards
as
they
came
nearer
the
fields
looked
both
stony
and
sodden
somehow
even
parsley
itself
could
be
hardly
more
forlorn
yes
said
miss
wright
that
where
they
live
now
poor
things
i
know
the
place
though
i
ai
been
up
here
for
years
you
suppose
mis
trimble
i
ai
seen
the
girls
out
to
meetin
all
winter
i
been
covetin
why
yes
rebecca
of
course
we
could
stop
answered
trimble
heartily
the
exercises
was
over
earlier
i
expected
an
goin
to
remain
over
night
long
o
me
you
know
there
wo
be
no
tea
till
we
git
there
so
we
ca
be
late
i
in
the
habit
o
sendin
a
basket
to
the
bray
girls
when
any
o
our
folks
is
comin
this
way
but
i
ai
been
to
see
since
they
moved
up
here
why
it
must
be
a
good
deal
over
a
year
ago
i
know
was
in
the
late
winter
they
had
to
make
the
move
was
cruel
hard
i
must
say
an
if
i
had
been
down
with
my
pleurisy
fever
i
have
stirred
round
an
done
about
it
there
was
a
good
deal
o
sickness
at
the
time
an
well
was
kind
o
rushed
through
breakin
of
up
an
lots
o
folks
blamed
the
but
when
was
done
was
done
an
nobody
took
holt
to
undo
it
ann
an
mandy
looked
same
ever
when
they
come
to
meetin
in
the
summer
kind
o
wishful
perhaps
always
sent
me
word
they
was
gittin
on
pretty
comfortable
that
would
be
their
way
said
rebecca
wright
they
never
was
any
hand
to
complain
though
mandy
less
cheerful
than
ann
if
mandy
been
spared
such
poor
eyesight
an
ann
had
got
her
lame
wrist
that
set
right
they
kep
off
the
town
fast
enough
they
both
shed
tears
when
they
talked
to
me
about
havin
to
break
up
when
i
went
to
see
before
i
went
over
to
brother
asa
you
see
we
was
brought
up
neighbors
an
we
went
to
school
together
the
brays
an
me
was
a
special
providence
brought
us
home
this
road
i
been
so
covetin
a
chance
to
git
to
see
my
lameness
hampers
me
i
glad
we
come
this
way
myself
said
trimble
i
like
to
see
just
how
they
fare
miss
rebecca
wright
continued
they
give
their
consent
to
goin
on
the
town
because
they
knew
got
to
be
dependent
an
so
they
felt
would
come
easier
for
all
than
for
a
few
to
help
they
acted
real
dignified
contrary
to
what
most
do
in
such
cases
but
they
was
dreadful
anxious
to
see
who
would
bid
off
day
they
did
so
hope
would
be
somebody
right
in
the
village
i
just
sat
down
an
cried
good
when
i
found
abel
janes
folks
had
got
hold
of
they
always
had
the
name
of
bein
slack
an
an
they
did
it
just
for
what
they
got
out
o
the
town
the
selectmen
this
last
year
ai
what
we
have
had
i
hope
they
been
considerate
about
the
bray
girls
i
should
have
more
considerate
about
fetchin
of
you
over
apologized
trimble
i
got
my
horse
an
you
too
far
for
you
to
come
but
time
does
slip
away
with
busy
folks
an
i
forgit
a
good
deal
i
ought
to
remember
there
nobody
more
considerate
than
you
be
protested
miss
rebecca
wright
trimble
made
no
answer
but
took
out
her
whip
and
gently
touched
the
sorrel
horse
who
walked
considerably
faster
but
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
trot
it
was
a
long
way
to
the
house
farther
down
the
road
and
up
a
lane
i
never
had
any
opinion
of
the
bray
girls
father
leavin
as
he
did
said
trimble
he
was
much
praised
in
his
time
though
there
was
always
some
said
his
early
life
had
been
up
to
the
mark
explained
her
companion
he
was
a
great
favorite
of
our
then
preacher
the
reverend
daniel
longbrother
they
did
a
good
deal
for
the
parish
but
they
did
it
their
own
way
deacon
bray
was
one
that
did
his
part
in
the
repairs
without
urging
you
know
was
in
his
time
the
first
repairs
was
made
when
they
got
out
the
old
an
them
handsome
square
pews
it
cost
an
awful
sight
o
money
too
they
had
done
payin
up
that
debt
when
they
set
to
alter
it
again
an
git
the
walls
frescoed
my
grandmother
was
one
that
always
spoke
her
mind
right
out
an
she
was
dreadful
opposed
to
breakin
up
the
square
pews
where
always
set
they
was
countin
up
what
would
cost
in
parish
meetin
an
she
riz
right
up
an
said
would
cost
nothin
to
let
stay
an
there
a
house
carpenter
left
in
the
parish
that
could
do
such
nice
work
an
time
would
come
when
the
would
give
their
to
have
the
old
look
just
as
it
did
then
but
haul
the
inside
to
pieces
they
would
and
did
there
come
to
be
a
real
fight
over
it
did
there
agreed
trimble
soothingly
well
good
taste
i
remember
the
old
house
well
i
come
here
as
a
child
to
visit
a
cousin
o
mother
trimble
folks
was
neighbors
an
we
was
drawed
to
each
other
then
young
we
was
trimble
spoke
of
it
many
the
time
that
first
time
he
ever
see
me
in
a
leghorn
hat
with
a
feather
was
one
that
mother
had
an
pressed
over
when
i
think
of
them
old
sermons
that
used
to
be
preached
in
that
old
of
all
i
glad
it
altered
over
so
not
to
remind
folks
said
miss
rebecca
wright
after
a
suitable
pause
them
old
brimstone
discourses
you
know
mis
trimble
preachers
is
far
more
reasonable
nowadays
why
i
set
an
thought
last
sabbath
as
i
listened
that
if
old
longbrother
an
deacon
bray
could
hear
the
difference
they
crack
the
ground
over
like
pole
beans
an
come
right
up
side
their
headstones
trimble
laughed
heartily
and
shook
the
reins
three
or
four
times
by
way
of
emphasis
there
no
gitting
round
you
she
said
much
pleased
i
should
think
deacon
bray
would
want
to
rise
any
way
if
was
so
he
could
an
knew
how
his
poor
girls
was
farin
a
man
ought
to
provide
for
his
folks
he
got
to
leave
behind
him
specially
if
they
women
to
be
sure
they
had
their
little
home
but
seen
how
with
all
their
industrious
ways
they
had
means
to
keep
it
i
he
thought
he
got
time
enough
to
lay
by
when
he
give
so
generous
in
collections
but
he
did
lay
by
an
there
they
be
he
might
have
took
lessons
from
the
squirrels
even
them
little
wild
creatur
makes
them
their
winter
hoards
an
ought
to
know
enough
if
squirrels
does
just
before
you
are
generous
what
was
always
set
for
the
b
in
the
when
i
was
to
school
and
it
often
runs
through
my
mind
for
man
his
days
are
as
grass
that
was
for
a
the
two
go
well
together
added
miss
rebecca
wright
soberly
my
good
gracious
this
a
place
it
makes
me
ache
to
think
them
nice
bray
girls
has
to
brook
it
here
the
sorrel
horse
though
somewhat
puzzled
by
an
unexpected
deviation
from
his
homeward
way
willingly
came
to
a
stand
by
the
gnawed
corner
of
the
fence
which
evidently
served
as
two
or
three
ragged
old
hens
were
picking
about
the
yard
and
at
last
a
face
appeared
at
the
kitchen
window
tied
up
in
a
handkerchief
as
if
it
were
a
case
of
toothache
by
the
time
our
friends
reached
the
side
door
next
this
window
janes
came
disconsolately
to
open
it
for
them
shutting
it
again
as
soon
as
possible
though
the
air
felt
more
chilly
inside
the
house
take
seats
said
janes
briefly
you
have
to
see
me
just
as
i
be
i
have
been
suffering
these
four
days
with
the
ague
and
everything

on
the
jury
was
inconvenient
to
spare
him
i
should
be
pleased
to
have
you
lay
off
your
things
comfortable
trimble
looked
about
the
cheerless
kitchen
and
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say
so
she
smiled
blandly
and
shook
her
head
in
answer
to
the
invitation
we
just
set
a
few
minutes
with
you
to
pass
the
time
o
day
an
then
we
must
go

miss
rebecca

an
undue

as

for
you
with
all
your
means
to
do
with
the
poor
woman
looked
pinched
and
miserable
herself
though
it
was
evident
that
she
had
no
gift
at
house
or
home
keeping
heart
was
wrung
with
pain
as
she
thought
of
the
unwelcome
inmates
of
such
a
place
but
she
held
her
peace
bravely
while
miss
rebecca
again
gave
some
brief
information
in
regard
to
the
installation
you
go
right
up
them
back
stairs
the

baskets
mis
trimble
an
i
relish

i
tell
you
i
shut
the
door
after

if
you

i
feel
every
draught
o
cold
air
i
always
heard
she
was
a
great
hand
to
make
a
poor
mouth
she
from
somewheres
up
parsley
way
whispered
miss
rebecca
as
they
stumbled
in
the
poor
meechin
body
wherever
she
come
from
replied
trimble
as
she
knocked
at
the
door
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
after
this
unusual
sound
then
one
of
the
bray
sisters
opened
the
door
the
eager
guests
stared
into
a
small
low
room
brown
with
age
and
gray
too
as
if
former
dust
and
cobwebs
could
not
be
made
wholly
to
disappear
the
two
elderly
women
who
stood
there
looked
like
captives
their
withered
faces
wore
a
look
of
apprehension
and
the
room
itself
was
more
bare
and
plain
than
was
fitting
to
their
evident
refinement
of
character
and
there
was
an
uncovered
small
table
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
with
some
crackers
on
a
plate
and
for
some
reason
or
other
this
added
a
great
deal
to
the
general
desolation
but
miss
ann
bray
the
elder
sister
who
carried
her
right
arm
in
a
sling
with
piteously
drooping
fingers
gazed
at
the
visitors
with
radiant
joy
she
had
not
seen
them
arrive
the
one
window
gave
only
the
view
at
the
back
of
the
house
across
the
fields
and
their
coming
was
indeed
a
surprise
the
next
minute
she
was
laughing
and
crying
together
oh
sister
she
said
if
here
ai
our
dear
mis
trimble
an
my
heart
o
goodness
is
wright
too
what
dear
good
creatur

felt
all
day
as
if
something

goin
to

just
sayin
to
myself
most
sundown
now
but
i
would
let
on
to
mandany
i
give
up
hope
quite
yet
you
see
the
scissors
stuck
in
the
floor
this
very
mornin
an
it
always
a
reliable
sign
there
i
got
to
kiss
ye
both
again
i
do
know
where
we
can
all
set
lamented
sister
mandana
there
ai
but
the
one
chair
an
the
bed
chair
too
rickety
we
been
promised
another
these
ten
days
but
first
they
forgot
it
an
next
mis
janes
ca
spare
it
one
excuse
an
another
i
am
goin
to
git
a
stump
o
wood
an
nail
a
board
on
to
it
when
i
can
git
outdoor
again
said
mandana
in
a
plaintive
voice
there
i
goin
to
complain
o
nothin
now
you
come
she
added
and
the
guests
sat
down
trimble
as
was
proper
in
the
one
chair
we
sat
on
the
bed
many
the
time
with
you
an
talked
over
our
girl
nonsense
ai
we
you
know
where
was
in
the
little
back
bedroom
we
had
when
we
was
girls
an
used
to
peek
out
at
our
beaux
through
the
strings
o
laughed
ann
bray
delightedly
her
thin
face
shining
more
and
more
with
joy
i
brought
some
o
them
seeds
along
when
we
come
away
we
raised
so
many
years
an
we
got
started
all
right
but
the
hens
found
out
i
declare
i
chased
them
poor
hens
foolish
as
was
but
the
i
counted
on
a
sight
to
remind
me
o
home
you
see
our
debts
was
so
large
after
my
long
sickness
an
all
that
we
did
feel
was
right
to
keep
back
anything
we
could
help
from
the
auction
it
was
impossible
for
any
one
to
speak
for
a
moment
or
two
the
sisters
felt
their
own
uprooted
condition
afresh
and
their
guests
for
the
first
time
really
comprehended
the
piteous
contrast
between
that
neat
little
village
house
which
now
seemed
a
palace
of
comfort
and
this
cold
unpainted
upper
room
in
the
remote
janes
farmhouse
it
was
an
unwelcome
thought
to
trimble
that
the
town
of
hampden
could
provide
no
better
for
its
poor
than
this
and
her
round
face
flushed
with
resentment
and
the
shame
of
personal
responsibility
the
girls
shall
be
well
settled
in
the
village
before
another
winter
if
i
pay
their
board
myself
she
made
an
inward
resolution
and
took
another
almost
tearful
look
at
the
broken
stove
the
miserable
bed
and
the
sisters
one
trunk
on
which
mandana
was
sitting
but
the
poor
place
was
filled
with
a
golden
spirit
of
hospitality
rebecca
was
again
discoursing
eloquently
of
the
installation
it
was
so
much
easier
to
speak
of
general
subjects
and
the
sisters
had
evidently
been
longing
to
hear
some
news
since
the
late
summer
they
had
not
been
to
church
and
presently
trimble
asked
the
reason
now
do
you
go
to
pouring
out
our
woes
mandy
begged
little
old
ann
looking
shy
and
almost
girlish
and
as
if
she
insisted
upon
playing
that
life
was
still
all
before
them
and
all
pleasure
you
go
to
spoilin
their
visit
with
our
complaints
they
know
we
do
that
changes
must
come
an
we
been
so
wonted
to
our
home
things
that
this
come
hard
at
first
but
then
they
felt
for
us
i
know
just
as
well
can
be
soon
be
summer
again
an
is
real
pleasant
right
out
in
the
fields
here
when
there
ai
too
hot
a
spell
i
got
to
know
a
sight
o
singin
birds
since
we
come
give
me
the
folks
i
always
known
sighed
the
younger
sister
who
looked
older
than
miss
ann
and
less
you
may
have
your
birds
if
you
want
i
do
long
to
go
to
meetin
an
see
folks
go
by
up
the
aisle
now
i
will
speak
of
it
ann
whatever
you
say
we
need
each
of
us
a
pair
o
good
stout
shoes
rubbers
ours
are
all
wore
out
an
we
asked
an
asked
an
they
never
think
to
bring
an
poor
old
mandana
on
the
trunk
covered
her
face
with
her
arms
and
sobbed
aloud
the
elder
sister
stood
over
her
and
patted
her
on
the
thin
shoulder
like
a
child
and
tried
to
comfort
her
it
crossed
trimble
mind
that
it
was
not
the
first
time
one
had
wept
and
the
other
had
comforted
the
sad
scene
must
have
been
repeated
many
times
in
that
long
drear
winter
she
would
see
them
forever
after
in
her
mind
as
fixed
as
a
picture
and
her
own
tears
fell
fast
you
did
see
mis
janes
cunning
little
boy
the
next
one
to
the
baby
did
you
asked
ann
bray
turning
round
quickly
at
last
and
going
cheerfully
on
with
the
conversation
now
hush
mandy
dear
they
think
you
childish
he
a
dear
friendly
little
creatur
an
likes
to
stay
with
us
a
good
deal
though
we
feel
if
it
was
too
cold
for
him
now
we
are
waitin
to
get
us
more
wood
when
i
think
of
the
acres
o
woodland
in
this
town
groaned
rebecca
wright
i
believe
i
goin
to
preach
next
sunday
o
the
minister
an
i
make
the
sparks
fly
i
always
heard
the
saying
everybody
business
is
nobody
business
an
i
come
to
believe
it
now
do
you
you
happened
on
a
kind
of
a
poor
time
with
us
but
we
got
more
belongings
than
you
see
here
an
a
good
large
cluset
where
we
can
store
those
things
there
ai
room
to
have
about
you
an
miss
trimble
have
happened
on
a
kind
of
poor
day
you
know
soon
i
git
me
some
stout
shoes
an
rubbers
as
mandy
says
i
can
fetch
home
plenty
o
little
dry
boughs
o
pine
you
remember
i
was
always
a
great
hand
to
roam
in
the
woods
if
we
could
only
have
a
front
room
so
we
could
look
out
on
the
road
an
see
passin
was
shod
for
meetin
i
don
know
we
should
complain
now
we
just
goin
to
give
you
what
we
got
an
make
out
with
a
good
welcome
we
make
more
tea
we
want
in
the
mornin
an
then
let
the
fire
go
down
since
has
been
so
mild
we
got
a
cluset
disappearing
as
she
spoke
an
i
know
this
to
be
good
tea
it
some
o
yourn
mis
trimble
an
here
our
sprigged
chiny
cups
that
knows
by
sight
if
mis
trimble
do
we
kep
out
four
of
an
put
the
even
half
dozen
with
the
rest
of
the
auction
stuff
i
often
wondered
who
got
but
i
never
asked
for
fear
would
be
somebody
that
would
distress
us
they
was
mother
you
know
the
four
cups
were
poured
and
the
little
table
pushed
to
the
bed
where
rebecca
wright
still
sat
and
mandana
wiping
her
eyes
came
and
joined
her
trimble
sat
in
her
chair
at
the
end
and
ann
trotted
about
the
room
in
pleased
content
for
a
while
and
in
and
out
of
the
closet
as
if
she
still
had
much
to
do
then
she
came
and
stood
opposite
trimble
she
was
very
short
and
small
and
there
was
no
painful
sense
of
her
being
obliged
to
stand
the
four
cups
were
not
quite
full
of
cold
tea
but
there
was
a
clean
old
tablecloth
folded
double
and
a
plate
with
three
pairs
of
crackers
neatly
piled
and
a
small
it
must
be
owned
a
very
small
piece
of
hard
white
cheese
then
for
a
treat
in
a
glass
dish
there
was
a
little
preserved
peach
the
last
miss
rebecca
knew
it
instinctively
of
the
household
stores
brought
from
their
old
home
it
was
very
sugary
this
bit
of
peach
and
as
she
helped
her
guests
and
sister
mandy
miss
ann
bray
said
half
unconsciously
as
she
often
had
said
with
less
reason
in
the
old
days
our
preserves
ai
so
good
as
usual
this
year
this
is
beginning
to
candy
both
the
guests
protested
while
rebecca
added
that
the
taste
of
it
carried
her
back
and
made
her
feel
young
again
the
brays
had
always
managed
to
keep
one
or
two
alive
in
their
corner
of
a
garden
i
been
keeping
this
preserve
for
a
treat
said
her
friend
i
glad
to
have
you
eat
some
last
summer
i
often
wished
you
was
home
an
could
come
an
see
us
o
being
away
off
to
plainfields
the
crackers
did
not
taste
too
dry
miss
ann
took
the
last
of
the
peach
on
her
own
cracker
there
could
not
have
been
quite
a
small
spoonful
after
the
others
were
helped
but
she
asked
them
first
if
they
would
not
have
some
more
then
there
was
a
silence
and
in
the
silence
a
wave
of
tender
feeling
rose
high
in
the
hearts
of
the
four
elderly
women
at
this
moment
the
setting
sun
flooded
the
poor
plain
room
with
light
the
unpainted
wood
was
all
of
a
and
ann
bray
with
her
gray
hair
and
aged
face
stood
at
the
head
of
the
table
in
a
kind
of
aureole
trimble
face
was
all
aquiver
as
she
looked
at
her
she
thought
of
the
text
about
two
or
three
being
gathered
together
and
was
half
afraid
i
believe
we
ought
to
asked
mis
janes
if
she
would
come
up
said
ann
she
real
good
feelin
but
she
had
it
very
hard
gits
discouraged
i
ca
find
that
she
ever
had
anything
real
pleasant
to
look
back
to
as
we
have
there
next
time
we
make
a
good
heartenin
time
for
her
too
the
sorrel
horse
had
taken
a
long
nap
by
the
gnawed
and
the
cool
air
after
sundown
made
him
impatient
to
be
gone
the
two
friends
jolted
homeward
in
the
gathering
darkness
through
the
stiffening
mud
and
neither
trimble
nor
rebecca
wright
said
a
word
until
they
were
out
of
sight
as
well
as
out
of
sound
of
the
janes
house
time
must
elapse
before
they
could
reach
a
more
familiar
part
of
the
road
and
resume
conversation
on
its
natural
level
i
consider
myself
to
blame
insisted
trimble
at
last
i
have
no
words
of
accusation
for
nobody
else
an
i
ai
one
to
take
comfort
in
calling
names
to
the
board
o
i
make

she
says
dear
creatur
exclaimed
trimble
i
full
o
regrets
i
took
time
for
that
installation
an
set
there
seepin
in
a
lot
o
talk
this
whole
day
long
except
for
its
kind
of
bringin
us
to
the
bray
girls
i
wish
to
my
heart
was
mornin
an
i
for
the
a
native
of
winby
i
on
the
teacher
desk
in
the
little
roadside
there
was
a
bunch
of
mayflowers
beside
a
dented
and
bent
brass
bell
a
small
worcester
dictionary
without
any
cover
and
a
worn
bible
these
were
placed
in
an
orderly
row
and
behind
them
was
a
small
wooden
box
which
held
some
broken
pieces
of
blackboard
crayon
the
teacher
whom
no
timid
new
scholar
could
look
at
boldly
wore
her
accustomed
air
of
authority
and
importance
she
might
have
been
nineteen
years
old
not
more
but
for
the
time
being
she
scorned
the
frivolities
of
youth
the
hot
may
sun
was
shining
in
at
the
smoky
windows
sometimes
an
outside
shutter
swung
to
with
a
creak
and
eclipsed
the
glare
the
narrow
door
stood
wide
open
to
the
left
as
you
faced
the
desk
and
an
old
spotted
dog
lay
asleep
on
the
step
and
looked
wise
and
old
enough
to
have
gone
to
school
with
several
generations
of
children
it
was
half
past
three
in
the
afternoon
and
the
primer
class
settled
into
the
apathy
of
fatigue
presented
a
straggling
front
as
they
stood
listlessly
on
the
floor
as
for
the
big
boys
and
girls
they
also
were
longing
to
be
at
liberty
but
the
pretty
teacher
miss
marilla
hender
seemed
quite
as
energetic
as
when
school
was
begun
in
the
morning
the
spring
breeze
blew
in
at
the
open
door
and
even
fluttered
the
primer
leaves
but
the
back
of
the
room
felt
hot
and
close
as
if
it
were
midsummer
the
children
in
the
class
read
their
lessons
in
those
droning
voices
which
older
teachers
learn
to
associate
with
faint
powers
of
perception
only
one
or
two
of
them
had
an
awakened
human
look
in
their
eyes
such
as
matthew
arnold
delighted
himself
in
finding
so
often
in
the
of
france
most
of
these
poor
little
students
were
as
inadequate
at
that
weary
moment
to
the
pursuit
of
letters
as
if
they
had
been
woolly
spring
lambs
on
a
sunny
hillside
the
teacher
corrected
and
admonished
with
great
patience
glancing
now
and
then
toward
points
of
danger
and
insurrection
whence
came
a
suspicious
buzz
of
whispering
from
behind
a
or
a
pair
of
widespread
large
geographies
now
and
then
a
toiling
child
would
rise
and
come
down
the
aisle
with
his
forefinger
firm
upon
a
puzzling
word
as
if
it
were
an
unclassified
insect
it
was
a
lovely
beckoning
day
the
children
felt
like
captives
there
was
something
that
provoked
rebellion
in
the
droning
voices
the
buzzing
of
an
early
wild
bee
against
the
sunlit
pane
and
even
in
the
stuffy
familiar
odor
of
the
place
the
odor
of
apples
and
crumbs
of
doughnuts
and
gingerbread
in
the
dinner
pails
on
the
high
entry
nails
and
of
all
the
little
gowns
and
trousers
that
had
brushed
through
junipers
and
young
pines
on
their
way
to
school
the
bee
left
his
prisoning
pane
at
last
and
came
over
to
the
mayflowers
which
were
in
full
bloom
although
the
season
was
very
late
and
deep
in
the
woods
there
were
still
some
graybacked
snowdrifts
speckled
with
bits
of
bark
and
moss
from
the
trees
above
come
come
ezra
urged
the
young
teacher
rapping
her
desk
sharply
stop
watchin
that
common
bee
you
know
well
enough
what
those
letters
spell
you
wo
learn
to
read
at
this
rate
until
you
are
a
grown
man
mind
your
book
now
you
ought
to
remember
who
went
to
this
school
when
he
was
a
little
boy
you
heard
folks
tell
about
the
honorable
joseph
laneway
he
used
to
be
in
primer
just
as
you
are
now
and
was
long
before
he
was
out
of
it
either
and
was
called
the
smartest
boy
in
school
he
got
to
be
a
general
and
a
senator
and
one
of
the
richest
men
out
west
you
do
seem
to
have
the
least
mite
of
ambition
any
of
you
the
exhortation
entirely
personal
in
the
beginning
had
swiftly
passed
to
a
general
rebuke
ezra
looked
relieved
and
the
other
children
brightened
up
as
they
recognized
a
tale
familiar
to
their
ears
anything
was
better
than
trying
to
study
in
that
dull
last
hour
of
afternoon
school
yes
continued
miss
hender
pleased
that
she
had
at
last
roused
something
like
proper
attention
you
all
ought
to
be
proud
that
you
are
schoolmates
of
district
number
four
and
can
remember
that
the
celebrated
general
laneway
had
the
same
early
advantages
as
you
and
think
what
he
has
made
of
himself
by
perseverance
and
ambition
the
pupils
were
familiar
enough
with
the
illustrious
history
of
their
noble
predecessor
they
were
sure
to
be
told
in
lawless
moments
that
if
laneway
were
to
come
in
and
see
them
he
would
be
mortified
to
death
and
the
members
of
the
school
committee
always
referred
to
him
and
said
that
he
had
been
a
poor
boy
and
was
now
a
man
as
if
every
man
were
not
as
to
his
character
and
reputation
at
this
point
young
johnny
spencer
showed
his
next
neighbor
in
the
back
of
his
colburn
arithmetic
an
imaginary
portrait
of
their
district
hero
which
caused
them
both
to
chuckle
derisively
the
honorable
laneway
figured
on
the
flyleaf
as
an
extremely
person
with
strangely
crooked
legs
and
arms
and
a
terrific
expression
he
was
outlined
with
red
and
blue
pencils
as
to
coat
and
trousers
and
held
a
reddened
scalp
in
one
hand
and
a
blue
tomahawk
in
the
other
being
closely
associated
in
the
artist
mind
with
the
early
settlements
of
the
far
west
there
was
a
noise
of
wheels
in
the
road
near
by
and
though
miss
hender
had
much
more
to
say
everybody
ceased
to
listen
to
her
and
turned
toward
the
windows
leaning
far
forward
over
their
desks
to
see
who
might
be
passing
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
shiny
carriage
the
old
dog
bounded
out
barking
but
nothing
passed
the
open
door
the
carriage
had
stopped
some
one
was
coming
to
the
school
somebody
was
going
to
be
called
out
it
could
not
be
the
committee
whose
pompous
and
uninspiring
spring
visit
had
taken
place
only
the
week
before
presently
a
elderly
man
with
an
expectant
masterful
look
stood
on
the
doorstep
glanced
in
with
a
smile
and
knocked
miss
marilla
hender
blushed
smoothed
her
pretty
hair
anxiously
with
both
hands
and
stepped
down
from
her
little
platform
to
answer
the
summons
there
was
hardly
a
shut
mouth
in
the
primer
class
would
it
be
convenient
for
you
to
receive
a
visitor
to
the
school
the
stranger
asked
politely
with
a
fine
bow
of
deference
to
miss
hender
he
looked
much
pleased
and
a
little
excited
and
the
teacher
said
certainly
step
right
in
wo
you
sir
in
quite
another
tone
from
that
in
which
she
had
just
addressed
the
school
the
boys
and
girls
were
sitting
straight
and
silent
in
their
places
in
something
like
a
fit
of
apprehension
and
unpreparedness
at
such
a
great
emergency
the
guest
represented
a
type
of
person
previously
unknown
in
district
number
four
everything
about
him
spoke
of
wealth
and
authority
the
old
dog
returned
to
the
doorstep
and
after
a
careful
look
at
the
invader
approached
him
with
a
funny
doggish
grin
and
a
desperate
wag
of
the
tail
to
beg
for
recognition
the
teacher
gave
her
chair
on
the
platform
to
the
guest
and
stood
beside
him
with
very
red
cheeks
smoothing
her
hair
again
once
or
twice
and
keeping
the
ruler
fast
in
hand
like
a
badge
of
office
primer
class
may
now
retire
she
said
firmly
although
the
lesson
was
not
more
than
half
through
and
the
class
promptly
escaped
to
their
seats
waddling
and
stumbling
until
they
all
came
up
behind
their
desks
face
foremost
and
added
themselves
to
the
number
of
staring
young
countenances
after
this
there
was
a
silence
which
grew
more
and
more
embarrassing
perhaps
you
would
be
pleased
to
hear
our
first
class
in
geography
sir
asked
the
fair
marilla
recovering
her
presence
of
mind
and
the
guest
kindly
assented
the
young
teacher
was
by
no
means
willing
to
give
up
a
certainty
for
an
uncertainty
yesterday
lesson
had
been
well
learned
she
turned
back
to
the
questions
about
the
state
of
kansota
and
at
the
first
sentence
the
mysterious
visitor
dignity
melted
into
an
unconscious
smile
he
listened
intently
for
a
minute
and
then
seemed
to
reoccupy
himself
with
his
own
thoughts
and
purposes
looking
eagerly
about
the
old
and
sometimes
gazing
steadily
at
the
children
the
lesson
went
on
finely
and
when
it
was
finished
miss
hender
asked
the
girl
at
the
head
of
the
class
to
name
the
states
and
territories
which
she
instantly
did
mispronouncing
nearly
all
the
names
of
the
latter
then
others
stated
boundaries
and
capitals
and
the
resources
of
the
new
england
states
passing
on
finally
to
the
names
of
the
presidents
miss
hender
glowed
with
pride
she
had
worked
hard
over
the
geography
class
in
the
winter
term
and
it
did
not
fail
her
on
this
great
occasion
when
she
turned
bravely
to
see
if
the
gentleman
would
like
to
ask
any
questions
she
found
that
he
was
apparently
lost
in
a
deep
reverie
so
she
repeated
her
own
question
more
distinctly
they
have
done
very
well
very
well
indeed
he
answered
kindly
and
then
to
every
one
surprise
he
rose
went
up
the
aisle
pushed
johnny
spencer
gently
along
his
bench
and
sat
down
beside
him
the
space
was
cramped
and
the
stranger
looked
huge
and
uncomfortable
so
that
everybody
laughed
except
one
of
the
big
girls
who
turned
pale
with
fright
and
thought
he
must
be
crazy
when
this
girl
gave
a
faint
squeak
miss
hender
recovered
herself
and
rapped
twice
with
the
ruler
to
restore
order
then
became
entirely
tranquil
there
had
been
talk
of
replacing
the
hacked
and
worn
old
with
patent
desks
and
chairs
this
was
probably
an
agent
connected
with
that
business
at
once
she
was
resolute
and
and
said
no
whispering
in
a
firm
tone
that
showed
she
did
not
mean
to
be
trifled
with
the
geography
class
was
dismissed
but
the
elderly
gentleman
in
his
handsome
overcoat
still
sat
there
wedged
in
at
johnny
spencer
side
i
presume
sir
that
you
are
canvassing
for
new
desks
said
miss
hender
with
dignity
you
will
have
to
see
the
supervisor
and
the
selectmen
there
did
not
seem
to
be
any
need
of
his
lingering
but
she
had
an
ardent
desire
to
be
pleasing
to
a
person
of
such
evident
distinction
we
always
tell
strangers
i
thought
sir
you
might
be
gratified
to
know
that
this
is
the
where
the
honorable
joseph
laneway
first
attended
school
all
do
not
know
that
he
was
born
in
this
town
and
went
west
very
young
it
is
only
about
a
mile
from
here
where
his
folks
used
to
live
at
this
moment
the
visitor
eyes
fell
he
did
not
look
at
pretty
marilla
any
more
but
opened
johnny
spencer
arithmetic
and
seeing
the
imaginary
portrait
of
the
great
general
laneway
laughed
a
little
a
very
comfortable
laugh
it
was
while
johnny
himself
turned
cold
with
alarm
he
could
not
have
told
why
it
was
very
still
in
the
the
bee
was
buzzing
and
bumping
at
the
pane
again
the
moment
was
one
of
intense
expectation
the
stranger
looked
at
the
children
right
and
left
the
fact
is
this
young
people
said
he
in
a
tone
that
was
half
pride
and
half
apology
i
am
joseph
laneway
myself
he
tried
to
extricate
himself
from
the
narrow
quarters
of
the
desk
but
for
an
embarrassing
moment
found
that
he
was
stuck
fast
johnny
spencer
instinctively
gave
him
an
assisting
push
and
once
free
the
great
soldier
statesman
and
millionaire
took
a
few
steps
forward
to
the
open
floor
then
after
hesitating
a
moment
he
mounted
the
little
platform
and
stood
in
the
teacher
place
marilla
hender
was
as
pale
as
ashes
i
have
thought
many
times
the
great
guest
began
that
some
day
i
should
come
back
to
visit
this
place
which
is
so
closely
interwoven
with
the
memories
of
my
childhood
in
my
on
the
fields
of
war
in
the
halls
of
congress
and
most
of
all
in
my
western
home
my
thoughts
have
flown
back
to
the
hills
and
brooks
of
winby
and
to
this
little
old
i
could
shut
my
eyes
and
call
back
the
buzz
of
voices
and
fear
my
teacher
frown
and
feel
my
boyish
ambitions
waking
and
stirring
in
my
breast
on
that
bench
where
i
just
sat
i
saw
some
notches
that
i
cut
with
my
first
jackknife
years
ago
this
very
spring
i
remember
the
faces
of
the
boys
and
girls
who
went
to
school
with
me
and
i
see
their
grandchildren
before
me
i
know
that
one
is
a
goodsoe
and
another
a
winn
by
the
old
family
look
one
generation
goes
and
another
comes
there
are
many
things
that
i
might
say
to
you
i
meant
even
in
those
early
restricted
days
to
make
my
name
known
and
i
dare
say
that
you
too
have
ambition
be
careful
what
you
wish
for
in
this
world
for
if
you
wish
hard
enough
you
are
sure
to
get
it
i
once
heard
a
very
wise
man
say
this
and
the
longer
i
live
the
more
firmly
i
believe
it
to
be
true
but
wishing
hard
means
working
hard
for
what
you
want
and
the
world
prizes
wait
for
the
men
and
women
who
are
ready
to
take
pains
to
win
them
be
careful
and
set
your
minds
on
the
best
things
i
meant
to
be
a
rich
man
when
i
was
a
boy
here
and
i
stand
before
you
a
rich
man
knowing
the
care
and
anxiety
and
responsibility
of
wealth
i
meant
to
go
to
congress
and
i
am
one
of
the
senators
from
kansota
i
say
this
as
humbly
as
i
say
it
proudly
i
used
to
read
of
the
valor
and
patriotism
of
the
old
greeks
and
romans
with
my
youthful
blood
leaping
along
my
veins
and
it
came
to
pass
that
my
own
country
was
in
danger
and
that
i
could
help
to
fight
her
battles
perhaps
some
one
of
these
little
lads
has
before
him
a
more
eventful
life
than
i
have
lived
and
is
looking
forward
to
activity
and
honor
and
the
pride
of
fame
i
wish
him
all
the
joy
that
i
have
had
all
the
toil
that
i
have
had
and
all
the
bitter
disappointments
even
for
adversity
leads
a
man
to
depend
upon
that
which
is
above
him
and
the
path
of
glory
is
a
lonely
path
beset
by
temptations
and
a
bitter
sense
of
the
weakness
and
imperfection
of
man
i
see
my
life
spread
out
like
a
great
picture
as
i
stand
here
in
my
boyhood
place
i
regret
my
failures
i
thank
god
for
what
in
his
kind
providence
has
been
honest
and
right
i
am
glad
to
come
back
but
i
feel
as
i
look
in
your
young
faces
that
i
am
an
old
man
while
your
lives
are
just
beginning
when
you
remember
in
years
to
come
that
i
came
here
to
see
the
old
remember
that
i
said
wish
for
the
best
things
and
work
hard
to
win
them
try
to
be
good
men
and
women
for
the
honor
of
the
school
and
the
town
and
the
noble
young
country
that
gave
you
birth
be
kind
at
home
and
generous
abroad
remember
that
i
an
old
man
who
had
seen
much
of
life
begged
you
to
be
brave
and
good
the
honorable
laneway
had
rarely
felt
himself
so
moved
in
any
of
his
public
speeches
but
he
was
obliged
to
notice
that
for
once
he
could
not
hold
his
audience
the
primer
class
especially
had
begun
to
flag
in
attention
but
one
or
two
faces
among
the
elder
scholars
fairly
shone
with
vital
sympathy
and
a
lovely
prescience
of
their
future
their
eyes
met
his
as
if
they
struck
a
flash
of
light
there
was
a
sturdy
boy
who
half
rose
in
his
place
unconsciously
the
color
coming
and
going
in
his
cheeks
something
in
laneway
words
lit
the
altar
flame
in
his
reverent
heart
marilla
hender
was
pleased
and
a
little
dazed
she
could
not
have
repeated
what
her
illustrious
visitor
had
said
but
she
longed
to
tell
everybody
the
news
that
he
was
in
town
and
had
come
to
school
to
make
an
address
she
had
never
seen
a
great
man
before
and
really
needed
time
to
reflect
upon
him
and
to
consider
what
she
ought
to
say
she
was
just
quivering
with
the
attempt
to
make
a
proper
reply
and
thank
laneway
for
the
honor
of
his
visit
to
the
school
when
he
asked
her
which
of
the
boys
could
be
trusted
to
drive
back
his
hired
horse
to
the
four
corners
eight
boys
large
and
small
nearly
every
boy
in
the
school
rose
at
once
and
snapped
insistent
fingers
but
johnny
spencer
alone
was
desirous
not
to
attract
attention
to
himself
the
colburn
intellectual
arithmetic
with
the
portrait
had
been
well
secreted
between
his
tight
jacket
and
his
shirt
miss
hender
selected
a
trustworthy
freckled
person
in
long
trousers
who
was
half
way
to
the
door
in
an
instant
and
was
heard
almost
immediately
to
shout
loudly
at
the
quiet
horse
then
the
hero
of
district
number
four
made
his
acknowledgments
to
the
teacher
i
fear
that
i
have
interrupted
you
too
long
he
said
with
pleasing
deference
marilla
replied
that
it
was
of
no
consequence
she
hoped
he
would
call
again
she
may
have
spoken
primly
but
her
pretty
eyes
said
everything
that
her
lips
forgot
my
grandmother
will
want
to
see
you
sir
she
ventured
to
say
i
guess
you
will
remember
her
mis
hender
she
that
was
abby
harran
she
has
often
told
me
how
you
used
to
get
your
lessons
out
o
the
same
book
abby
harran
granddaughter
laneway
looked
at
her
again
with
fresh
interest
yes
i
wish
to
see
her
more
than
any
one
else
tell
her
that
i
am
coming
to
see
her
before
i
go
away
and
give
her
my
love
thank
you
my
dear
as
marilla
offered
his
missing
hat
boys
and
girls
he
stopped
and
looked
at
them
once
more
from
the
boys
entry
and
turned
again
to
look
back
from
the
very
doorstep
sir
piped
two
or
three
of
the
young
voices
but
most
of
the
children
only
stared
and
neither
spoke
nor
moved
we
will
omit
the
class
in
fourth
reader
this
afternoon
the
class
in
grammar
may
recite
said
miss
hender
in
her
most
contained
and
official
manner
the
grammar
class
sighed
like
a
single
pupil
and
obeyed
she
was
very
stern
with
the
grammar
class
but
every
one
in
school
had
an
inner
sense
that
it
was
a
great
day
in
the
history
of
district
number
four
ii
the
honorable
laneway
found
the
outdoor
air
very
fresh
and
sweet
after
the
closeness
of
the
it
had
just
that
same
odor
in
his
boyhood
and
as
he
escaped
he
had
a
delightful
sense
of
playing
truant
or
of
having
an
unexpected
holiday
it
was
easier
to
think
of
himself
as
a
boy
and
to
slip
back
into
boyish
thoughts
than
to
bear
the
familiar
burden
of
his
manhood
he
climbed
the
stone
wall
across
the
road
and
went
along
a
narrow
path
to
the
spring
that
bubbled
up
clear
and
cold
under
a
great
red
oak
how
many
times
he
had
longed
for
a
drink
of
that
water
and
now
here
it
was
and
the
thirst
of
that
warm
spring
day
was
hard
to
quench
again
and
again
he
stopped
to
fill
the
birchbark
dipper
which
the
had
made
just
as
his
own
comrades
made
theirs
years
before
the
was
dying
at
the
top
the
pine
woods
beyond
had
been
cut
and
had
grown
again
since
his
boyhood
and
looked
much
as
he
remembered
them
beyond
the
spring
and
away
from
the
woods
the
path
led
across
overgrown
pastures
to
another
road
perhaps
three
quarters
of
a
mile
away
and
near
this
road
was
the
small
farm
which
had
been
his
former
home
as
he
walked
slowly
along
he
was
met
again
and
again
by
some
reminder
of
his
youthful
days
he
had
always
liked
to
refer
to
his
early
life
in
new
england
in
his
political
addresses
and
had
spoken
more
than
once
of
going
to
find
the
cows
at
nightfall
in
the
autumn
evenings
and
being
glad
to
warm
his
bare
feet
in
the
places
where
the
sleepy
beasts
had
lain
before
he
followed
their
slow
steps
homeward
through
bush
and
brier
the
honorable
laneway
had
a
touch
of
true
sentiment
which
added
much
to
his
really
stirring
and
effective
campaign
speeches
he
had
often
been
called
the
king
of
the
platform
in
his
adopted
state
he
had
long
ago
grown
used
to
saying
go
to
one
man
and
come
to
another
like
the
ruler
of
old
but
all
his
natural
power
of
leadership
and
habit
of
authority
disappeared
at
once
as
he
trod
the
pasture
slopes
calling
back
the
remembrance
of
his
childhood
here
was
the
place
where
two
lads
older
than
himself
had
killed
a
terrible
woodchuck
at
bay
in
the
angle
of
a
great
rock
and
just
beyond
was
the
sunny
spot
where
he
had
picked
a
bunch
of
pink
and
white
anemones
under
a
prickly
barberry
thicket
to
give
to
abby
harran
in
morning
school
she
had
put
them
into
her
desk
and
let
them
wilt
there
but
she
was
pleased
when
she
took
them
abby
harran
the
little
teacher
grandmother
was
a
year
older
than
he
and
had
wakened
the
earliest
thought
of
love
in
his
youthful
breast
it
was
almost
time
to
catch
the
first
sight
of
his
birthplace
from
the
knoll
just
ahead
he
had
often
seen
the
light
of
his
mother
lamp
as
he
came
home
from
school
on
winter
afternoons
but
when
he
reached
the
knoll
the
old
house
was
gone
and
so
was
the
great
that
grew
beside
it
and
a
pang
of
disappointment
shot
through
this
devout
pilgrim
heart
he
never
had
doubted
that
the
old
farm
was
somebody
home
still
and
had
counted
upon
the
pleasure
of
spending
a
night
there
and
sleeping
again
in
that
room
under
the
roof
where
the
rain
sounded
loud
and
the
walnut
branches
brushed
to
and
fro
when
the
wind
blew
as
if
they
were
the
claws
of
tigers
he
hurried
across
the
fields
long
ago
turned
into
sheep
pastures
where
the
last
year
tall
grass
and
stood
gray
and
tracing
the
old
walls
and
fences
and
astonished
to
see
how
small
the
fields
had
been
the
prosperous
owner
of
western
farming
lands
could
not
help
remembering
those
widespread
luxuriant
acres
and
the
broad
outlooks
of
his
western
home
it
was
difficult
at
first
to
find
exactly
where
the
house
had
stood
even
the
foundations
had
disappeared
at
last
in
the
long
faded
grass
he
discovered
the
doorstep
and
near
by
was
a
little
mound
where
the
great
stump
had
been
the
cellar
was
a
mere
dent
in
the
sloping
ground
it
had
been
filled
in
by
the
growing
grass
and
slow
processes
of
summer
and
winter
weather
but
just
at
the
right
were
some
thorny
twigs
of
an
old
rosebush
a
sudden
brightening
of
memory
brought
to
mind
the
love
that
his
mother
dead
since
his
fifteenth
year
had
kept
for
this
sweetbrier
how
often
she
had
wished
that
she
had
brought
it
to
her
new
home
so
much
had
changed
in
the
world
so
many
had
gone
into
the
world
of
light
and
here
the
faithful
blooming
thing
was
yet
alive
there
was
one
slender
branch
where
green
buds
were
starting
and
getting
ready
to
flower
in
the
new
year
the
afternoon
wore
late
and
still
the
man
lingered
he
might
have
laughed
at
some
one
else
who
gave
himself
up
to
sad
thoughts
and
found
fault
with
himself
with
no
defendant
to
plead
his
cause
at
the
bar
of
conscience
it
was
an
altogether
lonely
hour
he
had
dreamed
all
his
life
in
a
sentimental
fashion
of
this
return
to
winby
it
had
always
appeared
to
be
a
grand
affair
but
so
far
he
was
himself
the
only
interested
spectator
at
his
poor
occasion
there
was
even
a
dismal
consciousness
that
he
had
been
undignified
perhaps
even
a
little
consequential
and
silly
in
the
old
the
picture
of
himself
on
the
in
johnny
spencer
arithmetic
was
the
only
tribute
that
this
day
had
held
but
he
laughed
aloud
delightedly
at
the
remembrance
and
really
liked
that
solemn
little
boy
who
sat
at
his
own
old
desk
there
was
another
older
lad
who
sat
at
the
back
of
the
room
who
reminded
laneway
of
himself
in
his
eager
youth
there
was
a
spark
of
light
in
that
fellow
eyes
once
or
twice
in
the
earlier
afternoon
as
he
drove
along
he
had
asked
people
in
the
road
if
there
were
a
laneway
family
in
that
neighborhood
but
everybody
had
said
no
in
indifferent
fashion
somehow
he
had
been
expecting
that
every
one
would
know
him
and
greet
him
and
give
him
credit
for
what
he
had
tried
to
do
but
old
winby
had
her
own
affairs
to
look
after
and
did
very
well
without
any
of
his
help
laneway
acknowledged
to
himself
at
this
point
that
he
was
weak
and
unmanly
there
must
be
some
old
friends
who
would
remember
him
and
give
him
as
hearty
a
welcome
as
the
greeting
he
had
brought
for
them
so
he
rose
and
went
his
way
westward
toward
the
sunset
the
air
was
growing
damp
and
cold
and
it
was
time
to
make
sure
of
shelter
this
was
hardly
like
the
visit
he
had
meant
to
pay
to
his
birthplace
he
wished
with
all
his
heart
that
he
had
never
come
back
but
he
walked
briskly
away
intent
upon
wider
thoughts
as
the
fresh
evening
breeze
quickened
his
steps
he
did
not
consider
where
he
was
going
but
was
for
a
time
the
busy
man
of
affairs
stimulated
by
the
unconscious
influence
of
his
surroundings
the
slender
gray
birches
and
pitch
pines
of
that
neglected
pasture
had
never
before
seen
a
hat
and
coat
exactly
in
the
fashion
they
may
have
been
abashed
by
the
presence
of
a
united
states
senator
and
western
millionaire
though
a
piece
of
new
england
ground
that
had
often
felt
the
tread
of
his
bare
feet
was
not
likely
to
quake
because
a
pair
of
smart
shoes
stepped
hastily
along
the
path
iii
there
was
an
imperative
knock
at
the
side
door
of
the
hender
farmhouse
just
after
dark
the
young
had
come
home
late
because
she
had
stopped
all
the
way
along
to
give
people
the
news
of
her
afternoon
experience
marilla
was
not
coy
and
speechless
any
longer
but
sat
by
the
kitchen
stove
telling
her
eager
grandmother
everything
she
could
remember
or
could
imagine
who
that
knocking
at
the
door
interrupted
hender
no
go
myself
i
nearest
the
man
outside
was
cold
and
he
was
not
used
to
spending
a
whole
day
unrecognized
and
after
being
first
amused
and
even
enjoying
a
sense
of
freedom
at
escaping
his
just
dues
of
consideration
and
respect
he
had
begun
to
feel
as
if
he
were
old
and
forgotten
and
was
hardly
sure
of
a
friend
in
the
world
old
hender
came
to
the
door
with
her
eyes
shining
with
delight
in
great
haste
to
dismiss
whoever
had
knocked
so
that
she
might
hear
the
rest
of
marilla
story
she
opened
the
door
wide
to
whoever
might
have
come
on
some
country
errand
and
looked
the
tired
and
laneway
full
in
the
face
dear
heart
come
in
she
exclaimed
reaching
out
and
taking
him
by
the
shoulder
as
he
stood
humbly
on
a
lower
step
come
right
in
joe
why
i
should
know
you
anywhere
why
joe
laneway
same
in
they
went
to
the
warm
bright
country
kitchen
the
delight
and
kindness
of
an
old
friend
welcome
and
her
instant
sympathy
seemed
the
loveliest
thing
in
the
world
they
sat
down
in
two
old
kitchen
chairs
they
still
held
each
other
by
the
hand
and
looked
in
each
other
face
the
plain
old
room
was
aglow
with
heat
and
cheerfulness
the
was
singing
a
drowsy
cat
sat
on
the
with
her
paws
tucked
in
and
the
house
dog
came
forward
in
a
friendly
way
wagging
his
tail
and
laid
his
head
on
their
clasped
hands
and
to
think
i
have
seen
you
since
your
folks
moved
out
west
the
next
spring
after
you
were
thirteen
in
the
winter
said
the
good
woman
but
i
there
ai
been
anybody
that
has
followed
your
career
closer
than
i
have
accordin
to
their
opportunities
done
a
great
work
for
your
country
joe
i
proud
of
you
clean
through
sometimes
folks
has
said
there
mis
hender
what
be
you
goin
to
say
now
but
i
always
told
to
wait
i
knew
you
saw
your
reasons
you
was
always
an
honest
boy
the
tears
started
and
shone
in
her
kind
eyes
her
face
showed
that
she
had
waged
a
bitter
war
with
poverty
and
sorrow
but
the
look
of
affection
that
it
wore
and
the
warm
touch
of
her
hard
hand
misshapen
and
worn
with
toil
touched
her
old
friend
in
his
inmost
heart
and
for
a
minute
neither
could
speak
they
do
say
that
women
folks
have
got
no
natural
head
for
politics
but
i
always
could
seem
to
sense
what
was
goin
on
in
washington
if
there
was
any
sense
to
it
said
grandmother
hender
at
last
nobody
could
puzzle
you
at
school
i
remember
answered
laneway
and
they
both
laughed
heartily
but
surely
this
granddaughter
does
not
make
your
household
you
have
sons
two
beside
her
father
he
died
but
they
both
away
up
toward
canada
buying
cattle
we
are
getting
along
considerable
well
these
last
few
years
since
they
got
a
mite
o
capital
together
but
the
old
farm
was
really
able
to
maintain
us
with
the
heavy
expenses
that
fell
on
us
unexpected
year
by
year

a
great
sight
of
trouble
joe
my
boy
john
marilla
father
and
his
nice
wife
i

early
when
marilla
was
but
a
child
john
was
the
flower
o
my
family
he
would
have
made
a
name
for
himself
you
would
have
taken
to
john
i
was
sorry
to
hear
of
your
loss
said
laneway
he
was
a
brave
man
i
know
what
he
did
at
fredericksburg
you
remember
that
i
lost
my
wife
and
my
only
son
there
was
a
silence
between
the
friends
who
had
no
need
for
words
now
they
understood
each
other
heart
only
too
well
marilla
who
sat
near
them
rose
and
went
out
of
the
room
yes
yes
daughter
said
hender
calling
her
back
we
ought
to
be
thinkin
about
supper
i
was
going
to
light
a
little
fire
in
the
parlor
explained
marilla
with
a
slight
tone
of
rebuke
in
her
clear
girlish
voice
oh
no
you
ai
not
now
at
least
protested
the
elder
woman
decidedly
now
joseph
what
should
you
like
to
have
for
supper
i
wish
to
my
heart
i
had
some
fried
turnovers
like
those
you
used
to
come
after
when
you
was
a
boy
i
can
make
just
about
the
same
as
mother
did
i
be
bound
you
thought
of
some
dish
that
you
relish
for
your
supper
rye
then
if
they
would
give
you
too
much
trouble
answered
the
honorable
joseph
with
prompt
seriousness
and
forget
some
cheese
he
looked
up
at
his
old
playfellow
as
she
stood
beside
him
eager
with
affectionate
hospitality
you
no
idea
what
a
comfort
marilla
been
she
stopped
to
whisper
always
took
right
hold
and
helped
me
when
she
was
a
baby
she
as
good
as
made
up
already
to
me
for
my
having
no
daughter
i
want
you
to
get
acquainted
with
marilla
the
granddaughter
was
still
awed
and
anxious
about
the
entertainment
of
so
distinguished
a
guest
when
her
grandmother
appeared
at
last
in
the
pantry
i
ai
goin
to
let
you
do
no
such
a
thing
darlin
said
abby
hender
when
marilla
spoke
of
making
something
that
she
called
fairy
gems
for
tea
after
a
new
and
essentially
feminine
recipe
you
just
let
me
get
supper
the
has
enough
kickshaws
to
eat
he
wants
a
good
hearty
supper
the
same
country
cooking
he
remembers
when
he
was
a
boy
he
went
so
far
himself
as
to
speak
of
rye
an
there
ai
one
in
a
hundred
nowadays
knows
how
to
make
the
kind
he
means
you
go
an
lay
the
table
just
as
we
always
have
it
except
you
can
get
out
them
old
big
sprigged
cups
o
my
mother
do
put
on
none
o
the
parlor
cluset
things
marilla
went
off
crestfallen
and
demurring
she
had
a
noble
desire
to
show
laneway
that
they
knew
how
to
have
things
as
well
as
anybody
and
was
sure
that
he
would
consider
it
more
polite
to
be
asked
into
the
best
room
and
to
sit
there
alone
until
tea
was
ready
but
the
illustrious
laneway
was
allowed
to
stay
in
the
kitchen
in
apparent
happiness
and
to
watch
the
proceedings
from
beginning
to
end
the
two
old
friends
talked
industriously
but
he
saw
his
rye
go
into
the
oven
and
come
out
and
his
tea
made
and
his
piece
of
salt
fish
broiled
and
buttered
a
broad
piece
of
honeycomb
set
on
to
match
some
delightful
thick
slices
of
loaf
bread
and
all
the
simple
feast
prepared
there
was
a
sufficient
piece
of
abby
hender
best
cheese
it
must
be
confessed
that
there
were
also
some
baked
beans
and
as
one
thing
after
another
appeared
the
honorable
joseph
laneway
grew
hungrier
and
hungrier
until
he
fairly
looked
pale
with
anticipation
and
delay
and
was
bidden
at
that
very
moment
to
draw
up
his
chair
and
make
himself
a
supper
if
he
could
what
cups
of
tea
what
uncounted
rye
went
to
the
making
of
that
successful
supper
how
gay
the
two
old
friends
became
and
of
what
old
stories
they
reminded
each
other
and
how
late
the
dark
spring
evening
grew
before
the
feast
was
over
and
the
chairs
were
set
against
the
kitchen
wall
marilla
listened
for
a
time
with
more
or
less
interest
but
at
last
she
took
one
of
her
with
slight
ostentation
and
went
over
to
study
by
the
lamp
hender
had
brought
her
a
blue
woolen
stocking
out
of
a
drawer
and
sat
down
serene
and
unruffled
prepared
to
keep
awake
as
late
as
possible
she
was
a
woman
who
had
kept
her
youthful
looks
through
the
difficulties
of
farm
life
as
few
women
can
and
this
added
to
her
guest
sense
of
homelikeness
and
pleasure
there
was
something
that
he
felt
to
be
sisterly
and
comfortable
in
her
strong
figure
he
even
noticed
the
little
plaid
woolen
shawl
that
she
wore
about
her
shoulders
dear
uncomplaining
heart
of
abby
hender
the
appealing
friendliness
of
the
good
woman
made
no
demands
except
to
be
allowed
to
help
and
to
serve
everybody
who
came
in
her
way
now
began
in
good
earnest
the
talk
of
old
times
and
what
had
become
of
this
and
that
old
schoolmate
how
one
family
had
come
to
want
and
another
to
wealth
the
changes
and
losses
and
windfalls
of
good
fortune
in
that
rural
neighborhood
were
made
tragedy
and
comedy
by
turns
in
abby
hender
dramatic
speech
she
grew
younger
and
more
entertaining
hour
by
hour
and
beguiled
the
grave
senator
into
confidential
talk
of
national
affairs
he
had
much
to
say
to
which
she
listened
with
rare
sympathy
and
intelligence
she
astonished
him
by
her
comprehension
of
difficult
questions
of
the
day
and
by
her
simple
good
sense
marilla
grew
hopelessly
sleepy
and
departed
but
neither
of
them
turned
to
notice
her
as
she
lingered
a
moment
at
the
door
to
say
when
the
immediate
subjects
of
conversation
were
fully
discussed
however
there
was
an
unexpected
interval
of
silence
and
after
making
sure
that
her
knitting
stitches
counted
exactly
right
abby
hender
cast
a
questioning
glance
at
the
senator
to
see
if
he
had
it
in
mind
to
go
to
bed
she
was
reluctant
to
end
her
evening
so
soon
but
determined
to
act
the
part
of
considerate
hostess
the
guest
was
as
wide
awake
as
ever
eleven
was
the
best
part
of
his
evening
cider
he
suggested
with
an
expectant
smile
and
abby
hender
was
on
her
feet
in
a
moment
when
she
had
brought
a
pitcher
from
the
pantry
he
took
a
candle
from
the
high
shelf
and
led
the
way
to
think
of
your
remembering
our
old
cellar
candlestick
all
these
years
laughed
the
pleased
woman
as
she
followed
him
down
the
steep
stairway
and
then
laughed
still
more
at
his
delight
in
the
familiar
look
of
the
place
unchanged
as
the
pyramids
he
said
i
suppose
those
pound
sweetings
that
used
to
be
in
that
farthest
bin
were
eaten
up
months
ago
it
was
plain
to
see
that
the
household
stores
were
waning
low
as
befitted
the
time
of
year
but
there
was
still
enough
in
the
old
cellar
care
and
thrift
and
gratitude
made
the
poor
farmhouse
a
rich
place
this
woman
of
real
ability
had
spent
her
strength
from
youth
to
age
and
had
lavished
as
much
industry
and
power
of
organization
in
her
narrow
sphere
as
would
have
made
her
famous
in
a
wider
one
joseph
laneway
could
not
help
sighing
as
he
thought
of
it
how
many
things
this
good
friend
had
missed
and
yet
how
much
she
had
been
able
to
win
that
makes
everywhere
the
very
best
of
life
poor
and
early
widowed
there
must
have
been
a
constant
battle
with
poverty
on
that
stony
harran
farm
whose
owners
had
been
pitied
even
in
his
early
boyhood
when
the
best
of
farming
life
was
none
too
easy
but
abby
hender
had
always
been
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
town
now
before
we
sit
down
again
i
want
you
to
step
into
my
best
room
perhaps
you
wo
have
time
in
the
morning
and
i
got
something
to
show
you
she
said
persuasively
it
was
a
plain
best
room
with
a
look
of
pleasantness
in
spite
of
the
spring
chill
and
the
stiffness
of
the
best
chairs
they
lingered
before
the
picture
of
hender
soldier
son
a
poor
work
of
a
poorer
artist
in
crayons
but
the
spirit
of
the
young
face
shone
out
appealingly
then
they
crossed
the
room
and
stood
before
some
bookshelves
and
abby
hender
face
brightened
into
a
beaming
smile
of
triumph
you
did
expect
we
should
have
all
those
books
now
did
you
joe
laneway
she
asked
he
shook
his
head
soberly
and
leaned
forward
to
read
the
titles
there
were
no
very
new
ones
as
if
times
had
been
hard
of
late
almost
every
volume
was
either
history
or
biography
or
travel
their
owner
had
reached
out
of
her
own
narrow
boundaries
into
other
lives
and
into
far
countries
he
recognized
with
gratitude
two
or
three
congressional
books
that
he
had
sent
her
when
he
first
went
to
washington
and
there
was
a
life
of
himself
written
from
a
partisan
point
of
view
and
issued
in
one
of
his
most
exciting
campaigns
the
sight
of
it
touched
him
to
the
heart
and
then
she
opened
it
and
showed
him
the
three
or
four
letters
that
he
had
written
her
one
in
boyish
handwriting
describing
his
adventures
on
his
first
western
journey
there
are
a
hundred
and
six
volumes
now
announced
the
proud
owner
of
such
a
library
i
lend
all
i
can
or
most
of
them
would
look
better
i
have
had
to
wait
a
good
while
for
some
and
some
what
i
expected
to
be
but
most
of
as
good
books
as
there
is
in
the
world
i
never
been
so
situated
that
it
seemed
best
for
me
to
indulge
in
a
daily
paper
and
i
do
know
but
it
just
as
well
but
stories
were
never
any
great
of
a
temptation
i
know
pretty
well
what
goin
on
about
me
and
i
can
make
that
do
real
interestin
enough
for
me
laneway
was
still
looking
over
the
books
his
heart
smote
him
for
not
being
thoughtful
he
knew
well
enough
that
the
overflow
of
his
own
library
would
have
been
delightful
to
this
soul
i
been
a
very
busy
man
all
my
life
abby
he
said
impulsively
as
if
she
waited
for
some
apology
for
his
forgetfulness
but
i
see
to
it
now
that
you
have
what
you
want
to
read
i
mean
to
lose
hold
of
your
advice
on
state
matters
they
both
laughed
and
he
added
i
always
thought
of
you
if
i
have
shown
it
there
more
time
to
read
than
there
used
to
be
i
had
what
was
best
for
me
answered
the
woman
gently
with
a
grateful
look
on
her
face
as
she
turned
to
glance
at
her
old
friend
marilla
takes
hold
wonderfully
and
helps
me
with
the
work
in
the
long
winter
evenings
you
ca
think
what
a
treat
a
new
book
is
i
would
change
places
with
the
queen
they
had
come
back
to
the
kitchen
and
she
stood
before
the
cupboard
reaching
high
for
two
old
gayly
striped
crockery
mugs
there
were
some
doughnuts
and
cheese
at
hand
their
early
supper
seemed
quite
forgotten
the
kitchen
was
warm
and
they
had
talked
themselves
thirsty
and
hungry
but
with
what
an
unexpected
tang
the
cider
freshened
their
throats
hender
had
picked
the
apples
herself
that
went
to
the
press
they
were
all
chosen
from
the
old
russet
tree
and
the
gnarly
ungrafted
fruit
that
grew
along
the
lane
the
flavor
made
one
think
of
frosty
autumn
mornings
on
high
hillsides
of
north
winds
and
sunny
skies
it
one
to
the
heart
as
hender
remarked
proudly
when
the
senator
tried
to
praise
it
as
much
as
it
deserved
and
finally
gave
a
cheerful
laugh
such
as
he
had
not
laughed
for
many
a
day
why
it
seems
like
drinking
the
month
of
october
he
told
her
and
at
this
the
hostess
reached
over
protesting
that
the
striped
mug
was
too
narrow
to
hold
what
it
ought
and
filled
it
up
again
oh
joe
laneway
to
think
that
i
see
you
at
last
after
all
these
years
she
said
how
rich
i
shall
feel
with
this
evening
to
live
over
i
always
wanted
to
see
somebody
that
i
read
about
and
now
i
got
that
to
remember
but
i
always
known
i
should
see
you
again
and
i
believe
was
the
lord
will
early
the
next
morning
they
said
the
early
breakfast
had
to
be
hurried
and
marilla
was
to
drive
laneway
to
the
station
three
miles
away
it
was
saturday
morning
and
she
was
free
from
school
laneway
strolled
down
the
lane
before
breakfast
was
ready
and
came
back
with
a
little
bunch
of
pink
anemones
in
his
hand
marilla
thought
that
he
meant
to
give
them
to
her
but
he
laid
them
beside
her
grandmother
plate
you
must
put
those
in
your
desk
he
said
with
a
smile
and
abby
hender
blushed
like
a
girl
i
got
those
others
now
dried
and
put
away
somewhere
in
one
of
my
books
she
said
quietly
and
marilla
wondered
what
they
meant
the
two
old
friends
shook
hands
warmly
at
parting
i
wish
you
could
have
stayed
another
day
so
i
could
have
had
the
minister
come
and
see
you
urged
hender
regretfully
you
could
have
done
any
more
for
me
i
have
had
the
best
visit
in
the
world
he
answered
a
little
shaken
and
holding
her
hand
a
moment
longer
while
marilla
sat
young
and
impatient
in
the
high
wagon
you
a
dear
good
woman
abby
sometimes
when
things
have
gone
wrong
i
been
sorry
that
i
ever
had
to
leave
winby
the
woman
clear
eyes
looked
straight
into
his
then
fell
you
would
have
done
everything
you
have
for
the
country
she
said
give
me
a
kiss
we
getting
to
be
old
folks
now
said
the
general
and
they
kissed
each
other
gravely
a
moment
later
abby
hender
stood
alone
in
her
dooryard
watching
and
waving
her
hand
again
and
again
while
the
wagon
rattled
away
down
the
lane
and
turned
into
the
two
hours
after
marilla
returned
from
the
station
and
rushed
into
the
kitchen
grandma
she
exclaimed
you
never
did
see
such
a
crowd
in
winby
as
there
was
at
the
depot
everybody
in
town
had
got
word
about
general
laneway
and
they
were
pushing
up
to
shake
hands
and
cheering
same
as
at
election
and
the
cars
waited
much
as
ten
minutes
and
all
the
folks
was
lookin
out
of
the
windows
and
came
out
on
the
platforms
when
they
heard
who
it
was
folks
say
that
he
been
to
see
the
selectmen
yesterday
before
he
came
to
school
and
he
goin
to
build
an
elegant
town
hall
and
have
the
names
put
up
in
it
of
all
the
winby
men
that
went
to
the
war
marilla
sank
into
a
chair
flushed
with
excitement
everybody
was
asking
me
about
his
being
here
last
night
and
what
he
said
to
the
school
i
wished
that
you
gone
down
to
the
depot
instead
of
me
i
had
the
best
part
of
anybody
said
hender
smiling
and
going
on
with
her
saturday
morning
work
i
real
glad
they
showed
him
proper
respect
she
added
a
moment
afterward
but
her
voice
faltered
why
you
ai
been
cryin
grandma
asked
the
girl
i
guess
tired
you
had
a
real
good
time
now
did
you
yes
dear
heart
said
abby
hender
ai
pleasant
to
be
old
that
all
i
could
help
noticin
his
age
as
he
rode
away
i
always
been
lookin
forward
to
seein
him
again
an
now
it
all
over
back
on
in
giving
this
brief
account
of
my
childhood
or
to
speak
exactly
of
the
surroundings
which
have
affected
the
course
of
my
work
as
a
writer
my
first
thought
flies
back
to
those
who
taught
me
to
observe
and
to
know
the
deep
pleasures
of
simple
things
and
to
be
interested
in
the
lives
of
people
about
me
with
its
high
hills
and
pine
forests
and
all
its
ponds
and
brooks
and
distant
mountain
views
there
are
few
such
delightful
country
towns
in
new
england
as
the
one
where
i
was
born
being
one
of
the
oldest
colonial
settlements
it
is
full
of
interesting
traditions
and
relics
of
the
early
inhabitants
both
indians
and
englishmen
two
large
rivers
join
just
below
the
village
at
the
head
of
and
these
with
the
great
inflow
from
the
sea
make
a
magnificent
stream
bordered
on
its
seaward
course
now
by
banks
of
dark
pines
and
hemlocks
and
again
by
lovely
green
fields
that
slope
gently
to
long
lines
of
willows
at
the
water
edge
there
is
pleasure
in
making
one
self
familiar
with
such
a
region
one
may
travel
at
home
in
a
most
literal
sense
and
be
always
learning
history
geography
botany
or
biography
whatever
one
chooses
i
have
had
a
good
deal
of
journeying
in
my
life
and
taken
great
delight
in
it
but
i
have
never
taken
greater
delight
than
in
my
rides
and
drives
and
tramps
and
voyages
within
the
borders
of
my
native
town
there
is
always
something
fresh
something
to
be
traced
or
discovered
something
particularly
to
be
remembered
one
grows
rich
in
memories
and
associations
i
believe
that
we
should
know
our
native
towns
much
better
than
most
of
us
do
and
never
let
ourselves
be
strangers
at
home
particularly
when
one
native
place
is
so
really
interesting
as
my
own
above
the
two
rivers
are
barred
by
successive
falls
you
hear
the
noise
of
them
by
night
in
the
village
like
the
sound
of
the
sea
and
this
fine
water
power
so
near
the
coast
beside
a
great
salmon
fishery
famous
among
the
indians
brought
the
first
english
settlers
to
the
town
in
i
know
some
families
who
still
live
upon
the
lands
which
their
ancestors
bought
from
the
indians
and
their
single
deed
bears
the
queer
barbaric
signatures
there
are
many
things
to
remind
one
of
these
early
settlers
beside
the
old
farms
upon
which
they
and
their
descendants
have
lived
for
six
or
seven
generations
one
is
a
quaint
fashion
of
speech
which
survives
among
the
neighborhoods
in
words
and
phrases
common
in
england
in
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
one
curious
thing
is
the
pronunciation
of
the
name
of
the
town
berwick
by
the
elder
people
has
always
been
called
after
the
fashion
of
danes
and
northmen
never
as
the
word
has
so
long
been
pronounced
in
modern
england
the
descendants
of
the
first
comers
to
the
town
have
often
been
distinguished
in
the
affairs
of
their
time
no
village
of
its
size
in
new
england
could
boast
particularly
in
the
early
part
of
the
present
century
of
a
larger
number
of
men
and
women
who
kept
themselves
more
closely
in
touch
with
the
best
that
has
been
thought
and
said
in
the
world
as
i
write
this
i
keep
in
mind
the
truth
that
i
have
no
inheritance
from
the
ancient
worth
and
dignity
of
berwick
or
what
is
now
north
berwick
in
maine
my
own
people
are
comparatively
late
comers
i
was
born
in
a
pleasant
old
colonial
house
built
near
and
bought
by
my
grandfather
sixty
or
seventy
years
ago
when
he
brought
his
household
up
the
river
to
berwick
from
portsmouth
he
was
a
and
had
run
away
to
sea
in
his
boyhood
and
led
a
most
adventurous
life
but
was
quite
ready
to
forsake
seafaring
in
his
early
manhood
and
at
last
joined
a
group
of
acquaintances
who
were
engaged
in
the
flourishing
west
india
trade
of
that
time
for
many
years
he
kept
and
extended
his
interests
in
shipping
building
ships
and
buying
large
quantities
of
timber
from
the
northward
and
eastward
and
sending
it
down
the
river
and
so
to
sea
this
business
was
still
in
existence
in
my
early
childhood
and
the
manner
of
its
conduct
was
primitive
enough
the
barter
system
still
prevailing
by
force
of
necessity
those
who
brought
the
huge
sticks
of
oak
and
pine
timber
for
masts
and
planks
were
rarely
paid
in
money
which
was
of
comparatively
little
use
in
remote
and
sparsely
settled
districts
when
the
sleds
and
long
trains
of
yoked
oxen
returned
from
the
river
wharves
to
the
stores
they
took
a
lighter
load
in
exchange
of
flour
and
rice
and
barrels
of
molasses
of
sugar
and
salt
and
cotton
cloth
and
raisins
and
spices
and
tea
and
coffee
in
fact
all
the
household
necessities
and
luxuries
that
the
northern
farms
could
not
supply
they
liked
to
have
a
little
money
with
which
to
pay
their
taxes
and
their
parish
dues
if
they
were
so
fortunate
as
to
be
parishioners
but
they
needed
very
little
money
besides
so
i
came
in
contact
with
the
people
as
well
as
with
the
sailors
and
shipmasters
of
the
other
side
of
the
business
i
used
to
linger
about
the
busy
country
stores
and
listen
to
the
graphic
country
talk
i
heard
the
greetings
of
old
friends
and
their
minute
details
of
neighborhood
affairs
their
delightful
jokes
and
reports
of
tracts
of
ever
so
many
feet
through
at
the
butt
when
the
great
teams
came
in
sight
at
the
head
of
the
village
street
i
ran
to
meet
them
over
the
creaking
snow
if
possible
to
mount
and
ride
into
town
in
triumph
but
it
was
not
many
years
before
i
began
to
feel
sorry
at
the
sight
of
every
huge
lopped
stem
of
oak
or
pine
that
came
trailing
along
after
the
frosted
oxen
such
trees
are
unreplaceable
i
only
know
of
one
small
group
now
in
all
this
part
of
the
country
of
those
great
timber
pines
my
young
ears
were
quick
to
hear
the
news
of
a
ship
having
come
into
port
and
i
delighted
in
the
elderly
captains
with
their
faces
who
came
to
report
upon
their
voyages
dining
cheerfully
and
heartily
with
my
grandfather
who
listened
eagerly
to
their
exciting
tales
of
great
storms
on
the
atlantic
and
winds
that
blew
them
and
good
bargains
in
havana
or
barbadoes
or
havre
i
listened
as
eagerly
as
any
one
this
is
the
charming
way
in
which
i
was
taught
something
of
a
fashion
of
life
already
on
the
wane
and
of
that
subsistence
upon
sea
and
forest
bounties
which
is
now
almost
a
forgotten
thing
in
my
part
of
new
england
much
freight
still
came
and
went
by
the
river
gundelows
and
packets
long
after
the
railroad
had
made
such
changes
and
every
village
along
its
line
lost
its
old
feeling
of
in
my
home
the
greater
part
of
the
minor
furnishings
had
come
over
in
the
ships
from
bristol
and
havre
my
grandfather
seemed
to
be
a
citizen
of
the
whole
geography
i
was
always
listening
to
stories
of
three
wars
from
older
people
the
siege
of
louisburg
the
revolution
in
which
my
father
ancestors
had
been
honest
but
mistaken
tories
and
in
which
my
mother
the
gilmans
of
exeter
had
taken
a
nobler
part
as
for
the
war
of
the
last
war
as
everybody
called
it
it
was
a
thing
of
yesterday
in
the
town
one
of
the
famous
privateer
crews
was
gathered
along
our
own
river
shore
and
one
member
of
the
crew
in
his
old
age
had
been
my
father
patient
the
berwick
people
were
great
patriots
and
were
naturally
proud
of
the
famous
sullivans
who
were
born
in
the
upper
part
of
the
town
and
came
to
be
governors
and
judge
and
general
i
often
heard
about
lafayette
who
had
made
an
visit
in
order
to
see
again
some
old
friends
who
lived
in
the
town
the
name
of
a
famous
colonel
hamilton
the
leader
in
the
last
century
of
the
west
india
trade
and
the
histories
of
the
old
berwick
houses
of
chadbourn
and
lord
were
delightfully
familiar
and
one
of
the
traditions
of
the
latter
family
is
more
than
good
enough
to
be
told
again
there
was
a
berwick
lad
who
went
out
on
one
of
the
privateers
that
sailed
from
portsmouth
in
the
revolution
the
vessel
was
taken
by
a
british
frigate
and
the
crew
put
in
irons
one
day
one
of
the
english
midshipmen
stood
near
these
prisoners
as
they
took
their
airing
on
deck
and
spoke
contemptuously
about
the
rebels
young
lord
heard
what
he
said
and
turned
himself
about
to
say
boldly
if
it
were
not
for
your
rank
sir
i
would
make
you
take
that
back
no
matter
about
my
rank
said
the
gallant
middy
if
you
can
whip
me
you
are
welcome
to
so
they
had
a
capital
good
fight
standing
over
a
as
proud
tradition
tells
and
the
berwick
sailor
was
the
better
fighter
of
the
two
and
won
the
englishman
shook
hands
and
asked
his
name
and
promised
not
to
forget
him
which
was
certainly
most
handsome
behavior
when
they
reached
an
english
port
all
the
prisoners
but
one
were
sent
away
under
guard
to
join
the
other
american
prisoners
of
war
but
the
admiral
sent
for
a
young
man
named
nathan
lord
and
told
him
that
his
grace
the
duke
of
clarence
son
of
his
majesty
the
king
begged
for
his
pardon
and
had
left
a
note
at
his
disposal
this
was
not
the
first
or
last
berwick
lad
who
proved
himself
of
good
courage
in
a
fight
but
there
never
was
another
to
whip
a
future
king
of
england
and
moreover
to
be
liked
the
better
for
it
by
that
fine
gentleman
my
grandfather
died
in
my
eleventh
year
and
presently
the
civil
war
began
from
that
time
the
simple
village
life
was
at
an
end
its
provincial
character
was
fading
out
shipping
was
at
a
disadvantage
and
there
were
no
more
bronzed
coming
to
dine
and
talk
about
their
voyages
no
more
bags
of
filberts
or
oranges
for
the
children
or
great
red
jars
of
olives
but
in
these
childish
years
i
had
come
in
contact
with
many
delightful
men
and
women
of
real
individuality
and
breadth
of
character
who
had
fought
the
battle
of
life
to
good
advantage
and
sometimes
against
great
odds
in
these
days
i
was
given
to
long
childish
illnesses
and
it
must
be
honestly
confessed
to
instant
drooping
if
ever
i
were
shut
up
in
school
i
had
apparently
not
the
slightest
desire
for
learning
but
my
father
was
always
ready
to
let
me
be
his
companion
in
long
drives
about
the
country
in
my
grandfather
business
household
my
father
unconscious
of
tonnage
and
timber
measurement
of
the
markets
of
the
windward
islands
or
the
mediterranean
ports
had
taken
to
his
book
as
old
people
said
and
gone
to
college
and
begun
that
devotion
to
the
study
of
medicine
which
only
ended
with
his
life
i
have
tried
already
to
give
some
idea
of
my
father
character
in
my
story
of
the
country
doctor
but
all
that
is
inadequate
to
the
gifts
and
character
of
the
man
himself
he
gave
me
my
first
and
best
knowledge
of
books
by
his
own
delight
and
dependence
upon
them
and
ruled
my
early
attempts
at
writing
by
the
severity
and
simplicity
of
his
own
good
taste
do
try
to
write
people
and
things
tell
them
just
as
they
are
how
often
my
young
ears
heard
these
words
without
comprehending
them
but
while
i
was
too
young
and
thoughtless
to
share
in
an
enthusiasm
for
sterne
or
fielding
and
smollett
or
don
quixote
my
mother
and
grandmother
were
leading
me
into
the
pleasant
ways
of
pride
and
prejudice
and
the
scenes
of
clerical
life
and
the
delightful
stories
of
oliphant
the
old
house
was
well
provided
with
books
of
a
deeply
serious
nature
but
in
my
youthful
appetite
for
knowledge
i
could
even
in
the
driest
find
something
vital
and
in
the
more
entertaining
i
was
completely
lost
my
father
had
inherited
from
his
father
an
amazing
knowledge
of
human
nature
and
from
his
mother
french
ancestry
that
peculiarly
french
trait
called
de
through
all
the
heavy
responsibilities
and
anxieties
of
his
busy
professional
life
this
kept
him
young
at
heart
and
cheerful
his
visits
to
his
patients
were
often
made
perfectly
delightful
and
refreshing
to
them
by
his
kind
heart
and
the
charm
of
his
personality
i
knew
many
of
the
patients
whom
he
used
to
visit
in
lonely
inland
farms
or
on
the
seacoast
in
york
and
wells
i
used
to
follow
him
about
silently
like
an
undemanding
little
dog
content
to
follow
at
his
heels
i
had
no
consciousness
of
watching
or
listening
or
indeed
of
any
special
interest
in
the
country
interiors
in
fact
when
the
time
came
that
my
own
world
of
imaginations
was
more
real
to
me
than
any
other
i
was
sometimes
perplexed
at
my
father
directing
my
attention
to
certain
points
of
interest
in
the
character
or
surroundings
of
our
acquaintances
i
can
not
help
believing
that
he
recognized
long
before
i
did
myself
in
what
direction
the
current
of
purpose
in
my
life
was
setting
now
as
i
write
my
sketches
of
country
life
i
remember
again
and
again
the
wise
things
he
said
and
the
sights
he
made
me
see
he
was
only
impatient
with
affectation
and
insincerity
i
may
have
inherited
something
of
my
father
and
knowledge
of
human
nature
but
my
father
never
lost
a
chance
of
trying
to
teach
me
to
observe
i
owe
a
great
deal
to
his
patience
with
a
heedless
little
girl
given
far
more
to
dreams
than
to
accuracy
and
with
perhaps
too
little
natural
sympathy
for
the
dreams
of
others
the
quiet
village
life
the
dull
routine
of
farming
or
mill
life
early
became
interesting
to
me
i
was
taught
to
find
everything
that
an
imaginative
child
could
ask
in
the
simple
scenes
close
at
hand
i
say
these
things
eagerly
because
i
long
to
impress
upon
every
boy
and
girl
this
truth
that
it
is
not
one
surroundings
that
can
help
or
hinder
it
is
having
a
growing
purpose
in
one
life
to
make
the
most
of
whatever
is
in
one
reach
if
you
have
but
a
few
good
books
learn
those
to
the
very
heart
of
them
do
for
one
moment
believe
that
if
you
had
different
surroundings
and
opportunities
you
would
find
the
upward
path
any
easier
to
climb
one
condition
is
like
another
if
you
have
not
the
determination
and
the
power
to
grow
in
yourself
i
was
still
a
child
when
i
began
to
write
down
the
things
i
was
thinking
about
but
at
first
i
always
made
rhymes
and
found
prose
so
difficult
that
a
school
composition
was
a
terror
to
me
and
i
do
not
remember
ever
writing
one
that
was
worth
anything
but
in
course
of
time
rhymes
themselves
became
difficult
and
prose
more
and
more
enticing
and
i
began
my
work
in
life
most
happy
in
finding
that
i
was
to
write
of
those
country
characters
and
rural
landscapes
to
which
i
myself
belonged
and
which
i
had
been
taught
to
love
with
all
my
heart
i
was
between
nineteen
and
twenty
when
my
first
sketch
was
accepted
by
howells
for
the
i
already
counted
myself
as
by
no
means
a
new
contributor
to
one
or
two
other
magazines
and
but
i
had
no
literary
friends
at
court
i
was
very
shy
about
speaking
of
my
work
at
home
and
even
sent
it
to
the
magazine
under
an
assumed
name
and
then
was
timid
about
asking
the
for
those
mysterious
and
exciting
editorial
letters
which
she
announced
upon
the
list
as
if
i
were
a
stranger
in
the
town
passing
of
sister
mercy
crane
was
of
such
firm
persuasion
that
a
house
is
meant
to
be
lived
in
that
during
many
years
she
was
never
known
to
leave
her
own
neat
on
the
ridge
road
yet
being
very
fond
of
company
in
pleasant
weather
she
often
sat
in
the
side
doorway
looking
out
on
her
green
yard
where
the
grass
grew
short
and
thick
and
was
undisfigured
even
by
a
path
toward
the
steps
all
her
faded
green
blinds
were
securely
tied
together
and
knotted
on
the
inside
by
pieces
of
white
tape
but
now
and
then
when
the
sun
was
not
too
hot
for
her
carpets
she
opened
one
window
at
a
time
for
a
few
hours
having
pronounced
views
upon
the
necessity
of
light
and
air
although
crane
was
acknowledged
by
her
best
friends
to
be
a
peculiar
person
and
very
set
in
her
ways
she
was
much
respected
and
one
acquaintance
vied
with
another
in
making
up
for
her
melancholy
seclusion
by
bringing
her
all
the
news
they
could
gather
she
had
been
left
alone
many
years
before
by
the
sudden
death
of
her
husband
from
sunstroke
and
though
she
was
by
no
means
poor
she
had
as
some
one
said
such
a
pretty
way
of
taking
a
little
present
that
you
help
being
pleased
when
you
gave
her
anything
for
a
lover
of
society
such
a
life
must
have
had
its
difficulties
at
times
except
that
the
ridge
road
was
more
traveled
than
any
other
in
the
township
and
crane
had
invented
a
system
of
signals
to
which
she
always
resorted
in
case
of
wishing
to
speak
to
some
one
of
her
neighbors
the
afternoon
was
wearing
late
one
day
toward
the
end
of
summer
and
mercy
crane
sat
in
her
doorway
dressed
in
a
favorite
light
calico
and
a
small
shoulder
shawl
figured
with
large
palm
leaves
she
was
making
some
tatting
of
a
somewhat
intricate
pattern
she
believed
it
to
be
the
prettiest
and
most
durable
of
trimmings
and
having
decorated
her
own
wardrobe
in
the
course
of
unlimited
leisure
she
was
now
making
a
few
yards
apiece
for
each
of
her
more
intimate
friends
so
that
they
might
have
something
to
remember
her
by
she
kept
glancing
up
the
road
as
if
she
expected
some
one
but
the
time
went
slowly
by
until
at
last
a
woman
appeared
to
view
walking
fast
and
carrying
a
large
bundle
in
a
checked
handkerchief
then
mercy
crane
worked
steadily
for
a
short
time
without
looking
up
until
the
desired
friend
was
crossing
the
grass
between
the
dusty
road
and
the
steps
the
visitor
was
out
of
breath
and
did
not
respond
to
the
polite
greeting
of
her
hostess
until
she
had
recovered
herself
to
her
satisfaction
crane
made
her
the
kind
offer
of
a
glass
of
water
or
a
few
peppermints
but
was
answered
only
by
a
shake
of
the
head
so
she
resumed
her
work
for
a
time
until
the
silence
should
be
broken
i
have
come
from
the
house
of
mourning
said
sarah
ellen
dow
at
last
unexpectedly
you
do
tell
me
that
sister
barsett
she
left
us
this
time
she
really
gone
and
the
excited
burst
into
tears
the
poor
soul
was
completely
overwrought
she
looked
tired
and
wan
as
if
she
had
spent
her
forces
in
sympathy
as
well
as
hard
work
she
felt
in
her
great
bundle
for
a
pocket
handkerchief
but
was
not
successful
in
the
search
and
finally
produced
a
faded
gingham
apron
with
long
narrow
strings
with
which
she
hastily
dried
her
tears
the
sad
news
appealed
also
to
mercy
crane
who
looked
across
to
the
and
could
not
see
them
for
a
dazzle
of
tears
in
her
own
eyes
the
spectacle
of
sarah
ellen
dow
going
home
with
her
humble
workaday
possessions
from
the
house
where
she
had
gone
in
haste
only
a
few
days
before
to
care
for
a
sick
person
well
known
to
them
both
was
a
very
sad
sight
you
sent
word
yesterday
that
you
should
be
returnin
early
this
afternoon
and
would
stop
i
presume
i
received
the
message
as
you
gave
it
asked
crane
who
was
tenacious
in
such
matters
but
i
do
declare
i
never
looked
to
hear
she
was
gone
she
been
failin
right
along
sence
yisterday
about
this
time
said
the
nurse
she
taken
no
notice
to
speak
of
an
been
eatin
the
vally
o
nothin
i
may
say
sence
i
went
there
her
sisters
both
come
back
yisterday
an
of
course
i
was
expected
to
give
up
charge
to
them
they
used
to
sickness
an
both
havin
such
a
name
for
bein
great
housekeepers
sarah
ellen
spoke
with
bitterness
but
crane
was
reminded
instantly
of
her
own
affairs
i
feel
condemned
that
i
ai
begun
my
own
fall
cleanin
yet
she
said
with
an
ostentatious
sigh
plenty
o
time
to
worry
about
that
her
friend
hastened
to
console
her
i
do
desire
to
have
everything
decent
about
my
house
resumed
crane
there
nobody
to
do
anything
but
me
if
i
was
to
be
taken
away
sudden
myself
i
should
want
to
have
it
said
afterwards
that
there
was
wisps
under
my
sofy
or
there
i
ca
dwell
on
my
own
troubles
with
sister
barsett
loss
right
before
me
i
ca
seem
to
believe
she
really
passed
away
she
always
was
saying
she
should
go
in
some
o
these
spells
but
i
deemed
her
to
be
troubled
with
narves
sarah
ellen
dow
shook
her
head
i
all
nerved
up
myself
she
said
brokenly
i
made
light
of
her
sickness
when
i
went
there
first
seen
her
what
she
called
dreadful
low
so
many
times
but
i
saw
her
looks
this
morning
an
i
begun
to
believe
her
at
last
them
sisters
o
hers
is
the
master
for
unfeelin
hearts
sister
barsett
was
there
yisterday
an
one
of
was
right
by
her
tellin
how
difficult
was
for
her
to
leave
home
her
niece
was
goin
to
graduate
to
the
high
school
an
they
was
goin
to
have
a
time
in
the
evening
an
all
the
exercises
promised
to
be
extry
interesting
poor
sister
barsett
knew
what
she
said
an
looked
at
her
with
contempt
an
then
she
give
a
glance
at
me
an
closed
up
her
eyes
as
if
was
for
the
last
time
i
know
she
felt
it
sarah
ellen
dow
was
more
and
more
excited
by
a
sense
of
bitter
grievance
her
rule
of
the
afflicted
household
had
evidently
been
interfered
with
she
was
not
accustomed
to
be
ignored
and
set
aside
at
such
times
her
simple
nature
and
uncommon
ability
found
satisfaction
in
the
exercise
of
authority
but
she
had
now
left
her
post
feeling
hurt
and
wronged
besides
knowing
something
of
the
pain
of
honest
affliction
if
it
had
been
for
esteemin
sister
barsett
as
i
always
have
done
i
should
have
told
no
an
held
to
it
when
they
asked
me
to
come
back
an
watch
ai
for
none
o
their
sakes
but
sister
barsett
was
a
good
friend
to
me
in
her
way
sarah
ellen
broke
down
once
more
and
felt
in
her
bundle
again
hastily
but
the
handkerchief
was
again
elusive
while
a
small
object
fell
out
upon
the
doorstep
with
a
bounce
ai
nothin
but
a
little
i
spared
out
o
the
loaf
i
baked
this
mornin
she
explained
with
a
blush
i
was
so
shoved
out
that
i
seemed
to
want
to
turn
my
hand
to
somethin
useful
an
feel
i
was
still
doin
for
sister
barsett
try
a
little
piece
wo
you
mis
crane
i
thought
it
seemed
light
an
good
they
shared
the
with
serious
enjoyment
and
pronounced
it
very
good
indeed
when
they
had
finished
and
shaken
the
crumbs
out
of
their
laps
there
nobody
but
you
shall
come
an
do
for
me
at
the
last
if
i
can
have
my
way
about
things
said
mercy
crane
impulsively
she
meant
it
for
a
tribute
to
miss
dow
character
and
general
ability
and
as
such
it
was
meekly
accepted
you
a
younger
person
than
i
be
an
less
wore
said
sarah
ellen
but
she
felt
better
now
that
she
had
rested
and
her
conversational
powers
seemed
to
be
refreshed
by
her
share
of
the
little
cake
doctor
bangs
has
behaved
real
pretty
i
can
say
that
she
continued
presently
in
a
mournful
tone
heretofore
in
the
sickness
of
sister
barsett
i
have
always
felt
to
hope
certain
that
she
would
survive
she
recovered
from
a
sight
things
in
her
day
she
has
been
the
first
to
have
all
the
new
diseases
that
visited
this
region
i
know
she
had
the
spinal
mergeetis
months
before
there
was
any
other
case
about
observed
crane
with
satisfaction
an
the
new
throat
troubles
all
of
agreed
sarah
ellen
has
made
trial
of
all
the
best
patent
medicines
an
could
tell
you
their
merits
as
no
one
else
could
in
this
vicinity
she
never
was
one
that
depended
on
herbs
alone
though
she
considered
extremely
useful
in
some
cases
everybody
has
their
herb
as
we
know
but
free
to
say
that
sister
barsett
sometimes
done
everything
she
could
to
kill
herself
with
such
rovin
ways
o
dosin
she
must
see
it
now
she
gone
an
ca
stuff
down
no
more
invigorators
sarah
ellen
dow
burst
out
suddenly
with
this
as
if
she
could
no
longer
contain
her
honest
opinion
there
there
you
all
worked
up
answered
placid
mercy
crane
looking
more
interested
than
ever
an
she
was
dreadful
handy
to
talk
religion
to
other
folks
but
come
to
a
realizin
sense
that
religion
is
somethin
besides
opinions
she
an
elder
french
has
been
mostly
of
one
mind
but
i
do
they
got
hold
of
all
the
religion
there
is
why
why
sarah
ellen
exclaimed
crane
but
there
was
still
something
in
her
tone
that
urged
the
speaker
to
further
expression
of
her
feelings
the
good
creature
was
much
excited
her
face
was
clouded
with
disapproval
i
ai
forgettin
nothin
about
their
good
points
either
she
went
on
in
a
more
subdued
tone
and
suddenly
stopped
preachin
be
done
away
with
soon
or
late
preachin
o
elder
french
kind
announced
mercy
crane
after
waiting
to
see
if
her
guest
did
not
mean
to
say
anything
more
i
should
like
to
read
out
that
verse
another
fashion
ye
doers
o
the
word
not
preachers
only
would
hit
it
about
right
but
there
it
easy
for
all
of
us
to
talk
in
my
early
days
i
used
to
like
to
get
out
to
meetin
regular
because
sure
as
i
did
i
had
bad
luck
all
the
week
i
did
feel
pacified
i
been
half
a
day
but
i
was
out
all
day
the
sabbath
before
barlow
died
as
he
did
so
you
mean
to
say
that
sister
barsett
really
gone
crane
tone
changed
to
one
of
real
concern
and
her
manner
indicated
that
she
had
put
the
preceding
conversation
behind
her
with
decision
she
was
herself
to
the
last
instantly
responded
miss
dow
i
see
her
put
out
a
thumb
an
finger
from
under
the
spread
an
pinch
up
a
fold
of
her
sister
deckett
dress
to
try
an
see
if
was
all
wool
i
thought
all
wool
myself
an
i
know
it
now
by
the
way
she
looked
she
was
a
very
knowin
person
about
materials
we
shall
miss
poor
mis
barsett
in
many
ways
she
was
always
the
one
to
consult
with
about
matters
o
dress
she
passed
away
easy
at
the
last
i
hope
asked
crane
with
interest
why
i
there
if
you
believe
it
exclaimed
sarah
ellen
flushing
and
looking
at
her
friend
for
sympathy
sister
barsett
revived
up
the
first
o
the
afternoon
an
they
sent
for
elder
french
she
took
notice
of
him
and
he
exhorted
quite
a
spell
an
then
he
spoke
o
there
being
need
of
air
in
the
room
mis
deckett
closed
every
window
an
she
asked
me
of
all
folks
if
i
had
better
step
out
but
elder
french
come
too
an
he
was
very
reasonable
had
a
word
with
me
about
mis
deckett
an
mis
peak
an
the
way
they
was
workin
things
i
told
him
right
out
how
they
never
come
near
when
the
rest
of
us
was
havin
it
so
hard
with
her
along
in
the
spring
but
now
they
thought
she
was
goin
to
die
they
come
settlin
down
like
a
pair
o
old
crows
in
a
field
to
pick
for
what
they
could
get
i
just
made
up
my
mind
they
should
have
all
the
care
if
they
wanted
it
it
did
seem
as
if
there
was
anything
more
i
could
do
for
sister
barsett
an
i
set
there
in
the
kitchen
within
call
an
waited
when
i
heard
sayin
she
gone
she
gone
and
deckett
i
put
on
my
bunnit
and
stepped
myself
out
into
the
road
i
felt
to
repent
after
i
had
gone
but
a
rod
but
i
was
so
worked
up
an
i
thought
they
call
me
back
an
then
i
was
put
out
because
they
did
an
so
here
i
be
i
ca
help
it
now
sarah
ellen
was
crying
again
she
and
crane
could
not
look
at
each
other
well
you
set
an
rest
said
crane
kindly
and
with
the
merest
shadow
of
disapproval
you
set
an
rest
an
by
an
by
if
you
feel
better
you
could
go
back
an
just
make
a
little
stop
an
inquire
about
the
arrangements
i
would
harbor
no
feelin
if
they
be
inconsiderate
folks
sister
barsett
has
often
deplored
their
actions
in
my
hearing
an
wished
she
had
sisters
like
other
folks
with
all
her
faults
she
was
a
useful
person
an
a
good
neighbor
mourned
mercy
crane
sincerely
she
was
one
that
always
had
somethin
interestin
to
tell
an
if
it
for
her
dyin
spells
an
all
that
sort
nonsense
she
make
a
figger
in
the
world
she
would
so
she
walked
with
an
air
always
mis
barsett
did
you
ask
who
she
was
if
you
had
known
as
she
passed
you
by
how
quick
we
forget
the
outs
about
anybody
that
gone
but
i
always
feel
grateful
to
anybody
friendly
situated
as
i
be
i
shall
miss
her
runnin
over
i
can
seem
to
see
her
now
coming
over
the
rise
in
the
road
but
do
you
get
in
a
way
of
takin
things
too
hard
sarah
ellen
you
worked
yourself
all
to
pieces
since
i
saw
you
last
you
gettin
to
be
as
lean
as
a
fly
now
you
comin
in
to
have
a
cup
o
tea
with
me
an
then
you
feel
better
i
got
some
new
molasses
gingerbread
that
i
baked
this
mornin
i
do
feel
beat
out
mis
crane
acknowledged
the
poor
little
soul
glad
of
a
chance
to
speak
but
touched
by
this
unexpected
mark
of
consideration
if
i
could
ha
done
as
i
wanted
to
i
should
be
well
enough
but
to
be
set
aside
an
ordered
about
where
i
taken
the
lead
in
sickness
so
much
an
knew
how
to
deal
with
sister
barsett
so
well
she
might
be
livin
now
perhaps
come
we
better
go
in
is
gettin
damp
and
the
mistress
of
the
house
rose
so
hurriedly
as
to
seem
bustling
do
dwell
on
sister
barsett
an
her
foolish
folks
no
more
i
would
if
i
was
you
they
went
into
the
front
room
which
was
dim
with
the
twilight
of
the
blinds
and
two
great
syringa
bushes
that
grew
against
them
sarah
ellen
put
down
her
bundle
and
bestowed
herself
in
the
large
crane
directed
her
to
stay
there
awhile
and
rest
and
then
come
out
into
the
kitchen
when
she
got
ready
a
cheerful
clatter
of
dishes
was
heard
at
once
upon
disappearance
i
hope
she
goin
to
make
one
o
her
nice
but
i
do
know
she
think
it
quite
worth
while
thought
the
guest
humbly
she
desired
to
go
out
into
the
kitchen
but
it
was
proper
behavior
to
wait
until
she
should
be
called
mercy
crane
was
not
a
person
with
whom
one
could
venture
to
take
liberties
presently
sarah
ellen
began
to
feel
better
she
did
not
often
find
such
a
quiet
place
or
the
quarter
of
an
hour
of
idleness
in
which
to
enjoy
it
and
was
glad
to
make
the
most
of
this
opportunity
just
now
she
felt
tired
and
lonely
she
was
a
busy
unselfish
creature
by
nature
but
now
while
grief
was
sometimes
uppermost
in
her
mind
and
sometimes
a
sense
of
wrong
every
moment
found
her
more
peaceful
and
the
great
excitement
little
by
little
faded
away
what
a
person
poor
sister
barsett
was
to
dread
growing
old
so
she
could
get
about
i
sure
i
shall
miss
her
as
much
as
anybody
said
crane
suddenly
opening
the
kitchen
door
and
letting
in
an
unmistakable
and
delicious
odor
of
that
revived
still
more
the
drooping
spirits
of
her
guest
an
a
good
deal
of
knowledge
has
died
with
her
she
added
coming
into
the
room
and
seeming
to
make
it
lighter
there
she
knew
a
good
deal
but
she
did
know
all
especially
doctorin
insisted
sarah
ellen
from
the
with
an
unexpected
little
laugh
she
used
to
lay
down
the
law
to
me
as
if
i
had
neither
sense
nor
experience
but
when
it
came
to
her
bad
spells
she
always
send
for
me
it
takes
everybody
to
know
everything
but
sister
barsett
was
of
an
opinion
that
her
information
was
sufficient
for
the
town
she
was
tellin
me
the
day
i
went
there
how
she
disliked
to
have
old
mis
doubleday
come
an
visit
with
her
an
remarked
that
she
called
mis
doubleday
very
officious
right
down
on
her
knees
an
prayed
says
she
would
have
thought
i
was
a
heathen
but
i
kind
of
pacified
her
feelin
an
told
her
i
supposed
the
old
lady
meant
well
did
she
give
away
any
of
her
things
mis
barsett
i
mean
inquired
crane
not
in
my
hearin
replied
sarah
ellen
dow
except
one
day
the
first
of
the
week
she
told
her
oldest
sister
mis
deckett
was
that
first
day
she
rode
over
that
she
might
have
her
green
quilted
petticoat
you
see
it
was
a
rainy
day
an
mis
deckett
had
complained
o
feelin
thin
she
went
right
up
an
got
it
and
put
it
on
an
wore
it
off
an
i
sure
i
thought
no
more
about
it
until
i
heard
sister
barsett
groanin
dreadful
in
the
night
i
got
right
up
to
see
what
the
matter
was
an
what
do
you
think
but
she
was
wantin
that
petticoat
back
and
not
thinking
any
too
well
o
nancy
deckett
for
takin
it
when
was
offered
never
showed
no
sense
o
propriety
says
sister
barsett
i
just
wish
you
heard
her
go
on
if
she
had
felt
to
remember
me
continued
sarah
ellen
after
they
had
laughed
a
little
i
full
as
soon
have
some
of
her
nice
she
told
me
once
years
ago
when
i
was
stoppin
to
tea
with
her
an
we
were
havin
it
real
friendly
that
she
should
leave
me
her
britannia
but
i
ai
got
it
in
writin
and
i
ca
say
she
ever
referred
to
the
matter
since
it
ai
as
if
i
had
a
home
o
my
own
to
keep
it
in
but
i
should
have
thought
a
great
deal
of
it
for
her
sake
and
the
speaker
voice
faltered
i
must
say
that
with
all
her
virtues
she
never
was
a
housekeeper
but
i
would
say
it
to
any
but
a
friend
you
never
eat
no
preserves
hers
that
commencin
to
work
an
you
know
as
well
as
i
how
little
forethought
she
had
about
putting
away
her
woolens
i
sat
behind
her
once
in
meetin
when
i
was
stoppin
with
the
tremletts
and
so
occupied
a
seat
in
their
pew
an
i
see
between
ten
an
a
dozen
moth
millers
come
workin
out
o
her
tippet
they
was
flutterin
round
her
bonnet
same
was
a
lamp
i
should
be
mortified
to
death
to
have
such
a
thing
happen
to
me
every
housekeeper
has
her
weak
point
i
got
mine
as
much
as
anybody
else
acknowledged
mercy
crane
with
spirit
but
you
never
see
no
moth
millers
come
workin
out
o
me
in
a
public
place
ai
your
oven
beginning
to
get
overhet
anxiously
inquired
sarah
ellen
dow
who
was
sitting
more
in
the
draught
and
could
not
bear
to
have
any
accident
happen
to
the
supper
crane
flew
to
a
rescue
and
presently
called
her
guest
to
the
table
the
two
women
sat
down
to
deep
and
brimming
cups
of
tea
sarah
ellen
noticed
with
great
gratification
that
her
hostess
had
put
on
two
of
the
best
and
some
preserves
it
was
not
an
supper
she
was
used
to
hard
fare
poor
sarah
ellen
and
this
handsome
social
attention
did
her
good
sister
crane
rarely
entertained
a
friend
and
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
speak
of
the
for
weeks
to
come
you
put
yourself
out
quite
a
for
me
she
acknowledged
how
pretty
these
cups
is
you
ought
to
use
so
common
as
for
me
i
wish
i
had
a
home
i
could
really
call
my
own
to
ask

to
but

sometimes
i
wonder
what
goin
to
become
o
me
when
i
get

i
past
work
takin
care
o
sick
folks
an
bein
in

a
hurry
kind
of
wears
on
me
now
i
most
in

i
was
wishin
the
other
day
that
i
could
get
with
some
comfortable
kind
of
a
sick
person
where
i
could
live
right
along
quiet
as
other
folks
do
but
folks
never
sends
for
me
drove
to
it
i
ai
laid
up
anything
to
really
depend
upon
the
situation
appealed
to
mercy
crane
well
to
do
as
she
was
and
not
burdened
with
responsibilities
she
stirred
uneasily
in
her
chair
but
could
not
bring
herself
to
the
point
of
offering
sarah
ellen
the
home
she
coveted
have
some
hot
tea
she
insisted
in
a
matter
of
fact
tone
and
sarah
ellen
face
which
had
been
lighted
by
a
sudden
eager
hopefulness
grew
dull
and
narrow
again
plenty
plenty
mis
crane
she
said
sadly
is
beautiful
tea
you
always
have
good
tea
but
she
could
not
turn
her
thoughts
from
her
own
uncertain
future
none
of
our
folks
has
ever
lived
to
be
a
burden
she
said
presently
in
a
pathetic
tone
putting
down
her
cup
my
mother
was
thought
to
be
doing
well
until
four
was
dead
at
ten
my
aunt
nancy
came
to
our
house
well
at
twelve
an
died
that
afternoon
my
father
was
sick
but
ten
days
there
was
dear
sister
betsy
she
did
go
in
consumption
but
an
expensive
sickness
i
thought
sometimes
about
you
how
you
get
past
rovin
from
house
to
house
one
o
these
days
i
guess
your
friends
will
stand
by
you
crane
spoke
with
unwonted
sympathy
and
sarah
ellen
heart
leaped
with
joy
you
real
kind
she
said
simply
there
nobody
i
set
so
much
by
but
i
shall
miss
sister
barsett
when
all
said
an
done
she
asked
me
many
a
time
to
stop
with
her
when
i
was
doin
nothin
we
all
have
our
failin
but
she
was
a
friendly
creatur
i
want
to
see
her
laid
away
yes
i
was
thinkin
a
few
minutes
ago
that
i
should
want
to
look
out
an
see
the
funeral
go
by
she
one
o
the
old
neighbors
i
i
shall
have
to
look
or
i
should
feel
right
afterward
said
crane
mournfully
if
i
had
got
so
kind
of
housebound
she
added
with
touching
frankness
i
just
as
soon
go
over
with
you
an
offer
to
watch
this
night
would
astonish
sister
barsett
so
i
do
know
but
she
return
sarah
ellen
eyes
danced
with
amusement
she
could
not
resist
her
own
joke
and
mercy
crane
herself
had
to
smile
now
i
must
be
goin
or
be
dark
said
the
guest
rising
and
sighing
after
she
had
eaten
her
last
crumb
of
gingerbread
yes
thank
ye
you
real
good
i
will
come
back
if
i
find
i
ai
wanted
look
what
a
pretty
sky
there
is
and
the
two
friends
went
to
the
side
door
and
stood
together
in
a
moment
of
affectionate
silence
looking
out
toward
the
sunset
across
the
wide
fields
the
country
was
still
with
that
deep
rural
stillness
which
seems
to
mean
the
absence
of
humanity
only
the
thrushes
were
singing
far
away
in
the
walnut
woods
beyond
the
orchard
and
some
crows
were
flying
over
and
cawed
once
loudly
as
if
they
were
speaking
to
the
women
at
the
door
just
as
the
friends
were
parting
after
most
grateful
acknowledgments
from
sarah
ellen
dow
some
one
came
driving
along
the
road
in
a
hurry
and
stopped
who
that
with
you
mis
crane
called
one
of
their
near
neighbors
it
sarah
ellen
dow
answered
crane
what
the
matter
i
thought
so
but
i
could
rightly
see
come
they
are
in
a
peck
trouble
up
to
sister
barsett
wonderin
where
you
be
grumbled
the
man
they
ca
do
nothin
with
her
she
drove
off
everybody
keeps
for
you
come
step
along
sarah
ellen
do
sister
barsett
exclaimed
both
the
women
mercy
crane
sank
down
upon
the
doorstep
but
sarah
ellen
stepped
out
upon
the
grass
all
of
a
tremble
and
went
toward
the
wagon
they
said
this
afternoon
that
sister
barsett
was
gone
she
managed
to
say
what
did
they
mean
gone
where
asked
the
impatient
neighbor
i
expect
was
one
of
her
spells
she
come
to
they
say
she
wants
somethin
hearty
for
her
tea
nobody
ca
take
one
step
till
you
get
there
neither
sarah
ellen
was
still
dazed
she
returned
to
the
doorway
where
mercy
crane
sat
shaking
with
laughter
i
do
know
but
we
might
as
well
laugh
as
cry
she
said
in
an
aimless
sort
of
way
i
know
you
too
well
to
think
you
going
to
repeat
a
single
word
well
i
get
my
bonnet
an
start
i
expect
i
got
considerable
to
cope
with
but
well
rested
mis
crane
i
certain
did
have
a
beautiful
tea
whatever
the
future
may
have
in
store
she
wore
a
solemn
expression
as
she
mounted
into
the
wagon
in
haste
and
departed
but
she
was
far
out
of
sight
when
mercy
crane
stopped
laughing
and
went
into
the
house
decoration
day
i
a
week
before
the
thirtieth
of
may
three
friends
john
stover
and
henry
merrill
and
asa
brown
happened
to
meet
on
saturday
evening
at
barton
store
at
the
plains
they
were
ready
to
enjoy
this
idle
hour
after
a
busy
week
after
long
easterly
rains
the
sun
had
at
last
come
out
bright
and
clear
and
all
the
barlow
farmers
had
been
planting
there
was
even
a
good
deal
of
ploughing
left
to
be
done
the
season
was
so
backward
the
three
men
were
old
friends
they
had
been
and
when
they
were
hardly
out
of
their
boyhood
the
war
came
on
and
they
enlisted
in
the
same
company
on
the
same
day
and
happened
to
march
away
elbow
to
elbow
then
came
the
great
experience
of
a
great
war
and
the
years
that
followed
their
return
from
the
south
had
come
to
each
almost
alike
these
men
might
have
been
members
of
the
same
rustic
household
they
knew
each
other
history
so
well
they
were
sitting
on
a
low
wooden
bench
at
the
left
of
the
store
door
as
you
went
in
people
were
coming
and
going
on
their
saturday
night
errands
the
was
in
barton
store
but
the
friends
talked
on
eagerly
without
being
interrupted
except
by
an
occasional
nod
of
recognition
they
appeared
to
take
no
notice
at
all
of
the
neighbors
whom
they
saw
oftenest
it
was
a
most
beautiful
evening
the
two
great
elms
were
almost
half
in
leaf
over
the
blacksmith
shop
which
stood
across
the
wide
road
farther
along
were
two
small
houses
and
the
old
white
church
with
its
pretty
belfry
of
four
arched
sides
and
a
tiny
dome
at
the
top
the
large
cockerel
on
the
vane
was
pointing
a
little
south
of
west
and
there
was
still
light
enough
to
make
it
shine
bravely
against
the
deep
blue
eastern
sky
on
the
western
side
of
the
road
near
the
store
were
the
parsonage
and
the
storekeeper
modern
house
which
had
a
french
roof
and
some
attempt
at
decoration
which
the
barlow
people
called
and
regarded
with
mingled
pride
and
disdain
these
buildings
made
the
tiny
village
called
barlow
plains
they
stood
in
the
middle
of
a
long
narrow
strip
of
level
ground
they
were
islanded
by
green
fields
and
pastures
there
were
hills
beyond
the
mountains
themselves
seemed
very
near
scattered
about
on
the
hill
slopes
were
farmhouses
which
stood
so
far
apart
with
their
clusters
of
that
each
looked
lonely
and
the
pine
woods
above
seemed
to
besiege
them
all
it
was
lighter
on
the
uplands
than
it
was
in
the
valley
where
the
three
men
sat
on
their
bench
with
their
backs
to
the
store
and
the
western
sky
well
here
we
be
into
june
an
i
got
a
above
ground
lamented
henry
merrill
your
land
always
late
ai
it
but
you
always
catch
up
with
the
rest
on
us
asa
brown
consoled
him
i
often
observed
that
your
land
though
early
planted
was
late
to
sprout
i
view
it
there
a
good
week
difference
betwixt
me
an
stover
an
your
folks
but
come
first
o
july
we
all
even
up
is
just
so
said
john
stover
taking
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
as
if
he
had
a
good
deal
more
to
say
and
then
replacing
it
as
if
he
had
changed
his
mind
made
it
extry
hard
having
that
long
wet
spell
ca
none
on
us
take
no
day
off
this
season
said
asa
brown
but
nobody
thought
it
worth
his
while
to
respond
to
such
evident
truth
next
saturday
be
the
thirtieth
o
may
that
decoration
day
ai
it
come
round
again
lord
how
the
years
slip
by
after
you
git
to
be
an
along
there
said
asa
again
i
some
our
folks
go
over
to
alton
to
see
the
procession
same
usual
i
got
to
git
one
o
them
small
flags
to
stick
on
our
joel
grave
an
mis
dexter
always
counts
on
havin
some
for
harrison
lot
i
calculate
to
get
somehow
i
must
make
time
to
ride
over
but
i
do
know
where
the
time
comin
from
out
o
next
week
i
wish
the
women
folks
would
tend
to
them
things
there
the
spot
where
eb
munson
an
john
tighe
lays
in
the
lot
an
i
did
mean
certain
to
buy
flags
for
last
year
an
year
before
but
i
went
forgot
it
i
like
to
have
folks
that
rode
by
notice
for
once
if
they
was
town
paupers
eb
munson
was
as
darin
a
man
as
ever
stepped
out
to
tuck
o
drum
so
he
was
said
john
stover
taking
his
pipe
with
decision
and
knocking
out
the
ashes
drink
was
his
ruin
but
i
wa
one
that
could
be
harsh
with
eb
no
matter
what
he
done
he
worked
hard
he
could
too
but
he
wa
like
a
sound
man
an
i
think
he
took
somethin
first
not
so
much
he
loved
it
but
to
kind
of
keep
his
strength
up
so
he
could
work
an
then
all
of
a
sudden
rum
clinched
with
him
an
threw
him
eb
was
talkin
o
me
one
day
when
he
was
about
half
full
an
says
he
right
out
would
have
fell
to
this
state
says
he
i
had
me
a
home
an
a
little
but
it
do
make
no
difference
to
nobody
and
it
the
best
comfort
i
seem
to
have
an
i
ai
goin
to
do
without
it
i
all
the
time
says
he
if
i
keep
middlin
full
i
make
out
to
hold
my
own
an
to
keep
along
o
my
work
i
pitied
eb
i
says
to
him
ai
goin
to
bring
no
disgrace
on
us
old
army
boys
be
you
eb
an
he
says
no
he
wa
i
think
if
he
lived
to
get
one
them
big
fat
pensions
he
had
it
easier
eight
dollars
a
month
paid
his
board
while
he
pick
up
what
cheap
work
he
could
an
then
he
got
so
that
decent
folks
did
seem
to
want
the
bother
of
him
an
so
he
come
on
the
town
there
was
somethin
else
to
it
said
henry
merrill
soberly
drink
come
natural
to
him
was
born
in
him
i
expect
an
there
nobody
that
could
turn
the
divil
out
same
they
did
in
scriptur
his
father
an
his
was
drinkin
men
but
they
was
an
good
neighbors
an
never
set
out
to
wrong
nobody
was
the
custom
to
drink
in
their
day
folks
was
colder
an
lived
poorer
in
early
times
an
that
how
most
of
kept
but
what
stove
eb
all
up
was
his
with
marthy
peck
her
forsakin
of
him
an
marryin
old
john
down
whilst
eb
was
off
to
war
i
always
laid
it
up
her
so
i
said
asa
brown
she
did
use
the
poor
fellow
right
i
guess
she
was
full
as
well
off
but
it
one
thing
to
show
judgment
an
another
thing
to
have
heart
there
was
a
long
pause
the
subject
was
too
familiar
to
need
further
comment
there
ai
no
public
sperit
here
in
barlow
announced
asa
brown
with
decision
i
do
we
could
ever
get
up
anything
for
decoration
day
i
felt
kind
of
but
it
always
comes
in
a
busy
time
no
time
to
have
it
anyway
right
in
late
plantin
no
use
to
look
for
public
sperit
you
got
some
yourself
observed
john
stover
soberly
but
something
had
pleased
him
in
the
discouraged
suggestion
perhaps
we
could
mark
the
day
this
year
it
comes
on
a
saturday
that
ai
nigh
so
bad
as
bein
in
the
middle
of
the
week
nobody
made
any
answer
and
presently
he
went
on
there
was
a
time
along
back
when
folks
was
too
nigh
the
to
give
much
thought
to
the
bigness
of
it
the
best
fellows
was
them
that
had
stayed
to
home
an
worked
their
trades
an
laid
up
money
but
i
do
know
it
so
now
yes
the
fellows
that
stayed
at
home
got
all
the
fat
places
an
when
we
come
back
we
felt
dreadful
behind
the
times
grumbled
asa
brown
i
remember
how
was
they
begun
to
call
us
heroes
an
old
just
about
the
same
time
resumed
stover
with
a
chuckle
we
no
hand
for
strippin
woodland
nor
even
tradin
hosses
them
first
few
years
i
don
know
why
was
we
were
so
beat
out
the
best
most
on
us
could
do
was
to
sag
right
on
to
the
old
folks
father
he
never
wanted
me
to
go
to
the
war
was
partly
his
quaker
breed
an
he
used
to
be
dreadful
mortified
with
the
way
i
hung
round
down
here
to
the
store
an
loafed
round
about
when
i
was
out
south
an
with
folks
that
did
know
nothin
about
what
the
generals
done
there
i
see
me
now
just
as
he
see
me
then
but
after
i
had
my
out
i
took
holt
o
the
old
farm
o
father
an
made
it
bounce
look
at
them
old
meadows
an
see
the
herd
grass
that
come
off
of
last
year
i
ai
ashamed
o
my
place
now
if
i
did
go
to
the
war
it
all
looks
a
sight
bigger
to
me
now
than
it
did
then
said
henry
merrill
our
goin
to
the
war
i
refer
to
we
did
sense
it
no
more
than
other
folks
did
i
used
to
be
sick
o
hearin
their
stuff
about
patriotism
and
lovin
your
country
an
them
pieces
o
poetry
women
folks
wrote
for
the
papers
on
the
old
flag
an
our
fallen
heroes
them
things
they
did
seem
to
strike
me
in
the
right
place
but
i
tell
ye
it
kind
o
starts
me
now
every
time
i
come
on
the
flag
sudden
it
does
so
a
spell
ago
in
the
fall
i
guess
it
was
i
was
over
to
alton
an
there
was
a
fire
company
paradin
they
got
the
prize
at
a
fair
an
had
just
come
home
on
the
cars
an
i
heard
the
band
so
i
stepped
to
the
front
o
the
store
where
me
an
my
woman
was
tradin
an
the
company
felt
well
an
was
comin
along
the
street
as
good
as
troops
i
see
the
old
flag
kind
of
blowin
back
an
it
went
all
over
me
somethin
worked
round
in
my
throat
i
vow
i
come
near
cryin
i
was
glad
nobody
see
me
i
go
to
war
again
in
a
minute
declared
stover
after
an
expressive
pause
but
i
expect
we
should
know
better
what
we
was
about
i
don
know
but
we
got
too
many
rooted
opinions
now
to
make
us
the
best
o
soldiers
martin
tighe
an
john
tighe
was
considerable
older
than
the
rest
and
they
done
well
answered
henry
merrill
quickly
we
three
was
the
youngest
of
any
but
we
did
think
at
the
time
we
knew
the
most
well

old
at

here
up
to
the
an
round
by
deacon
elwell
lane
so
to
notice
them
two
stones
he
set
up
for
his
boys
that
was
sunk
on
the
i
expect
they
notice
stones
same
if
the
folks
laid
there
do
they
he
spoke
wistfully
the
others
knew
that
stover
was
thinking
of
the
stone
he
had
set
up
to
the
memory
of
his
only
brother
whose
nameless
grave
had
been
made
somewhere
in
the
wilderness
i
do
know
but
what
they
be
mad
if
we
do
go
by
every
house
in
town
he
added
anxiously
as
they
rose
to
go
home
is
a
terrible
scattered
population
in
barlow
to
favor
with
a
procession
it
was
a
mild
starlit
night
the
three
friends
took
their
separate
ways
presently
leaving
the
plains
road
and
crossing
the
fields
by
toward
their
farms
ii
the
week
went
by
and
the
next
saturday
morning
brought
fair
weather
it
was
a
busy
morning
on
the
farms
like
any
other
but
long
before
noon
the
teams
of
horses
and
oxen
were
seen
going
home
from
work
in
the
fields
and
everybody
got
ready
in
haste
for
the
great
event
of
the
afternoon
it
was
so
seldom
that
any
occasion
roused
public
interest
in
barlow
that
there
was
an
unexpected
response
and
the
green
before
the
old
white
was
covered
with
country
wagons
and
groups
of
people
whole
families
together
who
had
come
on
foot
the
old
soldiers
were
to
meet
in
the
church
at
half
past
one
the
procession
was
to
start
and
on
its
return
the
minister
was
to
make
an
address
in
the
old
john
stover
had
been
first
lieutenant
in
the
war
so
he
was
made
captain
of
the
day
a
man
from
the
next
town
had
offered
to
drum
for
them
and
martin
tighe
proud
boy
was
present
with
his
fife
he
had
a
great
longing
strange
enough
in
that
peaceful
neighborhood
to
go
into
the
army
but
he
and
his
elder
brother
were
the
mainstay
of
their
crippled
father
and
he
could
not
be
spared
from
the
large
household
until
a
younger
brother
could
take
his
place
so
that
all
his
fire
and
military
zeal
went
for
the
present
into
martial
tunes
and
the
fife
was
a
for
his
enthusiasm
the
army
men
were
used
to
seeing
each
other
everybody
knew
everybody
in
the
little
country
town
of
barlow
but
when
one
comrade
after
another
appeared
in
what
remained
of
his
accoutrements
they
felt
the
day
to
be
greater
than
they
had
planned
and
the
simple
ceremony
proved
more
solemn
than
any
one
expected
they
could
make
no
use
of
their
jokes
and
friendly
greetings
their
old
blue
coats
and
tarnished
army
caps
looked
faded
and
antiquated
enough
one
of
the
men
had
nothing
left
but
his
rusty
canteen
and
rifle
but
these
he
carried
like
sacred
emblems
he
had
worn
out
all
his
army
clothes
long
ago
because
he
was
too
poor
when
he
was
discharged
to
buy
any
others
when
the
door
of
the
church
opened
the
veterans
were
not
abashed
by
the
size
and
silence
of
the
crowd
they
came
walking
two
by
two
down
the
steps
and
took
their
places
in
line
as
if
there
were
nobody
looking
on
their
brief
evolutions
were
like
a
mystic
rite
the
two
lame
men
refused
to
do
anything
but
march
as
best
they
could
but
poor
martin
tighe
more
disabled
than
they
was
brought
out
and
lifted
into
henry
merrill
best
wagon
where
he
sat
up
straight
and
soldierly
with
his
boy
for
driver
there
was
a
little
flag
in
the
before
him
which
flapped
gayly
in
the
breeze
it
was
such
a
long
time
since
he
had
been
seen
that
everybody
found
him
a
great
object
of
interest
and
paid
him
much
attention
even
those
who
were
tired
of
being
asked
to
contribute
to
his
support
who
resented
the
fact
of
his
having
a
helpless
wife
and
great
family
who
always
insisted
that
with
his
little
pension
and
hopeless
lameness
his
fingerless
left
hand
and
failing
sight
he
could
support
himself
and
his
household
if
he
chose
even
those
persons
came
forward
now
to
greet
him
handsomely
and
with
large
approval
to
be
sure
he
enjoyed
the
conversation
of
idlers
and
his
wife
had
a
complaining
way
that
was
the
same
as
begging
especially
since
her
boys
began
to
grow
up
and
be
of
some
use
and
there
were
one
or
two
near
neighbors
who
never
let
them
really
want
so
other
people
who
had
cares
enough
of
their
own
could
excuse
themselves
for
forgetting
him
the
year
round
and
even
call
him
shiftless
but
there
were
none
to
look
askance
at
martin
tighe
on
decoration
day
as
he
sat
in
the
wagon
with
his
bleached
face
like
a
captive
and
his
thin
afflicted
body
he
stretched
out
his
whole
hand
impartially
to
those
who
had
remembered
and
those
who
had
forgotten
both
his
courage
at
fredericksburg
and
his
sorry
need
in
barlow
henry
merrill
had
secured
the
engine
company
large
flag
in
alton
and
now
carried
it
proudly
there
were
eight
men
in
line
two
by
two
and
marching
a
good
bit
apart
to
make
their
line
the
longer
the
fife
and
drum
struck
up
gallantly
together
and
the
little
procession
moved
away
slowly
along
the
country
road
it
gave
an
unwonted
touch
of
color
to
the
landscape
the
scarlet
the
blue
between
the
fields
and
budding
roadside
thickets
between
the
wide
dim
ranges
of
the
mountains
under
the
great
white
clouds
of
the
spring
sky
such
processions
grow
more
pathetic
year
by
year
it
will
not
be
so
long
now
before
wondering
children
will
have
seen
the
last
the
aging
faces
of
the
men
the
renewed
comradeship
the
quick
beat
of
the
hearts
that
remember
the
tenderness
of
those
who
think
upon
old
sorrows
all
these
make
the
day
a
lovelier
and
a
sadder
festival
so
men
hearts
were
stirred
they
knew
not
why
when
they
heard
the
shrill
fife
and
the
incessant
drum
along
the
quiet
barlow
road
and
saw
the
handful
of
old
soldiers
marching
by
nobody
thought
of
them
as
familiar
men
and
neighbors
alone
they
were
a
part
of
that
army
which
had
saved
its
country
they
had
taken
their
lives
in
their
hands
and
gone
out
to
fight
for
their
country
plain
john
stover
and
jesse
dean
and
the
rest
no
matter
if
every
other
day
in
the
year
they
counted
for
little
or
much
whether
they
were
and
lagging
whether
their
farms
were
of
poor
soil
or
rich
the
little
troop
went
in
slender
line
along
the
road
the
crowded
country
wagons
and
all
the
people
who
went
afoot
followed
martin
tighe
wagon
as
if
it
were
a
great
gathering
at
a
country
funeral
the
route
was
short
and
the
long
straggling
line
marched
slowly
it
could
go
no
faster
than
the
lame
men
could
walk
in
one
of
the
houses
by
the
roadside
an
old
woman
sat
by
a
window
in
an
black
gown
and
clean
white
cap
with
a
prim
border
which
bound
her
thin
sharp
features
closely
she
had
been
for
a
long
time
looking
out
eagerly
over
the
snowberry
and
bushes
her
face
was
pressed
close
to
the
pane
and
presently
she
caught
sight
of
the
great
flag
as
it
came
down
the
road
let
me
see
i
got
to
see
go
by
she
pleaded
trying
to
rise
from
her
chair
alone
when
she
heard
the
fife
and
the
women
helped
her
to
the
door
and
held
her
so
that
she
could
stand
and
wait
she
had
been
an
old
woman
when
the
war
began
she
had
sent
sons
and
grandsons
to
the
field
they
were
all
gone
now
as
the
men
came
by
she
straightened
her
bent
figure
with
all
the
vigor
of
youth
the
fife
and
drum
stopped
suddenly
the
colors
lowered
she
did
not
heed
that
but
her
old
eyes
flashed
and
then
filled
with
tears
to
see
the
flag
going
to
salute
the
soldiers
graves
thank
ye
boys
thank
ye
she
cried
in
her
quavering
voice
and
they
all
cheered
her
the
cheer
went
back
along
the
straggling
line
for
old
grandmother
dexter
standing
there
in
her
front
door
between
the
lilacs
it
was
one
of
the
great
moments
of
the
day
the
few
old
people
at
the
too
were
waiting
to
see
the
show
the
keeper
young
son
knowing
that
it
was
a
day
of
festivity
and
not
understanding
exactly
why
had
put
his
toy
flag
out
of
the
gable
window
and
there
it
showed
against
the
gray
clapboards
like
a
gay
flower
it
was
the
only
bit
of
decoration
along
the
veterans
way
and
they
stopped
and
saluted
it
before
they
broke
ranks
and
went
out
to
the
field
corner
beyond
the
barn
to
the
bit
of
ground
that
held
the
paupers
unmarked
graves
there
was
a
solemn
silence
while
asa
brown
went
to
the
back
of
tighe
wagon
where
such
light
freight
was
carried
and
brought
two
flags
and
he
and
john
stover
planted
them
straight
in
the
green
sod
they
knew
well
enough
where
the
right
graves
were
for
these
had
been
made
in
a
corner
by
themselves
with
unwonted
sentiment
and
so
eben
munson
and
john
tighe
were
honored
like
the
rest
both
by
their
flags
and
by
great
and
unexpected
nosegays
of
spring
flowers
daffies
and
flowering
currant
and
red
tulips
which
lay
on
the
graves
already
john
stover
and
his
comrade
glanced
at
each
other
curiously
while
they
stood
singing
and
then
laid
their
own
bunches
of
lilacs
down
and
came
away
then
something
happened
that
almost
none
of
the
people
in
the
wagons
understood
martin
tighe
boy
who
played
the
fife
had
studied
well
his
part
and
on
his
poor
instrument
now
sounded
taps
as
well
as
he
could
he
had
heard
it
done
once
in
alton
at
a
funeral
the
plaintive
notes
called
sadly
over
the
fields
and
echoed
back
from
the
hills
the
few
veterans
could
not
look
at
each
other
their
eyes
brimmed
up
with
tears
they
could
not
have
spoken
nothing
called
back
old
army
days
like
that
they
had
a
sudden
vision
of
the
virginian
camp
the
hillside
dotted
white
with
tents
the
twinkling
lights
in
other
camps
and
far
away
the
glow
of
smouldering
fires
they
heard
the
bugle
call
from
post
to
post
they
remembered
the
chilly
winter
night
the
wind
in
the
pines
the
laughter
of
the
men
lights
out
martin
tighe
boy
sounded
it
again
sharply
it
seemed
as
if
poor
eb
munson
and
john
tighe
must
hear
it
too
in
their
narrow
graves
the
procession
went
on
and
stopped
here
and
there
at
the
little
graveyards
on
the
farms
leaving
their
bright
flags
to
flutter
through
summer
and
winter
rains
and
snows
and
to
bleach
in
the
wind
and
sunshine
when
they
returned
to
the
church
the
minister
made
an
address
about
the
war
and
every
one
listened
with
new
ears
most
of
what
he
said
was
familiar
enough
to
his
listeners
they
were
used
to
reading
those
phrases
about
the
results
of
the
war
the
glorious
future
of
the
south
in
their
weekly
newspapers
but
there
never
had
been
such
a
spirit
of
patriotism
and
loyalty
waked
in
barlow
as
was
waked
that
day
by
the
poor
parade
of
the
remnant
of
the
barlow
soldiers
they
sent
flags
to
all
the
distant
graves
and
proud
were
those
households
who
claimed
kinship
with
valor
and
could
drive
or
walk
away
with
their
flags
held
up
so
that
others
could
see
that
they
too
were
of
the
elect
iii
it
is
well
that
the
days
are
long
in
the
last
of
may
but
john
stover
had
to
hurry
more
than
usual
with
his
evening
work
and
then
having
the
longest
distance
to
walk
he
was
much
the
latest
comer
to
the
plains
store
where
his
two
triumphant
friends
were
waiting
for
him
impatiently
on
the
bench
they
also
had
made
excuse
of
going
to
the
and
doing
an
unnecessary
errand
for
their
wives
and
were
talking
together
so
busily
that
they
had
gathered
a
group
about
them
before
the
store
when
they
saw
stover
coming
they
rose
hastily
and
crossed
the
road
to
meet
him
as
if
they
were
a
committee
in
special
session
they
leaned
against
the
fence
after
they
had
shaken
hands
with
each
other
solemnly
well
we
had
a
great
day
ai
we
john
asked
henry
merrill

grand

no
idea

such
a
show

three
over

most
o
the
alton
men

the
rigiments

other
side
o
the
state
line
an
they
was
in
other
battles
an
never
camped
nowheres

to
me

ought
to
have
home
feelin
enough
to
do
what
we
can
right
here
the
minister
says
to
me
this
afternoon
that
he
was
goin
to
arrange
an
have
some
talks

the
next
winter

some
of
us

where
we
was
in
the
south
an
one
night
be
about
camp
life
an
one
about
the
long
marches

then
about
the
battles
that
would
take
some
time
an
tell
all
we
could
about
the
boys
that
was
killed
an
their
record
so
they
would
be
forgot
he
said
some
of
the
folks
must
have
the
letters
we
wrote
home
from
the
front
an
we
could
make
out
quite
a
history
of
us
i
call
elder
dallas
a
very
smart
man
he
planned
it
all
out
for
the
benefit
o
the
young
folks
he
said
announced
henry
merrill
in
a
tone
of
approval
i
there
ai
none
of
us
but
could
add
a
little
somethin
answered
john
stover
modestly
learn
the
young
folks
a
good
deal
i
should
be
scared
numb
to
try
an
speak
from
the
pulpit
that
ai
what
the
elder
means
is
it
now
i
was
one
that
had
a
good
chance
to
see
somethin
o
i
shook
hands
with
president
lincoln
an
i
always
think
i
worth
lookin
at
for
that
if
i
for
nothin
else
was
that
time
i
was
just
out
o
an
able
to
crawl
about
some
i
often
told
you
how
was
i
met
him
an
he
stopped
an
shook
hands
an
asked
where
i
been
at
the
front
an
how
i
was
gettin
along
with
my
hurts
well
we
see
how
is
when
winter
comes
i
never
thought
i
had
no
gift
for
public
speakin
for
drivin
cattle
or
pollin
the
house
days
here
i
got
somethin
in
mind
you
need
speak
about
it
if
i
tell
it
to
ye
he
added
suddenly
you
know
all
them
flowers
that
was
laid
on
to
eb
munson
grave
an
tighe
i
mistrusted
you
thought
the
same
thing
i
did
by
the
way
you
looked
they
come
from
marthy
front
yard
my
woman
told
me
when
we
got
home
that
she
knew
in
a
minute
there
nobody
in
town
had
that
kind
o
red
flowers
but
her
she
must
ha
kind
o
harked
back
to
the
days
when
she
was
marthy
peck
she
must
have
come
over
with
after
dark
or
else
dreadful
early
in
the
mornin
henry
merrill
cleared
his
throat
there
ai
nothin
mis
down
he
said
i
would
ha
spoken
this
you
had
led
right
on
to
it
but
i
overtook
her
when
i
was
gittin
towards
home
this
afternoon
an
i
see
by
her
looks
she
was
worked
up
a
good
deal
but
we
talked
about
how
well
things
had
gone
off
an
she
wanted
to
know
what
expenses
we
been
put
to
an
i
told
her
and
she
said
she
give
five
dollars
any
day
i
stop
in
for
it
an
then
she
spoke
right
out
alone
in
the
world
says
she
i
got
to
do
with
an
i
like
to
have
a
plain
stone
put
up
to
eb
grave
with
the
number
of
his
rigiment
on
it
an
i
pay
the
bill
out
o
down
money
she
says
mine
an
i
want
you
to
see
to
it
i
said
i
would
but
we
made
a
plot
to
git
some
them
soldiers
headstones
that
provided
by
the
government
was
a
shame
it
had
been
overlooked
so
long
says
she
goin
to
pay
for
eb
myself
an
i
told
her
there
would
be
no
objection
do
ary
one
o
you
speak
about
it
be
fair
she
was
real
i
never
felt
to
respect
marthy
so
before
we
was
kind
o
hard
on
her
sometimes
but
folks
could
help
it
i
seen
her
pass
eb
right
by
in
the
road
an
never
look
at
him
when
he
first
come
home
said
john
stover
if
she
had
felt
bad
she
would
have
cared
one
way
or
insisted
henry
merrill
for
us
to
judge
sometimes
folks
has
to
get
along
in
years
before
they
see
things
fair
come
i
must
be
goin
home
i
tired
as
an
old
dog
it
seemed
kind
o
natural
to
be
steppin
out
together
again
strange
we
three
got
through
with
so
little
damage
an
so
many
dropped
round
us
said
asa
brown
i
never
been
one
mite
sorry
i
went
out
in
old
a
company
i
was
thinkin
when
i
was
marchin
though
that
we
should
all
have
to
take
to
the
wagons
before
long
an
do
our
on
wheels
so
many
of
us
felt
kind
o
stiff
there
one
thing
folks
wo
never
say
again
that
we
ca
show
no
public
sperit
here
in
old
barlow
the
flight
of
betsey
lane
i
one
windy
morning
in
may
three
old
women
sat
together
near
an
open
window
in
the
shed
chamber
of
byfleet
the
wind
was
from
the
northwest
but
their
window
faced
the
southeast
and
they
were
only
visited
by
an
occasional
pleasant
waft
of
fresh
air
they
were
close
together
knee
to
knee
picking
over
a
bushel
of
beans
and
commanding
a
view
of
the
green
yard
below
and
of
the
winding
sandy
road
that
led
to
the
village
two
miles
away
some
captive
bees
were
scolding
among
the
cobwebs
of
the
rafters
overhead
or
thumping
against
the
upper
panes
of
glass
two
calves
were
bawling
from
the
barnyard
where
some
of
the
men
were
at
work
loading
a
and
shouting
as
if
every
one
were
deaf
there
was
a
cheerful
feeling
of
activity
and
even
an
air
of
comfort
about
the
byfleet
almost
every
one
was
possessed
of
a
most
interesting
past
though
there
was
less
to
be
said
about
the
future
the
inmates
were
by
no
means
distressed
or
unhappy
many
of
them
retired
to
this
shelter
only
for
the
winter
season
and
would
go
out
presently
some
to
begin
such
work
as
they
could
still
do
others
to
live
in
their
own
small
houses
old
age
had
impoverished
most
of
them
by
limiting
their
power
of
endurance
but
far
from
lamenting
the
fact
that
they
were
town
charges
they
rather
liked
the
change
and
excitement
of
a
winter
residence
on
the
there
was
a
young
widow
with
seven
children
who
was
an
exception
to
the
general
level
of
society
because
she
deplored
the
change
in
her
fortunes
the
older
women
regarded
her
with
suspicion
and
were
apt
to
talk
about
her
in
moments
like
this
when
they
happened
to
sit
together
at
their
work
the
three
were
dressed
alike
in
stout
brown
ginghams
checked
by
a
white
line
and
all
wore
great
faded
aprons
of
blue
drilling
with
sufficient
pockets
convenient
to
the
right
hand
miss
peggy
bond
was
a
very
small
person
who
wore
a
huge
pair
of
spectacles
holding
her
sharp
chin
well
up
in
air
as
if
to
supplement
an
inadequate
nose
she
was
more
than
half
blind
but
the
spectacles
seemed
to
face
upward
instead
of
square
ahead
as
if
their
wearer
were
always
on
the
sharp
lookout
for
birds
miss
bond
had
suffered
much
personal
damage
from
time
to
time
because
she
never
took
heed
where
she
planted
her
feet
and
so
was
always
tripping
and
stubbing
her
bruised
way
through
the
world
she
had
fallen
down
hatchways
and
cellarways
and
stepped
composedly
into
deep
ditches
and
pasture
brooks
but
she
was
proud
of
stating
that
she
was
upsighted
and
so
was
her
father
before
her
at
the
where
an
unusual
malady
was
considered
a
distinction
upsightedness
was
looked
upon
as
a
most
honorable
infirmity
plain
rheumatism
such
as
afflicted
aunt
lavina
dow
whose
twisted
hands
found
even
this
light
work
difficult
and
tiresome
plain
rheumatism
was
something
of
occurrence
and
nobody
cared
to
hear
about
it
poor
peggy
was
a
meek
and
friendly
soul
who
never
put
herself
forward
she
was
just
like
other
folks
as
she
always
loved
to
say
but
lavina
dow
was
a
different
sort
of
person
altogether
of
great
dignity
and
occasionally
almost
aggressive
behavior
the
time
had
been
when
she
could
do
a
good
day
work
with
anybody
but
for
many
years
now
she
had
not
left
the
being
too
badly
crippled
to
work
she
had
no
relations
or
friends
to
visit
but
from
an
innate
love
of
authority
she
could
not
submit
to
being
one
of
those
who
are
forgotten
by
the
world
dow
was
the
hostess
and
social
lawgiver
here
where
she
remembered
every
inmate
and
every
item
of
interest
for
nearly
forty
years
besides
an
immense
amount
of
town
history
and
biography
for
three
or
four
generations
back
she
was
the
dear
friend
of
the
third
woman
betsey
lane
together
they
led
thought
and
opinion
chiefly
opinion
and
held
sway
not
only
over
byfleet
but
also
the
selectmen
and
all
others
in
authority
betsey
lane
had
spent
most
of
her
life
as
to
the
respected
household
of
old
general
thornton
she
had
been
much
trusted
and
valued
and
at
the
breaking
up
of
that
once
large
and
flourishing
family
she
had
been
left
in
good
circumstances
what
with
legacies
and
her
own
comfortable
savings
but
by
sad
misfortune
and
lavish
generosity
everything
had
been
scattered
and
after
much
illness
which
ended
in
a
stiffened
arm
and
more
uncertainty
the
good
soul
had
sensibly
decided
that
it
was
easier
for
the
whole
town
to
support
her
than
for
a
part
of
it
she
had
always
hoped
to
see
something
of
the
world
before
she
died
she
came
of
an
adventurous
seafaring
stock
but
had
never
made
a
longer
journey
than
to
the
towns
of
danby
and
northville
thirty
miles
away
they
were
all
old
women
but
betsey
lane
who
was
and
looked
much
older
was
the
youngest
peggy
bond
was
far
on
in
the
seventies
and
dow
was
at
least
ten
years
older
she
made
a
great
secret
of
her
years
and
as
she
sometimes
spoke
of
events
prior
to
the
revolution
with
the
assertion
of
having
been
an
she
naturally
wore
an
air
of
vast
antiquity
her
tales
were
an
inexpressible
delight
to
betsey
lane
who
felt
younger
by
twenty
years
because
her
friend
and
comrade
was
so
unconscious
of
chronological
limitations
the
bushel
basket
of
cranberry
beans
was
within
easy
reach
and
each
of
the
pickers
had
filled
her
lap
from
it
again
and
again
the
shed
chamber
was
not
an
unpleasant
place
in
which
to
sit
at
work
with
its
traces
of
seed
corn
hanging
from
the
brown
its
spare
churns
and
dusty
loom
and
rickety
and
a
few
bits
of
old
furniture
in
one
far
corner
was
a
wide
board
of
dismal
use
and
suggestion
and
close
beside
it
an
old
cradle
there
was
a
battered
chest
of
drawers
where
the
keeper
of
the
kept
his
with
the
withered
remains
of
three
seed
cucumbers
ornamenting
the
top
nothing
beautiful
could
be
discovered
nothing
interesting
but
there
was
something
usable
and
homely
about
the
place
it
was
the
favorite
and
untroubled
bower
of
the
to
which
they
might
retreat
unmolested
from
the
public
apartments
of
this
rustic
institution
betsey
lane
blew
away
the
chaff
from
her
handful
of
beans
the
spring
breeze
blew
the
chaff
back
again
and
sifted
it
over
her
face
and
shoulders
she
rubbed
it
out
of
her
eyes
impatiently
and
happened
to
notice
old
peggy
holding
her
own
handful
high
as
if
it
were
an
oblation
and
turning
her
queer
head
this
way
and
that
to
look
at
the
beans
sharply
as
if
she
were
first
cousin
to
a
hen
there
miss
bond
is
kind
of
botherin
work
for
you
ai
it
betsey
inquired
compassionately
i
feel
to
enjoy
it
anything
that
i
can
do
my
own
way
so
responded
peggy
i
like
to
do
my
part
ai
that
old
mis
fales
comin
up
the
road
it
sounds
like
her
step
the
others
looked
but
they
were
not
and
for
a
moment
peggy
had
the
advantage
fales
was
not
a
favorite
i
hope
she
ai
comin
here
to
put
up
this
spring
i
guess
she
now
it
gettin
so
late
said
betsey
lane
she
likes
to
go
soon
as
the
roads
is
settled
is
mis
fales
said
peggy
bond
listening
with
solemn
anxiety
there
do
let
pray
her
by
i
guess
she
headin
for
her
cousin
folks
up
beech
hill
way
said
betsey
presently
if
she
left
her
daughter
this
mornin
have
got
just
about
as
far
as
this
i
kind
o
wish
she
had
stepped
in
just
to
pass
the
time
o
day
long
she
going
to
make
no
stop
there
was
a
silence
as
to
further
speech
in
the
shed
chamber
and
even
the
calves
were
quiet
in
the
barnyard
the
men
had
all
gone
away
to
the
field
where
was
going
on
the
beans
clicked
steadily
into
the
wooden
measure
at
the
pickers
feet
betsey
lane
began
to
sing
a
hymn
and
the
others
joined
in
as
best
they
might
like
autumnal
crickets
their
voices
were
sharp
and
cracked
with
now
and
then
a
few
low
notes
of
plaintive
tone
betsey
herself
could
sing
pretty
well
but
the
others
could
only
make
a
kind
of
accompaniment
their
voices
ceased
altogether
at
the
higher
notes
oh
my
i
wish
i
had
the
means
to
go
to
the
centennial
mourned
betsey
lane
stopping
so
suddenly
that
the
others
had
to
go
on
croaking
and
shrilling
without
her
for
a
moment
before
they
could
stop
it
seems
to
me
as
if
i
ca
die
happy
i
do
she
added
i
ai
never
seen
nothin
of
the
world
an

what

as
old
as
i
be

despair

new
cow
out
of
a
drove
a
dreadful
unruly
beast
dow
stopped
for
breath
and
reached
down
for
a
new
supply
of
beans
her
empty
apron
was
gray
with
soft
chaff
betsey
lane
still
pondering
on
the
centennial
began
to
sing
another
verse
of
her
hymn
and
again
the
old
women
joined
her
at
this
moment
some
strangers
came
driving
round
into
the
yard
from
the
front
of
the
house
the
turf
was
soft
and
our
friends
did
not
hear
the
horses
steps
their
voices
cracked
and
quavered
it
was
a
funny
little
concert
and
a
lady
in
an
open
carriage
just
below
listened
with
sympathy
and
amusement
ii
betsey
betsey
miss
lane
a
voice
called
eagerly
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
that
led
up
from
the
shed
betsey
there
a
lady
here
wants
to
see
you
right
away
betsey
was
dazed
with
excitement
like
a
country
child
who
knows
the
rare
pleasure
of
being
called
out
of
school
lor
i
ai
fit
to
go
down
be
i
she
faltered
looking
anxiously
at
her
friends
but
peggy
was
gazing
even
nearer
to
the
zenith
than
usual
in
her
excited
effort
to
see
down
into
the
yard
and
dow
only
nodded
somewhat
jealously
and
said
that
she
guessed
was
nobody
would
do
her
any
harm
she
rose
ponderously
while
betsey
hesitated
being
as
they
would
have
said
all
of
a
twitter
it
is
a
lady
certain
dow
assured
her
often
there
a
lady
comes
here
while
there
was
any
of
mis
thornton
folks
left
i
without
visits
from
the
gentry
said
betsey
lane
turning
back
proudly
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
with
a
touch
of
pride
and
sense
of
high
station
then
she
disappeared
and
closed
the
door
behind
her
at
the
with
a
decision
quite
unwelcome
to
the
friends
above
she
need
been
so
dreadful
anybody
was
goin
to
listen
i
guess
we
got
folks
to
ride
an
see
us
or
had
once
if
we
now
said
miss
peggy
bond
plaintively
i
expect
was
only
the
wind
shoved
it
to
said
aunt
lavina
betsey
is
one
that
gits
flustered
easier
than
some
i
wish
was
somebody
to
take
her
off
an
give
her
a
kind
of
a
good
time
young
to
settle
down
of
old
folks
like
us
betsey
got
a
notion
o
rovin
such
as
ai
my
natur
but
i
should
like
to
see
her
satisfied
she
been
a
very
understandin
person
if
she
had
the
advantages
that
some
does
is
so
said
peggy
bond
tilting
her
chin
high
i
suppose
you
ca
hear
nothin
they
saying
i
feel
my
hearin
ai
up
to
whar
it
was
i
can
hear
things
close
to
me
well
as
ever
but
there
ai
everything
as
if
we
lived
where
there
was
more
goin
on
to
hear
seems
to
me
them
folks
is
stoppin
a
good
while
they
surely
be
agreed
lavina
dow
i
expect
it
somethin
particular
there
ai
none
of
the
thornton
folks
left
except
one
o
the
an
i
often
heard
betsey
remark
that
she
should
never
see
her
more
for
she
lives
to
london
strange
how
folks
feels
contented
in
them
strayaway
places
off
to
the
ends
of
the
airth
the
flies
and
bees
were
buzzing
against
the
hot
windowpanes
the
handfuls
of
beans
were
clicking
into
the
brown
wooden
measure
a
bird
came
and
perched
on
the
windowsill
and
then
flitted
away
toward
the
blue
sky
below
in
the
yard
betsey
lane
stood
talking
with
the
lady
she
had
put
her
blue
drilling
apron
over
her
head
and
her
face
was
shining
with
delight
lor
dear
she
said
for
at
least
the
third
time
i

when
i
first

awful
pritty
baby

the
charming
young
guest
i
going
to
carry
over
some
of
the
pictures
and
furniture
from
the
old
house
i
did
care
half
so
much
for
them
when
i
was
younger
as
i
do
now
perhaps
next
summer
we
shall
all
come
over

a
while
i
should
like
to
see
my
girls
and
boys
playing
under
the
pines
i
wish
you
was
livin
to
the
old
place
said
betsey
lane
her
imagination
was
not
swift
she
needed
time
to
think
over
all
that
was
being
told
her
and
she
could
not
fancy
the
two
strange
houses
across
the
sea
the
old
thornton
house
was
to
her
mind
the
most
delightful
and
elegant
in
the
world
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
asked
strafford
kindly
anything
that
i
can
do
for
you
myself
before
i
go
away
i
shall
be
writing
to
you
and
sending
some
pictures
of
the
children
and
you
must
let
me
know
how
you
are
getting
on
yes
there
is
one
thing
darlin
if
you
could
stop
in
the
village
an
pick

a
pritty
little
small
that
i
can
keep
for
my
own
an
have
to
remember
you
by
that
i
want
to
set
me
above
the
rest
o
the
folks
but
i
was
always
used
to

my
own
when
i
was
to
your
grandma
there
very
nice
folks
here

on
and
i

only
thing
i
feel
cropin
about
what
be
you
goin
right
back
for
ai
you
goin
to
see
the
great
fair
to
pheladelphy
that
everybody
talks
about
no
said
strafford
laughing
at
this
eager
and
almost
convicting
question
no
i
going
back
next
week
if
i
were
i
believe
that
i
should
take
you
with
me
dear
old
betsey
you
make
me
feel
as
if
i
were
a
little
girl
again
you
look
just
the
same
for
full
five
minutes
the
old
woman
stood
out
in
the
sunshine
dazed
with
delight
and
majestic
with
a
sense
of
her
own
consequence
she
held
something
tight
in
her
hand
without
thinking
what
it
might
be
but
just
as
the
friendly
mistress
of
the
came
out
to
hear
the
news
she
tucked
the
roll
of
money
into
the
bosom
of
her
brown
gingham
dress
was
my
dear
mis
katy
strafford
she
turned
to
say
proudly
she
come
way
over
from
london
she
been
sick
they
thought
the
voyage
would
do
her
good
she
said
most
the
first
thing
she
had
on
her
mind
was
to
come
an
find
me
and
see
how
i
was
an
if
i
was
comfortable
an
now
she
goin
right
back
she
got
two
splendid
houses
an
said
how
she
wished
i
was
there
to
look
after
things
she
remembered
i
was
always
her
right
hand
oh
it
does
so
carry
me
back
to
see
her
seems
if
all
the
rest
on
must
be
there
together
to
the
old
house
there
i
must
go
right
up
an
tell
mis
dow
an
peggy
dinner
all
ready
i
was
just
goin
to
blow
the
horn
for
the
said
the
keeper
wife
they
be
right
down
i
expect
you
got
along
smart
with
them
beans
all
three
of
you
together
but
betsey
mind
roved
so
high
and
so
far
at
that
moment
that
no
achievements
of
could
lure
it
back
iii
the
long
table
in
the
great
kitchen
soon
gathered
its
company
of
waifs
and
strays
creatures
of
improvidence
and
misfortune
and
the
irreparable
victims
of
old
age
the
dinner
was
satisfactory
and
there
was
not
much
delay
for
conversation
peggy
bond
and
dow
and
betsey
lane
always
sat
together
at
one
end
with
an
air
of
putting
the
rest
of
the
company
below
the
salt
betsey
was
still
flushed
with
excitement
in
fact
she
could
not
eat
as
much
as
usual
and
she
looked
up
from
time
to
time
expectantly
as
if
she
were
likely
to
be
asked
to
speak
of
her
guest
but
everybody
was
hungry
and
even
dow
broke
in
upon
some
attempted
confidences
by
asking
inopportunely
for
a
second
potato
there
were
nearly
twenty
at
the
table
counting
the
keeper
and
his
wife
and
two
children
noisy
little
persons
who
had
come
from
school
with
the
small
flock
belonging
to
the
poor
widow
who
sat
just
opposite
our
friends
she
finished
her
dinner
before
any
one
else
and
pushed
her
chair
back
she
always
helped
with
the
housework
a
thin
sorry
poor
soul
whom
grief
had
sharpened
instead
of
softening
i
expect
you
feel
too
fine
to
set
with
common
folks
she
said
enviously
to
betsey
here
i
be
responded
betsey
calmly
i
don
know
i
behave
more
unbecomin
than
usual
betsey
prided
herself
upon
her
good
and
proper
manners
but
the
rest
of
the
company
who
would
have
liked
to
hear
the
bit
of
morning
news
were
now
defrauded
of
that
pleasure
the
wrong
note
had
been
struck
there
was
a
silence
after
the
clatter
of
knives
and
plates
and
one
by
one
the
cheerful
town
charges
disappeared
the
had
been
finished
and
there
was
a
call
for
any
of
the
women
who
felt
like
planting
corn
so
peggy
bond
who
could
follow
the
line
of
hills
pretty
fairly
and
betsey
herself
who
was
still
equal
to
anybody
at
that
work
and
dow
all
went
out
to
the
field
together
aunt
lavina
labored
slowly
up
the
yard
carrying
a
light
kitchen
chair
and
her
and
sat
near
the
stone
wall
on
a
gentle
rise
where
she
could
see
the
pond
and
the
green
country
and
exchange
a
word
with
her
friends
as
they
came
and
went
up
and
down
the
rows
betsey
vouchsafed
a
word
now
and
then
about
strafford
but
you
would
have
thought
that
she
had
been
suddenly
elevated
to
strafford
own
cares
and
the
responsibilities
attending
them
and
had
little
in
common
with
her
old
associates
dow
and
peggy
knew
well
that
these
times
never
lasted
long
and
so
they
waited
with
as
much
patience
as
they
could
muster
they
were
by
no
means
without
that
true
tact
which
is
only
another
word
for
unselfish
sympathy
the
strip
of
corn
land
ran
along
the
side
of
a
great
field
at
the
upper
end
of
it
was
a
thicket
of
young
maples
and
walnut
saplings
the
children
of
a
great
that
marked
the
boundary
once
when
betsey
lane
found
herself
alone
near
this
shelter
at
the
end
of
her
row
the
other
planters
having
lagged
behind
beyond
the
rising
ground
she
looked
stealthily
about
and
then
put
her
hand
inside
her
gown
and
for
the
first
time
took
out
the
money
that
strafford
had
given
her
she
turned
it
over
and
over
with
an
astonished
look
there
were
new
for
a
hundred
dollars
betsey
gave
a
funny
little
shrug
of
her
shoulders
came
out
of
the
bushes
and
took
a
step
or
two
on
the
narrow
edge
of
turf
as
if
she
were
going
to
dance
then
she
hastily
tucked
away
her
treasure
and
stepped
discreetly
down
into
the
soft
harrowed
and
hoed
land
and
began
to
drop
corn
again
five
kernels
to
a
hill
she
had
seen
the
top
of
peggy
bond
head
over
the
knoll
and
now
peggy
herself
came
entirely
into
view
gazing
upward
to
the
skies
and
stumbling
more
or
less
but
counting
the
corn
by
touch
and
twisting
her
head
about
anxiously
to
gain
advantage
over
her
uncertain
vision
betsey
made
a
friendly
inarticulate
little
sound
as
they
passed
she
was
thinking
that
somebody
said
once
that
peggy
eyesight
might
be
remedied
if
she
could
go
to
boston
to
the
hospital
but
that
was
so
remote
and
impossible
an
undertaking
that
no
one
had
ever
taken
the
first
step
betsey
lane
brown
old
face
suddenly
worked
with
excitement
but
in
a
moment
more
she
regained
her
usual
firm
expression
and
spoke
carelessly
to
peggy
as
she
turned
and
came
alongside
the
high
spring
wind
of
the
morning
had
quite
fallen
it
was
a
lovely
may
afternoon
the
woods
about
the
field
to
the
northward
were
full
of
birds
and
the
young
leaves
scarcely
hid
the
solemn
shapes
of
a
company
of
crows
that
patiently
attended
the
two
of
the
men
had
finished
their
hoeing
and
were
busy
with
the
construction
of
a
scarecrow
they
knelt
in
the
furrows
chuckling
and
looking
over
some
forlorn
discarded
garments
it
was
a
custom
to
make
the
scarecrow
resemble
one
of
the
family
and
this
year
they
intended
to
have
lavina
dow
protect
the
field
in
effigy
last
year
it
was
the
counterfeit
of
betsey
lane
who
stood
on
guard
with
an
easily
recognized
quilted
hood
and
the
remains
of
a
valued
shawl
that
one
of
the
calves
had
found
airing
on
a
fence
and
chewed
to
pieces
behind
the
men
was
the
foundation
for
this
rustic
attempt
at
statuary
an
upright
stake
and
bar
in
the
form
of
a
cross
this
stood
on
the
highest
part
of
the
field
and
as
the
men
knelt
near
it
and
the
quaint
figures
of
the
went
and
came
the
scene
gave
a
curious
suggestion
of
foreign
life
it
was
not
like
new
england
the
presence
of
the
rude
cross
appealed
strangely
to
the
imagination
iv
life
flowed
so
smoothly
for
the
most
part
at
the
byfleet
that
nobody
knew
what
to
make
later
in
the
summer
of
a
strange
disappearance
all
the
elder
inmates
were
familiar
with
illness
and
death
and
the
poor
pomp
of
a
funeral
the
comings
and
goings
and
the
various
misfortunes
of
those
who
composed
this
strange
family
related
only
through
its
disasters
hardly
served
for
the
excitement
and
talk
of
a
single
day
now
that
the
june
days
were
at
their
longest
the
old
people
were
sure
to
wake
earlier
than
ever
but
one
morning
to
the
astonishment
of
every
one
betsey
lane
bed
was
empty
the
sheets
and
blankets
which
were
her
own
and
guarded
with
jealous
care
were
carefully
folded
and
placed
on
a
chair
not
too
near
the
window
and
betsey
had
flown
nobody
had
heard
her
go
down
the
creaking
stairs
the
kitchen
door
was
unlocked
and
the
old
watchdog
lay
on
the
step
outside
in
the
early
sunshine
wagging
his
tail
and
looking
wise
as
if
he
were
left
on
guard
and
meant
to
keep
the
fugitive
secret
never
knowed
her
to
do
nothin
afore
talking
it
over
a
fortnight
and
paradin
off
when
we
could
all
see
her
ventured
a
spiteful
voice
guess
we
can
wait
till
night
to
hear
it
dow
looked
sorrowful
and
shook
her
head
betsey
had
an
aunt
on
her
mother
side
that
went
and
drownded
of
herself
she
was
a
woman
as
ever
you
see
perhaps
she
gone
to
spend
the
day
with
decker
folks
suggested
peggy
bond
she
always
takes
an
extra
early
start
she
was
lately
o
going
up
their
way
but
dow
shook
her
head
with
a
most
melancholy
look
i
impressed
that
something
befell
her
she
insisted
i
heard
her
in
her
sleep
i
was
wakeful
the
forepart
o
the
night
is
very
unusual
with
me
too
like
betsey
not
to
leave
us
any
word
said
the
other
old
friend
with
more
resentment
than
melancholy
they
sat
together
almost
in
silence
that
morning
in
the
shed
chamber
dow
was
sorting
and
cutting
rags
and
peggy
braided
them
into
long
ropes
to
be
made
into
mats
at
a
later
date
if
they
had
only
known
where
betsey
lane
had
gone
they
might
have
talked
about
it
until
at
noon
but
failing
this
new
subject
they
could
take
no
interest
in
any
of
their
old
ones
out
in
the
field
the
corn
was
well
up
and
the
men
were
hoeing
it
was
a
hot
morning
in
the
shed
chamber
and
the
woolen
rags
were
dusty
and
hot
to
handle
byfleet
people
knew
each
other
well
and
when
this
mysteriously
absent
person
did
not
return
to
the
at
the
end
of
a
week
public
interest
became
much
excited
and
presently
it
was
ascertained
that
betsey
lane
was
neither
making
a
visit
to
her
friends
the
deckers
on
birch
hill
nor
to
any
nearer
acquaintances
in
fact
she
had
disappeared
altogether
from
her
wonted
haunts
nobody
remembered
to
have
seen
her
pass
hers
had
been
such
an
early
flitting
and
when
somebody
thought
of
her
having
gone
away
by
train
he
was
laughed
at
for
forgetting
that
the
earliest
morning
train
from
south
byfleet
the
nearest
station
did
not
start
until
long
after
eight
and
if
betsey
had
designed
to
be
one
of
the
passengers
she
would
have
started
along
the
road
at
seven
and
been
seen
and
known
of
all
women
there
was
not
a
kitchen
in
that
part
of
byfleet
that
did
not
have
windows
toward
the
road
conversation
rarely
left
the
level
of
the
neighborhood
gossip
to
see
betsey
lane
in
her
best
clothes
at
that
hour
in
the
morning
would
have
been
the
signal
for
much
exercise
of
imagination
but
as
day
after
day
went
by
without
news
the
curiosity
of
those
who
knew
her
best
turned
slowly
into
fear
and
at
last
peggy
bond
again
gave
utterance
to
the
belief
that
betsey
had
either
gone
out
in
the
early
morning
and
put
an
end
to
her
life
or
that
she
had
gone
to
the
centennial
some
of
the
people
at
table
were
moved
to
loud
laughter
it
was
at
on
a
sunday
night
but
others
listened
with
great
interest
she
never
put
on
her
good
clothes
to
drownd
herself
said
the
widow
she
might
have
thought
was
good
as
takin
with
her
though
old
folks
has
wandered
off
an
got
lost
in
the
woods
afore
now
dow
and
peggy
resented
this
impertinent
remark
but
deigned
to
take
no
notice
of
the
speaker
she
would
have
wore
her
best
clothes
to
the
centennial
would
she
mildly
inquired
peggy
bobbing
her
head
toward
the
ceiling
be
a
shame
to
spoil
your
best
things
in
such
a
place
an
i
do
know
of
her
havin
any
money
there
the
end
o
that
you
bad
as
old
mis
bland
that
used
to
live
neighbor
to
our
folks
said
one
of
the
old
men
she
was
dreadful
precise
an
she
so
begretched
to
wear
a
good
alapaca
dress
that
was
left
to
her
that
it
hung
in
a
press
forty
year
an
baited
the
moths
at
last
i
often
seen
mis
bland
in
to
meetin
when
i
was
a
young
girl
said
peggy
bond
approvingly
she
was
a
woman
an
she
left
property
wish
she
left
it
to
me
then
said
the
poor
soul
opposite
glancing
at
her
pathetic
row
of
children
but
it
was
not
good
manners
at
the
farm
to
deplore
one
situation
and
dow
and
peggy
only
frowned
where
do
you
suppose
betsey
can
be
said
dow
for
the
twentieth
time
she
did
have
no
money
i
know
she
ai
gone
far
if
it
so
that
she
yet
alive
she
real
pinched
all
the
spring
perhaps
that
lady
that
come
one
day
give
her
some
the
keeper
wife
suggested
mildly
then
betsey
would
have
told
me
said
dow
with
injured
dignity
vi
on
the
morning
of
her
disappearance
betsey
rose
even
before
the
pewee
and
the
english
sparrow
and
dressed
herself
quietly
though
with
trembling
hands
and
stole
out
of
the
kitchen
door
like
a
plunderless
thief
the
old
dog
licked
her
hand
and
looked
at
her
anxiously
the
cat
rubbed
against
her
best
gown
and
trotted
away
up
the
yard
then
she
turned
anxiously
and
came
after
the
old
woman
following
faithfully
until
she
had
to
be
driven
back
betsey
was
used
to
long
country
excursions
afoot
she
dearly
loved
the
early
morning
and
finding
that
there
was
no
dew
to
trouble
her
she
began
to
follow
pasture
paths
and
short
cuts
across
the
fields
surprising
here
and
there
a
flock
of
sleepy
sheep
or
a
startled
calf
that
rustled
out
from
the
bushes
the
birds
were
pecking
their
breakfast
from
bush
and
turf
and
hardly
any
of
the
wild
inhabitants
of
that
rural
world
were
enough
alarmed
by
her
presence
to
do
more
than
flutter
away
if
they
chanced
to
be
in
her
path
she
stepped
along
and
eager
as
a
girl
dressed
in
her
neat
old
straw
bonnet
and
black
gown
and
carrying
a
few
belongings
in
her
best
one
that
her
only
brother
had
brought
home
from
the
east
indies
fifty
years
before
there
was
an
old
crow
perched
as
sentinel
on
a
small
dead
where
he
could
warn
friends
who
were
pulling
up
the
sprouted
corn
in
a
field
close
by
but
he
only
gave
a
contemptuous
caw
as
the
adventurer
appeared
and
she
shook
her
bundle
at
him
in
revenge
and
laughed
to
see
him
so
clumsy
as
he
tried
to
keep
his
footing
on
the
twigs
yes
i
be
she
assured
him
i
to
pheladelphy
to
the
centennial
same
other
folks
i
jest
as
soon
tell
ye
not
old
crow
and
betsey
laughed
aloud
in
pleased
content
with
herself
and
her
daring
as
she
walked
along
she
had
only
two
miles
to
go
to
the
station
at
south
byfleet
and
she
felt
for
the
money
now
and
then
and
found
it
safe
enough
she
took
great
pride
in
the
success
of
her
escape
and
especially
in
the
long
concealment
of
her
wealth
not
a
night
had
passed
since
strafford
visit
that
she
had
not
slept
with
the
roll
of
money
under
her
pillow
by
night
and
buttoned
safe
inside
her
dress
by
day
she
knew
that
everybody
would
offer
advice
and
even
commands
about
the
spending
or
saving
of
it
and
she
brooked
no
interference
the
last
mile
of
the
to
south
byfleet
was
along
the
railway
track
and
betsey
began
to
feel
in
haste
though
it
was
still
nearly
two
hours
to
train
time
she
looked
anxiously
forward
and
back
along
the
rails
every
few
minutes
for
fear
of
being
run
over
and
at
last
she
caught
sight
of
an
engine
that
was
apparently
coming
toward
her
and
took
flight
into
the
woods
before
she
could
gather
courage
to
follow
the
path
again
the
freight
train
proved
to
be
at
a
standstill
waiting
at
a
turnout
and
some
of
the
men
were
straying
about
eating
their
early
breakfast
comfortably
in
this
time
of
leisure
as
the
old
woman
came
up
to
them
she
stopped
too
for
a
moment
of
rest
and
conversation
where
be
ye
goin
she
asked
pleasantly
and
they
told
her
it
was
to
the
town
where
she
had
to
change
cars
and
take
the
great
through
train
a
point
of
geography
which
she
had
learned
from
evening
talks
between
the
men
at
the
farm
what
ye
carry
me
there
for
we
do
run
no
passenger
cars
said
one
of
the
young
fellows
laughing
what
makes
you
in
such
a
hurry
i
startin
for
pheladelphy
an
it
a
ways
to
go
is
but
you
early
if
you
makin
for
the
train
see
here
you
have
got
a
needle
an
thread
of
you
in
that
bundle
have
you
if
you
sew
me
on
a
couple
buttons
i
give
ye
a
free
ride
i
in
a
sight
o
distress
none
o
the
fellows
is
provided
with
as
much
as
a
bent
pin
you
poor
boy
i
have
you
seen
to
in
half
a
minute
i
troubled
with
a
stiff
arm
but
i
do
the
best
i
can
the
obliging
betsey
seated
herself
stiffly
on
the
slope
of
the
embankment
and
found
her
thread
and
needle
with
utmost
haste
two
of
the
stood
by
and
watched
the
careful
stitches
and
even
offered
her
a
place
as
spare
brakeman
so
that
they
might
keep
her
near
and
betsey
took
the
offer
with
considerable
seriousness
only
thinking
it
necessary
to
assure
them
that
she
was
getting
most
too
old
to
be
out
in
all
weathers
an
express
went
by
like
an
earthquake
and
she
was
presently
hoisted
on
board
an
empty
by
two
of
her
new
and
flattering
acquaintances
and
found
herself
before
noon
at
the
end
of
the
first
stage
of
her
journey
without
having
spent
a
cent
and
furnished
with
any
amount
of
thrifty
advice
one
of
the
young
men
being
compassionate
of
her
unprotected
state
as
a
traveler
advised
her
to
find
out
the
widow
of
an
uncle
of
his
in
philadelphia
saying
despairingly
that
he
could
tell
her
just
how
to
find
the
house
but
miss
betsey
lane
said
that
she
had
an
english
tongue
in
her
head
and
should
be
sure
to
find
whatever
she
was
looking
for
this
unexpected
incident
of
the
freight
train
was
the
reason
why
everybody
about
the
south
byfleet
station
insisted
that
no
such
person
had
taken
passage
by
the
regular
train
that
same
morning
and
why
there
were
those
who
persuaded
themselves
that
miss
betsey
lane
was
probably
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
pond
vii
land
sakes
said
miss
betsey
lane
as
she
watched
a
turkish
person
parading
by
in
his
red
fez
i
call
the
centennial
somethin
like
the
day
o
judgment
i
wish
i
was
goin
to
stop
a
month
but
i
dare
say
be
the
death
o
my
poor
old
bones
she
was
leaning
against
the
barrier
of
a
patent
establishment
which
had
given
her
a
sudden
reminder
of
home
and
of
the
winter
nights
when
the
little
red
and
yellow
ears
were
brought
out
and
old
uncle
eph
flanders
sat
by
the
kitchen
stove
and
solemnly
filled
a
great
wooden
for
the
refreshment
of
the
company
she
had
wandered
and
loitered
and
looked
until
her
eyes
and
head
had
grown
numb
and
unreceptive
but
it
is
only
unimaginative
persons
who
can
be
really
astonished
the
imagination
can
always
outrun
the
possible
and
actual
sights
and
sounds
of
the
world
and
this
plain
old
body
from
byfleet
rarely
found
anything
rich
and
splendid
enough
to
surprise
her
she
saw
the
wonders
of
the
west
and
the
splendors
of
the
east
with
equal
calmness
and
satisfaction
she
had
always
known
that
there
was
an
amazing
world
outside
the
boundaries
of
byfleet
there
was
a
piece
of
paper
in
her
pocket
on
which
was
marked
in
her
clumsy
handwriting
if
betsey
lane
should
meet
with
accident
notify
the
selectmen
of
byfleet
but
having
made
this
slight
provision
for
the
future
she
had
thrown
herself
boldly
into
the
sea
of
strangers
and
then
had
made
the
joyful
discovery
that
friends
were
to
be
found
at
every
turn
there
was
something
delightfully
companionable
about
betsey
she
had
a
way
of
suddenly
looking
up
over
her
big
spectacles
with
a
reassuring
and
expectant
smile
as
if
you
were
going
to
speak
to
her
and
you
generally
did
she
must
have
found
out
where
hundreds
of
people
came
from
and
whom
they
had
left
at
home
and
what
they
thought
of
the
great
show
as
she
sat
on
a
bench
to
rest
or
leaned
over
the
railings
where
free
luncheons
were
afforded
by
the
makers
of
hot
waffles
and
molasses
candy
and
fried
potatoes
and
there
was
not
a
night
when
she
did
not
return
to
her
lodgings
with
a
pocket
crammed
with
samples
of
spool
cotton
and
nobody
knows
what
she
had
already
collected
small
presents
for
almost
everybody
she
knew
at
home
and
she
was
such
a
pleasant
beaming
old
country
body
so
unmistakably
appreciative
and
interested
that
nobody
ever
thought
of
wishing
that
she
would
move
on
nearly
all
the
busy
people
of
the
exhibition
called
her
either
aunty
or
grandma
at
once
and
made
little
pleasures
for
her
as
best
they
could
she
was
a
delightful
contrast
to
the
indifferent
stupid
crowd
that
drifted
along
with
eyes
fixed
at
the
same
level
and
seeing
even
on
that
level
nothing
for
fifty
feet
at
a
time
what
be
you
making
here
dear
betsey
lane
would
ask
joyfully
and
the
most
perfunctory
guardian
hastened
to
explain
she
squandered
money
as
she
had
never
had
the
pleasure
of
doing
before
and
this
hastened
the
day
when
she
must
return
to
byfleet
she
was
always
inquiring
if
there
were
any
at
hand
and
received
occasional
directions
but
it
was
a
difficult
place
for
her
to
find
her
way
about
in
and
the
very
last
day
of
her
stay
arrived
before
she
found
an
exhibitor
of
the
desired
sort
an
oculist
and
i
called
to
get
some
specs
for
a
friend
that
upsighted
she
gravely
informed
the
salesman
to
his
extreme
amusement
dreadful
troubled
and
jerks
her
head
up
like
a
hen
got
a
blur
an
spreadin
an
sometimes
she
can
see
out
to
one
side
o
and
more
times
she
ca
cataracts
said
a
gentleman
at
her
side
and
betsey
lane
turned
to
regard
him
with
approval
and
curiosity
is
miss
peggy
bond
i
was
mentioning
of
byfleet
she
explained
i
count
on
gettin
some
glasses
to
relieve
her
trouble
if
there
any
to
be
found
glasses
wo
do
her
any
good
said
the
stranger
suppose
you
come
and
sit
down
on
this
bench
and
tell
me
all
about
it
first
where
is
byfleet
and
betsey
gave
the
directions
at
length
i
thought
so
said
the
surgeon
how
old
is
this
friend
of
yours
betsey
cleared
her
throat
decisively
and
smoothed
her
gown
over
her
knees
as
if
it
were
an
apron
then
she
turned
to
take
a
good
look
at
her
new
acquaintance
as
they
sat
on
the
rustic
bench
together
who
be
you
sir
i
should
like
to
know
she
asked
in
a
friendly
tone
my
name
dunster
i
take
it
you
a
doctor
continued
betsey
as
if
they
had
overtaken
each
other
walking
from
byfleet
to
south
byfleet
on
a
summer
morning
i
a
doctor
part
of
one
at
least
said
he
i
know
more
or
less
about
eyes
and
i
spend
my
summers
down
on
the
shore
at
the
mouth
of
your
river
some
day
i
come
up
and
look
at
this
person
how
old
is
she
peggy
bond
is
one
that
never
tells
her
age
come
quite
up
to
where
she
begin
to
brag
of
it
you
see
explained
betsey
reluctantly
but
i
know
her
to
be
nigh
to
one
way
or
her
an
mary
ann
chick
was
same
year
and
peggy
knows
i
know
it
an
two
or
three
times
when
we
in
the
where
mary
ann
lays
an
has
her
dates
right
on
her
headstone
i
could
bring
peggy
to
take
no
sort
o
notice
i
will
say
she
makes
at
times
a
convenience
of
being
upsighted
but
there
i
feel
for
her
everybody
does
it
keeps
her
stubbin
an
against
everything
beakin
and
gazin
up
the
way
she
has
to
yes
yes
said
the
doctor
whose
eyes
were
twinkling
i
come
and
look
after
her
with
your
town
doctor
this
summer
some
time
in
the
last
of
july
or
first
of
august

betsey
not
without
an
air
of
patronage
most
of
us

the
byfleet
farm

got
our
ails
now
i
tell
ye
you
ai
got
no
bitters
that

a
dozen
years
right
off
an
ol
lady
shoulders
the
busy
man
smiled
pleasantly
and
shook
his
head
as
he
went
away
dunster
said
betsey
to
herself
soberly
committing
the
new
name
to
her
sound
memory
yes
i
must
forget
to
speak
of
him
to
the
doctor
as
he
directed
i

peggy

vally
herself
quite
so
much
accordin
to
if
she
had
her
eyes
fixed

as

expect
there

a
smarter
woman
in

i
set

shawl
i
always
wanted
to
have
a
real
good
time
an
now
havin
it
viii
two
or
three
days
later
two
pathetic
figures
might
have
been
seen
crossing
the
slopes
of
the
field
toward
the
low
shores
of
byfield
pond
it
was
early
in
the
morning
and
the
stubble
of
the
lately
mown
grass
was
wet
with
rain
and
hindering
to
old
feet
peggy
bond
was
more
blundering
and
liable
to
stray
in
the
wrong
direction
than
usual
it
was
one
of
the
days
when
she
could
hardly
see
at
all
aunt
lavina
dow
was
unusually
clumsy
of
movement
and
stiff
in
the
joints
she
had
not
been
so
far
from
the
house
for
three
years
the
morning
breeze
filled
the
gathers
of
her
wide
gingham
skirt
and
aggravated
the
size
of
her
unwieldy
figure
she
supported
herself
with
a
stick
and
trusted
beside
to
the
fragile
support
of
peggy
arm
they
were
talking
together
in
whispers
oh
my
sakes
exclaimed
peggy
moving
her
small
head
from
side
to
side

wheeze

of

of

top
o
the
pond
this
day

nine
days
since

now
i
tell

to
hope
we
find
her
i
must
say
faltered
peggy
it
was
plain
that
dow
was
the
captain
of
this
doleful
expedition
i
guess
she
ai
never
thought
o
drowndin
of
herself
mis
dow
gone
off
way
over
to
the
other
side
o
south
byfleet

proper
means

dow
indignantly
an
if
you
prefer
that

find
her
floatin
to
the
top
this
day
instid
of
us
that
her
best
friends
you
can
step
back
to
the
house
they
walked
on
in
aggrieved
silence
peggy
bond
trembled
with
excitement
but
her
companion
firm
grasp
never
wavered
and
so
they
came
to
the
narrow
gravelly
margin
and
stood
still
peggy
tried
in
vain
to
see
the
glittering
water
and
the
that
starred
it
she
knew
that
they
must
be
there
once
years
ago
she
had
caught
fleeting
glimpses
of
them
and
she
never
forgot
what
she
had
once
seen
the
clear
blue
sky
overhead
the
dark
beyond
the
pond
were
all
clearly
pictured
in
her
mind
ca
you
see
nothin
she
faltered
i
believe

upsighted
this
day
i
going
to
be
blind
no

ai
why

exclaimed
a
brisk
and
cheerful
voice
there
stood

herself
close
behind
them
having
just
emerged
from
a
thicket
of
alders
that
grew
close
by

short
way
homeward
from

railroad

the

pleasant

with
sublime
you

as

how
they
made

but
i
full
o
dust
now
an
pretty
nigh
beat
out
i
never
see
a
place
more
friendly
than
pheladelphy
but
natural
to
a
byfleet
person
to
be
always
walkin
on
a
level
there
now
peggy
you
take
my
and
the
basket
and
let
mis
dow
sag
on
to
me
i
git
her
along
twice
as
easy
with
this
the
small
elderly
company
set
forth
triumphant
toward
the
across
the
wide
green
field
gray
mills
of
the
mills
of
farley
were
close
together
by
the
river
and
the
gray
houses
that
belonged
to
them
stood
tall
and
bare
alongside
they
had
no
room
for
gardens
or
even
for
little
green
where
one
might
spend
a
summer
evening
the
corporation
as
this
compact
village
was
called
by
those
who
lived
in
it
was
small
but
solid
you
fancied
yourself
in
the
heart
of
a
large
town
when
you
stood
of
one
of
its
short
streets
but
from
the
street
end
you
faced
a
wide
green
farming
country
on
spring
and
summer
sundays
groups
of
the
young
folks
of
the
corporation
would
stray
out
along
the
country
roads
but
it
was
very
seldom
that
any
of
the
older
people
went
on
the
whole
it
seemed
as
if
the
closer
you
lived
to
the
gate
the
better
you
had
more
time
to
loiter
on
a
summer
morning
and
there
was
less
distance
to
plod
through
the
winter
snows
and
rains
the
last
stroke
of
the
bell
saw
almost
everybody
within
the
mill
doors
there
were
always
fluffs
of
cotton
in
the
air
like
great
white
bees
drifting
down
out
of
the
picker
chimney
they
lodged
in
the
cramped
and
dingy
elms
and
which
a
former
agent
had
planted
along
the
streets
and
the
english
sparrows
squabbled
over
them
in
and
made
warm
untidy
great
nests
that
would
have
contented
an
arctic
explorer
somehow
the
corporation
homes
looked
like
houses
or
huge
they
had
so
little
individuality
or
likeness
to
the
buildings
that
made
homes
for
people
out
on
the
farms
there
was
more
homelikeness
in
the
sparrows
nests
or
even
the
toylike
railroad
station
at
the
end
of
the
main
street
for
that
was
warmed
by
steam
and
the
wife
thriftily
taking
advantage
of
the
steady
heat
brought
her
there
and
kept
them
all
winter
on
the
broad
the
corporation
had
followed
the
usual
fortunes
of
new
england
manufacturing
villages
its
operatives
were
at
first
eager
young
men
and
women
from
the
farms
near
by
these
being
joined
quickly
by
pale
english
weavers
and
spinners
with
their
wives
and
rosy
children
then
came
the
flock
of
irish
families
poorer
and
simpler
than
the
others
but
learning
the
work
sooner
and
now
the
contingent
furnished
all
the
new
help
and
stood
in
long
rows
before
the
noisy
looms
and
chattered
in
their
odd
excited
fashion
they
were
and
were
willing
to
work
cheaper
than
any
other
workpeople
yet
there
were
remnants
of
each
of
these
human
tides
to
be
found
as
one
looked
about
the
mills
old
henry
dow
the
overseer
of
the
was
a
lancashire
man
and
some
of
his
grandchildren
had
risen
to
wealth
and
prominence
in
another
part
of
the
country
while
he
kept
steadily
on
with
his
familiar
work
and
authority
a
good
many
elderly
irishmen
and
women
still
kept
their
places
everybody
knew
the
two
old
sweepers
mary
cassidy
and
kilpatrick
who
were
looked
upon
as
pillars
of
the
corporation
they
and
their
compatriots
always
held
loyally
together
and
openly
resented
the
incoming
of
so
many
french
you
would
never
have
thought
that
the
french
were
for
a
moment
conscious
of
being
in
the
least
unwelcome
they
came
gayly
into
church
and
crowded
the
old
parishioners
of
michael
out
of
their
pews
as
on
they
took
their
places
at
the
looms
hardly
one
of
the
old
parishioners
had
not
taken
occasion
to
speak
of
such
aggressions
to
father
daley
the
priest
but
father
daley
continued
to
look
upon
them
all
as
souls
to
be
saved
and
took
continual
pains
to
rub
up
the
rusty
french
which
he
had
nearly
forgotten
in
order
to
preach
a
special
sermon
every
other
sunday
this
caused
old
mary
cassidy
to
shake
her
head
gravely
mis
kilpatrick
she
said
one
morning
faix
they
folks
at
all
is
but
a
pack
of
images
they
do
be
with
all
their
chatter
like
birds
in
a
hedge
sure
then
the
holy
saint
francis
himself
was
after
saying
that
the
little
birds
was
his
sisters
answered
kilpatrick
a
godly
old
woman
who
made
the
stations
every
morning
and
was
often
seen
reading
a
book
of
devotion
she
was
moreover
always
ready
with
a
friendly
joke
they
ai
the
same
at
all
was
in
them
innocent
times
when
there
was
plenty
saints
living
in
the
world
insisted
mary
cassidy
look
at
them
thrash
now
the
old
were
going
downstairs
with
their
brooms
it
was
almost
twelve
and
like
the
old
in
the
mill
yard
they
slackened
work
in
good
season
for
the
noonday
bell
three
gay
young
french
girls
ran
downstairs
past
them
they
were
let
out
for
the
afternoon
and
were
hurrying
home
to
dress
and
catch
the
train
to
the
next
large
town
that
little
one
is
meshell
daughter
she
a
nice
child
too
very
quiet
and
has
got
more
christian
tark
than
most
said
kilpatrick
they
live
overhead
o
me
there
nine
o
themselves
in
the
two
rooms
two
does
be
boarders
those
upper
rooms
bees
very
large
entirely
at
fitzgibbon
said
mary
cassidy
with
unusual
indulgence
is
all
the
company
cares
about
is
to
get
a
good
rent
out
of
the
pay
they
asked
every
little
while
by
honest
folks
they
build
a
trifle
o
small
houses
beyond
the
church
up
there
but
no
rather
the
money
and
kape
us
like
bees
in
them
old
hives
sure
in
winter
we
better
for
having
the
more
fires
but
summer
is
the
pinance
they
all
says
do
folks
build
their
own
houses
they
does
always
be
talking
about
mike
callahan
and
how
well
he
saved
up
and
owns
a
pritty
place
for
himself
convanient
to
his
work
you
might
tell
them
he
money
left
him
by
a
brother
in
california
till
you
be
black
in
the
face
they
stick
to
it
was
in
the
picker
he
earnt
it
from
themselves
grumbled
mary
cassidy
them
french
spinds
all
their
money
on
their
backs
do
they
suggested
kilpatrick
as
if
to
divert
the
conversation
from
dangerous
channels
look
at
them
three
girls
now
off
to
spincer
with
their
fortnight
pay
in
their
pocket
a
couple
o
onions
and
a
bag
o
crackers
is
all
they
want
and
a
pinch
o
lard
to
their
butter
pronounced
mary
cassidy
with
scorn
the
whole
town
of
be
the
worse
of
a
dollar
for
steak
the
week
round
they
all
go
back
and
buy
land
in
canada
they
spend
no
money
here
see
how
well
they
forget
their
pocketbooks
every
sunday
for
the
collection
they
do
be
very
light
too
they
more
laugh
than
ourselves
is
myself
getting
old
anyway
i
do
laugh
much
now
i
like
to
see
a
pritty
girl
look
fine
said
kilpatrick
no
they
do
be
young
but
once
the
mill
bell
rang
and
there
was
a
moment
hush
of
the
jarring
racketing
machinery
and
a
sudden
noise
of
many
feet
trampling
across
the
dry
hard
pine
floors
first
came
an
early
flight
of
boys
bursting
out
of
the
different
doors
and
chasing
one
another
down
the
winding
stairs
two
steps
at
a
time
the
old
sweepers
who
had
not
quite
reached
the
bottom
stood
back
against
the
wall
for
safety
sake
until
all
these
had
passed
then
they
kept
on
their
careful
way
the
crowd
passing
them
by
as
if
they
were
caught
in
an
eddy
of
the
stream
last
of
all
they
kept
sober
company
with
two
or
three
lame
persons
and
a
cheerful
delayed
little
group
of
new
doffers
the
children
who
minded
bobbins
in
the
and
who
were
young
enough
to
be
tired
and
even
timid
one
of
these
doffers
a
pale
child
was
all
fluffy
with
cotton
that
had
clung
to
her
little
dark
plaid
dress
when
kilpatrick
spoke
to
her
she
answered
in
a
hoarse
voice
that
appealed
to
one
sympathy
you
felt
that
the
hot
room
and
dry
cotton
were
to
blame
for
such
hoarseness
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
weather
where
are
you
living
now
maggie
dear
the
old
woman
asked
i
in
callahan
yet
but
they
wo
keep
me
after
said
the
child
there
a
man
wants
to
get
board
there
they
changing
round
in
the
rooms
and
they
no
place
for
me
mis
callahan
could
keep
me
i
get
my
pay
raised
kilpatrick
gave
a
quick
glance
at
mary
cassidy
come
home
with
me
then
till
yez
get
a
bite
o
dinner
and
we
talk
about
it
she
said
kindly
to
the
child
i
a
wish
for
company
the
day
the
two
old
companions
had
locked
their
brooms
into
a
closet
at
the
and
were
crossing
the
mill
yard
together
they
were
so
much
slower
than
the
rest
that
they
could
only
see
the
very
last
of
the
crowd
of
mill
people
disappearing
along
the
streets
and
into
the
doors
it
was
late
autumn
the
elms
were
bare
one
could
see
the
whole
village
of
farley
all
its
poverty
and
lack
of
beauty
at
one
glance
the
large
houses
looked
as
if
they
belonged
to
a
toy
village
and
had
been
carefully
put
in
rows
by
a
childish
hand
it
was
easy
to
lose
all
sense
of
size
in
looking
at
them
a
cold
wind
was
blowing
bits
of
waste
and
paper
high
into
the
air
now
and
then
a
snowflake
went
swiftly
by
like
a
courier
of
winter
mary
cassidy
and
kilpatrick
hugged
their
old
woolen
shawls
closer
about
their
round
shoulders
and
the
little
girl
followed
with
short
steps
alongside
ii
the
agent
of
the
mills
was
a
single
man
keen
and
but
quietly
kind
to
the
people
under
his
charge
sometimes
in
times
of
peace
when
one
looks
among
one
neighbors
wondering
who
would
make
the
great
soldiers
and
leaders
if
there
came
a
sudden
call
to
war
one
knows
with
a
flash
of
recognition
the
presence
of
military
genius
in
such
a
man
as
he
the
agent
spent
his
days
in
following
what
seemed
to
many
observers
to
be
only
a
dull
routine
but
all
his
steadiness
of
purpose
all
his
simple
intentness
all
his
gifts
of
strategy
and
powers
of
foresight
and
of
turning
an
interruption
into
an
opportunity
were
brought
to
bear
upon
this
dull
routine
with
a
keen
pleasure
a
man
in
his
place
must
know
not
only
how
to
lead
men
but
how
to
make
the
combination
of
their
force
with
the
machinery
take
its
place
as
a
factor
in
the
business
of
manufacturing
to
master
workmen
and
keep
the
mills
in
running
order
and
to
sell
the
goods
successfully
in
open
market
is
as
easy
to
do
badly
as
it
is
difficult
to
do
well
the
agent
father
and
mother
young
people
who
lived
for
a
short
time
in
the
village
had
both
died
when
he
was
only
three
years
old
and
between
that
time
and
his
ninth
year
he
had
learned
almost
everything
that
poverty
could
teach
being
left
like
little
maggie
to
the
mercy
of
his
neighbors
he
remembered
with
a
grateful
heart
those
who
were
good
to
him
and
told
him
of
his
mother
who
had
married
for
love
but
unwisely
kilpatrick
was
one
of
these
old
friends
who
said
that
his
mother
was
a
lady
but
even
kilpatrick
who
was
a
walking
history
of
the
corporation
had
never
known
his
mother
maiden
name
much
less
the
place
of
her
birth
the
first
great
revelation
of
life
had
come
when
the
boy
had
money
in
his
hand
to
pay
his
board
he
was
conscious
of
being
looked
at
with
a
difference
the
very
woman
who
had
been
hardest
to
him
and
let
him
mind
her
babies
all
the
morning
when
he
careful
little
soul
was
hardly
more
than
a
baby
himself
and
then
pushed
him
out
into
the
hungry
street
at
dinner
time
was
the
first
one
who
beckoned
him
now
willing
to
make
the
most
of
his
dollar
and
a
quarter
a
week
it
seemed
easy
enough
to
rise
from
uttermost
poverty
and
dependence
to
where
one
could
set
his
mind
upon
the
highest
honor
in
sight
that
of
being
agent
of
the
mills
or
to
work
one
way
steadily
to
where
such
an
honor
was
grasped
at
every
year
the
horizon
had
set
its
bounds
wider
and
wider
until
the
mills
of
farley
held
but
a
small
place
in
the
manufacturing
world
there
were
offers
enough
of
more
salary
and
higher
position
from
those
who
came
to
know
the
agent
but
he
was
part
of
farley
itself
and
had
come
to
care
deeply
about
his
neighbors
while
a
larger
mill
and
salary
were
not
exactly
the
things
that
could
tempt
his
ambition
it
was
but
a
lonely
life
for
a
man
in
the
old
quarters
where
one
of
the
widows
of
the
corporation
a
woman
who
had
been
brought
up
in
a
gentleman
house
in
the
old
country
kept
house
for
him
with
a
certain
show
of
propriety
ever
since
he
was
a
boy
his
room
was
never
without
its
late
evening
light
and
books
and
hard
study
made
his
chief
companionship
as
kilpatrick
went
home
holding
little
maggie
by
the
hand
that
windy
noon
the
agent
was
sitting
in
the
company
with
one
of
the
directors
and
largest
stockholders
and
they
were
just
ending
a
long
talk
about
the
mill
affairs
the
agent
was
about
forty
years
old
now
and
looked
fifty
he
had
a
pleasant
smile
but
one
saw
it
rarely
enough
and
just
now
he
looked
more
serious
than
usual
i
am
very
glad
to
have
had
this
long
talk
with
you
said
the
old
director
you
do
not
think
of
any
other
recommendations
to
be
made
at
the
meeting
next
week
the
agent
grew
a
trifle
paler
and
glanced
behind
him
to
be
sure
that
the
clerks
had
gone
to
dinner
not
in
regard
to
details
he
answered
gravely
there
is
one
thing
which
i
see
to
be
very
important
you
have
seen
the
books
and
are
clear
that
nine
per
cent
dividend
can
easily
be
declared
very
creditable
very
creditable
agreed
the
director
he
had
recognized
the
agent
ability
from
the
first
and
always
upheld
him
generously
i
mean
to
propose
a
special
vote
of
thanks
for
your
management
there
is
a
minor
corporation
in
new
england
that
stands
so
well
the
agent
listened
we
had
some
advantages
partly
by
accident
and
partly
by
lucky
foresight
he
acknowledged
i
am
going
to
ask
your
backing
in
something
that
seems
to
me
not
only
just
but
important
i
hope
that
you
will
not
declare
above
a
six
per
cent
dividend
at
that
directors
meeting
at
the
most
seven
per
he
said
what
what
exclaimed
the
listener
no
sir
the
agent
left
his
and
stood
before
the
old
director
as
if
he
were
pleading
for
himself
a
look
of
protest
and
disappointment
changed
the
elder
man
face
and
hardened
it
a
little
and
the
agent
saw
it
you
know
the
general
condition
of
the
people
here
he
explained
humbly
i
have
taken
great
pains
to
keep
hold
of
the
best
that
have
come
here
we
can
depend
upon
them
now
and
upon
the
quality
of
their
work
they
made
no
resistance
when
we
had
to
cut
down
wages
two
years
ago
on
the
contrary
they
were
surprisingly
reasonable
and
you
know
that
we
shut
down
for
several
weeks
at
the
time
of
the
alterations
we
have
never
put
their
wages
back
as
we
might
easily
have
done
and
i
happen
to
know
that
a
good
many
families
have
been
able
to
save
little
or
nothing
some
of
them
have
been
working
here
for
three
generations
they
know
as
well
as
you
and
i
and
the
books
do
when
the
mills
are
making
money
now
i
wish
that
we
could
give
them
the
ten
per
cent
back
again
but
in
view
of
the
general
depression
perhaps
we
ca
do
that
except
in
the
way
i
mean
i
think
that
next
year
we
going
to
have
a
very
hard
pull
to
get
along
but
if
we
can
keep
back
three
per
or
even
two
of
this
dividend
we
can
not
only
manage
to
get
on
without
a
or
touching
our
surplus
which
is
quite
small
enough
but
i
can
have
some
painting
and
repairing
done
in
the
tenements
they
needed
it
for
a
long
time
the
old
director
sprang
to
his
feet
are
the
stockholders
going
to
have
any
rights
then
he
demanded
within
fifteen
years
we
have
had
three
years
when
we
have
passed
our
dividends
but
the
operatives
never
can
lose
a
single
day
pay
that
was
before
my
time
said
the
agent
quietly
we
have
averaged
nearly
six
and
a
half
per
cent
a
year
taking
the
last
twenty
years
together
and
if
you
go
back
farther
the
average
is
even
larger
this
has
always
been
a
paying
property
we
got
our
new
machinery
now
and
everything
in
the
mills
themselves
is
just
where
we
want
it
i
look
for
far
better
times
after
this
next
year
but
the
market
is
glutted
with
goods
of
our
kind
and
nothing
is
going
to
be
gained
by
and
forcing
goods
into
it
still
i
can
keep
things
going
one
way
and
another
making
yarn
and
so
on
he
said
pleadingly
i
should
like
to
feel
that
we
had
this
extra
surplus
i
believe
that
we
owe
it
to
our
operatives
the
director
had
walked
heavily
to
the
window
and
put
his
hands
deep
into
his
he
had
an
angry
sense
that
the
agent
hands
were
in
his
pockets
too
i
got
some
pride
about
that
nine
per
sir
he
said
loftily
to
the
agent
so
have
i
said
the
agent
and
the
two
men
looked
each
other
in
the
face
i
acknowledge
my
duty
to
the
stockholders
said
the
younger
man
presently
i
have
tried
to
remember
that
duty
ever
since
i
took
the
mills
eight
years
ago
but
we
got
an
excellent
body
of
operatives
and
we
ought
to
keep
them
i
want
to
show
them
this
next
year
that
we
value
their
help
if
times
are
as
bad
as
we
fear
we
shall
still
have
the
money
nonsense
they
think
they
own
the
mills
now
said
the
director
but
he
was
uncomfortable
in
spite
of
believing
he
was
right
where
my
hat
i
must
have
my
luncheon
now
and
afterward
there
hardly
be
time
to
go
down
and
look
at
the
new
with
you
i
must
be
off
on
the
train
the
agent
sighed
and
led
the
way
there
was
no
use
in
saying
anything
more
and
he
knew
it
as
they
walked
along
they
met
old
kilpatrick
returning
from
her
brief
noonday
meal
with
little
maggie
whose
childish
face
was
radiant
the
old
woman
recognized
one
of
the
directors
and
dropped
him
a
decent
curtsey
as
she
had
been
taught
to
salute
the
gentry
sixty
years
before
the
director
returned
the
salutation
with
much
politeness
this
was
really
a
pleasant
incident
and
he
took
a
silver
half
dollar
from
his
pocket
and
gave
it
to
the
little
girl
before
he
went
on
kape
it
safe
darlin
said
the
old
woman
you
need
it
yet
do
be
spending
all
your
money
in
sweeties
is
a
very
cold
world
to
them
that
haves
no
pince
in
their
pocket
the
child
looked
up
at
kilpatrick
apprehensively
then
the
sunshine
of
hope
broke
out
again
through
the
cloud
i
am
going
to
save
fine
till
i
buy
a
house
and
you
and
me
live
there
together
kilpatrick
and
have
a
lovely
coal
fire
all
the
time
faix
maggie
i
have
always
thought
some
day
i
kape
a
pig
and
live
pritty
in
me
own
house
said
kilpatrick
but
i
the
old
sweeper
yet
in
number
two
is
a
worrld
where
some
has
and
more
wants
she
added
with
a
sigh
i
got
the
manes
for
a
good
buryin
the
lord
be
praised
and
a
bitteen
more
beside
i
would
have
that
if
father
daley
was
as
croping
as
some
mis
mullin
does
always
be
scolding
father
daley
having
all
the
collections
ventured
maggie
somewhat
adrift
in
so
great
a
subject
she
no
right
then
exclaimed
the
old
woman
angrily
she
get
no
luck
to
be
grudging
her
pince
that
way
is
hard
work
anny
priest
would
have
to
kape
the
likes
of
hersilf
from
being
haythens
altogether
there
was
a
nine
per
cent
annual
dividend
declared
at
the
meeting
the
next
week
with
considerable
applause
from
the
board
and
sincere
congratulations
to
the
agent
he
looked
thinner
and
more
sober
than
usual
and
several
persons
present
whose
aid
he
had
asked
in
private
knew
very
well
the
reason
after
the
meeting
was
over
the
senior
director
and
largest
stockholder
shook
hands
with
him
warmly
about
that
matter
you
suggested
to
me
the
other
day
he
said
and
the
agent
looked
up
eagerly
i
consulted
several
of
our
board
in
regard
to
the
propriety
of
it
before
we
came
down
but
they
all
agreed
with
me
that
it
was
no
use
to
cross
a
bridge
until
you
come
to
it
times
look
a
little
better
and
the
operatives
will
share
in
the
accession
of
credit
to
a
mill
that
declares
nine
per
cent
this
year
i
hope
that
we
shall
be
able
to
run
the
mills
with
at
worst
only
a
moderate
and
they
may
think
themselves
very
fortunate
when
so
many
hands
are
being
turned
off
everywhere
the
agent
face
grew
dark
i
hope
that
times
will
take
a
better
turn
he
managed
to
say
yes
yes
answered
the
director
to
you
mr
agent
i
am
not
sure
of
seeing
you
again
for
some
time
he
added
with
unusual
kindliness
i
am
an
old
man
now
to
be
hurrying
round
to
board
meetings
and
having
anything
to
do
with
responsibilities
like
these
my
sons
must
take
their
turn
there
was
an
eager
protest
from
the
listeners
and
presently
the
busy
group
of
men
disappeared
on
their
way
to
the
train
a
nine
per
cent
dividend
naturally
made
the
farley
manufacturing
company
stock
go
up
a
good
many
points
and
word
came
presently
that
the
largest
stockholder
and
one
or
two
other
men
had
sold
out
then
the
stock
ceased
to
rise
and
winter
came
on
apace
and
the
hard
times
which
the
agent
had
foreseen
came
also
iii
one
noon
in
early
march
there
were
groups
of
men
and
women
gathering
in
the
farley
streets
for
a
wonder
nobody
was
hurrying
toward
home
and
dinner
was
growing
cold
on
some
of
the
long
tables
they
might
have
carried
us
through
the
cold
weather
there
but
a
month
more
of
it
said
one
man
sorrowfully
they
be
talking
to
us
about
economy
now
some
o
them
big
thinkers
they
say
we
ought
to
learn
how
to
save
they
always
begin
about
that
quick
as
the
work
stops
said
a
youngish
woman
angrily
she
was
better
dressed
than
most
of
the
group
about
her
and
had
the
keen
impatient
look
of
a
leader
they
say
that
manufacturing
is
going
to
the
dogs
and
capital
in
worse
distress
than
labor
how
is
it
those
big
railroads
get
along
they
ca
shut
down
there
none
o
them
stops
they
cut
down
sometimes
when
they
have
to
but
they
do
turn
off
their
help
this
way
complained
somebody
else
faith
then
they
do
know
what
justice
is
they
talk
about
their
justice
all
so
fine
said
a
young
irishman
justice
is
nine
per
cent
last
year
for
the
men
that
had
the
money
and
no
rise
at
all
for
the
men
that
did
the
work
they
say
the
going
to
last
all
summer
anyway
i
going
to
pack
my
kit
said
a
young
fellow
who
had
just
married
and
undertaken
with
unusual
pride
and
ambition
to
keep
house
the
likes
of
me
ca
be
idle
but
where
to
look
for
any
work
for
a
mule
spinner
the
lord
only
knows
even
the
french
were
sobered
for
once
and
talked
eagerly
among
themselves
halfway
down
the
street
in
front
of
the
french
grocery
a
man
was
haranguing
his
compatriots
from
the
top
of
a
everybody
was
anxious
and
excited
by
the
sudden
news
no
work
after
a
week
from
until
times
were
better
there
had
already
been
a
the
mills
had
not
been
earning
anything
all
winter
the
agent
had
hoped
to
keep
on
for
at
least
two
months
longer
and
then
to
make
some
scheme
about
running
at
half
time
in
the
summer
setting
aside
the
present
work
for
simple
he
knew
well
enough
that
the
large
families
were
scattered
through
the
mill
rooms
and
that
any
pay
would
be
a
help
some
of
the
young
men
could
be
put
to
other
work
for
the
company
there
was
a
huge
tract
of
woodland
farther
back
among
the
hills
where
some
timber
could
be
got
ready
for
shipping
his
mind
was
full
of
plans
and
anxieties
and
the
telegram
that
morning
struck
him
like
a
blow
he
had
asked
that
he
might
keep
the
prices
up
to
where
the
best
men
could
make
at
least
six
dollars
and
a
half
a
week
and
was
hoping
for
a
straight
answer
but
the
words
on
the
yellow
paper
seemed
to
dance
about
and
make
him
dizzy
shut
down
saturday
until
times
are
better
he
repeated
to
himself
shut
down
until
times
are
worse
here
in
farley
the
agent
stood
at
the
window
looking
out
at
the
piteous
defenseless
groups
that
passed
by
he
wished
bitterly
that
his
own
pay
stopped
with
the
rest
it
did
not
seem
fair
that
he
was
not
thrown
out
upon
the
world
too
i
do
know
what
they
going
to
do
they
shall
have
the
last
cent
i
saved
before
anybody
suffers
he
said
in
his
heart
but
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
when
he
saw
kilpatrick
go
limping
out
of
the
gate
she
waited
a
moment
for
her
constant
companion
poor
little
maggie
the
doffer
and
they
went
away
up
the
street
toward
their
poor
lodging
holding
each
other
fast
by
the
hand
maggie
father
and
grandfather
and
had
all
worked
in
the
farley
mills
they
had
left
no
heritage
but
work
behind
them
for
this
orphan
child
they
had
never
been
able
to
save
so
much
that
a
long
illness
a
prolonged
old
age
could
not
waste
their
slender
hoards
away
iv
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
an
outsider
to
understand
the
sudden
plunge
from
decent
comfort
to
actual
poverty
in
this
small
mill
town
strange
to
say
it
was
upon
the
smaller
families
that
the
strain
fell
the
worst
in
farley
and
upon
men
and
women
who
had
nobody
to
look
to
but
themselves
where
a
man
had
a
large
household
of
children
and
several
of
these
were
old
enough
to
be
at
work
and
to
put
aside
their
wages
or
pay
for
their
board
where
such
a
man
was
of
a
thrifty
and
saving
turn
and
a
ruler
of
his
household
like
old
james
dow
in
the
he
might
feel
sure
of
a
comfortable
hoard
and
be
fearless
of
a
rainy
day
but
with
a
young
man
who
worked
for
his
wife
and
a
little
flock
or
one
who
had
an
invalid
to
work
for
that
heaviest
of
burdens
to
the
poor
the
door
seemed
to
be
shut
and
barred
against
prosperity
and
life
became
a
test
of
one
power
of
endurance
the
agent
went
home
late
that
noon
from
the
the
street
was
nearly
empty
but
he
had
no
friendly
look
or
word
for
anyone
whom
he
passed
those
who
knew
him
well
only
pitied
him
but
it
seemed
to
the
tired
man
as
if
every
eye
must
look
at
him
with
reproach
the
long
mill
buildings
of
gray
stone
with
their
rows
of
windows
wore
a
repellent
look
of
strength
and
solidity
more
than
one
man
felt
bitterly
his
own
personal
weakness
as
he
turned
to
look
at
them
the
ocean
of
fate
seemed
to
be
dashing
him
against
their
gray
walls
what
use
was
it
to
fight
against
the
corporation
two
great
forces
were
in
opposition
now
and
happiness
could
come
only
from
their
serving
each
other
in
harmony
the
stronger
force
of
capital
had
withdrawn
from
the
league
the
weaker
one
labor
was
turned
into
an
utter
helplessness
of
idleness
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
you
can
not
rebel
against
a
you
can
only
submit
a
week
later
the
great
wheel
stopped
early
on
the
last
day
of
work
almost
everyone
left
his
special
charge
of
machinery
in
good
order
oiled
and
cleaned
and
slackened
with
a
kind
of
affectionate
lingering
care
for
one
person
loves
his
machine
as
another
loves
his
horse
even
little
maggie
pushed
her
into
a
safe
place
near
the
overseer
desk
and
tipped
it
up
and
dusted
it
out
with
a
handful
of
waste
at
the
foot
of
the
long
winding
stairs
kilpatrick
was
putting
away
her
broom
and
she
sighed
as
she
locked
the
closet
door
she
had
known
hard
times
before
they
be
wanting
me
with
odd
jobs
we
be
after
getting
along
some
way
she
said
with
satisfaction
march
is
a
long
month
so
it
is
there
be
plinty
time
for
change
before
the
ind
of
it
said
mary
cassidy
hopefully
the
agent
will
be
thinking
whatever
can
he
do
sure
he
very
ingenious
look
at
him
how
well
he
persuaded
the
directors
to
off
wit
making
cotton
cloth
like
everybody
else
and
catch
a
chance
wit
all
these
new
linings
and
things
he
done
very
well
too
there
bees
no
sinse
in
a
anny
way
the
looms
and
cards
all
suffers
and
the
bands
all
slacks
if
they
do
get
stiff
i
sooner
pay
folks
to
tind
their
work
whatever
it
cost
is
true
for
you
agreed
kilpatrick
what
ye
do
wit
the
shild
now
she
no
chance
of
pay
any
more
asked
mary
relentlessly
and
poor
maggie
eyes
grew
dark
with
fright
as
the
conversation
abruptly
pointed
her
way
she
sometimes
waked
up
in
misery
in
kilpatrick
warm
bed
crying
for
fear
that
she
was
going
to
be
sent
back
to
the
poorhouse
maggie
an
me
going
to
kape
together
awhile
yet
said
the
good
old
woman
fondly
she
very
handy
for
me
so
she
is
we
part
with
other
whativer
befalls
so
we
and
maggie
looked
up
with
a
wistful
smile
only
half
reassured
to
her
the
seemed
like
the
end
of
the
world
some
of
the
french
people
took
time
by
the
forelock
and
boarded
the
midnight
train
that
very
saturday
with
all
their
possessions
a
little
later
two
or
three
families
departed
by
the
same
train
under
cover
of
the
darkness
between
two
days
without
stopping
to
pay
even
their
house
rent
these
mysterious
flittings
like
that
of
the
famous
tartar
tribe
roused
a
suspicion
against
their
fellow
countrymen
but
after
a
succession
of
such
departures
almost
everybody
else
thought
it
far
cheaper
to
stay
among
friends
it
seemed
as
if
at
any
moment
the
great
mill
wheels
might
begin
to
turn
and
the
bell
begin
to
ring
but
day
after
day
the
little
town
was
still
and
the
bell
tolled
the
hours
one
after
another
as
if
it
were
sunday
the
mild
spring
weather
came
on
and
the
women
sat
mending
or
knitting
on
the
doorsteps
more
people
moved
away
there
were
but
few
men
and
girls
left
now
in
the
quiet
and
the
spare
tables
were
stacked
one
upon
another
at
the
end
of
the
rooms
when
came
word
was
passed
about
the
corporation
that
the
agent
was
going
to
portion
out
a
field
that
belonged
to
him
a
little
way
out
of
town
on
the
south
road
and
let
every
man
who
had
a
family
take
a
piece
to
plant
he
also
offered
seed
potatoes
and
garden
seeds
free
to
anyone
who
would
come
and
ask
for
them
at
his
house
the
poor
are
very
generous
to
each
other
as
a
rule
and
there
was
much
borrowing
and
lending
from
house
to
house
and
it
was
wonderful
how
long
the
people
seemed
to
continue
their
usual
fashions
of
life
without
distress
almost
everybody
had
saved
a
little
bit
of
money
and
some
had
saved
more
if
one
could
no
longer
buy
beefsteak
he
could
still
buy
flour
and
potatoes
and
a
bit
of
pork
lent
a
pleasing
flavor
to
content
an
idle
man
who
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
stroll
about
town
one
night
the
agent
was
sitting
alone
in
his
large
house
mary
moynahan
his
housekeeper
had
gone
up
to
the
church
there
was
a
timid
knock
at
the
door
there
were
two
persons
waiting
a
short
man
and
a
pale
woman
with
dark
bright
eyes
who
was
nearly
a
head
taller
than
her
companion
come
in
ellen
i
glad
to
see
you
said
the
agent
have
you
got
your
mike
almost
all
the
planters
of
the
field
had
come
under
cover
of
darkness
and
contrived
if
possible
to
avoid
each
other
is
the
potatoes
we
after
asking
sir
said
ellen
she
was
always
spokeswoman
for
mike
had
an
impediment
in
his
speech
the
childher
come
up
yisterday
and
got
them
while
you
be
down
at
the
was
mary
moynahan
saw
to
them
we
do
be
very
thankful
to
you
sir
for
your
kindness
come
in
said
the
agent
seeing
there
was
something
of
consequence
to
be
said
ellen
carroll
and
he
had
worked
side
by
side
many
a
long
day
when
they
were
young
she
had
been
a
noble
wife
to
mike
whose
poor
fortunes
she
had
gladly
shared
for
sake
of
his
good
heart
though
mike
now
and
then
paid
too
much
respect
to
his
often
infirmities
there
was
a
slight
flavor
of
whisky
now
on
the
evening
air
but
it
was
a
serious
thing
to
put
on
your
sunday
coat
and
go
up
with
your
wife
to
see
the
agent
we
come
wanting
to
talk
about
any
chances
there
might
be
with
the
mill
ventured
ellen
timidly
as
she
stood
in
the
lighted
room
then
she
looked
at
mike
for
reassurance
we
very
bad
off
you
see
she
went
on
yes
sir
i
got
them
potaties
but
i
had
to
bake
a
little
of
them
for
supper
and
more
again
the
day
for
our
breakfast
i
know
whatever
we
do
whin
they
gone
the
poor
children
does
be
entreating
me
for
them
dan
the
mother
eyes
were
full
of
tears
it
was
very
seldom
now
that
anybody
called
the
agent
by
his
christian
name
there
was
a
natural
reserve
and
dignity
about
him
and
there
had
come
a
definite
separation
between
him
and
most
of
his
old
friends
in
the
two
years
while
he
had
managed
to
go
to
the
school
of
technology
in
boston
why
did
you
let
me
know
it
was
bad
as
that
he
asked
i
mean
that
anybody
here
should
suffer
while
i
got
a
cent
the
folks
do
like
to
be
begging
sir
said
ellen
sorrowfully
but
there
lots
of
them
does
be
in
trouble
they
ought
to
go
away
when
the
mills
shut
down
but
for
nobody
knows
where
to
go
farley
ai
like
them
big
towns
where
a
man
pick
up
something
else
to
do
i
says
to
mike
mike
let
go
up
after
dark
and
tark
to
dan
he
help
us
out
if
he
can
says
i
sit
down
ellen
said
the
agent
kindly
as
the
poor
woman
began
to
cry
he
made
her
take
the
armchair
which
the
girls
had
given
him
at
christmas
two
years
before
she
sat
there
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
and
trying
to
keep
back
her
sobs
and
go
quietly
on
with
what
she
had
to
say
mike
was
sitting
across
the
room
with
his
back
to
the
wall
anxiously
twirling
his
hat
round
and
round
yis
we
very
bad
off
he
contrived
to
say
after
much
futile
stammering
all
the
folks
in
the
corporation
but
dow
has
got
great
bills
run
up
now
at
the
stores
and
thim
that
had
money
saved
has
lint
to
thim
that
had
be
long
enough
before
anybody
free
whin
the
mills
starts
up
we
have
to
spind
for
everything
at
once
the
children
is
very
hard
on
their
clothes
and
they
all
dropping
to
pieces
i
thought
i
have
everything
new
for
them
this
spring
they
do
be
growing
so
i
minds
them
and
patches
them
the
best
i
can
and
again
ellen
was
overcome
by
tears
mike
an
me
always
been
conthrivin
how
would
we
get
something
laid
up
so
if
anny
one
would
die
or
be
long
sick
we
be
equal
to
it
but
we
had
great
pride
to
see
the
little
gerrls
go
looking
as
well
as
anny
and
we
worked
very
steady
but
there
so
manny
of
us
we
had
to
pay
rint
for
a
large
tenement
and
we
only
seventeen
dollars
and
a
little
more
when
the
was
sure
the
likes
of
us
has
a
right
to
earn
more
than
our
living
ourselves
being
so
is
a
long
time
now
that
mike

steady
we
always
had
the
pride
to
hope

a
house

and
a
pieceen
o
land
but
i
thankful
now

as
well
for
us
we
no
chances
to
pay
taxes
now
mike
made
a
desperate
effort
to
speak
as
his
wife
faltered
and
began
to
cry
again
and
seeing
his
distress
forgot
her
own
and
supplied
the
halting
words
he
wants
to
know
if
there
army
work
he
could
get
some
place
else
than
farley
himself
been
sixteen
years
now
in
the
picker

he
was
one
of
six
and
now
he
is
one
of
the
four
since
you
got
the
new
machines
yourself
knows
it
well
the
agent
knew
about
mike
he
looked
compassionate
as
he
shook
his
head

where
you
are
for
a
while
at
any
rate

look
a
little
better

in
distress
you
all
stood
by
me
is
all
the
lazy
ones
be
coming
if
we
told
on
the
poor
boy
said
ellen
gratefully
as
they
hurried
home
ai
he
got
the
good
heart
we
ought
to
be
very
discrate
mike
and
mike
agreed
by
a
most
impatient
gesture
but
by
the
time
summer
had
begun
to
wane
the
agent
was
a
far
poorer
man
than
when
it
had
begun
mike
and
ellen
carroll
were
only
the
leaders
of
a
sorrowful
procession
that
sought
his
door
evening
after
evening
some
asked
for
help
who
might
have
done
without
it
but
others
were
saved
from
actual
want
there
were
a
few
men
who
got
work
among
the
farms
but
there
was
little
steady
work
the
agent
made
the
most
of
odd
jobs
about
the
mill
yards
and
contrived
somehow
or
other
to
give
almost
every
household
a
lift
the
village
looked
more
and
more
dull
and
forlorn
but
in
august
when
a
traveling
show
ventured
to
give
a
performance
in
farley
the
corporation
hall
was
filled
as
it
seldom
was
filled
in
prosperous
times
this
made
the
agent
wonder
until
he
followed
the
crowd
of
workless
sadly
idle
men
and
women
into
the
place
of
entertainment
and
looked
at
them
with
a
sudden
comprehension
that
they
were
spending
their
last
cent
for
a
little
cheerfulness
vi
the
agent
was
going
into
the
one
day
when
he
met
old
father
daley
and
they
stopped
for
a
bit
of
friendly
talk
could
you
come
in
for
a
few
minutes
sir
asked
the
younger
man
there
nobody
in
the
the
busy
priest
looked
up
at
the
clock
in
the
mill
tower
i
can
he
said
is
not
so
late
as
i
thought
we
soon
be
having
the
mail
the
agent
led
the
way
and
brought
one
of
the
directors
comfortable
chairs
from
their
then
he
spun
his
own
chair
from
before
his
desk
and
they
sat
down
it
was
a
warm
day
in
the
middle
of
september
the
windows
were
wide
open
on
the
side
toward
the
river
and
there
was
a
flicker
of
light
on
the
ceiling
from
the
sunny
water
the
noise
of
the
fall
was
loud
and
incessant
in
the
room
somehow
one
never
noticed
it
very
much
when
the
mills
were
running
how
are
the
duffys
asked
the
agent
very
bad
answered
the
old
priest
gravely
the
doctor
sent
for
me
he
could
get
them
to
take
any
medicine
he
says
that
it
typhoid
only
a
low
fever
among
them
from
bad
food
and
want
of
care
that
tenement
is
very
old
and
bad
the
drains
from
the
upper
tenement
have
leaked
and
spoiled
the
whole
west
side
of
the
building
i
suppose
they
never
told
you
of
it
i
did
the
best
i
could
about
it
last
spring
said
the
agent
they
were
afraid
of
being
turned
out
and
they
hid
it
for
that
reason
the
company
allowed
me
something
for
repairs
as
usual
and
i
tried
to
get
more
you
see
i
spent
it
all
before
i
knew
what
a
summer
was
before
us
whatever
i
have
done
since
i
have
paid
for
except
what
they
call
legitimate
work
and
care
of
property
last
year
i
put
all
maple
street
into
order
and
meant
to
go
right
through
the
corporation
i
done
the
best
i
could
he
protested
with
a
bright
spot
of
color
in
his
cheeks
some
of
the
men
have
tinkered
up
their
tenements
and
i
have
counted
it
toward
the
rent
but
they
do
all
know
how
to
drive
a
nail
is
true
for
you
you
have
done
the
best
you
could
said
the
priest
heartily
and
both
the
men
were
silent
while
the
river
which
was
older
than
they
and
had
seen
a
whole
race
of
men
disappear
before
they
came
the
river
took
this
opportunity
to
speak
louder
than
ever
i
think
that
manufacturing
prospects
look
a
little
brighter
said
the
agent
wishing
to
be
cheerful
there
are
some
good
orders
out
but
of
course
the
buyers
can
take
advantage
of
our
condition
the
treasurer
writes
me
that
we
must
be
firm
about
not
starting
up
until
we
are
sure
of
business
on
a
good
paying
margin
like
last
year
asked
the
priest
who
was
resting
himself
in
the
armchair
there
was
a
friendly
twinkle
in
his
eyes
like
last
year
answered
the
agent
i
worked
like
two
men
and
i
pushed
the
mills
hard
to
make
that
large
profit
i
saw
there
was
trouble
coming
and
i
told
the
directors
and
asked
for
a
special
surplus
but
i
had
no
idea
of
anything
like
this
nine
per
cent
in
these
times
was
too
good
a
prize
said
father
daley
but
the
twinkle
in
his
eyes
had
suddenly
disappeared
you
wo
get
your
new
church
for
a
long
time
yet
said
the
agent
no
no
said
the
old
man
impatiently
i
have
kept
the
foundations
going
as
well
as
i
could
and
the
talk
for
their
own
sakes
it
gives
them
something
to
think
about
i
took
the
money
they
gave
me
in
collections
and
let
them
have
it
back
again
for
work
is
well
to
lead
their
minds
and
he
gave
a
quick
glance
at
the
agent
is
no
pride
of
mine
for
and
no
good
credit
with
the
bishop
i
after
young
men
can
be
satisfied
with
those
things
not
an
old
priest
like
me
that
prays
to
be
a
father
to
his
people
father
daley
spoke
as
man
speaks
to
man
straight
out
of
an
honest
heart
i
see
many
things
now
that
i
used
to
be
blind
about
long
ago
he
said
you
may
take
a
man
who
comes
over
him
and
his
wife
they
fall
upon
good
wages
and
their
heads
are
turned
with
joy
they
been
hungry
for
generations
back
and
they
always
seen
those
above
them
who
dressed
fine
and
lived
soft
and
they
want
a
taste
of
luxury
too
they
bound
to
satisfy
themselves
so
they
spend
and
spend
and
have
beefsteak
for
dinner
every
day
just
because
they
never
had
enough
before
but
they
turn
into
wild
beasts
of
selfishness
most
of
if
they
had
no
check
is
there
the
church
steps
in
your
maker
and
do
him
honor
in
his
house
of
prayer
says
she
be
thinking
of
eternity
and
of
what
sure
to
come
and
you
will
join
with
me
in
believing
that
it
never
those
who
have
given
most
to
the
church
who
come
first
to
the
ground
in
a
hard
time
like
this
show
me
a
good
church
and
i
show
you
a
thrifty
people
father
daley
looked
eagerly
at
the
agent
for
sympathy
you
speak
the
truth
sir
said
the
agent
those
that
give
most
are
always
the
last
to
hold
out
with
honest
independence
and
the
first
to
do
for
others
some
priests
may
have
plundered
their
parishes
for
pride
sake
there
no
saying
what
is
in
poor
human
nature
repeated
father
daley
earnestly
god
forgive
us
all
for
unprofitable
servants
of
him
and
his
church
i
believe
in
saying
more
about
prayer
and
right
living
and
less
about
collections
in
god
house
but
it
the
giving
hand
that
the
rich
hand
all
the
world
over
i
do
think
ireland
has
ever
sent
us
over
many
misers
saint
patrick
must
have
banished
them
all
with
the
snakes
suggested
the
agent
with
a
grim
smile
the
priest
shook
his
head
and
laughed
a
little
and
then
both
men
were
silent
again
in
the
the
mail
train
whistled
noisily
up
the
road
and
came
into
the
station
at
the
end
of
the
empty
street
then
it
rang
its
loud
bell
and
puffed
and
whistled
away
again
i
bring
your
mail
over
sir
said
the
agent
presently
sit
here
and
rest
yourself
until
i
come
back
and
we
walk
home
together
the
leather
looked
thin
and
flat
and
the
leisurely
postmaster
had
nearly
distributed
its
contents
by
the
time
the
agent
had
crossed
the
street
and
reached
the
office
his
clerks
were
both
off
on
a
long
holiday
they
were
brothers
and
were
glad
of
the
chance
to
take
their
vacations
together
they
had
been
on
lower
pay
there
was
little
to
do
in
the
hardly
anybody
time
to
keep
or
even
a
letter
to
write
two
or
three
loiterers
stopped
the
agent
to
ask
him
the
usual
question
if
there
were
any
signs
of
starting
up
an
old
farmer
who
sat
in
his
long
wagon
before
the
asked
for
news
too
and
touched
his
hat
with
an
awkward
sort
of
military
salute
come
out
to
our
place
and
stop
a
few
days
he
said
kindly
you
look
kind
of
pinched
up
and
bleached
out
mr
agent
you
ca
be
needed
much
here
i
wish
i
could
come
said
the
agent
stopping
again
and
looking
up
at
the
old
man
with
a
boyish
expectant
face
nobody
had
happened
to
think
about
him
in
just
that
way
and
he
was
far
from
thinking
about
himself
i
got
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
people
that
are
left
here
you
see
they
had
a
pretty
hard
summer
not
so
hard
as
you
have
said
the
old
man
as
the
agent
went
along
the
street
you
never
had
a
day
of
rest
more
than
once
or
twice
since
you
were
born
there
were
two
letters
and
a
pamphlet
for
father
daley
and
a
thin
handful
of
circulars
for
the
company
in
busy
times
there
was
often
all
the
mail
matter
that
a
clerk
could
bring
the
agent
sat
down
at
his
desk
in
the
and
the
priest
opened
a
thick
foreign
letter
with
evident
pleasure
is
from
an
old
friend
of
mine
in
a
monastery
in
france
he
said
i
only
hear
from
him
once
a
year
and
father
daley
settled
himself
in
his
armchair
to
read
the
pages
as
for
the
agent
of
the
mills
he
had
quickly
opened
a
letter
from
the
treasurer
and
was
not
listening
to
anything
that
was
said
suddenly
he
whirled
round
in
his
desk
chair
and
held
out
the
letter
to
the
priest
his
hand
shook
and
his
face
was
as
pale
as
ashes
what
is
it
what
the
matter
cried
the
startled
old
man
who
had
hardly
followed
the
first
pious
salutations
of
his
own
letter
to
their
end
read
it
to
me
yourself
dan
is
there
any
trouble
orders
i
got
orders
to
start
up
we
going
to
start
i
wrote
them
last
week
but
the
agent
had
to
spring
up
from
his
chair
and
go
to
the
window
next
the
river
before
he
could
steady
his
voice
to
speak
he
thought
it
was
the
look
of
the
moving
water
that
made
him
dizzy
we
going
to
start
up
the
mills
as
soon
as
i
can
get
things
ready
he
turned
to
look
up
at
the
thermometer
as
if
it
were
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
then
the
color
rushed
to
his
face
and
he
leaned
a
moment
against
the
wall
thank
god
said
the
old
priest
devoutly
here
come
and
sit
down
my
boy
faith
but
it
good
news
and
i
the
first
to
get
it
from
you
they
shook
hands
and
were
cheerful
together
the
foreign
letter
was
crammed
into
father
daley
pocket
and
he
reached
for
his
big
cane
tell
everybody
as
you
go
up
the
street
sir
said
dan
i
got
a
hurricane
of
things
to
see
to
i
must
go
the
other
way
down
to
the
storehouses
tell
them
to
pass
the
good
news
about
town
as
fast
as
they
can
hearten
up
the
women
all
the
anxious
look
had
gone
as
if
by
magic
from
the
agent
face
two
weeks
from
that
time
the
old
mill
bell
stopped
tolling
for
the
slow
hours
of
idleness
and
rang
out
loud
and
clear
for
the
housekeepers
to
get
up
and
rang
for
breakfast
and
later
still
for
all
the
people
to
go
in
to
work
some
of
the
old
hands
were
gone
for
good
and
new
ones
must
be
broken
in
in
their
places
but
there
were
many
familiar
faces
to
pass
the
windows
into
the
mill
yard
there
were
french
families
which
had
reappeared
with
surprising
promptness
michel
and
his
pretty
daughter
were
there
and
a
household
of
cousins
who
had
come
to
the
next
tenement
the
agent
stood
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
nodded
soberly
to
one
group
after
another
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
never
felt
so
happy
in
his
life
set
this
morning
said
one
of
the
clerks
whose
desk
was
close
beside
the
window
he
was
a
son
of
one
of
the
directors
who
had
sent
him
to
the
agent
to
learn
something
about
manufacturing
they
had
a
bitter
hard
summer
that
you
know
nothing
about
said
the
agent
slowly
just
then
kilpatrick
and
old
mary
cassidy
came
along
and
little
maggie
was
with
them
she
had
got
back
her
old
chance
at
doffing
and
the
hard
times
were
over
they
all
smiled
with
such
blissful
satisfaction
that
the
agent
smiled
too
and
even
waved
his
hand
