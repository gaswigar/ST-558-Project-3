coleridge
foreword
we
also
have
a
religion
which
was
given
to
our
forefathers
and
has
been
handed
down
to
us
their
children
it
teaches
us
to
be
thankful
to
be
united
and
to
love
one
another
we
never
quarrel
about
thus
spoke
the
great
seneca
orator
red
jacket
in
his
superb
reply
to
missionary
cram
more
than
a
century
ago
and
i
have
often
heard
the
same
thought
expressed
by
my
countrymen
i
have
attempted
to
paint
the
religious
life
of
the
typical
american
indian
as
it
was
before
he
knew
the
white
man
i
have
long
wished
to
do
this
because
i
can
not
find
that
it
has
ever
been
seriously
adequately
and
sincerely
done
the
religion
of
the
indian
is
the
last
thing
about
him
that
the
man
of
another
race
will
ever
understand
first
the
indian
does
not
speak
of
these
deep
matters
so
long
as
he
believes
in
them
and
when
he
has
ceased
to
believe
he
speaks
inaccurately
and
slightingly
second
even
if
he
can
be
induced
to
speak
the
racial
and
religious
prejudice
of
the
other
stands
in
the
way
of
his
sympathetic
comprehension
third
practically
all
existing
studies
on
this
subject
have
been
made
during
the
transition
period
when
the
original
beliefs
and
philosophy
of
the
native
american
were
already
undergoing
rapid
disintegration
there
are
to
be
found
here
and
there
superficial
accounts
of
strange
customs
and
ceremonies
of
which
the
symbolism
or
inner
meaning
was
largely
hidden
from
the
observer
and
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
material
collected
in
recent
years
which
is
without
value
because
it
is
modern
and
hybrid
inextricably
mixed
with
biblical
legend
and
caucasian
philosophy
some
of
it
has
even
been
invented
for
commercial
purposes
give
a
reservation
indian
a
present
and
he
will
possibly
provide
you
with
sacred
songs
a
mythology
and
to
order
my
little
book
does
not
pretend
to
be
a
scientific
treatise
it
is
as
true
as
i
can
make
it
to
my
childhood
teaching
and
ancestral
ideals
but
from
the
human
not
the
ethnological
standpoint
i
have
not
cared
to
pile
up
more
dry
bones
but
to
clothe
them
with
flesh
and
blood
so
much
as
has
been
written
by
strangers
of
our
ancient
faith
and
worship
treats
it
chiefly
as
matter
of
curiosity
i
should
like
to
emphasize
its
universal
quality
its
personal
appeal
the
first
missionaries
good
men
imbued
with
the
narrowness
of
their
age
branded
us
as
pagans
and
and
demanded
of
us
that
we
abjure
our
false
gods
before
bowing
the
knee
at
their
sacred
altar
they
even
told
us
that
we
were
eternally
lost
unless
we
adopted
a
tangible
symbol
and
professed
a
particular
form
of
their
faith
we
of
the
twentieth
century
know
better
we
know
that
all
religious
aspiration
all
sincere
worship
can
have
but
one
source
and
one
goal
we
know
that
the
god
of
the
lettered
and
the
unlettered
of
the
greek
and
the
barbarian
is
after
all
the
same
god
and
like
peter
we
perceive
that
he
is
no
respecter
of
persons
but
that
in
every
nation
he
that
feareth
him
and
worketh
righteousness
is
acceptable
to
him

of

the
original
attitude
of
the
american
indian
toward
the
eternal
the
great
mystery
that
surrounds
and
embraces
us
was
as
simple
as
it
was
exalted
to
him
it
was
the
supreme
conception
bringing
with
it
the
fullest
measure
of
joy
and
satisfaction
possible
in
this
life
the
worship
of
the
great
mystery
was
silent
solitary
free
from
all
it
was
silent
because
all
speech
is
of
necessity
feeble
and
imperfect
therefore
the
souls
of
my
ancestors
ascended
to
god
in
wordless
adoration
it
was
solitary
because
they
believed
that
he
is
nearer
to
us
in
solitude
and
there
were
no
priests
authorized
to
come
between
a
man
and
his
maker
none
might
exhort
or
confess
or
in
any
way
meddle
with
the
religious
experience
of
another
among
us
all
men
were
created
sons
of
god
and
stood
erect
as
conscious
of
their
divinity
our
faith
might
not
be
formulated
in
creeds
nor
forced
upon
any
who
were
unwilling
to
receive
it
hence
there
was
no
preaching
proselyting
nor
persecution
neither
were
there
any
scoffers
or
atheists
there
were
no
temples
or
shrines
among
us
save
those
of
nature
being
a
natural
man
the
indian
was
intensely
poetical
he
would
deem
it
sacrilege
to
build
a
house
for
him
who
may
be
met
face
to
face
in
the
mysterious
shadowy
aisles
of
the
primeval
forest
or
on
the
sunlit
bosom
of
virgin
prairies
upon
dizzy
spires
and
pinnacles
of
naked
rock
and
yonder
in
the
jeweled
vault
of
the
night
sky
he
who
enrobes
himself
in
filmy
veils
of
cloud
there
on
the
rim
of
the
visible
world
where
our
sun
kindles
his
evening
he
who
rides
upon
the
rigorous
wind
of
the
north
or
breathes
forth
his
spirit
upon
aromatic
southern
airs
whose
is
launched
upon
majestic
rivers
and
inland
seas
he
needs
no
lesser
cathedral
that
solitary
communion
with
the
unseen
which
was
the
highest
expression
of
our
religious
life
is
partly
described
in
the
word
bambeday
literally
mysterious
feeling
which
has
been
variously
translated
fasting
and
it
may
better
be
interpreted
as
consciousness
of
the
the
first
bambeday
or
religious
retreat
marked
an
epoch
in
the
life
of
the
youth
which
may
be
compared
to
that
of
confirmation
or
conversion
in
christian
experience
having
first
prepared
himself
by
means
of
the
purifying
and
cast
off
as
far
as
possible
all
human
or
fleshly
influences
the
young
man
sought
out
the
noblest
height
the
most
commanding
summit
in
all
the
surrounding
region
knowing
that
god
sets
no
value
upon
material
things
he
took
with
him
no
offerings
or
sacrifices
other
than
symbolic
objects
such
as
paints
and
tobacco
wishing
to
appear
before
him
in
all
humility
he
wore
no
clothing
save
his
moccasins
and
at
the
solemn
hour
of
sunrise
or
sunset
he
took
up
his
position
overlooking
the
glories
of
earth
and
facing
the
great
mystery
and
there
he
remained
naked
erect
silent
and
motionless
exposed
to
the
elements
and
forces
of
his
arming
for
a
night
and
a
day
to
two
days
and
nights
but
rarely
longer
sometimes
he
would
chant
a
hymn
without
words
or
offer
the
ceremonial
filled
in
this
holy
trance
or
ecstasy
the
indian
mystic
found
his
highest
happiness
and
the
motive
power
of
his
existence
when
he
returned
to
the
camp
he
must
remain
at
a
distance
until
he
had
again
entered
the
and
prepared
himself
for
intercourse
with
his
fellows
of
the
vision
or
sign
vouchsafed
to
him
he
did
not
speak
unless
it
had
included
some
commission
which
must
be
publicly
fulfilled
sometimes
an
old
man
standing
upon
the
brink
of
eternity
might
reveal
to
a
chosen
few
the
oracle
of
his
youth
the
native
american
has
been
generally
despised
by
his
white
conquerors
for
his
poverty
and
simplicity
they
forget
perhaps
that
his
religion
forbade
the
accumulation
of
wealth
and
the
enjoyment
of
luxury
to
him
as
to
other
men
in
every
age
and
race
from
diogenes
to
the
brothers
of
saint
francis
from
the
montanists
to
the
shakers
the
love
of
possessions
has
appeared
a
snare
and
the
burdens
of
a
complex
society
a
source
of
needless
peril
and
temptation
furthermore
it
was
the
rule
of
his
life
to
share
the
fruits
of
his
skill
and
success
with
his
less
fortunate
brothers
thus
he
kept
his
spirit
free
from
the
clog
of
pride
cupidity
or
envy
and
carried
out
as
he
believed
the
divine
decree
a
matter
profoundly
important
to
him
it
was
not
then
wholly
from
ignorance
or
improvidence
that
he
failed
to
establish
permanent
towns
and
to
develop
a
material
civilization
to
the
untutored
sage
the
concentration
of
population
was
the
prolific
mother
of
all
evils
moral
no
less
than
physical
he
argued
that
food
is
good
while
surfeit
kills
that
love
is
good
but
lust
destroys
and
not
less
dreaded
than
the
pestilence
following
upon
crowded
and
unsanitary
dwellings
was
the
loss
of
spiritual
power
inseparable
from
too
close
contact
with
one
s
all
who
have
lived
much
out
of
doors
know
that
there
is
a
magnetic
and
nervous
force
that
accumulates
in
solitude
and
that
is
quickly
dissipated
by
life
in
a
crowd
and
even
his
enemies
have
recognized
the
fact
that
for
a
certain
innate
power
and
wholly
independent
of
circumstances
the
american
indian
is
unsurpassed
among
men
the
red
man
divided
mind
into
two
parts
the
spiritual
mind
and
the
physical
mind
the
first
is
pure
spirit
concerned
only
with
the
essence
of
things
and
it
was
this
he
sought
to
strengthen
by
spiritual
prayer
during
which
the
body
is
subdued
by
fasting
and
hardship
in
this
type
of
prayer
there
was
no
beseeching
of
favor
or
help
all
matters
of
personal
or
selfish
concern
as
success
in
hunting
or
warfare
relief
from
sickness
or
the
sparing
of
a
beloved
life
were
definitely
relegated
to
the
plane
of
the
lower
or
material
mind
and
all
ceremonies
charms
or
incantations
designed
to
secure
a
benefit
or
to
avert
a
danger
were
recognized
as
emanating
from
the
physical
self
the
rites
of
this
physical
worship
again
were
wholly
symbolic
and
the
indian
no
more
worshiped
the
sun
than
the
christian
adores
the
cross
the
sun
and
the
earth
by
an
obvious
parable
holding
scarcely
more
of
poetic
metaphor
than
of
scientific
truth
were
in
his
view
the
parents
of
all
organic
life
from
the
sun
as
the
universal
father
proceeds
the
quickening
principle
in
nature
and
in
the
patient
and
fruitful
womb
of
our
mother
the
earth
are
hidden
embryos
of
plants
and
men
therefore
our
reverence
and
love
for
them
was
really
an
imaginative
extension
of
our
love
for
our
immediate
parents
and
with
this
sentiment
of
filial
piety
was
joined
a
willingness
to
appeal
to
them
as
to
a
father
for
such
good
gifts
as
we
may
desire
this
is
the
material
or
physical
prayer
the
elements
and
majestic
forces
in
nature
lightning
wind
water
fire
and
frost
were
regarded
with
awe
as
spiritual
powers
but
always
secondary
and
intermediate
in
character
we
believed
that
the
spirit
pervades
all
creation
and
that
every
creature
possesses
a
soul
in
some
degree
though
not
necessarily
a
soul
conscious
of
itself
the
tree
the
waterfall
the
grizzly
bear
each
is
an
embodied
force
and
as
such
an
object
of
reverence
the
indian
loved
to
come
into
sympathy
and
spiritual
communion
with
his
brothers
of
the
animal
kingdom
whose
inarticulate
souls
had
for
him
something
of
the
sinless
purity
that
we
attribute
to
the
innocent
and
irresponsible
child
he
had
faith
in
their
instincts
as
in
a
mysterious
wisdom
given
from
above
and
while
he
humbly
accepted
the
supposedly
voluntary
sacrifice
of
their
bodies
to
preserve
his
own
he
paid
homage
to
their
spirits
in
prescribed
prayers
and
offerings
in
every
religion
there
is
an
element
of
the
supernatural
varying
with
the
influence
of
pure
reason
over
its
devotees
the
indian
was
a
logical
and
clear
thinker
upon
matters
within
the
scope
of
his
understanding
but
he
had
not
yet
charted
the
vast
field
of
nature
or
expressed
her
wonders
in
terms
of
science
with
his
limited
knowledge
of
cause
and
effect
he
saw
miracles
on
every
hand
the
miracle
of
life
in
seed
and
egg
the
miracle
of
death
in
lightning
flash
and
in
the
swelling
deep
nothing
of
the
marvelous
could
astonish
him
as
that
a
beast
should
speak
or
the
sun
stand
still
the
virgin
birth
would
appear
scarcely
more
miraculous
than
is
the
birth
of
every
child
that
comes
into
the
world
or
the
miracle
of
the
loaves
and
fishes
excite
more
wonder
than
the
harvest
that
springs
from
a
single
ear
of
corn
who
may
condemn
his
superstition
surely
not
the
devout
catholic
or
even
protestant
missionary
who
teaches
bible
miracles
as
literal
fact
the
logical
man
must
either
deny
all
miracles
or
none
and
our
american
indian
myths
and
hero
stories
are
perhaps
in
themselves
quite
as
credible
as
those
of
the
hebrews
of
old
if
we
are
of
the
modern
type
of
mind
that
sees
in
natural
law
a
majesty
and
grandeur
far
more
impressive
than
any
solitary
infraction
of
it
could
possibly
be
let
us
not
forget
that
after
all
science
has
not
explained
everything
we
have
still
to
face
the
ultimate
miracle
the
origin
and
principle
of
life
here
is
the
supreme
mystery
that
is
the
essence
of
worship
without
which
there
can
be
no
religion
and
in
the
presence
of
this
mystery
our
attitude
can
not
be
very
unlike
that
of
the
natural
philosopher
who
beholds
with
awe
the
divine
in
all
creation
it
is
simple
truth
that
the
indian
did
not
so
long
as
his
native
philosophy
held
sway
over
his
mind
either
envy
or
desire
to
imitate
the
splendid
achievements
of
the
white
man
in
his
own
thought
he
rose
superior
to
them
he
scorned
them
even
as
a
lofty
spirit
absorbed
in
its
stern
task
rejects
the
soft
beds
the
luxurious
food
the
dalliance
of
a
rich
neighbor
it
was
clear
to
him
that
virtue
and
happiness
are
independent
of
these
things
if
not
incompatible
with
them
there
was
undoubtedly
much
in
primitive
christianity
to
appeal
to
this
man
and
jesus
hard
sayings
to
the
rich
and
about
the
rich
would
have
been
entirely
comprehensible
to
him
yet
the
religion
that
is
preached
in
our
churches
and
practiced
by
our
congregations
with
its
element
of
display
and
its
active
proselytism
and
its
open
contempt
of
all
religions
but
its
own
was
for
a
long
time
extremely
repellent
to
his
simple
mind
the
professionalism
of
the
pulpit
the
paid
exhorter
the
moneyed
church
was
an
unspiritual
and
unedifying
thing
and
it
was
not
until
his
spirit
was
broken
and
his
moral
and
physical
constitution
undermined
by
trade
conquest
and
strong
drink
that
christian
missionaries
obtained
any
real
hold
upon
him
strange
as
it
may
seem
it
is
true
that
the
proud
pagan
in
his
secret
soul
despised
the
good
men
who
came
to
convert
and
to
enlighten
him
nor
were
its
publicity
and
its
phariseeism
the
only
elements
in
the
alien
religion
that
offended
the
red
man
to
him
it
appeared
shocking
and
almost
incredible
that
there
were
among
this
people
who
claimed
superiority
many
irreligious
who
did
not
even
pretend
to
profess
the
national
faith
not
only
did
they
not
profess
it
but
they
stooped
so
low
as
to
insult
their
god
with
profane
and
sacrilegious
speech
in
our
own
tongue
his
name
was
not
spoken
aloud
even
with
utmost
reverence
much
less
lightly
or
irreverently
more
than
this
even
in
those
white
men
who
professed
religion
we
found
much
inconsistency
of
conduct
they
spoke
much
of
spiritual
things
while
seeking
only
the
material
they
bought
and
sold
everything
time
labor
personal
independence
the
love
of
woman
and
even
the
ministrations
of
their
holy
faith
the
lust
for
money
power
and
conquest
so
characteristic
of
the
race
did
not
escape
moral
condemnation
at
the
hands
of
his
untutored
judge
nor
did
he
fail
to
contrast
this
conspicuous
trait
of
the
dominant
race
with
the
spirit
of
the
meek
and
lowly
jesus
he
might
in
time
come
to
recognize
that
the
drunkards
and
licentious
among
white
men
with
whom
he
too
frequently
came
in
contact
were
condemned
by
the
white
man
s
religion
as
well
and
must
not
be
held
to
discredit
it
but
it
was
not
so
easy
to
overlook
or
to
excuse
national
bad
faith
when
distinguished
emissaries
from
the
father
at
washington
some
of
them
ministers
of
the
gospel
and
even
bishops
came
to
the
indian
nations
and
pledged
to
them
in
solemn
treaty
the
national
honor
with
prayer
and
mention
of
their
god
and
when
such
treaties
so
made
were
promptly
and
shamelessly
broken
is
it
strange
that
the
action
should
arouse
not
only
anger
but
contempt
the
historians
of
the
white
race
admit
that
the
indian
was
never
the
first
to
repudiate
his
oath
it
is
my
personal
belief
after
years
experience
of
it
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
christian
i
believe
that
christianity
and
modern
civilization
are
opposed
and
irreconcilable
and
that
the
spirit
of
christianity
and
of
our
ancient
religion
is
essentially
the
same
ii

and

the
american
indian
was
an
individualist
in
religion
as
in
war
he
had
neither
a
national
army
nor
an
organized
church
there
was
no
priest
to
assume
responsibility
for
another
s
soul
that
is
we
believed
the
supreme
duty
of
the
parent
who
only
was
permitted
to
claim
in
some
degree
the
priestly
office
and
function
since
it
is
his
creative
and
protecting
power
which
alone
approaches
the
solemn
function
of
deity
the
indian
was
a
religious
man
from
his
mother
s
womb
from
the
moment
of
her
recognition
of
the
fact
of
conception
to
the
end
of
the
second
year
of
life
which
was
the
ordinary
duration
of
lactation
it
was
supposed
by
us
that
the
mother
s
spiritual
influence
counted
for
most
her
attitude
and
secret
meditations
must
be
such
as
to
instill
into
the
receptive
soul
of
the
unborn
child
the
love
of
the
great
mystery
and
a
sense
of
brotherhood
with
all
creation
silence
and
isolation
are
the
rule
of
life
for
the
expectant
mother
she
wanders
prayerful
in
the
stillness
of
great
woods
or
on
the
bosom
of
the
untrodden
prairie
and
to
her
poetic
mind
the
immanent
birth
of
her
child
prefigures
the
advent
of
a
a
hero
or
the
mother
of
heroes
a
thought
conceived
in
the
virgin
breast
of
primeval
nature
and
dreamed
out
in
a
hush
that
is
only
broken
by
the
sighing
of
the
pine
tree
or
the
thrilling
orchestra
of
a
distant
waterfall
and
when
the
day
of
days
in
her
life
dawns
the
day
in
which
there
is
to
be
a
new
life
the
miracle
of
whose
making
has
been
intrusted
to
her
she
seeks
no
human
aid
she
has
been
trained
and
prepared
in
body
and
mind
for
this
her
holiest
duty
ever
since
she
can
remember
the
ordeal
is
best
met
alone
where
no
curious
or
pitying
eyes
embarrass
her
where
all
nature
says
to
her
spirit
tis
love
tis
love
the
fulfilling
of
life
when
a
sacred
voice
comes
to
her
out
of
the
silence
and
a
pair
of
eyes
open
upon
her
in
the
wilderness
she
knows
with
joy
that
she
has
borne
well
her
part
in
the
great
song
of
creation
presently
she
returns
to
the
camp
carrying
the
mysterious
the
holy
the
dearest
bundle
she
feels
the
endearing
warmth
of
it
and
hears
its
soft
breathing
it
is
still
a
part
of
herself
since
both
are
nourished
by
the
same
mouthful
and
no
look
of
a
lover
could
be
sweeter
than
its
deep
trusting
gaze
she
continues
her
spiritual
teaching
at
first
silently
a
mere
pointing
of
the
index
finger
to
nature
then
in
whispered
songs
at
morning
and
evening
to
her
and
to
the
child
the
birds
are
real
people
who
live
very
close
to
the
great
mystery
the
murmuring
trees
breathe
his
presence
the
falling
waters
chant
his
praise
if
the
child
should
chance
to
be
fretful
the
mother
raises
her
hand
hush
hush
she
cautions
it
tenderly
the
spirits
may
be
disturbed
she
bids
it
be
still
and
listen
listen
to
the
silver
voice
of
the
aspen
or
the
clashing
cymbals
of
the
birch
and
at
night
she
points
to
the
heavenly
blazed
trail
through
nature
s
galaxy
of
splendor
to
nature
s
god
silence
love
reverence
this
is
the
trinity
of
first
lessons
and
to
these
she
later
adds
generosity
courage
and
chastity
in
the
old
days
our
mothers
were
to
the
trust
imposed
upon
them
and
as
a
noted
chief
of
our
people
was
wont
to
say
men
may
slay
one
another
but
they
can
never
overcome
the
woman
for
in
the
quietude
of
her
lap
lies
the
child
you
may
destroy
him
once
and
again
but
he
issues
as
often
from
that
same
gentle
lap
a
gift
of
the
great
good
to
the
race
in
which
man
is
only
an
accomplice
this
wild
mother
has
not
only
the
experience
of
her
mother
and
grandmother
and
the
accepted
rules
of
her
people
for
a
guide
but
she
humbly
seeks
to
learn
a
lesson
from
ants
bees
spiders
beavers
and
badgers
she
studies
the
family
life
of
the
birds
so
exquisite
in
its
emotional
intensity
and
its
patient
devotion
until
she
seems
to
feel
the
universal
beating
in
her
own
breast
in
due
time
the
child
takes
of
his
own
accord
the
attitude
of
prayer
and
speaks
reverently
of
the
powers
he
thinks
that
he
is
a
blood
brother
to
all
living
creatures
and
the
storm
wind
is
to
him
a
messenger
of
the
great
at
the
age
of
about
eight
years
if
he
is
a
boy
she
turns
him
over
to
his
father
for
more
spartan
training
if
a
girl
she
is
from
this
time
much
under
the
guardianship
of
her
grandmother
who
is
considered
the
most
dignified
protector
for
the
maiden
indeed
the
distinctive
work
of
both
grandparents
is
that
of
acquainting
the
youth
with
the
national
traditions
and
beliefs
it
is
reserved
for
them
to
repeat
the
tales
with
dignity
and
authority
so
as
to
lead
him
into
his
inheritance
in
the
wisdom
and
experience
of
the
race
the
old
are
dedicated
to
the
service
of
the
young
as
their
teachers
and
advisers
and
the
young
in
turn
regard
them
with
love
and
reverence
our
old
age
was
in
some
respects
the
happiest
period
of
life
advancing
years
brought
with
them
much
freedom
not
only
from
the
burden
of
laborious
and
dangerous
tasks
but
from
those
restrictions
of
custom
and
etiquette
which
were
religiously
observed
by
all
others
no
one
who
is
at
all
acquainted
with
the
indian
in
his
home
can
deny
that
we
are
a
polite
people
as
a
rule
the
warrior
who
inspired
the
greatest
terror
in
the
hearts
of
his
enemies
was
a
man
of
the
most
exemplary
gentleness
and
almost
feminine
refinement
among
his
family
and
friends
a
soft
low
voice
was
considered
an
excellent
thing
in
man
as
well
as
in
woman
indeed
the
enforced
intimacy
of
tent
life
would
soon
become
intolerable
were
it
not
for
these
instinctive
reserves
and
delicacies
this
unfailing
respect
for
the
established
place
and
possessions
of
every
other
member
of
the
family
circle
this
habitual
quiet
order
and
decorum
our
people
though
capable
of
strong
and
durable
feeling
were
not
demonstrative
in
their
affection
at
any
time
least
of
all
in
the
presence
of
guests
or
strangers
only
to
the
aged
who
have
journeyed
far
and
are
in
a
manner
exempt
from
ordinary
rules
are
permitted
some
playful
familiarities
with
children
and
grandchildren
some
plain
speaking
even
to
harshness
and
objurgation
from
which
the
others
must
rigidly
refrain
in
short
the
old
men
and
women
are
privileged
to
say
what
they
please
and
how
they
please
without
contradiction
while
the
hardships
and
bodily
infirmities
that
of
necessity
fall
to
their
lot
are
softened
so
far
as
may
be
by
universal
consideration
and
attention
there
was
no
religious
ceremony
connected
with
marriage
among
us
while
on
the
other
hand
the
relation
between
man
and
woman
was
regarded
as
in
itself
mysterious
and
holy
it
appears
that
where
marriage
is
solemnized
by
the
church
and
blessed
by
the
priest
it
may
at
the
same
time
be
surrounded
with
customs
and
ideas
of
a
frivolous
superficial
and
even
prurient
character
we
believed
that
two
who
love
should
be
united
in
secret
before
the
public
acknowledgment
of
their
union
and
should
taste
their
apotheosis
alone
with
nature
the
betrothal
might
or
might
not
be
discussed
and
approved
by
the
parents
but
in
either
case
it
was
customary
for
the
young
pair
to
disappear
into
the
wilderness
there
to
pass
some
days
or
weeks
in
perfect
seclusion
and
dual
solitude
afterward
returning
to
the
village
as
man
and
wife
an
exchange
of
presents
and
entertainments
between
the
two
families
usually
followed
but
the
nuptial
blessing
was
given
by
the
high
priest
of
god
the
most
reverend
and
holy
nature
the
family
was
not
only
the
social
unit
but
also
the
unit
of
government
the
clan
is
nothing
more
than
a
larger
family
with
its
patriarchal
chief
as
the
natural
head
and
the
union
of
several
clans
by
intermarriage
and
voluntary
connection
constitutes
the
tribe
the
very
name
of
our
tribe
dakota
means
allied
people
the
remoter
degrees
of
kinship
were
fully
recognized
and
that
not
as
a
matter
of
form
only
first
cousins
were
known
as
brothers
and
sisters
the
name
of
cousin
constituted
a
binding
claim
and
our
rigid
morality
forbade
marriage
between
cousins
in
any
known
degree
or
in
other
words
within
the
clan
the
household
proper
consisted
of
a
man
with
one
or
more
wives
and
their
children
all
of
whom
dwelt
amicably
together
often
under
one
roof
although
some
men
of
rank
and
position
provided
a
separate
lodge
for
each
wife
there
were
indeed
few
plural
marriages
except
among
the
older
and
leading
men
and
plural
wives
were
usually
though
not
necessarily
sisters
a
marriage
might
honorably
be
dissolved
for
cause
but
there
was
very
little
infidelity
or
immorality
either
open
or
secret
it
has
been
said
that
the
position
of
woman
is
the
test
of
civilization
and
that
of
our
women
was
secure
in
them
was
vested
our
standard
of
morals
and
the
purity
of
our
blood
the
wife
did
not
take
the
name
of
her
husband
nor
enter
his
clan
and
the
children
belonged
to
the
clan
of
the
mother
all
of
the
family
property
was
held
by
her
descent
was
traced
in
the
maternal
line
and
the
honor
of
the
house
was
in
her
hands
modesty
was
her
chief
adornment
hence
the
younger
women
were
usually
silent
and
retiring
but
a
woman
who
had
attained
to
ripeness
of
years
and
wisdom
or
who
had
displayed
notable
courage
in
some
emergency
was
sometimes
invited
to
a
seat
in
the
council
thus
she
ruled
undisputed
within
her
own
domain
and
was
to
us
a
tower
of
moral
and
spiritual
strength
until
the
coming
of
the
border
white
man
the
soldier
and
trader
who
with
strong
drink
overthrew
the
honor
of
the
man
and
through
his
power
over
a
worthless
husband
purchased
the
virtue
of
his
wife
or
his
daughter
when
she
fell
the
whole
race
fell
with
her
before
this
calamity
came
upon
us
you
could
not
find
anywhere
a
happier
home
than
that
created
by
the
indian
woman
there
was
nothing
of
the
artificial
about
her
person
and
very
little
disingenuousness
in
her
character
her
early
and
consistent
training
the
definiteness
of
her
vocation
and
above
all
her
profoundly
religious
attitude
gave
her
a
strength
and
poise
that
could
not
be
overcome
by
any
ordinary
misfortune
indian
names
were
either
characteristic
nicknames
given
in
a
playful
spirit
deed
names
birth
names
or
such
as
have
a
religious
and
symbolic
meaning
it
has
been
said
that
when
a
child
is
born
some
accident
or
unusual
appearance
determines
his
name
this
is
sometimes
the
case
but
is
not
the
rule
a
man
of
forcible
character
with
a
fine
war
record
usually
bears
the
name
of
the
buffalo
or
bear
lightning
or
some
dread
natural
force
another
of
more
peaceful
nature
may
be
called
swift
bird
or
blue
sky
a
woman
s
name
usually
suggested
something
about
the
home
often
with
the
adjective
pretty
or
good
and
a
feminine
termination
names
of
any
dignity
or
importance
must
be
conferred
by
the
old
men
and
especially
so
if
they
have
any
spiritual
significance
as
sacred
cloud
mysterious
night
spirit
woman
and
the
like
such
a
name
was
sometimes
borne
by
three
generations
but
each
individual
must
prove
that
he
is
worthy
of
it
in
the
life
of
the
indian
there
was
only
one
inevitable
duty
the
duty
of
prayer
the
daily
recognition
of
the
unseen
and
eternal
his
daily
devotions
were
more
necessary
to
him
than
daily
food
he
wakes
at
daybreak
puts
on
his
moccasins
and
steps
down
to
the
water
s
edge
here
he
throws
handfuls
of
clear
cold
water
into
his
face
or
plunges
in
bodily
after
the
bath
he
stands
erect
before
the
advancing
dawn
facing
the
sun
as
it
dances
upon
the
horizon
and
offers
his
unspoken
orison
his
mate
may
precede
or
follow
him
in
his
devotions
but
never
accompanies
him
each
soul
must
meet
the
morning
sun
the
new
sweet
earth
and
the
great
silence
alone
whenever
in
the
course
of
the
daily
hunt
the
red
hunter
comes
upon
a
scene
that
is
strikingly
beautiful
or
sublime
a
black
thundercloud
with
the
rainbow
s
glowing
arch
above
the
mountain
a
white
waterfall
in
the
heart
of
a
green
gorge
a
vast
prairie
tinged
with
the
of
sunset
he
pauses
for
an
instant
in
the
attitude
of
worship
he
sees
no
need
for
setting
apart
one
day
in
seven
as
a
holy
day
since
to
him
all
days
are
god
s
every
act
of
his
life
is
in
a
very
real
sense
a
religious
act
he
recognizes
the
spirit
in
all
creation
and
believes
that
he
draws
from
it
spiritual
power
his
respect
for
the
immortal
part
of
the
animal
his
brother
often
leads
him
so
far
as
to
lay
out
the
body
of
his
game
in
state
and
decorate
the
head
with
symbolic
paint
or
feathers
then
he
stands
before
it
in
the
prayer
attitude
holding
up
the
filled
pipe
in
token
that
he
has
freed
with
honor
the
spirit
of
his
brother
whose
body
his
need
compelled
him
to
take
to
sustain
his
own
life
when
food
is
taken
the
woman
murmurs
a
grace
as
she
lowers
the
kettle
an
act
so
softly
and
unobtrusively
performed
that
one
who
does
not
know
the
custom
usually
fails
to
catch
the
whisper
spirit
partake
as
her
husband
receives
the
bowl
or
plate
he
likewise
murmurs
his
invocation
to
the
spirit
when
he
becomes
an
old
man
he
loves
to
make
a
notable
effort
to
prove
his
gratitude
he
cuts
off
the
choicest
morsel
of
the
meat
and
casts
it
into
the
fire
the
purest
and
most
ethereal
element
the
hospitality
of
the
wigwam
is
only
limited
by
the
institution
of
war
yet
if
an
enemy
should
honor
us
with
a
call
his
trust
will
not
be
misplaced
and
he
will
go
away
convinced
that
he
has
met
with
a
royal
host
our
honor
is
the
guarantee
for
his
safety
so
long
as
he
is
within
the
camp
friendship
is
held
to
be
the
severest
test
of
character
it
is
easy
we
think
to
be
loyal
to
family
and

are
few
and
in
large
part
of
modern
origin
belonging
properly
to
the
transition
that
period
must
be
held
to
begin
with
the
first
insidious
effect
upon
their
manners
and
customs
of
contact
with
the
dominant
race
and
many
of
the
tribes
were
so
influenced
long
before
they
ceased
to
lead
the
nomadic
life
the
the
black
robe
priests
the
military
and
finally
the
protestant
missionaries
were
the
men
who
began
the
disintegration
of
the
indian
nations
and
the
overthrow
of
their
religion
to
a
hundred
years
before
they
were
forced
to
enter
upon
reservation
life
we
have
no
authentic
study
of
them
until
well
along
in
the
transition
period
when
whiskey
and
trade
had
already
debauched
their
native
ideals
during
the
era
of
reconstruction
they
modified
their
customs
and
beliefs
continually
creating
a
singular
admixture
of
christian
with
pagan
superstitions
and
an
addition
to
the
old
of
disguised
bible
stories
under
an
indian
aspect
even
their
music
shows
the
influence
of
the
catholic
chants
most
of
the
material
collected
by
modern
observers
is
necessarily
of
this
promiscuous
character
it
is
noteworthy
that
the
first
effect
of
contact
with
the
whites
was
an
increase
of
cruelty
and
barbarity
an
intensifying
of
the
dark
shadows
in
the
picture
in
this
manner
the
sun
dance
of
the
plains
indians
the
most
important
of
their
public
ceremonials
was
abused
and
perverted
until
it
became
a
horrible
exhibition
of
barbarism
and
was
eventually
prohibited
by
the
government
in
the
old
days
when
a
sioux
warrior
found
himself
in
the
very
jaws
of
destruction
he
might
offer
a
prayer
to
his
father
the
sun
to
prolong
his
life
if
rescued
from
imminent
danger
he
must
acknowledge
the
divine
favor
by
making
a
sun
dance
according
to
the
vow
embraced
in
his
prayer
in
which
he
declared
that
he
did
not
fear
torture
or
death
but
asked
life
only
for
the
sake
of
those
who
loved
him
thus
the
physical
ordeal
was
the
fulfillment
of
a
vow
and
a
sort
of
atonement
for
what
might
otherwise
appear
to
be
reprehensible
weakness
in
the
face
of
death
it
was
in
the
nature
of
confession
and
to
the
great
mystery
through
the
physical
parent
the
sun
and
did
not
embrace
a
prayer
for
future
favors
the
ceremonies
usually
took
place
from
six
months
to
a
year
after
the
making
of
the
vow
in
order
to
admit
of
suitable
preparation
always
in
midsummer
and
before
a
large
and
imposing
gathering
they
naturally
included
the
making
of
a
feast
and
the
giving
away
of
much
savage
wealth
in
honor
of
the
occasion
although
these
were
no
essential
part
of
the
religious
rite
when
the
day
came
to
procure
the
pole
it
was
brought
in
by
a
party
of
warriors
headed
by
some
man
of
distinction
the
tree
selected
was
six
to
eight
inches
in
diameter
at
the
base
and
twenty
to
feet
high
it
was
chosen
and
felled
with
some
solemnity
including
the
ceremony
of
the
filled
pipe
and
was
carried
in
the
fashion
of
a
litter
symbolizing
the
body
of
the
man
who
made
the
dance
a
solitary
teepee
was
pitched
on
a
level
spot
at
some
distance
from
the
village
and
the
pole
raised
near
at
hand
with
the
same
ceremony
in
the
centre
of
a
circular
enclosure
of
boughs
meanwhile
one
of
the
most
noted
of
our
old
men
had
carved
out
of
rawhide
or
later
of
wood
two
figures
usually
those
of
a
man
and
a
buffalo
sometimes
the
figure
of
a
bird
supposed
to
represent
the
thunder
was
substituted
for
the
buffalo
it
was
customary
to
paint
the
man
red
and
the
animal
black
and
each
was
suspended
from
one
end
of
the
crossbar
which
was
securely
tied
some
two
feet
from
the
top
of
the
pole
i
have
never
been
able
to
determine
that
this
cross
had
any
significance
it
was
probably
nothing
more
than
a
dramatic
coincidence
that
surmounted
the
pole
with
the
symbol
of
christianity
the
paint
indicated
that
the
man
who
was
about
to
give
thanks
publicly
had
been
potentially
dead
but
was
allowed
to
live
by
the
mysterious
favor
and
interference
of
the
giver
of
life
the
buffalo
hung
opposite
the
image
of
his
own
body
in
death
because
it
was
the
support
of
his
physical
self
and
a
leading
figure
in
legendary
lore
following
the
same
line
of
thought
when
he
emerged
from
the
solitary
lodge
of
preparation
and
approached
the
pole
to
dance
nude
save
for
his
breechclout
and
moccasins
his
hair
loosened
and
daubed
with
clay
he
must
drag
after
him
a
buffalo
skull
representing
the
grave
from
which
he
had
escaped
the
dancer
was
cut
or
scarified
on
the
chest
sufficient
to
draw
blood
and
cause
pain
the
natural
accompaniments
of
his
figurative
death
he
took
his
position
opposite
the
singers
facing
the
pole
and
dragging
the
skull
by
leather
thongs
which
were
merely
fastened
about
his
shoulders
during
a
later
period
incisions
were
made
in
the
breast
or
back
sometimes
both
through
which
wooden
skewers
were
drawn
and
secured
by
lariats
to
the
pole
or
to
the
skulls
thus
he
danced
without
intermission
for
a
day
and
a
night
or
even
longer
ever
gazing
at
the
sun
in
the
daytime
and
blowing
from
time
to
time
a
sacred
whistle
made
from
the
bone
of
a
goose
s
wing
in
recent
times
this
rite
was
exaggerated
and
distorted
into
a
mere
ghastly
display
of
physical
strength
and
endurance
under
torture
almost
on
a
level
with
the
caucasian
institution
of
the
or
the
yet
more
modern
moreover
instead
of
an
atonement
or
it
became
the
accompaniment
of
a
prayer
for
success
in
war
or
in
a
raid
upon
the
horses
of
the
enemy
the
number
of
dancers
was
increased
and
they
were
made
to
hang
suspended
from
the
pole
by
their
own
flesh
which
they
must
break
loose
before
being
released
i
well
remember
the
comments
in
our
own
home
upon
the
passing
of
this
simple
but
impressive
ceremony
and
its
loss
of
all
meaning
and
propriety
under
the
demoralizing
additions
which
were
some
of
the
fruits
of
early
contact
with
the
white
man
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
organization
ever
known
among
american
indians
that
of
the
grand
medicine
lodge
was
apparently
an
indirect
result
of
the
labors
of
the
early
jesuit
missionaries
in
it
caucasian
ideas
are
easily
recognizable
and
it
seems
reasonable
to
suppose
that
its
founders
desired
to
establish
an
order
that
would
successfully
resist
the
encroachments
of
the
black
however
that
may
be
it
is
an
unquestionable
fact
that
the
only
religious
leaders
of
any
note
who
have
arisen
among
the
native
tribes
since
the
advent
of
the
white
man
the
shawnee
prophet
in
and
the
prophet
of
the
ghost
dance
in
both
founded
their
claims
or
prophecies
upon
the
gospel
story
thus
in
each
case
an
indian
religious
revival
or
craze
though
more
or
less
threatening
to
the
invader
was
of
distinctively
alien
origin
the
medicine
lodge
originated
among
the
algonquin
tribe
and
extended
gradually
throughout
its
branches
finally
affecting
the
sioux
of
the
mississippi
valley
and
forming
a
strong
bulwark
against
the
work
of
the
pioneer
missionaries
who
secured
indeed
scarcely
any
converts
until
after
the
outbreak
of
when
subjection
starvation
and
imprisonment
turned
our
people
to
accept
christianity
which
seemed
to
offer
them
the
only
gleam
of
kindness
or
hope
the
order
was
a
secret
one
and
in
some
respects
not
unlike
the
free
masons
being
a
union
or
affiliation
of
a
number
of
lodges
each
with
its
distinctive
songs
and
medicines
leadership
was
in
order
of
seniority
in
degrees
which
could
only
be
obtained
by
merit
and
women
were
admitted
to
membership
upon
equal
terms
with
the
possibility
of
attaining
to
the
highest
honors
no
person
might
become
a
member
unless
his
moral
standing
was
excellent
all
candidates
remained
on
probation
for
one
or
two
years
and
murderers
and
adulterers
were
expelled
the
commandments
promulgated
by
this
order
were
essentially
the
same
as
the
mosaic
ten
so
that
it
exerted
a
distinct
moral
influence
in
addition
to
its
ostensible
object
which
was
instruction
in
the
secrets
of
legitimate
medicine
in
this
society
the
uses
of
all
curative
roots
and
herbs
known
to
us
were
taught
exhaustively
and
practiced
mainly
by
the
old
the
younger
members
being
in
training
to
fill
the
places
of
those
who
passed
away
my
grandmother
was
a
and
successful
practitioner
and
both
my
mother
and
father
were
members
but
did
not
practice
a
medicine
or
mystery
feast
was
not
a
public
affair
as
members
only
were
eligible
and
upon
these
occasions
all
the
medicine
bags
and
totems
of
the
various
lodges
were
displayed
and
their
peculiar
medicine
songs
were
sung
the
food
was
only
partaken
of
by
invited
guests
and
not
by
the
hosts
or
lodge
making
the
feast
the
grand
medicine
dance
was
given
on
the
occasion
of
initiating
those
candidates
who
had
finished
their
probation
a
sufficient
number
of
whom
were
designated
to
take
the
places
of
those
who
had
died
since
the
last
meeting
invitations
were
sent
out
in
the
form
of
small
bundles
of
tobacco
two
very
large
teepees
were
pitched
facing
one
another
a
hundred
feet
apart
half
open
and
connected
by
a
roofless
hall
or
colonnade
of
boughs
one
of
these
lodges
was
for
the
society
giving
the
dance
and
the
novices
the
other
was
occupied
by
the
soldiers
whose
duty
it
was
to
distribute
the
refreshments
and
to
keep
order
among
the
spectators
they
were
selected
from
among
the
best
and
bravest
warriors
of
the
tribe
the
preparations
being
complete
and
the
members
of
each
lodge
garbed
and
painted
according
to
their
rituals
they
entered
the
hall
separately
in
single
file
led
by
their
oldest
man
or
great
standing
before
the
soldiers
lodge
facing
the
setting
sun
their
chief
addressed
the
great
mystery
directly
in
a
few
words
after
which
all
extending
the
right
arm
horizontally
from
the
shoulder
with
open
palm
sang
a
short
invocation
in
unison
ending
with
a
deep
this
performance
which
was
really
impressive
was
repeated
in
front
of
the
headquarters
lodge
facing
the
rising
sun
after
which
each
lodge
took
its
assigned
place
and
the
songs
and
dances
followed
in
regular
order
the
closing
ceremony
which
was
intensely
dramatic
in
its
character
was
the
initiation
of
the
novices
who
had
received
their
final
preparation
on
the
night
before
they
were
now
led
out
in
front
of
the
headquarters
lodge
and
placed
in
a
kneeling
position
upon
a
carpet
of
rich
robes
and
furs
the
men
upon
the
right
hand
stripped
and
painted
black
with
a
round
spot
of
red
just
over
the
heart
while
the
women
dressed
in
their
best
were
arranged
upon
the
left
both
sexes
wore
the
hair
loose
as
if
in
mourning
or
expectation
of
death
an
equal
number
of
grand
each
of
whom
was
especially
appointed
to
one
of
the
novices
faced
them
at
a
distance
of
half
the
length
of
the
hall
or
perhaps
fifty
feet
after
silent
prayer
each
in
turn
addressed
himself
to
his
charge
exhorting
him
to
observe
all
the
rules
of
the
order
under
the
eye
of
the
mysterious
one
and
instructing
him
in
his
duty
toward
his
and
toward
the
ruler
of
life
all
then
assumed
an
attitude
of
superb
power
and
dignity
crouching
slightly
as
if
about
to
spring
forward
in
a
and
grasping
their
medicine
bags
firmly
in
both
hands
swinging
their
arms
forward
at
the
same
moment
they
uttered
their
guttural
in
perfect
unison
and
with
startling
effect
in
the
midst
of
a
breathless
silence
they
took
a
step
forward
then
another
and
another
ending
a
rod
or
so
from
the
row
of
kneeling
victims
with
a
mighty
swing
of
the
sacred
bags
that
would
seem
to
project
all
their
mystic
power
into
the
bodies
of
the
initiates
instantly
they
all
fell
forward
apparently
lifeless
with
this
thrilling
climax
the
drums
were
vigorously
pounded
and
the
dance
began
again
with
energy
after
a
few
turns
had
been
taken
about
the
prostrate
bodies
of
the
new
members
covering
them
with
fine
robes
and
other
garments
which
were
later
to
be
distributed
as
gifts
they
were
permitted
to
come
to
life
and
to
join
in
the
final
dance
the
whole
performance
was
clearly
symbolic
of
death
and
resurrection
while
i
can
not
suppose
that
this
elaborate
ritual
with
its
use
of
public
and
audible
prayer
of
public
exhortation
or
sermon
and
other
caucasian
features
was
practiced
before
comparatively
modern
times
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
was
conscientiously
believed
in
by
its
members
and
for
a
time
regarded
with
reverence
by
the
people
but
at
a
later
period
it
became
still
further
demoralized
and
fell
under
suspicion
of
witchcraft
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
indian
held
medicine
close
to
spiritual
things
but
in
this
also
he
has
been
much
misunderstood
in
fact
everything
that
he
held
sacred
is
indiscriminately
called
medicine
in
the
sense
of
mystery
or
magic
as
a
doctor
he
was
originally
very
adroit
and
often
successful
he
employed
only
healing
bark
roots
and
leaves
with
whose
properties
he
was
familiar
using
them
in
the
form
of
a
distillation
or
tea
and
always
singly
the
stomach
or
internal
bath
was
a
valuable
discovery
of
his
and
the
vapor
or
turkish
bath
was
in
general
use
he
could
set
a
broken
bone
with
fair
success
but
never
practiced
surgery
in
any
form
in
addition
to
all
this
the
possessed
much
personal
magnetism
and
authority
and
in
his
treatment
often
sought
to
reestablish
the
equilibrium
of
the
patient
through
mental
or
spiritual
influences
a
sort
of
primitive
psychotherapy
the
sioux
word
for
the
healing
art
is
which
literally
means
readjusting
or
making
anew
literally
root
means
medicine
and
wakan
signifies
spirit
or
mystery
thus
the
three
ideas
while
sometimes
associated
were
carefully
distinguished
it
is
important
to
remember
that
in
the
old
days
the
received
no
payment
for
his
services
which
were
of
the
nature
of
an
honorable
function
or
office
when
the
idea
of
payment
and
barter
was
introduced
among
us
and
valuable
presents
or
fees
began
to
be
demanded
for
treating
the
sick
the
ensuing
greed
and
rivalry
led
to
many
demoralizing
practices
and
in
time
to
the
rise
of
the
modern
conjurer
who
is
generally
a
fraud
and
trickster
of
the
grossest
kind
it
is
fortunate
that
his
day
is
practically
over
ever
seeking
to
establish
spiritual
comradeship
with
the
animal
creation
the
indian
adopted
this
or
that
animal
as
his
totem
the
emblematic
device
of
his
society
family
or
clan
it
is
probable
that
the
creature
chosen
was
the
traditional
ancestress
as
we
are
told
that
the
first
man
had
many
wives
among
the
animal
people
the
sacred
beast
bird
or
reptile
represented
by
its
stuffed
skin
or
by
a
rude
painting
was
treated
with
reverence
and
carried
into
battle
to
insure
the
guardianship
of
the
spirits
the
symbolic
attribute
of
beaver
bear
or
tortoise
such
as
wisdom
cunning
courage
and
the
like
was
supposed
to
be
mysteriously
conferred
upon
the
wearer
of
the
badge
the
totem
or
charm
used
in
medicine
was
ordinarily
that
of
the
medicine
lodge
to
which
the
practitioner
belonged
though
there
were
some
great
men
who
boasted
a
special
revelation
there
are
two
ceremonial
usages
which
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
ascertain
were
universal
among
american
indians
and
apparently
fundamental
these
have
already
been
referred
to
as
the
eneepee
or
and
the
or
ceremonial
of
the
pipe
in
our
siouan
legends
and
traditions
these
two
are
preeminent
as
handed
down
from
the
most
ancient
time
and
persisting
to
the
last
in
our
creation
myth
or
story
of
the
first
man
the
was
the
magic
used
by
to
give
life
to
the
dead
bones
of
his
younger
brother
who
had
been
slain
by
the
monsters
of
the
deep
upon
the
shore
of
the
great
water
he
dug
two
round
holes
over
one
of
which
he
built
a
low
enclosure
of
fragrant
cedar
boughs
and
here
he
gathered
together
the
bones
of
his
brother
in
the
other
pit
he
made
a
fire
and
heated
four
round
stones
which
he
rolled
one
by
one
into
the
lodge
of
boughs
having
closed
every
aperture
save
one
he
sang
a
mystic
chant
while
he
thrust
in
his
arm
and
sprinkled
water
upon
the
stones
with
a
bunch
of
sage
immediately
steam
arose
and
as
the
legend
says
there
was
an
appearance
of
a
second
time
he
sprinkled
water
and
the
dry
bones
rattled
together
the
third
time
he
seemed
to
hear
soft
singing
from
within
the
lodge
and
the
fourth
time
a
voice
exclaimed
brother
let
me
out
it
should
be
noted
that
the
number
four
is
the
magic
or
sacred
number
of
the
indian
this
story
gives
the
traditional
origin
of
the
eneepee
which
has
ever
since
been
deemed
essential
to
the
indian
s
effort
to
purify
and
recreate
his
spirit
it
is
used
both
by
the
doctor
and
by
his
patient
every
man
must
enter
the
cleansing
bath
and
take
the
cold
plunge
which
follows
when
preparing
for
any
spiritual
crisis
for
possible
death
or
imminent
danger
not
only
the
eneepee
itself
but
everything
used
in
connection
with
the
mysterious
event
the
aromatic
cedar
and
sage
the
water
and
especially
the
boulders
are
regarded
as
sacred
or
at
the
least
adapted
to
a
spiritual
use
for
the
rock
we
have
a
special
reverent
name
tunkan
a
contraction
of
the
sioux
word
for
grandfather
the
natural
boulder
enters
into
many
of
our
solemn
ceremonials
such
as
the
rain
dance
and
the
feast
of
the
lone
hunter
and
warrior
reverently
holds
up
his
filled
pipe
to
tunkan
in
solitary
commemoration
of
a
miracle
which
to
him
is
as
authentic
and
holy
as
the
raising
of
lazarus
to
the
devout
christian
there
is
a
legend
that
the
first
man
fell
sick
and
was
taught
by
his
elder
brother
the
ceremonial
use
of
the
pipe
in
a
prayer
to
the
spirits
for
ease
and
relief
this
simple
ceremony
is
the
commonest
daily
expression
of
thanks
or
grace
as
well
as
an
oath
of
loyalty
and
good
faith
when
the
warrior
goes
forth
upon
some
perilous
enterprise
and
it
enters
even
into
his
hambeday
or
solitary
prayer
ascending
as
a
rising
vapor
or
incense
to
the
father
of
spirits
in
all
the
war
ceremonies
and
in
medicine
a
special
pipe
is
used
but
at
home
or
on
the
hunt
the
warrior
employs
his
own
the
pulverized
weed
is
mixed
with
aromatic
bark
of
the
red
willow
and
pressed
lightly
into
the
bowl
of
the
long
stone
pipe
the
worshiper
lights
it
gravely
and
takes
a
whiff
or
two
then
standing
erect
he
holds
it
silently
toward
the
sun
our
father
and
toward
the
earth
our
mother
there
are
modern
variations
as
holding
the
pipe
to
the
four
winds
the
fire
water
rock
and
other
elements
or
objects
of
reverence
there
are
many
religious
festivals
which
are
local
and
special
in
character
embodying
a
prayer
for
success
in
hunting
or
warfare
or
for
rain
and
bountiful
harvests
but
these
two
are
the
sacraments
of
our
religion
for
baptism
we
substitute
the
eneepee
the
purification
by
vapor
and
in
our
holy
communion
we
partake
of
the
soothing
incense
of
tobacco
in
the
stead
of
bread
and
wine
iv
barbarism
and
the
moral
code
silence
the
of
character
basic
ideas
of
morality
give
all
or
nothing
rules
of
honorable
warfare
an
indian
conception
of
courage
long
before
i
ever
heard
of
christ
or
saw
a
white
man
i
had
learned
from
an
untutored
woman
the
essence
of
morality
with
the
help
of
dear
nature
herself
she
taught
me
things
simple
but
of
mighty
import
i
knew
god
i
perceived
what
goodness
is
i
saw
and
loved
what
is
really
beautiful
civilization
has
not
taught
me
anything
better
as
a
child
i
understood
how
to
give
i
have
forgotten
that
grace
since
i
became
civilized
i
lived
the
natural
life
whereas
i
now
live
the
artificial
any
pretty
pebble
was
valuable
to
me
then
every
growing
tree
an
object
of
reverence
now
i
worship
with
the
white
man
before
a
painted
landscape
whose
value
is
estimated
in
dollars
thus
the
indian
is
reconstructed
as
the
natural
rocks
are
ground
to
powder
and
made
into
artificial
blocks
which
may
be
built
into
the
walls
of
modern
society
the
first
american
mingled
with
his
pride
a
singular
humility
spiritual
arrogance
was
foreign
to
his
nature
and
teaching
he
never
claimed
that
the
power
of
articulate
speech
was
proof
of
superiority
over
the
dumb
creation
on
the
other
hand
it
is
to
him
a
perilous
gift
he
believes
profoundly
in
silence
the
sign
of
a
perfect
equilibrium
silence
is
the
absolute
poise
or
balance
of
body
mind
and
spirit
the
man
who
preserves
his
selfhood
ever
calm
and
unshaken
by
the
storms
of
existence
not
a
leaf
as
it
were
astir
on
the
tree
not
a
ripple
upon
the
surface
of
shining
pool
his
in
the
mind
of
the
unlettered
sage
is
the
ideal
attitude
and
conduct
of
life
if
you
ask
him
what
is
silence
he
will
answer
it
is
the
great
mystery
the
holy
silence
is
his
voice
if
you
ask
what
are
the
fruits
of
silence
he
will
say
they
are
true
courage
or
endurance
patience
dignity
and
reverence
silence
is
the
cornerstone
of
guard
your
tongue
in
youth
said
the
old
chief
wabashaw
and
in
age
you
may
mature
a
thought
that
will
be
of
service
to
your
people
the
moment
that
man
conceived
of
a
perfect
body
supple
symmetrical
graceful
and
enduring
in
that
moment
he
had
laid
the
foundation
of
a
moral
life
no
man
can
hope
to
maintain
such
a
temple
of
the
spirit
beyond
the
period
of
adolescence
unless
he
is
able
to
curb
his
indulgence
in
the
pleasures
of
the
senses
upon
this
truth
the
indian
built
a
rigid
system
of
physical
training
a
social
and
moral
code
that
was
the
law
of
his
life
there
was
aroused
in
him
as
a
child
a
high
ideal
of
manly
strength
and
beauty
the
attainment
of
which
must
depend
upon
strict
temperance
in
eating
and
in
the
sexual
relation
together
with
severe
and
persistent
exercise
he
desired
to
be
a
worthy
link
in
the
generations
and
that
he
might
not
destroy
by
his
weakness
that
vigor
and
purity
of
blood
which
had
been
achieved
at
the
cost
of
much
by
a
long
line
of
ancestors
he
was
required
to
fast
from
time
to
time
for
short
periods
and
to
work
off
his
superfluous
energy
by
means
of
hard
running
swimming
and
the
the
bodily
fatigue
thus
induced
especially
when
coupled
with
a
reduced
diet
is
a
reliable
cure
for
undue
sexual
desires
personal
modesty
was
early
cultivated
as
a
safeguard
together
with
a
strong
and
pride
of
family
and
race
this
was
accomplished
in
part
by
keeping
the
child
ever
before
the
public
eye
from
his
birth
onward
his
entrance
into
the
world
especially
in
the
case
of
the
was
often
publicly
announced
by
the
herald
accompanied
by
a
distribution
of
presents
to
the
old
and
needy
the
same
thing
occurred
when
he
took
his
first
step
when
his
ears
were
pierced
and
when
he
shot
his
first
game
so
that
his
childish
exploits
and
progress
were
known
to
the
whole
clan
as
to
a
larger
family
and
he
grew
into
manhood
with
the
saving
sense
of
a
reputation
to
sustain
the
youth
was
encouraged
to
enlist
early
in
the
public
service
and
to
develop
a
wholesome
ambition
for
the
honors
of
a
leader
and
which
can
never
be
his
unless
he
is
truthful
and
generous
as
well
as
brave
and
ever
mindful
of
his
personal
chastity
and
honor
there
were
many
ceremonial
customs
which
had
a
distinct
moral
influence
the
woman
was
rigidly
secluded
at
certain
periods
and
the
young
husband
was
forbidden
to
approach
his
own
wife
when
preparing
for
war
or
for
any
religious
event
the
public
or
tribal
position
of
the
indian
is
entirely
dependent
upon
his
private
virtue
and
he
is
never
permitted
to
forget
that
he
does
not
live
to
himself
alone
but
to
his
tribe
and
his
clan
thus
habits
of
perfect
were
early
established
and
there
were
no
unnatural
conditions
or
complex
temptations
to
beset
him
until
he
was
met
and
overthrown
by
a
stronger
race
to
keep
the
young
men
and
young
women
strictly
to
their
honor
there
were
observed
among
us
within
my
own
recollection
certain
annual
ceremonies
of
a
nature
one
of
the
most
impressive
of
these
was
the
sacred
feast
of
virgins
which
when
given
for
the
first
time
was
equivalent
to
the
public
announcement
of
a
young
girl
s
arrival
at
a
marriageable
age
the
herald
making
the
rounds
of
the
teepee
village
would
publish
the
feast
something
after
this
fashion
pretty
the
daughter
of
brave
bear
will
kindle
her
first
maidens
fire
all
ye
who
have
never
yielded
to
the
pleading
of
man
who
have
not
destroyed
your
innocency
you
alone
are
invited
to
proclaim
anew
before
the
sun
and
the
earth
before
your
companions
and
in
the
sight
of
the
great
mystery
the
chastity
and
purity
of
your
maidenhood
come
ye
all
who
have
not
known
man
the
whole
village
was
at
once
aroused
to
the
interest
of
the
coming
event
which
was
considered
next
to
the
sun
dance
and
the
grand
medicine
dance
in
public
importance
it
always
took
place
in
midsummer
when
a
number
of
different
clans
were
gathered
together
for
the
summer
festivities
and
was
held
in
the
centre
of
the
great
circular
encampment
here
two
circles
were
described
one
within
the
other
about
a
rudely
rock
which
was
touched
with
red
paint
and
upon
either
side
of
the
rock
there
were
thrust
into
the
ground
a
knife
and
two
arrows
the
inner
circle
was
for
the
maidens
and
the
outer
one
for
their
grandmothers
or
chaperones
who
were
supposed
to
have
passed
the
climacteric
upon
the
outskirts
of
the
feast
there
was
a
great
public
gathering
in
which
order
was
kept
by
certain
warriors
of
highest
reputation
any
man
among
the
spectators
might
approach
and
challenge
any
young
woman
whom
he
knew
to
be
unworthy
but
if
the
accuser
failed
to
prove
his
charge
the
warriors
were
accustomed
to
punish
him
severely
each
girl
in
turn
approached
the
sacred
rock
and
laid
her
hand
upon
it
with
all
solemnity
this
was
her
religious
declaration
of
her
virginity
her
vow
to
remain
pure
until
her
marriage
if
she
should
ever
violate
the
maidens
oath
then
welcome
that
keen
knife
and
those
sharp
arrows
our
maidens
were
ambitious
to
attend
a
number
of
these
feasts
before
marriage
and
it
sometimes
happened
that
a
girl
was
compelled
to
give
one
on
account
of
gossip
about
her
conduct
then
it
was
in
the
nature
of
a
challenge
to
the
to
prove
their
words
a
similar
feast
was
sometimes
made
by
the
young
men
for
whom
the
rules
were
even
more
strict
since
no
young
man
might
attend
this
feast
who
had
so
much
as
spoken
of
love
to
a
maiden
it
was
considered
a
high
honor
among
us
to
have
won
some
distinction
in
war
and
the
chase
and
above
all
to
have
been
invited
to
a
seat
in
the
council
before
one
had
spoken
to
any
girl
save
his
own
sister
it
was
our
belief
that
the
love
of
possessions
is
a
weakness
to
be
overcome
its
appeal
is
to
the
material
part
and
if
allowed
its
way
it
will
in
time
disturb
the
spiritual
balance
of
the
man
therefore
the
child
must
early
learn
the
beauty
of
generosity
he
is
taught
to
give
what
he
prizes
most
and
that
he
may
taste
the
happiness
of
giving
he
is
made
at
an
early
age
the
family
almoner
if
a
child
is
inclined
to
be
grasping
or
to
cling
to
any
of
his
little
possessions
legends
are
related
to
him
telling
of
the
contempt
and
disgrace
falling
upon
the
ungenerous
and
mean
man
public
giving
is
a
part
of
every
important
ceremony
it
properly
belongs
to
the
celebration
of
birth
marriage
and
death
and
is
observed
whenever
it
is
desired
to
do
special
honor
to
any
person
or
event
upon
such
occasions
it
is
common
to
give
to
the
point
of
utter
impoverishment
the
indian
in
his
simplicity
literally
gives
away
all
that
he
has
to
relatives
to
guests
of
another
tribe
or
clan
but
above
all
to
the
poor
and
the
aged
from
whom
he
can
hope
for
no
return
finally
the
gift
to
the
great
mystery
the
religious
offering
may
be
of
little
value
in
itself
but
to
the
giver
s
own
thought
it
should
carry
the
meaning
and
reward
of
true
sacrifice
orphans
and
the
aged
are
invariably
cared
for
not
only
by
their
next
of
kin
but
by
the
whole
clan
it
is
the
loving
parent
s
pride
to
have
his
daughters
visit
the
unfortunate
and
the
helpless
carry
them
food
comb
their
hair
and
mend
their
garments
the
name
wenonah
bestowed
upon
the
eldest
daughter
distinctly
implies
all
this
and
a
girl
who
failed
in
her
charitable
duties
was
held
to
be
unworthy
of
the
name
the
man
who
is
a
skillful
hunter
and
whose
wife
is
alive
to
her
opportunities
makes
many
feasts
to
which
he
is
careful
to
invite
the
older
men
of
his
clan
recognizing
that
they
have
outlived
their
period
of
greatest
activity
and
now
love
nothing
so
well
as
to
eat
in
good
company
and
to
live
over
the
past
the
old
men
for
their
part
do
their
best
to
requite
his
liberality
with
a
little
speech
in
which
they
are
apt
to
relate
the
brave
and
generous
deeds
of
their
host
s
ancestors
finally
congratulating
him
upon
being
a
worthy
successor
of
an
honorable
line
thus
his
reputation
is
won
as
a
hunter
and
a
and
almost
as
famous
in
his
way
as
the
great
warrior
is
he
who
has
a
recognized
name
and
standing
as
a
man
of
the
true
indian
sets
no
price
upon
either
his
property
or
his
labor
his
generosity
is
only
limited
by
his
strength
and
ability
he
regards
it
as
an
honor
to
be
selected
for
a
difficult
or
dangerous
service
and
would
think
it
shame
to
ask
for
any
reward
saying
rather
let
him
whom
i
serve
express
his
thanks
according
to
his
own
bringing
up
and
his
sense
of
honor
nevertheless
he
recognizes
rights
in
property
to
steal
from
one
of
his
own
tribe
would
be
indeed
disgrace
and
if
discovered
the
name
of
wamanon
or
thief
is
fixed
upon
him
forever
as
an
unalterable
stigma
the
only
exception
to
the
rule
is
in
the
case
of
food
which
is
always
free
to
the
hungry
if
there
is
none
by
to
offer
it
other
protection
than
the
moral
law
there
could
not
be
in
an
indian
community
where
there
were
neither
locks
nor
doors
and
everything
was
open
and
easy
of
access
to
all
comers
the
property
of
the
enemy
is
spoil
of
war
and
it
is
always
allowable
to
confiscate
it
if
possible
however
in
the
old
days
there
was
not
much
plunder
before
the
coming
of
the
white
man
there
was
in
fact
little
temptation
or
opportunity
to
despoil
the
enemy
but
in
modern
times
the
practice
of
stealing
horses
from
hostile
tribes
has
become
common
and
is
thought
far
from
dishonorable
warfare
we
regarded
as
an
institution
of
the
great
mystery
an
organized
tournament
or
trial
of
courage
and
skill
with
elaborate
rules
and
counts
for
the
coveted
honor
of
the
eagle
feather
it
was
held
to
develop
the
quality
of
manliness
and
its
motive
was
chivalric
or
patriotic
but
never
the
desire
for
territorial
aggrandizement
or
the
overthrow
of
a
brother
nation
it
was
common
in
early
times
for
a
battle
or
skirmish
to
last
all
day
with
great
display
of
daring
and
horsemanship
but
with
scarcely
more
killed
and
wounded
than
may
be
carried
from
the
field
during
a
university
game
of
football
the
slayer
of
a
man
in
battle
was
expected
to
mourn
for
thirty
days
blackening
his
face
and
loosening
his
hair
according
to
the
custom
he
of
course
considered
it
no
sin
to
take
the
life
of
an
enemy
and
this
ceremonial
mourning
was
a
sign
of
reverence
for
the
departed
spirit
the
killing
in
war
of
such
as
women
and
children
is
partly
explained
by
the
fact
that
in
savage
life
the
woman
without
husband
or
protector
is
in
pitiable
case
and
it
was
supposed
that
the
spirit
of
the
warrior
would
be
better
content
if
no
widow
and
orphans
were
left
to
suffer
want
as
well
as
to
weep
a
scalp
might
originally
be
taken
by
the
leader
of
the
war
party
only
and
at
that
period
no
other
mutilation
was
practiced
it
was
a
small
lock
not
more
than
three
inches
square
which
was
carried
only
during
the
thirty
days
celebration
of
a
victory
and
afterward
given
religious
burial
wanton
cruelties
and
the
more
barbarous
customs
of
war
were
greatly
intensified
with
the
coming
of
the
white
man
who
brought
with
him
fiery
liquor
and
deadly
weapons
aroused
the
indian
s
worst
passions
provoking
in
him
revenge
and
cupidity
and
even
offered
bounties
for
the
scalps
of
innocent
men
women
and
children
murder
within
the
tribe
was
a
grave
offense
to
be
atoned
for
as
the
council
might
decree
and
it
often
happened
that
the
slayer
was
called
upon
to
pay
the
penalty
with
his
own
life
he
made
no
attempt
to
escape
or
to
evade
justice
that
the
crime
was
committed
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
or
at
dead
of
night
witnessed
by
no
human
eye
made
no
difference
to
his
mind
he
was
thoroughly
convinced
that
all
is
known
to
the
great
mystery
and
hence
did
not
hesitate
to
give
himself
up
to
stand
his
trial
by
the
old
and
wise
men
of
the
victim
s
clan
his
own
family
and
clan
might
by
no
means
attempt
to
excuse
or
to
defend
him
but
his
judges
took
all
the
known
circumstances
into
consideration
and
if
it
appeared
that
he
slew
in
or
that
the
provocation
was
severe
he
might
be
set
free
after
a
thirty
days
period
of
mourning
in
solitude
otherwise
the
murdered
man
s
next
of
kin
were
authorized
to
take
his
life
and
if
they
refrained
from
doing
so
as
often
happened
he
remained
an
outcast
from
the
clan
a
willful
murder
was
a
rare
occurrence
before
the
days
of
whiskey
and
drunken
rows
for
we
were
not
a
violent
or
a
quarrelsome
people
it
is
well
remembered
that
crow
dog
who
killed
the
sioux
chief
spotted
tail
in
calmly
surrendered
himself
and
was
tried
and
convicted
by
the
courts
in
south
dakota
after
his
conviction
he
was
permitted
remarkable
liberty
in
prison
such
as
perhaps
no
white
man
has
ever
enjoyed
when
under
sentence
of
death
the
cause
of
his
act
was
a
solemn
commission
received
from
his
people
nearly
thirty
years
earlier
at
the
time
that
spotted
tail
usurped
the
chieftainship
by
the
aid
of
the
military
whom
he
had
aided
crow
dog
was
under
a
vow
to
slay
the
chief
in
case
he
ever
betrayed
or
disgraced
the
name
of
the
brule
sioux
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
had
committed
crimes
both
public
and
private
having
been
guilty
of
misuse
of
office
as
well
as
of
gross
offenses
against
morality
therefore
his
death
was
not
a
matter
of
personal
vengeance
but
of
just
retribution
a
few
days
before
crow
dog
was
to
be
executed
he
asked
permission
to
visit
his
home
and
say
farewell
to
his
wife
and
twin
boys
then
nine
or
ten
years
old
strange
to
say
the
request
was
granted
and
the
condemned
man
sent
home
under
escort
of
the
deputy
sheriff
who
remained
at
the
indian
agency
merely
telling
his
prisoner
to
report
there
on
the
following
day
when
he
did
not
appear
at
the
time
set
the
sheriff
dispatched
the
indian
police
after
him
they
did
not
find
him
and
his
wife
simply
said
that
crow
dog
had
desired
to
ride
alone
to
the
prison
and
would
reach
there
on
the
day
appointed
all
doubt
was
removed
next
day
by
a
telegram
from
rapid
city
two
hundred
miles
distant
saying
crow
dog
has
just
reported
the
incident
drew
public
attention
to
the
indian
murderer
with
the
unexpected
result
that
the
case
was
reopened
and
crow
dog
acquitted
he
still
lives
a
man
of
about
years
and
is
much
respected
among
his
own
people
it
is
said
that
in
the
very
early
days
lying
was
a
capital
offense
among
us
believing
that
the
deliberate
liar
is
capable
of
committing
any
crime
behind
the
screen
of
cowardly
untruth
and
the
destroyer
of
mutual
confidence
was
summarily
put
to
death
that
the
evil
might
go
no
further
even
the
worst
enemies
of
the
indian
those
who
accuse
him
of
treachery
cruelty
and
lust
have
not
denied
his
courage
but
in
their
minds
it
is
a
courage
that
is
ignorant
brutal
and
fantastic
his
own
conception
of
bravery
makes
of
it
a
high
moral
virtue
for
to
him
it
consists
not
so
much
in
aggressive
as
in
absolute
the
truly
brave
man
we
contend
yields
neither
to
fear
nor
anger
desire
nor
agony
he
is
at
all
times
master
of
himself
his
courage
rises
to
the
heights
of
chivalry
patriotism
and
real
heroism
let
neither
cold
hunger
nor
pain
nor
the
fear
of
them
neither
the
bristling
teeth
of
danger
nor
the
very
jaws
of
death
itself
prevent
you
from
doing
a
good
deed
said
an
old
chief
to
a
scout
who
was
about
to
seek
the
buffalo
in
midwinter
for
the
relief
of
a
starving
people
this
was
his
childlike
conception
of
courage
the
unwritten
scriptures
a
living
book
the
sioux
story
of
creation
the
first
battle
another
version
of
the
flood
our
animal
ancestry
a
missionary
once
undertook
to
instruct
a
group
of
indians
in
the
truths
of
his
holy
religion
he
told
them
of
the
creation
of
the
earth
in
six
days
and
of
the
fall
of
our
first
parents
by
eating
an
apple
the
courteous
savages
listened
attentively
and
after
thanking
him
one
related
in
his
turn
a
very
ancient
tradition
concerning
the
origin
of
the
maize
but
the
missionary
plainly
showed
his
disgust
and
disbelief
indignantly
saying
what
i
delivered
to
you
were
sacred
truths
but
this
that
you
tell
me
is
mere
fable
and
falsehood
my
brother
gravely
replied
the
offended
indian
it
seems
that
you
have
not
been
well
grounded
in
the
rules
of
civility
you
saw
that
we
who
practice
these
rules
believed
your
stories
why
then
do
you
refuse
to
credit
ours
every
religion
has
its
holy
book
and
ours
was
a
mingling
of
history
poetry
and
prophecy
of
precept
and
even
such
as
the
modern
reader
finds
within
the
covers
of
his
bible
this
bible
of
ours
was
our
whole
literature
a
living
book
sowed
as
precious
seed
by
our
wisest
sages
and
springing
anew
in
the
wondering
eyes
and
upon
the
innocent
lips
of
little
children
upon
its
hoary
wisdom
of
proverb
and
fable
its
mystic
and
legendary
lore
thus
sacredly
preserved
and
transmitted
from
father
to
son
was
based
in
large
part
our
customs
and
philosophy
naturally
magnanimous
and
the
red
man
prefers
to
believe
that
the
spirit
of
god
is
not
breathed
into
man
alone
but
that
the
whole
created
universe
is
a
sharer
in
the
immortal
perfection
of
its
maker
his
imaginative
and
poetic
mind
like
that
of
the
greek
assigns
to
every
mountain
tree
and
spring
its
spirit
nymph
or
divinity
either
beneficent
or
mischievous
the
heroes
and
demigods
of
indian
tradition
reflect
the
characteristic
trend
of
his
thought
and
his
attribution
of
personality
and
will
to
the
elements
the
sun
and
stars
and
all
animate
or
inanimate
nature
in
the
sioux
story
of
creation
the
great
mysterious
one
is
not
brought
directly
upon
the
scene
or
conceived
in
anthropomorphic
fashion
but
remains
sublimely
in
the
background
the
sun
and
the
earth
representing
the
male
and
female
principles
are
the
main
elements
in
his
creation
the
other
planets
being
subsidiary
the
enkindling
warmth
of
the
sun
entered
into
the
bosom
of
our
mother
the
earth
and
forthwith
she
conceived
and
brought
forth
life
both
vegetable
and
animal
finally
there
appeared
mysteriously
the
a
being
in
the
likeness
of
man
yet
more
than
man
who
roamed
solitary
among
the
animal
people
and
understood
their
ways
and
their
language
they
beheld
him
with
wonder
and
awe
for
they
could
do
nothing
without
his
knowledge
he
had
pitched
his
tent
in
the
centre
of
the
land
and
there
was
no
spot
impossible
for
him
to
penetrate
at
last
like
adam
the
of
the
sioux
became
weary
of
living
alone
and
formed
for
himself
a
companion
not
a
mate
but
a
brother
not
out
of
a
rib
from
his
side
but
from
a
splinter
which
he
drew
from
his
great
toe
this
was
the
little
boy
man
who
was
not
created
but
as
an
innocent
child
trusting
and
helpless
his
elder
brother
was
his
teacher
throughout
every
stage
of
human
progress
from
infancy
to
manhood
and
it
is
to
the
rules
which
he
laid
down
and
his
counsels
to
the
little
boy
man
that
we
trace
many
of
our
most
beliefs
and
most
sacred
customs
foremost
among
the
animal
people
was
the
spider
the
original
who
noted
keenly
the
growth
of
the
boy
in
wit
and
ingenuity
and
presently
advised
the
animals
to
make
an
end
of
him
for
said
he
if
you
do
not
some
day
he
will
be
the
master
of
us
all
but
they
all
loved
the
little
boy
man
because
he
was
so
friendly
and
so
playful
only
the
monsters
of
the
deep
sea
listened
and
presently
took
his
life
hiding
his
body
in
the
bottom
of
the
sea
nevertheless
by
the
magic
power
of
the
the
body
was
recovered
and
was
given
life
again
in
the
sacred
as
described
in
a
former
chapter
once
more
our
first
ancestor
roamed
happily
among
the
animal
people
who
were
in
those
days
a
powerful
nation
he
learned
their
ways
and
their
language
for
they
had
a
common
tongue
in
those
days
learned
to
sing
like
the
birds
to
swim
like
the
fishes
and
to
climb
over
rocks
like
the
mountain
sheep
notwithstanding
that
he
was
their
good
comrade
and
did
them
no
harm
once
more
sowed
dissension
among
the
animals
and
messages
were
sent
into
all
quarters
of
the
earth
sea
and
air
that
all
the
tribes
might
unite
to
declare
war
upon
the
solitary
man
who
was
destined
to
become
their
master
after
a
time
the
young
man
discovered
the
plot
and
came
home
very
sorrowful
he
loved
his
animal
friends
and
was
grieved
that
they
should
combine
against
him
besides
he
was
naked
and
unarmed
but
his
elder
brother
armed
him
with
a
bow
and
arrows
a
stone
and
a
spear
he
likewise
tossed
a
pebble
four
times
into
the
air
and
each
time
it
became
a
cliff
or
wall
of
rock
about
the
teepee
now
said
he
it
is
time
to
fight
and
to
assert
your
supremacy
for
it
is
they
who
have
brought
the
trouble
upon
you
and
not
you
upon
them
night
and
day
the
little
boy
man
remained
upon
the
watch
for
his
enemies
from
the
top
of
the
wall
and
at
last
he
beheld
the
prairies
black
with
buffalo
herds
and
the
elk
gathering
upon
the
edges
of
the
forest
bears
and
wolves
were
closing
in
from
all
directions
and
now
from
the
sky
the
thunder
gave
his
fearful
answered
by
the
wolf
s
long
howl
the
badgers
and
other
burrowers
began
at
once
to
undermine
his
rocky
fortress
while
the
climbers
undertook
to
scale
its
perpendicular
walls
then
for
the
first
time
on
earth
the
bow
was
strung
and
hundreds
of
arrows
found
their
mark
in
the
bodies
of
the
animals
while
each
time
that
the
boy
man
swung
his
stone
his
enemies
fell
in
countless
numbers
finally
the
insects
the
little
people
of
the
air
attacked
him
in
a
body
filling
his
eyes
and
ears
and
tormenting
him
with
their
poisoned
spears
so
that
he
was
in
despair
he
called
for
help
upon
his
elder
brother
who
ordered
him
to
strike
the
rocks
with
his
stone
as
soon
as
he
had
done
so
sparks
of
fire
flew
upon
the
dry
grass
of
the
prairie
and
it
burst
into
flame
a
mighty
smoke
ascended
which
drove
away
the
teasing
swarms
of
the
insect
people
while
the
flames
terrified
and
scattered
the
others
this
was
the
first
dividing
of
the
trail
between
man
and
the
animal
people
and
when
the
animals
had
sued
for
peace
the
treaty
provided
that
they
must
ever
after
furnish
man
with
flesh
for
his
food
and
skins
for
clothing
though
not
without
effort
and
danger
on
his
part
the
little
insects
refused
to
make
any
concession
and
have
ever
since
been
the
tormentors
of
man
however
the
birds
of
the
air
declared
that
they
would
punish
them
for
their
obstinacy
and
this
they
continue
to
do
unto
this
day
our
people
have
always
claimed
that
the
stone
arrows
which
are
found
so
generally
throughout
the
country
are
the
ones
that
the
first
man
used
in
his
battle
with
the
animals
it
is
not
recorded
in
our
traditions
much
less
is
it
within
the
memory
of
our
old
men
that
we
have
ever
made
or
used
similar
some
have
tried
to
make
use
of
them
for
shooting
fish
under
water
but
with
little
success
and
they
are
absolutely
useless
with
the
indian
bow
which
was
in
use
when
america
was
discovered
it
is
possible
that
they
were
made
by
some
race
who
used
much
longer
and
stronger
bows
and
who
were
workers
in
stone
which
our
people
were
not
their
stone
implements
were
merely
natural
boulders
or
flint
chips
fitted
with
handles
of
or
wood
except
the
pipes
which
were
carved
from
a
species
of
stone
which
is
soft
when
first
quarried
and
therefore
easily
worked
with
the
most
primitive
tools
practically
all
the
flint
that
we
see
in
museums
and
elsewhere
were
picked
up
or
ploughed
up
while
some
have
been
dishonestly
sold
by
trafficking
indians
and
others
embedded
in
trees
and
bones
we
had
neither
devil
nor
hell
in
our
religion
until
the
white
man
brought
them
to
us
yet
the
spider
was
doubtless
akin
to
that
old
serpent
who
tempted
mother
eve
he
is
always
characterized
as
tricky
treacherous
and
at
the
same
time
affable
and
charming
being
not
without
the
gifts
of
wit
prophecy
and
eloquence
he
is
an
adroit
magician
able
to
assume
almost
any
form
at
will
and
impervious
to
any
amount
of
ridicule
and
insult
here
we
have
it
appears
the
elements
of
the
story
in
genesis
the
primal
eden
the
tempter
in
animal
form
and
the
bringing
of
sorrow
and
death
upon
earth
through
the
elemental
sins
of
envy
and
jealousy
the
warning
conveyed
in
the
story
of
was
ever
used
with
success
by
indian
parents
and
especially
grandparents
in
the
instruction
of
their
children
on
the
other
hand
was
a
demigod
and
mysterious
teacher
whose
function
it
was
to
initiate
the
first
man
into
his
tasks
and
pleasures
here
on
earth
after
the
battle
with
the
animals
there
followed
a
battle
with
the
elements
which
in
some
measure
parallels
the
old
testament
story
of
the
flood
in
this
case
the
purpose
seems
to
have
been
to
destroy
the
wicked
animal
people
who
were
too
many
and
too
strong
for
the
lone
man
the
legend
tells
us
that
when
fall
came
the
advised
his
younger
brother
to
make
for
himself
a
warm
tent
of
buffalo
skins
and
to
store
up
much
food
no
sooner
had
he
done
this
than
it
began
to
snow
and
the
snow
fell
steadily
during
many
moons
the
little
boy
man
made
for
himself
and
was
thus
enabled
to
hunt
easily
while
the
animals
fled
from
him
with
difficulty
finally
wolves
foxes
and
ravens
came
to
his
door
to
beg
for
food
and
he
helped
them
but
many
of
the
fiercer
wild
animals
died
of
cold
and
starvation
one
day
when
the
hungry
ones
appeared
the
snow
was
higher
than
the
tops
of
the
teepee
poles
but
the
little
boy
man
s
fire
kept
a
hole
open
and
clear
down
this
hole
they
peered
and
lo
the
man
had
rubbed
ashes
on
his
face
by
the
advice
of
his
elder
brother
and
they
both
lay
silent
and
motionless
on
either
side
of
the
fire
then
the
fox
barked
and
the
raven
cawed
his
signal
to
the
wandering
tribes
and
they
all
rejoiced
and
said
now
they
are
both
dying
or
dead
and
we
shall
have
no
more
trouble
but
the
sun
appeared
and
a
warm
wind
melted
the
so
that
the
land
was
full
of
water
the
young
man
and
his
teacher
made
a
canoe
which
floated
upon
the
surface
of
the
flood
while
of
the
animals
there
were
saved
only
a
few
who
had
found
a
foothold
upon
the
highest
peaks
the
youth
had
now
passed
triumphantly
through
the
various
ordeals
of
his
manhood
one
day
his
elder
brother
spoke
to
him
and
said
you
have
now
conquered
the
animal
people
and
withstood
the
force
of
the
elements
you
have
subdued
the
earth
to
your
will
and
still
you
are
alone
it
is
time
to
go
forth
and
find
a
woman
whom
you
can
love
and
by
whose
help
you
may
reproduce
your
but
how
am
i
to
do
this
replied
the
first
man
who
was
only
an
inexperienced
boy
i
am
here
alone
as
you
say
and
i
know
not
where
to
find
a
woman
or
a
mate
go
forth
and
seek
her
replied
the
great
teacher
and
forthwith
the
youth
set
out
on
his
wanderings
in
search
of
a
wife
he
had
no
idea
how
to
make
love
so
that
the
first
courtship
was
done
by
the
pretty
and
coquettish
maidens
of
the
bird
beaver
and
bear
tribes
there
are
some
touching
and
whimsical
love
stories
which
the
rich
imagination
of
the
indian
has
woven
into
this
old
legend
it
is
said
for
example
that
at
his
first
camp
he
had
built
for
himself
a
lodge
of
green
boughs
in
the
midst
of
the
forest
and
that
there
his
reverie
was
interrupted
by
a
voice
from
the
wilderness
a
voice
that
was
irresistibly
and
profoundly
sweet
in
some
mysterious
way
the
soul
of
the
young
man
was
touched
as
it
had
never
been
before
for
this
call
of
exquisite
tenderness
and
allurement
was
the
voice
of
the
eternal
woman
presently
a
charming
little
girl
stood
timidly
at
the
door
of
his
wigwam
she
was
modestly
dressed
in
gray
with
a
touch
of
jet
about
her
pretty
face
and
she
carried
a
basket
of
wild
cherries
which
she
shyly
offered
to
the
young
man
so
the
rover
was
subdued
and
love
turned
loose
upon
the
world
to
upbuild
and
to
destroy
when
at
last
she
left
him
he
peeped
through
the
door
after
her
but
saw
only
a
robin
with
head
turned
archly
to
one
side
fluttering
away
among
the
trees
his
next
camp
was
beside
a
clear
running
stream
where
a
plump
and
industrious
maid
was
busily
at
work
chopping
wood
he
fell
promptly
in
love
with
her
also
and
for
some
time
they
lived
together
in
her
cosy
house
by
the
waterside
after
their
boy
was
born
the
wanderer
wished
very
much
to
go
back
to
his
elder
brother
and
to
show
him
his
wife
and
child
but
the
refused
to
go
so
at
last
he
went
alone
for
a
short
visit
when
he
returned
there
was
only
a
trickle
of
water
beside
the
broken
dam
the
beautiful
home
was
left
desolate
and
wife
and
child
were
gone
forever
the
deserted
husband
sat
alone
upon
the
bank
sleepless
and
faint
with
grief
until
he
was
consoled
by
a
comely
young
woman
in
glossy
black
who
took
compassion
upon
his
distress
and
soothed
him
with
food
and
loving
attentions
this
was
the
from
whom
again
he
was
afterward
separated
by
some
mishap
the
story
goes
that
he
had
children
by
each
of
his
many
wives
some
of
whom
resembled
their
father
and
these
became
the
ancestors
of
the
human
race
while
those
who
bore
the
characteristics
of
their
mother
returned
to
her
clan
it
is
also
said
that
such
as
were
abnormal
or
monstrous
in
form
were
forbidden
to
reproduce
their
kind
and
all
love
and
mating
between
man
and
the
animal
creation
was
from
that
time
forth
strictly
prohibited
there
are
some
curious
traditions
of
young
men
and
maidens
who
transgressed
this
law
unknowingly
being
seduced
and
deceived
by
a
magnificent
buck
deer
perhaps
or
a
graceful
doe
and
whose
fall
was
punished
with
death
the
animal
totems
so
general
among
the
tribes
were
said
to
have
descended
to
them
from
their
s
clan
and
the
legend
was
often
quoted
in
support
of
our
close
friendship
with
the
animal
people
i
have
sometimes
wondered
why
the
scientific
doctrine
of
man
s
descent
has
not
in
the
same
way
apparently
increased
the
white
man
s
respect
for
these
our
humbler
kin
of
the
many
later
heroes
or
hiawathas
who
appear
in
this
voluminous
unwritten
book
of
ours
each
introduced
an
epoch
in
the
long
story
of
man
and
his
environment
there
is
for
example
the
avenger
of
the
innocent
who
sprang
from
a
clot
of
blood
the
ragged
little
boy
who
won
fame
and
a
wife
by
shooting
the
red
eagle
of
fateful
omen
and
the
star
boy
who
was
the
of
a
mortal
maiden
and
a
star
it
was
this
last
who
fought
for
man
against
his
strongest
enemies
such
as
wazeeyah
the
cold
or
there
was
a
desperate
battle
between
these
two
in
which
first
one
had
the
advantage
and
then
the
other
until
both
were
exhausted
and
declared
a
truce
while
he
rested
star
boy
continued
to
fan
himself
with
his
great
fan
of
eagle
feathers
and
the
snow
melted
so
fast
that
was
forced
to
arrange
a
treaty
of
peace
by
which
he
was
only
to
control
one
half
the
year
so
it
was
that
the
orderly
march
of
the
seasons
was
established
and
every
year
star
boy
with
his
fan
of
eagle
feathers
sets
in
motion
the
warm
winds
that
usher
in
the
spring
vi
on
the
of
spirits
death
and
funeral
customs
the
sacred
lock
of
hair
reincarnation
and
the
converse
of
spirits
occult
and
psychic
powers
the
gift
of
prophecy
the
attitude
of
the
indian
toward
death
the
test
and
background
of
life
is
entirely
consistent
with
his
character
and
philosophy
death
has
no
terrors
for
him
he
meets
it
with
simplicity
and
perfect
calm
seeking
only
an
honorable
end
as
his
last
gift
to
his
family
and
descendants
therefore
he
courts
death
in
battle
on
the
other
hand
he
would
regard
it
as
disgraceful
to
be
killed
in
a
private
quarrel
if
one
be
dying
at
home
it
is
customary
to
carry
his
bed
out
of
doors
as
the
end
approaches
that
his
spirit
may
pass
under
the
open
sky
next
to
this
the
matter
that
concerns
him
most
is
the
parting
with
his
dear
ones
especially
if
he
have
any
little
children
who
must
be
left
behind
to
suffer
want
his
family
affections
are
strong
and
he
grieves
intensely
for
the
lost
even
though
he
has
unbounded
faith
in
a
spiritual
companionship
the
outward
signs
of
mourning
for
the
dead
are
far
more
spontaneous
and
convincing
than
is
the
correct
and
black
of
civilization
both
men
and
women
among
us
loosen
their
hair
and
cut
it
according
to
the
degree
of
relationship
or
of
devotion
consistent
with
the
idea
of
sacrificing
all
personal
beauty
and
adornment
they
trim
off
likewise
from
the
dress
its
fringes
and
ornaments
perhaps
cut
it
short
or
cut
the
robe
or
blanket
in
two
the
men
blacken
their
faces
and
widows
or
bereaved
parents
sometimes
gash
their
arms
and
legs
till
they
are
covered
with
blood
giving
themselves
up
wholly
to
their
grief
they
are
no
longer
concerned
about
any
earthly
possession
and
often
give
away
all
that
they
have
to
the
first
comers
even
to
their
beds
and
their
home
finally
the
wailing
for
the
dead
is
continued
night
and
day
to
the
point
of
utter
voicelessness
a
musical
weird
and
sound
which
has
been
compared
to
the
keening
of
the
celtic
mourner
the
burial
of
the
plains
indians
was
upon
a
scaffold
of
poles
or
a
platform
among
the
boughs
of
a
tree
their
only
means
of
placing
the
body
out
of
reach
of
wild
beasts
as
they
had
no
implements
with
which
to
dig
a
suitable
grave
it
was
prepared
by
dressing
in
the
finest
clothes
together
with
some
personal
possessions
and
ornaments
wrapped
in
several
robes
and
finally
in
a
secure
covering
of
as
a
special
mark
of
respect
the
body
of
a
young
woman
or
a
warrior
was
sometimes
laid
out
in
state
in
a
new
teepee
with
the
usual
household
articles
and
even
with
a
dish
of
food
left
beside
it
not
that
they
supposed
the
spirit
could
use
the
implements
or
eat
the
food
but
merely
as
a
last
tribute
then
the
whole
people
would
break
camp
and
depart
to
a
distance
leaving
the
dead
alone
in
an
honorable
solitude
there
was
no
prescribed
ceremony
of
burial
though
the
body
was
carried
out
with
more
or
less
solemnity
by
selected
young
men
and
sometimes
noted
warriors
were
the
of
a
man
of
distinction
it
was
usual
to
choose
a
prominent
hill
with
a
commanding
outlook
for
the
last
of
our
dead
if
a
man
were
slain
in
battle
it
was
an
old
custom
to
place
his
body
against
a
tree
or
rock
in
a
sitting
position
always
facing
the
enemy
to
indicate
his
undaunted
defiance
and
bravery
even
in
death
i
recall
a
touching
custom
among
us
which
was
designed
to
keep
the
memory
of
the
departed
near
and
warm
in
the
bereaved
household
a
lock
of
hair
of
the
beloved
dead
was
wrapped
in
pretty
clothing
such
as
it
was
supposed
that
he
or
she
would
like
to
wear
if
living
this
spirit
bundle
as
it
was
called
was
suspended
from
a
tripod
and
occupied
a
certain
place
in
the
lodge
which
was
the
place
of
honor
at
every
meal
time
a
dish
of
food
was
placed
under
it
and
some
person
of
the
same
sex
and
age
as
the
one
who
was
gone
must
afterward
be
invited
in
to
partake
of
the
food
at
the
end
of
a
year
from
the
time
of
death
the
relatives
made
a
public
feast
and
gave
away
the
clothing
and
other
gifts
while
the
lock
of
hair
was
interred
with
appropriate
ceremonies
certainly
the
indian
never
doubted
the
immortal
nature
of
the
spirit
or
soul
of
man
but
neither
did
he
care
to
speculate
upon
its
probable
state
or
condition
in
a
future
life
the
idea
of
a
happy
is
modern
and
probably
borrowed
or
invented
by
the
white
man
the
primitive
indian
was
content
to
believe
that
the
spirit
which
the
great
mystery
breathed
into
man
returns
to
him
who
gave
it
and
that
after
it
is
freed
from
the
body
it
is
everywhere
and
pervades
all
nature
yet
often
lingers
near
the
grave
or
spirit
bundle
for
the
consolation
of
friends
and
is
able
to
hear
prayers
so
much
of
reverence
was
due
the
disembodied
spirit
that
it
was
not
customary
with
us
even
to
name
the
dead
aloud
it
is
well
known
that
the
american
indian
had
somehow
developed
occult
power
and
although
in
the
latter
days
there
have
been
many
impostors
and
allowing
for
the
vanity
and
weakness
of
human
nature
it
is
fair
to
assume
that
there
must
have
been
some
even
in
the
old
days
yet
there
are
instances
of
remarkable
prophecies
and
other
mystic
practice
a
sioux
prophet
predicted
the
coming
of
the
white
man
fully
fifty
years
before
the
event
and
even
described
accurately
his
garments
and
weapons
before
the
steamboat
was
invented
another
prophet
of
our
race
described
the
fire
boat
that
would
swim
upon
their
mighty
river
the
mississippi
and
the
date
of
this
prophecy
is
attested
by
the
term
used
which
is
long
since
obsolete
no
doubt
many
predictions
have
been
colored
to
suit
the
new
age
and
unquestionably
false
prophets
fakirs
and
conjurers
have
become
the
pest
of
the
tribes
during
the
transition
period
nevertheless
even
during
this
period
there
was
here
and
there
a
man
of
the
old
type
who
was
implicitly
believed
in
to
the
last
notable
among
these
was
or
his
war
club
speaks
loud
who
foretold
a
year
in
advance
the
details
of
a
great
against
the
ojibways
there
were
to
be
seven
battles
all
successful
except
the
last
in
which
the
sioux
were
to
be
taken
at
a
disadvantage
and
suffer
crushing
defeat
this
was
carried
out
to
the
letter
our
people
surprised
and
slew
many
of
the
ojibways
in
their
villages
but
in
turn
were
followed
and
cunningly
led
into
an
ambush
whence
but
few
came
out
alive
this
was
only
one
of
his
remarkable
prophecies
another
famous
was
born
on
the
rum
river
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
and
lived
to
be
over
a
century
old
he
was
born
during
a
desperate
battle
with
the
ojibways
at
a
moment
when
as
it
seemed
the
band
of
sioux
engaged
were
to
be
annihilated
therefore
the
child
s
grandmother
exclaimed
since
we
are
all
to
perish
let
him
die
a
warrior
s
death
in
the
field
and
she
placed
his
cradle
under
fire
near
the
spot
where
his
uncle
and
grandfathers
were
fighting
for
he
had
no
father
but
when
an
old
man
discovered
the
child
he
commanded
the
women
to
take
care
of
him
for
said
he
we
know
not
how
precious
the
strength
of
even
one
warrior
may
some
day
become
to
his
nation
this
child
lived
to
become
great
among
us
as
was
intimated
to
the
superstitious
by
the
circumstances
of
his
birth
at
the
age
of
about
years
he
saved
his
band
from
utter
destruction
at
the
hands
of
their
ancestral
enemies
by
suddenly
giving
warning
received
in
a
dream
of
the
approach
of
a
large
the
men
immediately
sent
out
scouts
and
felled
trees
for
a
stockade
barely
in
time
to
meet
and
repel
the
predicted
attack
five
years
later
he
repeated
the
service
and
again
saved
his
people
from
awful
slaughter
there
was
no
confusion
of
figures
or
omens
as
with
lesser
but
in
every
incident
that
is
told
of
him
his
interpretation
of
the
sign
whatever
it
was
proved
singularly
correct
the
father
of
little
crow
the
chief
who
led
the
minnesota
massacre
of
was
another
prophet
of
some
note
one
of
his
characteristic
prophecies
was
made
only
a
few
years
before
he
died
when
he
had
declared
that
although
already
an
old
man
he
would
go
once
more
upon
the
at
the
final
he
declared
that
three
of
the
enemy
would
be
slain
but
he
showed
great
distress
and
reluctance
in
foretelling
that
he
would
lose
two
of
his
own
men
three
of
the
ojibways
were
indeed
slain
as
he
had
said
but
in
the
battle
the
old
war
prophet
lost
both
of
his
two
sons
there
are
many
trustworthy
men
and
men
of
christian
faith
to
vouch
for
these
and
similar
events
occurring
as
foretold
i
can
not
pretend
to
explain
them
but
i
know
that
our
people
possessed
remarkable
powers
of
concentration
and
abstraction
and
i
sometimes
fancy
that
such
nearness
to
nature
as
i
have
described
keeps
the
spirit
sensitive
to
impressions
not
commonly
felt
and
in
touch
with
the
unseen
powers
some
of
us
seemed
to
have
a
peculiar
intuition
for
the
locality
of
a
grave
which
they
explained
by
saying
that
they
had
received
a
communication
from
the
spirit
of
the
departed
my
own
grandmother
was
one
of
these
and
as
far
back
as
i
can
remember
when
camping
in
a
strange
country
my
brother
and
i
would
search
for
and
find
human
bones
at
the
spot
she
had
indicated
to
us
as
an
ancient
or
the
spot
where
a
lone
warrior
had
fallen
of
course
the
outward
signs
of
burial
had
been
long
since
obliterated
the
scotch
would
certainly
have
declared
that
she
had
the
second
sight
for
she
had
other
remarkable
premonitions
or
intuitions
within
my
own
recollection
i
have
heard
her
speak
of
a
peculiar
sensation
in
the
breast
by
which
as
she
said
she
was
advised
of
anything
of
importance
concerning
her
absent
children
other
native
women
have
claimed
a
similar
monitor
but
i
never
heard
of
one
who
could
interpret
it
with
such
accuracy
we
were
once
camping
on
lake
manitoba
when
we
received
news
that
my
uncle
and
his
family
had
been
murdered
several
weeks
before
at
a
fort
some
two
hundred
miles
distant
while
all
our
clan
were
wailing
and
mourning
their
loss
my
grandmother
calmly
bade
them
cease
saying
that
her
son
was
approaching
and
that
they
would
see
him
shortly
although
we
had
no
other
reason
to
doubt
the
ill
tidings
it
is
a
fact
that
my
uncle
came
into
camp
two
days
after
his
reported
death
at
another
time
when
i
was
fourteen
years
old
we
had
just
left
fort
ellis
on
the
assiniboine
river
and
my
youngest
uncle
had
selected
a
fine
spot
for
our
night
camp
it
was
already
after
sundown
but
my
grandmother
became
unaccountably
nervous
and
positively
refused
to
pitch
her
tent
so
we
reluctantly
went
on
down
the
river
and
camped
after
dark
at
a
secluded
place
the
next
day
we
learned
that
a
family
who
were
following
close
behind
had
stopped
at
the
place
first
selected
by
my
uncle
but
were
surprised
in
the
night
by
a
roving
and
massacred
to
a
man
this
incident
made
a
great
impression
upon
our
people
many
of
the
indians
believed
that
one
may
be
born
more
than
once
and
there
were
some
who
claimed
to
have
full
knowledge
of
a
former
incarnation
there
were
also
those
who
held
converse
with
a
twin
spirit
who
had
been
born
into
another
tribe
or
race
there
was
a
sioux
who
lived
in
the
middle
of
the
last
century
so
that
he
is
still
remembered
by
the
old
men
of
his
band
after
he
had
reached
middle
age
he
declared
that
he
had
a
spirit
brother
among
the
ojibways
the
ancestral
enemies
of
the
sioux
he
even
named
the
band
to
which
his
brother
belonged
and
said
that
he
also
was
a
among
his
people
upon
one
of
their
hunts
along
the
border
between
the
two
tribes
the
sioux
leader
one
evening
called
his
warriors
together
and
solemnly
declared
to
them
that
they
were
about
to
meet
a
like
band
of
ojibway
hunters
led
by
his
spirit
twin
since
this
was
to
be
their
first
meeting
since
they
were
born
as
strangers
he
earnestly
begged
the
young
men
to
resist
the
temptation
to
join
battle
with
their
tribal
foes
you
will
know
him
at
once
the
prophet
said
to
them
for
he
will
not
only
look
like
me
in
face
and
form
but
he
will
display
the
same
totem
and
even
sing
my
war
songs
they
sent
out
scouts
who
soon
returned
with
news
of
the
approaching
party
then
the
leading
men
started
with
their
for
the
ojibway
camp
and
when
they
were
near
at
hand
they
fired
three
distinct
volleys
a
signal
of
their
desire
for
a
peaceful
meeting
the
response
came
in
like
manner
and
they
entered
the
camp
with
the
in
the
hands
of
the
prophet
lo
the
stranger
prophet
advanced
to
meet
them
and
the
people
were
greatly
struck
with
the
resemblance
between
the
two
men
who
met
and
embraced
one
another
with
unusual
fervor
it
was
quickly
agreed
by
both
parties
that
they
should
camp
together
for
several
days
and
one
evening
the
sioux
made
a
warriors
feast
to
which
they
invited
many
of
the
ojibways
the
prophet
asked
his
twin
brother
to
sing
one
of
his
sacred
songs
and
behold
it
was
the
very
song
that
he
himself
was
wont
to
sing
this
proved
to
the
warriors
beyond
doubt
or
cavil
the
claims
of
their
seer
