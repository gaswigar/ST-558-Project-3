among
all
the
pupils
of
the
oratorian
school
at
vendome
we
are
i
think
the
only
two
who
have
afterwards
met
in
of
a
life
of
letters
we
who
once
were
cultivating
philosophy
when
by
rights
we
should
have
been
minding
our
de
viris
when
we
met
you
were
engaged
upon
your
noble
works
on
german
philosophy
and
i
upon
this
study
so
neither
of
us
has
missed
his
vocation
and
you
when
you
see
your
name
here
will
feel
no
doubt
as
much
pleasure
as
he
who
inscribes
his
work
to
your
old
schoolfellow
de
balzac
gobseck
it
was
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
during
the
winter
of
but
in
the
vicomtesse
de
grandlieu
s
salon
two
persons
stayed
on
who
did
not
belong
to
her
family
circle
a
young
and
man
heard
the
clock
strike
and
took
his
leave
when
the
courtyard
echoed
with
the
sound
of
a
departing
carriage
the
vicomtesse
looked
up
saw
that
no
one
was
present
save
her
brother
and
a
friend
of
the
family
finishing
their
game
of
piquet
and
went
across
to
her
daughter
the
girl
standing
by
the
apparently
examining
a
transparent
was
listening
to
the
sounds
from
the
courtyard
in
a
way
that
justified
certain
maternal
fears
camille
said
the
vicomtesse
if
you
continue
to
behave
to
young
comte
de
restaud
as
you
have
done
this
evening
you
will
oblige
me
to
see
no
more
of
him
here
listen
child
and
if
you
have
any
confidence
in
my
love
let
me
guide
you
in
life
at
seventeen
one
can
not
judge
of
past
or
future
nor
of
certain
social
considerations
i
have
only
one
thing
to
say
to
you
de
restaud
has
a
mother
a
mother
who
would
waste
millions
of
francs
a
woman
of
no
birth
a
mlle
goriot
people
talked
a
good
deal
about
her
at
one
time
she
behaved
so
badly
to
her
own
father
that
she
certainly
does
not
deserve
to
have
so
good
a
son
the
young
count
adores
her
and
maintains
her
in
her
position
with
dutifulness
worthy
of
all
praise
and
he
is
extremely
good
to
his
brother
and
but
however
admirable
behavior
may
be
the
vicomtesse
added
with
a
shrewd
expression
so
long
as
his
mother
lives
any
family
would
take
alarm
at
the
idea
of
intrusting
a
daughter
s
fortune
and
future
to
young
i
overheard
a
word
now
and
again
in
your
talk
with
mlle
de
grandlieu
cried
the
friend
of
the
family
and
it
made
me
anxious
to
put
in
a
word
of
my
i
have
won
le
comte
he
added
turning
to
his
opponent
i
shall
throw
you
over
and
go
to
your
niece
s
see
what
it
is
to
have
an
attorney
s
ears
exclaimed
the
vicomtesse
my
dear
derville
how
could
you
know
what
i
was
saying
to
camille
in
a
whisper
i
knew
it
from
your
looks
answered
derville
seating
himself
in
a
low
chair
by
the
fire
camille
s
uncle
went
to
her
side
and
mme
de
grandlieu
took
up
her
position
on
a
hearth
stool
between
her
daughter
and
derville
the
time
has
come
for
telling
a
story
which
should
modify
your
judgment
as
to
ernest
de
restaud
s
a
story
cried
camille
do
begin
at
once
the
glance
that
derville
gave
the
vicomtesse
told
her
that
this
tale
was
meant
for
her
the
vicomtesse
de
grandlieu
be
it
said
was
one
of
the
greatest
ladies
in
the
faubourg
by
reason
of
her
fortune
and
her
ancient
name
and
though
it
may
seem
improbable
that
a
paris
attorney
should
speak
so
familiarly
to
her
or
be
so
much
at
home
in
her
house
the
fact
is
nevertheless
easily
explained
when
mme
de
grandlieu
returned
to
france
with
the
royal
family
she
came
to
paris
and
at
first
lived
entirely
on
the
pension
allowed
her
out
of
the
civil
list
by
louis
an
intolerable
position
the
hotel
de
grandlieu
had
been
sold
by
the
republic
it
came
to
derville
s
knowledge
that
there
were
flaws
in
the
title
and
he
thought
that
it
ought
to
return
to
the
vicomtesse
he
instituted
proceedings
for
nullity
of
contract
and
gained
the
day
encouraged
by
this
success
he
used
legal
quibbles
to
such
purpose
that
he
compelled
some
institution
or
other
to
disgorge
the
forest
of
liceney
then
he
won
certain
lawsuits
against
the
canal
d
orleans
and
recovered
a
tolerably
large
amount
of
property
with
which
the
emperor
had
endowed
various
public
institutions
so
it
fell
out
that
thanks
to
the
young
attorney
s
skilful
management
mme
de
grandlieu
s
income
reached
the
sum
of
some
sixty
thousand
francs
to
say
nothing
of
the
vast
sums
returned
to
her
by
the
law
of
indemnity
and
derville
a
man
of
high
character
well
informed
modest
and
pleasant
in
company
became
the
of
the
family
by
his
conduct
of
mme
de
grandlieu
s
affairs
he
had
fairly
earned
the
esteem
of
the
faubourg
and
numbered
the
best
families
among
his
clients
but
he
did
not
take
advantage
of
his
popularity
as
an
ambitious
man
might
have
done
the
vicomtesse
would
have
had
him
sell
his
practice
and
enter
the
magistracy
in
which
career
advancement
would
have
been
swift
and
certain
with
such
influence
at
his
disposal
but
he
persistently
refused
all
offers
he
only
went
into
society
to
keep
up
his
connections
but
he
occasionally
spent
an
evening
at
the
hotel
de
grandlieu
it
was
a
very
lucky
thing
for
him
that
his
talents
had
been
brought
into
the
light
by
his
devotion
to
mme
de
grandlieu
for
his
practice
otherwise
might
have
gone
to
pieces
derville
had
not
an
attorney
s
soul
since
ernest
de
restaud
had
appeared
at
the
hotel
de
grandlieu
and
he
had
noticed
that
camille
felt
attracted
to
the
young
man
derville
had
been
as
assiduous
in
his
visits
as
any
dandy
of
the
antin
newly
admitted
to
the
noble
faubourg
at
a
ball
only
a
few
days
before
when
he
happened
to
stand
near
camille
and
said
indicating
the
count
it
is
a
pity
that
yonder
youngster
has
not
two
or
three
million
francs
is
it
not
is
it
a
pity
i
do
not
think
so
the
girl
answered
m
de
restaud
has
plenty
of
ability
he
is
well
educated
and
the
minister
his
chief
thinks
well
of
him
he
will
be
a
remarkable
man
i
have
no
doubt
yonder
youngster
will
have
as
much
money
as
he
wishes
when
he
comes
into
yes
but
suppose
that
he
were
rich
already
rich
already
repeated
camille
flushing
red
why
all
the
girls
in
the
room
would
be
quarreling
for
him
she
said
glancing
at
the
quadrilles
and
then
retorted
the
attorney
mlle
de
grandlieu
might
not
be
the
one
towards
whom
his
eyes
are
always
turned
that
is
what
that
red
color
means
you
like
him
do
you
not
come
speak
camille
suddenly
rose
to
go
she
loves
him
derville
thought
since
that
evening
camille
had
been
unwontedly
attentive
to
the
attorney
who
approved
of
her
liking
for
ernest
de
restaud
hitherto
although
she
knew
well
that
her
family
lay
under
great
obligations
to
derville
she
had
felt
respect
rather
than
real
friendship
for
him
their
relation
was
more
a
matter
of
politeness
than
of
warmth
of
feeling
and
by
her
manner
and
by
the
tones
of
her
voice
she
had
always
made
him
sensible
of
the
distance
which
socially
lay
between
them
gratitude
is
a
charge
upon
the
inheritance
which
the
second
generation
is
apt
to
repudiate
this
adventure
derville
began
after
a
pause
brings
the
one
romantic
event
in
my
life
to
my
mind
you
are
laughing
already
he
went
on
it
seems
so
ridiculous
doesn
t
it
that
an
attorney
should
speak
of
a
romance
in
his
life
but
once
i
was
like
everybody
else
and
even
then
i
had
seen
some
queer
things
i
ought
to
begin
at
the
beginning
by
telling
you
about
some
one
whom
it
is
impossible
that
you
should
have
known
the
man
in
question
was
a
usurer
can
you
grasp
a
clear
notion
of
that
sallow
wan
face
of
his
i
wish
the
would
give
me
leave
to
dub
such
faces
the
type
it
was
like
with
the
gilt
rubbed
off
his
hair
was
sleek
and
carefully
combed
his
features
might
have
been
cast
in
bronze
talleyrand
himself
was
not
more
impassive
than
this
a
pair
of
little
eyes
yellow
as
a
ferret
s
and
with
scarce
an
eyelash
to
them
peered
out
from
under
the
sheltering
peak
of
a
shabby
old
cap
as
if
they
feared
the
light
he
had
the
thin
lips
that
you
see
in
rembrandt
s
or
metsu
s
portraits
of
alchemists
and
shrunken
old
men
and
a
nose
so
sharp
at
the
tip
that
it
put
you
in
mind
of
a
gimlet
his
voice
was
so
low
he
always
spoke
suavely
he
never
flew
into
a
passion
his
age
was
a
problem
it
was
hard
to
say
whether
he
had
grown
old
before
his
time
or
whether
by
economy
of
youth
he
had
saved
enough
to
last
him
his
life
his
room
and
everything
in
it
from
the
green
baize
of
the
bureau
to
the
strip
of
carpet
by
the
bed
was
as
clean
and
threadbare
as
the
chilly
sanctuary
of
some
elderly
spinster
who
spends
her
days
in
rubbing
her
furniture
in
winter
time
the
live
brands
of
the
fire
smouldered
all
day
in
a
bank
of
ashes
there
was
never
any
flame
in
his
grate
he
went
through
his
day
from
his
uprising
to
his
evening
with
the
regularity
of
a
pendulum
and
in
some
sort
was
a
clockwork
man
wound
up
by
a
night
s
slumber
touch
a
on
an
excursion
across
your
sheet
of
paper
and
the
creature
shams
death
and
in
something
the
same
way
my
acquaintance
would
stop
short
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
while
a
cart
went
by
to
save
the
strain
to
his
voice
following
the
example
of
fontenelle
he
was
thrifty
of
and
concentrated
all
human
sensibility
in
the
innermost
sanctuary
of
self
his
life
flowed
soundless
as
the
sands
of
an
his
victims
sometimes
flew
into
a
rage
and
made
a
great
deal
of
noise
followed
by
a
great
silence
so
is
it
in
a
kitchen
after
a
fowl
s
neck
has
been
wrung
toward
evening
this
bill
of
exchange
incarnate
would
assume
ordinary
human
shape
and
his
metals
were
metamorphosed
into
a
human
heart
when
he
was
satisfied
with
his
day
s
business
he
would
rub
his
hands
his
inward
glee
would
escape
like
smoke
through
every
rift
and
wrinkle
of
his
face
in
no
other
way
is
it
possible
to
give
an
idea
of
the
mute
play
of
muscle
which
expressed
sensations
similar
to
the
soundless
laughter
of
indeed
even
in
transports
of
joy
his
conversation
was
confined
to
monosyllables
he
wore
the
same
countenance
this
was
the
neighbor
chance
found
for
me
in
the
house
in
the
rue
de
gres
where
i
used
to
live
when
as
yet
i
was
only
a
second
clerk
finishing
my
third
year
s
studies
the
house
is
damp
and
dark
and
boasts
no
courtyard
all
the
windows
look
on
the
street
the
whole
dwelling
in
claustral
fashion
is
divided
into
rooms
or
cells
of
equal
size
all
opening
upon
a
long
corridor
dimly
lit
with
borrowed
lights
the
place
must
have
been
part
of
an
old
convent
once
so
gloomy
was
it
that
the
gaiety
of
eldest
sons
forsook
them
on
the
stairs
before
they
reached
my
neighbor
s
door
he
and
his
house
were
much
alike
even
so
does
the
oyster
resemble
his
native
rock
i
was
the
one
creature
with
whom
he
had
any
communication
socially
speaking
he
would
come
in
to
ask
for
a
light
to
borrow
a
book
or
a
newspaper
and
of
an
evening
he
would
allow
me
to
go
into
his
cell
and
when
he
was
in
the
humor
we
would
chat
together
these
marks
of
confidence
were
the
results
of
four
years
of
neighborhood
and
my
own
sober
conduct
from
sheer
lack
of
pence
i
was
bound
to
live
pretty
much
as
he
did
had
he
any
relations
or
friends
was
he
rich
or
poor
nobody
could
give
an
answer
to
these
questions
i
myself
never
saw
money
in
his
room
doubtless
his
capital
was
safely
stowed
in
the
strong
rooms
of
the
bank
he
used
to
collect
his
bills
himself
as
they
fell
due
running
all
over
paris
on
a
pair
of
shanks
as
skinny
as
a
stag
s
on
occasion
he
would
be
a
martyr
to
prudence
one
day
when
he
happened
to
have
gold
in
his
pockets
a
double
napoleon
worked
its
way
somehow
or
other
out
of
his
fob
and
fell
and
another
lodger
following
him
up
the
stairs
picked
up
the
coin
and
returned
it
to
its
owner
that
isn
t
mine
said
he
with
a
start
of
surprise
mine
indeed
if
i
were
rich
should
i
live
as
i
do
he
made
his
cup
of
coffee
himself
every
morning
on
the
chafing
dish
which
stood
all
day
in
the
black
angle
of
the
grate
his
dinner
came
in
from
a
cookshop
and
our
old
porter
s
wife
went
up
at
the
prescribed
hour
to
set
his
room
in
order
finally
a
whimsical
chance
in
which
sterne
would
have
seen
predestination
had
named
the
man
gobseck
when
i
did
business
for
him
later
i
came
to
know
that
he
was
about
years
old
at
the
time
when
we
became
acquainted
he
was
born
about
in
some
outlying
suburb
of
antwerp
of
a
dutch
father
and
a
jewish
mother
and
his
name
was
van
gobseck
you
remember
how
all
paris
took
an
interest
in
that
murder
case
a
woman
named
belle
i
happened
to
mention
it
to
my
old
neighbor
and
he
answered
without
the
slightest
symptom
of
interest
or
surprise
she
is
my
that
was
the
only
remark
drawn
from
him
by
the
death
of
his
sole
surviving
next
of
kin
his
sister
s
granddaughter
from
reports
of
the
case
i
found
that
belle
was
in
fact
named
sara
van
gobseck
when
i
asked
by
what
curious
chance
his
grandniece
came
to
bear
his
surname
he
smiled
the
women
never
marry
in
our
singular
creature
he
had
never
cared
to
find
out
a
single
relative
among
four
generations
counted
on
the
female
side
the
thought
of
his
heirs
was
abhorrent
to
him
and
the
idea
that
his
wealth
could
pass
into
other
hands
after
his
death
simply
inconceivable
he
was
a
child
ten
years
old
when
his
mother
shipped
him
off
as
a
cabin
boy
on
a
voyage
to
the
dutch
straits
settlements
and
there
he
knocked
about
for
twenty
years
the
inscrutable
lines
on
that
sallow
forehead
kept
the
secret
of
horrible
adventures
sudden
panic
luck
romantic
cross
events
joys
that
knew
no
limit
hunger
endured
and
love
trampled
under
foot
fortunes
risked
lost
and
recovered
life
endangered
time
and
time
again
and
saved
it
may
be
by
one
of
the
rapid
ruthless
decisions
absolved
by
necessity
he

did
so
much
to
found
the
power
of
the
mahrattas
had
had
dealings
with
gobseck
long
residence
at
thomas
brought
him
in
contact
with
victor
hughes
and
other
notorious
pirates
in
his
quest
of
fortune
he
had
left
no
stone
unturned
witness
an
attempt
to
discover
the
treasure
of
that
tribe
of
savages
so
famous
in
buenos
ayres
and
its
neighborhood
he
had
a
personal
knowledge
of
the
events
of
the
american
war
of
independence
but
if
he
spoke
of
the
indies
or
of

as
he
did
very
rarely
with
me
and
never
with
anyone
else
he
seemed
to
regard
it
as
an
indiscretion
and
to
repent
of
it
afterwards
if
humanity
and
sociability
are
in
some
sort
a
religion
gobseck
might
be
ranked
as
an
infidel
but
though
i
set
myself
to
study
him
i
must
confess
to
my
shame
that
his
real
nature
was
impenetrable
up
to
the
very
last
i
even
felt
doubts
at
times
as
to
his
sex
if
all
usurers
are
like
this
one
i
maintain
that
they
belong
to
the
neuter
gender
did
he
adhere
to
his
mother
s
religion
did
he
look
on
gentiles
as
his
legitimate
prey
had
he
turned
roman
catholic
lutheran
mahometan
brahmin
or
what
not
i
never
knew
anything
whatsoever
about
his
religious
opinions
and
so
far
as
i
could
see
he
was
indifferent
rather
than
incredulous
one
evening
i
went
in
to
see
this
man
who
had
turned
himself
to
gold
the
usurer
whom
his
victims
his
clients
as
he
styled
them
were
wont
to
call
daddy
gobseck
perhaps
ironically
perhaps
by
way
of
antiphrasis
he
was
sitting
in
his
armchair
motionless
as
a
statue
staring
fixedly
at
the
where
he
seemed
to
read
the
figures
of
his
statements
a
lamp
with
a
pedestal
that
had
once
been
green
was
burning
in
the
room
but
so
far
from
taking
color
from
its
smoky
light
his
face
seemed
to
stand
out
positively
paler
against
the
background
he
pointed
to
a
chair
set
for
me
but
not
a
word
did
he
say
what
thoughts
can
this
being
have
in
his
mind
said
i
to
myself
does
he
know
that
a
god
exists
does
he
know
there
are
such
things
as
feeling
woman
happiness
i
pitied
him
as
i
might
have
pitied
a
diseased
creature
but
at
the
same
time
i
knew
quite
well
that
while
he
had
millions
of
francs
at
his
command
he
possessed
the
world
no
less
in
idea
that
world
which
he
had
explored
ransacked
weighed
appraised
and
exploited
good
day
daddy
gobseck
i
began
he
turned
his
face
towards
me
with
a
slight
contraction
of
his
bushy
black
eyebrows
this
characteristic
shade
of
expression
in
him
meant
as
much
as
the
most
jubilant
smile
on
a
southern
face
you
look
just
as
gloomy
as
you
did
that
day
when
the
news
came
of
the
failure
of
that
bookseller
whose
sharpness
you
admired
so
much
though
you
were
one
of
his
one
of
his
victims
he
repeated
with
a
look
of
astonishment
yes
did
you
not
refuse
to
accept
composition
at
the
meeting
of
creditors
until
he
undertook
privately
to
pay
you
your
debt
in
full
and
did
he
not
give
you
bills
accepted
by
the
insolvent
firm
and
then
when
he
set
up
in
business
again
did
he
not
pay
you
the
dividend
upon
those
bills
of
yours
signed
as
they
were
by
the
bankrupt
firm
he
was
a
sharp
one
but
i
had
it
out
of
then
have
you
some
bills
to
protest
is
the
i
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
spoken
to
him
of
money
he
looked
ironically
up
at
me
then
in
those
bland
accents
not
unlike
the
husky
tones
which
the
tyro
draws
from
a
flute
he
answered
i
am
amusing
so
you
amuse
yourself
now
and
again
do
you
imagine
that
the
only
poets
in
the
world
are
those
who
print
their
verses
he
asked
with
a
pitying
look
and
shrug
of
the
shoulders
poetry
in
that
head
thought
i
for
as
yet
i
knew
nothing
of
his
life
what
life
could
be
as
glorious
as
mine
he
continued
and
his
eyes
lighted
up
you
are
young
your
mental
visions
are
colored
by
youthful
blood
you
see
women
s
faces
in
the
fire
while
i
see
nothing
but
coals
in
mine
you
have
all
sorts
of
beliefs
while
i
have
no
beliefs
at
all
keep
your
illusions
if
you
can
now
i
will
show
you
life
with
the
discount
taken
off
go
wherever
you
like
or
stay
at
home
by
the
fireside
with
your
wife
there
always
comes
a
time
when
you
settle
down
in
a
certain
groove
the
groove
is
your
preference
and
then
happiness
consists
in
the
exercise
of
your
faculties
by
applying
them
to
realities
anything
more
in
the
way
of
precept
is
false
my
principles
have
been
various
among
various
men
i
had
to
change
them
with
every
change
of
latitude
things
that
we
admire
in
europe
are
punishable
in
asia
and
a
vice
in
paris
becomes
a
necessity
when
you
have
passed
the
azores
there
are
no
such
things
as
rules
there
are
only
conventions
adapted
to
the
climate
fling
a
man
headlong
into
one
social
melting
pot
after
another
and
convictions
and
forms
and
moral
systems
become
so
many
meaningless
words
to
him
the
one
thing
that
always
remains
the
one
sure
instinct
that
nature
has
implanted
in
us
is
the
instinct
of
if
you
had
lived
as
long
as
i
have
you
would
know
that
there
is
but
one
concrete
reality
invariable
enough
to
be
worth
caring
about
and
that
is
gold
gold
represents
every
form
of
human
power
i
have
traveled
i
found
out
that
there
were
either
hills
or
plains
everywhere
the
plains
are
monotonous
the
hills
a
weariness
consequently
place
may
be
left
out
of
the
question
as
to
manners
man
is
man
all
the
world
over
the
same
battle
between
the
poor
and
the
rich
is
going
on
everywhere
it
is
inevitable
everywhere
consequently
it
is
better
to
exploit
than
to
be
exploited
everywhere
you
find
the
man
of
thews
and
sinews
who
toils
and
the
lymphatic
man
who
torments
himself
and
pleasures
are
everywhere
the
same
for
when
all
sensations
are
exhausted
all
that
survives
is
vanity
vanity
is
the
abiding
substance
of
us
the
in
us
vanity
is
only
to
be
satisfied
by
gold
in
floods
our
dreams
need
time
and
physical
means
and
painstaking
thought
before
they
can
be
realized
well
gold
contains
all
things
in
embryo
gold
realizes
all
things
for
us
none
but
fools
and
invalids
can
find
pleasure
in
shuffling
cards
all
evening
long
to
find
out
whether
they
shall
win
a
few
pence
at
the
end
none
but
driveling
idiots
could
spend
time
in
inquiring
into
all
that
is
happening
around
them
whether
madame
slept
single
on
her
couch
or
in
company
whether
she
has
more
blood
than
lymph
more
temperament
than
virtue
none
but
the
dupes
who
fondly
imagine
that
they
are
useful
to
their
like
can
interest
themselves
in
laying
down
rules
for
political
guidance
amid
events
which
neither
they
nor
any
one
else
foresees
nor
ever
will
foresee
none
but
simpletons
can
delight
in
talking
about
stage
players
and
repeating
their
sayings
making
the
daily
promenade
of
a
caged
animal
over
a
rather
larger
area
dressing
for
others
eating
for
others
priding
themselves
on
a
horse
or
a
carriage
such
as
no
neighbor
can
have
until
three
days
later
what
is
all
this
but
parisian
life
summed
up
in
a
few
phrases
let
us
find
a
higher
outlook
on
life
than
theirs
happiness
consists
either
in
strong
emotions
which
drain
our
vitality
or
in
methodical
occupation
which
makes
existence
like
a
bit
of
english
machinery
working
with
the
regularity
of
clockwork
a
higher
happiness
than
either
consists
in
a
curiosity
styled
noble
a
wish
to
learn
nature
s
secrets
or
to
attempt
by
artificial
means
to
imitate
nature
to
some
extent
what
is
this
in
two
words
but
science
and
art
or
passion
or
calm
ah
well
every
human
passion
wrought
up
to
its
highest
pitch
in
the
struggle
for
existence
comes
to
parade
itself
before
me
as
i
live
in
calm
as
for
your
scientific
curiosity
a
kind
of
wrestling
bout
in
which
man
is
never
uppermost
i
replace
it
by
an
insight
into
all
the
springs
of
action
in
man
and
woman
to
sum
up
the
world
is
mine
without
effort
of
mine
and
the
world
has
not
the
slightest
hold
on
me
listen
to
this
he
went
on
i
will
tell
you
the
history
of
my
morning
and
you
will
divine
my
he
got
up
pushed
the
bolt
of
the
door
drew
a
tapestry
curtain
across
it
with
a
sharp
grating
sound
of
the
rings
on
the
rod
then
he
sat
down
again
this
morning
he
said
i
had
only
two
amounts
to
collect
the
rest
of
the
bills
that
were
due
i
gave
away
instead
of
cash
to
my
customers
yesterday
so
much
saved
you
see
for
when
i
discount
a
bill
i
always
deduct
two
francs
for
a
hired
brougham
expenses
of
collection
a
pretty
thing
it
would
be
would
it
not
if
my
clients
were
to
set
trudging
all
over
paris
for
francs
of
discount
when
no
man
is
my
master
and
i
only
pay
seven
francs
in
the
shape
of
taxes
the
first
bill
for
a
thousand
francs
was
presented
by
a
young
fellow
a
smart
buck
with
a
spangled
waistcoat
and
an
eyeglass
and
a
tilbury
and
an
english
horse
and
all
the
rest
of
it
the
bill
bore
the
signature
of
one
of
the
prettiest
women
in
paris
married
to
a
count
a
great
landowner
now
how
came
that
countess
to
put
her
name
to
a
bill
of
exchange
legally
not
worth
the
paper
it
was
written
upon
but
practically
very
good
business
for
these
women
poor
things
are
afraid
of
the
scandal
that
a
protested
bill
makes
in
a
family
and
would
give
themselves
away
in
payment
sooner
than
fail
i
wanted
to
find
out
what
that
bill
of
exchange
really
represented
was
it
stupidity
imprudence
love
or
charity
the
second
bill
bearing
the
signature
fanny
malvaut
came
to
me
from
a
on
the
highway
to
bankruptcy
now
no
creature
who
has
any
credit
with
a
bank
comes
to
the
first
step
to
my
door
means
that
a
man
is
desperately
hard
up
that
the
news
of
his
failure
will
soon
come
out
and
most
of
all
it
means
that
he
has
been
everywhere
else
first
the
stag
is
always
at
bay
when
i
see
him
and
a
pack
of
creditors
are
hard
upon
his
track
the
countess
lived
in
the
rue
du
helder
and
my
fanny
in
the
rue
montmartre
how
many
conjectures
i
made
as
i
set
out
this
morning
if
these
two
women
were
not
able
to
pay
they
would
show
me
more
respect
than
they
would
show
their
own
fathers
what
tricks
and
grimaces
would
not
the
countess
try
for
a
thousand
francs
she
would
be
so
nice
to
me
she
would
talk
to
me
in
that
ingratiating
tone
peculiar
to
endorsers
of
bills
she
would
pour
out
a
torrent
of
coaxing
words
perhaps
she
would
beg
and
pray
and
i
here
the
old
man
turned
his
pale
eyes
upon
me
and
i
not
to
be
moved
inexorable
he
continued
i
am
there
as
the
avenger
the
apparition
of
remorse
so
much
for
hypotheses
i
reached
the
house
madame
la
comtesse
is
asleep
says
the
maid
when
can
i
see
her
at
twelve
o
is
madame
la
comtesse
ill
no
sir
but
she
only
came
home
at
three
o
clock
this
morning
from
a
my
name
is
gobseck
tell
her
that
i
shall
call
again
at
twelve
o
clock
and
i
went
out
leaving
traces
of
my
muddy
boots
on
the
carpet
which
covered
the
paved
staircase
i
like
to
leave
mud
on
a
rich
man
s
carpet
it
is
not
petty
spite
i
like
to
make
them
feel
a
touch
of
the
claws
of
necessity
in
the
rue
montmartre
i
thrust
open
the
old
gateway
of
a
house
and
looked
into
a
dark
courtyard
where
the
sunlight
never
shines
the
porter
s
lodge
was
grimy
the
window
looked
like
the
sleeve
of
some
shabby
wadded
gown
greasy
dirty
and
full
of
holes
mlle
fanny
malvaut
she
has
gone
out
but
if
you
have
come
about
a
bill
the
money
is
waiting
for
i
will
look
in
again
said
i
as
soon
as
i
knew
that
the
porter
had
the
money
for
me
i
wanted
to
know
what
the
girl
was
like
i
pictured
her
as
pretty
the
rest
of
the
morning
i
spent
in
looking
at
the
prints
in
the
shop
windows
along
the
boulevard
then
just
as
it
struck
twelve
i
went
through
the
countess
madame
has
just
this
minute
rung
for
me
said
the
maid
i
don
t
think
she
can
see
you
i
will
wait
said
i
and
sat
down
in
an
venetian
shutters
were
opened
and
presently
the
maid
came
hurrying
back
come
in
from
the
sweet
tone
of
the
girl
s
voice
i
knew
that
the
mistress
could
not
be
ready
to
pay
what
a
handsome
woman
it
was
that
i
saw
in
another
moment
she
had
flung
an
indian
shawl
hastily
over
her
bare
shoulders
covering
herself
with
it
completely
while
it
revealed
the
bare
outlines
of
the
form
beneath
she
wore
a
loose
gown
trimmed
with
snowy
ruffles
which
told
plainly
that
her
laundress
bills
amounted
to
something
like
two
thousand
francs
in
the
course
of
a
year
her
dark
curls
escaped
from
beneath
a
bright
indian
handkerchief
knotted
carelessly
about
her
head
after
the
fashion
of
creole
women
the
bed
lay
in
disorder
that
told
of
broken
slumber
a
painter
would
have
paid
money
to
stay
a
while
to
see
the
scene
that
i
saw
under
the
luxurious
hanging
draperies
the
pillow
crushed
into
the
depths
of
an
quilt
its
lace
border
standing
out
in
contrast
against
the
background
of
blue
silk
bore
a
vague
impress
that
kindled
the
imagination
a
pair
of
satin
slippers
gleamed
from
the
great
rug
spread
by
the
carved
mahogany
lions
at
the
where
she
had
flung
them
off
in
her
weariness
after
the
ball
a
crumpled
gown
hung
over
a
chair
the
sleeves
touching
the
floor
stockings
which
a
breath
would
have
blown
away
were
twisted
about
the
leg
of
an
while
ribbon
garters
straggled
over
a
settee
a
fan
of
price
half
unfolded
glittered
on
the
drawers
stood
open
flowers
diamonds
gloves
a
bouquet
a
girdle
were
littered
about
the
room
was
full
of
vague
sweet
perfume
and
beneath
all
the
luxury
and
disorder
beauty
and
incongruity
i
saw
misery
crouching
in
wait
for
her
or
for
her
adorer
misery
rearing
its
head
for
the
countess
had
begun
to
feel
the
edge
of
those
fangs
her
tired
face
was
an
epitome
of
the
room
strewn
with
relics
of
past
festival
the
scattered
gewgaws
pitiable
this
morning
when
gathered
together
and
coherent
had
turned
heads
the
night
before
what
efforts
to
drink
of
the
tantalus
cup
of
bliss
i
could
read
in
these
traces
of
love
stricken
by
the
thunderbolt
remorse
in
this
visible
presentment
of
a
life
of
luxury
extravagance
and
riot
there
were
faint
red
marks
on
her
young
face
signs
of
the
fineness
of
the
skin
but
her
features
were
coarsened
as
it
were
and
the
circles
about
her
eyes
were
unwontedly
dark
nature
nevertheless
was
so
vigorous
in
her
that
these
traces
of
past
folly
did
not
spoil
her
beauty
her
eyes
glittered
she
looked
like
some
of
da
vinci
s
i
have
dealt
in
pictures
so
magnificently
full
of
life
and
energy
was
she
there
was
nothing
starved
nor
stinted
in
feature
or
outline
she
awakened
desire
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
some
passion
in
her
yet
stronger
than
love
i
was
taken
with
her
it
was
a
long
while
since
my
heart
had
throbbed
so
i
was
paid
then
and
there
for
i
would
give
a
thousand
francs
for
a
sensation
that
should
bring
me
back
memories
of
youth
monsieur
she
said
finding
a
chair
for
me
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
wait
until
this
time
madame
i
said
folding
up
the
bill
again
i
can
not
legally
protest
this
bill
any
and
within
myself
i
said
pay
the
price
of
your
luxury
pay
for
your
name
pay
for
your
ease
pay
for
the
monopoly
which
you
enjoy
the
rich
have
invented
judges
and
courts
of
law
to
secure
their
goods
and
the
guillotine
that
candle
in
which
so
many
lie
in
silk
under
silken
coverlets
there
is
remorse
and
grinding
of
teeth
beneath
a
smile
and
those
fantastical
lions
jaws
are
gaping
to
set
their
fangs
in
your
protest
the
bill
can
you
mean
it
she
cried
with
her
eyes
upon
me
could
you
have
so
little
consideration
for
me
if
the
king
himself
owed
money
to
me
madame
and
did
not
pay
it
i
should
summons
him
even
sooner
than
any
other
while
we
were
speaking
somebody
tapped
gently
at
the
door
i
can
not
see
any
one
she
cried
imperiously
but
anastasie
i
particularly
wish
to
speak
to
not
just
now
dear
she
answered
in
a
milder
tone
but
with
no
sign
of
relenting
what
nonsense
you
are
talking
to
some
one
said
the
voice
and
in
came
a
man
who
could
only
be
the
count
the
countess
gave
me
a
glance
i
saw
how
it
was
she
was
thoroughly
in
my
power
there
was
a
time
when
i
was
young
and
might
perhaps
have
been
stupid
enough
not
to
protest
the
bill
at
pondicherry
in
i
let
a
woman
off
and
nicely
she
paid
me
out
afterwards
i
deserved
it
what
call
was
there
for
me
to
trust
her
what
does
this
gentleman
want
asked
the
count
i
could
see
that
the
countess
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
the
white
satin
skin
of
her
throat
was
rough
turned
to
goose
flesh
to
use
the
familiar
expression
as
for
me
i
laughed
in
myself
without
moving
a
muscle
this
gentleman
is
one
of
my
tradesmen
she
said
the
count
turned
his
back
on
me
i
drew
the
bill
half
out
of
my
pocket
after
that
inexorable
movement
she
came
over
to
me
and
put
a
diamond
into
my
hands
take
it
she
said
and
be
we
exchanged
values
and
i
made
my
bow
and
went
the
diamond
was
quite
worth
twelve
hundred
francs
to
me
out
in
the
courtyard
i
saw
a
swarm
of
flunkeys
brushing
out
their
liveries
waxing
their
boots
and
cleaning
sumptuous
equipages
this
is
what
brings
these
people
to
me
said
i
to
myself
it
is
to
keep
up
this
kind
of
thing
that
they
steal
millions
with
all
due
formalities
and
betray
their
country
the
great
lord
and
the
little
man
who
apes
the
great
lord
bathes
in
mud
once
for
all
to
save
himself
a
splash
or
two
when
he
goes
afoot
through
the
just
then
the
great
gates
were
opened
to
admit
a
cabriolet
it
was
the
same
young
fellow
who
had
brought
the
bill
to
me
sir
i
said
as
he
alighted
here
are
two
hundred
francs
which
i
beg
you
to
return
to
mme
la
comtesse
and
have
the
goodness
to
tell
her
that
i
hold
the
pledge
which
she
deposited
with
me
this
morning
at
her
disposition
for
a
he
took
the
two
hundred
francs
and
an
ironical
smile
stole
over
his
face
it
was
as
if
he
had
said
aha
so
she
has
paid
it
has
she
faith
so
much
the
better
i
read
the
countess
future
in
his
face
that
young
gentleman
is
a
heartless
gambler
he
will
ruin
himself
ruin
her
ruin
her
husband
ruin
the
children
eat
up
their
portions
and
work
more
havoc
in
parisian
salons
than
a
whole
battery
of
howitzers
in
a
regiment
i
went
back
to
see
mlle
fanny
in
the
rue
montmartre
climbed
a
very
steep
narrow
staircase
and
reached
a
dwelling
on
the
fifth
floor
everything
was
as
neat
as
a
new
ducat
i
did
not
see
a
speck
of
dust
on
the
furniture
in
the
first
room
where
mlle
fanny
was
sitting
mlle
fanny
herself
was
a
young
parisian
girl
quietly
dressed
with
a
delicate
fresh
face
and
a
winning
look
the
arrangement
of
her
neatly
brushed
chestnut
hair
in
a
double
curve
on
her
forehead
lent
a
refined
expression
to
blue
eyes
clear
as
crystal
the
broad
daylight
streaming
in
through
the
short
curtains
against
the
window
pane
fell
with
softened
light
on
her
girlish
face
a
pile
of
shaped
pieces
of
linen
told
me
that
she
was
a
sempstress
she
looked
like
a
spirit
of
solitude
when
i
held
out
the
bill
i
remarked
that
she
had
not
been
at
home
when
i
called
in
the
morning
but
the
money
was
left
with
the
porter
s
wife
said
she
i
pretended
not
to
understand
you
go
out
early
mademoiselle
it
i
very
seldom
leave
my
room
but
when
you
work
all
night
you
are
obliged
to
take
a
bath
i
looked
at
her
a
glance
told
me
all
about
her
life
here
was
a
girl
condemned
by
misfortune
to
toil
a
girl
who
came
of
honest
farmer
folk
for
she
had
still
a
freckle
or
two
that
told
of
country
birth
there
was
an
indefinable
atmosphere
of
goodness
about
her
i
felt
as
if
i
were
breathing
sincerity
and
frank
innocence
it
was
refreshing
to
my
lungs
poor
innocent
child
she
had
faith
in
something
there
was
a
crucifix
and
a
sprig
or
two
of
green
box
above
her
poor
little
painted
wooden
bedstead
i
felt
touched
or
somewhat
inclined
that
way
i
felt
ready
to
offer
to
charge
no
more
than
twelve
per
cent
and
so
give
something
towards
establishing
her
in
a
good
way
of
business
but
maybe
she
has
a
little
youngster
of
a
cousin
i
said
to
myself
who
would
raise
money
on
her
signature
and
sponge
on
the
poor
so
i
went
away
keeping
my
generous
impulses
well
under
control
for
i
have
frequently
had
occasion
to
observe
that
when
benevolence
does
no
harm
to
him
who
gives
it
it
is
the
ruin
of
him
who
takes
when
you
came
in
i
was
thinking
that
fanny
malvaut
would
make
a
nice
little
wife
i
was
thinking
of
the
contrast
between
her
pure
lonely
life
and
the
life
of
the
countess
she
has
sunk
as
low
as
a
bill
of
exchange
already
she
will
sink
to
the
lowest
depths
of
degradation
before
she
has
done
i
scrutinized
him
during
the
deep
silence
that
followed
but
in
a
moment
he
spoke
again
well
he
said
do
you
think
that
it
is
nothing
to
have
this
power
of
insight
into
the
deepest
recesses
of
the
human
heart
to
embrace
so
many
lives
to
see
the
naked
truth
underlying
it
all
there
are
no
two
dramas
alike
there
are
hideous
sores
deadly
chagrins
love
scenes
misery
that
soon
will
lie
under
the
ripples
of
the
seine
young
men
s
joys
that
lead
to
the
scaffold
the
laughter
of
despair
and
sumptuous
banquets
yesterday
it
was
a
tragedy
a
worthy
soul
of
a
father
drowned
himself
because
he
could
not
support
his
family
is
a
comedy
some
youngster
will
try
to
rehearse
the
scene
of
dimanche
brought
up
to
date
you
have
heard
the
people
extol
the
eloquence
of
our
latter
day
preachers
now
and
again
i
have
wasted
my
time
by
going
to
hear
them
they
produced
a
change
in
my
opinions
but
in
my
conduct
as
somebody
said
i
can
t
recollect
his
name
in
my
conduct
never
well
well
these
good
priests
and
your
mirabeaus
and
vergniauds
and
the
rest
of
them
are
mere
stammering
beginners
compared
with
these
orators
of
mine
often
it
is
some
girl
in
love
some
merchant
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
some
mother
with
a
son
s
to
conceal
some
starving
artist
some
great
man
whose
influence
is
on
the
wane
and
for
lack
of
money
is
like
to
lose
the
fruit
of
all
his
labors
the
power
of
their
pleading
has
made
me
shudder
sublime
actors
such
as
these
play
for
me
for
an
audience
of
one
and
they
can
not
deceive
me
i
can
look
into
their
inmost
thoughts
and
read
them
as
god
reads
them
nothing
is
hidden
from
me
nothing
is
refused
to
the
holder
of
the
to
loose
and
to
bind
i
am
rich
enough
to
buy
the
consciences
of
those
who
control
the
action
of
ministers
from
their
office
boys
to
their
mistresses
is
not
that
power
i
can
possess
the
fairest
women
receive
their
softest
caresses
is
not
that
pleasure
and
is
not
your
whole
social
economy
summed
up
in
terms
of
power
and
pleasure
there
are
ten
of
us
in
paris
silent
unknown
kings
the
arbiters
of
your
destinies
what
is
life
but
a
machine
set
in
motion
by
money
know
this
for
certain
methods
are
always
confounded
with
results
you
will
never
succeed
in
separating
the
soul
from
the
senses
spirit
from
matter
gold
is
the
spiritual
basis
of
existing
the
ten
of
us
are
bound
by
the
ties
of
common
interest
we
meet
on
certain
days
of
the
week
at
the
cafe
themis
near
the
pont
neuf
and
there
in
conclave
we
reveal
the
mysteries
of
finance
no
fortune
can
deceive
us
we
are
in
possession
of
family
secrets
in
all
directions
we
keep
a
kind
of
black
book
in
which
we
note
the
most
important
bills
issued
drafts
on
public
credit
or
on
banks
or
given
and
taken
in
the
course
of
business
we
are
the
casuists
of
the
paris
bourse
a
kind
of
inquisition
weighing
and
analyzing
the
most
insignificant
actions
of
every
man
of
any
fortune
and
our
forecasts
are
infallible
one
of
us
looks
out
over
the
judicial
world
one
over
the
financial
another
surveys
the
administrative
and
yet
another
the
business
world
i
myself
keep
an
eye
on
eldest
sons
artists
people
in
the
great
world
and
gamblers
on
the
most
sensational
side
of
paris
every
one
who
comes
to
us
lets
us
into
his
neighbor
s
secrets
thwarted
passion
and
mortified
vanity
are
great
babblers
vice
and
disappointment
and
vindictiveness
are
the
best
of
all
detectives
my
colleagues
like
myself
have
enjoyed
all
things
are
sated
with
all
things
and
have
reached
the
point
when
power
and
money
are
loved
for
their
own
sake
here
he
said
indicating
his
bare
chilly
room
here
the
most
gallant
who
chafes
at
a
word
and
draws
swords
for
a
syllable
elsewhere
will
entreat
with
clasped
hands
there
is
no
city
merchant
so
proud
no
woman
so
vain
of
her
beauty
no
soldier
of
so
bold
a
spirit
but
that
they
entreat
me
here
one
and
all
with
tears
of
rage
or
anguish
in
their
eyes
here
they
kneel
the
famous
artist
and
the
man
of
letters
whose
name
will
go
down
to
posterity
here
in
short
he
lifted
his
hand
to
his
forehead
all
the
inheritances
and
all
the
concerns
of
all
paris
are
weighed
in
the
balance
are
you
still
of
the
opinion
that
there
are
no
delights
behind
the
blank
mask
which
so
often
has
amazed
you
by
its
impassiveness
he
asked
stretching
out
that
livid
face
which
reeked
of
money
i
went
back
to
my
room
feeling
stupefied
the
little
wizened
old
man
had
grown
great
he
had
been
metamorphosed
under
my
eyes
into
a
strange
visionary
symbol
he
had
come
to
be
the
power
of
gold
personified
i
shrank
shuddering
from
life
and
my
kind
is
it
really
so
i
thought
must
everything
be
resolved
into
gold
i
remember
that
it
was
long
before
i
slept
that
night
i
saw
heaps
of
gold
all
about
me
my
thoughts
were
full
of
the
lovely
countess
i
confess
to
my
shame
that
the
vision
completely
eclipsed
another
quiet
innocent
figure
the
figure
of
the
woman
who
had
entered
upon
a
life
of
toil
and
obscurity
but
on
the
morrow
through
the
clouds
of
slumber
fanny
s
sweet
face
rose
before
me
in
all
its
beauty
and
i
thought
of
nothing
will
you
take
a
glass
of
asked
the
vicomtesse
interrupting
derville
i
should
be
glad
of
but
i
can
see
nothing
in
this
that
can
touch
our
concerns
said
mme
de
grandlieu
as
she
rang
the
bell
sardanapalus
cried
derville
flinging
out
his
favorite
invocation
mademoiselle
camille
will
be
wide
awake
in
a
moment
if
i
say
that
her
happiness
depended
not
so
long
ago
upon
daddy
gobseck
but
as
the
old
gentleman
died
at
the
age
of
ninety
de
restaud
will
soon
be
in
possession
of
a
handsome
fortune
this
requires
some
explanation
as
for
poor
fanny
malvaut
you
know
her
she
is
my
poor
fellow
he
would
admit
that
with
his
usual
frankness
with
a
score
of
people
to
hear
him
said
the
vicomtesse
i
would
proclaim
it
to
the
universe
said
the
attorney
go
on
drink
your
glass
my
poor
derville
you
will
never
be
anything
but
the
happiest
and
the
best
of
i
left
you
in
the
rue
du
helder
remarked
the
uncle
raising
his
face
after
a
gentle
doze
you
had
gone
to
see
a
countess
what
have
you
done
with
her
a
few
days
after
my
conversation
with
the
old
dutchman
derville
continued
i
sent
in
my
thesis
and
became
first
a
licentiate
in
law
and
afterwards
an
advocate
the
old
miser
s
opinion
of
me
went
up
considerably
he
consulted
me
gratuitously
on
all
the
ticklish
bits
of
business
which
he
undertook
when
he
had
made
quite
sure
how
he
stood
business
which
would
have
seemed
unsafe
to
any
ordinary
practitioner
this
man
over
whom
no
one
appeared
to
have
the
slightest
influence
listened
to
my
advice
with
something
like
respect
it
is
true
that
he
always
found
that
it
turned
out
very
well
at
length
i
became
in
the
office
where
i
had
worked
for
three
years
and
then
i
left
the
rue
des
gres
for
rooms
in
my
employer
s
house
i
had
my
board
and
lodging
and
a
hundred
and
fifty
francs
per
month
it
was
a
great
day
for
me
when
i
went
to
bid
the
usurer
he
showed
no
sign
of
feeling
he
was
neither
cordial
nor
sorry
to
lose
me
he
did
not
ask
me
to
come
to
see
him
and
only
gave
me
one
of
those
glances
which
seemed
in
some
sort
to
reveal
a
power
of
by
the
end
of
a
week
my
old
neighbor
came
to
see
me
with
a
tolerably
thorny
bit
of
business
an
expropriation
and
he
continued
to
ask
for
my
advice
with
as
much
freedom
as
if
he
paid
for
it
my
principal
was
a
man
of
pleasure
and
expensive
tastes
before
the
second
year
was
out
he
had
got
himself
into
difficulties
and
was
obliged
to
sell
his
practice
a
professional
connection
in
those
days
did
not
fetch
the
present
exorbitant
prices
and
my
principal
asked
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
now
an
active
man
of
competent
knowledge
and
intelligence
might
hope
to
pay
off
the
capital
in
ten
years
paying
interest
and
living
respectably
in
the
meantime
if
he
could
command
confidence
but
i
as
the
seventh
child
of
a
small
tradesman
at
noyon
i
had
not
a
sou
to
my
name
nor
personal
knowledge
of
any
capitalist
but
daddy
gobseck
an
ambitious
idea
and
an
indefinable
glimmer
of
hope
put
heart
into
me
to
gobseck
i
betook
myself
and
slowly
one
evening
i
made
my
way
to
the
rue
des
gres
my
heart
thumped
heavily
as
i
knocked
at
his
door
in
the
gloomy
house
i
recollected
all
the
things
that
he
used
to
tell
me
at
a
time
when
i
myself
was
very
far
from
suspecting
the
violence
of
the
anguish
awaiting
those
who
crossed
his
threshold
now
it
was
i
who
was
about
to
beg
and
pray
like
so
many
others
well
no
not
i
said
to
myself
an
honest
man
must
keep
his
wherever
he
goes
success
is
not
worth
cringing
for
let
us
show
him
a
front
as
decided
as
his
daddy
gobseck
had
taken
my
room
since
i
left
the
house
so
as
to
have
no
neighbor
he
had
made
a
little
grated
window
too
in
his
door
since
then
and
did
not
open
until
he
had
taken
a
look
at
me
and
saw
who
i
was
well
said
he
in
his
thin
flute
notes
so
your
principal
is
selling
his
practice
how
did
you
know
that
said
i
he
has
not
spoken
of
it
as
yet
except
to
the
old
man
s
lips
were
drawn
in
puckers
like
a
curtain
to
either
corner
of
his
mouth
as
a
soundless
smile
bore
a
hard
glance
company
nothing
else
would
have
brought
you
here
he
said
drily
after
a
pause
which
i
spent
in
confusion
listen
to
me
gobseck
i
began
with
such
serenity
as
i
could
assume
before
the
old
man
who
gazed
at
me
with
steady
eyes
there
was
a
clear
light
burning
in
them
that
disconcerted
me
he
made
a
gesture
as
if
to
bid
me
go
i
know
that
it
is
not
easy
to
work
on
your
feelings
so
i
will
not
waste
my
eloquence
on
the
attempt
to
put
my
position
before
you
i
am
a
penniless
clerk
with
no
one
to
look
to
but
you
and
no
heart
in
the
world
but
yours
can
form
a
clear
idea
of
my
probable
future
let
us
leave
hearts
out
of
the
question
business
is
business
and
business
is
not
carried
on
with
sentimentality
like
romances
now
to
the
facts
my
principal
s
practice
is
worth
in
his
hands
about
twenty
thousand
francs
per
annum
in
my
hands
i
think
it
would
bring
in
forty
thousand
he
is
willing
to
sell
it
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
and
i
said
striking
my
forehead
i
feel
that
if
you
would
lend
me
the
i
could
clear
it
off
in
ten
years
come
that
is
plain
speaking
said
daddy
gobseck
and
he
held
out
his
hand
and
grasped
mine
nobody
since
i
have
been
in
business
has
stated
the
motives
of
his
visit
more
clearly
guarantees
asked
he
scanning
me
from
head
to
foot
none
to
give
he
added
after
a
pause
how
old
are
you
in
ten
days
time
said
i
or
i
could
not
open
the
well
it
is
my
word
we
must
be
quick
about
it
or
i
shall
have
some
one
buying
over
my
bring
your
certificate
of
birth
round
morning
and
we
will
talk
i
will
think
it
next
morning
at
eight
o
clock
i
stood
in
the
old
man
s
room
he
took
the
document
put
on
his
spectacles
coughed
spat
wrapped
himself
up
in
his
black
greatcoat
and
read
the
whole
certificate
through
from
beginning
to
end
then
he
turned
it
over
and
over
looked
at
me
coughed
again
fidgeted
about
in
his
chair
and
said
we
will
try
to
arrange
this
bit
of
i
trembled
i
make
fifty
per
cent
on
my
capital
he
continued
sometimes
i
make
a
hundred
two
hundred
five
hundred
per
i
turned
pale
at
the
words
but
as
we
are
acquaintances
i
shall
be
satisfied
to
take
twelve
and
a
half
per
cent
per
he
hesitated
well
yes
from
you
i
would
be
content
to
take
thirteen
per
cent
per
annum
will
that
suit
you
yes
i
answered
but
if
it
is
too
much
stick
up
for
yourself
grotius
a
name
he
jokingly
gave
me
when
i
ask
you
for
thirteen
per
cent
it
is
all
in
the
way
of
business
look
into
it
see
if
you
can
pay
it
i
don
t
like
a
man
to
agree
too
easily
is
it
too
much
no
said
i
i
will
make
up
for
it
by
working
a
little
gad
your
clients
will
pay
for
it
said
he
looking
at
me
wickedly
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eyes
no
by
all
the
devils
in
hell
cried
i
it
shall
be
i
who
will
pay
i
would
sooner
cut
my
hand
off
than
flay
said
daddy
gobseck
why
fees
are
all
according
to
scale
i
added
not
for
compromises
and
settlements
out
of
court
and
cases
where
litigants
come
to
terms
said
he
you
can
send
in
a
bill
for
thousands
of
francs
six
thousand
even
at
a
swoop
it
depends
on
the
importance
of
the
case
for
conferences
with
and
expenses
and
drafts
and
memorials
and
your
jargon
a
man
must
learn
to
look
out
for
business
of
this
kind
i
will
recommend
you
as
a
most
competent
clever
attorney
i
will
send
you
such
a
lot
of
work
of
this
sort
that
your
colleagues
will
be
fit
to
burst
with
envy
werbrust
palma
and
gigonnet
my
cronies
shall
hand
over
their
expropriations
to
you
they
have
plenty
of
them
the
lord
knows
so
you
will
have
two
practices
the
one
you
are
buying
and
the
other
i
will
build
up
for
you
you
ought
almost
to
pay
me
fifteen
per
cent
on
my
so
be
it
but
no
more
said
i
with
the
firmness
which
means
that
a
man
is
determined
not
to
concede
another
point
daddy
gobseck
s
face
relaxed
he
looked
pleased
with
me
i
shall
pay
the
money
over
to
your
principal
myself
said
he
so
as
to
establish
a
lien
on
the
purchase
and
oh
anything
you
like
in
the
way
of
and
besides
that
you
will
give
me
bills
for
the
amount
made
payable
to
a
third
party
name
left
blank
fifteen
bills
of
ten
thousand
francs
well
so
long
as
it
is
acknowledged
in
writing
that
this
is
a
double
no
gobseck
broke
in
upon
me
no
why
should
i
trust
you
any
more
than
you
trust
me
i
kept
silence
and
furthermore
he
continued
with
a
sort
of
good
humor
you
will
give
me
your
advice
without
charging
fees
as
long
as
i
live
will
you
not
so
be
it
so
long
as
there
is
no
precisely
said
he
ah
by
the
by
you
will
allow
me
to
go
to
see
you
plainly
the
old
man
found
it
not
so
easy
to
assume
the
air
of
i
shall
always
be
ah
yes
but
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
arrange
of
a
morning
you
will
have
your
affairs
to
attend
to
and
i
have
then
come
in
the
oh
no
he
answered
briskly
you
ought
to
go
into
society
and
see
your
clients
and
i
myself
have
my
friends
at
my
his
friends
thought
i
to
very
well
said
i
why
not
come
at
that
is
the
time
said
gobseck
after
change
at
five
o
clock
good
you
will
see
me
wednesdays
and
saturdays
we
will
talk
over
business
like
a
pair
of
friends
aha
i
am
gay
sometimes
just
give
me
the
wing
of
a
partridge
and
a
glass
of
champagne
and
we
will
have
our
chat
together
i
know
a
great
many
things
that
can
be
told
now
at
this
distance
of
time
i
will
teach
you
to
know
men
and
what
is
more
women
oh
a
partridge
and
a
glass
of
champagne
if
you
don
t
do
anything
foolish
or
i
shall
lose
my
faith
in
you
and
don
t
set
up
housekeeping
in
a
grand
way
just
one
old
general
servant
i
will
come
and
see
that
you
keep
your
health
i
have
capital
invested
in
your
head
he
he
so
i
am
bound
to
look
after
you
there
come
round
in
the
evening
and
bring
your
principal
with
you
would
you
mind
telling
me
if
there
is
no
harm
in
asking
what
was
the
good
of
my
birth
certificate
in
this
business
i
asked
when
the
little
old
man
and
i
stood
on
the
doorstep
van
gobseck
shrugged
his
shoulders
smiled
maliciously
and
said
what
blockheads
youngsters
are
learn
master
attorney
for
learn
you
must
if
you
don
t
mean
to
be
taken
in
that
integrity
and
brains
in
a
man
under
thirty
are
commodities
which
can
be
mortgaged
after
that
age
there
is
no
counting
on
a
and
with
that
he
shut
the
door
three
months
later
i
was
an
attorney
before
very
long
madame
it
was
my
good
fortune
to
undertake
the
suit
for
the
recovery
of
your
estates
i
won
the
day
and
my
name
became
known
in
spite
of
the
exorbitant
rate
of
interest
i
paid
off
gobseck
in
less
than
five
years
i
married
fanny
malvaut
whom
i
loved
with
all
my
heart
there
was
a
parallel
between
her
life
and
mine
between
our
hard
work
and
our
luck
which
increased
the
strength
of
feeling
on
either
side
one
of
her
uncles
a
farmer
died
and
left
her
seventy
thousand
francs
which
helped
to
clear
off
the
loan
from
that
day
my
life
has
been
nothing
but
happiness
and
prosperity
nothing
is
more
utterly
uninteresting
than
a
happy
man
so
let
us
say
no
more
on
that
head
and
return
to
the
rest
of
the
characters
about
a
year
after
the
purchase
of
the
practice
i
was
dragged
into
a
bachelor
given
by
one
of
our
number
who
had
lost
a
bet
to
a
young
man
greatly
in
vogue
in
the
fashionable

the
dandyism

it
is

he
can
gamble

and

more
gracefully
than
any

he
is
a
judge
of
horses
hats
and
pictures
all
the
women
lose
their
heads
over
him
he
always
spends
something
like
a

a
year
and
no

can
discover
that

is
a
brilliant
link
between
the
hulks
and
the
best
society

belongs
to
the
eminently
intelligent
class
from
which
a
mirabeau

had
heard
the
vicomtesse

to

i
had
heard
a
good
deal
about
this
individual
from
poor
old
goriot
a
client
of
mine
and
i
had
already
been
at
some
pains
to
avoid
the
dangerous
honor
of
his
acquaintance
for
i
came
across
him
sometimes
in
society
still
my
chum
was
so
pressing
about
this
of
his
that
i
could
not
well
get
out
of
it
unless
i
wished
to
earn
a
name
for
squeamishness
madame
you
could
hardly
imagine
what
a
bachelor

is
like
it
means
superb
display
and
a
studied
refinement
seldom
seen
the
luxury
of
a
miser
when
vanity
leads
him
to
be
sumptuous
for
a
day
you
are
surprised
as
you
enter
the
room
at
the
neatness
of
the
table
dazzling
by
reason
of
its
silver
and
crystal
and
linen
damask
life
is
here
in
full
bloom
the
young
fellows
are
graceful
to
behold
they
smile
and
talk
in
low
demure
voices
like
so
many
brides
everything
about
them
looks
girlish
two
hours

broken

crumpled
and
torn
to

strewn
about
among

there
is

uproar
that
stuns
you
jesting

a
fire
of
witticisms
and
bad
jokes
faces
are
empurpled
eyes
inflamed
and
expressionless
unintentional
confidences
tell
you
the
whole

no

any
notion

turn
monomaniac
repeating

the
steadiest
will
propose
an
orgy
if
any
one
in
possession

his

should
come
in
he
would
think
that
he
had
interrupted
a
bacchanalian
rite
it
was
in
the
thick
of
such
a
chaos
that
de
trailles
tried
to
insinuate
himself
into
my
good
graces
my
head
was
fairly
clear
i
was
upon
my
guard
as
for
him
though
he
pretended
to
be
decently
drunk
he
was
perfectly
cool
and
knew
very
well
what
he
was
about
how
it
was
done
i
do
not
know
but
the
upshot
of
it
was
that
when
we
left
grignon
s
rooms
about
nine
o
clock
in
the
evening
de
trailles
had
thoroughly
bewitched
me
i
had
given
him
my
promise
that
i
would
introduce
him
the
next
day
to
our
papa
gobseck
the
words
honor
virtue
countess
honest
woman
and
were
mingled
in
his
discourse
with
magical
potency
thanks
to
that
golden
tongue
of
his
when
i
awoke
next
morning
and
tried
to
recollect
what
i
had
done
the
day
before
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
i
could
make
a
connected
tale
from
my
impressions
at
last
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
daughter
of
one
of
my
clients
was
in
danger
of
losing
her
reputation
together
with
her
husband
s
love
and
esteem
if
she
could
not
get
fifty
thousand
francs
together
in
the
course
of
the
morning
there
had
been
gaming
debts
and
accounts
money
lost
to
heaven
knows
whom
my
magician
of
a
boon
companion
had
impressed
it
upon
me
that
she
was
rich
enough
to
make
good
these
reverses
by
a
few
years
of
economy
but
only
now
did
i
begin
to
guess
the
reasons
of
his
urgency
i
confess
to
my
shame
that
i
had
not
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
but
that
it
was
a
matter
of
importance
that
daddy
gobseck
should
make
it
up
with
this
dandy
i
was
dressing
when
the
young
gentleman
appeared
m
le
comte
said
i
after
the
usual
greetings
i
fail
to
see
why
you
should
need
me
to
effect
an
introduction
to
van
gobseck
the
most
civil
and
of
capitalists
money
will
be
forthcoming
if
he
has
any
or
rather
if
you
can
give
him
adequate
monsieur
said
he
it
does
not
enter
into
my
thoughts
to
force
you
to
do
me
a
service
even
though
you
have
passed
your
sardanapalus
said
i
to
myself
am
i
going
to
let
that
fellow
imagine
that
i
will
not
keep
my
word
with
him
i
had
the
honor
of
telling
you
yesterday
said
he
that
i
had
fallen
out
with
daddy
gobseck
most
inopportunely
and
as
there
is
scarcely
another
man
in
paris
who
can
come
down
on
the
nail
with
a
hundred
thousand
francs
at
the
end
of
the
month
i
begged
of
you
to
make
my
peace
with
him
but
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
m
de
trailles
looked
at
me
with
civil
insult
in
his
expression
and
made
as
if
he
would
take
his
leave
i
am
ready
to
go
with
you
said
i
when
we
reached
the
rue
de
gres
my
dandy
looked
about
him
with
a
circumspection
and
uneasiness
that
set
me
wondering
his
face
grew
livid
flushed
and
yellow
turn
and
turn
about
and
by
the
time
that
gobseck
s
door
came
in
sight
the
perspiration
stood
in
drops
on
his
forehead
we
were
just
getting
out
of
the
cabriolet
when
a
hackney
cab
turned
into
the
street
my
companion
s
hawk
eye
detected
a
woman
in
the
depths
of
the
vehicle
his
face
lighted
up
with
a
gleam
of
almost
savage
joy
he
called
to
a
little
boy
who
was
passing
and
gave
him
his
horse
to
hold
then
we
went
up
to
the
old
bill
discounter
m
gobseck
said
i
i
have
brought
one
of
my
most
intimate
friends
to
see
you
whom
i
trust
as
i
would
trust
the
devil
i
added
for
the
old
man
s
private
ear
to
oblige
me
you
will
do
your
best
for
him
at
the
ordinary
rate
and
pull
him
out
of
his
difficulty
if
it
suits
your
convenience
m
de
trailles
made
his
bow
to
gobseck
took
a
seat
and
listened
to
us
with
a
attitude
its
charming
humility
would
have
touched
your
heart
to
see
but
my
gobseck
sits
in
his
chair
by
the
fireside
without
moving
a
muscle
or
changing
a
feature
he
looked
very
like
the
statue
of
voltaire
under
the
peristyle
of
the
as
you
see
it
of
an
evening
he
had
partly
risen
as
if
to
bow
and
the
skull
cap
that
covered
the
top
of
his
head
and
the
narrow
strip
of
sallow
forehead
exhibited
completed
his
likeness
to
the
man
of
marble
i
have
no
money
to
spare
except
for
my
own
clients
said
he
so
you
are
cross
because
i
may
have
tried
in
other
quarters
to
ruin
myself
laughed
the
count
ruin
yourself
repeated
gobseck
ironically
were
you
about
to
remark
that
it
is
impossible
to
ruin
a
man
who
has
nothing
inquired
the
dandy
why
i
defy
you
to
find
a
better
in
paris
he
cried
swinging
round
on
his
heels
this
buffoonery
produced
not
the
slightest
effect
upon
gobseck
am
i
not
on
intimate
terms
with
the
ronquerolles
the
marsays
the
franchessinis
the
two
vandenesses
the
all
the
most
fashionable
young
men
in
paris
in
short
a
prince
and
an
ambassador
you
know
them
both
are
my
partners
at
play
i
draw
my
revenues
from
london
and
carlsbad
and
baden
and
bath
is
not
this
the
most
brilliant
of
all
industries
you
make
a
sponge
of
me
begad
you
do
you
encourage
me
to
go
and
swell
myself
out
in
society
so
that
you
can
squeeze
me
when
i
am
hard
up
but
you
yourselves
are
sponges
just
as
i
am
and
death
will
give
you
a
squeeze
some
that
is
if
there
were
no
spendthrifts
what
would
become
of
you
the
pair
of
us
are
like
soul
and
precisely
come
now
give
us
your
hand
grandaddy
gobseck
and
be
magnanimous
if
this
is
true
and
possible
and
precisely
you
come
to
me
the
usurer
answered
coldly
because
girard
palma
werbrust
and
gigonnet
are
full
up
of
your
paper
they
are
offering
it
at
a
loss
of
fifty
per
cent
and
as
it
is
likely
they
only
gave
you
half
the
figure
on
the
face
of
the
bills
they
are
not
worth
per
cent
of
their
supposed
value
i
am
your
most
obedient
can
i
in
common
decency
lend
a
stiver
to
a
man
who
owes
thirty
thousand
francs
and
has
not
one
farthing
gobseck
continued
the
day
before
yesterday
you
lost
ten
thousand
francs
at
a
ball
at
the
baron
de
nucingen
sir
said
the
count
with
rare
impudence
my
affairs
are
no
concern
of
yours
and
he
looked
the
old
man
up
and
down
a
man
has
no
debts
till
payment
is
my
bills
will
be
duly
that
is
and
at
this
moment
the
question
between
you
and
me
is
simply
whether
the
security
i
am
going
to
offer
is
sufficient
for
the
sum
i
have
come
to
a
cab
stopped
at
the
door
and
the
sound
of
wheels
filled
the
room
i
will
bring
something
directly
which
perhaps
will
satisfy
you
cried
the
young
man
and
he
left
the
room
oh
my
son
exclaimed
gobseck
rising
to
his
feet
and
stretching
out
his
arms
to
me
if
he
has
good
security
you
have
saved
my
life
it
would
be
the
death
of
me
werbrust
and
gigonnet
imagined
that
they
were
going
to
play
off
a
trick
on
me
and
now
thanks
to
you
i
shall
have
a
good
laugh
at
their
expense
there
was
something
frightful
about
the
old
man
s
ecstasy
it
was
the
one
occasion
when
he
opened
his
heart
to
me
and
that
flash
of
joy
swift
though
it
was
will
never
be
effaced
from
my
memory
favor
me
so
far
as
to
stay
here
he
added
i
am
armed
and
a
sure
shot
i
have
gone
and
fought
on
the
deck
when
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
win
or
die
but
i
don
t
care
to
trust
yonder
elegant
he
sat
down
again
in
his
armchair
before
his
bureau
and
his
face
grew
pale
and
impassive
as
before
ah
he
continued
turning
to
me
you
will
see
that
lovely
creature
i
once
told
you
about
i
can
hear
a
fine
lady
s
step
in
the
corridor
it
is
she
no
doubt
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
young
man
came
in
with
a
woman
on
his
arm
i
recognized
the
countess
whose
levee
gobseck
had
described
for
me
one
of
old
goriot
s
two
daughters
the
countess
did
not
see
me
at
first
i
stayed
where
i
was
in
the
window
bay
with
my
face
against
the
pane
but
i
saw
her
give
maxime
a
suspicious
glance
as
she
came
into
the
s
damp
dark
room
so
beautiful
she
was
that
in
spite
of
her
faults
i
felt
sorry
for
her
there
was
a
terrible
storm
of
anguish
in
her
heart
her
haughty
proud
features
were
drawn
and
distorted
with
pain
which
she
strove
in
vain
to
disguise
the
young
man
had
come
to
be
her
evil
genius
i
admired
gobseck
whose
perspicacity
had
foreseen
their
future
four
years
ago
at
the
first
bill
which
she
endorsed
probably
said
i
to
myself
this
monster
with
the
angel
face
controls
every
possible
spring
of
action
in
her
rules
her
through
vanity
jealousy
pleasure
and
the
current
of
life
in
the
the
vicomtesse
de
grandlieu
broke
in
on
the
story
why
the
woman
s
very
virtues
have
been
turned
against
her
she
exclaimed
he
has
made
her
shed
tears
of
devotion
and
then
abused
her
kindness
and
made
her
pay
very
dearly
for
unhallowed
derville
did
not
understand
the
signs
which
mme
de
grandlieu
made
to
him
i
confess
he
said
that
i
had
no
inclination
to
shed
tears
over
the
lot
of
this
unhappy
creature
so
brilliant
in
society
so
repulsive
to
eyes
that
could
read
her
heart
i
shuddered
rather
at
the
sight
of
her
murderer
a
young
angel
with
such
a
clear
brow
such
red
lips
and
white
teeth
such
a
winning
smile
there
they
stood
before
their
judge
he
scrutinizing
them
much
as
some
dominican
inquisitor
might
have
peered
into
the
dungeons
of
the
holy
office
while
the
torture
was
administered
to
two
moors
the
countess
spoke
tremulously
sir
she
said
is
there
any
way
of
obtaining
the
value
of
these
diamonds
and
of
keeping
the
right
of
repurchase
she
held
out
a
yes
madame
i
put
in
and
came
forwards
she
looked
at
me
and
a
shudder
ran
through
her
as
she
recognized
me
and
gave
me
the
glance
which
means
say
nothing
of
this
all
the
world
over
this
said
i
constitutes
a
sale
with
faculty
of
redemption
as
it
is
called
a
formal
agreement
to
transfer
and
deliver
over
a
piece
of
property
either
real
estate
or
personalty
for
a
given
time
on
the
expiry
of
which
the
previous
owner
recovers
his
title
to
the
property
in
question
upon
payment
of
a
stipulated
she
breathed
more
freely
the
count
looked
black
he
had
grave
doubts
whether
gobseck
would
lend
very
much
on
the
diamonds
after
such
a
fall
in
their
value
gobseck
impassive
as
ever
had
taken
up
his
magnifying
glass
and
was
quietly
scrutinizing
the
jewels
if
i
were
to
live
for
a
hundred
years
i
should
never
forget
the
sight
of
his
face
at
that
moment
there
was
a
flush
in
his
pale
cheeks
his
eyes
seemed
to
have
caught
the
sparkle
of
the
stones
for
there
was
an
unnatural
glitter
in
them
he
rose
and
went
to
the
light
holding
the
diamonds
close
to
his
toothless
mouth
as
if
he
meant
to
devour
them
mumbling
vague
words
over
them
holding
up
bracelets
sprays
necklaces
and
tiaras
one
after
another
to
judge
their
water
whiteness
and
cutting
taking
them
out
of
the
and
putting
them
in
again
letting
the
play
of
the
light
bring
out
all
their
fires
he
was
more
like
a
child
than
an
old
man
or
rather
childhood
and
dotage
seemed
to
meet
in
him
fine
stones
the
set
would
have
fetched
three
hundred
thousand
francs
before
the
revolution
what
water
genuine
asiatic
diamonds
from
golconda
or
visapur
do
you
know
what
they
are
worth
no
no
no
one
in
paris
but
gobseck
can
appreciate
them
in
the
time
of
the
empire
such
a
set
would
have
cost
another
two
hundred
thousand
francs
he
gave
a
disgusted
shrug
and
added
but
now
diamonds
are
going
down
in
value
every
day
the
brazilians
have
swamped
the
market
with
them
since
the
peace
but
the
indian
stones
are
a
better
color
others
wear
them
now
besides
court
ladies
does
madame
go
to
court
while
he
flung
out
these
terrible
words
he
examined
one
stone
after
another
with
delight
which
no
words
can
describe
flawless
he
said
here
is
a
speck
here
is
a
flaw
a
fine
stone
that
his
haggard
face
was
so
lighted
up
by
the
sparkling
jewels
that
it
put
me
in
mind
of
a
dingy
old
mirror
such
as
you
see
in
country
inns
the
glass
receives
every
luminous
image
without
reflecting
the
light
and
a
traveler
bold
enough
to
look
for
his
face
in
it
beholds
a
man
in
an
apoplectic
fit
well
asked
the
count
clapping
gobseck
on
the
shoulder
the
old
boy
trembled
he
put
down
his
playthings
on
his
bureau
took
his
seat
and
was
a
once
more
hard
cold
and
polished
as
a
marble
column
how
much
do
you
want
one
hundred
thousand
francs
for
three
years
said
the
count
that
is
possible
said
gobseck
and
then
from
a
mahogany
box
gobseck
s
he
drew
out
a
faultlessly
adjusted
pair
of
scales
he
weighed
the
diamonds
calculating
the
value
of
stones
and
setting
at
sight
heaven
knows
how
delight
and
severity
struggling
in
the
expression
of
his
face
the
meanwhile
the
countess
had
plunged
in
a
kind
of
stupor
to
me
watching
her
it
seemed
that
she
was
fathoming
the
depths
of
the
abyss
into
which
she
had
fallen
there
was
remorse
still
left
in
that
woman
s
soul
perhaps
a
hand
held
out
in
human
charity
might
save
her
i
would
try
are
the
diamonds
your
personal
property
madame
i
asked
in
a
clear
voice
yes
monsieur
she
said
looking
at
me
with
proud
eyes
make
out
the
deed
of
purchase
with
power
of
redemption
chatterbox
said
gobseck
to
me
resigning
his
chair
at
the
bureau
in
my
favor
madame
is
without
doubt
a
married
woman
i
tried
again
she
nodded
abruptly
then
i
will
not
draw
up
the
deed
said
i
and
why
not
asked
gobseck
why
not
echoed
i
as
i
drew
the
old
man
into
the
bay
window
so
as
to
speak
aside
with
him
why
not
this
woman
is
under
her
husband
s
control
the
agreement
would
be
void
in
law
you
could
not
possibly
assert
your
ignorance
of
a
fact
recorded
on
the
very
face
of
the
document
itself
you
would
be
compelled
at
once
to
produce
the
diamonds
deposited
with
you
according
to
the
weight
value
and
cutting
therein
gobseck
cut
me
short
with
a
nod
and
turned
towards
the
guilty
couple
he
is
right
he
said
that
puts
the
whole
thing
in
a
different
light
eighty
thousand
francs
down
and
you
leave
the
diamonds
with
me
he
added
in
the
husky
voice
in
the
way
of
property
possession
is
as
good
as
a
but
objected
the
young
man
you
can
take
it
or
leave
it
continued
gobseck
returning
the
to
the
lady
as
he
spoke
i
have
too
many
risks
to
it
would
be
better
to
throw
yourself
at
your
husband
s
feet
i
bent
to
whisper
in
her
ear
the
usurer
doubtless
knew
what
i
was
saying
from
the
movement
of
my
lips
he
gave
me
a
cool
glance
the
count
s
face
grew
livid
the
countess
was
visibly
wavering
maxime
stepped
up
to
her
and
low
as
he
spoke
i
could
catch
the
words
adieu
dear
anastasie
may
you
be
happy
as
for
me
by
my
troubles
will
be
sir
cried
the
lady
turning
to
gobseck
i
accept
your
come
now
returned
gobseck
you
have
been
a
long
time
in
coming
to
it
my
fair
he
wrote
out
a
cheque
for
fifty
thousand
francs
on
the
bank
of
france
and
handed
it
to
the
countess
now
continued
he
with
a
smile
such
a
smile
as
you
will
see
in
portraits
of
voltaire
now
i
will
give
you
the
rest
of
the
amount
in
bills
thirty
thousand
francs
worth
of
paper
as
good
as
bullion
this
gentleman
here
has
just
said
my
bills
will
be
met
when
they
are
due
added
he
producing
certain
drafts
bearing
the
count
s
signature
all
protested
the
day
before
at
the
request
of
some
of
the
confraternity
who
had
probably
made
them
over
to
him
gobseck
at
a
considerably
reduced
figure
the
young
man
growled
out
something
in
which
the
words
old
scoundrel
were
audible
daddy
gobseck
did
not
move
an
eyebrow
he
drew
a
pair
of
pistols
out
of
a
remarking
coolly
as
the
insulted
man
i
fire
maxime
you
owe
this
gentleman
an
explanation
cried
the
trembling
countess
in
a
low
voice
i
had
no
intention
of
giving
offence
stammered
maxime
i
am
quite
sure
of
that
gobseck
answered
calmly
you
had
no
intention
of
meeting
your
bills
that
was
the
countess
rose
bowed
and
vanished
with
a
great
dread
gnawing
her
i
doubt
not
de
trailles
was
bound
to
follow
but
before
he
went
he
managed
to
say
if
either
of
you
gentlemen
should
forget
himself
i
will
have
his
blood
or
he
will
have
amen
called
daddy
gobseck
as
he
put
his
pistols
back
in
their
place
but
a
man
must
have
blood
in
his
veins
though
before
he
can
risk
it
my
son
and
you
have
nothing
but
mud
in
when
the
door
was
closed
and
the
two
vehicles
had
gone
gobseck
rose
to
his
feet
and
began
to
prance
about
i
have
the
diamonds
i
have
the
diamonds
he
cried
again
and
again
the
beautiful
diamonds
such
diamonds
and
tolerably
cheaply
aha
aha
werbrust
and
gigonnet
you
thought
you
had
old
papa
gobseck
sum
i
am
master
of
the
lot
of
you
paid
paid
principal
and
interest
how
silly
they
will
look
when
i
shall
come
out
with
this
story
between
two
games
of
dominoes
the
dark
glee
the
savage
ferocity
aroused
by
the
possession
of
a
few
pebbles
set
me
shuddering
i
was
dumb
with
amazement
aha
there
you
are
my
boy
said
he
we
will
dine
together
we
will
have
some
fun
at
your
place
for
i
haven
t
a
home
of
my
own
and
these
restaurants
with
their
broths
and
sauces
and
wines
would
poison
the
devil
something
in
my
face
suddenly
brought
back
the
usual
cold
impassive
expression
to
his
you
don
t
understand
it
he
said
and
sitting
down
by
the
hearth
he
put
a
tin
saucepan
full
of
milk
on
the
will
you
breakfast
with
me
continued
he
perhaps
there
will
be
enough
here
for
thanks
said
i
i
do
not
breakfast
till
i
had
scarcely
spoken
before
hurried
footsteps
sounded
from
the
passage
the
stranger
stopped
at
gobseck
s
door
and
rapped
there
was
that
in
the
knock
which
suggested
a
man
transported
with
rage
gobseck
reconnoitred
him
through
the
grating
then
he
opened
the
door
and
in
came
a
man
of
or
so
judged
harmless
apparently
in
spite
of
his
anger
the
newcomer
who
was
quite
plainly
dressed
bore
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
late
duc
de
richelieu
you
must
often
have
met
him
he
was
the
countess
husband
a
man
with
the
aristocratic
figure
permit
the
expression
to
pass
peculiar
to
statesmen
of
your
faubourg
sir
said
this
person
addressing
himself
to
gobseck
who
had
quite
recovered
his
tranquillity
did
my
wife
go
out
of
this
house
just
now
that
is
well
sir
do
you
not
take
my
meaning
i
have
not
the
honor
of
the
acquaintance
of
my
lady
your
wife
returned
gobseck
i
have
had
a
good
many
visitors
this
morning
women
and
men
and
mannish
young
ladies
and
young
gentlemen
who
look
like
young
ladies
i
should
find
it
very
hard
to
say
a
truce
to
jesting
sir
i
mean
the
woman
who
has
this
moment
gone
out
from
how
can
i
know
whether
she
is
your
wife
or
not
i
never
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
you
are
mistaken
gobseck
said
the
count
with
profound
irony
in
his
voice
we
have
met
before
one
morning
in
my
wife
s
bedroom
you
had
come
to
demand
payment
for
a
bill
no
bill
of
it
was
no
business
of
mine
to
inquire
what
value
she
had
received
for
it
said
gobseck
with
a
malignant
look
at
the
count
i
had
come
by
the
bill
in
the
way
of
business
at
the
same
time
monsieur
continued
gobseck
quietly
pouring
coffee
into
his
bowl
of
milk
without
a
trace
of
excitement
or
hurry
in
his
voice
you
will
permit
me
to
observe
that
your
right
to
enter
my
house
and
expostulate
with
me
is
far
from
proven
to
my
mind
i
came
of
age
in
the
year
of
the
preceding
sir
said
the
count
you
have
just
bought
family
diamonds
which
do
not
belong
to
my
wife
for
a
mere
without
feeling
it
incumbent
upon
me
to
tell
you
my
private
affairs
i
will
tell
you
this
much
le
comte
if
mme
la
comtesse
has
taken
your
diamonds
you
should
have
sent
a
circular
around
to
all
the
jewelers
giving
them
notice
not
to
buy
them
she
might
have
sold
them
you
know
my
wife
sir
roared
the
count
she
is
in
her
husband
s
that
is
she
had
no
right
to
dispose
of
those
diamonds
very
well
sir
very
well
sir
i
knew
your
wife
and
she
is
in
her
husband
s
power
i
am
quite
willing
she
is
in
the
power
of
a
good
many
people
but
i
do
know
your
diamonds
if
mme
la
comtesse
can
put
her
name
to
a
bill
she
can
go
into
business
of
course
and
buy
and
sell
diamonds
on
her
own
account
the
thing
is
plain
on
the
face
of
it
sir
cried
the
count
now
white
with
rage
there
are
courts
of
quite
this
gentleman
here
he
added
indicating
me
was
a
witness
of
the
that
is
the
count
turned
to
go
feeling
the
gravity
of
the
affair
i
suddenly
put
in
between
the
two
belligerents
m
le
comte
said
i
you
are
right
and
gobseck
is
by
no
means
in
the
wrong
you
could
not
prosecute
the
purchaser
without
bringing
your
wife
into
court
and
the
whole
of
the
odium
would
not
fall
on
her
i
am
an
attorney
and
i
owe
it
to
myself
and
still
more
to
my
professional
position
to
declare
that
the
diamonds
of
which
you
speak
were
purchased
by
gobseck
in
my
presence
but
in
my
opinion
it
would
be
unwise
to
dispute
the
legality
of
the
sale
especially
as
the
goods
are
not
readily
recognizable
in
equity
our
contention
would
lie
in
law
it
would
collapse
gobseck
is
too
honest
a
man
to
deny
that
the
sale
was
a
profitable
transaction
more
especially
as
my
conscience
no
less
than
my
duty
compels
me
to
make
the
admission
but
once
bring
the
case
into
a
court
of
law
le
comte
the
issue
would
be
doubtful
my
advice
to
you
is
to
come
to
terms
with
gobseck
who
can
plead
that
he
bought
the
diamonds
in
all
good
faith
you
would
be
bound
in
any
case
to
return
the
purchase
money
consent
to
an
arrangement
with
power
to
redeem
at
the
end
of
seven
or
eight
months
or
a
year
even
or
any
convenient
lapse
of
time
for
the
repayment
of
the
sum
borrowed
by
mme
la
comtesse
unless
you
would
prefer
to
repurchase
them
outright
and
give
security
for
gobseck
dipped
his
bread
into
the
bowl
of
coffee
and
ate
with
perfect
indifference
but
at
the
words
come
to
terms
he
looked
at
me
as
who
should
say
a
fine
fellow
that
he
has
learned
something
from
my
lessons
and
i
for
my
part
riposted
with
a
glance
which
he
understood
uncommonly
well
the
business
was
dubious
and
shady
there
was
pressing
need
of
coming
to
terms
gobseck
could
not
deny
all
knowledge
of
it
for
i
should
appear
as
a
witness
the
count
thanked
me
with
a
smile
of
in
the
debate
which
followed
gobseck
showed
greed
enough
and
skill
enough
to
baffle
a
whole
congress
of
diplomatists
but
in
the
end
i
drew
up
an
instrument
in
which
the
count
acknowledged
the
receipt
of
thousand
francs
interest
included
in
consideration
of
which
gobseck
undertook
to
return
the
diamonds
to
the
count
what
waste
exclaimed
he
as
he
put
his
signature
to
the
agreement
how
is
it
possible
to
bridge
such
a
gulf
have
you
many
children
sir
gobseck
asked
gravely
the
count
winced
at
the
question
it
was
as
if
the
old
like
an
experienced
physician
had
put
his
finger
at
once
on
the
sore
spot
the
comtesse
s
husband
did
not
reply
well
said
gobseck
taking
the
pained
silence
for
answer
i
know
your
story
by
heart
the
woman
is
a
fiend
but
perhaps
you
love
her
still
i
can
well
believe
it
she
made
an
impression
on
me
perhaps
too
you
would
rather
save
your
fortune
and
keep
it
for
one
or
two
of
your
children
well
fling
yourself
into
the
whirlpool
of
society
lose
that
fortune
at
play
come
to
gobseck
pretty
often
the
world
will
say
that
i
am
a
jew
a
tartar
a
usurer
a
pirate
will
say
that
i
have
ruined
you
i
snap
my
fingers
at
them
if
anybody
insults
me
i
lay
my
man
out
nobody
is
a
surer
shot
nor
handles
a
rapier
better
than
your
servant
and
every
one
knows
it
then
have
a
friend
if
you
can
find
one
and
make
over
your
property
to
him
by
a
fictitious
sale
you
call
that
a
don
t
you
he
asked
turning
to
me
the
count
seemed
to
be
entirely
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
you
shall
have
your
money
he
said
have
the
diamonds
in
readiness
and
he
went
there
goes
one
who
looks
to
me
to
be
as
stupid
as
an
honest
man
gobseck
said
coolly
when
the
count
had
gone
say
rather
stupid
as
a
man
of
passionate
the
count
owes
you
your
fee
for
drawing
up
the
agreement
gobseck
called
after
me
as
i
took
my
one
morning
a
few
days
after
the
scene
which
initiated
me
into
the
terrible
depths
beneath
the
surface
of
the
life
of
a
woman
of
fashion
the
count
came
into
my
private
office
i
have
come
to
consult
you
on
a
matter
of
grave
moment
he
said
and
i
begin
by
telling
you
that
i
have
perfect
confidence
in
you
as
i
hope
to
prove
to
you
your
behavior
to
mme
de
grandlieu
is
above
all
praise
the
count
went
on
you
see
madame
that
you
have
paid
me
a
thousand
times
over
for
a
very
simple
matter
i
bowed
respectfully
and
replied
that
i
had
done
nothing
but
the
duty
of
an
honest
man
well
the
count
went
on
i
have
made
a
great
many
inquiries
about
the
singular
personage
to
whom
you
owe
your
position
and
from
all
that
i
can
learn
gobseck
is
a
philosopher
of
the
cynic
school
what
do
you
think
of
his
probity
m
le
comte
said
i
gobseck
is
my
benefactor
at
fifteen
per
cent
i
added
laughing
but
his
avarice
does
not
authorize
me
to
paint
him
to
the
life
for
a
stranger
s
speak
out
sir
your
frankness
can
not
injure
gobseck
or
yourself
i
do
not
expect
to
find
an
angel
in
a
daddy
gobseck
i
began
is
intimately
convinced
of
the
truth
of
the
principle
which
he
takes
for
a
rule
of
life
in
his
opinion
money
is
a
commodity
which
you
may
sell
cheap
or
dear
according
to
circumstances
with
a
clear
conscience
a
capitalist
by
charging
a
high
rate
of
interest
becomes
in
his
eyes
a
secured
partner
by
anticipation
apart
from
the
peculiar
philosophical
views
of
human
nature
and
financial
principles
which
enable
him
to
behave
like
a
usurer
i
am
fully
persuaded
that
out
of
his
business
he
is
the
most
loyal
and
upright
soul
in
paris
there
are
two
men
in
him
he
is
petty
and
great
a
miser
and
a
philosopher
if
i
were
to
die
and
leave
a
family
behind
me
he
would
be
the
guardian
whom
i
should
appoint
this
was
how
i
came
to
see
gobseck
in
this
light
monsieur
i
know
nothing
of
his
past
life
he
may
have
been
a
pirate
may
for
anything
i
know
have
been
all
over
the
world
trafficking
in
diamonds
or
men
or
women
or
state
secrets
but
this
i
affirm
of
him
never
has
human
soul
been
more
thoroughly
tempered
and
tried
when
i
paid
off
my
loan
i
asked
him
with
a
little
circumlocution
of
course
how
it
was
that
he
had
made
me
pay
such
an
exorbitant
rate
of
interest
and
why
seeing
that
i
was
a
friend
and
he
meant
to
do
me
a
kindness
he
should
not
have
yielded
to
the
wish
and
made
it
my
son
he
said
i
released
you
from
all
need
to
feel
any
gratitude
by
giving
you
ground
for
the
belief
that
you
owed
me
so
we
are
the
best
friends
in
the
world
that
answer
monsieur
gives
you
the
man
better
than
any
amount
of
i
have
made
up
my
mind
once
and
for
all
said
the
count
draw
up
the
necessary
papers
i
am
going
to
transfer
my
property
to
gobseck
i
have
no
one
but
you
to
trust
to
in
the
draft
of
the
which
will
declare
that
this
transfer
is
a
simulated
sale
and
that
gobseck
as
trustee
will
administer
my
estate
as
he
knows
how
to
administer
and
undertakes
to
make
over
my
fortune
to
my
eldest
son
when
he
comes
of
age
now
sir
this
i
must
tell
you
i
should
be
afraid
to
have
that
precious
document
in
my
own
keeping
my
boy
is
so
fond
of
his
mother
that
i
can
not
trust
him
with
it
so
dare
i
beg
of
you
to
keep
it
for
me
in
case
of
death
gobseck
would
make
you
legatee
of
my
property
every
contingency
is
provided
the
count
paused
for
a
moment
he
seemed
greatly
agitated
a
thousand
pardons
he
said
at
length
i
am
in
great
pain
and
have
very
grave
misgivings
as
to
my
health
recent
troubles
have
disturbed
me
very
painfully
and
forced
me
to
take
this
great
allow
me
first
to
thank
you
monsieur
said
i
for
the
trust
you
place
me
in
but
i
am
bound
to
deserve
it
by
pointing
out
to
you
that
you
are
disinheriting
your
other
children
they
bear
your
name
merely
as
the
children
of
a
wife
now
fallen
from
her
position
they
have
a
claim
to
an
assured
existence
i
tell
you
plainly
that
i
can
not
accept
the
trust
with
which
you
propose
to
honor
me
unless
their
future
is
the
count
trembled
violently
at
the
words
and
tears
came
into
his
eyes
as
he
grasped
my
hand
saying
i
did
not
know
my
man
thoroughly
you
have
made
me
both
glad
and
sorry
we
will
make
provision
for
the
children
in
the
i
went
with
him
to
the
door
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
a
glow
of
satisfaction
in
his
face
at
the
thought
of
this
act
of
justice
now
camille
this
is
how
a
young
wife
takes
the
first
step
to
the
brink
of
a
precipice
a
quadrille
a
ballad
a
picnic
party
is
sometimes
cause
sufficient
of
frightful
evils
you
are
hurried
on
by
the
presumptuous
voice
of
vanity
and
pride
on
the
faith
of
a
smile
or
through
giddiness
and
folly
shame
and
misery
and
remorse
are
three
furies
awaiting
every
woman
the
moment
she
oversteps
the
limits
poor
camille
can
hardly
keep
awake
the
vicomtesse
hastily
broke
go
to
bed
child
you
have
no
need
of
appalling
pictures
to
keep
you
pure
in
heart
and
camille
de
grandlieu
took
the
hint
and
went
you
were
going
rather
too
far
dear
derville
said
the
vicomtesse
an
attorney
is
not
a
mother
of
daughters
nor
yet
a
but
any
newspaper
is
a
thousand
times
poor
derville
exclaimed
the
vicomtesse
what
has
come
over
you
do
you
really
imagine
that
i
allow
a
daughter
of
mine
to
read
the
newspapers
go
on
she
added
after
a
pause
three
months
after
everything
was
signed
and
sealed
between
the
count
and
gobseck
you
can
call
him
the
comte
de
restaud
now
that
camille
is
not
here
said
the
vicomtesse
so
be
it
well
time
went
by
and
i
saw
nothing
of
the
which
by
rights
should
have
been
in
my
hands
an
attorney
in
paris
lives
in
such
a
whirl
of
business
that
with
certain
exceptions
which
we
make
for
ourselves
we
have
not
the
time
to
give
each
individual
client
the
amount
of
interest
which
he
himself
takes
in
his
affairs
still
one
day
when
gobseck
came
to
dine
with
me
i
asked
him
as
we
left
the
table
if
he
knew
how
it
was
that
i
had
heard
no
more
of
de
restaud
there
are
excellent
reasons
for
that
he
said
the
noble
count
is
at
death
s
door
he
is
one
of
the
soft
stamp
that
can
not
learn
how
to
put
an
end
to
chagrin
and
allow
it
to
wear
them
out
instead
life
is
a
craft
a
profession
every
man
must
take
the
trouble
to
learn
that
business
when
he
has
learned
what
life
is
by
dint
of
painful
experiences
the
fibre
of
him
is
toughened
and
acquires
a
certain
elasticity
so
that
he
has
his
sensibilities
under
his
own
control
he
disciplines
himself
till
his
nerves
are
like
steel
springs
which
always
bend
but
never
break
given
a
sound
digestion
and
a
man
in
such
training
ought
to
live
as
long
as
the
cedars
of
lebanon
and
famous
trees
they
then
is
the
count
actually
dying
i
asked
that
is
possible
said
gobseck
the
winding
up
of
his
estate
will
be
a
juicy
bit
of
business
for
i
looked
at
my
man
and
said
by
way
of
sounding
him
just
explain
to
me
how
it
is
that
we
the
count
and
i
are
the
only
men
in
whom
you
take
an
interest
because
you
are
the
only
two
who
have
trusted
me
without
finessing
he
said
although
this
answer
warranted
my
belief
that
gobseck
would
act
fairly
even
if
the
were
lost
i
resolved
to
go
to
see
the
count
i
pleaded
a
business
engagement
and
we
separated
i
went
straight
to
the
rue
du
helder
and
was
shown
into
a
room
where
the
countess
sat
playing
with
her
children
when
she
heard
my
name
she
sprang
up
and
came
to
meet
me
then
she
sat
down
and
pointed
without
a
word
to
a
chair
by
the
fire
her
face
wore
the
inscrutable
mask
beneath
which
women
of
the
world
conceal
their
most
vehement
emotions
trouble
had
withered
that
face
already
nothing
of
its
beauty
now
remained
save
the
marvelous
outlines
in
which
its
principal
charm
had
lain
it
is
essential
madame
that
i
should
speak
to
le
comte
if
so
you
would
be
more
favored
than
i
am
she
said
interrupting
me
m
de
restaud
will
see
no
one
he
will
hardly
allow
his
doctor
to
come
and
will
not
be
nursed
even
by
me
when
people
are
ill
they
have
such
strange
fancies
they
are
like
children
they
do
not
know
what
they
perhaps
like
children
they
know
very
well
what
they
the
countess
reddened
i
almost
repented
a
thrust
worthy
of
gobseck
so
by
way
of
changing
the
conversation
i
added
but
de
restaud
can
not
possibly
lie
there
alone
all
day
his
oldest
boy
is
with
him
she
said
it
was
useless
to
gaze
at
the
countess
she
did
not
blush
this
time
and
it
looked
to
me
as
if
she
were
resolved
more
firmly
than
ever
that
i
should
not
penetrate
into
her
secrets
you
must
understand
madame
that
my
proceeding
is
no
way
indiscreet
it
is
strongly
to
his
interest
i
bit
my
lips
feeling
that
i
had
gone
the
wrong
way
to
work
the
countess
immediately
took
advantage
of
my
slip
my
interests
are
in
no
way
separate
from
my
husband
s
sir
said
she
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
your
addressing
yourself
to
me
the
business
which
brings
me
here
concerns
no
one
but
le
comte
i
said
firmly
i
will
let
him
know
of
your
wish
to
see
the
civil
tone
and
expression
assumed
for
the
occasion
did
not
impose
upon
me
i
divined
that
she
would
never
allow
me
to
see
her
husband
i
chatted
on
about
indifferent
matters
for
a
little
while
so
as
to
study
her
but
like
all
women
who
have
once
begun
to
plot
for
themselves
she
could
dissimulate
with
the
rare
perfection
which
in
your
sex
means
the
last
degree
of
perfidy
if
i
may
dare
to
say
it
i
looked
for
anything
from
her
even
a
crime
she
produced
this
feeling
in
me
because
it
was
so
evident
from
her
manner
and
in
all
that
she
did
or
said
down
to
the
very
inflections
of
her
voice
that
she
had
an
eye
to
the
future
i
went
now
i
will
pass
on
to
the
final
scenes
of
this
adventure
throwing
in
a
few
circumstances
brought
to
light
by
time
and
some
details
guessed
by
gobseck
s
perspicacity
or
by
my
own
when
the
comte
de
restaud
apparently
plunged
into
the
vortex
of
dissipation
something
passed
between
the
husband
and
wife
something
which
remains
an
impenetrable
secret
but
the
wife
sank
even
lower
in
the
husband
s
eyes
as
soon
as
he
became
so
ill
that
he
was
obliged
to
take
to
his
bed
he
manifested
his
aversion
for
the
countess
and
the
two
youngest
children
he
forbade
them
to
enter
his
room
and
any
attempt
to
disobey
his
wishes
brought
on
such
dangerous
attacks
that
the
doctor
implored
the
countess
to
submit
to
her
husband
s
wish
mme
de
restaud
had
seen
the
family
estates
and
property
nay
the
very
mansion
in
which
she
lived
pass
into
the
hands
of
gobseck
who
appeared
to
play
the
fantastic
ogre
so
far
as
their
wealth
was
concerned
she
partially
understood
what
her
husband
was
doing
no
doubt
de
trailles
was
traveling
in
england
his
creditors
had
been
a
little
too
pressing
of
late
and
no
one
else
was
in
a
position
to
enlighten
the
lady
and
explain
that
her
husband
was
taking
precautions
against
her
at
gobseck
s
suggestion
it
is
said
that
she
held
out
for
a
long
while
before
she
gave
the
signature
required
by
french
law
for
the
sale
of
the
property
nevertheless
the
count
gained
his
point
the
countess
was
convinced
that
her
husband
was
realizing
his
fortune
and
that
somewhere
or
other
there
would
be
a
little
bunch
of
notes
representing
the
amount
they
had
been
deposited
with
a
notary
or
perhaps
at
the
bank
or
in
some
safe
following
out
her
train
of
thought
it
was
evident
that
de
restaud
must
of
necessity
have
some
kind
of
document
in
his
possession
by
which
any
remaining
property
could
be
recovered
and
handed
over
to
his
son
so
she
made
up
her
mind
to
keep
the
strictest
possible
watch
over
the
she
ruled
despotically
in
the
house
and
everything
in
it
was
submitted
to
this
feminine
espionage
all
day
she
sat
in
the
salon
adjoining
her
husband
s
room
so
that
she
could
hear
every
syllable
that
he
uttered
every
least
movement
that
he
made
she
had
a
bed
put
there
for
her
of
a
night
but
she
did
not
sleep
very
much
the
doctor
was
entirely
in
her
interests
such
wifely
devotion
seemed
praiseworthy
enough
with
the
natural
subtlety
of
perfidy
she
took
care
to
disguise
de
restaud
s
repugnance
for
her
and
feigned
distress
so
perfectly
that
she
gained
a
sort
of
celebrity
women
were
even
found
to
say
that
she
had
expiated
her
sins
always
before
her
eyes
she
beheld
a
vision
of
the
destitution
to
follow
on
the
count
s
death
if
her
presence
of
mind
should
fail
her
and
in
these
ways
the
wife
repulsed
from
the
bed
of
pain
on
which
her
husband
lay
and
groaned
had
drawn
a
charmed
circle
round
about
it
so
near
yet
kept
at
a
distance
but
in
disgrace
the
apparently
devoted
wife
was
lying
in
wait
for
death
and
opportunity
crouching
like
the
at
the
bottom
of
his
spiral
pit
ever
on
the
watch
for
the
prey
that
can
not
escape
listening
to
the
fall
of
every
grain
of
sand
the
strictest
censor
could
not
but
recognize
that
the
countess
pushed
maternal
sentiment
to
the
last
degree
her
father
s
death
had
been
a
lesson
to
her
people
said
she
worshiped
her
children
they
were
so
young
that
she
could
hide
the
disorders
of
her
life
from
their
eyes
and
could
win
their
love
she
had
given
them
the
best
and
most
brilliant
education
i
confess
that
i
can
not
help
admiring
her
and
feeling
sorry
for
her
gobseck
used
to
joke
me
about
it
just
about
that
time
she
had
discovered
maxime
s
baseness
and
was
expiating
the
sins
of
the
past
in
tears
of
blood
i
was
sure
of
it
hateful
as
were
the
measures
which
she
took
for
regaining
control
of
her
husband
s
money
were
they
not
the
result
of
a
mother
s
love
and
a
desire
to
repair
the
wrongs
she
had
done
her
children
and
again
it
may
be
like
many
a
woman
who
has
experienced
the
storm
of
lawless
love
she
felt
a
longing
to
lead
a
virtuous
life
again
perhaps
she
only
learned
the
worth
of
that
life
when
she
came
to
reap
the
woeful
harvest
sown
by
her
errors
every
time
that
little
ernest
came
out
of
his
father
s
room
she
put
him
through
a
searching
examination
as
to
all
that
his
father
had
done
or
said
the
boy
willingly
complied
with
his
mother
s
wishes
and
told
her
even
more
than
she
asked
in
her
anxious
affection
as
he
thought
my
visit
was
a
ray
of
light
for
the
countess
she
was
determined
to
see
in
me
the
instrument
of
the
count
s
vengeance
and
resolved
that
i
should
not
be
allowed
to
go
near
the
dying
man
i
augured
ill
of
all
this
and
earnestly
wished
for
an
interview
for
i
was
not
easy
in
my
mind
about
the
fate
of
the
if
it
should
fall
into
the
countess
hands
she
might
turn
it
to
her
own
account
and
that
would
be
the
beginning
of
a
series
of
interminable
lawsuits
between
her
and
gobseck
i
knew
the
usurer
well
enough
to
feel
convinced
that
he
would
never
give
up
the
property
to
her
there
was
room
for
plenty
of
legal
quibbling
over
a
series
of
transfers
and
i
alone
knew
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
matter
i
was
minded
to
prevent
such
a
tissue
of
misfortune
so
i
went
to
the
countess
a
second
time
i
have
noticed
madame
said
derville
turning
to
the
vicomtesse
and
speaking
in
a
confidential
tone
certain
moral
phenomena
to
which
we
do
not
pay
enough
attention
i
am
naturally
an
observer
of
human
nature
and
instinctively
i
bring
a
spirit
of
analysis
to
the
business
that
i
transact
in
the
interest
of
others
when
human
passions
are
called
into
lively
play
now
i
have
often
noticed
and
always
with
new
wonder
that
two
antagonists
almost
always
divine
each
other
s
inmost
thoughts
and
ideas
two
enemies
sometimes
possess
a
power
of
clear
insight
into
mental
processes
and
read
each
other
s
minds
as
two
lovers
read
in
either
soul
so
when
we
came
together
the
countess
and
i
i
understood
at
once
the
reason
of
her
antipathy
for
me
disguised
though
it
was
by
the
most
gracious
forms
of
politeness
and
civility
i
had
been
forced
to
be
her
confidant
and
a
woman
can
not
but
hate
the
man
before
whom
she
is
compelled
to
blush
and
she
on
her
side
knew
that
if
i
was
the
man
in
whom
her
husband
placed
confidence
that
husband
had
not
as
yet
given
up
his
fortune
i
will
spare
you
the
conversation
but
it
abides
in
my
memory
as
one
of
the
most
dangerous
encounters
in
my
career
nature
had
bestowed
on
her
all
the
qualities
which
combined
are
irresistibly
fascinating
she
could
be
pliant
and
proud
by
turns
and
confiding
and
coaxing
in
her
manner
she
even
went
so
far
as
to
try
to
subjugate
me
it
was
a
failure
as
i
took
my
leave
of
her
i
caught
a
gleam
of
hate
and
rage
in
her
eyes
that
made
me
shudder
we
parted
enemies
she
would
fain
have
crushed
me
out
of
existence
and
for
my
own
part
i
felt
pity
for
her
and
for
some
natures
pity
is
the
deadliest
of
insults
this
feeling
pervaded
the
last
representations
i
put
before
her
and
when
i
left
her
i
left
i
think
dread
in
the
depths
of
her
soul
by
declaring
that
turn
which
way
she
would
ruin
lay
inevitably
before
her
if
i
were
to
see
le
comte
your
children
s
property
at
any
rate
would
i
should
be
at
your
mercy
she
said
breaking
in
upon
me
disgust
in
her
gesture
now
that
we
had
spoken
frankly
i
made
up
my
mind
to
save
the
family
from
impending
destitution
i
resolved
to
strain
the
law
at
need
to
gain
my
ends
and
this
was
what
i
did
i
sued
the
comte
de
restaud
for
a
sum
of
money
ostensibly
due
to
gobseck
and
gained
judgment
the
countess
of
course
did
not
allow
him
to
know
of
this
but
i
had
gained
on
my
point
i
had
a
right
to
affix
seals
to
everything
on
the
death
of
the
count
i
bribed
one
of
the
servants
in
the
house
the
man
undertook
to
let
me
know
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
if
his
master
should
be
at
the
point
of
death
so
that
i
could
intervene
at
once
scare
the
countess
with
a
threat
of
affixing
seals
and
so
secure
the
i
learned
later
on
that
the
woman
was
studying
the
code
with
her
husband
s
dying
moans
in
her
ears
if
we
could
picture
the
thoughts
of
those
who
stand
about
a
deathbed
what
fearful
sights
should
we
not
see
money
is
always
the
of
the
schemes
elaborated
of
all
the
plans
that
are
made
and
the
plots
that
are
woven
about
it
let
us
leave
these
details
nauseating
in
the
nature
of
them
but
perhaps
they
may
have
given
you
some
insight
into
all
that
this
husband
and
wife
endured
perhaps
too
they
may
unveil
much
that
is
passing
in
secret
in
other
houses
for
two
months
the
comte
de
restaud
lay
on
his
bed
alone
and
resigned
to
his
fate
mortal
disease
was
slowly
sapping
the
strength
of
mind
and
body
unaccountable
and
grotesque
sick
fancies
preyed
upon
him
he
would
not
suffer
them
to
set
his
room
in
order
no
one
could
nurse
him
he
would
not
even
allow
them
to
make
his
bed
all
his
surroundings
bore
the
marks
of
this
last
degree
of
apathy
the
furniture
was
out
of
place
the
daintiest
trifles
were
covered
with
dust
and
cobwebs
in
health
he
had
been
a
man
of
refined
and
expensive
tastes
now
he
positively
delighted
in
the
comfortless
look
of
the
room
a
host
of
objects
required
in
illness
rows
of
medicine
bottles
empty
and
full
most
of
them
dirty
crumpled
linen
and
broken
plates
littered
the
chairs
and
an
open
lay
on
the
floor
before
the
grate
a
bath
still
full
of
mineral
water
had
not
been
taken
away
the
sense
of
coming
dissolution
pervaded
all
the
details
of
an
unsightly
chaos
signs
of
death
appeared
in
things
inanimate
before
the
destroyer
came
to
the
body
on
the
bed
the
comte
de
restaud
could
not
bear
the
daylight
the
venetian
shutters
were
closed
darkness
deepened
the
gloom
in
the
dismal
chamber
the
sick
man
himself
had
wasted
greatly
all
the
life
in
him
seemed
to
have
taken
refuge
in
the
still
brilliant
eyes
the
livid
whiteness
of
his
face
was
something
horrible
to
see
enhanced
as
it
was
by
the
long
dank
locks
of
hair
that
straggled
along
his
cheeks
for
he
would
never
suffer
them
to
cut
it
he
looked
like
some
religious
fanatic
in
the
desert
mental
suffering
was
extinguishing
all
human
instincts
in
this
man
of
scarce
fifty
years
of
age
whom
all
paris
had
known
as
so
brilliant
and
so
successful
one
morning
at
the
beginning
of
december
he
looked
up
at
ernest
who
sat
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
gazing
at
his
father
with
wistful
eyes
are
you
in
pain
the
little
vicomte
asked
no
said
the
count
with
a
ghastly
smile
it
all
lies
and
about
my
he
pointed
to
his
forehead
and
then
laid
his
wasted
fingers
on
his
hollow
chest
ernest
began
to
cry
at
the
sight
how
is
it
that
derville
does
not
come
to
me
the
count
asked
his
servant
he
thought
that
maurice
was
really
attached
to
him
but
the
man
was
entirely
in
the
countess
interest
what
maurice
and
the
dying
man
suddenly
sat
upright
in
his
bed
and
seemed
to
recover
all
his
presence
of
mind
i
have
sent
for
my
attorney
seven
or
eight
times
during
the
last
fortnight
and
he
does
not
come
he
cried
do
you
imagine
that
i
am
to
be
trifled
with
go
for
him
at
once
this
very
instant
and
bring
him
back
with
you
if
you
do
not
carry
out
my
orders
i
shall
get
up
and
go
madame
said
the
man
as
he
came
into
the
salon
you
heard
le
comte
what
ought
i
to
do
pretend
to
go
to
the
attorney
and
when
you
come
back
tell
your
master
that
his
man
of
business
is
forty
leagues
away
from
paris
on
an
important
lawsuit
say
that
he
is
expected
back
at
the
end
of
the
sick
people
never
know
how
ill
they
are
thought
the
countess
he
will
wait
till
the
man
comes
the
doctor
had
said
on
the
previous
evening
that
the
count
could
scarcely
live
through
the
day
when
the
servant
came
back
two
hours
later
to
give
that
hopeless
answer
the
dying
man
seemed
to
be
greatly
agitated
oh
god
he
cried
again
and
again
i
put
my
trust
in
none
but
for
a
long
while
he
lay
and
gazed
at
his
son
and
spoke
in
a
feeble
voice
at
last
ernest
my
boy
you
are
very
young
but
you
have
a
good
heart
you
can
understand
no
doubt
that
a
promise
given
to
a
dying
man
is
sacred
a
promise
to
a
father
do
you
feel
that
you
can
be
trusted
with
a
secret
and
keep
it
so
well
and
so
closely
that
even
your
mother
herself
shall
not
know
that
you
have
a
secret
to
keep
there
is
no
one
else
in
this
house
whom
i
can
trust
you
will
not
betray
my
trust
will
you
no
very
well
then
ernest
in
a
minute
or
two
i
will
give
you
a
sealed
packet
that
belongs
to
derville
you
must
take
such
care
of
it
that
no
one
can
know
that
you
have
it
then
you
must
slip
out
of
the
house
and
put
the
letter
into
the
at
the
yes
can
i
depend
upon
you
yes
come
and
kiss
me
you
have
made
death
less
bitter
to
me
dear
boy
in
six
or
seven
years
time
you
will
understand
the
importance
of
this
secret
and
you
will
be
well
rewarded
then
for
your
quickness
and
obedience
you
will
know
then
how
much
i
love
you
leave
me
alone
for
a
minute
and
let
no
one
no
matter
whom
come
in
ernest
went
out
and
saw
his
mother
standing
in
the
next
room
ernest
said
she
come
she
sat
down
drew
her
son
to
her
knees
and
clasped
him
in
her
arms
and
held
him
tightly
to
her
heart
ernest
your
father
said
something
to
you
just
yes
what
did
he
say
i
can
not
repeat
it
oh
my
dear
child
cried
the
countess
kissing
him
in
rapture
you
have
kept
your
secret
how
glad
that
makes
me
never
tell
a
lie
never
fail
to
keep
your
word
those
are
two
principles
which
should
never
be
oh
mamma
how
beautiful
you
are
have
never
told
a
lie
i
am
quite
once
or
twice
ernest
dear
i
have
lied
yes
and
i
have
not
kept
my
word
under
circumstances
which
speak
louder
than
all
precepts
listen
my
ernest
you
are
big
enough
and
intelligent
enough
to
see
that
your
father
drives
me
away
and
will
not
allow
me
to
nurse
him
and
this
is
not
natural
for
you
know
how
much
i
love
yes
the
countess
began
to
cry
poor
child
she
said
this
misfortune
is
the
result
of
treacherous
insinuations
wicked
people
have
tried
to
separate
me
from
your
father
to
satisfy
their
greed
they
mean
to
take
all
our
money
from
us
and
to
keep
it
for
themselves
if
your
father
were
well
the
division
between
us
would
soon
be
over
he
would
listen
to
me
he
is
loving
and
kind
he
would
see
his
mistake
but
now
his
mind
is
affected
and
his
prejudices
against
me
have
become
a
fixed
idea
a
sort
of
mania
with
him
it
is
one
result
of
his
illness
your
father
s
fondness
for
you
is
another
proof
that
his
mind
is
deranged
until
he
fell
ill
you
never
noticed
that
he
loved
you
more
than
pauline
and
georges
it
is
all
caprice
with
him
now
in
his
affection
for
you
he
might
take
it
into
his
head
to
tell
you
to
do
things
for
him
if
you
do
not
want
to
ruin
us
all
my
darling
and
to
see
your
mother
begging
her
bread
like
a
pauper
woman
you
must
tell
her
everything
ah
cried
the
count
he
had
opened
the
door
and
stood
there
a
sudden
apparition
almost
as
thin
and
fleshless
as
a
skeleton
his
smothered
cry
produced
a
terrible
effect
upon
the
countess
she
sat
motionless
as
if
a
sudden
stupor
had
seized
her
her
husband
was
as
white
and
wasted
as
if
he
had
risen
out
of
his
grave
you
have
filled
my
life
to
the
full
with
trouble
and
now
you
are
trying
to
vex
my
deathbed
to
warp
my
boy
s
mind
and
make
a
depraved
man
of
him
he
cried
hoarsely
the
countess
flung
herself
at
his
feet
his
face
working
with
the
last
emotions
of
life
was
almost
hideous
to
see
mercy
mercy
she
cried
aloud
shedding
a
torrent
of
tears
have
you
shown
me
any
pity
he
asked
i
allowed
you
to
squander
your
own
money
and
now
do
you
mean
to
squander
my
fortune
too
and
ruin
my
son
ah
well
yes
have
no
pity
for
me
be
merciless
to
me
she
cried
but
the
children
condemn
your
widow
to
live
in
a
convent
i
will
obey
you
i
will
do
anything
anything
that
you
bid
me
to
expiate
the
wrong
i
have
done
you
if
that
so
the
children
may
be
happy
the
children
oh
the
children
i
have
only
one
child
said
the
count
stretching
out
a
wasted
arm
in
his
despair
towards
his
son
pardon
a
penitent
woman
a
penitent
woman
wailed
the
countess
her
arms
about
her
husband
s
damp
feet
she
could
not
speak
for
sobbing
vague
incoherent
sounds
broke
from
her
parched
throat
you
dare
to
talk
of
penitence
after
all
that
you
said
to
ernest
exclaimed
the
dying
man
shaking
off
the
countess
who
lay
groveling
over
his
you
turn
me
to
ice
he
added
and
there
was
something
appalling
in
the
indifference
with
which
he
uttered
the
words
you
have
been
a
bad
daughter
you
have
been
a
bad
wife
you
will
be
a
bad
the
wretched
woman
fainted
away
the
dying
man
reached
his
bed
and
lay
down
again
and
a
few
hours
later
sank
into
unconsciousness
the
priests
came
and
administered
the
sacraments
at
midnight
he
died
the
scene
that
morning
had
exhausted
his
remaining
strength
and
on
the
stroke
of
midnight
i
arrived
with
daddy
gobseck
the
house
was
in
confusion
and
under
cover
of
it
we
walked
up
into
the
little
salon
adjoining
the
the
three
children
were
there
in
tears
with
two
priests
who
had
come
to
watch
with
the
dead
ernest
came
over
to
me
and
said
that
his
mother
desired
to
be
alone
in
the
count
s
room
do
not
go
in
he
said
and
i
admired
the
child
for
his
tone
and
gesture
she
is
praying
gobseck
began
to
laugh
that
soundless
laugh
of
his
but
i
felt
too
much
touched
by
the
feeling
in
ernest
s
little
face
to
join
in
the
miser
s
sardonic
amusement
when
ernest
saw
that
we
moved
towards
the
door
he
planted
himself
in
front
of
it
crying
out
mamma
here
are
some
gentlemen
in
black
who
want
to
see
you
gobseck
lifted
ernest
out
of
the
way
as
if
the
child
had
been
a
feather
and
opened
the
door
what
a
scene
it
was
that
met
our
eyes
the
room
was
in
frightful
disorder
clothes
and
papers
and
rags
lay
tossed
about
in
a
confusion
horrible
to
see
in
the
presence
of
death
and
there
in
the
midst
stood
the
countess
in
disheveled
despair
unable
to
utter
a
word
her
eyes
glittering
the
count
had
scarcely
breathed
his
last
before
his
wife
came
in
and
forced
open
the
drawers
and
the
desk
the
carpet
was
strewn
with
litter
some
of
the
furniture
and
boxes
were
broken
the
signs
of
violence
could
be
seen
everywhere
but
if
her
search
had
at
first
proved
fruitless
there
was
that
in
her
excitement
and
attitude
which
led
me
to
believe
that
she
had
found
the
mysterious
documents
at
last
i
glanced
at
the
bed
and
professional
instinct
told
me
all
that
had
happened
the
mattress
had
been
flung
contemptuously
down
by
the
bedside
and
across
it
face
downwards
lay
the
body
of
the
count
like
one
of
the
paper
envelopes
that
strewed
the
carpet
he
too
was
nothing
now
but
an
envelope
there
was
something
grotesquely
horrible
in
the
attitude
of
the
stiffening
rigid
limbs
the
dying
man
must
have
hidden
the
under
his
pillow
to
keep
it
safe
so
long
as
life
should
last
and
his
wife
must
have
guessed
his
thought
indeed
it
might
be
read
plainly
in
his
last
dying
gesture
in
the
convulsive
clutch
of
his
hands
the
pillow
had
been
flung
to
the
floor
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
i
could
see
the
print
of
her
heel
upon
it
at
her
feet
lay
a
paper
with
the
count
s
arms
on
the
seals
i
snatched
it
up
and
saw
that
it
was
addressed
to
me
i
looked
steadily
at
the
countess
with
the
pitiless
of
an
examining
magistrate
confronting
a
guilty
creature
the
contents
were
blazing
in
the
grate
she
had
flung
them
on
the
fire
at
the
sound
of
our
approach
imagining
from
a
first
hasty
glance
at
the
provisions
which
i
had
suggested
for
her
children
that
she
was
destroying
a
will
which
disinherited
them
a
tormented
conscience
and
involuntary
horror
of
the
deed
which
she
had
done
had
taken
away
all
power
of
reflection
she
had
been
caught
in
the
act
and
possibly
the
scaffold
was
rising
before
her
eyes
and
she
already
felt
the
felon
s
branding
iron
there
she
stood
gasping
for
breath
waiting
for
us
to
speak
staring
at
us
with
haggard
eyes
i
went
across
to
the
grate
and
pulled
out
an
unburned
fragment
ah
madame
i
exclaimed
you
have
ruined
your
children
those
papers
were
their
titles
to
their
her
mouth
twitched
she
looked
as
if
she
were
threatened
by
a
paralytic
seizure
eh
eh
cried
gobseck
the
harsh
shrill
tone
grated
upon
our
ears
like
the
sound
of
a
brass
candlestick
scratching
a
marble
surface
there
was
a
pause
then
the
old
man
turned
to
me
and
said
quietly
do
you
intend
mme
la
comtesse
to
suppose
that
i
am
not
the
rightful
owner
of
the
property
sold
to
me
by
her
late
husband
this
house
belongs
to
me
a
sudden
blow
on
the
head
from
a
bludgeon
would
have
given
me
less
pain
and
astonishment
the
countess
saw
the
look
of
hesitation
in
my
face
monsieur
she
cried
monsieur
she
could
find
no
other
words
you
are
a
trustee
are
you
not
i
asked
that
is
then
do
you
mean
to
take
advantage
of
this
crime
of
hers
i
went
at
that
leaving
the
countess
sitting
by
her
husband
s
bedside
shedding
hot
tears
gobseck
followed
me
outside
in
the
street
i
separated
from
him
but
he
came
after
me
flung
me
one
of
those
searching
glances
with
which
he
probed
men
s
minds
and
said
in
the
husky
pitched
in
a
shriller
key
do
you
take
it
upon
yourself
to
judge
me
from
that
time
forward
we
saw
little
of
each
other
gobseck
let
the
count
s
mansion
on
lease
he
spent
the
summers
on
the
country
estates
he
was
a
lord
of
the
manor
in
earnest
putting
up
farm
buildings
repairing
mills
and
roadways
and
planting
timber
i
came
across
him
one
day
in
a
walk
in
the
jardin
des
tuileries
the
countess
is
behaving
like
a
heroine
said
i
she
gives
herself
up
entirely
to
the
children
s
education
she
is
giving
them
a
perfect
bringing
up
the
oldest
boy
is
a
charming
young
fellow
that
is
but
ought
you
not
to
help
ernest
i
suggested
help
him
cried
gobseck
not
adversity
is
the
greatest
of
all
teachers
adversity
teaches
us
to
know
the
value
of
money
and
the
worth
of
men
and
women
let
him
set
sail
on
the
seas
of
paris
when
he
is
a
qualified
pilot
we
will
give
him
a
ship
to
i
left
him
without
seeking
to
explain
the
meaning
of
his
words
m
de
restaud
s
mother
has
prejudiced
him
against
me
and
he
is
very
far
from
taking
me
as
his
legal
adviser
still
i
went
to
see
gobseck
last
week
to
tell
him
about
ernest
s
love
for
mlle
camille
and
pressed
him
to
carry
out
his
contract
since
that
young
restaud
is
just
of
age
i
found
the
old
had
been
kept
to
his
bed
for
a
long
time
by
the
complaint
of
which
he
was
to
die
he
put
me
off
saying
that
he
would
give
the
matter
his
attention
when
he
could
get
up
again
and
see
after
his
business
his
idea
being
no
doubt
that
he
would
not
give
up
any
of
his
possessions
so
long
as
the
breath
was
in
him
no
other
reason
could
be
found
for
his
shuffling
answer
he
seemed
to
me
to
be
much
worse
than
he
at
all
suspected
i
stayed
with
him
long
enough
to
discern
the
progress
of
a
passion
which
age
had
converted
into
a
sort
of
craze
he
wanted
to
be
alone
in
the
house
and
had
taken
the
rooms
one
by
one
as
they
fell
vacant
in
his
own
room
he
had
changed
nothing
the
furniture
which
i
knew
so
well
sixteen
years
ago
looked
the
same
as
ever
it
might
have
been
kept
under
a
glass
case
gobseck
s
faithful
old
portress
with
her
husband
a
pensioner
who
sat
in
the
entry
while
she
was
upstairs
was
still
his
housekeeper
and
charwoman
and
now
in
addition
his
in
spite
of
his
feebleness
gobseck
saw
his
clients
himself
as
heretofore
and
received
sums
of
money
his
affairs
had
been
so
simplified
that
he
only
needed
to
send
his
pensioner
out
now
and
again
on
an
errand
and
could
carry
on
business
in
his
bed
after
the
treaty
by
which
france
recognized
the
haytian
republic
gobseck
was
one
of
the
members
of
the
commission
appointed
to
liquidate
claims
and
assess
repayments
due
by
hayti
his
special
knowledge
of
old
fortunes
in
san
domingo
and
the
planters
and
their
heirs
and
assigns
to
whom
the
indemnities
were
due
had
led
to
his
nomination
gobseck
s
peculiar
genius
had
then
devised
an
agency
for
discounting
the
planters
claims
on
the
government
the
business
was
carried
on
under
the
names
of
werbrust
and
gigonnet
with
whom
he
shared
the
spoil
without
disbursements
for
his
knowledge
was
accepted
instead
of
capital
the
agency
was
a
sort
of
distillery
in
which
money
was
extracted
from
doubtful
claims
and
the
claims
of
those
who
knew
no
better
or
had
no
confidence
in
the
government
as
a
liquidator
gobseck
could
make
terms
with
the
large
landed
proprietors
and
these
either
to
gain
a
higher
percentage
of
their
claims
or
to
ensure
prompt
settlements
would
send
him
presents
in
proportion
to
their
means
in
this
way
presents
came
to
be
a
kind
of
percentage
upon
sums
too
large
to
pass
through
his
control
while
the
agency
bought
up
cheaply
the
small
and
dubious
claims
or
the
claims
of
those
persons
who
preferred
a
little
ready
money
to
a
deferred
and
somewhat
hazy
repayment
by
the
republic
gobseck
was
the
insatiable
boa
constrictor
of
the
great
business
every
morning
he
received
his
tribute
eyeing
it
like
a
nabob
s
prime
minister
as
he
considers
whether
he
will
sign
a
pardon
gobseck
would
take
anything
from
the
present
of
game
sent
him
by
some
poor
devil
or
the
pound
s
weight
of
wax
candles
from
devout
folk
to
the
rich
man
s
plate
and
the
speculator
s
gold
nobody
knew
what
became
of
the
presents
sent
to
the
old
everything
went
in
but
nothing
came
out
on
the
word
of
an
honest
woman
said
the
portress
an
old
acquaintance
of
mine
i
believe
he
swallows
it
all
and
is
none
the
fatter
for
it
he
is
as
thin
and
dried
up
as
the
cuckoo
in
the
at
length
last
monday
gobseck
sent
his
pensioner
for
me
the
man
came
up
to
my
private
office
be
quick
and
come
derville
said
he
the
governor
is
just
going
to
hand
in
his
checks
he
has
grown
as
yellow
as
a
lemon
he
is
fidgeting
to
speak
with
you
death
has
fair
hold
of
him
the
rattle
is
working
in
his
when
i
entered
gobseck
s
room
i
found
the
dying
man
kneeling
before
the
grate
if
there
was
no
fire
on
the
hearth
there
was
at
any
rate
a
monstrous
heap
of
ashes
he
had
dragged
himself
out
of
bed
but
his
strength
had
failed
him
and
he
could
neither
go
back
nor
find
the
voice
to
complain
you
felt
cold
old
friend
i
said
as
i
helped
him
back
to
his
bed
how
can
you
do
without
a
fire
i
am
not
cold
at
all
he
said
no
fire
here
no
fire
i
am
going
i
know
not
where
lad
he
went
on
glancing
at
me
with
blank
lightless
eyes
but
i
am
going
away
from
i
have
said
he
the
use
of
the
technical
term
showing
how
clear
and
accurate
his
mental
processes
were
even
now
i
thought
the
room
was
full
of
live
gold
and
i
got
up
to
catch
some
of

come
papa
gobseck
no
weakness
be
yourself
he
raised
himself
in
bed
the
lines
of
his
face
standing
out
as
sharply
against
the
pillow
as
if
the
profile
had
been
cast
in
bronze
he
stretched
out
a
lean
arm
and
bony
hand
along
the
coverlet
and
clutched
it
as
if
so
he
would
fain
keep
his
hold
on
life
then
he
gazed
hard
at
the
grate
cold
as
his
own
metallic
eyes
and
died
in
full
consciousness
of
death
to
us
the
portress
the
old
pensioner
and
myself
he
looked
like
one
of
the
old
romans
standing
behind
the
consuls
in
lethiere
s
picture
of
the
of
the
sons
of
he
was
a
one
the
old
lascar
said
the
pensioner
in
his
soldierly
fashion
but
as
for
me
the
dying
man
s
fantastical
enumeration
of
his
riches
still
sounding
in
my
ears
and
my
eyes
following
the
direction
of
his
rested
on
that
heap
of
ashes
it
struck
me
that
it
was
very
large
i
took
the
tongs
and
as
soon
as
i
stirred
the
cinders
i
felt
the
metal
underneath
a
mass
of
gold
and
silver
coins
receipts
taken
during
his
illness
doubtless
after
he
grew
too
feeble
to
lock
the
money
up
and
could
trust
no
one
to
take
it
to
the
bank
for
him
run
for
the
justice
of
the
peace
said
i
turning
to
the
old
pensioner
so
that
everything
can
be
sealed
here
at
gobseck
s
last
words
and
the
old
portress
remarks
had
struck
me
i
took
the
keys
of
the
rooms
on
the
first
and
second
floor
to
make
a
visitation
the
first
door
that
i
opened
revealed
the
meaning
of
the
phrases
which
i
took
for
mad
ravings
and
i
saw
the
length
to
which
covetousness
goes
when
it
survives
only
as
an
illogical
instinct
the
last
stage
of
greed
of
which
you
find
so
many
examples
among
misers
in
country
towns
in
the
room
next
to
the
one
in
which
gobseck
had
died
a
quantity
of
eatables
of
all
kinds
were
stored
putrid
pies
mouldy
fish
nay
even
the
stench
almost
choked
me
maggots
and
insects
swarmed
these
comparatively
recent
presents
were
put
down
among
chests
of
tea
bags
of
coffee
and
of
every
shape
a
silver
soup
tureen
on
the
was
full
of
advices
of
the
arrival
of
goods
consigned
to
his
order
at
havre
bales
of
cotton
hogsheads
of
sugar
barrels
of
rum
coffees
indigo
tobaccos
a
perfect
bazaar
of
colonial
produce
the
room
itself
was
crammed
with
furniture
and
and
lamps
and
vases
and
pictures
there
were
books
and
curiosities
and
fine
engravings
lying
rolled
up
unframed
perhaps
these
were
not
all
presents
and
some
part
of
this
vast
quantity
of
stuff
had
been
deposited
with
him
in
the
shape
of
pledges
and
had
been
left
on
his
hands
in
default
of
payment
i
noticed
with
ciphers
and
armorial
bearings
stamped
upon
them
and
sets
of
fine
and
weapons
of
price
but
none
of
the
things
were
docketed
i
opened
a
book
which
seemed
to
be
misplaced
and
found
a
note
in
it
i
promised
myself
that
i
would
go
through
everything
thoroughly
i
would
try
the
ceilings
and
floors
and
walls
and
cornices
to
discover
all
the
gold
hoarded
with
such
passionate
greed
by
a
dutch
miser
worthy
of
a
rembrandt
s
brush
in
all
the
course
of
my
professional
career
i
have
never
seen
such
impressive
signs
of
the
eccentricity
of
avarice
i
went
back
to
his
room
and
found
an
explanation
of
this
chaos
and
accumulation
of
riches
in
a
pile
of
letters
lying
under
the
on
his
desk
gobseck
s
correspondence
with
the
various
dealers
to
whom
doubtless
he
usually
sold
his
presents
these
persons
had
perhaps
fallen
victims
to
gobseck
s
cleverness
or
gobseck
may
have
wanted
fancy
prices
for
his
goods
at
any
rate
every
bargain
hung
in
suspense
he
had
not
disposed
of
the
eatables
to
chevet
because
chevet
would
only
take
them
of
him
at
a
loss
of
thirty
per
cent
gobseck
haggled
for
a
few
francs
between
the
prices
and
while
they
wrangled
the
goods
became
unsalable
again
gobseck
had
refused
free
delivery
of
his
and
declined
to
guarantee
the
weights
of
his
coffees
there
had
been
a
dispute
over
each
article
the
first
indication
in
gobseck
of
the
childishness
and
incomprehensible
obstinacy
of
age
a
condition
of
mind
reached
at
last
by
all
men
in
whom
a
strong
passion
survives
the
intellect
i
said
to
myself
as
he
had
said
to
whom
will
all
these
riches
go
and
then
i
think
of
the
grotesque
information
he
gave
me
as
to
the
present
address
of
his
heiress
i
foresee
that
it
will
be
my
duty
to
search
all
the
houses
of
in
paris
to
pour
out
an
immense
fortune
on
some
worthless
jade
but
in

that
in
a
few
days
time
ernest
