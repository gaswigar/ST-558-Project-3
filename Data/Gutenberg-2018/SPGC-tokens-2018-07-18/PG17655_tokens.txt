i
my
first
day
the
sergeant
in
charge
of
the
clothing
store
was
curt
he
could
help
it
he
had
run
short
of
tunics
also
of
pants
except
three
pairs
which
would
fit
me
would
fit
anybody
unless
we
enlisted
three
very
fat
dwarfs
he
had
kept
on
asking
for
tunics
and
pants
and
sent
him
nothing
but
and
i
could
take
his
word
for
it
he
wished
he
was
at
the
front
he
did
instead
of
in
this
blessed
hole
filling
in
blessed
forms
for
blessed
clothes
which
never
came
impossible
anyhow
to
rig
me
out
i
was
going
on
duty
was
i
then
i
must
go
on
duty
in
my
civvies
it
was
a
disappointment
your
new
recruit
feels
that
no
small
item
of
his
reward
is
the
privilege
of
beholding
himself
in
khaki
the
escape
from
civilian
clothes
was
at
that
era
one
of
the
prime
lures
to
enlistment
i
had
attempted
to
escape
before
and
failed
now
at
last
i
had
found
a
branch
of
the
army
which
would
accept
me
it
needed
my
services
instantly
i
was
to
start
work
at
once
nothing
better
i
was
ready
this
was
what
i
had
been
seeking
for
months
past
but
i
confess
it
i
had
always
pictured
myself
dressed
as
a
soldier
the
postponement
of
this
bright
vision
for
even
hours
now
that
it
had
seemed
to
be
within
my
grasp
was
damping
however
the
had
told
me
that
i
was
to
go
on
duty
as
orderly
in
ward
w
an
ward
at
prompt
i
did
not
know
where
ward
w
was
i
did
not
know
what
a
functions
should
amount
to
and
i
had
no
uniform
i
was
attired
in
a
light
grey
lounge
suit
appropriate
enough
to
my
normal
habit
but
quite
too
flippant
i
was
certain
for
a
whatever
else
a
might
be
i
was
sure
that
he
was
not
the
sort
of
person
to
sport
a
grey
lounge
suit
still
i
must
hie
me
to
ward
i
had
got
my
wish
i
was
in
the
army
at
last
in
the
army
one
does
not
argue
one
obeys
so
having
been
directed
down
an
interminable
corridor
i
presented
myself
at
ward
on
entering
i
had
knocked
but
no
response
rewarded
this
courtesy
i
was
requested
by
a
sister
to
state
my
business
her
sternness
was
excusable
the
was
not
yet
and
in
my
unprofessional
guise
she
had
taken
me
for
a
visitor
my
explanation
dispelled
her
frowns
she
was
expecting
me
her
present
orderly
had
been
granted
three
days
leave
he
was
preparing
to
depart
i
was
to
act
as
his
substitute
before
he
went
he
would
initiate
me
into
the
secrets
of
his
craft
she
called
him
private
wood
private
wood
in
his
appeared
i
was
handed
over
to
him
herein
i
was
fortunate
though
i
was
unaware
of
it
at
the
time
private
wood
who
was
not
too
proud
to
wash
dishes
which
was
what
he
had
at
that
moment
been
doing
is
a
distinguished
sculptor
and
a
man
of
keen
imagination
at
a
subsequent
period
that
imagination
was
to
bring
forth
the
scheme
which
gained
him
his
commission
and
which
has
attracted
notice
from
experts
meanwhile
his
imagination
enabled
him
to
understand
the
exact
extent
of
a
novice
ignorance
the
precise
details
which
i
did
not
know
and
must
know
the
essential
apparatus
i
had
to
be
shown
the
knack
of
before
he
fled
to
catch
his
train
he
devoted
just
five
minutes
no
more
to
teaching
me
how
to
be
a
four
of
those
minutes
were
lavished
on
the
a
small
apartment
that
enshrines
cleaning
appliances
the
taps
of
which
if
you
turn
them
on
without
precautions
treat
you
to
an
involuntary
shower
bath
the
contains
a
selection
of
utensils
wherewith
every
orderly
becomes
only
too
familiar
their
correct
employment
a
theme
of
many
of
the
mildly
rabelaisian
jests
which
are
current
in
every
hospital
is
a
mystery
until
some
kind
mentor
like
private
wood
lifts
the
veil
in
four
minutes
he
had
told
me
all
about
the
and
all
about
all
the
gear
in
the
and
all
about
a
variety
of
rituals
which
need
not
here
be
dwelt
on
the
is
an
excellent
place
in
which
to
receive
a
private
lecture
the
fifth
minute
was
spent
in
introducing
me
in
another
room
the
ward
kitchen
to
mappin
the
a
is
attached
to
each
ward
and
most
wards
it
should
in
justice
be
added
are
attached
to
their
certainly
i
was
to
find
that
ward
w
was
attached
to
mappin
mappin
was
washing
up
private
wood
had
been
helping
her
the
completion
of
his
task
he
delegated
to
me
mappin
this
is
our
new
orderly
he
help
you
finish
the
private
wood
then
slid
into
his
tunic
snatched
his
cap
from
a
nail
in
the
wall
and
vanished
mappin
surveyed
me
ah
she
sighed
she
was
given
to
sighing
he
a
good
is
private
wood
the
inference
was
plain
there
was
little
hope
of
my
becoming
such
a
good
in
any
case
my
natty
grey
tweeds
were
against
me
one
could
never
make
an
orderliesque
impression
in
those
tweeds
better
take
your
jacket
off
sighed
mappin
i
did
so
chose
a
dishcloth
and
started
to
dry
a
pyramid
of
wet
plates
for
a
space
mappin
meditated
her
hands
in
soapy
water
then
she
withdrew
them
i
think
she
sighed
you
an
me
could
do
with
a
cup
of
tea
and
presently
i
was
having
tea
with
mappin
i
was
afterwards
to
learn
that
this
practice
of
calling
a
halt
in
her
labours
for
a
cup
of
tea
was
a
highly
incorrect
one
on
part
and
that
my
share
in
the
transaction
was
to
the
last
degree
reprehensible
but
i
was
also
to
learn
that
faithful
selfless
honest
and
diligent
are
none
too
common
and
the
sister
who
discovers
that
she
has
been
allotted
such
a
jewel
as
mappin
is
seldom
foolish
enough
to
exact
from
her
a
strict
obedience
to
the
letter
of
the
law
in
discipline
mappin
in
her
interludes
toiled
like
a
was
rigidly
punctual
and
never
complained
her
sighs
were
no
index
of
her
character
they
were
not
a
symptom
of
ennui
though
possibly
if
the
suggestion
be
not
rude
of
indigestion
caused
by
tannin
poisoning
she
was
the
of
creatures
it
is
a
fact
that
if
i
had
been
so
disposed
i
need
never
have
given
mappin
any
assistance
though
it
was
within
my
province
to
do
so
she
would
without
a
murmur
shoulder
other
people
jobs
as
well
as
her
own
having
finished
with
bearing
children
one
was
at
the
front
it
was
mappin
who
on
being
asked
the
whereabouts
of
her
soldier
son
said
in
france
i
do
rightly
know
the
place
is
but
she
had
settled
down
for
the
remainder
of
her
sojourn
on
this
plane
to
a
prospect
of
work
continuous
work
a
little
more
or
a
little
less
made
no
difference
to
her
she
had
nothing
else
to
do
but
work
nothing
else
to
be
interested
in
except
work
and
her
children
progress
and
her
cups
of
tea
her
ample
figure
concealed
a
warm
heart
behind
her
wrinkled
old
face
there
was
a
brain
with
a
limited
outfit
of
ideas
and
the
chief
of
those
ideas
was
our
cup
of
tea
was
refreshing
but
it
would
be
incorrect
to
convey
the
notion
that
i
was
allowed
to
linger
over
such
a
luxury
there
are
few
intervals
for
leisure
in
the
of
an
orderly
in
an
ward
had
the
sister
and
her
nurses
not
been
occupied
elsewhere
i
doubt
whether
i
should
have
been
free
to
drink
that
cup
of
tea
at
all
a
circumstance
of
which
perhaps
mappin
was
more
aware
than
i
at
any
rate
the
call
of
orderly
from
a
patient
summoned
me
from
the
kitchen
and
into
the
ward
long
before
i
had
finished
drying
dishes
the
patient
desired
some
small
service
performed
for
him
i
performed
it
remembering
to
address
him
as
sir
various
other
patients
observing
my
presence
took
the
opportunity
to
hail
me
i
found
myself
saying
yes
sir
in
a
moment
sir
and
dropping
with
a
promptitude
on
which
i
rather
flattered
myself
into
the
manner
of
a
cross
between
a
valet
and
a
waiter
with
a
subtle
dash
of
chambermaid
soon
i
was
also
a
staggering
to
a
taxi
with
the
ponderous
impedimenta
of
a
juvenile
second
lieutenant
who
was
bidding
the
hospital
farewell
and
whose
trunks
contained
at
a
guess
geological
specimens
and
battlefield
souvenirs
in
the
shape
of
dud
german
shells
this
young
gentleman
fumbled
with
a
gratuity
then
thought
better
of
it
and
was
gracious
enough
to
return
my
grin
bit
awkward
tipping
in
these
days
he
apologised
cheerily
depositing
himself
in
his
taxi
behind
ramparts
of
holdalls
thank
you
sir
seemed
the
suitable
adieu
and
having
proffered
it
i
scampered
into
the
ward
again
anon
sister
sent
me
with
a
message
to
the
dispensary
where
the
dispensary
was
i
knew
not
but
i
found
out
and
brought
back
what
she
required
then
to
the
post
office
another
exploration
down
that
terrific
corridor
post
office
located
at
last
and
duly
noted
then
to
the
linen
store
to
draw
attention
to
an
error
in
the
morning
supply
of
towels
linen
store
eventually
unearthed
likewise
the
information
that
its
staff
disclaimed
all
responsibility
for
mistakes
likewise
the
first
inkling
of
a
profound
maxim
that
when
a
mistake
has
been
made
in
hospital
it
is
always
the
orderly
and
no
one
else
who
has
made
it
engaged
on
these
errands
and
a
host
of
intervening
lesser
exploits
in
the
ward
i
had
to
cultivate
an
unwonted
fleetness
of
foot
i
flew
so
did
the
time
almost
immediately
as
it
seemed
to
me
i
was
bidden
to
serve
afternoon
tea
to
our
patients
the
distribution
of
of
cups
of
most
of
which
also
i
cut
the
a
little
more
tea
sir
or
a
pot
of
jam
in
your
locker
sir
behind
the
pair
of
trousers
yes
here
it
is
sir
the
laborious
feeding
of
a
patient
who
could
not
move
his
arms
all
these
occupied
me
for
a
breathless
hour
then
an
involved
struggle
with
a
patient
who
had
to
be
lifted
from
a
into
bed
i
had
never
lifted
a
human
being
before
then
a
second
bout
of
with
mappin
then
a
nominal
respite
for
my
own
tea
actually
ten
minutes
for
i
was
behindhand
then
all
too
soon
more
waitering
at
the
ceremony
of
dinner
this
time
with
the
complication
that
some
of
my
patients
were
allowed
wine
beer
or
spirits
and
some
were
not
burgundy
sir
sir
i
ran
round
the
table
of
the
patients
displaying
i
was
pleased
to
think
the
complete
aplomb
and
nimbleness
of
a
thoroughbred
swiss
pouring
out
drinks
with
concealed
envy
placing
and
removing
plates
handing
salt
bread
serviettes
after
which
back
to
mappin
and
her
renewed
mountain
of
crockery
it
was
long
after
my
own
supper
hour
had
come
and
gone
that
i
was
able
to
say
au
revoir
to
the
ward
the
cleansing
of
the
was
a
travail
which
alone
promised
to
last
half
the
night
mappin
eventually
lent
me
her
assistance
and
later
i
became
more
adroit
and
the
calls
of
orderly
from
the
bed
patients
were
interruptions
i
could
not
ignore
but
at
last
some
sort
of
conclusion
was
reached
mappin
put
on
her
bonnet
the
night
orderly
who
was
to
relieve
me
was
overdue
sister
discovering
me
still
in
the
kitchen
informed
me
that
i
might
leave
you
ai
any
supper
you
said
mappin
you
wo
get
none
now
neither
should
done
a
bunk
a
full
hower
back
you
should
she
drew
me
into
the
larder
and
indicated
the
debris
of
our
repast
a
leg
of
chicken
and
some
rice
pudden
only
wasted
if
do
it
but
is
it
allowed
i
was
in
truth
not
only
tired
but
ravenous
sister
entering
upon
this
conspiratorial
dialogue
unhesitatingly
gave
her
approval
cold
rice
pudding
and
a
leg
of
chicken
eaten
standing
at
a
shelf
in
a
larder
can
taste
very
good
indeed
even
to
the
wearer
of
a
grey
lounge
suit
i
shall
know
in
future
what
it
means
when
my
restaurant
waiter
emerges
from
behind
the
screened
furtively
wiping
his
mouth
i
sympathise
i
too
have
wolfed
the
choice
morsels
from
the
banquet
of
my
betters
ii
life
in
the
orderlies
huts
in
may
when
i
enlisted
the
weather
was
beautiful
consequently
the
row
of
tin
huts
to
which
i
was
introduced
as
my
future
address
for
the
duration
wore
an
attractive
appearance
the
sun
shone
upon
their
metallic
sides
and
roofs
the
shimmering
foliage
of
tall
trees
and
a
fine
field
of
grass
which
made
a
background
to
the
huts
were
fresh
and
green
and
restful
to
the
eye
even
the
foreground
of
earth
the
barrack
square
was
dry
and
clean
betraying
no
hint
of
its
quagmire
propensities
under
rain
later
on
when
winter
came
the
cluster
of
huts
could
look
dismal
especially
before
dawn
on
a
wet
morning
when
the
bugle
sounding
parade
had
dragged
us
from
warm
beds
or
in
an
afternoon
thaw
after
snow
when
the
corrugated
eaves
wept
torrents
in
the
twilight
and
one
feet
despite
the
excellence
of
army
boots
were
chilled
by
their
wadings
through
slush
meanwhile
however
the
new
recruit
had
nothing
to
complain
of
in
the
aspect
of
the
housing
accommodation
which
was
offered
him
merely
for
amusement
sake
he
had
often
roughed
it
in
quarters
far
less
comfortable
than
these
bare
but
huts
which
even
proved
on
investigation
to
contain
beds
an
unexpected
luxury
i
put
you
in
hut
said
the
there
one
empty
bed
it
the
hut
at
the
end
of
the
line
thereafter
hut
was
my
home
and
i
hope
i
may
never
have
a
less
pleasant
one
or
less
good
company
for
in
these
latter
i
was
perhaps
peculiarly
fortunate
but
that
is
by
the
way
it
suffices
that
twenty
men
not
one
of
whom
i
had
ever
seen
before
welcomed
a
total
stranger
and
both
at
that
moment
and
in
the
long
months
which
were
to
elapse
before
various
rearrangements
began
to
scatter
us
proved
the
warmest
of
friends
of
us
shared
our
downsittings
and
our
uprisings
in
hut
there
might
have
been
an
even
number
but
one
bed
place
was
monopolised
by
a
stove
which
in
winter
consumed
coke
and
in
summer
was
the
repository
of
old
newspapers
and
the
hut
accordingly
presented
a
vista
of
beds
eleven
along
one
wall
and
ten
along
the
other
the
stove
and
its
pipe
being
the
sole
interruption
of
the
symmetrical
perspective
above
the
beds
ran
a
continuous
shelf
bearing
the
equipment
or
at
least
that
portion
of
it
not
continually
in
use
below
each
bed
its
owner
box
and
his
boots
were
disposed
with
rigid
precision
at
an
exact
distance
from
the
box
and
boots
beneath
the
adjacent
bed
in
the
ceiling
hung
two
electric
lights
these
with
the
stove
beds
shelves
boxes
and
boots
constituted
the
entire
furniture
of
the
hut
unless
you
count
an
bought
by
public
subscription
and
notable
for
a
trick
of
tinkling
faintly
as
though
wanting
to
strike
but
failing
in
the
watches
of
the
night
hours
before
its
appointed
minute
had
arrived
the
hut
contained
no
other
furniture
whatever
and
in
those
days
did
not
seem
to
us
to
require
any
in
the
autumn
when
the
daylight
shortened
and
we
could
no
longer
hold
our
parliaments
on
a
bench
outside
a
couple
of
were
mysteriously
imported
and
as
the
authorities
remained
unshocked
a
small
table
also
appeared
and
was
squeezed
into
a
gap
beside
the
stove
some
sybarite
even
goaded
us
into
getting
up
a
fund
for
a
strip
of
linoleum
to
be
laid
in
the
aisle
between
the
beds
this
was
done
i
do
not
know
why
for
personally
i
have
no
objection
to
bare
boards
i
suppose
linoleum
is
easier
to
keep
clean
than
wood
and
that
aisle
tramped
on
incessantly
by
hobnail
boots
which
in
damp
weather
were
as
to
their
soles
and
heels
mere
bulbous
trophies
of
the
alluvial
deposits
of
the
neighbourhood
was
sometimes
far
from
speckless
but
to
me
the
strip
of
linoleum
made
our
hut
look
remotely
like
a
real
room
in
a
real
house
it
was
a
touch
of
the
conventional
which
i
never
cared
for
and
i
only
subscribed
to
it
when
i
had
voted
against
it
and
been
overborne
an
extraordinary
proposition
that
we
should
inaugurate
a
plant
in
a
pot
on
the
stove
lid
in
summer
was
i
am
glad
to
say
negatived
it
would
have
been
the
thin
end
of
the
wedge
we
might
have
arrived
at
japanese
fans
and
on
the
walls
not
that
our
company
officer
would
have
tolerated
any
nonsense
of
that
kind
punctually
at
after
the
second
parade
of
the
day
he
marched
through
each
hut
inspecting
it
and
calling
the
attention
of
the
to
any
detail
which
offended
his
sense
of
fitness
on
wet
mornings
instead
of
parading
outside
each
man
stood
to
his
cot
and
thus
the
comments
of
the
company
officer
as
he
went
down
the
aisle
were
audible
to
all
stiffly
drawn
up
to
attention
we
wondered
anxiously
whether
he
would
notice
anything
wrong
with
our
buttons
boots
or
belts
or
whether
he
would
spot
the
books
and
jam
jars
hidden
behind
our
overcoats
on
the
shelves
nothing
so
decadent
and
civilian
as
a
book
and
certainly
nothing
so
unsightly
as
a
jam
jar
must
be
visible
on
your
shelf
it
is
sacred
to
equipment
and
particularly
to
the
folded
the
art
of
folding
might
have
been
the
title
of
the
first
lesson
of
the
many
so
imparted
to
me
by
my
new
comrades
there
was
i
learnt
a
right
way
and
a
wrong
way
to
fold
all
things
foldable
the
for
instance
must
at
the
finish
of
its
foldings
when
it
is
placed
upon
the
exactly
middle
spot
above
your
bed
end
present
to
the
eye
of
the
beholder
a
kind
of
pyramid
whose
if
a
pyramid
can
be
said
to
own
a
waist
is
marked
by
the
belt
with
the
three
polished
buttons
peeping
through
the
belt
must
bulge
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
the
pyramidal
edifice
of
must
not
loll
it
must
sit
up
prim
and
firm
and
unless
all
your
foldings
of
the
from
first
to
last
have
been
deftly
precise
no
pyramid
will
reward
you
but
a
flabby
trapezium
the
belt
will
sag
its
buttons
wo
come
centrally
and
indeed
the
whole
edifice
of
unwieldy
cloth
will
topple
off
its
perch
on
the
narrow
shelf
which
was
designed
to
refuse
all
lodgment
for
the
property
of
persons
who
had
unsound
ideas
on
the
subject
of
compact
storage
the
second
series
of
folderies
to
which
the
novice
was
initiated
concerned
themselves
with
his
bedding
this
consisted
of
a
mattress
three
blankets
and
a
pillow
it
is
an
outfit
at
which
no
one
need
turn
up
his
nose
i
never
spent
a
bad
night
in
army
blankets
though
when
out
on
leave
i
am
sometimes
a
victim
of
insomnia
between
clean
cold
sheets
but
the
moment
the
réveillé
uplifted
you
from
your
couch
that
couch
had
to
be
made
according
to
rule
no
finicky
airing
the
mattress
must
be
rolled
up
with
the
pillow
as
its
core
and
placed
at
the
end
of
the
bed
on
top
of
it
a
blanket
folded
longwise
and
with
the
ends
hanging
down
was
laid
neatly
on
top
of
you
put
the
other
two
blankets
folded
quite
otherwise
then
you
brought
the
first
blanket
ends
over
and
reversed
the
resultant
bundle
and
pressed
it
down
into
a
thin
stratified
parallelogram
with
oval
ends
the
strata
of
the
said
parallelogram
viewed
from
the
aisle
must
show
no
blanket
only
curves
of
the
blankets
folds
the
edges
if
visible
at
all
must
face
inwards
not
outwards
correct
folding
to
be
sure
gave
no
visible
edges
viewed
from
either
side
and
once
you
caught
the
knack
correct
folding
was
just
as
easy
as
incorrect
though
there
were
temperaments
which
did
not
find
it
so
and
which
rebelled
against
these
niceties
i
was
afterwards
to
learn
that
this
mania
for
matching
if
mania
be
indeed
a
legitimate
word
for
a
custom
based
on
principles
and
seldom
carried
to
the
extremes
which
the
recruit
has
been
led
to
fear
obtains
not
only
in
the
army
but
also
in
the
nursing
profession
not
long
after
i
became
a
ward
orderly
i
got
a
wigging
from
my
sister
because
i
had
not
noticed
that
every
of
a
ward
beds
must
face
towards
the
same
point
of
the
compass
the
pillows
on
the
vista
of
beds
must
be
placed
in
such
a
manner
that
the
mouths
are
all
of
them
turned
away
from
anyone
entering
the
ward
door
similarly
the
overlap
of
the
counterpanes
must
all
be
of
exactly
the
same
depth
and
caught
up
at
exactly
the
same
angle
the
resulting
series
of
pairs
of
triangles
all
ending
at
exactly
the
same
spot
in
each
bedstead
these
trifles
reveal
at
a
glance
the
professional
touch
in
a
ward
and
are
i
understand
not
by
any
means
the
insignia
of
a
military
as
distinct
from
a
civilian
hospital
they
may
or
may
not
contribute
to
the
comfort
of
the
patient
but
they
betoken
the
captaincy
of
one
whose
methodicalness
will
in
other
and
less
visible
respects
most
emphatically
benefit
him
our
hut
life
was
something
more
than
a
mere
of
bedding
on
bedsteads
and
on
shelves
after
midday
dinner
it
was
allowable
to
unroll
the
mattress
make
the
bed
and
rest
thereon
which
most
of
us
by
that
time
having
been
on
the
run
since
parade
were
very
ready
to
do
there
was
half
an
hour
to
spare
before
parade
and
a
precious
it
was
snores
rose
from
some
of
the
beds
where
students
of
the
war
had
collapsed
beneath
the
newspapers
which
they
had
meant
to
read
desultory
conversation
enlivened
those
corners
where
the
denizens
of
the
hut
were
energetic
enough
to
polish
their
boots
or
sew
on
buttons
the
one
or
two
men
who
happened
to
be
going
out
on
pass
we
were
allowed
one
afternoon
per
week
were
putting
on
their
puttees
and
the
metal
buttons
of
their
tunics
otherwise
known
as
their
square
push
suits
the
buttons
of
their
working
tunics
had
of
course
been
burnished
before
parade
the
correct
employment
of
and
of
the
magic
cleaner
called
soldier
friend
the
polishing
of
one
boots
and
their
placing
on
the
floor
with
tied
laces
and
with
their
toes
in
line
with
the
bed
legs
the
substitution
of
lost
braces
buttons
by
bulldogs
the
furbishing
of
one
belt
the
of
the
front
of
one
cap
with
wads
of
paper
in
the
interior
of
the
crown
the
devices
whereby
puttees
can
be
coaxed
into
a
resemblance
of
spiral
ones
and
caused
to
ascend
in
corkscrews
above
trousers
which
refuse
to
tuck
unlumpily
into
one
socks
these
and
a
host
of
other
matters
always
kept
a
proportion
of
the
awake
and
busy
and
loquacious
even
in
the
somnolent
before
but
it
was
at
night
at
bedtime
that
the
hut
became
generally
sociable
sounded
at
and
at
we
were
all
scrambling
into
our
pyjamas
in
winter
our
disrobing
was
hasty
in
summer
it
was
an
affair
of
leisure
and
deshabille
roamings
to
and
fro
in
the
aisle
and
gossip
when
the
bugle
blew
and
the
electric
lights
suddenly
ceased
to
glow
leaving
the
hut
in
a
darkness
broken
only
by
the
dim
shapes
of
the
windows
and
the
red
of
many
of
us
still
had
to
complete
our
undressing
we
became
adepts
at
doing
this
in
the
dark
and
so
disposing
of
the
articles
of
our
attire
that
they
could
be
instantly
retrieved
in
the
morning
once
between
the
blankets
conversation
at
first
waxed
rather
than
waned
the
night
wardmaster
whose
duty
it
was
to
make
the
round
of
the
orderlies
huts
disapproved
of
conversation
after
and
was
apt
to
say
so
loudly
and
menacingly
when
he
surprised
us
by
popping
his
head
in
at
the
door
but
well
the
night
wardmaster
always
departed
in
the
long
run
and
then
uprose
between
bed
and
bed
those
unconclusive
debates
in
which
the
masculine
soul
delighteth
theology
woman
victuals
politics
art
the
press
sport
marriage
money
and
sometimes
even
the
war
likewise
the
purely
local
topics
of
sisters
and
their
absurdities
our
officers
the
other
huts
what
the
said
why
ca
replace
male
orderlies
what
this
morning
operations
looked
like
whether
an
officers
ward
or
a
men
ward
is
the
nicer
who
deserves
stripes
parade
and
its
terrors
advantages
of
volunteering
for
night
duty
the
cushy
job
of
being
in
charge
of
a
sham
lunacy
case
other
cushy
jobs
less
cushy
than
they
sounded
and
so
forth
until
at
last
protests
began
to
be
voiced
by
the
wearier
folk
who
wanted
silence
silence
it
was
except
for
the
thunder
of
occasional
passing
trains
in
the
railway
cutting
these
had
little
power
to
disturb
tucked
in
the
brown
army
blankets
which
at
first
sight
look
so
hard
and
so
prickly
we
slumbered
the
of
us
as
one
man
until
with
a
cruel
jolt
at
that
wretched
crashed
forth
its
summons
for
the
fastidious
few
who
liked
to
rise
in
ample
time
to
bath
and
shave
before
early
parade
sometimes
i
was
of
that
virtuous
band
and
sometimes
i
was
but
either
way
i
hated
the
at
though
not
so
virulently
as
did
those
members
of
the
hut
who
never
by
any
chance
dreamt
of
rising
until
five
to
six
these
gentry
had
reduced
the
ritual
of
dressing
and
of
rolling
up
their
bedding
to
a
speed
at
which
it
might
almost
be
compared
to
expert
juggling
the
quickness
of
the
hand
deceived
the
eye
at
five
minutes
to
six
you
would
see
the
juggler
asleep
on
his
pillow
in
blissful
innocence
at
six
he
would
be
on
parade
as
correctly
attired
as
you
were
yourself
and
having
left
behind
him
in
the
hut
a
bed
as
neatly
folded
as
yours
the
world
is
sprinkled
with
people
who
can
do
this
kind
of
thing
and
our
hut
was
blessed
with
its
due
leaven
of
them
but
i
would
not
assert
that
they
had
to
put
some
finishing
touches
either
to
their
dress
or
to
their
hut
equipment
foldings
before
the
company
officer
tour
of
inspection
at
it
sufficed
that
they
would
pass
muster
at
when
appearances
are
less
minutely
important
and
the
man
who
never
rises
till
detests
an
that
whirrs
at
the
hour
at
which
the
should
be
set
to
detonate
was
one
of
our
few
acrimonious
subjects
of
argument
i
have
even
known
it
upset
a
discussion
on
woman
but
the
early
risers
had
their
way
and
the
clock
continued
to
be
set
for
half
an
hour
in
front
of
réveillé
the
harsh
vibration
of
the
alarm
at
one
end
of
the
day
and
the
expiry
of
the
talks
at
the
other
these
events
marked
the
chief
in
our
hut
life
while
we
were
absent
at
work
our
interests
were
many
and
scattered
but
the
hut
was
a
nucleus
for
communal
bonds
of
union
which
evoked
no
little
loyalty
and
affection
from
us
all
on
the
may
morning
when
i
first
beheld
that
abode
i
thought
it
looked
inviting
enough
but
i
did
not
guess
how
fond
i
was
to
grow
of
its
interior
and
of
the
sportive
crew
who
shared
its
next
war
one
optimist
suggested
during
a
typical
séance
let
all
enlist
together
again
there
were
protests
against
the
implied
prophecy
but
none
against
the
proposition
as
such
that
is
the
spirit
of
hut
comradeship
a
spirit
which
no
controversies
can
do
aught
to
impair
for
though
is
an
hour
to
test
the
temper
of
a
troop
of
saints
will
bring
geniality
and
garrulousness
to
sinners
iii
the
following
substances
to
which
i
had
previously
been
almost
a
stranger
absorbed
much
of
my
interest
during
my
first
months
as
a
hospital
orderly
coagulated
pudding
mutton
fat
and
beef
fat
cold
gravy
treacle
congealed
cocoa
suet
duff
skins
of
once
hot
milk
plates
cups
and
other
utensils
smeared
with
the
above
knives
forks
and
spoons
ditto
i
am
fated
to
go
through
life
in
the
future
not
merely
with
an
exalted
opinion
of
this
i
should
not
regret
but
also
with
an
only
too
clear
picture
when
at
the
dinner
table
of
the
adventures
of
each
dish
of
broken
meats
on
its
exit
from
view
i
have
been
behind
the
scenes
at
the
business
of
eating
or
rather
at
the
dreadful
repairs
which
must
be
instituted
when
the
business
of
eating
is
concluded
in
order
that
the
business
of
eating
may
recommence
there
were
days
when
the
was
to
me
a
battlefield
and
i
seemed
to
be
fighting
on
the
losing
side
this
was
when
our
was
ill
or
had
got
the
sack
and
it
fell
to
me
the
orderly
to
do
the
those
patients
who
were
well
enough
to
be
on
their
feet
were
supposed
to
help
i
speak
of
a
men
ward
of
course
not
an
officers
they
did
help
and
that
right
willingly
sometimes
i
was
blessed
by
the
presence
of
a
patient
with
a
passion
for
cleaning
things
when
there
were
no
dishes
to
clean
he
would
clean
taps
when
the
taps
shone
like
gold
he
would
clean
the
hooks
on
the
dresser
when
all
our
kitchen
gear
was
clean
he
would
invade
with
a
kind
of
fury
the
and
clean
the
apparatus
there
when
this
was
done
he
would
clean
the
ward
windows
and
door
handles
he
would
clean
his
boots
and
shave
patients
in
bed
the
new
army
is
thickly
sown
with
men
like
that
they
are
the
salt
of
the
earth
i
would
place
them
at
the
summit
of
the
commonwealth
salary
list
the
bank
clerk
second
and
the
business
man
the
artist
and
the
politician
at
the
bottom
at
all
events
these
were
my
sentiments
when
a
patient
of
this
type
convalescing
began
to
be
able
to
help
me
with
my
kitchen
chores
but
it
occasionally
chanced
that
every
single
patient
in
the
ward
was
confined
to
bed
it
was
then
that
i
made
my
most
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
catalogue
of
horrors
i
have
cited
you
behold
me
with
my
rolled
up
faced
by
a
heap
of
twenty
plates
twenty
forks
twenty
knives
and
twenty
spoons
all
urgently
requiring
washing
were
these
my
whole
task
i
should
not
shrink
they
would
be
nicely
long
ere
arrived
the
time
when
i
should
but
probably
shall
not
be
able
to
leave
for
my
own
meal
in
the
orderlies
mess
but
there
are
two
far
more
serious
opponents
waiting
to
be
subdued
the
and
the
this
pair
are
hateful
beyond
words
their
memory
will
for
ever
haunt
me
a
spectral
disillusionment
to
spoil
the
relish
of
every
repast
i
may
consume
in
the
years
that
are
ahead
the
was
a
rectangular
box
some
three
feet
long
twenty
inches
wide
and
six
inches
deep
it
was
made
of
solid
metal
was
fitted
with
a
false
bottom
to
contain
hot
water
and
was
divided
internally
into
three
compartments
to
hold
meat
vegetables
and
duff
these
viands
were
loaded
into
the
tin
at
the
hospital
central
kitchen
i
had
naught
to
do
with
the
cookery
which
i
may
mention
always
seemed
to
me
to
be
excellent
my
sole
concern
was
with
the
of
the
food
to
the
patients
and
the
restoration
of
the
to
its
shelf
in
the
central
kitchen
for
unless
i
restored
that
tin
in
a
faultless
state
of
cleanliness
the
sergeant
in
charge
of
the
central
kitchen
would
require
my
blood
the
tin
number
would
betray
me
the
sergeant
needed
not
to
know
my
name
all
he
had
to
do
on
discovering
the
questionable
tin
was
to
glance
at
its
number
and
then
send
for
the
orderly
of
the
ward
with
a
corresponding
number
he
was
a
sergeant
whose
aspect
could
be
very
daunting
i
never
had
to
come
before
him
on
the
subject
of
a
dirty
but
he
and
i
had
some
small
passages
concerning
specials
separate
diets
ordered
for
patients
requiring
delicacies
sometimes
the
necessary
forms
for
the
specials
had
been
incorrectly
made
out
by
a
sister
with
no
head
for
army
accuracy
in
minor
clerical
details
thereafter
it
was
my
unlucky
place
to
see
the
sergeant
and
put
the
matter
straight
with
him
i
have
survived
those
encounters
i
have
survived
them
with
an
enhanced
respect
for
the
sergeant
and
the
organisation
of
his
large
and
by
no
means
simple
department
there
were
moments
nevertheless
when
i
approached
his
presence
with
a
sinking
heart
for
if
i
failed
to
get
round
him
in
the
matter
of
coaxing
another
special
for
a
patient
there
was
sister
to
placate
on
my
return
to
the
ward
and
it
was
quite
impossible
to
persuade
sister
that
she
could
have
made
a
mistake
with
her
diet
sheets
or
if
she
had
that
it
was
of
any
consequence
the
was
somewhat
larger
than
the
sink
in
which
i
was
supposed
to
wash
it
it
was
also
very
heavy
when
full
of
food
and
its
false
bottom
charged
with
hot
water
i
could
only
just
lift
it
and
my
progress
down
the
ward
carrying
it
from
the
trolley
in
the
corridor
to
the
was
a
perilous
and
perspiring
shuffle
as
soon
as
all
the
patients
had
been
served
i
placed
any
slices
of
meat
in
the
larder
these
would
be
eaten
at
tea
then
i
drained
out
the
hot
water
from
the
false
bottom
then
but
only
after
experience
had
given
me
wisdom
i
ran
hot
water
from
the
geyser
tap
into
the
now
empty
meat
vegetable
and
duff
compartments
and
gave
them
a
hurried
swill
this
to
rid
them
of
the
pestilent
dregs
of
fatty
material
which
would
otherwise
have
dried
and
glued
themselves
to
the
floor
of
the
tin
the
latter
had
now
to
be
put
on
one
side
for
i
must
be
back
in
the
ward
attending
to
my
diners
only
when
they
had
finished
their
meal
and
their
had
been
removed
folded
up
and
placed
neatly
behind
each
bed
could
i
tackle
the
tin
in
earnest
i
abhor
dabbling
in
grease
but
life
is
full
of
abhorrent
dilemmas
which
must
be
endured
and
the
interior
of
that
somehow
got
itself
cleaned
every
day
in
the
long
run
during
the
early
part
of
any
given
week
i
was
almost
happy
over
the
job
for
monday
was
dry
store
day
on
monday
and
on
monday
only
and
you
were
helpless
for
the
remainder
of
the
week
if
you
forgot
the
rule
you
could
obtain
on
presentation
of
a
chit
blacklead
for
the
stoves
for
the
brass
rags
for
cleaning
the
floor
one
box
of
matches
soft
soap
and
soda
it
is
an
extraordinary
chemical
soda
before
i
became
a
ward
orderly
i
had
no
idea
of
the
remarkable
properties
of
soda
a
handful
of
soda
in
boiling
water
and
behold
the
grease
dissolve
meekly
from
the
nastiest
it
was
miraculous
when
a
pitying
first
showed
me
the
trick
i
thought
that
all
my
troubles
were
at
an
end
soda
made
the
seem
like
heaven
alas
the
supply
of
soda
considered
sufficient
by
the
dry
store
authorities
never
lasted
beyond
wednesday
on
thursday
friday
saturday
and
sunday
the
had
to
be
cleaned
out
not
by
alkaline
agency
but
by
sheer
slogging
hard
labour
and
when
at
last
i
stood
it
on
edge
to
dry
and
thought
to
go
off
duty
with
a
clear
conscience
i
generally
found
that
i
had
overlooked
the
waiting
on
the
whole
i
am
inclined
to
pronounce
the
a
more
obdurate
utensil
than
even
the
the
however
only
appeared
every
second
morning
on
duff
days
duff
being
served
in
the
same
tin
as
the
meat
and
vegetables
though
in
a
separate
compartment
we
had
no
pudding
by
pudding
i
mean
milk
pudding
rice
or
sago
or
tapioca
now
a
milk
pudding
such
as
those
my
patients
received
though
perhaps
it
was
looked
askance
at
in
the
nursery
is
food
which
as
an
adult
i
am
far
from
despising
rice
pudding
i
have
come
with
maturer
years
to
regard
as
a
delicacy
sago
and
tapioca
i
still
eat
rather
with
amiable
resignation
than
from
choice
but
any
milk
pudding
as
i
now
know
has
a
most
vicious
habit
of
cleaving
to
the
dish
in
which
it
was
cooked
rice
is
the
least
evil
offender
the
others
are
absolutely
wicked
to
clean
oleaginous
scum
from
a
is
not
easy
but
it
is
a
mere
bagatelle
compared
with
cleaning
the
scorched
of
tapioca
or
sago
from
the
shores
of
a
large
metal
i
have
tried
scraping
with
a
knife
blade
i
have
tried
every
reasonable
form
of
friction
and
i
can
simply
state
as
a
fact
from
my
own
personal
experience
perhaps
i
am
unfortunate
that
those
metal
of
ours
would
frequently
yield
to
nothing
less
powerful
than
sandpaper
i
need
scarcely
say
that
sandpaper
was
not
supplied
by
the
deities
of
the
dry
store
sandpaper
did
not
come
within
their
purview
it
had
no
recognised
use
in
hospital
therefore
it
did
not
exist
but
observing
that
a
succession
of
metal
would
be
an
insupportable
prospect
without
sandpaper
i
laid
in
a
stock
of
sandpaper
paying
for
the
same
out
of
my
own
private
purse
it
was
a
cheap
investment
never
have
earnings
of
mine
been
better
spent
moreover
having
once
hit
on
the
notion
of
giving
myself
a
lift
illegitimately
so
to
speak
i
added
to
the
of
sandpaper
a
secret
purchase
of
soda
except
that
our
each
and
all
discovering
that
the
dry
allowance
of
this
priceless
chemical
had
at
last
apparently
been
generous
caused
it
to
fly
at
a
disconcerting
pace
and
as
a
result
sometimes
left
me
short
of
it
my
career
as
a
afterwards
became
more
comfortable
i
shall
never
like
in
the
communal
households
of
the
future
i
shall
heave
coal
sift
cinders
dig
potatoes
dust
furniture
or
scour
floors
any
task
will
be
mine
which
though
it
makes
me
dirty
does
not
make
me
greasily
dirty
but
if
i
must
if
i
must
study
the
idiosyncrasies
of
cold
fat
treacly
plates
which
have
sizzled
on
the
frozen
gravy
and
with
burnt
filmed
to
their
sides
i
shall
be
comparatively
undismayed
for
sandpaper
is
not
yet
like
the
news
posters
abolished
and
soda
although
i
hear
its
price
has
risen
several
hundred
per
is
still
cheaper
than
say
diamonds
iv
a
hut
hospital
people
have
curious
ideas
of
the
kind
of
building
which
would
make
a
good
war
hospital
the
club
in
pall
mall
i
have
been
told
should
have
been
commandeered
long
ago
ideal
for
hospital
purposes
of
course
some
of
the
members
brought
influence
to
bear
and
the
war
office
was
choked
off
and
so
forth
it
would
surprise
me
to
hear
of
anything
that
the
war
office
was
held
back
from
doing
if
it
wanted
to
do
it
perhaps
the
least
likely
obstructionist
to
be
successful
in
this
project
would
be
a
the
war
office
has
taken
exactly
and
precisely
what
it
chose
even
when
it
would
have
been
better
to
choose
otherwise
in
this
matter
of
commandeering
buildings
for
hospitals
it
may
or
may
not
have
acted
with
wisdom
but
at
least
it
has
been
safe
in
avoiding
the
advice
of
the
individual
who
jumps
to
the
conclusion
that
just
any
edifice
will
do
provided
beds
and
nurses
are
shovelled
into
it
in
sufficient
quantities
the
indignant
patriot
who
was
convinced
that
chicane
alone
saved
the
club
from
being
dedicated
to
the
service
of
the
wounded
was
quite
unable
to
tell
me
whether
the
lifts
assuming
that
lifts
existed
were
roomy
enough
to
accommodate
stretchers
whether
if
so
no
interval
of
stairs
prevented
trollies
from
being
wheeled
to
every
ward
whether
the
arrangement
of
the
building
would
allow
of
the
network
of
plumbing
necessitated
by
the
introduction
of
numerous
bathrooms
and
lavatories
for
each
ward
must
possess
both
whether
the
kitchens
were
so
located
that
they
could
supply
food
to
patients
without
waste
of
carrying
labour
on
the
part
of
the
orderlies
staff
these
problems
the
mere
fringe
of
the
subject
had
never
occurred
to
our
patriot
his
idea
of
a
hospital
was
a
place
where
soldiers
lie
in
bed
and
get
well
what
queer
notions
visitors
absorb
of
the
of
hospital
life
he
had
not
glimpsed
the
organisation
which
made
the
cure
possible
the
man
in
bed
a
sister
hovering
in
the
background
with
apparently
nothing
to
do
but
look
pleasant
these
constituted
for
him
the
final
phenomena
of
a
war
hospital
these
phenomena
instead
of
being
housed
in
a
shed
might
have
been
staged
picturesquely
in
one
of
the
luxurious
salons
of
the
club
in
pall
mall
it
was
a
shame
that
they
were
he
would
write
to
the
papers
about
it
somebody
must
be
blamed
somebody
must
be
made
to
hustle
and
meanwhile
the
sisters
and
doctors
who
installed
in
gorgeous
mansions
for
their
work
were
openly
envying
the
fortunate
ones
who
had
been
given
those
bare
but
efficient
and
sheds
some
years
ago
a
number
of
public
buildings
were
earmarked
for
hospital
use
in
case
of
war
it
may
surprise
the
indignant
patriots
to
learn
that
any
preparations
whatever
were
made
prior
to
the
outbreak
in
nevertheless
all
kinds
of
preparations
actually
were
made
mistakes
and
miscalculations
may
have
marred
those
preparations
the
fact
remains
that
as
far
as
the
territorial
medical
service
was
concerned
the
authorities
had
merely
to
press
a
button
and
hospitals
came
into
existence
thus
a
number
of
institutions
mostly
schools
found
themselves
ejected
from
their
own
found
in
short
what
many
other
folk
were
to
learn
later
that
the
state
is
omnipotent
in
and
that
sectional
interests
fade
into
insignificance
compared
with
the
interests
of
the
safety
of
the
commonwealth
some
conception
of
the
promptness
with
which
this
paper
scheme
of
sir
alfred
materialised
at
the
outbreak
of
war
may
be
gathered
from
the
simple
statement
that
the
building
of
which
i
myself
write
was
an
orphans
home
on
august
at
on
august
it
was
a
military
hospital
i
do
not
say
that
it
was
a
military
hospital
in
working
order
but
if
by
a
miracle
wounded
turned
up
then
there
was
at
least
a
staff
of
medical
officers
and
orderlies
on
the
premises
to
receive
them
in
point
of
fact
it
was
some
weeks
before
the
first
patients
arrived
those
weeks
however
were
not
idle
ones
the
layman
who
considers
that
any
large
building
can
be
turned
instantaneously
into
a
hospital
would
have
had
an
if
he
had
witnessed
the
work
done
here
the
mere
removing
of
per
cent
of
the
institution
furniture
was
a
colossal
task
added
thereto
was
the
introduction
of
hundreds
of
beds
hundreds
of
mattresses
hundreds
of
sets
of
bedclothes
hundreds
of
suits
of
pyjamas
hundreds
of
but
why
prolong
a
list
then
there
was
the
and
of
partitions
the
removal
of
every
single
window
for
replacement
by
hopper
sashes
the
of
bathrooms
lavatories
dispensary
cookhouse
pathological
laboratory
store
administration
offices
department
all
these
in
a
building
which
spacious
and
handsome
outwardly
was
as
to
its
interior
a
characteristic
maze
in
the
scottish
baronial
style
of
architecture
beloved
by
philanthropists
how
the
evicted
orphans
will
like
to
return
to
those
passages
and
large
airy
dormitories
after
having
experienced
the
comforts
of
the
banal
but
snug
suburban
villas
in
which
they
are
at
present
located
i
know
not
there
is
a
certain
dignity
about
the
scottish
baronial
pile
i
admit
the
silhouette
of
its
grey
stone
façade
rising
above
delightful
lawns
makes
a
good
impression
from
a
distance
postcard
views
of
it
sell
freely
to
visitors
but
the
best
part
of
our
hospital
is
hidden
behind
that
turreted
façade
and
is
much
too
ugly
and
utilitarian
for
postcard
immortalisation
the
best
part
of
our
hospital
hospital
to
most
of
us
came
into
being
when
the
commandeered
scottish
baronial
orphans
asylum
was
found
to
be
too
small
then
were
built
the
huts
the
word
hut
suggests
something
casual
of
the
order
a
shed
knocked
together
with
doubtfully
and
probably
scamped
by
profiteering
contractors
of
the
huts
provided
at
certain
training
centres
this
may
have
been
true
the
finely
austere
and
efficient
ranks
of
which
constitute
the
main
part
of
the
london
general
hospital
are
the
very
antithesis
of
that
picture
they
may
look
flimsy
they
were
certainly
put
up
at
a
remarkable
pace
i
myself
witnessed
the
erection
of
the
final
fifty
of
them
an
open
field
vanished
in
less
than
a
month
and
bungalow
town
as
someone
nicknamed
it
appeared
you
would
have
said
that
such
speed
meant
countless
imperfections
of
detail
no
doubt
some
tinkerings
and
modifications
were
bound
to
follow
when
the
regiment
of
workmen
carpenters
engineers
drainage
specialists
electricians
had
vanished
but
in
the
long
run
the
ideal
hospital
remained
a
hospital
with
which
the
club
in
pall
mall
for
all
its
luxuriousness
could
never
hope
to
compare
there
are
still
a
dozen
wards
used
mostly
for
medical
cases
in
the
scottish
baronial
building
its
rooms
too
provide
the
administration
with
offices
its
great
dining
hall
is
a
splendid
receiving
ward
for
the
and
clearance
of
convoys
of
patients
we
should
be
poorly
situated
indeed
if
we
had
not
our
scottish
baronial
main
building
to
be
the
hub
of
the
hospital
activities
or
rather
the
handle
from
which
springs
the
fan
of
the
hospital
great
extension
the
huts
approaching
the
hospital
the
visitor
sees
nothing
of
those
huts
as
he
walks
up
the
drive
he
flatters
himself
that
he
has
reached
his
destination
he
discovers
his
mistake
when
at
the
inquiry
bureau
in
the
entrance
he
is
informed
that
the
patient
whom
he
has
come
to
interview
is
say
in
c
he
is
advised
to
go
down
the
passage
on
his
left
turn
to
his
right
turn
to
the
left
again
and
then
again
to
the
right
after
which
he
had
better
seek
a
further
launching
himself
optimistically
on
this
voyage
he
learns
long
ere
he
has
attained
his
goal
that
a
modern
can
hide
a
considerable
extent
of
pedestrianism
behind
a
comparatively
short
scottish
baronial
frontage
he
will
be
fortunate
if
five
minutes
steady
tramping
brings
him
to
the
bedside
of
his
friend
in
c
perhaps
he
will
content
himself
in
his
footsoreness
by
noting
that
to
reach
c
he
has
not
had
to
go
up
or
down
any
stairs
this
is
one
of
the
beauties
of
the
hut
system
it
consumes
a
big
area
but
it
is
all
on
one
level
the
ground
level
the
patient
on
crutches
can
go
anywhere
without
fear
of
tripping
the
patient
in
a
wheeled
chair
can
propel
himself
anywhere
the
orderlies
can
push
wheeled
stretchers
or
anywhere
our
visitor
for
c
having
escaped
from
the
back
of
the
scottish
baronial
building
emerges
into
a
vista
of
covered
corridors
roofed
it
is
a
heartbreaking
vista
to

behold
thirty

between

is
a

the

of

at

there
is
no

in
the
continuous

of

all
down

a
special
type
of
window
which
even
when
open
declines
to
allow

to

in

of
these

the

is
not

very
well
lit

also
airy
and
odourless
when
all
the

are

is
the

throughout

an

at

a

is
spacious

not

the

because
he

the

sounds
unattractive

if
it

the
right
kind
of

he
is
in
the
soundest
and
most
sanitary
type
of

yet
devised
the
may
rattle

may
be
devoid

as

in

and
contemplates
that
unadorned
ceiling
he
is
a

better
off
than
if
he
were
gazing
at
the

cornices
of

if
you
walk
up
the
corridor
at
four
on
certain
afternoons
of
the
week
you
will
meet
a
mob
of
patients
trooping
from
their
wards
to
the
being
built
of
wood
and
corrugated
iron
the
corridor
is
an
echoing
cave
of
noises
it
echoes
the
tramp
of
feet
and
boots
were
not
soled
for
silence
it
echoes
the
of
crutches
it
echoes
the
slurred
rumble
of
wheeled
chairs
and
but
above
all
at
four
on
concert
days
it
echoes
happy
talk
and
chaff
and
boisterous
laughter
as
often
as
not
the
loudest

the
cheeriest
chaff
the
most
spontaneous

emanate
from
the
stalwarts
who
have
mustered
from

d

the
wards
for

here
they
come
a
string
of
them
mostly
with
bandages
round
their
heads
the
leading
man
owns
one
good
eye
a
twinkling
eye
an
eye
of
mischief
an
eye
you
would
guess
at
once
for
the
girls
but
the
owner
probably
calls
them
the
pushers
such
is
our
language
now
behind
him
in
single
file
and
in

with
him
march
a
gang
of
patients
each
with
his
hand
on
the

of

their
tread
is
purposely
thunderous
on
the
bare
boards
of

sing
as
they

it
is
a
ragtime
chorus
whose
most
memorable
line
runs
you
never
seem
to
kiss
me
in
the
same
place
twice
a
jaunty
lilt
to
be
sure
both
in

and
in

tramp

the

swerves
round

roaring
the

swerve
too
suddenly
the

is
encountered
emerging
from
her
room
fine
afternoon
matron
the
leader
interrupts
his
chant
to
utter
this
hearty
greeting
and
with
one
voice
fine
afternoon
matron
exclaim
his
followers
but
they
do
not
turn
their
heads
each
with
his
hand
resting
on
the
shoulder
of
the
man
in
front
they
go
steadily
on
towards
the
with
an
odd
intentness
glancing
neither
to
one
side
nor
the
other
for
though
at
their
leader
cue
they
have
hailed
the
matron
they
have
not
seen
her
they
are
blind
the
spectacle
of
men
particularly
young
men
who
have
given
their
sight
for
their
country
is
to
most
observers
a
moving
one
melancholy
are
the
reflections
of
the
visitor
who
meets
for
the
first
time
a
promenading
party
of
our
blind
patients
it
is
the
plain
truth
nevertheless
that
the
blind
men
themselves
are
far
from
melancholy
one
of
the
rowdiest
characters
we
ever
had
in
the
hospital
was
totally
blind
the
blind
men
wards
are
notoriously
amongst
the
least
sedate
i
offer
no
explanation
i
simply
state
the
fact
i
will
fortify
it
by
an
anecdote
it
came
to
pass
that
eight
complimentary
tickets
for
a
queen
hall
matinée
were
received
by
the
matron
who
in
due
course
allotted
them
to
seven
d
block
patients
an
orderly
detailed
to
take
them
to
the
hall
completed
the
octette
corporal
smith
the
orderly
in
question
recounted
his
adventures
afterwards
never
again
quoth
he
shall
i
jump
at
a
matinée
job
if
there
are
blind
chaps
in
the
party
they
the
deuce
you
must
understand
that
we
hospital
orderlies
regard
the
task
of
shepherding
patients
to
an
entertainment
in
town
as
an
agreeable
form
of
holiday
i
have
had
some
very
pleasant
outings
of
that
sort
myself
but
not
i
am
thankful
to
recall
in
the
light
of
corporal
narrative
with
blind
men
men
are
often
a
sufficient
care
in
manoeuvring
on
and
off
omnibuses
apparently
helpless
cripples
have
a
marvellous
gift
for
losing
themselves
entering
wrong
trains
and
generally
escaping
as
the
hour
for
return
draws
nigh
from
custody
and
the
city
seems
to
be
full
of
lunatics
ready
to
supply
alcohol
or
indigestible
refreshments
to
the
most
delicate
inmates
even
with
ordinary
patients
the
orderly
afternoon
excursion
is
sometimes
not
unfraught
with
anxiety
but
blind
patients
as
corporal
smith
said
are
the
deuce
out
of
his
party
four
were
totally
blind
two
could
recognise
dimly
the
difference
between
light
and
darkness
and
one
had
a
single
good
eye
queen
hall
was
reached
by
bus
without
mishap
after
the
performance
there
was
tea
at
an
shop
here
jock
one
of
the
totally
blind
men
a
scotchman
all
scots
are
jocks
in
the
army
distinguished
himself
by
facetiæ
audible
throughout
the
whole
shop
on
the
english
pronunciation
of
the
word
and
intimated
his
desire
to
treat
the
company
to
a
ballad
this
project
was
suppressed
but
a
silly
fool
in
a
top
hat
threatened
to
report
me
for
having
given
my
men
drink
said
corporal
smith
jock
gave
the
bird
not
but
i
thought
it
about
time
to
be
going
home
so
the
party
prepared
to
go
home
the
bus
was
voted
dull
somebody
suggested
the
tube
corporal
smith
consented
he
had
forgotten
that
at
oxford
circus
station
the
lifts
have
been
abolished
in
favour
of
sliding
staircases
confronted
by
the
escalator
corporal
smith
halted
his
party
and
informed
them
that
they
must
walk
down
by
the
ordinary
stair
the
escalator
was
not
safe
for
blind
men
unfortunately
jock
had
sniffed
a
lark
the
man
backed
him
up
the
party
elated
perhaps
by
their
tea
would
not
hear
of
anything
so
humdrum
as
a
descent
by
the
ordinary
stair
they
were
going
on
the
sliding
stair
they
insisted
corporal
smith
argued
in
vain
in
vain
he
exerted
his
purely
nominal
authority
his
charges
mocked
him
the
man
leading
with
jock
in
his
wake
they
launched
themselves
at
the
sliding
stair
in
sheer
desperation
corporal
smith
brought
up
the
rear
supporting
two
of
the
more
timid
venturers
as
best
he
might
none
of
the
group
except
corporal
smith
himself
as
it
turned
out
had
ever
travelled
on
an
escalator
before
but
they
had
heard
a
comic
song
about
a
sliding
stair
and
they
wished
jock
especially
to
sample
this
metropolitan
invention
by
dodging
forward
to
place
each
blind
man
hand
upon
the
banister
corporal
smith
managed
to
send
off
his
patients
without
a
stumble
but
as
the
stair
inexorably
lowered
them
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
he
realised
only
too
vividly
what
might
happen
at
the
foot
of
the
descent
the
evening
rush
of
passengers
had
begun
and
the
staircase
was
rather
crowded
nobody
seemed
to
realise
that
the
men
who
stood
so
still
upon
the
steps
were
not
the
usual
hospital
convalescents
out
on
leave
and
able
to
look
after
themselves
corporal
smith
delayed
by
one
man
who
had
hesitated
at
the
top
before
taking
the
plunge
beheld
his
charges
below
him
hopelessly
dotted
at
intervals
amongst
the
general
public
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
struggle
down
ahead
to
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
to
guide
the
men
off
as
they
arrived
this
task
he
hoped
would
be
adequately
performed
by
the
man
it
might
have
been
the
man
was
game
for
anything
but
jock
arriving
in
the
highest
good
humour
at
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
was
tilted
sideways
by
the
curve
and
promptly
sat
down
on
the
instead
of
rising
he
proclaimed
aloud
that
this
was
funnier
even
than
england
pronunciation
of
the
word
whereupon
various
hurrying
passengers
including
an
old
lady
tripped
over
his
prone
form
the
sensation
of
being
kicked
and
sat
upon
appealed
to
jock
sense
of
humour
the
more
people
avalanched
across
him
the
more
comic
he
thought
it
and
in
a
moment
there
was
quite
a
pile
of
wriggling
bodies
on
top
of
him
for
though
the
public
managed
on
the
whole
to
leap
over
or
circumvent
the
obstacle
presented
by
extremely
large
body
none
of
his
blind
comrades
did
so
every
single
one
of
them
fell
flop
said
corporal
smith
i
give
you
my
word
but
were
they
downhearted
no
they
regarded
this
mysterious
of
arms
and
legs
as
a
capital
jest
so
far
from
being
alarmed
or
annoyed
they
shouted
with
glee
the
old
lady
who
had
gathered
herself
together
and
was
directing
a
stream
of
voluble
reproof
at
corporal
smith
for
his
callousness
and
cruelty
to
these
unhappy
blind
heroes
retired
discomfited
jock
comments
routed
her
more
effectively
than
the
corporal
assurance
that
the
episode
was
none
of
his
choosing
the
party
at
last
sorted
itself
out
and
was
placed
upon
its
feet
once
more
it
was
excessively
pleased
with
its
exploit
hilarity
reigned
corporal
smith
relieved
made
ready
to
conduct
his
squad
to
the
platform
alas
a
bright
idea
occurred
to
jock
why
not
go
up
the
other
sliding
stair
and
down
again
agreed
at
least
corporal
smith
was
too
futile
to
be
worth
counting
i
had
to
go
with
the
blighters
said
he
there
was
no
end
of
a
crowd
by
this
time
and
jock
and
some
of
the
others
fell
over
at
the
top
again
and
there
was
a
row
with
the
and
people
kept
saying
they
report
me
and
when
i
got
my
party
down
to
the
bottom
for
the
second
time
and
some
of
the
tube
officials
had
come
and
said
they
could
allow
it
and
we
must
buzz
off
home
i
lined
the
fellows
up
to
march
to
the
train
and
dash
me
if
two
missing
they
given
me
the
slip
the
two
truants
it
may
be
added
could
not
be
found
corporal
smith
had
to
return
without
them
at
a
late
hour
of
the
evening
they
appeared
not
an
atom
repentant
at
the
hospital
having
persuaded
someone
to
put
them
into
the
correct
bus
one
of
them
jock
explained
that
being
from
the
north
he
had
desired
to
seize
this
opportunity
of
seeing
the
sights
of
london
jock
i
may
remind
you
is
totally
blind
jock
guide
the
man
who
had
volunteered
to
show
him
the
sights
and
who
had
only
once
been
in
london
before
could
see
very
faintly
the
difference
between
light
and
dark
thus
this
pair
of
irresponsibles
had
fared
forth
into
the
dusk
of
regent
street
it
sounds
a
very
horrible
fate
to
be
blinded
but
somehow
the
blind
men
themselves
seldom
seem
to
be
overwhelmed
by
its
horribleness
if
you
want
to
hear
the
merriest
banter
in
a
war
hospital
visit
the
blind
men
wards
the
pathos
of
them
lies
less
in
the
sadness
of
the
victims
than
in
the
triumphant
wonderful
fact
that
they
are
sad
i
wish
we
others
all
inhabited
the
same
mysteriously
jocund
spiritual
realm
as
jock
and
his
comrades
who
come
to
the
down
the
corridor
from
the
d
wards
vi
when
the
wounded
arrive
the
receiving
hall
of
the
hospital
is
its
clearing
house
of
patients
it
is
a
huge
room
with
a
lofty
and
echoing
roof
a
little
in
the
style
of
a
church
before
the
war
when
the
building
was
a
school
this
rather
grandiose
apartment
no
doubt
witnessed
speechifyings
and
prize
distributions
may
the
time
be
not
far
distant
when
it
will
once
again
be
used
for
those
observances
meanwhile
its
vast
floor
is
occupied
by
ranks
of
beds
those
beds
are
generally
untenanted
visitors
who
like
the
lady
in
the
play
have
taken
the
wrong
turning
are
apt
to
find
themselves
in
the
receiving
hall
and
gazing
at
its
array
of
vacant
beds
have
been
known
to
conclude
that
the
hospital
was
empty
as
if
any
in
these
times
could
be
empty
but
our
patients
have
only
a
short
acquaintanceship
with
the
beds
these
beds
are
momentary
on
their
journey
healthwards
they
are
not
meant
to
lie
in
but
to
lie
the
wards
for
which
the
receiving
hall
is
the
clearing
house
are
the
real
destination
of
the
patients
down
long
corridors
in
wards
far
cosier
because
less
ornate
than
this
the
patient
will
find
his
bed
ready
for
him
the
bed
which
he
is
not
to
lie
on
but
we
orderlies
meet
each
convoy
at
the
front
door
of
the
hospital
the
are
the
first
to
arrive
men
who
are
either
not
ill
enough
or
not
badly
enough
wounded
to
need
to
be
put
on
stretchers
in
ambulances
they
come
from
the
station
in
supplied
by
that
indefatigable
body
the
london
ambulance
column
the
alights
from
his
car
is
conducted
into
the
receiving
hall
and
ten
minutes
later
is
in
the
bathroom
for
the
ritual
of
the
bath
must
on
no
account
be
omitted
although
now
not
so
obviously
imperative
as
in
the
early
period
of
the
war
few
patients
reach
us
who
have
not
first
sojourned
either
for
a
day
or
two
or
for
weeks
in
hospitals
in
france
they
are
therefore
merely
as
you
or
i
might
be
after
coming
over
from
dublin
to
euston
the
bath
is
thus
a
pleasure
more
than
a
necessity
whereas
there
an
era
when
our
guests
came
straight
from
only
too
populous
trenches
baths
as
the
bathroom
orderly
was
nicknamed
had
to
be
circumspect
in
the
performance
of
his
job
the
few
minutes
which
the
spends
in
the
receiving
hall
are
occupied
in
drinking
a
cup
of
cocoa
and
in
having
his
particulars
taken
poor
soul
he

he
has
had
to

more

this
compendious
memoir
the

finishes
his
cocoa
picks
up
the
package
of
blues
which
has
been
put
at
his
side
and
departs
with
his
fellows
to
the
bathroom
here
he
is
tackled
by
the
pack
store
orderlies
who
take
from
him
and
enter
in
their
books
his
khaki
clothes
these
he
must
leave
in
exchange
for
the
blue
slop
uniform
which
is
to
be
his
only
wear
when
he
emerges
from
the
bathroom
he
is
attired
in
what
is
now
england
most
honourable
livery
the
royal
blue
of
the
patient
and
though
perhaps
the
matter
is
not
mentioned
to
him
in
so
many
words
his
own
suit
is
already
ticketed
with
an
identification
label
and
on
its
way
to
the
fumigator
this
is
no
reflection
on
the
owner
of
the
suit
but
there
are
some
things
we
do
talk
about
is
not
the
least
busy
of
the
more
retiring
members
of
a
staff
he
is
not
in
the
limelight
but
you
might
come
to
be
very
sad
and
sorry
if
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
neglect
his
unapplauded
part
the
are
still
splashing
and
dressing
in
the
bathroom
when
the
ambulances
with
the
begin
to
appear
now
is
the
busy
time
each
stretcher
must
be
quickly
but
gently
removed
from
the
ambulance
and
carried
into
the
receiving
hall
four
orderlies
haul
the
stretcher
from
its
shelf
in
the
ambulance
two
orderlies
then
take
its
handles
and
carry
it
indoors
at
the
entrance
to
the
receiving
hall
they
halt
the
medical
officer
bends
over
the
patient
glances
at
the
label
which
is
attached
to
him
and
assigns
him
to
a
ward
certain
types
of
cases
go
to
certain
groups
of
wards
the
attendant
sergeant
promptly
picks
a
metal
ticket
from
a
rack
and
lays
it
on
the
stretcher
the
ticket
has
punched
on
it
the
number
of
the
patient
ward
and
the
number
of
the
patient
bed
in
that
ward
this
ceremony
completed
the
orderlies
proceed
with
their
burden
up
the
aisle
between
the
beds
in
the
receiving
hall
arrived
at
the
bed
they
lower
their
stretcher
until
it
is
at
such
a
level
that
the
patient
if
he
is
active
enough
can
move
off
it
on
to
the
bed
if
he
is
too
weak
to
help
himself
he
is
lifted
on
to
the
bed
by
orderlies
under
the
direction
of
the
sister
the
stretcher
is
promptly
removed
and
restored
to
its
ambulance
if
the
patient
is
in
an
exceptionally
suffering
condition
he
is
not
placed
on
the
bed
instead
the
medical
officer
having
given
his
permission
his
stretcher
is
put
on
a
wheeled
trolley
and
he
is
taken
straight
away
to
his
ward
so
that
he
will
only
undergo
one
shift
of
position
between
the
ambulance
and
his
destination
the
majority
of
however
reach
us
in
a
by
no
means
desperate
state
for
as
i
say
they
seldom
come
to
england
without
having
been
treated
previously
at
a
base
abroad
except
during
the
periods
of
heavy
fighting
and
it
is
remarkable
how
often
the
patient
refuses
help
in
getting
off
the
stretcher
on
to
the
bed
he
may
be
a
cocoon
of
bandages
but
he
will
courageously
heave
himself
overboard
from
stretcher
to
bed
with
a
gay
which
would
be
deemed
rash
even
in
a
person
in
perfect
health
our
receiving
hall
at
a
big
intake
of
wounded
when
every
bed
bears
its
poor
victim
of
the
war
presents
a
spectacle
which
might
give
the
philosopher
food
for
thought
but
i
suspect
that
if
he
regarded
its
actualities
rather
than
his
own
preconceptions
what
would
impress
him
more
than
the
sadness
would
be
on
the
one
hand
the
kindliness
brisk
but
not
officious
of
the
staff
and
on
the
other
the
spontaneous
geniality
of
the
battered
occupants
of
the
beds
the
orderlies
can
spare
little
time
for
talk
but
the
few
chats
which
they
are
able
to
have
with
patients
whom
they
are
helping
to
change
their
clothes
or
to
whom
they
are
proffering
the
inevitable
cocoa
which
is
a
cocktail
as
it
were
prior
to
the
meal
which
will
be
served
in
the
men
own
ward
are
punctuated
by
jokes
and
laughter
rather
than
the
sympathy
which
the
outsider
might
quite
wrongly
have
pictured
as
appropriate
to
such
an
assemblage
the
before
he
is
taken
to
his
ward
must
also
give
his
particulars
must
also
be
interviewed
by
the
pack
store
officials
and
must
also
have
assigned
to
him
his
blue
uniform
wherewith
are
a
shirt
a
cravat
slippers
and
socks
in
anticipation
of
the
time
when
he
shall
be
able
to
use
his
feet
again
and
promenade
our
corridors
and
grounds
he
receives
the
customary
packet
of
cigarettes
probably
the
second
for
he
often
gets
one
at
the
railway
station
too
and
then
on
another
stretcher
mounted
on
a
trolley
is
wheeled
off
to
his
ward
here
bestowed
in
bed
at
last
we
leave
him
to
his
his
meal
his
and
chart
by
the
sister
his
visit
from
the
doctor
and
all
the
rest
of
it
for
the
moment
we
see
no
more
of
him
we
must
race
back
to
the
receiving
hall
and
if
there
are
no
more
patients
to
take
away
return
the
trolley
to
its
proper
nook
put
straight
the
blankets
and
pillows
on
the
beds
sweep
the
floor
and
tidy
up
generally
in
readiness
for
the
next
convoy
advent
presently
the
huge
room
beneath
its
dim
arched
ceiling
is
silent
and
empty
once
more
the
four
ranks
of
beds
without
a
crease
on
their
brown
blankets
are
bare
of
occupants
the
sister
and
her
probationers
have
vanished
the
pack
store
orderlies
have
carried
off
their
loot
of
dirty
khaki
tunics
and
trousers
for
the
fumigator
the
clerical
have
gone
to
enter
particulars
in
ledgers
and
the
cookhouse
people
have
removed
their
cocoa
urn
the
sergeant
is
inspecting
the
metal
left
in
his
rack
a
glance
at
them
tells
him
how
many
beds
and
which
beds
are
free
in
the
hospital
for
the
tickets
have
no
duplicates
any
given
ticket
can
only
reappear
in
the
rack
when
the
bed
which
it
connotes
is
out
of
use
and
awaiting
a
newcomer
the
ticket
hangs
from
a
nail
in
the
wall
beside
the
patient
bed
just
so
long
as
that
bed
is
tenanted
so
the
rack
of
metal
tickets
might
almost
take
the
place
of
that
important
document
of
which
a
edition
is
typed
every
morning
the
empty
bed
list
and
the
sergeant
is
meditative
as
he
sorts
into
the
rack
the
tickets
which
have
newly
been
sent
in
from
the
sisters
of
wards
where
there
have
been
departures
not
much
room
in
the
wards
he
ponders
or
a
lot
of
empties
in
the
medicals
and
then
the
tinkle
of
the
telephone
another
convoy
expected
at
twenty
and
seventeen
cots
right
you
are
and
at
the
party
of
orderlies
will
be
back
again
at
the
front
door
again
the
will
stream
up
the
drive
again
the
ambulances
will
come
with
their
stretchers
and
again
the
receiving
hall
will
awaken
from
its
interlude
of
silence
to
echo
with
the
activities
incidental
to
a
clearing
house
of
those
damaged
human
bundles
which
are
the
of
our
great
vii
t
a
patients
are
of
many
sorts
it
is
a
common
mistake
of
the
newspaper
devourer
to
lump
all
soldiers
together
as
quaint
bibulous
innocents
lamblike
and
gauche
in
fierce
and
picturesque
on
the
field
who
to
judge
by
their
published
photographs
are
continually
on
the
grin
and
continually
shaking
hands
either
with
each
other
or
with
equally
grinsome
french
peasant
women
at
cottage
doors
or
with
the
local
mayor
who
congratulates
them
on
the
glorious
which
of
course
they
are
continually
winning
in
a
war
hospital
that
harbours
many
thousands
of
patients
per
annum
we
should
know
in
the
long
run
something
about
the
characteristics
of
tommy
atkins
and
it
is
with
resentment
that
i
hear
him
thus
classified
as
a
mere
type
he
is
not
a
type
discipline
and
training
have
given
him
some
veneer
of
generalised
similarities
beneath
these
tommy
atkins
is
simply
the
man
in
the
street
any
man
in
any
street
and
if
you
look
out
of
your
window
in
the
city
and
see
a
throng
of
pedestrians
upon
the
pavement
you
might
just
as
well
say
that
because
they
are
all
civilians
they
are
all
alike
as
that
because
all
soldiers
wear
khaki
they
are
all
alike
i
have
a
quarrel
with
the
press
on
the
score
of
its
persistent
fostering
of
this
notion
that
our
gallant
lads
as
the
sentimental
scribe
calls
them
are
a
pack
of
children
about
whose
exploits
an
unfailing
stream
of
anecdotes
must
be
put
forth
even
the
old
professional
army
exhibited
no
dead
level
either
of
blackguards
on
the
one
hand
or
humble
galahads
on
the
other
but
whatever
may
have
been
the
case
before
the
war
all
the
armies
of
europe
are
now
alike
in
this
that
they
are
composed
of
civilians
who
merely
happen
to
have
adopted
a
certain
garb
for
the
performance
of
a
certain
job
and
be
it
remarked
a
temporary
job
that
garb
has
not
reduced
the
citizens
who
have
the
honour
to
wear
it
to
a
monotonous
level
either
of
intelligence
or
of
conduct
nor
even
of
opinions
about
the
war
itself
i
have
had
in
my
ward
who
breathed
the
sentiments
of
and
the
and
i
have
had
pacifists
they
seemed
to
have
fought
no
less
bravely
who
week
by
week
read
and
approved
snowden
in
the
i
have
had
radicals
and
tories
and
patients
who
cared
for
neither
party
but
whose
passion
was
or
boxing
or
amateur
photography
i
have
had
patients
who
were
sulky
and
patients
who
were
bright
patients
who
were
unlettered
and
patients
who
were
educated
patients
who
could
hardly
express
themselves
without
the
use
of
an
ensanguined
vocabulary
and
patients
who
were
gently
spoken
and
fastidious
each
of
them
was
tommy
atkins
the
inanely
smirking
hero
of
the
and
the
funny
paragraph
neither
his
picture
nor
the
paragraph
may
be
positively
a
lie
and
yet
when
the
dweller
chucklingly
draws
attention
to
them
i
am
tempted
to
relapse
into
irreverence
and
utter
one
or
other
or
perhaps
both
of
two
phrases
which
atkins
is
himself
credited
with
using
and
i
think
when
i
assert
as
i
do
unhesitatingly
assert
that
no
one
could
work
in
a
ward
for
any
length
of
time
without
an
respect
and
fondness
for
tommy
atkins
it
is
the
same
thing
as
asserting
that
the
respect
and
fondness
are
evoked
by
close
contact
with
countrymen
nothing
more
nor
less
a
hospital
ward
is
a
haphazard
selection
of
one
the
most
wildly
haphazard
it
is
possible
to
conceive
and
the
pessimistic
cynic
who
after
a
sojourn
in
that
changing
company
for
a
month
or
two
can
still
either
generalise
about
them
or
if
he
does
can
still
not
acknowledge
that
in
the
mass
they
are
amazingly
lovable
is
beyond
hope
the
war
has
taught
its
lessons
to
us
all
and
none
more
important
than
this
for
myself
i
confess
that
i
never
knew
before
how
nice
were
nine
out
of
ten
of
the
individuals
with
whom
i
sat
silent
in
trains
whom
i
glanced
at
in
business
offices
or
behind
counters
whom
i
saw
in
workshops
or
in
the
field
or
who
were
my
neighbours
in
they
were
strangers
in
the
years
to
come
i
hope
they
will
be
strangers
no
longer
for
they
and
i
have
dressed
alike
and
borne
the
same
surname
atkins
of
course
there
remain
a
few
generalisations
which
safely
be
risked
about
even
so
nondescript
a
person
as
the
new
tommy
atkins
as
practically
all
the
tommy
atkinses
are
at
this
moment
concentrated
on
the
prosecution
of
one
great
job
it
is
natural
that
their
main
interests
should
revolve
round
that
job
they
all
for
instance
want
the
job
to
be
finished
they
all
within
my
experience
want
it
to
be
finished
well
they
nearly
all
desire
earnestly
to
cease
soldiering
as
soon
as
the
job
finished
well
i
never
yet
met
the
man
though
he
may
exist
outside
the
brains
of
the
scribes
aforementioned
who
having
tasted
the
joys
of
roughing
it
is
determined
not
to
return
to
a
humdrum
desk
in
an
office
on
the
contrary
that
office
and
that
humdrum
desk
have
now
become
this
travelled
adventurer
most
roseate
dream
i
have
conversed
with
patients
drawn
from
nearly
every
walk
in
life
and
i
do
not
remember
one
who
definitely
spoke
of
refusing
to
go
back
to
his
former
work
if
he
could
get
it
one
of
my
patients
had
been
a
subterranean
lavatory
attendant
you
would
have
thought
his
ambitions
after
visits
to
egypt
malta
the
dardanelles
and
france
might
have
soared
to
loftier
altitudes
he
had
survived
adventures
he
had
taken
part
in
the
making
of
history
although
wounded
he
had
not
been
incapacitated
for
an
active
career
in
the
future
and
he
was
neither
illiterate
nor
unintelligent
yet
he
told
me
with
obvious
satisfaction
that
his
place
was
being
kept
open
for
him
i
was
as
it
were
invited
to
rejoice
with
him
over
the
destiny
which
was
his
i
may
add
that
the
singular
revelations
which
he
imparted
as
to
the
opportunities
for
extra
earnings
in
his
troglodyte
trade
extorted
from
me
a
more
enthusiastic
sympathy
than
might
be
supposed
possible
that
agreeable
domestic
pet
remains
unchanged
even
when
you
dress
him
up
in
a
uniform
and
set
him
fighting
he
is
always
consistently
inconsistent
he
is
always
both
reasonable
and
unreasonable
you
can
try
to
cast
him
in
a
mould
but
he
resumes
his
normal
shapelessness
the
moment
the
mould
is
removed
expose
him
to
frightful
ordeals
of
terror
and
pain
and
he
will
emerge
grumbling
about
some
petty
grievance
or
carrying
on
a
flirtation
with
another
man
wife
or
squabbling
about
sectarian
dogmas
or
gambling
on
magazine
competitions
or
planning
new
businesses
in
fact
behaving
precisely
as
the
natural
lord
of
creation
always
does
behave
no
member
of
our
hospital
staff
i
imagine
will
ever
forget
the
arrival
of
the
first
batch
of
exchanged
british
wounded
prisoners
it
was
the
most
tragic
scene
i
have
ever
witnessed
it
is
a
fact
for
which
i
make
no
apology
that
tears
were
shed
by
some
of
those
whose
task
it
was
to
welcome
that
pitiful
band
of
martyrs
we
had
received
convoys
of
wounded
many
a
time
but
broken
creatures
so
pale
so
neglected
so
thin
and
so
infinitely
happy
to
be
free
once
more
had
a
poignant
appeal
which
must
have
melted
the
most
rigid
official
and
we
are
neither
very
official
here
nor
very
rigid
well
amongst
these
liberated
captives
was
one
who
told
a
sad
tale
of
starvation
at
his
internment
camp
there
is
little
doubt
that
it
was
a
true
tale
in
the
main
on
that
i
make
no
comment
i
simply
introduce
you
to
this
gentleman
who
had
been
restored
to
his
native
land
after
ten
months
of
entombment
in
order
to
mention
that
on
the
following
morning
when
his
breakfast
was
placed
before
him
he
turned
up
his
nose
at
it
loudly
complaining
of
the
poorness
of
the
food
he
leant
out
of
bed
picked
up
a
parcel
which
had
been
his
only
luggage
and
produced
from
it
some
german
salted
herring
which
he
proceeded
to
eat
with
grumbling
gusto
that
is
not
specially
tommy
atkins
it
is
of
the
hearthside
whether
in
suburban
villa
or
in
slum
for
ever
dissatisfied
more
especially
with
his
victuals
and
for
ever
evoking
our
affection
all
the
same
no
tommy
atkins
is
never
twice
alike
he
is
unanimous
on
few
debatable
matters
one
of
them
as
i
have
said
is
the
desirability
of
finishing
the
war
in
the
proper
way
but
even
here
there
are
differences
as
to
what
constitutes
the
proper
way
another
is
i
trust
i
shall
not
shock
the
reader
the
extreme
displeasingness
of
life
at
the
front
i
would
not
say
that
our
hospital
patients
are
positively
thankful
to
be
wounded
nor
that
they
do
not
wish
to
recover
with
reasonable
rapidity
but
that
they
are
glad
to
be
safe
in
england
once
more
is
undeniable
the
more
honour
to
them
that
few
if
any
flinch
from
returning
to
duty
when
they
know
only
too
well
what
that
duty
consists
of
but
they
make
no
bones
about
their
opinion
not
long
ago
i
was
the
conductor
of
a
party
of
convalescents
who
went
to
a
special
matinée
of
a
military
drama
the
theatre
was
entirely
filled
with
wounded
soldiers
from
hospitals
plus
a
few
nurses
and
orderlies
it
was
an
inspiring
sight
the
drama
went
well
and
its
patriotic
touches
received
their
due
meed
of
applause
but
when
the
heroine
in
a
moving
passage
declared
that
she
had
never
met
a
wounded
british
soldier
who
was
not
eager
to
get
back
to
the
front
there
arose
in
an
instant
a
spontaneous
shout
of
laughter
from
the
whole
audience
that
was
tommy
atkins
unanimous
for
once
he
was
unanimous
too
i
should
add
in
perceiving
immediately
that
the
actress
had
been
disconcerted
by
his
roar
of
amusement
the
poor
emotional
speech
had
been
ruined
she
looked
blank
and
stood
irresolute
at
once
a
burst
of
took
the
place
of
the
laughter
it
was
not
ironical
it
was
friendly
and
apologetic
go
ahead
it
said
we
sorry
those
lines
are
your
fault
anyway
you
spoke
them
very
prettily
and
it
was
a
shame
to
laugh
but
the
ass
of
a
playwright
had
been
in
the
trenches
and
if
your
usual
audiences
relish
that
kind
of
speech
they
have
been
there
either
so
much
for
tommy
atkins
in
his
unanimous
mood
unanimously
condemning
cant
and
at
the
same
time
unanimously
courteous
now
that
i
come
to
reflect
i
believe
that
in
his
best
moments
these
are
perhaps
the
only
two
points
concerning
which
tommy
atkins
unanimous
whether
he
lives
up
to
them
or
not
and
to
expect
him
unflinchingly
to
live
up
to
them
in
season
and
out
of
season
is
about
as
sensible
as
to
expect
him
perpetually
to
live
up
to
the
photographs
and
anecdotes
we
may
take
them
as
his
ideal
he
dislikes
humbug
he
tries
to
be
polite
could
one
sketch
a
sounder
scaffolding
on
which
to
build
all
the
odd
divergencies
crankinesses
and
heroisms
stupidities
and
engagingnesses
which
may
go
to
make
the
edifice
of
an
average
decent
soul
material
mental
and
spiritual
habitation
an
expert
one
of
england
greatest
experts
who
has
read
the
above
tells
me
that
i
have
not
done
justice
to
the
old
professional
army
men
of
mons
and
the
aisne
when
wounded
and
in
our
hospital
they
want
to
go
back
to
fight
but
their
sole
reason
given
with
frankness
was
that
they
considered
they
were
needed
the
new
army
in
training
was
not
ready
it
would
be
murder
to
send
the
new
army
out
unprepared
to
such
an
ordeal
this
authority
who
has
interviewed
many
thousands
of
convalescents
further
remarked
the
wounded
man
who
has
been
under
shell
fire
and
who
professes
to
be
eager
to
go
back
whether
ordered
or
no
is
a
liar
on
the
other
hand
the
who
try
to
get
out
of
going
back
when
they
should
go
back
are
an
amazingly
small
minority
viii
laundry
problems
a
number
of
oddly
unmasculine
duties
fell
to
the
lot
of
the
orderly
prior
to
the
time
when
were
allowed
to
take
his
place
at
least
to
some
extent
throughout
our
english
one
of
my
first
tasks
in
the
morning
was
the
collecting
and
classification
of
my
ward
dirty
linen
the
work
can
not
be
called
difficult
it
would
be
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
it
demands
a
supreme
intellectual
effort
but
to
the
male
mind
it
is
at
least
rather
novel
the
average
bachelor
has
perhaps
been
accustomed
to
scrutinise
his
collars
handkerchiefs
and
underclothes
before
and
after
their
trips
to
the
laundry
he
has
seldom
i
think
had
intimate
trafficking
with
sheets
counterpanes
and
tablecloths
in
the
reckoning
of
these
he
is
apt
to
make
mistakes
and
to
lapse
into
a
casualness
which
in
a
woman
familiar
with
household
routine
would
be
improbable
sister
sharpest
reproofs
were
called
forth
by
errors
made
in
connection
with
this
daily
exchange
of
clean
for
dirty
linen
a
form
of
course
had
to
be
filled
in
the
army
provides
a
form
for
everything
this
form
presents
a
catalogue
of
separate
items
from
blankets
child
infant
i
do
not
know
what
is
the
difference
between
them
and
i
never
had
to
deal
with
either
whatever
that
may
be
and
white
to
strait
it
distinguishes
between
ten
kinds
of
cases
and
the
like
for
example
there
are
barrack
and
hospital
and
you
must
not
confound
hospital
with
officers
you
are
misled
if
you
imagine
that
the
heading
cases
has
exhausted
the
possibilities
which
appeared
to
be
latent
in
that
noun
for
in
addition
to
the
ten
unqualified
cases
there
are
seven
more
defined
as
cases
slip
can
you
wonder
that
the
orderly
presented
with
a
of
confused
and
crumpled
objects
ready
for
the
wash
and
told
to
count
them
and
enter
their
numbers
in
the
appointed
columns
occasionally
made
a
wrong
guess
then
there
were
eight
sorts
of
cloths
tablecloth
distinctive
cloth
and
so
forth
to
how
many
lay
minds
does
distinctive
cloth
convey
any
meaning
counterpanes
you
would
think
to
be
obvious
enough
but
that
remarkable
compilation
the
book
for
hospital
printed
for
stationery
office
etc
recognises
four
varieties
it
also
allows
for
four
varieties
of
sheets
four
of
aprons
and
four
of
trousers
of
towels
it
knows
six
each
ward
has
a
certain
stock
of
linen
in
its
cupboard
that
stock
can
only
be
kept
at
the
proper
level
by
strict
barter
of
a
soiled
object
for
a
clean
duplicate
of
the
same
object
as
there
are
three
hundred
and
days
in
the
year
on
which
this
transaction
occurs
and
sixty
wards
bundles
of
linen
to
be
dealt
with
by
both
the
dirty
linen
department
and
the
clean
linen
department
on
each
of
those
days
it
is
clear
that
exactitude
in
the
of
the
form
aforementioned
becomes
an
affair
of
almost
nightmare
importance
bring
back
from
the
clean
linen
store
three
dusters
instead
of
the
four
dusters
which
you
previously
handed
in
at
the
dirty
linen
store
and
your
cupboard
will
to
the
end
of
time
be
short
of
one
duster
which
it
should
have
possessed
even
if
sister
fails
to
pounce
promptly
on
the
evidence
of
the
loss
the
quartermaster
dread
stocktaking
will
ultimately
find
you
out
your
cupboard
declines
to
correspond
with
his
and
there
is
trouble
brewing
in
consequence
but
indeed
if
the
loss
of
a
single
duster
were
the
sole
crime
revealed
on
stocktaking
day
you
would
be
fortunate
the
orderly
with
an
obese
bundle
of
washing
on
his
back
plods
from
the
ward
to
the
dirty
linen
store
at
quarter
to
nine
every
morning
i
say
he
plods
because
the
bundle
is
generally
too
heavy
for
transportation
at
a
rapid
pace
twenty
sheets
are
usually
but
a
part
of
the
bundle
and
twenty
sheets
are
alone
no
light
burden
between
his
teeth
both
his
hands
being
occupied
with
the
balancing
of
the
bundle
he
carries
his
chit
that
indispensable
list
arrived
at
the
store
he
dumps
the
bundle
on
the
ground
opens
it
and
pitches
its
contents
piecemeal
over
a
counter
to
one
of
the
staff
of
the
store
one
by
one
the
objects
are
named
and
counted
aloud
as
they
fly
across
the
counter
the
staff
orderly
simultaneously
checking
the
list
and
keeping
an
eye
on
what
he
is
receiving
for
we
may
by
guile
palm
off
on
him
one
sheet
as
two
it
can
be
done
by
means
of
a
certain
legerdemain
which
comes
with
practice
or
we
may
have
received
from
the
dry
store
amongst
the
rags
meant
for
cleaning
purposes
a
couple
of
quite
socks
not
a
pair
and
long
past
placing
on
human
feet
these
derelicts
with
a
rapid
motion
can
be
passed
over
the
counter
amongst
the
good
socks
and
only
later
in
the
day
will
the
dirty
linen
store
officials
detect
the
fraud
when
it
is
impossible
to
locate
its
perpetrator
the
job
is
therefore
one
requiring
some
astuteness
his
checking
of
the
list
has
to
be
achieved
at
a
high
speed
and
in
the
midst
of
a
babel
for
as
many
are
present
as
the
length
of
the
counter
will
accommodate
and
they
are
all
getting
rid
of
their
bundles
at
the
tops
of
their
voices
altercations
i
am
afraid
were
not
infrequent
in
the
epoch
when
the
actors
in
this
drama
were
of
the
male
sex
even
now
when
the
scene
is
mainly
feminine
i
believe
differences
of
opinion
continue
to
arise
but
doubtless
the
language
in
which
they
are
conducted
is
seemlier
if
no
less
deadly
the
had
a
marvellous
eye
for
the
difference
between
two
kinds
of
shirts
which
are
worn
by
our
patients
one
kind
has
a
pleat
in
the
back
the
other
kind
has
and
i
confess
i
occasionally
transposed
them
on
the
form
it
was
fatal
to
do
so
there
was
a
separate
line
for
each
brand
of
shirt
and
there
must
be
a
separate
entry
the
trained
powers
of
observation
could
see
that
pleat
or
the
absence
of
it
even
as
the
shirt
slid
across
his
line
of
vision
in
a
torrent
of
other
shirts
his
hand
shot
out
and
grabbed
it
back
from
joining
the
heap
on
the
floor
within
the
counter
his
pencil
poised
itself
from
the
of
the
items
on
the
form
wrong
again
he
would
cry
sometimes
in
anguish
and
sometimes
in
anger
and
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
apologise
to
keep
on
good
terms
with
the
various
orderlies
in
the
various
stores
was
the
secret
of
making
one
life
worth
living
a
secret
even
profounder
than
that
of
keeping
on
good
terms
with
sister
to
be
sure
it
was
though
she
seldom
realised
it
the
very
foundation
of
the
art
of
keeping
on
good
terms
with
her
you
could
not
even
begin
to
please
sister
unless
at
the
end
of
those
incessant
journeyings
of
yours
which
she
did
not
see
you
had
dealings
with
who
were
obliging
and
who
would
give
you
the
things
which
the
taskmistress
had
sent
you
to
fetch
or
would
drop
a
kindly
hint
as
to
where
and
by
what
means
you
could
acquire
them
the
dirty
linen
store
orderly
who
declined
to
accept
your
plea
for
forgiveness
when
you
had
been
obtuse
enough
to
see
a
in
a
teacloth
could
devastate
the
harmony
of
a
whole
forenoon
a
sweet
reasonableness
was
undoubtedly
the
note
to
strike
when
such
a
contretemps
occurred
having
got
quit
of
the
last
item
in
your
bundle
you
returned
to
the
ward
to
attend
to
other
and
generally
less
entertaining
duties
until
such
time
as
it
was
proper
to
repair
to
the
clean
linen
store
the
staff
of
the
clean
linen
store
a
huge
department
whose
system
of
is
enough
to
make
the
brain
reel
for
here
sheets
are
dealt
with
not
in
dozens
but
in
thousands
had
in
the
interim
received
your
chit
from
their
colleagues
of
the
dirty
linen
store
these
latter
rashly
or
otherwise
had
guaranteed
its
accuracy
by
initialing
it
accordingly
in
the
clean
linen
store
a
fresh
bundle
was
ready
for
your
acceptance
its
contents
consisting
of
duplicates
of
the
objects
now
on
their
way
to
the
laundry
it
was
unwise
however
to
accept
this
neatly
folded
and
virginal
bundle
without
investigation
it
might
contain
what
the
chit
demanded
or
it
might
not
before
you
could
carry
it
off
you
must
yourself
initial
and
finally
bid
farewell
to
the
chit
thereby
certifying
that
you
had
got
what
you
claimed
to
make
sure
of
this
you
would
be
well
advised
to
undo
the
bundle
and
as
far
as
was
practicable
in
a
jostling
crowd
of
similarly
employed
run
through
the
whole
of
its
contents
computing
them
with
precision
twenty
sheets
twelve
nine
it
is
only
too
easy
to
miss
the
difference
in
the
sizes
of
these
seventeen
two
eleven
handkerchiefs
ten
pyjama
trousers
ten
and
so
on
when
you
had
all
these
separate
items
in
the
list
you
scribbled
your
initials
thereon
and
fled
with
your
bundle
to
find
as
often
as
not
that
sister
sorting
the
things
into
her
cupboard
could
discover
a
mistake
after
all
this
meant
a
humble
return
to
the
clean
linen
store
to
beg
for
the
mistake
rectification
and
the
sergeant
in
charge
had
merely
to
take
your
chit
from
his
file
and
show
you
your
own
initials
on
it
to
prove
that
you
were
in
the
wrong
it
is
conceivable
that
by
means
of
a
ward
stocktaking
and
a
reference
of
the
results
to
the
figures
in
the
sergeant
huge
ledger
you
might
have
proved
that
you
were
not
in
the
wrong
but
the
only
time
i
ever
knew
one
of
these
disputes
to
be
thus
put
to
the
test
i
admit
i
wished
that
i
had
refrained
from
so
temerarious
an
adventure
somehow
or
other
i
had
managed
to
come
back
to
the
ward
with
three
clean
fewer
than
the
tale
of
dirty
ones
i
had
taken
away
and
sister
was
exceedingly
cross
the
particular
sister
whose
drudge
i
was
at
that
period
was
rather
apt
to
be
cross
and
this
was
one
of
her
crossest
days
she
threatened
to
report
me
and
in
fact
did
so
i
was
not
as
she
seemed
to
expect
shot
at
dawn
i
merely
underwent
a
formal
reproof
from
a
high
authority
who
perhaps
but
this
is
a
surmise
knew
idiosyncrasies
even
better
than
i
did
there
remained
nevertheless
the
pressing
problem
of
the
three
strayed
these
sister
commanded
me
to
obtain
from
the
clean
linen
store
but
you
can
not
go
to
the
clean
linen
store
and
say
please
give
me
three
the
clean
linen
store
either
says
why
a
question
which
under
the
circumstances
is
flatly
unanswerable
or
else
tells
you
in
language
both
firm
and
ornamental
that
you
have
already
had
them
your
initialed
chit
testifies
the
fact
at
all
events
after
some
parley
the
clean
linen
store
sergeant
who
was
less
of
an
ogre
than
he
pretended
offered
to
strike
a
bargain
with
me
if
i
would
count
all
the
in
and
out
of
use
in
my
ward
and
bring
him
the
total
he
would
compare
the
said
total
with
the
figures
in
his
ledger
those
figures
he
would
not
divulge
to
me
but
if
the
number
i
announced
was
three
short
of
the
number
in
his
ledger
he
would
give
me
the
three
and
say
no
more
about
it
the
bargain
seemed
a
fair
one
in
sister
absence
i
spent
a
precious
of
what
should
have
been
my
afternoon
off
in
counting
all
the
i
could
find
in
the
ward
a
probationer
who
sympathised
with
me
in
my
difficulties
she
too
had
suffered
counted
them
also
a
convalescent
patient
interested
himself
in
the
problem
he
also
went
the
round
of
the
beds
and
investigated
the
cupboard
counting
all
the
we
three
each
arrived
at
the
same
total
armed
with
this
total
i
marched
back
to
the
sergeant
in
the
clean
linen
store
he
turned
up
his
ledger
and
ran
his
finger
down
the
page
till
he
came
to
the
entry
of
opposite
to
my
ward
and
then
he
laughed
a
laugh
of
fiendish
glee
do
you
know
he
said
that
instead
of
having
three
too
few
you
seven
too
many
such
are
the
traps
set
by
the
business
man
the
expert
of
ledgers
for
the
innocent
amateur
we
had
actually
got
more
than
we
were
entitled
to
all
unwittingly
in
my
eagerness
to
placate
sister
i
had
published
the
mild
chicanery
in
which
she
had
indulged
on
behalf
of
her
ward
the
sergeant
growing
grey
in
the
solution
of
these
abstruse
mathematical
and
psychological
mysteries
had
suspected
this
sister
all
along
he
enlightened
me
she
had
recently
been
transferred
from
another
ward
and
in
her
going
had
against
the
rules
wafted
with
her
a
small
selection
of
that
ward
property
and
now
there
would
be
a
surprise
stocktaking
in
her
new
ward
the
seven
surplus
and
perhaps
other
loot
would
have
to
be
explained
sister
in
short
was
in
for
a
quart
it
was
a
suitable
penalty
for
her
crossness
it
should
have
taught
her
the
perils
of
crossness
with
regret
i
add
that
she
did
not
envisage
the
episode
in
that
light
she
was
merely
rather
crosser
than
before
it
was
without
any
profound
sorrow
that
i
soon
afterwards
bade
her
farewell
on
her
departure
to
overseas
spheres
of
activity
but
she
had
at
least
afforded
me
a
lesson
in
the
importance
of
accuracy
over
my
dirty
and
clean
linen
bundles
never
again
would
i
risk
the
ordeal
of
a
surprise
stocktaking
never
again
would
i
risk
a
combat
with
a
sergeant
never
again
would
i
risk
any
attempt
at
the
tortuous
in
my
dealings
with
the
classifications
of
the
items
on
the
leaf
of
that
dire
volume
the
book
for
hospital
ix
on
buttons
in
one
of
his
recent
books
wells
expresses
a
surprised
annoyance
at
the
spectacle
of
spurs
vast
numbers
of
military
gentlemen
he
observed
at
the
front
go
clanking
about
in
spurs
although
they
have
never
had
and
never
will
have
occasion
to
bestride
a
horse
spurs
are
a
symbolic
survival
a
waste
of
steel
and
of
labour
in
manufacture
a
futile
expenditure
of
energy
to
keep
clean
and
to
put
on
and
take
off
when
i
first
enlisted
i
felt
a
similar
irritation
in
regard
to
buttons
his
buttons
are
a
burden
to
the
new
recruit
time
takes
the
edge
off
his
resentment
time
is
a
soother
of
sorrows
a
healer
of
rancours
however
legitimate
nevertheless
one
buttons
remain
for
ever
a
nuisance
i
do
not
complain
that
i
should
have
to
make
my
bed
polish
my
boots
keep
my
clothes
neat
these
are
the
obvious
decencies
of
life
but
the
daily
of
metal
buttons
which
need
never
have
been
made
of
metal
at
all
which
tarnish
in
the
damp
and
indeed
lose
their
lustre
in
an
hour
in
any
weather
which
moreover
look
much
prettier
dull
than
bright
this
is
enough
to
convert
the
most
bloodthirsty
recruit
into
obdurate
pacifism
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
in
the
days
of
peace
the
hours
were
apt
to
hang
heavy
in
barracks
and
the
furbishing
of
buttons
was
devised
not
alone
for
smartness
sake
but
to
occupy
idle
hands
for
which
otherwise
satan
might
be
finding
some
more
mischievous
employment
the
theory
though
it
throws
a
lurid
light
on
the
unprofitableness
of
a
soldier
profession
when
there
is
no
war
to
justify
his
existence
is
not
devoid
of
sense
but
why
this
custom
designed
for
that
excellent
mortal
the
atkins
who
walked
out
with
and
was
none
too
busy
should
be
forced
upon
a
totally
different
if
no
less
estimable
atkins
whose
job
hardly
gives
him
a
moment
for
meals
let
alone
for
dalliance
with
the
fair
i
can
not
pretend
to
fathom
it
is
arguable
that
the
ornamental
soldier
is
suited
by
glossy
buttons
and
may
properly
lavish
time
and
trouble
thereupon
it
is
not
arguable
that
glossy
buttons
are
a
valid
feature
of
the
garb
of
a
humdrum
and
harassed
hospital
orderly
many
a
time
footsore
and
aching
with
novel
toil
i
could
have
groaned
when
instead
of
lying
down
to
relax
i
had
to
tackle
the
polishing
of
that
idiotic
panoply
of
buttons
my
tunic
had
it
still
has
five
large
buttons
in
front
four
buttons
two
shoulder
buttons
and
two
shoulder
numerals
london
my
had
it
still
has
five
large
front
buttons
two
shoulder
buttons
and
two
shoulder
numerals
three
back
belt
buttons
two
buttons
my
cap
had
it
still
has
a
badge
and
two
small
all
these
must
be
kept
brilliant
and
in
addition
there
was
the
intricate
brasswork
of
one
belt
are
the
wounded
any
better
looked
after
because
a
tired
orderly
has
spent
some
of
his
in
rubbing
metal
buttons
which
would
have
been
every
bit
as
buttonable
had
they
been
made
of
bone
many
were
the
debates
in
our
hut
over
the
button
problem
the
abolition
of
metal
buttons
being
impracticable
the
bold
project
of
a
petition
to
the
king
and
lord
kitchener
was
never
proceeded
with
two
questions
alone
interested
us
which
was
the
best
polish
and
which
was
the
quickest
and
easiest
system
of
polishing
the
shabby
who
had
somehow
established
at
that
period
a
monopoly
of
the
minor
trade
of
our
camp
vended
a
substance
in
penny
tins
called
soldier
friend
this
was
a
solidified
of
a
pink
hue
having
as
per
the
instructions
moistened
it
in
other
words
spat
upon
it
you
worked
up
a
modicum
of
the
resulting
pink
mud
with
an
old
toothbrush
then
applied
same
to
each
button
when
you
had
rubbed
a
pink
film
on
to
the
button
you
proceeded
to
rub
it
off
again
and
lo
the
tarnish
had
departed
like
an
evil
dream
and
the
metal
glistened
as
if
fresh
from
the
mint
if
you
were
very
particular
you
finished
the
performance
with
chamois
leather
thereafter
you
lost
the
last
precious
five
minutes
before
parade
in
efforts
with
or
clothesbrush
to
remove
from
your
tunic
the
smears
of
pink
paste
which
had
failed
to
repose
on
the
buttons
and
had
stuck
to
the
surrounding
cloth
instead
luckily
soldier
friend
dries
and
cakes
and
powders
off
fairly
quickly
it
is
a
lovable
substance
in
its
simple
behaviour
its
lack
of
complications
i
surmise
that
somebody
has
made
a
fortune
out
of
manufacturing
millions
of
those
penny
tins
there
is
at
least
one
imitation
of
soldier
friend
on
the
market
and
like
most
imitations
it
is
neither
better
nor
worse
than
the
original
except
for
the
name
on
the
outside
of
the
tin
the
two
commodities
can
not
be
told
apart
no
doubt
the
imitator
has
likewise
made
a
fortune
if
so
both
fortunes
have
been
amassed
from
a
foible
to
whose
blatant
uselessness
and
wastefulness
even
a
bond
street
jeweller
or
a
hotel
chef
would
be
ashamed
to
give
countenance
one
member
of
the
hut
company
more
fastidious
than
his
fellows
objected
to
expectorating
on
to
his
soldier
friend
rather
than
do
so
he
would
tramp
the
fifty
yards
to
our
and
obtain
a
couple
of
drops
of
water
from
the
tap
the
same
man
thought
nothing
of
keeping
a
ham
some
decaying
fruit
and
an
opened
pot
of
bovril
all
wrapped
in
his
spare
clothes
in
his
box
under
his
bed
that
is
by
the
way
i
am
here
concerned
not
with
human
nature
but
with
buttons
plain
water
however
was
voted
less
effective
than
the
more
popular
liquid
the
scientifically
minded
had
a
notion
that
human
spittle
contained
some
acid
which
nature
had
evolved
specially
to
assist
the
action
of
soldier
friend
i
am
bound
to
say
that
i
was
of
the
party
myself
for
a
space
i
became
an
adherent
of
the
experimentalists
who
moistened
their
soldier
friend
with
methylated
spirit
alleging
that
the
ensuing
polish
was
more
permanent
i
lapsed
my
small
bottle
of
methylated
spirit
came
to
an
end
and
on
reflection
i
was
not
sure
that
its
superiority
over
spittle
had
been
proved
nothing
in
the
english
climate
can
make
the
sheen
of
metal
buttons
endure
at
the
outside
more
than
one
day
bluebell
silvo
and
the
other
preparations
in
favour
of
which
i
ultimately
abandoned
soldier
friend
are
alike
in
this
that
their
virtue
lies
in
frequent
application
diligence
and
they
are
every
one
excellent
their
inventors
deserve
our
gratitude
but
our
gratitude
to
their
inventors
must
be
nothing
compared
with
their
inventors
gratitude
to
the
person
who
decreed
that
the
atkins
of
the
great
war
should
wear
at
least
in
part
the
same
needless
finery
as
the
relatively
otiose
atkins
of
peace
may
that
despot
whoever
he
be
depart
to
a
realm
of
bliss
i
suppose
it
would
be
bliss
to
him
where
he
has
to
do
hospital
orderlies
chores
in
an
attire
completely
composed
of
tarnishing
buttons
every
separate
one
of
which
must
hourly
be
brought
up
to
the
parade
standard
of
specklessness
x
a
word
about
slackers
in
khaki
when
the
ambulances
containing
a
new
batch
of
wounded
begin
to
roll
up
to
the
entrance
of
the
hospital
they
are
received
by
a
squad
of
orderlies
to
a
spectator
who
happened
to
pass
at
that
moment
it
might
appear
that
these
orderlies
had
nothing
else
to
do
but
lift
stretchers
out
of
ambulances
and
carry
them
indoors
the
squad
of
orderlies
have
an
air
of
always
being
ready
on
duty
waiting
to
pounce
out
on
any
patient
who
may
arrive
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
and
promptly
transfer
him
to
his
bed
i
have
known
of
a
visitor
witnessing
this
incident
who
commented
on
it
in
a
manner
which
showed
that
he
imagined
he
had
seen
our
unit
performing
its
sole
function
he
pictured
us
existing
purely
and
simply
for
one
end
the
carrying
of
stretchers
up
the
front
steps
into
the
building
he
was
kind
enough
to
praise
the
rapidity
with
which
the
job
was
done
but
he
held
it
to
be
a
job
which
hardly
justified
the
enlistment
of
so
considerable
a
company
of
males
what
exactly
we
did
with
ourselves
during
the
long
hours
when
ambulances
were
arriving
he
failed
to
understand
i
suppose
he
pictured
us
twiddling
our
thumbs
in
some
kind
of
cosy
situated
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
front
door
from
whence
we
could
be
summoned
as
soon
as
another
convoy
hove
in
sight
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
quite
otherwise
arrivals
of
wounded
even
when
they
occur
several
times
a
day
i
have
known
six
hundred
patients
enter
the
hospital
in
hours
are
far
from
being
our
chief
preoccupation
admittedly
they
take
precedence
of
other
duties
the
message
convoy
coming
every
man
wanted
in
the
main
hall
is
the
signal
for
each
member
of
the
unit
who
is
not
engaged
in
certain
exempted
sections
to
drop
his
work
whatever
it
is
and
proceed
smartly
to
report
to
the
the
telephone
has
notified
us
of
the
hour
at
which
the
ambulances
may
be
expected
the
internal
telephone
system
has
passed
on
the
tidings
to
the
various
officials
concerned
and
five
minutes
before
the
patients
are
due
all
the
orderlies
likely
to
be
required
must
down
tools
so
to
speak
and
at
the
door
they
come
streaming
from
every
corner
of
the
hospital
and
of
its
grounds
some
have
been
working
in
wards
some
have
been
pushing
trollies
in
the
corridors
some
have
been
shovelling
coke
some
have
been
toiling
in
the
cookhouse
or
stores
some
have
been
shifting
loads
of
bedding
to
the
fumigator
some
have
been
on
sanitary
fatigue
some
have
been
cleaning
windows
or
whitewashing
walls
some
have
been
writing
or
typing
documents
some
have
been
spending
their
in
slumber
or
over
a
game
of
billiards
whatever
they
were
doing
they
must
stop
doing
it
at
the
word
of
command
if
the
convoy
be
a
large
one
its
advent
may
even
mean
for
the
orderlies
the
dread
announcement
all
passes
stopped
the
luckless
wight
whose
one
in
the
week
this
happens
to
be
and
who
has
probably
arranged
to
tryst
with
a
lady
friend
finds
at
the
gate
that
he
is
turned
back
by
the
sentry
in
vain
he
displays
his
pass
properly
signed
stamped
and
dated
the
telephone
has
warned
the
sentry
or
regimental
military
policeman
that
the
passes
have
been
countermanded
until
the
convoy
has
been
dealt
with
the
pass
is
so
much
waste
paper
and
the
unfortunate
orderly
inamorata
will
look
for
him
and
behold
him
not
how
many
painful
misunderstandings
this
all
passes
stopped
law
has
given
rise
to
one
shudders
to
guess
but
indeed
no
orderly
ever
arranges
any
appointment
without
the
proviso
that
he
is
liable
to
break
it
the
folk
who
imagine
that
the
hospital
orderly
enjoys
a
cushy
job
to
use
the
appropriate
vernacular
seldom
make
sufficient
allowance
for
this
painful
aspect
of
it
the
ordinary
soldier
in
training
in
an
english
camp
has
his
evenings
free
and
certain
other
free
times
which
are
nearly
as
sure
as
the
sun
rising
the
hospital
orderly
is
in
theory
at
any
rate
off
duty
his
free
moments
are
regarded
not
as
a
right
but
as
a
favour
no
freedom
at
any
time
can
be
guaranteed
he
is
liable
to
be
called
on
in
the
middle
of
the
night
or
at
the
instant
when
he
is
going
off
duty
or
when
at
a
meal
or
when
resting
or
when
on
the
point
of
walking
out
in
pursuance
of
the
gentle
art
of
courtship
and
he
must
respond
instanter
or
he
will
find
that
he
has
earned
the
which
in
this
instance
means
not
companion
of
the
bath
but
confined
to
barracks
a
punishment
as
hard
to
bear
as
the
cruel
keeping
in
of
our
without
presuming
to
compare
either
the
importance
or
the
onerousness
of
the
hospital
orderly
work
with
that
of
the
soldier
capable
of
going
to
the
front
to
fight
i
would
here
add
that
the
critic
who
watches
the
and
thinks
it
a
pity
that
males
should
be
wasted
on
it
is
doing
the
system
not
to
mention
the
men
themselves
an
injustice
for
the
men
whom
he
sees
are
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
even
though
muscular
enough
to
stand
this
short
physical
effort
excitable
old
gentlemen
who
believe
that
they
can
decide
at
a
glance
whether
a
man
is
medically
fit
and
write
to
the
press
about
the
shirkers
they
think
they
have
detected
were
of
the
opinion
long
since
that
the
should
be
combed
out
certain
journals
made
a
great
feature
of
this
proposal
whatever
may
be
the
case
elsewhere
i
can
only
say
that
as
far
as
our
unit
was
concerned
it
had
already
months
before
the
newspaper
agitation
been
combed
out
five
times
and
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
at
the
period
when
i
enlisted
our
colonel
declined
to
look
at
any
recruit
who
was
not
either
over
age
or
had
been
rejected
for
active
service
the
unit
was
thus
made
up
even
then
of
elderly
men
and
of
crocks
this
was
before
the
start
of
the
derby
scheme
and
of
course
considerably
before
the
introduction
of
universal
service
perhaps
it
is
allowable
to
point
the
moral
against
the
shirker
armchair
patriots
aforesaid
that
no
small
proportion
of
our
unit
was
composed
of
recruits
who
instead
of
informing
the
world
at
large
that
they
wished
they
were
younger
and
by
gad
i
envy
the
lads
their
chance
to
do
in
the
country
cause
did
not
rest
until
they
had
found
an
opening
in
my
own
hut
there
were
two
recruits
over
sixty
years
of
age
elsewhere
in
the
unit
there
were
several
over
fifty
our
at
meal
times
was
and
still
is
dotted
with
heads
not
of
retired
army
men
rejoined
but
of
men
who
previous
to
the
war
had
lived
comfortable
civilian
lives
at
a
later
date
when
the
few
fit
men
that
our
revealed
had
gone
elsewhere
the
unit
was
kept
up
to
strength
by
the
either
of
recruits
or
of
soldiers
who
having
been
at
the
front
and
been
wounded
or
invalided
back
were
marked
for
home
duty
only
so
much
for
the
slackers
in
khaki
which
one
extra
emphatic
writer
himself
not
in
khaki
although
younger
than
several
of
the
orderlies
here
professed
to
discover
in
the
those
slackers
may
be
having
an
easier
time
of
it
than
the
heroes
of
france
gallipoli
salonika
egypt
and
mesopotamia
but
they
are
not
having
so
easy
a
time
as
some
of
their
detractors
the
hospital
orderly
is
not
i
think
i
may
assert
on
his
behalf
puffed
up
with
foolish
illusions
as
to
his
place
in
the
scheme
of
things
it
is
a
humble
place
and
he
knows
it
his
work
is
almost
comically
unromantic
painfully
unpicturesque
moreover
let
us
be
frank
much
of
it
is
uninteresting
after
the
first
novelty
has
worn
off
work
in
the
wards
has
its
compensations
here
there
is
the
human
element
but
only
a
portion
of
a
unit
such
as
ours
can
be
detailed
for
ward
work
the
rest
are
either
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
or
else
have
their
noses
to
a
grindstone
of
clerical
monotonousness
beside
which
the
of
a
bank
employee
is
a
heaven
of
blissful
excitements
you
will
find
few
hospital
orderlies
who
are
not
fed
up
you
will
find
none
who
do
not
long
for
the
war
end
and
i
fancy
you
will
find
very
very
few
who
would
not
go
on
active
service
if
they
could
on
the
occasions
when
we
have
had
calls
for
overseas
volunteers
the
response
has
always
exceeded
the
demand
the
people
who
looking
at
a
party
of
hospital
orderlies
remark
it
sounds
incredible
but
there
people
who
make
the
remark
these
fellows
should
be
out
at
the
front
may
further
be
reminded
that
these
fellows
now
have
no
say
in
the
choice
of
their
own
whereabouts
not
a
soldier
in
the
land
can
decide
where
or
how
he
shall
serve
that
small
matter
is
not
for
him
but
for
the
authorities
he
may
be
thirsting
for
the
gore
of
brother
boche
and
an
inexorable
fate
condemns
him
to
scrub
the
gore
of
brother
briton
off
the
tiles
of
the
operating
theatre
he
may
but
i
never
met
one
who
did
elect
to
sit
snugly
on
a
stool
at
a
desk
army
forms
or
conducting
a
card
index
and
lo
at
a
whisper
from
some
unseen
nabob
in
the
war
office
he
finds
himself
hooked
off
his
stool
and
dumped
into
the
rifle
brigade
this
is
what
it
means
to
be
in
khaki
and
it
is
hardly
the
place
of
persons
not
in
khaki
to
bandy
sneers
about
the
comfortableness
of
the
linseed
lancers
whose
initials
when
not
standing
for
rob
all
my
comrades
can
be
interpreted
to
mean
run
away
coming
the
squad
of
orderlies
unloading
that
procession
of
ambulances
at
the
hospital
door
may
not
envy
the
wounded
sufferers
whom
they
transmit
to
their
wards
but
the
observer
is
mistaken
if
he
assumes
that
the
orderlies
have
by
some
questionable
manoeuvre
dodged
the
fiery
ordeal
of
which
this
string
of
stretchers
is
the
harvest
xi
the
recreation
rooms
we
rather
pride
ourselves
at
the
london
on
the
fame
of
our
hospital
not
merely
as
a
place
in
which
the
wounded
get
well
but
as
a
place
in
which
they
also
have
a
good
time
the
two
things
truth
to
tell
are
interlinked
a
truism
which
might
seem
to
need
no
labouring
were
it
not
for
the
evidence
brought
from
more
rigid
and
establishments
a
couple
of
our
most
valued
departments
are
the
old
rec
and
the
new
rec
the
old
and
new
recreation
rooms
the
new
recreation
room
a
spacious
and
hut
contains
three
billiard
tables
a
library
and
current
newspapers
british
and
colonial
this
room
is
the
scene
of
billiard
and
pool
tournaments
and
other
sociable
ongoings
sometimes
there
is
an
exhibition
match
on
the
best
billiard
table
the
local
champion
of
wandsworth
shows
us
his
skill
and
a
very
pretty
touch
he
has
once
the
lady
billiard
champion
of
england
came
and
defeated
the
best
opponent
we
could
enlist
against
her
an
event
which
provoked
tremendous
applause
from
a
packed
congregation
of
boys
in
blue
the
old
recreation
room
is
fitted
with
a
permanent
stage
for
theatricals
and
concerts
it
is
also
our
movie
palace
i
think
our
hospital
was
the
first
to
instal
a
cinematograph
as
a
fixture
during
the
morning
the
floor
area
is
dotted
with
miniature
billiard
tables
which
are
never
for
a
moment
out
of
use
in
the
afternoon
these
are
removed
some
hundreds
of
chairs
replace
them
and
at
we
begin
an
entertainment
music
a
play
we
have
had
shakespeare
here
lantern
slides
films
or
what
not
those
entertainments
which
have
continued
unbrokenly
since
the
hospital
began
to
function
in
constitute
the
outstanding
feature
of
the
good
time
enjoyed
by
londoners
the
old
rec
and
its
crowded
concerts
will
be
a
memory
cherished
by
hosts
of
fighting
men
from
the
homeland
and
from
overseas
in
the
original
hospital
plan
drawn
up
before
the
war
the
old
rec
which
is
a
part
of
the
main
school
building
was
marked
down
to
be
a
ward
of
forty
beds
its
structure
its
internal
geography
and
the
sheer
impossibility
of
providing
it
with
the
essential
sanitary
conveniences
would
make
it
unsuitable
to
be
a
ward
of
four
beds
let
alone
of
forty
on
this
account
its
allotment
for
recreation
purposes
would
be
excusable
but
the
old
rec
and
the
new
rec
too
for
that
matter
justify
their
superficial
waste
of
on
other
and
unanswerable
grounds
it
is
a
mere
matter
of
common
sense
to
arrange
some
centre
to
which
the
patient
can
repair
and
employ
his
leisure
when
he
is
sufficiently
well
to
potter
about
though
not
well
enough
to
be
discharged
from
hospital
instead
of
idling
in
his
ward
and
disturbing
the
patients
who
are
still
confined
to
bed
and
who
often
are
urgently
in
need
of
quietness
the
convalescent
departs
to
one
or
other
of
the
recreation
rooms
morning
and
afternoon
where
he
can
make
as
much
noise
as
he
likes
and
where
he
can
meet
and
fraternise
with
his
comrades
from
every
front
what
exchanging
of
stories
those
recreation
rooms
have
witnessed
on
the
one
hand
then
the
seriously
ill
patient
is
not
annoyed
by
the
rovings
in
the
ward
of
the
walking
patients
and
on
the
other
the
walking
patients
are
not
irked
by
the
necessity
for
keeping
quiet
at
a
period
when
returning
health
stimulates
them
to
a
wholesome
desire
for
fun
both
kinds
of
patients
thus
may
legitimately
be
said
to
get
better
more
quickly
than
they
would
have
had
a
chance
to
do
were
it
not
for
the
recreation
rooms
it
is
within
the
writer
knowledge
that
the
medical
staff
of
the
hospital
on
being
consulted
as
to
the
bed
value
of
the
recreation
rooms
unanimously
agreed
that
their
existence
reduced
the
average
sojourn
of
the
hospital
inmates
by
a
definite
per
day
ratio
that
ratio
so
far
from
showing
a
waste
worked
out
at
a
gain
of
equivalent
to
a
ward
if
such
a
colossal
ward
could
conceived
of
upwards
of
beds
so
much
for
a
point
which
might
not
appear
to
be
worth
detailed
explanation
but
which
has
here
been
glanced
at
in
order
that
critics
for
unbelievable
though
it
sounds
there
have
been
curmudgeons
to
growl
of
spoiling
the
wounded
by
too
much
pleasure
may
be
answered
in
advance
the
recreation
rooms
are
a
paying
investment
both
to
the
hospital
and
to
the
state
this
is
our
trump
card
in
any
spoiling
the
wounded
controversy
though
i
dare
say
that
most
of
us
would
not
in
any
case
care
twopence
whether
the
concerts
and
films
and
billiards
were
an
investment
or
an
extravagance
nothing
would
stand
in
the
way
of
our
ambition
to
provide
the
now
proverbial
good
time
for
all
the
guests
of
the
london
scores
of
concerts
of
an
excellence
which
would
have
been
noteworthy
anywhere
have
been
presented
to
our
assemblages
of
wounded
in
the
old
rec
singers
musicians
actors
and
actresses
have
come
and
given
of
their
best
miss
hullah
music
in
war
time
committee
that
delightful
body
and
howard
williams
parties
are
perhaps
our
greatest
regular
standbys
certain
sections
of
the
public
know
howard
williams
name
as
a
famous
one
in
other
fields
of
activity
to
thousands
of
soldiers
it
is
honoured
as
that
of
the
man
who
tirelessly
organised
scrumptious
pierrot
shows
exhibition
boxing
contests
nigger
troupe
entertainments
a
list
of
jollifications
indoors
in
winter
and
in
the
open
air
in
summer
infinite
in
variety
and
guaranteed
never
once
to
fall
flat
a
curious
empire
reputation
this
of
williams
yesterday
for
instance
a
nigger
troupe
visited
the
hospital
to
be
exact
they
were
the
metropolitan
police
minstrels
by
permission
of
sir
henry
commissioner
but
no
member
of
the
audience
i
imagine
could
picture
those
jocose
blackamoors
with
their
tambourines
and
bones
as
really
being
anything
so
serious
as
constables
that
their
comic
songs
were
accompanied
by
a
faultless
orchestra
was
understandable
enough
one
can
believe
in
a
police
band
one
is
not
surprised
that
the
police
band
is
a
good
band
to
believe
that
the
person
with
the
huge
red
mouth
who
sings
under
the
archway
archibald
and
follows
this
amorous
ditty
with
a
clog
dance
is
in
his
washed
moments
the
terror
of
burglars
requires
unthinkable
flights
of
imagination
as
i
gazed
at
this
singular
resurrection
of
moore
and
burgess
and
breathless
childhood
afternoons
at
the
hall
the
half
circle
of
inanely
alert
faces
the
colour
of
fresh
polished
boots
the
preposterous
uniforms
and
expansive
the
nigger
dialect
which
this
strange
convention
demands
but
which
can
not
be
said
to
resemble
the
speech
of
any
african
tribe
yet
discovered
i
found
that
by
no
effort
of
faith
or
credulity
could
i
pierce
the
disguise
and
perceive
policemen
it
is
at
least
twenty
years
since
i
met
a
nigger
minstrel
in
the
flesh
vague
ghosts
of
bygone
persons
and
of
piquant
anachronisms
seemed
to
float
approvingly
in
the
air
the
prince
consort
bustles
the
high
bicycle
sherry
moody
and
sankey
the
crystal
palace
labouchere
pigs
in
clover
lottie
collins
evolution
bimetallism
hosts
of
forgotten
images
names
and
shibboleths
came
popping
out
from
the
brain
dusty
magically
released
by
the
spectacle
of
the
nigger
troupe
yes
i
was
indeed
switched
into
the
past
by
bones
massa
and
the
rest
and
yet
the
present
might
have
seemed
more
emphatic
and
more
poignant
one
felt
rather
than
saw
an
audience
of
several
hundred
persons
in
the
dim
rows
of
chairs
and
laughing
at
the
broad
witticisms
of
the
niggers
or
enjoying
their
choruses
and
orchestral
accompaniments
one
forgot
just
what
that
audience
consisted
of
what
it
meant
and
how
it
came
to
be
here
assembled
of
course
when
the
lights
were
turned
up
in
the
interval
one
beheld
the
usual
spectacle

an

a

it
was
a
family
gathering
i
descried
no
strangers
and
no
one
not
in
uniform
unless
you
count
the
men
too
ill
to
don
their
blue
slops
these
had
been
brought
in

wrapped
in

no

haphazard
audience
this
of
anybody

everybody
who
chooses
to

a
turnstile
entrance
to
this

is
free

the

is

continued
to
arrive
and
stow
themselves
discreetly
in
corners
by
some
strange
providence
each
orderly
had
found
that
for
a
while
he
could
be
spared
from
ward
or
office
sergeants
corporals
mysteriously
they
made
time
to
leave
their
various
departments
even
a
bevy
of
masseuses
those
experts
eternally
on
the
rush
from
ward
to
ward
had
peeped
in
to
see
the
nigger
minstrels
and
everybody
was
pleased
every
jest
and
every
conundrum
got
its
laugh
every
ballad
its
applause
not
that
we
ever
give
the
bird
to
those
who
come
to
amuse
us
offer
us
skill
in
any
shape
or
form
pierrots
niggers
pianist
violinist
conjurer
ventriloquist
dancer
reciter
any
or
all
of
these
will
be
appreciated
warmly
yesterday
for
the
nigger
minstrels
there
were
no
empty
chairs
until
in
the
midst
of
part
ii
a
laughable
sketch
the
programme
wherein
female
rôles
were
doubly
coy
by
reason
of
the
masculinity
of
their
falsetto
dialogue
and
remarkable
ankles
a
messenger
stole
hither
and
thither
whispering
to
the
orderlies
who
promptly
tiptoed
from
the
room
a
convoy
of
new
arrivals
demanded
our
presence
the
silent
ambulances
were
gliding
up
to
the
entrance
of
the
hospital
orderlies
fetched
from
their
jobs
and
from
the
entertainment
lined
up
in
the
rain
to
take
their
places
in
the
quartettes
of
bearers
who
lifted
out
the
stretchers
the
assistant
matron
standing
in
the
shelter
of
the
door
checked
her
list
the
medical
officer
handed
out
the
ward
tickets
the
lady
clerks
from
the
admission
and
discharge
office
took
the
patients
particulars
and
the
bathroom
became
very
busy
as
i
started
to
wheel
a
warrior
to
his
ward
the
door
opened
and
a
burst
of
emerged
on
his
astonished
ears
i
was
a
little
doubtful
as
to
whether
our
new
guest
would
not
think
his
reception
somewhat
flippant
in
key
the
poor
fellow
was
visibly
suffering
and
the
sound
of
tambourines
and
comedians
guffaws
seemed
a
scarcely
proper
comment
on
his
condition
i
might
have
spared
myself
these
misgivings
say
chum
he
interrogated
me
feebly
what
that
noise
nigger
minstrels
old
man
golly
and
have
i
got
to
go
straight
to
my
bed
alas
he
had
to
it
would
be
long
before
he
could
be
well
enough
to
be
taken
to
one
of
our
entertainments
but
had
he
been
given
his
way
he
would
have
gone
direct
from
his
fatiguing
overseas
journey
into
the
old
rec
to
join
the
family
party
and
chuckle
at
bones
and
massa
no
doubts
assailed
mind
as
to
whether
it
was
right
to
waste
on
mere
frivolities
a
nigger
minstrel
show
was
to
him
a
deal
more
important
in
fact
than
his
wound
and
perhaps
in
instinct
he
was
not
far
wrong
xii
the
cockney
before
i
enlisted
i
was
lodging
in
a
house
which
it
was
occasionally
convenient
to
approach
by
a
short
cut
through
an
area
of
slumland
one
night
when
traversing
this
slum
the
hour
was
i
was
stopped
by
a
couple
of
women
who
told
me
that
there
was
a
man
lying
on
the
ground
in
an
adjacent
alley
they
thought
he
must
be
ill
would
i
come
and
look
at
him
they
led
me
down
a
turning
which
opened
into
a
narrow
court
this
court
was
reached
by
an
arched
tunnel
through
tenement
houses
the
tunnel
was
pitchy
black
but
i
struck
matches
as
i
proceeded
and
presently
we
came
upon
the
object
of
my
companions
solicitude
a
young
soldier
propped
against
the
wall
and
with
his
legs
projecting
across
the
flagstones
the
women
had
in
fact
discovered
him
by
tripping
over
those
legs
in
the
darkness
they
were
slatternly
women
but
and
when
i
had
managed
to
arouse
the
gentleman
in
khaki
and
hoist
him
to
his
feet
for
the
cause
of
his
indisposition
was
plain
and
he
had
slept
it
off
they
called
down
blessings
on
my
head
and
overwhelmed
our
friend
with
sympathy
which
he
did
not
wholly
deserve
and
to
which
he
made
no
rejoinder
nor
did
he
vouchsafe
any
very
lucid
answer
when
i
asked
him
whither
he
was
bound
i
was
prepared
to
pilot
him
but
i
could
hardly
do
so
without
knowing
towards
which
point
of
the
compass
he
proposed
to
steer
or
rather
to
be
steered
i
know
i
wanter
go
was
all
i
could
get
out
of
him
very
well
if
he
knew
his
address
it
was
no
concern
of
mine
he
could
lead
on
i
would
act
as
a
mere
supporter
in
this
capacity
with
my
arm
linked
firmly
in
his
i
brought
him
forth
from
the
tunnel
to
the
street
he
had
no
wish
it
seemed
to
go
through
the
tunnel
into
the
court
and
here
we
bade
farewell
to
the
ladies
which
way
now
i
inquired
my
charge
responded
not
but
crossed
to
a
corner
and
meandered
up
one
of
those
interminable
thoroughfares
which
lead
out
of
london
into
the
suburbs
trudging
with
him
and
helping
him
to
sustain
his
balance
which
was
not
as
stable
as
could
be
wished
i
plied
him
with
mildly
genial
conversation
and
at
last
elicited
a
few
vague
answers
these
were
couched
in
the
cockney
idiom
but
i
caught
a
faint
nasal
twang
which
led
me
to
suspect
that
the
speaker
had
come
from
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
yes
he
told
me
he
had
just
arrived
from
canada
we
had
proceeded
a
short
distance
when
on
the
further
side
of
the
street
i
descried
a
golden
halo
which
outlined
the
silhouette
of
a
coffee
stall
it
occurred
to
me
that
a
cup
of
hot
coffee
would
be
a
good
tonic
to
disperse
the
last
symptoms
of
my
friend
indiscretion
so
i
deflected
him
across
the
road
and
we
brought
up
together
alongside
the
counter
lest
the
reader
should
be
unacquainted
with
that
unique
creation
the
i
must
explain
that
it
is
nocturnal
in
habit
emerging
from
its
lair
only
between
the
hours
of
and
it
is
an
equipage
of
which
the
interior
is
inhabited
by
a
fat
jolly
man
at
least
according
to
my
experience
he
is
always
fat
and
jolly
surrounded
by
steaming
urns
plates
of
cake
buns
of
a
hue
pale
pastries
ham
sandwiches
and
packets
of
cigarettes
the
upper
panels
of
one
of
its
sides
unfold
to
form
a
bar
below
and
a
penthouse
roof
above
the
latter
being
generally
extended
into
an
awning
the
awning
is
a
protection
for
the
customer
not
against
the
sun
a
luminary
from
whose
assaults
the
london
have
little
to
fear
but
against
the
rain
thanks
to
these
awnings
and
the
chattiness
of
the
fat
jolly
man
and
the
warmth
exhaled
by
the
urns
and
the
circumstance
that
the
public
houses
are
shut
our
are
able
to
sell
two
brownish
beverages
called
respectively
coffee
and
tea
which
otherwise
could
hardly
hope
to
achieve
the
honour
of
human
consumption
fate
has
guided
me
on
many
midnight
pilgrimages
through
the
town
and
i
have
imbibed
sometimes
with
relish
the
liquids
alluded
to
i
have
also
partaken
of
the
pallid
pastry
and
the
buns
i
am
therefore
in
a
position
to
write
for
the
benefit
of
persons
less
well
informed
a
treatise
on
this
i
shall
refrain
from
doing
the
one
point
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
mention
is
that
the
fat
jolly
man
being
deplorably
distrustful
does
not
supply
casual
customers
with
teaspoons
you
may
have
a
cup
of
alleged
tea
one
penny
or
a
cup
of
alleged
coffee
one
penny
a
dollop
of
sugar
is
dropped
into
the
cup
the
fat
jolly
man
gives
the
mixture
a
with
a
teaspoon
then
he
places
the
cup
before
you
on
the
bar
but
the
teaspoon
is
still
in
his
grasp
i
dare
say
he
would
lend
you
the
teaspoon
if
you
requested
him
to
do
so
but
unless
you
have
that
audacity
he
prefers
to
keep
the
teaspoon
on
his
side
of
the
bar
out
of
harm
way
this
may
seem
strange
when
you
perceive
that
the
teaspoon
is
fashioned
of
a
metal
unknown
to
silversmiths
and
might
be
priced
at
threepence
but
even
a
threepenny
teaspoon
is
a
souvenir
which
some
collectors
would
not
despise
presumably
regular
customers
receive
teaspoons
for
teaspoons
lie
in
a
heap
on
the
fat
jolly
man
side
of
the
counter
this
was
the
case
at
the
before
which
the
young
soldier
and
i
ranged
ourselves
and
the
heap
of
teaspoons
seemed
to
exercise
a
curious
fascination
upon
the
soldier
he
continued
to
stare
at
them
for
some
minutes
after
i
had
set
in
front
of
him
his
cup
of
coffee
then
he
stared
at
the
fat
jolly
man
who
was
cutting
slabs
from
a
loaf
he
stared
for
a
long
time
making
no
reply
to
my
remarks
rain
began
to
patter
on
the
awning
it
had
rained
earlier
in
the
night
and
i
became
aware
of
a
figure
lurking
in
the
background
on
the
pavement
beyond
the
awning
shelter
but
within
the
radius
of
the
haze
of
light
projected
therefrom
it
was
a
wretched
slinking
figure
that
of
an
elderly
man
with
bleared
eyes
and
a
red
nose
one
of
those
pariahs
who
haunt
cabstands
and
promote
the
cabs
up
the
rank
when
the
front
vehicle
is
hailed
this
special
specimen
of
his
breed
appeared
to
be
a
satellite
of
the
proprietor
perhaps
he
helped
to
tow
the
stall
to
its
berth
whatever
might
be
his
function
he
lingered
on
the
outskirts
of
the
ring
of
light
watching
us
and
the
young
soldier
in
his
slow
scrutiny
of
the
stall
and
its
surroundings
caught
sight
of
him
and
stared
stolidly
as
he
had
stared
at
everything
else
i
was
in
the
act
of
drinking
my
coffee
when
the
soldier
suddenly
leant
across
the
counter
picked
up
a
spoon
turned
and
threw
it
at
the
derelict
whose
face
wavered
on
the
edge
of
the
lamplight
circle
the
victim
of
this
extraordinary
attack
dodged
the
missile
then
grovelled
after
it
in
the
gutter
meanwhile
the
fat
man
instantaneously
ceasing
to
be
jolly
gave
vent
to
an
angry
protest
wotcher
do
for
chuckin
my
spoons
abart
drunk
that
wot
you
are
ai
drunk
said
the
soldier
wotcher
chuck
my
spoon
at
for
then
ai
done
you
no
yus
was
the
soldier
surprising
retort
no
ai
yus
no
ai
done
you
no
to
which
the
derelict
chimed
in
he
had
retrieved
the
spoon
and
now
advanced
timidly
with
it
under
the
awning
i
ai
done
no
a
husky
whimpering
chorus
to
his
fat
patron
the
soldier
fixed
the
derelict
with
a
fierce
glare
yus
you
he
reiterated
i
was
wondering
how
the
dispute
might
develop
but
evidently
my
ear
is
unattuned
to
the
nuances
of
these
dialectics
the
soldier
glare
and
the
soldier
tone
must
have
betrayed
themselves
to
the
two
other
men
as
factitious
the
derelict
anyhow
lost
his
nervousness
and
approaching
nearer
scanned
the
soldier
with
dim
peering
eyes
then
broke
into
a
joyous
grin
and
exclaimed
lumme
if
it
ai
ol
bert
and
the
fat
man
leaning
on
his
counter
and
likewise
examining
the
soldier
cried
ol
bert
it
is
knew
you
in
two
ticks
grunted
bert
same
ol
this
was
the
derelict
same
ol
this
was
the
fat
and
once
again
jolly
man
explanations
ensued
bert
the
young
soldier
was
a
native
of
these
parts
he
had
emigrated
to
canada
five
years
previously
for
the
front
he
had
returned
earlier
in
the
evening
there
had
been
libations
he
had
started
for
his
home
felt
sleepy
sheltered
from
the
wet
in
a
tunnel
quite
familiar
to
him
and
there
been
discovered
by
the
ladies
and
roused
by
myself
arrived
at
the
he
had
recognised
in
its
proprietor
a
former
pal
and
another
former
pal
in
the
derelict
to
throw
the
spoon
at
was
merely
his
playful
mode
of
announcing
his
identity
i
left
the
trio
reviewing
the
past
and
exchanging
news
of
the
present
my
services
it
was
clear
would
no
longer
be
required
by
the
prodigal
he
and
his
mates
gave
me
a
hearty
i
did
not
guess
how
intimate
was
soon
to
be
my
association
with
the
berts
and
and
of
the
world
i
was
to
be
their
servant
to
wait
upon
them
to
perform
menial
tasks
for
them
to
wash
them
and
dress
them
and
undress
them
to
carry
them
in
my
arms
i
was
to
see
them
suffer
and
to
learn
to
respect
their
gameness
and
the
wry
grousing
humour
which
is
their
almost
universal
trait
in
my
own
wards
and
elsewhere
in
the
hospital
i
came
in
close
contact
with
many
cockneys
of
the
slums
even
when
one
had
not
precisely
placed
a
patient
of
this
description
the
relatives
who
came
to
him
on
visiting
days
gave
the
clue
to
the
stock
from
which
he
sprang
the
mother
was
sometimes
a
flower
girl
the
sweetheart
with
a
very
feathered
hat
and
hair
which
evidently
lived
in
curling
pins
except
on
great
occasions
probably
worked
in
a
factory
these
people
if
the
patient
were
confined
to
bed
sat
beside
him
and
talked
in
a
subdued
throaty
whisper
but
i
have
seen
the
same
sort
of
patient
well
enough
to
walk
about
meet
his
folks
on
visiting
afternoons
at
the
hospital
gate
there
is
a
crowd
at
the
hospital
gate
passing
in
and
going
out
hosts
of
patients
are
waiting
some
in
wheeled
chairs
and
some
seated
on
the
iron
fence
which
fringes
the
drive
the
reunions
which
occur
at
that
gate
are
exceedingly
public
our
east
ender
is
perhaps
accustomed
to
publicity
his
slum
does
not
conceal
its
feelings
it
quarrels
and
makes
love
without
drawn
blinds
and
privacy
is
not
an
essential
of
its
ardours
be
that
as
it
may
these
meetings
at
the
hospital
gate
which
are
not
lacking
in
pathos
have
sometimes
manifested
a
comicality
when
the
actors
in
the
drama
belonged
to
the
class
which
produced
bert
in
a
higher
class
there
is
restraint
and
a
rather
stupid
bashfulness
i
have
seen
a
wounded
youngster
flush
apprehensively
and
only
peck
his
mother
in
return
for
her
sobbing
embrace
that
is
not
bert
way
he
knows
he
is
not
a
fool
that
his
mother
looks
a
trifle
absurd
as
with
bonnet
awry
she
surges
perspiringly
past
the
sentries
the
tails
of
her
skirt
dragging
in
the
dust
and
her
feet
flattened
with
the
weight
of
unwholesome
obesity
they
have
to
bear
but
he
hobbles
sprily
to
meet
her
and
his
salute
is
no
mere
peck
but
a
smacking
kiss
so
noisy
that
it
makes
everyone
laugh
he
laughs
too
perhaps
he
did
it
on
purpose
to
raise
a
laugh
that
is
his
quaint
method
but
the
fact
remains
that
whatever
his
motive
he
has
managed
to
please
his
mother
she
is
sniffing
loudly
yet
laughing
also
and
one
could
want
no
better
picture
of
human
affection
than
this
of
bermondsey
bert
and
his
shapeless
maybe
mother
exchanging
that
resounding
and
ungraceful
kiss
at
the
hospital
gate
i
have
heard
bert
shout
mother
from
a
hundred
yards
off
when
he
spied
her
coming
through
the
gate
no
false
shame
there
no
smug
good
form
in
that
nor
in
the
jest
which
follows
and
you
remembered
to
bring
me
a
bottle
of
beer
mother
of
course
visitors
are
not
allowed
to
introduce
alcohol
into
the
hospital
otherwise
i
am
afraid
there
is
no
doubt
that
mother
would
have
obliged
in
one
of
our
wards
we
harboured
for
a
while
a
costermonger
this
coster
an
entertaining
and
plucky
creature
who
had
to
have
a
leg
amputated
received
no
callers
on
visiting
day
his
own
relatives
were
dead
and
he
and
his
wife
had
separated
could
it
orf
he
explained
and
with
laudable
impartiality
added
married
beneath
she
did
she
married
me
as
the
lady
was
herself
a
coster
it
was
plain
that
here
as
in
other
grades
of
society
there
are
degrees
conventions
and
barriers
which
may
not
be
lightly
overstepped
sister
however
thought
that
the
patient
should
inform
his
wife
that
he
had
lost
his
leg
and
prevailed
on
him
to
send
her
a
letter
to
that
effect
a
few
days
later
he
was
asked
well
did
you
write
and
tell
your
wife
you
had
lost
a
leg
yus
i
suppose
she
answered
what
has
she
said
said
a
liar
her
retort
had
neither
disconcerted
nor
offended
him
he
was
a
philosopher
and
like
so
many
of
his
kind
a
laughing
philosopher
when
he
was
sufficiently
recovered
from
his
operation
to
get
about
on
crutches
he
was
the
wag
of
the
ward
he
took
a
special
delight
in
those
practical
jokes
which
are
invented
by
patients
to
tease
the
nurses
and
devoted
the
most
painstaking
ingenuity
to
their
preparation
it
was
he
who
found
a
small
hole
in
the
wall
which
separates
the
ward
from
the
ward
kitchen
through
this
hole
a
length
of
cotton
was
passed
and
tied
to
the
handle
of
a
mug
on
the
kitchen
shelf
at
this
period
owing
to
the
zeppelin
raids
only
the
barest
minimum
of
light
was
allowed
and
the
night
nurse
when
she
entered
the
kitchen
went
into
almost
complete
darkness
no
sooner
was
she
in
the
kitchen
and
fumbling
for
what
she
required
than
a
faint
noise
that
of
the
cup
being
twitched
by
the
cotton
leading
to
the
mischievous
coster
bed
arose
on
the
shelf
and
convinced
her
that
she
was
in
the
presence
of
a
mouse
she
retreated
and
perhaps
if
any
convalescent
patient
had
been
awake
she
would
have
enlisted
his
aid
to
expel
the
mouse
but
in
the
ward
the
patients
were
as
one
man
snoring
vociferously
it
was
this
slightly
overdone
snoring
at
the
finish
which
gave
birth
to
suspicions
and
caused
the
trick
to
be
detected
the
night
nurses
do
not
have
a
placid
time
of
it
if
their
patients
are
at
the
stage
of
recovery
when
spirits
begin
to
rise
and
the
early
which
the
hospital
rules
prescribe
is
not
welcome
knaveries
more
or
less
similar
to
the
one
are
always
devised
for
the
plaguing
of
a
new
night
nurse
sometimes
in
the
dead
of
night
when
utter
silence
broods
over
the
ward
the
gramophone
will
abruptly
burst
into
raucous
music
its
mechanism
has
been
released
by
a
contrivance
which
gives
no
clue
to
the
crime
perpetrator
the
flustered
nurse
gropes
her
way
down
the
ward
and
stops
the
gramophone
every
patient
meanwhile
sitting
up
in
bed
and
protesting
against
her
cruelty
in
having
awakened
them
by
starting
it
half
an
hour
after
the
ward
has
quietened
the
other
gramophone
some
wards
own
two
whirrs
off
into
impudent
song
it
also
has
been
primed
nurse
is
wiser
on
future
occasions
she
stows
the
gramophones
when
she
comes
on
duty
where
no
one
can
tamper
with
them
even
so
she
may
have
her
nerves
preyed
upon
by
eerie
tinklings
impossible
to
locate
in
the
darkness
these
are
caused
by
two
knives
hung
from
a
nail
fixed
high
up
in
the
rafters
by
jiggling
a
string
which
is
conducted
over
another
rafter
and
down
the
wall
to
his
pillow
the
patient
makes
the
knifeblades
clash
sometimes
two
strings
leading
to
different
beds
complete
this
instrument
of
torture
after
a
determined
search
nurse
finds
one
string
and
having
cut
it
flatters
herself
that
she
has
got
the
better
of
her
enemies
not
a
bit
of
it
she
has
scarcely
settled
in
her
chair
again
before
the
tinklings
recommence
the
second
string
is
in
action
and
as
she
hunts
about
the
ward
for
the
source
of
the
melody
in
the
ceiling
muffled
convulsions
of
mirth
from
the
dim
rows
of
beds
furnish
evidence
that
her
naughty
charges
are
not
getting
the
repose
which
they
require
and
to
ensure
which
is
part
of
the
purpose
of
her
presence
a
nurse
who
happens
to
be
unpopular
never
has
these
pranks
played
upon
her
they
are
in
the
nature
of
a
compliment
nor
do
they
occur
in
a
ward
where
there
is
a
patient
seriously
ill
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
patients
acting
inconsiderately
towards
a
distressed
comrade
this
observation
renders
all
the
more
amusing
the
scandalised
concern
which
i
once
beheld
on
the
demure
physiognomy
of
a
visiting
clergyman
when
he
gathered
the
drift
of
certain
allusions
to
a
case
on
the
danger
list
the
name
of
the
danger
list
explains
itself
when
a
patient
is
put
on
the
danger
list
his
relatives
are
sent
for
and
may
be
with
him
whether
it
is
the
visiting
afternoon
or
not
if
they
come
from
the
provinces
they
are
presented
with
a
railway
pass
and
if
poor
are
allotted
lodgings
near
the
hospital
a
grant
being
made
to
them
from
our
benevolent
fund
for
the
information
of
the
who
answer
visitors
questions
in
the
enquiry
bureau
at
the
main
entrance
to
the
hospital
a
copy
of
the
danger
list
hangs
there
and
it
is
on
record
that
an
awestruck
child
seeing
this
column
of
patients
names
and
reading
the
heading
asked
what
does
list
mean
does
it
mean
that
it
dangerous
to
go
near
them
now
in
ward
c
a
patient
a
cockney
was
on
the
danger
list
which
circumstance
availed
nothing
to
depress
his
spirits
in
spite
of
considerable
pain
he
poked
fun
at
the
prospect
of
his
own
imminent
demise
and
was
himself
the
chief
offender
against
the
edict
of
quietness
which
sister
had
issued
for
her
ward
he
talk
and
he
talk
about
undertakers
epitaphs
and
the
details
of
a
military
funeral
that
there
top
note
of
the
last
post
on
the
bugle
does
sound
proper
he
said
a
verdict
which
anyone
who
has
heard
this
beautiful
and
inspired
fanfare
which
is
the
farewell
above
a
soldier
grave
and
which
ends
on
a
soaring
treble
will
endorse
but
he
went
on
if
the
bugler
a
drop
o
somethin
warm
on
the
way
to
the
cemetery
that
there
top
note
always
reminds
me
of
a
an
if
over
me
i
shall
wanter
spit
in
eye
blimey
if
i
wo
this
persiflage
had
been
going
on
for
a
couple
of
days
and
getting
to
be
more
and
more
elaborate
and
allusive
infecting
the
entire
ward
so
that
the
fact
that
the
man
was
on
the
danger
list
had
become
a
kind
of
catchword
amongst
his
fellows
entered
in
all
innocence
the
clergyman
the
very
bloke
to
put
me
up
to
all
the
tricks
from
the
irreverent
one
at
the
same
moment
a
walking
patient
also
a
cockney
who
had
been
reading
a
newspaper
gave
vent
to
a
cry
of
feigned
horror
boys
he
announced
it
says
there
a
shortage
of
timber
guffaws
greeted
this
sally
everyone
saw
the
innuendo
at
once
everyone
except
the
clergyman
and
when
he
grasped
the
point
that
ol
chum
was
on
the
danger
list
and
a
shortage
of
timber
was
supposed
to
imply
that
he
might
be
done
out
of
a
coffin
he
was
visibly
shocked
perhaps
he
did
not
understand
cockney
humour
however
one
may
add
that
our
irrepressible
friend
at
the
moment
of
writing
is
off
the
danger
list
albeit
only
after
a
protracted
struggle
with
the
enemy
at
whom
he
jeered
and
is
now
contriving
to
be
as
funny
about
life
as
he
was
funny
and
fearless
about
death
i
caught
sight
of
another
cockney
acquaintance
of
mine
whose
christian
name
is
bill
trundling
himself
down
the
hospital
drive
in
a
wheeled
chair
perched
on
the
knee
of
his
one
leg
with
its
feet
planted
on
the
stump
which
is
all
that
is
left
of
the
other
was
his
child
aged
four
beside
him
walked
his
wife
resplendent
in
a
magenta
blouse
and
a
hat
with
green
and
pink
plumes
the
trio
looked
happy
and
bill
gala
attire
was
symbolical
when
bill
was
in
my
ward
he
too
was
on
the
danger
list
i
remember
that
when
he
first
came
to
us
before
his
operation
and
before
he
took
a
turn
for
the
worse
his
wife
visited
him
in
that
same
magenta
blouse
or
another
equally
startling
and
that
for
some
reason
she
and
sister
did
not
quite
hit
it
off
had
words
and
subsequently
for
a
period
were
not
on
speaking
terms
later
when
bill
underwent
his
operation
and
began
to
sink
his
bed
was
moved
out
on
to
the
ward
verandah
here
his
wife
now
wearing
a
subdued
blouse
sat
beside
him
hour
after
hour
while
little
bill
the
child
towed
a
cheap
wooden
engine
up
and
down
the
grass
patch
oblivious
to
the
ordeal
through
which
his
parents
were
passing
it
was
my
business
as
orderly
to
intrude
at
intervals
upon
the
scene
on
the
verandah
to
bring
bill
such
food
as
he
was
able
to
tolerate
on
the
first
occasion
after
bill
collapse
that
i
prepared
to
take
him
a
cup
of
tea
sister
stopped
me
do
forget
to
take
tea
and
some
bread
and
butter
to
that
poor
woman
she
looks
tired
and
some
milk
for
the
child
very
good
sister
i
cut
and
filled
an
extra
mug
of
tea
orderly
what
are
you
doing
sister
had
reappeared
and
i
was
rebuked
because
i
was
going
to
offer
bill
her
tea
in
a
tin
mug
the
patients
all
have
tin
mugs
and
had
cut
her
too
thick
i
must
cut
dainty
slices
of
thin
use
sister
own
china
ware
and
serve
the
whole
spread
on
a
tray
with
a
cloth
all
of
which
was
typical
of
sister
who
from
that
day
treated
bill
wife
with
true
tenderness
and
bill
wife
became
one
of
sister
most
enthusiastic
adorers
it
came
to
pass
after
a
week
of
pitiful
anxiety
that
the
medical
officer
pronounced
bill
safe
once
more
bloke
says
i
not
goin
ter
peg
art
he
told
me
i
congratulated
him
and
remarked
that
his
wife
would
be
thankful
when
he
met
her
on
her
arrival
with
such
splendid
news
i
the
larf
of
my
missus
said
bill
she
comes
i
shall
tell
i
some
serious
noos
for
and
she
ter
send
the
kid
darn
on
the
grarse
ter
play
then
i
pull
a
long
fice
and
hask
ter
bear
up
and
say
i
sorry
for
and
she
must
tike
it
too
rough
and
all
that
and
she
my
sympathy
in
diserpointment
ai
ter
get
widow
pension
arter
i
believe
that
this
programme
was
carried
through
more
or
less
to
the
letter
certain
it
is
that
i
myself
overheard
another
of
bill
grim
pleasantries
he
was
explaining
to
madame
that
they
must
apprentice
their
offspring
to
the
engineering
trade
i
wanter
mike
lil
bill
a
mowter
chap
so
can
oil
the
of
me
fancy
leg
wot
ter
get
at
roehampton
the
fancy
leg
ended
by
being
the
favourite
theme
of
bill
disgraceful
extravaganzas
he
would
announce
to
sister
when
she
was
dressing
his
stump
that
he
had
been
studying
means
of
earning
his
living
in
the
future
and
had
decided
to
become
a
professor
of
roller
skating
he
would
loudly
tell
his
wife
that
she
would
never
again
be
able
to
summons
him
for
assault
by
kicking
the
fancy
leg
would
not
give
the
real
one
sufficient
purchase
for
an
effective
kick
and
she
was
not
to
complain
in
future
about
his
cold
feet
against
her
back
in
bed
there
would
be
only
one
cold
foot
the
other
would
be
unhitched
and
on
the
floor
and
of
course
there
were
endless
jokes
about
what
had
been
done
with
the
amputated
leg
whether
it
had
got
a
tombstone
and
so
forth
some
of
the
suggestions
going
a
trifle
beyond
what
good
taste
in
more
fastidious
coteries
would
have
thought
permissible
but
bill
had
his
own
ideas
of
the
humorous
and
maybe
his
own
no
less
definite
ideas
of
dignity
in
this
latter
virtue
i
counted
the
fact
that
although
once
or
twice
when
he
was
very
low
he
gave
way
to
a
little
fretting
to
me
he
never
i
am
convinced
let
fall
one
querulous
word
in
the
presence
of
his
wife
she
sat
by
her
husband
side
and
when
things
were
at
their
worst
the
two
said
naught
the
wife
numbly
watched
her
bill
face
turning
now
and
then
to
glance
at
the
activities
of
little
bill
with
his
engine
or
to
smile
her
thanks
to
the
patients
who
sometimes
came
and
gave
the
child
pickaback
rides
when
i
intruded
i
knew
i
was
interrupting
the
communings
of
a
loving
and
happily
married
pair
and
the
slangings
of
each
other
which
signalised
bill
recovery
and
his
wife
relief
did
nothing
to
shake
my
certitude
that
like
many
slum
dwellers
they
owned
a
mutual
esteem
which
other
couples
of
superior
station
might
envy
personally
i
have
never
known
a
cockney
patient
who
did
not
evoke
affection
and
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
i
have
been
asking
a
number
of
sisters
whether
they
liked
to
have
cockneys
in
their
wards
without
a
single
exception
and
let
me
say
that
sisters
are
both
observant
and
critical
the
answers
have
been
enthusiastically
in
the
affirmative
xiii
the
station
party
an
earnest
shopman
not
long
ago
tried
to
sell
me
a
pair
of
for
use
as
he
explained
lest
their
name
should
have
misled
me
on
the
march
had
he
said
for
use
after
the
war
he
might
have
been
more
persuasive
when
i
told
him
that
were
no
good
to
me
it
was
manifestly
difficult
for
him
to
conceal
his
opinion
that
if
so
i
had
no
business
to
flaunt
the
garb
of
thomas
atkins
when
i
added
that
if
he
could
offer
me
a
pair
of
i
might
entertain
the
proposition
his
look
was
a
reproach
to
irreverent
facetiousness
a
grateful
country
has
presented
me
with
one
pair
of
excellent
but
a
hospital
ward
is
no
place
in
which
to
go
clumping
about
in
footgear
designed
to
stand
hard
wear
and
tear
on
the
and
my
army
boots
after
two
years
have
not
yet
needed
i
wore
them
it
is
true
during
my
period
of
service
with
the
chain
gang
as
a
squad
of
outdoor
orderlies
engaged
in
was
locally
called
and
i
wear
them
when
we
have
a
parade
an
occasion
on
which
naught
but
attire
is
allowable
it
would
take
a
century
of
parades
however
to
damage
boots
put
on
five
minutes
before
the
event
and
taken
off
five
minutes
after
the
parade
itself
necessitating
no
sturdier
pedestrianism
than
is
involved
in
walking
less
than
a
hundred
yards
to
the
ground
and
there
standing
at
attention
i
do
not
say
that
hospital
orderlies
never
go
for
a
march
only
that
marching
bulks
relatively
so
small
in
our
programme
that
any
special
equipment
for
the
purpose
sounds
a
little
ironical
the
issue
of
now
was
a
real
boon
not
that
all
the
pairs
with
which
our
unit
was
suddenly
flooded
by
the
authorities
proved
as
silent
as
they
were
intended
to
be
some
of
them
squeaked
and
the
peregrinations
of
the
orderly
thus
afflicted
were
perhaps
more
vexatious
to
the
ear
of
a
nervous
patient
at
night
than
even
the
clatter
of
honest
hobnails
and
the
soles
were
thin
a
pair
of
lasted
me
on
the
average
one
month
if
only
worn
within
the
ward
they
might
have
lasted
longer
though
not
so
very
much
longer
according
to
regulations
you
were
not
allowed
to
wear
except
within
the
confines
of
the
ward
no
doubt
it
was
expected
that
every
time
you
were
sent
on
an
errand
outside
the
ward
you
would
solemnly
take
off
your
and
put
on
your
then
on
the
return
take
off
your
and
put
on
your
but
life
as
a
nursing
orderly
is
too
short
for
such
elaborations
of
etiquette
it
was
nothing
unusual
when
one
was
working
in
a
ward
which
lay
at
a
distance
of
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
hospital
main
building
to
be
sent
to
the
said
main
building
a
dozen
times
in
a
single
morning
this
incessant
had
to
be
done
if
not
at
the
double
at
any
rate
at
nothing
slower
than
five
miles
per
hour
in
the
morning
the
busy
time
in
the
afternoon
a
speed
of
four
miles
per
hour
might
sometimes
be
permissible
at
all
events
as
i
told
the
shopman
would
not
have
been
inappropriate
during
certain
periods
of
crisis
from
time
to
time
our
tasks
were
interrupted
by
the
notes
of
a
bugle
or
the
shrilling
of
the
whistle
demanding
our
presence
for
an
intake
of
new
patients
a
party
of
orderlies
was
wanted
to
go
to
the
to
help
to
remove
from
the
ambulance
train
the
station
lies
at
a
distance
of
a
mile
from
the
hospital
and
this
small
pilgrimage
achieved
a
few
score
times
is
practically
all
i
know
of
the
veritable
employment
of
i
regretted
when
a
change
of
plans
diverted
the
ambulance
trains
to
the
central
termini
for
evacuation
the
interlude
of
a
trip
was
far
from
unwelcome
lined
up
on
the
parade
ground
we
were
put
in
charge
of
a
corporal
party
right
turn
quick
march
off
we
trudged
round
the
back
of
the
hospital
down
the
drive
out
past
the
sentry
and
away
along
the
road
presently
party
march
at
ease
cigarettes
were
lit
talking
was
allowed
and
someone
would
raise
a
tune
how
pleasant
it
is
to
march
to
singing
to
march
to
a
band
must
be
wonderful
or
a
brass
band
those
joys
will
never
be
mine
almost
all
the
marching
i
shall
have
done
in
the
great
war
will
be
summed
up
in
these
tiny
promenades
from
the
hospital
to
the
their
rhythm
sustained
by
choruses
none
too
melodious
occasionally
an
officer
would
be
descried
on
the
pavement
then
party
cigarettes
were
concealed
the
song
died
eyes
left
eyes
front
party
march
at
ease
the
cigarettes
reappeared
the
song
was
resumed
approaching
the
station
party
cigarettes
were
thrown
away
here
in
the
chief
street
we
must
make
a
smart
show
a
crowd
is
gathered
round
the
station
gate
attracted
by
the
array
of
red
cross
vehicles
within
police
are
keeping
back
the
curious
the
way
is
cleared
for
our
arrival
left
wheel
now
is
our
one
moment
of
glory
we
swing
round
through
the
lane
of
gaping
sightseers
and
in
style
across
the
station
yard
and
under
the
archway
flattering
ourselves
perhaps
not
without
justification
that
there
are
spectators
whose
eyes
pursue
us
with
secret
envy
at
the
serious
import
of
our
task
the
station
platform
when
we
reached
it
was
generally
a
blank
perspective
devoid
of
all
living
creatures
except
ourselves
fate
decreed
that
we
should
be
summoned
long
before
the
train
was
due
i
have
kicked
my
heels
for
many
a
doleful
hour
on
that
platform
and
the
reflection
that
they
also
serve
who
only
stand
and
wait
was
chilly
comfort
if
as
frequently
happened
we
had
been
hurried
off
dinnerless
the
convoys
arrivals
always
seemed
to
coincide
with
on
our
return
to
the
hospital
we
should
find
that
the
rations
had
been
kept
hot
for
us
but
in
the
meanwhile
an
empty
stomach
was
a
poor
preparation
for
the
strain
of
carrying
stretchers
up
the
stairs
from
the
station
platform
to
the
ambulances
and
those
of
us
who
could
produce
pennies
for
chocolate
gained
an
instant
popularity
the
longest
period
of
waiting
drew
to
an
end
at
last
however
the
platform
assumed
a
livelier
air
the
appeared
from
his
den
officers
of
the
army
medical
service
and
the
red
cross
strolled
down
and
the
stairs
and
platform
echoed
to
the
pattering
of
the
feet
of
hosts
of
industrious
bluebottles
fetching
stretchers
and
blankets
the
volunteers
who
form
a
portion
of
the
london
ambulance
column
are
nicknamed
the
bluebottles
in
allusion
to
their
dress
it
is
a
nickname
which
let
me
say
at
once
any
man
might
be
proud
of
i
know
not
whether
the
history
of
the
bluebottles
has
yet
been
written
but
certain
it
is
that
their
doings
have
got
into
newspaper
print
less
often
than
they
deserved
for
theirs
is
a
double
rôle
which
truly
merits
the
country
admiration
while
carrying
on
the
commerce
of
the
empire
that
vital
commerce
without
which
there
would
be
bankruptcy
and
no
sinews
of
war
nor
indeed
any
england
left
to
defend
they
have
vowed
themselves
also
of
their
own
to
the
helping
of
the
wounded
day
or
night
the
bluebottle
is
liable
to
be
called
from
his
desk
or
his
home
by
the
telephone
like
the
florentine
brother
of
the
misericordia
he
must
instantly
hurry
into
his
uniform
and
rush
to
the
place
appointed
he
may
be
busy
or
he
may
be
tired
no
matter
his
vow
holds
good
off
he
goes
to
the
to
meet
the
hospital
train
and
evacuate
its
stretchers
myself
i
have
the
deepest
respect
for
the
bluebottles
and
for
their
energy
in
a
cause
which
must
often
be
not
only
fatiguing
but
from
a
commercial
point
of
view
extremely
inconvenient
it
would
be
absurd
to
pretend
nevertheless
that
the
less
responsible
do
not
cherish
a
mild
contempt
for
all
bluebottles
there
is
no
reason
for
that
contempt
it
is
idiotic
childish
a
humiliating
exhibition
of
the
silliness
of
masculine
human
nature
members
of
our
who
had
enlisted
but
a
week
back
and
who
knew
nothing
whatever
of
their
work
would
in
a
whisper
mock
the
bluebottles
although
every
bluebottle
had
taken
classes
and
passed
examinations
at
which
most
of
the
mockers
would
have
boggled
the
bluebottles
were
civilians
there
you
have
it
we
who
would
probably
never
do
any
battlefield
soldiering
in
our
lives
looked
down
on
all
civilians
who
had
the
impudence
to
wear
a
uniform
of
any
sort
such
is
the
behaviour
of
the
sterner
sex
at
a
moment
when
its
sole
thought
should
be
of
sensible
and
efficient
in
the
performance
of
duty
for
of
course
it
was
our
duty
to
with
the
bluebottles
the
theory
with
which
we
beguiled
ourselves
that
the
bluebottles
were
physically
starvelings
and
required
our
herculean
aid
to
lift
the
stretchers
up
the
stairs
was
palpably
nonsense
still
we
told
ourselves
that
we
as
disciplined
soldiers
were
here
to
give
a
hand
to
a
civilian
mob
who
might
otherwise
faint
and
fail
a
singular
delusion
time
has
proved
its
falsity
for
with
the
issue
of
fresh
orders
our
ceased
to
function
the
bluebottles
now
make
shift
without
us
and
without
as
far
as
i
know
any
mishap
the
hospital
train
was
eventually
signalled
we
were
ranked
at
attention
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
the
bluebottles
stood
by
their
stretchers
there
was
hurrying
hither
and
thither
of
officials
sometimes
our
colonel
having
motored
from
the
hospital
appeared
on
the
platform
to
see
that
all
was
well
and
you
may
be
sure
that
we
endeavoured
to
look
alert
in
his
august
presence
and
finally
the
train
glided
into
the
station
the
hospital
trains
seemed
to
be
never
twice
the
same
south
westerns
north
westerns
great
northerns
midlands
great
centrals
lancashire
and
yorkshires
i
saw
them
all
at
one
time
or
another
their
sole
affinity
being
the
staring
red
crosses
painted
on
each
coach
a
coach
or
two
consisted
of
ordinary
compartments
for
cases
the
rest
were
vans
the
interiors
of
which
had
been
converted
into
wards
by
means
of
bunks
access
to
each
was
gained
by
a
wide
pair
of
sliding
doors
in
its
centre
these
doors
when
the
train
had
come
to
a
standstill
were
opened
by
orderlies
who
lowered
gangways
and
then
gazed
forth
at
us
while
they
awaited
orders
with
the
eyes
of
men
who
had
been
deprived
of
the
proper
allowance
of
sleep
as
soon
as
the
list
of
the
medical
officer
on
the
train
had
been
checked
with
that
of
the
medical
officer
on
the
platform
the
evacuation
began
were
sent
off
first
generally
a
tatterdemalion
crew
hobbling
and
shuffling
along
the
platform
and
at
one
stage
of
the
war
with
trench
mud
still
clinging
to
their
clothes
they
seldom
needed
our
assistance
the
bluebottles
even
if
feeble
folk
were
deemed
by
our
corporal
to
be
fit
to
give
any
weak
walking
patient
an
arm
or
carry
his
kit
the
walking
patients
in
fact
were
a
mere
episode
whirled
them
off
five
or
six
at
a
time
and
they
might
be
half
through
the
process
of
being
bathed
at
the
hospital
before
the
last
was
quit
of
the
train
the
stretcher
cases
were
our
concern
pairs
of
bluebottles
each
carrying
a
stretcher
entered
the
and
anon
reappeared
with
their
burden
now
came
our
cue
to
act
as
the
stretcher
approached
the
foot
of
the
stair
two
of
our
number
stepped
forth
from
the
rank
each
taking
a
handle
from
a
bluebottle
the
stretcher
thus
proceeded
on
its
course
up
the
stair
carried
by
four
men
one
on
each
handle
two
bluebottles
and
two
that
flight
of
iron
stairs
from
the
platform
to
the
road
seemed
no
very
arduous
ordeal
for
the
first
journeys
there
was
a
knack
about
keeping
the
stretcher
horizontal
the
front
bearers
must
hold
their
handles
as
low
as
possible
the
rear
bearers
must
hoist
their
handles
it
was
all
plain
sailing
and
perfectly
easy
four
men
to
a
stretcher
is
luxurious
at
least
it
is
luxurious
on
the
level
and
if
you
have
not
far
to
go
and
not
many
consecutive
stretchers
to
carry
but
when
the
convoy
was
a
large
one
when
the
bearers
were
too
few
and
you
had
no
sooner
got
rid
of
one
stretcher
than
you
must
run
down
the
stairs
and
without
regaining
your
breath
grab
the
handle
of
another
and
slowly
toil
up
again
to
the
ambulances
yes
even
on
the
coldest
day
it
was
possible
to
be
moist
with
perspiration
and
as
for
the
hot
weather
of
the
summer
when
one
of
our
big
pushes
was
afoot
or
when
returned
prisoners
came
from
germany
those
were
memorable
occasions
you
might
be
pardoned
a
certain
aching
in
the
it
was
on
one
of
these
busy
days
that
i
discovered
that
the
comical
prejudice
of
khaki
against
the
bluebottles
was
not
as
i
had
hitherto
supposed
confined
to
the
young
swashbucklers
of
the
it
was
seldom
our
custom
to
enter
the
hospital
trains
an
unwritten
law
decreed
that
bluebottles
only
should
enter
the
train
the
limited
themselves
to
carrying
work
outside
on
the
platform
and
stair
but
on
this
occasion
the
supply
of
bluebottles
had
for
the
moment
run
short
and
our
party
took
a
turn
at
going
up
the
gangways
and
evacuating
the
as
it
happened
i
and
my
mate
on
the
stretcher
were
the
first
to
invade
that
particular
and
as
we
steered
our
stretcher
in
at
the
door
and
down
the
aisle
of
cots
a
shout
arose
from
the
wounded
lying
there
here
are
some
real
soldiers
it
was
too
bad
it
was
base
ingratitude
to
the
devoted
band
of
bluebottles
who
had
up
till
that
instant
been
toiling
at
the
evacuation
of
the
ward
and
who
as
i
chanced
to
know
had
been
up
all
the
previous
night
carrying
stretchers
at
paddington
and
charing
cross
while
slept
cosily
but
well
there
it
was
here
are
some
real
soldiers
khaki
greeted
khaki
simultaneously
spurning
the
mere
amateur
the
civilian
i
could
have
blushed
for
the
injustice
of
that
naïve
cry
but
it
would
be
dishonest
not
to
confess
that
there
was
something
gratifying
about
it
too
it
was
the
cry
of
the
army
always
loyal
to
the
army
these
heroic
bundles
of
bandages
lifting
wild
and
unshaven
faces
from
their
pillows
hailed
a
wretched
creature
who
had
never
heard
a
gun
go
off
as
one
of
their
comrades
my
mate
and
i
as
we
adjusted
our
stretcher
at
a
cot
side
and
braced
ourselves
against
the
weight
of
the
patient
winked
covertly
at
one
another
a
nasty
one
for
the
bluebottles
he
said
and
it
was
all
the
same
i
seize
this
opportunity
of
offering
my
homage
to
the
bluebottles
they
have
done
are
still
doing
their
bit
and
that
right
nobly
thousands
of
british
soldiers
have
cause
to
bless
them
and
also
to
be
thankful
for
the
existence
of
that
great
voluntary
institution
the
london
ambulance
column
when
at
last
the
train
had
been
emptied
and
the
ultimate
stretcher
was
for
the
hospital
our
party
gathered
once
more
at
the
top
of
the
stair
lined
up
and
was
by
the
corporal
lest
any
man
had
seized
the
opportunity
to
play
truant
there
were
occasions
when
some
thirsty
soul
chafing
at
the
rigours
of
the
strict
teetotalism
enforced
by
our
rules
was
found
to
have
vanished
in
the
his
destination
the
being
readily
surmisable
he
had
cause
to
regret
his
lapse
if
it
were
noticed
before
he
slipped
back
unostentatiously
into
our
ranks
then
party
left
turn
right
incline
quick
march
off
we
swung
out
into
the
streets
cheered
by
the
urchins
who
still
hovered
round
the
gate
and
so
at
the
rapidest
possible
pace
home
to
dinner
and
a
smoke
these
in
my
case
at
any
rate
being
preceded
by
the
thankful
relinquishment
of
my
and
therefore
none
too
friendly
xiv
slang
in
a
war
hospital
every
ward
in
the
hospital
has
a
bathroom
attached
to
it
but
in
addition
to
these
there
are
two
large
bathrooms
each
containing
a
number
of
baths
which
are
used
by
walking
patients
and
also
by
the
orderlies
the
more
recently
built
of
these
bathrooms
is
divided
into
private
cubicles
in
the
older
one
the
baths
are
on
a
more
sociable
plan
with
no
partition
walls
sundering
them
the
spectacle
in
the
old
bathroom
when
a
convoy
of
walking
cases
has
arrived
is
one
which
should
appeal
to
a
painter
clouds
of
steam
fill
the
air
and
through
the
fog
you
perceive
a
fine
mêlée
of
figures
some
half
dressed
some
statuesquely
nude
towelling
themselves
or
preparing
to
wash
or
shaving
at
bits
of
mirror
propped
on
the
pink
bodies
wallow
voluptuously
in
the
deep
tubs
which
are
of
the
shape
and
superb
dimensions
of
egyptian
sarcophagi
sometimes
a
patient
with
a
wounded
arm
unable
to
help
himself
is
being
soaped
and
sponged
by
an
orderly
or
you
may
see
a
cheerful
soul
with
an
injured
foot
balanced
on
the
rim
of
the
bath
and
giving
himself
all
the
ablutions
which
are
practicable
without
the
disturbance
of
bandages
no
one
who
has
frequented
our
bathrooms
would
ever
doubt
that
the
british
army
loves
cleanliness
and
hot
water
of
cold
water
i
can
not
speak
with
the
same
enthusiasm
a
convoy
of
course
monopolises
the
bathroom
but
throughout
the
whole
day
at
almost
any
hour
you
will
find
a
patient
or
two
here
for
by
the
rule
of
the
hospital
it
is
allowable
for
any
patient
once
he
has
been
given
permission
to
take
an
unsupervised
bath
at
all
to
take
a
bath
whenever
he
likes
consequently
it
happens
often
that
half
a
dozen
orderlies
may
be
bathing
at
the
same
time
as
half
a
dozen
patients
and
it
need
not
be
added
that
the
occasion
is
one
for
pleasant
chats
and
the
barter
of
anecdotes
for
this
reason
if
for
no
other
i
always
elected
to
use
the
old
bathroom
the
new
one
with
its
closed
cubicles
was
less
fruitful
in
conversations
the
old
bathroom
was
the
exchange
and
perhaps
the
of
many
of
our
hospital
rumours
i
imagine
that
every
war
hospital
is
a
hotbed
of
rumours
ours
certainly
was
and
is
amongst
the
orderlies
there
are
incessant
rumours
about
promotions
about
the
chances
of
the
unit
being
sent
abroad
about
surprise
inspections
about
the
imminent
arrival
of
impossibly
large
convoys
about
news
received
privately
by
the
colonel
over
the
telephone
of
defeats
or
victories
nine
times
out
of
ten
the
rumour
turns
out
to
be
groundless
but
this
does
not
cause
the
output
of
rumours
to
diminish
apparently
the
army
is
a
prolific
soil
for
rumours
inasmuch
as
they
have
a
special
name
a
rumour
is
called
a
only
a
buzz
it
only
a
rumour
is
an
expression
often
heard
on
the
lips
of
soldiers
in
india
it
is
sometimes
a
bazaar
buzz
a
rumour
circulating
in
the
bazaars
here
it
is
naturally
a
bathroom
buzz
many
were
the
choice
examples
of
slang
and
of
colloquialisms
which
i
culled
in
the
bathroom
sitting
comfortably
in
my
bath
and
communing
with
my
neighbour
in
the
next
bath
i
remember
one
morning
making
the
acquaintance
of
an
australian
who
had
recently
recovered
from
a
bad
attack
of
trench
feet
four
of
the
toes
of
one
foot
were
missing
and
the
fifth
looked
far
from
sound
my
friend
was
examining
this
lonely
toe
with
a
critical
gaze
and
i
sympathised
with
him
over
its
condition
ah
he
said
that
toe
is
a
king
to
what
it
was
he
went
on
to
tell
me
what
i
could
well
believe
that
to
get
your
plates
of
meat
frostbitten
was
such
a
cushy
wound
as
it
was
cracked
up
to
be
by
those
who
had
never
experienced
its
sufferings
when
i
went
sick
the
doctor
thought
he
rumbled
me
swinging
the
lead
but
as
soon
as
he
spotted
them
there
toes
of
mine
the
ones
that
gone
i
could
see
he
knew
i
clicked
a
packet
square
dinkum
this
trip
square
dinkum
or
dinkum
is
an
antipodean
verbal
flourish
which
broadly
approximates
to
the
american
sure
enough
or
the
english
not
certain
of
these
neologisms
are
common
enough
in
civilian
life
have
been
imported
into
the
army
since
but
others
and
the
more
interesting
ones
as
i
hold
were
until
the
war
limited
to
the
british
regiments
which
had
been
abroad
used
an
argot
of
considerable
antiquity
some
of
it
of
oriental
origin
blighty
meaning
home
hence
a
blighty
wound
or
simply
a
blighty
an
injury
sufficiently
serious
to
cause
the
victim
to
be
invalided
to
england
whether
the
derivations
of
army
slang
have
been
investigated
i
do
not
know
it
appears
to
me
to
be
a
subject
worth
examination
i
am
not
myself
a
philologist
but
in
the
bathrooms
and
elsewhere
in
the
hospital
i
have
heard
and
noted
a
small
collection
of
slang
phrases
and
idioms
and
these
may
be
worth
recording
such
expressions
as
swinging
the
lead
malingering
or
deceiving
or
acting
in
a
hypocritical
manner
or
getting
the
better
of
anyone
have
lost
their
novelty
so
has
rumbled
which
means
to
be
discovered
or
detected
or
found
out
these
words
have
now
spread
far
beyond
the
confines
of
the
army
and
indeed
the
rapidity
with
which
all
slang
and
all
can
be
disseminated
offers
a
rather
alarming
prospect
for
whereas
before
the
war
slang
at
its
silliest
was
often
quite
local
nowadays
its
restriction
within
given
localities
has
in
the
nature
of
things
become
impossible
a
war
hospital
such
as
ours
contains
inmates
from
every
county
in
britain
as
well
as
from
every
colony
the
same
intermingling
occurs
on
an
infinitely
greater
scale
in
and
at
the
various
fronts
all
these
centres
are
hotbeds
of
slang
the
men
go
home
from
them
carrying
to
their
native
places
slang
which
would
never
in
ordinary
times
have
penetrated
there
in
the
army
you
will
hear
a
scotchman
doing
what
he
never
did
before
dropping
his
aitches
he
has
caught
it
from
his
english
comrades
you
will
hear
him
say
not
an
inane
tag
which
despite
its
popularity
in
london
failed
to
find
any
foothold
north
of
the
tweed
before
the
war
not
was
mouthed
by
sassenach
comedians
on
the
stages
of
edinburgh
and
glasgow
and
was
grinned
at
for
what
it
was
worth
the
streets
did
not
adopt
it
now
the
streets
will
hear
it
and
will
use
it
it
is
one
of
jock
souvenirs
from
his
campaign
i
am
afraid
that
another
triviality
which
has
hitherto
been
to
the
taste
only
of
the
south
of
england
is
fated
to
catch
on
by
means
of
the
same
missionaries
from
land
end
to
john
o
groat
and
even
in
the
colonies
rhyming
slang
is
extraordinarily
common
in
the
army
so
common
that
it
is
used
with
complete
unconsciousness
as
being
correct
conversational
english
my
friend
of
the
toe
spoke
of
his
feet
as
plates
of
meat
and
this
though
he
was
an
australian
not
a
cockney
if
he
had
had
occasion
to
allude
to
his
leg
he
would
probably
have
called
it
scotch
peg
a
man
arm
is
his
false
alarm
his
nose
i
suppose
his
eye
mince
pie
his
hand
german
band
his
boot
daisy
root
his
face
chevvy
chase
and
so
forth
an
interminable
list
what
exactly
was
the
of
this
mania
i
do
not
know
but
i
suspect
that
it
originated
in
the
distant
past
with
the
poverty
of
on
the
part
of
the
writers
of
the
cruder
kind
of
pantomime
songs
round
the
houses
for
example
being
both
a
rhyme
to
and
a
synonym
for
trousies
garments
beloved
of
those
bards
and
thus
the
vogue
developed
this
is
only
a
theory
the
one
thing
certain
is
that
a
clumsy
form
of
slang
devoid
of
the
humour
and
compactness
which
justify
slang
and
which
were
on
the
whole
once
characteristic
of
metropolitan
slang
has
tickled
the
ear
of
some
millions
of
men
who
but
for
the
war
would
never
have
fallen
under
its
temptation
the
only
thing
to
hope
for
is
that
it
will
run
its
course
and
perish
like
what
ho
she
bumps
and
now
we
sha
be
long
without
leaving
any
visible
and
permanent
trace
upon
the
language
clicked
another
word
used
by
my
associate
resembles
much
modern
slang
in
the
breadth
and
elasticity
of
its
application
to
click
can
be
either
advantageous
or
baneful
according
to
the
circumstances
a
soldier
asks
a
superior
for
a
favour
and
it
is
granted
that
soldier
has
clicked
or
if
he
finds
a
nice
girl
to
walk
out
with
he
has
clicked
or
if
he
is
given
a
coveted
post
he
has
clicked
but
he
has
also
clicked
if
he
is
suddenly
seized
on
to
do
some
menial
duty
he
has
clicked
if
he
is
discovered
in
a
misdeed
and
he
has
clicked
a
packet
if
he
gets
into
trouble
generally
on
such
an
occasion
it
may
be
added
the
or
officer
who
administers
a
reproof
ticks
him
off
and
does
so
in
angry
terms
goes
in
off
the
deep
end
not
all
army
slang
is
lacking
indeed
in
a
facetious
irony
miserable
conditions
in
the
desert
or
in
the
trenches
bad
accommodation
doubtful
food
anything
which
can
not
arouse
the
faintest
enthusiasm
of
any
sort
these
in
the
lingo
of
our
now
and
stoical
troops
are
nothing
to
write
home
about
surely
there
is
an
admirable
spirit
in
this
sarcasm
it
crops
up
again
in
the
hospital
metaphor
going
to
the
pictures
that
is
tommy
way
of
announcing
that
he
is
to
go
under
the
surgeon
knife
on
a
visit
to
the
operating
theatre
again
there
is
a
sardonic
tang
in
the

of
one
who
has
been

has

the

of

in

in

when
they
had
been
on

took
their

down
to

but
who
can
delve
to
the
ultimate
springs
of
slang
a
verb
which
i
never
met
before
i
enlisted
was
to
spruce
this
is
almost
if
not
quite
a
blend
of
swinging
the
lead
and
doing
a
mike
to
spruce
is
to
dodge
duty
or
to
deceive
a
man
who
contrived
to
slip
out
of
the
ranks
of
a
squad
when
they
were
performing
some
distasteful
task
would
be
said
to
spruce
off

he
would
be
denounced
as
a
sprucer

he
managed

arrive
late
for

meal

yet
by
a
trick
to
secure
a
front
place
in
the
waiting
queue
at
the
canteen
a
word
in
constant
employment
spruce
it
was
new
to
me
when
i
became
an
orderly
and
for
a
long
time
i
thought
that
it
was
peculiar
to
our
unit
in
the
same
manner
that
the
jargon
of
certain
boys
is
peculiar
to
certain
schools
but
i
concluded
later
that
it
might
have
a
remote
and
roundabout
origin
in
the
old
army
slang
a
spruce
hand
at
brag
the
latter
being
a
variant
of
the
game
of
poker
and
a
spruce
hand
apparently
one
which
held
by
a
bluffer
contained
cards
of
no
real
value
some
day
these
etymological
mysteries
must
be
probed
perhaps
the
german
professors
after
the
war
can
usefully
wreak
themselves
on
this
complex
and
obscure
research
meanwhile
the
above
notes
are
offered
not
as
a
serious
contribution
to
a
subject
so
immense
but
rather
as
a
warning
the
infectiousness
of
slang
is
incredible
and
this
gigantic
of
classes
and
clans
has
brought
about
a
hitherto
of
the
common
speech
accent
may
or
may
not
be
influenced
the
vocabulary
undoubtedly
is
nearly
every
home
in
the
land
is
soon
going
to
be
invaded
by
many
forms
of
army
slang
the
process
in
fact
has
already
begun
if
we
were
a
sprightlier
nation
the
effect
might
not
be
all
to
the
bad
but
most
of
our
are
not
wits
he
was
balmy
a
treat
i
heard
a
soldier
say
of
another
soldier
who
had
shammed
insane
that
is
what
we
are
coming
to
it
is
the
tongue
we
shall
use
and
likewise
i
fear
the
condition
in
which
some
of
us
will
find
ourselves
as
a
result
xv
a
blind
man
in
my
boyhood
i
had
the
ambition
it
was
one
of
several
ambitions
to
become
a
courier
the
advertisements
of
couriers
who
professed
to
be
fluent
in
a
number
of
languages
and
were
at
the
disposal
of
invalid
aristocrats
desiring
to
take
extensive
and
expensive
trips
abroad
aroused
the
most
romantic
visions
in
my
mind
a
courier
was
the
life
for
me
i
saw
myself
whirling
all
over
europe
with
my
distinguished
invalid
in
de
luxe
anon
we
were
crossing
the
atlantic
or
lolling
in
breezes
on
the
verandahs
of
far
eastern
hotels
it
was
a
great
profession
that
of
the
experienced
and
successful
courier
i
have
never
been
a
courier
in
quite
this
picturesque
acceptation
and
yet
in
a
humbler
sense
i
have
perhaps
to
my
own
surprise
earned
the
title
as
an
orderly
i
have
more
than
once
officiated
as
travelling
courier
yes
and
to
distinguished
if
far
from
affluent
invalids
they
ought
at
least
to
rank
as
distinguished
for
the
reason
they
needed
a
courier
was
because
they
had
given
their
health
or
limbs
or
eyesight
in
defence
of
their
country
it
happens
only
too
often
that
when
a
patient
is
discharged
from
hospital
he
is
not
fit
to
make
his
journey
home
alone
an
orderly
is
detailed
to
accompany
him
sometimes
the
lot
has
fallen
on
me
generally
the
trip
is
a
short
one
to
some
outlying
suburb
of
london
or
to
some
town
or
village
in
the
home
counties
but
sometimes
my
flights
have
been
further
afield
to
ireland
or
wales
and
once
i
went
to
yorkshire
with
a
blind
man
that
yorkshire
expedition
was
singularly
lacking
in
drama
and
in
surface
pathos
yet
its
details
remain
with
great
clearness
the
piece
of
damaged
goods
which
being
of
no
further
fighting
use
was
being
returned
with
thanks
to
the
hearthside
from
whence
it
came
was
an
individual
answering
to
the
unheroic
cognomen
of
briggs
a
shell
had
been
sent
by
the
gods
to
alter
the
current
of
briggs
career
briggs
came
through
all
that
part
of
the
war
which
concerned
him
without
a
scratch
upon
his
person
only
after
the
arrival
in
his
immediate
vicinity
of
the
shell
he
was
unfortunately
unable
to
see
never
again
would
briggs
be
of
the
slightest
value
either
as
a
soldier
or
in
his
civilian
trade
which
was
that
of
driver
of
ponies
in
a
consequently
as
a
distinguished
invalid
with
the
sum
of
one
pound
in
his
pocket
to
comfort
him
until
such
time
as
his
pension
should
materialise
mister
no
longer
private
briggs
for
the
first
and
presumably
the
last
time
in
his
existence
went
travelling
with
a
courier
a
car
supplied
by
the
national
motor
volunteer
service
awaited
briggs
and
his
courier
at
the
hospital
entrance
here
the
introduction
between
briggs
and
his
courier
took
place
ours
is
a
large
hospital
and
i
had
never
to
my
knowledge
encountered
briggs
before
that
moment
i
beheld
a
young
fellow
he
was
only
with
a
stout
healthy
visage
which
wore
a
pleasant
smile
and
would
have
been
describable
as
roguish
only
well
the
eyes
of
a
blind
man
whatever
else
they
are
are
not
conducive
to
a
roguish
mien
they
were
eyes
not
visibly
damaged
nice
blue
eyes
and
they
stared
at
nothingness
i
was
in
the
presence
of
a
stripling
who
a
few
weeks
ago
must
have
owned
a
mobile
face
and
was
in
rapid
process
of
developing
a
quite
different
face
a
face
which
still
might
it
certainly
did
grin
and
laugh
but
which
would
gradually
gain
had
already
begun
to
gain
a
set
expressionlessness
that
overlaid
and
strangely
neutralised
its
grins
and
its
laughter
blind
men
faces
may
have
beauty
even
vivacity
or
a
heightened
intelligence
and
fire
but
there
is
a
something
hard
to
define
of
which
they
are
sadly
devoid
the
windows
of
the
soul
are
dimmed
the
face
inevitably
changes
and
if
even
i
who
knew
not
briggs
could
perceive
that
briggs
face
must
thus
have
changed
how
much
more
conspicuous
would
the
change
be
to
the
partner
whom
briggs
had
left
seven
months
before
and
to
whom
i
was
now
leading
him
back
his
wife
briggs
a
civilian
once
more
sported
garments
which
fitted
him
surprisingly
our
clothing
store
sergeant
is
the
kindest
of
souls
and
expends
infinite
patience
on
doing
his
best
with
tailoring
to
suit
all
our
discharges
his
overcoat
which
might
have
been
called
a
chesterfield
in
shoreditch
pleased
briggs
as
he
told
me
in
the
car
he
drew
my
attention
to
its
texture
and
warmth
he
admiringly
fingered
it
i
might
ha
paid
thirty
bob
for
that
there
he
surmised
a
collar
an
a
tie
an
all
too
them
boots
ai
so
dusty
neither
they
fit
me
a
treat
goin
to
my
missus
in
sunday
clobber
i
am
you
would
have
said
that
he
thought
he
had
emerged
from
his
hazards
with
rather
a
good
bargain
a
jumble
of
clothes
and
a
pension
the
visible
world
gone
for
ever
these
were
his
souvenirs
of
the
great
war
and
ah
he
said
when
i
ventured
on
some
allusion
to
his
blindness
it
might
ha
bin
worse
i
don
know
what
i
ha
done
if
i
lost
a
leg
same
as
some
of
them
other
poor
jossers
in
th
hospital
and
this
marvellous
though
it
sounds
is
the
standpoint
of
no
small
number
in
the
legion
of
our
briggses
the
motor
ride
was
another
source
of
gratification
to
briggs
seated
beside
me
the
wind
beating
on
his
sightless
orbs
he
discoursed
of
the
wonders
of
petrol
proper
to
take
you
about
them
cars
are
we
now
we
far
to
run
like
i
told
him
we
were
traversing
battersea
park
and
that
our
destination
was
pancras
it
transpired
that
he
was
a
stranger
to
london
this
drive
through
london
was
as
it
were
an
item
in
his
collection
of
experiences
to
be
preserved
with
the
voyage
and
the
vigils
in
the
trenches
shall
we
go
by
buckingham
palace
i
told
him
we
should
then
observing
that
he
was
disappointed
i
asked
the
driver
to
make
the
détour
so
at
last
i
was
able
to
inform
briggs
that
we
were
passing
buckingham
palace
i
turned
his
head
so
that
he
looked
straight
towards
that
architectural
phenomenon
it
was
of
course
invisible
to
him
no
matter
he
wished
to
be
able
to
boast
to
his
wife
that
he
had
seen
he
used
that
verb
the
house
where
the
king
lived
his
wife
he
married
a
month
before
he
enlisted
had
been
notified
of
his
return
but
i
suggested
that
at
pancras
we
might
telegraph
to
her
the
actual
hour
of
the
train
arrival
in
case
she
should
desire
to
meet
it
the
idea
commended
itself
to
briggs
he
had
not
thought
of
such
a
thing
telegraphing
had
perhaps
hardly
come
within
his
purview
at
least
so
i
surmised
when
the
before
me
i
asked
him
what
he
wished
me
to
write
he
began
cheerily
as
though
dictating
a
letter
of
gossip
dear
economy
necessitated
a
taboo
of
this
otherwise
charming
method
of
communication
bradford
was
the
result
of
final
which
took
so
long
that
we
nearly
achieved
the
anticlimax
of
missing
our
train
altogether
now
at
bradford
at
the
end
of
one
of
the
chattiest
five
hours
i
ever
spent
in
my
life
no
briggs
was
perceptible
i
kept
my
patient
on
the
platform
until
every
other
passenger
had
gone
i
marched
him
up
and
down
the
main
area
of
the
station
each
time
i
caught
sight
of
a
woman
who
looked
a
possible
briggs
i
steered
my
charge
into
her
vicinity
in
spite
of
a
piece
of
information
which
briggs
had
imparted
to
me
on
the
journey
namely
that
he
expected
soon
to
become
a
father
i
was
surprised
that
his
wife
had
not
come
to
the
station
to
welcome
him
however
it
was
plain
that
briggs
himself
was
not
particularly
surprised
nor
what
was
more
important
disappointed
nothing
could
damp
his
eternal
placidity
and
good
humour
he
proposed
that
from
this
point
onward
he
should
pursue
his
journey
alone
nowt
to
do
but
git
on
th
tram
he
said
it
a
fair
step
from
but
i
knows
every
inch
of
t
way
at
all
events
as
of
course
i
could
not
allow
this
he
would
now
act
as
my
guide
and
he
did
first
to
the
right
now
we
by
a
big
now
cross
t
street
now
on
th
corner
over
there
by
t
sinnemer
is
we
git
our
tram
the
tram
in
due
course
appeared
and
we
boarded
it
tha
mun
pay
thrippence
only
mind
he
warned
me
when
the
conductor
came
round
it
a
rare
long
ride
for
thrippence
so
it
proved
to
be
through
wildernesses
which
were
half
meadow
and
half
slum
my
cicerone
at
every
hundred
yards
pointing
out
the
notable
features
of
the
landscape
on
our
left
i
ought
to
see
the
public
house
on
our
right
the
football
ground
i
should
know
it
by
the
jutting
above
the
palings
further
on
were
brickworks
further
still
a
factory
which
my
nose
would
have
told
me
even
if
briggs
had
not
dealt
with
chemicals
then
on
the
skyline
a
then
another
then
a
mining
village
with
three
different
kinds
of
methodist
church
and
two
picture
palaces
then
a
gap
of
dreary
dirty
fields
and
then
nearing
dusk
the
village
where
my
friend
lived
and
where
also
was
the
terminus
of
the
tram
route
we
quitted
the
tram
and
walked
down
a
street
of
those
squalid
brick
tenements
which
seems
to
germinate
like
a
rash
upon
the
earth
surface
the
debris
and
the
scaffoldings
of
pits
were
dotted
about
the
adjacent
countryside
sooty
occupied
the
occasional
interspaces
in
the
ranks
of
houses
briggs
directed
me
across
a
cinder
path
in
one
of
these
see
them
three
at
the
bottom
of
the
the
end
one
mine
we
approached
no
sign
of
the
wife
surely
she
would
be
on
the
for
her
husband
also
there
was
a
sister
and
a
the
latter
in
a
prosperous
way
of
business
as
a
grocer
briggs
had
told
me
of
them
would
not
they
be
watching
for
him
i
began
to
be
anxious
not
once
but
several
times
i
had
heard
of
the
wounded
soldier
returning
to
his
home
and
finding
no
home
both
home
and
wife
had
gone
those
are
bitterly
tragic
tales
which
a
realist
must
write
some
day
still
as
we
came
nearer
i
saw
nobody
at
the
cottage
door
is
th
door
open
asked
briggs
yes
it
was
open
when
we
were
at
the
end
of
the
and
i
could
discern
the
interior
of
the
cottage
parlour
into
which
the
door
opened
direct
it
became
clear
that
three
persons
were
there
one
of
them
a
man
obviously
the
came
and
peeped
out
of
the
window
at
us
and
turned
and
spoke
to
his
companions
of
these
two
both
women
one
rose
from
her
chair
and
the
other
remained
seated
but
none
of
the
three
came
to
the
door
i
have
met
northern
dourness
and
the
inarticulate
manner
which
is
such
a
contrast
to
the
gushing
and
noisy
effusion
of
the
south
by
a
paradox
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
familiar
conversationalism
to
which
briggs
had
treated
me
a
stranger
but
i
admit
i
found
briggs
family
circle
a
little
embarrassing
they
were
respectable
people
the
cottage
was
neat
and
decently
furnished
its
occupants
were
sprucely
dressed
i
fancy
they
were
in
their
best
clothes
certainly
their
demeanour
and
the
aspect
of
the
table
in
their
midst
denoted
a
great
occasion
this
table
as
i
saw
when
i
assisted
briggs
up
the
steps
into
the
room
had
indeed
borne
a
tea
no
very
acute
powers
of
deduction
were
required
to
decide
from
the
crumbs
on
the
white
cloth
and
on
the
dishes
that
there
been
bread
and
butter
and
jam
and
cake
of
these
not
a
vestige
except
the
crumbs
remained
briggs
and
i
were
an
hour
behindhand
and
the
relatives
who
awaited
the
wanderer
had
eaten
the
banquet
laid
to
welcome
him
or
so
it
appeared
i
have
no
doubt
that
all
sorts
of
delicacies
were
in
the
cupboard
the
kettle
on
the
hob
was
probably
on
the
boil
perhaps
buttered
toast
was
in
the
oven
the
fact
remains
that
devastation
was
on
the
table
however
briggs
did
not
see
the
table
and
the
table
state
occupied
me
only
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
i
was
more
concerned
with
the
three
people
in
the
parlour
and
with
their
reception
of
my
patient
the
pale
woman
in
the
chair
by
the
fire
was
evidently
briggs
wife
she
stared
at
us
as
we
entered
but
said
absolutely
nothing
nor
did
the
other
and
slightly
younger
woman
his
sister
say
anything
she
too
stared
and
the
man
stared
and
said
nothing
well
here
we
are
i
announced
an
imbecile
assertion
but
i
produced
it
as
cheerfully
and
as
i
knew
how
i
unhooked
my
arm
from
briggs
and
made
as
though
to
push
him
forward
into
the
family
group
nay
said
briggs
i
mun
take
my
off
first
i
helped
him
off
with
his
coat
not
one
of
the
three
members
of
his
family
had
either
moved
or
spoken
beyond
one
faint
murmur
not
an
actual
word
in
response
to
my
here
we
are
but
briggs
seemed
to
know
that
his
folk
were
in
the
room
with
him
and
he
neither
accosted
them
expressed
any
curiosity
about
them
or
betrayed
any
astonishment
at
their
silence
when
he
had
got
his
coat
off
i
expected
him
to
move
forward
into
the
room
a
mistake
mine
must
be
a
hasty
temperament
they
do
do
things
like
that
in
yorkshire
not
even
when
they
have
come
home
blinded
from
the
wars
briggs
put
out
his
hand
felt
for
the
cottage
door
half
closed
it
felt
for
a
nail
on
the
inner
side
of
it
and
carefully
hung
his
coat
thereon
i
could
usher
him
into
the
waiting
family
circle
no
i
was
wrong
briggs
calmly
divested
himself
of
his
jacket
he
then
felt
for
another
door
a
door
which
opened
on
to
a
stair
leading
to
the
upper
storey
on
a
nail
in
this
door
he
hung
his
jacket
and
then
in
his
he
was
ready
were
symbolical
he
was
home
at
last
and
prepared
to
sit
down
with
his
people
of
the
actual
reunion
i
saw
nothing
for
i
promptly
said
i
must
go
it
was
imperative
for
me
to
hurry
back
or
i
should
miss
my
train
you
stay
an
take
a
sup
of
tea
with
us
said
briggs
i
could
though
i
should
have
liked
to
do
so
in
some
ways
and
in
others
should
have
hardly
dared
to
be
an
intruder
on
such
a
meeting
i
shook
hands
with
my
patient
looking
back
as
i
went
out
of
the
door
i
saw
briggs
wife
still
seated
motionless
in
her
chair
she
had
not
opened
her
lips
it
was
impossible
to
divine
what
were
her
emotions
she
was
very
pale
there
were
no
tears
in
her
eyes
as
she
stared
at
her
young
blind
husband
but
i
think
there
were
tears
waiting
to
be
shed
i
looked
back
again
when
i
reached
the
end
of
the
path
across
the
the
cottage
door
was
still
open
in
the
aperture
stood
the
younger
of
the
two
women
briggs
sister
she
waved
to
me
and
smiled
it
was
evident
that
it
had
struck
her
that
i
ought
to
have
been
thanked
for
my
services
and
she
was
expressing
this
cordially
if
belatedly
i
waved
my
hand
in
return
and
hastened
up
the
street
towards
the
tram
my
hurry
was
fruitless
i
missed
my
train
in
bradford
and
stayed
the
night
at
an
hotel
thus
with
appropriate
but
improper
extravagance
concluding
this
particular
performance
in
the
rôle
of
travelling
courier
to
a
distinguished
invalid
as
i
sat
over
a
sumptuous
table
this
was
long
before
the
submarine
blockade
and
the
food
restrictions
i
wondered
what
briggs
wife
said
to
briggs
and
i
made
up
a
story
about
it
but
what
i
have
written
above
is
not
a
story
it
is
the
unadorned
truth
which
i
could
not
have
invented
and
which
is
perhaps
better
than
the
story
in
his
courier
presence
briggs
addressed
not
one
word
to
his
wife
and
his
wife
addressed
not
one
word
to
him
nor
did
his
sister
or
his
nor
did
any
of
this
trio
address
one
word
