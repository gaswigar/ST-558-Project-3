by

we
would
have
you
to
wit
that
on
eggs
though
we
sit
and
are
spiked
on
the
spit
and
are
baked
in
a
pan
birds
are
older
by
far
than
your
ancestors
are
and
made
love
and
made
war
ere
the
making
of
man
a
party
of
swallows
perched
on
the
telegraph
wires
beside
the
highway
where
it
passed
orchard
farm
they
were
resting
after
a
breakfast
of
insects
which
they
had
caught
on
the
wing
after
the
custom
of
their
family
as
it
was
only
the
first
of
may
they
had
plenty
of
time
before
and
so
were
having
a
little
neighborly
chat
if
you
had
glanced
at
these
birds
carelessly
you
might
have
thought
they
were
all
of
one
kind
but
they
were
not
the
smallest
was
the
bank
swallow
a
little
fellow
with
a
short
tail
his
back
feathers
looking
like
a
dusty
brown
cloak
fastened
in
front
by
a
between
his
light
throat
and
breast
next
to
him
perched
the
barn
swallow
a
bit
larger
with
a
tail
like
an
open
pair
of
glistening
scissors
and
his
face
and
throat
a
beautiful
ruddy
buff
there
were
so
many
glints
of
color
on
his
back
and
wings
as
he
spread
them
in
the
sun
that
it
seemed
as
if
in
some
of
his
nights
he
must
have
collided
with
a
great
which
left
its
shifting
hues
upon
him
as
it
burst
this
barn
swallow
was
very
much
worried
about
something
and
talked
so
fast
to
his
friend
the
tree
swallow
that
his
words
sounded
like
twitters
and
giggles
but
you
would
know
they
were
words
if
you
could
only
understand
them
the
tree
swallow
wore
a
cloak
and
a
spotless
white
vest
he
was
trying
to
be
polite
and
listen
to
the
barn
swallow
as
well
as
to
the
purple
martin
the
biggest
swallow
of
all
who
was
a
little
further
along
on
the
wire
but
as
they
both
spoke
at
once
he
found
it
a
difficult
matter
we
shall
all
be
turned
out
i
know
complained
the
barn
swallow
and
after
we
have
as
good
as
owned
orchard
farm
these
three
years
it
is
too
bad
those
meddlesome
house
people
have
put
two
new
pieces
of
glass
in
the
hayloft
window
and
how
shall
i
ever
get
in
to
build
my
nest
they
may
leave
the
window
open
said
the
bank
swallow
soothingly
for
he
had
a
cheerful
disposition
i
have
noticed
that
hayloft
windows
are
usually
left
open
in
warm
weather
yes
they
may
leave
it
open
and
then
shut
it
some
day
after
i
have
gone
in
snapped
barney
darting
off
the
perch
to
catch
a
fly
and
grasping
the
wire
so
violently
on
his
return
that
the
other
birds
fluttered
and
almost
lost
their
footing
what
is
all
this
trouble
about
asked
the
martin
in
his
soft
rich
voice
i
live
ten
miles
further
up
country
and
only
pass
here
twice
a
year
so
that
i
do
not
know
the
latest
news
why
must
you
leave
the
farm
it
seems
to
be
a
charming
place
for
bird
people
i
see
a
little
box
under
the
barn
eaves
that
would
make
me
a
fine
house
it
a
delightful
place
for
us
replied
the
barn
swallow
but
now
the
house
people
who
own
the
farm
are
coming
back
to
live
here
themselves
and
everything
is
turned
they
should
have
asked
us
if
we
were
willing
for
them
to
come
bird
people
are
of
a
older
race
than
house
people
anyway
it
says
so
in
their
books
for
i
heard
rap
the
lame
boy
down
by
the
mill
reading
about
it
one
day
when
he
was
sitting
by
the
river
all
the
other
birds
laughed
merrily
at
this
and
the
martin
said
be
greedy
brother
barney
those
people
are
quite
welcome
to
their
barns
and
houses
if
they
will
only
let
us
build
in
their
trees
bird
people
own
the
whole
sky
and
some
of
our
race
dive
in
the
sea
and
swim
in
the
rivers
where
no
house
people
can
follow
us
you
may
say
what
you
please
chattered
poor
unhappy
barney
everything
is
awry
the
wrens
always
built
behind
the
and
now
these
blinds
are
flung
wide
open
the
song
sparrow
nested
in
the
long
grass
under
the
lilac
bushes
but
now
it
is
all
cut
short
and
they
have
trimmed
away
the
nice
mossy
branches
in
the
orchard
where
hundreds
of
the
brothers
built
besides
this
the
bluebird
made
his
nest
in
a
hole
in
the
top
of
the
old
gate
post
and
what
have
those
people
done
but
put
up
a
new
post
with
hole
in
dear
dear
think
of
it
of
it
sang
the
bluebird
softly
taking
his
place
on
the
wire
with
the
others
what
if
these
people
should
bring
children
with
them
continued
barney
who
had
not
finished
airing
his
grievances
little
boys
and
cats
children
who
might
climb
up
to
our
nests
and
steal
our
eggs
boys
with
perhaps
and
striped
cats
which
no
one
can
see
with
feet
that
make
no
sound
and
claws
and
teeth
it
makes
me
shiver
to
think
of
it
and
all
the
birds
shook
so
that
the
wire
quivered
and
the
bank
swallow
fell
off
or
would
have
fallen
if
he
had
not
spread
his
wings
and
saved
himself
the
martin
had
nothing
to
say
to
this
but
the
little
bank
swallow
though
somewhat
shaken
up
whispered
there
be
children
who
do
not
rob
nests
and
other
boys
like
rap
who
would
never
shoot
us
cats
are
always
sad
things
for
birds
but
these
house
people
may
not
keep
any
and
then
he
moved
down
a
wire
or
two
frightened
at
having
given
his
opinion
at
that
moment
a
chimney
swift
joined
the
group
this
swift
who
nests
in
chimneys
is
the
bird
that
flies
and
feeds
on
the
wing
like
a
swallow
and
when
he
is
in
the
air
looks
like
a
big
spruce
cone
with
wings
he
was
followed
by
a
catbird
who
had
been
in
a
honeysuckle
by
one
of
the
farmhouse
windows
and
peeped
inside
out
of
curiosity
both
were
excited
and
evidently
bubbling
over
with
news
which
half
the
birds
of
the
orchard
were
following
them
to
hear
i
know
all
about
it
cried
the
swift
settling
himself
for
a
long
talk
i
the
house
people
screamed
the
catbird
they
wish
well
to
the
bird
people
and
we
shall
be
happier
than
before
squeaked
the
swift
breathless
and
eager
listen
and
the
birds
all
huddled
together
this
morning
when
i
flew
down
the
chimney
wondering
if
i
should
dare
build
my
nest
there
again
i
heard
a
noise
on
the
outside
so
i
dropped
as
far
as
i
could
and
listened
a
voice
said
bun
we
will
leave
this
chimney
for
the
birds
do
not
make
a
fire
here
until
after
they
have
nested
i
was
so
surprised
that
i
nearly
fell
into
the
grate
and
i
interrupted
the
catbird
was
looking
in
the
window
and
saw
the
man
who
spoke
and
mammy
bun
too
she
is
a
very
big
person
wide
like
a
and
has
a
dark
face
like
the
house
people
down
in
the
warm
country
where
i
spend
the
winter
there
are
children
at
the
farm
seen
them
too
cried
the
phoebe
who
usually
lived
under
the
eaves
of
the
three
of
them
one
big
girl
one
little
girl
and
a
boy
i
told
you
so
lisped
the
barn
swallow
and
a
chorus
of
and
arose
that
sounded
like
a
strange
message
buzzing
along
the
wires
the
boy
has
a
pocket
full
of
pebbles
and
a
gasped
the
phoebe
pausing
as
if
nothing
more
shocking
could
be
said
yes
but
the
big
girl
coaxed
the
shooter
away
from
him
said
the
chimney
swift
who
was
quite
provoked
because
his
story
had
been
interrupted
she
said
nat
father
wo
let
you
shoot
birds
here
or
do
anything
to
frighten
them
away
for
he
loves
them
and
has
spent
half
his
life
watching
them
and
learning
their
ways
and
they
have
grown
so
fearless
hereabouts
that
they
are
like
friends
but
nat
said
let
me
shoot
some
cousin
olive
i
do
see
why
uncle
roy
likes
them
what
good
are
birds
anyway
they
only
sit
in
the
street
and
say
chuck
chuck
chuck
all
day
long
say
that
because
you
have
always
lived
in
the
city
and
the
only
birds
you
have
watched
are
the
english
sparrows
who
are
really
as
disagreeable
as
birds
can
possibly
be
said
the
big
girl
here
you
will
see
all
the
beautiful
wild
birds
then
the
little
girl
said
brother
you
always
loved
our
canary
but
he
is
different
he
is
nice
and
yellow
and
he
knows
something
and
sings
too
like
everything
he
is
like
these
common
tree
birds
common
tree
birds
indeed
shrieked
the
catbird
that
is
what
the
boy
called
us
said
the
chimney
swift
who
then
went
on
with
his
story
about
what
he
had
heard
the
children
say
you
silly
dear
cried
the
big
girl
laughing
a
sweet
little
laugh
like
the
bobolink
song
only
proves
how
little
you
know
about
wild
birds
plenty
of
them
are
more
brightly
colored
than
your
canary
and
some
of
those
that
wear
the
plainest
feathers
sing
more
beautifully
than
all
the
canaries
and
cage
birds
in
the
world
this
summer
when
you
have
made
friends
with
these
wild
birds
and
they
have
let
you
see
their
homes
and
learn
their
secrets
you
will
make
up
your
mind
that
there
are
no
for
every
one
of
them
has
something
very
uncommon
about
it
then
our
brother
oriole
began
to
sing
in
the
sugar
maple
over
the
shed
the
sun
was
shining
on
his
gay
coat
the
little
girl
pointed
to
him
and
whispered
nat
you
see
olive
is
right
please
empty
the
stones
out
of
your
pocket
the
chimney
swift
had
hardly
finished
his
story
when
there
was
another
excitement
news
more
news
called
the
bank
swallow
joyfully
he
had
been
taking
a
skim
over
the
meadows
and
orchard
these
house
people
do
keep
cats
they
may
not
have
any
now
but
that
does
prove
they
never
will
said
a
robin
crossly
he
had
just
flown
against
a
window
not
understanding
about
the
glass
and
had
a
headache
in
consequence
they
will
keep
insisted
the
little
swallow
boldly
how
do
know
asked
the
birds
in
one
breath
because
they
keep
said
bankey
twittering
with
glee
two
nice
dogs
one
big
and
buff
and
bushy
with
a
much
finer
tail
than
the
proudest
fox
you
ever
saw
and
the
other
small
and
white
with
some
dark
spots
and
as
quick
as
a
squirrel
this
one
has
a
short
tail
that
sticks
up
like
a
wren
and
a
nose
like
a
weasel
one
ear
stands
up
and
the
other
hangs
down
and
he
has
a
wink
in
one
eye
even
a
poor
little
bank
swallow
knows
that
where
one
of
dogs
lives
the
bird
people
need
not
fear
either
cats
or
rats
i
love
dogs
said
the
downy
woodpecker
running
up
a
telegraph
pole
in
search
of
grubs
dogs
have
bones
to
eat
and
i
like
to
pick
bones
especially
in
winter
me
too
chimed
in
the
nuthatch
who
walks
chiefly
head
down
and
wears
a
fashionable
white
vest
and
black
necktie
with
a
gray
coat
and
sometimes
they
leave
bits
of
fat
about
yes
dogs
are
very
friendly
things
indeed
then
a
joyful
murmur
ran
all
along
the
wires
and
farmer
griggs
who
was
driving
past
said
to
himself
powerful
lot
of
on
should
think
them
swallers
would
get
and
but
it
was
only
the
birds
whispering
together
agreeing
to
return
to
their
old
haunts
at
orchard
farm
and
give
the
house
children
a
chance
to
learn
that
there
are
no
such
things
as
common
birds
chapter
ii
the
doctor
wonder
room
nathaniel
and
theodora
who
were
called
nat
and
dodo
for
short
were
standing
in
the
hallway
outside
hunter
door
engaged
in
a
very
lively
argument
i
say
birds
are
animals
blustered
nat
pounding
his
fists
together
after
a
fashion
of
his
own
and
i
as
sure
as
anything
that
they
be
persisted
dodo
because
they
have
feathers
and
nothing
else
has
that
does
prove
anything
everything
that
lives
and
grows
is
either
an
animal
or
a
vegetable
do
you
think
that
birds
grow
like
potatoes
and
are
dug
out
of
the
ground
or
come
off
trees
like
apples
and
nat
gave
himself
an
air
of
great
wisdom
such
as
brothers
are
apt
to
wear
when
they
are
in
the
fifth
reader
and
their
sisters
are
only
in
the
third
but
is
there
anything
besides
animals
and
vegetables
that
they
might
be
perhaps
they
are
minerals
said
dodo
brightening
up
as
she
thought
of
the
word
oh
oh
what
a
stupid
you
are
dodo
minerals
why
those
are
rocks
and
such
things
that
ca
move
and
do
live
nat
laughed
rather
rudely
and
putting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
began
to
whistle
i
think
you
might
tell
me
kind
of
an
animal
a
bird
is
and
why
it
has
feathers
and
can
fly
instead
of
laughing
said
dodo
in
a
shaky
voice
for
her
feelings
were
very
tender
and
she
remembered
too
late
what
minerals
are
yes
tell
her
nat
said
olive
who
came
through
the
hall
just
then
are
you
holding
your
knowledge
tight
in
your
pockets
or
whistling
to
keep
from
telling
it
nat
scowled
a
minute
and
then
said
frankly
for
every
one
was
frank
with
olive
i
really
do
know
what
sort
of
an
animal
a
bird
is
though
sure
it
an
animal
do
you
think
uncle
roy
will
tell
us
i
sure
he
will
be
glad
to
if
he
is
not
very
busy
and
he
is
seldom
too
busy
to
talk
of
birds
he
is
writing
a
book
now
of
all
the
things
he
knows
about
them
knock
on
the
door
dodo
i
afraid
to
said
dodo
clasping
her
hands
behind
her
mammy
says
that
room
is
of
birds
and
that
we
must
never
go
in
there
suppose
when
the
door
opens
they
should
get
out
and
fly
away
mammy
was
right
in
telling
you
not
to
go
in
without
asking
because
there
are
a
great
many
books
and
papers
there
that
father
values
and
you
might
upset
them
but
the
birds
that
are
there
are
not
alive
they
are
dead
birds
that
father
has
collected
from
all
parts
of
america
stuffed
birds
such
as
you
have
seen
in
the
glass
cases
in
the
museum
but
cousin
olive
said
nat
in
astonishment
if
uncle
roy
has
shot
enough
birds
to
fill
a
big
room
why
wo
he
let
me
pop
at
a
few
with
my
shooter
you
must
ask
him
why
yourself
nat
knock
again
dodo
father
may
we
come
in
the
children
are
here
with
pockets
full
of
questions
and
olive
opened
the
door
of
the
study
which
dodo
named
the
wonder
room
that
very
day
it
was
a
very
long
room
on
the
southwest
side
of
the
house
the
sun
streamed
in
through
three
wide
windows
and
at
one
end
there
was
a
deep
fireplace
with
brass
andirons
upon
which
some
logs
smouldered
for
though
it
was
a
mild
may
day
the
great
room
felt
cool
around
the
room
were
deep
cases
with
glass
doors
from
which
peeped
all
kinds
and
sizes
of
birds
while
between
the
tops
of
the
cases
and
the
ceiling
the
spaces
were
filled
by
colored
bird
pictures
the
doctor
desk
stood
in
front
of
one
window
heaped
with
papers
and
books
down
the
middle
of
the
room
were
low
standing
back
to
back
and
where
these
ended
before
the
hearth
was
a
settle
almost
as
long
as
a
bed
the
children
stood
still
for
a
minute
speechless
with
surprise
and
delight
then
dodo
made
a
rush
for
the
doctor
chair
and
hugging
him
round
the
neck
cried
dear
uncle
roy
will
you
please
let
us
stay
in
here
a
little
while
so
that
we
can
learn
what
sort
of
animals
birds
are
and
all
about
them
and
will
you
tell
nat
why
you
let
yourself
shoot
birds
when
you
wo
let
him
here
dodo
stopped
both
for
lack
of
breath
and
because
she
knew
that
her
sentences
were
mixing
themselves
dreadfully
so
you
have
been
here
two
whole
days
without
finding
me
out
said
the
doctor
seating
dodo
comfortably
on
his
knee
are
you
afraid
of
the
old
ogre
who
keeps
so
many
birds
prisoners
in
his
den
and
bewitches
them
so
that
they
sit
quite
still
and
never
even
try
to
fly
you
want
to
know
about
birds
do
you
miss
dodo
and
nat
feels
grieved
because
i
wo
let
him
pop
at
our
feathered
neighbors
that
live
in
the
orchard
oh
yes
my
boy
i
know
all
about
it
you
see
cousin
olive
has
been
telling
tales
come
round
here
where
i
can
see
you
i
can
answer
your
question
more
easily
than
i
can
dodo
do
look
ashamed
for
it
is
perfectly
natural
that
you
should
like
to
pop
at
birds
until
you
learn
to
understand
the
reasons
why
you
should
not
it
was
because
you
two
youngsters
have
seen
so
little
of
nature
and
the
things
that
creep
and
crawl
and
fly
that
i
begged
you
from
your
parents
for
a
time
house
people
are
apt
to
grow
selfish
and
cruel
thinking
they
are
the
only
people
upon
the
earth
unless
they
can
sometimes
visit
the
homes
of
the
beast
and
bird
brotherhood
and
see
that
these
can
also
love
and
suffer
and
work
like
themselves
now
my
boy
before
we
begin
to
learn
about
the
birds
i
will
partly
answer
your
question
and
you
will
be
able
to
answer
it
yourself
before
summer
is
over
animal
life
should
never
be
taken
except
for
some
good
purpose
birds
are
killed
by
scientists
that
their
structure
and
uses
may
be
studied
just
as
doctors
must
examine
human
bodies
but
if
you
kill
a
bird
of
what
use
is
its
dead
body
to
you
i
would
like
to
see
if
i
could
hit
it
and
then
i
guess
hesitating
i
could
find
out
its
name
better
if
i
had
it
in
my
hand
ah
nat
my
lad
i
thought
so
to
see
if
you
can
hit
it
and
because
you
want
to
know
the
bird
name
did
you
ever
think
of
trying
to
cut
off
one
of
your
fingers
with
your
to
see
if
you
could
do
it
or
how
it
is
made
why
no
uncle
it
would
hurt
and
i
could
put
it
on
again
and
it
would
do
me
any
good
anyway
for
i
could
find
out
about
it
by
asking
a
doctor
without
hurting
myself
yes
that
is
right
and
for
the
present
you
can
learn
enough
about
birds
without
shooting
them
yourself
and
if
you
learn
your
lesson
well
you
will
never
shoot
a
may
we
see
the
book
you
are
writing
uncle
roy
and
learn
all
about
the
birds
out
of
it
it
is
written
in
words
too
long
and
difficult
for
you
to
understand
here
is
a
page
on
the
desk
see
if
you
can
read
it
nat
stood
by
the
doctor
chair
but
the
longer
he
looked
at
the
page
the
more
puzzled
he
became
and
at
last
he
said
i
think
if
you
please
i
rather
have
a
book
with
only
the
birds
plain
american
names
then
he
spelled
out
slowly
why
that
latin
but
it
only
means
blue
jay
could
you
write
a
book
for
us
uncle
just
a
common
little
book
all
in
plain
words
pleaded
dodo
there
plenty
of
paper
here
and
of
course
the
is
all
in
your
head
because
olive
says
you
know
about
every
bird
that
lives
in
our
america
and
then
you
need
not
put
them
quite
all
in
our
book
bless
your
innocent
heart
how
many
different
kinds
of
birds
do
you
think
there
are
in
america
my
little
yankee
more
than
a
hundred
i
guess
said
dodo
after
a
long
pause
nearly
a
thousand
my
lady
a
thousand
i
think
we
could
remember
so
many
does
olive
know
about
a
thousand
no
nor
about
a
quarter
of
them
dodo
there
are
a
great
many
birds
that
are
rare
or
curious
but
are
not
very
interesting
to
people
like
you
and
me
said
olive
suppose
you
make
us
a
little
book
about
some
of
the
very
nicest
american
birds
put
in
nat
who
had
been
looking
at
the
row
of
stuffed
birds
in
one
of
the
cases
and
began
to
feel
a
real
interest
in
knowing
their
names
and
something
about
them
oh
uncle
roy
here
a
robin
see
dodo
see
i
knew
it
in
a
minute
it
like
meeting
a
fellow
you
know
and
nat
pranced
about
while
the
doctor
laughed
as
if
he
was
well
pleased
now
children
said
he
i
have
an
hour
more
work
this
morning
and
then
we
will
talk
over
this
bird
matter
here
is
a
little
blank
book
and
a
pencil
for
each
of
you
go
down
in
the
orchard
and
when
you
find
a
bird
write
in
the
book
how
it
looks
to
you
so
size
color
of
head
throat
breast
back
tail
and
wings
that
will
be
enough
for
once
but
try
to
remember
also
how
it
sings
you
had
better
help
them
a
bit
to
begin
with
daughter
he
continued
turning
to
olive
who
went
as
gladly
as
if
she
were
only
ten
years
old
like
nat
instead
of
being
seventeen
and
nearly
as
tall
as
her
father
with
skirts
that
covered
her
boot
tops
chapter
iii
a
sparrow
settles
the
question
the
apple
trees
were
not
yet
in
bloom
in
the
orchard
but
the
cherries
were
tricked
out
in
dazzling
white
and
the
peaches
were
blushing
as
prettily
as
possible
on
either
side
of
the
walk
that
led
down
through
the
garden
hyacinths
great
mats
of
single
white
violets
and
bunches
of
yellow
daffies
were
in
flower
and
as
far
as
the
children
could
see
the
fresh
green
orchard
grass
was
gilded
with
dandelions
is
it
lovely
cried
dodo
i
want
to
pick
everything
she
began
to
fill
her
hands
with
dandelions
only
i
wish
that
mother
was
here
and
a
little
quaver
shook
the
merry
voice
she
will
come
by
and
by
dear
said
olive
you
know
your
father
had
to
go
away
on
business
and
you
would
like
him
to
go
all
alone
why
do
people
have
business
to
earn
money
to
be
sure
to
buy
your
pretty
frocks
and
shoes
and
give
you
plenty
to
eat
but
house
people
are
the
only
ones
who
must
work
for
what
they
have
everything
else
takes
what
it
wants
there
is
where
you
are
very
much
mistaken
miss
dodo
everything
works
for
its
living
in
some
way
take
for
example
the
birds
that
you
are
going
to
study
they
have
to
build
their
own
houses
and
feed
their
children
and
travel
about
every
year
on
their
own
particular
business
travel
do
birds
travel
cried
both
children
in
the
same
breath
oh
where
do
they
go
and
what
for
father
will
tell
you
about
that
now
you
must
do
what
he
said
each
find
a
bird
and
see
if
you
can
describe
it
suppose
we
sit
on
this
great
root
it
belongs
to
the
oldest
tree
in
the
orchard
and
grandmother
hunter
used
to
play
house
up
in
the
top
of
it
when
she
was
a
little
girl
father
told
me
he
had
a
perch
up
there
when
he
was
a
boy
so
that
he
could
watch
the
birds
perhaps
if
you
are
careful
and
really
want
to
keep
quiet
and
see
the
birds
he
will
have
one
fixed
for
you
how
jolly
said
nat
i
see
a
bird
now
such
a
queer
little
thing
it
running
round
like
a
mouse
oh
oh
it
goes
just
as
well
upside
down
as
any
other
way
and
nat
pulled
out
his
pencil
and
book
and
waited
for
the
bird
to
come
in
sight
again
which
it
was
kind
enough
to
do
very
soon
size
wrote
nat
struggling
with
his
pencil
which
would
squeak
because
he
had
foolishly
put
it
in
his
mouth
how
big
would
you
call
it
little
said
dodo
promptly
kind
of
little
but
not
so
very
i
seen
smaller
in
the
museum
said
nat
what
would
you
call
it
olive
i
should
call
it
rather
a
small
bird
if
i
were
not
speaking
exactly
but
if
you
wish
to
be
more
particular
you
must
try
to
guess
its
length
in
inches
when
i
was
about
your
age
father
measured
my
middle
finger
and
told
me
it
was
three
inches
long
then
he
made
two
marks
across
it
with
violet
ink
which
takes
a
long
time
to
wash
off
so
that
my
finger
made
a
measure
i
soon
grew
accustomed
to
look
at
a
bird
and
then
at
my
finger
from
nail
to
knuckle
and
then
try
to
tell
how
many
times
longer
the
bird
was
from
the
point
of
his
beak
down
over
his
back
to
the
tip
of
his
tail
of
course
i
made
a
great
many
mistakes
and
could
seldom
tell
exactly
but
it
was
a
great
help
how
long
is
my
finger
asked
nat
eagerly
spreading
out
a
rather
large
hand
for
a
boy
of
ten
about
four
inches
then
that
bird
is
quite
a
little
longer
than
that
five
or
six
inches
anyway
and
he
wrote
length
five
or
six
inches
ah
he
has
gone
wailed
dodo
oh
no
he
has
he
has
come
round
the
tree
again
he
says
squank
as
if
his
voice
was
rusty
is
that
his
song
cousin
olive
no
he
is
only
talking
now
talking
it
seems
to
me
that
birds
can
do
ever
so
many
more
things
than
i
thought
they
possibly
could
black
head
said
nat
as
he
continued
writing
sort
of
gray
on
top
and
white
in
front
his
tail
is
black
and
white
and
rusty
looking
underneath
and
there
he
has
flown
away
do
you
think
that
will
do
and
will
uncle
know
his
name
oh
i
forgot
he
says
goes
head
down
and
picks
things
out
of
the
tree
bark
yes
that
will
do
for
a
beginning
but
father
will
tell
you
some
simple
names
for
the
different
parts
of
every
bird
so
that
your
descriptions
need
not
confuse
you
if
every
one
gave
his
own
names
no
two
people
would
quite
understand
each
other
oh
i
see
a
bird
whispered
dodo
pointing
to
the
grass
at
a
little
distance
see
it
quite
as
big
as
a
pigeon
and
speckled
all
over
black
and
brown
and
has
a
red
mark
on
the
back
of
its
neck
please
write
it
down
for
me
olive
it
takes
me
so
long
to
write
and
i
have
seen
it
in
front
yet
there
it
turning
round
oh
it
has
a
black
mark
in
front
of
its
neck
like
a
cravat
and
it
speckled
underneath
it
has
flown
a
little
further
off
and
is
walking
up
a
tree
and
it
very
white
on
its
back
where
its
tail
begins
oh
do
hear
it
laugh
nat
and
the
flicker
the
big
woodpecker
with
golden
lining
to
its
wings
for
it
was
he
gave
out
peal
after
peal
of
his
jolly
ca
we
go
in
now
to
ask
uncle
roy
the
names
of
these
birds
and
see
if
he
wo
begin
our
book
this
afternoon
it
is
an
hour
yet
since
we
came
out
come
down
through
the
orchard
i
hear
some
bluebirds
singing
and
perhaps
you
can
see
them
they
are
very
tame
and
often
make
their
nests
in
the
knot
holes
in
these
old
trees
see
olive
said
dodo
what
is
that
down
in
the
grass
by
the
fence
it
is
something
moving
do
you
think
it
can
be
any
sort
of
a
wild
animal
no
it
a
boy
said
nat
i
see
his
head
perhaps
he
has
come
to
catch
some
birds
let
drive
him
away
gently
gently
nat
said
olive
it
is
a
boy
but
you
are
not
sure
that
he
is
doing
any
harm
and
besides
it
was
only
yesterday
that
you
were
vexed
with
me
because
i
would
let
you
pop
at
the
birds
yourself
we
will
ask
him
what
he
is
doing
they
went
through
the
orchard
and
found
a
boy
about
twelve
years
old
lying
in
the
grass
he
had
dark
hair
and
eyes
and
a
face
but
was
very
thin
and
a
rude
crutch
was
lying
beside
him
well
little
boy
said
olive
pleasantly
what
is
your
name
and
what
are
you
doing
here
the
child
looked
frightened
at
first
and
hid
his
face
on
his
arm
but
finally
looked
up
and
said
timidly
my
name
is
rap
and
i
was
watching
the
birds
please
i
did
know
anybody
lived
here
only
cows
and
been
coming
in
most
times
for
two
years
then
they
saw
that
he
had
a
tattered
piece
of
a
book
in
one
hand
which
he
slipped
inside
his
jacket
as
carefully
as
if
it
were
a
great
treasure
watching
them
to
like
them
or
to
catch
them
asked
nat
suspiciously
then
feeling
ashamed
the
next
moment
when
rap
answered
to
like
them
i
never
kill
a
bird
i
sometimes
found
dead
ones
that
have
hit
against
the
telegraph
wires
and
it
makes
you
feel
lumpy
in
your
throat
to
see
how
every
little
feather
lies
so
soft
and
lovely
though
they
never
will
fly
any
more
by
this
time
the
three
were
seated
in
front
of
the
strange
boy
looking
at
him
with
great
interest
what
is
the
book
you
were
reading
when
we
came
up
asked
olive
rap
pulled
it
out
and
laid
it
on
her
lap
saying
i
do
know
its
name
the
beginning
part
that
tells
is
gone
but
it
all
about
birds
here
a
picture
of
a
bluebird
only
it
is
quite
right
somehow
oh
i
do
wish
i
had
all
of
the
book
olive
turned
over
the
leaves
that
looked
familiar
to
her
and
saw
that
it
began
at
page
why
it
is
part
of
the
first
volume
of
of
birds
my
father
has
the
whole
of
this
book
she
said
where
did
you
find
this
bit
the
rag
pedler
that
comes
by
every
fall
lets
me
look
in
his
bags
sometimes
there
are
paper
books
in
them
and
he
gave
me
this
for
nothing
it
was
only
a
piece
why
do
you
ask
your
father
to
buy
you
a
whole
book
instead
of
grubbing
in
said
nat
thoughtlessly
rap
looked
from
one
to
the
other
as
if
in
his
interest
he
had
forgotten
himself
for
a
time
and
then
he
said
quietly
i
have
any
father
i
have
any
mother
said
olive
quickly
putting
her
hand
gently
on
the
thin
brown
one
we
must
be
friends
rap
her
sympathy
soothed
him
immediately
and
his
gentle
nature
instantly
tried
to
comfort
her
by
saying
but
you
said
your
father
owned
the
whole
of
my
book
how
glad
you
must
be
then
they
all
laughed
and
nat
and
dodo
began
telling
about
their
uncle
room
and
all
the
books
and
birds
in
it
and
about
the
book
he
had
promised
to
write
for
them
until
rap
looked
so
bewildered
that
olive
was
obliged
to
explain
things
a
little
more
clearly
to
him
come
home
with
us
cried
nat
and
dodo
each
seizing
him
by
a
hand
and
perhaps
uncle
will
tell
you
all
the
names
we
must
learn
head
throat
wings
and
what
all
the
other
parts
are
rightly
called
and
then
we
can
go
around
together
and
watch
birds
but
as
rap
turned
over
and
scrambled
up
with
the
aid
of
his
crutch
they
saw
that
he
had
only
one
leg
for
the
trouser
of
the
left
leg
was
tied
together
just
below
the
knee
acting
as
if
they
did
not
notice
this
they
led
the
way
to
the
house
going
close
to
the
fence
that
divided
the
orchard
from
the
road
because
there
was
a
little
path
worn
there
what
is
the
whole
of
your
name
asked
dodo
who
could
not
keep
from
asking
questions
stephen
hawley
he
answered
my
mother
is
ann
hawley
who
lives
by
the
mill
and
does
all
the
beautiful
fine
white
washing
for
everybody
hereabouts
do
you
know
her
i
suppose
it
because
you
have
just
come
i
believe
my
mother
could
wash
a
cobweb
if
she
tried
and
not
tear
it
and
a
glow
of
pride
lit
up
his
face
but
you
said
a
little
while
ago
that
your
name
was
rap
everybody
calls
me
rap
because
when
i
go
along
the
road
my
crutch
hits
the
stones
and
says
rap
rap
here
a
dead
bird
said
nat
picking
something
from
under
the
fence
it
a
sparrow
said
rap
and
it
flown
against
the
telegraph
wire
in
the
dark
and
been
killed
we
will
take
it
to
uncle
and
ask
him
to
tell
us
all
about
it
yes
yes
said
dodo
we
will
all
go
and
rap
hopped
off
after
the
other
children
so
quickly
that
olive
had
hard
work
to
keep
up
with
him
this
time
nat
and
dodo
did
not
hesitate
outside
the
study
door
but
gave
a
pound
or
two
and
burst
into
the
room
uncle
roy
uncle
roy
we
have
seen
two
birds
and
written
down
about
them
but
we
did
quite
know
what
to
call
the
front
part
where
the
neck
ends
and
the
stomach
begins
or
the
beginning
of
the
tail
and
olive
says
there
are
right
names
for
all
these
parts
and
we
found
rap
in
the
orchard
and
he
only
has
half
a
book
and
here
a
sparrow
and
we
want
to
know
how
it
made
and
why
birds
can
fly
and
why
here
the
doctor
laughingly
stopped
them
and
turned
to
olive
for
a
clearer
account
of
what
had
taken
place
in
the
orchard
while
rap
stood
gazing
about
the
room
as
if
he
thought
that
heaven
had
suddenly
opened
to
him
now
children
said
the
doctor
as
soon
as
the
youngsters
had
stopped
chattering
i
will
first
you
some
stories
about
the
birds
then
if
you
like
them
i
will
make
them
into
a
little
book
that
other
girls
and
boys
may
read
and
as
the
children
began
to
dance
about
he
continued
but
before
i
tell
you
the
names
and
habits
of
some
of
our
home
birds
you
must
learn
a
few
things
that
are
true
of
all
birds
what
they
are
where
they
belong
among
animals
how
they
are
made
how
they
do
good
and
why
we
should
protect
them
and
the
wonderful
journeys
some
of
them
take
i
will
begin
by
answering
dodo
questions
whether
a
bird
is
an
animal
and
why
it
has
feathers
i
think
a
bird
is
something
like
a
boat
said
rap
eagerly
when
it
flies
its
wings
are
like
sails
in
the
air
and
when
it
swims
its
feet
row
under
the
water
and
the
tail
balances
behind
like
a
rudder
and
the
head
sticks
out
in
front
like
the
bowsprit
you
are
right
my
boy
said
the
doctor
looking
at
him
attentively
and
would
you
also
like
to
know
how
this
beautiful
boat
is
made
if
a
could
plan
a
vessel
that
would
go
through
wind
and
water
as
birds
do
he
would
be
the
wisest
man
in
the
world
but
you
see
rap
a
man
did
plan
any
bird
i
will
go
down
and
ask
your
mother
to
let
you
come
and
hear
the
stories
with
the
other
children
how
would
you
like
that
rap
will
you
will
you
really
let
me
come
oh
i
am
so
glad
i
know
mother
let
me
any
day
but
monday
and
thursday
because
i
have
to
watch
clothes
on
those
days
wash
clothes
said
dodo
in
surprise
no
watch
them
replied
rap
laughing
those
two
days
the
miller
lets
mother
spread
her
things
to
whiten
in
his
big
meadow
and
i
have
to
watch
and
see
that
they
are
not
stolen
or
do
blow
away
is
it
very
stupid
to
sit
there
so
long
oh
no
it
lovely
for
there
are
lots
of
birds
and
things
about
will
be
wednesday
said
the
doctor
come
up
to
orchard
farm
by
nine
rap
and
we
will
begin
our
lessons
with
this
little
sparrow
nat
has
found
and
uncle
cried
dodo
you
must
make
inch
measures
on
our
middle
fingers
with
violet
ink
the
way
you
did
to
olive
when
she
was
little
chapter
iv
the
building
of
a
bird
it
rained
on
wednesday
a
warm
spring
rain
swelling
the
rivers
and
ponds
and
watering
the
newly
planted
garden
but
discouraging
the
birds
in
their
and
disappointing
nat
and
dodo
who
wished
to
have
their
lesson
in
the
orchard
come
in
here
children
said
the
doctor
the
wonder
room
as
dodo
calls
it
is
a
good
place
for
a
talk
about
feathers
and
bones
and
the
rest
of
the
things
birds
are
built
of
i
have
sent
for
rap
too
so
that
the
trio
may
be
complete
feathers
and
bones
for
building
birds
said
nat
what
a
queer
idea
for
a
bird
story
not
a
bird
story
exactly
answered
the
doctor
but
some
things
are
true
of
all
birds
and
you
must
know
them
if
you
wish
to
understand
the
of
any
bird
in
particular
in
a
few
minutes
the
three
children
were
seated
on
the
wide
settle
with
a
cheery
log
fire
to
make
them
forget
the
outside
dampness
quick
the
fidgety
little
sat
by
the
hearth
watching
a
possible
mouse
hole
and
wolf
the
tawny
bernard
chose
the
rug
as
a
comfortable
place
for
finishing
his
morning
toilet
olive
presently
joined
the
group
the
doctor
took
the
dead
sparrow
from
the
table
and
began
to
walk
about
the
room
stopping
now
in
front
of
the
fire
and
then
by
the
window
here
is
a
sparrow
different
from
every
other
kind
of
sparrow
different
indeed
from
any
other
sort
of
bird
in
the
world
else
it
would
not
be
the
particular
sort
of
a
sparrow
called
the
but
there
are
a
good
many
things
that
it
has
in
common
with
all
other
birds
can
you
tell
me
some
of
them
i
know
said
dodo
it
has
a
good
many
feathers
on
it
and
i
guess
all
kinds
of
birds
wear
feathers
except
some
when
they
are
very
little
in
the
nest
quite
right
little
girl
said
the
doctor
every
bird
has
feathers
and
no
other
animal
has
feathers
so
we
say
bird
is
known
by
its
feathers
but
what
do
you
suppose
its
feathers
are
for
to
make
it
look
nice
and
pretty
said
dodo
promptly
to
make
it
lighter
so
it
can
fly
added
nat
to
keep
it
warm
too
i
guess
was
rap
answer
well
you
are
all
three
partly
but
not
quite
right
certainly
the
beauty
of
a
bird
depends
most
on
its
feathers
being
not
even
as
you
may
well
believe
if
you
ever
noticed
a
chicken
mammy
bun
had
plucked
but
nat
how
can
feathers
make
a
bird
lighter
when
every
one
of
them
weighs
something
and
a
bird
has
to
carry
them
all
they
make
a
bird
a
little
heavier
than
it
would
be
without
them
yet
it
is
quite
true
that
no
bird
could
fly
if
you
clipped
its
wings
so
some
of
its
feathers
enable
it
to
fly
the
large
ones
that
grow
on
the
wings
then
too
the
large
ones
that
make
the
tail
help
the
bird
to
fly
by
acting
like
a
rudder
to
steer
with
perhaps
the
small
ones
too
all
over
the
body
are
of
some
help
in
flight
because
they
make
a
bird
smooth
so
that
it
can
cut
through
the
air
more
easily
you
know
they
all
lie
one
way
pointing
backward
from
their
roots
to
their
tips
then
when
rap
said
feathers
keep
a
bird
warm
he
guessed
right
birds
wear
plumage
as
you
do
clothes
and
for
the
same
purpose
to
look
nice
and
keep
warm
but
what
is
uncle
roy
asked
dodo
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
feathers
so
i
was
missy
feathers
are
the
plumage
when
you
take
them
all
together
but
see
here
added
the
doctor
as
he
spread
the
wings
out
and
held
them
where
the
children
could
look
closely
are
the
wings
all
plumage
or
is
there
something
else
of
course
there
something
else
to
wings
said
dodo
meat
and
bones
because
i
eaten
chickens
wings
why
did
you
say
dodo
because
there
has
to
be
something
for
the
feathers
to
stick
into
said
nat
decidedly
you
both
have
very
good
reasons
said
the
doctor
the
plumage
of
the
wings
grows
out
from
the
skin
just
as
feathers
grow
from
any
other
part
of
the
body
only
the
large
ones
are
fastened
to
the
bones
so
that
they
stay
tight
in
their
proper
places
if
they
were
loose
they
would
fly
up
when
the
bird
beats
the
air
with
its
wings
and
get
out
of
order
see
how
smoothly
they
lie
one
over
another
when
the
bird
closes
its
wings
they
come
together
snugly
along
its
sides
but
when
the
wing
is
spread
they
slide
apart
yet
not
too
far
to
form
a
broad
flat
surface
quite
stiff
but
light
and
elastic
by
beating
the
air
with
the
wings
birds
fly
along
it
is
something
like
rowing
a
boat
this
surface
pushes
against
the
air
as
the
flat
blade
of
an
oar
pushes
against
the
water
that
is
why
these
large
stiff
feathers
are
called
the
rowers
when
the
wise
men
talk
latin
among
themselves
they
say
for
means
rowers
but
doctor
said
rap
who
was
looking
sharply
at
the
sparrow
wing
all
the
feathers
are
not
like
that
here
are
a
lot
of
little
ones
in
rows
on
top
of
the
wing
in
front
and
more
like
them
underneath
covering
over
the
roots
of
the
rowing
feathers
have
they
any
name
oh
yes
everything
you
can
see
about
a
bird
has
its
own
name
those
small
feathers
are
called
because
they
cover
over
the
roots
of
the
rowers
those
on
top
are
the
upper
coverts
those
underneath
are
the
under
coverts
or
lining
of
the
wings
now
notice
those
two
pretty
bands
of
color
across
the
sparrow
wing
you
see
one
band
is
formed
by
the
tips
of
the
longest
coverts
and
the
other
band
by
the
tips
of
the
next
longest
coverts
those
two
rows
of
feathers
are
the
greater
and
middle
coverts
and
all
the
smallest
feathers
next
to
the
front
edge
of
the
wing
are
called
lesser
coverts
now
look
at
the
tail
rap
and
tell
me
what
you
can
find
why
there
is
a
bunch
of
long
stiff
feathers
like
rowers
that
slide
over
each
other
when
you
spread
the
tail
and
a
lot
of
short
feathers
that
hide
the
roots
of
the
long
ones
are
they
rowers
and
coverts
too
a
bird
does
not
row
with
his
tail
he
steers
with
it
as
if
it
were
a
rudder
and
the
long
feathers
are
therefore
called
or
which
is
latin
for
rudders
but
the
short
ones
are
called
coverts
like
those
of
the
wings
upper
and
under
how
funny
said
dodo
for
a
bird
to
have
to
row
himself
and
steer
himself
all
at
once
i
know
i
should
get
mixed
up
if
i
tried
it
with
a
boat
how
do
feathers
grow
uncle
roy
just
like
your
hair
little
girl
said
the
doctor
patting
her
on
the
head
or
your
nails
did
you
ever
notice
the
dots
all
over
the
skin
of
a
chicken
each
dot
is
a
little
hole
in
the
skin
where
a
feather
sprouts
it
grows
in
a
sheath
that
pushes
out
of
the
hole
like
a
plant
coming
up
out
of
the
ground
from
its
root
for
a
while
this
sheath
is
full
of
blood
to
nourish
the
growing
feather
that
is
why
new
feathers
look
dark
and
feel
soft
they
are
called
the
blood
dries
up
when
the
feather
has
unfolded
to
its
full
size
leaving
it
light
and
dry
with
a
horny
part
at
the
root
that
sticks
in
the
hole
where
it
grew
and
a
part
that
makes
up
most
of
the
feather
the
horny
part
becomes
hollow
or
contains
only
a
little
dry
pith
when
it
is
large
enough
as
in
the
case
of
a
rowing
feather
from
a
goose
wing
it
makes
a
quill
pen
to
write
with
but
the
very
tiniest
feather
on
this
sparrow
is
built
up
in
the
same
way
see
here
is
one
continued
the
doctor
as
he
twitched
out
a
feather
from
the
sparrow
back
you
see
the
quill
part
runs
in
the
middle
from
one
end
to
the
other
this
is
called
the
on
each
side
of
it
all
along
except
just
at
the
root
the
parts
grow
they
are
called
the
or
now
look
through
this
magnifying
glass
at
the
web
the
children
looked
in
turn
and
each
exclaimed
in
wonder
at
the
sight
yes
it
is
very
wonderful
the
web
that
looks
so
smooth
to
the
naked
eye
is
made
up
of
a
great
many
small
shafts
called
that
grow
out
of
the
main
shaft
in
rows
every
one
of
these
small
has
its
own
rows
of
still
smaller
shafts
and
these
again
have
little
fringes
along
their
edges
quite
curly
or
like
tiny
hooks
that
catch
hold
of
the
next
row
and
hold
fast
so
the
whole
feather
keeps
its
shape
though
it
seems
so
frail
and
delicate
are
all
feathers
like
this
one
asked
rap
all
are
equally
wonderful
and
equally
beautiful
in
construction
but
there
is
a
good
deal
of
difference
in
the
way
the
webs
hold
together
almost
all
feathers
that
come
to
the
surface
are
smooth
and
firm
and
there
is
not
much
difference
except
in
size
or
shape
or
color
for
example
the
largest
or
of
this
sparrow
is
quite
like
the
one
i
pulled
out
of
its
back
in
texture
only
the
is
smaller
and
not
so
stiff
but
near
the
roots
of
these
feathers
you
notice
a
fluffy
part
where
the
webs
do
not
hold
together
firmly
some
feathers
are
as
fluffy
as
that
in
their
whole
length
such
are
called
because
they
are
so
downy
birds
that
run
about
as
soon
as
they
are
hatched
are
always
clothed
in
down
like
little
chickens
before
their
other
feathers
sprout
and
some
birds
like
ducks
wear
a
warm
underclothing
of
down
their
whole
lives
then
again
some
feathers
do
not
have
any
webs
at
all
only
a
slender
shaft
as
fine
as
a
hair
do
feathers
keep
on
growing
all
the
time
like
my
hair
asked
dodo
no
my
dear
they
stop
growing
as
soon
as
they
are
of
the
right
size
and
you
will
find
your
hair
will
do
the
same
when
it
is
long
enough
though
that
wo
be
for
a
good
many
years
yet
little
girl
when
the
blood
that
has
fed
the
growing
feather
is
all
dried
up
the
feather
ceases
to
grow
then
after
a
while
longer
when
it
has
become
ragged
and
worn
it
gets
loose
in
the
skin
and
drops
out
as
i
am
sorry
to
say
some
of
my
hair
is
doing
already
that
is
what
we
call
i
know
about
that
interrupted
nat
it
when
hens
shed
their
feathers
but
i
did
know
that
it
was
moulting
when
people
grow
bald
it
is
very
much
the
same
thing
said
the
doctor
only
we
do
call
it
moulting
when
people
lose
their
hair
but
there
is
this
difference
birds
wear
out
their
feathers
much
faster
than
we
do
our
hair
and
need
a
new
suit
at
least
once
a
year
sometimes
oftener
all
young
birds
get
their
first
new
clothes
when
the
down
is
worn
out
old
birds
generally
moult
as
soon
as
they
have
reared
their
broods
which
in
this
country
is
late
in
summer
or
early
in
the
fall
many
also
moult
again
the
following
spring
when
they
put
on
their
wedding
dress
and
one
of
the
curious
things
about
this
change
of
plumage
is
that
the
new
feathers
often
come
out
quite
unlike
those
that
were
cast
off
so
a
bird
may
differ
much
in
appearance
at
different
seasons
and
ages
in
fact
most
birds
do
the
male
also
differs
in
many
cases
from
the
female
being
more
handsomely
dressed
than
his
mate
i
do
think
that
fair
said
dodo
i
should
like
nat
to
have
nicer
clothes
than
i
wear
but
it
is
best
for
bird
people
replied
the
doctor
that
the
mother
bird
who
has
to
keep
house
and
tend
to
the
little
ones
should
not
be
too
conspicuous
she
is
best
protected
from
enemies
when
her
colors
are
plain
and
especially
when
they
match
the
foliage
in
which
she
sits
on
her
nest
if
her
mate
has
only
himself
to
look
out
for
it
does
not
so
much
matter
how
bright
his
plumage
may
be
the
colors
of
some
birds
are
so
exactly
like
their
surroundings
that
you
might
look
long
before
you
could
find
the
sober
quiet
female
whose
mate
is
flashing
his
gay
plumage
and
singing
his
finest
song
perhaps
for
the
very
purpose
of
attracting
your
attention
away
from
his
home
coloration
is
what
the
wise
men
call
it
what
makes
all
the
different
colors
of
birds
doctor
asked
rap
that
is
a
hard
question
to
answer
it
is
natural
for
birds
to
have
particular
colors
just
as
some
people
have
black
eyes
and
hair
while
others
have
blue
eyes
and
yellow
hair
but
i
can
tell
you
one
thing
about
that
look
at
this
sparrow
all
the
colors
it
shows
are
the
feathers
whose
various
markings
are
due
to
certain
substances
called
which
filter
into
the
feathers
and
there
set
in
various
patterns
the
feathers
are
painted
inside
by
nature
and
the
colors
show
through
you
see
none
of
these
colors
are
shiny
like
polished
metal
but
i
could
show
you
some
birds
whose
plumage
glitters
with
all
the
hues
of
the
rainbow
that
glittering
is
called
it
does
not
depend
upon
any
pigment
in
the
substance
of
the
feathers
but
upon
the
way
the
light
strikes
them
it
is
the
same
with
the
beautiful
tints
we
see
on
a
the
film
of
water
itself
is
colorless
but
it
becomes
iridescent
you
might
divide
all
the
colors
of
birds
into
two
classes
those
that
depend
upon
pigments
in
the
feathers
and
those
that
depend
upon
the
play
of
light
on
the
feathers
that
pretty
hard
to
remember
said
nat
but
i
know
how
a
looks
though
i
never
saw
any
birds
look
that
way
please
show
us
one
i
will
show
you
two
answered
the
doctor
who
then
went
to
his
glass
case
and
took
out
a
wild
pigeon
and
a
hummingbird
look
at
the
shining
tints
on
the
neck
of
this
pigeon
and
see
how
the
throat
of
this
hummingbird
glitters
when
i
turn
it
to
the
light
that
the
prettiest
color
i
ever
saw
said
nat
and
i
can
remember
about
it
now
but
he
added
thinking
of
the
way
he
had
seen
hens
mope
when
they
were
moulting
does
it
hurt
birds
to
lose
their
feathers
uncle
it
is
probably
not
as
comfortable
as
being
nicely
dressed
and
sometimes
they
seem
quite
miserable
especially
if
they
shed
old
feathers
faster
than
new
ones
can
grow
to
replace
the
lost
ones
some
birds
like
ducks
lose
their
all
at
once
and
can
not
fly
for
quite
a
while
but
heart
of
nature
is
kind
to
his
children
as
a
rule
most
birds
shed
their
rowing
feathers
one
at
a
time
in
each
wing
so
that
they
never
lose
their
power
of
flight
now
this
will
do
for
wings
tails
and
feathers
come
what
is
the
next
thing
you
notice
about
this
sparrow
is
it
entirely
covered
with
feathers
of
course
it
is
said
dodo
it
has
any
feathers
on
its
beak
or
on
its
feet
else
how
could
it
eat
and
hop
about
that
is
right
these
parts
of
a
sparrow
are
bare
they
never
have
any
feathers
and
the
skin
on
them
is
hard
and
horny
as
different
from
soft
thin
skin
as
now
look
at
the
beak
and
think
how
many
things
a
sparrow
has
to
do
with
it
he
has
no
hands
or
paws
and
so
he
must
pick
up
everything
he
eats
with
his
beak
he
has
no
teeth
and
so
he
must
bite
his
food
with
his
beak
he
feeds
on
seeds
like
a
canary
bird
so
his
beak
comes
to
a
sharp
point
because
seeds
are
small
things
to
pick
up
and
it
is
very
strong
and
horny
because
seeds
are
hard
to
crack
to
get
at
the
kernel
notice
too
children
that
his
beak
is
in
two
halves
an
upper
half
and
a
lower
half
when
these
halves
are
held
apart
his
mouth
is
open
so
that
you
can
see
the
tongue
inside
and
when
the
two
halves
are
closed
together
the
mouth
is
shut
these
halves
are
called
the
and
the
why
it
just
like
people
mouths
said
nat
only
people
have
lips
and
teeth
certainly
it
is
like
our
mouths
birds
are
built
like
ourselves
in
a
great
many
things
and
live
as
we
do
in
a
great
many
ways
bird
people
and
house
people
are
animals
and
all
animals
must
eat
to
live
a
beak
is
its
mouth
and
the
under
mandible
moves
up
and
down
like
our
chins
when
we
eat
or
talk
birds
can
talk
as
well
as
sing
with
their
beaks
this
sparrow
can
say
and
some
kinds
of
parrots
can
repeat
whole
sentences
so
as
to
be
understood
that
is
another
thing
in
which
birds
beaks
are
like
our
mouths
now
look
again
can
you
see
anything
else
about
the
sparrow
beak
i
see
a
pair
of
little
holes
at
the
root
of
the
upper
mandible
said
rap
well
those
are
the
nostrils
said
the
doctor
birds
must
breathe
like
ourselves
and
when
the
beak
is
shut
they
breathe
through
the
nostrils
so
do
i
said
dodo
and
then
she
pursed
up
her
pretty
red
lips
tightly
breathing
quite
hard
through
her
nose
i
do
think
she
said
when
she
had
finished
this
performance
birds
have
faces
with
all
the
things
in
them
that
we
have
there
are
the
eyes
too
on
each
side
like
people
eyes
only
they
look
sideways
and
not
in
front
but
i
do
see
their
ears
have
birds
any
ears
uncle
roy
i
can
show
you
this
sparrow
ears
see
here
said
the
doctor
who
had
run
the
point
of
his
penknife
under
a
little
package
of
feathers
on
one
side
of
the
back
of
the
sparrow
head
and
lifted
them
up
what
does
that
look
like
it
a
hole
in
the
skin
that
runs
into
the
head
said
nat
can
birds
hear
through
that
of
course
they
can
ears
of
all
animals
are
made
to
hear
with
this
sparrow
can
hear
quite
as
well
as
you
can
nat
now
think
children
how
many
things
we
have
found
about
this
sparrow
head
that
are
quite
like
our
own
ears
eyes
nose
mouth
and
tongue
only
there
are
no
lips
or
teeth
because
the
horny
beak
with
its
hard
edges
and
sharp
point
answers
both
for
lips
and
teeth
i
want
you
to
learn
from
this
how
many
things
are
really
alike
in
bird
people
and
house
people
though
they
look
so
different
at
first
sight
when
we
come
to
the
bird
stories
you
will
find
that
birds
differ
very
much
among
themselves
in
all
these
things
i
will
show
you
all
sorts
of
beaks
of
different
sizes
and
shapes
here
are
pictures
of
several
kinds
of
beaks
see
how
much
they
differ
in
shape
but
they
are
all
beaks
and
all
beaks
are
mouths
they
all
answer
the
same
purposes
in
birds
lives
and
the
purposes
are
the
same
as
those
of
our
mouths
but
now
what
do
you
notice
about
this
sparrow
feet
they
are
not
a
bit
like
my
feet
said
dodo
they
are
so
long
and
slim
and
hard
and
the
toes
stick
out
so
all
around
i
think
mine
are
nicer
but
they
would
not
be
so
useful
as
this
sparrow
if
you
had
to
live
in
a
bush
and
hop
about
on
the
twigs
said
the
doctor
the
bird
feet
are
fixed
as
nicely
for
that
as
yours
are
for
walking
on
the
ground
i
can
show
you
too
little
girl
that
a
sparrow
feet
are
a
great
deal
more
like
yours
than
you
think
come
rap
tell
me
what
you
see
about
this
bird
feet
why
they
are
the
ends
of
its
legs
and
there
is
a
long
slim
part
beyond
the
feathers
hard
and
horny
like
the
beak
and
at
the
end
of
this
are
four
toes
three
in
front
and
one
behind
and
they
all
sharp
claws
on
their
ends
very
well
said
my
boy
now
i
will
show
you
that
such
feet
as
the
sparrow
has
are
as
much
like
dodo
as
a
sparrow
beak
is
like
her
mouth
begin
with
the
claws

i
know
exclaimed
dodo
only
i
think
they
need
cutting
of
course
they
are
said
the
doctor
do
nails
grow
on
the
ends
of
toes
all
kinds
of
claws
on
the
ends
of
birds
and
other
animals
toes
are
the
same
as
nails
some
are
long
sharp
and
curved
like
a
cat
or
a
sparrow
and
some
are
flat
and
blunt
like
ours
i
could
show
you
some
birds
with
claws
that
look
just
like
our
toes
too
are
pretty
much
the
same
only
this
sparrow
like
most
other
birds
has
but
four
with
three
of
them
in
a
line
in
front
and
the
other
one
pointing
backward
that
is
what
makes
its
foot
as
good
as
a
hand
to
hold
on
with
when
it
perches
on
slender
twigs
almost
all
birds
have
their
toes
fixed
that
way
some
that
do
not
perch
have
no
hind
toe
and
birds
that
swim
have
broad
webs
stretched
between
their
front
toes
like
ducks
all
the
different
kinds
of
feet
birds
have
are
fitted
for
the
ways
they
move
about
on
the
ground
or
water
or
among
the
branches
of
trees
and
bushes
just
as
all
their
shapes
of
beaks
are
fitted
for
the
kind
of
food
they
eat
and
the
way
they
pick
it
up
here
are
two
pictures
that
will
show
you
several
different
kinds
of
feet
now
you
must
answer
the
next
question
nat
what
do
toes
grow
on
feet
said
nat
promptly
then
adding
but
this
sparrow
has
any
feet
except
its
toes
they
grow
on
its
legs
because
the
rest
of
the
horny
part
stands
up
i
noticed
that
in
canaries
but
all
this
horny
part
is
the
foot
not
the
leg
answered
the
doctor
though
it
does
stand
up
as
you
say
how
could
toes
grow
from
legs
without
any
feet
between
they
never
do
there
has
to
be
a
foot
in
every
animal
between
the
toes
and
the
legs
now
what
do
you
call
the
end
of
your
foot
which
is
opposite
the
end
on
which
the
toes
grow

it
the

in

but
i
should
think
the
hind
toe
of
a
bird
was
its
heel
said
nat
doubtfully
and
beginning
to
think
he
did
not
understand
you
might
think
so
said
the
doctor
but
you
would
be
wrong
all
this
horny
part
that
a
bird
stands
up
on
is
its
foot
and
the
top
of
it
nearest
to
the
feathers
is
the
heel
do
you
see
when
i
bend
the
foot
continued
the
doctor
as
he
bent
the
sparrow
foot
forward
that
the
top
of
the
horny
part
makes
a
joint
that
stands
out
backward
in
the
same
position
your
heel
always
has
all
this
slender
horny
part
of
the
foot
above
the
roots
of
the
toes
corresponds
to
the
instep
of
your
foot
and
of
course
the
heel
comes
next
you
must
remember
the
name
of
it
the
wise
men
call
it
the
then
has
a
bird
got
any
legs
uncle
roy
only
just
feet
asked
dodo
oh
yes
legs
too
with
a
and
a
like
ours
but
all
these
parts
are
up
closer
to
the
body
and
hidden
by
the
feathers
so
that
you
can
not
see
them
as
the
doctor
said
this
there
was
a
great
commotion
quick
who
had
been
watching
the
mouse
hole
all
the
while
gave
a
sharp
bark
and
pounced
on
something
there
was
a
feeble
squeak
and
it
was
all
over
with
a
mouse
which
had
ventured
too
far
from
its
hole
poor
little
mousey
said
the
doctor
as
he
took
the
limp
body
from
the
terrier
mouth
it
is
quite
dead
i
am
sorry
but
it
might
have
nibbled
some
of
my
birds
besides
this
is
exactly
what
i
wanted
to
teach
you
something
about
who
can
tell
me
the
difference
between
a
mouse
and
a
sparrow
i
can
said
dodo
it
all
difference
a
mouse
has
any
feathers
or
any
wings
and
it
has
four
feet
and
a
long
tail
and
whiskers
and
teeth
that
will
do
little
girl
for
differences
do
you
see
anything
alike
between
a
sparrow
and
a
mouse
rap
i
think
the
fur
is
something
like
feathers
doctor
answered
rap
and
you
told
us
how
a
beak
was
like
a
mouth
without
any
teeth
or
lips
then
a
mouse
has
four
feet
and
legs
but
a
bird
has
only
two
feet
and
two
wings
instead
of
four
legs
and
feet
like
a
mouse
that
is
just
what
i
want
you
all
to
think
about
said
the
doctor
now
listen
if
a
sparrow
has
a
pair
of
feet
that
correspond
to
a
hind
feet
what
do
you
think
a
sparrow
wings
correspond
to
in
a
mouse
i
should
think
they
would
be
something
like
a
mouse
fore
feet
answered
rap
after
thinking
a
moment
that
is
exactly
right
birds
and
beasts
are
alike
in
many
respects
they
have
heads
necks
and
bodies
they
have
tails
and
they
have
limbs
beasts
have
two
pairs
of
limbs
we
call
them
fore
legs
and
hind
legs
people
have
two
pairs
also
we
call
them
arms
and
legs
so
you
see
our
arms
correspond
to
the
fore
legs
of
beasts
though
we
never
use
them
for
moving
about
except
when
we
go
on
our
hands
and
knees
or
climb
trees
or
swim
in
the
water
and
as
for
birds
why
their
fore
limbs
are
turned
into
wings
to
fly
with
so
that
they
walk
or
hop
on
their
hind
limbs
only
just
as
we
do
animals
that
go
on
all
fours
are
called
animals
that
go
on
their
two
hind
limbs
only
like
bird
people
and
house
people
are
called
a
sparrow
wings
are
just
as
much
like
a
mouse
fore
legs
as
a
sparrow
feathers
are
like
a
mouse
fur
how
funny
said
dodo
but
how
are
a
bird
wings
like
fore
legs
when
they
have
got
any
paws
or
toes
or
fingers
or
claws
only
just
long
feathers
they
have
fingers
and
some
birds
wings
have
claws
only
you
can
not
see
them
because
they
are
all
wrapped
up
in
the
skin
and
covered
over
with
the
feathers
some
day
not
because
you
have
had
a
long
lesson
already
i
will
show
you
a
bird
wing
with
only
its
bones
then
you
will
see
that
it
has
at
the
end
then
next
then
bones
that
run
from
the
wrist
to
the
elbow
and
then
one
bone
that
runs
from
the
elbow
to
the
shoulder
almost
the
same
bones
that
people
have
in
their
fingers
hands
wrists
and
arms
so
you
see
wings
are
the
same
to
a
bird
that
fore
legs
are
to
a
mouse
or
arms
are
to
us
i
could
go
through
all
the
inside
parts
of
birds
and
show
you
something
like
the
same
parts
in
people
stomach
and
bowels
to
take
care
of
the
food
they
eat
and
turn
it
into
blood
to
nourish
them
lungs
to
breathe
with
and
keep
the
blood
pure
heart
to
beat
and
thus
pump
the
warm
blood
into
all
parts
of
the
body
brain
and
nerves
which
are
what
birds
think
and
feel
with
just
as
we
do
with
ours
and
all
their
bones
which
together
make
what
we
call
the
or
framework
of
the
body
to
keep
the
flesh
in
shape
and
support
the
other
organs
dear
me
sighed
dodo
there
must
be
ever
so
many
more
things
inside
of
birds
that
we
ca
see
than
there
are
outside
of
course
there
are
said
the
doctor
it
wo
be
very
hard
for
you
to
remember
the
outside
parts
and
learn
the
names
of
them
all
i
have
told
you
most
of
them
that
you
need
to
remember
to
understand
the
stories
i
am
going
to
tell
you
about
birds
see
here
what
do
you
think
of
this
illustration
outside
parts
of
a
bird
so
saying
the
doctor
unrolled
a
large
sheet
of
that
hung
on
the
wall
here
is
a
picture
of
the
sparrow
drawn
so
big
you
can
see
it
almost
across
the
room
with
all
the
outside
parts
of
which
you
must
learn
the
names
you
see
the
names
are
all
on
the
picture
too
i
am
going
to
make
it
smaller
and
put
it
in
the
book
i
will
write
for
you
so
you
can
look
at
it
whenever
you
wish
it
is
almost
now
and
you
must
be
very
hungry
but
now
i
must
tell
you
one
thing
more
you
know
there
are
so
many
many
different
kinds
of
birds
and
other
animals
that
nobody
could
remember
them
unless
they
were
classified
to
classify
is
to
put
things
that
are
most
alike
closest
together
then
next
nearest
them
things
that
are
next
most
alike
and
to
keep
furthest
apart
those
things
that
are
least
alike
now
it
is
true
that
all
beasts
birds
snakes
lizards
frogs
and
fishes
have
some
things
alike
though
each
has
some
other
things
different
from
all
the
rest
if
they
were
not
all
alike
in
some
things
we
could
not
call
them
all
animals
one
of
the
things
in
which
all
the
animals
i
have
named
are
alike
is
that
they
all
have
skeletons
one
of
the
things
in
which
all
their
skeletons
are
alike
is
that
they
have
backbones
backbones
are
the
chains
of
bones
that
run
along
the
back
from
the
head
to
the
tail
backbones
are
called
by
the
wise
men
animals
that
have
backbones
are
named
and
animals
that
lack
backbones
are
named
tell
us
the
names
of
some
invertebrates
please
doctor
said
rap
well
all
sorts
of
insects
are
invertebrates
and
so
are
lobsters
and
crabs
oysters
and
clams
worms
starfishes
corals
and
even
sponges
then
there
are
some
too
small
to
see
without
a
microscope
but
never
mind
about
invertebrates
now
i
only
want
you
to
remember
that
all
beasts
birds
reptiles
and
fishes
are
vertebrates
and
that
there
are
five
principal
classes
of
them
if
i
should
tell
you
as
much
about
them
as
i
have
about
the
building
of
a
bird
you
would
see
that
they
are
all
built
on
what
we
call
the
vertebrate
plan
of
structure
here
is
a
chart
of
the
classes
of
vertebrates
you
can
study
it
this
afternoon
till
you
learn
it
by
heart
vertebrates
with
class
i
animals
which
have
fur
or
hair
bring
forth
their
young
alive
and
nurse
them
house
people
are
mammals
class
ii
animals
which
have
feathers
and
lay
eggs
class
iii
animals
which
have
scaly
skins
like
lizards
snakes
and
turtles
class
iv
animals
which
have
naked
skins
like
frogs
toads
and
newts
all
the
foregoing
classes
except
a
few
of
the
batrachians
breathe
air
in
lungs
and
almost
all
except
snakes
have
legs
none
now
living
can
fly
except
bats
and
birds
but
bats
are
mammals
class
v
animals
which
have
either
scaly
or
naked
skins
but
no
fur
or
feathers
which
live
in
the
water
breathe
it
with
their
gills
and
swim
in
it
with
fins
chapter
v
citizen
bird
the
apple
trees
were
in
full
bloom
the
day
that
the
doctor
again
found
time
to
be
with
the
children
it
was
exactly
the
kind
of
a
day
that
birds
like
the
ground
was
soft
enough
to
let
the
earthworms
come
up
to
breathe
so
that
robins
could
catch
them
easily
and
the
air
was
full
of
all
kinds
of
insects
newly
out
from
their
long
winter
sleep
in
their
soft
cocoon
beds
much
to
the
delight
of
the
swallows
and
flycatchers
it
was
also
a
beautiful
day
for
house
people
to
watch
their
bird
neighbors
for
it
was
mild
but
not
too
bright
and
every
one
knows
how
it
hurts
the
eyes
to
look
at
flying
birds
with
the
sun
shining
in
them
olive
dodo
and
nat
went
out
first
and
found
rap
waiting
the
doctor
followed
carrying
something
in
his
hand
in
a
black
leather
case
when
they
arrived
at
the
old
tree
in
the
orchard
he
told
them
to
look
up
there
was
the
perch
arranged
as
it
had
been
when
he
was
a
boy
not
a
perch
for
birds
but
for
house
people
narrow
board
seats
fitted
in
between
the
largest
branches
and
a
bar
fastened
across
some
of
the
highest
ones
so
that
it
was
quite
safe
to
climb
up
and
look
out
of
the
top
of
the
tree
the
branches
had
been
trimmed
away
here
and
there
so
that
a
good
view
could
be
had
of
what
was
happening
elsewhere
in
the
orchard
a
scream
of
surprise
and
delight
came
from
the
group
in
which
olive
joined
quickly
as
the
children
scrambled
into
the
tree
the
doctor
was
up
there
first
laughing
and
saying
that
it
was
thirty
years
since
he
had
climbed
that
apple
tree
for
after
he
went
away
to
college
the
old
seats
had
decayed
and
fallen
down
give
me
your
hand
and
i
help
you
up
called
nat
to
rap
who
had
dropped
his
crutch
and
was
looking
up
at
the
others
no
you
need
said
rap
i
can
climb
all
right
sometimes
it
so
handy
for
me
but
other
times
it
easier
for
in
tight
places
one
leg
does
take
up
as
much
room
as
two
and
he
swung
and
pushed
until
he
was
up
as
high
as
the
rest
here
a
nest
with
eggs
in
it
whispered
dodo
who
had
crept
out
on
a
limb
where
a
rather
large
round
nest
made
of
grass
and
little
sticks
plastered
together
with
mud
was
saddled
on
the
branch
in
fact
a
robin
nest
four
lovely
smooth
eggs
not
quite
blue
and
not
quite
green
please
can
i
have
them
i
saw
them
first
think
a
minute
dodo
said
the
doctor
a
bird
will
come
from
each
of
those
eggs
suppose
you
take
the
eggs
away
from
the
poor
robins
you
will
be
killing
four
young
birds
besides
hurting
the
feelings
of
their
parents
and
making
them
leave
the
orchard
very
likely
you
must
not
take
any
eggs
in
the
nesting
season
not
even
one
i
will
tell
you
what
happened
once
in
a
field
where
there
were
some
birds
nests
in
the
bushes
the
man
who
owned
the
field
was
fond
of
birds
and
wished
to
protect
them
but
he
was
so
that
when
his
little
boy
came
to
him
and
said
wish
so
much
to
have
some
birds
eggs
all
the
boys
collect
them
let
me
take
a
few
father
only
on
our
own
land
he
did
not
wish
to
say
sometimes
to
be
is
as
bad
as
to
be
cruel
this
man
said
may
take
one
egg
from
each
nest
but
only
remember
so
the
boy
went
out
and
took
a
few
eggs
but
then
he
carried
them
to
school
showed
them
to
the
other
boys
and
told
them
where
they
came
from
then
each
boy
said
to
himself
will
be
all
right
if
i
take
only
one
egg
from
each
nest
but
when
four
or
five
boys
had
each
taken
one
all
the
nests
were
quite
empty
so
the
poor
birds
left
that
man
field
where
the
bugs
and
worms
grew
and
throve
till
they
ate
up
his
hay
and
all
the
rest
of
his
crops
when
the
nesting
season
is
over
eggs
that
have
not
hatched
are
often
left
in
the
various
nests
that
you
can
take
without
doing
any
harm
of
course
i
know
it
is
not
easy
to
keep
your
hands
off
such
pretty
things
as
birds
eggs
but
if
by
doing
so
you
can
be
patriotic
and
useful
it
is
an
act
of
that
you
will
be
glad
to
do
for
the
good
of
the
country
what
is
in
that
black
case
uncle
asked
dodo
is
it
a
pistol
to
shoot
birds
i
think
it
looks
too
fat
for
that
not
the
kind
of
a
pistol
that
you
mean
dodo
but
the
only
kind
that
you
youngsters
need
to
bring
down
birds
so
that
you
can
see
them
it
is
a
gun
but
you
must
use
your
eyes
for
bullets
instead
of
leaden
balls
see
and
he
took
a
fine
pair
of
from
the
case
moved
the
screw
a
little
and
held
them
before
eyes
what
do
you
see
down
there
in
the
grass
why
it
a
robin
but
how
big
it
looks
every
feather
shows
by
itself
and
it
has
white
rings
round
its
eyes
like
spectacles
i
never
saw
them
before
i
sure
then
as
the
doctor
handed
the
glasses
to
nat
dodo
looked
in
her
lap
expecting
to
find
the
bird
there
instead
of
a
hundred
feet
away
this
is
jolly
cried
nat
taking
a
peep
and
passing
the
glasses
to
rap
who
put
them
to
his
eyes
gave
a
little
ah
and
looked
through
them
until
the
doctor
said
that
will
do
now
olive
shall
keep
the
glasses
and
whenever
you
children
want
them
she
will
give
them
to
you
but
you
must
be
careful
never
to
scratch
them
or
rub
your
fingers
over
the
lenses
at
either
end
with
this
magnifying
instrument
you
will
be
able
to
see
the
shape
of
beaks
and
wings
and
many
color
markings
you
would
never
notice
otherwise
but
what
did
i
promise
to
tell
you
of
children
citizen
bird
you
said
replied
nat
though
i
do
think
i
quite
know
what
you
mean
what
does
mean
asked
the
doctor
smiling
i
think
it
is
a
person
who
lives
in
a
city
but
birds
are
people
and
they
do
live
much
in
the
city
you
are
right
in
one
sense
my
boy
but
the
word
has
also
a
far
wider
meaning
do
you
know
what
it
is
olive
but
olive
was
not
sure
and
the
doctor
asked
her
to
go
to
his
study
and
look
for
the
word
in
the
big
dictionary
in
a
few
minutes
she
returned
with
a
slip
of
paper
from
which
her
father
read
citizen
a
member
of
a
nation
especially
of
a
republic
one
who
owes
allegiance
to
a
government
and
is
entitled
to
protection
from
it
now
if
you
listen
carefully
i
think
i
can
prove
to
you
that
every
bird
you
can
find
is
such
a
citizen
of
this
country
and
show
you
why
we
should
protect
him
i
told
you
the
other
day
how
the
body
of
a
bird
was
planned
and
built
to
fill
a
place
no
other
animal
could
take
thus
by
his
habits
and
character
every
bird
fills
a
place
as
a
citizen
of
our
republic
keeping
the
laws
and
doing
work
for
the
land
that
house
people
with
all
their
wisdom
can
not
do
every
such
of
ours
besides
having
eyes
to
see
with
and
a
brain
which
if
it
does
not
tell
him
as
many
things
as
our
brains
tell
us
yet
teaches
him
all
that
he
need
know
to
follow
the
laws
that
heart
of
nature
has
set
for
him
has
the
same
feelings
and
affections
as
ourselves
parent
birds
love
each
other
and
their
little
ones
and
often
lose
their
lives
in
trying
to
protect
them
they
build
their
homes
with
as
much
care
and
skill
as
house
people
use
in
making
theirs
then
they
work
hard
very
hard
indeed
to
collect
food
to
feed
their
children
for
bird
children
are
oh
so
hungry
they
grow
very
quickly
and
must
eat
constantly
from
morning
until
night
with
them
it
is
breakfast
luncheon
dinner
tea
and
supper
with
a
great
many
other
meals
between
times
that
would
not
be
wholesome
for
house
children
so
you
can
see
for
yourselves
that
we
may
well
call
the
bird
a
yes
said
rap
his
eyes
beaming
as
if
he
had
something
to
tell
some
birds
work
as
hard
as
mother
does
i
watched
a
pair
of
robins
all
one
day
last
spring
when
i
was
sick
they
had
a
nest
in
a
bush
by
our
kitchen
window
where
i
could
see
it
well
and
all
day
long
either
the
mother
or
the
father
came
about
every
two
minutes
with
something
for
the
little
ones
to
eat
i
timed
them
by
the
clock
until
i
was
nearly
dizzy
and
they
seemed
to
do
the
same
thing
every
day
until
the
young
ones
flew
away
then
they
went
over
to
the
grape
vines
made
a
new
nest
and
raised
four
more
the
same
way
and
then
rap
stopped
suddenly
as
if
he
feared
that
he
had
been
talking
too
much
that
is
all
true
said
the
doctor
looking
very
happy
at
finding
that
one
of
his
listeners
not
only
saw
for
himself
but
remembered
and
thought
about
what
he
had
seen
if
you
have
used
your
eyes
so
well
my
lad
when
we
come
to
the
bird
stories
i
shall
expect
you
to
tell
some
of
them
yourself
and
the
doctor
held
out
his
hand
to
the
child
with
a
look
that
sent
him
to
bed
to
dream
happy
dreams
for
many
a
night
the
children
gazed
at
rap
in
surprise
it
was
a
new
idea
that
a
poor
little
fellow
like
him
should
know
more
than
they
who
had
both
parents
and
nice
clothes
and
had
been
to
school
in
a
big
city
that
he
should
be
able
to
tell
stories
about
birds
seemed
wonderful
but
they
were
not
selfish
and
instead
of
being
jealous
felt
a
great
respect
for
rap
now
said
the
doctor
we
will
see
what
a
good
neighbor
to
house
people
a
bird
is
and
how
in
working
for
himself
he
helps
them
also
how
can
birds
possibly
work
to
help
people
asked
dodo
and
nat
together
but
rap
smiled
to
himself
as
if
he
knew
something
about
the
matter
and
said
they
eat
the
bugs
and
worms
and
things
that
kill
the
gardens
and
fields
you
are
right
again
said
the
doctor
heartily
what
is
one
thing
that
man
and
every
other
animal
must
have
to
keep
him
alive
shouted
nat
and
then
grew
very
red
as
the
others
laughed
because
since
he
had
been
at
orchard
farm
his
appetite
had
grown
so
that
though
he
ate
twice
as
much
as
olive
and
dodo
he
seemed
always
hungry
yes
food
bread
meat
vegetables
and
fruits
but
bread
first
of
all
what
is
bread
made
of
wheat
i
think
said
nat
rye
too
mother
is
good
said
rap
do
forget
mammy
bun
added
olive
all
your
answers
are
right
for
many
different
kinds
of
bread
are
used
in
various
parts
of
the
country
but
whether
it
is
made
from
or
or
it
all
grows
from
the
ground
does
it
not
now
the
next
sort
of
food
meat
the
flesh
of
animals
oxen
sheep
pigs
and
poultry
what
do
they
feed
on
oxen
eat
grass
and
hay
and
meal
said
dodo
in
great
haste
lest
some
one
else
should
speak
first
sheep
eat
grass
and
hay
too
i
seen
them
over
in
the
pasture
on
the
hill
said
nat
pigs
will
eat
any
old
sort
of
thing
said
rap
sour
milk
and
snakes
and
swill
and
rats
ugh
shivered
dodo
are
all
those
nasty
things
in
sausages
no
dodo
laughed
the
doctor
when
pigs
are
shut
up
they
eat
a
great
many
dirty
things
but
naturally
they
prefer
clean
food
like
other
cattle
corn
acorns
apples
and
so
forth
besides
those
things
as
you
call
them
turn
into
pork
before
they
are
put
in
sausages
for
pigs
know
how
to
make
pork
so
you
see
that
all
the
food
of
the
animals
whose
flesh
we
eat
comes
out
of
the
ground
and
that
is
what
the
bible
means
where
it
says
flesh
is
grass
but
what
other
things
are
there
that
grow
up
out
of
the
earth
tall
and
strong
each
one
holding
a
beautiful
green
screen
to
keep
the
sun
from
drawing
all
the
moisture
from
the
ground
and
making
it
too
dry
shading
the
rivers
that
their
waters
may
not
waste
away
some
making
cool
bowers
for
house
people
to
sit
under
others
bearing
delicious
fruits
for
them
to
eat
and
all
in
good
time
yielding
their
bodies
to
make
fires
and
give
out
heat
to
warm
us
trees
yes
trees
of
course
cried
the
children
eagerly
all
kinds
of
trees
for
trees
grow
apples
and
pears
and
plums
and
cherries
and
chestnuts
and
firewood
too
now
what
is
there
that
preys
upon
all
this
vegetable
life
upon
every
plant
from
the
grass
to
the
tree
destroying
them
all
equally
bugs
and
worms
and
all
kinds
of
crawlers
and
flyers
and
hoppers
said
rap
yes
every
plant
has
an
insect
enemy
which
feeds
upon
its
life
juices
so
a
set
of
animals
has
been
developed
by
heart
of
nature
to
hold
the
plant
destroyers
in
check
and
these
animals
are
the
birds
man
may
do
all
he
can
to
protect
his
gardens
his
orchards
his
fields
and
forests
but
if
the
birds
did
not
help
him
the
insects
that
work
by
night
and
day
tapping
at
the
root
boring
inside
the
bark
piercing
the
very
heart
of
the
plant
chewing
off
the
under
side
of
leaves
nipping
off
the
buds
would
make
the
earth
bare
and
brown
instead
of
green
and
blooming
yet
house
people
both
young
and
old
forget
this
they
shoot
and
frighten
away
the
birds
either
because
some
few
of
their
feathered
friends
take
grapes
or
other
fruits
and
berries
by
way
of
pay
or
merely
from
thoughtlessness
to
see
how
many
they
can
hit
do
birds
eat
bugs
and
such
things
asked
nat
olive
said
she
used
to
put
out
grain
and
crumbs
in
winter
for
some
kinds
some
birds
eat
animal
food
and
some
seed
food
while
others
eat
both
but
almost
all
birds
feed
their
babies
upon
insects
the
nesting
season
is
chiefly
in
spring
when
all
plants
begin
or
renew
their
growth
spring
is
also
the
season
when
the
eggs
of
many
insects
hatch
out
and
when
others
come
from
the
cocoons
in
which
they
have
slept
all
winter
then
the
farmer
begins
his
annual
war
upon
them
and
day
after
day
he
fights
the
battle
of
the
bugs
but
if
he
stops
to
think
and
remembers
that
heart
of
nature
has
a
use
for
everything
he
will
win
this
battle
against
the
creeping
crawling
squirming
regiments
more
easily
for
above
him
in
the
trees
of
his
forest
in
the
hedgerows
and
bushes
of
his
pasture
and
garden
on
the
rafters
of
his
barn
even
in
the
chimney
of
his
house
live
the
birds
willing
and
eager
to
help
him
and
all
the
wages
they
ask
is
permission
to
work
for
a
living
and
protection
from
those
of
his
fellowmen
who
covet
the
oriole
and
cardinal
for
their
gay
feathers
and
the
robin
and
meadowlark
for
pie
is
wicked
i
would
like
to
pound
them
all
said
dodo
striking
her
fists
together
as
nat
did
sometimes
not
making
it
clear
whether
it
was
pie
or
people
she
wanted
to
pound
but
uncle
it
is
right
to
eat
some
birds
ducks
and
chickens
and
geese
and
turkeys
yes
dodo
they
belong
to
another
class
of
birds
a
lower
order
that
seem
made
for
food
not
singing
nor
helping
the
farmers
but
even
these
should
not
be
shot
needlessly
or
in
their
nesting
season
but
the
higher
order
the
perching
song
birds
should
never
be
shot
except
the
common
sparrow
of
europe
that
we
call
the
english
sparrow
his
habits
are
wholly
bad
he
meddles
with
the
nests
of
useful
birds
and
is
a
nuisance
to
his
human
as
well
as
bird
neighbors
to
prevent
confusion
heart
of
nature
has
divided
the
habits
and
appetites
of
birdland
so
that
instead
of
a
great
many
families
all
building
in
one
kind
of
tree
or
eating
the
same
sort
of
insects
or
seeds
each
has
its
own
manners
and
customs
thus
they
divide
among
themselves
the
realms
of
the
air
the
water
the
trees
and
the
ground
some
birds
as
the
swallows
and
flycatchers
skim
through
the
air
to
catch
winged
insects
others
like
the
woodpeckers
and
warblers
take
the
scaly
insects
from
the
bark
of
trees
others
that
walk
on
the
ground
like
the
robin
the
thrush
meadowlark
crow
and
blackbird
eat
ground
things
such
as
the
fat
cutworms
which
mow
with
sharp
jaws
the
young
plants
of
corn
cabbage
and
onions
please
doctor
hunter
asked
rap
i
thought
crows
and
blackbirds
were
wicked
birds
that
ate
up
grain
and
corn
for
the
miller
always
puts
up
scarecrows
to
keep
them
away
but
before
the
doctor
could
answer
the
children
caught
sight
of
mammy
bun
coming
down
from
the
house
carrying
a
tray
upon
this
was
a
pitcher
some
glasses
and
a
plate
full
of
cakes
which
when
she
came
under
the
tree
they
saw
were
buns
as
light
and
brown
as
good
yeast
and
careful
baking
could
make
them
ah
mammy
mammy
cried
olive
dodo
and
nat
together
how
did
you
know
that
we
should
be
hungry
now
and
we
are
simply
famishing
well
honeys
i
jess
guessed
it
i
i
know
massa
was
suffin
and
it
allers
to
me
that
was
mighty
empty
work
i
know
massa
doctor
was
never
a
one
to
keep
his
patients
holler
and
least
his
own
folks
mammy
gave
a
big
comfortable
laugh
as
the
doctor
took
the
tray
from
her
hands
and
the
children
thanked
her
heartily
while
little
rap
smiled
hopefully
on
seeing
that
there
were
six
buns
on
the
plate
that
meant
one
for
each
and
two
for
the
doctor
he
thought
no
one
can
make
such
buns
as
mammy
said
olive
old
as
she
was
breaking
hers
in
half
to
find
the
lump
of
sugar
soaked
with
lemon
juice
that
she
knew
was
inside
she
used
to
make
them
for
me
when
i
was
a
little
girl
that
is
why
i
named
her
mammy
bun
and
we
called
her
that
ever
since
i
thought
it
was
a
funny
name
said
rap
one
for
each
of
us
and
one
for
the
dish
said
olive
passing
the
plate
around
one
for
the
dish
what
do
you
mean
said
dodo
mammy
says
it
is
always
nice
to
have
more
food
on
a
dish
than
people
are
likely
to
eat
so
that
they
shall
see
there
is
enough
and
the
dish
sha
feel
lonely
you
see
that
last
bun
belongs
to
the
dish
this
time
the
dish
will
have
to
feel
lonely
said
the
doctor
who
had
noticed
that
rap
was
looking
at
his
bun
and
not
eating
it
for
i
think
that
rap
would
like
to
take
that
one
home
to
his
mother
by
and
by
from
that
day
rap
always
believed
that
the
doctor
could
look
into
his
head
and
see
what
he
was
thinking
of
as
we
have
been
talking
about
the
that
citizen
bird
does
in
order
to
pay
his
rent
and
taxes
as
a
good
citizen
should
i
will
tell
you
of
the
six
guilds
in
birdland
into
which
these
citizens
are
divided
in
order
to
do
their
work
thoroughly
what
is
a
guild
asked
rap
a
guild
is
a
band
of
people
who
follow
the
same
trade
or
occupation
and
birds
are
banded
together
according
to
the
ways
in
which
they
work
though
some
may
belong
to
several
guilds
we
will
name
each
of
the
six
guilds
ground
gleaners
the
birds
who
feed
largely
upon
the
insects
which
live
in
on
or
near
the
ground
tree
trappers
the
birds
who
feed
on
insects
which
lurk
about
the
trunks
and
branches
of
trees
and
shrubs
sky
sweepers
the
birds
who
while
on
the
wing
catch
flying
insects
wise
watchers
the
large
silent
birds
who
sit
in
wait
for
their
prey
of
and
other
little
gnawing
mammals
as
well
as
insects
seed
sowers
the
birds
who
eat
wild
fruits
and
berries
and
after
digesting
the
pulp
and
juice
sow
the
seeds
with
their
bodily
wastage
weed
warriors
the
birds
who
crack
seeds
in
their
stout
beaks
eat
the
kernels
and
so
destroy
millions
of
harmful
you
must
write
the
names
and
definitions
of
these
six
guilds
down
in
your
books
because
when
you
hear
about
each
bird
i
will
tell
you
to
which
guild
he
belongs
and
if
you
know
where
and
upon
what
a
bird
feeds
it
will
be
easier
for
you
to
find
him
all
the
land
birds
belong
to
one
or
more
of
these
guilds
but
perhaps
we
shall
find
before
we
are
through
that
some
of
the
water
birds
have
a
guild
of
sea
sweepers
for
a
few
minutes
the
children
scribbled
away
in
silence
my
book
will
be
very
mussy
said
dodo
for
i
ca
write
well
when
i
sit
all
humped
up
on
a
branch
of
course
you
can
not
said
the
doctor
but
by
and
by
you
can
copy
it
out
neatly
in
a
clean
book
and
it
will
give
you
something
to
do
on
rainy
days
for
there
are
some
things
that
we
always
remember
better
if
we
have
once
written
them
down
presently
rap
said
it
must
be
because
you
never
have
let
any
birds
be
killed
here
that
there
are
more
kinds
than
i
ever
see
anywhere
else
some
of
every
guild
i
think
often
wondered
how
it
was
there
are
four
robins
nests
in
this
one
tree
said
olive
and
the
old
birds
have
been
flying
to
and
fro
while
we
talked
and
never
dreamed
of
being
afraid
yes
children
orchard
farm
always
has
protected
its
bird
citizens
and
it
always
will
in
my
time
and
in
mine
too
said
olive
you
see
if
each
person
would
care
for
the
birds
on
his
own
land
the
battle
of
the
bugs
would
soon
become
less
terrible
then
the
children
laughed
to
think
how
funny
a
real
battle
would
be
with
an
army
of
little
bugs
drawn
up
on
one
side
of
a
field
and
big
house
people
with
guns
and
cannons
on
the
other
but
even
against
cannon
said
olive
the
bugs
would
have
the
best
of
it
because
they
can
fly
or
hop
and
the
worms
can
crawl
into
the
ground
then
the
doctor
finished
this
lesson
by
saying
quite
seriously
every
time
you
children
deny
yourselves
the
pleasure
of
taking
an
egg
from
a
nest
or
think
to
spread
a
little
food
for
hungry
birds
when
cold
and
snow
almost
force
them
to
starve
you
are
adding
to
the
of
your
country
to
be
sure
it
may
be
only
a
few
grains
of
wheat
here
and
an
ear
of
corn
there
but
it
all
means
of
some
sort
and
the
bread
of
a
nation
is
its
life
so
we
must
learn
to
love
and
protect
this
feathered
neighbor
of
ours
who
works
for
his
own
living
as
well
as
ours
pays
his
rent
and
taxes
and
gives
besides
free
concerts
to
the
public
daily
he
certainly
deserves
the
name
of
citizen
bird
his
patriotism
which
is
simply
his
love
of
the
country
where
he
was
born
leads
him
to
return
to
it
whenever
he
thinks
of
settling
down
in
life
and
making
a
no
matter
how
far
he
may
have
wandered
away
at
any
other
time
and
this
patriotism
makes
him
one
of
the
greatest
travellers
on
the
face
of
the
earth
chapter
vi
the
bird
as
a
traveller
rap
went
up
to
orchard
farm
one
morning
very
early
to
take
nat
for
a
walk
through
the
fields
down
to
the
river
to
see
some
birds
that
had
arrived
in
the
night
it
was
only
five
but
hunter
was
walking
to
and
fro
in
the
garden
listening
to
the
burst
of
as
eagerly
as
if
it
were
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
is
one
of
the
best
parts
of
our
friendship
with
bird
people
they
never
weary
us
by
talking
too
much
and
every
spring
after
winter
silence
their
music
is
as
new
as
ever
please
uncle
roy
can
i
go
with
rap
pleaded
nat
i
will
wear
my
rubber
boots
you
may
go
if
you
eat
something
first
i
wonder
if
rap
would
invite
me
also
said
the
doctor
leading
the
way
to
the
big
kitchen
pantry
i
know
he
would
cried
nat
joyfully
he
wished
and
wished
you
would
go
with
us
but
we
did
think
you
care
to
because
you
have
been
to
the
river
woods
so
many
times
before
but
why
must
i
eat
something
uncle
i
in
such
a
hurry
to
go
because
my
boy
the
life
in
us
is
like
a
fire
that
must
be
supplied
with
fuel
to
keep
it
burning
only
instead
of
wood
or
coal
we
need
food
very
early
in
the
morning
this
life
flame
of
ours
that
is
called
vitality
is
very
low
like
a
fire
that
has
burned
down
and
if
we
go
out
in
the
damp
air
and
breathe
the
mists
that
rise
from
the
ground
our
vitality
has
not
strength
to
resist
them
but
if
we
put
fresh
fuel
on
our
inward
fire
by
eating
something
before
we
go
out
then
that
bad
little
which
we
call
malaria
has
harder
work
to
creep
into
us
how
funny
may
i
call
rap
to
tell
him
rap
rap
come
in
and
have
milk
and
something
to
eat
to
make
your
inside
fire
burn
up
chills
and
fever
rap
thought
at
first
that
nat
must
be
crazy
but
very
soon
understood
what
the
doctor
meant
and
was
overjoyed
at
the
prospect
of
having
him
join
the
expedition
dodo
will
cry
when
she
wakes
up
and
knows
where
we
have
gone
said
nat
who
had
been
much
more
kind
and
thoughtful
of
his
sister
since
coming
to
the
farm
but
kindness
is
very
catching
and
at
the
farm
everybody
was
kind
from
the
house
people
to
the
big
gray
horses
in
the
barn
which
let
the
chickens
pick
up
oats
from
between
their
powerful
hoofs
without
ever
frightening
them
by
moving
it
is
too
long
a
walk
for
little
sister
but
you
must
remember
everything
that
you
see
and
hear
and
tell
her
about
it
do
forget
the
said
the
doctor
following
the
boys
along
the
road
where
telegraph
wires
made
between
the
high
poles
you
said
a
lot
of
birds
came
last
night
said
nat
to
rap
but
how
do
you
know
that
they
came
last
night
and
where
did
they
come
from
i
know
they
came
last
night
because
they
were
not
here
yesterday
answered
rap
but
i
do
know
where
they
came
from
except
that
it
must
be
from
where
it
is
warmer
than
it
is
here
because
they
went
away
just
before
it
grew
cold
last
fall
see
doctor
there
are
some
of
them
now
on
those
fence
rails
and
more
up
on
the
telegraph
wires
the
miller
calls
them
martins
and
says
that
they
eat
up
all
the
have
they
any
other
name
because
i
have
never
seen
them
catch
bees
nat
looked
at
them
first
with
the
then
without
it
as
they
drew
quite
near
the
fence
and
saw
a
fine
bird
twice
as
long
as
his
middle
finger
its
back
and
wings
looked
dark
gray
it
was
white
underneath
with
a
touch
of
gray
on
the
breast
and
had
a
black
tail
with
white
at
the
end
of
it
as
nat
looked
the
bird
raised
a
little
tuft
of
feathers
on
top
of
its
head
as
if
angry
flew
into
the
air
giving
a
shrill
cry
seized
an
insect
and
returned
to
its
perch
that
is
the
kingbird
said
the
doctor
one
of
the
most
useful
of
the
instead
of
living
on
as
many
people
think
he
eats
very
few
of
these
but
kills
instead
thousands
of
the
bad
which
is
the
worst
enemy
this
bird
is
really
king
of
the
air
and
of
all
birds
see
how
graceful
his
flight
is
and
how
easily
be
moves
why
did
he
go
away
last
fall
asked
nat
does
he
feel
the
cold
weather
very
much
he
does
not
stay
in
the
united
states
until
the
weather
is
cold
enough
to
dull
him
but
he
has
to
move
away
for
another
reason
the
same
reason
that
forces
so
many
birds
to
leave
us
he
must
follow
his
food
this
food
consists
of
insects
different
kinds
of
flies
ants
and
grasshoppers
which
disappear
or
die
as
the
air
grows
cold
rap
have
you
ever
noticed
the
difference
between
the
sounds
in
a
spring
night
and
a
night
in
autumn
in
spring
the
air
is
humming
with
the
calls
of
all
sorts
of
insects
but
in
autumn
it
is
silent
and
even
the
crickets
have
stopped
chirping
so
about
the
last
of
september
our
kingbirds
who
live
everywhere
in
the
united
states
gather
in
flocks
start
to
find
a
place
where
insects
are
still
stirring
about
and
fly
southward
following
the
and
the
great
rivers
for
paths
those
from
the
eastern
part
of
the
country
stop
in
central
america
or
fly
on
to
south
america
and
those
from
the
western
part
often
stop
in
mexico
but
how
can
they
fly
so
far
said
nat
it
hundreds
of
miles
and
how
do
they
find
the
way
the
flight
of
a
bird
is
a
wonderful
thing
my
boy
he
spreads
those
frail
wings
of
his
and
launches
into
the
air
up
up
above
trees
and
steeples
then
on
and
on
being
able
to
fly
several
hundred
miles
without
resting
some
birds
when
the
wind
aids
them
cover
more
than
a
hundred
miles
in
a
single
hour
as
to
the
way
the
eye
of
the
bird
is
like
a
telescope
it
magnifies
and
sees
from
very
far
off
flying
through
the
upper
air
the
bird
watches
the
line
of
coast
and
river
and
the
instinct
that
is
placed
in
him
says
these
so
he
follows
them
remembering
that
by
doing
so
he
has
found
a
place
of
safety
in
other
seasons
all
through
the
spring
and
all
through
the
autumn
birds
take
these
mysterious
flights
for
so
they
always
seem
to
house
people
as
flock
after
flock
gathers
and
disappears
you
can
watch
them
sometimes
passing
by
day
so
high
in
the
sky
that
they
seem
like
then
perhaps
you
will
only
hear
a
faint
and
see
nothing
at
night
the
sound
of
many
voices
falls
from
the
clouds
sometimes
it
will
be
the
tinkling
bell
of
bobolinks
sometimes
the
feeble
peep
of
snipes
and
sometimes
the
hoarse
honk
of
wild
geese
why
uncle
roy
can
you
tell
a
bird
name
without
seeing
it
only
by
one
little
cry
yes
my
lad
when
you
have
lived
with
birds
as
long
as
i
have
you
will
know
their
different
voices
as
you
do
those
of
your
own
family
when
some
one
calls
you
in
the
garden
ca
you
tell
whether
it
is
dodo
or
olive
yes
but
their
voices
are
so
different
so
are
the
voices
of
birds
when
you
know
them
well
but
the
young
birds
who
have
been
hatched
up
here
how
do
they
know
about
going
the
first
time
asked
rap
the
young
ones
are
led
in
their
journeys
with
signals
and
cries
by
their
parents
they
in
turn
lead
their
own
young
and
so
the
knowledge
is
kept
up
endlessly
i
can
see
why
they
go
south
said
rap
after
thinking
a
few
moments
but
why
do
they
come
back
again
why
do
they
stay
and
build
their
nests
down
there
that
is
a
difficult
question
to
answer
said
the
doctor
and
one
that
we
house
people
try
to
explain
in
different
ways
i
think
that
the
love
of
the
place
where
they
were
born
is
strong
enough
in
birds
to
bring
them
back
every
season
to
build
their
nests
so
you
see
that
citizen
bird
is
a
patriot
for
though
he
may
be
in
the
midst
of
plenty
in
a
tropical
forest
when
the
time
comes
he
travels
hundreds
of
miles
to
his
native
land
to
make
the
young
that
will
fly
from
his
nest
citizens
like
himself
but
the
birds
that
can
eat
seeds
and
other
things
do
not
travel
so
far
do
they
asked
rap
no
the
birds
who
rove
about
the
united
states
throughout
the
year
are
either
weed
warriors
or
seed
sowers
or
those
tree
trappers
who
creep
about
picking
the
eggs
and
grubs
of
insects
from
the
bark
or
else
those
great
cannibal
birds
the
wise
watchers
who
eat
the
flesh
of
their
smaller
brothers
as
well
as
of
rats
mice
and
all
such
vermin
the
hawks
and
owls
or
else
they
are
gulls
terns
fishing
ducks
and
a
great
many
other
kinds
of
sea
birds
who
feed
on
fish
and
pick
up
the
scraps
floating
on
the
surface
of
sea
lake
and
river
do
the
barn
swallows
that
are
making
nests
in
the
hayloft
go
as
far
south
as
kingbirds
asked
nat
yes
indeed
the
swallows
swift
flight
carries
them
far
and
wide
for
not
only
do
they
make
homes
all
through
north
america
but
they
are
so
sure
of
wing
and
confident
of
outstripping
any
cannibal
birds
who
might
try
to
chase
them
that
when
they
leave
us
they
fly
by
day
and
often
stop
for
a
little
visit
in
the
west
indies
on
their
way
to
south
america
suppose
uncle
roy
when
they
are
travelling
a
storm
comes
up
and
it
grows
so
foggy
they
ca
see
how
to
follow
the
rivers
do
they
sometimes
lose
themselves
yes
very
often
they
become
confused
and
fly
this
way
and
that
but
always
toward
the
nearest
place
where
they
see
a
light
as
if
it
meant
escape
for
them
but
this
instinct
is
frequently
their
death
for
they
fly
against
the
towers
of
great
lighthouses
or
the
windows
of
tall
buildings
or
even
electric
wires
and
thus
break
their
necks
or
wings
that
is
why
i
have
so
often
found
dead
birds
along
the
turnpike
under
the
telegraph
wires
said
rap
yes
rap
the
inventions
of
man
are
very
wonderful
but
some
of
them
have
been
sad
things
for
bird
people
and
this
is
another
reason
why
we
should
protect
them
whenever
we
can
these
journeys
that
the
birds
make
when
they
leave
their
nesting
haunts
for
the
winter
season
and
return
again
in
spring
are
called
the
word
means
to
move
from
one
country
to
another
with
the
intention
of
remaining
there
for
some
time
the
birds
who
only
make
little
trips
about
the
country
never
staying
long
in
one
place
we
call
visitors
birds
may
be
divided
according
to
their
journeys
into
three
groups
which
will
help
you
to
place
them
citizens
those
bird
people
whose
families
stay
in
or
near
the
same
place
the
year
round
roving
about
somewhat
according
to
the
and
weather
summer
citizens
the
families
that
though
they
are
with
us
but
six
or
eight
months
of
the
year
make
their
homes
here
and
pay
their
rent
and
taxes
by
working
for
the
common
good
as
they
are
almost
all
they
are
even
more
useful
than
the
citizens
who
are
chiefly
or
cannibals
winter
visitors
the
birds
who
come
down
from
the
north
in
severe
weather
but
do
not
stay
in
one
place
for
any
particular
time
arriving
one
day
and
disappearing
the
next
they
glean
for
their
scanty
board
and
return
to
the
cold
countries
of
which
they
are
citizens
before
please
tell
me
the
names
of
some
of
the
birds
that
live
here
all
the
time
said
nat
have
i
seen
any
yet
i
think
the
bluebird
the
robin
and
the
song
sparrow
are
citizens
said
rap
because
last
winter
i
used
to
see
one
of
two
almost
every
day
unless
the
snow
and
ice
were
very
thick
yes
said
the
doctor
the
bluebird
is
a
citizen
in
the
middle
and
southern
states
and
the
robin
also
but
in
the
more
northerly
parts
they
are
summer
citizens
returning
early
and
staying
late
but
the
song
sparrow
is
a
citizen
almost
everywhere
and
is
known
about
every
bushy
garden
from
the
east
coast
to
the
west
and
from
the
cotton
plantation
to
the
land
of
snow
please
tell
me
the
names
of
some
winter
visitors
said
rap
is
the
great
white
owl
one
of
these
yes
the
snowy
owl
is
one
of
them
so
is
the
snowflake
who
comes
to
us
on
the
wings
of
the
storm
the
tiny
winter
wren
the
great
northern
shrike
and
many
others
who
arrive
when
is
upon
us
in
the
temperate
part
of
the
country
after
our
song
birds
have
flown
to
the
warmer
south
you
shall
hear
of
all
these
and
learn
where
each
one
lives
in
the
bird
stories
i
am
going
to
write
for
you
but
now
let
us
go
down
by
the
river
and
see
what
some
of
these
newly
arrived
birds
are
doing
after
their
long
journey
hark
i
hear
the
notes
of
a
thrasher
in
those
bushes
and
the
blackbirds
are
calling
all
through
the
marsh
meadow
when
i
was
a
boy
the
alder
bushes
were
always
full
of
nests
they
have
nests
there
now
said
rap
eagerly
a
great
many
nests
and
they
are
very
pretty
ah
there
is
the
big
brown
bird
that
you
call
a
thrasher
with
his
striped
breast
and
long
tail
that
spreads
like
a
fan
i
see
him
he
is
building
in
that
barberry
bush
then
the
nest
comes
pretty
soon
after
the
said
nat
yes
answered
the
doctor
as
he
watched
the
antics
of
the
thrasher
right
after
the
journey
the
mate
and
next
the
nest
do
not
forget
the
mate
nat
for
it
is
bird
who
usually
makes
the
nest
and
lays
the
eggs
besides
working
in
the
guilds
with
her
husband
whose
greatest
distinction
is
in
being
the
family
musician
when
do
the
summer
citizens
begin
to
come
back
to
their
nesting
places
asked
nat
and
when
do
they
go
away
again
the
great
bird
procession
begins
the
first
of
march
with
bluebirds
robins
redwings
and
meadowlarks
but
it
is
the
first
of
june
before
the
latest
comers
the
little
marsh
wrens
are
settled
then
in
autumn
from
september
until
the
first
snows
of
december
fall
the
procession
flutters
back
south
again
one
by
one
or
in
great
flocks
dropping
away
like
falling
leaves
in
the
forest
and
the
birds
that
we
see
later
are
likely
to
be
citizens
the
early
robin
may
have
a
second
brood
and
the
hummingbird
eggs
in
her
nest
before
the
marsh
wrens
have
even
been
seen
in
the
southern
states
the
birds
arrive
and
build
sooner
than
in
the
northern
a
cold
spring
may
delay
the
migration
or
a
warm
autumn
retard
the
return
movement
but
as
you
study
birds
you
will
soon
see
that
each
one
has
his
own
place
in
the
procession
and
usually
keeps
it
year
by
year
this
vast
procession
goes
on
in
the
air
back
and
forth
night
and
day
like
the
ceaseless
ebb
and
flow
of
the
tides
at
sea
flow
on
forever
in
their
appointed
times
and
none
of
nature
aspects
are
more
regular
or
more
unfailing
it
almost
seems
boys
as
if
birds
made
the
seasons
as
if
winter
in
the
middle
and
northern
states
might
be
called
the
season
chapter
vii
the
bird
nest
i
wonder
why
some
birds
build
their
nests
so
very
early
when
it
is
cold
and
there
are
no
leaves
on
the
trees
while
others
wait
until
it
is
almost
summer
said
rap
as
they
walked
down
a
narrow
lane
toward
the
river
there
were
bushes
lining
the
path
on
each
side
and
from
the
singing
you
would
think
that
every
bush
had
a
bird
on
each
twig
in
fact
there
were
so
many
birds
in
sight
that
nat
did
not
know
which
to
ask
about
first
and
so
kept
looking
instead
of
talking
the
birds
who
are
citizens
are
usually
the
first
to
build
answered
the
doctor
they
merely
roved
about
during
the
winter
months
and
had
no
long
journey
to
make
before
they
reached
the
home
trees
again
and
then
the
hardy
birds
can
return
from
the
south
much
earlier
than
their
frailer
kin
last
year
said
rap
when
the
men
were
chopping
trees
in
the
great
wood
beyond
the
lake
the
miller
went
up
one
day
to
hunt
coons
and
took
me
with
him
it
was
the
beginning
of
march
and
terribly
cold
there
were
long
icicles
hanging
on
the
trees
and
we
were
glad
enough
to
go
in
by
the
fire
in
the
lumbermen
camp
but
what
do
you
think
if
there
was
an
owl
nest
up
in
a
pine
tree
with
two
eggs
in
it
it
was
in
a
very
lonely
place
and
the
miller
said
the
owl
had
borrowed
an
old
crow
nest
and
fixed
it
up
a
little
i
should
think
the
eggs
would
have
frozen
hard
and
been
spoiled
said
nat
no
the
old
owl
sat
on
them
ever
so
tight
and
would
hardly
budge
to
let
the
miller
see
them
we
did
stay
long
for
the
owl
was
a
savage
big
thing
nearly
two
feet
high
with
yellow
eyes
and
long
feathers
sticking
up
on
its
head
like
horns
a
great
horned
owl
said
the
doctor
i
only
wonder
that
it
let
the
miller
go
near
it
at
all
they
are
generally
very
wild
and
fierce
this
one
was
sort
of
friends
with
the
lumbermen
continued
rap
for
they
used
to
hang
lumps
of
raw
meat
on
the
bushes
for
it
and
they
said
it
kept
the
rats
and
mice
away
from
the
camp
and
was
good
company
for
them
it
frightened
me
when
i
heard
it
first
it
gave
an
awful
scream
like
a
hurt
person
after
a
while
another
one
began
to
bark
like
a
dog
with
a
cold
just
like
this
hoo
hoo
hoo
and
doctor
one
of
the
lumbermen
told
me
that
with
owls
and
hawks
the
female
is
mostly
bigger
than
the
male
do
you
think
that
is
so
because
with
singing
birds
the
male
is
the
largest
among
cannibal
birds
the
female
is
usually
the
largest
answered
the
doctor
who
was
pleased
to
see
that
rap
so
often
had
a
because
for
his
questions
these
birds
do
a
great
deal
of
fighting
both
in
catching
their
living
prey
and
holding
their
own
against
enemies
and
as
the
female
stays
most
at
home
being
the
chief
protector
of
the
nest
she
needs
more
strength
some
singing
birds
are
real
plucky
too
said
rap
that
same
year
i
found
a
robin
nest
in
april
when
the
by
the
well
froze
every
night
and
a
woodcock
nest
in
the
brushwood
it
hard
to
see
a
woodcock
on
the
nest
they
look
so
like
dead
leaves
it
snowed
a
little
that
afternoon
and
the
poor
bird
back
was
all
white
but
there
she
sat
it
made
me
feel
so
sorry
and
i
was
so
afraid
she
might
freeze
that
i
made
a
little
roof
over
her
of
hemlock
branches
and
she
liked
that
and
did
move
at
all
so
then
i
wiped
the
snow
off
her
back
and
she
seemed
real
comfortable
i
used
to
go
back
every
day
after
that
to
see
her
we
grew
to
be
quite
friends
before
the
four
eggs
hatched
and
i
seen
them
do
queer
little
tricks
but
i
never
told
anybody
where
she
lived
though
because
lots
of
people
do
seem
to
understand
anything
about
birds
but
shooting
or
teasing
them
some
day
you
shall
tell
us
about
what
the
woodcock
did
my
lad
you
must
tell
us
a
great
many
stories
for
you
know
what
you
have
seen
yourself
that
is
the
best
knowledge
of
all
and
it
will
encourage
nat
to
hear
you
and
hunter
put
his
arm
affectionately
around
the
shoulders
of
each
boy
hush
wait
a
moment
and
listen
to
that
thrasher
said
the
doctor
stopping
behind
some
thick
bushes
he
is
wooing
his
mate
what
is
wooing
whispered
nat
asking
her
to
marry
him
and
come
and
build
a
cosy
home
in
one
of
these
nice
bushes
listen
see
there
he
is
up
on
the
very
top
of
that
young
birch
with
his
head
thrown
back
singing
as
if
his
throat
would
split
as
the
children
looked
up
they
saw
a
fine
bird
with
a
curved
beak
back
and
light
breast
streaked
with
black
who
was
clinging
to
a
slender
spray
jerking
his
long
tail
while
he
sang
it
seems
as
if
i
could
almost
hear
the
words
he
says
said
rap
birds
sing
in
many
different
tones
said
the
doctor
the
song
is
like
some
one
talking
cheerfully
the
meadowlark
is
the
oriole
is
more
like
clarion
notes
the
bobolink
bubbles
over
like
a
babbling
brook
while
the
dear
little
brown
striped
song
sparrow
who
is
with
us
in
hedge
and
garden
all
the
year
sings
pleasant
ballads
there
are
some
birds
that
olive
told
me
ca
sing
a
bit
said
nat
but
only
call
and
squeak
how
do
they
ask
their
mates
to
marry
them
all
birds
have
alarm
cries
and
a
that
serves
the
same
purpose
as
a
song
although
it
may
not
seem
at
all
musical
to
us
we
are
naturally
more
interested
in
that
order
of
birds
whose
voices
are
the
most
perfectly
developed
these
not
only
sing
when
they
are
courting
but
all
the
time
their
mates
are
sitting
upon
the
eggs
and
until
the
young
are
ready
to
fly
why
do
birds
always
build
nests
in
spring
asked
nat
i
think
because
there
is
more
for
them
to
feed
the
little
ones
with
than
when
it
gets
to
be
hot
and
dry
said
rap
and
it
gives
them
time
to
grow
big
and
strong
before
winter
comes
when
they
must
go
away
quite
right
rap
and
it
also
gives
the
parents
a
chance
to
shed
the
old
feathers
that
have
been
worn
by
rubbing
on
the
nest
grow
a
new
thick
warm
coat
for
winter
and
rest
themselves
before
they
set
out
on
their
autumn
journey
do
you
remember
what
i
told
you
that
rainy
day
in
my
study
about
this
moulting
or
changing
of
feathers
yes
i
do
said
rap
and
nat
together
most
birds
have
two
coats
a
year
and
the
male
is
the
brighter
continued
nat
eagerly
proud
to
show
that
he
remembered
the
one
that
comes
out
in
the
spring
is
the
gayest
so
that
his
mate
shall
admire
him
and
when
this
coat
comes
he
sings
his
very
best
and
stop
and
take
breath
my
boy
laughed
the
doctor
there
is
plenty
of
time
why
do
we
think
that
the
male
has
the
gayest
feathers
do
you
remember
that
also
no
i
forgotten
said
nat
i
remember
cried
rap
it
is
to
please
the
female
and
because
she
sits
so
much
on
the
nest
that
if
her
feathers
were
as
bright
as
the
male
her
enemies
would
see
her
quicker
and
when
the
little
birds
hatch
out
they
are
mostly
in
plain
colors
too
like
their
mother
oh
i
remember
that
now
said
nat
and
after
the
young
are
hatched
and
the
old
birds
need
new
coats
they
keep
rather
still
while
they
shed
their
feathers
because
they
feel
weak
and
ca
fly
well
then
when
the
new
feathers
come
they
are
sometimes
quite
different
from
the
old
ones
and
seldom
quite
so
bright
why
is
this
nat
asked
the
doctor
but
nat
could
not
think
and
rap
answered
because
in
the
autumn
when
they
make
the
long
journeys
the
leaves
are
falling
from
the
trees
and
if
they
were
very
bright
the
cannibal
birds
would
see
them
too
quickly
have
i
told
you
about
the
bluebird
and
how
though
he
only
sheds
his
feathers
once
a
year
yet
his
winter
coat
is
rusty
and
not
bright
clear
blue
as
it
is
in
spring
i
think
not
answered
nat
well
the
outside
edges
of
its
feathers
are
blue
but
a
little
deeper
in
the
feather
is
brownish
so
when
they
have
worn
the
same
feathers
many
months
and
rubbed
in
and
out
of
their
little
houses
and
bathed
a
great
deal
and
cleaned
their
feathers
off
every
day
in
the
dust
as
birds
always
do
the
blue
ends
wear
off
and
the
rusty
parts
show
it
is
quite
worth
while
to
tell
little
people
things
when
they
have
the
patience
to
listen
and
the
interest
to
remember
yes
uncle
but
it
the
way
you
tell
us
about
birds
that
makes
us
remember
you
talk
as
if
they
were
real
people
oh
oh
nat
laughed
the
doctor
if
you
flatter
me
so
i
shall
have
to
hide
my
head
in
a
bush
like
an
ostrich
birds
people
though
of
another
race
from
ours
and
i
am
happy
if
i
can
make
you
think
so
ah
we
must
be
near
a
redwing
nest
what
a
commotion
the
colony
is
making
colony
i
thought
a
colony
was
a
lot
of
people
who
went
off
into
a
strange
wild
land
and
made
a
new
home
said
nat
that
is
one
meaning
of
the
word
but
another
one
is
when
a
number
of
people
of
the
same
race
or
trade
live
close
to
each
other
a
bird
colony
is
a
collection
of
the
homes
of
many
birds
of
the
same
family
after
the
nesting
season
almost
all
birds
live
in
flocks
of
different
sizes
each
particular
kind
flocking
by
itself
but
during
the
migrations
great
flocks
are
often
made
up
of
smaller
flocks
of
various
kinds
of
birds
during
the
nesting
season
it
is
quite
different
the
majority
of
birds
prefer
a
quiet
home
life
each
pair
being
independent
of
any
others
certain
flocks
however
keep
together
and
all
build
their
nests
in
a
particular
swamp
or
wood
and
sometimes
it
is
said
male
birds
build
nests
to
sleep
in
while
the
females
are
sitting
the
redwings
nest
in
colonies
so
do
the
herons
who
eat
frogs
and
nest
near
water
and
the
little
bank
swallows
who
live
in
holes
that
they
dig
for
themselves
in
high
banks
there
were
some
twenty
pairs
of
birds
in
this
redwing
colony
who
seemed
to
be
much
frightened
by
the
approach
of
visitors
here
is
a
nest
in
this
alder
bush
said
the
doctor
step
carefully
on
the
grass
hummocks
and
look
at
it
for
a
moment
nat
see
how
neatly
it
is
made
of
the
dried
leaves
of
flags
and
grasses
woven
in
and
out
between
three
upright
stalks
is
it
pretty
said
nat
so
even
and
deep
like
a
cup
and
not
at
all
ragged
and
mussy
like
a
robin
nest
there
are
a
great
many
different
kinds
of
nests
are
there
uncle
yes
the
nests
of
birds
are
almost
as
different
as
their
songs
and
other
habits
and
the
higher
the
order
the
brood
belongs
to
the
better
built
is
the
nest
the
lower
orders
often
only
make
a
hollow
in
the
ground
or
grass
but
do
not
collect
material
and
in
the
true
sense
none
such
can
be
called
architects
what
is
an
architect
asked
nat
who
thought
it
was
a
pretty
big
name
for
any
sort
of
a
bird
an
architect
my
boy
said
the
doctor
is
anybody
who
knows
how
to
build
anything
as
it
ought
to
be
built
to
look
the
best
and
be
the
most
useful
whether
it
is
a
house
or
a
nest
i
wonder
why
nests
are
so
different
said
rap
looking
down
the
lane
toward
the
river
where
the
sun
was
streaming
in
and
so
many
little
birds
were
flying
to
and
fro
that
they
seemed
like
last
year
leaves
being
blown
about
because
as
the
habits
of
the
birds
cause
them
to
live
in
different
places
and
feed
in
various
ways
so
their
homes
must
be
suitable
to
their
surroundings
and
be
built
in
the
best
way
to
protect
the
young
birds
from
harm
to
keep
them
safe
from
house
people
cannibal
birds
and
bad
weather
the
trim
thrushes
and
sparrows
who
are
all
brownish
birds
and
find
their
insect
or
seed
food
on
or
near
the
ground
build
open
nests
low
down
in
trees
and
bushes
or
on
the
earth
itself
but
the
gorgeous
baltimore
oriole
with
his
flaming
feathers
makes
a
long
nest
of
string
and
strong
plant
fibres
which
he
swings
high
up
in
an
elm
tree
where
it
can
not
be
reached
from
below
and
the
leaves
hide
this
cradle
while
the
winds
rock
it
he
knows
that
it
would
never
do
to
trust
his
brilliant
feathers
down
by
the
ground
the
frail
hummingbird
has
no
real
strength
to
fight
enemies
bigger
than
its
tiny
self
but
it
has
been
given
for
protection
the
power
of
flying
as
quick
as
a
whizzing
bullet
and
courage
enough
to
attack
even
a
kingbird
in
defence
of
its
nest
which
is
a
tiny
circle
of
down
covered
with
lichens
and
is
so
fastened
across
a
branch
that
it
looks
like
a
knot
of
the
limb
itself
the
woodcock
you
saw
that
snowy
day
rap
knows
the
protection
of
color
and
draws
together
for
a
nest
a
few
leaves
of
the
hue
of
her
own
feathers
this
nest
and
the
bird
upon
it
are
so
blended
together
that
few
eyes
could
separate
them
some
birds
do
not
make
any
nests
but
live
in
holes
like
squirrels
and
coons
said
rap
woodpeckers
and
all
those
there
again
the
home
is
suited
to
the
occupation
of
the
bird
said
the
doctor
for
woodpeckers
are
tree
trappers
who
find
their
food
by
creeping
about
trees
and
picking
insects
and
grubs
from
the
bark
what
more
natural
than
that
they
should
have
a
house
close
at
hand
in
some
tree
whose
wood
is
soft
enough
to
be
hollowed
out
you
see
they
have
a
bill
like
a
chisel
for
gouging
out
insects
and
with
this
same
tool
they
make
their
homes
bluebirds
and
wrens
and
martins
like
to
live
in
holes
and
boxes
though
they
ca
make
holes
for
themselves
said
rap
yes
the
habits
of
many
birds
have
changed
since
the
country
has
become
civilized
and
house
people
are
to
be
found
in
all
parts
of
it
many
birds
who
have
always
been
favorites
with
man
and
have
been
protected
by
him
have
gradually
grown
less
wild
or
almost
tame
and
now
prefer
living
near
houses
and
barns
to
building
in
wilder
places
the
bluebird
martin
and
wren
are
three
very
popular
birds
they
appreciate
cosy
homes
and
are
grateful
for
the
boxes
built
for
them
though
we
know
that
before
they
had
such
things
they
must
have
nested
in
tree
holes
i
wonder
where
the
chimney
swifts
lived
before
there
were
any
chimneys
said
rap
looking
across
the
fields
to
where
an
old
stone
chimney
stood
the
only
thing
left
standing
of
an
old
farmhouse
above
this
chimney
swifts
were
circling
in
shifting
curves
now
diving
inside
it
now
disappearing
afar
in
the
air
we
think
they
must
have
lived
in
hollow
trees
as
the
tree
swallows
do
now
said
the
doctor
but
when
house
people
began
to
clear
the
land
they
naturally
cut
down
the
dead
trees
first
and
so
the
birds
moved
to
the
chimneys
i
used
to
call
those
birds
chimney
but
olive
says
they
are
made
more
like
hummingbirds
and
nighthawks
than
real
swallows
continued
rap
nighthawks
said
nat
i
thought
olive
said
hawks
were
cannibal
birds
how
are
they
relations
of
swallows
that
is
a
mistake
a
great
many
people
make
said
the
doctor
for
the
nighthawk
is
not
a
real
hawk
but
a
shy
bird
who
has
a
rapid
flight
though
it
eats
nothing
but
beetles
moths
and
other
insects
hark
do
you
hear
that
cry
high
in
the
air
as
if
something
was
saying
said
nat
yes
that
is
a
nighthawk
on
its
way
home
look
he
is
over
us
now
and
you
can
see
two
large
white
spots
like
holes
in
his
wings
by
these
you
can
tell
it
from
any
of
the
real
hawks
does
he
build
high
up
in
a
tree
asked
rap
i
have
never
found
his
nest
there
is
a
good
reason
for
that
said
the
doctor
there
is
no
nest
two
eggs
are
laid
on
the
bare
ground
that
is
about
the
same
color
as
the
bird
itself
and
the
eggs
look
too
much
like
streaky
pebbles
to
be
easily
seen
when
the
young
are
hatched
they
keep
still
until
they
are
able
to
fly
and
are
colored
so
exactly
like
the
place
upon
which
they
rest
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
see
them
even
if
you
know
where
they
are
how
much
there
is
to
learn
sighed
nat
i
afraid
you
will
have
to
make
us
a
big
book
instead
of
a
little
one
uncle
roy
to
teach
us
all
these
things
olive
and
rap
have
such
a
start
of
us
dodo
and
i
know
much
of
anything
and
even
what
i
thought
i
knew
about
birds
very
true
do
be
discouraged
my
boy
you
do
not
need
a
big
book
a
little
one
will
do
for
the
present
what
you
need
is
patience
a
pair
of
keen
eyes
and
a
good
memory
with
these
and
a
little
help
from
olive
rap
and
your
old
uncle
you
can
learn
to
know
a
hundred
kinds
of
birds
those
that
can
be
found
easily
and
have
either
the
sweetest
songs
the
gayest
plumage
or
the
most
interesting
habits
some
we
shall
find
here
in
the
lane
and
swamp
meadow
or
by
the
river
others
have
made
their
home
in
my
orchard
for
years
and
i
am
going
to
put
in
the
book
more
than
a
hundred
beautiful
pictures
for
you
and
dodo
drawn
so
naturally
that
you
can
tell
every
one
of
the
birds
by
them
and
that
will
make
it
easier
for
you
to
understand
what
you
read
for
some
of
the
water
birds
we
must
go
up
to
the
lake
or
in
the
summer
make
a
trip
over
to
the
seashore
how
do
you
like
that
yes
you
too
rap
by
and
by
when
you
know
these
hundred
birds
by
name
and
by
sight
you
will
be
so
far
along
on
the
road
into
birdland
that
you
can
choose
your
own
way
and
branch
off
right
and
left
on
whatever
path
seems
most
attractive
to
you
but
then
you
will
need
big
books
and
have
to
learn
long
hard
latin
names
what
birds
will
you
begin
with
please
doctor
roy
said
rap
the
singers
or
the
cannibals
the
singers
because
they
will
interest
dodo
and
nat
the
most
easily
as
they
do
you
then
we
will
talk
about
the
birds
that
only
croak
and
call
then
the
cannibal
birds
next
those
that
coo
and
those
that
scratch
for
a
living
then
we
must
leave
dry
land
and
go
close
to
the
water
to
find
the
birds
that
wade
and
finally
we
must
go
to
the
lake
or
sea
itself
for
the
birds
that
swim
and
dive
why
here
quick
cried
nat
as
the
little
came
leaping
down
the
lane
tracking
them
nose
to
the
ground
how
did
you
get
out
of
the
barn
sir
i
suspect
that
dodo
has
discovered
that
we
are
missing
and
is
looking
for
us
said
the
doctor
there
is
the
breakfast
bell
do
you
realize
my
lads
that
we
have
been
out
two
hours
i
often
come
out
early
in
the
morning
said
rap
so
it
does
seem
strange
to
me
i
starving
uncle
roy
said
nat
though
i
am
only
beginning
to
feel
it
think
how
much
worse
you
would
have
felt
if
you
had
not
eaten
some
bread
and
milk
before
you
started
yes
indeed
said
nat
do
many
sicknesses
come
from
not
eating
enough
not
so
many
as
come
from
eating
too
much
laughed
the
doctor
wo
you
come
up
to
breakfast
with
us
rap
there
is
always
room
at
my
table
you
know
for
children
who
love
their
bird
brothers
i
ca
said
rap
regretfully
you
see
it
thursday
and
i
have
to
mind
clothes
there
was
a
merry
breakfast
party
that
morning
at
orchard
farm
nat
had
so
much
to
tell
and
the
doctor
said
he
felt
twenty
years
younger
after
his
walk
with
the
boys
a
letter
had
also
arrived
which
made
nat
and
dodo
very
happy
it
was
from
their
mother
who
said
we
are
delighted
to
hear
that
the
doctor
is
going
to
tell
you
bird
stories
this
summer
be
sure
to
ask
olive
to
tell
you
all
she
knows
about
the
flowers
too
when
we
come
home
this
autumn
perhaps
your
uncle
will
ask
us
to
the
farm
for
a
visit
and
then
we
shall
see
your
friend
rap
uncle
uncle
cried
both
the
children
will
you
ask
mother
and
father
to
come
here
for
a
little
it
will
be
lovely
and
and
then
we
have
to
go
away
so
soon
either
i
have
already
asked
them
for
a
long
visit
you
little
rogues
said
the
doctor
you
seem
to
forget
that
your
mother
is
my
sister
whom
i
wish
very
much
to
see
and
does
olive
know
all
the
flowers
chimed
in
dodo
and
will
you
tell
us
about
everything
that
would
be
a
rash
promise
said
the
doctor
laughing
but
if
you
will
stay
long
enough
i
will
promise
to
teach
you
something
about
all
the
little
wild
beasts
and
bugs
that
live
here
the
flowers
that
bloom
about
us
the
earth
moon
and
perhaps
even
a
star
or
two
who
knows
is
it
a
bargain
oh
was
all
they
said
but
dodo
gave
him
a
kiss
on
the
end
of
his
nose
and
nat
hugged
olive
who
sat
next
to
him
just
then
mammy
bun
brought
in
a
plate
of
steaming
hot
flannel
cakes
and
the
doctor
said
now
let
us
eat
to
the
health
of
birdland
and
a
happy
season
at
orchard
farm
olive
my
love
please
pass
the
maple
syrup
chapter
viii
beginning
of
the
bird
stories
when
the
day
came
for
beginning
the
bird
stories
warm
spring
showers
were
drenching
the
orchard
so
that
apple
blossoms
and
raindrops
fell
to
the
ground
together
when
the
children
gathered
in
the
wonder
room
once
more
this
time
there
was
no
fire
on
the
hearth
through
the
open
window
floated
bits
of
and
the
fragrance
of
the
lilacs
for
there
were
lilac
bushes
all
about
orchard
farm
close
to
the
house
by
the
gate
posts
and
in
a
long
hedge
that
ran
down
one
side
of
the
garden
to
the
orchard
itself
these
tall
bushes
of
purple
and
white
lilacs
were
veritable
music
boxes
for
almost
every
one
held
a
catbird
nest
what
bird
do
you
think
uncle
roy
will
tell
us
about
first
said
nat
to
rap
as
they
walked
about
the
room
looking
at
the
birds
in
the
cases
while
the
doctor
was
reading
letters
which
olive
had
brought
in
i
wish
he
would
begin
with
that
lovely
fat
bird
with
all
the
red
and
green
and
blue
feathers
said
dodo
pointing
to
a
wood
duck
i
wonder
if
it
sings
no
that
a
duck
and
they
do
sing
said
rap
they
gabble
and
squawk
and
swim
in
the
water
but
they
can
fly
as
quick
as
swallows
for
all
they
look
so
heavy
i
wish
he
would
begin
with
this
little
mite
of
a
thing
that
is
much
bigger
than
a
bee
said
nat
showing
rap
a
hummingbird
i
do
care
what
bird
he
starts
with
said
rap
only
i
hope
he
will
begin
at
the
very
beginning
that
is
a
good
idea
my
boy
said
the
doctor
who
had
finished
his
letters
and
was
leaving
his
desk
only
what
and
where
is
the
beginning
the
children
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
and
olive
said
that
is
a
very
hard
question
for
them
to
answer
no
wonder
they
looked
so
puzzled
father
then
the
doctor
laughed
and
said
the
people
who
have
studied
the
birds
bone
by
bone
and
feather
by
feather
have
grouped
these
citizens
into
orders
and
families
to
prevent
confusion
so
that
we
may
easily
tell
the
relationship
between
them
these
lists
sometimes
begin
with
the
lowest
order
nearest
to
the
crawling
reptile
brethren
the
least
interesting
birds
that
have
no
song
and
can
not
fly
well
but
swim
and
dive
in
the
water
and
end
with
the
beautiful
singing
birds
that
live
in
our
gardens
could
you
begin
with
the
dear
singing
birds
and
end
with
the
clumsy
diving
ones
asked
rap
earnestly
it
so
much
easier
learning
about
things
near
home
you
are
right
my
boy
in
learning
anything
whether
of
bird
insect
or
flower
begin
at
home
and
let
this
be
the
centre
from
which
you
work
your
way
onward
and
outward
then
you
will
be
sure
of
what
you
learn
and
ever
afterward
though
you
may
follow
strange
birds
all
over
the
known
world
you
will
come
home
again
to
find
that
there
are
none
more
charming
and
lovable
than
those
few
whose
acquaintance
you
will
make
this
summer
i
do
not
wish
you
to
be
confused
by
long
words
so
i
shall
give
you
their
plain
english
names
and
divide
these
birds
of
our
stories
into
six
classes
by
and
by
when
you
have
heard
a
few
facts
about
them
we
will
group
them
into
families
and
i
will
tell
you
so
much
that
if
you
use
your
eyes
well
you
will
be
able
to
name
any
one
of
these
birds
when
you
see
it
out
in
the
open
air
you
must
always
remember
children
when
you
see
birds
flying
about
that
you
will
not
notice
many
little
markings
and
bits
of
color
that
would
be
quite
plain
to
you
if
you
held
the
bird
in
your
hand
or
looked
at
it
in
a
case
as
you
look
at
these
stuffed
ones
now
a
bird
whose
breast
is
spotted
may
look
striped
when
seen
at
a
distance
when
you
are
in
doubt
about
the
name
of
a
bird
that
you
have
seen
you
can
come
here
and
look
for
it
but
very
few
children
can
do
so
at
best
they
can
only
look
at
pictures
and
i
do
not
wish
you
to
depend
upon
the
specimens
in
this
room
no
said
rap
because
if
our
bird
stories
are
printed
and
other
children
read
them
they
may
not
have
an
uncle
with
a
room
and
so
they
must
learn
the
names
without
that
is
another
reason
why
we
must
have
a
great
many
pictures
in
our
book
for
these
children
said
the
doctor
now
write
the
names
of
the
six
classes
into
which
all
our
birds
are
to
be
gathered
i
the
birds
that
sing
ii
the
birds
that
croak
and
call
iii
the
birds
that
are
cannibals
iv
the
birds
that
coo
and
scratch
the
birds
that
wade
and
paddle
vi
the
birds
that
swim
and
dive
squeak
squeak
went
three
pencils
two
going
fast
and
one
toiling
along
as
if
it
was
lame
and
needed
sharpening
please
uncle
what
birds
are
cannibals
asked
dodo
as
she
finished
writing
this
last
word
slowly
taking
great
pains
i
thought
cannibals
were
people
that
ate
each
other
well
my
dear
so
they
are
and
cannibal
birds
are
those
who
eat
each
other
if
you
please
doctor
which
of
the
birds
that
sing
will
you
begin
with
asked
rap
i
wonder
if
we
can
guess
it
you
may
all
try
said
the
doctor
it
is
a
bird
that
every
one
loves
the
home
bird
who
is
so
fond
of
house
people
that
whenever
we
see
one
we
know
that
there
is
a
house
not
far
away
then
it
must
be
the
bluebird
cried
rap
you
are
right
said
the
doctor
and
if
you
will
come
here
by
the
window
you
can
watch
a
pair
who
are
flying
in
and
out
of
the
bird
house
on
top
of
the
woodshed
do
you
hear
bluebirds
have
a
and
a
sweet
warbling
song
as
i
have
told
you
before
all
birds
have
some
note
or
sound
that
they
use
to
attract
attention
or
call
their
mates
but
it
is
only
those
whose
voices
are
so
highly
developed
that
they
can
make
really
continuous
musical
sounds
that
are
called
song
birds
the
male
is
the
only
real
singer
in
birdland
many
females
have
pretty
musical
notes
that
they
give
when
about
the
nest
and
some
scraps
of
song
one
or
two
are
quite
good
musicians
but
the
great
chorus
comes
from
the
males
these
have
their
seasons
for
singing
and
are
not
in
equal
voice
during
the
entire
year
they
sing
most
persistently
from
the
time
they
put
on
their
spring
coat
until
after
the
nesting
season
when
they
take
it
off
in
early
autumn
some
species
sing
for
a
time
and
in
warm
climates
there
is
more
or
less
music
all
winter
but
the
great
morning
and
evening
chorus
belongs
to
spring
and
the
nesting
season
it
is
as
rare
to
hear
the
perfect
song
of
a
bird
in
autumn
as
it
is
to
see
its
perfect
plumage
the
young
birds
of
the
season
are
then
swelling
their
little
throats
in
trying
to
warble
a
few
notes
and
as
their
feathers
are
a
mixture
of
those
worn
by
their
father
and
mother
such
birds
and
their
songs
will
both
most
likely
confuse
you
when
you
find
a
strange
bird
try
to
see
quickly
a
few
of
the
things
most
necessary
to
naming
him
i
will
make
a
measure
of
your
middle
finger
for
you
such
as
olive
used
to
wear
then
you
must
try
to
answer
the
following
questions
how
many
inches
long
was
he
what
was
his
general
color
was
his
breast
plain
or
speckled
what
was
he
doing
feeding
on
the
ground
or
in
a
tree
did
he
walk
with
one
foot
after
the
other
or
hop
with
both
feet
together
did
he
sing
or
only
call
at
first
you
may
only
remember
two
or
three
of
these
questions
and
they
will
probably
be
his
size
color
and
song
if
he
happens
to
be
singing
at
the
time
you
may
not
think
that
a
bird
who
is
hopping
about
in
the
grass
or
flitting
among
the
branches
of
a
tree
is
doing
anything
in
particular
but
really
he
may
be
either
collecting
material
for
his
nest
or
searching
for
food
of
some
particular
kind
in
a
way
which
will
tell
you
to
what
guild
of
the
bird
brotherhood
he
belongs
everything
in
the
daily
life
of
a
bird
is
interesting
you
will
find
that
every
bird
has
its
regular
times
for
bathing
pluming
eating
sleeping
working
and
playing
all
in
its
own
ways
just
as
you
yourselves
have
and
everything
he
does
is
done
cheerfully
and
promptly
i
know
that
you
think
this
a
very
long
sermon
and
that
you
would
rather
see
a
bird
than
be
told
how
to
see
it
only
one
word
more
i
am
going
to
give
you
as
we
go
along
a
few
facts
about
the
color
and
size
of
each
bird
that
you
may
write
in
your
books
so
that
if
you
forget
whether
this
bird
or
that
one
was
striped
or
spotted
you
can
look
at
your
table
not
multiplication
table
and
see
which
it
was
now
we
will
begin
with
our
dear
bluebird
chapter
ix
a
family
the
bluebird
it
will
be
difficult
for
you
to
mistake
this
little
for
any
other
bird
he
is
blue
which
is
as
rare
a
color
among
birds
its
it
is
among
flowers
he
is
the
of
birdland
also
and
loyally
floats
the
tricolor
from
our
trees
and
telegraph
wires
for
besides
being
blue
is
he
not
also
red
and
white
illustration
bluebird
to
be
sure
his
breast
is
perhaps
more
brown
than
red
but
when
the
spring
sun
shines
on
his
new
feathers
as
he
flits
to
and
fro
it
is
quite
bright
enough
to
be
called
red
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
people
love
and
respect
the
bluebird
all
welcome
him
to
their
gardens
and
orchards
the
grossest
old
farmer
with
his
back
bent
double
by
rheumatism
contrives
to
bore
some
auger
holes
in
an
old
box
and
fasten
it
on
the
side
of
the
barn
or
set
it
up
on
the
pole
of
his
hayrick
while
the
thrifty
villager
provides
a
beautiful
home
for
his
pets
a
real
summer
hotel
mounted
on
a
tall
post
above
a
with
gables
and
little
windows
under
the
eaves
why
does
this
bird
receive
so
much
attention
there
are
many
others
with
gayer
plumage
and
more
brilliant
songs
it
is
because
the
bluebird
is
gentle
useful
brave
and
faithful
under
adversity
while
he
and
the
robin
are
the
first
two
birds
that
children
know
by
name
we
must
live
in
a
very
cold
windswept
part
of
the
country
not
to
have
some
of
these
birds
with
us
from
march
until
thanksgiving
day
and
then
when
a
week
has
passed
and
we
have
not
seen
a
single
one
we
say
winter
has
come
in
earnest
when
weeks
go
by
and
our
eyes
grow
tired
of
the
glare
of
the
snow
or
our
hearts
discouraged
at
the
sight
of
bare
lifeless
trees
and
stretches
of
brown
meadow
suddenly
some
morning
we
hear
a
few
liquid
notes
from
an
old
tree
in
a
sunny
spot
all
eagerness
we
go
out
to
see
if
our
ears
have
deceived
us
no
it
is
a
bluebird
he
is
peeping
into
an
old
woodpecker
hole
and
acting
as
if
he
had
serious
thoughts
of
going
to
housekeeping
there
and
did
not
intend
waiting
to
move
in
until
either
when
you
see
him
you
may
know
that
though
there
is
still
ice
on
the
and
on
the
little
streams
spring
is
only
around
the
corner
waiting
for
her
friend
the
sun
to
give
her
a
little
warmer
invitation
to
join
him
in
their
old
old
play
of
turning
the
sluggish
sleeping
brown
earth
into
a
wonderful
green
garden
again
as
a
citizen
the
bluebird
is
in
every
way
a
model
he
works
with
the
ground
gleaners
in
searching
the
grass
and
low
bushes
for
grasshoppers
and
crickets
he
searches
the
trees
for
caterpillars
in
company
with
the
tree
trappers
and
in
eating
blueberries
cranberries
wild
grapes
and
other
fruits
he
works
with
the
seed
sowers
also
so
who
would
not
welcome
this
bird
who
pays
his
rent
and
taxes
in
so
cheerful
a
manner
and
thanks
you
with
a
song
into
the
bargain
a
very
few
straws
are
all
that
he
asks
for
his
housekeeping
and
every
time
he
promises
a
meal
for
his
household
scores
of
creeping
crawling
hopping
garden
enemies
are
gobbled
up
then
he
modest
little
fellow
that
he
is
comes
to
the
roof
of
the
shed
and
murmurs
his
thanks
for
your
hospitality
as
if
you
and
not
he
had
done
the
favor
he
continues
to
whisper
and
warble
about
it
all
the
way
down
the
meadow
until
having
caught
another
grasshopper
his
mouth
is
too
full
for
singing
as
the
doctor
was
speaking
the
shower
cloud
passed
over
and
the
sun
burst
out
full
upon
the
bluebirds
that
were
building
by
the
woodshed
oh
they
red
white
and
blue
cried
dodo
in
great
glee
though
the
red
is
a
little
dirty
not
so
fresh
and
bright
as
the
color
in
our
new
flag
it
is
more
the
red
of
the
ragged
old
flag
they
keep
down
in
the
town
hall
the
one
that
has
seen
service
said
rap
thoughtfully
some
things
to
remember
about
the
bluebird

of

american
robin
another
home
bird
first
cousin
to
the
bluebird
coming
with
it
in
the
spring
and
often
lingering
through
the
winter
in
places
that
the
bluebird
is
obliged
to
leave
the
robin
a
cousin
of
the
bluebird
interrupted
nat
why
they
look
one
bit
alike
how
can
it
be
uncle
roy
i
expected
you
to
ask
that
question
said
the
doctor
the
relationship
of
bird
families
like
that
of
other
animals
is
based
upon
a
likeness
in
the
formation
of
their
bodies
and
not
upon
mere
size
or
color
that
sort
of
likeness
proves
that
their
ancestors
of
long
ago
were
the
same
so
that
they
are
descended
from
one
pair
of
very
and
that
always
makes
cousins
you
know
it
runs
in
the
blood
thus
a
cat
and
a
tiger
are
blood
relations
the
little
coon
and
the
great
black
bear
are
nearly
akin
a
tall
man
with
black
hair
and
a
full
beard
may
have
a
cousin
who
is
short
and
thin
with
yellow
hair
and
no
beard
you
see
nothing
strange
in
this
because
it
is
something
to
which
you
are
accustomed
but
with
bird
families
it
takes
the
trained
eye
of
the
student
to
see
the
likeness
there
really
is
between
all
birds
who
have
had
the
same
ancestors
though
it
may
be
hidden
under
many
differences
in
their
size
shape
color
voice
and
habits
the
robin
like
the
bluebird
is
found
in
almost
all
parts
of
north
america
in
the
far
southern
states
like
florida
where
they
take
refuge
from
winter
storms
robins
begin
to
sing
in
chorus
while
the
weather
in
the
middle
and
northern
states
is
still
so
cold
that
it
would
freeze
the
music
before
any
one
could
hear
it
even
if
the
birds
had
courage
to
sing
but
delightful
as
the
climate
is
there
where
it
also
provides
a
plentiful
table
of
berries
these
robins
break
away
from
the
land
of
plenty
and
begin
their
northern
journey
before
the
first
shad
dares
venture
up
the
rivers
on
and
on
they
go
this
great
army
of
robins
flying
in
flocks
of
ten
and
hundreds
here
and
there
they
meet
with
smaller
flocks
which
have
been
able
to
spend
the
winter
in
roving
about
not
far
from
their
nesting
places
and
then
there
is
a
great
deal
of
talking
for
the
robin
has
a
great
many
ways
of
making
remarks
some
of
his
numerous
notes
sound
as
if
he
were
asking
a
long
list
of
questions
others
express
discontent
then
again
he
fumes
and
sputters
with
anger
it
is
easy
to
tell
the
plump
birds
just
home
from
the
south
from
those
who
have
been
obliged
to
live
on
half
rations
during
the
northern
winter
before
this
flying
army
quite
leaves
the
southern
states
some
of
them
halt
for
and
then
the
robin
sings
the
best
of
all
his
songs
his
happy
cheery
melody
all
about
the
earth
the
sky
the
sun
the
tree
he
and
his
mate
have
chosen
to
build
in
a
song
of
the
little
brook
where
he
means
to
get
the
water
to
wet
the
clay
to
plaster
his
nest
a
ballad
of
the
blue
eggs
it
will
hold
and
the
greedy
little
robins
all
eyes
and
mouth
that
will
come
out
of
them
but
as
he
sings
something
frightens
him
then
he
cries
quick
quick
and
hurries
away
in
a
rather
clumsy
fashion
if
any
one
could
understand
the
meaning
of
all
that
the
robin
says
and
put
it
into
our
words
we
should
be
able
to
make
a
very
good
dictionary
of
the
language
of
birdland
i
noticed
how
different
his
songs
are
said
rap
eagerly
and
how
some
of
his
ways
are
like
the
bluebird
too
we
had
a
robin
nest
last
season
in
the
grape
vine
over
the
back
door
and
i
used
to
watch
them
all
the
time
and
then
rap
hesitated
in
great
confusion
for
fear
that
he
had
been
impolite
in
stopping
the
doctor
tell
us
about
your
robins
my
boy
we
shall
like
to
hear
the
story
do
look
so
troubled
but
say
exactly
what
you
saw
them
do
rap
wriggled
about
a
little
then
settled
himself
comfortably
with
his
chin
resting
on
the
top
of
his
crutch
and
began
it
was
the
year
that
my
leg
was
hurt
the
miller
was
chopping
a
tree
and
it
fell
the
wrong
way
on
me
and
squeezed
my
leg
so
that
it
could
be
mended
so
i
was
around
home
all
the
time
it
was
a
terribly
cold
day
when
the
robins
came
back
along
in
the
first
part
of
march
if
it
had
been
for
the
robins
anybody
would
have
thought
it
was
january
but
in
january
we
do
have
big
robin
flocks
about
here
only
just
twos
and
threes
that
pick
round
the
alder
bushes
and
old
honeysuckles
for
berries
it
was
such
a
cold
day
that
the
clothes
froze
to
the
line
so
that
mother
could
take
them
off
and
we
did
know
what
to
do
well
we
were
looking
at
them
mother
and
i
when
a
big
robin
flew
out
of
the
pine
trees
and
hopped
along
the
as
if
he
wanted
to
speak
to
us
he
hungry
said
mother
guess
he
is
said
i
ground
is
too
hard
for
worms
to
come
out
so
he
ca
get
any
of
them
ca
i
give
him
some
of
the
dried
huckleberries
we
always
dry
a
lot
every
summer
so
as
to
have
pies
in
winter
mother
said
i
might
so
i
scattered
some
on
the
snow
under
the
pine
trees
and
we
went
in
the
house
and
peeped
out
of
the
kitchen
window
at
first
the
robins
chattered
and
talked
for
a
while
looking
at
the
berries
but
then
the
bird
that
came
on
the
started
down
and
began
to
eat
how
did
you
know
that
robin
from
all
the
others
asked
dodo
he
had
lost
the
two
longest
quills
out
of
his
right
wing
and
so
he
flew
sort
of
said
rap
readily
as
soon
as
he
began
the
others
came
down
and
just
gobbled
in
two
minutes
all
the
berries
were
gone
but
the
birds
stayed
round
all
the
same
hinting
for
more
we
had
many
berries
left
so
mother
said
if
they
will
eat
meal
i
mixed
some
meal
in
a
pan
with
hot
water
and
spread
it
in
little
puddles
on
the
snow
the
robins
acted
real
mad
at
first
because
it
berries
but
after
a
while
one
pecked
at
it
and
told
the
others
it
was
all
right
and
then
thirty
robins
all
sat
in
a
row
and
ate
that
meal
up
the
same
as
if
they
were
chickens
here
rap
paused
and
laughed
at
the
thought
of
the
strange
sight
pretty
soon
after
that
the
snow
melted
and
by
april
robins
were
building
around
in
our
yard
in
the
maples
by
the
road
and
all
through
this
orchard
one
day
i
noticed
some
little
twigs
and
a
splash
of
mud
on
our
back
steps
and
when
i
looked
up
i
saw
that
something
was
building
a
nest
in
the
crotch
of
the
old
grape
vine
a
queer
place
for
a
nest
i
said
to
myself
a
leaf
on
the
vine
and
my
window
right
on
top
i
wonder
what
silly
bird
is
doing
it
flap
and
my
robin
with
the
broken
feathers
came
along
with
his
mouth
full
of
sticks
but
when
he
saw
me
he
dropped
them
and
went
over
on
the
and
called
and
scolded
like
everything
then
i
went
up
to
my
window
and
looked
through
the
blind
slats
next
day
the
nest
was
done
it
was
a
pretty
nest
robins
never
are
they
are
heavy
and
lumpy
and
often
fall
off
the
branches
when
a
long
rain
wets
them
this
one
seemed
quite
comfortable
inside
and
was
lined
with
soft
grass
robin
looked
like
her
husband
but
i
could
tell
the
difference
for
she
did
sit
in
the
pines
and
sing
and
her
breast
was
so
red
when
the
nest
was
done
she
laid
a
beautiful
egg
every
day
until
there
were
four
and
then
one
or
the
other
of
the
birds
sat
on
the
eggs
all
the
time
robins
eggs
are
a
queer
color
not
just
blue
or
quite
green
but
something
between
all
of
their
own
yes
said
olive
it
is
their
own
color
and
we
give
it
a
name
for
it
is
called
blue
in
our
books
the
old
birds
had
been
sitting
for
ten
days
and
it
was
almost
time
for
the
little
ones
to
come
out
when
one
night
there
was
a
great
wind
and
the
grape
vine
that
was
only
fastened
up
with
bits
of
leather
and
tacks
fell
down
in
a
heap
in
the
morning
there
was
the
nest
all
in
a
tangle
of
vine
down
on
the
ground
the
vine
must
have
swung
down
for
it
had
tipped
the
nest
over
and
the
mother
bird
was
sitting
on
it
still
will
never
do
said
my
mother
first
cat
that
strays
by
will
take
the
poor
thing
while
i
was
looking
at
it
mother
went
in
the
house
and
came
back
with
a
little
tin
pail
she
picked
some
branches
and
tied
them
round
it
so
that
the
tin
did
show
she
said
to
the
robin
the
same
as
if
it
understood
our
language
up
and
let
me
see
if
i
ca
better
you
a
bit
then
the
bird
left
the
nest
making
a
great
fuss
and
crying
quick
as
if
all
the
woods
were
afire
mother
i
cried
eggs
will
get
cold
what
are
you
taking
the
nest
away
for
it
was
better
to
chance
the
cats
you
fret
sonny
said
she
mammy
has
some
common
sense
if
she
do
trampoose
all
over
creation
watching
birds
and
before
i
understood
what
she
was
doing
she
had
put
the
nest
in
the
top
of
the
tin
pail
and
hung
it
on
a
hook
under
the
shed
roof
she
said
robin
try
how
you
like
that
i
watched
and
after
a
few
minutes
first
one
robin
flew
under
the
shed
and
then
the
other
and
the
next
thing
one
was
sitting
on
the
as
nice
as
you
please
did
the
birds
hatch
asked
olive
nat
and
dodo
almost
in
the
same
breath
yes
they
hatched
all
right
and
then
i
noticed
something
funny
the
backs
and
breasts
of
the
little
birds
were
almost
naked
when
they
were
hatched
and
their
eyes
closed
tight
but
when
the
feathers
came
they
were
spotted
on
their
backs
and
breasts
and
not
plain
like
their
parents
do
you
know
added
rap
after
a
little
pause
that
when
bluebirds
are
little
their
backs
and
breasts
are
speckled
too
though
afterward
they
moult
out
plain
so
there
is
something
alike
about
bluebirds
and
robins
that
even
a
boy
can
see
you
are
quite
right
said
the
doctor
the
alike
that
even
a
boy
can
see
is
one
of
the
things
that
shows
these
birds
to
be
cousins
as
i
told
you
every
one
of
the
family
is
spotted
when
it
gets
its
first
feathers
it
is
strange
he
added
in
an
undertone
as
if
talking
to
himself
how
long
it
took
some
of
us
to
find
out
what
any
bright
boy
can
see
the
american
robin
remember
this
length
ten
inches
upper
parts
slate
color
with
a
tinge
of
brown
head
black
on
top
and
sides
with
white
spots
around
the
eyes
tail
black
with
white
spots
on
the
tips
of
some
feathers
under
parts
except
the
black
and
white
streaked
throat
and
under
the
tail
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
canada
a
ground
gleaner
tree
trapper
and
seed
sower
the
wood
thrush
one
pleasant
evening
after
tea
but
before
sunset
the
doctor
sent
nat
to
ask
rap
to
come
up
to
the
farm
as
they
were
all
going
for
a
walk
through
the
orchard
and
the
river
woods
what
birds
will
you
tell
us
about
asked
dodo
as
they
stood
in
the
porch
waiting
for
the
boys
cousins
of
the
bluebird
more
cousins
but
really
the
heads
of
the
family
they
wear
much
plainer
clothes
than
the
bluebirds
and
robins
on
their
olive
or
backs
and
breasts
but
have
the
most
beautiful
voices
in
all
birdland
the
names
of
these
wonderful
singers
who
make
a
musical
quartette
are
wood
thrush
hermit
thrush
wilson
thrush
and
thrush
but
you
will
have
to
keep
both
your
eyes
and
ears
open
to
learn
to
tell
them
apart
and
name
them
rightly
there
has
been
the
beautifullest
bird
singing
in
the
big
elm
on
the
lawn
for
more
than
an
hour
but
i
do
know
his
name
and
i
want
to
ever
so
much
do
you
think
he
might
be
one
of
these
thrushes
he
is
singing
now
uncle
roy
and
dodo
began
tugging
at
the
doctor
hand
to
lead
him
down
the
steps
they
saw
nat
and
rap
coming
along
the
road
and
the
doctor
motioned
to
them
to
walk
quietly
so
that
dodo
bird
might
continue
his
song
what
is
it
what
are
you
waiting
for
whispered
nat
a
bird
where
the
bird
answered
nat
question
itself
telling
him
by
its
song
in
what
part
of
the
tree
it
was
perching
it
called
and
then
followed
a
short
song
as
if
two
musical
instruments
were
playing
together
the
bird
seemed
well
pleased
with
his
performance
and
perfectly
unconscious
of
the
group
of
house
people
who
were
listening
to
him
for
he
repeated
the
strain
over
and
over
again
it
almost
as
big
as
a
robin
said
dodo
but
its
breast
is
speckled
in
big
spots
said
nat
i
wish
i
could
see
the
top
of
it
there
it
has
flown
to
a
lower
branch
and
its
back
is
kind
of
what
is
its
name
uncle
roy
rap
knows
i
sure
said
the
doctor
it
a
wood
thrush
said
rap
people
call
them
wood
robins
too
sometimes
i
think
that
one
or
his
brother
has
a
nest
in
the
spruce
back
of
your
house
sang
the
thrush
and
as
the
children
became
accustomed
to
the
song
they
noticed
that
six
or
eight
other
were
singing
the
same
tune
in
different
parts
of
the
orchard
and
garden
it
sounded
as
if
the
evening
breeze
were
stirring
aeolian
harps
why
is
he
called
the
wood
thrush
asked
rap
i
hardly
ever
seen
him
in
the
real
woods
he
loves
to
be
in
gardens
and
orchards
the
trees
round
the
miller
house
are
full
of
them
it
is
not
easy
to
say
why
he
was
named
so
said
the
doctor
unless
it
is
because
he
builds
his
nest
higher
up
in
trees
than
most
of
his
thrush
kin
i
am
very
glad
you
have
had
a
chance
to
hear
and
see
him
at
the
same
time
for
he
is
one
of
the
home
birds
you
must
make
a
place
for
in
your
very
inside
heart
with
the
bluebird
and
robin
though
he
does
not
return
from
his
winter
outing
until
after
these
two
have
begun
nesting
illustration
wood
thrush
when
he
comes
we
are
sure
not
only
that
it
is
spring
but
that
spring
is
in
a
pleasant
mood
that
she
is
through
with
the
tempers
and
crying
fits
she
suffers
from
in
march
and
april
and
is
kissing
the
buds
of
the
early
blossoms
of
may
coaxing
them
to
open
their
eyes
when
you
see
the
first
wood
thrush
hopping
among
last
leaves
you
may
look
for
pointed
nose
and
green
and
purple
hood
as
soon
as
this
thrush
makes
up
his
mind
to
settle
in
a
certain
place
he
calls
a
mate
to
him
with
his
thrilling
song
and
begins
from
this
time
until
he
moults
late
in
july
every
one
in
his
vicinity
may
enjoy
a
free
concert
morning
and
evening
and
at
intervals
during
the
day
sometimes
in
cloudy
weather
he
even
sings
at
noon
a
time
when
birds
are
most
likely
to
be
silent
in
gratitude
for
what
we
owe
him
for
his
music
and
his
work
in
the
guilds
we
must
be
patient
with
him
when
he
secures
the
first
ripe
cherries
from
the
top
of
the
tree
before
we
house
people
know
that
they
are
even
red
for
every
cherry
and
strawberry
he
bites
he
pays
ten
times
over
by
swallowing
a
hundred
wicked
hungry
worms
and
bugs
that
eat
everything
and
do
no
work
in
return
but
house
people
are
very
blind
about
some
things
and
often
act
as
if
they
had
only
one
eye
apiece
like
the
cyclopes
we
see
one
of
these
darling
birds
take
a
little
fruit
we
see
more
fruit
with
holes
in
it
and
think
that
birds
have
done
the
damage
though
a
wasp
or
hornet
may
be
the
guilty
party
and
then
we
often
say
a
nuisance
those
birds
are
but
all
the
rest
of
the
growing
year
when
these
same
birds
toil
from
sunrise
until
sunset
to
clear
away
insect
pests
and
give
us
a
better
crop
of
fruit
next
year
we
do
not
notice
it
you
children
however
will
have
no
such
excuse
for
keeping
one
eye
shut
when
you
know
citizen

as
he
really
is
how
late
at
night
does
the
wood
thrush
sing
asked
nat
does
he
never
sleep
oh
yes
he
goes
to
sleep
when
it
is
really
dark
but
at
this
nesting
season
the
night
in
birdland
is
very
short
some
of
the

people
are
stirring

by

dressed
themselves

the

singing
down

perhaps
we
had
better
go
there
before
it
grows

is
that
what
you
call
those
birds
asked
rap
i
never
knew
their
name
so
i
called
them
birds
to
myself
veeries
yes
but
called
wilson
thrush
too
said
the
doctor
because
this
kind
of
thrush
was
named
after
alexander
wilson
who
wrote
a
description
of
it
and
published
a
colored
plate
of
it
years
ago
but
your
name
of
bird
is
very
good
my
lad
for
they
sing
best
about
twilight
we
will
go
down
to
the
river

and
hear
them
though
you
can
not
see

they
walked
along

wound
in

out
among

were
skimming
close
to

sang
a

song
to
itself

it
ran
along

they
are
barn
swallows
who
catch
flies
and
little
gnats
and
things
close
down
over
the
water
hear
them
talking
and
laughing
but
the
swallows
really
seemed
to
be
playing
some
sort
of
game
as
they
circled
about
every
now
and
then
turning
sharply
and
giving
little
rippling
cries
the
doctor
halted
under
a
beech
tree
that
spread
its
branches
over
a
great
mossy
circle
seating
himself
on
an
old
log
that
had
been
washed
down
the
river
and
lay
on
the
ground
for
a
minute
the
veeries
were
silent
then
from
the
tree
over
his
head
one
sang
a
short
tune
two
sentences
in
a
high
key
then
two
a
little
lower
and
softer
like
an
echo
it
is
different
from
any
other
said
olive
and
every
spring
when
it
comes
it
seems
as
lovely
as
the
first
time
i
heard
it
is
that
veery
only
visiting
here
or
will
he
build
a
nest
asked
nat
he
will
build
and
though
he
is
so
shy
that
we
do
not
see
him
as
often
as
the
wood
thrush
his
song
makes
him
one
of
the
of
the
family
he
makes
his
home
from
the
middle
states
east
and
west
all
over
the
country
up
to
the
far
north
but
as
insects
are
his
chief
food
he
does
not
come
as
early
or
stay
as
late
in
his
summer
home
as
the
hermit
thrush
and
always
tries
to
reach
the
warmer
countries
before
the
trees
are
wholly
bare
and
there
is
danger
of
snow
do
they
live
up
in
the
trees
where
they
sing
asked
dodo
after
they
had
listened
to
the
veeries
who
were
then
singing
on
both
sides
of
the
river
no
on
the
contrary
he
is
one
of
the
ground
thrushes
who
builds
his
nest
close
to
the
ground
in
such
places
as
that
bit
of
brushwood
opposite
and
as
he
spends
most
of
his
time
about
home
we
seldom
see
him
even
in
places
like
this
where
many
pairs
live
but
we
do
not
need
to
see
a
veery
to
know
of
his
presence
if
we
once
learn
his
song
by
heart
because
we
shall
remember
it
as
long
as
our
hearts
beat
the
children
sat
silent
for
a
long

when

said
the

i
will
show
you
the
veery
and
hermit
thrush
also
for
whether
or
not
you
will
hear
the
hermit
sing
will
depend
very
much
upon
what
part
of
north
america
you
live
or
travel
in
and
this
bird
song
is
its
chief
claim
to
fame
through
all
the
southern
and
middle
parts
of
the
states
he
only
pays
visits
during
the
fall
winter
and
early
spring
at
these
seasons
he
rarely
sings
and
spends
his
time
in
hopping
about
the
underbrush
searching
for
insects
in
spring
and
autumn
you
will
see
him
about
the
magnolia
trees
in
your
yard
or
garden
or
in
the
hedges
along
roads
and
the
edges
of
light
woods
where
wild
berries
are
plentiful
the
name
of
hermit
would
naturally
make
you
expect
to
find
a
very
shy
bird
but
he
is
not
only
he
likes
his
own
company
in
secret
places
when
on
his
travels
unlike
most
birds
and
like
all
good
children
in
story
books
he
is
oftener
seen
than
heard
at
this
time
you
must
look
for
him
on
or
near
the
ground
for
he
is
a
famous
ground
gleaner
at
first
you
may
mistake
him
for
a
wood
thrush
but
look
again
he
is
smaller
the
spots
on
the
breast
are
more
joined
together
like
stripes
the
rump
and
tail
are
a
very
like
ripe
chestnuts
different
from
the
on
the
back
and
head
you
will
be
sure
to
notice
this
for
the
hermit
jerks
his
tail
about
when
he
feeds
on
the
ground
giving
a
little
warning
call
that
sounds
like

illustration
hermit
thrush
if
you
should
happen
to
spend
the
summer
among
the
mountains
of
new
york
new
england
or
northern
michigan
and
see
the
hermit
in
his
nesting
home
you
would
find
him
quite
another
character
true
to
his
name
there
he
is
shy
or
perhaps
cautious
would
be
a
better
word
to
describe
the
way
in
which
he
keeps
the
secrets
of
his
precious
nest
he
loves
the
little
moist
valleys
between
the
mountains
where
a
bit
of
light
woods
is
made
an
island
by
the
soft
that
surrounds
it
there
feeling
quite
secure
he
makes
his
nest
upon
the
ground
of
moss
leaves
and
other
such
litter
and
the
eggs
that
it
holds
are
very
nearly
the
color
of
the
robin
without
any
spots
he
goes
a
little
way
from
home
a
bit
up
the
mountain
side
so
that
house
people
and
squirrels
both
of
whom
are
sometimes
cruel
enough
to
steal
eggs
may
not
know
exactly
where
he
lives
and
then
he
begins
to
sing
his
brother
thrushes
have
louder
voices
and
know
more
brilliant
songs
but
when
the
hermit
reaches
his
high
notes
that
sound
as
clear
as
the
music
of
a
mountain
brook
a
strange
feeling
will
suddenly
come
over
you
you
will
forget
that
you
belong
to
house
people
and
that
he
is
a
bird
you
will
think
he
is
telling
you
something
in
words
that
you
understand
a
message
that
makes
you
think
about
pure
and
holy
things
the
songs
of
some
birds
please
the
ear
alone
but
this
little
brown
hermit
sings
to
your
conscience
some
call
him
the
spirit
of
the
pines
if
however
you
never
hear
his
song
you
can
remember
that
the
hermit
is
the
brown
bird
with
the
rusty
tail
and
speckled
breast
that
hops
among
your
bushes
in
spring
and
fall
you
must
be
very
kind
to
him
and

about

prefers
a
cool

climate
and
thinks
that
the
mountains
agree
with
his
health
much
better
than
the
seashore
for
this
reason
he
makes
his
home
all
through

what

he

out

moss
bark
and
rootlets
to
see
moose
browsing
among
the
young
trees
and
hears
black
bears
growling
his

companions
are

and
he
trembles
lest
the

shall
find

much
as
he
loves

weather
for
he
tires
of
it
when
the
first
frost
touches
the
valleys
and
snow
caps
the
tops
of
his
favorite
mountains
for
then
his

food
grows
scarce
so
he
changes
his
summer
habits
leaving
the
guild
of
ground
gleaners
and
becoming
a

sower
he
follows
the
sun
toward
the

where
likely
enough
he
tells

tales
of
northern

and
assures
the
that

he
is

you
may
more
often
than
see
he
is
a
for
shyness
whether
on
his
journeys
or
about
home
but
remember
three
things
about
him
his
back
is
evenly
olive
if
you
do
not
know
what
this
color
is
look
at
the
olives
you
have
on
the
table
or
that
stand
in
the
tall
glass
jars
in
the
grocer
window
for
if
you
wish
to
study
birds
you
must
learn
to
distinguish
this
color
from
brown
or
the
bright
green
he
has
a
ring
round
his
eye
and
lastly
his
throat
and
breast
are
dull
yellowish
wo
you
let
us
go
up
to
the
wonder
room
now
and
see
all
these
thrush
cousins
in
a
row
asked
nat
when
the
doctor
had
finished
describing
them
we
will
go
up
to
the
house
and
you
may
take
a
look
at
them
but
i
want
you
to
be
also
able
to
name
them
from
what
i
tell
you
for
when
you
see
a
bird
out
of
doors
you
will
seldom
be
able
to
have
a
stuffed
one
with
which
to
compare
it
now
we
will
make
a
procession
of
these
cousins
said
the
doctor
as
they
reached
his
study
he
then
opened
a
glass
case
took
out
six
birds
and
stood
them
on
the
see
this
is
the
way
they
go
arm
in
arm
when
they
walk
in
the
great
procession
of
bird
families
the
bluebird
and
the
robin
the
wood
thrush
and
the
veery
the
hermit
and
the
rap
my
boy
look
at
each
one
and
see
if
you
can
remember
some
of
the
differences
between
them
now
shut
your
eyes
and
think
what
has
the
bluebird
a
blue
back
and
a
red
and
white
breast
it
is
the
flag
bird
the
robin
a
breast
and
dark
back
the
wood
thrush
a
back
the
brightest
on
the
head
and

to
tail

back

redder

the
rump

the
kinglet
we
have
been
looking
at
some
of
the
larger
song
birds
now
try
the
sharpness
of
your
eyes
by
finding
a
tiny
little
fellow
a
veritable
midget
who
belongs
to
the
guild
of
tree
trappers
he
is
usually
intent
upon
his
work
continually
hopping
and
peeping
among
little
branches
and
twigs
and
thinks
it
would
be
time
wasted
if
he
stayed
still
long
enough
to
give
you
a
chance
to
look
at
him
he
is
so
small
that
there
are
very
few
north
american
birds
to
compare
with
him
in
littleness
the
hummingbird
is
smaller
still
and
the
winter
wren
measures
no
more
only
he
is
chunkier
but
what
of
that
this
kinglet
is
as
hardy
and
vigorous
as
the
biggest
hawk
or
owl
his
body
is
padded
with
a
thick
feather
overcoat
that
enables
him
to
stay
all
winter
if
he
chooses
in
all
but

illustration
kinglet
small
as
he
is
however
every
one
knows
him
for
he
disports
himself
at
some
time
of
the
year
in
the
north
south
east
and
west
if
you
see
a
tiny
bird
darting
quick
as
a
mouse
in
and
out
among
the
budded
twigs
of
fruit
trees
in
early
spring
now
and
then
showing
a
black
stripe
and
a
little
gleam
of
red
or
yellow
on
its
head
it
is
this
kinglet
if
you
see
such
a
pygmy
again
in
autumn
exploring
the
bare
twigs
it
is
this
kinglet
when
light
snow
is
first
powdering
the
spruces
and
bending
the
delicate
hemlock
branches
dusky
shapes
flit
out
of
the
green
cover
are
they
dry
leaves
blown
about
by
the
gust
no
leaves
do
not
climb
about
in
the
face
of
the
wind
or
pry
and
peep
into
every
cone
crevice
crying
they
are
not
leaves
but
a
flock
of
kinglets
forcing
the
bark
crevices
to
yield
them
a
breakfast
of
the
insects
which
had
put
themselves
comfortably
to
bed
for
the
winter
think
of
the
work
that
these
birds
do
who
not
only
fight
the
insect
army
in
summer
but
in
sleet
and
snow
are
as
busy
as
ever
destroying
the
eggs
that
would
turn
in
another
season
to
worms
and
eat
the
orchards
though
the
kinglets
rove
about
in
flocks
a
great
part
of
the
year
they
are
extremely
private
in
the
nesting
season
they
go
to
northern
and
high
places
to
hide
their
homes
putting
them
as
far
out
of
reach
as
does
the
baltimore
oriole
this
nest
is
made
of
moss
and
seems
very
large
when
compared
with
the
size
of
the
builder
it
is
partly
hung
from
the
concealing
bough
of
an
evergreen
sometimes
quite
near
the
ground
sometimes
swinging
far
up
out
of
sight
does
this
kinglet
lay
two
little
white
eggs
like
the
hummingbird
asked
nat
no
said
the
doctor
this
sturdy
bird
lays
eight
or
ten
white
eggs
with
brown
spots
ten
eggs
cried
dodo
how
can
it
sit
on
them
all
at
once
and
keep
them
warm
enough
to
hatch
perhaps
the
birds
stir
the
eggs
up
every
day
to
give
them
all
an
even
chance
said
rap
it
is
possible
that
they
may
said
the
doctor
but
that
is
one
of
many
things
about
home
life
in
birdland
that
we
do
not
know
there
is
one
thing
more
that
i
must
tell
you
here
lest
you
make
a
mistake
about
the
kinglet
he
has
a
twin
brother
so
much
like
himself
that
their
own
parents
can
hardly
tell
them
apart
without
looking
at
the
tops
of
their
heads
the
other
twin
name
is
for
he
has
a
beautiful
little
crest
of
that
color
half
hidden
in
dark
greenish
but
not
any
of
the
black
and
yellow
marks
on
the
head
that
will
always
enable
you
to
recognize
the
if
you
can
get
a
chance
to
see
them
while
the
little
fellow
is
fidgeting
about
it
is
a
snug
family
that
contains
these
two
birdlets
for
there
is
only
one
other
member
of
it
in
all
this
part
of
the
world
and
you
will
not
be
likely
to
see
him
about
orchard
farm
the
kinglet
length
four
inches
upper
parts
browner
on
the
wings
and

which
have
some
yellowish
edgings
a
stripe
on
the
crown
bordered
by
a
yellow
and
then
by
a
black
line
but

birds
and
females
have
only
the
yellow
and
black
stripes
without
any
red
under

without
any
marks
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
a
tree
trapper
the
nuthatch
yank
says
the
nuthatch
as
he
runs
up
and
comes
down
again
head
foremost
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
illustration
nuthatch
at
first
or
from
a
distance
you
may
mistake
him
for
his
cousin
the
chickadee
who
wears
clothes
of
much
the
same
color
and
is
seen
in
the
same
places
or
perhaps
for
the
little
downy
woodpecker
who
also
hammers
his
insect
food
out
of
the
tree
bark
but
at
a
second
glance
you
will
find
the
nuthatch
is
very
different
he
keeps
his
body
very
close
to
the
tree
and
uses
his
feet
to
creep
about
like
a
mouse
or
chipmunk
he
also
goes
upside
down
in
a
way
that
woodpeckers
never
do
clings
to
the
under
side
of
a
branch
as
easily
as
a
fly
to
the
ceiling
and
often
roosts
or
takes
a
nap
head
downward
on
the
side
of
a
a
position
that
would
seem
likely
to
give
him
a
severe
headache
if
birds
ever
have
such
things
this
is
the
bird
i
saw
the
first
day
i
went
to
the
orchard
with
olive
but
why
is
he
called
a
nuthatch
asked
nat
because
besides
liking
to
eat
insects
and
their
grubs
or
their
eggs
he
is
also
very
fond
of
some
kinds
of
nuts
like
beech
and
chestnuts
said
the
doctor
and
he
may
be
obliged
to
live
entirely
upon
them
in
winter
when
insects
fail
him
having
no
teeth
to
gnaw
and
crack
them
open
as
squirrels
do
he
takes
a
nut
in
his
claws
and
either
holding
it
thus
or
jamming
it
tight
into
a
crack
in
the
bark
then
uses
his
bill
for
a
hatchet
to
split
or
hack
the
nut
open
i
have
seen
the
bird
crack
hard
nuts
in
this
way
that
it
would
take
very
strong
teeth
to
break
people
used
to
call
him
or
these
words
mean
exactly
the
same
thing
but
we
always
say
now
then
there
are
nuthatches
up
in
the
hickory
woods
said
rap
but
i
never
knew
their
real
name
until
now
for
the
miller
calls
them
creepers
last
summer
i
found
one
of
their
nests
when
i
was
looking
for
it
either
do
they
build
here
asked
olive
i
thought
they
only
visited
us
in
winter
i
do
remember
ever
hearing
one
sing
or
seeing
one
in
late
spring
or
summer
they
live
and
nest
everywhere
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
country
said
the
doctor
but
they
are
very
silent
and
shy
except
in
the
autumn
and
winter
in
fact
this
nuthatch
keeps
his
nest
a
secret
from
everybody
but
his
wife
and
the
dryad
of
the
tree
in
which
he
places
it
he
will
not
even
trust
the
little
branches
with
his
precious
home
but
makes
it
in
the
wood
of
the
tree
itself
you
say
rap
that
you
found
one
of
these
nests
wo
you
tell
us
about
it
it
was
this
way
said
rap
i
was
up
in
a
hickory
tree
trying
to
look
over
into
a
woodpecker
hole
that
was
in
another
tree
when
i
stepped
on
a
stumpy
branch
that
was
rotten
and
partly
broke
off
and
there
inside
was
a
soft
nest
made
of
feathers
with
four
very
little
birds
in
it
i
was
afraid
they
would
fall
out
but
there
was
enough
of
the
branch
left
to
hold
them
in
while
i
was
wondering
what
sort
of
birds
they
were
the
father
and
mother
came
running
along
a
branch
above
and
gave
me
a
terrible
scolding
so
pretty
soon
i
slid
down
and
left
them
how
they
did
squeak
and
rap
laughed
at
the
remembrance
of
it
they
have
not
very
musical
voices
at
best
said
the
doctor
even
their
spring
song
is
a
rather
husky
performance
is
that
a
nuthatch
now
asked
nat
there
hanging
to
the
end
tassel
of
the
big
spruce
and
a
lot
more
above
do
come
and
look
olive
no
nattie
they
are
the
chickadees
that
father
said
a
moment
ago
you
might
mistake
for
nuthatches

i
see
them
of
them
almost
screamed
dodo
growing
so
excited
that
nat
and
olive
each
grabbed
one
of
her
hands
to
keep
her
from
clapping
them
and
so
driving
the
chickadees
away
i
never
saw
a
strange
new
bird
so
near
by
explained
dodo
and
if
my
eye
was
only
a
photograph
machine
i
could
take
his
picture
illustration
chickadee
you
can
make
a
instead
by
telling
us
how
the
bird
appears
to
you
said
the
doctor
in
a
low
voice
but
you
need
not
whisper
for
whispering
is
an
unnatural
use
of
the
voice
it
makes
birds
and
other
people
suspicious
and
is
more
likely
to
attract
attention
than
a
quiet
low
tone
that
is
what
mother
said
when
she
was
sick
last
winter
and
the
neighbors
came
in
to
sit
with
her
if
they
talked
softly
she
stayed
asleep
and
did
mind
but
if
they
whispered
she
said
she
dreamed
that
the
room
was
full
of
geese
hissing
and
always
waked
up
frightened
said
nat
the
chickadees
did
not
mind
the
conversation
in
the
least
but
kept
on
flitting
in
and
out
of
the
spruces
swinging
from
the
little
pink
buds
that
would
grow
into
cones
by
and
by
doing
a
dozen
pretty
tricks
and
all
the
time
calling
as
if
they
were
repeating
a
joke
among
themselves
they
mean
we
shall
know
their
name
anyway
said
nat
have
they
any
other
song
oh
yes
some
nice
little
like
this
said
rap
and
if
you
whistle
back
they
answer
done
it
lots
of
times
try
now
do
rap
and
see
if
they
will
answer
begged
dodo
it
too
open
out
here
but
i
will
go
back
of
the
trees
and
perhaps
they
will
answer
i
heard
one
whistling
in
there
a
minute
ago
the
children
listened
and
presently
came
two
high
notes
from
among
the
trees
they
were
answered
by
two
others
very
musical
but
a
little
bit
sad
so
the
duet
went
on
boy
and
bird
until
dodo
and
nat
lost
count
and
could
not
tell
which
was
which
then
the
music
stopped
and
rap
returned
laughing
saying
that
when
the
chickadee
found
out
it
was
not
another
bird
that
he
was
calling
to
he
was
vexed
and
flew
away
some
chickadees
lived
around
our
house
all
last
winter
continued
rap
and
used
to
eat
out
of
the
chickens
dish
i
watched
them
every
day
but
one
that
was
terribly
windy
and
then
they
stayed
under
the
even
strong
winter
birds
do
like
the
wind
much
do
they
doctor
no
my
lad
wind
is
one
of
the
greatest
enemies
that
a
bird
has
a
hardy
bird
who
has
plenty
to
eat
can
endure
bitter
cold
but
when
the
is
scanty
as
it
often
is
in
winter
and
the
trees
are
covered
with
snow
and
ice
life
is
a
battle
with
the
bird
people
then
if
a
high
wind
is
added
to
all
this
discomfort
their
strength
gives
way
and
they
often
die
in
great
numbers
if
people
who
own
gardens
and
farms
where
there
are
no
evergreen
trees
or
hayricks
for
birds
to
hide
in
would
put
up
each
fall
little
shelters
of
brush
and
branches
they
would
save
a
great
many
and
their
orchards
would
be
freer
from
insects
in
the
spring
but
dodo
you
are
not
painting
the
of
the
chickadee
have
you
watched
them
long
enough
to
think
it
out
i
believe
i
have
said
dodo
slowly
i
see
a
dear
little
bird
about
as
big
as
a
chippy
sparrow
only
fatter
and
he
is
nice
soft
gray
on
top
about
the
color
of
my
chinchilla
muff
he
has
a
black
cap
on
his
head
that
comes
down
behind
where
his
ears
ought
to
be
fastened
with
a
wide
black
strap
across
his
throat
and
his
face
is
a
very
clean
white
and
his
breast
too
that
is
it
is
white
in
the
middle
but
the
sides
and
below
are
a
warmer
color
sort
of
rusty
white
and
that
all
except
that
he
as
fidgety
as
ever
he
can
be
ended
dodo
quite
out
of
breath
with
her
haste
to
tell
all
she
could
before
the
bird
flew
away
do
you
think
you
will
remember
the
chickadee
while
he
is
in
the
deep
woods
nesting
this
summer
so
that
you
will
know
him
again
in
the
autumn
dodo
and
nat
said
they
were
quite
sure
they
would
but
rap
said
known
him
ever
so
long
only
the
miller
called
him
a
titmouse
is
he
a
relation
of
the
nuthatch
doctor
yes
a
second
cousin
and
titmouse
is
one
of
his
right
names
they
used
to
belong
to
the
very
same
family
but
they
had
a
little
falling
out
and
are
not
now
so
intimate
as
they
were
before
each
went
his
own
way
and
acquired
some
different
habits
i
thought
they
were
alike
in
a
good
many
things
said

and
their
nests
are
something
alike

you

to
keep

given

would

may
catch

object
moving

before

made
up

have
gone
round

has

habit
that
will
some
day
give
you
a
good
chance
to
look
at
him
when
he
wishes
to
remain
still
a
moment
he
spreads
his
tail
with
its
stiff
pointed
feathers
and
props
himself
by
it
against
the
tree
this
is
your
opportunity
does
the
creeper
stay
here
all
summer
asked
nat
and
does
he
sing
a
song
like
the
other
birds
when
he
makes
his
nest
he
is
not
a
citizen
hereabouts
he
likes
a
cooler
climate
and
makes
his
home
near
and
across
the
northern
border
of
the
united
states
we
shall
see
him
in
the
autumn
when
he
has
become
a
wanderer
through
the
country
if
the
trees
are
not
coated
with
ice
a
little
flock
may
stay
here
all
winter
while
others
drift
further
south
then
we
sha
hear
him
sing
or
see
his
nest
have
you
ever
seen
it
uncle
roy
yes
my
boy
and
it
was
the
beauty
of
his
little
song
that
made
me
stop
one
day
in
going
through
an
old
pine
wood
and
search
for
the
singer
the
song
was
very
strange
and
wild
unlike
any
other
i
had
ever
heard
as
my
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
the
dim
light
i
saw
that
my
old
friend
the
brown
creeper
was
the
musician
at
the
same
time
he
flew
to
one
of
the
pine
trees
and
seemed
to
disappear
inside
of
it
i
watched
awhile
until
the
bird
flew
out
and
climbing
to
the
spot
saw
that
the
nest
was
squeezed
in
a
sort
of
pocket
between
the
loose
bark
and
the
tree
itself
you
see
like
the
chickadee
and
nuthatch
he
loves
trees
so
well
that
he
tries
to
creep
as
close
to
their
hearts
as
he
possibly
can
would
you
call
this
creeper
mostly
a
winter
bird
asked
dodo
going
to
remember
the
winter
birds
by
themselves
and
write
them
in
my
book
because
there
will
be
fewer
of
them
yes
said
the
doctor
at
least
a
winter
bird
in
places
where
we
mostly
see
him
but
you
know
that
every
bird
must
be
a
summer
bird
somewhere
the
brown
creeper
length
five
and
a
half
inches
upper
parts
mixed
brown
white
and
buff
a
plain
brown
tail
and
a
band
on
the
wings
under
parts
white
without
any
marks
bill
very
sharp
and
slender
curved
like

surgeon

chapter
xi
mockers
and
scolders
the
sage
thrasher
i
thought
that
more
birds
such
as
woodpeckers
would
come
next
said
rap
we
are
still
taking
the
birds
that
sing
said
the
doctor
woodpeckers
have
no
real
song
they
belong
to
the
birds
that
croak
and
call
but
the
nuthatch
chickadee
and
brown
creeper
each
has
a
little
tune
of
its
own
as
you
have
heard
of
course
i
do
see
why
i
said
that
for
i
know
woodpeckers
only
hammer
and
croak
said
rap
the
family
of
mockers
thrashers
and
wrens
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
that
we
shall
meet
in
our
birdland
excursions
for
all
its
members
are
bright
intelligent
birds
and
great
talkers
they
have
something
to
say
for
themselves
and
say
it
so
cleverly
that
we
do
not
care
if
their
feathers
are
of
sober
grays
and
browns
this
family
should
be
very
proud
of
itself
but
it
does
not
show
any
false
pride
or
exclusiveness
its
different
members
are
as
sociable
and
friendly
as
possible
building
their
nests
in
bushes
not
far
from
the
ground
and
taking
every
occasion
to
chat
confidentially
with
house
people
some
of
these
friendly
birds
are
the
sage
thrasher
the
mockingbird
the
catbird
the
brown
thrasher
the
rock
wren
the
house
wren
and
the
marsh
wren
the
last
being
the
only
really
shy
bird
among
the
seven
i
am
going
to
tell
you
about
illustration
sage
thrasher
do
wrens
and
mockingbirds
belong
to
the
same
family
asked
nat
one
so
little
and
one
so
big
mother
had
a
mockingbird
in
a
cage
once
but
it
got
out
and
flew
away
to
live
in
the
park
she
thought
they
are
cousins
and
belong
to
the
same
large
family
though
to
different
households
like
house
people
the
sage
thrasher
belongs
only
to
the
west
just
as
its
relative
the
brown
thrasher
belongs
to
the
eastern
part
of
the
country
when
your
cousin
olive
and
i
lived
one
summer
here
and
there
from
colorado
westward
it
was
this
bird
that
made
us
feel
at
home
by
its
sweet
sociable
music
everywhere
in
that
mountainous
region
the
sagebrush
with
its
blue
flower
spikes
spreads
over
the
ground
making
a
silvery
greenness
where
other
plants
could
not
grow
in
and
out
of
the
sage
nests
and
scratches
and
hops
this
thrasher
taking
its
name
from
the
plant
he
also
ventures
up
on
the
mountain
sides
giving
his
inquisitive
questioning
mocking
notes
and
so
earns
a
second
name
in
those
places
where
he
is
called
the
mountain
mockingbird
though
he
is
a
good
deal
smaller
than
the
true
mockingbird
of
the
south
they
have
many
points
in
common
they
can
both
imitate
almost
any
sound
that
strikes
their
fancy
such
as
the
songs
of
other
birds
whistle
various
tunes
of
their
own
and
almost
mock
the
peculiarities
of
human
speech
not
that
they
all
do
it
oh
no
many
have
only
their
own
beautiful
natural
song
every
mockingbird
has
not
the
power
of
imitation
but
certain
members
of
the
tribe
acquire
a
knack
of
mockery
of
which
they
seem
quite
conscious
the
sage
thrasher
though
gentle
and
sociable
in
its
wild
state
does
not
thrive
in
cages
as
well
as
the
true
mocker
it
seems
to
miss
the
broad
expanse
of
plain
and
mountain
to
which
it
has
been
used
and
seldom
lives
long
in
confinement
read
what
you
have
written
about
the
size
and
color
of
this
thrasher

the
doctor

rap

the
mockingbird
mammy
bun
knows
about
mockingbirds
said
dodo
she
says
the
bushes
were
full
of
them
down
in
louisiana
where
she
was
born
and
that
sometimes
they
used
to
sit
on
the
top
of
the
cabins
and
sing
so
loud
at
night
when
the
moon
shone
that
the
children
could
go
to
sleep
and
they
had
to
throw
sticks
and
things
at
them
did
the
children
throw
sticks
at
the
birds
or
the
birds
pelt
the
children
laughed
the
doctor
for
poor
dodo
was
famous
for
mixing
up
her
sentences
no
no
uncle
roy
neither
the
children
threw
the
sticks
at
the
mockers
what
else
did
mammy
bun
tell
you
lots
and
lots
of
things
and
a
song
too
that
her
people
used
to
sing
about
the
mockers
only
i
ca
tell
it
as
she
does
because
you
know
she
has
a
sort
of
language
all
her
own
suppose
we
ask
mammy
to
come
and
tell
us
about
the
mockingbirds
herself
said
olive
may
we
father
certainly
if
you
can
coax
her
the
children
followed
olive
to
the
house
and
soon
returned
leading
mammy
who
was
chuckling
and
out
of
breath
but
evidently
very
much
pleased
to
be
asked
she
could
not
be
persuaded
to
try
the
perch
so
they
made
her
a
sort
of
throne
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
and
sat
respectfully
in
a
row
in
front
of
her
mammy
wore
a
print
dress
with
white
figures
on
it
but
as
she
was
one
of
the
good
old
sort
she
had
a
plaid
handkerchief
tied
turban
fashion
round
her
head
as
she
talked
she
rolled
her
eyes
and
waved
her
hands
a
good
deal
and
her
words
had
a
soft
comfortable
sound
like
molasses
pouring
out
of

while

while

suddenly
mammy
jumped
up
and
waving
the
children
off
started
for
the
house
as
fast
as
she
could
trot
muttering
to
herself
what
the
matter
called
olive
has
a
bee
stung
you

but
dem

foh
yoh
lunch
like
not
dey
rised
till
bust
an
popped
over
and
mammy
disappeared
amid
a
chorus
of
laughter
what
mammy
has
said
about
the
mockingbird
in
his
summer
home
is
true
as
a
visitor
who
sometimes
stays
and
builds
he
strays
east
and
north
as
far
as
massachusetts
and
westward
to
colorado
and
california
if
he
were
not
a
hardy
bird
who
sometimes
raises
three
broods
a
year
afraid
the
race
would
come
to
an
end
because
so
many
nestlings
are
taken
each
year
and
sold
for
cage
birds
the
mockingbird
length
about
ten
inches
upper
parts
gray
but
on
the
wings
which
have
a
large
white
spot
three
white
feathers
on
each
side
of
the
tail
which
is
blackish
the
males
who
sing
have
more
white
on
the
wings
and
tail
than
the
females
who
are
songless
under
parts
whitish
sings
his
own
true
song
a
rapid
sweet
melody
heard
best
after
twilight
but
has
many
comic
songs
of
whatever
nonsense
comes
into
his
head
a
citizen
of
the
southern
united
states
often
straying
northward
to
new
england
a
ground
gleaner
tree
trapper
and
seed
sower
the
catbird
when
the
doctor
said
catbird
the
children
began
to
imitate
the
various
calls
this
famous
garden
bird
utters
for
by
this
time
they
were
familiar
with
all
his
tricks
and
manners
some
of
the
imitations
were
very
good
indeed
if
not
musical
miou
zeay
zeay
that
is
all
very
well
in
its
way
said
the
doctor
but
which
one
of
you
can
imitate
his
song
i
often
tried
said
rap
but
somehow
he
always
gets
ahead
of
me
and
i
lose
the
place
listen
there
is
one
singing
now
in
the
grape
arbor
and
he
has
a
nest
somewhere
in
the
syringa
bushes
said
olive
the
catbird
was
not
alarmed
when
he
saw
that
five
pairs
of
eyes
were
turned
upon
him
he
seemed
to
know
that
the
secret
of
his
nest
was
in
safe
keeping
flew
out
to
the
pointed
top
of
a
and
continued
his
song
jerking
his
tail
up
and
down
and
showing
the
rusty
feathers
beneath
as
if
this
motion
had
something
to
do
with
the
force
of
his
music
i
can
hear
the
words
as
plain
as
anything
said
nat
if
i
only
understood
his
language
that
is
the
difficulty
said
the
doctor
if
some
kind
bird
would
write
a
dictionary
for
us
we
should
soon
learn
a
great
many
strange
things
roger
the
gardener
says
that
catbirds
are
bad
things
and
if
he
had
his
way
he
would
shoot
them
he
says
they
bite
the
strawberries
and
grapes
and
things
even
when
he
is
looking
at
them
said
dodo
there
is
some
truth
in
what
roger
says
replied
the
doctor
but
on
the
other
hand
the
catbird
besides
being
a
merry
garden
neighbor
and
musician
which
in
itself
is
enough
to
pay
his
rent
belongs
as
a
citizen
to
the
tree
trappers
and
ground
gleaners
and
is
also
a
great
sower
of
wild
fruits
though
he
does
provoke
us
at
times
by
taking
a
bite
from
the
largest
berries
in
the
bed
yet
he
really
prefers
wild
fruits
if
he
can
find
them
so
it
is
better
for
us
to
protect
our
grape
arbors
and
strawberry
beds
with
nets
and
bits
of
bright
tin
strung
on
twine
to
frighten
him
away
from
them
than
to
lose
him
as
a
friend
and
insect
destroyer
surely
his
song
is
worth
a
few
handfuls
of
cherries
then
he
is
such
a
sympathetic
bird
always
willing
to
help
his
neighbors
when
they
have
trouble
with
crows
or
squirrels
and
when
half
a
dozen
pairs
of
catbirds
choose
the
garden
for
their
home
you
may
be
sure
that
they
will
furnish
fun
as
well
as
music
why
does
he
jerk
his
tail
so
asked
dodo
it
is
a
trick
that
all
the
family
have
said
the
doctor
from
which
some
of
them
are
supposed
to
have
taken
the
name
of
thrasher
but
that
is
doubtful
the
mockingbird
thrashes
about
in
his
cage
the
brown
thrasher
on
the
ground
under
the
bushes
the
house
wren
does
the
same
and
the
tiny
winter
wren
gives
his
tail
a
jerk
instead
for
it
is
not
long
enough
to
really
thrash
there
is
a
bird
beating
with
his
tail
down
under
the
quince
bushes
now
said
dodo
is
that
some
kind
of
a
cousin
it
a
song
thrush
said
rap
or
rather
what
the
wise
men
call
a
brown
thrasher
said
the
doctor
the
very
bird
of
which
i
was
speaking
illustration
catbird
who
are
the
wise
men
asked
rap
a
society
of
house
people
who
study
american
birds
and
decide
by
what
name
it
is
best
to
call
each
species
so
that
each
may
be
known
everywhere
by
the
same
name
this
brown
thrasher
is
sometimes
called
song
thrush
brown
thrush
brown
mockingbird
and
mavis
though
the
first
and
the
last
of
these
four
names
belong
only
to
a
kind
of
european
thrush
that
is
never
found
in
this
country
you
see
how
confusing
this
is
and
how
much
better
it
is
for
the
wise
men
who
know
him
intimately
to
give
him
one
name
you
can
be
sure
is
right
the
catbird
length
between
eight
and
nine
inches
upper
parts
slate
color
crown
bill
feet
and
tail
black
under
parts
lighter
color
except
a
patch
under
the
tail
a
summer
citizen
of
the
united
states
a
ground
gleaner
tree
trapper
and
seed
sower
the
brown
thrasher
as
i
told
you
a
moment
ago
this
handsome
bird
with
keen
eyes
curved
bill
and
long
graceful
tail
that
opens
and
shuts
like
a
fan
has
several
names
besides
that
of
brown
thrasher
which
seems
the
most
suitable
for
him
he
looks
redder
than
brown
for
we
called
the
wood
thrush
said
nat
yes
his
back
is
a
much
brighter
brown
than
that
of
any
thrush
and
this
will
show
you
the
need
in
studying
birds
of
being
able
to
distinguish
between
several
shades
of
the
same
color
there
are
words
to
represent
these
different
grades
of
color
such
as
for
and
for
these
you
must
learn
later
on
for
some
of
them
are
pretty
hard
ones
now
it
is
better
for
you
to
use
words
whose
meaning
is
perfectly
familiar
to
you
the
brown
of
this
thrasher
you
see
is
brighter
than
that
of
the
wood
thrush
it
is
a
ruddy
brown
with
a
faint
brassy
glint
something
like
a
polished
doorknob
particularly
when
the
sun
strikes
his
back
how
he
scratches
round
upon
the
ground
said
dodo
just
like
a
hen
why
does
he
belong
to
the
birds
that
scratch
because
for
one
reason
his
feet
have
the
three
toes
in
front
and
the
one
behind
all
on
the
same
level
this
makes
him
a
perching
bird
do
all
birds
sit
on
a
perch
when
they
go
to
sleep
asked
dodo
by
no
means
the
perching
birds
grasp
a
twig
firmly
with
their
very
limber
toes
and
sharp
claws
and
put
their
head
under
their
wing
but
many
others
like
tame
geese
and
ducks
sleep
standing
on
the
ground
on
one
foot
or
sometimes
floating
on
the
water
the
thrasher
is
a
ground
gleaner
who
spends
most
of
his
time
in
the
underbrush
having
a
great
appetite
for
the
wicked
may
beetle
but
he
does
not
live
near
the
ground
only
mounting
high
in
a
tree
when
he
wishes
to
sing
as
if
he
needed
the
pure
high
air
in
order
to
breathe
well
and
he
never
sings
from
the
heart
of
a
thick
bush
as
the
catbird
does
so
frequently
but
i
am
wrong
in
saying
that
he
goes
up
into
trees
to
sing
for
there
is
no
denying
that
he
visits
cherry
trees
to
pick
cherries
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
is
neither
invited
nor
welcome
yet
we
must
remember
that
if
he
does
like
fruit
for
dessert
he
has
also
first
eaten
and
and
so
has
certainly
earned
some
cherries
hush
whispered
olive
our
thrasher
is
singing
now
in
the
birch
tree
where
you
can
both
see
and
hear
him
that
a
sure
sign
his
nest
is
not
very
near
said
rap
for
they
never
sing
close
by
their
nests
this
thrasher
was
clinging
to
the
end
of
a
slender
branch
one
claw
above
the
other
so
that
his
head
which
was
thrown
back
looked
straight
up
to
the
sky
he
seemed
to
be
half
talking
and
half
singing
as
if
giving
directions
to
some
unseen
performer
then
following
these
by
two
or
three
clear
notes
what
is
he
saying
said
dodo
he
is
telling
you
who
he
is
and
what
he
sees
from
the
said
the
doctor
olive
dear
i
am
going
to
repeat
to
the
children
the
jingle
you
made
about
the
thrasher
though
olive
then
blushed
and
said
it
was
only
nonsense
the
children
were
delighted
with
it
my
creamy
breast
is
speckled
perhaps
you
call
it
freckled
black
and
brown
my
pliant
russet
tail
beats
like
a
frantic
flail
up
and
down
in
the
top
branch
of
a
tree
you
may
chance
to
glance
at
me
when
i
sing
but
i
very
shy
when
i
silently
float
by
on
the
wing
there
there
such
a
clatter
what
the
matter
what
the

that

illustration
the

thrasher
the
brown
thrasher
length
eleven
inches
above
bright
with
two
light
bands
on
each
wing
beneath
spotted
with
very
dark
brown
on
the
breast
and
the
sides
very
long
tail
about
five
inches
a
summer
citizen
of
the
united
states
east
of
the
rocky
mountains
a
famous
ground
gleaner
and
seed
sower
the
rock
wren
when
the
children
had
finished
applauding
olive
poetry
or
was
it
really
the
thrasher
own
performance
the
doctor
went
on
we
have
seen
that
the
west
has
one
sort
of
a
thrasher
in
the
and
the
east
another
in
our
own
gardens
i
also
told
you
that
these
birds
were
a
kind
of
overgrown
wren
and
before
we
call
upon
jenny
wren
i
want
to
tell
you
about
a
bigger
relative
of
hers
that
olive
and
i
knew
when
we
were
in
the
rocky
mountains
he
is
called
the
rock
wren
oh
i
know
because
he
lives
in
the
rocky
mountains
said
dodo
clapping
her
hands
at
this
discovery
yes
that
is
partly
the
reason
resumed
the
doctor
after
this
interruption
but
those
mountains
are
very
many
and
varied
in
appearance
like
most
others
covered
in
most
places
with
pine
trees
but
including
in
their
recesses
grassy
meadows
and
silvery
lakes
some
parts
of
those
mountains
are
the
home
of
the
rock
wren
but
the
little
fellow
is
quite
as
well
satisfied
anywhere
else
in
the
western
parts
of
the
united
states
if
he
can
find
heaps
of
stones
to
play
in
with
his
mate
or
great
smooth
boulders
to
skip
up
to
the
top
of
and
sing
so
you
see
the
mountains
and
the
wrens
are
both
named
for
the
rocks
do
these
wrens
look
like
our
kind
and
act
that
way
asked
nat
ours
always
make
me
think
of
mice
all
kinds
of
wrens
are
much
alike
answered
the
doctor
they
are
small
brownish
birds
with
cocked
up
tails
not
at
all
shy
about
showing
themselves
off
when
they
choose
but
they
must
have
some
to
duck
into
the
moment
anything
frightens
them
and
some
odd
nook
or
cranny
for
their
big
rubbishy
nests
some
prefer
to
hide
in
marshes
among
the
thickest
reeds
some
live
in
dry
brush
heaps
and
some
like
the
rock
wren
choose
piles
of
stones
their
wings
are
not
very
strong
and
they
seldom
venture
far
from
their
favorite
retreats
except
when
they
are
migrating
when
your
cousin
olive
and
i
were
in
colorado
we
climbed
a
mountain
one
day
above
the
do
the
trees
out
there
grow
in
straight
lines
asked
dodo
anxiously
illustration
rock
wren
no
my
dear
little
girl
trees
do
grow
in
straight
lines
anywhere
said
the
doctor
laughing
except
when
they
are
planted
so
the
of
a
mountain
is
the
edge
of
the
woods
above
which
no
trees
grow
and
we
see
nothing
but
bare
rocks
and
the
few
low
plants
that
cling
to
the
cracks
among
them
well
we
had
hardly
rested
long
enough
to
get
our
breath
after
such
a
climb
when
we
heard
a
rich
ringing
song
something
like
a
house
wren
but
louder
and
stronger
and
very
quick
as
if
the
bird
were
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
through
but
he
was
for
he
kept
saying
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
presently
we
spied
him
on
the
tiptop
of
a
pile
of
stones
standing
quite
still
with
his
head
thrown
back
and
his
bill
pointing
straight
up
he
looked
gray
dusted
over
with
dots
on
the
back
and
his
bill
was
very
straight
and
sharp
almost
an
inch
long
it
looked
this
was
a
rock
wren
he
must
have
had
a
nest
somewhere
in
those
rocks
said
rap
wrens
most
always
have
nests
near
where
they
sing
no
doubt
he
had
as
it
was
the
nesting
season
june
answered
the
doctor
but
it
was
growing
late
in
the
day
we
had
a
long
scramble
down
the
mountain
before
us
and
could
not
wait
to
hunt
for
it
most
likely
too
if
we
had
found
the
very
place
where
it
was
we
should
not
have
been
able
to
see
it
for
probably
it
was
tucked
away
too
far
in
a
crooked
passage
under
a
shelving
rock
when
we
were
down
the
mountain
we
passed
a
miner
cabin
he
was
at
home
and
we
sat
down
on
a
bench
by
the
door
to
rest
thinking
he
might
know
about
the
nest
of
the
rock
wren
for
an
old
miner
knows
a
great
many
things
he
never
thinks
of
making
a
book
about
i
asked
him
if
there
were
any
wrens
around
there
i
should
smile
stranger
lots
on
one
kind
too
but
mostly
not
the
kind
they
have
where
you
tenderfoots
live
bigger
and
pickeder
in
front
and
make
more
fuss
when
they
fust
come
about
may
or
nigh
onter
june
they
act
kinder
shy
like
but
they
get
uster
to
yer
soon
they
find
nobody
ai
goin
to
bother
with
and
stay
around
altogether
mostly
in
the
rocks
last
there
was
two
on
come
nigh
chinking
up
this
shebang
with
trash
they
hauled
in
for
a
nest
afore
they
got
it
fixed
to
suit
and
had
it
chuck
full
o
speckled
eggs
then
one
of
these
yere
blamed
tore
it
all
up
and
they
had
to
start
in
to
hauling
more
trash
so
you
see
children
this
miner
knew
a
rock
wren
do
you
know
a
jenny
wren
the
rock
wren
length
nearly
six
inches
back
gray
with
fine
dots
under
parts
no
particular
color
some
of
the
with
black
bars
and
tips
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
from
the
rocky
mountains
to
the
pacific
ocean
a
ground
gleaner
the
house
wren
we
all
know
jenny
wren
cried
the
children
the
farm
is
full
of
jennies
and
johnnies
they
build
in
said
dodo
and
in
old
tin
cans
and
water
pots
and
anything
they
find
said
rap
and
jenny
does
most
of
the
work
if
the
can
is
very
large
she
fills
it
full
of
sticks
until
there
is
only
a
cosy
little
corner
left
for
the
nest
for
she
is
a
very
neat
bird
said
the
doctor
when
he
could
be
heard
she
keeps
her
house
nice
and
clean
and
is
very
industrious
too
making
a
fresh
nest
for
every
new
brood
which
means
a
great
deal
of
work
for
wrens
often
raise
three
families
a
season
but
johnny
wren
works
too
does
he
asked
nat
he
is
always
taking
home
bugs
and
things
and
he
sings
as
if
he
would
split
wrens
live
in
woodpiles
in
winter
said
rap
the
doctor
laughed
heartily
at
the
hurry
with
which
the
children
told
their
knowledge
everybody
has
a
bowing
acquaintance
with
the
house
wren
he
said
for
they
are
seen
everywhere
through
the
united
states
those
that
are
citizens
of
the
west
being
a
trifle
paler
in
color
and
more
sharply
barred
than
their
easterly
brothers
but
all
having
the
same
habits
even
the
rock
wren
is
as
jolly
and
sociable
as
his
cousins
but
the
wren
that
rap
says
lives
in
the
woodpile
in
the
winter
is
not
our
house
wren
but
another
member
of
the
same
family
the
smallest
of
all
called
the
winter
wren
he
is
a
citizen
of
the
far
north
whence
he
follows
the
mountains
down
to
carolina
and
he
is
chiefly
seen
when
he
visits
the
eastern
states
in
the
winter
hence
his
name
but
few
who
see
him
then
have
heard
his
one
of
the
sweetest
bits
of
our
bird
music
hear
johnny
wren
singing
on
the
trellis
and
his
wife
scolding
at
him
all
the
time
too
i
wonder
why
she
does
it
said
nat
she
is
only
making
believe
scold
said
the
doctor
because
she
has
a
quick
temper
and
wants
to
say
something
and
can
not
exactly
sing
johnny
and
jenny
make
a
great
fuss
but
they
are
really
very
fond
of
each
other
and
make
the
very
best
of
citizens
eating
no
fruits
and
being
officers
in
the
guilds
of
ground
gleaners
and
tree
trappers
look
said
dodo
jenny
is
scolding
and
dancing
about
and
johnny
is
singing
away
again
what
is
the
matter

them
uncle
roy

did
you

the

you
must
always
wear
your

when
you
go
to
look
for
the

said
the
doctor
and
you
must
be
careful
where
you
step
for
this
wren
knows
where
to
put
his
nest
safely
out
of
the
way
of
both
house
people
and
cats
he
chooses
a
bunch
of
reeds
or
a
bush
that
is
surrounded
either
by
water
or
the
treacherous
green
grass
of
bogs
and
there
weaves
an
oblong

nest
from
coarse
grass
and
leaves
with
a
little
hole
on
one
side
for
a
door
this
done
he
goes
to

distance
and
appoints
himself

to

if

touches
the
grass
ever
so
lightly
he
tells
his

it

they
flit
off
and
if
any
one
thinks
that
by
following
the
birds
they
will
find
the
nest
they
will
be
very
much
disappointed
and
will
lead
them
a

when
the

are

the

woodland
warblers
now
you
may
be
introduced
to
a
family
of
american
birds
many
of
them
brightly
colored
and
none
of
them
large
who
have
no
cousins
or
relations
in
any
other
country
you
must
not
expect
them
to
come
and
peep
in
the
window
like
the
catbird
or
feed
on
the
lawn
like
the
thrush
and
robin
for
they
are
birds
of
woodland
and
brushland
yet
the
often
come
for
a
time
in
their
journeys
to
gardens
and
orchards
for
they
are
among
the
greatest
travellers
why
do
they
travel
so
much
if
they
are
only
american
birds
asked
nat
i
should
think
they
would
have
to
go
far
if
they
always
live
in
america
america
is
a
very
large
country
my
boy
and
you
must
not
forget
it
includes
south
as
well
as
north
america
the
western
hemisphere
of
the
whole
globe
warblers
are
citizens
and
can
not
live
long
on
anything
else
now
as
many
of
them
nest
far
north
when
the
early
frosts
lock
the
country
they
must
often
make
long
journeys
at
short
notice
until
they
find
their
insect
food
again
why
do
we
see
swarms
and
swarms
of
them
flying
by
asked
dodo
you
mean
flocks
said
olive
we
only
say
when
we
mean
bees
or
other
insects
they
make
their
journeys
mostly
by
night
continued
the
doctor
for
darkness
protects
their
bright
colors
from
the
cannibal
birds
and
various
other
enemies
one
day
there
will
not
be
a
single
warbler
in
the
river
woods
and
the
next
the
trees
will
be
bright
with
them
another
reason
that
we
do
not
commonly
see
these
warblers
is
that
the
greatest
number
do
not
come
from
the
south
until
the
trees
are
in
leaf
and
they
pass
back
again
through
the
middle
portions
of
the
states
before
the
trees
are
bare
in
autumn
so
that
they
easily
hide
from
us
are
there
no
birds
that
live
all
winter
where
the
trees
are
bare
asked
rap
yes
three
the
cardinal
the
crossbill
and
the
pine
grosbeak
they
are
birds
and
all
belong
to
the
sparrow
family
most
of
the
very
showy
birds
belong
to
tropical
countries
where
the
trees
are
always
in
leaf
and
there
are
quantities
of
orchids
and
other
conspicuous
flowers
to
attract
the
eye
from
the
birds
themselves
this
habit
of
travelling
by
night
has
caused
a
great
many
of
these
beautiful
warblers
to
lose
their
lives
for
they
often
fly
against
telegraph
wires
high
steeples
and
lighthouse
towers
and
are
killed
another
danger
also
besets
them
they
may
come
from
the
south
with
a
bit
of
early
mild
weather
and
nearing
the
great
lakes
meet
a
storm
from
the
north
and
the
being
very
scanty
the
icy
winds
overcome
their
strength
a
friend
of
mine
who
lives
in
wisconsin
continued
the
doctor
has
a
garden
that
slopes
down
to
geneva
lake
late
one
april
there
came
a
windstorm
from
the
northwest
and
the
next
morning
the
lawn
was
strewn
with
the
bodies
of
hundreds
of
little
warblers
who
had
become
confused
in
the
darkness
and
unable
to
reach
shelter
you
see
how
many
troubles
and
risks
citizen
bird
has
to
endure
at
best
so
that
we
house
people
should
do
everything
we
can
to
protect
him
and
make
his
life
among
us
happy
you
will
have
more
use
for
your
eyes
than
your
ears
in
naming
the
warblers
their
plumage
is
almost
always
striking
but
their
voices
are
rather
lisping
than
musical
though
they
sing
pretty
little
snatches
in
the
woods
but
many
of
their
sound
more
like
the
squeaks
and
buzzings
of
insects
and
than
like
the
voices
of
birds
and
it
will
take
time
and
practice
before
you
can
distinguish
them
apart
i
have
chosen
only
half
a
dozen
species
to
tell
you
of
from
the
that
rove
about
the
united
states
the
first
and
one
that
you
are
the
most
likely
to
see
is
the
warbler
the
warbler
there
are
exceptions
to
everything
said
the
doctor
as
he
pointed
to
an
old
willow
tree
on
the
edge
of
the
river
woods
where
he
had
taken
the
children
to
look
for
warblers
and
the
exception
among
the
shy
warblers
of
these
woods
is
that
sociable
little
fellow
over
there
who
is
creeping
and
swinging
about
the
branches
as
if
he
was
own
brother
to
the
brown
creeper
himself
this
warbler
hides
his
nest
in
an
overturned
stump
or
on
the
ground
and
you
may
try
for
days
in
vain
to
find
one
but
at
the
same
time
he
spends
his
time
running
merrily
through
the
orchard
trees
even
whispering
his
husky
tweet
to
the
old
queen
apple
by
the
study
window
is
that
bird
a
warbler
asked
nat
i
thought
he
was
some
kind
of
a
nuthatch
or
a
woodpecker
he
was
with
a
whole
lot
of
them
up
by
the
house
last
week
i
used
to
think
so
too
said
rap
but
now
i
see
a
difference
the
body
and
bill
of
the
nuthatch
is
stouter
and
not
such
a
pretty
shape
and
his
bill
almost
turns
up
this
warbler
is
thinner
with
a
slender
bill
that
curves
a
little
down
like
the
brown
creeper
then
too
he
has
smaller
and
finer
stripes
than
any
woodpecker
illustration
warbler
what
guild
does
he
belong
to
asked
dodo
to
the
tree
trappers
most
of
the
warblers
belong
to
this
while
some
have
joined
the
sky
sweepers
and
a
few
the
ground
gleaners
and
seed
sowers
look
said
nat
he
has
spent
a
long
time
on
one
twig
and
he
seem
to
have
cleaned
off
all
the
insects
yet
he
must
have
pretty
good
eyes
yes
and
more
than
that
said
the
doctor
his
eyes
magnify
much
more
than
ours
do
so
that
all
objects
appear
far
larger
to
a
bird
than
they
do
to
us
and
they
can
see
insects
that
we
never
notice
i
wonder
if
that
little
warbler
thinks
spiders
are
crabs
and
flies
chickens
said
dodo
so
soberly
that
all
the
others
laughed
heartily
the
warbler
length
five
inches
upper
parts
striped
everywhere
with
black
and
white
under
parts
white
in
the
middle
with
many
black
stripes
on
the
sides
has
a
weak
and
wheezy
voice
from
its
habit
of
scrambling
about
and
branches
it
may
be
mistaken
for
a
real
creeper
or
a
nuthatch
or
even
a
little
woodpecker
a
summer
citizen
of
the
united
states
east
of
the
plains
in
winter
from
florida
southward
a
tree
trapper
the
yellow
warbler
or
summer
yellowbird
i
know
this
warbler
by
sight
already
said
dodo
there
is
one
in
the
low
case
in
the
wonder
room
the
pretty
bird
sitting
on
a
fuzzy
nest
it
looks
like
a
canary
you
may
think
that
he
looks
like
a
canary
at
a
little
distance
but
not
when
you
are
near
by
said
the
doctor
the
canary
has
a
short
thick
bill
suited
to
cracking
seeds
while
the
yellow
warbler
has
the
slender
bill
necessary
for
prying
into
small
cracks
and
crannies
for
insects
this
warbler
also
has
light
rusty
streaks
on
his
yellow
breast
do
you
remember
having
ever
seen
a
canary
with
such
markings
nat
and
dodo
thought
for
a
moment
and
then
said
they
never
had
it
really
may
not
be
like
a
canary
said
rap
and
it
has
much
of
a
song
but
it
has
so
many
cute
little
ways
that
it
seems
like
one
i
know
a
boy
who
always
says
it
a
wild
canary
but
it
ca
be
that
i
see
a
pair
of
these
warblers
have
a
nest
in
one
of
the
elder
bushes
by
our
fence
and
they
would
mind
a
bit
if
we
went
to
look
at
them
would
it
be
too
far
for
you
to
come
sir
he
inquired
timidly
of
the
doctor
evidently
proud
of
having
something
to
show
illustration
yellow
warbler
we
shall
be
glad
to
see
the
nest
my
boy
how
is
it
that
you
have
so
many
birds
about
your
house
i
think
it
partly
for
the
same
reason
that
you
have
birds
here
for
we
do
keep
cats
either
and
it
partly
because
we
have
four
big
old
mulberry
trees
what
have
mulberry
trees
to
do
with
birds
asked
nat
without
stopping
to
think
everything
said
the
doctor
the
mulberry
is
one
of
the
most
attractive
fruits
to
our
familiar
birds
and
at
least
species
feed
upon
it
greedily
whoever
plants
a
mulberry
tree
in
his
garden
sends
a
public
invitation
through
birdland
for
its
people
to
come
and
live
with
him
the
invitation
is
always
accepted
and
the
birds
appreciate
the
kindness
so
much
that
when
they
find
mulberries
they
leave
the
cherries
and
strawberries
in
that
garden
in
peace
this
should
teach
us
to
plant
wild
fruits
and
berries
for
the
birds
who
prefer
them
to
garden
fruits
as
the
children
turned
from
the
road
into
rap
garden
they
saw
that
it
held
a
great
many
birds
the
bushes
and
trees
were
all
untrimmed
and
the
old
house
with
its
shingled
sides
and
roof
was
covered
with
a
and
some
grape
vines
what
a
lovely
place
for
hummingbirds
cried
olive
and
martins
added
the
doctor
pointing
to
a
with
ten
or
twelve
divisions
in
it
that
was
fastened
under
the
eaves
the
warbler
nest
is
here
said
rap
leading
the
way
to
a
back
fence
and
feeling
very
proud
at
the
admiration
his
home
was
receiving
the
children
tiptoed
up
and
each
took
a
peep
into
the
nest
the
little
gold
and
olive
mother
trusting
rap
from
past
experience
gave
a
quick
flip
of
her
wings
and
perched
on
a
wild
blackberry
bush
near
by
the
outside
of
the
nest
looked
as
if
it
were
made
of
linen
floss
there
were
some
horsehairs
woven
in
the
lining
and
here
and
there
something
that
looked
like
sponge
peeped
out
between
the
strands
which
held
the
nest
firmly
in
the
crotch
of
the
elder
stem
what
is
that
soft
stuff
whispered
dodo
it
is
wool
scraped
from
the
stalks
of
young
ferns
said
the
doctor
the
soft
brown
wool
that
is
wrapped
round
the
leaves
to
keep
them
warm
in
their
winter
sleep
until
they
stretch
out
of
the
ground
and
feel
the
warmth
of
the
sun
the
little
warblers
gather
it
in
their
beaks
and
mat
it
into
a
sort
of
felt
there
is
something
else
in
the
that
looks
like
feathers
said
nat
that
is
dandelion
down
do
you
think
doctor
that
this
nest
is
very
thick
underneath
asked
rap
it
is
twice
as
high
as
the
one
they
built
here
last
summer
the
doctor
felt
of
the
bottom
of
the
nest
very
gently
with
one
finger
and
said
i
thought
so
you
have
sharp
eyes
rap
it
is
very
thick
and
for
a
good
reason
it
is
a
nest
a
nest
are
there
such
things
clamored
the
children
together
the
is
worrying
come
over
under
the
mulberry
tree
and
i
will
tell
you
about
this
wonderful
nest
there
are
some
very
shiftless
citizens
in
birdland
called
cowbirds
began
the
doctor
you
will
learn
about
them
when
we
come
to
the
family
to
which
they
belong
they
build
no
nests
but
have
the
habit
of
laying
their
eggs
in
the
nests
of
other
birds
just
as
the
equally
cuckoos
do
in
europe
some
birds
do
not
seem
to
know
the
difference
between
these
strange
eggs
and
their
own
and
so
let
them
remain
until
they
are
hatched
others
are
wise
enough
to
know
their
own
eggs
and
chief
among
such
ones
is
this
little
yellow
warbler
coming
home
some
morning
after
taking
exercise
for
the
good
of
her
health
warbler
finds
a
great
white
egg
spotted
with
brown
crowded
in
among
her
own
small
pale
blue
eggs
that
have
their
brown
spots
mostly
arranged
like
a
wreath
around
the
larger
end
being
disgusted
and
very
angry
to
find
her
house
invaded
she
and
her
mate
have
a
talk
about
the
matter
why
they
do
not
simply
push
the
strange
egg
out
we
do
not
know
but
instead
of
that
they
often
fly
off
for
milkweed
fibres
and
silk
to
make
a
new
nest
right
on
top
of
the
first
one
shutting
the
hateful
egg
out
of
sight
underneath
then
they
begin
housekeeping
anew
in
a
nest
like
this
one
living
in
the
upper
story
and
keeping
the
cowbird
egg
locked
up
in
the
basement
where
no
warmth
from
their
bodies
can
reach
it
and
so
it
never
hatches
if
a
second
cowbird
egg
is
laid
in
the
new
upper
story
of
the
nest
the
warblers
generally
abandon
their
home
in
despair
and
choose
a
new
nesting
place
but
sometimes
they
build
a
third
story
over
the
other
two
and
thus
defeat
the
evil
designs
of
both
their
enemies
without
giving
up
their
home
this
nest
of
rap
is
a
one
and
when
i
touched
the
bottom
i
could
feel
that
there
was
an
egg
in
the
lower
story
by
and
by
when
the
birds
have
flown
we
will
take
the
nest
apart
and
you
can
see
for
yourselves
how
ingeniously
it
is
made
to
think
of
all
the
ways
birds
have
said
rap
going
to
such
a
heap
of
trouble
for
something
they
could
fix
with
one
good
push
what
happens
when
the
cowbird
egg
stays
in
the
nest
and
hatches
out
are
the
other
little
birds
squeezed
and
uncomfortable
asked
dodo
yes
they
are
very
uncomfortable
indeed
and
often
starve
to
death
but
you
must
wait
to
hear
about
that
until
we
come
to
the
cowbird
himself
what
family
does
he
train
with
asked
nat
with
the
blackbirds
and
orioles
said
the
doctor
then
the
male
yellow
warbler
flew
out
along
a
branch
above
their
heads
gave
his
lisping
song
that
sounded
like
sweet
sweet
sweet
sweeter
seized
an
insect
and
went
across
the
garden
toward
his
nest
i
going
to
watch
that
nest
said
rap
and
if
a
cowbird
lays
in
it
any
more
i
take
the
wicked
old
egg
away
sweet
sweet
sweet
called
the
warbler
from
the
bushes
maybe
he
understood
you
said
dodo
i
believe
most
anything
about
birds
the
yellow
warbler
or
summer
yellowbird
length
about
five
inches
upper
parts
rich
brightest
on
the
rump
and
crown
but
dark
brown
on
wings
and
tail
with
the
inside
half
of
each
yellow
and
some
yellow
edgings
on
the
under
parts
bright
yellow
in
the
male
streaked
with
rich
a
summer
citizen
of
the
greater
part
of
north
america
nesting
in
orchards
and
bushes
and
going
to
the
tropics
in
winter
belongs
to
the
guilds
of
tree
trappers
and
sky
sweepers
the
warbler
or
myrtlebird
this
warbler
does
not
sing
much
of
a
song
even
in
but
you
will
know
him
on
the
wing
by
the
bright
yellow
spot
on
the
rump
and
if
he
perches
near
by
perhaps
you
will
also
see
the
crown
of
gold
on
the
head
and
a
spot
of
yellow
on
each
side
of
the
breast
they
say
there
was
once
a
great
king
named
midas
whose
touch
turned
everything
to
gold
he
was
such
an
avaricious
old
miser
if
that
be
true
he
must
have
put
his
finger
on
the
myrtlebird
in
four
different
places
unlike
most
of
his
family
the
is
fond
of
seeds
and
berries
and
so
he
is
able
to
live
further
north
in
winter
than
any
of
his
brothers
unless
you
are
spending
the
summer
near
the
canadian
border
you
will
not
see
him
in
his
own
home
but
when
they
are
on
their
journeys
in
spring
and
autumn
you
will
meet
them
almost
everywhere
travelling
in
sociable
flocks
illustration
warbler
it
must
be
that
bird
with
a
yellow
spot
on
his
tail
that
gobbles
all
the
bayberries
and
eats
the
berries
too
said
rap
yes
i
see
that
you
know
him
bird
with
a
yellow
spot
on
his
tail
is
not
a
bad
description
of
the
myrtle
warbler
said
the
doctor
at
least
as
you
generally
see
it
in
autumn
or
winter
when
that
particular
spot
is
the
only
one
of
the
four
which
shows
off
well
but
why
is
he
called
warbler
asked
nat
does
he
build
his
nest
in
myrtle
i
thought
myrtle
was
that
plant
down
on
the
ground
that
does
have
berries
no
my
boy
the
bird
is
not
named
from
that
sort
of
creeping
flowering
myrtle
his
name
comes
from
a
latin
word
for
because
the
bird
feeds
upon
its
fruit
as
rap
told
you
and
bayberry
is
that
low
shrub
that
we
gather
in
the
rocky
pasture
to
fill
the
great
jar
in
the
fireplace
said
olive
some
call
it
and
others
yes
said
rap
and
these
warblers
stay
round
that
pasture
in
winter
as
long
as
there
is
a
berry
left

warbler
or
myrtlebird

about
five

a

the
ovenbird
illustration
the
ovenbird
i
will
show
you
a
of
the
ovenbird
because
it
may
be
some
time
before
you
will
see
this
ground
warbler
at
home
in
the
deep
woods
what
is
that
asked
rap
as
the
doctor
took
from
his
pocket
what
looked
merely
like
a
dead
bird
a
so
called
is
the
bird
preserved
and
prepared
for
stuffing
with
all
its
feathers
on
but
without
glass
eyes
and
not
mounted
in
a
natural
position
you
see
that
it
takes
up
much
less
room
than
the
birds
that
are
set
up
in
my
cases
and
is
more
easily
carried
about
he
looks
like
a
little
thrush
said
olive
except
that
he
is
too
green
on
the
back
and
the
stripe
on
his
head
is
of
a
dingy
gold
color
that
is
why
he
is
often
called
the
thrush
though
he
is
not
a
thrush
at
all
but
one
of
the
american
warblers
and
the
crown
is
more
the
color
of
copper
than
like
the
gold
on
the
kinglet
head
perhaps
the
kinglet
is
called
after
new
clean
gold
and
this
after
old
dusty
gold
all
this
time
rap
had
been
looking
intently
at
the
warbler
without
saying
a
word
then
he
said
suddenly
why
it
the
bird
that
builds
the
little
on
the
ground
in
the
river
woods
the
nest
that
is
roofed
all
over
and
has
a
round
hole
in
one
side
for
a
door
i
so
glad
i
know
his
name
for
it
is
in
my
part
of
the
nuttall
book
and
the
miller
does
know
what
he
is
called
is
he
named
ovenbird
because
he
has
a
door
in
one
side
of
his
nest
like
an
oven
yes
rap
the
nest
is
shaped
like
the
kind
of
oven
that
indians
used
tell
us
about
the
one
you
found
i
was
sitting
on
the
bank
where
it
goes
down
a
little
to
the
river
and
the
ground
there
was
humpy
with
bunches
of
grass
a
little
bird
like
this
warbler
ran
from
between
two
of
the
grass
humps
and
picked
about
on
the
ground
for
a
minute
and
then
ran
back
i
thought
he
had
gone
into
a
hole
but
pretty
soon
he
came
out
again
and
flew
up
through
the
bushes
to
a
tall
tree
a
little
way
off
he
went
out
to
the
end
of
a
long
branch
and
began
to
call
soft
at
first
and
then
very
loud
as
if
his
throat
would
split
before
he
ended
it
was
a
very
big
noise
for
such
a
little
bird
did
he
seem
to
say
teacher
teacher
asked
the
doctor
who
knew
john
burroughs
very
well
yes
he
kept
calling
exactly
that
way
then
when
he
stopped
i
looked
for
the
hole
in
the
ground
where
he
came
from
i
felt
round
a
little
and
then
i
lay
down
on
the
bank
and
looked
up
hill
at
the
place
to
try
if
i
could
find
it
that
way
then
i
saw
a
place
where
the
grass
and
leaves
were
made
into
a
sort
of
roof
between
the
grass
humps
and
in
the
middle
of
this
was
a
smooth
round
hole
i
put
my
finger
in
and
another
bird
just
like
the
first
flew
out
and
i
saw
that
there
were
eggs
there
so
i
drove
a
stick
in
the
ground
to
mark
the
place
and
went
away
the
miller
said
it
must
be
a
nest
that
some
birds
had
stolen
but
in
the
fall
i
took
the
nest
home
and
i
saw
it
was
a
real
bird
nest
all
woven
round
of
strong
grass
with
finer
kinds
for
a
lining
and
there
were
dead
leaves
on
the
outside
so
that
the
top
looked
like
all
the
rest
of
the
ground
i
had
often
heard
that
loud
singing
before
but
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
a
good
look
at
the
bird
and
his
nest
and
the
miller
wo
believe
now
that
it
a
nest
either
what
trade
does
the
ovenbird
belong
to
asked
dodo
he
ought
to
be
a
baker

he
lives

is

being
crammed
full
of
good
spirits
he
simply
wants
you
to
share
them
and
have
a
race
sometimes
he
will
stop
a
moment
quite
near
and
call
and
then
fly
off
and
challenge
you
to
a
new
chase

sometimes
if
two

call
at

you
will
stray
away
from

are
very
gentle
lovable
little
birds
too

does
he
sometimes
fly
right
up
in
the

to
sing
a

has
a
way
of
flying

watch

down

you
know
the
doctor
told
us
way
back
that
when
the
male
bird
wore
very
bright
feathers
the

was
oftenest
plain

that

should
see
her
so
easily
when
she
sat
on

nest
you
are
right

always
let
the

answer
each
other
questions

they
could

arithmetic
and
poor
nat
looked
quite
discouraged
you
certainly
have
to
remember
the
laws
of
birdland
as
well
as
their
exceptions
answered
the
doctor
but
when
you
have
once
recognized
and
named
a
bird
you
will
carry
its
picture
always
in
your
mind
for
the
redstarts
that
you
will
see
when
you
are
very
old
men
and
women
will
be
like
the
one
that
is
dancing
along
the
walk
now
why
do
they
call
this
warbler
a
asked
dodo
because
it
has
a
lot
of
red
on
it
and
it
always
starting
up
in
a
hurry
ventured
rap
that
is
not
the
real
reason
said
the
doctor
the
name
comes
from
a
german
word
that
means
tail
and
rightly
belongs
to
a
bird
of
europe
that
is
never
found
in
this
country
our
bird
has
some
red
on
the
tail
but
i
really
think
that
rap
answer
is
the
better
one
the
american
redstart
length
about
five
and
a
half

shining
black
marked
on
the

and

with

and

and
on

chapter
xiii
around
the
old
barn
this
day
the
bird
lovers
from
orchard
farm
were
having
a
picnic
in
the
hickory
and
oak
woods
back
of
the
fields
it
was
a
charming
place
for
such
a
day
outing
for
on
the
edge
of
the
woods
stood
an
old
hay
barn
which
was
empty
in
early
june
and
a
capital
place
in
which
to
play
i
spy
and
feet
above
water
on
the
other
side
of
the
wood
was
an
old
swampy
meadow
full
of
saplings
and
tangled
bushes
such
as
birds
love
for
nesting
places
the
doctor
had
set
rap
nat
and
dodo
roaming
about
to
look
for
birds
and
promised
to
tell
them
something
of
their
habits
when
each
child
had
written
down
the
description
of
two
birds
the
children
divided
their
hunting
ground
so
that
they
might
not
interfere
with
each
other
dodo
chose
the
woods
because
she
wanted
to
stay
near
olive
who
was
making
a
sketch
of
some
ferns
rap
took
the
old
barn
and
a
bit
of
bushy
pasture
near
it
and
nat
went
down
to
the
swampy
meadow
with
its
border
of
cedar
trees
while
they
tramped
about
the
doctor
sat
with
his
back
against
the
side
of
the
barn
looking
over
the
beautiful
scene
and
thinking
the
children
did
not
return
until
after
mammy
bun
had
spread
out
a
delicious
luncheon
in
the
barn
and
then
they
were
divided
between
hunger
and
the
wish
to
tell
about
their
birds
i
have
two
nice
birds
all
written
down
said
dodo
between
mouthfuls
one
was
rather
little
and
sort
of
green
on
top
and
white
underneath
and
he
kept
going
up
and
down
all
the
branches
of
an
oak
tree
as
if
he
could
keep
still
a
moment
and
he
talked
all
the
while
as
if
he
was
asking
me
why
i
watched
him
and
then
scolding
me
for
doing
it
that
is
the
vireo
said
the
doctor
maybe
he
did
have
red
eyes
said
dodo
but
he
moved
so
quick
i
could
see
them
but
my
other
bird
was
splendid
very
bright
red
all
over
except
his
wings
and
tail
they
were
black
and
i
sure
he
has
a
nest
high
up
on
an
oak
branch
that
is
the
scarlet
tanager
what
did
you
see
nat
i
crept
in
among
the
cedar
trees
and
there
was
a
whole
lot
of
rather
big
gray
birds
sitting
in
a
row
on
a
branch
they
had
black
around
their
beaks
and
their
head
feathers
stuck
up
in
front
they
did
seem
to
be
building
nests
but
were
only
whispering
to
each
other
those
were
cedar
waxwings
then
continued
nat
when
i
was
coming
back
i
saw
a
flock
of
the
prettiest
jolliest
little
birds
flying
round
the
old
grass
and
hanging
on
to
some
stalks
of
weeds
they
were
mostly
yellow
with
some
black
and
they
sang
something
like
canaries
and
when
they
flew
they
sort
of
jerked
along
those
were
american
goldfinches
and
now
for
yours
rap
i
was
looking
at
the
barn
swallows
most
of
the
time
he
answered
and
thinking
there
must
be
a
good
many
different
cousins
in
their
family
then
i
went
down
to
the
pasture
and
saw
a
bird
i
never
noticed
before
who
flew
over
from
the
potato
field
and
went
into
a
thorn
bush
he
was
bigger
than
a
robin
and
had
a
thick
head
and
beak
he
was
black
and
white
on
top
but
when
he
went
by
i
saw
he
had
a
beautiful
spot
on
the
breast
like
a
shield
sort
of
pink
red
the
color
of
raspberries
you
know
that
was
the
grosbeak
said
the
doctor
now
we
have
pockets
full
of
material
for
bird
stories
enough
to
last
a
week
by
the
time
you
have
heard
about
these
six
birds
and
some
of
their
near
relations
such
as
the
butcher
bird
you
will
have
been
introduced
to
the
chief
of
the
birds
that
sing
and
be
on
the
way
to
those
that
only
croak
and
call
we
will
begin
with
dodo
bird
the
vireo
the
talker
this
bird
is
the
most
popular
member
of
his
family
and
he
has
twenty
brothers
all
living
in
north
america
is
he
a
warbler
asked
rap
i
always
thought
he
was
one
for
he
fusses
round
the
trees
the
same
as
they
do
though
of
course
he
has
much
more
of
a
song
he
belongs
to
a
family
of
his
own
but
yours
was
an
easy
mistake
to
make
for
the
difference
is
not
readily
seen
except
in
the
beak
and
you
have
to
look
at
that
very
closely
to
see
it
the
warblers
mostly
have
smooth
slender
beaks
but
the
vireos
have
stouter
ones
with
a
little
hooked
point
that
enables
them
to
pick
out
and
secure
a
great
variety
of
insects
the
chat
is
our
only
warbler
with
a
very
stout
beak
even
stouter
than
a
vireo
but
it
has
no
hook
at
the
end
the
has
a
hooked
point
but
the
rest
of
the
beak
is
very
broad
and
flat
with
a
row
of
stiff
bristles
at
each
corner
of
the
mouth
to
keep
insects
from
kicking
free
when
they
are
caught
illustration
vireo
you
say
his
eyes
are
red
but
why
is
his
name
does
that
mean
anything
comes
from
the
latin
word
meaning
and
because
all
of
this
family
have
greenish
backs
one
of
their
common
names
is
besides
being
very
pretty
to
look
at
this
little
bird
is
a
great
worker
and
does
whatever
he
undertakes
in
a
most
complete
manner
when
he
starts
his
tree
trapping
in
the
morning
he
does
not
flit
carelessly
from
one
tree
to
another
but
after
selecting
his
feeding
ground
goes
all
over
one
branch
never
leaving
it
for
another
until
he
has
searched
every
crack
and
leaf
meanwhile
he
carries
on
a
rapid
conversation
sometimes
for
his
own
benefit
and
sometimes
to
cheer
his
mate
on
the
nest
for
this
vireo
is
one
of
the
few
birds
who
talk
too
freely
about
their
homes
these
homes
of
theirs
are
another
proof
of
industry
they
are
beautifully
woven
of
a
dozen
kinds
of
stuff
grass
fine
shavings
and
sometimes
bits
of
colored
paper
and
worsted
and
half
hang
from
the
crotch
of
a
small
branch
with
a
nice
little
umbrella
of
leaves
to
cover
madam
head
there
she
sits
peeping
out
not
a
bit
shy
if
she
feels
that
your
intentions
toward
her
are
kindly
i
have
often
found
these
nests
in
the
orchard
on
branches
only
a
few
feet
from
the
ground
and
i
have
also
found
them
high
up
in
the
maples
by
the
attic
window
the
vireo
does
not
stop
work
at
noon
when
the
field
hands
lie
under
the
apple
trees
with
their
dinner
pails
beside
them
no
he
only
works
and
talks
faster
keeping
one
eye
on
the
home
branch
and
this
is
what
he
says
stopping
between
every
sentence
know
it
i
made
it
would
you
think
it
must
touch
it
should
like
it
if
you
do
it
i
know
it
you
rue
it
he
was
talking
exactly
like
that
this
morning
said
dodo
will
the
nests
last
after
they
are
empty
uncle
roy
so
we
can
find
some
yes
surely
these
nests
are
very
strong
and
firm
often
lasting
a
whole
year
i
know
it
i
made
it
would
you
think
it
called
a
musical
voice
from
the
wood
why
he
is
at
it
yet
said
rap
i
think
talker
would
be
a
fine
name
for
him
so
it
would
and
more
polite
than
preacher
as
some
call
him
who
think
he
is
a
trifle
too
prosy
in
his
remarks
one
of
his
brothers
whose
eyes
are
white
instead
of
red
and
who
lives
in
the
bushes
instead
of
high
woods
is
called
politician
from
his
fondness
for
newspapers
not
that
he
can
read
them
of
course
but
he
likes
to
paper
his
nest
with
clippings
from
them
which
is
his
way
of
making
a
the
vireo
length
about
six
inches
upper
parts
with
a
white
line
over
the
eye
and
gray
cap
with
a
black
border
under
parts
white
shaded
with
greenish
on
the
sides
a
summer
citizen
of
north
america
east
of
the
pacific
states
and
a
member
of
the
guild
of
tree
trappers
the
great
northern
shrike
or
butcher
bird
i
thought
you
would
tell
about
my
beautiful
red
bird
next
interrupted
dodo
why
do
we
want
to
hear
about
this
bird
if
he
lives
so
far
north
your
bird
will
come
later
on
little
girl
nat
and
rap
must
each
have
their
turn
before
it
comes
to
you
again
besides
this
shrike
is
a
sort
of
cousin
to
the
vireos
by
right
of
his
hooked
beak
and
you
know
i
am
trying
to
place
our
birds
somewhat
in
their
regular
family
order
poor
dodo
felt
ashamed
to
have
seemed
selfish
and
interrupted
unnecessarily
some
winter
or
early
spring
day
when
the
woods
are
bare
and
birds
are
very
scarce
you
will
look
into
a
small
tree
and
wonder
what
that
gray
and
black
bird
who
is
sitting
there
so
motionless
can
be
he
is
too
small
for
a
hawk
though
there
is
something
about
his
head
he
is
altogether
too
large
for
a
chickadee
not
the
right
shape
for
a
woodpecker
and
after
thus
thinking
over
the
most
familiar
winter
birds
you
will
find
that
you
only
know
what
he
is
illustration
northern
shrike
suddenly
he
spreads
his
wings
and
swoops
down
seizing
something
on
or
near
the
ground
a
mouse
perhaps
or
a
small
bird
let
us
hope
one
of
the
detestable
english
sparrows
or
else
you
may
see
this
same
bird
in
the
gray
and
black
uniform
peep
cautiously
out
of
a
bush
and
then
skim
along
close
above
the
ground
to
secure
the
he
has
been
watching
for
the
guild
of
wise
watchers
catch
their
prey
in
both
of
these
ways
and
most
of
them
are
cannibal
birds
what
is
a
cannibal
bird
asked
dodo
i
forget
i
know
that
real
cannibals
are
people
that
eat
other
people
do
these
birds
eat
people
they
eat
birds
and
other
small
animals
said
rap
do
you
remember
why
of
course
i
do
said
dodo
but
if
shrikes
eat
birds
are
they
very
bad
citizens
i
do
not
wonder
that
you
think
so
my
lassie
and
so
they
would
be
if
they
ate
birds
only
but
the
shrike
earns
his
right
to
be
thought
a
good
citizen
by
devouring
mice
and
many
kinds
of
insects
like
beetles
which
injure
orchards
and
gardens
the
comparatively
few
birds
that
he
destroys
are
mostly
not
the
most
valuable
kinds
to
the
farmer
in
fact
the
shrike
is
especially
useful
in
helping
us
to
drive
out
the
greedy
quarrelsome
english
sparrow
this
disreputable
tramp
not
only
does
no
work
for
his
taxes
he
hates
honest
work
like
all
vagrants
but
destroys
the
buds
of
trees
and
plants
devours
our
grain
crops
and
drives
away
the
industrious
native
birds
who
are
good
citizens
so
the
wise
men
who
have
tried
the
sparrow
case
say
that
he
is
a
very
bad
bird
who
ought
to
suffer
the
extreme
penalty
of
the
law
for
this
reason
we
must
forgive
the
shrike
if
he
takes
a
few
other
birds
when
he
is
hungry
and
in
a
hurry
he
has
a
strange
habit
which
has
earned
for
him
the
name
of
butcher
bird
if
at
any
time
he
secures
more
food
than
he
needs
for
his
immediate
use
he
puts
it
by
to
keep
in
storage
by
hanging
it
on
the
frozen
twigs
of
a
tree
or
thorn
bush
heart
of
nature
has
doubtless
taught
him
this
habit
through
hard
experience
where
the
shrike
spends
his
winters
the
is
variable
it
may
snow
for
days
and
days
when
he
can
find
nothing
to
eat
so
he
has
learned
to
store
up
provisions
when
the
hunting
is
good
and
of
course
such
a
thrifty
bird
may
sometimes
save
up
more
than
he
really
needs
you
may
know
this
shrike
on
sight
without
hearing
him
sing
and
perhaps
you
do
not
expect
a
cannibal
bird
to
be
a
singer
but
in
late
march
and
early
april
when
he
is
about
to
take
his
homeward
journey
to
the
north
he
often
warbles
beautifully
and
even
brings
in
some
mocking
notes
until
you
would
think
that
a
catbird
thrasher
or
mockingbird
must
have
wandered
from
the
south
too
soon
and
if
you
ever
happen
to
see
a
shrike
and
a
mocker
close
together
you
may
mistake
one
for
the
other
they
look
so
much
alike
at
a
little
distance
i
never
knew
that
there
were
nice
birds
around
in
winter
said
nat
i
thought
all
the
country
was
good
for
then
was
for
coasting
and
skating
i
wish
i
could
stay
here
a
whole
year
uncle
roy
stranger
things
have
happened
said
the
doctor
looking
at
olive
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
that
the
children
did
not
see
the
great
northern
shrike
length
about
ten
inches
upper
parts
with
a
broad
black
stripe
along
the
side
of
the
head
to
behind
the
eye
black
wings
with
a
large
white
spot
on
each
black
tail
with
white
tips
to
the
outside
feathers
lower
parts
faintly
barred
with
darker
a
great
strong
beak
hooked
like
a
hawk
only
a
winter
visitor
in
the
united
states
a
summer
citizen
of
the
far
north
belongs
both
to
the
ground
gleaners
and
the
wise
watchers
the
cedar
waxwing
the
polite
bird
this
is
the
bird
nat
that
you
saw
in
the
cedar
tree
where
you
said
it
was
about
doing
nothing
continued
the
doctor
the
reason
of
this
seeming
idleness
is
that
he
belongs
to
the
small
group
of
birds
who
do
not
nest
until
june
and
hereabouts
rarely
begin
their
homes
before
the
middle
of
that
month
waxwings
are
very
gentle
affectionate
birds
before
the
nesting
season
and
after
their
families
are
able
to
take
care
of
themselves
they
wander
about
in
flocks
of
sometimes
thirty
or
forty
keeping
close
together
both
when
they
fly
and
when
they
take
their
seats
they
spend
most
of
the
time
in
the
trees
where
they
feed
whispering
to
one
another
in
their
quiet
way
and
you
will
very
seldom
see
them
on
the
ground
your
best
chance
to
watch
them
is
either
before
the
leaves
are
out
or
after
they
have
fallen
when
a
flock
will
sometimes
sit
for
half
an
hour
in
a
bare
tree
exchanging
civilities
stroking
each
other
feathers
and
passing
food
around
this
trait
has
given
them
the
reputation
of
being
the
most
polite
birds
in
all
birdland
one
will
find
a
dainty
morsel
and
offer
it
to

the
swallows
has
been
watching
the
barn
swallows
continued
the
doctor
after
the
children
had
been
over
to
the
cedar
belt
to
see
if
the
flock
of
polite
birds
were
there
still
he
thinks
there
are
a
great
many
cousins
in
the
swallow
family
but
ca
tell
them
apart
there
are
ten
species
of
north
american
swallows
four
of
which
are
very
familiar
birds
in
all
parts
of
the
united
states
these
are
the
purple
martin
barn
swallow
tree
swallow
and
bank
swallow
as
a
family
it
is
easy
to
name
the
swallows
from
their
way
of
flying
all
are
officers
who
rank
high
in
the
guild
of
sky
sweepers
being
constantly
in
the
air
seizing
their
insect
food
on
the
wing
thus
they
kill
all
sorts
of
flies
flying
ants
small
winged
beetles
midges
and
mosquitoes
they
have
lithe
and
shapely
bodies
strong
slender
wings
wide
mouths
and
flat
broad
bills
coming
to
a
sharp
point
which
makes
it
easy
for
them
to
secure
whatever
they
meet
in
the
air
so
swift
and
sure
is
their
flight
that
they
can
feed
their
newly
flown
nestlings
in
mid
air
but
their
feet
are
small
and
weak
so
that
in
perching
they
usually
choose
something
small
and
easy
to
grasp
like
a
telegraph
wire
though
they
nest
in
all
parts
of
the
country
some
species
going
to
the
fur
countries
as
far
north
as
any
trees
grow
yet
they
all
seek
a
very
warm
climate
for
their
winter
home
because
it
is
only
in
such
places
that
the
insects
of
the
air
are
found
the
distance
therefore
between
the
summer
and
winter
homes
of
the
swallow
family
is
very
great
and
these
brave
little
birds
are
wonderful
travellers
they
are
so
swift
on
the
wing
that
they
do
not
fear
to
fly
in
the
and
so
escape
a
great
many
of
the
accidents
that
overtake
birds
who
travel
by
night
they
come
to
the
middle
parts
of
the
united
states
during
the
month
of
april
and
start
on
their
southward
journey
during
late
september
and
early
october
after
mating
they
either
choose
separate
nesting
places
or
keep
together
in
colonies
in
early
autumn
they
gather
in
great
flocks
along
the
borders
of
rivers
ponds
and
lakes
often
also
on
sea
beaches
where
they
fly
to
and
fro
as
if
strengthening
their
wings
for
the
long
flight
they
intend
to
take
it
has
been
recently
discovered
by
the
wise
men
that
these
birds
who
had
been
supposed
to
eat
nothing
but
insects
feed
at
this
time
upon
the
same
bayberries
of
which
the
warbler
is
so
fond
and
that
is
one
reason
why
they
stay
by
the
sandy
wastes
where
these
bushes
grow
but
no
doubt
rap
could
have
told
us
that
if
we
had
asked
him
about
it
another
reason
for
lingering
near
water
is
that
winged
insects
fly
about
wet
places
later
in
the
season
than
they
do
in
dry
ones
but
you
have
left
out
the
chimney
swallow
said
nat
and
there
are
plenty
of
them
all
about
everywhere
i
have
not
left
him
out
have
you
forgotten
that
he
does
not
belong
to
the
swallow
family
though
he
looks
like
a
swallow
and
flies
like
one
the
wise
men
know
that
he
is
not
a
song
bird
and
have
put
him
where
he
belongs
with
the
birds
that
croak
and
call
next
to
the
hummingbird
and
nighthawk
they
call
him
the
chimney
swift
because
he
flies
so
fast
and
you
must
always
give
him
his
right
name
if
you
write
very
carefully
in
your
little
books
the
description
of
our
four
common
swallows
you
will
not
find
it
difficult
to
name
them

you
see
them

will

is

called

did
somebody
named
martin
find
it
as
wilson
found
the
thrush
they
named
after
him
no
my
boy
the
name
comes
from
a
latin
word
meaning
or
because
in
the
old
world
certain
swallows
there
called
martins
were
considered
good
fighters
and
very
brave

away

i
never

the
looks

scarlet
tanager
you
are
quite
lucky
to
have
seen
a
scarlet
tanager
in
his
home
woods
said
the
doctor
for
he
is
a
shy
bird
who
does
not
often
venture
to
show
his
tropical
colors
in
open
places
he
knows
enough
not
to
make
himself
a
target
for
cannibal
birds
or
house
people
either
except
in
his
journeys
to
and
from
his
winter
home
he
lives
in
the
shelter
of
the
tallest
forest
trees
where
it
is
very
difficult
to
see
him
showy
as
he
is
in
his
flashing
colors
and
even
if
you
know
by
his
song
that
he
is
there
he
may
say
as
some
people
think
he
does
wait
wait
wait
for
me
wait
but
he
does
not
wait
a
moment
if
he
thinks
he
is
seen
he
is
very
fond
of
water
both
for
bathing
and
drinking
and
seldom
nests
far
from
it
whether
he
uses
the
quiet
ponds
and
smooth
streams
also
for
a
to
comb
his
hair
and
arrange
his
gay
coat
by
we
can
not
be
sure
but
he
always
looks
as
trig
as
if
he
had
some
such
aid
the
tanager
children
are
curious
things
sometimes
they
wear
coats
of
many
colors
like
joseph
why
is
that
asked
nat
the
reason
is
this
you
remember
i
told
you
that
young
birds
usually
wear
plain
feathers
like
their
mothers
oh
yes
said
rap
so
that
it
is
hard
to
see
them
until
they
have
sense
enough
to
take
care
of
themselves
precisely
now
mother
tanager
is
greenish
and
yellow
and
father
tanager
is
scarlet
and
black
the
young
ones
come
from
the
nest
looking
like
their
mother
but
as
they
shed
their
baby
clothes
and
gain
new
feathers
bits
of
red
and
black
appear
here
and
there
on
the
little
boys
until
they
look
as
if
they
had
on
a
of
red
yellow
green
and
black
you
need
not
wonder
that
little
tommy
tanager
does
not
care
to
be
seen
in
such
patched
clothes
but
prefers
to
stay
in
the
deep
woods
or
travel
away
until
his
fine
red
spring
jacket
is
complete
father
tanager
also
changes
his
scarlet
coat
after
the
nesting
about
the
time
he
counts
his
children
and
starts
on
his
southward
trip
he
puts
on
a
greenish
coat
like
his
wife
gown
but
he
keeps
his
black
tail
and
wings
so
that
the
children
need
not
mistake
him
for
their
mother
it
is
lucky
for
her
that
he
and
the
boys
have
sense
enough
to
put
on
their
own
clothes
or
such
a
very
dressy
family
would
keep
her
busy
looking
after
their
toilets
these
tanagers
are
very
plenty
about
here
are
they
doctor
asked
rap
not
now
my
boy
their
scarlet
feathers
are
very
handsome
and
thoughtless
greedy
people
have
shot
so
many
in
the
nesting
season
to
sell
for
bonnet
trimmings
that
the
family
is
growing
small
but
i
hope
that
by
making
laws
to
protect
birds
and
teaching
children
everywhere
what
good
neighbors
and
citizens
they
are
these
beautifully
plumed
families
may
increase

more
the
scarlet

is
the
brightest
red
bird
that
you
will
find
in

the

pleasantly
that
is

the
only
one
i
ever
saw
in

neighbourhood
it
is
so
rare
here
that
i
shot
it
to
make
sure
there
was
no
mistake
and
you
probably
never
saw
one
alive

the

do

out

he
had

occasion

could
not

answered
the

thought
i
would
like
to
have
it
for
my
collection
because
it
came
from
the
very
region
where
this
kind
of
tanager
was
discovered
almost
a
hundred
years
ago
i
thought
you
said
it
was
a
louisiana
tanager
said
rap
and
nat
almost
in
the
same
breath
so
it
is
boys
but
it
does
not
live
in
the
state
of
louisiana
you
are
thinking
about
down
by
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
river
i
shall
have
to
explain
how
it
got
its
name
by
giving
you
a
little
lesson
in
the
history
and
geography
of
our
country
a
great
many
years
ago
there
was
a
king
of
france
called
louis
the
fourteenth
and
during
his
reign
all
the
western
parts
of
america
that
the
french
had
discovered
or
acquired
any
claim
to
were
named
louisiana
in
his
honor
by
one
of
the
missionaries
who
came
over
to
convert
the
indians
to
christianity
after
a
good
many
years
more
about
the
beginning
of
this
century
president
jefferson
bought
all
this
immense
country
from
napoleon
bonaparte
and
that
made
it
a
part
of
the
united
states
every
part
of
them
that
is
now
ours
from
the
mississippi
river
to
the
pacific
ocean
except
some
that
we
afterward
took
from
mexico
president
jefferson
was
a
very
wise
man
and
as
soon
as
he
had
bought
all
this
land
he
wanted
to
know
about
it
so
he
sent
an
expedition
to
explore
it
under
two
brave
captains
named
lewis
and
clark
they
were
gone
almost
three
years
and
one
day
i
remember
now
it
was
the
sixth
of
june
when
they
were
camping
in
what
is
now
idaho
near
the
border
of
oregon
they
found
this
lovely
bird
and
wrote
a
description
of
it
in
their
just
as
you
did
with
your
scarlet
tanager
dodo
only
theirs
was
the
first
one
anybody
ever
wrote
they
also
saved
the
specimen
and
afterward
gave
it
to
alexander
wilson
who
painted
the
first
picture
of
it
and
named
it
the
louisiana
tanager
in
his
book
did
you
ever
see
one
alive
uncle
roy
asked
nat
what
does
it
look
like
flying
i
can
answer
that
question
said
olive
do
you
remember
father
when
we
were
in
colorado
the
same
year
we
found
the
sage
thrasher
and
rock
wren
that
i
thought
the
first
one
we
saw
was
a
scarlet
tanager
in
one
of
its
plumages
till
you
told
me
about
it
though
it
did
seem
to
be
too
bright
yellow
and
the
middle
of
the
back
was
black
but
it
looked
the
same
size
and
flew
just
the
same
how
beautiful
it
looked
as
it
flashed
its
golden
feathers
through
the
pine
trees
added
olive
her
face
lighting
up
at
the
recollection
yes
i
remember
answered
the
doctor
all
the
tanagers
of
our
country
have
pretty
much
the
same
habits
even
if
we
had
found
the
nest
we
might
have
mistaken
it
for
a
scarlet
tanager
those
i
have
seen
in
the
museum
are
quite
similar
built
of
twigs
and
pliant
stems
and
lined
with
fine
rootlets
the
position
of
the
nest
saddled
as
it
is
on
the
horizontal
limb
of
a
tree
is
very
similar
and
you
could
hardly
tell
the
eggs
apart
but
come
children
you
must
be
tired
by
this
time
and
hungry
too
let
us
go
to
supper
and
see
what
mammy
bun
has
cooked
for
us
this
evening
you
stay

as
the
scarlet

a

of
weed
warriors
containing
both
soldiers
and
quakers
a
new
family
soldiers
and
quakers
what
does
that
mean
asked
nat
i
thought
my
jolly
yellow
bird
with
the
black
cap
came
next
his
family
does
come
next
the
finch
family
you
must
hear
a
little
about
that
first
and
let
your
american
goldfinch
take
his
turn
with
his
brothers
and
cousins
for
rap
grosbeak
belongs
also
in
this
family
you
say
my
bird
is
called
american
goldfinch
he
is
such
a
bright
yellow
that
gold
is
a
good
name
for
him
but
what
does
mean
finch
as
i
said
is
the
name
of
the
great
family
to
which
he
belongs
it
is
the
very
largest
family
in
birdland
and
members
of
it
live
in
almost
all
parts
of
the
world
all
kinds
of
finches
and
sparrows
belong
to
it
and
so
do
grosbeaks
and
buntings
as
well
as
the
canaries
that
we
keep
for
pets
there
are
about
five
hundred
and
fifty
different
kinds
of
them
the
birds
that
you
have
been
studying
thus
far
from
the
bluebird
robin
and
wood
thrush
to
the
tanagers
belong
to
several
different
families
and
are
chiefly
taking
various
fruits
and
berries
in
season
it
is
true
but
making
insects
their
regular
diet
insects
are
not
hard
for
any
bird
to
eat
and
so
the
bills
of
these
birds
do
not
have
to
be
very
stout
or
thick
some
indeed
are
very
thin
and
weak
like
the
brown
creeper
but
the
habits
of
the
finch
family
are
quite
different
and
their
beaks
also
they
are
true
birds
and
their
beaks
are
short
stout
and
thick
it
is
called
like
that
of
the
sparrow
you
learned
about
one
day
this
enables
them
to
crack
the
various
seeds
upon
which
they
live
at
all
times
except
in
the
nesting
season
when
few
seeds
are
ripe
during
this
time
they
eat
a
variety
of
insects
and
feed
them
to
the
young
birds
for
young
birds
must
grow
so
rapidly
in
order
to
be
strong
enough
for
the
autumn
journey
that
they
require
more
nourishing
food
than
seeds
the
finch
family
being
able
to
live
so
well
upon
seed
food
do
not
have
to
make
such
long
autumn
journeys
for
even
in
very
cold
places
there
are
plenty
of
seeds
to
be
had
all
through
the
winter
do
you
mean
berries
please
uncle
said
dodo
because
if
it
was
very
cold
would
berries
freeze
as
hard
as
pebbles
they
eat
berries
but
only
as
weed
warriors
for
the
seeds
that
are
in
the
berries
not
for
the
juicy
fruity
part
as
the
seed
sowers
do
the
robin
thrush
and
catbird
eat
fruits
and
berries
for
the
juicy
pulpy
part
they
swallow
this
and
the
seeds
or
pits
pass
out
with
the
wastage
of
their
bodies
this
is
what
makes
them
seed
sowers
but
when
one
of
the
finch
family
eats
berries
it
is
for
the
seed
or
pit
inside
the
pulp
his
strong
beak
cracks
the
seed
and
his
stomach
digests
its
kernel
so
these
birds
do
not
the
seeds
they
eat
but
them
this
is
why
i
call
them
weed
warriors
a
warrior
is
any
one
who
goes
to
war
and
fights
against
enemies
we
have
enemies
among
plants
and
these
birds
fight
for
us
against
them
there
are
hundreds
of
different
kinds
of
plants
whose
flowers
have
no
beauty
and
for
which
we
have
not
as
yet
found
any
use
so
we
call
them
weeds
all
such
seeds
would
be
blown
about
take
root
and
sprout
everywhere
thus
filling
the
place
of
useful
plants
if
they
were
not
held
in
check
by
these
birds
is
it
wise
the
ways
things
are
fixed
said
rap
some
birds
to
eat
the
insects
and
sow
wild
fruits
and
berries
some
birds
to
eat
weed
seeds
and
prevent
them
from
being
sown
i
think
some
people
would
do
better
if
they
did
think
themselves
so
smart
and
mix
things
all
up
you
are
right
my
boy
we
should
not
interfere
with
heart
of
nature
by
foolishly
trying
to
aid
him
unless
we
are
perfectly
sure
that
he
wishes
and
needs
our
help
there
is
one
member
of
this
finch
family
the
european
sparrow
that
we
know
by
the
name
of
english
sparrow
in
his
native
country
he
eats
both
insects
and
seeds
and
also
does
some
good
by
eating
certain
a
number
of
years
ago
the
trees
in
our
cities
were
being
eaten
by
and
some
one
said
us
bring
over
some
of
these
sparrows
to
live
in
the
cities
and
eat
the
this
person
meant
well
but
he
did
not
know
enough
about
what
he
was
doing
the
birds
were
brought
and
for
a
while
they
ate
the
worms
and
stayed
near
cities
but
soon
the
change
in
climate
also
changed
their
liking
for
insects
and
they
became
almost
wholly
seed
and
vegetable
eaters
devouring
the
young
buds
on
vines
and
trees
oats
rye
wheat
and
other
grains
worse
than
this
they
increased
very
fast
and
spread
everywhere
quarrelling
with
and
driving
out
the
good
citizens
who
belong
to
the
regular
birdland
guilds
taking
their
homes
and
making
themselves
nuisances
the
wise
men
protested
against
bringing
these
sparrows
but
no
one
heeded
their
warning
until
it
was
too
late
now
it
is
decided
that
these
sparrows
are
bad
citizens
and
criminals
so
they
are
condemned
by
every
one
all
this
trouble
came
because
one
man
as
rap
says
he
was
so
smart
and
mixed
things
up
it
was
those
sparrows
in
the
city
that
made
me
think
all
wild
birds
must
be
ugly
but
that
was
because
was
too
smart
and
did
know
anything
about
other
birds
said
nat
frankly
i
think
we
are
getting
way
off
from
nat
yellow
bird
said
dodo
and
now
i
see
lots
more
of
rap
grosbeaks
over
on
the
fence
i
want
to
know
what
they
are
doing
in
the
potato
field
i
hope
they
do
dig
up
the
little
potatoes
no
you
need
not
worry
about
that
said
the
doctor
and
you
must
wait
a
bit
yet
for
the
does
not
come
until
nearly
the
end
of
his
family
there
must
be
a
great
many
birds
in
this
finch
family
said
rap
if
plain
sparrows
and
yellow
goldfinches
both
belong
to
it
indeed
there
are
did
i
not
say
that
there
were
both
quakers
and
soldiers
in
it
said
the
doctor
for
in
addition
to
the
goldfinch
there
is
a
cousin
and
a
red
one
what
are
their
names
and
shall
we
see
them
here
cried
dodo
you
will
learn
their
names
very
soon
the
blue
one
now
has
a
nest
across
the
meadow
and
the
red
one
makes
us
a
visit
every
autumn
but
you
must
stop
asking
questions
if
you
want
to
hear
about
them
the
first
of
the
finch
family
is
a
bird
you
will
only
see
in
the
winter
and
not
even
then
if
you
are
living
further
south
than
the
middle
range
of
states
it
is
called
the
pine
grosbeak
the
pine
grosbeak
this
bird
has
a
great
heavy
beak
that
makes
him
look
rather
stupid
in
fact
this
beak
gives
him
the
name
of
which
means
the
same
as
he
loves
the
pine
woods
of
canada
and
builds
his
nest
among
them
only
a
little
way
above
the
snow
that
still
covers
the
ground
at
the
early
season
when
this
bird
begins
housekeeping
when
the
northern
winter
is
very
severe
pine
grosbeaks
gather
in
flocks
and
scatter
through
the
states
but
you
must
not
expect
to
see
a
whole
flock
of
beautiful
birds
for
only
the
old
males
are
red
the
females
are
dull
gray
and
yellowish
while
the
young
males
look
like
their
mothers
and
do
not
wear
their
gay
coats
until
they
are
two
years
old
you
will
not
be
likely
to
hear
these
birds
sing
though
they
sometimes
do
so
on
their
winter
trips
their
usual
is
a
whistle
which
they
give
when
flying
illustration
pine
grosbeak
some
day
this
winter
when
you
are
taking
a
walk
you
may
see
them
on
the
ground
under
chestnut
and
beech
trees
and
in
old
pastures
where
the
red
sumach
berries
are
the
only
bright
things
left
above
the
snow
you
will
think
it
a
very
cheerful
sight
red
birds
and
red
berries
together
you
will
also
have
time
to
take
a
good
look
at
them
for
they
move
slowly
and
be
glad
to
know
the
names
of
your
friends
who
are
hardy
enough
to
brave
the
cold
though
this
grosbeak
seems
rather
dull
and
stupid
out
of
doors
he
is
a
charming
cage
pet
growing
tame
and
singing
a
delightful
warbling
song
i
picked
up
one
with
a
broken
wing
when
i
was
a
boy
and
kept
him
for
many
years
the
hurt
wing
was
soon
healed
and
the
bird
was
always
tame
and
happy
after
that
though
he
soon
lost
his
bright
feathers
but
i
would
never
advise
any
one
to
make
a
cage
pet
of
a
bird
who
has
been
born
wild
and
once
known
liberty
no
matter
if
he
lives
and
thrives
he
will
sometimes
remember
the
days
when
he
was
free
and
be
very
sad
my
canary
is
never
sad
said
nat
he
is
always
singing
for
very
many
years
canaries
have
been
bred
in
cages
to
be
pets
and
as
these
have
never
been
wild
they
are
used
to
cage
life
they
are
the
best
birds
for
pets
because
they
are
and
it
is
easy
to
supply
the
food
they
like
some
winter
day
or
even
late
in
autumn
you
may
see
on
your
walks
another
red
bird
a
near
relation
of
the
pine
grosbeak
in
fact
the
two
often
flock
together
this
bird
is
called
the
american
crossbill
the
pine
grosbeak
length
about
nine
inches
general
color
of
adult
male
the
wings
and
tail
dark
with
some
and
white
edgings
the
tail
forked
a
little
the
female
and
young
male
gray
tinged
here
and
there
with
a
summer
citizen
as
far
north
from
the
states
as
trees
grow
roving
in
winter
about
the
northerly
and
middle
states
a
fine
large
weed
warrior
with
a
very
stout
beak
almost
like
a
parrot
the
american
crossbill
the
cone
wrencher
when
it
is
winter
in
the
northern
parts
of
north
america
and
the
great
snow
owls
have
scattered
on
their
southward
journey
when
heavy
snows
have
beaten
down
and
covered
the
of
weeds
and
walled
the
little
beasts
into
their
holes
then
in
regions
where
march
brings
only
storms
of
sleet
to
coat
the
and
lock
up
insect
food
a
pair
of
strange
birds
are
already
building
their
nest
these
two
birds
though
alike
in
shape
are
as
different
in
color
as
and
scarlet
tanager
but
there
is
one
point
about
them
by
which
you
may
tell
them
from
any
others
their
curving
bills
are
at
the
which
strange
arrangement
gives
them
their
name
of
crossbill
at
a
little
distance
you
might
mistake
them
for
paroquets
but
only
the
upper
half
of
a
paroquet
beak
is
curved
and
it
closes
over
the
under
half
while
both
parts
of
the
crossbill
beak
are
curved
and
they
cross
each
other
at
the
tip
like
a
pair
of
scissors
that
do
not
close
properly
illustration
american
crossbill
how
and
where
do
you
think
these
birds
build
their
nests
in
such
a
cold
season
make
a
burrow
in
the
snow
perhaps
said
dodo
go
into
a
haystack
or
under
a
shed
said
nat
or
a
hole
in
a
tree
added
rap
no
the
crossbill
does
not
place
his
nest
in
any
of
these
ways
he
chooses
a
thick
evergreen
tree
and
upon
the
fork
of
one
of
the
branches
makes
a
little
platform
of
rubbish
to
support
the
nest
with
great
care
the
couple
gather
shreds
of
bark
twigs
and
small
sticks
till
they
think
they
have
enough
then
they
begin
the
nest
itself
weaving
it
of
softer
materials
and
lining
it
with
grasses
fur
and
feathers
until
they
make
a
very
comfortable
bed
for
the
eggs
to
lie
in
how
cold
the
poor
birds
toes
must
be
while
they
are
working
said
dodo
with
a
shiver
and
i
should
think
the
eggs
would
freeze
instead
of
hatching
but
what
do
they
find
to
eat
when
everything
is
frozen
stiff
asked
rap
are
they
cannibal
birds
that
can
eat
other
birds
and
mice
these
two
questions
can
be
answered
together
said
the
doctor
the
nests
are
usually
built
in
evergreens
which
are
or
coniferous
trees
you
all
know
what
a
cone
is
like
i
think
yes
i
do
cried
rap
it
is
a
long
seed
pod
that
grows
on
evergreens
in
summer
it
is
green
and
sticky
but
by
and
by
it
grows
dry
and
brown
and
divides
into
little
rows
of
scales
like
shingles
on
a
house
and
there
is
a
seed
hidden
under
each
scale
each
kind
of
an
evergreen
has
a
cone
some
are
long
and
smooth
like
sausages
and
some
are
thick
and
pointed
like
a
top
the
squirrels
often
pick
the
cones
off
the
spruces
over
at
the
miller
and
shell
out
the
scales
just
as
you
shell
corn
off
the
cob
to
get
the
seeds
very
good
my
boy
said
the
doctor
i
see
you
know
something
about
trees
as
well
as
birds
the
crossbills
build
in
evergreens
and
all
around
their
nests
hang
the
cones
with
spicy
seeds
stored
away
under
the
scales
ready
for
the
birds
to
eat
so
they
do
not
have
to
go
far
from
home
for
their
marketing
but
their
beaks
are
so
crooked
that
i
do
see
how
they
can
pick
out
the
cone
seeds
said
nat
these
curiously
twisted
bills
like
pincers
are
made
expressly
for
the
purpose
of
wrenching
the
scales
from
the
cones
so
that
the
seeds
are
laid
bare
it
very
funny
said
nat
whenever
we
think
a
bird
is
queer
or
awkward
and
would
be
better
in
some
other
way
it
is
sure
to
be
made
the
very
best
way
only
we
do
know
it
by
and
by
when
the
eggs
are
laid
and
the
young
are
hatched
continued
the
doctor
crossbills
make
the
most
devoted
parents
they
would
let
themselves
be
lifted
from
the
nest
rather
than
leave
their
family
and
when
it
is
midsummer
the
old
and
young
crossbills
form
into
flocks
then
the
parents
begin
to
think
that
the
young
people
need
a
change
of
air
for
their
health
and
a
few
months
of
travel
to
finish
their
education
so
they
wander
southward
through
the
states
without
any
method
or
plan
sometimes
going
as
far
as
new
orleans
before
winter
really
begins
and
it
is
on
these
journeys
that
we
see
them
some
frosty
morning
in
october
if
you
hear
a
sound
coming
from
the
sky
like
the
tinkling
of
little
bells
you
may
be
sure
there
is
a
flock
of
crossbills
near
and
soon
you
will
see
them
climbing
about
an
evergreen
or
quietly
picking
seeds
on
a
birch
or
beech
the
moment
before
they
move
to
another
tree
they
begin
to
call
this
is
the
only
note
you
will
be
likely
to
hear
from
them
and
one
which
they
often
keep
up
during
flight
they
are
capricious
birds
when
on
their
travels
sometimes
letting
you
come
very
near
them
without
showing
a
sign
of
fear
then
suddenly
taking
flight
and
dashing
about
in
a
distracted
way
they
are
also
tardy
in
getting
back
to
their
piney
homes
sometimes
and
choose
their
mates
on
the
journey
unlike
most
birds
very
often
a
thoughtless
couple
are
obliged
to
camp
out
and
build
a
home
wherever
they
happen
to
be
so
that
their
nests
have
been
found
in
several
of
the
new
england
states
is
there
only
one
kind
of
crossbill
in
north
america
asked
rap
no
this
red
crossbill
has
two
cousins
one
with
two
white
bars
on
each
wing
called
the
crossbill
who
sometimes
travels
with
him
but
is
rarer
and
another
who
lives
in
mexico
the
american
crossbill
length
about
six
inches
beak
crossed
at
the
tips
but
looking
like
a
parrot
if
you
do
not
notice
how
the
points
cross
male

indian
red

female

winter
excursions
all
through
the
united
states
the
american
goldfinch
the
jolly
bird
or
thistle
bird
this
must
be
my
other
bird
said
nat
the
yellow
one
from
the
wild
grass
meadow
who
had
what
looked
like
a
little
black
velvet
cap
tipped
down
over
his
eyes
they
are
such
jolly
little
chaps
that
it
made
me
laugh
when
i
watched
them
swinging
on
the
ends
of
the
tall
grass
once
in
a
while
one
would
play
he
was
angry
and
try
to
look
cross
but
he
could
keep
it
up
long
because
he
really
felt
so
good
natured
i
believe
every
one
knows
goldfinches
said
olive
i
remember
them
longer
than
any
birds
but
the
robin
and
bluebird
illustration
american
goldfinch
yes
for
even
i
know
them
a
little
bit
said
dodo
but
not
by
their
right
name
for
when
i
saw
some
in
the
park
last
summer
somebody
said
they
were
wild
canaries
that
had
flown
out
of
cages
what
do
they
eat
cones
or
little
seeds
asked
nat
they
eat
and
the
seeds
of
weeds
the
most
weeds
too
that
blow
everywhere
and
spread
ever
so
fast
said
rap
look
quick
there
a
flock
coming
by
now
and
they
are
calling
to
me
come
to
me
see
they
have
settled
on
the
long
grass
by
the
fence
and
are
gobbling
seeds
like
everything
continued
rap
in
a
whisper
as
he
spoke
a
flock
of
twenty
or
more
birds
flew
over
some
were
the
males
and
others
the
more
plainly
colored
females
they
did
not
fly
straight
but
in
a
jerky
way
constantly
dropping
down
and
then
lifting
up
again
and
calling
out
wait
for
me
on
every
curve
until
by
common
consent
they
alighted
among
some
wild
grasses
where
the
early
yellow
thistles
were
already
going
to
seed
watch
and
listen
said
the
doctor
as
he
handed
the
to
the
children
in
turn
there
was
a
perfect
babel
of
the
jaunty
blond
males
all
making
pretty
speeches
to
the
gentle
females
who
laughed
merry
little
in
return
it
is
like
the
noise
in
the
store
where
they
sell
canaries
whispered
nat
after
taking
a
long
look
first
they
all
sing
together
and
then
a
few
sing
so
much
louder
that
the
others
stop
i
wonder
what
they
are
saying
they
are
talking
about
housekeeping
said
the
doctor
some
of
the
ladies
say
they
prefer
high
apartments
in
a
while
others
like
bushes
the
best
but
all
agree
that
the
ground
floor
is
too
damp
for
the
health
of
their
families
in
a
few
days
or
a
week
at
most
this
merry
flock
will
have
parted
company
and
two
by
two
the
birds
will
begin
housekeeping
why
they
are
pulling
off
the
and
gobbling
it
up
i
should
think
it
would
choke
them
said
dodo
those
are
some
of
the
seeds
that
rap
spoke
of
a
moment
ago
the
fluff
is
not
the
seed
but
a
sort
of
sail
to
which
the
seed
is
fastened
that
the
wind
may
blow
it
away
to
another
place
to
grow
if
you
look
carefully
you
will
see
that
the
birds
do
not
eat
but
only
the
seed
they
will
soon
use
the
down
to
line
their
pretty
round
nests
oh
yes
said
dodo
there
are
lots
of
fluffy
seeds
and
they
mostly
belong
to
very
bad
weeds
olive
has
been
telling
us
about
them
uncle
roy
and
so
of
course
the
goldies
do
heaps
of
good
by
eating
them
if
they
eat
those
and
do
not
need
insects
they
can
live
here
all
winter
ca
they
uncle
certainly
they
gather
in
flocks
after
their
which
you
see
is
very
late
then
the
males
shed
their
feathers
and
look
exactly
like
their
wives
and
children
still
they
make
a
merry
party
flying
about
in
the
garden
and
field
edges
where
the
composite
flowers
have
left
them
food
whispering
and
giggling
all
day
long
even
singing
merrily
now
and
then
they
often
have
hard
times
in
winter
and
when
i
am
here
at
the
farm
i
always
scatter
canary
seed
on
the
snow
for
them
what
is
a
flower
asked
dodo
a
kind
of
flower
which
has
a
great
many
little
blossoms
crowded
together
in
a
bunch
so
that
they
look
like
one
big
flower
such
as
a
dandelion
thistle
or
sunflower
olive
will
tell
you
more
about
them
she
is
the
flower
lady
you
know
i
am
only
your
bird
uncle
and
if
i
mix
up
flowers
with
birds
i
shall
be
apt
to
confuse
you
they
eat
sunflower
seeds
said
rap
we
grow
these
seeds
for
our
hens
and
the
goldies
always
get
their
share
i
wonder
if
that
is
why
they
are
such
a
beautiful
yellow
said
dodo
sunflower
would
be
a
nice
name
for
them
no
you
need
laugh
at
me
nat
the
man
in
the
bird
store
said
he
gave
canaries
red
pepper
to
make
them
red
so
i
do
see
why
the
seed
of
yellow
sunflowers
should
make
birds
yellow
but
in
spite
of
her
argument
nat
and
rap
continued
to
laugh
it
must
be
hard
to
tell
them
when
they
lose
their
yellow
feathers
said
nat
finally
no
goldfinches
keep
up
a
habit
by
which
you
can
always
tell
them
old
or
young
male
or
female
in
summer
or
winter
can
you
guess
what
it
is
i
know
oh
i
know
cried
rap
they
always
fly
with
a
dip
and
a
jerk
the
american
goldfinch
length
about
five
inches
male
in
summer
bright
clear
yellow
with
a
black
cap
and
the
wings
and
tail
black
with
some
white
on
both
female
at
all
times
and
male
in
winter
light
flaxen
brown
the
wings
and
tail
as
before
but
less
distinctly
marked
with
white
and
no
black
cap
a
citizen
of
temperate
north
america
and
a
good
neighbor
belongs
to
the
guild
of
weed
warriors
and
is
very
useful
the
snowflake
the
autumn
leaf
it
is
a
very
warm
day
to
talk
about
snowstorms
and
winter
birds
but
several
of
these
birds
belong
to
the
finch
family
said
the
doctor
a
few
mornings
later
as
the
children
went
through
the
old
pasture
down
to
the
river
woods
in
search
of
a
cool
quiet
place
to
spend
the
morning
the
sun
was
hot
and
most
of
the
birds
were
hiding
in
the
shade
trees
but
as
the
snowflake
will
walk
next
to
the
goldfinch
in
the
procession
of
bird
families
i
am
going
to
show
you
after
a
while
we
must
have
him
now
i
think
a
cool
bird
will
be
very
nice
for
a
warm
day
said
dodo
something
like
soda
water
and
ice
cream
that
makes
me
think
mammy
bun
was
cracking
ice
this
morning
and
i
wonder
what
for
i
wonder
said
olive
laughing
i
know
said
nat
who
was
a
tease
it
must
be
to
bake
a
cake
with
illustration
snowflake
here
is
a
nice
place
for
us
said
the
doctor
who
had
walked
on
ahead
where
we
can
see
over
the
fields
and
into
the
woods
by
only
turning
our
heads
and
the
moss
is
so
dry
that
we
may
sit
anywhere
we
please
the
trees
are
in
full
leaf
now
he
continued
looking
up
as
he
leaned
comfortably
against
the
trunk
of
an
oak
that
spread
its
high
root
ridges
on
each
side
of
him
like
the
arms
of
a
chair
the
spring
flowers
are
gone
strawberries
are
ripe
and
there
is
plenty
of
food
and
shelter
for
birds
here
but
if
we
were
to
travel
northward
beyond
the
united
states
and
up
through
canada
we
should
find
that
the
trees
were
different
that
there
were
more
pines
and
spruces
then
if
we
went
still
further
north
even
these
would
begin
to
grow
more
scanty
and
stunted
until
the
low
pines
in
which
the
grosbeak
nests
would
be
the
only
trees
seen
then
beyond
this
parallel
of
latitude
comes
the
limit
oh
i
know
what
a
of
latitude
is
because
i
learned
it
in
my
geography
said
dodo
who
had
been
pouting
since
nat
teased
her
about
the
cracked
ice
it
a
line
that
runs
all
round
the
world
like
the
equator
but
what
is
a
limit
do
you
remember
little
girl
answered
the
doctor
what
i
told
you
about
the
on
a
mountain
the
height
beyond
which
no
trees
grow
because
it
gets
too
cold
for
them
up
there
it
is
just
the
same
if
you
go
northward
on
flat
ground
like
orchard
farm
for
when
you
have
gone
far
enough
there
are
no
more
trees
to
be
seen
in
that
northern
country
the
winter
is
so
long
and
cold
and
summer
is
so
short
that
only
scrubby
bushes
can
grow
there
next
beyond
these
we
should
find
merely
the
rough
curling
grass
of
the
barren
grounds
which
would
tell
us
we
were
approaching
the
arctic
circle
and
already
near
the
place
where
wise
men
think
it
is
best
to
turn
homeward
for
it
is
close
to
the
land
of
the
polar
bear
and
the
northern
lights
the
region
of
perpetual
snow
but
dreary
as
this
would
seem
to
us
nest
building
is
going
on
there
this
june
day
as
well
as
here
running
lightly
over
uneven
hummocks
of
grass
are
plump
birds
with
soft
musical
voices
and
the
gentlest
possible
manners
they
may
have
already
brought
out
one
brood
in
thick
deep
grassy
nests
well
lined
with
rabbit
fur
or
snow
owl
feathers
that
they
know
so
well
how
to
tuck
under
a
protecting
ledge
of
rock
or
bunch
of
grass
now
and
then
a
male
snowflake
will
take
a
little
flight
and
sing
as
merrily
as
his
cousin
the
goldfinch
but
he
never
stays
long
away
from
the
ground
where
seeds
are
to
be
found
the
white
feathers
of
these
birds
are
as
soft
as
their
friend
the
snow
of
which
they
seem
a
part
they
have
more
white
about
them
than
any
other
color
and
this
snowy
plumage
marks
them
distinctly
from
all
their
sparrow
cousins
after
the
moult
when
a
warm
brown
hue
veils
the
white
feathers
and
the
short
northern
summer
has
ended
the
birds
flock
together
for
their
travels
when
they
will
visit
us
no
one
can
say
they
come
and
go
as
if
driven
by
the
wind
a
soft
clinging
december
snowstorm
begins
and
suddenly
you
will
wonder
at
a
cloud
of
brown
leaves
that
settle
on
a
bare
spot
in
the
road
then
whirl
up
and
clearing
the
high
fence
drop
into
the
shelter
of
the
barnyard
very
strange
you
will
say
leaves
act
as
if
they
were
bewitched
you
look
again
and
rub
your
eyes
for
these
same
whirling
winter
leaves
are
now
walking
about
the
yard
picking
up
and
grain
under
the
very
nose
of
the
cross
old
rooster
himself
then
you
discover
that
they
are
not
leaves
at
all
but
plump
little
birds
who
if
they
could
speak
would
say
how
very
much
obliged
they
are
for
the
food
when
the
snow
melts
they
fly
away
by
the
time
they
have
got
home
again
weather
and
travel
have
worn
the
brown
edges
of
their
feathers
away
so
that
the
black
parts
show
and
thus
without
a
second
moulting
they
are
birds
again
when
you
search
for
them
look
in
the
air
or
on
the
or
about
the
haystack
or
on
the
ground
for
they
seldom
perch
in
trees
why
is
that
asked
rap
i
should
think
it
would
be
warmer
for
them
in
the
thick
evergreens
they
nest
on
the
ground
and
as
they
also
gather
their
food
there
are
unused
to
large
trees
why
do
they
nest
in
trees
up
north
asked
nat
for
the
same
reason
laughed
olive
that
simple
simon
did
catch
a
whale
in
the
water
pail
there
are
no
trees
where
the
snowflake
nests
the

the

the

finch
please
uncle
before
you
tell
us
about
this
sparrow
will
you
look
at
a
sort
of
a
striped
bird
that
has
been
fidgeting
over
there
under
the
bushes
ever
since
we
have
been
here
illustration
vesper
sparrow
i
have
been
watching
him
too
said
rap
a
minute
ago
when
he
flew
over
the
stone
fence
i
saw
he
had
white
feathers
outside
on
his
tail
now
he
is
back
again
how
very
kind
that
bird
is
to
come
when
he
is
wanted
and
save
my
time
it
is
the
vesper
sparrow
himself
i
suspect
that
we
are
nearer
to
his
nest
than
he
cares
to
have
us
he
is
so
uneasy
where
would
the
nest
most
likely
be
asked
nat
in
a
tree
or
a
bush
most
sparrow
nests
are
near
the
ground
said
rap
a
little
lower
yet
rap
the
vesper
sparrow
sinks
his
deep
nest
either
in
thick
grass
or
in
the
ground
itself
but
though
it
is
thus
supported
on
all
sides
it
is
as
nicely
woven
as
if
it
were
a
tree
nest
it
is
a
very
pretty
bird
said
dodo
does
it
sing
well
why
is
it
called
the
vesper
sparrow
what
does
vesper
mean
uncle
roy
vesper
means
evening
this
plainly
clothed
little
bird
has
a
beautiful
voice
and
sings
in
the
morning
chorus
with
his
brothers
but
he
is
fond
of
continuing
his
song
late
into
the
twilight
after
most
others
have
gone
to
bed
then
in
the
stillness
his
voice
sounds
sweet
and
clear
and
the
words
of
the
song
are
chewee
chewee
lira
lira
lira
lee
that
is
the
way
he
says
his
evening
prayers
you
know
that
in
some
of
the
churches
there
is
a
beautiful
service
called
vespers
ah
if
we
only
knew
bird
language
do
you
remember
said
olive
last
night
when
you
were
going
to
bed
you
asked
me
if
it
was
a
very
rare
bird
that
was
singing
so
late
down
in
the
garden
and
i
told
you
that
it
was
a
sparrow
it
was
the
vesper
bird
perhaps
the
very
one
who
is
over
there
in
the
bushes
wondering
if
the
giant
house
people
will
find
his
nest
you
can
easily
tell
him
when
he
flits
in
front
of
you
by
the
roadside
because
he
always
shows
two
white
feathers
one
on
each
side
of
his
tail
the
vesper
sparrow
length
six
inches
upper
parts
brown
streaked
with
dusty
some
bright
bay
on
the
wings
but
no
yellow
anywhere
and
two
white
under
parts
striped
on
breast
and
sides
with
brown
a
citizen
of
north
america
from
canada
southward
nesting
north
of
the
middle
states
a
regular
member
of
the
guild
of
weed
warriors
and
in
summer
belonging
also
to
the
seed
sowers
and
ground
gleaners
sparrow
the
peabody
bird
the
is
another
bird
that
you
will
not
see
in
his
summer
home
unless
you
look
for
him
in
the
northern
states
you
may
find
him
nesting
about
the
white
mountains
on
or
near
the
ground
with
the
thrush
and
winter
wren
in
other
places
he
may
be
seen
as
a
visitor
any
time
in
spring
and
autumn
or
may
even
linger
about
the
whole
winter
you
remember
the
dead
one
nat
found
that
we
used
when
i
was
teaching
you
something
about
birds
in
general
that
rainy
day
before
i
began
to
tell
you
the
particular
bird
stories
if
you
think
of
sparrows
only
as
a
sober
family
you
may
be
surprised
to
learn
that
this
large
handsome
bird
with
the
white
throat
the
head
striped
with
black
and
white
a
yellow
spot
over
the
eye
and
richly
variegated
brown
feathers
is
a
member
of
that
group
it
bothered
me
dreadfully
at
first
said
rap
until
one
fall
some
sportsmen
who
came
through
the
upper
fields
looking
for
quail
whistled
his
song
and
told
me
about
him
there
were
lots
of
them
here
early
this
spring
by
the
mill
but
the
miller
did
like
them
because
they
pitched
into
his
pasture
and
gobbled
the
yes
of
course
they
eat
in
spring
when
the
old
weed
seeds
of
autumn
are
well
scattered
but
surely
we
must
give
a
citizen
bird
some
good
valuable
food
not
treating
him
like
a
pauper
whom
we
expect
to
live
always
on
refuse
some
morning
in
early
spring
when
the
chickadees
who
have
wintered
about
the
farm
are
growing
restless
and
about
ready
to
go
to
a
more
secluded
spot
to
nest
you
will
hear
a
sweet
persuasive
whistling
song
coming
from
a
clump
of
bushes
what
is
it
not
a
bluebird
or
a
robin
the
notes
are
too
short
and
simple
for
a
song
sparrow
or
a
thrush
too
plaintive
for
a
wren
and
too
clear
for
a
lisping
wood
warbler
illustration
sparrow
presently
several
fly
down
to
a
bit
of
newly
seeded
lawn
or
patch
of
wild
grass
where
they
feed
industriously
for
a
few
minutes
giving
only
a
few
little
by
way
of
conversation
then
one
flies
up
into
a
bush
and
sings
in
a
high
key
what
does
he
say
for
the
song
of
two
short
bars
surely
has
words
one
person
understands
it
one
way
and
thinks
the
bird
says

nat
who
was

provoked
at
her
success
nothing
at
all
said
olive
when
they
only
whistle
whistled
to
birds
ever
since
i
could
pucker
up
my
lips
and
father
taught
me
how
did
you
father
dear
only
you
used
to
say
whistle
in
public
places
i
believe
i
did
and
rap
shall
teach
you
dodo
so
you
can
call
a
bird
close
to
you
by
imitating
its
song

i
know
a
chippy
now
when
i
see
it
before
you
tell
us
anything
about
it
said
dodo
gleefully
there
were
three
or
four
dear
little
ones
yesterday
on
the
grass
near
the
window
they
had
velvety
brown
caps
on
and
said
chip
chip
as
they
hopped
along
and
as
they
did
seem
afraid
of
me
i
threw
out
some
and
they
picked
them
up
then
i
knew
to
begin
with
that
they
must
be
birds
how
did
you
know
that
asked
nat
are
seeds
illustration
chipping
sparrow
no
but
bread
is
made
of
do
you
remember
olive
said
so
last
week
when
she
told
us
about
all
the
grains
yes
said
nat
reluctantly
birds
that
wo
eat
seeds
wo
eat
either
continued
dodo
earnestly
i
tried
wood
thrushes
with
last
week
and
they
simply
turned
up
their
noses
at
them
rap
and
nat
laughed
at
the
idea
of
birds
turning
up
their
noses
but
the
doctor
said
very
good
indeed
miss
dodo
you
are
learning
to
use
your
eyes
and
your
reason
at
the
same
time
tell
us
some
more
about
your
chippies
at
first
i
did
know
what
they
were
and
then
they
seemed
like
some
kind
of
sparrows
so
i
went
to
the
wonder
room
and
looked
at
some
of
the
books
that
you
left
out
on
the
low
shelf
for
us
i
could
find
any
picture
that
matched
but
then
i
began
to
read
about
sparrows
and
when
i
came
to
chippy
sparrow
i
was
sure
it
matched
for
the
book
said
it
was
a
clever
little
fellow
with
a
jaunty
red
cap
that
came
with
his
mate
to
the
very
door
and
that
children
make
the
chippy
acquaintance
and
hunt
in
the
vines
on
the
piazza
or
in
a
bush
for
its
nest
and
that
the
nest
is
very
neat
and
made
of
horsehair
here
dodo
stopped
to
get
her
breath
bravo
bravo
called
the
doctor
i
see
that
i
shall
soon
have
to
resign
my
place
as
bird
man
if
this
young
lady
takes
to
bird
hunting
and
reading
also
is
there
more
to
come
little
one
yes
uncle
roy
just
a
little
bit
more
because
the
book
said
children
looked
for
chippies
nests
i
went
right
away
to
see
if
i
could
find
one
first
i
hunted
in
all
the
bushes
and
the
catbirds
scolded
me
and
the
brown
thrasher
in
the
barberry
bush
was
very
mad
and
a
robin
in
the
low
crotch
of
the
tree
nearly
tipped
his
nest
over
he
flew
away
in
such
a
hurry
i
thought
i
had
better
stop
but
by
this
time
i
was
way
down
in
the
garden
and
all
at
once
i
saw
a
chippy
fly
straight
into
the
big
rose
bush
at
the
beginning
of
our
arbor
i
looked
in
and
there
about
as
high
up
as
my
chin
was
the
loveliest
little
nest
like
a
nice
grass
cup
with
pretty
rosebuds
all
around
it
for
a
trimming
and
on
it
sat
a
chippy
and
do
you
know
it
never
flew
away
when
i
stroked
its
back
with
my
finger
it
was
so
cute
and
friendly
i
thought
i
would
give
it
a
little
mite
of
a
kiss
on
top
of
its
head
but
i
guess
it
misunderstood
and
thought
i
meant
to
bite
for
it
flew
off
a
little
way
and
i
saw
three
speckled
blue
eggs
and
then
i
thought
i
better
come
away
did
you
hear
it
sing
asked
nat
no
it
only
said
chippy
chip
chippies
have
two
songs
said
the
doctor
one
is
a
kind
of
chirp
or
trill
like
an
insect
note
they
give
this
usually
when
they
first
wake
up
in
the
morning
the
other
is
a
pretty
little
melody
but
is
less
frequently
heard
if
they
eat
seed
why
do
they
stay
here
all
winter
asked
rap
yet
i
sure
they
do
they
are
not
as
hardy
as
some
of
their
brothers
and
do
not
like
our
winter
weather
but
even
in
autumn
you
may
mistake
them
for
some
other
sparrow

junco
when
i
was
a
boy
here
at
the
farm
these
juncos
were
my
winter
pets
a
flock
was
always
sure
to
come
in
october
and
stay
until
the
last
of
april
or
even
into
may
if
the
season
was
cold
one
winter
when
the
snow
came
at
thanksgiving
and
did
not
leave
the
ground
until
march
the
birds
had
a
hard
time
of
it
i
can
tell
you
the
robins
and
bluebirds
soon
grew
discouraged
and
left
one
by
one
the
chickadees
retreated
to
the
shelter
of
some
hemlock
woods
and
i
thought
the
winter
wrens
were
frozen
into
the
woodpile
for
i
did
not
see
any
for
weeks
the
only
cannibal
birds
that
seemed
to
be
about
were
a
pair
of
cat
owls
that
spent
most
of
the
time
in
our
where
they
paid
for
their
lodgings
by
catching
rats
and
mice
but
my
flock
of
juncos
were
determined
to
brave
all
weathers
first
they
ate
the
seeds
of
all
the
weeds
and
tall
grasses
that
reached
above
the
snow
then
they
cleaned
the
honeysuckles
of
their
watery
black
berries
when
these
were
nearly
gone
i
began
to
feed
them
every
day
with
crumbs
and
they
soon
grew
very
tame
at
christmas
an
ice
storm
came
and
after
that
the
cold
was
bitter
indeed
for
two
days
i
did
not
see
my
birds
but
on
the
third
day
in
the
afternoon
when
i
was
feeding
the
hens
in
the
barnyard
a
party
of
feeble
juncos
hardly
able
to
fly
settled
down
around
me
and
began
to
pick
at
the
chicken
food
i
knew
at
a
glance
that
after
a
few
hours
more
exposure
all
the
poor
little
birds
would
be
dead
so
i
shut
up
the
hens
and
opened
the
door
of
the
very
wide
scattered
a
quantity
of
meal
and
cracked
corn
in
a
line
on
the
floor
and
crept
behind
the
door
to
watch
first
one
bird
hopped
in
and
tasted
the
food
he
found
it
very
good
and
evidently
called
his
brothers
for
in
a
minute
they
all
went
in
and
i
closed
the
door
upon
them
and
i
slept
better
that
night
because
i
knew
that
my
birds
were
comfortable
may
go
in
once
but
you
will
never
catch
them
so
again
said
my
father
when
he
heard
about
it
i
had
an
idea
however
that
the
birds
trusted
me
for
though
they
flew
out
very
gladly
the
next
morning
they
did
not
seem
afraid
sure
enough
in
the
afternoon
they
came
back
again
i
kept
them
at
night
in
this
way
for
several
weeks
and
one
afternoon
several
snowflakes
came
in
with
them
later
on
this
same
winter
five
thin
starving
quails
came
to
the
barnyard
and
fed
with
the
hens
i
tried
several
times
to
lure
or
drive
them
into
the
barn
with
the
juncos
but
they
would
not
go
finally
one
evening
when
i
shut
the
chickens
up
what
did
these
quails
do
but
run
into
the
with
the
others
and
remain
as
the
guests
of
our
cochins
until
spring
i
well
remember
how
happy
i
was
when
grandmother
gave
me
half
a
dollar
and
told
me
to
go
over
to
the
mill
and
buy
a
bag
of
grain
sweepings
for
my
how
angry
i
was
with
the
miller
when
he
said
quails
be
good
eatin
when
they
fat
and
how
he
laughed
when
i
shouted

have

songs

ways

are

is

probably
have

as
before
not
shedding
his

temper

his

now
there
are
a

many
birds

you
will
see
that
wear

and
sing
wonderful
songs
in

and
early
summer
while
the

is
warm

sings

is

about

location
of
his
nest

putting
it
on
or
near
the
ground

of
course
some
pairs
may
have
ideas
of
their
own
about
and
choose
a
or
even
a
hole
in
a
tree
one
thing
you
must
remember
about
birds
and
their
ways
nature
has
fixed
a
few
important
laws
that
must
not
be
changed
but
has
given

wherever
the
thick
nest
is
placed
it
is
cleverly
hidden
if
in
a
low

it
is
in
the

where
the

above
the

if
on

our
sparrow
likes
to
live
in
the
garden
hedges
and
about
the
orchard
and
to
cultivate
the
acquaintance
of
house
people
in
a
shy
sort
of
way
he
never
flies
directly
to
and
from
his
home
like
the
chippy
wren
and
robin
but
slips
off
the
nest
and
runs
along
the
ground
as
nimbly
as
a
thrush
till
he
reaches
a
bush
well
away
from
his
house
when
he
hops
into
it
and
flies
away
chek
chek
is
the
of
the
song
sparrows
who
also
have
a
short
sweet
song
which
every
bird
varies
and
lengthens
to
please
himself
or
his
mate
maids
maids
hang
on
your
some
people
fancy
the
bird
says
and
the
short
song
fits
these
words
very
well
but
when
this
sparrow
sings
his
best
music
all
trembling
with
love
and
joy
he
forgets
about
such
a
simple
thing
as
the
now
it
is
a
grand
banquet
he
tells
you
of
with
flowers
and
music
then
he
stops
suddenly
remembering
that
he
is
only
a
little
brown
bird
and
sings
to
his
favorite
alder
bush
by
the
brook
a
soft
apology
for
having
forgotten
himself
this
sparrow
even
dreams
music
in
the
spring
when
you
will
often
hear
his
notes
in
the
darkest
hours
of
the
night
the
eggs
are
as
varied
as
the
songs
being
light
blue
or
whitish
with
every
imaginable
sort
of
brown
marking
no
two
sets
are
exactly
alike
birds
eggs
often
vary
in
color
like
their
plumage
and
the
different
hues
seem
fitted
to
hide
the
eggs
for
those
of
birds
that
nest
in
holes
and
need
no
concealing
are
usually
plain
white
if
you
ever
make
a
bird
calendar
at
orchard
farm
you
may
be
able
to
write
this
sparrow
name
in
every
month
of
the
year
another
good
thing
about
this
happy
faithful
bird
is
that
his
tribe
increases
in
birdland
in
spite
of
all
dangers

here
we
have
one
of
the
larger
birds
of
the
finch
family
who
is
both
nervous
and
shy
and
so
quick
to
slip
out
of
sight
that
he
always
surprises
one
to
see
the
towhee
as
he
hops
away
from
the
briers
that
hide
his
nest
you
would
never
dream
that
he
is
a
cousin
to
the
meek
brown
sparrows
a
very
smart
bird
is
as
he
keeps
telling
you
his
name
is

in
his
glossy
black

his

with
reddish

a

has
he
in

that
sparkle

inside
that
little
head
are
very
wise
thoughts
how
are
his

asked

are
they
all
plain
red

only
red
in
a

around
the

mine
are

they
are
in

as
you
say
we
call
this
ring
the

the

the
please
what
does
iris
mean
iris
is
the
name
of
one
of
the
lily
flowers
that
grow
in
the
garden
iris
is
a
word
that
means
rainbow
which
as
you
know
is
a
belt
of
beautiful
colors
made
by
the
sun
shining
through
rain
the
iris
of
the
eye
is
a
film
of
color
covering
the
watery
inside
part
of
the
eyeball
and
the
pupil
is
a
round
hole
in
the
iris
that
lets
the
light
into
the
back
of
the
eye
this
opening
expands
and
contracts
according
to
whether
the
eye
needs
much
or
little
light
i
tell
you
this
now
but
you
will
need
to
remember
it
when
we
come
to
the
owls
who
have
curious
ways
of
keeping
too
much
light
from
their
eyes
the
iris
in
birds
as
in
house
people
may
be
of
many
different
colors
red
as
in
the
vireo
i
told
you
about
and
as
you
now
know
it
is
with
the
towhee
each
has
a
brother
with
white
eyes
you
remember
the
vireo
and
in
florida
there
is
a
towhee
who
has
white
eyes
but
this
is
so
unusual
that
it
makes
the
bird
look
to
you
as
if
it
were
blind
until
you
understand
that
it
is
the
natural
color
most
eyes
are
brown
of
some
shade
or
perfectly
black
a
few
have
blue
or
green
eyes
but
where
did
i
leave
you
were
saying
that
he
is
wise
answered
rap
well
he
is
wise
enough
never
to
fly
either
straight
to
or
from
his
nest
which
is
a
rather
poor
affair
down
on
the
ground
within
reach
of
every
weasel
or
snake
that
cares
to
rob
it
he
does
not
sing
on
the
ground
but
moves
silently
among
the
leaves
and
litter
of
old
ferns
such
as
are
found
near
ponds
and
streams
a
stick
will
crackle
perhaps
and
thus
draw
your
attention
to
him
when
he
knows
that
he
is
seen
he
will
flip
his
wings
and
flirt
his
tail
like
suddenly
opening
and
shutting
a
fan
as
he
flits
on
before
you
with
his
head
on
one
side
giving
the
pert
call
towhee
that
is
one
of
his
names
some
people
think
he
says
chewink
and
call
him
by
that
name
while
some
who
have
noticed
where
he
lives
and
seen
that
the
color
of
his
sides
is
like
the
reddish
breast
of
the
robin
call
him
the
ground
robin
though
he
is
no
relation
of
the
thrush
family
meanwhile
his
wife
stays
quietly
on
the
nest
where
her
brown
back
matches
the
dead
leaves
of
which
it
is
made
outside
keeping
her
quite
safe
from
sight
in
the
afternoon
when
the
work
of
the
day
is
almost
over
and
her
mate
is
tired
of
scratching
about
for
food
he
takes
a
little
rest
and
goes
up
high
in
a
tree
to
boldly
declare
his
whereabouts
he
calls
defiantly
as
if
he
did
not
like
having
to
keep
quiet
all
day
and
meant
to
tell
his
name
at
last
in
early
autumn
the
joree
family
grow
sociable
enough
to
come
into

they
seldom

warrior
the

the

there
is
a
legend
about
this
cardinal
the
soldier
with
a
red
uniform
said
the
doctor
one
of
mammy
bun
strange
stories
that
came
from
the
indians
to
the
negroes
always
growing
larger
and
stranger
there
were
two
indian
warriors
of
the
southwest
that
hated
each
other
one
had
an
only
daughter
and
the
other
a
son
while
their
fathers
were
at
war
this
boy
and
girl
met
in
the
green
forest
the
old
women
of
their
tribes
told
them
that
they
must
never
speak
to
each
other
or
their
fathers
would
surely
kill
them
but
the
children
said
is
no
war
or
hate
in
our
forest
the
birds
meet
why
may
not
we
one
summer
evening
they
stayed
too
long
watching
the
fish
swim
in
the
river
and
floating
little
sticks
for
canoes
the
two
warriors
returned
suddenly
to
their
villages
missed
their
children
and
then
some
one
told
them
tales
illustration
cardinal
the
wind
whispered
to
the
trees
trouble
these
warriors
hate
each
other
more
than
they
love
their
children
hide
them
o
trees
then
the
trees
whispered
to
the
birds
the
poor
children
help
help
and
the
birds
said
shall
be
turned
into
birds
and
escape
if
you
will
make
a
little
fire
o
wind
to
delay
the
warriors
and
give
us
time
so
the
trees
told
the
fireflies
to
light
the
dead
leaves
that
covered
the
ground
the
wind
breathed
on
the
fire
and
soon
the
wood
was
all
aflame
birds
do
you
choose
to
be
that
you
may
always
live
in
the
forest
together
asked
the
bird
brothers
of
the
children
quickly
for
the
time
is
short
will
be
a
large
brown
sparrow
said
the
girl
none
will
trap
me
for
my
feathers
i
too
said
the
boy
suddenly
they
were
no
longer
children
but
there
was
confusion
as
the
fire
burned
nearer
and
nearer
fly
cried
the
bird
brothers
have
wings
do
not
look
at
the
earth
lest
you
grieve
to
leave
it
gonda
being
obedient
made
an
effort
to
fly
above
the
flame
which
only
tinged
some
of
her
feathers
red
but
towai
loath
to
leave
the
earth
lingered
so
long
that
his
feathers
became
all
red
from
the
flames
and
the
soot
blackened
his
face
though
these
two
birds
and
their
children
still
belong
to
the
sparrow
family
they
have
little
peace
in
the
forest
where
they
live
towai
wears
a
splendid
red
robe
and
is
called
the
cardinal
but
there
is
a
price
upon
his
head
because
of
his
beauty
this
is
one
of
the
legends
that
explains
why
this
bird
is
classed
with
sparrows
the
tanager
is
more
fiery
red
and
the
oriole
carries
flame
on
his
back
but
there
is
something
strange
about
the
cardinal
he
seems
out
of
place
and
lonely
with
us
he
should
belong
to
a
tropical
country
and
have
orchids
and
palms
for
companions
but
instead
where
do
we
find
him
please
doctor
said
rap
who
thought
he
could
answer
that
question
the
miller
wife
has
a
pair
in
a
cage
but
they
are
very
pretty
they
scraped
most
of
the
feathers
off
their
heads
and
rumpled
their
tails
trying
to
get
out
the
miller
caught
three
of
them
down
there
last
winter
only
one
died
and
the
other
two
are
a
bit
happy
the
male
does
sing
and
the
female
has
a
cough
the
miller
wife
does
care
much
for
them
they
a
bother
to
feed
she
says
have
to
have
and
rice
with
the
hulls
on
and
all
that
why
does
she
let
them
out
asked
olive
she
thinks
that
maybe
some
of
the
people
that
come
fishing
will
buy
them
how
much
does
she
ask
for
them
said
the
doctor
she
said
if
they
ever
moulted
out
and
got
any
decent
feathers
she
could
ask
three
dollars
for
them
but
the
way
they
were
looking
a
dollar
was
all
she
could
expect
children
shall
we
have
a
liberty
festival
this
morning
how
would
you
like
for
me
to
buy
these
birds
and
bring
them
here
so
that
you
can
see
them
then
then
what
open
the
cage
and
let
them
out
and
see
what
they
will
do
screamed
dodo
jumping
up
and
down
may
i
go
down
to
buy
them
begged
nat
you
will
have
to
take
me
too
said
olive
can
i
open
the
door
asked
dodo
here
is
the
dollar
now
go
all
together
said
the
doctor
putting
his
hands
over
his
ears
but
if
you
make
so
much
noise
the
birds
in
the
river
woods
will
mistake
your
kind
intentions
and
think
you
are
a
family
of
wildcats
in
less
than
half
an
hour
the
party
returned
nat
carrying
the
cage
which
was
only
a
box
with
a
bit
of
wire
netting
over
the
front
no
wonder
poor
cardinal
has
a
cough
living
in
this
dirty
box
said
olive
see
father
only
one
perch
and
i
do
believe
the
poor
things
have
ever
had
a
bath
given
them
that
is
the
saddest
part
of
caging
wild
birds
said
the
doctor
not
one
person
in
fifty
is
willing
to
give
them
the
care
they
need
put
the
cage
under
those
bushes
nat
i
began
by
asking
where
do
we
find
this
bird
living
in
florida
in
sunshine
among
the
shady
redwoods
of
kentucky
and
in
all
the
bitterness
of
our
northern
winters
he
varies
his
habits
to
suit
his
surroundings
and
roves
about
after
the
nesting
season
in
mild
climates
he
sings
for
six
months
of
the
year
from
march
until
august
but
one
of
the
strangest
things
about
him
is
that
he
wanders
most
when
the
trees
are
bare
and
he
can
be
so
easily
seen
that
hundreds
of
his
kind
are
shot
for
their
gay
feathers
or
trapped
to
sell
alive
for
cage
birds
when
snow
is
on
the
ground
he
is
very
conspicuous
why
does
he
get
into
evergreens
or
cedar
bushes
asked
rap
he
does
when
he
can
and
often
sings
when
so
hidden
but
he
is
not
a
very
bird
and
seems
to
move
awkwardly
as
if
his
topknot
were
as
heavy
as
a
drum
major
bearskin
but
no
one
can
find
fault
with
his
song
it
first
rings
out
loud
like
a
shout
then
ends
as
clearly
as
the
bubbling
of
the
stream
near
which
he
likes
best
to
live
is
it
time
to
let
them
out
whispered
dodo
cardinal
is
coughing
again
dreadfully
in
a
moment
turn
the
cage
sideways
nat
so
that
we
can
watch
them
through
the
bushes
so
and
please
keep
quite
still
now
dodo
open
the
little
door
carefully
for
two
or
three
minutes
there
was
perfect
silence
four
young
people
squeezed
behind
a
tree
and
a
wise
man
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
behind
a
stump
all
watching
two
forlorn
birds
who
did
not
understand
that
liberty
was
theirs
for
the
taking
cardinal
put
out
her
head
then
took
a
step
and
hopped
along
the
ground
into
a
cornel
bush
where
after
looking
around
a
moment
she
began
to
smooth
her
poor
feather
another
minute
and
cardinal
followed
giving
a
sharp
chip
like
a
loud
sparrow
call
they
both
hopped
off
as
if
they
were
not
half
sure
their
freedom
was
real
i
think
they
might
have
sung
to
us
whispered
dodo
too
soon
said
the
doctor
but
i
sure
that
we
have
not
seen
or
heard
the
last
of
our
cardinals
hist
said
nat
they
are
taking
a
bath
in
the
brook
this
side
of
the
and
so
they
were
the
cardinal
length
eight
and
a
quarter
inches
male
splendid
with
a
black
throat
and
band
about
the
bill
and
a
fine
long
crest
like
a
cedar
waxwing
female
with
a
little
red
in
her
crest
wings
and
tail
and
her
face
not
so
black
as
her
mate
a
citizen
of
the
eastern
united
states
to
the
plains
and
from
florida
to
the
great
lakes
nesting
wherever
found
a

trapper
ground
gleaner
seed
sower
and

warrior
besides
being
a
fine
singer
the
grosbeak
the
bird
this
must
be
the
bird
i
saw
the
other
day
in
the
brush
lot
by
the
old
barn
said
rap
and
there
were
two
more
this
morning
in
our
own
potato
patch
why
do
they
go
there
doctor
because
this
bird
besides
wearing
a
beautiful
rosy
shield
on
his
breast
and
singing
at
morning
and
evening
more
beautifully
even
than
the
very
best
robin
is
a
very

his
living

farmers

their
fields
of
if
you
go
quietly
over
to
the
large
potato
lot
on
the
north
side
of
the
farm
you
will
find
these
birds
at
work
any
morning
i
saw
them
myself
and
am
going
to
trust
my
crop
entirely
to
their
keeping
this
season
they
are
nesting
in
the
young
growth
near
these
very
river
woods
and
i
will
show
you
one
of
their
homes
presently
you
see
that
protecting
birds
and
leaving
suitable
bits
of
woodland
and
brush
for
them
to
build
in
is
practical
as
well
as
sentimental

grosbeak
this
grosbeak
dares
not
trust
its
brilliant
colors
in
large
trees
or
open
places
and
so
nests
where
it
may
hide
in
a
maze
of
bushes
when
it
finds
the
right
spot
it
is
not
very
particular
about
a
jumble
of
weeds
twigs
roots
and
sometimes
rags
or
bits
of
paper
serves
to
hold
its
eggs
with
brown
markings
if
it
be
ever
right
to
cage
a
wild
bird
you
may
make
a
prisoner
of
this
grosbeak
but
remember
you
must
take
a
young
male
before
it
has
known
the
joys
of
freedom
and
give
at
least
a
every
day
to
taking
care
of
him
then
he
will
grow
to
love
you
and
be
a
charming
pet
living
happily
and
singing
gladly
but
under
any
other
circumstances
it
is
less
cruel
to
shoot
one
than
to
make
it
a
prisoner

on

the
indigo
bird
the
blue
canary
blue
birds
and
blue
flowers
are
both
rare
you
can
count
our
really
blue
birds
on
the
fingers
of
one
hand
and
a
blue
canary
is
even
stranger
than
a
green
rose
or
a
black
tulip
the
indigo
bird
has
many
of
the
canary
gentle
ways
and
though
his
music
is
not
so
fine
or
varied
as
that
of
the
goldfinch

sparrow
he
sings
a
sweet
little
tune
to
his
brown
mate
on
her
nest
in

pasture
she
is
fortunate
in
having
a
dull
dress
for
if
she
were
as
splendidly
blue
as
her
husband
nesting
would
be
a
very
anxious
occupation

her
indeed
her
poor
mate
has
anything

an
easy
time
his
color
is
so
bright
that
everybody
can
see
him
at
a
glance
and
when
he
picks
up
in
the
streaming
sunlight
his
feathers
glisten
like
sapphires
we
saw
an
indigo
bird
yesterday
cried
nat
and
dodo
together
it
was
in
the
geraniums
by
the
window
eating
the
seed
i
tipped
out
of
my
canary
cage
when
i
cleaned
it
continued
dodo
mammy
bun
said
it
was
a
blue
canary
but
nat
said
it
could
be
and
i
forgot
to
ask
about
it
are
you
going
to
tell
us
about
many
more
birds
in
the
finch
family
uncle
roy
not
now
you
have
heard
about
those
that
will
be
most
likely
to
attract
your
attention
and
when
you
can
name
them
they
will
introduce
you
to
all
the
rest
of
their
relations

indigo
bird
it
is
a
great
family
said
rap
who
was
sitting
thinking
big
birds
and
little
plain
gray
and
brown
or
red
blue
and
yellow
some
like
warm
weather
and
some
want
it
cold
speaking
of
cold
i
wonder
what
became
of
the
ice
that
dodo
saw
mammy
bun
cracking
this
morning
asked
the
doctor
looking
at
olive
the
very
word
has
a
pleasant
sound
for
it
seems
to
me
to
be
growing
warmer
and
warmer
toot
toot
squeaked
a
tin
horn
across
the
field
from
the
direction
of
the
farmhouse
what
that
said
nat
jumping
up
it
the
dinner
horn
and
it
be
not
more
than
eleven
said
rap
looking
at
the
sun
after
the
fashion
of
those
who
spend
much
time
out
of
doors
i
know
what
the
horn
means
said
olive
it
means
that
the
cake
that
nat
said
mammy
bun
was
going
to
bake
with
the
ice
is
done
but
that
was
only
nonsense
you
know
said
nat
ice
wo
bake
anything
perhaps
not
but
ice
can
freeze
something
if
you
mix
salt
with
it
even
on
this
warm
day
and
the
horn
means
that
mammy
has
a
tin
pail
full
of
ice
cream
waiting
for
some
one
to
eat
it
ice
cream
made
with
fresh
strawberries
do
break
your
neck
nat
for
nat
had
dashed
off
so
quickly
that
it
was
no
use
for
dodo
and
rap
to
try
to
keep
up
with
him
why
do
you
mostly
have
something
nice
for
us
to
eat
on
asked
dodo
cuddling
into
the
bend
of
her
uncle
arm
for
two
reasons
girlie
when
i
was
a
boy
being
out
of
doors
made
me
so
hungry
that
it
always
seemed
a
long
time
between
breakfast
and
dinner
i
know
that
little
brains
remember
best
when
the
stomachs
that
nourish
them
are
not
empty
neither
bird
children
nor
house
children
should
go
too
long
hungry
it
is
as
bad
as
nibbling
all
day
i
noticed
since
i
came
here
i
have
needed
even
to
peep
in
the
cooky
box
between
times
are
you
one
of
the
seven
wise
men

dodo
hugging
him

answered
the
doctor
no
fortunately
i
am
not
for
they
are
all
dead
what
that
whispered
rap
pointing
toward
the
river
whence
a
strong
rapid
musical
song
came
ending
before
you
could
catch
the
syllables
and
then
being
repeated
two
or
three
times
it
is
the
cardinal
said
the
doctor
in
some
surprise
for
the
bird
was
singing
almost
at
noon
i
can
see
his
red
liberty
cap
near
the
top
of
the
tallest
hemlock
hoo
hoo
called
the

and
then
the

arrived

chapter
xvii
a
midsummer
excursion
it
was
that
wonderful
week
after
the
middle
of
june
the
week
that
holds
the
best
of
everything
the
longest
days
of
the
whole
year
the
biggest
strawberries
and
the
sweetest
roses
everything
at
its
height
birds
in
full
song
bees
in
the
flowers
children
in
hammocks
under
the
trees
and
a
wise
man
humming
happily
to
himself
as
he
breathed
it
all
in
i
do
think
that
anything
nicer
than
this
can
happen
said
nat
swinging
so
hard
in
his
hammock
that
he
rolled
out
into
the
long
grass
it
does
seem
as
if
it
answered
dodo
only
here
at
orchard
farm
there
is
so
much
niceness
you
never
can
tell
what
is
the
very
nicest
the
wise
man
laughed
to
himself
and
then
whistled
an
imitation
of
the
sparrow
call
at
which
sound
dodo
promptly
rolled
out
of
her
hammock
and
bumped
into
nat
who
was
still
lying
in
the
grass
then
both
the
children
sat
up
and
listened
all
day
whittling
whittling
whittling
whistled
the
notes
you
ought
to
be
further
north
building
your
nest
said
nat
do
you
know
that
mr
peabody
it
uncle
roy
cried
dodo
spying
him
back
of
the
perch
how
would
you
like
to
go
down
to
the
seashore
little
folks
there
exclaimed
dodo
you
see
there
is
more
niceness
yet
i
suppose
by
that
you
mean
laughed
the
doctor
olive
and
i
have
planned
to
take
the
surrey
with
a
hamper
of
good
things
to
eat
and
drive
down
to
the
sandy
shore
where
the
river
broadens
into
salt
water
there
is
a
house
on
the
bay
where
we
can
have
our
dinner
and
the
meadows
and
marshes
are
full
of
birds
do
quite
smother
me
dodo
then
in
the
cool
of
the
afternoon
we
can
return
and
have
a
picnic
supper
at
some
pretty
place
on
the
way
for
night
the
moon
is
full
can
rap
go
with
us
for
he
hardly
ever
gets
down
to
the
shore
certainly
how
far
is
it
asked
nat
about
fifteen
miles
by
the
road
though
not
more
than
ten
in
a
straight
line
are
the
birds
different
down
there
some
of
them
are
there
is
a
great
colony
of
blackbirds
i
want
you
to
see
for
our
next
family
is
a
very
interesting
one
it
contains
a
harlequin
a
tramp
a
soldier
a
a
and
a
and
we
shall
probably
see
them
all
sooner
or
later
but
certainly
one
or
two
of
them
no
i
wo
tell
you
a
word
about
them
now
but
go
down
and
invite
rap
and
tell
him
we
will
call
for
him
by
six
in
the
morning
because
we
must
have
time
to
drive
slowly
stop
where
we
please
and
use
our
eyes
early
next
morning
the
party
set
out
five
happy
children
the
youngest
eight
and
the
oldest
started
from
orchard
farm
behind
a
pair
of
comfortable
white
horses
that
never
wore
blinkers
or
these
big
members
of
the
party
were
human
enough
to
look
around
as
the
children
scrambled
into
the
surrey
and
then
prick
up
their
ears
as
if
they
knew
the
difference
between
a
picnic
and
a
plough
and
were
happy
accordingly
they
trotted
down
the
turnpike
a
mile
and
then
turned
into
a
bordered
by
almost
ready
for
cutting
olive
was
driving
for
she
loved
the
old
white
horses
rap
nat
and
dodo
sat
in
the
middle
seat
and
the
doctor
behind
please
doctor
what
is
the
name
of
the
bird
family
we
are
going
to
visit
asked
rap
the
family
of
the
blackbirds
and
orioles
but
it
has
a
latin
name
when
it
walks
in
the
procession
listen
listen
cried
dodo
oh
olive
do
stop
there
some
kind
of
a
bird
on
top
of
those
bars
that
is
singing
as
if
he
had
started
and
could
stop
and
i
sure
his
voice
will
fly
away
from
him
in
a
minute
olive
said
whoa
immediately
it
only
a
bobolink
said
rap
as
the
bird
spread
his
wings
and
soared
into
the
air
still
singing
leaving
a
little
stream
of
music
behind
him
as
a
dancing
canoe
leaves
a
train
of
ripples
in
the
water
it
is
a
bobolink
surely
said
the
doctor
and
not
a
bobolink
but
the
very
bird
we
should
be
most
glad
to
see
the
first
of
the
blackbird
and
oriole
family
the
harlequin
in
his
summer
livery
the
bobolink
the
reed
bird
the
rice
bird
illustration
bobolink
why
do
you
call
the
bobolink
a
uncle
roy
what
is
a
harlequin
asked
dodo
do
you
remember
that
harlequin
was
the
name
of
the
man
in
the
pantomime
we
saw
last
winter
who
wore
clothes
of
all
sorts
of
colors
changed
from
one
thing
to
another
and
was
always
dancing
about
as
if
he
could
not
possibly
keep
still
i
remember
said
dodo
but
i
do
think
he
was
a
bit
like
this
bobolink
for
that
harlequin
say
a
word
only
made
signs
and
the
bobolink
sings
faster
than
any
bird
i
ever
heard
before
yes
he
sings
now
but
it
is
only
for
a
short
time
next
month
he
will
be
dumb
and
before
you
know
it
his
beautiful
shining
black
coat
with
the
white
and
buff
trimmings
will
have
dropped
off
then
he
will
be
changed
to
dull
brown
like
his
wife
and
keep
as
quiet
as
poor
cinderella
sitting
in
the
ashes
do
you
see
any
birds
in
that
meadow
of
long
grass
asked
the
doctor
i
do
see
any
in
the
grass
said
rap
but
there
are
some
bobolinks
all
about
in
the
trees
along
the
edges
and
more
of
them
up
in
the
air
where
are
their
nests
doctor
i
never
found
a
bobolink
nest
their
nests
are
hidden
in
that
long
grass
and
their
mates
also
whoever
would
find
them
must
have
the
patience
of
an
indian
the
eyes
of
a
bird
and
the
cunning
of
a
fox
bobolink
finds
a
little
hollow
in
the
ground
where
the
roots
grow
and
rounds
up
a
nest
from
the
grass
stalks
with
finer
grass
tops
inside
then
she
so
arranges
the
weeds
and
stems
above
her
home
that
there
is
no
trace
of
a
break
in
the
meadow
and
when
she
leaves
the
nest
she
never
goes
boldly
out
by
the
front
door
or
bangs
it
behind
her
but
steals
off
through
a
in
the
grass
when
she
flies
out
of
shelter
at
last
she
has
already
run
a
good
way
off
so
that
instead
of
telling
the
watcher
where
her
home
is
she
tells
him
exactly
where
it
is
not
bob
earns
his
living
these
days
by
singing
and
going
to
market
for
the
family
but
he
does
both
in
a
tearing
hurry
for
his
housekeeping
like
his
honeymoon
is
short
he
must
lead
his
children
out
of
the
grass
before
the
mowers
overtake
him
or
the
summer
days
grow
short
for
then
he
will
have
to
spend
some
time
at
his
tailor
before
he
can
follow
the
warm
weather
down
south
again
twice
a
year
bob
has
to
make
the
most
complete
change
of
plumage
that
falls
to
the
lot
of
any
bird
his
summer
toilet
is
so
tiresome
and
discouraging
that
he
retires
into
the
thickest
reeds
to
make
it
out
he
comes
in
august
leaving
his
lovely
voice
behind
with
his
clothes
dressed
like
his
wife
with
hardly
a
word
to
say
for
himself
as
he
joins
the
flock
into
which
various
families
have
united
he
even
loses
his
name
and
is
called
reedbird
after
his
he
grows
reckless
and
says
to
his
brothers
do
we
care
if
we
ca
sing
any
more
we
can
eat
let
us
eat
and
be
merry
still
so
they
eat
all
they
can
and
wax
exceedingly
fat
the
gunners
know
this
and
come
after
them
meanwhile
in
southern
lowlands
the
that
have
been
hoed
and
flooded
with
water
all
the
season
to
make
the
grain
grow
are
covered
with
tall
stalks
of
rice
whose
grains
are
not
quite
ripe
but
soft
and
milky
like
green
corn
some
morning
there
is
a
great
commotion
on
the
plantation
ricebirds
have
come
is
the
cry
this
being
only
another
name
for
the
bobolink
out
fly
the
men
women
and
children
waving
sticks
blowing
horns
and
firing
off
guns
to
frighten
the
invaders
away
fires
are
lighted
by
night
to
scare
them
for
the
birds
travel
both
night
and
day
the
bobolinks
do
not
stop
for
all
this
noise
though
of
course
a
great
many
are
shot
ending
their
lives
inside
a
or
being
roasted
in
rows
of
six
on
a
skewer
but
the
rest
fly
on
when
they
are
ready
leaving
the
united
states
behind
them
and
go
through
florida
to
brazil
and
the
west

in
spring
on
the
northward
journey
the
suffer
again
the
males
are
jolly
minstrels
once
more
all
black
white
and
buff
hurrying
home
to
their
nesting
grounds
they
think
that
rice
newly
sown
and
sprouting
is
good
for
the
voice
and
stop
to
gobble
it
up
in
spite
of
all
objections
their
song
is
not
easy
to
express
in
words
from
which

this

george

baltimore
on

in

country
in
is
said
to
have
admired
the
colors
of
the
bird
and
adopted
them
for
his
coat
of
arms
some
called
him
because
he
is
so
flaming
orange
on
some
parts

others
from
the
way
he
slings
his
hammock
the
plainer
black

now
has

as
these
two
belong

family
we
may
as
well
have
them
now
though
in

regular
family
procession
the
walks
next
to
the
bobolink
who
is
such
a
vagrant
himself
this
oriole
takes
his
name
because
he
was
once
supposed
to
hang
his
nest
chiefly
in
the
branches
of
orchard
trees
but
he
is
as
likely
to
be
found
in
the
maples
by
the
garden
fence
as
anywhere
else
he
has
a
cheerful
rolling
song
as
varied
in
its
different
tunes
as
that
of
the

sparrow
it
is
not
like
a
robin
or
a
thrush
or
even
like
brother
baltimore
it
is
perfectly
original
and
before
these
birds
leave
the
orchard
you
must
listen
to
hear
it
for
yourselves
oriole
is
a
famous

from

of

credit

yet
she
has
only
a
beak
for
a
shuttle
or
whichever
you
please
to
call
it
i
think
it
is
most
like
the
needle
of
a

the
eye
at
the
point
so
that
it
pokes
the

rather

secures

at

likes

tireless
member
of

trappers

ground
gleaners
eating
hosts
of
caterpillars
wireworms
and
beetles
when
he
is
very
thirsty
he
does
now
and
then
take
a
sip
of
the
fruit
he
has
helped
to
save
and
once
in

may
eat
a

green
peas

would
any

refuse
a
mess
of

to

in

then
why
should
you
begrudge
a
few
to
neighbor
oriole
he
doubtless
paid
you
for
them
before
he
took
them
or
will
do
so
before
long
oriole
comes
north
before
his
mate
to
be
and
spends
a
few
days
in
fretting
until
she
arrives
then
he
sings
a
gladsome
song
to
tell
her
of
his
pleasure
and
she
answers
i
am
sorry
to
say
in
rather
a
complaining
tone
but
the
match
is
soon
made
though
they
are
not
the
birds
possible
they
are
as
quick
to
aid
as
to
quarrel
with
their
neighbors
their
bright
colors
seem
rather
out
of
place
in
the
family
which
contains
also
our
sombre
blackbirds
but
before
the
leaves
have
fallen
both
kinds
of
orioles
and
their
families
start
for
mexico
and
central
america
where
such
tropical
hues
seem
more
in
keeping
and
where
many
members
of
the
family
are
quite
as
brilliant
as
those
we
see
here
there
goes
another
oriole
cried
nat
what
a
beauty
too
i
suppose
he
has
a
nest
high
up
in
one
of
these
elms
over
the
road
very
likely
for
in
autumn
when
the
trees
are
bare
i
have
sometimes
counted
a
dozen
orioles
nests
in
this
very
row
of
elms
look
uncle
roy
look
over
in
that
pasture
what
are
all
those
black
and
brown
birds
walking
round
after
the
cows
just
as
chickens
do
said
dodo
those
are
members
of
the
blackbird
family
called
cowbirds
because
they
follow
the
cows
as
they
feed
in
order
to
pick
up
worms
and
bugs
that
are
shaken
out
of
the
grass
but
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
these
birds
are

a

cry
said

yes
but
not
more
disagreeable
than
the

habits
i
will
tell
you
what
happens
every
season
to
some
poor
warbler
sparrow
or
vireo
on
account
of
this
strange
bird
a
song
sparrow
builds
her
nest
in
the
grass
an
egg
is
laid
the
bird
looks
proudly
at
it
and
may
perhaps
fly
off
for
a
few
minutes
meanwhile
peeping
and
spying
along
comes
a
cowbird
she
wants
to
lay
an
egg
too
but
has
no
home
because
she
is
too
lazy
and
shiftless
to
build
one
she
sees
the
sparrow
nest
and
thinks
hah
that
bird
is
smaller
than
i
am
and
can
not
push
my
egg
out
i
will
leave
it
there
this
she
does
very
quickly
and
slips
away
again
illustration
cowbird
when
the
sparrow
comes
home
she
may
wonder
at
the
strange
egg
and
perhaps
be
able
to
push
it
out
of
the
nest
but
more
likely
she
takes
no
notice
of
it
as
it
is
so
much
like
her
own
and
lets
it
stay
if
she
does
this
that
egg
is
only
the
beginning
of
trouble
it
is
larger
than
her
own
so
it
gets
more
warmth
and
hatches
more
quickly
then
the
young
cowbird
grows
so
fast
that
it
squeezes
the
little
sparrows
dreadfully
sometimes
quite
out
of
the
nest
and
eats
so
much
that
they
are
half
or
wholly
starved
the
poor
sparrow
and
her
mate
must
sometimes
think
what
a
big
child
it
is
but
they
feed
it
kindly
until
it
can
fly
sometimes
even
after
it
leaves
the
nest
then
it
goes
back
to
join
the
flock
its
tramp
parents
belong
to
without
so
much
as
saying
you
to
its
foster
parents
a
cowbird
lays
only
one
egg
in
each
nest
but
sometimes
several
visit
the
same
nest
in
succession
and
then
the
poor
sparrow
has
a
hard
time
indeed
the
yellow
warbler
is
one
of
the
clever
birds
who
will
not
always
be
imposed
upon
you
remember
the
nest
we
found
and
some
of
the
larger
birds
push
out
the
strange
egg
but
cowbirds
are
very
crafty
and
usually
select
their
victims
from
among
the
small
feeble
and
helpless
does
this
hateful
cowbird
over
sing
asked
dodo
sometimes
in
spring
he
tries
to
he
squeaks
a
few
notes
and
makes
faces
struggling
choking
wheezing
as
if
he
had
swallowed
a
beetle
with
hooks
on
its
legs
and
was
in
great
pain
it
is
a
most
startling
noise
but
it
certainly
is
not
musical
though
perhaps
it
pleases
the
cowbird
ladies
for
if
they
have
such
bad
taste
in
other
ways
they
doubtless
like
such
harsh
and
inharmonious
sounds
i
do
see
what
makes
them
act
so
said
rap
i
thought
birds
had
to
build
nests
or
have
a
hole
or
a
bit
of
ground
or
rock
of
their
own
that
it
was
a
law
so
it
is
my
boy
but
the
cowbird
is
one
of
the
exceptions
i
told
you
about
and
i
am
glad
to
say
there
are
very
few
the
cowbird
length
about
seven
and
a
half
inches
male
very
glossy
black
excepting
the

on
again
the
road
crept
down
hill
passed
through

village
and
then
into
the
woods
once
more
the
children
saw
a
great
many
bird
friends
swallows
goldfinches
a
beautiful
blue
jay
which
was
new
to
them
and
some
yellow
warblers
they
stopped
for
half
an
hour
in
the
wooded
lane
where
a
chat
whistled
to
them
a
scarlet
tanager
flew
hastily
overhead
and
the
doctor
showed
them
a
towhee
rambling
among
the
leaves
while
a
little
brownish
bird
kept
flitting
into
the
air
and
back
to
his
perch
calling
pewee
in
a
sad
voice
what
that
asked
rap
it
a
bird
i
often
see
near
the
mill
catching
flies
on
the
wing
it
is
called
the
wood
pewee
said
the
doctor
when
we
come
back
this
afternoon
we
will
stop
and
i
will
try
to
find
its
nest
to
show
you
we
must
go
on
now
as
soon
as
they
drove
out
of
the
wood
the
smell
of
the
salt
marsh
came
to
them
and
they
saw
that
the
road
led
between
low
meadows
with
wooded
knolls
here
and
there
by
and
by
the
trees
grew
thinner
and
the
grass
coarser
oh
i
see
the
water
cried
dodo
and
the
little
house
where
we
are
going
oh
look
at
the
black
birds
flying
over
those
bushes
are
those
cowbirds
too
and
there
are
more
black
birds
very
big
ones
too
going
over
to
the
water
and
more
yet
coming
out
of
those
stumpy
little
pines
and
there
are
some
yellow
pigeons
down
in
the
grass
do
stop
quick
olive
i
think
there
is
going
to
be
a
bird
clambake
or
a
picnic
down
here
and
dodo
nearly
fell
out
of
the
surrey
in
her
excitement
not
exactly
a
picnic
said
the
doctor
but
what
i
have
brought
you
purposely
to
see
the
birds
flying
over
the
alders
are
blackbirds
those
coming
from
the
pines
are
purple
grackles
the
big
black
ones
flying
overhead
are
crows
and
the
fellows
walking
in
the
grass
are
meadowlarks
we
must
first
make
the
horses
comfortable
and
then
we
can
spend
the
day
with
the
birds
among
these
marshes
and
meadows
when
they
reached
the
beach
the
wagon
track
led
through
a
hedge
of
barberry
bushes
to
a
shed
covered
with
pine
boughs
at

the

himself
came
out
to

he
was

his
hut
stood
on
a
point
with
the
sandy
beach
of
the
bay
in
front
of
it
and
the
steeper
bank
where
the
river
ran
on
the
left
all
the
time
the
water
was
rushing
out
out
out
of
the
river
and
creeping
down
on
the
sand
to
make
low
tide
the
children
did
not
know
it
then
but
they
were
to
spend
many
happy
days
on
this
beach
in
company
with
their
uncle
and
olaf
during
the
next
two
years
the
doctor
whispered
something
mysterious
to
olaf
about
clams
hoes
and
dead
low
water
then
he
told
the
children
to
rest
awhile
under
the
pine
shelter
and
hear
about
the
blackbirds
before
they
went
out
to
see
them
in
the
meadows
the
blackbird
the
hussar
this
handsome
blackbird
comes
early
and
stays
late
in
places
where
he
does
not
linger
all
the
year
he
loves
wet
places
and
his
note
is
moist
and
juicy
to
match
his
nesting
haunts
he
calls
either
in
flying
or
as
he
walks
along
the
ground
after
the
fashion
of
his
brethren
for
blackbirds
never
hop
like
most
birds
with
both
feet
together
but
move
one
after
the
other
just
as
we
do
the
redwings
are
sociable
birds
nesting
in
small
colonies
and
when
once
settled
they
never
seem
to
stray
far
from
home
the
nest
is
a
thick
pocket
hung
either
between
reeds
over
the
water
or
fixed
to
the
upright
stems
of
a
bush
quite
near
the
ground
if
the
place
is
very
marshy
the
redwings
place
their
nests
where
it
would
seem
very
easy
to
reach
them
but
really
the
bushes
are
either
surrounded
by
a
little
creek
hidden
deep
in
the
reeds
or
the
ground
is
so
marshy
that
neither
man
nor
beast
can
come
near
that
is
the
one
reason
why
the
males
fly
about
so
boldly
showing
their
glossy
uniforms
with
the
red
and
gold
epaulets
when
we
try
to
visit
that
group
of
alders
where
the
colony
lives
you
will
see
for
yourselves
how
nicely
it
is
protected
we
welcome
this
blackbird
in
the
spring
because
his
is
one
of
the
earliest
in
autumn
when
he
leaves
the
marsh
and
brings
his
flock
to
the
we
do
not
like
him
quite
so
well
but
the
wise
men
say
that
even
then
he
is
a
good
fairy
in
disguise
eating
cutworms
and
other
injurious
kinds
even
when
stealing
a
bit
of
green
corn
they
think
he
clears
away
the
worms
that
bore
under
the
husks

may
be

it

depends
upon

of
the
two
lives
along

does
not
often
go

north
than

it
takes
its
name
from
its
habit
of
catching
fish
in
shallow
pools
and
bays
the
larger
crow
is
the
bird
that
every
one
knows
and
most
people
dislike
because
it
has
always
been
called
a
corn
thief
though
the
wise
men
say
it
is
rather
a
useful
bird
after
all
the
crow
is
certainly
a
black
bird
with
a
disagreeable
voice
if
several
pairs
make
up
their
minds
to
build
in
the
cedars
or
tall
pines
in
one
grounds
anywhere
near
the
house
the
noise
they
make
early
in
the
morning
is
very
tiresome
ka
they
call
and
quaver
at
the
first
peep
of
day
then
they
begin
to
look
about
for
breakfast
if
there
is
a
robin
or
dove
nest
at
hand
they
think
it
is
foolish
to
look
further
and
help
themselves
to
fresh
eggs
or
squabs
this
makes
us
very
angry
and
we
have

peck
or
two
of

bark

and

the
crafty
bird
had
hidden
it
illustration

it
is
perfectly
right
to
do
so
from

point
of
view
i
for
one
do
not
wish
crows
in
my
garden
or
about
the

where
i
see
only
the
bad
side
of
their
characters
so
we
chase
them
away
and
put
scarecrows
in

do
the
crows
care
not
a
bit
they
laugh
and
talk
about
us
behind
our
backs
and
before
our
faces
too
they
pretend
to
be
afraid
and
fly
away
if
a
man
appears
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
but
merely
to
settle
down
in
another
part
of
the
field
until
their
watcher
tells
them
to
move
away
again
there
is
a
watcher
for
every
flock
who
gives
the
order
to
fly
and
warns
the
troop
at
every
approach
of
danger
of
course
we
must
remember
that
for
many
months
of
the
year
the
crow
eats
grasshoppers
grubs
and
even
mice
but
it
is
easy
to
forget
this
when
one
discovers
that
half
a
dozen
crows
have
eaten
all
the
young
robins
in
the
orchard
in
a
single
morning
did
they
ever
do
that
in
our
orchard
asked
dodo
yes
not
once
but
many
times
and
that
is
the
reason
why
i
do
not
allow
crows
to
nest
anywhere
on
the
farm
in
great
open
farming
districts
where
other
birds
are
few

than
evil

the

is
a
queer
bird
who
can
twist
himself
into
all
sorts
of
shapes
he
sits
one
way
when
he
sings
another
when
he
is
watching
out
for
danger
and
when
he
calls
he
is
too
funny
for
anything
he
humps
himself
up
and
drops
his
tail
as
if
he
was
falling
apart

once
it
was
in

miller
woods
up
in
a
chestnut
tree
and
built
just
like
a
crow
only
much
smaller
that
season
one
of
the
jays
whistled
and
carried
on
till
i
thought
there
were
ever
so
many
birds
together
and
then
laughed
at
me
they
come
round
the
mill
for
sweepings
in
winter
but
they
are
almost
as
shy
as
crows
when
olaf
came
with
a
basket
and
some
hoes
the
doctor
told
dodo
she
might
take
off
her
shoes
and
stockings
and
go
down
on
the
sandbar
with
nat
and
olaf
to

clams
for

a
feathered
fisherman
the
osprey
before
the
day
was
over
the
children
were
so
in
love
with
olaf
with
the
beach
where
crabs
were
living
with
the
sea
over
which
water
birds
were
soaring
and
wished
to
know
so
many
things
that
the
doctor
told
them
the
only
way
to
satisfy
them
would
be
to
camp
on
the
shore
in
august
when
the
water
would
be
warm
enough
for
bathing
for
to
answer
all
the
questions
they
asked
would
take
a
month
and
then
you
can
tell
us
another
bookful
about
water
and
fish
and
crabs
and
sky
said
dodo
so
we
shall
have
a
bird
book
and
a
butterfly
book
and
olive
flower
book
yes
and
a
beast
book
too
said
nat
about
coons
and
bears
and
squirrels
and
foxes
you
know
rap
has
seen
foxes
right
on
our
farm
i
wish
i
knew
something
about
the
stars
and
the
rocks
too
said

very
earnestly
was
this

ever
young

yes
my
boy
everything
that
heart
of
nature
guides
had
a
beginning
and
was
once
young
what
is
that
an
eagle
cried
dodo
suddenly
pointing
up
to
a
very
large
bird
with
a
white
breast
and
tail
who
flew
over
the
bay
and
dived
into
the
water
illustration
osprey
it
the
fisherman
bird
said
olaf
some
call
it
the
fish
hawk
and
others
the
osprey
they
say
it
lives
all
over
north
america
but
it
goes
far
south
in
winter
and
when
it
conies
back
in
spring
we
know
the
fish
are
running
again
for
it
lives
on
the
fish
it
catches
and
wo
come
until
they
are
plenty
how
does
it
catch
fish
asked
dodo
it
hovers
overhead
until
it
sees
with
its
sharp
eye
a
fish
ripple
the
water
then
it
pounces
down
like
a
flash
and
grabs
the
fish
with
its
long
claws
that
are
made
like
if
the
fish
is
small
the
osprey
carries
it
home
easily
but
if
it
is
a
big
one
there
may
be
a
fight
sometimes
if
the
osprey
claws
get
caught
in
a
fish
too
large
to
fly
away
with
the
fisherman
bird
is
dragged
under
water
and
drowned
do
they
still
nest
on
round
island
asked
the
doctor
there
were
a
dozen
pairs
of
them
there
when
i
was
a
boy
yes
sir
but
there
is
only
one
pair
now
it
a
great
rack
of
sticks
half
as
big
as
a
haystack
for
they
mend
it
every
season
and
so
it
keeps
growing
until
now
it
is
almost
ready
to
fall
out
of
the
old
tree
that
holds
it
and
do
you
know
sir
that
purple
grackles
have
stuck
their
own
nests
into
the
sides
of
it
until
it
is
as
full
of
birds
as
a
great
summer
hotel
is
of
people
oh
we
must
see
it
said
olive
who
had
finished
putting
her
seaweeds
to
press
for
as
yet
i
have
only
read
about
such
a
nest
what
does
the
osprey
look
like
near
to
asked
rap
like
a
large
hawk
answered
the
doctor
you
would
know
him
to
be
a
hawk
by
his
hooked
beak
and
claws
he
walks
in
the
procession
of
bird
families
along
with
the
cannibal
birds
among
whom
he
belongs
and
who
come
after
the
birds
that
only
croak
and
call
but
he
is
not
a
real
cannibal
because
he
lives
on
fish
and
never
eats
birds
so
i
will
give
you
a
description
of
him
now
the
osprey
length
about
two
feet
upper
parts
dark
brown
with
some
white
on
the
head
and
neck
under
parts
white
with
some
dark
spots
feet
very
large
and
scaly
with
long
sharp
claws
to
hold
the
slippery
fishes
he
catches

citizen
of

a
very
industrious
fisherman
who
minds
his
own
business
and
does
nobody
any
harm
chapter
xx
some
sky
sweepers
about
four
after
a
long
rest
the
party
started
for
home
because
they
wanted
to
have
plenty
of
time
to
stop
in
the
wood
lane
on
the
way
the
first
bird
that
nat
spied
after
they
left
the
meadows
was
perching
on
the
topmost
wire
of
a
fence
by
the
roadside
every
once
in
a
while
he
darted
into
the
air
snapped
up
an
insect
and
returned
to
the
same
perch
on
the
wire
whence
he
had
started
he
was
a
very
bird
with
a
flaming
crest
that
he
raised
and
lowered
to
suit
himself
and
every
time
he
flew
into
the
air
he
cried
kyrie
kyrie
that
is
a
kingbird
said
the
doctor
it
is
very
kind
of
him
to
show
himself
for
he
is
the
bird
i
most
wished
to
see
we
have
finished
with
the
true
song
birds
now
and
the
next
order
is
that
of
the
songless
perching
birds
birds
that
have
some
of
them
quite
musical
but
no
true
song
so
we
will
name
them
the
birds
that
only
croak
and
call
the
crowing
of
a
rooster
the
screech
of
a
night
owl
the
hawk
harsh
scream
the
laughing
and
hammering
of
a
woodpecker
all
answer
the
same
good
purpose
as
a
song
the
first
family
of
songless
perching
birds
is
that
of
the
tyrant
flycatchers
and
the
first
of
these
birds
with
which
we
have
to
do
is
the
one
you
have
just
seen
he
belongs
to
the
guild
of
sky
sweepers
but
do
not
try
to
write
anything
down
while
we
are
driving
over
this
rough
road
the
surrey
jolts
too
much
you
need
only
listen
now
and
olive
will
help
you
with
your
the
kingbird
how
the
winged
insects
must
hate
a
kingbird
who
is
a
real
tyrant
over
them
and
must
seem
very
cruel
continued
the
doctor
he
sits
on
a
rail
or
wire
and
suddenly
flip
snap
a
fly
is
caught
flip
snap
a
wasp
dies
all
day
long
he
is
waging
war
and
helping
us
in
our
battle
with
the
bugs
if
he
happens
to
fancy
a
or
juicy
ant
he
dashes
to
the
leaf
or
on
which
the
insect
is
crawling
hovers
a
moment
in
the
air
to
take
aim
and
then
snatches
the
bug
off
so
clever
is
he
that
when
he
eats
bees
as
he
sometimes
does
he
seldom
takes
the
but
mainly
the
drones
perhaps
he
is
afraid
of
being
stung
what
is
a
drone
uncle
roy
asked
dodo
a
bee
which
does
not
work
for
its
living
and
can
not
sting
the
kingbird
is
proud
of
his
nest
which
he
often
confides
to
a
maple
on
the
edge
of
a
garden
or
to
your
pet
pear
tree
but
let
hawks
and
crows
beware
even
of
thinking
about
a
kingbird
nest
for
he
loves
his
home
and
hates
those
who
would
injure
it
and
what
is
more
he
is
not
one
bit
afraid
of
them
if
they
come
in
sight
he
attacks
them
bravely
and
drives
them
far
away
even
if
they
are
so
big
and
fierce
that
he
has
to
call
his
friends
to
help
him
so
that
the
robber
crow
or
cannibal
bird
is
lucky
if
he
does
not
lose
an
eye
before
he
escapes
illustration
kingbird
but
the
kingbird
is
not
quarrelsome
simply
very
lively
he
is
the
very
picture
of
dash
and
daring
in
defending
his
home
and
when
he
is
teaching
his
youngsters
how
to
fly
like
other
he
leaves
the
northerly
states
before
cold
weather
and
journeys
beyond

always
miss
him

yes
rather
late
about
the

he
is
a
lazy

then
perhaps
he
thinks
his

is
so
frail
that
he
needs
to
have
the
trees
in
full

to
protect
it

is

it

seems
so
from

point
of
view
for
he
is
a
happy
fussy
little
bird
and
i
dare
say
that
when
he
calls
he
is
only
saying
to
his
mate
on
the
other

would
it
be
nice
if
we

all
that
the

could

they

the
doctor
was
looking
for
them
this
time
i
am
looking
at
the
cows
themselves
those
over
there
are
beautiful
creatures
and
there
is
a
clear
spring
of
water
in
the
corner
of
the
pasture
when
we
come
to
the
farmhouse
where
they
belong
we
will
stop
to
buy
some
milk
and
miss
dodo
shall
have
supper
for
even
buns
when
they
have
been
travelling
about
all
day
in
a
basket
would
be
rather
dry
without
milk
but
would
the
milk
be
good
if
the
cows
were
not
pretty
and
there
was
no
spring
in
the
pasture
asked
nat
who
must
have
a
reason
for
everything
it
is
not
a
question
of
pretty
cows
it
is
whether
they
are
clean
and
healthy
or
not
that
makes
the
milk
good
or
bad
and
good
pure
water
to
drink
from
a
spring
that
is
not
near
any
barnyard
or
outbuilding
is
one
of
the
best
things
for
keeping
cows
in
good
health
meanwhile
they
had
driven
up
to
a
farmhouse
almost
as
large
as
their
own
and
the
mistress
who
was
arranging
her
pans
for
the
evening
milking
said
they
might
have
cold
milk
then
or
fresh
warm
milk
if
they
would
wait
a
little
while
until
the
cows
came
home
under
the
back
porch
was
a
cage
with
a
little
owl
in
it
and
the
woman
said
it
belonged
to
her
boy
joe
for
that
was
his
name
was
about
age
and
soon
made
friends
with
them
they
told
him
where
they
had
been
spending
the
day
and
about
their
uncle
wonder
room
and
the
birds
at
orchard
farm
have
you
got
a
hummingbird
nest
on
your
farm
and
a
swallow
chimney
joe
asked
anxiously
no
not
exactly
said
nat
hesitating
there
are
some
birds
in
uncle
roy
chimney
but
we
have
found
a
hummingbird
nest
yet
though
there
are
lots
of
the
birds
about
the
garden
well
there
a
hummingbird
nest
in
our
tree
and
we
own
the
biggest
swallow
chimney
there
is
in
the
county
pa
says
so
and
he
knows
said
joe
proudly
if
you
come
with
me
and
not
grab
the
nest
i
show
it
to
you
it
a
widow
hummingbird
too
i
never
seen
her
mate
since
she
began
to
set
but
before
that
he
was
always
flyin
round
the
honeysuckles
and
laylocks
so
i
sure
he
is
dead
may
i
come
too
asked
the
doctor
pleased
to
have
you
sir
said
joe
making
a
stiff
little
bow
have
asked
you
only
most
men
folks
do
set
much
store
by
birds
they
are
the
kind
they
go
gunnin
for
only
pa
does
he
likes
any
kind
o
bird
whether
it
sings
or
not
and
he
powerful
fond
of
the
swallows
in
our
chimney
he
says
they
eat
the
flies
and
things
that
tease
the
cows
down
in
the
pasture
and
since
those
swallows
came
to
our
chimney
we
have
had
to
put
on
the
oxen
when
they
are
in
the
pasture
not
once
now
children
you
see
what
good
the
sky
sweepers
do
said
the
doctor
sky
sweepers
we
do
call
that
we
call
chimney
swallows
then
the
children
told
joe
about
the
bird
brotherhoods
stand
on
this
box
said
joe
to
dodo
and
look
hard
at
that
small
slantways
branch
with
the
little
bunch
on
it
the
little
round
bunch
that
looks
like
soft
green
moss
yes
well
that
the
hummer
nest
oh
oh
cried
dodo
forgetting
to
whisper
i
see
a
mite
of
a
tail
and
a
sharp
needle
beak
sticking
over
the
edge
this
was
too
much
for
hummer
who
flew
off
with
a
whirr
like
an
angry
little
if
such
a
proper
puritan
thing
is
ever
angry
and
there
in
the
nest
were
two
tiny
eggs
like
white
beans
come
back
by
the
fence
and
watch
said
joe
she
does
like
to
leave
the
nest
much
when
it
is
toward
night
it
a
pity
her
mate
is
dead
how
lonely
she
must
be
said
dodo
who
had
a
tender
little
heart
i
do
not
think
her
mate
is
dead
said
the
doctor
he
is
merely
staying
away
after
a
custom
of
his
family
the
bird
whose
nest
we
see
there
is
called
the
hummingbird
because
he
has
a
patch
of
glittering
feathers
under
his
chin
at
the
top
of
his
vest
that
hardly
shows
any
while
he
wears
a
beautiful
with
its
dark
purplish
tails
deeply
forked
his
wife
looks
very
much
like
him
only
she
has
no
ruby
jewels
to
wear
bold
as
this
bird
is
in
darting
about
and
chasing
larger
ones
he
is
less
than
four
inches
long
only
about
the
size
of
one
of
the
that
come
out
to
feed
just
as
this
valiant
pygmy
lancer
leaves
the
flowers
for
the
night
these
hummingbirds
live
on
honey
and
very
small
insects
and
dread
the
cold
so
that
they
spend
the
winter
southward
from
florida
but
as
soon
as
real
spring
warmth
comes
they
spread
over
the
united
states
east
of
the
plains
and
north
even
to
the
fur
countries
they
are
the
only
kind
found
in
the
eastern
half
of
north
america
though
there
are
more
than
a
dozen
other
species
in
the
west
most
of
them
near
the
mexican
borders
of
the
united
states
when
the
hummers
arrive
here
early
in
may
we
see
the
brilliant
males
darting
about
sometimes
i
am
sorry
to
say
quarrelling
with
their
rivals
and
giving
shrill
cries
like
the
squeaking
of
young
mice
the
last
of
may
the
dainty
nest
is
made
of
and
lichen
scales
then
the
male
goes
off
by
himself
and
sulks
you
may
see
him
feeding
but
he
keeps
away
from
the
nest
selfish
bird
that
he
is
until
the
little
ones
are
ready
to
fly
meanwhile
the
mother
takes
all
the
care
and
trouble
herself
feeding
her
little
hummers
in
a
peculiar
way
she
swallows
tiny
insects
and
when
they
have
remained
a
little
while
in
her
crop
she
opens
her
beak
into
which
the
young
bird
puts
its
own
and
sucks
the
softened
food
as
a
baby
does
milk
from
its
bottle
i
was
wondering
this
very
morning
said
joe
how
the
old
bird
was
going
to
feed
her
young
ones
when
those
two
eggs
hatched
without
any
mate
to
help
her
i
real
glad
you
came
along
to
explain
it
sir
somehow
the
reasons
lots
of
folk
give
for
things
are
reasonable
at
all
now

the

swift
now
would
you
like
to
see
the
big
chimney
asked
joe
the
birds
go
in
and
out
a
good
deal
this
time
o
day
it
across
the
road
there
where
the
old
house
used
to
be
the
house
is
all
gone
but
the
chimney
is
as
strong
as
ever
i
can
climb
up
top
and
look
down
at
the
nests
inside
see
there
it
is
now
looking
over
the
fence
they
saw
a
tall
stack
of
worn
gray
stones
that
looked
more
like
a
tower
than
a
chimney
small
blackish
birds
kept
streaming
from
the
top
circling
high
in
the
air
and
darting
down
again
all
twittering
as
they
dropped
one
after
another
out
of
sight
inside
the
pile
look
children
said
the
doctor
these
are
chimney
swifts
usually
called
chimney
swallows
and
their
color
is
like
soot
to
match
the
places
they
live
in
are
they
any
relations
of
swallows
asked
rap
no
my
boy
they
look
like
swallows
but
as
i
think
olive
told
you
once
the
swifts
are
a
family
all
by
themselves
this
one
lives
in
the
eastern
half
of
the
country
in
summer
and
goes
far
south
for
the
winter
when
he
lives
in
a
wild
region
he
chooses
a
hollow
tree
for
his
nesting
place
as
his
ancestors
always
did
before
there
were
any
houses
or
chimneys
illustration
chimney
swift
the
flight
of
the
swift
is
so
rapid
that
at
times
it
is
almost
impossible
for
the
quickest
eye
to
follow
him
his
wings
are
very
strong
and
almost
as
long
as
all
the
rest
of
his
body
short
and
blunt
as
his
tail
looks
when
he
flies
each
feather
ends
in
a
hard
sharp
point
which
sticks
out
beyond
the
soft
part
they
feed
on
insects
which
they
catch
as
they
dash
through
the
air
and
can
also
break
off
dry
twigs
for
without
stopping
sometimes
seizing
the
little
sticks
in
their
bills
and
sometimes
in
their
claws
which
are
much
stronger
than
those
of
swallows
how
do
they
make
the
sticks
stay
in
the
chimney
what
do
they
set
them
on
and
how
do
they
perch
while
they
are
building
asked
nat
all
in
one
breath
do
you
remember
how
the
little
brown
creeper
propped
himself
against
the
tree
when
he
looked
for
insects
yes
said
rap
he
stuck
his
sharp
into
the
bark
and
made
a
bracket
of
himself
the
swift
does
this
also
when
he
fastens
twigs
together
for
a
nest
they
are
glued
together
into
a
little
openwork
basket
and
gummed
to
the
wall
of
the
chimney
with
a
sticky
fluid
which
comes
from
his
own
mouth
i
got
a
lot
of
old
nests
that
fell
down
the
chimney
after
a
storm
last
winter
that
wet
the
glue
and
made
them
come
unstuck
said
joe
and
i
give
you
each
one
if
you
look
up
the
hole
where
the
kitchen
fireplace
was
you
can
see
the
new
nests
quite
plain
for
the
birds
do
build
them
very
near
the
top
be
careful
of
loose
stones
called
the
doctor
but
in
a
flash
four
young
heads
had
disappeared
in
the
ruins
of
the
great
fireplace
where
three
pairs
of
trousers
and
a
short
brown
linen
skirt
alone
were
visible
in
a
little
while
they
had
some
milk
and
strawberries
and
before
they
drove
on
joe
father
promised
to
take
him
up
to
orchard
farm
to
see
the
birds
in
the
doctor
wonder
room
as
soon
as
haying
should
be
over
to
the
children
astonishment
they
found
it
was
six
they
had
been
at
the
farm
an
hour
and
a
half
and
could
not
stop
again
until
they
reached
the
wood
lane
where
their
uncle
had
promised
to
look
for
the
pewee
nest
stay
here
little
people
and
ask
all
the
questions
you
like
of
olive
said
the
doctor
when
they
had
reached
the
lane
for
i
shall
be
able
to
find
the
nest
more
easily
if
you
do
not
frighten
the
birds
by
talking
pewee
pewee
cried
a
little
voice
there
he
is
crying
again
said
dodo
please
olive
wo
you
tell
us
the
table
for
the
chimney

and
there
is
plenty
of

the
shape
of
a

come
softly
said
the
doctor
returning
to
the
roadside
i
have
found
the
pewee
nest
it
is
quite
new
and
has
no
eggs
in
it
as
yet
this
way
up
along
this
ledge
of
rocks
and
you
can
almost
look
into
it
they
moved
quietly
over
the
rocks
until
they
reached
a
pepperidge
tree
when
the
doctor
motioned
them
to
stop
and
pointed
to
one
of
its
branches
which
stretched
over
the
rock
there
was
a
flat
nest
with
an
evenly
rounded
edge
all
covered
with
lichen
scales
outside
it
is
just
like
a
hummingbird

is
it
made
of
too
no
of
fine
grasses
rootlets
and
bits
of
bark
said
the
doctor
and
in
a
few
days
it
will
hold
three
or
four
eggs
prettily
wreathed
around
one
end
with

the

the
sun
was
quite
low
when
the
party
drove
out
of
the
lane
the
birds
were
singing
their
very
best
and
olive
stopped
the
horses
on
top
of
the
next
hill
that
they
might
all
look
at
the
beautiful
twilight
picture
around
them
how
quickly
the
sun
slides
when
it
once
begins
to
go
said
nat
it
looks
as
if
it
were
going
into
a
cage
with
the
striped
clouds
for
bars
shirk
shirk
boom
a
large
bird
that
had
been
sailing
about
overhead
dropped
through
the
air
till
it
was
almost
over
the
surrey
then
turned
suddenly
and
darted
upward
again
what
is
that
cried
nat
and
dodo
that
a
nighthawk
do
you
remember
the
bird
we
heard
early
one
morning
in
the
river
woods
he
looking
for
small
birds
to
eat
answered
rap
he
is
called
the
nighthawk
but
never
eats
anything
except
beetles
flies
and
other
insects
said
the
doctor
for
he
is
not
a
real
hawk
he
takes
his
name
from
the
fact
that
he
dashes
about
at
twilight
and
in
cloudy
weather
like
a
hawk
but
his
broad
shallow
mouth
is
only
suitable
for
like
his
cousin
the
chimney
swift
and
the
beak
is
equally
small
and
feeble
not
at
all
like
the
strong
hooked
one
of
a
cannibal
bird
look
overhead
there
are
two
light
spots
like
holes
through
his
wings
said
rap
ah
yes
now
i
remember
about
him
we
can
always
tell
him
from
a
real
hawk
how
does
he
make
that
queer
noise
asked
nat
it
sounds
like
when
i
hit
the
telegraph
wires
with
stones
or
blow
in
the
bunghole
of
a
barrel
illustration
nighthawk
watch
him
when
he
drops
said
the
doctor
do
you
not
see
that
he
does
so
with
open
wings
the
air
rushes
between
the
long
and
makes
the
vibrating
noise
now
he
is
up
and
away
again
but
you
see
he
keeps
circling
in
the
sky
does
he
build
in
chimneys
asked
dodo
the
nighthawk
does
not
build
any
nest
the
eggs
are
laid
on
bare
ground
or
rock
in
an
open
field
occasionally
on
a
strange
as
this
seems
the
parent
birds
are
so
near
the
color
of
earth
and
rock
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
find
them
when
they
are
sitting
the
young
when
hatched
are
equally
invisible
and
the
eggs
themselves
look
like
two
little
stones
for
there
are
never
more
than
two
i
will
show
you
a
nighthawk
in
my
cabinet
and
you
will
see
for
yourselves
how
nicely
the
colors
match
ground
and
rocks
he
looks
like
a
pretty
big
bird
said
dodo
how
long
is
he
is
there
only
one
in
his
family
he
has
a

should

shy
neighbor
but
a
valuable
citizen
belonging
to
the
ground
gleaners
as
well
as
sky
sweepers
the
this
mysterious
bird
is
also
a
dweller
in
lonely
places
feeding
at

in
the
woods
having
no
nest
and
laying
the
eggs
in
a
hollow
in
the
ground
or
on
a

he
is
so
nearly
of
the
color
of

earth

that
you
may
pass
near
him
a
hundred
times
and
never
see
him
then
too
when
he
perches
in
the
he
does
not
sit
across
a
branch
like
other
birds
but
lengthwise
so
that
house
people
and
cats
can
not
see
him
from
below
or
cannibal
birds
from
above
he
is
an
and
so
goes
southward
before
hard
frosts
does
this
bird
make
any
noise
and
why
is
he
called
the
asked
nat
that
is
such
a
funny
name
rap
was
about
to
answer
when
the
doctor
signed
to
him
and
he
stopped
call
their
own
name
after
dark
and
i
think
you
will
hear
them
when
we
pass
the
miller
woods
in
a
few
minutes
for
some
reason
they
seldom
come
about
the
farm
i

i
am

to
be
polite
and

i
do
think
any
of

will
sit
up
much
later
than
the
birds
i
hear
a

a

cried
a

voice
close
by
and
something

its

oh

cried
dodo
waking
suddenly
that
must
be

for
he
called
his

as
plain
as
the
chickadee
does
and
listen
there
are
more
of
them
all
up
the
hill
soon
they
passed

and
left
him
at

the

in

ran
out

chapter
xxiii
a
laughing
family
when
the
children
had
their
uncle
with
them
and
could
listen
to
his
stories
it
seemed
very
easy
to
name
the
birds
but
when
they
were
alone
it
was
quite
a
different
matter
the
birds
had
a
way
of
moving
on
at
exactly
the
wrong
moment
of
course
they
made
some
very
funny
mistakes
and
at
times
grew
quite
discouraged
i
thought
we
could
learn
a
hundred
birds
in
no
time
said
nat
to
olive
one
morning
but
i
only
pop
sure
of
ten
when
they
fly
in
a
hurry
and
about
ten
more
when
they
sit
still
and
let
me
take
a
good
look
at
them
i
think
that
is
doing
very
well
indeed
for
watching
live
birds
is
not
a
bit
like
learning
rules
and
figures
by
heart
though
your
tables
give
you
some
facts
about
birds
colors
and
habits
every
bird
has
some
little
ways
and
tricks
of
his
very
own
that
are
always
a
surprise
and
then
you
see
a
bird
in
the
hand
looks
very
different
from
a
bird
in
the
bush
i
suppose
that
is
why
uncle
wants
us
to
go
out
to
see
for
ourselves
instead
of
telling
us
stories
every
day
this
morning
when
i
was
over
in
the
miller
woods
where
we
heard
the
i
saw
the
queerest
bird
running
up
a
tree
he
let
me
come
close
to
without
being
frightened
illustration
downy
woodpecker
at
first
i
thought
he
was
a
creeper
for
he
was
all
black
and
white
then
i
saw
he
was
much
bigger
and
the
beak
was
square
at
the
end
as
if
it
was
cut
off
instead
of
being
he
had
the
strangest
feet
two
toes
behind
and
two
in
front
and
when
he
came
down
near
where
i
stood
i
saw
a
spot
on
the
head
when
i
went
a
step
nearer
he
did
like
it
and
then
laughed
out
loud
at
me
cher
cher
cher
cher
ha
ha
ha
ha
i
thought
he
might
be
some
kind
of
a
woodpecker
but
those
in
uncle
room
are
a
great
deal
bigger
a
very
good
description
of
the
downy
woodpecker
said
the
doctor
coming
up
under
the
porch
where
they
were
sitting
this
bird
belongs
not
only
to
a
different
family
from
any
you
have
heard
about
but
to
a
different
order
also
you
have
seen
that
perching
birds
all
have
three
toes
in
front
and
one
behind
on
the
same
level
so
that
they
may
easily
grasp
a
perch
and
keep
their
balance
but
woodpeckers
do
not
perch
in
the
true
sense
they
rest
either
against
a
or
on
a
limb
and
even
sleep
in
these
positions
they
almost
all
have
four
toes
two
in
front
and
two
behind
and
the
strong
pair
of
hind
toes
prop
them
up
when
they
climb
the
trunks
of
trees
or
when
they
stop
to
bore
for
their
food
they
also
have
stiff
pointed
that
they
press
against
the
upright
trunks
of
trees
to
keep
themselves
in
place
the
same
as
swifts
do
inside
chimneys
or
brown
creepers
scrambling
about
trees
so
they
make
brackets
of
themselves
as
rap
says
their
bills
are
strong
and
straight
like
chisels
so
that
they
may
cut
and
gouge
hard
wood
without
breaking
them
besides
all
this
they
have
curious
long
fleshy
tongues
with
horny
barbed
tips
which
they
can
thrust
far
out
of
their
mouths
to
spear
their
insect
food
from
holes
and
crannies
can
any
of
them
sing
asked
nat
they
belong
to
an
entirely
songless
group
but
have
several
ways
of
calling
and
signalling
to
each
other
one
of
these
is
to
beat
rapidly
on
a
tree
with
the
beak
which
makes
a
rolling
noise
each
different
species
doing
his
drumming
in
his
own
way
besides
this
they
all
have
jolly
laughing
notes
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
most
of
them
are
rather
shy
birds
hence
they
are
often
called
the
laughing
family
are
there
many
kinds
of
woodpeckers
in
north
america
more
than
twenty
but
you
are
likely
to
notice
only
a
few
of
them
i
am
sure
however
that
you
will
be
good
friends
with
four
kinds
before
snowfall
the
downy
woodpecker
that
you
saw
this
morning
the
beautiful
flicker
the
gay
woodpecker
so
glossy
and
white
and
the
mischievous
spotted
sapsucker
who
visits
us
in
autumn
you
will
find
them
very
different
in
looks
and
habits
in
spite
of
their
being
cousins
uncle
uncle
roy
cried
dodo
running
through
the
orchard
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
there
is
a
very
handsome
rare
wonderful
kind
of
a
meadowlark
walking
on
the
lawn
by
the
front
steps
it
brown
speckled
with
black
and
has
a
black
patch
on
the
breast
and
red
on
the
head
and
when
he
flies
you
can
see
a
white
spot
over
the
tail
do
you
think
he
has
come
out
of
a
cage
no
missy
that
is
not
a
meadowlark
is
not
rare
or
wonderful
and
has
not
been
in
a
cage
that
is
an
sort
of
a
woodpecker
having
many
names
some
think
he
is
called
the
flicker
because
he
has
a
way
of
flicking
his
wings
and
the
yellow
hammer
because
he
hammers
on
trees
with
the
beak
and
has
fine
golden
the
nest
of
the
one
you
saw
is
in
a
hole
high
up
in
the
old
sassafras
by
the
side
fence
and
some
say
that
this
is
why
another
of
his
names
is
but
it
received
all
three
of
those
names
for
other
reasons
you
need
not
bother
your
head
about
just
now
there
are
young
birds
in
the
nest
now
and
if
you
tap
on
the
trunk
with
a
stick
you
will
hear
them
making
a
noise
this
seems
to
be
woodpecker
day
for
nat
has
seen
the
little
downy
in
the
woods
you
have
seen
the
flicker
on
the
lawn
and
i
was
telling
him
about
two
others
so
you
are
just
in
time
to
be
too
late
now
write
the
table
for
nat
downy
first
and
then
we
will
have
the
rest
of
the
woodpeckers
the
downy
woodpecker
the
smallest
north
american
woodpecker
hardly
seven
inches
long
upper
parts
black
with
a
long
white
patch
on
middle
of
back
wings
spotted
with
black
and
white
some
black
and
white
bars
on
the
outside
red
band
on
back
of
head
of
the
male
but
not
of
the
female
under
parts
all
white
a
citizen
of
the
eastern
half
of
north
america
where
he
stays
all
the
year
round
a
good
and
useful
neighbor
one
of
the
best
does
not
bore
holes
in
trees
to
injure
them
or
eat
the
sap
but
to
get
at
the
hurtful
grubs
which
live
under
the
bark
and
the
sharp
barbed
tongue
is
especially
fitted
to
pick
thorn
out
of
the
holes
which
are
dug
with
the
stout
beak
eats
a
little
fruit
berries
and
is
a
member
of
the
guilds
of
tree
trappers
and
ground
gleaners
as
he
eats
not
only
grubs
but
ants
beetles
bugs
caterpillars
and
spiders
he
is
also
a
seed
sower
though
in
being
so
he
and
his
brothers
without
intentional
mischief
scatter
the
seeds
from
the
watery
white
berries
of
the
poison
ivy
he
always
digs
for
himself
a
nest
in
some
partly
decayed
tree
and
never
takes
long
journeys
but
moves
about
only
in
search
of
food
the
woodpecker
there
that
will
do
for
the
downy
continued
the
doctor
as
the
children
finished
the
table
only
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
i
have
a
friend
who
calls
him
the
flying
because
he
looks
when
he
flies
as
if
he
were
checkered
all
over
in
squares
of
two
colors
black
and
white
the
is
a
much
gayer
bird
with
three
colors
ha
there
goes
one
now
this
is
woodpecker
day
indeed
and
we
are
in
luck
a
very
handsome
bird
glittering
in
the
sun
had
come
looping
swiftly
past
and
swung
himself
up
to
the
top
of
a
tall
tree
where
he
rattled
a
loud
rataplan
as
much
as
to
say
am
i
not
a
fine
fellow
yes
i
know
him
said
rap
eagerly
there
a
pair
that
have
a
nest
in
our
orchard
the
same
i
guess
that
were
there
last
year
when
they
raised
a
brood
only
when
the
young
ones
came
out
they
had
gray
heads
instead
of
red
ones
and
their
wings
were
not
clear
white
like
this
one
nor
their
backs
so
shiny
black
is
that
right
doctor
illustration
woodpecker
yes
my
boy
and
it
shows
you
know
how
to
use
your
eyes
for
young
look
very
different
from
their
parents
till
they
get
a
new
suit
you
remember
that
we
called
the
bluebird
the
flag
bird
on
account
of
his
three
colors
but
this
woodpecker
has
the
red
of
the
head
much
brighter
than
a
bluebird
breast
and
shows
purer
white
as
he
flies
in
large
spaces
on
his
back
and
wings
though
his
blue
is
not
so
bright
it
is
what
we
call
very
dark
and
glossy
like
polished
steel
do
they
stay
around
all
the
year
asked
nat
some
of
them
do
but
not
many
they
are
very
common
in
summer
but
not
as
hardy
as
the
downies
and
most
of
them
go
off
south
for
the
winter
they
are
very
merry
frolicsome
birds
with
all
sorts
of
tricks
and
manners
even
dodo
flickers
are
no
jollier
members
of
the
laughing
family
do
they
work
when
they
are
through
playing
asked
nat
and
do
any
good
yes
indeed
answered
the
doctor
all
kinds
of
woodpeckers
are
industrious
workers
and
all
of
them
except
the
sapsuckers
are
very
useful
to
us
in
destroying
hurtful
insects
what
kind
of
eggs
do
they
lay
asked
dodo
it
must
be
hard
to
get
a
look
at
them
in
such
deep
holes
so
high
up
very
pretty
ones
indeed
replied
the
doctor
they
are
not
very
easy
to
reach
though
you
can
readily
see
the
rounded
hole
that
leads
into
the
nest
for
it
is
almost
always
bored
in
a
bare
dead
part
of
the
tree
i
can
show
you
some
woodpecker
eggs
in
my
cabinet
they
are
all
alike
except
in
size
more
round
than
most
birds
eggs
are
very
smooth
and
glossy
like
porcelain
and
pure
white
but
now
write
your
table
while
that
is
still
in
sight
it
is
a
very
easy
one
his
colors
are
plain
and
you
can
guess
pretty
nearly
how
long
he
is
the
woodpecker
length
about
nine
inches
head
and
neck
all
around
back
and
most
of
wings
and
tail
glossy
all
the
rest
except
a
little
red
tinge
on
the
belly
young
ones
gray
whore
the
old
ones
are
red
and
not
so
pure
black
and
white
in
other
places
a
citizen
of
the
eastern
half
of
the
united
states
and
some
parts
of
canada
but
mostly
going
to
the
southern
states
for
the
winter
a
good
neighbor
and
useful
member
of
the
guilds
of
tree
trappers
and
ground
gleaners
he
takes
some
of
our
fruits
now
and
then
but
is
welcome
to
them
for
the
good
he
does
in
destroying
insects
which
would
injure
and
perhaps
kill
our
fruit
trees
if
he
did
not
eat
his
full
share
of
them
and
he
has
to
work
very
hard
to
dig
them
out
of
the
places
where
they
lurk
under
the
bark
the
flicker
the
flicker
beak
is
more
slender
and
curving
than
those
of
his
brethren
and
he
has
an
extremely
long
barbed
tongue
which
he
uses
to
probe
the
sticky
substance
in
the
bird
mouth
covers
the
little
barbs
on
its
tongue
and
thus
he
is
able
to
catch
a
great
many
ants
at
a
time
he
is
one
of
our
best
are
ants
very
bad
things
if
they
do
get
into
the
sugar
asked
dodo
there
are
a
great
many
kinds
of
ants
though
all
may
not
be
harmful
some
of
them
do
great
damage
by
destroying
timber
or
ripe
fruit
and
helping
to
spread
lice
about
the
roots
of
all
sorts
of
plants
the
flicker
has
a
jolly
laughing
call
that
sounds
like
repeated
very
quickly
and
he
also
hammers
away
on
a
tree
in
fine
style
when
he
wishes
to
call
his
mate
or
let
her
know
his
whereabouts
like
other
woodpeckers
he
hollows
out
a
soft
spot
in
a
tree
until
he
has
made
quite
a
deep
hole
which
with
a
few
chips
in
the
bottom
for
bedding
serves
as
his
nest
most
little
woodpeckers
climb
up
to
the
to
be
fed
but
young
flickers
are
fed
in
the
same
way
as
little
hummingbirds
the
parent
swallowing
food
and
when
it
is
softened
bringing
it
back
from
the
crop
by
pressing
on
it
with
the
beak
what
is
the
crop
asked
dodo
it
is
an
elastic
pouch
in
the
gullet
of
a
bird
where
food
that
has
been
swallowed
is
kept
for
a
while
before
it
goes
further
down
into
the
stomach
you
have
seen
this
crop
in
the
necks
of
chickens
and
pigeons
oh
yes
a
round
place
but
what
is
the
good
of
it
persisted
dodo
it
is
a
for
food
where
it
may
swell
soften
and
be
partly
ground
up
all
birds
are
fond
of
eating
sand
and
gravel
oh
yes
my
canary
picks
up
lots
of
little
bits
every
time
i
put
fresh
sand
in
his
cage
this
gravel
mixes
with
the
food
and
helps
to
grind
it
up
you
ran
understand
how
necessary
this
is
when
you
remember
that
some
birds
like
pigeons
swallow
hard
grains
of
corn
entirely
whole
yes
and
i
saw
mammy
bun
clean
a
chicken
yesterday
said
nat
there
was
a
lot
of
sand
and
corn
in
a

so
that

flicker
to
return
to
the
flickers
they
live
in
flocks
in
autumn
and
when
a
number
are
feeding
on
the
ground
at
a
little
distance
they
might
be
taken
for
meadowlarks
so
you
see
that
you
did
not
make
such
a
dreadful
mistake
after
all
little
girl
wo
you
come
over
to
the
miller
woods
with
us
uncle
and
perhaps
we
can
find
the
downy
nest
hole
said
nat
yes
i
will
come
and
tell
you
about
the
fourth
woodpecker
on
the
way
the
one
called
the
sapsucker
though
very
handsome
this
is
not
a
bird
that
you
would
care
to
have
come
in
great
numbers
to
your
garden
or
orchard
for
this
bird
makes
holes
in
the
tree
bark
and
eats
the
sap
that
leaks
out
from
this
habit
gaining
the
name
of
sapsucker
of
course
you
see
that
this
is
a
very
bad
thing
for
the
trees
for
when
a
great
many
holes
have
been
bored
near
together
the
bark
loosens
and
peels
off
so
that
the
tree
is
likely
to
die
the
also
does
harm
by
eating
the
soft
inner
bark
which
is
between
the
rough
outside
bark
and
the
hard
of
the
tree
for
this
soft
bark
is
where
the
sap
flows
to
nourish
the
tree
illustration
sapsucker
when
the
bird
bores
the
holes
and
the
sap
oozes
out
a
great
many
insects
gather
to
feed
on
it
hornets
wasps
spiders
beetles
flies
and
other
kinds
these
the
sapsucker
also
eats
sweeping
them
up
in
the
sap
with
his
tongue
which
is
not
barbed
like
that
of
other
woodpeckers
but
has
a
little
brush
on
the
end
of
it
shaped
something
like
those
we
use
for
cleaning
lamp
chimneys
in
this
way
he
can
easily
lick
up
great
quantities
of
both
sap
and
insects
you
will
not
probably
see
him
before
autumn
for
he
nests
northward
from
massachusetts
but
you
can
write
down
his
table
now
and
then
be
on

for
him

a

unwelcome
in

not

of

i
wonder
if
i

the

as
she
skipped
down
the

between
her

said
nat
it
does
do
at
all
when
you
are

says
you
must
go
quietly
and
not
swing
your
arms
either
for
it
frightens
birds
more
than
even
a
scarecrow
it
is
very
hard
to
keep
still
when
you
are
bursting
with
hurry
to
get
somewhere
answered
dodo
very
meekly
but
not
wholly
able
to
resist
an
occasional
jump
i
show
you
the
way
said
nat
the
little

was

of

the

a
beautiful
but
a

two

fellows

cried
a
harsh
voice
from
the
wood
edge
rattled
another
bird
from
over
the
river
bank
those
must
both
be
woodpeckers
said
the
children
for
both
noises
are
like
hammering
yes
continued
nat
and
i
see
the
one
who
made
the
rattle
it
is
a
woodpecker
with
a
very
big
head
and
bob
tail
and
sort
of
gray
with
black
straps
in
front
see
uncle
he
is
on
a
branch
of
that
dead
tree
right
over
the
river
there
he
has
fallen
off
into
the
water
the
doctor
smiled
as
he
said
here
is
another
case
of
mistaken
identity
very
much
like
dodo
with
her
rare
meadowlark
this
bird
is
a
kingfisher
who
did
not
fall
into
the
water
but
dived
in
after
the
fish
for
which
he
sat
watching
so
some
wood
birds
eat
fish
as
well
as
the
osprey
that
we
saw
at
the
beach
but
how
do
they
chew
them
uncle
roy
they
do
not
chew
them
if
the
fish
is
not
too
large
they
swallow
it
whole
and
very
funny
faces
they
make
sometimes
in
doing
so
if
it
is
too
large
they
beat
it
against
a
branch
and
tear
it
before
eating
as
they
live
on
fish
they
make
their
home
near
water
and
only
travel
south
when
the
rivers
freeze
do
they
build
nests
in
trees
asked
dodo
no
they
burrow
tunnels
in
the
earth
of
river
banks
and
put
their
nests
at
the
end
of
them
just
as
the
bank
swallow
does
only
the
kingfisher
tunnel
is
much
larger
and
his
nest
is
not
nicely
lined
with
feathers
the
young
often
have
no
softer
bed
than
a
few

a
rather
startling
amusing
neighbor
who
always
minds
ins
own
business
and
is
an
industrious
fisherman
what
was
the
other
bird
who
cried
kuk
on
the
outside
of
the
woods
there
it
is
calling
again
i
sure
that
it
is
a
woodpecker
wrong
again
it
is
a
cuckoo
the
one
i
think
for
the
voice
is
louder
and
harsher
than
that
of
his
brother
illustration
cuckoo
what
a
little
blue
and
white
bird
like
the
one
that
bobs
out
of
mother
carved
clock
at
home
oh
do
let
us
try
to
find
it
but
this
bird
did
say
it
only
cackled
something
like
a
hen
when
she
is
tired
of
sitting
the
clock
cuckoo
is
an
imitation
of
the
merry
heedless
english
bird
who
lays
her
eggs
in
the
wrong
nests
as
our
cowbird
does
the
cuckoo
is
quite
different
being
long
slender
and
graceful
and
a
very
patient
parent
even
though
the
nest
she
builds
is
rather
a
poor
thing
made
of
a
few
twigs
piled
so
loosely
in
a
bush
that
the
eggs
sometimes
drop
out
let
us
go
over
to
the
brush
hedge
where
the
bird
seemed
to
be
hush
there
he
sits
upon
the
limb
of
a
maple
no
look
a
little
higher
up
he
is
perfectly
still
and
acts
as
if
he
was
half
asleep
see
what
a
powerful
bill
he
has
with
that
he
tears
away
the
ugly
webs
of
from
the
fruit
trees
and
sometimes
eats
more
than
forty
caterpillars
without
stopping
he
is
so
fond
of
them
look
at
him
through
the
glass
and
see
if
the
following
description
fits
him
the
cuckoo
length
about
twelve
inches
upper
parts
or
quaker

all
over

and
shiny

south

a
very
valuable
neighbor
and
an
officer
of
high
rank
in
the
guild
of
tree
trappers
his
brother
the
cuckoo
is
very
much
like
him
except
that
the
tail
is
not
black
its
spots
are
smaller
and
he
has
no
yellow
on
the
bill
but
a
red
ring
round
the
eye
couk
cried
the
bird
as
he
spread
his
wings
and
sailed
off
giving
the
children
a
fine
chance
to
see
his
long
rounded
black
tail
with
the
white
spots
are
there
any
owls
in
these
woods
uncle
roy
asked
nat
you
know
we
have
seen
an
owl
yet
though
we
hear
one
almost
every
night
doubtless
there
are
but
the
best
place
to
find
owls
is
in
the
old
wood
far
up
by
the
lake
where
the
lumbermen
have
their
camp
the
great
horned
owl
nests
there
and
many
hawks
besides
i
will
take
you
all
there
some
day
and
if
you
do
not
find
the
birds
themselves
you
can
see
the
wild
places
where
they
like
to
nest
could
we
go
very
soon
uncle
next
week
perhaps
urged
dodo
fourth
of
july
comes
next
week
said
nat
and
uncle
said
we
could
go
down
to
the
shore
again
and
take
our
it
will
be
such
fun
to
stick
them
in
rows
in
the
sand
and
make
them
sizzle
more
fun
even
than
owls
do
you
think
so
dodo
he
asked
anxiously
oh
yes
and
then
it
would
be
polite
either
not
to
have
on
the
fourth
of
july
i
think
the
american
eagle
or
the
president
or
somebody
expects
children
to
have
mammy
bun
says
the
first
american
eagle
was
hatched
on
the
fourth
of
july
you
know
said
dodo
earnestly
do
you
think
he
was
uncle
no
it
was
the
united
states
that
were
hatched
on
the
fourth
of
july
seventeen
seventy
six
said
nat
hesitating
a
little
over
the
date
you
are
both
right
in
a
way
laughed
the
doctor
but
you
need
not
give
up
the
owls
in
order
to
celebrate
the
eagle
birthday
we
will
have
an
eagle
birthday
party
at
the
beach
on
the
fourth
and
on
the
eighth
which
is
dodo
birthday
if
i
am
not
mistaken
we
will
have
an
owl
party
up
at
the
lake
oh
oh
how
lovely
cried
dodo
giving
her
uncle
such
a
sudden
hug
and
kiss
that
his
hat
flew
off
and
the
lake
is
a
long
way
off
so
first
we
go
in
the
cars
and
then
in
a
big
hay
wagon
with
straw
in
the
bottom
at
least
that
is
the
way
olive
said
she
went
the
last
time
chapter

cannibals
in
court
dodo
birthday
and
a
disappointment
came
together
on
the
eighth
and
the
disappointment
took
the
shape
of
a
rainy
day
not
an
early
morning
shower
with
promise
of
warmth
and
clear
weather
for
it
was
one
of
the
cold
northeasterly
storms
that
are
very
trying
at
any
time
of
the
year
but
doubly
so
when
they
come
in
july
and
seem
for
the
time
to
turn
summer
into
autumn
dodo
nat
rap
and
olive
stood
under
the
shelter
of
the
porch
the
children
vainly
hoping
that
it
might
clear
up
before
nine
the
hour
the
train
left
and
olive
racking
her
brain
for
something
that
would
soothe
their
feelings
we
might
ask
mammy
to
let
us
go
into
the
kitchen
and
make
candy
she
said
the
weather
is
too
damp
and
sticky
for
molasses
candy
but
will
harden
if
we
put
it
in
the
dairy
even
this
did
not
seem
to
be
very
tempting
to
little
people
who
had
expected
to
go
to
the
real
owl
woods
and
quick
barked
and
yelped
as
if
he
too
felt
cheated
out
of
an
expected
excursion
presently
the
doctor
came
out
and
saw
the
forlorn
group
which
being
quite
heedless
of
the
sharp
slant
of
the
rain
was
rather
wet
and
limp
poor
little
he
said
rather
too
cheerfully
they
thought
you
look
as
unhappy
as
the
party
of
astronomers
who
went
all
the
way
to
africa
to
photograph
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
and
when
the
time
came
were
so
excited
that
they
forgot
to
open
the
camera
and
so
took
no
pictures
come
into
the
hall
and
i
will
tell
you
about
a
plan
i
have
catching
cold
is
a
nice
game
for
a
birthday
party
you
expected
to
hear
something
about
the
cannibal
birds
and
see
the
woods
where
a
great
many
of
them
live
and
make
their
nests
you
yes
said
dodo
we
wanted
to
know
why
they
are
cannibals
and
see
where
the
wicked
things
live
that
eat
little
chickens
and
song
birds
very
well
now
do
you
know
that
though
all
hawks
and
owls
sometimes
eat
other
birds
and
help
themselves
to
poultry
from
the
barnyards
yet
at
the
same
time
most
of
them
are
the
farmer
best
friends
no
said
rap
i
thought
they
were
all
bad
evil
birds
and
that
the
government
often
gave
money
to
people
for
killing
them
besides
i
am
sure
that
a
hawk
took
eleven
of
our
little
chickens
this
very
spring
the
wise
men
have
been
looking
up
the
records
of
these
cannibals
or
birds
of
prey
as
they
are
usually
called
and
find
that
very
few
of
them
only
two
or
three
kinds
perhaps
should
be
condemned
to
death
the
others
belong
to
the
secret
guild
of
the
wise
watchers
who
sitting
silently
in
the
shadows
of
the
woods
or
perching
in
the
trees
around
the
edges
of
fields
wait
for
rats
mice
moles
rabbits
gophers
beetles
cutworms
and
many
other
creatures
which
destroy
vegetable
life
the
wise
watchers
kill
these
hurtful
creatures
and
so
become
the
guardians
of
the
fields
oh
do
tell
us
which
ones
do
this
and
which
took
rap
chickens
said
dodo
forgetting
her
disappointment
for
the
time
i
am
going
to
make
a
play
for
you
some
of
the
owls
and
hawks
shall
speak
for
themselves
and
tell
you
about
their
own
habits
and
customs
in
fact
the
most
familiar
of
these
cannibals
shall
have
a
hearing
this
morning
in
the
wonder
room
the
american
eagle
is
to
be
the
judge
and
i
think
that
as
you
can
not
go
to
the
woods
you
will
like
to
come
into
my
room
to
hear
what
they
have
to
say
birds
talking
about
themselves
in
the
wonder
room
said
dodo
in
a
puzzled
way
what
is
a
hearing
asked
nat
i
know
what
a
hearing
is
said
rap
it
is
where
people
are
accused
of
doing
something
wrong
and
they
go
down
to
the
courthouse
and
the
judge
hears
what
they
have
to
say
about
it
and
if
he
thinks
they
have
done
the
things
he
binds
them
over
for
trial
they
often
have
hearings
down
in
the
town
hall
in
the
east
village
you
are
quite
right
my
boy
and
at
this
hearing
of
ours
as
the
birds
are
stuffed
and
can
not
speak
i
shall
speak
for
them
even
if
they
could
talk
we
could
not
understand
them
unless
we
borrowed
magic
spectacles
now
if
you
will
come
into
the
study
you
will
find
them
all
ready
the
children
did
not
wait
to
be
asked
twice
nat
and
dodo
rushed
along
the
hall
followed
by
rap
in
the
study
two
tables
were
put
together
making
a
sort
of
platform
at
the
end
of
the
room
on
this
platform
a
dozen
stuffed
birds
sat
in
solemn
silence
the
owls
were
on
one
side
with
a
row
of
hawks
facing
them
on
the
other
a
big
golden
eagle
was
at
the
foot
and
a
american
eagle
held
the
place
of
honor
at
the
head
on
a
pile
of
books
each
bird
was
mounted
on
a
wooden
perch
and
as
they
were
all
set
up
in
very
natural
positions
the
effect
was
quite
startling
to
the
children
illustration
golden
eagle
where
did
all
these
big
birds
come
from
asked
nat
they
were
not
in
the
glass
cases

the
american
eagle
makes
the
first
speech
which
i
will
translate
to
you
the
eagle
looked
very
fierce
as
he
sat
there
his
head
neck
and
tail
were
white
but
the
rest
of
his
body
was
dark
brown
the
upper
part
of
his
great
yellow
beak
was
hooked
his
yellow
feet
were
bare
and
scaly
and
his
four
sharp
claws
or
talons
as
they
are
often
called
were
black
he
was
nearly
three
feet
tall
and
if
he
had
spread
his
powerful
wings
he
would
have
measured
seven
feet
from
tip
to
tip
the
golden
eagle
who
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
table
was
about
the
same
size
and
an
equally
handsome
bird
he
held
his
head
proudly
erect
and
his
black
wings
folded
tightly
he
too
had
some
white
feathers
in
the
tail
though
none
on
the
head
his
hooked
beak
was
black
and
he
wore
dark
leggings
almost
down
to
his
powerful
claws
these
two
eagles
though
not
exactly
friends
are
not
enemies
for
the
one
ranges
over
all
of
north
america
especially
in
open
places
near
the
water
while
his
golden
brother
keeps
more
to
the
western
parts
and
loves
the
loneliness
of
cold
northern
mountains
we
birds
of
prey
said
the
eagle
who
bow
to
no
one
and
even
sleep
sitting
erect
we
whose
females
are
larger
than
the
males
for
the
better
protection
of
our
nests
are
accused
of
eating
not
only
our
smaller
brethren
but
also
animals
which
are
of
service

deny
that
we
do
this

screech

there
were
two
screech
owls
perched
side
by
side
on
one
stump
they
were
not
ten
inches
long
and
had
feathery
standing
up
like
horns
an
inch
long
one
owl
was
mottled
gray
and
black
the
other
was
and
the
toes
of
both
peeped
out
of
holes
in
their
thin
stockings
the
gray
one
gave
a
little
quavering
wail
and
said
i
am
everywhere
a
owl
though
i
say
it
myself
i
am
a
good
citizen
and
in
this
the
wise
men
agree
my
family
are
also
distinguished
by
two
other
odd
habits
having
two
sets
of
eyelids
an
inner
and
an
outer
we
can
close
one
or
both
at
will
the
inner
one
is
a
thin
skin
that
we
blink
with
and
draw
across
our
eyes
in
the
when
the
light
annoys
us
just
as
house
people
pull
down
a
curtain
to
shut
out
the
sun
the
outer
lids
we
close
only
in
sleep
when
we
put
up
the
shutters
after
a
night
work
and
at
last
in
death
for
birds
alone
among
all
animals
are
able
to
close
their
own
eyes
when
they
die
the
other
habit
is
the
trick
of
turning
our
heads
entirely
round
from
front
to
back
without
wringing
our
necks
or
choking
to
death
this
we
do
to
enable
us
to
see
in
every
direction
as
we
can
not
roll
our
eyes
about
as
freely
as
most
birds
do
come
to
think
of
it
i
am
very
fond
of
eating
one
bird
that
so
the
wise
men
say
is
as
bad
as
a
mouse
for
mischief

eat
english
sparrows

wish
the
wise

would
tell
me
why
am

a
moment

as
if

himself
doubted

the

owl
fiercely
but
i
am
not
afraid
of
anything
or
anybody
i
am
a
liberal
parent
and
heap
my

up
with

i
wish

i
am
very
dainty

any
one
is
welcome
to

i
leave
i
also
like

but
i
eat
rabbits

enough
too

warrant
you
i
could
give
you
a
long
list
of
the
rodents
i
kill
in

i
wo
for
you
might

is
always
an

the

how
to
use
both
beak

claws
bound
over

trial
said
the
eagle
and
you
are
lucky
not
to
be
committed

contempt

nineteen
inches
in

long

glance
he
seemed
to
be
a
bird
but
on
close
inspection
one
could
see
that
his
under
parts
were
white
mottled
with
brown
and
there
was
also
a
large
white
patch
on
his
rump
he
spoke
very
clearly
and
said
i
roam
all
over
north
america
wherever
there
is
open
country
and
free
flying
and
make
my

not

after
the

spent
some
time
in
looking
at
the
hawks

nat
asked
what
are
the
birds
uncle
that
those
cannibals
sometimes
eat
that
is
not
an
easy
question
to
answer
my
boy
but
as
we
are
coming
to
these
birds
next
you
will
learn
about
them
separately
game
birds
as
a
whole
are
those
chiefly
useful
as
food
and
the
hunting
of
them
is
the
occupation
of
sportsmen
these
birds
may
belong
to
the
working
guilds
and
all
have
habits
interesting
to
but
as
regards
their
value
to
the
world
it
is
mostly
in
the
shape
of
food
for
house
people
then
it
is
wrong
for
people
to
kill
these
birds
for
food
no
not
if
it
is
done
fairly
in
a
true
sportsmanlike
spirit
and
not
with
traps
or
snares
or
in
the
nesting
season
when
no
bird
should
be
molested
the
true
sportsman
never
shoots
a
bird
out
of
season
or
a
song
bird
at
any
time
and
it
is
owing
to
his
care
that
laws
are
made
to
stop
the
are
the
game
birds
tree
birds
or
what
asked
dodo
there
are
many
kinds
said
the
doctor
some
of
them
have
cooing
notes
and
build
their
nests
in
trees
these
belong
to
the
pigeon
family
some
scratch
about
and
feed
on
the
ground
where
they
also
nest
like
our
barnyard
poultry
others
run
along
the
banks
of
rivers
or
on
the
where
they
wade
in
shallow
water
to
pick
up
their
food
like
snipes
and
plovers
while
others
swim
with
their
webbed
feet
and
take
their
food
from
deep
water
like
geese
and
ducks

are
a
few
game
birds
in
this
glass
case
some
pigeons
and
grouse
suppose
we
finish
the
morning
in
their
company
we
will
call
pigeons
the
birds
that
coo
and
grouse
are
some
of
the
birds
that
scratch
so
called
because
they
all
have
much
the
same
habit
as
our
domestic
fowls
of
scratching
the
ground
for
food
and
to
raise
a
dust
in
which
they
take
a
sort
of
bath

this
cooer
is
called
the
passenger

chapter
xxvi
a
cooing
pair
the
passenger
pigeon
and
the
mourning
dove
you
all
know
the
pigeons
that
are
kept
about
stables
and
barnyards
you
have
often
seen
them
walking
with
dainty
steps
to
pick
up
their
food
and
have
heard
the
soft
crooning
they
give
when
talking
to
each
other
they
all
belong
to
the
birds
that
coo
their
food
is
taken
into
the
crop
which
can
be
plainly
seen
when
it
is
quite
full
these
birds
feed
their
young
in
the
same
way
hummingbirds
and
flickers
do
for
they
give
the
little
ones
softened
food
from
the
crop
mixed
with
a
sort
of
milky
fluid
that
also
comes
from
the
crop
one
habit
that
pigeons
and
doves
have
all
their
own
is
that
in
drinking
they
do
not
raise
the
head
to
swallow
like
other
birds
but
keep
the
beak
in
the
water
until
they
are
through
our
domestic
pigeons
have
beautiful
and
varied
plumage
but
to
my
mind
many
wild
species
surpass
them
the
two
wild
species
are
the
passenger
pigeon
of
the
northwest
and
the
mourning
dove
which
may
be
found
nesting
everywhere
in
temperate
north
america
here
are
the
two
birds
and
the
doctor
set
them
upon
the
table
at
first
glance
you
may
think
them
much
alike
and
if
you
should
see
them
on
the
wing
you
would
surely
be
confused
rap
you
may
describe
the
passenger
pigeon
and
nat
shall
take
the

me
see
if
you
can
do
it
clearly
enough
for
your
written
tables

passenger
pigeon
rap
looked
at
the
pigeon
for
some
time
it
is
an
easy
bird
to
describe
all
the
colors
run
together
so
it
has
upper
parts
and
underneath
it
is
a
sort
of
pinky
brown

white

the

of
the

my
boy
how
long
do
you
think
it
is
rap
measured
with
his
finger
and
said
he
thought
about
fourteen
inches
you
are
almost
right
though
these
pigeons
vary
in
length
because
some
have
longer
tails
than
others
i
think
this
one
measured
about
sixteen
inches
when
it
was
stretched
out
straight
but
it
looks
shorter
now
because
it
is
set
up
in
a
natural
position
the
life
history
of
this
beautiful
pigeon
should
teach
every
one
the
necessity
of
protecting
birds
by
law
up
to
fifty
years
ago
the
passenger
pigeon
was
extremely
plentiful
everywhere
east
of
the
great
plains
there
were
many
millions
in
a
single
flock
sometimes
it
was
a
most
valuable
bird
its
flesh
being
particularly
and
tender
it
nested
in
large
colonies
that
often
stretched
unbroken
for
many
miles
in
the
woods
and
was
both
hardy
and
prolific
if
it
had
been
protected
in
the
breeding
season
and
hunted
fairly
as
an
article
of
food
at
other
times
we
should
still
be
enjoying
pigeon
pie
as
freely
as
we
did
in
my
boyhood
but
as
the
population
of
the
country
increased
these
great
flocks
were
cruelly
slaughtered
for
the
mere
greed
of
killing
them
thousands
were
often
left
to
decay
upon
the
ground
and
now
i
do
not
believe
that
any
one
of
you
has
ever
seen
a
wild
pigeon
before
we
have
pigeon
pie
at
home
in
the
winter
said
dodo
yes
tame
pigeon
pie
said
the
doctor
it
might
have
been
tame
pie
and
it
was
very
good
but
uncle
roy
why
did
people
want
to
kill
these
good
food
birds
when
they
did
care
to
eat
them
it
is
difficult
to
say
exactly
little
girl
people
living
in
what
we
call
a
state
of
nature
like
african
savages
or
as
our
american
indians
once
did
seem
to
follow
heart
of
nature
law
what
ye
need
for
food
but
many
people
that
are
called
civilized
never
think
of
natural
law
at
all
and
having
a
coarse
streak
in
their
natures
desire
to
kill
wild
things
merely
for
the
sake
of
killing
it
is
against
such
people
that
laws
must
be
made
by
those
who
have
more
intelligence

it
looked
sort

but
near

it
is
and
gray
on

its
head

have
bright
colors
like
what
you

has
not

for
some
time

you
that
is
what
i
was
trying
to
say
it
is
just
like
what
rap
called

on
the

but
this
dove
has
got
black
specks
like
velvet
on
the
neck
too
and
a
black
band
on
the
tail
with
white
tips
to
the
feathers
underneath
it
is
dull
purple
and
sort
of
buff
and
its
feet
are
red

it
about
a
foot
long

is
a
fairly
good
description
of
a
bird
whose
colors
it
is
almost
impossible
to
put
into
words
do
you
know
anything
about
this
dove
rap
i
only
know
it
builds
such
a
poor
nest
that
you
would
think
the
eggs
would
drop
through
the
bottom
only
they
do
seem
to
there
was
a
nest
in
the
miller
woods
last
year
with
two
white
eggs
like
tame
pigeons
only
smaller
and
when
they
hatched
i
took
one
of
the
squabs
home
for
a
pet
it
became
very
tame
but
i
had
to
let
it
fly
because
it
grew
too
big
and
dirty
it
was
like
keeping
a
chicken
in
the
house
the
miller
said
they
were
mischievous
birds
and
ate
so
many
oats
that
he
had
to
sow
his
field
twice
over

that
true
doctor
or
do
they
belong
to
some
good
guild
they
do
not
eat
insects
though
they
may
do
a
little
work
as
weed
warriors
and
as
they
are
fond
of
grain
they
may
have
helped
themselves
to
some
of
the
miller
oats
but
usually
when
they
feed
on
the
ground
they
are
gleaners
and
they
never
disturb
grain
in
the
ear
they
have
many
pretty
ways
and
even
though
their
is
sad
they
are
cheerful
and
happy
their
sounds
very
gentle
in
the
morning
chorus
and
though
the
dove
often
nests
in
open
woods
and
gardens
it
seems
most
at
home
in
a
quiet
place
near
water
for
it
is
very
fond
of
drinking
and
bathing

three
famous
game
birds
if
any
one
should
ask
you
which
are
the
most
famous
american
game
birds
you
may
answer
without
hesitation
white
ruffed
grouse
and
woodcock
the
whistler
the
drummer
and
the
sky
dancer
all
three
good
citizens
and
handsome
interesting
birds
bob
white
is
the
most
familiar
because
in
spring
when
he
feels
quite
sure
that
the
law
will
protect
his
pretty
head
he
comes
out
of
the
thick
bushes
to
the
rail
fence
by
the
roadside
and
calls
his
own
name
white
bob
white
so
that
the
shy
mate
he
desires
shall
know
where
to
find
him
then
if
she
is
and
a
long
time
coming
he
will
say
as
if
craving
for
pity
the
last
of
may
the
nesting
begins
and
from
then
until
autumn
bob
white
tells
his
name
and
whereabouts
to
no
one
for
it
is
a
very
busy
season
with
him
the
nest
of
leaves
on
the
ground
may
yield
during
the
summer
twenty
or
thirty
little
bobs
whom
he
must
help
supply
with
food
and
teach
to
walk
about
and
care
for
themselves
in
autumn
each
one
of
these
quail
families

from

sportsman
and
only

from
shelter

nosed
out
by
his
dog
illustration
bob
white
the
ruffed
grouse
is
also
a
bird
of
woods
and
brushy
places
but
at
all
seasons
is
more
fond
of
trees
than
bob
white
it
is
much
larger
than
bob
and
if
seen
among
the
underbrush
looks
like
a
small
brown
speckled
hen
watch
one
in
the
when
he
is
roaming
the
woods
in
search
of
a
mate
and
you
will
see
that
he
is
every
inch
a
game
bird
a
king
of
game
birds
too
in
early
may
this
grouse
mounts
a
fallen
tree
or
the
rail
of
an
old
fence
and
swells
his
breast
proudly
till
the
long
feathers
on
each
side
of
his
neck
rise
into
a
beautiful
shining
black
ruffle
or
tippet
such
as
you
can
see
in
some
portraits
of
the
times
when
elizabeth
was
queen
of
england
he
droops
his
wings
and
spreads
his
tail
to
a
brown
and
gray
banded
fan
which
he
holds
straight
up
as
a
turkey
does
his
when
he
is
strutting
and
gobbling
next
he
raises
his
wings
and
begins
to
beat
the
air
slowly
at
first
and
then
faster
and
faster
boom
boom
the
hollow
sound
comes
rolling
with
a
noise
like
beating
a
bass
drum
thus
does
the
ruffed
grouse
drum
up
his
mate
as
the
woodpecker
hammers
or
the
thrush
sings
you
remember
the
booming
sound
made
by
the
wings
of
the
nighthawk
when
the
air
whizzed
through
them
when
bob
white
and
his
grouse
brother
fly
their
wings
make
a
whirring
noise
that
is
equally
startling
and
does
his
mate
understand
that
the
drumming
is
meant
to
call
her
yes
surely
and
soon
there
is
a
nest
of
dry
leaves
somewhere
about
the
roots
of
a
tree
or
under
a
fallen
log
father
grouse
then
becomes
selfish
and
takes
himself
off
with
some
men
friends
leaving
mamma
alone
to
hatch
the
eggs
and
feed
the
babies
but
this
is
not
so
dreadful
as
it
seems
because
the
young
ones
are
fully
covered
with
down
like
chickens
when
they
first
leave
the
egg
and
able
to
follow
their
mother
besides
they
are
the
most
obedient
little
things
imaginable
if
she
but
gives
one
cluck
of
alarm
they
vanish
under
the
leaves
or
twigs
and
do
not
stir
again
until
they
hear
her
say
the
danger
is
over
and
that
patient
watchful
mother
grouse
has
as
many
ways
of
leading
an
enemy
away
from
her
nest
as
any
house
mother
could
devise
if
her
children
were
in
danger
this
grouse
is
a
ground
gleaner
a
seed

a
weed

sometimes
he
burrows
in

for
shelter
from

cold
and
then
is
liable
to
be

by
a
sleet
storm
and
frozen

you
see
his
life
is
not
altogether
an
easy
one

and
grub
eater
who
by
the
aid
of
his
long
straight
bill
which
has
a
sensitive
tip
like
your
finger
can
feel
his
food
when
it
is
out
of
sight
and
is
able
to
probe
the
soft
mud
for
things
to
eat
that
other
birds
can
not
find
the
strangest
thing
about
his
bill
is
that
the
upper
half
of
it
can
be
bent
at
the
end
almost
as
much
as
you
can
crook
the
last
joint
of
your
fingers
such
a
bill
is
of
the
greatest
assistance
to
him
as
his
eyes
are
set
so
far
in
the
back
of
his
head
that
he
can
not
see
what
he
eats
how
queer
said
nat
what
is
the
reason
for
that
i
suppose
there
must
be
a
reason
this
is
it
by
being
placed
far
back
in
his
head
his
eyes
become
like
two
from
which
he
can
scan
the
country
behind
as
well
as
in
front
and
be
on
the
alert
for
enemies
woodcocks
are
very
cautious
birds
keeping
well
hidden
by
day
and
feeding
only
during
the
twilight
hours
or
at
night
they
do
not
pass
the
winter
in
the
colder
parts
of
the
country
and
so
escape
the
suffering
that
often
overtakes
bob
white
and
the
ruffed
grouse
they
must
be
able
to
brave
snowstorms
however
at
the
latter
end
of
the
cold
season
for
sometimes
when
they
begin
to
lay
in
early
april
winter
changes
its
mind
and
comes
back
to
give
them
a
snow
blanket
you
said
that
they
are
dancing
birds
said
dodo
when
do
they
dance
they
dance
in
the
sky
in
spring
and
summer
cried
rap
unable
to
keep
still
any
longer
i
saw
a
pair
of
them
doing
it
this
year
when
i
was
out
with
the
miller
looking
for
his
colt
that
had
strayed
into
the
big
woods
beyond
the
pond
he
said
he
knew
there
must
be
a
woodcock
about
because
he
saw
the
little
round
holes
in
the
mud
where
they
had
been
boring
for
earthworms
and
that
is
the
way
he
knows
where
to
find
them
in
the
fall
when
he
wants
to
go
hunting
yes
but
how
did
they
dance

oh
like
crazy
things
with
wings
first
one
ran
around
a
little
and
whistled
then
one
jumped
right
off
into
the
air
making
a
whirring
with
his
wings
until
he
was
way
up
out
of
sight
and
then
after
a
little
while
he
came
pitching
down
like
a
kite
that
has
lost
its
tail
whistling
something
like
the
way
a
swallow
twitters
and
making
a
queer
twanging
noise
the

stayed
on

chapter
xxviii
on
the
shore
by
the
first
of
august
bird
housekeeping
was
over
at
orchard
farm
the
barn
swallow
had
guided
her
last
brood
through
the
hayloft
window
without
having
it
closed
upon
her
as
she
had
feared
the
friendly
robins
had
left
the
orchard
and
lawn
to
moult
in
the
quiet
of
the
woods
the
thrashers
and
catbirds
too
were
quite
silent
and
invisible
of
all
the
voices
that
had
made
the
last
three
months
so
musical
the
vireo
and
the
song
sparrow
alone
persisted
in
singing
aided
by
a
few
wood
thrushes
rap
says
that
august
is
a
poor
month
for
birds
about
here
said
nat
to
his
uncle
do
you
think
there
will
be
more
of
them
down
at
the
shore
that
we
can
not
tell
until
we
go
there
but
we
are
likely
to
meet
some
of
the
wading
and
swimming
birds
who
have
nested
in
the
far
north
and
are
on
their
southward
journey
if
the
weather
is
pleasant
they
often
pass
by
far
out
at
sea
but
if
it
is
foggy
or
stormy
they
may
stop
awhile
to
rest
and
feed
do
many
of
these
birds
nest
near
our
beach
a
few
but
the
greater
number
breed
further
north
olaf
will
show
us
herons
in
the
island
woods
and
where
the
rails
nest
in
the
reeds
near
the
marsh
wrens
a
mile
or
two
up
the
river
some
day
when
it
is
calm
we
will
sail
over
to
great
gull
island
where
many
water
birds
lay
their
eggs
on
the
bare
sand
there
will
be
enough
for
you
to
see
and
do
i
promise
you
the
next
day
they
all
went
to
the
shore
wolf
looked
after
them
very
sadly
from
the
door
of
his
kennel
where
he
was
chained
and
barked
a
gruff
goodbye
but
quick
informed
them
that
he
intended
going
also
took
matters
into
his
own
hands
and
started
to
run
down
the
road
ahead
of
the
wagon
after
much
arranging
talking
and
laughing
two
of
people
rubber
boots
fishing
tackle
and
other
things
started
toward
the
shore
a
farm
hand
going
with
each
team
to
drive
the
horses
back
miss
olive
honey
called
mammy
bun
as
they
were
starting
don
you
let
de
chillen
eat
too
many
o
dem
clams
what
has
de
long
necks
dey
is
powerful
full
o
cramps
and
olive
promised
that
she
would
be
very
careful
when
they
reached
the
shore
they
found
everything
ready
for
them
olaf
little
home
which
contained
four
tiny
rooms
was
as
clean
and
compact
as
a
ship
cabin
there
was
a
kitchen
one
room
for
olive
and
dodo
one
for
the
doctor
and
another
for
rap
mother
while
olaf
nat
and
rap
were
to
sleep
close
by
in
a
tent
made
of
poles
canvas
and
pine
boughs
several
boats
were
drawn
up
on
the
beach
by
a
creel
of
nets
and
some
lobster
pots
while
olaf
sharpie
was
anchored
in
deep
water
a
little
way
offshore
it
was
late
when
the
horses
turned
homeward
after
leaving
their
loads
it
had
been
a
beautiful
afternoon
neither
too
warm
nor
too
cool
oh
exclaimed
dodo
now
that
the
horses
have
gone
the
good
time
will
begin
for
we
ca
go
back
even
if
we
want
to
the
children
amused
themselves
for
some
time
in
looking
at
their
new
quarters
and
then
in
watching
olaf
row
out
to
light
the
beacon
lamps
when
it
grew
dusk
they
had
supper
wondering
at
the
strange
stillness
of
the
evening
for
though
it
was
usually
very
quiet
at
the
farm
they
had
never
before
known
the
silence
that
falls
with
the
twilight
on
a
shore
where
the
water
does
not
rush
and
beat
as
on
the
ocean
beaches
but
simply
laps
lazily
to
and
fro
like
the
swinging
of
a
hammock
presently
the
stars
began
to
give
winks
at
the
beacons
first
one
then
another
and
another
until
the
whole
sky
twinkled
while
one
evening
star
the
brightest
of
them
all
hurried
along
the
west
as
if
it
were
trying
to
overtake
the
sun
and
knew
that
it
was
fully
half
an
hour
behind
the
jolly
god
of
day
see
how
the
tide
is
coming
in
said
rap
when
they
returned
to
the
beach
when
olaf
went
out
he
had
to
push
his
boat
ever
so
far
and
now
the
water
is
almost
up
to
the
line
of
seaweeds
and
shells
i
wonder
what
makes
the
water
go
in
and
out
questioned
dodo
half
to
herself
i
do
exactly
know
said
rap
but
i
think
it
is
because
the
earth
goes
round
every
day
making
the
water
tip
from
one
side
to
the
other
and
then
back
again
then
why
does
it
all
tip
off
into
the
sky
persisted
dodo
i
guess
because
that
is
i
do
know
stammered
rap
i
must
ask
uncle
roy
to
tell
us
and
why
the
earth
down
here
on
the
shore
stays
sharp
and
gritty
when
it
is
wet
for
when
the
earth
up
at
the
farm
is
wet
it
makes
sticky
mud
said
dodo
yes
said
nat
and
why
the
stars
are
of
such
different
sizes
and
seem
to
stay
quite
still
except
some
that
go
along
like
that
big
bright
one
over
there
quok
quok
cried
a
strange
voice
from
the
marshes
back
of
the
beach
quok
quok
quok
quok
answered
other
voices
what
can
that
be
said
nat
it
is
a
or
a
nighthawk
it
must
be
one
of
the
cannibal
birds
uncle
roy
what
kind
of
birds
are
those
calling
away
over
in
the
marshes
but
the
doctor
was
not
within
hearing
and
it
was
some
time
before
they
found
him
sitting
by
the
cabin
door
smoking
his
pet
outdoor
pipe
which
was
made
of
a
did
you
hear
the
night
herons
calling
as
you
came
up
he
asked
we
heard
a
very
queer
squawky
sound
and
came
to
ask
you
what
it
was
for
we
could
guess
said
nat
what
is
a
night
heron
a
cousin
of
the
nighthawk
who
lives
near
the
water
i
do
think
it
a
water
bird
said
rap
because
i
have
heard
that
same
squawking
up
by
the
mill
but
is
not
the
mill
close
to
the
pond
said
the
doctor
smiling
why
yes
to
be
sure
but
i
was
thinking
of
salt
water
that
is
a
distinction
that
applies
to
few
of
our
water
birds
when
we
speak
of
the
birds
that
wade
paddle
swim
and
dive
we
must
remember
that
they
may
do
so
in
lakes
rivers
bays
or
the
ocean
according
to
their
individual
habits
in
fact
some
members
of
a
single
family
prefer
fresh
water
while
their
brothers
are
more
fond
of
the
salt
sea
this
is
the
case
in
the
family
of
the
night
heron
where
does
he
belong
asked
rap
with
the
paddling
birds
or
the
swimming
ones
with
the
paddlers
and
waders
see
here
comes
the
moon
up
out
of
the
water
and
it
makes
a
shiny
path
up
to
our
feet
and
olaf
is
rowing
back
right
down
it
and
the
stars
have
stopped
winking
and
are
getting
dim
said
eager
little
dodo
with
an
and
wherever
she
ought
to
have
stopped
to
breathe
as
usual
hark
the
herons
are
squawking
again
wo
you
tell
us
about
them
now
uncle
roy
a
family
illustration
night
heron
the
heron
family
to
which
these
squawkers
belong
contains
many
birds
they
are
not
exactly
what
we
call
shore
birds
but
live
contentedly
near
any
water
where
they
can
wade
and
splash
about
pools
and
shallows
for
their
food
for
they
eat
meat
though
they
never
kill
birds
like
the
cannibals
their
taste
is
for
frogs
lizards
snakes
snails
crabs
fish
and
other
small
fry
they
very
seldom
eat
any
animals
herons
are
all
rather
large
birds
the
smallest
of
them
being
over
a
foot
in
length
while
the
largest
stand
fully
four
feet
high
quok
quok
came
the
cry
again
this
time
just
over
the
cabin
looking
up
the
children
saw
a
dark
body
flying
toward
the
wood
belt
something
like
a
long
beak
stuck
out
from
its
breast
in
front
and
its
long
legs
were
stretched
out
stiff
behind
but
these
were
the
only
details
that
they
could
distinguish
i
thought
herons
had
long
necks
said
nat
but
this
one
does
seem
to
have
any
neck
at
all
ah
but
when
it
flies
it
folds
its
long
neck
and
thus
draws
its
head
down
between
its
shoulders
while
some
of
the
stork
and
crane
cousins
poke
out
their
heads
in
flying
are
storks
and
cranes
cousins
of
the
herons
asked
dodo
i
know
about
storks
they
are
in
my
fairy
book
they
live
in
the
north
country
where
little
tuk
came
from
and
build
their
nests
on
roofs
between
chimneys
and
stand
a
great
deal
on
one
leg
in
the
water
looking
for
frogs
do
herons
nest
on
roofs
and
stand
on
one
leg
uncle
roy
they
do
not
nest
on
roofs
but
they
often
stand
on
one
leg
when
watching
for
food
and
when
sleeping
in
fact
they
stand
so
much
in
this
way
that
one
leg
is
often
stronger
than
the
other
and
they
most
certainly
belong
to
the
guild
of
wise
watchers
the
night
heron
who
has
just
flown
over
is
the
most
familiar
member
of
his
family
hereabouts
and
quite
a
sociable
bird
he
prefers
to
live
the
hotel
life
of
a
colony
instead
of
having
a
quiet
home
of
his
own
and
so
do
almost
all
other
members
of
the
heron
family
these
night
herons
flock
back
from
warm
countries
in
april
and
by
early
may
have
built
their
rough
nests
of
sticks
in
trees
near
the
water
or
over
a
marshy
place
there
is
a
colony
of
twenty
or
thirty
nests
on
marsh
island
olaf
tells
me
in
my
boyhood
days
there
used
to
be
hundreds
of
them
in
a
heronry
as
such
a
colony
is
called
is
a
very
noisy
dirty
place
for
they
do
not
keep
their
homes
neat
and
nice
like
the
tidy
land
birds
and
night
heron
call
hoarsely
enough
to
each
other
but
imagine
three
or
four
baby
herons
crying
from
every
nest
truly
the
parents
can
have
but
little
rest
for
day
and
night
they
must
go
frogging
or
fishing
to
fill
the
stomachs
of
their
awkward
children
when
the
nesting
season
is
over
however
this
heron
again
becomes
the
night
watchman
of
the
marshes
the
tinkling
of
the
bell
on
the
cow
is
his
breakfast
bell
and
sunset
the
signal
for
him
to
leave
his
roost
then
beware
little
fishes
and
lizards
those
red
eyes
are
glowing
for
you
that
long
beak
is
ready
to
stab
you
to
death
froggy
would
go
return
quickly
to
your
mother
without
making
any
impertinent
remarks
about
and
spinach
on
the
way
or
something
much
more
savage
than
the
duck
will
surely
gobble
you
up
stay
in
doors
patiently
until
sunrise
sends
the
prowler
back
to
his
heronry
again
may
we
go
to
see
the
herons
some
day
it
would
be
so
funny
to
go
to
a
bird
hotel
and
find
everybody
asleep
like
the
beauty
in
the
wood
said
dodo
you
shall
certainly
pay
them
a
visit
but
i
doubt
that
you
will
find
them
as
sound
asleep
as
you
imagine
the
very
next
morning
olaf
piloted
the
party
across
the
meadows
to
the
wood
that
was
made
an
island
by
a
little
creek
that
threaded
in
and
out
among
the
reeds
i
know
somebody
whose
feet
are
wet
already
said
nat
pointing
to
olive
who
was
slipping
about
uncertainly
i
know
it
was
very
foolish
to
come
without
my
rubber
boots
but
they
are
so
uncomfortable
to
wear
in
summer
oh
please
give
me
your
hand
quick
father
the
doctor
caught
her
as
she
was
sinking
in
what
looked
like
a
bit
of
good
ground
but
was
really
a
bog
tuft
it
took
some
time
to
work
their
way
to
the
centre
of
the
island
there
the
ground
was
drier
in
spots
between
the
little
pools
and
there
were
some
high
trees
stop
here
said
olaf
cautiously
and
look
well
before
they
did
so
just
as
the
crackling
twigs
startled
some
dusky
shapes
that
flapped
among
the
trees
the
herons
exclaimed
rap
settling
his
crutch
more
firmly
and
preparing
to
watch
closely
as
soon
as
their
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
dim
light
the
party
saw
many
large
birds
some
in
the
trees
some
in
the
decaying
underbrush
and
others
on
the
ground
here
and
there
among
the
trees
were
nests
looking
like
flat
heaps
of
sticks
they
were
empty
but
their
sides
the
trees
and
the
ground
were
all
spattered
and
befouled
with
the
droppings
of
the
careless
colony
ugh
shivered
dodo
who
had
a
very
keen
nose
what
an
ugly
place
to
live
in
and
such
a
horrid
smell
please
uncle
do
these
birds
have
dreadful
headaches
very
often
i
think
house
people
would
have
wretched
headaches
if
they
lived
here
in
fact
we
must
not
stay
very
long
but
it
agrees
with
herons
who
are
built
to
be
the
wardens
of
just
such
places
there
are
two
kinds
of
herons
here
said
rap
some
black
and
white
with
a
topknot
and
some
striped
brown
ones
are
the
brown
ones
bitterns
they
look
like
one
i
saw
in
the
miller
woods
and
he
called
it
a
bittern
the
striped
ones
are
the
young
birds
now
wearing
their
first
plumage
bitterns
prefer
to
live
in
freshwater
meadows
or
near
ponds
they
are
solitary
birds
keeping
house
in
single
pairs
and
after
wander
about
entirely
alone
is
it
very
hard
to
tell
young
night
herons
from
bitterns
asked
nat
it
would
be
easy
for
you
to
mistake
them
but
the
habits
of
the
two
species
are
quite
different
the
bittern
nests
on
the
ground
in
a
reedy
bog
not
in
the
woods
and
may
be
seen
flying
in
broad
daylight
with
his
long
legs
trailing
behind
him
but
in
spite
of
this
he
is
a
difficult
bird
to
find
for
if
anything
is
unfriendly
solitary
slow
it
is
the
american
bittern
who
often
stands
motionless
among
the
reeds
for
hours
that
is
just
what
the
bittern
did
that
the
miller
and
i
saw
said
rap
we
were
hunting
for
a
calf
the
miller
things
are
always
straying
away
because
he
never
mends
his
fences
and
this
bittern
was
among
some
very
tall
grasses
and
dry
flags
for
it
was
along
in
the
fall
when
things
were
turning
brown
i
do
know
how
i
ever
came
to
see
him
but
when
i
did
he
looked
so
queer
that
he
almost
scared
me
and
i
said
to
the
miller
is
that
illustration
american
bittern
for
a
minute
he
could
see
anything
and
then
he
said
only
a
bittern
but
i
do
wish
i
had
my
gun
does
he
move
said
i
at
the
way
he
holds
his
head
straight
up
like
a
stick
i
going
round
behind
him
to
see
what
his
back
looks
like
a
stupid
thing
and
thinks
we
do
see
him
said
the
miller
i
walked
round
and
round
until
i
began
to
get
dizzy
but
that
bird
was
all
front
and
all
i
could
see
was
his
striped
breast
and
neck
then
i
saw
the
miller
was
laughing
bird
is
as
stupid
as
he
looks
said
he
turns
around
just
as
fast
as
you
walk
so
you
wo
have
a
chance
to
get
behind
him
then
we
heard
the
calf
low
and
we
went
away
that
was
a
sight
worth
seeing
my
boy
said
the
doctor
for
it
is
one
of
the
best
proofs
that
birds
understand
the
value
of
protection
of
color
the
bittern
and
the
old
reeds
blended
their
colors
together
and
by
stretching
up
its
neck
the
bird
adapted
his
shape
as
much
as
possible
to
the
straight
stiff
lines
of
the
reeds
while
by
keeping
his
front
parts
toward
you
the
curves
of
his
back
were
concealed
you
might
have
passed
his
a
hundred
times
without
seeing
him
but
come
let
us
leave
this
heron
hotel
and
find
a
way
to
the
lane
road
the
open
air
seemed
doubly
sweet

fishy
smell

is
oftener
heard
than
seen
in
the
bogs
where
he
likes
to
live
alone

makes
a
loud
noise
that
sounds
like
chopping
wood
with
an
axe
or
driving
a
stake
in
the
ground
with
a
mallet
so
he
is
called
the
by
some
people
while
others
name
him
and
his
body
is
about
as
big
as
a
hen
and
he
is
sometimes
known
as

you

who

asked
dodo

she
had
finished
writing

had
buttoned
her
book
into
the
pocket
of
the
long
gray
linen

the

had
taught
both
olive
and
herself
to
wear

they
hunted

butterflies
boys
have

how
i
wish
i
was
a
boy
dodo
had
said
after
she
had
been
at
orchard
farm
a
couple
of
days
so
do
i
had
echoed
olive
there
is
always
something
to
carry
and
everything
seems
either
to
fall
out
of
girls
pockets
or
to
be
smashed
flat
if
you
will
only
promise
not
to
turn
into
boys
i
will
furnish
you
with
pockets
the
doctor
had
said
and
he
had
kept
his
word
as
usual
illustration
snowy
egret
or
bonnet
martyr
did
i
say
four
herons
he
now
asked
yes
to
be
sure
there
are
two
more
that
will
interest
you
the
snowy
egret
or
bonnet
martyr
and
the
great
blue
heron
or
blue
giant
bonnet
martyr
what
a
strange
name
for
a
bird
why
do
you
call
him
that
do
they
live
about
here
asked
nat
they
do
not
live
so
far
north
as
this
though
they
sometimes
stray
through
the
middle
and
northern
states
but
in
the
southern
states
and
florida
in
particular
they
used
to
live
in
vast
colonies
now
they
are
being
surely
and
quickly
put
out
of
the
world
by
the
cruelty
and
thoughtlessness
of
house
people
the
particular
kind
of
house
people
who
wear
women
hats
and
bonnets
once
these
egrets
covered
the
southern
lowlands
like
drifting
snow
for
they
are
beautifully
white
in
the
nesting
season
when
many
birds
are
allowed
some
special
attraction
in
the
way
of
plumage
bunches
of
long
slender
graceful
plumes
grow
on
their
backs
between
the
shoulders
and
curl
up
over
the
tail
in
an
evil
moment
some
woman
imitating
the
savages
used
a
bunch
of
these
feathers
to
make
a
tuft
upon
her
headgear
from
that
day
the
spotless
bird
was
doomed
to
martyrdom
egrets
as
the
plumes
are
called
like
the
birds
themselves
became
a
fashionable
trimming
for
bonnets
and
have
continued
so
to
this
day
in
spite
of
law
and
argument
for
many
women
seem
to
be
savages
still
notwithstanding
their
fine
clothes
and
other
signs
of
civilization
these
herons
only
wear
their
beautiful
plumes
in
the
nesting
season
when
it
is
the
height
of
cruelty
to
kill
birds
of
any
kind
and
this
is
what
happens
when
the
nests
which
are
built
of
sticks
in
bushes
and
trees
above
the
lagoons
are
filled
with
young
as
yet
too
feeble
to
take
care
of
themselves
and
the
beautiful
parents
are
busy
flying
to
and
fro
attending
to
the
wants
of
their
helpless
nestlings
the
glide
among
them
noiselessly
threading
the
watercourses
in
an
indian
or
canoe
and
when
once
within
the
peaceful
colony
show
themselves
with
bold
brutality
for
well
they
know
that
the
devoted
parents
will
suffer
death
rather
than
leave
their
young
in
such
danger
shot
upon
shot
rings
out
in
repeated
volleys
each
followed
in
turn
by
the
piteous
cries
of
wounded
birds
till
the
ground
is
strewn
with
hundreds
of
the
dead
and
dying
then
the
cruel
hunters
tear
off
the
from
the
back
of
each
victim
as
the
savage
does
a
human
scalp
and
move
on
in
search
of
another
heronry
to
repeat
this
inhuman
slaughter
of
the
innocents
but
this
is
not
all
what
becomes
of
the
young
birds
they
must
either
perish
slowly
of
hunger
or
be
swallowed
by
the
snakes
that
infest
such
places
and
are
attracted
to
the
nests
by
the
clamoring
of
the
starving
orphans
now
do
you
wonder
that
i
call
this
beautiful
snowy
egret
the
bonnet
martyr
i
never
never
will
wear
any
kind
of
bird
feathers
again
said
dodo
and
when
i
go
back
to
school
i
am
going
to
make
a
guild
for
people
who
will
promise
not
to
either

their

harmless
decoration

own

his

by
growing
them

losing
his
life
they
are
the
only
kind
of
feathers
that
should
ever
be
worn
for
ornament

the

heron
pretty
feathers

asked
nat
who
felt
sorry
for
the
fate
of
the
egrets
but
did
not
like
to
show
it
and
so
tried
to
turn
the
subject
he
is
of
a
color
which
you
might
not
think
blue
at
all
and
he
too
wears
fine
plumes
on
his
head
breast
and
back
he
is
the
largest
bird
of
our
hundred
being
quite
as
tall
as
you
are

dodo
if
you
ever
see
one
of
these
birds
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
mill

you
will
never
forget
it
for
it
does
not
seem
like
an
american
bird

rather
like
a
visitor
from
strange
lands
you
may
imagine
it
to
be

the
whole

was

the
tide
rose
in

waves
and
the
children
were
glad
to
be
in

the
storm
played
so
many
strange
pranks
that
they
could
not
keep
away
from

said
olaf
it
will
be
a
week
before
i
dare
take
you
over
to
gull
island
but
i
was
talking
to
a
man
from
up
the
river
yesterday
and
he
says
the
reed
shallows
are
full
of
rails
maybe
you
like
to
see
them
rails
what
are
they
asked
nat
i
thought
rails
were
the
steel
things
that
cars
run
on
or
else
some
kind
of
fence
bars
the
rails
that
olaf
speaks
of
are
marsh
birds
said
the
doctor
some
are
about
as
big
as
robins
and
some
are
bigger
still
shaped
like
hens
with
long
curved
beaks
in
fact
some
members
of
the
family
are
called
marsh
hens
from
this
resemblance
olaf
often
guides
gunners
through
the
waterways
to
find
these
birds
he
shall
take
you
also
and
perhaps
you
may
find
some
old
marsh
wrens
nests
at
the
same
time
the
next
morning
was
clear
and
warm
and
the
children
tumbled
out
in
their
flannel
to
have
a
dip
before
breakfast
rap

rolling
over
and
over
on

in

as
soon
as
nat

not
venture
out
far

themselves

presently
nat
spied
something
on
the
stony
end
of
the
bar
that
stretched
out
at
the
right
of
the
beach
and
pointed
it
out
to
rap
who
said
they
are
some
sort
of
birds
you
had
better
get
the
glass
for
even
if
we
could
go
nearer
to
them
they
would
be
sure
to
see
us
and
skip
then
nat
brought
the
glass
and
they
each
took
a
peep
the
bodies
are
like
speckled
pullets
but
the
heads
are
like
and
the
legs
are
very
thin
said
rap
see
there
is
a
different
one
ever
so
much
nearer
over
on
this
side

i
ca
make
him
out
very
well
here
comes
the
doctor
all
ready
to
go
in

of
course
he
can
tell
us
those
mottled
birds
with
red
legs
are
turnstones

looking
a
moment

are

run
about
the
rock
bars

sandy
beaches
turning
over
small

very

more

up

river
said
the
doctor
why
do
you
call
us
sandpipers
uncle
roy
asked
nat
because
sandpipers
are
little
birds
that
run
along
the
water
edge
where
they
patter
about
and
whistle
but
ca
swim
and
they
all
raced
laughing
up
to
the
cabin
rap
saying
cheerfully
then
i
not
a
sandpiper
for
i
hop
like
a
robin
instead
of
running
in
the
afternoon
olaf
had
the
sharpie
which
is
a
flat
boat
with
two
masts
ready
with
a
little
dingey
tied
on
behind
and
when
the
tide
rose
the
party
went
aboard
first
he
headed
well
out
into
the
bay
and
then
tacked
to
enter
the
river
where
the
channel
was
deepest
the
river
which
was
the
same
that
ran
through
the
woods
above
the
farm
was
caught
in
a
corner
to
make
the
and
finally
escaping
ran
along
for
many
miles
until
the
bay
opened
its
wide
arms
to
receive
it
what
are
those
birds
over
there
cried
nat
pointing
toward
the
outer
beacon
some
look
like
white
crows
and
the
others
go
zigzag
like
big
barn
swallows
are
there
any
such
things
as
water
swallows
uncle
roy
not
exactly
both
the
birds
you
see
belong
to
the
swimmers
the
larger
ones
are
herring
gulls
and
the
smaller
ones
are
terns
but
your
guess
is
not
a
bad
one
for
all
terns
are
also
called
sea
swallows
because
of
their
dashing
flight
both
gulls
and
terns
nest
on
gull
island
where
olaf
is
going
to
take
us
some
day
when
the
water
is
smooth
the
storm
has
driven
some
of
them
into
the
bay
where
they
do
not
usually
come
until
later
in
the
year
but
in
winter
great
flocks
of
gulls
live
about
our
beach
clamming
on
the
bar
at
every
low
tide
i
guess
we
had
better
tie
up
yonder
said
olaf
when
they
had
gone
a
couple
of
miles
up
the
river
and
then
i
can
put
the
children
in
the
little
boat
and
pole
them
in
among
the
reeds
so
the
doctor
and
olive
went
ashore
where
the
sharpie
was
tied
to
the
end
of
what
had
once
been
a
small
wharf
while
dodo
nat
and
rap
crouched
down
in
the
dingey
obeying
olaf
order
to
keep
very
still
and
not
make
the
boat
tip
the
little
creek
that
they
entered
was
quite
narrow
and
soon
grew
to
be
only
a
thread
of
water
where
they
could
touch
the
reeds
on
both
sides
they
heard
many
rustling
sounds
but
for
some
time
could
see
nothing
olaf
who
was
watching
suddenly
laid
down
his
pole
and
seizing
an
oar
gave
the
water
two
or
three
sharp
slaps
instantly
half
a
dozen
birds
started
out
flapping
and
sprawling
with
their
legs
dangling
one
or
two
seeming
to
slide
across
the
water
till
they
all
disappeared
among
the
flags
again
oh
how
funny
they
are
cried
nat
they
have
such
faces
little
perky
tails
like
a
wren
and
such
long
loose
feet
why
did
they
fly
instead
of
dodging
about
so
are
their
nests
in
the
reeds
they
do
nest
here
but
now
that
the
season
is
over
they
stay
about
picking
up
food
from
the
mud
until
they
shift
southward
a
piece
for
the
winter
these
rails
fly
well
enough
when
they
once
get
started
and
go
a
long
way
without
stopping
but
they
are
lazy
about
it
in
their
summer
homes
where
they
only
flap
up
and
then
dodge
down
again
to
hide
so
they
are
easy
shooting
too
easy
to
be
any
sport
it
what
i
call
killing
not
hunting
illustration
virginia
rail
what
a
strange
note
they
have
said
rap
something
like
a
woodpecker
call
yes
but
you
should
hear
the
noise
they
make
in
spring
when
there
are
crowds
of
birds
along
the
river
and
back
in
the
meadows
the
redwings
and
meadowlarks
sing
all
day
long
the
marsh
wrens
come
along
to
join
in
the
snipe
begin
to
call
the
spotted
sandpipers
whistle
up
and
we
get
a
visit
from
the
wild
geese
as
they
fly
north
i
tell
you
it
is
fine
to
be
down
here
then
but
in
fall
i
rather
be
up
at
the
lake
by
the
lumber
camp
when
the
snow
brings
the
foxes
and
other
wild
animals
out
do
stop
a
minute
please
olaf
and
do
tell
quite
so
fast
pleaded
dodo
uncle
roy
never
does
you
have
said
the
names
of
ever
so
many
birds
that
we
do
know
and
when
he
does
that
he
always
stops
and
explains
snipe
and
spotted
sandpipers
please
begin
with
those
olaf
thought
for
a
minute
he
knew
all
the
game
and
water
birds
in
fact
they
were
intimate
friends
of
his
but
it
was
not
so
easy
for
him
to
describe
them
did
you
ever
see
a
woodcock
he
began
yes
oh
yes
cried
nat
uncle
roy
showed
us
a
stuffed
one
in
the
wonder
room
and
told
us
all
about
its
long
beak
with
a
point
like
a
finger
to
feel
for
its
food
in
the
mud
because
its
eyes
are
too
far
back
to
see
well
in
front
and
all
about
its
sky
dance
and
rap
has
seen
one
sitting
on
its
nest
in
a
spring
snowstorm
well
the
snipe
that
comes
about
here
belongs
to
the
same
family
and
also
pokes
in
the
mud
for
its
food
that
is
why
it
likes
to
live
near
fresh
water
like
the
woodcock
where
the
mud
is
soft
rather
than
on
the
where
the
sand
is
gritty
it
a
mighty
shy
bird
and
tell
any
one
what
it
means
to
do
i
heard
them
come
calling
over
the
beach
at
night
sometimes
though
and
i
suspect
they
go
to
the
muddy
side
of
the
bar
to
feed
but
i
never
seen
them
there
they
mostly
do
their
coming
and
going
at
night
and
fly
high
too
even
then
sandpipers
do
bore
in
the
ground
for
their
food
but
just
pick
it
up
so
they
keep
along
the
shore
of
either
fresh
or
salt
water
some
kinds
choosing
one
place
and
some
another
the
spotted
sandpiper
is
another
of
the
little
fellows
who
sometimes
nests
back
in
those
meadows
he
is
not
a
bit
shy
but
runs
about
as
tame
as
a
robin
and
he
is
as
big
as
a
robin
either
sometimes
they
lay
their
eggs
in
the
meadow
and
sometimes
among
the
back
of
the
beach
they
lay
four
eggs
very
big
at
one
end
and
peaked
at
the
other
and
put
them
in
the
nest
with
the
pointed
ends
together
in
the
middle
to
take
up
less
room
and
they
spotted
all
over
they
hang
about
here
all
summer
we
call
them
because
they
always
tip
up
their
tails
and
bob
so
when
they
run
they
whistle
like
this
illustration
wilson
snipe
there
another
mite
of
a
sandpiper
that
comes
around
here
late
every
summer
though
it
nests
way
up
north
it
is
the
very
littlest
of
all
not
bigger
than
a
sparrow
so
pretty
and
that
it
ought
to
go
with
singing
birds
and
never
be
shot
for
food
i
often
had
them
run
along
in
front
of
me
on
the
beach
piping
as
sad
as
if
they
were
telling
me
how
little
and
helpless
they
were
and
begging
me
to
ask
folks
not
to
shoot
them
then
olaf
pushed
up
the
creek
a
little
further
hoping
to
be
able
to
land
or
else
reach
some
marsh
wrens
nests
from
the
boat
but
one
nest
was
all
they
could
find
a
ball
of
grasses
fastened
between
two
flags
olaf
cut
the
stalks
carefully
and
presented
it
to
dodo
much
to
her
delight
then
he
paddled
back
to
the
river
where
they
found
olive
waiting
with
some
beautiful
in
her
hands
while
their
uncle
said
that
he
had
in
his
handkerchief
a
strange
plant
that
ate
insects
but
dodo
thought
that
he
was
joking
and
as
soon
as
they
were
in
the
sharpie
she
whispered
uncle
roy
you
must
tell
me
four
tables
olaf
knows
the
birds
by
sight
but
he
does
make
them
sound
as
distinct
as
you
do
in
the
telling
illustration
least
sandpiper
so
missy
is
flattering
her
old
bird
man
well
tell
me
the
names
for
i
suppose
you
can
remember
them
oh
yes
but
come
to
think
of
it
i
do
think
olaf
said
what
the
wise
men
call
these
birds
one
was
a
rail
one
was
a
snipe
with
eyes
and
a
like
a
woodcock
one
was
a
spotted
sandpiper
that
teeters
and
whistles
and
the
other
was
a
tiny
little
sandpiper
with
a
very
sad
cry
now
do
you
know
them
famous
laughed
the
doctor
of
course
i
know
them
after
that
do
they
all
belong
to
the
same
family
persisted
dodo
whose
little
head
was
beginning
to
swim
with
all
this
new
knowledge
it
had
to
hold
not
all
of
them
the
snipe
and
both
the
sandpipers
belong
to
one
family
the
same
as
that
of
the
woodcock
but
the
rail
belongs
to
a
different
family
so
also
does
the
plover
you
learned
this
morning
the
three
families
of
snipes
plovers
and
rails
are
the
largest
ones
of
all
the
tribe
of
birds
that
paddle
and
wade
by
the
the
rails
from
their
size
and
shape
are
sometimes
called
marsh
hens
the
turnstone
belongs
to
a
fourth
family
but
it
is
a
very
small
one
now
i
will
give
you
the
tables
of
the
four
kinds
of
birds
you
have
learned
this
afternoon

of

they
were

also
in

ways
for
they
had
found
out
many
things
for
themselves
which
is
the
very
best
sort
of
wisdom
now

the

almost
flew
out

that
you
have
seen
about

there

this
island
as
well
as
the

for
all
the

birds
in

i
should
think
it
would
be

it
is
as
much
as
fifteen
miles
from

they
do

they
fly
there
said
olaf
can
ducks
fly
exclaimed
dodo
in
amazement
i
sure
the
white
ducks
at
the
farm
can
only
waddle
on
the
ground
or
swim
and
spatter
along
the
water
when
wolf
or
quick
chases
them
for
fun
and
anyway
their
legs
are
very
stiff
and
queer
and
grow
very
far
back
as
if
their
bodies
were
too
heavy
and
going
to
fall
down
front
and
they
had
to
hold
up
their
heads
very
high
to
keep
going
our
tame
ducks
are
very
fat
and
lazy
for
they
have
lived
in
captivity
for
many
generations
yet
they
could
fly
very
well
with
a
little
practice
the
mallard
which
is
a
wild
river
duck
and
a
swift
enduring
flyer

the
one
which
has

for
hundreds
of
years
kept

barnyard
duck
river
ducks
questioned
rap
then
are
there
different
kinds
of
ducks
for
rivers
and
lakes
and
for
salt
water
there
are
indeed
many
kinds
of
ducks
said
the
doctor
all
of
which
have
easy
marks
of
identification
in
the
on
the
wings
and
many
other
points
about
the
plumage
as
well
as
the
different
shapes
of
their
heads
bills
and
feet
though
all
wild
ducks
and
geese
too
belong
to
one
general
family
they
are
divided
into
separate
groups
like
cousins
instead
of
living
in
one
household
like
brothers
almost
all
wild
ducks
nest
in
the
northern
tier
of
states
or
altogether
north
of
them
the
hardier
species
stay
with
us
as
winter
visitors
but
the
others
only
stop
to
feed
as
they
follow
the
rivers
and
coasts
in
their
migrations
there
was
a
beautiful
duck
that
had
a
nest
last
year
in
a
tree
up
near
the
logging
camp
its
feathers
were
as
bright
as
if
they
had
been
painted
that
is
the
wood
duck
one
of
the
exceptions
to
the
rule
that
wild
ducks
nest
on
the
ground
like
tame
ones
another
kind
the
black
duck
nests
as
usual
on
the
ground
on
a
wooded
island
not
far
from
the
one
to
which
we
are
sailing
will
you
please
tell
us
why
ducks
have
such
waddling
legs
begged
nat
because
the
best
legs
to
swim
with
are
not
the
easiest
to
walk
with
at
that
moment
the
wind
died
down
the
sails
flapped
once
or
twice
and
then
hung
loose
and
the
boat
instead
of
dashing
along
began
to
drift
lazily
with
an
uncomfortable
rolling
motion
as
the
swell
borne
in
from
the
ocean
many
miles
away
crept
under
it
if
the
water
does
that
much
more
i
shall
soon
be
hungry
said
dodo
looking
a
trifle
sad
and
pressing
her
hands
together
over
her
waist
i
quite
agree
with
you
said
olive
i
know
from
having
had
the
same
feeling
before
that
unless
we
eat
some
of
these
little
salt
biscuits
and
talk
about
something
interesting
in
a
very
few
minutes
you
and
i
will
be
which
is
the
hungriest
emptiest
sickness
possible
i
thought
the
feeling
was
a
little
more
puffy
than
real
hungriness
said
dodo
chewing
her
biscuit
in
great
haste
and
having
some
trouble
in
swallowing
it
may
not
we
men
have
some
too
asked
the
doctor
looking
drolly
at
the
boys
who
were
glancing
longingly
at
the
biscuits
but
were
too
proud
to
confess
their
feelings
not
that
we
feel
ill
oh
no
merely
for
company
you
know
now
while
you
munch
away
i
will
talk
duck
to
amuse
you
eating
and
duck
talk
go
very
well
together
for
the
duck
is
chiefly
to
be
considered
as
food
you
all
know
what
a
compact
body
a
duck
has
do
you
remember
having
seen
one
carved
and
how
very
hard
it
was
to
cut
off
its
legs
yes
i
do
said
nat
sometimes
the
duck
almost
bounces
off
the
dish
and
then
father
says
things
at
least
i
mean
he
says
he
wishes
that
people
who
go
shooting
and
send
him
presents
of
wild
ducks
would
send
a
carving
map
and
a
good
sharp
knife
with
them
but
i
never
understood
what
he
wanted
the
map
for
to
find
the
joints
my
boy
laughed
the
doctor
as
if
he
had
a
sympathetic
feeling
for
carvers
who
find
themselves
in
front
of
a
tough
duck
or
goose
no
matter
how
well
they
know
where
the
joints
ought
to
be
found
a
duck
legs
are
very
short
and
not
only
set
far
back
on
the
body
but
sunk
into
the
skin
quite
up
to
the
knees
so
that
the
joints
are
very
hard
to
find
this
is
planned
to
give
the
duck
more
strength
and
ease
in
swimming
when
the
legs
act
like
paddles
all
ducks
feet
have
three
long
toes
in
front
and
a
short
one
behind
the
front
toes
being
loosely
joined
by
two
skin
flaps
which
stretch
between
them
when
spread
apart
making
what
we
call
something
the
way
frogs
feet
are
asked
nat
very
much
upon
the
same
plan
then
ducks
have
wide
flat
beaks
of
various
shapes
with
a
sort
of
nail
bent
over
like
a
hook
at
the
end
and
all
along
each
side
is
a
double
row
of
little
teeth
to
help
them
take
their
food
their
stiff
pointed
wings
are
quite
strong
enough
to
lift
their
heavy
bodies
off
the
ground
or
water
into
the
air
and
keep
up
an
even
flight
often
more
rapid
than
the
swiftest
express
train
what
do
wild
ducks
eat
asked
dodo
seeds
or
bugs
or
fish
they
eat
all
those
things
and
many
others
too
according
to
their
various
habits
which
are
as
different
as
the
expression
of
their
faces
or
the
color
of
their
features
if
you
look
at
a
case
full
of
wild
ducks
in
a
museum
you
will
find
that
no
two
have
the
head
or
expression
some
look
silly
some
sly
while
others
seem
either
proud
or
inquisitive
how
strange
said
rap
i
never
thought
about
ducks
faces
except
that
they
all
looked
foolish
with
little
and
big
beaks
like
shovels
and
please
do
they
chew
their
food
with
the
teeth
you
said
they
had
those
are
not
true
teeth
like
ours
to
chew
with
you
know
a
good
many
very
different
things
are
called
teeth
those
on
a
rake
for
example
or
a
comb
or
a
a
duck
teeth
are
horny
like
the
skin
that
covers
its
whole
beak
and
act
like
strainers
when
a
duck
dabbles
in
the
water
as
you
have
all
seen
tame
ones
do
the
water
that
gets
into
its
mouth
runs
out
at
the
sides
between
the
teeth
but
whatever
food
there
is
in
the
mouthful
of
water
gets
caught
in
the
teeth
and
can
then
be
swallowed
please
tell
us
continued
rap
how
many
different
kinds
of
ducks
there
are
in
our
country
about
forty
answered
the
doctor
but
i
shall
not
trouble
you
to
learn
more
than
a
few
of
the
common
ones
they
all
belong
to
one
family
which
also
contains
the
geese
and
swans
they
are
divided
into
three
groups
fishing
ducks
river
or
ducks
and
sea
ducks
the
fishing
ducks
are
great
swimmers
and
divers
living
chiefly
on
the
fish
they
catch
by
chasing
them
under
water
their
beaks
are
narrow
hooked
and
sharply
toothed
which
makes
it
easy
for
them
to
hold
their
slippery
prey
but
this
oily
food
makes
their
flesh
so
rank
that
none
of
them
is
fit
food
for
house
people
they
are
all
called
mergansers
and
we
have
in
this
country
four
different
species
the
river
ducks
are
those
that
we
see
mostly
in
the
spring
and
fall
migrations
they
have
the
handsomest
plumage
and
the
most
delicate
flesh
they
feed
along
shallow
rivers
ponds
and
lakes
after
the
manner
of
barnyard
ducks
for
the
mallard
is
one
of
them
and
tame
ducks
are
domesticated
mallards
as
i
told
you
in
feeding
they
bob
head
downward
in
the
water
with
their
tails
straight
up
in
the
air
to
find
the
roots
seeds
insects
small
and
other
things
they
like
to
eat
they
build
very
good
nests
usually
on
the
ground
and
warmly
lined
with
their
own
down
which
the
parent
plucks
from
her
breast
to
cover
the
eggs
the
color
of
the
eggs
is
always
greenish
gray
drab
or
buff
never
with
any
spots
most
river
ducks
nest
in
the
far
north
but
there
are
some
exceptions
the
wood
duck
that
rap
saw
by
the
lake
is
one
of
these
exceptions
and
has
the
most
beautiful
plumage
of
all
our
ducks
it
does
not
build
its
nest
on
the
ground
like
most
others
of
its
family
but
in
a
tree
hole
like
an
owl
or
a
woodpecker
how
can
the
little
ducks
get
down
to
the
ground
do
their
wings
grow
strong
very
soon
asked
nat
you
have
seen
that
most
birds
come
from
the
egg
quite
naked
and
stay
in
the
nest
till
their
feathers
grow
like
canaries
and
all
other
song
birds
while
others
are
hatched
all
covered
with
down
the
same
as
chickens
are
the
young
of
those
living
in
open
exposed
places
such
as
sea
and
shore
birds
are
thickly
clothed
with
down
when
hatched
such
downy
plumage
is
not
exactly
like
the
feathers
that
sprout
after
a
while
but
it
answers
the
same
purpose
for
the
little
things
could
not
run
about
or
swim
if
they

i

wood
duck
when
little
wood
ducks
are
hatched
and
become
quite
dry
their
mother
takes
them
in
her
beak
by
the
wing
one
by
one
and
flies
down
to
the
ground
with
them
as
soon
as
her
brood
of
ten
or
a
dozen
is
thus
collected
she
leads
them
off
to
the
nearest
water
and
the
whole
lot
of
ducklings
go
in
swimming
bobbing
for
food
as
if
they
were
a
year
old
instead
of
only
a
few
hours
then
mamma
begins
to
drill
them
in
so
that
at
the
slightest
hint
from
her
they
dive
and
swim
out
of
harm
way
sea
ducks
do
not
always
live
on
the
ocean
as
the
name
would
lead
you
to
expect
but
prefer
large
open
waters
either
fresh
like
those
of
lakes
or
salt
as
in
bays
and
sounds
they
eat
both
animal
and
vegetable
food
oftentimes
diving
deeply
and
swimming
far
under
water
to
find
it
of
course
they
in
common
with
all
other
ducks
must
take
a
vast
amount
of
mud
and
water
into
their
mouths
with
their
food
but
instead
of
having
to
swallow
this
it
drains
off
through
the
little
grooves
on
the
inside
edges
of
the
bill
as
a
ship
deck
is
drained
of
water
by
means
of
the
scuppers
but
that
i
have
explained
to
you
already
some
sea
ducks
are
more
plentiful
than
their
river
brethren
and
as
they
spend
both
their
days
and
nights
offshore
they
run
less
danger
of
extermination
most
of
them
nest
also
in
the
far
north
in
much
the
same
fashion
as
river
ducks
do
two
celebrated
members
of
this
group
are
the
redhead
and
the
canvasback
who
are
always
welcome
guests
at
dinner
and
are
so
much
alike
in
the
crisp
brown
company
dress
they
wear
on
the
table
with
plenty
of
stuffing
and
gravy
that
very
few
persons
can
tell
them
apart
but
the
most
famous
one
of
all
is
the
eider
duck
the
one
which
yields
such
an
abundance
of
exquisitely
soft
warm
down
that
we
use
it
for
making
the
best
sort
of
bedquilts
can
you
always
tell
a
sea
duck
from
a
river
duck
by
the
feathers
or
how
asked
rap
you
can
always
tell
them
by
their
feet
answered
the
doctor
for
every
sea
duck
has
a
little
flap
of
skin
hanging
like
an
apron
from
the
hind
toe
while
the
hind
toe
of
every
river
duck
is
round
and
slim
like
a
hen
i
should
think
there
would
always
be
plenty
of
sea
ducks
said
rap
for
if
they
live
so
far
out
they
ought
to
be
able
to
take
care
of
themselves
and
swim
or
fly
away
from
everybody
you
would
think
so
my
boy
but
when
man
with
his
many
inventions
sets
out
to
kill
there
is
little
chance
of
escape
for
bird
or
beast
sea
ducks
are
hunted
in
their
nesting
homes
not
only
for
their
flesh
and
eggs
but
for
the
downy
feathers
with
which
the
nest
is
lined
in
their
migrations
overland
every
hand
is
set
against
them
if
they
pause
to
rest
or
feed
but
when
they
reach
deep
water
they
must
be
safe
for
they
can
fly
faster
than
any
boat
can
sail
after
them
said
rap
sail
yes
but
men
go
in
and
even
to
surround
the
flocks
of
wild
ducks
that
are
lying
low
trusting
perhaps
to
a
covering
of
fog
and
when
it
lifts
these
water
commit
slaughter
which
it
would
be
slander
to
call
sport
oh
look
cried
rap
there
are
hundreds
of
gulls
over
there
and
sea
swallows
too
there
is
the
island
for
the
breeze
has
come
up
and
we
have
sailed
ever
so
far
without
noticing
it
there
is
a
great
flock
of
gulls
going
off
together
are
they
beginning
their
fall
journey
no
they
are
only
going
to
some
harbor
to
feed
they
belong
to
a
guild
of
water
birds
that
i
think
we
might
call
sea
sweepers
for
they
clear
from
the
surface
of
the
water
the
refuse
that
the
tide
would
otherwise
throw
upon
the
beaches
they
also
follow
in
the
wake
of
ships
for
the
same
purpose
neither
gulls
nor
terns
can
dive
far
under
water
like
ducks
for
their
bodies
are
too
light
but
they
all
pounce
down
on
wing
and
contrive
to
catch
small
fish
swimming
just
below
the
surface
look
at
the
difference
between
the
flight
of
the
two
the
tern
half
folds
his
long
pointed
wings
and
darts
down
like
lightning
in
a
second
he
is
up
in
the
air
again
dashing
off
with
capricious
flight
holding
his
beak
to
his
breast
as
the
woodcock
does
but
the
gull
sails
more
slowly
settles
deliberately
and
often
floats
quietly
on
the
surface
then
when
he
rises
on
wing
with
some
ceremony
he
flaps
off
with
his
beak
held
straight
before
him
like
a
duck
terns
are
the
better
flyers
but
gulls
are
decidedly
the
more
expert
swimmers
are
gulls
and
terns

asked
dodo
they
both

have
been

among
the
best
known
of
all

american
herring
gull
who
lives
on

uncle
roy
said
dodo
you
can
not
stop
on

to
write
them
out

i
will
remember
to
give
them
to
you
as
soon
as

to

cabin
when
shall
we
ever
see
these

sighed
dodo
thinking
of
the
long
list
there
would
be
to
write
because
i
can
remember
better
when
i
see
things
than
if
i
only
hear
about
them
do
you
realize
that
when
you
go
back
to
the
farm
it
will
be
time
for
birds
to
begin
their
autumn
journeys
and
that
they
will
be
passing
by
until
the
snow
is
on
the

why
may
you
not
meet
some
of
these
ducks
by
the
river
or
see
them
swimming
on
the

or
if
you
are
not
so
lucky
you
must
look
for
them
in

some

are

gull
island
was
only
a
great
sand
heap
anchored
by
rocks
and
covered
with
coarse
grass
but
the
children
had
hardly
taken
a
few
steps
along
the
beach
when
they
began
to
exclaim
at
the
number
of
strange
birds
some
were
flying
others
walking
about
on
the
sand
where
there
were
many
tufts
of
grass
and
mats
of
seaweeds
that
looked
as
if
they
had
been
used
for
nests
dodo
nearly
stepped
upon
a
couple
of
greenish
eggs
that
were
nearly
as
large
as
a
hen
are
the
gulls
still
nesting
uncle

and
what
are
those
dark
streaky
birds
over
there
these
are
eggs
that
did
not
hatch
for
nesting
is
over
in
july
at

and
the
dark
birds
are
young
gulls
in
their
first
plumage
they
are
brownish
gray
streaked
and
spotted
as
you
see
while
the
old
birds
are
with
backs
and
black
and
white
in
the
summer
though
their
winter
dress
is
not
quite
so
pure
being
streaked
with
gray
on
the
neck
then
the
very
dark
gulls
i
have
seen
off
our
beach
in
winter
are
the
young
ones
said
rap
i
never
knew
that
before
i
do
believe
many
people
remember
how
birds
change
their
colors
and
a
great
many
never
heard
about
it
at
all
i
guess
gulls
walk
very
nicely
said

much
better
than
ducks
and
how
they
bob
up
and
down
like
little
boats
when
they
float

screamed
half
a
dozen
flying
up
as
if
to
tell
the
brotherhood
of
the
coming
of
strangers
what
can
be
the
matter
with
all
those
sea
swallows
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
asked
nat
as
they
walked
across
and
a
flock
of
a
hundred
or
more
terns
angled
by
crying
mournfully
what
a
very
sad
noise
they
are
making
do
you
think
they
are
afraid
of
us
they
have
reason
enough
to
cry
and
be
sad
answered
olaf
who
was
walking
on
a
little
way
ahead
they
have
been
driven
from
almost
all
these
islands
shot
for
their
pretty
feathers
and
had
their
nests
robbed
there
would
be
any
here
now
only
that
some
people
pay
the
at
the
little
island
yonder
to
see
that
the
law
is
kept
and
that
no
one
hunts
them
here
see
he
is
coming
over
now
to
find
out
what
we
are
doing
here
who
are
the
people
that
pay
him
uncle

asked
dodo
the
wise
men
illustration
common
tern
yes
the
wise
men
and
some
wise
women
too
you
can
give
a
part
of
the
money
in
your
tin
bank
to
help
the
poor
birds
if
you
wish
oh
yes
that
is
i
forgot
and
dodo
whispered
in
her
uncle
ear
that
she
as
well
as
nat
was
saving
money
to
buy
rap
a
bird
book
for
christmas
it
seems
to
be
a
very
open
place
for
nests
out
here
on
the
sand
said
rap
i
suppose
the
little
gulls
and
terns
must
be
hatched
with
on
yes
though
they
are
not
able
to
take
care
of
themselves
as
quickly
as
young
ducks
but
as
soon
as
they
can
leave
the
nest
they
walk
down
to
the
water
edge
and
eat
a
sort
of
gluey
stuff
that
floats
in
on
the
water
so
you
see
that
unless
the
law
protected
them
they
might
be
very
easily
stolen
or
destroyed
before
their
wings
were
strong
enough
to
fly
it
must
be
very
cold
for
them
here
in
the
winter
it
would
be
if
they
were
obliged
to
stay
but
both
gulls
and
terns
scatter
all
over
the
country
to
winter
though
the
terns
travel
much
further
south
by
this
time
the
lighthouse
keeper
had
made
his
way
over
to
them
finding
who
they
were
he
invited
them
to
bring
their
luncheon
and
row
over
to
little
gull
island
with
him
to
see
the
lighthouse
there
was
a
dancing
breeze
when
they
turned
homeward
that
afternoon
the
boat
canted
saucily
and
little
feathers
of
spray
kept
tickling
nose
are
there
any
more
water
birds
that
we
are
likely
to
see
this
fall
asked
nat
as
the
gull
islands
disappeared
behind
them
there
will
be
great
flocks
of
wild
geese
coming
down
from
the
north
and
they
often
rest
on
the
mill
pond
or
a
loon
may
chance
down
the
river
and
a
grebe
or
two
are
geese
ducks
asked
dodo
and
then
laughed
with
the
others
at
the
question
not
precisely
no
more
than
rats
are
mice
said
the
doctor
but
both
ducks
and
geese
belong
to
the
same
family
and
what
are
the
others
the
loons
and
grubs
are
they
wading
or
swimming
birds
not
grubs
laughed
the
doctor
loons
and
grebes
are
swimming
birds
like
ducks
or
gulls
but
both
belong
to
quite
a
different
order
from
any
of
the
others
and
each
of
them
belongs
to
a
family
of
its
own
they
can
barely
move
at
all
on
land
and
spend
all
their
lives
on
the
water
excepting
in
the
nesting
season
when
they
make
curious
floating
nests
of
dead
herbage
in
reedy
marshes
their
logs
are
placed
in
such
a
backward
position
that
they
can
sit
upright
in
the
water
and
swim
as
if
they
were
walking
only
keeping
the
tip
of
the
bill
above
the
surface
how
can
they
get
away
if
any
one
hunts
them
asked
rap
they
can
dive
at
the
flash
of
a
gun
and
swim
long
distances
under
water
our
familiar
grebe
or
dabchick
disappears
so
suddenly
that
witch
is
one
of
its
common
names
what
a
lot
of
birds
there
are
to
watch
for
this
fall
said
nat
very
anxiously
i
only
wish
i
knew
how
much
more
time
we
shall
have
before
father

mother
come
for
us
illustration

why
there
is
one
of
the
men
from

said
rap
as
they
tacked
close
to
the
beach
half
an
hour
later
he
is
waving
a
letter
or
something
i
think
it
did
not
take
the
party
long
to
land
or
the
doctor
to
read
his
letter
which
said
that
nat
and
dodo
parents
were
coming
to
the
farm
in
a
couple
of
days
so
we
must
go
home
said
the
doctor
i
want
to
see
mother
awfully
much
said
dodo
and
father
too
but
do
you
think
if
you
told
them
bird
stories
uncle
roy
you
might
be
able
to
coax
them
to
make
you
a
long
visit
before
they
take
us
home
think
father
would
rather
go
up
to
the
logging
camp
and
see
the
coons
that
rap
says
they
catch
there
in
the
fall
there
are
red
foxes
too
he
says
and
little
fur
beasts
the
doctor
did
not
give
them
a
very
satisfactory
answer
but
if
they
had
looked
they
would
have
seen
a
merry
twinkle
in
his
eye
and
dodo
who
had
learned
not
to
tease
during
her
happy
summer
nestled
up
to
olive
and
said
i
smell
a
secret
somewhere
but
i
can
wait
for
i
know
that
hereabouts
secrets
are
always
nice
surprises
when
five
