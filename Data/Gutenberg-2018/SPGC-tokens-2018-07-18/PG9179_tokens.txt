has
the
form
of
a
colossal

lacking

broken
in
some
of
its
outlines
and
rough
and

it
for

in

warfare
of

and
so
left

raised
high
out
of
the

at

end
and
sunk

into

at
the

where
the
eastern
part
rises

on

away
from

piled

with
trees
that
loose
their
leaves
ere
snowflakes
fly
and
with
steadfast
evergreens
which
hold
to
theirs
through

and
the
saddening

over
the

of

southward
upon
the

of

of
the

growing
grass
she
embossed
noble

on

she
did
in

has
wrought

has
she

finished
with
its
destinies
as
she
has
not
yet
finished
with
anything
in
the
universe
while
therefore
she
continues
her
will
and
pleasure
elsewhere
throughout
creation
she
does
not
forget
the
shield
she
likes
sometimes
to
set
upon

which
admonish

how
little
his

has
changed

sets

but
there
with
the
old
things
she
mingles
new
things
with
the
never
changing
the
ever
changing
for
the
old
that
remains
always
the
new
and
the
new
that
perpetually
becomes
old
these
nature
allots
to
man
as
his
two
portions
wherewith
he
must
abide
steadfast
in
what
he
is
and
go
upward
or
go
downward
through
all
that
he
is
to
become
but
of
the
many
scenes
which
she
in
our
time
sets
forth
upon
the
stately
grassy
shield
there
is
a
single
spectacle
that
she
spreads
over
the
length
and
breadth
of
it
once
every
year
now
as
best
liked
by
the
entire
people
and
this
is
both
old
and
new
it
is
old
because
it
contains
man
s
faith
in
his
immortality
which
was
venerable
with
age
before
the
shield
of
achilles
ever
grew
effulgent
before
the
sightless
orbs
of
homer
it
is
new
because
it
contains
those
latest
hopes
and
reasons
for
this
faith
which
briefly
blossom
out
upon
the
primitive
stock
with
the
altering
years
and
soon
are
blown
away
upon
the
winds
of
change
since
this
spectacle
this
festival
is
thus
old
and
is
thus
new
and
thus
enwraps
the
deepest
thing
in
the
human
spirit
it
is
never
forgotten
when
in
vernal
days
any
one
turns
a
furrow
or
sows
in
the
teeth
of
the
wind
and
glances
at
the
fickle
sky
when
under
the
summer
shade
of
a
flowering
tree
any
one
looks
out
upon
his
fatted
herds
and
fattening
grain
whether
there
is
autumnal
plenty
in
his
barn
or
autumnal
emptiness
autumnal
peace
in
his
breast
or
autumnal
strife
all
days
of
the
year
in
the
in
the
whatsoever
of
good
or
ill
befall
in
mind
or
hand
never
does
one
forget
when
nights
are
darkest
and
days
most
dark
when
the
sun
seems
farthest
from
the
planet
and
cheers
it
with
lowest
heat
when
the
fields
lie
shorn
between
and
and
man
turns
wistful
eyes
back
and
forth
between
the
mystery
of
his
origin
and
the
mystery
of
his
end
then
comes
the
great
pageant
of
the
winter
solstice
then
comes
christmas
so
what
is
christmas
and
what
for
centuries
has
it
been
to
differing
but
always
identical
mortals
it
was
once
the
old
pagan
festival
of
dead
nature
it
was
once
the
old
pagan
festival
of
the
reappearing
sun
it
was
the
pagan
festival
when
the
hands
of
labor
took
their
rest
and
hunger
took
its
fill
it
was
the
pagan
festival
to
honor
the
descent
of
the
fabled
inhabitants
of
an
upper
world
upon
the
earth
their
commerce
with
common
flesh
and
the
production
of
a
race
of
it
is
now
the
festival
of
the
immortal
child
appearing
in
the
midst
of
mortal
children
it
is
now
the
new
festival
of
man
s
remembrance
of
his
errors
and
his
charity
toward
erring
neighbors
it
has
latterly
become
the
widening
festival
of
universal
brotherhood
with
succor
for
all
need
and
nighness
to
all
suffering
of
good
will
warring
against
ill
will
and
of
peace
warring
upon
war
and
thus
for
all
who
have
anywhere
come
to
know
it
christmas
is
the
festival
of
the
better
worldly
self
but
better
than
worldliness
it
is
on
the
shield
what
it
essentially
has
been
through
many
an
age
to
many
people
the
symbolic
earth
festival
of
the
evergreen
setting
forth
man
s
pathetic
love
of
youth
of
his
own
youth
that
will
not
stay
with
him
and
renewing
his
faith
in
a
destiny
that
winds
its
ancient
way
upward
out
of
dark
and
damp
toward
eternal
light
this
is
a
story
of
the
earth
festival
on
the
earth
shield
i
the
man
and
the
secret
a
man
sat
writing
near
a
window
of
an
old
house
out
in
the
country
a
few
years
ago
it
was
afternoon
of
the
of
december
one
of
the
volumes
of
a
work
on
american
forestry
lay
open
on
the
desk
near
his
right
hand
and
as
he
sometimes
stopped
in
his
writing
and
turned
the
leaves
the
illustrations
showed
that
the
long
road
of
his
mental
travels
for
such
he
followed
was
now
passing
through
the
evergreens
many
notes
were
printed
at
the
bottoms
of
the
pages
they
burned
there
like
short
tapers
in
dim
places
often
lighting
up
obscure
faiths
and
customs
of
our
puzzled
human
race
his
eyes
roved
from
taper
to
taper
as
gathering
knowledge
ray
by
ray
a
small
book
lay
near
the
large
one
it
dealt
with
primitive
and
it
belonged
in
the
class
of
those
that
are
kept
under
lock
and
key
by
the
libraries
which
possess
them
as
unsafe
reading
for
unsafe
minds
sheets
of
paper
covered
with
the
man
s
clear
deliberate
handwriting
lay
thickly
on
the
desk
a
table
in
the
centre
of
the
room
was
strewn
with
volumes
some
of
a
secret
character
opened
for
reference
on
the
tops
of
two
bookcases
and
on
the
mantelpiece
were
prints
representing
scenes
from
the
oldest
known
art
of
the
east
these
and
other
prints
hanging
about
the
walls
however
remote
from
each
other
in
the
times
and
places
where
they
had
been
gathered
brought
together
in
this
room
of
a
quiet
kentucky
farmhouse
evidence
bearing
upon
the
same
object
the
subject
related
in
general
to
trees
and
in
especial
evergreens
while
the
man
was
immersed
in
his
work
he
appeared
not
to
be
submerged
his
left
hand
was
always
going
out
to
one
or
the
other
of
three
on
the
desk
and
his
fingers
bent
caressingly
two
of
these
frames
held
photographs
of
four
young
children
a
boy
and
a
girl
comprising
each
group
the
children
had
the
air
of
being
well
enough
bred
to
be
well
behaved
before
the
camera
but
of
being
unruly
and
disorderly
out
of
sheer
health
and
a
wild
naturalness
all
of
them
looked
straight
at
you
all
had
eyes
wide
open
with
american
frankness
and
good
humor
all
had
mouths
shut
tight
with
american
energy
and
determination
apparently
they
already
believed
that
the
new
world
was
behind
them
that
the
nation
backed
them
up
in
a
way
you
believed
it
you
accepted
them
on
the
spot
as
embodying
that
marvellous
precocity
in
american
children
through
which
they
early
in
life
become
conscious
of
the
country
and
claim
it
their
country
and
believe
that
it
claims
them
thus
they
took
on
the
distinction
of
being
a
squad
detached
only
photographically
from
the
rank
and
file
of
the
white
armies
of
the
young
in
the
new
world
millions
and
millions
strong
as
they
march
joyous
magnificent
toward
new
times
and
new
destinies
for
the
nation
and
for
humanity
a
kinder
knowledge
of
man
and
a
kinder
ignorance
of
god
the
third
frame
held
the
picture
of
a
woman
probably
thirty
years
of
age
her
features
were
without
noticeable
american
characteristics
what
human
traits
you
saw
depended
upon
what
human
traits
you
saw
with
the
hair
was
dark
and
abundant
the
brows
dark
and
strong
and
the
lashes
were
dark
and
strong
and
the
eyes
themselves
so
thornily
hedged
about
somehow
brought
up
before
you
a
picture
of
autumn
thistles
thistles
that
look
out
from
the
shadow
of
a
rock
they
had
a
veritable
thistle
quality
and
suggestiveness
gray
and
of
the
fields
sure
of
their
experience
in
nature
freighted
with
silence
despite
grayness
and
thorniness
however
you
saw
that
they
were
in
the
summer
of
their
and
singularly
above
even
their
beauty
of
blooming
they
held
what
is
rare
in
the
eyes
of
either
men
or
women
they
held
a
look
of
being
just
the
whole
face
was
an
oval
long
regular
if
the
lower
part
had
been
hidden
behind
a
white
veil
of
the
orient
by
that
little
bank
of
snow
which
is
guardedly
built
in
front
of
the
overflowing
desires
of
the
mouth
the
upper
part
would
have
given
the
impression
of
reserve
coldness
possibly
of
severity
yet
ruled
by
that
one
look
the
garnered
wisdom
the
tempering
justice
of
the
eyes
the
whole
face
being
seen
the
lower
features
altered
the
impression
made
by
the
upper
ones
reserve
became
bettered
into
strength
coldness
bettered
into
dignity
severity
of
intellect
transfused
into
glowing
nobleness
of
character
the
look
of
virgin
justice
in
her
was
perhaps
what
had
survived
from
that
white
light
of
life
which
falls
upon
young
children
as
from
a
receding
sun
and
touches
lingeringly
their
smiles
and
glances
but
her
mouth
had
gathered
its
shadowy
tenderness
as
she
walked
the
furrows
of
the
years
watching
their
changeful
harvests
eating
their
passing
bread
a
handful
of
some
of
the
green
things
of
winter
lay
before
her
picture
holly
boughs
with
their
bold
upright
red
berries
a
spray
of
the
cedar
of
the
kentucky
yards
with
its
rosary
of
piteous
blue
when
he
had
come
in
from
out
of
doors
to
go
on
with
his
work
he
had
put
them
there
perhaps
as
some
tribute
after
all
his
years
with
her
many
and
strong
he
must
have
acquired
various
tributes
and
interpretations
but
during
his
walk
in
the
woods
it
had
befallen
him
to
think
of
her
as
holly
which
ripens
amid
snows
and
retains
its
brave
freshness
on
a
landscape
of
departed
things
as
cedar
also
which
everywhere
on
the
shield
is
the
best
loved
of
to
be
the
companion
of
household
walls
so
that
even
the
poorest
of
the
people
if
it
does
not
grow
near
the
spot
they
build
in
hunt
for
it
and
bring
it
home
everywhere
wife
and
cedar
wife
and
cedar
wife
and
cedar
the
photographs
of
the
children
grouped
on
each
side
of
hers
with
heads
a
little
lower
down
called
up
memories
of
old
world
pictures
in
which
cherubs
smile
about
the
feet
of
the
heavenly
hebrew
maid
glowing
young
american
mother
with
four
healthy
children
as
her
gifts
to
the
nation
this
was
the
practical
thought
of
her
that
riveted
and
held
as
has
been
said
they
were
in
two
groups
the
children
a
boy
and
girl
in
each
the
four
were
of
nearly
the
same
age
but
the
faces
of
two
were
on
a
dimmer
card
in
an
older
frame
you
glanced
at
her
again
and
persuaded
yourself
that
the
expression
of
motherhood
which
characterized
her
separated
into
two
expressions
as
behind
a
thin
white
cloud
it
is
possible
to
watch
another
cloud
of
darker
hue
nearer
in
time
was
the
countenance
of
a
mother
happy
with
happy
offspring
further
away
the
same
countenance
withdrawn
a
little
into
shadow
the
face
of
the
mother
bereaved
mute
and
changeless
the
man
the
worker
whom
this
little
flock
of
wife
and
two
surviving
children
now
followed
through
the
world
as
their
leader
sat
with
his
face
toward
his
desk
in
a
corner
of
the
room
solidly
squared
before
his
undertaking
liking
it
mastering
it
seldom
changing
his
position
as
the
minutes
passed
never
nervously
with
a
quietude
in
him
that
was
oftener
in
southern
gentlemen
in
quieter
more
gentlemanly
times
a
low
powerful
figure
with
a
pair
of
thick
shoulders
and
tremendous
limbs
filling
the
room
with
his
vitality
as
a
heavy
passionate
animal
lying
in
a
corner
of
a
cage
fills
the
space
of
the
cage
so
that
you
wait
for
it
to
roll
over
or
get
up
on
its
feet
and
walk
about
that
you
may
study
its
markings
and
get
an
inkling
of
its
conquering
nature
meantime
there
were
hints
of
him
when
he
had
come
in
he
had
thrown
his
overcoat
on
a
chair
that
stood
near
the
table
in
the
centre
of
the
room
and
had
dropped
his
hat
upon
his
coat
it
had
slipped
to
the
floor
and
now
lay
there
a
low
soft
black
hat
of
a
kind
formerly
much
worn
by
young
southerners
of
the
countryside
especially
on
occasions
when
there
was
a
spur
of
heat
in
their
mood
and
going
much
the
same
kind
that
one
sees
on
the
heads
of
students
in
rome
in
winter
light
warm
shaping
itself
readily
to
breezes
from
any
quarter
to
be
doffed
or
donned
as
comfortable
and
negligible
it
suggested
that
he
had
been
a
country
boy
in
the
land
still
belonged
to
the
land
and
as
a
man
kept
to
its
habits
and
fashions
his
shoes
one
of
which
you
saw
at
each
side
of
his
chair
were
especially
well
made
for
feet
to
tramp
in
during
all
weathers
a
sack
suit
of
dark
blue
serge
somehow
helped
to
withdraw
your
interpretation
of
him
from
farm
life
to
the
arts
or
the
professions
the
scrupulous
air
of
his
shirt
collar
showing
against
the
flesh
at
the
back
of
his
neck
and
the
van
edge
of
the
shirt
cuff
defining
his
powerful
wrist
and
hand
strengthened
the
notion
that
he
belonged
to
the
arts
or
to
the
professions
he
might
have
been
sitting
before
a
canvas
instead
of
a
desk
and
holding
a
brush
instead
of
a
pen
the
picture
would
have
been
true
to
life
or
truer
yet
he
might
have
taken
his
place
with
the
grave
group
of
students
in
the
lesson
in
anatomy
left
by
rembrandt
once
he
put
down
his
pen
wheeled
his
chair
about
and
began
to
read
the
page
he
had
just
finished
then
you
saw
him
he
had
a
big
masculine
executive
head
covered
with
thick
yellowish
hair
clipped
short
so
that
while
everything
else
in
his
appearance
indicated
that
he
was
in
the
prime
of
manhood
the
clipped
hair
caused
him
to
appear
still
more
youthful
and
it
invested
him
with
a
rustic
atmosphere
which
went
along
very
naturally
with
the
sentimental
country
hat
and
the
shoes
he
seemed
at
first
impression
a
magnificent
animal
frankly
loved
of
the
sun
perhaps
too
warmly
the
sun
itself
seemed
to
have
colored
for
him
his
beard
and
mustache
a
characteristic
hue
of
men
s
hair
and
beard
in
this
land
peopled
from
old
english
stock
the
beard
like
the
hair
was
cut
short
as
though
his
idea
might
have
been
to
get
both
hair
and
beard
out
of
life
s
daily
way
but
his
mustache
curled
thickly
down
over
his
mouth
hiding
it
in
the
whole
effect
there
was
a
suggestion
of
the
continent
perhaps
of
a
former
student
career
in
germany
memories
of
which
may
still
have
lasted
with
him
and
the
marks
of
which
may
have
purposely
been
kept
up
in
his
appearance
but
such
a
fashion
of
beard
while
covering
a
man
s
face
does
much
to
uncover
the
man
as
he
sat
amid
his
papers
and
books
your
thought
surely
led
again
to
old
pictures
where
earnest
heads
bend
together
over
some
point
on
the
human
road
at
which
knowledge
widens
and
suffering
begins
to
be
made
more
bearable
and
death
more
kind
perforce
now
you
interpreted
him
and
fixed
his
general
working
category
that
he
was
absorbed
in
work
meant
to
be
serviceable
to
humanity
his
house
the
members
of
his
family
the
people
of
his
neighborhood
were
meantime
forgotten
he
was
not
a
mere
dweller
on
his
farm
he
was
a
discoverer
on
the
wide
commons
where
the
race
forever
camps
at
large
with
its
problems
joys
and
sorrows
he
read
his
page
his
hand
dropped
to
his
knee
his
mind
dropped
its
responsibility
one
of
those
intervals
followed
when
the
brain
rests
the
look
of
the
student
left
his
face
over
it
began
to
play
the
soft
lights
of
the
domestic
affections
he
had
forgotten
the
world
for
his
own
place
in
the
world
the
student
had
become
the
husband
and
a
few
moments
only
then
he
wheeled
gravely
to
his
work
again
his
right
hand
took
up
the
pen
his
left
hand
went
back
to
the
pictures
the
silence
of
the
room
seemed
a
guarded
silence
as
though
he
were
being
watched
over
by
a
love
which
would
not
let
him
be
disturbed
he
had
the
reposeful
of
a
man
who
is
conscious
that
he
is
idolized
matching
the
silence
within
was
the
stillness
out
of
doors
an
immense
oak
tree
stood
just
outside
the
windows
it
was
a
perpetual
reminder
of
vanished
woods
and
when
a
windstorm
tossed
and
twisted
it
the
straining
and
grinding
of
the
fibres
were
like
struggles
and
outcries
for
the
wild
life
of
old
this
afternoon
it
brooded
motionless
an
image
of
forest
reflection
once
a
small
sapsucker
circling
the
trunk
and
peering
into
the
crevices
of
the
bark
on
a
level
with
the
windows
uttered
minute
notes
which
penetrated
into
the
room
like
steel
darts
of
sound
a
snowbird
alighted
on
the
glanced
familiarly
in
at
the
man
and
shot
up
its
crest
but
disappointed
perhaps
that
it
was
not
noticed
quoted
its
resigned
gray
phrase
a
phrase
it
had
made
for
itself
to
accompany
the
score
of
gray
whiter
and
flitted
on
billowy
wings
to
a
juniper
at
the
corner
of
the
house
its
turret
against
the
long
javelins
of
the
north
amid
the
stillness
of
nature
outside
and
the
of
a
love
guarding
him
within
the
man
worked
on
a
little
clock
ticked
independently
on
the
parian
marble
mantelpiece
prints
were
propped
against
its
sides
and
face
illustrating
the
use
of
trees
about
ancient
tombs
and
temples
out
of
this
photographic
grove
of
dead
things
the
uncaring
clock
threw
out
upon
the
air
a
living
three
the
fateful
three
that
had
been
measured
for
each
tomb
and
temple
in
its
own
land
and
time
a
knock
regretful
but
positive
was
heard
and
the
door
opening
into
the
hall
was
quietly
pushed
open
a
glow
lit
up
the
student
s
face
though
he
did
not
stop
writing
and
his
voice
while
it
gave
a
welcome
unconsciously
expressed
regret
at
being
disturbed
come
i
am
in
he
lifted
his
heavy
figure
with
instant
courtesy
rather
obsolete
now
and
bowing
to
one
side
sat
down
again
so
i
see
he
said
dipping
his
pen
into
his
ink
since
you
did
not
turn
around
you
would
better
have
said
so
i
it
is
three
o
so
i
you
said
you
would
be
i
am
you
said
you
would
be
i
am
done
nearly
how
nearly
by
afternoon
before
dark
i
have
reached
the
end
but
now
it
is
hard
to
stop
hard
to
let
his
tone
gave
first
place
primary
consideration
to
his
work
the
silence
in
the
room
suddenly
became
charged
when
the
voice
was
heard
again
there
was
constraint
in
it
there
is
something
to
be
done
this
afternoon
before
dark
something
i
have
a
share
in
having
a
share
i
am
interested
being
interested
i
am
prompt
being
prompt
i
am
he
waved
his
hand
over
the
written
sheets
before
him
those
cold
alps
of
learning
and
asked
reproachfully
are
you
not
interested
in
all
this
o
you
of
little
faith
how
can
i
say
o
me
of
little
knowledge
as
the
words
impulsively
escaped
he
heard
a
quick
movement
behind
him
he
widened
out
his
heavy
arms
upon
his
manuscript
and
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
at
her
and
laughed
and
still
smiling
and
holding
his
pen
between
his
fingers
he
turned
and
faced
her
she
had
advanced
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
had
stopped
at
the
chair
on
which
he
had
thrown
his
overcoat
and
hat
she
had
picked
up
the
hat
and
stood
turning
it
and
pushing
its
soft
material
back
into
shape
for
his
head
without
looking
at
him
the
northern
light
of
the
winter
afternoon
entering
through
the
looped
curtains
fell
sidewise
upon
the
woman
of
the
picture
years
had
passed
since
the
picture
had
been
made
there
were
changes
in
her
she
looked
younger
she
had
effaced
the
ravages
of
a
sadder
period
of
her
life
as
human
voyagers
upon
reaching
quiet
port
repair
the
damages
of
wandering
and
storm
even
the
look
of
motherhood
of
the
two
motherhoods
which
so
characterized
her
in
the
photograph
had
disappeared
for
the
present
seeing
her
now
for
the
first
time
one
would
have
said
that
her
whole
mood
and
bearing
made
a
single
declaration
she
was
neither
wife
nor
mother
she
was
a
woman
in
love
with
life
s
youth
with
youth
youth
in
love
with
the
things
that
youth
alone
could
ever
secure
to
her
the
carriage
of
her
beautiful
head
brave
and
buoyant
brought
before
you
a
vision
of
growing
things
in
nature
as
they
move
towards
their
summer
yet
far
away
there
still
was
youth
in
the
round
white
throat
above
the
collar
of
green
velvet
woodland
green
darker
than
the
green
of
the
cloth
she
wore
you
were
glad
she
had
chosen
that
color
because
she
was
going
for
a
walk
with
him
and
green
would
enchain
the
eye
out
on
the
sere
ground
and
under
the
stripped
trees
the
flecklessness
of
her
long
gloves
drew
your
thoughts
to
winter
rather
to
its
one
beauteous
gift
dropped
from
soiled
clouds
a
slender
toque
brought
out
the
keenness
in
the
oval
of
her
face
from
it
rose
one
feather
of
green
shaded
to
coral
at
the
tip
and
there
your
fancy
may
have
cared
to
see
lingering
the
last
radiance
of
skies
he
kept
his
seat
with
his
back
to
the
manuscript
from
which
he
had
repulsed
her
and
his
eyes
swept
loyally
over
her
as
she
waited
though
she
could
scarcely
trust
herself
to
speak
still
less
could
she
endure
the
silence
with
her
face
turned
toward
the
windows
opening
on
the
lawn
she
stretched
out
her
arm
toward
him
and
softly
shook
his
hat
at
him
the
sun
sets
you
remember
how
many
minutes
after
four
she
said
with
no
other
tone
than
that
of
quiet
warning
i
marked
the
minutes
in
the
almanac
for
you
the
other
night
after
the
children
had
gone
to
bed
so
that
you
would
not
forget
you
know
how
short
the
twilights
are
even
when
the
day
is
clear
it
is
cloudy
and
there
will
not
be
any
twilight
the
children
said
they
would
not
be
at
home
until
after
dark
but
they
may
come
sooner
it
may
be
a
trick
they
have
threatened
to
catch
us
this
year
in
one
way
or
another
and
you
know
they
must
not
do
that
not
this
year
there
must
be
one
more
christmas
with
all
its
old
ways
even
if
it
must
be
without
its
old
he
did
not
reply
at
once
and
then
not
relevantly
i
heard
you
he
had
dropped
his
head
forward
and
was
scowling
at
her
from
under
his
brows
with
a
big
beethoven
brooding
scowl
she
did
not
see
for
she
held
her
face
averted
the
silence
in
the
room
again
seemed
charged
and
there
was
greater
constraint
in
her
voice
when
it
was
next
heard
i
had
to
play
you
need
not
have
i
had
to
listen
you
played
loud
i
did
not
know
i
was
playing
loud
i
may
have
been
trying
to
drown
other
sounds
she
admitted
what
other
sounds
his
voice
unexpectedly
became
inquisitorial
it
was
a
frank
thrust
into
the
unknown
discords
what
discords
his
thrust
became
deeper
she
turned
her
head
quickly
and
looked
at
him
a
quiver
passed
across
her
lips
and
in
her
eyes
there
was
noble
anguish
but
nothing
so
arrests
our
speech
when
we
are
tempted
to
betray
hidden
trouble
as
to
find
ourselves
face
to
face
with
a
kind
of
burnished
radiant
happiness
sensitive
eyes
not
more
quickly
close
before
a
blaze
of
sunlight
than
the
shadowy
soul
shuts
her
gates
upon
the
advancing
figure
of
joy
it
was
the
whole
familiar
picture
of
him
now
triumphantly
painted
in
the
harmonies
of
life
masterfully
toned
to
subdue
its
discords
that
drove
her
back
into
herself
when
she
spoke
next
she
had
regained
the
which
under
his
unexpected
attack
she
had
come
near
losing
and
her
words
issued
from
behind
the
closed
gates
as
through
a
crevice
of
the
closed
gates
i
was
reading
one
of
the
new
books
that
came
the
other
day
the
deep
grave
ones
you
sent
for
it
is
written
by
a
deep
grave
german
and
it
is
worked
out
in
the
deep
grave
german
way
the
whole
purpose
of
it
is
to
show
that
any
woman
in
the
life
of
any
man
is
merely
an
incident
she
may
be
this
to
him
she
may
be
that
to
him
for
a
briefer
time
for
a
greater
time
but
all
along
and
in
the
end
at
bottom
she
is
to
him
an
he
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
hers
and
his
smile
slowly
broadened
were
those
the
discords
he
asked
gently
she
did
not
reply
he
turned
in
his
chair
and
looking
over
his
shoulder
at
her
he
raised
his
arm
and
drew
the
point
of
his
pen
across
the
backs
of
a
stack
of
magazines
on
top
of
his
desk
here
is
a
work
he
said
not
written
by
a
german
or
by
any
other
man
but
by
a
woman
whose
race
i
do
not
know
here
is
a
work
the
sole
purpose
of
which
is
to
prove
that
any
man
is
merely
an
incident
in
the
life
of
any
woman
he
may
be
this
to
her
he
may
be
that
to
her
for
a
briefer
time
for
a
greater
time
but
all
along
and
in
the
end
beneath
everything
else
he
is
to
her
an
he
turned
and
confronted
her
not
without
a
gleam
of
humor
in
his
eyes
that
did
not
trouble
me
he
said
tenderly
those
were
not
discords
to
her
eyes
rested
on
his
face
with
inscrutable
searching
she
made
no
comment
his
own
face
grew
grave
after
a
moment
of
debate
with
himself
as
to
whether
he
should
be
forced
to
do
a
thing
he
would
rather
not
do
he
turned
in
his
chair
and
laid
down
his
pen
as
though
separating
himself
from
his
work
then
he
said
in
a
tone
that
ended
playfulness
do
i
not
understand
have
i
not
understood
all
the
time
for
a
year
now
i
have
been
shutting
myself
up
at
spare
hours
in
this
room
and
at
this
work
without
any
explanation
to
you
such
a
thing
never
occurred
before
in
our
lives
you
have
shared
everything
i
have
relied
upon
you
and
i
have
needed
you
and
you
have
never
failed
me
and
this
apparently
has
been
your
reward
to
be
rudely
shut
out
at
last
now
you
come
in
and
i
tell
you
that
the
work
is
done
quite
finished
without
a
word
to
you
about
it
do
i
not
understand
he
repeated
have
i
not
understood
all
along
it
is
true
outwardly
as
regards
this
work
you
have
been
the
as
he
paused
she
made
a
slight
gesture
with
one
hand
as
though
she
did
not
care
for
what
he
was
saying
and
brushed
away
the
fragile
web
of
his
words
from
before
her
eyes
eyes
fixed
on
larger
things
lying
clear
before
her
in
life
s
distance
he
went
quickly
on
with
deepening
emphasis
but
comrade
of
all
these
years
battler
with
me
for
life
s
victories
did
you
think
you
were
never
to
know
did
you
believe
i
was
never
to
explain
you
had
only
one
more
day
to
wait
if
patience
if
faith
could
only
have
lasted
another
hours
until
christmas
eve
it
was
the
first
time
for
nearly
a
year
that
the
sound
of
those
words
had
been
heard
in
that
house
he
bent
earnestly
over
toward
her
he
leaned
heavily
forward
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
and
searched
her
features
with
loyal
chiding
has
not
christmas
eve
its
mysteries
he
asked
its
secrets
for
you
and
me
think
of
christmas
eve
for
you
and
me
remember
slowly
as
in
a
windless
woods
on
a
winter
day
a
smoke
from
a
woodchopper
s
smouldering
fire
will
wander
off
and
wind
itself
about
the
hidden
of
a
young
tree
muffling
it
while
the
atmosphere
near
by
is
clear
there
now
floated
into
the
room
to
her
the
tender
haze
of
old
pledges
and
vows
and
of
things
unutterably
sacred
he
noted
the
effect
of
his
words
and
did
not
wait
he
turned
to
his
desk
and
gathering
up
the
sprigs
of
holly
and
cedar
began
softly
to
cover
her
picture
with
them
stay
blinded
and
bewildered
there
he
said
until
the
hour
comes
when
holly
and
cedar
will
speak
on
christmas
eve
you
will
understand
you
will
then
see
whether
in
this
work
you
have
been
the
even
while
they
had
been
talking
the
light
of
the
short
winter
afternoon
had
perceptibly
waned
in
the
room
she
glanced
through
the
windows
at
the
darkening
lawn
her
eyes
were
to
her
it
looked
darker
than
it
was
she
held
his
hat
up
between
her
arms
making
an
arch
for
him
to
come
and
stand
under
it
is
getting
late
she
said
in
nearly
the
same
tone
of
quiet
warning
with
which
she
had
spoken
before
there
is
no
time
to
he
sprang
up
without
glancing
behind
him
at
his
desk
with
its
interrupted
work
and
came
over
and
placed
himself
under
the
arch
of
her
arms
looking
at
her
reverently
but
his
hands
did
not
take
hold
his
arms
hung
down
at
his
sides
the
hands
that
were
life
the
arms
that
were
love
she
let
her
eyes
wander
over
his
clipped
tawny
hair
and
pass
downward
over
his
features
to
the
mouth
under
its
mustache
then
closing
her
quivering
lips
quickly
she
dropped
the
hat
softly
on
his
head
and
walked
toward
the
door
when
she
reached
it
she
put
out
one
of
her
hands
delicately
against
a
panel
and
turned
her
profile
over
her
shoulder
to
him
do
you
know
what
is
the
trouble
with
both
of
those
books
she
asked
with
a
struggling
sweetness
in
her
voice
he
had
caught
up
his
overcoat
and
as
he
put
one
arm
through
the
sleeve
with
a
vigorous
thrust
he
laughed
out
with
his
mouth
behind
the
collar
i
think
i
know
what
is
the
trouble
with
the
authors
of
the
the
trouble
is
she
replied
the
trouble
is
that
the
authors
are
right
and
the
books
are
right
men
and
women
only
incidents
to
each
other
in
life
and
she
passed
out
into
the
hall
human
life
itself
for
that
matter
is
only
an
incident
in
the
universe
he
replied
if
we
cared
to
look
at
it
in
that
way
but
we
d
better
not
he
was
standing
near
the
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
he
suddenly
stopped
buttoning
his
overcoat
his
eyes
began
to
wander
over
the
books
the
prints
the
pictures
embracing
in
a
final
survey
everything
that
he
had
brought
together
from
such
distances
of
place
and
time
his
work
was
in
effect
done
a
sense
of
regret
a
rush
of
loneliness
came
over
him
as
it
comes
upon
all
of
us
who
reach
the
happy
ending
of
toil
that
we
have
put
our
heart
and
strength
in
are
you
coming
she
called
faintly
from
the
hall
i
am
coming
he
replied
and
moved
toward
the
door
but
there
he
stopped
again
and
looked
back
once
more
there
came
into
his
face
the
devotion
of
the
student
he
was
on
the
commons
where
the
race
encamps
he
was
brother
to
all
brothers
who
join
work
to
work
for
common
good
he
was
feeling
for
the
moment
that
through
his
hands
ran
the
long
rope
of
the
world
at
which
men
like
a
crew
of
sailors
tug
at
the
ship
of
life
trying
to
tow
her
into
some
divine
haven
his
task
was
ended
would
it
be
of
service
would
it
carry
any
message
would
it
kindle
in
american
homes
some
new
light
of
truth
with
the
eyes
of
mothers
and
fathers
fixed
upon
it
and
innumerable
children
of
the
future
the
better
for
its
shining
are
you
coming
she
called
more
quiveringly
i
am
coming
he
called
back
breaking
away
from
his
revery
and
raising
his
voice
so
it
would
surely
reach
her
ii
the
tree
and
the
sunset
she
had
quitted
the
house
and
having
taken
a
few
steps
across
the
short
frozen
grass
of
the
yard
as
one
walks
lingeringly
when
expecting
to
be
joined
by
a
companion
she
turned
and
stood
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
doorway
for
his
emerging
figure
night
he
had
said
smiling
at
her
with
one
meaning
in
his
words
night
you
will
yes
she
now
said
to
herself
with
another
meaning
in
hers
night
i
must
understand
until
night
then
blinded
and
bewildered
with
holly
and
cedar
let
me
be
kind
ignorance
enfold
me
and
spare
me
all
happiness
that
i
can
control
or
conjecture
come
to
me
and
console
me
and
over
herself
she
dropped
a
vesture
of
joy
to
greet
him
when
he
should
step
forth
it
was
a
pleasant
afternoon
to
be
out
of
doors
and
to
go
about
what
they
had
planned
the
ground
was
scarcely
frozen
there
was
no
wind
and
the
whole
sky
was
overcast
with
thin
gray
cloud
that
betrayed
no
movement
under
this
still
dome
of
light
stretched
the
winter
land
it
seemed
ready
and
waiting
for
its
great
festival
the
lawn
sloped
away
from
the
house
to
a
brook
at
the
bottom
and
beyond
the
brook
the
ground
rose
to
a
woodland
hilltop
across
the
distance
you
distinguished
there
the
familiar
trees
of
pastures
white
ash
and
black
ash
white
oak
and
red
oak
white
walnut
and
black
walnut
and
the
hickory
in
his
roughness
and
the
sycamore
with
her
soft
leoparded
limbs
the
black
walnut
and
the
hickory
brought
to
mind
autumn
days
when
children
were
abroad
ploughing
the
myriad
leaves
with
booted
feet
and
gathering
their
harvest
of
nuts
primitive
instinct
of
the
human
animal
still
rampant
in
modern
childhood
these
nuts
to
be
put
away
in
garret
and
cellar
and
but
scantily
eaten
until
christmas
came
out
of
this
woods
on
the
afternoon
air
sounded
the
muffled
strokes
of
an
axe
cutting
down
a
black
walnut
partly
dead
and
when
this
fell
it
would
bring
down
with
it
bunches
of
mistletoe
those
white
pearls
of
the
forest
mounted
on
branching
jade
eager
fingers
would
be
gathering
the
mistletoe
to
decorate
the
house
near
by
was
a
thicket
of
bramble
and
cane
where
out
of
reach
of
cattle
bushes
of
holly
thrived
the
same
fingers
would
be
gathering
that
bordering
this
woods
on
one
side
lay
a
cornfield
the
corn
had
just
been
shucked
and
beside
each
shock
of
fodder
lay
its
heap
of
ears
ready
for
the
gathering
wagon
the
sight
of
the
corn
brought
freshly
to
remembrance
the
of
the
land
which
runs
in
a
genial
torrent
through
all
days
and
nights
of
the
year
many
a
rill
but
never
with
so
inundating
a
movement
as
at
this
season
and
the
same
grain
suggested
also
the
smokehouses
of
all
farms
in
which
larded
porkers
fattened
by
it
had
taken
on
posthumous
honors
as
hams
and
in
which
up
under
the
black
rafters
sausages
were
being
smoked
to
their
needed
flavor
over
chips
around
one
heap
of
ears
a
flock
of
turkeys
were
feeding
for
their
fate
on
the
other
side
of
the
woods
stretched
a
in
the
stubble
of
which
coveys
of
were
giving
themselves
final
plumpness
for
the
table
by
picking
up
grains
of
wheat
which
had
dropped
into
the
drills
at
harvest
time
or
other
seeds
which
had
ripened
in
the
autumn
aftermath
farther
away
on
the
landscape
there
was
a
where
were
making
a
rattling
reedy
music
during
these
weeks
wagons
loaded
with
the
fibre
begin
to
move
creaking
to
the
towns
helping
to
fill
the
farmer
s
pockets
with
holiday
largess
thus
everything
needed
for
christmas
was
there
in
sight
the
mistletoe
the
holly
the
liquor
of
the
land
for
the
cups
of
hearty
men
the
hams
and
the
sausages
of
fastidious
housewives
the
turkey
and
the
quail
and
crops
transmutable
into
coin
they
were
in
sight
there
the
fair
maturings
of
the
sun
now
ready
to
be
turned
into
offerings
to
the
dark
solstice
the
low
activities
of
the
soil
uplifted
to
human
joyance
one
last
thing
completed
the
picture
of
the
scene
the
brook
that
wound
across
the
lawn
at
its
bottom
was
frozen
and
lay
like
a
band
of
jewelled
samite
trailed
through
the
olive
verdure
along
its
margin
evergreens
grew
no
pine
nor
spruce
nor
larch
nor
fir
is
native
to
these
portions
of
the
shield
only
the
wild
cedar
the
shapeless
and
the
shapely
belongs
there
this
assemblage
of
evergreens
was
not
then
one
of
the
bounties
of
nature
they
had
been
planted
it
was
the
slender
tapering
spires
of
these
evergreens
with
their
note
of
deathless
spring
that
mainly
caught
the
eye
on
the
whole
landscape
this
dead
winter
day
under
the
light
of
the
sky
they
waited
in
beauty
and
in
peace
the
pale
green
of
larch
and
spruce
which
seems
always
to
go
with
the
freshness
of
dripping
aprils
the
dim
of
pines
which
rather
belongs
to
summer
skies
and
the
dark
green
of
firs
true
comfortable
winter
coat
when
snows
sift
mournfully
and
icicles
are
spearing
earthward
these
evergreens
likewise
had
their
christmas
meaning
and
finished
the
picture
of
the
giving
earth
unlike
the
other
things
they
satisfied
no
appetite
they
were
ministers
to
no
passions
but
with
them
the
christmas
of
the
intellect
began
the
human
heart
was
to
drape
their
boughs
with
its
gentle
poetry
and
from
their
ever
living
spires
the
spiritual
hope
of
humanity
would
take
its
flight
toward
the
eternal
thus
then
the
winter
land
waited
for
the
oncoming
of
that
strange
travelling
festival
of
the
world
which
has
roved
into
it
and
encamped
from
old
lost
countries
the
festival
that
takes
toll
of
field
and
wood
of
hoof
and
wing
of
cup
and
loaf
but
that
best
of
all
wrings
from
the
nature
of
man
its
reluctant
tenderness
for
his
fellows
and
builds
out
of
his
lonely
doubts
regarding
this
life
his
faith
in
a
better
one
and
central
on
this
whole
silent
scene
the
highest
element
in
it
its
one
passion
flower
the
motionless
woman
waiting
outside
the
house
at
last
he
came
out
upon
the
step
he
cast
a
quick
glance
toward
the
sky
as
though
his
first
thought
were
of
what
the
weather
was
going
to
be
then
as
he
buttoned
the
top
button
of
his
overcoat
and
pressed
his
bearded
chin
down
over
it
to
make
it
more
comfortable
under
his
short
neck
with
his
other
hand
he
gave
a
little
pull
at
his
hat
the
romantic
country
hat
and
he
peeped
out
from
under
the
rustic
brim
at
her
smiling
with
old
gayeties
and
old
fondnesses
he
bulked
so
rotund
inside
his
overcoat
and
looked
so
short
under
the
flat
headgear
that
her
first
thought
was
how
slight
a
disguise
every
year
turned
him
into
a
good
family
santa
claus
and
she
smiled
back
at
him
with
the
same
gayeties
and
fondnesses
of
days
gone
by
but
such
a
deeper
pang
pierced
her
that
she
turned
away
and
walked
hurriedly
down
the
hill
toward
the
evergreens
he
was
quickly
at
her
side
she
could
feel
how
animal
youth
in
him
released
itself
the
moment
he
had
come
into
the
open
air
there
was
brutal
vitality
in
the
way
his
shoes
crushed
the
frozen
ground
and
as
his
overcoat
sleeve
rubbed
against
her
arm
there
was
the
same
leaping
out
of
life
like
the
rubbing
of
tinder
against
tinder
halfway
down
the
lawn
he
halted
and
laid
his
hand
heavily
on
her
wrist
listen
to
that
he
said
his
voice
was
eager
excited
like
a
boy
s
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
house
several
hundred
yards
away
the
country
turnpike
ran
and
from
this
there
now
reached
them
the
rumbling
of
many
vehicles
hurrying
in
close
procession
out
of
the
nearest
town
and
moving
toward
smaller
villages
scattered
over
the
country
to
its
hamlets
and
and
hundreds
of
homes
richer
or
poorer
every
vehicle
sign
and
foretoken
of
the
southern
there
were
matters
and
usages
in
those
american
carriages
and
buggies
and
wagons
and
carts
the
history
of
which
went
back
to
the
england
of
the
georges
and
the
stuarts
and
the
henrys
to
the
england
of
elizabeth
to
the
england
of
chaucer
back
through
robuster
saxon
times
to
the
gaunt
england
of
alfred
and
on
beyond
this
till
they
were
lost
under
the
forest
glooms
of
druidical
britain
they
stood
looking
into
each
other
s
eyes
and
gathering
into
their
ears
the
festal
uproar
of
the
turnpike
how
well
they
knew
what
it
all
meant
this
tide
of
bounteousness
how
perfectly
they
saw
the
whole
picture
of
the
town
out
of
which
the
vehicles
had
come
the
atmosphere
of
it
already
darkened
by
the
smoke
of
soft
coal
pouring
from
its
chimneys
so
that
twilight
in
it
had
already
begun
to
fall
ahead
of
twilight
out
in
the
country
and
to
glimmer
along
the
little
streets
and
shops
to
be
illuminated
to
the
delight
of
children
wild
with
their
holiday
excitements
and
secrecies
somewhere
in
the
throng
their
own
two
children
were
busy
unless
they
had
already
started
home
for
years
he
had
held
a
professorship
in
the
college
in
this
town
driving
in
and
out
from
his
home
but
with
the
close
of
this
academic
year
he
was
to
join
the
slender
file
of
southern
men
who
have
been
called
to
northern
universities
this
change
would
mean
the
end
of
life
here
both
thought
of
this
now
of
the
last
christmas
in
the
house
and
with
the
same
impulse
they
turned
their
gaze
back
to
it
more
than
half
a
century
ago
the
one
starved
genius
of
the
shield
a
writer
of
songs
looked
out
upon
the
summer
picture
of
this
land
its
meadows
and
ripening
corn
tops
and
as
one
presses
out
the
spirit
of
an
entire
vineyard
when
he
bursts
a
solitary
grape
upon
his
tongue
he
the
song
writer
drained
drop
by
drop
the
wine
of
that
scene
into
the
notes
of
a
single
melody
the
nation
now
knows
his
song
the
world
knows
it
the
only
music
that
has
ever
captured
the
joy
and
peace
of
american
home
life
embodying
the
very
soul
of
it
in
the
clear
amber
of
sound
this
house
was
one
of
such
homesteads
as
the
genius
sang
of
a
low
house
with
chimneys
generous
with
green
less
than
green
and
white
less
than
white
with
feudal
vines
giving
to
its
walls
their
summery
allegiance
not
young
not
old
but
standing
in
the
middle
years
of
its
strength
and
its
honors
not
needy
not
wealthy
but
answering
agar
s
prayer
for
neither
poverty
nor
riches
the
two
stood
on
the
darkening
lawn
looking
back
at
it
it
had
been
the
house
of
his
fathers
he
had
brought
her
to
it
as
his
own
on
the
afternoon
of
their
wedding
several
miles
away
across
the
country
they
had
arrived
at
dark
and
as
she
had
sat
beside
him
in
the
carriage
one
of
his
arms
around
her
and
his
other
hand
enfolding
both
of
hers
she
had
first
caught
sight
of
it
through
the
forest
trees
waiting
for
her
with
its
lights
just
lit
its
warmth
its
privacies
and
that
had
been
christmas
eve
for
her
wedding
day
had
been
christmas
eve
when
she
had
announced
her
choice
of
a
day
they
had
chidden
her
but
with
girlish
wilfulness
she
had
clung
to
it
the
more
positively
it
is
the
most
beautiful
night
of
the
year
she
had
replied
brushing
their
objection
aside
with
that
reason
alone
and
it
is
the
happiest
i
will
be
married
on
that
night
when
i
am
happiest
alone
and
thinking
it
over
she
had
uttered
other
words
to
herself
yet
scarce
uttered
them
rather
felt
them
of
old
it
was
written
how
on
christmas
night
the
love
that
can
not
fail
us
became
human
my
love
for
him
which
is
the
divine
thing
in
my
life
and
which
is
never
to
fail
him
shall
become
human
to
him
on
that
when
the
carriage
had
stopped
at
the
front
porch
he
had
led
her
into
the
house
between
the
proud
smiling
servants
of
his
establishment
ranged
at
a
respectful
distance
on
each
side
and
without
surrendering
her
even
to
her
maid
a
new
spirit
of
silence
on
him
he
had
led
her
to
her
bedroom
to
a
place
on
the
carpet
under
the
chandelier
leaving
her
there
he
had
stepped
backward
and
surveyed
her
waiting
in
her
youth
and
loveliness
him
come
into
his
house
into
his
arms
no
other
s
never
while
life
lasted
to
be
another
s
even
in
thought
or
in
desire
then
as
if
the
marriage
ceremony
of
the
afternoon
in
the
presence
of
many
had
meant
nothing
and
this
were
the
first
moment
when
he
could
gather
her
home
to
him
he
had
come
forward
and
taken
her
in
his
arms
and
set
upon
her
the
kiss
of
his
house
and
his
ardor
and
his
duty
as
his
warm
breath
broke
close
against
her
face
his
lips
under
their
mustache
almost
boyish
then
had
thoughtlessly
formed
one
little
phrase
one
little
but
most
lasting
and
fateful
phrase
of
the
looking
up
with
a
smile
she
saw
that
she
stood
under
a
bunch
of
mistletoe
swung
from
the
chandelier
straightway
he
had
forgotten
his
own
words
nor
did
he
ever
afterwards
know
that
he
had
used
them
but
she
out
of
their
very
sacredness
as
the
first
words
he
had
spoken
to
her
in
his
home
had
remembered
them
most
clingingly
more
than
remembered
them
she
had
set
them
to
grow
down
into
the
fibres
of
her
heart
as
the
mistletoe
roots
itself
upon
the
of
the
tree
and
in
all
the
later
years
they
had
been
the
green
spot
of
verdure
under
life
s
dark
skies
the
undying
bough
into
which
the
spirit
of
the
whole
tree
retreats
from
the
ice
of
the
world
of
the
mistletoe
through
the
first
problem
of
learning
to
weld
her
nature
to
his
wisely
through
the
perils
of
bearing
children
and
the
agony
of
seeing
some
of
them
pass
away
through
the
ambition
of
having
him
rise
in
his
profession
and
through
the
ideal
of
making
his
home
an
earthly
paradise
through
loneliness
when
he
was
away
and
joy
whenever
he
came
back
upon
her
whole
life
had
rested
the
wintry
benediction
of
that
mystical
phrase
of
the
mistletoe
she
turned
away
now
starting
once
more
downward
toward
the
evergreens
he
was
quickly
at
her
side
what
do
you
suppose
harold
and
elizabeth
are
up
to
about
this
time
he
asked
with
a
jerk
of
his
head
toward
the
distant
town
at
least
to
something
mischievous
whatever
it
is
she
replied
they
begged
to
be
allowed
to
stay
until
the
shop
windows
were
lighted
they
have
seen
the
shop
windows
two
or
three
times
already
this
week
there
is
no
great
marvel
for
them
now
in
shop
windows
permission
to
stay
late
may
be
a
blind
to
come
home
early
they
are
determined
from
what
i
have
overheard
to
put
an
end
this
year
to
the
parental
house
mysteries
of
christmas
they
are
crossing
the
boundary
between
the
first
childhood
and
the
second
but
if
it
be
possible
i
wish
everything
to
be
kept
once
more
just
as
it
has
always
been
let
it
be
so
for
my
sake
and
i
wish
it
for
your
sake
he
replied
heartily
and
for
my
after
a
moment
of
silence
he
asked
how
large
a
tree
must
it
be
this
year
it
will
have
to
be
large
she
replied
and
she
began
to
count
those
for
whom
the
tree
this
year
was
meant
first
she
called
the
names
of
the
two
children
they
had
lost
gifts
for
these
were
every
year
hung
on
the
boughs
she
mentioned
their
names
now
and
then
she
continued
counting
harold
and
elizabeth
are
four
you
and
i
make
six
after
the
family
come
herbert
and
elsie
your
best
friend

other

who

accepted
ten

the
ten

bring
with
them
some
unimportant
parents
you
can
that
will
do
for
size
he
said
laughing
now
the
kind
spruce
larch
hemlock
pine
which
shall
it
be
it
shall
be
none
of
them
she
answered
after
a
little
waiting
it
shall
be
the
christmas
tree
of
the
uttermost
north
where
the
reindeer
are
harnessed
and
the
great
white
sleigh
starts
fir
the
old
christmas
stories
like
fir
best
old
faiths
seem
to
lodge
in
it
longest
and
deepest
mystery
darkens
the
heart
of
it
she
added
fir
it
shall
be
he
said
choose
the
i
have
she
stopped
and
delicately
touched
his
wrist
with
the
finger
tips
of
one
hand
bidding
him
stand
beside
her
that
one
she
said
pointing
down
the
brook
watering
the
roots
of
the
evergreens
in
summer
gratefully
but
now
lying
like
a
band
of
samite
made
a
loop
near
the
middle
point
of
the
lawn
creating
a
tiny
island
and
on
this
island
aloof
from
its
fellows
and
with
space
for
the
growth
of
its
boughs
stood
a
perfect
fir
tree
tapering
faultlessly
gathering
more
youth
as
it
gathered
more
years
a
tame
dweller
on
the
lawn
but
descended
from
forests
blurred
with
wildness
and
lapped
by
low
washings
of
the
planet
s
primeval
ocean
at
each
christmas
for
several
years
they
had
been
tempted
to
cut
this
tree
but
had
spared
it
for
its
conspicuous
beauty
at
the
edge
of
the
thicket
that
one
she
now
said
pointing
down
this
is
the
last
time
let
us
have
the
best
of
things
while
we
may
is
it
not
always
the
perfect
that
is
demanded
for
sacrifice
his
glance
had
already
gone
forward
eagerly
to
the
tree
and
he
started
toward
it
descending
they
stepped
across
the
brook
to
the
island
and
went
up
close
to
the
fir
with
a
movement
not
unobserved
by
her
he
held
out
his
hand
and
clasped
three
green
fingers
of
a
low
bough
which
the
fir
seemed
to
stretch
out
to
him
recognizingly
she
had
always
realized
the
existence
of
some
intimate
bond
between
him
and
the
forest
his
face
now
filled
with
meanings
she
did
not
share
the
spell
of
the
secret
work
had
followed
him
out
of
the
house
down
to
the
trees
incommunicable
silence
shut
him
in
a
moment
later
his
fingers
parted
with
the
green
fingers
of
the
fir
and
he
moved
away
from
her
side
starting
around
the
tree
and
studying
it
as
though
in
delight
of
fresh
knowledge
so
she
watched
him
pass
around
to
the
other
side
when
he
came
back
where
he
had
started
she
was
not
there
he
looked
around
searchingly
her
figure
was
nowhere
in
sight
he
stood
waiting
the
valley
had
memories
what
memories
the
years
came
close
together
here
they
clustered
as
thickly
as
the
trees
themselves
vacant
spots
among
them
marked
where
the
christmas
trees
of
former
years
had
been
cut
down
some
of
the
trees
had
been
for
the
two
children
they
had
lost
this
wandering
trail
led
hither
and
thither
back
to
the
first
tree
for
the
first
child
he
had
stooped
down
and
cut
that
close
to
the
ground
with
his
mere
penknife
when
it
had
been
lighted
it
had
held
only
two
or
three
candles
and
the
candle
on
the
top
of
it
had
flared
level
into
the
infant
s
eyes
he
knew
that
she
was
making
through
the
evergreens
a
pilgrimage
of
the
years
walking
there
softly
and
alone
with
the
feet
of
life
s
pities
and
a
mother
s
constancies
he
waited
for
her
motionless
the
stillness
of
the
twilight
rested
on
the
valley
now
only
from
the
trees
came
the
plaintive
twittering
of
birds
which
had
come
in
from
frozen
weeds
and
and
at
the
thresholds
of
the
boughs
were
calling
to
one
another
it
was
not
their
song
but
their
speech
there
was
no
love
in
it
but
there
was
what
for
them
perhaps
corresponds
to
our
sense
of
ties
it
most
resembled
in
human
life
the
brief
things
that
two
people
having
long
lived
together
utter
to
each
other
when
together
in
a
room
they
prepare
for
the
night
there
is
no
anticipation
it
is
a
confession
of
the
unconfessed
about
him
now
sounded
this
low
winter
music
from
the
far
boundary
of
other
lives
he
did
not
hear
it
the
light
on
the
landscape
had
changed
the
sun
was
setting
and
a
splendor
began
to
spread
along
the
sky
and
across
the
land
it
laid
a
glory
on
the
roof
of
the
house
on
the
hill
it
smote
the
edge
of
the
woodland
pasture
burnishing
with
copper
the
gray
domes
it
shone
faintly
on
distant
corn
shocks
on
the
tents
of
the
hemp
at
bivouac
soldierly
and
grim
at
his
feet
it
sparkled
in
rose
gleams
on
the
samite
of
the
brook
and
threw
burning
shafts
into
the
gloom
of
the
fir
beside
him
he
did
not
see
it
he
did
not
hear
the
calling
of
the
birds
about
his
ears
he
did
not
see
the
sunset
before
his
eyes
he
did
not
feel
the
fir
tree
the
boughs
of
which
stuck
against
his
side
he
stood
there
as
still
as
a
rock
with
his
secret
not
the
secret
of
the
year
s
work
which
was
to
be
divulged
to
his
wife
and
through
her
to
the
world
but
the
secret
which
for
some
years
had
been
growing
in
his
life
and
which
would
he
hoped
never
grow
into
the
open
to
be
seen
of
her
and
of
all
men
the
sentimental
country
hat
now
looked
as
though
it
might
have
been
worn
purposely
to
help
out
a
disguise
as
the
more
troubled
man
behind
the
scenes
makes
up
to
be
the
happier
clown
it
became
an
absurdity
a
mockery
above
his
face
grave
stern
set
of
jaw
and
eye
he
was
no
longer
the
student
buried
among
his
books
nor
human
brother
to
toiling
brothers
he
had
not
the
slightest
thought
of
service
to
mankind
left
in
him
he
was
but
a
man
himself
with
enough
to
think
of
in
the
battle
between
his
own
will
and
blood
and
behind
him
among
the
dark
evergreens
went
on
that
pilgrimage
of
the
years
with
the
feet
of
the
pities
and
the
constancies
moments
passed
he
did
not
stir
then
there
was
a
slight
noise
on
the
other
side
of
the
tree
and
his
nature
instantly
stepped
back
into
his
outward
place
he
looked
through
the
boughs
she
had
returned
and
was
standing
with
her
face
also
turned
toward
the
sunset
it
was
very
pale
very
still
such
darkness
had
settled
on
the
valley
now
that
the
green
she
wore
blent
with
the
green
of
the
fir
he
saw
only
her
white
face
and
her
white
hands
so
close
to
the
branches
that
they
appeared
to
rest
upon
them
to
grow
out
of
them
he
sadly
thought
of
one
of
his
prints
of
egypt
of
old
and
of
the
lady
of
the
sacred
tree
her
long
plume
of
green
also
blent
with
the
green
of
the
fir
shade
to
shade
and
only
the
coral
tip
of
it
remained
strongly
visible
this
matched
the
last
coral
in
the
sunset
and
it
seemed
to
rest
ominously
above
her
head
as
a
of
the
fading
light
of
nature
he
went
quickly
around
to
her
he
locked
his
arms
around
her
and
drew
her
close
and
held
her
close
and
thus
for
a
while
the
two
stood
watching
the
flame
on
the
altar
of
the
world
as
it
sank
lower
leaving
emptiness
and
ashes
once
she
put
out
a
hand
and
with
a
gesture
full
of
majesty
and
nobleness
waved
farewell
to
the
dying
fire
still
without
a
word
he
took
his
arms
from
around
her
and
turned
energetically
to
the
tree
he
pressed
the
lowest
boughs
aside
and
made
his
way
in
close
to
the
trunk
and
struck
it
with
a
keen
stroke
the
fir
as
he
drew
the
axe
out
made
at
its
gashed
throat
a
sound
like
that
of
a
butchered
creature
trying
to
cry
out
too
late
against
a
treachery
a
horror
ran
through
the
boughs
the
thousands
of
leaves
were
jarred
by
the
and
the
top
of
it
rocked
like
a
splendid
plume
too
rudely
treated
in
a
storm
then
it
fell
over
on
its
side
bridging
blackly
the
white
ice
of
the
brook
stooping
he
lifted
it
triumphantly
he
set
the
on
one
of
his
shoulders
and
stretching
his
arms
up
grasped
the
trunk
and
held
the
tree
straight
in
the
air
so
that
it
seemed
to
be
growing
out
of
his
big
shoulder
as
out
of
a
ledge
of
rock
then
he
turned
to
her
and
laughed
out
in
his
strength
and
youth
she
laughed
joyously
back
at
him
glorying
as
he
did
with
a
robust
of
the
tree
to
make
it
more
comfortable
to
carry
he
turned
and
started
up
the
hill
toward
the
house
as
she
followed
behind
the
old
mystery
of
the
woods
seemed
at
last
to
have
taken
bodily
possession
of
him
the
fir
was
riding
on
his
shoulder
its
arms
met
fondly
around
his
neck
its
fingers
were
caressing
his
hair
and
it
whispered
back
jeeringly
to
her
through
the
twilight
say
farewell
to
him
he
was
once
yours
he
is
yours
no
longer
he
dandles
the
child
of
the
forest
on
his
shoulder
instead
of
his
children
by
you
in
the
house
he
belongs
to
nature
and
as
nature
calls
he
will
always
follow
though
it
should
lead
over
the
precipice
or
into
the
flood
once
nature
called
him
to
you
remember
how
he
broke
down
barriers
until
he
won
you
now
he
is
yours
no
longer
say
to
him
with
an
imbued
terror
and
desolation
she
caught
up
with
him
by
a
movement
so
soft
that
he
should
not
be
aware
she
plucked
him
by
the
coat
sleeve
on
the
other
side
from
the
fir
and
held
on
to
him
as
he
strode
on
in
careless
joy
halfway
up
the
hill
lights
began
to
flash
from
the
windows
of
the
house
a
servant
was
bringing
in
the
lamps
it
was
at
this
hour
in
just
this
way
that
she
had
first
caught
sight
of
them
on
that
christmas
eve
when
he
had
brought
her
home
after
the
wedding
she
hurried
around
in
front
of
him
wishing
to
read
the
expression
of
his
eyes
by
the
distant
gleams
from
the
windows
would
they
have
nothing
to
say
to
her
about
those
winter
twilight
lamps
did
he
too
not
remember
his
head
and
face
were
hidden
a
thousand
small
spears
of
nature
bristled
between
him
and
her
but
he
laughed
out
to
her
from
behind
the
rampart
of
the
green
spears
at
that
moment
a
low
sound
in
the
distance
drew
her
attention
and
instantly
alert
she
paused
to
listen
then
forgetting
everything
else
she
called
to
him
with
a
rush
of
laughter
like
that
of
her
girlhood
quick
there
they
are
i
heard
the
gate
shut
at
the
turnpike
they
must
not
catch
us
quick
quick
hurry
then
he
cried
as
he
ran
forward
joining
his
laughter
to
hers
open
the
door
for
me
after
this
the
night
fell
fast
the
only
sounds
to
be
heard
in
the
valley
were
the
minute
readjustments
of
the
ice
of
the
brook
as
it
froze
tighter
and
the
distressed
cries
of
the
birds
that
had
roosted
in
the
fir
so
the
tree
entered
the
house
iii
the
lighting
of
the
candles
during
the
night
it
turned
bitter
cold
when
morning
came
the
sky
was
a
turquoise
and
the
wind
a
gale
the
sun
seemed
to
give
out
light
but
not
heat
to
lavish
its
splendor
but
withhold
its
charity
moist
flesh
if
it
chanced
to
touch
iron
froze
to
it
momentarily
so
in
whiter
land
the
tongue
of
the
ermine
freezes
to
the
piece
of
greased
metal
used
as
a
trap
and
is
caught
and
held
there
until
the
trapper
returns
or
until
it
starves
starves
with
food
on
its
tongue
the
ground
wherever
the
stiff
boots
of
a
farmhand
struck
it
resisted
as
rock
in
the
fetlocks
of
farm
horses
as
they
moved
shivering
balls
of
ice
rattled
like
shaken
tacks
the
little
roughnesses
of
woodland
paths
snapped
off
beneath
the
hoofs
of
cattle
like
points
of
glass
within
their
wool
the
sheep
were
comforted
on
higher
fields
which
had
given
back
their
moisture
to
the
atmosphere
and
now
were
dry
the
swooping
wind
lifted
the
dust
at
intervals
and
dragged
it
away
in
flaunting
yellow
veils
the
picture
it
made
being
so
led
you
to
think
of
august
drought
when
the
grasshopper
stills
itself
in
the
weeds
and
the
smell
of
grass
is
hot
in
the
nostrils
and
every
bird
holds
its
beak
open
and
its
wings
lifted
like
cooling
lattices
alongside
its
breast
in
these
veils
of
dust
swarms
of
frost
crystals
sported
dead
midgets
of
the
dead
north
except
crystal
and
dust
and
wind
naught
moved
out
there
no
field
mouse
no
hare
nor
lark
nor
little
shielded
dove
in
the
naked
trees
of
the
pasture
the
crow
kept
his
beak
as
unseen
as
the
owl
s
about
the
cedars
of
the
yard
no
scarlet
feather
warmed
the
day
the
house
on
the
hill
one
of
the
houses
whose
spirit
had
been
blown
into
the
amber
of
the
poet
s
song
sent
festal
smoke
out
of
its
chimneys
all
day
long
at
intervals
the
radiant
faces
of
children
appeared
at
the
windows
hanging
wreaths
of
evergreens
or
their
figures
flitted
to
and
fro
within
as
they
wove
garlands
on
the
walls
for
the
christmas
party
at
intervals
some
servant
with
head
and
shoulders
muffled
in
a
shawl
darted
trippingly
from
the
house
to
the
cabins
in
the
yard
and
from
the
cabins
back
to
the
house
the
tropical
african
s
polar
dance
between
fire
and
fire
by
every
sign
it
gave
the
house
showed
that
it
was
marshalling
its
whole
happiness
one
thing
only
seemed
to
make
a
signal
of
distress
from
afar
the
oak
tree
beside
the
house
whose
roots
coiled
warmly
under
the
and
whose
boughs
were
outstretched
across
the
roof
seemed
to
writhe
and
rock
in
its
winter
sleep
with
murmurings
and
tossings
like
a
human
dreamer
trying
to
get
rid
of
an
unhappy
dream
imagination
might
have
said
that
some
darkest
tragedy
of
forests
long
since
gone
still
lived
in
this
lone
survivor
that
it
struggled
to
give
up
the
grief
and
guilt
of
an
ancient
forest
shame
the
weather
moderated
in
the
afternoon
a
warm
current
swept
across
the
upper
atmosphere
developing
everywhere
behind
it
a
cloud
and
toward
sundown
out
of
this
cloud
down
upon
the
shield
snow
began
to
fall
not
the
large
wet
flakes
which
sometimes
descend
too
late
in
spring
upon
the
buds
of
apple
orchards
nor
those
mournfuller
ones
which
drop
too
soon
on
dim
wild
violets
in
november
woods
but
winter
snow
stern
sculptor
of
arctic
solitudes
it
was
christmas
eve
it
was
snowing
all
over
the
shield
softly
the
snow
fell
upon
the
year
s
footprints
and
pathways
of
children
and
upon
schoolhouses
now
closed
and
riotously
deserted
more
softly
upon
too
crowded
asylums
for
them
houses
of
noonday
darkness
where
eyes
eagerly
look
out
at
the
windows
but
do
not
see
houses
of
soundlessness
where
ears
listen
and
do
not
hear
any
noise
houses
of
silence
where
lips
try
to
speak
but
utter
no
word
the
snow
of
christmas
eve
was
falling
softly
on
the
old
whose
eyes
are
always
seeing
vanished
faces
whose
ears
hear
voices
gentler
than
any
the
earth
now
knows
whose
hands
forever
try
to
reach
other
hands
vainly
held
out
to
them
sad
sad
to
those
who
remember
loved
ones
gone
with
their
kindnesses
the
snow
of
christmas
eve
but
sadder
yet
for
those
who
live
on
together
after
kindnesses
have
ceased
or
whose
love
went
like
a
summer
wind
sad
is
christmas
eve
to
them
dark
its
snow
and
blinding
it
was
late
that
night
she
came
into
the
parlor
clasping
the
bowl
of
a
shaded
lamp
the
only
light
in
the
room
her
face
always
calm
in
life
s
wisdom
but
agitated
now
by
the
tide
of
deep
things
coming
swiftly
in
toward
her
rested
upon
the
darkness
she
placed
the
lamp
on
a
table
near
the
door
and
seated
herself
beside
it
but
she
pushed
the
lamp
away
unconsciously
as
though
the
light
of
the
house
were
no
longer
her
light
and
she
sat
in
the
chair
as
though
it
were
no
longer
her
chair
and
she
looked
about
the
room
as
though
it
were
no
longer
hers
nor
the
house
itself
nor
anything
else
that
she
cared
for
most
earlier
in
the
evening
they
had
finished
hanging
the
presents
on
the
tree
but
then
an
interruption
had
followed
the
children
had
broken
profanely
in
upon
them
rending
the
veil
of
the
house
mysteries
and
for
more
than
an
hour
the
night
had
been
given
up
to
them
now
the
children
were
asleep
upstairs
already
dreaming
of
christmas
morn
and
the
rush
for
the
stockings
the
servants
had
finished
their
work
and
were
gone
to
their
quarters
out
in
the
yard
the
doors
of
the
house
were
locked
there
would
be
no
more
intrusion
now
no
possible
interruption
all
the
years
were
to
meet
him
and
her
alone
for
life
is
the
master
dramatist
when
its
hidden
tragedies
are
ready
to
utter
themselves
everything
superfluous
quits
the
stage
it
is
the
essential
two
who
fill
it
and
how
little
the
rest
of
the
world
ever
hears
of
what
takes
place
between
the
two
a
little
while
before
he
had
left
the
room
with
the
when
he
came
back
he
was
to
bring
with
him
the
manuscript
the
silent
snowfall
of
knowledge
which
had
been
deepening
about
him
for
a
year
the
time
had
already
passed
for
him
to
return
but
he
did
not
come
was
there
anything
in
the
forecast
of
the
night
that
made
him
falter
was
he
shrinking
shrink
she
put
away
the
thought
as
a
strange
outbreak
of
injustice
how
still
it
was
outside
the
house
with
the
snow
falling
how
still
within
she
began
to
hear
the
ticking
of
the
tranquil
old
clock
under
the
stairway
out
in
the
hall
always
tranquil
always
tranquil
and
then
she
began
to
listen
to
the
disordered
strokes
of
her
own
heart
that
red
clock
in
the
body
s
tower
whose
beats
are
sent
outward
along
the
streets
and
alleys
of
the
blood
whose
law
it
is
to
be
alternately
wound
too
fast
by
the
fingers
of
joy
too
slow
by
the
fingers
of
sorrow
and
whose
fate
if
it
once
run
down
never
afterwards
either
by
joy
or
sorrow
to
be
made
to
run
again
at
last
she
could
hear
the
distant
door
of
his
study
open
and
close
and
his
steps
advance
along
the
hall
with
what
a
splendid
swing
and
tramp
he
brought
himself
toward
her
with
what
and
virile
strength
in
his
feet
his
steps
entered
and
crossed
his
bedroom
entered
and
crossed
her
bedroom
and
then
he
stood
there
before
her
in
the
parlor
doorway
a
few
yards
off
stopped
and
regarded
her
intently
smiling
in
a
moment
she
realized
what
had
delayed
him
when
he
had
gone
away
with
the
he
had
on
a
suit
in
which
behind
locked
doors
he
had
been
working
all
the
afternoon
at
the
decorations
of
the
tree
now
he
came
back
ceremoniously
dressed
the
rest
of
the
night
was
to
be
in
her
honor
it
had
always
been
so
on
this
anniversary
of
their
bridal
night
they
had
always
dressed
for
it
the
children
now
in
their
graves
had
been
dressed
for
it
the
children
in
bed
upstairs
were
regularly
dressed
for
it
the
house
was
dressed
for
it
the
servants
were
dressed
for
it
the
whole
life
of
that
establishment
had
always
been
made
to
feel
by
honors
and
tendernesses
and
gayeties
that
this
was
the
night
on
which
he
had
married
her
and
brought
her
home
as
her
eyes
swept
over
him
she
noted
quite
as
never
before
how
these
anniversaries
had
not
taken
his
youth
away
but
had
added
youth
to
him
he
had
grown
like
the
evergreen
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
increase
of
trunk
and
limbs
and
with
larger
tides
of
strength
surging
through
him
toward
the
master
sun
there
were
no
ravages
of
married
life
in
him
time
had
merely
made
the
tree
more
of
a
tree
and
made
his
youth
more
youth
she
took
in
momentary
details
of
his
appearance
a
moisture
like
summer
heat
along
the
edge
of
his
yellow
hair
started
by
the
bath
into
which
he
had
plunged
the
freshness
of
the
enormous
hands
holding
the
manuscript
the
muscle
of
the
forearm
bulging
within
the
sleeve
many
a
time
she
had
wondered
how
so
perfect
an
animal
as
he
had
ever
climbed
to
such
an
elevation
of
work
and
then
had
wondered
again
whether
any
but
such
an
animal
ever
in
life
does
so
climb
shouldering
along
with
him
the
poise
and
breadth
of
health
and
causing
the
hot
sun
of
the
valley
to
shine
on
the
mountain
tops
finally
she
looked
to
see
whether
he
thus
dressed
in
her
honor
thus
but
the
larger
youth
after
all
their
years
together
would
return
her
greeting
with
a
light
in
his
eyes
that
had
always
made
them
so
beautiful
to
her
a
light
burning
as
at
a
portal
opening
inward
for
her
only
his
eyes
rested
on
his
manuscript
he
brought
it
wrapped
and
tied
in
the
true
holiday
spirit
sprigs
of
cedar
and
holly
caught
in
the
ribands
and
he
now
lifted
and
held
it
out
to
her
as
a
jeweller
might
elevate
a
casket
of
gems
then
he
stepped
forward
and
put
it
on
the
table
at
her
elbow
for
you
he
said
reverently
stepping
back
there
had
been
years
when
returning
from
a
tramp
across
the
country
he
would
bring
her
perhaps
nothing
but
a
marvellous
thistle
or
a
brilliant
autumn
leaf
for
her
throat
for
you
he
would
say
and
then
before
he
could
give
it
to
her
he
would
throw
it
away
and
take
her
in
his
arms
afterwards
she
would
pick
up
the
trifle
and
treasure
it
for
you
he
now
said
offering
her
the
treasure
of
his
year
s
toil
and
stepping
back
so
the
weight
of
the
gift
fell
on
her
heart
like
a
stone
she
did
not
look
at
it
or
touch
it
but
glanced
up
at
him
he
raised
his
finger
signalling
for
silence
and
going
to
the
chimney
corner
brought
back
a
long
taper
and
held
it
over
the
lamp
until
it
ignited
then
with
a
look
which
invited
her
to
follow
he
walked
to
the
tree
and
began
to
light
the
candles
he
began
at
the
lowest
boughs
and
passing
around
touched
them
one
by
one
around
and
around
he
went
and
higher
and
higher
twinkled
the
lights
as
they
mounted
the
tapering
sides
of
the
fir
at
the
top
he
kindled
one
highest
red
star
shining
down
on
everything
below
then
he
blew
out
the
taper
turned
out
the
lamp
and
returning
to
the
tree
set
the
heavy
end
of
the
taper
on
the
floor
and
grasped
it
midway
as
one
might
lightly
hold
a
stout
staff
the
room
lighted
now
by
the
common
glow
of
the
candles
revealed
itself
to
be
the
parlor
of
the
house
elaborately
decorated
for
the
winter
festival
holly
wreaths
hung
in
the
windows
the
walls
were
garlanded
evergreen
boughs
were
massed
above
the
window
cornices
on
the
white
lace
of
window
curtains
autumn
leaves
pressed
and
kept
for
this
night
looked
as
though
they
had
been
blown
there
scatteringly
by
october
winds
the
air
of
the
room
was
heavy
with
odors
there
was
summer
warmth
in
it
in
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
the
fir
tree
itself
with
its
top
close
to
the
ceiling
and
its
boughs
stretched
toward
the
four
walls
of
the
room
impartially
as
symbolically
to
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
it
would
be
the
only
witness
of
all
that
was
to
take
place
between
them
what
better
could
there
be
than
this
messenger
of
silence
and
wild
secrecy
from
the
mountains
and
valleys
of
the
planet
its
race
had
looked
out
upon
a
million
generations
of
men
and
women
and
the
calmness
of
its
lot
stretched
across
the
turbulence
of
human
passion
as
an
ancient
bridge
spans
a
modern
river
at
the
apex
of
the
tree
a
star
shone
just
beneath
at
the
first
forking
of
the
boughs
a
candle
burned
a
little
lower
down
a
cross
gleamed
under
the
cross
a
white
dove
hung
poised
its
pinions
outstretched
as
though
descending
out
of
the
infinite
upon
some
earthly
object
below
from
many
of
the
branches
tiny
bells
swung
there
were
little
horns
and
little
trumpets
other
boughs
sagged
under
the
weight
of
silvery
cornucopias
native
and
tropical
fruits
were
tied
on
here
and
there
and
dolls
were
tied
on
also
with
cords
around
their
necks
their
feet
dangling
there
were
smiling
masks
like
men
beheaded
and
smiling
in
their
death
near
the
base
of
the
tree
there
was
a
drum
and
all
over
the
tree
from
pinnacle
to
base
glittered
a
tinsel
like
golden
fleece
looking
as
the
moss
of
old
southern
trees
seen
at
yellow
sunset
he
stood
for
a
while
absorbed
in
contemplation
of
it
this
year
at
his
own
request
the
decorations
had
been
left
wholly
to
him
now
he
seemed
satisfied
he
turned
to
her
eagerly
do
you
remember
what
took
place
on
christmas
eve
last
year
he
asked
with
a
reminiscent
smile
you
sat
where
you
are
sitting
and
i
stood
where
i
am
standing
after
i
had
finished
lighting
the
tree
do
you
remember
what
you
said
after
a
moment
she
stirred
and
passed
her
fingers
across
her
brows
recall
it
to
me
she
answered
i
must
have
said
many
things
i
did
not
know
that
i
had
said
anything
that
would
be
remembered
a
year
recall
it
to
you
looked
at
the
tree
and
said
what
a
mystery
it
is
when
and
where
did
it
begin
how
and
why
this
tree
that
is
now
nourished
in
the
affections
of
the
human
family
round
the
yes
i
remember
i
resolved
to
find
out
for
you
i
determined
to
prepare
during
what
hours
i
could
spare
from
my
regular
college
work
the
gratification
of
your
wish
for
you
as
a
gift
from
me
if
i
could
myself
find
the
way
back
through
the
labyrinth
of
ages
then
i
would
return
for
you
and
lead
you
back
through
the
story
of
the
christmas
tree
as
that
story
has
never
been
seen
by
any
one
else
all
this
year
s
work
then
has
been
the
threading
of
the
labyrinth
now
christmas
eve
has
come
again
my
work
is
finished
my
gift
to
you
is
he
made
this
announcement
and
stopped
leaving
it
to
clear
the
air
of
mystery
the
mystery
of
the
secret
work
then
he
resumed
have
you
then
been
the
incident
in
this
toil
as
yesterday
you
intimated
that
you
were
do
you
now
see
that
you
have
been
the
whole
reason
of
it
you
were
excluded
from
any
share
in
the
work
only
because
you
could
not
help
to
prepare
your
own
gift
that
is
all
what
has
looked
like
a
secret
in
this
house
has
been
no
secret
you
are
blinded
and
bewildered
no
longer
the
hour
has
come
when
holly
and
cedar
can
speak
for
sunlight
broke
out
all
over
his
face
she
made
no
reply
but
said
within
herself
ah
no
that
is
not
the
trouble
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
trouble
the
secret
of
the
house
is
not
a
misunderstanding
it
is
life
it
is
not
the
doing
of
a
year
it
is
the
undoing
of
the
years
it
is
not
a
gift
to
enrich
me
with
new
happiness
it
is
a
lesson
that
leaves
me
he
went
on
without
pausing
it
is
already
late
the
children
interrupted
us
and
took
up
part
of
your
evening
but
it
is
not
too
late
for
me
to
present
to
you
some
little
part
of
your
gift
i
am
going
to
arrange
for
you
a
short
story
out
of
the
long
one
the
whole
long
story
is
there
he
added
directing
his
eyes
toward
the
manuscript
at
her
elbow
and
his
voice
showed
how
he
felt
a
scholar
s
pride
in
it
from
you
it
can
pass
out
to
the
world
that
celebrates
christmas
and
that
often
perhaps
asks
the
same
question
what
is
the
history
of
the
christmas
tree
but
now
my
story
for
you
wait
a
moment
she
said
rising
she
left
the
package
where
it
was
and
with
feet
that
trembled
against
the
soft
carpet
crossed
the
room
and
seated
herself
at
one
end
of
a
deep
sofa
gathering
her
dignity
about
her
she
took
there
the
posture
of
a
listener
listening
at
her
ease
the
sofa
was
of
richly
carved
mahogany
each
end
curved
into
a
scroll
like
a
landward
wave
of
the
sea
one
of
her
arms
rested
on
one
of
the
scrolls
her
elbow
reaching
beyond
touched
a
small
table
on
which
stood
a
vase
of
white
frosted
glass
over
the
rim
of
it
profuse
crimson
carnations
hung
their
heads
they
were
one
of
her
favorite
winter
flowers
and
he
had
had
these
sent
out
to
her
this
afternoon
from
a
hothouse
of
the
distant
town
by
a
messenger
near
her
head
curtains
of
crimson
brocade
swept
down
the
wall
to
the
floor
from
the
window
cornices
at
her
back
were
cushions
of
crimson
silk
at
the
other
end
of
the
sofa
her
piano
stood
and
on
it
lay
the
music
she
played
of
evenings
to
him
or
played
with
thoughts
of
him
when
she
was
alone
and
other
music
also
which
she
many
a
time
read
as
beethoven
s
great
nine
now
along
this
wall
of
the
parlor
from
window
curtain
to
window
curtain
there
stretched
a
festoon
of
evergreens
and
ribands
put
there
by
the
children
for
their
party
and
into
this
festoon
they
had
fastened
bunches
of
mistletoe
plucked
from
the
walnut
tree
felled
the
day
before
they
knowing
nothing
happy
children
there
she
reclined
the
lower
outlines
of
her
figure
were
lost
in
a
rich
blackness
over
which
points
of
jet
flashed
like
swarms
of
silvery
fireflies
in
some
too
warm
a
night
of
the
warm
south
the
blackness
of
her
hair
and
the
blackness
of
her
brows
contrasted
with
the
whiteness
of
her
bare
arms
and
shoulders
and
faultless
neck
and
faultless
throat
bared
also
not
far
away
was
hid
the
warm
thigh
curved
like
venus
s
of
old
out
of
the
sea
s
inaccessible
purity
about
her
wrists
garlands
of
old
family
corals
were
clasped
the
ocean
s
roses
and
on
her
breast
between
the
night
of
her
gown
and
the
dawn
of
the
flesh
coral
buds
flowered
in
beauty
that
could
never
be
opened
never
be
rifled
when
she
had
crossed
the
room
to
the
sofa
two
aged
setters
with
gentle
eyes
and
gentle
ears
and
gentle
breeding
had
followed
her
and
lain
down
at
her
feet
and
one
with
a
thrust
of
his
nose
pushed
her
skirts
back
from
the
toe
of
her
slipper
and
rested
his
chin
on
it
i
will
listen
she
said
shrinking
as
yet
from
other
speech
i
wish
simply
to
listen
there
will
be
time
enough
afterwards
for
what
i
have
to
then
i
shall
go
straight
through
he
replied
one
minute
now
while
i
put
together
the
story
for
you
it
is
hard
to
make
a
good
short
story
out
of
so
vast
a
during
these
moments
of
waiting
she
saw
a
new
picture
of
him
under
stress
of
suffering
and
excitement
discoveries
denied
to
calmer
hours
often
arrive
it
is
as
though
consciousness
receives
a
shock
that
causes
it
to
yawn
and
open
its
abysses
at
the
bottom
we
see
new
things
sometimes
creating
new
happiness
sometimes
old
happiness
is
taken
away
as
he
stood
there
the
man
beside
the
tree
into
the
picture
entered
three
other
men
looking
down
upon
him
from
their
portraits
on
the
walls
one
portrait
represented
the
first
man
of
his
family
to
scale
the
mountains
of
the
shield
where
its
eastern
rim
is
turned
away
from
the
reddening
daybreak
thence
he
had
forced
his
way
to
its
central
portions
where
the
skin
of
ever
living
verdure
is
drawn
over
the
rocks
backwoodsman
borderer
great
forest
chief
hewing
and
fighting
a
path
toward
the
sunset
for
women
and
children
with
his
passion
for
the
wilderness
its
game
enemies
campfire
and
cabin
freedom
this
ancestor
had
a
lonely
stern
gaunt
face
no
modern
expression
in
it
whatsoever
the
timeless
face
of
the
woods
near
his
portrait
hung
that
of
a
second
representative
of
the
family
this
man
had
looked
out
upon
his
vast
parklike
estates
hi
the
central
counties
and
wherever
his
power
had
reached
he
had
used
it
on
a
great
scale
for
the
destruction
of
his
forests
working
to
bring
in
the
period
on
the
shield
when
the
hand
of
a
man
began
to
grasp
the
plough
instead
of
the
rifle
when
the
stallion
had
replaced
the
stag
and
bellowing
cattle
wound
fatly
down
into
the
pastures
of
the
bison
this
man
had
the
face
of
his
caste
the
countenance
of
the
southern
feudal
lord
not
the
american
face
but
the
southern
face
of
a
definite
era
less
than
national
less
than
modern
a
face
not
looking
far
in
any
direction
but
at
things
close
around
from
a
third
portrait
the
latest
ancestor
looked
down
he
with
his
contemporaries
had
finished
the
thinning
of
the
central
forest
of
the
shield
leaving
the
land
as
it
is
a
rolling
prairie
with
remnants
of
woodland
like
that
crowning
the
hilltop
near
this
house
this
immediate
forefather
bore
the
countenance
that
began
to
develop
in
the
northerner
and
in
the
southerner
after
the
civil
war
not
the
northern
look
nor
the
southern
look
but
the
american
look
a
new
thing
in
the
american
face
indefinable
but
unmistakable
these
three
men
now
focussed
their
attention
upon
him
the
fourth
of
the
line
standing
beside
the
tree
brought
into
the
house
each
of
them
in
his
own
way
had
wrought
out
a
work
for
civilization
using
the
woods
as
an
implement
in
his
own
case
the
woods
around
him
having
disappeared
the
ancestral
passion
had
made
him
a
student
of
forestry
the
thesis
upon
which
he
took
his
degree
was
the
relation
of
modern
forestry
to
modern
life
a
few
years
later
in
an
adjunct
professorship
his
original
researches
in
this
field
began
to
attract
attention
these
had
to
do
with
the
south
appalachian
forest
in
its
relation
to
south
appalachian
civilization
and
thus
to
that
of
the
continent
this
work
had
brought
its
reward
he
was
now
to
be
drawn
away
from
his
own
college
and
country
to
a
northern
university
curiously
in
him
there
had
gone
on
a
corresponding
development
of
an
ancestral
face
as
the
look
of
the
wilderness
hunter
had
changed
into
that
of
the
southern
baron
as
this
had
changed
into
the
modern
american
face
unlike
any
other
now
finally
in
him
the
national
american
look
had
broadened
into
something
more
modern
still
the
look
of
mere
humanity
he
did
not
look
like
an
american
he
looked
like
a
man
in
the
service
of
mankind
this
which
it
takes
thus
long
to
recapitulate
presented
itself
to
her
as
one
wide
vision
of
the
truth
it
left
a
realization
of
how
the
past
had
swept
him
along
with
its
current
and
of
how
the
future
now
caught
him
up
and
bore
him
on
part
in
its
problems
the
old
passion
living
on
in
him
forest
life
a
new
passion
born
in
him
human
life
and
by
inexorable
logic
these
two
now
blending
themselves
in
a
story
of
the
christmas
tree
but
womanlike
she
sought
to
pluck
out
of
these
forces
something
intensely
personal
to
which
she
could
cling
and
she
did
it
in
this
wise
in
the
spring
following
their
marriage
often
after
supper
they
would
go
out
on
the
lawn
in
the
twilight
strolling
among
her
flowers
she
leading
him
this
way
and
that
way
and
laying
upon
him
beautiful
exactions
and
tyrannies
how
he
must
do
this
and
do
that
and
not
do
this
and
not
do
that
he
receiving
his
orders
like
a
grateful
slave
then
sometimes
he
would
silently
imprison
her
hand
and
lead
her
down
the
lawn
and
up
the
opposite
hill
to
the
edge
of
the
early
summer
evening
woods
and
there
on
the
roots
of
some
old
tree
the
shadows
of
the
forest
behind
them
and
the
light
of
the
western
sky
in
their
faces
they
would
stay
until
darkness
fell
hiding
their
eyes
from
each
other
the
burning
horizon
became
a
cathedral
interior
the
meeting
of
love
s
holiness
and
the
most
high
the
crescent
dropped
a
silver
veil
upon
the
low
green
hills
wild
violets
were
at
their
feet
the
mosses
and
turf
of
the
shield
under
them
the
warmth
of
his
body
was
as
the
day
s
sunlight
stored
in
the
trunk
of
the
tree
his
hair
was
to
her
like
its
tawny
bloom
native
to
the
sun
life
with
him
was
enchanted
madness
he
had
begun
he
stretched
out
his
arm
and
slowly
began
to
write
on
the
air
of
the
room
sometimes
in
earlier
years
she
had
sat
in
his
classroom
when
he
was
beginning
a
lecture
and
it
was
thus
standing
at
the
blackboard
that
he
sometimes
put
down
the
subject
of
his
lecture
for
the
students
slowly
now
he
shaped
each
letter
and
as
he
finished
each
word
he
read
it
aloud
to
her
a
story
of
the
christmas
tree
for
josephine
wife
of
frederick
iv
the
wandering
tale
josephine
he
uttered
her
name
with
beautiful
reverence
letting
the
sound
of
it
float
over
the
christmas
tree
and
die
away
on
the
garlanded
walls
of
the
room
it
was
his
last
tribute
to
her
a
dedication
then
he
began
josephine
sometimes
while
looking
out
of
the
study
window
a
spring
morning
i
have
watched
you
strolling
among
the
flowers
of
the
lawn
i
have
seen
you
linger
near
a
honeysuckle
in
full
bloom
and
question
the
blossoms
in
your
questioning
way
you
who
are
always
wishing
to
probe
the
heart
of
things
to
drain
out
of
them
the
red
drop
of
their
significance
but
querist
of
actuality
those
fragrant
trumpets
could
blow
to
your
ear
no
message
about
their
origin
it
was
where
the
filaments
of
the
roots
drank
deepest
from
the
mould
of
a
dead
past
that
you
would
have
had
to
seek
the
true
mouthpieces
of
their
philosophy
so
the
instincts
which
blossom
out
thickly
over
the
nature
of
modern
man
to
themselves
are
mute
the
flower
exhibits
itself
at
the
tip
of
the
vine
the
instinct
develops
itself
at
the
farthest
outreach
of
life
and
the
point
where
it
clamors
for
satisfaction
is
at
the
greatest
possible
distance
from
its
birthplace
for
all
these
instincts
send
their
roots
down
through
the
mould
of
the
uncivilized
down
through
the
mould
of
the
primitive
down
into
the
mould
of
the
underhuman
that
ancient
playhouse
dedicated
to
low
tragedies
while
this
may
seem
to
you
to
be
going
far
for
a
commencement
of
the
story
it
is
coming
near
to
us
the
kind
of
man
and
woman
we
are
to
ourselves
the
kind
of
husband
and
wife
we
are
to
each
other
the
kind
of
father
and
mother
we
are
to
our
children
the
kind
of
human
beings
we
are
to
our
fellow
beings
the
passions
which
swell
as
with
sap
the
buds
of
those
relations
until
they
burst
into
their
final
shapes
of
conduct
are
fed
from
the
bottom
of
the
world
s
mould
you
and
i
are
building
the
structures
of
our
moral
characters
upon
that
sink
into
fathomless
ooze
all
we
human
beings
dip
our
drinking
cups
into
a
vast
delta
sweeping
majestically
towards
the
sea
and
catch
drops
trickling
from
the
springs
of
creation
it
is
in
a
vast
ancestral
country
a
fatherland
of
old
desire
that
my
story
lies
for
you
and
for
me
drawn
from
the
forest
and
from
human
nature
as
the
two
have
worked
in
the
destiny
of
the
earth
i
have
wrested
it
from
this
tree
come
out
of
the
ancient
woods
into
the
house
on
this
night
of
the
he
made
the
scholar
s
pause
and
resumed
falling
into
the
tone
of
easy
narrative
it
had
already
become
evident
that
this
method
of
telling
the
story
would
be
to
find
what
alpine
flowers
he
could
for
her
amid
alpine
snows
he
told
her
then
that
the
oldest
traceable
influence
in
the
life
of
the
human
race
is
the
sea
it
is
true
that
man
in
some
ancestral
form
was
rocked
in
the
cradle
of
the
deep
he
rose
from
the
waves
as
the
islanded
greeks
said
of
near
venus
traces
of
this
origin
he
still
bears
both
in
his
body
and
his
emotions
and
together
they
make
up
his
first
set
of
memories
sea
memories
he
deliberated
a
moment
and
then
put
the
truth
before
her
in
a
single
picturesque
phrase
man
himself
is
a
closed
living
in
the
chambers
of
which
the
hues
of
the
first
ocean
are
still
fresh
and
its
tempests
still
are
next
he
told
her
how
man
s
last
marine
ancestor
quit
one
day
the
sea
never
again
to
return
to
the
deep
crossed
the
sands
of
the
beach
and
entered
the
forest
and
how
upon
him
this
living
soft
to
impressions
the
spirit
of
the
forest
fell
to
work
beginning
to
shape
it
over
from
sea
uses
to
forest
uses
a
thousand
thousand
ages
the
spirit
of
the
forest
worked
at
the
it
remodelled
the
shell
as
so
much
clay
stood
it
up
and
twisted
and
branched
it
as
young
pliant
oak
hammered
it
as
iron
tempered
it
as
steel
cast
it
as
bronze
chiselled
it
as
marble
painted
it
as
a
cloud
strung
and
tuned
it
as
an
instrument
lit
it
up
as
a
life
tower
the
world
s
one
beacon
steadily
sending
it
onward
through
one
trial
form
after
another
until
at
last
had
been
perfected
for
it
that
angelic
shape
in
which
as
man
it
was
ever
afterwards
to
sob
and
to
smile
and
thus
as
one
day
a
wandering
had
quit
the
sea
and
entered
the
forest
now
on
another
day
of
that
infinite
time
there
reappeared
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
the
creature
it
had
made
on
every
wall
of
its
being
internal
and
external
and
completely
having
nothing
but
forest
knowledge
forest
feeling
forest
dreams
forest
fancies
forest
faith
so
that
in
all
it
could
do
or
know
or
feel
or
dream
or
imagine
or
believe
it
was
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
then
this
creature
uncontrollably
impelled
to
emerge
from
the
waving
green
sea
of
leaves
as
of
old
it
had
been
driven
to
quit
the
rolling
blue
ocean
of
waters
man
at
the
dawn
of
our
history
of
him
and
if
the
first
set
of
race
memories
sea
memories
still
endure
within
him
how
much
more
powerful
are
the
second
set
the
forest
memories
so
powerful
that
since
the
dawn
of
history
millions
have
perished
as
forest
creatures
only
so
powerful
that
there
are
still
remnant
races
on
the
globe
which
have
never
yet
snapped
the
primitive
tether
and
will
become
extinct
as
mere
forest
creatures
to
the
last
so
powerful
that
those
highest
races
which
have
been
longest
out
in
the
open
as
our
own
aryan
race
have
never
ceased
to
be
reached
by
the
influence
of
the
woods
behind
them
by
the
shadows
of
those
tall
morning
trees
falling
across
the
mortal
clearings
toward
the
sunset
these
master
memories
he
said
filtering
through
the
sandlike
generations
of
our
race
survive
as
those
pale
attenuated
affections
which
we
call
in
ourselves
the
love
of
nature
these
affections
are
inherited
new
feelings
for
nature
we
have
none
the
writers
of
our
day
who
speak
of
civilized
man
s
love
of
nature
as
a
developing
sense
err
wholly
they
are
like
explorers
who
should
mistake
a
boundary
for
the
interior
of
a
continent
man
s
knowledge
of
nature
is
modern
but
it
no
more
endows
him
with
new
feeling
than
modern
knowledge
of
anatomy
supplies
him
with
a
new
bone
or
his
latest
knowledge
about
his
blood
furnishes
him
with
an
additional
artery
old
are
our
instincts
and
passions
about
nature
all
are
forest
memories
but
among
the
mass
of
them
there
is
one
he
said
that
contains
the
separate
buried
root
of
the
story
man
s
forest
faith
when
the
spirit
of
the
forest
had
finished
with
the
it
had
planted
in
him
there
to
grow
forever
the
root
of
faith
that
he
was
a
forest
child
his
origin
in
the
sea
he
had
not
yet
discovered
the
science
of
ages
far
distant
in
the
future
was
to
give
him
that
to
himself
he
was
also
he
believed
it
to
be
his
immediate
ancestor
the
creative
father
of
mankind
thus
the
greeks
in
their
oldest
faith
were
tethered
to
the
idea
that
they
were
descended
from
the
plane
tree
in
the
sagas
and
eddas
the
human
race
is
tethered
to
the
among
every
people
of
antiquity
this
forest
faith
sprang
up
and
flourished
every
race
was
tethered
to
some
ancestral
tree
in
the
orient
each
succeeding
buddha
of
indian
mythology
was
tethered
to
a
different
tree
each
god
of
the
later
classical
pantheon
was
similarly
tethered
jupiter
to
the
oak
apollo
to
the
laurel
bacchus
to
the
vine
minerva
to
the
olive
juno
to
the
apple
on
and
on
forest
worship
was
universal
the
most
impressive
and
bewildering
to
modern
science
that
the
human
spirit
has
ever
built
up
at
the
dawn
of
history
began
the
adoration
of
the
trees
then
as
man
the
wanderer
walked
away
from
his
dawn
across
the
ages
toward
the
sunset
bearing
within
him
this
root
of
faith
it
grew
with
his
growth
the
successive
growths
were
cut
down
by
the
successive
scythes
of
time
but
always
new
sprouts
were
put
forth
thus
to
man
during
the
earliest
ages
the
divine
dwelt
as
a
bodily
presence
within
the
forest
but
one
final
day
the
forest
lost
the
immortal
as
its
indwelling
creator
next
the
old
forest
worshipper
peopled
the
trees
with
an
intermediate
race
of
sylvan
deities
less
than
divine
more
than
human
and
long
he
beguiled
himself
with
the
exquisite
reign
and
proximity
of
these
but
the
lesser
could
not
maintain
themselves
in
temples
from
which
the
greater
had
already
been
expelled
and
they
too
passed
out
of
sight
down
the
roadway
of
the
world
still
the
old
forest
faith
would
not
let
the
wanderer
rest
and
during
yet
later
ages
he
sent
into
the
trees
his
own
nature
so
that
the
woods
became
freshly
endeared
to
him
by
many
a
story
of
how
individuals
of
his
own
race
had
succeeded
as
tenants
to
the
erstwhile
habitations
of
the
gods
then
this
last
panorama
of
illusion
faded
also
and
civilized
man
stood
face
to
face
with
the
modern
woods
inhabitated
only
by
its
sap
and
cells
the
trees
had
drawn
their
bark
close
around
them
wearing
an
inviolate
tapestry
across
those
portals
through
which
so
many
a
stranger
to
them
had
passed
in
and
passed
out
and
henceforth
the
dubious
oracle
of
the
forest
its
one
reply
to
all
man
s
questionings
became
the
voice
of
its
own
mystery
after
this
the
forest
worshipper
could
worship
the
woods
no
more
but
we
must
not
forget
that
civilization
as
compared
with
the
duration
of
human
life
on
the
planet
began
but
yesterday
even
our
own
race
dwells
as
it
were
on
the
forest
edge
and
the
forest
still
reaches
out
and
twines
itself
around
our
deepest
spiritual
truths
home
birth
love
prayer
death
it
tries
to
overrun
them
all
to
reclaim
them
thus
when
we
build
our
houses
instinctively
we
attempt
by
some
clump
of
trees
to
hide
them
and
to
shelter
ourselves
once
more
inside
the
forest
in
some
countries
whenever
a
child
is
born
a
tree
is
planted
as
its
guardian
in
nature
in
our
marriage
customs
the
forest
still
riots
as
master
of
ceremonies
with
garlands
and
fruits
our
prayers
strike
against
the
forest
shaped
hi
cathedral
stone
memory
of
the
grove
god
s
first
temple
and
when
we
die
it
is
the
tree
that
is
planted
beside
us
as
the
sentinel
of
our
rest
even
to
this
day
the
sight
of
a
treeless
grave
arouses
some
obscure
instinct
in
us
that
it
is
yes
he
said
whatsoever
modern
temple
man
has
anywhere
reared
for
his
spirit
over
the
walls
of
it
have
been
found
growing
the
same
leaf
and
tendril
he
has
introduced
the
tree
into
the
ritual
of
every
later
and
thus
he
has
introduced
the
evergreen
into
the
ritual
of
christianity
this
then
is
the
meaning
of
the
christmas
tree
and
of
its
presence
at
the
nativity
at
the
dawn
of
history
we
behold
man
worshipping
the
tree
as
the
creator
literally
present
on
the
earth
in
our
time
we
see
him
using
that
tree
in
the
worship
of
the
creative
father
s
son
come
to
earth
in
the
father
s
stead
on
this
evergreen
in
the
room
falls
the
radiance
of
these
brief
tapers
of
the
night
but
on
it
rests
also
the
long
light
of
that
spiritual
dawn
when
man
began
his
adoration
of
the
trees
it
is
the
forest
taking
its
place
once
more
beside
the
here
he
finished
the
first
part
of
his
story
that
he
should
address
her
thus
and
that
she
thus
should
listen
had
in
it
nothing
unusual
for
them
for
years
it
had
been
his
wont
to
traverse
with
her
the
ground
of
his
lectures
and
she
shared
his
thought
before
it
reached
others
it
was
their
high
and
equal
comradeship
wherever
his
mind
could
go
hers
went
a
brilliant
torch
a
warming
sympathy
but
his
words
had
fallen
on
her
as
withered
leaves
on
a
motionless
figure
of
stone
if
he
was
sensible
of
this
change
in
her
he
gave
no
sign
and
after
a
moment
he
passed
to
the
remaining
part
of
the
story
thus
far
i
have
been
speaking
to
you
of
the
bare
tree
in
wild
nature
here
it
is
loaded
with
decorations
and
now
i
want
to
show
you
that
they
too
are
forest
memories
that
since
the
evergreen
moved
over
into
the
service
of
christianity
one
by
one
like
a
flock
of
birds
these
forest
memories
have
followed
it
and
have
alighted
amid
its
branches
everything
here
has
its
story
i
am
going
to
tell
you
in
each
case
what
that
story
is
i
am
going
to
interpret
everything
on
the
christmas
tree
and
the
other
christmas
decorations
in
the
it
was
at
this
point
that
her
keen
attention
became
fixed
on
him
and
never
afterwards
wavered
if
everything
had
its
story
the
mistletoe
would
have
its
he
must
interpret
that
and
thus
he
himself
unexpectedly
had
brought
about
the
situation
she
wished
she
would
meet
him
at
that
symbolic
bough
there
be
rendered
the
judgment
of
the
years
and
now
as
one
sits
down
at
some
point
of
a
road
where
a
traveller
must
arrive
she
waited
for
him
there
he
turned
to
the
tree
and
explained
briefly
that
as
soon
as
the
forest
worshipper
began
the
worship
of
the
tree
he
began
to
bring
to
it
his
offerings
and
to
hang
these
on
the
boughs
for
religion
consists
in
offering
something
to
worship
is
to
give
in
after
ages
when
man
had
learned
to
build
shrines
and
temples
he
still
kept
up
his
primitive
custom
of
bringing
to
the
altar
his
gifts
and
sacrifices
but
during
that
immeasurable
time
before
he
had
learned
to
carve
wood
or
to
set
one
stone
on
another
he
was
bringing
his
offerings
to
the
grove
the
only
cathedral
he
had
and
this
to
him
was
not
decoration
it
was
prayer
so
that
in
our
age
of
the
world
when
we
playfully
decorate
the
christmas
tree
it
is
a
survival
of
grave
rites
in
the
worship
of
primitive
man
and
is
as
ancient
as
forest
worship
itself
and
now
he
began
with
the
pointer
in
his
hand
he
touched
the
star
at
the
apex
of
the
fir
this
he
said
was
commonly
understood
to
represent
the
star
of
bethlehem
which
guided
the
wise
men
of
the
east
to
the
manger
on
the
night
of
the
nativity
the
star
of
the
new
born
but
modern
discoveries
show
that
the
records
of
ancient
chaldea
go
back
four
or
five
thousand
years
before
the
christian
era
and
as
far
back
as
they
have
been
traced
we
find
the
wise
men
of
the
east
worshipping
this
same
star
and
being
guided
by
it
in
their
spiritual
wanderings
as
they
searched
for
the
incarnation
of
the
divine
they
worshipped
it
as
the
star
of
peace
and
goodness
and
purity
many
a
pious
wolfram
in
those
dim
centuries
no
doubt
sang
his
evening
hymn
to
the
same
star
for
love
of
some
chaldean
elizabeth
both
he
and
she
blown
about
the
desert
how
many
centuries
now
as
dust
moreover
on
these
records
the
star
and
the
tree
are
brought
together
as
here
side
by
side
and
the
story
of
the
star
leads
backward
to
one
of
the
first
things
that
man
ever
worshipped
as
he
looked
beyond
the
forest
the
light
of
the
heavens
floating
in
the
depth
of
space
light
that
he
wanted
but
could
not
grasp
he
touched
the
next
object
on
the
tree
the
candle
under
the
star
and
went
on
imagine
he
said
the
forest
worshipper
as
at
the
end
of
ages
having
caught
this
light
having
brought
it
down
in
the
language
of
his
myth
from
heaven
to
earth
that
is
imagine
the
star
in
space
as
having
become
a
star
in
his
hand
the
candle
the
star
worshipper
had
now
become
also
the
fire
worshipper
thus
the
candle
leads
us
back
to
the
fire
worshippers
of
ancient
persia
those
highlands
of
the
spirit
seeking
light
we
think
of
the
christmas
candle
on
the
tree
as
merely
borrowed
from
the
candle
of
the
altar
for
the
purpose
of
illumination
but
the
use
of
it
goes
back
to
a
time
when
the
forest
worshipper
now
also
the
fire
worshipper
hung
his
lights
on
the
trees
having
no
other
altar
far
down
toward
modern
times
the
temples
of
the
old
prussians
for
example
were
oak
groves
and
among
them
a
hierarchy
of
priests
was
ordained
to
keep
the
sacred
fire
perpetually
burning
at
the
root
of
the
sacred
oak
he
touched
the
third
object
on
the
tree
the
cross
under
the
candle
and
went
on
to
the
christian
believer
the
cross
signifies
one
supreme
event
calvary
and
the
tragedy
of
the
crucifixion
it
was
what
the
marys
saw
and
the
apostles
that
morning
in
gethsemane
but
no
one
in
that
age
thought
of
the
cross
as
a
christian
symbol
john
and
peter
and
paul
and
the
rest
went
down
into
their
graves
without
so
regarding
it
the
magdalene
never
clung
to
it
with
arms
nor
poured
out
at
the
foot
of
it
the
benizon
of
her
tears
not
until
the
third
century
after
christ
did
the
bishops
assembled
at
nice
announce
it
a
christian
symbol
but
it
was
a
sacred
emblem
in
the
dateless
antiquity
of
egypt
to
primitive
man
it
stood
for
that
sacred
light
and
fire
of
life
which
was
himself
for
he
himself
is
a
cross
the
first
cross
he
has
ever
known
the
faithful
may
truly
think
of
the
son
of
man
as
crucified
as
the
image
of
humanity
and
thus
ages
before
christ
cross
worship
and
forest
worship
were
brought
together
for
instance
among
the
druids
who
hunted
for
an
oak
two
boughs
of
which
made
with
the
trunk
of
the
tree
the
figure
of
the
cross
and
on
these
three
they
cut
the
names
of
three
of
their
gods
and
this
was
he
moved
the
pointer
down
until
he
touched
the
fourth
object
on
the
tree
the
dove
under
the
cross
and
went
on
in
the
mind
of
the
christian
believer
this
represents
the
white
dove
of
the
new
testament
which
descended
on
the
son
of
man
when
the
heavens
were
opened
so
in
parsifal
the
white
dove
descends
overshadowing
the
grail
but
ages
before
christ
the
prolific
white
dove
of
syria
was
worshipped
throughout
the
orient
as
the
symbol
of
reproductive
nature
and
to
this
day
the
almighty
is
there
believed
to
manifest
himself
under
this
form
in
ancient
mesopotamia
the
divine
mother
of
nature
is
often
represented
with
this
dove
as
having
actually
alighted
on
her
shoulder
or
in
her
open
hand
and
here
again
forest
worship
early
became
associated
with
the
worship
of
the
dove
for
sixteen
hundred
years
before
christ
we
find
the
dove
nurtured
in
the
oak
grove
at
dodona
where
its
presence
was
an
augury
and
its
wings
an
on
he
went
touching
one
thing
after
another
tracing
the
story
of
each
backward
till
it
was
lost
in
antiquity
and
showing
how
each
was
entwined
with
forest
worship
he
touched
the
musical
instruments
the
bell
the
drum
the
bell
he
said
was
used
in
greece
by
the
priests
of
bacchus
in
the
worship
of
the
vine
and
vine
worship
was
forest
worship
moreover
in
the
same
oak
grove
at
dodona
bells
were
tied
to
the
oak
boughs
and
their
tinklings
also
were
sacred
auguries
the
drum
which
the
modern
boy
beats
on
christmas
day
was
beaten
ages
before
christ
in
the
worship
of
confucius
the
story
of
it
dies
away
toward
what
was
man
s
first
written
music
in
forgotten
china
in
the
first
century
of
the
christian
era
on
one
of
the
most
splendid
of
the
old
buddhist
sculptures
boys
are
represented
as
beating
the
drum
in
the
worship
of
the
sacred
tree
once
more
showing
how
music
passed
into
the
service
of
forest
faith
he
touched
the
cornucopia
and
he
traced
its
story
back
to
the
ram
s
horn
the
primitive
cup
of
libation
used
for
a
drinking
cup
and
used
also
to
pour
out
the
last
product
of
the
vine
in
honor
of
the
vine
itself
the
forest
s
first
goblet
he
touched
the
fruits
and
the
flowers
on
the
tree
these
were
oldest
of
all
perhaps
he
said
for
before
the
forest
worshipper
had
learned
to
shape
or
fabricate
any
offerings
of
his
own
skill
he
could
at
least
bring
to
the
divine
tree
and
hang
on
it
the
flower
of
spring
the
wild
fruit
of
autumn
he
kept
on
until
only
three
things
on
the
tree
were
left
uninterpreted
the
tinsel
the
masks
and
the
dolls
he
told
her
that
he
had
left
these
to
the
last
for
a
reason
seemingly
they
were
the
most
trivial
but
really
the
most
grave
for
by
means
of
them
most
clearly
could
be
traced
the
presence
of
great
law
running
through
the
progress
of
humanity
he
drew
her
attention
to
the
tinsel
that
covered
the
tree
draping
it
like
a
yellow
moss
it
was
of
no
value
he
said
but
in
the
course
of
ages
it
had
taken
the
place
of
the
offering
of
actual
gold
in
forest
worship
a
once
universal
custom
of
adorning
the
tree
with
everything
most
precious
to
the
giver
in
token
of
his
sacrifice
and
even
in
jeremiah
is
an
account
of
the
lading
of
the
sacred
tree
with
gold
and
ornaments
herodotus
relates
that
when
xerxes
was
invading
lydia
on
the
march
he
saw
a
divine
tree
and
had
it
honored
with
golden
robes
and
gifts
livy
narrates
that
when
romulus
slew
his
enemy
on
the
site
of
the
eternal
city
he
hung
rich
spoils
on
the
oak
of
the
capitoline
hill
and
this
custom
of
decorating
the
tree
with
actual
gold
goes
back
in
history
until
we
can
meet
it
coming
down
to
us
in
the
story
of
jason
and
the
golden
fleece
and
in
that
of
the
golden
apples
of
the
hesperides
now
the
custom
has
dwindled
to
this
tinsel
flung
over
the
christmas
tree
the
mock
sacrifice
for
the
real
he
touched
the
masks
and
unfolded
the
grim
story
that
lay
behind
their
mockery
it
led
back
to
the
common
custom
in
antiquity
of
sacrificing
prisoners
of
war
or
condemned
criminals
or
innocent
victims
in
forest
worship
and
of
hanging
their
heads
on
the
branches
we
know
this
to
have
been
the
practice
among
gallic
and
teuton
tribes
in
the
course
of
time
when
such
barbarity
could
be
tolerated
no
longer
the
mock
countenance
replaced
the
real
he
touched
the
dolls
and
revealed
their
sad
story
like
the
others
its
long
path
led
to
antiquity
and
to
the
custom
of
sacrificing
children
in
forest
worship
how
common
this
custom
was
the
early
literature
of
the
human
race
too
abundantly
testifies
we
encounter
the
trace
of
it
in
abraham
s
sacrifice
of
isaac
arrested
by
the
command
of
jehovah
but
abraham
would
never
have
thought
of
slaying
his
son
to
propitiate
his
god
had
not
the
custom
been
well
established
in
the
case
of
jephthah
s
daughter
the
sacrifice
was
actually
allowed
we
come
upon
the
same
custom
in
the
fate
of
iphigenia
at
a
critical
turning
point
in
the
world
s
mercy
in
her
stead
the
life
of
a
lesser
animal
as
in
isaac
s
case
was
accepted
when
the
protective
charity
of
mankind
turned
against
the
inhumanity
of
the
old
faiths
then
the
substitution
of
the
mock
for
the
real
sacrifice
became
complete
and
now
on
the
boughs
of
the
christmas
tree
where
richly
we
come
upon
vestiges
of
primitive
rites
only
these
playful
toys
are
left
to
suggest
the
massacre
of
the
innocent
he
had
covered
the
ground
everything
had
yielded
its
story
all
the
little
stories
like
pathways
running
backward
into
the
distance
and
ever
converging
met
somewhere
in
lost
ages
they
met
in
forest
worship
and
they
met
in
some
sacrifice
by
the
human
heart
and
thus
he
drew
his
conclusion
as
the
lesson
of
the
night
thus
josephine
my
story
ends
for
you
and
for
me
the
christmas
tree
is
all
that
is
left
of
a
forest
memory
the
forest
worshipper
could
not
worship
without
giving
because
to
worship
is
to
give
therefore
he
brought
his
gifts
to
the
forest
his
first
altar
these
gifts
remember
were
never
as
with
us
decorations
they
were
his
sacrifices
and
in
all
the
religions
he
has
had
since
the
same
law
lives
in
his
lower
religions
he
has
sacrificed
the
better
to
the
worse
in
the
higher
ones
he
has
sacrificed
the
worst
to
the
best
if
the
race
should
ever
outgrow
all
religion
whatsoever
it
would
still
have
to
worship
what
is
highest
in
human
nature
and
so
worshipping
it
would
still
be
ruled
by
the
ancient
law
of
sacrifice
become
the
law
of
it
would
still
be
necessary
to
offer
up
what
is
low
in
us
to
what
is
higher
only
one
portion
of
mankind
has
ever
believed
in
jerusalem
but
every
religion
has
known
its
own
he
turned
away
from
the
tree
toward
her
and
awaited
her
appreciation
she
had
sat
watching
him
without
a
movement
and
without
a
word
but
when
at
last
she
asked
him
a
question
she
spoke
as
a
listener
who
wakens
from
a
long
revery
have
you
finished
the
story
for
me
she
inquired
i
have
finished
the
story
for
you
he
replied
without
betraying
disappointment
at
her
icy
reception
of
it
keeping
her
posture
she
raised
one
of
her
white
arms
above
her
head
turning
her
face
up
also
until
the
swanlike
curve
of
the
white
throat
showed
and
with
quivering
finger
tips
she
touched
some
sprays
of
mistletoe
pendent
from
the
garland
on
the
wall
you
have
not
interpreted
this
she
said
her
mind
fixed
on
that
sole
omission
i
have
not
explained
that
he
admitted
she
sat
up
and
for
the
first
time
looked
with
intense
interest
toward
the
manuscript
on
the
table
across
the
room
have
you
explained
it
there
i
have
not
explained
it
but
why
she
said
with
disappointment
i
did
not
wish
you
to
read
that
story
but
why
frederick
she
inquired
startled
into
wonderment
he
smiled
if
i
told
you
why
i
might
as
well
tell
you
the
but
why
do
you
not
wish
to
tell
me
the
story
he
answered
with
warning
frankness
if
you
once
saw
it
as
a
picture
the
picture
would
be
coming
back
to
you
at
times
the
rest
of
your
life
she
protested
if
it
is
dark
to
you
why
should
i
not
share
the
darkness
of
it
have
we
not
always
looked
at
life
s
shadows
together
and
thus
seeing
life
have
not
bright
things
been
doubly
bright
to
us
and
dark
things
but
half
as
dark
he
merely
repeated
his
warning
it
is
a
story
of
a
crueler
age
than
ours
it
goes
back
to
the
forest
worship
of
the
she
answered
so
long
as
our
own
age
is
cruel
what
room
is
left
to
take
seriously
the
mere
stories
of
crueler
ones
am
i
to
shrink
from
the
forest
worship
of
the
druids
is
there
any
story
of
theirs
not
printed
in
books
are
not
the
books
in
libraries
are
they
not
put
in
libraries
to
be
read
if
others
read
them
may
not
i
and
since
when
must
i
begin
to
dread
anything
in
books
or
anything
in
life
and
since
when
did
we
begin
to
look
at
life
apart
we
who
have
always
looked
at
it
with
four
eyes
i
have
always
told
you
there
are
things
to
see
with
four
eyes
things
to
see
with
two
and
things
to
see
with
with
sudden
intensity
her
white
arm
went
up
again
and
touched
the
mistletoe
tell
me
the
story
of
this
she
pleaded
as
though
she
demanded
a
right
as
she
spoke
her
thumb
and
forefinger
meeting
on
a
spray
they
closed
and
went
through
it
like
a
pair
of
shears
and
a
bunch
of
the
white
pearls
of
the
forest
dropped
on
the
ridge
of
her
shoulder
and
were
broken
apart
and
rolled
across
her
breast
into
her
lap
he
looked
grave
silence
or
speech
which
were
better
for
her
either
he
now
saw
would
give
her
pain
happily
the
story
is
far
away
from
us
he
said
as
though
he
were
half
inclined
to
grant
her
request
if
it
is
far
away
bring
it
near
bring
it
into
the
room
as
you
brought
the
stories
of
the
star
and
the
candle
and
the
cross
and
the
dove
and
the
others
make
it
live
before
my
eyes
enact
it
before
me
steep
me
in
it
as
you
have
steeped
yourself
he
held
back
a
long
time
you
who
are
so
safe
in
good
why
know
evil
frederick
she
cried
i
shall
have
to
insist
upon
your
telling
me
this
story
and
if
you
should
keep
any
part
of
it
back
i
would
know
then
tell
it
all
if
it
is
dark
let
each
shadow
have
its
shade
give
each
heavy
part
its
heaviness
let
cruelty
be
cruelty
and
truth
be
truth
he
stood
gazing
across
the
centuries
and
when
he
began
there
was
a
change
in
him
something
personal
was
beginning
to
intrude
itself
into
the
narrative
of
the
historian
imagine
the
world
of
our
human
nature
in
the
last
centuries
before
palestine
became
holy
land
athens
stood
with
her
marbles
glistening
by
the
blue
ægean
and
greek
girls
with
fillets
and
sandals
the
living
images
of
those
pale
sculptured
shapes
that
are
the
mournful
eternity
of
art
greek
girls
were
being
chosen
for
the
secret
rites
in
the
temple
at
ephesus
the
sun
of
italy
had
not
yet
browned
the
little
children
who
were
to
become
the
brown
fathers
and
mothers
of
the
brown
soldiers
of
cæsar
s
legions
and
twenty
miles
south
of
rome
in
the
sacred
grove
of
dodona
where
the
motions
of
oak
boughs
were
auguries
and
the
flappings
of
the
wings
of
white
doves
were
divine
messages
and
the
tinkling
of
bells
in
the
foliage
had
divine
meanings
in
this
grove
the
virgins
of
latium
as
the
greek
girls
of
ephesus
were
once
a
year
appointed
to
undergo
similar
rites
to
the
south
pompeii
with
its
night
laughter
and
song
sounding
far
out
toward
the
softly
lapping
mediterranean
and
up
the
slopes
of
its
dread
volcano
drained
its
goblet
and
did
not
care
emptied
it
as
often
as
filled
and
asked
for
nothing
more
a
little
distance
off
herculaneum
with
its
tender
dreams
of
greece
but
with
its
arms
around
the
breathing
image
of
italy
slept
uncovered
beyond
italy
to
the
north
on
the
other
side
of
the
eternal
snowcaps
lay
unknown
gaul
not
yet
dreaming
of
the
cæsar
who
was
to
conquer
it
and
across
the
wild
sea
opposite
gaul
lay
the
wooded
isle
of
britain
all
over
that
island
one
forest
in
that
forest
one
worship
in
that
worship
one
tree
the
oak
of
england
and
on
that
oak
one
bough
the
he
spoke
to
her
awhile
about
the
oak
describing
the
place
it
had
in
the
early
civilizations
of
the
human
race
in
the
old
testament
it
was
the
tree
of
the
hebrew
idols
and
of
jehovah
in
greece
it
was
the
tree
of
zeus
the
most
august
and
the
most
human
of
the
gods
in
italy
it
was
the
tree
of
jove
great
father
of
immortals
and
of
mankind
after
the
gods
passed
it
became
the
tree
of
the
imperial
cæsars
after
the
cæsars
had
passed
it
was
the
oak
that
michael
angelo
in
the
middle
ages
scattered
over
the
ceiling
of
the
sistine
chapel
near
the
creation
of
man
and
his
expulsion
from
paradise
there
as
always
the
chosen
tree
of
human
desire
in
britain
it
was
the
sacred
tree
of
druidism
there
the
arch
druid
and
his
performed
none
of
their
rites
without
using
its
leaves
and
branches
never
anywhere
in
the
world
was
the
oak
worshipped
with
such
ceremonies
and
sacrifices
as
there
imagine
then
a
scene
the
chief
nature
festival
of
that
forest
worship
the
new
year
s
day
of
the
druids
a
vast
concourse
of
people
men
and
women
and
children
are
on
their
way
to
the
forest
they
are
moving
toward
an
oak
tree
that
has
been
found
with
mistletoe
growing
on
it
growing
there
so
seldom
as
the
excited
throng
come
in
sight
of
it
they
hail
it
with
loud
cries
of
reverence
and
delight
under
it
they
gather
there
a
banquet
is
spread
in
the
midst
of
the
assemblage
one
figure
towers
the
arch
druid
every
eye
is
fixed
fearfully
on
him
for
on
whomsoever
his
own
eye
may
fall
with
wrath
he
may
be
doomed
to
become
one
of
the
victims
annually
sacrificed
to
the
oak
a
gold
chain
is
around
his
neck
gold
bands
are
around
his
arms
he
is
clad
in
robes
of
spotless
white
he
ascends
the
tree
to
a
low
bough
and
making
a
hollow
in
the
folds
of
his
robes
he
crops
with
a
golden
pruning
hook
the
mistletoe
and
so
catches
it
as
it
falls
then
it
is
blessed
and
scattered
among
the
throng
and
the
priest
prays
that
each
one
so
receiving
it
may
receive
also
the
divine
favor
and
blessing
of
which
it
is
nature
s
emblem
two
white
bulls
the
horns
of
which
have
never
hitherto
been
touched
are
now
adorned
with
fillets
and
are
slaughtered
in
sacrifice
then
at
last
it
is
over
the
people
are
gone
the
forest
is
left
to
itself
and
the
new
year
s
ceremony
of
cutting
the
mistletoe
from
the
oak
is
at
an
end
here
he
ended
the
story
she
had
sat
leaning
far
forward
her
fingers
interlocked
and
her
brows
knitted
when
he
stopped
she
sat
up
and
studied
him
a
moment
in
bewilderment
but
why
did
you
call
that
a
dark
story
she
asked
where
is
the
cruelty
it
is
beautiful
and
i
shall
never
forget
it
and
it
will
never
throw
a
dark
image
on
my
mind
new
year
s
day
the
winter
woods
the
journeying
throng
the
oak
the
bough
the
banquet
beneath
the
white
bulls
with
fillets
on
their
horns
the
priest
the
golden
sickle
in
his
hand
the
stroke
that
severs
the
mistletoe
the
prayer
that
each
soul
receiving
any
smallest
piece
will
be
blessed
in
life
s
sorrows
if
i
were
a
great
painter
i
should
like
to
paint
that
scene
in
the
centre
should
be
some
young
girl
pressing
to
her
heart
what
she
believed
to
be
heaven
s
covenant
with
her
under
the
guise
of
a
blossom
how
could
you
have
wished
to
withhold
such
a
story
from
me
he
smiled
at
her
a
little
sadly
i
have
not
yet
told
you
all
he
said
but
i
have
told
you
instantly
she
bent
far
over
toward
him
with
intuitive
scrutiny
under
her
breath
one
word
escaped
ah
it
was
the
breath
of
a
discovery
a
discovery
of
something
unknown
to
her
i
am
sparing
you
josephine
she
stretched
each
arm
along
the
back
of
the
sofa
and
pinioned
the
wood
in
her
clutch
are
you
sparing
me
she
asked
in
a
tone
of
torture
or
are
you
sparing
yourself
the
heavy
staff
on
which
he
stood
leaning
dropped
from
his
relaxed
grasp
to
the
floor
he
looked
down
at
it
a
moment
and
then
calmly
picked
it
up
i
am
going
to
tell
you
the
story
he
said
with
a
new
quietness
she
was
aroused
by
some
change
in
him
i
will
not
listen
i
do
not
wish
to
hear
it
you
will
have
to
listen
he
said
it
is
better
for
you
to
know
better
for
any
human
being
to
know
any
truth
than
suffer
the
bane
of
wrong
thinking
when
you
are
free
to
judge
it
will
be
impossible
for
you
to
i
have
not
misjudged
you
i
have
not
judged
you
in
some
way
that
i
do
not
understand
you
are
judging
yourself
he
stepped
back
a
pace
farther
away
from
her
and
he
drew
himself
up
in
the
movement
there
was
instinctive
resentment
and
the
right
not
to
be
pried
into
not
even
by
the
nearest
the
step
which
had
removed
him
farther
from
her
had
brought
him
nearer
to
the
christmas
tree
at
his
back
a
long
bough
being
thus
pressed
against
was
forced
upward
and
reappeared
on
one
of
his
shoulders
the
movement
seemed
human
it
was
like
the
conscious
hand
of
the
tree
the
fir
standing
there
decked
out
in
the
artificial
tawdriness
of
a
race
laid
its
wild
sincere
touch
on
him
as
sincere
as
the
touch
of
dying
human
fingers
and
let
its
passing
youth
flow
into
him
it
attracted
his
attention
and
he
turned
his
head
toward
it
as
with
recognition
other
boughs
near
the
floor
likewise
thrust
themselves
forward
hiding
his
feet
so
that
he
stood
in
forestry
this
reunion
did
not
escape
her
her
overwrought
imagination
made
of
it
a
sinister
omen
the
bough
on
his
shoulder
rested
there
as
the
old
forest
claim
the
boughs
about
his
feet
were
the
ancestral
forest
tether
as
he
had
stepped
backward
from
her
nature
had
asserted
the
earlier
right
to
him
in
strange
sickness
and
desolation
of
heart
she
waited
he
stood
facing
her
but
looking
past
her
at
centuries
long
gone
the
first
sound
of
his
voice
registered
upon
her
ear
some
message
of
doom
listen
josephine
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
i
can
not
i
will
not
you
will
have
to
listen
you
know
that
for
some
years
apart
from
my
other
work
i
have
been
gathering
together
the
woodland
customs
of
our
people
and
trying
to
trace
them
back
to
their
origin
and
first
meaning
in
our
age
of
the
world
we
come
upon
many
playful
forest
survivals
of
what
were
once
grave
things
often
in
our
play
and
pastimes
and
lingering
superstitions
about
the
forest
we
cross
faint
traces
of
what
were
once
vital
realities
among
these
there
has
always
been
one
that
until
recently
i
have
never
understood
among
country
people
oftenest
but
heard
of
everywhere
is
the
saying
that
if
a
girl
is
caught
standing
under
the
mistletoe
she
may
be
kissed
by
the
man
who
thus
finds
her
i
have
always
thought
that
this
ceremony
and
playful
sacrifice
led
back
to
some
ancient
rite
i
could
not
discover
what
now
i
in
a
voice
full
of
a
new
delicacy
and
scarcely
audible
he
told
her
it
is
another
scene
in
the
forest
of
britain
this
time
it
is
not
the
first
day
of
the
year
the
new
year
s
day
of
the
druids
when
they
celebrated
the
national
festival
of
the
oak
but
it
is
early
summer
perhaps
the
middle
of
may
may
in
england
with
the
young
beauty
of
the
woods
it
is
some
hushed
evening
at
twilight
the
new
moon
is
just
silvering
the
tender
leaves
and
creating
a
faint
shadow
under
the
trees
the
hawthorn
is
in
bloom
red
and
white
and
not
far
from
the
spot
hidden
in
some
fragrant
tuft
of
this
a
nightingale
is
singing
singing
singing
lifting
itself
above
the
smaller
growths
stands
the
young
manhood
of
the
woods
a
splendid
oak
past
its
thirtieth
year
representing
its
youth
and
its
prime
conjoined
in
its
trunk
is
the
summer
heat
of
the
sun
around
its
roots
is
velvet
turf
and
there
are
wild
violet
beds
its
huge
arms
are
stretched
toward
the
ground
as
though
reaching
for
some
object
they
would
clasp
and
on
one
of
these
arms
as
its
badge
of
divine
authority
worn
there
as
a
knight
might
wear
the
colors
of
his
sovereign
grows
the
mistletoe
there
he
stands
the
forest
lover
the
woods
wait
the
shadows
deepen
the
hush
is
more
intense
the
moon
s
rays
begin
to
be
golden
the
song
of
the
nightingale
grows
more
passionate
the
beds
of
moss
and
violets
wait
then
the
shrubbery
is
tremblingly
parted
at
some
place
and
upon
the
scene
a
young
girl
enters
her
hair
hanging
down
her
limbs
most
lightly
clad
the
flush
of
red
hawthorn
on
the
white
hawthorn
of
her
skin
in
her
eyes
love
s
great
need
and
mystery
step
by
step
she
comes
forward
her
fingers
trailing
against
whatsoever
budding
wayside
thing
may
stay
her
strength
she
draws
nearer
to
the
oak
searching
amid
its
boughs
for
that
emblem
which
she
so
dreads
to
find
and
yet
more
dreads
not
to
find
the
emblem
of
a
woman
s
fruitfulness
which
the
young
oak
the
forest
lover
reaches
down
toward
her
finding
it
beneath
it
with
one
deep
breath
of
surrender
she
takes
her
place
the
virgin
s
tryst
with
the
tree
there
to
be
tested
such
is
the
command
of
the
arch
druid
it
is
obedience
submission
to
that
test
or
death
for
her
as
a
sacrifice
to
the
oak
which
she
has
rejected
again
the
shrubbery
is
parted
rudely
pushed
aside
and
a
man
enters
a
tried
and
seasoned
man
a
human
oak
counterpart
of
the
forest
lover
to
officiate
at
the
test
he
was
standing
there
in
the
parlor
of
his
house
and
in
the
presence
of
his
wife
but
in
fealty
he
was
gone
he
was
in
the
summer
woods
of
ancestral
wandering
the
fatherland
of
old
desire
was
the
man
treading
down
the
shrubbery
it
was
feet
that
started
toward
the
oak
eye
that
searched
for
the
figure
half
fainting
under
the
bough
for
the
bed
of
moss
and
violets
the
hair
falling
over
the
eyes
the
loosened
girdle
the
breasts
of
hawthorn
white
and
pink
the
listening
song
of
the
nightingale
the
silence
of
the
summer
woods
the
seclusion
the
full
surrender
of
the
two
under
that
bough
of
the
divine
command
to
escape
the
penalty
of
their
own
death
the
blaze
of
uncontrollable
desire
was
all
over
him
the
fire
of
his
own
story
had
treacherously
licked
him
like
a
flame
the
light
that
she
had
not
seen
in
his
eyes
for
so
long
rose
in
them
the
old
unfathomable
infolding
tenderness
a
quiver
ran
around
his
tense
nostrils
and
now
one
little
phrase
which
he
had
uttered
so
sacredly
years
before
and
had
long
since
forgotten
rose
a
second
time
to
his
lips
tossed
there
by
a
second
tide
of
feeling
on
the
silence
of
the
room
fell
his
words
of
the
mistletoe
the
storm
that
had
broken
over
him
died
away
he
shut
his
eyes
on
the
vanishing
scene
he
opened
them
upon
her
he
had
told
her
the
truth
about
the
story
he
may
have
been
aware
or
he
may
not
have
been
aware
that
he
had
revealed
to
her
the
truth
about
himself
this
is
what
i
would
have
kept
from
you
josephine
he
said
quietly
she
was
sitting
there
before
him
the
mother
of
his
children
of
the
sleeping
ones
of
the
buried
ones
the
butterfly
broken
on
the
wheel
of
years
lustreless
and
useless
now
in
its
summer
she
sat
there
with
the
whiteness
of
death
the
room
of
the
silences
the
christmas
candles
looked
at
her
flickeringly
the
little
white
candles
of
purity
the
little
red
candles
of
love
the
holly
in
the
room
concealed
its
bold
gay
berries
behind
its
thorns
and
the
cedar
from
the
faithful
tree
beside
the
house
wall
had
need
now
of
its
bitter
rosary
her
first
act
was
to
pay
what
is
the
first
debt
of
a
fine
spirit
the
debt
of
courtesy
and
gratitude
it
is
a
wonderful
story
frederick
she
said
in
a
manner
which
showed
him
that
she
referred
to
the
beginning
of
his
story
and
not
to
the
end
as
usual
you
have
gone
your
own
way
about
it
opening
your
own
path
into
the
unknown
seeing
what
no
one
else
has
seen
and
bringing
back
what
no
one
else
ever
brought
it
is
a
great
revelation
of
things
that
i
never
dreamed
of
and
could
never
have
imagined
i
appreciate
your
having
done
this
for
me
it
has
taken
time
and
work
but
it
is
too
much
for
me
it
is
too
new
and
too
vast
i
must
hereafter
try
to
understand
it
and
there
will
be
leisure
enough
nor
can
it
lose
by
waiting
but
now
there
is
something
that
can
not
wait
and
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
about
that
frederick
i
am
going
to
ask
you
some
questions
about
the
last
part
of
the
story
i
have
been
wanting
to
ask
you
a
long
time
the
story
gives
me
the
chance
and
the
he
advanced
a
step
toward
her
disengaging
himself
from
the
evergreen
i
will
answer
them
he
said
if
they
can
be
and
thus
she
sat
and
thus
he
stood
as
the
questions
and
answers
passed
to
and
fro
they
were
solemn
questions
and
solemn
replies
drawn
out
of
the
deeps
of
life
and
sinking
back
into
them
frederick
she
said
for
many
years
we
have
been
happy
together
so
happy
every
tragedy
of
nature
has
stood
at
a
distance
from
us
except
the
loss
of
our
children
we
have
lived
on
a
sunny
pinnacle
of
our
years
lifted
above
life
s
storms
but
of
course
i
have
realized
that
sooner
or
later
our
lot
must
become
the
common
one
if
we
did
not
go
down
to
sorrow
sorrow
would
climb
to
us
and
i
knew
that
on
the
heights
it
dwells
best
that
is
why
i
wish
to
say
to
you
what
i
shall
i
think
fate
s
hour
has
struck
for
me
i
am
ready
to
hear
it
its
arrow
has
already
left
the
bow
and
is
on
its
way
i
open
my
heart
to
receive
it
this
is
as
i
have
always
wished
i
have
said
that
if
life
had
any
greatest
tragedy
for
me
i
hoped
it
would
come
when
i
was
happiest
thus
i
should
confront
it
all
i
have
never
drunk
half
of
my
cup
of
happiness
as
you
know
and
let
the
other
half
waste
i
must
go
equally
to
the
depth
of
any
suffering
worse
than
the
suffering
i
think
would
be
the
feeling
that
i
had
shirked
some
of
it
had
stepped
aside
or
shut
my
eyes
or
in
any
manner
shown
myself
a
cowardly
after
a
pause
she
went
over
this
subject
as
though
she
were
not
satisfied
that
she
had
made
it
clear
i
have
always
said
that
the
real
pathos
of
things
is
the
grief
that
comes
to
us
in
life
when
life
is
at
its
best
when
no
one
is
to
blame
when
no
one
has
committed
a
fault
when
suffering
is
meted
out
to
us
as
the
reward
of
our
perfect
obedience
to
the
laws
of
nature
in
earlier
years
when
we
used
to
read
keats
together
who
most
of
all
of
the
world
s
poets
felt
the
things
that
pass
even
then
i
was
wondering
at
the
way
in
which
he
brings
this
out
that
to
understand
sorrow
it
must
be
separated
from
sorrows
they
would
be
like
shadows
darkening
the
bright
disk
of
life
s
clear
tragedy
thus
rendering
it
less
bravely
seen
and
so
he
is
always
telling
us
not
to
summon
sad
pictures
nor
play
with
mournful
emblems
not
to
feign
ourselves
as
standing
on
the
banks
of
lethe
gloomiest
of
rivers
nor
to
gather
wolf
s
bane
and
twist
the
poison
out
of
its
tight
roots
nor
set
before
us
the
cup
of
hemlock
nor
bind
about
our
temples
the
ruby
grape
of
nightshade
nor
count
over
the
berries
of
the
yew
tree
which
guards
sad
places
nor
think
of
the
beetle
ticking
in
the
bed
post
nor
watch
the
wings
of
the
death
moth
nor
listen
to
the
elegy
of
the
owl
the
voice
of
ruins
not
these
they
are
the
emblems
of
our
sorrows
but
the
emblems
of
sorrow
are
beautiful
things
at
their
perfect
moment
a
red
peony
just
opening
a
rainbow
seen
for
an
instant
on
the
white
foam
youth
not
yet
faded
but
already
fading
joy
with
its
finger
on
his
lips
bidding
adieu
and
so
with
all
my
happiness
about
me
i
wish
to
know
life
s
tragedy
and
to
know
it
frederick
not
to
infer
it
want
to
be
if
you
can
be
told
you
shall
be
told
he
said
she
changed
her
position
as
though
seeking
physical
relief
and
composure
then
she
began
years
ago
when
you
were
a
student
in
germany
you
had
a
college
friend
you
went
home
with
him
two
or
three
years
at
christmas
and
celebrated
the
german
christmas
it
was
in
this
way
that
we
came
to
have
the
christmas
tree
in
our
house
through
memory
of
him
and
of
those
years
you
have
often
described
to
me
how
you
and
he
in
summer
went
alpine
climbing
and
far
up
in
some
green
valley
girdled
with
glaciers
lay
of
afternoons
under
some
fir
tree
reading
and
drowsing
in
the
crystalline
air
you
told
me
of
your
nights
of
wandering
down
the
rhine
together
when
the
heart
turns
so
intimately
to
the
heart
beside
it
he
was
german
youth
and
song
and
dream
and
happiness
to
you
tell
me
this
before
you
lost
him
that
last
summer
over
the
crevasse
had
you
begun
to
tire
of
him
was
there
anything
in
you
that
began
to
draw
back
from
anything
in
him
as
you
now
look
back
at
the
friendship
of
your
youth
have
the
years
lessened
your
regret
for
him
he
answered
out
of
the
ideals
of
his
youth
the
longer
i
knew
him
the
more
i
loved
him
i
never
tired
of
being
with
him
nothing
in
me
ever
drew
back
from
anything
in
him
when
he
was
lost
the
whole
world
lost
some
of
its
strength
and
nobility
after
all
the
years
if
he
could
come
back
he
would
find
me
unchanged
that
friend
of
my
youth
with
a
peculiar
change
of
voice
she
asked
next
the
doctor
herbert
and
elsie
s
father
our
nearest
neighbor
your
closest
friend
now
in
middle
life
you
see
a
great
deal
of
the
doctor
he
is
often
here
and
you
and
he
often
sit
up
late
at
night
talking
with
one
another
about
many
things
do
you
ever
tire
of
the
doctor
and
wish
him
away
have
you
any
feeling
toward
him
that
you
try
to
keep
secret
from
me
can
you
be
a
perfectly
frank
man
with
this
friend
of
your
middle
life
the
longer
i
know
him
the
more
i
like
him
honor
him
trust
him
i
never
tire
of
his
companionship
or
his
conversation
i
have
no
disguises
with
him
and
need
the
children
as
the
children
grow
older
do
you
care
less
for
them
do
they
begin
to
wear
on
you
are
they
a
clog
an
interference
have
harold
and
elizabeth
ceased
forming
new
growths
of
affection
in
you
do
you
ever
unconsciously
seek
pretexts
for
avoiding
them
the
older
they
grow
the
more
i
love
them
the
more
they
interest
me
and
tempt
away
from
work
and
duties
i
am
more
drawn
to
be
with
them
and
i
live
more
and
more
in
the
thought
of
what
they
are
your
work
does
your
work
attract
you
less
than
formerly
does
it
develop
in
you
the
purpose
to
be
something
more
or
stifle
in
you
the
regret
to
be
something
less
is
it
a
snare
to
idleness
or
a
goad
to
toil
as
the
mariner
steers
for
the
lighthouse
as
the
hound
runs
down
the
stag
as
the
soldier
wakes
to
the
bugle
as
the
miner
digs
for
fortune
as
the
drunkard
drains
the
cup
as
the
saint
watches
the
cross
i
follow
my
work
i
follow
my
life
life
itself
does
it
increase
in
value
or
lessen
is
the
world
still
morning
to
you
with
your
work
ahead
or
afternoon
when
you
begin
to
tire
and
to
think
of
rest
the
world
to
me
is
as
early
morning
to
a
man
going
forth
to
his
work
where
the
human
race
is
from
and
whither
it
is
hurrying
and
why
it
exists
at
all
why
a
human
being
loves
what
it
loves
and
hates
what
it
hates
why
it
is
faithful
when
it
could
be
unfaithful
and
faithless
when
it
should
be
true
how
civilized
man
can
fight
single
handed
against
the
ages
that
were
his
lower
past
how
he
can
develop
out
of
selfishness
and
his
own
wisdom
out
of
surrounding
folly
all
these
are
questions
that
mean
more
and
more
my
work
is
but
beginning
and
the
world
is
this
house
are
you
tired
of
it
now
that
it
is
older
would
you
rather
move
into
a
new
one
i
love
this
house
more
and
more
no
other
dwelling
could
take
its
place
any
other
could
be
but
a
shelter
this
is
home
and
i
care
more
for
it
now
that
the
signs
of
age
begin
to
settle
on
it
if
it
were
a
ruin
i
should
love
it
best
she
leaned
over
and
looked
down
at
the
two
setters
lying
at
her
feet
do
you
care
less
for
the
dogs
of
the
house
as
they
grow
older
i
think
more
of
them
and
take
better
care
of
them
now
that
their
hunting
days
are
the
friend
of
your
youth
the
friend
of
your
middle
age
the
children
your
profession
the
world
of
human
life
this
house
the
dogs
of
the
house
you
care
more
for
them
all
as
time
passes
i
care
more
for
them
all
as
time
then
there
came
a
great
stillness
in
the
room
the
stillness
of
all
listening
years
am
i
the
only
thing
that
you
care
less
for
as
time
passes
there
was
no
reply
am
i
in
the
way
there
was
no
reply
would
you
like
to
go
over
it
all
again
with
another
there
was
no
reply
she
had
hidden
her
face
in
her
hands
and
pressed
her
head
against
the
end
of
the
sofa
her
whole
figure
shrank
lower
as
though
to
escape
being
touched
by
him
to
escape
the
blow
of
his
words
no
words
came
there
was
no
touch
a
moment
later
she
felt
that
he
must
be
standing
over
her
looking
down
at
her
she
would
respond
to
his
hand
on
the
back
of
her
neck
he
must
be
kneeling
beside
her
his
arms
would
infold
her
then
with
a
kind
of
incredible
terror
she
realized
that
he
was
not
there
at
first
she
could
so
little
believe
it
that
with
her
face
still
buried
in
one
hand
she
searched
the
air
for
him
with
the
other
expecting
to
touch
him
then
she
cried
out
to
him
isn
t
there
anything
you
can
say
to
me
silence
lasted
fred
fred
fred
in
the
stillness
she
began
to
hear
something
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
moving
on
the
carpet
she
sat
up
the
room
was
getting
darker
he
was
putting
out
the
candles
it
was
too
dark
already
to
see
his
face
with
fascination
she
began
to
watch
his
hand
how
steady
it
was
as
it
moved
among
the
boughs
extinguishing
the
lights
out
they
went
one
by
one
and
back
into
their
darkness
returned
the
emblems
of
darker
ages
the
forest
memories
a
solitary
taper
was
left
burning
at
the
pinnacle
of
the
tree
under
the
cross
that
highest
torch
of
love
shining
on
everything
that
had
disappeared
he
quietly
put
it
out
yet
the
light
seemed
not
put
out
but
instantly
to
have
travelled
through
the
open
parlor
door
into
the
adjoining
room
her
bedroom
for
out
of
that
there
now
streamed
a
suffused
red
light
it
came
from
the
lamp
near
the
great
bed
in
the
shadowy
corner
this
lamp
poured
its
light
through
a
lampshade
having
the
semblance
of
a
bursting
crimson
peony
as
some
morning
in
june
the
flower
with
the
weight
of
its
own
splendor
falls
face
downward
on
the
grass
and
in
that
room
this
soft
fell
here
and
there
on
crimson
winter
draperies
he
had
been
living
alone
as
a
bachelor
before
he
married
her
after
they
became
engaged
he
having
watched
for
some
favorite
color
of
hers
had
had
this
room
redecorated
in
that
shade
every
winter
since
she
had
renewed
in
this
way
or
that
way
these
hangings
and
now
the
bridal
draperies
remained
unchanged
after
the
changing
years
he
replaced
the
taper
against
the
wall
and
came
over
and
stood
before
her
holding
out
his
hands
to
help
her
rise
she
arose
without
his
aid
and
passed
around
him
moving
toward
her
bedroom
with
arms
outstretched
guarding
her
but
not
touching
her
he
followed
close
for
she
was
unsteady
she
entered
her
bedroom
and
crossed
to
the
door
of
his
bedroom
she
pushed
this
open
and
keeping
her
face
bent
aside
waited
for
him
to
go
in
he
went
in
and
she
closed
the
door
on
him
and
turned
the
key
then
with
a
low
note
with
which
the
soul
tears
out
of
itself
something
that
has
been
its
life
she
made
a
circlet
of
her
white
arms
against
the
door
and
laid
her
profile
within
this
circlet
and
stood
the
figure
of
memory
thus
sometimes
a
stranger
sees
a
marble
figure
standing
outside
a
tomb
where
some
story
of
love
and
youth
ended
some
stranger
in
a
far
land
walking
some
afternoon
in
those
quieter
grounds
where
all
human
stories
end
an
autumn
bird
in
the
bare
branches
fluting
of
its
mortality
and
his
heart
singing
with
the
bird
of
one
lost
to
him
lost
to
him
in
his
own
country
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
the
silence
was
that
of
a
tomb
she
had
felt
confident
so
far
as
she
had
expected
anything
that
he
would
speak
to
her
through
the
door
try
to
open
it
plead
with
her
to
open
it
nothing
of
the
kind
occurred
why
did
he
not
come
back
what
bolt
could
have
separated
her
from
him
the
silence
began
to
weigh
upon
her
then
in
the
tense
stillness
she
heard
him
moving
quietly
about
getting
ready
for
bed
there
were
the
same
movements
familiar
to
her
for
years
she
would
not
open
the
door
she
could
not
leave
it
she
could
not
stand
no
support
was
near
and
she
sank
to
the
floor
and
sat
there
leaning
her
brow
against
the
lintel
on
the
other
side
the
quiet
preparations
went
on
she
heard
him
take
off
his
coat
and
vest
and
hang
them
on
the
back
of
a
chair
the
buttons
made
a
little
scraping
sound
against
the
wood
then
he
went
to
his
dresser
and
took
off
his
collar
and
tie
and
he
opened
a
drawer
and
laid
out
a
she
heard
the
creaking
of
a
chair
under
him
as
he
threw
one
foot
and
then
the
other
up
across
his
knee
and
took
off
his
shoes
and
socks
then
there
reached
her
the
soft
movements
of
his
bare
feet
on
the
carpet
despite
her
agony
the
old
impulse
started
in
her
to
caution
him
about
his
slippers
then
followed
the
brushing
of
his
teeth
and
the
deliberate
bathing
of
his
hands
then
was
audible
the
puff
of
breath
with
which
he
blew
out
his
lamp
after
he
had
turned
it
low
and
then
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
just
above
her
ear
his
knock
sounded
the
same
knock
waited
for
and
responded
to
throughout
the
years
so
often
with
his
little
variations
of
playfulness
many
a
time
in
early
summer
when
she
would
be
reminded
of
it
by
hearing
some
bird
sounding
its
love
signal
on
a
piece
of
dry
wood
that
tap
of
now
it
crashed
close
to
her
ear
such
strength
came
back
to
her
that
she
rose
as
lightly
as
though
her
flesh
were
but
will
and
spirit
when
he
knocked
again
she
was
across
the
room
sitting
on
the
edge
of
her
bed
with
her
palms
pressed
together
and
thrust
between
her
knees
the
instinctive
act
of
a
human
animal
suddenly
chilled
to
the
bone
the
knocking
sounded
again
was
there
anything
you
needed
she
asked
fearfully
there
was
no
response
but
another
knock
she
hurriedly
raised
her
voice
to
make
sure
that
it
would
reach
him
was
there
anything
you
wanted
as
no
response
came
the
protective
maternal
instinct
took
greater
alarm
and
she
crossed
to
the
door
of
his
room
and
she
repeated
her
one
question
did
you
forget
anything
her
mind
refused
to
release
itself
from
the
iteration
of
that
idea
it
was
some
not
herself
that
he
wanted
he
knocked
her
imagination
long
oppressed
by
his
silence
now
made
of
his
knock
some
signal
of
distress
it
took
on
the
authority
of
an
appeal
not
to
be
denied
she
unlocked
the
door
and
opened
it
a
little
way
and
once
more
she
asked
her
one
poor
question
his
answer
to
it
came
in
the
form
of
a
gentle
pressure
against
the
door
breaking
down
her
resistance
as
she
applied
more
strength
this
was
as
gently
overcome
and
when
the
opening
was
sufficient
he
walked
past
her
into
the
room
how
hushed
the
house
how
still
the
world
outside
as
the
cloud
wove
in
darkness
its
mantle
of
light
vi
the
white
dawn
day
was
breaking
the
crimson
curtains
of
the
bedroom
were
drawn
close
but
from
behind
their
outer
edges
faint
flanges
of
light
began
to
advance
along
the
wall
it
was
a
clear
light
reflected
from
snow
which
had
sifted
in
against
the
was
banked
on
the
sills
outside
ridged
the
yard
fence
peaked
the
little
and
buried
the
shrubbery
there
was
no
need
to
look
out
in
order
to
know
that
it
had
stopped
snowing
that
the
air
was
windless
and
that
the
stars
were
flashing
except
one
great
shepherd
of
the
thick
moving
host
it
was
christmas
morning
on
the
effulgent
shield
already
there
was
sufficient
light
in
the
room
to
reveal
less
as
actual
things
than
as
brown
shadows
of
the
memory
a
gay
company
of
socks
and
stockings
hanging
from
the
mantelpiece
sufficient
to
give
outline
to
the
bulk
of
a
man
asleep
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
it
exposed
to
view
in
a
corner
of
the
room
farthest
from
the
rays
a
woman
sitting
in
a
chair
a
shawl
thrown
about
her
shoulders
over
her
he
always
slept
till
he
was
awakened
the
children
having
stayed
up
past
their
usual
bedtime
would
sleep
late
also
she
had
the
white
dawn
to
herself
in
quietness
she
needed
it
sleep
could
not
have
come
to
her
had
she
wished
she
had
not
slept
and
she
had
not
lain
down
and
the
sole
endeavor
during
those
shattered
hours
had
been
to
prepare
herself
for
his
awakening
she
was
not
yet
ready
she
felt
that
during
the
rest
of
her
life
she
should
never
be
quite
ready
to
meet
him
again
scant
time
remained
now
soon
all
over
the
shield
indoor
merriment
and
outdoor
noises
would
begin
wherever
in
the
lowlands
any
city
proud
of
its
size
rose
by
the
sweep
of
watercourses
or
any
little
inland
town
was
proud
of
its
smallness
and
of
streets
that
terminated
in
the
fields
whereever
any
hamlet
marked
the
point
at
which
two
country
roads
this
morning
made
the
sign
of
the
white
cross
or
homesteads
stood
proudly
castled
on
woody
hilltops
or
warmed
the
heart
of
the
beholder
from
amid
their
winter
pastures
or
far
away
on
the
shaggy
uplift
of
the
shield
wherever
any
cabin
clung
like
a
swallow
s
nest
against
the
gray
appalachian
wall
everywhere
soon
would
begin
the
healthy
outbreak
of
joy
among
men
and
women
and
children
glad
about
themselves
glad
in
one
another
glad
of
human
life
in
a
happy
world
the
roar
and
din
of
this
warm
carnival
lay
not
far
away
from
her
across
the
cold
bar
of
silence
soon
within
the
house
likewise
the
rush
of
the
children
s
feet
would
startle
her
ear
they
would
be
tugging
at
the
door
tugging
at
her
heart
and
as
she
thought
of
this
the
recollection
of
old
simple
things
came
pealing
back
to
her
from
behind
life
s
hills
the
years
parted
like
naked
frozen
reeds
and
she
sorely
stricken
in
her
womanhood
fled
backward
till
she
herself
was
a
child
again
safe
in
her
father
s
and
mother
s
protection
it
was
christmas
morning
and
she
in
bare
feet
was
tipping
over
the
cold
floors
toward
their
bedroom
toward
her
stockings
her
father
and
mother
how
she
needed
them
at
this
moment
they
had
been
sweethearts
all
their
lives
one
picture
of
them
rose
with
distinctness
before
her
for
the
wounding
picture
always
comes
to
the
wounded
moment
she
saw
them
sitting
in
their
pew
far
down
toward
the
chancel
through
a
stained
glass
window
where
there
was
a
ladder
of
angels
the
light
fell
softly
on
them
both
and
as
with
the
voices
of
children
they
were
singing
out
of
one
book
she
remembered
how
as
she
sat
between
them
she
had
observed
her
father
slip
his
hand
into
her
mother
s
lap
and
clasp
hers
with
a
steadfastness
that
wedded
her
for
eternity
and
thus
over
their
linked
hands
with
the
love
of
their
youth
within
them
and
the
snows
of
the
years
upon
them
they
sang
together
gently
lord
o
gently
lead
us
through
the
changes
thou
st
decreed
her
father
and
mother
had
not
been
led
gently
they
had
known
more
than
common
share
of
life
s
shocks
and
violence
its
wrongs
and
meannesses
and
ills
and
griefs
but
their
faith
had
never
wavered
that
they
were
being
led
gently
so
long
as
they
were
led
together
to
them
it
was
gentle
leading
the
richer
each
in
each
for
aught
whereby
nature
or
man
could
leave
them
poorer
the
calmer
for
the
shocks
the
sweeter
for
the
sour
the
finer
with
one
another
because
of
life
s
rudenesses
in
after
years
she
often
thought
of
them
as
faithful
in
their
dust
and
the
flowers
she
planted
over
them
and
watered
many
a
bright
day
with
happy
tears
brought
up
to
her
in
another
form
the
freshness
of
their
unwearied
union
that
was
what
she
had
not
doubted
her
own
life
would
be
with
him
when
she
had
married
him
from
the
moment
of
the
night
before
when
he
had
forced
the
door
open
and
entered
her
room
they
had
not
exchanged
any
words
nor
a
glance
he
had
lain
down
and
soon
fallen
asleep
apparently
he
had
offered
that
to
her
as
for
the
moment
at
least
his
solution
of
the
matter
that
he
should
leave
her
to
herself
and
absent
himself
in
slumber
the
instant
she
knew
him
to
be
asleep
she
set
about
her
preparations
before
he
awoke
she
must
be
gone
out
of
the
house
anywhere
to
save
herself
from
living
any
longer
with
him
his
indifference
in
the
presence
of
her
suffering
his
pitiless
withdrawal
from
her
of
touch
and
glance
and
speech
as
she
had
gone
down
into
that
darkest
of
life
s
valleys
his
will
of
iron
that
since
she
had
insisted
upon
knowing
the
whole
truth
know
it
she
should
all
this
left
her
wounded
and
stunned
as
by
an
incredible
blow
and
she
was
acting
first
from
the
instinct
of
removing
herself
beyond
the
reach
of
further
humiliation
and
brutality
instinctively
she
took
off
her
wedding
ring
and
laid
it
on
his
dresser
beside
his
watch
he
would
find
it
there
in
the
morning
and
he
could
dispose
of
it
then
she
changed
her
dress
for
the
plainest
heavy
one
and
put
on
heavy
walking
shoes
she
packed
into
a
handbag
a
few
necessary
things
with
some
heirlooms
of
her
own
among
the
latter
was
a
case
of
family
jewels
and
as
she
opened
it
her
eyes
fell
upon
her
mother
s
thin
wedding
ring
and
with
quick
reverence
she
slipped
that
on
and
kissed
it
bitterly
she
lifted
out
also
her
mother
s
locket
containing
a
miniature
daguerreotype
of
her
father
and
dutifully
fed
her
eyes
on
that
her
father
was
not
then
but
with
eyes
that
men
feared
at
times
but
no
woman
ever
his
eyes
were
on
her
now
as
so
often
in
girlhood
when
he
had
curbed
her
exuberance
and
guided
her
waywardness
he
was
watching
as
she
coarsely
wrapped
and
carrying
some
bundle
of
things
of
her
own
opened
her
front
door
left
her
footprints
in
the
snow
on
the
porch
and
passed
out
wading
away
those
eyes
of
his
saw
what
took
place
the
next
day
the
happiness
of
christmas
morning
turned
into
horror
the
children
wild
with
distress
and
crying
the
servants
dumb
the
inquiry
at
neighbors
houses
the
news
spreading
to
the
town
the
papers
the
black
ruin
and
from
him
two
restraining
words
issued
for
her
ear
my
daughter
passionately
she
bore
the
picture
to
her
lips
and
her
pride
answered
him
and
so
answering
it
applied
a
torch
to
her
blood
and
her
blood
took
fire
and
a
flame
of
rage
spread
through
and
swept
her
she
stopped
her
preparations
she
had
begun
to
think
as
well
as
to
feel
she
unpacked
her
travelling
bag
putting
each
article
back
into
its
place
with
exaggerated
pains
having
done
this
she
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
looking
about
her
irresolute
then
responding
to
that
power
of
low
suggestion
which
is
one
of
anger
s
weapons
she
began
to
devise
malice
she
went
to
a
wardrobe
and
stooping
down
took
from
a
bottom
drawer
where
long
ago
it
had
been
stored
away
under
everything
else
a
shawl
that
had
been
her
grandmother
s
a
brindled
crewel
shawl
sometimes
worn
by
superannuated
women
of
a
former
generation
a
garment
of
hideousness
once
when
a
little
girl
she
had
loyally
jerked
it
off
her
grandmother
because
it
added
to
her
ugliness
and
decrepitude
she
shook
this
out
with
mocking
eyes
and
threw
it
decoratively
around
her
shoulders
she
strode
to
the
gorgeous
peony
lampshade
and
lifting
it
off
gibbeted
it
and
scattered
the
fragments
on
the
floor
she
turned
the
lamp
up
as
high
as
it
would
safely
burn
so
that
the
huge
lidless
eye
of
it
would
throw
its
full
glare
on
him
and
her
she
drew
a
rocking
chair
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
seating
herself
put
her
forefinger
up
to
each
temple
and
drew
out
from
their
hiding
places
under
the
mass
of
her
black
hair
two
long
gray
locks
and
let
these
hang
down
haglike
across
her
bosom
she
banished
the
carefully
nourished
look
of
youth
from
her
face
dropped
the
will
to
look
young
and
allowed
the
years
to
rush
into
it
into
the
wastage
the
wreckage
which
he
and
nature
assisting
each
other
so
ably
had
wrought
in
her
she
sat
there
rocking
noisily
waiting
for
the
glare
of
the
lamp
to
cause
him
to
open
his
eyes
and
she
smiled
upon
him
in
exultation
of
vengeance
that
she
was
to
live
on
there
in
his
house
house
after
a
while
a
darker
mood
came
over
her
with
noiseless
steps
lest
she
awake
him
she
began
to
move
about
the
room
she
put
out
the
lamp
and
lighted
her
candle
and
set
it
where
it
would
be
screened
from
his
face
and
where
the
shadow
of
the
chamber
was
heaviest
into
that
shadow
she
retired
and
in
it
she
sat
with
furtive
look
to
see
whether
he
observed
her
a
stillness
deepened
about
the
bed
where
he
lay
running
in
her
veins
a
wellnigh
pure
stream
across
the
generations
was
blood
of
the
world
s
fiercest
floating
in
the
tide
of
it
passions
of
old
family
life
which
had
dyed
history
for
all
time
in
tragedies
of
false
friendship
false
love
and
false
battle
but
fiercest
ever
about
the
marriage
bed
and
the
betrayal
of
its
vow
a
thousand
years
from
this
night
some
wronged
mother
of
hers
sitting
beside
some
sleeping
father
of
hers
in
their
castle
the
moonlight
streaming
in
upon
him
through
the
javelined
casement
and
putting
before
her
the
manly
beauty
of
him
the
blond
hair
matted
thick
on
his
forehead
as
his
helmet
had
left
it
his
mouth
reddening
in
his
slumber
under
its
curling
gold
some
mother
of
hers
whom
he
had
carried
off
from
other
men
by
might
of
his
sword
thus
sitting
beside
him
and
knowing
him
to
be
colder
to
her
now
than
the
moon
s
dead
rays
might
have
watched
those
rays
as
they
travelled
away
from
his
figure
and
put
a
gleam
on
his
sword
hanging
near
a
thousand
years
ago
some
mother
of
hers
it
is
when
the
best
fails
our
human
nature
that
the
worst
volunteers
so
often
to
take
its
place
the
best
and
the
worst
these
are
the
sole
alternatives
which
many
a
soul
seems
to
be
capable
of
making
hence
life
s
spectacle
of
swift
overthrow
of
amazing
collapse
ever
present
about
us
only
the
heroic
among
both
men
and
women
losing
the
best
as
their
first
choice
fight
their
way
through
defeat
to
the
standard
of
the
second
best
and
fight
on
there
and
whatever
one
may
think
of
the
legend
otherwise
abundant
experience
justifies
the
story
that
it
was
the
archangel
who
fell
to
the
pit
the
low
never
fall
far
how
can
they
they
already
dwell
on
the
bottom
of
things
and
many
a
time
they
are
to
be
seen
there
with
vanity
that
they
should
inhabit
such
a
privileged
highland
during
the
first
of
these
hours
which
stretched
for
her
into
the
tragic
duration
of
a
lifetime
it
was
a
successive
falling
from
a
height
of
moral
splendor
her
nature
went
down
through
swift
stages
to
the
lowest
she
harbored
either
in
the
long
channel
of
inheritance
or
as
the
stirred
sediment
of
her
own
imperfections
and
as
is
unfortunately
true
this
descent
into
moral
darkness
possessed
the
grateful
illusion
that
it
was
an
ascent
into
new
light
all
evil
prompting
became
good
suggestion
every
injustice
made
its
claim
to
be
justification
she
enjoyed
the
elation
of
feeling
that
she
was
dragging
herself
out
of
life
s
quicksands
upward
to
some
rock
where
there
might
be
loneliness
for
her
but
where
there
would
be
cleanness
the
love
which
consumed
her
for
him
raged
in
her
as
hatred
and
hatred
is
born
into
perfect
mastery
of
its
weapons
however
young
it
needs
not
to
wait
for
training
in
order
to
know
how
to
destroy
he
presented
himself
to
her
as
a
character
at
last
revealed
in
its
faithlessness
and
low
carnal
propensities
what
rankled
most
poignantly
in
this
spectacle
of
his
final
was
the
fact
that
the
cloven
hoof
should
have
been
found
on
noble
mountain
tops
that
he
should
have
attempted
to
better
his
disguise
by
dwelling
near
regions
of
sublimity
of
all
hypocrisy
the
kind
most
detestable
to
her
was
that
which
dares
live
within
spiritual
fortresses
and
now
his
whole
story
of
the
christmas
tree
the
solemn
marshalling
of
words
about
the
growth
of
the
world
s
spirit
about
the
sacrifice
of
the
lower
in
ourselves
to
the
higher
this
cant
now
became
to
her
the
invocation
and
homage
of
the
practised
impostor
he
had
indeed
carried
the
christmas
tree
on
his
shoulder
into
the
manger
not
the
manger
of
immortal
purity
for
mankind
but
the
manger
of
his
own
bestiality
thus
scorn
and
satire
became
her
speech
she
soared
above
him
with
spurning
a
frenzy
of
poisoned
joy
racked
her
that
at
the
moment
when
he
had
let
her
know
that
he
wanted
to
be
free
at
that
moment
she
might
tell
him
he
had
won
his
freedom
at
the
cheap
price
of
his
unworthiness
and
thus
as
she
descended
she
enjoyed
the
triumph
of
rising
so
the
devil
in
us
never
lacks
argument
that
he
is
the
celestial
guide
moreover
hatred
never
dwells
solitary
it
readily
finds
boon
companions
and
at
one
period
of
the
night
she
began
to
look
back
upon
her
experience
with
a
curious
sense
of
prior
familiarity
to
see
it
as
a
story
already
known
to
her
at
second
hand
she
viewed
it
as
the
first
stage
of
one
of
those
tragedies
that
later
find
their
way
into
the
care
of
family
physicians
into
the
briefs
of
lawyers
into
the
confidence
of
clergymen
into
the
papers
and
divorce
courts
and
that
receive
their
final
flaying
or
canonization
on
the
stage
and
in
novels
of
the
time
sitting
at
a
distance
she
had
within
recent
years
studied
in
a
kind
of
altruistic
absorption
how
the
nation
s
press
the
nation
s
science
of
medicine
the
nation
s
science
of
law
the
nation
s
practice
of
religion
and
the
nation
s
imaginative
literature
were
all
at
work
with
the
same
national
omen
the
decay
of
the
american
family
and
the
downfall
of
the
home
now
this
new
pestilence
raging
in
other
regions
of
the
country
had
incredibly
reached
her
she
thought
on
the
sheltered
lowlands
where
the
older
traditions
of
american
home
life
still
lay
like
foundation
rock
the
corruption
of
it
had
attacked
him
the
ruin
of
it
awaited
her
and
thus
she
took
her
place
among
those
women
whom
the
world
first
hears
of
as
in
hospitals
and
sanitariums
and
places
of
refuge
and
in
their
graves
and
more
sadly
elsewhere
whose
misfortunes
interested
the
press
and
whose
types
attracted
the
novelists
she
was
one
of
them
they
swarmed
about
her
one
by
one
she
recognized
them
the
woman
who
unable
to
bear
up
under
her
tragedy
soon
sinks
into
eternity
or
walks
into
it
the
woman
who
disappears
from
the
scene
and
somewhere
under
another
name
or
with
another
lot
lives
on
devoting
herself
to
memory
or
to
forgetfulness
the
woman
who
stays
on
in
the
house
giving
to
the
world
no
sign
for
the
sake
of
everything
else
that
still
remains
to
her
but
living
apart
on
the
other
side
of
the
locked
door
the
woman
who
stays
on
without
locking
the
door
the
accepted
and
rejected
compromise
the
woman
who
welcomes
the
end
of
the
as
the
beginning
of
peace
and
the
cessation
of
annoyances
the
woman
who
begins
to
act
her
tragedy
to
servants
and
children
and
acquaintances
reaping
sympathy
for
herself
and
sowing
ruin
and
torture
for
him
the
woman
who
drops
the
care
of
house
ends
his
comforts
thus
forcing
the
sharp
reminder
of
her
value
as
at
least
an
investment
toward
his
general
the
woman
who
endeavors
to
rekindle
dying
coals
by
fanning
them
with
fresh
fascinations
the
woman
who
plays
upon
jealousy
and
touches
the
male
instinct
to
keep
one
s
own
though
little
prized
lest
another
acquire
it
and
prize
it
more
the
woman
who
sets
a
watch
to
discover
the
other
woman
they
swarmed
about
her
she
identified
each
and
she
dismissed
them
they
brought
her
no
aid
she
shrank
from
their
companionship
a
strange
dread
moved
her
lest
should
discover
one
only
she
detached
from
the
throng
and
for
a
while
withdrew
with
her
into
a
kind
of
dual
solitude
the
woman
who
when
so
rejected
turns
to
another
man
the
man
who
is
waiting
somewhere
near
the
man
turned
to
who
for
years
had
hovered
near
was
the
country
doctor
her
husband
s
tried
and
closest
friend
whose
children
were
asleep
upstairs
with
her
children
during
all
these
years
secret
had
been
the
doctor
when
she
had
come
as
a
bride
into
that
neighborhood
he
her
husband
s
senior
by
several
years
was
already
well
established
in
his
practice
he
had
attended
her
at
the
birth
of
her
first
child
never
afterwards
as
time
passed
she
had
discovered
that
he
loved
her
she
could
never
have
him
again
this
had
dealt
his
professional
reputation
a
wound
but
he
understood
and
he
welcomed
the
wound
many
a
night
lying
awake
near
her
window
through
which
noises
from
the
turnpike
plainly
reached
her
all
earthly
happiness
asleep
alongside
her
she
could
hear
the
doctor
s
buggy
passing
on
its
way
to
some
patient
or
on
its
return
from
the
town
where
he
had
patients
also
many
a
time
she
had
heard
it
stop
at
the
front
gate
the
road
of
his
life
there
turned
in
to
her
there
were
nights
of
pitch
darkness
and
beating
rain
and
sometimes
on
these
she
had
to
know
that
he
was
out
there
long
she
sat
in
the
shadow
of
her
room
looking
towards
the
bed
where
her
husband
slept
but
sending
the
dallying
vision
toward
the
doctor
he
would
be
at
the
christmas
party
she
would
be
dancing
with
him
clouds
and
darkness
descended
upon
the
plain
of
life
and
enveloped
it
she
groped
her
way
torn
and
wounded
downward
along
the
old
lost
human
paths
the
endless
night
scarcely
moved
on
she
was
wearied
out
she
was
exhausted
there
is
anger
of
such
intensity
that
it
scorches
and
shrivels
away
the
very
temptations
that
are
its
fuel
nothing
can
long
survive
the
blast
of
that
white
flame
and
being
unfed
it
dies
out
moreover
it
is
the
destiny
of
a
portion
of
mankind
that
they
are
enjoined
by
their
very
nobility
from
winning
low
battles
these
always
go
against
them
the
only
victories
for
them
are
won
when
they
are
leading
the
higher
forces
of
human
nature
in
life
s
upward
conflicts
she
was
weary
she
was
exhausted
there
was
in
her
for
a
while
neither
moral
light
nor
moral
darkness
her
consciousness
lay
like
a
boundless
plain
on
which
nothing
is
visible
she
had
passed
into
a
great
calm
and
slowly
there
was
borne
across
her
spirit
a
clearness
that
is
like
the
radiance
of
the
sky
and
now
in
this
calm
in
this
clearness
two
small
white
figures
appeared
her
children
hitherto
the
energies
of
her
mind
had
grappled
with
the
problem
of
her
future
now
memories
began
memories
that
decide
more
perhaps
than
anything
else
for
us
and
memories
began
with
her
children
she
arose
without
making
any
noise
took
her
candle
and
screening
it
with
the
palm
of
her
hand
started
upstairs
there
were
two
ways
by
either
of
which
she
could
go
a
narrow
rear
stairway
leading
from
the
parlor
straight
to
their
bedrooms
and
the
broad
stairway
in
the
front
hall
from
the
old
maternal
she
started
to
take
the
shorter
way
but
thought
of
the
parlor
and
drew
back
this
room
had
become
too
truly
the
judgment
seat
of
the
years
she
shrank
from
it
as
one
who
has
been
arraigned
may
shrink
from
a
tribunal
where
sentence
has
been
pronounced
which
changes
the
rest
of
life
its
flowers
its
fruits
its
toys
its
ribbons
but
deepened
the
derision
and
the
bitterness
and
the
evergreen
there
in
the
middle
of
the
room
it
became
to
her
as
that
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
which
at
creation
s
morning
had
driven
woman
from
paradise
she
chose
the
other
way
and
started
toward
the
main
hall
of
the
house
but
paused
in
the
doorway
and
looked
back
at
the
bed
what
if
he
should
awake
in
the
dark
alone
with
no
knowledge
of
where
she
was
would
he
call
out
to
her
with
what
voice
would
he
come
to
seek
her
with
what
emotions
the
tide
of
memories
was
setting
in
now
the
drift
back
to
the
old
mooring
hunt
for
her
how
those
words
fell
like
iron
strokes
on
the
ear
of
remembrance
they
registered
the
beginning
of
the
whole
trouble
up
to
the
last
two
years
his
first
act
upon
reaching
home
had
been
to
seek
her
it
had
even
been
her
playfulness
at
times
to
slip
from
room
to
room
for
the
delight
of
proving
how
persistently
he
would
prolong
his
search
but
one
day
some
two
years
before
this
when
she
had
entered
his
study
about
the
usual
hour
of
his
return
bringing
flowers
for
his
writing
desk
she
saw
him
sitting
there
hat
on
driving
gloves
on
making
some
notes
the
sight
had
struck
the
flowers
from
her
hands
she
swiftly
gathered
them
up
and
going
to
her
room
shut
herself
in
she
knew
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
the
shadow
which
lurks
in
every
bridal
lamp
had
become
the
spectre
of
the
bedchamber
when
they
met
later
that
day
he
was
not
even
aware
of
what
he
had
done
or
failed
to
do
the
change
in
him
was
so
natural
to
himself
everything
else
had
followed
the
old
look
dying
out
of
the
eyes
the
old
touch
abandoning
the
hands
less
time
for
her
in
the
house
more
for
work
constraint
beginning
between
them
the
awkwardness
of
reserve
she
seeing
nature
s
movement
yet
refusing
to
believe
it
then
at
last
resolving
to
know
to
the
uttermost
and
choosing
her
bridal
night
as
the
hour
of
the
ordeal
if
he
awoke
would
he
come
to
seek
her
with
what
feelings
she
went
on
upstairs
holding
the
candle
to
one
side
with
her
right
hand
and
supporting
herself
by
the
banisters
with
her
left
there
was
a
turn
in
the
stairway
at
the
second
floor
and
here
the
candle
rays
fell
on
the
face
of
the
tall
clock
in
the
hallway
she
sat
down
on
a
step
putting
the
candle
beside
her
and
there
she
remained
her
elbows
on
her
knees
her
face
resting
on
her
palms
and
into
the
abyss
of
the
night
dropped
the
tranquil
strokes
more
memories
she
was
by
nature
not
only
alive
to
all
life
but
alive
to
surrounding
lifeless
things
much
alone
in
the
house
she
had
sent
her
happiness
overflowing
its
dumb
environs
humanizing
these
drawing
them
toward
her
by
a
gracious
responsive
symbolism
extending
speech
over
realms
which
nature
has
not
yet
awakened
to
it
or
which
she
may
have
struck
into
speechlessness
long
æons
past
she
had
symbolized
the
clock
it
was
the
wooden
god
of
hours
she
had
often
feigned
that
it
might
be
propitiated
and
opening
the
door
of
it
she
would
pin
inside
the
walls
little
clusters
of
blossoms
as
votive
offerings
if
it
would
only
move
faster
and
bring
him
home
the
usual
hour
of
his
return
from
college
was
three
in
the
afternoon
she
had
symbolized
that
hour
one
stroke
for
him
one
for
her
one
for
the
children
the
three
in
one
the
trinity
of
the
household
she
sat
there
on
the
step
with
the
candle
burning
beside
her
the
clock
struck
three
the
sound
went
through
the
house
down
to
him
up
to
the
children
into
her
it
was
like
a
cry
of
a
night
watch
all
is
well
it
was
the
first
sound
that
had
reached
her
from
any
source
during
this
agony
and
now
it
did
not
come
from
humanity
but
from
outside
humanity
from
time
itself
which
brings
us
together
and
holds
us
together
as
long
as
possible
and
then
separates
us
and
goes
on
its
way
indifferent
whether
we
are
together
or
apart
time
which
welds
the
sands
into
the
rock
and
then
wears
the
rock
away
to
its
separate
sands
and
sends
the
level
tide
softly
over
them
once
for
him
once
for
her
once
for
the
children
she
took
up
the
candle
and
went
upstairs
to
them
for
a
while
she
stood
beside
the
bed
in
one
room
where
the
two
little
girls
were
asleep
clasping
each
other
cheek
against
cheek
and
in
another
room
at
the
bedside
of
the
two
little
boys
their
backs
turned
on
one
another
and
each
with
a
hand
doubled
into
a
promising
fist
outside
the
cover
in
a
few
years
how
differently
the
four
would
be
divided
and
paired
each
boy
a
young
husband
each
girl
a
young
wife
and
out
of
the
lives
of
the
two
of
them
who
were
hers
she
would
then
drop
into
some
second
place
if
she
were
realizing
what
befalls
a
wife
when
she
becomes
the
incident
to
her
husband
she
would
then
realize
what
befalls
a
woman
when
the
mother
becomes
the
incident
to
her
children
woman
twice
the
incident
in
nature
s
impartial
economy
her
son
would
playfully
confide
it
to
his
bride
that
she
must
bear
with
his
mother
s
whims
and
ways
her
daughter
would
caution
her
husband
that
he
must
overlook
peculiarities
and
weaknesses
the
very
study
of
perfection
which
she
herself
had
kindled
and
fanned
in
them
as
the
illumination
of
their
lives
they
would
now
turn
upon
her
as
a
searchlight
of
her
failings
he
downstairs
would
never
do
that
she
could
not
conceive
of
his
discussing
her
with
any
human
being
even
though
he
should
some
day
desert
her
he
would
never
discuss
her
she
had
lived
so
secure
in
the
sense
of
him
thus
standing
with
her
against
the
world
that
it
was
the
sheer
withdrawal
of
his
strength
from
her
that
had
dealt
her
the
cruelest
blow
but
now
she
began
to
ask
herself
whether
his
protection
failed
her
could
he
have
recognized
the
situation
without
rendering
it
worse
had
he
put
his
arms
around
her
might
she
not
have
struck
at
him
had
he
laid
a
of
sympathy
on
her
would
it
not
have
left
a
scar
for
life
any
words
of
his
would
they
not
have
rung
in
her
ears
unceasingly
to
pass
it
over
was
as
though
it
had
never
been
was
not
his
protection
she
suddenly
felt
a
desire
to
go
down
into
the
parlor
she
kissed
her
child
in
each
room
and
she
returned
and
kissed
the
doctor
s
children
with
memory
of
their
mother
and
then
she
descended
by
the
rear
stairway
she
set
her
candle
on
the
table
where
earlier
in
the
night
she
had
placed
the
lamp
near
the
manuscript
and
she
sat
down
and
looked
at
that
remorsefully
she
had
ignored
it
when
he
placed
it
there
he
had
made
her
the
gift
of
his
work
dedicated
to
her
the
triumphs
of
his
toil
it
was
his
deep
cry
to
her
to
share
with
him
his
widening
career
and
enter
with
him
into
the
world
s
service
she
crossed
her
hands
over
it
awhile
and
then
she
left
it
the
candle
did
not
penetrate
far
into
the
darkness
of
the
immense
parlor
there
was
an
easy
chair
near
her
piano
and
her
music
after
playing
when
alone
she
would
often
sit
there
and
listen
to
the
echoes
of
those
influences
that
come
into
the
soul
from
music
only
the
rhythmic
hauntings
of
some
heaven
of
diviner
beauty
she
sat
there
now
quite
in
darkness
and
closed
her
eyes
and
upon
her
ear
began
faintly
to
beat
the
sad
sublime
tones
of
his
story
one
of
her
delights
in
growing
things
on
the
farm
had
been
to
watch
the
youth
of
the
hemp
a
field
of
it
tall
and
wandlike
and
tufted
if
the
north
wind
blew
upon
it
the
myriad
stalks
as
by
a
common
impulse
swayed
southward
if
a
zephyr
from
the
south
crossed
it
all
heads
were
instantly
bowed
before
the
north
west
wind
sent
it
east
and
east
wind
sent
it
west
and
so
it
had
seemed
to
her
is
that
ever
living
world
which
we
sometimes
call
the
field
of
human
life
in
its
perpetual
summer
it
is
run
through
by
many
different
laws
governed
by
many
distinct
forces
each
of
which
strives
to
control
it
wholly
but
never
does
selfishness
blows
on
it
like
a
parching
sirocco
and
all
things
seem
to
bow
to
the
might
of
selfishness
generosity
moves
across
the
expanse
and
all
things
are
seen
responsive
to
what
is
generous
place
yourself
where
life
is
lowest
and
everything
like
an
avalanche
is
rushing
to
the
bottom
place
yourself
where
character
is
highest
and
lo
the
whole
world
is
but
one
struggle
upward
to
what
is
high
you
see
what
you
care
to
see
and
find
what
you
wish
to
find
in
his
story
of
the
forest
and
the
heart
he
had
wanted
to
trace
but
one
law
and
he
had
traced
it
he
had
drawn
all
things
together
and
bent
them
before
its
majesty
the
ancient
law
of
sacrifice
of
old
the
high
sacrificed
to
the
low
afterwards
the
low
to
the
high
once
the
sacrifice
of
others
now
the
sacrifice
of
ourselves
but
always
in
ourselves
of
the
lower
to
the
higher
in
order
that
dying
we
may
live
with
this
law
he
had
made
his
story
a
story
of
the
world
the
star
on
the
tree
bore
it
back
to
chaldæa
the
candle
bore
it
to
ancient
persia
the
cross
bore
it
to
the
nile
and
isis
and
osiris
the
dove
bore
it
to
syria
the
bell
bore
it
to
confucius
the
drum
bore
it
to
buddha
the
drinking
horn
to
greece
the
tinsel
to
romulus
and
rome
the
doll
to
abraham
and
isaac
the
masks
to
gaul
the
mistletoe
to
britain
and
all
brought
it
to
christ
christ
the
latest
of
sacrifice
that
is
and
of
the
giving
of
all
for
all
the
story
was
for
herself
he
had
said
and
for
himself
himself
here
at
last
all
her
pain
and
wandering
of
this
night
ended
at
the
bottom
of
her
wound
where
rankled
from
this
problem
she
had
most
shrunk
and
into
this
she
now
entered
she
sacrificed
herself
in
him
she
laid
upon
herself
his
temptation
and
his
struggle
taking
her
candle
she
passed
back
into
her
bedroom
and
screened
it
where
she
had
screened
it
before
then
went
into
his
bedroom
she
put
her
wedding
ring
on
again
with
blanched
lips
she
went
to
his
bedside
and
drawing
to
the
pillow
the
chair
on
which
his
clothes
were
piled
sat
down
and
laid
her
face
over
on
it
and
there
in
that
shrine
of
feeling
where
speech
is
formed
but
whence
it
never
issues
she
made
her
last
communion
with
him
you
to
whom
i
gave
my
youth
and
all
that
youth
could
mean
to
me
whose
children
i
have
borne
and
nurtured
at
my
breast
all
of
whose
eyes
i
have
seen
open
and
the
eyes
of
some
of
whom
i
have
closed
husband
of
my
girlhood
loved
as
no
woman
ever
loved
the
man
who
took
her
home
strength
and
laughter
of
his
house
helper
of
what
is
best
in
me
my
defender
against
things
in
myself
that
i
can
not
govern
pathfinder
of
my
future
rock
of
the
ebbing
years
though
my
hair
turn
white
as
driven
snow
and
flesh
wither
to
the
bone
i
shall
never
cease
to
be
the
flame
that
you
yourself
have
kindled
but
never
again
to
you
let
the
stillness
of
nature
fall
where
there
must
be
stillness
peace
come
with
its
peace
and
the
room
which
heard
our
whisperings
of
the
night
let
it
be
the
room
of
the
silences
the
long
silences
adieu
cross
of
living
fire
that
i
have
so
clung
to
adieu
adieu
adieu
adieu
she
remained
as
motionless
as
though
she
had
fallen
asleep
or
would
not
lift
her
head
until
there
had
ebbed
out
of
her
life
upon
his
pillow
the
last
drop
of
things
that
must
go
she
there
her
whitening
head
buried
on
his
pillow
it
was
life
s
calvary
of
the
snows
the
dawn
found
her
sitting
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
room
and
there
it
brightened
about
her
desolately
the
moment
drew
near
when
she
must
awaken
him
the
ordeal
of
their
meeting
must
be
over
before
the
children
rushed
downstairs
or
the
servants
knocked
she
had
plaited
her
hair
in
two
heavy
braids
and
down
each
braid
the
gray
told
its
story
through
the
black
and
she
had
brushed
it
frankly
away
from
brow
and
temples
so
that
the
contour
of
her
head
one
of
nature
s
noblest
was
seen
in
its
simplicity
it
is
thus
that
the
women
of
her
land
sometimes
prepare
themselves
at
the
ceremony
of
their
baptism
into
a
new
life
she
had
put
on
a
plain
and
her
face
and
shoulders
rising
out
of
this
had
the
austerity
of
marble
exempt
not
from
ruin
but
exempt
from
lesser
mutation
she
looked
down
at
her
wrists
once
and
made
a
little
instinctive
movement
with
her
fingers
as
if
to
hide
them
under
the
sleeves
then
she
approached
the
bed
as
she
did
so
she
turned
back
midway
and
quickly
stretched
her
arms
toward
the
wall
as
though
to
flee
to
it
then
she
drew
nearer
a
new
pitiful
fear
of
him
in
her
eyes
the
look
of
the
rejected
so
she
stood
an
instant
and
then
she
reclined
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
resting
on
one
elbow
and
looking
down
at
him
for
years
her
first
words
to
him
on
this
day
had
been
the
world
s
best
greeting
a
merry
christmas
she
tried
to
summon
the
words
to
her
lips
and
have
them
ready
at
the
pressure
of
her
body
on
the
bed
he
opened
his
eyes
and
instantly
looked
to
see
what
the
whole
truth
was
how
she
had
come
out
of
it
all
what
their
life
was
to
be
henceforth
what
their
future
would
be
worth
but
at
the
sight
of
her
so
changed
something
so
gone
out
of
her
forever
with
a
quick
cry
he
reached
his
arms
for
her
she
struggled
to
get
away
from
him
but
he
winding
his
arms
shelteringly
about
the
head
drew
her
face
close
down
against
his
face
she
caught
at
one
of
the
braids
of
her
hair
and
threw
it
across
her
eyes
and
then
silent
convulsive
sobs
rent
and
tore
her
tore
her
the
torrent
of
her
tears
raining
down
into
his
tears
tears
not
for
life
s
faults
but
for
life
when
there
are
no
faults
they
locked
in
each
other
s
arms
trying
to
save
each
other
on
nature
s
vast
lonely
tossing
uncaring
sea
the
rush
of
children
s
feet
was
heard
in
the
hall
and
there
was
smothered
laughter
at
the
door
and
the
soft
turning
of
the
knob
it
was
christmas
morning
the
sun
rose
golden
and
gathering
up
its
gold
threw
it
forward
over
the
gladness
of
the
shield
the
farmhouse
such
as
the
poet
had
sung
of
when
he
could
not
help
singing
of
american
home
life
looked
out
from
under
its
winter
roof
with
the
cheeriness
of
a
human
traveller
who
laughs
at
the
snow
on
his
hat
and
shoulders
smoke
poured
out
of
its
chimneys
bespeaking
brisk
fires
for
festive
purposes
the
oak
tree
beside
it
stood
quieted
of
its
moaning
and
tossing
soon
after
sunrise
a
soul
of
passion
on
scarlet
wings
rising
out
of
the
shrubbery
flew
up
to
a
topmost
twig
of
the
oak
and
sitting
there
with
its
breast
to
the
gorgeous
sun
scanned
for
a
little
while
that
landscape
of
ice
it
was
beyond
its
intelligence
to
understand
how
nature
could
create
it
for
summer
and
then
take
summer
away
its
wisdom
could
only
have
ended
in
wonderment
that
a
sun
so
true
could
shine
on
a
world
so
false
frolicking
servants
fell
to
work
sweeping
porches
and
shovelling
paths
after
breakfast
a
man
his
face
red
with
fireside
warmth
and
laughter
without
hat
or
gloves
or
overcoat
rushed
out
of
the
front
door
pursued
by
a
little
soldier
sternly
booted
and
capped
and
gloved
and
the
two
snowballed
each
other
going
at
it
furiously
watching
them
through
a
window
a
little
girl
dancing
a
dreamy
measure
of
her
own
ever
turned
inward
and
beckoned
to
some
one
to
come
and
look
beckoned
in
vain
all
day
the
little
boy
beat
the
drum
of
confucius
all
day
the
little
girl
played
with
the
doll
hugged
to
her
breast
the
symbol
of
ancient
sacrifice
the
emblem
of
the
world
s
new
mercy
along
the
turnpike
were
borne
hither
and
thither
by
rushing
horses
and
the
shouts
of
young
men
on
fire
to
their
marrow
went
echoing
across
the
shining
valleys
christmas
day
christmas
day
christmas
day
one
thing
about
the
house
stood
in
tragic
aloofness
from
its
surroundings
just
outside
the
bedroom
window
grew
a
cedar
low
thick
covered
with
snow
except
where
a
bough
had
been
broken
off
for
decorating
the
house
here
owing
to
the
steepness
the
snow
slid
off
the
spot
looked
like
a
wound
in
the
side
of
the
divine
purity
and
across
this
open
wound
the
tree
had
hung
its
never
to
be
told
by
sorrow
s
fingers
the
sunset
golden
and
gathering
up
its
last
gold
threw
it
backward
across
the
sadness
of
the
shield
one
by
one
the
stars
came
back
to
their
faithful
places
above
the
silence
and
the
whiteness
a
swinging
lamp
was
lighted
on
the
front
porch
and
its
rays
fell
on
little
round
mats
of
snow
stamped
off
by
entering
boot
heels
on
each
gatepost
a
low
christmas
star
was
set
to
guide
and
welcome
good
neighbors
and
between
those
beacons
soon
they
came
hurrying
fathers
and
mothers
and
children
assembling
for
the
party
late
into
the
night
the
party
lasted
the
logs
blazed
in
deep
fireplaces
and
their
forest
memories
went
to
ashes
bodily
comfort
there
was
and
and
good
wishes
and
the
robust
sensible
making
the
best
of
what
is
best
on
the
surface
of
our
life
and
hale
eating
and
drinking
as
old
england
itself
once
ate
and
drank
at
yuletide
and
fast
music
and
dancing
that
ever
wanted
to
go
faster
than
the
music
the
chief
feature
of
the
revelry
was
the
distribution
of
gifts
on
the
christmas
tree
the
handing
over
to
this
person
and
to
that
person
of
those
unread
lessons
of
the
ages
little
mummied
packages
of
the
lord
of
time
one
thing
no
one
noted
fresh
candles
had
replaced
those
burnt
out
on
the
tree
the
night
before
all
the
candles
were
white
now
revellers
revellers
a
crowded
canvas
a
brilliantly
painted
scene
controlling
everything
controlling
herself
the
lady
of
the
house
hunting
out
her
guests
with
some
grace
that
befitted
each
laughing
and
talking
with
the
doctor
secretly
giving
most
attention
to
the
doctor
s
wife
faded
little
sufferer
with
strength
in
her
to
be
the
american
wife
and
mother
in
the
home
of
the
poet
s
dream
the
spiritual
majesty
of
her
bridal
veil
still
about
her
amid
life
s
snow
as
it
never
lifts
itself
from
the
face
of
the
amid
the
sad
most
lovely
mountains
the
american
wife
and
mother
herself
the
among
the
world
s
women
the
last
thing
before
the
company
broke
up
took
place
what
often
takes
place
there
in
happy
gatherings
the
singing
of
the
song
of
the
state
which
is
also
a
song
of
the
nation
its
melody
of
the
unfallen
home
with
sadness
enough
in
it
god
knows
but
with
sanctity
she
seated
at
the
piano
the
others
upholding
her
like
a
living
bulwark
there
was
another
company
thronging
the
rooms
that
no
one
wot
of
those
bodiless
ones
that
often
are
much
more
real
than
the
embodied
the
guests
of
the
imagination
the
memories
were
there
strolling
back
and
forth
through
the
chambers
arm
and
arm
with
the
years
bestowing
no
cognizance
upon
that
present
scene
nor
aware
that
they
were
not
alone
about
the
christmas
tree
the
wraiths
of
earlier
children
returned
to
gambol
and
these
knew
naught
of
those
later
ones
who
had
strangely
come
out
of
the
unknown
to
fill
their
places
around
the
walls
stood
other
majestical
veiled
shapes
that
bent
undivided
attention
upon
the
actual
pageant
these
were
life
s
pities
ever
and
anon
they
would
lift
their
noble
veils
and
look
out
upon
that
brief
flicker
of
our
mortal
joy
and
drop
them
and
relapse
into
their
compassionate
vigil
but
of
the
bodiless
ones
there
gathered
a
solitary
young
shape
filled
the
entire
house
with
her
presence
as
the
memories
walked
through
the
rooms
with
the
years
they
paused
ever
before
her
and
mutely
beckoned
her
to
a
place
in
their
sisterhood
the
children
who
had
wandered
back
peeped
shyly
at
her
but
then
with
some
sure
instinct
of
recognition
ran
to
her
and
threw
down
their
gifts
to
put
their
arms
around
her
and
the
pities
before
they
left
the
house
that
night
walked
past
her
one
by
one
and
each
lifted
its
veil
and
dropped
it
more
softly
this
was
the
shape
in
the
great
bedroom
on
a
spot
of
the
carpet
under
the
chandelier
which
had
no
decoration
whatsoever
stood
an
exquisite
spirit
of
youth
more
insubstantial
than
spring
morning
mist
yet
most
alive
her
lips
scarce
parted
her
skin
like
white
hawthorn
shadowed
by
pink
in
her
eyes
the
modesty
of
withdrawal
from
love
in
her
heart
the
surrender
to
it
during
those
distracting
hours
never
did
she
move
nor
did
her
look
once
change
she
waiting
there
waiting
for
some
one
to
come
waiting
waiting
