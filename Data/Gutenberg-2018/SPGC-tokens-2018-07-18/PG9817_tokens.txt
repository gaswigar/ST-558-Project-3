an
introduction

his
cousin

madge

edited
and

part
one
introduction
the
writer
of
this
singular
autobiography
was
my
cousin
who
died
at
the
criminal
lunatic
asylum
of
which
he
had
been
an
inmate
three
years
he
had
been
removed
thither
after
a
sudden
and
violent
attack
of
homicidal
mania
which
fortunately
led
to
no
serious
consequences
from
jail
where
he
had
spent
years
having
been
condemned
to
penal
servitude
for
life
for
the
murder
of
his
relative
he
had
been
originally
sentenced
to
death
it
was
at
lunatic
asylum
that
he
wrote
these
memoirs
and
i
received
the
soon
after
his
decease
with
the
most
touching
letter
appealing
to
our
early
friendship
and
appointing
me
his
literary
executrix
it
was
his
wish
that
the
story
of
his
life
should
be
published
just
as
he
had
written
it
i
have
found
it
unadvisable
to
do
this
it
would
revive
to
no
useful
purpose
an
old
scandal
long
buried
and
forgotten
and
thereby
give
pain
or
annoyance
to
people
who
are
still
alive
nor
does
his
memory
require
rehabilitation
among
those
who
knew
him
or
knew
anything
of
him
the
only
people
really
concerned
his
dreadful
deed
has
long
been
condoned
by
all
and
they
are
many
who
knew
the
provocation
he
had
received
and
the
character
of
the
man
who
had
provoked
him
on
mature
consideration
and
with
advice
i
resolved
in
order
that
his
dying
wishes
should
not
be
frustrated
altogether
to
publish
the
memoir
with
certain
alterations
and
emendations
i
have
nearly
everywhere
changed
the
names
of
people
and
places
suppressed
certain
details
and
omitted
some
passages
of
his
life
most
of
the
story
of
his
for
instance
and
that
of
his
brief
career
as
a
private
in
the
horse
guards
lest
they
should
too
easily
lead
to
the
identification
and
annoyance
of
people
still
alive
for
he
is
strongly
personal
at
times
and
perhaps
not
always
just
and
some
other
events
i
have
carefully
paraphrased
notably
his
trial
at
the
old
bailey
and
given
for
them
as
careful
an
equivalent
as
i
could
manage
without
too
great
a
loss
of
verisimilitude
i
may
as
well
state
at
once
that
allowing
for
these
alterations
every
incident
of
his
life
as
described
by
himself
is
absolutely
true
to
the
minutest
detail
as
i
have
been
able
to
ascertain
for
the
early
part
of
it
the
life
at
passy
he
describes
with
such
affection
i
can
vouch
personally
i
am
the
cousin
madge
to
whom
he
once
or
twice
refers
i
well
remember
the
genial
abode
where
he
lived
with
his
parents
my
dear
uncle
and
aunt
and
the
lovely
madame
seraskier
and
her
husband
and
daughter
and
their
house
parva
sed
apta
and
major
duquesnois
and
the
rest
and
although
i
have
never
seen
him
since
he
was
twelve
years
old
when
his
parents
died
and
he
went
to
london
as
most
of
my
life
has
been
spent
abroad
i
received
occasional
letters
from
him
i
have
also
been
able
to
obtain
much
information
about
him
from
others
especially
from
a
relative
of
the
late
and
lintot
who
knew
him
well
and
from
several
officers
in
his
regiment
who
remembered
him
also
from
the
vicar
daughter
whom
he
met
at
lady
cray
and
who
perfectly
recollects
the
conversation
she
had
with
him
at
dinner
his
sudden
indisposition
and
his
long
interview
with
the
duchess
of
towers
under
the
next
morning
she
was
one
of
the
he
was
the
most
beautiful
boy
i
ever
saw
and
so
charming
lively
and
amiable
that
everybody
was
fond
of
him
he
had
a
horror
of
cruelty
especially
to
animals
quite
singular
in
a
boy
of
his
age
and
was
very
truthful
and
brave
according
to
all
accounts
and
from
a
photograph
in
my
possession
he
grew
up
to
be
as
handsome
as
a
man
can
well
be
a
personal
gift
which
he
seems
to
have
held
of
no
account
whatever
though
he
thought
so
much
of
it
in
others
but
he
also
became
singularly
shy
and
reserved
in
manner
and
of
a
melancholy
disposition
loving
solitude
living
much
alone
and
taking
nobody
into
his
confidence
and
yet
inspiring
both
affection
and
respect
for
he
seems
to
have
always
been
thoroughly
gentlemanlike
in
speech
bearing
manner
and
aspect
it
is
possible
although
he
does
not
say
so
that
having
first
enlisted
and
then
entered
upon
a
professional
career
under
somewhat
inauspicious
conditions
he
felt
himself
to
have
fallen
away
from
the
social
rank
such
as
it
was
that
belonged
to
him
by
birth
and
he
may
have
found
his
associates
uncongenial
his
old
letters
to
me
are
charmingly
open
and
effusive
of
the
lady
whom
keeping
her
title
and
altering
her
name
i
have
called
the
duchess
of
towers
i
find
it
difficult
to
speak
that
they
only
met
twice
and
in
the
way
he
describes
is
a
fact
about
which
there
can
be
no
doubt
it
is
also
indubitable
that
he
received
in
newgate
on
the
morning
after
his
sentence
to
death
an
envelope
containing
violets
and
the
strange
message
he
mentions
both
letter
and
violets
are
in
my
possession
and
the
words
are
in
her
handwriting
about
that
there
can
be
no
mistake
it
is
certain
moreover
that
she
separated
from
her
husband
almost
immediately
after
my
cousin
trial
and
condemnation
and
lived
in
comparative
retirement
from
the
world
as
it
is
certain
that
he
went
suddenly
mad
years
later
in
jail
a
few
hours
after
her
tragic
death
and
before
he
could
possibly
have
heard
of
it
by
the
ordinary
channels
and
that
he
was
sent
to
asylum
where
after
his
frenzy
had
subsided
he
remained
for
many
days
in
a
state
of
suicidal
melancholia
until
to
the
surprise
of
all
he
rose
one
morning
in
high
spirits
and
apparently
cured
of
all
serious
symptoms
of
insanity
so
he
remained
until
his
death
it
was
during
the
last
year
of
his
life
that
he
wrote
his
autobiography
in
french
and
english
there
is
nothing
to
be
surprised
at
taking
all
the
circumstances
into
consideration
that
even
so
great
a
lady
the
friend
of
queens
and
empresses
the
bearer
of
a
high
title
and
an
illustrious
name
justly
celebrated
for
her
beauty
and
charm
and
her
endless
charities
of
blameless
repute
and
one
of
the
most
popular
women
in
english
society
should
yet
have
conceived
a
very
warm
regard
for
my
poor
cousin
indeed
it
was
an
open
secret
in
the
family
of
lord
cray
that
she
had
done
so
but
for
them
she
would
have
taken
the
whole
world
into
her
confidence
after
her
death
she
left
him
what
money
had
come
to
her
from
her
father
which
he
disposed
of
for
charitable
ends
and
an
immense
quantity
of
in
cipher
a
cipher
which
is
evidently
identical
with
that
he
used
himself
in
the
annotations
he
put
under
innumerable
sketches
he
was
allowed
to
make
during
his
long
period
of
confinement
which
through
her
interest
and
no
doubt
through
his
own
good
conduct
was
rendered
as
bearable
to
him
as
possible
these
sketches
which
are
very
extraordinary
and
her
grace
are
now
in
my
possession
they
constitute
a
mystery
into
which
i
have
not
dared
to
pry
from
papers
belonging
to
both
i
have
been
able
to
establish
beyond
doubt
the
fact
so
strangely
discovered
of
their
descent
from
a
common
french
ancestress
whose
name
i
have
but
slightly
modified
and
the
tradition
of
whom
still
lingers
in
the
departement
de
la
sarthe
where
she
was
a
famous
person
a
century
ago
and
her
violin
a
valuable
amati
now
belongs
to
me
of
the
part
of
his
story
i
will
not
say
much
it
is
of
course
a
fact
that
he
had
been
absolutely
and
to
all
appearance
incurably
insane
before
he
wrote
his
life
there
seems
to
have
been
a
difference
of
opinion
or
rather
a
doubt
among
the
authorities
of
the
asylum
as
to
whether
he
was
mad
after
the
acute
but
very
violent
period
of
his
brief
attack
had
ended
whichever
may
have
been
the
case
i
am
at
least
convinced
of
this
that
he
was
no
romancer
and
thoroughly
believed
in
the
extraordinary
mental
experience
he
has
revealed
at
the
risk
of
being
thought
to
share
his
madness
if
he
mad
i
will
conclude
by
saying
that
i
for
one
believe
him
to
have
been
sane
and
to
have
told
the
truth
all
through
madge
plunket
i
am
but
a
poor
scribe
in
the
craft
of
wielding
words
and
phrases
as
the
cultivated
reader
if
i
should
ever
happen
to
have
one
will
no
doubt
very
soon
find
out
for
himself
illustration
i
have
been
for
many
years
an
object
of
pity
and
contempt
to
all
who
ever
gave
me
a
thought
to
all
but
yet
of
all
that
ever
lived
on
this
earth
i
have
been
perhaps
the
happiest
and
most
privileged
as
that
reader
will
discover
if
he
perseveres
to
the
end
my
outer
and
my
inner
life
have
been
as
the
very
poles
asunder
and
if
at
the
eleventh
hour
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
give
my
story
to
the
world
it
is
not
in
order
to
rehabilitate
myself
in
the
eyes
of
my
deeply
as
i
value
their
good
opinion
for
i
have
always
loved
them
and
wished
them
well
and
would
fain
express
my
goodwill
and
win
theirs
if
that
were
possible
it
is
because
the
regions
where
i
have
found
my
felicity
are
accessible
to
all
and
that
many
better
trained
and
better
gifted
will
explore
them
to
far
better
purpose
than
i
and
to
the
greater
glory
and
benefit
of
mankind
when
once
i
have
given
them
the
clew
before
i
can
do
this
and
in
order
to
show
how
i
came
by
this
clew
myself
i
must
tell
as
well
as
i
may
the
tale
of
my
checkered
career
in
telling
which
moreover
i
am
obeying
the
last
behest
of
one
whose
lightest
wish
was
my
law
if
i
am
more
prolix
than
i
need
be
it
must
be
set
down
to
my
want
of
experience
in
the
art
of
literary
composition
to
a
natural
wish
i
have
to
show
myself
neither
better
nor
worse
than
i
believe
myself
to
be
to
the
charm
the
unspeakable
charm
that
personal
reminiscences
have
for
the
person
principally
concerned
and
which
he
can
not
hope
to
impart
however
keenly
he
may
feel
it
without
gifts
and
advantages
that
have
been
denied
to
me
and
this
leads
me
to
apologize
for
the
egotism
of
this
memoir
which
is
but
an
introduction
to
another
and
longer
one
that
i
hope
to
publish
later
to
write
a
story
of
paramount
importance
to
mankind
it
is
true
but
all
about
one
outer
and
one
inner
self
to
do
this
without
seeming
somewhat
egotistical
requires
something
akin
to
genius
and
i
am
but
a
poor
scribe
douce
souvenance
du
joli
lieu
de
ma
these
quaint
lines
have
been
running
in
my
head
at
intervals
through
nearly
all
my
outer
life
like
an
burden
in
an
endless
ballad
sadly
monotonous
alas
the
ballad
which
is
mine
sweetly
monotonous
the
burden
which
is
by
châteaubriand
i
sometimes
think
that
to
feel
the
full
significance
of
this
refrain
one
must
have
passed
one
childhood
in
sunny
france
where
it
was
written
and
the
remainder
of
one
existence
in
mere
london
or
worse
than
mere
london
as
has
been
the
case
with
me
if
i
had
spent
all
my
life
from
infancy
upward
in
bloomsbury
or
clerkenwell
or
whitechapel
my
early
days
would
be
shorn
of
much
of
their
retrospective
glamour
as
i
look
back
on
them
in
these
my
combien
douce
souvenance
it
was
on
a
beautiful
june
morning
in
a
charming
french
garden
where
the
warm
sweet
atmosphere
was
laden
with
the
scent
of
lilac
and
syringa
and
gay
with
butterflies
and
and
humblebees
that
i
began
my
conscious
existence
with
the
happiest
day
of
all
my
outer
life
it
is
true
that
i
had
vague
memories
with
many
a
blank
between
of
a
dingy
house
in
the
heart
of
london
in
a
long
street
of
desolating
straightness
that
led
to
a
dreary
square
and
back
again
and
nowhere
else
for
me
and
then
of
a
troubled
and
exciting
journey
that
seemed
of
jumbled
days
and
nights
i
could
recall
the
blue
with
the
four
tall
thin
brown
horses
so
quiet
and
modest
and
the
guard
and
his
horn
the
driver
and
his
husky
voice
and
many
capes
then
the
steamer
with
its
glistening
deck
so
beautiful
and
white
it
seemed
quite
a
desecration
to
walk
upon
it
this
spotlessness
did
not
last
very
long
and
then
two
wooden
piers
with
a
on
each
and
a
quay
and
workmen
and
little
soldiers
with
mustaches
and
all
speaking
a
language
that
i
knew
as
well
as
the
other
commoner
language
i
had
left
behind
but
which
i
had
always
looked
upon
as
an
exclusive
possession
of
my
father
and
mother
and
mine
for
the
exchange
of
sweet
confidence
and
the
bewilderment
of
outsiders
and
here
were
little
boys
and
girls
in
the
street
quite
common
children
who
spoke
it
as
well
and
better
than
i
did
myself
after
this
came
the
dream
of
a
strange
huge
vehicle
that
seemed
like
three
yellow
carriages
stuck
together
and
a
mountain
of
luggage
at
the
top
under
an
immense
black
tarpaulin
which
ended
in
a
hood
and
beneath
the
hood
sat
a
man
with
a
singular
cap
like
a
concertina
and
mustaches
who
cracked
a
loud
whip
over
five
squealing
fussy
pugnacious
white
and
gray
horses
with
bells
on
their
necks
and
bushy
on
their
foreheads
and
their
own
tails
carefully
tucked
up
behind
from
the
where
i
sat
with
my
father
and
mother
i
could
watch
them
well
as
they
led
us
through
dusty
roads
with
endless
or
poplars
on
either
side
little
barefooted
urchins
whose
papas
and
mammas
wore
wooden
shoes
and
funny
white
nightcaps
ran
after
us
for
french
which
were
larger
than
english
ones
and
pleasanter
to
have
and
to
hold
up
hill
and
down
we
went
over
sounding
wooden
bridges
through
roughly
paved
streets
in
pretty
towns
to
large
where
five
other
quarrelsome
steeds
gray
and
white
were
waiting
to
take
the
place
of
the
old
ones
worn
out
but
quarreling
still
and
through
the
night
i
could
hear
the
gay
music
of
the
bells
and
hoofs
the
rumbling
of
the
wheels
the
cracking
of
the
eternal
whip
as
i
fidgeted
from
one
familiar
lap
to
the
other
in
search
of
sleep
and
waking
out
of
a
doze
i
could
see
the
glare
of
the
red
lamps
on
the
five
straining
white
and
gray
backs
that
dragged
us
so
gallantly
through
the
dark
summer
night
illustration
a
strange
huge
vehicle
then
it
all
became
rather
tiresome
and
intermittent
and
confused
till
we
reached
at
dusk
next
day
a
quay
by
a
broad
river
and
as
we
drove
along
it
under
thick
trees
we
met
other
red
and
blue
and
green
lamped
diligences
starting
on
their
long
journey
just
as
ours
was
coming
to
an
end
then
i
knew
because
i
was
a
little
boy
and
heard
my
father
exclaim
here
paris
at
last
that
we
had
entered
the
capital
of
france
a
fact
that
impressed
me
very
much
so
much
it
seems
that
i
went
to
sleep
for
hours
at
a
stretch
and
woke
up
to
find
myself
in
the
garden
i
have
mentioned
and
to
retain
possession
of
that
self
without
break
or
solution
of
continuity
except
when
i
went
to
sleep
again
until
now
the
happiest
day
in
all
my
outer
life
for
in
an
old
shed
full
of
tools
and
lumber
at
the
end
of
the
garden
and
between
an
empty
and
a
disused
stable
each
an
eden
in
itself
i
found
a
small
quite
the
most
extraordinary
the
most
unheard
of
and
undreamed
of
humorously
daintily
exquisitely
fascinating
object
i
had
ever
come
across
in
all
my
brief
existence
i
spent
hours
enchanted
hours
in
wheeling
from
the
stable
to
the
and
more
enchanted
hours
in
wheeling
them
all
back
again
while
genial
french
workmen
who
were
busy
in
and
out
of
the
house
where
we
were
to
live
stopped
every
now
and
then
to
ask
questions
of
the
anglais
and
commend
his
knowledge
of
their
tongue
and
his
remarkable
skill
in
the
management
of
a
wheelbarrow
well
i
remember
wondering
with
at
the
intensity
the
poignancy
the
extremity
of
my
bliss
and
looking
forward
with
happy
confidence
to
an
endless
succession
of
such
hours
in
the
future
but
next
morning
though
the
weather
was
as
fine
and
the
wheelbarrow
and
the
and
the
genial
workmen
were
there
and
all
the
scents
and
sights
and
sounds
were
the
same
the
first
fine
careless
rapture
was
not
to
be
caught
again
and
the
glory
and
the
freshness
had
departed
thus
did
i
on
the
very
dawning
of
life
reach
at
a
single
tide
the
of
my
earthly
bliss
never
to
be
reached
again
by
me
on
this
side
of
the
ivory
gate
and
discover
that
to
make
the
perfection
of
human
happiness
endure
there
must
be
something
more
than
a
sweet
french
garden
a
small
french
wheelbarrow
and
a
nice
little
english
boy
who
spoke
french
and
had
the
love
of
approbation
a
fourth
dimension
is
required
i
found
it
in
due
time
but
if
there
were
no
more
enchanted
hours
like
the
first
there
were
to
be
seven
happy
years
that
have
the
quality
of
enchantment
as
i
look
back
on
them
oh
the
beautiful
garden
roses
nasturtiums
and
convolvulus
wallflowers
and
carnations
marigolds
and
sunflowers
dahlias
and
pansies
and
hollyhocks
and
poppies
and
heaven
knows
what
besides
in
my
fond
recollection
they
all
bloom
at
once
irrespective
of
time
and
season
to
see
and
smell
and
pick
all
these
for
the
first
time
at
the
susceptible
age
of
five
to
inherit
such
a
kingdom
after
five
years
of
gower
street
and
bedford
square
for
all
things
are
relative
and
everything
depends
upon
the
point
of
view
to
the
owner
of
chatsworth
and
to
his
gardeners
my
beautiful
french
garden
would
have
seemed
a
small
affair
illustration
le
anglais
and
what
a
world
of
insects
chatsworth
could
not
beat
indeed
is
no
doubt
sadly
lacking
in
them
beautiful
interesting
comic
grotesque
and
terrible
from
the
proud
to
the
earwig
and
his
cousin
the
devil
and
all
those
rampant
many
footed
things
that
pullulate
in
damp
and
darkness
under
big
flat
stones
to
think
that
i
have
been
friends
with
all
these
roses
and
centipedes
and
all
and
then
to
think
that
most
of
my
outer
life
has
been
spent
between
bare
whitewashed
walls
with
never
even
a
flea
or
a
spider
to
be
friends
with
again
our
house
where
i
had
been
born
five
years
before
an
old
yellow
house
with
green
shutters
and
of
slate
stood
between
this
garden
and
the
street
a
long
winding
street
roughly
flagged
with
suspended
across
at
long
intervals
these
lamps
were
let
down
with
pulleys
at
dusk
replenished
and
lit
and
then
hauled
up
again
to
make
darkness
visible
for
a
few
hours
on
nights
when
the
moon
was
away
opposite
to
us
was
a
boys
school
maison
dirigée
par
jules
saindou
bachelier
et
maître
ès
lettres
et
ès
sciences
and
author
of
a
treatise
on
geology
with
such
hauntingly
terrific
pictures
of
antediluvian
reptiles
battling
in
the
primeval
slime
that
i
have
never
been
able
to
forget
them
my
father
who
was
fond
of
science
made
me
a
present
of
it
on
my
sixth
birthday
it
cost
me
many
a
nightmare
from
our
windows
we
could
see
and
hear
the
boys
at
play
at
a
proper
distance
french
boys
sound
just
like
english
ones
though
they
do
not
look
so
on
account
of
their
blue
blouses
and
dusky
cropped
heads
and
we
could
see
the
gymnastic
fixtures
in
the
pride
le
portique
la
poutre
le
cheval
et
les
barres
parallèles
thus
they
were
described
in
saindou
prospectus
on
either
side
of
the
street
which
was
called
the
street
of
the
pump
as
far
as
eye
could
reach
looking
west
were
just
like
our
own
only
agreeably
different
and
garden
walls
overtopped
with
the
foliage
of
sycamore
acacia
and
lime
and
here
and
there
huge
portals
and
iron
gates
defended
by
posts
of
stone
gave
ingress
to
mysterious
abodes
of
brick
and
plaster
and
granite
and
embosomed
in
greenery
looking
east
one
could
see
in
the
near
distance
unsophisticated
shops
with
windows
of
many
panes
liard
the
grocer
corbin
the
poulterer
the
butcher
the
baker
the
and
this
delightful
street
as
it
went
on
its
winding
way
led
not
to
bedford
square
or
the
new
university
college
hospital
but
to
paris
through
the
arc
de
triomphe
at
one
end
and
to
the
river
seine
at
the
other
or
else
turning
to
the
right
to
st
cloud
through
the
bois
de
boulogne
of
louis
philippe
premier
roi
des
français
as
different
from
the
paris
and
the
bois
de
boulogne
of
as
a
diligence
from
an
express
train
on
one
side
of
the
beautiful
garden
was
another
beautiful
garden
separated
from
ours
by
a
high
wall
covered
with
peach
and
pear
and
plum
and
apricot
trees
on
the
other
accessible
to
us
through
a
small
door
in
another
lower
wall
clothed
with
jasmine
clematis
convolvulus
and
nasturtium
was
a
long
straight
avenue
of
acacia
laburnum
lilac
and
may
so
closely
planted
that
the
walls
on
either
side
could
scarcely
be
seen
what
lovely
patches
they
made
on
the
ground
when
the
sun
shone
one
end
of
this
abutted
on
the
street
of
the
pump
from
which
it
was
fenced
by
tall
iron
gates
between
stone
portals
and
at
the
side
was
a
porte
bâtarde
guarded
by
le
père
et
la
mère
françois
the
old
concierge
and
his
old
wife
peace
to
their
ashes
and
heaven
rest
their
kindly
genial
souls
the
other
end
of
the
avenue
where
there
was
also
an
iron
gate
admitted
to
a
large
private
park
that
seemed
to
belong
to
nobody
and
of
which
we
were
free
a
very
wilderness
of
delight
a
heaven
a
terror
of
tangled
thickets
and
not
too
dangerous
chalk
cliffs
disused
old
quarries
and
dark
caverns
prairies
of
lush
grass
sedgy
pools
turnip
fields
forests
of
pine
groves
and
avenues
of
dank
valleys
of
and
hawthorn
which
summer
made
dark
at
noon
bare
mountainous
regions
whence
one
could
reconnoitre
afar
all
sorts
of
wild
and
fearsome
places
for
savages
and
wild
beasts
to
hide
and
small
boys
to
roam
quite
safely
in
quest
of
perilous
adventure
all
this
vast
enclosure
full
of
strange
singing
humming
whistling
buzzing
twittering
cooing
booming
croaking
flying
creeping
crawling
jumping
climbing
burrowing
splashing
diving
things
had
been
neglected
for
ages
an
eden
where
one
might
gather
and
eat
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
without
fear
and
learn
lovingly
the
ways
of
life
without
losing
one
innocence
a
forest
that
had
remade
for
itself
a
new
virginity
and
become
primeval
once
more
where
beautiful
nature
had
reasserted
her
own
sweet
will
and
massed
and
tangled
everything
together
as
though
a
beauty
had
been
sleeping
there
undisturbed
for
close
on
a
hundred
years
and
was
only
waiting
for
the
charming
prince
or
as
it
turned
out
a
few
years
later
alas
the
speculative
builder
and
the
railway
engineer
those
princes
of
our
day
my
fond
remembrance
would
tell
me
that
this
region
was
almost
boundless
well
as
i
remember
its
boundaries
my
knowledge
of
physical
geography
as
applied
to
this
particular
suburb
of
paris
bids
me
assign
more
modest
limits
to
this
earthly
paradise
which
again
was
separated
by
an
easily
surmounted
fence
from
louis
philippe
bois
de
boulogne
and
to
this
i
can
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
assign
any
limits
whatever
except
the
pretty
old
town
from
which
it
takes
its
name
and
whose
principal
street
leads
to
that
magical
combination
of
river
bridge
palace
gardens
mountain
and
forest
st
cloud
what
more
could
be
wanted
for
a
small
boy
fresh
if
such
be
freshness
from
the
very
heart
of
bloomsbury
that
not
a
single
drop
should
be
lacking
to
the
full
cup
of
that
small
boy
felicity
there
was
a
pond
on
the
way
from
passy
to
st
cloud
a
memorable
pond
called
la
mare
the
sole
aquatic
treasure
that
louis
philippe
bois
de
boulogne
could
boast
for
in
those
ingenuous
days
there
existed
no
artificial
lake
fed
by
an
artificial
stream
no
no
jardin
the
wood
was
just
a
wood
and
nothing
more
a
dense
wild
wood
that
covered
many
hundreds
of
acres
and
sheltered
many
thousands
of
wild
live
things
though
mysteriously
deep
in
the
middle
this
famous
pond
which
may
have
been
centuries
old
and
still
exists
was
not
large
you
might
almost
fling
a
stone
across
it
anywhere
illustration
bounded
on
three
sides
by
the
forest
now
shorn
away
it
was
just
hidden
from
the
dusty
road
by
a
fringe
of
trees
and
one
could
have
it
all
to
one
self
except
on
sunday
and
thursday
afternoons
when
a
few
parisians
remembered
its
existence
and
in
its
loveliness
forgot
their
own
to
be
there
at
all
was
to
be
happy
for
not
only
was
it
quite
the
most
secluded
picturesque
and
beautiful
pond
in
all
the
habitable
globe
that
pond
of
ponds
the
pond
but
it
teemed
with
a
far
greater
number
and
variety
of
wonderful
insects
and
reptiles
than
any
other
pond
in
the
world
such
at
least
i
believed
must
be
the
case
for
they
were
endless
to
watch
these
creatures
to
learn
their
ways
to
catch
them
which
we
sometimes
did
to
take
them
home
and
be
kind
to
them
and
try
to
tame
them
and
teach
them
our
ways
with
never
varying
it
is
true
but
in
oh
such
jolly
company
became
a
hobby
that
lasted
me
on
and
off
for
seven
years
la
mare
the
very
name
has
a
magic
from
all
the
associations
that
gathered
round
it
during
that
time
to
cling
forever
how
i
loved
it
at
night
snoozing
in
my
warm
bed
i
would
awesomely
think
of
it
and
how
solemn
it
looked
when
i
had
reluctantly
left
it
at
dusk
an
hour
or
two
before
then
i
would
picture
it
to
myself
later
lying
deep
and
cold
and
still
under
the
stars
in
the
dark
thicket
with
all
that
weird
uncanny
lite
seething
beneath
its
stagnant
surface
then
gradually
the
water
would
sink
and
the
reeds
left
naked
begin
to
move
and
rustle
ominously
and
from
among
their
roots
in
the
uncovered
slush
everything
alive
would
make
for
the
middle
hopping
gliding
writhing
frantically
down
shrank
the
water
and
soon
in
the
slimy
bottom
yards
below
huge
fat
salamanders
and
forgotten
tadpoles
as
large
as
rats
gigantic
toads
enormous
flat
beetles
all
kinds
of
hairy
scaly
spiny
bulbous
shapeless
monsters
without
name
offspring
of
the
mire
that
had
been
sleeping
there
for
hundreds
of
years
woke
up
and
crawled
in
and
out
and
wallowed
and
interwriggled
and
devoured
each
other
like
the
great
saurians
and
batrachians
in
my

then
would
i
wake
up
with
a
start
in
a
cold
perspiration
an
icy
chill
shooting
through
me
that
roughed
my
skin
and
stirred
the
roots
of
my
hair
and
ardently
wish
for
morning
in
and
far
away
among
the
cold
fogs
of
clerkenwell
when
the
frequent
longing
would
come
over
me
to
revisit
the
pretty
place
of
my
birth
it
was
for
the
mare
i
longed
the
most
was
the
loadstar
the
very
pole
of
my
desires
always
thither
the
wings
of
my
hopeless
fancy
bore
me
first
of
all
it
was
oh
to
tread
that
sunlit
grassy
brink
once
more
and
to
watch
the
merry
tadpoles
swarm
and
the
green
frog
takes
its
header
like
a
little
man
and
the
swim
to
his
hole
among
the
roots
of
the
willow
and
the
thread
his
undulating
way
between
the
stems
and
to
dream
fondly
of
the
delightful
irrevocable
past
on
the
very
spot
of
all
where
i
and
mine
were
always
happiest

the
avenue

have

the
way
up
a

by
one
madame
pelé
and
there
among
others
came
to
board
and
lodge
a
short
while
after
our
advent
four
or
five
gentlemen
who
had
tried
to
invade
france
with
a
certain
grim
pretender
at
their
head
and
a
tame
eagle
as
a
symbol
of
empire
to
rally
round
the
expedition
had
failed
the
pretender
had
been
consigned
to
a
fortress
the
eagle
had
found
a
home
in
the
public
of
which
it
adorned
for
many
years
and
where
it
fed
as
it
had
never
probably
fed
before
and
these
the
faithful
followers
le

le
major
duquesnois
le
capitaine
audenis
le
docteur
lombal
and
one
or
two
others
whose
names
i
have
forgotten
were
prisoners
on

at
madame

and
did
not
seem
to
find
their
durance

them

villa

a
grecian
portico

were
inscribed

words

it
was
not
tenanted

two

three
years
after
our
arrival
in
the
genial
french
fashion

those
times
we
soon
got
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
these
and
other
neighbors

saw
much
of
each
other

all
times

the
day
my
tall
and
beautiful
young
mother
la

she
was
gallantly
called

an
englishwoman

had
been
born

my
gay
and
jovial
father

an

had
been
born

up

a
phenomenal
voice
a
barytone

tenor
rolled
into
one
a
marvel
of
richness
sweetness
flexibility

power

had
intended
to
sing
at
the
opera
indeed
he
had
studied
for
three
years
at
the
paris
conservatoire
to
that
end
and
there
he
had
carried
all
before
him
and
given
rise
to
the
highest
hopes

his

who
were
catholics
of
the
blackest
and
legitimists
of
the
whitest
dye
and
as
poor
as
church
rats
had
objected
to
such

of
wealth
and
fame
however
he
had
just
enough
to
live
upon
and
had
married
a
wife
a
heretic
who
had
just
about
as
much
or
as
little
and
he
spent
his
time
and
both
his
money
and
hers
in
scientific
inventions
to
little
purpose
for
well
as
he
had
learned
how
to
sing
he
had
not
been
to
any
conservatoire
where
they
teach
one
how
to
invent
so
that
as
he
waited
for
his
ship
to
come
home
he
sang
only
to
amuse
his
wife
as
they
say
the
nightingale
does
and
to
ease
himself
of
superfluous
energy
and
to
charm
the
servants
and
le
père
et
la
mère
françois
and
the
five
followers
of
napoleon
and
all
and
everybody
who
cared
to
listen
and
last
and
least
and
most
myself
for
this
great
neglected
gift
of
his
on
which
he
set
so
little
store
was
already
to
me
the
most
beautiful
and
mysterious
thing
in
the
world
and
next
to
this
my
mother
sweet
playing
on
the
harp
and
piano
for
she
was
an
admirable
musician
it
was
her
custom
to
play
at
night
leaving
the
door
of
my
bedroom
ajar
and
also
the
door
so
that
i
could
hear
her
till
i
fell
asleep
sometimes
when
my
father
was
at
home
the
spirit
would
move
him
to
hum
or
sing
the
airs
she
played
as
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
on
the
track
of
a
new
invention
and
though
he
sang
and
hummed
the
sweet
searching
manly
tones
seemed
to
fill
all
space
the
hushed
house
became
a
the
harp
a
mere
subservient
tinkle
and
my
small
excitable
frame
would
thrill
and
vibrate
under
the
waves
of
my
unconscious
father
voice
and
oh
the
charming
airs
he
sang
his
stock
was
inexhaustible
and
so
was
hers
and
thus
an
endless
succession
of
lovely
melodies
went
ringing
through
that
happy
period
and
just
as
when
a
man
is
drowning
or
falling
from
a
height
his
whole
past
life
is
said
to
be
mapped
out
before
his
mental
vision
as
in
a
single
flash
so
seven
years
of
sweet
priceless
home
love
seven
times
four
changing
seasons
of
simple
genial
frenchness
an
ideal
house
with
all
its
pretty
furniture
and
shape
and
color
a
garden
full
of
trees
and
flowers
a
large
park
and
all
the
wild
live
things
therein
a
town
and
its
inhabitants
a
mile
or
two
of
historic
river
a
wood
big
enough
to
reach
from
the
arc
de
triomphe
to
st
cloud
and
in
it
the
pond
of
ponds
and
every
wind
and
weather
that
the
changing
seasons
can
bring
all
lie
embedded
and
embalmed
for
me
in
every
single
bar
of
at
least
a
hundred
different
tunes
to
be
evoked
at
will
for
the
small
trouble
and
cost
of
just
whistling
or
humming
the
same
or
even
playing
it
with
one
finger
on
the
piano
when
i
had
a
piano
within
reach
enough
to
last
me
for
a
lifetime
with
proper
economy
of
course
it
will
not
do
to
exhaust
by
too
frequent
experiment
the
strange
capacity
of
a
melodic
bar
for
preserving
the
essence
of
things
and
days
that
are
no
more
oh
nightingale
whether
thou
singest
thyself
or
better
still
if
thy
voice
by
not
in
thy
throat
but
in
thy
fiery
heart
and
subtle
brain
and
thou
makest
songs
for
the
singing
of
many
others
blessed
be
thy
name
the
very
sound
of
it
is
sweet
in
every
clime
and
tongue
nightingale
rossignol
usignuolo
bulbul
even
nachtigall
does
not
sound
amiss
in
the
mouth
of
a
fair
english
girl
who
has
had
a
hanoverian
for
a
governess
and
indeed
it
is
in
the
nachtigall
country
that
the
best
music
is
made
illustration
oh
nightingale
and
oh
nightingale
never
never
grudge
thy
song
to
those
who
love
it
nor
waste
it
upon
those
who
do
not
thus
serenaded
i
would
close
my
eyes
and
lapped
in
darkness
and
warmth
and
heavenly
sound
be
lulled
asleep
perchance
to
dream
for
my
early
childhood
was
often
haunted
by
a
dream
which
at
first
i
took
for
a
reality
a
transcendant
dream
of
some
interest
and
importance
to
mankind
as
the
patient
reader
will
admit
in
time
but
many
years
of
my
life
passed
away
before
i
was
able
to
explain
and
account
for
it
i
had
but
to
turn
my
face
to
the
wall
and
soon
i
found
myself
in
company
with
a
lady
who
had
white
hair
and
a
young
face
a
very
beautiful
young
face
sometimes
i
walked
with
her
hand
in
hand
i
being
quite
a
small
child
and
together
we
fed
innumerable
pigeons
who
lived
in
a
tower
by
a
winding
stream
that
ended
in
a
it
was
too
lovely
and
i
would
wake
sometimes
we
went
into
a
dark
place
where
there
was
a
fiery
furnace
with
many
holes
and
many
people
working
and
moving
about
among
them
a
man
with
white
hair
and
a
young
face
like
the
lady
and
beautiful
red
heels
to
his
shoes
and
under
his
guidance
i
would
contrive
to
make
in
the
furnace
a
charming
little
cocked
hat
of
colored
glass
a
treasure
and
the
sheer
joy
thereof
would
wake
me
sometimes
the
lady
and
i
would
sit
together
at
a
square
box
from
which
she
made
lovely
music
and
she
would
sing
my
favorite
song
a
song
that
i
adored
but
i
always
woke
before
this
song
came
to
an
end
on
account
of
the
too
insupportably
intense
bliss
i
felt
on
hearing
it
and
all
i
could
remember
when
awake
were
the
words
triste
comment
sale
the
air
which
i
knew
so
well
in
my
dream
i
could
not
recall
it
seemed
as
though
some
innermost
core
of
my
being
some
childish
holy
of
holies
secreted
a
source
of
supersubtle
reminiscence
which
under
some
stimulus
that
now
and
again
became
active
during
sleep
exhaled
itself
in
this
singular
dream
shadowy
and
slight
but
invariably
accompanied
by
a
sense
of
felicity
so
measureless
and
so
penetrating
that
i
would
always
wake
in
a
mystic
flutter
of
ecstasy
the
bare
remembrance
of
which
was
enough
to
bless
and
make
happy
many
a
succeeding
hour
besides
this
happy
family
of
three
close
by
in
the
street
of
the
tower
lived
my
grandmother
biddulph
and
my
aunt
plunket
a
widow
with
her
two
sons
alfred
and
charlie
and
her
daughter
madge
they
also
were
fair
to
look
at
extremely
so
of
the
type
with
frank
open
jolly
manners
and
no
beastly
british
pride
so
that
physically
at
least
we
reflected
much
credit
on
the
english
name
which
was
not
in
good
odor
just
then
at
where
waterloo
was
unforgotten
in
time
however
our
nationality
was
condoned
on
account
of
our
good
looks
non
angli
sed
angeli
as
saindou
was
gallantly
pleased
to
exclaim
when
he
called
with
a
prospectus
of
his
school
and
found
us
all
gathered
together
under
the
big
on
our
lawn
but
english
beauty
in
passy
was
soon
to
receive
a
memorable
addition
to
its
ranks
in
the
person
of
a
certain
madame
seraskier
who
came
with
an
invalid
little
daughter
to
live
in
the
house
so
modestly
described
in
gold
as
parva
sed
apta
she
was
the
english
or
rather
the
irish
wife
of
a
hungarian
patriot
and
man
of
science
seraskier
son
of
the
famous
violinist
an
extremely
tall
thin
man
almost
gigantic
with
a
grave
benevolent
face
and
a
head
like
a
prophet
who
was
like
my
father
very
much
away
from
his
family
conspiring
perhaps
or
perhaps
only
inventing
like
my
father
and
looking
out
for
his
ship
to
come
home
illustration
she
topped
my
tall
mother
this
fair
lady
advent
was
a
sensation
to
me
a
sensation
that
never
palled
or
wore
itself
away
it
was
no
longer
now
la
belle
madame
pasquier
but
la
divine
madame
seraskier
as
the
french
are
apt
to
be
she
topped
my
tall
mother
by
more
than
half
a
head
as
was
remarked
by
madame
pelé
whose
similes
were
all
of
the
kitchen
and
elle
lui
mangerait
des
petits
pâtés
sur
la
tête
and
height
that
lends
dignity
to
ugliness
magnifies
beauty
on
a
scale
of
geometrical
progression
for
every
consecutive
inch
between
five
feet
five
let
us
say
and
five
feet
ten
or
eleven
or
thereabouts
which
i
take
to
have
been
madame
seraskier
measurement
she
had
black
hair
and
blue
eyes
of
the
kind
that
turns
violet
in
a
novel
and
a
beautiful
white
skin
lovely
hands
and
feet
a
perfect
figure
and
features
chiselled
and
finished
and
polished
and
turned
out
with
such
singular
felicitousness
that
one
gazed
and
gazed
till
the
heart
was
full
of
a
strange
jealous
resentment
at
any
one
else
having
the
right
to
gaze
on
something
so
rare
so
divinely
so
sacredly
fair
any
one
in
the
world
but
one
self
but
a
woman
can
be
all
this
without
being
madame
seraskier
she
was
much
more
for
the
warmth
and
genial
kindness
of
her
nature
shone
through
her
eyes
and
rang
in
her
voice
all
was
of
a
piece
with
her
her
simplicity
her
grace
her
naturalness
and
absence
of
vanity
her
courtesy
her
sympathy
her
mirthfulness
i
do
not
know
which
was
the
most
irresistible
she
had
a
slight
irish
accent
when
she
spoke
english
a
less
slight
english
accent
when
she
spoke
french
i
made
it
my
business
to
acquire
both
indeed
she
was
in
heart
and
mind
and
body
what
we
should
be
but
for
the
lack
of
a
little
public
spirit
and
under
proper
guidance
during
the
last
few
hundred
years
on
the
part
of
a
few
thousand
millions
of
our
improvident
there
should
be
no
available
ugly
frames
for
beautiful
souls
to
be
hurried
into
by
carelessness
or
mistake
and
no
ugly
souls
should
be
suffered
to
creep
like
into
beautiful
shells
never
intended
for
them
the
outward
and
visible
form
should
mark
the
inward
and
spiritual
grace
that
it
seldom
does
so
is
a
fact
there
is
no
gainsaying
alas
such
beauty
is
such
an
exception
that
its
possessor
like
a
prince
of
the
blood
royal
is
pampered
and
spoiled
from
the
very
cradle
and
every
good
and
generous
and
unselfish
impulse
is
corroded
by
adulation
that
spontaneous
tribute
so
lightly
won
so
quickly
paid
and
accepted
so
royally
as
a
due
so
that
only
when
by
heaven
grace
the
very
beautiful
are
also
very
good
is
it
time
for
us
to
go
down
on
our
knees
and
say
our
prayers
in
thankfulness
and
adoration
for
the
divine
has
been
permitted
to
make
itself
manifest
for
a
while
in
the
perishable
likeness
of
our
poor
humanity
a
beautiful
face
a
beautiful
tune
earth
holds
nothing
to
beat
these
and
of
such
for
want
of
better
materials
we
have
built
for
ourselves
the
kingdom
of
heaven
plus

et
peut
davantage
un
beau

et

meilleur
que

jadis

my
mother
soon
became
the
passionately
devoted
friend
of
the
divine
madame
seraskier
and
i
what
would
i
not
have
done
what
danger
would
i
not
have
faced
what
death
would
i
not
have
died
for
her
i
did
not
die
i
lived
her
protestant
to
be
for
nearly
fifty
years
for
nearly
fifty
years
to
recollect
the
rapture
and
the
pain
it
was
to
look
at
her
that
inexplicable
longing
ache
that
dumb
delicious
complex
innocent
distress
for
which
none
but
the
greatest
poets
have
ever
found
expression
and
which
perhaps
they
have
not
felt
half
so
acutely
these
glib
and
gifted
ones
as
did
at
the
susceptible
age
of
seven
eight
nine
ten
eleven
and
twelve
she
had
other
slaves
of
my
sex
the
five
napoleonic
heroes
did
homage
each
after
his
fashion
the
good
major
with
a
kind
of
sweet
fatherly
tenderness
touching
to
behold
the
others
with
perhaps
less
unselfish
adoration
notably
the
brave
capitaine
audenis
of
the
fair
waxed
mustache
and
beautiful
brown
tail
coat
so
tightly
buttoned
with
gilt
buttons
across
his
enormous
chest
and
imperceptible
little
feet
so
tightly
imprisoned
in
shiny
tipped
female
cloth
boots
with
buttons
of
whose
hobby
was
i
believe
to
try
and
compensate
himself
for
the
misfortunes
of
war
by
more
successful
attempts
in
another
direction
anyhow
he
betrayed
a
warmth
that
made
my
small
bosom
a
gehenna
until
she
laughed
and
snubbed
him
into
due
propriety
and
shamefaced
it
soon
became
evident
that
she
favored
two
at
least
out
of
all
this
little
masculine
world
the
major
myself
and
a
strange
trio
we
made
her
poor
little
daughter
the
object
of
her
passionate
solicitude
a
very
clever
and
precocious
child
was
the
reverse
of
beautiful
although
she
would
have
had
fine
eyes
but
for
her
red
lashless
lids
she
wore
her
thick
hair
cropped
short
like
a
boy
and
was
pasty
and
sallow
in
complexion
and
overgrown
with
long
thin
hands
and
feet
and
arms
and
legs
of
quite
pathetic
length
and
tenuity
a
silent
and
melancholy
little
girl
who
sucked
her
thumb
perpetually
and
kept
her
own
counsel
she
would
have
to
lie
in
bed
for
days
together
and
when
she
got
well
enough
to
sit
up
i
to
please
her
mother
would
read
to
her
robinson
and
at
contes
de
madame
the
shipwreck
from
don
juan
of
which
we
never
tired
and
the
giaour
the
corsair
and
mazeppa
and
last
but
not
least
parleys
natural
which
we
got
to
know
by
heart
and
out
of
this
latter
volume
i
would
often
declaim
for
her
benefit
what
has
always
been
to
me
the
most
beautiful
poem
in
the
world
possibly
because
it
was
the
first
i
read
for
myself
or
else
because
it
is
so
intimately
associated
with
those
happy
days
under
an
engraving
of
a
wild
duck
after
bewick
i
believe
were
quoted
bryant
lines
to
a
they
charmed
me
then
and
charm
me
now
as
nothing
else
has
quite
charmed
me
i
become
a
child
again
as
i
think
of
them
with
a
child
virgin
subtlety
of
perception
and
magical
susceptibility
to
vague
suggestions
of
the
infinite
poor
little
mimsey
seraskier
would
listen
with
distended
eyes
and
quick
comprehension
she
had
a
strange
fancy
that
a
pair
of
invisible
beings
la
fée
tarapatapoum
and
le
prince
charmant
two
favorite
characters
of
le
major
were
always
in
attendance
upon
us
upon
her
and
me
and
were
equally
fond
of
us
both
that
is
la
fée
tarapatapoum
of
me
and
le
prince
charmant
of
her
and
watched
over
us
and
would
protect
us
through
life
o
ils
sont
joliment
bien
ensemble
tous
les
deux
ils
sont
inséparables
she
would
often
exclaim
of
these
visionary
beings
and
of
the
she
would
say
il
aime
beaucoup
cet
le
prince
charmant
dis
encore
quand
il
vole
si
haut
et
fait
froid
et
est
fatigué
et
que
la
nuit
vient
mais
ne
veut
pas
descendre
and
i
would
day
thy
wings
have
fanned
at
that
far
height
the
cold
thin
atmosphere
yet
stoop
not
weary
to
the
welcome
land
though
the
dark
night
be
near
and
poor
morbid
precocious
overwrought
mimsey
eyes
would
fill
and
she
would
meditatively
suck
her
thumb
and
think
unutterable
things
and
then
i
would
copy
bewick
for
her
as
she
sat
on
the
arm
of
my
chair
and
patiently
watched
and
she
would
say
la
fée
tarapatapoum
trouve
que
tu
dessines
dans
la
perfection
and
treasure
up
these
little
masterpieces
pour
de
la
fée
tarapatapoum
illustration
there
was
one
drawing
she
prized
above
all
others
a
steel
engraving
in
a
volume
of
byron
which
represented
two
beautiful
beings
of
either
sex
walking
hand
in
hand
through
a
dark
cavern
the
man
was
in
garb
the
lady
who
went
barefoot
and
lightly
clad
held
a
torch
and
underneath
was
written
and
neuha
led
her
torquil
by
the
hand
and
waved
along
the
vaults
her
flaming
brand
i
spent
hours
in
copying
it
for
her
and
she
preferred
the
copy
to
the
original
and
would
have
it
that
the
two
figures
were
excellent
portraits
of
her
prince
and
fairy
sometimes
during
these
readings
and
sketchings
under
the
on
the
lawn
the
sleeping
médor
a
huge
nondescript
sort
of
dog
built
up
of
every
breed
in
france
with
the
virtues
of
all
and
the
vices
of
none
would
wag
his
three
inches
of
tail
and
utter
soft
whimperings
of
welcome
in
his
dream
and
she
would
say
le
prince
charmant
qui
lui
dit
donne
la
patte
or
our
old
tomcat
would
rise
from
his
slumbers
with
his
tail
up
and
rub
an
imaginary
skirt
and
it
was

we
mostly
spoke
french
in
spite
of
strict
injunctions
to
the
contrary
from
our
fathers
and
mothers
who
were
much
concerned
lest
we
should
forget
our
english
altogether
in
time
we
made
a
kind
of
ingenious
compromise
for
mimsey
who
was
full
of
resource
invented
a
new
language
or
rather
two
which
we
called
frankingle
and
inglefrank
respectively
they
consisted
in
anglicizing
french
nouns
and
verbs
and
then
conjugating
and
pronouncing
them
englishly
or
for
instance
it
was
very
cold
and
the
window
was
open
so
she
would
say
in
frankingle
dispeach
yourself
to
ferm

feneeter

which
was
inglefrank
with
this
contrivance
we
managed
to
puzzle
and
mystify
the
uninitiated
english
and
french
alike
the
intelligent
reader
who
sees
it
all
in
print
will
not
be
so
easily
taken
in
when
mimsey
was
well
enough
she
would
come
with
my
cousins
and
me
into
the
park
where
we
always
had
a
good
time
lying
in
ambush
for
red
indians
rescuing
madge
plunket
from
a
caitiff
knight
or
else
hunting
snakes
and
and
lizards
and
digging
for
lizard
eggs
which
we
would
hatch
at
home
that
happy
refuge
for
all
manner
of
beasts
as
well
as
little
boys
and
girls
for
there
were
squirrels
hedgehogs
and
an
owl
a
raven
a
monkey
and
white
mice
little
birds
that
had
strayed
from
the
maternal
nest
before
they
could
fly
they
always
died
the
dog
médor
and
any
other
dog
who
chose
not
to
mention
a
gigantic
made
out
of
a
real
stuffed
pony
the
smallest
pony
that
had
ever
been
often
our
united
high
spirits
were
too
boisterous
for
mimsey
dreadful
headaches
would
come
on
and
she
would
sit
in
a
corner
nursing
a
hedgehog
with
one
arm
and
holding
her
thumb
in
her
mouth
with
the
other
only
when
we
were
alone
together
was
she
happy
and
then
tristement
on
summer
evenings
whole
parties
of
us
and
small
would
walk
through
the
park
and
the
bois
de
boulogne
to
the
mare
as
we
got
near
enough
for
médor
to
scent
the
water
he
would
bark
and
grin
and
gyrate
and
go
mad
with
excitement
for
he
had
the
gift
of
diving
after
stones
and
liked
to
show
it
off
there
we
would
catch
huge
yellow
underneath
newts
green
frogs
with
beautiful
spots
and
a
splendid
parabolic
leap
gold
and
silver
fish
pied
with
purply
brown
i
mention
them
in
the
order
of
their
attractiveness
the
fish
were
too
tame
and
easily
caught
and
their
beauty
of
too
civilized
an
order
the
rare
flat
vicious
dytiscus
took
the
cake
sometimes
even
we
would
walk
through
boulogne
to
st
cloud
to
see
the
new
railway
and
the
trains
an
inexhaustible
subject
of
wonder
and
delight
and
eat
ices
at
the
tête
noire
a
hotel
which
had
been
the
scene
of
a
terrible
murder
that
led
to
a
cause
célèbre
and
we
would
come
back
through
the
scented
night
while
the
glowworms
were
shining
in
the
grass
and
the
distant
frogs
were
croaking
in
the
mare
now
and
then
a
startled
roebuck
would
gallop
in
short
bounds
across
the
path
from
thicket
to
thicket
and
médor
would
go
mad
again
and
wake
the
echoes
of
the
new
paris
fortification
which
were
still
in
the
course
of
construction
illustration
he
had
not
the
gift
of
catching
roebucks
if
my
father
were
of
the
party
he
would
yodel
tyrolese
melodies
and
sing
lovely
songs
of
boieldieu
hérold
and
grétry
or
drink
to
me
only
with
thine
eyes
or
else
the
bay
of
dublin
for
madame
seraskier
who
had
the
nostalgia
of
her
beloved
country
whenever
her
beloved
husband
was
away
or
else
we
would
break
out
into
a
jolly
chorus
and
march
to
the
tune

which
would
give
us
all
the
nostalgia
of
supper
or
else
again
if
it
were
too
hot
to
sing
or
we
were
too
tired
le
major
forsaking
the
realms
of
and
uncovering
his
high
bald
head
as
he
walked
would
gravely
and
reverently
tell
us
of
his
great
master
of
brienne
of
marengo
and
austerlitz
of
the
farewells
at
fontainebleau
and
the
hundred
days
never
of
helena
he
would
not
trust
himself
to
speak
to
us
of
that
and
gradually
working
his
way
to
waterloo
he
would
put
his
hat
on
and
demonstrate
to
us
by
how
virtually
the
english
had
lost
the
day
and
why
and
wherefore
and
on
all
the
little
party
a
solemn
stillness
would
fall
as
we
listened
and
on
some
of
us
the
sweet
nostalgia
of
bed
oh
the
good
old
time
the
night
was
consecrated
for
me
by
the
gleam
and
scent
and
rustle
of
madame
seraskier
gown
as
i
walked
by
her
side
in
the
deepening
dusk
a
gleam
of
yellow
or
pale
blue
or
white
a
scent
of
sandalwood
a
rustle
that
told
of
a
light
vigorous
tread
on
firm
narrow
feet
that
were
not
easily
tired
of
an
anxious
motherly
wish
to
get
back
to
mimsey
who
was
not
strong
enough
for
these
longer
expeditions
on
the
shorter
ones
i
used
sometimes
to
carry
mimsey
on
my
back
most
of
the
way
home
to
please
her
mother
a
frail
burden
with
her
poor
long
thin
arms
round
my
neck
and
her
pale
cold
cheek
against
my
ear
she
weighed
nothing
and
when
i
was
tired
le
major
would
relieve
me
but
not
for
long
she
always
wanted
to
be
carried
by
gogo
for
so
i
was
called
for
no
reason
whatever
unless
it
was
that
my
name
was
peter
she
would
start
at
the
pale
birches
that
shone
out
against
the
gloom
and
shiver
if
a
bough
scraped
her
and
tell
me
all
about
the
mais
comme
ils
sont
là
tous
les
deux
meaning
the
prince
and
the
fairy
il
a
absolument
rien
à
craindre
and
mimsey
was
bonne
in
spite
of
her
solemnity
and
poor
health
and
many
pains
so
grateful
for
small
kindnesses
so
appreciative
of
small
talents
so
indulgent
to
small
vanities
of
which
she
seemed
to
have
no
more
share
than
her
mother
and
so
deeply
humorous
in
spite
of
her
eternal
gravity
for
she
was
a
real
tomboy
at
heart
that
i
soon
carried
her
not
only
to
please
her
mother
but
to
please
herself
and
would
have
done
anything
for
her
as
for
le
major
he
gradually
discovered
that
mimsey
was
half
a
martyr
and
half
a
saint
and
possessed
all
the
virtues
under
the
sun
ah
vous
ne
la
comprenez
pas
cette
enfant
vous
verrez
un
jour
quand
ça
ira
mieux
vous
verrez
elle
est
comme
sa
mère
elle
a
toutes
les
intelligences
de
la
tête
et
du
coeur
and
he
would
wish
it
had
pleased
heaven
that
he
should
be
her
grandfather
on
the
maternal
side
grandpère
this
old
soldier
had
learned
it
without
ever
having
had
either
a
son
or
a
daughter
of
his
own
he
was
a
grandfather
moreover
mimsey
and
i
had
many
tastes
and
passions
in
common
music
for
instance
as
well
as
bewick
and
byron
poetry
and
roast
chestnuts
and
domestic
pets
and
above
all
the
mare
which
she
preferred
in
the
autumn
when
the
brown
and
yellow
leaves
were
eddying
and
scampering
and
chasing
each
other
round
its
margin
or
drifting
on
its
troubled
surface
and
the
cold
wet
wind
piped
through
the
dishevelled
boughs
of
the
forest
under
the
leaden
sky
she
said
it
was
good
to
be
there
then
and
think
of
home
and
the
fireside
and
better
still
when
home
was
reached
at
last
to
think
of
the
desolate
pond
we
had
left
and
good
indeed
it
was
to
trudge
home
by
wood
and
park
and
avenue
at
dusk
when
the
bats
were
about
with
alfred
and
charlie
and
mimsey
and
madge
and
médor
swishing
our
way
through
the
lush
dead
leaves
scattering
the
beautiful
ripe
out
of
its
split
creamy
case
or
picking
up
acorns
and
beechnuts
here
and
there
as
we
went
and
once
home
it
was
good
very
good
to
think
how
dark
and
lonesome
and
shivery
it
must
be
out
there
by
the
as
we
squatted
and
chatted
and
roasted
chestnuts
by
the
wood
fire
in
the
before
the
candles
were
lit
chien
et
as
was
called
the
french
gloaming
while
thérèse
was
laying
the
and
telling
us
the
news
and
cutting
bread
and
butter
and
my
mother
played
the
harp
in
the
above
till
the
last
red
streak
died
out
of
the
wet
west
behind
the
swaying
and
the
curtains
were
drawn
and
there
was
light
and
the
appetites
were
let
loose
i
love
to
sit
here
in
my
solitude
and
captivity
and
recall
every
incident
of
that
sweet
epoch
to
ache
with
the
pangs
of
happy
remembrance
than
which
for
the
likes
of
me
great
poets
tell
us
there
is
no
greater
grief
this
sorrow
crown
of
sorrow
is
my
joy
and
my
consolation
and
ever
has
been
and
i
would
not
exchange
it
for
youth
health
wealth
honor
and
freedom
only
for
thrice
happy
childhood
itself
once
more
over
and
over
again
would
i
give
up
its
thrice
happy
recollections
that
it
should
not
be
all
beer
and
skittles
with
us
and
therefore
apt
to
pall
my
cousins
and
i
had
to
work
pretty
hard
in
the
first
place
my
dear
mother
did
all
she
could
to
make
me
an
infant
prodigy
of
learning
she
tried
to
teach
me
italian
which
she
spoke
as
fluently
as
english
or
french
for
she
had
lived
much
in
italy
and
i
had
to
translate
the
gierusalemme
liberata
into
both
those
latter
languages
a
task
which
has
remained
unfinished
and
to
render
the
allegro
and
the
penseroso
into
miltonian
french
prose
and
le
cid
into
corneillian
english
then
there
were
pinnock
histories
of
greece
and
rome
to
master
and
of
course
the
bible
and
every
sunday
the
collect
the
gospel
and
the
epistle
to
get
by
heart
no
it
was
not
all
beer
and
skittles
it
was
her
pleasure
to
teach
but
alas
not
mine
to
learn
and
we
cost
each
other
many
a
sigh
but
loved
each
other
all
the
more
perhaps
then
we
went
in
the
mornings
my
cousins
and
i
to
saindou
opposite
that
we
might
learn
french
grammar
and
and
but
on
three
afternoons
out
of
the
weekly
six
slade
a
cambridge
sizar
stranded
in
paris
came
to
anglicize
and
neutralize
the
latin
and
greek
we
had
learned
in
the
morning
and
to
show
us
what
sorry
stuff
the
french
had
made
of
them
and
of
their
quantities
perhaps
the
greek
and
latin
quantities
are
a
luxury
of
english
growth
a
mere
social
test
a
little
pitfall
of
our
own
invention
like
the
letter
for
the
tripping
up
of
unwary
pretenders
or
else
french
education
being
so
deplorably
cheap
in
those
days
the
there
could
not
afford
to
take
such
fanciful
superfluities
into
consideration
it
was
not
to
be
done
at
the
price
in
france
be
it
remembered
the
king
and
his
greengrocer
sent
their
sons
to
the
same
school
which
did
not
happen
to
be
saindou
by
the
way
where
it
was
nearly
all
greengrocer
and
no
king
and
the
fee
for
bed
board
and
tuition
in
all
public
schools
alike
was
something
like
thirty
pounds
a
year
the
latin
in
consequence
was
without
the
distinction
that
comes
of
exclusiveness
and
quite
lacked
that
aristocratic
flavor
so
grateful
and
comforting
to
scholar
and
ignoramus
alike
which
the
costly
british
system
and
the
british
accent
alone
can
impart
to
a
dead
language
when
french
is
dead
we
shall
lend
it
a
grace
it
never
had
before
some
of
us
even
manage
to
do
so
already
that
is
no
doubt
why
the
best
french
writers
so
seldom
point
their
morals
and
adorn
their
tales
as
ours
do
with
the
usual
pretty
familiar
and
appropriate
lines
out
of
horace
or
virgil
and
why
latin
is
so
little
quoted
in
french
talk
except
here
and
there
by
a
weary
who
sighs
varium
et
mutabile
semper
femina
as
he
rolls
up
the
unsold
silk
or
exclaims
o
rus
quando
te
aspiciam
as
he
takes
his
railway
ticket
for
asnières
on
the
first
fine
sunday
morning
in
spring
but
this
is
a
digression
and
we
have
wandered
far
away
from
slade
good
old
slade
we
used
to
sit
on
the
tone
posts
outside
the
avenue
gate
and
watch
for
his
appearance
at
a
certain
distant
corner
of
the
winding
street
with
his
green
tail
coat
his
stiff
shirt
collar
his
flat
thumbs
stuck
in
the
armholes
of
his
nankeen
waistcoat
his
long
flat
feet
turned
inward
his
reddish
whiskers
his
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
his
clean
fresh
blooming
virtuous
english
face
the
sight
of
him
was
not
sympathetic
when
he
appeared
at
last
illustration
good
old
slade
occasionally
in
the
course
of
his
tuition
illness
or
domestic
affairs
would
to
his
great
regret
detain
him
from
our
midst
and
the
beatitude
we
would
experience
when
the
conviction
gradually
dawned
upon
us
that
we
were
watching
for
him
in
vain
was
too
deep
for
either
words
or
deeds
or
outward
demonstration
of
any
sort
it
was
enough
to
sit
on
our
stone
posts
and
let
it
steal
over
us
by
degrees
these
beatitudes
were
few
and
far
between
it
would
be
infelicitous
perhaps
to
compare
the
occasional
absences
of
a
highly
respectable
english
tutor
to
an
angel
visits
but
so
we
felt
them
and
then
he
would
make
up
for
it
next
afternoon
that
conscientious
englishman
which
was
fair
enough
to
our
parents
but
not
to
us
and
then
what
extra
severity
as
interest
for
the
beggarly
loan
of
half
an
afternoon
what
rappings
on
knuckles
with
a
beastly
hard
round
polished
english
ruler
it
was
our
way
in
those
days
to
think
that
everything
english
was
beastly
an
expression
our
parents
thought
we
were
much
too
fond
of
using
but
perhaps
we
were
not
without
some
excuse
for
this
unpardonable
sentiment
for
there
was
english
family
in
passy
the
prendergasts
an
older
family
than
ours
that
is
the
parents
and
uncles
and
aunts
were
the
grandmother
dead
and
the
children
grown
up
we
had
not
the
honor
of
their
acquaintance
but
whether
that
was
their
misfortune
and
our
fault
or
i
can
not
tell
let
us
hope
the
former
they
were
of
an
opposite
type
to
ours
and
though
i
say
it
their
type
was
a
singularly
unattractive
one
perhaps
it
may
have
been
the
original
of
those
caricatures
of
our
compatriots
by
which
french
comic
artists
have
sought
to
avenge
waterloo
it
was
stiff
haughty
contemptuous
it
had
prominent
front
teeth
a
high
nose
a
long
upper
lip
a
receding
jaw
it
had
dull
cold
stupid
selfish
green
eyes
like
a
pike
that
swerved
neither
to
right
nor
left
but
looked
steadily
over
heads
as
it
stalked
along
in
its
pride
of
impeccable
british
at
the
sudden
sight
of
it
especially
on
sundays
all
the
cardinal
virtues
became
hateful
on
the
spot
and
respectability
a
thing
to
run
away
from
even
that
smooth
cleanliness
was
so
puritanically
aggressive
as
to
make
one
abhor
the
very
idea
of
soap
its
accent
when
it
spoke
french
in
shops
instead
of
being
musical
and
sweet
and
sympathetic
like
madame
seraskier
was
barbarous
and
grotesque
with
dreadful
ongs
and
angs
and
ows
and
ays
and
its
manner
overbearing
suspicious
and
disdainful
and
then
we
could
hear
its
loud
insolent
english
asides
and
though
it
was
tall
and
straight
and
not
outwardly
deformed
it
looked
such
a
skeleton
at
a
feast
such
a
portentous
carnival
mask
of
solemn
emptiness
such
a
dreary
doleful
unfunny
figure
of
fun
that
one
felt
waterloo
might
some
day
be
forgiven
even
in
passy
but
the
prendergasts
i
have
lived
so
long
away
from
the
world
that
for
all
i
know
this
ancient
british
type
this
grim
ungainly
ghastly
gaunt
and
ominous
bird
of
yore
may
have
become
extinct
like
another
but
less
unprepossessing
bird
the
dodo
whereby
our
state
is
the
more
gracious
but
in
those
days
and
generalizing
somewhat
hastily
as
young
people
are
apt
to
do
we
grew
to
think
that
england
must
be
full
of
prendergasts
and
did
not
want
to
go
there
to
this
universal
english
beastliness
of
things
we
made
a
few
exceptions
it
is
true
but
the
list
was
not
long
tea
mustard
pickles
and
of
all
things
in
the
world
the
english
loaf
of
household
bread
that
came
to
us
once
a
week
as
a
great
treat
and
recompense
for
our
virtues
and
harmonized
so
well
with
passy
butter
it
was
too
delicious
but
there
was
always
a
difficulty
a
dilemma
whether
to
eat
it
with
butter
alone
or
with
cassonade
french
brown
sugar
added
mimsey
knew
her
own
mind
and
loved
it
with
french
brown
sugar
and
if
she
were
not
there
i
would
save
for
her
half
of
my
slices
and
carefully
cassonade
them
for
her
myself
on
the
other
hand
we
thought
everything
french
the
reverse
of
beastly
except
all
the
french
boys
we
knew
and
at
saindou
there
were
about
two
hundred
then
there
were
all
the
boys
in
passy
whose
name
was
legion
and
who
go
to
saindou
and
we
knew
all
the
boys
in
passy
so
that
we
were
not
utterly
bereft
of
material
for
good
stodgy
crusty
patriotic
english
prejudice
nor
did
the
french
boys
fail
to
think
us
beastly
in
return
and
sometimes
to
express
the
thought
especially
the
little
vulgar
boys
whose
playground
was
the
street
the
de
they
hated
our
white
silk
hats
and
large
collars
and
eton
jackets
and
called
us
sacred
godems
as
their
ancestors
used
to
call
ours
in
the
days
of
joan
of
arc
sometimes
they
would
throw
stones
and
then
there
were
collisions
and
bleedings
of
impertinent
little
french
noses
and
runnings
away
of
cowardly
little
french
legs
and
dreadful
wails
of
o
là
là
o
là
là
maman
when
they
were
overtaken
by
english
ones
not
but
what
noses
were
made
to
bleed
now
and
then
unvictoriously
by
a
certain
blacksmith
always
the
same
young
blacksmith
boitard
it
is
always
a
young
blacksmith
who
does
these
things
or
a
young
butcher
of
course
for
the
honor
of
great
britain
one
of
us
finally
licked
him
to
such
a
tune
that
he
has
never
been
able
to
hold
up
his
head
since
it
was
about
a
cat
it
came
off
at
dusk
one
christmas
eve
on
the
isle
of
swans
between
passy
and
grenelle
too
late
to
save
the
cat
i
was
the
hero
of
this
battle
it
now
or
never
i
thought
and
saw
scarlet
and
went
for
my
foe
like
a
maniac
the
ring
was
kept
by
alfred
and
charlie
helped
oddly
enough
by
a
couple
of
male
prendergasts
who
so
far
forgot
themselves
as
to
take
an
interest
in
the
proceedings
madge
and
mimsey
looked
on
terrified
and
charmed
it
did
not
last
long
and
was
worthy
of
being
described
by
homer
or
even
in
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
will
not
describe
it
the
two
prendergasts
seemed
to
enjoy
it
very
much
while
it
lasted
and
when
it
was
over
they
remembered
themselves
again
and
said
nothing
and
stalked
away
as
we
grew
older
and
wiser
we
had
permission
to
extend
our
explorations
to
meudon
versailles
germain
and
other
delightful
places
to
ride
thither
on
hired
horses
after
having
duly
learned
to
ride
at
the
famous
school
of
equitation
in
the
rue
duphot
illustration
ominous
birds
of
yore
also
we
swam
in
those
delightful
summer
baths
in
the
seine
that
are
so
majestically
called
schools
of
natation
and
became
past
masters
in
la
coupe
a
stroke
no
other
englishman
but
ourselves
has
ever
been
quite
able
to
manage
and
in
all
the
different
delicate
nuances
of
la
coulante
la
hussarde
la
la
tout
ce
que
vous
voudrez
also
we
made
ourselves
at
home
in
paris
especially
old
paris
for
instance
there
was
the
island
of
louis
with
its
stately
old
mansions
cour
et
jardin
behind
grim
stone
portals
and
high
walls
where
great
magistrates
and
lawyers
dwelt
in
dignified
seclusion
the
nobles
of
the
rove
but
where
once
had
dwelt
in
days
gone
by
the
greater
nobles
of
the
perhaps
and
knights
templars
like
brian
de
bois
guilbert
and
that
other
more
famous
island
la
cité
where
paris
itself
was
born
where
notre
dame
reared
its
twin
towers
above
the
melancholy
gray
leprous
walls
and
dirty
brown
roofs
of
the
pathetic
little
tumble
down
old
houses
all
out
of
drawing
and
perspective
nestled
like
old
spiders
webs
between
the
buttresses
of
the
great
cathedral
and
on
two
sides
of
the
little
square
in
front
the
place
du
parvis
notre
dame
stood
ancient
stone
dwellings
with
high
slate
roofs
and
elaborately
wrought
iron
balconies
they
seemed
to
have
such
romantic
histories
that
i
never
tired
of
gazing
at
them
and
wondering
what
the
histories
could
be
and
now
i
think
of
it
one
of
these
very
dwellings
must
have
been
the
hôtel
de
gondelaurier
where
according
to
the
most
veracious
historian
that
ever
was
poor
esmeralda
once
danced
and
played
the
tambourine
to
divert
the
fair
damsel
de
gondelaurier
and
her
noble
friends
all
of
whom
she
so
transcended
in
beauty
purity
goodness
and
breeding
although
she
was
but
an
untaught
wandering
gypsy
girl
out
of
the
gutter
and
there
before
them
all
and
the
gay
archer
she
was
betrayed
to
her
final
undoing
by
her
goat
whom
she
had
so
imprudently
taught
how
to
spell
the
beloved
name
of
phébus
close
by
was
the
morgue
that
grewsome
building
which
the
great
etcher
méryon
has
managed
to
invest
with
some
weird
fascination
akin
to
that
it
had
for
me
in
those
days
and
has
now
as
i
see
it
with
the
charmed
eyes
of
memory
la
morgue
what
a
fatal
twang
there
is
about
the
very
name
illustration
settling
an
old
score
after
gazing
one
fill
at
the
horrors
within
as
became
a
english
boy
it
was
but
a
step
to
the
equestrian
statue
of
henri
quatre
on
the
the
oldest
bridge
in
paris
by
the
way
there
astride
his
charger
he
smiled
roy
vert
et
galant
just
midway
between
either
bank
of
the
historic
river
just
where
it
was
most
historic
and
turned
his
back
on
the
paris
of
the
bourgeois
king
with
the
face
and
the
whiskers
and
there
one
stood
spellbound
in
indecision
like
the
ass
of
buridan
between
two
sacks
of
oats
for
on
either
side
north
or
south
of
the
were
to
be
found
enchanting
slums
all
more
attractive
the
ones
than
the
others
winding
up
and
down
hill
and
roundabout
and
in
and
out
like
haunting
illustrations
by
gustave
doré
to
by
balzac
not
seen
or
read
by
me
till
many
years
later
i
beg
to
say
dark
narrow
silent
deserted
streets
that
would
turn
up
afterwards
in
many
a
nightmare
with
the
gutter
in
the
middle
and
towerlets
and
stone
posts
all
along
the
sides
and
high
fantastic
walls
where
it
was
with
bits
of
old
battlement
at
the
top
and
overhanging
boughs
of
sycamore
and
lime
and
behind
them
gray
old
gardens
that
dated
from
the
days
of
louis
le
hutin
and
beyond
and
suggestive
names
printed
in
old
rusty
iron
letters
at
the
street
corners
rue
videgousset
rue
rue
de
la
vieille
truanderie
impasse
de
la
tour
de
nesle
that
appealed
to
the
imagination
like
a
chapter
from
hugo
or
dumas
and
the
way
to
these
was
by
long
tortuous
busy
thoroughfares
most
irregularly
flagged
and
all
alive
with
strange
delightful
people
in
blue
blouses
brown
woollen
tricots
wooden
shoes
red
and
white
cotton
nightcaps
rags
and
patches
most
graceful
girls
with
pretty
feet
and
flashing
eyes
and
no
but
their
own
hair
gay
fat
hags
all
smile
thin
hags
with
faces
of
appalling
wickedness
or
misery
precociously
witty
little
of
either
sex
and
such
cripples
jovial
hunchbacks
lusty
blind
beggars
merry
creeping
paralytics
scrofulous
wretches
who
joked
and
punned
about
their
sores
genial
mendicant
monsters
without
arms
or
legs
who
went
ramping
through
the
mud
on
their
bellies
from
one
underground
to
another
and
priests
and
barefooted
brown
monks
and
demure
sisters
of
charity
and
here
and
there
a
jolly
chiffonnier
with
his
hook
and
his
behind
or
a
cuirassier
or
a
gigantic
carbineer
or
gay
little
hunter
of
africa
or
a
couple
of
bold
gendarmes
riding
abreast
with
their
towering
black
à
poil
or
a
pair
of
pathetic
little
soldiers
conscripts
just
fresh
from
the
country
with
innocent
light
eyes
and
hair
and
freckled
brown
faces
walking
hand
in
hand
and
staring
at
all
the
shops
and
sometimes
at
the
wife
then
a
proletarian
wedding
procession
headed
by
the
bride
and
bridegroom
an
ungainly
pair
in
their
sunday
best
all
singing
noisily
together
then
a
pauper
funeral
or
a
covered
stretcher
followed
by
sympathetic
eyes
on
its
way
to
the
or
the
last
sacrament
with
bell
and
candle
bound
for
the
bedside
of
some
humble
agonizer
and
we
all
uncovered
as
it
went
by
and
then
for
a
running
accompaniment
of
sound
the
clanging
chimes
the
itinerant
street
cries
the
tinkle
of
the
de
coco
the
drum
the
de
chasse
the
organ
of
barbary
the
ubiquitous
pet
parrot
the
the
bawling
monger
and
most
amusing
of
all
the
and
his
son
strophe
and
antistrophe
for
every
minute
the
little
boy
would
yell
out
in
his
shrill
treble
that
his
father
clipped
poodles
for
thirty
sous
and
was
competent
also
to
undertake
the
management
of
refractory
tomcats
upon
which
the
father
would
growl
in
his
solemn
bass
my
son
speaks
the
truth
dit
vrai
and
rising
above
the
general
cacophony
the
din
of
the
eternally
cracking
whip
of
the
heavy
carwheel
jolting
over
the
uneven
stones
the
stamp
and
neigh
of
the
spirited
little
french
and
the
music
of
his
many
bells
and
the
cursing
and
swearing
and
dià
of
his
driver
it
was
all
entrancing
thence
home
to
quite
innocent
suburban
passy
by
the
quays
walking
on
the
top
of
the
stone
parapet
all
the
way
so
as
to
miss
nothing
till
a
gendarme
was
in
sight
or
else
by
the
boulevards
the
rue
de
rivoli
the
champs
élysées
the
avenue
de
st
cloud
and
the
chaussée
de
la
muette
what
a
beautiful
walk
is
there
another
like
it
anywhere
as
it
was
then
in
the
sweet
early
forties
of
this
old
century
and
before
this
poor
scribe
had
reached
his
teens
ah
it
is
something
to
have
known
that
paris
which
lay
at
one
feet
as
one
gazed
from
the
heights
of
passy
with
all
its
pinnacles
and
spires
and
domes
its
arch
of
triumph
its
elysian
fields
its
field
of
mars
its
towers
of
our
lady
its
column
of
july
its
invalids
and
vale
of
grace
and
magdalen
and
place
of
the
concord
where
the
obelisk
reared
its
exotic
peak
by
the
beautiful
unforgettable
fountains
there
flowed
the
winding
river
always
the
same
way
unlike
our
tidal
thames
and
always
full
just
beyond
it
was
spread
that
stately
exclusive
suburb
the
despair
of
the
newly
rich
and
recently
ennobled
where
almost
every
other
house
bore
a
name
which
read
like
a
page
of
french
history
and
farther
still
the
merry
wicked
latin
quarter
and
the
grave
sorbonne
the
pantheon
the
garden
of
plants
on
the
hither
side
in
the
middle
distance
the
louvre
where
the
kings
of
france
had
dwelt
for
centuries
the
tuileries
where
the
king
of
the
french
dwelt
then
and
just
for
a
little
while
yet
well
i
knew
and
loved
it
all
and
most
of
all
i
loved
it
when
the
sun
was
setting
at
my
back
and
innumerable
distant
windows
reflected
the
western
flame
it
seemed
as
though
half
paris
were
on
fire
with
the
cold
blue
east
for
a
background
dear
paris
yes
it
is
something
to
have
roamed
over
it
as
a
small
boy
a
small
english
boy
that
is
a
small
boy
unattended
by
his
mother
or
his
nurse
curious
inquisitive
and
indefatigable
full
of
imagination
all
his
senses
keen
with
the
keenness
that
belongs
to
the
morning
of
life
the
sight
of
a
hawk
the
hearing
of
a
bat
almost
the
scent
of
a
hound
indeed
it
required
a
nose
both
subtle
and
unprejudiced
to
understand
and
appreciate
and
thoroughly
enjoy
that
paris
not
the
paris
of
le
baron
haussmann
lighted
by
gas
and
electricity
and
flushed
and
drained
by
modern
science
but
the
good
old
paris
of
balzac
and
eugène
sue
and
the
paris
of
dim
suspended
from
iron
gibbets
where
once
aristocrats
had
been
hung
of
who
sold
water
from
their
and
delivered
it
at
your
door
for
a
penny
a
pail
to
drink
of
and
wash
in
and
cook
with
and
all
there
were
whole
streets
and
these
by
no
means
the
least
fascinating
and
romantic
where
the
unwritten
domestic
records
of
every
house
were
afloat
in
the
air
outside
it
records
not
all
savory
or
sweet
but
always
full
of
interest
and
charm
one
knew
at
a
sniff
as
one
passed
the
what
kind
of
people
lived
behind
and
above
what
they
ate
and
what
they
drank
and
what
their
trade
was
whether
they
did
their
washing
at
home
and
burned
tallow
or
wax
and
mixed
chicory
with
their
coffee
and
were
of
gruyère
cheese
the
biggest
cheapest
plainest
and
most
formidable
cheese
in
the
world
whether
they
fried
with
oil
or
butter
and
liked
their
omelets
overdone
and
garlic
in
their
salad
and
sipped
brandy
or
anisette
as
a
liqueur
and
were
overrun
with
mice
and
used
cats
or
to
get
rid
of
them
or
neither
and
bought
violets
or
pinks
or
gillyflowers
in
season
and
kept
them
too
long
and
fasted
on
friday
with
red
or
white
beans
or
lentils
or
had
a
dispensation
from
the
pope
or
haply
even
dispensed
with
the
dispensation
for
of
such
a
telltale
kind
were
the
overtones
in
that
complex
odorous
clang
i
will
not
define
its
fundamental
note
ever
there
ever
the
same
big
with
a
warning
of
woe
to
many
households
whose
unheeded
waves
slow
but
sure
and
ominous
as
those
that
rolled
on
great
occasions
from
le
bourdon
de
notre
dame
the
big
ben
of
paris
drove
all
over
the
gay
city
and
beyond
night
and
day
penetrating
every
corner
overflowing
the
most
secret
recesses
drowning
the
very
incense
by
the
pauvre
en
sa
cabane
où
le
chaume
le
couvre
est
sujet
à
ses
lois
et
la
garde
qui
veille
aux
barrières
du
louvre
défend
point
nos
and
here
as
i
write
the
faint
scarcely
perceptible
suspicion
of
a
scent
a
mere
nostalgic
fancy
compound
generic
synthetic
and
an
abstract
olfactory
symbol
of
the
tout
paris
of
fifty
years
ago
comes
back
to
me
out
of
the
past
and
fain
would
i
inhale
it
in
all
its
pristine
fulness
and
vigour
for
scents
like
musical
sounds
are
rare
sublimaters
of
the
essence
of
memory
this
is
a
prodigious
fine
phrase
i
hope
it
means
something
and
scents
need
not
be
seductive
in
themselves
to
recall
the
seductions
of
scenes
and
days
gone
by
alas
scents
can
not
be
revived
at
will
like
an
doux
et
tendre
jadis
oh
that
i
could
hum
or
whistle
an
old
french
smell
i
could
evoke
all
paris
sweet
paris
in
a
single
whiff
in
such
fashion
did
we
three
small
boys
like
the
three
musketeers
the
fame
of
whose
exploits
was
then
filling
all
france
gather
and
pile
up
sweet
memories
to
chew
the
cud
thereof
in
after
years
when
far
away
and
apart
of
all
that
old
and
young
and
from
le
major
to
mimsey
seraskier
all
are
now
dead
but
me
all
except
dear
madge
who
was
so
pretty
and
and
i
have
never
seen
her
since
thus
have
i
tried
with
as
much
haste
as
i
could
command
being
one
of
the
plodding
sort
to
sketch
that
happy
time
which
came
to
an
end
suddenly
and
most
tragically
when
i
was
twelve
years
old
my
dear
and
jovial
father
was
killed
in
a
minute
by
the
explosion
of
a
safety
lamp
of
his
own
invention
which
was
to
have
superseded
sir
humphry
davy
and
made
our
fortune
what
a
brutal
irony
of
fate
so
sanguine
was
he
of
success
so
confident
that
his
ship
had
come
home
at
last
that
he
had
been
in
treaty
for
a
nice
little
old
manor
in
anjou
with
a
nice
little
old
castle
to
match
called
la
marière
which
had
belonged
to
his
ancestors
and
from
which
we
took
our
name
for
we
were
pasquier
de
la
marière
of
quite
a
good
old
family
and
there
we
were
to
live
on
our
own
land
as
and
be
french
for
evermore
under
a
paternal
bourgeois
king
as
a
temporary
until
henri
cinq
comte
de
chambord
should
come
to
his
own
again
and
make
us
counts
and
barons
and
peers
of
france
heaven
knows
what
for
my
mother
who
was
beside
herself
with
grief
went
over
to
london
where
this
miserable
accident
had
occurred
and
had
barely
arrived
there
when
she
was
delivered
of
a
child
and
died
almost
immediately
and
i
became
an
orphan
in
less
than
a
week
and
a
penniless
one
for
it
turned
out
that
my
father
had
by
this
time
spent
every
penny
of
his
own
and
my
mother
capital
and
had
moreover
died
deeply
in
debt
i
was
too
young
and
too
to
feel
anything
but
the
terrible
bereavement
but
it
soon
became
patent
to
me
that
an
immense
alteration
was
to
be
made
in
my
mode
of
life
a
relative
of
my
mother
colonel
ibbetson
who
was
well
off
came
to
passy
to
do
his
best
for
me
and
pay
what
debts
had
been
incurred
in
the
neighborhood
and
settle
my
miserable
affairs
after
a
while
it
was
decided
by
him
and
the
rest
of
the
family
that
i
should
go
back
with
him
to
london
there
to
be
disposed
of
for
the
best
according
to
his
lights
and
on
a
beautiful
june
morning
redolent
of
lilac
and
syringa
gay
with
and
butterflies
and
bumblebees
my
happy
childhood
ended
as
it
had
begun
my
farewells
were
heartrending
to
me
but
showed
that
i
could
inspire
affection
as
well
as
feel
it
and
that
was
some
compensation
for
my
woe
adieu
cher
monsieur
gogo
bonne
chance
et
le
bon
dieu
vous
bénisse
said
le
père
et
la
mère
françois
tears
trickled
down
the
major
hooked
nose
on
to
his
mustache
now
nearly
white
madame
seraskier
strained
me
to
her
kind
heart
and
blessed
and
kissed
me
again
and
again
and
rained
her
warm
tears
on
my
face
and
hers
was
the
last
figure
i
saw
as
our
fly
turned
into
the
rue
de
la
tour
on
our
way
to
london
colonel
ibbetson
exclaiming
gad
who
the
lovely
young
giantess
that
seems
so
fond
of
you
you
little
rascal
hey
by
george
you
young
don
giovanni
i
have
given
something
to
be
in
your
place
and
who
that
nice
old
man
with
the
long
green
coat
and
the
red
ribbon
a
i
suppose
almost
like
a
gentleman
precious
few
frenchmen
can
do
that
such
was
colonel
ibbetson
and
then
and
there
even
as
he
spoke
a
little
drop
of
sullen
chill
dislike
to
my
guardian
and
benefactor
distilled
from
his
voice
his
aspect
the
expression
of
his
face
and
his
way
of
saying
things
suddenly
trickled
into
my
consciousness
never
to
be
whiped
away
as
for
so
poor
mimsey
her
grief
was
so
overwhelming
that
she
could
not
come
out
and
wish
me
goodbye
like
the
others
and
it
led
as
i
afterwards
heard
to
a
long
illness
the
worst
she
ever
had
and
when
she
recovered
it
was
to
find
that
her
beautiful
mother
was
no
more
illustration
madame
seraskier
died
of
the
cholera
and
so
did
le
père
et
la
mère
françois
and
madame
pelé
and
one
of
the
napoleonic
prisoners
not
le
major
and
several
other
people
we
had
known
including
a
servant
of
our
own
thérèse
the
devoted
thérèse
to
whom
we
were
all
devoted
in
return
that
malodorous
tocsin
which
i
have
compared
to
the
big
bell
of
notre
dame
had
warned
and
warned
and
warned
in
vain
the
de
was
broken
up
le
major
and
his
friends
went
and
roosted
on
parole
elsewhere
until
a
good
time
arrived
for
them
when
their
lost
leader
came
back
and
remained
first
as
president
of
the
french
republic
then
as
emperor
of
the
french
themselves
no
more
parole
was
needed
after
that
my
grandmother
and
aunt
plunket
and
her
children
fled
in
terror
to
tours
and
mimsey
went
to
russia
with
her
father
thus
miserably
ended
that
too
happy
septennate
and
so
no
more
at
present
of
joli
lieu
de
ma
part
two
the
next
decade
of
my
outer
life
is
so
uninteresting
even
to
myself
that
i
will
hurry
through
it
as
fast
as
i
can
it
will
prove
dull
reading
i
fear
illustration
my
uncle
ibbetson
as
i
now
called
him
took
to
me
and
arranged
to
educate
and
start
me
in
life
and
make
a
gentleman
of
me
an
english
gentleman
but
i
had
to
change
my
name
and
adopt
his
for
some
reason
i
did
not
know
he
seemed
to
hate
my
father
very
name
perhaps
it
was
because
he
had
injured
my
father
through
life
in
many
ways
and
my
father
had
always
forgiven
him
a
very
good
reason
perhaps
it
was
because
he
had
proposed
to
my
mother
three
times
when
she
was
a
girl
and
had
been
thrice
refused
after
the
third
time
he
went
to
india
for
seven
years
and
just
before
his
departure
my
father
and
mother
were
married
and
a
year
after
that
i
was
born
so
pierre
pasquier
de
la
marière
monsieur
gogo
became
master
peter
ibbetson
and
went
to
bluefriars
the
school
where
he
spent
six
years
an
important
slice
out
of
a
man
life
especially
at
that
age
i
hated
the
garb
i
hated
the
surroundings
the
big
hospital
at
the
back
and
that
reek
of
cruelty
drunkenness
and
filth
the
where
every
other
building
was
either
a
a
or
a
pawnbroker
shop
more
than
all
i
hated
the
gloomy
jail
opposite
where
they
sometimes
hanged
a
man
in
public
on
a
monday
morning
this
dismal
prison
haunted
my
dreams
when
i
wanted
to
dream
of
passy
of
my
dear
dead
father
and
mother
and
madame
seraskier
for
the
first
term
or
two
they
were
ever
in
my
thoughts
and
i
was
always
trying
to
draw
their
profiles
on
desks
and
slates
and
copybooks
till
at
last
all
resemblance
seemed
to
fade
out
of
them
and
then
i
drew
le
major
till
his
side
face
became
quite
demoralized
and
impossible
and
ceased
to
be
like
anything
in
life
then
i
fell
back
on
others
le
père
françois
with
his
eternal
de
and
sabots
stuffed
with
straw
the
dog
médor
the
and
all
the
rest
of
the
menagerie
the
diligence
that
brought
me
away
from
paris
the
heavily
couriers
in
shiny
hats
and
pigtails
and
white
breeches
and
blue
coats
covered
with
silver
buttons
who
used
to
ride
through
passy
on
their
way
to
and
fro
between
the
tuileries
and
st
cloud
on
little
neighing
gray
stallions
with
bells
round
their
necks
and
tails
and
beautiful
heads
like
the
horses
heads
in
the
elgin
marbles
in
my
sketches
they
always
looked
and
walked
and
trotted
the
same
way
to
the
left
or
westward
as
it
would
be
on
the
map
le
major
madame
seraskier
médor
the
diligences
and
couriers
were
all
bound
westward
by
common
consent
all
going
to
london
i
suppose
to
look
after
me
who
was
so
dotingly
fond
of
them
some
of
the
boys
used
to
admire
these
sketches
and
preserve
them
some
of
the
bigger
boys
would
value
my
idealized
profiles
of
madame
seraskier
with
eyelashes
quite
an
inch
in
length
and
an
eye
three
times
the
size
of
her
mouth
and
thus
i
made
myself
an
artistic
reputation
for
a
while
but
it
did
not
last
long
for
my
vein
was
limited
and
soon
another
boy
came
to
the
school
who
surpassed
me
in
variety
and
interest
of
subject
and
could
draw
profiles
looking
either
way
with
equal
ease
he
is
now
a
famous
academician
and
seems
to
have
preserved
much
of
his
old
facility
a
footnote
a
i
have
here
omitted
several
pages
containing
a
description
in
detail
of
my
cousin
life
at
bluefriars
and
also
the
portraits
not
always
flattering
which
he
has
written
of
masters
and
boys
many
of
whom
are
still
alive
and
some
of
whom
have
risen
to
distinction
but
these
sketches
would
be
without
special
interest
unless
the
names
were
given
as
well
and
that
would
be
unadvisable
for
many
reasons
moreover
there
is
not
much
in
what
i
have
left
out
that
has
any
bearing
on
his
subsequent
life
or
the
development
of
his
character
madge
plunket
thus
on
the
whole
my
school
career
was
neither
happy
nor
unhappy
nor
did
i
distinguish
myself
in
any
way
nor
though
i
think
i
was
rather
liked
than
otherwise
make
any
great
or
lasting
friendships
on
the
other
hand
i
did
not
in
any
way
disgrace
myself
nor
make
a
single
enemy
that
i
knew
of
except
that
i
grew
our
of
the
common
tall
and
very
strong
a
more
commonplace
boy
than
i
must
have
seemed
after
my
artistic
vein
gad
run
itself
dry
never
went
to
a
public
school
so
much
for
my
outer
life
at
bluefriars
illustration
a
dream
of
chivalry
but
i
had
an
inner
world
of
my
own
whose
capital
was
passy
whose
fauna
and
flora
were
not
to
be
surpassed
by
anything
in
regent
park
or
the
zoological
gardens
it
was
good
to
think
of
it
by
day
to
dream
of
it
by
night
i
had
not
yet
learned
how
to
dream
there
were
soon
other
and
less
exclusive
regions
however
which
i
shared
with
other
boys
of
that
bygone
day
regions
of
freedom
and
delight
where
i
heard
the
ominous
crack
of
deerslayer
rifle
and
was
friends
with
chingachgook
and
his
noble
son
the
last
alas
of
the
mohicans
where
robin
hood
and
friar
tuck
made
merry
and
exchanged
buffets
with
richard
under
the
tree
where
quentin
durward
happy
squire
of
dames
rode
midnightly
by
their
side
through
the
forests
of
touraine
ah
i
had
my
dream
of
chivalry
happy
times
and
climes
one
must
be
a
in
the
heart
of
foggy
london
to
know
that
nostalgia
not
indeed
but
what
london
has
its
merits
sam
weller
lived
there
and
charley
bates
and
the
irresistible
artful
dodger
and
dick
swiveller
and
his
adorable
marchioness
who
divided
my
allegiance
with
rebecca
of
york
and
sweet
diana
vernon
it
was
good
to
be
an
english
boy
in
those
days
and
care
for
such
friends
as
these
but
it
was
good
to
be
a
french
boy
also
to
have
known
paris
to
possess
the
true
french
feel
of
things
and
the
language
indeed
bilingual
boys
boys
from
their
very
birth
especially
in
french
and
english
enjoy
certain
rare
privileges
it
is
not
a
bad
thing
for
a
since
a
he
must
be
to
hail
from
two
if
he
can
and
revel
now
and
then
in
the
sweets
of
homesickness
for
that
of
his
two
in
which
he
does
not
happen
to
be
and
read
trois
in
the
cloisters
of
bluefriars
or
in
the
dull
dusty
that
serves
for
a
playground
in
so
many
a
french
without
listening
he
hears
all
round
him
the
stodgy
language
of
every
day
and
the
blatant
shouts
of
his
in
the
voices
he
knows
so
painfully
well
those
shrill
trebles
those
cracked
barytones
and
early
basses
there
they
go
bleating
and
croaking
and
yelling
dick
tom
and
harry
or
jules
hector
and
alphonse
how
vaguely
tiresome
and
trivial
and
commonplace
they
are
those
too
familiar
sounds
yet
what
an
additional
charm
they
lend
to
that
so
utterly
different
but
equally
familiar
that
comes
silently
flowing
into
his
consciousness
through
his
rapt
eyes
the
luxurious
sense
of
mental
exclusiveness
and
is
made
doubly
complete
by
the
contrast
and
for
this
strange
enchantment
to
be
well
and
thoroughly
felt
both
his
languages
must
be
native
not
acquired
however
perfectly
every
single
word
must
have
its
roots
deep
down
in
a
personal
past
so
remote
for
him
as
to
be
almost
unremembered
the
very
sound
and
printed
aspect
of
each
must
be
rich
in
childish
memories
of
home
in
all
the
countless
nameless
priceless
associations
that
make
it
sweet
and
fresh
and
strong
and
racy
of
the
soil
oh
porthos
athos
and
how
i
loved
you
and
your
immortal
squires
planchet
grimaud
mousqueton
how
well
and
wittily
you
spoke
the
language
i
adored
better
even
than
good
monsieur
lallemand
the
french
master
at
bluefriars
who
could
wield
the
most
irregular
subjunctives
as
if
they
had
been
mere
feathers
trifles
light
as
air
then
came
the
count
of
who
taught
me
only
too
well
his
terrible
lesson
of
hatred
and
revenge
and
mystères
de
paris
le
juif
and
others
but
no
words
that
i
can
think
of
in
either
can
express
what
i
felt
when
first
through
these
eyes
of
mine
and
deep
into
my
harrowed
soul
came
silently
flowing
the
history
of
poor
esmeralda
a
my
first
love
whose
cruel
fate
filled
with
pity
sorrow
and
indignation
the
last
term
of
my
life
at
school
it
was
the
most
important
the
most
solemn
the
most
event
of
my
school
life
i
read
it
reread
it
and
read
it
again
i
have
not
been
able
to
read
it
since
it
is
rather
long
but
how
well
i
remember
it
and
how
short
it
seemed
then
and
oh
how
short
those
hours

it
was
worth
while
having
been
a
little
french
boy
just
for
a
few
years
i
especially
found
it
so
during
the
holidays
which
i
regularly
spent
at
bluefriars
for
there
was
a
french
circulating
library
in
holborn
close
by

it
was
kept
by
a

old
french
lady
who
had
seen
better
days
and
was
very
kind
to
me
and
did
not
lend
me
all
the
books
i
asked
for
thus
irresistibly
beguiled
by
these
light
wizards
of

dreamed
away
most
of

to
deplore

other
dunces
when
it
was
too
late
and
i
was
not
only
given
to
dream
by
day
i
dreamed
by
night
my
sleep
was
full
of
dreams
terrible
nightmares
exquisite

strange
scenes
full
of
inexplicable

the

no

ineffable
false

unspeakable
false
terror
and
distress
strange
phantoms
only
seen
as
in
a
glass
darkly
chase
each
other
without
rhyme
or
reason
and
play
across
the
twilit
field
and
through
the
dark
recesses
of
our
clouded
and
imperfect
consciousness
and
the
false
terrors
and

however
unspeakable
are
no
worse
than
such
real
terrors
and
distress
as
are
only
too
often
the

lot
of
man
or
even
so
bad
but
the
ineffable
false
joys
transcend
all
possible
human
felicity
while
they
last
and
a
little
while
it
is
we
wake
and
wonder
and
recall
the
slight
foundation
on
which
such
bliss
has
seemed
to
rest
what
matters
the
foundation
if
but
the
bliss
be
there

what

have

for

indeed
what
hells
we
have
often
made
of
this
both
for
ourselves
and
others
and
at
really
such
a
very
small
cost
of
ingenuity
after
all
perhaps
the
biggest
and
most
benighted
fools
have
been
the
best
whereas
the

of
our

is
but
a
poor
perfunctory
conception
for
all
that
the

among

have
done
their

to
decorate

it

life
there

to

these

of

common
to
many
of
the

ineffable
joys
are

not
a

that
there
exist
in
the
human
brain
hidden

dormant

of
bliss
unsuspected
hitherto
to
be
developed
some
day
perhaps
and
placed
within
the
reach
of
all

sleepers
alike
a
sense
of
ineffable
joy
attainable
at

and
equal
in
intensity
and

to
let
us
say
an
attack
of

would
go
far
to
equalize
the
sorrowful
conditions
under
which
we
live
but
there
is
one
thing
which
as
a
i
never
dreamed
namely
that
i
and
one
other
holding
a
torch
should
one
day
by
common
consent
find
our
happiness
in
exploring
these
mysterious
caverns
of
the
brain
and
should
lay
the
foundations
of
order
where
only
misrule
had
been
before
and
out
of
all
those
unreal
waste
and
transitory
realms
of
illusion
evolve
a
real
stable
and
habitable
world
which
all
who
run
may
reach
at
last
i
left
school
for
good
and
paid
a
visit
to
my
uncle
ibbetson
in
hopshire
where
he
was
building
himself
a
lordly
new
on
his
own
land
as
the
old
one
he
had
inherited
a
year
or
two
ago
was
no
longer
good
enough
for
him
it
was
an
uninteresting
coast
on
the
german
ocean
without
a
rock
or
a
cliff
or
a
pier
or
a
tree
even
without
cold
gray
stones
for
the
sea
to
break
on
nothing
but
sand
a
bourgeois
kind
of
sea
charmless
in
its
best
moods
and
not
very
terrible
in
its
wrath
except
to
a
few
stray
fishermen
whom
it
employed
and
did
not
seem
to
reward
very
munificently
inland
it
was
much
the
same
one
always
thought
of
the
country
as
gray
until
one
looked
and
found
that
it
was
green
and
then
if
one
were
old
and
wise
one
thought
no
more
about
it
and
turned
one
gaze
inward
moreover
it
seemed
to
rain
incessantly
but
it
was
the
country
and
the
sea
after
bluefriars
and
the
cloisters
after
newgate
bartholomew
and
smithfield
and
one
could
fish
and
bathe
in
the
sea
after
all
and
ride
in
the
country
and
even
follow
the
hounds
a
little
later
which
would
have
been
a
joy
beyond
compare
if
one
had
not
been
blessed
with
an
uncle
who
thought
one
rode
like
a
french
tailor
and
told
one
so
and
mimicked
one
in
the
presence
of
charming
young
ladies
who
rode
in
perfection
in
fact
it
was
heaven
itself
by
comparison
and
would
have
remained
so
longer
but
for
colonel
ibbetson
efforts
to
make
a
gentleman
of
me
an
english
gentleman
what
is
a
gentleman
it
is
a
grand
old
name
but
what
does
it
mean
at
one
time
to
say
of
a
man
that
he
is
a
gentleman
is
to
confer
on
him
the
highest
title
of
distinction
we
can
think
of
even
if
we
are
speaking
of
a
prince
at
another
to
say
of
a
man
that
he
is
a
gentleman
is
almost
to
stigmatize
him
as
a
social
outcast
unfit
for
the
company
of
his
kind
even
if
it
is
only
one
haberdasher
speaking
of
another
is
a
gentleman
and
yet
who
the
prince
of
darkness
was
one
and
so
was
john
halifax
if
we
are
to
believe
those
who
knew
them
best
and
so
was
one
pelham
according
to
the
late
sir
edward
bulwer
earl
of
lytton
etc
and
it
certainly
seemed
as
if
ought
to
know
and
i
was
to
be
another
according
to
roger
ibbetson
esquire
of
ibbetson
hall
late
colonel
of
the
and
it
certainly
seemed
as
if
he
ought
to
know
too
the
word
was
as
constantly
on
his
lips
when
talking
to
as
though
instead
of
having
borne
her
commission
he
were
a
hairdresser
assistant
who
had
just
come
into
an
independent
fortune
this
course
of
tuition
began
pleasantly
enough
before
i
left
london
by
his
sending
me
to
his
tailors
who
made
me
several
beautiful
suits
especially
an
evening
suit
which
has
lasted
me
for
life
alas
and
these
after
the
uniform
of
the
school
were
like
an
initiation
to
the
splendors
of
freedom
and
manhood
colonel
ibbetson
or
uncle
ibbetson
as
i
used
to
call
him
was
my
mother
first
cousin
my
grandmother
biddulph
was
the
sister
of
his
father
the
late
archdeacon
ibbetson
a
very
pious
learned
and
exemplary
divine
of
good
family
but
his
mother
the
archdeacon
second
wife
had
been
the
only
child
and
heiress
of
an
immensely
rich
pawnbroker
by
name
mendoza
a
portuguese
jew
with
a
dash
of
colored
blood
in
his
veins
besides
it
was
said
and
indeed
this
remote
african
strain
still
showed
itself
in
uncle
ibbetson
thick
lips
wide
open
nostrils
and
big
black
eyes
with
yellow
whites
and
especially
in
his
long
splay
feet
which
gave
both
himself
and
the
best
bootmaker
in
london
a
great
deal
of
trouble
otherwise
and
in
spite
of
his
ugly
face
he
was
not
without
a
certain
air
of
distinction
being
very
tall
and
powerfully
built
he
wore
stays
and
an
excellent
wig
for
he
was
prematurely
bald
and
he
carried
his
hat
on
one
side
which
in
my
untutored
eyes
made
him
look
very
much
like
a
but
not
quite
like
a
to
wear
your
hat
jauntily
cocked
over
one
eye
and
yet
look
like
a
gentleman
it
can
be
done
i
am
told
and
has
been
and
is
even
still
it
is
not
perhaps
a
very
lofty
achievement
but
such
as
it
is
it
requires
a
somewhat
rare
combination
of
social
and
physical
gifts
in
the
wearer
and
the
possession
of
either
semitic
or
african
blood
does
not
seem
to
be
one
of
these

drew

he
was
a
bachelor
and
his
domestic
arrangements
had
been
irregular
and
i
will
not
dwell
upon
them
but
his
house
as
far
as
it
went
seemed
to
promise
better

an
extraordinary
little
man
full
of

became
my
friend
and

me
to
smoke
and
drink

and

he
did
his
work
well
but
of
an
evening
he
used
to
drink
more
than
was
good
for
him
and
rave
about
shelley
his
only
poet
he
would
recite
the
skylark
his
only
poem
with
uncertain
and
a
rather
cockney
accent
to
thee
blythe

thou
never

that
from

it
thy
full
in
profuse
strains
of
hunpremeditated
as
the
evening
wore
on
his
recitations
became
low
comic
and
quite
admirable
for
accent
and
humour
he
could
imitate
all
the
actors
in
london
none
of
which
i
had
seen
so
well
as
to
transport
me
with
delight
and
wonder
and
all
this
with
nobody
but
me
for
an
audience
as
we
sat
smoking
and
drinking
together
in
his
room
at
the
ibbetson
arms
i
felt
grateful
to
adoration
later
still
he
would
become
sentimental
again
and
dilate
to
me
on
the
joys
of
his
wedded
life
on
the
extraordinary
of
intellect
and
beauty
of
lintot
first
he
would
describe
to
me
the
beauties
of
her
mind
and
compare
her
to
and
felicia
hemans
then
he
would
fall
back
on
her
physical
perfections
there
was
nobody
worthy
to
be
compared
to
her
in
these
but
i
draw
the
veil
he
was
very
egotistical
whatever
he
did
whatever
he
liked
whatever
belonged
to
him
was
better
than
anything
else
in
world
and
he
was
cleverer
than
any
one
else
except
lintot
to
whom
he
yielded
the
palm
and
then
he
would
cheer
up
and
become
funny
again
in
fact
his
was
quite
extraordinary
and
what
is
more
extraordinary
still
it
was
not
a
bit
offensive
at
least
to
me
perhaps
because
he
was
such
a
tiny
little
man
or
because
much
of
this
vanity
of
his
seemed
to
have
no
very
solid
foundation
for
it
was
not
of
the
gifts
i
most
admired
in
him
that
he
was
vainest
or
because
it
came
out
most
when
he
was
most
tipsy
and
genial
tipsiness
redeems
so
much
or
else
because
he
was
most
vain
about
things
i
should
never
have
been
vain
about
myself
and
the
most
unpardonable
vanity
in
others
is
that
which
is
secretly
our
own
whether
we
are
conscious
of
it
or
not
illustration
i
felt
grateful
to
adoration
and
then
he
was
the
first
funny
man
i
had
ever
met
what
a
gift
it
is
he
was
always
funny
when
he
tried
to
be
whether
one
laughed
with
him
or
at
him
and
i
loved
him
for
it
nothing
on
earth
is
more
pathetically
pitiable
than
the
funny
man
when
he
still
tries
and
succeeds
no
longer
the
moment
lintot
vein
was
exhausted
he
had
the
sense
to
leave
off
and
begin
to
cry
which
was
still
funny
and
then
i
would
jump
out
of
his
clothes
and
into
his
bed
and
be
asleep
in
a
second
with
the
tears
still
trickling
down
his
little
nose
and
even
that
was
funny
but
next
morning
he
was
stern
and
alert
and
indefatiguable
as
though
gin
and
poetry
and
conjugal
love
had
never
been
and
fun
were
a
capital
crime
uncle
ibbetson
thought
highly
of
him
as
an
architect
but
not
otherwise
he
simply
made
use
of
him
he
a
terrible
little
snob
of
course
and
has
got
an
in
his
head
as
if
were
a
capital
crime
but
he
very
clever
look
at
that
campanile
and
then
he
cheap
my
boy
cheap
there
were
several
fine
houses
in
fine
parks
not
very
far
from
ibbetson
hall
but
although
uncle
ibbetson
appeared
in
name
and
wealth
and
social
position
to
be
on
a
par
with
their
owners
he
was
not
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
any
of
them
or
even
of
acquaintance
as
far
as
i
know
and
spoke
of
them
with
contempt
as
barbarians
people
with
whom
he
had
nothing
in
common
perhaps
they
too
had
found
out
this
incompatibility
especially
the
ladies
for
as
i
was
i
was
not
long
in
discovering
that
his
manner
towards
those
of
the
other
sex
was
not
always
such
as
to
please
either
of
them
or
their
husbands
or
fathers
or
brothers
the
way
he
looked
at
them
was
enough
indeed
most
of
his
and
acquaintances
through
life
had
belonged
to
the
de
the
not
i
should
imagine
the
best
school
of
manners
in
the
world
on
the
other
hand
he
was
very
friendly
with
some
families
in
the
town
the
doctor
the
rector
his
own
agent
a
brother
officer
and
bosom
friend
who
had
ceased
to
love
him
since
he
received
his
pay
and
he
used
to
take
lintot
and
me
to
parties
there
and
he
was
the
life
of
those
parties
he
sang
little
french
songs
with
no
voice
but
quite
a
good
french
accent
and
told
little
anecdotes
with
no
particular
point
but
in
french
and
italian
so
that
the
point
was
never
missed
and
we
all
laughed
and
admired
without
quite
knowing
why
except
that
he
was
the
lord
of
the
manor
on
these
festive
occasions
poor
lintot
confidence
and
power
of
amusing
seemed
to
desert
him
altogether
he
sat
glum
in
a
corner
though
a
radical
and
a
sceptic
and
a
man
he
was
much
impressed
by
the
social
status
of
the
army
and
the
church
of
the
doctor
a
very
clever
and
accomplished
person
and
the
best
educated
man
for
miles
around
he
thought
little
but
the
rector
the
colonel
the
poor
captain
even
now
a
mere
seemed
to
fill
him
with
respectful
awe
and
for
his
pains
he
was
cruelly
snubbed
by
captain
and
rector
and
their
plain
daughters
who
little
guessed
what
talents
he
concealed
and
thought
him
quite
a
common
little
man
hardly
fit
to
turn
over
the
leaves
of
their
music
it
soon
became
pretty
evident
that
ibbetson
was
very
much
smitten
with
a
deane
the
widow
of
a
brewer
a
very
handsome
woman
indeed
in
her
own
estimation
and
mine
and
everybody
else
except
lintot
who
said
pooh
you
should
see
my
wife
her
mother
glyn
excelled
us
all
in
her
admiration
of
colonel
ibbetson
for
instance
deane
would
play
some
common
little
waltz
of
the
cheap
kind
that
is
never
either
remembered
or
forgotten
and
glyn
would
exclaim
not
that
and
ibbetson
would
say
charming
charming
whose
is
it
rossini
mozart
why
no
my
dear
colonel
do
you
remember
your
ah
so
it
is
i
had
quite
forgotten
and
general
laughter
and
applause
would
burst
forth
at
such
a
natural
mistake
on
the
part
of
our
great
man
well
i
could
neither
play
nor
sing
and
found
it
far
easier
by
this
time
to
speak
english
than
french
especially
to
english
people
who
were
ignorant
of
any
language
but
their
own
yet
sometimes
colonel
ibbetson
would
seem
quite
proud
of
me
deux
mètres
bien
sonnés
he
would
say
alluding
to
my
stature
et
le
profil
which
he
would
pronounce
without
the
two
little
dots
on
the
and
afterwards
if
he
had
felt
his
evening
a
pleasant
one
if
he
had
sung
all
he
knew
if
deane
had
been
more
than
usually
loving
and
and
i
had
distinguished
myself
by
skilfully
turning
over
the
leaves
when
her
mother
had
played
the
piano
he
would
tell
me
as
we
walked
home
together
that
i
did
credit
to
his
name
and
that
i
would
make
an
excellent
figure
in
the
world
as
soon
as
i
had
myself
that
i
must
get
another
from
his
tailor
just
an
eighth
of
an
inch
longer
in
the
tails
that
i
should
have
a
commission
in
his
old
regiment
the
eleventeenth
royal
bounders
a
deuced
crack
cavalry
regiment
and
see
the
world
and
break
a
few
hearts
it
is
not
for
nothing
that
our
friends
have
pretty
wives
and
sisters
and
finally
marry
some
beautiful
young
heiress
of
title
and
make
a
home
for
him
when
he
was
a
poor
solitary
old
fellow
very
little
would
do
for
him
a
crust
of
bread
a
glass
of
wine
and
water
and
a
clean
napkin
a
couple
of
rooms
and
an
old
piano
and
a
few
good
books
for
of
course
ibbetson
hall
would
be
mine
and
every
penny
he
possessed
in
the
world
illustration
all
this
in
confidential
french
lest
the
very
clouds
should
hear
us
and
with
the
familiar
thee
and
thou
of
which
i
did
not
care
to
return
it
did
not
seem
to
bode
very
serious
intentions
towards
deane
and
would
scarcely
have
pleased
her
mother
or
else
if
something
had
crossed
him
and
deane
had
flirted
outrageously
with
somebody
else
and
he
had
not
been
asked
to
sing
or
somebody
else
had
he
would
assure
me
in
good
round
english
that
i
was
the
most
infernal
lout
that
ever
disgraced
a
or
ate
a
man
out
of
house
and
home
and
that
he
was
sick
and
ashamed
of
me
why
ca
you
sing
you
d
d
french
milksop
the
d
d
of
a
father
of
yours
could
sing
fast
enough
if
he
could
do
nothing
else
confound
him
why
ca
you
talk
french
you
infernal
british
booby
why
ca
you
hand
round
the
tea
and
muffins
confound
you
why
twice
glyn
dropped
her
and
had
to
pick
it
up
herself
what
the
other
end
of
the
room
were
you
well
you
should
have
skipped
the
room
and
picked
it
up
and
handed
it
to
her
with
a
pretty
speech
like
a
gentleman
when
i
was
your
age
i
was
on
the
lookout
for
ladies
to
drop
or
their
fans
i
never
missed
then
he
would
take
me
out
to
shoot
with
him
for
it
was
quite
essential
that
an
english
gentleman
should
be
a
sportsman
a
terrible
ordeal
to
both
of
us
a
snipe
that
i
did
not
want
to
kill
in
the
least
would
sometimes
rise
and
fly
right
and
left
like
a
flash
of
lightning
and
i
would
miss
it
always
and
he
would
d
n
me
for
a
son
of
a
confounded
french
micawber
and
miss
the
next
himself
and
get
into
a
rage
and
thrash
his
dog
a
pointer
that
i
was
very
fond
of
once
he
thrashed
her
so
cruelly
that
i
saw
scarlet
and
nearly
yielded
to
the
impulse
of
emptying
both
my
barrels
in
his
broad
back
if
i
had
done
so
it
would
have
passed
for
a
mere
mishap
after
all
and
saved
many
future
complications
one
day
he
pointed
out
to
me
a
small
bird
pecking
in
a
field
an
extremely
pretty
bird
i
think
it
was
a
skylark
and
whispered
to
me
in
his
most
sarcastic
manner
look
here
you
peter
without
any
salt
do
you
think
if
you
were
to
kneel
down
and
rest
your
gun
comfortably
on
this
gate
without
making
a
noise
and
take
a
careful
aim
you
could
manage
to
shoot
that
bird
i
heard
of
some
frenchmen
who
would
be
equal
to
i
said
i
would
try
and
resting
my
gun
as
he
told
me
i
carefully
aimed
a
couple
of
yards
above
the
bird
head
and
mentally
ejaculating
to
thee
blythe
i
fired
both
barrels
for
fear
of
any
to
ibbetson
and
the
bird
naturally
flew
away
after
this
he
never
took
me
out
shooting
with
him
again
and
indeed
i
had
discovered
to
my
discomfiture
that
i
the
friend
and
admirer
and
emulator
of
natty
bumppo
the
deerslayer
i
the
familiar
of
the
last
of
the
mohicans
and
his
father
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
blood
least
of
all
of
blood
shed
by
myself
and
for
my
own
amusement
the
only
beast
that
ever
fell
to
my
gun
during
those
shootings
with
uncle
ibbetson
was
a
young
rabbit
and
that
more
by
accident
than
design
although
i
did
not
tell
uncle
ibbetson
so
as
i
picked
it
off
the
ground
and
felt
its
poor
little
warm
narrow
chest
and
the
last
beats
of
its
heart
under
its
weak
ribs
and
saw
the
blood
on
its
fur
i
was
smitten
with
pity
shame
and
remorse
and
settled
with
myself
that
i
would
find
some
other
road
to
english
gentlemanhood
than
the
slaying
of
innocent
wild
things
whose
happy
life
seems
so
well
worth
living
illustration
to
thee
blythe
sperrit
i
must
eat
them
i
suppose
but
i
would
never
shoot
them
any
more
my
hands
at
least
should
be
clean
of
blood
henceforward
alas
the
irony
of
fate
the
upshot
of
all
this
was
that
he
confided
to
deane
the
task
of
licking
his
cub
of
a
nephew
into
shape
she
took
me
in
hand
with
right
began
by
teaching
me
how
to
dance
that
i
might
dance
with
her
at
the
coming
hunt
ball
and
i
did
so
nearly
all
night
to
my
infinite
joy
and
triumph
and
to
the
disgust
of
colonel
ibbetson
who
could
dance
much
better
than
i
to
the
disgust
indeed
of
many
smart
men
in
red
coats
and
black
for
she
was
considered
the
belle
of
the
evening
illustration
the
dancing
lesson
of
course
i
fell
or
fancied
i
fell
in
love
with
her
to
her
extreme
distress
she
gave
me
every
encouragement
partly
for
fun
partly
to
annoy
colonel
ibbetson
whom
she
had
apparently
grown
to
hate
and
indeed
from
the
way
he
spoke
of
her
to
me
this
trainer
of
english
gentlemen
he
well
deserved
that
she
should
hate
him
he
never
had
the
slightest
intention
of
marrying
her
that
is
certain
and
yet
he
had
made
her
the
talk
of
the
place
and
here
i
may
state
that
ibbetson
was
one
of
those
singular
men
who
go
through
life
afflicted
with
the
mania
that
they
are
fatally
irresistible
to
women
he
was
never
weary
of
pursuing
them
not
through
any
special
love
of
gallantry
for
its
own
sake
i
believe
but
from
the
mere
wish
to
appear
as
a
don
giovanni
in
the
eyes
of
others
nothing
made
him
happier
than
to
be
seen
whispering
mysteriously
in
corners
with
the
prettiest
woman
in
the
room
he
did
not
seem
to
perceive
that
for
one
woman
silly
or
vain
or
vulgar
enough
to
be
flattered
by
his
idiotic
persecution
a
dozen
would
loathe
the
very
sight
of
him
and
show
it
plainly
enough
this
vanity
had
increased
with
years
and
assumed
a
very
dangerous
form
he
became
indiscreet
and
more
disastrous
still
he
told
lies
the
very
dead
the
honored
and
irreproachable
dead
were
not
even
safe
in
their
graves
it
was
his
revenge
for
unforgotten
slights
he
who
kisses
and
tells
he
who
tells
even
though
he
has
not
kissed
what
can
be
said
for
him
what
should
be
done
to
him
ibbetson
one
day
expiated
this
miserable
craze
with
his
life
and
the
man
who
took
it
more
by
accident
than
design
it
is
true
has
not
yet
found
it
in
his
heart
to
feel
either
compunction
or
regret
so
there
was
a
great
row
between
ibbetson
and
myself
he
d
d
and
confounded
and
abused
me
in
every
way
and
my
father
before
me
and
finally
struck
me
and
i
had
sufficient
not
to
strike
him
back
but
left
him
then
and
there
with
as
much
dignity
as
i
could
muster
thus
unsuccessfully
ended
my
brief
experience
of
english
country
life
a
little
hunting
and
shooting
and
fishing
a
little
dancing
and
flirting
just
enough
of
each
to
show
me
i
was
unfit
for
all
a
remembrance
full
of
humiliation
but
not
altogether
without
charm
there
was
the
beauty
of
sea
and
open
sky
and
changing
country
weather
and
the
beauty
of
deane
who
made
a
fool
of
me
to
revenge
herself
on
colonel
ibbetson
for
trying
to
make
a
fool
of
her
whereby
he
became
the
of
the
neighborhood
for
at
least
nine
days
and
i
revenged
myself
on
both
heroically
as
i
thought
though
where
the
heroism
comes
in
and
where
the
revenge
does
not
appear
quite
patent
for
i
ran
away
to
london
and
enlisted
in
her
majesty
household
cavalry
where
i
remained
a
twelvemonth
and
was
happy
enough
and
learned
a
great
deal
more
good
than
harm
then
i
was
bought
out
and
articled
to
lintot
architect
and
surveyor
a
conclave
of
my
relatives
agreeing
to
allow
me
ninety
pounds
a
year
for
three
years
then
all
hands
were
to
be
washed
of
me
altogether
a
footnote
a
i
have
thought
it
better
to
leave
out
in
its
entirety
my
cousin
account
of
his
short
career
as
a
private
soldier
it
consists
principally
of
personal
descriptions
that
are
not
altogether
unprejudiced
he
seems
never
to
have
quite
liked
those
who
were
placed
in
authority
above
him
either
at
school
or
in
the
army
madge
plunket
so
i
took
a
small
lodging
in
pentonville
to
be
near
lintot
and
worked
hard
at
my
new
profession
for
three
years
during
which
nothing
of
importance
occurred
in
my
outer
life
after
this
lintot
employed
me
as
a
salaried
clerk
and
i
do
not
think
he
had
any
reason
to
complain
of
me
nor
did
he
make
any
complaint
i
was
worth
my
hire
i
think
and
something
over
which
i
never
got
and
never
asked
for
nor
did
i
complain
of
him
for
with
all
his
little
foibles
of
vanity
irascibility
and
egotism
and
a
certain
he
was
a
good
fellow
and
a
very
clever
one
his
paragon
of
a
wife
was
by
no
means
the
beautiful
person
he
had
made
her
out
to
be
nor
did
anybody
but
he
seem
to
think
her
so
she
was
a
little
older
than
himself
very
large
and
massive
with
stern
but
not
irregular
features
and
a
very
high
forehead
she
had
a
slight
tendency
to
baldness
and
colorless
hair
that
she
wore
in
an
austere
curl
on
each
side
of
her
face
and
a
menacing
little
topknot
on
her
occiput
she
had
been
a
unitarian
and
a
governess
was
fond
of
good
long
words
like
johnson
and
very
censorious
but
one
of
my
husband
intimate
friends
general
who
was
cornet
in
the
life
guards
in
my
poor
cousin
time
writes
me
that
he
remembers
him
well
as
far
and
away
the
tallest
and
handsomest
lad
in
the
whole
regiment
of
immense
physical
strength
unimpeachable
good
conduct
and
a
thorough
gentleman
from
top
to
toe
her
husband
occasional
derelictions
in
the
matter
of
grammar
and
accent
must
have
been
very
trying
to
her
illustration
pentonville
she
knew
her
own
mind
about
everything
under
the
sun
and
expected
that
other
people
should
know
it
too
and
be
of
the
same
mind
as
herself
and
yet
she
was
not
proud
indeed
she
was
a
very
dragon
of
humility
and
had
raised
injured
meekness
to
the
rank
of
a
militant
virtue
and
well
she
knew
how
to
be
master
and
mistress
in
her
own
house
but
with
all
this
she
was
an
excellent
wife
to
lintot
and
a
devoted
mother
to
his
children
who
were
very
plain
and
subdued
and
adored
their
father
so
that
lintot
who
thought
her
venus
and
diana
and
minerva
in
one
was
the
happiest
man
in
all
pentonville
and
on
the
whole
she
was
kind
and
considerate
to
me
and
i
always
did
my
best
to
please
her
moreover
a
gift
for
which
i
could
never
be
too
grateful
she
presented
me
with
an
old
square
piano
which
had
belonged
to
her
mother
and
had
done
duty
in
her
till
lintot
gave
her
a
new
one
for
she
was
a
highly
cultivated
musician
of
the
severest
classical
type
it
became
the
principal
ornament
of
my
small
which
it
nearly
filled
and
on
it
i
tried
to
learn
my
notes
and
would
pick
out
with
one
finger
the
old
beloved
melodies
my
father
used
to
sing
and
my
mother
play
on
the
harp
to
sing
myself
was
it
seems
out
of
the
question
my
voice
which
i
trust
was
not
too
disagreeable
when
i
was
content
merely
to
speak
became
as
that
of
a
under
a
blanket
whenever
i
strove
to
express
myself
in
song
my
larynx
refused
to
produce
the
notes
i
held
so
accurately
in
my
mind
and
the
result
was
disaster
on
the
other
hand
in
my
mind
i
could
sing
most
beautifully
once
on
a
rainy
day
inside
an
islington
omnibus
i
mentally
sang
adelaida
with
the
voice
of
sims
reeves
an
unpardonable
liberty
to
take
and
although
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
so
i
sang
it
even
better
than
he
for
i
made
myself
shed
tears
so
much
so
that
a
kind
old
gentleman
sitting
opposite
seemed
to
feel
for
me
very
much
i
also
had
the
faculty
of
remembering
any
tune
i
once
heard
and
would
whistle
it
correctly
ever
after
even
one
of
uncle
ibbetson
waltzes
as
an
instance
of
this
worth
recalling
one
night
i
found
myself
in
guildford
street
walking
in
the
same
direction
as
another
belated
individual
only
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
who
just
as
the
moon
came
out
of
a
cloud
was
moved
to
whistle
he
whistled
exquisitely
and
what
was
more
he
whistled
quite
the
most
beautiful
tune
i
had
ever
heard
i
felt
all
its
changes
and
modulations
its
majors
and
minors
just
as
if
a
whole
band
had
been
there
to
play
the
accompaniment
so
cunning
and
expressive
a
whistler
was
he
and
so
entranced
was
i
that
i
made
up
my
mind
to
cross
over
and
ask
him
what
it
was
your
melody
or
your
life
but
he
suddenly
stopped
at
no
and
let
himself
in
with
his
key
before
i
could
prefer
my
humble
request
well
i
went
whistling
that
tune
all
next
day
and
for
many
days
after
without
ever
finding
out
what
it
was
till
one
evening
happening
to
be
at
the
lintots
i
asked
lintot
who
happened
to
be
at
the
piano
if
she
knew
it
and
began
to
whistle
it
once
more
to
my
delight
and
surprise
she
straightway
accompanied
it
all
through
a
wonderful
condescension
in
so
severe
a
purist
and
i
did
not
make
a
single
wrong
note
yes
said
lintot
it
a
pretty
catchy
little
tune
of
a
kind
to
achieve
immediate
popularity
now
i
apologize
humbly
to
the
reader
for
this
digression
but
if
he
be
musical
he
will
forgive
me
for
that
tune
was
the
serenade
of
schubert
and
i
had
never
even
heard
schubert
name
and
having
thus
duly
apologized
i
will
venture
to
transgress
and
digress
anew
and
mention
here
a
kind
of
melodic
malady
a
singular
obsession
to
which
i
am
subject
and
which
i
will
call
unconscious
musical
cerebration
i
am
never
without
some
tune
running
in
my
head
never
for
a
moment
not
that
i
am
always
aware
of
it
existence
would
be
insupportable
if
i
were
what
part
of
my
brain
sings
it
or
rather
in
what
part
of
my
brain
it
sings
itself
i
can
not
imagine
probably
in
some
useless
corner
full
of
cobwebs
and
lumber
that
is
fit
for
nothing
else
but
it
never
leaves
off
now
it
is
one
tune
now
another
now
a
song
words
now
sometimes
it
is
near
the
surface
so
to
speak
and
i
am
vaguely
conscious
of
it
as
i
read
or
work
or
talk
or
think
sometimes
to
make
sure
it
is
there
i
have
to
dive
for
it
deep
into
myself
and
i
never
fail
to
find
it
after
a
while
and
bring
it
up
to
the
top
it
is
the
carnival
of
venice
let
us
say
then
i
let
it
sink
again
and
it
changes
without
my
knowing
so
that
when
i
take
another
dive
the
carnival
of
venice
has
become
il
mio
tesoro
or
the
marseillaise
or
pretty
little
polly
perkins
of
paddington
green
and
heaven
knows
what
tunes
unheard
and
unperceived
this
internal
has
been
grinding
meanwhile
sometimes
it
intrudes
itself
so
persistently
as
to
become
a
nuisance
and
the
only
way
to
get
rid
of
it
is
to
whistle
or
sing
myself
for
instance
i
may
be
mentally
reciting
for
my
solace
and
delectation
some
beloved
lyric
like
the
waterfowl
or
tears
idle
tears
or
break
break
break
and
all
the
while
between
the
lines
this
fiend
of
a
subcerebral
vocalist
like
a
wandering
minstrel
in
a
distant
square
insists
on
singing
cheer
boys
cheer
or
tommy
make
room
for
your
uncle
tunes
i
can
not
abide
with
words
accompaniment
and
all
complete
and
not
quite
so
refined
an
accent
as
i
could
wish
so
that
i
have
to
leave
off
my
recitation
and
whistle
du
bon
tabac
in
quite
a
different
key
to
exorcise
it
but
this
at
least
i
will
say
for
this
never
still
small
voice
of
mine
its
intonation
is
always
perfect
it
keeps
ideal
time
and
its
quality
though
rather
thin
and
somewhat
nasal
and
quite
peculiar
is
not
unsympathetic
sometimes
indeed
as
in
that
islington
omnibus
i
can
compel
it
to
imitate
the
tones
of
some
singer
i
have
recently
heard
and
thus
make
for
myself
a
ghostly
music
which
is
not
to
be
despised
occasionally
too
and
quite
unbidden
it
would
warble
little
impromptu
inward
melodies
of
my
own
composition
which
often
seemed
to
me
extremely
pretty
and
quaint
but
one
is
not
a
fair
judge
of
one
own
productions
especially
during
the
heat
of
inspiration
and
i
had
not
the
means
of
recording
them
as
i
had
never
learned
the
musical
notes
what
the
world
has
lost
now
whose
this
small
voice
was
i
did
not
find
out
till
many
years
later
it
was
not
in
spite
of
such
rare
accomplishments
and
resources
within
myself
i
was
not
a
happy
or
contented
young
man
nor
had
my
discontent
in
it
anything
of
the
divine
i
disliked
my
profession
for
which
i
felt
no
particular
aptitude
and
would
fain
have
followed
another
poetry
science
literature
music
painting
sculpture
for
all
of
which
i
most
unblushingly
thought
myself
better
fitted
by
the
gift
of
nature
i
disliked
pentonville
which
although
clean
virtuous
and
respectable
left
much
to
be
desired
on
the
score
of
shape
color
romantic
tradition
and
local
charm
and
i
would
sooner
have
lived
anywhere
else
in
the
let
us
say
yes
indeed
even
on
the
fifth
branch
of
the
third
tree
on
the
side
as
you
leave
the
arc
de
triomphe
like
one
of
those
classical
heroes
in
henri
murger
de
i
disliked
my
brother
apprentices
and
did
not
get
on
well
with
them
especially
a
certain
very
clever
but
vicious
and
deformed
youth
called
judkins
who
seemed
to
have
conceived
an
aversion
for
me
from
the
first
he
is
now
an
associate
of
the
royal
academy
they
thought
i
gave
myself
airs
because
i
did
not
share
in
their
dissipations
such
dissipations
as
i
could
have
afforded
would
have
been
cheap
and
nasty
indeed
yet
such
pothouse
dissipation
seemed
to
satisfy
them
since
they
took
not
only
a
pleasure
in
it
but
a
pride
they
even
took
a
pride
in
a
sick
headache
and
liked
it
if
it
were
the
result
of
a
debauch
on
the
previous
night
and
were
as
pompously
about
a
black
eye
got
in
a
squabble
at
the
argyll
rooms
as
if
it
had
been
the
victoria
cross
to
pass
the
night
in
a
police
cell
was
such
glory
that
it
was
worth
while
pretending
they
had
done
so
when
it
was
untrue
they
looked
upon
me
as
a
muff
a
milksop
and
a
prig
and
felt
the
greatest
contempt
for
me
and
if
they
did
not
openly
show
it
it
was
only
because
they
were
not
quite
so
fond
of
black
eyes
as
they
made
out
so
i
left
them
to
their
inexpensive
joys
and
betook
myself
to
pursuits
of
my
own
among
others
to
the
cultivation
of
my
body
after
methods
i
had
learned
in
the
life
guards
i
belonged
to
a
gymnastic
and
fencing
and
boxing
club
of
which
i
was
a
most
assiduous
frequenter
a
more
persevering
and
never
was
and
i
became
in
time
an
athlete
as
wiry
and
lean
as
a
greyhound
just
under
fifteen
stone
and
four
inches
over
six
feet
in
height
which
was
considered
very
tall
thirty
years
ago
especially
in
pentonville
where
the
distinction
often
brought
me
more
contumely
than
respect
altogether
a
most
formidable
person
but
that
i
was
of
a
timid
nature
afraid
to
hurt
and
the
peacefulest
creature
in
the
world
my
old
love
for
slums
revived
and
i
found
out
and
haunted
the
worst
in
london
they
were
very
good
slums
but
they
were
not
the
slums
of
paris
they
manage
these
things
better
in
france
even
cow
cross
where
the
metropolitan
railway
now
runs
between
cross
and
farringdon
street
cow
cross
that
whilom
labyrinth
of
and
thieves
dens
with
the
famous
fleet
ditch
running
underneath
it
all
the
while
lacked
the
fascination
and
mystery
of
mediaeval
romance
there
were
no
memories
of
such
charming
people
as
le
roi
des
truands
and
gringoire
and
esmeralda
with
a
sigh
one
had
to
fall
back
on
visions
of
fagin
and
bill
sykes
and
nancy
and
as
to
the
actual
denizens
one
gazed
with
a
dull
wondering
pity
at
the
poor
pale
rickety
children
the
slatternly
coarse
women
who
never
smiled
except
when
drunk
the
dull
morose
miserable
men
how
they
lacked
the
grace
of
french
deformity
the
ease
and
lightness
of
french
depravity
the
sympathetic
distinction
of
french
grotesqueness
how
unterrible
they
were
who
preferred
the
fist
to
the
noiseless
and
insidious
knife
who
fought
with
their
hands
instead
of
their
feet
quite
loyally
and
reserved
the
kicks
of
their
hobnailed
boots
for
their
recalcitrant
wives
and
then
there
was
no
morgue
one
missed
one
morgue
badly
and
smithfield
it
would
split
me
truly
to
the
heart
as
le
major
used
to
say
to
watch
the
poor
beasts
that
came
on
certain
days
to
make
a
short
station
in
that
hideous
on
their
way
to
the
what
bludgeons
have
i
seen
descend
on
beautiful
bewildered
dazed
meek
eyes
so
thickly
fringed
against
the
country
sun
on
soft
moist
tender
nostrils
that
clouded
the
poisonous
reek
with
a
fragrance
of
the
fields
what
torture
of
silly
sheep
and
genially
cynical
pigs
the
very
dogs
seemed
demoralized
and
brutal
as
their
masters
and
there
one
day
i
had
an
adventure
a
dirty
bout
at
fisticuffs
most
humiliating
in
the
end
for
me
and
which
showed
that
chivalry
is
often
its
own
reward
like
virtue
even
when
the
chivalrous
are
young
and
big
and
strong
and
have
learned
to
box
a
brutal
young
drover
wantonly
kicked
a
sheep
and
as
i
thought
broke
her
and
in
my
indignation
i
took
him
by
the
ear
and
flung
him
round
onto
a
heap
of
mud
and
filth
he
rose
and
squared
at
me
in
a
most
plucky
fashion
he
hardly
came
up
to
my
chin
and
i
refused
to
fight
him
a
crowd
collected
round
us
and
as
i
tried
to
explain
to
the
the
cause
of
our
quarrel
he
managed
to
hit
me
in
the
face
with
a
very
muddy
fist
bravo
little
shouted
the
crowd
and
he
squared
up
again
i
felt
wretchedly
ashamed
and
warded
off
all
his
blows
telling
him
that
i
could
not
hit
him
or
i
should
kill
him
yah
shouted
the
crowd
again
go
it
little
un
let
it
the
long
un
showing
the
white
feather
and
finally
i
gave
him
a
slight
backhander
that
made
his
nose
bleed
and
seemed
to
demoralize
him
completely
yah
shouted
the
crowd
one
yer
own
size
i
looked
round
in
despair
and
rage
and
picking
out
the
biggest
man
i
could
see
said
are
big
enough
the
crowd
roared
with
laughter
well
i
dessay
i
might
do
at
a
pinch
he
replied
and
i
tried
to
slap
his
face
but
missed
it
and
received
such
a
tremendous
box
on
the
ear
that
i
was
giddy
for
a
second
or
two
and
when
i
recovered
i
found
him
still
grinning
at
me
i
tried
to
hit
him
again
and
again
but
always
missed
and
at
last
without
doing
me
any
particular
damage
he
laid
me
flat
three
times
running
onto
the
very
heap
where
i
had
flung
the
drover
the
crowd
applauding
madly
dazed
hatless
and
panting
and
covered
with
filth
i
stared
at
him
in
hopeless
impotence
he
put
out
his
hand
and
said
you
all
right
ai
yer
i
i
yer
my
name
tom
sayers
if
you
a
me
i
should
gone
down
like
a
ninepin
and
i
ai
so
sure
as
i
should
ever
got
up
again
he
was
to
become
the
most
famous
in
england
i
wrung
his
hand
and
thanked
him
and
offered
him
a
sovereign
which
he
refused
and
then
he
led
me
into
a
room
in
a
close
by
where
he
washed
and
brushed
me
down
and
insisted
on
treating
me
to
a
glass
of
i
have
had
a
fondness
for
ever
since
and
a
respect
for
the
noble
science
i
had
never
felt
before
he
was
many
inches
shorter
than
i
and
did
not
look
at
all
the
hercules
he
was
he
told
me
i
was
the
strongest
built
man
for
a
youngster
that
he
had
ever
seen
barring
that
i
was
rather
leggy
i
do
not
know
if
he
was
sincere
or
not
but
no
possible
compliment
could
have
pleased
me
more
such
is
the
vanity
of
youth
and
here
although
it
savors
somewhat
of
vaingloriousness
i
can
not
resist
the
temptation
of
relating
another
adventure
of
the
same
kind
but
in
which
i
showed
to
greater
advantage
it
was
on
a
oddly
enough
and
i
was
returning
with
lintot
and
one
of
his
boys
from
a
walk
in
the
highgate
fields
as
we
plodded
our
dirty
way
homeward
through
the
caledonian
road
we
were
stopped
by
a
crowd
outside
a
a
gigantic
drayman
they
always
seem
bigger
than
they
really
are
was
squaring
up
to
a
poor
drunken
lout
of
a
navvy
not
half
his
size
who
had
been
put
up
to
fight
him
and
who
was
quite
incapable
of
even
an
attempt
it
he
could
scarcely
lift
his
arms
i
thought
at
first
it
was
only
and
as
little
joe
lintot
wanted
to
see
i
put
him
up
on
my
shoulder
just
as
the
drayman
who
had
been
drinking
but
was
not
drunk
and
had
a
most
fiendishly
brutal
face
struck
the
poor
tipsy
wretch
with
all
his
might
between
the
eyes
and
felled
him
it
was
like
a
bullock
to
the
delight
of
the
crowd
little
joe
a
very
gentle
and
sensitive
boy
began
to
cry
and
his
father
who
had
the
pluck
of
a
wanted
to
interfere
in
spite
of
his
diminutive
stature
i
was
also
beside
myself
with
indignation
and
pulling
off
my
coat
and
hat
which
i
gave
to
lintot
made
my
way
to
the
drayman
who
was
offering
to
fight
any
three
men
in
the
crowd
an
offer
that
met
with
no
response
now
then
you
cowardly
skunk
i
said
tucking
up
my
stand
up
and
i
will
knock
every
tooth
down
your
ugly
throat
his
face
went
the
colors
of
a
mottled
stilton
cheese
and
he
asked
what
i
meddled
with
him
for
a
ring
formed
itself
and
i
felt
the
sympathy
of
the
crowd
me
this
time
a
very
agreeable
sensation
now
then
up
with
your
arms
i
going
to
kill
you
i
ai
going
to
fight
you
mister
i
ai
going
to
fight
just
you
let
me
alone
illustration
oh
yes
you
are
or
you
going
on
your
to
be
pardon
for
being
a
brutal
cowardly
skunk
and
i
gave
him
a
slap
on
the
face
that
rang
like
a
a
most
finished
satisfactory
and
successful
slap
this
time
my
tingle
at
the
bare
remembrance
he
tried
to
escape
but
was
held
opposite
to
me
he
began
to
snivel
and
whimper
and
said
he
had
never
meddled
with
me
and
asked
what
should
i
meddle
with
him
for
then
down
on
your
knees
quick
this
instant
and
i
made
as
if
i
were
going
to
begin
serious
business
at
once
and
no
mistake
so
down
he
plumped
on
his
knees
and
there
he
actually
fainted
from
sheer
excess
of
emotion
as
i
was
helped
on
with
my
coat
i
tasted
for
once
in
my
life
the
sweets
of
popularity
and
knew
what
it
was
to
be
the
idol
of
a
mob
little
joey
lintot
and
his
brothers
and
sisters
who
had
never
held
me
in
any
particular
regard
before
that
i
knew
of
worshipped
me
from
that
day
forward
and
i
should
be
insincere
if
i
did
not
confess
that
on
that
one
occasion
i
was
rather
pleased
with
myself
although
the
very
moment
i
stood
opposite
the
huge
hulking
brute
who
had
looked
so
formidable
from
afar
i
felt
with
a
not
unpleasant
sense
of
relief
that
he
did
not
stand
a
chance
he
was
only
big
and
even
at
that
i
beat
him
the
real
honors
of
the
day
belonged
to
lintot
who
i
am
convinced
was
ready
to
act
the
david
to
that
goliath
he
had
the
real
stomach
for
fighting
which
i
lacked
as
very
tall
men
are
often
said
to
do
and
that
perhaps
is
why
i
have
made
so
much
of
my
not
very
wonderful
prowess
on
that
occasion
not
indeed
that
i
am
physically
a
coward
at
least
i
do
not
think
so
if
i
thought
i
were
i
should
avow
it
with
no
more
shame
than
i
should
avow
that
i
had
a
bad
digestion
or
a
weak
heart
which
makes
cowards
of
us
all
it
is
that
i
hate
a
row
and
violence
and
bloodshed
even
from
a
nose
any
nose
either
my
own
or
my
neighbor
there
are
slums
at
the
east
end
of
london
that
many
fashionable
people
know
something
of
by
this
time
i
got
to
know
them
by
heart
in
addition
to
the
charm
of
the
mere
slum
there
was
the
eternal
fascination
of
the
seafaring
element
of
jack
ashore
a
lovable
creature
who
touches
nothing
but
what
he
adorns
it
in
his
own
peculiar
fashion
i
constantly
haunted
the
docks
where
the
smell
of
tar
and
the
sight
of
ropes
and
masts
filled
me
with
unutterable
longings
for
the
sea
for
distant
lands
for
anywhere
but
where
it
was
my
fate
to
be
i
talked
to
ship
captains
and
mates
and
sailors
and
heard
many
marvellous
tales
as
the
reader
may
well
believe
and
framed
for
myself
visions
of
cloudless
skies
and
sapphire
seas
and
coral
reefs
and
groves
of
spice
and
dusky
youths
in
painted
plumage
roving
and
friendly
isles
where
a
lovely
barefooted
neuha
would
wave
her
torch
and
lead
me
her
torquil
by
the
hand
through
caverns
of
bliss
especially
did
i
haunt
a
wharf
by
london
bridge
from
whence
two
steamers
the
and
the
i
believe
started
on
alternate
days
for
i
used
to
watch
the
happy
passengers
bound
for
france
some
of
them
in
their
holiday
spirits
already
fraternizing
together
on
the
sunny
deck
and
fussing
with
and
magazines
and
novels
and
bottles
of
bitter
beer
or
retiring
before
the
funnel
to
smoke
the
pipe
of
peace
illustration
the
boulogne
steamer
the
sound
of
the
boiler
getting
up
steam
what
delicious
music
it
was
would
it
ever
get
up
steam
for
me
the
very
smell
of
the
cabin
the
very
feel
of
the
brass
gangway
and
the
steps
were
delightful
and
on
the
snowy
cloth
were
the
cold
beef
and
ham
the
beautiful
fresh
mustard
the
bottles
of
pale
ale
and
stout
oh
happy
travellers
who
could
afford
all
this
and
france
into
the
bargain
soon
would
a
large
white
awning
make
the
a
paradise
from
which
to
watch
the
quickly
gliding
panorama
of
the
thames
the
bell
would
sound
for
like
me
to
go
ashore
que
diable
faire
dans
cette
galère
as
uncle
ibbetson
would
have
said
the
steamer
disengaging
itself
from
the
wharf
with
a
pleasant
of
manly
throats
and
a
slow
intermittent
plashing

carefully
pick
its
sunny
eastward
way
among
the
small
craft
of
the
river
while
a
few
handkerchiefs
were
waved
in
a
friendly
farewell
oh
to
stand
by
that
unseasonably
man
at
the
wheel
and
watch
paul
and
london
bridge
and
the
tower
of
london
fade
out
of
sight
never
never
to
see
them
again
no
for
me
sometimes
i
would
turn
my
footsteps
westward
and
fill
my
hungry
jealous
eyes
with
a
sight
of
the
gay
summer
procession
in
hyde
park
or
listen
to
the
band
in
kensington
gardens
and
see
beautiful
welldressed
women
and
hear
their
sweet
refined
voices
and
happy
laughter
and
a
longing
would
come
into
my
heart
more
passionate
than
my
longing
for
the
sea
and
france
and
distant
lands
and
quite
as
unutterable
i
would
even
forget
neuha
and
her
torch
after
this
it
was
a
dreary
downfall
to
go
and
dine
for
tenpence
all
by
myself
and
finish
up
with
a
book
at
my
solitary
lodgings
in
pentonville
the
book
would
not
let
itself
be
read
it
sulked
and
had
to
be
laid
down
for
beautiful

at

times
more
happily

i
would
slake
my
thirst

long
walks
into
the
country
hampstead

my

after
such

fragrant
impressions

had
a
better
taste
the
little
front
parlor
in
pentonville
was
more
like

like

i
read
all
i
could
get
in

everything
came
as
grist
to
that
most
melancholy
mill

mind

tried
to
write
i
tried
to
draw
i
tried
to
make
myself
an
inner
life
apart
from
the
sordid
commonplace
ugliness
of
my
outer
one
a
private
oasis
of
my
own
and

little

mentally
above

circumstances

it
had
pleased

fates
to
place

a
footnote
a
it
is
with
great
reluctance
that
i
now
come
to
my
cousin
account
of
deplorable
opinions
he
held
at
that
period
of
his
life
on
the
most
important
subject
that
can
ever
engross
the
mind
of
man
i
have
left
out
but
i
feel
that
in
suppressing
it
altogether
i
should
rob
his
sad
story
of
all
its
moral
significance
for
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
most
of
his
unhappiness
is
attributable
to
the
defective
religious
training
of
his
childhood
and
that
his
parents
otherwise
the
best
and
kindest
people
i
have
ever
known
incurred
a
terrible
responsibility
when
they
determined
to
leave
him
unbiased
as
he
calls
it
at
that
tender
and
susceptible
age
when
the
mind
is
wax
to
receive
marble
to
retain

it
goes
without
saying
that
like
many
thoughtful
youths
of
a
melancholy
temperament
impecunious
and
discontented
with
their
lot
and
much
given
to
the
smoking
of
strong
tobacco
on
an
empty
stomach
i
continuously
brooded
on
the
problems
of
existence
and
determinism
the
whence
and
why
and
whither
of
man
the
origin
of
evil
the
immortality
of
the
soul
the
futility
of
life

made
myself
very
miserable
over
such
questions

the
inquisitive

peeped
through
the
blinds
of

at

have
been
rewarded

the
touching
spectacle
of

in

over
the
black
and

could

tear

loneliness

it
never
once
occurred
to
me
to
seek
relief
in
the
bosom
of
any
church
some
types
are
born
and
not
made
i
was
a
born
infidel
if
ever
there
was
a
congenital
agnostic
one
agnostically
constituted
from
his
very
birth
it
was
i
not
that
i
had
ever
heard
such
an
expression
as
agnosticism
it
is
an
invention
of
late
years
fait
de
la
prose
toute
ma
vie
sans
le
savoir
but
almost
the
first
conscious
dislike
i
can
remember
was
for
the
black
figure
of
the
priest
and
there
were
several
of
these
figures
in
passy
monsieur
le
major
called
them
and
seemed
to
hold
them
in
light
esteem
seraskier
hated
them
his
gentle
catholic
wife
had
grown
to
distrust
them
my
loving
heretic
mother
loved
them
not
my
father
a
catholic
born
and
bred
had
an
equal
aversion
they
had
persecuted
his
gods
the
thinkers
philosophers
and
scientific
discoverers
galileo
bruno
copernicus
and
brought
to
his
mind
the
cruelties
of
the
holy
inquisition
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
and
i
always
pictured
them
as
burning
little
heretics
alive
if
they
had
their
will
eton
jackets
white
hats
and
all
i
have
no
doubt
they
were
in
reality
the
best
and
kindest
of
men
the
parson
and
parsons
were
not
lacking
in
pentonville
was
not
so
insidiously
repellent
as
the
passy
priest
but
he
was
by
no
means
to
me
a
picturesque
or
sympathetic
apparition
with
his
weddedness
his
whiskers
his
black
trousers
his
his
tall
hat
his
little
white
tie
his
consciousness
of
being
a
gentleman
by
profession
most
unattractive
also
were
the
cheap
churches
wherein
he
spoke
the
word
to
his
flock
with
scarcely
one
of
whom
his
wife
would
have
sat
down
to
dinner
especially
if
she
had
been
chosen
from
among
them
illustration
sunday
in
pentonville
to
watch
that
flock
pouring
in
of
a
sunday
morning
or
afternoon
or
evening
at
the
summons
of
those
bells
and
pouring
out
again
after
the
long
service
and
banal
perfunctory
sermon
was
depressing
weekdays
in
pentonville
were
depressing
enough
but
sundays
were
depressing
beyond
words
though
nobody
seemed
to
think
so
but
myself
early
training
had
acclimatized
them
i
have
outlived
those
physical
antipathies
of
my
salad
days
even
the
sight
of
an
anglican
bishop
is
no
longer
displeasing
to
me
on
the
contrary
and
i
could
absolutely
rejoice
in
the
beauty
of
a
cardinal
indeed
i
am
now
friends
with
both
a
parson
and
a
priest
and
do
not
know
which
of
the
two
i
love
and
respect
the
most
they
ought
to
hate
me
but
they
do
not
they
pity
me
too
much
i
suppose
i
am
too
negative
to
rouse
in
either
the
deep
theological
hate
and
all
the
little
hate
that
the
practice
of
love
and
charity
has
left
in
their
kind
hearts
is
reserved
for
each
other
an
unquenchable
hate
in
which
they
seem
to
glory
and
which
rages
all
the
more
that
it
has
to
be
concealed
it
saddens
me
to
think
that
i
am
a
bone
of
contention
between
them
and
yet
for
all
my
unbelief
the
bible
was
my
favorite
book
and
the
psalms
my
adoration
and
most
truly
can
i
affirm
that
my
mental
attitude
has
ever
been
one
of
reverence
and
humility
but
every
argument
that
has
ever
been
advanced
against
christianity
and
i
think
i
know
them
all
by
this
time
had
risen
spontaneously
and
unprompted
within
me
and
they
have
all
seemed
to
me
unanswerable
and
indeed
as
yet
unanswered
nor
had
any
creed
of
which
i
ever
heard
appeared
to
me
either
credible
or
attractive
or
even
sensible
but
for
the
central
figure
of
the
deity
a
deity
that
in
no
case
could
ever
be
mine
the
and
unalterable
conception
that
had
wrought
itself
into
my
consciousness
whether
i
would
or
no
was
that
of
a
being
infinitely
more
abstract
remote
and
inaccessible
than
any
the
genius
of
mankind
has
ever
evolved
after
its
own
image
and
out
of
the
needs
of
its
own
heart
inscrutable
unthinkable
unspeakable
above
all
human
passions
beyond
the
reach
of
any
human
appeal
one
upon
whose
attributes
it
was
futile
to
speculate
one
whose
name
was
not
the
thought
of
total
annihilation
was
uncongenial
but
had
no
terror
even
as
a
child
i
had
shrewdly
suspected
that
hell
was
no
more
than
a
vulgar
threat
for
naughty
little
boys
and
girls
and
heaven
than
a
vulgar
bribe
from
the
casual
way
in
which
either
was
meted
out
to
me
as
my
probable
portion
by
servants
and
such
people
according
to
the
way
i
behaved
such
things
were
never
mentioned
to
me
by
either
my
father
or
mother
or
le
major
or
the
seraskiers
the
only
people
in
whom
i
trusted
but
for
the
bias
against
the
priest
i
was
left
unbiassed
at
that
tender
and
susceptible
age
i
had
learned
my
catechism
and
read
my
bible
and
used
to
say
the
lord
prayer
as
i
went
to
bed
and
god
bless
papa
and
mamma
and
the
rest
in
the
usual
perfunctory
manner
never
a
word
against
religion
was
said
in
my
hearing
by
those
few
on
whom
i
had
pinned
my
childish
faith
on
the
other
hand
no
such
importance
was
attached
to
it
apparently
as
was
attached
to
the
virtues
of
truthfulness
courage
generosity
politeness
and
especially
consideration
for
others
high
or
low
human
and
animal
alike
i
imagine
that
my
parents
must
have
compromised
the
matter
between
them
and
settled
that
i
should
work
out
all
the
graver
problems
of
existence
for
myself
when
i
came
to
a
thinking
age
out
of
my
own
conscience
and
such
knowledge
of
life
as
i
should
acquire
and
such
help
as
they
would
no
doubt
have
given
me
according
to
their
lights
had
they
survived
i
did
so
and
made
myself
a
code
of
morals
to
live
by
in
which
religion
had
but
a
small
part
for
me
there
was
but
one
sin
and
that
was
cruelty
because
i
hated
it
though
nature
for
inscrutable
purposes
of
her
own
almost
teaches
it
as
a
virtue
all
sins
that
did
not
include
cruelty
were
merely
sins
against
health
or
taste
or
or
public
expediency
was
impossible
we
could
only
to
will
freely
and
that
only
within
the
limits
of
a
small
triangle
whose
sides
were
heredity
education
and
circumstance
a
little
geometrical
arrangement
of
my
own
of
which
i
felt
not
a
little
proud
although
it
does
not
quite
go
on
perhaps
because
it
is
only
a
triangle
that
is
we
could
will
fast
enough
fast
but
could
not
will
to
will
fortunately
for
we
were
not
fit
as
yet
and
for
a
long
time
to
come
to
be
trusted
constituted
as
we
are
even
the
characters
of
a
novel
must
act
according
to
the
nature
training
and
motives
their
creator
the
novelist
has
supplied
them
with
or
we
put
the
novel
down
and
read
something
else
for
human
nature
must
be
consistent
with
itself
in
fiction
as
well
as
in
fact
even
in
its
madness
there
must
be
a
method
so
how
could
the
will
be
free
to
pray
for
any
personal
boon
or
remission
of
evil
to
bend
the
knee
or
lift
one
voice
in
praise
or
thanksgiving
for
any
earthly
good
that
had
befallen
one
either
through
inheritance
or
chance
or
one
own
successful
endeavor
was
in
my
eyes
simply
futile
but
putting
its
futility
aside
it
was
an
act
of
servile
presumption
of
wheedling
impertinence
not
without
suspicion
of
a
lively
sense
of
favors
to
come
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
the
jews
a
superstitious
and
people
who
know
what
they
want
and
do
not
care
how
they
get
it
must
have
taught
us
to
pray
like
that
it
was
not
the
sweet
simple
child
innocently
beseeching
that
might
be
fine
for
its
holiday
or
that
santa
claus
would
be
generous
it
was
the
cunning
trader
fawning
flattering
propitiating
bribing
with
fulsome
sycophantic
praise
an
insult
in
itself
as
well
as
working
for
his
own
success
here
and
hereafter
and
his
enemy
confounding
it
was
the
grovelling
of
the
dog
without
the
dog
love
stronger
than
even
its
fear
or
its
sense
of
what
an
attitude
for
one
whom
god
had
made
after
his
own
image
even
towards
his
maker
the
only
permissible
prayer
was
a
prayer
for
courage
or
resignation
for
that
was
a
prayer
turned
inward
an
appeal
to
what
is
best
in
ourselves
our
honor
our
stoicism
our
and
for
a
small
detail
grace
before
and
after
meals
seemed
to
me
especially
and
iniquitous
when
there
were
so
many
with
scarcely
ever
a
meal
to
say
grace
for
the
only
decent
and
proper
grace
was
to
give
half
of
one
meal
away
not
indeed
that
i
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
so
but
at
least
i
had
the
grace
to
reproach
myself
for
my
want
of
charity
and
that
was
my
only
grace
fortunately
since
we
had
no
of
our
own
the
tendency
that
impelled
us
was
upward
like
the
sparks
and
bore
us
with
it
the
good
and
the
bad
and
the
worst
and
the
best
by
seeing
this
clearly
and
laying
it
well
to
heart
the
motive
was
supplied
to
us
for
doing
all
we
could
in
furtherance
of
that
upward
tendency
aider
le
bon
that
we
might
rise
the
faster
and
reach
him
the
sooner
if
he
were
and
when
once
the
human
will
has
been
set
going
like
a
rocket
or
a
clock
or
a
and
in
the
right
direction
what
can
it
not
achieve
we
should
in
time
control
circumstance
instead
of
being
controlled
thereby
education
would
day
by
day
become
more
adapted
to
one
consistent
end
and
finally
we
should
guide
heredity
with
our
own
hands
instead
of
leaving
it
to
blind
chance
unless
indeed
a
paternal
government
wisely
took
the
reins
and
only
sanctioned
the
union
of
people
who
were
thoroughly
in
love
with
each
other
after
due
and
careful
elimination
of
the
unfit
thus
cruelty
should
at
least
be
put
into
harness
and
none
of
its
valuable
energy
wasted
on
wanton
experiments
as
it
is
by
nature
and
thus
as
the
boy
is
father
to
the
man
should
the
human
race
one
day
be
father
to
what
that
is
just
where
my
speculations
would
arrest
themselves
that
was
the
x
of
a
sum
in
rule
of
three
not
to
be
worked
out
by
peter
ibbetson
architect
and
surveyor
wharton
street
pentonville
as
the
is
to
shakespeare
so
is
shakespeare
to
x
as
the
female
chimpanzee
is
to
the
venus
of
milo
so
is
the
venus
of
milo
to
x
finally
multiply
these
two
x
by
each
other
and
try
to
conceive
the
result
such
was
crudely
the
simple
creed
i
held
at
this
time
and
such
as
it
was
i
had
worked
it
all
out
for
myself
with
no
help
from
outside
a
poor
thing
but
mine
own
or
as
i
expressed
it
in
the
words
of
de
musset
mon
verre
pas
grand
mais
je
bois
dans
mon
verre
for
though
such
ideas
were
in
the
air
like
wholesome
clouds
they
had
not
yet
condensed
themselves
into
printed
words
for
the
million
people
did
not
dare
to
write
about
these
things
as
they
do
at
present
in
popular
novels
and
cheap
magazines
that
all
who
run
may
read
and
learn
to
think
a
little
for
themselves
and
honestly
say
what
they
think
without
having
to
dread
a
howl
of
execration
clerical
and
lay
and
it
was
not
only
that
i
thought
like
this
and
could
not
think
otherwise
it
was
that
i
felt
like
this
and
could
not
feel
otherwise
and
i
should
have
appeared
to
myself
as
wicked
weak
and
base
had
i
ever
even
to
think
or
feel
otherwise
however
personally
despairing
of
this
life
a
traitor
to
what
i
jealously
guarded
as
my
best
instincts
and
yet
to
me
the
faith
of
others
if
but
unaggressive
humble
and
sincere
had
often
seemed
touching
and
pathetic
and
sometimes
even
beautiful
as
childish
things
seem
sometimes
beautiful
even
in
those
who
are
no
longer
children
and
should
have
put
them
away
it
had
caused
many
heroic
lives
and
rendered
many
obscure
lives
blameless
and
happy
and
then
its
fervor
and
passion
seemed
to
burn
with
a
lasting
flame
at
brief
moments
now
and
then
and
especially
in
the
young
unfaith
can
be
as
fervent
and
as
passionate
as
faith
and
just
as
narrow
and
unreasonable
as
found
but
alas
its
flame
was
intermittent
and
its
light
was
not
a
kindly
light
it
had
no
food
for
babes
it
could
not
comfort
the
sick
or
sorry
nor
resolve
into
submissive
harmony
the
inner
discords
of
the
soul
nor
compensate
us
for
our
own
failures
and
shortcomings
nor
make
up
to
us
in
any
way
for
the
success
and
prosperity
of
others
who
did
not
choose
to
think
as
we
did
it
was
without
balm
for
wounded
pride
or
stay
for
weak
despondency
or
consolation
for
bereavement
its
steep
and
rugged
thoroughfares
led
to
no
promised
land
of
beatitude
and
there
were
no
soft
by
the
way
its
only
weapon
was
steadfastness
its
only
shield
endurance
its
earthly
hope
the
common
weal
its
earthly
prize
the
opening
of
all
roads
to
knowledge
and
the
release
from
a
craven
inheritance
of
fear
its
final
guerdon
sleep
who
knows
sleep
was
not
bad
so
that
simple
sincere
humble
devout
earnest
fervent
passionate
and
young
unbelievers
like
myself
had
to
be
very
strong
and
brave
and
which
i
was
not
and
very
much
in
love
with
what
they
conceived
to
be
the
naked
truth
a
figure
of
doubtful
personal
attractions
at
first
sight
to
tread
the
ways
of
life
with
that
unvarying
cheerfulness
confidence
and
serenity
which
the
believer
claims
as
his
own
special
and
particular
appanage
so
much
for
my
profession
of
unfaith
shared
had
i
but
known
it
by
many
much
older
and
wiser
and
better
educated
than
i
and
only
reached
by
them
after
great
sacrifice
of
illusions
and
terrible
pangs
of
a
struggle
and
a
wrench
that
i
was
spared
through
my
kind
parents
thoughtfulness
when
i
was
a
little
boy
it
thus
behooved
me
to
make
the
most
of
this
life
since
for
all
i
knew
or
believed
or
even
hoped
to
the
contrary
we
must
die
not
indeed
that
i
might
eat
and
drink
and
be
merry
heredity
and
education
had
not
inclined
me
that
way
i
suppose
and
circumstances
did
not
allow
it
but
that
i
might
try
and
live
up
to
the
best
ideal
i
could
frame
out
of
my
own
conscience
and
the
past
teaching
of
mankind
and
man
whose
conception
of
the
infinite
and
divine
has
been
so
inadequate
has
furnished
us
with
such
human
examples
ancient
and
modern
hebrew
pagan
buddhist
christian
agnostic
and
what
not
as
the
best
of
us
can
only
hope
to
follow
at
a
distance
i
would
sometimes
go
to
my
morning
work
my
heart
elate
with
lofty
hope
and
high
resolve
how
easy
and
simple
it
seemed
to
lead
a
life
without
fear
or
reproach
or
or
any
sordid
hope
of
personal
reward
either
here
or
hereafter
a
life
of
stoical
endurance
invincible
patience
and
meekness
indomitable
cheerfulness
and
after
all
it
was
only
for
another
forty
or
fifty
years
at
the
most
and
what
was
that
and
after
that
the
thought
was
inspiring
indeed
by
and
luncheon
consisted
of
an
abernethy
biscuit
and
a
glass
of
water
and
several
pipes
of
shag
tobacco
cheap
and
rank
some
subtle
change
would
come
over
the
spirit
of
my
dream
other
people
did
not
have
high
resolves
some
people
had
very
bad
tempers
and
rubbed
one
very
much
the
wrong
way
what
a
hideous
place
was
pentonville
to
slave
away
one
life
in
what
a
grind
it
was
to
be
forever
making
designs
for
little
new
shops
in
rosoman
street
and
not
making
them
well
it
seemed
why
should
a
squinting
bowlegged
little
judkins
a
sight
to
make
a
shudder
forever
taunt
one
with
having
enlisted
as
a
private
soldier
and
then
why
should
one
be
sneeringly
told
to
hit
a
fellow
one
own
size
merely
because
provoked
beyond
endurance
one
just
grabbed
him
by
the
slack
of
his
trousers
and
gently
shook
him
out
of
them
onto
the
floor
terrified
but
quite
unhurt
and
so
on
and
so
on
constant
little
sordid
humiliations
ugliness
meannesses
and
dirt
that
called
forth
in
resistance
all
that
was
lowest
and
least
commendable
in
one
self
one
has
attuned
one
nerves
to
the
leading
of
a
forlorn
hope
and
a
gnat
gets
into
one
eye
or
a
little
cinder
grit
and
there
it
sticks
and
there
is
no
question
of
leading
any
forlorn
hope
after
all
and
never
will
be
all
was
in
the
imagination
only
it
is
always
gnats
and
cinder
grits
gnats
and
cinder
grits
by
the
evening
i
had
ignominiously
broken
down
and
was
plunged
in
the
depths
of
an
exasperated
pessimism
too
deep
even
for
tears
and
would
have
believed
myself
the
meanest
and
most
miserable
of
mankind
but
that
everybody
else
without
exception
was
even
meaner
and
miserabler
than
myself
they
could
still
eat
and
drink
and
be
merry
i
could
not
and
did
not
even
want
to
and
so
on
day
after
day
week
after
week
for
months
and
years
thus
i
grew
weary
in
time
of
my
palling
individuality
ever
the
same
through
all
these
uncontrollable
variations
of
mood
oh
that
alternate
ebb
and
flow
of
the
spirits
it
is
a
disease
and
what
is
most
distressing
it
is
no
real
change
it
is
more
sickeningly
monotonous
than
absolute
stagnation
itself
and
from
that
dreary
seesaw
i
could
never
escape
except
through
the
gates
of
dreamless
sleep
the
death
in
life
for
even
in
our
dreams
we
are
still
ourselves
there
was
no
rest
i
loathed
the
very
sight
of
myself
in
the
as
i
went
by
and
yet
i
always
looked
for
it
there
in
the
forlorn
hope
of
at
least
finding
some
alteration
even
for
the
worse
i
passionately
longed
to
be
somebody
else
and
yet
i
never
met
anybody
else
i
could
have
borne
to
be
for
a
moment
and
then
the
loneliness
of
us
each
separate
unit
of
our
helpless
race
is
inexorably
bounded
by
the
inner
surface
of
his
own
mental
periphery
a
jointless
armor
in
which
there
is
no
weak
place
never
a
fault
never
a
single
gap
of
egress
for
ourselves
of
ingress
for
the
nearest
and
dearest
of
our
at
only
five
points
can
we
just
touch
each
other
and
all
that
is
and
that
only
by
the
function
of
our
poor
senses
from
the
outside
in
vain
we
rack
them
that
we
may
get
a
little
closer
to
the
best
beloved
and
most
implicitly
trusted
ever
in
vain
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
why
should
so
fantastic
a
thought
have
persecuted
me
so
cruelly
i
knew
nobody
with
whom
i
should
have
felt
such
a
transfusion
of
soul
even
tolerable
for
a
second
i
can
not
tell
but
it
was
like
a
gadfly
which
drove
me
to
fatigue
my
body
that
i
should
have
by
day
the
stolid
peace
of
mind
that
comes
of
healthy
physical
exhaustion
that
i
should
sleep
at
night
the
dreamless
sleep
the
death
in
life
of
such
materials
wretched
men
are
made
especially
wretched
young
men
and
the
wretcheder
one
is
the
more
one
smokes
and
the
more
one
smokes
the
wretcheder
one
gets
a
vicious
circle
such
was
my
case
i
grew
to
long
for
the
hour
of
my
release
as
i
expressed
it
pathetically
to
myself
and
caressed
the
idea
of
suicide
i
even
composed
for
myself
a
little
rhymed
epitaph
in
french
which
i
thought
very
neat
je
point
je
fus
je
ne
suis
plus
oh
to
perish
in
some
noble
cause
to
die
saving
another
life
even
another
worthless
life
to
which
he
clung
i
remember
formulating
this
wish
in
all
sincerity
one
moonlit
night
as
i
walked
up
frith
street
soho
i
came
upon
a
little
group
of
excited
people
gathered
together
at
the
foot
of
a
house
built
over
a
shop
from
a
broken
on
the
second
floor
an
ominous
cloud
of
smoke
rose
like
a
column
into
the
windless
sky
an
ordinary
ladder
was
placed
against
the
house
which
they
said
was
densely
inhabited
but
no
or
had
arrived
as
yet
and
it
appeared
useless
to
try
and
rouse
the
inmates
by
kicking
and
beating
at
the
door
any
longer
a
brave
man
was
wanted
a
very
brave
man
who
would
climb
the
ladder
and
make
his
way
into
the
house
through
the
broken
window
here
was
a
forlorn
hope
to
lead
at
last
such
a
man
was
found
to
my
lasting
shame
and
contrition
it
was
not
i
he
was
short
and
thick
and
and
had
a
very
jolly
red
face
and
immense
whiskers
quite
a
common
sort
of
man
who
seemed
by
no
means
tired
of
life
his
heroism
was
wasted
as
it
happened
for
the
house
was
an
empty
one
as
we
all
heard
to
our
immense
relief
before
he
had
managed
to
force
a
passage
into
the
burning
room
his
whiskers
were
not
even
singed
nevertheless
i
slunk
home
and
gave
up
all
thoughts
of
even
in
a
noble
cause
and
there
in
penance
i
somewhat
hastily
committed
to
flame
the
plodding
labor
of
many
midnights
an
elaborate
copy
in
pen
and
ink
line
for
line
of
immortal
der
tod
als

which
lintot
had
been
kind
enough
to
lend
me
and
under
which
i
had
written
in
beautiful
black
gothic
letters
and
red
capitals
and
without
the
slightest
sense
of
either
humor
or
irreverence
the
following
poem
which
had
cost
me
infinite
pains

in

three
illustration
i
had
no
friends
but
the
lintots
and
their
friends
les
amis
de
nos
amis

nos

my
cousin
alfred
had
gone
into
the
army
like
his
father
before
him
my
cousin
charlie
had
gone
into
the
church
and
we
had
drifted
completely
apart
my
grandmother
was
dead
my
aunt
plunket
a
great
invalid
lived
in
florence
her
daughter
madge
was
in
india
happily
married
to
a
young
soldier
who
is
now
a
most
distinguished
general
the
lintots
held
their
heads
high
as
representatives
of
a
liberal
profession
and
an
old
pentonville
family
people
were
generally
exclusive
in
those
days
an
exclusiveness
that
was
chiefly
kept
up
by
the
ladies
there
were
charmed
circles
even
in
pentonville
among
the
most
exclusive
were
the
lintots
let
us
hope
in
common
justice
that
those
they
excluded
were
at
least
able
to
exclude
others
i
have
eaten
their
bread
and
salt
and
it
would
ill
become
me
to
deny
that
their
circle
was
charming
as
well
as
charmed
but
i
had
no
gift
for
making
friends
although
i
was
often
attracted
by
people
the
very
opposite
of
myself
especially
by
little
clever
quick
but
not
too
familiar
men
but
even
if
they
were
disposed
to
make
advances
a
miserable
shyness
and
stiffness
of
manner
on
my
part
that
i
could
not
help
would
raise
a
barrier
of
ice
between
us
they
were
most
hospitable
people
these
good
lintots
and
had
many
friends
and
gave
many
parties
which
my
miserable
shyness
prevented
me
from
enjoying
to
the
full
they
were
both
too
stiff
and
too
free
in
the
lintot
and
one
or
two
other
ladies
severely
dressed
would
play
the
severest
music
in
a
manner
that
did
not
mitigate
its
severity
they
were
merciless
it
was
nearly
always
bach
or
hummel
or
scarlatti
each
of
whom
they
would
say
could
write
both
like
an
artist
and
a
gentleman
a
very
rare
but
indispensable
combination
it
seemed
other
ladies
young
and
and
a
few
youths
like
myself
would
be
suffered
to
listen
but
never
to
retaliate
never
to
play
or
sing
back
again
if
one
ventured
to
ask
for
a
song
without
words
by
mendelssohn
or
a
song
with
words
even
by
schubert
even
with
german
words
one
was
rebuked
and
made
to
blush
for
the
crime
of
musical
frivolity
meanwhile
in
lintot
office
built
by
himself
in
the
back
garden
grave
men
and
true
pending
the
supper
hour
would
smoke
and
sip
and
talk
shop
formally
at
first
and
with
much
politeness
but
gradually
feeling
their
way
as
it
were
they
would
relax
into
social
unbuttonment
and
drop
the
mister
before
each
other
names
to
be
resumed
next
morning
and
indulge
in
lively
professional
chaff
which
would
soon
become
personal
and
free
and
boisterous
a
kind
of
warfare
in
which
i
did
not
shine
for
lack
of
quickness
and
repartee
for
instance
they
would
ask
one
whether
one
would
rather
be
a
bigger
fool
than
one
looked
or
look
a
bigger
fool
than
one
was
and
whichever
way
one
answered
the
question
the
retort
would
be
that
that
was
impossible
amid
roars
of
laughter
from
all
but
one
illustration
so
that
i
would
take
a
middle
course
and
spend
most
of
the
evening
on
the
stairs
and
in
the
hall
and
study
with
an
absorbing
interest
much
too
well
feigned
to
look
natural
the
photographs
of
famous
cathedrals
and
public
buildings
till
supper
came
when
by
assiduously
attending
on
the
ladies
i
would
cause
my
miserable
existence
to
be
remembered
and
forgiven
and
soon
forgotten
again
i
fear
i
hope
i
shall
not
be
considered
an
overweening
coxcomb
for
saying
that
on
the
whole
i
found
more
favor
with
the
ladies
than
with
the
gentlemen
especially
at
after
supper
there
would
be
a
change
for
the
better
some
thought
lintot
emboldened
by
and
would
become
unduly
immensely
uproariously
funny
in
spite
of
his
wife
he
had
a
genuine
gift
of
buffoonery
his
friends
would
whisper
to
each
other
that
lintot
was
on
and
encourage
him
bach
and
hummel
and
scarlatti
were
put
on
the
shelf
and
the
young
people
would
have
a
good
time
there
were
comic
songs
and
negro
melodies
with
a
chorus
all
round
lintot
would
sing
vilikins
and
his
dinah
in
the
manner
of
robson
so
well
that
even
lintot
stern
mask
would
relax
into
indulgent
smiles
it
was
irresistible
and
when
the
party
broke
up
we
could
all
thanks
to
our
host
honestly
thank
our
hostess
for
a
very
pleasant
evening
and
cheerfully
yet
almost
regretfully
wish
her
it
is
good
to
laugh
sometimes
wisely
if
one
can
if
not
there
are
seasons
when
even
the
crackling
of
thorns
under
a
pot
has
its
uses
it
seems
to
warm
the
pot
all
the
pots
and
all
the
emptiness
thereof
if
they
be
empty
once
indeed
i
actually
made
a
friend
but
he
did
not
last
me
very
long
it
happened
thus
lintot
gave
a
grander
party
than
usual
one
of
the
invited
was
moses
lyon
the
great
a
client
of
lintot
and
he
brought
with
him
young
raphael
merridew
the
already
famous
painter
the
most
attractive
youth
i
had
ever
seen
small
and
slight
but
beautifully
made
and
dressed
in
the
extreme
of
fashion
with
a
handsome
face
bright
and
polite
manners
and
an
irresistible
voice
he
became
his
laurels
well
he
would
have
been
sufficiently
dazzling
without
them
never
had
those
hospitable
doors
in
myddelton
square
been
opened
to
so
brilliant
a
guest
i
was
introduced
to
him
and
he
discovered
that
the
bridge
of
my
nose
was
just
suited
for
the
face
of
the
in
his
picture
of
the
and
the
and
begged
i
would
favor
him
with
a
sitting
or
two
proud
indeed
was
i
to
accede
to
such
a
request
and
i
gave
him
many
sittings
i
used
to
rise
at
dawn
to
sit
before
my
work
at
began
and
to
sit
again
as
soon
as
i
could
be
spared
it
seems
i
not
only
had
the
nose
and
brow
of
a
who
is
not
supposed
to
be
a
very
intellectual
person
but
also
his
arms
and
his
torso
and
sat
for
these
too
i
have
been
vain
of
myself
ever
since
during
these
sittings
which
he
made
delightful
i
grew
to
love
him
as
david
loved
jonathan
we
settled
that
we
would
go
to
the
derby
together
in
a
hansom
i
engaged
the
smartest
hansom
in
london
days
beforehand
on
the
great
wednesday
morning
i
was
punctual
with
it
at
his
door
in
charlotte
street
there
was
another
hansom
there
already
a
smarter
hansom
still
than
mine
for
it
was
a
private
one
and
he
came
down
and
told
me
he
had
altered
his
mind
and
was
going
with
lyon
who
had
asked
him
the
evening
before
one
of
the
first
in
london
my
dear
fellow
hang
it
all
you
know
i
could
refuse
awfully
sorry
so
i
drove
to
the
derby
in
solitary
splendor
but
the
bright
weather
the
humors
of
the
road
all
the
gay
scenes
were
thrown
away
upon
me
such
was
the
bitterness
of
my
heart
illustration
in
the
early
afternoon
i
saw
merridew
lunching
on
the
top
of
a
drag
among
some
men
of
smart
and
aristocratic
appearance
he
seemed
to
be
the
life
of
the
party
and
gave
me
a
nod
as
i
passed
i
soon
found
lyon
sitting
disconsolate
in
his
hansom
scowling
and
solitary
he
invited
me
to
lunch
with
him
and
disembosomed
himself
of
a
load
of
bitterness
as
intense
as
mine
which
i
kept
to
myself
the
shrewd
hebrew
tradesman
was
sunk
in
the
injured
friend
merridew
had
left
lyon
for
the
earl
of
chiselhurst
just
as
he
had
left
me
for
lyon
that
was
a
dull
derby
for
us
both
a
few
days
later
i
met
merridew
radiant
as
ever
all
he
said
was
awful
shame
of
me
to
drop
old
lyon
for
chiselhurst
eh
but
an
earl
my
dear
fellow
hang
it
all
you
know
poor
old
mo
had
to
get
back
in
his
hansom
all
by
himself
but
he
bought
the
all
the
same
merridew
soon
dropped
me
altogether
to
my
great
sorrow
for
i
forgave
him
his
derby
desertion
as
quickly
as
lyon
did
and
would
have
forgiven
him
anything
he
was
one
of
those
for
whom
allowances
are
always
being
made
and
with
a
good
grace
he
died
before
he
was
thirty
poor
boy
but
his
fame
will
never
die
the
even
with
the
bridge
of
that
nose
which
had
been
so
wofully
put
out
of
joint
is
enough
by
itself
to
place
him
among
the
immortals
lyon
sold
it
to
lord
chiselhurst
for
three
thousand
pounds
it
had
cost
him
five
hundred
it
is
now
in
the
national
gallery
illustration
poetical
justice
was
satisfied
nor
was
i
more
fortunate
in
love
than
in
friendship
all
the
exclusiveness
in
the
world
can
not
exclude
good
and
beautiful
maidens
and
these
were
not
lacking
even
in
pentonville
there
is
always
one
maiden
much
more
beautiful
and
good
than
all
the
others
like
esmeralda
among
the
ladies
of
the
hôtel
de
gondelaurier
there
was
such
a
maiden
in
pentonville
or
rather
clerkenwell
close
by
but
her
station
was
so
humble
like
esmeralda
that
even
the
least
exclusive
would
have
drawn
the
line
at
she
was
one
of
a
large
family
and
they
sold
tripe
and
pig
feet
and
food
for
cats
and
dogs
in
a
very
small
shop
opposite
the
western
wall
of
the
middlesex
house
of
detention
she
was
the
eldest
and
the
busy
responsible
one
at
this
poor
counter
she
was
one
of
nature
ladies
one
of
goddesses
a
queen
of
that
i
felt
sure
every
time
i
passed
her
shop
and
shyly
met
her
kind
frank
uncoquettish
gaze
a
time
was
approaching
when
i
should
have
to
overcome
my
shyness
and
tell
her
that
she
of
all
women
was
the
woman
for
me
and
that
it
was
indispensable
absolutely
indispensable
that
we
two
should
be
made
one
immediately
at
once
forever
but
before
i
could
bring
myself
to
this
she
married
somebody
else
and
we
had
never
exchanged
a
single
word
if
she
is
alive
now
she
is
an
old
woman
a
good
and
beautiful
old
woman
i
feel
sure
wherever
she
is
and
whatever
her
rank
in
life
if
she
should
read
this
book
which
is
not
very
likely
may
she
accept
this
small
tribute
from
an
unknown
admirer
for
whom
so
many
years
ago
she
beautified
and
made
poetical
the
hideous
street
that
still
bounds
the
middlesex
house
of
detention
on
its
western
side
and
may
she
try
to
think
not
the
less
of
it
because
since
then
its
writer
has
been
on
the
wrong
side
of
that
long
blank
wall
of
that
dreary
portal
where
the
agonized
stone
face
looks
down
on
the
desolate
slum
me
si
va
tra
la
perduta
after
this
disappointment
i
got
myself
a
big
dog
like
byron
bismarck
and
wagner
but
not
in
the
spirit
of
emulation
indeed
i
had
never
heard
of
either
bismarck
or
wagner
in
those
days
or
their
dogs
and
i
had
lost
my
passion
for
byron
and
any
wish
to
emulate
him
in
any
way
it
was
simply
for
the
want
of
something
to
be
fond
of
and
that
would
be
sure
to
love
me
back
again
he
was
not
a
big
dog
when
i
bought
him
but
just
a
little
ball
of
fluff
that
i
could
carry
with
one
arm
he
cost
me
all
the
money
i
had
saved
up
for
a
holiday
trip
to
passy
i
had
seen
his
father
a
champion
bernard
at
a
and
felt
that
life
would
be
well
worth
living
with
such
a
companion
but
price
was
five
hundred
guineas
when
i
saw
the
irresistible
son
just
six
weeks
old
and
heard
that
he
was
only
of
his
sire
value
i
felt
passy
must
wait
and
became
his
possessor
illustration
porthos
and
his
attendant
squire
i
gave
him
of
the
best
that
money
could
buy
real
milk
at
fivepence
a
quart
three
quarts
a
day
i
combed
his
fluff
every
morning
and
washed
him
three
times
a
week
and
killed
all
his
fleas
one
by
one
a
labour
of
love
i
weighed
him
every
saturday
and
found
he
increased
at
the
rate
of
six
to
nine
weekly
and
his
power
of
affection
increased
as
the
square
of
his
weight
i
christened
him
porthos
because
he
was
so
big
and
fat
and
jolly
but
in
his
noble
puppy
face
and
his
beautiful
pathetic
eyes
i
already
foresaw
for
his
middle
age
that
distinguished
and
melancholy
grandeur
which
characterized
the
sublime
athos
comte
de
la
fère
he
was
a
joy
it
was
good
to
go
to
sleep
at
night
and
know
he
would
be
there
in
the
morning
whenever
we
took
our
walks
abroad
everybody
turned
round
to
look
at
him
and
admire
and
to
ask
if
he
was
and
what
his
particular
breed
was
and
what
i
fed
him
on
he
became
a
monster
in
size
a
beautiful
playful
gracefully
galumphing
and
most
affectionate
monster
and
i
his
happy
frankenstein
congratulated
myself
on
the
possession
of
a
treasure
that
would
last
twelve
years
at
least
or
even
fourteen
with
the
care
i
meant
to
take
of
him
but
he
died
of
distemper
when
he
was
eleven
months
old
i
do
not
know
if
little
dogs
cause
as
large
griefs
when
they
die
as
big
ones
but
i
settled
there
should
be
no
more
dogs
big
or
little
for
me
after
this
i
took
to
writing
verses
and
sending
them
to
magazines
where
they
never
appeared
they
were
generally
about
my
being
reminded
by
a
tune
of
things
that
had
happened
a
long
time
ago
my
poetic
like
my
artistic
vein
was
limited
here
are
the
last
i
made
thirty
years
back
my
only
excuse
for
giving
them
is
that
they
are
so
the
reminding
tune
an
old
french
chime
which
my
father
used
to
sing
is
very
simple
and
touching
and
the
old
french
words
run
thus
orléans
beaugency
notre
dame
de
cléry
vendôme
vendôme
quel
chagrin
quel
ennui
de
compter
toute
la
nuit
les
heures
les
heures
that
is
all
they
are
supposed
to
be
sung
by
a
mediaeval
prisoner
who
can
not
sleep
and
who
to
beguile
the
tediousness
of
his
insomnia
sets
any
words
that
come
into
his
head
to
the
tune
of
the
chime
which
marks
the
hours
from
a
neighboring
belfry
i
tried
to
fancy
that
his
name
was
pasquier
de
la
marière
and
that
he
was
my
ancestor
the
chime
is
an
old
french
air
a
little
song
of
loneliness
and
grief
simple
as
nature
sweet
beyond
compare
and
sad
past
all
belief
nameless
is
he
that
wrote
the
melody
but
this
i
opine
whoever
made
the
words
was
some
remote
french
ancestor
of
mine
i
know
the
dungeion
deep
where
long
he
lay
and
why
he
lay
therein
and
all
his
anguish
that
he
could
not
sleep
for
conscience
of
a
i
see
his
cold
hard
bed
i
hear
the
chimes
that
jingled
in
his
ears
as
he
pressed
nightly
with
that
wakeful
head
a
pillow
wet
with
tears
oh
restless
little
chime
it
never
changed
but
rang
its
roundelay
for
each
dark
hour
of
that
unhappy
time
that
sighed
itself
away
and
ever
more
and
more
its
burden
grew
of
his
lost
self
a
part
and
mingled
with
his
memories
and
wore
its
way
into
his
heart
and
there
it
wove
the
name
of
many
a
town
he
loved
for
one
dear
sake
into
its
web
of
music
thus
he
came
his
little
song
to
make
of
all
that
ever
heard
and
loved
it
for
its
sweetness
none
but
i
divined
the
clew
that
as
a
hidden
word
the
notes
doth
underlie
that
wail
from
lips
long
dead
has
found
its
echo
in
this
breast
alone
only
to
me
by
led
is
that
wild
story
known
and
though
is
mine
by
right
of
to
rifle
and
lay
bare
a
heritage
of
sorrow
and
delight
the
world
would
gladly
share
yet
must
i
not
unfold
for
evermore
nor
whisper
late
or
soon
the
secret
that
a
few
slight
bars
thus
hold
imprisoned
in
a
tune
for
when
that
little
song
goes
ringing
in
my
head
i
know
that
he
my
luckless
lone
forefather
dust
so
long
relives
his
life
in
me
i
sent
them
to
magazine
with
the
six
french
lines
on
at
the
which
they
were
founded
at
the
top
published
only
the
six
french
lines
the
only
lines
in
my
handwriting
that
ever
got
into
print
and
they
date
from
the
fifteenth
century
thus
was
my
little
song
lost
to
the
world
and
for
a
time
to
me
but
long
long
afterwards
i
found
it
again
where
longfellow
once
found
a
song
of
in
the
heart
of
a
friend
surely
the
sweetest
bourne
that
can
ever
be
for
any
song
little
did
i
foresee
that
a
day
was
not
far
off
when
real
blood
remembrance
would
carry
me
but
that
is
to
come
poetry
friendship
and
love
having
failed
i
sought
for
consolation
in
art
and
frequented
the
national
gallery
marlborough
house
where
the
vernon
collection
was
the
british
museum
the
royal
academy
and
other
exhibitions
i
prostrated
myself
before
titian
rembrandt
velasquez
veronese
da
vinci
botticelli
signorelli
the
older
the
better
and
tried
my
best
to
honestly
feel
the
greatness
i
knew
and
know
to
be
there
but
for
want
of
proper
training
i
was
unable
to
reach
those
heights
and
like
most
outsiders
admired
them
for
the
wrong
things
for
the
very
beauties
they
lack
such
transcendent
ineffable
beauties
of
feature
form
and
expression
as
an
outsider
always
looks
for
in
an
old
master
and
often
persuades
himself
he
finds
there
and
oftener
still
he
does
i
was
far
more
sincerely
moved
although
i
did
not
dare
to
say
so
by
some
works
of
our
own
time
for
instance
by
the
vale
of
rest
the
autumn
leaves
the
huguenot
of
young
millais
just
as
i
found
such
poems
as
and
by
alfred
tennyson
infinitely
more
precious
and
dear
to
me
than
milton
and
spenser
indeed
i
was
hopelessly
modern
in
those
days
quite
an
young
man
the
names
i
held
in
the
warmest
and
deepest
regard
were
those
of
then
living
men
and
women
darwin
browning
and
george
eliot
did
not
it
is
true
exist
for
me
as
yet
but
tennyson
thackeray
dickens
millais
john
leech
george
sand
balzac
the
old
dumas
victor
hugo
and
alfred
de
musset
i
have
never
beheld
them
in
the
flesh
but
like
all
the
world
i
know
their
outer
aspect
well
and
could
stand
a
pretty
stiff
examination
in
most
they
have
ever
written
drawn
or
painted
other
stars
of
magnitude
have
risen
since
but
of
the
old
galaxy
four
at
least
still
shine
out
of
the
past
with
their
ancient
lustre
undimmed
in
my
eyes
thackeray
dear
john
leech
who
still
has
power
to
make
me
laugh
as
i
like
to
laugh
and
for
the
two
others
it
is
plain
that
the
queen
the
world
and
i
are
of
a
like
mind
as
to
their
deserts
for
one
of
them
is
now
an
ornament
to
the
british
peerage
the
other
a
baronet
and
a
millionaire
only
i
would
have
made
dukes
of
them
straight
off
with
precedence
over
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
if
they
would
care
to
have
it
so
it
is
with
a
full
but
humble
heart
that
i
thus
venture
to
record
my
long
indebtedness
and
pay
this
poor
tribute
still
fresh
from
the
days
of
my
unquestioning
it
will
serve
at
least
to
show
my
reader
should
i
ever
have
one
sufficiently
interested
to
care
in
what
mental
latitudes
and
longitudes
i
dwelt
who
was
destined
to
such
singular
experience
a
kind
of
reference
so
to
speak
that
he
may
be
able
to
place
me
at
a
glance
according
to
the
estimation
in
which
he
holds
these
famous
and
perhaps
deathless
names
it
will
be
admitted
at
least
that
my
tastes
were
normal
and
shared
by
a
large
majority
the
tastes
of
an
young
man
at
that
particular
period
of
the
nineteenth
century
one
much
given
to
athletics
and
cold
tubs
and
light
reading
and
cheap
tobacco
and
endowed
with
the
usual
discontent
the
last
person
for
whom
or
from
whom
or
by
whom
to
expect
anything
out
of
the
common
but
the
splendor
of
the
elgin
marbles
i
understood
that
at
once
perhaps
because
there
is
not
so
much
to
understand
mere
physically
beautiful
people
appeal
to
us
all
whether
they
be
in
flesh
or
marble
by
some
strange
intuition
or
natural
instinct
i
that
people
ought
to
be
built
like
that
before
i
had
ever
seen
a
single
statue
in
that
wondrous
room
i
had
divined
them
so
completely
did
they
realize
an
aesthetic
ideal
i
had
always
felt
i
had
often
as
i
walked
the
london
streets
peopled
an
imaginary
world
of
my
own
with
a
few
hundreds
of
such
beings
made
flesh
and
blood
and
pictured
them
as
a
kind
of
beneficent
aristocracy
seven
feet
high
with
minds
and
manners
to
match
their
physique
and
set
above
the
rest
of
the
world
for
its
good
for
i
found
it
necessary
so
that
my
dream
should
have
a
point
to
provide
them
with
a
foil
in
the
shape
of
millions
of
such
people
as
we
meet
every
day
i
was
egotistic
and
enough
it
is
true
to
enroll
myself
among
the
former
and
had
chosen
for
my
particular
use
and
wear
just
such
a
frame
as
that
of
the
theseus
with
of
course
the
nose
and
hands
and
feet
of
which
time
has
bereft
him
restored
and
all
mutilations
made
good
and
for
my
mistress
and
companion
i
had
duly
selected
no
less
a
person
than
the
venus
of
milo
no
longer
armless
of
which
lintot
possessed
a
and
whose
beauties
i
had
foreseen
before
i
ever
beheld
them
with
the
bodily
eye
monsieur
pas
dégoûté
as
ibbetson
would
have
remarked
but
most
of
all
did
i
pant
for
the
music
which
is
divine
alas
that
concerts
and
operas
and
oratorios
should
not
be
as
free
to
the
impecunious
as
the
national
gallery
and
the
british
museum
a
privilege
which
is
not
abused
impecunious
as
i
was
i
sometimes
had
pence
enough
to
satisfy
this
craving
and
discovered
in
time
such
realms
of
joy
as
i
had
never
dreamed
of
such
monarchs
as
mozart
handel
and
beethoven
and
others
of
whom
my
father
knew
apparently
so
little
and
yet
they
were
more
potent
enchanters
than
grétry
hérold
and
boieldieu
whose
music
he
sang
so
well
i
discovered
moreover
that
they
could
do
more
than
charm
they
could
drive
my
weary
self
out
of
my
weary
soul
and
for
a
space
fill
that
weary
soul
with
courage
resignation
and
hope
no
titian
no
shakespeare
no
phidias
could
ever
accomplish
that
not
even
william
makepeace
thackeray
or
alfred
tennyson
my
sweetest
recollections
of
this
period
of
my
life
indeed
the
only
sweet
recollections
are
of
the
music
i
heard
and
the
places
where
i
heard
it
it
was
an
enchantment
with
what
vividness
i
can
recall
it
all
the
eager
anticipation
for
days
the
careful
selection
beforehand
from
such
an
de
as
was
duly
advertised
then
the
long
waiting
in
the
street
at
the
doors
reserved
for
those
whose
portion
is
to
be
the
gallery
the
seat
aloft
is
reached
at
last
after
a
selfish
but
struggle
up
the
long
stone
staircase
one
is
sorry
for
the
weak
but
a
famished
ear
has
no
conscience
the
gay
and
splendid
house
is
crammed
the
huge
chandelier
is
a
golden
blaze
the
delight
of
expectation
is
in
the
air
and
also
the
scent
of
gas
and
peppermint
and
and
humanity
whom
i
have
discovered
to
be
of
sweeter
fragrance
than
the
common
herd
illustration
the
orchestra
fills
one
by
one
instruments
tune
up
a
familiar
cacophony
sweet
with
seductive
promise
the
conductor
takes
his
seat
applause
a
hush
three
taps
the
baton
waves
once
twice
thrice
the
eternal
fountain
of
magic
is
let
loose
and
at
the
very
first
jet
cares
that
infest
the
day
shall
fold
their
tents
like
the
arabs
and
as
silently
steal
then
lo
the
curtain
rises
and
straightway
we
are
in
seville
seville
after
pentonville
count
lordly
gallant
and
gay
beneath
his
disguise
twangs
his
guitar
and
what
sounds
issue
from
it
for
every
instrument
that
was
ever
invented
is
in
that
guitar
the
whole
orchestra
ridente
il
so
sings
he
with
the
most
beautiful
male
voice
of
his
time
under
rosina
balcony
and
soon
rosina
voice
the
most
beautiful
female
voice
of
hers
is
heard
behind
her
curtains
so
girlish
so
innocent
so
young
and
that
the
eyes
fill
with
involuntary
tears
thus
encouraged
he
warbles
that
his
name
is
lindoro
that
he
would
fain
espouse
her
that
he
is
not
rich
in
the
goods
of
this
world
but
gifted
with
an
inordinate
inexhaustible
capacity
for
love
just
like
peter
ibbetson
and
vows
that
he
will
always
warble
to
her
in
this
wise
from
dawn
till
when
daylight
sinks
behind
the
mountain
but
what
matter
the
words
go
on
my
love
go
on
warbles
back
rosina
and
no
wonder
till
the
dull
despondent
commonplace
heart
of
peter
ibbetson
has
room
for
nothing
else
but
sunny
hope
and
love
and
joy
and
yet
it
is
all
mere
sound
impossible
unnatural
unreal
nonsense
or
else
in
a
square
building
decent
and
enough
but
not
otherwise
remarkable
the
very
chapel
of
music
four
gentlemen
in
modern
attire
and
spectacles
take
their
places
on
an
unpretentious
platform
amid
refined
applause
and
soon
the
still
air
vibrates
to
the
trembling
of
sixteen
strings
only
that
and
nothing
more
but
in
that
is
all
beethoven
or
schubert
or
schumann
has
got
to
say
to
us
for
the
moment
and
what
a
say
it
is
and
with
what
consummate
precision
and
perfection
it
is
said
with
what
a
mathematical
certainty
and
yet
with
what
suavity
dignity
grace
and
distinction
they
are
the
four
greatest
players
in
the
world
perhaps
but
they
forget
themselves
and
we
forget
them
as
it
is
their
wish
we
should
in
the
master
whose
work
they
interpret
so
reverently
that
we
may
yearn
with
his
mighty
desire
and
thrill
with
his
rapture
and
triumph
or
ache
with
his
heavenly
pain
and
submit
with
his
divine
resignation
not
all
the
words
in
all
the
tongues
that
ever
were
dovetail
them
rhyme
them
alliterate
them
torture
them
as
you
will
can
ever
pierce
to
the
uttermost
depths
of
the
soul
of
man
and
let
in
a
glimpse
of
the
infinite
as
do
the
inarticulate
tremblings
of
those
sixteen
strings
ah
songs
without
words
are
the
best
then
a
little
individual
wiry
and
unkempt
who
looks
as
if
he
had
spent
his
life
listening
to
the
voices
of
the
night
in
heaven
knows
what
lithuanian
forests
with
wolves
and
for
his
familiars
and
the
wind
in
the
trees
for
his
teacher
seats
himself
at
the
great
oaken
broadwood
and
under
his
phenomenal
fingers
a
haunting
tender
full
of
questionings
a
dark
mystery
of
moonless
starlit
nature
exhales
itself
in
nocturnes
in
impromptus
in
preludes
in
mere
waltzes
and
mazourkas
even
but
waltzes
and
mazourkas
such
as
the
most
frivolous
would
never
dream
of
dancing
to
a
capricious
charming
sorrow
not
too
deep
for
tears
if
one
be
at
all
inclined
to
shed
them
so
delicate
so
fresh
and
yet
so
distinguished
so
ethereally
civilized
and
worldly
and
that
it
has
crystallized
itself
into
a
ecstasy
to
last
forever
it
seems
as
though
what
was
death
or
rather
euthanasia
to
him
who
felt
it
is
play
for
us
surely
an
immortal
sorrow
whose
recital
will
never
never
pall
the
sorrow
of
chopin
though
why
chopin
should
have
been
so
sorry
we
can
not
even
guess
for
mere
sorrow
sake
perhaps
the
very
luxury
of
woe
the
real
sorrow
which
has
no
real
cause
like
mine
in
those
days
and
that
is
the
best
and
cheapest
kind
of
sorrow
to
make
music
of
after
all
and
this
great
little
gypsy
pianist
who
plays
his
chopin
so
well
evidently
he
has
not
spent
his
life
in
lithuanian
forests
but
hard
at
the
night
and
day
and
he
has
had
a
better
master
than
the
wind
in
the
trees
namely
chopin
himself
for
it
is
printed
in
the
programme
it
was
his
father
and
mother
before
him
and
theirs
who
heard
the
voices
of
the
night
but
he
remembers
it
all
and
puts
it
all
into
his
master
music
and
makes
us
remember
it
too
or
else
behold
the
chorus
rising
tier
upon
tier
and
culminating
in
the
giant
organ
but
their
thunder
is
just
hushed
some
liliputian
figure
male
or
female
as
the
case
may
be
rises
on
its
little
legs
amid
the
great
liliputian
throng
and
through
the
sacred
stillness
there
peals
forth
a
perfect
voice
by
no
means
liliputian
it
bids
us
rest
in
the
lord
or
else
it
tells
us
that
he
was
despised
and
rejected
of
men
but
again
what
matter
the
words
they
are
almost
a
hinderance
beautiful
though
they
be
the
hardened
soul
melts
at
the
tones
of
the
singer
at
the
unspeakable
pathos
of
the
sounds
that
can
not
lie
one
almost
believes
one
believes
at
least
in
the
belief
of
others
at
last
one
understands
and
is
purged
of
intolerance
and
cynical
contempt
and
would
kneel
with
the
rest
in
sheer
human
sympathy
oh
wretched
outsider
that
one
is
if
it
all
be
true
one
whose
heart
so
hopelessly
impervious
to
the
written
word
so
helplessly
callous
to
the
spoken
message
can
be
reached
only
by
the
organized
vibrations
of
a
trained
larynx
a
metal
pipe
a
reed
a
by
invisible
impalpable
incomprehensible
little
in
mathematical
combination
that
beat
against
a
tiny
drum
at
the
back
of
one
ear
and
these
mathematical
combinations
and
the
laws
that
govern
them
have
existed
forever
before
moses
before
pan
long
before
either
a
larynx
or
a
tympanum
had
been
evolved
they
are
absolute
oh
mystery
of
mysteries
euterpe
muse
of
muses
what
a
personage
hast
thou
become
since
first
thou
sattest
for
thy
likeness
with
that
ridiculous
lyre
in
thy
untaught
hands
to
some
greek
who
could
carve
so
much
better
than
thou
couldst
play
four
strings
but
not
the
fingerable
strings
of
stradivarius
nay
i
beg
thy
pardon
five
for
thy
scale
was
pentatonic
i
believe
orpheus
himself
had
no
better
it
is
true
it
was
with
just
such
an
instrument
that
he
all
but
charmed
his
eurydice
out
of
hades
but
alas
she
went
back
on
second
thoughts
she
liked
hades
best
couldst
thou
fire
and
madden
and
wring
the
heart
and
then
melt
and
console
and
charm
it
into
the
peace
that
passeth
all
understanding
with
those
poor
five
rudimentary
notes
and
naught
between
couldst
thou
out
of
those
five
sounds
of
fixed
unalterable
pitch
make
not
a
sixth
sound
but
a
star
what
were
they
those
five
sounds
do
re
mi
fa
sol
what
must
thy
songs
without
words
have
been
if
thou
didst
ever
make
any
thou
wast
in
very
deed
a
miss
in
those
days
euterpe
for
all
that
thy
eight
twin
sisters
were
already
grown
up
and
out
and
now
thou
toppest
them
all
by
half
a
head
at
least
tu
leur
mangerais
des
petits
pâtés
sur
la
tête
comme
madame
seraskier
and
oh
how
thou
beatest
them
all
for
beauty
in
estimation
at
least
like
like
madame
seraskier
again
and
hast
thou
done
growing
at
last
nay
indeed
thou
art
not
even
yet
a
miss
thou
art
but
a
sweet
baby
one
year
old
and
seven
feet
high
tottering
midway
between
some
blessed
heaven
thou
hast
only
just
left
and
the
dull
home
of
us
poor
mortals
the
sweet
baby
of
our
kin
puts
its
hands
upon
our
knees
and
looks
up
into
our
eyes
with
eyes
full
of
unutterable
meaning
it
has
so
much
to
say
it
can
only
say
and
but
with
oh
how
searching
a
voice
how
touching
a
look
that
is
if
one
is
fond
of
babies
we
are
moved
to
the
very
core
we
want
to
understand
for
it
concerns
us
all
we
were
once
like
that
ourselves
the
individual
and
the
race
but
for
the
life
of
us
we
can
not
and
what
canst
say
to
us
yet
euterpe
but
thy
and
thy
the
inarticulate
sweetness
whereof
we
feel
and
can
not
comprehend
but
how
beautiful
it
is
and
what
a
look
thou
hast
and
what
a
voice
that
is
if
one
is
fond
of
music

next

had
filled
me
with
such
emotion

delight
and
take
it
home
to
my
little
square
piano
and
try
to
finger
it
all
out
for
myself
but
i
had
begun
too
late
in
life
to
sit
longing
and
helpless
before
an
instrument
one
can
not
play
with
a
lovely
score
one
can
not
read
even
tantalus
was
spared
such
an
ordeal
as
that
it
seemed
hard
that
my
dear
father
and
mother
so
accomplished
in
music
themselves
should
not
even
have
taught
me
the
musical
notes
at
an
age
when
it
was
so
easy
to
learn
them
and
thus
have
made
me
free
of
that
of
sound
in
which
i
took
such
an
extraordinary
delight
and
might
have
achieved
distinction
perhaps
but
no
my
father
had
dedicated
me
to
the
goddess
of
science
from
before
my
very
birth

i
might
some
day
be

must
be

i
have
fallen
between
two
stools
and
thus
euterpe
absent
her
enchantment
would
pass
away
her
handwriting
was
before
me
but
i
had
not

still
more
potent
enchanter
than
even
handel
or
beethoven
or
schubert
there
was
a
certain
lord
cray
for
whom
lintot
had
built
some
cottages
in
hertfordshire
and
i
sometimes
went
there
to
superintend
the
workmen
when
the
cottages
were
finished
lord
cray
and
his
wife
a
very
charming
lady
came
to
see
them
and
were
much
pleased
with
all
that
had
been
done
and
also
seemed
to
be
much
interested
in
of
all
people
in
the
world
and
a
few
days
later
i
received
a
card
of
invitation
to
their
house
in
town
for
a
concert
at
first
i
felt
much
too
shy
to
go
but
lintot
insisted
that
it
was
my
duty
to
do
so
as
it
might
lead
to
business
so
that
when
the
night
came
i
screwed
up
my
courage
to
the
and
went
that
evening
was
all
enchantment
or
would
have
been
but
for
the
somewhat
painful
feeling
that
i
was
such
an
outsider
but
i
was
always
well
content
to
be
the
least
observed
of
all
observers
and
felt
happy
in
the
security
that
here
i
should
at
least
be
left
alone
that
no
perfect
stranger
would
attempt
to
put
me
at
my
ease
by
making
me
the
butt
of
his
friendly
and
familiar
banter
that
no
gartered
duke
or
belted
earl
i
have
no
doubt
they
were
as
plentiful
there
as
blackberries
though
they
did
not
wear
their
insignia
would
pat
me
on
the
back
and
ask
me
if
i
would
sooner
look
a
bigger
fool
than
i
was
or
be
a
bigger
fool
than
i
looked
i
have
not
found
a
repartee
for
that
insidious
question
yet
that
is
why
it
rankles
so
i
had
always
heard
that
the
english
were
a
stiff
people
there
seemed
to
be
no
stiffness
at
lady
cray
nor
was
there
any
facetiousness
it
put
one
at
one
ease
merely
to
look
at
them
they
were
mostly
big
and
strong
and
healthy
and
quiet
and
with
soft
and
voices
the
large
rooms
were
neither
hot
nor
cold
there
were
beautiful
pictures
on
the
walls
and
an
exquisite
scent
of
flowers
came
from
an
immense
conservatory
i
had
never
been
to
such
a
gathering
before
all
was
new
and
a
surprise
and
very
much
to
my
taste
i
confess
it
was
my
first
glimpse
of
society
and
last
but
one
there
were
crowds
of
people
but
no
crowd
everybody
seemed
to
know
everybody
else
quite
intimately
and
to
resume
conversations
begun
an
hour
ago
somewhere
else
presently
these
conversations
were
hushed
and
grisi
and
mario
sang
it
was
as
much
as
i
could
do
to
restrain
my
enthusiasm
and
delight
i
could
have
shouted
out
loud
i
could
almost
have
sung
myself
in
the
midst
of
the
applause
that
followed
that
heavenly
duet
a
lady
and
gentleman
came
into
the
room
and
at
the
sight
of
that
lady
a
new
interest
came
into
my
life
and
all
the
old
sensations
of
mute
pain
and
rapture
that
the
beauty
of
madame
seraskier
used
to
make
me
feel
as
a
child
were
revived
once
more
but
with
a
depth
and
intensity
in
comparison
that
were
as
a
strong
man
barytone
to
a
small
boy
treble
it
was
the
quick
sharp
cruel
blow
the
de
that
beauty
of
the
most
obvious
yet
subtle
consummate
and
order
can
deal
to
a
thoroughly
prepared
victim
and
what
a
thoroughly
prepared
victim
was
i
a
poor
shy
virginal
savage
uncas
the
son
of
chingachgook
astray
for
the
first
time
in
a
fashionable
london
a
chaste
mediaeval
knight
born
out
of
his
due
time
ascetic
both
from
reverence
and
disgust
to
whom
woman
in
the
abstract
was
the
one
religion
in
the
concrete
the
cause
of
fifty
disenchantments
a
day
a
lusty
pagan
stranded
in
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
whom
some
strange
inherited
instinct
had
planted
a
definite
complete
and
conception
of
what
the
shape
of
woman
should
be
from
the
way
the
hair
should
grow
on
her
brow
and
her
temples
and
the
nape
of
her
neck
down
to
the
very
rhythm
that
should
regulate
the
length
and
curve
and
position
of
every
single
individual
toe
and
who
had
found
to
his
pride
and
delight
that
his
preconceived
ideal
was
as
near
to
that
of
phidias
as
if
he
had
lived
in
the
time
of
pericles
and
aspasia
for
such
was
this
poor
scribe
and
such
he
had
been
from
a
child
until
this
beautiful
lady
first
swam
into
his
ken
she
was
so
tall
that
her
eyes
seemed
almost
on
a
level
with
mine
but
she
moved
with
the
alert
lightness
and
grace
of
a
small
person
her
thick
heavy
hair
was
of
a
dark
coppery
brown
her
complexion
clear
and
pale
her
eyebrows
and
eyelashes
black
her
eyes
a
light
bluish
gray
her
nose
was
short
and
sharp
and
rather
tilted
at
the
tip
and
her
red
mouth
large
and
very
mobile
and
here
deviating
from
my
preconceived
ideal
she
showed
me
how
tame
a
preconceived
ideal
can
be
her
perfect
head
was
small
and
round
her
long
thick
throat
two
slight
creases
went
parallel
to
make
what
french
sculptors
call
collier
de
vénus
the
skin
of
her
neck
was
like
a
white
camellia
and
slender
and
as
she
was
she
did
not
show
a
bone
she
was
that
beautiful
type
the
french
define
as
fausse
which
does
not
mean
a
false
thin
woman
she
seemed
both
thoughtful
and
mirthful
at
once
and
genial
as
i
had
never
seen
any
one
genial
before
a
person
to
confide
in
to
tell
all
one
troubles
to
without
even
an
introduction
when
she
laughed
she
showed
both
top
and
bottom
teeth
which
were
perfect
and
her
eyes
nearly
closed
so
that
they
could
no
longer
be
seen
for
the
thick
lashes
that
fringed
both
upper
and
under
eyelids
at
which
time
the
expression
of
her
face
was
so
keenly
cruelly
sweet
that
it
went
through
one
like
a
knife
and
then
the
laugh
would
suddenly
cease
her
full
lips
would
meet
and
her
eyes
beam
out
again
like
two
mild
gray
suns
benevolently
humorous
and
kindly
inquisitive
and
full
of
interest
in
everything
and
everybody
around
her
but
there
i
can
not
describe
her
any
more
than
one
can
describe
a
beautiful
tune
out
of
those
magnificent
orbs
kindness
kindness
kindness
was
shed
like
a
balm
and
after
a
while
by
chance
that
balm
was
shed
for
a
few
moments
on
me
to
my
sweet
but
terrible
confusion
then
i
saw
that
she
asked
my
hostess
who
i
was
and
received
the
answer
on
which
she
shed
her
balm
on
me
for
one
moment
more
and
dismissed
me
from
her
thoughts
madame
grisi
sang
again
desdemona
song
from
and
the
beautiful
lady
thanked
the
divine
singer
whom
she
seemed
to
know
quite
intimately
and
i
thought
her
thanks
italian
thanks
even
diviner
than
the
song
not
that
i
could
quite
understand
them
or
even
hear
them
well
i
was
too
far
but
she
thanked
with
eyes
and
hands
and
shoulders
slight
happy
movements
as
well
as
words
surely
the
sweetest
and
sincerest
words
ever
spoken
she
was
much
surrounded
and
made
up
to
evidently
a
person
of
great
importance
and
i
ventured
to
ask
another
shy
man
standing
in
my
corner
who
she
was
and
he
answered
the
duchess
of
towers
she
did
not
stay
long
and
when
she
departed
all
turned
dull
and
commonplace
that
had
seemed
so
bright
before
she
came
and
seeing
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
bid
my
hostess
and
thank
her
for
a
pleasant
evening
as
we
did
in
pentonville
i
got
myself
out
of
the
house
and
walked
back
to
my
lodgings
an
altered
man
i
should
probably
never
meet
that
lovely
young
duchess
again
and
certainly
never
know
her
but
her
shaft
had
gone
straight
and
true
into
my
very
heart
and
i
felt
how
well
barbed
it
was
beyond
all
possibility
of
its
ever
being
torn
out
of
that
blessed
wound
might
this
never
heal
might
it
bleed
on
forever
she
would
be
an
ideal
in
my
lonely
life
to
live
up
to
in
thought
and
word
and
deed
an
instinct
which
i
felt
to
be
infallible
told
me
she
was
as
good
as
she
was
fair
dowered
with
the
hate
of
hate
the
scorn
of
scorn
the
love
of
love
illustration
the
duchess
op
towers
and
just
as
madame
seraskier
image
was
fading
away
this
new
star
had
arisen
to
guide
me
by
its
light
though
seen
but
for
a
moment
breaking
once
through
a
parted
cloud
i
knew
in
which
portion
of
the
heavens
it
dwelt
and
shone
apart
among
the
fairest
constellations
and
ever
after
turned
my
face
that
way
nevermore
in
my
life
would
i
do
or
say
or
think
a
mean
thing
or
an
impure
or
an
unkind
one
if
i
could
help
it
next
day
as
we
walked
to
the
foundling
hospital
for
divine
service
lintot
severely
deigned
under
protest
as
it
were
to
me
on
the
adventures
of
the
evening
i
did
not
mention
the
duchess
of
towers
nor
was
i
able
to
describe
the
different
ladies
dresses
but
i
described
everything
else
in
a
manner
i
thought
calculated
to
interest
her
deeply
the
flowers
the
splendid
pictures
and
curtains
and
cabinets
the
beautiful
music
the
many
lords
and
ladies
gay
she
disapproved
of
them
all
existence
on
such
an
opulent
scale
was
unconducive
to
any
qualities
of
real
sterling
value
either
moral
or
intellectual
give
for
one
plain
living
and
high
thinking
she
asked
what
kind
of
supper
did
they
give
you
something
extremely
i
have
no
doubt
ortolans
nightingales
tongues
pearls
dissolved
in
wine
candor
obliged
me
to
confess
there
had
been
no
supper
or
that
if
there
had
i
had
managed
to
miss
it
i
suggested
that
perhaps
everybody
had
dined
late
and
all
the
pearls
i
told
her
were
on
the
ladies
necks
and
in
their
hair
and
not
feeling
hungry
i
could
not
wish
them
anywhere
else
and
the
nightingales
tongues
were
in
their
throats
to
sing
heavenly
italian
duets
with
and
they
call
that
hospitality
exclaimed
lintot
who
loved
his
supper
and
then
as
he
was
fond
of
summing
up
and
laying
down
the
law
when
once
his
wife
had
given
him
the
lead
he
did
so
to
the
effect
that
though
the
great
were
all
very
well
in
their
superficial
way
and
might
possess
many
external
charms
for
each
other
and
for
all
who
were
so
deplorably
weak
as
to
fall
within
the
sphere
of
their
attraction
there
was
a
gulf
between
the
likes
of
them
and
the
likes
of
us
which
it
would
be
better
not
to
try
and
bridge
if
one
wished
to
preserve
independence
and
one
unless
of
course
it
led
to
business
and
this
he
feared
it
would
never
do
with
me
they
take
you
up
one
day
and
they
drop
you
like
a
potato
the
next
and
moreover
my
dear
peter
he
concluded
affectionately
linking
his
arm
in
mine
as
was
often
his
way
when
we
walked
together
although
he
was
twelve
good
inches
shorter
than
myself
inequality
of
social
condition
is
a
bar
to
any
real
intimacy
it
is
something
like
disparity
of
physical
stature
one
can
walk
arm
in
arm
only
with
a
man
of
about
one
own
size
this
summing
up
seemed
so
judicious
so
incontrovertible
that
feeling
quite
deplorably
weak
enough
to
fall
within
the
sphere
of
lady
attraction
if
i
saw
much
of
her
and
thereby
losing
my
i
was
deplorably
weak
enough
not
to
leave
a
card
on
her
after
the
happy
evening
i
had
spent
at
her
house
snob
that
i
was
i
dropped
her
like
a
potato
for
fear
of
her
dropping
me
besides
which
i
had
on
my
conscience
a
guilty
snobby
feeling
that
in
merely
external
charms
at
least
these
fine
people
were
more
to
my
taste
than
the
charmed
circle
of
my
kind
old
friends
the
lintots
however
inferior
they
might
be
to
these
for
all
that
i
knew
in
sterling
qualities
of
the
heart
and
head
just
as
i
found
the
outer
aspect
of
park
lane
and
piccadilly
more
attractive
than
that
of
pentonville
though
possibly
the
latter
may
have
been
the
more
wholesome
for
such
as
i
to
live
in
but
people
who
can
get
mario
and
grisi
to
come
and
sing
for
them
and
the
duchess
of
towers
to
come
and
listen
people
whose
walls
are
covered
with
beautiful
pictures
people
for
whom
the
smooth
and
harmonious
ordering
of
all
the
little
external
things
of
social
life
has
become
a
habit
and
a
profession
such
people
are
not
to
be
dropped
without
a
pang
so
with
a
pang
i
went
back
to
my
usual
round
as
though
nothing
had
happened
but
night
and
day
the
face
of
the
duchess
of
towers
was
ever
present
to
me
like
a
fixed
idea
that
dominates
a
life
on
reading
and
rereading
these
past
pages
i
find
that
i
have
been
unpardonably
egotistic
unconscionably
prolix
and
diffuse
and
with
such
small
beer
to
chronicle
and
yet
i
feel
that
if
i
strike
out
this
i
must
also
strike
out
that
which
would
lead
to
my
striking
out
all
in
sheer
discouragement
and
i
have
a
tale
to
tell
which
is
more
than
worth
the
telling
once
having
got
into
the
way
of
it
i
suppose
i
must
have
found
the
temptation
to
talk
about
myself
irresistible
it
is
evidently
a
habit
easy
to
acquire
even
in
old
age
perhaps
especially
in
old
age
for
it
has
never
been
my
habit
through
life
i
would
sooner
have
talked
to
you
about
yourself
reader
or
about
you
to
somebody
else
your
friend
or
even
your
enemy
or
about
them
to
you
but
indeed
at
present
and
until
i
die
i
am
without
a
soul
to
talk
to
about
anybody
or
anything
worth
speaking
of
so
that
most
of
my
talking
is
done
in
pen
and
ink
a
conversation
o
patient
reader
with
yourself
i
am
the
most
lonely
old
man
in
the
world
although
perhaps
the
happiest
still
it
is
not
always
amusing
where
i
live
cheerfully
awaiting
my
translation
to
another
sphere
there
is
the
good
chaplain
it
is
true
and
the
good
priest
who
talk
to
me
about
myself
a
little
too
much
methinks
and
the
doctor
who
talks
to
me
about
the
priest
and
the
chaplain
which
is
better
he
does
not
seem
to
like
them
he
is
a
very
witty
man
but
my
brother
maniacs
they
are
lamentably
tout
le
after
all
they
are
only
interesting
when
the
mad
fit
seizes
them
when
free
from
their
awful
complaint
they
are
for
the
most
part
very
common
mortals
conventional
philistines
dull
dogs
like
myself
and
dull
dogs
do
not
like
each
other
two
of
the
most
sensible
one
a
forger
the
other
a
kleptomaniac
on
an
important
scale
are
friends
of
mine
they
are
fairly
well
educated
respectable
city
men
clean
solemn
stodgy
punctilious
and
resigned
but
they
are
both
unhappy
not
because
they
are
cursed
with
the
double
brand
of
madness
and
crime
and
have
forfeited
their
freedom
in
consequence
but
because
they
find
there
are
so
few
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
a
criminal
lunatic
asylum
and
they
have
always
been
used
to
the
society
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
were
it
not
for
this
they
would
be
well
content
to
live
here
and
each
is
in
the
habit
of
confiding
to
me
that
he
considers
the
other
a
very
trustworthy
fellow
and
all
that
but
not
altogether
quite
a
gentleman
i
do
not
know
what
they
consider
me
they
probably
confide
that
to
each
other
can
anything
be
less
odd
less
eccentric
or
interesting
another
when
quite
sane
speaks
english
with
a
french
accent
and
demonstrative
french
gestures
and
laments
the
lost
glories
of
the
old
french
régime
and
affects
to
forget
the
simplest
english
words
he
does
know
a
word
of
french
however
but
when
his
madness
comes
on
and
he
is
put
into
a
all
his
english
comes
back
and
very
strong
fluent
idiomatic
english
it
is
of
the
cockneyest
kind
with
all
its
h
duly
transposed
another
the
most
unpleasant
and
ugliest
person
here
has
chosen
me
for
the
confidant
of
his
past
amours
he
gives
me
the
names
and
dates
and
all
the
less
i
listen
the
more
he
confides
he
makes
me
sick
what
can
i
do
to
prevent
his
believing
that
i
believe
him
i
am
tired
of
killing
people
for
lying
about
women
if
i
call
him
a
liar
and
a
cad
it
may
wake
in
him
heaven
knows
what
dormant
frenzy
for
i
am
quite
in
the
dark
as
to
the
nature
of
his
mental
infirmity
another
a
weak
but
amiable
and
youth
tries
to
think
that
he
is
passionately
fond
of
music
but
he
is
so
exclusive
if
you
please
that
he
can
only
endure
bach
and
beethoven
and
when
he
hears
mendelssohn
or
chopin
is
obliged
to
leave
the
room
if
i
want
to
please
him
i
whistle
le
bon
roi
dagobert
and
tell
him
it
is
the
of
one
of
bach
fugues
and
to
get
rid
of
him
i
whistle
it
again
and
tell
him
it
is
one
of
chopin
impromptus
what
his
madness
is
i
can
never
be
quite
sure
for
he
is
very
close
but
have
heard
that
he
is
fond
of
roasting
cats
alive
and
that
the
mere
sight
of
a
cat
is
enough
to
rouse
his
terrible
propensity
and
drive
all
wholesome
innocent
harmless
natural
affectation
out
of
his
head
there
is
a
painter
here
who
like
others
one
has
met
outside
believes
himself
the
one
living
painter
worthy
of
the
name
indeed
he
has
forgotten
the
names
of
all
the
others
and
can
only
despise
and
abuse
them
in
the
lump
he
triumphantly
shows
you
his
own
work
which
consists
of
just
the
kind
of
crude
irresponsible
impressionist
daubs
you
would
expect
from
an
amateur
who
talks
in
that
way
and
you
wonder
why
on
earth
he
should
be
in
a
lunatic
asylum
of
all
places
in
the
world
and
just
as
would
happen
outside
again
some
of
his
take
him
at
his
own
valuation
and
believe
him
a
great
genius
some
of
them
want
to
kick
him
for
an
impudent
impostor
but
that
he
is
so
small
and
the
majority
do
not
care
his
mania
is
arson
poor
fellow
and
when
the
terrible
wish
comes
over
him
to
set
the
place
on
fire
he
forgets
his
artistic
conceit
and
his
mean
weak
silly
face
becomes
almost
grand
and
with
the
female
inmates
it
is
just
the
same
there
is
a
lady
who
has
spent
twenty
years
of
her
life
here
her
father
was
a
small
country
doctor
called
snogget
her
husband
an
obscure
curate
and
she
is
absolutely
normal
and
even
vulgar
for
her
hobby
is
to
discourse
of
and
titled
people
and
county
families
with
whom
and
with
no
others
it
has
always
been
her
hope
and
desire
to
mix
and
is
still
though
her
hair
is
nearly
white
and
she
is
still
here
she
thinks
and
talks
and
cares
about
nothing
else
but
smart
people
and
has
conceived
a
very
warm
regard
for
me
on
account
of
ibbetson
of
ibbetson
hall
hopshire
not
because
i
killed
him
and
was
sentenced
to
be
hanged
for
it
or
because
he
was
a
greater
criminal
than
i
all
of
which
is
interesting
enough
but
because
he
was
my
relative
and
that
through
him
i
must
be
distantly
connected
she
thinks
with
the
ibbetsons
of
lechmere
whoever
they
may
be
and
whom
neither
she
nor
i
have
ever
met
indeed
i
had
never
heard
of
them
but
whose
family
history
she
knows
almost
by
heart
what
can
be
tamer
duller
more
prosaic
more
sordidly
humdrum
more
hopelessly
sane
more
characteristic
of
common
provincial
feminine
cackle
and
yet
this
woman
in
a
fit
of
conjugal
jealousy
murdered
her
own
children
and
her
father
went
mad
in
consequence
and
her
husband
cut
his
throat
in
fact
during
their
lucid
intervals
it
would
never
enter
one
mind
that
they
were
mad
at
all
they
are
so
absolutely
like
the
people
one
meets
every
day
in
the
world
such
idiots
such
deadly
bores
one
might
as
well
be
back
in
pentonville
or
hopshire
again
or
live
in
passionate
brompton
as
i
am
told
it
is
called
or
even
in
belgravia
for
that
matter
for
we
have
a
young
lord
and
a
baronet
a
shocking
pair
who
should
not
be
allowed
to
live
but
for
family
influence
they
would
be
doing
their
twenty
years
penal
servitude
in
jail
instead
of
living
comfortably
sequestered
here
like
ouida
heroes
they
stick
to
their
order
and
do
not
mingle
with
the
rest
of
us
they
ignore
us
so
completely
that
we
can
not
help
looking
up
to
them
in
spite
of
their
vices
just
as
we
should
do
outside
and
we
of
the
middle
class
we
stick
to
our
order
too
and
do
not
mingle
with
the
small
who
do
not
mingle
with
the
laborers
artisans
and
mechanics
who
alas
for
them
have
nobody
to
look
down
upon
but
each
other
but
they
do
not
and
are
the
people
in
the
place
such
are
we
it
is
only
when
our
madness
is
upon
us
that
we
cease
to
be
commonplace
and
wax
tragical
and
great
or
else
original
and
grotesque
and
humorous
with
that
true
deep
humor
that
compels
both
our
laughter
and
our
tears
and
leaves
us
older
sadder
and
wiser
than
it
found
us
lacrimae
rerum
et
mentem
mortalia
so
much
if
little
more
can
i
recall
of
the
benign
virgil
and
now
to
my
small
beer
again
which
will
have
more
of
a
head
to
it
henceforward
thus
did
i
pursue
my
solitary
way
like
bryant
only
with
a
less
definite
purpose
before
me
till
at
last
there
dawned
for
me
an
saturday
in
june
i
had
again
saved
up
enough
money
to
carry
my
long
journey
to
paris
into
execution
the
boiler
got
up
its
steam
the
white
awning
was
put
up
for
me
as
well
as
others
and
on
a
beautiful
cloudless
english
morning
i
stood
by
the
man
at
the
wheel
and
saw
paul
and
london
bridge
and
the
tower
fade
out
of
sight
with
what
hope
and
joy
i
can
not
describe
i
almost
forgot
that
i
was
me
and
next
morning
a
beautiful
french
morning
how
i
exulted
as
i
went
up
the
champs
elysées
and
passed
under
the
familiar
arc
de
triomphe
on
my
way
to
the
rue
de
la
pompe
passy
and
heard
all
around
the
familiar
tongue
that
i
still
knew
so
well
and
rebreathed
the
and
but
now
keenly
remembered
fragrance
of
the
that
vague
light
indescribable
almost
imperceptible
scent
of
a
place
that
is
so
heavenly
laden
with
the
past
for
those
who
have
lived
there
long
ago
the
most
subtly
intoxicating
ether
that
can
be
when
i
came
to
the
meeting
of
the
rue
de
la
tour
and
the
rue
de
la
pompe
and
looking
in
at
the
grocer
shop
at
the
corner
i
recognized
the
handsome
mustachioed
groceress
madame
liard
whose
mustache
twelve
prosperous
years
had
turned
gray
i
was
almost
faint
with
emotion
had
any
youth
been
ever
so
moved
by
that
face
before
there
behind
the
window
which
was
now
of
and
among
splendid
napoleonic
wares
of
a
later
day
were
the
same
old
balls
in
colored
the
same
quivering
lumps
of
fresh
paste
in
brown
paper
that
looked
so
cool
and
tempting
the
same
boxes
of
now
marked
centimes
of
which
i
had
consumed
so
many
in
the
service
of
mimsey
seraskier
i
went
in
and
bought
one
and
resmelt
with
delight
the
smell
of
all
my
dealings
there
and
received
her
familiar
sounding
merci
monsieur
autre
chose
as
if
it
had
been
a
blessing
but
i
was
too
shy
to
throw
myself
into
her
arms
and
tell
her
that
i
was
the
lone
wandering
but
not
lost
gogo
pasquier
she
might
have
said
eh
bien
et
après
the
day
had
begun
well
like
an
epicure
i
deliberated
whether
i
should
walk
to
the
old
gate
in
the
rue
de
la
pompe
and
up
the
avenue
and
back
to
our
old
garden
or
make
my
way
round
to
the
gap
in
the
park
hedge
that
we
had
worn
of
old
by
our
frequent
passage
in
and
out
to
and
from
the
bois
de
boulogne
i
chose
the
latter
as
on
the
whole
the
more
promising
in
exquisite
gradations
of
delight
the
gap
in
the
park
hedge
indeed
the
park
hedge
had
disappeared
the
very
park
itself
was
gone
cut
up
demolished
all
parcelled
out
into
small
gardens
with
trim
white
villas
except
where
a
railway
ran
through
a
deep
cutting
in
the
chalk
a
train
actually
roared
and
panted
by
and
choked
me
with
its
filthy
steam
as
i
looked
round
in
stupefaction
on
the
ruins
of
my
hope
if
that
train
had
run
over
me
and
i
had
survived
it
it
could
not
have
given
me
a
greater
shock
it
all
seemed
too
cruel
and
brutal
an
outrage
a
winding
had
been
pierced
through
the
very
heart
of
the
wilderness
and
on
this
little
gardens
abutted
and
in
these
i
would
recognize
here
and
there
an
old
friend
in
the
shape
of
some
tree
that
i
had
often
climbed
as
a
boy
and
which
had
been
left
standing
out
of
so
many
but
so
changed
by
the
loss
of
its
old
surroundings
that
it
had
a
tame
caged
transplanted
look
almost
apologetic
and
as
if
ashamed
of
being
found
out
at
last
nothing
else
remained
little
hills
and
cliffs
and
valleys
and
that
had
once
seemed
big
had
been
levelled
up
or
away
and
i
lost
my
bearings
altogether
and
felt
a
strange
creeping
chill
of
blankness
and
bereavement
but
how
about
the
avenue
and
my
old
home
i
hastened
back
to
the
rue
de
la
pompe
with
the
quick
step
of
aroused
anxiety
the
avenue
was
gone
blocked
within
a
dozen
yards
of
the
gate
by
a
huge
brick
building
covered
with
my
old
house
was
no
more
but
in
its
place
a
much
larger
and
smarter
edifice
of
sculptured
stone
the
old
gate
at
least
had
not
disappeared
nor
the
porter
lodge
and
i
feasted
my
sorrowful
eyes
on
these
poor
remains
that
looked
snubbed
and
shabby
and
out
of
place
in
the
midst
of
all
this
new
splendor
illustration
presently
a
smart
concierge
with
a
beautiful
pink
ribboned
cap
came
out
and
stared
at
me
for
a
while
and
inquired
if
monsieur
desired
anything
i
could
not
speak
que
monsieur
est
indisposé
cette
chaleur
monsieur
ne
parle
pas
le
français
when
i
found
my
tongue
i
explained
to
her
that
i
had
once
lived
there
in
a
modest
house
overlooking
the
street
but
which
had
been
replaced
by
this
much
more
palatial
abode
o
oui
monsieur
on
a
balayé
tout
ça
she
replied
balayé
what
an
expression
for
to
hear
and
she
explained
how
the
changes
had
taken
place
and
how
valuable
the
property
had
become
she
showed
me
a
small
plot
of
garden
a
fragment
of
my
old
garden
that
still
remained
and
where
the
old
might
still
have
been
but
that
it
had
been
sawed
away
i
saw
the
stump
that
did
duty
for
a
rustic
table
presently
looking
over
a
new
wall
i
saw
another
small
garden
and
in
it
the
ruins
of
the
old
shed
where
i
had
found
the
toy
wheelbarrow
soon
to
disappear
as
they
were
building
there
too
i
asked
after
all
the
people
i
could
think
of
beginning
with
those
of
least
interest
the
butcher
the
baker
the
some
were
dead
some
had
retired
and
had
left
their
commerce
to
their
children
and
three
different
had
kept
the
school
since
i
had
left
thank
heaven
there
was
still
the
school
much
altered
it
is
true
i
had
forgotten
to
look
for
it
illustration
the
old
she
had
no
remembrance
of
my
name
or
the
seraskiers
i
asked
with
a
beating
heart
we
had
left
no
trace
twelve
short
years
had
effaced
all
memory
of
us
but
she
told
me
that
a
gentleman
mais
tombé
en
lived
at
a
de
in
the
chaussée
de
la
muette
close
by
and
that
his
name
was
le
major
duquesnois
and
thither
i
went
after
rewarding
and
warmly
thanking
her
i
inquired
for
le
major
duquesnois
and
i
was
told
he
was
out
for
a
walk
and
i
soon
found
him
much
aged
and
bent
and
leaning
on
the
arm
of
a
sister
of
charity
i
was
so
touched
that
i
had
to
pass
him
two
or
three
times
before
i
could
speak
he
was
so
small
so
pathetically
small
illustration
le
major
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
could
give
him
an
idea
of
who
i
was
gogo
pasquier
then
after
a
while
he
seemed
to
recall
the
past
a
little
ha
ha
gogo
gentil
petit
gogo
oui
oui
portez
arrrmes
arrmes
bras
et
mimsé
bonne
petite
mimsé
toujours
mal
à
la
tête
he
could
just
remember
madame
seraskier
and
repeated
her
name
several
times
and
said
ah
elle
était
bien
belle
madame
seraskier
in
the
old
days
of
telling
when
he
used
to
get
tired
and
i
still
wanted
him
to
go
on
he
had
arranged
that
if
in
the
course
of
the
story
he
suddenly
brought
in
the
word
cric
and
i
failed
to
immediately
answer
crac
the
story
would
be
put
off
till
our
next
walk
to
be
continued
in
our
next
and
he
was
so
ingenious
in
the
way
he
brought
in
the
terrible
word
that
i
often
fell
into
the
trap
and
had
to
forego
my
delight
for
that
afternoon
i
suddenly
thought
of
saying
cric
and
he
immediately
said
crac
and
laughed
in
a
touching
senile
way
cric
crac
bien
ça
and
then
he
became
quite
serious
and
said
et
la
suite
au
prochain
numéro
after
this
he
began
to
cough
and
the
good
sister
said
je
crains
que
monsieur
ne
le
fatigue
un
peu
so
i
had
to
bid
him
and
after
i
had
squeezed
and
kissed
his
hand
he
made
me
a
most
courtly
bow
as
though
i
had
been
a
complete
stranger
i
rushed
away
tossing
up
my
arms
like
a
madman
in
my
pity
and
sorrow
for
my
dear
old
friend
and
my
general
regret
and
disenchantment
i
made
for
the
bois
de
boulogne
there
to
find
instead
of
the
old
thickets
and
ferneries
and
impenetrable
growth
a
huge
artificial
lake
with
and
skiffs
and
a
rockery
that
would
have
held
its
own
in
rosherville
gardens
and
on
the
way
thither
near
the
iron
gates
in
the
fortifications
whom
should
i
meet
but
one
of
my
friends
the
couriers
on
his
way
from
st
cloud
to
the
tuileries
there
he
rode
with
his
arms
jogging
up
and
down
and
his
low
glazed
hat
and
his
immense
just
the
same
as
ever
never
rising
in
his
stirrups
as
his
horse
trotted
to
the
jingle
of
the
sweet
little
chime
round
its
neck
illustration
green
and
gold
alas
his
coat
was
no
longer
the
innocent
unsophisticated
blue
and
silver
livery
of
the
bourgeois
king
but
the
hateful
green
and
gold
of
another
régime
farther
on
the
mare
itself
had
suffered
change
and
become
respectable
imperially
respectable
no
more
frogs
or
newts
or
i
felt
sure
but
gold
and
silver
fish
in
vulgar
napoleonic
profusion
no
words
that
i
can
find
would
give
any
idea
of
the
sadness
and
longing
that
filled
me
as
i
trod
once
more
that
sunlit
grassy
brink
the
goal
of
my
fond
ambition
for
twelve
long
years
it
was
sunday
and
many
people
were
about
many
children
in
their
best
sunday
clothes
and
on
their
best
behavior
discreetly
throwing
crumbs
to
the
fish
a
new
generation
much
quieter
and
better
dressed
than
my
cousins
and
i
who
had
once
so
filled
the
solitude
with
the
splashing
of
our
nets
and
the
excited
din
of
our
english
voices
as
i
sat
down
on
a
bench
by
the
old
willow
where
the
rat
lived
and
gazed
and
gazed
it
almost
surprised
me
that
the
very
intensity
of
my
desire
did
not
of
itself
suffice
to
call
up
the
old
familiar
faces
and
forms
and
conjure
away
these
modern
intruders
the
power
to
do
this
seemed
almost
within
my
reach
i
willed
and
willed
and
willed
with
all
my
might
but
in
vain
i
could
not
cheat
my
sight
or
hearing
for
a
moment
there
they
remained
unconscious
and
undisturbed
those
happy
little
french
people
and
fed
the
gold
and
silver
fish
and
there
with
an
aching
heart
i
left
them
oh
surely
surely
i
cried
to
myself
we
ought
to
find
some
means
of
possessing
the
past
more
fully
and
completely
than
we
do
life
is
not
worth
living
for
many
of
us
if
a
want
so
desperate
and
yet
so
natural
can
never
be
satisfied
memory
is
but
a
poor
rudimentary
thing
that
we
had
better
be
without
if
it
can
only
lead
us
to
the
verge
of
consummation
like
this
and
madden
us
with
a
desire
it
can
not
slake
the
touch
of
a
vanished
hand
the
sound
of
a
voice
that
is
still
the
tender
grace
of
a
day
that
is
dead
should
be
ours
forever
at
out
beck
and
call
by
some
exquisite
and
quite
conceivable
illusion
of
the
senses
alas
alas
i
have
hardly
the
hope
of
ever
meeting
my
beloved
ones
again
in
another
life
oh
to
meet
their
too
dimly
remembered
forms
in
just
as
they
once
were
by
some
trick
of
my
own
brain
to
see
them
with
the
eye
and
hear
them
with
the
ear
and
tread
with
them
the
old
obliterated
ways
as
in
a
waking
dream
it
would
be
well
worth
going
mad
to
become
such
a
as
that
thus
musing
sadly
i
reached
st
cloud
and
at
least
and
the
boulogne
that
led
me
to
it
had
not
been
very
perceptibly
altered
and
looked
as
though
i
had
only
left
them
a
week
ago
the
sweet
aspect
from
the
bridge
on
either
side
and
beyond
filled
me
with
the
old
enchantment
there
at
least
the
glory
had
not
departed
i
hastened
through
the
gilded
gates
and
up
the
broad
walk
to
the
grand
cascade
there
among
the
lovely
wreathed
urns
and
jars
of
geranium
still
sat
or
reclined
or
gesticulated
the
old
unalterable
gods
there
squatted
the
grimly
genial
monsters
in
granite
and
marble
and
bronze
still
spouting
their
endless
gallons
for
the
delectation
of
hot
parisian
eyes
unchanged
and
to
all
appearance
unchangeable
save
that
they
were
not
nearly
so
big
as
i
had
imagined
their
cold
smooth
ironical
patience
shamed
and
braced
me
into
better
cheer
beautiful
hideous
whatever
you
please
they
seemed
to
revel
in
the
very
sense
of
their
insensibility
of
their
eternal
stability
their
stony
scorn
of
time
and
wind
and
weather
and
the
peevish
discontent
of
man
it
was
good
to
fondly
pat
them
on
the
back
once
more
when
one
could
reach
them
and
cling
to
them
for
a
little
while
after
all
the
dust
and
drift
and
ruin
i
had
been
tramping
through
all
day
indeed
they
woke
in
me
a
healthy
craving
for
all
but
forgotten
earthly
joys
even
for
wretched
meat
and
drink
so
i
went
and
ordered
a
sumptuous
repast
at
the
tête
noire
a
tête
noire
alas
quite
white
all
in
stone
and
stucco
and
without
a
history
it
was
a
beautiful
sunset
waiting
for
my
dinner
i
gazed
out
of
the
window
and
found
balm
for
my
disappointed
and
regretful
spirit
in
all
that
democratic
joyousness
of
french
sunday
life
i
had
seen
it
over
and
over
again
just
like
that
in
the
old
days
at
least
was
like
coming
back
home
to
something
i
had
known
and
loved
the
cafés
on
the
little
place
between
the
bridge
and
the
park
were
full
to
overflowing
people
chatting
over
their
sat
right
out
almost
into
the
middle
of
the
square
so
thickly
packed
that
there
was
scarcely
room
for
the
busy
lively
waiters
to
move
between
them
the
air
was
full
of
the
scent
of
trodden
grass
and
macaroons
and
french
tobacco
blown
from
the
park
of
gay
french
laughter
and
the
music
of
of
a
light
dusty
haze
shot
with
purple
and
gold
by
the
setting
sun
the
river
alive
with
boats
and
canoes
repeated
the
glory
of
the
sky
and
the
hills
rose
before
me
culminating
in
the
lanterne
de
diogène
i
could
have
threaded
all
that
maze
of
trees
blindfolded
two
roman
pifferari
came
on
to
the
place
and
began
to
play
an
extraordinary
and
most
exciting
melody
that
almost
drew
me
out
of
the
window
it
seemed
to
have
no
particular
form
no
beginning
or
middle
or
end
it
went
soaring
higher
and
higher
like
the
song
of
a
lark
with
never
a
pause
for
breath
to
the
time
of
a
maddening
jig
a
tarantella
perhaps
always
on
the
strain
and
stress
always
getting
nearer
and
nearer
to
some
shrill
climax
of
ecstasy
quite
high
up
and
away
beyond
the
scope
of
earthly
music
while
the
persistent
drone
kept
buzzing
of
the
earth
and
the
impossibility
to
escape
all
so
gay
so
sad
there
is
no
name
for
it
two
little
deformed
and
dwarfs
beggars
brother
and
sister
with
large
toothless
gaps
for
mouths
and
no
upper
lip
began
to
dance
and
the
crowd
laughed
and
applauded
higher
and
higher
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
impossible
rose
the
quick
piercing
notes
of
the
piffero
heaven
seemed
almost
within
reach
the
nirvana
of
music
after
its
quick
madness
the
region
of
the
that
lies
beyond
the
ken
of
ordinary
human
ears
illustration
a
carriage
and
four
with
postilions
and
guides
came
clattering
royally
down
the
road
from
the
palace
and
dispersed
the
crowd
as
it
bowled
on
its
way
to
the
bridge
in
it
were
two
ladies
and
two
gentlemen
one
of
the
ladies
was
the
young
empress
of
the
french
the
other
looked
up
at
my
window
for
a
moment
as
in
a
soft
flash
of
summer
lightning
her
face
seemed
ablaze
with
friendly
recognition
with
a
sweet
glance
of
kindness
and
interest
and
surprise
a
glance
that
pierced
me
like
a
sudden
shaft
of
light
from
heaven
it
was
the
duchess
of
towers
i
felt
as
though
the
bagpipes
had
been
leading
up
to
this
in
a
moment
more
the
carriage
was
out
of
sight
the
sun
had
quite
gone
down
the
pifferari
had
ceased
to
play
and
were
walking
round
with
the
hat
and
all
was
over
i
dined
and
made
my
way
back
to
paris
on
foot
through
the
bois
de
boulogne
and
by
the
mare
and
saw
my
old
friend
the
swim
across
it
trailing
the
gleam
of
his
wake
after
him
like
a
silver
comet
tail
gens
de
la
nous

so
sang
a
festive
as
it
went
merrily
arm
in
arm
through
the
long
high
street
of
passy
with
a
gleeful
trust
that
would
have
filled
the
heart
with
envy
but
for
sad
experience
of
the
vanity
of
human
wishes
chez

how
charming
it
sounds
was
each
so
sure
that
when
he
reached
his
home
he
would
find
his
heart
desire
was
the
bridegroom
himself
so
very
sure
illustration
the
old
the
heart
desire
the
heart
regret
i
flattered
myself
that
i
had
pretty
well
sounded
the
uttermost
depths
of
both
on
that
eventful
sunday
part
four
illustration
i
got
back
to
my
hotel
in
the
rue
de
la
michodière
prostrate
with
emotion
and
fatigue
the
tarantella
still
jingling
in
my
ears
and
that
haunting
beloved
face
with
its
ineffable
smile
still
printed
on
the
retina
of
my
closed
eyes
i
fell
asleep
and
then
i
dreamed
a
dream
and
the
first
phase
of
my
real
inner
life
began
all
the
events
of
the
day
distorted
and
exaggerated
and
jumbled
together
after
the
usual
manner
of
dreams
wove
themselves
into
a
kind
of
nightmare
and
oppression
i
was
on
my
way
to
my
old
abode
everything
that
i
met
or
saw
was
grotesque
and
impossible
yet
had
now
the
strange
vague
charm
of
association
and
reminiscence
now
the
distressing
sense
of
change
and
loss
and
desolation
as
i
got
near
to
the
avenue
gate
instead
of
the
school
on
my
left
there
was
a
prison
and
at
the
door
a
little
jailer
three
feet
high
and
much
deformed
and
a
little
deformed
jaileress
no
bigger
than
himself
were
cunningly
watching
me
out
of
the
corners
of
their
eyes
and
toothlessly
smiling
presently
they
began
to
waltz
together
to
an
old
familiar
tune
with
their
enormous
keys
dangling
at
their
sides
and
they
looked
so
funny
that
i
laughed
and
applauded
but
soon
i
perceived
that
their
crooked
faces
were
not
really
funny
indeed
they
were
fatal
and
terrible
in
the
extreme
and
i
was
soon
conscious
that
these
deadly
dwarfs
were
trying
to
waltz
between
me
and
the
avenue
gate
for
which
i
was
bound
to
cut
me
off
that
they
might
run
me
into
the
prison
where
it
was
their
custom
to
hang
people
of
a
monday
morning
in
an
agony
of
terror
i
made
a
rush
for
the
avenue
gate
and
there
stood
the
duchess
of
towers
with
mild
surprise
in
her
eyes
and
a
kind
smile
a
heavenly
vision
of
strength
and
reality
you
are
not
dreaming
true
she
said
do
be
afraid
those
little
people
do
exist
give
me
your
hand
and
come
in
here
and
as
i
did
so
she
waved
the
troglodytes
away
and
they
vanished
and
i
felt
that
this
was
no
longer
a
dream
but
something
else
some
strange
thing
that
had
happened
to
me
some
new
life
that
i
had
woke
up
to
for
at
the
touch
of
her
hand
my
consciousness
my
sense
of
being
i
myself
which
hitherto
in
my
dream
as
in
all
previous
dreams
up
to
then
had
been
only
partial
intermittent
and
vague
suddenly
blazed
into
full
consistent
practical
activity
just
as
it
is
in
life
when
one
is
well
awake
and
much
interested
in
what
is
going
on
only
with
perceptions
far
keener
and
more
alert
i
knew
perfectly
who
i
was
and
what
i
was
and
remembered
all
the
events
of
the
previous
day
i
was
conscious
that
my
real
body
undressed
and
in
bed
now
lay
fast
asleep
in
a
small
room
on
the
fourth
floor
of
an
in
the
rue
de
la
michodière
i
knew
this
perfectly
and
yet
here
was
my
body
too
just
as
substantial
with
all
my
clothes
on
my
boots
rather
dusty
my
damp
with
the
heat
for
it
was
hot
with
my
disengaged
hand
i
felt
in
my
there
were
my
london
my
purse
my
penknife
my
handkerchief
in
the
breastpocket
of
my
coat
and
in
its
my
gloves
and
and
the
little
box
i
had
bought
that
morning
i
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
going
and
marked
eleven
i
pinched
myself
i
coughed
i
did
all
one
usually
does
under
the
pressure
of
some
immense
surprise
to
assure
myself
that
i
was
awake
and
i
and
yet
here
i
stood
actually
hand
in
hand
with
a
great
lady
to
whom
i
had
never
been
introduced
and
who
seemed
much
tickled
at
my
confusion
and
staring
now
at
her
now
at
my
old
school
the
prison
had
tumbled
down
like
a
house
of
cards
and
loi
in
its
place
was
saindou
just
as
it
had
been
of
old
i
even
recognized
on
the
yellow
wall
the
stamp
of
a
hand
in
dry
mud
made
fifteen
years
ago
by
a
day
boy
called
parisot
who
had
fallen
down
in
the
gutter
close
by
and
thus
left
his
mark
on
getting
up
again
and
it
had
remained
there
for
months
till
it
had
been
whitewashed
away
in
the
holidays
here
it
was
anew
after
fifteen
years
the
swallows
were
flying
and
twittering
a
yellow
omnibus
was
drawn
up
to
the
gates
of
the
school
the
horses
stamped
and
neighed
and
bit
each
other
as
french
horses
always
did
in
those
days
the
driver
swore
at
them
perfunctorily
a
crowd
was
looking
on
le
père
et
la
mère
françois
madame
liard
the
grocer
wife
and
other
people
whom
i
remembered
at
once
with
delight
just
in
front
of
us
a
small
boy
and
girl
were
looking
on
like
the
rest
and
i
recognized
the
back
and
the
cropped
head
and
thin
legs
of
mimsey
seraskier
a
was
playing
a
pretty
tune
i
knew
quite
well
and
had
forgotten
the
school
gates
opened
and
saindou
proud
and
full
of
as
he
always
was
and
half
a
dozen
boys
whose
faces
and
names
were
quite
familiar
to
me
in
smart
white
trousers
and
shining
boots
and
silken
white
bands
round
their
left
arms
got
into
the
omnibus
and
were
driven
away
in
a
glorified
manner
as
it
seemed
to
heaven
in
a
golden
chariot
it
was
beautiful
to
see
and
hear
i
was
still
holding
the
duchess
hand
and
felt
the
warmth
of
it
through
her
glove
it
stole
up
my
arm
like
a
magnetic
current
i
was
in
elysium
a
heavenly
sense
had
come
over
me
that
at
last
my
periphery
had
been
victoriously
invaded
by
a
spirit
other
than
mine
a
most
powerful
and
beneficent
spirit
there
was
a
blessed
fault
in
my
impenetrable
armor
of
self
after
all
and
the
genius
of
strength
and
charity
and
had
found
it
out
now
you
dreaming
true
she
said
where
are
those
boys
going
to
church
to
make
their
i
replied
that
right
you
dreaming
true
because
i
got
you
by
the
hand
do
you
know
that
tune
i
listened
and
the
words
belonging
to
it
came
out
of
the
past
and
i
said
them
to
her
and
she
laughed
again
with
her
eyes
screwed
up
deliciously
quite
right
quite
she
exclaimed
how
odd
that
you
should
know
them
how
well
you
pronounce
french
for
an
englishman
for
you
are
ibbetson
lady
cray
architect
i
assented
and
she
let
go
my
hand
the
street
was
full
of
people
familiar
forms
and
faces
and
voices
chatting
together
and
looking
down
the
road
after
the
yellow
omnibus
old
attitudes
old
tricks
of
gait
and
manner
old
forgotten
french
ways
of
speech
all
as
it
was
long
ago
nobody
noticed
us
and
we
walked
up
the
now
deserted
avenue
the
happiness
the
enchantment
of
it
all
could
it
be
that
i
was
dead
that
i
had
died
suddenly
in
my
sleep
at
the
hotel
in
the
rue
de
la
michodière
could
it
be
that
the
duchess
of
towers
was
dead
too
had
been
killed
by
some
accident
on
her
way
from
st
cloud
to
paris
and
that
both
having
died
so
near
each
other
we
had
begun
our
eternal
afterlife
in
this
heavenly
fashion
that
was
too
good
to
be
true
i
reflected
some
instinct
told
me
that
this
was
not
death
but
transcendent
earthly
life
and
also
alas
that
it
would
not
endure
forever
i
was
deeply
conscious
of
every
feature
in
her
face
every
movement
of
her
body
every
detail
of
her
dress
more
so
then
i
could
have
been
in
actual
life
and
said
to
myself
whatever
this
is
it
is
no
dream
but
i
felt
there
was
about
me
the
unspeakable
elation
which
can
come
to
us
only
in
our
waking
moments
when
we
are
at
our
very
best
and
then
only
feebly
in
comparison
with
this
and
to
many
of
us
never
ft
never
had
to
me
since
that
morning
when
i
had
found
the
little
wheelbarrow
i
was
also
conscious
however
that
the
avenue
itself
had
a
slight
touch
of
the
dream
in
it
it
was
no
longer
quite
right
and
was
getting
out
of
drawing
and
perspective
so
to
speak
i
had
lost
my
stay
the
touch
of
her
hand
are
you
still
dreaming
true
mr
ibbetson
i
am
afraid
not
quite
i
replied
you
must
try
by
yourself
a
little
try
hard
look
at
this
house
what
is
written
on
the
portico
i
saw
written
in
gold
letters
the
words
tête
noire
and
said
so
illustration
she
rippled
with
laughter
and
said
no
try
again
and
just
touched
me
with
the
tip
of
her
finger
for
a
moment
i
tried
again
and
said
parvis
notre
dame
that
rather
better
she
said
and
touched
me
again
and
i
read
parva
sed
apta
as
i
had
so
often
read
there
before
in
old
days
and
now
look
at
that
old
house
over
there
pointing
to
my
old
home
how
many
windows
are
there
in
the
top
story
i
said
seven
no
there
are
five
look
again
and
there
were
five
and
the
whole
house
was
exactly
down
to
its
minutest
detail
as
it
had
been
once
upon
a
time
i
could
see
thérèse
through
one
of
the
windows
making
my
bed
that
better
said
the
duchess
you
will
soon
do
it
it
very
easy
que
le
premier
pas
my
father
taught
me
you
must
always
sleep
on
your
back
with
your
arms
above
your
head
your
hands
clasped
under
it
and
your
feet
crossed
the
right
one
over
the
left
unless
you
are
and
you
must
never
for
a
moment
cease
thinking
of
where
you
want
to
be
in
your
dream
till
you
are
asleep
and
get
there
and
you
must
never
forget
in
your
dream
where
and
what
you
were
when
awake
you
must
join
the
dream
on
to
reality
do
forget
and
now
i
will
say
but
before
i
go
give
me
both
hands
and
look
round
everywhere
as
far
as
your
eyes
can
see
it
was
hard
to
look
away
from
her
her
face
drew
my
eyes
and
through
them
all
my
heart
but
i
did
as
she
told
me
and
took
in
the
whole
familiar
scene
even
to
the
distant
woods
of
ville
a
glimpse
of
which
was
visible
through
an
opening
in
the
trees
even
to
the
smoke
of
a
train
making
its
way
to
versailles
miles
off
and
the
old
telegraph
working
its
black
arms
on
the
top
of
mont
valérien
illustration
it
was
hard
to
look
away
from
her
is
it
all
right
she
asked
that
well
henceforward
whenever
you
come
here
you
will
be
safe
as
far
as
your
sight
can
reach
from
this
spot
all
through
my
introduction
see
what
it
is
to
have
a
friend
at
court
no
more
little
dancing
jailers
and
then
you
can
gradually
get
farther
by
yourself
out
there
through
that
park
leads
to
the
bois
de
boulogne
there
a
gap
in
the
hedge
you
can
get
through
but
mind
and
make
everything
plain
in
front
of
you
before
you
go
a
step
farther
or
else
have
to
wake
and
begin
it
all
over
again
you
have
only
to
will
it
and
think
of
yourself
as
awake
and
it
will
come
on
condition
of
course
that
you
have
been
there
before
and
mind
also
you
must
take
care
how
you
touch
things
or
people
you
may
hear
and
see
and
smell
but
you
must
touch
nor
pick
flowers
or
leaves
nor
move
things
about
it
blurs
the
dream
like
breathing
on
a
i
do
know
why
but
it
does
you
must
remember
that
everything
here
is
dead
and
gone
by
with
you
and
me
it
is
different
we
alive
and
real
that
is
am
and
there
would
seem
to
be
no
mistake
about
your
being
real
too
ibbetson
by
the
grasp
of
your
hands
but
you
and
why
you
are
here
and
what
business
you
have
in
this
my
particular
dream
i
can
not
understand
no
living
person
has
ever
come
into
it
before
i
ca
make
it
out
i
suppose
it
because
i
saw
your
reality
this
afternoon
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
noire
and
you
are
just
a
stray
figment
of
my
overtired
brain
a
very
agreeable
figment
i
admit
but
you
do
exist
here
just
now
you
ca
possibly
you
are
somewhere
else
ibbetson
dancing
at
mabille
perhaps
or
fast
asleep
somewhere
and
dreaming
of
french
churches
and
palaces
and
public
fountains
like
a
good
young
british
architect
otherwise
i
talk
to
you
like
this
you
may
be
sure
never
mind
i
am
very
glad
to
dream
that
i
have
been
of
use
to
you
and
you
are
very
welcome
here
if
it
amuses
you
to
come
especially
as
you
are
only
a
false
dream
of
mine
for
what
else
you
be
and
now
i
must
leave
you
so
she
disengaged
her
hands
and
laughed
her
angelic
laugh
and
then
turned
towards
the
park
i
watched
her
tall
straight
figure
and
blowing
skirts
and
saw
her
follow
some
ladies
and
children
into
a
thicket
that
i
remembered
well
and
she
was
soon
out
of
sight
i
felt
as
if
all
warmth
had
gone
out
of
my
life
as
if
a
joy
had
taken
flight
as
if
a
precious
something
had
withdrawn
itself
from
my
possession
and
the
gap
in
my
periphery
had
closed
again
long
i
stood
in
thought
with
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
spot
where
she
had
disappeared
and
i
felt
inclined
to
follow
but
then
considered
this
would
not
have
been
discreet
for
although
she
was
only
a
false
dream
of
mine
a
mere
recollection
of
the
exciting
and
eventful
day
a
stray
figment
of
my
overtired
and
excited
brain
a
than
agreeable
figment
what
else
she
be
she
was
also
a
great
lady
and
had
treated
me
a
perfect
stranger
and
a
perfect
nobody
with
singular
courtesy
and
kindness
which
i
repaid
it
is
true
with
a
love
so
deep
and
strong
that
my
very
life
was
hers
to
do
what
she
liked
with
and
always
had
been
since
i
first
saw
her
and
always
would
be
as
long
as
there
was
breath
in
my
body
but
this
did
not
constitute
an
acquaintance
without
a
proper
introduction
even
in
france
even
in
a
dream
even
in
dreams
one
must
be
polite
even
to
stray
figments
of
one
tired
sleeping
brain
and
then
what
business
had
in
particular
dream
as
she
herself
had
asked
of
me
but
it
a
dream
i
remembered
my
lodgings
at
pentonville
that
i
had
left
yesterday
morning
i
remembered
what
i
was
why
i
came
to
paris
i
remembered
the
very
bedroom
at
the
paris
hotel
where
i
was
now
fast
asleep
its
clock
and
all
the
meagre
furniture
and
here
was
i
broad
awake
and
conscious
in
the
middle
of
an
old
avenue
that
had
long
ceased
to
exist
that
had
been
built
over
by
a
huge
brick
edifice
covered
with
i
saw
it
this
edifice
myself
only
twelve
hours
ago
and
yet
here
was
everything
as
it
had
been
when
i
was
a
child
and
all
through
the
agency
of
this
solid
phantom
of
a
lovely
young
english
duchess
whose
warm
gloved
hands
i
had
only
this
minute
been
holding
in
mine
the
scent
of
her
gloves
was
still
in
my
palm
i
looked
at
my
watch
it
marked
minutes
to
twelve
all
this
had
happened
in
less
than
of
an
hour
pondering
over
all
this
in
hopeless
bewilderment
i
turned
my
steps
towards
my
old
home
and
to
my
surprise
was
just
able
to
look
over
the
garden
wall
which
i
had
once
thought
about
ten
feet
high
under
the
old
in
full
bloom
sat
my
mother
darning
small
socks
with
her
flaxen
as
it
was
her
fashion
to
wear
them
her
face
my
emotion
and
astonishment
were
immense
my
heart
beat
fast
i
felt
its
pulse
in
my
temples
and
my
breath
was
short
at
a
little
green
table
that
i
remembered
well
sat
a
small
boy
rather
quaintly
dressed
in
a
fashion
with
a
frill
round
his
wide
and
his
golden
hair
cut
quite
close
at
the
top
and
rather
long
at
the
sides
and
back
it
was
gogo
pasquier
he
seemed
a
very
nice
little
boy
he
had
pen
and
ink
and
before
him
and
a
volume
bound
in
red
morocco
i
knew
it
at
a
glance
it
was
the
dog
médor
lay
asleep
in
the
shade
the
bees
were
droning
among
the
nasturtiums
and
convolvulus
a
little
girl
ran
up
the
avenue
from
the
porter
lodge
and
pushed
the
garden
gate
which
rang
the
bell
as
it
opened
and
she
went
into
the
garden
and
i
followed
her
but
she
took
no
notice
of
me
nor
did
the
others
it
was
mimsey
seraskier
i
went
out
and
sat
at
my
mother
feet
and
looked
long
in
her
face
i
must
not
speak
to
her
nor
touch
her
not
even
touch
her
busy
hand
with
my
lips
or
i
should
blur
the
dream
i
got
up
and
looked
over
the
boy
gogo
shoulder
he
was
translating
gray
into
french
he
had
not
got
very
far
and
seemed
to
be
stumped
by
the
line
and
leaves
the
world
to
darkness
and
to
me
mimsey
was
silently
looking
over
his
other
shoulder
her
thumb
in
her
mouth
one
arm
on
the
back
of
his
chair
she
seemed
to
be
stumped
also
it
was
an
awkward
line
to
translate
i
stooped
and
put
my
hand
to
médor
nose
and
felt
his
warm
breath
he
wagged
his
rudiment
of
a
tail
and
whimpered
in
his
sleep
mimsey
said
regarde
médor
comme
il
remue
la
queue
le
prince
charmant
qui
lui
chatouille
le
bout
du
said
my
mother
who
had
not
spoken
hitherto
do
speak
english
mimsey
please
oh
my
god
my
mother
voice
so
forgotten
yet
so
familiar
so
unutterably
dear
i
rushed
to
her
and
threw
myself
on
my
knees
at
her
feet
and
seized
her
hand
and
kissed
it
crying
mother
mother
a
strange
blur
came
over
everything
the
sense
of
reality
was
lost
all
became
as
a
dream
a
beautiful
dream
but
only
a
dream
and
i
woke
i
woke
in
my
small
hotel
bedroom
and
saw
all
the
furniture
and
my
hat
and
clothes
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
outside
and
heard
the
ticking
of
the
clock
on
the
and
the
rumbling
of
a
cart
and
cracking
of
a
whip
in
the
street
and
yet
felt
i
was
not
a
bit
more
awake
than
i
had
been
a
minute
ago
in
my
strange
vision
not
so
much
i
heard
my
watch
ticking
its
little
tick
on
the
by
the
side
of
the
clock
like
a
pony
trotting
by
a
big
horse
the
clock
struck
twelve
i
got
up
and
looked
at
my
watch
by
the
light
of
the
streets
it
marked
the
same
my
dream
had
lasted
an
hour
i
had
gone
to
bed
at
ten
i
tried
to
recall
it
all
and
did
so
to
the
smallest
particular
all
except
the
tune
the
organ
had
played
and
the
words
belonging
to
it
they
were
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
and
refused
to
come
further
i
got
up
again
and
walked
about
the
room
and
felt
that
it
had
not
been
like
a
dream
at
all
it
was
more
recollectable
than
all
my
real
adventures
of
the
previous
day
it
had
ceased
to
be
like
a
dream
and
had
become
an
actuality
from
the
moment
i
first
touched
the
duchess
hand
to
the
moment
i
kissed
my
mother
and
the
blur
came
it
was
an
entirely
new
and
utterly
bewildering
experience
that
i
had
gone
through
in
a
dream
there
are
always
breaks
inconsistencies
lapses
incoherence
breaches
of
continuity
many
links
missing
in
the
chain
only
at
points
is
the
impression
vivid
enough
to
stamp
itself
afterwards
on
the
waking
mind
and
even
then
it
is
never
so
really
vivid
as
the
impression
of
real
life
although
it
ought
to
have
seemed
so
in
the
dream
one
remembers
it
well
on
awaking
but
soon
it
fades
and
then
it
is
only
one
remembrance
of
it
that
one
remembers
illustration
mother
mother
there
was
nothing
of
this
in
my
dream
it
was
something
like
the
on
ramsgate
pier
one
goes
in
and
finds
one
self
in
total
darkness
the
eye
is
prepared
one
is
thoroughly
expectant
and
suddenly
there
flashes
on
the
sight
the
moving
picture
of
the
port
and
all
the
life
therein
and
the
houses
and
cliffs
beyond
and
farther
still
the
green
hills
the
white
clouds
and
blue
sky
little
green
waves
chase
each
other
in
the
harbor
breaking
into
crisp
white
foam
wheel
and
dash
and
dip
behind
masts
and
ropes
and
pulleys
shiny
brass
fittings
on
gangway
and
compass
flash
in
the
sun
without
dazzling
the
eye
gay
liliputians
walk
and
talk
their
white
teeth
no
bigger
than
a
pin
point
gleam
in
laughter
with
never
a
sound
a
steamboat
laden
with
excursionists
comes
in
its
paddles
churning
the
water
and
you
can
not
hear
them
not
a
detail
is
missed
not
a
button
on
a
sailor
jacket
not
a
hair
on
his
face
all
the
light
and
color
of
sea
and
earth
and
sky
that
serve
for
many
a
mile
are
here
concentrated
within
a
few
square
feet
and
what
color
it
is
a
painter
despair
it
is
light
itself
more
beautiful
than
that
which
streams
through
old
church
windows
of
stained
glass
and
all
is
framed
in
utter
darkness
so
that
the
fully
dilated
pupils
can
see
their
very
utmost
it
seems
as
though
all
had
been
painted
and
then
shrunk
like
a
japanese
picture
on
crape
to
a
millionth
of
its
natural
size
so
as
to
intensify
and
mellow
the
effect
it
is
all
over
you
come
out
into
the
open
sunshine
and
all
seems
garish
and
bare
and
bald
and
commonplace
all
magic
has
faded
out
of
the
scene
everything
is
too
far
away
from
everything
else
everybody
one
meets
seems
coarse
and
brobdingnagian
and
too
near
and
one
has
been
looking
at
the
like
of
it
all
one
life
thus
with
my
dream
compared
to
common
waking
experience
only
instead
of
being
mere
flat
silent
little
images
moving
on
a
dozen
square
feet
of
and
appealing
to
the
eye
alone
the
things
and
people
in
my
dream
had
the
same
roundness
and
relief
as
in
life
and
were
one
could
move
among
them
and
behind
them
and
feel
as
if
one
could
touch
and
clasp
and
embrace
them
if
one
dared
and
the
ear
as
well
as
the
eye
was
made
free
of
this
dark
chamber
of
the
brain
one
heard
their
speech
and
laughter
as
in
life
and
that
was
not
all
for
soft
breezes
fanned
the
cheek
the
sparrows
twittered
the
sun
gave
out
its
warmth
and
the
scent
of
many
flowers
made
the
illusion
complete
and
then
the
duchess
of
towers
she
had
been
not
only
visible
and
audible
like
the
rest
but
tangible
as
well
to
the
fullest
extent
of
the
sensibility
that
lay
in
my
nerves
of
touch
when
my
hands
held
hers
i
felt
as
though
i
were
drawing
all
her
life
into
mine
with
the
exception
of
that
one
figure
all
had
evidently
been
as
it
been
in
a
few
years
ago
to
the
very
droning
of
an
insect
to
the
very
fall
of
a
blossom
had
i
gone
mad
by
any
chance
i
had
possessed
the
past
as
i
had
longed
to
do
a
few
hours
before
what
are
sight
and
hearing
and
touch
and
the
rest
five
senses
in
all
the
stars
worlds
upon
worlds
so
many
billions
of
miles
away
what
are
they
for
us
but
mere
shiny
specks
on
a
of
nerves
behind
the
eye
how
does
one
them
there
the
sound
of
my
friend
voice
what
is
it
the
clasp
of
his
hand
the
pleasant
sight
of
his
face
the
scent
of
his
pipe
and
mine
the
taste
of
the
bread
and
cheese
and
beer
we
eat
and
drink
together
what
are
they
but
figments
stray
figments
perhaps
of
the
brain
little
thrills
through
nerves
made
on
purpose
and
without
which
there
would
be
no
stars
no
pipe
no
bread
and
cheese
and
beer
no
voice
no
friend
no
me
and
is
there
perchance
some
sixth
sense
embedded
somewhere
in
the
thickness
of
the
flesh
some
survival
of
the
past
of
the
race
of
our
own
childhood
even
etiolated
by
disuse
or
some
rudiment
some
effort
to
begin
some
priceless
hidden
faculty
to
be
developed
into
a
future
source
of
bliss
and
consolation
for
our
descendants
some
nerve
that
now
can
only
be
made
to
thrill
and
vibrate
in
a
dream
too
delicate
as
yet
to
ply
its
function
in
the
light
of
common
day
and
was
i
of
all
people
in
the
world
i
peter
ibbetson
architect
and
surveyor
wharton
street
pentonville
most
futile
desultory
and
uneducated
dreamer
of
dreams
destined
to
make
some
great
psychical
discovery
pondering
deeply
over
these
solemn
things
i
sent
myself
to
sleep
again
as
was
natural
enough
but
no
more
to
dream
i
slept
soundly
until
late
in
the
morning
and
breakfasted
at
the
bains
deligny
a
delightful
near
the
pont
de
la
concorde
on
the
other
side
and
spent
most
of
the
day
there
alternately
swimming
and
dozing
and
smoking
cigarettes
and
thinking
of
the
wonders
of
the
night
before
and
hoping
for
their
repetition
on
the
night
to
follow
illustration
i
remained
a
week
in
paris
loafing
about
by
day
among
old
haunts
of
my
childhood
a
melancholy
pleasure
and
at
night
trying
to
dream
true
as
my
dream
duchess
had
called
it
only
once
did
i
succeed
i
had
gone
to
bed
thinking
most
persistently
of
the
mare
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
as
soon
as
i
was
fairly
asleep
i
woke
up
there
and
knew
directly
that
i
had
come
into
a
true
dream
again
by
the
reality
and
the
bliss
it
was
transcendent
once
more
a
very
ecstasy
of
remembrance
made
actual
and
an
exquisite
surprise
there
was
le
major
in
his
green
on
his
knees
near
a
little
by
the
brink
among
the
roots
of
which
there
dwelt
a
cunning
old
dytiscus
as
big
as
the
bowl
of
a
a
prize
we
had
often
tried
to
catch
in
vain
le
major
had
a
net
in
his
hand
and
was
watching
the
water
intently
the
perspiration
was
trickling
down
his
nose
and
around
him
in
silent
expectation
and
suspense
were
grouped
gogo
and
mimsey
and
my
three
cousins
and
a
freckled
irish
boy
i
had
quite
forgotten
and
i
suddenly
remembered
that
his
name
was
johnstone
that
he
was
very
combative
and
that
he
lived
in
the
rue
basse
now
rue
raynouard
on
the
other
side
of
the
pond
my
mother
was
keeping
médor
from
the
water
for
fear
of
his
spoiling
the
sport
and
on
the
bench
by
the
willow
sat
madame
seraskier
lovely
madame
seraskier
deeply
interested
i
sat
down
by
her
side
and
gazed
at
her
with
a
joy
there
is
no
telling
an
old
woman
came
by
selling
conical
and
singing
mesdames
madame
seraskier
bought
ten
worth
a
mountain
le
major
made
a
dash
with
his
net
unsuccessfully
as
usual
médor
was
let
loose
and
plunged
with
a
plunge
that
made
big
waves
all
round
the
mare
and
dived
after
an
imaginary
stone
amid
general
shouts
and
shrieks
of
excitement
oh
the
familiar
voices
i
almost
wept
médor
came
out
of
the
water
without
his
stone
and
shook
himself
twisting
and
barking
and
grinning
and
gyrating
as
was
his
way
quite
close
to
me
in
my
delight
and
sympathy
i
was
enough
to
try
and
stroke
him
and
straight
the
dream
was
blurred
changed
to
an
ordinary
dream
where
all
things
were
jumbled
up
and
incomprehensible
a
dream
pleasant
enough
but
different
in
kind
and
degree
an
ordinary
dream
and
in
my
distress
thereat
i
woke
and
failed
to
dream
again
as
i
wished
to
dream
that
night
next
morning
after
an
early
swim
i
went
to
the
louvre
and
stood
spellbound
before
leonardo
da
vinci
lisa
gioconda
trying
hard
to
find
where
the
wondrous
beauty
lay
that
i
had
heard
so
extravagantly
extolled
and
not
trying
very
successfully
for
i
had
seen
madame
seraskier
once
more
and
felt
that
gioconda
was
a
fraud
presently
i
was
conscious
of
a
group
just
behind
me
and
heard
a
pleasant
male
english
voice
exclaim
illustration
lisa
giaconda
and
now
duchess
let
me
present
to
you
my
first
and
last
and
only
love
mona
lisa
i
turned
round
and
there
stood
a
old
gentleman
and
two
ladies
one
of
whom
was
the
duchess
of
towers
staring
at
the
picture
as
i
made
way
for
them
i
caught
her
eye
and
in
it
again
as
i
felt
sure
a
kindly
look
of
recognition
just
for
half
a
second
she
evidently
recollected
having
seen
me
at
lady
cray
where
i
had
stood
all
the
evening
alone
in
a
rather
conspicuous
corner
i
was
so
exceptionally
tall
in
those
days
of
not
such
tall
people
as
now
that
it
was
easy
to
notice
and
remember
me
especially
as
i
wore
my
beard
which
it
was
unusual
to
do
then
among
englishmen
she
little
guessed
how
remembered
she
little
knew
all
she
was
and
had
been
to
me
in
life
and
in
a
dream
my
emotion
was
so
great
that
i
felt
it
in
my
very
knees
i
could
scarcely
walk
i
was
as
weak
as
water
my
worship
for
the
beautiful
stranger
was
becoming
almost
a
madness
she
was
even
more
lovely
than
madame
seraskier
it
was
cruel
to
be
like
that
it
seems
that
i
was
fated
to
fall
down
and
prostrate
myself
before
very
tall
slender
women
with
dark
hair
and
lily
skins
and
light
angelic
eyes
the
fair
damsel
who
sold
tripe
and
pigs
feet
in
clerkenwell
was
also
of
that
type
i
remembered
and
so
was
deane
fortunately
for
me
it
is
not
a
common
one
all
that
day
i
spent
on
quays
and
bridges
leaning
over
parapets
and
looking
at
the
seine
and
nursing
my
sweet
despair
and
calling
myself
the
biggest
fool
in
paris
and
recalling
over
and
over
again
that
kindly
glance
my
only
light
the
light
of
the
world
for
me
my
brief
holiday
over
i
went
back
to
london
to
pentonville
and
resumed
my
old
occupations
but
the
whole
tenor
of
my
existence
was
changed
the
day
the
and
i
worked
harder
than
ever
to
great
satisfaction
passed
as
in
an
unimportant
dream
of
mild
content
and
cheerful
acquiescence
in
everything
work
or
play
there
was
no
more
quarrelling
with
my
destiny
nor
wish
to
escape
from
myself
for
a
moment
my
whole
being
as
i
went
about
on
business
or
recreation
bent
was
suffused
with
the
memory
of
the
duchess
of
towers
as
with
a
warm
inner
glow
that
kept
me
at
peace
with
all
mankind
and
myself
and
thrilled
by
the
hope
the
enchanting
hope
of
once
more
meeting
her
image
at
night
in
a
dream
in
or
about
my
old
home
at
passy
and
perhaps
even
feeling
once
more
that
ineffable
bliss
of
touching
her
hand
though
why
should
she
be
there
when
the
blessed
hour
came
round
for
sleep
the
real
business
of
my
life
began
i
practised
dreaming
true
as
one
practises
a
fine
art
and
after
many
failures
i
became
a
professed
expert
a
master
i
lay
straight
on
my
back
with
my
feet
crossed
and
my
hands
clasped
above
my
head
in
a
symmetrical
position
i
would
fix
my
will
intently
and
persistently
on
a
certain
point
in
space
and
time
that
was
within
my
memory
for
instance
the
avenue
gate
on
a
certain
christmas
afternoon
when
i
remembered
waiting
for
le
major
to
go
for
a
walk
at
the
same
time
never
losing
touch
of
my
own
present
identity
as
peter
ibbetson
architect
wharton
street
pentonville
all
of
which
is
not
so
easy
to
manage
as
one
might
think
although
the
dream
duchess
had
said
ce
que
le
premier
pas
qui
coûte
and
finally
one
night
instead
of
dreaming
the
ordinary
dreams
i
had
dreamed
all
my
life
but
twice
i
had
the
rapture
of
the
minute
i
was
fairly
asleep
by
the
avenue
gate
and
of
seeing
gogo
pasquier
sitting
on
one
of
the
stone
posts
and
looking
up
the
snowy
street
for
the
major
presently
he
jumped
up
to
meet
his
old
friend
whose
figure
had
just
appeared
in
the
distance
i
saw
and
heard
their
warm
and
friendly
greeting
and
walked
unperceived
by
their
side
through
auteuil
to
the
and
back
by
the
fortifications
and
listened
to
the
thrilling
adventures
of
one
which
i
confess
i
had
completely
forgotten
illustration
the
story
of
the
giant
as
we
passed
all
three
together
through
the
porte
de
la
muette
le
major
powers
of
memory
or
invention
began
to
flag
a
little
for
he
suddenly
said
but
gogo
pitilessly
answered
and
the
story
had
to
go
on
till
we
reached
at
dusk
the
gate
of
the
pasquiers
house
where
these
two
most
affectionately
parted
after
making
an
appointment
for
the
morrow
and
i
went
in
with
gogo
and
sat
in
the
while
thérèse
gave
him
his
tea
and
heard
her
tell
him
all
that
had
happened
in
passy
that
afternoon
then
he
read
and
summed
and
translated
with
his
mother
till
it
was
time
to
go
up
to
bed
and
i
sat
by
his
bedside
as
he
was
lulled
asleep
by
his
harp
how
i
listened
with
all
my
ears
and
heart
till
the
sweet
strain
ceased
for
the
night
then
out
of
the
hushed
house
i
stole
thinking
unutterable
things
through
the
garden
where
médor
was
baying
the
moon
through
the
silent
avenue
and
park
through
the
deserted
streets
of
passy
and
on
by
desolate
quays
and
bridges
to
dark
quarters
of
paris
till
i
fell
awake
in
my
tracks
and
found
that
another
dreary
and
commonplace
day
had
dawned
over
london
but
no
longer
dreary
and
commonplace
for
me
with
such
experiences
to
look
back
and
forward
to
such
a
strange
inheritance
of
wonder
and
delight
i
had
a
few
more
occasional
failures
such
as
for
instance
when
the
thread
between
my
waking
and
sleeping
life
was
snapped
by
a
carelessness
or
possibly
by
some
movement
of
my
body
in
bed
in
which
case
the
vision
would
suddenly
get
blurred
the
reality
of
it
destroyed
and
an
ordinary
dream
rise
in
its
place
my
immediate
consciousness
of
this
was
enough
to
wake
me
on
the
spot
and
i
would
begin
again
till
all
went
as
i
wished
evidently
our
brain
contains
something
akin
both
to
a
photographic
plate
and
a
phonographic
cylinder
and
many
other
things
of
the
same
kind
not
yet
discovered
not
a
sight
or
a
sound
or
a
smell
is
lost
not
a
taste
or
a
feeling
or
an
emotion
unconscious
memory
records
them
all
without
our
even
heeding
what
goes
on
around
us
beyond
the
things
that
attract
our
immediate
interest
or
attention
thus
night
after
night
i
saw
reacted
before
me
scenes
not
only
fairly
remembered
but
scenes
utterly
forgotten
and
yet
as
unmistakably
true
as
the
remembered
ones
and
all
bathed
in
that
ineffable
light
the
light
of
other
days
the
light
that
never
was
on
sea
or
land
and
yet
the
light
of
absolute
truth
how
it
transcends
in
value
as
well
as
in
beauty
the
garish
light
of
common
day
by
which
poor
humanity
has
hitherto
been
content
to
live
and
die
disdaining
through
lack
of
knowledge
the
shadow
for
the
substance
the
spirit
for
the
matter
i
verified
the
truth
of
these
sleeping
experiences
in
every
detail
old
family
letters
i
had
preserved
and
which
i
studied
on
awaking
confirmed
what
i
had
seen
and
heard
in
my
dream
old
stories
explained
themselves
it
was
all
truth
garnered
in
some
remote
corner
of
the
brain
and
brought
out
of
the
dim
past
as
i
willed
and
made
actual
once
more
and
strange
to
say
and
most
inexplicable
i
saw
it
all
as
an
independent
spectator
an
outsider
not
as
an
actor
going
again
through
scenes
in
which
he
has
played
a
part
before
yet
many
things
perplexed
and
puzzled
me
for
instance
gogo
back
and
the
back
of
his
head
when
i
stood
behind
him
were
as
visible
and
apparently
as
true
to
life
as
his
face
and
i
had
never
seen
his
back
or
the
back
of
his
head
it
was
much
later
in
life
that
i
learned
the
secret
of
two
mirrors
and
then
when
gogo
went
out
of
the
room
sometimes
apparently
passing
through
me
as
he
did
so
and
coming
out
at
the
other
side
with
a
momentary
blurring
of
the
dream
the
rest
would
go
on
talking
just
as
reasonably
as
naturally
as
before
could
the
trees
and
walls
and
furniture
have
had
ears
and
eyes
those
trees
and
walls
and
furniture
that
existed
now
only
in
my
sleeping
brain
and
have
retained
the
sound
and
shape
and
meaning
of
all
that
passed
when
gogo
my
only
conceivable
remembrancer
was
away
françoise
the
cook
would
come
into
the
to
discuss
the
dinner
with
my
mother
when
gogo
was
at
school
and
i
would
hear
the
orders
given
and
later
i
would
assist
at
the
eating
of
the
meal
to
which
gogo
would
invariably
do
ample
justice
and
it
was
just
as
my
mother
had
ordered
mystery
of
mysteries
what
a
pleasant
life
it
was
they
led
together
these
ghosts
of
a
time
such
a
genial
smooth
easygoing
state
of
things
half
bourgeois
half
bohemian
and
yet
with
a
simplicity
refinement
and
distinction
of
bearing
and
speech
that
were
quite
aristocratic
the
servants
only
three
thérèse
the
françoise
the
cook
and
english
sarah
who
had
been
my
nurse
and
was
now
my
mother
maid
were
on
the
kindliest
and
most
familiar
terms
with
us
and
talked
to
us
like
friends
and
interested
themselves
in
our
concerns
and
we
in
theirs
i
noticed
that
they
always
wished
us
each
and
a
pretty
french
fashion
of
the
passy
bourgeoisie
in
louis
philippe
time
he
was
a
bourgeois
king
our
cuisine
was
bourgeoise
also
peter

excellent

at

a
bottle
in
those
happy
days
its
bouquet
seemed
to
fill
the
room
as
soon
as
the
cork
was
drawn
sometimes
such
a
repast
ended
le
beau
pasquier
in
the
fulness
of
his
heart
would
suddenly
let
off
impossible
fireworks
of
vocalization
ascending
rockets
of
chromatic
notes
which
would
explode
softly
very
high
up
and
come
down
in
full
cadences
trills
roulades
like
beautiful
colored
stars
and
thérèse
would
exclaim
ah
beau
as
if
she
had
been
present
at
a
real
pyrotechnic
display
and
thérèse
was
quite
right
i
have
never
heard
the
like
from
any
human
throat
and
should
not
have
believed
it
possible
only
joachim
violin
can
do
such
beautiful
things
so
beautifully
or
else
he
would
tell
us
of
wolves
he
had
shot
in
brittany
or
in
burgundy
for
he
was
a
great
sportsman
or
of
his
adventures
as
a
du
of
charles
dix
or
of
the
wonderful
inventions
that
were
so
soon
to
bring
us
fame
and
fortune
and
he
would
loyally
drink
to
henri
cinq
and
he
was
so
droll
and
buoyant
and
witty
that
it
was
as
good
to
hear
him
speak
as
to
hear
him
sing
but
there
was
another
and
a
sad
side
to
all
this
strange
comedy
of
vanished
lives
they
built
castles
in
the
air
and
made
plans
and
talked
of
all
the
wealth
and
happiness
that
would
be
theirs
when
my
father
ship
came
home
and
of
all
the
good
they
would
do
pathetically
unconscious
of
the
near
future
which
of
course
was
all
past
history
to
their
loving
audience
of
one
and
then
my
tears
would
flow
with
the
unbearable
ache
of
love
and
pity
combined
they
would
fall
and
dry
on
the
waxed
floors
of
my
old
home
in
passy
and
i
would
find
them
still
wet
on
my
pillow
in
pentonville
when
i
woke
soon
i
discovered
by
practice
that
i
was
able
for
a
second
or
two
to
be
more
than
a
mere
spectator
to
be
an
actor
once
more
to
turn
myself
ibbetson
into
my
old
self
gogo
and
thus
be
touched
and
caressed
by
those
i
had
so
loved
my
mother
kissed
me
and
i
felt
it
just
as
long
as
i
could
hold
my
breath
i
could
walk
hand
in
hand
with
madame
seraskier
or
feel
mimsey
small
weight
on
my
back
and
her
arms
round
my
neck
for
four
or
five
yards
as
i
walked
before
blurring
the
dream
and
the
blur
would
soon
pass
away
if
it
did
not
wake
me
and
i
was
peter
ibbetson
once
more
walking
and
sitting
among
them
hearing
them
talk
and
laugh
watching
them
at
their
meals
in
their
walks
listening
to
my
songs
my
mother
sweet
playing
and
always
unseen
and
unheeded
by
them
moreover
i
soon
learned
to
touch
things
without
sensibly
blurring
the
dream
i
would
cull
a
rose
and
stick
it
in
my
buttonhole
and
there
it
remained
but
lo
the
very
rose
i
had
just
culled
was
still
on
the
also
i
would
pick
up
a
stone
and
throw
it
at
the
wall
where
it
disappeared
without
a
sound
and
the
very
same
stone
still
lay
at
my
feet
however
often
i
might
pick
it
up
and
throw
it
illustration
no
waking
joy
in
the
world
can
give
can
equal
in
intensity
these
complex
joys
i
had
when
asleep
waking
joys
seem
so
slight
so
vague
in
comparison
so
much
escapes
the
senses
through
lack
of
concentration
and
undivided
attention
the
waking
perceptions
are
so
blunt
it
was
a
life
within
a
life
an
intenser
life
in
which
the
fresh
perceptions
of
childhood
combined
with
the
magic
of
and
in
which
there
was
but
one
unsatisfied
longing
but
its
name
was
lion
it
was
the
passionate
longing
to
meet
the
duchess
of
towers
once
more
in
that
land
of
dreams
thus
for
a
time
i
went
on
more
solitary
than
ever
but
well
compensated
for
all
my
loneliness
by
this
strange
new
life
that
had
opened
itself
to
me
and
never
ceasing
to
marvel
and
rejoice
when
one
morning
i
received
a
note
from
lady
cray
who
wanted
some
stables
built
at
cray
their
in
hertfordshire
and
begged
i
would
go
there
for
the
day
and
night
i
was
bound
to
accept
this
invitation
as
a
mere
matter
of
business
of
course
as
a
friend
lady
cray
seemed
to
have
dropped
me
long
ago
like
a
potato
blissfully
unconscious
that
it
was
i
who
had
dropped
her
but
she
received
me
as
a
friend
an
old
friend
all
my
shyness
and
snobbery
fell
from
me
at
the
mere
touch
of
her
hand
i
had
arrived
at
cray
early
in
the
afternoon
and
had
immediately
set
about
my
work
which
took
several
hours
so
that
i
got
to
the
house
only
just
in
time
to
dress
for
dinner
when
i
came
into
the
there
were
several
people
there
and
lady
cray
presented
me
to
a
young
lady
the
vicar
daughter
whom
i
was
to
take
in
to
dinner
i
was
very
much
impressed
on
being
told
by
her
that
the
company
assembled
in
the
included
no
less
a
person
than
sir
edwin
landseer
many
years
ago
i
had
copied
an
engraving
of
one
of
his
pictures
for
mimsey
seraskier
it
was
called
the
challenge
or
coming
events
cast
their
shadows
before
them
i
feasted
my
eyes
on
the
wondrous
little
man
who
seemed
extremely
chatty
and
genial
and
quite
unembarrassed
by
his
fame
a
guest
was
late
and
lord
cray
who
seemed
somewhat
peevishly
impatient
for
his
food
exclaimed
mary
would
be
mary
if
she
were
punctual
just
then
mary
came
in
and
mary
was
no
less
a
person
than
the
duchess
of
towers
my
knees
trembled
under
me
but
there
was
no
time
to
give
way
to
any
such
tender
weakness
lord
cray
walked
away
with
her
the
procession
filed
into
the
dining
room
and
somewhere
at
the
end
of
it
my
young
vicaress
and
myself
the
duchess
sat
a
long
way
from
me
but
i
met
her
glance
for
a
moment
and
fancied
i
saw
again
in
it
that
glimmer
of
kindly
recognition
my
neighbor
who
was
charming
asked
me
if
i
did
not
think
the
duchess
of
towers
the
most
beautiful
woman
i
had
ever
seen
i
assented
with
right
and
was
told
that
she
was
as
good
as
she
was
beautiful
and
as
clever
as
she
was
good
as
if
i
did
not
know
it
that
she
would
give
away
the
very
clothes
off
her
back
that
there
was
no
trouble
she
would
not
take
for
others
that
she
did
not
get
on
well
with
her
husband
who
drank
and
was
altogether
bad
and
vile
that
she
had
a
great
sorrow
an
only
child
an
idiot
to
whom
she
was
devoted
and
who
would
some
day
be
the
duke
of
towers
that
she
was
highly
accomplished
a
great
linguist
a
great
musician
and
about
the
most
popular
woman
in
all
english
society
ah
who
loved
the
duchess
of
towers
better
than
this
poor
scribe
in
whose
soul
she
lived
and
shone
like
a
bright
particular
star
like
the
sun
and
who
without
his
knowing
was
being
rapidly
drawn
into
the
sphere
of
her
attraction
as
lintot
called
it
one
day
to
be
finally
absorbed
i
trust
forever
and
who
was
this
wonderful
duchess
of
towers
before
she
married
i
asked
she
was
a
miss
seraskier
her
father
was
a
hungarian
a
physician
and
a
political
reformer
a
most
charming
person
that
where
she
gets
her
manners
her
mother
whom
she
lost
when
she
was
quite
a
child
was
a
very
beautiful
irish
girl
of
good
family
a
first
cousin
of
lord
cray
a
miss
desmond
who
ran
away
with
the
interesting
patriot
they
lived
somewhere
near
paris
it
was
there
that
madame
seraskier
died
of
cholera
what
is
the
matter
are
you
ill
illustration
i
made
out
that
i
was
faint
from
the
heat
and
concealed
as
well
as
i
could
the
flood
of
emotion
and
bewilderment
that
overwhelmed
me
i
dared
not
look
again
at
the
duchess
of
towers
oh
little
mimsey
dear
with
your
poor
thin
arms
round
my
neck
and
your
cold
pale
cheek
against
mine
i
felt
them
there
only
last
night
to
have
grown
into
such
a
splendid
vision
of
female
health
and
strength
and
beauty
as
this
with
that
enchanting
laugh
and
smile
why
of
course
those
eyes
so
lashless
then
so
thickly
fringed
how
could
i
have
mistaken
them
ah
mimsey
you
never
smiled
or
laughed
in
those
days
or
i
should
have
known
your
eyes
again
is
it
possible
is
it
possible
thus
i
went
on
to
myself
till
the
ladies
left
my
fair
young
companion
expressing
her
kind
anxiety
and
polite
hope
that
i
would
soon
be
myself
again
i
sat
silent
till
it
was
time
to
join
the
ladies
i
could
not
even
follow
the
witty
and
brilliant
anecdotes
of
the
great
painter
who
held
the
table
and
then
i
went
up
to
my
room
i
could
not
face
again
so
soon
after
what
i
had
heard
the
good
lord
cray
came
to
make
kind
inquiries
but
i
soon
satisfied
him
that
my
indisposition
was
nothing
he
stayed
on
however
and
talked
his
dinner
seemed
to
have
done
him
a
great
deal
of
good
and
he
wanted
to
smoke
and
somebody
to
smoke
with
which
he
had
not
been
able
to
do
in
the
on
account
of
some
reverend
old
bishop
who
was
present
so
he
rolled
himself
a
little
cigarette
like
a
frenchman
and
puffed
away
to
his
heart
content
he
little
guessed
how
his
humble
architect
wished
him
away
until
he
began
to
talk
of
the
duchess
of
towers
mary
towers
as
he
called
her
and
to
tell
me
how
towers
deserved
to
be
kicked
and
whipped
at
the
cart
tail
why
she
the
best
and
most
beautiful
woman
in
england
and
as
sharp
as
a
needle
if
it
had
been
for
her
he
have
been
in
the
bankruptcy
court
long
ago
etc
there
not
a
duchess
in
england
that
fit
to
hold
the
candle
to
her
either
for
looks
or
brains
or
breedin
either
her
mother
the
loveliest
woman
that
ever
lived
except
mary
was
a
connection
of
mine
that
where
she
gets
her
manners
etc
thus
did
this
noble
earl
make
music
for
me
sweet
and
bitter
music
mary
it
is
a
heavenly
name
especially
on
english
lips
and
spelled
in
the
english
mode
with
the
adorable
great
men
have
had
a
passion
for
it
byron
shelley
burns
but
none
methinks
a
greater
passion
than
i
nor
with
such
good
cause
and
yet
there
must
be
a
bad
mary
now
and
then
here
or
there
and
even
an
ugly
one
indeed
there
was
once
a
bloody
mary
who
was
both
it
seems
incredible
mary
indeed
why
not
hecuba
for
what
was
i
to
the
duchess
of
towers
when
i
was
alone
again
i
went
to
bed
and
tried
to
sleep
on
my
back
with
my
arms
up
in
the
hope
of
a
true
dream
but
sleep
would
not
come
and
i
passed
a
white
night
as
the
french
say
i
rose
early
and
walked
about
the
park
and
tried
to
interest
my
self
in
the
stables
till
it
was
nobody
was
up
and
i
breakfasted
alone
with
lady
cray
who
was
as
kind
as
she
could
be
i
do
not
think
she
could
have
found
me
a
very
witty
companion
and
then
i
went
back
to
the
stables
to
think
and
fell
into
a
doze
at
about
twelve
i
heard
the
sound
of
wooden
balls
and
found
a
lawn
where
some
people
were
playing
croquet
it
was
quite
a
new
game
and
a
few
years
later
became
the
fashion
illustration
sweet
and
bitter
music
i
sat
down
under
a
large
close
to
the
lawn
it
was
like
a
tent
with
chairs
and
tables
underneath
presently
lady
cray
came
there
with
the
duchess
of
towers
i
wanted
to
fly
but
was
rooted
to
the
spot
illustration
the
introduction
lady
cray
presented
me
and
almost
immediately
a
servant
came
with
a
message
for
her
and
i
was
left
with
the
one
woman
in
the
world
my
heart
was
in
my
mouth
my
throat
was
dry
my
pulse
was
beating
in
my
temples
she
asked
me
in
the
most
natural
manner
if
i
played
croquet
yes
no
at
least
sometimes
that
is
i
never
of
it
oh
i
forget
i
groaned
at
my
idiocy
and
hid
my
face
in
my
hands
she
asked
if
i
were
still
unwell
and
i
said
no
and
then
she
began
to
talk
quite
easily
about
anything
everything
till
i
felt
more
at
my
ease
her
voice
i
had
never
heard
it
well
but
in
a
dream
and
it
was
the
same
a
very
rich
and
modulated
voice
low
contralto
with
many
varied
and
delightful
inflexions
and
she
used
more
action
in
speaking
than
the
generality
of
englishwomen
thereby
reminding
me
of
madame
seraskier
i
noticed
that
her
hands
were
long
and
very
narrow
and
also
her
feet
and
remembered
that
mimsey
were
like
that
they
were
considered
poor
mimsey
only
beauty
i
also
noticed
an
almost
imperceptible
scar
on
her
left
temple
and
remembered
with
a
thrill
that
i
had
noticed
it
in
my
dream
as
we
walked
up
the
avenue
together
in
waking
life
i
had
never
been
near
enough
to
her
to
notice
a
small
scar
and
mimsey
had
no
scar
of
the
kind
in
the
old
days
of
that
i
felt
sure
for
i
had
seen
much
of
mimsey
lately
i
grew
more
accustomed
to
the
situation
and
ventured
to
say
that
i
had
once
met
her
at
lady
cray
in
london
oh
yes
i
remember
giulia
grisi
sand
the
song
and
then
she
crinkled
up
her
eyes
and
laughed
and
blushed
and
went
on
i
noticed
you
standing
in
a
corner
under
the
famous
gainsborough
you
reminded
me
of
a
dear
little
french
boy
i
once
knew
who
was
very
kind
to
me
when
i
was
a
little
girl
in
france
and
whose
father
you
happen
to
be
like
but
i
found
that
you
were
ibbetson
an
english
architect
and
lady
cray
tells
me
a
very
rising
one
i
a
little
french
boy
once
i
had
to
change
my
name
to
please
a
relative
and
become
english
that
is
i
was
always
english
you
know
good
heavens
what
an
extraordinary
thing
what
your
name
then
pasquier
i
groaned
and
the
tears
came
into
my
eyes
and
i
looked
away
the
duchess
made
no
answer
and
when
i
turned
and
looked
at
her
she
was
looking
at
me
very
pale
her
lips
quite
white
her
hands
tightly
clasped
in
her
lap
and
trembling
all
over
i
said
you
used
to
be
little
mimsey
seraskier
and
i
used
to
carry
you
pickaback
oh
do
oh
do
she
said
and
began
to
cry
i
got
up
and
walked
about
under
the
till
she
had
dried
her
eyes
the
were
intent
upon
their
game
i
again
sat
down
beside
her
she
had
dried
her
eyes
and
at
length
she
said
what
a
dreadful
thing
it
was
about
your
poor
father
and
mother
and
dear
mother
do
you
remember
her
she
died
a
week
after
you
left
i
went
to
russia
with
papa
seraskier
what
a
terrible
it
all
was
and
then
we
gradually
fell
to
talking
quite
naturally
about
old
times
and
dear
dead
people
she
never
took
her
eyes
off
mine
after
a
while
i
said
i
went
to
passy
and
found
everything
changed
and
built
over
it
nearly
drove
me
mad
to
see
i
went
to
st
cloud
and
saw
you
driving
with
the
empress
of
the
french
that
night
i
had
such
an
extraordinary
dream
i
dreamed
i
was
floundering
about
the
rue
de
la
pompe
and
had
just
got
to
the
avenue
gate
and
you
were
there
good
heavens
she
whispered
and
turned
white
again
and
trembled
all
over
what
do
you
mean
yes
i
said
you
came
to
my
rescue
i
was
pursued
by
gnomes
and
horrors
good
heavens
by
by
two
little
jailers
a
man
and
his
wife
who
danced
and
were
trying
to
hem
you
in
it
was
now
my
turn
to
ejaculate
good
heavens
we
both
shook
and
trembled
together
i
said
you
gave
me
your
hand
and
all
came
straight
at
once
my
old
school
rose
in
place
of
the
jail
with
a
yellow
omnibus
and
boys
going
off
to
their
communion
yes
and
there
was
a
crowd
le
père
et
la
mère
françois
and
madame
liard
the
grocer
wife
and
and
mimsey
seraskier
with
her
cropped
head
and
an
organ
was
playing
a
tune
i
knew
quite
well
but
can
not
now
recall
was
it
les
bateaux
oh
of
les
bateaux
qui
vont
sur
des
jambes
that
it
oui
petit
bêta
pas
ils
pas
she
sank
back
in
her
chair
pale
and
prostrate
after
a
while
and
then
i
gave
you
good
advice
about
how
to
dream
true
and
we
got
to
my
old
house
and
i
tried
to
make
you
read
the
letters
on
the
portico
and
you
read
them
wrong
and
i
laughed
yes
i
read
noire
was
it
idiotic
and
then
i
touched
you
again
and
you
read
notre
dame
yes
and
you
touched
me
and
i
read
sed
apta
small
but
fit
is
what
it
means
why
when
you
were
a
boy
you
told
me
was
all
one
word
and
was
the
latin
for
i
believed
it
ever
since
and
thought
sed
apta
meant
i
blush
for
my
bad
latin
after
this
you
gave
me
good
advice
again
about
not
touching
anything
or
picking
flowers
i
never
have
and
then
you
went
away
into
the
park
the
light
went
out
of
my
life
sleeping
or
waking
i
have
never
been
able
to
dream
of
you
since
i
do
suppose
i
shall
ever
meet
you
again
after
after
this
we
were
silent
for
a
long
time
though
i
hummed
and
hawed
now
and
then
and
tried
to
speak
i
was
sick
with
the
conflict
of
my
feelings
at
length
she
said
dear
ibbetson
this
is
all
so
extraordinary
that
i
must
go
away
and
think
it
all
over
i
can
not
tell
you
what
it
has
been
to
me
to
meet
you
once
more
and
that
double
dream
common
to
us
both
oh
i
am
dazed
beyond
expression
and
feel
as
if
i
were
dreaming
now
except
that
this
all
seems
so
unreal
and
impossible
so
untrue
we
had
better
part
now
i
do
know
if
i
shall
ever
meet
you
again
you
will
be
often
in
my
thoughts
but
never
in
my
dreams
again
that
at
least
i
can
command
nor
i
in
yours
it
must
not
be
my
poor
father
taught
me
how
to
dream
before
he
died
that
i
might
find
innocent
consolation
in
dreams
for
my
waking
troubles
which
are
many
and
great
as
his
were
if
i
can
see
that
any
good
may
come
of
it
i
will
write
but
no
you
must
not
expect
a
letter
i
will
now
say
and
leave
you
you
go
do
you
not
that
is
best
i
think
this
had
better
be
a
final
adieu
i
can
not
tell
you
of
what
interest
you
are
to
me
and
always
have
been
i
thought
you
had
died
long
ago
we
shall
often
think
of
each
other
that
is
inevitable
never
never
dream
that
will
not
dear
ibbetson
i
wish
you
all
the
good
that
one
human
being
can
wish
another
and
now
goodbye
and
may
god
in
heaven
bless
you
she
rose
trembling
and
white
and
her
eyes
wet
with
tears
and
wrung
both
my
hands
and
left
me
as
she
had
left
me
in
the
dream
the
light
went
out
of
my
life
and
i
was
once
more
alone
more
wretchedly
and
miserably
alone
than
if
i
had
never
met
her
i
went
back
to
pentonville
and
outwardly
took
up
the
thread
of
my
monotonous
existence
and
ate
drank
and
worked
and
went
about
as
usual
but
as
one
in
an
ordinary
dream
for
now
dreams
true
dreams
had
become
the
only
reality
for
me
illustration
a
farewell
so
great
so
inconceivable
and
unexampled
a
wonder
had
been
wrought
in
a
dream
that
all
the
conditions
of
life
had
been
altered
and
reversed
i
and
another
human
being
had
met
actually
and
really
met
in
a
double
dream
a
dream
common
to
us
both
and
clasped
each
other
hands
and
each
had
spoken
words
to
the
other
which
neither
ever
would
or
ever
could
forget
and
this
other
human
being
and
i
had
been
enshrined
in
each
memory
for
years
since
childhood
and
were
now
linked
together
by
a
tie
so
marvellous
an
experience
so
unprecedented
that
neither
could
ever
well
be
out
of
the
other
thoughts
as
long
as
life
and
sense
and
memory
lasted
her
very
self
as
we
talked
to
each
other
under
the
at
cray
was
less
vividly
present
to
me
than
that
other
and
still
dearer
self
of
hers
with
whom
i
had
walked
up
the
avenue
in
that
balmy
dream
atmosphere
where
we
had
lived
and
moved
and
had
our
being
together
for
a
few
short
moments
yet
each
believing
the
other
at
the
time
to
be
a
mere
figment
of
his
own
and
her
sleeping
imagination
such
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
of
and
lo
it
was
all
true
as
true
as
the
common
experience
of
life
more
ten
times
more
because
through
our
keener
and
more
exalted
sense
perceptions
and
less
divided
attention
we
were
more
conscious
of
each
other
real
inner
being
linked
closer
together
for
a
space
than
two
mortals
had
probably
ever
been
since
the
world
began
that
clasp
of
the
hands
in
the
dream
how
infinitely
more
it
had
conveyed
of
one
to
the
other
than
even
that
sad
farewell
clasp
at
cray
in
my
poor
outer
life
i
waited
in
vain
for
a
letter
in
vain
i
haunted
the
parks
and
streets
the
street
where
she
lived
in
the
hope
of
seeing
her
once
more
the
house
was
shut
she
was
away
in
america
as
i
afterwards
learned
with
her
husband
and
child
at
night
in
the
familiar
scenes
i
had
learned
so
well
to
conjure
up
i
explored
every
nook
and
corner
with
the
same
yearning
desire
to
find
a
trace
of
her
i
was
hardly
ever
away
from
parva
sed
apta
there
were
madame
seraskier
and
mimsey
and
the
major
and
my
mother
and
gogo
at
all
times
in
and
out
and
of
course
as
unconscious
of
my
solid
presence
as
though
i
had
never
existed
and
as
i
looked
at
mimsey
and
her
mother
i
wondered
at
my
obtuseness
in
not
recognizing
at
the
very
first
glance
who
the
duchess
of
towers
had
been
and
whose
daughter
the
height
the
voice
the
eyes
certain
tricks
of
gait
and
gesture
how
could
i
have
failed
to
know
her
again
after
such
recent
dream
opportunities
and
seraskier
towering
among
them
all
as
his
daughter
now
towered
among
women
i
saw
that
he
lived
again
in
his
daughter
was
the
smile
that
closed
up
the
eyes
as
hers
did
had
mimsey
ever
smiled
in
those
days
i
should
have
known
her
again
by
this
very
characteristic
trait
of
this
daughter
of
his
the
mimsey
of
the
past
years
not
the
duchess
of
i
never
now
could
have
enough
and
made
her
go
through
again
and
again
all
the
scenes
with
gogo
so
dear
to
my
remembrance
and
to
hers
i
was
in
fact
the
prince
charmant
of
whose
unseen
attendance
she
had
been
conscious
in
some
inconceivable
way
what
a
strange
foresight
but
where
was
the
fée
tarapatapoum
never
there
during
this
year
of
unutterable
longing
she
had
said
it
never
never
again
should
i
be
in
her
dream
or
she
in
mine
however
constantly
we
might
dwell
in
each
other
thoughts
so
sped
a
twelvemonth
after
that
last
meeting
in
the
flesh
at
gray
and
now
with
an
unwilling
heart
and
most
reluctant
pen
i
must
come
to
the
great
calamity
of
my
life
which
i
will
endeavor
to
tell
in
as
few
words
as
possible
the
reader
if
he
has
been
good
enough
to
read
without
skipping
will
remember
the
handsome
deane
to
whom
i
fancied
i
lost
my
heart
in
hopshire
a
few
years
back
i
had
not
seen
her
since
had
indeed
almost
forgotten
her
but
had
heard
vaguely
that
she
had
left
hopshire
and
come
to
london
and
married
a
wealthy
man
much
older
than
herself
well
one
day
i
was
in
hyde
park
gazing
at
the
people
in
the
drive
when
a
and
very
open
carriage
went
by
and
in
it
sad
deane
that
was
all
alone
in
her
glory
and
looking
very
sulky
indeed
she
recognized
me
and
bowed
and
i
bowed
back
again
with
just
a
moment
little
flutter
of
the
heart
an
involuntary
tribute
to
auld
lang
syne
and
went
on
my
way
wondering
that
i
could
ever
had
admired
her
so
presently
to
my
surprise
i
was
touched
on
the
elbow
it
was
deane
again
i
will
call
her
deane
still
she
had
got
out
and
followed
me
on
foot
it
was
her
wish
that
i
should
drive
round
the
park
with
her
and
talk
of
old
times
i
obeyed
and
for
the
first
and
last
time
found
myself
forming
part
of
that
proud
and
gay
procession
i
had
so
often
watched
with
curious
eyes
she
seemed
anxious
to
know
whether
i
had
ever
made
it
up
with
colonel
ibbetson
and
pleased
to
hear
that
i
had
not
and
that
i
probably
never
should
and
that
my
feeling
against
him
was
strong
and
bitter
and
likely
to
last
she
appeared
to
hate
him
very
much
she
inquired
kindly
after
myself
and
my
prospects
in
life
but
did
not
seem
deeply
interested
in
my
answers
until
later
when
i
talked
of
my
french
life
and
my
dear
father
and
mother
when
she
listened
with
eager
sympathy
and
i
was
much
touched
she
asked
if
i
had
portraits
of
them
i
had
most
excellent
miniatures
and
when
we
parted
i
had
promised
to
call
upon
her
next
afternoon
and
bring
these
miniatures
with
me
she
seemed
a
languid
woman
much
ennuyée
and
evidently
without
a
large
circle
of
acquaintance
she
told
me
i
was
the
only
person
in
the
whole
park
whom
she
had
bowed
to
that
day
her
husband
was
in
hamburg
and
she
was
going
to
meet
him
in
paris
in
a
day
or
two
i
had
not
so
many
friends
but
what
i
felt
rather
glad
than
otherwise
to
have
met
her
and
willingly
called
as
i
had
promised
with
the
portraits
she
lived
in
a
large
new
house
magnificently
up
near
the
marble
arch
she
was
quite
alone
when
i
called
and
asked
me
immediately
if
i
had
brought
the
miniatures
and
looked
at
them
quite
eagerly
and
then
at
me
and
exclaimed
good
heavens
you
are
your
father
very
image
indeed
i
had
always
been
considered
so
both
his
eyebrows
and
mine
especially
met
in
a
singular
and
characteristic
fashion
at
the
bridge
of
the
nose
and
she
seemed
much
struck
by
this
he
was
represented
in
the
uniform
of
charles
x
du
in
which
he
had
served
for
two
years
and
had
acquired
the
nickname
of
le
beau
pasquier
deane
seemed
never
to
tire
of
gazing
at
it
and
remarked
that
my
father
must
have
been
the
very
ideal
of
a
young
girl
dream
an
indirect
compliment
which
made
me
blush
after
what
she
had
just
said
of
the
likeness
between
us
i
almost
began
to
wonder
whether
she
was
going
to
try
and
make
a
fool
of
me
again
as
she
had
so
successfully
done
a
few
years
ago
then
she
became
interested
again
in
my
early
life
and
recollections
and
wanted
to
know
whether
my
parents
were
fond
of
each
other
they
were
a
most
devoted
and
pair
and
had
loved
each
other
at
first
sight
and
until
death
and
i
told
her
so
and
so
on
until
i
became
quite
excited
and
imagined
she
must
know
of
some
good
fortune
to
which
i
was
entitled
and
had
been
kept
out
of
by
the
machinations
of
a
wicked
uncle
for
i
had
long
discovered
in
my
dreams
that
he
had
been
my
bitterest
enemy
and
the
main
cause
of
his
financial
ruin
by
selfish
heartless
and
dishonest
deeds
too
complicated
to
explain
here
a
regular
shylock
i
had
found
this
out
by
listening
in
my
dreams
to
long
conversations
between
my
father
and
mother
in
the
old
at
passy
while
gogo
was
absorbed
in
his
book
and
every
word
that
had
passed
through
gogo
inattentive
ears
into
his
otherwise
preoccupied
little
brain
had
been
recorded
there
as
in
a
phonograph
and
was
now
repeated
over
and
over
again
for
peter
ibbetson
as
he
sat
unnoticed
among
them
i
asked
her
jokingly
if
she
had
discovered
that
i
was
the
rightful
heir
to
ibbetson
hall
by
any
chance
she
replied
that
nothing
would
give
her
greater
pleasure
but
there
was
no
such
good
fortune
in
store
for
either
her
or
me
that
she
had
discovered
long
ago
that
colonel
ibbetson
was
the
greatest
blackguard
unhung
and
nothing
new
she
might
discover
could
make
him
worse
i
then
remembered
how
he
would
often
speak
of
her
even
to
me
and
hint
and
insinuate
things
which
were
no
doubt
untrue
and
which
i
disbelieved
not
that
the
question
of
their
truth
or
untruth
made
him
any
the
less
despicable
and
vile
for
telling
she
asked
me
if
he
had
ever
spoken
of
her
to
me
and
after
much
persuasion
and
cunning
i
told
her
as
much
of
the
truth
as
i
dared
and
she
became
a
tigress
she
assured
me
that
he
had
managed
so
to
injure
and
compromise
her
in
hopshire
that
she
and
her
mother
had
to
leave
and
she
swore
to
me
most
solemnly
and
i
thoroughly
believe
she
spoke
the
truth
that
there
had
never
been
any
relation
between
them
that
she
could
not
have
owned
to
before
the
whole
world
she
had
wished
to
marry
him
it
is
true
for
his
wealth
and
position
for
both
she
and
her
mother
were
very
poor
and
often
hard
put
to
it
to
make
both
ends
meet
and
keep
up
a
decent
appearance
before
the
world
and
he
had
singled
her
out
and
paid
her
marked
attention
from
the
first
and
given
her
every
reason
to
believe
that
his
attentions
were
serious
and
honorable
at
this
juncture
her
mother
came
in
glyn
and
we
renewed
our
old
acquaintance
she
had
quite
forgiven
me
my
admiration
for
her
daughter
all
her
power
of
hating
like
her
daughter
had
concentrated
itself
on
ibbetson
and
as
i
listened
to
the
long
story
of
their
wrongs
and
his
infamy
i
grew
to
hate
him
worse
than
ever
and
was
ready
to
be
their
champion
on
the
spot
and
to
take
up
their
quarrel
there
and
then
but
this
would
not
do
it
appeared
for
their
name
must
nevermore
be
in
any
way
mixed
up
with
his
then
suddenly
glyn
asked
me
if
i
knew
when
he
went
to
india
i
could
satisfy
her
for
i
knew
that
it
was
just
after
my
marriage
nearly
a
year
before
my
birth
upon
which
she
gave
the
exact
date
of
his
departure
with
his
regiment
and
the
name
of
the
transport
and
everything
and
also
to
my
surprise
the
date
of
my
marriage
at
marylebone
church
and
of
my
baptism
there
fifteen
months
later
just
fourteen
weeks
after
my
birth
in
passy
i
was
growing
quite
bewildered
with
all
this
knowledge
of
my
affairs
and
wondered
more
and
more
we
sat
silent
for
a
while
the
two
women
looking
at
each
other
and
at
me
and
at
the
miniatures
it
was
getting
grewsome
what
could
it
all
mean
presently
glyn
at
a
nod
from
her
daughter
addressed
me
thus
ibbetson
your
uncle
as
you
call
him
though
he
is
not
your
uncle
is
a
very
terrible
villain
and
has
done
you
and
your
parents
a
very
foul
wrong
before
i
tell
you
what
it
is
and
i
think
you
ought
to
know
you
must
give
me
your
word
of
honor
that
you
will
do
or
say
nothing
that
will
get
our
name
publicly
mixed
up
in
any
way
with
colonel
ibbetson
the
injury
to
my
daughter
now
she
is
happily
married
to
an
excellent
man
would
be
irreparable
with
a
beating
heart
i
solemnly
gave
the
required
assurance
then
ibbetson
it
is
right
that
you
should
know
that
colonel
ibbetson
when
he
was
paying
his
infamous
addresses
to
my
daughter
gave
her
unmistakably
to
understand
that
you
were
his
natural
son
by
his
cousin
miss
catherine
biddulph
afterwards
madame
pasquier
de
la
marière
oh
oh
oh
i
cried
surely
you
must
be
mistaken
he
knew
it
was
impossible
he
had
been
refused
by
my
mother
three
times
he
went
to
india
nearly
a
year
before
i
was
born
he
then
deane
said
producing
an
old
letter
from
her
pocket
do
you
know
his
handwriting
and
his
crest
do
you
happen
to
recollect
once
bringing
me
a
note
from
at
ibbetson
hall
here
it
is
and
she
handed
it
to
me
it
was
unmistakably
his
and
i
remembered
it
at
once
and
this
is
what
it
said
for
heaven
sake
dear
friend
do
breathe
a
word
to
any
living
soul
of
what
you
were
clever
enough
to
guess
last
night
there
is
a
likeness
of
course
poor
antinoüs
he
is
quite
ignorant
of
the
true
relationship
which
has
caused
me
many
a
pang
of
shame
and
remorse
elle
était
ravissaure
we
were
cousins
much
thrown
together
were
so
young
and
one
so
beautiful
i
was
but
a
penniless
cornet
in
those
days
hardly
more
than
a
boy
happily
an
unsuspecting
frenchman
of
good
family
was
there
who
had
loved
her
long
and
she
married
him

can
you
forgive
me
this

i
have
repented
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
and
made
what
reparation
i
could
by
adopting
and
giving
my
name
to
one
who
is
a
perpetual
reminder
to
me
of
a
infatuation
he
little
knows
poor
boy
and
never
will

here
was
a
thunderbolt
out
of
the
blue
i
sat
stunned
and
saw
scarlet
and
felt
as
if
i
should
see
scarlet
forever
illustration
the
fatal
letter
after
a
long
silence
during
which
i
could
feel
my
pulse
beat
to
in
my
temples

said
now
ibbetson
i
hope
you
will
do
nothing
rash
nothing
that
can
bring
my
daughter
name
into
any
quarrel
between
yourself
and
your
uncle
for
the
sake
of
your
mother
good
name
you
will
be
prudent
i
know
if
he
could
speak
like
this
of
his
cousin
with
whom
he
had
been
in
love
when
he
was
young
what
lies
would
he
not
tell
of
my
poor
daughter
he
terrible
lies
oh
what
we
have
suffered
when
he
wrote
that
letter
i
believe
he
really
meant
to
marry
her
he
had
the
greatest
trust
in
her
or
he
would
never
have
committed
himself
so
foolishly
does
he
know
of
this
letter
existing
i
asked
no
when
he
and
my
daughter
quarrelled
she
sent
him
back
his
letters
all
but
this
one
which
she
told
him
she
had
burned
immediately
after
reading
it
as
he
had
told
her
to
do
may
i
keep
it
yes
i
know
you
may
be
trusted
and
my
daughter
name
has
been
removed
from
the
outside
as
you
see
no
one
but
ourselves
has
ever
seen
it
nor
have
we
mentioned
to
a
soul
what
it
contains
as
we
never
believed
it
for
a
moment
two
or
three
years
ago
we
had
the
curiosity
to
find
out
when
and
where
your
parents
had
married
and
when
you
were
born
and
when
went
to
india
it
was
no
surprise
to
us
at
all
we
then
tried
to
find
you
but
soon
gave
it
up
and
thought
it
better
to
leave
matters
alone
then
we
heard
he
was
in
mischief
again
just
the
same
sort
of
mischief
and
then
my
daughter
saw
you
in
the
park
and
we
concluded
you
ought
to
know
such
was
the
gist
of
that
memorable
conversation
which
i
have
condensed
as
much
as
i
could
when
i
left
these
two
ladies
i
walked
twice
rapidly
round
the
park
i
saw
scarlet
often
during
that
walk
perhaps
i
looked
scarlet
i
remember
people
staring
at
me
then
i
went
straight
to
lintot
with
the
impulse
to
tell
him
my
trouble
and
ask
his
advice
he
was
away
from
home
and
i
waited
in
his
for
a
while
reading
the
letter
over
and
over
again
then
i
decided
not
to
tell
him
and
left
the
house
taking
with
me
as
i
did
so
but
without
any
definite
purpose
a
heavy
loaded
stick
a
most
formidable
weapon
even
in
the
hands
of
a
boy
and
which
i
myself
had
given
to
lintot
on
his
last
birthday
greek
anagkae
then
i
went
to
my
usual
near
the
circus
and
dined
to
the
surprise
of
the
i
drank
a
quart
of
bitter
ale
and
two
glasses
of
sherry
it
was
my
custom
to
drink
water
she
plied
me
with
questions
as
to
whether
i
was
ill
or
in
trouble
i
answered
her
no
and
at
last
begged
she
would
leave
me
alone
ibbetson
lived
in
james
street
i
went
there
he
was
out
it
was
nine
and
his
servant
seemed
uncertain
when
he
would
return
i
came
back
at
ten
he
was
not
yet
home
and
the
servant
after
thinking
a
while
and
looking
up
and
down
the
street
and
finding
my
appearance
decent
and
by
no
means
dangerous
asked
me
to
go
upstairs
and
wait
as
i
told
him
it
was
a
matter
of
great
importance
so
i
went
and
sat
in
my
uncle
and
waited
the
servant
came
with
me
and
lit
the
candles
and
remarked
on
the
weather
and
handed
me
the
and
i
must
have
looked
quite
natural
as
i
tried
to
look
and
he
left
me
i
saw
a
malay
creese
on
the
and
hid
it
behind
a
i
locked
a
door
leading
to
another
where
there
was
a
grand
piano
and
above
it
a
trophy
of
swords
daggers
and
put
the
key
in
my
pocket
the
key
of
the
room
where
i
waited
was
inside
the
door
all
this
time
i
had
a
vague
idea
of
possible
violence
on
his
part
but
no
idea
of
killing
him
i
felt
far
too
strong
for
that
indeed
i
had
a
feeling
of
quiet
irresistible
strength
the
result
of
suppressed
excitement
i
sat
down
and
meditated
all
i
would
say
i
had
settled
it
over
and
over
again
and
read
and
reread
the
fatal
letter
the
servant
came
up
with
glasses
and
i
trembled
lest
he
should
observe
that
the
door
to
the
other
room
was
locked
but
he
did
not
he
opened
the
window
and
looked
up
and
down
the
street
presently
he
said
here
the
colonel
at
last
sir
and
went
down
to
open
the
door
i
heard
him
come
in
and
speak
to
his
servant
then
he
came
straight
up
humming
la
donna
e
mobile
and
walked
in
with
just
the
jaunty
airy
manner
i
remembered
he
was
in
evening
dress
and
very
little
changed
he
seemed
much
surprised
to
see
me
and
turned
very
white
well
my
apollo
of
the
t
square
cet
honneur
have
you
come
like
a
dutiful
nephew
to
humble
yourself
and
beg
for
forgiveness
i
forgot
all
i
meant
to
say
indeed
nothing
happened
as
i
had
meant
but
rose
and
said
i
have
come
to
have
a
talk
with
you
as
quietly
as
i
could
though
with
a
thick
voice
he
seemed
uneasy
and
went
towards
the
door
i
got
there
before
him
and
closed
it
and
locked
it
and
put
the
key
in
my
pocket
he
darted
to
the
other
door
and
found
it
locked
then
he
went
to
the
and
looked
for
the
creese
and
not
finding
it
he
turned
round
with
his
back
to
the
fireplace
and
his
arms
akimbo
and
tried
to
look
very
contemptuous
and
determined
his
chin
was
quite
white
under
his
dyed
mustache
like
wax
and
his
eyes
blinked
nervously
i
walked
up
to
him
and
said
you
told
deane
that
i
was
your
natural
son
it
a
lie
who
told
you
so
she
did
this
afternoon
it
a
lie
a
spiteful
invention
of
a
mistress
she
never
was
your
mistress
you
fool
i
suppose
she
told
you
that
too
leave
the
room
you
pitiful
green
jackass
or
i
have
you
turned
out
and
he
rang
the
bell
do
you
know
your
own
handwriting
i
said
and
handed
him
the
letter
he
read
a
line
or
two
and
gasped
out
that
it
was
a
forgery
and
rang
the
bell
again
and
looked
again
behind
the
clock
for
his
creese
then
he
lit
the
letter
at
a
candle
and
threw
it
in
the
fireplace
where
it
blazed
out
i
made
no
attempt
to
prevent
him
the
servant
tried
to
open
the
door
and
ibbetson
went
to
the
window
and
called
out
for
the
police
i
rushed
to
the
picture
where
i
had
hidden
the
creese
and
threw
it
on
the
table
then
i
swung
him
away
from
the
window
by
his
and
told
him
to
defend
himself
pointing
to
the
creese
he
seized
it
and
stood
on
the
defensive
the
servant
had
apparently
run
for
assistance
now
then
i
said
down
on
your
knees
you
infamous
cur
and
confess
it
your
only
chance
confess
what
you
fool
that
you
a
coward
and
a
liar
that
you
wrote
that
letter
that
deane
was
no
more
your
mistress
than
my
mother
was
there
was
a
sound
of
people
running
he
listened
a
moment
and
hissed
out
they
were
you
idiot
how
can
i
tell
for
certain
whether
you
are
my
son
or
not
it
all
comes
to
the
same
of
course
i
wrote
the
letter
come
on
you
cowardly
assassin
you
bastard
parricide
and
he
advanced
on
me
with
his
creese
low
down
in
his
right
hand
the
point
upward
and
made
a
thrust
shrieking
out
break
open
the
door
quick
they
did
but
too
late

bastard
parricide
i
saw
crimson
he
missed
me
and
i
brought
down
my
stick
on
his
left
arm
which
he
held
over
his
head
and
then
on
his
head
and
he
fell
crying
o
my
god
o
christ
i
struck
him
again
on
his
head
as
he
was
falling
and
once
again
when
he
was
on
the
ground
it
seemed
to
crash
right

for

they
say
a
sicilian
during
the
french
occupation
of
palermo
was
sentenced
to
be
shot
he
was
a
coward
and
it
was
feared
he
would
disgrace
his
country
at
the
last
moment
in
the
presence
of
the
french
soldiers
who
had
a
way
of
being
shot
with
a
good
grace
and
a
light
heart
they
had
grown
accustomed
to
it
for
the
honor
of
sicily
his
confessor
told
him
in
the
strictest
confidence
that
his
sentence
was
a
mock
one
and
that
he
would
be
fired
at
with
blank
cartridges
it
was
a
pious
fraud
all
but
two
of
the
twelve
cartridges
had
bullets
and
he
fell
riddled
through
and
through
no
frenchman
ever
died
with
a
lighter
heart
a
better
grace
he
was
superb
and
the
national
honor
was
saved

happy

if
the
story
be
true
that
trust
in
blank
cartridges
was

it
is

him
up

may
not

gallows
repent
yes
of
many
things
but
of
the
thing
for
which
i
am
here
never
it
is
a
ghastly
thing
to
be
judge
and
jury
and
executioner
all
in

for
a
private

personal
wrong
to
condemn

comes

the

do

was

went

he
shrieked
it
will
ring
in
my
heart

my

till
i

till
i
die
there
was
no
time
to
lose
no
time
to
think
for
the
best
it
is
all
for
the
best
as
it
is
what
might
he
not
have
said
if
he
had
lived
thank
heaven
pity
is
not
remorse
or
shame
and
what
crime
could
well
be
worse
than
his
to
rob
one
dearly
beloved
dead
of
their
fair
shame
he
might
have
been
mad
perhaps
and
have
grown
in
time
to
believe
the
lies
he
told
himself
such
things
have
been
but
such
a
madman
should
no
more
be
suffered
to
live
than
a
mad
dog
the
only
way
to
kill
the
lie
was
to
kill
the
liar
that
is
if
one
ever
kill
a
lie
poor
worm
after
all
he
could
not
help
it
i
suppose
he
was
like

was

by
such
monotonous
thoughts
and
others
as
dreary
and
hopeless
recurring
again
and
again
in
the
same
dull
round
i
beguiled
the
terrible
time
that
intervened
between
ibbetson
death
and
my
trial
at
the
old
bailey
it
all
seems
very
trivial
and
unimportant
now
not
worth
recording
even
hard
to
remember
but
at
the
time
my
misery
was
so
great
my
terror
of
the
gallows
so
poignant
that
each
day
i
thought
i
must
die
of
sheer
grief
before
another
hours
could
possibly
pass
over
me
the
intolerable
strain
would
grow
more
and
more
severe
till
a
climax
of
tension
was
reached
and
a
hysterical
burst
of
tears
would
relieve
me
for
a
while
and
i
would
feel
reconciled
to
my
fate
and
able
to
face
death
like
a
man
then
the
anguish
would
gradually
steal
over
me
again
and
the
uncontrollable
weakness
of
the
flesh
and
each
of
these
two
opposite
moods
while
it
lasted
made
the
other
seem
impossible
and
as
if
it
never
could
come
back
again
yet
back
it
came
with
the
regularity
of
a
tide
the
most
harrowing
seesaw
that
ever
was
i
had
always
been
unstable
like
that
but
whereas
i
had
hitherto
oscillated
between
high
elation
and
despondency
it
was
now
from
a
dumb
resigned
despair
to
the
wildest
agony
and
terror
i
sought
in
vain
for
the
only
comfort
it
was
in
me
to
seek
but
when
overdone
with
suffering
i
fell
asleep
at
last
i
could
no
longer
dream
true
i
could
dream
only
as
other
wretches
dream
i
always
dreamed
those
two
little
dancing
deformed
jailers
man
and
wife
had
got
me
at
last
and
that
i
shrieked
aloud
for
my
beloved
duchess
to
succor
me
as
they
ran
me
in
each
butting
at
me
sideways
and
showing
their
toothless
gums
in
a
black
smile
and
poisoning
me
with
their
hot
sour
breath
the
gate
was
there
and
the
avenue
all
distorted
and
quite
unlike
and
opposite
a
jail
but
no
powerful
duchess
of
towers
to
wave
the
horror
away
it
will
be
remembered
by
some
perhaps
how
short
was
my
trial
the
plea
of
not
guilty
was
entered
for
me
the
defence
set
up
was
insanity
based
on
the
absence
of
any
adequate
motive
this
defence
was
soon
disposed
of
by
the
prosecution
witnesses
to
my
sanity
were
not
wanting
and
motives
enough
were
found
in
my
past
relations
with
colonel
ibbetson
to
make
me
a
violent
morose
and
man
imbrue
my
hands
in
the
gore
of
my
relative
and
benefactor
a
man
old
enough
to
be
my
father
who
indeed
might
have
been
my
father
for
the
love
he
had
bestowed
upon
me
with
his
honored
name
when
i
was
left
a
penniless
foreign
orphan
on
his
hands
here
i
laughed
loud
and
long
and
made
a
most
painful
impression
as
is
duly
recorded
in
the
reports
of
the
trial
the
jury
found
me
guilty
quite
early
in
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
without
leaving
the
box
and
i
preserving
to
the
last
the
callous
and
unmoved
demeanor
i
had
borne
all
through
the
trial
was
duly
sentenced
to
death
without
any
hope
of
mercy
but
with
an
expression
of
regret
on
the
part
of
the
judge
a
famous
hanging
judge
that
a
man
of
my
education
and
promise
should
be
brought
by
his
own
evil
nature
and
uncontrollable
passions
to
so
deplorable
an
end
now
whether
the
worst
of
certainties
is
better
than
suspense
whether
my
nerves
of
pain
had
been
so
exercised
during
the
period
preceding
my
trial
that
i
had
really
become
callous
as
they
say
a
man
back
does
after
a
certain
number
of
strokes
from
the
cat
certain
it
was
that
i
knew
the
worst
and
acquiesced
in
it
with
a
surprised
sense
of
actual
relief
and
found
it
in
me
to
feel
it
not
unbearable
such
at
least
was
my
mood
that
night
i
made
the
most
of
it
it
was
almost
happiness
by
comparison
with
what
i
had
gone
through
i
remember
eating
with
a
heartiness
that
surprised
me
i
could
have
gone
straight
from
my
dinner
to
the
gallows
and
died
with
a
light
heart
and
a
good
grace
like
a
sicilian
i
resolved
to
write
the
whole
true
story
to
the
duchess
of
towers
with
an
avowal
of
my
long
and
hopeless
adoration
for
her
and
the
expression
of
a
hope
that
she
would
try
to
think
of
me
only
as
her
old
playfellow
and
as
she
had
known
me
before
this
terrible
disaster
and
thinking
of
the
letter
i
would
write
till
very
late
i
fell
asleep
in
my
cell
with
two
warders
to
watch
over
me
and
then
another
phase
of
my
inner
life
began
without
effort
without
let
or
hindrance
of
any
kind
i
was
at
the
avenue
gate
the
pink
and
white
may
the
lilacs
and
laburnums
were
in
full
bloom
the
sun
made
golden
paths
everywhere
the
warm
air
was
full
of
fragrance
and
alive
with
all
the
buzz
and
chirp
of
early
summer
i
was
half
crying
with
joy
to
reach
the
land
of
my
true
dreams
again
to
feel
at
home

the
facetious
postman
yverdon
went
in
at
the
gate
of
my
old
garden
the
bell
rang
as
he
pushed
it
and
i
followed
him
under
the
which
was
putting
forth
shoots
of

in
profusion
sat
my

and
monsieur

took

from

said

and
paid

it
was
from

then
in

and
not

lay
snoring
on
the

and
gogo
and
mimsey
were
looking
at
the
pictures
in

a

chair
lolled

apparently
asleep
with
his
long
porcelain
pipe
across
his

madame

in
a
yellow

with
gigot
sleeves
was
cutting
out
of
the

gazed
on
them
all
with
unutterable
tenderness
i
was
gazing
on
them
perhaps
for
the
last
time
i
called
out
to
them
by
name
oh
speak
to
me
beloved
shades
oh
my
father
oh
mother
i
want
you
so
desperately
come
out
of
the
past
for
a
few
seconds
and
give
me
some
words
of
comfort
i
in
such
woful
plight
if
you
could
only
but
they
could
neither
hear
nor
see
me
then
suddenly
another
figure
stepped
forth
from
behind
the
no
unsubstantial
shadow
of
days
that
one
can
only
see
and
hear
and
that
can
not
hear
and
see
one
back
again
but
one
in
all
the
splendid
fulness
of
life
a
pillar
of
help
and
strength
mary
duchess
of
towers
i
fell
on
my
knees
as
she
came
to
me
with
both
hands
extended
oh
ibbetson
i
have
been
seeking
and
waiting
for
you
here
night
after
night
i
have
been
frantic
if
you
had
come
at
last
i
must
have
thrown
everything
to
the
winds
and
gone
to
see
you
in
newgate
waking
and
before
the
world
to
have
a
talk
with
you
an
i
suppose
you
could
sleep
or
were
unable
to
dream
i
could
not
answer
at
first
i
could
only
cover
her
hands
with
kisses
as
i
felt
her
warm
mixing
with
mine
a
rapture
and
then
i
said
i
swear
to
you
by
all
i
hold
most
sacred
by
mother
memory
and
by
yourself
that
i
never
meant
to
take
ibbetson
life
or
even
strike
him
the
miserable
blow
was
dealt
as
if
you
need
tell
me
that
as
if
i
did
know
you
of
old
my
poor
friend
kindest
and
gentlest
of
men
why
i
am
holding
your
hands
and
see
into
the
very
depths
of
your
heart
i
put
down
all
she
said
as
she
said
it
of
course
i
am
not
and
never
have
been
what
her
old
affectionate
regard
made
me
seem
in
her
eyes
any
more
than
i
am
the
bloodthirsty
monster
i
passed
for
she
was
the
slave
of
her
predilections
and
now
ibbetson
she
went
on
let
me
first
of
all
tell
you
for
a
certainty
that
the
sentence
will
be
commuted
i
saw
the
home
secretary
three
or
four
hours
ago
the
real
cause
of
your
deplorable
quarrel
with
your
uncle
is
an
open
secret
his
character
is
well
known
a
gregory
whom
you
knew
in
hopshire
as
deane
has
been
with
the
home
secretary
this
afternoon
your
chivalrous
reticence
at
the
trial
oh
i
interrupted
i
do
care
to
live
any
longer
now
that
i
have
met
you
once
more
and
that
you
have
forgiven
me
and
think
well
of
me
in
spite
of
everything
i
am
ready
to
die
there
has
never
been
anybody
but
you
in
the
world
for
never
a
ghost
of
a
woman
never
even
a
friend
since
my
mother
died
and
yours
between
that
time
and
the
night
i
first
saw
you
at
lady
cray
concert
i
can
scarcely
be
said
to
have
lived
at
all
i
fed
on
scraps
of
remembrance
you
see
i
have
no
talent
for
making
new
friends
but
oh
such
a
genius
for
fidelity
to
old
ones
i
was
waiting
for
mimsey
to
come
back
again
i
suppose
the
one
survivor
to
me
of
that
sweet
time
and
when
she
came
at
last
i
was
too
stupid
to
recognize
her
she
suddenly
blazed
and
dazzled
into
my
poor
life
like
a
meteor
and
filled
it
with
a
maddening
love
and
pain
i
do
know
which
of
the
two
has
been
the
sweetest
both
have
been
my
life
you
can
not
realize
what
it
has
been
trust
me
i
have
lived
my
fill
i
am
ready
and
willing
to
die
it
is
the
only
perfect
consummation
i
can
think
of
nothing
can
ever
equal
this
moment
nothing
on
earth
or
in
heaven
and
if
i
were
free
life
would
not
be
worth
having
without
i
would
not
take
it
as
a
gift
she
sat
down
by
me
on
the
grass
with
her
hands
clasped
across
her
knees
close
to
the
unconscious
shadows
of
our
kith
and
kin
within
hearing
of
their
happy
talk
and
laughter
suddenly
we
both
heard
mimsey
say
to
gogo
o
ils
sont
joliment
bien
ensemble
le
prince
charmant
et
la
fée
tarapatapoum
we
looked
at
each
other
and
actually
laughed
aloud
the
duchess
said
was
there
ever
since
the
world
began
such
a
en
and
for
such
a
meeting
ibbetson
think
of
it
conceive
it
arranged
it
all
i
chose
a
day
when
they
were
all
together
as
they
would
say
in
america
am
the
boss
of
this
particular
dream
and
she
laughed
again
through
her
tears
that
enchanting
ripple
of
a
laugh
that
closed
her
eyes
and
made
her
so
irresistible
was
there
ever
said
i
ever
since
the
world
began
such
ecstasy
as
i
feel
now
after
this
what
can
there
be
for
me
but
death
well
earned
and
well
paid
for
welcome
and
lovely
death
illustration
you
have
not
yet
thought
ibbetson
you
have
not
realized
what
life
may
have
in
store
for
you
if
if
all
you
have
said
about
your
affection
for
me
is
true
oh
it
is
too
terrible
for
me
to
think
of
i
know
that
you
scarcely
more
than
a
boy
should
have
to
spend
the
rest
of
your
life
in
miserable
confinement
and
unprofitable
monotonous
toil
but
there
is
side
to
that
picture
now
listen
to
your
old
friend
story
poor
little
mimsey
confession
i
will
make
it
as
short
as
i
can
do
you
remember
when
you
first
saw
me
a
sickly
plain
sad
little
girl
at
the
avenue
gate
twenty
years
ago
le
père
françois
was
killing
a
fowl
cutting
its
throat
with
a
and
the
poor
thing
struggled
frantically
in
his
grasp
as
its
blood
flowed
into
the
gutter
a
group
of
boys
were
looking
on
in
great
glee
and
all
the
while
père
françois
was
gossiping
with
le
curé
who
did
seem
to
mind
in
the
least
i
was
fainting
with
pity
and
horror
suddenly
you
came
out
of
the
school
opposite
with
alfred
and
charlie
plunket
and
saw
it
all
and
in
a
fit
of
noble
rage
you
called
père
françois
a
pig
of
assassin
which
as
you
know
is
very
rude
in
french
and
struck
him
as
near
his
face
as
you
could
reach
have
you
forgotten
that
ah
have
it
was
not
an
effectual
deed
perhaps
and
certainly
came
too
late
to
save
the
fowl
besides
père
françois
struck
you
back
again
and
left
some
of
the
fowl
blood
on
your
cheek
it
was
a
baptism
you
became
on
the
spot
my
hero
my
angel
of
light
look
at
gogo
over
there
is
he
beautiful
enough
that
was
ibbetson
le
curé
said
something
about
who
go
mad
if
a
man
whips
his
horse
and
yet
pay
people
to
box
each
other
to
death
you
really
remember
oh
the
recollection
to
and
that
little
language
we
invented
and
used
to
talk
so
fluently
do
you
it
to
yourself
le
tu
pas
as
we
would
have
said
in
those
days
for
it
used
to
be
and
with
us
then
well
at
all
events
you
must
remember
how
for
five
happy
years
we
were
so
often
together
how
you
drew
for
me
read
to
me
played
with
me
took
my
part
in
everything
right
or
wrong
carried
me
pickaback
when
i
was
tired
your
drawings
i
have
them
all
and
oh
you
were
so
funny
sometimes
how
you
used
to
make
mamma
laugh
and
le
major
just
look
at
gogo
again
have
you
forgotten
what
he
is
doing
now
i
have
he
has
just
changed
the
des
for
the
and
is
explaining
hogarth
pictures
of
the
and
industrious
apprentices
to
mimsey
and
they
are
both
agreed
that
the
idle
one
is
much
the
less
objectionable
of
the
two
mimsey
looks
passive
enough
with
her
thumb
in
her
mouth
does
she
her
little
heart
is
so
full
of
gratitude
and
love
for
gogo
that
she
ca
speak
she
can
only
suck
her
thumb
poor
sick
ungainly
child
she
would
like
to
be
gogo
slave
she
would
die
for
gogo
and
her
mother
adores
gogo
too
she
is
almost
jealous
of
dear
madame
pasquier
for
having
so
sweet
a
son
in
just
one
minute
from
now
when
she
has
cut
that
last
poor
mamma
will
call
gogo
to
her
and
give
him
a
good
hug
and
make
him
happy
for
a
week
wait
a
minute
and
see
what
did
i
tell
you
well
all
that
came
to
an
end
madame
pasquier
went
away
and
never
came
back
and
so
did
gogo
monsieur
and
madame
pasquier
were
dead
and
dear
mamma
died
in
a
week
from
the
cholera
poor
heartbroken
mimsey
was
taken
away
to
petersburg
warsaw
leipsic
venice
all
over
europe
by
her
father
as
as
herself
it
was
her
wish
and
her
father
that
she
should
become
a
pianist
by
profession
and
she
studied
hard
for
many
years
in
almost
every
capital
and
under
almost
every
master
in
europe
and
she
gave
promise
of
success
and
so
wandering
from
one
place
to
another
she
became
a
young
woman
a
greatly
petted
and
spoiled
and
young
woman
ibbetson
although
she
says
it
who
should
and
had
many
suitors
of
all
kinds
and
countries
but
the
heroic
and
angelic
gogo
with
his
lovely
straight
nose
and
his
hair
enfants
and
his
dear
little
white
silk
hat
and
eton
jacket
was
always
enshrined
in
her
memory
in
her
inmost
heart
as
the
incarnation
of
all
that
was
beautiful
and
brave
and
good
but
alas
what
had
become
of
this
gogo
in
the
mean
time
ah
he
was
never
even
heard
of
he
was
dead
well
this
young
mimsey
of
nineteen
was
attracted
by
a
very
witty
and
accomplished
english
attaché
at
vienna
a
harcourt
who
seemed
deeply
in
love
with
her
and
wished
her
to
be
his
wife
he
was
not
rich
but
seraskier
liked
and
trusted
him
so
much
that
he
dispossessed
himself
of
almost
everything
he
had
to
enable
this
young
couple
to
marry
and
they
did
and
truth
compels
me
to
admit
that
for
a
year
they
were
very
happy
and
contented
with
fate
and
each
other
then
a
great
misfortune
befell
them
both
in
a
most
unexpected
manner
through
four
or
five
consecutive
deaths
in
harcourt
family
he
became
first
lord
harcourt
and
then
the
duke
of
towers
and
since
then
ibbetson
i
have
not
had
an
hour
peace
or
happiness
in
the
first
place
a
son
was
born
to
me
a
cripple
poor
dear
and
deformed
from
his
birth
and
as
he
grew
older
it
soon
became
evident
that
he
was
also
born
without
a
mind
then
my
unfortunate
husband
changed
completely
he
drank
and
gambled
and
worse
till
we
came
to
live
together
as
strangers
and
only
spoke
to
each
other
in
public
and
before
the
world
ah
i
said
you
were
still
a
great
lady
an
english
duchess
i
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
that
happy
twelvemonth
with
that
bestial
duke
i
sober
chaste
and
clean
of
all
but
blood
alas
and
a
condemned
convict
oh
ibbetson
you
must
make
no
mistake
about
i
was
never
intended
by
nature
for
a
duchess
especially
an
english
one
not
but
what
if
dukes
and
duchesses
are
necessary
the
english
are
the
best
and
of
course
by
dukes
and
duchesses
i
mean
all
that
in
england
which
calls
itself
as
if
there
were
no
other
worth
speaking
of
some
of
them
are
almost
angelic
but
they
are
not
for
outsiders
like
me
perpetual
hunting
and
shooting
and
fishing
and
horseracing
eating
drinking
and
killing
and
making
love
eternal
court
gossip
and
the
prince
the
queen
whom
and
what
the
queen
likes
whom
and
what
she
does
tame
english
party
politics
the
church
a
church
that
does
know
its
own
mind
in
spite
of
its
deans
bishops
archbishops
and
their
wives
and
daughters
and
all
their
silly
solemn
sense
of
social
rank
and
dignity
endless
dinners
and
drums
and
no
society
from
year
end
to
year
end
but
each
other
ah
one
must
be
caught
young
and
put
in
harness
early
to
lead
such
an
existence
as
that
and
be
content
and
i
had
met
and
known
men
and
women
with
my
father
they
something
to
know
there
is
another
society
in
london
and
elsewhere
a
freemasonry
of
intellect
and
culture
and
hard
work

and
women
whose
names
are

ought
to
be
household
words
all
over
the
world
many
of
them
are
good
friends
of
mine
both
here
and
abroad
and
that
society
which
was
good
enough
for
my

is
quite
good
enough

look

never

our

why
ibbetson
you
are
nearer
to
the
than
i
am
do
you
remember
your
father
voice
shall
i
ever
forget
it
he
sang
to
me
only
last
night
and
in
the
midst
of
my
harrowing
anxiety
about
you
i
was
beguiled
into
listening
outside
the
window
he
sang
animam
he
the
nightingale
that
was
his
vocation
if
he
could
but
have
known
it
and
you
are
my
brother
bohemian
that
is
ah
vocation
it
was
to
be
the
wife
of
some
busy
man
of
science
conspirator
writer
artist
architect
if
you
like
to
fence
him
round
and
shield
him
from
all
the
little
worries
and
troubles
and
petty
vexations
of
life
i
am
a
woman
of
business
a
manager
and
all
that
he
would
have
had
a
warm
little
nest
to
come
home
to
after
hunting
his
idea
well
i
thought
myself
the
most
unhappy
woman
alive
and
wrapped
myself
up
in
my
affection
for
my
little
son
and
as
i
held
him
to
my
breast
and
vainly
tried
to
warm
and
mesmerize
him
into
feeling
and
intelligence
gogo
came
back
into
my
heart
and
i
was
forever
thinking
if
i
had
a
son
like
gogo
what
a
happy
woman
i
should
be
and
pitied
madame
pasquier
for
dying
and
leaving
him
so
soon
for
i
had
just
begun
to
dream
true
and
had
seen
gogo
and
his
sweet
mother
once
again
and
then
one
night
one
night
i
went
to
lady
gray
concert
and
saw
you
standing
in
a
corner
by
yourself
and
i
thought
with
a
leap
of
my
heart
that
must
be
gogo
grown
dark
and
with
a
beard
and
mustache
like
a
frenchman
but
alas
i
found
that
you
were
only
a
ibbetson
lady
cray
architect
whom
she
had
asked
to
her
house
because
he
was
the
handsomest
young
man
she
had
ever
seen
you
need
laugh
you
looked
very
nice
i
assure
you
well
ibbetson
although
you
were
not
gogo
you
became
suddenly
so
interesting
to
me
that
i
never
forgot
you
you
were
never
quite
out
of
my
mind
i
wanted
to
counsel
and
advise
you
and
take
you
by
the
hand
and
be
an
elder
sister
to
you
for
i
felt
myself
already
older
than
you
in
the
world
and
its
ways
i
wanted
to
be
twenty
years
older
still
and
to
have
you
for
my
son
i
do
know
i
wanted
you
seemed
so
lonely
and
fresh
and
unspotted
from
the
world
among
all
those
smart
worldlings
and
yet
so
big
and
strong
and
square
and
invincible
oh
so
strong
and
then
you
looked
at
me
with
such
sincere
and
sweet
and
chivalrous
admiration
and
sympathy
there
i
can
not
speak
of
it
and
then
you
were
like
what
gogo
might
have
become
oh
you
made
as
warm
and
devoted
a
friend
of
me
at
first
sight
as
any
one
might
desire
and
at
the
same
time
you
made
me
feel
so
and
shy
that
i
dared
not
ask
to
be
introduced
to
you
i
who
scarcely
know
what
shyness
is
dear
giulia
grisi
sang
al
pie
d
un
salice
and
that
tune
has
always
been
associated
in
my
mind
with
your
tongue
ever
since
and
always
will
be
your
dear
mother
used
to
play
it
on
the
harp
do
you
remember
then
came
that
extraordinary
dream
which
you
remember
as
well
as
i
do
it
a
wonder
you
see
my
dear
father
had
learned
a
strange
secret
of
the
brain
how
in
sleep
to
recall
past
things
and
people
and
places
as
they
had
once
been
seen
or
known
by
him
even
unremembered
things
he
called
it
true
and
by
long
practice
he
told
me
he
had
brought
the
art
of
doing
this
to
perfection
it
was
the
one
consolation
of
his
troubled
life
to
go
over
and
over
again
in
sleep
all
his
happy
youth
and
childhood
and
the
few
short
years
he
had
spent
with
his
beloved
young
wife
and
before
he
died
when
he
saw
i
had
become
so
unhappy
that
life
seemed
to
have
no
longer
any
possible
hope
of
pleasure
for
me
he
taught
me
his
very
simple
secret
thus
have
i
revisited
in
sleep
every
place
i
have
ever
lived
in
and
especially
this
the
beloved
spot
where
i
first
as
a
little
girl
knew
that
night
when
we
met
again
in
our
common
dream
i
was
looking
at
the
boys
from
saindou
school
going
to
their
and
thinking
very
much
of
you
as
i
had
seen
you
when
awake
a
few
hours
before
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
noire
when
you
suddenly
appeared
in
great
seeming
trouble
and
walking
like
a
tipsy
man
and
my
vision
was
disturbed
by
the
shadow
of
a
prison
alas
alas
and
two
little
jailers
jingling
their
keys
and
trying
to
hem
you
in
my
emotion
at
seeing
you
again
so
soon
was
so
great
that
i
nearly
woke
but
i
rescued
you
from
your
imaginary
terrors
and
held
you
by
the
hand
you
remember
all
the
rest
i
could
not
understand
why
you
should
be
in
my
dream
as
i
had
almost
always
dreamed
true
that
is
about
things
that
been
in
my
life
not
about
things
that
be
nor
could
i
account
for
the
solidity
of
your
hand
nor
understand
why
you
did
fade
away
when
i
took
it
and
blur
the
dream
it
was
a
most
perplexing
mystery
that
troubled
many
hours
of
both
my
waking
and
sleeping
life
then
came
that
meeting
with
you
at
cray
and
part
of
the
mystery
was
accounted
for
for
you
were
my
old
friend
gogo
after
all
but
it
is
still
a
mystery
an
awful
mystery
that
two
people
should
meet
as
we
are
meeting
now
in
one
and
the
same
dream
should
dovetail
so
accurately
into
each
brains
what
a
link
between
us
two
ibbetson
already
linked
by
such
memories
after
meeting
you
at
cray
i
felt
that
i
must
never
meet
you
again
either
waking
or
dreaming
the
discovery
that
you
were
gogo
after
all
combined
with
the
preoccupation
which
as
a
mere
stranger
you
had
already
caused
me
for
so
long
created
such
a
disturbance
in
my
spirit
that
that
there
you
must
try
and
imagine
it
for
yourself
even
before
that
revelation
at
cray
i
had
often
known
you
were
here
in
my
dream
and
i
had
carefully
avoided
you
though
little
dreaming
you
were
here
in
your
own
dream
too
often
from
that
little
up
there
i
have
seen
you
wandering
about
the
park
and
avenue
in
seeming
search
of
and
wondered
why
and
how
you
came
you
drove
me
into
attics
and
servants
bedrooms
to
conceal
myself
from
you
it
was
quite
a
game
of
as
we
used
to
call
it
but
after
our
meeting
at
cray
i
felt
there
must
be
no
more
i
avoided
coming
here
at
all
you
drove
me
away
altogether
now
try
to
imagine
what
i
felt
when
the
news
of
your
terrible
quarrel
with
ibbetson
burst
upon
the
world
i
was
beside
myself
i
came
here
night
after
night
i
looked
for
you
everywhere
in
the
park
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
at
the
mare
at
st
cloud
in
every
place
i
could
think
of
and
now
here
you
are
at
last
at
last
hush
do
speak
yet
i
have
soon
done
six
months
ago
i
lost
my
poor
little
son
and
much
as
i
loved
him
i
can
not
wish
him
back
again
in
a
fortnight
i
shall
be
legally
separated
from
my
wretched
husband
i
shall
be
quite
alone
in
the
world
and
then
ibbetson
oh
dearest
friend
that
child
or
woman
ever
had
every
hour
that
i
can
steal
from
my
waking
existence
shall
henceforward
be
devoted
to
you
as
long
as
both
of
us
live
and
sleep
the
same
hours
out
of
the
my
one
object
and
endeavor
shall
be
to
make
up
for
the
wreck
of
your
sweet
and
valuable
young
life
walls
shall
not
a
prison
make
nor
iron
bars
a
cage
and
here
she
laughed
and
cried
together
so
that
her
eyes
closing
up
squeezed
out
her
tears
and
i
thought
oh
that
i
might
drink
them
and
now
i
will
leave
you
i
am
a
weak
and
loving
woman
and
must
not
stay
by
your
side
till
i
can
do
so
without
too
much
and
indeed
i
feel
i
shall
soon
fall
awake
from
sheer
exhaustion
of
joy
oh
selfish
and
jealous
wretch
that
i
am
to
talk
of
joy
i
can
not
help
rejoicing
that
no
other
woman
can
be
to
you
what
i
hope
to
be
no
other
woman
can
ever
come
you
i
am
your
tyrant
and
your
slave
your
calamity
has
made
you
mine
forever
but
all
my
life
all
all
shall
be
spent
in
trying
to
make
you
forget
yours
and
i
think
i
shall
succeed
oh
do
make
such
dreadful
haste
i
exclaimed
am
dreaming
true
what
is
to
prove
all
this
to
me
when
i
wake
either
i
am
the
most
abject
and
wretched
of
men
or
life
will
never
have
another
unhappy
moment
how
am
i
to
listen
do
you
remember
sed
apta
le
petit
pavilion
as
you
used
to
call
it
that
is
still
my
home
when
i
am
here
it
shall
be
yours
if
you
like
when
the
time
comes
you
will
find
much
to
interest
you
there
well
early
in
your
cell
you
will
receive
from
me
an
envelope
with
a
slip
of
paper
in
it
containing
some
violets
and
the
words
sed
apta
à
bientôt
written
in
violet
ink
will
that
convince
you
oh
yes
yes
well
then
give
me
your
hands
dearest
and
best
both
hands
i
shall
soon
be
here
again
by
this
i
shall
count
the
hours
and
she
was
gone
and
i
woke
i
woke
to
the
gaslit
darkness
of
my
cell
it
was
just
before
dawn
one
of
the
warders
asked
me
civilly
if
i
wanted
anything
and
gave
me
a
drink
of
water
i
thanked
him
quietly
and
recalled
what
had
just
happened
to
me
with
a
wonder
an
ecstasy
for
which
i
can
find
no
words
no
it
had
been
a
of
that
i
felt
quite
sure
not
in
any
one
single
respect
there
had
been
nothing
of
the
dream
about
it
except
its
transcendent
ineffable
enchantment
every
inflexion
of
that
beloved
voice
with
its
scarcely
perceptible
foreign
accent
that
i
had
never
noticed
before
every
animated
gesture
with
its
subtle
reminiscence
of
both
her
father
and
her
mother
her
black
dress
trimmed
with
gray
her
black
and
gray
hat
the
scent
of
about
her
all
were
more
distinctly
and
vividly
impressed
upon
me
than
if
she
had
just
been
actually
and
in
the
flesh
at
my
bedside
her
tones
still
rang
in
my
ears
my
eyes
were
full
of
her
now
her
profile
so
pure
and
chiselled
now
her
full
face
with
her
gray
eyes
sometimes
tender
and
grave
and
wet
with
tears
sometimes
half
closed
in
laughter
fixed
on
mine
her
lithe
sweet
body
curved
forward
as
she
sat
and
clasped
her
knees
her
arched
and
slender
smooth
straight
feet
so
delicately
shod
that
seemed
now
and
then
to
beat
time
to
her
story
and
then
that
strange
sense
of
the
transfusion
of
life
at
the
touching
of
the
hands
oh
it
was
though
what
it
was
i
can
not
tell
i
turned
on
my
side
happy
beyond
expression
and
fell
asleep
again
a
dreamless
sleep
that
lasted
till
i
was
woke
and
told
to
dress
illustration
my
eyes
were
full
of
her
some
breakfast
was
brought
to
me
and
it
an
envelope
open
which
contained
some
violets
and
a
slip
of
paper
scented
with
on
which
were
written
in
violet
ink
the
words
parva
sed
apla
à
bientôt
tarapatapoum
i
will
pass
over
the
time
that
elapsed
between
my
sentence
and
its
commutation
the
ministrations
and
exhortations
of
the
good
chaplain
the
kind
and
touching
farewells
of
and
lintot
who
had
also
believed
that
i
was
ibbetson
son
i
undeceived
them
the
visit
of
my
old
friend
deane
and
her
strange
passion
of
gratitude
and
admiration
i
have
no
doubt
it
would
all
be
interesting
enough
if
properly
remembered
and
ably
told
but
it
was
all
too
much
like
a
dream
anybody
dream
not
one
of
all
too
slight
and
flimsy
to
have
left
an
abiding
remembrance
or
to
matter
much
in
due
time
i
was
removed
to
the
jail
at
and
bade
farewell
to
the
world
and
adapted
myself
to
the
conditions
of
my
new
outer
life
with
a
good
grace
and
with
a
very
light
heart
the
prison
routine
leaving
the
brain
so
free
and
unoccupied
the
healthy
labor
the
pure
air
the
plain
wholesome
food
were
delightful
to
me
a
daily
mental
rest
after
the
tumultuous
emotions
of
each
night
for
i
was
soon
back
again
in
passy
where
i
spent
every
hour
of
my
sleep
you
may
be
sure
never
very
far
from
the
old
which
went
through
all
its
changes
from
bare
bough
to
tender
shoots
and
blossoms
from
blossom
to
ripe
fruit
from
fruit
to
yellow
falling
leaf
and
then
to
bare
boughs
again
and
all
in
a
few
peaceful
nights
which
were
my
days
i
flatter
myself
by
this
time
that
i
know
the
habits
of
a
french
and
its
caterpillars
and
all
the
dear
people
i
loved
and
of
whom
i
could
never
tire
were
about
all
but
one
one
at
last
she
arrived
the
garden
door
was
pushed
the
bell
rang
and
she
came
across
the
lawn
radiant
and
tall
and
swift
and
opened
wide
her
arms
and
there
with
our
little
world
around
us
all
that
we
had
ever
loved
and
cared
for
but
quite
unseen
and
unheard
by
them
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
since
my
mother
and
madame
seraskier
had
died
i
held
a
woman
in
my
arms
and
she
pressed
her
lips
to
mine
illustration
at
last
she
arrived
round
and
round
the
lawn
we
walked
and
talked
as
we
had
often
done
fifteen
sixteen
twenty
years
ago
there
were
many
things
to
say
the
charming
prince
and
the
fairy
tarapatapoum
were
prettily
well
together
at
last
the
time
sped
quickly
far
too
quickly
i
said
you
told
me
i
should
see
your
house
sed
apta
that
i
should
find
much
to
interest
me
there
she
blushed
a
little
and
smiled
and
said
you
must
expect
much
and
we
soon
found
ourselves
walking
thither
up
the
avenue
thus
we
had
often
walked
as
children
and
once
a
memorable
once
besides
there
stood
the
little
white
house
with
its
golden
legend
as
i
had
seen
it
a
thousand
times
when
a
boy
a
hundred
since
how
sweet
and
small
it
looked
in
the
mellow
sunshine
we
mounted
the
stone
and
opened
the
door
and
entered
my
heart
beat
violently
everything
was
as
it
had
always
been
as
far
as
i
could
see
seraskier
sat
in
a
chair
by
the
window
reading
schiller
and
took
no
notice
of
us
his
hair
moved
in
the
gentle
breeze
overhead
we
heard
the
rooms
being
swept
and
the
beds
made
i
followed
her
into
a
little
where
i
did
not
remember
to
have
been
before
it
was
full
of
odds
and
ends
why
have
you
brought
me
here
i
asked
she
laughed
and
said
open
the
door
in
the
wall
opposite
there
was
no
door
and
i
said
so
then
she
took
my
hand
and
lo
there
a
door
and
she
pushed
and
we
entered
another
suite
of
apartments
that
never
could
have
been
there
before
there
had
never
been
room
for
them
nor
ever
could
have
been
in
all
passy
illustration
neuha
led
her
torquil
by
the
hand
come
she
said
laughing
and
blushing
at
once
for
she
seemed
nervous
and
excited
and
shy
do
you
remember
neuha
led
her
torquil
by
the
hand
and
waved
along
the
vault
her
flaming
brand
do
you
remember
your
little
drawing
out
of
in
the
green
morocco
byron
here
it
is
in
the
top
drawer
of
this
beautiful
cabinet
here
are
all
the
drawings
you
ever
did
for
me
plain
and
colored
with
dates
explanations
all
written
by
myself
de
la
fee
they
are
only
duplicates
i
have
the
real
ones
at
my
house
in
hampshire
the
cabinet
also
is
a
duplicate
is
it
a
beauty
it
from
the
czar
winter
palace
everything
here
is
a
duplicate
more
or
less
see
this
is
a
little
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
perfect
it
is
the
famous
à
of
princesse
de
chevagné
i
never
use
it
except
now
and
then
to
eat
a
slice
of
english
household
bread
with
french
butter
and
little
mimsey
out
there
does
so
sometimes
when
gogo
brings
her
one
and
it
makes
big
mimsey
mouth
water
to
see
her
so
she
has
to
go
and
do
likewise
would
you
like
a
slice
you
see
the
cloth
is
spread
there
is
a
bottle
of
famous
champagne
from
de
rothschild
there
plenty
more
where
that
came
from
the
flowers
are
from
chatsworth
and
this
is
a
lobster
salad
for
papa
was
great
at
lobster
salads
and
taught
me
i
mixed
it
myself
a
fortnight
ago
and
as
you
see
it
is
as
fresh
and
sweet
as
if
i
had
only
just
made
it
and
the
flowers
have
faded
a
bit
here
are
cigarettes
and
pipes
and
cigars
i
hope
they
are
good
i
smoke
myself
is
all
the
furniture
rare
and
beautiful
i
have
robbed
every
palace
in
europe
of
its
very
best
and
yet
the
owners
are
not
a
penny
the
worse
you
should
see
look
at
those
pictures
the
very
pick
of
raphael
and
titian
and
velasquez
look
at
that
piano
i
have
heard
liszt
play
upon
it
over
and
over
again
in
leipsic
here
is
my
library
every
book
i
ever
read
is
there
and
every
binding
i
ever
admired
i
do
often
read
them
but
i
dust
them
carefully
arranged
that
dust
shall
fall
on
them
in
the
usual
way
to
make
it
real
and
remind
one
of
the
outer
life
one
is
so
glad
to
leave
all
has
to
be
taken
very
seriously
here
and
one
must
put
one
self
to
a
little
trouble
see
here
is
my
father
microscope
and
under
it
a
small
spider
caught
on
the
premises
by
myself
it
is
still
alive
it
seems
cruel
does
it
but
it
only
exists
in
our
brains
look
at
the
dress
i
got
on
feel
it
how
every
detail
is
worked
out
and
you
have
unconsciously
done
the
same
that
the
suit
you
wore
that
morning
at
cray
under
the
the
nicest
suit
i
ever
saw
here
is
a
spot
of
ink
on
your
sleeve
as
real
as
can
be
bravo
and
this
button
is
coming
off
quite
right
i
will
sew
it
on
with
a
dream
needle
and
dream
thread
and
a
dream
thimble
this
little
door
leads
to
every
in
europe
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
build
and
arrange
them
all
by
myself
quite
a
week
of
nights
it
is
very
pleasant
to
walk
there
with
a
good
catalogue
and
make
it
rain
cats
and
dogs
outside
through
this
curtain
is
an
opera
box
the
most
comfortable
one
ever
been
in
it
does
for
theatres
as
well
and
oratorios
and
concerts
and
scientific
lectures
you
shall
see
from
it
every
performance
ever
been
at
in
half
a
dozen
languages
you
shall
hold
my
hand
and
understand
them
all
every
singer
that
i
ever
heard
you
shall
hear
dear
giulia
grisi
shall
sing
the
song
again
and
again
and
you
shall
hear
the
applause
ah
what
applause
come
into
this
little
room
my
favorite
out
of
window
and
down
these
steps
we
can
walk
or
drive
to
any
place
you
or
i
have
ever
been
to
and
other
places
besides
nothing
is
far
and
we
have
only
to
go
hand
in
hand
i
do
know
yet
where
my
stables
and
are
you
must
help
me
to
find
out
but
so
far
i
have
never
lacked
a
carriage
at
the
bottom
of
those
steps
when
i
wanted
to
drive
nor
a
nor
a
gondola
nor
a
lovely
place
to
go
to
out
of
window
from
this
divan
we
can
sit
and
gaze
on
whatever
we
like
what
shall
it
be
just
now
you
perceive
there
is
a
wild
and
turbulent
sea
with
not
a
ship
in
sight
do
you
hear
the
waves
tumbling
and
splashing
and
see
the
albatross
i
had
been
reading
keats
to
the
nightingale
and
was
so
fascinated
by
the
idea
of
a
lattice
opening
on
the
foam
perilous
seas
by
faery
lands
that
i
thought
it
would
be
nice
to
have
a
lattice
like
that
myself
i
tried
to
evolve
that
sea
from
my
inner
consciousness
you
know
or
rather
from
seas
that
i
have
sailed
over
do
you
like
it
it
was
done
a
fortnight
ago
and
the
waves
have
been
tumbling
about
ever
since
how
they
roar
and
hark
at
the
wind
i
could
manage
the
lands
it
wants
one
lattice
for
the
sea
and
one
for
the
land
i
afraid
you
must
help
me
mean
while
what
would
you
like
there
tonight
the
yosemite
valley
the
nevski
prospect
in
the
winter
with
the
sledges
the
rialto
the
bay
of
naples
after
sunset
with
vesuvius
in
eruption
oh
mary
mimsey
what
do
i
care
for
vesuvius
and
sunsets
and
the
bay
of
naples
vesuvius
is
in
my
heart
thus
began
for
us
both
a
period
of
years
during
which
we
passed
eight
or
nine
hours
out
of
the
in
each
company
except
on
a
few
rare
occasions
when
illness
or
some
other
cause
prevented
one
of
us
from
sleeping
at
the
proper
time
mary
mary
i
idolized
her
while
she
lived
i
idolize
her
memory
for
her
sake
all
women
are
sacred
to
me
even
the
lowest
and
most
depraved
and
they
always
found
a
helping
friend
in
how
can
i
pay
a
fitting
tribute
to
one
so
near
to
me
nearer
than
any
woman
can
ever
have
been
to
any
man
i
know
her
mind
as
i
know
my
own
no
two
human
souls
can
ever
have
interpenetrated
each
other
as
ours
have
done
or
we
should
have
heard
of
it
every
thought
she
ever
had
from
her
childhood
to
her
death
has
been
revealed
every
thought
of
mine
living
as
we
did
it
was
inevitable
the
touch
of
a
finger
was
enough
to
establish
the
strange
circuit
and
wake
a
common
consciousness
of
past
and
present
either
hers
or
mine
and
oh
how
thankful
am
i
that
some
lucky
chance
has
preserved
me
murderer
and
convict
as
i
am
from
anything
she
would
have
found
it
impossible
to
condone
i
try
not
to
think
that
shyness
and
poverty
ungainliness
and
social
imbecility
combined
have
had
as
much
to
do
as
and
in
keeping
me
out
of
so
many
pitfalls
that
have
been
fatal
to
so
many
men
better
and
more
gifted
than
myself
i
try
to
think
that
her
extraordinary
affection
the
chance
result
of
a
persistent
impression
received
in
childhood
has
followed
me
through
life
without
my
knowing
it
and
in
some
occult
mysterious
way
has
kept
me
from
thoughts
and
deeds
that
would
have
rendered
me
unworthy
even
in
her
too
indulgent
eyes
who
knows
but
that
her
sweet
mother
farewell
kiss
and
blessing
and
the
tender
tears
she
shed
over
me
when
i
bade
her
at
the
avenue
gate
so
many
years
ago
may
have
had
an
antiseptic
charm
mary
i
have
followed
her
from
her
sickly
suffering
childhood
to
her
girlhood
from
her
gracefully
lanky
girlhood
to
the
day
of
her
retirement
from
the
world
of
which
she
was
so
great
an
ornament
from
girl
to
woman
it
seems
like
a
triumphal
procession
through
all
the
courts
of
europe
scenes
the
like
of
which
i
have
never
even
dreamed
flattery
and
strife
to
have
turned
the
head
of
any
princess
and
she
was
the
simple
daughter
of
a
working
scientist
and
physician
the
granddaughter
of
a
fiddler
yet
even
austrian
court
etiquette
was
waived
in
favor
of
the
child
of
plain
seraskier
what
men
have
i
seen
at
her
feet
how
splendid
handsome
gallant
brilliant
chivalrous
lordly
and
gay
and
to
all
from
her
the
same
happy
geniality
the
same
kindly
laughing
frolicsome
innocent
gayety
with
never
a
thought
of
self
le
major
was
right
elle
avait
toutes
les
intelligences
de
la
tête
et
du
coeur
and
old
and
young
the
best
and
the
worst
seemed
to
love
and
respect
her
alike
and
women
as
well
as
men
for
her
perfect
sincerity
her
sweet
reasonableness
and
all
this
time
i
was
plodding
at
my
dull
in
pentonville
carrying
out
another
designs
for
a
stable
or
a
cottage
and
not
even
achieving
that
poor
task
particularly
well
it
would
have
driven
me
mad
with
humiliation
and
jealousy
to
see
this
past
life
of
hers
but
we
saw
it
all
hand
in
hand
together
the
magical
circuit
was
established
and
i
knew
as
i
saw
how
it
all
affected
her
and
marvelled
at
her
simplicity
in
thinking
all
this
pomp
and
splendor
of
so
little
consequence
and
i
trembled
to
find
that
what
space
in
her
heart
was
not
filled
by
the
remembrance
of
her
mother
and
the
image
of
her
father
one
of
the
noblest
and
best
of
men
enshrined
the
ridiculous
figure
of
a
small
boy
in
a
white
silk
hat
and
an
eton
jacket
and
that
small
boy
was
i
then
came
a
dreadful
twelvemonth
that
i
was
fain
to
leave
a
blank
the
twelvemonth
during
which
her
girlish
fancy
for
her
husband
lasted
and
then
her
life
was
mine
again
forever
and
life
the
life
of
a
convict
is
not
as
a
rule
a
happy
one
his
bed
is
not
generally
thought
a
bed
of
roses
mine
was
if
i
had
been
the
most
miserable
leper
that
ever
crawled
to
his
wattled
hut
in
molokai
i
should
also
have
been
the
happiest
of
men
could
sleep
but
have
found
me
there
and
could
i
but
sleeping
have
been
the
friend
of
sleeping
mary
seraskier
she
would
have
loved
me
all
the
more
she
has
filled
my
long
life
of
bondage
with
such
felicity
as
no
monarch
has
ever
dreamed
and
has
found
her
own
felicity
in
doing
so
that
poor
plodding
existence
i
led
before
my
great
misadventure
and
have
tried
to
describe
she
has
witnessed
almost
every
hour
of
it
with
passionate
interest
and
sympathy
as
we
went
hand
in
hand
together
through
each
other
past
she
would
at
any
time
have
been
only
too
glad
to
share
it
leaving
her
own
i
dreaded
the
effect
of
such
a
sordid
revelation
upon
one
who
had
lived
so
brilliantly
and
at
such
an
altitude
i
need
have
had
no
fear
just
as
she
thought
me
an
angelic
hero
at
eight
years
old
she
remained
persuaded
all
through
her
life
that
i
was
an
apollo
a
misunderstood
genius
a
martyr
i
am
sick
with
shame
when
i
think
of
it
but
i
am
not
the
first
unworthy
mortal
on
whom
blind
undiscriminating
love
has
chosen
to
lavish
its
most
priceless
treasures
tarapatapoum
is
not
the
only
fairy
who
has
idealized
a
hulking
clown
with
an
ass
head
into
a
prince
charming
the
spectacle
alas
is
not
infrequent
but
at
least
i
have
been
humbly
thankful
for
the
undeserved
blessing
and
known
its
value
and
moreover
i
think
i
may
lay
claim
to
one
talent
that
of
also
knowing
by
intuition
when
and
where
and
how
to
love
in
a
moment
in
a
flash
and
forever
years
it
seems
like
a
thousand
so
much
have
we
seen
and
felt
and
done
in
that
busy
enchanted
quarter
of
a
century
and
yet
how
quickly
the
time
has
sped
and
now
i
must
endeavor
to
give
some
account
of
our
wonderful
inner
life
a
delicate
and
difficult
task
there
is
both
an
impertinence
and
a
lack
of
taste
in
any
man
laying
bare
to
the
public
eye
to
any
eye
the
bliss
that
has
come
to
him
through
the
love
of
a
devoted
woman
with
whose
life
his
own
has
been
bound
up
the
most
sympathetic
reader
is
apt
to
be
repelled
by
such
a
revelation
to
be
sceptical
of
the
beauties
and
virtues
and
mental
gifts
of
one
he
has
never
seen
at
all
events
to
feel
that
they
are
no
concern
of
his
and
ought
to
be
the
subject
of
a
sacred
reticence
on
the
part
of
her
too
fortunate
lover
or
husband
the
lack
of
such
reticence
has
marred
the
interest
of
many
an
autobiography
of
many
a
novel
even
and
in
private
life
who
does
not
know
by
painful
experience
how
embarrassing
to
the
listener
such
tender
confidences
can
sometimes
be
i
will
try
my
best
not
to
transgress
in
this
particular
if
i
fail
i
may
have
failed
already
i
can
only
plead
that
the
circumstances
are
quite
exceptional
and
not
to
be
matched
and
that
allowances
must
be
made
for
the
deep
gratitude
i
owe
and
feel
over
and
above
even
my
passionate
admiration
and
love
for
the
next
three
years
of
my
life
has
nothing
to
show
but
the
alternation
of
such
honeymooning
as
never
was
before
with
a
dull
but
contented
prison
life
not
one
hour
of
which
is
worth
recording
or
even
remembering
except
as
a
foil
to
its
alternative
it
had
but
one
hour
for
me
the
bed
hour
and
fortunately
that
was
an
early
one
healthily
tired
in
body
blissfully
expectant
in
mind
i
would
lie
on
my
back
with
my
hands
duly
crossed
under
my
head
and
sleep
would
soon
steal
over
me
like
balm
and
before
i
had
forgotten
who
and
what
and
where
i
really
was
i
would
reach
the
goal
on
which
my
will
was
intent
and
waking
up
find
my
body
in
another
place
in
another
garb
on
a
couch
by
an
enchanted
window
still
with
my
arms
crossed
behind
my
head
in
the
sacramental
attitude
then
would
i
stretch
my
limbs
and
slip
myself
free
of
my
outer
life
as
a
butterfly
from
the
durance
of
its
cocoon
with
an
unutterable
sense
of
youth
and
strength
and
freshness
and
felicity
and
opening
my
eyes
i
would
see
on
the
adjacent
couch
the
form
of
mary
also
supine
but
motionless
and
inanimate
as
a
statue
nothing
could
wake
her
to
life
till
the
time
came
her
hours
were
somewhat
later
and
she
was
still
in
the
toils
of
the
outer
life
i
had
just
left
behind
me
and
these
toils
in
her
case
were
more
complicated
than
in
mine
although
she
had
given
up
the
world
she
had
many
friends
and
an
immense
correspondence
and
then
being
a
woman
endowed
with
boundless
health
and
energy
splendid
buoyancy
of
animal
spirits
and
a
great
capacity
for
business
she
had
made
for
herself
many
cares
and
occupations
she
was
the
virtual
mistress
of
a
home
for
fallen
women
a
reformatory
for
juvenile
thieves
and
a
children
convalescent
hospital
to
all
of
which
she
gave
her
immediate
personal
superintendence
and
almost
every
penny
she
had
she
had
let
her
house
in
hampshire
and
lived
with
a
couple
of
female
servants
in
a
small
furnished
house
on
campden
hill
she
did
without
a
carriage
and
went
about
in
cabs
and
omnibuses
dressed
like
a
daily
governess
though
nobody
could
appear
more
regally
magnificent
than
she
did
when
we
were
together
she
still
kept
her
name
and
title
as
a
potent
weapon
of
influence
on
behalf
of
her
charities
and
wielded
it
mercilessly
in
her
constant
raid
on
the
purse
of
the
benevolent
philistine
who
is
fond
of
great
people
all
of
which
gave
rise
to
much
comment
that
did
not
affect
her
equanimity
in
the
least
she
also
attended
lectures
committees
boards
and
councils
opened
bazaars
and
soup
kitchens
and
coffee
taverns
etc
the
list
of
her
tasks
was
endless
thus
her
outer
life
was
filled
to
overflowing
and
unlike
mine
every
hour
of
it
was
worth
record
as
i
well
know
who
have
witnessed
it
all
but
this
is
not
the
place
in
which
to
write
the
outer
life
of
the
duchess
of
towers
another
hand
has
done
that
as
everybody
knows
every
page
henceforward
must
be
sacred
to
mary
seraskier
the
fée
tarapatapoum
of
magna
sed
apta
for
so
we
had
called
the
new
home
and
palace
of
art
she
had
added
on
to
parva
sed
apta
the
home
of
her
childhood
to
return
thither
where
we
left
her
lying
unconscious
soon
the
color
would
come
back
to
her
cheeks
the
breath
to
her
nostrils
the
pulse
to
her
heart
and
she
would
wake
to
her
eden
as
she
called
it
our
common
inner
life
that
we
might
spend
it
in
each
other
company
for
the
next
eight
hours
pending
this
happy
moment
i
would
make
coffee
such
coffee
and
smoke
a
cigarette
or
two
and
to
fully
appreciate
the
bliss
of
one
must
be
an
habitual
smoker
who
lives
his
real
life
in
an
english
jail
when
she
awoke
from
her
sixteen
hours
busy
trance
in
the
outer
world
such
a
choice
of
pleasures
lay
before
us
as
no
other
mortal
has
ever
known
she
had
been
all
her
life
a
great
traveller
and
had
dwelt
in
many
lands
and
cities
and
seen
more
of
life
and
the
world
and
nature
than
most
people
i
had
but
to
take
her
hand
and
one
of
us
had
but
to
wish
and
lo
wherever
either
of
us
had
been
whatever
either
of
us
had
seen
or
heard
or
felt
or
even
eaten
or
drunk
there
it
was
all
over
again
to
choose
from
with
the
other
to
share
in
it
such
a
hypnotism
of
ourselves
and
each
other
as
was
never
dreamed
of
before
everything
was
as
as
real
to
us
both
as
it
had
been
to
either
at
the
actual
time
of
its
occurrence
with
an
added
freshness
and
charm
that
never
belonged
to
mortal
existence
it
was
no
dream
it
was
a
second
life
a
better
land
we
had
however
to
stay
within
certain
bounds
and
beware
of
transgressing
certain
laws
that
we
discovered
for
ourselves
but
could
not
quite
account
for
for
instance
it
was
fatal
to
attempt
exploits
that
were
outside
of
our
real
experience
to
fly
or
to
jump
from
a
height
or
do
any
of
these
things
that
make
the
charm
and
wonder
of
ordinary
dreams
if
we
did
so
our
true
dream
was
blurred
and
became
as
an
ordinary
dream
vague
futile
unreal
and
untrue
the
baseless
fabric
of
a
vision
nor
must
we
alter
ourselves
in
any
way
even
to
the
shape
of
a
we
must
remain
ourselves
although
we
kept
ourselves
at
our
very
best
and
could
choose
what
age
we
should
be
we
chose
from
to
and
stuck
to
it
yet
there
were
many
things
quite
as
impossible
in
real
life
that
we
could
do
with
impunity
most
delightful
things
for
instance
after
the
waking
cup
of
coffee
it
was
certainly
delightful
to
spend
a
couple
of
hours
in
the
yosemite
valley
leisurely
strolling
about
and
gazing
at
the
giant
pines
a
source
of
delight
to
both
of
us
breathing
the
fragrant
fresh
air
looking
at
our
and
listening
to
their
talk
with
the
agreeable
consciousness
that
solid
and
substantial
as
we
were
to
each
other
we
were
quite
inaudible
invisible
and
intangible
to
them
often
we
would
dispense
with
the
tourists
and
have
the
yosemite
valley
all
to
ourselves
always
there
and
in
whatever
place
she
had
visited
with
her
husband
we
would
dispense
with
the
figure
of
her
former
self
and
him
a
sight
i
could
not
have
borne
when
we
had
strolled
and
gazed
our
fill
it
was
delightful
again
just
by
a
slight
effort
of
her
will
and
a
few
moments
closing
of
our
eyes
to
find
ourselves
driving
along
the
via
cornice
to
an
exquisite
garden
concert
in
dresden
or
being
rowed
in
a
gondola
to
a
saturday
pop
at
james
hall
and
thence
jumping
into
a
hansom
we
would
be
whisked
through
piccadilly
and
the
park
to
the
arc
de
triomphe
home
to
magna
sed
apta
rue
de
la
pompe
passy
a
charming
drive
and
not
a
bit
too
long
just
in
time
for
dinner
a
very
delicious
little
dinner
judiciously
ordered
out
of
remembrance
not
and
served
in
the
most
exquisite
little
in
all
paris
the
princesse
de
chevagné
huîtres
let
us
say
and
soupe
à
la
bonne
femme
with
a
perdrix
aux
choux
to
follow
and
pancakes
and
fromage
de
brie
and
to
drink
a
bottle
of
romané
conti
without
even
the
bother
of
waiters
to
change
the
dishes
a
wish
a
moment
shutting
of
the
eyes
and
it
was
done
and
then
we
could
wait
on
each
other
after
my
prison
fare
and
with
nothing
but
tenpenny
london
dinners
to
recollect
in
the
immediate
past
i
trust
i
shall
not
be
thought
a
gross
materialist
for
appreciating
these
small
banquets
and
in
such
company
the
only
dinner
i
could
recall
which
was
not
a
tenpenny
one
except
the
old
dinners
of
my
childhood
was
that
famous
dinner
at
cray
where
i
had
discovered
that
the
duchess
of
towers
was
mimsey
seraskier
and
i
did
not
eat
much
of
then
a
cigarette
and
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
glass
of
curaçoa
and
after
to
reach
our
private
box
we
had
but
to
cross
the
room
and
lift
a
curtain
and
there
before
us
was
the
theatre
or
brilliantly
lighted
and
the
instruments
tuning
up
and
the
splendid
company
pouring
in
crowned
heads
famous
beauties
warriors
and
statesmen
garibaldi
gortschakoff
cavour
bismarck
and
moltke
now
so
famous
and
who
not
mary
would
point
them
out
to
me
and
in
the
next
box
seraskier
and
his
tall
daughter
who
seemed
friends
with
all
that
brilliant
crowd
now
it
was
petersburg
now
berlin
now
vienna
paris
naples
milan
london
every
great
city
in
turn
but
our
box
was
always
the
same
and
always
the
best
in
the
house
and
i
the
one
person
privileged
to
smoke
my
cigar
in
the
face
of
all
that
royalty
fashion
and
splendor
then
after
the
overture
up
went
the
curtain
if
it
was
a
play
and
the
play
was
in
german
or
russian
or
italian
i
had
but
to
touch
little
finger
to
understand
it
all
a
true
but
incomprehensible
thing
for
well
as
i
might
understand
i
could
not
have
spoken
a
word
of
either
and
the
moment
that
slight
contact
was
discontinued
they
might
as
well
have
been
acting
in
greek
or
hebrew
for
but
it
was
for
music
we
cared
the
most
and
i
think
i
may
say
that
of
music
during
those
three
years
and
ever
after
we
have
had
our
glut
for
all
through
her
busy
waking
life
mary
found
time
to
hear
whatever
good
music
was
going
on
in
london
that
she
might
bring
it
back
to
me
at
night
and
we
would
rehear
it
together
again
and
again
and
it
is
a
rare
privilege
for
two
private
individuals
and
one
of
them
a
convict
to
assist
at
a
performance
honored
by
the
patronage
and
presence
of
crowned
heads
and
yet
be
able
to
encore
any
particular
thing
that
pleases
them
how
often
have
we
done
that
illustration
oh
joachim
oh
clara
schumann
oh
piattil
all
of
whom
i
know
so
well
but
have
never
heard
with
the
fleshly
ear
oh
others
whom
it
would
be
invidious
to
mention
without
mentioning
all
a
glorious
list
how
we
have
made
you
all
unconscious
repeat
the
same
movements
over
and
over
again
without
ever
from
you
a
sign
of
impatience
or
fatigue
how
often
have
we
summoned
liszt
to
play
to
us
on
his
own
favorite
piano
which
adorned
our
own
favorite
how
little
he
knew
or
will
ever
know
now
alas
what
exquisite
delight
he
gave
us
oh
pattit
angelina
oh
santley
and
sims

oh

the
i
wonder
you

then
the
the
museums
the
botanical
and
zoological
gardens
of
all
countries
magna

had
space
for
them
all
even
to
the
elgin
marbles
room
of
the
british
museum
which
i
added
myself
what
enchanted
hours
have
we
spent
among
the
pictures
and
statues
of
the
world
weeding
them
here
and
there
perhaps
or
hanging
them
differently
or
placing
them
in
what
we
thought
a
better
light
the
venus
of
milo
showed
to
far
greater
advantage
in
magna
sed
apta
than
at
the
louvre
and
when
busied
thus
delightfully
at
home
and
to
enhance
the
delight
we
made
it
shocking
bad
weather
outside
it
rained
cats
and
dogs
or
else
the
north
wind
piped
and
snow
fell
on
the
desolate
gardens
of
magna
sed
apta
and
whitened
the
landscape
as
far
as
eye
could
see
nearest
to
our
hearts
however
were
many
pictures
of
our
own
time
for
we
were
moderns
of
the
moderns
after
all
in
spite
of
our
efforts
of
there
was
scarcely
a
living
or
recently
living
master
in
europe
whose
best
works
were
not
in
our
possession
so
lighted
and
hung
that
even
the
masters
themselves
would
have
been
content
for
we
had
plenty
of
space
at
our
command
and
each
picture
had
a
wall
to
itself
so
toned
as
to
do
full
justice
to
its
beauty
and
a
comfortable
sofa
for
two
just
opposite
but
in
the
little
room
we
most
lived
in
the
room
with
the
magic
window
we
had
crowded
a
few
special
favorites
of
the
english
school
for
we
had
so
much

like

who
seems
to
have
loved

as
much
as
i
loved
mine
then
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
all
this
unparalleled
artistic
splendor
we
felt
that
a
something
was
wanting
there
was
a
certain
hollowness
about
it
and
we
discovered
that
in
our
case
the
principal
motives
for
collecting
all
these
beautiful
things
were
absent
we
were
not
the
sole
possessors
we
had
nobody
to
show
them
to
therefore
we
could
take
no
pride
in
them
illustration
the
nursery
and
found
that
when
we
wanted
bad
weather
for
a
change
and
the
joys
of
home
we
could
be
quite
as
happy
in
my
old
where
the
squirrels
and
the
monkey
and
the
hedgehog
were
with
each
of
us
on
a
by
the
each
roasting
chestnuts
for
the
other
and
one
book
between
us
for
one
of
us
to
read
out
loud
or
better
still
the
morning
and
evening
papers
she
had
read
a
few
hours
earlier
and
marvellous
to
relate
she
had
not
even
them
when
awake
she
had
merely
glanced
through
them
carefully
taking
in
the
aspect
of
each
column
one
after
another
from
top
to
bottom
and
yet
she
was
able
to
read
out
every
word
from
the
she
held
in
her
hands
thus
truly
chewing
the
very
cud
of
journalism
this
always
seemed
to
us
in
a
small
but
practical
way
the
most
complete
and
signal
triumph
of
mind
over
matter
we
had
yet
achieved
not
indeed
that
we
could
read
much
we
had
so
much
to
talk
about
unfortunately
the
weak
part
of
magna
sed
apta
was
its
library
naturally
it
could
only
consist
of
books
that
one
or
the
other
of
us
had
read
when
awake
she
had
led
such
an
active
life
that
but
little
leisure
had
been
left
her
for
books
and
i
had
read
only
as
an
young
man
reads
who
is
fond
of
reading
however
such
books
as
we
read
were
made
the
most
of
and
so
magnificently
bound
that
even
their
authors
would
have
blushed
with
pride
and
pleasure
had
they
been
there
to
see
and
though
we
had
little
time
for
reading
them
over
again
we
could
enjoy
the
true
bibliophilous
delight
of
gazing
at
their
backs
and
taking
them
down
and
fingering
them
and
putting
them
carefully
back
again
in
most
of
these
treats
excursions
festivities
and
pleasures
of
the
fireside
mary
was
naturally
leader
and
hostess
it
could
scarcely
have
been
otherwise
there
was
once
a
famous
mary
of
whom
it
was
said
that
to
know
her
was
a
liberal
education
i
think
i
may
say
that
to
have
known
mary
seraskier
has
been
all
that
to
me
but
now
and
then
i
would
make
some
small
attempt
at
returning
her
hospitality
we
have
slummed
together
in
clerkenwell
smithfield
cow
cross
petticoat
lane
ratcliffe
highway
and
the
east
india
and
west
india
docks
she
has
been
with
me
to
penny
gaffs
and
to
greenwich
fair
and
cremorne
and
rosherville
gardens
and
liked
them
all
she
knew
pentonville
as
well
as
i
do
and
my
old
lodgings
there
where
we
have
both
leaned
over
my
former
shoulder
as
i
read
or
drew
it
was
she
who
rescued
from
oblivion
my
little
prophetic
song
about
the
chime
which
i
had
quite
forgotten
she
has
been
to
lintot
parties
and
found
them
most
amusing
especially
lintot
and
going
further
back
into
the
past
she
has
roamed
with
me
all
over
paris
and
climbed
with
me
the
towers
of
notre
dame
and
looked
in
vain
for
the
mystic
word
greek
anagkae
but
i
had
also
better
things
to
show
untravelled
as
i
was
she
had
never
seen
hampstead
heath
which
i
knew
by
heart
and
hampstead
heath
at
any
time
but
especially
on
a
sunny
morning
in
late
october
is
not
to
be
disdained
by
any
one
half
the
leaves
have
fallen
so
that
one
can
see
the
fading
glory
of
those
that
remain
yellow
and
brown
and
pale
and
hectic
red
shining
like
golden
guineas
and
bright
copper
coins
against
the
rich
dark
green
of
the
trees
that
mean
to
flourish
all
the
winter
through
like
the
tall
slanting
pines
near
the
spaniards
and
the
old
and
hedges
of
yew
and
holly
for
which
the
hampstead
gardens
are
famous
before
us
lies
a
sea
of
fern
gone
a
from
decay
in
which
are
isles
of
dark
green
gorse
and
little
trees
with
little
scarlet
and
orange
and
leaflets
fluttering
down
and
running
after
each
other
on
the
bright
grass
under
the
brisk
west
wind
which
makes
the
willows
rustle
and
turn
up
the
whites
of
their
leaves
in
pious
resignation
to
the
coming
change
with
its
pointed
spire
rises
blue
in
the
distance
and
distant
ridges
like
receding
waves
rise
into
blueness
one
after
the
other
out
of
the
mist
the
last
ridge
bluely
melting
into
space
in
the
midst
of
it
all
gleams
the
welsh
harp
lake
like
a
piece
of
sky
that
has
become
unstuck
and
tumbled
into
the
landscape
with
its
shiny
side
up
on
the
other
side
all
london
with
nothing
but
the
gilded
cross
of
paul
on
a
level
with
the
eye
it
lies
at
our
feet
as
paris
used
to
do
from
the
heights
of
passy
a
sight
to
make
true
dreamers
gaze
and
think
and
dream
the
more
and
there
we
sit
thinking
and
dreaming
and
gazing
our
fill
hand
in
hand
our
spirits
rushing
together
once
as
we
sat
we
heard
the
clatter
of
hoofs
behind
us
and
there
was
a
troop
of
my
old
regiment
out
exercising
invisible
to
all
but
ourselves
and
each
other
we
watched
the
wanton
troopers
riding
by
on
their
meek
black
chargers
first
came
the
cornet
a
apollo
a
gilded
youth
graceful
and
magnificent
to
the
eye
careless
fearless
but
stupid
harsh
and
proud
an
english
phébus
de
châteaupers
the
son
of
a
great
contractor
i
remembered
him
well
and
that
he
loved
me
not
then
the
rank
and
file
in
stable
jackets
most
of
them
but
for
a
stalwart
corporal
here
and
there
raw
lanky
youths
giving
promise
of
much
future
strength
and
each
leading
a
second
horse
and
among
them
longest
and
lankiest
of
them
all
but
ruddy
as
a
ploughboy
and
stolidly
whistling
on
revient
toujours
à
ses
premiers
amours
rode
my
former
self
a
sight
or
sound
that
seemed
to
touch
some
tender
chord
in
mary
nature
where
there
were
so
many
since
it
filled
her
eyes
with
tears
illustration
to
describe
in
full
a
filled
with
such
adventures
and
that
lasted
for
three
years
is
unnecessary
it
would
be
but
another
superficial
record
of
travel
by
another
unskilled
pen
and
what
a
pen
is
wanted
for
such
a
theme
it
was
not
mere
life
it
was
the
very
cream
and
essence
of
life
that
we
shared
with
each
other
all
the
toil
and
trouble
the
friction
and
fatigue
left
out
the
necessary
earthly
journey
through
time
and
space
from
one
joy
to
another
was
omitted
unless
such
a
journey
were
a
joy
in
itself
for
instance
a
pleasant
hour
can
be
spent
on
the
deck
of
a
splendid
steamer
as
it
cleaves
its
way
through
a
sapphire
tropical
sea
bound
for
some
lovely
west
indian
islet
with
a
good
cigar
and
the
dearest
companion
in
the
world
watching
the
dolphins
and
the
and
mildly
interesting
one
self
in
one
the
captain
the
crew
and
then
the
hour
spent
and
the
cigar
smoked
out
it
is
well
to
shut
one
eyes
and
have
one
self
quietly
lowered
down
the
side
of
the
vessel
into
a
beautiful
sledge
and
then
half
smothered
in
costly
furs
to
be
whirled
along
the
frozen
neva
to
a
ball
at
the
winter
palace
there
to
valse
with
one
mary
among
all
the
beauty
and
chivalry
of
petersburg
and
never
a
soul
to
find
fault
with
one
valsing
which
at
first
was
far
from
perfect
or
one
attire
which
was
not
that
of
the
fashionable
world
of
the
day
nor
was
mary
either
we
were
aesthetic
people
and
very
greek
who
made
for
ourselves
fashions
of
our
own
which
i
will
not
describe
illustration
where
have
we
not
waltzed
together
from
buckingham
palace
downward
i
confess
i
grew
to
take
a
delight
in
valsing
or
waltzing
or
whatever
it
is
properly
called
and
although
it
is
not
much
to
boast
of
i
may
say
that
after
a
year
or
two
no
better
dancer
than
i
was
to
be
found
in
all
vienna
and
here
by
the
way
i
may
mention
what
pleasure
it
gave
me
hand
in
hand
with
mary
of
course
as
usual
to
renew
and
improve
my
acquaintance
with
our
british
aristocracy
begun
so
agreeably
many
years
ago
at
lady
cray
concert
our
british
aristocracy
does
not
waltz
well
by
any
means
and
lacks
lightness
generally
but
it
may
gratify
and
encourage
some
of
its
members
to
hear
that
peter
ibbetson
soldier
architect
and
surveyor
convict
and
criminal
lunatic
who
has
had
unrivalled
opportunities
for
mixing
with
the
cream
of
european
society
considers
our
british
aristocracy
quite
the
and
aristocracy
of
them
all
and
the
most
sensible
and
the
least
exclusive
perhaps
the
most
sensible
the
least
exclusive
it
often
snubs
but
does
not
altogether
repulse
those
gifted
and
privileged
outsiders
who
just
for
the
honor
and
glory
of
the
thing
are
ever
so
ready
to
flatter
and
instruct
and
amuse
it
and
run
its
errands
and
fetch
and
carry
and
tumble
for
its
pleasure
and
even
to
marry
such
of
its
ugly
ducklings
or
shall
we
say
such
of
its
unprepossessing
cygnets
as
can
not
hope
to
mate
with
birds
of
their
own
feather
for
it
has
the
true
english
eye
for
physical
beauty
indeed
it
is
much
given
to
throw
the
handkerchief
successfully
of
course
and
most
fortunately
for
itself
beyond
the
pale
of
its
own
narrow
precincts
nay
beyond
the
broad
atlantic
even
to
the
land
where
beauty
and
dollars
are
to
be
found
in
such
happy
combination
nor
does
it
disdain
the
comeliness
of
the
daughters
of
israel
nor
their
shekels
nor
their
brains
nor
their
ancient
and
most
valuable
blood
it
knows
the
secret
virtue
of
that
mechanical
transfusion
of
fluids
familiar
to
science
under
the
name
of
endosmoses
and
exosmoses
i
hope
i
have
spelled
them
rightly
and
practises
the
same
whereby
it
shows
itself
wise
in
its
generation
and
will
endure
the
longer
which
can
not
be
very
long
peter
ibbetson
etc
for
one
wishes
it
no
manner
of
harm
but
to
return
with
all
these
temptations
of
travel
and
amusement
and
society
and
the
great
world
such
was
our
insatiable
fondness
for
the
pretty
place
of
our
childhood
and
all
its
associations
that
our
greatest
pleasure
of
all
was
to
live
our
old
life
over
again
and
again
and
make
gogo
and
mimsey
and
our
parents
and
cousins
and
le
major
go
through
their
old
paces
once
more
and
to
recall
old
paces
for
them
which
we
were
sometimes
able
to
do
out
of
stray
forgotten
bits
of
the
past
to
hunt
for
which
was
the
most
exciting
sport
in
the
world
our
tenderness
for
these
beloved
shades
increased
with
familiarity
we
could
see
all
the
charm
and
goodness
and
kindness
of
these
dear
fathers
and
mothers
of
ours
with
the
eyes
of
matured
experience
for
we
were
pretty
much
of
an
age
with
them
now
no
other
children
could
ever
say
as
much
since
the
world
began
and
how
few
young
parents
could
bear
such
a
scrutiny
as
ours
ah
what
would
we
not
have
given
to
extort
just
a
spark
of
recognition
but
that
was
impossible
or
to
have
been
able
to
whisper
just
a
word
of
warning
which
would
have
averted
the
impending
strokes
of
inexorable
fate
they
might
have
been
alive
now
perhaps
old
indeed
but
honored
and
loved
as
no
parents
ever
were
before
how
different
everything
would
have
been
alas
alas
and
of
all
things
in
the
world
we
never
tired
of
that
walk
through
the
avenue
and
park
and
bois
de
boulogne
to
the
mare
strolling
there
leisurely
on
an
early
spring
afternoon
just
in
time
to
spend
a
midsummer
hour
or
two
on
its
bank
and
watch
the
old
and
the
dytiscus
and
the
tadpoles
and
newts
and
see
the
frogs
jump
and
then
walking
home
at
dusk
in
the
of
my
old
home
and
then
back
to
war

moonlight
through
the
avenue
on
new
year
eve
in
snow
all
in
a
few
short
hours
dream
winds
and
dream
weathers
what
an
enchantment
and
all
real
soft
caressing
rains
that
do
not
wet
us
if
we
do
not
wish
them
to
sharp
frosts
that
brace
but
never
chill
blazing
suns
that
neither
scorch
nor
dazzle
blustering
winds
of
early
spring
that
seem
to
sweep
right
through
these
solid
frames
of
ours
and
thrill
us
to
the
very
marrow
with
the
old
heroic
excitement
and
ecstasy
we
knew
so
well
in
happy
childhood
but
can
no
longer
feel
now
when
awake
bland
summer
breezes
heavy
with
the
scent
of
long
lost
french
woods
and
fields
and
gardens
in
full
flower
swift
soft
moist
equinoctial
gales
blowing
from
the
orchards
of
meudon
or
the
old
market
gardens
of
suresnes
in
their
autumnal
decay
and
laden
we
do
not
know
why
with
strange
mysterious
troubling
reminiscence
too
subtle
and
elusive
to
be
expressed
in
any
tongue
too
sweet
for
any
words
and
then
the
dark
december
wind
that
comes
down
from
the
north
and
brings
the
short
early
twilights
and
the
snow
and
drives
us
home
pleasantly
shivering
to
the
and
the
hissing
logs

crunch
beneath
our
feet

if
we
turn
to
look
the
tracks
of
our
footsteps
have
disappeared

we
cast
no

the

by

the

we
are
wishing
them
a
happy

nearly
twenty
years

out
comes
gogo
from
the
seraskiers
with
mimsey
he
makes
a
snowball
and
throws
it
it
flies
straight
through
me
and
splashes
itself
on

broad
back
ah

returns
the
compliment

through

i
do
not
even
feel
it

i
are
as
solid
to

can
make

we
can
not
even
touch
these
dream
people
without
their
melting
away
into
thin
air
we
can
only
hear
and
see
them
but
that
in
perfection
there
goes
that
little
andré
corbin
the
poulterer
son
running
along
the
slippery
top
of
madame
pelé
garden
wall
which
is
nearly
ten
feet
high
good
heavens
cries
mary
stop
him
do
you
remember
when
he
gets
to
the
corner
he
fall
down
and
break
both
his
legs

rush
and

out
to
him

saute

cry
holding
out
my
arms
he
does
not
pay
the
slightest
attention
he
reaches
the
corner
followed
low
down
by
gogo
and
mimsey
who
are
beside
themselves
with
generous
envy
and
admiration
stimulated
by
their
applause
he
becomes
more
foolhardy
than
ever
and
even
tries
to
be
droll
and
standing
on
one
leg
sings
a
little
song
that
begins
maman
donné

then
suddenly
down
he
slips
poor
boy
and
breaks
both
his
legs
below
the
knee
on
an
iron
rail
whereby
he
becomes
a
cripple
for
life
all
this
sad
little
tragedy
of
a
eve
plays
itself
anew
the
sympathetic
crowd
collects
mimsey
and
gogo
weep
the
parents
arrive
and
the
good
little
doctor
larcher

i
look
on

so
impossible
it
seems
not
to
feel
that
we
might
have
prevented
it
all
we

alone
are
alive

substantial
in
all
this
strange
world
of
shadows

seem

far
as

see
no

alive
than
ourselves
they

we

our

hardly
more

what
our
real
existence
is

little
andré

who
has
just
broken
his
legs
for
us
over
again
illustration
and
so
back
to

both
saddened
by
this
deplorable
misadventure
to
muse
and
talk
and
marvel
over
these
wonders
penetrated
to
the
very
heart

by
a
dim
sense
of
some
vast
mysterious
power
latent
in
the
of
man
unheard
of
undreamed
of

linking
him
with
the
infinite
and
the
eternal
and
how
many
things
we
always
had
to
talk
about
besides
heaven
knows
i
am
not
a
brilliant
conversationalist
but
she
was
the
most
easily
amusable
person
in
the
world
interested
in
everything
that
interested
me
and
i
disdamaged
myself
to
use
one
of
her
of
the
sulky
silence
of
years
of
her
as
a
companion
it
is
not
for
me
to
speak
it
would
be
impertinent
and
even
ludicrous
for
a
person
in
my
position
to
dilate
on
the
social
gifts
of
the
famous
duchess
of
towers
incredible
as
it
may
appear
however
most
of
our
conversation
was
about
very
common
and
earthly
topics
her
homes
and
refuges
the
difficulties
of
their
management
her
eternal
want
of
money
her
many
schemes
and
plans
and
experiments
and
failures
and
disenchantments
in
all
of
which
i
naturally
took
a
very
warm
interest
and
then
my
jail
and
all
that
occurred
there
in
all
of
which
i
became
interested
myself
because
it
interested
her
so
passionately
she
knew
every
corner
of
it
that
i
knew
every
detail
of
the
life
there
the
name
appearance
and
history
of
almost
every
inmate
and
criticised
its
internal
economy
with
a
practical
knowledge
of
affairs
a
sagacity
at
which
i
never
ceased
to
marvel
one
of
my
drollest
recollections
is
of
a
visit
she
paid
there
the
by
some
famous
philanthropists
of
both
sexes
i
was
interviewed
by
them
all
as
the
model
prisoner
who
for
his
unorthodoxy
was
a
credit
to
the
institution
she
listened
demurely
to
my
intelligent
answers
when
i
was
questioned
as
to
my
bodily
health
and
asked
whether
i
had
any
complaints
to
make
complaints
never
was
so
thoroughly
satisfied
with
his
nest
so
healthy
so
happy
so
she
took
notes
all
the
time

eight
hours
before
we
had
been
strolling
hand
in
hand
through
the
uffizi
gallery
in
florence
eight
hours
later
we
should
be
in
each
other
arms
strange
to
relate
this
happiness
of
ours
so
deep
so
acute
so
transcendent
so
unmatched
in
all
the
history
of
human
affection
was
not
always
free
of
unreasonable
longings
and
regrets
man
is
never
so
blessed
but
what
he
would
have
his
blessedness
still
greater
the
reality
of
our
close
companionship
of
our
true
possession
of
each
other
during
our
allotted
time
was
absolute
complete
and
thorough
no
darby
that
ever
lived
can
ever
have
had
sweeter
warmer
more
tender
memories
of
any
joan
than
i
have
now
of
mary
seraskier
although
each
was
in
a
way
but
a
seeming
illusion
of
the
other
brain
the
illusion
was
no
illusion
for
us
it
was
an
illusion
that
showed
the
truth
as
does
the
illusion
of
sight
like
twin
kernels
in
one
shell
philipschen
as
mary
called
it
we
touched
at
more
points
and
were
closer
than
the
rest
of
mankind
with
each
of
them
a
separate
shell
of
his
own
we
tried
and
tested
this
in
every
way
we
could
devise
and
never
found
ourselves
at
fault
and
never
ceased
to
marvel
at
so
great
a
wonder
for
instance
i
received
letters
from
her
in
jail
and
answered
them
in
an
intricate
cipher
we
had
invented
and
perfected
together
entirely
during
sleep
and
referring
to
things
that
had
happened
to
us
both
when
together
a
footnote
a
several
of
these
letters
are
in
my
possession
madge
plunket
our
privileges
were
such
as
probably
no
human
beings
could
have
ever
enjoyed
before
time
and
space
were
annihilated
for
us
at
the
mere
wish
of
either
we
lived
in
a
palace
of
delight
all
conceivable
luxuries
were
ours
and
better
than
all
and
perennially
such
freshness
and
elation
as
belong
only
to
the
morning
of
life
and
such
a
love
for
each
other
the
result
of
circumstances
not
to
be
paralleled
as
time
could
never
slake
or
quench
till
death
should
come
and
part
us
all
this
and
more
was
our
portion
for
eight
hours
out
of
so
what
must
we
do
sometimes
but
fret
that
the
sixteen
hours
which
remained
did
not
belong
to
us
well
that
we
must
live
of
our
lives
apart
that
we
could
not
share
the
toils
and
troubles
of
our
waking
existence
as
we
shared
the
blissful
guerdon
of
our
seeming
sleep
the
glories
of
our
common
dream
and
then
we
would
lament
the
lost
years
we
had
spent
in
mutual
ignorance
and
separation
a
deplorable
waste
of
life
when
life
sleeping
or
waking
was
so
short
how
different
things
might
have
been
with
us
had
we
but
known
we
need
never
have
lost
sight
and
touch
of
each
other
we
might
have
grown
up
and
learned
and
worked
and
struggled
together
from
the
first
boy
and
girl
brother
and
sister
lovers
man
and
wife
and
yet
have
found
our
blessed
and
dwelt
in
it
just
the
same
children
might
have
been
born
to
us
sweet
children
comme
le
as
in
madame
perrault
fairy
tales
even
beautiful
and
good
as
their
mother
and
as
we
talked
of
these
imaginary
little
beings
and
tried
to
picture
them
we
felt
in
ourselves
such
a
stupendous
capacity
for
loving
the
same
that
we
would
fall
to
weeping
on
each
other
shoulders
full
well
i
knew
even
as
if
they
had
formed
a
part
of
my
own
personal
experience
all
the
passion
and
tenderness
all
the
wasted
anguish
of
her
brief
motherhood
the
very
ache
of
my
jealousy
that
she
should
have
borne
a
child
to
another
man
was
forgotten
in
that
keen
and
thorough
comprehension
ah
yes
that
hungry
love
that
woful
pity
which
not
to
know
is
hardly
quite
to
have
lived
childless
as
i
am
though
old
enough
to
be
a
grandfather
i
have
it
all
by
heart
never
could
we
hope
for
son
or
daughter
of
our
own
for
us
the
blessed
flower
of
love
in
rich
profuse
unfading
bloom
but
its
blessed
fruit
of
life
never
never
never
our
only
children
were
mimsey
and
gogo
between
whom
and
ourselves
was
an
impassable
gulf
and
who
were
unconscious
of
our
very
existence
except
for
mimsey
strange
consciousness
that
a
fairy
tarapatapoum
and
a
prince
charming
were
watching
over
them
all
this
would
always
end
as
it
could
not
but
end
in
our
realizing
the
more
fully
our
utter
dependence
on
each
other
for
all
that
made
life
not
only
worth
living
ingrates
that
we
were
but
a
heaven
on
earth
for
us
both
and
indeed
we
could
not
but
recognize
that
merely
thus
to
love
and
be
loved
was
in
itself
a
thing
so
immense
without
all
the
other
blessings
we
had
that
we
were
fain
to
tremble
at
our
audacity
in
daring
to
wish
for
more
thus
sped
three
years
and
would
have
sped
all
the
rest
perhaps
but
for
an
incident
that
made
an
epoch
in
our
joint
lives
and
turned
all
our
thoughts
and
energies
in
a
new
direction
part
six
illustration
some
petty
annoyance
to
which
i
had
been
subjected
by
one
of
the
prison
authorities
had
kept
me
awake
for
a
little
while
after
i
had
gone
to
bed
so
that
when
at
last
i
awoke
in
magna
sed
apta
and
lay
on
my
couch
there
with
that
feeling
of
coming
to
life
in
heaven
after
my
daily
round
of
work
in
an
earthly
jail
i
was
conscious
that
mary
was
there
already
making
coffee
the
fragrance
of
which
filled
the
room
and
softly
humming
a
tune
as
she
did
so
a
quaint
original
but
most
beautiful
tune
that
thrilled
me
with
indescribable
emotion
for
i
had
never
heard
it
with
the
bodily
ear
before
and
yet
it
was
as
familiar
to
me
as
god
save
the
queen
as
i
listened
with
rapt
ears
and
closed
eyes
wonderful
scenes
passed
before
my
mental
vision
the
beautiful
lady
of
my
childish
dreams
leading
a
small
child
by
the
hand
and
that
child
was
myself
the
pigeons
and
their
tower
the
stream
and
the
the
young
man
with
red
heels
to
his
shoes
a
very
fine
lady
very
tall
stout
and
magnificently
dressed
in
brocaded
silk
a
park
with
lawns
and
alleys
and
trees
cut
into
trim
formal
shapes
a
turreted
castle
all
kinds
of
charming
scenes
and
people
of
another
age
and
country
what
on
earth
is
that
wonderful
tune
mary
i
exclaimed
when
she
had
finished
it
it
my
favorite
tune
she
answered
i
seldom
hum
it
for
fear
of
wearing
away
its
charm
i
suppose
that
is
why
you
have
never
heard
it
before
is
it
lovely
i
been
trying
to
lull
you
awake
with
it
my
grandfather
the
violinist
used
to
play
it
with
variations
of
his
own
and
made
it
famous
in
his
time
but
it
was
never
published
and
it
now
forgotten
it
is
called
chant
du
triste
commensal
and
was
composed
by
his
grandmother
a
beautiful
french
woman
who
played
the
fiddle
too
but
not
as
a
profession
he
remembered
her
playing
it
when
he
was
a
child
and
she
was
quite
an
old
lady
just
as
i
remember
playing
it
when
i
was
a
girl
in
vienna
and
he
was
a
old
man
she
used
to
play
holding
her
fiddle
downward
on
her
knee
it
seems
and
always
played
in
perfect
tune
quite
in
the
middle
of
the
note
and
with
excellent
taste
and
expression
it
was
her
playing
that
decided
his
career
but
she
was
like
hamilton
for
this
was
the
only
thing
she
ever
composed
she
composed
it
under
great
grief
and
excitement
just
after
her
husband
had
died
from
the
bite
of
a
wolf
and
just
before
the
birth
of
her
her
only
children
one
of
whom
was
my
and
what
was
this
wonderful
old
lady
name
gatienne
aubéry
she
married
a
breton
squire
called
budes
who
was
a
near
prest
in
anjou
that
is
he
made
glass
decanters
tumblers
and
all
that
i
suppose
in
spite
of
his
nobility
it
was
not
considered
derogatory
to
do
so
indeed
it
was
the
only
trade
permitted
to
the
and
one
had
to
be
at
least
a
squire
to
engage
in
it
she
was
a
very
notable
woman
belle
as
she
was
called
and
she
managed
the
glass
factory
for
many
years
after
her
death
and
made
lots
of
money
for
her
two
daughters
how
strange
i
exclaimed
gatienne
aubéry
dame
du
brail
budes
the
names
are
quite
familiar
to
me
mathurin
budes
seigneur
de
monhoudéard
et
de
verny
le
moustier
yes
that
it
how
wonderful
that
you
should
know
one
daughter
jeanne
married
my
greatgrandfather
an
officer
in
the
hungarian
army
and
seraskier
the
fiddler
was
their
only
child
the
other
so
like
her
sister
that
only
her
mother
could
distinguish
them
was
called
anne
and
married
a
comte
de
bois
something
boismorinel
why
all
those
names
are
in
my
family
too
my
father
used
to
make
me
paint
their
arms
and
quarterings
when
i
was
a
child
on
sunday
mornings
to
keep
me
quiet
perhaps
we
are
related
by
blood
you
and
i
oh
that
would
be
too
delightful
said
mary
i
wonder
how
we
could
find
out
have
you
no
family
papers
there
were
lots
of
them
in
a
trunk
but
i
do
know
where
they
are
now
what
good
would
family
papers
have
been
to
me
ibbetson
took
charge
of
them
when
i
changed
my
name
i
suppose
his
lawyers
have
got
them
happy
thought
we
will
do
without
lawyers
let
us
go
round
to
your
old
house
and
make
gogo
paint
the
quarterings
over
again
for
us
and
look
over
his
shoulder
happy
thought
indeed
we
drank
our
coffee
and
went
straight
to
my
old
house
with
the
wish
immediate
father
to
the
deed
that
gogo
should
be
there
once
more
engaged
in
his
long
forgotten
accomplishment
of
painting
coats
of
arms
it
was
a
beautiful
sunday
morning
and
we
found
gogo
hard
at
work
at
a
small
table
by
an
open
window
the
floor
was
covered
with
old
deeds
and
parchments
and
family
papers
and
le
beau
pasquier
at
another
table
was
deep
in
his
own
pedigree
making
notes
on
the
margin
an
occupation
in
which
he
delighted
and
unconsciously
humming
as
he
did
so
the
sunny
room
was
filled
with
the
penetrating
soft
sound
of
his
voice
as
a
conservatory
is
filled
with
the
scent
of
its
flowers
by
the
strangest
inconsistency
my
dear
father
a
genuine
republican
at
heart
for
all
his
fancied
loyalty
to
the
white
lily
of
the
bourbons
a
scientist
who
in
reality
was
far
more
impressed
by
a
clever
and
industrious
french
mechanic
than
by
a
prince
and
would
i
think
have
preferred
the
former
friendship
and
society
yet
took
both
a
pleasure
and
a
pride
in
his
quaint
old
parchments
and
obscure
quarterings
so
would
i
perhaps
if
things
had
gone
differently
with
me
for
what
true
democrat
however
intolerant
of
such
weakness
in
others
ever
thinks
lightly
of
his
own
personal
claims
to
aristocratic
descent
shadowy
as
these
may
be
he
was
fond
of
such
proverbs
and
aphorisms
as
noblesse
oblige
bon
sang
ne
sait
mentir
bon
chien
chasse
de
race
and
had
even
invented
a
little
aphorism
of
his
own
to
comfort
him
when
he
was
extra
hard
up
bon
gentilhomme
jamais
honte
de
la
misère
all
of
which
sayings
to
do
him
justice
he
reserved
for
home
consumption
exclusively
and
he
would
have
been
the
first
to
laugh
on
hearing
them
in
the
mouth
of
any
one
else
of
his
one
great
gift
the
treasure
in
his
throat
he
thought
absolutely
nothing
at
all
ce

de

was
coloring
the
quarterings
of
the

it
was
called
in
a
printed
book

maine
et

according
to
the
instructions
that
were
given
underneath
he
used
one
of
madame
liard
boxes
and
the
tints
left
much
to
be
desired
we
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
read
the
picturesque
old
jargon
which
sounds
even
prettier
and
more
comforting
and
more
idiotic
in
french
than
in
english
it
ran
thus

were
able

bottled
stout
vient
à
la
and
we
spent
the
rest
of
the
hours
allotted
to
us
that
night
in
evolving
such
visions
as
we
could
from
the
old
tune
le
chant
du
triste
commensal
with
varying
success
she
humming
it
accompanying
herself
on
the
piano
in
her
masterly
way
with
one
hand
and
seeing
all
that
i
saw
by
holding
my
hand
with
the
other
by
slow
degrees
the
scenes
and
people
evoked
grew
less
dim
and
whenever
the
splendid
and
important
lady
whom
we
soon
identified
for
certain
as
gatienne
our
common
appeared
la
belle
verrière
de
verny
le
moustier
she
was
more
distinct
than
the
others
no
doubt
because
we
both
had
part
and
parcel
in
her
individuality
and
also
because
her
individuality
was
so
strongly
marked
and
before
i
was
called
away
at
the
inexorable
hour
we
had
the
supreme
satisfaction
of
seeing
her
play
the
fiddle
to
a
shadowy
company
of
patched
and
powdered
and
bewigged
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
seemed
to
take
much
sympathetic
delight
in
her
performance
and
actually
even
of
just
hearing
the
thin
unearthly
tones
of
that
most
original
and
exquisite
melody
le
chant
du
triste
commensal
to
a
quite
inaudible
accompaniment
on
the
spinet
by
her
daughter
evidently
anne
hérault
comtesse
de
boismorinel
budes
while
the
small
child
jeanne
de
boismorinel
afterwards
dame
pasquier
de
la
marière
listened
with
dreamy
rapture
and
just
as
mary
had
said
she
played
her
fiddle
with
its
body
downward
and
resting
on
her
knees
as
though
it
had
been
an
undersized
i
then
vaguely
remembered
having
dreamed
of
such
a
figure
when
a
small
child
within
hours
of
this
strange
adventure
the
practical
and
mary
had
started
in
the
flesh
and
with
her
maid
for
that
part
of
france
where
these
my
ancestors
had
lived
and
within
a
fortnight
she
had
made
herself
mistress
of
all
my
french
family
history
and
had
visited
such
of
the
different
houses
of
my
kin
as
were
still
in
existence
the
turreted
castle
of
my
childish
dreams
which
with
the
adjacent
was
still
called
verny
le
moustier
was
one
of
these
she
found
it
in
the
possession
of
a
certain
count
hector
du
chamorin
whose
grandfather
had
purchased
it
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
he
had
built
an
entirely
new
plant
and
made
it
one
of
the
first
in
western
france
but
the
old
turreted
de
still
remained
and
his
foreman
lived
there
with
his
wife
and
family
the
had
been
pulled
down
to
make
room
for
a
shed
with
a
and
the
whole
aspect
of
the
place
was
revolutionized
but
the
stream
and
the
latter
a
mere
picturesque
ruin
were
still
there
the
stream
was
however
little
more
than
a
ditch
some
ten
feet
deep
and
twenty
broad
with
a
fringe
of
gnarled
and
twisted
willows
and
alders
many
of
them
dead
it
was
called
le
brail
and
had
given
its
name
to
my
property
whence
it
had
issued
thirty
miles
away
and
many
hundred
years
ago
but
the
old
château

manor
of
the

had
become
a

château

its
walled
park

with
its
beautiful
tall
hexagonal
tower
dated
and
visible
for
miles
around

now
a
prosperous

were
still
to
be

in
the
country
probably
distant
kinsmen
of
and
mine
were
lawyers
doctors
or
priests
or
had
gone
into
trade
and
become
respectably
uninteresting
such
as
they
were
they
would
scarcely
have
cared
to
claim
kinship
with
such
as
i
but
a
hundred
years
ago
and
more
these
were
names
of
importance
in
maine
and
anjou
their
bearers
were
descended
for
the
most
part
from
younger
branches
of
houses
which
in
the
middle
ages
had
intermarried
with
all
there
was
of
the
best
in
france
and
although
they
were
looked
down
upon
by
the
of
the
court
and
versailles
as
were
all
the
provincial
nobility
they
held
their
own

hunting
and
shooting
with

other

and
fiddling
and
making
love

intermarrying

blowing
glass
and
growing
richer
and
richer

the
revolution
came
and
blew
them
and
their
glass
into
space
and
with
them
many
greater
than
themselves
but
few
better
and
all
record
of
them
and
of
their
doings

and
genial
people
as
they
were
is
lost
and
can
only
be
recalled
by
a
dream
verny
le
moustier
was
not
the
least
interesting
of
these
old
manors
it
had
been
built
three
hundred
years
ago
on
the
site
of
a
still
older
monastery
whence
its
name
the
ruined
walls
of
the
old
abbey
were
and
are
still
extant
in
the
covered
with
apricot
and
pear
and
peach
trees
which
had
been
sown
or
planted
by
our
common
ancestress
when
she
was
a
bride
count
hector
who
took
a
great
pleasure
in
explaining
all
the
past
history
of
the
place
to
mary
had
built
himself
a
fine
new
house
in
what
remained
of
the
old
park
and
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
from
the
old
every
room
of
the
latter
was
shown
to
her
old
wood
panels
still
remained
prettily
painted
in
a
fashion
old
documents
and
parchment
deeds
and
leases
concerning
farms
and
the
like
were
brought
out
for
her
inspection
signed
by
my
grandfather
pasquier
my
boismorinel
and
our
and
her
husband
mathurin
budes
the
lord
of
verny
le
moustier
and
the
tradition
of
gatienne
belle
also
nicknamed
reine
de
it
seems
still
lingered
in
the
county
and
many
old
people
still
remembered
more
or
less
correctly
le
chant
du
triste
commensal
which
a
hundred
years
ago
had
been
in
everybody
mouth
she
was
said
to
have
been
the
tallest
and
handsomest
woman
in
anjou
of
an
imperious
will
and
very
masculine
character
but
immensely
popular
among
rich
and
poor
alike
of
indomitable
energy
and
with
a
finger
in
every
pie
but
always
more
for
the
good
of
others
than
her
own
a
typical
managing
french
woman
and
an
exquisite
musician
to
boot
such
was
our
common
ancestress
from
whom
no
doubt
we
drew
our
love
of
music
and
our
strange
almost
hysterical
susceptibility
to
the
power
of
sound
from
whom
had
issued
those
two
born
nightingales
of
our
race
seraskier
the
violinist
and
my
father
the
singer
and
strange
to
say
her
eyebrows
met
at
the
bridge
of
her
nose
just
like
mine
and
from
under
them
beamed
the
luminous
eyes
of
mary
that
suffered
eclipse
whenever
their
owners
laughed
or
smiled
illustration
during
this
interesting
journey
of
mary
in
the
flesh
we
met
every
night
at
magna
sed
apta
in
the
spirit
as
usual
and
i
was
made
to
participate
in
every
incident
of
it
we
sat
by
the
magic
window
and
had
for
our
entertainment
now
the
verrerie
de
verny
le
moustier
in
its
present
state
all
full
of
modern
life
color
and
sound
steam
and
gas
as
she
had
seen
it
a
few
hours
before
now
the
old
château
as
it
was
a
hundred
years
ago
dim
and
indistinct
as
though
seen
by
nearsighted
eyes
at
the
close
of
a
gray
misty
afternoon
in
late
autumn
through
a
blurred
with
busy
but
silent
shadows
moving
about
silent
because
at
first
we
could
not
hear
their
speech
it
was
too
thin
for
our
mortal
ears
even
in
this
dream
within
our
dream
only
gatienne
the
authoritative
and
commanding
gatienne
was
faintly
audible
then
we
would
go
down
and
mix
with
them
thus
at
one
moment
we
would
be
in
the
midst
of
a
charming
french
family
group
of
shadows
gatienne
with
her
lovely
jeanne
and
anne
and
her
gardeners
round
her
all
trailing
young
peach
and
apricot
trees
against
what
still
remained
of
the
ancient
buttresses
and
walls
of
the
abbaye
de
verny
le
moustier
all
this
more
than
a
hundred
years
ago
the
pale
sun
of
a
noon
casting
the
fainter
shadows
of
these
faint
shadows
on
the
shadowy
then
presto
changing
the
scene
as
one
changes
a
slide
in
a
we
would
skip
a
century
and
behold
another
french
family
group
equally
charming
on
the
spot
but
in
the
garb
of
and
no
longer
shadowy
or
mute
by
any
means
little
trees
have
grown
big
big
trees
have
disappeared
to
make
place
for
industrious
workshops
and
machinery
but
the
old
abbey
walls
have
been
respected
and
gay
genial
father
and
handsome
mother
and
lovely
daughters
all
pressing
on
la
belle
duchesse
anglaise
peaches
and
apricots
of
her
growing
for
this
amiable
family
of
the
chamorin
became
devoted
to
mary
in
a
very
short
time
that
is
the
very
moment
they
first
saw
her
and
she
never
forgot
their
kindness
courtesy
and
hospitality
they
made
her
feel
in
five
minutes
as
though
she
had
known
them
for
many
years
i
may
as
well
state
here
that
a
few
months
later
she
received
from
mademoiselle
du
chamorin
with
a
charming
letter
the
identical
violin
that
had
once
belonged
to
belle
and
which
count
hector
had
found
in
the
possession
of
an
old
farmer
the
of
gatienne
coachman
and
had
purchased
that
he
might
present
it
as
a
gift
to
her
descendant
the
duchess
of
towers
it
is
now
mine
alas
i
can
not
play
it
but
it
amuses
and
comforts
me
to
hold
in
my
hand
when
broad
and
wide
awake
an
instrument
that
mary
and
i
have
so
often
heard
and
seen
in
our
dream
and
which
has
so
often
rung
in
days
with
the
strange
melody
that
has
had
so
great
an
influence
on
our
lives
its
aspect
shape
and
color
every
mark
and
stain
of
it
were
familiar
to
us
before
we
had
ever
seen
it
with
the
bodily
eye
or
handled
it
with
the
hand
of
flesh
it
thus
came
straight
to
us
out
of
the
dim
and
distant
past
heralded
by
the
ghost
of
itself
to
return
gradually
by
practice
and
the
concentration
of
our
united
will
the
figures
grew
to
gain
substance
and
color
and
their
voices
became
perceptible
till
at
length
there
arrived
a
day
when
we
could
move
among
them
and
hear
them
and
see
them
as
distinctly
as
we
could
our
own
immediate
progenitors
close
by
as
gogo
and
mimsey
as
monsieur
le
major
and
the
rest
the
child
who
went
about
hand
in
hand
with
the
lady
whose
hair
was
only
powdered
and
fed
the
pigeons
was
my
grandmother
jeanne
de
boismorinel
who
married
françois
pasquier
de
la
marière
it
was
her
father
who
wore
red
heels
to
his
shoes
and
made
her
believe
she
could
manufacture
little
in
colored
glass
she
had
lived
again
in
me
whenever
as
a
child
i
had
dreamed
that
exquisite
dream
i
could
now
evoke
her
at
will
and
with
her
many
buried
memories
were
called
out
of
nothingness
into
life
among
other
wonderful
things
i
heard
the
gentleman
de
boismorinel
my
sing
beautiful
old
songs
by
lulli
and
others
to
the
spinet
which
he
played
charmingly
a
rare
accomplishment
in
those
days
and
lo
these
tunes
were
tunes
that
had
risen
oft
and
unbidden
in
my
consciousness
and
i
had
fondly
imagined
that
i
had
composed
them
myself
little
impromptus
of
my
own
and
lo
again
his
voice
thin
high
nasal
but
very
sympathetic
and
musical
was
that
never
still
small
voice
that
has
been
singing
unremittingly
for
more
than
half
a
century
in
the
unswept
ungarnished
corner
of
my
brain
where
all
the
cobwebs
are
illustration
that
never
still
small
voice
and
these
cobwebs
well
i
soon
became
aware
by
deeply
diving
into
my
inner
consciousness
when
awake
and
at
my
daily
prison
toil
which
left
the
mind
singularly
clear
and
free
that
i
was
full
quite
full
of
slight
elusive
reminiscences
which
were
neither
of
my
waking
life
nor
of
my
with
mary
reminiscences
of
during
sleep
and
belonging
to
the
period
of
my
childhood
and
early
youth
which
no
doubt
had
been
forgotten
when
i
woke
at
which
time
i
could
only
remember
the
surface
dreams
that
had
just
preceded
my
waking
ponds
rivers
bridges
roads
and
streams
avenues
of
trees
arbors
windmills
and
corridors
and
rooms
church
functions
village
fairs
festivities
men
and
women
and
animals
all
of
another
time
and
of
a
country
where
i
had
never
set
my
foot
were
familiar
to
my
remembrance
i
had
but
to
dive
deep
enough
into
myself
and
there
they
were
and
when
night
came
and
sleep
and
magna
sed
apta
i
could
them
all
and
make
them
real
and
complete
for
mary
and
myself
that
these
subtle
reminiscences
were
true
antenatal
memories
was
soon
proved
by
my
excursions
with
mary
into
the
past
and
her
experience
of
such
reminiscences
and
their
corroboration
were
just
as
my
own
we
have
heard
and
seen
her
grandfather
play
the
chant
du
triste
commensal
to
crowded
applauded
to
the
echo
by
men
and
women
long
dead
and
buried
and
forgotten
now
i
believe
such
reminiscences
to
form
part
of
the
of
others
as
well
as
mary
and
mine
and
that
by
perseverance
in
many
will
succeed
in
reaching
them
perhaps
even
more
easily
and
completely
than
we
have
done
it
is
something
like
listening
for
the
overtones
of
a
musical
note
we
do
not
hear
them
at
first
though
they
are
there
clamoring
for
recognition
and
when
at
last
we
hear
them
we
wonder
at
our
former
obtuseness
so
distinct
are
they
let
a
man
with
an
average
ear
however
uncultivated
strike
the
c
low
down
on
a
good
keeping
his
foot
on
the
loud
pedal
at
first
he
will
hear
nothing
but
the
rich
fundamental
note
but
let
him
become
of
certain
other
notes
for
instance
of
the
c
in
the
octave
immediately
above
then
the
g
immediately
above
that
then
the
e
higher
still
he
will
hear
them
all
in
time
as
clearly
as
the
note
originally
struck
and
finally
a
shrill
little
ghostly
and
quite
importunate
b
flat
in
the
treble
will
pulsate
so
loudly
in
his
ear
that
he
will
never
cease
to
hear
it
whenever
that
low
c
is
sounded
by
just
such
a
process
only
with
infinitely
more
pains
and
in
the
end
with
what
pleasure
and
surprise
will
he
grow
aware
in
time
of
a
dim
latent
antenatal
experience
that
underlies
his
own
personal
experience
of
this
life
we
also
found
that
we
were
able
not
only
to
assist
as
mere
spectators
at
such
past
scenes
as
i
have
described
and
they
were
endless
but
also
to
identify
ourselves
occasionally
with
the
actors
and
cease
for
the
moment
to
be
mary
seraskier
and
peter
ibbetson
notably
was
this
the
case
with
gatienne
we
could
each
be
gatienne
for
a
space
though
never
both
of
us
together
and
when
we
resumed
our
own
personality
again
we
carried
back
with
it
a
portion
of
hers
never
to
be
lost
again
a
strange
phenomenon
if
the
reader
will
but
think
of
it
and
constituting
the
germ
of
a
comparative
personal
immortality
on
earth
at
my
work
in
prison
even
i
could
distinctly
remember
having
been
gatienne
so
that
for
the
time
being
gatienne
a
provincial
french
woman
who
lived
a
hundred
years
ago
was
contentedly
undergoing
penal
servitude
in
an
english
jail
during
the
latter
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
a
questionable
privilege
perhaps
but
to
make
up
for
it
when
she
was
not
alive
in
me
she
could
be
brought
to
life
in
mary
only
in
one
at
a
time
it
seemed
and
travel
by
rail
and
steamer
and
know
the
uses
of
gas
and
electricity
and
read
the
telegrams
of
our
special
correspondents
in
the
and
taste
her
nineteenth
century
under
more
favorable
conditions
thus
we
took
belle
by
turns
and
she
saw
and
heard
things
she
little
dreamed
of
a
hundred
years
ago
besides
she
was
made
to
share
in
the
glories
of
magna
sed
apta
and
the
better
we
knew
her
the
more
we
loved
her
she
was
a
very
nice
person
to
descend
from
and
mary
and
i
were
well
agreed
that
we
could
not
have
chosen
a
better
and
wondered
what
each
of
our
seven
others
was
like
for
we
had
fifteen
of
these
between
us
and
as
many
thirty
and
had
made
us
what
we
were
it
was
no
good
fighting
against
them
and
the
millions
at
their
backs
which
of
them
all
strong
but
gentle
and
shy
and
hating
the
very
sight
of
blood
yet
saw
scarlet
when
he
was
roused
and
thirsted
for
the
blood
of
his
foe
which
of
them
all
passionate
and
tender
but
proud
and
chaste
and
with
the
world
at
her
feet
was
yet
ready
to
throw
her
cap
over
the
windmills
and
give
up
all
for
love
deeming
the
world
well
lost
that
we
could
have
thus
identified
ourselves
only
more
easily
and
thoroughly
with
our
own
more
immediate
progenitors
we
felt
certain
enough
but
after
mature
thought
we
resolved
to
desist
from
any
further
attempt
at
such
transfusion
of
identity
for
sacred
reasons
of
discretion
which
the
reader
will
appreciate
but
that
this
will
be
done
some
day
now
the
way
has
been
made
clear
and
also
that
the
inconveniences
and
possible
abuses
of
such
a
faculty
will
be
obviated
or
minimized
by
the
ingenuity
of
mankind
is
to
my
mind
a
foregone
conclusion
it
is
too
valuable
a
faculty
to
be
left
in
abeyance
and
i
leave
the
probable
and
possible
consequences
of
its
culture
to
the
imagination
merely
pointing
out
to
him
as
an
inducement
to
cultivate
that
faculty
in
himself
that
if
anything
can
keep
us
well
within
the
thorny
path
that
leads
to
happiness
and
virtue
it
is
the
certainty
that
those
who
come
after
us
will
remember
having
been
ourselves
if
only
in
a
dream
even
as
the
chicken
has
remembered
in
its
egg
the
use
of
eyes
and
ears
and
the
rest
out
of
the
fulness
of
its
long
antenatal
experience
and
more
fortunate
than
the
helpless
human
infant
in
this
respect
can
enter
on
the
business
and
pleasures
of
its
brief
irresponsible
existence
at
once
wherefore
oh
reader
if
you
be
but
sound
in
mind
and
body
it
most
seriously
behooves
you
not
only
for
the
sake
of
those
who
come
after
you
but
your
own
to
go
forth
and
multiply
exceedingly
to
marry
early
and
much
and
often
and
to
select
the
very
best
of
your
kind
in
the
opposite
sex
for
this
most
precious
excellent
and
blessed
purpose
that
all
your
future
reincarnations
and
hers
however
brief
may
be
many
and
bring
you
not
only
joy
and
peace
and
pleasurable
wonderment
and
recreation
but
the
priceless
guerdon
of
for
whoever
remembers
having
once
been
you
wakes
you
for
the
nonce
out
of
nirvana
shall
we
say
his
strength
his
beauty
and
his
wit
are
yours
and
the
felicity
he
derives
from
them
in
this
earthly
life
is
for
you
to
share
whenever
this
subtle
remembrance
of
you
stirs
in
his
consciousness
and
you
can
never
quite
sink
back
again
into
nirvana
till
all
your
future
wakers
shall
cease
to
be
it
is
like
a
little
french
game
we
used
to
play
at
passy
and
which
is
not
bad
for
a
dark
rainy
afternoon
people
sit
all
round
in
a
circle
and
each
hands
on
to
his
neighbor
a
spill
or
a
just
blown
out
but
in
which
a
little
live
spark
still
lingers
saying
as
he
does
so
petit
bonhomme
vit
encore
and
he
in
whose
hand
the
spark
becomes
extinct
has
to
pay
forfeit
and
retire
hélas
petit
bonhomme
plus
pauv
petit
bonhomme
ever
thus
may
a
little
live
spark
of
your
own
individual
consciousness
when
the
full
quick
flame
of
your
actual
life
here
below
is
extinguished
be
handed
down
mildly
incandescent
to
your
remotest
posterity
may
it
never
quite
go
out
it
need
not
may
you
ever
be
able
to
say
of
yourself
from
generation
to
generation
petit
bonhomme
vit
encore
and
still
keep
one
finger
at
least
in
the
pleasant
earthly
pie
and
reader
remember
so
to
order
your
life
on
earth
that
the
memory
of
you
like
that
of
gatienne
la
belle
verrière
de
verny
le
moustier
may
smell
sweet
and
blossom
in
the
dust
a
memory
pleasant
to
recall
to
this
end
that
its
recallings
and
its
recallers
may
be
as
numerous
as
filial
love
and
ancestral
pride
can
make
them
and
oh
looking
as
did
be
tender
to
the
failings
of
your
forbears
who
little
guessed
when
alive
that
the
secrets
of
their
long
buried
hearts
should
one
day
be
revealed
to
their
faults
are
really
your
own
like
the
faults
of
your
innocent
ignorant
childhood
so
to
say
when
you
did
not
know
better
as
you
do
now
or
will
soon
thanks
to
le
chant
du
triste
commensal
wherefore
also
beware
and
be
warned
in
time
ye
tenth
transmitters
of
a
foolish
face
ye
reckless
begetters
of
diseased
or
puny
bodies
with
hearts
and
brains
to
match
far
down
the
corridors
of
time
shall
retribution
follow
in
your
footsteps
and
overtake
you
at
every
turn
most
remorselessly
most
vindictively
will
you
be
aroused
in
sleepless
hours
of
unbearable
misery
nightmares
from
your
false
uneasy
dream
of
death
to
participate
in
an
inheritance
of
woe
still
worse
than
yours
worse
with
all
the
accumulated
interest
of
long
years
and
centuries
of
iniquitous
and
poisoned
by
the
sting
of
a
that
shall
never
cease
till
the
last
of
your
tainted
progeny
dies
out
and
finds
his
true
nirvana
and
yours
in
the
dim
forgetful
depths
of
interstellar
space
and
here
let
me
most
conscientiously
affirm
that
partly
from
my
keen
sense
of
the
solemnity
of
such
an
appeal
and
the
grave
responsibility
i
take
upon
myself
in
making
it
but
more
especially
in
order
to
impress
you
oh
reader
with
the
full
significance
of
this
apocalyptic
and
somewhat
minatory
utterance
that
it
may
haunt
your
finer
sense
during
your
midnight
hours
of
introspective
i
have
done
my
best
my
very
best
to
couch
it
in
the
obscurest
and
most
unintelligible
phraseology
i
could
invent
if
i
have
failed
to
do
this
if
i
have
unintentionally
made
any
part
of
my
meaning
clear
if
i
have
once
deviated
by
mistake
into
what
might
almost
appear
like
sense
mere
it
is
the
fault
of
my
and
wholly
imperfect
education
i
am
but
a
poor
scribe
thus
roughly
have
i
tried
to
give
an
account
of
this
the
most
important
of
our
joint
discoveries
in
the
strange
new
world
revealed
to
us
by
chance
more
than
twenty
years
of
our
united
lives
have
been
devoted
to
the
following
out
of
this
slender
clew
with
what
surprising
results
will
i
trust
be
seen
in
subsequent
volumes
we
have
not
had
time
to
attempt
the
unravelling
of
our
english
ancestry
as
well
the
crays
and
the
desmonds
the
ibbetsons
and
biddulphs
which
connects
us
with
the
past
history
of
england
the
farther
we
got
back
into
france
the
more
fascinating
it
became
and
the
easier
and
the
more
difficult
to
leave
what
an
unexampled
experience
has
been
ours
to
think
that
we
have
seen
actually
seen
nos
propres
yeux
napoleon
bonaparte
himself
the
of
the
world
on
the
very
pinnacle
of
his
pride
and
power
in
his
little
cocked
hat
and
gray
overcoat
astride
his
white
charger
with
all
his
staff
around
him
just
as
he
has
been
so
often
painted
surely
the
most
impressive
unforgettable
ineffaceable
little
figure
in
all
modern
history
and
clothed
in
the
most
cunningly
imagined
that
ever
theatrical
costumier
devised
to
catch
the
public
eye
and
haunt
the
public
memory
for
ages
and
ages
yet
to
come
it
is
a
singularly
new
piquant
and
exciting
sensation
to
stare
in
person
and
as
in
the
present
at
bygone
actualities
and
be
able
to
foretell
the
past
and
remember
the
future
all
in
one
to
think
that
we
have
even
beheld
him
before
he
was
first
consul
slim
and
pale
his
lank
hair
dangling
down
his
neck
and
cheeks
if
possible
more
impressive
still
as
innocent
as
a
child
of
all
that
lay
before
him
europe
at
his
feet
the
throne
helena
the
iron
english
duke
the
pinnacle
turned
into
a
pillory
so
soon
o
corse
à
cheveux
plats
que
la
france
était
belle
au
soleil
de
messidor
and
mirabeau
and
robespierre
and
danton
and
marat
and
charlotte
corday
we
have
seen
them
too
and
marie
antoinette
and
the
and
the
beautiful
head
of
lamballe
on
its
pike
and
watched
the
tumbrils
go
by
to
the
place
du
carrousel
and
gazed
at
the
guillotine
by
moonlight
silent
and
our
very
hearts
in
our
mouths
and
in
the
midst
of
it
all
ridiculous
stray
memories
of
madame
tussaud
would
come
stealing
into
our
ghastly
dream
of
blood
and
retribution
mixing
up
past
and
present
and
future
in
a
manner
not
to
be
described
and
making
us
smile
through
our
tears
then
we
were
present
several
times
at
the
taking
of
the
bastille
and
indeed
witnessed
most
of
the
stormy
scenes
of
that
stormy
time
with
our
carlyle
in
our
hands
and
often
have
we
thought
and
with
many
a
hearty
laugh
what
fun
it
must
be
to
write
immortal
histories
with
never
an
to
contradict
you
and
going
further
back
we
have
haunted
versailles
in
the
days
of
its
splendor
and
drunk
our
fill
of
all
the
glories
of
the
court
of
louis
xiv
what
imposing
ceremonials
what
stupendous
royal
functions
have
we
not
attended
where
all
the
beauty
wit
and
chivalry
of
france
prostrate
with
reverence
and
awe
as
in
the
very
presence
of
a
god
did
loyal
homage
to
the
greatest
monarch
this
world
has
ever
seen
while
we
sat
by
on
the
very
steps
of
his
throne
as
he
solemnly
gave
out
his
royal
command
and
laughed
aloud
under
his
very
nose
the
shallow
silly
pompous
little
snob
and
longed
to
pull
it
and
tried
to
disinfect
his
greasy
wig
with
wholesome
whiffs
from
a
regalia
nothing
of
that
foolish
but
fascinating
period
escaped
us
town
hamlet
river
forest
and
field
royal
palace
princely
castle
and
starving
peasants
hut
pulpit
stage
and
salon
port
camp
and
marketplace
tribunal
and
university
factory
shop
studio
smithy
tavern
and
and
den
of
thieves
convent
and
jail
and
and
what
not
all
and
at
every
successive
step
our
once
desponding
souls
have
swelled
with
joy
and
pride
and
hope
at
the
triumphs
of
our
own
day
all
along
the
line
yea
even
though
we
have
heard
the
illustrious
bossuet
preach
and
applauded
molière
in
one
of
his
own
plays
and
gazed
at
and
listened
to
and
almost
forgiven
racine
and
corneille
and
boileau
and
fénélon
and
the
good
lafontaine
those
five
ruthless
persecutors
of
our
own
innocent
french
childhood
and
still
ascending
the
stream
of
time
we
have
hobnobbed
with
montaigne
and
rabelais
and
been
personally
bored
by
malherbe
and
sat
at
ronsard
feet
and
ridden
by
froissart
side
and
slummed
with
françois
villon
in
what
enchanted
slums
françois
villon
think
of
that
ye
fond
british
bards
and
bardlets
of
ye
translators
and
imitators
of
that
lament
the
immortal
des
dames
du
temps
and
while
i
speak
of
it
i
may
as
well
mention
that
we
have
seen
them
too
or
some
of
them
those
fair
ladies
had
never
seen
and
who
had
already
melted
away
before
his
coming
like
the
snows
of
yester
year
neiges
bertha
with
the
big
feet
joan
of
arc
the
good
lorrainer
what
would
she
think
of
her
native
province
now
the
very
learned
héloïse
for
love
of
whom
one
peter
esbaillart
or
abélard
a
more
luckless
peter
than
even
i
suffered
such
cruel
indignities
at
monkish
hands
and
that
haughty
naughty
queen
in
her
tower
of
nesle
qui
commanda
que
buridan
fut
jecté
en
ung
sac
en
seine
yes
we
have
seen
them
with
the
eye
and
heard
them
speak
and
sing
and
scold
and
jest
and
laugh
and
weep
and
even
pray
and
i
have
sketched
them
as
you
shall
see
some
day
good
reader
and
let
me
tell
you
that
their
beauty
was
by
no
means
maddening
the
standard
of
female
loveliness
has
gone
up
even
in
france
even
très
sage
was
scarcely
worth
such
a
sacrifice
as
but
there
possess
your
soul
in
patience
all
that
and
it
is
all
but
endless
will
appear
in
due
time
with
such
descriptions
and
illustrations
as
i
flatter
myself
the
world
has
never
bargained
for
and
will
value
as
it
has
never
valued
any
historical
records
yet
day
after
day
for
more
than
twenty
years
mary
has
kept
a
voluminous
diary
in
a
cipher
known
to
us
both
it
is
now
my
property
and
in
it
every
detail
of
our
long
journey
into
the
past
has
been
set
down
contemporaneously
day
by
day
during
the
leisure
accorded
to
me
by
the
kindness
of
governor
i
have
drawn
over
again
from
memory
the
sketches
of
people
and
places
i
was
able
to
make
straight
from
nature
during
those
wonderful
nights
at
magna
sed
apta
i
can
guarantee
the
correctness
of
them
and
the
fidelity
of
their
likenesses
no
doubt
their
execution
leaves
much
to
be
desired
both
her
task
and
mine
to
the
future
publication
of
which
this
autobiography
is
but
an
introduction
have
been
performed
with
the
minutest
care
and
conscientiousness
no
time
or
trouble
have
been
spared
for
instance
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
alone
which
we
were
able
to
study
from
seventeen
different
points
of
view
cost
us
no
less
than
two
months
unremitting
labor
as
we
reached
further
and
further
back
through
the
stream
of
time
the
task
became
easier
in
a
way
but
we
have
had
to
generalize
more
and
often
for
want
of
time
and
space
to
use
types
in
lieu
of
individuals
for
with
every
successive
generation
the
number
of
our
progenitors
increased
in
geometrical
progression
as
in
the
problem
of
the
nails
in
the
horseshoe
until
a
limit
of
numbers
was
reached
namely
the
sum
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
terrestrial
globe
in
the
seventh
century
there
was
not
a
person
living
in
france
not
to
mention
europe
who
was
not
in
the
line
of
our
direct
ancestry
excepting
of
course
those
who
had
died
without
issue
and
were
mere
collaterals
illustration
the
mammoth
we
have
even
just
been
able
to
see
as
in
a
glass
darkly
the
faint
shadows
of
the
mammoth
and
the
cave
bear
and
of
the
man
who
hunted
and
killed
and
ate
them
that
he
might
live
and
prevail
the
mammoth
we
have
walked
round
him
and
under
him
as
he
browsed
and
even
him
where
he
lay
and
rested
as
one
walks
through
the
dun
mist
in
a
little
hollow
on
a
still
damp
morning
and
turning
round
to
look
at
the
proper
distance
there
was
the
unmistakable
shape
again
just
thick
enough
to
blot
out
the
lines
of
the
dim
primeval
landscape
beyond
and
make
a
hole
in
the
blank
sky
a
dread
silhouette
thrilling
our
hearts
with
awe
blurred
and
indistinct
like
a
composite
photograph
merely
the
as
it
had
been
seen
generally
by
all
who
had
ever
seen
it
at
all
every
one
of
whom
exceptis
excipiendis
was
necessarily
an
ancestor
of
ours
and
of
every
man
now
living
there
it
stood
or
reclined
the
monster
like
the
phantom
of
an
overgrown
hairy
elephant
we
could
almost
see
or
fancy
we
saw
the
expression
of
his
dull
cold
antediluvian
eye
almost
perceive
a
suggestion
of
in
his
fell
mary
firmly
believed
that
we
should
have
got
in
time
to
our
hairy
ancestor
with
pointed
ears
and
a
tail
and
have
been
able
to
ascertain
whether
he
was
arboreal
in
his
habits
or
not
with
what
passionate
interest
she
would
have
followed
and
studied
and
described
him
and
i
with
what
eager
joy
and
yet
with
what
filial
reverence
i
would
have
sketched
his
likeness
with
what
conscientious
fidelity
as
far
as
my
poor
powers
would
allow
for
all
we
know
to
the
contrary
he
may
have
been
the
most
attractive
and
engaging
little
beast
that
ever
was
and
far
less
humiliating
to
descend
from
than
many
a
titled
yahoo
of
the
present
day
fate
alas
has
willed
that
it
should
be
otherwise
and
on
others
duly
trained
must
devolve
the
delightful
task
of
following
up
the
clew
we
have
been
so
fortunate
as
to
discover
and
now
the
time
has
come
for
me
to
tell
as
quickly
as
i
may
the
story
of
my
bereavement
a
bereavement
so
immense
that
no
man
living
or
dead
can
ever
have
experienced
the
like
and
to
explain
how
it
is
that
i
have
not
only
survived
it
and
kept
my
wits
which
some
people
seem
to
doubt
but
am
here
calmly
and
cheerfully
writing
my
reminiscences
just
as
if
i
were
a
famous
academician
actor
novelist
statesman
or
general
blandly
garrulous
and
with
myself
and
the
world
during
the
latter
years
of
our
joint
existence
mary
and
i
engrossed
by
our
fascinating
journey
through
the
centuries
had
seen
little
or
nothing
of
each
other
outer
lives
or
rather
i
had
seen
nothing
of
hers
for
she
still
came
back
sometimes
with
me
to
my
jail
i
only
saw
her
as
she
chose
to
appear
in
our
dream
perhaps
at
the
bottom
of
this
there
may
have
been
a
feminine
dislike
on
her
part
to
be
seen
growing
older
for
at
magna
sed
apta
we
were
always
or
thereabouts
at
our
very
best
we
had
truly
discovered
the
fountain
of
perennial
youth
and
had
drunk
thereof
and
in
our
dream
we
always
felt
even
younger
than
we
looked
we
had
the
buoyancy
of
children
and
their
freshness
often
had
we
talked
of
death
and
separation
and
the
mystery
beyond
but
only
as
people
do
for
whom
such
contingencies
are
remote
yet
in
reality
time
flew
as
rapidly
for
us
as
for
others
although
we
were
less
sensible
of
its
flight
there
came
a
day
when
mary
exuberant
vitality
so
constantly
overtaxed
broke
down
and
she
was
ill
for
a
while
although
that
did
not
prevent
our
meeting
as
usual
and
there
was
no
perceptible
difference
in
her
when
we
met
but
i
am
certain
that
in
reality
she
was
never
quite
the
same
again
as
she
had
been
and
the
dread
possibility
of
parting
any
day
would
come
up
oftener
in
our
talk
in
our
minds
only
too
often
and
our
minds
were
as
one
she
knew
that
if
i
died
first
everything
i
had
brought
into
magna
sed
apta
and
little
it
was
would
be
there
no
more
even
to
my
body
ever
lying
supine
on
the
couch
by
the
enchanted
window
it
she
had
woke
by
chance
to
our
common
life
before
i
had
or
remained
after
i
had
been
summoned
away
to
my
jail
and
i
knew
that
if
she
died
not
only
her
body
on
the
adjacent
couch
but
all
magna
sed
apta
itself
would
melt
away
and
be
as
if
it
had
never
been
with
its
endless
galleries
and
gardens
and
magic
windows
and
all
the
wonders
it
contained
sometimes
i
felt
a
hideous
nervous
dread
on
sinking
into
sleep
lest
i
should
find
it
was
so
and
the
delight
of
waking
there
and
finding
all
as
usual
was
but
the
keener
i
would
kneel
by
her
inanimate
body
and
gaze
at
her
with
a
passion
of
love
that
seemed
made
up
of
all
the
different
kinds
of
love
a
human
being
can
feel
even
the
love
of
a
dog
for
his
mistress
was
in
it
and
that
of
a
wild
beast
for
its
young
with
eager
tremulous
anxiety
and
aching
suspense
i
would
watch
for
the
first
light
breath
from
her
lips
the
first
faint
tinge
of
carmine
in
her
cheek
that
always
heralded
her
coming
back
to
life
and
when
she
opened
her
eyes
and
smiled
and
stretched
her
long
young
limbs
in
the
joy
of
waking
what
transports
of
gratitude
and
relief
illustration
waiting
ah
me
the
recollection
at
last
a
terrible
unforgettable
night
arrived
when
my
presentiment
was
fulfilled
i
awoke
in
the
little
of
parva
sed
apta
where
the
door
had
always
been
that
led
to
and
from
our
palace
of
delight
but
there
was
no
door
any
longer
nothing
but
a
blank
wall
i
woke
back
at
once
in
my
cell
in
such
a
state
as
it
is
impossible
to
describe
i
felt
there
must
be
some
mistake
and
after
much
time
and
effort
was
able
to
sink
into
sleep
again
but
with
the
same
result
the
blank
wall
the
certainty
that
magna
sed
apta
was
closed
forever
that
mary
was
dead
and
then
the
terrible
jump
back
into
my
prison
life
again
this
happened
several
times
during
the
night
and
when
the
morning
dawned
i
was
a
raving
madman
i
took
the
warder
who
first
came
attracted
by
my
cries
of
mary
for
colonel
ibbetson
and
tried
to
kill
him
and
should
have
done
so
but
that
he
was
a
very
big
man
almost
as
powerful
as
myself
and
only
half
my
age
other
warders
came
to
the
rescue
and
i
took
them
all
for
ibbetsons
and
fought
like
the
maniac
i
was
when
i
came
to
myself
after
long
horrors
and
and
what
not
i
was
removed
from
the
jail
infirmary
to
another
place
where
i
am
now
i
had
suddenly
recovered
my
reason
and
woke
to
mental
agony
such
as
i
who
had
stood
in
the
dock
and
been
condemned
to
a
shameful
death
had
never
even
dreamed
of
i
soon
had
the
knowledge
of
my
loss
confirmed
and
heard
it
had
been
common
talk
for
more
than
nine
days
that
the
famous
mary
duchess
of
towers
had
met
her
death
at
the
station
of
the
metropolitan
railway
a
woman
carrying
a
child
had
been
jostled
by
a
tipsy
man
just
as
a
train
was
entering
the
station
and
dropped
her
child
onto
the
metals
she
tried
to
jump
after
it
but
was
held
back
and
mary
who
had
just
come
up
jumped
in
her
stead
and
by
a
miracle
of
strength
and
agility
was
just
able
to
clutch
the
child
and
get
onto
the
way
as
the
engine
came
by
she
was
able
to
carry
the
child
to
the
end
of
the
train
and
was
helped
onto
the
platform
it
was
her
train
and
she
got
into
a
carriage
but
she
was
dead
before
it
reached
the
next
station
her
heart
which
it
seems
had
been
diseased
for
some
time
had
stopped
and
all
was
over
so
died
mary
seraskier
at
i
lay
for
many
weeks
convalescent
in
body
but
in
a
state
of
dumb
dry
tearless
despair
to
which
there
never
came
a
moment
relief
except
in
the
dreamless
sleep
i
got
from
chloral
which
was
given
to
me
in
large
quantities
and
then
the
i
never
spoke
nor
answered
a
question
and
hardly
ever
stirred
i
had
one
fixed
idea
that
of
and
after
two
unsuccessful
attempts
i
was
so
closely
bound
and
watched
night
and
day
that
any
further
attempt
was
impossible
they
would
not
trust
me
with
a
toothpick
or
a
button
or
a
piece
of
common
packthread
i
tried
to
starve
myself
to
death
and
refused
all
solid
food
but
an
intolerable
thirst
perhaps
artificially
brought
on
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
refuse
any
liquid
that
was
offered
and
i
was
tempted
with
milk
port
and
sherry
and
these
kept
me
alive
i
had
lost
all
wish
to
dream
at
length
one
afternoon
a
strange
inexplicable
overwhelming
nostalgic
desire
came
over
me
to
see
once
more
the
mare
only
once
to
walk
thither
for
the
last
time
through
the
chaussée
de
la
muette
and
by
the
fortifications
it
grew
upon
me
till
it
became
a
torture
to
wait
for
bedtime
so
frantic
was
my
impatience
when
the
hour
arrived
at
last
i
laid
myself
down
once
more
as
nearly
as
i
could
for
my
bonds
in
the
old
position
i
had
not
tried
for
so
long
my
will
intent
upon
the
porte
de
la
muette
an
old
stone
that
separated
the
grande
rue
de
passy
from
the
entrance
to
the
bois
de
boulogne
a
kind
of
temple
bar
it
was
pulled
down
years
ago
i
soon
found
myself
there
just
where
the
grande
rue
meets
the
rue
de
la
pompe
and
went
through
the
arch
and
looked
towards
the
bois
it
was
a
dull
leaden
day
in
autumn
few
people
were
about
but
a
gay
de
was
being
held
at
a
little
restaurant
on
my
side
it
was
to
celebrate
the
wedding
of
achille
grigoux
the
with
félicité
lenormand
who
had
been
the
i
suddenly
remembered
all
this
and
that
mimsey
and
gogo
were
of
the
party
the
latter
indeed
being
garçon
on
whom
would
soon
devolve
the
duty
of
stealing
the
bride
garter
and
cutting
it
up
into
little
bits
to
adorn
the
of
the
male
guests
before
the
ball
began
in
an
archway
on
my
left
some
forlorn
old
rips
and
were
patiently
waiting
ready
saddled
and
bridled
to
be
hired
chloris
murat
rigolette
and
others
i
knew
and
had
ridden
them
all
nearly
half
a
century
ago
poor
old
shadows
of
the
past
so
and
real
and
pathetic
it
split
me
the
heart
to
see
them
a
handsome
young
courier
of
the
name
of
lami
came
trotting
along
from
st
cloud
on
a
roan
horse
with
a
great
jingling
of
his
horse
bells
and
clacking
of
his
whip
he
stopped
at
the
restaurant
and
called
for
a
glass
of
white
wine
and
rising
in
his
stirrups
shouted
gayly
for
monsieur
et
madame
grigoux
they
appeared
at
the
window
looking
very
happy
and
he
drank
their
health
and
they
his
i
could
see
gogo
and
mimsey
in
the
crowd
behind
them
and
mildly
wondered
again
as
i
had
so
often
wondered
before
how
i
came
to
see
it
all
from
the
outside
from
another
point
of
view
than
gogo
then
the
courier
bowed
gallantly
and
said
bonne
chance
and
went
trotting
down
the
grande
rue
on
his
way
to
the
tuileries
and
the
wedding
guests
began
to
sing
they
sang
a
song
beginning
il
était
un
petit
navire
qui
jamais
i
had
quite
forgotten
it
and
listened
till
the
end
and
thought
it
very
pretty
and
was
interested
in
a
dull
mechanical
way
at
discovering
that
it
must
be
the
original
of
thackeray
famous
ballad
of
little
billee
which
i
did
not
hear
till
many
years
after
when
they
came
to
the
last
verse
cette
histoire
vous
embête
nous
allons
la
i
went
on
my
way
this
was
my
last
walk
in
dreamland
perhaps
and
are
uncertain
and
i
would
make
the
most
of
them
and
look
about
me
i
walked
towards
ranelagh
a
kind
of
casino
where
they
used
to
give
balls
and
theatrical
performances
on
sunday
and
thursday
nights
and
where
afterwards
rossini
spent
the
latter
years
of
his
life
then
it
was
pulled
down
i
am
told
to
make
room
for
many
smart
little
villas
in
the
meadow
opposite
erard
park
saindou
were
playing
rounders
balle
au
from
which
i
concluded
it
was
a
thursday
afternoon
a
if
they
had
had
clean
shirts
on
which
they
had
not
it
would
have
been
sunday
and
the
holiday
a
whole
one
i
knew
them
all
and
the
two
or
ushers
lartigue
and
petit
but
no
longer
cared
for
them
or
found
them
amusing
or
interesting
in
the
least
opposite
the
ranelagh
a
few
old
men
were
pacifically
killing
time
by
a
game
of
knocking
sous
off
a
cork
with
other
sous
great
fat
sous
and
double
sous
long
gone
out
of
fashion
it
is
a
very
good
game
and
i
watched
it
for
a
while
and
envied
the
players
close
by
was
a
small
wooden
shed
or
prettily
painted
and
glazed
and
ornamented
at
the
top
with
little
tricolor
flags
it
belonged
to
a
couple
of
old
ladies
mère
manette
and
grandmère
two
oldest
women
ever
seen
they
were
very
keen
about
business
and
would
not
give
credit
for
a
centime
not
even
to
english
boys
they
were
said
to
be
immensely
rich
and
quite
alone
in
the
world
how
very
dead
they
must
be
now
i
thought
and
i
gazed
at
them
and
wondered
at
their
liveliness
and
the
pleasure
they
took
in
living
they
sold
many
things
nougat
mirlitons
hoops
drums
noisy
battledoors
and
shuttlecocks
and
little
neatly
bound
in
zinc
that
could
open
and
shut
i
looked
at
myself
in
one
of
these
that
was
hanging
outside
i
was
old
and
worn
and
face
badly
shaven
my
hair
almost
white
i
had
never
been
old
in
a
dream
before
i
walked
through
the
gate
in
the
fortifications
on
to
the
outer
talus
which
was
quite
bare
in
those
days
in
the
direction
of
the
mare
the
place
seemed
very
deserted
and
dull
for
a
thursday
it
was
a
sad
and
sober
walk
my
melancholy
was
not
to
be
borne
my
heart
was
utterly
broken
and
my
body
so
tired
i
could
scarcely
drag
myself
along
never
before
had
i
known
in
a
dream
what
it
was
to
be
tired
i
gazed
at
the
famous
fortifications
in
all
their
pinkness
the
scaffoldings
barely
removed
some
of
them
still
lying
in
the
dry
ditch
between
and
smiled
to
think
how
these
little
brick
and
granite
walls
would
avail
to
keep
the
germans
out
of
paris
thirty
years
later
twenty
years
ago
i
tried
to
throw
a
stone
across
the
narrow
part
and
found
i
could
no
longer
throw
stones
so
i
sat
down
and
rested
how
thin
my
legs
were
and
how
miserably
clad
in
old
prison
trousers
greasy
stained
and
frayed
and
ignobly
kneed
and
what
boots
illustration
i
sat
down
and
rested
never
had
i
been
shabby
in
a
dream
before
why
could
not
i
once
for
all
walk
round
to
the
other
side
and
take
a
header
la
off
those
lofty
bulwarks
and
kill
myself
for
good
and
all
alas
i
should
only
blur
the
dream
and
perhaps
even
wake
in
my
miserable
and
i
wanted
to
see
the
once
more
very
badly
this
set
me
thinking
i
would
fill
my
pockets
with
stones
and
throw
myself
into
the
mare
after
i
had
taken
a
last
good
look
at
it
and
around
perhaps
the
shock
of
emotion
in
my
present
state
of
weakness
might
really
kill
me
in
my
sleep
who
knows
it
was
worth
trying
anyhow
i
got
up
and
dragged
myself
to
the
it
was
deserted
but
for
one
solitary
female
figure
soberly
clad
in
black
and
gray
that
sat
motionless
on
the
bench
by
the
old
willow
i
walked
slowly
round
in
her
direction
picking
up
stones
and
putting
them
into
my
pockets
and
saw
that
she
was
and
with
very
dark
eyebrows
and
extremely
tall
and
that
her
magnificent
eyes
were
following
me
then
as
i
drew
nearer
she
smiled
and
showed
gleaming
white
teeth
and
her
eyes
crinkled
and
nearly
closed
up
as
she
did
so
oh
my
god
i
shrieked
it
is
mary
seraskier
i
ran
to
her
i
threw
myself
at
her
feet
and
buried
my
face
in
her
lap
and
there
i
sobbed
like
a
hysterical
child
while
she
tried
to
soothe
me
as
one
soothes
a
child
after
a
while
i
looked
up
into
her
face
it
was
old
and
worn
and
gray
and
her
hair
nearly
white
like
mine
i
had
never
seen
her
like
that
before
she
had
always
been
but
age
became
her
well
she
looked
so
benignly
beautiful
and
calm
and
grand
that
i
was
awed
and
quick
chill
waves
went
down
my
backbone
her
dress
and
bonnet
were
old
and
shabby
her
gloves
had
been
mended
old
kid
gloves
with
fur
about
the
wrists
she
drew
them
off
and
took
my
hands
and
made
me
sit
beside
her
and
looked
at
me
for
a
while
with
all
her
might
in
silence
at
length
she
said
gogo
mio
i
know
all
you
have
been
through
by
the
touch
of
your
hands
does
the
touch
of
mine
tell
you
nothing
it
told
me
nothing
but
her
huge
love
for
me
which
was
all
i
cared
for
and
i
said
so
she
sighed
and
said
i
was
afraid
it
would
be
like
this
the
old
circuit
is
broken
and
ca
be
restored
not
yet
we
tried
again
hard
but
it
was
useless
she
looked
round
and
about
and
up
at
the
everywhere
and
then
at
me
again
with
great
wistfulness
and
shivered
and
finally
began
to
speak
with
hesitation
at
first
and
in
a
manner
foreign
to
her
but
soon
she
became
apparently
herself
and
found
her
old
swift
smile
and
laugh
her
happy
slight
shrugs
and
gestures
and
quaint
polyglot
colloquialisms
which
i
omit
as
i
can
not
always
spell
them
her
homely
simple
ways
of
speech
her
fluent
magnetic
energy
the
winning
and
sympathetic
modulations
of
her
voice
its
quick
humorous
changes
from
grave
to
gay
all
that
made
everything
she
said
so
suggestive
of
all
she
wanted
to
say
besides
gogo
i
knew
you
would
come
i
it
how
dreadfully
you
have
suffered
how
thin
you
are
it
shocks
me
to
see
you
but
that
will
not
be
any
more
we
are
going
to
change
all
that
gogo
you
have
no
idea
how
difficult
it
has
been
for
me
to
come
back
even
for
a
few
short
hours
for
i
ca
hold
on
very
long
it
is
like
hanging
on
to
the
by
one
wrists
this
time
it
is
hero
swimming
to
leander
or
juliet
climbing
up
to
romeo
nobody
has
ever
come
back
before
i
am
but
a
poor
husk
of
my
former
self
put
together
at
great
pains
for
you
to
know
me
by
i
could
not
make
myself
again
what
i
have
always
been
to
you
i
had
to
be
content
with
this
and
so
must
you
these
are
the
clothes
i
died
in
but
you
knew
me
directly
dear
gogo
i
have
come
a
long
way
such
a
long
way
to
have
an
with
you
i
had
so
many
things
to
say
and
now
we
are
both
here
hand
in
hand
as
we
used
to
be
i
ca
even
understand
what
they
were
and
if
i
could
i
could
make
understand
but
you
will
know
some
day
and
there
is
no
hurry
whatever
every
thought
you
have
had
since
i
died
i
know
already
share
of
the
circuit
is
unbroken
at
least
i
know
now
why
you
picked
up
those
stones
and
put
them
in
your
pockets
you
must
never
think
of
again
you
never
will
besides
it
would
be
of
no
use
poor
gogo
then
she
looked
up
at
the
sky
and
all
round
her
again
and
smiled
in
her
old
happy
manner
and
rubbed
her
eyes
with
the
backs
of
her
hands
and
seemed
to
settle
herself
for
a
good
long
talk
an
of
all
she
said
i
can
only
give
a
few
fragments
whatever
i
can
recall
and
understand
when
awake
wherever
i
have
forgotten
i
will
put
a
line
of
little
dots
only
when
i
sleep
and
dream
can
i
recall
and
understand
the
rest
it
seems
all
very
simple
then
i
often
say
to
myself
i
will
fix
it
well
in
my
mind
and
put
it
into
words
words
and
learn
them
by
heart
and
then
wake
cautiously
and
remember
them
and
write
them
all
down
in
a
book
so
that
they
shall
do
for
others
all
they
have
done
for
me
and
turn
doubt
into
happy
certainty
and
despair
into
patience
and
hope
and
high
elation
illustration
it
is
mary
seraskier
but
the
bell
rings
and
i
wake
and
my
memory
plays
me
false
nothing
remains
but
the
knowledge
all
will
be
well
for
us
all
and
of
such
a
kind
that
those
who
do
not
sigh
for
the
moon
will
be
well
alas
this
knowledge
i
can
not
impart
it
to
others
like
many
who
have
lived
before
me
i
can
not
prove
i
can
only
affirm
how
odd
and
it
feels
she
began
to
have
eyes
and
ears
again
and
all
that
little
open
windows
on
to
what
is
near
us
they
are
very
clumsy
contrivances
i
had
already
forgotten
them
look
there
goes
our
old
friend
the
under
the
bank
the
old
fat
father
bon
gros
as
we
used
to
call
him
he
is
only
a
little
flat
picture
moving
upsidedown
in
the
opposite
direction
across
the
backs
of
our
eyes
and
the
farther
he
goes
the
smaller
he
seems
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
off
we
should
see
him
at
all
as
it
is
we
can
only
see
the
outside
of
him
and
that
only
on
one
side
at
a
time
and
yet
he
is
full
of
important
and
wonderful
things
that
have
taken
millions
of
years
to
make
like
us
and
to
see
him
at
all
we
have
to
look
straight
at
him
and
then
we
ca
see
what
behind
us
or
around
and
if
it
was
dark
we
could
see
anything
whatever
poor
eyes
little
bags
full
of
water
with
a
little
inside
and
a
nasturtium
leaf
behind
to
catch
the
light
and
feel
it
a
celebrated
german
oculist
once
told
papa
that
if
his
were
to
send
him
such
an
machine
as
a
human
eye
he
would
send
it
back
and
refuse
to
pay
the
bill
i
can
understand
that
now
and
yet
on
earth
where
should
we
be
without
eyes
and
afterwards
where
should
we
be
if
some
of
us
had
once
had
them
on
earth
i
can
hear
your
dear
voice
gogo
with
both
ears
why
two
ears
why
only
two
what
you
want
or
think
or
feel
you
try
to
tell
me
in
sounds
that
you
have
been
taught
english
french
if
i
did
know
english
and
french
it
would
be
no
good
whatever
language
is
a
poor
thing
you
fill
your
lungs
with
wind
and
shake
a
little
slit
in
your
throat
and
make
mouths
and
that
shakes
the
air
and
the
air
shakes
a
pair
of
little
drums
in
my
head
a
very
complicated
arrangement
with
lots
of
bones
behind
and
my
brain
seizes
your
meaning
in
the
rough
what
a
roundabout
way
and
what
a
waste
of
time
and
so
with
all
the
rest
we
ca
even
smell
straight
a
dog
would
laugh
at
us
not
that
even
a
dog
knows
much
and
feeling
we
can
feel
too
hot
or
too
cold
and
it
sometimes
makes
us
ill
or
even
kills
us
but
we
ca
feel
the
coming
storm
or
which
is
north
and
south
or
where
the
new
moon
is
or
the
sun
at
midnight
or
the
stars
at
noon
or
even
what
it
is
by
our
own
measurement
we
can
not
even
find
our
way
home
blindfolded
not
even
a
pigeon
can
do
that
nor
a
swallow
nor
an
owl
only
a
mole
or
a
blind
man
perhaps
feebly
groping
with
a
stick
if
he
has
already
been
that
way
before
and
taste
it
is
well
said
there
is
no
accounting
for
it
and
then
to
keep
all
this
going
we
have
to
eat
and
drink
and
sleep
and
all
the
rest
what
a
burden
and
you
and
i
are
the
only
mortals
that
i
know
of
who
ever
found
a
way
to
each
other
inner
being
by
the
touch
of
the
hands
and
then
we
had
to
go
to
sleep
first
our
bodies
were
miles
apart
not
that
would
have
made
any
difference
for
we
could
never
have
done
it
waking
never
not
if
we
hugged
each
other
to
extinction
gogo
i
can
not
find
any
words
to
tell
you
for
there
are
none
in
any
language
that
ever
knew
to
tell
it
but
where
i
am
it
is
all
ear
and
eye
and
the
rest
in
and
there
is
oh
how
much
more
besides
things
a
has
known
and
an
ant
and
a
mole
and
a
and
an
earthworm
and
a
leaf
and
a
root
and
a
magnet
even
a
lump
of
chalk
and
more
one
can
see
and
smell
and
touch
and
taste
a
sound
as
well
as
hear
it
and
it
is
very
simple
though
it
may
not
seem
so
to
you
now
and
the
sounds
ah
what
sounds
the
thick
atmosphere
of
earth
is
no
conductor
for
such
as
and
earthly
no
receiver
sound
is
everything
sound
and
light
are
one
and
what
does
it
all
mean
i
knew
what
it
meant
when
i
was
there
part
of
it
at
least
and
should
know
again
in
a
few
hours
but
this
poor
old
of
mine
which
i
have
had
to
put
on
once
more
as
an
old
woman
puts
on
a
nightcap
is
like
my
eyes
and
ears
it
can
now
only
understand
what
is
of
the
earth
what
can
understand
gogo
who
are
still
of
the
earth
i
forget
as
one
forgets
an
ordinary
dream
as
one
sometimes
forgets
the
answer
to
a
riddle
or
the
last
verse
of
a
song
it
is
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
but
there
it
sticks
and
wo
come
any
farther
remember
it
is
only
in
your
brain
i
am
living
now
your
earthly
brain
that
has
been
my
only
home
for
so
many
happy
years
as
mine
has
been
yours
how
we
have
nestled
but
this
i
know
one
must
have
had
them
all
once
brains
ears
eyes
and
the
rest
on
earth
faut
avoir
passé
par
là
or
no
for
man
or
beast
would
be
possible
or
even
conceivable
one
can
not
teach
a
born
how
to
understand
a
musical
score
nor
a
born
blind
man
how
to
feel
color
to
beethoven
who
had
once
heard
with
the
ear
his
deafness
made
no
difference
nor
their
blindness
to
homer
and
milton
can
you
make
out
my
little
parable
sound
and
light
and
heat
and
electricity
and
motion
and
will
and
thought
and
remembrance
and
love
and
hate
and
pity
and
the
desire
to
be
born
and
to
live
and
the
longing
of
all
things
alive
and
dead
to
get
near
each
other
or
to
fly
apart
and
lots
of
other
things
besides
all
that
comes
to
the
same
comme
qui
dirait
bonnet
blanc
et
blanc
bonnet
as
monsieur
le
major
used
to
say
simple
comme
bonjour
where
i
am
gogo
i
can
hear
the
sun
shining
on
the
earth
and
making
the
flowers
blow
and
the
birds
sing
and
the
bells
peal
for
birth
and
marriage
and
death
happy
happy
death
if
you
only
knew
la
clef
des
champs
it
shines
on
moons
and
planets
and
i
can
hear
it
and
hear
the
echo
they
give
back
again
the
very
stars
are
singing
rather
a
long
way
off
but
it
is
well
worth
their
while
with
such
an
audience
as
lies
between
us
and
them
and
they
ca
help
it
i
ca
hear
it
here
not
a
bit
now
that
i
got
my
ears
on
besides
the
winds
of
the
earth
are
too
loud
ah
that
music
if
you
like
but
men
and
women
are
to
it
their
ears
are
in
the
way
those
poor
unseen
flat
fish
that
live
in
the
darkness
and
mud
at
the
bottom
of
deep
seas
ca
catch
the
music
men
and
women
make
upon
the
earth
such
poor
music
as
it
is
but
if
ever
so
faint
a
murmur
borne
on
the
wings
and
fins
of
a
sunbeam
reaches
them
for
a
few
minutes
at
and
they
have
a
speck
of
marrow
in
their
spines
to
feel
it
and
no
ears
or
eyes
to
come
between
they
are
better
off
than
any
man
gogo
their
dull
existence
is
more
blessed
than
his
but
alas
for
them
as
yet
they
have
got
the
memory
of
the
eye
and
ear
and
without
that
no
speck
of
spinal
marrow
will
avail
they
must
be
content
to
wait
like
you
the
blind
and
deaf
oh
yes
it
is
all
right
for
the
poor
and
born
blind
of
the
earth
they
can
remember
with
the
past
eyes
and
ears
of
all
the
rest
besides
it
is
no
longer
there
is
no
that
is
only
a
detail
you
must
try
and
realize
that
it
is
just
as
though
all
space
between
us
and
the
sun
and
stars
were
full
of
little
specks
of
spinal
marrow
much
too
small
to
be
seen
in
any
microscope
smaller
than
anything
in
the
world
all
space
is
full
of
them
shoulder
to
shoulder
almost
as
close
as
sardines
in
a
box
and
there
is
still
room
for
more
yet
a
single
drop
of
water
would
hold
them
all
and
not
be
the
less
transparent
they
all
remember
having
been
alive
on
earth
or
elsewhere
in
some
form
or
other
and
each
knows
all
the
others
remember
i
can
only
compare
it
to
that
once
all
that
space
was
only
full
of
stones
rushing
whirling
meeting
and
crushing
together
and
melting
and
steaming
in
the
of
their
own
hurry
but
now
there
a
crop
of
something
better
than
stones
i
can
promise
you
it
goes
on
gathering
and
being
garnered
and
mingled
and
sifted
and
winnowed
the
precious
indestructible
harvest
of
how
many
millions
of
years
of
life
and
this
i
know
the
longer
and
more
strenuously
and
completely
one
lives
one
life
on
earth
the
better
for
all
it
is
the
foundation
of
everything
though
if
men
could
guess
what
is
in
store
for
them
when
they
die
without
also
knowing
they
would
not
have
the
patience
to
live
they
would
wait
for
who
would
fardels
bear
they
would
just
put
stones
in
their
pockets
as
you
did
and
make
for
the
nearest
pond
they
must
nothing
is
lost
nothing
from
the
ineffable
high
fleeting
thought
a
shakespeare
ca
find
words
to
express
to
the
slightest
sensation
of
an
earthworm
nothing
not
a
leaf
feeling
of
the
light
not
a
loadstone
sense
of
the
pole
not
a
single
volcanic
or
electric
thrill
of
the
mother
earth
all
knowledge
must
begin
on
earth
for
it
is
the
most
favored
planet
in
this
poor
system
of
ours
just
now
and
for
a
few
short
millions
of
years
to
come
there
are
just
a
couple
of
others
perhaps
three
but
they
are
not
of
great
consequence
y
fait
trop
chaud
ou
pas
assez
they
are
failures
the
sun
the
father
sun
bon
gros
rains
life
on
to
the
mother
earth
a
poor
little
life
it
was
at
first
as
you
know
grasses
and
moss
and
little
wriggling
transparent
things
all
stomach
it
is
quite
true
that
is
what
we
come
from
shakespeare
and
you
and
i
after
each
individual
death
the
earth
retains
each
individual
clay
to
be
used
again
and
again
and
as
far
as
i
can
see
it
rains
back
each
individual
essence
to
the
sun
or
somewhere
near
it
like
a
precious
returned
to
the
sea
where
it
mingles
after
having
been
about
and
seen
something
of
the
world
and
learned
the
use
of
five
small
wits
and
remembering
all
yes
like
that
poor
little
exiled
wandering
in
the
pretty
song
your
father
used
to
sing
and
which
always
manages
to
find
its
home
at
last
passaggier
in
fiume
va
prigionier
in
fonte
ma
sempre
ritorn
al
mar
or
else
it
is
as
if
little
grains
of
salt
were
being
showered
into
the
mare
to
melt
and
mingle
with
the
water
and
each
other
till
the
mare
itself
was
as
salt
as
salt
can
be
not
till
that
mare
of
the
sun
is
saturated
with
the
salt
of
the
earth
of
earthly
life
and
knowledge
will
the
purpose
be
complete
and
then
old
mother
earth
may
well
dry
up
into
a
cinder
like
the
moon
its
occupation
will
be
gone
like
hers

sont
faites
and
as
for
the
sun
and
its
surrounding
ocean
of
life
ah
that
is
beyond
but
the
sun
will
dry
up
too
and
its
ocean
of
life
no
doubt
be
drawn
to
other
greater
suns
for
everything
seems
to
go
on
more
or
less
in
the
same
way
only
crescendo
everywhere
and
forever
you
must
understand
that
it
is
not
a
bit
like
an
ocean
nor
a
bit
like
or
grains
of
salt
or
specks
of
spinal
marrow
but
it
is
only
by
such
poor
metaphors
that
i
can
give
you
a
glimpse
of
what
i
mean
since
you
can
no
longer
understand
me
as
you
used
to
do
on
earthly
things
by
the
mere
touch
of
our
hands
gogo
i
am
the
only
little
the
one
grain
of
salt
that
has
not
yet
been
able
to
dissolve
and
melt
away
in
that
universal
sea
i
am
the
exception
it
is
as
though
a
long
invisible
chain
bound
me
still
to
the
earth
and
i
were
hung
at
the
other
end
of
it
in
a
little
transparent
locket
a
kind
of
cage
which
lets
me
see
and
hear
things
all
round
but
keeps
me
from
melting
away
and
soon
i
found
that
this
locket
was
made
of
that
half
of
you
that
is
still
in
me
so
that
i
could
dissolve
because
half
of
me
was
dead
at
all
for
the
chain
linked
me
to
that
half
of
myself
i
had
left
in
you
so
that
half
of
me
actually
was
there
to
be
dissolved
i
am
getting
rather
mixed
but
oh
my
heart
true
love
how
i
hugged
my
chain
with
you
at
the
other
end
of
it
with
such
pain
and
effort
as
you
can
not
conceive
i
have
crept
along
it
back
to
you
like
a
spider
on
an
endless
thread
of
its
own
spinning
such
love
as
mine
is
stronger
then
death
indeed
i
have
come
to
tell
you
that
we
are
inseparable
forever
you
and
i
one
double
speck
of
spinal
marrow
one
little
grain
of
salt
one
drop
there
is
to
be
no
parting
for
i
can
see
that
but
such
extraordinary
luck
seems
reserved
for
you
and
me
alone
up
to
now
and
it
is
all
our
own
doing
but
not
till
you
join
me
shall
you
and
i
be
complete
and
free
to
melt
away
in
that
universal
ocean
and
take
our
part
as
one
in
all
is
to
be
that
moment
you
must
not
hasten
it
by
a
moment
time
is
nothing
even
beginning
to
believe
there
no
such
thing
there
is
so
little
difference
between
a
year
and
a
day
and
as
for
space
dear
me
an
inch
is
as
as
an
ell
things
can
not
be
measured
like
that
a
midge
life
is
as
long
as
a
man
for
it
has
time
to
learn
its
business
and
do
all
the
harm
it
can
and
fight
and
make
love
and
marry
and
reproduce
its
kind
and
grow
disenchanted
and
bored
and
sick
and
content
to
die
all
in
a
summer
afternoon
an
average
man
can
live
to
seventy
years
without
doing
much
more
and
then
there
are
tall
midges
and
clever
and
ones
and
midges
of
great
personal
strength
and
cunning
who
can
fly
a
little
faster
and
a
little
farther
than
the
rest
and
live
an
hour
longer
to
drink
a
whole
drop
more
of
some
other
creature
blood
but
it
does
not
make
a
very
great
difference
no
time
and
space
mean
just
the
same
as
but
for
you
they
mean
much
as
you
have
much
to
do
our
joint
life
must
be
revealed
that
long
sweet
life
of
that
has
been
so
much
more
real
than
reality
ah
where
and
what
were
time
or
space
to
us
then
and
you
must
tell
all
we
have
found
out
and
how
the
way
must
be
shown
to
others
with
better
brains
and
better
training
than
had
the
value
to
mankind
to
mankind
here
and
hereafter
may
be
incalculable
for
some
day
when
all
is
found
out
that
can
be
found
out
on
earth
and
made
the
common
property
of
all
or
even
before
that
the
great
man
will
perhaps
arise
and
make
the
great
guess
that
is
to
set
us
all
free
here
and
hereafter
who
knows
i
feel
this
splendid
guesser
will
be
some
inspired
musician
of
the
future
as
simple
as
a
little
child
in
all
things
but
his
knowledge
of
the
power
of
sound
but
even
little
children
will
have
learned
much
in
those
days
he
will
want
new
notes
and
find
them
new
notes
between
the
black
and
white
keys
he
will
go
blind
like
milton
and
homer
and
deaf
like
beethoven
and
then
all
in
the
stillness
and
the
dark
all
in
the
depths
of
his
forlorn
and
lonely
soul
he
will
make
his
best
music
and
out
of
the
endless
mazes
of
its
counterpoint
he
will
evolve
a
secret
as
we
did
from
the
chant
du
triste
commensal
but
it
will
be
a
greater
secret
than
ours
others
will
have
been
very
near
this
hidden
treasure
but
he
will
happen
right
it
and
unearth
it
and
bring
it
to
light
i
think
i
see
him
sitting
at
the
so
familiar
of
old
to
the
feel
of
his
consummate
fingers
painfully
dictating
his
score
to
some
most
patient
and
devoted
friend
mother
sister
daughter
wife
that
score
that
he
will
never
see
or
hear
what
a
stammerer
not
only
blind
and
deaf
but
mad
in
the
world
eyes
for
fifty
a
hundred
a
thousand
years
time
is
nothing
but
that
score
will
survive
he
will
die
of
it
of
course
and
when
he
dies
and
comes
to
us
there
will
be
joy
from
here
to
sirius
and
beyond
and
one
day
they
will
find
out
on
earth
that
he
was
only
deaf
and
blind
not
mad
at
all
they
will
hear
and
they
will
know
that
he
saw
and
heard
as
none
had
ever
heard
or
seen
before
for
we
sow
we
reap
that
is
a
true
saying
and
all
the
sowing
is
done
here
on
earth
and
the
reaping
beyond
man
is
a
grub
his
dead
clay
as
he
lies
coffined
in
his
grave
is
the
cocoon
he
has
spun
for
himself
during
his
earthly
life
to
burst
open
and
soar
from
with
all
his
memories
about
him
even
his
lost
ones
like
the
the
butterfly
the
moth
and
when
die
it
is
the
same
and
the
same
with
a
blade
of
grass
we
are
all
tant
que
nous
little
bags
of
remembrance
that
never
dies
that
what
we
but
we
can
only
bring
with
us
to
the
common
stock
what
we
got
as
père
françois
used
to
say
plus
belle
fille
au
monde
ne
peut
donner
que
ce
a
besides
all
this
i
am
your
earthly
wife
gogo
your
loving
faithful
devoted
wife
and
i
wish
it
to
be
known
and
then
at
last
in
the
fulness
of
time
a
very
few
years
ah
then
once
more
shall
neuha
lead
her
torquil
by
the
hand
oh
mary
i
cried
shall
we
be
transcendently
happy
again
as
happy
as
we
were
even
ah
gogo
is
a
man
happier
than
a
mouse
or
a
mouse
than
a
turnip
or
a
turnip
than
a
lump
of
chalk
but
what
man
would
be
a
mouse
or
a
turnip
or
what
turnip
would
be
a
lump
of
anything
but
itself
are
two
people
happier
than
one
you
and
i
yes
because
we
one
but
who
else
it
is
one
and
all
happiness
is
like
time
and
space
we
make
and
measure
it
ourselves
it
is
a
fancy
as
big
as
little
as
you
please
just
a
thing
of
contrasts
and
comparisons
like
health
or
strength
or
beauty
or
any
other
good
that
would
even
be
noticed
but
for
sad
personal
experience
of
its
opposite
or
its
greater
i
have
forgotten
all
i
know
but
this
which
is
for
you
and
me
we
are
inseparable
forever
be
sure
we
shall
not
want
to
go
back
again
for
a
moment
and
is
there
no
punishment
or
reward
oh
there
again
what
a
detail
poor
little
naughty
perverse
midges
who
were
so
and
keep
straight
poor
little
exemplary
midges
who
could
go
wrong
if
they
tried
is
it
worth
while
is
it
enough
for
either
punishment
or
reward
that
the
secrets
of
all
midges
hearts
shall
be
revealed
and
for
all
other
midges
to
see
think
of
it
there
are
battles
to
be
fought
and
races
to
be
won
but
no
longer
against
and
strength
and
swiftness
to
win
them
but
no
longer
any
strong
and
swift
there
is
weakness
and
cowardice
but
no
longer
any
cowards
or
weaklings
the
good
and
the
bad
and
the
worst
and
the
best
it
is
all
mixed
up
but
the
good
comes
to
the
top
the
bad
goes
to
the
bottom
it
is
precipitated
as
papa
used
to
say
it
is
not
an
agreeable
sediment
with
its
once
useful
cruelty
at
the
lowest
bottom
of
all
out
of
sight
out
of
mind
all
but
forgotten
déjà
le
and
the
goal
the
cause
the
whither
and
the
why
of
it
all
ah
gogo
as
inscrutable
as
unthinkable
as
ever
till
the
great
guesser
comes
at
least
so
it
seems
to
me
speaking
as
a
fool
out
of
the
depths
of
my
poor
ignorance
for
i
am
a
new
arrival
and
a
complete
outsider
with
my
chain
and
locket
waiting
for
you
i
have
only
picked
up
a
few
grains
of
sand
on
the
shore
of
that
sea
a
few
little
shells
and
i
ca
even
show
you
what
they
are
like
i
see
that
it
is
no
good
even
talking
of
it
alas
and
i
had
promised
myself
much
oh
how
my
earthly
education
was
neglected
and
yours
and
how
i
feel
it
now
with
so
much
to
say
in
words
mere
words
why
to
tell
you
in
words
the
little
i
can
see
the
very
little
so
that
you
could
understand
would
require
that
each
of
us
should
be
the
greatest
poet
and
the
greatest
mathematician
that
ever
were
rolled
into
one
how
i
pity
you
gogo
with
your
untrained
unskilled
innocent
pen
poor
scribe
having
to
write
all
this
down
for
you
and
do
your
poor
little
best
as
i
have
done
mine
in
telling
you
you
must
let
the
heart
speak
and
not
mind
style
or
manner
write
how
write
for
the
greatest
need
and
the
greatest
number
but
do
just
try
and
see
this
dearest
and
make
the
best
of
it
you
can
as
far
as
can
make
it
out
everything
everywhere
seems
to
be
an
stream
that
makes
with
inconceivable
velocity
for
its
own
proper
level
where
perfection
is
and
ever
gets
nearer
and
nearer
and
never
finds
it
and
fortunately
never
will
only
that
unlike
an
earthly
stream
and
more
like
a
fresh
flowing
tide
up
an
endless
boundless
shoreless
creek
if
you
can
imagine
that
the
level
it
seeks
is
immeasurably
higher
than
its
source
and
everywhere
in
it
is
life
life
life
ever
renewing
and
doubling
itself
and
ever
swelling
that
mighty
river
which
has
no
banks
and
everywhere
in
it
like
begets
like
a
little
better
or
a
little
worse
and
the
little
worse
finds
its
way
into
some
backwater
and
sticks
there
and
finally
goes
to
the
bottom
and
nobody
cares
and
the
little
better
goes
on
bettering
and
bettering
not
all
man
folly
or
perverseness
can
hinder
nor
make
that
headlong
torrent
stay
or
ebb
or
roll
backward
for
a
moment
plus
fort
que
the
record
goes
on
beating
itself
the
gets
higher
and
higher
till
the
highest
on
earth
is
reached
that
can
be
and
then
i
suppose
the
earth
grows
cold
and
the
sun
goes
out
to
be
broken
up
into
bits
and
used
all
over
again
perhaps
and
betterness
flies
to
warmer
climes
and
higher
systems
to
better
itself
still
and
so
on
from
better
to
better
from
higher
to
higher
from
warmer
to
warmer
and
bigger
to
bigger
for
ever
and
ever
and
ever
but
the
final
superlative
of
all
absolute
all
goodness
and
absolute
absolute
omnipotence
beyond
which
there
neither
is
nor
can
be
anything
more
will
never
be
reached
at
all
since
there
are
no
such
things
they
are
abstractions
besides
which
attainment
means
rest
and
rest
stagnation
and
stagnation
an
end
of
all
and
there
is
no
end
and
never
can
be
no
end
to
time
and
all
the
things
that
are
done
in
it
no
end
to
space
and
all
the
things
that
fill
it
or
all
would
come
together
in
a
heap
and
smash
up
in
the
middle
and
there
no
middle
no
end
no
beginning
no
middle
gogo
think
of
it
is
the
most
inconceivable
thing
of
all
so
who
shall
say
where
shakespeare
and
you
and
i
come
in
tiny
links
in
an
endless
chain
so
tiny
that
even
shakespeare
is
no
bigger
than
we
and
just
a
little
way
behind
us
those
little
wriggling
transparent
things
all
stomach
that
we
descend
from
and
far
ahead
of
ourselves
but
in
the
direct
line
of
a
long
descent
from
an
conscious
power
so
strong
so
glad
so
simple
so
wise
so
mild
and
so
beneficent
that
what
can
we
do
even
now
but
fall
on
our
knees
with
our
foreheads
in
the
dust
and
our
hearts
brimful
of
wonder
hope
and
love
and
tender
shivering
awe
and
worship
as
a
yet
unborn
barely
conceived
and
scarce
begotten
that
which
we
have
always
been
taught
to
worship
as
a
that
which
is
not
now
but
to
be
that
which
we
shall
all
share
in
and
be
part
and
parcel
of
in
the
dim
future
that
which
is
slowly
surely
painfully
weaving
itself
out
of
us
and
the
likes
of
us
all
through
the
limitless
universe
and
whose
coming
we
can
but
faintly
foretell
by
the
casting
of
its
shadow
on
our
own
slowly
surely
painfully
awakening
souls
then
she
went
on
to
speak
of
earthly
things
and
ask
questions
in
her
old
practical
way
first
of
my
bodily
health
with
the
tenderest
solicitude
and
the
wisest
advice
as
a
mother
to
a
son
she
even
insisted
on
listening
to
my
heart
like
a
doctor
then
she
spoke
at
great
length
of
the
charities
in
which
she
had
been
interested
and
gave
me
many
directions
which
i
was
to
write
as
coming
from
myself
to
certain
people
whose
names
and
addresses
she
impressed
upon
me
with
great
care
i
have
done
as
she
wished
and
most
of
these
directions
have
been
followed
to
the
letter
with
no
little
wonder
on
the
world
part
as
the
world
well
knows
that
such
sagacious
and
useful
reforms
should
have
originated
with
the
inmate
of
a
criminal
lunatic
asylum
at
last
the
time
came
for
us
to
part
she
foresaw
that
i
should
have
to
wake
in
a
few
minutes
and
said
rising
and
now
gogo
the
best
beloved
that
ever
was
on
earth
take
me
once
more
in
your
dear
arms
and
kiss
me
for
a
little
while
come
here
to
rest
and
think
and
remember
when
your
body
sleeps
my
spirit
will
always
be
here
with
you
i
may
even
be
able
to
come
back
again
myself
just
this
poor
husk
of
me
hardly
more
to
look
at
than
a
bundle
of
old
clothes
but
yet
a
world
made
up
of
love
for
dearest
and
best
time
is
nothing
but
i
shall
count
the
hours
even
as
she
strained
me
to
her
breast
i
awoke
illustration
i
awoke
and
knew
that
the
dread
black
shadow
of
melancholia
had
passed
away
from
me
like
a
hideous
nightmare
like
a
long
and
horrible
winter
my
heart
was
full
of
the
sunshine
of
spring
the
gladness
of
awaking
to
a
new
life
i
smiled
at
my
night
attendant
who
stared
back
at
me
in
astonishment
and
exclaimed
why
sir
blest
if
you
ai
a
new
man
altogether
there
now
i
wrung
his
hand
and
thanked
him
for
all
his
past
patience
kindness
and
forbearance
with
such
effusion
that
his
eyes
had
tears
in
them
i
had
not
spoken
for
weeks
and
he
heard
my
voice
for
the
first
time
that
day
also
without
any
preamble
or
explanation
i
gave
the
doctor
and
the
chaplain
and
the
governor
my
word
of
honor
that
i
would
not
attempt
my
life
again
or
any
one
else
and
was
believed
and
trusted
on
the
spot
and
they
unstrapped
me
i
was
never
so
touched
in
my
life
in
a
week
i
recovered
much
of
my
strength
but
i
was
an
old
man
that
was
a
great
change
most
people
age
gradually
and
imperceptibly
to
me
old
age
had
come
of
a
sudden
in
a
night
as
it
were
but
with
it
and
suddenly
also
the
resigned
and
cheerful
acquiescence
the
mild
serenity
that
are
its
compensation
and
more
my
hope
my
certainty
to
be
one
with
mary
some
day
that
is
my
haven
my
heaven
a
consummation
of
completeness
beyond
which
there
is
nothing
to
wish
for
or
imagine
come
what
else
may
that
is
safe
and
that
is
all
i
care
for
she
was
able
to
care
for
me
and
for
many
other
things
besides
and
i
love
her
all
the
more
for
it
but
i
can
only
care
for
sooner
or
later
a
year
ten
years
it
does
not
matter
much
i
also
am
beginning
to
disbelieve
in
the
existence
of
time
that
waking
was
the
gladdest
in
my
life
gladder
even
than
the
waking
in
my
condemned
cell
the
morning
after
my
sentence
of
death
when
another
black
shadow
passed
away
that
of
the
scaffold
oh
mary
what
has
she
not
done
for
me
what
clouds
has
she
not
dispelled
when
night
came
round
again
i
made
once
more
step
by
step
the
journey
from
the
porte
de
la
muette
to
the
mare
with
everything
the
same
the
gay
the
blue
and
silver
courier
the
merry
guests
singing
il
était
un
petit
navire
nothing
was
altered
even
to
the
dull
gray
weather
but
oh
the
difference
to
me
i
longed
to
play
at
with
the
hackney
coachmen
or
at
balle
au
with
my
old
schoolfellows
i
could
have
even
waltzed
with
monsieur
lartigue
and
le
petit
cazal
i
looked
in
mère
manette
little
mirror
and
saw
my
worn
gray
haggard
old
face
again
and
liked
it
and
thought
it
quite
i
sat
down
and
rested
by
the
fortifications
as
i
had
done
the
night
before
for
i
was
still
tired
but
with
a
most
delicious
fatigue
my
very
shabbiness
was
agreeable
to
me
mais
a
convict
a
madman
but
a
prince
among
men
still
the
beloved
of
mary
and
when
at
last
i
reached
the
spot
i
had
always
loved
the
best
on
earth
ever
since
i
first
saw
it
as
a
child
i
fell
on
my
knees
and
wept
for
sheer
excess
of
joy
it
was
mine
indeed
it
belonged
to
me
as
no
land
or
water
had
ever
belonged
to
any
man
before
mary
was
not
there
of
course
i
did
not
expect
her
but
strange
and
incomprehensible
as
it
seems
she
had
forgotten
her
gloves
she
had
left
them
behind
her
one
was
on
the
bench
one
was
on
the
ground
poor
old
gloves
that
had
been
mended
with
the
shape
of
her
dear
hand
in
them
every
fold
and
crease
preserved
as
in
a
mould
the
very
cast
of
her
and
the
scent
of
she
and
her
mother
had
so
loved
i
laid
them
side
by
side
palms
upward
on
the
bench
where
we
had
sat
the
night
before
no
has
blown
them
away
no
has
stolen
them
there
they
lie
still
and
will
lie
till
the
great
change
comes
over
me
and
i
am
one
with
their
owner
i
am
there
every
night
in
the
lovely
spring
or
autumn
sunshine
meditating
remembering
taking
notes
to
be
learned
by
heard
and
used
next
day
for
a
real
purpose
i
walk
round
and
round
or
sit
on
the
benches
or
lie
in
the
grass
by
the
brink
and
smoke
cigarettes
without
end
and
watch
the
old
amphibious
life
i
found
so
charming
half
a
century
ago
and
find
it
charming
still
sometimes
i
dive
into
the
forest
which
has
now
been
razed
to
the
ground
ever
since
there
is
an
open
space
all
round
the
mare
i
had
seen
it
since
then
in
a
dream
with
mary
who
went
to
paris
after
the
war
and
mad
pilgrimages
by
day
to
all
the
places
so
dear
to
our
hearts
and
so
changed
and
again
when
the
night
came
with
me
for
a
it
was
a
sad
disenchantment
for
us
both
mare
where
i
spend
so
many
hours
is
the
mare
of
louis
philippe
unchangeable
except
for
such
slight
changes
as
occur
now
and
then
between
the
years
and
a
broken
bench
mended
a
new
barrier
put
up
by
the
a
small
wooden
dike
where
the
brink
is
giving
way
illustration
i
am
there
every
night
and
the
thicket
beside
and
behind
it
is
dark
and
dense
for
miles
with
many
tall
trees
and
a
rich
tangled
undergrowth
there
is
a
giant
oak
which
it
is
difficult
to
find
in
that
labyrinth
it
now
stands
for
the
world
alone
in
the
open
an
ornament
to
the
auteuil
i
have
often
climbed
it
as
a
boy
with
mimsey
and
the
rest
i
can
not
climb
it
now
but
i
love
to
lie
on
the
grass
in
its
shade
and
dream
in
my
dream
there
shut
in
on
all
sides
by
fragrant
impenetrable
verdure
with
birds
and
bees
and
butterflies
and
and
strange
beetles
and
little
with
bright
eyes
and
lithe
spotted
snakes
and
lively
brown
squirrels
and
beautiful
green
lizards
for
my
company
now
and
then
a
gentle
roebuck
comes
and
feeds
close
by
me
without
fear
and
the
mole
throws
up
his
little
mound
of
earth
and
takes
an
airing
it
is
a
very
charming
solitude
it
amuses
me
to
think
by
day
when
broad
awake
in
my
sad
english
prison
and
among
my
crazy
peers
how
this
nightly
umbrageous
french
solitude
of
mine
so
many
miles
and
years
away
is
now
but
a
common
bare
wide
grassy
plain
overlooked
by
a
gaudy
beflagged
it
is
sunday
let
us
say
and
for
all
i
know
a
great
race
may
be
going
on
all
paris
is
there
rich
and
poor
little
soldiers
big
gendarmes
keep
the
course
clear
the
sun
shines
the
tricolour
waves
the
gay
familiar
language
makes
the
summer
breeze
musical
i
dare
say
it
is
all
very
bright
and
animated
but
the
whole
place
rings
with
the
vulgar
din
of
the
bookmakers
and
the
air
is
full
of
dust
and
foul
with
the
scent
of
rank
tobacco
the
reek
of
struggling
french
humanity
and
the
gaunt
eiffel
tower
looks
down
upon
it
all
from
the
sky
over
paris
so
at
least
i
am
told
like
a
skeleton
at
a
feast
then
twilight
comes
and
the
crowds
have
departed
on
foot
on
horseback
on
bicycles
and
tricycles
in
every
kind
of
vehicle
many
by
the
de
fer
de
the
auteuil
station
of
which
is
close
by
all
is
quiet
and
bare
and
dull
then
down
drops
the
silent
night
like
a
curtain
and
beneath
its
friendly
cover
the
strange
transformation
effects
itself
quickly
and
all
is
made
ready
for
the
evaporates
the
railway
station
melts
away
into
thin
air
there
is
no
more
eiffel
tower
with
its
electric
light
the
sweet
forest
of
fifty
years
ago
rises
suddenly
out
of
the
ground
and
all
the
wild
live
things
that
once
lived
in
it
wake
to
their
merry
life
again
a
quiet
deep
old
pond
in
a
past
french
forest
hallowed
by
such
memories
what
be
more
enchanting
oh
soft
and
sweet
nostalgia
so
soon
to
be
relieved
up
springs
the
mellow
sun
the
light
of
other
days
to
its
appointed
place
in
the
heavens
zenith
or
east
or
west
according
to
order
a
light
wind
blows
from
the
south
everything
is
properly
disinfected
and
made
warm
and
bright
and
comfortable
and
lo
old
peter
ibbetson
appears
upon
the
scene
absolute
monarch
of
all
he
surveys
for
the
next
eight
hours
one
whose
right
there
are
literally
none
to
dispute
i
do
not
encourage
noisy
gatherings
there
as
a
rule
nor
by
the
pond
i
like
to
keep
the
sweet
place
pretty
much
to
myself
there
is
no
selfishness
in
this
for
i
am
really
depriving
nobody
whoever
comes
there
now
comes
there
nearly
fifty
years
ago
and
does
not
know
it
they
must
have
all
died
long
since
sometimes
it
is
a
in
louis
philippe
blue
and
silver
with
his
black
pipe
his
gaiters
his
old
flint
gun
and
his
embroidered
he
does
well
in
the
landscape
sometimes
it
is
a
pair
of
lovers
if
they
are
and
or
else
the
boys
from
saindou
school
to
play
fly
the
garter
sometimes
it
is
monsieur
le
curé
peacefully
conning
his
hours
as
with
slow
and
thoughtful
step
he
paces
round
and
round
i
can
now
read
his
calm
benevolent
face
by
the
light
of
half
a
century
experience
of
life
and
have
learned
to
love
that
still
black
meditative
aspect
which
i
found
so
antipathetic
as
a
small
boy
is
no
burner
alive
of
little
heretics
this
world
is
big
enough
for
us
both
and
so
is
the
world
to
come
and
he
knows
it
now
at
all
events
illustration
this
world
is
big
enough
for
us
both
sometimes
even
a
couple
of
prendergasts
are
admitted
or
even
three
they
are
not
so
bad
after
all
they
have
the
qualities
of
their
faults
although
you
might
not
think
it
but
very
often
the
old
beloved
shades
arrive
with
their
and
their
high
spirits
and
their
ringing
charlie
and
alfred
and
madge
and
the
rest
and
the
grinning
barking
gyrating
médor
who
dives
after
stones
oh
how
it
does
my
heart
good
to
see
and
hear
them
they
make
me
feel
like
a
grandfather
even
monsieur
le
major
is
younger
than
i
his
mustache
less
white
than
mine
he
only
comes
to
my
chin
but
i
look
up
to
him
still
and
love
and
revere
him
as
when
i
was
a
little
child
and
seraskier
i
place
myself
between
him
and
what
he
is
looking
at
so
that
he
seems
to
be
looking
straight
at
me
but
with
a
look
in
his
eyes
as
is
only
natural
presently
something
amuses
him
and
he
smiles
and
his
eyes
crinkle
up
as
his
daughter
used
to
do
when
she
was
a
woman
and
his
majestic
face
becomes
as
that
of
an
angel
like
hers
du
sourire
and
my
gay
young
father
with
his
vivacity
and
rollicking
laugh
and
eternal
he
is
just
like
a
boy
to
me
now
le
beau
pasquier
he
has
got
a
new
sling
of
his
own
invention
he
pulls
it
out
of
his
pocket
and
slings
stones
high
over
the
and
far
away
out
of
sight
to
the
joy
of
himself
and
everybody
else
and
does
not
trouble
much
as
to
where
they
will
fall
my
mother
is
young
enough
now
to
be
my
daughter
it
is
as
a
daughter
a
sweet
kind
lovely
daughter
that
i
love
her
now
a
daughter
with
a
tall
handsome
husband
who
yodles
divinely
and
slings
stones
and
who
has
presented
me
with
a
grandson
comme
le
for
whatever
peter
ibbetson
may
have
been
in
his
time
there
is
no
gainsaying
the
singular
comeliness
of
little
gogo
pasquier
and
mimsey
is
just
a
child
angel
monsieur
le
major
is
infallible
elle
a
toutes
les
intelligences
de
la
tête
et
du
coeur
vous
verrez
un
jour
quand
ça
ira
mieux
vous
verrez
that
day
has
long
come
and
gone
it
is
easy
to
see
all
that
now
to
have
the
eyes
of
monsieur
le
major
ah
poor
little
mimsey
with
her
cropped
head
and
her
pale
face
and
long
thin
arms
and
legs
and
grave
kind
luminous
eyes
that
have
not
yet
learned
to
smile
what
she
is
to
and
madame
seraskier
in
all
the
youthful
bloom
and
splendor
of
her
sacred
beauty
a
chosen
lily
among
women
the
mother
of
mary
she
sits
on
the
old
bench
by
the
willow
close
to
her
daughter
gloves
sometimes
a
trivial
and
almost
comic
detail
she
actually
seems
to
sit
them
to
my
momentary
distress
but
when
she
goes
away
there
they
are
still
not
flattened
a
bit
the
precious
mould
of
those
beautiful
generous
hands
to
which
i
owe
everything
here
and
hereafter
i
have
not
been
again
to
my
old
home
i
dread
the
sight
of
the
avenue
i
can
not
face
parva
sed
apta
but
i
have
seen
mary
again
seven
times
and
every
time
she
comes
she
brings
a
book
with
her
and
bound
in
green
morocco
like
the
byron
we
read
when
we
were
children
or
in
red
morocco
like
the
out
of
which
we
used
to
translate
gray
elegy
and
the
battle
of
hohenlinden
and
cunningham
pastorals
into
french
such
is
her
fancy
but
inside
these
books
are
very
different
they
are
printed
in
cipher
and
in
a
language
i
can
only
understand
in
my
dream
nothing
that
i
or
any
one
else
has
ever
read
in
any
living
book
can
approach
for
interest
and
importance
what
i
read
in
these
there
are
seven
of
them
i
say
to
myself
when
i
read
them
it
is
perhaps
well
that
i
shall
not
remember
this
when
i
wake
after
all
for
i
might
be
indiscreet
and
injudicious
and
either
say
too
much
or
not
enough
and
the
world
might
come
to
a
all
through
me
for
who
would
fardels
bear
as
mary
said
no
the
world
must
be
content
to
wait
for
the
great
guesser
thus
my
lips
are
sealed
all
i
know
is
this
all
will
be
well
for
us
all
and
of
such
a
kind
that
all
who
do
not
sigh
for
the
moon
will
be
well
in
such
wise
have
i
striven
with
the
best
of
my
ability
to
give
some
account
of
my
two
lives
and
mary
we
have
lived
three
lives
between
us
three
lives
in
one
it
has
been
a
happy
task
however
poorly
performed
and
all
the
conditions
of
its
performance
have
been
singularly
happy
also
a
cell
in
a
criminal
lunatic
asylum
that
does
not
sound
like
a
bower
in
the
elysian
fields
it
is
and
has
been
for
me
besides
the
sun
that
lights
and
warms
my
inner
life
i
have
been
treated
with
a
kindness
and
sympathy
and
consideration
by
everybody
here
from
the
governor
downward
that
fills
me
with
unspeakable
gratitude
most
especially
do
i
feel
grateful
to
my
good
friends
the
doctor
the
chaplain
and
the
priest
best
and
kindest
of
men
each
of
whom
has
made
up
his
mind
about
everything
in
heaven
and
earth
and
below
and
each
in
a
contrary
sense
to
the
two
others
there
is
but
one
thing
they
are
neither
of
them
quite
cocksure
about
and
that
is
whether
i
am
mad
or
sane
and
there
is
one
thing
the
only
one
on
which
they
are
agreed
namely
that
mad
or
sane
i
am
a
great
undiscovered
genius
my
little
sketches
plain
or
colored
fill
them
with
admiration
and
ecstasy
such
boldness
and
facility
and
execution
such
an
overwhelming
fertility
in
the
choice
of
subjects
such
singular
realism
in
the
conception
and
rendering
of
past
scenes
historical
and
otherwise
such
astounding
knowledge
of
architecture
character
costume
and
what
not
such
local
color
it
is
all
as
if
i
had
really
been
there
to
see
i
have
the
greatest
difficulty
in
keeping
my
fame
from
spreading
beyond
the
walls
of
the
asylum
my
modesty
is
as
great
as
my
talent
no
i
do
not
wish
this
great
genius
to
be
discovered
just
yet
it
must
all
go
to
help
and
illustrate
and
adorn
the
work
of
a
much
greater
genius
from
which
it
has
drawn
every
inspiration
it
ever
had
it
is
a
splendid
and
delightful
task
i
have
before
me
to
unravel
and
translate
and
put
in
order
these
voluminous
and
reminiscences
of
mary
all
of
them
written
in
the
cipher
we
invented
together
in
our
dream
a
very
transparent
cipher
when
once
you
have
got
the
key
it
will
take
five
years
at
least
and
i
think
that
without
presumption
i
can
count
on
that
strong
and
active
as
i
feel
and
still
so
far
from
the
age
of
the
psalmist
first
of
all
i
intend
here
ends
my
poor
cousin
memoir
he
was
found
dead
from
effusion
of
blood
on
the
brain
with
his
pen
still
in
his
hand
and
his
head
bowed
down
on
his
unfinished
manuscript
on
the
margin
of
which
he
had
just
sketched
a
small
boy
wheeling
a
toy
wheelbarrow
full
of
stones
from
one
open
door
to
another
one
door
is
labelled
the
other
i
arrived
in
england
after
a
long
life
spent
abroad
at
the
time
his
death
occurred
but
too
late
to
see
him
alive
i
heard
much
about
him
and
his
latter
days
all
those
whose
duties
brought
them
into
contact
with
him
seemed
to
have
regarded
him
with
a
respect
that
bordered
on
veneration
i
had
the
melancholy
satisfaction
of
seeing
him
in
his
coffin
i
had
not
seen
him
since
he
was
twelve
years
old
as
he
lay
there
in
his
still
length
and
breadth
he
appeared
gigantic
the
most
magnificent
human
being
i
ever
beheld
and
the
splendor
of
his
dead
face
will
haunt
my
memory
till
i
die
madge
plunket
