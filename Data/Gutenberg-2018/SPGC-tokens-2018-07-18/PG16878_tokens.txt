for
his
great
wickedness
was
invaded
by
the
army
of
king
of
and
carried
captive
to
the
book
of
the
law
was
lost
till
the
eighteenth
year
of
his
grandson
then
the
high
priest
upon
repairing
the
temple
found
it
there
and
the
king
lamented
that
their
fathers
had
not
done
after
the
words
of
the
book
and
commanded
that
it
should
be
read
to
the
people
and
caused
the
people
to
renew
the
holy
covenant
with
god
this
is
the
book
of
the
law
now
extant
when
came
out
of
and
spoil
the
temple
and
brought
into
subjection
to
the
monarchy
of
which
was
in
the
fifth
year
of
the
continued
under
great
troubles
for
about
twenty
years
being
the
true
god
and
without
a
teaching
priest
and
without
law
and
in
those
times
there
was
no
peace
to
him
that
went
out
nor
to
him
that
came
in
but
great
vexations
were
upon
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
countries
and
nation
was
destroyed
of
nation
and
city
of
city
for
god
did
vex
them
with
all
but
when
was
dead
and
fell
into
troubles
had
quiet
ten
years
and
in
that
time
built
fenced
cities
in
and
got
up
an
army
of
men
with
which
in
the
year
of
his
reign
he
met
and
overcame
the
who
had
conquered
and
and
and
came
out
with
an
army
of
and
to
recover
the
countries
conquered
by
and
after
this
victory
dethroned
his
mother
for
idolatry
and
he
renewed
the
altar
and
brought
new
vessels
of
gold
and
silver
into
the
temple
and
he
and
the
people
entered
into
a
new
covenant
to
seek
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
upon
pain
of
death
to
those
who
worshiped
other
gods
and
his
son
took
away
the
high
places
and
in
the
third
year
of
his
reign
sent
some
of
his
princes
and
of
the
priests
and
levites
to
teach
in
the
cities
of
and
they
had
the
book
of
the
law
with
them
and
went
about
throughout
all
the
cities
of
and
taught
the
people
this
is
that
book
of
the
law
which
was
afterwards
lost
in
the
reign
of
and
found
again
in
the
reign
of
and
therefore
it
was
written
before
the
third
year
of
the
same
book
of
the
law
was
preserved
and
handed
down
to
posterity
by
the
and
therefore
was
received
by
the
ten
tribes
before
their
captivity
for
when
the
ten
tribes
were
captivated
a
priest
or
the
captivity
was
sent
back
to
by
order
of
the
king
of
to
instruct
the
new
inhabitants
of
in
manner
of
the
god
of
the
and
the
had
the
from
this
priest
as
containing
the
law
or
of
the
god
of
the
which
he
was
to
teach
them
for
they
persevered
in
the
religion
which
he
taught
them
joining
with
it
the
worship
of
their
own
gods
and
by
persevering
in
what
they
had
been
taught
they
preserved
this
book
of
their
law
in
the
original
character
of
the
while
the
two
tribes
after
their
return
from
changed
the
character
to
that
of
the
which
they
had
learned
at
and
since
the
was
received
as
the
book
of
the
law
both
by
the
two
tribes
and
by
the
ten
tribes
it
follows
that
they
received
it
before
they
became
divided
into
two
kingdoms
for
after
the
division
they
received
not
laws
from
one
another
but
continued
at
variance
could
not
reclaim
from
the
sin
of
and
could
not
bring
to
it
the
therefore
was
the
book
of
the
law
in
the
days
of
and
the
affairs
of
the
tabernacle
and
temple
were
ordered
by
and
according
to
the
law
of
this
book
and
in
the
psalm
admonishing
the
people
to
give
ear
to
the
law
of
god
means
the
law
of
this
book
for
in
describing
how
their
forefathers
kept
it
not
he
quotes
many
historical
things
out
of
the
books
of
and
the
race
of
the
kings
of
before
there
reigned
any
king
over
is
set
down
in
the
book
of
and
therefore
that
book
was
not
written
entirely
in
the
form
now
extant
before
the
reign
of
the
writer
set
down
the
race
of
those
kings
till
his
own
time
and
therefore
wrote
before
conquered
the
is
composed
of
the
law
and
the
history
of
god
people
together
and
the
history
hath
been
collected
from
several
books
such
as
were
the
history
of
the
creation
composed
by
ii
the
book
of
the
generations
of
and
the
book
of
the
wars
of
the
lord
xxi
this
book
of
wars
contained
what
was
done
at
the
and
in
the
journeying
of
thro
the
wilderness
and
therefore
was
begun
by
and
might
carry
it
on
to
the
conquest
of
for
wrote
some
things
in
the
book
of
the
law
of
god
xxiv
and
therefore
might
write
his
own
wars
in
the
book
of
wars
those
being
the
principal
wars
of
god
these
were
publick
books
and
therefore
not
written
without
the
authority
of
and
and
had
leisure
in
the
reign
of
to
put
them
into
the
form
of
the
books
of
and
now
extant
inserting
into
the
book
of
the
race
of
the
kings
of
until
there
reigned
a
king
in
the
book
of
the
is
a
continued
history
of
the
down
to
the
death
of
and
therefore
was
compiled
after
his
death
out
of
the
acts
of
the
several
things
in
this
book
are
said
to
be
done
there
was
no
king
in
xvii
xviii
xix
xxi
and
therefore
this
book
was
written
after
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
when
it
was
written
the
dwelt
in
i
and
therefore
it
was
written
before
the
eighth
year
of
and
xi
the
books
of
and
contain
one
continued
history
down
from
the
creation
to
the
death
of
where
the
ends
the
book
of
begins
and
where
the
book
of
ends
the
book
of
begins
therefore
all
these
books
have
been
composed
out
of
the
writings
of
and
other
records
by
one
and
the
same
hand
after
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
and
before
the
eighth
year
of
and
was
a
sacred
writer
x
acquainted
with
the
history
of
and
the
xii
and
had
leisure
in
the
reign
of
and
sufficient
authority
to
compose
these
books
he
was
a
prophet
and
judged
all
the
days
of
his
life
and
was
in
the
greatest
esteem
with
the
people
and
the
law
by
which
he
was
to
judge
the
people
was
not
to
be
published
by
less
authority
than
his
own
the
being
not
inferior
to
the
judge
and
the
book
of
which
is
quoted
in
the
book
of
x
was
in
being
at
the
death
of
i
at
the
dedication
of
the
temple
of
when
the
ark
was
brought
into
the
most
holy
place
there
was
nothing
in
it
but
the
two
tables
viii
and
therefore
when
the
took
the
ark
they
took
out
of
it
the
book
of
the
law
and
the
golden
pot
of
manna
and
rod
and
this
and
other
losses
in
the
desolation
of
by
the
conquering
might
give
occasion
to
after
some
respite
from
those
enemies
to
recollect
the
scattered
writings
of
and
and
the
records
of
the
patriarchs
and
judges
and
compose
them
in
the
form
now
extant
the
book
of
is
a
history
of
things
done
in
the
days
of
the
and
may
be
looked
upon
as
an
addition
to
the
book
of
the
written
by
the
same
author
and
at
the
same
time
for
it
was
written
after
the
birth
of
iv
and
not
long
after
because
the
history
of
and
the
great
grandfather
and
great
grandmother
of
and
that
of
their
contemporaries
could
not
well
be
remembered
above
two
or
three
generations
and
since
this
book
derives
the
genealogy
of
from
and
and
omits
elder
brothers
and
his
sons
it
was
written
in
honour
of
after
he
was
anointed
king
by
and
before
he
had
children
in
and
by
consequence
in
the
reign
of
it
proceeds
not
to
the
history
of
and
therefore
seems
to
have
been
written
presently
after
he
was
anointed
they
judge
well
therefore
who
ascribe
to
the
books
of
and
is
also
reputed
the
author
of
the
first
book
of
till
the
time
of
his
death
the
two
books
of
cite
no
authors
and
therefore
seem
to
be
originals
they
begin
with
his
genealogy
birth
and
education
and
might
be
written
partly
in
his
lifetime
by
himself
or
his
disciples
the
prophets
at
in
xix
and
partly
after
his
death
by
the
same
disciples
the
books
of
the
cite
other
authors
as
the
book
of
the
acts
of
the
book
of
the
of
the
kings
of
and
the
book
of
the
of
the
kings
of
the
books
of
the
cite
the
book
of
the
seer
the
book
of
the
prophet
and
the
book
of
the
seer
for
the
acts
of
the
book
of
the
prophet
the
prophecy
of
the
and
the
visions
of
the
seer
for
the
acts
of
the
book
of
the
prophet
and
the
book
of
the
seer
concerning
genealogies
for
the
acts
of
and
the
book
of
the
kings
of
and
for
the
acts
of
and
the
book
of
the
seer
for
the
acts
of
and
the
visions
of
for
the
acts
of
and
these
books
were
therefore
collected
out
of
the
historical
writings
of
the
antient
seers
and
prophets
and
because
the
books
of
the
and
quote
one
another
they
were
written
at
one
and
the
same
time
and
this
time
was
after
the
return
from
the
captivity
because
they
bring
down
the
history
of
and
the
genealogies
of
the
kings
of
and
of
the
high
priests
to
that
captivity
the
book
of
was
originally
a
part
of
the
book
of
the
and
has
been
divided
from
it
for
it
begins
with
the
two
last
verses
of
the
books
of
and
the
first
book
of
begins
with
the
two
last
chapters
thereof
was
therefore
the
compiler
of
the
books
of
and
and
brought
down
the
history
to
his
own
time
he
was
a
ready
scribe
in
the
law
of
god
and
for
assisting
him
in
this
work
founded
a
library
and
together
the
acts
of
the
kings
and
the
prophets
and
of
and
the
epistles
of
the
kings
concerning
the
holy
ii
by
the
acts
of
i
understand
here
the
two
books
of
or
at
least
the
second
book
out
of
the
acts
of
the
written
from
time
to
time
by
the
prophets
he
compos
the
books
of
the
kings
of
and
the
of
the
kings
of
and
the
of
the
kings
of
and
in
doing
this
he
joined
those
acts
together
in
due
order
of
time
copying
the
very
words
of
the
authors
as
is
manifest
from
hence
that
the
books
of
the
and
frequently
agree
with
one
another
in
words
for
many
sentences
together
where
they
agree
in
sense
there
they
agree
in
words
also
so
the
prophecies
of
written
at
several
times
he
has
collected
into
one
body
and
the
like
he
did
for
those
of
and
the
rest
of
the
prophets
down
to
the
days
of
the
second
temple
the
book
of
is
the
history
of
written
by
another
hand
the
book
of
is
a
collection
of
papers
written
at
several
times
the
six
last
chapters
contain
prophecies
written
at
several
times
by
himself
the
six
first
are
a
collection
of
historical
papers
written
by
others
the
fourth
chapter
is
a
decree
of
the
first
chapter
was
written
after
death
for
the
author
saith
that
continued
to
the
first
year
of
that
is
to
his
first
year
over
the
and
and
third
year
over
and
for
the
same
reason
the
fifth
and
sixth
chapters
were
also
written
after
his
death
for
they
end
with
these
words
this
prospered
in
the
reign
of
and
in
the
reign
of
persian
yet
these
words
might
be
added
by
the
collector
of
the
papers
whom
i
take
to
be
the
psalms
composed
by
and
others
seem
to
have
been
also
collected
by
into
one
volume
i
reckon
him
the
collector
because
in
this
collection
i
meet
with
psalms
as
late
as
the
captivity
but
with
none
later
after
these
things
spoiled
the
temple
commanded
the
to
forsake
the
law
upon
pain
of
death
and
caused
the
sacred
books
to
be
burnt
wherever
they
could
be
found
and
in
these
troubles
the
book
of
the
of
the
kings
of
was
entirely
lost
but
upon
recovering
from
this
oppression
gathered
together
all
those
writings
that
were
to
be
met
with
ii
and
in
reducing
them
into
order
part
of
the
prophecies
of
or
some
other
prophet
have
been
added
to
the
end
of
the
prophecies
of
and
the
book
of
has
been
separated
from
the
book
of
and
set
together
in
two
different
orders
in
one
order
in
the
book
of
received
into
the
canon
and
in
another
order
in
the
first
book
of
after
the
captivity
the
for
preserving
their
traditions
put
them
in
writing
in
their
and
for
preserving
their
scriptures
agreed
upon
an
edition
and
pointed
it
and
counted
the
letters
of
every
sort
in
every
book
and
by
preserving
only
this
edition
the
antienter
various
lections
except
what
can
be
discovered
by
means
of
the

are
now
lost
and
such
marginal
notes

corruptions

upon

on

of

he
had
not
yet
collected
the
writings
of

into
the
volume
now
extant
but
instituted
the
reading
of
them
after
the
collection
was
made
by
reading
the
law
and
the
prophets
in
the
synagogues
those
books
have
been
kept
freer
from
corruption
than
the
in
the
infancy
of
the
nation
of
when
god
had
given
them
a
law
and
made
a
covenant
with
them
to
be
their
god
if
they
would
keep
his
commandments
he
sent
prophets
to
reclaim
them
as
often
as
they
revolted
to
the
worship
of
other
gods
and
upon
their
returning
to
him
they
sometimes
renewed
the
covenant
which
they
had
broken
these
prophets
he
continued
to
send
till
the
days
of
but
after
their
prophecies
were
read
in
the
synagogues
those
prophecies
were
thought
sufficient
for
if
the
people
would
not
hear
and
the
old
prophets
they
would
hear
no
new
ones
no
not
they
should
rise
from
the
at
length
when
a
new
truth
was
to
be
preached
to
the
namely
jesus
was
the
god
sent
new
prophets
and
teachers
but
after
their
writings
were
also
received
and
read
in
the
synagogues
of
the
christians
prophecy
ceased
a
second
time
we
have
the
prophets
and
apostles
and
the
words
of
christ
himself
and
if
we
will
not
hear
them
we
shall
be
more
inexcusable
than
the
for
the
prophets
and
apostles
have
foretold
that
as
often
revolted
and
brake
the
covenant
and
upon
repentance
renewed
it
so
there
should
be
a
falling
away
among
the
christians
soon
after
the
days
of
the
apostles
and
that
in
the
latter
days
god
would
destroy
the
impenitent
revolters
and
make
a
new
covenant
with
his
people
and
the
giving
ear
to
the
prophets
is
a
fundamental
character
of
the
true
church
for
god
has
so
ordered
the
prophecies
that
in
the
latter

may
understand

the
prophetic
for
understanding
the
prophecies
we
are
in
the
first
place
to
acquaint
with
the

language
of

this
language
is
taken
from
the
analogy
between
the
world
natural
and
an
empire
or
kingdom
considered
as
a
world
politic
accordingly
the
whole
world
natural
consisting
of
heaven
and
earth
signifies
the
whole
world
politic
consisting
of
thrones
and
people
or
so
much
of
it
as
is
considered
in
the
prophecy
and
the
things
in
that
world
signify
the
analogous
things
in
this
for
the
heavens
and
the
things
therein
signify
thrones
and
dignities

those
who
enjoy
them

thereon

related

as
if
they

several
parts
of

general
prophecy
given
at
several
times
the
first
is
the
easiest
to
be
understood
and
every
following
prophecy
adds
something
new
to
the
former
the
first
was
given
in
a
dream
to
king
of
in
the
second
year
of
his
reign
but
the
king
forgetting
his
dream
it
was
given
again
to
in
a
dream
and
by
him
revealed
to
the
king
and
thereby
presently
became
famous
for
wisdom
and
revealing
of
secrets
insomuch
that
his
contemporary
in

nineteenth
year
of

him
to
the

there
is
a
man
in
thy
kingdom
in
whom
is
the
spirit
of
the
holy
gods
and
in
the
days
of
thy
father
light
and
understanding
and
wisdom
like
the
wisdom
of
the
gods
was
found
in
him
whom
the
king
thy
father
the
king
i
say
thy
father
made
master
of
the
magicians

soothsayers

an
excellent
spirit

knowledge

understanding

hard
sentences

doubts

whom
the
king
named
dan
was
in
the
greatest
credit
amongst
the
till
the
reign
of
the
emperor
and
to
reject
his
prophecies
is
to
reject
the
christian
religion
for
this
religion
is
founded
upon
his
prophecy

foundation
of

had
great
iron
teeth

devoured

brake
in
pieces

stamped
the
residue

such
was

it

stronger

conquered
the

by

other

it
became
greater

more
terrible

they
had
their
dominion
taken

their

people
marrying
with

by
mediation
granted
it

after
some
time
being
accused
of
a
traiterous
conspiracy
with

thereby
disappointed
of

reputed
an

not

got
up
an

revolted
from

are
to

this

to
look
upon
it
as
strengthened
by
the
access

he

after
various
great

this

in

his
reign
began
in
the

to

then
were
driven
out
of

but
this
is
a
plain
mistake
for
it
is
certain
that
the
emperor
left
the

entire

we
have
shewed
out
of
that
the
were
in

the

those
days

nothing
to
do
with

not
reign
twelve
years
he
began
his
reign
in
the
end
of

reigned
three
years

was
slain
as
and
the
manuscript
chronicles
seen
by
testify

who
carries
his

only
to
the
year
sets
down
therein
the
death
of
king
of

conjoins
it
with
that
of
which
happened
wherefore
the
of
who
reigned
at
the
least
twelve
years
is
some
other
king
and
i
suspect
that
this
name
hath
been
put
by
mistake
for
king
of
the
for
the
action
recorded
was
of
the
and
driving
the
out
of
after
the
death
of

it
is
not
likely
that
the
historian
would
refer
the
history
of
the
to
the
years
of
the
kings
this
action
happened
in
the
end
of
the
year
which
i
take
to
be
the
twelfth
year
of

which
was
almost
fifty
years
after
the

the
succeeded

of
the

about
forty
years

when

twelfth

thence
the

driven

the
were
not
so
ejected

that
they
had
further
contests
with
the
till
the
head
of
the
son
of
was
carried
to
in
the
consulship
of
and
as
relates
nor
were
they
yet
totally
ejected
the
empire
for
besides
their
reliques
in
tells
us
that
when
the
emperors
and
granted

the
which
was
in
the

they
granted
part
of

some
of
the

and
in
the
year
when
the
removing
into
made
war
there
with
the
the
a
part
of
the
who
had
taken
the
name
of
from
one
of
their
kings
assisted
the
in
that
war
and
the
afterwards
when
they
went
into
left
their
seats
in
to
the
in
recompence
of
their
friendship
from
that
time
the
grew
again
very
powerful
their
kings
whom
they
called
troubling
the
empire
much
in
the
reigns
of
the
emperors
and
and
this
is
the
original
of
the
present
kingdom
of
which
from
these
and
other
mixed
together
took
the
name
of
and
by
contraction
the
before
they
came
over
the
were
commanded
by
two
captains
and
after
whose
death
they
had
kings
was
the
son
of
who
became
their
king
according
to
in
the
consulship
of
and
reigned
thirty
three
years
according
to
and
was
slain
in
battle
by
the
places
his
death
in
the
consulship
of
and
routed
the
and
reigned
three
years
and
almost
forty
was
contemporary
to
king
of
the
in
and
led
his
people
from
into
a
country
on
the
north
side
of
next
beyond
the
from
whence
then
carried
his
people
into

the

then
bounded
on

east

on
the
south
by
the
returned
into
and
there
overcame
the
overthrew
the
kingdom
of
the
and
slew
their
king
he
assisted
the
emperor
against
king
of
the
in
and
led
his
people
out
of
into
where
they
reigned
till
the
year
according
to
the
with
many
other
nations
came
into
the
empire
from
beyond
the
in
the
reign
of
and
that
is
between
the
years
and
but
they
might
come
in
a
little
earlier
for
we
are
told
that
the
under
their
captains
and
beat
the
in
battle
and
placeth
this
victory
in
the
consulship
of
and
that
is
before
this
war
the
had
remained
quiet
forty
years
in
the
seats
granted
them
in
by
the
great
and
therefore
if
these
were
the
same
this
war
must
have
been
in
and
might
be
occasioned
by
the
coming
of
the
over
the
into
a
year
or
two
before
the
battle
and
so
have
put
an
end
to
that
quiet
which
had
lasted
forty
years
after
and
had
quieted
the
they
might
either
retire
over
the
or
continue
quiet
under
the
till
the
death
of
and
then
either
invade
the
empire
anew
or
throw
off
all
subjection
to
it
by
their
wars
first
with
the
and
then
with
the
a
nation
so
called
from
the
river
whence
they
came
it
appears
that
even
in
those
days
they
were
a
kingdom
not
contemptible
these
nine
kingdoms
being
rent
away
we
are
next
to
consider
the
residue
of
the
while
this
empire
continued
entire
it
was
the
beast
itself
but
the
residue
thereof
is
only
a
part
of
it
now
if
this
part
be
considered
as
a
horn
the
reign
of
this
horn
may
be
dated
from
the
translation
of
the
imperial
seat
from
to
which
was
in
for
then
the
emperor
fearing
that
would
besiege
him
in
if
he
staid
there
retired
to
and
thence
to
and
the
ensuing
siege
and
sacking
of
confirmed
his
residence
there
so
that
he
and
his
successors
ever
after
made
it
their
home
accordingly
in
his
history
writes
that
having
left
translated
the
seat
of
the
empire
to
belonged
to
the
emperors
so
long
as
that
empire
stood
and
then
it
descended
with
and
the
senate
to
king
of
the
in
and
after
him
to
king
of
the
and
his
successors
by
the
grant
of
the
emperors
upon
the
death
of
the
second
the
and
invaded
but
i
do
not
find
they
erected
any
settled
kingdom
there
for
in
the
year
while
they
were
yet
depopulating
they
were
attacked
and
beaten
by
master
of
the
horse
to
the
emperor
and
i
hear
nothing
more
of
their
invading
king
of
in
or
about
the
year
conquered
a
kingdom
of
the
and
slew
their
last
king
but
this
kingdom
was
seated
in
and
only
bordered
upon
for
its
people
fled
from
into
the
neighbouring
kingdom
of
the
under
who
received
them
as
friends
and
wrote
a
friendly
letter
to
in
their
behalf
and
by
this
means
they
became
inhabitants
of
as
subjects
under
the
dominion
of
the
when
the
emperor
conquered
the
he
succeeded
them
in
the
kingdom
of
not
only
by
right
of
conquest
but
also
by
right
of
inheritance
the
senate
still
going
along
with
this
kingdom
therefore
we
may
reckon
that
this
kingdom
continued
in
the
exarchate
of
and
senate
of
for
the
remainder
of
the
went
along
with
the
senate
of
by
reason
of
the
right
which
this
senate
still
retained
and
at
length
exerted
of
chusing
a
new
emperor
i
have
now
enumerated
the
ten
kingdoms
into
which
the
became
divided
at
its
first
breaking
that
is
at
the
time
of
being
besieged
and
taken
by
the
some
of
these
kingdoms
at
length
fell
and
new
ones
arose

whatever

their
number

great
things
and
his
was
more
stout
than
his
fellows
and
the
same
horn
made
war
with
the
saints
and
prevailed
against
and
one
who
stood
by
and
made
know
the
interpretation
of
these
things
told
him
that
ten
horns
were
ten
kings
that
should
arise
and
another
should
arise
after
them
and
be
diverse
from
the
first
and
he
should
subdue
three
kings
speak
great
words
against
the
most
high
and
wear
out
the
saints
and
think
to
change
times
and
laws
and
that
they
should
be
given
into
his
hands
until
a
time
and
times
and
half
a
kings
are
put
for
kingdoms
as
above
and
therefore
the
little
horn
is
a
little
kingdom
it
was
a
horn
of
the
fourth
beast
and
rooted
up
three
of
his
first
horns
and
therefore
we
are
to
look
for
it
among
the
nations
of
the
empire
after
the
rise
of
the
ten
horns
but
it
was
a
kingdom
of
a
different
kind
from
the
other
ten
kingdoms
having
a
life
or
soul
peculiar
to
itself
with
eyes
and
a
mouth
by
its
eyes
it
was
a
seer
and
by
its
mouth
speaking
great
things
and
changing
times
and
laws
it
was
a
prophet
as
well
as
a
king
and
such
a
seer
a
prophet
and
a
king
is
the
church
of
a
seer
greek
episkopos
is
a
bishop
in
the
literal
sense
of
the
word
and
this
church
claims
the
universal
bishoprick
with
his
mouth
he
gives
laws
to
kings
and
nations
as
an
oracle
and
pretends
to
infallibility
and
that
his
dictates
are
binding
to
the
whole
world
which
is
to
be
a

in
the
highest
degree
in
the
eighth
century
by

up

subduing

that
in

at

viz
took

put
an
end

this
was
the
first
of
the
three
kingdoms
which
fell
before
the
little
horn
in
the
year
pope
deposed
a
slothful
and
useless
king
of
and
the
last
of
the
race
of

absolving
his
subjects
from
their
oath
of
allegiance
gave
the
kingdom
to
the
major
of
the
palace

thereby
made
a
new
and
potent
friend
his
successor
pope
iii
knowing
better
how
to
deal
with
the
emperor
than
with
the
went
the
next
year
to
the
king
of
the
to
persuade
him
to
return
the
exarchate
to
the
emperor
but
this
not
succeeding
he
went
into
and
persuaded
to
take
the
exarchate
and
from
the
and
give
it
to
accordingly
came
with
an
army
into

made
king

the
promise
the
surrender
but
the
next
year
on
the
contrary
to
revenge
himself
on
the

besieged
the

the
pope
sent
letters
to
wherein
he
told
him
that
if
he
came
not
speedily
against
the
data

he
should
be
excommunicated
therefore
fearing
a
revolt
of
his
subjects
and
being
indebted
to
the
church
of
came
speedily
with
an
army
into
raised
the
siege
besieged
the
in
and
forced
them
to
surrender
the
exarchate
and
region
of
to
the
pope
for
a
perpetual
possession
thus
the
pope
became
lord
of

the
exarchate

few
cities
excepted

the
keys
were
sent
to

laid

henceforward
the

temporal

left
off
in
their

the

restored
to

taken
from

also
the
rest
of
the
exarchate
which
they
had
promised
to
surrender
to
him
but
had
hitherto
detained

also
gave
him
some
cities

in
return
himself
made

had
the
authority
of
confirming
the

these
things
were
done
in

years

this

which
was
to

not

in

iii
being
made
pope
notified
his
election
to

sending
to
him
for
a
present
the
golden
keys
of
the
confession

the

of
the

as
an
acknowledgment
of
the

holding
the
cities
of
the
exarchate

by
the
grant
of
the
other
as
a
signification
that
should
come
and
subdue
the
senate
and
people
of
as
he
had
done
the
exarchate
and
the
kingdom
of
the
for
the
pope
at
the
same
time
desired
to
send
some
of
his
princes
to
who
might
subject
the

to
him
and
bind
them
by
oath

in

as
his

are
recited
by

hence
arose
a
misunderstanding
between
the
pope
and
the
city
and
the
about
two
or
three
years
after
by
assistance
of
some
of
the
clergy
raised
such
tumults
against
him
as
gave
occasion
to
a
new
state
of
things
in
all
the
for
two
of
the
clergy
accused
him
of
crimes
and
the
with
an
armed
force
seized
him
stript
him
of
his
sacerdotal
habit
and
imprisoned
him
in
a
monastery
but
by
assistance
of
his
friends
he
made
his
escape
and
fled
into
to
the
great
to
whom
he
complained
of
the
for
acting
against
him
out
of
a
design
to
throw
off
all
authority
of
the
church
and
to
recover
their
antient
freedom
in
his
absence
his
accusers
with
their
forces
ravaged
the
possessions
of
the
church
and
sent
the
accusations
to
who
before
the
end
of
the
year
sent
the
pope
back
to
with
a
large
retinue
the
nobles
and
bishops
of
who
accompanied
him
examined
the
chief
of
his
accusers
at
and
sent
them
into
in
custody
this
was
in
the
year
the
next
year
himself
went
to
and
upon
a
day
appointed
presided
in
a
council
of
and
bishops
to
hear
both
parties
but
when
the
pope
adversaries
expected
to
be
heard
the
council
declared
that
he
who
was
the
supreme
judge
of
all
men
was
above
being
judged
by
any
other
than
himself
whereupon
he
made
a
solemn
declaration
of
his
innocence
before
all
the
people
and
by
doing
so
was
looked
upon
as
acquitted
soon
after
upon
the
people
of
who
had
hitherto
elected
their
bishop
and
reckoned
that
they
and
their
senate
inherited
the
rights
of
the
antient
senate
and
people
of
voted
their
emperor
and
subjected
themselves
to
him
in
such
manner
as
the
old
empire
and
their
senate
were
subjected
to
the
old
emperors
the
pope
crowned
him
and
anointed
him
with
holy
oil
and
worshipped
him
on
his
knees
after
the
manner
of
adoring
the
old
emperors
as
the
aforesaid
poet
thus
relates
laudes
igitur
dictas

the
emperor
on
the

took
the
following

the
emperor
was
also
made
consul
of
and
his
son
crowned
king
of
and
henceforward
the
emperor
stiled
himself
serenissimus

coronatus
magnus
pacificus
romæ
gubernans
or
and
was
prayed
for
in
the
churches
of
his
image
was
henceforward
put
upon
the
coins
of
while
the
enemies
of
the
pope
to
the
number
of
three
hundred
and
two
or
three
of
the
clergy
were
sentenced
to
death
the
three
hundred
were
beheaded
in
one
day
in
the
fields
but
the
clergymen
at
the
intercession
of
the
pope
were
pardoned
and
banished
into
and
thus
the
title
of
emperor
which
had
hitherto
been
in
the
emperors
was
by
this
act
transferred
in
the
to
the
kings
of
after
these
things
gave
the
city
and
duchy
of
to
the
pope
subordinately
to
himself
as
emperor
of
the
spent
the
winter
in
ordering
the
affairs
of
and
those
of
the
apostolic
see
and
of
all
both
civil
and
ecclesiastical
and
in
making
new
laws
for
them
and
returned
the
next
summer
into
leaving
the
city
under
its
senate
and
both
under
the
pope
and
himself
but
hearing
that
his
new
laws
were
not
observed
by
the
judges
in
dictating
the
law
nor
by
the
people
in
hearing
it
and
that
the
great
men
took
servants
from
free
men
and
from
the
churches
and
monasteries
to
labour
in
their
vineyards
fields
pastures
and
houses
and
continued
to
exact
cattle
and
wine
of
them
and
to
oppress
those
that
served
the
churches
he
wrote
to
his
son
to
remedy
these
abuses
to
take
care
of
the
church
and
see
his
laws
executed
now
the
senate
and
people
and
principality
of
i
take
to
be
the
third
king
the
little
horn
overcame
and
even
the
chief
of
the
three
for
this
people
elected
the
pope
and
the
emperor
and
now
by
electing
the
emperor
and
making
him
consul
was
acknowledged
to
retain
the
authority
of
the
old
senate
and
people
this
city
was
the
metropolis
of
the
old
empire
represented
in
by
the
fourth
beast
and
by
subduing
the
senate
and
people
and
duchy
it
became
the
metropolis
of
the
little
horn
of
that
beast
and
completed
patrimony
which
was
the
kingdom
of
that
horn
besides
this
victory
was
attended
with
greater
consequences
than
those
over
the
other
two
kings
for
it
set
up
the
which
continues
to
this
day
it
set
up
the
pope
above
the
judicature
of
the
senate
and
above
that
of
a
council
of
and
bishops
and
even
above
all
human
judicature
and
gave
him
the
supremacy
over
the
churches
and
their
councils
in
a
high
degree
it
gave
him
look
more
stout
than
his
so
that
when
this
new
religion
began
to
be
established
in
the
minds
of
men
he
grappled
not
only
with
kings
but
even
with
the
emperor
himself
it
is
observable
also
that
the
custom
of
kissing
the
pope
feet
an
honour
superior
to
that
of
kings
and
emperors
began
about
this
time
there
are
some
instances
of
it
in
the
ninth
century
tells
us
that
the
feet
of
pope
iv
were
kissed
according
to
antient
custom
by
all
who
came
to
him
and
some
say
that
iii
began
this
custom
pretending
that
his
hand
was
infected
by
the
kiss
of
a
woman
the
popes
began
also
about
this
time
to
canonize
saints
and
to
grant
indulgences
and
pardons
and
some
represent
that
iii
was
the
first
author
of
all
these
things
it
is
further
observable
that
the
great
between
the
years
and
conquered
all
from
the
and
northward
to
the
sea
and
eastward
to
the
river
extending
his
conquests
also
into
as
far
as
the
river
and
by
these
conquests
he
laid
the
foundation
of
the
new
empire
and
at
the
same
time
propagated
the
catholic
religion
into
all
his
conquests
obliging
the
and
who
were
heathens
to
receive
the
faith
and
distributing
his
northern
conquests
into
bishopricks
granting
tithes
to
the
clergy
and
to
the
pope
by
all
which
the
church
of
was
highly
enlarged
enriched
exalted
and
established
in
the
forementioned
upon
some
coins
of
the
great
and
their
successors
stamped
at
there
is
a
draught
of
a
piece
of
work
which
pope
iii
caused
to
be
made
in
his
palace
near
the
church
of
in
memory
of
his
sending
the
standard
or
banner
of
the
city
of
curiously
wrought

the
great

which
still
remained
there
at
the
publishing
of

three
keys

reaching

his
right

the
banner
of
the

are
a
prayer
that
in
this
undertaking
god
would
preserve
the
life
of
the
pope
and
give
victory
to
the
king
over
the
the
three
keys
in
the
lap
of
signify
the
keys
of
the
three
parts
of
his
patrimony
that
of
with
its
duchy
which
the
pope
claimed
and
was
conquering
those
of
with
the
exarchate
and
of
the
territories
taken
from
the
both
which
he
had
newly
conquered
these
were
the
three
dominions
whose
keys
were
in
the
lap
of
and
whose
crowns
are
now
worn
by
the
pope
and
by
the
conquest
of
which
he
became
the
little
horn
of
the
fourth
beast
by
giving
the
to
the
pope
with
his
right
hand
and
the
banner
of
the
city
to
the
king
with
his
left
and
by
naming
the
pope
before
the
king
in
the
inscription
may
be
understood
that
the
pope
was
then
reckoned
superior
in
dignity
to
the
kings
of
the
earth
after
the
death
of
the
great
his
son
and
successor
at
the
request
of
the
pope
confirmed
the
donations
of
his
grandfather
and
father
to
the
see
of
and
in
the
confirmation
he
names
first
with
its
duchy
extending
into
and
then
the
exarchate
of
with
and
in
the
third
place
the
territories
taken
from
the
these
are
his
three
conquests
and
he
was
to
hold
them
of
the
emperor
for
the
use
of
the
church
entirely
without
the
emperor
medling
therewith
or
with
the
jurisdiction
or
power
of
the
pope
therein
unless
called
thereto
in
certain
cases

the

content
himself
with
two

for

days
of
this

the

became

not

now
because
this

we
are
to
look

was
to

up

mighty
he
grew
mighty

towards

towards
the

therefore
he
was
to
rise
up
in
the
parts
of
those
nations
and
extend
his
dominion
towards
and
in
the
latter
time
of
the
kingdom
of
the
four
horns
it
was
to
rise
up
out
of
one
of
them
and
subdue
the
rest
but
not
by
its
own
power
it
was
to
be
assisted
by
a
foreign
power
a
power
superior
to
itself
the
power
which
took
away
the
dominion
of
the
third

of

such
a

body
of

a
horn
of
the
third
beast
of
a
new
sort
a
horn
of
the
goat
which
grew
mighty
but
not
by

a

which
rose
up

by
these
conquests
the
little
horn
exceeding
great
towards
the
south
and
towards
the
east
and
towards
the
pleasant
land
and
it
waxed
great
even
to
the
host

and
cast
down
some
of

of

words
called

abomination
of

spoken

relate
chiefly
to
the
worship

built
by

to

to

thereupon

thenceforward
banished

i
saith
one
saint
speaking
and
another
saint
said
unto
that
certain
saint
which
spake
how
long
shall
be
the
vision
concerning
the
daily
sacrifice
and
the
transgression
of
desolation
to
give
both
the
sanctuary

trodden
under
foot

he
said
unto
me
unto
two
thousand
and
three
hundred
days
then
shall
the
sanctuary
be
days
are
years
and
these
years
may
perhaps
be
reckoned
either
from
the
destruction
of
the
temple
by
the
in
the
reign
of
or
from
the
pollution
of
the
sanctuary
by
the
worship
of

from
the
desolation
of
made
in
the
end
of
the
war
by
the
banishment
of
all
the
out
of
their
own
country
or
from
some
other
period
which
time
will
discover
henceforward
the
last
horn
of
the
goat
continued
mighty
under
the
till
the
reign
of
the
great
and
his
sons
and
then
by
the
division
of
the
empire
between
the
and
emperors
it
separated
from
the
and
became
the
empire
alone
but
yet
under
the
dominion
of
a
family
and
at
present
it
is
mighty
under
the
dominion
of
the
this
last
horn
is
by
some
taken
for
but
not
very
judiciously
a
horn
of
a
beast
is
never
taken
for
a
single
person
it
always
signifies
a
new
kingdom
and
the
kingdom
of
was
an
old
one
reigned
over
one
of
the
four
horns
and
the
little
horn
was
a
fifth
under
its
proper
kings
this
horn
was
at
first
a
little
one
and
waxed
exceeding
great
but
so
did
not
it
is
described
great
above
all
the
former
horns
and
so
was
not
his
kingdom
on
the
contrary
was
weak
and
tributary
to
the
and
he
did
not
enlarge
it
the
horn
was
a
of
fierce
countenance
and
destroyed
wonderfully
and
prospered
and
that
is
he
prospered
in
his
practises
against
the
holy
people
but
was
frighted
out
of
by
a
mere
message
of
the
and
afterwards
routed
and
baffled
by
the
the
horn
was
mighty
by
another
power
acted
by
his
own
the
horn
stood
up
against
the
prince
of
the
host
of
heaven
the
prince
of
princes
and
this
is
the
character
not
of
but
of
the
horn
cast
down
the
sanctuary
to
the
ground
and
so
did
not
he
left
it
standing
the
sanctuary
and
host
were
trampled
under
foot
days
and
in
prophecies
days
are
put
for
years
but
the
profanation
of
the
temple
in
the
reign
of
did
not
last
so
many
natural
days
these
were
to
last
till
the
time
of
the
end
till
the
last
end
of
the
indignation
against
the
and
this
indignation
is
not
yet
at
an
end
they
were
to
last
till
the
sanctuary
which
had
been
cast
down
should
be
cleansed
and
the
sanctuary
is
not
yet
cleansed
this
prophecy
of
the
ram
and
is
repeated
in
the
last
prophecy
of
there
the
angel
tells
that
stood
up
to
strengthen
the
and
that
there
should
stand
up
yet
three
kings
in
and
the
be
far
richer
than
they
all
and
by
his
wealth
thro
his
riches
he
should
stir
up
all
against
the
realm
of
this
relates
to
the
ram
whose
two
horns
were
the
kingdoms
of
and
then
he
goes
on
to
describe
the
horns
of
the
goat
by
the
up
of
a
mighty
king
which
should
rule
with
great
dominion
and
do
according
to
his
and
by
the
breaking
of
his
kingdom
into
four
smaller
kingdoms
and
not
descending
to
his
own
posterity
then
he
describes
the
actions
of
two
of
those
kingdoms
which
bordered
on
and
calling
them
the
kings
of
the
and
that
is
in
respect
of
and
he
carries
on
the
description
till
the
latter
end
of
the
kingdoms
of
the
four
and
till
the
reign
of
when
transgressors
were
come
to
the
full
in
the
eighth
year
of
the
year
in
which
he
profaned
the
temple
and
set
up
the
heathen
gods
in
all
and
the
conquered
the
kingdom
of
the
prophetic
angel
leaves
off
describing
the
affairs
of
the
kings
of

begins
to
describe
those

from

that
the

should

whereby
should

should

words
called

the
or
the

by
joining
the
accomplishment
of
the
vision
with
the
expiation
of
sins
the
years
are
ended
with
the
death
of
now
the
dispersed
became
a
people
and
city
when
they
first
returned
into
a
polity
or
body
politick
and
this
was
in
the
seventh
year
of
when
returned
with
a
body
of
from
captivity
and
revived
the
worship
and
by
the
king
commission
created
magistrates
in
all
the
land
to
judge
and
govern
the
people
according
to
the
laws
of
god
and
the
king
vii
there
were
but
two
returns
from
captivity
and
in
they
had
only
commission
to
build
the
temple
in
they
first
became
a
polity
or
city
by
a
government
of
their
own
now
the
years
of
this
began
about
two
or
three
months
after
the
summer
solstice
and
his
seventh
year
fell
in
with
the
third
year
of
the
eightieth
and
the
latter
part
thereof
wherein
went
up
to
was
in
the
year
of
the
count
the
time
from
thence
to
the
death
of
and
you
will
find
it
just
years
if
you
count
in
years
commencing
in
autumn
and
date
the
reckoning
from
the
first
autumn
after
coming
to
when
he
put
the
king
decree
in
execution
the
death
of
will
fall
on
the
year
of
the
and
the
weeks
will
be
weeks
ending
with
sabbatical
years
and
this
i
take
to
be
the
truth
but
if
you
had
rather
place
the
death
of
in
the
year
before
as
is
commonly
done
you
may
take
the
year
of
journey
into
the
reckoning
also
and
understand
that
from
the
going
forth
of
the
commandment
to
cause
to
return
and
to
build
unto
the
anointed
the
prince
shall
be
seven
the
former
part
of
the
prophecy
related
to
the
first
coming
of
being
dated
to
his
coming
as
a
prophet
this
being
dated
to
his
coming
to
be
prince
or
king
seems
to
relate
to
his
second
coming
there
the
prophet
was
consummate
and
the
most
holy
anointed
here
he
that
was
anointed
comes
to
be
prince
and
to
reign
for
prophecies
reach
to
the
end
of
the
world
and
there
is
scarce
a
prophecy
in
the
old
testament
concerning
which
doth
not
in
something
or
other
relate
to
his
second
coming
if
divers
of
the
antients
as
the
martyr
and
bishop
of
applied
the
half
week
to
the
times
of
why
may
not
we
by
the
same
liberty
of
interpretation
apply
the
seven
weeks
to
the
time
when
shall
be
destroyed
by
the
brightness
of
coming
the
in
the
days
of
the
antient
prophets
when
the
ten
tribes
were
led
into
captivity
expected
a
double
return
and
that
at
the
first
the
should
build
a
new
temple
inferior
to
until
the
time
of
that
age
should
be
fulfilled
and
afterwards
they
should
return
from
all
places
of
their
captivity
and
build
and
the
temple
gloriously
xiv
and
to
express
the
glory
and
excellence
of
this
city
it
is
figuratively
said
to
be
built
of
precious
stones
xiii
liv
xi
and
called
the
the
the
the
the
of
the
great
the
into
which
the
kings
of
the
earth
do
bring
their
glory
and
while
such
a
return
from
captivity
was
the
expectation
of
even
before
the
times
of
i
know
not
why
should
omit
it
in
his
prophecy
this
part
of
the
prophecy
being
therefore
not
yet
fulfilled
i
shall
not
attempt
a
particular
interpretation
of
it
but
content
myself
with
observing
that
as
the
and
the
two
were
weeks
ending
with
sabbatical
years
so
the
are
the
compass
of
a
and
begin
and
end
with
actions
proper
for
a
and
of
the
highest
nature
for
which
a
can
be
kept
and
that
since
commandment
to
return
and
to
build
precedes
the
the
years
it
may
perhaps
come
forth
not
from
the
themselves
but
from
some
other
kingdom
friendly
to
them
and
precede
their
return
from
captivity
and
give
occasion
to
it
and
lastly
that
this
rebuilding
of
and
the
waste
places
of
is
predicted
in
vii
ix
xxxvi
liv
lv
lxi
lxv
and
xiv
and
that
the
return
from
captivity
and
coming
of
the
and
his
kingdom
are
described
in
vii
xix
i
xxiv
iii
xxxvi
xxxvii
lx
lxii
lxiii

and
lxvi
and
many
other
places
of

manner
i
know
not
let
time

the
interpreter
threescore
and
two
weeks
shall
it
return
and
the
street
be
built
and
the
wall
but
in
troublesome
times
and
after
the
threescore
and
two
weeks
the
shall
be
cut
off
and
it
shall
not
be
his
but
the
people
of
a
prince

destroy
the
city
and
the
having
foretold
both
comings
of
and
dated
the
last
from
their
returning
and
building
to
prevent
the
applying
that
to
the
building
by
he
distinguishes
this
from
that
by
saying
that
from
this
period
to
the
shall
be
not
seven
weeks
but
threescore
and
two
weeks
and
this
not
in
prosperous
but
in
troublesome

at
the
end
of

weeks
the
shall
not
be
the
prince
of

but
be
cut
off
and
not
be
his
but
the
city
and
sanctuary
be
destroyed
now
came
to
in
the
year
of
this
same
while
still
continued
there

and
found
the
city
lying

the
houses
and

unbuilt

and
finished
the
wall
the
day
of
the
month

in
the
year
of

is
in
in
the
year
of
the
count
now
from
this
year
threescore
and
two
weeks
of
years
that
is
years
and
the
reckoning
will
end
in
in
the
year
of
the
which
is
the
year
in
which
was
born
according
to
and
other
antients
and
this
was
the
general
opinion
till
invented
the
vulgar
account
in
which
birth
is
placed
two
years
later
if
with
some
you
reckon
that
was
born
three
or
four
years
before
the
vulgar
account
yet
his
birth
will
fall
in
the
latter
part
of
the
last
week
which
is
enough
how
after
these
weeks
was
cut
off
and
the
city
and
sanctuary
destroyed
by
the
is
well
known
shall
he
confirm
the
covenant
with
many
for
one
he
kept
it
notwithstanding
his
death
till
the
rejection
of
the
and
calling
of
and
the
in
the
seventh
year
after
his
passion
in
half
a
week
he
shall
cause
the
sacrifice
and
oblation
to
that
is
by
the
war
of
the
upon
the
which
war
after
some
commotions
began
in
the
year
of
in
the
spring
when
with
an
army
invaded
them
and
ended
in
the
second
year
of
in
autumn
when
took
the
city
having
burnt
the
temple
days
before
so
that
it
lasted
three
years
and
an
half
upon
a
wing
of
abominations
he
shall
cause
desolation
even
until
the
consummation
and
that
which
is
determined
be
poured
upon
the
the
prophets
in
representing
kingdoms
by
beasts
and
birds
put
their
wings
stretcht
out
over
any
country
for
their
armies
sent
out
to
invade
and
rule
over
that
country
hence
a
wing
of
abominations
is
an
army
of
false
gods
for
an
abomination
is
often
put
in
scripture
for
a
false
god
as
where
is
called
the
abomination
of
and
the
abomination
of
the
meaning
therefore
is
that
the
people
of
a
prince
to
come
shall
destroy
the
sanctuary
and
abolish
the
daily
worship
of
the
true
god
and
overspread
the
land
with
an
army
of
false
gods
and
by
setting
up
their
dominion
and
worship
cause
desolation
to
the
until
the
times
of
the
be
fulfilled
for
tells
us
that
the
abomination
of
desolation
spoken
of
by
was
to
be
set
up
in
the
times
of
the
xxiv
thus
have
we
in
this
short
prophecy
a
prediction
of
all
the
main
periods
relating
to
the
coming
of
the
the
time
of
his
birth
that
of
his
death
that
of
the
rejection
of
the
the
duration
of
the
war
whereby
he
caused
the
city
and
sanctuary
to
be
destroyed
and
the
time
of
his
second
coming
and
so
the
interpretation
here
given
is
more
full
and
complete
and
adequate
to
the
design
than
if
we
should
restrain
it
to
his
first
coming
only
as
interpreters
usually
do
we
avoid
also
the
doing
violence
to
the
language
of
by
taking
the
and
two
for
one
number
had
that
been
meaning
he
would
have
said
and
nine
and
not
and
two
a
way
of
numbring
used
by
no
nation
in
our
way
the
years
are
as
they
ought
to
be
and
the
weeks
of
are
ending
with
which
is
very
remarkable
for
they
end
either
with
the
year
of
the
birth
of
two
years
before
the
vulgar
account
or
with
the
year
of
his
death
or
with
the
seventh
year
after
it
all
which
are
others
either
count
by
lunar
years
or
by
weeks
not
and
which
is
worst
they
ground
their
interpretations
on
erroneous
chronology
excepting
the
opinion
of
about
the
which
is
the
same
with
ours
for
they
place
and
in
the
reign
of
and
the
building
of
the
temple
in
the
reign
of
and
date
the
weeks
of
from
those
two
reigns
the
grounds
of
the
chronology
here
followed
i
will
now
set
down
as
briefly
as
i
can
the
war
began
in
spring
as
and
all
other
authors
agree
it
began
two
months
before
ceased
to
be
that
is
in
two
months
before
the
end
of
the
year
now
the
years
of
this
war
are
most
certainly
determined
by
the
years
distance
of
its
first
year
from
the
transit
of
inclusively
or
years
exclusively
apud
clem
by
the
years
distance
of
its
end
or
year
from
the
beginning
of
reign
in
by
the
acting
of
the
games
in
its
and
years
and
by
three
eclipses
of
the
sun
and
one
of
the
moon
mentioned
by
and
now
an
unquestionable
witness
tells
us
that
the
news
of
the
death
of
was
brought
to
and
from
thence
by
some
to
in
the
year
of
this
war
when
the
winter
half
year
was
running
and
therefore
he
died
in
the
end
of
suppose
a
month
or
two
before
midwinter
for
so
long
the
news
would
be
in
coming
now
reigned
years
by
the
consent
of
or
according
to
in
can
clem
chron
including
therein
the
reign
of
his
successors
and
as
informs
us
after
reigned
his
son
two
months
and
seven
months
but
their
reign
is
not
reckoned
apart
in
summing
up
the
years
of
the
kings
but
is
included
in
the
or
years
reign
of
omit
these
nine
months
and
the
precise
reign
of
will
be
thirty
nine
years
and
three
months
and
therefore
since
his
reign
ended
in
the
beginning
of
winter
it
began
between
midsummer
and
autumn
the
same
thing
i
gather
also
thus
began
his
reign
in
spring
and
reigned
eight
years
including
the
five
months
of
and
then
began
in
spring
and
reigned
thirty
six
years
by
the
unanimous
consent
of
all
chronologers
the
reigns
of
these
two
kings
are
determined
by
three
eclipses
of
the
moon
observed
at
and
recorded
by
so
that
it
can
not
be
disputed
one
was
in
the
seventh
year
of
at
at
night
another
in
the
year
of
at
at
night
a
third
in
the
year
of
at
at
night
by
these
eclipses
and
the
prophecies
of
and
compared
together
it
is
manifest
that
his
years
began
after
the
day
of
the
month
and
before
the
day
of
and
by
consequence
about
therefore
began
in
spring
for
died
in
the
fifth
year
after
the
battle
at
as
and
mention
and
that
battle
was
in
ten
years
before
the
battle
at
therefore
began
within
less
than
a
year
after
suppose
in
the
spring
following
for
he
spent
his
first
five
years
and
something
more
in
preparations
for
his
expedition
against
the
and
this
expedition
was
in
the
time
of
the
games
athenis
years
after
the
and
consulship
of
the
first
consul

the
passage
of

over

began
in
the
end
of
the
fourth
year
of
the
that
is
in
and
took
up
one
month
and
in
autumn
three
months
after
on
the
full
moon
the
day
of
the
month
was
the
battle
at
and
a
little
after
that
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
which
by
the
calculation
fell
on
his
sixth
year
therefore
began
a
little
before
suppose
in
spring
and
his
first
year
consequently
in
spring
as
above
now
he
reigned
almost
twenty
one
years
by
the
consent
of
all
writers
add
the
months
of
and
the
sum
will
be
years
and
about
four
or
five
months
which
end
between
midsummer
and
autumn
at
this
time
therefore
began
the
reign
of
his
successor
as
was
to
be
proved
the
same
thing
is
also
confirmed
by
who
informs
us
out
of
former
writers
that
the
year
of
this
was
the
year
from
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
in
and
fell
in
with
it
began
therefore
with
the
year
soon
after
the
summer
solstice
subduct
nineteen
years
and
his
first
year
will
begin
at
the
same
time
of
the
year
as
above
his
year
therefore
began
after
midsummer
and
the
journey
of

this
solemnity

these

in

used
the
names

by
those

understood

that
the

lost

those

their
sacred

first
month
was
on

visible

was
nearest

whether
used
the

is
not
very
material
the
difference
being
but
six
hours
in
a
year

months
in
years
but
i
take
his
months
to
be
first
because
was
a
and
the
even
by
the
names
of
the
months
understood
the
months
of
their
own
year
secondly
because
this
prophecy
is
grounded
on
concerning
the
years
captivity
and
therefore
must
be
understood
of
the
same
sort
of
years
with
the
seventy
and
those
are
since
that
prophecy
was
given
in
before
the
captivity
and
lastly
because
reckons
by
weeks
of
years
which
is
a
way
of
reckoning
peculiar
to
the
years
for
as
their
days
ran
by
sevens
and
the
last
day
of
every
seven
was
a
sabbath
so
their
years
ran
by
sevens
and
the
last
year
of
every
seven
was
a
sabbatical
year
and
seven
such
weeks
of
years
made
a
chap
xi
the
times
of
the
birth
and
passion
of
the
times
of
the
birth
and
passion
of
with
such
like
niceties
being
not
material
to
religion
were
little
regarded
by
the
of
the
first
age
they
who
began
first
to
celebrate
them
placed
them
in
the
cardinal
periods
of
the
year
as
the
annunciation
of
the
virgin
on
the
of
which
when
corrected
the
calendar
was
the
vernal
equinox
the
feast
of
baptist
on
the
of
which
was
the
summer
solstice
the
feast
of
on
which
was
the
autumnal
equinox
and
the
birth
of
on
the
winter
solstice
with
the
feasts
of
and
the
as
near
it
as
they
could
place
them
and
because
the
solstice
in
time
removed
from
the
of
to
the
the
the
and
so
on
backwards
hence
some
in
the
following
centuries
placed
the
birth
of
on
and
at
length
on
and
for
the
same
reason
they
seem
to
have
set
the
feast
of
on
and
that
of
on
so
also
at
the
entrance
of
the
sun
into
all
the
signs
in
the
calendar
they
placed
the
days
of
other
saints
as
the
conversion
of
on
when
the
sun
entred
aquarius
on
when
he
entred
pisces
on
when
he
entred
taurus
on
when
he
entred
gemini
on
when
he
entred
cancer
on
when
he
entred
virgo
and
on
when
he
entred
scorpio
and
if
there
were
any
other
remarkable
days
in
the
calendar
they
placed
the
saints
upon
them
as
on
where
seems
to
place
the
feast
of
and
and
the
goddess
and
and
on
the
first
of
a
day
dedicated
both
to
the
or
and
to
the
goddess
and
still
celebrated
with
her
rites
all
which
shews
that
these
days
were
fixed
in
the
first
calendars
by
mathematicians
at
pleasure
without
any
ground
in
tradition
and
that
the
afterwards
took
up
with
what
they
found
in
the
calendars
neither
was
there
any
certain
tradition
about
the
years
of
for
the
who
first
began
to
enquire
into
these
things
as
and
as
many
as
place
the
death
of
in
the
or
year
of
make
to
have
preached
but
one
year
or
at
most
but
two
at
length
discovered
four
successive
passovers
in
the
gospel
of
and
thereupon
set
on
foot
an
opinion
that
he
preacht
three
years
and
an
half
and
so
died
in
the
year
of
others
afterwards
finding
the
opinion
that
he
died
in
the
equinox
more
consonant
to
the
times
of
the
passover
in
the
and
years
have
placed
his
death
in
one
of
those
two
years
neither
is
there
any
greater
certainty
in
the
opinions
about
the
time
of
his
birth
the
first
placed
his
baptism
near
the
beginning
of
the
year
of
and
thence
reckoning
thirty
years
backwards
placed
his
birth
in
the
year
the
of
and
of
the
victory
this
was
the
opinion
which
obtained
in
the
first
ages
till
placing
the
baptism
of
in
the
year
of
and
misinterpreting
the
text
of
iii
as
if
was
only
beginning
to
be
years
old
when
he
was
baptized
invented
the
vulgar
account
in
which
his
birth
is
placed
two
years
later
than
before
as
therefore
relating
to
these
things
there
is
no
tradition
worth
considering
let
us
lay
aside
all
and
examine
what
prejudices
can
be
gathered
from
records
of
good
account
the
fifteenth
year
of
began
so
soon
as
the
winter
was
over
and
the
weather
became
warm
enough
we
may
reckon
that
began
to
baptize
and
that
before
next
winter
his
fame
went
abroad
and
all
the
people
came
to
his
baptism
and
among
the
rest
whence
the
first
passover
after
his
baptism
mentioned
ii
was
in
the
year
of
after
this
feast
came
into
the
land
of
and
staid
there
baptizing
whilst
was
baptizing
in
iii
but
when
he
heard
that
was
cast
into
prison
he
departed
into
iii
being
afraid
because
the
pharisees
had
heard
that
he
baptized
more
disciples
than
iv
and
in
his
journey
he
passed
thro
four
months
before
the
harvest
iv
that
is
about
the
time
of
the
winter
solstice
for
their
harvest
was
between
and
and
began
about
a
month
after
the
vernal
equinox
not
saith
he
are
yet
four
months
and
then
cometh
harvest
behold
i
say
unto
you
lift
up
your
eyes
and
look
on
the
fields
for
they
are
white
already
to
meaning
that
the
people
in
the
fields
were
ready
for
the
gospel
as
his
next
words
shew
therefore
was
imprisoned
about
in
the
year
of
and
thereupon
went
from
to
of
in
and
was
received
there
of
the
who
had
seen
all
he
did
at
at
the
passover
and
when
a
nobleman
of
heard
he
was
returned
into
and
went
to
him
and
desired
him
to
come
and
cure
his
son
he
went
not
thither
yet
but
only
said
thy
way
thy
son
liveth
and
the
nobleman
returned
and
found
it
so
and
believed
he
and
his
john
iv
this
is
the
beginning
of
his
miracles
in
and
thus
far
is
full
and
distinct
in
relating
the
actions
of
his
first
year
omitted
by
the
other
evangelists
the
rest
of
his
history
is
from
this
time
related
more
fully
by
the
other
evangelists
than
by
for
what
they
relate
he
omits
from
this
time
therefore
taught
in
the
synagogues
of
on
the
being
glorified
of
all
and
coming
to
his
own
city
and
preaching
in
their
synagogue
they
were
offended
and
thrust
him
out
of
the
city
and
led
him
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
on
which
the
city
was
built
to
cast
him
headlong
but
he
passing
thro
the
midst
of
them
went
his
way
and
came
and
dwelt
at
iv
and
by
this
time
we
may
reckon
the
second
passover
was
either
past
or
at
hand
all
this
time
passeth
over
in
few
words
and
here
begins
to
relate
the
preaching
and
miracles
of
saith
he
heard
that
was
cast
into
prison
he
departed
into
and
leaving
he
came
and
dwelt
at
and
from
that
time
began
to
preach
and
say
repent
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
matth
iv
afterwards
he
called
his
disciples
and
and
then
about
galilee
in
the
synagogues
and
healing
all
manner
of
sickness
and
his
fame
went
all
and
they
brought
unto
him
all
sick
people
and
there
followed
him
great
multitudes
of
people
from
and
from
and
from
and
from
and
from
beyond
matth
iv
all
this
was
done
before
the
sermon
in
the
mount
and
therefore
we
may
certainly
reckon
that
the
second
passover
was
past
before
the
preaching
of
that
sermon
the
multitudes
that
followed
him
from
and
shew
that
he
had
lately
been
there
at
the
feast
the
sermon
in
the
mount
was
made
when
great
multitudes
came
to
him
from
all
places
and
followed
him
in
the
open
fields
which
is
an
argument
of
the
and
in
this
sermon
he
pointed
at
the
lilies
of
the
field
then
in
the
flower
before
the
eyes
of
his
auditors
saith
he
lilies
of
the
field
how
they
grow
they
toil
not
neither
do
they
spin
and
yet
in
all
his
glory
was
not
arayed
like
one
of
these
wherefore
if
god
so
clothe
the
grass
of
the
field
which
to
day
is
and
to
morrow
is
cast
into
the
vi
so
therefore
the
grass
of
the
field
was
now
in
the
flower
and
by
consequence
the
month
of
with
the
passover
was
past
let
us
see
therefore
how
the
rest
of
the
feasts
follow
in
order
in
gospel
for
he
was
an
of
what
he
relates
and
so
tells
all
things
in
due
order
of
time
which
and
do
not
some
time
after
the
sermon
in
the
mount
when
the
time
came
that
he
should
be
received
that
is
when
the
time
of
a
feast
came
that
he
should
be
received
by
the
he
set
his
face
to
go
to
and
as
he
went
with
his
disciples
in
the
way
when
the
in
his
passage
thro
had
denied
him
lodgings
and
a
certain
scribe
said
unto
him
i
will
follow
thee
whithersoever
thou
jesus
unto
him
the
foxes
have
holes
and
the
birds
of
the
air
have
nests
but
the
son
of
man
hath
not
where
to
lay
his
matth
viii
luke
ix
the
scribe
told
he
would
bear
him
company
in
his
journey
and
replied
that
he
wanted
a
lodging
now
this
feast
i
take
to
be
the
feast
of
tabernacles
because
soon
after
i
find
and
his
apostles
on
the
sea
of
in
a
storm
so
great
that
the
ship
was
covered
with
water
and
in
danger
of
sinking
till
rebuked
the
winds
and
the
matth
viii
for
this
storm
shews
that
winter
was
now
come
on
after
this
did
many
miracles
and
about
all
the
cities
and
villages
of
teaching
in
their
synagogues
and
preaching
the
gospel
of
the
kingdom
and
healing
every
sickness
and
every
disease
among
the
matth
ix
he
then
sent
forth
the
twelve
to
do
the
like
and
at
length
when
he
had
received
a
message
from
and
answered
it
he
said
to
the
multitudes
the
days
of
the
baptist
until
now
the
kingdom
of
heaven
suffereth
and
upbraided
the
cities
and
wherein
most
of
his
mighty
works
were
done
because
they
repented
not
xi
which
several
passages
shew
that
from
the
imprisonment
of
till
now
there
had
been
a
considerable
length
of
time
the
winter
was
now
past
and
the
next
passover
was
at
hand
for
immediately
after
this
in
chap
xii
subjoins
that
went
on
the
thro
the
corn
and
his
disciples
were
an
hungred
and
began
to
pluck
the
ears
of
corn
and
to
eat
rubbing
saith
their
the
corn
therefore
was
not
only
in
the
ear
but
ripe
and
consequently
the
passover
in
which
the
were
always
offered
before
the
harvest
was
now
come
or
past
calls
this
sabbath
greek
deuteroprôton
the
second
prime
sabbath
that
is
the
second
of
the
two
great
feasts
of
the
passover
as
we
call
day
high
and
its
low
or
so
calls
the
feast
on
the
seventh
day
of
the
unlevened
bread
the
second
of
the
two
prime
sabbaths
in
one
of
the
sabbaths
following
he
went
into
a
synagogue
and
healed
a
man
with
a
withered
hand
xii
vi
and
when
the
pharisees
took
counsel
to
destroy
him
withdrew
himself
from
thence
and
great
multitudes
followed
him
and
he
healed
them
all
and
charged
them
that
they
should
not
make
him
matth
xii
afterwards
being
in
a
ship
and
the
multitude
standing
on
the
shore
he
spake
to
them
three
parables
together
taken
from
the
sowing
the
fields
xiii
by
which
we
may
know
that
it
was
now
and
by
consequence
that
the
feast
of
tabernacles
was
past
after
this
he
went
his
own
country
and
taught
them
in
their
but
not
many
mighty
works
there
because
of
their
then
the
twelve
having
been
abroad
a
year
returned
and
told
all
that
they
had
done
and
at
the
same
time
beheaded
in
prison
and
his
disciples
came
and
told
and
when
heard
it
he
took
the
twelve
and
departed
thence
privately
by
ship
into
a
desert
place
belonging
to
and
the
people
when
they
knew
it
followed
him
on
foot
out
of
the
cities
the
winter
being
now
past
and
he
healed
their
sick
and
in
the
desert
fed
them
to
the
number
of
five
thousand
men
besides
women
and
children
with
only
five
loaves
and
two
fishes
xiv
ix
at
the
doing
of
which
miracle
the
passover
of
the
was
nigh
vi
but
went
not
up
to
this
feast
but
these
things
walked
in
because
the
at
the
passover
before
had
taken
counsel
to
destroy
him
and
still
to
kill
john
vii
henceforward
therefore
he
is
found
first
in
the
coast
of
and
then
by
the
sea
of
afterwards
in
the
coast
of
and
lastly
at
xv
xvi
xvii
afterwards
when
the
feast
of
tabernacles
was
at
hand
his
brethren
upbraided
him
for
walking
secretly
and
urged
him
to
go
up
to
the
feast
but
he
went
not
till
they
were
gone
and
then
went
up
privately
vii
and
when
the
sought
to
stone
him
he
escaped
viii
after
this
he
was
at
the
feast
of
the
dedication
in
winter
x
and
when
they
sought
again
to
take
him
he
fled
beyond
x
xix
where
he
stayed
till
the
death
of
and
then
came
to
near
and
raised
him
xi
whereupon
the
took
counsel
from
that
time
to
kill
him
and
he
no
more
openly
among
the
but
went
thence
into
a
country
near
to
the
wilderness
into
a
city
called
and
there
continued
with
his
till
the
last
passover
in
which
the
put
him
to
death
xi
thus
have
we
in
the
gospels
of
and
compared
together
the
history
of
actions
in
continual
order
during
five
passovers
is
more
distinct
in
the
beginning
and
end
in
the
middle
what
either
omits
the
other
supplies
the
first
passover
was
between
the
baptism
of
and
the
imprisonment
of
ii
the
second
within
four
months
after
the
imprisonment
of
and
beginning
to
preach
in
iv
and
therefore
it
was
either
that
feast
to
which
went
up
when
the
scribe
desired
to
follow
him
viii
ix
or
the
feast
before
it
the
third
was
the
next
feast
after
it
when
the
corn
was
eared
and
ripe
xii

the
fourth
was
that
which
was
nigh
at
hand
when
wrought
the
miracle
of
the
five
loaves
xiv

and
the
fifth
was
that
in
which
suffered
xx

between
the
first
and
second
passover
and
baptized
together
till
the
imprisonment
of
which
was
four
months
before
the

then
began
to
preach
and
call
his
disciples
and
after
he
had
instructed
them
a
year
lent
them
to
preach
in
the
cities

the
same
time
hearing
of
the
fame
of
sent
to
him
to
know
who
he
was
at
the
third
the
chief
priests
began
to
consult
about
the
death
of
a
little
before
the
fourth
the
twelve
after
they
had
preached
a
year
in
all
the
cities
returned
to
and
at
the
same
time
beheaded
in
prison
after
he
had
been
in
prison
two
years
and
a
quarter
and
thereupon
fled
into
the
desart
for
fear
of
the
fourth
went
not
up
to
for
fear
of
the
who
at
the
passover
before
had
consulted
his
death
and
because
his
time
was
not
yet
come
thenceforward
therefore
till
the
feast
of
tabernacles
he
walked
in
and
that
secretly
for
fear
of
and
after
the
feast
of
tabernacles
he
returned
no
more
into
but
sometimes
was
at
and
sometimes
retired
beyond
or
to
the
city
by
the
wilderness
till
the
passover
in
which
he
was
betrayed
apprehended
and
crucified
therefore
baptized
two
summers
and
preached
three
the
first
summer
preached
to
make
himself
known
in
order
to
give
testimony
to
then
after
came
to
his
baptism
and
was
made
known
to
him
he
baptized
another
summer
to
make
known
by
his
testimony
and
also
baptized
the
same
summer
to
make
himself
the
more
known
and
by
reason
of
testimony
there
came
more
to
baptism
than
to
the
winter
following
was
imprisoned
and
now
his
course
being
at
an
end
entered
upon
his
proper
office
of
preaching
in
the
cities
in
the
beginning
of
his
preaching
he
completed
the
number
of
the
twelve
apostles
and
instructed
them
all
the
first
year
in
order
to
send
them
abroad
before
the
end
of
this
year
his
fame
by
his
preaching
and
miracles
was
so
far
spread
abroad
that
the
at
the
passover
following
consulted
how
to
kill
him
in
the
second
year
of
his
preaching
it
being
no
longer
safe
for
him
to
converse
openly
in
he
sent
the
twelve
to
preach
in
all
their
cities
and
in
the
end
of
the
year
they
returned
to
him
and
told
him
all
they
had
done
all
the
last
year
the
twelve
continued
with
him
to
be
instructed
more
perfectly
in
order
to
their
preaching
to
all
nations
after
his
death
and
upon
the
news
of
death
being
afraid
of
as
well
as
of
the
he
walked
this
year
more
secretly
than
before
frequenting
desarts
and
spending
the
last
half
of
the
year
in
without
the
dominions
of
thus
have
we
in
the
gospels
of
and
all
things
told
in
due
order
from
the
beginning
of
preaching
to
the
death
of
and
the
years
distinguished
from
one
another
by
such
essential
characters
that
they
can
not
be
mistaken
the
second
passover
is
distinguished
from
the
first
by
the
interposition
of
imprisonment
the
third
is
distinguished
from
the
second
by
a
double
character
first
by
the
interposition
of
the
feast
to
which
went
up
viii
ix
and
secondly
by
the
distance
of
time
from
the
beginning
of
preaching
for
the
second
was
in
the
beginning
of
his
preaching
and
the
third
so
long
after
that
before
it
came
said
the
days
of
the
baptist
until
and
upbraided
the
cities
of
for
their
not
repenting
at
his
preaching
and
mighty
works
done
in
all
that
time
the
fourth
is
distinguished
from
the
third
by
the
mission
of
the
twelve
from
to
preach
in
the
cities
of
in
all
the
interval
the
fifth
is
distinguished
from
all
the
former
by
the
twelve
being
returned
from
preaching
and
continuing
with
during
all
the
interval
between
the
fourth
and
fifth
and
by
the
passion
and
other
infallible
characters
now
since
the
first
summer
of
baptizing
fell
in
the
fifteenth
year
of
the
emperor
and
by
consequence
the
first
of
these
five
passovers
in
his
sixteenth
year
the
last
of
them
in
which
suffered
will
fall
on
the
twentieth
year
of
the
same
emperor
and
by
consequence
in
the
consulship
of
and
in
the
year
and
year
of
which
was
the
sabbatical
year
of
the
and
that
it
did
so
i
further
confirm
by
these
arguments
i
take
it
for
granted
that
the
passion
was
on
friday
the
day
of
the
month
the
great
feast
of
the
passover
on
saturday
the
day
of
and
the
resurrection
on
the
day
following
now
the
day
of
always
fell
on
the
full
moon
next
after
the
vernal
equinox
and
the
month
began
at
the
new
moon
before
not
at
the
true
conjunction
but
at
the
first
appearance
of
the
new
moon
for
the
referred
all
the
time
of
the
silent
moon
as
they
phrased
it
that
is
of
the
moon
disappearing
to
the
old
moon
and
because
the
first
appearance
might
usually
be
about
hours
after
the
true
conjunction
they
therefore
began
their
month
from
the
sixth
hour
at
evening
that
is
at
sun
set
next
after
the
eighteenth
hour
from
the
conjunction
and
this
rule
they
called
hebrew
yh
designing
by
the
letters
hebrew
y
and
hebrew
h
the
number
i
know
that
tells
us
if
some
interpret
his
words
rightly
that
the
used
a
vicious
cycle
and
thereby
anticipated
the
legal
new
moons
by
two
days
but
this
surely
he
spake
not
as
a
witness
for
he
neither
understood
nor
learning
but
as
arguing
from
his
erroneous
hypothesis
about
the
time
of
the
passion
for
the
did
not
anticipate
but
postpone
their
months
they
thought
it
lawful
to
begin
their
months
a
day
later
than
the
first
appearance
of
the
new
moon
because
the
new
moon
continued
for
more
days
than
one
but
not
a
day
sooner
lest
they
should
celebrate
the
new
moon
before
there
was
any
and
the
still
keep
a
tradition
in
their
books
that
the
used
diligently
to
define
the
new
moons
by
sight
sending
witnesses
into
mountainous
places
and
examining
them
about
the
moon
appearing
and
translating
the
new
moon
from
the
day
they
had
agreed
on
to
the
day
before
as
often
as
witnesses
came
from
distant
regions
who
had
seen
it
a
day
sooner
than
it
was
seen
at
accordingly
one
of
the
priests
who
ministred
in
the
temple
tells
us
that
the
passover
was
kept
the
day
nisan
greek
kata
selênên
to
the
moon
when
the
sun
was
in
this
is
confirmed
also
by
two
instances
recorded
by
him
which
totally
overthrow
the
hypothesis
of
the
using
a
vicious
cycle
for
that
year
in
which
was
taken
and
destroyed
he
saith
the
passover
was
on
the
day
of
the
month
which
according
to
is
our
and
that
five
years
before
it
fell
on
the
day
of
the
same
month
which
two
instances
agree
with
the
course
of
the
moon
computing
therefore
the
new
moons
of
the
first
month
according
to
the
course
of
the
moon
and
the
rule
and
thence
counting
days
i
find
that
the
day
of
this
month
in
the
year
of
fell
on
tuesday
in
the
year
on
sunday
in
the
year
on
friday
in
the
year
on
wednesday
or
rather
for
avoiding
the
equinox
which
fell
on
the
same
day
and
for
having
a
fitter
time
for
harvest
on
thursday
also
in
the
year
on
tuesday
and
in
the
year
on
saturday
but
because
the
and
days
of
and
a
day
or
two
of
and
the
and
of
were
always
sabbatical
days
or
days
of
rest
and
it
was
inconvenient
on
two
sabbaths
together
to
be
prohibited
burying
their
dead
and
making
ready
fresh
meat
for
in
that
hot
region
their
meat
would
be
apt
in
two
days
to
corrupt
to
avoid
these
and
such
like
inconveniences
the
postponed
their
months
a
day
as
often
as
the
first
day
of
the
month
or
which
is
all
one
the
third
of
the
month
was
sunday
wednesday
or
friday
and
this
rule
they
called
hebrew
by
the
letters
hebrew
w
d
signifying
the
numbers
that
is
the
and
days
of
the
week
which
days
we
call
sunday
wednesday
and
friday
postponing
therefore
by
this
rule
the
months
found
above
the
day
of
the
month
will
fall
in
the
year
of
on
wednesday
in
the
year
on
monday
in
the
year
on
friday
in
the
year
on
friday
in
the
year
on
wednesday
and
in
the
year
on
saturday
by
this
computation
therefore
the
year
is
absolutely
excluded
because
the
passion
can
not
fall
on
friday
without
making
it
five
days
after
the
full
moon
or
two
days
before
it
whereas
it
ought
to
be
upon
the
day
of
the
full
moon
or
the
next
day
for
the
same
reason
the
years
and
are
excluded
because
in
them
the
passion
can
not
fall
on
friday
without
making
it
three
days
after
the
full
moon
or
four
days
before
it
errors
so
enormous
that
they
would
be
very
conspicuous
in
the
heavens
to
every
vulgar
eye
the
year
is
contended
for
by
few
or
none
and
both
this
and
the
year
may
be
thus
excluded
in
the
beginning
of
his
reign
made
president
of
and
after
years
substituted
who
governed
years
then
newly
made
president
of
deprived
him
of
his
honour
substituting
and
at
length
sent
him
to
but
by
reason
of
delays
died
before
got
thither
in
the
mean
time
after
he
had
deposed
came
to
in
the
time
of
the
passover
to
visit
that
province
as
well
as
others
in
the
beginning
of
his
office
and
in
the
place
of
then
high
priest
created
the
son
of
or
as
he
is
called
in
scripture
afterwards
when
was
returned
to
he
received
letters
from
to
make
peace
with
king
of
the
at
the
same
time
the
by
the
sollicitation
of
invaded
the
kingdom
of
and
his
subjects
also
by
the
procurement
of
soon
after
rebelled
for
thought
that
thus
pressed
with
difficulties
would
more
readily
accept
the
conditions
of
peace
therefore
straightway
gathering
a
greater
army
opprest
the
rebels
and
then
meeting
at
made
a
league
with
the
after
this
commanded
to
make
war
upon
king
of
he
therefore
leading
his
army
against
went
together
with
to
to
sacrifice
at
the
publick
feast
which
was
then
to
be
celebrated
where
being
received
honourably
he
stayed
three
days
and
in
the
mean
while
translated
the
high
priesthood
from
to
his
brother
and
the
fourth
day
receiving
letters
of
the
death
of
made
the
people
swear
allegiance
to
the
new
emperor
and
recalling
his
army
sent
them
into
quarters
all
this
is
related
by
now
reigned
years
and
months
and
died
in
the
beginning
of
the
year
of
and
the
feast
of
the
passover
fell
on
following
that
is
days
after
the
death
of
so
that
there
were
about
or
days
for
the
news
of
his
death
to
come
from
to
at
which
being
a
convenient
time
for
that
message
confirms
that
the
feast
which
and
now
went
up
to
was
the
passover
for
had
it
been
the
pentecost
as
is
usually
supposed
would
have
continued
three
months
ignorant
of
the
emperor
death
which
is
not
to
be
supposed
however
the
things
done
between
this
feast
and
the
passover
which
was
at
before
namely
the
stirring
up
a
sedition
in
the
quieting
that
sedition
the
making
a
league
after
that
with
the
the
sending
news
of
that
league
to
the
receiving
new
orders
from
thence
to
go
against
the
and
the
putting
those
orders
in
execution
required
much
more
time
than
the
fifty
days
between
the
passover
and
pentecost
of
the
same
year
and
therefore
the
passover
which
first
went
up
to
was
in
the
year
before
therefore
was
deposed
before
the
passover
and
by
consequence
the
passion
of
was
before
that
passover
for
he
suffered
not
under
nor
under
and
together
but
under
alone
now
it
is
observable
that
the
high
priesthood
was
at
this
time
become
an
annual
office
and
the
passover
was
the
time
of
making
a
new
high
priest
for
the
predecessor
of
saith
made
high
priest
after
and
a
while
after
suppose
a
year
deposed
him
and
substituted
and
a
year
after
and
after
another
year
and
then
gave
way
to
so
at
one
passover
made
successor
to
and
at
the
next
to
hence
tells
us
that
in
the
year
of
and
were
high
priests
that
is
till
the
passover
and
afterwards
accordingly
speaks
of
the
high
priesthood
as
an
annual
office
for
he
tells
us
again
and
again
in
the
last
year
of
preaching
that
was
high
priest
for
that
year
xi
xviii
and
the
next
year
tells
you
that
was
high
priest
iv
was
therefore
made
high
priest
in
the
first
year
of
in
the
year
of
and
in
the
year
of
the
same
emperor
and
therefore
allotting
a
year
to
each
the
passion
when
succeeded
could
not
be
later
than
the
year
of
thus
there
remain
only
the
years
and
to
be
considered
and
the
year
i
exclude
by
this
argument
in
the
passover
two
years
before
the
passion
when
went
thro
the
corn
and
his
disciples
pluckt
the
ears
and
rubbed
them
with
their
hands
to
eat
this
ripeness
of
the
corn
shews
that
the
passover
then
fell
late
and
so
did
the
passover
but
the
passover
fell
very
early
it
was
not
therefore
two
years
after
the
year
but
two
years
after
that
suffered
thus
all
the
characters
of
the
passion
agree
to
the
year
and
that
is
the
only
year
to
which
they
all
agree

that
and
his
forerunner

their
parabolical
discourses

to
allude

they
would
describe
things

parables

that

wholly
to

that
he
almost
venerated

devoted

certain
that

god
to

of

profession
of
a
single
life
was
propagated
in

in

got
into

lived
first
singly
in

then
associated
into
or
convents
and
at
length
came
into
towns
and
filled
the
churches
with
bishops
presbyters
and
deacons
in
his
younger
days
poured
water
upon
the
hands
of
his
master
and
finding
the
monks
faithful
to
him
made
many
of
them
bishops
and
presbyters
in
and
these
bishops
erected
new
monasteries
out
of
which
they
chose
presbyters
of
their
own
cities
and
sent
bishops
to
others

like
was
done
in

more
readily
this
sort
of
christianity
as
having

of

by

by

illuminated
the

other
superstitions
such
as
were
the
doctrine
of
ghosts

of
their
punishment
in
purgatory
with
prayers
and
oblations
for
mitigating
that
punishment

this
came
to

by
degrees
in
the

manner
tells
us
that
after
the
persecution
of
the
emperor
bishop
of
in
among
all
people
as
an
addition
or
corollary
of
devotion
towards
god
that
festival
days
and
assemblies
should
be
celebrated
to
them
who
had
contended
for
the
that
is
to
the
and
he
adds
this
reason
for
the
institution
he
saith
the
simple
and
unskilful
multitude
by
reason
of
corporeal
delights
remained
in
the
error
of
idols
that
the
principal
thing
might
be
corrected
among
them
namely
that
instead
of
their
vain
worship
they
might
turn
their
eyes
upon
god
he
permitted
that
at
the
memories
of
the
holy
martyrs
they
might
make
merry
and
delight
themselves
and
be
dissolved
into
the
heathens
were
delighted
with
the
festivals
of
their
gods
and
unwilling
to
part
with
those
delights
and
therefore
to
facilitate
their
conversion
instituted
annual
festivals
to
the
and
hence
it
came
to
pass
that
for
exploding
the
festivals
of
the
heathens
the
principal
festivals
of
the
succeeded
in
their
room
as
the
keeping

of

to

and

of

apostles
in
the
room
of
the
solemnities
at
the
entrance
of

into
the
signs
of
the
in
the
old
calendar
in
the
same
persecution
of
ordered
the
passions
of
the
martyrs
in
to
be
registred
in
order
to
celebrate
their
memories
annually
with
oblations
and
sacrifices
and
bishop

little
after

the

of

ordained
that
sacrifices
should
be
celebrated
annually
in

name
by
the
pleasures
of
these
festivals
the
increased
much
in
number
and
decreased
as
much
in
virtue
until
they
were
and
made
by
the
persecution
of
this
was
the
first
step
made
in
the
religion
towards
the
veneration
of
the
martyrs
and
tho
it
did
not
yet
amount
to
an
unlawful
worship
yet
it
disposed
the
towards
such
a
further
veneration
of
the
dead
as
in
a
short
time
ended
in
the
invocation
of
saints
the
next
step
was
the
affecting
to
pray
at
the
sepulchres
of
the
martyrs
which
practice
began
in
persecution
the
council
of
in
celebrated
in
the
third
or
fourth
year
of
persecution

canons

presently
after
that
persecution
suppose
about
the
year
the
council
of
in
which
then
met
for
restoring
the
lapsed
discipline
of
the
church
has
the
following
canons
can
of
the
church
are
not
allowed
to
go
into
the
or
as
they
are
called
of
hereticks
for
the
sake
of
prayer
or
recovery
of
health
but
such
as
go
if
they
be
of
the
faithful
shall
be
excommunicated
for
a
can
must
not
leave
the
martyrs
of
and
go
to
false
that
is
to
the
martyrs
of
the
hereticks
these
are
alien
from
god
and
therefore
let
those
be
anathema
who
go
to
can
of
the
martyrs
shall
not
be
celebrated
in
but
their
commemoration
shall
be
made
on
the
and
lords
the
council
of
celebrated
in
the
year
made
this
canon
any
man
being
arrogant
abominates
the
congregations
of
the
martyrs
or
the
liturgies
performed
therein
or
the
memories
of
the
martyrs
let
him
be
by
all
which
it
is
manifest
that
the
in
the
time
of
persecution
used
to
pray
in
the
or
of
the
dead
for
avoiding
the
danger
of
the
persecution
and
for
want
of
churches
which
were
all
thrown
down
and
after
the
persecution
was
over
continued
that
practice
in
honour
of
the
martyrs
till
new
churches
could
be
built
and
by
use
affected
it
as
advantageous
to
devotion
and
for
recovering
the
health
of
those
that
were
sick
it
also
appears
that
in
these
they
commemorated
the
martyrs
yearly
upon
days
dedicated
to
them
and
accounted
all
these
practices
pious
and
religious
and
anathematized
those
men
as
arrogant
who
opposed
them
or
prayed
in
the
of
the
hereticks
they
also
lighted
torches
to
the
martyrs
in
the
as
the
heathens
did
to
their
gods
which
custom
before
the
end
of
the
fourth
century
prevailed
much
in
the
they
sprinkled
the
worshipers
of
the
martyrs
with
as
the
heathens
did
the
worshipers
of
their
gods
and
went
in
pilgrimage
to
see
and
other
holy
places
as
if
those
places
conferred
sanctity
on
the
visiters
from
the
custom
of
praying
in
the
and
came
the
custom
of
translating
the
bodies
of
the
saints
and
martyrs
into
such
churches
as
were
new
built
the
emperor
began
this
practice
about
the
year
causing
the
bodies
of
the
apostle
and
to
be
translated
into
a
new
church
at
and
before
this
act
of
the
kept
the
bodies
of
their
martyrs
and
saints
unburied
upon
beds
in
their
private
houses
and
told
stories
of
their
souls
appearing
after
death
and
ascending
up
to
heaven
as
relates
in
the
life
of
all
which
gave
occasion
to
the
emperor
as
relates
to
accuse
the
in
this
manner
adding
to
that
antient
dead
man
jesus
many
new
dead
men
who
can
sufficiently
abominate
you
have
filled
all
places
with
sepulchres
and
monuments
altho
you
are
no
where
bidden
to
prostrate
yourselves
to
sepulchres
and
to
respect
them
and
a
little
after
said
that
sepulchres
are
full
of
filthiness
how
do
you
invoke
god
upon
and
in
another
place
he
saith
that
if
had
adhered
to
the
precepts
of
the
would
have
worshiped
one
god
instead
of
many
and
not
a
man
or
rather
not
many
unhappy
and
that
they
the
wood
of
the
cross
making
its
images
on
their
foreheads
and
before
their
after
the
sepulchres
of
saints
and
martyrs
were
thus
converted
into
places
of
worship
like
the
heathen
temples
and
the
churches
into
sepulchres
and
a
certain
sort
of
sanctity
attributed
to
the
dead
bodies
of
the
saints
and
martyrs
buried
in
them
and
annual
festivals
were
kept
to
them
with
sacrifices
offered
to
god
in
their
name
the
next
step
towards
the
invocation
of
saints
was
the
attributing
to
their
dead
bodies
bones
and
other
reliques
a
power
of
working
miracles
by
means
of
the
separate
souls
who
were
supposed
to
know
what
we
do
or
say
and
to
be
able
to
do
us
good
or
hurt
and
to
work
those
miracles
this
was
the
very
notion
the
heathens
had
of
the
separate
souls
of
their
antient
kings
and
heroes
whom
they
worshiped
under
the
names
of
and
the
rest
of
their
gods
for
these
gods
being
male
and
female
husband
and
wife
son
and
daughter
brother
and
sister
are
thereby
discovered
to
be
antient
men
and
women
now
as
the
first
step
towards
the
invocation
of
saints
was
set
on
foot
by
the
persecution
of
and
the
second
by
the
persecution
of
so
this
third
seems
to
have
been
owing
to
the
proceedings
of
and
the
apostate
when
began
to
restore
the
worship
of
the
heathen
gods
and
to
vilify
the
saints
and
martyrs
the
of
and
seem
to
have
made
a
great
noise
about
the
miracles
done
by
the
reliques
of
the
saints
and
martyrs
in
opposition
to
the
powers
attributed
by
and
the
heathens
to
their
idols
for
and
tell
us
that
when
he
opened
the
heathen
temples
and
consulted
the
oracle
of
in
the
suburbs
of
and
pressed
by
many
sacrifices
for
an
answer
the
oracle
at
length
told
him
that
the
bones
of
the
martyr
which
were
buried
there
hinder
him
from
speaking
by
which
answer
we
may
understand
that
some
was
got
into
the
place
where
the
heathen
priests
used
to
speak
thro
a
pipe
in
delivering
their
oracles
and
before
this
in
his
book
against
written
in
the
last
year
of
that
emperor
makes
the
following
mention
of
what
was
then
doing
in
the
where
he

these

made
the
heathens
in
the
reign
of
the
same
emperor
demolish
the
sepulchre
of
the
baptist
in
and
burn
his
bones
when
several
mixing
themselves
with
the
heathens
gathered
up
some
of
his
remains
which
were
sent
to
who
hid
them
in
the
wall
of
a
church
foreseeing
by
a
prophetic
spirit
as
tells
us
that
they
might
be
profitable
to
future
generations
the
cry
of
these
miracles
being
once
set
on
foot
continued
for
many
years
and
encreased
and
grew
more
general
in
his
second
oration
on
twenty
years
after
the
silencing
of
the
oracle
of
as

saith
of
the

done
by

in

describing
how

were

of

he
adds

this
oration
was
written
at
while
was
yet
the
metropolis
of
the
that
is
before
the
year
in
which
became
the
metropolis
and
it
was
a
work
of
some
years
for
the
to
have
distributed
the
reliques
of
their
martyrs
over
all
the
world
as
they
had
done
before
that
year
abounded
most
with
the
reliques
of
saints
and
martyrs
the
keeping
them
embalmed
upon
beds
even
in
their
private
houses
and
was
eminent
above
all
other
cities
for
dispersing
them
so
as
on
that
account
to
acquire
glory
with
all
men
and
manifest
herself
to
be
the
of
the
world
followed
the
example
of
in
dispersing
the
reliques
of
the
forty
martyrs
and
the
examples
of
and
were
soon
followed
by
the
rest
of
the
world
the
reliques
of
the
forty
martyrs
at
were
distributed
among
the
churches
before
the
year
for
who
died
in
that
year
wrote
an
oration
upon
them
this
oration
is
not
yet
published
but
saw
it
in
in
the
library
of
cardinal
in
as
he
says
in
his
commentary
upon
the
oration
of
on
the
same
forty
martyrs
now
since
the
monks
of
sent
the
reliques
of
the
martyrs
of
into
all
parts
of
the
earth
and
thereby
acquired
glory
to
their
city
and
declared
her
in
these
matters
the
metropolis
of
the
whole
world
as
we
have
observed
out
of
it
may
be
concluded
that
before
received
the
forty
martyrs
from
she
began
to
send
out
the
reliques
of
her
own
martyrs
into
all
parts
setting
the
first
example
to
other
cities
this
practice
therefore
began
in
some
years
before
the
death
of
it
began
when
the
bones
of
the
baptist
were
carried
into
and
hid
in
the
wall
of
a
church
they
might
be
profitable
to
future
it
was
restrained
in
the
reign
of
the
apostate
and
then
it
spred
from
into
all
the
empire
being
the
metropolis
of
the
whole
world
according
to
for
propagating
this
sort
of
devotion
and
and
other
cities
soon
following
her
example
in
propagating
these
superstitions
the
were
the
monks
and
was
at
the
head
of
them
for
in
the
end
of
the
life
of
relates
that
these
were
his
dying
words
to
his
disciples
who
then
attended
him
you
take
said
adhere
to
in
the
first
place
and
then
to
the
saints
that
after
death
they
may
receive
you
as
friends
and
acquaintance
into
the
everlasting
tabernacles
think
upon
these
things
perceive
these
things
and
if
you
have
any
regard
to
me
remember
me
as
a
this
being
delivered
in
charge
to
the
monks
by
at
his
death
could
not
but
inflame
their
whole
body
with
devotion
towards
the
saints
as
the
ready
way
to
be
received
by
them
into
the
eternal
tabernacles
after
death
hence
came
that
noise
about
the
miracles
done
by
the
reliques
of
the
saints
in
the
time
of
hence
came
the
dispersion
of
the
reliques
into
all
the
empire
setting
the
example
and
being
renowned
for
it
above
all
other
cities
hence
it
came
to
pass
in
the
days
of
that
by
a
prophetic
spirit
as
tells
us
hid
the
bones
of
the
baptist
from
the
heathens
not
in
the
ground
to
be
forgotten
but
in
the
hollow
wall
of
a
church
before
proper
witnesses
that
they
might
profitable
to
future
hence
also
came
the
invocation
of
the
saints
for
doing
such
miracles
and
for
assisting
men
in
their
devotions
and
mediating
with
god
for
even
from
his
youth
looked
upon
the
dead
saints
and
martyrs
as
mediators
of
our
prayers
in
his
epistle
to
written
in
the
days
of
the
great
he
saith
that
the
words
of
the
are
not
to
be
transposed
or
any
wise
changed
but
to
be
recited
and
sung
without
any
artifice
as
they
are
written
the
holy
men
who
delivered
them
knowing
them
to
be
their
own
words
may
pray
with
us
or
rather
that
the
holy
ghost
who
spake
in
the
holy
men
seeing
his
own
words
with
which
he
inspired
them
may
with
them
assisting
whilst
abounded
with
monks
above
any
other
country
the
veneration
of
the
saints
began
sooner
and
spred
faster
there
than
in
other
places
going
into
in
the
year
to
visit
the
monasteries
and
the
sepulchres
of
and
other
martyrs
of
who
had
suffered
under

of
them

also
a
heathen
yet
a
competent
witness
of
what
was
done
in
his
own
times
relating
how
the
soldiers
delivered
the
temples
of
into
the
hands
of
the
monks

was
done
in
the

thus
in
an

by
these
instances
we
may
understand
the
invocation
of
saints
was
now
of
some
standing
in
and
that
it
was
already
generally
received
and
practised
there
by
the
common
people
thus
a
monk
who
was
made
bishop
of
in
the
year
and
died
in
the
year
in
his
oration
on
the
martyr
saith
ye
mindful
of
the
martyr
as
many
of
you
as
have
enjoyed
him
in
your
dreams
as
many
as
in
this
place
have
been
assisted
by
him
in
prayer
as
many
of
you
as
upon
invoking
him
by
name
have
had
him
present
in
your
works
as
many
as
he
has
reduced
into
the
way
from
wandering
as
many
as
he
has
restored
to
health
as
many
as
have
had
their
dead
children
restored
by
him
to
life
as
many
as
have
had
their
lives
prolonged
by
and
a
little
after
he
thus
expresses
the
universality
of
this
superstition
in
the
regions
of
and
the
memory
of
the
saith
he
whole
region
is
moved
at
his
festival
the
whole
city
is
transported
with
joy
nor
do
the
kindred
of
the
rich
turn
aside
to
the
sepulchres
of
their
ancestors
but
all
go
to
the
place
of
again
in
the
end
of
the
homily
he
prays
that
would
preserve
the
church
thus
fortified
with
the
great
towers
of
the
and
in
his
oration
on
the
forty
martyrs
are
saith
he
obtaining
our
country
like
certain
towers
afford
us
safety
against
our
enemies
neither
are
they
shut
up
in
one
place
only
but
being
distributed
are
sent
into
many
regions
and
adorn

you
have
often
endeavoured
you
have
often

of

suffragans
and
coadjutors
of
our
prayers
most
powerful
embassadors
to
by
all
which
it
is
manifest
that
before
the
year
the
orations
and
sermons
upon
the
saints
went
much
beyond
the
bounds
of
mere
oratorical
flourishes
and
that
the
common
people
in
the
were
already
generally
corrupted
by
the
monks
with
a
monk
in
his
sixth
oration
written
when
he
was
newly
made
bishop
of
saith
us
purify
ourselves
to
the
martyrs
or
rather
to
the
god
of
the
and
a
little
after
he
calls
the
martyrs
of
obtaining
an
ascension
or
the
same
year
in
the
end
of
his
oration
upon
then
newly
dead
he
thus
invokes
him
thou
look
down
upon
us
propitiously
and
govern
this
people
as
perfect
adorers
of
the
perfect
trinity
which
in
the
father
son
and
holy
ghost
is
contemplated
and
worshiped
if
there
shall
be
peace
preserve
me
and
feed
my
flock
with
me
but
if
war
bring
me
home
place
me
by
thyself
and
by
those
that
are
like
thee
however
great
my
and
in
the
end
of
the
funeral
oration
upon
written
he
thus
addresses
him
thou
o
divine
and
sacred
head
look
down
upon
us
from
heaven
and
by
thy
prayers
either
take
away
that
thorn
of
the
flesh
which
is
given
us
by
god
for
exercise
or
obtain
that
we
may
bear
it
with
courage
and
direct
all
our
life
to
that
which
is
most
fitting
for
us
when
we
depart
this
life
receive
us
there
in
your
tabernacles
that
living
together
and
beholding
the
holy
and
blessed
trinity
more
purely
and
perfectly
whereof
we
have
now
but
an
imperfect
view
we
may
there
come
to
the
end
of
our
desires
and
receive
this
reward
of
the
wars
which
we
have
waged
or
and
in
his
oration
upon
not
the
bishop
of
but
a
he
invokes
him
after
the
same
manner
and
tells
us
also
how
a
pious
virgin
named
was
protected
by
invoking
the
virgin
and
how
miracles
were
done
by
the
ashes
of
another
eminent
monk
and
bishop
in
the
life
of
tells
how
a
certain
man
returning
from
a
far
country
was
in
great
danger
by
reason
all
the
ways
were
intercepted
by
the
armies
of
barbarous
nations
but
upon
invoking
by
name
and
saying
assist
he
escaped
the
danger
neglected
the
fear
of
death
and
beyond
his
hope
got
safe
home
in
the
end
of
this
oration
calls
upon
after
the
following
manner
thou
o
ephræm
assisting
now
at
the
divine
altar
and
sacrificing
to
the
prince
of
life
and
to
the
most
holy
trinity
together
with
the
angels
remember
us
all
and
obtain
for
us
pardon
of
our
sins
that
we
may
enjoy
the
eternal
happiness
of
the
kingdom
of
the
same
in
his
oration
on
the
martyr
written
thus
describes
the
power
of
that
martyr
and
the
practice
of
the
people
saith
he
last
year
quieted
the
barbarous
tempest
and
put
a
stop
to
the
horrid
war
of
the
fierce
and
cruel
if
any
one
is
permitted
to
carry
away
the
dust
with
which
the
tomb
is
covered
wherein
the
body
of
the
martyr
rests
the
dust
is
accepted
as
a
gift
and
gathered
to
be
laid
up
as
a
thing
of
great
price
for
to
touch
the
reliques
themselves
if
any
such
prosperous
fortune
shall
at
any
time
happen
how
great
a
favour
that
is
and
not
to
be
obtained
without
the
most
earnest
prayers
they
know
well
who
have
obtained
it
for
as
a
living
and
florid
body
they
who
behold
it
embrace
it
applying
to
it
the
eyes
mouth
ears
and
all
the
organs
of
sense
and
then
with
affection
pouring
tears
upon
the
martyr
as
if
he
was
whole
and
appeared
to
them
they
offer
prayers
with
supplication
that
he
would
intercede
for
them
as
an
advocate
praying
to
him
as
an
officer
attending
upon
god
and
invoking
him
as
receiving
gifts
whenever
he
at
length
concludes
the
oration
with
this
prayer
theodorus
we
want
many
blessings
intercede
and
beseech
for
thy
country
before
the
common
king
and
lord
for
the
country
of
the
martyr
is
the
place
of
his
passion
and
they
are
his
citizens
brethren
and
kindred
who
have
him
defend
adorn
and
honour
him
we
fear
afflictions
we
expect
dangers
the

preached

professed
what
the

him
after
this
manner
for

a

and
recal
me
by
thy

treasured
up
a
treasure
of
all
virtues
be
a
guide
to
me
who
am
empty
of
every
good
in
the
beginning
of
his
encomium
upon
the
forty
martyrs
written
at
the

time
he
thus
invokes
them
me
therefore
o
ye
saints
with
your
intercession
and
o
ye
beloved
with
your
holy
prayers
that
by
his
grace
may
direct
my
tongue
to
and
afterwards
mentioning
the
mother
of
one
of
these
forty
martyrs
he
concludes
the
oration
with
this
prayer
entreat
thee
o
holy
faithful
and
blessed
woman
pray
for
me
to
the
saints
saying
intercede
ye
that
triumph
in
for
the
most
little
and
miserable
that
he
may
find
mercy
and
by
the
grace
of
may
be
again
in
his
second
sermon
or

on
the
praises
of

thus
addresses
them
entreat
you
most
holy
martyrs
to
intercede
with
the
lord
for
us
miserable
sinners
beset
with
the
filthiness
of
negligence
that
he
would
infuse
his
divine
grace
into
and
afterwards
near
the
end
of
the
same
discourse
ye
most
holy
men
and
glorious
martyrs
of
god
help
me
a
miserable
sinner
with
your
prayers
that
in
that
dreadful
hour
i
may
obtain
mercy
when
the
secrets
of
all
hearts
shall
be
made
manifest
i
am
to
day
become
to
you
most
holy
martyrs
of
as
it
were
an
unprofitable
and
unskilful
for
i
have
delivered
to
the
sons
and
brothers
of
your
faith
a
cup
of
the
excellent
wine
of
your
warfare
with
the
excellent
table
of
your
victory
replenished
with
all
sorts
of
dainties
i
have
endeavoured
with
the
whole
affection
and
desire
of
my
mind
to
recreate
your
fathers
and
brothers
kindred
and
relations
who
daily
frequent
the
table
for
behold
they
sing
and
with
exultation
and
jubilee
glorify
god
who
has
crown
your
virtues
by
setting
on
your
most
sacred
heads
incorruptible
and
celestial
crowns
they
with
excessive
joy
stand
about
the
sacred
reliques
of
your
martyrdoms
wishing
for
a
blessing
and
desiring
to
bear
away
holy
medicines
both
for
the
body
and
the
mind
as
good
disciples
and
faithful
ministers
of
our
benign
lord
and
saviour
bestow
therefore
a
blessing
on
them
all
and
on
me
also
tho
weak
and
feeble
who
having
received
strength
by
your
merits
and
intercessions
have
with
the
whole
devotion
of
my
mind
sung
a
hymn
to
your
praise
and
glory
before
your
holy
reliques
wherefore
i
beseech
you
stand
before
the
throne
of
the
divine
majesty
for
me
a
vile
and
miserable
sinner
that
by
your
prayers
i
may
deserve
to
obtain
salvation
and
with
you
enjoy
eternal
felicity
by
the
grace
and
benignity
and
mercy
of
our
lord
and
saviour
to
whom
with
the
father
and
holy
ghost
be
praise
honour
and
glory
for
ever
and
amen
by
what
has
been
cited
out
of
the
two
and
we
may
understand
that
was
established
among
the
monks
and
their
admirers
in
and
before
the
year
this
being
the
year
in
which
and
died
was
not
much
later
he
preached
at
almost
all
the
time
of
the
great
and
in
his
sermons
are
many
exhortations
to
this
sort
of
superstition
as
may
be
seen
in
the
end
of
his
orations
on
on
on
the
martyr
on
the
martyrs
on
fate
and
providence
on
the
martyrs
in
general
on
and
on
and
on
the
name
of
thus
in
his
sermon
on
and
saith
he
are
inflamed
with
no
small
love
towards
these
martyrs
therefore
with
this
ardour
let
us
fall
down
before
their
reliques
let
us
embrace
their
coffins
for
the
coffins
of
the
martyrs
have
great
virtue
even
as
the
bones
of
the
martyrs
have
great
power
nor
let
us
only
on
the
day
of
this
festival
but
also
on
other
days
apply
to
them
invoke
them
and
beseech
them
to
be
our
patrons
for
they
have
great
power
and
efficacy
not
only
whilst
alive
but
also
after
death
and
much
more
after
death
than
before
for
now
they
bear
the
marks
or
brands
of
and
when
they
shew
these
marks
they
can
obtain
all
things
of
the
king
seeing
therefore
they
abound
with
such
efficacy
and
have
so
much
friendship
with
him
we
also
when
by
continual
attendance
and
perpetual
visitation
of
them
we
have
insinuated
ourselves
into
their
familiarity
may
by
their
assistance
obtain
the
mercy
of
was
free
from
these
superstitions
till
came
thither
but
in
a
few
years
it
was
also
inflamed
with
it
tells
us
that
when
the
emperor
was
setting
out
against
the
tyrant
which
was
in
the
year
he
went
about
with
the
priests
and
people
to
all
the
places
of
prayer
lay
prostrate
in
haircloth
before
the
shrines
of
the
martyrs
and
apostles
and
pray
for
assistance
by
the
intercession
of
the
saints
adds
that
when
the
emperor
was
marched
seven
miles
from
against
he
went
into
a
church
which
he
had
built
to
the
baptist
invoked
the
baptist
for
his
assistance
says
that
is
clothed
in
purple
approaches
to
embrace
these
sepulchres
and
laying
aside
his
dignity
stands
supplicating
the
saints
to
intercede
for
him
with
god
and
he
who
goes
crowned
with
a
diadem
offers
his
prayers
to
the
and
the
as
his
and
in
another
place
cities
run
together
to
the
sepulchres
of
the
martyrs
and
the
people
are
inflamed
with
the
love
of
this
practice
of
sending
reliques
from
place
to
place
for
working
miracles
and
thereby
inflaming
the
devotion
of
the
nations
towards
the
dead
saints
and
their
reliques
and
setting
up
the
religion
of
invoking
their
souls
lasted
only
till
the
middle
of
the
reign
of
the
emperor
the
great
for
he
then
prohibited
it
by
the
following
edict

then

also
postponed
the

of

sacred
books
and
was
to
place
the
after
them
he
might
perhaps
have
heard
from
his

that
he
had
received
this
book
from
about
the
time
of
death
or
indeed
might
himself
at
that

have
made
a
new
publication
of
it
from
whence
might
imagine
it
was
then
but
newly
written
in
his
and
follows
but
afterwards
in
his
he
conjoins
the
banishment
of
into
with
the
deaths
of
and
and
so
do
and
as
well
as
the
first
author
whoever
he
was
of
that
very
antient
fable
that
was
put
by
into
a
vessel
of
hot
oil
and
coming
out
unhurt
was
banished
by
him
into
tho
this
story
be
no
more
than
a
fiction
yet
was
it
founded
on
a
tradition
of
the
first
churches
that
was
banished
into
in
the
days
of
represents
the
of
as
written
in
the
time
of
and
the
even
before
that
of
in
the
beginning
of
his
commentary
quotes
the
opinion
of
from
but
follows
it
not
for
he
afterwards
affirms
the
was
written
before
the
destruction
of
and
that
former
commentators
had
expounded
the
sixth
seal
of
that
destruction
with
the
opinion
of
the
first
commentators
agrees
the
tradition
of
the
churches
of
preserved
to
this
day
in
the
title
of
the
version
of
the
which
title
is
this
revelation
which
was
made
to
the
evangelist
by
god
in
the
island
into
which
he
was
banished
by
the
the
fame
is
confirmed
by
a
story
told
by
out
of
and
other
antient
authors
concerning
a
youth
whom
some
time
after
his
return
from
committed
to
the
care
of
the
bishop
of
a
certain
city
the
bishop
educated
instructed
and
at
length
baptized
him
but
then
remitting
of
his
care
the
young
man
thereupon
got
into
ill
company
and
began
by
degrees
first
to
revel
and
grow
vitious
then
to
abuse
and
spoil
those
he
met
in
the
night
and
at
last
grew
so
desperate
that
his
companions
turning
a
band
of
men
made
him
their
captain
and
saith
he
continued
their
captain
a
long
time
at
length
returning
to
that
city
and
hearing
what
was
done
rode
to
the
thief
and
when
he
out
of
reverence
to
his
old
master
fled
rode
after
him
recalled
him
and
restored
him
to
the
church
this
is
a
story
of
many
years
and
requires
that
should
have
returned
from
rather
at
the
death
of
than
at
that
of
because
between
the
death
of
and
that
of
there
were
but
two
years
and
an
half
and
in
his
old
age
was
so
infirm
as
to
be
carried
to
church
dying
above
years
old
and
therefore
could
not
be
then
suppos
able
to
ride
after
the
thief
this
opinion
is
further
supported
by
the
allusions
in
the
to
the
temple
and
altar
and
holy
city
as
then
standing
and
to
the
who
were
soon
after
to
tread
under
foot
the
holy
city
and
outward
court
is
confirmed
also
by
the
style
of
the
itself
which
is
fuller
of
than
his
gospel
for
thence
it
may
be
gathered
that
it
was
written
when
was
newly
come
out
of
where
he
had
been
used
to
the
tongue
and
that
he
did
not
write
his
gospel
till
by
long
converse
with
the
greeks
he
had
left
off
most
of
the
it
is
confirmed
also
by
the
many
false
as
those
of
and
written
in
imitation
of
the
true
one
for
as
the
many
false
gospels
false
acts
and
false
epistles
were
occasioned
by
true
ones
and
the
writing
many
false
and
ascribing
them
to
apostles
and
prophets
argues
that
there
was
a
true
apostolic
one
in
great
request
with
the
first
so
this
true
one
may
well
be
suppos
to
have
been
written
early
that
there
may
be
room
in
the
apostolic
age
for
the
writing
of
so
many
false
ones
afterwards
and
fathering
them
upon
and
others
who
were
dead
before
who
was
contemporary
with
tells
us
that
wrote
his
revelations
as
a
great
apostle
and
pretended
the
visions
were
shewn
him
by
angels
asserting
a
of
carnal
pleasures
at
after
the
resurrection
so
that
his
was
plainly
written
in
imitation
of
and
yet
he
lived
so
early
that
he
resisted
the
apostles
at
in
or
before
the
first
year
of
that
is
years
before
the
death
of
and
died
before
these
reasons
may
suffice
for
determining
the
time
and
yet
there
is
one
more
which
to
considering
men
may
seem
a
good
reason
to
others
not
propound
it
and
leave
it
to
every
man
judgment

seems
to
be
alluded
to
in
the
epistles

and

are
indeed
obscurer

but
the
second
epistle
from
the
verse
of
the
first
chapter
to
the
end
seems
to
be
a
continued
commentary
upon
the
there
in
writing
to
the
in
to
whom
was
commanded
to
send
this
prophecy
he
tells
them
they
a
more
sure
word
of
to
be
heeded
by
them
a
light
that
shineth
in
a
dark
place
until
the
day
dawn
and
the
arise
in
their
that
is
until
they
begin
to
understand
it
for
saith
he
the
scripture
is
of
any
private
interpretation
the
prophecy
came
not
in
old
time
by
the
will
of
man
but
holy
men
of
god
spake
as
they
were
moved
by
the
holy
ghost
himself
professes
that
he
understood
not
his
own
and
therefore
the
churches
were
not
to
expect
the
interpretation
from
their
prophet
but
to
study
the
prophecies
themselves
this
is
the
substance
of
what
says
in
the
first
chapter
and
then
in
the
second
he
proceeds
to
describe
out
of
this
word
of
how
there
should
arise
in
the
church
or
expressed
collectively
in
the
by
the
name
of
the
false
prophet
who
should
in
damnable
heresies
even
denying
the
lord
that
bought
which
is
the
character
of
saith
he
follow
their
they
that
dwell
on
the
earth
shall
be
deceived
by
the
false
prophet
and
be
made
drunk
with
the
wine
of
the
whore
fornication
reason
of
whom
the
way
of
truth
shall
be
for
the

is
full
of
blasphemy
covetousness
shall
they
with
feigned
words
make
merchandize
of
for
these

the
merchants
of
the
earth
who
trade
with
the
great
whore
and
their
merchandize
is
all
things
of
price
with
the
bodies
and
souls
of
men
judgment
lingreth
not
and
their
damnation
slumbreth
but
shall
surely
come
upon
them
at
the
last
day
suddenly
as
the
flood
upon
old
and
fire
and
brimstone
upon
and
when
the
just
shall
be
delivered

how
to

the
lust
of
being

the
wine

natural
brute

or
false
prophet

in
the
lake
of

the
things
they
understand
they
count
it
pleasure
to
riot
in
the
sporting

with
their
own
deceivings

they
feast
with
you
eyes
full
of
an

deliciously

the
great
whore

nations

with
the
wine
of
her
fornication

gone
astray
following
the
way
of
the
son
of
who
loved
the
wages
of
the
false
prophet
who
taught
to
cast
a
before
the
children
of
not
fountains
of
living
water
but
without
not
such
clouds
of
saints
as
the
two
witnesses
ascend
in
but
that
are
carried
with
a
thus
does
the
author
of
this
epistle
spend
all
the
second
chapter
in
describing
the
qualities
of
the
beasts
and
false
prophet
and
then
in
the
third
he
goes
on
to
describe
their
destruction
more
fully
and
the
future
kingdom
he
saith
that
because
the
coming
of
should
be
long
deferred
they
should
scoff
saying
is
the
promise
of
his
then
he
describes
the
sudden
coming
of
the
day
of
the
lord
upon
them
a
thief
in
the
which
is
the
phrase
and
the
or
which
with
god
but
as
a
the
away
of
the
old
and
earth
by
a
conflagration
in
the
lake
of
fire
and
our
for
new
heavens
and
a
new
earth
wherein
dwelleth
seeing
therefore
and
were
apostles
of
the
circumcision
it
seems
to
me
that
they
staid
with
their
churches
in
and
till
the
made
war
upon
their
nation
that
is
till
the
twelfth
year
of
that
they
then
followed
the
main
body
of
their
flying
churches
into
and
that
went
thence
by
to
that
the
empire
looked
upon
those
churches
as
enemies
because
by
birth
and
therefore
to
prevent
insurrections
secured
their
leaders
and
banished
into
it
seems
also
probable
to
me
that
the
was
there
composed
and
that
soon
after
the
epistle
to
the
and
those
of
were
written
to
these
churches
with
reference
to
this
prophecy
as
what
they
were
particularly
concerned
in
for
it
appears
by
these
epistles
that
they
were
written
in
times
of
general
affliction
and
tribulation
under
the
heathens
and
by
consequence
when
the
empire
made
war
upon
the
for
till
then
the
heathens
were
at
peace
with
the
as
well
as
with
the
rest
the
epistle
to
the
since
it
mentions
as
related
to
those
must
be
written
to
them
after
their
flight
into
where
was
bishop
and
by
consequence
after
the
war
began
the
in
being
strangers
to
seems
also
to
call
as
well
with
respect
to
the
war
made
upon
and
the
approaching
captivity
like
that
under
old
as
with
respect
to
that
name
in
the
and
in
writing
the
strangers
scattered
and
he
seems
to
intimate
that
they
were
the
strangers
newly
scattered
by
the
wars
for
those
were
the
only
strangers
there
belonging
to
his
care
this
account
of
things
agrees
best
with
history
when
duly
rectified
for
and
say
that
came
to
in
the
reign
of
and
exercised
juggling
tricks
there
adds
that
he
endeavoured
there
to
fly
but
broke
his
neck
thro
the
prayers
of
whence
or
rather
his
interpolator
has
recorded
that
came
to
in
the
second
year
of
but
bishop
of
and
place
this
victory
of
in
the
time
of
indeed
the
antienter
tradition
was
that
came
to
in
the
days
of
this
emperor
as
may
be
seen
in
tells
us
that
the
apostles
continued
long
in
and
that
then
being
driven
out
by
the
they
went
to
the
this
dispersion
was
in
the
first
year
of
the
war
when
the
as
tells
us
began
to
be
tumultuous
and
violent
in
all
places
for
all
agree
that
the
apostles
were
dispersed
into
several
regions
at
once
and
has
set
down
the
time
telling
us
that
in
the
beginning
of
the
war
the
apostles
and
disciples
of
our
lord
were
scattered
into
all
nations
into
into
into
and
first
into
where
he
preacht
to
the
dispersion
and
thence
into
saith
that
went
from
by
to
and
all
antiquity
agrees
that
and
were
martyred
there
in
the
end
of
reign
went
with
to
iv
iv
was
assistant
and
by
the
companions
of
mentioned
in
his
first
epistle
we
may
know
that
he
wrote
from
and
the
antients
generally
agree
that
in
this
epistle
he
understood
by
his
second
epistle
was
writ
to
the
same
dispersed
strangers
with
the
first
iii
and
therein
he
saith
that
had
writ
of
the
same
things
to
them
and
also
in
his
other
epistles
now
as
there
is
no
epistle
of
to
these
strangers
besides
that
to
the
so
in
this
epistle
chap
x
we
find
at
large
all
those
things
which
had
been
speaking
of
and
here
refers
to
particularly
the
away
of
the
old
heavens
and
and
an
inheritance
with
an
exhortation
to
grace
because
to
the
wicked
a
consuming
heb
xii
having
determined
the
time
of
writing
the
i
need
not
say
much
about
the
truth
of
it
since
it
was
in
such
request
with
the
first
ages
that
many
endeavoured
to
imitate
it
by
feigning
under
the
apostles
names
and
the
apostles
themselves
as
i
have
just
now
shewed
studied
it
and
used
its
phrases
by
which
means
the
style
of
the
epistle
to
the
became
more
mystical
than
that
of
other
epistles
and
the
style
of
gospel
more
figurative
and
majestical
than
that
of
the
other
gospels
i
do
not
apprehend
that
was
called
the
word
of
god
in
any
book
of
the
new
testament
written
before
the
and
therefore
am
of
opinion
the
language
was
taken
from
this
prophecy
as
were
also
many
other
phrases
in
this
gospel
such
as
those
of
being
light
which
enlightens
the
world
the
lamb
of
god
which
taketh
away
the
sins
of
the
world
the
bridegroom
he
that
testifieth
he
that
came
down
from
heaven
the
son
of
who
within
thirty
years
after
death
became
a
writes
expresly
that
certain
man
among
the
whose
name
was
one
of
the
twelve
apostles
of
in
the
revelation
which
was
shewed
him
prophesied
that
those
who
believed
in
should
live
a
thousand
years
at
and
a
few
lines
before
he
saith
i
and
as
many
as
are
in
all
things
right
in
their
opinions
believe
both
that
there
shall
be
a
resurrection
of
the
flesh
and
a
thousand
years
life
at
built
adorned
and
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
all
true
in
that
early
age
received
this
prophecy
for
in
all
ages
as
many
as
believed
the
thousand
years
received
the
as
the
foundation
of
their
opinion
and
i
do
not
know
one
instance
to
the
contrary
bishop
of
a
man
of
the
apostolic
age
and
one
of
own
disciples
did
not
only
teach
the
doctrine
of
the
thousand
years
but
also
asserted
the
as
written
by
divine
inspiration
who
flourished
next
after
wrote
a
commentary
upon
this
prophecy
and
he
being
bishop
of
one
of
the
seven
churches
could
neither
be
ignorant
of
their
tradition
about
it
nor
impose
upon
them
who
was
contemporary
with
wrote
much
upon
it
and
said
that
number
was
in
all
the
antient
and
approved
copies
and
that
he
had
it
also
confirmed
to
him
by
those
who
had
seen
face
to
meaning
no
doubt
his
master
for
one
at
the
same
time
bishop
of
asserted
it
and
so
did
and
soon
after
and
their
contemporary
the
martyr
metropolitan
of
the
wrote
a
commentary
upon
it
all
these
were
antient
men
flourishing
within
a
hundred
and
twenty
years
after
death
and
of
greatest
note
in
the
churches
of
those
times
soon
after
did
write
another
commentary
upon
it
and
he
lived
in
the
time
of
this
may
surely
suffice
to
shew
how
the
was
received
and
studied
in
the
first
ages
and
i
do
not
indeed
find
any
other
book
of
the
new
testament
so
strongly
attested
or
commented
upon
so
early
as
this
the
prophecy
said
is
he
that
readeth
and
they
that
hear
the
words
of
this
prophecy
and
keep
the
things
which
are
written
this
animated
the
first
to
study
it
so
much
till
the
difficulty
made
them
remit
and
comment
more
upon
the
other
books
of
the
new
testament
this
was
the
state
of
the
till
the
thousand
years
being
misunderstood
brought
a
prejudice
against
it
and
of
noting
how
it
abounded
with
barbarisms
that
is
with
promoted
that
prejudice
so
far
as
to
cause
many
in
the
fourth
century
to
doubt
of
the
book
but
whilst
the
and
a
great
part
of
the
always
retained
the
and
the
rest
doubted
only
out
of
prejudice
it
makes
nothing
against
its
authority
this
prophecy
is
called
with
respect
to
scripture
of
which
was
commanded
to
up
and
seal
till
the
time
of
the
sealed
it
the
time
of
the
and
until
that
time
comes
the
lamb
is
opening
the
seals
and
afterwards
the
two
witnesses
prophesy
out
of
it
a
long
time
in
before
they
ascend
up
to
heaven
in
a
cloud
all
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
these
prophecies
of
and
should
not
be
understood
till
the
time
of
the
end
but
then
some
should
prophesy
out
of
them
in
an
afflicted
and
mournful
state
for
a
long
time
and
that
but
darkly
so
as
to
convert
but
few
but
in
the
very
end
the
prophecy
should
be
so
far
interpreted
as
to
convince
many
saith
many
shall
run
to
and
fro
and
knowledge
shall
be
for
the
gospel
must
be
preached
in
all
nations
before
the
great
tribulation
and
end
of
the
world
the
multitude
which
come
out
of
this
great
tribulation
can
not
be
innumerable
out
of
all
nations
unless
they
be
made
so
by
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
before
it
comes
there
must
be
a
stone
cut
out
of
a
mountain
without
hands
before
it
can
fall
upon
the
toes
of
the
image
and
become
a
great
mountain
and
fill
the
earth
an
angel
must
fly
thro
the
midst
of
heaven
with
the
everlasting
gospel
to
preach
to
all
nations
before
falls
and
the
son
of
man
reaps
his
harvest
the
two
prophets
must
ascend
up
to
heaven
in
a
cloud
before
the
kingdoms
of
this
world
become
the
kingdoms
of
is
therefore
a
part
of
this
prophecy
that
it
should
not
be
understood
before
the
last
age
of
the
world
and
therefore
it
makes
for
the
credit
of
the
prophecy
that
it
is
not
yet
understood
but
if
the
last
age
the
age
of
opening
these
things
be
now
approaching
as
by
the
great
successes
of
late
interpreters
it
seems
to
be
we
have
more
encouragement
than
ever
to
look
into
these
things
if
the
general
preaching
of
the
gospel
be
approaching
it
is
to
us
and
our
posterity
that
those
words
mainly
belong
the
time
of
the
end
the
wise
shall
understand
but
none
of
the
wicked
shall
understand
blessed
is
he
that
readeth
and
they
that
hear
the
words
of
this
prophecy
and
keep
those
things
which
are
written
the
folly
of
interpreters
has
been
to
foretel
times
and
things
by
this
prophecy
as
if
god
designed
to
make
them
prophets
by
this
rashness
they
have
not
only
exposed
themselves
but
brought
the
prophecy
also
into
contempt
the
design
of
god
was
much
otherwise
he
gave
this
and
the
prophecies
of
the
old
testament
not
to
gratify
men
curiosities
by
enabling
them
to
foreknow
things
but
that
after
they
were
fulfilled
they
might
be
interpreted
by
the
event
and
his
own
providence
not
the
interpreters
be
then
manifested
thereby
to
the
world
for
the
event
of
things
predicted
many
ages
before
will
then
be
a
convincing
argument
that
the
world
is
governed
by
providence
for
as
the
few
and
obscure
prophecies
concerning
first
coming
were
for
setting
up
the
religion
which
all
nations
have
since
corrupted
so
the
many
and
clear
prophecies
concerning
the
things
to
be
done
at
second
coming
are
not
only
for
predicting
but
also
for
effecting
a
recovery
and
of
the
truth
and
setting
up
a
kingdom
wherein
dwells
righteousness
the
event
will
prove
the
and
this
prophecy
thus
proved
and
understood
will
open
the
old
prophets
and
all
together
will
make
known
the
true
religion
and
establish
it
for
he
that
will
understand
the
old
prophets
must
begin
with
this
but
the
time
is
not
yet
come
for
understanding
them
perfectly
because
the
main
revolution
predicted
in
them
is
not
yet
come
to
pass
the
days
of
the
voice
of
the
seventh
angel
when
he
shall
begin
to
sound
the
mystery
of
god
shall
be
finished
as
he
hath
declared
to
his
servants
the
and
then
kingdoms
of
this
world
shall
become
the
kingdoms
of
our
lord
and
his
and
he
shall
reign
for
apoc
x
xi
there
is
already
so
much
of
the
prophecy
fulfilled
that
as
many
as
will
take
pains
in
this
study
may
see
sufficient
instances
of
god
providence
but
then
the
signal
revolutions
predicted
by
all
the
holy
prophets
will
at
once
both
turn
mens
eyes
upon
considering
the
predictions
and
plainly
interpret
them
till
then
we
must
content
ourselves
with
interpreting
what
hath
been

there
is

of

who

the
relation
which
the
of
hath
to
the
book
of
the
law
of
and
to
the
worship
of
god
in
the
the
of
is
written
in
the
same
style
and
language
with
the
prophecies
of
and
hath
the
same
relation
to
them
which
they
have
to
one
another
so
that
all
of
them
together
make
but
one
complete
prophecy
and
in
like
manner
it
consists
of
two
parts
an
introductory
prophecy
and
an
interpretation
thereof
the
prophecy
is
distinguish
into
seven
successive
parts
by
the
opening
of
the
seven
seals
of
the
book
which
was
commanded
to
seal
up
and
hence
it
is
called
the
or
of
the
time
of
the
seventh
seal
is
into
eight
successive
parts
by
the
silence
in
heaven
for
half
an
hour
and
the
sounding
of
seven
trumpets
successively
and
the
seventh
trumpet
sounds
to
the
battle
of
the
great
day
of
god
almighty
whereby
kingdoms
of
this
world
become
the
kingdoms
of
the
lord
and
of
his
and
those
are
destroyed
that
destroyed
the
earth
the
interpretation
begins
with
the
words
the
temple
of
god
was
opened
in
heaven
and
there
was
seen
in
his
temple
the
ark
of
his
and
it
continues
to
the
end
of
the
prophecy
the
temple
is
the
scene
of
the
visions
and
the
visions
in
the
temple
relate
to
the
feast
of
the
seventh
month
for
the
feasts
of
the
were
typical
of
things
to
come
the
passover
related
to
the
first
coming
of
and
the
feasts
of
the
seventh
month
to
his
second
coming
his
first
coming
being
therefore
over
before
this
prophecy
was
given
the
feasts
of
the
seventh
month
are
here
only
alluded
unto
on
the
first
day
of
that
month
in
the
morning
the
dressed
the
lamps
and
in
allusion
hereunto
this
prophecy
begins
with
a
vision
of
one
like
son
of
in
the
habit
appearing
as
it
were
in
the
midst
of
the
seven
golden
candlesticks
or
over
against
the
midst
of
them
dressing
the
lamps
which
appeared
like
a
rod
of
seven
stars
in
his
right
hand
and
this
dressing
was
perform
by
the
sending
seven
epistles
to
the
angels
or
bishops
of
the
seven
churches
of
which
in
the
primitive
times
illuminated
the
temple
or
church
catholick
these
epistles
contain
admonitions
against
the
approaching
apostacy
and
therefore
relate
to
the
times
when
the
apostacy
began
to
work
strongly
and
before
it
prevailed
it
began
to
work
in
the
apostles
days
and
was
to
continue
working
the
man
of
sin
should
be
it
began
to
work
in
the
disciples
of
and
such
sorts
of
men
as
had
imbibed
the
metaphysical
philosophy
of
the
and
and
were
thence
called
calls
them
saying
that
in
his
days
there
were
many
but
these
being
condemned
by
the
apostles
and
their
immediate
disciples
put
the
churches
in
no
danger
during
the
opening
of
the
first
four
seals
the
visions
at
the
opening
of
these
seals
relate
only
to
the
civil
affairs
of
the
heathen
empire
so
long
the
apostolic
traditions
prevailed
and
preserved
the
church
in
its
purity
and
therefore
the
affairs
of
the
church
do
not
begin
to
be
considered
in
this
prophecy
before
the
opening
of
the
fifth
seal
she
began
then
to
decline
and
to
want
admonitions
and
therefore
is
admonished
by
these
epistles
till
the
apostacy
prevailed
and
took
place
which
was
at
the
opening
of
the
seventh
seal
the
admonitions
therefore
in
these
seven
epistles
relate
to
the
state
of
the
church
in
the
times
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
seals
at
the
opening
of
the
fifth
seal
the
church
is
purged
from
hypocrites
by
a
great
persecution
at
the
opening
of
the
sixth
that
which
letted
is
taken
out
of
the
way
namely
the
heathen
empire
at
the
opening
of
the
seventh
the
man
of
sin
is
revealed
and
to
these
times
the
seven
epistles
relate
the
seven
angels
to
whom
these
epistles
were
written
answer
to
the
seven
who
were
priests
and
chief
officers
of
the
temple
and
had
jointly

keys
of
the

of
the
temple

primitive
of

the
lamb
in
the
temple

for
his
benefaction
in
creating
all
things

for
his
benefaction
in

living

the
lamb
as
exalted
above
all
by
the
merits
of
his
death
i
saith
voice
of
many
angels
round
about
the
throne
and
the
beasts
and
the
elders
and
the
number
of
them
was
ten
thousand

ten
thousand
and
thousands
of
thousands
saying
with
a
loud
voice

slain
to
receive

strength
and
honour
and

and
blessing
and
every
creature
which
is

all
that
are
in

be
unto
him
that
sitteth
upon
the
throne
and
unto
the
lamb
for
ever
and
ever
and
the
four
beasts
said
and
the
four
and
twenty
elders
fell
down
and
worshiped
him
that
liveth
for
ever
and
this
was
the
worship
of
the
primitive
it
was
the
custom
for
the
seven
days
before
the
fast
of
the
seventh
month
to
continue
constantly
in
the
temple
and
study
the
book
of
the
law
that
he
might
be
perfect
in
it
against
the
day
of
expiation
wherein
the
service
which
was
various
and
intricate
was
wholly
to
be
performed
by
himself
part
of
which
service
was
reading
the
law
to
the
people
and
to
promote
his
studying
it
there
were
certain
priests
appointed
by
the
to
be
with
him
those
seven
days
in
one
of
his
chambers
in
the
temple
and
there
to
discourse
with
him
about
the
law
and
read
it
to
him
and
put
him
in
mind
of
reading
and
studying
it
himself
this
his
opening
and
reading
the
law
those
seven
days
is
alluded
unto
in
the
lamb
opening
the
seals
we
are
to
conceive
that
those
seven
days
begin
in
the
evening
before
each
day
for
the
began
their
day
in
the
evening
and
that
the
solemnity
of
the
fast
begins
in
the
morning
of
the
seventh
day
the
seventh
seal
was
therefore
opened
on
the
day
of
expiation
and
then
was
silence
in
heaven
for
half
an
hour
and
an
the
at
the
altar
having
a
golden
censer
and
there
was
given
him
much
incense
that
he
should
offer
it
with
the
prayers
of
all
saints
upon
the
golden
altar
which
was
before
the
the
custom
was
on
other
days
for
one
of
the
priests
to
take
fire
from
the
great
altar
in
a
silver
censer
but
on
this
day
for
the
to
take
fire
from
the
great
altar
in
a
golden
censer
and
when
he
was
come
down
from
the
great
altar
he
took
incense
from
one
of
the
priests
who
brought
it
to
him
and
went
with
it
to
the
golden
altar
and
while
he
offered
the
incense
the
people
prayed
without
in
silence
which
is
the
silence
in
heaven
for
half
an
hour
when
the
had
laid
the
incense
on
the
altar
he
carried
a
censer
of
it
burning
in
his
hand
into
the
most
holy
place
before
the
ark
the
smoke
of
the
incense
with
the
prayers
of
the
saints
ascended
up
before
god
out
of
the
angel
on
other
days
there
was
a
certain
measure
of
incense
for
the
golden
altar
on
this
day
there
was
a
greater
quantity
for
both
the
altar
and
the
most
holy
place
and
therefore
it
is
called
after
this
angel
took
the
censer
and
filled
it
with
fire
from
great
and
cast
it
into
the
that
is
by
the
hands
of
the
priests
who
belong
to
his
mystical
body
he
cast
it
to
the
earth
without
the
temple
for
burning
the
goat
which
was
the
lord
lot
at
this
and
other
concomitant
sacrifices
until
the
was
ended
were
voices
and
thundrings
and
lightnings
and
an
that
is
the
voice
of
the
reading
the
law
to
the
people
and
other
voices
and
thundrings
from
the
trumpets
and
at
the
sacrifices
and
lightnings
from
the
fire
of
the
altar
the
solemnity
of
the
day
of
expiation
being
finished
the
seven
angels
found
their
trumpets
at
the
great
sacrifices
of
the
seven
days
of
the
feast
of
tabernacles
and
at
the
same
sacrifices
the
seven
thunders
utter
their
voices
which
are
the
musick
of
the
temple
and
singing
of
the
intermixed
with
the
soundings
of
the
trumpets
and
the
seven
angels
pour
out
their
vials
of
wrath
which
are
the
of
those
sacrifices
when
six
of
the
seals
were
opened
said
after
these
that
is
after
the
visions
of
the
sixth
seal
saw
four
angels
standing
on
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
holding
the
four
winds
of
the
earth
that
the
wind
should
not
blow
on
the
earth
nor
on
the
sea
nor
on
any
tree
and
i
saw
another
angel
ascending
from
the
having
the
seal
of
the
living
god
and
he
cried
with
a
loud
voice
to
the
four
angels
to
whom
it
was
given
to
hurt
the
earth
and
the
sea
saying
hurt
not
the
earth
nor
the
sea
nor
the
trees
till
we
have
sealed
the
servants
of
our
god
in
their
this
sealing
alludes
to
a
tradition
of
the
that
upon
the
day
of
expiation
all
the
people
of
are
sealed
up
in
the
books
of
life
and
death
for
the
in
their
tell
us
that
in
the
beginning
of
every
new
year
or
first
day
of
the
month
the
seventh
month
of
the
sacred
year
three
books
are
opened
in
judgment
the
book
of
life
in
which
the
names
of
those
are
written
who
are
perfectly
just
the
book
of
death
in
which
the
names
of
those
are
written
who
are
atheists
or
very
wicked
and
a
third
book
of
those
whose
judgment
is
suspended
till
the
day
of
expiation
and
whose
names
are
not
written
in
the
book
of
life
or
death
before
that
day
the
first
ten
days
of
this
month
they
call
the
penitential
days
and
all
these
days
they
fast
and
pray
very
much
and
are
very
devout
that
on
the
tenth
day
their
sins
may
be
remitted
and
their
names
may
be
written
in
the
book
of
life
which
day
is
therefore
called
the
day
of
expiation
and
upon
this
tenth
day
in
returning
home
from
the
synagogues
they
say
to
one
another
the
creator
seal
you
to
a
good
for
they
conceive
that
the
books
are
now
sealed
up
and
that
the
sentence
of
god
remains
unchanged
henceforward
to
the
end
of
the
year
the
same
thing
is
signified
by
the
two
goats
upon
whose
foreheads
the
yearly
on
the
day
of
expiation
lays
the
two
lots
inscribed
and
god
lot
signifying
the
people
who
are
sealed
with
the
name
of
god
in
their
foreheads
and
the
lot
which
was
sent
into
the
wilderness
representing
those
who
receive
the
mark
and
name
of
the
beast
and
go
into
the
wilderness
with
the
great
whore
the
servants
of
god
being
therefore
sealed
in
the
day
of
expiation
we
may
conceive
that
this
sealing
is
synchronal
to
the
visions
which
appear
upon
opening
the
seventh
seal
and
that
when
the
lamb
had
opened
six
of
the
seals
and
seen
the
visions
relating
to
the
inside
of
the
sixth
he
looked
on
the
backside
of
the
seventh
leaf
and
then
saw
four
angels
holding
the
four
winds
of
heaven
and
another
angel
ascending
from
the
with
the
seal
of
conceive
also
that
the
angels
which
held
the
four
winds
were
the
first
four
of
the
seven
angels
who
upon
opening
the
seventh
seal
were
seen
standing
before
god
and
that
upon
their
holding
the
winds
was
silence
in
heaven
for
half
an
and
that
while
the
servants
of
god
were
sealing
the
angel
with
the
golden
censer
offered
their
prayers
with
incense
upon
the
golden
altar
and
read
the
law
and
that
so
soon
as
they
were
sealed
the
winds
hurt
the
earth
at
the
sounding
of
the
first
trumpet
and
the
sea
at
the
sounding
of
the
second
these
winds
signifying
the
wars
to
which
the
first
four
trumpets
sounded
for
as
the
first
four
seals
are
distinguished
from
the
three
last
by
the
appearance
of
four
horsemen
towards
the
four
winds
of
heaven
so
the
wars
of
the
first
four
trumpets
are
distinguished
from
those
of
the
three
last
by
representing
these
by
and
the
others
by
great
in
one
of
visions
when
the
captivity
was
at
hand
appeared
a
who
appeared
them
clothed
in
white
linen
and
a
writer
by
his
is
commanded
to
thro
the
midst
of
and
set
a
mark
upon
the
foreheads
of
the
men
that
sigh
and
cry
for
all
the
abominations
done
in
the
midst
and
then
the
six
men
like
the
angels
of
the
first
six
trumpets
are
commanded
to
slay
those
men
who
are
not
marked
conceive
therefore
that
the
hundred
forty
and
four
thousand
are
sealed
to
preserve
them
from
the
plagues
of
the
first
six
trumpets
and
that
at
length
by
the
preaching
of
the
everlasting
gospel
they
grow
into
great
multitude
which
no
man
could
number
of
all
nations
and
kindreds
and
people
and
and
at
the
sounding
of
the
seventh
trumpet
come
out
of
the
great
tribulation
palms
in
their
hands
the
kingdoms
of
this
by
the
war
to
which
that
trumpet
sounds
the
kingdoms
of
god
and
his
for
the
solemnity
of
the
great
was
kept
by
the
upon
the
seventh
or
last
day
of
the
feast
of
tabernacles
the
upon
that
day
carrying
palms
in
their
hands
and
crying
after
six
of
the
angels
answering
to
the
six
men
with
had
sounded
their
trumpets
the
lamb
in
the
form
of
mighty
angel
cane
down
from
heaven
clothed
with
a
cloud
and
a
rainbow
was
upon
his
head
and
his
face
was
as
it
were
the
sun
and
his
feet
as
pillars
of
the
shape
in
which
appeared
in
the
beginning
of
this
prophecy
he
had
in
his
hand
a
little
book
the
book
which
he
had
newly
opened
for
he
received
but
one
book
from
him
that
sitteth
upon
the
throne
and
he
alone
was
worthy
to
open
and
look
on
this
book
he
set
his
right
foot
upon
the
sea
and
his
left
foot
on
the
earth
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
as
when
a
lion
it
was
the
custom
for
the
on
the
day
of
expiation
to
stand
in
an
elevated
place
in
the
peoples
court
at
the
eastern
gate
of
the
priests
court
and
read
the
law
to
the
people
while
the
heifer
and
the
goat
which
was
the
lord
lot
were
burning
without
the
temple
we
may
therefore
suppose
him
standing
in
such
a
manner
that
his
right
foot
might
appear
to
as
it
were
standing
on
the
sea
of
glass
and
his
left
foot
on
the
ground
of
the
house
and
that
he
cried
with
a
loud
voice
in
reading
the
law
on
the
day
of
expiation
when
he
had
cried
seven
thunders
uttered
their
thunders
are
the
voice
of
a
cloud
and
a
cloud
signifies
a
multitude
and
this
multitude
may
be
the
who
sang
with
thundering
voices
and
played
with
musical
instruments
at
the
great
sacrifices
on
the
seven
days
of
the
feast
of
tabernacles
at
which
times
the
trumpets
also
sounded
for
the
trumpets
sounded
and
the
sang
alternately
three
times
at
every
sacrifice
the
prophecy
therefore
of
the
seven
thunders
is
nothing
else
than
a
repetition
of
the
prophecy
of
the
seven
trumpets
in
another
form
the
angel
which
i
saw
stand
upon
the
sea
and
upon
the
earth
lifted
up
his
hand
to
heaven
and
sware
by
him
that
liveth
for
ever
and
ever
after
the
seven
thunders
should
be
time
no
longer
but
in
the
days
of
the
voice
of
the
seventh
angel
when
he
shall
begin
to
sound
the
mystery
of
god
should
be
finished
as
he
hath
declared
to
his
servants
the
the
voices
of
the
thunders
therefore
last
to
the
end
of
this
world
and
so
do
those
of
the
trumpets
the
voice
which
i
heard
from
saith
unto
me
again
and
said
go
and
take
the
little
book
and
i
took
the
little
book
out
of
the
angel
hand
and
ate
it
up
and
it
was
in
my
mouth
sweet
as
honey
and
as
soon
as
i
had
eaten
it
my
belly
was
bitter
and
he
said
unto
me
thou
must
prophesy
again
before
many
peoples
and
nations
and
tongues
and
this
is
an
introduction
to
a
new
prophecy
to
a
repetition
of
the
prophecy
of
the
whole
book
and
alludes
to
eating
a
roll
or
book
spread
open
before
him
and
written
within
and
without
full
of
lamentations
and
mourning
and
woe
but
sweet
in
his
mouth
eating
and
drinking
signify
acquiring
and
possessing
and
eating
the
book
is
becoming
inspired
with
the
prophecy
contained
in
it
it
implies
being
inspired
in
a
vigorous
and
extraordinary
manner
with
the
prophecy
of
the
whole
book
and
therefore
signifies
a
lively
repetition
of
the
whole
prophecy
by
way
of
interpretation
and
begins
not
till
the
first
prophecy
that
of
the
seals
and
trumpets
is
ended
it
was
sweet
in
mouth
and
therefore
begins
not
with
the
bitter
prophecy
of
the
captivity
and
the
being
in
the
outward
court
of
the
temple
and
treading
the
holy
city
under
foot
and
the
prophesying
of
the
in
sackcloth
and
their
smiting
the
earth
with
all
plagues
and
being
killed
by
the
beast
but
so
soon
as
the
prophecy
of
the
trumpets
is
ended
it
begins
with
the
sweet
prophecy
of
the
glorious
in
and
the
victory
of
over
the
dragon
and
after
that
it
is
bitter
in
belly
by
a
large
description
of
the
times
of
the
great
apostacy
the
angel
upon
the
earth
and
sea
rise
and
measure
the
temple
of
god
and
the
altar
and
them
that
worship
that
is
their
courts
with
the
buildings
thereon
viz
the
square
court
of
the
temple
called
the
separate
place
and
the
square
court
of
the
altar
called
the
priests
court
and
the
court
of
them
that
worship
in
the
temple
called
the
new
court
great
which
is
without
the
temple
leave
out
and
measure
it
not
for
it
is
given
to
the
and
the
holy
city
shall
they
tread
under
foot
forty
and
two
this
measuring
hath
reference
to
measuring
the
temple
there
the
whole
temple
including
the
outward
court
was
measured
to
signify
that
it
should
be
rebuilt
in
the
latter
days
here
the
courts
of
the
temple
and
altar
and
they
who
worship
therein
are
only
measured
to
signify
the
building
of
a
second
temple
for
those
that
are
sealed
out
of
all
the
twelve
tribes
of
and
worship
in
the
inward
court
of
sincerity
and
truth
but
is
commanded
to
leave
out
the
outward
court
or
outward
form
of
religion
and
because
it
is
given
to
the
for
the
glorious
woman
in
heaven
the
remnant
of
whole
seed
kept
the
commandments
of
god
and
had
the
testimony
of
continued
the
same
woman
in
outward
form
after
her
flight
into
the
wilderness
whereby
she
quitted
her
former
sincerity
and
piety
and
became
the
great
whore
she
lost
her
chastity
but
kept
her
outward
form
and
shape
and
while
the
tread
the
holy
city
underfoot
and
worship
in
the
outward
court
the
two
witnesses
represented
perhaps
by
the
two
feet
of
the
angel
standing
on
the
sea
and
earth
prophesied
against
them
and
like
and
consume
their
enemies
with
fire
proceeding
out
of
their
mouth
and
to
shut
heaven
that
it
rain
not
in
the
days
of
their
prophecy
and
to
turn
the
waters
into
blood
and
to
smite
the
earth
with
all
plagues
as
often
as
they
that
is
with
the
plagues
of
the
trumpets
and
vials
of
wrath
and
at
length
they
are
slain
rise
again
from
the
dead
and
ascend
up
to
heaven
in
a
cloud
and
then
the
seventh
trumpet
sounds
to
the
day
of
judgment
the
prophecy
being
finished
is
inspired
anew
by
the
eaten
book
and
begins
the
interpretation
thereof
with
these
words
the
temple
of
god
was
opened
in
heaven
and
there
was
seen
in
his
temple
the
ark
of
the
by
the
ark
we
may
know
that
this
was
the
first
temple
for
the
second
temple
had
no
ark
there
were
lightnings
and
voices
and
thundrings
and
an
earthquake
and
great
these
answer
to
the
wars
in
the
empire
during
the
reign
of
the
four
horsemen
who
appeared
upon
opening
the
first
four
seals
there
appeared
a
great
wonder
in
heaven
a
woman
clothed
with
the
in
the
prophecy
the
affairs
of
the
church
begin
to
be
considered
at
the
opening
of
the
fifth
seal
and
in
the
interpretation
they
begin
at
the
same
time
with
the
vision
of
the
church
in
the
form
of
a
woman
in
heaven
there
she
is
persecuted
and
here
she
is
pained
in
travail
the
interpretation
proceeds
down
first
to
the
sealing
of
the
servants
of
god
and
marking
the
rest
with
the
mark
of
the
beast
and
then
to
the
day
of
judgment
represented
by
a
harvest
and
vintage
then
it
returns
back
to
the
times
of
opening
the
seventh
seal
and
interprets
the
prophecy
of
the
seven
trumpets
by
the
pouring
out
of
seven
vials
of
wrath
the
angels
who
pour
them
out
come
out
of
the
of
the
that
is
out
of
the
second
temple
for
the
tabernacle
had
no
outward
court
then
it
returns
back
again
to
the
times
of
measuring
the
temple
and
altar
and
of
the
worshiping
in
the
outward
court
and
of
the
beast
killing
the
witnesses
in
the
streets
of
the
great
city
and
interprets
these
things
by
the
vision
of
woman
sitting
on
the
beast
drunken
with
the
blood
of
the
and
proceeds
in
the
interpretation
downwards
to
the
fall
of
the
great
city
and
the
day
of
judgment
the
whole
prophecy
of
the
book
represented
by
the
book
of
the
law
is
therefore
repeated
and
interpreted
in
the
visions
which
follow
those
of
sounding
the
seventh
trumpet
and
begin
with
that
of
the
temple
of
god
opened
in
heaven
only
the
things
which
the
seven
thunders
uttered
were
not
written
down

the
dragon
and
beast
of
but
with
this
difference
puts
the
dragon
for
the
whole
empire
while
it
continued
entire
because
it
was
entire
when
that
prophecy
was
given
and
the
beast
he
considers
not
till
the
empire
became
divided
and
then
he
puts
the
dragon
for
the
empire
of
the
and
the
beast
for
the
empire
of
the
hence
it
is
that
the
dragon
and
beast
have
common
heads
and
common
horns
but
the
dragon
hath
crowns
only
upon
his
heads
and
the
beast
only
upon
his
horns
because
the
beast
and
his
horns
reigned
not
before
they
were
divided
from
the
dragon
and
when
the
dragon
gave
the
beast
his
throne
the
ten
horns
received
power
as
kings
the
same
hour
with
the
beast
the
heads
are
seven
successive
kings
four
of
them
were
the
four
horsemen
which
appeared
at
the
opening
of
the
first
four
seals
in
the
latter
end
of
the
sixth
head
or
seal
considered
as
present
in
the
visions
it
is
said
of
the
seven
kings
fallen
and
one
is
and
another
is
not
yet
come
and
the
beast
that
was
and
is
being
wounded
to
death
with
a
sword
is
the
eighth
and
of
the
he
was
therefore
a
collateral
part
of
the
seventh
the
horns
are
the
same
with
those
of
fourth
beast
described
above
the
four
horsemen
which
appear
at
the
opening
of
the
first
four
seals
have
been
well
explained
by
excepting
that
i
had
rather
continue
the
third
to
the
end
of
the
reign
of
the
three
and
the
those
being
kings
from
the
and
begin
the
fourth
with
the
reign
of
and
continue
it
till
the
reign
of
for
the
fourth
horseman
upon
a
horse
his
name
was
death
and
hell
followed
with
him
and
power
was
given
them
to
kill
unto
the
fourth
part
of
the
earth
with
the
sword
and
with
famine
and
with
the
plague
and
with
the
beasts
of
the
or
armies
of
invaders
and
rebels
and
as
such
were
the
times
during
all
this
interval
hitherto
the
empire
continued
in
an
undivided
monarchical
form
except
rebellions
and
such
it
is
represented
by
the
four
horsemen
but
divided
it
between
himself
and
and
it
continued
in
that
divided
state
till
the
victory
of
the
great
over
which
put
an
end
to
the
heathen
persecutions
set
on
foot
by
and
and
described
at
the
opening
of
the
fifth
seal
but
this
division
of
the
empire
was
imperfect
the
whole
being
still
under
one
and
the
same
senate
the
same
victory
of
over
a
heathen
persecutor
began
the
fall
of
the
heathen
empire
described
at
the
opening
of
the
sixth
seal
and
the
visions
of
this
seal
continue
till
after
the
reign
of
the
apostate
he
being
a
heathen
emperor
and
reigning
over
the
whole
empire
the
affairs
of
the
church
begin
to
be
considered
at
the
opening
of
the
fifth
seal
as
was
said
above
then
she
is
represented
by
in
the
temple
of
heaven
with
the
of
righteousness
the
of
ceremonies
her
feet
and
upon
her
head
a
crown
of
twelve
relating
to
the
twelve
apostles
and
to
the
twelve
tribes
of
when
she
fled
from
the
temple
into
the
wilderness
she
left
in
the
temple
a
of
her
seed
who
kept
the
commandments
of
god
and
had
the
testimony
of
jesus
and
therefore
before
her
flight
she
represented
the
true
primitive
church
of
god
tho
afterwards
she
degenerated
like
and
in
persecution
cried
travelling
in
birth
and
pained
to
be
and
in
the
end
of
that
persecution
by
the
victory
of
over
brought
forth
a
such
a
child
as
to
rule
all
nations
with
a
rod
of
a
empire
her
by
the
victory
of
over
caught
up
unto
god
and
to
his
throne
and
the
by
the
division
of
the
empire
into
the
and
empires
from
the
first
temple
the
or
spiritually
barren
empire
of
the
where
she
is
found
afterwards
sitting
upon
the
beast
and
upon
the
seven
mountains
and
is
called
great
city
which
reigneth
over
the
kings
of
the
that
is
over
the
ten
kings
who
give
their
kingdom
to
her
beast
but
before
her
flight
there
was
war
in
heaven
between
and
the
dragon
the
and
the
heathen
religions
and
the
dragon
old
serpent
called
the
devil
and
satan
who
deceiveth
the
whole
world
was
cast
out
to
the
earth
and
his
angels
were
cast
out
with
and
heard
a
voice
in
heaven
saying
now
is
come
salvation
and
strength
and
the
kingdom
of
our
god
and
the
power
of
his
for
the
accuser
of
our
brethren
is
cast
down
and
they
overcame
him
by
the
blood
of
the
lamb
and
by
the
word
of
their
testimony
and
they
loved
not
their
lives
unto
the
death
therefore
rejoice
ye
heavens
and
ye
that
dwell
in
them
woe
be
to
the
inhabiters
of
the
earth
and
or
people
of
the
and
empires
the
devil
is
come
down
amongst
you
having
great
wrath
because
he
knoweth
that
he
hath
but
a
short
when
the
dragon
saw
that
he
was
cast
from
the
throne
and
the
caught
up
thither
he
the
woman
which
brought
forth
the
and
to
by
the
division
of
the
empire
between
the
cities
of
and
given
two
wings
of
a
great
the
symbol
of
the
empire
she
might
from
the
first
temple
the
of
to
her
at
mystically
so
called
the
by
the
division
of
the
same
empire
between
the
sons
of
the
great

of
his
mouth
water
as
a
the
empire
the
woman
that
he
might
cause
her
to
be
carried
away
by
the
flood
and
the
or
empire
the
woman
and
the
earth
opened
her
mouth
and
swallowed
up
the
by
the
victory
of
over
and
thus
the
beast
was
wounded
to
death
with
a
sword
the
dragon
was
wroth
with
the
in
the
reign
of
the
apostate
by
a
new
division
of
the
empire
between
and
from
her
into
the
empire
make
war
with
the
remnant
of
her
which
she
left
behind
her
when
she
fled
and
thus
the
beast
revived
by
the
next
division
of
the
empire
which
was
between
and
the
with
ten
horns
out
of
the
and
the
with
two
horns
of
the
and
by
the
last
division
thereof
which
was
between
the
sons
of
dragon
gave
the
beast
his
power
and
throne
and
great
and
the
ten
horns
power
as
kings
the
same
hour
with
the
at
length
the
woman
arrived
at
her
place
of
temporal
as
well
as
spiritual
dominion
upon
the
back
of
the
beast
where
she
is
nourished
time
and
times
and
half
a
time
from
the
face
of
the
not
in
his
kingdom
but
at
a
distance
from
him
she
is
nourished
by
merchants
of
the
three
times
or
years
and
an
half
or
months
or
days
and
in
these
prophecies
days
are
put
for
years
during
all
this
time
the
beast
acted
and
sat
upon
that
is
reigned
over
him
and
over
the
ten
kings
gave
their
power
and
that
is
their
kingdom
the
and
she
was
with
the
blood
of
the
by
all
these
circumstances
she
is
the
eleventh
horn
of
fourth
beast
who
reigned
with
look
more
stout
than
his
and
was
of
a
different
kind
from
the
rest
and
had
eyes
a
like
the
woman
made
war
with
the
saints
and
prevailed
against
and
them
and
to
change
times
and
and
had
them
into
his
hand
until
a
time
and
times
and
half
a
these
characters
of
the
woman
and
little
horn
of
the
beast
agree
perfectly
in
respect
of
her
temporal
dominion
she
was
a
horn
of
the
beast
in
respect
of
her
spiritual
dominion
she
rode
upon
him
in
the
form
of
a
woman
and
was
his
church
and
committed
fornication
with
the
ten
kings
the
second
beast
which
up
out
of
the
was
the
church
of
the
empire
for
it
two
horns
like
those
of
the
and
therefore
was
a
church
and
it
as
the
and
therefore
was
of
his
religion
and
it
up
out
of
the
and
by
consequence
in
his
kingdom
it
is
called
also
false
who
wrought
miracles
before
the
first
beast
by
which
he
deceived
them
that
received
his
mark
and
worshiped
his
image
when
the
dragon
went
from
the
woman
to
make
war
with
the
remnant
of
her
seed
this
beast
arising
out
of
the
earth
assisted
in
that
war
and
the
earth
and
them
which
dwell
therein
to
the
authority
of
first
beast
whose
mortal
wound
was
and
to
an
image
to
that
is
to
assemble
a
body
of
men
like
him
in
point
of
religion
he
had
also
to
give
and
authority
the
so
that
it
could
speak
by
dictating
that
religious
bodies
of
men
would
not
the
authority
of
image
should
mystically
and
he
causeth
all
men
to
receive
a
mark
in
their
right
hand
or
in
their
forehead
and
that
no
man
might
buy
or
sell
save
he
that
had
the
mark
or
the
name
of
the
beast
or
the
number
of
his
all
the
rest
being
excommunicated
by
the
beast
with
two
horns
his
mark
is
cross
cross
cross
and
his
name
greek
lateinos
and
the
number
of
his
name
thus
the
beast
after
he
was
wounded
to
death
with
a
sword
and
revived
was
deified
as
the
heathens
used
to
deify
their
kings
after
death
and
had
an
image
erected
to
him
and
his
worshipers
were
initiated
in
this
new
religion
by
receiving
the
mark
or
name
of
this
new
god
or
the
number
of
his
name
by
killing
all
that
will
not
worship
him
and
his
image
the
first
temple
illuminated
by
the
lamps
of
the
seven
churches
is
demolished
and
a
new
temple
built
for
them
who
will
not
worship
him
and
the
outward
court
of
this
new
temple
or
outward
form
of
a
church
is
given
to
the
who
worship
the
beast
and
his
image
while
they
who
will
not
worship
him
are
sealed
with
the
name
of
god
in
their
foreheads
and
retire
into
the
inward
court
of
this
new
temple
these
are
the
sealed
out
of
all
the
twelve
tribes
of
and
called
the
as
being
derived
from
the
two
wings
of
the
woman
while
she
was
flying
into
the
wilderness
and
represented
by
two
of
the
seven
candlesticks
these
appear
to
in
the
inward
court
of
the
second
temple
standing
on
mount
with
the
lamb
and
as
it
were
on
the
sea
of
glass
these
are
saints
of
the
most
and
host
of
and
holy
spoken
of
by
as
worn
out
and
trampled
under
foot
and
destroyed
in
the
latter
times
by
the
little
horns
of
his
fourth
beast
and
while
the
tread
the
holy
city
under
foot
god
power
to
his
two
witnesses
and
they
prophesy
a
thousand
two
hundred
and
threescore
days
clothed
in
they
are
called
two
with
relation
to
the
two
which
in
vision
chap
iv
stand
on
either
side
of
the
golden
candlestick
to
supply
the
lamps
with
oil
and
according
to
the
apostle
represent
churches
xi
they
supply
the
lamps
with
oil
by
maintaining
teachers
they
are
also
called
two
which
in
this
prophecy
signify
churches
the
seven
churches
of
being
represented
by
seven
candlesticks
five
of
these
churches
were
found
faulty
and
threatned
if
they
did
not
repent
the
other
two
were
without
fault
and
so
their
candlesticks
were
fit
to
be
placed
in
the
second
temple
these
were
the
churches
in
and
they
were
in
a
state
of
tribulation
and
persecution
and
the
only
two
of
the
seven
in
such
a
state
and
so
their
candlesticks
were
fit
to
represent
the
churches
in
affliction
in
the
times
of
the
second
temple
and
the
only
two
of
the
seven
that
were
fit
the
are
not
new
churches
they
are
the
posterity
of
the
primitive
church
the
posterity
of
the
two
wings
of
the
woman
and
so
are
fitly
represented
by
two
of
the
primitive
candlesticks
we
may
conceive
therefore
that
when
the
first
temple
was
destroyed
and
a
new
one
built
for
them
who
worship
in
the
inward
court
two
of
the
seven
candlesticks
were
placed
in
this
new
temple
the
affairs
of
the
church
are
not
considered
during
the
opening
of
the
first
four
seals
they
begin
to
be
consider
at
the
opening
of
the
fifth
seal
as
was
said
above
and
are
further
considered
at
the
opening
of
the
sixth
seal
and
the
seventh
seal
contains
the
times
of
the
great
apostacy
and
therefore
i
refer
the
epistles
to
the
seven
churches
unto
the
times
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
seals
for
they
relate
to
the
church
when
she
began
to
decline
and
contain
admonitions
against
the
great
apostacy
then
approaching
when
had
brought
down
his
to
the
reign
of
he

the

this
was
the
state
of
the
church
just
before
the
subversion
of
the
churches
in
the
beginning
of
persecution
and
to
this
state
of
the
church
agrees
the
first
of
the
seven
epistles
to
the
angel
of
the
seven
churches
that
to
the
church
in
have
something
against
saith
to
the
angel
of
that
church
thou
hast
left
thy

love
remember
therefore
from
whence
thou
art
fallen

repent

will
come
unto
thee

thou

which

are
the
above
described
who
placed

in
abstinence
from
marriage
abandoning
their
wives
if
they
had
any
they
are
here
called
from
one
of
the
seven
deacons
of
the
primitive
church
of
who
having
a
beautiful
wife
and
being
taxed
with
uxoriousness
abandoned
her
and
permitted
her
to
marry
whom
she
pleased
saying
that
we
must
disuse
the
flesh
and
thenceforward
lived
a
single

the

commended
for
hating
their

the
persecution

lasted
ten

and
two
years
in

the

to
the

poverty

thou
art
rich

i
know
the
blasphemy
of

they

not

are
the

none

thou

ten

agree
to
no

that
of
it

the
only
persecution
which
lasted
ten
years
by
blasphemy
of
them
which
say
they

not
but
are
the
synagogue
of
i
understand
the
idolatry
of
the
who
falsly
said
they

are
complained
of
also
in
the
third
epistle
as
men
that
the
doctrine
of
who
taught
to
cast
a

the
children
of
to
eat

sacrificed
to

and
to
spiritual

and
to
tempt
and
invite
by
their
women
to
commit
fornication
and
to
feast
with
them
at
the
sacrifices
of
their
gods
the
dragon
therefore
began
now
to
come
down
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
and
sea
the
are
also
complained
of
in
the
fourth
epistle
under
the
name
of
the
who
calleth
herself
a
prophetess
to
teach
and
to
seduce
the
servants
of
to
commit
fornication
and
to
eat
things
sacrificed
to
the
woman
therefore
began
now
to
fly
into
the
wilderness
the
reign
of
the
great
from
the
time
of
his
conquering
was
monarchical
over
the
whole
empire
then
the
empire
became
divided
between
the
sons
of
and
afterwards
it
was
again
united
under
by
his
victory
over
to
the
affairs
of
the
church
in
these
three
successive
periods
of
time
the
third
fourth
and
fifth
epistles
that
is
those
to
the
angels
of
the
churches
in
and
seem
to
relate
the
next
emperor
was
the
apostate
in
the
sixth
epistle
to
the
angel
of
the
church
in
saith
in
the
reign
of
the
heathen
emperor
hast
kept
the
word
of
my
patience
i
also
will
keep
thee
from
the
hour
of
temptation
by
the
woman
flying
into
the
wilderness
and
the
dragon
making
war
with
the
remnant
of
her
seed
and
the
killing
of
all
who
will
not
worship
the
image
of
the
beast
come
upon
all
the
world
to
try
them
that
dwell
upon
the
and
to
distinguish
them
by
sealing
the
one
with
the
name
of
god
in
their
foreheads
and
marking
the
other
with
the
mark
of
the
beast
that
overcometh
i
will
make
a
pillar
in
the
temple
of
my
god
and
he
shall
go
no
more
of
it
i
will
write
upon
him
the
name
of
my
in
his
forehead
so
the
of
the
church
of
as
many
of
them
as
overcome
are
sealed
with
the
seal
of
god
and
placed
in
the
second
temple
and
go
no
more
out
the
same
is
to
be
understood
of
the
church
in
which
also
kept
the
word
of
god
patience
and
was
without
fault
these
two
churches
with
their
posterity
are
therefore
the
and
the
and
the
in
the
second
temple
after
the
reign
of
the
emperor
and
his
successor
who
reigned
but
five
months
the
empire
became
again
divided
between
and
then
the
church
catholick
in
the
epistle
to
the
angel
of
the
church
of
is
reprehended
as
and
threatned
to
be
out
of
she
said
that
she
was
and
increased
with
goods
and
had
need
of
being
in
outward
prosperity
knew
not
that
she
inwardly
and
miserable
and
poor
and
blind
and
she
is
therefore
out
of
at
the
opening
of
the
seventh
seal
and
this
puts
an
end
to
the
times
of
the
first
temple
about
one
half
of
the
empire
turned
in
the
time
of
the
great
and
his
sons
after
had
opened
the
temples
and
restored
the
worship
of
the
heathens
the
emperors
and
tolerated
it
all
their
reign
and
therefore
the
prophecy
of
the
sixth
seal
was
not
fully
accomplished
before
the
reign
of
their
successor
it
was
the
custom
of
the
heathen
priests
in
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
every
sovereign
emperor
to
offer
him
the
dignity
and
habit
of
the
this
dignity
all
emperors
had
hitherto
accepted
but
rejected
it
threw
down
the
idols
interdicted
the
sacrifices
and
took
away
their
revenues
with
the
salaries
and
authority
of
the
priests
the
great

his
example
and
heathenism
afterwards
recovered
itself
no
more
but
decreased
so
fast
that
about
ten
years
after
the
death
of
called
the
heathens
pauca

the
affairs
of
the
sixth
seal
ended
with
the
reign
of

rather
with
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of

he
like
his
predecessor
rejected
the
dignity
of

very
much
infested

amiss

the

synchronal
to
that
of
sounding

explanation

said
to
them
that
dwell
on
the
earth
that
they
should
make
an
image
to
the
beast
which
had
the
wound
by
a
sword
and
did
that
is
that
they
should
call
a
council
of
men
of
the
religion
of
this
beast
he
had
power
to
give
life
unto
the
image
of
the
beast
that
the
image
of
the
beast
should
both
speak
and
cause
that
as

all

were
excommunicated
when
the
seven
angels
had
poured
out
the
seven
vials
of
wrath
and
had
described
them
all
in
the
present
time
he
is
called
up
from
the
time
of
the
seventh
vial
to
the
time
of
the
sixth
seal
to
take
a
view
of
the
woman
and
her
beast
who
were
to
reign
in
the
times
of
the
seventh
seal
in
respect
of
the
latter
part
of
time
of
the
sixth
seal
then
considered
as
present
the
angel
tells
beast
that
thou
sawest
was
and
is
not
and
shall
ascend
out
of
the
abyss
and
go
into
that
is
he
was
in
the
reign
of
and
until
conquered
and
the
empire
to
the
he
is
not
during
the
reunion
and
he
shall
ascend
out
of
the
abyss
or
sea
at
a
following
division
of
the
empire
the
angel
tells
him
further
is
the
mind
which
hath
wisdom
the
seven
heads
are
seven
mountains
on
which
the
woman
being
built
upon
seven
hills
and
thence
called
the
city
there
are
seven
kings
five
are
fallen
and
one
is
and
the
other
is
not
yet
come
and
when
he
cometh
he
must
continue
a
short
space
and
the
beast
that
was
and
is
not
even
he
is
the
eighth
and
is
of
the
seven
and
goeth
into
five
are
fallen
the
times
of
the
five
first
seals
being
past
and
one
is
the
time
of
the
sixth
seal
being
considered
as
present
and
another
is
not
yet
come
and
when
he
cometh
which
will
be
at
the
opening
of
the
seventh
seal
he
must
continue
a
short
space
and
the
beast
that
was
and
is
not
even
he
is
the
eighth
by
means
of
the
division
of
the
empire
into
two
collateral
empires
and
is
of
the
seven
being
one
half
of
the
seventh
and
shall
go
into
perdition
the
words
are
fallen
and
one
is
and
the
other
is
not
yet
are
usually
referred
by
interpreters
to
the
time
of
the
apostle
when
the
prophecy
was
given
but
it
is
to
be
considered
that
in
this
prophecy
many
things
are
spoken
of
as
present
which
were
not
present
when
the
prophecy
was
given
but
which
would
be
present
with
respect
to
some
future
time
considered
as
present
in
the
visions
thus
where
it
is
said
upon
pouring
out
the
seventh
vial
of
wrath
that
came
in
remembrance
before
god
to
give
unto
her
the
cup
of
the
wine
of
the
fierceness
of
his
this
relates
not
to
the
time
of
the
apostle
but
to
the
time
of
pouring
out
the
seventh
vial
of
wrath
so
where
it
is
said
is
fallen
is
and
in
thy
sickle
and
reap
for
the
time
is
come
for
thee
to
and
time
of
the
dead
is
come
that
they
should
be
and
again
saw
the
dead
small
and
great
stand
before
these
sayings
relate
not
to
the
days
of
the
apostle
but
to
the
latter
times
considered
as
present
in
the
visions
in
like
manner
the
words
are
fallen
and
one
is
and
the
other
is
not
yet
and
beast
that
was
and
is
not
he
is
the
are
not
to
be
referred
to
the
age
of
the
apostle
but
relate
to
the
time
when
the
beast
was
to
be
wounded
to
death
with
a
sword
and
shew
that
this
wound
was
to
be
given
him
in
his
sixth
head
and
without
this
reference
we
are
not
told
in
what
head
the
beast
was
wounded
the
ten
horns
which
thou
sawest
are
ten
kings
which
have
received
no
kingdom
as
yet
but
receive
power
as
kings
one
hour
with
the
beast
these
have
one
being
all
of
the
whore
religion
shall
give
their
power
and
strength
unto
the
beast
these
shall
make
war
with
the
at
the
sounding
of
the
seventh
trumpet
the
lamb
shall
overcome
them
for
he
is
lord
of
lords
and
king
of
kings
and
they
that
are
with
him
are
called
and
chosen
and
faithful
and
he
saith
unto
me
the
waters
which
thou
sawest
where
the
whore
sitteth
are
peoples
and
multitudes
and
nations
and
composing
her
beast
the
ten
horns
which
thou
sawest
upon
the
beast
these
shall
hate
the
whore
and
shall
make
her
desolate
and
naked
and
shall
eat
her
flesh
and
burn
her
with
at
the
end
of
the
days
god
hath
put
in
their
hearts
to
fulfil
his
will
and
to
agree
and
give
their
kingdom
unto
the
beast
until
the
words
of
god
shall
be
fulfilled
and
the
woman
which
thou
sawest
is
that
great
city
which
reigneth
over
the
kings
of
the
or
the
great
city
of
the
which
reigneth
over
the
ten
kings
till
the
end
of
those
days
