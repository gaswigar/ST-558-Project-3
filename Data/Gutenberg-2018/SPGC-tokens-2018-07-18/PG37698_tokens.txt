the
morning
hangs
its
signal
upon
the
mountain

crest
while
all
the
sleeping
valleys
in
silent
darkness
rest
from
peak
to
peak
it
flashes
it
laughs
along
the
sky
that
the
crowning
day
is
coming
by
and
by
we
can
see
the
rose
of
morning
a
glory

the

chapter
i
in
the
year
in
a
pleasant
town
located
between
schenectady
and
albany
stood
the
handsome
colonial
residence
of
hamilton
van
rensselaer
solemn
hedges
shut
in
the
family
pride
and
hid
the
family
sorrow
and
about
the
borders
of
its
spacious
gardens
where
even
the
roses
seemed
subdued
there
played
a
child
the
stately
house
oppressed
her
and
she
loved
the
sombre
garden
best
her
only
friend
in
the
old
house
seemed
a
tall
clock
that
stood
on
the
stairs
and
told
out
the
hours
in
the
hopeless
tone
that
was
expected
of
a
clock
in
such
a
house
though
it
often
took
time
to
wink
pleasantly
at
the
child
as
she
passed
by
and
talk
off
a
few
seconds
and
minutes
in
a
brighter
tone
but
the
great
clock
on
the
staircase
ticked
awesomely
one
morning
as
the
little
girl
went
slowly
down
to
her
father
s
study
in
response
to
his
bidding
she
did
not
want
to
go
she
delayed
her
steps
as
much
as
possible
and
looked
up
at
the
kindly
old
clock
for
sympathy
but
even
the
sun
and
the
friendly
moon
that
went
around
on
the
clock
face
every
day
as
regularly
as
the
real
sun
and
moon
and
usually
appeared
to
be
bowing
and
smiling
at
her
wore
solemn
expressions
and
seemed
almost
pale
behind
their
highly
painted
countenances
the
little
girl
shuddered
as
she
gave
one
last
look
over
her
shoulder
at
them
and
passed
into
the
dim
recesses
of
the
back
hall
where
the
light
came
only
in
weird
slants
from
the
mullioned
window
over
the
front
door
it
was
dreadful
indeed
when
the
jolly
sun
and
moon
looked
grave
she
paused
before
the
heavy
door
of
the
study
and
held
her
breath
dreading
the
ordeal
that
was
to
come
then
gathering
courage
she
knocked
timidly
and
heard
her
father
s
instant
cold
come
with
trembling
fingers
she
turned
the
knob
and
went
in
there
were
heavy
damask
curtains
at
the
windows
reaching
to
the
floor
caught
back
with
thick
silk
cords
and
tassels
they
were
a
deep
sullen
red
and
filled
the
room
with
oppressive
shadows
in
no
wise
relieved
by
the
heavy
mahogany
furniture
upholstered
in
the
same
red
damask
her
father
sat
by
his
ponderous
desk
always
littered
with
papers
which
she
must
not
touch
his
sternly
handsome
face
was
forbidding
the
very
beauty
of
it
was
hateful
to
her
the
look
on
it
reminded
her
of
that
terrible
day
now
nearly
three
years
ago
when
he
had
returned
from
a
journey
of
several
months
abroad
in
connection
with
some
brilliant
literary
enterprise
and
had
swept
her
lovely
mother
out
of
his
life
and
home
the
innocent
victim
of
jealousy
and
most
unfounded
suspicion
the
little
girl
had
been
too
young
to
understand
what
it
was
all
about
when
she
cried
for
her
she
was
forbidden
even
to
think
of
her
and
was
told
that
her
mother
was
unworthy
of
that
name
the
child
had
declared
with
angry
tears
and
stampings
of
her
small
foot
that
it
was
not
true
that
her
mother
was
good
and
dear
and
beautiful
but
they
had
paid
no
heed
to
her
the
father
had
sternly
commanded
silence
and
sent
her
away
and
the
mother
had
not
returned
so
she
had
sobbed
her
heart
out
in
the
silence
of
her
own
room
where
every
object
reminded
her
of
the
lost
mother
s
touch
and
voice
and
presence
and
had
gone
about
the
house
in
a
sullen
silence
unnatural
to
childhood
thereby
making
herself
more
enemies
than
friends
of
her
father
she
was
afraid
she
shrank
into
terrified
silence
whenever
he
approached
scarcely
answering
his
questions
and
growing
farther
away
from
him
every
day
until
he
instinctively
knew
that
she
hated
him
for
her
mother
s
sake
when
a
year
had
passed
he
procured
a
divorce
without
protest
from
the
innocent
but
crushed
wife
this
by
aid
of
a
law
that
often
places
truth
forever
on
the
scaffold
wrong
forever
on
the
throne
not
long
after
he
brought
to
his
home
as
his
wife
a
capable
arrogant
woman
who
set
herself
to
rule
him
and
his
household
as
it
should
be
ruled
the
little
girl
was
called
to
audience
in
the
gloomy
study
where
sat
the
new
wife
her
eyes
filled
with
hostility
toward
the
other
woman
s
child
and
was
told
that
she
must
call
the
lady
mother
then
the
black
eyes
that
held
in
their
dreamy
depths
some
of
the
gunpowder
flash
of
her
father
s
steely
ones
took
fire
the
little
face
darkened
with
indignant
fury
the
small
foot
came
down
with
fierce
determination
on
the
thick
carpet
and
the
child
declared
i
will
call
her
mother
she
is
my
mother
she
is
a
bad
woman
and
she
has
no
right
here
she
can
not
be
your
wife
it
is
wicked
for
a
man
to
have
two
wives
i
know
for
i
heard
mary
ann
and
betsey
say
so
this
morning
in
the
kitchen
my
mother
is
alive
yet
she
is
at
grandfather
s
i
heard
betsey
say
that
too
you
are
a
wicked
cruel
man
and
i
hate
you
i
will
not
have
you
for
a
father
any
more
i
will
go
away
and
stay
with
my
mother
she
is
good
are
bad
i
hate
you
i
hate
you
hate
i
hate
toward
the
new
wife
who
sat
in
horrified
condemnation
with
two
fiery
spots
upon
her
outraged
cheeks
jemima
thundered
her
father
in
his
angriest
tone
but
the
little
girl
turned
upon
him
furiously
my
name
is
not
jemima
she
screamed
i
will
not
let
you
call
me
so
my
name
is
dawn
my
mother
called
me
dawn
i
will
not
answer
when
you
call
me
jemima
jemima
you
may
go
to
your
room
commanded
the
father
standing
up
white
to
the
lips
to
face
a
will
no
whit
less
adamant
than
his
own
i
will
not
go
until
you
call
me
dawn
she
answered
her
face
turning
white
and
stern
with
sudden
singular
likeness
to
her
father
on
its
soft
round
outlines
she
stood
her
ground
until
carried
struggling
upstairs
and
locked
into
her
own
room
gradually
she
had
cried
her
fury
out
and
succumbed
to
the
inevitable
creeping
back
as
seldom
as
possible
into
the
life
of
the
house
and
spending
the
time
with
her
own
brooding
thoughts
and
sad
plays
far
in
the
depths
of
the
garden
or
shut
into
the
quiet
of
her
own
room
to
the
new
mother
she
never
spoke
unless
she
had
to
and
never
called
her
mother
though
there
were
many
struggles
to
compel
her
to
do
so
she
never
came
when
they
called
her
jemima
nor
obeyed
a
command
prefaced
by
that
name
though
she
endured
in
consequence
many
a
whipping
and
many
a
day
in
bed
fed
on
bread
and
water
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
strange
whim
demanded
the
new
wife
with
set
lips
her
position
was
none
too
easy
nor
her
disposition
markedly
that
of
a
saint
a
bit
of
her
mother
s
sentimentality
explained
the
chagrined
father
she
objected
to
calling
the
child
for
my
grandmother
jemima
she
wanted
it
named
for
her
own
mother
and
said
jemima
was
harsh
and
ugly
until
one
day
her
old
minister
who
was
fully
as
sentimental
as
she
if
he
was
an
old
man
told
her
that
jemima
meant
dawn
of
the
after
that
she
made
no
further
protest
but
i
had
no
idea
she
had
carried
her
foolishness
to
this
extent
nor
taught
the
child
such
notions
about
her
honest
and
honorable
name
it
won
t
take
long
to
get
them
out
of
her
head
prophesied
the
with
the
sparkle
of
combat
in
her
eye
yet
it
was
now
nearly
three
years
since
the
little
girl
had
seen
or
heard
from
her
mother
and
she
still
refused
to
answer
to
the
name
of
jemima
the
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
saying
you
when
she
wanted
anything
done
of
the
events
which
preceded
her
father
s
summons
this
morning
dawn
knew
nothing
three
days
before
he
had
received
an
urgent
message
from
his
former
wife
s
father
stating
that
his
daughter
was
dead
and
demanding
an
immediate
interview
it
was
couched
in
such
language
that
being
the
man
he
was
he
could
not
refuse
to
comply
he
answered
the
summons
immediately
going
by
horseback
a
hard
ride
that
he
might
catch
an
earlier
stage
than
he
could
otherwise
have
done
he
was
the
kind
of
man
that
always
did
what
he
felt
to
be
his
duty
no
matter
how
unpleasant
it
might
be
it
was
the
only
thing
that
saved
his
severity
from
being
a
vice
his
had
laid
this
journey
upon
him
as
a
duty
and
though
he
had
no
definite
idea
of
the
reason
for
this
sudden
demand
he
went
at
once
no
one
but
his
maker
can
penetrate
the
soul
of
a
man
like
hamilton
van
rensselaer
to
know
what
were
his
thoughts
as
he
walked
up
the
path
to
the
fine
old
brick
house
which
a
few
years
before
he
had
trod
with
his
beautiful
young
bride
leaning
upon
his
arm
with
grave
ceremony
the
old
servant
opened
the
door
into
the
stately
front
room
where
most
of
van
rensselaer
s
courting
had
been
done
and
left
him
alone
in
the
dim
light
that
sifted
through
partly
drawn
shades
he
stood
a
moment
within
the
shadowed
room
a
sense
of
the
past
sweeping
over
him
with
oppressive
force
like
a
power
that
might
not
be
resisted
then
as
his
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
the
he
started
for
there
before
him
was
a
coffin
his
s
message
had
not
led
him
to
expect
to
see
his
former
wife
he
had
gathered
from
the
letter
that
she
might
have
been
dead
some
weeks
and
that
the
matter
to
be
discussed
was
of
business
though
probably
painfully
connected
with
the
one
who
was
gone
while
the
news
of
her
death
had
given
him
a
shock
which
he
had
not
anticipated
he
had
yet
had
time
in
his
long
journey
to
grow
accustomed
to
the
thought
of
it
but
he
was
in
no
wise
prepared
to
meet
the
sight
of
her
lying
there
in
her
last
sleep
so
still
and
white
strangely
moved
he
stepped
nearer
not
understanding
why
he
felt
thus
toward
one
whom
he
firmly
believed
had
made
utter
wreck
of
his
life
she
lay
in
a
simple
white
gown
like
the
one
she
used
to
wear
when
he
first
knew
her
in
her
hand
was
one
white
rose
it
might
have
come
from
her
wedding
bouquet
the
soft
fragrance
of
it
floated
up
and
smote
him
with
keen
and
unexpected
pain
the
rose
had
reached
where
a
sword
could
not
have
penetrated
death
had
kindly
erased
the
deep
lines
of
suffering
from
mary
montgomery
s
beautiful
face
and
told
no
tales
of
the
broken
heart
but
to
see
what
he
had
once
loved
pure
and
lovely
as
it
used
to
be
with
no
trace
of
the
havoc
he
had
wrought
upon
it
spoke
louder
to
the
conscience
of
the
man
than
a
sorrowful
face
could
have
done
for
then
he
might
have
turned
from
her
with
a
hardened
heart
saying
it
was
all
her
own
fault
and
she
had
got
only
what
she
deserved
but
to
see
her
thus
was
as
if
god
s
finger
had
touched
her
and
exonerated
her
from
all
blame
the
sight
shook
the
very
foundations
of
his
belief
in
her
disgrace
he
was
filled
with
conflicting
emotions
he
had
not
supposed
that
he
could
feel
this
way
for
he
had
thought
that
his
love
for
mary
was
dead
yet
it
had
raised
its
dishonored
head
and
given
him
one
piercing
look
while
it
had
seemed
to
say
to
his
heart
you
are
too
late
you
are
too
late
the
sound
of
footsteps
coming
down
the
hall
recalled
him
to
himself
it
came
to
him
that
this
was
what
he
had
been
brought
here
for
this
dramatic
effect
of
mary
s
death
perhaps
for
revenge
perhaps
to
try
to
make
him
acknowledge
that
he
had
been
in
the
wrong
he
stiffened
visibly
and
turned
toward
the
door
his
heart
so
accustomed
to
the
hardening
process
grew
adamant
again
and
he
was
ready
with
a
haughty
word
to
greet
the
father
but
the
dignity
of
the
man
who
entered
the
room
held
him
in
check
montgomery
went
over
to
the
window
merely
giving
his
visitor
a
grave
bow
in
passing
and
pushed
up
the
heavy
shades
the
sunlight
burst
joyously
in
upon
the
solemnity
of
the
room
unhindered
by
the
sheer
muslin
curtains
and
flung
its
golden
glory
about
the
sweet
face
in
the
coffin
making
a
halo
of
light
above
the
soft
dark
waves
of
hair
the
younger
man
s
eyes
were
drawn
irresistibly
to
look
at
her
once
more
and
the
sight
startled
him
more
than
ever
for
now
she
seemed
like
a
crowned
saint
whose
irreproachable
life
was
too
sacred
for
him
to
come
near
the
old
man
came
over
and
stood
in
the
pathway
of
light
from
the
window
though
not
so
as
to
hinder
its
falling
on
the
dead
face
and
turned
toward
his
former
then
and
not
till
then
did
the
visitor
notice
that
the
old
man
held
in
his
arms
a
beautiful
boy
between
two
and
three
years
old
proudly
the
grandfather
stood
with
the
chubby
arm
around
his
neck
and
the
dimpled
fingers
patting
his
cheek
the
sunlight
fell
in
a
broad
illumination
over
the
head
and
face
of
the
child
kindling
into
flame
the
masses
of
tumbled
curls
which
showed
the
same
rich
mahogany
tint
that
had
always
made
hamilton
van
rensselaer
s
head
a
distinguished
mark
in
any
company
the
baby
s
eyes
were
a
wonderful
gray
which
even
now
held
flashes
of
flashes
of
fun
and
not
of
passion
as
the
man
looked
they
mirrored
back
his
own
startlingly
in
the
round
baby
cheeks
were
two
dimples
strikingly
placed
the
counterpart
of
two
that
daring
nature
had
triflingly
set
in
the
otherwise
stern
countenance
of
the
man
the
likeness
was
marvellous
in
sheer
astonishment
the
man
gazed
at
the
child
and
then
as
he
looked
the
baby
frowned
and
he
saw
his
own
face
in
miniature
identical
even
to
the
sternness
which
was
the
prevailing
expression
of
his
countenance
suddenly
the
man
felt
that
he
stood
before
god
and
was
being
judged
and
rebuked
for
his
treatment
of
the
dead
the
awful
remorse
that
stung
his
soul
burst
forth
in
a
single
sentence
which
was
wrung
from
him
by
an
unseen
force
why
did
you
never
tell
me
he
flashed
the
rebuke
at
the
old
man
but
the
dark
eyes
under
the
heavy
white
brows
only
looked
at
him
the
more
steadily
and
did
not
flinch
as
if
they
would
tell
him
to
look
to
himself
for
an
answer
to
his
question
the
steady
gaze
did
its
work
it
was
the
nemesis
before
which
his
pride
and
fell
his
glance
went
from
the
righteous
face
of
the
old
man
to
the
pure
and
beautiful
eyes
of
the
boy
now
frowning
with
disapproval
and
he
dropped
into
a
chair
with
a
groan
i
have
been
wrong
he
said
and
bowed
his
head
the
last
atom
of
his
pride
rent
away
from
him
there
beside
the
dead
great
scorching
tears
of
bitterness
found
their
way
to
his
eyes
washing
away
the
scales
of
blind
conceit
and
bringing
clearer
vision
mary
montgomery
was
vindicated
in
the
eyes
of
the
man
who
had
wronged
her
but
the
baby
frowned
and
cried
softly
hush
bad
man
you
go
away
you
wake
my
pitty
muvver
she
s
s
eep
the
strong
man
shrank
from
the
child
s
words
as
from
a
blow
and
looked
up
with
almost
a
pleading
on
his
usually
cold
face
but
the
old
man
watched
him
sternly
yes
it
is
enough
you
may
go
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
now
you
understand
this
is
why
i
sent
for
you
it
was
her
right
but
said
the
stricken
man
and
looked
toward
the
sleeping
one
in
the
coffin
may
i
not
wait
you
have
no
right
the
old
man
answered
sternly
and
the
young
man
turned
away
with
a
strange
wild
feeling
tearing
his
throat
like
a
sob
no
i
have
no
right
then
with
a
sudden
movement
he
turned
toward
the
child
as
if
he
would
claim
something
there
but
the
baby
hid
his
face
and
clung
to
his
grandfather
s
neck
i
have
no
right
he
said
again
one
last
look
he
gave
the
sweet
dead
face
as
though
he
would
ask
forgiveness
then
turned
and
went
unsteadily
from
the
room
the
old
father
followed
him
silently
as
though
to
complete
some
ceremony
and
closing
the
door
softly
behind
him
spoke
a
few
words
of
explanation
facts
that
had
they
been
brought
forth
sooner
might
have
made
all
things
different
it
was
mary
s
wish
that
no
word
should
be
spoken
in
her
vindication
while
she
lived
if
her
husband
could
not
trust
what
she
had
told
him
when
he
first
came
home
it
mattered
not
to
her
what
he
believed
the
hope
of
her
life
was
crushed
but
now
that
she
was
beyond
further
pain
and
for
the
boy
s
sake
her
father
had
sent
for
him
that
he
might
know
these
things
before
the
wife
he
had
wronged
was
laid
to
rest
then
van
rensselaer
felt
himself
dismissed
and
with
one
last
look
at
the
huddled
figure
of
his
little
son
who
still
kept
his
face
hid
he
went
down
the
path
again
his
pride
utterly
crushed
his
life
a
broken
thing
after
him
echoed
the
sound
of
a
baby
s
voice
go
away
bad
man
and
then
the
great
oak
door
closed
quickly
behind
him
for
the
last
time
he
trod
the
streets
of
the
village
as
in
a
nightmare
and
knew
not
that
there
were
those
in
his
way
who
would
have
tarred
and
feathered
him
if
it
had
not
been
for
love
of
the
honored
dead
and
her
family
straight
into
the
country
he
walked
to
the
next
village
and
knew
not
how
far
he
had
come
there
he
hired
a
horse
and
rode
to
the
next
stage
route
and
so
resting
not
even
at
night
he
came
to
his
home
but
ever
on
the
way
he
had
been
attended
by
a
vision
on
the
left
a
figure
in
a
coffin
with
one
white
rose
whose
perfume
stifled
him
and
on
the
right
by
a
boy
with
eyes
that
pierced
his
very
soul
and
whether
on
horseback
or
by
stage
in
the
company
of
others
or
alone
in
a
dreary
woodland
road
they
were
there
on
either
hand
and
he
knew
they
would
be
so
while
life
for
him
should
last
he
reached
home
in
the
gray
of
a
morning
that
was
to
become
a
gray
day
and
sent
up
word
that
his
little
daughter
should
come
down
to
his
study
when
her
early
tasks
were
finished
he
had
not
said
a
word
to
his
wife
as
yet
though
she
had
suspected
where
he
was
going
when
he
told
her
that
mary
montgomery
was
dead
it
lifted
a
great
load
from
her
shoulders
to
know
that
the
other
wife
was
no
longer
living
she
had
been
going
about
these
three
days
with
almost
a
smile
upon
her
hard
countenance
and
the
little
girl
had
had
no
easy
time
of
it
with
her
father
away
it
was
very
still
in
the
study
after
dawn
sat
down
in
the
chair
opposite
her
father
she
could
hear
the
old
clock
tick
solemnly
slowly
it
said
until
the
tears
began
to
smart
in
her
eyes
her
father
sat
with
his
elbow
on
the
desk
and
his
handsome
head
bowed
upon
his
hand
he
did
not
raise
his
head
when
she
entered
she
began
to
wonder
if
he
was
asleep
and
her
heart
beat
with
awe
and
dread
nothing
good
had
ever
come
to
her
out
of
these
interviews
in
the
study
perhaps
he
was
going
to
send
her
away
too
as
he
had
sent
her
mother
her
little
face
hardened
well
she
would
be
glad
to
go
what
if
he
should
send
her
to
her
mother
oh
that
would
be
joy
he
never
would
she
was
a
beautiful
child
as
she
sat
there
palpitating
with
fear
and
hope
her
face
was
like
her
mother
s
fair
with
color
and
eyes
that
were
dark
and
dreamy
always
looking
out
with
longing
and
appeal
her
hair
like
her
father
s
only
in
its
tendency
to
curl
was
fine
and
dark
and
fell
about
the
little
troubled
face
it
had
been
the
cause
of
many
a
contention
between
her
and
her
who
wished
to
plait
it
smoothly
into
braids
which
she
considered
the
only
neat
way
for
a
child
s
hair
to
be
arranged
failing
in
that
she
had
tried
to
cut
it
off
but
the
child
had
defended
her
curls
so
fiercely
that
they
had
finally
let
her
alone
it
was
wonderful
what
care
the
little
girl
took
of
them
herself
for
it
was
no
small
task
to
keep
such
a
head
of
hair
well
brushed
but
dawn
could
remember
how
her
mother
loved
her
curls
and
she
clung
to
them
when
she
lifted
the
dark
lashes
there
was
a
light
in
her
eyes
that
made
one
think
of
the
dawn
of
day
such
eyes
had
her
mother
at
last
dawn
looked
up
tremulously
to
her
father
and
he
spoke
he
did
not
look
toward
her
however
and
his
voice
was
cold
and
reserved
i
have
sent
for
you
my
dawn
was
glad
he
did
not
use
the
hateful
name
jemima
tell
you
that
your
mother
was
a
good
woman
of
course
said
the
child
with
rising
color
i
knew
that
all
the
time
why
did
you
ever
say
she
wasn
t
there
was
a
terrible
mistake
made
the
father
s
voice
was
shaken
it
gave
dawn
a
curious
feeling
who
made
the
mistake
she
asked
gravely
the
room
was
very
still
while
this
arrow
found
its
way
into
the
father
s
heart
i
did
his
voice
sounded
hoarse
the
little
girl
felt
almost
sorry
for
him
oh
then
you
will
bring
her
right
back
to
us
again
and
send
this
other
woman
away
won
t
you
child
your
mother
is
dead
dawn
s
face
went
as
white
as
death
and
she
sprang
to
her
feet
clasping
her
hands
in
horror
then
you
have
killed
her
she
screamed
you
have
killed
her
my
beautiful
mother
and
with
a
wild
cry
she
flung
herself
upon
the
floor
and
broke
into
a
passion
of
tears
the
strong
man
writhed
in
anguish
as
his
little
child
set
the
mark
of
cain
upon
his
forehead
the
outcry
brought
the
but
neither
noticed
her
as
she
entered
and
demanded
the
reason
for
this
scene
she
tried
to
pick
the
child
up
from
the
floor
but
dawn
only
beat
her
off
with
kicks
and
screams
and
they
finally
went
away
and
left
her
weeping
there
upon
the
floor
her
father
took
his
hat
and
walked
out
into
the
woods
there
he
stayed
for
hours
while
the
wife
went
about
with
set
lips
and
a
glint
in
her
eye
that
boded
no
good
for
the
child
finally
the
sobs
grew
less
and
less
frequent
and
the
old
clock
in
the
hall
could
again
be
heard
in
her
ears
as
she
sobbed
herself
slowly
to
sleep
it
was
after
this
that
they
sent
her
away
to
school
chapter
ii
her
father
placed
her
on
a
hudson
river
steamer
in
charge
of
the
captain
whom
he
knew
and
in
company
with
two
other
little
girls
who
were
returning
to
the
school
of
friend
isaac
and
friend
ruth
after
a
short
vacation
dawn
attired
in
the
grave
quaker
garb
of
the
school
leaned
over
the
rail
of
the
deck
inconsequently
swinging
by
its
ribbons
her
long
gray
pocket
containing
a
hundred
dollars
wherewith
to
pay
her
entrance
fee
and
provide
necessities
and
watched
her
unloved
father
walk
away
from
the
landing
thee
and
thou
and
thy
long
pocket
called
out
a
saucy
to
the
three
little
girls
and
dawn
turned
with
an
angry
flash
in
her
eyes
to
take
up
the
work
of
facing
the
world
she
did
not
drop
the
pocket
into
the
water
nor
fall
overboard
but
bore
herself
discreetly
all
through
the
journey
and
made
her
entrance
into
the
new
life
demurely
save
for
the
independent
stand
she
took
upon
her
arrival
my
name
is
dawn
van
rensselaer
and
my
mother
wishes
me
to
wear
my
curls
just
as
they
are
her
two
had
given
her
cause
to
believe
that
there
would
be
an
immediate
raid
made
upon
her
precious
curls
and
her
determined
spirit
decided
to
make
a
stand
at
the
start
and
not
to
give
in
for
anything
the
quiet
remark
created
almost
a
panic
for
a
brief
moment
coming
thus
unexpectedly
into
the
decorous
order
of
the
place
friend
ruth
caught
her
breath
and
two
faint
pink
spots
appeared
in
her
smooth
cheeks
thee
will
wear
thy
hair
smoothly
plaited
child
as
the
others
do
unless
it
be
cut
close
she
said
decidedly
laying
her
thin
pink
lips
smoothly
together
over
even
teeth
thee
will
write
to
thy
mother
that
it
is
our
custom
here
to
allow
nothing
frivolous
or
worldly
in
the
dress
of
our
pupils
one
glance
at
the
cool
gray
eye
of
her
oppressor
decided
dawn
to
hide
in
her
heart
forever
the
fact
that
the
mother
whose
wish
she
was
flaunting
was
no
more
in
this
world
nor
longer
had
the
legal
right
to
express
her
wishes
concerning
her
child
with
ready
wits
she
argued
the
matter
but
it
isn
t
worldly
god
made
my
curls
and
it
is
just
as
bad
to
plait
them
up
and
take
out
the
curl
as
it
would
be
to
go
to
work
and
curl
them
on
an
iron
if
they
were
straight
my
curls
are
n
t
frivolous
and
i
take
care
of
them
myself
my
mother
loves
them
and
i
must
do
as
she
says
friend
ruth
looked
at
the
determined
little
face
set
in
its
frame
of
dark
curls
and
hesitated
she
was
not
used
to
logic
from
a
child
yet
there
seemed
to
be
reason
in
the
words
besides
friend
ruth
was
a
great
advocate
of
honor
to
parents
it
was
a
complicated
question
she
decided
to
temporize
i
will
speak
to
friend
isaac
about
the
matter
but
thee
will
have
to
wear
them
in
a
net
it
is
untidy
to
have
curls
tumbling
about
thy
face
that
was
the
end
of
the
matter
dawn
wore
her
curls
without
further
question
albeit
in
a
plain
dark
net
though
outwardly
the
little
girl
was
docile
except
upon
occasion
friend
ruth
learned
to
avoid
any
crossing
of
swords
with
the
young
logician
for
she
nearly
always
got
the
worst
of
it
dawn
took
to
learning
as
a
bird
to
the
air
having
inherited
her
father
s
brilliant
mind
and
taste
for
letters
combined
with
her
mother
s
keen
insight
and
wide
perceptive
faculties
her
lessons
were
always
easily
and
perfectly
learned
and
she
looked
with
contempt
upon
the
plodders
who
could
not
get
time
from
their
tasks
for
the
fun
which
she
was
always
ready
to
lead
the
pranks
she
played
were
many
on
one
occasion
she
led
an
expedition
of
the
entire
school
in
a
slide
down
a
newly
made
thereby
damaging
its
geometrical
shape
and
necessitating
several
hours
work
by
the
farmhands
as
a
punishment
she
was
remanded
to
the
garden
alone
to
write
a
composition
on
the
beauties
of
nature
it
began
a
great
green
worm
come
cameing
down
the
populo
tree
with
great
tribusence
friend
ruth
read
the
finished
composition
with
the
dismay
of
a
hen
which
has
a
duck
on
its
hands
and
handed
it
over
to
friend
isaac
the
child
has
an
original
mind
and
is
going
to
be
a
brilliant
woman
he
remarked
gravely
yes
isaac
but
thee
will
not
tell
her
so
said
friend
ruth
quickly
six
years
had
passed
since
dawn
a
child
of
ten
had
come
to
the
school
and
she
had
never
gone
home
it
had
been
her
own
wish
and
for
once
her
father
and
stepmother
were
willing
to
accede
to
her
to
both
the
sight
of
her
and
the
thought
of
her
were
painful
her
father
had
visited
her
every
year
and
brought
with
him
a
full
supply
of
the
modest
wardrobe
that
the
school
allowed
and
dawn
had
money
to
meet
all
her
necessary
expenses
she
lived
a
sort
of
triple
in
the
world
of
her
studies
in
which
she
sometimes
took
deep
delight
often
going
far
ahead
of
her
classes
because
she
wanted
to
see
what
came
next
one
in
the
world
of
play
where
she
was
leader
in
all
sorts
of
mischief
getting
the
older
ones
into
endless
difficulties
with
the
teachers
and
protecting
the
little
ones
even
to
her
own
detriment
at
times
the
third
life
was
lived
alone
in
the
fields
or
the
woods
where
she
might
sit
quietly
and
look
up
into
the
blue
sky
listening
to
the
music
of
the
winds
and
the
birds
or
the
sad
chirp
of
a
cricket
taking
a
little
grasshopper
into
her
confidence
talking
to
a
friendly
squirrel
on
the
maple
bough
was
where
she
really
lived
on
the
walls
of
her
memory
were
hung
strange
sad
pictures
of
the
past
always
on
such
occasions
the
mother
all
in
white
with
starry
eyes
hovered
over
her
and
seemed
to
listen
to
the
wild
longing
that
beat
in
her
young
heart
and
to
pour
a
benediction
upon
her
she
could
not
think
of
her
father
except
sadly
or
bitterly
and
so
as
much
as
possible
she
put
him
out
of
her
thoughts
by
degrees
as
she
came
to
see
on
his
annual
visits
how
old
and
careworn
he
was
grown
how
haunted
and
haggard
were
his
eyes
she
grew
to
pity
him
but
never
to
love
for
her
mother
had
been
her
idol
and
he
had
killed
her
mother
that
the
girl
could
not
forget
though
as
she
grew
older
she
felt
with
a
kind
of
spiritual
instinct
that
she
must
forgive
she
felt
it
was
his
own
blindness
and
stupidity
that
had
done
it
and
that
he
was
suffering
some
measure
of
punishment
for
his
deed
she
never
actually
put
these
thoughts
before
her
in
so
many
words
they
were
rather
a
sort
of
growing
undertone
of
consciousness
in
her
as
her
mental
and
spiritual
faculties
developed
in
one
year
more
she
would
be
through
with
the
school
course
for
some
time
she
had
been
dreading
the
thought
and
wondering
what
would
come
to
her
next
if
she
might
go
somewhere
and
teach
school
she
felt
certain
her
father
would
never
allow
that
he
was
proud
and
held
ideas
about
woman
s
sphere
though
she
could
scarcely
be
said
to
know
him
well
still
she
felt
without
asking
that
he
would
never
consent
sometimes
she
even
entertained
vague
thoughts
of
running
away
when
she
should
be
through
school
for
the
idea
of
dwelling
under
her
father
s
roof
again
under
control
of
the
woman
who
had
usurped
her
mother
s
place
she
could
not
abide
it
was
therefore
with
trepidation
that
she
received
a
message
in
the
one
morning
bidding
her
come
to
the
parlor
to
meet
her
father
the
fair
face
flushed
and
the
brow
darkened
with
trouble
it
was
not
the
usual
time
for
her
father
s
annual
visit
did
it
mean
that
he
was
going
to
take
her
away
from
the
school
her
young
heart
beat
to
the
old
tune
of
the
friendly
clock
at
home
as
she
went
to
answer
the
summons
but
in
the
square
plain
parlor
with
its
furniture
its
gray
paper
and
its
ingrain
carpet
there
sat
two
men
with
friend
ruth
instead
of
one
her
father
looked
older
than
ever
before
his
hair
was
silvering
about
the
edges
though
he
was
still
what
would
have
been
called
a
young
man
the
stranger
was
younger
yet
with
an
old
look
about
his
eyes
as
if
they
had
been
living
longer
than
the
rest
of
his
face
dawn
paused
in
the
doorway
and
looked
from
one
to
the
other
she
had
put
up
her
hand
as
she
reached
the
door
and
drawn
from
her
head
the
net
which
held
her
beautiful
curls
in
leash
they
fell
about
her
lovely
face
in
the
fashion
of
the
day
they
were
grown
long
and
thick
but
still
kept
their
baby
softness
and
fineness
of
texture
she
made
a
charming
picture
standing
thus
with
the
in
her
hand
hesitating
almost
shyly
though
she
was
not
unduly
shy
even
in
her
quaker
garb
with
the
sheer
folds
of
the
snowy
kerchief
about
her
neck
she
looked
an
unusually
beautiful
girl
the
young
stranger
saw
and
took
notice
as
he
rose
to
receive
the
impersonal
introduction
that
her
father
gave
the
girl
looked
at
them
both
gravely
with
an
alert
watchfulness
of
the
stare
of
open
admiration
with
which
the
stranger
regarded
her
she
seemed
not
even
to
be
aware
though
friend
ruth
noticed
it
with
disapproval
dawn
took
the
chair
to
which
friend
ruth
motioned
her
at
some
distance
from
the
young
man
and
sat
demurely
waiting
her
eyes
wide
with
apprehension
her
father
asked
about
her
conduct
and
standing
in
the
school
but
no
flush
of
embarrassment
came
to
the
face
of
the
watching
girl
though
friend
ruth
gave
unwonted
praise
of
the
past
year
s
work
at
another
time
it
would
have
astonished
and
pleased
her
but
now
she
felt
it
was
a
mere
preliminary
to
the
real
object
of
her
father
s
visit
as
soon
as
there
came
a
break
in
the
conversation
the
stranger
took
a
part
admiring
the
location
of
the
school
and
saying
he
would
be
glad
if
he
might
look
about
the
place
as
he
had
a
friend
who
wished
to
send
his
daughter
away
to
school
somewhere
and
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
be
able
to
speak
in
detail
of
this
delightful
spot
was
there
a
view
of
the
hudson
from
this
point
indeed
perhaps
the
young
lady
would
be
so
kind
as
to
show
it
to
him
friend
ruth
hesitated
but
the
father
waved
a
command
to
his
daughter
frowning
she
arose
to
obey
she
felt
the
whole
thing
was
a
subterfuge
to
get
her
from
the
room
while
the
real
object
of
her
father
s
unexpected
visit
was
divulged
she
led
the
way
through
the
wide
hall
out
to
the
pillared
veranda
and
down
the
sloping
lawn
to
the
bluff
which
overlooked
the
river
where
plied
a
steamer
on
its
silver
course
apathetically
she
pointed
out
the
places
of
interest
she
scarcely
heard
her
companion
s
eager
attempts
at
conversation
he
noted
the
absent
look
in
her
dark
eyes
you
do
not
like
it
here
he
asked
letting
his
tone
become
gentle
in
coaxing
confidence
oh
yes
she
answered
quickly
with
a
flit
of
trouble
across
her
face
at
least
i
think
i
do
i
do
not
care
to
go
away
not
to
your
beautiful
home
he
asked
insinuatingly
and
your
mother
he
added
his
eyes
narrowing
to
observe
her
expression
more
closely
she
is
not
my
mother
answered
the
girl
coldly
and
became
at
once
reserved
as
if
she
were
sorry
for
having
spoken
so
plainly
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
i
did
not
know
murmured
the
stranger
making
mental
note
of
her
change
of
expression
suddenly
her
eyes
flashed
wide
upon
him
and
she
dashed
a
question
out
with
a
way
that
compelled
an
answer
has
my
father
come
to
take
me
home
do
you
know
oh
no
not
at
all
answered
the
young
man
suavely
he
was
delighted
to
have
found
this
key
to
her
thoughts
it
led
just
where
he
desired
we
are
merely
taking
a
business
trip
together
and
your
father
stopped
off
to
see
how
things
were
going
with
you
i
am
sure
i
am
delighted
that
he
did
for
it
has
given
me
great
pleasure
to
meet
you
why
asked
the
girl
lifting
relieved
eyes
to
his
face
in
mild
astonishment
he
gave
a
laugh
at
this
frank
way
of
meeting
him
now
surely
you
do
not
need
to
ask
me
that
he
said
looking
down
at
her
meaningly
his
eyes
gazing
into
the
innocent
ones
in
open
and
intimate
admiration
you
must
know
how
beautiful
you
are
with
a
startled
expression
she
searched
his
face
and
then
not
finding
it
pleasant
turned
away
with
a
look
resembling
her
father
in
its
sternness
i
don
t
think
that
is
a
nice
way
for
a
man
to
talk
to
a
girl
she
said
in
a
displeased
tone
i
am
too
big
to
be
spoken
to
in
that
way
i
am
past
sixteen
and
shall
be
done
school
next
year
he
dropped
the
offending
manner
at
once
and
begged
her
pardon
pleading
that
her
father
had
talked
of
her
as
a
child
he
asked
also
that
she
would
let
him
be
her
friend
for
he
felt
that
they
would
be
congenial
and
all
the
more
that
she
was
growing
into
womanhood
her
gravity
did
not
relax
however
and
her
eyes
searched
his
face
suspiciously
i
think
we
would
better
go
into
the
house
she
said
soberly
friend
ruth
will
not
like
my
staying
out
so
long
and
i
must
see
my
father
again
but
will
you
be
my
friend
he
insisted
as
they
turned
their
steps
toward
the
house
how
could
we
be
friends
you
are
not
in
the
school
and
i
never
go
away
besides
i
don
t
see
what
would
be
the
use
don
t
you
like
me
at
all
he
asked
putting
on
the
tone
which
had
turned
many
a
girl
s
head
why
i
don
t
know
you
even
a
little
bit
how
could
i
like
you
besides
why
should
i
answered
dawn
frankly
you
are
deliriously
she
caught
her
lip
between
her
teeth
in
a
vexed
way
why
would
he
persist
in
talking
to
her
as
if
she
were
a
child
there
now
i
have
vexed
you
again
he
said
pretending
to
be
much
dismayed
but
indeed
you
misunderstand
me
i
do
not
look
upon
you
as
a
child
at
all
many
a
girl
is
married
at
your
age
and
you
will
soon
be
a
lovely
woman
i
want
you
for
my
friend
are
you
not
willing
i
don
t
know
said
the
girl
bluntly
looking
troubled
i
should
have
to
think
about
it
and
i
don
t
see
why
i
should
i
shall
be
here
a
whole
year
yet
and
i
shall
never
see
you
i
wish
i
could
stay
here
always
she
ended
passionately
i
never
want
to
go
home
perhaps
you
will
not
need
to
go
there
he
said
insinuatingly
wondering
how
it
was
she
was
so
different
from
other
girls
she
did
not
seem
to
understand
coquetry
her
eyes
met
his
now
in
mild
question
you
may
marry
and
have
a
home
of
your
own
he
answered
her
unspoken
question
a
startled
expression
came
into
her
eyes
oh
no
she
said
quickly
i
don
t
think
that
will
ever
happen
i
don
t
want
that
to
happen
and
she
drew
away
from
him
as
if
the
thought
frightened
her
married
people
are
not
happy
nonsense
said
the
young
man
gayly
he
had
planted
the
seed
in
what
looked
like
fallow
ground
and
perhaps
one
day
it
would
blossom
for
him
there
are
plenty
of
happy
married
people
i
ve
a
good
old
father
and
mother
who
just
worship
each
other
they
ve
been
happy
as
clams
all
their
lives
and
i
know
a
great
many
more
my
father
and
mother
were
not
happy
said
dawn
gravely
friend
ruth
and
friend
isaac
do
not
seem
to
be
very
happy
either
though
of
course
this
isn
t
a
real
home
but
they
are
never
cross
she
added
in
conscientious
explanation
if
you
were
married
you
could
have
a
real
home
of
your
own
and
have
things
just
as
you
wanted
them
the
young
man
remarked
cunningly
that
would
be
nice
said
the
girl
thoughtfully
i
should
like
that
part
but
i
think
i
would
like
it
better
without
being
married
there
are
father
and
friend
ruth
looking
for
us
let
us
hurry
but
you
have
not
told
me
whether
you
will
let
me
be
your
friend
he
said
detaining
her
under
a
great
elm
tree
and
looking
off
toward
the
river
as
if
he
were
still
watching
the
steamer
if
you
will
let
me
be
your
friend
i
will
get
permission
to
come
and
see
you
now
and
then
and
i
will
bring
you
a
box
of
sweets
you
will
like
that
won
t
you
all
girls
are
fond
of
sweets
i
don
t
know
answered
dawn
slowly
looking
at
him
with
troubled
eyes
and
wondering
why
it
was
that
his
eyes
reminded
her
of
a
fish
the
other
girls
would
like
the
sweets
he
suggested
could
i
give
them
away
she
asked
with
a
flash
of
interest
you
may
do
anything
you
like
with
them
he
responded
eagerly
so
it
is
all
settled
then
and
i
may
be
your
friend
i
don
t
know
said
dawn
again
i
suppose
it
will
have
to
be
as
father
and
friend
ruth
say
no
need
to
consult
them
in
the
matter
leave
that
to
me
all
i
want
is
your
consent
remember
i
am
going
to
visit
you
next
month
and
bring
you
something
nice
but
by
this
time
the
others
had
reached
them
charming
view
van
rensselaer
i
had
no
idea
you
could
see
new
york
so
plainly
from
this
point
said
the
young
man
dawn
stepped
over
and
stood
beside
friend
ruth
looking
thoughtfully
down
the
river
she
would
like
the
box
of
confections
well
enough
for
not
many
sweets
were
allowed
at
the
school
and
they
could
have
a
treat
down
in
the
woods
beside
the
brook
but
somehow
she
had
a
vague
uneasiness
about
this
friendship
she
did
not
like
the
stranger
s
face
her
father
and
the
other
man
went
away
after
the
noonday
meal
the
stranger
s
name
she
learned
was
harrington
winthrop
and
that
he
was
interested
in
a
business
enterprise
with
her
father
the
matter
passed
entirely
from
her
mind
only
after
that
when
she
sat
alone
to
brood
over
her
life
a
new
dream
took
the
place
of
the
old
always
there
was
a
lovely
home
all
her
own
with
comfortable
chairs
and
plenty
of
books
and
thin
sprigged
china
such
as
had
been
her
mother
s
in
this
home
she
was
sole
mistress
day
by
day
she
dreamed
out
the
pretty
rooms
and
dwelt
in
them
and
even
occasionally
let
her
imagination
people
them
the
image
of
her
beautiful
mother
hovered
about
that
home
and
stayed
but
there
came
into
it
no
one
to
annoy
or
disturb
when
the
two
men
settled
themselves
in
the
stage
that
night
the
younger
began
to
talk
do
you
know
you
have
a
very
beautiful
daughter
van
rensselaer
the
father
started
from
the
reverie
into
which
he
had
fallen
the
look
of
the
moonlight
was
reminding
him
of
a
night
over
sixteen
years
ago
when
he
and
mary
had
taken
this
same
stage
trip
strange
he
could
not
get
away
from
the
thought
of
it
ah
yes
it
had
been
the
look
of
his
daughter
that
had
brought
back
mary
s
face
for
the
girl
was
grown
to
be
the
image
of
her
mother
save
for
a
certain
sad
flitting
of
severity
in
the
moonlight
outside
the
coach
he
seemed
to
see
again
the
sweet
face
in
the
coffin
and
he
compared
it
with
the
warm
living
face
of
the
girl
whom
he
had
been
to
see
that
day
he
knew
that
between
his
daughter
and
him
was
an
impenetrable
barrier
that
could
never
be
removed
and
the
thought
of
it
pierced
his
soul
as
it
never
had
before
a
great
yearning
and
pity
for
his
motherless
fatherless
girl
had
come
into
his
cold
empty
heart
as
he
had
watched
her
move
silently
about
but
ever
present
was
the
thought
that
he
had
no
right
in
her
either
no
matter
how
much
he
might
try
no
one
would
have
suspected
him
of
such
feelings
he
hid
them
deep
under
his
grim
and
brilliant
exterior
sternly
in
any
situation
but
now
in
the
a
new
thought
came
into
his
mind
and
he
started
and
gave
his
attention
to
the
words
of
his
companion
is
she
your
only
child
the
question
made
him
start
again
there
was
a
long
pause
so
long
that
harrington
winthrop
thought
he
had
not
been
heard
then
a
husky
voice
answered
out
of
the
shadows
of
the
coach
no
there
was
little
boy
he
died
soon
after
his
mother
outside
in
the
moonlight
the
vision
of
a
boy
rode
in
a
wreath
of
mist
the
words
were
the
man
s
acknowledgment
to
the
two
who
ever
attended
him
now
through
life
he
did
not
wish
to
give
his
confidence
to
this
business
companion
ah
then
this
beautiful
young
woman
will
likely
be
sole
heir
to
the
van
rensselaer
estate
said
the
young
man
to
himself
rejoicing
inwardly
at
the
ease
with
which
he
was
obtaining
information
there
was
silence
in
the
coach
while
winthrop
pondered
the
great
discovery
he
had
made
and
how
he
should
act
upon
it
but
the
elder
man
was
lost
in
gloomy
thoughts
he
had
a
vague
feeling
that
mary
out
there
in
the
moonlight
with
her
boy
would
hold
him
to
account
for
the
little
girl
she
had
loved
and
lost
in
life
a
sudden
glimpse
into
the
future
had
been
given
him
partly
by
the
young
man
s
words
partly
by
the
beauty
of
dawn
herself
she
was
blossoming
into
womanhood
and
with
that
change
would
come
new
perplexities
she
could
not
stay
always
at
the
school
where
in
the
world
was
there
a
place
for
his
child
more
and
more
he
saw
that
the
woman
whom
in
the
fierceness
of
his
wrath
he
had
selected
to
take
the
place
of
mother
to
the
girl
was
both
unable
and
unwilling
to
do
so
he
shrank
from
the
time
when
his
daughter
would
have
to
come
home
as
he
thought
of
it
it
seemed
an
impossible
situation
to
have
her
there
it
would
be
almost
like
having
mary
in
the
flesh
to
live
with
them
with
reproachful
eyes
ever
upon
their
smallest
acts
at
that
moment
it
came
to
him
that
he
was
enduring
the
torments
of
a
lost
soul
his
conscience
having
sat
in
judgment
and
condemned
him
the
rumbled
on
stopping
now
and
again
through
the
night
for
a
change
of
horses
and
the
two
who
sat
within
its
gloomy
depths
said
little
to
each
other
yet
slept
not
for
one
was
musing
on
the
evil
of
the
past
and
its
results
while
the
other
was
plotting
evil
for
the
future

harrington
winthrop
kept
his
promise
about
the
sweets
five
times
during
the
winter
that
followed
his
first
visit
with
van
rensselaer
he
invented
some
excuse
to
visit
dawn
the
first
time
he
came
he
found
her
in
the
maple
grove
behind
the
pasture
with
a
group
of
other
girls
all
decked
in
autumn
leaves
and
playing
out
some
story
that
dawn
had
read
he
persuaded
her
to
walk
a
little
way
into
the
woods
with
him
and
when
he
came
to
take
his
leave
asked
for
a
kiss
but
dawn
sprang
away
from
him
in
sudden
panic
no
she
said
sharply
i
have
never
kissed
anybody
but
my
mother
then
fearing
she
had
been
impolite
in
view
of
his
gift
she
added
we
don
t
kiss
people
here
at
this
school
it
isn
t
the
custom
and
she
knew
so
little
of
the
customs
of
the
world
that
the
incident
passed
without
further
apprehension
on
her
part
or
understanding
of
the
young
man
s
meaning
that
s
all
right
my
dear
he
said
pleasantly
but
don
t
forget
about
the
house
i
m
going
to
tell
you
all
about
it
next
time
i
come
you
still
want
a
home
of
your
very
own
don
t
you
why
of
course
said
dawn
but
i
can
t
see
how
you
can
know
anything
about
it
or
care
what
have
you
to
do
with
it
and
then
with
sudden
alarm
has
my
father
been
talking
to
you
about
any
such
thing
no
indeed
your
father
does
not
even
know
i
am
interested
in
you
i
care
for
my
own
sake
didn
t
i
tell
you
that
i
liked
you
the
minute
i
saw
you
and
i
m
just
as
interested
in
this
future
home
of
yours
as
you
are
i
m
sure
i
can
t
see
why
said
dawn
perplexed
yet
trying
to
be
polite
suppose
you
think
about
it
hard
dear
and
see
if
you
can
find
out
why
i
care
just
think
it
all
over
everything
i
have
said
and
then
if
you
are
still
in
doubt
go
and
look
in
the
and
keep
on
thinking
and
i
m
sure
you
ll
find
out
by
the
time
i
come
back
i
m
coming
soon
again
and
i
want
you
to
be
watching
for
me
every
day
i
ll
bring
you
something
nice
next
time
besides
another
box
of
sweets
dawn
tried
to
smile
but
felt
uncomfortable
she
murmured
her
thanks
again
and
turned
uneasily
toward
the
woods
and
her
companions
and
he
deemed
it
prudent
to
leave
her
without
further
ado
back
in
the
woods
the
girls
were
making
merry
with
her
confections
and
had
nothing
but
praise
for
the
handsome
stranger
who
had
brought
them
but
all
through
the
eager
questions
and
merry
jibes
dawn
was
silent
and
thoughtful
where
are
your
thoughts
dawn
said
desire
hathaway
has
the
stranger
stolen
them
away
to
pay
for
his
goodies
she
looks
as
if
he
had
asked
her
to
marry
him
and
she
didn
t
know
whether
to
say
yes
or
to
wait
for
somebody
else
laughed
matilda
hale
a
among
them
and
older
than
the
rest
i
guess
he
kissed
her
chimed
in
silly
polly
phelps
who
aspired
to
be
matilda
s
shadow
i
peeked
through
the
bushes
and
saw
him
bending
over
her
amid
the
thoughtless
laugh
that
rose
dawn
stood
defiant
the
crimson
leaping
into
her
cheeks
the
steel
into
her
eyes
for
an
instant
she
looked
as
if
she
would
turn
upon
the
offending
matilda
and
tear
her
to
pieces
then
a
sudden
revelation
came
to
her
this
this
was
what
the
handsome
stranger
had
meant
instantly
the
light
of
anger
died
out
of
her
face
and
a
gentle
dignity
took
its
place
her
little
clenched
hands
relaxed
the
tenseness
of
the
graceful
body
softened
and
she
turned
toward
the
offender
with
a
haughty
condescension
matilda
we
don
t
talk
in
that
way
here
she
said
and
the
laughter
died
out
of
the
faces
of
her
companions
and
left
instead
amazement
and
admiration
they
had
seen
dawn
angry
before
and
had
not
expected
the
affair
to
end
so
amicably
they
felt
it
showed
a
marvellous
and
left
her
mistress
of
the
situation
matilda
bit
her
lip
in
a
vexed
way
and
tossed
her
head
she
felt
she
had
lost
prestige
by
the
little
incident
and
dawn
was
still
the
recognized
leader
of
the
school
it
was
not
a
pleasant
thought
to
the
older
girl
dawn
turned
and
walked
slowly
away
from
them
all
out
of
the
woods
down
through
the
meadow
where
grazed
her
quiet
friends
the
sheep
she
still
carried
her
gentle
dignity
and
none
of
the
girls
spoke
until
she
was
out
of
sight
behind
the
group
of
chestnuts
at
the
corner
of
the
meadow
then
desire
hathaway
voiced
the
general
feeling
isn
t
she
just
like
a
queen
oh
if
you
want
to
look
at
it
that
way
sneered
matilda
with
another
toss
of
her
head
there
are
a
good
many
kinds
of
queens
you
know
i
must
say
i
thought
she
looked
like
a
pretty
wicked
one
for
a
minute
or
two
she
would
have
enjoyed
tearing
my
eyes
out
if
she
had
dared
dared
cried
desire
you
don
t
know
her
she
will
dare
anything
that
she
thinks
is
worth
while
i
thought
it
was
just
splendid
the
way
she
controlled
herself
oh
well
just
as
you
think
of
course
shrugged
matilda
come
on
polly
let
s
go
finish
our
sewing
dawn
stumbled
on
blindly
in
the
pasture
trying
to
take
in
the
appalling
thought
that
the
young
man
wanted
to
marry
her
tears
of
indignation
welled
into
her
eyes
but
she
brushed
them
angrily
aside
why
was
life
so
dreadful
she
wondered
why
did
men
exist
to
break
women
s
hearts
she
never
doubted
that
the
married
state
was
one
of
such
had
been
the
lesson
burned
deep
into
her
soul
by
suffering
a
home
of
her
own
had
been
a
sweet
thought
but
the
serpent
had
entered
her
eden
and
she
cared
no
more
to
stay
there
the
next
time
winthrop
came
it
was
openly
with
a
message
from
her
father
all
through
the
interview
which
lasted
for
an
hour
and
was
prolonged
over
the
noonday
meal
dawn
sat
stiffly
on
the
other
side
of
friend
ruth
watching
the
fishy
eyes
of
the
stranger
and
listening
to
his
fulsome
flatteries
of
the
place
her
small
hands
folded
decorously
but
her
young
heart
beating
painfully
under
the
sheer
folds
of
the
kerchief
on
his
fourth
visit
he
bore
a
private
letter
from
her
father
to
friend
ruth
and
wore
an
air
of
assurance
which
made
the
girl
s
heart
sink
with
nameless
foreboding
not
even
the
praises
of
the
girls
for
her
handsome
lover
their
open
envy
of
her
future
lot
or
their
merry
taunts
could
rouse
her
from
a
gravity
which
had
begun
to
settle
upon
her
this
time
friend
ruth
seemed
to
look
upon
the
visitor
in
a
different
light
not
only
was
dawn
allowed
to
talk
with
him
alone
but
she
was
sent
out
with
him
for
a
walk
in
the
woods
reluctantly
she
obeyed
frightened
she
knew
not
why
harrington
winthrop
had
a
winning
way
with
him
and
he
was
determined
to
win
this
proud
beautiful
girl
also
he
was
wise
in
the
ways
of
the
world
he
did
not
force
any
undue
attention
upon
her
but
confined
his
conversation
to
telling
her
about
the
beautiful
home
he
had
seen
rightly
guessing
that
there
was
still
much
of
the
child
about
her
he
went
on
to
picture
the
house
in
detail
not
hesitating
to
embellish
it
at
will
where
his
memory
failed
there
was
a
garden
with
a
fountain
and
there
should
be
flowers
all
in
profusion
there
were
clipped
hedges
gravel
paths
an
arbor
in
a
shady
place
where
she
might
bring
her
book
or
sewing
and
where
the
sunshine
would
peer
through
the
branches
just
enough
to
scatter
gold
about
the
leafy
way
in
spite
of
her
prejudices
she
was
interested
she
could
not
help
it
the
longing
for
a
real
home
of
her
own
was
great
then
came
the
most
difficult
part
of
his
task
which
was
to
reconcile
her
to
himself
skilfully
he
led
the
conversation
about
till
he
himself
was
the
life
since
he
had
become
a
man
and
gone
out
into
the
world
pathetically
he
talked
of
his
own
loneliness
until
he
touched
the
maternal
chord
in
her
nature
and
made
her
feel
sorry
for
him
he
opened
up
for
her
gaze
depths
of
sympathy
tenderness
and
pathos
which
were
purely
imaginary
and
wholly
impossible
to
his
own
nature
he
launched
into
details
of
his
own
feelings
which
were
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
because
he
saw
they
touched
her
he
told
her
how
he
had
often
been
lonely
almost
to
desperation
and
how
he
had
many
and
many
a
time
pictured
a
home
of
his
own
with
a
lovely
wife
at
its
head
the
girl
winced
at
the
name
wife
but
he
went
steadily
on
trying
to
take
the
strangeness
out
of
the
word
trying
to
touch
her
heart
and
fire
her
tenderness
for
he
rightly
read
the
possibilities
of
love
in
the
beautiful
face
and
it
put
him
on
his
mettle
to
make
it
bloom
for
him
he
succeeded
so
far
as
to
make
her
conscience
sharply
reprove
her
for
the
dislike
she
had
for
him
of
course
if
he
had
been
lonely
too
and
had
had
a
care
for
her
loneliness
it
was
a
different
matter
perhaps
after
all
they
had
something
in
common
and
he
would
not
be
such
a
dreadful
addition
to
the
home
she
had
longed
for
at
least
she
had
no
right
to
shut
him
out
of
a
dream
that
he
held
in
common
with
her
and
she
tried
to
put
aside
her
own
feelings
and
look
at
him
fairly
so
they
walked
the
deeper
into
the
woods
and
while
she
did
not
say
much
in
reply
to
his
eloquent
words
she
did
not
seem
actively
opposed
he
let
his
voice
grow
more
and
more
tender
though
he
did
not
trouble
her
with
words
of
love
he
let
a
care
for
her
become
apparent
as
they
walked
over
the
rough
growth
in
the
woods
he
held
the
branches
aside
for
her
and
helped
her
over
a
log
and
once
across
the
stones
of
a
little
brook
touching
her
hand
and
arm
deferentially
it
did
not
appeal
to
dawn
in
the
way
he
hoped
that
it
would
nor
awaken
any
tenderness
for
him
but
she
let
him
lead
her
along
a
path
which
had
she
been
alone
she
would
have
cleared
at
a
bound
and
counted
an
easy
thing
when
he
parted
from
her
that
evening
to
take
the
night
boat
he
gave
her
shrinking
fingers
a
slight
pressure
in
token
of
the
understanding
between
them
and
dawn
understood
it
as
the
sealing
of
a
kind
of
unspoken
contract
after
that
dawn
was
not
surprised
to
receive
a
letter
from
her
father
in
which
he
spoke
of
the
young
man
s
desire
to
make
her
his
wife
and
formally
gave
his
consent
it
never
seemed
to
occur
to
him
that
the
girl
might
have
any
question
about
the
matter
a
dull
kind
of
rebellion
rose
in
her
breast
and
smouldered
there
as
she
read
her
father
s
letter
yet
she
accepted
his
arrangements
for
her
life
because
it
seemed
the
only
way
out
from
a
home
that
could
never
be
a
happy
one
for
her
and
because
it
offered
a
spot
that
might
be
called
her
own
and
a
possible
opportunity
to
live
out
some
of
her
childish
dreams
when
harrington
winthrop
came
again
she
no
longer
yielded
to
her
inward
shrinking
from
him
but
took
him
as
she
took
hard
tasks
that
she
did
not
like
but
that
were
inevitable
and
he
finding
her
unresisting
was
careful
not
to
do
anything
to
mar
the
pleasant
understanding
between
them
meantime
he
congratulated
himself
constantly
upon
the
ease
with
which
he
had
possessed
himself
of
a
promised
wife
whose
private
fortune
would
be
no
small
one
chapter
iv
dawn
settled
into
a
gravity
that
was
premature
she
counted
every
day
of
her
precious
school
year
as
if
it
had
been
a
priceless
treasure
that
was
slipping
from
her
there
were
times
when
she
roused
to
her
old
self
again
and
plunged
madly
into
fun
leading
her
companions
into
wild
amusements
that
they
would
never
have
originated
by
themselves
then
again
she
would
sober
down
and
they
could
get
her
to
say
very
little
it
began
to
be
whispered
about
that
she
was
to
be
married
when
she
had
finished
school
and
the
girls
all
looked
at
her
with
a
kind
of
envying
awe
thus
the
winter
passed
and
the
spring
came
on
the
spring
that
was
to
be
her
last
at
school
the
first
few
days
of
warm
weather
she
spent
exploring
old
haunts
watching
for
the
spring
blossoms
and
reverently
touching
the
green
moss
hunting
anemones
hepaticas
and
violets
then
as
if
she
could
stand
her
own
thoughts
no
longer
she
suddenly
proposed
the
acting
of
another
play
it
was
the
first
since
that
time
in
the
autumn
when
harrington
winthrop
broke
in
upon
them
and
they
had
never
been
able
to
induce
her
to
finish
it
now
she
selected
another
one
that
seemed
to
her
to
have
the
very
heart
of
spring
and
life
bound
up
in
it
she
got
it
out
of
an
old
book
which
had
been
her
mother
tales
of
william
shakespeare
by
name
it
was
not
used
as
a
in
the
excellent
school
of
friend
ruth
and
friend
isaac
and
the
child
had
always
kept
it
safely
hidden
the
play
she
had
selected
had
many
elves
and
sprites
of
the
air
in
it
dawn
drilled
her
willing
subjects
and
rehearsed
them
until
at
last
she
felt
they
were
ready
for
the
final
presentation
the
scene
of
the
play
was
to
be
on
the
sloping
hillside
just
above
the
meadow
where
the
maples
on
the
hill
were
flanked
by
a
thicket
of
elderberry
bushes
that
did
double
duty
of
background
and
screen
for
the
the
audience
of
girls
was
seated
in
breathless
silence
augmented
by
a
group
of
kindly
cows
and
stupid
sheep
who
stood
in
patient
rows
and
waited
mildly
for
any
tender
bites
or
chance
blossoms
of
cowslips
the
girls
might
put
between
the
bars
of
the
fence
now
and
then
as
the
play
went
on
they
lifted
calm
eyes
of
bewilderment
over
the
turbulent
scenes
in
the
mimic
or
out
of
their
placid
world
of
monotonous
duty
wondered
whatever
the
children
could
be
at
now
it
chanced
that
day
that
harrington
winthrop
was
passing
and
most
unexpectedly
he
had
with
him
his
younger
brother
who
was
on
his
way
back
to
harvard
college
after
a
brief
visit
home
to
see
his
mother
who
had
been
charles
winthrop
had
met
his
elder
brother
in
the
coach
and
had
boyishly
insisted
on
accompanying
him
when
he
stopped
on
what
he
professed
was
a
friendly
errand
at
this
school
charles
had
long
been
separated
from
his
brother
and
wanted
to
talk
over
old
days
and
ask
many
questions
for
harrington
had
been
away
from
home
most
of
the
time
for
nearly
ten
years
and
had
travelled
in
the
west
and
the
south
a
great
deal
which
seemed
a
charmed
country
to
the
younger
man
now
harrington
had
not
been
anxious
for
company
on
this
visit
but
he
could
not
well
shake
his
brother
off
without
arousing
suspicions
therefore
as
they
neared
the
school
he
told
him
that
he
was
about
to
visit
the
girl
whom
he
expected
in
a
few
months
to
make
his
wife
charles
in
his
hearty
boyish
way
congratulated
him
and
expressed
a
desire
to
see
the
girl
who
was
his
brother
s
choice
they
were
told
at
the
house
that
dawn
was
out
with
the
other
girls
in
the
meadows
and
so
went
in
search
of
her
they
arrived
on
the
scene
just
as
the
closing
act
was
about
to
begin
the
little
company
of
players
stood
out
bravely
in
costumes
designed
entirely
by
dawn
the
outfit
of
the
school
was
far
too
sombre
to
play
any
part
in
the
gaiety
of
the
occasion
an
occasional
patchwork
quilt
had
been
pressed
into
service
and
one
or
two
gray
or
scarlet
blankets
but
most
of
the
players
were
dressed
in
white
literally
covered
with
flowers
or
green
leaves
the
two
young
men
skirted
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
came
upon
the
scene
just
when
dawn
as
queen
of
the
air
attended
by
her
sprites
and
nymphs
came
into
view
with
a
gentle
gliding
run
learned
surely
from
the
birds
for
nowhere
else
could
such
grace
be
found
she
was
clad
in
white
drapery
of
homespun
linen
one
of
her
own
mother
s
finest
sheets
it
was
drawn
about
her
slender
form
over
her
shoulders
in
a
fashion
all
her
own
though
graceful
as
any
greek
goddess
her
white
throat
and
round
white
arms
were
bare
the
long
dark
curls
had
been
set
free
and
about
her
brow
was
a
wreath
of
exquisite
blossoms
whose
delicate
tinting
matched
the
rose
of
her
cheeks
about
her
throat
arms
wrists
and
her
feet
were
chains
of
the
same
blossoms
here
and
there
the
white
drapery
of
her
garment
which
fell
half
way
from
the
knee
to
the
ankle
was
fastened
with
a
spray
of
blossoms
it
was
a
daring
costume
for
a
maiden
to
don
and
she
knew
it
but
she
expected
no
eyes
to
look
upon
her
save
her
companions
and
the
friendly
cattle
she
stood
poised
on
the
green
slope
holding
in
her
hands
and
high
above
her
head
a
soft
scarf
of
old
curtain
which
she
had
saved
from
the
and
wet
and
stretched
in
the
sun
till
it
was
soft
and
pliable
she
had
mended
it
and
fastened
the
darns
with
blossoms
and
edged
it
also
with
blossoms
plucked
close
from
the
stem
and
sewed
down
in
a
fine
flat
border
behind
her
came
her
maidens
their
garments
sewed
over
with
maple
leaves
tender
and
green
and
fluttering
they
were
crowned
and
wreathed
also
with
maple
leaves
and
made
a
beautiful
setting
for
dawn
s
delicate
beauty
then
down
the
hillside
they
came
the
maidens
with
festoons
of
leaves
fastened
together
by
their
stems
which
they
held
aloft
as
their
leader
held
her
scarf
they
sang
a
strange
sweet
song
that
had
in
it
the
wildness
of
the
thrush
s
song
the
sweetness
of
the
robin
s
it
was
dawn
who
had
composed
the
melody
and
taught
it
to
them
she
had
learned
it
from
the
birds
and
interpreted
old
shakespeare
s
words
they
sang
it
as
the
zephyrs
sing
the
little
audience
sat
with
bated
breath
the
old
cows
chewed
their
cud
thoughtfully
one
with
soft
eyes
heaved
a
long
sigh
marvelling
on
the
ways
of
the
world
the
two
strangers
stood
entranced
and
astonished
but
the
heart
of
one
of
them
thrilled
with
a
strange
new
joy
charles
winthrop
saw
only
the
beautiful
face
of
dawn
van
rensselaer
all
the
rest
were
but
a
setting
for
her
he
seemed
to
know
instantly
as
he
looked
that
there
was
no
other
girl
in
the
world
like
this
he
knew
not
who
she
might
be
but
he
looked
at
her
as
if
his
spirit
were
calling
to
hers
across
the
that
separated
them
then
suddenly
half
poised
as
she
was
in
the
very
midst
of
her
song
dawn
became
aware
of
his
presence
and
stopped
she
met
his
gaze
and
without
her
own
volition
it
seemed
her
eyes
were
shining
and
smiling
to
meet
his
smile
it
was
just
a
fleeting
instant
that
they
gazed
thus
and
then
the
joy
went
out
of
the
girl
s
face
and
a
frightened
look
took
its
place
she
had
seen
the
other
man
standing
beside
him
and
he
was
frowning
harrington
winthrop
had
caught
the
look
on
his
brother
s
face
and
its
answer
in
the
face
of
the
girl
upon
whom
he
had
set
his
seal
of
possession
and
an
unreasoning
anger
had
taken
possession
of
him
this
girl
had
looked
at
charles
as
harrington
had
never
been
able
to
make
her
look
at
him
not
even
since
she
had
in
a
tacit
way
consented
to
marry
him
this
is
foolish
child
s
play
he
said
in
a
vexed
tone
to
his
brother
let
us
go
back
to
the
house
and
wait
until
she
has
returned
oh
no
let
us
stay
said
charles
this
is
beautiful
exquisite
at
least
if
you
must
go
let
me
stay
i
wish
to
see
the
finish
i
wish
you
to
go
said
harrington
and
there
was
something
in
his
brother
s
voice
that
reminded
charles
of
the
days
when
he
used
to
be
ordered
back
from
following
on
a
fishing
or
swimming
expedition
he
looked
at
his
brother
s
angry
face
and
then
back
to
the
beautiful
girl
on
the
hillside
but
the
light
had
gone
out
of
her
eyes
the
song
had
died
on
her
lips
there
was
no
sparkling
smile
now
instead
there
was
an
angry
flash
in
the
eyes
she
held
the
fluttering
scarf
in
front
of
her
now
in
long
loose
folds
covering
her
feet
and
ankles
and
as
the
two
men
turned
and
gazed
at
her
her
head
went
up
proudly
even
as
the
queen
of
the
air
might
have
raised
her
head
one
hand
went
up
in
quick
command
pointing
straight
at
the
two
young
men
and
in
quite
the
phrase
of
the
play
she
had
been
acting
she
spoke
hence
strange
spirits
she
cried
hence
begone
ye
have
no
right
amongst
us
being
unbidden
go
i
tell
ye
go
or
i
the
queen
of
the
air
will
bring
evil
upon
ye
go
ye
have
angered
me
dawn
had
made
shakespeare
so
much
her
constant
companion
that
the
language
came
easily
to
her
she
picked
up
phrases
here
and
there
and
strung
them
together
without
hesitation
her
anger
helped
her
on
and
her
splendid
command
of
herself
had
a
strange
effect
upon
her
audience
the
other
girls
listened
in
wonder
that
dawn
should
dare
to
speak
before
these
strangers
and
not
be
covered
with
confusion
almost
they
thought
it
was
part
of
the
play
but
the
two
to
whom
she
spoke
turned
and
obeyed
her
command
the
one
because
he
was
angry
and
wished
to
get
his
brother
away
the
other
because
there
had
been
a
certain
appeal
in
her
lovely
eyes
which
had
reached
his
soul
and
made
him
bow
in
reverence
to
her
command
then
all
at
once
as
he
turned
away
he
knew
that
she
was
the
girl
whom
his
brother
intended
to
make
his
wife
and
a
great
sadness
and
sense
of
a
loss
came
over
him
there
was
mutiny
in
her
eyes
as
dawn
came
back
to
the
house
a
little
later
and
greeted
her
lover
with
a
haughty
manner
he
had
managed
it
that
charles
should
sit
alone
in
the
gray
parlor
and
wait
while
he
met
the
girl
out
in
the
entrance
to
the
orchard
and
walked
away
with
her
to
a
sheltered
place
overlooking
the
river
there
was
no
hint
of
the
queen
of
the
air
in
her
demure
dress
the
curls
the
small
prunella
slippers
that
peered
from
under
the
deep
hem
of
her
gray
gown
but
her
bearing
was
queenly
as
she
waited
for
him
to
speak
he
saw
that
he
was
treading
on
dangerous
ground
do
you
really
like
such
childish
play
he
asked
a
trifle
contemptuously
you
had
no
right
to
come
there
she
flashed
if
you
did
not
like
it
you
should
have
gone
away
he
was
disconcerted
he
did
not
wish
to
anger
her
for
he
had
come
for
another
purpose
well
never
mind
if
you
enjoyed
yourself
i
suppose
it
does
not
matter
whether
i
liked
it
or
not
let
us
talk
of
something
else
your
are
almost
over
you
will
soon
begin
to
live
real
life
she
looked
at
him
and
felt
that
she
came
near
to
hating
him
a
sudden
unspeakable
terror
seized
her
she
let
him
talk
on
about
the
house
they
were
to
have
and
tried
to
remember
that
he
was
lonesome
and
wanted
a
home
as
badly
as
she
did
but
somehow
she
felt
nothing
but
fear
and
dislike
so
though
she
walked
by
his
side
she
heard
little
of
what
he
said
only
saying
when
he
asked
if
she
wished
this
or
that
i
suppose
so
i
suppose
it
will
be
as
you
like
as
they
came
back
to
the
house
again
she
asked
him
suddenly
who
was
the
young
man
with
you
the
frown
came
into
his
face
again
why
do
you
ask
he
asked
sharply
he
did
not
feel
the
way
you
did
about
us
out
there
on
the
hill
how
do
you
know
he
watched
her
keenly
but
her
face
told
him
nothing
i
saw
it
in
his
eyes
she
said
quietly
and
without
more
words
went
into
the
house
and
up
to
her
room
dawn
stood
at
the
little
window
of
her
room
and
watched
the
two
men
go
down
the
path
from
the
door
through
the
small
panes
her
eyes
followed
them
until
they
were
out
of
sight
and
her
heart
swelled
with
thoughts
strange
and
new
and
fearful
how
could
she
go
and
live
with
this
man
who
had
frowned
at
her
innocent
happiness
would
he
not
be
worse
than
the
woman
who
had
taken
her
dear
mother
s
place
and
how
could
he
be
so
cruel
as
to
look
at
her
in
that
way
it
was
the
look
she
remembered
on
her
father
s
face
the
day
he
sent
her
mother
away
it
was
the
cruelty
of
men
perhaps
they
could
not
help
it
perhaps
god
made
them
so
but
that
other
one
had
been
different
he
had
understood
and
smiled
her
heart
leaped
out
toward
him
as
she
remembered
his
look
was
it
because
he
was
young
she
wondered
that
he
had
understood
he
had
seemed
far
younger
than
his
companion
yet
there
had
been
something
fine
and
manly
in
his
face
in
the
broadness
of
his
shoulders
and
the
set
of
his
head
as
he
walked
down
the
path
away
from
the
house
perhaps
when
he
was
older
he
would
grow
that
way
to
and
not
understand
any
more
she
sighed
and
dropped
her
face
against
the
glass
and
now
that
they
were
out
of
sight
the
haughty
look
melted
into
tears
chapter
v
the
day
that
dawn
left
school
to
go
back
to
her
home
was
one
long
agony
to
her
all
the
other
girls
were
happy
in
the
thought
of
some
of
them
looking
forward
to
returning
for
another
year
others
to
entering
into
a
bright
girlhood
filled
with
gaieties
but
to
dawn
it
meant
going
into
the
gray
of
a
looming
fate
where
never
again
would
she
be
happy
never
again
free
ever
since
the
day
of
the
play
when
she
had
seen
her
future
husband
frown
she
had
looked
forward
to
her
marriage
with
terror
he
had
not
come
after
that
but
instead
wrote
her
long
letters
full
of
plans
about
the
house
that
they
were
to
occupy
the
letters
impressed
that
thought
most
deeply
and
made
the
whole
hateful
to
her
it
grew
to
seem
that
it
was
house
and
she
would
be
his
prisoner
in
it
yet
somehow
he
had
succeeded
in
impressing
her
with
the
feeling
that
she
was
pledged
to
him
in
sacred
honor
and
that
it
would
be
a
dreadful
thing
to
break
a
tie
like
that
this
was
made
stronger
by
her
father
s
letters
which
now
grew
more
frequent
as
if
he
sought
to
atone
to
his
motherless
child
for
the
wrong
he
had
done
her
just
the
day
before
her
there
came
one
of
these
letters
in
which
he
told
her
that
everything
had
been
prepared
for
her
marriage
to
take
place
within
a
week
after
her
arrival
he
told
her
of
the
trousseau
which
his
wife
had
prepared
for
her
which
was
as
elaborate
and
complete
as
such
an
outfit
could
be
for
one
of
her
station
in
life
he
also
spoke
about
the
dignity
of
her
origin
and
with
unwonted
elaboration
commended
her
judgment
in
selecting
so
old
and
so
fine
a
family
as
that
of
the
house
of
winthrop
with
which
to
ally
herself
he
added
that
it
would
have
pleased
her
mother
s
family
and
that
winthrop
was
one
of
his
oldest
and
most
valued
friends
somehow
that
letter
seemed
to
dawn
to
put
the
seal
of
finality
upon
her
fate
there
was
no
turning
back
now
just
as
her
father
used
to
compel
her
to
go
upstairs
alone
when
he
discovered
that
she
was
afraid
of
the
dark
so
she
felt
that
if
he
once
discovered
her
dislike
for
her
future
husband
he
would
but
hasten
the
marriage
and
be
in
league
with
her
husband
against
her
always
when
the
time
came
to
leave
the
school
she
clung
with
such
fervor
about
the
neck
of
the
impassive
friend
ruth
that
the
astonished
lady
almost
lost
her
breath
and
a
strange
wild
thrill
went
through
her
unmotherly
bosom
as
of
something
that
might
have
been
and
was
lost
she
looked
earnestly
down
into
the
beautiful
face
of
the
girl
who
had
so
often
defied
her
rules
and
saw
an
appeal
in
those
lovely
eyes
to
which
she
would
most
certainly
have
responded
had
she
understood
for
she
was
a
good
woman
and
always
sought
to
do
her
best
but
the
boat
left
at
once
and
clinging
arms
had
perforce
to
be
removed
once
on
the
deck
with
the
others
dawn
looked
back
at
friend
ruth
as
impassively
as
always
though
the
usually
calm
face
of
the
woman
searched
her
out
with
troubled
glance
still
wondering
what
had
come
over
her
wild
young
pupil
somehow
as
she
watched
the
steamer
plough
away
until
dawn
was
a
mere
blur
with
the
others
friend
ruth
could
not
help
being
glad
that
the
beautiful
dark
curls
had
never
been
cut
the
day
was
perfect
and
the
scenery
along
the
palisades
had
never
looked
more
beautiful
yet
dawn
saw
nothing
of
it
she
sat
by
the
rail
looking
gloomily
down
into
the
water
and
a
curious
fancy
seized
her
that
she
would
like
to
float
out
there
on
the
water
forever
and
get
away
from
life
then
she
began
to
consider
the
possibility
of
running
away
it
was
not
the
first
time
this
thought
had
entered
her
mind
the
week
before
she
left
the
school
she
had
thought
of
it
seriously
and
even
planned
the
route
but
always
at
night
there
had
come
that
fearful
dream
of
her
future
husband
following
her
and
bringing
her
home
to
a
punishment
she
had
almost
got
her
courage
up
to
the
point
of
deciding
to
disappear
in
the
crowd
at
albany
and
so
elude
the
people
with
whom
she
was
expected
to
journey
to
her
home
when
to
her
dismay
she
looked
down
at
the
where
they
were
stopping
a
few
miles
below
albany
and
saw
her
father
coming
on
board
the
boat
he
had
not
expected
to
be
able
to
meet
her
and
had
written
that
she
was
to
come
with
acquaintances
of
his
her
heart
stood
still
in
panic
and
for
a
moment
she
looked
wildly
at
the
rail
of
the
steamer
as
if
she
might
climb
over
and
escape
then
in
a
moment
her
father
had
seen
her
and
stood
beside
her
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
forehead
coldly
almost
shyly
this
startled
her
too
for
he
had
not
kissed
her
since
the
days
before
her
mother
was
sent
away
and
a
strange
sharp
pain
went
through
her
heart
a
pang
of
things
that
might
have
been
she
looked
up
in
wonder
she
did
not
know
how
like
her
dead
mother
she
had
grown
but
the
stern
face
was
cold
as
ever
and
his
voice
conveyed
no
smallest
part
of
the
emotion
he
felt
at
sight
of
her
lovely
face
he
talked
to
her
gravely
of
her
school
life
and
then
he
went
on
to
speak
of
the
winthrop
family
and
to
tell
her
in
detail
bits
of
its
history
calculated
to
make
her
understand
its
importance
dawn
listened
with
growing
alarm
at
the
thought
of
all
that
would
be
expected
of
her
yet
not
a
breath
of
her
trouble
did
she
allow
her
father
to
see
it
might
have
made
a
difference
if
she
could
have
known
how
her
father
s
heart
was
aching
with
the
anguish
of
his
great
mistake
and
perhaps
if
the
father
could
have
known
the
breaking
of
the
young
heart
it
might
have
melted
the
coldness
of
his
reserve
and
brought
some
sympathy
to
the
surface
but
they
could
not
see
and
the
agony
went
on
dawn
walked
sadly
reluctantly
into
the
unloved
unloving
home
as
the
days
dragged
by
she
grew
to
have
a
haunted
look
and
the
rose
flush
on
her
sweet
round
cheek
faded
to
a
marble
white
while
under
her
eyes
were
dark
circles
her
father
saw
the
look
but
knew
not
what
it
meant
yet
it
pierced
his
soul
for
it
was
the
same
look
that
her
mother
had
worn
in
her
coffin
and
he
was
the
readier
to
have
the
marriage
hastened
both
for
her
sake
and
his
own
for
he
realized
she
was
not
happy
here
in
the
home
where
there
was
so
much
to
remind
her
of
what
had
passed
he
felt
she
never
would
forgive
him
and
that
her
only
hope
was
to
be
happily
married
winthrop
had
so
represented
her
feelings
to
him
that
he
had
taken
it
for
granted
she
was
only
too
eager
to
go
to
a
home
of
her
own
the
house
had
been
least
the
father
supposed
knowing
that
but
a
small
payment
had
been
made
with
a
promise
to
pay
the
balance
soon
after
the
marriage
the
young
man
had
laid
his
plans
nicely
and
meant
to
profess
that
some
investment
of
his
had
failed
making
it
impossible
for
him
to
make
the
final
payments
and
that
he
had
disliked
to
postpone
the
marriage
or
to
tell
of
his
predicament
feeling
sure
that
he
would
have
the
money
by
the
time
the
payment
was
due
naturally
his
wife
s
fortune
would
suffice
to
pay
for
the
house
which
of
course
she
would
not
let
go
then
if
the
house
was
not
exactly
what
he
had
described
to
the
little
certainly
it
was
large
enough
and
showy
enough
to
make
up
for
the
lack
of
some
of
the
things
which
had
seemed
important
to
her
and
he
had
taken
care
that
it
should
be
so
far
from
the
home
of
her
father
that
the
latter
could
keep
no
eye
on
his
s
business
affairs
if
all
went
well
he
intended
to
have
his
wife
s
fortune
in
his
own
hands
before
their
first
year
of
married
life
should
have
passed
after
that
it
would
not
matter
to
him
whether
the
girl
was
pleased
with
her
home
or
not
she
could
no
longer
help
herself
but
of
all
this
the
father
suspected
nothing
dawn
took
no
interest
in
her
clothes
the
was
chagrined
that
after
all
her
efforts
dawn
was
not
pleased
i
should
think
you
might
show
a
little
gratitude
after
all
the
trouble
i
ve
taken
van
rensselaer
snapped
angrily
dawn
turned
wide
eyes
of
astonishment
upon
her
for
what
she
asked
i
didn
t
want
the
things
i
supposed
you
did
it
to
please
father
didn
t
want
them
exclaimed
her
and
how
would
you
expect
to
get
married
without
them
i
don
t
want
to
be
married
said
dawn
desperately
and
then
closed
her
lips
tightly
with
a
frightened
look
toward
the
door
she
had
not
meant
to
let
any
one
know
that
the
words
had
come
of
themselves
out
of
her
weary
heart
well
upon
my
word
you
re
the
queerest
girl
any
other
girl
in
the
world
would
be
in
high
feather
over
your
chances
but
you
always
were
the
stubbornest
most
contrary
creature
that
ever
drew
breath
whatever
did
you
say
you
d
get
married
for
if
you
didn
t
want
to
i
don
t
think
i
ever
did
said
the
girl
sadly
it
just
came
in
spite
of
me
that
s
all
foolishness
don
t
talk
such
things
to
me
no
girl
has
to
be
married
unless
she
chooses
and
i
ll
warrant
you
had
your
hand
in
it
from
the
start
besides
it
s
too
late
to
talk
of
such
things
now
it
wouldn
t
be
honorable
to
draw
back
now
after
he
s
got
the
house
bought
and
all
i
know
it
said
dawn
miserably
and
stood
looking
out
the
window
blindly
swallowing
hard
to
keep
back
the
tears
she
felt
that
she
must
have
reached
the
limit
of
her
endurance
when
she
would
let
her
see
her
state
of
mind
van
rensselaer
eyed
her
keenly
suspiciously
at
last
she
ventured
another
question
have
you
got
any
other
beau
in
your
head
jemima
she
said
because
if
you
have
you
d
better
put
him
out
pretty
suddenly
if
your
father
should
find
it
out
he
don
t
know
what
he
would
do
he
would
certainly
punish
you
well
big
girl
as
you
are
is
that
what
s
the
matter
answer
me
have
you
got
another
beau
dawn
looked
up
with
great
angry
flashing
eyes
horror
changing
into
contempt
i
have
never
even
thought
of
such
a
dreadful
thing
she
said
with
a
withering
look
and
swept
haughtily
from
the
room
but
on
the
way
upstairs
the
color
crept
slowly
into
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
drooped
was
there
yes
there
was
some
one
else
enshrined
within
her
heart
some
one
whose
face
had
smiled
in
sympathy
just
once
and
toward
whom
she
felt
as
she
had
never
felt
to
any
human
being
save
her
mother
of
course
he
was
nothing
to
her
but
the
vision
of
a
moment
and
never
never
could
he
be
called
by
the
hateful
word
her
stepmother
had
used
that
detestable
word
beau
it
seemed
to
the
poor
tried
child
as
if
she
could
almost
kill
any
one
who
used
that
word
after
that
dawn
endured
her
misery
in
secret
speaking
not
at
all
unless
spoken
to
the
older
woman
looked
at
her
curiously
almost
nervously
sometimes
as
if
the
girl
were
half
uncanny
she
was
glad
in
her
heart
that
the
day
of
the
wedding
was
close
at
hand
for
if
she
knew
anything
about
signs
that
girl
was
on
the
verge
of
throwing
over
a
fine
marriage
and
then
they
would
have
her
on
their
hands
for
years
perhaps
van
rensselaer
had
suffered
not
a
little
for
her
share
in
the
tragedy
of
these
lives
with
which
she
had
bound
up
her
own
and
was
not
willing
to
endure
more
she
shut
her
thin
lips
and
determined
to
watch
the
girl
carefully
and
prevent
if
possible
any
slip
between
cup
and
lip
meantime
with
dread
dawn
counted
the
hours
and
watched
sleepless
through
the
long
nights
now
calling
on
her
dead
mother
for
help
now
praying
to
be
saved
in
some
way
from
the
nameless
fear
which
try
as
she
would
she
could
not
shake
off
the
family
relatives
on
both
sides
were
gathering
and
starting
some
on
long
journeys
to
attend
the
wedding
chapter
vi
charles
winthrop
had
written
his
family
that
matters
which
he
wished
to
complete
would
detain
him
at
the
college
for
a
few
weeks
and
begged
his
father
to
make
his
excuses
at
the
wedding
he
had
an
instinctive
feeling
that
harrington
would
not
care
as
well
as
an
inexplicable
aversion
to
being
a
witness
at
the
wedding
ceremony
of
his
elder
brother
and
the
girl
who
had
burst
upon
his
vision
that
afternoon
and
seemed
to
open
a
new
world
to
him
he
had
long
ago
put
by
the
strange
sweet
sense
of
having
discovered
in
her
a
familiar
who
fitted
into
his
longings
and
his
ideals
as
though
he
had
always
been
waiting
for
her
he
called
the
thought
a
foolish
sentimentality
and
in
view
of
the
relation
in
which
she
was
soon
to
be
placed
to
him
he
tried
to
be
as
as
possible
with
regard
to
her
he
sent
several
pleasant
brotherly
never
reached
the
medium
of
harrington
he
tried
to
accept
the
thought
of
a
new
sister
as
a
delightful
thing
and
always
he
regarded
her
beauty
and
grace
with
the
utmost
reverence
the
father
while
feeling
that
charles
s
absence
was
almost
a
discourtesy
to
his
brother
nevertheless
gave
reluctant
consent
then
a
few
days
before
the
wedding
there
came
over
charles
an
overwhelming
feeling
that
he
must
go
all
his
former
arguments
in
favor
of
remaining
away
seemed
as
water
he
felt
as
if
the
eyes
and
the
smile
of
the
girl
he
had
seen
upon
the
hillside
called
him
imperatively
try
as
he
would
to
tell
himself
that
with
his
present
feelings
it
was
foolish
even
dangerous
for
him
to
go
near
her
and
that
his
brother
was
already
a
little
jealous
owing
to
the
look
that
had
passed
between
them
it
made
no
difference
he
felt
that
he
must
go
and
go
he
did
without
waiting
to
do
more
than
throw
a
few
necessities
into
a
valise
he
took
the
first
that
started
from
boston
all
through
the
long
journey
his
heart
beat
wildly
with
the
thought
that
he
was
to
meet
her
he
was
ashamed
of
the
feeling
yet
in
vain
he
told
himself
that
it
was
wrong
that
he
ought
to
go
back
once
he
flung
himself
out
of
the
coach
at
a
station
where
they
were
taking
on
fresh
horses
determined
to
return
to
boston
and
then
madly
climbed
up
to
the
seat
with
the
driver
just
as
the
coach
started
again
after
that
he
grimly
faced
the
matter
asking
himself
if
it
were
not
better
to
go
on
after
all
meet
his
new
on
a
common
basis
and
get
this
nonsense
out
of
his
head
forever
then
he
tried
to
sleep
and
forget
but
her
face
and
her
smile
haunted
him
and
there
seemed
to
be
an
appeal
in
her
eyes
that
called
him
to
her
aid
when
he
presented
himself
at
his
father
s
door
in
the
early
morning
of
the
day
before
the
wedding
his
face
was
gray
with
combat
yet
in
his
eyes
was
the
light
of
a
noble
resolve
in
spite
of
all
his
reasoning
he
could
not
help
the
feeling
that
he
had
come
because
he
was
needed
but
he
was
here
and
there
was
a
duty
connected
with
it
which
he
felt
strong
to
do
it
was
therefore
not
a
surprise
to
him
when
his
father
met
him
with
eager
welcome
and
a
grave
face
my
son
you
have
come
just
when
i
needed
you
most
he
said
as
he
drew
the
young
man
inside
the
library
door
and
then
charles
noticed
that
his
father
seemed
suddenly
aged
and
heavy
with
sorrow
he
knew
it
was
nothing
connected
with
the
immediate
family
of
the
household
for
they
had
all
welcomed
him
with
eager
clamor
and
delight
sit
down
charles
his
father
was
fastening
the
door
against
intrusion
and
the
young
man
s
heart
stood
still
with
apprehension
winthrop
turned
and
looked
in
his
son
s
face
with
feverishly
bright
eyes
that
showed
their
lack
of
sleep
then
he
seated
himself
in
the
before
the
desk
drawing
charles
s
chair
close
that
he
might
speak
in
lowered
tones
something
terrible
has
occurred
charles
your
mother
does
not
know
yet
the
blow
has
fallen
so
suddenly
that
i
find
myself
unable
to
believe
it
is
true
i
am
dazed
i
can
scarcely
think
charles
your
only
brother
my
the
old
man
paused
and
with
a
sudden
contraction
of
his
heart
charles
noticed
that
there
were
tears
coursing
down
his
father
s
wrinkled
cheeks
the
voice
quavered
and
went
on
our
has
been
guilty
of
a
great
wrong
it
is
best
to
face
the
truth
my
boy
harrington
has
committed
a
crime
i
don
t
see
how
it
can
be
thought
otherwise
by
any
honest
person
i
am
trying
to
look
at
the
facts
but
even
as
i
speak
the
words
i
can
not
realize
that
they
are
true
of
one
of
our
family
charles
waited
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
old
man
s
face
and
a
great
indignation
growing
within
him
toward
the
brother
who
could
dare
bring
dishonor
upon
such
a
father
winthrop
bowed
his
head
upon
his
hand
for
a
moment
as
though
he
could
not
bear
to
reveal
the
whole
truth
then
he
roused
himself
as
one
who
has
need
of
haste
charles
your
brother
already
has
a
wife
and
two
little
children
yet
he
was
proposing
to
wed
another
woman
he
has
dared
to
court
and
win
an
innocent
young
girl
and
to
hoodwink
her
honorable
father
and
the
worst
of
it
is
that
he
meant
to
carry
it
out
and
marry
her
oh
the
shame
of
it
we
are
disgraced
charles
we
are
all
disgraced
with
a
low
groan
the
father
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
bowed
himself
upon
the
desk
the
heart
of
the
young
man
grew
hot
a
great
desire
for
vengeance
was
surging
over
him
he
arose
excitedly
from
his
chair
harrington
has
done
this
father
the
words
burst
from
his
lips
more
like
a
judgment
pronounced
than
like
a
question
or
a
statement
of
fact
it
was
as
if
the
acknowledgment
of
his
brother
s
sin
were
a
kind
of
climax
in
his
thought
of
that
brother
whom
he
had
been
all
these
years
attempting
to
idealize
as
a
boy
so
often
idealizes
an
elder
brother
the
words
bore
with
them
too
the
recognition
of
all
the
pain
and
disappointment
and
perplexity
of
many
things
throughout
the
years
charles
s
finer
nature
suddenly
revolted
in
disgust
from
all
that
he
saw
his
brother
to
be
he
stood
splendidly
indignant
above
the
bowed
head
of
his
father
a
picture
of
fine
strong
manhood
ready
to
avenge
the
rights
of
insulted
womanhood
there
before
him
arose
a
vision
obscuring
the
walls
of
the
vision
of
a
girl
fresh
fair
lovely
with
eyes
alight
cheeks
aglow
floating
hair
and
fluttering
white
drapery
garlanded
in
pink
and
white
blossoms
that
filled
the
air
with
the
breath
of
a
spring
morning
it
blazed
upon
him
with
clearness
and
beauty
and
veiled
by
no
hindering
sense
of
wrong
with
a
great
heart
throb
of
joy
he
recognized
that
she
no
longer
belonged
to
his
brother
the
thought
had
scarcely
thrilled
his
senses
before
he
was
ashamed
of
it
how
could
he
think
of
joy
or
anything
else
in
the
midst
of
the
shame
and
trouble
that
had
fallen
upon
them
all
and
most
of
all
upon
the
beautiful
girl
who
would
bear
the
heaviest
burden
true
there
was
another
side
to
the
matter
a
side
in
which
she
might
be
thankful
that
harrington
s
true
character
had
been
discovered
before
things
had
gone
further
but
there
was
mortification
and
disgrace
inevitable
then
it
was
to
be
presumed
that
she
had
loved
harrington
or
why
should
she
be
about
to
marry
him
poor
child
his
heart
stood
still
in
pity
as
he
realized
what
the
sin
of
his
brother
would
mean
to
her
these
thoughts
went
swiftly
through
his
mind
as
he
stood
beside
his
father
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
the
instant
of
the
elder
man
s
silence
he
reviewed
the
whole
catastrophe
in
its
various
phases
and
lived
through
years
of
experience
and
knowledge
then
his
father
s
trembling
voice
took
up
the
story
again
yes
harrington
did
that
they
were
charles
s
own
words
but
somehow
on
his
father
s
tongue
they
spoke
a
new
pathos
and
again
the
young
man
saw
another
side
to
the
whole
terrible
matter
harrington
was
the
oldest
son
adored
of
his
mother
though
he
had
been
gone
from
home
for
years
he
had
yet
remained
her
idol
until
it
had
seemed
his
every
virtue
had
grown
to
perfection
while
all
his
faults
were
utterly
forgotten
during
his
visits
which
had
been
few
and
far
between
the
whole
family
had
put
itself
out
of
its
routine
and
hung
upon
his
wishes
his
stories
had
been
listened
to
with
the
deference
due
to
one
older
and
wiser
than
any
of
them
could
ever
hope
to
be
his
wishes
had
been
law
his
opinions
gospel
truth
charles
recalled
how
his
mother
had
always
called
together
the
entire
family
to
listen
to
the
reading
to
one
of
harrington
s
rare
epistles
demanding
a
solemnity
and
attention
second
only
to
that
required
at
family
worship
these
letters
always
ended
with
a
description
of
some
new
enterprise
in
which
he
was
deeply
involved
and
which
required
large
sums
of
money
his
father
and
mother
had
always
managed
to
send
him
something
to
help
out
at
such
times
and
made
no
secret
of
it
rather
rejoicing
that
they
were
able
to
do
so
charles
knew
that
his
father
owned
large
and
valuable
tracts
of
land
and
was
well
off
yet
it
had
not
always
been
convenient
to
send
harrington
large
sums
of
money
and
often
the
family
luxuries
and
pleasures
had
been
somewhat
curtailed
in
consequence
all
such
sacrifices
had
been
cheerfully
made
for
the
family
idol
by
himself
as
well
as
by
his
three
sisters
his
maiden
aunt
and
his
father
and
mother
at
this
critical
moment
it
occurred
to
charles
to
wonder
if
his
father
had
ever
received
any
interest
from
these
many
sums
of
money
which
he
from
time
to
time
had
put
into
harrington
s
business
schemes
then
his
father
s
voice
drowned
all
other
thoughts
i
do
not
know
how
to
tell
your
poor
mother
the
trembling
tones
were
almost
unrecognizable
to
the
son
she
ought
to
know
at
once
we
must
plan
what
to
do
the
van
rensselaers
must
be
told
he
bowed
his
head
with
another
groan
the
son
sat
down
and
endeavored
to
get
a
better
grasp
of
the
situation
since
when
have
you
known
this
father
he
asked
keenly
last
night
mother
had
gone
to
bed
and
i
did
not
disturb
her
i
felt
i
must
think
it
all
to
i
told
them
but
i
can
not
see
my
way
any
clearer
it
is
a
most
infamous
thing
to
have
happened
in
a
respectable
family
charles
i
m
sorry
to
have
to
say
it
but
i
m
afraid
your
brother
is
the
old
gentleman
s
face
was
red
and
excited
as
he
brought
forth
the
awful
utterance
it
was
the
thought
which
had
been
growing
in
his
mind
all
through
the
long
night
watch
but
he
had
not
been
willing
to
acknowledge
it
he
arose
now
and
began
to
pace
the
room
he
certainly
is
if
this
is
true
father
said
the
son
frowning
but
are
you
quite
sure
it
is
not
some
miserable
blackmailing
scheme
such
stories
are
often
trumped
up
at
the
last
minute
to
get
money
out
of
respectable
people
i
ve
heard
of
it
in
boston
it
is
rare
of
course
but
it
could
happen
i
can
not
think
harrington
would
do
such
an
awful
thing
son
it
is
all
too
true
said
the
old
man
sadly
do
you
remember
william
mccord
you
know
he
was
my
trusted
for
years
and
i
have
kept
in
touch
with
him
by
letter
ever
since
he
went
out
west
to
take
up
a
claim
on
gold
land
well
it
was
he
that
brought
me
the
terrible
news
he
came
last
evening
after
mother
and
the
girls
had
gone
upstairs
he
did
not
want
to
see
them
and
have
them
question
him
till
he
had
told
me
all
he
brought
letters
and
proofs
from
harrington
s
wife
and
the
minister
who
married
them
and
moreover
he
was
an
to
the
fact
that
harrington
lived
in
the
west
with
his
wife
and
two
children
you
yourself
know
that
william
mccord
could
not
tell
a
lie
no
assented
charles
never
harrington
s
wife
is
a
good
respectable
woman
though
not
very
well
educated
she
is
the
daughter
of
a
virginia
man
who
went
out
there
to
hunt
for
gold
he
died
a
couple
of
years
ago
and
now
the
daughter
and
her
children
have
no
one
to
look
after
them
it
seems
harrington
has
neglected
them
for
the
past
three
years
only
coming
home
once
in
six
months
and
giving
them
very
little
money
he
has
told
them
a
story
of
hard
luck
the
wife
is
desperate
now
she
has
been
ill
and
needs
many
things
for
herself
and
the
children
at
last
she
learned
of
harrington
s
intended
marriage
through
william
whose
sister
had
written
him
the
home
news
she
sold
what
few
possessions
she
had
and
brought
the
proceeds
to
william
begging
him
to
come
on
here
and
find
out
if
the
story
was
true
william
refused
to
take
her
money
but
started
at
once
at
his
own
expense
and
came
straight
to
me
with
the
story
just
think
of
it
charles
our
grandchildren
actually
cold
and
hungry
and
almost
own
flesh
and
blood
your
nephew
and
niece
charles
the
younger
man
frowned
he
had
very
little
sympathy
at
present
to
expend
upon
any
possible
nephews
and
nieces
he
was
thinking
of
a
lovely
girl
with
eyes
like
stars
what
were
cold
and
hunger
compared
to
her
plight
where
is
my
brother
the
boy
looked
older
than
he
had
ever
seemed
to
his
father
as
he
asked
the
question
i
do
not
know
he
has
always
told
us
to
write
to
an
address
in
new
york
but
often
he
has
not
answered
our
letters
for
weeks
i
am
afraid
there
is
still
more
to
be
told
than
we
know
mccord
tells
me
he
was
under
some
sort
of
a
cloud
financially
out
trouble
about
shares
in
a
gold
mine
i
m
afraid
he
has
been
speculating
he
has
borrowed
a
great
deal
of
money
from
me
at
one
time
and
another
but
he
has
always
told
me
that
he
was
doing
nicely
and
that
some
day
i
should
have
a
handsome
return
for
all
i
had
put
in
but
if
that
is
the
case
why
should
he
have
dared
to
involve
a
sweet
and
innocent
young
girl
in
it
all
why
should
he
dare
do
so
dreadful
a
thing
he
is
under
the
impression
that
his
first
wife
is
dead
i
can
not
think
that
my
boy
would
do
this
thing
the
father
s
head
dropped
upon
his
breast
but
the
brother
stood
erect
with
flashing
eyes
i
see
it
all
clearly
father
he
is
marrying
this
girl
for
her
money
he
needs
money
for
some
of
his
schemes
and
he
is
afraid
to
ask
you
for
any
more
lest
you
suspect
something
he
told
me
once
that
she
was
very
rich
i
think
you
are
right
my
brother
is
a
scoundrel
the
father
groaned
aloud
but
father
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
have
you
sent
word
to
van
rensselaer
the
wedding
is
set
for
morning
there
will
be
scarcely
time
to
stop
the
guests
from
coming
outside
the
window
wheels
could
be
heard
on
the
gravel
as
the
old
coachman
drove
the
family
carriage
up
to
the
front
steps
pompey
the
stable
boy
followed
driving
the
mare
in
the
carryall
almost
simultaneously
came
the
hurry
of
ladies
feet
down
the
staircase
and
the
swish
of
silken
skirts
betty
and
cordelia
and
madeleine
rushed
through
the
hall
and
climbed
into
the
carryall
with
soft
excitement
and
gentle
laughter
this
wedding
journey
was
a
great
event
and
they
had
talked
of
nothing
else
for
weeks
come
charles
come
father
aren
t
you
ready
called
betty
it
is
high
time
we
started
mother
is
all
dressed
and
aunt
martha
is
just
tying
her
bonnet
charles
mother
wants
you
to
ride
in
the
carriage
with
her
this
morning
but
you
are
to
change
off
with
us
so
we
ll
all
have
a
good
look
at
you
the
father
caught
his
breath
and
looked
helplessly
at
his
son
i
did
not
realize
it
was
getting
so
late
he
murmured
of
course
the
journey
must
be
stopped
of
course
father
agreed
charles
decidedly
go
quickly
and
tell
mother
all
about
it
i
will
tell
the
girls
and
aunt
martha
he
added
with
a
look
as
though
he
were
going
to
his
death
the
older
man
hurried
up
the
stairs
to
his
wife
and
charles
went
out
to
the
piazza
the
two
servants
stood
grinning
happily
feeling
the
overflow
of
the
festive
occasion
charles
could
not
reveal
his
secret
there
come
into
the
house
a
minute
girls
i
ve
something
to
tell
you
indeed
no
charles
said
cordelia
emphatically
i
will
not
climb
out
over
the
wheels
again
i
nearly
ruined
my
pelisse
getting
in
it
is
very
dusty
and
i
have
covered
myself
all
nicely
for
the
journey
won
t
it
keep
cordelia
you
must
come
said
the
young
man
imperiously
and
stalked
into
the
house
uncertain
whether
they
would
follow
him
in
a
moment
betty
appeared
roguishly
in
the
parlor
door
whither
charles
had
gone
they
won
t
come
charles
she
said
it
s
no
use
if
you
had
news
of
an
earthquake
or
a
new
railroad
they
wouldn
t
stir
nothing
weighs
against
one
s
wedding
garments
and
cordelia
has
taken
special
pains
but
charles
did
not
respond
to
betty
s
nonsense
in
his
usual
merry
way
betty
listen
he
said
gravely
an
awful
thing
has
happened
is
harrington
dead
asked
betty
with
wide
frightened
eyes
and
blanched
face
no
but
he
might
better
be
betty
he
has
a
wife
and
two
little
children
out
west
and
he
has
deserted
them
to
marry
again
betty
did
not
scream
nor
exclaim
how
dreadful
instead
she
sat
down
quickly
in
the
first
chair
at
hand
after
an
instant
s
silence
she
said
in
her
way
then
there
won
t
be
any
wedding
of
course
and
what
will
that
poor
girl
do
has
anybody
thought
about
her
somehow
i
m
not
surprised
i
ve
always
secretly
thought
harrington
was
selfish
it
s
like
him
never
to
think
how
he
would
make
other
people
suffer
his
letters
always
put
father
and
mother
in
hot
water
have
they
told
her
yet
charles
oh
i
wish
i
could
go
and
help
comfort
her
i
can
t
think
of
anything
more
mortifying
for
her
betty
it
is
good
that
she
will
be
saved
from
anything
worse
it
is
good
to
have
it
found
out
beforehand
oh
yes
of
course
but
she
won
t
think
of
that
with
all
the
wedding
guests
coming
how
can
she
have
time
to
be
thankful
that
she
is
saved
from
marrying
a
selfish
bad
man
charles
it
is
a
shame
somebody
ought
to
be
at
hand
to
step
in
and
take
harrington
s
place
if
i
were
a
man
i
d
throw
myself
at
her
feet
and
offer
to
marry
her
say
charles
why
don
t
you
do
it
yourself
declared
betty
romantically
the
heart
of
the
young
man
leaped
up
with
a
great
bound
and
a
flood
of
color
went
over
his
face
and
neck
but
the
parlor
was
darkened
and
moreover
the
girls
in
the
carryall
were
diligently
calling
so
betty
vanished
to
impart
the
news
and
charles
was
alone
for
the
moment
with
a
new
thought
which
almost
took
his
breath
from
him
then
down
the
oaken
staircase
with
soft
but
decided
rustle
came
madam
winthrop
behind
her
nervous
protesting
came
her
husband
s
anxious
footsteps
but
mother
really
it
won
t
do
we
couldn
t
go
you
know
under
the
circumstances
don
t
say
another
word
winthrop
charles
heard
his
mother
s
most
majestic
voice
i
intend
to
go
and
there
is
no
need
of
further
talk
depend
upon
it
harrington
will
be
able
fully
to
explain
all
this
impossible
story
when
he
arrives
and
it
is
not
for
his
family
to
lose
faith
in
him
but
mother
you
don
t
understand
protested
her
husband
still
hastening
after
her
and
putting
out
a
detaining
hand
indeed
i
do
understand
said
the
woman
s
voice
coldly
i
understand
that
my
boy
is
being
persecuted
it
is
you
apparently
who
do
not
understand
i
am
his
mother
and
i
intend
to
stand
by
him
and
not
let
a
breath
of
this
wretched
scandal
touch
him
the
wedding
will
go
on
as
planned
of
course
and
what
would
the
world
think
if
his
family
were
not
present
how
could
you
possibly
explain
your
absence
except
by
bringing
out
these
most
unfatherly
suspicions
no
winthrop
there
is
all
the
more
need
of
haste
that
we
may
forestall
any
of
these
wicked
rumors
let
us
start
at
once
but
no
you
needn
t
but
janet
me
i
don
t
wish
to
hear
another
word
i
m
going
no
matter
what
you
say
and
so
are
martha
and
the
girls
you
can
stay
at
home
if
you
like
i
suppose
you
are
a
man
and
of
course
will
do
as
you
please
i
will
explain
your
absence
the
best
way
i
can
but
i
m
going
come
martha
we
will
get
into
the
back
seat
charles
stepped
out
of
the
darkened
parlor
and
intercepted
his
mother
mother
really
you
re
making
a
mistake
you
have
not
stopped
to
think
what
you
are
going
into
it
won
t
do
for
you
and
the
girls
to
go
i
will
go
with
but
the
imperious
lady
shook
her
son
s
hand
from
her
arm
as
though
it
had
been
a
viper
charles
you
forget
yourself
she
said
it
is
not
for
you
to
tell
your
mother
she
is
making
a
mistake
you
must
not
think
that
because
you
have
been
to
college
you
can
therefore
teach
your
mother
how
to
conduct
her
affairs
stand
out
of
my
way
and
then
follow
me
to
the
carriage
you
are
displeasing
me
greatly
it
would
have
been
better
for
you
to
remain
in
boston
than
to
come
here
to
talk
to
your
mother
in
this
way
the
majestic
lady
marched
on
her
way
to
the
carriage
followed
by
her
frightened
who
scuttled
after
her
tearfully
not
knowing
which
to
dread
the
most
her
s
tyranny
the
wrath
of
her
brother
or
the
scorn
of
her
nephew
the
habit
of
her
life
had
been
always
to
follow
the
stronger
nature
in
this
case
it
was
madam
winthrop
father
and
son
stood
looking
on
helplessly
then
the
father
called
well
janet
if
you
must
go
leave
the
girls
at
home
with
martha
the
aunt
drew
back
timidly
from
the
she
was
approaching
get
in
at
once
martha
commanded
madam
winthrop
already
established
in
the
back
seat
of
the
coach
we
have
no
time
to
waste
girls
you
may
drive
on
ahead
until
we
reach
the
elizabeth
your
conduct
is
unseemly
for
such
a
joyous
occasion
what
will
the
neighbors
think
to
see
your
flushed
excited
face
wipe
your
eyes
and
pull
down
your
veil
drive
on
cordelia
and
see
that
elizabeth
s
conduct
is
more
decorous
she
waved
the
carryall
on
and
cordelia
and
madeleine
awed
and
obeyed
while
excitable
betty
strove
to
put
by
the
signs
of
her
perturbation
until
she
was
out
of
her
mother
s
sight
in
brief
whispers
she
had
succeeded
in
conveying
to
her
sisters
a
slight
knowledge
of
what
had
occurred
the
old
coachman
and
the
stable
boy
stood
wondering
by
and
marvelled
that
the
wedding
had
gone
to
madam
s
head
they
had
seen
her
in
these
imperious
moods
but
had
not
thought
this
an
occasion
for
one
some
one
must
have
displeased
her
very
much
for
her
to
get
in
a
towering
rage
on
the
day
before
her
eldest
son
s
wedding
now
winthrop
we
are
ready
if
you
and
charles
will
take
your
seats
father
and
son
looked
at
each
other
in
dismay
i
guess
there
s
nothing
for
it
but
to
get
in
father
perhaps
you
can
bring
her
to
her
senses
on
the
way
and
i
can
drive
back
with
her
or
they
can
stop
at
an
inn
while
we
go
on
it
really
won
t
do
to
delay
for
we
have
a
duty
to
the
van
rensselaers
you
are
right
charles
we
must
go
perhaps
as
you
say
we
can
persuade
mother
on
the
way
i
am
dubious
however
she
is
very
set
in
her
way
winthrop
you
will
need
only
to
get
your
hat
called
his
wife
from
the
coach
i
have
had
your
portmanteau
and
charles
s
fastened
on
behind
your
things
are
all
here
your
hat
is
lying
on
the
hall
table
with
a
sigh
of
submission
the
strong
man
obediently
got
his
hat
and
took
his
place
on
the
front
seat
of
the
coach
while
charles
indignantly
swung
himself
up
beside
his
father
then
the
family
started
for
the
wedding
that
was
not
to
be
chapter
vii
the
long
journey
was
anything
but
what
it
had
promised
to
be
when
it
was
anticipated
the
carryall
containing
the
three
girls
headed
the
procession
they
were
talking
in
subdued
and
frightened
tones
madeleine
and
cordelia
endeavoring
to
find
out
from
betty
more
than
the
child
really
knew
when
she
could
not
satisfy
their
curiosity
and
anxiety
with
facts
she
supplied
them
with
running
comments
on
human
nature
and
her
elder
brother
in
particular
now
and
again
they
pulled
her
up
sharply
with
betty
be
still
or
i
am
ashamed
of
you
elizabeth
you
jump
to
conclusions
i
am
sure
there
must
be
some
explanation
charles
was
very
wrong
to
tell
you
until
he
had
made
sure
about
it
you
see
mother
does
not
believe
the
story
or
she
would
never
go
mother
wouldn
t
believe
harrington
had
done
wrong
if
she
saw
him
do
it
declared
betty
irreverently
now
betty
how
you
talk
one
would
think
you
didn
t
love
harrington
well
i
don
t
very
much
and
that
s
a
fact
shrugged
betty
charles
is
worth
two
of
him
harrington
always
hushes
me
up
when
he
comes
home
and
talks
as
if
i
were
a
baby
yet
besides
he
is
selfish
look
how
he
wouldn
t
take
me
to
harriet
howegate
s
when
he
was
home
the
last
time
just
because
he
was
too
lazy
to
change
his
clothes
i
don
t
see
why
i
should
love
him
if
i
don
t
just
because
he
happens
to
belong
to
the
same
family
i
m
sure
he
can
t
love
us
much
or
he
wouldn
t
have
gone
off
so
long
ago
and
stayed
away
from
us
so
much
why
betty
said
madeleine
shocked
he
had
to
go
and
earn
his
living
and
make
a
man
s
way
in
the
world
no
he
didn
t
he
could
have
stayed
at
home
and
gone
into
business
with
father
as
father
wanted
him
to
i
haven
t
a
bit
of
patience
with
harrington
i
m
sure
betty
that
s
a
very
shocking
way
to
talk
about
your
own
brother
and
mother
would
highly
disapprove
said
madeleine
if
i
were
you
i
should
keep
still
betty
advised
cordelia
betty
pouted
and
a
solemn
silence
settled
upon
the
three
as
the
old
gray
horse
plodded
sleepily
over
the
road
the
occupants
of
the
coach
were
by
no
means
at
ease
aunt
martha
sat
shrivelled
in
the
back
seat
with
the
ready
tears
coursing
silently
down
her
cheeks
she
had
heard
enough
of
what
her
brother
had
told
his
wife
to
be
filled
with
gloomy
apprehensions
aunt
martha
was
always
sure
of
the
worst
madam
winthrop
sat
severely
silent
with
her
delicate
cameo
features
held
high
her
keen
blue
eyes
never
wavered
nor
did
her
firm
thin
lips
quiver
apparently
she
had
not
one
misgiving
and
her
only
regret
seemed
to
be
that
the
rest
of
the
family
had
taken
leave
of
their
senses
she
looked
straight
in
front
of
her
ignoring
the
sad
gray
head
of
her
husband
and
the
yellow
curls
of
the
strong
young
son
with
whom
she
was
offended
they
would
all
see
their
mistake
soon
enough
and
meantime
she
was
giving
them
a
bit
of
a
lesson
not
to
doubt
the
idol
of
her
heart
to
do
her
justice
she
firmly
believed
she
was
right
and
was
amazed
that
her
husband
had
taken
the
attitude
he
had
of
course
harrington
would
not
do
such
a
dreadful
thing
such
things
did
not
happen
in
real
life
it
was
out
of
the
question
she
dismissed
the
subject
with
that
and
fell
to
going
over
her
own
arrangements
and
the
wardrobe
of
the
family
with
satisfaction
the
sound
of
the
horses
hoofs
on
the
old
corduroy
road
and
the
husky
crickets
by
the
wayside
beat
a
funeral
dirge
for
the
heart
of
the
father
in
the
front
seat
his
countenance
was
heavy
and
now
and
again
he
brought
forth
an
audible
sigh
the
lugubrious
attitude
of
her
family
annoyed
madam
winthrop
she
turned
to
her
sharply
for
pity
s
sake
martha
do
stop
snivelling
one
would
think
you
were
going
to
a
funeral
instead
of
to
a
wedding
i
must
say
i
don
t
think
you
honor
your
nephew
very
much
showing
such
distrust
in
him
do
wipe
your
eyes
and
sit
up
if
you
go
on
this
way
you
won
t
be
able
to
come
to
the
ceremony
morning
and
you
know
how
that
will
annoy
harrington
i
must
say
winthrop
you
are
acting
in
a
very
strange
manner
for
the
father
of
such
a
son
she
always
called
him
winthrop
when
he
had
offended
her
at
other
times
it
was
father
her
husband
turned
in
the
seat
and
faced
her
solemnly
janet
he
said
sadly
it
s
no
use
for
you
to
try
to
blind
yourself
to
the
truth
you
ll
only
have
it
harder
to
bear
in
the
end
you
might
as
well
understand
the
awful
truth
that
our
boy
harrington
has
committed
a
great
sin
and
we
ought
to
be
thankful
that
it
was
discovered
before
any
more
harm
was
done
you
don
t
seem
to
see
what
a
task
we
ve
got
before
us
to
tell
that
father
and
his
innocent
young
daughter
that
the
man
in
whom
they
trusted
our
son
has
played
them
false
now
winthrop
i
don
t
want
to
hear
another
word
of
such
talk
you
must
be
beside
yourself
madam
winthrop
half
arose
in
her
seat
and
cried
out
shrilly
stop
it
i
say
don
t
you
dare
say
such
words
in
my
presence
again
if
you
do
i
shall
get
right
out
of
this
carriage
and
walk
i
tell
you
and
what
will
the
servants
think
of
you
then
you
will
find
out
your
mistake
in
due
time
of
course
and
be
ashamed
of
yourself
until
then
i
must
ask
you
not
to
speak
to
me
on
the
subject
no
charles
don
t
you
dare
to
interfere
between
me
and
your
father
again
i
have
had
enough
of
your
disrespect
for
one
day
just
keep
absolutely
quiet
until
you
can
speak
in
a
proper
way
i
simply
will
not
stand
such
talk
she
sat
up
with
dignity
and
spoke
to
them
both
as
if
they
were
naughty
children
her
husband
looked
into
her
eyes
sadly
for
a
moment
and
then
turned
deliberately
back
to
his
horses
he
knew
by
former
experience
that
it
was
well
nigh
impossible
to
convince
his
wife
of
anything
against
her
will
well
she
would
have
to
go
on
and
take
the
consequences
of
her
stubbornness
there
was
no
other
way
and
perhaps
it
was
as
well
for
with
her
excitable
nature
there
was
no
telling
what
state
it
might
throw
her
into
once
she
realized
the
truth
about
her
idolized
son
she
might
lose
consciousness
and
have
to
be
carried
back
and
so
perhaps
delay
them
his
first
duty
now
was
to
tell
the
sad
truth
to
his
old
friend
van
rensselaer
and
his
poor
daughter
every
step
that
the
horses
took
made
him
shrink
more
and
more
from
the
task
before
him
it
seemed
that
his
shame
and
disgrace
were
being
burnt
into
his
soul
with
a
red
hot
iron
he
kept
thinking
how
he
should
tell
his
story
to
his
host
when
he
reached
his
journey
s
end
and
the
horses
hoofs
beat
out
the
dirge
of
a
funeral
while
keeping
pace
behind
with
decorous
bearing
rode
the
two
old
servants
pondering
what
had
cast
a
shadow
over
the
gay
party
they
had
hoped
to
escort
as
the
young
man
in
the
front
seat
of
the
coach
sat
and
frowned
at
the
shining
chestnut
backs
of
the
horses
he
was
conning
over
and
over
a
thought
that
his
sister
had
put
into
his
heart
and
each
time
it
ran
like
sweet
fire
along
his
veins
until
it
began
to
seem
a
possibility
and
fairly
took
his
breath
away
the
day
was
wonderful
the
air
was
fine
and
rare
the
sky
clear
with
not
a
fleck
of
cloud
to
mar
the
blue
that
fairly
called
attention
to
itself
as
being
bluer
than
ever
before
but
not
one
of
all
that
little
company
of
saw
it
the
foliage
everywhere
was
washed
fresh
for
the
occasion
by
a
shower
that
had
passed
in
the
night
diamonds
strung
themselves
from
to
and
begemmed
even
the
mullein
stalks
late
dandelions
flared
and
gleamed
shy
smiled
here
and
there
by
the
roadside
in
delicate
pink
cups
inviting
the
bees
the
birds
in
the
trees
were
singing
everywhere
and
the
sweet
winds
lifted
branches
and
played
a
subdued
accompaniment
to
the
soul
of
the
young
man
their
music
came
in
happy
harmonies
and
while
he
was
not
conscious
of
it
little
by
little
they
began
to
play
him
a
kind
of
wedding
march
the
joyous
melody
of
his
thoughts
now
glad
now
fearful
yet
ever
growing
sweeter
and
more
sure
of
the
victorious
climax
he
grew
presently
unconscious
of
the
inharmony
behind
him
of
aunt
martha
and
her
efforts
not
to
sniff
of
his
mother
s
disapproval
and
of
his
father
s
heavy
heart
he
thought
only
of
the
girl
whom
he
had
seen
upon
the
hillside
and
the
smile
her
eyes
had
given
him
as
they
met
his
every
time
he
thought
upon
it
now
his
quickened
all
the
flood
of
emotion
that
she
had
set
going
that
spring
afternoon
upon
the
hudson
hillside
and
that
he
had
fought
bravely
all
these
weeks
and
thought
he
had
conquered
came
now
upon
him
with
the
power
of
energy
and
swept
over
his
being
in
a
of
gladness
in
vain
he
shamed
himself
for
such
unseemly
joy
when
his
only
brother
was
in
disgrace
in
vain
he
told
himself
that
the
would
be
plunged
into
grief
when
her
bridegroom
turned
out
to
be
no
bridegroom
at
all
still
his
heart
would
catch
the
faint
melody
of
the
those
birds
and
winds
and
branches
were
breathing
and
would
go
singing
along
with
a
new
gladness
the
morning
was
a
silent
one
for
the
whole
party
even
the
coachman
checked
pompey
s
levity
when
a
robin
chased
a
chipmunk
across
a
distant
path
and
the
old
darkey
snapped
him
up
sharply
when
he
ventured
a
question
or
a
wonder
about
marsa
and
missus
but
while
each
held
to
his
own
thoughts
and
the
horses
sped
willingly
over
the
miles
in
the
heart
of
the
young
man
in
the
front
seat
was
growing
a
steady
purpose
about
noon
they
stopped
at
an
inn
to
dine
and
give
the
horses
a
brief
respite
madam
winthrop
would
not
lie
down
as
they
urged
her
nor
would
she
permit
her
husband
or
her
son
to
talk
with
her
concerning
the
forbidden
theme
she
kept
the
three
girls
with
her
also
that
nothing
might
be
said
to
them
to
prejudice
them
against
their
brother
aunt
martha
however
unable
to
bear
up
longer
under
the
scornful
scrutiny
of
her
was
glad
to
take
refuge
on
the
high
bed
that
the
landlady
put
at
her
service
and
weep
a
few
consoling
tears
into
the
homespun
linen
aunt
martha
was
by
no
means
sure
that
all
was
well
with
the
boy
whom
she
adored
though
she
acknowledged
to
herself
that
he
had
his
weaknesses
had
she
not
seen
those
very
weaknesses
from
babyhood
upward
and
helped
many
times
to
hide
them
from
his
blind
mother
and
adoring
sisters
her
fearful
soul
accepted
the
possibility
of
his
sin
yet
loved
him
in
spite
of
it
all
she
resented
the
thought
that
public
opinion
would
be
against
harrington
if
he
had
done
this
thing
and
could
she
have
had
her
way
would
have
had
public
opinion
changed
to
suit
his
special
need
she
felt
in
her
secret
soul
that
prodigies
like
harrington
should
not
be
expected
to
follow
the
laws
like
ordinary
mortals
madam
winthrop
sat
bolt
upright
in
a
wooden
chair
and
eyed
her
three
daughters
suspiciously
now
and
then
she
made
a
remark
about
their
conduct
at
the
wedding
and
they
acquiesced
meekly
they
had
learned
never
to
dispute
with
their
mother
when
she
was
in
her
present
mood
charles
and
his
father
wandered
by
common
consent
into
the
woods
it
was
the
son
who
spoke
first
father
i
ve
been
thinking
all
the
morning
about
what
you
said
of
van
rensselaer
he
spoke
the
name
shyly
reverently
and
his
heart
throbbed
painfully
he
felt
himself
very
young
and
presumptuous
the
bright
color
glowed
in
his
face
it
will
be
terrible
for
her
he
breathed
the
words
as
if
they
hurt
him
yes
assented
the
father
i
can
not
get
her
out
of
my
mind
the
poor
innocent
child
think
of
betty
charles
suppose
it
was
betty
the
young
man
frowned
father
did
you
ever
see
her
no
said
the
older
man
wondering
at
his
son
s
vehemence
did
you
yes
i
saw
her
once
when
i
met
harrington
on
my
way
to
boston
i
stopped
off
with
him
at
the
school
where
she
was
being
educated
and
we
saw
her
she
is
beautiful
father
beautiful
and
very
young
she
looked
as
if
she
could
not
stand
a
thing
like
this
as
if
it
might
crush
her
don
t
you
think
we
ought
to
do
something
for
her
to
make
it
easier
isn
t
it
our
place
i
father
in
the
bible
you
know
when
the
older
brother
died
or
failed
in
any
way
the
younger
brother
had
to
take
up
the
obligation
do
you
understand
what
i
mean
father
do
you
think
i
could
i
mean
do
you
think
she
would
let
me
it
wouldn
t
be
so
public
and
mortifying
you
know
and
i
think
girls
care
a
great
deal
about
that
betty
would
i
m
sure
the
father
looked
up
in
astonishment
what
do
you
mean
charles
do
you
mean
you
would
marry
her
why
yes
father
that
s
what
i
meant
what
do
you
think
of
it
the
boy
in
him
came
to
the
front
for
an
instant
and
looked
out
of
his
eyes
though
he
shrank
from
the
blunt
way
the
older
man
had
of
stating
facts
his
father
eyed
him
keenly
but
you
re
only
a
boy
charles
and
you
re
not
through
college
yet
how
could
you
marry
i
m
past
boasted
the
boy
and
vanished
into
the
man
a
graver
look
came
out
upon
his
face
i
could
leave
college
if
it
were
necessary
or
i
could
go
on
and
finish
i
could
work
part
of
the
time
and
take
care
of
her
the
last
words
he
breathed
gently
reverently
like
a
benediction
the
father
stopped
in
the
wooded
path
and
grasped
his
son
s
hand
boy
you
ve
got
good
stuff
in
you
i
m
proud
of
you
he
said
lifting
his
head
triumphantly
if
only
your
brother
had
been
like
that
then
he
bowed
his
head
in
bitter
thought
but
the
young
man
s
thoughts
were
not
on
harrington
now
he
grasped
his
father
s
hand
and
waited
impatiently
for
further
words
from
him
well
father
the
old
man
lifted
his
head
but
boy
you
do
not
know
her
you
have
seen
her
only
once
you
can
t
spoil
your
own
life
that
way
a
flood
of
color
went
over
the
younger
face
and
into
his
eyes
came
a
depth
of
earnestness
that
showed
his
father
that
the
man
had
awakened
in
his
son
he
was
no
longer
a
boy
father
i
do
not
need
to
know
her
i
love
her
already
i
have
loved
her
ever
since
i
saw
her
that
was
why
i
did
not
want
to
come
to
the
wedding
i
felt
that
i
could
not
bear
it
the
kindly
older
gaze
searched
the
fine
young
face
tenderly
but
the
lover
s
eyes
looked
back
at
him
and
wavered
not
is
it
so
son
words
were
grave
then
god
pity
bless
you
he
added
with
an
upward
look
i
am
afraid
there
is
no
easy
way
ahead
of
you
yet
i
am
proud
to
call
you
my
son
after
this
they
walked
on
silently
through
the
woods
over
a
pathway
of
flecked
gold
where
the
sunlight
sifted
through
the
leafy
branches
no
sound
came
to
interrupt
the
silence
beyond
the
whisking
of
a
squirrel
or
the
flirt
of
a
bird
s
wings
in
the
branches
the
pealed
forth
from
the
inn
and
they
turned
quietly
to
retrace
their
steps
they
were
almost
in
sight
of
the
house
before
either
spoke
then
the
father
said
son
she
does
not
know
you
have
you
any
idea
how
she
will
take
all
this
none
at
all
father
it
was
spoken
humbly
what
is
your
idea
have
you
made
any
plans
not
that
i
shall
tell
her
at
once
if
i
may
and
let
her
decide
if
she
is
willing
the
wedding
may
go
on
as
planned
a
light
came
into
the
older
man
s
face
though
he
looked
troubled
well
said
charles
perhaps
you
may
succeed
but
i
fear
i
fear
nevertheless
your
noble
action
helps
me
to
hold
up
my
head
and
look
her
father
in
the
eye
if
i
have
one
son
who
is
a
scoundrel
at
least
i
have
one
who
is
not
and
who
is
willing
to
face
his
brother
s
obligations
they
went
in
then
and
sat
down
to
a
dinner
of
which
both
were
able
to
partake
more
enjoyably
than
either
had
supposed
possible
charles
isn
t
there
going
to
be
an
awful
time
when
we
get
there
whispered
betty
as
they
passed
out
to
the
carriages
i
hope
not
betty
said
charles
with
a
solemn
light
in
his
eyes
that
made
the
girl
wonder
charles
took
his
seat
beside
his
father
with
hopefulness
and
all
that
long
afternoon
the
music
of
nature
rang
on
but
now
to
both
men
the
dirge
was
almost
lost
in
the
swelling
and
sounding
of
the
wedding
march
chapter
viii
all
the
afternoon
madam
winthrop
had
steadily
refused
to
converse
about
her
oldest
son
the
party
were
nearing
the
edge
of
the
town
where
the
van
rensselaers
lived
twice
charles
had
endeavored
to
bring
his
mother
s
mind
to
the
subject
and
once
his
father
had
said
now
mother
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
you
put
aside
your
attitude
and
let
me
tell
you
all
about
this
matter
but
to
all
advances
she
was
adamant
i
shall
never
allow
you
to
say
such
wicked
things
about
my
son
declared
the
old
lady
rising
from
her
seat
and
attempting
to
get
out
of
the
coach
they
were
compelled
to
give
it
up
and
trust
to
developments
the
stars
were
coming
out
when
they
entered
the
village
streets
the
father
called
to
his
daughters
to
wait
a
moment
and
he
stopped
the
coach
horses
turning
around
in
his
seat
he
faced
his
wife
janet
said
he
and
his
voice
was
firm
as
when
he
was
a
young
man
it
is
best
that
the
family
stop
at
the
inn
while
charles
and
i
go
on
to
the
house
and
make
the
family
acquainted
with
the
truth
i
wish
you
and
martha
and
the
girls
to
stop
here
and
wait
until
our
return
the
old
lady
looked
ahead
impatiently
as
if
she
did
not
see
her
husband
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
kind
winthrop
she
said
you
may
as
well
save
time
by
driving
on
the
anger
was
rising
in
the
old
gentleman
s
face
he
had
been
defied
for
years
and
had
borne
it
with
fortitude
and
a
measure
of
amusement
he
had
always
felt
that
he
could
assert
himself
when
he
chose
but
now
he
had
chosen
and
apparently
he
had
been
mistaken
all
these
years
his
wife
would
not
obey
it
was
mortifying
and
especially
before
his
son
and
his
sister
he
turned
sharply
to
martha
sitting
frightened
and
meek
in
the
dark
corner
of
the
coach
martha
get
out
he
commanded
in
a
tone
she
had
never
disobeyed
martha
proceeded
to
obey
hastily
don
t
you
do
any
such
foolish
thing
martha
winthrop
you
stay
right
where
you
are
i
won
t
have
any
scenes
said
madam
winthrop
martha
paused
and
put
her
mitted
hand
on
her
heart
martha
this
is
my
carriage
and
you
are
my
sister
and
i
tell
you
to
get
out
martha
had
not
heard
that
voice
from
her
brother
s
lips
for
forty
years
she
got
out
pompey
caesar
the
two
negroes
who
drove
up
at
that
see
that
the
ladies
are
cared
for
in
the
inn
until
our
return
attend
to
the
other
carriage
and
tell
the
young
ladies
it
is
my
wish
that
they
remain
in
the
inn
parlor
until
i
come
back
with
grave
dignity
the
master
of
the
situation
guided
his
horse
past
the
carryall
and
down
the
dim
evening
street
madam
winthrop
sat
amazed
with
two
red
spots
on
her
cheeks
it
seems
to
me
winthrop
she
said
coldly
when
they
had
gone
some
distance
that
you
are
carrying
things
with
a
pretty
high
hand
if
i
had
known
that
such
traits
would
ever
develop
in
you
i
am
sure
i
should
never
have
left
the
shelter
of
my
father
s
house
her
husband
made
no
reply
as
the
coach
drew
up
before
the
fine
old
house
van
rensselaer
came
out
to
greet
the
arrivals
madam
winthrop
sat
up
with
grave
dignity
and
allowed
him
to
hand
her
down
and
escort
her
into
the
house
van
rensselaer
met
her
with
nervous
ceremony
in
the
wide
hall
and
took
her
into
the
stately
parlor
once
there
the
lady
looked
about
her
as
if
in
search
of
some
one
scarcely
noticing
her
hostess
where
is
my
son
she
asked
i
supposed
he
would
be
here
will
you
tell
harrington
that
his
mother
wishes
to
see
him
at
once
it
is
most
important
your
son
has
not
yet
arrived
said
the
other
woman
watching
her
jealously
we
do
not
expect
him
until
the
morning
train
she
mentioned
the
train
with
an
air
of
pride
for
the
new
railroad
was
a
matter
of
vast
importance
to
the
little
city
a
few
miles
of
railroad
was
a
wonderful
distinction
in
a
land
where
railroads
had
just
begun
to
be
but
the
guest
had
no
recognition
for
such
things
not
here
yet
i
supposed
of
course
he
would
have
arrived
then
if
it
is
convenient
i
will
go
directly
to
my
room
as
i
am
very
much
no
thank
you
i
could
not
eat
a
mouthful
you
may
send
me
a
cup
of
tea
if
you
please
dawn
had
fled
in
a
panic
far
into
the
depths
of
the
garden
crouched
behind
the
tall
clipped
hedges
her
heart
beating
wildly
she
listened
while
frightened
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
if
she
had
dared
if
she
had
known
where
to
go
she
would
have
fled
out
into
the
dark
unknown
world
at
that
moment
so
did
her
heart
revolt
at
the
thought
of
her
marriage
she
listened
the
night
was
very
sweet
with
roses
and
honeysuckles
and
faint
waft
of
mignonette
all
about
her
mingled
with
the
breath
of
heliotrope
but
only
the
night
sounds
came
to
plaintive
cricket
monotonously
playing
his
part
in
the
symphony
of
the
evening
the
shrilly
piping
here
and
there
with
the
bass
of
a
frog
in
the
just
below
the
hill
the
coming
in
with
his
obligato
the
murmur
of
the
brook
in
the
ravine
not
far
away
and
the
sighing
of
the
over
all
a
sudden
hush
seemed
to
have
come
over
the
house
with
only
the
faint
echo
of
voices
oh
if
there
were
but
a
place
in
the
world
where
she
might
slip
away
and
never
be
found
it
would
be
terrible
to
leave
them
that
way
with
the
wedding
all
prepared
but
she
would
not
care
what
she
did
if
only
she
might
get
away
from
it
all
the
coach
had
been
sent
to
the
stables
and
the
gentlemen
were
closeted
with
van
rensselaer
in
his
library
the
room
made
memorable
to
dawn
by
so
many
sorrowful
scenes
it
was
right
and
fitting
that
the
revelation
should
be
made
within
the
sombre
walls
where
had
been
enacted
so
many
tragedies
connected
with
the
little
girl
what
passed
within
that
door
no
one
knew
exactly
save
the
three
who
took
part
in
the
conversation
the
lady
of
the
house
sat
in
gloomy
mortification
within
her
stately
parlor
reviewing
with
vexed
mind
the
recent
interview
between
herself
and
the
mother
of
the
bridegroom
van
rensselaer
decided
that
the
other
woman
was
a
most
unpleasant
person
with
whom
she
wished
to
have
as
little
to
do
as
possible
in
future
it
was
well
that
she
and
her
had
little
in
common
if
this
was
the
kind
of
family
she
was
marrying
into
the
low
tones
in
the
library
went
on
the
lady
of
the
house
did
not
like
the
idea
of
being
shut
out
what
could
they
be
talking
about
how
very
strange
had
something
happened
to
the
bridegroom
they
looked
so
solemn
when
they
came
in
van
rensselaer
caught
her
breath
at
the
thought
it
would
be
nothing
short
of
a
catastrophe
to
have
the
on
her
hands
if
the
wedding
were
to
be
delayed
for
any
reason
the
child
was
almost
beside
herself
now
with
excitement
and
nervousness
it
was
positively
uncanny
to
have
her
around
she
was
making
herself
sick
one
could
see
that
at
a
glance
even
if
one
didn
t
love
her
very
much
of
course
she
would
settle
down
and
be
all
right
after
she
was
married
girls
always
did
this
girl
was
particularly
headstrong
and
it
was
as
well
that
her
prospective
husband
was
older
than
herself
and
would
be
able
to
control
her
wild
fancies
and
put
her
through
wise
discipline
van
rensselaer
was
one
of
those
who
think
all
women
save
themselves
need
discipline
while
she
meditated
dawn
flitted
in
at
the
front
door
noiselessly
and
stole
up
the
stair
like
a
wraith
her
white
dress
flashing
by
the
parlor
before
her
could
sense
what
it
was
the
woman
started
angrily
it
was
one
of
the
things
about
the
girl
that
vexed
her
this
stealing
softly
by
and
giving
no
warning
that
she
was
near
her
named
it
slyness
in
a
moment
more
the
library
door
opened
and
her
name
was
called
she
went
into
the
hall
with
an
attitude
that
said
plainly
she
felt
insulted
by
the
way
things
were
going
where
is
jemima
asked
her
husband
and
she
saw
by
his
face
that
something
unusual
had
happened
his
look
was
that
he
had
worn
the
day
he
came
home
from
seeing
his
dead
wife
jemima
indeed
why
did
he
not
consult
her
first
she
bustled
up
to
the
door
jemima
has
gone
to
her
room
she
said
decidedly
by
this
time
she
has
retired
it
would
be
better
not
to
disturb
her
she
has
been
very
nervous
and
excited
all
day
to
the
two
guests
inside
the
library
the
protest
sounded
like
loving
solicitation
perhaps
the
woman
meant
it
should
she
had
been
wont
to
show
her
interest
thus
before
dawn
s
father
and
seldom
let
him
know
her
true
feeling
toward
the
girl
van
rensselaer
s
severe
brow
did
not
relax
he
was
used
to
having
life
thicken
around
him
in
hard
experiences
both
for
himself
and
for
those
who
were
dependent
upon
him
it
will
be
necessary
for
her
to
know
i
think
maria
he
said
sit
down
and
i
will
give
you
the
facts
it
may
be
best
for
you
to
tell
her
after
all
with
the
injured
importance
of
one
who
feels
she
should
have
been
told
at
the
first
van
rensselaer
sat
down
upon
the
extreme
edge
of
a
stiff
chair
grudgingly
not
to
seem
too
eager
to
be
told
maria
winthrop
has
kindly
come
to
inform
us
of
a
most
unfortunate
state
of
things
relating
to
the
young
man
who
was
to
have
married
jemima
morning
van
rensselaer
held
her
breath
and
her
face
actually
blanched
with
the
vision
of
the
future
was
to
have
married
then
something
had
occurred
to
stop
it
her
premonitions
had
been
correct
well
she
would
do
something
to
get
that
whimsical
minx
out
of
her
house
any
way
her
husband
needn
t
think
she
was
to
live
her
lifetime
out
in
the
same
house
with
that
girl
she
set
her
lips
together
hard
in
a
thin
line
of
defence
i
realize
that
the
whole
thing
is
painful
in
the
extreme
to
my
friend
winthrop
so
it
is
not
necessary
for
us
to
discuss
the
matter
at
length
it
is
sufficient
for
you
and
my
daughter
to
know
that
it
has
been
discovered
by
winthrop
that
his
son
harrington
is
already
married
to
a
woman
who
is
still
living
and
who
is
the
mother
of
his
two
children
the
situation
is
most
embarrassing
on
both
sides
and
it
will
be
necessary
for
my
daughter
to
understand
it
at
once
there
was
a
quick
eager
movement
of
the
young
man
on
the
other
side
of
the
big
desk
but
no
one
noticed
him
van
rensselaer
was
perhaps
the
only
one
in
the
room
whose
heart
was
not
wrung
with
the
anguish
of
the
moment
a
most
unpleasant
state
of
things
winthrop
she
said
sharply
turning
to
the
elder
guest
the
old
man
bowed
his
head
in
assent
too
overcome
to
reply
but
one
for
which
winthrop
and
his
family
are
in
no
wise
to
blame
of
course
said
van
rensselaer
quickly
i
suppose
not
said
his
wife
dryly
in
a
tone
which
implied
that
there
was
more
than
one
way
of
looking
at
the
matter
the
first
thing
is
to
tell
jemima
said
her
father
i
m
sure
i
don
t
in
the
least
see
why
responded
his
wife
the
first
thing
is
to
plan
what
is
to
be
done
jemima
is
far
better
off
asleep
until
we
arrange
it
all
she
will
make
a
fuss
of
course
girls
always
make
a
fuss
whatever
happens
charles
eyed
the
woman
indignantly
the
color
rising
in
his
face
but
van
rensselaer
he
began
eagerly
yes
certainly
winthrop
i
am
coming
to
that
there
is
another
matter
maria
that
slightly
changes
the
affair
this
young
man
charles
winthrop
has
most
thoughtfully
offered
a
suggestion
which
may
help
us
out
of
the
dilemma
in
which
we
are
all
placed
van
rensselaer
turned
toward
him
sharply
and
saw
that
he
was
good
to
look
upon
well
she
said
dryly
as
her
husband
hesitated
if
miss
van
rensselaer
is
willing
put
in
charles
shyly
with
wistful
eyes
and
a
smile
that
would
have
melted
any
but
a
woman
with
a
heart
made
of
pig
iron
van
rensselaer
pursed
her
lips
at
the
miss
applied
to
jemima
and
thought
in
her
heart
she
would
see
that
miss
van
rensselaer
was
willing
for
anything
that
would
help
them
out
of
this
most
embarrassing
situation
winthrop
has
offered
his
hand
to
my
daughter
went
on
the
father
dropping
his
eyes
and
getting
out
the
sentence
stiffly
it
was
all
painful
to
him
somehow
in
the
last
few
minutes
it
had
come
to
him
that
she
who
had
been
mary
montgomery
would
think
he
had
bungled
her
daughter
s
life
most
terribly
he
was
shaken
with
the
thought
it
had
been
a
relief
to
think
that
the
girl
was
to
be
happily
married
but
now
he
proposes
to
marry
her
himself
morning
at
the
hour
appointed
for
the
other
marriage
went
on
van
rensselaer
with
her
consent
of
course
put
in
charles
very
commendable
i
m
sure
commented
van
rensselaer
while
she
did
some
rapid
thinking
here
was
her
chance
the
girl
must
marry
this
young
man
whether
she
would
or
no
all
those
relatives
who
were
coming
should
not
have
a
chance
to
scoff
at
her
proud
arrangements
the
desired
that
they
should
all
see
how
well
she
had
done
for
the
girl
who
was
not
her
own
besides
he
was
a
goodly
youth
full
as
handsome
as
the
other
man
and
of
the
same
family
what
was
there
to
object
to
the
girl
might
even
be
pleased
though
there
was
no
forecasting
that
such
a
queer
girl
would
probably
do
the
opposite
from
what
was
expected
of
her
the
matter
with
her
was
that
she
was
too
young
to
know
what
she
did
want
and
in
the
present
circumstances
it
was
best
for
her
that
some
one
else
should
decide
her
fate
van
decide
it
she
would
take
matters
into
her
own
hands
and
see
that
all
went
the
way
it
should
go
meantime
she
picked
at
a
bit
of
thread
on
her
immaculate
gown
and
to
make
time
for
thought
murmured
again
most
commendable
i
m
sure
charles
s
face
lighted
with
hope
he
was
ready
to
fall
upon
the
lady
s
neck
and
embrace
her
if
that
would
hasten
matters
he
thought
she
looked
more
pleasing
than
when
he
had
first
seen
her
i
think
van
rensselaer
you
would
do
well
to
leave
this
matter
in
my
hands
now
as
you
say
it
is
a
very
delicate
situation
and
one
that
must
be
handled
most
carefully
i
will
go
to
jemima
at
once
and
talk
with
her
i
must
break
the
news
of
course
of
poor
lamb
murmured
the
kind
old
father
of
the
reprobate
bridegroom
she
is
very
nervous
and
quite
unstrung
with
the
day
s
preparation
went
on
the
the
more
to
work
her
will
upon
the
feelings
of
those
present
of
course
of
child
don
t
distress
her
any
more
than
is
necessary
i
beg
it
is
dreadful
for
her
dreadful
but
it
isn
t
quite
as
if
she
had
never
seen
me
put
in
charles
wistfully
tell
her
i
have
loved
her
from
the
very
first
sight
i
had
of
the
woman
turned
the
chilly
of
her
eyes
upon
the
young
man
s
ardent
face
and
a
sense
of
foreboding
passed
over
him
poor
soul
she
was
only
wondering
what
it
must
be
like
to
have
some
one
talk
in
that
way
about
one
still
she
was
keen
to
see
an
advantage
and
knew
it
would
help
her
in
the
task
she
had
set
herself
to
get
rid
of
her
whatever
you
think
best
maria
assented
dawn
s
father
wearily
he
was
glad
after
all
not
to
have
to
tell
the
girl
he
had
come
to
fear
her
eyes
which
were
like
her
mother
s
and
her
temper
which
was
his
own
of
course
of
course
said
old
winthrop
dawn
s
father
bowed
once
more
his
assent
in
his
heart
he
heard
again
the
words
you
have
no
right
you
have
no
right
would
the
sin
of
his
youth
never
be
expiated
by
sorrow
van
rensselaer
arose
i
will
go
up
and
talk
with
her
she
said
coolly
as
though
it
were
quite
an
ordinary
matter
under
discussion
you
will
ask
her
to
come
down
and
let
me
talk
to
her
asked
charles
following
her
into
the
hall
i
think
perhaps
i
can
make
her
see
it
better
than
any
one
else
the
woman
looked
him
over
frowning
this
ardent
youth
was
going
to
be
hard
to
control
she
must
be
wary
or
he
would
upset
all
her
plans
as
well
as
his
own
i
will
see
what
is
best
she
answered
coldly
remember
she
has
retired
and
this
will
be
a
great
shock
to
her
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
give
her
a
little
time
to
recover
and
to
think
it
over
leave
it
to
me
i
will
do
my
best
for
you
she
tried
to
smile
but
conveyed
rather
an
expression
of
arrogance
than
of
anything
else
of
course
the
young
man
drew
back
thoughtfully
do
not
hurry
her
she
passed
up
the
stairs
and
charles
wandered
out
the
front
door
and
into
the
moonlit
garden
he
stood
and
listened
to
the
harmony
of
sound
and
looked
up
reverently
toward
a
chamber
window
where
glimmered
a
he
wondered
if
even
now
she
was
listening
to
his
message
and
his
heart
was
lifted
high
with
hope
chapter
ix
when
van
rensselaer
came
down
stairs
a
later
she
found
charles
in
the
parlor
anxiously
awaiting
her
coming
her
face
was
bland
and
encouraging
she
tried
to
smile
though
smiles
were
foreign
to
her
nature
well
she
said
seating
herself
and
signing
to
the
young
man
to
take
a
chair
opposite
her
she
is
naturally
very
much
shocked
of
course
she
would
be
said
charles
somewhat
sadly
and
waited
i
think
as
i
said
it
will
take
her
a
few
hours
to
become
adjusted
to
the
new
state
of
things
and
it
would
not
be
well
for
you
to
see
her
there
will
be
plenty
of
time
in
the
morning
the
hour
was
set
late
so
that
all
the
relatives
could
arrive
you
know
she
will
undoubtedly
accept
your
proposal
but
you
must
give
her
a
little
time
you
think
she
will
asked
the
young
man
brightening
oh
that
is
good
certainly
i
can
wait
until
morning
poor
little
girl
it
must
be
very
hard
for
her
a
hard
glitter
in
his
hostess
s
eye
did
not
encourage
conversation
along
these
lines
and
he
soon
excused
himself
to
go
and
meet
his
father
who
had
gone
to
the
inn
to
see
that
the
rest
of
the
family
were
comfortable
for
the
night
the
household
settled
to
quiet
at
last
but
it
was
like
the
sullen
silence
before
a
storm
a
heavy
burden
had
fallen
upon
van
rensselaer
he
seemed
to
be
arraigned
before
his
first
wife
s
searching
eyes
for
the
trouble
that
had
befallen
their
child
he
could
not
get
away
from
the
vision
of
her
dead
face
his
wife
spent
the
night
in
feverish
planning
for
the
morning
a
fiendish
determination
in
her
heart
to
be
rid
of
her
no
matter
to
what
she
had
to
resort
in
order
to
compass
it
winthrop
had
leisure
now
to
think
upon
his
oldest
son
and
the
sin
which
he
had
been
about
to
commit
and
tears
trickled
down
his
cheeks
as
he
watched
through
the
long
hours
of
the
night
his
wife
vouchsafed
him
no
word
or
look
to
all
appearances
she
was
asleep
but
no
one
ever
knew
what
struggles
were
going
on
within
her
soul
perhaps
she
was
holding
herself
in
abeyance
for
the
coming
of
the
beloved
son
who
would
explain
all
in
the
spacious
chamber
assigned
to
him
charles
spent
much
of
the
night
in
a
vision
with
a
girl
upon
a
hillside
and
his
waking
visions
and
those
sleeping
were
so
blended
that
he
was
scarce
aware
when
starlight
merged
into
morning
and
he
heard
the
birds
twitter
in
the
branches
near
his
window
of
all
that
household
only
dawn
slept
her
heart
bowed
with
its
burden
of
apprehension
had
reached
the
limit
of
endurance
and
the
long
lashes
lay
still
upon
the
white
cheeks
while
her
soul
ceased
from
its
troubling
for
a
little
while
she
awoke
with
a
start
of
painful
realization
while
yet
the
first
crimson
streak
of
morning
lay
in
the
east
its
rosy
light
reminded
her
of
the
day
and
what
it
was
to
mean
for
her
with
a
sound
that
was
like
both
a
sob
and
a
prayer
she
rose
quickly
and
slipping
on
the
little
white
gown
she
had
worn
the
evening
before
nor
stopping
to
do
more
than
brush
out
the
mass
of
curls
she
hastened
stealthily
down
the
stairs
and
taking
care
to
close
the
door
behind
her
that
her
escape
should
not
be
noticed
went
out
into
the
garden
she
would
slip
back
quietly
before
the
guests
were
astir
she
told
herself
she
wanted
one
more
hour
to
herself
in
the
dewy
garden
before
life
shut
her
in
forever
from
freedom
and
her
girlhood
five
minutes
later
her
in
and
slippers
crossed
the
hall
hastily
and
pushed
open
the
girl
s
door
she
had
fallen
asleep
toward
morning
and
had
slept
later
than
she
had
intended
but
she
had
her
plans
carefully
laid
and
determined
to
settle
the
girl
s
part
before
any
one
was
up
at
that
same
instant
charles
whose
heart
was
alive
for
the
possibilities
of
the
new
day
stepped
out
on
the
balcony
in
front
of
his
window
and
with
easy
agility
swung
himself
over
the
railing
and
dropped
to
the
terrace
beneath
he
was
too
impatient
to
sleep
longer
and
felt
that
somehow
he
would
be
nearer
his
heart
s
desire
if
he
got
out
into
the
dewy
morning
world
he
walked
slowly
down
the
carefully
tended
paths
into
the
garden
stopping
to
notice
a
bird
s
note
here
the
glint
of
over
the
lawn
the
newly
opened
flowers
in
the
beds
of
poppies
bachelor
buttons
foxglove
asters
and
a
great
thorny
branch
that
must
have
evaded
the
gardener
s
careful
training
reached
out
as
if
to
catch
his
attention
and
there
upon
its
tip
was
a
spray
of
delicate
buds
just
half
blown
exquisite
as
an
angel
s
wings
and
with
the
warm
glow
of
the
sunrise
in
the
sheathlike
curling
petals
were
they
white
or
pink
or
yellow
a
warm
white
living
and
tender
like
a
maiden
s
cheek
he
reached
for
the
spray
and
cut
it
off
feeling
sure
he
could
make
his
peace
with
the
mistress
of
the
house
when
he
confessed
his
theft
he
stood
a
moment
looking
at
the
beautiful
roses
one
almost
full
blown
the
other
two
just
curling
apart
like
a
baby
trying
to
waken
he
drank
in
their
fragrance
in
a
long
deep
breath
and
then
thinking
his
fanciful
thoughts
of
the
girl
to
whom
he
had
given
his
heart
so
freely
before
he
yet
knew
her
he
walked
slowly
on
to
the
little
arbor
hid
among
the
yew
trees
van
rensselaer
stood
in
the
doorway
of
dawn
s
room
aghast
scarcely
able
to
believe
her
eyes
yes
the
girl
was
gone
where
was
her
instant
thought
perhaps
she
had
fled
and
would
make
them
more
trouble
a
great
fear
clutched
at
the
woman
s
heart
lest
she
had
made
a
terrible
mistake
by
not
talking
the
matter
over
with
her
the
night
before
and
making
her
understand
what
she
was
to
do
now
perhaps
it
would
be
found
out
by
them
all
and
by
her
husband
in
particular
that
she
had
not
yet
told
the
girl
anything
van
rensselaer
had
a
decided
fear
of
her
husband
their
wills
had
never
really
clashed
so
far
but
for
some
years
she
had
had
a
feeling
that
if
they
ever
did
he
would
be
terrible
she
shrank
back
with
a
wild
heating
of
her
heart
and
looked
about
the
shadowy
hall
as
if
she
expected
to
find
the
girl
lurking
there
then
her
stern
came
to
the
surface
and
she
went
boldly
into
the
room
and
made
a
systematic
search
it
did
not
take
but
a
minute
to
make
sure
that
dawn
was
not
there
and
that
wherever
she
was
she
had
taken
nothing
with
her
save
the
clothes
she
had
worn
the
evening
before
it
suddenly
occurred
to
the
that
she
ought
to
have
gone
into
the
room
before
retiring
last
night
and
made
sure
that
her
charge
was
there
but
so
sure
had
she
been
that
she
had
heard
dawn
come
in
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
to
do
it
besides
where
could
the
girl
go
she
was
very
likely
maundering
about
that
dull
old
garden
she
had
haunted
ever
since
her
return
from
school
with
that
van
rensselaer
looked
out
of
the
window
just
in
time
to
catch
sight
of
her
young
guest
cutting
the
roses
with
keen
apprehension
she
saw
what
might
be
about
to
happen
and
knew
that
instant
action
was
the
only
thing
that
could
prevent
a
catastrophe
regardless
of
and
slippers
and
of
the
which
concealed
her
scant
twist
of
hair
she
descended
the
stairs
strode
out
the
front
door
and
down
the
garden
path
coming
in
sight
of
the
young
man
just
as
he
turned
the
corner
of
the
yew
hedge
into
the
walk
that
led
into
the
green
arbor
charles
stopped
suddenly
for
there
sat
dawn
in
her
little
white
gown
with
her
head
bowed
upon
her
arms
on
the
rustic
table
and
her
wealth
of
dark
curls
covering
her
her
young
frame
shook
with
sobbing
yet
so
quietly
did
she
weep
that
he
had
not
heard
her
her
ear
alert
with
apprehension
caught
the
sound
of
his
foot
upon
the
gravel
and
she
raised
her
head
as
suddenly
as
he
had
stopped
she
looked
at
him
with
frightened
eyes
out
of
which
the
tears
had
fled
down
her
white
cheeks
the
face
was
full
of
anguish
yet
sweet
and
pitiful
withal
framed
in
its
ripple
of
dark
hair
one
instant
she
looked
at
him
as
if
he
were
a
vision
from
whence
she
could
not
tell
then
that
great
light
grew
in
her
eyes
as
he
had
seen
it
on
the
hillside
and
before
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
he
had
smiled
then
the
light
in
her
eyes
grew
into
an
answering
smile
and
lit
up
her
whole
beautiful
sorrowful
face
it
was
like
a
rainbow
in
the
pale
dawn
of
the
morning
that
smile
with
the
still
upon
her
lashes
jemima
what
on
earth
broke
in
the
harsh
voice
of
her
you
certainly
do
take
the
craziest
notions
you
out
here
in
that
rig
at
this
time
in
the
morning
i
guess
you
didn
t
count
on
company
rising
early
too
and
your
hair
not
combed
either
i
certainly
am
mortified
run
in
quick
and
get
tidied
up
there
s
plenty
to
do
this
morning
without
mooning
in
the
garden
you
ll
excuse
her
the
guest
she
had
no
idea
any
one
else
would
be
out
here
so
early
the
smile
had
gone
from
the
girl
s
face
and
instead
the
fright
had
come
back
at
sound
of
her
tormentor
s
jangling
voice
she
looked
down
at
her
little
rumpled
frock
put
back
her
hair
with
trembling
hand
and
a
flood
of
sweet
shamed
color
came
into
the
white
face
just
as
the
sun
burst
up
behind
the
hedge
and
touched
the
green
with
rosy
morning
brightness
without
a
word
in
reply
she
turned
to
go
but
her
eyes
met
those
of
charles
with
a
pleading
that
went
to
his
heart
and
his
eyes
answered
unspeakable
things
of
which
neither
knew
the
meaning
though
each
felt
the
strange
joy
they
brought
as
he
stood
back
to
let
her
pass
he
held
out
to
her
the
spray
of
lovely
rosebuds
and
without
a
word
she
took
them
and
went
swiftly
on
into
the
house
not
a
word
had
passed
between
them
yet
each
felt
that
something
wonderful
had
happened
dawn
looked
neither
to
right
nor
to
left
fearing
lest
she
should
see
some
one
less
welcome
and
so
she
fled
to
her
room
with
the
sound
of
her
s
clanging
voice
uttering
some
commonplaces
about
the
morning
and
the
garden
floating
to
her
in
indistinct
waves
you
will
let
me
see
her
now
just
as
soon
as
she
is
ready
to
come
down
charles
asked
eagerly
at
the
door
i
will
talk
with
her
at
once
and
let
you
know
what
she
says
answered
the
vexed
lady
evasively
she
was
all
out
of
breath
and
flurried
with
the
anxiety
lest
she
had
been
too
late
it
had
been
a
narrow
escape
she
did
not
like
to
begin
an
important
day
like
this
with
being
flustered
besides
she
had
become
conscious
of
her
the
ugly
lines
of
her
the
of
her
slippers
a
long
wisp
of
hair
had
escaped
from
her
cap
and
was
tickling
her
nose
as
she
ascended
the
stairs
with
as
much
dignity
as
the
circumstances
and
her
slippers
allowed
in
full
sight
of
the
ardent
lover
well
jemima
van
rensselaer
i
hope
you
re
satisfied
she
flared
out
as
soon
as
she
was
inside
the
girl
s
door
what
on
earth
took
you
out
in
the
wet
at
this
unearthly
hour
and
on
your
wedding
day
too
i
should
think
you
d
be
ashamed
i
declare
i
shall
be
glad
to
my
soul
when
this
day
s
over
and
i
can
wash
my
hands
of
the
responsibility
of
you
if
your
father
knew
the
freaks
and
fancies
and
the
queer
actions
of
you
i
m
not
sure
what
he
wouldn
t
do
to
you
now
look
here
sit
down
i
want
to
talk
to
you
but
dawn
had
flung
herself
upon
her
bed
in
a
paroxysm
of
tears
and
was
smothering
her
wild
sobs
in
the
pillow
she
did
not
hear
a
word
nor
could
threats
nor
protests
nor
even
a
thorough
shaking
bring
her
out
of
it
until
the
tears
had
wept
themselves
out
but
finally
she
lay
quiet
and
white
upon
the
bed
and
even
the
woman
who
did
not
love
her
was
stirred
to
a
sort
of
pity
for
the
abject
woe
that
was
upon
her
face
say
look
here
jemima
the
hated
name
brought
forth
no
sign
from
the
now
put
away
all
this
foolishness
girls
always
feel
kind
of
queer
at
getting
married
and
making
a
change
in
life
i
did
myself
dawn
wondered
indifferently
if
her
had
ever
been
a
girl
she
certainly
had
not
been
one
when
she
married
dawn
s
father
you
ll
feel
all
right
once
you
get
in
your
own
home
and
have
things
the
way
you
want
them
around
you
dawn
shuddered
she
would
have
around
her
now
do
get
up
and
wash
your
face
a
bride
oughtn
t
to
look
as
if
she
was
just
getting
over
the
measles
besides
you
ll
be
wanted
pretty
soon
to
go
oh
dawn
involuntarily
put
her
hand
over
her
heart
must
i
go
down
and
see
all
those
dreadful
people
couldn
t
i
just
stay
here
it
s
time
now
this
was
exactly
what
van
rensselaer
wanted
her
to
say
and
moreover
had
been
counting
upon
if
dawn
had
assented
to
going
down
her
would
have
found
some
excuse
for
keeping
her
upstairs
but
she
did
not
wish
the
girl
to
know
it
so
she
assumed
a
look
of
mild
disapproval
it
s
very
queer
for
you
not
to
want
to
meet
your
and
and
all
your
new
dawn
shuddered
more
violently
and
clasped
her
hands
quickly
over
her
eyes
as
if
to
shut
out
the
unpleasant
vision
of
her
new
kindred
oh
no
no
please
she
besought
looking
up
at
her
with
more
earnest
pleading
than
she
had
ever
shown
her
before
well
i
suppose
it
can
be
managed
but
you
ll
want
to
have
a
talk
with
him
that
s
so
soon
to
be
your
oh
no
no
cried
dawn
wildly
i
do
not
want
to
see
him
i
can
not
talk
with
him
now
i
could
never
never
go
through
that
awful
ceremony
afterward
if
i
were
to
see
him
now
i
should
run
away
or
something
i
m
sure
i
should
i
don
t
want
to
see
anybody
until
i
have
to
he
ll
think
it
very
strange
i
don
t
see
how
i
can
explain
it
he
s
very
anxious
to
talk
to
you
he
sent
you
a
message
last
night
but
you
were
asleep
so
that
was
what
the
knock
had
meant
dawn
was
glad
she
had
not
answered
it
oh
please
please
she
said
clasping
her
hands
in
the
attitude
of
pleading
couldn
t
you
just
explain
to
him
that
i
m
a
very
silly
girl
but
i
should
like
just
these
last
few
minutes
to
myself
tell
him
that
if
he
has
any
message
please
to
tell
it
to
you
and
to
let
me
be
by
myself
now
tell
him
he
doesn
t
know
how
a
girl
feels
when
she
is
going
to
stop
being
a
girl
tell
him
please
that
if
he
has
any
sympathy
for
me
at
all
he
won
t
ask
to
see
me
now
it
is
only
a
little
while
and
i
want
it
to
myself
her
great
pleading
eyes
met
van
rensselaer
s
cold
gaze
and
her
whole
slender
figure
took
an
attitude
of
intense
wistfulness
the
elder
woman
cold
and
unloving
as
she
was
could
not
but
acknowledge
that
the
girl
was
very
beautiful
her
heart
might
have
been
touched
more
had
it
not
been
for
the
gnawing
thought
that
this
child
s
mother
had
been
the
which
had
blighted
the
s
whole
life
she
turned
grimly
from
the
girl
well
content
that
her
plans
were
coming
out
as
she
desired
yet
not
entirely
comfortable
in
mind
or
conscience
almost
she
determined
to
risk
telling
the
girl
everything
yet
dared
not
lest
she
utterly
refuse
to
be
married
even
at
this
late
hour
well
i
suppose
you
must
have
your
own
way
you
always
have
she
said
grimly
dawn
wondered
when
i
ll
do
my
best
to
explain
your
state
of
mind
continued
van
rensselaer
though
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
how
he
ll
take
it
it
s
my
opinion
he
isn
t
going
to
have
a
bed
of
roses
through
life
being
a
husband
to
you
any
way
and
i
suppose
he
may
as
well
begin
to
learn
with
which
unsympathetic
remark
she
went
heavily
out
of
the
girl
s
room
and
into
her
own
where
she
speedily
got
herself
into
her
wedding
garments
a
red
spot
burned
in
either
sallow
cheek
but
her
mouth
wore
the
line
of
victory
so
far
she
had
carried
out
her
schemes
well
chapter
x
at
breakfast
time
as
the
other
guests
were
coming
downstairs
van
rensselaer
beckoned
charles
inside
the
door
and
gave
him
his
message
in
a
low
tone
it
will
be
all
right
winthrop
your
offer
will
be
accepted
gratefully
but
she
asks
you
to
be
kind
enough
to
leave
her
to
herself
until
the
time
for
the
ceremony
she
is
so
much
shaken
by
this
whole
thing
that
she
is
afraid
to
talk
about
it
lest
it
will
unnerve
her
she
says
she
does
not
need
to
talk
it
over
that
you
are
very
kind
and
if
you
have
any
message
you
can
send
it
by
me
after
breakfast
thank
you
thank
you
said
charles
his
face
bright
with
the
joy
of
knowing
that
his
strange
suit
had
been
successful
he
was
disappointed
of
course
not
to
see
the
girl
at
once
but
it
would
not
be
long
before
she
was
his
wife
and
he
could
talk
with
her
as
much
as
he
pleased
after
all
there
was
something
wonderful
in
her
trusting
him
enough
to
marry
him
when
she
had
seen
him
but
twice
had
she
perhaps
had
the
same
feeling
about
him
that
he
had
about
her
had
that
been
the
explanation
of
the
light
in
her
eyes
these
thoughts
played
a
happy
trill
in
his
heart
as
he
greeted
his
father
and
mother
and
seated
himself
at
the
table
all
through
the
meal
he
was
planning
the
message
he
would
send
to
his
beloved
when
her
had
left
the
room
dawn
had
fastened
the
door
securely
against
all
intrusion
she
was
determined
to
have
to
herself
what
little
time
was
left
on
the
couch
under
her
window
was
spread
the
beautiful
frock
which
her
had
prepared
for
her
to
wear
it
was
of
white
satin
rich
and
elaborate
and
encrusted
with
much
beautiful
lace
which
had
been
in
her
father
s
family
for
years
and
was
yellow
with
age
it
was
traditional
that
all
the
brides
of
the
house
had
worn
these
rare
laces
dawn
hated
the
frock
and
the
lace
she
would
much
rather
have
worn
a
simple
muslin
of
her
own
mother
but
as
the
marriage
was
not
to
her
taste
why
should
her
dress
be
either
what
mattered
it
let
them
all
have
their
way
with
her
van
rensselaer
had
taken
much
pride
in
preparing
the
beautiful
garments
but
dawn
knew
why
she
knew
that
it
was
for
others
to
look
upon
so
that
they
would
praise
the
for
having
been
so
good
to
the
child
who
had
been
thrust
upon
her
care
under
circumstances
which
to
put
it
mildly
were
unpleasant
it
spoke
of
no
loving
kindness
toward
her
and
so
dawn
did
not
go
over
to
the
couch
as
many
another
girl
might
have
done
to
examine
again
the
filmy
garments
the
silk
stockings
and
the
dainty
satin
slippers
sewed
over
with
that
were
also
an
heirloom
in
the
family
they
meant
to
her
nothing
but
signs
of
her
coming
bondage
instead
she
went
to
the
little
mahogany
stand
where
she
had
placed
in
a
tall
pitcher
her
spray
of
rosebuds
she
bent
over
to
take
in
their
delicate
fragrance
and
the
eyes
of
him
who
had
given
them
to
her
seemed
to
be
looking
into
her
soul
again
as
twice
they
had
looked
before
it
was
a
strange
she
thought
of
it
afterward
many
she
did
not
yet
know
who
he
was
and
had
never
stopped
to
question
it
had
not
even
occurred
to
her
to
wonder
if
he
were
a
relative
or
only
a
friend
or
how
he
came
to
be
in
her
home
she
accepted
him
as
she
would
have
accepted
a
respite
in
some
quiet
place
for
her
fevered
spirit
or
the
visit
of
an
angel
with
a
message
of
strength
from
heaven
she
had
a
vague
feeling
that
if
he
had
come
before
things
might
have
been
different
she
knelt
beside
the
stand
and
let
her
hot
cheek
rest
against
a
cool
bud
she
touched
her
lips
to
another
and
then
laid
the
roses
on
her
eyelids
it
seemed
almost
like
a
pitying
human
hand
upon
her
spirit
and
comforted
her
tired
heart
she
felt
that
she
was
growing
old
very
very
old
in
these
last
few
hours
to
meet
the
requirements
of
her
wedding
day
and
the
touch
of
the
buds
seemed
to
steady
and
help
her
as
her
mother
s
hand
and
lips
might
have
done
by
and
by
she
would
have
to
get
up
and
put
on
those
fine
garments
lying
over
there
in
the
morning
sunlight
and
go
downstairs
for
them
all
to
stare
at
her
misery
but
now
she
would
forget
it
all
for
a
little
while
and
just
think
of
her
friend
who
had
looked
at
her
with
such
a
wonderful
smile
in
which
there
seemed
no
place
for
or
sternness
or
grim
things
which
had
seemed
to
make
up
the
main
part
of
her
girlhood
life
meantime
winthrop
and
his
host
had
gone
to
meet
the
train
upon
which
the
expectant
bridegroom
would
arrive
as
they
neared
the
tavern
that
served
as
a
station
for
the
new
railroad
they
saw
an
old
man
a
woman
and
two
little
children
sitting
upon
a
settle
on
the
front
stoop
the
man
arose
and
came
a
step
or
two
toward
them
and
winthrop
saw
that
it
was
william
mccord
he
seemed
embarrassed
and
he
spoke
apologetically
winthrop
sir
i
don
t
jest
know
what
you
ll
think
about
me
bein
don
t
and
i
m
sorry
s
i
can
be
about
it
but
you
see
i
knowed
harrington
pretty
well
i
knowed
he
might
find
a
way
to
smooth
it
all
over
and
pull
the
wool
over
your
eyes
and
i
d
passed
my
word
i
d
come
here
with
her
and
stop
the
marriage
if
so
be
it
turned
out
you
couldn
t
or
wouldn
t
feel
called
upon
to
do
so
i
didn
t
count
on
your
comin
down
to
the
train
you
see
we
ben
watchin
every
train
sence
yesterday
to
make
sure
he
didn
t
get
away
to
the
house
without
our
seein
him
that
poor
girl
there
ain
t
et
scarce
a
mouthful
sence
she
started
from
just
a
drop
o
coffee
now
an
she
ain
t
slep
neither
she
s
jest
keepin
alive
to
hunt
him
up
and
try
to
persuade
him
to
come
home
to
her
an
the
children
you
see
i
had
to
let
her
come
i
couldn
t
say
no
she
was
up
here
day
fore
yesterday
when
i
come
to
see
you
she
didn
t
want
i
should
tell
you
because
she
ain
t
got
the
clo
es
and
fixin
s
she
d
like
to
hev
you
see
her
in
but
she
was
determined
to
he
paused
and
looked
back
toward
the
bench
where
the
woman
and
the
children
sat
winthrop
s
face
had
taken
on
a
look
of
distress
as
he
recognized
william
mccord
he
turned
to
his
companion
and
explained
in
a
low
tone
this
is
the
man
who
brought
me
the
evidence
van
rensselaer
regarded
the
man
with
keen
eyes
and
decided
at
once
that
any
word
from
a
man
with
such
a
face
was
as
good
as
an
affidavit
when
william
looked
toward
the
woman
her
worn
face
flamed
crimson
then
turned
deadly
white
again
she
must
have
been
unusually
pretty
not
so
very
many
years
ago
but
sorrow
toil
and
poverty
had
left
their
ineradicable
marks
upon
her
face
and
stripped
her
of
all
claim
to
beauty
now
her
dress
was
plain
and
as
neat
as
could
be
expected
under
the
circumstances
her
roughened
hair
showed
an
attempt
to
put
it
into
order
and
her
eyes
looked
as
though
she
had
not
slept
for
many
nights
in
spite
of
her
shrinking
there
was
a
dignity
about
her
the
bony
hand
that
held
the
youngest
child
wore
a
wedding
ring
now
much
too
large
for
the
finger
the
oldest
child
a
girl
apparently
of
five
had
yellow
hair
and
rather
bold
blue
eyes
that
reminded
winthrop
startlingly
of
his
eldest
son
s
when
he
was
a
small
boy
the
youngest
a
sallow
sickly
boy
looked
like
his
mother
the
kindly
face
of
winthrop
was
overspread
with
trouble
but
he
grasped
the
humbler
man
s
hand
warmly
that
s
all
right
william
he
said
heartily
i
suppose
she
felt
she
must
come
and
there
s
no
harm
done
only
for
our
friend
van
rensselaer
s
sake
keep
the
matter
as
quiet
as
possible
certainly
certainly
winthrop
and
thank
you
sir
said
the
old
man
gratefully
then
he
looked
questioningly
toward
the
woman
and
took
a
step
in
her
direction
alberty
this
here
is
his
father
said
william
mccord
and
withdrew
hastily
van
rensselaer
at
once
engaged
him
in
earnest
conversation
giving
the
other
man
opportunity
to
talk
with
his
unknown
without
being
observed
the
woman
looked
up
abashed
into
the
kindly
eyes
bent
upon
her
yet
she
felt
the
right
was
on
her
side
and
she
had
no
need
to
quail
before
any
one
it
has
given
me
great
sorrow
madam
to
learn
of
my
son
s
behavior
he
began
it
is
particularly
distressing
to
us
because
he
is
our
first
born
and
deeply
loved
by
us
he
paused
overcome
by
his
emotion
and
the
woman
who
looked
as
if
she
had
long
ago
shed
all
the
tears
she
had
to
shed
glanced
up
wonderingly
and
said
in
a
voice
that
betrayed
her
lack
of
culture
yes
that
s
one
trouble
with
him
folks
always
like
him
too
well
he
thinks
he
can
do
anything
he
wants
and
it
won
t
make
no
diff
runce
but
he
can
t
go
no
further
with
me
i
ve
jest
made
up
my
mind
to
take
a
stand
even
ef
i
have
to
go
to
that
rich
girl
and
show
her
them
childern
the
father
in
him
almost
shuddered
at
the
vernacular
of
what
could
harrington
have
been
thinking
when
he
married
this
who
had
been
brought
up
amid
the
refinements
of
life
and
been
almost
too
sensitive
to
unpleasant
things
it
was
the
old
story
of
a
pretty
face
and
a
boy
far
from
home
and
acquaintances
with
no
one
to
advise
and
no
danger
of
being
found
out
i
used
to
like
him
a
lot
myself
went
on
the
tired
voice
an
i
might
even
yet
ef
he
d
behave
himself
and
stay
home
an
pervide
good
fer
us
like
he
used
to
there
was
a
pleasant
drawl
to
her
tone
like
a
weary
child
s
the
father
s
heart
was
touched
has
my
son
sent
you
money
during
his
absences
the
question
had
to
be
asked
but
it
cut
the
old
gentleman
to
the
heart
to
speak
the
words
she
turned
dull
eyes
on
him
never
a
cent
he
always
said
he
was
havin
a
hard
time
to
get
money
enough
to
keep
goin
business
was
so
bad
but
i
look
notice
he
was
dressed
up
good
and
smart
every
time
he
come
home
which
wa
n
t
often
she
sighed
as
if
it
did
not
matter
much
i
could
stand
it
all
she
began
again
in
her
monotonous
tone
but
i
can
t
stand
him
gettin
married
again
it
ain
t
right
and
it
ain
t
the
law
an
i
knew
ef
i
didn
t
stop
it
nobody
would
so
i
come
on
that
was
right
sighed
the
old
gentleman
fumbling
in
his
pocket
perfectly
right
here
i
want
you
to
take
this
with
you
he
handed
her
a
roll
of
bills
but
she
drew
back
a
red
spot
coming
in
either
sallow
cheek
i
ain
t
an
object
of
charity
thank
you
i
put
a
mortgage
on
pap
s
shack
to
git
the
money
to
come
out
here
but
when
i
get
back
i
ve
got
plenty
of
work
an
i
can
pay
it
off
in
a
year
or
so
this
is
not
charity
said
the
disconcerted
old
gentleman
this
belongs
to
you
i
often
lend
harrington
money
and
sometimes
give
him
some
and
this
was
to
be
given
to
him
i
think
it
is
safer
with
you
he
can
work
for
his
own
after
this
and
i
will
see
that
all
i
should
have
given
him
comes
to
your
hands
i
have
your
address
take
it
for
the
children
i
guess
i
have
a
right
to
give
something
to
my
own
grandchildren
he
said
with
a
great
stretch
of
his
pride
looking
down
at
the
two
forlorn
little
specimens
of
childhood
hiding
half
frightened
behind
their
mother
s
skirts
the
woman
melted
at
once
the
first
warm
tinge
of
life
springing
into
her
eyes
at
the
mention
of
her
children
as
his
relatives
oh
if
you
put
it
that
way
i
ll
take
it
o
course
it
ain
t
no
fault
of
theirs
that
their
father
don
t
do
right
by
me
and
they
do
need
a
sight
of
things
i
can
t
manage
to
get
anyhow
last
winter
harry
was
sick
for
four
s
named
after
his
pa
harry
is
she
pushed
his
hair
fondly
out
of
his
eyes
and
moistening
her
fingers
at
her
lips
rubbed
vigorously
at
a
black
streak
on
harry
s
nose
at
which
he
as
vigorously
protested
but
the
train
was
near
at
hand
even
then
the
distant
rumble
of
its
wheels
could
be
heard
van
rensselaer
and
william
mccord
drew
near
the
latter
with
an
attitude
of
deferential
expectancy
winthrop
said
his
host
would
it
not
be
well
to
let
your
son
s
wife
meet
him
first
the
old
father
bowed
he
saw
at
once
the
wisdom
of
this
i
d
like
ye
to
stand
where
ye
could
get
a
glimpse
of
his
face
when
he
first
catches
sight
o
his
wife
it
will
be
a
better
proof
that
i
ve
told
ye
the
truth
than
all
the
words
i
ve
said
to
ye
whispered
william
i
have
never
doubted
your
word
william
said
the
father
sadly
with
much
shouting
and
blowing
of
the
trumpet
the
morning
train
lumbered
in
and
the
passengers
began
rapidly
to
emerge
there
were
loud
talk
and
tooting
of
the
horn
and
a
clatter
of
machinery
as
the
fireman
jumped
down
and
attended
to
some
detail
of
the
engine
s
mechanism
some
said
he
did
this
to
show
off
before
the
gaping
crowd
who
had
not
yet
grown
used
to
the
fact
that
a
machine
could
draw
a
number
of
loaded
carriages
through
the
country
without
the
aid
of
horses
the
two
old
gentlemen
had
rapidly
withdrawn
into
a
secluded
place
by
a
chapter
xi
one
of
the
first
to
get
out
of
the
carriages
was
harrington
winthrop
a
high
stock
held
his
chin
well
tilted
in
the
air
his
gray
trousers
were
immaculate
and
his
coat
fitted
about
his
slender
waist
as
trimly
as
any
lady
s
he
wore
a
high
gray
beaver
hat
and
carried
a
shiny
new
portmanteau
altogether
he
looked
quite
a
dandy
and
the
eyes
of
his
waiting
wife
filled
with
a
light
of
pride
even
while
her
heart
quaked
only
an
instant
she
paused
to
watch
him
he
was
making
straight
for
the
van
rensselaer
carriage
which
stood
not
far
away
and
which
he
supposed
had
been
sent
to
bring
him
to
the
house
he
walked
with
an
importance
and
pride
that
any
one
might
see
he
did
not
take
note
of
any
one
on
the
platform
though
he
was
conscious
that
many
were
watching
him
then
suddenly
the
woman
with
the
two
little
children
clinging
to
her
skirts
stepped
in
his
way
the
little
girl
looked
up
into
his
face
with
bold
blue
eyes
and
cried
out
it
s
my
pa
it
s
my
pa
oh
doesn
t
he
look
pretty
the
two
men
standing
close
together
under
the
were
near
enough
to
hear
the
child
s
cry
and
many
bystanders
turned
and
looked
at
the
fine
gentleman
beset
by
the
woman
and
children
harrington
winthrop
turned
his
elegant
self
about
with
a
start
and
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
worn
shadow
of
the
woman
who
for
a
time
had
been
his
plaything
and
whom
he
had
tossed
aside
as
easily
and
as
carelessly
as
if
she
had
been
a
doll
the
start
the
pallor
the
quick
furtive
all
told
their
tale
to
the
watchers
without
other
need
of
words
then
anger
surged
into
young
winthrop
s
face
and
he
cried
out
stand
back
you
vagabonds
what
have
i
to
do
with
you
get
out
of
my
way
woman
there
is
a
carriage
waiting
for
me
but
the
woman
stood
her
ground
with
grim
determination
great
red
waves
of
restrained
anger
marking
her
face
and
forehead
as
if
he
had
struck
her
with
his
words
she
looked
up
at
him
she
had
planned
it
all
for
so
many
hours
and
now
she
was
calm
in
this
terrible
crisis
it
would
not
do
to
make
a
public
disturbance
neither
for
his
sake
nor
for
her
own
did
she
wish
to
have
people
see
or
hear
if
it
could
be
avoided
so
she
had
schooled
herself
to
be
harrington
she
said
speaking
low
and
rapidly
i
m
your
wife
and
you
know
it
i
ve
come
to
keep
you
from
an
awful
sin
and
i
will
do
it
you
can
t
forgit
me
an
the
children
and
marry
a
rich
girl
it
would
be
wicked
but
i
ve
fixed
it
so
you
can
t
do
it
any
way
if
you
ll
come
off
quiet
with
me
now
i
won
t
say
a
word
to
disgrace
you
here
where
i
s
pose
folks
knows
you
but
if
you
try
to
git
away
from
me
i
ll
tell
the
whole
world
who
i
be
an
prove
it
too
now
if
the
young
man
had
known
that
there
were
those
watching
who
knew
his
story
he
would
have
been
more
careful
but
his
casual
glance
about
the
platform
had
given
him
no
hint
of
any
but
the
villagers
few
of
whom
he
knew
even
slightly
yet
his
wife
s
face
and
voice
were
such
that
he
thought
it
the
part
of
wisdom
to
temporize
so
he
dropped
his
angry
manner
and
spoke
in
a
low
tone
but
it
happened
that
the
two
witnesses
under
the
had
also
by
common
consent
moved
toward
him
with
william
mccord
in
their
rear
they
came
and
stood
quite
close
to
harrington
and
though
he
did
not
see
them
every
word
that
he
spoke
was
audible
look
here
alberta
what
in
the
name
of
common
sense
are
you
doing
up
here
isn
t
it
hard
enough
for
me
to
have
to
work
and
scrape
and
do
all
in
my
power
to
get
my
business
going
again
so
that
i
can
come
home
to
you
and
the
children
and
keep
you
in
the
way
you
ought
to
be
kept
without
having
you
come
traipsing
around
here
in
such
clothes
as
that
don
t
you
know
you
d
ruin
my
business
if
anybody
thought
you
belonged
to
me
everybody
thinks
i
m
a
successful
business
man
and
they
must
think
so
or
i
m
lost
and
shall
never
come
back
to
you
here
take
this
money
a
man
just
paid
me
a
bill
that
he
has
been
owing
me
for
two
years
and
i
needed
the
money
to
help
me
in
a
new
deal
but
as
you
are
here
you
ll
have
to
have
it
to
get
home
with
now
run
along
back
and
take
good
care
of
the
children
till
i
come
home
a
rich
man
then
we
ll
live
like
folks
and
what
is
all
this
nonsense
you
are
talking
about
my
marrying
a
rich
girl
how
ever
could
you
get
such
an
idea
why
i
couldn
t
marry
anybody
as
long
as
you
are
my
wife
you
must
have
heard
some
foolish
gossip
take
it
quick
and
run
along
or
people
will
be
looking
and
talking
and
i
shall
be
ruined
the
thin
hand
of
the
wife
went
out
to
the
money
he
offered
her
but
instead
of
taking
it
she
struck
it
into
the
air
and
it
fell
scattering
in
every
direction
suddenly
the
young
man
became
aware
of
the
nearness
of
others
and
looking
up
he
saw
in
quick
succession
his
father
van
rensselaer
and
william
mccord
he
knew
at
once
that
they
had
heard
every
word
he
had
spoken
to
his
wife
even
before
their
condemning
eyes
had
searched
his
soul
the
presence
of
william
mccord
made
it
plain
to
him
that
they
had
known
the
story
before
his
arrival
and
he
realized
instantly
that
he
had
given
the
final
testimony
against
himself
it
was
too
late
to
turn
back
and
deny
knowledge
of
the
woman
there
stood
his
father
s
former
farm
manager
who
had
lived
in
the
western
town
where
harrington
had
married
his
wife
that
mccord
would
ever
come
east
again
and
bring
back
tales
against
him
had
not
occurred
to
the
careless
young
scapegrace
mccord
was
a
quiet
silent
man
who
went
about
his
own
business
and
seldom
if
ever
wrote
letters
young
winthrop
had
never
given
an
uneasy
thought
to
him
but
now
he
stood
and
looked
at
him
in
growing
dismay
turning
harrington
met
his
father
s
passionate
loving
reproach
his
wife
s
bitter
hopelessness
and
the
scorn
of
the
man
he
had
hoped
soon
to
call
his
the
voice
of
winthrop
broke
out
in
bitterness
oh
my
son
my
son
and
the
father
s
kind
face
was
turned
away
he
was
weeping
this
kind
of
reproach
had
ever
angered
harrington
winthrop
beyond
all
endurance
it
seethed
over
his
frightened
fretted
spirit
now
like
acid
in
a
wound
the
voice
of
the
trainman
cried
out
all
aboard
the
trumpet
sounded
and
the
wheels
moved
the
fireman
jumped
on
board
then
harrington
winthrop
grasped
his
portmanteau
pushed
aside
his
frightened
children
who
were
eagerly
gathering
up
the
scattered
money
and
sprang
into
a
vacant
carriage
his
game
was
up
and
he
knew
it
with
a
wild
cry
the
wife
caught
up
her
little
boy
and
dragging
her
little
girl
rushed
after
him
a
couple
of
men
standing
by
pushed
her
up
into
the
carriage
with
her
husband
which
happened
to
be
occupied
by
no
one
else
before
he
had
time
to
turn
about
and
notice
what
had
happened
the
train
was
going
rapidly
on
its
way
and
the
reunited
family
had
ample
opportunity
to
discuss
their
situation
harrington
winthrop
had
completed
the
last
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
against
him
he
had
fled
van
rensselaer
stood
looking
after
the
vanishing
train
with
satisfaction
he
had
watched
the
changing
expressions
on
the
face
of
the
young
man
who
had
expected
to
become
the
husband
of
his
only
daughter
the
cruelty
the
craven
fear
the
hate
and
the
utter
selfishness
of
the
man
suppose
his
daughter
had
stood
where
that
poor
wife
had
stood
and
begged
of
him
to
come
home
to
her
and
care
for
her
what
an
escape
the
daughter
who
had
been
the
object
of
so
little
of
his
thought
or
care
had
suddenly
become
dear
to
him
mary
s
daughter
the
child
of
his
real
love
he
saw
how
utterly
selfish
and
unfatherly
had
been
his
whole
action
with
regard
to
her
how
almost
criminal
in
his
there
had
come
too
a
revelation
from
the
sight
of
that
poor
deserted
wife
a
revelation
of
what
his
treatment
of
his
own
wife
mary
had
been
he
was
stung
with
a
remorse
such
as
he
had
not
known
before
as
william
mccord
watched
the
departing
train
he
might
have
been
said
fairly
to
glow
with
contentment
over
the
way
things
had
come
out
not
that
he
felt
that
matters
would
be
materially
improved
for
the
poor
woman
who
was
making
her
last
frantic
effort
to
get
back
what
she
had
lost
but
he
was
justified
fully
justified
in
the
eyes
of
his
benefactor
he
could
now
with
a
clear
conscience
take
his
way
back
to
his
claim
in
western
mississippi
and
feel
that
he
had
done
his
duty
as
for
winthrop
he
was
filled
with
horror
his
son
s
face
had
been
a
revelation
to
him
until
now
it
had
been
impossible
for
him
to
conceive
that
harrington
had
done
this
wrong
underneath
all
his
conviction
of
the
truth
of
william
mccord
s
story
there
had
still
been
a
lingering
hope
that
in
some
way
the
beloved
son
would
explain
things
satisfactorily
winthrop
now
realized
that
he
had
never
really
known
his
boy
at
all
the
old
father
gazed
after
the
train
in
the
dim
distance
saw
it
round
a
curve
and
vanish
from
his
sight
then
turned
and
walked
with
bowed
head
away
from
them
all
he
felt
that
such
sorrow
was
too
heavy
for
him
chapter
xii
dawn
was
already
dressed
for
the
wedding
her
surveyed
her
with
a
kind
of
grim
pride
the
shimmering
satin
fitted
the
slim
girlish
form
to
perfection
and
the
yellow
lace
set
off
the
pink
and
cream
complexion
it
was
a
beautiful
frock
and
all
who
saw
it
would
be
sure
to
say
so
there
had
been
some
contention
about
the
arrangement
of
the
girl
s
hair
dawn
wanted
to
be
married
with
her
curls
down
her
back
as
she
had
always
worn
them
but
her
was
firm
that
could
not
be
if
her
hair
had
been
only
long
enough
to
reach
to
her
shoulders
it
would
not
have
seemed
so
absurd
for
many
young
women
wore
their
short
ringlets
all
about
the
neck
but
dawn
s
hair
fell
far
below
her
waist
in
rich
abundant
curls
it
was
out
of
the
question
for
her
to
be
married
looking
so
like
a
child
the
argument
had
waxed
hot
and
at
one
point
dawn
had
declared
that
she
would
not
be
married
at
all
unless
she
could
wear
her
hair
as
she
had
always
worn
it
finally
her
threatened
to
go
for
the
girl
s
father
to
settle
the
dispute
dawn
s
face
was
white
and
she
turned
away
to
hide
her
emotion
then
in
a
strange
hard
voice
she
said
i
will
put
it
up
if
it
must
be
after
all
what
did
that
or
anything
else
matter
certainly
not
enough
to
invoke
her
father
s
wrath
upon
her
at
this
most
trying
moment
of
her
life
she
drew
the
mass
of
beautiful
curls
up
on
her
head
fastening
them
with
a
large
comb
which
had
been
her
mother
s
and
was
treasured
by
the
young
girl
the
ends
of
the
curls
fell
in
a
little
shower
over
the
back
of
the
comb
making
a
lovely
effect
the
thought
it
far
too
careless
and
and
frowned
at
the
sweet
artistic
head
but
dawn
gave
it
a
pat
here
and
there
and
would
have
no
more
to
say
about
it
with
her
own
hands
she
arranged
the
filmy
veil
she
would
not
have
her
s
assistance

in
which
the
young
bride
draped
the
delicate
fabric
the
elder
woman
was
half
jealous
of
the
girl
s
deftness
put
on
your
gloves
and
you
ll
do
very
nicely
though
i
must
say
i
d
rather
see
your
hair
smooth
for
once
but
the
veil
hides
the
frowsiness
now
is
there
anything
you
d
like
to
know
about
what
you
ve
got
to
do
dawn
looked
at
her
in
horror
i
haven
t
got
to
do
anything
have
i
there
was
genuine
distress
in
her
voice
she
had
been
so
absorbed
in
the
great
thought
of
the
result
of
this
act
that
the
ceremony
itself
about
which
so
many
girls
worry
had
not
entered
into
her
mind
in
the
least
well
said
van
was
satisfaction
in
her
voice
for
dawn
was
unconsciously
making
it
easier
for
her
than
she
had
dared
to
there
isn
t
much
of
course
nothing
but
to
keep
your
eyes
down
and
walk
in
and
say
yes
it
s
all
very
simple
the
main
thing
is
never
to
look
up
it
is
counted
very
bad
manners
to
look
up
a
bride
who
raises
her
eyes
during
the
ceremony
or
before
is
called
very
bold
immodest
the
s
voice
sounded
queer
to
herself
and
she
picked
at
an
invisible
thread
on
her
sleeve
this
was
the
first
bald
lie
she
had
ever
told
in
her
life
though
she
had
made
many
a
misleading
statement
but
that
of
course
to
a
woman
with
a
conscience
was
a
very
different
thing
this
woman
thought
she
had
a
conscience
and
she
was
excusing
her
present
action
on
the
ground
of
necessity
and
the
circumstances
she
s
getting
a
far
better
husband
every
way
anyhow
and
it
isn
t
as
if
she
was
much
attached
to
the
other
man
one
can
see
she
was
afraid
of
him
i
m
really
doing
her
a
service
and
she
ll
thank
me
when
she
finds
it
out
this
was
what
she
told
her
conscience
now
and
went
on
with
her
advice
to
dawn
you
want
to
walk
downstairs
very
slowly
with
your
eyes
on
the
hem
of
your
frock
you
mustn
t
look
up
for
anything
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
what
i
should
want
to
look
up
for
said
dawn
coldly
i
d
much
rather
look
down
i
m
glad
it
s
quite
polite
to
do
so
that
s
right
commended
her
with
unusual
alacrity
and
it
won
t
do
a
bit
of
harm
to
keep
it
up
some
afterward
too
at
least
till
you
get
out
to
the
and
then
you
can
look
into
your
plate
a
good
deal
people
will
only
think
you
are
shy
and
modest
and
say
nice
things
about
you
for
it
i
don
t
care
what
people
think
observed
the
girl
is
that
all
oh
there
ll
be
things
he
ll
ask
minister
you
know
the
regular
service
he
ll
say
a
lot
of
things
and
then
ask
you
do
you
thus
promise
and
then
you
say
yes
or
you
can
just
nod
your
head
but
suppose
i
don
t
like
to
promise
those
things
won
t
he
marry
me
the
girl
asked
the
question
sharply
as
if
she
saw
a
possibility
of
escape
somewhere
but
the
older
woman
was
so
relieved
that
her
task
had
been
performed
that
she
took
little
notice
of
the
question
oh
yes
she
answered
carelessly
thinking
the
girl
was
anxious
about
saying
her
part
at
the
right
time
if
you
don
t
get
it
in
he
ll
go
right
on
any
way
and
it
ll
soon
be
over
you
know
doctor
parker
is
very
deaf
and
he
wouldn
t
know
whether
you
said
yes
or
no
now
if
there
isn
t
anything
else
i
ll
go
down
for
i
hear
more
carriages
coming
and
i
ll
be
needed
you
re
sure
you
don
t
want
to
see
before
the
ceremony
no
said
dawn
turning
away
from
her
with
a
quick
gasp
of
her
breath
oh
if
she
need
never
see
him
how
happy
she
would
be
well
then
i
ll
go
down
you
be
all
ready
when
i
call
you
to
come
now
mind
you
don
t
once
raise
your
eyes
until
the
ceremony
is
over
and
you
are
out
in
the
above
all
things
don
t
look
up
at
your
husband
even
then
nobody
should
see
you
look
at
each
other
it
makes
them
think
you
are
foolish
and
silly
i
shall
certainly
not
look
at
him
said
dawn
with
white
lips
then
the
went
out
of
the
room
dawn
fastened
the
door
and
went
quickly
over
to
the
stand
where
the
roses
had
been
unnoticed
by
van
rensselaer
had
she
seen
them
it
would
have
been
like
her
to
throw
them
out
of
the
window
lest
the
water
should
upset
on
the
white
satin
frock
the
girl
bent
over
and
breathed
in
their
fragrance
again
and
then
carefully
drying
the
stem
on
a
towel
she
slipped
them
up
under
her
veil
and
fastened
them
upon
her
breast
with
a
little
pearl
pin
that
had
belonged
to
her
mother
she
went
to
her
glass
and
viewed
the
effect
through
her
veil
with
a
white
wan
smile
at
the
buds
nestling
among
the
beautiful
lace
she
would
have
one
thing
as
she
wanted
it
any
way
if
she
must
be
married
she
would
wear
the
flowers
that
had
been
given
to
her
with
a
smile
by
somebody
that
understood
this
was
the
last
time
she
would
have
the
right
to
wear
another
man
s
flowers
after
she
would
belong
to
her
husband
but
until
she
did
she
would
wear
the
only
flowers
that
had
ever
meant
anything
to
her
then
she
closed
her
eyes
and
tried
to
get
her
spirit
calmed
but
she
felt
like
one
of
those
old
queens
in
a
tower
that
they
used
to
study
about
at
school
who
was
soon
to
go
out
and
have
her
head
cut
off
with
the
guillotine
a
few
minutes
later
winthrop
again
ascended
the
stairs
to
his
wife
s
room
they
want
you
to
come
down
janet
he
said
gently
martha
and
the
girls
have
come
and
they
are
all
waiting
for
you
i
shall
not
come
down
until
i
have
had
a
talk
with
my
son
harrington
said
that
lady
decidedly
are
you
not
coming
down
to
the
ceremony
asked
her
husband
it
went
very
hard
with
him
to
deceive
the
wife
of
his
youth
but
there
seemed
no
other
way
to
deal
with
her
in
the
present
situation
the
ceremony
she
arose
with
alacrity
what
do
you
mean
has
harrington
come
and
has
he
explained
everything
it
has
turned
out
just
as
i
supposed
it
would
she
stopped
in
front
of
the
glass
and
smoothed
her
hair
she
had
arrayed
herself
in
her
best
immediately
after
breakfast
i
should
think
it
was
time
an
apology
was
due
from
you
mr
winthrop
madam
winthrop
stood
haughtily
in
the
middle
of
the
room
aware
that
her
small
figure
was
elegant
and
feeling
that
she
had
entire
command
of
the
situation
there
was
a
becoming
triumph
in
the
brightness
of
her
eyes
and
the
set
of
her
cameo
lips
the
wedding
is
to
be
at
once
said
her
husband
gravely
motioning
her
to
precede
him
what
was
harrington
s
explanation
she
whispered
eager
as
any
girl
now
that
she
thought
she
had
come
off
triumphant
there
is
no
time
to
talk
about
it
now
said
her
husband
again
motioning
her
down
the
stairs
she
had
a
mind
to
make
another
stand
before
his
grave
authority
but
in
reality
she
was
too
much
relieved
from
the
awful
strain
she
had
been
under
during
the
past
hours
for
her
to
care
to
hold
out
against
him
longer
she
went
quietly
down
the
stairs
and
took
the
place
van
rensselaer
most
ungraciously
assigned
her
there
was
in
that
lady
s
eye
something
unquelled
which
gave
the
bridegroom
s
mother
some
uneasiness
and
took
her
mind
from
the
ceremony
so
that
she
failed
to
notice
as
the
little
procession
passed
by
her
almost
immediately
that
harrington
was
not
a
part
of
it
and
that
her
youngest
son
occupied
the
place
of
the
bridegroom
it
was
not
until
the
clear
voice
rang
out
in
the
words
i
do
that
something
in
the
boyish
accents
made
her
look
up
and
stretch
her
neck
to
see
her
son
how
strange
that
harrington
s
voice
should
sound
so
exactly
like
charles
s
but
some
one
was
standing
so
that
the
bridegroom
s
face
could
not
be
seen
by
her
the
little
bride
with
downcast
eyes
and
palpitating
heart
stood
demurely
by
his
side
her
cold
hands
trembling
within
the
gloves
her
had
brought
from
new
york
for
the
occasion
one
lay
upon
a
fine
black
that
had
put
itself
within
reaching
distance
she
had
not
put
the
glove
there
herself
a
hand
a
strong
warm
hand
had
taken
it
and
put
it
there
a
hand
that
against
her
will
had
sent
a
strange
thrill
through
her
and
left
her
faint
and
frightened
that
had
been
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
she
had
walked
with
it
thus
down
the
room
she
had
not
looked
up
to
see
to
whom
that
sleeve
belonged
she
believed
she
knew
and
it
sent
no
pleasant
thought
to
her
heart
yet
she
had
to
acknowledge
that
the
arm
had
steadied
her
and
kept
her
from
stumbling
and
had
guided
her
safely
into
the
vacant
spot
in
front
of
the
minister
dawn
did
not
look
beyond
the
hem
of
her
garments
but
kept
her
long
lashes
drooping
on
her
crimson
cheeks
a
lovely
but
frightened
bride
she
felt
keenly
the
moment
the
service
began
and
knew
that
she
was
surrendering
forever
her
liberty
and
girlhood
to
everything
that
she
had
ever
counted
happy
in
this
life
no
house
no
pretty
dishes
no
handsome
furniture
could
ever
make
up
for
that
now
and
her
heart
cried
out
in
anguish
that
she
had
not
vetoed
the
idea
when
it
was
first
proposed
to
her
before
it
had
gone
so
far
that
retraction
was
dishonorable
when
the
vows
were
read
and
she
heard
their
terrible
binding
import
she
longed
to
cry
out
her
horror
in
a
great
echoing
that
should
leave
no
doubt
in
any
mind
and
would
even
penetrate
to
the
good
minister
s
deaf
ears
but
her
tongue
was
tied
by
fear
of
her
father
and
his
friends
and
she
dared
not
lift
her
voice
yet
she
would
not
speak
to
make
promises
her
heart
could
not
echo
and
so
she
stood
silent
with
no
nod
of
her
head
no
breath
of
a
yes
the
minister
after
waiting
an
instant
for
the
desired
assent
passed
monotonously
and
solemnly
on
to
the
end
and
pronounced
those
two
who
knew
each
of
the
other
as
little
almost
as
it
was
possible
for
two
human
beings
to
know
man
and
wife
during
the
prayer
that
followed
dawn
had
hard
work
to
keep
back
the
tears
that
were
struggling
to
creep
out
and
cool
her
flushed
cheeks
but
the
breath
of
the
roses
at
her
breast
seemed
to
steal
up
and
comfort
her
and
once
just
before
the
end
a
strong
hand
warm
and
gentle
was
placed
over
her
gloved
one
for
just
an
instant
with
a
pressure
that
seemed
to
promise
help
yet
because
she
thought
it
was
an
unloved
hand
it
only
made
her
heart
beat
the
more
wildly
and
she
was
glad
when
the
prayer
was
ended
and
the
hand
was
taken
away
they
came
crowding
about
her
after
it
was
over
in
the
order
of
their
rank
stiffly
at
first
and
with
great
formality
the
bride
still
kept
her
eyes
drooped
barely
glancing
up
at
those
who
took
her
hand
or
kissed
her
and
never
once
lifting
her
eyes
to
the
man
who
stood
by
her
side
it
was
the
first
and
only
mandate
of
her
s
that
she
obeyed
to
the
letter
and
to
the
end
van
rensselaer
gave
her
a
cold
kiss
and
whispered
that
she
was
doing
very
well
and
her
father
gave
her
the
second
kiss
she
could
remember
from
him
since
he
had
sent
her
own
mother
away
and
said
in
a
low
tone
poor
child
i
hope
you
will
be
happy
now
she
puzzled
over
that
sentence
long
why
had
he
called
her
poor
child
and
yet
seemed
so
sure
by
his
tone
that
she
had
attained
a
height
upon
which
happiness
was
assured
it
touched
her
more
than
anything
else
that
he
had
ever
said
to
her
winthrop
bowed
low
over
dawn
s
hand
and
told
her
he
was
glad
to
have
another
dear
daughter
and
madam
winthrop
coming
up
from
the
side
away
from
the
bridegroom
graciously
kissed
her
and
called
her
a
sweet
child
then
she
turned
to
meet
her
son
and
stopped
aghast
saying
charles
where
is
harrington
now
dawn
might
have
heard
the
disturbance
and
been
much
enlightened
and
all
van
rensselaer
s
fine
plans
might
have
been
exposed
if
it
had
not
been
that
madeleine
and
cordelia
stepped
up
to
their
new
close
behind
their
mother
while
betty
had
rushed
in
and
smothered
her
with
kisses
whispering
oh
you
darling
sister
how
i
am
going
to
enjoy
you
the
three
girls
stood
gushing
and
fluttering
over
the
young
bride
so
that
she
did
not
hear
what
went
on
for
as
it
happened
charles
bent
low
over
his
mother
so
that
the
stream
of
relatives
should
not
hear
and
said
in
a
quiet
voice
mother
dear
congratulate
me
instead
of
harrington
it
is
i
who
have
been
married
harrington
has
just
gone
away
on
the
train
with
his
wife
and
children
don
t
feel
sorry
little
mother
you
would
not
let
us
tell
you
be
careful
mother
people
are
looking
watching
you
mother
but
madam
winthrop
said
not
a
word
instead
her
pretty
cameo
face
went
white
as
death
and
she
slipped
quietly
down
at
the
feet
of
her
husband
and
son
in
a
blessed
unconsciousness
for
the
sake
of
herself
and
all
concerned
it
was
the
best
thing
she
could
have
done
what
might
have
happened
had
she
kept
her
senses
it
is
not
pleasant
to
contemplate
for
she
was
a
person
of
strong
will
and
a
fiery
temper
although
cultured
and
beloved
beyond
most
women
of
her
day
they
said
that
the
room
was
close
and
she
had
fainted
they
made
way
for
her
and
brought
fans
and
ice
water
but
her
husband
and
her
son
quietly
carried
her
from
the
room
and
when
betty
suddenly
realized
that
something
was
going
on
and
turned
around
they
told
her
that
her
mother
had
fainted
angular
old
maid
with
a
sarcastic
twirl
to
her
mouth
and
an
unpleasant
way
of
always
saying
the
wrong
thing
at
the
right
dawn
she
hoped
it
wasn
t
a
bad
omen
that
her
husband
had
had
to
leave
her
side
just
when
the
ceremony
was
over
this
was
the
first
intimation
that
the
young
bride
had
had
that
her
husband
was
gone
she
cast
a
sidewise
glance
and
discovered
that
there
were
ladies
all
around
her
she
raised
her
eyes
again
just
a
little
higher
and
swept
a
wider
circle
and
finally
cast
a
guarded
glance
about
the
entire
room
but
could
not
see
the
dreaded
face
then
she
drew
a
sigh
of
relief
at
this
small
respite
she
heard
some
one
say
that
he
had
gone
to
help
his
father
take
his
mother
upstairs
dawn
had
a
wild
impulse
to
fly
away
where
he
could
not
find
her
when
he
returned
but
knew
she
could
not
she
would
gladly
have
gone
upstairs
to
wait
on
the
sick
mother
if
only
he
were
not
there
also
people
kept
coming
around
to
congratulate
her
and
saying
how
sad
it
was
that
madam
winthrop
s
strength
had
given
way
at
just
that
moment
betty
stayed
close
by
and
dawn
dared
to
look
at
the
other
girl
s
sweet
dimpled
face
all
pink
and
white
with
heavenly
blue
eyes
and
golden
hair
they
reminded
the
bride
of
him
whom
she
had
seen
in
the
garden
that
morning
it
was
a
pleasant
thought
and
dawn
continued
to
watch
betty
when
she
was
sure
her
was
not
looking
at
her
by
and
by
van
rensselaer
passed
behind
her
and
whispered
they
are
coming
downstairs
now
winthrop
is
better
we
will
go
out
to
the
and
you
must
cut
the
wedding
cake
you
know
you
are
doing
very
well
only
remember
what
i
said
not
to
look
around
too
much
a
shy
bride
is
the
very
best
kind
of
bride
a
cold
trembling
came
over
the
young
wife
he
was
coming
back
and
a
chill
seemed
to
have
crept
into
the
sunny
day
she
hastily
dropped
her
eyes
with
the
strange
determination
not
to
look
upon
her
husband
until
absolutely
compelled
to
do
so
there
seemed
somehow
a
fascination
to
her
in
keeping
this
up
as
long
as
possible
when
charles
came
down
and
hastened
to
her
side
she
was
talking
earnestly
with
his
aunt
martha
who
was
telling
a
pretty
little
incident
of
charles
s
babyhood
dawn
had
not
the
faintest
conception
of
who
charles
was
but
she
nodded
and
smiled
and
aunt
martha
thought
her
a
sweet
child
and
took
her
immediately
into
her
gentle
heart
she
was
somewhat
aghast
at
the
manner
in
which
events
had
marched
into
the
family
history
that
day
but
she
thought
it
not
polite
to
mention
it
to
dawn
a
distant
relative
of
van
rensselaer
came
up
just
then
and
murmured
in
a
disagreeable
whisper
your
husband
is
a
sight
younger
than
i
expected
jemima
i
had
been
led
to
expect
he
was
quite
a
settled
man
a
good
ten
or
fifteen
years
older
n
you
but
he
s
real
handsome
you
mustn
t
get
proud
child
dawn
started
back
as
if
she
had
been
stung
and
became
aware
at
once
of
a
figure
standing
close
by
her
side
she
was
grateful
to
the
people
who
kept
talking
to
her
and
to
him
so
that
there
would
be
no
chance
of
his
speaking
to
her
or
of
her
having
to
answer
him
now
she
felt
it
would
be
more
than
she
could
do
and
look
at
him
now
she
would
not
not
till
she
absolutely
must
it
would
unnerve
her
to
look
him
in
the
face
and
know
that
she
was
his
wife
and
that
he
had
a
right
over
her
from
henceforth
then
all
at
once
she
heard
his
voice
and
it
was
not
harrington
s
at
all
a
quick
glance
assured
her
it
was
her
friend
of
the
roses
perhaps
then
harrington
was
still
upstairs
with
his
mother
she
drew
a
breath
of
relief
a
few
mouthfuls
of
the
wedding
breakfast
she
managed
to
swallow
and
she
pushed
a
knife
through
the
great
black
with
spice
and
all
things
good
which
had
been
made
when
van
rensselaer
first
heard
of
the
possibility
of
this
marriage
and
kept
in
ripening
ever
since
dawn
s
was
a
fine
housekeeper
and
knew
how
to
be
ready
for
emergencies
it
was
over
at
last
and
van
rensselaer
came
to
say
that
it
was
time
for
her
to
go
upstairs
and
change
her
frock
for
the
journey
dawn
had
never
before
followed
her
with
so
much
willingness
as
now
her
feet
fairly
kissed
the
oaken
stairs
as
she
mounted
but
she
had
gone
up
only
three
steps
when
some
one
came
quickly
up
and
standing
by
the
stairs
touched
her
on
the
shoulder
saying
in
a
voice
that
sent
a
thrill
of
joy
through
her
we
re
to
go
in
the
train
did
you
know
it
forgetting
her
vows
and
her
s
warnings
she
looked
down
and
saw
that
it
was
the
young
man
of
the
garden
again
her
face
lit
with
a
beautiful
smile
and
some
people
down
in
the
hall
who
were
watching
them
said
one
to
another
see
how
much
they
love
each
other
the
dear
children
and
turned
away
with
a
regretful
smile
and
a
sigh
toward
their
own
lost
youth
oh
breathed
dawn
i
did
not
know
it
but
i
m
so
glad
you
are
going
too
in
saying
this
she
had
no
thought
of
disloyalty
to
the
man
she
thought
she
had
married
it
was
merely
the
involuntary
expression
of
her
frightened
heart
that
suddenly
saw
a
rift
in
the
dark
cloud
oh
so
am
i
he
smiled
and
i
m
glad
you
wore
my
roses
next
your
heart
put
them
on
again
when
you
come
down
won
t
you
i
will
she
promised
and
let
her
eyes
dwell
on
him
for
an
instant
then
fled
up
the
stairs
as
her
called
in
a
voice
intended
to
be
a
whisper
jemima
do
for
pity
s
sake
hurry
you
will
be
late
for
the
train
and
then
there
ll
be
a
great
van
rensselaer
was
in
hot
water
lest
the
girl
should
learn
the
true
state
of
affairs
before
she
got
away
from
the
house
it
had
given
the
no
small
fright
to
see
charles
talking
with
the
girl
over
the
railing
she
looked
at
dawn
keenly
but
there
actually
was
some
look
of
interest
in
the
girl
s
eyes
van
rensselaer
drew
a
sigh
of
relief
as
she
hurried
about
to
help
the
young
wife
with
dressing
chapter
xiii
there
were
no
pleasant
memories
about
the
room
dawn
occupied
for
her
to
look
about
upon
for
the
last
time
and
bid
long
ago
van
rensselaer
had
cleared
away
every
trace
of
her
predecessor
by
remodelling
all
the
rooms
and
taking
for
her
own
the
large
sunny
one
which
had
been
occupied
by
the
child
if
there
had
been
memories
left
after
the
overhauling
they
would
have
been
made
hateful
by
the
new
occupant
dawn
had
been
away
from
home
so
long
that
during
this
brief
stay
she
had
been
given
a
and
now
she
turned
from
it
without
a
glance
if
anything
to
get
away
from
the
place
that
had
witnessed
her
deepest
grief
she
would
have
liked
to
run
down
into
the
old
garden
and
get
one
more
glimpse
of
her
woods
the
ravine
the
old
mill
and
the
dam
with
the
babbling
brook
in
the
distance
but
that
of
course
would
be
thought
unpardonable
so
she
walked
quietly
downstairs
turning
over
in
her
mind
the
comfort
it
was
that
during
the
journey
she
was
not
to
be
entirely
alone
with
the
man
she
had
married
she
did
not
know
where
she
was
going
she
had
not
cared
to
inquire
which
of
several
houses
he
had
told
her
about
had
finally
been
purchased
she
was
going
with
him
as
any
thoughtless
child
might
have
gone
if
only
the
had
let
what
conscience
she
had
guide
her
and
had
told
the
girl
the
truth
many
things
might
have
been
different
if
allowed
to
hear
the
earnest
profession
of
love
from
charles
winthrop
s
lips
dawn
would
undoubtedly
have
gone
to
him
gladly
out
of
the
shadow
of
horror
that
seemed
about
to
engulf
her
a
sweet
memory
of
her
wedding
morning
would
have
been
saved
to
her
and
she
would
have
been
spared
much
pain
the
might
have
kept
her
contented
conscience
too
to
the
end
of
her
days
and
not
been
tormented
with
the
thought
that
she
had
veered
from
the
righteous
path
but
dawn
did
not
know
and
went
down
the
stairs
with
a
heavy
heart
looking
for
only
a
brief
alleviation
of
her
trouble
she
determined
that
she
would
not
look
at
her
husband
if
possible
until
this
stranger
was
gone
the
little
bustle
of
departure
was
over
at
last
they
put
her
into
the
carriage
and
still
harrington
winthrop
had
not
appeared
she
began
to
feel
her
heart
beating
wildly
at
the
thought
that
he
would
soon
be
coming
to
sit
beside
her
some
one
standing
on
the
piazza
asked
where
winthrop
had
gone
and
some
one
else
said
that
his
mother
had
sent
for
him
that
she
was
conscious
again
and
had
wished
to
see
him
before
he
left
dawn
thought
they
were
speaking
of
harrington
she
wished
his
mother
would
keep
him
a
long
time
and
then
it
occurred
to
her
that
the
train
would
go
and
the
young
man
with
it
probably
and
she
would
be
left
after
all
to
take
the
journey
alone
with
her
husband
of
course
it
would
have
to
be
alone
with
him
sooner
or
later
for
the
rest
of
her
life
but
oh
how
she
dreaded
it
then
to
her
inexpressible
relief
charles
came
rushing
down
the
stairs
and
some
one
called
out
a
question
about
his
father
is
not
winthrop
going
to
be
able
to
get
away
just
to
the
station
dawn
again
thought
they
were
speaking
of
harrington
yes
said
charles
he
will
be
down
in
a
moment
he
told
me
to
drive
on
and
he
would
come
in
our
carriage
which
is
here
you
know
with
that
he
jumped
into
the
seat
beside
dawn
the
servant
fastened
the
carriage
door
and
the
horses
started
on
their
way
down
the
curving
carriage
drive
and
out
through
the
great
gate
with
its
two
white
balls
on
the
tops
of
the
white
pillars
dawn
could
scarcely
believe
it
true
that
she
was
going
to
the
station
without
harrington
his
mother
must
be
very
ill
indeed
poor
lady
was
it
wrong
to
be
glad
she
wondered
because
it
gave
her
another
reprieve
brief
though
it
might
be
she
had
tucked
the
spray
of
roses
into
the
bosom
of
her
travelling
dark
green
silk
plaided
with
bars
of
black
and
a
little
black
silk
mantilla
which
made
her
feel
quite
and
which
van
rensselaer
had
been
assured
by
the
new
york
merchants
was
the
very
latest
thing
for
brides
a
great
wide
of
white
chip
trimmed
with
dark
green
ribbons
and
a
modest
plume
to
match
framed
her
sweet
face
and
helped
to
hide
its
shyness
as
she
sat
tremblingly
happy
at
her
escape
her
hands
in
pretty
gray
kid
gloves
lay
meekly
folded
in
her
lap
nothing
about
her
demure
manner
told
of
the
tumult
of
emotions
in
her
heart
beside
her
sat
a
knew
that
by
the
light
in
his
eyes
before
her
was
a
brief
ride
to
the
inn
where
the
train
stopped
it
would
last
but
a
few
minutes
and
during
that
time
she
would
like
to
say
something
to
have
him
say
something
anything
just
to
feel
the
pleasant
comradeship
which
she
had
seen
in
his
eyes
that
she
might
remember
him
always
her
one
friend
but
her
tongue
was
tied
and
her
eyes
could
not
raise
themselves
to
look
upon
his
face
any
more
than
if
he
had
been
the
dreaded
husband
charles
was
kept
busy
for
a
minute
or
two
bowing
to
the
guests
who
had
lined
themselves
up
along
the
driveway
to
see
the
couple
depart
dawn
glanced
shyly
at
them
from
her
lowered
lids
and
smiled
now
and
then
as
she
recognized
a
relative
or
the
kindly
face
of
an
old
servant
then
the
carriage
passed
out
into
the
street
while
her
companion
sat
back
very
close
to
her
as
if
she
needed
him
and
reaching
over
took
one
of
her
little
cold
hands
in
his
strong
warm
one
it
brought
comfort
and
a
thrill
of
joy
dawn
did
not
stop
to
question
if
he
had
a
right
or
if
she
were
doing
wrong
to
allow
such
familiarity
in
a
stranger
with
her
a
married
woman
and
belonging
to
another
man
such
questions
had
not
been
brought
up
for
her
consideration
though
she
had
a
few
fixed
little
principles
of
her
own
sweet
and
fine
and
natural
but
now
she
thought
only
on
her
great
need
and
how
this
strong
hand
met
it
she
longed
to
turn
and
fling
her
tired
head
upon
his
big
high
shoulder
and
weep
out
her
sorrow
she
did
not
do
so
of
course
but
sat
quietly
with
her
hand
enfolded
in
his
for
a
moment
and
dared
to
lift
her
sweet
eyes
to
his
then
without
any
warning
the
tears
which
had
been
repressed
so
long
she
had
forgotten
any
danger
from
them
sprang
into
her
eyes
he
thought
her
heart
was
tender
with
memories
of
the
home
she
was
leaving
and
perhaps
he
thought
jealously
she
was
sighing
for
her
false
fiancé
but
with
a
lover
s
true
impulse
and
in
spite
of
the
village
street
through
which
they
were
it
happily
chanced
that
this
was
a
quiet
bent
and
kissed
her
an
old
lady
out
among
her
flowers
in
the
front
yard
saw
them
and
nodded
to
herself
bless
their
dear
hearts
may
they
always
be
so
happy
and
brushed
away
a
tear
as
she
thought
of
a
grave
upon
a
hillside
and
a
day
far
agone
when
her
own
hopes
were
put
beneath
the
ground
it
was
a
very
short
drive
almost
immediately
after
they
had
passed
the
old
lady
s
house
they
turned
a
corner
which
brought
them
into
the
liveliest
part
of
the
town
where
people
were
stretching
their
necks
to
watch
them
and
all
was
stir
and
bustle
only
a
few
rods
away
stood
the
inn
with
the
railroad
tracks
gleaming
in
the
distance
people
were
already
gathering
to
watch
for
the
incoming
train
and
some
few
to
go
a
journey
though
there
were
not
so
many
travellers
in
those
days
with
his
kiss
upon
her
lips
and
a
tumult
of
strange
joy
in
her
heart
dawn
was
handed
from
the
carriage
to
the
platform
then
her
heart
stood
still
with
fear
again
as
she
remembered
who
was
to
come
in
the
other
carriage
soon
after
them
a
part
of
the
company
had
started
on
foot
for
the
station
among
them
betty
winthrop
and
they
now
came
trooping
up
around
the
bride
and
groom
with
laughing
talk
of
slippers
and
rice
which
they
had
reserved
for
the
novelty
of
throwing
at
a
train
instead
of
a
carriage
dawn
was
surrounded
and
taken
possession
of
she
had
no
further
opportunity
to
wonder
or
to
think
or
to
fear
but
over
her
there
hovered
a
sense
of
calamity
for
with
that
kiss
had
come
a
consciousness
that
she
was
not
being
loyal
to
her
own
ideals
of
what
a
wife
should
be
and
it
troubled
her
more
than
had
all
her
fears
nevertheless
it
had
been
sweet
and
she
kept
trying
to
cast
it
aside
with
the
thought
that
it
was
over
forever
now
and
she
would
have
no
further
cause
to
err
in
this
way
again
perhaps
the
kiss
was
sent
to
comfort
her
on
the
dreary
way
she
had
yet
to
go
the
other
carriage
drove
up
at
last
it
had
been
a
long
time
coming
for
madam
winthrop
had
returned
to
consciousness
only
to
fall
from
one
fit
of
weeping
into
another
and
then
to
blame
the
unfortunate
girl
whom
she
called
that
little
scheming
hussy
declaring
that
she
wasn
t
satisfied
with
leading
astray
a
man
of
integrity
like
harrington
but
when
she
found
it
was
impossible
to
make
him
swerve
from
his
duty
she
had
worked
upon
charles
s
tender
heart
and
made
him
marry
her
out
of
pity
she
was
scarcely
to
blame
poor
lady
for
her
nerves
had
been
on
a
continual
strain
for
many
hours
and
when
one
took
into
account
her
extraordinary
love
for
the
son
who
had
left
her
when
but
a
boy
and
whose
faults
she
had
entirely
overlooked
it
was
not
strange
but
it
was
hard
on
her
son
charles
and
on
her
devoted
husband
whose
love
for
her
was
deep
yet
whose
desire
to
make
everybody
else
happy
and
comfortable
was
also
great
it
had
been
a
trial
to
him
indeed
that
she
should
behave
in
this
unseemly
way
in
the
house
of
his
friend
he
had
found
it
useless
to
talk
with
her
or
to
try
to
pacify
her
so
at
last
he
left
her
with
his
sister
until
she
should
grow
calm
and
hastened
in
the
carriage
to
see
the
bridal
couple
off
it
had
been
arranged
that
charles
should
bring
his
young
wife
home
for
the
present
until
further
arrangements
for
their
new
life
could
be
made
dawn
s
heart
bounded
with
excitement
when
she
saw
that
no
one
was
sitting
in
the
carriage
but
the
elder
winthrop
she
did
not
know
whether
to
be
glad
or
sorry
if
he
did
not
come
in
time
for
the
train
perhaps
her
new
friend
would
go
on
without
them
and
yet
after
what
had
happened
perhaps
it
was
right
that
he
should
but
her
heart
sank
at
the
thought
and
involuntarily
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
drink
in
the
strong
handsome
outlines
of
his
face
charles
winthrop
turned
instantly
and
met
the
gaze
of
his
wife
with
a
look
of
such
deep
love
reverence
and
tender
care
that
it
sent
the
color
rushing
to
her
cheeks
and
the
blood
bounding
through
her
heart
it
seemed
almost
as
if
she
were
again
on
the
point
of
tears
so
many
emotions
had
followed
one
another
through
her
weary
soul
that
morning
but
just
then
there
came
a
distant
rumble
and
they
said
the
train
was
coming
everybody
rushed
at
dawn
at
once
and
kissed
her
betty
fairly
smothered
her
saying
oh
you
dear
dear
dear
i
shall
have
you
at
home
then
they
hurried
her
to
a
seat
in
the
railway
carriage
and
charles
sat
down
beside
her
nobody
seemed
to
think
it
strange
that
he
had
done
so
and
nobody
said
it
was
too
bad
her
husband
was
detained
they
did
not
even
seem
to
be
looking
for
him
and
wondering
why
he
was
not
there
dawn
was
bewildered
and
fairly
held
her
breath
wondering
if
it
could
be
possible
that
she
was
to
start
off
on
her
wedding
journey
without
the
bridegroom
though
she
had
not
been
to
many
weddings
she
knew
enough
to
feel
that
her
situation
was
a
strange
one
the
only
explanation
she
could
think
of
was
that
his
mother
had
been
so
ill
that
he
had
to
remain
with
her
for
a
time
and
would
come
later
and
explain
but
even
then
it
made
her
heart
sink
to
think
that
he
should
have
cared
so
little
for
her
embarrassment
that
he
had
sent
her
no
word
it
augured
ill
for
the
future
nevertheless
she
was
conscious
of
a
great
relief
that
he
had
not
come
and
a
great
comfort
in
the
presence
of
this
other
man
there
was
a
good
deal
of
fun
and
confusion
when
at
last
the
train
started
with
a
showering
of
rice
and
old
slippers
and
a
stretching
of
necks
from
the
other
carriages
to
see
what
it
was
all
about
but
they
were
soon
under
way
and
dawn
sat
back
with
intense
delight
to
enjoy
the
new
sensation
of
a
railway
ride
without
the
expected
attendant
inconvenience
of
an
unloved
husband
it
was
perhaps
not
ideal
but
she
could
not
help
it
and
when
one
s
heart
has
been
breaking
slowly
for
weeks
and
rapidly
for
the
last
few
hours
it
is
but
nature
to
let
it
throb
on
naturally
for
a
few
minutes
if
it
will
how
could
she
help
being
happy
the
sky
was
blue
blue
the
bits
of
water
they
glimpsed
far
away
the
winding
ribbon
of
the
river
in
the
distance
were
blue
also
the
trees
seemed
fairly
to
spread
themselves
in
the
summer
sunshine
and
the
whole
world
looked
washed
anew
for
happiness
basking
in
the
sunlight
of
heaven
the
birds
that
flew
away
at
sound
of
the
strange
creature
that
went
rumbling
through
the
country
the
sleepy
cows
that
grazed
diligently
upon
the
hillsides
the
dull
sheep
that
raised
unwondering
eyes
and
bleating
voice
at
the
moving
monster
all
seemed
new
creations
to
the
girl
she
cried
out
with
delight
at
everything
and
charles
entered
into
her
joy
it
was
not
charles
s
first
ride
upon
a
train
therefore
when
she
asked
some
question
about
their
wonderful
mode
of
travel
he
fell
to
explaining
it
all
carefully
to
her
with
a
learned
manner
that
fascinated
her
and
before
she
knew
it
she
was
watching
his
face
and
his
eyes
and
her
heart
was
glowing
with
the
thought
of
him
then
he
suddenly
caught
her
hand
that
lay
in
her
lap
and
taking
its
forefinger
between
his
own
thumb
and
finger
her
hand
enclosed
in
his
he
made
it
point
to
a
tiny
white
house
nestled
upon
a
hillside
far
away
with
a
glimpse
of
water
in
the
distance
and
a
shelter
of
feathery
trees
all
about
there
see
there
he
cried
do
you
see
that
house
up
there
how
would
you
like
it
if
you
and
i
lived
there
instantly
that
little
house
seemed
to
dawn
a
very
heaven
of
peace
to
which
she
would
gladly
fly
from
the
grander
house
that
she
thought
awaited
her
at
the
end
of
her
journey
she
caught
her
breath
and
pressed
her
free
hand
hard
upon
her
frightened
happy
heart
and
cried
oh
oh
so
wistfully
that
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
once
and
then
again
and
whispered
darling
my
darling
they
were
alone
in
their
carriage
you
remember
and
as
the
train
was
not
then
going
round
a
curve
but
was
sleepily
jogging
through
a
lovely
wooded
place
no
one
in
any
of
the
other
carriages
could
see
dawn
felt
the
thrill
of
his
touch
go
through
her
again
and
then
her
conscience
roused
and
she
drew
herself
away
quite
shyly
and
not
at
all
as
if
she
were
angry
her
cheeks
were
crimson
under
her
drooping
lashes
her
lover
watched
her
adoringly
he
was
shy
himself
and
felt
that
maybe
he
had
gone
too
far
in
a
public
place
like
a
railway
carriage
but
she
had
been
so
charming
and
was
she
not
his
then
her
trembling
lips
brought
out
a
question
which
shot
a
pang
of
jealous
pain
through
his
heart
won
t
you
tell
she
hesitated
painfully
wishing
he
would
understand
and
finish
the
sentence
for
her
but
he
only
looked
down
anxiously
trying
to
understand
what
she
wanted
won
t
you
please
tell
me
winthrop
is
he
understood
at
once
that
she
did
not
mean
his
father
but
his
scoundrel
brother
his
face
shadowed
with
a
frown
was
she
then
thinking
only
of
him
who
had
tried
to
cover
her
with
shame
and
disgrace
and
would
it
always
be
so
that
she
would
hark
away
from
his
love
to
that
which
had
gone
before
he
sighed
impatiently
but
tried
to
answer
her
gently
a
strange
pity
in
his
voice
i
thought
they
had
told
you
it
was
strange
they
did
not
he
took
the
train
at
once
he
found
it
was
necessary
you
understand
oh
there
was
immense
relief
in
dawn
s
exclamation
and
the
color
came
back
to
her
cheeks
which
had
grown
pale
with
apprehension
when
she
asked
the
question
then
he
will
not
come
on
this
train
at
all
she
asked
and
a
light
broke
into
her
eyes
you
poor
child
said
he
gently
were
you
afraid
of
that
he
laid
his
hand
over
hers
comfortingly
i
have
been
so
tired
and
so
frightened
murmured
dawn
and
now
she
had
to
let
the
tears
come
rolling
down
her
cheeks
though
she
tried
hard
enough
to
keep
them
back
but
somehow
she
felt
he
would
understand
it
all
and
she
lay
back
and
let
him
wipe
them
away
with
his
large
cool
handkerchief
that
smelled
of
and
between
the
tears
he
laid
a
kiss
now
and
then
that
seemed
like
healing
ointment
to
her
sore
heart
so
she
no
more
tried
to
contend
with
her
conscience
as
to
what
was
right
for
married
women
to
do
in
such
circumstances
she
only
knew
she
had
found
some
one
who
acted
toward
her
as
she
remembered
her
dear
mother
doing
the
kisses
seemed
such
as
an
angel
s
might
be
if
an
angel
stooped
to
kiss
so
she
ceased
trying
to
understand
and
just
took
the
comfort
of
it
perhaps
it
had
been
sent
to
her
to
help
her
in
her
time
of
need
remember
she
was
very
young
and
had
been
facing
a
great
terror
they
presently
trundled
out
of
the
woods
into
a
little
village
and
the
comforting
had
to
cease
dawn
sat
up
with
rosy
cheeks
and
bright
eyes
the
tears
all
gone
and
looked
about
her
with
interest
they
talked
in
low
tones
of
the
people
they
saw
come
and
go
on
the
platform
and
laughed
at
a
couple
of
geese
who
were
squawking
and
gabbling
at
the
train
for
coming
so
close
to
their
nice
by
the
track
putting
in
a
natural
protest
against
the
march
of
civilization
but
an
old
lady
with
many
bandboxes
and
a
was
put
into
their
coach
just
before
the
train
started
on
its
way
again
and
there
could
be
no
more
quiet
confidences
dawn
had
thought
she
would
presently
ask
a
few
more
questions
about
her
husband
and
why
he
had
found
it
necessary
to
take
another
train
most
of
all
she
wanted
to
know
when
and
where
she
was
to
meet
him
but
now
there
was
no
more
opportunity
to
ask
questions
at
albany
they
waited
for
the
and
walked
about
exploring
the
city
more
absorbed
in
their
own
pleasant
converse
than
in
however
do
you
know
they
have
never
told
me
your
name
i
heard
it
first
in
the
ceremony
this
morning
said
charles
with
a
smile
it
is
strange
isn
t
it
but
we
have
had
so
little
time
and
before
that
i
was
away
and
they
always
wrote
of
you
as
miss
van
i
never
asked
your
name
because
i
liked
to
think
of
you
as
i
saw
you
first
all
spring
blossoms
like
some
spirit
of
the
air
and
i
thought
a
name
might
destroy
the
vision
the
pink
came
softly
into
the
girl
s
cheek
at
his
earnest
words
and
it
filled
her
heart
with
a
glow
of
pleasure
like
to
nothing
she
had
ever
felt
before
they
wouldn
t
have
told
you
my
real
name
if
you
had
asked
said
she
showing
her
dimples
in
a
smile
answering
to
his
i
was
christened
jemima
but
my
mother
my
own
dear
mother
who
died
a
good
many
years
ago
told
me
my
name
was
dawn
and
she
always
called
me
that
she
wouldn
t
consent
to
my
being
named
jemima
until
she
found
out
that
the
meaning
of
it
was
dawn
of
the
morning
and
she
always
called
me
that
i
always
made
everybody
at
school
call
me
so
too
they
did
not
know
the
other
name
at
school
i
love
the
name
because
my
mother
loved
it
and
said
it
meant
something
sweet
and
dear
to
her
she
looked
up
and
the
eyes
she
met
were
full
of
sweet
understanding
dawn
what
a
beautiful
name
how
glad
i
am
it
is
that
it
just
fits
you
as
i
saw
you
first
you
might
have
been
personifying
dawn
you
shall
be
the
dawn
of
my
morning
always
they
were
in
sight
of
the
now
and
as
they
saw
that
the
driver
was
preparing
to
start
they
had
to
hurry
to
it
so
they
had
no
further
opportunity
to
talk
but
each
had
been
given
a
vision
into
the
heart
of
the
other
dawn
was
still
ignorant
of
where
she
was
going
and
as
she
sat
in
the
coach
and
saw
others
climbing
in
to
fill
the
seats
she
suddenly
realized
that
there
would
be
no
more
opportunity
now
for
the
questions
she
should
have
asked
while
they
were
walking
but
she
had
hesitated
to
spoil
their
pleasant
walk
and
had
dismissed
her
fears
and
troubles
entering
into
the
spirit
that
charles
had
seemed
to
manifest
as
he
sat
close
beside
her
through
the
long
miles
his
arm
rested
against
hers
and
now
and
again
came
a
gentle
pressure
as
if
he
would
let
her
know
he
was
there
then
the
remembrance
of
his
lips
upon
hers
swelled
over
her
in
a
mingling
of
remorse
and
joy
and
her
heart
cried
out
to
itself
oh
i
love
him
i
love
him
what
shall
i
do
if
i
only
were
not
married
perhaps
i
might
have
him
for
a
friend
i
never
had
a
real
friend
but
now
i
suppose
i
can
never
see
him
any
more
by
and
by
when
they
stopped
to
change
horses
charles
found
seats
for
them
on
the
top
of
the
coach
with
the
driver
it
was
lovely
up
there
with
a
wide
view
of
the
beautiful
country
through
which
they
were
riding
and
no
one
to
bother
them
for
the
old
coach
driver
was
not
of
a
garrulous
disposition
as
most
of
those
worthies
were
and
they
had
their
talk
to
themselves
still
he
was
there
and
dawn
dared
venture
no
more
confidential
questions
the
day
drew
to
a
close
and
they
came
to
the
last
change
of
horses
before
reaching
the
home
of
the
winthrops
chapter
xiv
we
are
almost
home
said
charles
joyously
he
felt
that
it
was
a
very
happy
moment
oh
are
we
going
to
your
home
she
asked
catching
her
breath
and
wondering
what
that
meant
why
yes
didn
t
you
know
i
supposed
van
rensselaer
would
tell
you
all
the
plans
she
said
you
did
not
wish
to
come
down
to
talk
them
over
beforehand
i
know
said
dawn
a
shadow
creeping
over
the
happy
face
i
could
not
she
looked
at
him
with
appealing
eyes
as
if
she
knew
he
would
understand
i
understood
he
answered
her
you
had
been
through
too
heavy
a
strain
a
he
paused
she
looked
puzzled
and
wondered
how
he
knew
that
her
marriage
was
a
shock
to
her
was
it
because
his
eyes
understood
her
from
the
first
was
it
a
kind
of
spirit
understanding
spirit
dawn
was
not
a
philosopher
but
something
like
this
flashed
through
her
thoughts
but
she
told
me
nothing
indeed
i
did
not
ask
perhaps
it
was
my
fault
she
added
certainly
not
said
charles
vehemently
it
was
her
business
to
tell
you
the
plans
i
expressly
asked
her
to
do
so
after
we
had
them
all
arranged
i
asked
her
to
see
if
they
had
your
approval
i
should
not
have
made
any
arrangements
without
it
oh
dawn
had
never
had
her
approval
of
anything
asked
in
her
life
she
could
scarcely
understand
why
it
should
be
done
it
was
very
nice
but
how
and
why
did
this
delightful
person
seem
to
have
had
the
arranging
of
her
plans
it
was
all
a
mystery
but
she
could
not
ask
about
it
now
before
the
coach
driver
perhaps
the
future
would
unravel
the
mystery
just
how
much
did
she
tell
you
any
way
asked
charles
lowering
his
voice
as
much
as
possible
to
make
it
confidential
without
actually
putting
it
beyond
the
hearing
of
the
driver
dawn
considered
why
i
don
t
really
think
she
told
me
anything
she
said
at
last
half
apologetically
except
how
to
behave
during
the
ceremony
i
think
it
was
my
fault
i
really
do
she
said
i
ought
to
go
down
and
talk
it
over
but
i
said
i
didn
t
need
to
go
that
i
wanted
to
be
by
myself
at
the
last
i
suppose
she
thought
i
didn
t
care
about
the
arrangements
i
never
thought
i
had
anything
to
do
with
them
any
way
i
thought
that
was
all
fixed
like
everything
else
there
was
a
sad
little
droop
to
the
corners
of
her
red
lips
which
gave
charles
s
heart
an
unhappy
twinge
the
driver
turned
a
suspicious
eye
toward
them
and
they
sat
silent
for
a
while
charles
thinking
it
over
and
being
somehow
depressed
that
she
should
feel
so
about
their
marriage
to
her
of
course
it
must
be
somewhat
of
a
forced
thing
but
to
him
it
had
been
all
joy
until
now
when
he
was
suddenly
brought
face
to
face
with
the
situation
as
he
thought
he
saw
it
dawn
was
going
over
sadly
all
their
bright
beautiful
day
together
and
thinking
wondering
how
near
it
was
to
the
end
and
whether
she
would
ever
see
this
dear
companion
again
she
treasured
every
moment
of
his
company
even
when
they
were
silent
together
every
glance
every
syllable
yes
every
kiss
and
gentle
touch
of
his
hand
even
while
she
dimly
perceived
and
chided
herself
that
this
was
not
the
right
attitude
for
a
bride
of
a
few
hours
to
have
toward
a
man
who
was
not
her
husband
but
to
her
it
was
like
stolen
sunshine
to
a
lifetime
prisoner
she
felt
she
must
take
it
as
it
would
never
pass
her
way
again
all
the
same
her
conscience
was
beginning
to
trouble
her
for
she
was
naturally
a
girl
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
her
ideals
of
married
life
were
not
as
some
girls
she
had
her
own
ideas
of
what
should
be
she
turned
toward
him
suddenly
i
want
to
tell
you
how
much
i
thank
you
for
this
beautiful
day
she
said
her
heart
in
her
eyes
it
is
the
best
day
i
ever
mean
our
part
of
it
i
was
afraid
i
might
not
have
another
chance
to
tell
you
the
dusk
was
growing
deeper
now
and
dim
lights
ahead
showed
that
a
town
was
not
far
away
charles
reached
out
his
hand
and
took
hers
gently
in
his
own
hiding
them
both
under
his
coat
on
the
seat
between
them
the
driver
was
looking
the
other
way
hunting
for
his
big
tin
horn
wherewith
to
announce
his
approach
somewhere
and
had
not
seen
dear
you
dear
charles
murmured
softly
in
her
ear
but
there
ll
be
plenty
of
chances
to
tell
me
everything
soon
now
oh
will
there
she
said
joyfully
i
was
afraid
there
wouldn
t
be
did
you
think
we
were
going
to
spend
our
days
in
a
coach
he
laughed
dawn
s
hand
trembled
in
the
big
comforting
grasp
and
longed
to
settle
down
and
take
strength
from
it
but
she
knew
she
ought
to
put
a
stop
to
this
and
she
sat
shrinking
and
pondering
how
to
draw
away
her
hand
without
offending
her
kind
friend
who
in
spite
of
his
frank
true
eyes
seemed
not
to
have
a
thought
but
that
the
course
he
was
pursuing
was
perfectly
right
and
proper
it
all
puzzled
her
more
and
more
as
she
felt
the
approach
of
the
moment
when
she
must
meet
her
unwelcome
bridegroom
a
long
blast
on
the
driver
s
horn
sent
a
startled
shock
through
her
slender
frame
and
instantly
charles
s
grasp
on
the
little
timid
hand
tightened
as
if
he
would
enfold
her
in
his
greater
strength
and
soothe
her
fears
she
was
glad
it
was
dark
for
she
was
sure
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
yet
she
dared
not
lift
her
other
hand
to
wipe
them
away
lest
he
see
her
with
a
swirl
and
a
lurch
the
coach
turned
in
at
an
open
gateway
and
drove
furiously
up
to
a
wide
on
a
hill
behind
a
circle
of
elm
trees
the
driver
jumped
down
and
began
to
unfasten
a
trunk
from
behind
dawn
could
not
see
whether
it
was
her
own
or
not
but
she
took
heart
from
the
fact
that
charles
sat
still
and
steadily
held
her
hand
and
that
other
people
were
climbing
out
of
the
coach
below
and
talking
to
a
man
and
woman
who
came
out
of
the
big
hall
door
in
a
stream
of
light
to
greet
them
this
was
not
her
new
home
yet
then
there
were
still
a
few
moments
more
of
grace
before
her
doom
should
fall
now
she
must
know
it
was
her
only
chance
in
a
moment
more
the
driver
would
be
back
beside
them
and
perhaps
the
next
stop
would
end
their
ride
she
leaned
over
close
to
charles
and
whispered
in
his
ear
tell
me
quick
before
the
driver
comes
back
will
be
there
the
tears
were
trembling
on
her
lashes
she
was
glad
she
was
not
on
the
side
of
the
coach
next
to
the
house
will
who
be
there
dear
murmured
charles
marvelling
at
the
sweetness
of
having
her
so
close
to
him
oh
don
t
you
know
she
said
desperately
as
if
it
hurt
her
to
speak
the
name
harrington
winthrop
it
was
a
pitiful
attempt
to
put
into
the
name
the
dignity
that
her
position
as
wife
demanded
she
was
scarcely
more
than
a
little
girl
and
her
situation
was
terrible
to
her
charles
started
and
looked
down
at
her
was
she
still
wanting
to
see
the
man
who
had
sought
to
do
her
so
terrible
an
injury
or
was
she
dreading
to
see
him
he
looked
at
her
and
saw
fear
written
in
her
eyes
and
his
heart
was
touched
however
she
might
have
felt
toward
harrington
before
of
course
now
she
dreaded
having
to
meet
him
after
what
he
had
done
but
whatever
had
put
into
her
head
the
idea
that
he
would
be
there
how
strange
of
van
rensselaer
not
to
have
told
her
that
harrington
had
gone
away
on
the
train
with
his
wife
no
he
will
not
be
there
he
said
almost
harshly
i
doubt
if
he
is
ever
there
again
there
was
something
in
his
tone
that
dawn
could
not
understand
but
she
must
find
out
quickly
what
it
all
meant
though
she
was
trembling
now
from
head
to
foot
and
scarcely
knew
what
question
to
ask
next
it
was
all
so
strange
and
mixed
up
then
will
i
have
to
meet
him
she
asked
grasping
his
arm
with
her
free
hand
and
watching
his
face
as
if
her
very
life
depended
upon
the
answer
charles
looked
down
at
her
his
whole
soul
in
his
eyes
never
dear
never
i
will
guard
you
from
that
at
least
oh
why
cried
dawn
more
than
ever
bewildered
by
his
words
how
can
you
hasn
t
he
the
right
wasn
t
i
married
to
him
this
morning
nobody
can
keep
us
apart
now
can
they
the
minister
said
till
death
do
you
part
a
long
slow
shudder
passed
over
her
as
she
spoke
and
though
her
words
were
low
lest
some
one
hear
her
tone
was
like
the
cry
of
one
who
had
given
up
for
lost
forgetting
the
people
who
were
clattering
joyous
welcomes
below
charles
put
his
arm
close
about
her
as
if
he
were
shielding
her
from
a
present
terrible
danger
he
looked
into
her
face
and
spoke
in
low
firm
tones
i
don
t
just
seem
to
understand
you
dear
but
you
mustn
t
be
so
frightened
there
isn
t
anything
in
the
world
to
be
afraid
of
i
will
try
to
make
everything
just
as
you
want
but
how
can
you
dawn
s
breath
came
in
short
sobs
she
was
almost
at
the
limit
of
her
will
he
let
you
will
it
be
right
dear
listen
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
by
some
of
the
things
you
have
said
i
m
afraid
all
the
trouble
has
upset
you
perhaps
you
have
a
no
no
said
dawn
almost
impatiently
for
she
saw
that
the
driver
had
landed
the
trunk
on
the
piazza
and
was
preparing
to
come
back
to
the
coach
and
that
some
of
the
passengers
were
climbing
in
again
there
would
be
but
a
moment
more
it
is
i
that
do
not
understand
she
added
and
her
voice
was
very
steady
she
felt
as
if
she
must
make
her
meaning
plain
now
i
was
married
to
him
this
morning
and
now
he
is
gone
away
somewhere
and
you
say
i
need
never
see
him
again
he
went
away
just
after
the
ceremony
they
said
his
mother
fainted
and
he
took
her
away
i
have
not
seen
him
since
what
does
it
all
mean
i
do
not
understand
it
is
like
some
awful
dream
charles
s
heart
sank
in
horror
as
he
listened
to
her
words
had
she
lost
her
mind
or
more
awful
yet
had
she
in
some
mysterious
way
been
married
to
him
without
knowing
it
the
latter
seemed
almost
incredible
yet
if
it
were
true
what
sorrow
might
it
not
mean
to
them
both
poor
child
he
must
be
very
gentle
with
her
whatever
were
the
case
and
meantime
the
driver
s
foot
was
upon
the
wheel
charles
leaned
over
as
if
to
tuck
the
linen
robe
about
her
to
protect
her
from
the
dust
and
whispered
you
were
not
married
to
him
at
all
don
t
you
remember
do
you
mean
i
was
not
married
then
but
i
heard
the
minister
say
the
words
i
pronounce
you
husband
and
wife
and
what
god
hath
dawn
shuddered
again
i
heard
it
i
didn
t
look
up
but
i
heard
it
you
needn
t
be
afraid
to
tell
me
the
truth
i
will
not
cry
or
anything
the
driver
plumped
down
on
the
seat
with
a
loud
laugh
at
some
joke
the
old
farmer
was
getting
off
and
vowed
he
would
be
late
if
they
kept
him
any
longer
that
he
must
go
around
by
applebee
s
and
deacon
forsythe
s
yet
and
it
was
almost
dark
then
with
another
hearty
laugh
he
chirruped
to
his
horses
and
they
strained
and
started
and
with
a
lurch
and
a
swirl
of
the
coach
they
were
flying
down
the
stony
road
to
the
gate
again
and
there
was
no
more
opportunity
to
talk
unheard
dawn
braced
herself
to
endure
the
awful
uncertainty
that
her
question
had
put
into
tangible
form
and
charles
as
he
took
hold
of
the
little
trembling
hand
once
more
with
a
reassuring
pressure
sought
in
his
mind
for
something
to
say
which
should
calm
her
fears
and
at
the
same
time
not
enlighten
the
driver
as
to
their
subject
of
conversation
don
t
worry
he
said
in
a
tone
that
tried
to
be
light
and
gay
i
ll
explain
it
all
as
soon
as
we
get
home
meantime
do
you
want
to
be
told
where
we
are
and
he
launched
into
a
voluble
description
of
the
people
who
dwelt
along
the
road
dawn
understood
and
kept
silent
except
for
a
monosyllable
now
and
then
to
keep
up
appearances
before
the
driver
and
presently
the
coach
halted
again
before
the
gate
of
another
where
the
gleaming
candles
from
the
windows
testified
to
the
comfort
of
the
inhabitants
to
their
relief
the
driver
jumped
down
again
to
deliver
a
big
package
and
they
had
another
moment
to
talk
wasn
t
i
married
at
all
then
tell
me
quick
please
she
pleaded
the
minute
the
driver
had
left
them
yes
but
not
to
harrington
he
said
gravely
he
had
not
yet
decided
how
he
ought
to
tell
her
or
whether
he
had
not
better
wait
until
they
were
at
home
lest
it
make
her
ill
it
seemed
so
strange
for
her
to
talk
in
this
way
he
paused
an
instant
and
looked
keenly
into
her
face
but
the
light
from
the
coach
lantern
did
not
shine
in
the
right
way
for
him
to
see
her
clearly
and
it
was
dark
now
he
did
not
see
the
wave
of
relief
that
swept
over
her
anxious
face
oh
she
gasped
as
if
a
great
burden
had
suddenly
been
lifted
from
her
and
she
could
breathe
the
free
air
again
oh
and
for
a
minute
she
could
think
of
nothing
else
save
that
she
was
free
from
the
man
she
had
come
to
dread
almost
more
than
death
how
it
came
about
or
what
else
might
have
happened
must
stand
in
abeyance
until
she
could
take
in
this
great
truth
she
was
not
married
to
harrington
winthrop
charles
waited
an
instant
and
then
seeing
that
the
driver
would
soon
be
back
and
that
dawn
was
not
going
to
ask
a
question
to
help
him
on
he
spoke
again
don
t
you
remember
dawn
voice
lingered
over
the
name
the
first
time
he
had
used
it
and
it
went
through
her
heart
with
a
wonderful
don
t
you
remember
that
you
and
i
were
married
this
morning
oh
was
it
you
dawn
s
face
shone
up
at
him
out
of
the
darkness
but
he
dared
not
interpret
the
look
the
driver
suddenly
jumped
up
on
the
seat
and
started
the
horses
on
again
but
dawn
clasped
her
hands
close
about
his
arm
and
clung
to
him
in
the
darkness
her
whole
soul
surging
with
gladness
he
held
her
arm
close
to
him
within
his
own
but
his
heart
was
beating
anxiously
to
know
what
effect
this
would
have
upon
her
and
whether
she
remembered
now
at
last
she
ventured
the
how
could
the
driver
attach
any
significance
to
such
simple
words
are
you
sure
sure
he
answered
gravely
and
added
as
if
he
could
not
keep
the
words
back
are
you
glad
or
sorry
oh
glad
glad
instantly
came
the
words
and
then
they
said
no
more
but
let
the
joy
and
the
wonder
of
it
sweep
over
them
they
were
both
very
young
and
very
happy
just
then
and
what
are
hows
and
whys
to
such
as
they
the
lights
of
the
village
grew
closer
and
beamed
past
them
and
in
a
moment
more
with
a
rattle
and
flourish
they
drew
up
before
the
old
winthrop
house
a
beautiful
colonial
structure
with
lights
in
all
the
windows
and
a
festive
air
about
it
that
made
all
the
passengers
in
the
coach
look
out
and
wonder
a
shout
of
laughter
and
here
they
come
was
heard
from
the
house
and
betty
in
white
with
blue
ribbons
all
in
a
flutter
came
flying
down
the
path
of
light
from
the
open
door
to
greet
them
i
ll
explain
it
all
when
we
get
by
ourselves
dear
whispered
charles
leaning
over
her
again
as
if
to
see
if
she
was
leaving
any
baggage
behind
don
t
worry
just
be
happy
oh
i
will
laughed
dawn
joyously
but
how
did
it
ever
come
to
be
true
and
then
as
she
got
down
from
the
coach
she
was
instantly
smothered
in
betty
s
open
arms
chapter
xv
do
they
all
know
and
understand
whispered
dawn
to
charles
as
they
turned
to
walk
up
to
the
house
betty
fluttering
ahead
carrying
dawn
s
and
silk
cape
yes
they
all
know
and
understand
dear
it
is
all
right
said
charles
reassuringly
old
winthrop
stooped
and
kissed
her
as
she
came
up
the
steps
and
said
welcome
home
daughter
cordelia
and
madeleine
too
made
her
warmly
welcome
just
behind
them
stood
aunt
martha
with
arms
spread
wide
to
receive
her
in
a
motherly
embrace
mother
is
lying
down
resting
now
explained
betty
and
sent
word
she
would
see
you
after
supper
they
bore
dawn
off
to
the
second
story
where
betty
took
entire
possession
of
her
and
showed
her
the
rooms
they
had
hastily
prepared
for
of
course
harrington
had
not
intended
bringing
his
prospective
bride
home
and
betty
and
her
sisters
had
had
much
ado
to
put
things
in
bridal
array
after
their
own
arrival
home
from
the
wedding
we
ll
get
some
of
these
pictures
and
things
out
of
your
way
so
you
will
have
room
for
your
own
things
but
we
hadn
t
much
time
you
know
we
got
home
only
two
hours
ahead
of
you
if
we
did
come
by
a
shorter
cut
horses
can
not
travel
as
fast
as
railroad
trains
i
guess
chattered
betty
do
you
think
you
will
be
comfortable
or
i
could
take
some
more
things
out
if
you
want
to
unpack
your
own
she
added
anxiously
dawn
looked
around
on
the
exquisitely
appointed
rooms
the
great
bedroom
with
bed
curtains
and
valance
of
chintz
to
match
the
window
draperies
the
of
dreamy
landscapes
with
hazy
blue
skies
and
rivers
winding
like
blue
ribbons
among
sunny
hills
the
fine
old
mahogany
furniture
the
little
glow
of
fire
in
the
open
fireplace
with
the
great
stuffed
chair
drawn
up
before
seemed
like
heaven
to
her
through
the
open
door
one
entered
a
hastily
improvised
private
the
girls
had
had
the
furniture
taken
from
the
connecting
bedroom
and
in
its
place
had
put
a
desk
chairs
and
bookcase
of
mahogany
candles
burned
brightly
everywhere
in
silver
candlesticks
with
tall
glass
over
them
some
books
and
papers
were
scattered
on
the
table
and
a
comfortable
chair
stood
ready
for
some
one
to
occupy
the
rooms
could
not
have
been
more
and
all
this
was
for
her
she
caught
her
breath
with
the
happiness
of
it
and
a
pink
tinge
stole
into
her
cheeks
do
you
think
you
can
be
happy
here
betty
asked
anxiously
oh
happier
than
i
ever
was
in
my
life
cried
dawn
only
it
seems
too
beautiful
to
be
true
it
seems
as
if
i
was
dreaming
and
in
a
pretty
little
way
she
had
when
she
was
surprised
and
pleased
she
clasped
her
hands
over
her
heart
oh
i
m
so
glad
said
betty
and
let
me
whisper
a
secret
i
always
loved
charles
more
than
harrington
charles
is
a
dear
dawn
s
eyes
shone
with
her
deep
joy
oh
do
you
was
all
she
could
say
but
she
wished
she
dared
tell
betty
that
she
was
a
dear
also
then
her
little
went
away
and
left
her
to
wash
her
hands
and
smooth
her
hair
for
supper
and
in
a
moment
charles
came
in
dawn
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
looking
about
her
eyes
shining
the
firelight
glimmering
over
her
dark
hair
and
bringing
out
the
green
lights
in
the
silk
frock
she
wore
she
looked
so
young
and
sweet
and
dear
as
she
stood
there
alone
taking
in
the
picture
of
her
new
home
that
charles
paused
to
watch
her
and
then
came
softly
up
and
folded
his
arms
reverently
about
her
drawing
her
close
it
was
a
long
beautiful
moment
of
perfect
bliss
the
memory
of
which
stayed
with
the
two
through
all
that
came
afterward
then
their
lips
met
and
sealed
the
sacredness
of
their
union
but
betty
s
voice
broke
in
upon
the
joy
charles
the
supper
is
getting
cold
and
you
know
i
told
you
to
bring
her
down
at
once
come
quick
reluctantly
they
prepared
to
go
one
minute
betty
charles
called
i
must
wash
my
hands
first
charles
you
know
you
are
just
admiring
your
wife
and
not
hurrying
a
bit
called
back
saucy
betty
do
make
haste
i
want
to
admire
her
myself
before
we
go
down
dawn
i
must
say
one
word
don
t
let
them
know
anything
about
your
not
knowing
they
think
that
you
understood
it
all
and
were
willing
i
can
t
see
how
it
happened
van
rensselaer
went
upstairs
last
night
to
tell
you
all
about
harrington
and
to
take
my
offer
to
you
and
when
she
came
down
she
said
you
wanted
to
think
it
over
the
deep
color
came
in
dawn
s
cheeks
and
the
flash
into
her
eyes
she
did
not
speak
to
me
last
night
after
you
came
she
said
but
in
the
morning
after
i
saw
you
in
the
she
tell
you
nothing
then
she
only
talked
to
me
about
the
wedding
and
told
me
i
must
not
look
up
during
the
ceremony
that
it
was
not
nice
that
seemed
to
be
the
only
thing
she
cared
about
didn
t
she
tell
you
at
all
about
harrington
not
a
word
except
that
i
ought
to
go
down
and
talk
with
him
before
the
ceremony
was
he
asking
for
me
the
dark
eyes
took
on
their
frightened
look
charles
frowned
heavily
behind
the
big
damask
towel
with
which
he
was
drying
his
face
never
mind
dear
harrington
has
behaved
outrageously
but
we
will
not
talk
about
it
now
i
m
ashamed
to
call
him
my
brother
oh
he
is
your
brother
isn
t
he
said
dawn
suddenly
perceiving
the
fact
of
course
didn
t
you
know
even
that
what
could
the
woman
have
been
thinking
about
what
object
could
your
mother
possibly
have
had
in
not
telling
you
everything
charles
betty
s
voice
was
insistent
now
yes
betty
just
ready
answered
charles
impatiently
she
is
not
my
mother
you
know
and
she
never
liked
me
said
dawn
in
a
low
voice
as
if
she
were
ashamed
of
it
all
never
mind
dear
let
s
forget
it
now
and
be
happy
he
stooped
and
drew
her
face
against
his
for
just
an
instant
and
then
they
went
out
to
the
impatient
betty
downstairs
it
was
all
gaiety
and
brightness
once
charles
said
with
a
soft
light
in
his
eyes
i
m
sorry
mother
couldn
t
be
down
how
is
she
feeling
now
and
dawn
looked
at
him
in
awe
and
love
and
thought
how
beautiful
it
was
to
have
a
mother
that
one
longed
to
have
about
your
mother
will
be
all
right
in
the
morning
i
think
answered
his
father
with
just
a
tinge
of
sadness
in
his
voice
and
a
quietness
settled
over
them
all
for
a
moment
dawn
thought
it
was
because
they
loved
her
so
much
and
were
sorry
she
was
sick
we
didn
t
ask
any
of
the
neighbors
in
because
we
thought
you
would
be
so
tired
and
it
would
be
better
to
wait
till
you
were
rested
so
we
could
have
a
real
party
and
do
things
up
nicely
not
in
such
a
hurry
they
don
t
even
know
yet
that
charles
is
married
you
know
betty
s
voice
gushed
into
the
pause
that
had
come
in
the
conversation
as
if
she
wished
to
fill
it
quickly
no
matter
with
what
yes
that
s
right
approved
charles
we
don
t
want
a
lot
of
folks
around
we
just
want
you
folks
for
a
while
after
supper
cordelia
took
dawn
up
to
their
mother
s
room
dawn
s
heart
beat
high
with
hope
she
had
caught
but
a
glimpse
of
charles
s
mother
that
morning
and
did
not
remember
clearly
how
she
looked
the
young
bride
s
heart
went
out
to
her
with
a
double
love
because
her
own
lost
mother
had
been
so
dear
winthrop
was
lying
in
a
great
bed
with
a
canopy
the
were
of
white
starched
dimity
and
the
white
linen
all
about
her
made
her
look
like
some
delicate
flower
in
an
elaborate
vase
the
canopy
threw
tints
on
the
delicate
complexion
that
had
not
darkened
in
spite
of
years
and
the
rosy
light
from
the
open
fire
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
played
over
her
beautiful
white
hair
that
was
carefully
arranged
in
curls
on
her
cheeks
the
she
wore
was
of
homespun
linen
fine
and
elaborate
in
make
her
small
patrician
hands
were
glowing
with
rare
jewels
the
delicate
face
was
that
of
a
beautiful
woman
beautiful
yet
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
had
grown
old
beautiful
and
proud
yet
lovable
she
looked
like
some
rare
bit
of
dresden
china
perfect
of
its
kind
and
perfectly
cared
for
dawn
paused
on
the
threshold
shyly
and
admired
her
then
she
came
forward
at
cordelia
s
introduction
but
instead
of
taking
the
delicate
hand
that
was
held
out
coldly
to
greet
her
she
stooped
over
impulsively
and
kissed
her
new
mother
she
had
never
done
such
a
thing
to
any
one
since
her
own
mother
died
but
she
wanted
to
give
her
best
to
charles
s
mother
she
was
so
glad
sit
down
the
voice
commanded
politely
yes
there
in
the
chair
where
i
can
see
you
cordelia
you
need
not
remain
dawn
sat
down
and
there
was
a
pause
until
the
door
closed
after
cordelia
somehow
the
young
wife
s
heart
began
to
sink
a
little
the
room
looked
so
very
large
the
bed
was
so
high
and
big
the
beautiful
old
lady
so
small
and
far
away
and
her
smile
was
so
like
a
picture
madam
winthrop
turned
her
handsome
eyes
with
an
uncordial
coolness
upon
her
new
and
looked
her
through
she
was
a
loving
and
lovable
woman
at
times
but
she
did
not
seem
so
now
i
have
sent
for
you
spoke
the
words
with
deliberation
and
to
tell
you
that
i
forgive
you
dawn
gasped
and
looked
at
her
in
amazement
but
the
lady
paid
no
heed
to
her
only
further
to
fix
her
with
her
eyes
and
went
on
i
did
not
think
it
would
be
possible
at
first
but
i
have
conquered
my
feelings
and
am
now
willing
to
forgive
you
dawn
could
do
nothing
but
look
at
the
woman
in
horror
her
tongue
seemed
tied
at
last
she
stammered
out
for
what
that
is
an
entirely
unnecessary
question
said
the
cool
voice
you
surely
know
how
much
trouble
you
have
made
it
is
absurd
to
ignore
it
or
try
to
gloss
it
over
it
seems
strange
that
one
so
young
as
you
should
have
had
the
power
to
make
my
poor
impulsive
boy
forget
his
duty
you
should
have
then
i
have
forgiven
you
and
i
will
say
no
more
about
that
you
are
very
beautiful
i
must
admit
and
harrington
was
always
one
who
admired
beauty
but
i
feel
sure
that
of
himself
he
would
never
have
gone
as
far
as
he
did
however
as
i
say
we
will
not
talk
of
that
i
have
forgiven
it
together
of
course
with
your
other
offences
and
it
is
of
the
consequences
of
those
that
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
speak
to
you
dawn
sat
watching
her
fascinated
as
is
a
bird
sometimes
when
it
keeps
its
eyes
on
a
cat
and
is
unable
to
move
it
seemed
to
her
she
would
scream
if
she
only
had
the
power
but
the
power
of
speech
was
gone
for
the
time
being
you
know
of
course
that
charles
is
very
young
he
isn
t
really
a
man
yet
he
hasn
t
finished
his
college
course
you
ought
to
understand
that
you
must
in
no
way
interfere
with
his
life
to
spoil
it
it
ought
to
be
enough
for
you
that
you
have
accepted
his
generous
offer
when
he
was
sorry
for
your
being
jilted
by
his
brother
and
kindly
offered
to
take
his
place
so
as
to
save
you
from
the
mortification
of
having
no
wedding
i
haven
t
an
idea
that
charles
really
expected
you
to
think
of
it
for
a
moment
but
he
is
and
always
ready
to
offer
help
in
any
distress
it
would
have
been
far
more
seemly
in
you
to
decline
the
offer
and
in
your
people
to
insist
upon
your
doing
so
if
you
did
not
know
enough
to
do
it
yourself
but
that
is
now
too
late
to
mend
so
we
will
not
speak
of
it
and
as
i
have
said
i
have
fully
forgiven
it
what
is
unalterable
is
always
best
forgiven
if
possible
what
i
wish
to
say
is
this
having
married
my
son
under
these
most
extraordinary
circumstances
it
becomes
you
to
be
most
modest
and
retiring
and
hereafter
to
put
aside
every
personal
consideration
in
order
that
he
may
not
be
held
back
from
his
natural
ambitions
i
hope
you
get
my
meaning
a
crimson
flush
had
been
stealing
up
into
dawn
s
cheeks
and
the
steel
lights
were
coming
into
her
eyes
but
she
was
unable
as
yet
to
make
any
reply
the
cool
elder
voice
went
on
with
the
torture
i
am
willing
as
i
say
to
forgive
you
but
i
shall
expect
from
you
docility
and
a
willingness
to
be
guided
by
me
in
everything
as
long
as
you
remain
in
my
house
which
will
of
course
be
at
least
as
long
as
my
son
remains
in
college
and
as
much
longer
as
he
deems
wise
afterward
i
thought
it
was
best
for
you
to
understand
everything
thoroughly
at
the
start
having
robbed
one
of
my
sons
of
his
happiness
and
robbed
me
of
the
other
one
it
is
becoming
that
you
should
walk
circumspectly
in
every
way
i
have
of
course
forgiven
you
but
it
is
a
terrible
thing
which
you
have
stop
dawn
sprang
to
her
feet
her
hands
clasped
her
face
white
with
anger
the
lightning
in
her
eyes
you
are
saying
things
that
are
not
true
you
are
blaming
me
for
what
i
have
not
done
i
will
not
hear
another
word
of
it
i
did
not
want
to
marry
your
son
harrington
he
came
after
me
while
i
was
in
school
and
tormented
me
to
marry
him
afterward
he
told
my
father
and
made
him
think
it
was
all
fixed
between
us
and
father
wrote
and
gave
his
consent
and
they
planned
the
wedding
and
everything
without
asking
me
a
thing
about
it
i
did
not
want
to
go
home
because
i
was
frightened
i
did
not
want
to
be
married
i
knew
father
would
be
angry
if
i
should
break
it
off
after
everything
was
arranged
he
is
very
proud
and
has
a
terrible
temper
but
i
dreaded
it
so
that
i
was
almost
crazy
i
don
t
know
yet
how
it
came
about
that
harrington
didn
t
come
to
the
wedding
no
one
has
told
me
and
i
hadn
t
thought
to
ask
i
was
so
glad
to
find
i
wasn
t
married
to
him
i
didn
t
know
anything
about
being
married
to
your
other
son
i
thought
i
was
being
married
just
as
it
was
planned
harrington
i
don
t
know
how
that
happened
either
i
haven
t
had
time
to
ask
charles
yet
i
just
found
out
a
few
minutes
ago
that
he
and
i
had
been
married
that
is
a
highly
improbable
story
began
the
astonished
woman
in
the
bed
you
will
not
gain
anything
by
telling
me
tales
like
that
nothing
but
the
strict
truth
is
ever
spoken
in
this
family
you
will
only
bring
trouble
upon
yourself
by
telling
what
is
not
true
besides
you
certainly
know
that
i
would
not
believe
a
thing
like
that
in
the
first
place
why
shouldn
t
you
want
to
marry
harrington
he
certainly
is
as
good
as
you
are
and
the
very
idea
that
a
girl
in
her
senses
could
be
married
without
her
own
consent
it
would
be
impossible
to
be
married
and
not
know
it
dawn
stood
quite
still
for
a
full
minute
surveying
her
antagonist
the
beautiful
color
had
flown
into
her
cheeks
again
at
mention
of
untruth
but
as
was
her
wont
in
moments
of
great
provocation
she
had
herself
under
perfect
control
the
elder
woman
acknowledged
to
herself
that
the
girl
was
very
beautiful
and
lay
there
watching
her
victim
with
a
degree
of
satisfaction
she
would
not
have
felt
could
she
have
known
what
was
passing
in
the
girl
s
mind
dawn
s
voice
was
clear
and
controlled
when
she
spoke
again
all
excitement
seemed
to
have
gone
out
of
it
but
every
word
went
straight
to
the
mark
like
sharp
steel
you
say
i
have
robbed
you
of
your
son
you
may
have
him
back
again
at
once
i
did
not
ask
him
to
marry
me
and
i
can
not
stay
in
your
house
if
you
doubt
my
word
i
shall
never
trouble
either
of
you
again
she
turned
swiftly
and
silently
and
went
out
of
the
room
closing
the
door
noiselessly
behind
her
the
old
lady
lay
still
in
blank
astonishment
for
any
one
to
speak
to
her
in
that
manner
was
unprecedented
to
disappear
and
leave
no
opportunity
for
rebuke
was
outrageous
she
felt
helpless
and
outgeneraled
not
in
years
had
her
superiority
been
so
rudely
set
aside
as
during
this
whole
affair
for
the
moment
she
was
bewildered
and
lay
thinking
it
over
unable
even
to
make
up
her
mind
whether
or
not
she
should
pull
the
bell
rope
and
call
some
of
the
family
to
tell
what
had
happened
truth
to
tell
she
was
mortified
that
her
plan
had
ended
so
ignominiously
dawn
went
swiftly
across
the
hall
to
the
door
of
her
own
room
which
she
had
left
so
joyously
a
short
hour
before
the
candles
had
burned
low
but
the
firelight
was
flickering
softly
over
everything
and
made
the
room
look
a
very
haven
of
comfort
the
poor
child
searched
it
furtively
now
to
make
sure
that
no
one
was
there
for
just
a
moment
she
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
looking
about
her
hands
clasped
tragically
over
her
heart
her
eyes
full
of
unspoken
agonies
the
whole
ugly
import
of
the
new
mother
s
words
swept
over
her
and
seemed
as
if
it
would
overwhelm
her
then
she
girded
herself
to
carry
out
the
resolution
she
had
formed
her
proud
nature
stung
to
the
quick
on
the
big
white
bed
lay
her
bonnet
and
mantle
it
was
the
work
of
but
a
moment
to
put
them
on
though
her
fingers
trembled
so
that
she
could
scarcely
tie
the
ribbons
under
her
chin
charles
had
unfastened
her
trunk
before
he
went
down
to
supper
and
set
it
open
for
her
there
on
the
top
where
she
had
slipped
it
in
after
her
had
shut
the
trunk
and
gone
downstairs
lay
the
sombre
gray
frock
she
had
worn
at
friend
ruth
s
school
she
had
put
it
in
with
sudden
impulse
as
being
the
only
thing
she
had
left
of
her
girlhood
van
rensselaer
had
seen
to
it
that
her
s
outfit
was
perfect
as
befitted
the
daughter
of
her
father
no
winthrop
should
criticise
her
for
lack
of
elaborate
and
costly
outfit
but
the
gray
dress
which
had
been
cast
aside
was
the
one
dawn
had
worn
afternoons
at
the
school
and
it
reminded
her
of
pleasant
days
among
the
girls
with
little
gray
girlhood
which
had
nevertheless
become
bright
in
comparison
to
the
new
life
she
snatched
the
gray
frock
and
in
it
wrapped
a
few
light
articles
she
felt
she
might
need
taking
only
necessities
and
of
those
but
few
these
she
rolled
tightly
in
the
frock
pinned
the
bundle
firmly
saw
that
it
could
be
hidden
under
her
mantle
caught
up
her
which
contained
a
purse
with
dollars
which
her
father
had
put
into
her
hands
when
she
left
home
and
was
ready
she
had
not
stopped
to
think
how
she
was
going
to
get
out
of
the
house
without
being
seen
a
glance
out
of
the
front
window
showed
a
balcony
with
a
railing
which
hung
inside
the
white
pillared
front
piazza
but
charles
and
his
father
sat
just
below
talking
in
low
pleasant
voices
she
could
not
get
out
that
way
equally
impossible
of
course
would
be
the
front
door
even
if
she
could
get
through
the
hall
without
betty
s
seeing
her
with
one
long
look
down
at
charles
she
put
out
a
protesting
hand
toward
him
as
if
bidding
him
farewell
it
wrung
her
heart
to
look
at
him
she
turned
quickly
away
paused
an
instant
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
swept
it
with
her
eyes
then
with
a
little
tragic
wave
of
renunciation
she
went
swiftly
into
the
room
beyond
the
open
desk
caught
her
attention
she
stopped
and
taking
up
a
pen
wrote
on
a
sheet
of
paper
goodby
i
had
to
she
wrote
hurriedly
feeling
that
she
had
but
a
brief
respite
for
her
flight
then
casting
down
the
pen
she
went
to
one
of
the
windows
in
the
room
and
looked
out
there
was
another
balcony
here
and
she
stepped
out
it
was
dark
but
the
from
the
showed
a
terrace
below
it
did
not
look
to
be
a
great
distance
for
an
ordinary
runaway
bride
this
balcony
would
have
been
impossible
as
a
mode
of
egress
but
dawn
and
her
schoolmates
had
practised
all
sorts
of
gymnastics
from
the
windows
and
roof
of
the
old
barn
and
even
on
the
gables
of
the
house
itself
she
knew
how
to
drop
like
a
cat
from
a
considerable
distance
she
could
swing
from
the
great
high
limb
of
the
old
cherry
tree
that
overlooked
the
hudson
longer
than
any
of
the
other
girls
and
then
drop
gracefully
in
their
midst
without
ruffling
her
composure
in
the
least
but
to
perform
such
a
feat
attired
in
her
first
long
dress
of
rustling
silk
with
a
bonnet
tied
under
her
chin
and
a
bundle
and
to
look
say
nothing
of
doing
it
in
an
unknown
and
almost
entirely
dark
another
thing
dawn
glanced
back
into
the
room
but
could
think
of
no
other
way
it
wouldn
t
be
pleasant
to
fall
and
break
her
leg
at
the
outset
but
she
fancied
she
heard
steps
coming
up
the
stairs
and
to
hesitate
might
bring
discovery
she
leaned
quickly
over
the
railing
of
the
balcony
and
dropped
her
bundle
down
to
the
terrace
it
fell
with
a
hushed
thud
among
the
tall
grass
and
did
not
sound
as
if
the
distance
were
great
twisting
the
cords
of
her
twice
about
her
wrist
she
swung
her
feet
over
the
railing
and
stood
on
the
outer
edge
of
the
balcony
holding
the
rail
lightly
and
shaking
out
her
skirt
so
that
it
would
not
impede
her
progress
then
she
cautiously
crept
down
holding
to
the
ironwork
of
the
railing
and
then
to
the
floor
of
the
balcony
and
hung
for
a
moment
to
get
her
breath
and
be
sure
of
herself
before
she
let
go
then
closing
her
eyes
she
dropped
to
the
terrace
like
a
thistledown
in
spite
of
the
voluminous
skirts
she
paused
an
instant
to
pick
up
her
bundle
and
make
sure
her
was
safe
then
gathering
her
skirt
and
holding
it
close
with
one
hand
that
her
feet
might
be
freer
she
sped
down
the
terrace
and
away
into
the
unknown
darkness
chapter
xvi
it
was
charles
who
had
come
up
the
stairs
he
had
grown
impatient
of
the
delay
and
come
in
search
of
his
wife
he
paused
before
his
mother
s
door
and
listened
to
hear
the
pleasant
voices
of
the
two
who
were
most
dear
to
him
he
had
pictured
them
getting
acquainted
with
each
other
and
he
meant
to
walk
in
and
say
that
the
time
was
up
and
he
must
not
be
kept
out
any
longer
he
listened
but
he
heard
nothing
he
waited
a
moment
longer
but
still
the
silence
what
could
it
mean
he
tapped
gently
at
the
door
and
called
mother
may
i
come
in
his
mother
gave
a
cold
assent
she
had
not
yet
recovered
from
the
shock
she
had
received
why
where
is
dawn
he
asked
pausing
on
the
threshold
and
looking
about
the
room
as
if
expecting
to
find
her
in
hiding
just
to
tease
him
perhaps
if
you
wish
to
come
in
please
have
the
goodness
to
close
the
door
after
you
charles
said
his
mother
severely
you
are
in
danger
of
forgetting
everybody
else
in
your
sudden
and
extraordinary
infatuation
the
joyous
spirit
of
the
young
man
came
down
to
earth
with
a
thud
and
he
closed
the
door
and
stood
looking
at
his
mother
blankly
as
if
to
try
to
fathom
the
look
in
her
face
your
wife
left
me
some
minutes
ago
his
mother
answered
the
question
which
his
eyes
repeated
she
spoke
haughtily
as
if
the
offence
had
been
partly
his
she
did
not
seem
to
enjoy
my
company
mother
said
charles
aghast
at
his
mother
s
tone
even
more
than
at
her
words
oh
yes
she
repeated
angered
anew
at
the
reproach
in
his
tone
i
suppose
it
will
be
that
from
now
on
she
left
the
room
declaring
her
intention
of
also
leaving
my
house
i
suppose
by
this
time
she
has
seen
the
impossibility
of
that
but
you
will
find
you
have
married
no
angel
i
can
tell
you
whatever
possessed
you
i
can
not
understand
such
a
little
spitfire
you
should
have
seen
her
great
eyes
flash
mother
what
had
you
been
saying
to
her
charles
tried
to
speak
gently
he
saw
that
here
was
something
that
needed
careful
handling
he
blamed
himself
inwardly
that
he
had
not
had
more
forethought
than
to
prevent
a
meeting
between
the
two
while
his
mother
was
still
wrought
up
over
his
brother
harrington
what
had
been
saying
to
indeed
charles
you
forget
yourself
you
would
better
ask
what
had
been
saying
to
in
her
indignation
madam
winthrop
rose
on
one
elbow
and
faced
her
son
i
had
been
most
kind
and
patient
and
forgiving
i
had
made
up
my
mind
for
your
sake
to
put
everything
by
and
i
sent
for
her
to
tell
her
so
i
told
her
i
would
forgive
her
all
she
had
done
to
spoil
your
brother
s
life
and
mother
you
never
told
her
that
charles
towered
above
the
little
woman
in
the
bed
every
inch
of
his
manhood
roused
in
honest
indignation
i
certainly
did
said
the
mother
her
own
anger
rising
anew
i
explained
the
whole
matter
to
her
and
told
her
i
would
forgive
her
entirely
and
then
just
because
i
suggested
some
things
she
might
do
to
help
you
who
are
so
young
and
inexperienced
and
who
had
so
generously
given
up
all
your
own
ambitions
just
to
save
her
from
a
few
hours
mortification
she
got
very
angry
she
turned
perfectly
white
and
her
eyes
looked
like
two
devils
you
wouldn
t
have
known
your
pretty
little
angel
if
you
had
seen
her
i
will
admit
of
course
that
she
is
pretty
but
handsome
is
that
handsome
does
is
a
very
true
adage
you
will
find
it
out
yet
she
was
most
me
that
i
was
lying
or
words
to
that
then
she
got
off
the
most
extraordinary
yarn
about
not
knowing
she
had
married
you
i
told
her
she
must
know
i
couldn
t
believe
such
a
story
as
that
and
now
that
i
think
it
over
i
don
t
see
how
she
can
be
quite
right
in
her
mind
perhaps
harrington
had
suspected
as
much
and
took
this
way
of
getting
out
of
a
most
unfortunate
union
and
you
were
so
blind
that
you
just
jumped
in
without
ever
waiting
to
make
an
mother
stop
charles
s
face
was
white
and
his
voice
was
trembling
with
suppressed
horror
remember
you
are
talking
about
my
wife
yes
your
wife
exclaimed
his
mother
beginning
to
cry
that
s
the
way
it
goes
a
child
forgets
all
his
mother
has
ever
done
the
minute
he
sees
a
pretty
silly
face
then
she
sat
up
with
sudden
resolution
well
your
wife
and
go
of
my
then
if
you
and
she
are
going
to
combine
against
me
and
dictate
to
me
how
i
shall
talk
then
with
a
moan
she
threw
herself
back
upon
her
pillows
and
lost
consciousness
again
charles
stood
looking
down
miserably
at
her
for
an
instant
his
mind
in
such
a
whirl
of
emotions
that
he
scarcely
knew
which
was
strongest
then
with
a
remembrance
of
dawn
he
turned
and
pulled
the
that
hung
by
the
head
of
his
mother
s
bed
these
fainting
spells
were
frequent
and
not
alarming
he
knew
stepping
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
he
called
betty
tell
aunt
martha
to
come
to
mother
at
once
she
has
fainted
again
he
waited
only
to
hear
aunt
martha
s
quick
excited
step
upon
the
stair
and
then
he
went
to
find
dawn
opening
the
door
of
the
it
startled
him
to
feel
the
emptiness
that
pervaded
the
place
he
had
expected
to
find
dawn
weeping
in
the
big
chair
or
perhaps
huddled
upon
the
bed
that
would
have
been
betty
s
way
he
had
often
acted
as
comforter
to
betty
during
her
childish
woes
even
in
his
anger
and
trouble
he
was
thrilling
at
the
thought
of
how
he
would
comfort
dawn
his
own
little
girl
he
was
the
only
one
in
all
the
world
now
to
whom
she
had
a
right
to
look
for
comfort
he
strode
through
the
rooms
hurriedly
looking
in
every
possible
place
for
her
and
unwilling
to
accept
the
conclusion
his
mind
had
instantly
jumped
to
that
she
was
not
there
at
all
he
even
pushed
aside
the
curtains
and
stepped
out
upon
first
the
front
balcony
and
then
the
side
one
thinking
that
she
had
taken
refuge
there
from
intrusion
by
betty
or
the
other
girls
but
there
was
no
sign
of
her
recent
step
and
in
the
darkness
the
tall
grass
down
below
on
the
terrace
told
no
tales
of
a
little
crushed
place
where
her
bundle
had
fallen
and
where
her
feet
had
rested
lightly
when
she
dropped
next
morning
before
any
one
would
think
to
look
the
grass
would
be
standing
tall
as
ever
and
they
would
never
know
how
she
went
stepping
back
into
the
room
again
charles
at
once
saw
the
writing
on
the
sheet
of
paper
lying
on
the
desk
when
he
had
read
it
he
caught
it
hastily
in
his
hand
as
if
it
could
give
him
some
clue
to
her
whereabouts
and
started
down
the
stairs
and
out
of
the
front
door
to
find
her
he
knew
only
one
thing
then
and
that
was
that
he
must
find
her
and
bring
her
back
before
any
one
else
discovered
her
flight
she
could
not
be
far
away
yet
charles
hurried
out
into
the
darkness
the
family
were
attending
to
the
mother
who
had
recovered
consciousness
he
could
hear
her
moaning
and
a
sudden
bitterness
came
over
his
soul
that
her
blindness
and
selfishness
should
make
them
all
so
much
trouble
he
had
never
thought
of
her
in
any
but
a
gentle
loving
way
before
and
it
shocked
his
spirit
to
have
to
think
differently
now
but
his
indignation
at
her
treatment
of
his
young
and
blameless
wife
was
roused
beyond
his
present
control
he
searched
the
grounds
and
garden
carefully
going
over
every
possible
twice
as
he
did
so
he
reflected
that
she
could
not
have
known
where
to
go
to
hide
and
he
felt
sure
he
would
find
her
in
a
minute
or
two
the
minutes
grew
into
thirty
and
he
had
found
no
trace
of
her
he
went
down
the
street
quite
a
distance
in
one
direction
only
to
be
sure
she
would
have
chosen
the
other
and
to
hurry
back
an
hour
passed
with
no
trace
of
her
and
then
he
began
systematically
to
go
over
the
grounds
again
calling
her
name
softly
but
a
screech
owl
mocked
him
and
the
night
wind
only
echoed
back
his
voice
emptily
once
he
drew
near
the
house
and
under
the
balcony
where
dawn
had
escaped
he
heard
his
sister
calling
him
charles
charles
mother
wants
you
and
his
heart
grew
bitter
then
betty
s
head
came
out
of
the
window
and
she
called
again
charles
where
are
you
and
dawn
mother
has
been
moaning
and
crying
for
half
an
hour
she
wants
you
and
nothing
else
will
stop
her
but
the
sight
of
you
then
out
of
the
darkness
charles
answered
his
sister
and
the
tone
of
his
voice
frightened
her
betty
i
can
not
come
there
is
something
more
important
than
even
mother
just
now
i
m
sorry
for
mother
but
i
m
afraid
it
s
all
her
fault
she
has
been
saying
things
to
dawn
and
dawn
has
gone
gone
betty
s
horrified
voice
seemed
like
a
fresh
recognition
of
the
awful
truth
that
his
young
wife
was
beyond
his
easy
reach
and
a
dreadful
foreboding
entered
his
soul
oh
charles
betty
gasped
but
she
can
t
be
gone
her
things
are
here
aren
t
they
ll
look
betty
disappeared
and
in
a
moment
more
her
white
scared
face
reappeared
on
the
balcony
and
she
was
holding
a
candle
high
above
her
head
no
they
are
not
there
i
ve
even
looked
in
the
closet
thinking
she
might
have
hung
them
up
her
bonnet
and
mantle
were
on
the
bed
before
supper
but
they
are
gone
from
the
room
i
found
her
gloves
on
the
bed
and
one
on
the
floor
here
they
are
she
tossed
them
to
him
as
if
they
were
an
important
clue
and
charles
caught
at
them
as
if
they
were
something
most
precious
what
shall
we
do
she
asked
hadn
t
i
better
call
father
we
ought
to
find
her
at
once
poor
little
thing
she
ll
be
frightened
out
in
the
night
all
alone
how
could
mother
but
then
she
was
so
upset
with
harrington
i
don
t
believe
she
understood
things
fully
do
you
but
charles
had
no
time
to
listen
to
betty
s
sympathetic
chatter
his
heart
was
wrung
with
the
thought
of
the
girl
he
loved
out
in
the
night
alone
afraid
perhaps
of
the
unknown
perils
about
her
he
must
hurry
to
her
aid
yes
tell
father
to
come
to
the
front
door
quick
there
s
no
time
to
lose
and
betty
don
t
rouse
the
neighbors
let
s
keep
this
quiet
of
course
said
his
little
sister
how
fortunate
they
don
t
know
yet
that
it
was
you
who
was
married
then
betty
flew
to
call
her
father
telling
him
excitedly
all
the
way
to
the
front
door
what
had
happened
poor
child
poor
child
said
the
father
tenderly
as
he
listened
to
the
tale
and
poor
mother
too
she
just
didn
t
understand
charles
made
no
response
he
did
not
feel
like
pitying
his
mother
yet
what
do
you
think
i
had
better
do
father
he
asked
i
ve
gone
everywhere
about
the
place
and
down
the
road
a
good
way
in
each
direction
she
will
have
started
home
i
is
a
girl
s
natural
refuge
said
the
old
man
thoughtfully
there
s
only
one
road
if
you
don
t
take
the
train
she
wouldn
t
likely
go
all
that
way
around
but
father
she
doesn
t
know
the
way
it
was
all
quite
new
to
her
oh
that
s
easy
she
will
ask
and
of
course
anybody
will
direct
her
she
s
probably
asked
somebody
quite
near
the
house
here
if
you
only
knew
whom
you
could
easily
trace
her
but
as
you
say
it
s
best
not
to
say
anything
about
it
for
it
would
get
out
to
the
neighbors
we
ll
soon
trace
her
there
are
only
two
ways
by
which
she
could
reach
the
main
you
go
down
to
the
stable
and
saddle
the
two
sorrel
mares
the
blacks
are
tired
with
the
long
drive
so
you
d
better
take
the
sorrels
the
men
are
all
gone
to
bed
by
this
time
so
you
ll
have
to
do
it
yourself
you
take
one
horse
and
go
the
road
by
the
sawmill
and
i
ll
take
the
other
and
go
around
by
applebee
s
farm
and
then
if
she
should
have
taken
it
into
her
head
to
go
back
by
the
way
you
came
i
couldn
t
miss
her
for
she
couldn
t
have
gone
further
than
that
by
this
time
had
she
any
money
with
her
i
don
t
know
answered
charles
miserably
cheer
up
lad
we
ll
find
her
inside
of
two
hours
never
fear
hurry
up
and
i
ll
be
with
you
in
half
a
minute
five
minutes
later
the
two
horses
and
their
riders
parted
company
at
the
cross
corners
and
started
on
the
search
chapter
xvii
dawn
fled
through
the
dark
grass
straight
from
the
house
not
knowing
or
thinking
where
she
was
going
only
to
get
away
in
a
moment
she
reached
a
high
hedge
of
dense
growth
and
not
daring
more
than
to
glance
toward
the
house
she
crept
swiftly
along
toward
the
street
a
few
rods
from
the
sidewalk
she
found
a
small
opening
and
slipped
through
into
another
great
yard
keeping
close
to
the
hedge
she
soon
reached
the
front
and
slid
out
at
the
gate
like
a
wraith
wondering
what
she
would
do
if
some
one
in
the
neighbor
s
house
should
accost
her
but
no
one
was
near
she
could
hear
footsteps
coming
and
gay
voices
so
she
turned
and
hurried
the
other
way
though
it
carried
her
past
the
house
she
had
just
left
it
would
not
do
she
thought
to
meet
any
one
just
yet
it
was
this
little
circumstance
that
determined
the
direction
of
her
flight
and
carried
her
away
from
the
road
her
kindly
pursuers
expected
her
to
take
she
presently
reached
a
lane
and
turned
into
it
it
happened
to
be
a
private
lane
leading
to
a
set
far
back
from
the
street
and
as
she
approached
the
house
the
deep
bay
of
hounds
heralded
her
coming
her
heart
stood
still
with
fright
for
she
had
read
much
about
the
horror
of
being
pursued
by
bloodhounds
in
those
days
there
was
much
talk
of
the
pursuit
of
escaped
slaves
and
the
girl
s
imagination
suddenly
saw
herself
surrounded
by
a
great
pack
of
hounds
sent
to
bring
her
back
she
paused
and
crouched
beside
the
fence
presently
she
heard
a
man
s
voice
not
far
away
and
saw
a
speck
of
light
moving
and
bobbing
here
and
there
near
the
dark
outline
of
the
house
then
her
senses
came
back
this
was
not
a
dog
sent
after
her
but
a
man
who
had
heard
her
an
intruder
near
the
house
perhaps
he
would
come
and
search
her
out
she
must
get
over
that
fence
as
fast
as
possible
the
silk
skirts
rustled
horribly
and
cold
chills
of
apprehension
crept
down
dawn
s
back
as
she
found
how
much
harder
it
was
to
climb
a
fence
encumbered
by
long
skirts
and
a
bundle
than
when
dressed
as
a
that
gave
her
an
idea
she
ought
to
get
off
that
silk
dress
as
soon
as
possible
for
its
noise
would
attract
attention
another
howl
of
the
dog
startled
her
just
as
she
cleared
the
fence
so
she
began
to
run
fortunately
the
house
was
between
her
and
the
town
and
she
had
not
to
turn
back
upon
her
way
she
discovered
by
the
humps
and
hillocks
that
she
was
in
a
meadow
and
she
struck
out
as
far
away
from
the
house
as
possible
though
the
way
was
rough
and
several
times
she
fell
but
the
dog
s
howling
was
more
distant
now
and
she
concluded
he
had
been
chained
ahead
of
her
she
could
see
a
dark
line
of
trees
and
she
hurried
toward
them
at
least
she
could
pause
there
a
minute
and
arrange
her
clothing
she
crept
within
the
edge
of
the
woods
and
dared
not
look
around
so
easily
her
imagination
could
people
it
with
evil
spirits
she
was
naturally
of
a
courageous
nature
and
at
school
had
always
been
ready
to
dare
anything
just
for
fun
but
it
was
a
different
matter
to
be
running
away
into
the
great
night
world
of
a
place
you
had
never
seen
with
trembling
fingers
she
unfastened
her
bundle
being
careful
to
stick
the
pins
on
the
corner
of
her
handkerchief
in
her
where
she
could
find
them
in
the
dark
it
was
a
work
of
time
and
care
to
extricate
the
little
gray
frock
from
the
bundle
and
be
sure
to
lose
nothing
in
the
darkness
she
unrolled
it
cautiously
gathering
the
other
things
within
the
largest
garment
she
had
brought
and
then
slipped
the
dress
out
from
underneath
first
taking
the
precaution
to
pin
the
smaller
bundle
together
then
she
took
off
her
mantle
slipped
out
of
her
silk
frock
and
into
the
gray
one
all
the
time
nervously
staring
into
the
darkness
of
the
fields
through
which
she
had
just
come
what
if
some
one
should
catch
her
now
the
blood
pounded
through
her
heart
and
poured
up
into
her
face
as
though
it
were
on
a
mad
race
to
strangle
her
her
hair
was
wet
with
perspiration
and
clinging
to
her
forehead
yet
she
felt
a
chill
it
seemed
as
if
her
fingers
were
growing
wooden
and
clumsy
as
she
turned
the
silk
frock
inside
out
and
folded
it
carefully
pinning
it
over
the
other
bundle
so
that
it
would
show
only
a
gray
cotton
lining
the
silk
mantle
she
put
on
again
and
feeling
carefully
about
to
see
that
she
had
left
nothing
behind
she
turned
to
face
the
blackness
of
the
woods
it
was
only
a
maple
sugar
grove
on
the
edge
of
a
prosperous
farm
but
it
looked
inky
black
and
might
have
been
filled
with
all
sorts
of
wild
animals
for
aught
she
knew
yet
she
pressed
on
she
felt
as
if
the
woods
were
a
friend
at
least
she
had
been
used
to
walking
among
the
trees
and
telling
her
troubles
there
to
the
birds
and
breezes
and
now
it
seemed
a
natural
refuge
in
spite
of
its
blackness
if
only
it
were
the
old
woods
she
knew
at
the
school
she
would
not
be
afraid
at
all
but
fear
henceforth
must
have
no
part
in
her
life
she
had
herself
to
look
out
for
and
she
would
never
never
go
again
where
any
one
could
talk
to
her
as
that
dreadful
woman
had
talked
she
shuddered
as
she
remembered
the
cold
cultured
voice
and
the
scorn
that
had
pierced
her
soul
with
a
shame
that
she
knew
was
unjust
her
rising
anger
helped
her
to
go
on
and
put
down
any
timidity
that
she
might
have
felt
and
presently
through
feeling
from
tree
to
tree
she
came
out
to
the
other
side
of
the
maple
grove
far
away
to
the
east
she
could
see
a
pale
moon
rising
she
started
toward
it
keeping
close
to
the
maple
grove
as
if
it
were
a
friend
the
way
led
over
two
or
three
more
meadows
and
now
in
her
little
gray
frock
she
found
it
much
easier
to
climb
the
fences
at
last
she
came
to
a
straight
white
road
in
the
country
with
the
slender
moon
hanging
low
over
it
with
relief
she
climbed
the
intervening
fence
and
took
her
way
along
the
beaten
path
her
light
prunella
slippers
had
found
it
hard
travelling
in
the
meadows
the
day
had
been
a
long
one
and
filled
with
excitement
beginning
with
fear
and
trouble
and
preceded
by
a
sleepless
night
dawn
was
very
weary
now
that
she
felt
herself
safe
from
the
terror
that
possessed
her
yet
she
must
walk
all
night
for
it
would
not
be
safe
to
lie
down
she
knew
she
had
heard
of
wild
beasts
lurking
on
the
edges
of
towns
and
a
wolf
or
a
bear
would
not
be
a
pleasant
companion
on
she
went
through
the
sweet
summer
night
slackening
not
her
pace
even
though
there
was
now
no
longer
need
for
haste
it
seemed
to
her
tired
spirit
that
she
must
go
on
and
on
thus
throughout
ages
always
alone
and
misunderstood
and
pursued
the
thought
of
her
husband
and
their
beautiful
day
together
seemed
like
some
tantalizing
dream
that
hovered
on
her
memory
and
sickened
her
with
its
impossibility
such
joy
as
his
love
offered
her
was
too
great
for
her
ever
to
have
hoped
to
attain
yet
in
her
secret
soul
she
knew
she
was
glad
to
have
had
it
even
if
only
to
have
it
snatched
from
her
as
she
thought
over
her
own
hasty
action
in
leaving
her
husband
s
home
forever
she
could
not
feel
she
had
done
wrong
never
never
could
she
have
lived
with
others
taunting
her
that
she
had
been
married
out
of
that
was
what
his
mother
s
words
had
meant
charles
had
not
married
her
for
love
but
for
pity
because
for
some
unexplained
reason
harrington
had
chosen
to
desert
her
at
the
last
minute
her
exhausted
spirit
did
not
care
to
know
the
reason
she
could
but
be
thankful
that
he
had
anything
anything
was
better
than
to
have
been
married
to
him
all
at
once
a
wild
fear
possessed
her
that
perhaps
by
leaving
the
refuge
of
his
brother
s
home
she
had
again
put
herself
in
danger
of
harrington
perhaps
he
would
find
her
out
follow
her
and
compel
her
to
come
with
him
as
the
night
went
on
all
sorts
of
curious
fancies
took
possession
of
her
excited
brain
until
she
started
at
her
own
shadow
and
thought
some
one
was
following
her
when
all
was
still
in
the
empty
road
behind
once
or
twice
she
sat
down
by
the
roadside
to
rest
but
the
awful
desire
for
sleep
which
crept
over
her
frightened
her
and
she
staggered
to
her
feet
again
the
road
wound
into
a
lonesome
wood
of
tall
forest
trees
so
high
that
the
moon
s
faint
glimmer
served
only
to
make
the
path
look
blacker
but
now
she
was
too
dead
with
weariness
to
have
any
fear
and
she
walked
on
and
on
into
the
blackness
of
the
forest
with
no
care
save
to
keep
going
at
last
under
a
group
of
pines
that
huddled
together
as
if
they
were
of
one
family
she
stumbled
over
a
great
root
that
obtruded
among
the
slippery
pine
needles
and
fell
headlong
she
lay
still
for
a
moment
dazed
and
then
the
sense
of
relief
and
exhaustion
became
so
great
that
without
a
thought
of
wild
beasts
she
drew
her
bundle
up
under
her
head
and
continued
to
lie
still
on
the
soft
sweet
bed
of
needles
the
great
pines
bent
their
feathery
heads
over
her
and
the
wind
crept
into
the
branches
and
softly
sang
a
lullaby
over
the
lonely
little
pilgrim
regardless
of
dangers
that
might
be
stalking
about
her
she
slept
quite
early
in
the
morning
before
the
first
faint
streaks
of
day
had
penetrated
the
cool
retreat
where
dawn
lay
asleep
there
came
a
soft
murmur
of
gentle
music
from
the
trees
all
about
and
soon
a
sleepy
twitter
brightened
and
grew
into
a
chorus
of
melody
bird
answering
to
bird
from
tree
to
tree
up
and
down
and
around
in
and
out
and
over
the
threads
of
song
spun
themselves
into
a
lovely
golden
web
of
harmony
that
seemed
to
shut
the
vaulted
forest
in
loftily
from
all
the
world
and
in
the
midst
of
it
all
dawn
awoke
it
was
quite
gradual
her
return
to
consciousness
as
if
the
atmosphere
of
sweetness
and
melody
pervaded
her
soul
and
stirred
it
from
its
slumber
in
spite
of
itself
bringing
new
life
and
a
great
peace
at
first
she
did
not
open
her
eyes
nor
think
where
she
was
it
was
enough
that
she
smelled
the
pines
and
felt
the
soft
lap
of
nature
where
she
lay
it
seemed
still
very
still
and
restful
cool
and
sweet
and
dark
that
she
knew
with
her
eyes
closed
up
above
where
the
birds
sang
she
seemed
to
feel
a
golden
light
coming
coming
and
knew
that
it
would
soon
grow
into
morning
but
now
she
might
just
allow
herself
this
little
time
to
lie
still
and
listen
and
wait
there
came
to
her
consciousness
a
thrill
of
freedom
that
in
her
fright
and
hurry
the
night
before
she
had
not
realized
for
months
now
she
had
been
to
run
away
from
the
things
that
were
saddening
her
life
and
now
she
had
done
it
she
was
free
free
to
order
her
small
life
for
herself
down
deep
in
her
heart
tugged
the
agony
of
a
great
loss
yet
it
was
as
of
the
loss
of
something
she
had
never
really
dreamed
of
briefly
she
would
not
let
herself
think
of
charles
now
she
wanted
to
keep
his
memory
as
something
sweet
to
take
out
and
look
at
sometimes
when
she
was
lonely
but
that
could
not
be
until
the
first
bitterness
of
the
shame
of
her
union
to
him
was
past
she
wanted
to
forget
the
scene
in
his
mother
s
room
her
terrible
helplessness
before
the
onslaught
of
the
woman
s
tongue
and
just
to
rest
and
feel
that
she
was
free
freedom
meant
getting
away
from
harrington
winthrop
and
from
her
and
from
her
father
s
wrath
or
his
possible
efforts
to
shape
her
life
what
else
it
meant
she
had
yet
to
learn
she
supposed
there
was
some
place
in
the
world
where
she
might
work
for
what
she
needed
the
thought
of
her
livelihood
did
not
trouble
her
youth
feels
equal
to
its
own
support
always
if
it
has
any
spirit
at
all
dawn
had
plenty
of
spirit
and
felt
sure
she
could
earn
her
board
and
keep
at
present
she
was
concerned
only
in
getting
rested
and
getting
away
as
far
as
possible
from
all
the
evil
things
which
seemed
to
have
combined
to
crush
her
the
light
came
on
and
the
morning
entered
the
forest
a
saucy
little
squirrel
ran
up
the
tree
beneath
which
the
girl
lay
and
poised
on
a
high
twig
looked
down
and
chattered
at
her
noisily
down
fell
a
bit
of
bark
upon
dawn
s
face
and
laughing
involuntarily
she
sat
up
and
looked
about
her
the
dim
aisles
of
the
forest
were
lit
with
golden
lights
now
and
the
birds
their
matins
almost
finished
were
hurrying
about
with
breakfast
preparations
a
spilled
his
liquid
notes
out
now
and
then
like
a
silver
spoon
dropped
into
a
glass
a
robin
called
his
mate
and
a
blackbird
whistled
forth
a
silken
melody
dawn
laughed
aloud
again
at
the
squirrel
and
tossed
back
the
curls
that
had
come
loose
from
the
confining
comb
during
her
sleep
it
was
good
just
to
be
here
and
to
be
free
the
squirrel
chattered
back
at
her
and
ran
up
the
tree
dawn
unpinned
her
bundle
and
made
her
simple
toilet
there
was
no
brook
near
where
she
could
wash
her
face
but
perhaps
she
would
come
to
one
by
and
by
she
combed
out
her
hair
as
well
as
she
could
with
only
a
and
did
it
up
on
her
head
for
she
must
have
dignity
now
if
she
were
going
out
in
the
world
to
shift
for
herself
then
she
looked
over
her
small
possessions
carefully
as
a
shipwrecked
mariner
might
take
account
of
the
wreckage
he
had
saved
she
took
a
kind
of
fierce
joy
in
the
thought
that
she
had
brought
none
of
the
elaborate
garments
which
her
had
prepared
for
her
trousseau
they
were
all
the
simple
school
garments
that
had
been
put
at
the
bottom
of
her
trunk
she
rolled
up
the
bundle
again
and
pinned
it
closely
then
tied
her
bonnet
on
demurely
straightened
her
frock
and
was
ready
for
the
day
a
soft
little
pathway
of
light
beckoned
her
through
the
woods
and
she
followed
it
her
bundle
tucked
under
her
cape
her
with
its
cords
safely
twisted
about
her
wrist
the
bar
of
light
grew
brighter
and
broader
and
led
her
to
another
road
unwittingly
she
had
come
a
way
that
would
take
her
far
from
the
place
where
she
started
more
directly
than
any
other
she
could
have
chosen
the
sight
of
the
white
road
in
the
dewy
morning
light
gave
her
new
zest
for
her
journey
her
sleep
short
though
it
had
been
had
rested
her
wonderfully
and
she
was
eager
to
get
on
her
way
she
climbed
the
fence
and
fairly
flew
down
the
road
it
was
very
early
and
she
would
be
far
on
her
way
before
people
were
up
and
stirring
there
were
on
this
road
and
sometimes
at
that
meant
that
a
came
that
way
she
studied
the
next
carefully
and
decided
that
she
was
on
the
direct
route
to
new
york
and
that
the
miles
might
mean
from
new
york
to
somewhere
else
not
albany
of
course
for
she
must
be
far
to
the
west
of
that
perhaps
she
would
find
out
later
as
she
went
on
what
if
she
should
go
as
far
as
new
york
how
long
would
it
take
her
she
could
not
go
all
at
once
probably
but
gradually
she
might
work
her
way
down
why
not
the
world
was
before
her
she
would
watch
the
and
see
how
long
it
took
her
to
go
a
mile
thus
dreaming
she
flew
along
like
a
bird
here
and
there
she
passed
a
farm
and
soon
she
began
to
see
signs
of
life
about
the
men
were
coming
from
the
barns
with
brimming
pails
of
milk
as
she
passed
one
house
somewhat
nearer
to
the
road
than
the
rest
she
caught
the
fragrance
of
frying
ham
and
the
aroma
of
coffee
it
made
her
hungry
a
mile
further
she
came
to
a
small
white
house
not
far
from
the
roadside
outside
the
door
a
woman
who
wore
a
sunbonnet
and
a
big
apron
sat
on
a
stool
milking
a
mild
old
cow
as
dawn
came
near
the
woman
gave
the
last
scientific
squeeze
and
moved
the
pail
from
its
position
under
the
cow
then
taking
the
stool
in
one
hand
and
the
pail
in
the
other
started
for
the
house
the
face
she
showed
beneath
the
deep
sunbonnet
was
a
kindly
one
following
an
impulse
dawn
turned
in
at
the
front
gate
and
the
old
woman
paused
to
see
what
she
wanted
could
you
let
me
have
a
glass
of
milk
dawn
s
voice
was
sweet
and
she
held
her
purse
in
her
hand
i
would
be
glad
to
pay
for
it
i
started
early
this
morning
and
am
hungry
i
m
on
my
way
to
the
next
village
the
woman
s
face
lit
up
at
the
sight
of
the
girl
s
smile
a
glass
of
milk
she
said
course
i
can
but
i
don
t
want
no
pay
for
it
just
you
keep
your
pennies
for
a
new
ribbon
to
wear
under
that
pretty
chin
set
down
under
the
tree
there
on
the
bench
an
i
ll
bring
a
cup
she
put
down
her
pail
on
a
large
flat
stone
and
hurried
in
coming
out
in
a
moment
with
a
plate
of
steaming
and
a
flowered
cup
of
delicate
china
the
woman
strained
the
milk
into
the
cup
and
stood
watching
her
while
she
ate
the
delicious
breakfast
come
fur
asked
the
hostess
eying
the
sweet
young
tramp
appreciatively
from
beyond
schoharie
she
answered
quickly
remembering
the
name
on
the
last
signboard
she
had
passed
h
m
right
smart
way
fer
a
little
slip
of
a
thing
like
you
to
come
alone
you
must
a
started
fore
light
soon
after
laughed
dawn
she
felt
as
if
she
were
playing
a
game
then
perceiving
that
the
old
lady
was
curious
and
would
ask
questions
that
she
did
not
care
to
answer
she
launched
into
a
description
of
the
morning
sky
and
the
early
bird
songs
the
old
woman
watched
her
as
if
she
were
drinking
in
a
picture
that
did
her
good
bless
me
she
said
that
sounds
like
poetry
verses
how
do
you
think
it
up
then
she
whisked
into
the
house
again
and
came
out
with
a
paper
of
doughnuts
you
might
get
hungry
again
fore
you
get
to
the
village
and
these
doughnuts
was
extra
good
this
time
just

time
as

hungry
when
you

much
for
your
kind
invitation
and
i

the
doughnuts
i
love
doughnuts
we
used
to
have
them
in
school
once
a
week
in
the
winter
but
only
one
apiece
so
you
ve
been
to
boardin
the
old
woman
would
fain
have
detained
her
but
dawn
edged
away
toward
the
gate
thanking
her
sweetly
all
the
while
and
saying
she
must
hasten
for
the
sun
was
getting
high
she
hurried
down
the
road
at
last
pretending
not
to
hear
the
old
woman
s
question
about
who
were
her
friends
in
schoharie
and
where
she
was
going
to
visit
in
the
village
her
cheeks
were
bright
with
the
excitement
of
the
little
episode
and
she
trilled
a
gay
song
as
she
fled
on
her
unknown
way
for
the
time
being
all
sadness
was
put
away
and
she
was
gay
and
free
as
a
lark
just
a
happy
child
a
farmer
s
boy
on
a
crawling
along
to
the
village
stopped
his
whistling
and
stared
at
her
and
the
hired
man
on
top
of
the
load
called
out
to
him
some
remark
about
her
that
made
the
color
grow
brighter
in
her
cheeks
and
her
heart
flutter
wildly
in
her
breast
she
could
not
hear
what
words
the
man
had
spoken
but
his
tone
had
been
contemptuous
and
familiar
she
fairly
flew
by
the
team
and
fled
on
down
the
road
by
noon
the
and
milk
were
dreams
of
the
past
and
she
was
exceedingly
hungry
yet
she
had
not
come
to
a
place
where
she
cared
to
ask
for
dinner
every
she
came
to
seemed
to
have
plenty
of
farmhands
about
coming
in
to
their
dinner
and
she
dreaded
their
eyes
upon
her
so
she
sat
down
under
a
tree
by
the
roadside
and
ate
her
fat
sugary
doughnuts
rested
a
few
minutes
and
plodded
on
the
afternoon
was
more
wearisome
her
slippers
hurt
her
feet
and
she
had
to
stop
often
to
rest
about
five
o
clock
she
came
to
a
inn
by
the
roadside
where
a
decent
woman
sat
knitting
by
the
door
and
dawn
decided
to
sacrifice
something
from
her
small
store
of
money
and
stop
overnight
the
woman
eyed
her
curiously
when
she
asked
for
a
room
and
supper
not
many
pilgrims
so
young
or
so
beautiful
passed
her
way
unattended
dawn
explained
that
she
was
on
her
way
to
another
town
to
look
for
something
to
do
i
suppose
you
re
expecting
to
teach
school
said
the
woman
disapprovingly
they
all
do
nowadays
when
they
better
be
home
helping
their
mothers
make
bread
and
pies
my
mother
is
dead
said
dawn
quietly
and
i
must
earn
my
own
living
now
the
woman
was
silenced
and
gave
the
young
traveller
a
pleasant
little
whitewashed
room
where
she
slept
soundly
but
an
idea
had
come
to
her
a
teacher
of
course
she
could
be
a
teacher
had
she
not
led
her
classes
and
always
been
successful
in
showing
the
girls
at
school
how
to
do
their
sums
she
would
enjoy
playing
the
part
of
friend
ruth
and
putting
a
class
through
its
paces
it
quite
interested
her
to
think
how
she
would
do
it
but
how
would
she
get
her
school
should
she
go
to
new
york
and
try
or
begin
in
a
country
one
first
this
thought
interested
her
all
through
the
day
which
was
saturday
and
kept
away
the
undertone
of
consciousness
of
a
deep
loss
but
once
toward
evening
she
passed
a
shiny
new
carryall
in
which
rode
a
young
man
and
a
girl
and
a
sharp
pang
shot
through
her
heart
as
it
brought
back
vividly
to
her
memory
the
beautiful
day
which
she
and
charles
had
spent
together
and
then
her
mind
went
back
to
the
first
time
she
had
seen
him
that
day
when
she
was
standing
on
the
hilltop
with
her
small
audience
before
her
and
had
looked
up
and
seen
the
shining
of
his
eyes
it
came
to
her
then
that
she
had
a
certain
right
of
possession
in
him
as
if
that
day
had
given
her
to
him
and
him
to
her
in
a
bond
that
could
never
be
broken
no
matter
how
far
they
might
be
separated
quiet
joy
settled
down
upon
her
with
the
thought
that
whatever
might
come
whether
she
ever
saw
him
again
or
not
she
was
his
wife
and
nobody
nobody
could
ever
take
the
thought
of
it
from
her
the
sun
was
setting
and
evening
bells
were
ringing
in
the
spire
of
a
little
white
church
as
she
came
into
a
small
village
nestled
at
the
foot
of
a
circle
of
hills
it
reminded
her
that
the
next
day
was
the
sabbath
that
day
had
no
sweet
association
for
her
since
her
mother
s
death
but
though
she
had
been
only
a
little
child
she
could
remember
walking
by
her
mother
s
side
to
church
with
her
little
starched
skirts
swinging
and
her
mitted
hands
folded
demurely
over
her
pocket
handkerchief
while
the
bells
rang
a
cheery
call
to
prayer
there
had
been
no
bells
on
the
to
which
the
scholars
of
friend
ruth
s
school
were
taken
every
first
day
and
nothing
about
the
service
to
remind
her
of
the
church
where
she
had
sat
by
her
mother
s
side
in
the
pew
and
heard
the
hymns
lined
out
trying
to
follow
the
singing
of
the
congregation
with
her
wee
sweet
voice
but
now
the
bells
harked
back
over
the
years
and
brought
an
aching
memory
of
her
almost
forgotten
little
girlhood
a
sudden
longing
to
go
to
church
as
she
used
to
do
came
over
her
and
she
decided
to
find
a
place
in
the
village
to
stay
over
sunday
and
go
to
service
in
the
little
church
besides
it
was
against
the
law
in
those
days
for
any
one
to
travel
unnecessarily
on
the
sabbath
day
dawn
never
thought
of
doing
so
any
more
than
she
would
have
contemplated
the
possibility
of
stealing
it
chanced
that
she
arrived
at
the
village
tavern
about
the
same
time
as
the
from
the
opposite
direction
and
no
one
noticed
that
she
had
not
come
on
the
stage
for
there
were
a
number
of
travellers
who
stopped
off
here
for
the
sabbath
seeing
them
descending
from
the
coach
she
went
in
haste
to
the
landlady
and
begged
that
she
might
have
a
tiny
room
to
herself
she
was
a
little
frightened
at
the
thought
of
paying
a
whole
dollar
out
of
her
small
hoard
for
the
lodging
and
her
meals
until
after
breakfast
monday
morning
but
she
shut
her
eyes
to
the
thought
of
it
and
took
the
room
it
was
only
a
tiny
one
over
a
shed
that
was
given
her
but
everything
was
clean
and
sweet
and
the
supper
smells
came
richly
up
through
the
open
window
to
her
hungry
senses
on
the
whole
she
was
quite
content
when
she
lay
down
to
rest
in
her
own
little
room
that
night
and
dreamed
of
and
weddings
and
sweet
fields
of
clover
and
hay
chapter
xviii
the
next
morning
the
roosters
crowing
under
her
window
awakened
her
and
for
the
moment
she
thought
she
was
back
in
school
with
the
not
far
away
but
other
and
unfamiliar
sounds
and
odors
brought
her
back
to
realities
and
she
remembered
she
was
a
lone
traveller
putting
up
at
an
inn
she
lay
still
for
some
time
thinking
over
the
strangeness
of
it
all
and
the
tragic
happenings
of
the
last
few
days
the
thought
of
charles
brought
tears
to
her
eyes
the
dearness
and
loss
of
him
came
over
her
as
it
had
not
had
time
to
do
while
she
was
hurrying
on
her
way
but
this
morning
for
the
first
time
she
felt
that
she
was
far
from
every
one
who
knew
her
and
hidden
securely
so
that
she
could
never
be
found
and
that
she
might
look
her
life
in
the
face
and
know
what
it
all
meant
it
was
inevitable
that
in
reviewing
her
life
the
first
and
largest
part
of
all
should
be
charles
and
her
brief
but
sweet
acquaintance
with
him
that
she
was
his
wife
thrilled
her
with
unspeakable
joy
the
fact
that
she
had
deliberately
renounced
him
took
away
to
some
extent
the
sting
of
the
manner
in
which
she
had
been
married
as
she
thought
it
all
over
she
realized
that
the
only
real
shame
in
the
whole
affair
was
that
she
had
been
about
to
marry
harrington
winthrop
when
her
heart
was
full
of
fear
and
hatred
for
him
she
seemed
to
see
many
things
in
a
new
light
in
fact
the
child
had
become
a
woman
in
the
space
of
a
few
days
and
she
understood
life
better
though
it
was
still
one
vast
perplexity
one
thing
remained
of
all
the
past
and
that
was
the
memory
of
the
love
of
charles
even
the
remembrance
of
her
dear
mother
was
dimmed
by
it
it
seemed
to
be
the
one
eternal
fact
which
stood
out
clearly
and
in
the
light
of
which
she
must
hereafter
live
that
he
had
been
generous
and
kind
enough
to
marry
her
for
the
sake
of
relieving
her
from
humiliation
as
his
mother
had
intimated
only
made
dawn
love
him
the
more
but
because
of
the
generosity
of
that
act
she
must
never
trouble
him
again
she
had
renounced
him
it
was
the
least
she
could
do
for
him
under
the
circumstances
in
return
for
his
great
kindness
but
whatever
happened
she
must
be
true
to
his
memory
and
be
such
that
he
would
always
be
proud
of
her
if
he
should
chance
ever
to
hear
of
her
though
she
meant
to
take
care
that
he
did
not
if
she
had
been
a
little
older
and
wiser
if
she
had
understood
the
ways
of
the
world
better
she
would
not
have
been
so
sure
that
she
was
taking
the
most
direct
way
to
reward
charles
for
his
kindness
to
her
but
she
did
not
understand
and
so
was
sincere
and
earnest
in
her
mistaken
way
of
being
loyal
to
him
one
thing
however
made
her
glad
she
felt
that
no
matter
how
far
apart
they
might
be
during
the
rest
of
their
lives
they
had
understood
each
other
and
their
souls
had
met
in
a
deep
sweet
joy
as
she
thought
of
the
moment
before
supper
at
his
home
when
he
had
held
her
in
that
close
embrace
and
laid
his
face
upon
hers
and
kissed
her
the
sweetness
and
pain
of
it
were
too
much
for
her
and
with
a
sharp
cry
she
hid
her
face
in
her
pillow
and
wept
bitterly
it
never
occurred
to
her
poor
little
pilgrim
that
he
might
be
grieving
just
as
deeply
over
her
absence
and
the
mystery
of
her
whereabouts
as
was
she
for
him
or
she
would
have
flown
to
him
in
spite
of
all
and
made
him
glad
the
tempest
of
her
grief
swept
over
her
like
a
summer
storm
and
was
gone
at
her
age
she
could
not
grieve
long
over
what
had
been
hers
so
briefly
that
it
had
scarcely
become
tangible
but
as
it
had
been
the
dearest
happening
of
her
life
and
the
only
bright
thing
in
her
girlhood
it
took
the
form
of
a
mount
of
vision
from
which
ever
after
she
was
to
draw
her
inspiration
for
the
doing
of
the
monotonous
tasks
of
life
she
arose
and
washed
away
the
marks
of
the
tears
and
dressed
herself
carefully
in
her
green
silk
for
church
arranging
her
hair
demurely
on
the
top
of
her
head
with
the
curls
as
little
in
evidence
as
possible
she
wished
to
look
old
and
dignified
as
befitted
a
person
travelling
by
herself
and
looking
for
a
chance
to
teach
school
the
village
was
a
pretty
one
and
as
she
walked
down
the
street
to
the
church
her
heart
went
out
to
it
as
she
sat
in
the
tall
pew
where
the
beadle
placed
her
she
glanced
shyly
around
at
the
people
who
came
in
and
wished
she
might
stop
here
and
get
something
to
do
yet
her
heart
shrank
from
any
attempt
to
speak
to
them
or
beg
their
help
a
lady
came
in
leading
a
little
girl
by
the
hand
a
child
with
a
chubby
face
and
ringlets
in
clusters
on
either
cheek
held
there
by
her
fine
white
dunstable
straw
bonnet
with
its
and
of
soft
lace
after
they
were
seated
across
the
aisle
the
little
girl
leaned
over
her
mother
and
stared
at
dawn
then
smiled
shyly
and
the
young
wanderer
felt
that
she
had
one
friend
in
this
strange
place
a
sudden
loneliness
gripped
her
heart
and
she
wished
she
were
a
little
girl
again
sitting
by
her
mother
s
side
how
many
many
times
she
had
wished
that
the
last
few
months
the
thought
made
her
heart
ache
it
was
so
old
a
hurt
she
felt
the
smart
of
tears
that
wanted
to
swim
out
and
blind
her
vision
but
she
straightened
up
and
tried
to
look
dignified
remembering
that
she
was
a
woman
married
woman
she
wondered
would
it
be
wrong
to
pretend
as
she
used
to
do
at
school
sometimes
she
wanted
to
pretend
that
charles
sat
by
her
side
they
two
going
to
their
first
church
service
together
she
decided
there
would
be
no
harm
in
that
and
moved
a
little
nearer
the
corner
to
make
room
for
her
dear
companion
it
gave
her
a
happy
sense
of
not
being
alone
and
she
glanced
up
now
and
then
as
if
he
were
there
and
she
were
watching
him
proudly
it
was
not
hard
to
imagine
him
she
was
good
at
such
things
it
thrilled
her
to
think
how
his
arm
would
be
close
to
hers
his
sleeve
touching
her
hand
perhaps
as
he
held
the
for
her
to
sing
with
him
and
to
think
that
if
only
her
marriage
had
been
like
others
she
would
in
all
probability
have
been
singing
beside
him
in
his
home
church
at
this
very
minute
the
thought
of
it
almost
brought
the
tears
there
were
no
in
the
little
village
church
but
the
minister
lined
the
hymn
out
and
dawn
stood
up
to
sing
with
the
rest
her
clear
voice
lifting
the
tune
till
people
near
her
turned
to
look
at
the
sweet
face
she
tried
to
think
that
charles
was
singing
by
her
side
but
when
they
came
to
the
stanza
when
we
asunder
part
it
gives
us
inward
pain
but
we
shall
still
be
joined
in
heart
and
hope
to
meet
again
it
was
almost
too
much
for
her
and
she
had
to
wink
hard
to
keep
back
the
tears
for
it
came
over
her
that
she
could
not
hope
to
meet
charles
again
but
must
go
on
with
the
being
asunder
always
the
minister
had
gray
hair
and
a
kindly
face
he
preached
about
comfort
and
dawn
felt
as
if
it
were
meant
for
her
as
she
listened
an
idea
came
to
her
she
would
go
to
the
minister
and
ask
him
to
help
her
find
a
school
ministers
knew
about
such
things
she
went
to
the
afternoon
service
also
and
after
it
was
over
two
or
three
women
shook
hands
with
her
looked
curiously
admiringly
at
her
rich
silk
gown
and
asked
her
if
she
were
a
stranger
she
smiled
and
nodded
shyly
then
the
minister
came
and
shook
hands
with
her
and
brought
his
wife
to
speak
to
her
she
watched
them
go
across
the
churchyard
together
and
up
the
steps
of
the
old
parsonage
the
minister
seemed
tired
too
but
there
was
sympathy
between
the
two
that
seemed
to
rest
them
both
when
they
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
it
touched
the
here
were
two
who
had
walked
together
yet
who
seemed
to
be
agreed
and
to
be
happy
in
each
other
s
company
she
felt
instinctively
from
the
minister
s
face
that
he
would
not
have
sent
his
wife
away
from
his
home
no
matter
what
she
had
done
he
would
not
have
thought
she
had
done
anything
wrong
in
the
first
place
it
came
to
dawn
that
perhaps
it
had
been
her
father
s
quick
temper
and
hasty
judgment
that
had
made
all
the
trouble
for
her
mother
she
remembered
lately
an
unutterably
sad
expression
about
his
eyes
perhaps
he
was
feeling
sorry
about
it
and
ashamed
it
made
the
girl
have
a
tenderer
feeling
for
the
father
she
had
never
really
loved
she
pitied
him
that
he
must
live
with
her
she
had
not
as
yet
connected
van
rensselaer
with
her
own
present
predicament
her
main
sensations
were
dislike
for
her
father
s
second
wife
and
thankfulness
that
she
was
out
of
her
jurisdiction
it
remained
for
deeper
reflection
to
tell
dawn
just
how
much
her
was
to
blame
for
her
having
been
married
to
one
man
supposing
all
the
time
that
he
was
another
the
next
morning
quite
early
dawn
attired
herself
in
her
little
gray
frock
and
tied
her
bonnet
neatly
then
leaving
her
bundle
in
her
room
ready
to
move
in
case
her
mission
failed
she
presented
herself
at
the
parsonage
and
asked
to
see
the
minister
she
was
shown
into
the
study
where
the
good
man
sat
in
a
big
chair
by
the
open
window
reading
he
received
her
kindly
and
gave
her
a
chair
i
ve
come
to
gee
whether
you
can
help
me
to
find
something
to
do
she
began
shyly
my
mother
is
dead
and
i
must
earn
my
own
living
i
have
relatives
to
whom
i
should
be
a
burden
and
i
have
come
away
so
that
they
will
not
be
troubled
with
me
she
had
thought
out
during
the
night
watches
just
what
to
say
the
minister
looked
at
her
keenly
and
kindly
through
his
spectacles
long
experience
had
made
him
a
good
judge
of
character
he
saw
nothing
but
guileless
innocence
in
the
sweet
young
face
what
is
your
name
he
asked
by
way
of
preliminary
dawn
s
face
flushed
slightly
but
she
had
anticipated
this
question
i
should
like
to
be
called
mary
montgomery
she
said
shyly
it
is
not
my
real
name
but
my
relatives
might
be
mortified
if
they
should
hear
of
my
being
at
work
they
are
very
proud
and
would
not
like
to
have
their
name
mixed
up
with
one
who
works
besides
if
they
should
hear
of
my
being
here
this
way
they
would
think
that
they
must
come
after
me
and
take
care
of
me
and
i
don
t
wish
them
to
i
want
to
be
independent
she
gave
the
minister
a
most
engaging
smile
which
put
a
well
rounded
period
to
her
plea
how
do
i
know
that
you
have
not
run
away
he
asked
her
half
smiling
himself
oh
i
have
run
away
answered
dawn
frankly
i
knew
they
would
try
to
keep
me
if
i
told
them
but
i
left
word
i
had
gone
and
they
will
not
worry
they
do
not
love
me
they
wanted
me
to
stay
only
because
they
felt
it
a
duty
to
care
for
me
and
they
will
be
greatly
relieved
to
be
rid
of
me
without
any
trouble
that
is
why
i
came
you
see
they
told
me
as
much
and
it
was
very
uncomfortable
you
would
not
want
to
stay
where
you
knew
you
were
in
the
way
would
you
dawn
looked
into
the
old
minister
s
eyes
with
her
own
wide
lovely
ones
and
won
his
heart
she
reminded
him
of
his
little
girl
who
had
died
i
suppose
not
he
said
in
a
half
amused
tone
but
don
t
you
think
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
confide
in
me
just
tell
me
your
real
name
and
where
you
come
from
and
all
about
it
and
then
i
can
help
you
better
i
shall
be
able
to
recommend
you
you
know
thank
you
no
said
dawn
decidedly
getting
up
as
if
that
ended
the
matter
if
i
told
you
that
and
then
you
were
asked
if
i
were
here
you
would
have
to
say
yes
then
too
if
you
knew
you
might
think
it
was
your
duty
to
let
my
friends
know
where
i
am
now
you
have
no
responsibility
about
it
at
all
don
t
you
see
but
i
don
t
want
to
make
you
any
trouble
if
you
don
t
know
of
some
work
i
might
do
here
i
will
go
elsewhere
i
can
surely
find
something
to
do
without
telling
my
real
name
i
know
i
am
doing
right
you
were
so
kind
when
you
spoke
to
me
yesterday
that
i
thought
i
would
come
and
ask
though
i
had
intended
going
on
this
morning
wait
said
the
minister
sit
down
what
do
you
want
to
do
what
kind
of
work
are
you
fitted
for
i
have
been
educated
at
a
good
school
said
dawn
sitting
down
and
putting
on
a
quaint
little
air
which
made
the
minister
smile
did
you
ever
teach
school
there
was
much
hesitation
in
the
minister
s
voice
he
was
not
altogether
sure
he
was
doing
right
to
suggest
the
idea
she
was
such
a
child
in
looks
no
but
i
could
replied
dawn
confidently
and
oh
i
should
like
it
it
is
just
what
i
want
i
love
to
show
people
how
to
do
things
and
make
them
learn
correctly
i
used
to
help
the
girls
at
school
there
was
great
eagerness
in
her
face
the
minister
thought
how
lovely
she
was
and
again
that
fleeting
likeness
to
his
dead
child
gripped
his
heart
you
are
very
young
he
mused
watching
the
changing
expression
on
her
face
and
thinking
that
his
child
would
have
been
about
this
girl
s
age
i
am
almost
seventeen
said
dawn
drawing
herself
up
gravely
our
village
schoolmaster
left
very
suddenly
last
week
to
go
to
his
invalid
mother
s
bedside
and
it
may
be
some
months
before
his
return
indeed
it
is
possible
that
he
will
not
come
back
at
all
he
intimated
as
much
before
he
left
we
have
not
had
opportunity
as
yet
to
find
another
teacher
and
the
school
has
been
dismissed
for
a
few
days
until
we
can
look
about
for
a
substitute
oh
will
you
let
me
try
dawn
sat
on
the
edge
of
her
chair
her
hands
clasped
her
lovely
eyes
pleading
eagerly
but
some
of
the
scholars
are
larger
than
you
are
that
will
not
matter
responded
dawn
undaunted
i
could
always
make
the
girls
at
school
do
what
i
wanted
there
are
some
big
boys
who
might
make
you
a
good
deal
of
trouble
went
on
the
minister
our
school
has
the
name
of
being
a
hard
one
to
discipline
we
have
always
had
a
man
at
its
head
i
am
not
afraid
said
dawn
fire
in
her
eyes
i
should
like
to
try
if
you
will
let
me
you
can
not
tell
whether
i
can
do
it
unless
you
let
me
try
that
is
true
agreed
the
minister
gravely
i
suppose
there
would
be
no
harm
in
your
trying
i
could
talk
with
the
trustees
about
it
though
the
matter
has
been
practically
left
to
me
oh
then
please
try
me
i
am
sure
i
can
do
it
dawn
pleaded
and
the
look
of
his
dead
child
s
eyes
in
her
face
conquered
the
minister
s
scruples
very
well
i
will
try
you
he
said
after
a
thoughtful
pause
i
will
see
the
trustees
and
have
the
notices
put
up
at
once
school
will
open
morning
but
i
warn
you
it
will
be
no
easy
task
i
feel
that
it
will
be
an
extremely
doubtful
experiment
oh
thank
you
cried
dawn
her
eyes
bright
with
anticipation
i
am
not
afraid
and
i
shall
do
my
best
i
am
sure
i
can
teach
a
school
poor
child
thought
the
minister
am
i
doing
right
to
send
her
into
such
a
trial
aloud
he
only
said
you
will
receive
sixteen
dollars
a
month
and
will
board
around
miss
montgomery
dawn
looked
up
at
the
new
name
she
had
chosen
and
saw
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
she
smiled
in
recognition
of
his
acceptance
of
it
where
are
you
stopping
he
asked
i
am
at
the
golden
swan
she
answered
i
can
stay
there
a
little
while
yet
i
have
a
little
money
though
it
will
not
last
many
weeks
she
wrinkled
her
sweet
face
into
dimples
and
smiled
at
him
as
if
having
no
money
were
a
matter
of
little
consequence
he
admired
her
courage
and
bending
upon
her
a
look
of
benediction
said
kindly
we
will
arrange
the
matter
of
boarding
as
soon
as
possible
i
will
see
gillette
the
wife
of
the
proprietor
of
the
golden
swan
they
have
a
daughter
in
school
and
possibly
their
two
boys
will
attend
also
though
sometimes
at
this
time
of
year
they
are
both
out
working
on
the
farm
but
the
gillettes
always
take
the
teacher
for
their
share
of
the
term
dawn
went
smiling
down
the
parsonage
path
it
seemed
to
her
the
larkspurs
had
grown
bluer
and
the
verbenas
pinker
since
she
came
up
a
few
minutes
before
and
her
feet
fairly
danced
down
the
street
she
was
so
happy
over
her
good
fortune
it
was
like
a
beautiful
story
the
way
it
was
turning
out
she
had
no
apprehensions
about
her
ability
to
handle
the
village
school
for
she
had
had
no
experience
of
what
bad
boys
could
be
so
there
was
nothing
to
cloud
her
bright
day
save
now
and
then
a
brief
pang
of
longing
for
charles
for
the
most
part
her
mind
was
too
much
filled
with
anticipation
of
the
morrow
to
have
room
for
thoughts
of
the
past
she
went
to
the
golden
swan
and
told
gillette
that
she
was
to
remain
there
for
a
few
days
at
least
then
she
found
the
village
store
and
made
a
few
simple
purchases
among
them
needles
thread
and
a
thimble
then
she
chose
material
for
an
apron
and
hurried
home
to
make
it
the
she
had
known
had
always
worn
aprons
they
were
a
badge
of
office
but
the
apron
she
made
was
not
like
friend
ruth
s
it
was
small
and
coquettish
and
edged
with
a
tiny
ruffle
dawn
knew
how
to
sew
beautifully
for
that
had
been
one
of
the
accomplishments
friend
ruth
required
of
all
her
pupils
with
a
pair
of
borrowed
scissors
the
young
girl
fashioned
the
garment
and
cut
the
tiny
ruffles
rolling
the
hems
as
she
had
been
taught
to
do
and
scratching
the
gathers
scientifically
by
night
she
had
a
dainty
little
apron
ready
to
wear
to
school
it
was
a
frivolous
bit
of
a
thing
but
it
filled
her
with
delight
for
it
was
such
an
apron
as
she
had
always
desired
but
had
not
been
allowed
to
have
while
in
school
simplicity
held
sway
where
friend
ruth
ruled
at
the
supper
table
it
was
whispered
around
that
a
new
had
come
to
town
there
were
notices
up
at
the
corners
and
all
the
school
was
to
take
up
on
the
morrow
some
of
the
people
at
the
table
looked
suspiciously
at
the
pretty
young
stranger
sitting
demurely
by
herself
at
the
end
of
the
table
and
wondered
if
she
were
the
new
teacher
but
others
said
no
she
was
entirely
too
young
after
supper
dawn
went
to
the
big
book
wherein
were
registered
the
names
of
the
guests
and
wrote
down
mary
montgomery
in
a
clear
round
hand
gillette
watched
her
carefully
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
as
he
saw
her
about
to
turn
away
he
said
gruffly
put
down
the
place
we
like
to
know
where
our
folks
belongs
oh
said
dawn
a
pink
flush
stealing
into
her
cheek
what
should
she
put
then
quick
as
a
flash
she
thought
i
have
adopted
a
should
i
not
adopt
a
home
too
i
am
on
my
way
to
new
york
if
i
do
not
remain
here
i
shall
go
i
can
get
there
i
will
choose
new
york
for
my
home
it
is
a
large
place
and
no
one
will
expect
me
to
know
every
one
there
besides
it
will
also
stand
for
new
york
state
so
without
another
word
she
wrote
new
york
beside
her
name
she
might
as
well
have
written
heaven
for
it
stood
to
her
as
a
kind
of
final
destination
far
away
and
pleasant
the
only
place
now
that
she
could
look
to
for
a
real
home
you
ain
t
the
new
schoolmarm
be
you
inquired
the
worthy
proprietor
of
the
golden
swan
cautiously
why
yes
said
dawn
happily
conscious
and
laughing
merrily
to
think
of
the
word
schoolmarm
as
applied
to
her
who
but
yesterday
was
a
scholar
now
you
don
t
say
said
the
proprietor
settling
back
in
his
chair
and
putting
his
feet
on
the
office
table
in
front
of
him
while
he
shoved
up
his
spectacles
to
get
a
better
view
of
her
some
said
as
how
you
was
but
i
couldn
t
think
it
you
look
so
young
oh
i
m
quite
old
said
dawn
anxiously
i
m
far
older
than
i
look
and
she
hurried
away
lest
she
should
be
questioned
further
it
was
soon
noised
abroad
that
the
new
teacher
was
stopping
at
the
golden
swan
and
many
a
villager
dropped
in
to
have
a
look
at
her
but
she
was
nowhere
in
evidence
up
in
the
little
whitewashed
chamber
with
her
candle
lighted
and
the
shades
drawn
she
was
standing
before
her
tiny
arrayed
in
her
new
beruffled
apron
and
trying
to
look
grave
and
dignified
and
as
much
like
friend
ruth
as
possible
if
charles
could
have
seen
her
all
absorbed
his
heart
would
have
been
sadly
cast
down
to
see
how
little
she
seemed
to
miss
him
but
later
when
she
had
put
out
her
candle
and
crept
into
her
bed
she
sobbed
a
long
time
into
her
pillow
with
loneliness
and
excitement
chapter
xix
there
was
much
curiosity
in
the
village
concerning
the
new
teacher
who
was
reported
to
have
come
from
new
york
and
to
be
exceedingly
young
some
thought
the
minister
had
made
a
great
mistake
to
hire
a
woman
for
the
school
was
a
hard
one
to
manage
and
even
a
master
found
it
difficult
to
control
the
big
boys
there
was
so
much
talk
about
it
that
the
scholars
themselves
were
quite
excited
even
the
big
boys
who
usually
preferred
to
get
out
of
the
summer
session
although
it
meant
hard
work
in
the
hayfields
decided
to
go
to
school
and
see
for
themselves
quite
early
the
scholars
might
have
been
seen
wending
their
way
toward
the
old
red
they
huddled
in
groups
about
the
steps
or
under
the
great
elm
tree
which
grew
in
front
and
spread
its
branches
far
on
every
side
making
a
lovely
leafy
bower
for
the
playground
peggy
gillette
was
among
the
first
to
arrive
from
her
point
of
vantage
at
the
golden
swan
she
was
in
a
position
to
give
accurate
information
concerning
the
new
teacher
so
she
knew
that
she
would
be
most
popular
this
morning
she
had
therefore
packed
her
little
hastily
and
departed
soon
after
breakfast
after
making
sure
that
dawn
had
gone
up
to
her
room
to
make
ready
for
school
she
s
awful
pretty
peggy
told
the
first
knot
of
eager
listeners
and
she
s
got
a
lot
of
real
curls
on
top
what
ain
t
tied
on
i
know
fer
i
peeked
through
the
crack
of
the
door
when
she
was
fixin
her
hair
last
night
and
it
was
down
and
reached
ever
so
far
below
her
waist
an
she
s
got
dimples
when
she
laughs
and
twinkles
in
her
eyes
like
the
stars
make
an
she
ain
t
much
bigger
n
i
am
she
looks
just
like
a
little
girl
h
m
we
ll
soon
do
her
up
remarked
daniel
butterworth
the
tallest
and
strongest
boy
in
the
school
daniel
had
a
shock
of
yellow
hair
that
was
roughly
curly
big
blue
eyes
with
curly
yellow
lashes
and
an
irresponsible
wide
mouth
always
on
a
defiant
grin
peggy
looked
up
at
him
in
terror
now
dan
butterworth
she
began
ef
you
boys
go
to
playin
pranks
on
her
it
ll
be
just
pusly
mean
she
s
jest
a
girl
an
she
s
so
pretty
an
don
t
look
like
she
was
used
to
rough
boys
like
you
we
don
t
want
no
to
teach
us
declared
liakim
morse
a
bold
boy
who
always
followed
daniel
s
lead
in
everything
and
then
went
a
step
further
we
want
a
to
teach
us
the
selectmen
ll
soon
find
out
they
can
t
put
no
baby
teachers
off
on
us
fer
we
won
t
stand
it
peggy
made
a
face
at
them
and
turned
her
back
but
daniel
only
grinned
he
had
his
plan
and
he
knew
it
would
be
carried
out
he
did
not
need
to
say
much
to
his
followers
the
program
was
well
understood
by
them
one
of
the
selectmen
who
lived
near
the
came
over
with
the
key
and
stayed
about
the
place
opening
the
windows
and
setting
the
teacher
s
desk
in
order
the
scholars
were
all
seated
demurely
with
books
before
them
when
the
minister
came
walking
in
with
dawn
shy
and
smiling
by
his
side
not
one
of
them
seemed
to
be
looking
her
over
curiously
for
it
was
done
from
the
side
of
their
eyes
but
a
kind
of
groan
went
softly
over
the
back
rows
where
the
bigger
boys
sat
as
much
as
to
say
this
job
is
too
easy
it
s
scarcely
worth
our
attention
why
didn
t
you
send
us
some
one
worthy
of
our
valor
dawn
looked
them
over
her
heart
beating
a
trifle
fast
but
her
face
on
the
whole
quite
confident
and
happy
they
noted
the
confidence
in
the
tilt
of
her
chin
and
it
gave
them
intense
pleasure
to
think
how
soon
they
could
dispel
it
they
failed
however
to
note
the
firmness
of
that
chin
or
the
determination
in
the
line
of
the
softly
curving
red
lips
they
looked
at
their
victim
warily
and
rejoiced
in
her
youth
and
beauty
they
had
vanquished
many
before
but
never
one
so
lovely
so
or
so
confident
it
was
an
insult
to
their
manhood
that
the
selectmen
should
have
thought
she
could
teach
them
the
minister
introduced
miss
montgomery
to
the
selectman
who
shook
hands
with
her
wished
her
well
and
departed
then
the
good
old
man
made
a
few
gentle
remarks
to
the
effect
that
they
should
reflect
on
the
goodness
of
the
new
teacher
to
whom
he
referred
as
our
young
friend
in
coming
to
teach
them
and
guide
them
into
the
devious
ways
of
knowledge
and
that
they
should
refrain
from
all
annoying
conduct
during
her
stay
and
behave
as
model
scholars
should
the
minister
had
spent
much
thought
upon
this
speech
and
felt
that
he
had
worded
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
appeal
to
the
sympathy
of
all
the
children
in
all
his
mild
and
reasonable
life
he
had
never
been
able
to
comprehend
the
sinful
workings
of
the
unregenerate
heart
of
a
boy
he
could
conceive
of
no
reason
why
a
boy
or
a
girl
would
be
mischievous
in
school
if
the
matter
were
presented
rightly
to
their
minds
he
felt
that
he
had
put
it
before
them
as
it
should
be
made
to
appear
and
looking
into
the
demure
faces
he
hoped
that
he
had
accomplished
his
end
and
that
the
sweet
young
stranger
would
have
opportunity
to
prove
that
she
was
capable
of
teaching
that
school
though
exceedingly
doubtful
of
the
experiment
he
wanted
her
to
have
a
fair
chance
after
giving
one
long
lingering
look
toward
the
back
row
of
scholars
whose
studious
appearance
was
almost
portentous
in
its
gravity
the
old
clergyman
sighed
with
relief
and
turned
with
a
smile
of
farewell
toward
the
new
teacher
miss
montgomery
i
will
leave
you
with
your
school
he
said
i
m
sure
that
they
all
appreciate
how
hard
is
the
first
day
in
a
new
school
and
that
they
will
do
their
best
to
make
it
easy
for
you
he
bowed
and
went
out
his
last
glance
had
shown
him
a
vision
of
serious
faces
bent
upon
open
books
yet
he
felt
a
strange
and
apparently
most
uncalled
for
foreboding
dawn
surveyed
the
whole
quiet
room
with
a
smile
then
she
untied
her
bonnet
took
off
her
cape
and
carried
them
to
the
hook
in
the
corner
obviously
used
for
that
purpose
by
other
teachers
how
did
the
boys
on
the
back
seat
time
the
minister
exactly
so
as
to
know
just
the
instant
he
reached
the
corner
beyond
the
blacksmith
s
and
was
out
of
hearing
dawn
had
turned
from
a
room
full
of
model
scholars
to
hang
up
her
mantle
and
bonnet
turning
back
she
beheld
pandemonium
let
loose
something
struck
her
on
the
cheek
something
else
stung
her
forehead
the
whole
room
seemed
white
with
hard
little
flying
objects
some
of
them
were
of
paper
wet
and
soft
some
were
bits
of
chalk
it
was
like
a
summer
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
to
it
the
bewildered
young
teacher
surveyed
the
scene
for
an
instant
surprise
growing
into
indignation
at
the
outrage
she
was
young
enough
to
like
fun
as
well
as
any
one
and
for
an
instant
she
felt
like
laughing
at
the
sight
then
she
realized
that
it
was
intended
as
an
insult
and
as
an
open
rebellion
against
her
authority
it
hurt
her
sharply
that
they
thus
arrayed
themselves
against
her
at
the
outset
without
giving
her
a
chance
to
show
them
what
she
was
well
if
they
would
be
enemies
she
would
show
them
she
could
fight
the
crucial
test
of
which
she
had
been
warned
was
upon
her
she
must
make
good
now
if
she
would
hope
to
at
all
this
critical
moment
would
tell
whether
she
could
ever
teach
that
school
or
any
other
in
her
imagination
she
saw
the
regretful
look
in
the
kindly
minister
s
eyes
and
the
line
of
his
mouth
which
would
say
i
told
you
so
and
she
did
not
mean
he
should
be
disappointed
or
rather
she
meant
that
he
should
be
happily
disappointed
in
an
instant
she
was
on
the
alert
again
her
senses
collected
as
ever
in
a
crisis
she
was
cool
and
able
to
move
deliberately
it
took
but
a
second
for
her
to
find
out
who
was
the
leader
of
the
unruly
scholars
the
tall
form
of
daniel
butterworth
towered
above
the
rest
in
the
back
line
and
the
grin
on
his
impudent
face
showed
he
was
enjoying
the
affair
immensely
without
an
effort
he
was
evidently
directing
the
whole
thing
a
great
indignation
came
into
dawn
s
eyes
and
the
soft
lips
set
in
determination
like
a
flash
she
dashed
across
the
room
dodging
the
missiles
that
pelted
through
the
air
from
every
side
straight
at
daniel
butterworth
she
came
the
bully
and
the
leader
he
was
the
tallest
and
strongest
boy
in
the
school
and
no
teacher
had
ever
dared
make
a
direct
attack
upon
him
usually
the
teachers
punished
the
smaller
boys
for
the
sins
that
were
really
daniel
s
dawn
with
her
quick
perception
located
the
cause
of
the
trouble
and
impulsively
went
straight
to
the
mark
with
her
discipline
the
scholars
paused
in
their
entertainment
to
see
what
would
happen
next
and
little
peggy
gillette
began
to
cry
oh
teacher
teacher
don
t
ye
don
t
ye
he
won
t
stand
it
he
won
t
but
peggy
s
voice
was
drowned
in
the
general
hubbub
which
subsided
suddenly
into
ominous
silence
as
dawn
took
hold
of
daniel
butterworth
s
arm
and
jerked
him
into
the
seat
daniel
of
course
did
not
expect
the
attack
or
he
would
not
have
been
so
easily
thrown
off
his
balance
but
coming
down
on
the
seat
so
unexpectedly
bewildered
him
and
before
he
could
understand
what
had
happened
blows
began
to
rain
upon
his
head
and
face
and
ears
not
that
they
hurt
him
much
for
dawn
had
no
ruler
or
switch
or
any
of
the
implements
wherewith
to
exercise
discipline
she
used
her
hands
her
small
soft
pink
palms
that
were
daintily
shaped
and
delicately
eared
for
and
had
never
seen
any
hard
labor
but
yet
were
strong
and
supple
as
he
sat
still
and
allowed
the
new
teacher
to
administer
justice
daniel
resembled
a
kitten
backing
off
with
flattened
ears
and
ruffled
fur
and
submitting
to
a
severe
slapping
for
some
misdemeanor
nothing
so
soft
and
wonderful
as
dawn
s
hands
had
ever
touched
the
boy
s
face
before
he
sat
and
took
the
experience
in
a
dazed
delight
subsiding
and
shrinking
at
every
blow
which
yet
gave
him
a
delicious
sense
of
pleasure
as
if
it
were
some
kind
of
attention
she
was
offering
him
probably
in
no
other
way
could
she
have
ever
won
this
boy
s
admiration
after
the
chastisement
was
over
he
sat
still
blushing
and
smiling
sheepishly
as
if
he
were
glad
of
her
victory
while
all
the
rest
of
the
school
stood
gaping
in
amazement
their
hero
had
fallen
he
had
been
conquered
by
a
woman
a
woman
who
was
only
a
girl
how
could
any
of
them
ever
again
hope
to
stand
against
a
teacher
if
the
heart
of
the
strong
dan
butterworth
melted
like
wax
in
her
hands
dawn
whirled
upon
them
all
you
may
sit
down
she
commanded
grandly
and
they
sat
what
is
your
name
she
asked
turning
back
to
daniel
he
th
dan
butterwuth
volunteered
an
from
the
front
of
the
room
dawn
looked
daniel
straight
in
the
eye
with
a
long
burning
scathing
scorn
you
great
big
baby
she
said
at
last
her
cheeks
a
beautiful
red
her
eyes
bright
with
the
excitement
of
the
encounter
aren
t
you
ashamed
the
rich
red
stole
up
into
the
boy
s
face
mantling
cheek
and
brow
and
seeming
to
bring
a
glow
even
into
the
rough
tawny
hair
and
yellow
curling
lashes
as
he
dropped
his
eyes
in
a
kind
of
happy
shame
it
was
the
first
shame
perhaps
that
he
had
ever
been
made
to
feel
and
it
was
real
shame
yet
it
was
so
mixed
with
wholesome
admiration
of
the
small
beautiful
creature
who
had
brought
it
upon
him
that
it
left
him
unable
to
understand
himself
so
he
grew
redder
though
there
was
no
look
of
anger
about
him
and
soon
his
habitual
smile
was
growing
again
although
this
time
it
was
tinged
with
reverence
and
quite
lacked
its
usual
impudence
the
scholars
marvelled
at
him
as
the
new
teacher
left
him
with
the
brand
of
baby
sealed
with
her
beautiful
scorn
dawn
went
back
to
her
seat
on
the
platform
behind
the
big
desk
and
daniel
sat
still
only
lifting
his
curly
lashes
to
get
another
glimpse
of
the
loveliness
and
daring
which
had
attacked
and
conquered
him
bug
higginson
a
small
round
imp
who
adored
daniel
seemed
to
feel
that
the
erstwhile
leader
would
expect
something
of
his
followers
so
he
delivered
himself
of
a
fiendish
grimace
toward
the
teacher
which
set
the
girls
near
him
to
giggling
and
of
which
dawn
had
the
full
benefit
just
as
she
sat
down
you
may
come
here
commanded
dawn
pointing
straight
at
bug
with
a
ruler
she
found
on
the
desk
come
here
and
sit
on
this
stool
she
placed
a
stool
near
her
own
chair
and
waited
for
him
to
obey
bug
made
another
grimace
and
responded
pertly
i
won
t
it
was
very
quietly
and
swiftly
done
and
no
one
in
the
school
saw
the
beginning
because
they
were
watching
bug
and
the
teacher
but
somehow
an
instant
after
bug
had
declined
to
obey
he
was
taken
by
the
nape
of
his
neck
and
the
seat
of
his
trousers
and
deposited
on
the
required
stool
while
daniel
butterworth
was
making
his
way
back
to
his
seat
with
a
look
of
unconcern
upon
his
face
bug
was
too
astonished
and
too
much
afraid
of
daniel
to
make
a
sound
or
move
a
muscle
dawn
looked
at
the
long
lank
boy
as
he
sprawled
back
into
his
seat
and
raised
his
curly
eyelashes
to
see
how
she
would
take
his
action
and
there
flashed
into
her
eyes
a
kindling
of
surprise
gratitude
and
understanding
the
school
sat
in
mild
dismay
the
fun
had
vanished
and
before
their
halting
eyes
stretched
a
monotonous
vista
of
uninteresting
school
days
for
they
saw
plainly
that
the
leader
had
gone
over
to
the
enemy
and
they
must
surrender
at
intervals
during
the
day
some
boy
would
attempt
to
bring
about
another
insurrection
but
he
would
be
promptly
silenced
by
daniel
who
every
time
received
as
reward
a
look
of
gratitude
from
dawn
s
expressive
eyes
and
every
time
the
beautiful
glance
gave
him
a
new
thrill
of
pleasure
he
sat
docile
as
a
lamb
and
let
her
make
him
study
a
thing
he
had
never
done
before
in
his
whole
life
now
and
then
he
raised
his
eyes
dumb
submissive
and
met
hers
and
the
shock
of
a
great
revolution
reverberated
through
his
nature
he
did
not
know
what
it
meant
he
did
not
know
why
he
was
enjoying
the
morning
so
keenly
but
he
entered
into
the
new
state
of
things
as
in
a
dream
of
bliss
at
recess
time
the
boys
who
had
always
followed
his
lead
in
everything
began
to
jeer
at
him
about
the
way
he
had
given
in
to
a
girl
and
let
her
whip
him
he
did
not
turn
red
nor
look
embarrassed
he
promptly
settled
the
boldest
of
them
with
a
few
blows
from
his
loosely
hung
arms
and
the
others
considered
it
wise
to
desist
it
was
plain
that
the
former
bully
of
the
school
had
fallen
in
the
new
teacher
s
snare
and
as
it
was
well
known
to
be
unsafe
to
arouse
his
fiery
temper
the
other
boys
had
no
choice
but
to
follow
in
his
lead
if
you
fellers
say
a
word
about
her
nodded
toward
the
i
ll
lick
every
last
one
of
yeh
an
i
mean
it
too
he
threatened
and
then
he
walked
away
and
sat
down
under
the
big
elm
to
whittle
he
always
sat
down
to
whittle
after
he
had
presented
an
ultimatum
to
the
other
boys
at
her
desk
opposite
the
schoolroom
door
dawn
heard
this
deliverance
as
he
intended
she
should
and
her
eyes
grew
bright
she
understood
that
daniel
butterworth
was
her
champion
and
felt
her
courage
grow
stronger
at
the
thought
in
a
moment
more
she
stood
at
the
door
looking
out
daniel
looked
up
from
his
whittling
and
met
her
gaze
she
was
smiling
and
he
felt
that
she
no
longer
considered
him
a
baby
the
diminutive
had
rankled
in
his
heart
and
henceforth
his
purpose
was
to
prove
to
her
that
it
was
undeserved
if
good
behavior
and
hard
study
alone
could
do
that
then
he
would
behave
and
study
though
it
was
a
new
mode
of
procedure
for
him
the
most
interesting
fact
of
the
morning
was
that
daniel
butterworth
had
given

chapter
xx
dawn
went
back
to
the
golden
swan
that
evening
tired
but
triumphant
she
had
had
a
most
successful
session
of
school
and
she
knew
it
she
felt
the
victor
s
blood
running
wildly
through
her
veins
and
longed
to
have
the
minister
know
how
well
she
had
succeeded
the
teaching
part
had
not
troubled
her
in
the
least
fresh
from
blest
with
a
love
of
study
and
a
gift
for
imparting
knowledge
she
entered
into
the
work
with
a
zest
the
problem
of
discipline
which
had
bade
fair
in
the
morning
to
shipwreck
her
hopes
had
resolved
itself
into
a
very
simple
matter
since
she
had
conquered
the
school
leader
it
puzzled
her
a
little
to
know
just
how
she
had
done
it
and
why
he
had
succumbed
so
easily
yet
she
felt
a
pleasant
elation
in
recognizing
the
power
she
had
over
him
as
she
lay
in
her
little
room
after
the
candle
was
out
that
night
she
pondered
it
and
resolved
to
try
to
help
daniel
to
be
a
fine
fellow
perhaps
some
day
he
would
grow
to
be
something
like
charles
he
never
could
be
as
fine
and
noble
of
course
for
he
was
a
rough
boy
uncultured
and
ignorant
but
he
had
nice
eyes
and
he
might
develop
good
qualities
if
he
were
helped
dawn
would
have
been
horrified
if
she
could
have
known
that
instead
of
loafing
with
the
men
at
the
grocery
where
he
usually
spent
his
evenings
daniel
was
at
that
moment
standing
in
the
dark
of
the
kitchen
porch
of
his
home
behind
the
cool
vines
looking
out
at
the
stars
and
thinking
with
wonder
of
the
delight
it
had
been
to
have
her
soft
hands
strike
his
face
and
her
dainty
personality
flash
down
upon
him
even
in
her
beautiful
wrath
daniel
butterworth
was
only
a
boy
yet
but
new
thoughts
were
stirring
in
his
heart
and
an
absorbing
admiration
for
her
had
entered
into
his
soul
to
stay
hitherto
he
had
been
a
big
rollicking
animal
his
mind
had
been
upon
either
fun
or
practical
matters
never
upon
books
he
had
not
been
taught
to
think
his
surroundings
had
been
rough
and
practical
nothing
beautiful
had
ever
touched
him
before
yet
his
soul
had
responded
quickly
now
that
it
had
come
and
in
one
brief
day
daniel
seemed
to
have
grown
beyond
his
seventeen
years
and
to
have
come
suddenly
face
to
face
with
manhood
and
the
cause
of
his
sudden
awakening
had
been
the
new
teacher
s
hands
so
small
and
soft
and
yet
so
strong
as
he
thought
about
them
they
seemed
to
have
been
made
of
finer
stuff
than
most
women
s
hands
to
have
been
tinted
like
the
inner
leaf
of
a
rose
and
to
have
borne
a
subtle
perfume
upon
his
senses
how
he
could
have
seen
their
color
when
the
were
smiting
stinging
blows
upon
his
closed
eyes
he
did
not
stop
to
reason
he
leaned
his
face
against
a
great
leaf
in
the
darkness
and
its
coolness
against
his
fevered
cheeks
reminded
him
of
her
hands
and
thrilled
him
in
a
way
he
did
not
understand
he
looked
up
at
the
stars
between
the
strings
on
which
the
twined
and
wondered
at
himself
and
thrilled
again
with
a
solemn
joy
but
all
he
knew
was
that
he
liked
the
new
teacher
and
meant
to
study
hard
if
that
would
please
her
and
that
he
would
lick
any
boy
that
dared
molest
her
or
disturb
her
gentle
rule
so
much
the
little
hands
had
accomplished
in
their
first
quick
decisive
battle
then
daniel
kicked
off
his
boots
noisily
and
tiptoed
up
the
creaking
stairs
to
his
attic
chamber
to
make
his
mother
think
he
had
been
at
the
village
store
as
usual
not
for
the
world
would
he
have
her
know
he
had
spent
the
evening
among
the
kitchen
thinking
about
a
girl
and
she
a
schoolmarm
at
that
he
blushed
deeply
in
the
darkness
at
the
thought
after
that
first
day
of
getting
acquainted
with
her
scholars
and
finding
out
who
were
in
the
various
classes
dawn
fashioned
her
school
on
the
model
of
friend
ruth
s
as
nearly
as
was
consistent
with
existing
circumstances
the
rules
she
laid
down
were
stricter
than
the
village
school
had
ever
known
before
and
went
more
into
detail
a
code
of
ethics
was
gradually
formed
among
the
scholars
who
followed
the
lead
of
daniel
butterworth
and
succumbed
to
the
leadership
of
the
new
teacher
her
beauty
and
her
youth
combined
to
make
both
boys
and
girls
fall
victims
to
her
charm
they
fairly
worshipped
at
her
shrine
and
went
long
pilgrimages
after
berries
or
rare
flowers
and
ferns
that
they
might
be
rewarded
with
the
flash
of
gratitude
in
her
lovely
eyes
they
suffered
torments
in
refraining
from
their
usual
mischief
that
they
might
escape
the
flash
of
steel
from
those
same
eyes
for
once
that
was
felt
they
had
no
desire
to
it
it
became
the
fashion
to
treat
her
as
a
sort
of
queen
and
dawn
was
very
gracious
to
her
subjects
though
always
masterful
she
smiled
upon
their
offerings
impartially
even
upon
bug
higginson
s
small
sister
s
donation
of
moistly
withered
dandelions
yet
when
she
discovered
some
deviation
from
the
laws
she
had
laid
down
she
was
severity
itself
almost
flying
into
a
passion
with
them
outraged
goodness
in
her
eyes
and
impulsive
intensity
in
her
every
motion
at
such
times
she
seemed
to
have
a
special
gift
of
speech
coming
directly
to
the
point
and
saying
the
things
that
would
most
cut
the
culprit
once
behind
a
stump
fence
in
the
woods
she
came
upon
a
row
of
her
boys
placidly
smoking
pipes
in
imitation
of
the
village
of
their
respected
fathers
each
of
whom
had
threatened
dire
things
to
his
offspring
if
he
was
ever
caught
at
the
practice
her
horror
and
disgust
quickly
blazed
into
words
until
every
boy
wished
that
a
hole
would
open
in
the
ground
wide
enough
to
swallow
him
for
a
little
while
dawn
had
no
convictions
or
principles
about
the
matter
she
was
moved
by
an
innate
dislike
of
the
practice
intensified
by
the
fact
that
harrington
winthrop
had
once
smoked
in
her
company
while
walking
with
her
in
the
woods
and
had
never
even
asked
permission
the
smell
of
tobacco
smoke
ever
after
gave
her
a
sickening
sense
of
dislike
the
boys
threw
their
pipes
away
and
daniel
butterworth
rising
from
the
root
of
the
tree
on
which
he
had
been
seated
commanded
fellers
if
she
don
t
like
it
we
quit
d
ye
understand
we
quit
entirely
i
ll
thrash
any
boy
that
breaks
the
rule
the
pipes
were
thrown
away
and
seven
boys
with
very
red
cheeks
and
downcast
eyes
entered
school
a
trifle
late
that
noon
and
sheepishly
slunk
to
their
desks
the
next
morning
daniel
butterworth
was
found
tacking
up
on
the
blackboard
a
clipping
from
a
newspaper
in
which
was
set
forth
how
a
certain
eliphalet
howe
a
guest
at
the
tremont
house
in
boston
had
been
arrested
for
breaking
the
law
which
declared
that
there
should
be
no
smoking
on
the
streets
the
said
eliphalet
had
been
found
guilty
and
fined
dollars
for
the
offense
though
he
had
pleaded
in
defense
that
the
sidewalk
where
he
stood
to
smoke
was
in
front
of
the
tremont
house
and
that
therefore
as
he
was
on
the
premises
of
the
house
where
he
was
stopping
he
was
not
breaking
the
law
at
recess
the
scholars
filed
solemnly
around
and
read
the
item
and
looked
with
awe
at
daniel
who
read
the
papers
and
knew
so
much
about
affairs
dawn
smiled
to
herself
to
see
how
daniel
was
helping
her
but
dawn
knew
nothing
of
the
thrashings
her
champion
gave
to
the
smokers
whose
habits
were
not
easily
broken
up
nor
how
they
were
forced
to
find
other
quarters
for
their
secret
meetings
or
scatter
by
themselves
in
hiding
to
pursue
the
practice
public
opinion
had
turned
and
it
was
no
longer
popular
to
do
anything
the
teacher
disliked
daniel
was
even
known
to
send
two
boys
home
one
day
as
they
entered
the
school
yard
because
they
smelled
of
smoke
and
he
had
told
them
the
teacher
did
not
like
it
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
in
so
large
a
school
everything
would
always
be
pleasant
and
easy
nor
that
the
scholars
would
always
be
angels
they
had
their
noisy
days
and
their
mischievous
days
and
their
stupid
days
and
now
and
then
dawn
felt
disheartened
and
discouraged
but
matters
were
made
far
easier
for
her
than
she
perhaps
fully
realized
because
of
daniel
butterworth
and
his
devotion
to
her
dawn
was
grateful
to
the
boy
and
in
return
for
his
championship
she
let
him
carry
her
books
home
walking
a
little
way
behind
with
some
of
his
devoted
boy
followers
while
she
was
escorted
by
an
eager
group
of
little
girls
at
first
there
was
a
sort
of
jealousy
of
her
among
the
older
girls
who
were
inclined
to
toss
their
heads
and
whisper
among
themselves
that
she
was
no
older
than
they
so
why
should
she
put
on
so
many
airs
they
suspected
her
of
taking
the
attention
of
the
boys
away
from
them
but
as
the
days
went
by
and
dawn
entered
into
her
work
with
enthusiasm
planning
debates
and
plays
and
readings
for
them
and
making
even
the
dullest
lessons
glow
with
interest
because
she
really
seemed
to
like
them
herself
opposition
melted
away
and
they
succumbed
to
her
charm
for
one
so
young
and
inexperienced
it
was
wonderful
what
she
could
do
with
those
girls
and
boys
the
parents
began
to
talk
about
it
the
minister
saw
it
with
gratification
and
pleased
himself
by
thinking
his
child
might
have
been
like
that
if
she
had
lived
presently
the
whole
town
was
proud
to
own
her
as
a
kind
of
public
institution
like
the
doctor
and
the
minister
there
were
a
few
old
ladies
who
shook
their
heads
and
wondered
how
it
was
that
she
had
come
so
far
from
that
wicked
city
of
new
york
to
teach
their
school
without
there
being
a
single
relative
in
the
vicinity
the
village
seamstress
with
half
a
dozen
pins
in
one
corner
of
her
mouth
would
talk
about
it
wherever
she
went
to
work
and
say
what
i
d
like
to
know
is
who
knows
anything
about
her
what
is
she
why
doesn
t
she
tell
about
herself
but
in
spite
of
all
dawn
walked
calmly
back
and
forth
to
her
school
and
managed
the
scholars
with
a
degree
of
dignity
and
skill
that
would
have
done
credit
to
a
far
older
teacher
the
whole
town
gradually
began
to
love
her
it
was
a
nine
days
wonder
that
daniel
butterworth
had
been
so
changed
by
her
influence
his
mother
never
could
get
done
thanking
the
new
teacher
sometimes
with
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
often
she
would
send
to
her
by
daniel
a
paper
of
fresh
doughnuts
or
a
soft
or
even
a
juicy
as
a
token
of
her
thankfulness
dawn
was
boarding
round
and
the
days
she
spent
at
the
butterworths
comfortable
old
farmhouse
were
one
continual
jubilee
for
the
family
and
a
season
of
triumph
for
the
teacher
the
best
dishes
and
the
finest
were
got
out
and
a
fire
was
built
in
the
solemn
front
room
there
after
the
supper
which
was
composed
of
all
the
nicest
things
butterworth
knew
how
to
concoct
the
family
would
gather
around
the
teacher
to
listen
while
she
talked
or
read
to
them
and
dawn
because
she
wanted
to
help
daniel
and
also
because
she
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
admiration
and
attention
she
was
receiving
entered
into
it
all
and
hunted
out
stories
to
read
to
them
and
finally
gave
them
a
taste
of
shakespeare
which
she
read
with
remarkable
understanding
and
dramatic
power
considering
that
she
had
never
had
any
interpreter
but
herself
a
new
world
was
opened
to
the
house
of
butterworth
even
the
old
farmer
sat
and
listened
watching
the
wonderful
change
of
expression
on
the
beautiful
girlish
face
there
were
flowers
in
a
tumbler
on
the
stiffly
arranged
by
daniel
s
oldest
sister
rachel
daniel
wet
and
combed
his
tawny
hair
before
he
came
to
meals
it
was
unusual
and
the
smaller
children
noticed
and
followed
suit
it
was
one
day
when
dawn
sat
at
the
table
talking
and
laughing
and
making
them
all
forget
the
of
life
with
her
cheeks
as
red
as
the
late
pink
aster
tucked
in
among
her
curls
that
daniel
s
mother
noticed
with
a
heart
of
satisfaction
the
look
on
her
boy
s
face
that
daniel
should
take
to
a
girl
like
that
was
all
and
more
than
her
mother
heart
could
wish
and
why
not
were
not
the
butterworths
well
off
was
not
their
farm
the
largest
and
most
flourishing
in
the
whole
country
true
they
had
not
painted
their
house
in
a
long
time
and
didn
t
go
in
much
for
fancy
dressing
but
that
was
easily
changed
and
the
barns
had
always
been
kept
in
fine
repair
which
was
a
good
test
of
prosperity
thus
butterworth
meditated
in
the
watches
of
the
night
but
she
never
mentioned
the
matter
even
to
the
boy
s
father
for
john
was
turrible
easy
upset
of
an
idea
an
it
was
just
as
well
to
let
things
take
their
own
way
long
s
it
was
sech
a
good
way
for
once
but
dawn
had
no
idea
that
any
such
notion
had
entered
the
good
woman
s
head
and
enjoyed
her
stay
at
the
butterworths
heartily
going
on
to
the
next
place
with
regret
there
were
places
where
boarding
round
was
not
altogether
agreeable
where
the
rooms
were
small
and
cold
and
had
to
be
shared
with
younger
members
of
the
family
where
the
blankets
were
thin
or
the
odorous
where
the
morning
s
ham
sizzling
in
the
spider
on
the
kitchen
stove
below
came
up
through
wide
cracks
in
unappetizing
smoke
where
the
master
of
the
house
was
gruff
and
her
welcome
was
grudgingly
given
many
a
night
she
cried
herself
to
sleep
in
these
places
and
wondered
why
she
had
been
born
to
suffer
so
and
to
be
so
lonely
the
thought
of
charles
and
of
the
day
of
her
wedding
was
growing
to
be
like
a
dim
and
misty
dream
she
still
hugged
it
to
her
heart
as
a
most
precious
treasure
but
day
by
day
it
was
becoming
more
unreal
to
her
however
take
it
all
in
all
dawn
was
perhaps
happier
than
she
had
been
since
she
was
a
tiny
child
with
her
mother
she
was
interested
in
her
work
enjoyed
the
companionship
of
many
of
the
children
and
was
pleased
to
feel
that
she
was
independent
and
of
her
own
private
fortune
she
never
thought
she
had
been
told
that
there
was
money
left
to
her
by
her
mother
s
father
but
it
made
little
impression
and
she
had
never
cared
to
ask
how
much
it
was
just
a
part
of
the
world
she
had
left
behind
her
when
she
ran
away
in
her
attempt
to
undo
mischief
she
had
never
meant
to
do
she
kept
herself
much
more
strictly
than
friend
ruth
had
ever
succeeded
in
doing
feeling
as
she
did
her
responsibility
now
that
she
was
a
real
teacher
but
she
allowed
herself
many
a
playtime
as
the
winter
drew
on
and
the
made
coasting
and
skating
possible
there
was
a
hill
behind
the
where
at
noon
she
coasted
with
her
scholars
shouting
and
laughing
with
the
rest
each
boy
strove
to
have
the
honor
of
her
company
upon
his
sled
but
she
distributed
her
favors
impartially
it
was
only
when
she
went
home
with
bug
higginson
to
spend
her
week
and
discovered
to
her
dismay
where
he
got
his
nickname
that
her
heart
failed
her
entirely
and
she
felt
she
had
met
with
something
she
could
not
bear
however
that
experience
did
not
last
forever
and
dawn
went
cheerily
on
her
way
brightening
the
whole
town
with
her
presence
which
now
that
she
was
set
free
from
the
confines
and
oppression
that
had
always
been
about
her
seemed
to
grow
and
glow
with
a
beautiful
inner
life
the
were
not
the
only
ones
who
admired
the
new
teacher
and
sought
her
society
there
was
not
a
young
man
in
town
who
did
not
gaze
after
her
as
she
went
down
the
street
and
wish
himself
a
scholar
again
in
the
old
red
about
christmas
time
a
new
annoyance
loomed
up
and
threatened
to
spoil
dawn
s
bright
prospects
suddenly
without
warning
the
youngest
of
the
selectmen
silas
dobson
took
a
violent
interest
in
the
school
he
would
drop
in
at
all
hours
and
stay
the
session
out
taking
occasion
to
walk
home
with
the
teacher
if
possible
daniel
who
had
never
presumed
to
walk
beside
her
alone
frowned
heavily
and
grew
almost
morose
as
the
thing
was
repeated
dawn
was
very
polite
and
a
little
frightened
at
first
it
spoiled
the
cosy
feeling
of
her
school
to
have
visitors
the
presence
of
this
particular
selectman
stirred
up
the
latent
mischief
in
the
scholars
as
his
visits
were
repeated
the
teacher
was
filled
with
a
growing
consternation
silas
was
a
long
thin
man
about
thirty
years
old
a
widower
with
five
children
and
an
angular
mother
who
kept
them
in
order
he
was
the
editor
of
the
village
paper
and
as
a
literary
man
he
claimed
that
he
felt
a
deep
responsibility
toward
the
school
daniel
heard
him
say
this
one
day
and
told
the
boys
he
d
knock
silas
s
responsibility
into
a
cocked
hat
if
he
bothered
the
teacher
much
more
daniel
s
opportunity
arrived
one
night
when
there
was
a
quilting
bee
out
the
old
turnpike
road
and
everybody
was
invited
to
the
supper
the
quilting
began
in
the
afternoon
and
dawn
closed
school
early
so
that
she
and
the
older
girls
might
attend
the
young
men
were
coming
to
supper
and
they
were
all
to
ride
home
in
the
moonlight
with
her
thimble
in
her
pocket
and
her
eyes
shining
dawn
hurried
off
from
the
in
company
with
the
older
girls
who
could
sew
they
looked
back
once
to
wave
their
hands
toward
the
group
of
boys
who
lingered
wistfully
behind
keeping
watch
of
them
the
older
boys
were
to
come
to
the
quilting
bee
later
but
they
of
the
afternoon
was
a
long
blank
in
spite
of
good
skating
and
the
somehow
the
coming
of
the
new
teacher
had
made
them
more
anxious
to
have
the
girls
along
and
to
have
a
good
time
all
together
but
they
consoled
themselves
with
the
anticipation
of
the
evening
the
teacher
had
promised
to
ride
home
with
them
and
they
were
planning
a
big
all
huddled
happily
on
the
straw
with
songs
and
shoutings
and
a
good
time
generally
dawn
was
looking
forward
to
the
ride
as
much
as
any
of
them
but
silas
dobson
had
other
plans
he
brought
his
own
horse
and
cutter
and
having
arranged
that
his
mother
should
return
home
with
a
neighbor
he
himself
planned
to
monopolize
the
teacher
to
this
end
soon
after
supper
he
edged
over
to
where
she
sat
among
the
girls
and
conferred
the
honor
of
his
company
upon
her
for
the
ride
home
at
least
that
was
the
impression
he
gave
as
he
told
her
that
he
wished
her
to
go
home
with
him
oh
thank
you
said
dawn
politely
but
i
ve
already
promised
to
go
with
my
pupils
daniel
butterworth
is
to
bring
a
big
sleigh
and
we
are
all
going
home
together
silas
s
face
darkened
and
his
back
stiffened
that
will
be
quite
uncomfortable
for
you
he
said
decidedly
as
if
it
were
not
to
be
thought
of
dawn
wondered
why
it
was
that
people
were
always
taking
her
affairs
out
of
her
hands
so
confidently
without
asking
her
leave
but
she
was
no
longer
the
child
she
had
been
at
home
or
school
she
was
feeling
the
strength
of
independence
she
sat
up
with
dignity
oh
i
shall
enjoy
it
she
answered
sparkling
at
the
thought
my
cutter
is
here
and
you
d
better
go
with
me
said
silas
i
ll
speak
to
dan
about
it
and
make
it
all
right
so
he
won
t
expect
you
oh
please
don
t
do
that
cried
dawn
anxiously
why
was
it
he
reminded
her
so
much
of
harrington
winthrop
i
promised
daniel
and
the
children
i
wouldn
t
disappoint
them
for
anything
thank
you
just
the
same
some
one
else
came
up
then
and
silas
turned
away
but
dawn
watched
him
uneasily
from
the
look
on
his
face
one
would
have
thought
she
had
accepted
his
attention
with
delight
he
did
not
act
like
a
man
who
had
received
a
rebuff
later
when
dan
drove
his
horses
with
a
flourish
to
the
old
in
front
of
the
house
silas
was
waiting
for
him
you
needn
t
wait
for
miss
montgomery
dan
said
the
selectman
in
a
patronizing
tone
she
s
going
with
me
she
s
not
any
such
a
thing
growled
dan
she
promised
us
she
d
go
in
our
team
yes
she
was
afraid
you
d
be
disappointed
but
i
told
her
i
d
make
it
right
with
you
said
silas
in
a
soothing
tone
hurry
now
and
load
up
and
drive
out
of
the
way
don
t
you
see
the
other
folks
are
waiting
you
wouldn
t
stand
in
the
way
of
a
lady
s
comfort
would
you
especially
when
she
doesn
t
want
to
go
with
you
dan
glared
at
his
adversary
in
speechless
wrath
for
an
instant
while
the
girls
and
boys
were
climbing
in
then
gave
a
cut
to
his
horses
with
the
whip
and
drove
the
long
sleigh
with
its
merry
load
out
into
the
white
mist
of
the
moonlit
road
and
round
a
curve
to
the
fence
where
he
flung
the
reins
to
another
boy
telling
him
to
wait
and
keep
quiet
then
he
stole
back
around
the
house
and
stood
in
the
shadow
of
a
great
near
enough
to
hear
all
that
went
on
but
not
to
be
seen
the
guests
merrily
trooped
forth
in
the
path
of
that
shone
from
the
open
house
door
and
dawn
s
musical
laugh
rang
over
them
all
but
when
she
came
out
to
the
and
saw
silas
standing
alone
beside
his
cutter
she
drew
back
and
looked
around
in
dismay
why
where
is
daniel
she
asked
anxiously
they
told
me
he
wanted
me
to
come
now
daniel
has
gone
said
silas
pleasantly
i
explained
to
him
how
much
more
comfortable
it
would
be
for
you
in
my
sleigh
and
besides
he
was
crowded
as
it
was
he
hadn
t
room
enough
for
you
just
get
right
in
and
i
ll
show
you
what
my
mare
can
do
in
getting
you
over
the
snow
daniel
is
gone
dawn
echoed
in
a
troubled
voice
oh
no
thank
you
back
timidly
and
looking
toward
the
door
i
will
see
if
butterworth
is
inside
yet
i
can
go
with
her
i
will
not
trouble
you
but
silas
was
not
to
be
thus
set
aside
don
t
think
of
such
a
thing
he
commanded
just
get
right
in
he
reached
out
to
grasp
her
arm
and
detain
her
from
her
purpose
but
just
as
he
touched
the
sleeve
of
her
coat
his
arm
was
grasped
from
behind
and
a
skilful
thrust
of
daniel
butterworth
s
long
arm
sent
him
spinning
backward
into
a
big
snowbank
when
silas
dobson
arose
disconcerted
and
spluttering
from
the
dawn
had
vanished
whisked
around
the
in
a
jiffy
by
daniel
lifted
for
an
instant
in
his
strong
arms
carried
across
a
broad
expanse
of
unbroken
snow
and
tucked
neatly
into
the
sleigh
among
the
girls
and
boys
the
whole
had
divined
dan
s
purpose
and
they
kept
silent
until
she
was
safe
among
them
and
dan
in
the
front
seat
had
gathered
up
his
reins
again
then
they
gave
a
united
shout
which
rang
through
the
moonlit
air
and
struck
sharply
on
the
ears
of
the
disconcerted
silas
as
he
climbed
hastily
into
his
lone
sleigh
and
turned
his
horse
s
head
in
the
opposite
direction
the
next
time
silas
dobson
came
to
visit
the
school
he
stayed
after
hours
and
said
he
wished
to
talk
with
the
teacher
with
lowering
brow
daniel
lingered
in
the
back
of
the
room
phenomenally
busy
with
his
books
dawn
cast
a
frightened
look
around
and
her
eyes
rested
on
him
with
appeal
his
eyes
seemed
to
give
back
comfortable
assurance
of
help
as
he
sat
down
with
a
thump
and
began
to
figure
vigorously
at
a
sum
he
had
not
finished
in
the
arithmetic
class
silas
eyed
his
youthful
enemy
and
finally
requested
that
he
be
sent
home
as
he
wished
to
have
a
little
private
conversation
oh
laughed
dawn
loud
enough
for
daniel
to
hear
daniel
has
to
stay
to
finish
his
sums
it
would
not
do
for
me
to
let
him
go
i
might
lose
my
school
if
i
did
not
act
fairly
you
know
daniel
figured
away
vigorously
putting
down
any
numerals
that
entered
his
head
there
was
a
warm
feeling
around
his
heart
it
was
as
exhilarating
as
scoring
a
point
in
a
he
was
apparently
deaf
to
what
was
going
on
about
him
and
frowned
over
his
sum
in
feigned
perplexity
sit
down
dobson
went
on
dawn
summoning
all
her
dignity
we
can
talk
with
entire
freedom
here
daniel
is
busy
and
will
not
notice
she
spoke
in
a
low
distant
tone
and
seated
herself
at
the
desk
i
m
one
of
the
principal
selectman
frowned
dobson
as
he
sat
down
at
her
bidding
you
needn
t
be
afraid
to
send
him
home
it
isn
t
in
the
least
necessary
said
dawn
thankful
to
daniel
from
the
depths
of
her
heart
for
his
presence
silas
dobson
lowered
his
voice
and
drawing
gradually
nearer
to
the
teacher
launched
into
a
flowery
paragraph
which
he
had
prepared
and
rehearsed
before
his
mirror
it
contained
phases
about
miss
montgomery
s
starry
eyes
raven
locks
pearly
teeth
and
rosy
cheeks
and
was
calculated
to
convey
his
admiration
in
a
delicate
editorial
manner
noting
the
drooping
eyelashes
and
deepened
color
of
the
girl
before
him
he
proceeded
from
this
preamble
to
make
her
understand
that
his
interest
in
the
school
had
not
been
altogether
for
the
school
s
sake
and
that
he
was
offering
her
honorable
attentions
which
if
all
went
well
would
mean
a
proposal
of
marriage
later
if
he
could
have
seen
the
steel
flash
under
the
drooping
eyelashes
he
would
not
have
gone
on
to
impress
her
with
the
value
of
such
an
offer
nor
told
its
advantages
in
half
so
complacent
a
tone
as
usual
dawn
had
control
of
herself
in
this
unpleasant
crisis
and
while
his
words
filled
her
with
dismay
and
repulsion
her
tone
was
cool
low
deliberate
i
have
no
doubt
you
mean
to
be
kind
she
began
not
at
all
not
at
all
it
is
my
pleasure
and
my
will
he
interrupted
effusively
but
she
went
on
ignoring
his
interruption
i
have
no
desire
for
attention
from
any
one
and
will
have
to
ask
you
to
excuse
me
from
accepting
it
he
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
and
thought
she
must
be
coquetting
but
his
most
earnest
solicitations
failed
to
get
anything
further
from
her
than
the
fact
that
she
would
rather
not
receive
his
attentions
do
you
know
he
asked
angrily
that
i
am
a
man
of
importance
in
this
town
i
have
influence
enough
with
the
selectmen
to
take
this
school
away
from
you
if
i
choose
take
care
how
you
treat
me
i
suppose
there
are
schools
in
other
places
then
answered
dawn
coolly
looking
him
in
the
eye
now
though
she
felt
every
fibre
of
her
being
in
a
tremor
are
you
aware
miss
montgomery
that
i
am
an
editor
and
that
a
very
slight
word
from
my
pen
would
go
abroad
through
the
land
and
ruin
your
reputation
so
that
you
could
not
get
any
school
anywhere
i
can
not
see
why
you
should
want
to
do
such
an
unkind
thing
as
that
after
what
you
have
said
about
liking
me
but
if
you
do
you
need
not
stop
on
my
account
i
can
find
something
else
to
do
i
certainly
could
never
have
anything
more
to
do
with
a
man
that
threatened
such
things
i
did
not
say
i
would
do
any
such
thing
miss
montgomery
began
silas
eager
now
to
retract
his
angry
words
i
was
merely
trying
to
show
you
what
risks
you
were
taking
in
talking
to
me
as
you
did
i
mean
well
by
you
and
i
think
you
ought
to
appreciate
it
if
i
were
to
offer
these
attentions
to
any
other
girl
in
the
village
she
would
feel
flattered
daniel
s
voice
rang
clear
and
without
a
trace
of
the
excitement
she
was
if
you
need
help
with
those
sums
now
i
can
give
it
bring
them
up
here
please
daniel
lost
no
time
in
getting
to
his
feet
and
gathering
up
his
scattered
papers
but
the
selectman
arose
in
protest
and
put
out
his
hand
toward
the
teacher
don
t
call
that
boy
up
here
yet
he
commanded
and
dared
to
lay
his
hand
upon
the
girl
s
arm
as
he
did
so
bringing
his
smug
countenance
quite
near
that
he
might
speak
so
the
approaching
boy
would
not
hear
but
the
words
on
his
lips
were
never
uttered
without
an
instant
s
hesitation
dawn
sprang
away
from
him
crying
don
t
you
dare
to
touch
me
sir
and
with
catlike
agility
daniel
glided
up
the
aisle
and
struck
the
selectman
full
in
the
face
silas
reeled
backward
off
the
platform
and
staggered
ignominiously
against
the
wall
clutching
at
the
blackboard
rail
for
support
his
hat
rolling
at
his
feet
and
his
general
appearance
undignified
to
say
the
least
daniel
stood
in
a
combative
attitude
looking
at
him
contemptuously
he
would
have
enjoyed
nothing
better
than
to
give
silas
dobson
a
good
thrashing
you
shall
answer
for
this
you
young
rascal
threatened
silas
shaking
his
fist
at
daniel
as
he
recovered
his
balance
and
began
to
brush
the
chalk
dust
from
his
best
coat
this
is
the
second
offense
remember
silas
was
no
match
for
daniel
in
a
fight
and
he
knew
it
all
right
said
daniel
unconcerned
we
ll
see
who
does
the
answering
but
don
t
you
dare
touch
teacher
again
d
ye
hear
i
shall
have
a
talk
with
butterworth
who
is
also
a
selectman
and
with
the
minister
said
dawn
with
dignity
if
they
wish
me
to
give
up
the
school
i
will
do
so
and
thus
save
you
the
trouble
of
doing
what
you
have
threatened
mr
dobson
you
make
a
great
mistake
miss
montgomery
said
silas
thoroughly
alarmed
now
i
have
no
desire
to
have
you
give
up
the
school
well
i
guess
you
better
not
have
said
daniel
not
unless
you
want
a
good
coat
of
tar
and
feathers
there
was
a
look
of
wrath
in
the
boy
s
blue
eyes
that
boded
no
good
for
the
discomfited
selectman
you
have
not
understood
me
repeated
silas
lamely
glaring
with
helpless
anger
at
daniel
and
then
casting
a
wistful
appeal
at
the
teacher
but
dawn
had
taken
up
the
arithmetic
and
was
figuring
rapidly
she
only
raised
her
head
to
say
coldly
good
afternoon
dobson
you
will
do
me
a
favor
if
you
won
t
come
to
visit
the
school
any
more
you
hinder
my
work
and
i
do
not
like
it
then
she
turned
to
daniel
and
began
to
explain
the
sum
you
have
not
understood
me
murmured
silas
again
i
guess
you
ve
been
understood
all
right
said
daniel
grimly
over
his
shoulder
with
a
last
angry
glare
at
dawn
s
protector
and
a
threat
he
would
never
dare
to
carry
out
silas
dobson
took
himself
off
the
scene
of
action
the
next
week
there
appeared
a
prominent
editorial
about
the
public
school
and
its
brilliant
young
teacher
who
was
doing
so
much
for
the
youth
of
the
village
and
should
be
encouraged
in
every
way
by
the
parents
daniel
read
it
to
a
group
of
the
boys
in
the
school
yard
and
then
cut
it
out
with
his
penknife
and
pinned
it
to
the
blackboard
as
an
expression
of
the
sentiments
of
the
whole
school
after
that
little
episode
there
was
a
closer
bond
than
ever
between
daniel
and
his
teacher
they
never
talked
it
over
nor
even
mentioned
it
except
that
dawn
as
silas
s
footsteps
died
away
that
afternoon
had
put
her
little
hand
on
the
boy
s
rough
one
for
just
an
instant
and
said
thank
you
so
much
daniel
i
do
not
know
what
i
should
have
done
if
you
had
not
stayed
daniel
had
turned
away
with
a
sudden
feeling
as
if
he
was
going
to
choke
while
the
blood
in
his
heart
pounded
up
into
his
face
but
aloud
he
only
said
in
a
bashful
tone
aw
that
s
nothin
he
needs
a
good
lickin
an
i
d
like
to
be
the
one
to
give
it
to
him
afterward
dawn
wondered
that
she
had
dared
to
speak
as
she
had
to
silas
dobson
a
selectman
and
the
editor
of
the
paper
and
if
she
had
it
in
her
to
do
so
now
how
was
it
that
she
had
allowed
harrington
winthrop
to
lead
her
on
to
a
hated
marriage
when
she
might
have
easily
stopped
it
by
being
decided
had
her
brief
months
of
independence
given
her
courage
it
seemed
strange
to
her
now
that
she
had
been
so
afraid
to
tell
her
father
what
she
felt
about
it
until
matters
had
gone
so
far
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
stop
it
her
heart
burned
within
her
sometimes
to
go
back
and
tell
harrington
winthrop
just
what
she
felt
about
him
she
had
been
weak
she
decided
terribly
weak
in
yielding
in
the
beginning
to
her
desire
for
a
home
of
her
own
and
for
freedom
from
any
possibility
of
having
to
stay
in
the
house
with
her
father
s
wife
yet
were
not
all
women
weak
and
helpless
sometimes
when
it
came
to
a
testing
of
their
strength
against
men
her
mother
had
not
been
able
to
cope
with
her
father
s
will
it
was
all
a
world
and
full
of
trouble
she
turned
on
her
scanty
pillow
and
wished
for
the
dawn
of
a
day
that
would
have
no
sorrow
just
why
it
was
that
her
experience
with
silas
dobson
made
the
thought
of
charles
and
her
marriage
so
much
more
vivid
than
before
dawn
could
not
understand
and
she
thought
about
it
a
great
deal
in
the
watches
of
the
night
when
she
should
have
been
sleeping
a
new
phase
of
her
position
was
forced
upon
her
she
was
in
a
measure
deceiving
other
people
about
herself
silas
dobson
disagreeable
as
he
was
had
no
idea
that
his
attentions
were
an
insult
to
her
because
she
was
already
married
of
course
she
could
refuse
to
accept
attentions
from
any
one
but
if
silas
dobson
had
been
a
pleasant
and
agreeable
man
it
might
have
been
difficult
to
explain
to
him
without
telling
him
the
truth
why
she
could
not
ride
nor
walk
with
him
it
was
all
a
terrible
problem
and
night
after
night
she
cried
herself
to
sleep
sometimes
she
stayed
in
unpleasant
quarters
where
she
had
perhaps
to
climb
a
ladder
and
share
the
loft
above
the
kitchen
with
two
of
the
small
children
of
the
family
often
the
cracks
would
be
so
wide
that
the
snow
would
blow
in
drift
across
her
bed
and
even
blow
into
her
face
then
as
she
dropped
off
to
sleep
lulled
by
the
roar
of
the
wind
outside
she
would
wish
that
the
snow
might
come
softly
and
cover
her
out
of
sight
that
she
might
sleep
forever
at
other
times
the
thought
of
charles
brought
a
great
longing
to
see
him
and
to
hear
his
voice
whisper
my
darling
once
more
as
he
had
that
night
when
they
stood
for
one
blissful
moment
together
in
their
room
before
betty
called
them
then
dawn
would
go
over
all
the
happenings
of
the
evening
the
scene
at
the
supper
table
and
every
syllable
that
madam
winthrop
had
uttered
up
to
the
awful
moment
when
the
mother
had
hurled
her
accusations
and
the
truth
had
burst
upon
the
young
bride
s
heart
in
all
its
nakedness
that
she
was
married
out
of
generosity
bitterness
toward
this
woman
was
changing
slowly
into
understanding
how
was
the
mother
to
blame
for
what
she
had
said
it
was
all
true
except
that
she
dawn
had
not
known
it
and
was
therefore
not
to
blame
then
she
began
to
wonder
how
it
was
that
she
could
have
been
so
deceived
she
could
not
blame
her
for
doubting
her
word
for
would
not
she
also
doubt
that
a
girl
could
be
married
to
a
man
and
think
he
was
some
other
whose
fault
had
it
been
not
charles
s
for
he
had
fully
vindicated
himself
she
would
sooner
doubt
herself
than
him
could
her
father
have
known
about
it
could
he
have
wished
her
to
be
married
to
one
whom
she
did
not
know
without
even
telling
her
it
was
believable
that
he
might
have
thought
it
of
little
importance
to
her
if
he
her
father
willed
it
so
yet
while
often
treating
her
as
if
she
were
a
chattel
without
will
of
her
own
he
had
ever
been
perfectly
frank
with
her
she
felt
that
he
would
have
informed
her
of
the
change
of
bridegrooms
and
not
merely
carried
out
his
wishes
without
announcing
it
to
her
she
could
scarcely
believe
he
could
think
it
would
not
matter
to
her
but
after
careful
thought
she
was
inclined
to
lay
the
deception
at
her
stepmother
s
door
and
she
was
not
long
in
fathoming
the
true
reason
for
it
van
rensselaer
knew
her
unhappy
state
of
mind
and
probably
feared
that
dawn
would
rebel
against
being
married
to
have
her
remain
at
home
was
the
worst
possible
thing
that
could
happen
to
her
dawn
knew
for
from
childhood
she
had
been
hated
by
the
woman
who
had
taken
her
outraged
mother
s
place
it
was
all
quite
but
one
thing
how
had
harrington
winthrop
been
turned
aside
from
his
purpose
of
marrying
her
had
he
done
it
of
himself
or
had
her
father
found
out
something
about
him
that
he
did
not
like
or
had
charles
managed
it
for
her
and
where
was
harrington
would
she
ever
meet
him
again
the
thought
took
such
hold
upon
her
that
it
visited
her
in
dreams
and
made
her
cry
out
in
alarm
as
she
sought
to
hide
from
his
pursuing
phantom
after
her
experience
with
silas
dobson
daniel
was
ever
vigilant
attending
her
to
and
from
school
albeit
seldom
alone
with
her
he
seemed
to
be
entirely
willing
that
his
favorite
followers
should
share
his
privileges
of
her
company
and
often
there
were
several
tiny
girls
or
older
ones
in
the
triumphal
procession
going
to
and
from
the
red
taking
teacher
home
daniel
showed
himself
a
gentle
giant
toward
the
little
ones
too
picking
them
up
when
they
fell
down
wiping
off
the
mud
and
carrying
them
if
they
were
tired
dawn
saw
him
daily
growing
more
manly
and
kindly
and
she
felt
proud
of
him
perhaps
some
day
he
might
become
something
like
charles
though
never
quite
so
cultured
for
he
lacked
the
refined
home
training
but
she
realized
more
and
more
that
he
was
a
good
boy
and
a
great
comfort
to
her
as
for
herself
she
felt
years
older
than
he
and
far
beyond
him
in
experience
she
never
dreamed
how
it
was
with
him
toward
her
if
she
had
she
might
have
given
up
in
despair
and
cried
out
that
there
was
nothing
good
for
her
in
the
world
so
daniel
continued
to
guard
her
and
to
watch
the
movements
of
silas
dobson
as
a
cat
watches
a
mouse
if
silas
had
wished
he
would
have
had
no
opportunity
to
repeat
his
troublesome
attentions
for
whenever
he
found
himself
in
the
neighborhood
of
where
the
teacher
happened
to
be
boarding
he
was
likely
to
notice
daniel
in
the
immediate
foreground
so
the
long
winter
went
pleasantly
by
there
were
husking
bees
quiltings
and
lyceum
nights
dawn
became
a
prominent
participant
at
all
in
no
voice
was
so
clear
as
hers
and
she
could
take
the
high
notes
to
the
envy
of
every
other
soprano
in
the
village
at
the
lyceum
her
readings
were
more
popular
than
any
others
in
spite
of
her
frequent
loneliness
and
her
feeling
of
being
cast
off
by
all
who
should
naturally
protect
it
was
her
own
fault
of
course
that
she
had
run
away
and
she
blamed
no
had
never
been
quite
so
happy
in
her
life
her
hours
were
pleasantly
employed
she
had
friends
who
admired
her
and
she
might
do
as
she
pleased
it
opened
a
wide
and
interesting
life
before
her
if
only
there
had
not
been
that
ache
as
of
something
lost
that
memory
of
her
one
beautiful
day
of
love
which
remained
as
a
haunting
vision
she
would
have
felt
herself
blest
beyond
most
girls
but
all
the
time
there
was
that
sense
of
something
wrong
that
could
not
be
set
right
of
a
great
mistake
that
might
not
ever
be
mended
and
then
one
morning
when
a
hint
of
spring
was
in
the
air
and
the
snow
was
all
gone
save
lingering
patches
in
dark
corners
and
in
shady
hollows
and
the
sunshine
was
making
everybody
feel
glad
she
came
face
to
face
with
harrington
winthrop
chapter
xxi
it
was
in
front
of
the
golden
swan
that
she
met
harrington
he
was
just
coming
down
the
steps
and
must
have
arrived
the
night
before
he
stopped
suddenly
with
the
look
in
his
eyes
like
a
cat
s
when
she
spies
a
bird
and
crouching
steals
slowly
nearer
dawn
paused
for
just
an
instant
too
in
wild
dismay
having
the
instinct
to
flee
yet
realizing
that
she
must
not
because
the
whole
town
would
think
it
strange
she
wished
to
have
the
power
to
pass
him
unrecognized
yet
with
sudden
sinking
of
soul
she
knew
that
she
had
not
his
eye
had
met
hers
with
recognition
and
she
must
hold
her
position
courageously
she
wished
she
knew
all
the
circumstances
of
his
giving
her
up
and
it
flashed
across
her
that
she
must
not
let
him
know
that
she
was
ignorant
of
them
he
must
have
no
advantage
for
his
strange
power
over
her
might
crush
her
in
spite
of
herself
something
tightened
round
her
heart
and
gripped
it
like
a
vise
as
his
cold
calculating
glance
looked
her
over
and
a
cruel
satisfaction
settled
about
his
hateful
mouth
dawn
gave
a
sort
of
gasp
and
started
on
summoning
all
the
spirit
with
which
she
had
vanquished
silas
dobson
and
wondering
why
she
could
not
be
as
haughty
and
as
brave
now
the
sight
of
daniel
s
clad
shoulders
in
the
distance
waiting
at
the
corner
with
a
group
of
other
boys
gave
her
courage
but
her
face
was
white
and
she
felt
her
limbs
trembling
beneath
her
but
harrington
winthrop
did
not
intend
to
let
her
slip
through
his
fingers
thus
easily
now
that
he
had
found
her
apparently
far
from
her
natural
guardians
he
of
course
knew
nothing
of
her
marriage
with
his
brother
he
hastened
down
the
steps
with
effusive
manner
and
smiling
countenance
and
extended
his
hand
in
a
warm
anything
he
ever
did
could
be
said
to
be
actually
warm
i
did
not
expect
this
pleasure
he
said
in
an
oily
voice
and
with
an
impressive
glance
intended
to
convey
deep
emotion
she
drew
back
from
the
hand
he
offered
and
wished
she
could
take
her
eyes
from
his
hateful
ones
but
she
could
not
poor
child
he
murmured
in
mock
pity
they
have
told
you
terrible
untruths
about
me
and
you
have
suffered
and
find
it
hard
to
forgive
but
indeed
it
was
none
of
my
fault
i
will
explain
the
whole
matter
and
we
can
still
evade
the
enemies
who
are
trying
to
part
us
and
be
happy
together
dawn
shuddered
where
can
we
go
that
we
shall
not
be
interrupted
suppose
we
walk
in
the
woods
dawn
was
filled
with
terror
she
looked
about
wildly
and
saw
to
her
relief
that
daniel
with
his
special
bodyguard
in
the
rear
was
sauntering
slowly
toward
her
his
attitude
of
protection
gave
her
courage
he
was
watching
the
stranger
with
a
curious
suspicion
had
his
intuition
told
him
that
she
needed
help
daniel
was
but
a
few
steps
away
she
drew
her
breath
in
quickly
and
spoke
in
a
clear
voice
i
have
no
time
to
talk
with
any
one
at
present
i
am
on
my
way
to
school
and
shall
be
busy
until
late
in
the
afternoon
i
am
a
teacher
she
drew
herself
up
with
dignity
and
he
realized
that
she
was
not
the
simple
child
he
had
seen
last
but
a
woman
with
an
independence
of
her
own
dismiss
your
school
he
said
in
the
voice
he
was
used
to
having
obeyed
i
can
not
possibly
wait
until
this
afternoon
i
must
talk
with
you
at
once
i
don
t
intend
to
let
you
slip
through
my
fingers
so
easily
now
that
i
have
found
you
my
pretty
lady
he
smiled
but
there
was
a
sinister
menace
in
his
voice
it
is
impossible
to
dismiss
school
said
dawn
decidedly
i
should
lose
my
position
if
i
did
a
thing
like
that
besides
i
do
not
wish
to
talk
with
you
there
is
nothing
to
talk
about
there
is
everything
to
talk
about
said
the
man
a
fierce
light
coming
into
his
eyes
they
have
told
you
lies
about
me
and
taken
you
away
from
me
but
i
mean
to
have
you
in
spite
of
them
i
will
explain
to
you
all
about
that
poor
woman
she
was
never
my
wife
at
all
come
let
the
school
take
care
of
itself
you
will
have
no
further
need
of
it
you
belong
to
me
and
i
will
take
care
of
you
come
with
me
the
last
word
was
a
command
and
with
it
he
took
hold
of
her
shoulder
almost
roughly
and
attempted
to
turn
her
round
at
once
there
was
a
low
growl
behind
his
heels
and
daniel
butterworth
s
dog
took
hold
of
the
calf
of
his
leg
as
if
he
too
would
say
come
with
me
harrington
promptly
let
go
of
dawn
who
took
advantage
of
her
freedom
and
fairly
flew
down
the
street
leaving
daniel
to
settle
up
matters
between
his
dog
and
the
stranger
in
whose
frightened
antics
the
boy
was
secretly
taking
deep
delight
when
dawn
had
turned
the
corner
and
was
out
of
sight
dan
called
the
dog
off
then
harrington
winthrop
discovered
that
his
lady
had
departed
before
that
time
he
had
been
otherwise
occupied
angry
baffled
and
exhausted
he
was
in
nowise
attractive
an
interested
group
of
boys
and
one
or
two
little
girls
who
had
torn
themselves
away
from
the
teacher
s
side
encircled
him
dan
looked
at
him
in
quiet
amusement
and
then
called
his
dog
and
betook
himself
to
school
most
of
the
group
followed
him
with
reluctant
glances
back
at
the
dishevelled
stranger
one
little
girl
lingered
eying
him
wonderingly
and
twisting
her
where
is
your
little
girl
asked
harrington
sharply
the
child
felt
compelled
to
answer
round
that
there
corner
over
there
and
down
the
road
a
good
piece
harrington
glanced
after
the
boys
and
the
dog
uncertainly
did
the
dog
go
to
school
also
where
does
your
teacher
board
he
asked
again
she
s
boardin
round
an
it
s
ann
peabody
s
turn
this
week
she
s
got
a
boy
what
s
blind
in
one
eye
ah
indeed
that
s
a
pity
where
does
ann
peabody
live
next
door
but
one
to
the
church
the
house
with
by
the
gate
an
a
laylock
bush
by
the
stoop
thank
you
now
tell
me
what
time
your
school
lets
out
that
s
a
little
lady
it
don
t
let
out
till
four
o
it
ll
be
took
up
fore
i
get
there
if
i
don
t
hurry
she
took
to
her
heels
forthwith
and
harrington
winthrop
limped
up
the
steps
of
the
golden
swan
to
repair
damages
and
consider
his
next
line
of
procedure
when
dawn
arrived
at
the
she
was
almost
too
frightened
to
stop
it
was
late
and
most
of
the
scholars
were
there
they
trooped
gladly
in
after
her
she
had
made
school
for
them
a
kind
of
picnic
and
they
were
eager
to
begin
it
even
after
she
had
hung
up
her
bonnet
and
cape
and
opened
the
high
lid
of
her
desk
her
heart
was
beating
like
a
now
and
then
she
looked
apprehensively
toward
the
door
and
was
reassured
when
at
last
she
saw
daniel
saunter
in
with
a
comfortable
smile
on
his
face
while
the
dog
took
up
his
station
on
the
rags
often
came
to
school
it
was
a
part
of
his
privilege
to
guard
the
teacher
and
he
felt
he
had
earned
a
morning
session
by
his
gallantry
in
defending
her
against
the
rude
stranger
who
had
dared
to
lay
hands
upon
her
he
sat
down
comfortably
just
inside
the
door
his
forepaws
hanging
over
the
step
but
he
kept
his
head
erect
with
his
nose
on
his
paws
and
one
eye
closed
not
once
during
the
morning
did
he
relax
he
felt
that
there
was
further
trouble
to
be
expected
and
he
must
be
ready
dawn
smiled
albeit
with
trembling
lips
and
set
about
the
morning
s
routine
but
her
mind
was
troubled
and
she
kept
starting
and
glancing
uneasily
toward
the
door
daniel
saw
this
and
grew
grave
with
apprehension
what
had
the
stranger
to
do
with
the
teacher
and
why
did
she
seem
to
be
so
uneasy
had
he
some
power
over
her
she
certainly
did
not
look
happy
when
he
had
laid
his
hand
upon
her
arm
just
before
he
dan
had
given
that
low
signal
to
rags
she
couldn
t
have
liked
the
stranger
to
be
there
or
she
would
not
have
run
away
when
she
got
the
chance
at
recess
she
made
daniel
happy
by
calling
him
to
the
desk
and
in
a
low
tone
thanking
him
for
helping
her
she
did
not
explain
further
than
to
say
that
the
man
was
an
old
acquaintance
whom
she
did
not
like
daniel
understood
him
to
be
in
the
same
class
with
silas
dobson
during
the
morning
session
of
school
dawn
s
mind
was
in
a
whirl
trying
to
think
what
she
should
do
she
dreaded
the
coming
of
the
afternoon
when
school
would
close
and
she
must
go
back
to
peabody
s
house
winthrop
would
certainly
search
her
out
it
had
been
a
great
mistake
to
let
him
know
she
was
the
for
though
he
did
not
know
her
assumed
name
he
could
easily
find
her
now
she
dreaded
any
encounter
with
him
a
frenzy
of
fear
had
taken
possession
of
her
as
the
morning
went
on
she
tried
to
make
some
plan
for
escape
no
longer
was
it
safe
in
this
vicinity
she
must
get
away
and
hide
from
him
where
could
she
ever
hope
to
evade
a
man
who
spent
his
entire
time
travelling
over
the
earth
he
had
the
assurance
of
the
devil
himself
and
it
was
almost
hopeless
to
try
to
get
beyond
his
grasp
nevertheless
she
must
go
the
reading
class
which
recited
just
before
the
stumbled
on
its
way
for
once
without
correction
while
dawn
planned
her
next
pitiful
move
at
noon
she
sent
one
of
the
older
girls
to
peabody
s
to
get
her
bag
and
a
few
little
things
that
were
lying
about
the
room
she
usually
kept
everything
neatly
packed
in
a
large
bag
she
had
except
her
silk
dress
which
was
hung
on
a
nail
this
the
girl
promised
to
fold
nicely
and
put
into
the
bag
she
was
to
tell
peabody
that
dawn
had
decided
to
go
a
day
before
the
time
was
up
and
to
thank
the
lady
for
all
her
kindness
and
say
dawn
was
sorry
she
could
not
very
well
leave
to
explain
it
herself
the
girl
felt
honored
by
the
commission
and
performed
it
to
the
letter
wishing
the
while
that
she
knew
where
teacher
was
going
a
day
ahead
of
time
and
resolving
to
ask
her
mother
to
invite
the
teacher
to
come
to
their
house
ahead
of
time
too
rags
took
up
his
station
on
the
steps
again
for
the
afternoon
session
having
been
abundantly
fed
from
the
generous
on
doughnuts
and
chicken
bones
rags
felt
it
in
the
air
that
something
was
going
to
happen
but
nothing
did
and
four
o
clock
came
at
last
dawn
had
made
the
scholars
write
in
their
during
the
last
hour
of
the
afternoon
command
you
may
your
mind
from
play
straggled
up
and
down
a
whole
page
in
many
of
the
books
while
blots
grew
thick
among
the
words
but
no
teacher
wandered
alertly
up
and
down
the
aisles
to
watch
and
to
correct
blessed
honor
sit
down
and
hold
the
quill
pen
or
better
still
take
the
dirty
little
fist
of
the
writer
into
her
own
pink
hand
and
guide
the
writing
the
teacher
sat
behind
a
raised
diligently
writing
and
took
no
heed
of
notes
or
whittling
or
even
paper
balls
daniel
butterworth
finally
took
bug
higginson
by
the
collar
and
stood
him
up
behind
the
stove
but
still
the
teacher
wrote
on
it
was
a
letter
to
the
minister
she
was
writing
and
her
young
breast
heaved
with
mingled
emotions
is
she
wrote
it
was
hard
to
have
to
leave
this
first
school
where
she
had
been
so
happy
and
where
she
could
still
be
so
happy
if
she
only
had
some
one
to
protect
her
from
the
man
who
would
probably
haunt
her
through
life
she
had
felt
that
she
must
make
some
brief
explanation
of
her
departure
to
the
kind
old
man
who
had
trusted
her
and
upon
whom
it
would
fall
to
explain
her
absence
dear
mercer
she
wrote
you
have
been
so
very
kind
to
me
that
it
gives
me
much
sorrow
to
tell
you
that
i
must
go
away
something
has
happened
that
makes
it
necessary
for
me
to
go
away
at
once
i
can
not
even
wait
to
say
to
you
or
any
one
else
i

so
sorry
for
i

very
happy
here

i
have
tried

very
gratefully
mary
montgomery
after
folding
addressing
and
sealing
this
letter
she
closed
her
desk
then
with
sudden
thought
as
she
caught
daniel
s
troubled
eyes
upon
her
she
opened
it
again
and
wrote
hastily
dear
daniel
i
am
having
to
go
away
in
a
great
hurry
i
can
not
say
to
anybody
but
i
must
thank
you
for
all
you
have
done
for
me
i
thank
you
more
than
words

ever
tell
you
can
not
know
how
hard
it
is
for
me
to
go
away
from
the
school
please
study
hard
and
try
to
be
a
good
boy
and
then
some
day
when
i

of
what
a
great
man
you
are
i
shall
be
so
proud
to
have
been
your
teacher

to
college
daniel
and
be
as
great
a
man
as
you
can
and
don
t
forget
that
you
have
helped
me
very
very
much
ever
since
i
came
here
your
grateful
teacher
her
hand
trembled
as
she
sealed
this
other
note
she
closed
the
desk
hastily
and
glanced
at
the
clock
it
was
one
minute
after
closing
time
bug
higginson
was
decorating
the
stove
with
a
caricature
of
one
of
the
selectmen
it
all
looked
so
homely
and
familiar
and
dear
and
she
was
to
see
it
no
more
the
tears
sprang
to
her
eyes
and
she
could
scarcely
control
her
voice
to
dismiss
the
school
she
shook
her
head
and
tried
to
smile
when
the
girls
asked
if
they
might
wait
for
her
to
walk
home
telling
them
she
must
stay
a
little
while
that
she
had
something
to
do
they
all
filed
out
save
daniel
who
sat
quietly
in
his
seat
watching
her
with
sad
puzzled
eyes
daniel
had
seen
the
glint
of
a
tear
as
she
looked
at
them
aren
t
you
going
home
daniel
she
asked
she
was
dreading
momentarily
the
approach
of
harrington
winthrop
she
seemed
to
know
he
would
come
to
walk
home
with
her
so
did
rags
who
sat
very
stiff
and
straight
on
the
with
bristling
ears
and
eyes
alert
don
t
you
want
i
should
stay
asked
daniel
and
his
eyes
hinted
that
he
understood
she
was
in
trouble
oh
no
thank
you
daniel
she
said
trying
to
make
her
voice
sound
cheery
and
natural
but
somehow
it
broke
into
almost
a
sob
daniel
eyed
her
curiously
for
a
moment
and
then
got
up
slowly
from
his
desk
and
went
out
he
gave
rags
a
look
as
he
passed
the
boy
and
the
dog
thoroughly
understood
each
other
rags
did
not
stir
daniel
went
down
the
path
and
out
to
the
road
then
down
the
road
a
few
paces
after
which
he
climbed
the
fence
back
into
the
then
he
walked
over
to
a
log
behind
the
and
sat
down
where
he
could
watch
the
road
to
the
village
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
dawn
looked
about
her
caught
her
breath
a
moment
and
seemed
to
bid
to
all
the
childish
forms
that
had
but
a
few
minutes
before
occupied
the
now
empty
benches
then
spying
rags
still
sitting
in
the
doorway
she
took
the
note
she
had
written
to
daniel
and
going
over
to
the
dog
tied
it
around
his
neck
with
a
bit
of
string
rags
got
up
and
wagged
his
tail
glancing
eagerly
at
her
then
back
to
the
road
again
dawn
patted
him
lovingly
take
that
note
to
dan
rags
she
commanded
rags
barked
questioningly
he
wanted
to
tell
her
that
he
had
been
ordered
to
stay
with
her
but
she
did
not
seem
to
understand
he
wagged
his
tail
harder
but
he
did
not
budge
go
rags
good
dog
take
that
to
dan
she
pointed
out
the
door
rags
cast
a
protesting
anxious
bark
at
her
a
furtive
glance
down
the
empty
road
and
hustled
out
the
door
he
reasoned
that
dan
was
near
at
hand
and
must
settle
the
confliction
of
duties
himself
he
could
not
but
obey
the
one
whom
he
and
his
master
alike
worshipped
the
minute
the
dog
had
gone
dawn
put
on
her
bonnet
caught
up
her
cape
and
bag
and
slipped
out
of
the
door
and
around
the
on
the
side
farthest
from
the
village
she
fled
through
the
back
yard
crept
under
the
lower
rail
of
the
fence
and
proceeded
over
into
the
meadow
where
they
had
coasted
all
winter
in
a
moment
more
she
was
out
of
sight
down
the
hill
she
had
but
to
cross
the
log
which
formed
a
bridge
across
the
brook
and
she
would
enter
the
woods
that
lay
at
the
foot
of
wintergreen
hill
there
she
would
be
safe
and
could
get
away
without
seen
by
any
one
daniel
cut
the
string
which
held
the
note
and
sent
the
dog
back
to
his
post
while
he
slowly
unfolded
it
and
read
his
hands
trembling
at
the
thought
that
she
had
written
and
sealed
it
and
that
it
was
for
him
a
great
tumult
of
emotions
went
through
his
big
immature
heart
as
he
tried
to
take
it
in
he
had
known
something
would
happen
and
was
glad
he
had
not
gone
away
rags
hustled
back
to
the
steps
but
instantly
he
knew
something
was
wrong
he
looked
into
the
empty
room
she
was
not
there
he
smelled
his
way
up
to
the
desk
but
could
not
bring
her
into
existence
he
snuffed
his
way
out
to
the
steps
and
down
the
path
in
a
hurry
then
came
back
baffled
with
short
sharp
worried
barks
to
hunt
for
the
scent
again
snuff
snuff
snuff
bark
rags
could
not
understand
it
it
was
the
scent
snuff
snuff
snuff
bark
bark
he
tried
it
over
again
to
make
sure
the
scent
went
around
the
left
of
the
through
the
girl
s
what
could
she
have
gone
around
there
for
at
this
time
of
day
had
the
enemy
come
during
his
absence
and
stolen
her
away
rags
hurried
around
the
school
snuffing
and
barking
scuttled
under
the
fence
in
a
hurry
and
away
down
the
hill
his
bark
growing
more
sure
and
relieved
every
minute
daniel
was
not
accustomed
to
receiving
letters
he
grasped
the
meaning
of
that
first
sentence
slowly
having
lingered
long
over
the
dear
daniel
but
he
got
no
further
than
the
first
sentence
i
am
having
to
go
away
in
a
great
hurry
he
got
to
his
feet
rapidly
and
went
around
to
the
door
a
great
fear
was
in
his
heart
the
absence
of
rags
confirmed
it
he
entered
the
deserted
no
one
was
there
he
stepped
up
to
the
teacher
s
desk
a
letter
addressed
to
the
minister
lay
there
daniel
stood
still
by
the
teacher
s
desk
his
heart
filled
with
foreboding
and
read
the
remainder
of
his
own
letter
as
he
finished
he
heard
a
step
outside
the
door
and
looking
up
saw
the
stranger
of
the
morning
before
him
instinctively
he
reached
out
for
the
minister
s
letter
on
the
desk
and
put
it
with
his
own
into
his
then
he
faced
the
intruder
quietly
and
something
in
his
steady
blue
eyes
reminded
the
man
of
his
morning
encounter
with
the
dog
he
felt
that
he
had
an
enemy
in
the
boy
before
him
winthrop
took
off
his
hat
and
inquired
suavely
is
miss
van
rensselaer
here
this
is
the
isn
t
it
it
s
the
all
right
answered
dan
but
there
ain
t
no
miss
van
rensselaer
round
don
t
know
no
such
person
you
must
a
ben
told
wrong
oh
no
i
saw
her
this
morning
in
fact
she
must
have
expected
me
i
refer
to
the
teacher
of
this
school
the
teacher
s
miss
mary
she
s
gone
she
boards
this
week
with
the
peabodys
up
by
the
church
second
house
beyond
she
hasn
t
been
gone
from
here
five
minutes
that
is
very
strange
said
the
visitor
i
just
walked
down
past
the
church
and
did
not
meet
her
she
sometimes
stops
a
minute
to
see
how
the
blacksmith
s
little
sick
girl
is
at
the
corner
here
she
might
a
gone
there
but
she
never
stays
long
you
d
best
go
right
up
to
peabody
s
daniel
was
anxious
to
get
rid
of
the
man
and
he
was
certain
that
the
teacher
had
not
gone
in
the
direction
of
the
peabodys
for
he
had
watched
the
road
every
minute
until
he
came
around
to
the
front
of
the
school
harrington
winthrop
took
himself
away
with
a
baffled
look
on
his
imperious
face
as
soon
as
he
had
passed
from
sight
dan
reconnoitred
the
there
was
no
sign
of
anybody
he
listened
but
could
not
hear
the
dog
he
gave
a
long
low
whistle
and
instantly
from
the
distance
toward
the
woods
he
heard
a
faint
sharp
bark
in
answer
he
whistled
again
and
again
came
the
dog
s
response
daniel
was
over
the
fence
in
a
second
and
down
the
hill
not
whistling
again
until
he
reached
the
log
across
the
brook
then
the
dog
s
bark
was
nearer
but
it
ended
suddenly
as
if
some
one
was
holding
his
muzzle
the
boy
thought
he
understood
and
bounded
rapidly
toward
the
place
from
which
the
sound
seemed
to
have
come
in
a
moment
more
he
had
plunged
into
the
darkness
of
the
woods
chapter
xxii
daniel
found
dawn
huddled
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
behind
a
thicket
of
laurel
with
her
bag
beside
her
and
tears
on
her
frightened
face
the
dog
had
broken
away
from
her
and
met
him
with
a
joyous
bark
wagging
his
tail
and
running
back
and
forth
between
them
his
ragged
hairy
body
wriggling
joyously
for
had
he
not
both
of
them
here
together
far
away
from
intruding
strangers
why
should
not
all
be
well
now
oh
daniel
said
dawn
in
a
voice
that
was
almost
a
sob
why
did
you
come
after
me
i
had
to
said
dan
looking
almost
sullen
i
couldn
t
let
you
come
off
alone
besides
you
don
t
need
to
go
we
won
t
let
anybody
hurt
you
i
can
knock
that
fellow
into
the
middle
of
next
week
if
you
say
the
word
but
the
trouble
was
not
lifted
from
her
face
you
are
very
good
and
i
thank
you
more
than
i
can
ever
tell
she
answered
him
but
i
must
go
away
he
is
a
bad
man
and
he
thinks
he
has
some
power
over
me
it
would
be
of
no
use
for
you
to
knock
him
into
next
week
for
he
would
be
on
hand
again
the
next
week
to
deal
with
he
would
tell
the
minister
and
everybody
that
he
had
a
right
to
take
me
away
and
they
would
all
believe
him
he
can
make
wrong
things
seem
right
to
people
he
has
done
it
before
i
m
afraid
of
him
i
never
expected
to
meet
him
here
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
get
away
where
he
can
t
find
me
i
must
get
away
at
once
or
he
may
follow
me
will
you
please
take
rags
and
go
back
now
and
will
you
take
a
letter
that
i
left
in
the
to
the
minister
i
am
so
sorry
to
go
this
way
but
it
can
not
be
helped
i
must
get
away
from
that
man
is
he
any
right
began
daniel
lamely
and
then
burst
out
i
mean
is
he
anything
to
kind
of
relation
you
know
nothing
in
the
world
i
m
thankful
to
say
and
he
never
shall
be
as
long
as
i
live
but
i
never
could
feel
safe
again
now
that
he
knows
where
i
am
dan
stood
puzzled
and
troubled
say
don
t
you
know
how
you
re
going
to
make
all
the
school
feel
bad
if
you
go
this
way
the
little
ones
ll
wait
for
you
morning
and
they
ll
go
there
to
the
school
and
you
won
t
be
there
we
never
had
a
teacher
that
made
everybody
like
to
study
before
you
oughtn
t
to
go
this
way
you
go
he
stopped
choking
dawn
looked
at
him
a
moment
the
tears
gathering
anew
in
her
own
eyes
then
suddenly
down
went
her
head
in
her
hands
and
she
cried
as
if
her
heart
would
break
oh
daniel
she
said
please
don
t
i
don
t
want
to
go
i
shall
never
be
as
happy
again
i
know
and
you
have
been
so
good
to
me
but
i
the
big
boy
went
down
on
his
knees
beside
her
then
and
put
his
rough
hand
reverently
on
hers
don
t
said
he
don
t
i
ve
to
tell
you
something
perhaps
you
won
t
like

t

as
much
as

but
i

study
hard
and
go
to

and

just
to

t
go

if

just
stay
here
and
let
me
take
care
of
you
i
love
you
and
i
don
t
care
who

i
ve
been
feeling
that
way
about

all
winter
only
i
thought
perhaps

d
like
me
better
when
i
got
more
education
but
now
you
see
i
ve
just
got
to
tell
you
how
it

t
you
like
me
enough
to
stay
and
let
me
take
care
of
you
i
love
you
but
dawn
interrupted
him
with
a
moan
oh
daniel
you
too
then
i
haven
t
got
anybody
left
not
a
friend
in
all
the
world
she
sobbed
afresh
daniel
dropped
down
on
the
moss
beside
her
in
dismay
his
heart
grew
heavy
as
lead
within
him
and
the
world
suddenly
looked
blank
yes
you
have
he
said
i
ll
be
your
friend
if
you
won
t
let
me
be
anything
else
i
was
afraid
it
would
make
you
mad
he
spoke
hopelessly
i
ain
t
good
enough
fer
you
i
know
but
i
m
strong
an
i
d
study
hard
and
get

for
you
all
my
life
but
i
might
a
known

wouldn
t
think
i
was
good
enough
he
broke
off
helplessly
and
she
saw
that
his
broad
chest
was
heaving
painfully
and
that
his
usually
smiling
lips
were
quivering
she
put
out
her
hand
and
laid
it
gently
on
his
dear
daniel
she
said
listen
it
isn
t
that
at
all
he
caught
the
cool
little
hand
and
pressed
it
against
his
eyes
that
were
burning
hot
with
boyish
tears
he
was
ashamed
to
shed
it
was
years
since
tears
had
been
in
those
eyes
he
had
almost
forgotten
the
smart
of
them
he
had
scorned
the
thought
of
them
even
in
his
babyhood
yet
here
just
when
he
longed
to
be
a
man
they
came
to
make
his
shame
complete
listen
dan
said
dawn
earnestly
it
isn
t
that
at
all
you

good
and
dear
enough
for
anybody
and
i
do
love
you
too
for

very
good
to
me
i
love
you
for

i
m

so
sorry

bad
about
it
but
you
see
how
it
is
i
to
some
one
else
first

it
he
blurted
out
fiercely
oh
no
dan
oh
no
i
m
very
very
thankful
it
isn
t
that
man
if
it
were
i
should
die
i
couldn
t
love
him
you
wouldn
t
think
i
could
there
was
silence
in
the
quiet
woods
for
a
moment
it
ain
t
sile
dobson
he
asked
fearfully
at
last
dawn
s
laugh
burst
out
softly
then
oh
dan
you
know
better
than
that
you
knew
without
asking
how
could
any
one
love
him
no
dan
the
one

belong
to
is
fine
and
grand
and
he
ought
to
be
then
why
doesn
t
he
take
care
of
you
burst
forth
dan
indignantly
i
wouldn
t
let
you
teach
school
if
you
belonged
to
me
and
i
wouldn
t
let
that
fellow
frighten
you
he
can
t
be
all
you
say
or
he
d
take
care
of
you
dawn
s
cheeks
were
very
red
he
doesn
t
know
where
i
am
she
said
softly
i
went
away
it
was
for
a
good
reason
it
was
for
his
sake
i
had
to
go
things
had
happened
i
can
t
tell
you
about
it
but
it
would
have
made
him
trouble
if
i
had
stayed
dan
sat
looking
at
her
steadily
a
great
wistful
yearning
in
his
eyes
i
guess
you
re
wrong
bout
that
he
said
thoughtfully
i
guess
he
d
rather
have
you
the
trouble
than
to
have
no
trouble
without
you
leastways
i
would
an
ef
he
don
t
love
you
that
way
he
ain
t
much
account
a
troubled
look
came
into
dawn
s
eyes
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
questioned
from
charles
s
standpoint
the
wisdom
of
her
running
way
it
would
have
made
a
lot
of
trouble
all
around
she
said
shaking
her
head
doubtfully
say
look
here
said
dan
sitting
up
suddenly
you
tell
me
where
that
fellow
is
an
i
ll
go
tell
him
all
about
you
and
how
that
other
fellow
is
worrying
you
and
how
you
need
him
to
take
care
o
you
an
then
if
he
don
t
seem
to
want
to
find
you
and
look
out
for
you
why
i
won
t
tell
him
where
you
are
i
ll
come
back
and
take
care
of
you
myself
any
way
you
needn
t
like
me
nor
anything
if
you
don
t
want
to
but
i
ain
t
going
to
stand
having
you
off
running
around
the
world
frightened
of
that
fellow
all
the
time
not
if
i
have
to
chop
him
up
myself
i
tell
you
i
you
dan
s
blue
eyes
were
flashing
and
his
cheeks
were
red
with
determination
he
had
let
go
of
her
hand
as
if
it
were
a
gracious
favor
she
had
bestowed
upon
him
for
the
moment
in
his
dire
distress
and
he
had
no
right
to
keep
it
but
dawn
put
it
out
again
and
laid
it
on
his
gently
daniel
you
are
my
dear
friend
for
always
and
i
am
glad
to
feel
that
you
would
take
care
of
me
if
you
could
but
truly
there
is
nothing
you
can
do
i
would
not
have
you
go
to
him
for
the
world
he
must
not
know
where
i
am
nor
be
troubled
ever
by
any
thought
of
me
it
was
for
that
i
came
away
you
would
grieve
me
more
than
i
can
tell
you
if
you
did
i
want
him
to
forget
me
because
it
could
only
make
him
trouble
if
he
found
me
he
would
to
come
to
me
he
would
want
to
come

don
t
understand
of
course
and
i
mustn
t
tell
you
any
more
only
there
is
nothing
can
be
done
but
for
me
to
go
away
and
find
a
place
somewhere
where
no
one
can
find
me
then
people
will
forget
and
i
shall
not
bring

trouble
or
disgrace
on

at
all
my
fault
she
added
i

breath

strange

know
anything
about
it
i
don
t
need
to
talk
to
you
i
can
keep
far
enough
away
to
see
that
no
one
hurts
you
till

a
good
safe
place
but
dan
the
folks
at
your
home
they
would
think

gone
away
together
i
do
not
want
them
to
think
wrong
of
me
even
if
i
m
not
there
to
bear
it
dan
was
baffled
he
saw
at
once
that
it
would
not
do
he
must
go
back
and
bear
the
loneliness
and
the
thought
of
her
fighting
her
own
battles
well
i
ll
go
with
you
now
any
way
he
said
at
last
with
determination

to
some
coach
somewhere
an
come

in
the
night

to
my
room
without

she
never

about
me

more
an
don
t
stay

to
listen
for
me
she

never

i
helped

your
bag
across
country
to
cherry
valley

or
somewhere
i
ve
got
the
parson
s
letter
here
in
my
pocket
that
villain
came
to
the
after
you
an
i
picked
up
the
letter
so
he
wouldn
t
see
it
oh
did
he
come
to
the
school
after
me
then
perhaps
he
has
followed
us
dan
i
must
go
quickly
come
on
said
dan
as
though
he
were
proposing
to
walk
to
his
death
at
least
he
was
not
to
leave
her
yet
he
picked
up
her
bag
and
helped
her
to
her
feet
then
still
holding
the
hand
by
which
he
had
helped
her
up
he
bent
over
and
kissed
it
reverently
then
he
straightened
up
with
a
royal
look
of
manhood
in
his
eyes
and
turned
to
her
you
won
t
mind
that
just
once
will
you
that
hand
did
a
whole
lot
fer
me
beginning
when
it
gave
me
that
first
licking
dawn
smiled
sadly
then
with
sudden
impulse
she
reached
up
caught
his
face
between
her
hands
drew
it
down
to
her
own
and
gently
seriously
kissed
him
upon
the
forehead
as
if
it
were
a
sacred
rite
i
love
you
dan
she
said
i
m
so
sorry
it
can
t
be
the
kind
of
love
you
want
but
i
ll
be
your
dear
friend
always
i
never
had
a
brother
perhaps
i
might
call
you
my
brother
it
would
be
nice
to
have
a
brother
like
you
you
have
been
very
good
to
me
and
i
shall
never
forget
it
dan
looked
at
her
as
if
she
had
laid
a
benediction
upon
him
after
all
he
was
young
and
it
was
much
to
have
her
friendship
and
if
another
had
her
love
at
least
he
daniel
was
on
the
spot
and
might
help
her
now
which
went
a
great
way
toward
making
him
feel
better
about
the
other
fellow
the
boy
had
begun
to
have
a
lurking
pity
for
him
besides
and
who
was
he
daniel
that
he
should
hope
to
hold
a
girl
like
this
for
himself
it
was
much
that
he
had
known
her
it
was
right
that
she
should
have
a
lover
such
as
she
had
fine
and
grand
and
noble
almost
the
great
heart
of
the
felt
he
could
take
them
both
in
and
care
for
them
and
bring
them
together
knew
they
hurried
through
the
woods
the
boy
directing
the
way
now
and
she
depending
upon
him
he
decided
that
it
would
be
well
for
her
to
take
a
certain
stage
line
that
could
be
reached
only
by
a
good
walk
of
several
miles
across
the
country
he
knew
the
way
and
she
was
only
too
glad
to
have
a
guide
that
was
dan
s
great
day
of
happiness
for
years
afterward
he
remembered
every
little
incident
he
seemed
to
know
while
it
was
all
happening
that
it
was
a
special
gift
granted
him
in
view
of
the
sorrow
and
sacrifice
he
must
pass
through
his
was
no
passing
love
of
a
boy
he
realized
that
the
girl
beside
him
was
one
in
a
thousand
and
that
it
was
enough
for
a
lifetime
just
to
have
known
her
and
to
be
able
to
remember
one
such
perfect
afternoon
as
this
to
dawn
it
was
given
to
understand
her
power
for
that
brief
season
and
to
use
it
to
its
utmost
for
the
boy
s
good
she
talked
to
him
earnestly
about
himself
and
his
future
and
urged
him
to
make
the
utmost
of
every
opportunity
she
made
him
understand
that
he
had
the
gift
of
leading
others
and
that
some
day
he
might
take
a
great
stand
in
the
world
for
some
cause
of
right
against
wrong
when
others
would
flock
to
his
standard
and
let
him
lead
them
to
victory
it
was
an
unusual
thing
that
a
girl
like
dawn
should
see
his
possibilities
and
point
him
to
a
great
ambition
but
dawn
was
an
unusual
girl
some
girls
even
though
they
might
have
done
no
real
wrong
would
have
taken
advantage
of
the
boy
s
confessed
love
and
have
coquetted
with
him
dawn
treated
him
with
the
utmost
gentleness
as
if
she
understood
the
pain
she
must
inflict
and
would
fain
give
him
something
fine
to
take
the
place
of
what
he
had
lost
when
they
came
to
a
hill
they
took
hold
of
hands
and
raced
down
when
they
came
to
a
brook
he
helped
her
gravely
across
just
as
he
had
helped
her
ever
since
she
came
to
teach
the
school
he
said
no
more
about
his
love
it
was
understood
between
them
that
it
was
a
closed
incident
to
be
put
away
in
the
sacred
recesses
of
their
hearts
into
the
girl
s
face
had
come
a
tender
womanly
interest
that
for
the
time
being
almost
made
up
to
the
boy
for
the
loss
of
her
it
was
while
they
were
walking
down
a
long
stretch
of
brown
road
straight
into
a
glorious
sunset
that
the
boy
asked
quite
suddenly
has
he
been
to
college
dawn
knew
at
once
whom
he
meant
and
began
simply
to
tell
all
about
charles
it
did
her
good
to
speak
of
him
it
seemed
to
bring
him
nearer
her
face
blossomed
into
sweetness
as
she
talked
there
was
not
much
to
say
not
much
about
him
that
she
could
tell
to
a
stranger
from
her
one
brief
day
s
acquaintance
with
her
husband
yet
she
managed
to
say
a
good
deal
charles
would
have
been
amazed
to
hear
her
describe
his
high
ambitions
and
noble
thoughts
he
did
not
dream
how
well
the
girl
had
read
him
during
their
one
blissful
day
together
and
now
she
was
painting
him
as
an
ideal
for
the
rude
boy
who
walked
beside
her
and
listened
with
his
heart
filled
with
patient
envy
that
presently
lost
its
bitterness
in
pity
for
the
other
one
who
might
have
her
great
love
yet
might
not
walk
beside
her
as
he
was
doing
at
last
dan
broke
in
upon
her
words
tisn
t
right
he
shouldn
t
know
where
you
are
if
he
s
anything
like
what
you
think
he
is
he
s
most
crazy
hunting
you
i
know
how
he
feels
dawn
shook
her
head
sadly
and
told
him
he
did
not
understand
but
his
words
sank
into
her
heart
for
future
meditation
and
she
could
not
quite
get
away
from
the
thought
that
perhaps
she
had
been
wrong
after
all
in
going
away
perhaps
it
might
have
been
more
heroic
to
stay
and
face
the
hard
things
right
where
she
had
been
the
long
spring
twilight
had
almost
faded
into
darkness
as
they
came
at
last
to
the
inn
where
the
coach
would
pass
neither
had
spoken
for
some
time
there
was
upon
them
a
sense
of
their
coming
separation
and
it
depressed
them
already
dawn
was
looking
into
her
lonely
future
and
dreading
to
lose
this
only
friend
she
had
already
dan
was
realizing
what
the
going
back
was
to
be
they
had
arranged
it
all
dan
was
to
take
the
letter
to
the
minister
and
explain
that
he
had
helped
the
teacher
to
catch
a
stage
he
had
taken
it
upon
himself
also
to
carry
messages
to
the
scholars
and
to
her
kind
messages
of
and
haste
and
sorrow
with
the
promise
too
at
dan
s
earnest
solicitation
that
if
she
ever
could
she
would
return
to
them
then
at
the
end
they
had
no
time
for
parting
the
stage
was
just
driving
up
to
the
inn
as
they
reached
there
there
was
no
time
even
for
supper
though
neither
of
them
thought
of
it
at
the
time
dan
put
her
into
the
coach
and
arranged
her
bag
comfortably
but
he
had
to
get
out
at
once
as
others
were
pressing
in
he
went
outside
in
the
dim
light
and
stood
by
her
window
looking
up
trying
to
keep
rags
from
breaking
away
and
getting
into
the
coach
something
in
his
throat
choked
him
he
could
not
speak
the
people
were
all
in
and
the
driver
was
climbing
to
his
place
when
dawn
reached
out
her
hand
and
caught
dan
s
giving
it
a
quick
little
squeeze
dear
dan
she
whispered
as
she
leaned
out
don
t
forget
to
be
the
best
you
can
he
caught
the
little
hand
and
laid
his
lips
against
it
in
the
rags
had
broken
away
and
was
barking
wildly
at
the
coach
door
but
the
horses
started
and
took
dawn
away
from
the
boy
and
the
dog
and
in
a
moment
more
they
stood
alone
in
the
road
looking
down
the
street
at
the
dim
black
speck
in
the
distance
which
was
the
coach
then
slowly
silently
the
one
with
downcast
head
the
other
with
drooping
tail
daniel
and
his
dog
took
their
way
back
over
the
road
they
had
come
so
happily
that
afternoon
the
dog
could
not
understand
and
now
and
then
stopped
looked
back
and
whined
as
if
to
say
they
ought
to
go
back
and
do
things
over
again
at
last
when
they
reached
the
country
roadside
where
all
was
still
and
there
were
only
the
brooding
stars
to
see
dan
sat
down
on
a
bank
by
the
roadside
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
both
down
upon
the
cool
wet
earth
that
was
just
beginning
to
spring
into
greenness
then
he
gave
way
to
his
grief
while
rags
almost
beside
himself
with
distress
whined
about
him
snuffed
up
and
down
the
road
and
then
sat
down
and
howled
at
the
late
moon
which
was
just
rising
over
a
hill
by
and
by
dan
got
up
and
called
the
dog
together
they
started
on
their
journey
again
a
silent
thoughtful
pair
but
never
afterward
did
the
boy
dan
return
he
was
a
man
he
had
suffered
and
grown
in
his
face
were
born
resolve
and
determination
people
wondered
at
the
change
in
the
careless
happy
boy
and
grew
proud
of
his
thoughtfulness
chapter
xxiii
the
night
that
dawn
left
her
husband
s
home
marked
the
beginning
of
an
era
of
sorrow
in
the
history
of
the
winthrops
the
distracted
young
husband
and
his
father
rode
all
night
long
charles
reached
the
van
rensselaers
home
a
little
sooner
than
old
winthrop
who
had
further
to
go
the
young
man
s
white
drawn
face
startled
van
rensselaer
as
he
stood
to
greet
her
in
the
gloomy
parlor
where
the
scent
of
the
wedding
roses
still
lingered
she
was
in
workaday
attire
to
set
her
house
in
order
and
prepare
for
what
she
hoped
was
to
be
a
season
of
peace
in
her
hitherto
tempestuous
life
dawn
was
off
her
hands
finally
she
felt
and
she
had
no
serious
forebodings
concerning
her
share
in
the
matter
the
hard
part
had
been
to
get
the
girl
off
without
her
finding
out
the
trick
that
had
been
played
on
her
it
had
amazed
the
that
her
plan
had
worked
so
well
she
had
been
prepared
for
the
discovery
to
be
made
soon
after
the
ceremony
but
she
had
trusted
to
dawn
s
fear
of
publicity
and
charles
s
evident
infatuation
to
hush
the
matter
up
van
rensselaer
had
been
reasonably
sure
that
she
could
even
keep
it
from
her
husband
s
knowledge
though
she
was
prepared
with
a
plausible
story
in
case
he
remonstrated
his
sense
of
pride
would
make
him
readily
persuadable
to
almost
any
plan
that
would
hide
their
mortification
from
curious
friends
she
had
been
sure
that
she
could
make
him
see
that
the
whole
thing
had
been
done
for
his
daughter
s
good
and
now
that
the
had
succeeded
even
better
than
she
had
hoped
in
getting
the
couple
off
on
their
wedding
trip
without
either
one
discovering
her
duplicity
she
had
been
at
rest
about
the
matter
charles
was
enough
in
love
to
be
able
to
make
everything
all
right
and
he
would
never
blame
her
for
having
furthered
his
plans
even
though
not
quite
in
the
way
he
had
arranged
dawn
could
not
fail
to
be
pleased
with
the
husband
her
had
secured
for
her
and
even
would
thank
her
in
later
life
perhaps
for
having
helped
her
to
him
and
so
van
rensselaer
had
gone
placidly
about
the
house
putting
things
to
rights
and
enjoying
the
prospect
of
a
comfortable
future
without
the
fear
of
an
unloved
s
presence
haunting
her
but
when
she
saw
charles
s
face
a
pang
of
fear
shot
through
her
and
left
her
trembling
with
apprehension
his
voice
sounded
hollow
and
accusatory
when
he
spoke
is
dawn
here
van
rensselaer
a
thousand
possibilities
rushed
through
the
woman
s
brain
at
once
and
she
felt
herself
brought
suddenly
before
an
awful
judgment
bar
what
had
she
done
how
had
she
dared
how
swift
was
retribution
not
even
one
whole
day
of
satisfaction
after
all
her
trouble
she
tried
to
summon
a
natural
voice
but
it
would
not
come
her
throat
felt
dry
and
as
if
it
did
not
belong
to
her
as
she
answered
here
no
how
could
she
be
here
didn
t
you
take
her
away
the
young
man
sat
down
suddenly
in
the
nearest
chair
with
a
groan
and
dropped
his
head
into
his
hands
the
woman
stood
silent
frightened
before
him
van
rensselaer
what
have
you
done
why
did
you
do
it
well
really
what
have
i
done
the
sharp
voice
of
the
woman
returned
to
combat
as
soon
as
the
accusation
pricked
her
into
anger
i
m
sure
i
helped
you
to
get
a
wife
you
seemed
to
want
bad
enough
and
never
would
have
got
if
i
hadn
t
managed
affairs
you
haven
t
any
idea
how
hard
she
was
to
manage
or
you
d
understand
it
was
a
very
trying
situation
and
it
isn
t
every
woman
could
have
made
things
go
as
well
as
i
to
have
a
soul
outside
your
family
know
there
had
been
a
change
of
bridegrooms
you
see
none
of
our
friends
had
ever
seen
your
brother
and
as
the
name
was
the
same
there
were
no
explanations
necessary
van
rensselaer
i
would
never
have
married
dawn
against
her
will
it
was
not
right
for
you
to
deceive
her
she
ought
to
have
been
told
just
how
things
stood
and
what
my
brother
had
done
h
m
and
had
a
pretty
mess
with
her
crying
and
saying
she
wouldn
t
marry
anybody
and
all
the
wedding
guests
coming
young
man
you
don
t
know
what
you
re
talking
about
that
girl
isn
t
easy
to
manage
and
i
guess
you
ve
found
it
out
already
she
s
like
a
flea
when
you
think
you
have
her
she
s
somewhere
else
i
knew
something
desperate
would
have
to
be
done
before
she
ever
settled
down
and
accepted
life
as
it
had
to
be
and
i
did
it
that
s
all
well
what
s
the
matter
any
way
have
you
got
tired
of
your
bargain
already
and
turned
her
out
of
your
house
van
rensselaer
was
exasperated
and
frightened
she
scarcely
knew
what
she
was
saying
any
moment
her
husband
might
come
into
the
house
if
she
could
only
get
the
interview
over
before
he
came
and
perhaps
hide
at
least
a
part
of
the
story
from
him
she
dreaded
his
terrible
temper
she
had
always
had
an
innate
presentiment
that
some
time
that
temper
would
be
let
loose
against
her
and
she
knew
now
the
moment
was
come
charles
looked
up
with
his
handsome
and
usually
kindly
eyes
blazing
with
amazement
and
indignation
van
rensselaer
my
wife
has
gone
away
we
have
searched
all
night
and
can
not
find
her
i
was
sure
she
had
come
home
oh
what
shall
i
do
well
i
m
sure
i
don
t
see
how
i
m
to
blame
for
her
having
left
you
snapped
out
van
rensselaer
i
did
my
part
and
made
sure
you
got
her
you
ought
to
have
been
able
to
keep
her
after
you
had
her
how
d
she
come
to
leave
you
i
can
not
tell
exactly
she
went
up
to
see
mother
a
few
minutes
after
supper
and
oh
said
van
rensselaer
with
disagreeable
significance
and
then
we
could
not
find
her
went
on
charles
unheeding
she
left
a
note
with
that
was
all
i
have
no
clue
the
front
door
opened
and
van
rensselaer
walked
in
his
face
was
white
for
he
had
not
slept
well
in
a
dream
his
dead
wife
had
stood
before
him
and
seemed
to
be
taking
him
to
task
about
her
child
the
daughter
who
left
her
father
s
house
but
a
few
hours
before
he
had
gone
out
for
the
morning
mail
hoping
to
get
rid
of
the
phantoms
that
pursued
his
steps
but
his
head
was
throbbing
how
much
he
had
heard
of
what
they
had
been
saying
they
did
not
know
he
stood
before
them
white
and
glancing
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
two
in
the
dim
parlor
where
is
my
daughter
he
asked
she
is
gone
van
rensselaer
answered
charles
pitifully
i
have
searched
for
her
all
night
long
i
hoped
she
was
here
gone
repeated
the
father
in
a
strange
voice
then
he
wavered
for
an
instant
and
fell
at
their
feet
as
if
dead
the
accusations
of
his
own
heart
had
reached
their
mark
the
iron
will
yielded
at
last
to
the
finger
of
god
they
carried
him
to
his
bed
and
called
the
doctor
confusion
reigned
in
the
house
the
old
doctor
shook
his
head
and
called
it
apoplexy
van
rensselaer
was
still
living
and
might
linger
for
some
time
but
it
would
be
a
living
death
and
so
while
he
lay
upon
his
bed
breathing
but
dead
to
the
world
about
him
they
made
what
plans
they
could
to
find
his
daughter
charles
s
father
came
in
sadly
reporting
no
success
in
the
search
they
started
out
once
more
after
a
brief
rest
van
rensselaer
was
in
no
condition
to
help
them
now
she
had
her
hands
full
poor
woman
one
thing
had
been
spared
her
her
husband
did
not
know
her
part
in
the
disappearance
of
his
daughter
perhaps
he
might
never
need
to
know
yet
as
she
went
about
ministering
to
that
silent
living
dead
whom
she
had
loved
beyond
anything
earthly
her
heart
was
full
of
bitterness
and
fear
the
months
that
followed
were
terrible
to
charles
after
a
few
days
of
keeping
the
matter
quiet
and
hoping
they
would
find
her
by
themselves
they
made
the
disappearance
public
and
the
whole
countryside
joined
in
the
search
the
greatest
drawback
to
success
was
that
so
few
people
had
seen
dawn
since
she
grew
up
the
servants
in
her
father
s
house
had
seen
her
during
the
week
she
had
been
home
from
school
but
scarcely
any
one
else
except
for
a
passing
glance
on
the
street
all
searching
was
in
vain
there
were
notices
put
in
the
papers
of
that
region
they
sent
to
her
old
school
for
knowledge
of
her
they
left
no
stone
unturned
and
the
wonder
of
it
is
that
dawn
s
friend
the
minister
or
some
of
the
selectmen
especially
silas
dobson
did
not
see
the
notices
that
appeared
in
new
york
papers
and
in
those
of
smaller
towns
and
connect
the
mysterious
disappearance
with
the
new
teacher
that
had
come
to
their
village
but
the
old
clergyman
had
vouched
for
her
and
there
was
apparently
no
mystery
about
her
this
good
man
did
not
often
have
opportunity
to
read
papers
of
other
towns
save
his
regular
weekly
religious
sheet
then
too
the
place
where
dawn
had
found
refuge
was
small
and
insignificant
and
not
on
the
line
of
most
travel
she
could
not
have
been
better
sheltered
from
the
searchers
it
was
the
day
after
charles
had
been
to
see
the
body
of
a
young
woman
who
had
been
found
in
the
river
some
fifty
miles
distant
from
his
home
that
he
became
ill
with
typhoid
fever
not
for
a
day
had
he
rested
or
given
up
his
search
when
one
clue
failed
he
went
to
the
next
with
restless
feverish
energy
and
a
haunted
look
in
his
eyes
the
boy
had
become
a
man
and
the
man
was
bearing
a
heavy
burden
his
father
saw
it
and
grieved
for
him
his
mother
saw
it
and
accused
herself
his
sisters
saw
it
and
did
their
best
to
help
him
betty
was
constantly
thinking
up
new
plans
for
the
search
and
saying
comforting
cheering
things
to
her
brother
charles
loved
her
dearly
for
it
but
nothing
brought
relief
his
affection
for
dawn
had
been
such
as
rarely
grows
in
a
human
heart
even
after
years
of
acquaintance
it
had
sprung
into
being
and
filled
his
whole
soul
it
is
said
that
to
the
average
man
love
is
but
an
incident
while
to
a
woman
it
is
the
whole
of
life
if
that
be
so
there
are
exceptions
and
charles
was
one
of
them
he
kept
his
love
for
his
as
the
greatest
thing
life
had
for
him
and
thought
of
nothing
else
day
or
night
but
to
find
her
no
one
dared
to
suggest
his
going
back
to
college
that
would
be
to
admit
that
the
search
was
hopeless
and
that
might
prove
fatal
to
charles
the
neighbors
had
begun
to
shake
their
heads
and
pity
him
it
was
even
whispered
that
the
girl
might
have
run
away
with
another
man
though
no
one
ventured
to
say
such
a
thing
in
the
hearing
of
the
family
if
it
had
been
in
these
days
of
telegraphs
and
telephones
railroads
and
detectives
it
would
have
been
but
a
matter
of
days
until
they
had
found
her
but
in
those
times
travel
and
search
were
long
and
hard
there
seemed
little
hope
it
was
the
third
dead
face
which
charles
had
searched
for
likeness
to
the
girl
he
loved
he
came
home
worn
and
exhausted
his
spirit
utterly
discouraged
and
weary
and
he
was
an
easy
prey
to
the
disease
which
gripped
him
from
the
first
in
its
most
violent
form
silence
and
sadness
settled
down
upon
the
winthrop
household
while
the
life
of
charles
was
held
in
the
balance
the
father
carried
on
the
search
for
the
lost
wife
more
vigorously
than
ever
believing
that
the
sight
of
her
might
bring
his
boy
back
even
from
the
grave
but
nothing
developed
news
from
the
van
rensselaers
gave
no
hope
of
the
paralyzed
man
s
recovery
he
was
lying
like
a
thing
of
stone
unable
to
move
he
could
not
even
make
a
sound
only
his
eyes
followed
his
tormented
wife
like
haunting
spirits
sent
to
condemn
her
the
face
was
set
in
its
stern
expression
like
a
fallen
statue
of
his
proud
imperious
self
it
was
before
charles
began
slowly
to
creep
back
to
life
and
there
was
still
no
clue
to
dawn
they
dreaded
to
have
him
ask
about
her
though
they
had
noticed
how
he
had
searched
their
faces
every
morning
after
consciousness
returned
to
him
he
knew
as
well
as
they
that
nothing
had
been
accomplished
toward
finding
her
one
day
he
seemed
more
cheerful
and
a
little
stronger
and
called
old
winthrop
to
his
side
father
said
he
i
ve
been
thinking
that
perhaps
she
d
not
like
to
come
back
here
the
way
she
feels
about
it
there
was
a
little
white
house
on
the
hills
beyond
albany
that
we
noticed
as
we
came
along
on
the
train
we
both
said
we
should
like
to
live
there
among
the
trees
would
you
be
willing
that
i
should
take
the
money
grandfather
left
to
me
and
buy
that
little
house
for
her
to
come
to
then
i
could
put
a
notice
in
the
papers
telling
her
it
was
ready
and
perhaps
she
would
see
it
and
understand
the
old
man
s
heart
was
heavy
for
he
had
begun
to
believe
that
dawn
was
no
longer
in
the
land
of
the
living
but
he
would
have
consented
to
any
plan
that
would
comfort
his
boy
and
give
him
a
new
interest
in
life
and
so
as
soon
as
charles
was
able
to
travel
they
went
together
to
purchase
the
small
farm
and
little
white
house
the
next
day
there
appeared
in
the
new
york
papers
this
notice
which
was
printed
many
weeks
and
copied
into
numerous
village
papers
dawn
the
little
white
house
we
saw
near
albany
is
ready
for
us
write
and
tell
me
where
to
find
you
charles
but
nothing
ever
came
in
answer
though
charles
watched
every
mail
with
feverish
anxiety
and
he
still
kept
up
his
search
in
other
directions
so
the
spring
crept
on
and
almost
it
was
a
year
since
dawn
had
left
him
chapter
xxiv
dawn
had
been
in
new
york
two
months
after
various
trying
experiences
in
getting
there
and
all
that
time
she
had
been
unable
to
find
anything
to
do
by
which
she
could
earn
her
living
the
miserable
little
boarding
place
the
best
she
could
afford
was
growing
more
and
more
uncomfortable
as
the
hot
weather
came
on
dawn
was
thin
and
worn
and
sad
her
money
which
she
had
earned
during
the
winter
and
which
she
had
always
carried
sewed
inside
her
garments
was
fast
melting
away
a
few
more
weeks
and
she
would
be
penniless
she
began
to
wonder
what
would
come
next
and
to
question
whether
it
would
not
have
been
better
to
stay
with
the
school
and
trust
the
old
minister
and
daniel
to
protect
her
from
harrington
winthrop
but
always
after
thinking
it
over
she
decided
that
she
could
not
have
been
safe
when
he
knew
her
whereabouts
there
was
one
other
thing
which
troubled
her
constantly
now
it
was
that
sentence
of
daniel
s
he
d
rather
have
you
the
trouble
than
to
have
no
trouble
without
you
was
it
true
did
charles
love
her
that
way
was
she
giving
him
trouble
by
staying
away
if
he
s
anything
like
you
say
he
is
he
s
most
crazy
hunting
you
daniel
had
said
was
true
too
could
he
be
hunting
her
yet
had
she
been
wrong
in
coming
away
gradually
she
came
to
admit
to
herself
that
there
might
have
been
a
better
way
she
might
have
made
a
mistake
but
it
was
too
late
now
to
remedy
it
she
could
not
go
back
on
her
promise
that
she
would
trouble
him
no
more
she
could
not
bring
added
disgrace
to
him
now
that
she
had
stayed
away
all
these
months
and
everybody
must
know
it
oh
how
long
and
hard
life
was
and
then
she
once
more
went
wearily
at
her
task
of
hunting
a
position
slowly
stealthily
up
from
the
south
strangely
unexpectedly
down
from
the
canadian
border
there
crept
a
grim
spectre
of
death
heard
of
from
afar
with
indifference
at
first
it
gradually
grew
more
terrifying
as
it
drew
nearer
now
and
then
the
death
of
a
victim
caused
uneasiness
to
become
more
manifest
hotter
grew
the
sun
and
nearer
drew
the
spectre
the
daily
papers
contained
advice
for
protection
against
it
the
cities
cleaned
their
streets
and
warned
their
citizens
the
temperance
societies
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
hard
drinkers
were
in
more
danger
than
others
meat
and
milk
and
vegetables
were
carefully
inspected
water
was
boiled
cheerfulness
was
put
on
like
a
garment
and
assurance
was
flaunted
everywhere
people
were
told
to
keep
up
a
good
heart
and
keep
clean
and
there
was
little
danger
still
the
spectre
crept
nearer
laying
hands
upon
its
victims
and
daily
the
reports
grew
more
alarming
it
was
near
the
end
of
june
when
the
ministers
met
in
new
york
and
petitioned
the
president
to
appoint
a
general
day
of
fasting
and
prayer
to
avert
the
oncoming
pestilence
andrew
jackson
replied
that
it
was
in
their
line
not
his
to
decide
whether
this
matter
was
important
enough
to
bring
to
the
notice
of
the
almighty
and
he
left
it
in
their
hands
the
days
went
by
and
the
spectre
crept
on
the
governors
of
the
states
began
to
appoint
days
of
prayer
at
last
the
cholera
was
a
recognized
fact
it
had
come
to
do
its
worst
the
newspapers
abandoned
their
talk
of
its
impossibility
and
set
about
making
the
best
of
things
describing
the
precautions
to
be
taken
the
preliminary
symptoms
and
the
best
method
of
treatment
for
a
time
during
the
latter
part
of
june
and
the
early
part
of
july
it
was
hoped
that
by
vigilance
and
care
it
could
be
kept
out
of
new
york
city
the
worst
of
the
pestilence
was
in
the
southern
states
though
it
had
made
great
ravages
as
far
north
as
cincinnati
and
from
canada
it
was
spreading
south
into
new
york
state
here
and
there
a
little
town
would
have
a
single
case
which
would
send
terror
throughout
the
county
and
daily
the
number
grew
greater
charles
was
looking
worn
and
thin
he
had
bought
the
little
house
and
had
had
it
renovated
it
was
furnished
now
and
waiting
for
the
bride
who
did
not
come
his
heart
grew
sick
with
the
great
fear
that
was
growing
within
him
the
fear
that
he
should
never
find
her
on
this
earth
of
late
a
new
worry
had
come
to
him
a
letter
had
come
to
his
father
from
harrington
s
wife
saying
that
she
was
destitute
as
her
husband
had
deserted
her
again
he
had
stayed
with
her
but
a
week
after
he
brought
her
home
though
he
had
promised
many
things
in
spite
of
himself
charles
could
not
get
it
out
of
his
mind
that
harrington
had
spirited
dawn
away
somewhere
he
did
not
doubt
her
for
an
instant
he
would
not
let
himself
think
that
she
might
still
have
some
lurking
love
for
the
man
who
had
not
scrupled
to
do
her
a
wrong
he
laid
all
blame
if
blame
there
was
upon
his
brother
harrington
had
sometimes
appropriated
his
younger
brother
s
boyish
treasures
to
his
own
use
when
they
were
both
younger
and
charles
had
no
doubt
he
would
not
hesitate
to
do
thus
even
with
his
brother
s
wife
were
such
a
thing
possible
sometimes
the
remembrance
of
the
terror
in
dawn
s
eyes
when
she
asked
about
harrington
and
where
she
would
have
to
meet
him
made
charles
fairly
writhe
and
he
felt
that
he
must
fly
somewhere
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
if
need
be
and
find
her
he
lay
on
the
couch
in
the
library
one
warm
evening
in
early
july
betty
sat
beside
him
reading
the
new
york
paper
which
had
just
been
brought
by
the
evening
coach
she
was
trying
to
distract
his
mind
from
the
sorrow
over
which
he
seemed
to
brood
every
minute
when
he
was
not
in
actual
motion
trying
to
find
his
wife
this
evening
there
was
a
deeper
gloom
over
them
on
account
of
having
received
that
morning
news
of
the
death
of
van
rensselaer
charles
lay
still
with
his
face
shaded
from
the
candlelight
and
let
betty
read
he
was
paying
little
heed
but
it
made
betty
happier
to
think
that
she
was
helping
him
to
bear
his
pain
the
little
sister
s
sympathy
was
a
great
comfort
and
so
if
she
could
think
she
was
helping
him
he
was
glad
he
was
occupied
in
trying
to
think
out
a
plan
for
finding
harrington
just
to
make
sure
that
he
knew
nothing
about
dawn
here
s
something
about
the
new
railroad
charles
shall
i
read
that
or
would
you
rather
have
me
read
s
than
the
oh
read
the
by
all
means
said
charles
trying
to
rouse
himself
to
take
an
interest
for
betty
s
sake
his
head
was
aching
and
he
was
weary
in
both
body
and
soul
well
listen
to
this
charles
isn
t
this
wonderful
they
ve
completed
the
railroad
from
saratoga
to
ballston
they
can
go
eight
miles
in
minutes
think
of
that
beside
the
travelling
it
takes
only
an
hour
and
five
minutes
to
go
from
ballston
to
schenectady
and
you
can
go
from
albany
to
saratoga
in
three
hours
who
would
ever
have
believed
it
true
do
you
suppose
it
is
true
or
have
they
exaggerated
oh
i
guess
they
can
do
it
said
charles
with
a
sigh
the
new
railroad
made
him
think
of
his
wedding
journey
oh
to
take
it
over
again
and
never
let
his
bride
out
of
his
sight
betty
read
on
governor
howard
of
maryland
has
set
july
as
a
day
of
prayer
that
the
cholera
may
decline
governor
cass
but
a
low
moan
from
charles
made
her
fly
to
another
column
to
distract
his
mind
here
s
the
report
of
the
meeting
of
the
foreign
mission
board
in
new
york
would
you
like
to
hear
that
it
looks
interesting
the
evening
address
was
made
by
the
honorable
stephen
van
rensselaer
betty
stopped
in
dismay
but
charles
answered
the
wonder
in
her
tone
quietly
yes
betty
stephen
van
rensselaer
is
a
cousin
of
van
rensselaer
he
is
a
fine
speaker
read
about
it
but
charles
did
not
attend
though
betty
rattled
off
a
lot
of
statistics
glibly
inwardly
blaming
herself
for
constantly
coming
upon
things
that
would
remind
charles
of
his
loss
there
are
twelve
missions
now
with
stations
under
the
board
seven
are
in
india
two
in
asia
four
in
the
mediterranean
seven
in
the
sandwich
islands
among
the
southwestern
indians
four
among
the
northeastern
indians
and
four
among
the
indians
of
new
york
state
there
are
missionaries
four
physicians
four
printers
eighteen
teachers
twenty
farmers
and
mechanics
and
one
hundred
and
females
married
and
single
sent
out
from
this
country
my
isn
t
that
a
lot
commented
betty
just
below
the
report
of
the
missionary
meeting
was
a
brief
paragraph
she
plunged
into
it
without
stopping
to
glance
it
over
a
female
dressed
in
a
white
straw
bonnet
trimmed
with
white
satin
ribbon
a
black
silk
gown
white
crêpe
shawl
with
flowered
border
black
silk
stockings
and
parasol
oh
cried
betty
in
dismay
and
then
went
wildly
on
to
the
next
column
not
daring
to
look
at
her
brother
the
honorable
william
wort
has
purchased
a
plantation
in
florida
and
is
going
to
work
it
with
hired
hands
this
will
do
more
toward
opening
the
eyes
of
the
slaveholders
than
all
the
declamatory
efforts
of
the
free
states
since
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
that
is
quoted
from
the
states
charles
and
the
editor
of
this
paper
has
a
long
comment
on
it
do
you
want
to
hear
it
betty
looked
uneasily
at
her
brother
but
his
white
face
was
turned
toward
the
wall
here
s
an
article
about
barnabas
bidwell
and
something
about
general
prosper
wetmore
doesn
t
father
know
general
wetmore
charles
betty
felt
she
was
not
getting
on
well
at
all
i
believe
he
does
answered
her
brother
patiently
and
then
the
knocker
sounded
insistently
through
the
house
and
charles
came
to
an
upright
position
in
an
instant
he
seemed
ever
to
be
thus
on
the
alert
for
something
to
happen
and
this
time
something
did
happen
a
negro
boy
stood
at
the
door
with
a
note
scrawled
on
a
leaf
from
a
he
said
he
was
to
give
it
to
winthrop
at
once
as
his
father
was
out
charles
read
it
betty
held
the
candle
for
him
to
see
it
was
badly
written
with
pale
ink
betty
s
hand
trembled
and
made
the
candle
waver
she
felt
that
something
momentous
was
in
the
air
come
to
me
at
once
i
m
desperately
read
the
note
it
was
like
the
writer
to
command
and
expect
to
be
obeyed
charles
pressed
the
note
into
betty
s
hand
saying
give
it
to
father
as
soon
as
he
comes
and
don
t
let
mother
or
aunt
martha
know
then
he
seized
his
hat
and
sprang
out
into
the
night
urging
his
escort
into
a
run
and
demanding
an
explanation
as
he
went
but
the
boy
could
tell
little
of
what
was
the
matter
he
knew
only
that
he
had
been
sent
in
great
haste
and
that
the
gentleman
was
very
sick
the
night
was
still
and
warm
there
was
a
yellow
haze
over
the
world
and
a
sultry
feeling
in
the
air
people
had
been
remarking
all
day
how
warm
it
was
for
the
season
of
year
charles
plunged
through
the
night
with
only
one
thought
in
mind
he
was
to
see
his
brother
in
a
few
minutes
and
he
must
take
every
means
to
find
out
whether
he
had
any
knowledge
of
dawn
his
whole
soul
was
bent
on
the
purpose
that
had
been
his
main
object
in
life
during
the
past
year
it
occurred
to
him
that
harrington
might
be
in
need
of
medical
attendance
though
that
was
a
sort
of
secondary
consideration
at
the
time
so
he
sent
the
negro
boy
after
their
family
physician
he
himself
went
on
alone
to
the
inn
some
two
miles
from
the
village
where
the
boy
said
his
brother
was
stopping
when
charles
reached
the
inn
he
found
a
group
of
excited
people
gathered
near
the
steps
and
the
word
cholera
floated
to
his
ears
but
it
meant
little
to
him
in
a
moment
he
was
standing
by
his
brother
s
bedside
harrington
turned
away
from
him
with
a
groan
is
it
only
you
he
muttered
angrily
i
sent
for
father
father
was
not
in
he
will
come
as
soon
as
he
returns
i
will
do
anything
you
want
done
i
have
sent
for
the
doctor
but
before
i
do
anything
you
must
answer
me
one
question
do
you
know
where
dawn
is
have
you
seen
her
since
the
day
of
the
wedding
harrington
turned
bloodshot
eyes
upon
his
brother
who
is
dawn
he
sneered
oh
i
see
you
mean
miss
van
rensselaer
yes
i
remember
you
were
smitten
with
her
the
only
time
you
ever
saw
her
i
believe
in
my
soul
it
was
you
who
cheated
me
out
of
my
little
game
and
not
alberta
at
all
well
it
doesn
t
matter
i
ve
got
something
better
on
the
string
now
if
i
ever
get
out
of
this
cursed
hole
let
the
baby
go
she
wasn
t
worth
all
the
trouble
it
took
to
keep
track
of
her
then
suddenly
he
was
seized
in
the
vise
of
an
awful
agony
and
cried
out
with
oaths
and
curses
down
below
his
window
a
group
of
huddled
negroes
heard
and
a
shudder
went
through
them
they
drew
away
and
whispered
in
sepulchral
tones
charles
stood
over
his
brother
in
helpless
horror
until
the
agony
was
passed
and
harrington
gasped
out
go
for
the
doctor
you
fool
do
you
want
to
see
me
die
before
your
eyes
charles
s
voice
was
grave
and
commanding
as
he
stood
over
his
brother
and
demanded
once
more
answer
me
harrington
have
you
seen
her
since
the
day
of
the
wedding
answer
me
quickly
i
will
help
you
just
as
soon
as
i
know
all
i
shall
not
do
a
thing
until
you
tell
me
a
groan
and
a
curse
were
all
the
answer
he
got
and
a
cold
frenzy
seized
him
lest
he
should
never
get
harrington
to
tell
what
he
knew
he
understood
that
his
brother
was
a
very
sick
man
great
beads
of
perspiration
stood
upon
his
forehead
get
me
some
whiskey
you
brute
cried
out
the
stricken
man
that
awful
agony
is
coming
again
well
if
you
must
know
she
s
teaching
school
in
a
little
forsaken
village
over
beyond
they
call
it
at
least
she
was
till
i
appeared
on
the
scene
then
she
made
away
with
herself
somehow
i
stayed
three
days
waiting
for
her
but
she
didn
t
come
back
i
stopped
off
last
week
and
the
people
said
she
d
never
returned
no
one
knew
anything
about
her
but
a
boy
who
called
himself
daniel
and
said
he
helped
carry
her
bag
to
the
now
get
me
that
whiskey
quick
i
feel
the
pain
coming
again
charles
turned
without
a
word
and
dashed
downstairs
to
the
landlady
demanding
hot
water
and
blankets
he
knew
little
about
illness
save
what
his
mother
s
state
had
taught
him
but
he
had
read
enough
in
the
papers
lately
to
make
him
sure
that
harrington
had
the
cholera
and
he
knew
that
whiskey
was
not
a
remedy
before
he
could
return
to
his
brother
the
doctor
arrived
and
together
they
went
up
to
the
sick
man
who
was
writhing
in
agony
and
again
demanding
whiskey
the
old
doctor
shook
his
head
when
he
saw
the
patient
he
has
indulged
in
that
article
far
too
much
already
he
said
then
began
a
night
of
horror
followed
by
a
day
of
stupor
on
the
part
of
the
patient
the
doctor
had
said
from
the
start
that
it
was
cholera
and
that
the
disease
was
almost
always
fatal
to
persons
of
intemperate
habits
charles
held
himself
steadily
to
the
task
of
the
moment
and
tried
to
still
the
calling
of
his
heart
to
fly
at
once
and
find
dawn
not
another
word
had
he
been
able
to
get
from
his
brother
the
pain
had
been
so
intolerable
that
harrington
had
been
unable
to
speak
and
little
by
little
he
grew
delirious
until
he
did
not
recognize
any
of
them
at
times
he
cried
out
as
if
in
wild
carouse
once
or
twice
he
called
alberta
in
an
angry
tone
then
muttered
van
rensselaer
s
name
never
once
did
he
speak
the
name
of
dawn
this
fact
gave
charles
unspeakable
relief
all
through
the
night
and
day
the
doctor
the
brother
and
the
father
worked
side
by
side
but
each
knew
from
the
first
that
there
was
no
hope
and
at
evening
he
died
they
buried
harrington
winthrop
in
the
old
lot
where
rested
the
mortal
remains
of
other
more
worthy
members
of
the
family
and
the
father
turned
away
with
bowed
head
and
broken
heart
for
such
an
ending
to
his
elder
son
s
misspent
life
and
kept
saying
over
to
himself
has
it
been
my
fault
has
it
been
my
fault
they
were
almost
home
when
charles
who
had
been
silent
and
thoughtful
touched
the
older
man
on
the
shoulder
father
shall
you
mind
my
going
away
at
once
he
asked
i
have
a
clue
and
must
follow
it
winthrop
lifted
his
head
and
looking
at
his
son
tenderly
said
go
my
boy
and
may
you
gain
your
heart
s
desire
chapter
xxv
the
next
evening
at
sunset
charles
stood
beside
the
butterworth
gate
about
to
enter
when
daniel
came
out
the
boy
had
finished
his
early
supper
and
was
going
to
the
village
on
an
errand
his
face
was
grave
and
thoughtful
as
always
since
the
teacher
s
departure
charles
watched
him
coming
down
to
the
gate
and
liked
his
broad
shoulders
and
the
blue
eyes
under
his
curly
yellow
lashes
as
he
looked
up
are
you
daniel
butterworth
asked
charles
i
am
said
dan
eying
him
keenly
are
you
the
one
was
going
to
say
boy
but
that
did
not
seem
to
apply
exactly
to
this
grave
young
are
you
the
one
who
carried
the
teacher
s
baggage
to
the
when
she
went
away
so
suddenly
charles
had
studied
the
question
carefully
he
did
not
know
by
what
name
dawn
had
gone
whether
she
had
used
his
or
kept
her
own
maiden
name
or
had
assumed
still
another
he
would
not
cast
a
shadow
of
reflection
upon
her
or
risk
his
chance
of
finding
her
by
using
the
wrong
name
therefore
he
called
her
the
teacher
on
inquiring
about
her
at
the
inn
where
the
stopped
he
had
been
referred
at
once
to
peggy
gillette
who
immediately
guided
him
to
the
point
in
the
road
where
he
could
see
the
butterworth
house
daniel
started
and
looked
the
stranger
over
suspiciously
there
was
a
something
about
this
long
strong
fellow
that
reminded
him
a
little
just
a
very
little
of
the
scoundrel
who
had
frightened
the
teacher
away
yet
he
instinctively
liked
this
man
and
felt
that
he
was
to
be
trusted
rags
too
generally
suspicious
of
strangers
had
been
smelling
and
snuffing
about
this
man
and
now
stood
wagging
his
tail
with
a
smile
on
his
homely
shaggy
face
rags
s
judgment
was
generally
to
be
trusted
i
might
be
responded
daniel
slowly
and
then
again
i
mightn
t
who
are
you
charles
understood
that
the
boy
was
testing
him
and
he
liked
him
the
better
for
it
his
heart
warmed
toward
the
one
who
had
protected
dawn
that
s
all
right
responded
charles
heartily
i
m
ready
to
identify
myself
i
m
one
who
loves
her
better
than
my
life
and
i
ve
done
nothing
for
a
year
but
search
for
her
he
let
daniel
see
the
depth
of
his
meaning
in
his
eyes
as
the
boy
looked
keenly
wistfully
into
his
face
daniel
was
satisfied
and
with
a
great
sigh
of
renunciation
he
said
i
knew
it
i
told
her
so
i
knew
you
would
be
half
crazy
hunting
her
you
re
the
one
she
said
she
belonged
to
aren
t
you
a
great
light
broke
over
charles
s
face
bringing
out
all
the
beauty
of
his
soul
all
the
lines
of
character
that
suffering
had
set
upon
his
youth
and
that
love
had
wrought
into
his
fibre
oh
daniel
bless
you
did
she
tell
you
that
yes
she
belongs
to
me
and
i
to
her
and
if
you
ll
only
tell
me
where
to
find
her
you
ll
make
me
the
happiest
man
on
earth
he
grasped
the
boy
s
hand
in
his
firm
smooth
one
and
they
stood
as
if
making
a
life
compact
each
glad
of
the
other
s
touch
daniel
i
feel
as
if
you
were
an
angel
of
light
broke
out
charles
the
angel
in
blue
homespun
lifted
his
eyes
to
the
stranger
s
face
and
was
glad
since
he
might
not
have
the
one
he
loved
that
she
belonged
to
this
other
he
had
done
the
best
he
could
do
for
her
and
his
was
the
part
of
sacrifice
i
can
t
tell
you
just
where
she
is
said
daniel
gravely
i
thought
mebbe
you
d
know
from
this
she
s
sent
me
two
books
since
she
went
away
and
they
re
both
new
that
s
all
i
know
he
pulled
out
a
tattered
paper
that
had
wrapped
a
parcel
and
together
they
studied
the
marks
charles
s
face
grew
grave
new
york
was
a
large
place
even
in
those
days
yet
it
was
more
definite
than
the
whole
united
states
which
had
been
his
field
of
action
thus
far
he
would
not
despair
he
would
take
heart
of
grace
and
go
forward
daniel
said
he
handing
back
the
paper
to
its
owner
with
a
delicate
feeling
that
the
boy
had
the
first
right
to
it
since
he
was
the
link
between
them
will
you
go
to
new
york
with
me
and
help
me
to
find
her
dan
s
face
lit
up
until
he
was
actually
handsome
me
rags
wagged
his
tail
hard
and
gave
a
sharp
little
bark
as
if
to
say
me
yes
both
of
you
said
charles
joyously
he
felt
as
if
he
were
on
the
right
track
at
last
and
his
soul
could
fairly
shout
for
happiness
rags
might
do
a
lot
toward
finding
her
he
d
track
her
anywhere
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
get
him
away
from
her
when
she
got
into
the
to
go
away
dan
looked
down
at
his
companion
lovingly
and
rags
lifted
one
ear
in
recognition
of
the
compliment
meanwhile
keeping
wistful
eyes
on
the
stranger
it
almost
looked
as
if
he
understood
charles
stooped
down
and
patted
him
warmly
and
the
ugly
little
dog
wriggled
all
over
with
great
happiness
of
course
he
must
go
with
us
then
said
charles
yes
and
the
way
he
lit
into
that
chap
that
came
and
frightened
her
away
was
something
fine
went
on
dan
tell
me
about
it
said
charles
dan
gave
a
brief
account
of
harrington
s
visit
to
the
village
and
dawn
s
departure
charles
s
face
was
grave
and
sad
as
they
spoke
of
his
brother
harrington
s
death
was
too
recent
and
too
terrible
to
admit
of
bitter
memories
he
kept
his
head
bent
down
toward
rags
who
was
luxuriating
in
the
stranger
s
fondling
while
daniel
was
talking
then
he
gave
the
dog
a
final
pat
and
stood
up
daniel
said
he
that
man
was
my
brother
and
he
died
of
cholera
three
days
ago
he
did
wrong
and
made
a
lot
of
trouble
and
he
almost
broke
my
father
s
heart
but
his
death
was
an
awful
one
and
perhaps
we
d
better
not
think
about
his
part
in
this
matter
any
more
he
s
gone
beyond
our
reach
i
didn
t
know
said
dan
awkwardly
i
m
sorry
i
said
it
s
all
right
said
charles
heartily
i
saw
how
you
felt
and
i
thought
i
d
better
tell
you
all
about
it
i
need
your
help
and
it
s
best
to
be
frank
and
now
how
about
it
will
you
go
with
me
to
help
find
her
will
your
family
object
i
ll
see
to
the
expense
of
course
and
will
make
it
as
pleasant
as
i
can
for
you
i
ll
go
said
dan
briefly
but
his
tone
meant
a
great
deal
if
he
had
lived
in
these
days
he
would
have
answered
sure
with
that
peculiar
inflection
that
implies
loyalty
charles
understood
the
embarrassed
heartiness
and
took
the
reply
as
it
was
intended
how
soon
can
we
start
he
asked
anxiously
every
moment
meant
something
to
him
and
he
was
impatient
to
be
off
he
took
out
his
watch
it
was
quarter
to
six
they
told
me
there
was
a
making
connection
with
the
early
boat

york

seven
o
clock

too
soon

said
daniel
in
a
voice
that
was
hoarse
with
excitement
i
just
got
to
change
my
clothes
will
you
come
in
suppose
i
wait
on
the
front
stoop
suggested
charles
seeing
the
embarrassment
in
the
boy
s
face
all
right
said
daniel
i
won
t
be
long
butterworth
looked
up
anxiously
as
dan
came
into
the
kitchen
she
had
been
watching
the
interview
from
the
side
window
i
m

the
front
stoop

where

my
clean
shirt
ma
it
s
gettin
late
daniel
had
thrown
off
his
coat
and
was
struggling
with
a
refractory
buckle
of
his
suspenders
as
he
talked
his
mother
was
roused
at
last
to
her
duties
and
brought
the
shirt
with
which
he
vanished
to
the
loft
then
the
mother
partly
to
reassure
herself
about
the
stranger
filled
a
plate
with
cold
ham
bread
and
butter
a
generous
slice
of
apple
pie
and
three
or
four
fat
doughnuts
and
cautiously
opened
the
front
door
rags
not
having
to
change
his
clothes
had
remained
with
charles
and
was
enjoying
a
friendly
hand
on
his
head
while
he
sat
alert
waiting
for
what
was
to
happen
next
when
dan
appeared
things
would
move
he
knew
and
he
meant
to
be
in
them
he
wasn
t
going
to
trust
any
verbal
promises
he
was
going
with
them
if
he
had
to
do
it
on
the
sly
charles
arose
and
received
the
bountiful
supper
graciously
when
butterworth
saw
the
manner
of
the
stranger
who
sat
on
her
front
settle
she
was
ashamed
to
be
handing
him
a
plate
outside
as
if
he
were
a
tramp
dan
l
said
you
wouldn
t
come
in
she
said
hospitably
and
i
couldn
t
bear
not
to
give
you
a
bite
to
eat
you
should
a
happened
long
sooner
while
supper
was
hot
we
all
thought
a
lot
o
miss
montgomery
was
you
her
brother
perhaps
while
she
had
prepared
the
lunch
she
had
questioned
within
herself
what
sort
of
friend
this
might
be
with
whom
dan
was
going
to
visit
the
teacher
if
dan
wanted
to
make
up
to
teacher
why
did
he
not
go
alone
charles
perceived
that
daniel
had
not
explained
to
his
mother
and
keeping
his
own
counsel
returned
pleasantly
oh
no
not
her
brother
and
he
began
to
tell
butterworth
how
glad
he
was
to
have
her
son
s
company
on
his
visit
to
new
york
his
manner
was
so
reassuring
that
she
decided
he
was
all
right
and
as
dan
came
down
his
face
shining
from
much
soap
and
his
hair
plastered
as
smoothly
as
his
rough
curls
would
allow
she
said
pleasantly
you
ll
see
my
boy
don
t
get
into
bad
company
down
in
new
york
won
t
you
i
m
worried
sort
of
fer
his
pa
said
last
night
there
was
cholera
round
charles
s
face
sobered
in
an
instant
we
ll
take
good
care
of
each
other
butterworth
don
t
you
worry
i
m
much
obliged
for
your
letting
me
have
daniel
for
company
and
i
ll
try
to
make
him
have
a
pleasant
time
the
village
people
stared
at
dan
as
he
got
into
the
stage
with
the
stranger
they
wondered
where
he
was
going
one
of
the
boys
made
bold
to
slide
up
to
the
coach
and
ask
him
but
he
got
little
satisfaction
just
running
down
to
new
york
for
a
few
days
dan
answered
nonchalantly
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
occurrence
amid
the
envious
stares
of
the
boys
the
coach
drove
away
into
the
evening
and
daniel
sat
silently
beside
his
companion
wondering
at
himself
his
heart
throbbing
greatly
that
he
might
within
a
few
hours
see
the
girl
who
had
made
such
a
difference
in
his
life
about
midnight
everybody
but
charles
and
daniel
got
out
of
the
coach
comfortably
ensconced
the
two
young
men
might
have
slept
but
charles
was
too
nervous
and
excited
to
sleep
and
daniel
was
not
far
behind
him
daniel
said
charles
suddenly
breaking
the
silence
that
had
fallen
upon
them
though
each
knew
the
other
was
not
sleeping
by
what
name
did
she
go
your
mother
spoke
of
her
as
miss
montgomery
was
that
the
name
she
gave
yes
said
daniel
wondering
mary
montgomery
it
was
her
mother
s
name
said
charles
reverently
dawn
had
talked
to
him
of
her
mother
on
their
wedding
trip
daniel
there
is
something
more
that
perhaps
i
ought
to
tell
you
did
she
tell
you
that
she
and
i
are
married
no
said
dan
his
voice
was
shaking
as
he
tried
to
take
in
the
thought
it
was
as
if
he
were
expecting
an
unbearable
pain
in
a
nerve
that
had
already
throbbed
its
life
out
and
was
at
rest
he
was
surprised
to
find
how
natural
it
seemed
then
he
stammered
out
i
guess
i
must
have
known
though
she
said
she
belonged
to
you
and
so
nobody
else
could
take
care
of
her
thank
you
for
telling
me
that
said
charles
he
laid
his
hand
warmly
on
dan
s
the
boy
liked
his
touch
rags
who
was
sleeping
at
their
feet
nestled
closer
to
them
both
with
a
sleepy
whine
he
was
content
now
that
he
was
really
on
his
way
i
guess
said
dan
i
guess
i
better
tell
you
the
whole
because
i
like
you
and
you
re
the
right
kind
you
seem
like
what
she
ought
to
have
and
i
m
glad
it
s
was
kind
of
hard
because
you
see
i
d
have
liked
to
take
care
of
her
myself
i
didn
t
know
about
you
till
she
told
me
and
though
i
knew
of
course
i
wasn
t
much
to
look
at
beside
her
i
could
have
done
a
lot
for
her
and
i
mean
to
go
to
college
yet
any
way
just
to
show
her
you
see
i
guess
it
ain
t
right
to
go
along
with
you
to
see
her
and
not
tell
you
what
i
said
to
her
i
told
her
i
loved
her
and
it
was
true
too
i
d
have
died
for
her
if
it
was
necessary
if
that
makes
any
difference
to
you
rags
and
i
ll
get
out
and
walk
back
now
i
thought
i
ought
to
tell
you
i
couldn
t
help
loving
her
could
i
when
she
did
so
much
for
me
and
you
see
i
never
knew
about
you
it
was
a
long
speech
for
the
silent
dan
to
make
but
charles
s
warm
through
it
all
helped
wonderfully
as
well
as
dan
s
growing
liking
for
dawn
s
husband
bless
you
daniel
said
charles
throwing
his
arm
about
his
companion
s
shoulders
as
he
used
to
do
with
his
chums
in
college
you
just
sit
right
still
where
you
are
it
was
noble
and
honest
of
you
to
tell
me
that
i
believe
in
my
heart
i
like
you
all
the
better
for
it
we
are
brothers
you
see
for
i
love
her
that
way
too
and
it
gives
me
a
lot
of
comfort
to
know
you
can
understand
me
but
old
don
t
quite
know
how
to
say
m
deeply
sorry
that
your
love
has
brought
you
only
pain
and
i
feel
all
the
more
warmly
toward
you
that
you
tried
to
help
her
when
you
knew
she
belonged
to
some
one
else
i
never
can
thank
you
enough
i
couldn
t
have
helped
it
said
dan
gruffly
if
anybody
her
they
d
to
take
care
of
her
it
killed
dan
old
fellow
i
love
said
charles
impulsively
you
can
t
know
what
this
is
to
me
that
you
took
care
of
her
when
i
couldn
t
i
ll
love
you
always
and
i
shall
never
forget
what
you
ve
done
for
me
now
begin
at
the
beginning
and
tell
me
all
you
know
about
her
won
t
you
i
m
hungry
to
hear
and
dan
found
himself
telling
the
whole
story
of
how
dawn
had
conquered
him
the
ringleader
of
mischief
in
the
school
made
him
her
slave
and
helped
him
up
to
a
plane
where
higher
ambitions
and
nobler
standards
had
changed
his
whole
idea
of
life
as
he
listened
to
the
homely
boyish
phrases
and
read
between
the
lines
the
pathos
of
dawn
s
struggles
charles
found
tears
standing
in
his
eyes
to
think
his
little
had
been
through
so
much
all
by
herself
without
him
near
to
help
and
comfort
would
he
ever
ever
be
able
to
make
up
to
her
for
it
he
expressed
this
thought
clumsily
to
dan
and
the
boy
all
eager
now
with
sympathy
and
loving
charles
as
loyally
as
dawn
said
royally
i
calculate
one
sight
of
your
face
ll
make
her
forget
it
all
leastways
that
s
the
way
it
looks
to
me
they
talked
at
intervals
all
night
charles
drew
from
daniel
his
ambition
to
get
an
education
and
be
worthy
to
be
the
friend
of
such
a
teacher
as
he
had
had
the
boy
said
it
shyly
and
then
added
and
you
too
if
you
ll
let
me
and
there
in
the
early
breaking
of
the
morning
light
the
two
young
men
made
a
solemn
compact
of
friendship
through
life
when
the
sun
shone
forth
and
touched
the
hills
glinting
the
hudson
in
the
distance
daniel
sat
up
and
looked
about
him
with
a
new
interest
in
life
and
a
happier
feeling
in
his
heart
than
he
had
had
since
dawn
went
away
three
days
they
spent
in
new
york
searching
for
dawn
the
paper
that
had
wrapped
dan
s
book
they
took
to
the
first
and
by
careful
inquiry
were
able
to
discover
in
what
quarter
of
the
city
the
package
was
mailed
though
of
course
this
was
very
slight
information
as
she
might
have
been
far
from
her
living
place
when
she
mailed
it
they
also
discovered
the
store
where
the
books
were
bought
for
charles
had
had
the
forethought
to
send
daniel
back
for
them
before
they
started
the
clerk
who
had
sold
them
to
her
remembered
her
and
described
her
as
beautiful
with
black
curls
inside
a
white
bonnet
and
a
dark
silk
frock
he
said
she
had
sad
eyes
and
looked
thin
and
pale
this
troubled
charles
more
than
he
was
willing
to
admit
to
dan
having
narrowed
their
clue
to
this
most
indefinite
point
they
held
a
consultation
and
decided
that
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
walk
around
that
quarter
of
the
city
and
see
if
they
could
get
sight
of
her
or
possibly
rags
would
get
on
a
scent
of
her
footsteps
in
some
spot
less
travelled
than
others
it
was
almost
a
hopeless
search
yet
they
started
bravely
on
the
hunt
and
talked
to
rags
in
a
way
that
would
have
made
an
ordinary
dog
beside
himself
charles
had
with
him
the
gloves
that
dawn
had
dropped
on
the
floor
beside
the
bed
when
she
fled
from
his
home
he
always
carried
them
with
him
in
his
he
took
them
out
and
let
rags
smell
of
them
then
dan
said
rags
go
find
teacher
teacher
rags
go
find
teacher
rags
sniffed
and
looked
wistfully
in
their
faces
then
barked
and
started
on
a
sniffing
tour
all
about
them
his
homely
face
wearing
a
look
of
dog
anxiety
he
thought
he
comprehended
what
they
wanted
but
was
not
sure
he
had
felt
a
great
loss
since
the
teacher
went
away
was
it
possible
they
expected
him
to
find
her
during
the
three
days
they
haunted
the
streets
of
the
city
both
day
and
evening
and
rags
was
quite
worn
out
with
sniffing
once
or
twice
he
thought
he
had
found
a
trail
but
it
came
to
nothing
and
he
scurried
dejectedly
on
ahead
hoping
his
followers
had
not
noticed
him
bark
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
they
turned
into
a
narrow
street
which
was
almost
like
a
lane
compared
to
other
streets
there
were
only
tiny
gloomy
houses
and
noisy
people
stood
in
the
doorways
or
conversed
across
the
street
it
seemed
a
most
unlikely
neighborhood
for
their
search
and
charles
was
half
of
a
mind
to
turn
back
and
take
another
street
but
almost
at
the
entrance
to
the
street
rags
had
gone
quite
wild
and
nosed
his
way
rapidly
down
the
uneven
pavement
until
he
stopped
beside
a
humble
doorstep
and
went
nosing
about
and
yelping
in
great
delight
the
door
was
closed
but
he
tried
the
steps
and
even
sniffed
under
the
crack
and
then
came
bounding
back
to
his
companions
what
have
you
found
rags
boy
said
charles
he
did
not
believe
they
would
find
any
trace
of
dawn
here
he
thinks
he
s
found
her
said
dan
convincingly
he
never
acts
like
that
without
a
reason
rags
find
teacher
where
is
she
rags
answered
rags
sharply
as
much
as
to
say
why
don
t
you
open
the
door
and
find
her
yourself
an
old
woman
came
to
the
door
and
looked
sharply
at
the
dog
on
her
clean
step
charles
took
off
his
hat
we
are
looking
for
a
friend
madam
who
is
stopping
in
this
neighborhood
somewhere
and
we
do
not
know
her
address
our
dog
thinks
he
has
found
a
trace
of
her
but
he
is
probably
mistaken
you
don
t
happen
to
have
noticed
anywhere
near
here
a
young
woman
with
dark
eyes
and
dark
curling
hair
lately
come
to
the
more
than
two
months
ago
perhaps
you
wouldn
t
be
meanin
pretty
mary
her
heart
ye
the
old
woman
asked
quizzically
surveying
the
two
but
rags
had
stayed
not
on
the
order
of
his
going
he
had
dashed
past
the
old
woman
and
up
the
stairs
to
the
floor
above
och
look
at
the
little
varmint
said
the
old
woman
forgetting
her
question
and
dashing
after
the
dog
thus
missing
the
startled
look
that
came
into
the
faces
of
both
young
men
but
after
a
series
of
short
sharp
barks
rags
returned
as
quickly
as
he
had
gone
almost
knocking
the
old
lady
down
her
rickety
stairs
in
his
delight
and
bearing
in
his
mouth
a
fragment
of
gray
cloth
which
he
brought
and
laid
triumphantly
at
his
master
s
feet
dan
stooped
and
picked
it
up
almost
reverently
and
smoothed
the
frayed
edges
it
was
a
bit
of
dawn
s
gray
that
she
had
torn
off
where
the
facing
was
worn
and
had
caught
her
foot
as
she
walked
dan
recognized
the
cloth
at
once
charles
had
never
seen
the
gown
but
he
saw
that
the
bit
of
cloth
had
some
significance
to
dan
he
rushed
in
after
the
old
lady
who
had
now
descended
the
stairs
wrathfully
behind
the
dog
tell
me
where
this
miss
montgomery
is
please
he
said
as
quietly
as
he
could
he
had
followed
so
many
clues
and
seen
them
turn
into
nothing
before
his
eyes
he
scarcely
could
dare
hope
now
his
heart
was
beating
wildly
was
he
to
see
dawn
again
at
last

daniel
held
up
the
fragment
of
cloth
it
s
the
frock
she
wore
to
school
he
said
he
spoke
hoarsely
and
handled
it
as
though
it
belonged
to
the
dead
it
seemed
terrible
to
him
to
have
found
where
she
had
been
and
not
find
her
they
followed
the
old
woman
upstairs
scarcely
hearing
her
dissertation
nor
realizing
that
she
took
them
for
possible
roomers
the
room
was
neat
as
the
woman
had
said
but
bare
and
gloomy
nothing
but
blank
walls
and
chimneys
to
be
seen
from
the
tiny
window
where
the
sun
streamed
in
unhindered
across
the
meagre
bed
and
deal
chair
and
table
which
were
the
only
furnishings
charles
s
heart
grew
tender
with
pity
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
he
looked
upon
it
all
and
realized
that
his
wife
had
slept
there
on
that
hard
bed
and
had
for
a
time
called
that
dreary
spot
home
he
glanced
involuntarily
out
of
the
window
noting
the
garbage
in
the
back
yards
below
and
the
unpleasant
odors
that
arose
and
remembered
the
warnings
and
precautions
with
which
the
papers
had
been
filled
even
before
the
cholera
had
come
so
close
to
them
he
shuddered
to
think
what
might
have
happened
to
dawn
but
where
has
she
gone
he
asked
the
old
woman
yes
that
s
what
we
want
to
know
said
dan
yes
where
barked
rags
behind
the
old
woman
s
heels
which
made
her
jump
and
exclaim
och
the
varmint
until
dan
called
the
dog
to
his
side
she
s
gone

like

the
good
woman
though
they
tried
both
with
money
and
questions
dawn
had
been
there
for
two
months
and
had
gone
out
every
day
hunting
work
she
had
come
back
every
night
weary
and
discouraged
but
always
with
a
smile
at
last
she
had
come
home
with
a
newspaper
her
face
whiter
than
usual
and
as
the
old
widow
had
put
it
said
mrs
o
donnell
i
m
away
in
the
marn
fer
i
m
thinkin

and
away
she
goes
the
two
young
men
turned
away
at
last
after
having
made
rags
smell
all
around
the
room
he
insisted
upon
their
taking
a
folded
bit
of
paper
that
he
found
on
the
floor
by
the
window
as
if
it
were
something
precious
belonging
to
her
they
bade
o
donnell
after
charles
had
given
her
something
to
solace
her
for
losing
two
prospective
roomers
and
went
out
to
search
again
rags
preceded
them
down
the
street
following
the
scent
rapidly
until
he
reached
the
corner
where
he
seemed
in
some
perplexity
for
a
time
finally
he
chose
the
street
leading
to
the
river
and
going
more
slowly
and
crookedly
sometimes
zigzagging
and
sometimes
going
back
to
make
sure
he
brought
them
at
last
to
the
perhaps
they
thought
she
might
have
followed
the
advice
of
the
old
woman
and
gone
back
to
her
own
home
knew
with
heavy
hearts
they
set
about
finding
what
boats
had
left
the
wharf
the
day
before
about
the
hour
the
old
woman
had
said
that
the
girl
had
left
her
house
but
the
morning
boat
of
the
day
before
had
just
come
in
and
was
lying
by
for
repairs
after
some
questioning
the
captain
professed
to
recall
such
a
passenger
as
they
described
but
as
all
the
decks
had
been
scrubbed
rags
with
his
eager
nose
was
unable
to
corroborate
the
captain
s
testimony
charles
and
dan
lost
no
time
in
securing
passage
on
the
boat
which
was
to
sail
that
evening
for
albany
where
the
captain
said
he
was
sure
the
young
lady
had
gotten
off
the
evening
before
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
they
spent
in
making
inquiries
in
every
direction
leaving
written
messages
directed
to
miss
mary
montgomery
and
putting
notices
in
the
various
city
papers
rags
meantime
was
much
annoyed
and
disturbed
by
their
digression
he
felt
that
the
boat
was
the
place
to
stay
he
was
satisfied
they
were
on
the
right
track
if
he
had
been
managing
the
expedition
he
would
have
had
the
boat
start
at
once
when
it
finally
did
leave
the
wharf
he
sat
up
on
deck
with
his
on
the
railing
and
barked
his
satisfaction
then
settled
down
to
rest
at
the
feet
of
the
two
beloved
ones
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
on
his
grizzly
face
chapter
xxvi
the
day
before
dawn
left
new
york
the
city
papers
officially
announced
that
the
cholera
had
reached
the
city
their
columns
were
filled
with
admonitions
and
the
symptoms
of
the
disease
from
start
to
finish
were
plainly
told
everybody
was
ordered
to
clean
up
and
keep
clean
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
but
cholera
news
in
the
paper
a
full
report
was
given
of
every
case
and
two
long
columns
reported
the
progress
of
the
disease
in
other
states
and
cities
as
dawn
passed
wearily
away
from
an
office
where
she
had
spent
the
entire
day
waiting
for
a
man
who
she
hoped
might
use
his
influence
to
get
her
a
chance
to
teach
a
small
school
in
a
country
district
but
who
did
not
come
she
caught
the
cry
of
the
newsboys
york
all
bout
the
cholera
it
was
not
often
she
spent
her
hoarded
pennies
for
a
paper
but
a
sudden
desire
to
know
the
truth
about
the
fearful
epidemic
seized
her
she
bought
a
paper
and
turned
to
the
general
report
column
almost
at
once
her
eye
caught
the
name
of
a
town
not
far
from
where
her
father
lived
with
a
report
of
three
cases
of
cholera
she
read
on
down
the
column
and
suddenly
her
heart
stood
still
with
horror
sloansville
she
read
a
man
who
gave
his
name
as
harrington
winthrop
died
here
last
week
of
cholera
he
was
in
an
advanced
stage
of
the
disease
when
he
arrived
in
a
hired
carriage
and
died
a
few
hours
later
his
father
and
brother
were
sent
for
and
arrived
before
his
death
this
case
has
caused
a
panic
among
the
negroes
in
the
vicinity
and
there
have
been
a
few
suspicious
cases
of
illness
which
are
being
carefully
watched
everything
is
being
done
to
prevent
a
further
spread
of
the
disease
dawn
felt
a
sudden
weakness
and
hurried
back
to
her
wretched
boarding
place
to
lie
down
she
did
not
feel
like
eating
any
supper
though
the
old
woman
prepared
some
tea
and
toast
and
brought
it
up
to
her
dawn
lay
panting
on
her
hard
little
bed
and
the
hot
breath
of
the
night
came
in
at
her
window
redolent
of
all
the
departed
dinners
of
the
neighborhood
a
stench
of
garbage
sometimes
varied
the
atmosphere
as
the
faint
breeze
died
away
and
the
noises
of
a
careless
community
jangled
all
about
her
she
thought
of
the
rules
of
cleanliness
that
had
been
laid
down
in
the
papers
and
of
the
probability
that
they
would
not
be
carried
out
in
this
street
she
pictured
herself
sick
with
cholera
with
no
one
but
the
poor
old
woman
to
wait
upon
her
and
no
doctor
the
smells
the
awful
smells
would
be
going
on
and
on
and
she
would
be
unable
to
get
up
and
get
away
from
them
she
thought
of
the
hot
hot
sun
that
would
stream
in
at
her
curtainless
window
when
the
day
broke
again
and
wondered
why
she
had
come
to
this
terrible
city
where
there
was
no
work
and
no
place
in
the
world
for
a
lonely
pilgrim
whom
nobody
wanted
then
over
her
rolled
a
deep
relief
at
the
thought
that
harrington
winthrop
would
trouble
her
no
more
though
it
seemed
awful
to
rejoice
in
what
must
have
been
a
terrible
death
yet
it
could
not
but
make
life
freer
for
her
for
she
would
have
one
thing
less
to
fear
gradually
as
she
thought
about
it
another
fear
seized
her
charles
his
brother
her
husband
had
been
with
him
when
he
died
perhaps
he
too
would
take
it
and
die
and
she
would
never
know
never
see
him
again
in
this
life
she
would
be
left
in
this
awful
world
where
she
had
no
friends
and
none
to
love
her
save
a
poor
boy
to
whose
kind
heart
she
had
brought
only
pain
why
not
go
back
to
the
neighborhood
where
charles
was
she
need
not
let
herself
be
known
she
could
surely
find
some
secluded
place
where
she
could
earn
enough
to
keep
her
yet
where
she
might
find
out
how
he
was
and
maybe
catch
a
glimpse
of
him
now
and
then
it
was
strange
this
idea
had
not
entered
her
mind
before
it
had
never
seemed
to
her
possible
that
she
could
go
back
but
now
the
spectre
of
death
had
made
her
see
things
in
a
different
light
she
wanted
to
get
back
to
the
greenness
and
the
coolness
of
the
country
and
most
of
all
she
wanted
to
know
if
charles
was
living
and
was
well
after
that
it
did
not
matter
what
became
of
her
but
now
she
knew
she
was
going
back
and
she
was
going
at
the
morning
she
went
down
to
tell
the
old
lady
her
purpose
and
after
that
she
slept
the
next
morning
she
gathered
up
her
few
belongings
and
took
the
boat
for
albany
she
had
no
settled
purpose
of
where
she
would
go
after
reaching
her
objective
point
she
did
not
know
the
name
of
the
town
where
charles
lived
strangely
enough
it
had
never
been
mentioned
in
her
hearing
and
she
had
not
thought
to
ask
she
was
beginning
to
feel
as
if
she
must
have
been
half
asleep
when
a
good
many
important
events
in
her
life
happened
was
she
half
asleep
now
also
she
wondered
idly
as
they
passed
the
old
school
of
friend
ruth
dawn
looked
out
hungrily
and
longed
inexpressibly
to
be
a
girl
again
studying
her
lessons
and
knowing
little
of
the
hardness
of
life
when
the
boat
reached
albany
she
took
the
first
stagecoach
that
appeared
without
asking
where
it
went
her
money
was
almost
gone
but
she
paid
the
fare
without
a
pang
what
did
anything
matter
now
that
she
was
out
of
new
york
everywhere
the
talk
was
of
the
cholera
and
her
heart
grew
sick
as
she
heard
the
details
of
the
dread
disease
and
long
minute
descriptions
of
how
best
to
nurse
it
the
reached
a
pretty
village
late
in
the
afternoon
and
dawn
left
it
to
take
a
walk
and
rest
herself
from
the
long
sitting
she
had
but
a
few
dollars
left
perhaps
she
ought
not
to
use
any
more
for
fare
but
stay
where
she
was
if
she
liked
it
or
walk
farther
she
did
not
feel
like
eating
anything
so
she
grasped
her
little
bundle
of
garments
and
walked
down
the
village
street
there
was
a
white
church
with
a
wide
porch
and
stairs
in
front
leading
to
the
gallery
at
the
side
was
the
graveyard
its
wicket
gate
shaded
by
a
great
weeping
willow
just
inside
was
a
seat
under
the
tree
dawn
tried
the
gate
and
found
it
unlatched
and
she
went
in
and
wandered
about
among
the
graves
reading
here
and
there
a
name
idly
and
wondering
how
it
would
seem
to
lie
down
and
sleep
in
that
quiet
resting
place
deep
in
the
centre
so
far
from
the
street
that
she
could
not
be
seen
she
sank
in
the
grass
at
the
foot
of
a
green
mound
and
laid
her
face
down
upon
the
blossoming
myrtle
how
nice
it
would
be
if
this
were
a
great
free
inn
where
strangers
might
come
and
lie
down
and
the
servants
would
bring
each
one
a
green
blanket
for
covering
and
a
white
stone
at
the
head
of
his
pillow
and
let
him
sleep
in
peace
and
quietness
forever
she
was
so
weary
so
weary
body
and
soul
at
last
she
roused
herself
and
looking
up
at
the
stone
above
her
traced
the
name
with
startled
senses
mary
montgomery
born
died
are
the
pure
in
heart
for
they
shall
see
now
indeed
dawn
was
wide
awake
this
then
was
her
mother
s
grave
she
verified
the
dates
with
her
own
memory
she
traced
the
letters
tenderly
with
her
fingers
she
took
in
the
significance
of
the
quotation
and
read
her
mother
s
story
as
she
had
never
been
told
it
by
any
one
her
mind
made
keen
by
suffering
could
understand
and
sympathize
her
young
heart
ached
with
longing
for
the
mother
who
was
gone
from
her
how
might
they
have
comforted
each
other
if
they
could
only
have
been
permitted
to
stay
together
a
little
later
she
moved
her
position
and
saw
that
there
was
a
smaller
mound
beyond
her
mother
s
grave
and
that
the
white
stone
read
carroll
montgomery
van
rensselaer
aged
years
and
months
shall
gather
the
lambs
in
his
before
this
stone
dawn
knelt
in
wonder
had
she
then
had
a
brother
and
how
much
more
of
the
story
was
there
oh
if
she
had
only
asked
her
father
more
questions
perhaps
some
day
she
would
dare
to
go
to
him
and
find
out
many
things
not
till
she
was
older
and
had
forgotten
some
of
the
troubles
she
had
borne
poor
child
she
knew
not
that
his
body
had
been
resting
beneath
a
stately
monument
these
ten
days
past
beyond
her
was
her
grandfather
s
stone
and
beside
it
her
grandmother
s
much
older
and
in
the
same
enclosure
were
many
other
montgomerys
who
had
lived
and
died
some
of
their
names
she
thought
she
remembered
she
sighed
wearily
and
going
back
to
her
mother
s
grave
touched
the
letters
of
her
name
gently
as
if
she
would
bid
them
farewell
picked
a
spray
of
the
blossoming
myrtle
and
went
sadly
out
into
a
lonely
world
again
she
could
not
stay
here
it
was
too
sorrowful
she
walked
to
the
next
village
that
afternoon
and
took
another
coach
the
first
that
came
along
going
she
knew
not
where
when
she
reached
the
end
of
the
route
the
next
morning
she
took
up
her
walk
again
resolving
to
spend
no
more
money
for
riding
she
did
not
realize
how
long
she
had
walked
but
some
time
in
the
afternoon
she
came
into
a
familiar
region
she
could
not
tell
where
she
was
at
first
but
as
she
drew
near
to
the
village
she
recognized
it
as
her
native
town
at
first
she
was
frightened
and
stopped
by
the
roadside
to
think
what
to
do
then
a
great
longing
to
see
the
garden
once
more
and
creep
into
the
old
came
over
her
skirting
the
woods
on
the
outside
of
the
village
and
going
around
by
the
she
at
last
came
to
the
hedge
at
the
lower
end
of
her
father
s
garden
and
slipped
through
to
the
as
she
had
wished
the
mansion
looked
quiet
no
one
seemed
moving
about
but
then
it
had
always
seemed
that
way
she
had
no
fear
that
any
one
would
discover
her
for
the
hedge
was
thick
and
tall
and
had
not
been
cut
lately
she
crept
into
her
old
corner
in
the
greenness
and
quiet
the
cushions
were
there
as
they
used
to
be
but
they
looked
as
if
no
one
had
been
there
in
a
long
time
she
brushed
them
off
spread
her
mantle
upon
them
and
lay
down
it
was
very
still
all
about
and
she
soon
slept
some
time
in
the
night
she
awoke
with
a
feeling
of
chill
and
loneliness
it
was
night
she
knew
by
the
darkness
and
a
sense
of
something
strange
and
sad
brooded
in
the
air
but
she
was
very
weary
and
soon
slept
again
when
she
awoke
again
it
was
late
morning
she
knew
by
the
sun
that
the
day
was
well
begun
and
she
was
impressed
almost
immediately
by
the
quietness
of
her
surroundings
there
seemed
to
be
no
one
about
not
a
sound
came
from
the
house
the
bees
and
the
cicadas
droned
and
whetted
their
hot
scythes
in
the
burning
day
but
otherwise
there
was
a
torrid
silence
the
little
hedged
was
not
far
from
the
street
it
seemed
strange
to
the
girl
that
she
heard
no
one
passing
she
got
up
and
made
herself
as
tidy
as
the
circumstances
allowed
and
then
stole
toward
the
house
keeping
within
hiding
of
the
hedges
she
had
no
mind
to
let
any
one
see
her
but
a
strange
fascination
led
her
to
look
again
upon
her
old
home
the
shutters
were
all
staring
wide
as
if
forgotten
and
the
front
door
stood
open
but
no
one
was
about
dawn
wondered
if
the
old
servants
were
still
there
but
no
sound
came
from
the
direction
of
the
kitchen
she
stole
nearer
though
her
judgment
warned
her
to
go
away
if
she
did
not
wish
to
be
seen
and
recognized
a
power
stronger
than
she
realized
seemed
drawing
her
on
with
sudden
impulse
she
stepped
softly
up
to
the
front
door
and
peeped
in
she
had
no
deep
love
for
this
old
house
for
the
memories
of
her
mother
there
had
been
dimmed
and
marred
by
later
happenings
but
dawn
had
been
a
wanderer
so
many
months
now
that
even
to
look
upon
a
place
where
she
had
once
had
a
right
to
be
was
good
the
hall
looked
much
as
ever
though
there
was
no
hat
lying
on
the
polished
mahogany
table
and
a
coating
of
dust
showed
clearly
in
the
stream
of
sunshine
from
the
front
door
her
father
s
were
not
in
their
accustomed
place
either
she
wondered
a
little
and
then
was
impressed
again
by
the
deep
stillness
that
lay
over
everything
what
could
it
mean
was
no
one
about
surely
they
had
not
gone
off
and
left
the
house
alone
and
the
front
door
wide
open
the
curious
longing
for
a
sight
of
something
familiar
which
had
brought
her
thus
far
drew
her
on
cautiously
she
stepped
into
the
hall
and
peered
into
this
room
and
parlor
the
library
the
and
back
through
the
servants
quarters
into
the
kitchen
all
were
empty
the
fire
was
out
and
a
heap
of
ashes
lay
on
the
hearth
as
if
no
one
had
made
an
attempt
to
put
things
to
rights
for
hours
there
were
unwashed
dishes
on
the
kitchen
table
and
on
the
bread
board
beside
the
knife
lay
half
a
loaf
of
bread
which
had
moulded
in
the
warm
moist
atmosphere
it
was
all
very
strange
what
could
have
happened
with
a
growing
sense
that
the
house
was
empty
now
dawn
went
upstairs
looking
first
into
her
own
old
room
and
the
guest
rooms
and
coming
at
last
to
the
door
of
that
which
had
been
her
s
it
was
closed
and
she
hesitated
to
open
it
what
need
had
she
to
go
in
there
any
way
it
could
profit
her
nothing
if
her
was
there
dawn
did
not
wish
to
see
her
the
girl
paused
an
instant
then
her
soft
tread
turned
back
again
to
go
downstairs
but
a
low
sound
like
a
moan
caught
her
ear
and
something
made
her
turn
again
and
open
the
door
though
cold
chills
were
creeping
down
her
spine
and
a
frenzy
of
fear
had
seized
upon
her
there
upon
the
high
bed
lay
her
her
eyes
sunken
into
deep
sockets
her
cheeks
hollow
her
nose
thin
and
pointed
her
whole
face
pinched
and
blue
with
lines
of
agony
in
her
expression
dawn
felt
her
heart
leap
in
fear
but
she
went
forward
there
seemed
nothing
else
to
do
the
sunken
eyes
turned
toward
her
dully
and
the
blue
lips
uttered
a
low
moan
then
suddenly
the
sick
woman
fixed
her
gaze
upon
the
girl
s
face
in
growing
horror
and
a
livid
look
came
into
her
face
is
that
you
at
last
she
asked
in
a
deep
hoarse
voice
that
sounded
strange
and
unnatural
are
we
both
dead
a
cold
perspiration
had
come
out
upon
the
girl
and
the
awfulness
of
the
situation
seemed
to
be
taking
her
senses
away
but
she
tried
to
speak
coolly
and
still
the
wild
beating
of
her
heart
yes
i
ve
come
said
dawn
but
we
re
not
dead
what
is
the
matter
are
you
sick
i
found
the
front
door
open
and
no
one
around
they
ve
all
gone
and
left
me
moaned
the
woman
beginning
to
turn
her
head
with
a
strange
restless
movement
from
side
to
side
they
rushed
off
like
frightened
cattle
you
ll
go
too
i
suppose
when
you
know
i
ve
got
the
cholera
yes
go
quick
i
don
t
want
to
do
you
any
more
harm
than
i
have
already
oh
the
sentence
broke
in
a
cry
of
agony
and
the
sick
woman
writhed
in
terrible
contortions
which
passing
left
her
weak
and
almost
lifeless
the
girl
s
heart
was
filled
with
horror
but
she
took
off
her
bonnet
and
cape
and
laid
down
her
bundle
no
i
m
not
going
to
leave
you
she
said
sadly
almost
dully
i
m
not
afraid
and
besides
it
doesn
t
matter
about
me
any
way
have
you
had
the
doctor
the
woman
shook
her
head
the
agony
was
not
all
passed
there
wasn
t
any
one
to
go
for
him
she
murmured
weakly
tossing
restlessly
again
oh
i
m
so
thirsty
can
you
get
me
some
water
where
is
father
asked
dawn
wondering
if
he
too
had
deserted
her
didn
t
you
know
he
was
dead
asked
the
sick
woman
in
that
strangely
hoarse
voice
no
said
dawn
shuddering
everybody
seemed
to
be
dying
would
she
die
too
she
hurried
to
the
old
medicine
closet
and
in
a
moment
returned
with
the
camphor
bottle
and
some
lumps
of
sugar
and
administered
several
drops
of
camphor
the
patient
s
hands
were
cold
and
blue
dawn
tucked
her
up
with
blankets
warmly
you
lie
still
she
said
in
a
tone
i
ll
get
some
hot
water
bottles
for
your
hands
and
feet
and
then
i
ll
call
the
doctor
it
isn
t
worth
while
for
you
to
stay
here
and
get
the
cholera
said
the
woman
plaintively
i
m
not
going
to
get
over
it
i
ve
known
it
all
night
it
was
coming
on
yesterday
i
tried
to
straighten
up
the
house
but
i
was
too
dizzy
and
weak
the
servants
all
went
away
when
they
heard
me
say
i
didn
t
feel
well
there
have
been
several
other
but
dawn
did
not
hear
all
her
said
for
she
had
hurried
down
to
get
a
fire
started
it
was
no
easy
task
for
her
unaccustomed
hands
to
strike
the
fire
from
the
and
after
one
or
two
fruitless
efforts
she
decided
to
waste
no
more
time
but
to
run
to
the
neighbor
s
and
borrow
a
kettle
of
water
at
the
same
time
sending
a
message
for
the
doctor
she
was
terribly
frightened
by
her
s
appearance
and
knew
she
must
be
very
ill
indeed
it
seemed
as
if
all
possible
haste
was
necessary
if
she
would
help
to
save
her
life
upstairs
the
sick
woman
was
tossing
and
moaning
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
girl
who
had
been
the
occasion
of
so
much
trouble
in
her
life
seemed
to
make
the
agony
all
the
greater
she
knew
that
she
was
face
to
face
with
death
and
now
to
have
the
girl
she
had
injured
meet
her
almost
on
the
threshold
of
the
other
world
and
minister
to
her
was
double
torment
if
only
she
could
do
something
to
make
amends
for
the
wrong
she
had
done
before
she
left
the
world
and
went
to
meet
her
just
retribution
her
fevered
brain
tried
to
think
what
was
there
she
could
do
the
girl
had
come
and
would
probably
take
the
disease
and
die
her
husband
might
never
know
she
was
here
no
one
would
find
it
out
until
she
was
dead
if
only
van
some
way
of
letting
charles
winthrop
know
that
his
wife
had
come
home
if
she
could
get
up
and
go
out
into
the
street
and
beg
some
one
to
take
him
a
message
but
her
strength
was
gone
and
the
agony
might
come
upon
her
at
any
moment
she
would
have
to
do
it
at
once
or
the
girl
would
return
and
stop
her
could
she
try
all
her
life
she
had
been
a
woman
of
iron
will
she
had
made
herself
and
every
one
except
her
husband
bend
to
it
she
summoned
it
now
she
would
try
she
would
make
one
supreme
effort
to
right
the
great
wrong
of
her
life
if
in
the
other
world
to
which
she
knew
she
was
going
in
a
few
short
hours
there
was
opportunity
to
meet
the
husband
she
had
loved
as
she
had
loved
nothing
else
on
earth
besides
herself
she
would
like
to
tell
him
that
she
had
at
the
last
hour
she
had
tried
to
make
some
amends
with
the
extraordinary
strength
which
mind
sometimes
gives
to
body
at
times
of
great
necessity
as
in
cases
of
soldiers
mortally
wounded
fighting
to
the
end
the
woman
crawled
out
of
the
bed
and
dragged
herself
over
to
the
desk
her
eyes
were
bright
with
her
great
purpose
and
blazed
like
sunken
fires
her
gray
thin
hair
straggled
down
upon
the
collar
of
the
old
she
had
put
on
when
first
taken
sick
she
seized
her
quill
pen
and
a
sheet
of
paper
that
lay
there
and
with
cramped
shaking
hand
wrote
dawn
is
here
and
signed
her
name
maria
van
rensselaer
the
scrawl
was
almost
unreadable
but
she
dared
not
try
to
write
it
over
she
dared
not
add
another
word
her
time
was
short
her
strength
already
was
failing
she
had
yet
to
get
the
message
into
some
one
s
hands
perhaps
even
now
she
would
fail
she
crushed
the
folds
together
with
her
cold
fingers
wrote
charles
winthrop
and
the
address
and
then
tottered
across
the
room
to
the
door
she
almost
fell
as
she
reached
the
the
dizzy
blinding
blackness
that
seemed
pressing
upon
her
almost
overwhelmed
her
she
felt
the
pain
and
torment
surging
back
but
she
fought
it
off
and
would
not
yield
this
was
her
last
chance
to
make
last
chance
she
said
it
over
to
herself
as
she
clung
to
the
banisters
and
got
down
the
stairs
clumsily
if
dawn
had
been
in
the
house
she
must
have
heard
her
it
looked
like
miles
to
the
front
gate
as
the
sick
woman
came
out
on
the
piazza
but
somehow
she
got
queer
ghastly
figure
of
death
clinging
to
the
with
a
letter
and
a
purse
in
her
hand
in
the
distance
she
saw
a
negro
approaching
he
was
scuttling
along
with
a
frightened
gait
as
if
he
wished
to
hurry
through
the
street
she
felt
her
strength
going
if
she
could
only
stand
up
till
he
reached
her
it
seemed
to
her
hours
before
he
came
to
the
gate
she
had
kept
back
out
of
sight
instinctively
feeling
he
would
be
scared
away
if
he
saw
her
take
that
to
the
post
office
or
god
will
punish
you
she
said
in
the
deep
hoarse
voice
the
disease
had
given
her
and
thrust
the
letter
and
the
purse
upon
him
the
negro
stopped
with
a
yell
of
fright
but
her
words
had
the
desired
effect
she
had
worked
upon
the
superstition
of
his
race
he
dared
not
disobey
her
command
taking
the
letter
and
the
purse
in
his
thumb
and
finger
that
he
might
not
come
in
contact
with
them
more
than
was
a
glance
at
the
face
of
the
woman
had
warned
him
of
her
ran
at
top
speed
to
the
his
eyes
rolled
with
horror
as
he
told
of
the
old
woman
who
had
accosted
him
he
felt
as
if
his
days
were
numbered
and
he
fled
the
village
immediately
not
caring
where
he
went
so
he
got
away
from
the
haunting
memory
of
the
living
dead
who
had
given
him
the
letter
with
almost
superhuman
effort
van
rensselaer
turned
to
go
back
to
the
house
but
the
iron
will
could
carry
her
no
further
her
strength
was
gone
she
had
accomplished
her
errand
and
had
come
to
the
end
she
had
done
her
best
to
make
amends
for
her
sin
she
sank
unconscious
by
the
gateway
meantime
dawn
had
hurried
through
the
hedge
by
a
short
cut
to
the
nearest
neighbor
s
but
failed
to
get
any
response
to
her
urgent
knock
she
went
around
the
house
and
perceived
that
it
was
closed
the
family
must
be
away
she
flew
to
the
neighbor
just
below
with
the
same
result
and
going
on
farther
down
the
street
to
four
other
houses
found
no
one
in
sight
at
the
fifth
some
distance
from
her
home
a
woman
stepped
fearfully
out
of
the
kitchen
door
and
agreed
to
send
word
to
the
doctor
but
shook
her
head
at
the
demand
for
hot
water
she
could
not
spare
her
kettle
she
had
sickness
in
the
house
herself
no
she
didn
t
think
dawn
could
get
any
at
the
next
house
either
everybody
that
could
get
away
had
gone
since
the
cholera
struck
the
town
then
the
woman
went
in
and
shut
the
door
and
with
new
horror
dawn
sped
back
to
try
her
hand
again
at
making
the
fire
the
necessity
was
so
strongly
upon
her
now
that
she
fairly
that
fire
burn
and
at
last
had
a
kettle
of
hot
water
to
carry
upstairs
dawn
was
so
intent
upon
carrying
her
great
steaming
kettle
up
the
front
stairs
without
spilling
the
contents
that
she
failed
to
hear
the
wheels
of
a
carriage
upon
the
gravel
drive
outside
it
was
not
until
she
had
carried
the
kettle
into
the
bedroom
and
put
it
on
the
hearth
and
then
turned
toward
the
bed
that
she
discovered
the
bed
was
empty
a
great
horror
filled
her
trembling
she
knew
not
why
she
quickly
glanced
into
the
other
rooms
on
that
floor
it
seemed
almost
as
if
the
pestilence
had
become
a
living
being
that
could
snatch
people
bodily
away
from
the
earth
she
seemed
to
have
no
voice
with
which
to
call
yet
she
felt
upon
her
a
necessity
of
great
haste
perhaps
her
had
gone
downstairs
in
search
of
her
she
hurried
down
a
few
steps
then
stopped
startled
someone
was
coming
into
the
front
door
staggering
under
the
heavy
burden
of
an
inert
human
form
it
looked
a
vivid
blot
of
darkness
against
the
background
of
the
hot
summer
sunshine
outside
dawn
hurried
down
with
white
face
and
horrified
eyes
and
saw
that
it
was
the
old
family
doctor
and
that
he
held
her
in
his
arms
a
sudden
pang
of
remorse
went
through
her
heart
that
she
had
been
away
from
the
sick
one
so
long
yet
how
could
she
have
helped
it
was
van
rensselaer
perhaps
trying
to
find
her
or
was
she
seeking
aid
and
had
fallen
by
the
way
oh
why
did
she
get
up
she
exclaimed
regretfully
i
came
just
as
soon
as
i
could
get
the
water
hot
then
she
caught
hold
of
the
heavy
form
of
the
unconscious
woman
and
helped
with
all
her
young
strength
to
lift
and
drag
her
up
to
her
room
again
she
might
have
been
out
of
her
head
child
said
the
doctor
kindly
as
if
in
answer
to
her
exclamation
he
was
searching
in
his
medicine
case
for
a
certain
bottle
as
he
spoke
his
breath
was
coming
in
short
quick
gasps
from
the
exertion
of
carrying
the
sick
woman
upstairs
and
the
perspiration
stood
in
great
beads
on
his
forehead
his
face
looked
old
and
haggard
and
his
voice
was
that
of
one
who
had
seen
much
recent
sorrow
he
walked
rapidly
asking
a
few
keen
questions
and
giving
brief
directions
he
nodded
approvingly
at
the
kettle
of
hot
water
sent
dawn
for
one
or
two
articles
he
needed
then
when
he
had
done
all
he
could
and
the
sick
woman
was
breathing
more
naturally
he
turned
and
looked
at
dawn
she
had
told
him
in
a
few
words
how
she
had
found
the
house
when
she
arrived
and
the
little
she
had
done
he
looked
her
through
with
his
kind
tired
eyes
noted
the
sweet
sad
face
the
dark
circles
under
her
eyes
the
pallor
of
the
thin
cheeks
and
shook
his
head
doubtfully
you
re
young
for
this
sort
of
thing
he
said
gruffly
it
s
a
hard
case
and
her
only
hope
is
good
nursing
i
m
afraid
you
re
not
equal
to
it
you
ll
break
down
yourself
oh
no
i
m
quite
strong
said
dawn
bravely
trying
to
smile
well
i
don
t
know
how
it
can
be
helped
he
mused
i
don
t
know
of
a
single
person
i
can
get
to
help
you
it
may
be
patience
howe
could
come
if
she
can
get
away
from
the
pettibones
i
ll
see
what
i
can
do
i
ll
stop
and
send
a
line
to
van
rensselaer
s
sister
she
ll
likely
come
down
by
you
know
she
was
here
when
your
father
died
do
you
think
you
could
get
along
alone
in
case
i
can
t
get
any
one
i
ll
try
to
get
back
here
before
dark
if
i
can
and
bring
some
one
to
stay
with
you
i
haven
t
had
a
wink
of
sleep
for
hours
except
what
i
caught
on
the
road
i
ll
get
back
as
soon
as
i
can
dawn
assured
him
she
would
do
her
best
though
her
heart
quaked
within
her
at
thought
of
staying
alone
with
the
sleeper
upon
the
bed
the
doctor
gave
a
few
directions
and
cautions
and
hurried
away
the
house
settled
into
quiet
and
the
hours
stretched
into
torturing
length
dawn
slipped
downstairs
to
find
some
food
for
she
was
growing
faint
with
long
fasting
but
there
was
nothing
in
the
house
fit
to
eat
the
bread
was
moist
and
sticky
with
the
damp
warm
atmosphere
and
she
had
no
heart
to
cook
anything
she
had
arranged
the
fire
to
keep
the
kettle
boiling
for
hot
water
was
an
essential
in
the
now
she
caught
sight
of
a
basket
of
eggs
and
dropped
several
into
the
boiling
water
these
would
keep
her
alive
and
be
easy
to
eat
the
afternoon
was
a
long
agony
she
spent
most
of
the
time
applying
hot
cloths
and
chafing
the
skin
of
her
from
time
to
time
the
woman
would
almost
waken
or
moan
and
toss
in
her
sleep
as
the
hot
red
sun
slipped
down
in
the
west
and
the
oppressive
darkness
settled
upon
the
house
dawn
felt
more
alone
than
she
had
ever
been
in
all
of
her
short
troublous
life
she
lighted
a
candle
and
set
it
on
the
floor
in
the
hall
as
in
the
room
it
seemed
to
trouble
the
patient
the
long
flickering
shadows
wavered
over
the
floor
in
ghostly
march
and
the
nurse
sat
and
watched
them
till
it
seemed
that
they
were
the
shadows
of
all
the
troubles
that
had
taken
their
way
through
her
young
life
it
was
late
in
the
evening
when
the
doctor
finally
returned
and
he
was
alone
but
dawn
was
glad
to
see
his
kindly
face
for
she
had
almost
given
up
hoping
for
him
that
night
and
it
seemed
terrible
to
her
to
sit
there
and
feel
that
the
death
angel
was
standing
at
the
other
side
of
the
bed
perhaps
but
the
doctor
s
eyes
brightened
a
little
as
he
looked
at
the
patient
she
s
holding
her
own
he
murmured
you
ve
done
pretty
well
little
girl
just
as
well
as
an
experienced
nurse
if
you
can
keep
it
up
during
the
night
you
may
save
her
life
i
m
sorry
i
couldn
t
get
any
one
to
stay
with
you
but
there
wasn
t
a
soul
who
was
not
already
taking
care
of
two
or
more
cases
i
d
stay
myself
but
there
are
three
cases
i
must
save
if
possible
keep
up
the
treatment
as
before
and
if
she
rouses
again
try
this
new
medicine
he
was
gone
as
quickly
as
he
had
come
and
she
was
alone
with
her
charge
once
more
but
a
new
spark
of
interest
was
in
her
work
he
had
said
she
might
save
her
s
life
she
wondered
dully
why
she
should
care
when
the
woman
had
done
her
so
much
harm
but
she
did
care
and
the
fact
gave
her
peace
while
she
thus
thought
she
was
aware
that
the
sick
woman
s
eyes
had
opened
and
were
gazing
at
her
with
a
strange
deep
wonder
as
if
they
would
ask
are
you
here
yet
have
you
stayed
alone
to
nurse
me
when
i
have
always
hated
you
and
done
you
harm
dawn
came
quickly
over
to
the
bed
and
stood
in
the
path
of
light
that
the
candle
shed
from
the
hall
doorway
she
took
the
patient
s
hands
in
her
own
and
noticed
that
they
were
not
so
cold
as
they
had
been
and
she
asked
gently
do
you
want
anything
for
a
moment
her
only
looked
at
her
and
then
her
lips
stirred
as
if
in
an
effort
to
speak
but
she
uttered
only
one
word
forgive
dawn
s
heart
bounded
with
a
sudden
unexpected
pleasure
and
the
tears
sprang
to
her
eyes
of
course
she
said
briskly
it
s
all
right
but
you
must
lie
still
and
help
get
well
a
gentler
light
came
into
van
rensselaer
s
anxious
eyes
once
more
as
if
to
make
sure
that
she
had
heard
aright
she
murmured
her
question
forgive
dawn
stooped
impulsively
and
kissed
her
then
an
actual
smile
of
peace
settled
into
the
hard
face
of
die
woman
on
the
bed
changing
it
utterly
it
s
all
right
said
dawn
again
eagerly
and
now
you
must
take
your
medicine
and
not
talk
any
more
you
are
going
to
get
well
the
doctor
says
so
and
you
must
go
to
sleep
at
once
she
administered
the
new
medicine
and
with
another
smile
like
a
tired
child
the
sick
woman
sank
away
into
a
gentle
restful
sleep
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
following
day
that
the
doctor
returned
with
van
rensselaer
s
sister
who
established
herself
by
the
bedside
with
energy
and
competence
the
doctor
noticing
dawn
s
wan
look
and
eyes
ordered
her
to
go
to
bed
at
once
or
there
would
be
two
patients
instead
of
one
to
look
after
van
rensselaer
he
pronounced
decidedly
better
dawn
as
she
slipped
away
from
the
sick
room
felt
dizzy
and
faint
with
weariness
she
reflected
that
she
would
probably
contract
the
disease
herself
and
it
might
come
upon
her
suddenly
she
had
read
of
many
cases
that
died
almost
at
once
the
thought
gave
her
no
alarm
it
would
be
good
to
go
quickly
she
went
to
her
own
room
feeling
that
she
had
come
almost
to
the
end
of
things
her
dress
was
torn
and
wet
from
much
working
with
the
hot
water
and
flannels
her
face
and
hands
were
blackened
with
soot
from
the
fire
tired
as
she
was
she
must
freshen
herself
a
little
before
going
to
sleep
she
bathed
and
dressed
in
fresh
garments
that
she
found
hanging
in
her
closet
and
put
on
the
little
white
frock
she
had
worn
the
day
before
her
marriage
smoothed
her
hair
and
then
taking
a
pillow
and
some
comfortables
from
the
bed
she
went
downstairs
the
thought
had
come
to
her
that
it
would
be
good
to
get
out
to
the
arbor
again
if
she
were
to
die
it
would
be
as
well
there
as
anywhere
as
she
passed
down
the
garden
walk
a
rose
thorn
caught
her
white
gown
and
in
freeing
herself
she
noticed
a
spray
of
roses
like
those
charles
had
picked
for
her
a
year
ago
their
fragrance
seemed
to
touch
her
tired
senses
like
healing
balm
after
she
had
spread
her
comfortables
on
the
floor
of
the
little
she
stepped
back
and
broke
off
the
spray
of
roses
and
lay
down
with
their
cool
leaves
against
her
hot
cheek
breathing
in
their
odor
she
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
in
which
no
dreams
came
to
ruffle
her
peace
she
had
not
noticed
when
she
lay
down
that
the
long
red
rays
of
the
sun
were
very
low
the
excitement
through
which
she
had
lived
the
lack
of
food
the
unusual
exertion
and
the
sudden
release
from
the
necessity
of
doing
anything
made
her
stupid
with
weariness
the
sun
slipped
quickly
down
and
the
cool
darkness
of
the
garden
soothed
her
a
tiny
breeze
gave
her
new
life
and
she
slept
as
sweetly
as
the
sleeping
birds
in
the
trees
over
her
head
while
the
kind
stars
looked
down
and
kept
watch
and
the
roses
nestled
close
and
spoke
of
him
she
loved
in
the
village
pestilence
stalked
abroad
and
the
shadow
of
death
hovered
but
in
the
garden
there
were
quiet
and
peace
and
rest
and
if
the
languid
winds
played
a
solemn
dirge
among
the
pines
near
the
old
house
they
disturbed
her
not
safe
sheltered
among
god
s
flowers
with
others
of
his
beautiful
dependent
creatures
chapter
xxvii
charles
and
dan
had
stayed
in
albany
several
days
questioning
coach
drivers
and
making
enquiries
at
all
the
inns
but
no
one
seemed
to
remember
dawn
it
happened
that
the
driver
with
whom
she
had
left
albany
had
broken
his
leg
the
very
day
after
so
he
was
not
there
to
be
questioned
heartsick
and
despairing
the
two
young
men
did
not
know
what
to
do
even
rags
was
dejected
and
whined
at
having
to
leave
the
boat
somehow
he
seemed
to
think
it
would
bring
them
to
her
if
they
but
stayed
by
it
long
enough
he
was
for
going
back
to
new
york
when
the
boat
went
and
told
the
others
so
with
a
wise
bark
but
they
heeded
him
not
he
went
about
snuffing
helplessly
and
spent
much
time
with
his
nose
in
his
paws
one
sad
blinking
eye
open
to
a
disappointing
world
they
reached
the
winthrop
home
a
few
hours
before
van
rensselaer
s
letter
arrived
it
was
betty
who
brought
the
strange
scrawled
letter
to
charles
and
she
wore
an
anxious
look
she
had
whether
she
would
not
keep
it
till
morning
he
looked
so
tired
and
worn
these
were
troublous
times
and
no
one
knew
at
night
but
that
his
dearest
friend
might
be
dead
by
morning
betty
would
have
spared
her
brother
if
she
had
dared
charles
noticed
the
postmark
and
tore
the
envelope
open
quickly
some
premonition
quickening
his
dawn
is
here
he
read
the
significant
words
then
repeated
them
aloud
his
voice
containing
a
solemn
ring
of
wonder
and
joy
could
it
be
true
betty
tell
the
boy
to
saddle
two
horses
and
have
them
ready

they
were
off
almost
immediately
for
the
willing
servant

hastened
with
the
horses
and
had
ready
a
lantern
for
their
use
when
the
moon
should
go
down
betty
handed
each
of
them
a
bottle
of
hot
broth
tightly
sealed
to
put
in
their
pockets
they
rode
through
the
night
silent
for
the
most
part
each
gravely
apprehensive
of
what
might
be
at
the
end
of
the
journey
it
was
a
strange
abrupt
message
charles
had
received
and
he
pondered
over
and
over
what
its
purport
might
be
was
dawn
sick
or
dead
why
had
not
van
rensselaer
told
him
more
perhaps
before
he
could
reach
his
wife
she
would
be
gone
again
as
before
with
this
thought
he
hurried
his
horse
once
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
sharp
abyss
within
a
few
feet
of
where
he
passed
one
misstep
and
the
journey
would
have
ended
charles
marvelled
how
he
was
going
through
unknown
dangers
without
a
thought
just
because
his
heart
was
full
of
a
great
purpose
it
was
in
the
early
morning
that
they
reached
the
village
where
the
van
rensselaers
lived
rags
was
tired
and
splashed
with
mud
his
tail
dragged
wearily
behind
him
his
head
drooped
and
his
tongue
hung
out
he
wasn
t
used
to
being
up
all
night
nor
to
travelling
on
foot
behind
fast
horses
he
thought
his
companions
must
be
crazy
to
come
away
off
here
where
there
was
no
scent
how
could
they
expect
to
know
what
they
were
doing
in
the
night
rags
wanted
a
good
juicy
bone
and
a
rug
in
a
quiet
place
as
the
two
young
men
turned
their
horses
in
at
the
great
gate
the
sound
of
the
hoofs
clattered
hollowly
and
echoed
back
in
the
empty
place
rags
mounted
the
steps
and
sat
down
looking
disconsolately
around
he
did
not
care
for
this
place
fine
though
it
might
be
he
was
dreadfully
tired
the
front
door
was
open
but
he
had
no
desire
to
investigate
charles
dismounted
and
went
into
the
house
it
struck
him
as
strange
that
the
front
door
should
be
open
so
early
in
the
morning
he
had
noticed
the
deserted
look
of
this
part
of
the
town
and
he
felt
the
chill
of
fear
grip
his
heart
had
the
cholera
reached
her
ahead
of
him
was
it
in
this
town
even
in
this
house
as
dawn
had
done
he
looked
into
the
empty
rooms
rags
got
up
and
limped
to
the
door
after
him
snuffed
around
and
then
suddenly
gave
a
short
sharp
bark
and
was
off
with
his
nose
to
the
ground
he
disappeared
among
the
down
the
and
his
young
master
sprang
off
his
horse
and
hastened
after
him
chapter
xxviii
quickly
as
dan
followed
rags
was
before
him
with
his
sharp
peculiar
bark
and
then
a
sudden
low
whine
of
fear
or
trouble
the
boy
s
heart
stood
still
and
he
hurried
the
faster
rags
came
whining
to
his
feet
as
he
reached
the
arbor
and
then
dan
saw
her
she
lay
sleeping
on
the
pile
of
comfortables
in
her
little
white
frock
with
the
spray
of
roses
in
her
hand
and
a
slight
tinge
of
color
in
her
cheek
like
the
flush
on
a
rosebud
the
comb
had
fallen
from
her
hair
and
the
beautiful
curls
lay
tumbled
out
upon
the
pillow
in
lovely
confusion
the
boy
gazed
with
awe
and
then
turned
his
head
reverently
away
but
rags
went
whining
about
her
feet
again
dan
signed
to
the
dog
to
be
still
and
bending
over
with
sudden
anxiety
watched
to
see
if
she
were
breathing
naturally
gently
as
a
child
she
slept
and
the
roses
trembled
with
her
soft
breathing
his
heart
leaped
with
joy
rags
stay
here
and
guard
her
he
commanded
sit
right
there
he
pointed
to
a
spot
in
the
garden
walk
now
be
still
rags
whined
softly
he
was
trembling
with
excitement
be
still
the
little
dog
thumped
his
tail
in
acquiescence
but
looked
wistfully
after
his
master
as
he
turned
away
and
then
at
the
sleeping
goddess
dan
hastened
back
to
the
house
the
horses
were
cropping
their
breakfast
from
the
lawn
at
the
edge
of
the
gravel
driveway
charles
was
coming
down
the
steps
his
face
white
and
drawn
dan
i
can
not
find
her
and
there
is
cholera
here
van
rensselaer
is
lying
desperately
ill
upstairs
there
is
another
woman
caring
for
her
and
she
says
dawn
has
gone
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
stood
still
dan
thought
he
was
going
to
fall
don
t
said
dan
i
ve
found
her
come
he
eagerly
drew
charles
along
the
garden
walk
oh
do
you
mean
it
are
you
sure
dan
sure
said
the
boy
rags
found
her
she
s
asleep
walk
softly
is
there
anything
the
matter
with
her
dan
said
charles
apprehensively
yet
waited
not
to
hear
the
answer
for
at
that
instant
he
reached
the
arbor
almost
stumbling
over
rags
who
jumped
upon
him
with
delight
and
wagged
and
wriggled
himself
silently
but
charles
stood
still
and
gazed
at
his
beloved
his
hungry
eyes
drank
in
her
loveliness
his
anxious
heart
searched
keenly
for
any
sign
of
illness
he
felt
himself
growing
weak
with
fear
and
joy
dan
stood
silent
behind
him
his
own
face
lighting
with
the
other
s
joy
and
solemn
rejoicing
that
they
had
found
her
not
so
rags
he
thought
the
time
had
come
for
the
princess
to
awaken
and
he
laid
a
cold
audacious
nose
in
the
open
palm
of
dawn
s
pink
hand
she
at
once
opened
her
eyes
dawn
my
darling
murmured
charles
and
dropped
upon
his
knees
beside
her
rags
was
beside
himself
with
joy
now
he
had
brought
the
teacher
to
life
but
dan
grasped
him
by
the
collar
and
drew
him
away
he
and
rags
might
rejoice
but
it
was
not
for
them
to
intrude
at
such
a
time
as
this
charles
gathered
his
young
wife
into
his
arms
laying
his
face
gently
against
hers
and
over
her
stole
a
thrill
of
deep
solemn
joy
he
had
come
after
her
he
wanted
her
she
was
loved
in
spite
of
the
way
she
had
married
him
she
was
beloved
she
closed
her
eyes
and
let
the
joy
flow
over
her
a
sweet
sweet
pain
till
almost
it
took
her
breath
away
and
brought
tears
to
her
happy
eyes
he
kissed
them
away
and
said
over
and
over
my
darling
my
darling
i
have
found
you
at
last
and
she
nestled
closer
to
him
and
hid
her
face
against
his
breast
it
seemed
a
long
time
to
rags
and
finally
he
broke
away
from
his
master
with
a
bound
and
stood
barking
joyously
at
their
feet
oh
there
is
rags
exclaimed
dawn
with
a
happy
little
laugh
dear
rags
yes
said
rags
in
his
own
way
dear
i
m
glad
i
found
you
and
dan
is
here
too
said
charles
come
here
dan
and
share
our
joy
then
came
daniel
his
face
red
with
embarrassment
and
stood
bashfully
before
her
i
found
him
and
he
s
helped
me
to
find
you
dear
said
charles
he
s
told
me
all
about
everything
all
dishevelled
as
she
was
with
her
lovely
hair
about
her
shoulders
dawn
stood
bravely
to
receive
him
and
put
out
both
hands
to
the
boy
dear
dan
she
said
she
took
his
hands
in
hers
for
an
instant
and
dan
bowed
his
head
but
he
had
nothing
to
say
he
felt
that
he
had
received
a
benediction
rags
saw
how
he
felt
about
it
and
tried
to
help
him
out
me
too
he
barked
and
dawn
laughing
stooped
and
patted
the
dog
lovingly
while
he
wriggled
himself
half
in
two
in
his
joy
but
have
you
had
any
breakfast
asked
charles
with
sweet
responsibility
in
his
tone
as
dawn
shook
back
her
curls
and
gathered
them
into
a
knot
on
her
head
fastening
them
with
her
comb
quite
properly
dan
lowered
his
eyes
deferentially
and
looked
away
from
the
pretty
sight
knowing
it
was
not
for
him
dawn
s
face
grew
grave
is
it
morning
said
she
how
could
i
have
slept
so
long
when
there
was
so
much
to
be
done
van
i
know
dear
charles
stopped
her
but
she
is
being
cared
for
the
woman
told
me
she
seemed
a
little
better
i
got
her
letter
last
evening
and
we
came
at
once
dan
and
i
we
had
been
down
to
new
york
hunting
you
and
just
missed
you
we
had
gone
home
utterly
discouraged
when
this
note
came
just
these
words
dawn
is
we
started
at
once
how
long
had
she
been
ill
the
letter
said
dawn
i
don
t
understand
i
just
came
myself
yesterday
morning
she
was
very
ill
when
i
got
here
she
couldn
t
have
mailed
any
letter
oh
it
must
be
that
she
dragged
herself
out
and
sent
it
while
i
was
hunting
hot
water
and
a
doctor
for
her
the
doctor
found
her
lying
at
the
gate
unconscious
and
brought
her
in
she
had
done
you
a
great
injury
said
charles
with
a
grave
face
but
she
almost
gave
her
life
to
make
it
right
again
said
dawn
solemnly
i
have
heard
exertion
is
usually
fatal
in
cholera
and
she
asked
me
twice
to
forgive
her
think
of
that
wasn
t
it
wonderful
but
you
don
t
know
her
and
can
t
understand
how
unlike
her
that
seems
dawn
was
crying
softly
now
and
charles
soothed
her
anxiously
you
must
put
the
thought
of
it
away
dear
or
you
will
be
ill
too
are
you
sure
you
feel
quite
well
it
was
a
terrible
experience
for
you
to
have
to
go
through
alone
come
we
must
get
you
something
to
eat
at
once
what
did
you
have
last
i
hope
you
ate
nothing
that
had
been
around
the
i
ate
two
boiled
eggs
said
dawn
smiling
through
her
tears
it
was
all
i
could
find
and
i
was
too
tired
to
make
a
fire
dear
child
said
charles
but
it
was
the
best
thing
you
could
have
done
i
guess
dan
there
s
that
broth
we
brought
along
betty
put
up
enough
for
a
regiment
we
will
go
to
the
kitchen
and
make
a
fire
said
dawn
you
must
have
breakfast
too
you
have
had
a
long
hard
ride
yes
breakfast
barked
rags
impolitely
charles
grew
grave
at
once
now
dawn
you
must
not
go
near
that
house
again
you
have
been
sufficiently
exposed
already
dan
and
i
will
bring
you
some
breakfast
i
don
t
like
the
idea
of
your
eating
anything
that
comes
out
of
that
house
it
isn
t
safe
couldn
t
we
make
a
little
fire
there
at
the
edge
of
the
woods
and
warm
that
broth
if
we
had
a
tin
there
s
a
saucepan
in
the
kitchen
said
dawn
i
ll
go
and
get
it
you
ll
stay
right
here
said
dan
in
his
kindly
gruff
way
go
and
get
it
before
they
could
stop
him
he
had
gone
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
returned
with
a
pail
of
water
a
a
saucepan
and
three
cups
then
he
gathered
sticks
and
he
and
charles
made
the
fire
rigging
up
a
kind
of
crane
to
hold
the
kettle
soon
they
had
hot
water
to
pour
over
the
dishes
and
then
dawn
heated
the
broth
and
they
each
had
a
good
cupful
even
rags
had
a
few
spoonfuls
though
he
sat
up
quite
politely
at
a
word
from
dan
with
his
head
cocked
sideways
and
a
knowing
look
as
much
as
to
say
serve
yourselves
first
and
i
ll
lick
the
dishes
after
all
it
was
dan
who
did
everything
for
them
he
told
charles
that
it
was
best
he
should
stay
with
his
wife
and
guard
her
there
was
no
telling
but
she
might
get
sick
or
something
and
it
was
not
safe
for
her
to
be
left
alone
just
now
besides
it
was
charles
s
business
to
care
for
her
and
for
that
reason
he
must
keep
out
of
danger
himself
what
would
happen
to
dawn
if
charles
should
get
the
cholera
but
you
might
get
it
yourself
dan
and
we
d
never
forgive
ourselves
aw
said
dan
turning
away
in
scorn
don
t
you
worry
bout
so
dan
had
his
way
when
the
doctor
came
he
agreed
with
charles
that
dawn
should
be
gotten
away
at
once
into
a
high
healthy
region
by
this
time
van
rensselaer
s
brother
had
arrived
with
a
faithful
family
servant
there
was
no
need
to
stay
van
rensselaer
had
roused
herself
to
add
her
voice
of
urgency
that
dawn
go
at
once
away
from
contagion
so
they
hitched
their
horses
to
the
big
van
rensselaer
carriage
and
rode
away
on
a
second
wedding
journey
attended
by
dan
and
rags
two
faithful
servitors
once
during
the
afternoon
when
dan
had
left
them
for
a
few
minutes
they
had
looked
after
him
lovingly
dear
dan
said
charles
i
don
t
know
what
i
should
have
done
without
him
he
must
have
his
college
course
how
would
you
like
to
have
us
send
him
to
harvard
as
a
sort
of
for
what
he
has
done
for
us
and
dawn
smiled
happily
into
her
husband
s
eyes
as
she
answered
oh
how
beautiful
could
we
they
planned
it
all
out
briefly
then
and
that
evening
at
the
setting
of
the
sun
as
they
rode
forth
from
the
village
toward
the
high
cool
hills
where
waited
the
little
white
house
charles
broached
the
subject
to
dan
charles
and
dawn
were
in
the
back
seat
dan
driving
in
front
with
rags
at
his
feet
with
his
head
held
proudly
as
if
he
had
always
ridden
in
a
carriage
with
two
gray
horses
dan
said
charles
leaning
forward
a
little
that
he
might
the
better
see
the
boy
s
face
when
dawn
and
i
go
back
to
cambridge
in
the
fall
for
my
last
year
at
harvard
we
re
going
to
take
you
with
us
rags
smiled
widely
he
had
heard
the
talk
in
the
afternoon
and
he
expected
to
go
to
college
himself
dan
turned
with
a
radiant
awed
face
and
grasped
charles
s
hand
could
i
he
asked
eagerly
could
i
you
may
need
some
preparation
said
charles
wouldn
t
it
be
a
good
idea
for
you
to
come
up
to
our
house
in
the
hills
and
let
me
coach
you
how
about
it
dawn
we
have
always
room
for
dan
haven
t
we
and
dawn
smiling
and
happy
assured
the
boy
that
he
would
always
be
welcome
later
when
charles
drew
dawn
s
head
down
upon
his
shoulder
in
the
darkness
put
his
arm
close
about
her
and
with
his
free
hand
held
both
of
hers
there
was
tender
joy
and
thankfulness
dan
and
rags
up
in
front
knew
that
there
were
depths
of
happiness
in
the
back
seat
not
for
them
but
they
were
content
for
were
they
not
going
to
college
and
in
company
with
the
two
they
loved
best
of
all
a
week
later
charles
and
dawn
stood
together
on
the
hillside
in
front
of
their
own
little
house
it
was
very
early
in
the
morning
and
off
beyond
another
hill
the
sun
was
just
flashing
into
great
red
disc
against
a
sky
of
amethyst
and
opal
hill
valley
winding
river
and
every
tree
and
shrub
were
touched
with
the
glory
of
the
dawn
they
were
watching
dan
ride
away
to
his
home
to
gather
his
belongings
and
prepare
his
family
for
the
new
order
of
his
life
in
the
afternoon
betty
was
to
arrive
by
she
was
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
hot
weather
in
the
cool
hills
with
them
until
the
cholera
had
disappeared
this
was
their
first
time
absolutely
alone
together
since
they
had
known
each
other
they
stood
silent
watching
the
gray
figure
of
horse
and
man
as
it
proceeded
slowly
down
the
hillside
and
disappeared
among
the
trees
in
the
shadowy
road
where
night
was
yet
lurking
slowly
slowly
the
sun
slipped
up
until
a
great
ball
of
ruby
light
grew
into
a
brilliant
glory
their
eyes
could
not
look
upon
and
stretched
before
them
lay
the
day
with
all
its
radiant
possibilities
and
he
shall
be
as
the
light
of
the
morning
when
the
sun
riseth
even
a
morning
without
clouds
as
the
tender
grass
springing
out
of
the
earth
by
clear
shining
after
rain
quoted
charles
solemnly
they
involuntarily
drew
