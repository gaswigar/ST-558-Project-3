preface
this
the
third
volume
of
the
history
of
the
peninsular
war
covers
a
longer
period
than
either
of
its
predecessors
extending
over
the
sixteen
months
from
wellington
s
arrival
at
badajoz
on
his
retreat
from
talavera
to
the
deadlock
in
front
of
santarem
which
marked
the
end
of
masséna
s
offensive
campaign
in
portugal
it
thus
embraces
the
central
crisis
of
the
whole
war
the
arrival
of
the
french
in
front
of
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
and
their
first
short
retreat
after
they
had
realized
the
impossibility
of
forcing
that
impregnable
barrier
to
their
advance
the
retreat
that
began
at
sobral
on
the
night
of
was
to
end
at
toulouse
on
april
the
armies
of
the
emperor
were
never
able
to
repeat
the
experiment
of
and
to
assume
a
general
and
vigorous
offensive
against
wellington
and
portugal
in
they
were
on
the
defensive
despite
of
certain
local
and
partial
attempts
to
recover
their
lost
initiative
in
they
had
to
abandon
half
spain
andalusia
estremadura
asturias
la
mancha
and
much
more
despite
of
wellington
s
temporary
check
before
burgos
in
they
were
swept
across
the
pyrenees
and
the
bidassoa
in
they
were
fighting
a
losing
game
in
their
own
land
rightly
then
may
masséna
s
retreat
to
santarem
be
called
the
beginning
of
the
end
though
it
was
not
for
a
full
year
more
that
wellington
s
final
offensive
commenced
with
the
investment
of
ciudad
rodrigo
on
the
campaign
of
bussaco
and
torres
vedras
therefore
marked
the
of
the
whole
war
and
i
have
endeavoured
to
set
forth
its
meaning
in
full
detail
devoting
special
care
to
the
explanation
of
wellington
s
triple
device
for
arresting
the
french
advance
his
combination
of
the
system
of
devastation
of
the
raising
of
the
en
in
portugal
and
of
the
construction
of
great
defensive
lines
in
front
of
lisbon
each
of
these
three
measures
would
have
been
incomplete
without
the
other
two
for
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
might
not
have
saved
portugal
and
europe
from
the
domination
of
napoleon
if
the
invading
army
had
not
been
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
the
light
screen
of
irregular
troops
which
cut
its
communications
and
prevented
it
from
foraging
far
afield
nor
would
masséna
have
been
turned
back
if
the
land
through
which
he
had
advanced
had
been
left
unravaged
and
if
every
large
village
had
contained
enough
food
to
subsist
a
brigade
for
a
day
or
a
battalion
for
a
week
the
preparations
the
advance
and
the
retreat
of
masséna
cover
about
half
of
this
volume
the
rest
of
it
is
occupied
with
the
operations
of
the
french
in
northern
eastern
and
southern
spain
operations
which
seemed
decisive
at
the
moment
but
which
turned
out
to
be
mere
in
the
great
contest
for
soult
s
conquest
of
andalusia
and
suchet
s
victories
in
aragon
catalonia
and
valencia
only
distracted
the
imperial
generals
from
their
central
task
the
expulsion
of
wellington
and
his
army
from
the
peninsula
most
readers
will
i
think
find
a
good
deal
of
new
information
in
the
accounts
of
the
siege
of
gerona
and
the
battle
of
ocaña
the
credit
due
to
alvarez
for
the
defence
of
the
catalonian
city
has
never
been
properly
set
forth
before
in
any
english
history
nor
have
the
details
of
areizaga
s
miserable
campaign
in
la
mancha
been
fully
studied
in
particular
the
composition
and
strength
of
his
army
have
never
before
been
elucidated
and
appendices
v
vi
of
this
volume
consist
of
absolutely
unpublished
documents
i
have
to
offer
my
grateful
thanks
to
those
who
have
been
good
enough
to
assist
me
in
the
writing
of
this
book
by
furnishing
me
with
stores
of
private
papers
or
hitherto
unknown
official
reports
two
of
the
kind
helpers
who
put
me
on
the
track
of
new
information
for
the
compiling
of
volume
ii
have
passed
away
while
volume
iii
was
in
progress
i
bitterly
regret
the
loss
of
my
friends
general
arteche
and
colonel
whinyates
the
former
with
his
unrivalled
knowledge
of
the
contents
of
the
historical
department
of
the
madrid
war
office
had
enabled
me
to
discover
many
a
lost
document
of
importance
the
latter
had
placed
at
my
disposal
his
copious
store
of
papers
letters
and
diaries
relating
to
his
old
corps
the
royal
artillery
in
this
present
section
of
the
history
of
the
war
i
am
still
using
much
of
the
material
which
he
lent
me
but
new
helpers
have
come
to
my
aid
while
this
volume
was
being
written
to
three
of
them
i
must
express
my
special
gratitude
the
first
is
d
urban
of
newport
house
near
exeter
who
has
furnished
me
with
copies
of
a
collection
of
papers
of
unique
interest
the
diary
and
correspondence
of
his
grandfather
sir
benjamin
d
urban
who
served
as
the
of
the
portuguese
army
under
marshal
beresford
during
the
two
years
covered
by
this
section
of
my
history
thanks
to
the
mass
of
documents
furnished
by
d
urban
s
kindness
i
am
now
in
a
position
to
follow
the
details
of
the
organization
movements
and
exploits
of
the
portuguese
army
in
a
way
that
had
hitherto
been
impossible
to
me
moreover
sir
benjamin
s
day
by
day
criticisms
on
the
strategy
and
tactics
both
of
masséna
and
of
wellington
have
the
highest
interest
as
reflecting
the
opinions
of
the
more
intelligent
section
of
the
staff
it
is
noteworthy
to
find
that
while
many
of
wellington
s
chief
subordinates
despaired
of
the
situation
in
there
were
some
who
already
felt
an
enthusiastic
confidence
in
the
plans
of
their
leader
so
much
so
that
their
criticisms
were
reserved
for
the
occasions
when
in
their
opinion
he
showed
himself
and
refused
to
take
full
advantage
of
the
uncomfortable
positions
into
which
he
had
lured
his
enemy
the
second
mass
of
interesting
private
papers
placed
in
my
hands
of
late
is
the
personal
correspondence
of
nicholas
trant
and
john
wilson
the
two
enterprising
leaders
of
portuguese
militia
forces
to
whom
wellington
had
entrusted
the
cutting
off
of
masséna
s
communication
with
spain
and
the
restriction
of
his
raids
for
sustenance
to
feed
his
army
these
letters
have
been
lent
me
by
commander
bertram
chambers
of
a
collateral
relative
of
wilson
they
fill
up
a
gap
in
the
military
history
of
for
no
one
hitherto
had
the
opportunity
of
following
out
in
detail
the
doings
of
these
two
adventurous
soldiers
and
trusty
friends
while
they
were
engaged
in
the
difficult
task
that
was
set
them
for
a
sample
of
trant
s
breezy
style
of
correspondence
i
may
refer
the
reader
to
pages
of
this
volume
unfortunately
when
the
two
militia
generals
were
in
actual
contact
their
correspondence
naturally
ceased
so
that
the
series
of
letters
has
many
but
they
are
nevertheless
of
the
highest
value
thirdly
i
have
to
thank
sir
henry
le
marchant
for
a
sight
of
the
private
papers
of
his
grandfather
the
cavalry
brigadier
general
john
gaspar
le
marchant
who
fell
at
salamanca
he
did
not
land
in
the
peninsula
till
but
during
the
preceding
year
he
was
receiving
many
letters
of
interest
some
from
his
own
contemporaries
officers
of
high
rank
in
wellington
s
army
others
from
younger
men
who
had
been
his
pupils
while
he
was
in
command
of
the
military
college
at
high
wycombe
some
of
the
seniors
and
one
especially
were
among
those
men
of
the
opposite
type
to
benjamin
d
urban
who
were
consistently
expecting
disaster
and
looked
for
a
hasty
embarkation
at
lisbon
as
the
natural
end
of
the
campaign
of
the
younger
men
took
a
very
different
view
of
affairs
and
invariably
sent
cheerful
accounts
of
the
doings
of
the
army
i
must
mention
once
more
kind
assistance
from
the
officials
of
the
historical
sections
of
the
war
ministries
at
paris
and
at
madrid
my
friend
commandant
balagny
who
gave
me
so
much
help
during
the
compilation
of
my
second
volume
has
unfortunately
been
absent
on
a
military
mission
to
brazil
during
the
last
three
years
but
the
kind
offices
of
martinien
have
continually
aided
me
in
getting
access
to
the
particular
sections
of
the
paris
archives
with
which
i
was
from
time
to
time
concerned
i
must
here
take
the
opportunity
of
expressing
once
more
my
admiration
for
his
colossal
work
the
des
officiers
tués
et
blessés
pendant
les
guerres
de
l
which
on
the
numberless
occasions
when
no
appears
in
the
paris
archives
enables
one
to
determine
what
regiments
were
present
at
any
action
and
in
what
proportion
they
suffered
at
madrid
captain
emilio
figueras
has
continued
his
kind
services
offered
during
the
compilation
of
my
second
volume
and
was
indefatigable
in
going
through
the
papers
of
with
me
during
my
two
visits
to
the
spanish
capital
among
my
english
helpers
i
must
cite
with
special
gratitude
four
names
the
first
is
that
of
atkinson
fellow
of
exeter
college
oxford
who
has
read
the
proofs
of
the
greater
part
of
this
volume
and
given
me
many
valuable
corrections
and
pieces
of
information
from
his
wide
knowledge
of
british
regimental
history
the
second
is
that
of
major
john
leslie
who
has
compiled
the
artillery
appendix
to
this
section
corresponding
to
that
which
colonel
whinyates
compiled
for
the
last
i
am
also
most
grateful
to
him
for
an
early
view
of
the
useful
dickson
papers
which
he
is
publishing
for
the
royal
artillery
institution
the
third
is
that
of
the
rev
alexander
craufurd
who
has
continued
to
give
me
notes
on
the
history
of
the
light
division
while
it
was
commanded
by
his
grandfather
the
famous
robert
craufurd
the
fourth
is
that
of
doble
of
the
clarendon
press
who
has
again
read
for
errors
every
page
of
a
long
volume
lastly
the
indefatigable
compiler
of
the
index
must
receive
once
more
my
heartfelt
thanks
for
a
labour
of
love
the
reader
will
find
several
topographical
notes
appended
at
the
end
of
chapters
the
results
of
my
first
and
second
tours
along
the
borderland
of
spain
and
portugal
two
long
visits
to
the
battlefield
of
bussaco
and
some
days
spent
between
the
coa
and
the
agueda
and
behind
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
gave
me
many
new
topographical
facts
of
importance
drives
and
walks
in
the
country
and
about
coimbra
also
turned
out
most
profitable
but
my
notes
on
the
battlefields
of
fuentes
d
oñoro
and
albuera
can
only
be
utilized
in
my
next
volume
which
i
trust
may
not
be
long
in
following
its
predecessor
into
print
the
spelling
of
many
of
the
spanish
and
more
especially
the
portuguese
names
may
appear
unfamiliar
to
some
readers
but
i
believe
that
correctness
should
be
studied
above
all
things
even
though
the
results
in
cases
like
bussaco
with
the
double
s
golegão
or
santa
comba
dao
may
produce
a
momentary
shock
to
the
eye
portuguese
spelling
both
in
personal
names
and
in
topography
was
in
a
state
of
flux
in
for
example
the
general
commanding
the
artillery
always
appears
as
da
rosa
in
the
official
army
lists
yet
signed
his
name
da
roza
countless
other
instances
could
be
produced
where
it
was
possible
i
have
followed
the
individual
s
own
version
of
his
name
he
ought
to
have
known
best
there
are
still
no
doubt
errors
of
spelling
surviving
no
man
is
infallible
but
i
have
done
my
best
to
reduce
them
to
a
minimum

introductory
the

wellesley
and
wellington
between
the
of
august
when
robert
craufurd
s
light
brigade
withdrew
from
the
bridge
of
almaraz
to
follow
the
rest
of
the
british
army
across
the
mountains
to
the
neighbourhood
of
badajoz
and
february
when
part
of
that
same
brigade
was
engaged
in
the
first
skirmish
of
barba
del
puerco
not
a
shot
was
fired
by
any
of
wellington
s
troops
this
gap
of
over
six
months
in
his
active
operations
may
appear
extraordinary
and
it
was
bitterly
criticized
at
the
time
between
august
and
march
there
was
hard
fighting
both
in
the
south
of
spain
and
along
the
frontier
of
portugal
but
the
british
army
despite
many
invitations
took
no
part
in
it
wellington
adhered
to
his
resolve
never
to
commit
himself
again
to
a
campaign
in
company
with
the
spaniards
unless
he
should
be
placed
in
a
position
in
which
he
could
be
independent
of
the
freaks
of
their
government
and
the
perversity
of
their
generals
two
months
experience
of
the
impracticability
of
cuesta
of
the
deliberate
disobedience
of
venegas
of
the
fruitless
promises
of
the
lozano
de
torres
of
the
insane
demands
and
advice
sent
in
by
the
central
junta
had
convinced
him
that
he
dare
not
risk
his
army
in
a
second
venture
such
as
that
which
had
led
him
to
talavera
if
he
were
made
by
the
spanish
government
and
granted
a
free
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
spanish
armies
matters
would
look
different
but
there
was
at
present
no
chance
whatever
that
he
would
receive
such
a
mark
of
confidence
only
a
small
minority
of
the
leading
men
at
seville
could
endure
with
patience
the
idea
of
a
british
wellington
himself
had
long
dismissed
the
project
which
frère
had
broached
in
the
spring
as
impracticable
not
it
must
be
remembered
to
become
the
light

pp
meanwhile
the
french
advance
had
no
sooner
ceased
after
the
rather
objectless
combat
of
arzobispo
than
the
junta
began
to
press
upon
the
british
general
schemes
for
a
resumption
of
the
offensive
and
a
second
march
toward
madrid
the
political
situation
and
not
any
military
considerations
was
the
originating
cause
of
their
untimely
activity
they
felt
that
their
authority
was
waning
that
their
popularity
had
vanished
that
their
critics
were
daily
growing
more
venomous
and
they
saw
that
success
in
the
war
would
be
the
only
possible
way
out
of
their
difficulties
hence
at
the
very
moment
when
wellington
was
withdrawing
his
army
from
the
tagus
and
impeaching
in
letters
of
stinging
irony
the
conduct
of
the
junta
s
mendacious
commissaries
he
was
being
pressed
to
resume
the
offensive
countless
appeals
were
made
to
him
both
formal
and
argumentative
invitations
from
the
ministers
at
seville
and
private
remonstrances
by
individuals
spanish
and
english
were
showered
upon
him
the
junta
even
went
so
far
as
to
offer
him
command
of
the
spanish
troops
in
estremadura
though
this
offer
was
qualified
by
their
statement
that
they
intended
to
reduce
those
troops
to
men
the
larger
half
of
the
army
being
under
orders
to
march
eastward
into
la
mancha
and
join
the
force
of
venegas
this
proposal
did
not
in
the
least
meet
wellington
s
main
objection
to
resuming
active
operations
viz
that
he
could
not
trust
the
spanish
government
to
feed
his
army
nor
the
spanish
generals
to
carry
out
with
punctual
accuracy
any
scheme
for
a
joint
campaign
which
might
be
laid
before
him
he
put
the
matter
very
plainly
till
the
evils
of
which
i
think
that
i
have
reason
to
complain
are
remedied
till
i
see
magazines
established
for
the
supply
of
the
troops
and
a
regular
system
adopted
for
keeping
them
filled
till
i
see
an
army
upon
whose
exertions
i
can
depend
commanded
by
officers
capable
and
willing
to
carry
into
execution
the
operations
which
have
been
planned
by
mutual
agreement
i
can
not
enter
upon
any
system
of
with
the
spanish
armies
this
statement
was
for
publication
in
private
correspondence
with
his
brother
the
ambassador
at
seville
he
added
still
more
cogent
reasons
for
declining
to
take
the
field
with
venegas
or
eguia
he
had
witnessed
with
his
own
eyes
the
panic
of
portago
s
division
on
the
night
before
talavera
when
whole
corps
threw
away
their
arms
and
ran
off
in
my
presence
while
neither
attacked
nor
threatened
with
attack
but
frightened
i
believe
by
their
own
fire
he
had
seen
albuquerque
s
cavalry
the
day
after
the
combat
of
arzobispo
lurking
in
every
village
for
twenty
miles
round
and
had
heard
spanish
officers
telling
of
nineteen
or
twenty
actions
of
the
same
description
as
that
of
arzobispo
an
account
of
which
i
believe
has
never
been
the
army
of
estremadura
consisted
he
concluded
of
troops
by
no
means
to
be
depended
upon
on
every
ground
therefore
he
ought
to
avoid
risking
the
king
s
army
again
in
such
company
see
for
an
account
of
an
interview
with
the
marquis
of
malaspina
and
lord
macduff
who
had
come
to
badajoz
to
make
personal
representation
which
wellington
much
resented
wellington
to
wellesley
for
stronger
language
about
the
rash
folly
of
spanish
generals
see
wellington
to
beresford
ibid
wellington
to
wellesley
from
merida
there
was
no
getting
over
this
fundamental
objection
of
wellington
s
and
his
brother
therefore
was
placed
in
a
very
uncomfortable
position
during
all
his
negotiations
with
the
central
junta
lord
wellesley
s
task
indeed
was
a
most
invidious
one
he
had
been
directed
by
his
government
to
profess
an
earnest
desire
to
aid
the
spaniards
in
bringing
the
war
to
a
successful
conclusion
and
to
pledge
the
aid
of
great
britain
yet
he
was
forced
to
refuse
every
definite
proposal
made
to
him
by
the
junta
on
the
other
hand
there
were
clauses
in
his
instructions
which
provoked
the
most
suspicion
and
resentment
when
he
touched
upon
them
in
his
conversations
with
martin
de
garay
and
the
other
spanish
ministers
such
were
the
proposal
to
place
the
whole
spanish
army
under
a
british
commander
wellington
the
attempt
to
open
up
the
subject
of
a
certain
measure
of
free
trade
with
spanish
america
and
most
of
all
the
offer
to
send
british
troops
to
garrison
cadiz
for
despite
the
fiasco
of
the
preceding
winter
the
portland
ministry
were
still
harping
on
this
old
string
and
allusions
to
it
occur
in
nearly
every
dispatch
sent
from
london
to
the
ambassador
at
seville
see
canning
s
instruction
to
wellesley
of
june
on
pages
of
wellesley
s
and
lond
wellesley
s
position
was
made
even
more
difficult
by
the
fact
that
all
the
spanish
factions
opposed
to
the
central
junta
tried
to
draw
him
into
their
schemes
by
making
lavish
professions
of
what
they
were
ready
to
do
if
only
the
present
government
were
evicted
from
office
of
these
factions
there
were
many
the
old
council
of
castile
which
the
junta
had
superseded
still
clung
together
making
protests
as
to
the
legality
of
their
successor
s
position
the
local
assemblies
were
equally
jealous
of
the
central
authority
the
juntas
of
estremadura
and
valencia
in
especial
were
always
intriguing
behind
its
back
and
the
former
at
least
made
many
tempting
proposals
both
to
wellesley
and
to
wellington
but
the
most
dangerous
enemies
of
the
existing
government
were
the
malcontents
close
at
its
gates
the
andalusian
conspirators
led
by
the
members
of
the
old
junta
of
seville
and
by
the
intriguers
like
the
conde
de
montijo
the
dukes
of
infantado
and
ossuna
and
francisco
palafox
the
dissatisfaction
caused
by
the
incapacity
indecision
and
as
it
was
openly
said
the
nepotism
and
venality
of
the
junta
was
so
general
that
a
plan
was
formed
in
seville
to
seize
them
deport
them
all
to
the
canaries
and
proclaim
a
regency
the
troops
in
the
place
were
tampered
with
some
demagogues
were
ready
to
raise
the
mob
and
infantado
who
was
in
the
thick
of
the
plot
came
to
wellesley
one
night
to
divulge
the
arrangements
for
the
pronunciamento
and
to
bespeak
his
aid
much
as
he
disliked
the
junta
and
its
methods
the
ambassador
scornfully
refused
to
make
himself
a
member
of
a
conspiracy
and
after
warning
infantado
of
his
intention
went
straight
to
the
secretary
garay
and
gave
him
all
the
information
as
to
the
project
though
without
divulging
any
names
some
of
the
plotters
fled
others
were
arrested

much
as
every
patriot
should
deprecate
the
employment
of
d
while
a
foreign
war
is
on
hand
there
was
much
to
excuse
the
conduct
of
the
enemies
of
the
junta
that
body
was
now
more
than
a
year
old
it
had
been
from
the
first
regarded
as
a
as
a
provisional
government
which
was
destined
to
give
place
to
something
more
regular
and
constitutional
when
occasion
should
serve
a
committee
of
public
safety
which
fails
to
preserve
the
state
stands
and
the
history
of
the
central
junta
had
been
one
record
of
consistent
disaster
a
body
of
over
thirty
persons
is
too
large
for
a
ministry
too
small
for
a
representative
assembly
every
intelligent
spaniard
whatever
his
politics
was
desirous
of
seeing
it
give
place
to
a
regular
government
the
conservatives
and
bureaucrats
would
have
been
contented
if
it
had
appointed
a
regency
of
four
or
five
persons
and
then
abdicated
the
liberals
demanded
that
it
should
summon
the
national
cortes
and
leave
to
that
body
the
creation
of
an
executive
pamphlets
were
showered
by
dozens
from
the
press
now
more
or
less
free
for
the
first
time
in
spanish
history
to
advocate
one
or
other
of
these
courses
the
junta
however
had
no
intention
of
surrendering
its
power
whatever
pretence
of
disinterestedness
it
might
assume
and
proclaim
its
first
attempts
to
put
off
the
evil
day
when
it
must
yield
to
public
opinion
were
ingeniously
absurd
it
issued
as
early
as
may
a
proclamation
acknowledging
the
advisability
of
summoning
a
cortes
and
then
invited
all
spaniards
to
send
in
schemes
and
suggestions
during
the
next
two
months
concerning
the
best
way
in
which
the
national
assembly
could
be
organized
and
the
reforms
and
constitutional
improvements
which
it
should
take
in
hand
these
documents
were
to
be
read
and
pondered
over
by
a
commission
mainly
composed
of
members
of
the
junta
which
was
to
issue
a
report
in
due
time
embodying
the
best
of
the
suggestions
and
the
results
of
its
own
discussion
this
was
an
admirable
device
for
wasting
time
and
putting
off
the
assembly
of
the
cortes
the
commission
finally
decided
on
september
after
many
weeks
of
session
that
a
supreme
executive
council
of
five
persons
should
be
appointed
carefully
avoiding
the
name
of
regency
but
only
existing
members
of
the
central
junta
were
to
be
eligible
as
councillors
and
the
council
was
to
be
changed
at
short
intervals
till
every
member
of
the
junta
had
taken
a
turn
in
it
the
only
laudable
clause
of
this
scheme
was
one
providing
that
spanish
america
should
be
represented
in
the
junta
and
therefore
ultimately
in
the
executive
council
the
arrangement
satisfied
nobody
it
merely
substituted
a
rapidly
changing
committee
of
the
junta
for
the
whole
of
that
body
as
the
supreme
ruling
power
and
it
was
clear
that
the
orders
of
the
council
would
be
those
of
the
junta
though
they
might
be
voiced
by
fewer
mouths
the
assembly
of
the
cortes
would
be
put
off
for
the
text
of
this
wordy
proclamation
see
wellesley
s
pp
note
the
extraordinary
similarity
of
this
plan
to
that
produced
by
the
athenian
oligarchs
in
had
some
one
been
reading
thucydides
any
effect
which
the
report
of
the
commission
might
have
had
was
spoilt
by
the
fact
that
it
was
followed
by
a
minority
report
or
manifesto
drawn
up
by
the
marquis
of
la
romana
who
had
been
one
of
the
commissioners
the
junta
had
called
him
back
from
galicia
and
compelled
him
to
surrender
the
army
that
he
had
under
the
pretext
that
he
had
been
as
a
member
of
their
own
body

been
created
in
the
representation
of

he
had
been
named
to
fill
it
summoned
to
seville
and
placed
on
the
constitutional
commission
dissenting
from
every
word
of
the
report
of
the
majority
he
published
on
october
a
in
which
he
declared
that
the
venality
nepotism
and
dilatory
incapacity
of
the
junta
made
it
necessary
for
spain
to
seek
a
new
executive
which
should
be
wholly
independent
of
that
body
accordingly
he
suggested
that
a
regency
of
five
members
should
be
constituted
as
the
supreme
governing
body
of
the
realm
no
member
of
the
junta
was
to
sit
therein
it
was
to
be
assisted
for
consultative
purposes
by
a
body
of
six
persons
one
of
whom
was
to
be
a
south
american
this
second
committee
to
be
called
the
permanent
deputation
of

realm
was
to
be
considered
to
represent
the
cortes
till
that
assembly
should
meet
it
was
not
to
meddle
with
executive
matters
but
was
to
devote
itself
to
drawing
up
the
details
of
the
constitution
of
the
future
cortes
and
to
suggesting
practical
reforms
so
far
as
the
declaration
in

of

regency
went

liked
la
romana
s
scheme
and
it
obtained
wellesley
s
approval
also
but
the
idea
of
the
permanent
deputation
frightened
the
liberals
who
feared
that
its
existence
would
be
made
the
excuse
for
putting
off
the
summoning
of
the
cortes
for
an
indefinite
time
moreover
it
was
rumoured
that
la
romana
intended
to
resign
his
seat
in
the
junta
and
to
become
a
candidate
for
the
position
of
senior
regent
so
that
his
proposals
must
be
intended
to
benefit
himself
the
suspicion
that
his
personal
ambitions
inspired
his
patriotic
denunciation
of
the
junta
s
misdoings
was
made
the
more
likely
by
events
that
occurred
at
the
same
moment
in
valencia
there
the
leading
personage
of
the
moment
was
the
governor
general
josé
caro
the
younger
brother
of
la
romana
who
had
complete
control
of
the
local
junta
and
exercised
what
his
enemies
called
a
tyranny
in
the
province
he
and
his
following
were
already
on
the
worst
terms
with
the
seville
government
and
now
took
the
opportunity
of
bursting
out
into
open
rebellion
they
issued
a
sounding
manifesto
against
the
supreme
junta
declared
their
intention
of
refusing
to
obey
it
any
longer
and
republished
and
sent
in
all
directions
to
the
other
local
juntas
la
romana
s
report
in
favour
of
a
regency
of
which
caro
had
struck
off
copies
they
threatened
to
turn
back
by
force
general
castro
whom
the
supreme
junta
had
sent
to
supersede
caro
and
declared
their
second
representative
in
that
body
the
conde
de
contamina
deposed
for
disobedience
to
the
will
of
the
it
looked
as
if
la
romana
might
be
intending
to
overthrow
the
central
government
by
means
of
his
brother
s
valencian
army
apparently
he
must
be
acquitted
of
this
charge
his
fiery
and
ambitious
kinsman
having
gone
far
beyond
his
intentions
in
the
midst
of
all
these
intrigues
plots
and
manifestos
the
central
junta
had
only
one
hope
to
rehabilitate
themselves
by
means
of
a
great
military
success
with
ruinous
consequences
they
tried
to
direct
the
course
of
the
war
with
political
rather
than
strategical
ends
in
view
of
the
unhappy
autumn
campaign
which
their
rashness
precipitated
we
shall
speak
in
its
proper
place
but
before
narrating
the
disasters
of
ocaña
and
alba
de
tormes
we
must
turn
back
for
some
months
to
consider
the
situation
of
eastern
spain
where
the
continuous
chronicle
of
events
has
been
conducted
no
further
than
blake
s
rout
at
belchite
in
june
and
cyr
s
victory
of
valls
in
february
much
had
happened
in
catalonia
and
aragon
even
before
the
day
of
talavera
much
more
was
to
take
place
before
the
november
campaign
of
the
junta
s
armies
in
new
castile
and
leon
had
begun
this
is
a
military
history
for
the
war
of
pamphlets
and
manifestos
plots
and
intrigues
between
the
seville

and
its

events
in

spain
during
the
summer
and
autumn
of
the
siege
of
gerona
begun
in
the
spring
of
the
theatres
of
operations
of
the
two
french
entrusted
with
the
reduction
of
aragon
and
of
catalonia
were
still
divided
by
a
broad
belt
of
territory
which
was
in
the
hands
of
the
spaniards
around
the
fortresses
of
lerida
mequinenza
and
tortosa
only
once
had
communication
been
opened
between
suchet
and
cyr
and
then
the
force
which
had
crossed
from
aragon
into
catalonia
found
itself
unable
to
return
the
only
way
of
getting
a
dispatch
from
saragossa
to
barcelona
was
to
send
it
by
the
circuitous
road
through
france
between
the
and
the
corps
would
have
been
difficult
in
any
case
but
since
each
of
the
two
was
interested
in
his
own
problems
alone
and
found
them
the
war
in
catalonia
and
the
war
in
aragon
went
on
during
and
the
first
half
of
as
separate
affairs
from
the
french
point
of
view
it
was
otherwise
with
the
spaniards
blake
had
been
placed
in
command
of
the
whole
of
the
the
three
provinces
of
valencia
aragon
and
catalonia
which
had
formed
the
ancient
kingdom
of
aragon
he
had
suchet
on
his
left
and
cyr
on
his
right
was
equally
interested
in
the
operations
of
each
and
might
so
far
as
the
rules
of
strategy
go
have
turned
his
main
force
against
whichever
of
the
two
he
might
please
leaving
a
comparatively
small
force
to
contain
the
other
unfortunately
he
proved
unable
to
make
head
against
either
of
his
adversaries
we
have
already
seen
how
in
the
early
summer
he
threw
himself
upon
suchet
and
was
beaten
off
at
maria
and
routed
at
belchite
in
the
later
months
of
the
year
it
was
mainly
with
cyr
that
he
had
to
deal
and
his
efforts
were
equally
unsuccessful
it
would
seem
that
he
found
it
very
difficult
to
concentrate
any
preponderant
portion
of
his
troops
for
a
blow
to
either
side
very
few
battalions
from
catalonia
accompanied
his
valencians
and
aragonese
to
maria
very
few
valencians
were
brought
up
to
aid
the
catalans
in
the
operations
about
gerona
the
problems
of
food
and
transport
had
something
to
do
with
this
but
the
main
difficulty
was
that
the
armies
of
both
provinces
more
especially
the
catalans
were
essentially
local
levies
and
disliked
being
drawn
far
from
their
homes
there
was
always
some
threatening
danger
in
their
own
district
which
made
them
loath
to
leave
it
unguarded
while
they
were
taken
off
on
some
distant
expedition
the
complaints
and
arguments
of
the
juntas
the
manifest
unwillingness
of
the
officers
and
men
fettered
the
hands
of
the
whenever
he
strove
to
accomplish
a
general
concentration
hence
it
came
to
pass
that
for
the
most
part
cyr
was
opposed
by
catalan
troops
only
suchet
by
valencians
and
aragonese
only
during
the
campaigns
of
catalonia
had
been
added
to
his
command
after
reding
died
of
wounds
received
at
the
battle
of
valls
the
tasks
of
the
commander
of
the
corps
in
the
months
that
followed
his
victories
over
blake
were
both
less
interesting
and
less
important
than
those
imposed
upon
his
colleague
in
catalonia
they
were
however
laborious
enough
after
having
driven
the
spanish
regular
armies
out
of
aragon
suchet
had
now
to
tame
the
for
even
after
belchite
he
held
little
more
than
the
towns
of
saragossa
and
jaca
and
the
ground
on
which
his
camps
were
pitched
from
day
to
day
when
he
had
concentrated
his
corps
to
fight
blake
the
rest
of
the
province
had
slipped
out
of
his
hands
its
reconquest
was
a
tedious
matter
even
though
he
had
only
to
contend
with
scattered
bands
of
peasants
stiffened
by
stragglers
from
the
army
that
had
dispersed
after
belchite
the
plain
of
the
ebro
which
forms
the
central
strip
of
aragon
was
easily
subdued
but
the
mountains
to
the
north
and
south
were
well
fitted
to
be
the
refuge
of
insurgents
the
aragonese
along
with
the
galicians
were
the
first
of
the
spaniards
to
take
to
systematic
guerrilla
warfare
undismayed
by
the
fate
of
blake
s
army
they
had
resolved
to
defend
themselves
to
the
last
there
was
more
than
one
focus
of
resistance
a
colonel
renovales
who
had
been
one
of
the
defenders
of
saragossa
and
had
escaped
after
the
capitulation
was
at
the
head
of
the
bands
of
the
mountains
in
the
vale
of
roncal
and
on
the
borders
of
navarre
in
the
region
about
the
upper
waters
of
the
cinca
and
the
hills
beyond
jaca
two
local
chiefs
named
perena
and
sarasa
kept
the
war
on
foot
getting
their
stores
and
ammunition
from
the
catalans
on
the
side
of
lerida
in
an
entirely
distinct
part
of
the
province
south
of
the
ebro
lay
gayan
and
villacampa
whose
centres
of
activity
were
daroca
and
molina
mountain
towns
from
which
they
were
often
driven
up
into
that
central
ganglion
of
all
the
ranges
of
spain
the
sierra
de
albaracin
from
which
descend
in
diverging
directions
the
sources
of

tagus
the
guadalaviar
and
the
xucar
both
gayan
and
villacampa
were
officers
of
the
regular
army
holding
commissions
under
blake
the
band
of
the
former
had
as
its
nucleus
the
regiment
of
la
princesa

escape

northern

combat

been

during

and
the
autumn
of
was
to
break
up
and
as
far
as
possible
to
destroy
these
bands
his
success
was
considerable
but
not
complete
in
july
he
stormed
gayan
s
stronghold
the
mountain
sanctuary
of
nuestra
señora
del
aguila
captured
his
magazines
and
drove
him
up
into
the
mountains
of
molina
continuing
his
campaign
south
of
the
ebro
he
sent
the
pole
chlopiski
against
villacampa
who
abandoned
calatayud
daroca
and
the
other
hill
towns
and
retired
into
the
sierra
de
albaracin
where
he
took
refuge
at
the
remote
convent
of
el
tremendal
one
of
the
most
spots
in
the
whole
peninsula
here
nevertheless
the
partisan
was
followed
up
on
by
a
column
under
colonel
henriot
who
manœuvred
him
out
of
his
position
surprised
him
by
a
night
attack
and
drove
him
over
the
valencian
border
the
convent
was
blown
up
the
dependent
village
of
orihuela
sacked
and
the
french
withdrew
for
an
excellent
personal
diary
of
all
these
operations
see
general
von
brandt
s
meinem
pp
he
accuses
suchet
of
grossly
exaggerating
both
in
his
dispatches
and
his
memoirs
the
difficulty
and
importance
of
these
mountain
raids
see
suchet
s
pp
for
a
highly
picturesque
narrative
the
insurgents
were
still
unskilled
in
arms
shot
very
poorly
kept
bad
watch
and
were
given
to
panic
that
there
is
something
in
brandt
s
criticism
seems
to
be
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
whole
division
of
musnier
lost
between
july
and
only
three
officers
killed
and
eight
wounded
out
of
present
with
the
eagles
in
six
months
of
incessant
raids
and
skirmishes
see
martinien
s
des
often
quoted
before
these
operations
had
been
carried
out
by
musnier
s
division
but
meanwhile
movements
of
a
very
similar
sort
were
being
undertaken
by
another
division
that
of
laval
on
the
other
side
of
aragon
along
the
slopes
and
gorges
of
the
pyrenees
in
the
end
of
august
a
column
of
men
stormed
the
convent
of
san
juan
de
la
peña
close
to
jaca
which
sarasa
and
renovales
were
wont
to
make
their
head
quarters
it
was
an
ancient
building
containing
the
tombs
of
the
early
kings
of
aragon
who
reigned
in
the
mountains
before
saragossa
had
been
recovered
from
the
moor
it
had
never
seen
an
enemy
for
eight
hundred
years
and
was
reputed
holy
and
impregnable
hence
its
capture
dealt
a
severe
blow
to
the
confidence
of
the
insurgents
renovales
however
held
out
in
the
western
upland
continuing
to
defend
himself
in
the
valley
of
roncal
till
he
was
beset
on
all
sides
for
suchet
had
obtained
leave
from
paris
to
call
up
the
national
guards
of
the
ariége
basses
pyrénées
and
haute
garonne
and
their
d
attacked
the
insurgents
in
the
rear
from
across
the
high
mountains
while
the
corps
advanced
against
them
from
the
front
after
much
scattered
fighting
renovales
capitulated
on
condition
that
he
should
be
allowed
a
free
departure
he
retired
to
catalonia
with
some
of
his
men
the
rest
dispersed
for
the
moment
but
only
to
reassemble
a
few
weeks
later
under
another
and
a
more
wary
and
obstinate
chief
the
younger
mina
who
commenced
in
this
same
autumn
to
make
the
borders
of
aragon
and
navarre
the
theatre
of
his
hazardous
exploits
but
the
region
was
comparatively
quiet
in
september
and
october
and
suchet
transferred
the
activity
of
his
movable
column
further
to
the
eastward
where
he
drove
some
out
of
the
valleys
of
the
cinca
and
essera
and
tried
to
open
up
a
new
line
of
communication
with
france
by
way
of
the
valley
of
venasque
this
was
accomplished
for
a
moment
by
the
aid
of
national
guards
from
beyond
the
pyrenees
who
entered
the
valley
from
the
north
while
the
troops
of
suchet
were
operating
from
the
south
but
the
road
remained
unsafe
and
could
only
be
used
for
the
passage
of
very
large
bodies
of
troops
so
that
it
was
practically
of
little
importance
suchet
s
third
division
that
of
habert
was
lying
out
in
the
direction
of
the
cinca
and
the
guadalupe
watching
lest
blake
might
make
a
new
sally
from
tortosa
or
lerida
in
december
suchet
completed
the
formal
conquest
of
aragon
by
moving
up
the
whole
of
laval
s
division
into
the
district
of
teruel
in
the
extreme
of
the
province
the
only
part
of
it
that
had
never
yet
seen
the
french
eagles
the
junta
of
aragon
fled
from
thence
over
the
border
of
the
kingdom
of
valencia
but
villacampa
and
his
bands
remained
in
the
mountains
unsubdued
and
while
they
continued
to
exist
the
conquest
of
the
upland
was
incomplete
the
moment
that
its
towns
ceased
to
be
held
by
large
garrisons
it
was
clear
that
the
insurgents
would
descend
to
reoccupy
them
nevertheless
suchet
had
done
much
in
this
year
besides
the
crushing
of
blake
he
had
accomplished
the
complete
subjection
of
the
plains
of
central
aragon
and
had
obtained
a
grip
upon
its
two
mountain
regions
he
had
fortified
monzon
fraga
alcañiz
and
caspe
as
outposts
against
the
catalans
and
having
received
large
drafts
from
france
in
the
autumn
was
on
the
last
day
of
the
year
at
the
head
of
a
fine
corps
of
men
from
which
he
might
hope
to
produce
in
the
next
spring
a
field
army
sufficient
for
offensive
operations
against
catalonia
or
valencia
after
providing
garrisons
for
his
various
posts
of
strength
the
weak
point
of
his
position
was
that
the
guerrilleros
had
learned
caution
refused
for
the
future
to
fight
save
under
the
most
favourable
conditions
and
devoted
themselves
to
the
safe
and
vexatious
policy
of
intercepting
communications
and
cutting
up
small
parties
and
stragglers
they
were
much
harder
to
deal
with
when
once
they
had
learnt
that
not
even
in
fastnesses
like
el
tremendal
or
san
juan
de
la
peña
was
it
wise
to
offer
the
french
battle
unless
suchet
left
a
garrison
in
every
town
nay
in
every
considerable
village
of
the
sierras
the
insurgents
dominated
the
whole
region
if
he
did
take
such
measures
for
holding
down
the
upland
he
was
forced
to
immobilize
a
very
large
proportion
of
his
army
we
shall
note
that
in
he
was
only
able
to
draw
out
of
his
men
for
the
invasion
of
western
catalonia
the
corps
which
had
gone
down
to
little
over
men
in
may
counted
on
the
following
force
division
laval
musnier
habert
cavalry
brigade
artillery
and
engineers

of
alcañiz

permanently
embodied
pyrenean
national
guards
total
of
these
were
effectives
present
with

the
remainder
were
in
hospital
or
detached
while
the
commander
of
the
corps
was
making
steady
progress
with
the
conquest
of
aragon
the
fortunes
of
his
colleague
of
the
corps
had
been
far
more
chequered
indeed
for
the
greater
part
of
cyr
was
brought
to
a
complete
standstill
by
the
unexpected
obstinacy
of
the
gallant
garrison
of
gerona
who
for
no
less
than
eight
months
kept
the
main
body
of
the
army
of
catalonia
detained
in
front
of
their
walls
when
last
we
dealt
with
the
operations
in
this
region
we
left
cyr
victorious
at
the
battle
of
valls
after
which
he
advanced
into
the
plain
of
tarragona
made
some
demonstrations
against
that
fortress
but
returned
after
a
few
weeks
to
barcelona
march
without
having
made
any
serious
attempt
to
turn
his
victory
to
practical
account
this
retreat
after
a
brilliant
success
may
be
compared
to
victor
s
similar
evacuation
of
southern
estremadura
after
medellin
and
was
brought
about
in
the
main
by
the
same
cause
want
of
supplies
for
when
he
had
consumed
the
resources
of
the
district
between
valls
and
tarragona
cyr
had
no
means
of
providing
his
army
with
further
subsistence
barcelona
his
base
could
not
feed
him
for
the
city
was
itself
on
the
edge
of
famine
it
was
still
beset
to
north
and
west
by
the
local
miqueletes
who
had
returned
to
their
old
haunts
when
the
main
french
army
had
gone
off
southward
on
the
campaign
of
valls
it
was
stringently
blockaded
on
the
sea
side
by
the
british
mediterranean
fleet
and
it
could
not
draw
food
from
france
by
land
because
the
to
perpignan
passed
through
the
fortress
of
gerona
which
was
still
in
spanish
hands
cyr
himself
it
will
be
remembered
had
only
reached
barcelona
by
turning
off
on
to
side
tracks
through
the
mountain
and
winning
his
way
down
to
the
shore
by
the
battle
of
cardadeu
till
gerona
should
fall
and
the
garrison
of
barcelona
be
placed
in
direct
communication
with
france
there
was
little
use
in
making
ambitious
offensive
movements
against
tarragona
or
any
other
point
in
southern
or
central
catalonia
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
reduce
gerona
and
so
to
bring
the
division
left
behind
under
reille
in
the
ampurdam
and
on
the
frontier
of
roussillon
into
free
communication
with
the
remainder
of
the
corps
from
the
moment
when
cyr
passed
the
mountains
during
the
winter
reille
had
been
fighting
out
a
petty
campaign
against
the
northern
catalans
which
had
no
connexion
whatever
with
his
superior
s
operations
at
molins
de
rey
and
valls
and
had
little
definite
result
of
any
kind
no
one
saw
more
clearly
than
napoleon
the
need
for
the
reduction
of
gerona
as
early
as
january
he
had
issued
orders
both
to
cyr
and
to
reille
to
prepare
for
the
enterprise
but
cyr
was
now
out
of
touch
and
reille
was
far
too
weak
in
the
early
spring
to
dream
of
any
such
an
adventure
he
had
been
left
no
more
than
seven
depleted
battalions
to
maintain
his
hold
on
northern
catalonia
when
cyr
took
the
rest
of
the
army
across
the
hills
to
barcelona
the
emperor
was
not
slow
to
realize
that
the
corps
must
be
reinforced
on
a
large
scale
he
did
so
by
sending
thither
in
the
spring
of
a
brigade
of
berg
troops
four
battalions
the
regiment
of
würzburg
two
battalions
and
a
division
seven
battalions
of
westphalians
it
will
be
noted
that
now
as
always
he
was
most
chary
of
drafting
native
french
troops
to
catalonia
and
always
fed
the
war
in
that
direction
with
auxiliaries
in
whose
fate
he
was
little
interested
the
campaign
in
eastern
spain
was
after
all
but
a
side
issue
in
the
main
struggle
when
these
reinforcements
had
arrived
reille
began
to
collect
material
at
bascara
on
the
fluvia
to
which
laboriously
dragged
across
the
pyrenees
were
added
several
companies
of
heavy
artillery
and
sappers
were
brought
up
from
france

imperial
minute
of
cyr
meanwhile
four
weeks
after
his
retreat
from
the
plain
of
tarragona
moved
on
to
vich
upon
april
with
the
divisions
of
souham
pino
lecchi
and
chabot
leaving
duhesme
with
his
original
french
division
which
had
held
barcelona
since
the
outbreak
of
the
war
in
charge
of
his
base
of
operations
his
departure
was
partly
designed
to
spare
the
stores
of
barcelona
where
the
pinch
of
famine
was
beginning
to
be
felt
for
he
intended
to
subsist
his
army
on
the
upland
plain
of
vich
a
rich
district
hitherto
untouched
by
the
war
but
a
few
days
after
he
had
marched
forth
barcelona
was
freed
from
privation
by
the
lucky
arrival
of
a
squadron
of
victuallers
from
toulon
convoyed
by
admiral
cosmao
which
had
put
to
sea
in
a
storm
and
eluded
the
british
blockading
squadron
april
the
position
of
vich
however
had
been
chosen
by
cyr
not
only
for
reasons
of
supply
but
because
the
place
was
happily
situated
for
covering
the
projected
siege
of
gerona
against
any
interruption
by
blake
if
the
spanish
brought
up
the
wrecks
of
the
old
catalan
army
from
tarragona
with
his
valencian
levies
added
he
would
almost
certainly
take
the
inland
road
by
manresa
and
vich
since
the
was
practically
barred
to
him
by
the
french
occupation
of
barcelona
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
commencement
of
the
leaguer
of
gerona
was
not
vexed
by
any
such
interruption
for
blake
had
his
eyes
fixed
on
saragossa
in
may
and
june
and
was
so
far
from
dreaming
of
an
assault
on
cyr
that
he
drew
off
part
of
the
catalan
army
for
his
unhappy
invasion
of
aragon
which
finished
with
the
disaster
of
belchite
during
the
early
months
of
this
long
siege
the
only
external
helpers
of
the
garrison
of
gerona
were
the
small
force
of
regulars
under
the
swiss
wimpfen
and
the
miqueletes
of
claros
and
rovira
from
the
ampurdam
reille
s
opponents
during
the
spring
at
tarragona
the
marquis
of
coupigny
the
senior
officer
now
in
catalonia
had
no
more
than
men
left
of
reding
s
old
army
and
was
helpless
to
interfere
with
cyr
who
had
some
men
concentrated
at
vich
the
preparations
for
the
siege
therefore
went
on
in
the
end
of
april
and
the
beginning
of
may
without
any
hindrance
save
from
the
normal
bickerings
of
the
french
outlying
detachments
with
the
local
which
never
ceased
around
vich
matters
were
particularly
lively
for
the
whole
population
of
the
town
and
the
surrounding
plains
had
gone
up
into
the
hills
where
they
wandered
miserably
for
three
months
much
hunted
by
french
foraging
parties
which
they
occasionally
succeeded
in
destroying
cyr
opened
up
his
communications
with
reille
by
sending
to
him
lecchi
s
italian
division
which
cut
its
way
amid
constant
skirmishes
along
the
banks
of
the
ter
to
gerona
and
met
the
troops
from
the
ampurdam
under
its
walls
reille
had
moved
forth
from
bascara
on
may
and
on
the
eighth
expelled
the
spanish
outposts
from
all
the
villages
round
the
fortress
not
without
some
lively
skirmishing
he
had
brought
up
some
infantry
including
his
own
old
division
and
all
the
newly
arrived
germans
with
some
artillerymen
and
engineers
almost
at
the
same
moment
arrived
dispatches
from
paris
announcing
that
the
emperor
just
before
departing
for
the
austrian
war
had
superseded
both
cyr
and
reille
being
discontented
with
their
handling
of
affairs
in
catalonia
it
is
unfortunate
that
no
statement
in
detail
of
his
reasons
appears
in
the
but
it
would
seem
that
he
thought
that
the
victories
of
molins
de
rey
and
valls
should
have
had
greater
results
disapproved
of
cyr
s
retreat
from
in
front
of
tarragona
and
thought
that
reille
had
shown
great
weakness
in
dealing
with
the
insurgents
of
the
ampurdam
he
ignored
the
special
difficulties
of
the
war
in
catalonia
thinking
that
the
men
of
the
corps
ought
to
have
sufficed
for
its
complete
conquest
indeed
he
showed
his
conception
of
the
general
state
of
affairs
by
recommending
cyr
in
march
to
undertake
simultaneously
the
sieges
of
gerona
tarragona
and
tortosa
the
leaguer
of
one
and
that
the
smallest
of
these
places
was
destined
to
occupy
the
whole
army
of
catalonia
when
largely
reinforced
for
eight
months
if
it
had
been
cut
up
according
to
the
imperial
mandate
it
is
probable
that
at
least
one
of
its
sections
would
have
been
destroyed
cyr
wrote
in
his
memoirs
that
his
master
was
jealous
of
him
and
wished
to
see
him
fail
even
at
the
cost
of
wrecking
the
corps
this
is
of
course
absurd
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
emperor
disliked
his
lieutenant
all
the
more
because
of
the
long
string
of
complaints
and
of
demands
for
more
men
money
and
stores
which
he
was
now
receiving
week
by
week
from
catalonia
he
loved
generals
who
achieved
the
impossible
and
hated
grumblers
and
a
class
to
which
cyr
despite
all
his
talents
undoubtedly
belonged
it
is
possible
that
napoleon
s
determination
to
replace
him
may
have
been
fostered
by
intrigues
on
the
part
of
the
officer
to
whom
the
corps
was
now
turned
over
marshal
augereau
had
served
with
great
credit
in
the
old
republican
campaign
in
catalonia
during
and
imagined
himself
to
have
a
profound
knowledge
of
the
country
and
was
anxious
to
try
his
hand
in
it
it
was
many
years
since
he
had
been
trusted
with
an
independent
command
both
in
the
wars
of
and
in
that
of
he
had
been
lost
in
the
ranks
of
the
grand
army
his
nomination
to
supersede
cyr
was
made
early
in
may
but
on
his
way
to
the
seat
of
war
he
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
the
gout
and
was
detained
in
bed
at
perpignan
for
many
weeks
thus
his
predecessor
though
apprised
of
his
disgrace
was
obliged
to
continue
in
command
and
to
commence
the
operations
of
which
the
marshal
as
he
well
knew
would
take
all
the
credit
at
the
same
moment
reille
was
displaced
by
verdier
the
general
who
had
conducted
the
first
unlucky
siege
of
saragossa
an
experience
which
seems
to
have
made
him
very
cautious
when
dealing
with
spaniards
behind
walls
there
is
only
a
short
note
in
dispatch
no
see
of
this
vol
see
cyr
to
berthier
march
and
cyr
s
lecchi
s
division
forced
its
way
back
to
cyr
on
may
bringing
him
the
intelligence
of
his
supersession
but
at
the
same
time
apprising
him
that
augereau
would
not
arrive
as
yet
and
that
the
duty
of
commencing
the
siege
of
gerona
would
still
fall
to
his
lot
at
the
same
time
verdier
sent
letters
urging
that
his
infantry
formed
too
small
a
force
to
surround
such
a
large
fortress
and
that
he
must
ask
for
reinforcements
from
the
covering
army
if
they
were
denied
him
he
should
refuse
to
begin
the
siege
throwing
the
responsibility
for
this
disobedience
of
the
emperor
s
commands
on
his
superior
he
had
reported
the
situation
to
paris
cyr
was
incensed
at
the
tone
of
this
dispatch
above
all
at
the
fact
that
verdier
was
appealing
straight
to
the
emperor
instead
of
corresponding
through
his
hierarchical
superior
according
to
the
rules
of
military
etiquette
but
he
saw
that
verdier
had
a
good
case
and
he
had
just
learnt
that
blake
had
turned
off
against
aragon
so
that
no
trouble
from
that
quarter
need
be
feared
accordingly
he
very
grudgingly
sent
back
lecchi
s
division
to
gerona
it
was
the
worst
that
he
possessed
being
composed
of
no
more
than
four
neapolitan
and
three
italian
battalions
with
a
strength
of
little
over
bayonets
he
added
to
it
a
regiment
of
italian
light
horse
several
of
his
own
batteries
and
nearly
all
the
engineers
and
sappers
of
his
corps
so
that
the
total
reinforcement
sent
to
verdier
consisted
of
more
than
men
it
may
be
found
printed
in
full
in
the
appendix
to
the
narrative
of
the
siege
of
gerona
in
belmas
s
vol
ii
pp
bayonets
and
two
squadrons
of
italian
light
horse
by
the
return
of
may
the
neapolitans
were
bad
troops
deserting
whenever
it
was
safe
to
do
so
having
received
these
succours
which
brought
up
his
total
force
to
infantry
and
cavalry
and
artillerymen
sappers
and
engineers
verdier
commenced
on
may
his
operations
against
gerona
on
that
day
lecchi
s
division
took
its
post
in
the
plain
of
salt
on
the
west
of
the
town
while
the
french
and
westphalian
divisions
were
already
close
to
the
place
on
its
eastern
and
northern
sides
the
head
quarters
and
the
french
brigades
of
joba
and
guillot
lay
by

the
magazines
were
established
while
the
germans
had
been
sent
up
on
to
the
heights

of

held

the
rocky
southern
side
of
gerona
in
the
direction
of
the
gorge
of

not
yet
properly
invested
something
has
already
been
said
in
an
earlier
volume
of
this
work
concerning
the
situation
of
gerona
when
its
two
earlier
sieges
by
duhesme
were
narrated
it
must
suffice
to
repeat
here
that
the
town
is
built
on
the
steep
of
two
lofty
heights
with
the
river
oña
at
its
foot
the
stream
is
crossed
by
two
bridges
but
is
fordable
everywhere
save
in
times
of
spate
beyond
it
lies
the
suburb
of
the
mercadal
surrounded
by
fortifications
which
form
an
integral
part
of
the
defences
of
the
city
the
river
ter
coming
from
the
west
joins
the
oña
at
the
north
side
of
the
mercadal
and
washes
the
extreme
corner
of
the
walls
of
the
city
proper
the
two
heights
upon
whose
lower
slopes
gerona
is
built
are
separated
from
each
other
by
a
deep
ravine
called
the
galligan
down
which
run
an
intermittent
watercourse
and
a
road
the
only
one
by
which
approach
to
the
city
from
the
east
is
possible
the
northern
height
is
crowned
by
the
strong
fort
of
monjuich
the
most
formidable
part
of
the
city
defences
with
its
three
outlying
redoubts
called
san
narciso
san
luis
and
san
daniel
the
crest
of
the
southern
height
is
covered
in
a
similar
fashion
by
the
three
forts
of
the
capuchins
queen
anne
and
the
constable
with
the
calvary
redoubt
lower
down
the
slope
above
the
galligan
facing
san
daniel
on
the
other
side
of
the
ravine
two
other
small
fortifications
the
redoubts
of
the
chapter
and
the
city
cover
the
path
which
leads
down
from
the
forts
to
gerona
neither
the
monjuich
nor
the
capuchin
heights
are
isolated
hills
each
is
the
end
of
a
spur
running
down
from
the
higher
mountains
but
while
the
southern
summit
rises
high
above
the
hilly
reach
which
joins
it
to
the
mountain
of
nuestra
señora
de
los
angeles
the
northern
summit
where
lies
monjuich
is
at
the
end
of
a
plateau
extending
far
to
the
north
the
capuchin
heights
therefore
can
only
be
attacked
uphill
while
monjuich
can
be
assailed
from
ground
of
a
level
little
inferior
to
itself
but
except
on
this
point
both
heights
are
very
strong
their
slopes
being
in
many
places
absolutely
precipitous
especially
towards
the
galligan
and
everywhere
steep
nevertheless
there
are
winding
paths
leading
up
both
from
sarria
and
in
the
case
of
monjuich
from
casa
de
selva
and
other
villages
towards
the
east
and
the
sea
in
the
case
of
the
capuchin
heights
all
the
ground
is
bare
rock
with
no
superincumbent
soil

all
the
fortifications
were
somewhat
antiquated
in
type
nothing
having
been
done
to
modernize
the
defences
since
the
war
of
the
spanish
succession
ferdinand
vi
and
charles
iii
had
neglected
gerona
in
favour
of
the
new
fortress
of
figueras
nearer
to
the
frontier
on
which
large
sums
had
been
expended
for
the
benefit
of
the
french
who
seized
it
by
treachery
in
and
were
now
using
it
as
their
base
of
operations
the
actual
wall
of
enceinte
of
the
city
was
mediaeval
a
plain
rampart
feet
high
too
narrow
for
artillery
and
set
thickly
with
small
towers
only
at
its
two
ends
on

the
ter
two
bastions
called
those
of
la
merced

this
weakness
of
the
walls
went
for
little
so
long
as
monjuich
the
capuchins
and
the
other
forts
held
firm
since
the
enemy
could
only
approach
the
at
its
two
ends
where
the
bastions
lay
far
more
dangerous
was
the
feebleness
of
the
mercadal

ramparts
formed
the
southern
section
of
the
exterior
defences
of

its
circuit
had
five
plain
bastions

no

other
outer
defences
no
covered

its

only
some
eighteen

twenty
feet
high
was
visible
across
the
flat
ground
which

it
from
the

to
the
summit
of
the
wall
for
want
of
ditch
or
glacis
the
ground
leading
up
to
it
was
favourable
for
siege
approaches
since
the
soil
was
soft
and
easy
to
dig
and
was
seamed
with
hollow
roads
and
stone
walls
giving
much
cover
to
an
assailant
aware
of
the
defects
of
the
fortifications
of
the
mercadal
the
spaniards
had
prepared
a
line
of
defence
behind
it
along
the
further
bank
of
the
oña
they
had
made
the
of
the
city
proper
defensible
to
a
certain
extent
by
building
up
the
doors
and
windows
of
all
the
houses
which
abut
upon
the
water
mining
the
two
bridges
and
fixing
a
stockade
and
entanglements
in
the
bed
of
the
oña
along
the
considerable
space
where
it
is
fordable
in
dry
weather
they
had
indeed
repaired
the
whole
circuit
of
the
defences
since
duhesme

sieges
of
having
cleared
out
the
ditches
of
monjuich
and
of
the
bastions
of
la
merced

santa
maria
walled
up
many

repaired

and
solid
masonry
all
the
parts
of
the
walls
that
had
been
dilapidated
at
the
moment
of
the
first
siege
they
had
also
pulled
down
many
isolated
houses
outside
the
walls
and
demolished
the
nearer
half
of
the
suburban
village
of
pedret
which
lies
most
inconveniently
for

this

vii
belmas
and
vacani
do
not
seem
to
have
known
of
this
fact
as
each
of
them
makes
the
remark
that
if
the
mercadal
had
been
taken
a
sudden
rush
might
have
taken
the
assailants
across
the
shallow
river
and
into
the
old
town
it
may
be
remarked
that
there
had
once
been
a
but
that
most
of
it
had
been
allowed
to
fall
into
decay
when
the
mercadal
was
taken
into
the
city
defences
all
these
precautions
must
be
put
to
the
credit
of
the
governor
mariano
alvarez
de
castro
a
man
to
be
mentioned
with
all
honour
and
respect
and
probably
the
best
soldier
that
spain
produced
during
the
whole
peninsular
war
he
was
a
veteran
of
the
revolutionary
and
portuguese
wars
and
had
a
good
reputation
but
no
special
credit
for
military
science
down
to
the
moment
when
he
was
put
to
the
test
he
had
been
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
castle
of
barcelona
on
the
occasion
when
it
was
seized
by
duhesme
in
march
his
spirit
had
been
deeply
wounded
by
that
vile
piece
of
treachery
and
he
had
at
once
adhered
to
the
national
cause
since
then
he
had
been
serving
in
the
ampurdam
against
reille
till
the
moment
when
he
was
appointed
governor
of
gerona
alvarez
is
described
by
those
who
served
under
him
as
a
severe
taciturn
man
of
a
puritan
cast
of
mind
i
should
call
him
wrote
one
of
his
brigadiers
an
officer
without
the
true
military
talents
but
with
an
extreme
confidence
in
providence
almost
one
might
say
a
believer
in
miracles
his
soul
was
great
capable
of
every
sacrifice
full
of
admirable
constancy
but
i
must
confess
that
his
heroism
always
seemed
to
me
that
of
a
christian
martyr
rather
than
of
a
professional
soldier
general
fournas
who
wrote
this
somewhat
depreciatory
sketch
of
his
chief
was
one
of
those
who
signed
the
capitulation
while
alvarez
was
moaning
quiero
on
his
so
that
his
judgement
is
hardly
to
be
taken
as
unprejudiced
but
his
words
point
the
impression
which
the
governor
left
on
his
subordinates
the
details
of
his
defence
sufficiently
show
that
he
was
a
skilful
and
resourceful
as
well
as
an
obstinate
general
his
minute
care
to
utilize
every
possible
means
of
defence
prove
that
he
was
no
mere
waiter
on
miracles
that
he
was
a
very
devout
practising
catholic
is
evident
from
some
of
his
doings
at
the
opening
of
the
siege
a
great
religious
ceremony
was
held
at
which
the
local
patron
saint
narcissus
was
declared
captain
of
the
city
and
presented
with
a
sword
the
levy
of
the
citizens
was
called
the
crusade
and
their
badge
was
the
red
cross
the
ideas
of
religion
and
patriotism
were
so
closely
intertwined
that
to
the
lay
companies
of
this
force
were
afterwards
added
two
clerical
companies
one
composed
of
monks
and
friars
the
other
of
secular
priests
about
of
these
ecclesiastics
were
under
arms
even
the
women
were
organized
in
squads
for
the
transport
of
wounded
the
care
of
the
hospitals

of

the
garrison
at
the
moment
of
verdier
s
first
attack
consisted
of
about
men
not
including
the
irregulars
of
the

there
were
seven
battalions
of
the
old
army
belonging
to
the
regiments
of
ultonia
borbon
and
voluntarios
de
barcelona
with
three
battalions
of
miqueletes
two
local
corps
and
of
gerona
and
the
of

there
was
a
single
squadron
newly
levied
the
escuadron
de
san
of
artillery
there
were
but
men
a
wholly
insufficient
number
the
officers
of
that
arm
were
given
more
to
train
partly
miqueletes
of
the
gerona
battalion
partly
sailors
having
some
small
experience
of
gunnery
it
was
difficult
to
make
proper
use
of
the
great
store
of
cannon
in
the
fortress
when
more
than
half
the
troops
allotted
to
them
had
never
before
seen
much
less
served
a
heavy
gun
of
position
to
the
above
men
of
all
arms
must
be
added
about
irregulars
of
the
crusade
seven
lay
and
two
clerical
companies
of
fusiliers
and
two
more
of
artificers
but
these
were
set
to
guard
almost
unapproachable
parts
of
the
wall
or
held
in
reserve
most
of
the
stress
fell
upon
the
organized
troops
the
defence
was
altogether
conducted
on
scientific
principles
and
had
nothing
in
common
with
that
of
saragossa
here
the
irregulars
formed
only
a
small
fraction
of
the
garrison
and
were
never
hurled
in
senseless
fury
against
the
french
batteries
but
used
carefully
and
cautiously
as
an
auxiliary
force
capable
of
setting
free
some
part
of
the
trained
men
for
service
on
the
more
important
points
of
the
enceinte
ultonia
the
regiment
of
ulster
still
contained
many
officers
of
the
old
jacobite
strain
as
may
be
seen
by
consulting
the
list
of
killed
and
wounded
where
such
names
as
o
donnell
macarthy
nash
fitzgerald
pierson
coleby
candy
occur
but
it
had
just
been
raised
from
to
bayonets
by
filling
the
depleted
with
catalan
recruits
and
all
the
junior
lieutenants
newly
appointed
were
catalans
also
so
there
was
little
irish
about
it
save
the
names
of
some
of
its
senior
officers
for
the
details
of
the
composition
of
the

see

no
i
know
not
why
napier
contrasting
gerona
with

ii
says
that
at
the
former
place
the
regular
garrison
was
the
armed
multitude
less
than
when
it
is
remembered
that
its
total
population
was
souls
of
whom
some
fled
to
places
of
safety
before
the
siege
began
and
that
it
had
already
raised
two
battalions
of
miqueletes
with
bayonets
out
of
its
male
inhabitants
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
more
than
armed
irregulars
are
to
be
procured
for
in
a
population
of
souls
there
can
not
be
more
than
some

the

was
about
strong
at

for
the
first
two
months
of
the

alvarez
received
no
help
whatever
from
without
in
may
the
central
government
of
catalonia
had
been
left
in
a
perfectly
paralysed
condition
when
blake
went
off

and
took
with
him
the
best
of
the
regular

in

to
engage
in
the

of

and
maria
coupigny
the
interim
commander
at
tarragona
had
only
organized
men
and
he
and
the
catalan
provincial
junta
were
during
that
month
much
engrossed
with
an
enterprise
which
distracted
them
from
the
needs
of
gerona
a
conspiracy
had
been
formed
within
the
walls
of
barcelona
with
the
object
of
rising
against
the
garrison
in
cyr
s
absence
a
secret
committee
of
priests
merchants
and
retired
officers
had
collected
all
the
arms
in
the
city
smuggled
in
many
muskets
from
without
and
enlisted
several
thousand
persons
in
a
grand
design
for
an
outbreak
and
a
sort
of
sicilian
vespers
fixed
after
two
postponements
for
the
of
may
they
opened
communication
with
coupigny
and
with
the
captains
of
the
british
frigates
blockading
the
port
the
one
was
to
bring
his
troops
to
the
gates
the
others
to
deliver
an
attack
on
the
port
upon
the
appointed
night
no
spaniard
betrayed
the
plot
though
citizens
are
said
to
have
been
in
the
secret
but
it
was
frustrated
by
two
foreigners
conscious
that
the
town
could
not
be
freed
if
the
citadel
of
monjuich
was
retained
by
the
french
the
conspirators
sounded
two
italian
officers
named
captain
dottori
fort
adjutant
of
monjuich
and
captain
provana
who
was
known
to
be
discontented
and
thought
to
be
corruptible
they
offered
them
an
immense
bribe

it
is
said
to
betray
the
postern
of
monjuich
to
the
troops
of
coupigny
who
were
to
be
ready
in
the
ditch
at
midnight
but
they
had
mistaken

the
officers
conferred
with
duhesme
and
consented
to
act
as
they
pretended
to
join
the
conspiracy
were
introduced
to
and
had
interviews
with
the
chiefs
and
informed
the
governor
on
the
morning
before
the
appointed
date
many
of
the
leaders
were
arrested
duhesme
placed
guards
in
every
street
and
proclaimed
that
he
knew
all
the
citizens
remained
quiet
in
their
despair
the
chiefs
who
had
not
been
seized
fled

engrossed
in
this
plot
the
official
chiefs
of
catalonia
half
forgot
gerona
and
did
nothing
to
help
alvarez
till
long
after
the
siege
had
begun
the
only
assistance
that
he
received
from
without
was
that
the
miqueletes
and
of
the
ampurdam
and
the
mountain
region
above
hostalrich
were
always
skirmishing
with
verdier
s
outposts
and
once
or
twice
cut
off
his
convoys
of
munitions
on
their
way
from
figueras
to
the
front
the
french
engineers
were
somewhat
at
variance
as
to
the
right
way
to
deal
with
gerona
there
were
two
obvious
alternatives
an
attack
on
the
weak
front
of
the
mercadal
was
certain
to
succeed
the
ground
before
the
walls
was
suitable
for
trenches
and
the
fortifications
were
trifling
but
when
a
lodgement
had
been
made
in
this
quarter
of
the
town
it
would
be
necessary
to
work
forward
among
the
narrow
lanes
and
barricades
to
the
oña
and
then
to
cross
that
river
in
order
to
continue
similar
operations
through
the
streets
of
gerona
even
when
the
city
had
been
subdued
the
garrison
might
still
hold
out
in
the
formidable
works
on
the
monjuich
and
capuchin
heights
the
reduction
of
the
mercadal
and
the
city
moreover
would
have
to
be
carried
out
under
a
continuous
plunging
fire
from
the
forts
above
which
overlooked
the
whole
place
this
danger
was
especially
insisted
upon
by
some
of
the
engineer
officers
who
declared
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
troops
to
work
their
way
forward
over
ground
so
exposed
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
proved
after
the
siege
was
over
and
the
forts
had
been
examined
by
the
captors
that
this
fear
had
been
exaggerated
the
angle
of
fire
was
such
that
large
sections
of
the
town
were
in
no
way
commanded
from
the
heights
and
the
streets
could
not
have
been
searched
in
the
fashion
that
was
imagined
but
this
obvious
in
december
could
not
have
been
known
in
may
the
second
alternative
was
to
commence
the
attack
on
gerona
not
from
the
easiest
but
from
the
most
difficult
side
by
battering
the
lofty
fort
of
monjuich
from
the
high
plateau
beside
it
the
defences
here
were
very
formidable
the
ground
was
bare
exposed
rock
but
if
monjuich
were
once
captured
it
was
calculated
that
the
town
must
surrender
as
it
was
completely
overlooked
by
the
fort
and
had
no
further
protection
save
its
antiquated
mediaeval
wall
the
deduction
that
it
would
be
cheaper
in
the
end
to
begin
with
the
difficult
task
of
taking
monjuich
rather
than
the
easier
operations
against
the
mercadal
seemed
plausible
its
fault
was
that
it
presupposed
that
alvarez
and
his
garrison
would
behave
according
to
the
accepted
rules
of
siegecraft
and
yield
when
their
situation
became
hopeless
but
in
dealing
with
spanish
garrisons
the
rules
of
military
logic
did
not
always
act
alvarez
essayed
the
impossible
and
held
out
behind
his
defective
defences
for
four
months
after
monjuich
fell
the
loss
of
men
and
time
that
he
thereby
inflicted
on
the
french
was
certainly
no
less
than
that
which
would
have
been
suffered
if
the
besiegers
had
begun
with
the
mercadal
and
worked
upwards
by
incessant
street
fighting
towards
the
forts
on
the
height
but
it
is
hard
to
say
that
verdier
erred
he
did
not
know
his
adversary
and
he
did
know
from
his
experiences
at
saragossa
what
street
fighting
meant
see
belmas
iii
it
may
be
added
that
verdier
s
views
were
accepted
by
the
sanson
who
had
been
specially
sent
from
france
by
the
emperor
to
give
his
opinion
on
the
best
mode
of
procedure
the
document
which
verdier
sanson
and
taviel
the
commanding
artillery
officer
of
the
corps
sent
to
paris
to
justify
their
choice
of
the
upper
point
of
attack
lays
stress
mainly
on
the
impossibility
of
advancing
from
the
mercadal
under
the
fire
of
the
upper
forts
but
there
were
other
reasons
for
selecting
monjuich
as
the
point
of
attack
it
lay
far
nearer
to
the
road
to
france
and
the
central
beside
sarria
and
the
pont
mayor
the
approaches
would
be
over
highly
defensible
ground
where
if
a
disaster
occurred
the
defeated
assailant
could
easily
recover
himself
and
oppose
a
strong
front
to
the
enemy
the
shortness
of
the
front
was
suitable
for
an
army
of
the
moderate
strength
of
men
which
had
to
deal
with
a
fortress
whose
perimeter
allowing
for
outlying
forts
and
inaccessible
precipices
was
some
six
miles
moreover
the
ground
in
front
of
the
mercadal
had
the
serious
inconvenience
of
being
liable
to
inundation
summer
spates
on
the
ter
and
oña
are
rare
but
occur
from
time
to
time
and
there
was
the
bare
chance
that
when
the
trenches
had
been
opened
all
might
be
swept
away
by
the
rivers

and
eighteenth
lecchi
s
italians
had
closed
the
western
exits
by
occupying
the
plain
of
salt
on
the
the
inner
posts
of
observation
of
the
spaniards
had
been
cleared
off
when
on
may
the
italians
seized
the
suburban
village
of
santa
eugenia
and
on
june
the
germans
took
possession
of
the
mountain
of
nuestra
señora
de
los
angeles
but
it
was
only
on
june
that
the
besiegers
broke
ground
and
commenced
their
trenches
and
batteries
on
the
plateau
of
monjuich
it
was
necessary
to
make
a
beginning
by
subduing
the
outer
defences
of
the
fort
the
towers
or
redoubts
of
san
luis
san
narciso
and
san
daniel
two
batteries
of
were
constructed
against
them
while
a
third
battery
of
mortars
on
the
green
mound
by
the
casa
den
roca
on
the
west
bank
of
the
ter
was
to
play
upon
the
north
end
of
the
town
verdier
hoped
that
the
bombardment
would
break
the
spirit
of
the
citizens
little
knowing
the
obstinate
people
with
whom
he
had
to
deal
five
thousand
bombs
thrown
into
the
place
in
june
and
july
produced
no
effect
whatever
more
batteries
on
the
heights
were
thrown
up
upon
the
and
of
june
while
on
the
former
day
to
distract
the
attention
of
the
spaniards
lecchi
s
division
in
the
plain
below
was
ordered
to
open
a
false
attack
upon
the
mercadal
this
had
good
effect
as
a
diversion
since
alvarez
had
expected
an
assault
in
this
quarter
and
the
long
line
of
trenches
thrown
up
by
the
italians
in
front
of
santa
eugenia
attracted
much
of
his
attention
three
days
of
battering
greatly
damaged
san
luis
and
san
narciso
which
were
no
more
than
round
towers
of
masonry
with
ditches
cut
in
the
rock
and
only
two
or
three
guns
apiece
the
french
also
took
possession
on
the
night
of
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
of
the
remains
of
the
suburb
of
pedret
between
monjuich
and
the
ter
as
if
about
to
establish
themselves
in
a
position
from
which
they
could
attack
the
north
gate
of
the
town
and
the
bastion
of
santa
maria
hitherto
the
defence
had
seemed
a
little
passive
but
at
dawn
on
the
morning
of
the
seventeenth
alvarez
delivered
the
first
of
the
many
furious
sallies
which
he
made
against
the
siege
lines
a
battalion
of
ultonia
rushed
suddenly
out
of
monjuich
and
drove
the
french
who
were
taken
completely
by
surprise
out
of
the
ruins
of
pedret
aided
by
a
smaller
detachment
including
the
artificers
of
the
who
came
out
of
the
santa
maria
gate
they
destroyed
all
the
works
and
lodgements
of
the
besiegers
in
the
suburb
and
held
it
till
they
were
driven
out
by
two
french
and
one
westphalian
battalion
sent
up
from
verdier
s
reserves
the
spaniards
were
forced
back
into
the
town
but
retired
in
good
order
contented
to
have
undone
three
days
of
the
besiegers
labour
they
had
lost
men
the
french
in
this
sharp
skirmish
two
days
later
the
towers
of
san
luis
and
san
narciso
which
had
been
reduced
to
shapeless
heaps
of
stone
were
carried
by
assault
with
a
loss
to
the
french
of
only
men
but
an
attempt
to
carry
san
daniel
by
the
same
rush
was
beaten
off
this
redoubt
being
still
in
a
tenable
state
its
gorge
however
was
completely
commanded
from
the
ruins
of
san
luis
and
access
to
or
exit
from
it
was
rendered
so
dangerous
that
alvarez
withdrew
its
garrison
on
the
next
night
the
possession
of
these
three
outworks
brought
the
french
close
up
to
monjuich
which
they
could
now
attack
from
ground
which
was
favourable
in
every
respect
save
that
it
was
bare
rock
lacking
soil
it
was
impossible
to
excavate
in
it
and
all
advances
had
to
be
made
by
building
trenches
if
the
word
is
not
a
misnomer
in
this
case
of
sandbags
and
loose
stones
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
the
men
working
at
the
end
of
the
sap
were
therefore
completely
exposed
and
the
work
could
only
proceed
at
a
great
expense
of
life
nevertheless
the
preparations
advanced
rapidly
and
on
the
night
of
july
an
enormous
battery
of
sandbags
called
the
was
thrown
up
at
a
distance
of
only
four
hundred
yards
from
monjuich
next
morning
it
opened
on
the
fort
with
twenty
and
and
soon
established
a
superiority
over
the
fire
of
the
defence
several
spanish
pieces
were
dismounted
others
had
to
be
removed
because
it
was
too
deadly
to
serve
them
but
a
steady
fire
was
returned
against
the
besiegers
from
the
constable
and
calvary
forts
on
the
other
side
of
the
galligan
ravine
nevertheless
monjuich
began
to
crumble
and
it
looked
as
if
the
end
of
the
siege
were
already
approaching
on
july
there
was
a
breach
feet
broad
in
the
fort
s
bastion
and
the
spanish
flag
which
floated
over
it
was
thrown
down
into
the
ditch
by
a
chance
shot
a
young
officer
named
montorro
climbed
down
brought
it
up
and
nailed
it
to
a
new
flagstaff
under
the
fire
of
twenty
guns
meanwhile
long
stretches
of
the
parapet
of
monjuich
were
ruined
the
ditch
was
with
débris
and
the
garrison
could
only
protect
themselves
by
hasty
erections
of
gabions
and
sandbags
placed
where
the
crest
of
the
masonry
had
stood
by
this
time
cyr
and
the
covering
army
had
abandoned
the
position
in
the
plain
of
vich
which
they
had
so
long
occupied
the
general
had
as
it
seems
convinced
himself
at
last
that
blake
who
was
still
engaged
in
his
unlucky
aragonese
campaign
was
not
likely
to
appear
he
therefore
moved
nearer
to
gerona
in
order
to
repress
the
efforts
of
the
local
who
were
giving
much
trouble
to
verdier
s
communications
on
june
he
established
his
head
quarters
at
caldas
de
malavella
some
nine
miles
to
the
of
gerona
that
same
evening
one
of
his
italian
brigades
intercepted
and
captured
a
convoy
of
oxen
which
the
governor
of
hostalrich
was
trying
to
introduce
into
the
beleaguered
city
along
one
of
the
which
lead
to
the
capuchin
heights
from
the
coast
cyr
strung
out
his
men
in
a
line
from
san
feliu
de
guixols
on
the
sea
to
the
upper
ter
in
a
semicircle
which
covered
all
the
approaches
to
gerona
saving
those
from
the
ampurdam
he
visited
verdier
s
camp
inspected
the
siege
operations
and
expressed
his
opinion
that
an
attack
on
the
mercadal
front
would
have
been
preferable
to
that
which
had
been
actually
chosen
but
he
washed
his
hands
of
all
responsibility
told
verdier
that
since
he
had
chosen
to
correspond
directly
with
paris
he
must
take
all
the
praise
or
blame
resulting
from
his
choice
and
refused
to
countermand
or
to
alter
any
of
his
subordinate
s
dispositions
on
july
however
he
sent
with
some
lack
of
logic
a
summons
of
his
own
to
alvarez
inviting
him
to
surrender
on
account
of
the
desperate
state
of
his
defences
this
he
did
without
informing
verdier
of
his
move
the
governor
returned
an
indignant
negative
and
verdier
wrote
in
great
wrath
to
complain
that
if
the
siege
was
his
affair
as
he
had
just
been
told
it
was
monstrous
that
his
commander
should
correspond
with
the
garrison
without
his
knowledge
the
two
generals
were
left
on
even
worse
terms
than
before
cyr
however
gave
real
assistance
to
the
siege
operations
at
this
time
by
storming
on
july
the
little
fortified
of
palamos
which
lies
on
the
point
of
the
nearest
to
gerona
and
had
been
hitherto
used
by
the
miqueletes
as
a
base
from
which
they
communicated
by
night
with
the
fortress
and
at
the
same
time
kept
in
touch
with
tarragona
and
the
english
ships
of
the
blockading
squadron
see
cyr
to
alvarez
and
verdier
to
the
minister
of
war
at
paris
nos
and
of
belmas
s
appendices
in
his
second
volume
pp
and
on
the
night
of
the
and
of
july
the
defences
of
monjuich
appeared
in
such
a
ruinous
condition
that
commandant
fleury
the
engineer
officer
in
charge
of
the
advanced
parallel
took
the
extraordinary
and
unjustifiable
step
of
assaulting
them
at
with
the
troops
two
companies
only
which
lay
under
his
orders
trusting
that
the
whole
of
the
guards
of
the
trenches
would
follow
if
he
made
a
lodgement
this
presumptuous
attack
made
contrary
to
all
the
rules
of
military
subordination
was
beaten
off
with
a
loss
of
forty
men
its
failure
made
verdier
determine
to
give
the
fort
three
days
more
of
continuous
bombardment
before
attempting
to
storm
it
the
old
batteries
continued
their
fire
a
new
one
was
added
to
enfilade
the
bastion
and
cover
was
contrived
at
several
points
to
shelter
the
troops
which
were
to
deliver
the
assault
till
the
actual
moment
of
the
storm
arrived
but
three
hundred
yards
of
exposed
ground
still
separated
the
front
trenches
from
the
breach
a
distance
far
too
great
according
to
the
rules
of
siegecraft
the
spaniards
meanwhile
finding
it
impossible
under
such
a
fire
to
block
the
breach
which
was
now
broad
enough
for
fifty
men
abreast
threw
up
two
walls
of
gabions
on
each
side
of
it
sank
a
ditch
filled
with
in
front
of
it
and
loopholed
some
interior
buildings
of
the
fort
which
bore
upon
its
reverse
side
napier
says
ii
that
the
breaching
fire
ceased
for
four
days
before
the
assault
and
that
this
caused
the
failure
the
statement
is
in
direct
contradiction
of
vacani
iii
who
states
that
verdier
on
the
contrary
proseguì
per
tre
giorni
il
vivo
fuoco
della
sua
artilleria
and
of
belmas
ii
who
makes
the
same
statement
see
alvarez
s
letter
in
belmas
s
appendix
no
where
he
says
that
the
breach
had
this
breadth
since
july
monjuich
however
looked
in
a
miserable
state
when
just
before
sunrise
on
july
verdier
launched
his
columns
of
assault
upon
it
he
had
collected
for
the
purpose
the
grenadier
and
companies
of
each
of
the
twenty
french
german
and
italian
battalions
of
the
besieging
army
about
men
in
all
they
were
divided
into
two
columns
the
larger
of
which
went
straight
at
the
breach
while
the
smaller
which
was
furnished
with
ladders
was
directed
to
escalade
the
left
face
of
the
which
covers
the
northern
front
of
monjuich
the
troops
passed
with
no
great
loss
over
the
open
space
which
divided
them
from
the
work
as
its
guns
had
all
been
silenced
and
the
fire
from
the
more
distant
forts
was
ineffective
in
the
dusk
but
when
they
got
within
close
musketry
range
they
began
to
fall
fast
the
head
of
the
main
column
which
was
composed
of
some
sapper
companies
and
the
italian
velites
of
the
guard
got
up
on
to
the
face
of
the
breach
but
could
never
break
in
every
officer
or
man
who
reached
the
cutting
and
its
was
shot
down
the
concentric
fire
of
the
defenders
so
swept
the
opening
that
nothing
could
live
there
meanwhile
the
rear
of
the
column
was
brought
to
a
stand
partly
in
partly
outside
the
ditch
the
spaniards
kept
playing
upon
it
with
musketry
and
two
or
three
small
and
which
had
been
kept
under
cover
and
reserved
for
that
purpose
firing
canister
into
it
at
a
distance
of
twenty
or
thirty
yards
flesh
and
blood
could
not
bear
this
for
long
and
the
whole
mass
broke
and
went
to
the
rear
verdier
who
had
come
out
to
the
to
view
the
assault
had
the
men
rallied
and
sent
forward
a
second
time
the
head
of
the
column
again
reached
the
breach
and
again
withered
away
the
supporting
mass
gave
way
at
once
and
fell
back
much
more
rapidly
than
on
the
first
assault
yet
the
general
most
unwisely
insisted
on
a
third
attack
which
made
feebly
and
without
conviction
by
men
who
knew
that
they
were
beaten
only
served
to
increase
the
casualty
list
meanwhile
the
escalade
of
the
by
the
smaller
column
had
been
repelled
with
ease
the
assailants
barely
succeeded
in
crossing
the
ditch
and
planting
a
few
ladders
against
the
scarp
no
one
survived
who
tried
to
mount
them
and
the
troops
drew
off
this
seems
a
low
estimate
of
belmas
as
the
d
formed
a
third
of
each
battalion
this
bloody
repulse
cost
the
french
casualties
including
officers
killed
or
wounded
much
more
than
a
third
of
the
troops
engaged
it
is
clear
therefore
that
it
was
not
courage
which
had
been
lacking
nor
could
it
be
said
that
the
enemy
s
artillery
fire
had
not
been
subdued
nor
that
the
breach
was
insufficient
nor
that
the
yards
of
open
ground
crossed
by
the
column
had
been
a
fatal
obstacle
indeed
they
had
been
passed
with
little
loss
the
mistake
of
verdier
had
been
that
he
attacked
before
the
garrison
was
demoralized
the
same
error
made
by
the
english
at
badajoz
in
and
at
san
sebastian
in
a
broad
breach
by
itself
does
not
necessarily
make
a
place
untenable
if
the
spirit
of
the
defenders
is
high
and
if
they
are
prepared
with
all
the
resources
of
the
military
art
for
resisting
the
stormers
as
were
the
geronese
on
july
the
garrison
lost
it
may
be
remarked
only
men
out
of
a
strength
of
present
in
the
fort
that
morning
the
casualty
list
however
was
somewhat
increased
by
the
accidental
explosion
apparently
by
a
careless
gunner
of
the
magazine
of
the
tower
of
san
juan
alongside
of
the
galligan
which
was
destroyed
with
its
little
garrison
of
men
the
repulse
of
the
assault
of
monjuich
thoroughly
demoralized
the
besieging
army
the
resistance
of
the
spaniards
had
been
so
fierce
the
loss
they
had
inflicted
so
heavy
that
verdier
s
motley
collection
of
french
german
lombard
and
neapolitan
regiments
lost
heart
and
confidence
their
low
spirits
were
made
manifest
by
the
simultaneous
outbreak
of
desertion
and
disease
the
two
inevitable
marks
of
a
decaying
morale
all
through
the
second
half
of
july
and
august
the
hospitals
grew
gradually
fuller
not
only
from
sunstroke
cases
which
were
frequent
on
the
bare
hot
rocky
ground
of
the
heights
but
from
dysentery
and
malaria
the
banks
of
the
ter
always
possessed
a
reputation
for
epidemics
twice
in
earlier
centuries
a
french
army
had
perished
before
the
walls
of
gerona
by
plagues
which
the
citizens
piously
attributed
to
their
patron
san
narciso
it
was
mainly
because
he
realized
the
depression
of
his
troops
that
verdier
refrained
from
any
more
assaults
and
went
on
from
july
to
august
battering
monjuich
incessantly
while
he
cautiously
pushed
forward
his
trenches
till
they
actually
reached
the
ditch
of
the
which
covers
the
northern
front
of
the
fort
the
garrison
was
absolutely
overwhelmed
by
the
incessant
bombardment
which
destroyed
every
piece
of
upstanding
masonry
and
prevented
them
from
rebuilding
anything
that
was
demolished
they
were
forced
to
lurk
in
the
casemates
and
to
burrow
for
shelter
in
the
débris
which
filled
the
interior
of
the
work
three
large
breaches
had
been
made
at
various
points
yet
verdier
would
never
risk
another
assault
till
on
august
his
approaches
actually
crowned
the
lip
of
the
ditch
of
the
and
his
sappers
had
blown
in
its
counterscarp
the
ruined
little
outwork
was
then
stormed
with
a
loss
of
only
forty
men
this
put
the
french
in
the
possession
of
good
cover
only
a
few
yards
from
the
main
body
of
the
fort
proceeding
with
the
same
caution
as
before
they
made
their
advances
against
monjuich
by
mining
on
the
night
of
the
august
no
less
than
mines
under
the
glacis
of
the
fort
were
exploded
simultaneously
this
left
a
gaping
void
in
front
of
the
original
breach
of
july
and
filled
up
the
ditch
with
débris
for
many
yards
on
either
side
part
of
the
interior
of
the
fort
was
clearly
visible
from
the
besiegers
trenches
only
one
resource
for
saving
monjuich
remained
to
alvarez
a
sortie
for
the
expulsion
of
the
enemy
from
their
advanced
works
it
was
executed
with
great
courage
at
midday
on
august
while
at
the
same
time
separate
demonstrations
to
distract
the
enemy
were
made
at
two
other
points
the
column
from
monjuich
had
considerable
success
it
stormed
two
advanced
batteries
spiked
their
guns
and
set
fire
to
their
gabions
the
french
were
cleared
out
of
many
of
their
trenches
but
made
head
behind
one
of
the
rear
batteries
where
they
were
joined
by
their
reserves
who
finally
thrust
back
the
sallying
force
into
the
fort
the
damage
done
though
considerable
could
be
repaired
in
a
day
verdier
gave
orders
for
the
storm
of
the
dilapidated
fort
on
the
night
of
august
and
borrowed
a
regiment
from
cyr
s
covering
army
to
lead
the
assault
being
still
very
doubtful
of
the
temper
of
his
own
troops
but
at
six
on
the
preceding
afternoon
an
explosion
was
heard
in
monjuich
and
great
part
of
its
battered
walls
flew
up
into
the
air
the
spaniards
had
quietly
evacuated
it
a
few
minutes
before
after
preparing
mines
for
its
demolition
the
french
when
they
entered
found
nothing
but
a
shapeless
mass
of
stones
and
eighteen
disabled
cannon
the
garrison
had
lost
in
the
days
of
its
defence
men
killed
and
wounded
the
besiegers
had
first
and
last
suffered
something
like
three
times
this
loss
while
the
bombardment
of
monjuich
was
going
on
the
spanish
generals
outside
the
fortress
had
at
last
begun
to
make
serious
efforts
for
its
assistance
not
only
had
the
redoubled
their
activity
against
verdier
s
convoys
and
several
times
succeeded
in
destroying
them
or
turning
them
back
but
coupigny
had
at
last
begun
to
move
for
he
saw
that
since
blake
s
rout
at
belchite
on
june
he
and
he
alone
possessed
an
organized
body
of
troops
on
this
side
of
spain
small
though
it
was
unable
to
face
cyr
in
the
field
he
tried
at
least
to
throw
succours
into
gerona
by
the
mountain
paths
from
the
south
if
he
could
do
no
more
the
first
attempt
was
disastrous
three
battalions
started
from
hostalrich
under
an
english
adventurer
ralph
marshall
whom
alvarez
had
suggested
for
the
command
of
this
expedition
they
evaded
the
first
line
of
the
covering
army
but
at
castellar
on
july
ran
into
the
very
centre
of
pino
s
division
which
had
concentrated
from
all
sides
for
their
destruction
marshall
escaped
into
gerona
with
no
more
than
twelve
men
officers
and
rank
and
file
laid
down
their
arms
the
rest
of
the
column
some
or
men
evaded
surrender
by
dispersion
cyr
vacani
and
belmas
all
say
that
marshall
escaped
by
hoisting
the
white
flag
and
taking
to
the
hills
while
terms
of
capitulation
were
being
arranged
coupigny
on
the
other
hand
see
his
letter
in
belmas
s
appendix
no
says
that
marshall
behaved
admirably
but
was
not
seconded
by
his
men
who
flinched
and
abandoned
him
rich
the
officer
who
failed
to
guide
the
column
aright
was
not
as
napier
supposed
ii
an
englishman
but
a
catalan
as
is
shown
by
his
christian
name
narciso
ric
or
rich
is
a
common
name
in
catalonia
equally
disastrous
though
on
a
smaller
scale
was
another
attempt
made
on
august
by
a
party
of
miqueletes
to
enter
gerona
they
eluded
cyr
but
on
arriving
at
the
entry
of
the
galligan
close
under
the
forts
made
the
unfortunate
mistake
of
entering
the
convent
of
san
daniel
which
the
garrison
had
been
compelled
to
evacuate
a
few
days
before
it
was
now
in
the
french
lines
and
the
catalans
were
all
taken
prisoners
it
was
not
till
august
six
days
after
the
fall
of
monjuich
that
alvarez
obtained
his
first
feeble
reinforcement
the
miquelete
battalion
of
cervera
with
a
draft
for
that
of
vich
already
in
the
garrison
altogether
bayonets
got
into
the
city
on
the
west
side
by
eluding
lecchi
s
italians
in
the
plain
and
fording
the
ter
they
were
much
needed
for
alvarez
was
complaining
to
the
catalan
junta
that
he
had
now
only
men
left
of
his
original
this
must
have
been
an
exaggeration
as
men
under
arms
of
the
old
garrison
survived
to
surrender
in
december
see
alvarez
s
letter
on
of
belmas
s
appendix
verdier
had
written
to
his
master
after
the
capture
of
monjuich
to
announce
that
gerona
must
infallibly
surrender
within
eight
or
ten
days
now
that
it
had
nothing
but
an
antiquated
mediaeval
wall
to
oppose
to
his
cannon
so
far
however
was
he
from
being
a
true
prophet
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
second
and
longer
episode
of
the
siege
which
was
to
be
protracted
far
into
the
winter
had
only
just
begun

the
fall
of
gerona
when
monjuich
had
been
evacuated
the
position
of
gerona
was
undoubtedly
perilous
of
the
two
mountain
summits
which
command
the
city
one
was
now
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
french
for
not
only
the
great
fort
itself
but
several
of
the
smaller
works
above
the
ravine
of
the
galligan
such
as
the
fortified
convent
of
san
daniel
and
the
ruined
tower
of
san
juan
had
been
lost
the
front
exposed
to
attack
now
consisted
of
the
northern
section
of
the
old
city
wall
from
the
bastion
of
santa
maria
at
the
water
s
edge
to
the
tower
of
la
gironella
which
forms
the
angle
of
the
place
and
lies
further
up
the
slope
of
the
capuchin
heights
than
any
other
portion
of
the
enceinte
the
space
between
these
two
points
was
simply
covered
by
a
mediaeval
wall
set
with
small
round
towers
neither
the
towers
nor
the
curtain
between
them
had
been
built
to
hold
artillery
indeed
the
only
spots
on
this
front
where
guns
had
been
placed
were
the
comparatively
modern
bastion
of
santa
maria
a
work
erected
under
and
about
the
gironella
and
called
the
redoubt
of
the
germans
and
two
parts
of
the
wall
called
the
platforms
of
san
pedro
and
san
cristobal
which
had
been
widened
till
they
could
carry
a
few
heavy
guns
on
the
rest
of
the
enceinte
owing
to
its
narrowness
nothing
but
and
could
be
mounted
the
parts
of
the
curtain
most
exposed
to
attack
were
the
sections
named
santa
lucia
san
pedro
san
cristobal
and
las
sarracinas
from
churches
or
quarters
which
lay
close
behind
them
with
nothing
but
an
antiquated
wall
seven
to
nine
feet
thick
thirty
feet
high
and
destitute
of
a
ditch
it
seemed
that
this
side
of
gerona
was
doomed
to
destruction
within
a
few
days
some
call
them
bastions
but
they
are
too
small
to
deserve
that
name
but
there
were
points
in
the
position
which
rendered
the
attack
more
difficult
than
might
have
been
expected
the
first
was
that
any
approaches
directed
against
this
front
would
be
exposed
to
a
flanking
fire
from
the
forts
on
the
capuchin
heights
especially
from
the
calvary
and
chapter
redoubts
the
second
was
that
the
greater
part
of
the
weak
sections
of
the
wall
were
within
a
angle
for
the
tower
of
santa
lucia
and
the
redoubt
of
the
germans
by
the
gironella
project
and
the
curtains
between
them
are
in
a
receding
sweep
of
the
enceinte
attacks
on
these
sections
would
be
outflanked
and
enfiladed
by
the
two
stronger
works
the
only
exposed
part
of
the
curtain
was
that
called
santa
lucia
running
from
the
tower
of
that
name
down
to
the
bastion
of
santa
maria
lastly
the
parallels
which
the
french
might
construct
from
their
base
on
monjuich
would
have
to
be
built
on
a
down
slope
overlooked
by
loftier
ground
and
when
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
walls
they
would
be
in
a
sort
of
gulley
or
bottom
into
which
the
defenders
of
the
city
could
look
down
from
above
the
only
point
from
which
the
north
end
of
gerona
could
be
approached
from
flat
ground
and
without
disadvantages
of
slope
is
the
short
front
of
less
than
yards
breadth
between
the
foot
of
monjuich
and
the
bank
of
the
ter
here
in
the
ruins
of
the
suburb
of
pedret
there
was
plenty
of
cover
a
soil
easy
to
work
and
a
level
terrain
as
far
as
the
foot
of
the
santa
maria
bastion
the
engineers
of
the
besieging
army
selected
three
sections
of
wall
as
their
objective
the
first
was
the
redoubt
of
the
germans
and
the
tower
of
la
gironella
the
highest
and
most
commanding
works
in
this
part
of
the
enceinte
once
established
in
these
they
could
overlook
and
dominate
the
whole
city
the
other
points
of
attack
were
chosen
for
the
opposite
reason
because
they
were
intrinsically
weak
in
themselves
not
because
they
were
important
or
dominating
parts
of
the
defences
the
curtain
of
santa
lucia
in
particular
seemed
to
invite
attack
as
being
in
a
salient
angle
unprotected
by
flanking
fire
and
destitute
of
any
artillery
of
its
own
verdier
therefore
on
the
advice
of
his
engineers
set
to
work
to
attack
these
points
of
the
enceinte
between
la
gironella
and
santa
maria
new
batteries
erected
amid
the
ruins
of
monjuich
were
levelled
against
them
in
addition
to
such
of
the
older
batteries
as
could
still
be
utilized
on
the
front
by
pedret
also
where
nothing
had
hitherto
been
done
works
were
prepared
for
guns
to
be
directed
against
santa
maria
and
santa
lucia
meanwhile
a
perpetual
bombardment
with
shell
was
kept
up
against
the
whole
quarter
of
the
town
that
lay
behind
the
selected
points
of
attack
mortars
were
always
playing
not
only
from
the
monjuich
heights
but
from
two
batteries
erected
on
the
green
mound
in
the
plain
beyond
the
river
ter
their
effect
was
terrible
almost
every
house
in
the
northern
quarter
of
gerona
was
unroofed
or
destroyed
the
population
had
to
take
refuge
in
cellars
where
after
a
few
days
they
began
to
die
fast
all
the
more
so
that
food
was
just
beginning
to
run
short
as
august
advanced
from
the
to
the
of
that
month
verdier
s
attack
was
developing
itself
by
its
last
day
four
breaches
had
been
established
one
about
forty
feet
broad
in
the
curtain
of
lucia
two
close
together
in
the
works
at
la
gironella
the
fourth
and
smallest
in
the
platform
of
san
cristobal
but
the
approaches
were
still
far
from
the
foot
of
the
wall
the
fire
of
the
outlying
spanish
works
especially
the
calvary
fort
was
unsubdued
and
though
the
guns
along
the
attacked
front
had
all
been
silenced
the
french
artillery
had
paid
dearly
both
in
lives
and
in
material
for
the
advantage
they
had
gained
moreover
sickness
was
making
dreadful
ravages
in
the
ranks
of
the
besieging
army
the
malarious
pestilence
on
which
the
spaniards
had
relied
had
appeared
after
a
sudden
and
heavy
rainfall
had
raised
the
ter
and
oña
beyond
their
banks
and
inundated
the
whole
plain
of
salt
by
malaria
dysentery
and
sunstroke
verdier
had
lost
men
in
addition
to
his
casualties
in
the
siege
many
of
them
were
convalescents
in
the
hospitals
of
perpignan
and
figueras
but
it
was
hard
to
get
them
back
to
the
front
the
made
the
roads
impassable
for
small
detachments
and
the
officers
on
the
line
of
communication
being
very
short
of
men
were
given
to
detaining
drafts
that
reached
them
on
their
way
to
gerona
hence
verdier
including
his
artillerymen
and
sappers
had
less
than
men
left
for
the
siege
and
these
much
discouraged
by
its
interminable
length
short
of
officers
and
sickly
this
was
not
enough
to
guard
a
periphery
of
six
miles
and
messengers
were
continually
slipping
in
or
out
of
gerona
between
the
widely
scattered
camps
of
the
french
belmas
for
convenience
sake
distinguishes
these
two
breaches
by
calling
the
northern
one
the
breach
in
the
barracks
the
southern
the
breach
in
the
latrines
of
the
german
between
gerona
and
perpignan
for
the
defence
of
communications
and
the
garrisoning
of
figueras
there
were
at
this
time
the
valais
battalion
one
battalion
of
the
confederation
of
the
rhine
one
battalion
each
of
the

not
more

returns
of

for
on
august
a
new
phase
of
the
siege
began
in
response
to
the
constant
appeals
of
alvarez
to
the
catalan
junta
and
the
consequent
complaints
of
the
junta
alike
to
the
blake
and
to
the
central
government
at
seville
something
was
at
last
about
to
be
done
to
relieve
gerona
the
supreme
central
junta
in
reply
to
a
formal
representation
of
the
catalans
dated
august
had
sent
blake
reals
in
cash
and
a
peremptory
order
to
march
on
gerona
whatever
the
state
of
his
army
might
be
authorizing
him
to
call
out
all
the
of

aid
the
general

had
at

returned
to

obeyed
though
entirely
lacking
confidence
in
his
means
of
success

blake
s
army
it
will
be
remembered
had
been
completely
routed
at
belchite
by
suchet
on
june
the
wrecks
of
his
aragonese
division
had
gradually
rallied
at
tortosa
those
of
his
valencian
divisions
at
morella
but
even
by
the
end
of
july
he
had
only
a
few
thousand
men
collected
and
he
had
lost
every
gun
of
his
artillery
for
many
weeks
he
could
do
nothing
but
press
the
junta
of
valencia
to
fill
the
depleted
ranks
of
his
regiments
with
recruits
to
reconstitute
his
train
and
to
provide
him
with
new
cannon
aragon
had
been
lost
nothing
could
be
drawn
from
thence
catalonia
distracted
by
suchet
s
demonstration
on
its
western
flank
did
not
do
as
much
as
might
have
been
expected
in
its
own
defence
the
junta
was
inclined
to
favour
the
employment
of
miqueletes
and
and
to
undervalue
the
troops
of
the
line
it
forgot
that
the
irregulars
though
they
did
admirable
work
in
harassing
the
enemy
could
not
be
relied
upon
to
operate
in
large
masses
or
strike
a
decisive
blow
still
the
regiments
at
tarragona
lerida
and
elsewhere
had
been
somewhat
recruited
before
august
was
out
blake
s
field
army
was
composed
of
some
men
there
were
five
valencian
regiments
those
which
had
been
least
mishandled
in
the
campaign
of
aragon
with
the
relics
of
six
of
the
battalions
which
reding
had
brought
from
granada
in
two
of
lazan
s
old
aragonese
corps
and
five
or
six
of
the
regiments
which
had
formed
the
original
garrison
of
catalonia
the
battalions
were
very
weak
it
took
of
them
to
make
up
infantry
of
cavalry
there
were
only
four
squadrons
of
artillery
only
two
batteries
those
of
the
rank
and
file
who
were
not
raw
recruits
were
the
vanquished
of
molins
de
rey
and
valls
or
of
maria
and
belchite
they
had
no
great
confidence
in
blake
and
he
had
still
less
in
them
despite
the
orders
received
from
seville
which
bade
him
risk
all
for
the
relief
of
gerona
he
was
determined
not
to
fight
another
pitched
battle
the
memories
of
belchite
were
too
recent
to
be
forgotten
though
much
obloquy
has
been
poured
upon
his
head
for
this
resolve
he
was
probably
wise
in
his
decision
cyr
had
still
some
men
in
his
covering
army
who
had
taken
no
share
in
the
siege
their
morale
was
intact
and
they
had
felt
little
fatigue
or
privation
they
could
be
and
were
in
fact
reinforced
by
men
from
verdier
s
force
when
the
stress
came
blake
therefore
was
so
far
as
regular
troops
went
outnumbered
by
the
french
especially
in
cavalry
and
artillery
he
could
not
trust
in
time
of
battle
the
miqueletes
of
whom
some
or
from
the
ampurdam
and
central
catalonia
came
to
join
him
he
thought
that
it
might
be
possible
to
elude
or
outflank
cyr
to
lure
him
to
divide
his
forces
into
scattered
bodies
by
threatening
many
points
at
once
or
on
the
other

induce
him
to
concentrate
on

short
front
and
so
to
leave
some
of
the
exits
of

open
but
a
battle
with
the
united
french
army
he
would
not
risk
under
any
conditions
see
the

the

were

from

there
were

otherwise
called
iliberia
and
two
battalions
of
provincial
grenadiers
something
over
men
the
rest
were
mainly
catalans
cyr
however
was
too
wary
for
his
opponent
he
wanted
to
fight
at
all
costs
and
he
was
prepared
to
risk
a
disturbance
of
the
siege
operations
if
he
could
catch
blake
in
the
open
and
bring
him
to
action
the
moment
that
pressure
on
his
outposts
by
regular
troops
coming
from
the
south
was
reported
he
drew
together
souham
s
and
pino
s
divisions
on
the
short
line
between
san
dalmay
on
the
right
and
casa
de
selva
on
the
left
across
the
high

from

at
the
same
time
he
sent
stringent
orders
to
verdier
to
abandon
the
unimportant
sections
of
his
line
of
investment
and
to
come
to
reinforce
the
field
army
at
the
head
of
his
french
division
which
still
counted
bayonets
verdier
accordingly
marched
to
join
his
chief
leaving
lecchi
s
italians
now
little
more
than
strong
to
watch
the
west
side
of
gerona
and
handing
over
the
charge
of
the
works
on
monjuich
the
new
approaches
and
the
park
at
pont

to
the
westphalians
he
abandoned
all
the
outlying

on
the
heights
even
the
convent
of
san
daniel
the
village
of
campdura
and
the
peak
of
nuestra

only
infantry
and

and

were
left
facing

alvarez
was
too
weak
to
drive
off
even
such

ostentatiously
displayed

awaiting

was
being

out
in

detached
one
of

of

some

this

had
with
it
a
convoy
of
more
than
a
thousand

laden
with
provisions
and
a
herd
of
cattle
it
completely
escaped
the
notice
of
the
french
and
marching
from

at
break
of
day
came
down
into
the
plain
of
salt
at
noon
far
in
the
rear
of

army
garcia

had
the
depleted
italian
division
of

in

of

being
in

this
small

which
vainly
believed
itself
covered
from

by

corps
had
kept
no
to
the
rear
being
wholly
intent
on
watching
the
garrison
it
was
surprised
by
the
spanish
column
cut
into
two
halves
and
routed
garcia
conde
entered
the
mercadal
in
triumph
with
his
convoy
and
cyr
first
learnt
what
had
occurred
when
he
saw
the
broken
remnants
of
the
italians
pouring
into
the
rear
of
his
own
line
at
fornells
that
night
gerona
was
free
of
enemies
on
its
southern
and
eastern
sides
and
alvarez
communicated
freely
with
rovira
s
and
claros
s
irregulars
who
had
forced
in
the
westphalian
division
and
compelled
it
to
concentrate
in
monjuich
and
the
camp
by
the
great
park
near
sarria
the
garrison
reoccupied
the
ruined
convent
of
san
daniel
by
the
galligan
and
placed
a
strong
party
in
the
hermitage
on
the
peak
of
nuestra
señora
de
los
angeles
it
also
destroyed
all
the
advanced
trenches
on
the
slopes
of
monjuich
on
the
next
morning
however
it
began
to
appreciate
the
fact
that
the
siege
had
not
been
raised
cyr
sent
back
verdier
s
division
to
rejoin
the
westphalians
and
with
them
the
wrecks
of
lecchi
s
routed
battalions
he
added
to
the
force
under
verdier
half
pino
s
italian
division
six
fresh
battalions
with
these
reinforcements
the
old
could
be
reoccupied
and
the
spaniards
were
forced
back
from
the
points
outside
the
walls
which
they
had
reoccupied
on
the
night
of
september
by
sending
away
such
a
large
proportion
of
the
men
that
he
had
concentrated
for
battle
on
the
previous
day
cyr
left
himself
only
some
men
for
a
general
action
with
blake
if
the
latter
should
resolve
to
fight
but
the
spanish
general
being
without
garcia
conde
s
division
had
also
no
more
than
men
in
line
not
only
did
he
refuse
to
advance
but
when
cyr
determined
to
fight
at
all
costs
marched
against
him
with
offensive
intentions
he
hastily
retreated
as
far
as
hostalrich
two
marches
to
the
rear
there
he
broke
up
his
army
which
had
exhausted
all
its
provisions
cyr
did
the
same
and
for
the
same
reasons
his
men
had
to
disperse
in
order
to
live
he
says
in
his
memoirs
that
if
blake
had
shown
a
bold
front
against
him
and
forced
him
to
keep
the
covering
army
concentrated
for
two
more
days
the
siege
would
have
had
to
be
raised
for
the
covering
army
had
advanced
against
the
spaniards
on
september
with
only
two
days
rations
it
had
exhausted
its
stores
and
eaten
up
the
on
the
fourth
it
would
have
had
to
retire
or
to
break
up
into
small
fractions
leaving
the
unprotected
cyr
doubted
whether
the
retreat
would
have
ceased
before
figueras
was
reached
but
it
is
more
probable
that
he
would
have
merely
fallen
back
to
join
verdier
and
to
live
for
some
days
on
the
dépôts
of
pont
mayor
and
sarria
he
could
have
offered
battle
again
under
the
walls
of
gerona
with
all
his
forces
united
blake
might
have
got
into
close
touch
with
alvarez
and
have
thrown
what
convoys
he
pleased
into
the
town
but
as
long
as
cyr
and
verdier
with
men
lay
opposite
him
he
could
not
have
risked
any
more
the
situation
in
short
would
have
been
that
which
occurred
in
february
under
the
walls
of
badajoz
when
mortier
faced
mendizabal
and
would
probably
have
ended
in
the
same
fashion
by
the
french
attacking
and
driving
off
the
relieving
army
blake
then
may
be
blamed
somewhat
for
his
excessive
caution
in
giving
way
so
rapidly
before
cyr
s
advance
but
if
we
remember
the
quality
of
his
troops
and
the
inevitable
result
of
a
battle
it
is
hard
to
censure
him
overmuch
meanwhile
garcia
conde
whose
movements
were
most
happy
and
adroit
reinforced
the
garrison
of
gerona
up
to
its
original
strength
of
bayonets
by
making
over
to
alvarez
four
whole
battalions
and
some
picked
companies
from
other
corps
and
prepared
to
leave
the
town
with
the
rest
of
his
division
and
the
vast
drove
of
mules
whose
burden
had
been
discharged
into
the
magazines
if
he
had
dedicated
his
whole
force
to
strengthening
the
garrison
the
additional
troops
would
have
eaten
up
in
a
few
days
all
the
provisions
that
the
convoy
had
brought
in
accordingly
he
started
off
at
two
on
september
with
some
men
by
the
upland
path
that
leads
past
the
hermitage
of
los
angeles
cyr
had
just
placed
pino
s
troops
from
the
covering
army
to
guard
the
heights
to
the
of
gerona
but
garcia
conde
warned
by
the
peasants
of
their
exact
position
slipped
between
the
posts
and
got
off
to
hostalrich
with
a
loss
of
no
more
than
fifty
men
the
reinforcements
left
behind
by
garcia
conde
consisted
of
two
battalions
of
baza
one
of
reding
s
old
granadan
regiments
with
bayonets
two
catalan
tercios
and
of
talarn
with
bayonets
and
select
companies
of
of
granada
iliberia
of
vich
and
voluntarios
de
tarragona
in
all
apparently
about
men
the
table
on
of
arteche
s
vol
vii
seems
to
err
in
crediting
the
cervera
tercio
to
garcia
this
had
come
in
on
as
described
on
on
the
other
hand
the
company
of
voluntarios
de
tarragona
should
be
credited
to
him
cyr
tells
a
story
to
the
effect
that
he
had
placed
mazzuchelli
s
brigade
of
pino
s
division
in
ambush
behind
the
hill
of
palau
to
intercept
garcia
conde
and
that
the
spaniards
would
have
marched
right
into
the
trap
on
if
the
italians
had
not
been
stupid
enough
to
sound
the
at
dawn
and
so
warn
the
enemy
of
their
existence
but
the
spanish
accounts
of
minali
and
claros
are
quite
different
see
arteche
vii
they
are
to
the
effect
that
garcia
conde
had
intended
to
start
on
the
third
but
hearing
firing
on
the
side
of
palau
deferred
his
exit
and
took
another
road
if
he
was
starting
at
or
o
clock
at
night
on
the
third
he
can
not
have
been
warned
by
the
morning
bugles
at
o
clock
on
the
previous
morning
see
cyr
and
napier
ii
for
the
french
story
which
the
latter
takes
over
whole
from
the
former
belmas
and
vacani
do
not
give
the
tale
though
they
have
a
full
narration
of
the
escape
of
garcia
conde
before
he
could
consider
his
position
safe
verdier
had
to
complete
the
lines
of
investment
this
he
did
on
september
by
driving
off
the
intermediate
posts
which
alvarez
had
thrown
out
from
the
capuchin
heights
to
link
the
town
with
the
garrison
in
the
hermitage
of
nuestra
señora
de
los
angeles
mazzuchelli
s
brigade
stormed
the
hermitage
itself
on
the
following
day
with
a
loss
of
about
eighty
men
and
massacred
the
greater
part
of
the
garrison
on
that
same
day
however
the
french
suffered
a
small
disaster
in
another
part
of
the
environs
general
joba
who
had
been
sent
with
three
battalions
to
clear
the
road
to
figueras
from
the
bands
of
claros
and
rovira
was
beaten
and
slain
at
san
gregorio
by
those
chiefs
but
the
miqueletes
afterwards
retired
to
the
mountains
and
the
road
became
intermittently
passable
at
least
for
large
bodies
of
men
it
was
not
till
september
however
that
verdier
recommenced
the
actual
siege
and
bade
his
batteries
open
once
more
upon
gerona
the
eleven
days
of
respite
since
blake
interrupted
the
bombardment
on
september
had
been
invaluable
to
the
garrison
who
had
cleared
away
the
débris
from
the
foot
of
the
breaches
replaced
the
damaged
artillery
on
the
front
of
attack
and
thrown
up
interior
defences
behind
the
shattered
parts
of
the
wall
they
had
also
destroyed
all
the
advanced
trenches
of
the
besiegers
which
had
to
be
reconstructed
at
much
cost
of
life
in
four
days
verdier
had
recovered
most
of
the
lost
ground
when
he
was
surprised
by
a
vigorous
sally
from
the
gate
of
san
pedro
the
garrison
dashing
out
at
three
stormed
the
three
nearest
breaching
batteries
spiked
their
guns
and
filled
in
all
the
trenches
which
were
advancing
towards
the
foot
of
the
walls
four
days
work
was
thus
undone
in
an
hour
and
it
was
only
on
september
that
verdier
had
reconstructed
his
works
and
pushed
forward
so
far
towards
his
objective
that
he
considered
an
assault
possible
he
then
begged
cyr
to
lend
him
a
brigade
of
fresh
troops
pleading
that
the
was
now
so
weak
in
numbers
and
so
demoralized
by
its
losses
that
he
did
not
consider
that
the
men
would
do
themselves
justice
at
a
storm
the
losses
of
officers
had
been
fearful
one
battalion
was
commanded
by
a
lieutenant
another
had
been
reduced
to
fifty
men
desertion
was
rampant
among
several
of
the
foreign
corps
of
infantry
of
the
french
westphalian
and
italian
divisions
less
than
now
remained
so
far
as
mere
siegecraft
went
as
he
explained
to
cyr
the
affair
might
be
considered
at
an
end
we
have
made
four
large
practicable
breaches
each
of
them
sufficient
to
reduce
the
town
but
the
troops
can
not
be
cyr
refused
to
lend
a
man
for
the
assault
writing
with
polite
irony
that
every
general
has
his
own
task
yours
is
to
take
gerona
with
the
resources
placed
at
your
disposal
by
the
government
for
that
object
and
the
officers
named
by
the
government
to
conduct
the
siege
he
added
that
he
considered
from
its
past
conduct
that
the
morale
of
the
was
rather
good
than
bad
he
should
not
therefore
allow
the
covering
army
to
join
the
assault
but
he
would
lend
the
whole
of
pino
s
division
to
take
charge
of
monjuich
and
the
camps
during
the
storm
and
would
make
a
demonstration
against
the
mercadal
to
distract
the
enemy
from
the
breaches
with
this
verdier
had
to
be
content
and
after
making
two
final
protests
concentrated
all
his
brigades
save
those
of
the
westphalian
division
and
composed
with
them
four
columns
amounting
to
some
men
directing
one
against
each
of
the
four
breaches
that
sent
against
the
platform
of
san
cristobal
was
a
mere
demonstration
of
men
but
the
other
three
were
heavy
masses
the
italians
went
against
santa
lucia
the
french
brigade
against
the
southern
breach
in
the
redoubt
of
the
germans
the
berg
troops
against
the
northern
one
a
separate
demonstration
was
made
against
the
calvary
fort
whose
unsubdued
fire
still
flanked
the
breaches
in
the
hope
that
its
defenders
might
be
prevented
from
interfering
in
the
main
struggle
verdier
did
not
exaggerate
see

that

in

had
fair
warning
of
what
was
coming
and
had
done
his
best
to
provide
against
the
danger
the
less

of
the
enceinte
had
been
put
in
charge

o

in

descended
from

into

the
diversion
against
the
calvary
fort
was
made
at
the

moment
and
beaten
off
in
a
few
minutes
so
that
the
fire
of
this
work
was
not
neutralized
during
the
assault
according
to
verdier
s
expectation
the
main
assault
nevertheless
was
delivered
with
great
energy
despite
the
flanking
fire
at
the
two
points

descended
from

they
were
mown
down
by
the
terrible
musketry
fire
from
the
houses
and
finally
expelled
with
the
bayonet
at
the
santa

curtain
the
italians
scaled
the

were
brought
up
by
a
perpendicular
drop
of
twelve
feet

time

finally
worsted
in
a
long
and
furious
exchange
of
fire
with
the
spaniards
on
the
roofs
and
churches
before
them
and
recoiled
the
few
surviving
officers
rallied
the
stormers
and
brought
them
up
for
a
second
assault
but
at
the
end
of
two
hours
of
hard
fighting
all
were
constrained
to
retire
to
their
trenches
they
had
lost
killed
and
wounded
including
three
colonels
the
only
three
surviving
in
the
whole
of
verdier
s
corps
and
thirty
other
officers
the
spanish
loss
had
been
among
them

verdier
accused
his
troops
of
cowardice
which
seems
to
have
been
unjust
cyr
wrote
to
the
minister
of
war
to
express
his
opinion
that
his
subordinate
was
making
an
excuse
to
cover
his
own
error
in
judging
that
a
town
must
fall
merely
because
there
were
large
breaches
in
its
walls
the
columns
stopped
for
ninety
minutes
on
the
breaches
under
as
heavy
a
fire
as
has
ever
been
seen
there
was
some
disorder
at
the
end
but
that
is
not
astonishing
in
view
of
the
heavy
loss
suffered
before
the
retreat
i
do
not
think
that
picked
grenadiers
would
have
done
any
better
and
i
am
convinced
that
the
assault
failed
because
the
obstacles
to
surmount
were
too
the
fact
was
that
the
spaniards
had
fought
with
such
admirable
obstinacy
and
had
so
well
arranged
their
inner
defences
that
it
did
not
suffice
that
the
breaches
should
have
been
perfectly
practicable
at
the
northern
assault
the
stormers
actually
penetrated
into
the
buildings
behind
the
gaps
in
the
ruined
wall
but
could
not
get
further
forward
in
short
the
history
of
the
siege
of
gerona
gives
a
clear
corroboration
of
the
old
military
axiom
that
no
town
should
ever
surrender
merely
because
it
has
been
breached
and
justifies
napoleon
s
order
that
every
governor
who
capitulated
without
having
stood
at
least
one
assault
should
be
sent
before
a
court
martial
it
refutes
the
excuses
of
the
too
numerous
commanders
who
have
surrendered
merely
because
there
was
a
practicable
breach
in
their
walls
like
imaz
at
badajoz
in
if
all
spanish
generals
had
been
as
wary
and
as
resolute
as
mariano
alvarez
the
peninsular
war
would
have
taken
some
unexpected
turns
the
moral
of
the
defences
of
tarifa
burgos
and
san
sebastian
will
be
found
to
be
the
same
as
that
of
the
defence
of
gerona
il

to
the

the
not
unnatural
suggestion
that
the
german
and
italian
troops
may
have
failed
to
display
such
desperate
courage
as
the
native
french
in
the
assault
seems
to
be
refuted
by
their
losses
which
were
hardly
smaller
in
proportion
of
native
french
of
the
and
line
and
léger
were
put
out
of
action
of
berg
würzburg
and
italian
troops
the
difference
in
the
percentage
is
so
small
that
it
is
clear
that
there
was
no
great
difference
in
conduct
the
effect
of
the
repulse
of
september
on
the
besieging
army
was
appalling
verdier
after
writing
three
venomous
letters
to
the
emperor
the
war
minister
and
marshal
augereau
in
which
he
accused
cyr
of
having
deliberately
sacrificed
the
good
of
the
service
to
his
personal
resentments
declared
himself
invalided
he
then
went
off
to
perpignan
though
permission
to
depart
was
expressly
denied
him
by
his
superior
his
divisional
generals
lecchi
and
morio
had
already
preceded
him

france
disgust
at
the
failure
of

effect

fortnight
that
followed

by

little
more
than

just
enough
to
hold
monjuich

the

by
the
great
dépôts
at

and
sarria
the
store
of

in
the
park
had
been
used
up
for
the
tremendous
bombardment
poured
upon
the

from
the
to
the
of

a
new

was
wanted
from

on

left

came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
useless
to
proceed
with
the
attack
by
means
of
trenches
batteries
and
assaults
and
frankly
stated
that
he
should
starve
the
town
out
but
waste
no
further
lives
on
active
operations
he
drew
in
the
covering
corps
closer
to
gerona
so
that
it
could
take
a
practical
part
in
the
investment
put
the
wrecks
of
lecchi
s
troops
of
whom
less
than
survived
into
pino
s
division
and
sent
the
french
brigade
of
verdier
s
old
division
to
guard
the
line
between
bascara
and
the
frontier
thus
the
distinction
between
the
and
the
covering
troops
ceased
to
exist
and
cyr
lay
with
some
men
in
a
loose
circle
round
gerona
intent
not
on
prosecuting
advances
against
the
walls
but
only
on
preventing
the
introduction
of
further
succours
he
was
aware
that
acute
privations

more
than
eight

the

who
still
survived

was
a
considerable
amount
of

left
in

little

meat

gone

for
alvarez

just
begun
to
butcher
his
draught
horses

those
of
his

was
some
small

of
chocolate
tobacco

all

been
burnt
early
in

and

in

or
casemates
for
safety
died
off
like
flies
in
the
underground
air
the
seeds
of
pestilence
were
spread
by
the
number
of
dead
bodies

men
and

were
lying
where
they
could
not
be
reached
under

spirit

of

still

the

the
cessation
of
the
bombardment
for
many
days
after
had
encouraged
them
but
they
were
beginning
to
murmur
more
and
more
bitterly
against
blake
there
was
a
general
if
erroneous
opinion
that
he
ought
to
have
risked
a
battle
instead
of
merely
throwing
in
provisions
on
september
alvarez
himself
shared
this
view
and
wrote
in
vigorous
terms
to
the
junta
of
catalonia
to
ask
if
his
garrison
was
to
perish

he
committed
the
egregious
fault
of
omitting
to
threaten
other
parts
of
the
line
of

so
as
to
draw
off
cyr

attention
from
the
crucial
point
he
trusted
to

having
succeeded
in
concentrating
his
army
without
being
discovered
by
the
french
who
thought
him
still
far
away
beyond

thus
it
came
to

that
though
o

struck
sharply
in
defeated
an
italian
regiment
near
castellar
and
another
three
miles
further
on
and
reached

with
the
head

yet
the
rest
of
pino

upon

flank

because
they
were
not
drawn
off
by

in

quarters
they
broke
in
between

captured
all

next

without
offering
to

the
amount
of
food
which

was
trifling
and
alvarez
declared
that
he
had
no
need
for
the
additional
mouths
of
o
donnell

four
battalions
and
refused
to
admit

cyr
betook
himself
to
perpignan
in
order
as
he
explained
to
the
minister
of

to
hurry
up
provisions
to
the

at
the
front
and
to
compel
the
officers
at

base
to
send
forward
some

convalescents
fit
to
march
whose
services
had
been
persistently
denied
him
arrived
there
he
heard
that
augereau
whose
gout
had
long
disappeared
was
perfectly
fit
to
take
the
field
and
could
have
done
so
long
before
if
he
had
not
preferred
to
shift
on
to
other
shoulders

responsibility
for
the

gravely

convinced
that
the

had
still
a
long
time
to
run

eager
to
do
an
ill
turn
to
the
officer

had
intrigued

played
on
the

precisely
the

trick
that

played
on
himself
a
fortnight
before

announced
that

was

wrote
to
congratulate
augereau
on

convalescence

to
resign
the
command
to
his
hands
and
departed
to
his
home
without
waiting
for
an
answer
or
obtaining
leave
from

a
daring
act
as

enraged

that

the
night
following

arrival
was
disturbed
by
an
exciting
incident
henry
o
donnell
from
his
refuge
on
the
capuchin
heights
had
been
watching
for
a
fortnight
for
a
good
chance
of
escape
there
was
a
dense
fog
on
the
night
of
the
taking
advantage
of
it
o
donnell
came
down
with
his
brigade
made
a
circuit
round
the
town
crossed
the
oña
and
struck
straight
away
into
the
plain
of
salt
which
being
the
most
open
and
exposed
was
also
the
least
guarded
section
of
the
french
lines
of
investment
he
broke
through
the
chain
of
vedettes
almost
without
firing
and
came
rushing
before
dawn
into
souham
s
camp
on
the
heights
of
aguaviva
the
battalion
sleeping
there
was
scattered
and
the
general
forced
to
fly
in
his
shirt
o
donnell
swept
off
his
and
baggage
as
also
some
prisoners
and
was
out
of
reach
in
half
an
hour
before
the
rallying
fractions
of
the
french
division
came
up
to
the
rescue
of
their
chief
by
six
o
clock
the
escaping
column
was
in
safety
in
the
mountains
by
santa
coloma
where
it
joined
the
miqueletes
of
milans
for
this
daring
exploit
o
donnell
was
made
a
by
the
supreme
junta
his
departure
was
a
great
relief
to
alvarez
who
had
to
husband
every
mouthful
of
food
and
had
already
put
both
the
garrison
and
the
townsfolk
on
of
flour
and
horseflesh
augereau
was
in
every
way
inferior
as
an
officer
to
cyr
an
old
soldier
of
fortune
risen
from
the
ranks
he
had
little
education
or
military
science
his
one
virtue
was
headlong
courage
on
the
battlefield
yet
when
placed
in
supreme
command
he
often
hesitated
and
showed
hopeless
indecision
he
had
been
lucky
enough
to
earn
a
great
reputation
as
napoleon
s
in
the
old
campaigns
of
italy
in
since
then
he
had
made
his
fortune
by
becoming
one
of
the
emperor
s
most
zealous
tools
and
flatterers
he
was
reckoned
a
blind
and
reckless
bonapartist
ready
to
risk
anything
for
his
master
but
spoilt
his
reputation
for
sincerity
by
deserting
him
at
the
first
opportunity
in
he
was
inclined
to
a
harsh
interpretation
of
the
laws
of
war
and
enjoyed
a
doubtful
reputation
for
financial
integrity
yet
he
was
prone
to
ridiculous
proclamations
and
manifestos
written
in
a
bombastic
strain
which
he
vainly
imagined
to
resemble
his
master

consider
the
ills
which
surround
you
with
what
tranquillity
do
your
leaders
look
upon
the
graves
crammed
with
your
corpses
are
you
not
at
these
cannibals
whose
mirth
bursts
out
in
the
midst
of
the
human
hecatomb
and
who
yet
dare
to
lift
their
gory
hands
in
prayer
towards

warn
you

last

while
you
still
may
if
you
force
me

aside
my
usual
mildness
your
ruin
is
inevitable
i
shall
be
the
first
to

at

impose

persist
in
their
obstinacy
thou
shalt
perish

signed
stuff
of
this
sort
was
not
likely
to
have
much
effect
on
fanatics
like
alvarez
and
his
if
it
is
so
wrong
to
cause
the
deaths
of
men
they
had
only
to
answer
why
has
bonaparte
sent
his
legions
into
spain
on
the
marshal
s
line
of
argument
that
it
is
wrong
to
resist
overwhelming
force
it
is
apparently
a
sin
before
god
for
any
man
to
attempt
to
defend
his
house
and
family
against
any
bandit
there
is
much
odious
and
hypocritical
nonsense
in
some
of
napoleon
s
bulletins
where
he
grows
tender
on
the
miseries
of
the
people
he
has
conquered
but
nothing
to
approach
the
maunderings
of
his
copyist
augereau
found
the
army
about
gerona
showing
not
more
than
bayonets
fit
for
the
field
gunners
and
sappers
excluded
the
men
were
sick
of
the
siege
and
it
would
seem
that
the
marshal
was
forced
after
inspecting
the
regiments
and
conferring
with
the
generals
to
acquiesce
in
cyr
s
decision
that
any
further
assaults
would
probably
lead
to
more
repulses
he
gave
out
that
he
was
resolved
to
change
the
system
on
which
the
operations
had
hitherto
been
conducted
but
the
change
amounted
to
nothing
more
than
that
he
ordered
a
slow
but
steady
bombardment
to
be
kept
up
and
occasionally
vexed
the
spaniards
by
demonstrations
against
the
more
exposed
points
of
the
wall
it
does
not
appear
that
either
of
these
expedients
had
the
least
effect
in
shaking
the
morale
of
the
garrison
it
is
true
that
during
october
and
november
the
hearts
of
the
geronese
were
commencing
to
grow
sick
but
this
was
solely
the
result
of
starvation
and
dwindling
numbers
as
to
the
bombardment
they
were
now
hardened
to
any
amount
of
dropping
fire
on
october
they
celebrated
the
feast
of
san
narciso
their
patron
by
a
procession
all
round
the
town
which
was
under
fire
for
the
whole
time
of
its
progress
and
paid
no
attention
to
the
casualties
which
it
cost
them
meanwhile
when
the
second
half
of
october
had
begun
blake
made
the
third
and
last
of
his
attempts
to
throw
succours
into
gerona
it
was
even
more
feebly
carried
out
than
that
of
september
for
the
army
employed
was
less
numerous
blake
s
force
had
not
received
any
reinforcement
to
make
up
for
the
men
lost
in
the
last
affair
a
fact
that
seems
surprising
since
valencia
ought
now
to
have
been
able
to
send
him
the
remainder
of
the
regiments
which
had
been
reorganized
since
the
disasters
of
june
but
it
would
seem
that
josé
caro
who
was
in
command
in
that
province
and
the
local
junta
made
excuses
for
retaining
as
many
men
as
possible
and
cared
little
for
the
danger
of
gerona
so
long
as
the
war
was
kept
far
from
their
own
frontier
it
was
at
any
rate
with
no
more
than
or
men
the
remains
of
his
original
force
that
blake
once
more
came
forward
on
october
and
threatened
the
blockading
army
by
demonstrations
both
from
the
side
of
la
bispal
and
that
of
santa
coloma
he
had
again
collected
a
considerable
amount
of
food
at
hostalrich
but
had
not
yet
formed
a
convoy
apparently
he
was
waiting
to
discover
the
weakest
point
in
the
french
lines
before
risking
his
mules
and
his
stores
both
of
which
were
by
now
very
hard
to
procure
there
followed
a
fortnight
of
confused
skirmishing
without
any
battle
though
augereau
tried
with
all
his
might
to
force
on
a
general
engagement
one
of
his
italian
brigades
was
roughly
handled
near
la
bispal
on
the
and
another
repulsed
near
santa
coloma
on
the
but
on
each
occasion
when
the
french
reinforcements
came
up
blake
gave
back
and
refused
to
fight
on
november
the
whole
of
souham
s
division
marched
on
santa
coloma
and
forced
loygorri
and
henry
o
donnell
to
evacuate
it
and
retire
to
the
mountains
souham
reported
that
he
had
inflicted
a
loss
of
men
on
the
spaniards
at
the
cost
of
eleven
killed
and
wounded
on
his
own
side
the
real
casualty
list
of
the
two
spanish
divisions
seems
to
have
been
somewhat
over
men
see
souham
s
dispatch

to
make
the
combat
into
a
very
big
business

nothing
decisive
had
taken
place
up
to
november
when
augereau
conceived
the
idea
that
he
might
make
an
end
of
blake
s
fruitless
but
vexatious
demonstrations
by
dealing
a
sudden
blow
at
his
magazines
in
hostalrich
if
these
were
destroyed
it
would
cost
the
spaniards
much
time
to
collect
another
store
of
provisions
for
gerona
accordingly
pino
marched
with
three
brigades
to
storm
the
town
which
was
protected
only
by
a
dilapidated
mediaeval
wall
unfurnished
with
guns
though
the
castle
which
dominated
it
was
a
place
of
considerable
strength
and
proof
against
a
de
only
one
of
blake
s
divisions
that
of
cuadrado
less
than
strong
was
in
this
quarter
and
augereau
found
employment
for
the
others
by
sending
some
of
souham
s
troops
against
them
the
expedition
succeeded
while
mazzuchelli
s
brigade
occupied
the
attention
of
cuadrado
the
rest
of
the
italians
stormed
hostalrich
which
was
defended
only
by
its
own
inhabitants
and
the
small
garrison
of
the
castle
the
spaniards
were
driven
up
into
that
stronghold
after
a
lively
fight
and
all
the
magazines
fell
into
pino
s
hands
and
were
burnt
at
a
cost
of
only
killed
and
wounded
the
food
which
blake
had
collected
with
so
much
difficulty
was
destroyed
thereupon
the
spanish
general
gave
up
the
attempt
to
succour
gerona
and
withdrew
to
the
plain
of
vich
to
recommence
the
sisyphean
task
of
getting
together
one
more
convoy
it
was
not
destined
to
be
of
any
use
to
alvarez
and
his
gallant
garrison
for
by
the
time
that
it
was
collected
the
siege
had
arrived
at
its
final
stage
see
pino
s
and
augereau
s
dispatches
in
belmas
s
appendices
nos
and
the
geronese
were
now
reaching
the
end
of
their
strength
for
the
first
time
since
the
investment
began
in
may
some
of
the
defenders
began
to
show
signs
of
slackening
the
heavy
rains
of
october
and
the
commencement
of
the
cold
season
were
reducing
alike
troops
and
inhabitants
to
a
desperate
condition
they
had
long
used
up
all
their
fuel
and
found
the
chill
of
winter
intolerable
in
their
cellars
and
casemates
alvarez
though
reduced
to
a
state
of
physical
prostration
by
dysentery
and
fever
was
still
steadfast
in
heart
but
there
was
discontent
brewing
among
some
of
his
subordinates
it
is
notable
as
showing
the
spirit
of
the
time
that
the
malcontents
were
found
among
the
professional
soldiers
not
among
the
citizens
early
in
november
several
officers
were
found
holding
secret
conferences
and
drawing
up
an
address
to
the
local
junta
setting
forth
the
desperate
state
of
the
city
and
the
necessity
for
deposing
the
governor
who
was
represented
as
incapacitated
for
command
by
reason
of
his
illness
it
was
apparently
hinted
that
he
was
going
mad
or
was
intermittently
delirious
some
of
the
wild
sayings
attributed
to
alvarez
during
the
later
days
of
the
siege
might
be
quoted
as
a
support
for
their
representations
to
a
captain
who
asked
to
what
point
he
was
expected
to
retire
if
he
were
driven
from
his
post
it
is
said
that
he
answered
to
the
to
another
officer
the
first
who
dared
to
say
that
capitulation
was
inevitable
because
of
the
exhaustion
of
the
magazines
he
replied
when
the
last
food
is
gone
we
will
start
eating
the
cowards
and
we
will
begin
with
though
aware
that
their
conspiracies
were
known
the
malcontents
did
not
desist
from
their
efforts
and
alvarez
made
preparations
for
seizing
and
shooting
the
chiefs
but
on
the
night
of
november
eight
of
them
including
three
warned
by
a
traitor
of
their
approaching
fate
fled
to
augereau
s
camp
their
arrival
was
the
most
encouraging
event
for
the
french
that
had
occurred
since
the
commencement
of
the
siege
they
spoke
freely
of
the
exhaustion
of
the
garrison
and
said
that
alvarez
was
mad
and
moribund
alvarez
s
letter
to
blake
of
printed
in
arteche
s
appendix
no
of
his
vol
vii
gives
this
account
of
the
first
discovery
of
plots
of
whom
two
strangely
enough
had
been
specially
mentioned
for
courage
at
the
september
assault
it
was
apparently
this
information
concerning
the
desperate
state
of
the
garrison
which
induced
augereau
to
recommence
active
siege
operations
he
ordered
up
ammunition
from
perpignan
to
fill
the
empty
magazines
and
when
it
arrived
began
to
batter
a
new
breach
in
the
curtain
of
santa
lucia
on
december
pino
s
italians
stormed
the
suburb
of
la
marina
outside
the
southern
end
of
the
town
a
quarter
hitherto
unassailed
and
made
a
lodgement
therein
as
if
to
open
a
new
point
of
attack
but
this
was
only
done
to
distract
the
enemy
from
the
real
design
of
the
marshal
which
was
nothing
less
than
to
cut
off
the
forts
on
the
capuchin
heights
from
gerona
by
seizing
the
redoubts
those
of
the
chapter
and
the
city
which
covered
the
steep
upward
path
from
the
walls
to
the
group
of
works
on
the
hilltop
at
midnight
on
december
the
voltigeur
and
grenadier
companies
of
pino
s
division
climbed
the
rough
southern
face
of
the
capuchin
heights
and
surprised
and
escaladed
the
redoubt
of
the
city
putting
the
garrison
to
the
sword
next
morning
the
batteries
of
the
forts
above
and
the
city
below
opened
a
furious
fire
upon
the
lost
redoubt
and
alvarez
directed
his
last
sally
sending
out
every
man
that
he
could
collect
to
recover
the
work
this
led
to
a
long
and
bloody
fight
on
the
slopes
which
ended
most
disastrously
for
the
garrison
not
only
was
the
sortie
repulsed
but
in
the
confusion
the
french
carried
the
calvary
and
chapter
redoubts
the
other
works
which
guarded
the
access
from
gerona
to
the
upper
forts
on
the
afternoon
of
december
the
communication
with
them
was
completely
cut
off
and
as
their
garrisons
possessed
no
separate
magazines
and
had
been
wont
to
receive
their
daily
dole
from
the
city
it
was
clear
that
they
must
be
starved
out
they
had
only
food
for
hours
at
the
moment
napier
ii
says
that
the
sortie
was
so
far
successful
that
the
geronese
opened
the
way
for
the
garrison
of
the
constable
fort
to
escape
into
the
city
but
i
can
find
no
authority
for
this
in
either
the
french
or
the
spanish
narratives
see
especially
vacani
the
excitement
of
the
sally
had
drained
away
the
governor
s
last
strength
he
took
to
his
bed
that
evening
was
in
delirium
next
day
and
on
the
morning
of
the
ninth
received
the
last
sacraments
of
the
church
the
doctors
having
declared
that
his
hours
were
numbered
his
last
conscious
act
was
to
protest
against
any
proposal
to
surrender
before
he
handed
over
the
command
to
the
senior
officer
present
general
juliano
bolivar
had
alvarez
retained
his
senses
it
is
certain
that
an
attempt
would
have
been
made
to
hold
the
town
even
when
the
starving
garrisons
of
the
forts
should
have
surrendered
but
the
moment
that
his
stern
hand
was
removed
his
successor
bolivar
called
together
a
council
of
war
to
which
the
members
of
the
junta
no
less
than
the
officers
commanding
corps
were
invited
they
voted
that
further
resistance
was
impossible
and
sent
out
fournas
the
man
who
had
so
well
defended
monjuich
to
obtain
terms
from
augereau
on
the
morning
of
the
tenth
the
marshal
received
him
and
dictated
a
simple
surrender
without
any
of
the
favourable
conditions
which
fournas
at
first
demanded
his
only
concession
was
that
he
offered
to
exchange
the
garrison
for
an
equal
number
of
the
unhappy
prisoners
from
dupont
s
army
now
lying
in
misery
on
the
pontoons
at
cadiz
if
the
supreme
junta
concurred
but
the
bargain
was
never
ratified
as
the
authorities
at
seville
were
obdurate
on
the
morning
of
december
the
survivors
of
the
garrison
marched
out
and
laid
down
their
arms
on
the
glacis
of
the
mercadal
only
men
came
forth
these
looked
like
living
spectres
so
pale
weak
and
tattered
that
the
besiegers
as
observed
felt
ashamed
to
have
been
held
at
bay
so
long
by
dying
there
were
more
lying
in
the
hospitals
the
rest
of
the
who
had
defended
the
place
from
may
or
had
entered
with
garcia
conde
in
september
were
dead
a
detailed
inspection
of
figures
shows
that
of
the
men
of
alvarez
s
original
command
only
survived
while
of
the
who
had
come
later
there
were
still
left
of
the
old
garrison
and
of
the
succours
had
perished
the
mortality
by
famine
and
disease
far
exceeded
that
by
the
sword
men
had
died
in
the
hospitals
in
october
and
in
november
from
mere
exhaustion
the
town
was
in
a
dreadful
state
about
of
the
inhabitants
had
perished
including
nearly
all
the
very
young
and
the
very
old
bombs
and
shells
had
been
thrown
into
the
unhappy
city
it
presented
a
melancholy
vista
of
houses
roofless
or
with
one
or
two
of
the
knocked
in
of
streets
blocked
by
the
fallen
masonry
of
churches
or
towers
under
which
corpses
were
partially
buried
the
open
spaces
were
strewn
with
broken
muskets
bloody
rags
wheels
of
disabled
guns
and
carts
fragments
of
shells
and
the
bones
of
horses
and
mules
whose
flesh
had
been
eaten
the
stench
was
so
dreadful
that
augereau
had
to
keep
his
troops
out
of
the
place
lest
infection
should
be
bred
among
them
in
the
magazines
nothing
was
found
save
a
little
unground
corn
all
the
other
provisions
had
been
exhausted
there
were
also
cannon
mostly
disabled
about
lb
of
powder
and
a
million
musket
cartridges
the
military
chest
handed
over
contained
reals
about
sterling
augereau
behaved
very
harshly
to
the
garrison
many
feeble
or
diseased
men
were
made
to
march
to
perpignan
and
perished
by
the
way
the
priests
and
monks
of
the
crusade
were
informed
that
they
were
combatants
and
sent
off
with
the
soldiery
but
the
fate
of
the
gallant
governor
provokes
especial
indignation
alvarez
did
not
die
of
his
fever
when
he
was
somewhat
recovered
he
was
forwarded
to
perpignan
and
from
thence
to
narbonne
where
he
was
kept
for
some
time
and
seemed
convalescent
orders
then
came
from
paris
that
he
was
to
be
sent
back
to
spain
apparently
to
be
tried
as
a
traitor
for
it
was
alleged
that
in
the
spring
of
he
had
accepted
the
provisional
government
installed
by
murat
he
was
separated
from
his
and
servants
and
passed
on
from
dungeon
to
dungeon
till
he
reached
figueras
the
day
after
his
arrival
at
that
place
he
was
found
dead
on
a
barrow
the
only
bed
granted
him
in
the
dirty
cellar
where
he
had
been
placed
it
is
probable
that
he
perished
from
natural
causes
but
many
spaniards
believed
that
he
had
been
murdered
for
details
of
this
disgraceful
cruelty
see
arteche
s
elogio
on
alvarez
in
the
proceedings
of
the
madrid
academy
the
emperor
napoleon
himself
must
bear
the
responsibility
as
it
was
by
orders
from
paris
that
alvarez
was
sent
back
from
france
to
figueras
apparently
he
was
to
be
tried
at
barcelona
and
perhaps
executed
there
is
no
allusion
to
the
matter
in
the
de
great
as
the
losses
of
the
garrison
of
gerona
had
been
they
were
far
exceeded
both
positively
and
proportionately
by
those
of
the
besieging
army
the
french
official
returns
show
that
on
june
the
three
divisions
charged
with
the
attack
those
of
verdier
morio
and
lecchi
had
bayonets
and
the
two
divisions
of
the
covering
army
those
of
souham
and
pino
there
were
artillerymen
and
engineers
over
and
above
these
figures
on
december
twenty
days
after
the
surrender
and
when
the
regiments
had
been
joined
by
most
of
their
convalescents
the
three
counted
men
the
covering
divisions
and
the
artillery
and
engineers
this
shows
a
loss
of
over
men
but
on
examination
the
deficit
is
seen
to
be
even
larger
for
two
new
battalions
from
france
had
just
joined
verdier
s
division
in
december
and
their
bayonets
should
be
deducted
from
his
total
it
would
seem
then
that
the
capture
of
gerona
cost
the
corps
about
men
as
well
as
a
whole
campaigning
season
from
april
to
december
the
attack
on
catalonia
had
been
brought
to
a
complete
standstill
and
when
gerona
fell
the
french
occupied
nothing
but
the
ruined
city
the
fortresses
of
rosas
and
figueras
hard
by
the
frontier
and
the
isolated
barcelona
where
duhesme
with
the
men
of
his
division
had
been
lying
quiescent
all

those

were
indulging
in

exchange
of
recriminations
and

when
it
was
all
too
late
blake
after
retiring
to
vich
on
november
informed
the
junta
of
catalonia
that
he
was
helpless
unless
more
men
could
be
found
and
that
they
must
find
them
why
he
did
not
rather
insist
that
the
valencian
reserves
should
be
brought
up
and
risk
stripping
tarragona
and
lerida
of
their
regular
garrisons
it
is
hard
to
say
this
at
any
rate
would
have
been
in
his
power
the
catalan
junta
replied
by
summoning
a
congress
at
manresa
on
november
to
which
representatives
of
every
district
of
the
principality
were
invited
the
congress
voted
that
a
levy
of
all
the
men
from
seventeen
to
years
of
age
should
be
called
out
and
authorized
a
loan
of
reals
for
equipping
them
they
also
wrote
to
seville
not
for
the
first
time
to
demand
reinforcements
from
the
central
junta
but
the
battle
of
ocaña
had
just
been
fought
and
lost
and
andalusia
could
not
have
spared
a
man
even
if
there
had
been
time
to
transport
troops
to
tarragona
all
that
the
catalans
received
was
honorary
votes
of
approval
for
the
gallant
behaviour
of
the
geronese
the
levy
was
actually
begun
but
there
was
an
insuperable
difficulty
in
collecting
and
equipping
the
men
in
winter
time
when
days
were
short
and
roads
were
bad
the
weeks
passed
by
and
gerona
fell
long
before
enough
men
had
been
got
together
to
induce
blake
to
try
a
new
offensive
movement
why
was
the
congress
not
called
in
september
rather
than
in
november
blake
had
always
declared
that
he
was
too
weak
to
risk
a
battle
with
the
french
for
the
raising
of
the
siege
but
till
the
last
moment
the
catalans
contented
themselves
with
arguing
with
him
and
writing
remonstrances
to
the
central
junta
instead
of
lending
him
the
aid
of
their
last
levies
the
proclamation
of
ordering
this
levy
written
in
a
very
magniloquent
style
may
be
found
in

appendix
no
one
or
two
points
connected
with
this
famous
siege
require
a
word
of
comment
it
is
quite
clear
that
cyr
during
its
early
stages
did
not
try
his
honest
best
to
help
verdier
during
june
and
july
his
covering
army
was
doing
no
good
whatever
at
vich
he
pretended
that
he
had
placed
it
there
in
order
to
ward
off
possible
attacks
by
blake
but
it
was
matter
of
public
knowledge
that
blake
was
far
away
in
aragon
engaged
in
his
unhappy
campaign
against
suchet
and
that
coupigny
left
at
tarragona
with
a
few
thousand
men
was
not
a
serious
danger
cyr
could
have
spared
a
whole
division
more
for
the
siege
operations
without
risking
anything
if
he
had
done
so
gerona
could
have
been
approached
on
two
sides
instead
of
one
the
mercadal
front
might
have
been
attacked
and
the
loose
blockade
which
was
all
that
verdier
could
keep
up
for
want
of
more
men
might
have
been
made
effective
but
cyr
all
through
his
military
career
earned
a
reputation
for
callous
selfishness
and
habitual
leaving
of
his
colleagues
in
the
lurch
on
this
occasion
he
was
bitterly
offended
with
verdier
for
giving
himself
the
airs
of
an
equal
and
corresponding
directly
with
the
emperor
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
took
a
malicious
pleasure
in
seeing
his
failures
it
is
hardly
disguised
in
his
clever
and
plausible

the
first
point
seems
unjust
to
cyr
from
his
position
in
front
of
tarragona
after
valls
he
had
no
real
chance
of
combining
his
operations
with
the
army
of
aragon
but
the
other
three
charges
seem
well
founded
verdier
on
the
other
hand
seems
to
have
felt
all
through
that
he
was
being
asked
to
perform
a
task
almost
impossible
when
he
was
set
to
take
gerona
with
his
own
men
unaided
by
the
covering
army
his
only
receipt
for
success
was
to
try
to
hurry
on
the
matter
by
delivering
desperate
blows
both
the
assault
on
monjuich
on
july
and
that
on
the
city
on
september
were
premature
there
was
some
excuse
for
the
former
verdier
had
not
yet
realized
how
well
alvarez
could
fight
but
the
second
seems
unpardonable
after
the
warning
received
at
monjuich
if
the
general
as
he
declared
before
delivering
his
assault
mistrusted
his
own
troops
he
had
no
right
to
order
a
storm
at
all
considering
his
experience
of
the
way
in
which
the
spaniards
had
behaved
in
july
he
acted
on
the
fallacious
theory
that
a
practicable
breach
implies
a
town
that
can
be
taken
which
is
far
from
being
the
case
if
the
garrison
are
both
desperate
and
ingenious
in
defending
themselves
the
only
way
to
deal
with
such
a
resolute
and
capable
adversary
was
to
proceed
by
the
slow
and
regular
methods
of
siegecraft
to
sap
right
up
to
the
ditch
before
delivering
an
assault
and
batter
everything
to
pieces
before
risking
a
man
this
was
how
monjuich
was
actually
taken
after
the
storm
had
failed
having
neither
established
himself
close
under
the
walls
nor
subdued
the
flanking
fires
from
the
calvary
and
chapter
redoubts
nor
ascertained
how
far
the
spaniards
had
prepared
inner
defences
for
themselves
he
had
no
right
to
attack
at
all
as
to
blake
even
after
making
all
possible
allowances
for
the
fact
that
he
could
not
trust
his
troops
the
wrecks
of
maria
and
belchite
for
a
battle
in
the
field
he
must
yet
be
pronounced
guilty
of
feebleness
and
want
of
ingenuity
if
he
could
never
bring
up
enough
regulars
to
give
him
a
chance
of
facing
cyr
the
fault
was
largely
his
own
a
more
forcible
general
would
have
insisted
that
the
valencian
reserves
should
march
and
would
have
stripped
lerida
and
tarragona
of
men
it
could
safely
have
been
done
for
neither
suchet
nor
duhesme
was
showing
any
signs
of
threatening
those
points
he
might
have
insisted
that
the
catalan
junta
should
call
out
the
full
levy
of
in
september
instead
of
in
november
he
might
also
have
made
a
better
use
of
the
irregulars
already
in
the
field
the
bands
of
rovira
milans
and
claros
these
miqueletes
did
admirable
service
all
through
the
siege
by
harassing
verdier
s
rear
and
cutting
off
his
convoys
but
they
were
not
employed
as
they
should
have
been
in
combination
with
the
regulars
but
allowed
as
a
rule
to
go
off
on
excursions
of
their
own
which
had
no
relation
to
the
main
objects
of
blake
s
strategy
the
only
occasion
on
which
proper
use
was
made
of
them
was
when
on
september
they
were
set
to
threaten
verdier
s
lines
while
garcia
conde
s
convoy
was
approaching
gerona
it
may
be
pleaded
in
the
spanish
general
s
defence
that
it
was
difficult
to
exact
obedience
from
the
chiefs
there
was
a
distinct
coolness
between
the
regulars
and
the
irregulars
which
sometimes
led
to
actual
quarrels
and
conflicts
when
they
met
but
here
again
the
reply
is
that
more
forcible
were
able
to
control
the
miqueletes
and
if
blake
failed
to
do
so
it
was
only
one
more
sign
of
his
inadequacy
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
the
conclusion
that
he
mismanaged
matters
and
that
if
in
his
second
and
third
attempts
to
relieve
gerona
he
had
repeated
the
tactics
of
his
first
he
would
have
had
a
far
better
chance
of
success
on
september
only
did
he
make
any
scientific
attempt
to
distract
the
enemy
s
attention
and
forces
and
on
that
occasion
he
was
successful
summing
things
up
it
may
be
said
that
he
was
not
wrong
to
refuse
battle
with
the
troops
that
he
had
actually
brought
up
to
gerona
they
would
undoubtedly
have
been
routed
if
he
had
risked
a
general
engagement
his
fault
was
that
he
did
not
bring
up
larger
forces
when
it
was
in
his
power
to
do
so
by
the
exercise
of
compulsion
on
the
catalan
and
valencian
juntas
but
these
bodies
must
share
blake
s
responsibilities
they
undoubtedly
behaved
in
a
slack
and
selfish
fashion
and
let
gerona
perish
though
it
was
keeping
the
war
from
their
doors
for
a
long
eight
months
the
valencian
troops
at
maria
were
eleven

savoia
three
and
cazadores

valencia

of
these
only

now
two

only
and
voluntarios
de
valencia
turned
up
for
the
relief
of
gerona
along
with
them
came
two
fresh
regiments
cazadores
of
orihuela
and
almanza
which
had
not
been
at
maria
but
these
were
murcian
not
valencian
troops
all
the
more
credit
is
due
to
alvarez
considering
the
way
in
which
he
was
left
unsuccoured
and
fed
with
vain
promises
a
less
constant
soul
would
have
abandoned
the
defence
long
before
the
last
two
months
of
resistance
were
his
sole
work
if
he
had
fallen
sick
in
october
instead
of
december
his
subordinates
would
have
yielded
long
before
but
it
is
not
merely
for
heroic
obstinacy
that
he
must
be
praised
every
detail
of
the
defence
shows
that
he
was
a
most
ingenious
and
provident
general
nothing
was
left
undone
to
make
the
work
of
the
besiegers
hard
moreover
as
napier
has
observed
it
is
not
the
least
of
his
titles
to
merit
that
he
preserved
a
strict
discipline
and
exacted
the
possible
maximum
of
work
from
soldier
and
civilian
alike
without
the
use
of
any
of
those
wholesale
executions
which
disgraced
the
defence
of
saragossa
his
words
were
sometimes
truculent
but
his
acts
were
just
and
moderate
he
never
countenanced
as
did
palafox
yet
he
was
far
better
obeyed
by
the
citizens
and
got
as
good
service
from
them
as
did
the
aragonese
commander
he
showed
that
good
organization
is
not
incompatible
with
patriotic
enthusiasm
and
is
far
more
effective
in
the
hour
of
danger
than
reckless
courage

retreat
from

to
badajoz
and

for

the
secretary

to

to

he
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
the
troops
of
victor
mortier
and
soult
were
making
a
general
movement
to
the
rear
and
that
the
moment
had
arrived
when
the
allied
armies
in
estremadura
and
la
mancha
should
move
forward
with
the
greatest
activity
either
to
observe
more
closely
the
movements
of
the
enemy
or
to
attack
him
when
circumstances
may
render
it
expedient
the
french
movement
of
retreat
was
wholly
imaginary
and
it
is
astonishing
that
the
spanish
government
should
have
been
so
mad
as
to
believe
it
possible
that
their
retrograde
movement
may
have
originated
in
accounts
received
from
the
north
which
compel
the
enemy
either
to
retire
into
the
interior
of
france
or
to
take
up
a
position
nearer
to
the

groundless
rumour
of
the
highest
intrinsic
improbability
they
were
ready
to
hurl
the
troops
of
eguia
and
venegas
upon
the
french
and
to
invite
wellington
to
join
in
the
advance
irresponsible
frivolity
could
go
no
further
but
the
junta
as
has
been
already
said
were
eager
for
a
military
success
which
should
cause
their
unpopularity
to
be
forgotten
and
were
ready
to
seize
on
any
excuse
for
ordering
their
troops
forward
this
particular
rumour
died
away
the
french
were
still
in
force
on
the
tagus
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
only
movement
northwards
on
their
part
had
been
the
return
of
ney
s
corps
to
salamanca
but
though
the
truth
was
soon
discovered
the
junta
only
began
to
look
out
for
new
excuses
for
recommencing
active
operations
de
garay
to
wellesley
in
wellington
when
these
schemes
were
laid
before
him
reiterated
his
refusal
to
join
in
any
offensive
campaign
pointed
out
that
the
allied
forces
were
not
strong
enough
to
embark
on
any
such
hazardous
undertaking
and
bluntly
expressed
his
opinion
that
he
was
much
afraid
from
what
he
had
seen
of
the
proceedings
of
the
central
junta
that
in
the
distribution
of
their
forces
they
do
not
consider
military
defence
and
military
operations
so
much
as
political
intrigue
and
the
attainment
of
petty
political
he
then
proceeded
to
make
an
estimate
of
the
french
armies
to
show
their
numerical
superiority
to
the
allies
in
this
he
very
much
the
enemy
s
resources

the
whole
force
of
the
eight
corps
in
spain
at
men
exclusive
of
sick
and
garrisons
not
available
for
active
service
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
were
men
not
with
the
eagles
at
that
moment
after
all
deductions
had
been
made
so
that
his
reasoning
was
far
more
cogent
than
he
supposed
but
this
only
makes
more
culpable
the
obstinate
determination
of
the
junta
to
resume
operations
with
the
much
inferior
force
which
they
had
at
their
disposal
wellington
to
wellesley
from
merida
undismayed
by
their
first
repulse
the
spanish
ministers
were
soon
making
new
representations
to
wellesley
and
wellington
in
order
to
induce
them
to
commit
the
english
army
to
a
forward
policy
they
sent
in
repeated
schemes
for
supplying
wellington
with
food
and
transport
on
a
lavish
scale
but
he
merely
expressed
his
doubts
as
to
whether
orders
that
looked
admirable
on
paper
would
ever
be
carried
out
in
practice
he
consented
for
the
present
to
remain
at
badajoz
as
long
as
he
could
subsist
his
army
in
its
environs
but
warned
the
junta
that
it
was
more
probable
that
he
would
retire
within
the
portuguese
border
for
reasons
of
supply
than
that
he
would
join
in
another
campaign

details
in
wellesley
to
canning
despite
of
all
the
government
at
seville
went
on
with
its
plans
for
a
general
advance
even
after
they
recognized
that
wellington
was
not
to
be
moved
a
grand
plan
of
operations
was
gradually
devised
by
the
cornel
and
his
advisers
stated
shortly
it
was
as
follows
the
army
in
la
mancha
which
venegas
had
rallied
after
the
disaster
of
almonacid
was
to
be
raised
to
a
strength
of
over
men
by
the
drafting
into
it
of
a
full
of
cuesta
s
old
army
of
estremadura
on
september
eguia
marched
eastwards
up
the
guadiana
with
three
divisions
of
infantry
and
twelve
or
thirteen
regiments
of
cavalry
to
join
venegas
the
remaining
force
amounting
to
two
divisions
of
infantry
and
cavalry
was
left
in
estremadura
under
the
duke
of
albuquerque
the
officer
to
whom
the
government
was
obliged
to
assign
this
army
because
the
junta
of
badajoz
pressed
for
his
appointment
and
would
not
hear
of
any
other
commander
he
was
considered
an
anglophil
and
a
friend
of
some
of
the
andalusian
malcontents
so
the
force
left
with
him
was
cut
down
to
the
minimum
all
the
old
regular
regiments
were
withdrawn
from
him
save
one
single
battalion
and
he
was
left
with
nothing
save
the
volunteer
units
some
of
which
had
behaved
so
badly
at
talavera
his
cavalry
was
soon
after
reduced
by
the
order
to
send
a
brigade
to
join
the
army
of
the
north
so
that
he
was
finally
left
with
only
five
regiments
of
that
arm
or
about
sabres
of
his
infantry
about
strong
over
were
absorbed
by
the
garrison
of
badajoz
so
that
he
had
only
men
available
for
service
in
the
field
his
head
quarters
moved
from
truxillo
on
the
seventeenth
were
at
la
serena
on
the
and
joined
the
army
of
la
mancha
about
october
see
the
list
of
albuquerque
s
army
in
appendix
no
there
had
been
regular
battalions
in
cuesta
s
army
in
june
twenty
of
these
marched
off
with
eguia
leaving
only
one
walloon
guards
with
albuquerque
eguia
on
the
other
hand
carried
with
him
to
la
mancha
some
men
the
picked
corps
of
the
estremaduran
army
and
as
the
remains
of
venegas
s
divisions
rallied
and
recruited
after
almonacid
amounted
to
rather
more
than
that
number
the
united
force
exceeded
sabres
and
bayonets
with
this
army
the
junta
intended
to
make
a
direct
stroke
at
madrid
while
albuquerque
was
directed
to
show
himself
on
the
tagus
in
front
of
almaraz
and
talavera
with
the
object
of
detaining
at
least
one
of
the
french
corps
in
that
direction
it
was
hoped
even
yet
that
wellington
might
be
induced
to
join
in
this
demonstration
if
once
the
redcoats
reappeared
at
the
front
neither
soult
nor
mortier
could
be
moved
to
oppose
the
army
of
la
mancha
meanwhile
ney
and
the
french
corps
in
leon
and
old
castile
were
to
be
distracted
by
the
use
of
a
new
force
from
the
north
whose
composition
must
be
explained
the
junta
held
that
the
last
campaign
had
failed
only
because
the
allies
had
possessed
no
force
ready
to
detain
soult
and
ney
if
they
had
not
appeared
at
plasencia
wellington
cuesta
and
venegas
would
have
been
able
to
drive
king
joseph
out
of
his
capital
two
months
later
the
whole
position
was
changed
in
their
estimation
by
the
fact
that
spain
once
more
possessed
a
large
army
of
the
left
which
would
be
able
to
occupy
at
least
two
french
corps
while
the
rest
of
the
allies
marched
again
on
madrid
that
such
a
force
existed
did
indeed
modify
the
aspect
of
affairs
la
romana
had
been
moved
to
seville
to
become
a
member
of
the
junta
but
his
successor
the
duke
del
parque
was
collecting
a
host
very
formidable
as
far
as
numbers
went
the
old
army
of
galicia
had
been
reformed
into
four
divisions
under
martin
de
la
carrera
losada
mahy
and
the
conde
de
belveder
the
general
whose
name
was
so
unfortunately
connected
with
the
combat
of
gamonal
these
four
divisions
now
comprised
men
of
whom
more
than
half
were
galician
recruits
whom
la
romana
had
embodied
in
the
depleted
cadres
of
his
original
battalions
after
ney
and
soult
had
evacuated
the
province
in
july
a
few
of
the
ancient
regiments
that
had
made
the
campaign
of
espinosa
had
died
out
completely
their
small
remnants
having
been
drafted
into
other
corps
on
the
other
hand
there
were
a
few
new
regiments
of
galician
volunteers
but
la
romana
had
set
his
face
against
the
creation
of
such
units
wisely
preferring
to
place
his
new
levies
in
the
ranks
of
the
old
battalions
of
the
regular
army
in
the
main
therefore
the
new
army
of
the
left
represented
as
far
as
names
and
cadres
went
blake
s
original
army
of
galicia
it
had
the
same
cardinal
fault
as
that
army
in
that
it
had
practically
no
cavalry
whatever
the
single
dragoon
regiment
that
blake
had
owned
la
reina
having
been
almost
completely
destroyed
in
each
division
had
a
battery
the
guns
of
which
la
romana
s
army
had
been
almost
destitute
in
the
spring
had
been
supplied
from
england
and
landed
at
corunna
during
the
summer
the
only
regiments
of
blake
s
original
army
that
seem
to
be
completely
dead
in
october
are
of
catalonia
naples
pontevedra
compostella
naples

been
drafted
into

no
some
small
fraction
of
it
reappeared
in
the
campaign
of
but
the
galician
divisions
though
the
most
numerous
were
not
the
only
units
which
were
told
off
to
the
new
army
of
the
asturias
had
been
free
of
invaders
since
ney
and
bonnet
retired
from
its
borders
in
june
the
central
junta
ordered
ballasteros
to
join
the
main
army
with
the
few
regular
troops
in
the
principality
and
ten
battalions
of
the
local
volunteers
a
force
of
over
men
the
asturian
junta
always
very
selfish
and
particularist
in
its
aims
made
some
protests
but
obeyed
nine
of
its
less
efficient
regiments
were
left
behind
to
watch
bonnet
finally
the
duke
del
parque
himself
had
been
collecting
fresh
levies
about
ciudad
rodrigo
while
the
plains
of
leon
lay
abandoned
by
the
french
during
the
absence
of
ney
s
corps
in
the
valley
of
the
tagus
including
the
garrison
of
rodrigo
he
had
men
all
in
new
units
save
one
old
line
battalion
and
one
old
militia
regiment
deducting
the
men
which
held
the
fortress
there
were
seven
battalions
nearly
bayonets
and
a
squadron
or
two
of
horse
available
for
the
strengthening
of
the
field
army
these
were
now
told
off
as
the
division
of
the
army
of
the
left
that
of
ballasteros
was
numbered
the
division
one
battalion
of
majorca
and
the
militia
battalion
of
segovia
the
galician
asturian
and
leonese
divisions
had
between
them
less
than
horsemen
to
make
up
for
this
destitution
the
central
junta
directed
the
duke
of
albuquerque
to
send
off
to
ciudad
rodrigo
via
the
portuguese
frontier
a
brigade
of
his
cavalry
accordingly
the
prince
of
anglona
marched
north
with
three
regiments
only
sabres
in
all
and
joined
del
parque
on
september
thus
at
the
end
of
that
month
the
army
of
the
left
numbered
nearly
men
all
infantry
save
horse
and
gunners
but
they
were
scattered
all
over
spain
from
oviedo
to
astorga
and
from
astorga
to
ciudad
rodrigo
and
had
to
be
concentrated
before
they
could
act
nor
was
the
concentration
devoid
of
danger
for
the
french
might
fall
upon
the
asturians
or
the
leonese
before
they
had
joined
the
galician
main
body
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
never
took
the
field
in
one
mass
for
del
parque
left
a
division
under
mahy
to
protect
galicia
and
when
these
regiments
and
the
garrison
of
rodrigo
were
deducted
he
had
but
in
all
including
sick
and
men
on
detachment
this
nevertheless
constituted
a
formidable
force
if
it
had
been
in
existence
in
july
soult
and
ney
could
never
have
marched
against
wellington
with
their
whole
strength
and
the
talavera
campaign
might
have
had
another
end
but
the
troops
were
of
varying
quality
the
leonese
division
was
absolutely
raw
the
galicians
had
far
too
many
recruits
with
only
two
months
training
in
their
ranks
the
estremaduran
cavalry
had
a
bad
record
of
disasters
a
general
of
genius
might
have
accomplished
something
with
the
army
of
the
left
but
del
parque
though
more
cautious
than
many
of
his
compeers
was
no
genius
borbon
sagunto
and
granaderos
de
llerena
sabres
in
october
these
regiments
had
newly
rejoined
the
estremaduran
army
from
the
rear
the
junta
had
a
notion
that
if
sufficient
pressure
were
applied
to
wellesley
and
wellington
they
would
permit
beresford
s
portuguese
army
now
some
strong
to
join
del
parque
for
the
advance
into
the
plains
of
leon
they
had
mistaken
their
men
wellington
returned
as
peremptory
a
refusal
to
their
request
for
the
aid
of
the
portuguese
troops
as
to
their
demand
that
his
own
british
army
should
advance
with
albuquerque
to
the
tagus
see
wellington
to
wellesley
from
badajoz
nothing
could
be
more
hazardous
than
the
plan
finally
formulated
at
the
seville
war
office
for
the
simultaneous
advance
of
the
armies
of
la
mancha
the
north
and
estremadura
even
if
it
had
been
energetically
supported
by
wellington
and
beresford
it
would
have
been
rash
converging
operations
by
several
armies
starting
from
distant
bases
against
an
enemy
concentrated
in
their
midst
are
proverbially
disastrous
in
this
particular
plan
three
forces
numbering
in
all
about
men
and
starting
from
points
so
far
apart
as
ciudad
rodrigo
truxillo
and
the
passes
by
la
carolina
were
to
fall
upon
some
men
placed
in
a
comparatively
compact
body
in
their
centre
a
single
mistake
in
the
timing
of
operations
the
chance
that
one
spanish
army
might
outmarch
another
or
that
one
of
the
three
might
fail
to
detain
any
hostile
force
in
its
front
as
had
happened
with
venegas
during
the
talavera
campaign
was
bound
to
be
ruinous
the
french
had
it
in
their
power
to
deal
with
their
enemies
in
detail
if
the
least
mischance
should
occur
and
with
spanish
generals
and
spanish
armies
it
was
almost
certain
that
some
error
would
be
made
meanwhile
the
junta
made
their
last
preparation
for
the
grand
stroke
by
deposing
venegas
from
the
command
of
the
united
army
in
la
mancha
eguia
held
the
interim
command
for
a
few
days
but
was
to
be
replaced
by
areizaga
an
elderly
general
who
had
never
commanded
more
than
a
single
division
and
had
to
his
credit
only
courage
shown
in
a
subordinate
position
at
the
battle
of
alcañiz
he
was
summoned
from
lerida
and
came
hastily
to
take
up
his
charge
the
sole
advantage
which
the
spaniards
possessed
in
october
was
that
their
enemy
did
not
expect
to
be
attacked
a
month
after
talavera
matters
had
apparently
settled
down
for
the
whole
autumn
as
far
as
the
french
generals
could
calculate
with
the
knowledge
that
the
austrian
war
was
over
and
that
unlimited
reinforcements
could
now
be
poured
into
spain
by
his
brother
king
joseph
was
content
to
wait
he
had
refused
to
allow
soult
to
make
his
favourite
move
of
invading
portugal
in
the
end
of
august
because
he
wished
the
emperor
to
take
up
the
responsibility
of
settling
the
next
plan
of
campaign
and
of
determining
the
number
of
new
troops
that
would
be
required
to
carry
it
out
the
french
corps
therefore
were
in
a
semicircle
round
madrid
soult
and
mortier
in
the
central
tagus
valley
at
plasencia
and
talavera
victor
in
la
mancha
with
sebastiani
supporting
him
at
toledo
and
aranjuez
ney
at
salamanca
dessolles
and
the
royal
guard
as
a
central
reserve
in
the
capital
this
was
a
purely
defensive
position
and
joseph
intended
to
retain
it
till
the
masses
of
troops
from
germany
with
the
emperor
himself
perchance
at
their
head
should
come
up
to
his
aid
it
does
not
seem
to
have
entered
into
his
head
that
the
enemy
would
again
take
the
offensive
after
the
fiasco
of
the
talavera
campaign
and
the
bloody
lesson
of
almonacid
in
september
and
the
early
days
of
october
the
french
hardly
moved
at
all
ney
left
his
corps
at
salamanca
and
went
on
a
short
leave
to
paris
on
september
so
little
was
any
danger
expected
in
the
plains
of
leon
the
charge
of
the
corps
was
handed
over
to
marchand
his
senior
divisional
general
there
was
an
even
more
important
change
of
command
pending
jourdan
had
been
soliciting
permission
to
return
to
france
ever
since
july
he
had
been
on
excellent
terms
with
king
joseph
but
found
it
hard
to
exact
obedience
from
the
marshals
indeed
he
was
generally
engaged
in
a
controversy
either
with
victor
or
with
soult
the
emperor
was
not
inclined
to
allow
him
to
quit
spain
but
jourdan
kept
sending
in
applications
to
be
superseded
backed
by
medical
certificates
as
to
his
dangerous
state
of
health
finally
he
was
granted
leave
to
return
by
a
letter
which
reached
him
on
october
just
as
the
new
campaign
was
beginning
to
develop
into
an
acute
phase
but
he
gladly
handed
over
his
duties
to
soult
who
thus
became
or
chief
of
the
staff
to
king
joseph
and
departed
without
lingering
or
reluctance
for
france
glad
to
be
quit
of
a
most
invidious
office
for
jourdan
s
personal
views
see
his
ed
grouchy
before
jourdan
s
departure
there
had
been
some
small
movements
of
the
french
troops
hearing
vague
rumours
of
the
passage
eastward
of
eguia
s
army
king
joseph
ordered
a
corresponding
shift
of
his
own
troops
towards
that
quarter
soult
and
the
corps
were
ordered
from
plasencia
to
oropesa
and
talavera
there
relieving
mortier
and
the
corps
who
were
to
push
up
the
tagus
toward
toledo
this
would
enable
victor
to
call
up
sebastiani
s
cavalry
and
two
of
his
infantry
divisions
from
toledo
into
la
mancha
having
thus
got
together
some
men
victor
advanced
to
daimiel
and
pressed
in
the
advanced
posts
of
the
main
spanish
army
on
october
eguia
who
was
still
in
temporary
command
since
areizaga
had
not
yet
arrived
made
no
attempt
to
stand
but
retired
into
the
passes
of
the
sierra
morena
this
apparent
timidity
of
the
enemy
convinced
the
marshal
that
nothing
dangerous
was
on
hand
in
this
quarter
he
drew
back
his
army
into
cantonments
in
a
semicircle
from
toledo
to
tarancon
leaving
the
cavalry
of
milhaud
and
paris
out
in
his
front
nothing
more
happened
in
la
mancha
for
a
fortnight
but
on
the
other
wing
in
the
kingdom
of
leon
matters
came
to
a
head
sooner
about
the
middle
of
september
the
bulk
of
the
galician
army
the
divisions
of
losada
belveder
and
la
carrera
had
moved
down
the
portuguese
frontier
via
alcanizas
and
joined
del
parque
at
ciudad
rodrigo
on
the
of
the
same
month
the
prince
of
anglona
with
the
cavalry
brigade
from
estremadura
also
came
in
to
unite
himself
to
the
army
of
the
left
del
parque
had
thus
infantry
and
horse
concentrated
he
had
still
to
be
joined
by
ballasteros
and
the
asturians
who
had
to
pick
their
way
with
caution
through
the
plains
of
leon
mahy
and
the
division
of
the
galicians
had
been
left
in
the
passes
above
astorga
to
cover
the
into
galicia
he
had
a
vanguard
in
astorga
under
santocildes
and
the
town
whose
walls
had
been
repaired
by
the
order
of
la
romana
was
now
capable
of
making
some
defence
facing
del
parque
and
his
lieutenants
there
were
two
distinct
forces
the
corps
now
under
marchand
was
concentrated
at
salamanca
having
received
few
or
no
drafts
since
its
return
from
galicia
it
was
rather
weak
its
battalions
and
four
cavalry
regiments
only
counted
at
the
end
of
september
some
bayonets
and
sabres
effective
the
sick
being
numerous
in
the
north
of
leon
and
in
old
castile
kellermann
was
in
charge
with
an
independent
force
of
no
great
strength
his
own
division
of
dragoons
nearly
sabres
was
its
only
formidable
unit
the
infantry
was
composed
of
three
swiss
battalions
and
four
or
five
french
battalions
which
had
been
left
in
garrisons
in
old
castile
when
the
regiments
to
which
they
belonged
went
southward
in
the
preceding
winter
the
whole
did
not
amount
to
more
than
bayonets
the
dragoons
were
very
serviceable
in
the
vast
plains
of
leon
but
it
was
with
difficulty
and
only
by
cutting
down
garrisons
to
a
dangerous
extent
that
kellermann
could
assemble
a
weak
infantry
brigade
of
men
to
back
the
horsemen
see
the
table
given
by
sprünglin
on
of
his
apparently
kellermann
had
at
this
moment
a
battalion
each
of
the
and
swiss
a
battalion
of
the
garde
de
paris
one
each
of
the
léger
and
line
and
one
or
two
of
the
it
was
nevertheless
on
kellermann
s
side
and
by
the
initiative
of
the
french
that
the
first
clash
took
place
in
spain
hearing
vague
reports
of
the
movement
of
the
galician
divisions
towards
ciudad
rodrigo
kellermann
sent
general
carrié
with
two
regiments
of
dragoons
and
infantry
to
occupy
astorga
being
ignorant
apparently
that
it
was
now
garrisoned
and
more
or
less
fortified
carrié
found
the
place
occupied
made
a
weak
attack
upon
it
on
october
and
was
beaten
off
he
was
able
to
report
to
his
chief
that
the
spaniards
mahy
s
division
were
in
some
force
in
the
passes
beyond
at
much
the
same
moment
that
this
fact
was
ascertained
del
parque
began
to
move
he
had
been
lying
since
september
at
fuente
guinaldo
in
the
highland
above
ciudad
rodrigo
on
october
he
made
an
advance
as
far
as
tamames
on
the
from
rodrigo
to
salamanca
which
skirts
the
mountains
wisely
avoiding
the
in
the
more
level
ground
by
san
martin
del
rio
and
castrejon
he
had
with
him
his
three
galician
divisions
and
his
horse
but
he
had
not
brought
forward
his
raw
leonese
division
under
castrofuerte
which
still
lay
by
rodrigo
on
hearing
of
the
duke
s
advance
marchand
sent
out
reconnaissances
and
having
discovered
the
position
of
the
spaniards
resolved
at
once
to
attack
them
on
october
he
started
out
from
salamanca
taking
with
him
his
whole
corps
except
the
two
battalions
of
the
regiment
which
were
left
to
garrison
the
town
on
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
marchand
came
in
sight
of
the
enemy
who
was
drawn
up
ready
to
receive
him
on
the
heights
above
tamames
the
french
general
had
with
him
nineteen
battalions
some
bayonets
his
horse
and
fourteen
guns
del
parque
had
galician
infantry
anglona
s
cavalry
and
eighteen
guns
his
position
was
so
strong
and
his
superiority
in
infantry
so
marked
that
he
was
probably
justified
in
risking
a
battle
on
the
defensive
tamames
an
unwalled
village
of
moderate
size
lies
at
the
foot
of
a
range
of
swelling
hills
its
strategical
importance
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
is
the
of
the
two
country
roads
from
ciudad
rodrigo
to
salamanca
matilla
and
from
ciudad
rodrigo
to
bejar
and
the
pass
of
baños
nava
redonda
placed
there
del
parque
s
army
threatened
salamanca
and
had
a
choice
of
lines
of
retreat
the
roads
to
rodrigo
and
to
the
passes
into
estremadura
being
both
open
but
retreat
was
not
the
duke
s
intention
he
had
drawn
up
his
army
on
the
heights
above
tamames
occupying
the
village
below
with
a
battalion
or
two
on
the
right
where
the
hillside
was
steeper
he
had
placed
losada
and
the
division
on
the
left
where
the
ridge
sinks
down
gently
into
the
plain
was
martin
de
la
carrera
with
the
vanguard
division
the
conde
de
belveder
s
division
the
third
formed
the
reserve
and
was
drawn
up
on
the
reverse
slope
behind
la
carrera
the
prince
of
anglona
s
cavalry
brigade
was
out
on
the
extreme
left
partly
hidden
by
woods
in
the
low
ground
beyond
the
flank
of
the
vanguard
marchand
arriving
on
the
ground
in
the
afternoon
after
a
march
of
fourteen
miles
from
matilla
was
overjoyed
to
see
the
enemy
offering
battle
and
attacked
without
a
moment
s
hesitation
his
arrangements
much
resembled
those
of
victor
at
ucles
though
his
luck
was
to
be
very
different
it
was
clear
that
the
spanish
left
was
the
weak
point
and
that
the
heights
could
be
turned
and
ascended
on
that
side
with
ease
accordingly
maucune
s
brigade
six
battalions
in
all
and
the
light
cavalry
strengthened
by
one
regiment
of
dragoons
were
ordered
to
march
off
to
the
right
to
form
in
a
line
perpendicular
to
that
of
del
parque
and
break
down
his
flank
when
this
movement
was
well
developed
marcognet
s
brigade
six
battalions
was
to
attack
the
spanish
centre
to
the
east
of
the
village
of
tamames
while
the
léger
two
battalions
was
to
contain
the
hostile
right
by
a
demonstration
against
the
high
and
difficult
ground
in
that
direction
marchand
kept
in
reserve
behind
his
centre
the
and
of
the
line
six
battalions
and
his
remaining
regiment
of
dragoons
the
vice
of
this
formation
was
that
the
striking
force
maucune
s
column
was
too
weak
it
would
have
been
wise
to
have
strengthened
it
at
the
expense
of
the
centre
and
to
have
made
a
mere
demonstration
against
the
heights
above
the
village
of
tamames
as
well
as
on
the
extreme
french
left

two

of

maucune
accomplished
his

march
undisturbed
deployed
in
front
of
la
carrera
s
left
and
advanced
against
it
the
spanish
general
threw
back
his
wing
to
protect
himself
and
ordered
his
cavalry
to
threaten
the
flank
of
the
advancing
force
but
he
was
nearly
swept
away
when
the
skirmishing
lines
were
in
contact
the
french
brigadier
ordered
his
cavalry
to
charge
the
centre
of
the
spanish
division
striking
in
diagonally
lorcet
s
hussars
and
chasseurs
broke
la
carrera
s
line
and
captured
the
six
guns
of
his
divisional
artillery
almost
at
the
same
moment
anglona
s
cavalry
came
in
upon
maucune
s
flank
but
being
opposed
by
two
battalions
of
the
in
square
they
received
but
one
fire
and
fled
hastily
to
the
rear
maucune
then
resumed
his
march
up
the
hill
covering
his
flank
with
his
horsemen
and
pushing
la
carrera
s
broken
line
before
him
but
at
the
head
of
the
slope
he
met
belveder
s
reserve
which
let
the
broken
troops
pass
through
their
intervals
and
took
up
the
fight
steadily
enough
the
french
were
now
opposed
by
triple
numbers
and
the
combat
came
to
a
standstill
maucune
s
offensive
power
was
exhausted
and
he
could
no
longer
use
his
cavalry
on
the
steep
ground
which
he
had
reached
illustration
battle
of
tamames
meanwhile
on
seeing
their
right
brigade
opening
the
combat
with
such
success
the
two
other
french
columns
went
forward
marcognet
against
the
spanish
centre
anselme
of
the
léger
against
the
extreme
right
but
the
ground
was
here
much
steeper
losada
s
galician
division
stood
its
ground
very
steadily
and
marcognet
s
two
regiments
made
an
involuntary
halt
of
the
way
up
the
heights
under
the
full
fire
of
the
two
spanish
batteries
there
placed
and
the
long
line
of
infantry
the
officers
made
several
desperate
attempts
to
induce
the
columns
to
resume
their
advance
but
to
no
effect
they
fell
in
great
numbers
and
at
last
the
regiments
recoiled
and
descended
the
hill
in
disorder
losada
s
battalions
pursued
them
to
the
foot
of

slope
and
the
spanish
light
troops
in
the
village
sallied
out
upon
their
flank
and
completed
their
rout
marcognet

brigade
poured
down
into
the
plain
as
a
disordered
mass
of
fugitives
and
were
only
stayed

brought
up

to
their
rescue
del

wisely
halted
the
pursuing
force
before
it
came
into
contact
with
the
french
reserves
and
took
up
again
his
post
on
the
heights
meanwhile
the
léger
on
the
extreme
french
right
had
not
pressed
its
attack
home
and
retreated
when
the
central
advance
was
repulsed
maucune
too
seeing
the
rout
to
his
left
withdrew
from
the
heights
under
cover
of
his
cavalry
carrying
off
only
one
of
the
spanish
guns
that
he
had
taken
early
in
the
fight
and
leaving
in
return
a
disabled
piece
of
his
own
on
the
hill
the
battle
was
fairly
lost
and
marchand
retired
under
cover
of
his
cavalry
along
the
salamanca
road
the
enemy
made
no
serious
attempt
to
pursue
him
in
the
plain
where
his
horsemen
would
have
been
able
to
act
with
advantage
the
french
had
lost
or
men
including
officers
killed
and
a
general
lorcet
and
officers
wounded
marcognet
s
brigade
supplied
the
greater
part
of
the
casualties
the
lost
its
eagle
seven
officers
killed
and
fifteen
wounded
the
almost
as
many
the
cavalry
and
maucune
s
brigade
suffered
little
the
very
moderate
spanish
loss
was
killed
and
wounded
mostly
in
la
carrera
s
division
marchand
in
his
dispatch
says
men
in
all
were
lost
and
a
gun
he
makes
no
mention
of
the
eagle
his
sprünglin
who
has
a
good
account
of
the
battle
in
his
pp
gives
the
total
of
the
spaniards
exaggerated
the
loss
to
this
was
the
first
general
action
since
baylen
in
which
the
spaniards
gained
a
complete
victory
they
had
a
superiority
of
about
seven
to
four
in
numbers
and
a
good
position
nevertheless
the
troops
were
so
raw
and
the
past
record
of
the
army
of
the
left
was
so
disheartening
that
the
victory
reflects
considerable
credit
on
the
galicians
the
corps
was
reckoned
the
best
of
all
the
french
units
in
spain
being
entirely
composed
of
old
regiments
from
the
army
of
germany
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
ney
s
absence
was
responsible
for
the
defeat
of
his
men
marchand
attacked
at
three
points
and
was
weak
at
each
the
marshal
would
certainly
have
massed
a
whole
division
against
the
spanish
left
and
would
not
have
been
stopped
by
the
stout
resistance
made
by
belveder
s
reserve
a
demonstration
by
a
few
battalions
would
have
contained
losada
s
troops
on
the
left
where
the
ground
was
too
unfavourable
for
a
serious
attack
la
perte
de
cette
affaire
fut
entièrement
due
à
la
faute
que
fit
le
général
marchand
de
multiplier
ses
attaques
et
de
s
engager
par
petits
paquets
tout
le
monde
se
mêlait
de
donner
son
avis
et
on
remarquait
l
absence
de
le
maréchal
says
sprünglin
in
of
his
on
the
of
october
the
beaten
army
reached
salamanca
by
a
forced
march
marchand
feared
that
the
enemy
would
now
manœuvre
either
by
ledesma
so
as
to
cut
him
off
from
kellermann
and
the
troops
in
the
north
or
by
alba
de
tormes
so
as
to
intercept
his
communication
with
madrid
in
either
case
he
would
have
to
retreat
for
there
was
no
good
defensive
ground
on
the
tormes
to
resist
an
army
coming
from
the
west
as
a
matter
of
fact
del
parque
moved
by
ledesma
for
two
reasons
the
first
was
that
he
wished
to
avoid
the
plains
fearing
that
kellermann
might
have
joined
the
corps
with
his
cavalry
division
the
second
was
that
by
moving
in
this
direction
he
hoped
to
make
his
junction
with
ballasteros
who
had
started
from
the
asturias
to
join
him
and
had
been
reported
to
have
moved
from
astorga
to
miranda
del
duero
and
to
be
feeling
his
way
the
juncture
took
place
the
asturian
division
after
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
cut
off
the
garrison
of
zamora
on
the
seventeenth
had
marched
to
ledesma
and
met
the
main
army
there
del
parque
had
now
men
and
though
still
very
weak
in
cavalry
thought
himself
strong
enough
to
march
on
salamanca
he
reached
it
on
october
and
found
it
evacuated
marchand
learning
that
kellermann
was
too
far
off
to
help
him
and
knowing
that
no
reinforcements
from
madrid
could
reach
him
for
many
days
had
evacuated
the
town
on
the
previous
evening
he
retired
towards
toro
thus
throwing
up
his
communications
with
madrid
in
order
to
make
sure
of
joining
kellermann
this
seems
doubtful
policy
for
that
general
could
only
aid
him
with
or
men
and
their
joint
force
would
be
under
strong
on
the
other
hand
by
retiring
on
peñaranda
or
medina
de
campo
and
so
approaching
the
king
s
army
he
could
have
counted
on
picking
up
much
larger
reinforcements
and
on
resuming
the
struggle
with
a
good
prospect
of
success
as
a
matter
of
fact
jourdan
on
hearing
of
the
disaster
of
tamames
had
dispatched
to
aid
the
corps
godinot
s
brigade
of
dessolles
division
some
bayonets
from
madrid
and
heudelet
s
division
of
the
corps
about
strong
from
oropesa
as
well
as
a
couple
of
regiments
of
cavalry
he
made
these
detachments
without
scruple
because
there
was
as
yet
no
sign
of
any
activity
on
the
part
of
the
spanish
armies
of
la
mancha
and
estremadura
a
week
later
he
would
have
found
it
much
more
hazardous
to
weaken
his
front
in
the
valley
of
the
tagus
these
were
the
last
orders
issued
by
jourdan
who
resigned
his
post
on
october
while
soult
on
november
arrived
at
madrid
and
replaced
him
as
chief
of
the
staff
to
king
joseph
del
parque
not
unnaturally
elated
by
his
victory
now
nourished
ambitious
ideas
of
clearing
the
whole
of
leon
and
old
castile
of
the
enemy
being
aware
that
the
armies
of
la
mancha
and
estremadura
ought
now
to
be
on
the
move
and
that
full
occupation
would
be
found
ere
long
for
the
french
corps
in
the
valley
of
the
tagus
he
ordered
up
his
division
the
raw
leonese
battalions
of
castrofuerte
from
ciudad
rodrigo
and
made
vehement
appeals
to
the
portuguese
government
to
lend
him
the
whole
of
beresford
s
army
for
a
great
advance
up
the
douro
the
regency
though
much
pressed
by
the
spanish
ambassador
at
lisbon
gave
a
blank
refusal
following
wellington
s
advice
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
offensive
operations
in
spanish
company
but
part
of
beresford
s
troops
were
ordered
up
to
the
frontier
not
so
much
to
lend
a
moral
support
to
del
parque
s
advance
as
to
be
ready
to
defend
their
own
borders
in
the
event
of
his
defeat
showing
more
prudence
than
wellington
had
expected
del
parque
did
not
push
forward
from
salamanca
when
he
became
certain
that
he
would
have
to
depend
on
his
own
forces
alone
even
after
the
arrival
of
his
reserves
from
rodrigo
he
remained
quiet
only
pushing
out
reconnaissances
to
discover
which
way
the
enemy
had
gone
he
had
in
fact
carried
out
his
part
in
the
central
junta
s
plan
of
campaign
by
calling
the
attention
of
the
french
to
the
north
and
distracting
troops
thither
from
the
king
s
army
it
was
now
the
time
for
albuquerque
and
areizaga
to
take
up
the
game
and
relieve
him
marchand
meanwhile
had
retired
across
the
douro
and
taken
up
an
extended
line
behind
it
from
zamora
to
tordesillas
a
front
of
over
forty
miles
which
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
hold
with
his
men
against
a
heavy
attack
delivered
at
one
point
but
he
was
hardly
in
position
when
kellermann
arrived
took
over
the
command
and
changed
the
whole
plan
of
campaign
november
he
had
left
two
battalions
to
guard
benavente
two
to
hold
valladolid
and
had
only
brought
up
his
dragoons
and
infantry
seeing
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
recover
the
line
of
communication
with
madrid
he
ordered
the
corps
to
leave
zamora
and
toro
mass
at
tordesillas
and
then
cross
the
douro
to
medina
del
campo
the
junction
point
of

to

he
brought
up
his
own
small
force
and
having
received
godinot
s
brigade
from

had
battalions
and
eighteen
squadrons
concentrated
about
men
though
not
yet
joined
by
the
other
troops
from

he
now
marched
straight
upon

columns

by
cantalapiedra
the
other
by

intending
to
offer
battle

end

badajoz
and
cf

to
forjaz
ibid
wellington
to
beresford
but
the
duke
much
to
the
surprise
of
every
one
utterly
refused
to
fight
holding
the
plain
too
dangerous
for
an
army
so
weak
in
cavalry
as
his
own
and
the
enemy
s
force
at
men
he
retired
from
salamanca
after
having
held
it
less
than
a
fortnight
on
november
and
took
not
the
road
to
ciudad
rodrigo
but
that
to
bejar
and
the
pass
of
baños
as
if
he
were
about
to
pass
the
mountains
into
estremadura
this
was
an
excellent
move
the
french
could
not
pursue
him
in
force
without
evacuating
old
castile
and
leon
which
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
them
to
contemplate
for
when
kellermann
had
concentrated
his
troops
to
strike
at
salamanca
there
was
nothing
left
behind
him
in
the
vast
upland
save
a
battalion
or
two
at
benavente
valladolid
and
burgos
mahy
from
galicia
and
the
asturians
might
have
overrun
the
whole
region
unopposed
as
it
was
the
whole
of
the
provinces
behind
the
douro

signs
of
bursting
out
into

names
were

to
be

down

the
french
governors
on
every
side
kept
reporting
their
perilous
position
when
they
could
get
a
message
through
to
madrid
he
sent
this
estimate
to
wellington
see
the
latter
to
beresford
badajoz
the
junta
afterwards
contemplated
bringing
him
down
to
join
albuquerque
via
plasencia
which
was
free
of
french
troops
since
soult
had
moved
to
oropesa
but
this
does
not
seem
to
have
been
thought
of
so
early
as
see
soult
to
clarke
from
madrid
for
these
movements
realizing
that
he
must
cover
his
rear
or
the
whole
of
old
castile
would
be
lost
to
the
insurgents
kellermann
after
occupying
salamanca
on
november
left
the
corps
and
godinot
s
brigade
distributed
between
ledesma
salamanca
and
alba
de
tormes
watching
del
parque
and
returned
in
haste
with
his
own
troops
to
the
douro
he
commenced
to
send
out
flying
columns
from
valladolid
to
deal
with
the
guerrilleros
but
did
not
work
too
far
afield
lest
he
might
be
called
back
by
a
new
forward
movement
on
the
part
of
the
army
of
the
left
but
in
a
few
days
he
had
to
recast
all
his
arrangements
for
as
del
parque
had
calculated
the
campaign
in
la
mancha
had
just
opened
and
the
position
of
the
french
in
leon
and
old
castile
was
profoundly
affected
by
the
new
developments
in
the
south
as
we
have
already
explained
the
junta
designed
albuquerque
s
army
of
estremadura
to
be
a
mere
demonstrating
force
while
areizaga
s
men
were
to
strike
the
real
blow
the
estremaduran
troops
as
was
proper
moved
early
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
enemy
albuquerque
s
first
division
under
bassecourt
infantry
and
horse
was
on
the
tagus
from
almaraz
to
meza
de
ibor
his
second
division
under
juan
and
the
rest
of
his
cavalry
some
in
all
were
moving
up
from
truxillo
bassecourt
began
by
sending
a
small
force
of
all
arms
across
the
river
at
almaraz
to
drive
in
soult
s
outposts
and
spread
reports
abroad
in
all
directions
that
he
was
acting
as
the
vanguard
to
wellington
s
army
which
was
marching
up
from
badajoz
unfortunately
the
full
effect
that
he
desired
was
not
produced
because
deserters
informed
soult
that
the
british
army
was
still
quiescent
on
the
guadiana
the
french
made
no
movement
and
left
the
corps
alone
to
watch
albuquerque
soult
to
clarke
from
madrid
the
deserters
were
a
body
of
men
of
the
walloon
guards
who
had
enlisted
from
dupont
s
prisoners
in
order
to
get
a
chance
of
escaping
they
reached
oropesa
on
meanwhile
areizaga
within
a
few
days
of
assuming
the
command
of
the
army
of
la
mancha
commenced
his
forward
movement
on
november
having
concentrated
his
eight
divisions
of
infantry
and
his
horse
at
santa
cruz
de
mudela
at
the
foot
of
the
passes
he
gave
the
order
to
advance
into
the
plains
the
head
quarters
followed
the
with
the
train
and
three
divisions
the
rest
to
avoid
encumbering
the
marched
by
parallel
but
were
never
more
than
ten
miles
from
their
at
any
rate
areizaga
avoided
the
sin
of
dispersion
his
army
was
the
best
which
had
been
seen
under
the
spanish
banners
since
tudela
the
men
had
all
been
furnished
with
new
clothes
and
equipment
since
august
mainly
from
english
stores
landed
at
cadiz
there
were
sixty
guns
and
such
a
body
of
cavalry
as
had
never
yet
been
collected
during
the
war
the
value
of
the
troops
was
very
unequal
if
there
were
many
old
battalions
of
the
regular
army
there
were
also
many
new
units
composed
of
andalusian
levies
the
cavalry
included
the
old
runaways
of
medellin
and
many
other
regiments
of
doubtful
value
the
morale
was
on
the
whole
not
satisfactory
i
wish
i
had
anything
agreeable
to
communicate
to
you
from
this
army
wrote
colonel
roche
a
british
officer
attached
to
areizaga
s
staff
to
wellington
the
corps
which
belonged
to
the
original
army
of
la
mancha
are
certainly
in
every
respect
superior
to
those
from
estremadura
and
from
everything
that
i
can
learn
none
of
those
abuses
which
were
to
be
lamented
in
the
army
of
estremadura
existed
here
or
at
least
in
a
much
less
degree
but
nothing
can
exceed
the
general
discontent
dissatisfaction
and
demoralization
of
the
mass
of
the
people
and
of
the
army
how
can
anybody
who
has
the
faculty
of
reason
separate
the
inefficiency
intrigue
bad
organization
and
consequent
disasters
of
the
army
from
the
source
of
all
those
evils
in
the
junta
there
is
not
a
man
of
the
least
reflection
who
as
things
now
stand
has
a
hope
of
success
and
this
is
the
more
melancholy
because
the
mass
of
the
people
are
just
as
inveterate
in
their
resentment
and
abhorrence
of
the
french
as
at
the
first
hour
of
the
revolution
the
fact
seems
to
have
been
that
the
superior
officers
doubted
the
wisdom
of
taking
the
offensive
according
to
the
junta
s
orders
and
had
no
confidence
in
areizaga
who
was
only
known
as
a
fighting
general
and
had
no
reputation
for
skill
the
rank
and
file
as
arteche
remarks
were
disposed
to
do
their
duty
but
had
no
confidence
in
their
luck
their
government
and
not
their
generals
must
take
the
major
part
of
the
blame
for
the
disaster
that
followed
roche
to
wellington
from
santa
cruz
de
la
mudela
supplementary

the

areizaga
was
well
aware
that
his
best
chance
was
to
strike
with
extreme
boldness
and
vigour
and
to
dash
into
the
midst
of
the
french
before
they
could
concentrate
hence
his
march
was
at
first
conducted
with
great
rapidity
and
decision
between
the
and
the
of
november
he
made
nearly
fifteen
miles
a
day
though
the
roads
were
somewhat
broken
up
by
the
autumn
rains
on
the
eighth
he
reached
la
guardia
eighty
miles
from
his
and
his
advanced
cavalry
under
general
freire
had
its
first
skirmish
with
a
brigade
of
milhaud
s
dragoons
at
costa
de
madera
near
dos
barrios
the
spanish
horse
deployed
in
such
numbers
that
the
french
were
compelled
to
move
off
in
haste
and
with
some
loss
though
they
had
beaten
off
with
ease
the
first
two
or
three
regiments
which
had
gone
forward
against
them
the
spanish
advance
had
been
so
rapid
and
so
unexpected
that
soult
and
king
joseph
had
been
taken
completely
by
surprise
on
november
the
marshal
had
reported
to
paris
that
the
troops
on
the
tagus
and
in
la
mancha
are
up
to
the
present
unmolested
and
as
from
all
i
can
learn
there
is
no
prospect
of
the
enemy
making
any
offensive
movement
on
that
side
i
intend
to
form
from
them
a
strong
flying
column
to
hunt
the
brigands
in
the
direction
of
burgos
only
four
days
later
he
had
to
announce
that
an
army
of
at
least
men
was
close
in
front
of
aranjuez
and
not
more
than
miles
from
madrid
and
that
he
was
hurrying
together
troops
from
all
quarters
to
make
head
against
them
at
the
moment
indeed
there
was
nothing
directly
between
areizaga
s
vanguard
at
la
guardia
and
the
spanish
capital
save
the
polish
division
of
the
corps
stationed
at
aranjuez
and
milhaud
s
five
regiments
of
dragoons
at
ocaña
if
the
spaniard
had
pushed
on
for
three
days
more
at
his
starting
pace
he
might
have
crossed
the
tagus
and
have
forced
king
joseph
to
fight
close
in
front
of
madrid
with
an
imperfectly
assembled
army
on
the
ninth
and
tenth
leval
s
germans
were
in
march
from
toledo
to
aranjuez
to
join
sebastiani
s
poles
mortier
s
first
division
was
hurrying
from
talavera
to
toledo
and
his
second
division
was
making
ready
to
follow
the
corps
despite
albuquerque
s
demonstration
in
front
of
almaraz
was
preparing
to
quit
oropesa
in
order
to
replace
mortier
s
men
at
talavera
victor
in
the
meanwhile
with
the
first
corps
was
lying
in
front
of
toledo
at
ajofrin
with
his
cavalry
at
mora
and
yebenes
he
reported
that
no
hostile
force
had
come
his
way
but
that
he
had
ascertained
that
a
large
army
had
marched
past
his
front
along
the
great
from
madridejos
to
aranjuez
he
was
in
a
position
to
attack
it
in
rear
and
flank
if
there
was
a
sufficient
force
gathered
in
its
front
to
justify
him
in
closing
soult
to
clarke
madrid
soult
to
clarke
madrid
but
on
reaching
la
guardia
areizaga
seemed
suddenly
to
realize
the
dangers
of
his
movement
no
doubt
it
was
the
news
that
victor
was
almost
in
his
rear
that
paralysed
him
but
he
halted
on
the
ninth
when
a
bold
advance
would
certainly
have
enabled
him
to
seize
aranjuez
by
evicting
the
small
force
under
milhaud
and
sebastiani
for
three
fatal
days
the
and
of
november
the
spanish
main
body
remained
halted
in
a
mass
at
la
guardia
as
if
for
the
special
purpose
of
allowing
the
enemy
to
concentrate
on
the
eleventh
areizaga
at
last
began
to
move
again
he
sent
forward
the
whole
of
his
cavalry
supported
by
zayas
and
his
vanguard
division
to
press
back
the
force
in
his
front
they
found
milhaud
s
five
regiments
of
dragoons
ranged
in
line
of
battle
before
the
small
town
of
ocaña
and
supported
by
sebastiani
s
polish
infantry
freire
advanced
using
his
triple
superiority
of
numbers
to
turn
both
flanks
of
the
french
cavalry
milhaud
after
some
partial
charges
retired
behind
the
poles
who
formed
a
line
of
six
battalion
squares
the
spanish
horse
made
a
attempt
to
attack
them
but
were
repelled
by
their
rolling
fire
before
they
came
to
close
quarters
and
drew
back
it
was
now
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
and
the
spanish
infantry
was
only
just
beginning
to
come
up
zayas
and
freire
agreed
that
it
was
too
late
to
begin
a
second
attack
and
put
off
fighting
till
the
next
morning
but
during
the
night
the
french
evacuated
ocaña
and
retired
to
aranjuez
wisely
judging
that
it
would
be
insane
to
wait
for
the
arrival
of
the
spanish
main
body
they
had
lost
about
fifty
men
freire
s
cavalry
just
over
two
hundred
next
day
november
areizaga
brought
up
the
whole
of
his
army
to
ocaña
and
his
cavalry
reconnoitred
up
to
the
gates
of
aranjuez
and
the
bridge
of
puente
la
reyna
sebastiani
made
ready
to
defend
them
and
having
been
joined
by
the
german
division
from
toledo
wrote
to
soult
to
say
that
he
would
resist
to
the
last
extremity
in
order
to
gain
time
for
the
arrival
of
victor
s
corps
and
the
other
troops
which
were
marching
up
from
the
west
and
north
the
attack
which
he
expected
was
never
delivered
areizaga
nervous
about
the
presence
of
the
corps
on
his
flank
had
resolved
to
shift
his
army
eastward
to
get
further
away
from
it
abandoning
his
line
of
communication
by
la
guardia
and
madridejos
he
marched
his
whole
force
by
parallel
to
the
tagus
up
to
la
zarza
and
seized
the
fords
of
villamanrique
miles
above
aranjuez
on
the
road
if
victor
as
he
supposed
had
been
manœuvring
on
his
flank
this
movement
would
have
cut
him
off
from
his
base
in
andalusia
and
have
left
him
only
the
mountains
of
murcia
as
a
line
of
retreat
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
corps
was
no
longer
at
ajofrin
or
mora
but
had
been
called
behind
the
tagus
so
that
his
retreat
was
safer
than
he
supposed
sebastiani
to
soult
night
of
the
from
aranjuez
soult
and
king
joseph
meanwhile
had
been
completing
their
concentration
they
had
written
to
kellermann
ordering
him
to
send
back
to
madrid
without
delay
the
brigade
of
dessolles
division
under
godinot
which
had
been
lent
him
and
to
spare
them
as
well
one
infantry
brigade
of
the
corps
these
troops
were
too
far
off
to
be
available
at
once
but
of
the
remainder
of
their
units
the
royal
guard
and
spanish
battalions
of
king
joseph
with
dessolles
remaining
brigade
were
moved
out
to
support
sebastiani
victor
had
been
brought
back
across
the
tagus
and
was
also
marching
on
aranjuez
mortier
s
corps
was
concentrated
at
toledo
while
the
corps
was
in
motion
from
oropesa
to
talavera
having
discovered
no
signs
of
a
serious
advance
on
the
part
of
albuquerque
the
care
of
madrid
was
handed
over
to
the
incomplete
french
division
of
the
corps
some
of
whose
battalions
were
dispersed
at
guadalajara
alcala
segovia
and
other
garrisons
paris
s
light
cavalry
of
the
same
corps
was
also
at
this
moment
watching
the
roads
to
the
east
of
madrid
it
had
still
no
divisional
general
and
was
officially
known
by
the
name
of
sebastiani
s
division
regiments
on
the
twelfth
areizaga
threw
lacy
s
division
across
the
tagus
and
laid
down
two
pontoon
bridges
near
villamanrique
so
as
to
be
able
to
bring
over
his
whole
army
in
the
shortest
possible
time
but
the
thirteenth
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
were
days
of
storm
the
river
rose
high
and
the
artillery
and
train
stuck
fast
on
the
vile
from
ocaña
over
which
they
were
being
brought
in
consequence
less
than
half
the
spanish
army
was
north
of
the
tagus
on
november
though
the
advance
cavalry
pushed
on
to
the
line
of
the
tajuna
and
skirmished
with
paris
s
about
arganda
it
seemed
nevertheless
that
areizaga
was
committed
to
an
advance
upon
madrid
by
the
from
albacete
wherefore
soult
blew
up
the
bridges
of
aranjuez
and
puente
la
reyna
and
ordered
victor
to
march
from
aranjuez
on
arganda
with
the
corps
nearly
men
purposing
to
join
him
with
the
king
s
reserves
and
to
offer
battle
on
the
tajuna
while
mortier
and
sebastiani
s
poles
and
germans
should
fall
upon
the
enemy
s
flank
but
this
plan
was
foiled
by
a
new
move
upon
areizaga
s
part
he
now
commenced
a
retreat
as
objectless
as
his
late
advance
just
as
victor
s
cavalry
came
in
touch
with
his
front
he
withdrew
his
whole
army
across
the
tagus
destroyed
his
bridges
and
retired
to
la
zarza
on
the
seventeenth
evidently
with
the
intention
of
recovering
his
old
line
of
communication
with
andalusia
via
ocaña
and
madridejos
the
moment
that
this
new
departure
became
evident
soult
reversed
the
marching
orders
of
all
his
columns
save
victor
s
and
bade
them
return
hastily
to
aranjuez
where
the
bridge
was
repaired
in
haste
and
to
cross
the
tagus
there
with
the
intention
of
intercepting
areizaga
s
line
of
retreat
and
forcing
a
battle
on
him
near
ocaña
victor
however
had
got
so
far
to
the
east
that
it
would
have
wasted
time
to
bring
him
back
to
aranjuez
wherefore
he
was
directed
to
cross
the
river
at
villamanrique
and
follow
hard
in
areizaga
s
rear
on
the
morning
of
the
eighteenth
milhaud
s
and
paris
s
cavalry
riding
at
the
head
of
the
french
army
crossed
the
tagus
at
aranjuez
and
pressing
forward
met
between
ontigola
and
ocaña
freire
s
horsemen
moving
at
the
head
of
areizaga
s
column
which
on
this
day
was
strung
out
between
la
zarza
and
noblejas
marching
hastily
westward
towards
the
the
collision
of
milhaud
and
freire
brought
about
the
largest
cavalry
fight
which
took
place
during
the
whole
peninsular
war
for
milhaud
and
paris
had
eight
regiments
nearly
men
while
three
of
freire
s
four
divisions
were
present
to
the
number
of
over
sabres
on
neither
side
was
any
infantry
in
hand
sebastiani
who
had
come
up
with
the
light
cavalry
of
his
corps
was
eager
for
a
fight
and
engaged
at
once
charging
the
spanish
front
line
with
paris
s
light
horse
he
broke
it
with
ease
but
freire
came
on
with
his
reserves
forming
the
greater
part
of
them
into
a
solid
column
an
odd
formation
for
cavalry
into
this
mass
milhaud
charged
with
four
regiments
of
dragoons
the
heaviness
of
their
formation
did
not
suffice
to
enable
the
spaniards
to
stand
they
broke
when
attacked
and
went
to
the
rear
in
disorder
leaving
behind
them
eighty
prisoners
and
some
hundreds
of
killed
and
wounded
the
french
lost
only
a
few
scores
but
among
them
was
paris
the
not
unworthy
successor
of
the
adventurous
lasalle
in
command
of
the
light
cavalry
division
attached
to
the
corps
moving
forward
in
pursuit
of
the
routed
squadrons
sebastiani
approached
ocaña
but
halted
on
discovering
that
there
was
already
spanish
infantry
in
the
town
the
head
of
areizaga
s
long
column
had
reached
it
while
the
cavalry
combat
was
in
progress
the
rest
was
visible
slowly
moving
up
by
from
the
east
soult
was
at
once
apprised
that
the
enemy
s
army
was
close
in
his
front
so
close
that
it
could
not
get
away
without
fighting
for
its
train
and
rearguard
were
still
far
behind
and
would
be
cut
off
if
the
main
body
moved
on
without
making
a
stand
areizaga
though
he
had
shown
such
timidity
when
faced
by
sebastiani
s
men
at
aranjuez
and
by
victor
s
on
the
tajuna
now
offered
battle
to
the
much
more
formidable
force
which
soult
was
bringing
up
he
was
indeed
compelled
to
fight
partly
because
his
men
were
too
weary
to
move
forward
that
night
partly
because
he
wished
to
give
time
for
his
train
to
arrive
and
get
on
to
the
on
the
morning
of
the
nineteenth
his
army
was
discovered
drawn
up
in
two
lines
on
each
side
of
the
town
of
ocaña
there
were
still
some
infantry
and
cavalry
under
arms
despite
of
the
losses
of
the
late
week
the
oncoming
french
army
was
smaller
though
it
mustered
horse
it
had
only
foot
the
germans
and
poles
of
sebastiani
mortier
with
nearly
the
whole
of
the
corps
a
brigade
of
dessolles
division
the
king
s
guards
and
the
cavalry
of
milhaud
paris
and
beauregard
victor
was
too
far
off
to
be
available
having
found
the
flooded
tagus
hard
to
cross
he
was
on
this
day
barely
in
touch
with
the
extreme
rearguard
of
areizaga
s
army
which
was
escorting
the
train
being
nearly
twenty
miles
from
ocaña
he
could
not
hope
to
arrive
in
time
for
the
general
action
if
it
was
to
be
delivered
next
morn
if
areizaga
stood
firm
for
another
day
victor
would
be
pressing
him
from
the
flank
and
rear
while
the
main
army
was
in
his
front
but
it
was
highly
probable
that
areizaga
would
not
stand
but
would
retreat
at
night
all
his
previous
conduct
argued
a
great
disinclination
to
risk
a
battle
wherefore
soult
and
the
king
after
a
short
discussion
agreed
to
attack
at
once
despite
their
great
numerical
inferiority
in
the
open
plain
of
la
mancha
a
difference
of
or
infantry
was
not
enough
to
outweigh
the
superior
quality
and
training
of
the
french
army
colborne
in
a
letter
dated
december
says
we
had
infantry
and
nearly
cavalry
drawn
out
in
a
very
bad

joseph
declared
that
he
urged

when
soult
advised
waiting
for
victor
see
his
letter
in
vol
vii
of
ducasse
s
and
correspondence
of
joseph
there
is
so
to
speak
no
position
whatever
at
ocaña
the
little
unwalled
town
lies
in
a
level
upland
where
the
only
natural
feature
is
a
ravine
which
passes
in
front
of
the
place
it
is
sufficiently
deep
and
broad
at
its
western
end
to
constitute
a
military
obstacle
but
east
of
the
town
gradually
grows
slighter
and
becomes
a
mere
dip
in
the
ground
areizaga
had
chosen
this
ravine
to
indicate
the
line
of
his
left
and
centre
but
on
his
right
where
it
had
become
so
shallow
as
to
afford
no
cover
he
extended
his
troops
across
and
beyond
it
the
town
was
barricaded
and
occupied
to
form
a
central
support
to
the
line
there
were
in
the
rear
of
ocaña
which
might
have
served
to
hide
a
reserve
or
to
mark
a
position
for
a
rally
in
case
a
retreat
should
become
necessary
but
areizaga
had
made
no
preparation
of
this
sort
his
trains
with
a
small
escort
had
not
arrived
even
on
the
morning
of
the
nineteenth
but
were
still
belated
on
the
from
noblejas
and
la
zarza
the
order
of
the
spanish
army
in
line
of
battle
is
difficult
to
reconstruct
for
areizaga
uses
very
vague
language
in
the
dispatch
in
which
he
explained
his
defeat
and
the
other
documents
available
though
they
give
detailed
accounts
of
some
of
the
corps
say
little
or
nothing
of
others
it
seems
however
that
zayas
with
the
vanguard
division
formed
the
extreme
left
behind
the
deepest
part
of
the
ravine
with
a
cavalry
brigade
under
rivas
on
its
flank
and
rear
he
had
the
town
of
ocaña
on
his
right
then
followed
in
the
line
going
from
left
to
right
the
divisions
of
vigodet
giron
castejon
and
lacy
those
of
copons
jacomé
and
zerain
appear
to
have
formed
a
second
line
in
support
of
the
other
four
vigodet
s
left
was
in
the
town
of
ocaña
and
strongly
posted
but
the
other
flank
where
lacy
lay
was
absolutely
in
the
air
with
no
natural
feature
to
cover
it
for
this
reason
areizaga
placed
beyond
it
freire
with
the
whole
of
the
cavalry
except
the
brigade
on
the
extreme
left
under
rivas
unfortunately
the
spanish
horse
much
shaken
by
the
combat
of
the
preceding
day
was
a
weak
protection
for
the
flank
despite
its
formidable
numbers
the
sixty
guns
of
the
artillery
were
drawn
out
in
the
intervals
of
the
infantry
divisions
of
the
first
and
second
line
this
order
seems
the
only
one
consistent
with
the
sole
sentence
in
areizaga
s
dispatch
to
the
junta
in
which
he
explains
his
inmediatamente

unnamed

which
must
have
lain
beyond
copons
in
the
right
of
the
second
line
are
jacomé
and
zerain
soult
s
plan
of
attack
was
soon
formed
the
ravine
made
the
spanish
left
beyond
ocaña
inaccessible
but
also
prevented
it
from
taking
any
offensive
action
the
marshal
therefore
resolved
to
ignore
it
completely
and
to
concentrate
all
his
efforts
against
the
hostile
centre
and
right
in
the
open
ground
the
scheme
adopted
was
a
simple
one
sebastiani
s
polish
and
german
divisions
were
to
attack
the
spanish
right
wing
and
when
they
were
at
close
quarters
with
the
enemy
the
main
mass
of
the
french
cavalry
was
to
fall
upon
freire
s
horse
drive
it
out
of
the
field
and
attack
on
the
flank
the
divisions
already
engaged
with
the
infantry
for
this
purpose
milhaud
s
paris
s
and
beauregard
s
regiments
more
than
sabres
were
massed
behind
the
poles
and
germans
for
a
time
their
march
would
be
masked
by
and
undulations
of
the
ground
so
that
they
might
come
in
quite
suddenly
upon
the
enemy
mortier
with
his
first
division
that
of
girard
and
a
regiment
of
gazan
s
followed
in
the
rear
of
the
polish
and
german
infantry
to
support
their
frontal
attack
dessolles
with
his
own
brigade
and
gazan
s
remaining
one
took
post
opposite
ocaña
ready
to
fall
upon
the
spanish
centre
when
the
attack
to
his
left
should
have
begun
to
make
way
he
had
in
his
front
the
massed
artillery
of
the
and
corps
thirty
guns
under
senarmont
which
took
ground
on
a
low
knoll
above
the
great
ravine
from
which
they
could
both
play
upon
the
town
of
ocaña
and
also
enfilade
part
of
the
spanish
line
to
its
immediate
right
vigodet
s
division
and
half
of
giron
s
finally
the
king
with
his
guards
and
other
troops
horse
and
foot
were
placed
to
the
right
rear
of
dessolles
to
act
as
a
general
reserve
or
to
move
against
zayas
if
he
should
attempt
to
cross
the
ravine
and
turn
the
french
right
the
plan
despite
of
some
checks
at
the
commencement
worked
in
a
satisfactory
fashion
the
german
and
polish
divisions
of
leval
and
werlé
attacked
lacy
s
and
castejon
s
divisions
which
gave
back
some
little
way
in
order
to
align
themselves
with
vigodet
who
was
sheltered
by
the
slight
eastern
end
of
the
ravine
the
enemy
followed
and
brought
up
six
guns
to
the
point
to
play
upon
the
new
position
which
the
spaniards
had
taken
up
the
forward
movement
was
continuing
when
suddenly
to
the
surprise
of
the
french
lacy
s
castejon
s
and
giron
s
men
leaving
their
places
in
the
line
made
a
furious
upon
the
poles
and
germans
drove
them
back
for
some
distance
and
threw
them
into
disorder
this
movement
was
no
result
of
areizaga
s
generalship
he
had
betaken
himself
to
the
summit
of
the
of
ocaña
an
inconvenient
place
from
which
to
issue
orders
and
practically
left
his
subordinates
to
fight
their
own
battle
mortier
was
forced
to
bring
forward
girard
s
division
to
support
his
broken
first
line
it
was
hotly
engaged
with
lacy
and
giron
when
suddenly
it
felt
the
spaniards
slacken
in
their
fire
waver
and
break
this
was
the
result
of
the
intervention
of
a
new
force
in
the
field
the
great
mass
of
french
squadrons
which
had
been
sent
under
sebastiani
to
turn
the
spanish
right
had
now
come
into
action
arriving
close
to
freire
s
cavalry
before
it
was
discovered
it
fell
on
that
untrustworthy
corps
and
scattered
it
to
the
winds
in
a
few
minutes
then
while
three
or
four
regiments
followed
the
routed
horsemen
the
rest
turned
inwards
upon
the
hostile
infantry
the
flanks
of
the
first
and
second
lines
of
areizaga
s
right
were
charged
simultaneously
and
hardly
a
regiment
had
time
to
get
into
square
brigade
after
brigade
was
rolled
up
and
dispersed
or
captured
the
mass
of
fugitives
running
in
upon
the
troops
that
were
frontally
engaged
with
girard
wrecked
them
completely
of
the
five
divisions
of
the
spanish
left
a
certain
number
of
steady
regiments
got
away
by
closing
their
ranks
and
pushing
ahead
through
the
confusion
firing
on
friend
and
foe
alike
when
they
were
hustled
but
many
corps
were
annihilated
and
others
captured
wholesale
the
last
seems
to
have
been
the
fate
of
nearly
the
whole
of
jacomé
s
division
of
the
second
line
as
hardly
a
single
unit
from
it
is
reported
as
rallied
a
month
later
and
the
french
accounts
speak
of
a
whole
column
of
men
which
laid
down
its
arms
in
a
mass
before
the
light
cavalry
of
the
corps
just
as
the
spanish
right
broke
up
dessolles
with
his
two
brigades
followed
by
the
king
s
reserve
crossed
the
ravine
and
attacked
the
town
of
ocaña

the
two
divisions
vigodet
and
copons
which
lay
in
first
and
second
line
immediately
to

retired

better
order

the
right
of

only
zayas

sent
it
an
order
to
cross
the
ravine
and
attack
the
french
right
when
he
saw
his
army
beginning
to
break
up
then
a
few
minutes
later
he
sent
another
order
bidding
it
close
to
the
right

cover

to

found
himself
encompassed
by
masses
of
fugitives
from

s
and
lacy
s
broken
divisions
mixed
with
french
cavalry
he
sustained
with
great
credit

himself

his
troops
a
rearguard
action
for
some
miles
till
near
the
village
of
dos
barrios

was
broken

now
streamed
wildly
over

plain

in
hot
pursuit
thousands
of
prisoners
were
taken
and
the
chase
only
ended
with
nightfall
the
fugitives
headed
straight
for

reached

with
a
rapidity
even
greater
than
that
which
they
had

divisions
of
lacy
jacomé
and
zerain
had
practically
disappeared
and
the
others
had
lost
from
a
third
to
a
half
of
their
numbers
the
condition
of
the
cavalry
was
peculiarly
disgraceful
as
it
had
never
stood
to
fight
its
losses
represent
not
prisoners
for
the
most
part
but
mere
runaways
who
never
returned
to
their
standards
the
french
had
lost
about
officers
and
men
nearly
all
in
the
divisions
of
leval
werlé
and
girard
the
cavalry
which
had
delivered
the
great
stroke
and
won

martinien
s

and

that
the
german
division
lost

the
polish
division
girard
s
division
in
all
out
of
the
total
of
officers
hit
in
the
whole
army
even
allowing
for
the
fact
that
areizaga
had
been
the
victim
of
the
junta
s
insensate
resolve
to
make
an
offensive
movement
on
madrid
it
is
impossible
to
speak
with
patience
of
his
generalship
for
a
combination
of
rashness
and
vacillation
it
excels
that
of
any
other
spanish
general
during
the
whole
war
his
only
chance
was
to
catch
the
enemy
before
they
could
concentrate
he
succeeded
in
doing
this
by
his
rapid
march
from
the
passes
to
la
guardia
then
he
waited
three
days
in
deplorable
indecision
though
there
were
only
men
between
him
and
madrid
next
he
resumed
his
advance
but
by
the
circuitous
route
of
villamanrique
by
taking
which
he
lost
three
days
more
then
he
halted
again
the
moment
that
he
found
victor
with
men
in
his
front
though
he
might
still
have
fought
at
great
advantage
lastly
he
retreated
yet
so
slowly
and
unskilfully
that
he
was
finally
brought
to
action
at
ocaña
by
the
men
of
mortier
and
sebastiani
he
was
sent
out
to
win
a
battle
since
madrid
could
not
be
delivered
without
one
and
knew
that
he
must
fight
sooner
or
later
but
threw
away
his
favourable
opportunities
and
then
accepted
an
action
when
all
the
chances
were
against
him
for
he
must
have
known
by
this
time
the
miserable
quality
of
his
cavalry
yet
gave
battle
in
a
vast
plain
where
everything
depended
on
the
mounted
arm
in
the
actual
moment
of
conflict
he
seems
to
have
remained
in
a
hypnotized
condition
on
his
issuing
hardly
an
order
and
allowing
the
fight
to
go
as
it
pleased
yet
he
was
by
all
accounts
possessed
of
personal
courage
as
he
had
proved
at
alcañiz
and
elsewhere
apparently
responsibility
reduced
him
to
a
condition
of
vacillating
idiocy
perhaps
the
most
surprising
fact
of
the
whole
business
is
that
the
junta
retained
him
in
command
after
his
fiasco
thanked
him
for
his
services
and
sent
him
an
honorary
present
as
it
had
done
to
cuesta
after
medellin
with
somewhat
better
excuse
he
was
its
own
man
and
it
did
not
throw
him
over
even
when
he
had
proved
his
perfect
incompetence
to
complete
the
narrative
of
the
deplorable
autumn
campaign
of
it
only
remains
to
tell
of
the
doings
of
albuquerque
and
del
parque
the
former
played
his
part
with
reasonable
success
he
was
ordered
to
distract
the
attention
of
the
enemy
from
the
army
of
la
mancha
and
did
what
he
could
having
got
some
men
concentrated
at
almaraz
he
sent
one
column
over
the
tagus
to
demonstrate
against
the
corps
from
beyond
the
river
and
with
another
threatened
the
bridge
of
talavera
from
the
near
side
but
heudelet
now
in
command
of
the
corps
soon
found
that
there
was
no
reality
in
his
demonstration
and
that
he
was
not
supported
by
the
english
though
he
had
given
out
that
wellington
was
close
in
his
rear
after
skirmishing
around
talavera
from
the
to
the
of
november
the
duke
hastily
recrossed
the
river
on
hearing
the
news
of
ocaña
and
resumed
his
old
positions
del
parque
s
campaign
was
more
vigorous
and
more
unfortunate
while
he
lay
in
the
passes
above
bejar
and
baños
he
got
early
news
of
the
withdrawal
of
godinot
s
and
marcognet
s
troops
toward
madrid
when
soult
summoned
them
off
to
reinforce
the
main
army
he
reasoned
that
since
he
had
now
only
the
corps
shorn
of
one
of
its
brigades
in
his
front
he
might
repeat
the
success
of
tamames
for
marchand
was
weaker
than
he
had
been
in
october
while
he
himself
was
far
stronger
accordingly
he
disregarded
an
order
from
the
junta
to
extend
his
operations
southward
and
to
join
albuquerque
in
the
valley
of
the
tagus
instead
he
marched
once
more
upon
salamanca
on
november
the
day
before
the
disaster
of
ocaña
he
drove
in
an
outlying
brigade
of
marchand
s
force
from
alba
de
tormes
and
pressed
it
vigorously
back
towards
the
main
body
conscious
that
with
his
men
he
could
not
hope
to
face
marchand
promptly
evacuated
salamanca
on
december
and
retired
just
as
he
had
done
in
october
behind
the
douro
concentrating
his
whole
corps
at
toro
he
sent
urgent
demands
for
help
both
to
kellermann
at
valladolid
and
to
soult
at
madrid
by
the
time
that
they
arrived
areizaga
had
been
dealt
with
and
the
army
in
new
castile
could
spare
as
many
reinforcements
as
were
required
marcognet
s
brigade
the
one
which
had
been
borrowed
from
the
corps
was
first
sent
back
from
segovia
the
point
which
it
had
reached
in
its
southward
march
and
gazan
s
division
of
the
corps
was
ordered
by
soult
to
follow
meanwhile
del
parque
still
ignorant
of
the
disaster
in
the
south
had
occupied
salamanca
on
november
and
on
the
following
day
moved
out
towards
cantalapiedra
and
medina
del
campo
with
the
object
of
throwing
himself
between
marchand
and
kellermann
and
the
capital
this
was
an
excellent
move
and
but
for
what
had
happened
at
ocaña
might
have
had
considerable
results
since
the
army
of
the
left
ought
to
have
made
an
end
of
the
small
french
force
in
old
castile
kellermann
however
had
seen
the
danger
of
marchand
s
retreat
to
toro
and
had
directed
him
to
close
in
towards
the
east
and
to
occupy
medina
del
campo
as
the
strategical
point
that
must
be
held
in
order
to
maintain
touch
with
madrid
thus
it
chanced
that
on
november
labassée
s
brigade
and
four
regiments
of
cavalry
coming
from
tordesillas
reached
medina
del
campo
just
as
marcognet
s
brigade
returning
from
segovia
came
into
the
town
from
the
other
side
they
had
hardly
met
when
the
approach
of
del
parque
s
army
along
the
salamanca
road
was
reported
the
two
french
brigadiers
thought
for
a
moment
of
fighting
and
the
cavalry
was
ordered
to
press
back
the
spanish
advanced
guard
they
drove
off
with
ease
anglona
s
horsemen
who
rode
at
the
head
of
the
long
column
but
were
repulsed
by
ballasteros
s
infantry
which
formed
square
in
good
style
and
drove
them
off
with
a
rolling
fire
of
musketry
seeing
that
the
whole
spanish
army
was
coming
up
marcognet
and
labassée
then
evacuated
medina
del
campo
and
retired
to
valdestillas
with
one
push
more
the
spaniards
could
have
cut
the
line
between
valladolid
and
madrid
on
november
the
whole
corps
and
kellermann
s
dragoons
with
a
battalion
or
two
from
the
garrisons
of
old
castile
were
concentrated
at
puente
de
duero
with
their
van
at
valdestillas
if
attacked
they
must
have
gone
behind
the
douro
and
abandoned
all
touch
with
madrid
for
there
were
not
more
than
men
in
line
and
they
were
forced
to
take
the
defensive
but
to
their
surprise
del
parque
made
no
advance
he
had
heard
on
that
morning
of
the
disaster
of
ocaña
and
guessed
that
reinforcements
for
kellermann
must
already
be
on
the
march
wherefore
he
resolved
to
regain
the
mountains
without
delay
and
to
give
up
salamanca
and
his
other
conquests
with
this
prudent
resolve
he
broke
up
from
medina
del
campo
and
marched
hastily
away
in
retreat
making
not
for
salamanca
which
was
too
much
in
the
plains
to
please
him
but
for
alba
de
tormes
he
had
gained
a
day
s
start
by
his
prompt
action
but
on
the
kellermann
set
off
in
pursuit
leaving
orders
for
the
troops
that
were
expected
from
madrid
to
follow
him
on
the
and
the
french
cavalry
failed
even
to
get
in
touch
with
del
parque
s
rearguard
and
found
nothing
but
a
few
stragglers
on
the
road
but
on
the
afternoon
of
the
the
leading
squadrons
reported
that
they
had
come
upon
the
whole
spanish
army
encamped
in
a
mass
around
the
town
of
alba
de
tormes
the
duke
had
flattered
himself
that
he
had
shaken
off
his
pursuers
and
was
surprised
in
a
most
unfortunate
position
two
of
his
divisions
ballasteros
and
castrofuerte
were
beyond
the
tormes
preparing
to
bivouac
on
the
upland
above
it
the
other
three
were
quartered
in
and
about
the
town
while
the
cavalry
was
watching
the
road
but
had
fallen
in
so
close
to
the
main
body
that
its
vedettes
gave
very
short
notice
of
the
approach
of
the
enemy
kellermann
was
riding
with
the
leading
brigade
of
his
cavalry
lorcet
s
and
hussars
the
six
regiments
of
dragoons
were
close
behind
him
so
that
he
had
over
sabres
in
hand
but
the
infantry
was
ten
miles
to
the
rear
if
he
waited
for
it
del
parque
would
have
time
to
cross
the
river
and
take
up
a
defensive
position
behind
it
the
french
general
therefore
resolved
to
risk
a
most
hazardous
experiment
an
attack
with
unsupported
cavalry
upon
a
force
of
all
arms
in
the
hope
of
detaining
it
till
the
infantry
should
come
up
the
spaniards
were
getting
into
line
of
battle
in
a
hurry
losada
s
division
on
the
right
belveder
s
and
la
carrera
s
on
the
left
the
cavalry
sabres
at
most
in
their
front
the
divisions
beyond
the
river
were
only
beginning
to
assemble
and
would
take
some
time
to
recross
the
narrow
bridge
but
men
were
on
the
right
bank
prepared
to
fight
without
a
moment
s
delay
kellermann
ordered
lorcet
s
brigade
to
charge
the
spanish
right
and
centre
it
was
followed
by
the
six
regiments
of
dragoons
in
three
successive
lines
and
the
whole
mass
came
down
like
a
whirlwind
upon
del
parque
s
front
scattering
his
cavalry
to
the
winds
and
breaking
the
whole
of
losada
s
and
the
right
of
belveder
s
divisions
a
battery
of
artillery
and
nearly
prisoners
were
taken
the
wrecks
of
the
broken
divisions
fell
back
into
alba
de
tormes
and
jammed
the
bridge
thus
preventing
the
divisions
on
the
further
side
from
recrossing
it
kellermann
then
rallied
his
squadrons
and
led
them
against
la
carrera
s
division
and
the
remaining
battalions
of
that
of
belveder
these
troops
formed
in
upon
a
rising
ground
held
out
gallantly
and
repulsed
the
charge
but
they
were
cut
off
from
the
bridge
which
they
could
only
reach
by
a
dangerous
flank
movement
over
rough
ground
by
continually
threatening
to
repeat
his
attacks
kellermann
kept
them
from
moving
off
till
two
hours
and
a
half
after
the
action
had
begun
the
french
infantry
and
guns
commenced
to
come
up
la
carrera
saw
that
it
would
be
fatal
to
await
them
and
bade
his
division
retreat
and
reach
the
bridge
as
best
it
could
this
was
naturally
done
in
disorder
and
with
some
loss
but
it
was
already
growing
dusk
and
the
bulk
of
the
spanish
left
got
away
while
the
spaniards
were
defiling
over
the
bridge
marchand
s
leading
brigade
attacked
alba
out
of
which
it
drove
some
rallied
troops
of
losada
s
division
who
held
the
town
to
cover
la
carrera
s
retreat
this
was
done
with
ease
for
del
parque
had
not
brought
over
his
two
intact
divisions
preferring
to
use
them
as
a
second
line
behind
which
the
others
could
retire
alba
was
stormed
and
two
guns
which
had
been
placed
behind
a
barricade
at
its
main
exit
were
taken
by
the
french
here
the
fighting
stopped
the
spaniards
had
lost
five
flags
nine
guns
most
of
their
baggage
and
about
killed
or
taken
no
very
ruinous
deductions
from
an
army
of
men
the
french
casualties
were
less
than
in
all
del
parque
was
determined
not
to
fight
again
next
morning
and
bade
his
army
make
off
under
cover
of
the
night
the
disorder
that
followed
was
frightful
the
three
divisions
that
had
been
in
the
battle
dispersed
and
went
off
in
all
directions
some
towards
ciudad
rodrigo
others
towards
tamames
others
by
the
that
leads
towards
tala
and
the
pass
of
baños
many
of
the
raw
leonese
troops
though
they
had
not
been
engaged
also
left
their
colours
in
the
dark
it
was
a
full
month
before
del
parque
could
collect
his
whole
army
which
when
it
had
been
reorganized
was
found
to
number
men
despite
all
its
misfortunes
it
would
seem
therefore
that
beside
the
losses
in
the
battle
some
men
must
have
gone
off
to
their
homes
the
duke
fixed
his
head
quarters
at
san
martin
de
trebejos
in
the
sierra
de
gata
and
dispersed
his
infantry
in
cantonments
about
bejar
fuenteguinaldo
and
miranda
de
castanar
having
only
the
ruined
region
around
coria
and
plasencia
and
the
small
district
about
ciudad
rodrigo
to
feed
them
these
troops
suffered
dreadful
privations
during
the
winter
living
on
eked
out
with
edible
acorns
by
the
middle
of
january
they
had
lost
men
from
fever
dysentery
and
starvation
martinien
s
lists
show
officers
killed
and
wounded
there
is
a
long
report
by
del
parque
in
the
record
office
in
which
he
states
that
the
panic
was
caused
by
a
stray
party
of
his
own
routed
cavalry
dashing
in
among
the
rearguard
in
the
dark
and
crying
that
the
french
were
pursuing
them
he
afterwards
and
shot
some
cavalrymen
for
cowardice
despite
all
this
it
is
fair
to
say
that
del
parque
s
campaign
contrasts
most
favourably
with
that
of
areizaga
he
showed
a
laudable
prudence
when
he
twice
evacuated
salamanca
rather
than
fight
a
battle
in
the
plain
his
victory
of
tamames
was
most
creditable
showing
that
when
prudently
conducted
and
ranged
in
a
his
army
could
give
a
good
account
of
itself
but
for
the
disaster
of
alba
de
tormes
his
record
might
be
considered
excellent
there
it
is
true
he
committed
a
grave
mistake
by
separating
his
army
into
two
halves
by
the
river
when
his
enemy
was
in
pursuit
but
in
his
defence
it
may
be
urged
that
his
cavalry
ought
to
have
had
vedettes
out
for
ten
or
fifteen
miles
to
the
rear
and
to
have
given
him
long
warning
of
the
approach
of
the
french
and
when
the
enemy
s
horse
did
make
its
sudden
appearance
it
was
contrary
to
the
laws
of
probability
that
it
would
attack
at
once
without
waiting
for
its
infantry
and
guns
kellermann
s
headlong
charge
was
a
violation
of
all
rules
a
stroke
of
inspiration
which
could
not
have
been
foreseen
if
the
spanish
cavalry
had
been
of
any
use
whatever
and
if
losada
s
division
had
only
known
how
to
form
square
in
a
hurry
it
ought
to
have
been
beaten
off
but
the
of
a
spanish
army
was
always
a
doubtful
quantity
kellermann
resolved
to
take
the
risk
of
attacking
and
was
rewarded
by
a
victory
on
which
he
was
not
entitled
to
reckon
he
would
probably
have
justified
his
tactics
by
urging
that
failure
could
have
no
severe
penalty
for
the
spaniards
could
not
pursue
him
if
he
were
repulsed
while
success
would
bring
splendid
results
this
was
true
and
if
his
infantry
had
been
five
miles
more
to
the
front
he
might
have
captured
the
whole
of

the
news
of
the
disaster
of
ocaña
gave
a
to
the
central
junta
its
attempt
to
win
back
its
lost
credit
by
an
offensive
campaign
against
madrid
having
ended
in
such
a
lamentable
fashion
there
was
nothing
left
for
it
but
to
acquiesce
in
its
own
supersession
by
the
national
cortes
but
that
assembly
was
not
to
meet
till
march
a
date
still
four
months
in
the
future
and
even
its
form
and
constitution
had
not
yet
been
settled
for
it
would
have
been
absurd
to
have
called
it
together
in
the
ancient
and
unrepresentative
shape
a
legacy
from
the
time
of
charles
v
in
which
it
had
been
wont
to
meet
under
the
bourbon
kings
many
regions
had
few
or
no
members
decayed
mediaeval
towns
of
old
castile
had
more
deputies
than
the
most
populous
provinces
moreover
it
had
yet
to
be
settled
how
that
larger
half
of
the
realm
which
was
now
occupied
by
the
french
was
to
elect
its
representatives
the
commission
was
still
sitting
to
determine
these
vital
points
and
in
this
moment
of
dismay
the
day
of
the
assembly
of
the
cortes
seemed
very
far
distant
the
french
might
be
following
hard
on
the
heels
of
areizaga
s
broken
host
and
might
enter
seville
long
before
it
had
been
decided
what
sort
of
a
cortes
was
to
take
over
the
power
from
the
hands
of
the
discredited
central
junta
that
most
unhappy
government
therefore
had
to
face
both
an
acute
constitutional
crisis
and
an
acute
military
crisis
something
had
to
be
done
without
delay
to
satisfy
public
opinion
concerning
the
convocation
of
the
cortes
or
the
revolution
which
had
been
checked
by
wellesley
s
aid
in
september
would
certainly
burst
forth
again
but
even
more
pressing
was
the
necessity
for
rallying
and
reinforcing
the
army
which
had
been
crushed
at
ocaña
before
the
french
should
resume
their
advance
the
actual
administrative
power
was
for
the
moment
in
the
hand
of
the
first
of
those
temporary
executive
committees
to
which
the
junta
had
agreed
to
delegate
its
authority
by
the
decree
of
september
this
body
composed
of
six
members
among
whom
la
romana
was
numbered
had
come
into
office
on
november
the
rest
of
the
junta
were
only
too
eager
to
throw
on
their
comrades
the
weight
of
the
responsibility
which
should
have
fallen
upon
them
all
the
executive
committee
was
accused
on
all
sides
of
slow
and
feeble
action
it
published
as
soon
as
possible
the
details
concerning
the
constitution
of
the
forthcoming
cortes
which
in
pursuance
of
the
recommendation
of
the
commission
of
inquiry
was
to
consist
of
two
classes
of
members
elected
representatives
who
were
to
be
allotted
in
due
proportion
to
all
the
provinces
of
the
realm
and
privilegiados
or
chosen
individuals
from
the
nobility
and
the
higher
clergy
the
american
colonies
were
to
be
given
members
no
less
than
the
mother
country
but
their
numbers
were
to
be
small
such
an
arrangement
seemed
to
foreshadow
a
legislature
resembling
that
of
great
britain
and
british
precedents
had
no
doubt
been
running
in
the
minds
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
but
as
we
shall
see
the
cortes
when
it
actually
met
took
no
such
shape
the
mandate
for
the
election
of
the
assembly
was
duly
published
and
so
far
public
opinion
was
to
a
certain
extent
satisfied
for
it
was
clear
that
the
central
junta
was
at
last
about
to
abdicate
but
though
the
majority
of
the
spanish
people
were
contented
to
wait
provided
that
the
executive
committee
should
show
signs
of
rising
to
the
occasion
and
doing
its
best
as
an
government
there
were
some
politicians
who
saw
in
the
crisis
only
an
opportunity
for
pushing
their
private
ambitions
those
veteran
intriguers
the
conde
de
montijo
and
francisco
palafox
undismayed
by
the
failure
of
the
september
plot
began
to
make
arrangements
with
the
seville
demagogues
for
a
fresh
attempt
at
a
d
their
plots
seem
to
have
distracted
romana
and
his
colleagues
from
their
obvious
military
duties
the
conspirator
at
home
is
always
the
enemy
who
looms
most
large
before
the
eyes
of
a
weak
government
but
after
some
search
both
were
discovered
arrested
and
imprisoned
meanwhile
the
executive
committee
with
the
junta
s
approval
issued
a
long
series
of
edicts
concerning
the
reorganization
of
the
army
and
the
defence
of
andalusia
from
the
french
attack
which
might
at
any
moment
begin
the
army
of
the
centre
of
which
areizaga
was
still
strange
to
say
left
in
command
was
to
be
raised
to
men
by
a
strenuous
conscription
the
press
was
to
be
married
men
novices
in
monasteries
persons
in
minor
orders
only
sons
of
widows
all
the
classes
hitherto
exempt
were
to
be
subject
to
it
to
provide
funds
the
clergy
were
ordered
to
send
in
to
the
mint
all
church
plate
save
such
as
was
strictly
necessary
for
the
celebration
of
the
sacraments
and
all
private
citizens
were
bidden
to
contribute
one
half
of
their
in
order
to
provide
teams
for
the
artillery
which
had
lost
nearly
all
its
horses
and
guns
at
ocaña
a
strict
requisition
for
draught
animals
was
begun
all
over
andalusia
engineers
were
sent
out
to
fortify
all
the
passes
of
the
sierra
morena
with
permission
to
exact
forced
labour
from
the
peasantry
of
the
hill
country
three
members
of
the
junta
rabe
riquelme
and
campo
sagrado
were
sent
to
areizaga
s
head
quarters
at
la
carolina
as
field
deputies
to
stir
up
or
support
the
energy
of
the
this
was
a
device
borrowed
from
the
practice
of
the
french
revolution
and
had
no
better
effect
than
might
have
been
expected
as
in
the
representatives
on
mission
were
either
useless
or
positively
harmful
they
either
wished
to
thrust
amateurish
plans
of
their
own
upon
the
military
men
or
at
least
distracted
them
by
constant
inquisitorial
supervision
on
the
whole
the
effect
of
this
volley
of
violent
decrees
was
small
with
six
months
to
carry
them
out
they
might
no
doubt
have
produced
great
results
but
within
nine
weeks
after
the
disaster
of
ocaña
the
french
had
commenced
their
attack
and
in
that
space
of
time
little
had
been
accomplished
the
money
was
beginning
to
come
in
the
recruits
were
being
collected
but
had
not
been
armed
or
clothed
still
less
drilled
of
the
fortifications
in
the
passes
many
had
been
sketched
out
but
only
a
few
had
begun
to
take
tangible
shape
to
man
them
there
was
still
only
the
wrecks
of
areizaga
s
old
army
which
had
hardly
begun
to
receive
its
drafts
of
conscripts
its
whole
force
at
the
new
year
did
not
exceed
men
and
these
were
distributed
over
a
front
of
more
than
miles
for
not
only
the
main
group
of
passes
in
front
of
la
carolina
had
to
be
watched
but
also
the
eastern
ingress
into
andalusia
by
baeza
and
ubeda
and
the
western
defiles
from
almaden
and
benalcazar
which
lead
directly
down
on
to
cordova
the
whole
was
in
a
state
of
desperate
turmoil
and
excitement
yet
very
little
in
the
way
of
practical
defence
had
been
completed
by
the
middle
of
january
meanwhile
in
accordance
with
the
ridiculous
constitution
of
the
executive
committee
half
of
its
members
went
out
of
office
at
the
new
year
and
were
succeeded
by
other
individuals
of
the
junta
among
those
superseded
was
la
romana
who
was
now
directed
to
go
off
to
valencia
as
the
junta
seems
to
have
considered
that
he
would
be
less
dangerous
in
company
with
his
brother
josé
caro
in
that
province
than
when
posted
at
the
seat
of
government
with
his
brother
to
back
him
by
threats
of
valencian
military
interference
yet
la
romana
did
not
depart
and
was
still
lingering
at
seville
when
the
french
crossed
the
sierra
morena
there
was
a
larger
military
problem
before
the
junta
and
the
new
executive
committee
than
the
mere
defence
of
andalusia
the
whole
arrangement
of
the
national
armies
had
to
be
recast
in
consequence
of
the
black
day
of
ocaña
the
corps
of
del
parque
and
albuquerque
as
well
as
all
the
smaller
outlying
bodies
of
troops
had
to
receive
new
orders
above
all
it
was
necessary
to
discover
what
were
the
plans
of
wellington
for
the
present
position
of
the
british
army
at
badajoz
was
the
most
important
factor
in
the
whole
situation
as
long
as
it
remained
there
in
support
of
the
small
force
under
albuquerque
which
was
guarding
the
passages
of
the
tagus
at
almaraz
and
arzobispo
the
western
section
of
the
front
of
andalusia
was
secure
the
defence
of
the
eastern
section
too
was
in
no
small
degree
helped
by
the
fact
that
wellington
s
solid
troops
were
in
a
position
to
march
up
the
guadiana
and
to
threaten
the
flank
of
any
french
army
which
might
intend
to
attack
the
or
any
other
of
the
passes
which
lead
from
la
mancha
down
to
the
andalusian
plains
it
was
a
terribly
disquieting
fact
for
the
junta
that
even
before
ocaña
had
been
fought
and
lost
wellington
had
begun
to
announce
his
intention
of
leaving
badajoz
and
retiring
within
the
boundaries
of
portugal
he
had
paid
a
flying
visit
to
seville
on
the
of
november
just
as
areizaga
s
unhappy
advance
into
la
mancha
was
commencing
the
project
had
been
concealed
from
him
and
when
he
learnt
of
it
he
had
expressed
his
entire
disapprobation
of
it
and
had
refused
to
give
any
promise
to
support
the
spanish
armies
in
their
offensive
movements
for
this
reason
he
had
been
bitterly
provoked
when
areizaga
and
albuquerque
both
wrote
him
a
little
later
to
say
that
they
had
been
promised
the
assistance
of
his
army
by
the
junta
he
had
consistently
prophesied
ill
of
the
adventure
and
had
recorded
his
opinion
that
both
del
parque
and
areizaga
would
probably
lose
their
armies
in
a
dispatch
of
november
six
days
before
the
news
of
ocaña
reached
him
he
had
announced
his
definite
intention
of
leaving
badajoz
with
the
main
body
of
his
army
and
transferring
himself
to
the
north
of
the
tagus
where
by
posting
himself
in
the
portuguese
province
of
beira
he
would
cover
the
to
lisbon
from
old
castile
this
decision
was
founded
on
his
belief
that
when
the
french
had
made
an
end
of
areizaga
and
del
parque
a
contingency
which
he
regarded
as
almost
certain
they
would
strike
at
lisbon
and
not
at
seville
he
had
good
reasons
for
holding
this
view
it
was
exactly
consonant
with
napoleon
s
own
plan
which
was
only
abandoned
by
reason
of
king
joseph
s
pleadings
with
his
brother
for
from
the
french
standpoint
it
was
far
more
profitable
to
conquer
portugal
and
to
expel
the
british
army
from
the
peninsula
than
to
overrun
andalusia
wellington
and
his
troops
formed
the
one
solid
nucleus
of
resistance
which
still
remained
it
was
clear
that
the
dispersion
of
the
miserable
wrecks
of
areizaga
s
host
would
present
no
difficulty
and
not
only
was
it
advisable
from
the
emperor
s
point
of
view
to
destroy
the
most
formidable
hostile
force
still
surviving
but
the
balance
of
strategical
advantage
was
all
in
favour
of
subduing
portugal
before
andalusia
should
be
invaded
for
portugal
flanks
the
attack
on
southern
spain
and
a
good
army
based
upon
it
could
check
the
advance
on
seville
and
cadiz
by
demonstrations
aimed
at
valladolid
or
madrid
which
might
wreck
or
delay
the
conquest
of
andalusia
it
may
be
objected
that
andalusia
also
flanks
the
attack
on
portugal
but
the
objection
had
no
validity
since
the
day
of
ocaña
as
the
junta
had
now
no
longer
any
striking
force
in
hand
it
would
be
many
months
before
areizaga
s
host
was
in
a
proper
condition
for
undertaking
even
cautious
defensive
operations
a
french
attack
on
portugal
therefore
would
be
practically
unmolested
by
external
interference
he
then
pushed
on
to
cadiz
where
he
was
on
the
spent
a
night
at
seville
again
on
the
and
was
back
at
badajoz
on
the
of
november
at
cadiz
he
parted
with
his
brother
who
was
just
embarking
for
england
to
take
up
his
place
in
the
new
ministry
as
late
as
he
had
written
to
colonel
roche
the
british
officer
attached
to
the
staff
of
the
army
of
the
centre
to
beg
him
to
press
on
the
areizaga
the
necessity
of
adopting
a
defensive
posture
and
risking
nothing
from
the
wording
of
the
letter
it
is
clear
that
no
hint
of
the
orders
sent
to
areizaga
from
seville
had
reached
badajoz
see
also
the
dispatch
to
castlereagh
on
see
wellington
to
roche
and
to
frère
badajoz
and
nothing
can
save
them
save
a
victory
by
areizaga
and
the
possession
of
madrid
are
the
most
improbable
of
if
del
parque
and
albuquerque
are
destroyed
is
not
unlikely
indeed
pretty
we
must
make
our
arrangements
for
the
defence
of
wellington
to
beresford
at
the
present
moment
the
strength
of
the
french
troops
in
spain
was
not
sufficient
to
provide
two
armies
for
offensive
purposes
the
one
destined
to
march
on
seville
the
other
on
lisbon
the
numbers
at
the
front
had
not
appreciably
increased
since
the
autumn
though
already
the
reinforcements
which
the
emperor
had
set
upon
the
march
after
concluding
his
peace
with
austria
had
begun
to
appear
at
bayonne
and
to
cross
the
bidassoa
but
in
december
and
january
the
roads
were
bad
the
days
short
and
provisions
hard
to
procure
hence
wellington
reckoned
that
till
the
spring
should
arrive
the
allies
would
have
to
face
no
more
than
the
forces
which
were
already
opposed
to
them
when
however
the
campaigning
season
should
have
come
round
and
the
reinforcements
from
germany
should
have
been
incorporated
with
the
old
army
of
spain
he
thought
that
portugal
would
be
the
enemy
s
main
objective
it
was
therefore
his
intention
to
withdraw
his
army
or
at
least
the
greater
part
of
it
from
spanish
estremadura
and
to
arrange
it
so
as
to
cover
lisbon
even
though
by
making
this
movement
he
was
weakening
the
left
flank
of
the
defence
of
andalusia
if
he
had
to
choose
between
the
interests
of
portugal
and
those
of
spain
he
was
prepared
to
sacrifice
the
latter
his
reasons
were
simple
he
considered
portugal
more
important
in
the
grand
strategy
of
the
defence
of
the
peninsula
than
andalusia
he
regarded
it
as
more
defensible
and
he
had
already
as
we
shall
presently
see
sketched
out
and
commenced
the
construction
of
his
great
lines
of
torres
vedras
in
which
his
trust
as
a
final
impregnable
stronghold
was
already
fixed
he
held
that
although
great
britain
was
pledged
to
assist
both
spain
and
portugal
yet
her
moral
obligation
to
the
latter
was
far
more
binding
since
portugal
had
placed
herself
entirely
in
the
hands
of
her
allies
had
put
her
army
at
their
disposal
and
had
contributed
all
her
resources
to
the
common
cause
while
the
spanish
junta
had
shown
a
jealous
and
suspicious
spirit
had
refused
to
show
confidence
in
great
britain
and
had
persisted
in
carrying
out
a
military
policy
of
its
own
which
led
to
a
consistent
series
of
disasters
the
portuguese
army
though
its
fighting
power
was
not
as
yet
ascertained
could
be
at
least
relied
upon
for
obedience
experience
had
shown
that
the
promises
of
the
spaniards
could
not
be
trusted
and
that
any
campaign
undertaken
in
their
company
might
be
wrecked
by
some
incalculable
piece
of
slackness
or
miscalculation
wellington
s
arguments
must
be
culled
from
his
various
dispatches
to
lord
liverpool
and
other
ministers
in
november
and
december
for
the
first
of
the
motives
quoted
above
see
wellington
to
liverpool
the
object
in
occupying
this
proposed
position
in
beira
is
to
be
at
the
point
of
the
defence
of
portugal
to
divert
the
attention
of
the
french
from
the
south
of
spain
when
they
shall
receive
their
reinforcements
and
thus
to
give
time
to
the
spanish
government
to
repair
their
losses
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
cross
the
tagus
immediately
as
it
may
be
depended
upon
that
the
enemy
s
first
effort

very
much
the
same
opinion
is
expressed
in
the
earlier
dispatch
to
lord
liverpool
of
november
expressions
of
wellington
s
conviction
that
it
was
impossible
to
with
the
junta
or
the
spanish
generals
may
be
found
in
all
his
confidential
letters
see
for
example
that
to
sir
anstruther
pp
of
vol
vi
accordingly
on
november
wellington
declared
his
intention
of
withdrawing
his
army
save
one
single
division
to
the
north
of
the
tagus
and
of
placing
it
at
various
points
in
the
province
of
beira
so
as
to
cover
all
the
practicable
roads
to
lisbon
from
the
side
of
old
castile
on
the
he
sent
formal
notice
of
his
intentions
to
seville
well
knowing
the
storm
of
indignation
that
would
be
roused
thereby
at
the
same
time
he
advised
the
junta
to
reinforce
albuquerque
s
army
of
estremadura
with
troops
drawn
from
del
parque
adding
that
to
keep
albuquerque
well
to
the
front
in
his
present
positions
at
almaraz
and
arzobispo
was
the
best
means
of
protecting
the
western
approaches
of
andalusia
del
parque
s
corps
whose
reason
for
existence
was
the
containing
of
the
french
troops
in
old
castile
would
be
able
to
spare
troops
to
strengthen
the
army
of
estremadura
because
the
english
host
in
its
new
position
would
be
behind
it
and
opposed
to
the
forces
under
kellermann
and
marchand
which
had
hitherto
had
nothing
in
their
front
but
the
army
of
the
moreover
it
would
be
an
appreciable
relief
to
del
parque
who
was
finding
the
greatest
difficulty
in
feeding
his
army
in
the
mountain
region
between
ciudad
rodrigo
and
bejar
to
be
freed
from
the
burden
of
maintaining
one
or
two
of
his
five
divisions
the
junta
as
might
have
been
expected
took
wellington
s
determination
to
remove
from
badajoz
with
the
worst
of
graces
they
could
hardly
have
failed
to
do
so
when
one
of
his
main
reasons
for
departing
barely
concealed
in
his
dispatches
to
them
was
his
fear
of
getting
involved
in
their
operations
and
his
reluctance
to
place
his
troops
in
line
with
the
spanish
armies
nor
could
they
have
been
expected
to
agree
with
his
strategical
view
that
lisbon
not
cadiz
would
be
the
main
objective
of
the
grand
advance
of
the
french
armies
when
the
spring
should
come
round
to
every
man
or
body
of
men
their
own
possible
dangers
naturally
seem
more
imminent
and
more
interesting
than
those
of
their
neighbours
the
departure
of
the
english
from
badajoz
was
formally
announced
to
the
junta
on
november
and
began
to
be
carried
out
on
december
when
the
brigade
of
guards
marched
for
portalegre
and
was
followed
on
successive
days
by
the
other
brigades
of
the
army
by
the
of
december
wellington
and
his
staff
alone
were
left
in
the
estremaduran
fortress
and
next
day
his
head
quarters
were
at
elvas
across
the
frontier
the
second
division
under
hill
halted
at
abrantes
where
wellington
intended
to
leave
it
as
the
nucleus
of
a
covering
force
which
was
to
guard
lisbon
from
any
possible
attack
from
the
south
side
of
the
tagus
the
rest
of
the
army
pursued
its
way
across
the
mountains
of
beira
and
by
january
head
quarters
were
at
coimbra
and
the
main
body
of
the
british
troops
was
beginning
to
take
up
billets
in
the
small
towns
of
the
valley
of
the
mondego
convinced
that
no
more
was
to
be
hoped
from
wellington
the
executive
committee
issued
their
orders
for
a
new
arrangement
of
the
line
of
defence
of
andalusia
albuquerque
was
ordered
to
leave
no
more
than
a
small
corps
of
observation
on
the
tagus
in
front
of
almaraz
and
to
bring
back
the
main
body
of
the
army
of
estremadura
to
the
line
of
the
guadiana
in
order
to
link
his
right
wing
to
the
left
of
areizaga
s
forces
on
december
his
new
head
quarters
were
at
don
benito
and
he
had
some
men
collected
there
and
at
the
neighbouring
town
of
merida
the
rest
of
his
small
army
was
furnishing
the
garrison
of
badajoz
and
the
detached
force
on
the
tagus
whose
duty
was
to
watch
the
movements
of
the
french
corps
which
still
lay
in
its
old
post
at
talavera
and
remained
entirely
quiescent
from
albuquerque
s
post
at
don
benito
there
was
a
gap
of
miles
to
the
next
force
in
the
spanish
line
this
consisted
of
the
wrecks
of
the
two
old
divisions
of
copons
and
zerain
from
the
army
of
areizaga
not
more
than
strong

were
encamped
at

at

the

northern
exit
of

two

the
puerto

on
to

the

the
other
by
villanueva
de

and
adamuz
both
are
difficult
both
pass
through
a
desolate
and
uninhabited
country
but
either
of
them
might
conceivably
serve
for
the
passage
of

sixty

the
central

upon

the

covering
the

areizaga
had
concentrated
the
remains
of
the

of
zayas
castejon
giron
and
lacy
of
which
the
last
two
were
mere
wrecks
while
the
two
former
counted
about
bayonets
apiece
finally
some
fifteen
miles
off
to
the
right
the
remnants
of
the
divisions
of
vigodet
and
jacomé

in
all

the
two
easternmost

from

of

in
the
various
new
entrenchments
which
were
being
thrown
up
his
cavalry

for
the
most
part
been
sent
back
to
recruit
and
reform
itself
in
the
interior
of
the
province
being
useless
in
the
mountains
the
papers
in
the
madrid
archives
show
that
copons
had
about
men
zerain
whose
division
had
been
almost
entirely
destroyed
about
the
mere
description
of
this
disposition
of
forces
is
sufficient
to
show
the
hopeless
condition
of
the
defence
of
andalusia
areizaga
was
trying
to
cover
every
possible
line
by
which
the
french
might
advance
with
the
result
that
his
army
and
that
of
albuquerque
were
strung
out
on
a
front
of
miles
and
could
not
concentrate
men
on
any
single
point
the
passes
which
they
were
trying
to
guard
were
not
only
numerous
but
in
several
cases
very
practicable
where
roads
lay
not
between
cliffs
or
precipices
but
over
slopes
which
could
be
ascended
by
infantry
on
each
side
of
the
pass
the
fortifications
and
the
troops
holding
them
could
be
turned
by
enemies
who
took
the
trouble
to
climb
the
side
acclivities
it
was
clear
that
if
the
french
chose
to
attack
the
sierra
morena
with
no
more
than
the
men
who
had
been
concentrated
after
the
battle
of
ocaña
they
could
bring
an
overwhelming
force
to
bear
on
any
one
or
two
of
the
passes
which
they
might
select
while
leaving
the
garrisons
of
the
rest
alone
or
threatening
them
with
trifling
demonstrations
if
the
enemy
should
choose
to
strike
by
almaden
at
cordova
the
spanish
centre
and
right
wing
would
be
cut
off
from
their
retreat
on
seville
and
would
have
to
take
refuge
in
the
kingdom
of
murcia
if
the
and
its
neighbours
should
turn
out
to
be
the
selected
objective
areizaga
s
right
wing
must
suffer
the
same
fate
and
if
driven
from
the
passes
the
army
would
have
to
encounter
in
the
broad
plain
behind
the
overpowering
force
of
french
cavalry
which
king
joseph
could
bring
up
the
problem
set
before
the
defence
was
a
hopeless
one
and
most
of
the
generals
under
areizaga
were
aware
of
the
fact
as
indeed
were

rank
and

and
his

when
considering
the
action
of
the
french
after
the
victory
of
ocaña
it
is
necessary
to
remember
that
king
joseph
and
soult
were
not
in
the
position
of
ordinary
invaders
who
have
just
succeeded
in
demolishing
the
last
army
of
their
enemy
in
wars
of
a
normal
type
the
victor
knows
that
the
vanquished
will
sue
for
terms
when
further
resistance
appears
hopeless
he
proceeds
to
dictate
the
cessions
of
territory
or
payments
of
indemnities
that
he
thinks
proper
as
the
price
of
peace
but
it
was
not
a
profitable
treaty
which
napoleon
desired
he
had
put
it
out
of
his
own
power
to
end
the
war
in
such
a
fashion
when
he
declared
his
brother
king
of
spain
for
him
there
was
no
spanish
government
in
existence
save
that
which
he
had
set
up
at
madrid
the
central
junta
and
the
cortes
when
it
should
meet
were
mere
illegal
assemblies
with
which
he
could
not
deign
to
enter
into
negotiations
it
was
now
perfectly
clear
that
the
spaniards
would
never
submit
of
their
own
accord
their
position
in
december
desperate
as
it
might
be
was
no
worse
than
it
had
been
in
the
march
of
the
same
year
areizaga
s
army
had
suffered
no
more
at
ocaña
than
had
those
of
cuesta
and
cartaojal
nine
months
before
on
the
disastrous
fields
of
medellin
and
ciudad
real
indeed
there
were
probably
more
men
actually
in
line
to
defend
andalusia
in
december
than
there
had
been
in
april
moreover
in
the
early
spring
soult
had
been
in
the
full
career
of
conquest
in
portugal
and
nothing
save
cradock
s
insignificant
force
appeared
to
prevent
his
onward
march
to
lisbon

on
the
other
hand
the
flank
of
andalusia
was
covered
by
wellington
s
victorious
army
and
by
the
reorganized
portuguese
host
of
beresford
if
the
junta
had
refused
to
listen
to
the
insidious
advances
of
sotelo
in
april
there
was
no
reason
to
suppose
that
it
would
lend
a
ready
ear
to
any
similar
advocate
of
submission
in

indeed
its
every
action
showed
a
resolve
to
fight

was
held
down
by

must
each
corner
of
the

be

after

insurrection
burst
out
at

and
the
weary
process
of
pacification
had
to
be
repeated
it
was
this
last
fact
that
restrained

from
following
up

the

of
the
spanish

to
the

defeated

the
other
smaller

that
was
dealing
with

leon
the
king
had
been
forced
to
concentrate
all
his
divisions
and
the
consequence
had
been
that
the
control
of
the
broad
tracts
behind
him
had
been
lost
we
have
already
had
occasion
to
mention
that
throughout
old
castile
and
leon
the
open
country
was
now
in
the
hands
of
the
guerrilleros
who
had
been
growing
in
force
and
numbers
ever
since
the
time
of
talavera
and
had
risen
to
the
height
of
their
confidence
after
the
day
of
tamames
and
del
parque
s
repeated
occupation
of
salamanca
navarre
and
many
parts
of
new
castile
were
equally
disturbed
and
aragon
which
suchet
had
tamed
during
the
autumn
was
beginning
once
more
to
move
there
were
no
french
troops
in
the
disturbed
regions
save
scanty
garrisons
at
burgos
valladolid
benavente
avila
segovia
guadalajara
palencia
tudela
tafalla
and
a
few
other
strategic
points
these
were
cut
off
from
each
other
and
from
madrid
save
when
a
governor
sent
out
his
messenger
with
an
escort
many
hundreds
strong
and
even
such
a
force
had
often
to
fight
its
way
through
half
a
dozen
bands
before
reaching
its
destination
the
garrisons
themselves
were
not
always
safe
so
powerful
were
the
bands
of
some
of
the
guerrillero
chiefs
that
they
aspired
to
waging
regular
war
and
did
not
confine
themselves
to
blocking
the
roads
or
intercepting
couriers
and
convoys
the
empecinado
whose
sphere
of
activity
lay
on
the
borders
of
old
and
new
castile
got
possession
of
guadalajara
for
a
day
though
he
retired
when
reinforcements
from
madrid
were
reported
to
be
approaching
somewhat
later
the
younger
mina
the
student
as
he
was
called
to
distinguish
him
from
his
more
celebrated
uncle
espoz
stormed
the
town
of
tafalla
and
shut
up
the
remains
of
its
garrison
in
its
castle
while
the
of
the
governor
of
navarre
were
seeking
him
in
every
other
direction
he
too
like
the
empecinado
had
to
seek
safety
in
retreat
and
dispersion
when
his
exploit
drew
in
upon
him
forces
sent
from
suchet
s
army
of
aragon
see

the
activity
of
the
guerrilleros
did
not
merely
constitute
a
military
danger
for
king
joseph
it
affected
him
in
another
and
an
equally
vexatious
fashion
by
cutting
off
nearly
all
his
sources
of
revenue
while
the
open
country
was
in
the
hands
of
the
insurgents
he
could
raise
neither
imposts
nor
requisitions
from
it
the
only
regular
income
that
he
could
procure
during
the
later
months
of
was
that
which
came
in
from
the
local
taxes
of
madrid
and
the
few
other
large
towns
of
which
he
was
in
secure
possession
and
save
in
the
capital
itself
his
agents
and
intendants
had
to
fight
hard
with
the
military
governors
to
secure
even
this
meagre
pittance
the
king
could
not
command
a
quarter
of
the
sum
which
he
required
to
pay
the
ordinary
expenses
of
government
his
courtiers
and
ministers
french
and
spanish
failed
to
receive
their
salaries
and
the
spanish
army
which
he
was
busily
striving
to
form
could
not
be
clothed
or
armed
much
less
paid
nothing
vexed
joseph
more
than
this
he
wished
to
make
himself
independent
of
his
brother
s
generals
by
raising
a
large
force
of
his
own
which
should
be
at
his
personal
disposition
he
formed
the
of
regiment
after
regiment
and
filled
them
with
deserters
from
the
foreign
troops
of
the
junta
and
with
any
prisoners
who
could
be
induced
to
enlist
under
his
banners
in
order
to
avoid
transportation
to
france
but
the
recruits
when
sent
to
join
the
new
regiments
disappeared
for
the
most
part
within
a
few
weeks
joseph
thought
that
it
was
from
lack
of
pay
and
proper
sustenance
and
raged
at
the
idea
that
but
for
the
want
of
money
he
might
have
at
his
disposition
a
formidable
army
of
his
own
but
he
deceived
himself
the
juramentados
had
for
the
most
part
no
desire
save
to
desert
and
rejoin
their
old
colours
the
real
renegades
were
few
in
the
ranks
of
the
junta
s
army
the
soldier
was
even
worse
clothed
fed
and
paid
than
in
that
of
joseph
no
amount
of
pampering
would
have
turned
the
king
s
spanish
levies
into
loyal
servants
for
a
typical
example
of
the
relations
of
french
governors
and
the

officials

one

not
be
repeated
this
was
the
confiscation
of
property
belonging
to
all
persons
who
were
in
the
service
of
the
junta
and
of
all
the
religious
orders
this
would
have
given
him
vast
sums
if
only
he
could
have
found
buyers
but
it
was
not
easy
to
persuade
any
one
to
pay
ready
cash
for
lands
overrun
by
the
guerrilleros
or
for
houses
in
towns
which
were
practically
in
a
state
of
siege
and
were
also
subject
to
a
grinding
taxation
property
of
immense
value
had
to
be
alienated
for
wholly
inadequate
sums
the
whom
joseph
was
most
anxious
to
conciliate
got
such
payment
as
he
could
afford
mainly
in
the
form
of
vain
grants
of
property
which
they
could
not
turn
to
account
the
only
ready
money
which
was
in
circulation
was
that
which
came
from
the
coining
down
at
the
madrid
mint
of
the
considerable
amount
of
plate
belonging
to
the
monasteries
and
the
churches
on
which
the
king
had
laid
hands
naturally
he
was
regarded
as
a
sacrilegious
robber
by
his
unwilling
subjects
though
few
or
none
murmured
when
the
central
junta
filled
its
exchequer
by
similar
expedients
but
the
junta
had
not
decreed
the
abolition
of
the
religious
orders
it
only
purported
to
be
raising
a
patriotic
loan
from
their
resources
a
minister
of
joseph
sums
up
the
situation
sufficiently
well
in
three
sentences
spanish
public
opinion
was
inexorable
it
rejected
everything
coming
from
us
even
benefits
thus
the
king
and
his
councillors
spent
themselves
in
fruitless
labours
nothing
answered
their
expectations
and
the
void
in
the
treasury
the
worst
danger
showed
no
sign
of
diminution
on
the
contrary
the
financial
distress
increased
every
day
and
the
unpleasant
means
which
we
were
compelled
to
employ
in
order
to
supply
the
wants
of
the
army
completely
alienated
the
nation
from
us

the
orders
issued
by
the
king
and
soult
after
the
battle
of
ocaña
show
that
they
had
no
immediate
intention
of
pursuing
areizaga
s
routed
host
and
entering
andalusia
at
its
heels
tempting
though
such
a
policy
might
be
from
the
purely
military
point
of
view
after
victor
and
the
corps
had
joined
him
on
the
day
following
the
battle
joseph
had
nearly
men
in
hand
but
his
first
move
was
to
disperse
this
formidable
army
gazan
s
division
of
mortier
s
corps
was
at
once
hurried
off
towards
the
north
to
reinforce
kellermann
in
leon
for
the
battle
of
alba
de
tormes
had
not
yet
taken
place
and
it
was
thought
that
the
corps
needed
prompt
assistance
laval
s
division
of
sebastiani
s
corps
was
detached
in
another
direction
being
told
off
to
escort
to
madrid
and
afterwards
to
burgos
and
vittoria
the
vast
mass
of
prisoners
taken
at
ocaña
milhaud
with
his
own
dragoons
and
an
infantry
brigade
taken
from
sebastiani
s
corps
was
directed
to
push
eastwards
by
way
of
tarancon
and
then
to
march
on
cuenca
where
it
was
reported
that
many
of
the
fugitives
from
areizaga
s
army
had
rallied
the
brigade
of
dessolles
division
which
had
been
present
at
ocaña
and
joseph
s
own
troops
returned
to
madrid
in
company
with
their
master
when
the
capital
was
again
adequately
garrisoned
numerous
were
sent
out
from
it
to
clear
the
roads
and
disperse
the
guerrilleros
mortier
with
that
part
of
the
corps
which
had
not
been
detached
under
gazan
was
drawn
back
to
toledo
thus
of
all
the
troops
which
had
been
concentrated
on
november
only
victor
s
corps
and
the
polish
division
with
the
cavalry
brigade
of
the
corps
were
retained
in
la
mancha
facing
the
sierra
morena
the
corps
was
pushed
forward
to
ciudad
real
and
its
neighbourhood
with
its
advanced
cavalry
watching
the
passes
the
poles
remained
at
ocaña
and
la
guardia
with
perreymond
s
three
regiments
of
light
horse
in
front
of
them
at
madridejos
for
all
these
details
see
soult
s
dispatches
to
the
minister
of
war
at
paris
dated
and
from
aranjuez
and
madrid
perreymond
had
received
the
cavalry
brigade
of
the
corps
when
paris
fell
in
action
in
the
dispatch
which
detailed
to
the
minister
of
war
at
paris
this
disposition
of
the
army
soult
explained
his
reasons
for
holding
back
it
was
a
more
pressing
necessity
to
restore
order
in
the
provinces
of
the
interior
than
to
pursue
the
wrecks
of
areizaga
s
force
which
was
so
completely
dispersed
that
no
further
danger
need
be
feared
from
it
before
undertaking
any
large
general
scheme
of
operation
the
king
thought
it
best
to
consult
his
imperial
brother
as
to
his
wishes
it
was
rumoured
that
napoleon
himself
might
appear
on
the
scene
within
a
few
weeks
and
it
was
certain
that
the
first
columns
of
reinforcements
from
germany
which
might
prove
to
be
the
heralds
of
his
approach
were
just
about
to
cross
the
bidassoa
moreover
it
would
be
prudent
to
discover
what
had
become
of
albuquerque
and
of
the
english
before
any
great
move
to
the
southward
was
made
as
also
to
make
an
end
of
the
army
of
del
parque
by
means
of
the
reinforcements
which
had
just
been
sent
to
kellermann
soult
to
clarke

les
opérations

devront
être
the
entirely
false
supposition
that
albuquerque
and
the
english
were
on
the
move
was
as
soult
afterwards
explained
due
to
a
dispatch
received
from
heudelet
at
talavera
who
sent
in
an
alarming
report
that
wellington
was
expected
at
truxillo
in
a
few
days
as
to
the
idea
that
del
parque
might
join
albuquerque
the
junta
had
actually
given
him
an
order
to
do
so
see
page
but
he
had
ignored
it
and
marched
on
salamanca
within
three
weeks
the
situation
had
changed
and
many
of
the
reasons
which
had
induced
the
king
and
soult
to
adopt
a
waiting
policy
had
disappeared
on
november
as
we
have
already
seen
kellermann
routed
del
parque
at
alba
de
tormes
though
he
had
not
yet
received
the
succours
which
gazan
was
bringing
up
to
his
aid
the
army
of
the
left
being
no
longer
a
source
of
danger
kellermann
not
only
sent
orders
to
gazan
who
had
reached
segovia
to
return
to
new
castile
since
he
was
no
longer
wanted
in
the
north
but
presently
sent
back
to
the
king
rey
s
brigade
of
dessolles
division
which
had
been
lent
him
early
in
november
thus
men
who
had
been
detached
came
back
under
the
king
s
control
and
were
once
more
available
for
offensive
operations
at
the
new
year
gazan
had
men
present
with
the
eagles
rey
see
tables
at
the
end
of
this
volume
still
more
important
was
the
fact
that
in
the
first
days
of
december
the
reinforcements
from
germany
had
at
last
begun
to
cross
the
pyrenees
and
were
arriving
in
navarre
and
biscay
in
enormous
numbers
two
strong
divisions
commanded
by
loison
and
reynier
and
counting
more
than
bayonets
had
already
appeared
and
the
head
of
the
interminable
column
which
followed
them
had
reached
bayonne
it
was
certain
that
at
least
men
were
on
the
march
to
fill
up
the
void
in
old
castile
which
had
been
causing
the
king
and
soult
so
much
trouble
the
roads
would
soon
be
cleared
the
isolated
garrisons
relieved
and
the
communications
with
madrid
made
safe
the
newly
arrived
generals
had
received
orders
to
sweep
every
valley
on
their
southward
march
and
to
disperse
every
band
of
guerrilleros
another
possible
source
of
danger
which
had
preoccupied
the
minds
of
joseph
and
his
after
ocaña
had
also
been
removed
the
english
had
made
no
forward
movement
towards
the
tagus
they
were
reported
to
be
still
quiescent
at
badajoz
and
rumours
which
afterwards
turned
out
to
be
correct
had
already
reached
the
french
head
quarters
to
the
effect
that
wellington
was
just
about
to
retire
into
portugal
moreover
milhaud
s
expedition
to
tarancon
and
cuenca
and
the
excursions
of
the
sent
out
from
madrid
had
all
proved
successful
the
insurgents
had
been
dispersed
with
ease
wherever
they
had
been
met
with
see
orders
for
loison
in
napoleon
to
berthier
of
and
for
reynier
in
napoleon
to
berthier
in
the
reynier
was
superseded
by
lagrange
and
sent
to
command
the
corps
a
little
later
of
all
the
reasons
for
delay
which
were
valid
on
november
there
was
now
none
left
unremoved
save
the
most
important
of
all
the
emperor
had
not
yet
made
his
intentions
known
though
pressed
to
declare
his
will
by
every
letter
sent
by
his
brother
or
by
soult
he
gave
no
answer
as
to
a
general
plan
of
campaign
several
of
his
dispatches
had
reached
madrid
they
were
full
of
details
as
to
the
troops
which
he
was
sending
across
the
pyrenees
they
contained
some
advice
as
to
finance
and
some
rebukes
for
the
king
concerning
petty
matters
of
administration
but
there
was
no
permission
still
less
any
order
to
invade
andalusia
or
portugal
nor
did
napoleon
deign
to
state
that
he
was
or
was
not
coming
to
spain
in
person
it
was
only
when
joseph
received
the
first
dispatch
opening
up
the
matter
of
the
divorce
of
josephine
that
he
was
able
to
guess
that
with
such
an
affair
on
hand
his
brother
would
not
set
out
for
the
peninsula
during
the
winter
or
the
early
spring
the
emperor
scolds
his
brother
for
not
sending
to
paris
the
flags
taken
at
ocaña
and
for
calling
sebastiani
s
division
the
polish
division
instead
of
the
division
of
the
grand
duchy
of
warsaw
in
a
dispatch
dated
from
the
trianon
on
by
the
middle
of
december
joseph
had
made
up
his
mind
that
it
would
be
politic
to
attack
andalusia
without
delay
he
had
won
over
soult
to
his
ideas
the
marshal
having
now
abandoned
the
plan
which
he
had
urged
so
strongly
in
the
autumn
that
lisbon
not
seville
should
be
the
objective
of
the
next
french
advance
it
is
easy
to
understand
the
king
s
point
of
view
he
wished
rather
to
complete
the
conquest
of
his
own
realm
by
subduing
its
wealthiest
and
most
populous
province
than
to
do
his
brother
s
work
in
portugal
where
he
had
no
personal
interest
it
is
less
obvious
why
soult
concurred
with
him
as
a
great
strategist
he
should
have
envisaged
the
situation
from
the
military
rather
than
the
political
point
of
view
apparently
joseph
had
won
him
over
by
giving
him
all
that
he
asked
and
treating
him
with
effusive
courtesy
their
old
quarrels
of
the
preceding
summer
had
been
entirely
forgotten
at
any
rate
soult
had
now
become
the
ardent
advocate
of
the
invasion
of
andalusia
though
as
his
predecessor
jourdan
tersely
puts
it
the
english
army
being
now
the
only
organized
force
in
a
state
to
face
the
imperial
troops
and
its
presence
in
the
peninsula
being
the
thing
that
sustained
the
spanish
government
and
gave
confidence
to
the
spanish
people
i
imagine
that
we
ought
to
have
set
ourselves
to
destroy
that
army
rather
than
to
have
disseminated
our
troops
in
garrisoning
the
whole
surface
of
spain
the
same
thought
was
in
the
emperor
s
mind
when
he
wrote
in
january
too
late
to
stop
the
andalusian
expedition
that
the
only
danger
in
spain
is
the
english
army
the
rest
are
partisans
who
can
never
hold
the
field
against
us
jourdan
napoleon
to
berthier
giving
directions
which
could
not
be
carried
out
because
the
invasion
of
andalusia
had
begun
ten
days
before
the
dispatch
had
been
written
on
the
of
december
soult
at
last
made
a
formal
appeal
in
a
dispatch
to
berthier
for
leave
to
commence
the
march
on
seville
at
no
time
since
the
spanish
war
began
he
wrote
have
circumstances
been
so
favourable
for
invading
andalusia
and
it
is
probable
that
such
a
movement
would
have
the
most
advantageous
results
i
have
already
informed
your
excellency
that
preparations
would
be
made
for
this
movement
while
we
waited
for
his
majesty
to
deign
to
make
known
to
us
his
supreme
soult
adds
that
if
only
loison
s
division
of
the
reinforcements
may
be
brought
up
to
burgos
and
a
second
division
sent
to
saragossa
in
order
to
free
suchet
for
field
service
the
invasion
can
be
begun
as
soon
as
the
army
in
new
castile
has
completed
its
equipment
and
received
its
drafts
no
direct
reply
was
received
to
this
dispatch
nor
to
several
subsequent
communications
in
which
soult
and
joseph
set
forth
the
arrangements
which
they
were
making
always
subject
to
the
imperial
approval
for
concentrating
an
army
for
the
andalusian
expedition
strange
as
it
may
appear
it
was
only
in
a
letter
written
on
january
when
the
king
had
already
crossed
the
sierra
morena
that
napoleon
vouchsafed
a
word
concerning
the
problem
it
is
clear
that
he
had
ample
time
to
have
stopped
it
if
such
had
been
his
will
the
ultimate
responsibility
therefore
lay
with
him
but
he
refrained
from
ordering
it
or
from
approving
it
thus
reserving
to
himself
all
the
possibilities
of
criticism
since
no
prohibition
came
joseph
made
up
his
mind
to
strike
it
was
natural
that
he
should
be
fascinated
by
the
idea
of
conquering
in
person
the
one
great
province
of
spain
which
remained
intact
a
brilliant
campaign
in
which
he
would
figure
as
as
well
as
king
might
at
last
convince
the
spaniards
of
his
capacity
he
was
prepared
to
play
the
part
of
a
merciful
and
generous
conqueror
at
the
worst
the
revenues
of
the
wealthy
andalusia
would
be
a
godsend
to
his
depleted
treasury
soult
writes
plaintively
to

from
madrid
on
january
le

croit
ne
pouvoir

met

d

de

lorsque
sa

soit
passée
les
ordres

demandés
depuis
plus
d

seront
but
the
order
never
came
two
plans
were
drawn
up
for
the
invasion
the
first
was
more
cautious
and
more
consonant
with
the
strict
rules
of
strategy
the
second
was
bolder
and
promised
more
immediate
results
according
to
the
first
the
king
was
to
concentrate
his
main
army
in
la
mancha
and
to
threaten
the
passes
while
two
great
flanking
columns
carried
out
the
preliminary
conquest
of
estremadura
and
valencia
mortier
was
to
march
with
the
and
corps
upon
badajoz
to
crush
albuquerque
and
to
occupy
the
valley
of
the
guadiana
simultaneously
suchet
was
to
make
a
push
from
aragon
into
valencia
with
the
bulk
of
his
corps
while
his
place
at
saragossa
was
to
be
taken
by
a
large
force
drawn
from
the
reinforcements
from
france
only
when
badajoz
and
valencia
had
fallen
and
suchet
and
mortier
could
advance
parallel
with
him
on
either
flank
was
the
king
to
march
against
seville
the
weak
point
of
the
scheme
was
that
either
badajoz
or
valencia
might
make
a
long
resistance
if
their
garrisons
fought
like
that
of
gerona
the
central
advance
on
andalusia
might
be
delayed
for
an
indefinite
time
the
second
plan
the
one
that

the

operations
in
the

nearly
the
whole

to
concentrate

from
thence
to
strike
straight
at

the
difficult
and
passes
of

sebastiani
with
no
more
than
a
single
infantry

and
milhaud

was
to
demonstrate
against
the
main
group
of

in

along
the
line
of

as
to
distract
the
attention

route
via

villanueva
de

adamuz
the
spanish
centre
would
undoubtedly
be
broken
and
it
was
probable
that
cordova
seville

cadiz
would
be
carried
by
the
first
rush
for

would
be
cut
off

towards

it
may
be
found
set
forth
in
full
in
soult
s
dispatch
to
berthier
of
the
plan
an
admirable
one
from
the
point
of
view
of
strategy
had
to
be
abandoned
for
it
was
found
that
the
country
between
almaden
and
cordova
was
so
absolutely
barren
and
uninhabited
and
the
roads
so
bad
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
carry
a
very
large
body
of
troops
across
it
at
it
was
doubtful
whether
the
passes
were
practicable
for
artillery
it
was
certain
that
no
food
could
be
obtained
and
the
train
required
to
carry
rations
for
men
would
be
so
large
and
heavy
that
it
would
probably
stick
fast
in
the
mountains
on
january
when
mortier
dessolles
and
the
rest
of
the
army
had
already
moved
out
of
their
cantonments
and
taken
the
road
for
la
mancha
the
revised
draft
of
the
plan
of
campaign
was
issued
it
was
inferior
in
unity
of
conception
to
the
first
plan
and
did
not
seem
likely
to
produce
such
good
results
but
it
had
the
merit
of
being
practicable
by
this
scheme
victor
alone
was
to
march
on
cordova
with
the
men
of
the
corps
he
was
to
endeavour
to
take
his
artillery
with
him
but
if
the
passes
proved
too
rough
he
was
to
send
it
back
by
almaden
to
join
the
main
army
mortier
dessolles
sebastiani
milhaud
and
the
king
s
reserves
were
to
strike
at
the
group
of
passes
in
front
of
la
carolina
and
to
drive
the
spaniards
out
of
them
it
was
hoped
that
they
would
thrust
areizaga
s
host
into
the
arms
of
victor
who
would
be
descending
into
the
valley
of
the
guadalquivir
just
in
time
to
meet
the
enemy
retiring
from
the
defiles
for
this
operation
the
king
was
to
take
with
him
rather
more
than
men
it
may
be
remarked
that
this
plan
divided
the
french
army
into
two
separate
columns
entirely
destitute
of
lateral
communications
and
that
if
the
spaniards
had
been
stronger
considerable
danger
would
have
been
incurred
areizaga
might
have
concentrated
every
man
against
one
or
other
of
the
columns
and
have
brought
it
to
a
stand
while
merely
observing
the
other
but
to
do
so
he
would
have
required
a
far
larger
force
than
he
actually
possessed
he
had
as
we
have
seen
only
men
under
arms
and
even
if
he
collected
every
available
bayonet
in
one
mass
either
half
of
the
french
army
was
strong
enough
to
meet
and
to
beat
him
the
king
therefore
was
running
no
real
risk
when
he
divided
up
his
troops
as
a
matter
of
fact
areizaga
had
made
matters
easy
for
the
enemy
by
splitting
his
small
and
dilapidated
host
into
three
sections
zerain

conferred
with

and
in
consequence
of
his
reports
concerning
the
state
of
the
passes
in
the
direction
of
cordova
recast
their
plans
and
adopted
the
scheme
of
operations
which
has
just
been
detailed
on
the
following
day
victor
and
his
corps
marched
from
ciudad
real
for
almaden

carry
out

great
turning

days
to
allow

to
get
far

on
his
rugged
route
and
only
on
the
started
out
to
deliver
the
frontal
attack
on
the
and
the
other
passes
in
front
of
la
carolina
it
may
be
mentioned
that
joseph
had
left
behind
him
to
garrison
madrid
the
french
division
of
the
corps
and
not
dessolles
troops
who
had
been
wont
to
occupy
the
capital
during
the
earlier
operations
both
dessolles
and
joseph
s
own
reserves
his
royal
guard
and
a
strong
brigade
of
his
spanish
army
joined
in
the
invasion
since
the
german
division
of
the
corps
was
still
absent
escorting
the
prisoners
of
ocaña
it
resulted
that
sebastiani
had
with
him
only
his
polish
division
his
cavalry
and
some
details
sufficient
to
muster
up
a
total
of
just
men
his
corps
was
never
properly
reassembled
during
the
whole
of
the
rest
of
the
war
as
some
of
the
regiments
which
he
now
left
behind
never
rejoined
him
in
andalusia
but
were
left
in
garrison
in
new
castile

and
practically
became
part
of
the
army

the
with
the
exception
of
the
regiment
which
went
on
with
sebastiani
to
the
front
besides
the
garrison
of
madrid
joseph
left
to
cover
his
rear
the
whole
corps
still
under
the
provisional
command
of
heudelet
which
lay
at
talavera
and
was
charged
to
watch
albuquerque
if
the
rumour
of
the
departure
of
the
english
from
badajoz
were
true
there
would
be
no
danger
in
this
quarter
but
joseph
was
not
yet
quite
certain
that
wellington
had
retired
into
portugal
the
only
serious
preoccupation
which
vexed
his
mind
at
the
moment
when
he
was
preparing
to
attack
was
the
idea
that
the
english
might
still
come
up
by
truxillo
and
join
albuquerque
in
a
raid
on
madrid
heudelet
the
constant
purveyor
of
false
information
did
his
best
to
scare
his
master
on
january
by
sending
him
a
report
that
wellington
was
still
at
badajoz
with
men
but
later
and
more
trustworthy
news
from
other
quarters
showing
that
the
english
army
had
marched
off
for
abrantes
long
before
christmas
at
last
set
the
king
s
mind
at
rest
on
this
topic
heudelet
writing
from
talavera
on
assured
the
king
that
he
had
certain
information
by
english
deserters
that
wellington
s
army
foot
and
cavalry
was
at
merida
badajoz
and
elvas
on
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
army
had
marched
off
between
and
and
wellington
himself
had
retired
into
portugal
on
christmas
eve
on
the
day
when
heudelet
wrote
he
and
his
head
quarters
were
at
vizeu
in
the
beira
there
was
nothing
to
be
feared
from
the
west
when
wellington
had
taken
his
departure
albuquerque
s
small
force
was
powerless
and
if
del

moved
down
from
the
sierra
de
francia
into
the
valley
of
the
tagus
the
corps
could
make
a
corresponding
movement
ney

now
returned
to
take
command
at
salamanca

the
confidence
of
his

began
to
receive
from

quarters
dispatches
which
left
him
no

that
the
fatal
hour
had
arrived
and
that
the
whole
of
his
line
from
villamanrique
on
the

on

was
about
to
be
assailed
by
the

from

point

lie

an
even
more
pressing

seemed
to
be
foreshadowed

vigodet

from

not

whether

demonstrations

whether

pierce

places
and
they
fled
in
haste
down
the
rear
of
the
sierra
to
escape
being
captured
by
flanking
detachments
which
were
pushing
on
at
full
speed
to
head
them
off
the
moment
that
the
was
turned
by
mortier
s
movement
the
troops
occupying
it
had
to
retreat
at
headlong
speed
just
as
girard
was
commencing
his
attack
on
them
all
did
not
retire
with
sufficient
promptness
the
battalion
in
a
redoubt
on
the
collado
de
los
jardines
on
the
right
flank
of
the
was
cut
off
and
captured
all
the
guns
in
the
pass
were
taken
there
being
no
time
to
get
them
away
down
the
steep
road
in
their
rear
after
two
hours
of
scrambling
rather
than
fighting
the
main
passages
of
the
sierra
morena
were
in
the
hands
of
the
french
the
mines
on
the
had
been
fired
when
the
retreat
was
ordered
but
did
not
wreck
the
in
such
a
way
as
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
pursuing
the
losses
of
the
spaniards
were
no
more
than
a
few
hundreds
killed
and
wounded
and
prisoners
those
of
the
french
were
less
than
in
all
there
had
in
truth
been
hardly
the
semblance
of
a
battle
soult
s
statement
that
he
lost
some
men
soult
to
berthier
is
no
doubt
a
little
exaggerated
but
martinien
s
invaluable
tables
show
that
mortier
s
corps
which
did
nearly
all
the
fighting
lost
only
officers
out
of
present
probably
therefore
it
lost
no
more
than
forty
men
dessolles
must
have
lost
about
the
same
the
full
results
of
the
disaster
were
only
developed
next
day
the
troops
which
had
defended
the
central
passes
escaped
though
in
dreadful
disorder
but
those
further
to
their
right
were
destined
to
a
worse
fate
while
mortier
and
the
king
were
forcing
the
great
defiles
sebastiani
had
been
fighting
all
day
with
vigodet
in
the
defiles
about
montizon
and
esteban
del
puerto
he
had
no
such
superiority
in
numbers
over
his
enemy
as
had
the
king
on
the
main
field
of
operations
hence
his
progress
was
slower
and
his
victory
though
complete
was
not
so
prompt
and
crushing
vigodet
and
his
men
were
dispersed
by
the
afternoon
and
fled
down
the
valley
of
the
guadalen
towards
the
plains
with
sebastiani
s
cavalry
in
pursuit
having
fought
much
longer
than
lacy
and
giron
their
losses
were
heavier
than
those
of
the
central
division
probably
killed
wounded
or
taken
shortly
after
there
appeared
on
the
scene
moving
along
the
steep
from
la
carolina
the
spanish
division
of
castejon
which
had
been
sent
off
on
the
previous
night
to
support
vigodet
it
found
the
esteban
position
in
the
possession
of
the
french
and
turned
hastily
back
to
rejoin
areizaga
but
while
it
had
been
on
the
march
the
and
his
army
had
been
routed
and
la
carolina
was
in
the
hands
of
the
french
castejon
found
himself
enclosed
between
sebastiani
and
the
king
in
a
most
perilous
position
on
the
morning
of
the
he
tried
to
escape
by
the
to
linares
but
on
arriving
near
that
place
found
that
mortier
s
troops
were
already
across
his
road
a
brigade
of
sebastiani
s
corps
was
in
hot
pursuit
in
his
rear
and
castejon
seeing
himself
thus
enclosed
surrendered
at
arquillos
with
his
whole
intact
division
of
over
men
and
ten
guns
of
his
whole
men
only
were
infantry
and
vigodet
with
the
wrecks
of
jacomé
s
division
had
nearly
as
many
already
before
the
capture
of
this
spanish
corps
the
king
and
sebastiani
had
joined
hands
their
reconnoitring
parties
having
met
in
the
valley
of
the
guadalen
on
learning
of
the
complete
success
of
both
columns
joseph
and
soult
resolved
to
urge
the
pursuit
in
two
separate
directions
sebastiani
was
told
to
push
forward
by
way
of
ubeda
and
baeza
to
jaen
while
the
main
column
marched
by
baylen
on
andujar
and
cordova
it
was
hoped
that
news
of
victor
would
soon
be
received
if
all
had
gone
well
he
would
have
reached
the
guadalquivir
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
of
cordova
so
as
to
be
in
the
rear
of
any
spanish
force
that
might
have
retreated
from
la
carolina
in
the
direction
of
seville
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
both
vigodet
and
also
areizaga
with
the
wreck
of
the
troops
from
the
central
passes
had
abandoned
any
hope
of
covering
seville
and
had
retreated
southwards
on
jaen
there
was
no
force
whatever
left
upon
the
cordova
road
and
the
king
met
no
resistance
upon
the
or
the
on
the
latter
day
sebastiani
arriving
in
front
of
jaen
found
the
spanish
with
some
or
men
prepared
to
defend
the
town
he
attacked
at
once
and
routed
these
dispirited
troops
who
made
little
or
no
show
of
resistance
practically
the
whole
force
went
to
pieces
the
french
captured
guns
mostly
those
of
the
of
the
army
of
andalusia
which
had
been
deposited
in
jaen
of
the
wrecks
of
that
unhappy
force
areizaga
carried
off
a
small
remnant
to
guadix
in
the
eastern
mountains
near
the
borders
of
murcia
lacy
with
another
fraction
retired
on
granada
but
the
large
majority
had
left
their
colours
and
dispersed
to
their
homes
king
joseph
and
soult
meanwhile
advancing
unopposed
along
the
to
cordova
and
seville
got
into
touch
at
andujar
with
the
advanced
cavalry
of
victor
on
the
night
of
the
of
january
the
march
of
the
corps
had
been
toilsome
in
the
extreme
but
almost
unopposed
save
by
the
difficulties
of
the
road
after
driving
zerain
s
little
detachment
out
of
almaden
on
the
they
had
hardly
seen
an
enemy
zerain
and
his
colleague
copons
had
retired
by
the
road
towards
seville
victor
though
he
sent
out
flying
parties
of
cavalry
to
threaten
benalcazar
and
hinojosa
to
his
right
had
really
pushed
further
to
the
left
on
the
easternmost
of
the
two
rough
passes
which
lead
to
cordova
the
day
after
leaving
almaden
he
had
sent
his
artillery
back
to
la
mancha
the
dilapidated
and
abandoned
road
to
which
he
had
committed
himself
proving
absolutely
impracticable
for
anything
that
travelled
on
wheels
but
he
pushed
on
with
his
infantry
and
horsemen
and
passing
santa
eufemia
torrecampo
and
villanueva
de
la
jara
came
down
into
the
plain
of
the
guadalquivir
at
adamuz
fifteen
miles
to
the
east
of
cordova
on
january
the
day
after
soult
and
king
joseph
had
forced
the
despeña
perros
and
the
puerto
del
rey
wishing
to
get
into
touch
with
them
before
attacking
cordova
he
halted
his
infantry
but
sent
out
his
cavalry
to
the
gates
of
that
city
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
to
montoro
and
andujar
where
they
met
the
vedettes
of
the
main
army
on
the
evening
of
the
thus
the
french
host
was
once
more
concentrated
the
march
on
seville
could
be
continued
without
delay
victor
now
became
the
advanced
guard
he
entered
cordova
which
opened
its
gates
without
resistance
on
the
there
was
no
spanish
force
in
front
of
the
french
army
since
zerain
and
copons
had
retired
towards
seville
by
a
road
far
to
the
west
while
the
wrecks
of
areizaga
s
army
had
been
driven
off
in
a
direction
soult
and
king
joseph
therefore
had
leisure
to
plan
out
the
remainder
of
their
campaign
without
any
disturbance
from
the
enemy
on
the
they
resolved
to
detach
sebastiani
and
his
men
for
the
conquest
of
granada
to
leave
dessolles
division
at
cordova
and
andujar
but
to
march
on
seville
in
a
single
mass
with
the
remaining
sabres
and
bayonets
of
the
army
of
andalusia
the
desire
to
seize
the
capital
from
which
the
junta
had
so
long
defied
him
seems
to
have
mastered
every
other
idea
in
the
mind
of
the
intrusive
king
the
rebel
government
should
be
captured
or
at
least
forced
to
take
refuge
in
portugal
or
the
sea
then
at
last
the
provinces
would
submit
the
regular
armies
would
lay
down
their
arms
the
guerrillero
bands
would
disperse
to
their
homes
and
he
might
reign
as
a
real
king
not
as
the
mere
tool
of
his
imperious
brother
the
capture
of
seville
would
be
the
last
act
but
one
of
the
drama
after
that
he
would
become
the
national
monarch
of
a
submissive
people
and
carry
out
all
the
schemes
of
vague
benevolence
on
which
his
mind
was
wont
to
dwell
in
his
more
hopeful
hours
that
the
resistance
would
continue
even
if
seville
were
his
own
and
the
junta
were
scattered
and
discredited
he
did
not
dream
and
seville
he
knew
must
fall
to
defend
it
there
could
be
as
he
concluded
nothing
but
a
mob
backed
by
the
few
thousand
dispirited
soldiers
who
had
fled
before
victor
from
the
western
section
of
the
sierra
morena
even
if
the
rebel
capital
made
itself
a
second
saragossa
he
had
at
his
disposal
an
army
double
the
strength
of
that
which
had
reduced
the
obstinate
aragonese
city
for
details
of
their
plans
see
the
dispatch
of
soult
to
berthier
from
andujar
under
the
date
of
that
day
in
subsequent
years
critics
wise
after
the
event
never
tired
of
declaiming
against
the
policy
which
joseph
and
soult
approved
on
january
it
was
easy
in
or
to
point
out
that
a
division
or
two
might
have
been
spared
from
the
victorious
army
to
execute
a
march
upon
cadiz
while
the
main
force
was
dealing
with
seville
the
which
was
to
defy
the
french
during
the
next
three
years
might
have
been
caught
while
it
was
still
ungarrisoned
and
if
only
the
invaders
had
detached
a
column
from
carmona
where
the
road
from
cordova
bifurcates
to
seville
on
the
right
and
cadiz
on
the
left
it
is
certain
that
if
any
suggestion
to
that
effect
was
made
at
the
time
soult
mortier
and
the
other
generals
present
at
the
council
of
war
passed
it
over
the
fact
was
that
seville
loomed
large
before
the
imaginations
of
them
all
cadiz
seemed
but
a
secondary
affair
at
the
moment
it
appeared
probable
that
the
whole
of
the
scattered
forces
of
the
enemy
would
mass
themselves
to
defend
the
insurgent
capital
on
january
when
the
original
plan
was
drawn
up
no
one
realized
that
there
was
a
spanish
army
approaching
whose
presence
in
andalusia
had
not
yet
become
known
or
that
the
general
of
that
army
would
deliberately
leave
seville
to
its
fate
as
incapable
of
defence
and
doomed
to
destruction
and
hasten
by
forced
marches
to
throw
himself
into
the
which
was
destined
to
become
the
new
capital
of
insurgent
spain
unable
to
foresee
such
a
development
joseph
wrote
to
his
brother
on
january
that
seville
would
probably
submit
without
fighting
and
that
he
would
then
enter
cadiz
coup
there
was
a
considerable
controversy
among
french
military
writers
as
to
whether
the
omission
to
march
on
cadiz
was
the
fault
of
soult
or
of
the
king
the
authors
of
et
having
put
all
the
blame
on
the
latter
vol
xx
page
his
friends
hastened
to
reply
his
bigarré
who
was
present
with
him
at
the
time
explicitly
says
in
his
autobiography
pp
that
the
king
raised
the
point
but
was
talked
down
by
soult
and
dessolles
miot
de
melito
ii
bears
witness
to
the
same
effect
saying
that
he
heard
soult
clinch
his
argument
by
crying
qu
on
me
réponde
de
séville
moi
je
réponds
de
both
say
that
the
final
decision
was
made
at
carmona
see
also
ducasse
s
du
roi
vii
and
pp
where
the
same
story
is
given
by
the
king
himself
albuquerque
s
operations
which
ultimately
turned
out
to
be
the
most
important
section
of
the
andalusian
campaign
need
a
word
of
explanation
it
will
be
remembered
that
early
in
january
he
had
assembled
at
don
benito
and
medellin
the
small
that
he
could
command
after
providing
the
garrison
of
badajoz
and
leaving
a
detachment
above
almaraz
to
watch
the
french
corps
it
did
not
amount
to
more
than
men
of
which
some
were
cavalry
his
position
at
don
benito
was
intended
to
protect
the
flank
of
zerain
and
copons
who
lay
to
his
right
covering
the
passes
that
lead
from
almaden
on
to
cordova
on
january
he
received
from
zerain
the
news
that
he
was
about
to
be
attacked
at
almaden
by
a
french
column
of
at
least
men
the
duke
promptly
began
to
march
eastward
to
join
his
colleague
and
reached
campanario
on
january
here
he
was
met
by
the
information
that
zerain
had
been
driven
out
of
almaden
on
the
preceding
day
and
had
drawn
back
by
benalcazar
and
hinojosa
on
to
the
seville
road
copons
from
pozo
blanco
was
retiring
in
the
same
direction
the
duke
thereupon
concluded
that
his
duty
was
to
fall
back
by
a
route
parallel
to
that
of
victor
s
advance
and
to
draw
nearer
to
seville
strengthening
himself
as
he
approached
that
city
by
zerain
s
and
copons
small
corps
accordingly
he
sent
off
three
of
his
weakest
battalions
to
strengthen
the
garrison
of
badajoz
which
was
very
small
at
the
moment
directed
his
artillery
with
a
cavalry
escort
to
take
the
good
but
circuitous
to
seville
by
merida
los
santos
and
santa
olalla
and
started
off
across
the
mountains
with
his
infantry
and
horse
marching
very
rapidly
though
the
roads
were
bad
and
the
days
short
he
moved
by
zalamea
and
maguilla
to
guadalcanal
on
the
borders
of
andalusia
which
he
reached
on
january
here
he
received
from
the
central
junta
an
absurd
order
apparently
based
on
the
idea
that
he
was
still
at
campanario
which
bade
him
stop
victor
s
advance
by
falling
on
his
flank
and
rear
by
the
road
to
agudo
and
almaden
but
since
the
marshal
had
seized
almaden
on
the
and
was
known
to
have
moved
southward
from
thence
it
was
clear
that
he
must
now
be
more
than
to
cordova
if
the
army
of
estremadura
plunged
back
into
the
mountains
to
seek
agudo
and
almaden
it
would
only
reach
them
on
the
or
and
victor
would
be
at
the
gates
of
cordova
on
the
the
junta
s
order
was
so
hopelessly
impracticable
that
the
duke
took
upon
himself
to
disobey
it
and
wrote
in
reply
that
he
should
move
so
as
to
place
himself
between
victor
and
seville
and
would
cover
the
andalusian
capital
so
far
as
was
possible
with
the
small
force
at
his
accordingly
albuquerque
instead
of
returning
northward
into
the
estremaduran
mountains
moved
a
stage
further
south
to
el
pedroso
on
the
road
from
guadalcanal
to
seville
and
sent
orders
to
copons
and
zerain
to
join
him
with
their
small
divisions
two
days
later
he
received
the
order
which
should
have
been
sent
him
on
the
instead
of
the
insane
directions
that
were
actually
given
by
it
he
was
directed
to
march
on
seville
with
all
speed
on
the
therefore
he
arrived
at
the
ferry
of
cantillana
twenty
miles
north
of
seville
here
he
received
news
that
his
artillery
and
its
escort
had
safely
completed
its
round
and
were
about
to
cross
the
guadalquivir
at
rinconada
fifteen
miles
to
the
south
at
cantillana
however
the
duke
got
the
last
dispatch
which
the
central
junta
ever
issued
it
was
dated
on
the
a
few
hours
before
the
members
dispersed
and
fled
by
this
he
was
directed
to
march
not
on
seville
but
on
cordova
which
at
the
moment
the
document
came
to
hand
the
morning
of
the
had
just
been
occupied
by
victor
that
day
albuquerque
crossed
the
guadalquivir
and
occupied
carmona
where
he
was
joined
by
his
artillery
and
by
part
of
copons
division
but
not
apparently
by
zerain
s
which
had
retired
into
seville
he
had
now
about
men
of
whom
were
horsemen
and
guns
from
carmona
he
threw
out
a
cavalry
screen
on
all
sides
his
vedettes
on
the
struck
french
cavalry
at
ecija
and
were
driven
in
they
reported
that
the
enemy
was
advancing
in
enormous
force
from
cordova
as
was
indeed
the
case
meanwhile
news
had
come
up
from
seville
that
the
junta
had
fled
on
the
night
of
the
that
anarchy
reigned
in
the
city
and
that
a
new
revolutionary
government
had
been
installed
there
was
no
longer
any
legitimate
executive
from
which
orders
could
be
received
albuquerque
had
to
make
up
his
mind
whether
he
would
retire
into
seville
and
put
himself
at
the
disposition
of
the
mob
and
its
leaders
or
whether
he
should
seek
some
safer
base
of
operations
without
a
moment
s
hesitation
he
resolved
to
leave
the
andalusian
capital
to
itself
and
to
retire
on
cadiz
which
he
knew
to
be
ungarrisoned
yet
to
be
absolutely
impregnable
if
it
were
properly
held
this
wise
resolution
it
may
be
said
without
hesitation
saved
the
cause
of
spain
in
the
south
if
cadiz
had
been
left
unoccupied
there
would
have
been
no
further
resistance
in
andalusia
but
we
must
return
to
the
operations
of
the
french
on
the
victor
had
advanced
from
cordova
taking
the
direct
road
to
seville
via
la
carlota
and
ecija
while
mortier
and
the
royal
guard
followed
him
at
short
intervals
the
duke
of
belluno
occupied
ecija
on
the
and
carmona
on
the
on
these
two
days
his
advanced
guard
got
into
contact
with
albuquerque
s
cavalry
screen
and
learnt
from
prisoners
that
the
army
of
estremadura
whose
presence
in
andalusia
thus
became
known
was
in
front
of
them
on
reaching
carmona
victor
obtained
the
still
more
important
news
that
albuquerque
after
staying
in
that
place
for
two
days
had
not
retired
into
seville
as
might
have
been
expected
but
had
marched
southward
to
utrera
on
the
road
to
cadiz
leaving
the
greater
city
uncovered
on
the
night
of
the
the
leading
division
of
victor
s
corps
the
dragoons
of
appeared
in
front
of
seville
and
reported
that
works
were
being
hastily
thrown
up
around
it
on
all
sides
and
that
they
had
been
fired
on
by
masses
of
armed
irregulars
at
every
point
where
they
had
pushed
forward
vedettes
towards
its
suburbs
see
soult
to
berthier
from
carmona
soult
in
his
dispatch
of
says
that
the
advanced
guard
of
the
corps
appeared
before
seville
au
on
the
but
the
spanish
authorities
give
the
evening
of
the
as
the
true
date
and
seem
to
be
correct
possibly
soult
is
speaking
of
the
first
solid
force
of
infantry
and
does
not
count
the
cavalry
as
a
real
advanced
guard
but
only
as
a
reconnoitring
force
as
was
at
carmona
on
the
it
seems
certain
that
he
must
have
reached
seville
eighteen
miles
only
from
carmona
on
the
not
the
napier
ii
seems
unjust
to
the
arrangements
of
the
king
and
soult
when
he
writes
from
andujar
to
seville
is
only
miles
and
the
french
took
ten
days
to
traverse
them
a
tardiness
for
which
there
appears
no
adequate
he
then
attributes
it
to
king
joseph
s
wish
to
make
spectacular
entries
and
to
display
his
benevolence
to
the
andalusian
towns
but
the
facts
are
wrong
joseph
reached
andujar
late
on
victor
s
cavalry
was
in
front
of
seville
on
this
makes
seven
not
ten
days
and
the
distance
by
the
direct
road
via
ecija
and
carmona
is
not
but
miles
a
rate
of
eighteen
miles
a
day
is
no
bad
record
for
an
army
advancing
through
a
hostile
country
even
if
it
is
meeting
with
no
actual
resistance
and
january
days
are
short
with
sunrise
late
and
sunset
early
seville
was
at
this
moment
and
had
been
now
for
six
days
in
a
state
of
chaos
the
central
junta
had
absconded
on
the
taking
along
with
it
both
its
executive
committee
and
the
ministers
of
state
the
panic
had
begun
on
the
when
the
news
had
come
in
that
victor
s
corps
had
thrust
zerain
out
of
almaden
three
days
before
and
was
marching
on
cordova
it
had
grown
worse
two
days
later
when
areizaga
reported
that
another
french
army
was
marching
against
the
the
junta
published
a
proclamation
on
the
exhorting
the
andalusians
to
have
no
fear
for
albuquerque
had
been
directed
to
fall
on
victor
s
flank
and
del
parque
with
the
army
of
castile
was
on
the
march
to
join
him
so
that
the
enemy
would
be
forced
to
turn
back
to
guard
himself
such
orders
were
indeed
sent
but
any
man
of
sense
could
see
that
they
must
arrive
too
late
if
victor
was
at
almaden
on
the
he
might
be
at
cordova
on
the
if
king
joseph
was
at
the
foot
of
the
passes
on
the
he
might
be
across
them
on
the
what
use
therefore
would
be
a
summons
sent
to
albuquerque
in
estremadura
or
to
del
parque
in
the
mountains
between
bejar
and
ciudad
rodrigo
the
french
would
be
in
the
valley
of
the
guadalquivir
long
before
del
parque
had
even
received
his
orders
to
move
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
general
got
his
dispatch
on
january
the
day
that
victor
entered
cordova
and
even
albuquerque
was
informed
of
the
junta
s
behests
only
on
the
when
he
reached
guadalcanal
the
obvious
ineptitude
which
the
government
had
shown
and
the
imminent
peril
to
which
seville
was
exposed
gave
another
chance
to
the
local
conspirators
who
had
already
twice
prepared
a
against
the
junta
on
the
riots
broke
out
and
demagogues
were
preaching
at
every
street
corner
the
necessity
for
deposing
these
incapable
rulers
and
substituting
for
them
a
regency
of
true
patriots
and
a
committee
of
public
safety
which
should
show
the
energy
in
which
the
junta
had
been
so
lacking
the
people
clamoured
at
the
doors
of
the
arsenal
asking
for
muskets
and
cannon
they
mustered
outside
the
prisons
where
palafox
montijo
and
other
chiefs
who
had
been
arrested
for
their
earlier
plots
were
still
confined
many
of
the
members
of
the
junta
left
seville
on
this
and
the
following
day
on
the
plausible
pretext
that
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
betake
themselves
to
cadiz
which
by
a
decree
of
had
been
designated
as
the
of
the
approaching
national
cortes
in
order
to
make
preparations
for
the
meeting
of
that
august
assembly
indeed
the
junta
had
been
directed
to
meet
at
cadiz
on
february
for
that
purpose
the
news
that
king
joseph
had
forced
the
passes
of
the
sierra
morena
which
came
to
hand
early
on
the
sufficed
to
make
an
end
of
any
shadow
of
power
which
the
junta
still
possessed
next
day
those
members
who
had
hitherto
stuck
to
their
post
and
the
ministers
left
the
town
with
elaborately
contrived
secrecy
seville
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
mob
who
led
by
a
capuchin
friar
riding
on
a
mule
and
brandishing
a
crucifix
burst
open
the
prisons
and
the
arsenal
armed
themselves
and
nominated
a
new
supreme
national
its
executive
was
to
be
composed
of
palafox
and
montijo
the
marquis
of
la
romana
general
eguia
and
francisco
saavedra
an
aged
and
respectable
person
who
had
been
president
of
the
old
junta
of
seville
the
original
committee
which
had
been
suppressed
by
the
central
junta
he
is
said
to
have
been
used
as
a
mere
tool
by
palafox
and
montijo
and
to
have
been
disgusted
by
their
acts
this
new
and
obviously
illegal
government
issued
decrees
stigmatizing
the
fugitive
centralists
as
cowards
and
traitors
and
claiming
authority
not
only
over
andalusia
but
over
all
spain
they
ordered
the
calling
out
of
the
levy
and
issued
commissions
displacing
generals
and
governors
in
all
the
provinces
one
of
these
documents
declared
del
parque
removed
from
the
command
of
the
army
of
the
left
and
named
la
romana
as
his
successor
the
marquis
glad
to
escape
from
the
tumult
rode
off
at
once
presented
himself
at
the
head
quarters
of
the
castilian
army
and
was
recognized
without
difficulty
as
its
chief
though
his
authority
might
well
have
been
contested
if
any
general
had
chosen
to
take
up
the
cause
of
the
discredited
central
junta
but
that
unhappy
body
had
no
longer
a
single
friend
its
members
were
mobbed
and
arrested
on
their
flight
from
seville
to
cadiz
its
president
the
archbishop
of
laodicea
its
the
conde
de
altamira
and
the
war
minister
cornel
were
seized
at
xeres
by
a
frantic
mob
and
would
have
been
murdered
if
general
castaños
whom
the
junta
had
treated
so
badly
in
december
had
not
arrived
in
time
to
save
their
lives
members
reached
cadiz
and
there
by
a
proclamation
dated
january
abdicated
their
authority
and
nominated
a
regency
to
which
they
resigned
their
power
and
the
duty
of
receiving
and
welcoming
the
expected
cortes
the
regents
were
castaños
the
bishop
of
orense
admiral
escaño
saavedra
the
president
of
the
new
and
illegal
junta
at
seville
and
fernandez
de
leon
an
american
who
was
to
represent
the
colonies
it
will
be
noted
that
the
nominators
were
wise
enough
to
refrain
from
appointing
any
of
their
own
number
to
serve
in
the
regency
after
a
very
short
tenure
of
office
fernandez
de
leon
was
superseded
by
lardizabal
another
american
meanwhile
the
duty
of
resisting
the
first
shock
of
the
french
advance
fell
not
on
the
regency
but
on
the
revolutionary
government
which
had
installed
itself
in
power
at
seville
these
usurpers
proved
themselves
quite
as
incapable
as
the
men
whom
they
had
superseded
when
once
in
possession
of
power
palafox
and
his
friends
had
to
count
up
their
resources
they
had
at
their
disposal
an
armed
mob
of
men
and
a
mere
handful
of
regular
troops
consisting
of
the
regiments
which
had
served
as
the
guards
of
the
late
junta
and
four
or
five
isolated
battalions
from
the
division
of
zerain
which
had
finally
sought
refuge
in
seville
these
troops
seem
to
have
been
about
strong
at
the
most
there
was
an
immense
quantity
of
artillery
from
the
arsenal
it
had
been
dragged
out
to
line
the
new
earthworks
on
which
the
populace
was
busily
engaged
but
not
two
hundred
trained
gunners
existed
to
man
the
batteries
it
was
hoped
that
albuquerque
s
estremaduran
army
would
come
to
their
aid
but
as
we
have
already
seen
the
duke
deliberately
refused
to
acknowledge
the
authority
of
the
seville
junta
and
instead
of
falling
back
upon
the
city
marched
southwards
to
utrera
on
the
cadiz
road
leaving
the
great
open
to
the
french
it
is
difficult
to
make
out
what
precisely
were
the
battalions
in
seville
on
january
but
they
certainly
included
a
battalion
of
the
walloon
guards
the
junta
s
old
guard
with
and
of
españa
and
barbastro
from
zerain
s
division
it
is
almost
certain
that
most
of
zerain
s
other
battalions
were
with
these
three
on
the
the
leaders
of
the
junta
having
taken
stock
of
their
position
and
discovered
its
danger
for
the
lines
which
the
people
had
thrown
up
would
have
required
men
to
man
them
and
not
half
that
force
was
forthcoming
even
if
every
rioter
armed
with
a
musket
was
counted
copied
in
the
most
ignominious
fashion
the
prudence
or
cowardice
of
the
central
junta
which
they
had
so
fiercely
denounced
five
days
before
under
the
cover
of
the
night
eguia
montijo
saavedra
and
palafox
absconded
from
seville
without
taking
leave
of
their
followers
saavedra
fled
to
cadiz
where
it
is
surprising
to
find
that
he
was
made
a
member
of
the
new
regency
palafox
to
albuquerque
s
camp
montijo
to
the
southern
mountains
where
as
he
announced
he
was
intending
to
collect
an
army
of
succour
for
seville
when
therefore
on
the
next
evening
s
dragoons
appeared
before
the
entrenchments
of
the
city
there
was
no
longer
any
responsible
government
to
turn
the
ardour
of
the
multitude
to
account
nevertheless
mobs
headed
by
frantic
friars
ran
to
the
entrenchments
and
discharged
musketry
and
at
every
french
vedette
that
showed
itself
on
the
afternoon
of
the
victor
appeared
to
reinforce
s
cavalry
bringing
with
him
the
bulk
of
the
infantry
of
the
corps
the
king
soult
and
mortier
were
close
behind
on
this
day
it
had
been
settled
at
a
held
at
carmona
that
the
whole
of
the
army
should
march
on
seville
leaving
cadiz
alone
for
the
present
and
detaching
only
a
brigade
of
cavalry
to
pursue
the
army
of
albuquerque
on
the
next
morning
victor
received
assurances
from
persons
who
had
escaped
from
the
city
that
it
was
doubtful
whether
he
would
be
opposed
since
the
mob
was
at
the
flight
of
its
leaders
and
the
senior
military
officers
were
convinced
that
resistance
was
impossible
certain
that
the
defence
would
be
feeble
if
any
were
offered
soult
gave
orders
that
the
corps
should
storm
the
lines
on
february
but
no
military
operations
were
necessary
on
the
evening
of
january
the
corporation
of
seville
had
sent
out
a
deputation
to
negotiate
for
surrender
they
offered
to
admit
the
enemy
if
they
were
guaranteed
security
of
life
and
property
for
all
who
should
submit
and
a
promise
that
no
extraordinary
should
be
levied
on
their
city
to
this
the
king
who
was
anxious
to
enter
the
place
as
a
pacific
conqueror
without
storm
or
bloodshed
gave
an
eager
consent
while
the
civil
authorities
were
treating
with
victor
the
small
body
of
regular
troops
in
seville
under
the
visconde
de
gand
quietly
left
the
place
by
the
bridge
leading
to
the
western
side
of
the
guadalquivir
and
retreated
in
haste
toward
the
condado
de
niebla
and
the
borders
of
portugal
dessolles
division
had
been
left
behind
at
cordova
and
andujar
to
garrison
upper
andalusia
and
to
extend
a
helping
hand
to
sebastiani
if
he
should
meet
with
any
resistance
in
his
conquest
of
the
kingdom
of
granada
on
the
afternoon
of
february
joseph
entered
seville
in
triumph
at
the
head
of
his
guard
and
lodged
himself
in
the
alcazar
the
old
residence
of
the
kings
of
spain
he
was
welcomed
by
a
deputation
which
comprised
some
persons
of
mark
the
impression
made
on
the
citizens
by
the
conduct
of
the
two
juntas
and
the
turbulence
of
the
mob
which
had
ruled
during
the
last
eight
days
had
been
so
deplorable
that
a
considerable
number
of
the
sevillians
despaired
of
the
national
cause
and
rushed
to
acknowledge
the
usurper
indeed
there
were
more
josefinos
found
in
this
city
than
in
any
other
corner
of
spain
the
intrusive
king
released
a
number
of
political
prisoners
whom
the
last
junta
had
arrested
on
suspicion
of
treason
apparently
this
suspicion
had
been
well
grounded
as
many
of
the
captives
headed
by
the
swiss
generals
preux
and
reding
did
homage
to
joseph
and
accepted
office
under
him
younger
brother
of
the
victor
of
baylen
encouraged
by
these
defections
to
his
cause
and
by
the
fact
that
deputations
had
presented
themselves
from
cordova
and
jaen
to
bespeak
his
protection
joseph
hastened
to
publish
an
absurd
address
to
his
army
couched
in
the
magniloquent
style
which
all
french
writers
of
proclamations
at
this
time
were
wont
to
borrow
from
their
emperor
the
barriers
placed
by
nature
between
the
north
and
the
south
of
spain
have
fallen
you
have
met
with
friends
only
beyond
the
sierra
morena
jaen
cordova
seville
have
flung
open
their
gates
the
king
of
spain
desires
that
between
the
pillars
of
hercules
a
third
pillar
shall
arise
to
recall
to
posterity
and
to
the
navigators
of
both
the
new
and
the
old
world
the
memory
of
the
officers
and
men
of
that
french
army
which
drove
back
the
english
saved
thirty
thousand
spaniards
pacified
the
ancient
baetica
and
regained
for
france
her
natural
the
rather
puzzling
passage
concerning
the
thirty
thousand
spaniards
saved
refers
to
the
prisoners
of
ocaña
and
the
sierra
morena
whom
the
french
according
to
the
king
recognized
as
brethren
led
astray
by
the
common
enemy
you
spared
them
and
i
have
received
them
as
my
some
elation
in
the
king
s
language
was
perhaps
pardonable
at
the
moment
the
moral
effect
of
the
surrender
of
seville
was
considerable
in
france
england
and
the
rest
of
europe
though
less
in
spain
than
elsewhere
the
tangible
trophies
of
the
conquest
were
enormous
the
place
had
been
the
central
arsenal
of
spain
and
the
amount
of
artillery
ammunition
and
warlike
equipment
captured
was
very
large
the
and
other
military
factories
were
taken
over
in
excellent
condition
and
kept
the
french
army
of
andalusia
well
supplied

the
three
years
of
its
existence

it

to
a
considerable
additional

nothing
had
been
done
since
the
news
of
the
passage
of
the
sierra
morena
had
arrived
to
destroy
or
remove
all
this
valuable
state
property
on
the
day
following
their
entry
into
seville
joseph
and
soult
directed
victor
to
march
in
pursuit
of
albuquerque
and
to
take
possession
of
cadiz
so
complete
had
been
the
of
the
spanish
armies
since
the
andalusian
campaign
began
that
it
seems
to
have
been
supposed
that
the
army
of
estremadura
would
offer
no
serious
resistance
even
if
it
should
succeed
in
throwing
itself
into
cadiz
before
it
was
overtaken
marching
with
laudable
expedition
the
duke
of
belluno
covered
the
miles
between
seville
and
cadiz
in
four
days
and
presented
himself
in
front
of
the
place
on
the
evening
of
february
but
albuquerque
unmolested
in
his
march
from
utrera
had
arrived
on
the
bringing
with
him
not
only
his
own
troops
and
those
of
copons
but
several
picked
up
at
xeres
lebrija
san
lucar
and
puerto
santa
maria
where
they
had
been
organizing
he
had
some
men
in
all
not
counting
the
civic
militia
of
cadiz
which
had
hitherto
been
its
sole
garrison
cadiz
in
the
days
when
the
practicable
range
of
the
heaviest
artillery
did
not
exceed
yards
was
one
of
the
strongest
places
in
the
world
the
town
lies
on
the
extreme
point
of
a
long
sandy
peninsula
which
runs
out
into
the
sea
from
the
isla
de
leon
a
large
island
separated
from
the
mainland
of
andalusia
by
the
channel
of
the
rio
santi
petri
an
arm
of
the
sea
varying
from
to
yards
in
breadth
and
flowing
through
marshes
which
make
access
to
its
banks
very
difficult
the
isla
protected
by
this
enormous
wet
ditch
has
a
front
towards
the
continent
of
about
seven
miles
from
the
naval
arsenal
of
la
carraca
at
its
north
end
to
the
castle
of
santi
petri
at
its
south
batteries
had
already
been
thrown
up
at
all
the
commanding
points
and
albuquerque
had
broken
the
only
bridge
that
of
zuazo
which
crossed
the
marsh
and
the
rio
it
would
be
impossible
to
pass
the
channel
save
by
collecting
great
quantities
of
boats
and
these
would
have
to
move
under
artillery
fire
venegas
the
military
governor
of
cadiz
had
already
ordered
all
the
vessels
small
and
great
of
the
villages
round
the
bay
to
be
destroyed
or
brought
across
to
the
city
moreover
there
were
a
score
of
gunboats
in
the
channel
manned
from
the
spanish
fleet
which
could
be
used
to
oppose
any
attempt
to
cross
the
rio
indeed
naval
assistance
to
any
amount
was
available
for
the
defence
of
cadiz
there
were
a
dozen
spanish
and
four
english
ships
in
the
harbour
all
through
the
three
long
years
while
the
french
lay
in
front
of
the
isla
no
attempt
was
ever
made
to
throw
a
force
in
boats
across
the
channel
the
venture
seemed
too
hazardous
if
however
victor
had
by
some
expedient
succeeded
in
crossing
the
rio
there
were
two
lines
of
defence
behind
it
of
far
greater
strength
than
that
formed
by
this
outer
ditch
of
the
cadiz
works
the
triangular
isla
de
leon
forms
with
its
apex
a
long
which
projects
for
four
miles
into
the
atlantic
half
way
along
it
the
breadth
of
the
spit
is
contracted
to
no
more
than
yards
and
here
there
was
a
continuous
entrenchment
from
water
to
water
called
the
cortadura
or
the
battery
of
san
fernando
armed
with
many
heavy
guns
supposing
this
isthmus
to
have
been
passed
there
lies
two
miles
further
along
the
the
outer
enceinte
of
cadiz
itself
with
a
front
of
not
more
than
yards
in
breadth
and
deep
water
on
either
side
cadiz
had
been
captured
more
than
once
in
earlier
wars
but
always
by
an
enemy
who
could
attack
from
the
sea
neither
the
isla
de
leon
nor
the
san
fernando
line
could
be
held
against
an
attack
supported
by
a
fleet
which
came
close
in
shore
and
battered
the
works
from
flank
and
rear
or
landed
troops
behind
them
the
sea
it
may
be
remarked
is
four
fathoms
deep
to
within
a
short
distance
about
yards
of
the
shore
all
along
the
south
front
of
the
isla
and
the
isthmus
so
that
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
a
fleet
coming
close
to
the
works
but
against
any
naval
attack
cadiz
was
in
absolutely
secured
by
the
predominance
of
the
english
fleet
there
was
no
armed
french
vessel
nearer
than
bayonne
or
barcelona
nor
any
possibility
of
bringing
one
round
all
that
was
done
by
the
besiegers
in
a
three
years
leaguer
was
to
build
some
gunboats
in
the
northern
inlets
of
the
bay
and
these
they
never
dared
to
bring
out
into
the
open
water
the
real
danger
to
cadiz
lay
not
from
the
sea
side
nor
on
the
isla
front
but
from
the
inner
side
of
the
harbour
and
the
east
here
a
long
spit
of
land
runs
out
from
beside
the
town
of
puerto
real
in
the
direction
of
cadiz
it
is
called
the
trocadero
from
a
village
situated
on
its
side
at
its
extreme
point
is
a
fort
named
san
josé
while
another
fort
named
san
luis
lies
alongside
of
the
other
on
a
low
in
advance
of
both
built
right
in
the
marsh
and
surrounded
by
water
at
was
a
third
called
matagorda
these
three
forts
were
the
outer
defences
of
the
harbour
against
a
naval
attack
and
could
cross
fires
with
the
town
batteries
and
a
castle
called
puntales
which
lies
on
the
easternmost
point
of
the
isthmus
a
mile
from
the
battery
of
san
fernando
matagorda
is
only
yards
from
puntales
and
yards
from
the
eastern
point
of
the
city
of
cadiz
if
the
french
took
possession
of
it
and
of
the
neighbouring
san
josé
and
san
luis
they
could
bombard
the
puntales
castle
and
all
the
neighbouring
section
of
the
isthmus
to
the
grave
danger
and
discomfort
of
all
who
had
to
pass
between
the
city
and
the
isla
de
leon
they
would
also
be
able
to
annoy
ships
lying
in
all
the
eastern
reaches
of
the
great
harbour
but
before
victor
arrived
in
front
of
cadiz
san
josé
san
luis
and
matagorda
were
blown
up
with
the
leave
of
the
governor
venegas
by
a
detachment
of
seamen
from
the
british
fleet
there
could
therefore
be
no
trouble
from
this
direction
unless
the
enemy
succeeded
in
restoring
and
rearming
the
three
forts
no
easy
task
under
the
fire
of
the
puntales
castle
and
the
fleet
it
was
not
till
some
months
had
passed
that
the
struggle
began
for
these
ruined
works
the
only
points
from
which
the
defence
could
be
seriously
incommoded
on
his
first
arrival
victor
summoned
the
town
and
received
a
prompt
and
angry
answer
of
refusal
from
the
governor
and
the
local
junta
the
marshal
inspected
the
city
s
outer
defences
and
was
forced
to
report
to
the
king
at
seville
that
it
seemed
that
nothing
could
be
done
against
the
place
till
he
had
brought
up
heavy
artillery
and
built
himself
boats
joseph
unwilling
to
believe
anything
that
contradicted
the
hopes
of
complete
triumph
that
he
had
been
nourishing
ever
since
the
passage
of
the
sierra
morena
came
up
to
puerto
santa
maria
on
the
bay
of
cadiz
looked
at
the
situation
did
not
find
it
reassuring
and
wrote
to
his
imperial
brother
to
propose
that
he
should
send
out
his
toulon
fleet
to
attack
the
place
on
the
sea
side
napoleon
still
smarting
under
the
memory
of
how
admiral
martin
had
destroyed
an
important
section
of
that
fleet
in
the
preceding
october
ignored
this
proposal
he
did
not
forget
though
his
brother
had
apparently
done
so
the
fact
that
the
british
mediterranean
fleet
was
still
in
existence
sire
il

si
votre

joseph

thus
the
position
in
front
of
cadiz
assumed
the
shape
which
it
was
to
maintain
for
months
and
even
for
years
victor
s
corps
could
provide
enough
men
to
observe
the
whole
shore
of
the
bay
and
to
blockade
the
garrison
but
the
spaniards
recovered
their
courage
when
they
saw
the
enemy
reduced
to
inactivity
and
began
ere
long
to
receive
reinforcements
the
first
to
arrive
were
of
the
regular
troops
which
had
been
at
seville
this
corps
under
the
visconde
de
gand
had
escaped
westward
after
the
capitulation
and
though
pursued
by
a
brigade
of
mortier
s
corps
reached
ayamonte
at
the
mouth
of
the
guadiana
and
there
took
ship
for
cadiz
somewhat
later
there
arrived
some
troops
sent
by
wellington
the
spaniards
in
their
day
of
disaster
had
forgotten
their
old
jealousy
about
cadiz
and
asked
for
aid
wellington
though
loath
to
spare
a
man
from
portugal
sent
them
in
the
early
days
of
february
three
british
and
two
portuguese
battalions
from
lisbon
under
general
william
stewart
so
promptly
were
these
troops
shipped
and
landed
that
they
arrived
at
cadiz
between
the
and
the
of
february
to
the
number
of
about
bayonets
thus
the
town
was
placed
in
security
from
any
de
on
victor
s
part

and

and

illustration
cadiz
and
its
environs
the
internal
situation
in
cadiz
however
left
much
to
be
desired
the
town
had
elected
a
local
junta
of
defence
of
which
the
governor
venegas
was
made
president
and
this
body
had
frequent
disputes
with
the
new
regency
nominated
by
the
central
junta
at
the
time
of
its
abdication
and
also
with
albuquerque
whom
venegas
did
not
wish
to
recognize
as
his
hierarchical
superior
the
local
body
could
make
a
fair
show
of
objections
to
recognizing
the
legitimacy
of
the
regency
the
old
central
junta
itself
had
a
doubtful
origin
and
the
government
nominated
by
those
of
its
members
who
had
taken
refuge
in
cadiz
could
not
claim
a
clear
title
but
to
raise
the
point
at
this
moment
of
crisis
was
factious
and
unpatriotic
and
the
conduct
of
the
local
junta
became
merely
absurd
when
it
tried
to
arrogate
to
itself
authority
extending
outside
its
own
city
and
to
issue
orders
to
the
outlying
provinces
or
the
colonies
of
america
still
worse
it
refused
to
issue
clothing
and
footgear
to
albuquerque
s
army
whose
equipment
had
been
worn
out
by
the
long
march
from
estremadura
or
to
subsidize
the
military
hospitals
though
it
had
a
considerable
stock
both
of
money
and
of
military
stores
at
its
disposition
at
the
end
of
february
the
regency
nominated
venegas
viceroy
of
mexico
and
having
bought
him
off
with
this
splendid
piece
of
preferment
made
albuquerque
his
successor
in
the
governorship
of
cadiz
but
even
thus
they
did
not
succeed
in
getting
proper
control
over
the
city
for
the
junta
refused
to
allow
the
duke
to
place
his
head
quarters
within
the
walls
or
to
issue
orders
to
the
civic
militia
a
was
only
reached
when
the
regents
made
an
ignominious
pact
with
the
local
oligarchy
by
which
the
latter
in
return
for
recognizing
their
legitimate
authority
and
undertaking
to
pay
and
feed
the
garrison
were
granted
the
control
of
the
and
other
royal
taxes
of
cadiz
as
well
as
of
all
the
subsidies
arriving
from
america
how
the
functions
of
government
became
still
further
complicated
when
the
members
of
the
cortes
began
to
arrive
and
to
claim
their
rights
as
the
sole
legitimate
representatives
of
the
nation
must
be
told
in
another
chapter
for
a
scathing
account
of
the
conduct
of
the
cadiz
junta
and
its
doings
see
schepeler
vol

napier
very
rightly
calls
it
an
imperious
body
without
honour
talents
or
patriotism
ii
leaving
matters
at
a
deadlock
in
and
about
cadiz
we
must
turn
back
to
the
operations
of
the
french
in
the
outlying
parts
of
andalusia
sebastiani
it
will
be
remembered
had
taken
jaen
on
january
he
was
directed
to
march
from
thence
on
granada
and
malaga
to
scatter
the
remains
of
areizaga
s
army
and
to
subdue
the
valleys
of
the
sierra
nevada
and
the
long
below
them
all
this
he
accomplished
with
ease
on
the
he
routed
at
alcala
la
real
a
force
composed
of
some
of
areizaga
s
fugitives
which
had
been
joined
by
freire
and
all
the
cavalry
of
the
andalusian
army
these
regiments
which
had
been
cantoned
in
the
valley
of
the
guadalquivir
since
they
were
useless
in
the
passes
had
been
collected
by
freire
to
the
number
of
sabres
they
were
routed
and
dispersed
by
milhaud
s
and
perreymond
s
dragoons
and
chasseurs
losing
over
men
and
the
whole
of
their
artillery
the
survivors
dispersed
and
retired
in
small
parties
eastward
only
rallying
in
the
province
of
murcia
that
same
evening
sebastiani
pushed
on
towards
granada
and
was
met
by
a
deputation
of
its
magistrates
who
brought
the
keys
of
the
city
and
a
promise
of
submission
the
french
vanguard
entered
it
next
day
lacy
who
had
taken
refuge
there
with
the
small
remains
of
his
division
retired
to
guadix
sebastiani
levied
a
military
contribution
of
reals
on
the
city
placed
a
garrison
of
men
in
the
alhambra
and
marched
with
a
mixed
force
on
malaga
the
only
place
in
this
quarter
where
organized
resistance
showed
itself
here
the
local
magistrates
had
been
deposed
by
a
popular
rising
and
several
thousand
irregulars
had
been
collected
by
a
colonel
abello
a
capuchin
friar
named
fernando
berrocal
and
three
brothers
notaries
of
the
name
of

they
seized
the
passes
of
the
sierra
de
alhama
and
called
all
the
to
arms
sebastiani
marching
by
antequera
cleared
the
passes
on
february
beat
the
insurgent
bands
outside
the
suburbs
of
malaga
and
stormed
the
town
he
exacted
a
contribution
of
reals
and
hung
the
three
san
millans
and
several
other
leading
insurgents
after
this
he
extended
his
troops
along
the
coast
and
occupied
velez
malaga
motril
and
almunecar
the
roads
and
the
towns
were
his
but
many
of
the
insurgents
took
to
the
hills
and
maintained
a
guerrilla
warfare
which
never
ceased
throughout
the
next
three
years
there
were
always
bands
on
foot
in
the
alpujarras
and
the
sierra
de
ronda
though
the
corps
expended
much
energy
in
hunting
them
down
meanwhile
giron
lacy
freire
and
the
rest
of
the
fugitive
generals
had
retired
eastward
they
had
now
come
under
the
orders
of
blake
who
superseded
areizaga
and
took
over
charge
of
or
dispirited
men
at
guadix
on
january
he
retired
at
once
within
the
borders
of
the
kingdom
of
murcia
small
parties
and
stragglers
continued
to
come
in
for
many
weeks
and
by
march
there
were
foot
and
horse
collected
all
in
the
worst
state
of
equipment
and
thoroughly
demoralized
by
their
late
disasters
we
must
now
turn
to
the
other
end
of
andalusia
king
joseph
when
departing
to
inspect
the
outworks
of
cadiz
had
left
mortier
in
command
in
this
quarter
the
marshal
after
hunting
the
little
force
of
the
visconde
de
gand
out
of
the
condado
de
niebla
had
been
directed
to
deal
a
stroke
at
badajoz
accordingly
leaving
a
brigade
in
seville
and

the
continual
existence
of
portugal
down
to
the
present
day
in
face
of
the
persistent
hostility
and
immensely
superior
force
of
its
neighbour
spain
seems
at
first
sight
to
be
one
of
the
most
inexplicable
phenomena
in
modern
history
it
appears
all
the
more
astounding
when
we
remember
that
the
lesser
kingdom
was
once
conquered
and
held
down
for
sixty
years
by
the
greater
power
few
states
have
won
back
and
maintained
their
independence
in
such
masterful
fashion
as
did
portugal
in
the
long
war
of
independence
that
followed
the
insurrection
of
under
the
house
of
braganza
but
intense
national
spirit
and
heroic
obstinacy
on
the
part
of
the
smaller
people
are
not
sufficient
to
account
for
the
survival
of
the
portuguese
kingdom
as
a
separate
entity
its
geography
which
at
the
first
sight
seems
hopelessly
unfavourable
to
its
defence
turns
out
on
investigation
to
be
eminently
suitable
for
resistance
against
an
attack
from
the
east
on
a
first
glance
at
the
map
it
appears
as
if
portugal
was
composed
of
no
more
than
the
lower
valleys
of
three
great
spanish
rivers
the
douro
the
tagus
and
the
guadiana
so
that
the
state
which
owns
of
the
course
of
each
of
these
streams
has
but
to
send
down
its
armies
from
the
uplands
of
leon
and
new
castile
to
conquer
the
narrow
land
which
lies
about
their
estuaries
but
nothing
can
be
more
deceptive
than
the
map
when
the
iberian
peninsula
is
in
question
as
we
observed
in
our
earlier
volume
the
rivers
of
spain
and
portugal
are
not
highways
or
lines
of
communication
but
barriers
torrents
sunk
in
gorges
cut
deep
below
the
level
of
the
face
of
the
land
the
chief
roads
with
few
exceptions
avoid
instead
of
courting
the
neighbourhood
of
the
great
streams
the
leading
routes
which
descend
from
spain
into
portugal
in
no
case
follow
the
lines
of
the
douro
or
the
tagus
though
the
which
form
the
heart
of
the
kingdom
of
portugal
its
most
wealthy
and
populous
regions
lie
about
the
mouths
of
those
rivers
it
is
not
by
descending
their
banks
that
conquest
or
trade
arrives
most
easily
at
its
goal
as
a
matter
of
fact
spain
and
portugal
turn
their
backs
upon
each
other
the
smaller
realm
looks
out
upon
the
sea

strength
and
wealth
lie
upon
the
atlantic
coast
the
inland
that
touches
spain
is
rugged
and
unpeopled
in
many
parts
a
mere
waste
of
rock
and
heath
nor
on
the
other
hand
do
leon
and
new
castile
look
towards
portugal
the
real
ports
of
madrid
are
valencia
and
alicante
not
lisbon
and
that
not
from
political
reasons
but
simply
because
those
are
the
points
where
the
sea
can
be
reached
with
the
minimum
of
mountain
and
desert
to
be
passed
through
the
way
down
from
the
central
tableland
of
spain
to
the
mediterranean
is
less
difficult
than
the
way
down
to
the
atlantic
hence
comes
the
fact
that
the
leading
from
spain
into
portugal
are
so
surprisingly
few
and
that
the
two
main
alternative
routes
from
madrid
to
lisbon
run
the
one
much
further
north
the
other
much
further
south
than
might
have
been
expected
there
is
not
now
and
never
has
been
any
straight
road
down
the
tagus
between
the
two
capitals
obvious
though
the
line
looks
upon
the
map
the
two
main
gates
of
portugal
are
at
almeida
and
elvas
at
alcantara
which
appears
the
natural
point
of
approach
there
is

the
most
miserable
of

a
student
of
the
war
of
the
spanish
succession
is
always
surprised
to
see
how
much
fighting
took
place
on
fronts
which
were
left
severely
alone
by
the
english
and
french
in
in
the
old
wars
between
spain
and
portugal
the
whole
land
frontier
of
the
smaller
kingdom
was
exposed
to
attacks
from
the
larger
but
the
circumstances
of
differed
from
those
of
or
or
in
that
the
subsidiary
campaigns
in
the
extreme
north
and
south
which
had
always
accompanied
the
main
clash
along
the
frontiers
of
beira
and
alemtejo
could
not
on
this
occasion
take
place
the
french
were
no
longer
in
possession
of
galicia
from
which
the
spaniards
had
been
wont
to
demonstrate
against
oporto
nor
at
the
other
extremity
of
the
line
had
they
a
firm
grip
on
huelva
and
the
condado
de
niebla
from
which
alone
an
attack
could
be
directed
against
the
remote
southern
province
of
algarve
portugal
presents
three
sections
of
frontier
to
an
invader
coming
from
the
side
of
spain
the
northernmost
that
from
the
mouth
of
the
minho
to
was
not
within
the
scope
of
operations
in
it
can
only
be
approached
from
galicia
that
province
was
not
subdued
nor
had
the
french
any
intention
of
dealing
with
it
till
after
they
should
have
dealt
with
portugal
an
invasion
of
the
and
the
would
have
been
an
objectless
operation
they
would
fall
of
themselves
if
once
lisbon
were
captured
and
the
english
expelled
from
the
peninsula
a
move
against
oporto
by
some
flanking
division
of
the
invading
army
might
have
been
conceivable
but
such
an
attempt
would
be
made
if
made
at
all
from
the
south
of
the
douro
through
northern
beira
and
not
through
the
mountains
of
the
there
remain
two
other
sections
of
the
portuguese
frontier
the
one
from
the
douro
to
the
tagus
and
the
other
from
the
tagus
to
the
guadiana
both
of
these
were
accessible
to
the
french
in
since
they
were
in
possession
alike
of
the
plains
of
leon
and
of
la
mancha
and
of
northern
andalusia
it
was
open
to
them
to
choose
one
or
the
other
front
for
attack
or
to
attack
both
at
once
lisbon
being
the
objective
it
was
clear
that
an
attack
on
the
northern
or
beira
frontier
possessed
a
paramount
advantage
over
an
attack
on
the
southern
or
alemtejo
frontier
a
successful
advance
north
of
the
tagus
brings
the
invader
directly
to
the
gates
of
lisbon
one
south
of
the
tagus
brings
him
only
to
the
heights
of
almada
where
he
is
separated
from
the
portuguese
capital
by
the
broad
estuary
of
the
tagus
napoleon
s
power
like
that
of
the
devil
in
mediaeval
legends
ended
at
the
edge
of
the
salt
water
and
in
face
of
the
naval
strength
which
the
english
always
maintained
at
lisbon
a
victorious
french
army
camped
on
the
heights
of
almada
would
be
almost
as
far
from
final
success
as
when
it
started
from
spain
the
yards
of
strait
which
protected
the
portuguese
capital
could
not
be
crossed
the
most
that
the
invader
could
accomplish
would
be
to
worry
the
ships
in
the
port
and
the
lower
quarters
of
the
city
by
a
distant
bombardment
if
he
could
bring
up
heavy
guns
from
spain
for
nearly
twenty
miles
inland
from
lisbon
the
estuary
of
the
tagus
expands
into
a
broad
brackish
lagoon
four
to
eleven
miles
broad
a
complete
protection
against
any
attack
from
the
east
only
at
alhandra
does
this
inland
sea
contract
and
for
some
further
miles
northward
from
that
point
the
eastern
bank
of
the
tagus
is
formed
by
broad
cut
up
by
countless
channels
of
water
and
practically
inaccessible
it
is
only
at
salvaterra
thirty
miles
north
of
lisbon
that
the
tagus
assumes
its
ordinary
breadth
and
becomes
an
ordinary
military
obstacle
from
that
point
upwards
an
invader
from
the
andalusian
side
might
endeavour
to
cross
it
and
it
presents
no
more
difficulties
than
any
other
broad
river
but
though
even
rhines
and
danubes
may
be
passed
in
the
face
of
an
enemy
the
operation
is
not
one
which
a
prudent
general
courts
and
the
tagus
is
broad
absolutely
bridgeless
and
fickle
in
the
extreme
in
its
alternations
of
high
and
low
water
to
fight
one
s
way
from
the
valley
of
the
guadiana
in
order
to
meet
such
a
problem
at
the
end
does
not
seem
inviting
and
even
if
the
tagus
is
passed
there
are
still
thirty
miles
of
road
including
some
formidable
defensive
positions
between
the
invader
and
lisbon
yet
there
was
one
contingency
under
which
an
advance
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
might
be
advantageous
to
the
invader
and
so
possible
was
this
contingency
that
wellington
from
the
very
first
had
declared
that
he
thought
it
probable
that
the
french
would
move
troops
in
that
direction
if
the
army
were
drawn
away
to
the
beira
frontier
between
tagus
and
douro
in
order
to
resist
a
front
attack
delivered
from
the
plains
of
leon
and
if
it
became
involved
in
an
active
campaign
somewhere
far
to
the
north
on
the
line
of
the
coa
or
the
mondego
or
the
alva
a
subsidiary
french
force
striking
south
of
the
tagus
from
the
direction
of
spanish
estremadura
might
give
dreadful
trouble
if
it
could
cross
the
tagus
anywhere
between
abrantes
and
salvaterra
it
might
get
between
the
army
and
its
base
and
either
fall
upon
its
rear
or
capture
lisbon
for
this
reason
wellington
so
far
back
as
october
had
made
up
his
mind
that
if
the
french
had
an
army
on
foot
anywhere
in
the
direction
of
badajoz
and
elvas
he
must
leave
a
considerable
proportion
of
his
own
forces
to
watch
them
and
to
defend
if
need
be
the
line
of
the
lower
tagus
as
long
as
the
enemy
had
not
yet
subdued
badajoz
and
the
neighbouring
fortresses
and
while
there
was
still
a
strong
spanish
army
in
that
quarter
the
need
for
precaution
was
not
so
pressing
nevertheless
all
through
the
summer
of
wellington
kept
hill
with
one
english
and
one
portuguese
division
at
portalegre
south
of
the
tagus
though
he
withdrew
this
detachment
when
masséna
marched
on
coimbra
matters
were
much
more
perilous
after
the
battle
of
the
gebora
and
the
fall
of
badajoz
in
february
from
that
time
onward
all
through
and
nearly
a
third
of
the
army
was
kept
in
the
alemtejo
first
under
beresford
then
under
hill
in
order
to
guard
against
the
possible
stab
in
the
back
from
the
french
army
of
andalusia

in
his
very
judicious
remarks
on
of
his
of
published
just
before
masséna
s
invasion
sums
up
the
situation
with
a
passage
may
without
any
difficulty
be
forced
to
the
left
bank
of
the
tagus
but
then
the
enemy
is
as
far
from
the
accomplishment
of
his
project
as
before
the
river
forming
an
insuperable
barrier
if
well
wellington
to
fletcher
commanding
royal
engineers
the
enemy
will
probably
attack
on
two
distinct
lines
the
one
south
the
other
north
of
the
tagus
and
the
system
of
defence
must
be
founded
upon
this
general
basis
his
object
will
be
by
means
of
the
corps
south
of
the
tagus
to
turn
the
positions
which
we
shall
take
up
in
front
of
the
corps
north
of
that
river
to
cut
off
from
lisbon
the
corps
opposed
to
him
and
to
destroy
it
by
an
attack
in
front
and
rear
this
can
be
avoided
only
by
the
retreat
of
the
right
centre
and
left
of
the
allies
to
a
point
at
which
from
the
state
of
the
river
they
can
not
be
turned
by
the
passage
of
the
tagus
by
the
enemy
s
left
six
days
later
wellington
wrote
to
admiral
berkeley
in
similar
terms
it
is
probable
that
in
the
event
of
the
enemy
being
enabled
to
invade
this
country
in
force
he
will
make
his
main
attack
by
the
right
of
the
tagus
but
he
will
employ
one
corps
on
the
left
of
the
river
with
the
object
of
embarrassing
if
not
of
preventing
the
embarcation
of
the
british
but
the
attack
south
of
the
tagus
was
in
wellington
s
and
also
we
may
add
in
napoleon
s
conception
only
a
secondary
operation
the
main
invasion
was
almost
inevitably
bound
to
take
place
on
the
beira
not
on
the
alemtejo
frontier
between
fregeneda
where
the
portuguese
border
line
quits
the
douro
to
the
pass
of
villa
velha
on
the
tagus
there
is
a
distance
of
somewhat
more
than
miles
the
division
between
portugal
and
spain
does
not
lie
along
any
natural
feature
such
as
a
mountain
range
or
a
broad
river
though
two
small
sections
of
the
frontier
are
coincident
with
the
insignificant
streams
of
the
elga
and
the
agueda
it
is
rather
drawn
in
a
somewhat
arbitrary
and
haphazard
fashion
through
the
midst
of
the
desert
upland
where
spain
and
portugal
turn
their
backs
to
each
other
for
the
only
piece
of
flat
on
the
whole
border
is
that
from
the
douro
to
almeida
a
mere
ten
or
twelve
miles
and
immediately
behind

three
or
four
miles
from

the

bring

up

became

and
the
combatant
who
first
exhausted
his
provisions
had
to
retire
and
to
disperse
his
divisions
in
search
of
the
wherewithal
to
live
thanks
to
wellington
s
providence
it
was
always
the
french
who
were
forced
to
this
expedient
so
much
so
that
in
xx

find
him
informing

that

not
be
touched

after

in

into
two
sections
by
the
range
of

crosses
the

right
angles
half
way
between

it

known
as
the

it
reaches

its
central
ganglion
lies
between

of

the

this
point

great

which
separate
the
valleys
of
the

the

must
make
his
choice
whether
he
will
advance
into
portugal
south
or
north
of
the
serra
da
estrella
to
attempt
to
do
so
on
both
sides
of
the
range
would
be
risking
too
much
if
there
is
an
enemy
of
any
strength
in
the
field
since
the
columns
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
would
be
hopelessly
separated
and
liable
to
be
beaten
in
detail
in
the
whole
peninsular
war
there
was
only
one
invasion
made
by
the
southern
route
that
of
junot
in
the
winter
of
it
was
successful
because
it
was
absolutely
unopposed
nevertheless
the
french
lost
many
men
had
to
leave
their
artillery
behind
them
and
only
arrived
with
the
shadow
of
an
army
at
abrantes
it
is
true
that
junot
chose
absolutely
the
worst
path
that
could
be
found
between
the
serra
da
estrella
and
the
tagus
the
pass
of
rosmarinhal
close
above
the
latter
river
and
that
he
would
have
fared
not
quite
so
badly
if
he
had
marched
from
zarza
on
idanha
and
castello
branco
but
even
at
the
best
this
region
is
most
inhospitable
there
are
points
where
water
is
not
procurable
on
stretches
of
eight
or
ten
miles
others
where
the
main
road
is
so
steep
that
a
requires
not
only
a
dozen
horses
but
the
assistance
of
fifty
men
to
get
it
up
the
slope
except
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
castello

the
is
almost
uninhabited
the
whole
corregidoria
which
took
its
name
from
that
town
and
extended
from
the

to
the
zezere

only
souls

its
broad
limits
it
was
forty
miles
long
by
thirty
broad
the
size
of
a
large
english
county
junot
s
experiences
served
as
a
warning
to
his
successors
and
no
french
army
during
the
rest
of
the
war
endeavoured
to
cross
this
corner
of
portugal
when
advancing
on
lisbon
castello
branco
was
seized
once
or
twice
by
a
raiding
force
but
it
was
never
used
as
the
of
an
army
making
a
serious
attempt
to
advance
towards
the
portuguese
capital
the
above
notes
on
the
castello

and
its
roads
are
mostly
derived
from
eliot

of
eliot
has
marched
all
over
the
region
see
his
pages
there
remains
to
be
considered
only
the
section
of
the
frontier
between
the
douro
and
the
serra
da
estrella
the
front
on
which
masséna
s
great
blow
was
delivered
in
the
autumn
of
it
was
a
region
which
had
from
the
earliest
times
been
the
of
the
spanish
and
portuguese
half
a
dozen
times
since
the
middle
ages
armies
from
the
plains
of
leon
had
invaded
the
beira
on
this
front
such
campaigns
always
began
with
a
siege
of
almeida
the
pushed
out
in
front
of
the
mountains
to
face
the
spanish
ciudad
rodrigo
almeida
generally
fell
it
is
too
advanced
a
position
for
safety
and
as
dumouriez
remarked
in
his
military
study
of
portugal
its
value
would
have
doubled
if
it
had
only
been
placed
upon
the
west
instead
of
the
east
bank
of
the
coa
close
to
the
friendly
mountains
and
not
on
the
outskirts
of
the
perilous
plain
but
rare
indeed
were
the
occasions
on
which
the
spaniard
succeeded
in
piercing
the
broad
belt
of
tangled
upland
beyond
almeida
and
appearing
at
the
gates
of
coimbra
or
oporto
illustration
central
portugal
there
are
four
lines
of
further
advance
open
to
an
invader
who
has
captured
almeida
the
first
a
march
on
oporto
via
pinhel
and
lamego
may
be
mentioned
only
to
be
dismissed
from
consideration
it
is
of
no
use
to
an
army
which
aims
at
lisbon
and
proposes
to
conquer
portugal
by
a
blow
at
its
heart
masséna
whose
directions
were
to
drive
the
british
into
the
sea
in
the
shortest
and
most
effective
fashion
could
not
have
contemplated
such
a
secondary
object
as
the
capture
of
oporto
for
a
moment
there
remain
three
other
roads
to
be
investigated
the
road
north
of
the
river
mondego
by
celorico
vizeu
bussaco
and
coimbra
the
corresponding
and
parallel
road
south
of
the
mondego
from
celorico
by
chamusca
maceira
and
ponte
de
murcella
to
coimbra
the
road
which
striking
south
from
celorico
crosses
the
headwaters
of
the
zezere
by
belmonte
and
fundão
and
then
climbing
the
serra
de
moradal
descends
to
castello
branco
and
from
thence
reaches
abrantes
by
the
sobreira
formosa
it
may
be
remarked
by
the
way
that
nothing
in
all
the
geography
of
portugal
seems
more
astonishing
than
that
there
should
not
be
a
fourth
alternative
road
one
down
the
long
valley
of
the
zezere
which
running
in
a
straight
line
from
belmonte
to
abrantes
looks
on
the
map
as
if
it
ought
to
be
a
main
artery
of
communication
and
seems
to
indicate
the
obvious
road
to
lisbon
from
almeida
since
a
straight
line
drawn
between
these
points
would
run
along
the
river
for
some
forty
miles
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
neither
a
first
nor
a
road
down
the
zezere
the
only
towns
on
its
course
covilhão
and
belmonte
lie
hard
by
its
sources
and
its
central
reaches
were
almost
uninhabited
the
only
good
line
of
communication
running
near
it
is
a
or
duplication
of
the
third
route
mentioned
above
called
the
which
leaving
the
upper
zezere
at
belmonte
keeps
high
up
the
side
of
the
serra
de
moradal
and
rejoins
the
castello
branco
road
at
sobreira
formosa
this
route
was
much
employed
by
wellington
in
later
years
as
a
military
road
from
north
to
south
usable
even
when
castello
branco
was
threatened
by
the
french
but
in
he
had
ordered
it
to
be
rendered
impassable
and
this
had
been
done
by
making
several
long
cuttings
at
points
where
the
track
passed
along
precipices
the
whole
roadway
being
blown
or
shovelled
down
into
the
gulf
below
the
french
were
of
course
unaware
of
this
and
masséna
is
said
by
his
confidant
foy
to
have
taken
the
into
serious
consideration
and
to
have
decided
against
it
because
of
the
necessity
for
forcing
the
passage
of
the
zezere
when
the
defiles
were
passed
and
for
laying
siege
to
abrantes
a
far
more
practical
objection
was
its
extreme
wildness
it
runs
along
an
absolutely
uninhabited
and
the
neighbourhood
is
destitute
not
only
of
food
but
of
water
for
great
sections
of
its
length
this
masséna
ought
to
have
known
if
his
portuguese
advisers
had
been
competent
apparently
he
was
wholly
unaware
of
its
character
just
as
he
was
necessarily
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
his
prescient
adversary
had
blasted
away
huge
sections
of
it
so
that
it
was
absolutely
impassable
for
guns
or
wagons
as
also
that
earthworks
had
been
carefully
constructed
to
cover
the
point
where
it
debouches
on
to
the
zezere
for
the
perilous
adventure
among
these
cuttings
of
a
small
french
column
which
crossed
the
estrada
nova
that
which
escorted
foy
back
to
santarem
in
see
the
autobiography
of
general
hulot
pp
a
considerable
number
of
men
and
horses
fell
down
these
cuttings
in
a
forced
and
in
all
several
hundred
men
of
foy
s
column
perished
starved
and
on
this
inhospitable
road
the
survivors
only
got
through
by
cutting
a
slippery
along
the
precipices
nothing
on
wheels
could
have
passed
that
way
in
foy
s
interesting
minute
of
his
conversation
with
napoleon
about
the
invasion
on
when
he
had
taken
home
masséna
s
dispatches
les
deux
routes
de
ponte
de
murcella
et
de
castello
branco
says
the
emperor
then
after
a
pause
et

nous
servirait
de
see
foy
s
the
castello
branco
road
therefore
with
this
dependent
the
estrada
nova
was
practically
left
out
of
consideration
by
the
marshal
there
remains
the
choice
between
the
two
northern
routes
and
de
both
traverse
rough
ground
but
ground
less
rough
than
that
to
be
found
on
some
parts
of
the
castello
branco
road
along
both
there
is
an
intermittent
belt
of
cultivated
land
and
not
unfrequent
villages
both
are
intersected
by
many
good
military
positions
on
which
a
defending
army
can
offer
battle
to
an
invader
with
advantage
in
especial
the
northern
road
strikes
and
climbs
the
granite
ridge
of
bussaco
with
every
disadvantage
for
the
attacking
side
and
the
southern
road
is
contracted
into
a
difficult
defile
at
the
passage
of
the
alva
near
ponte
de
murcella
on
the
whole
however
this
last
is
the
better
line
for
advance
the
strongest
testimonial
to
the
fact
is
that
wellington
expected
masséna
to
take
it
and
erected
at
the
passage
of
the
alva
almost
the
only
earthworks
save
those
of
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
which
he
constructed
in
his
preparations
for
the
reception
of
the
invader
when
he
first
heard
that
the
marshal
was
moving
forward
from
almeida
to
celorico
and
was
clearly
aiming
at
the
mondego
valley
he
announced
that
he
should
endeavour
to
stop
the
invader
on
the
alva
not
apparently
thinking
it
at
all
probable
that
masséna
would
move
by
vizeu
and
the
north
bank
of
the
mondego
on
realizing
that
this
was
really
his
adversary
s
design
he
observed
with
some
exultation
that
while
there
were
certainly
many
bad
roads
in
portugal
the
enemy
had
taken
decidedly
the
worst
of
those
open
to
him
moreover
he
had
committed
himself
to
attack
the
heights
of
bussaco
the
most
formidable
position
in
the
whole
of
northern
portugal
how
the
french
commander
came
to
make
this
choice
we
shall
discuss
in
its
proper
place
suffice
it
to
say
that
wellington
had
not
realized
how
bad
was
masséna
s
information
how
worthless
his
maps
and
what
is
most
surprising
of
all
how
entirely
destitute
of
local
knowledge
were
the
portuguese
traitors
alorna
pamplona
and
the
other
renegade
officers
whom
the
emperor
had
sent
as
guides
and
advisers
to
the
marshal
and
in
truth
the
unsuspected
ignorance
of
masséna
and
his
advisers
added
an
incalculable
element
of
chance
to
the
problem
set
before
wellington
he
was
obliged
to
make
his
plans
on
the
hypothesis
that
the
enemy
would
make
the
correct
move
and
not
unfrequently
the
enemy
for
reasons
which
the
english
general
could
not
possibly
foresee
made
the
wrong
one
there
were
some
others
thrown
up
on
the
extreme
lower
course
of
the
zezere
by
barca
nova
and
punhete
to
guard
against
a
possible
but
unlikely
use
of
the
castello
branco
road
by
the
enemy
wellington
to
hill
vi
wellington
to
chas
stuart
the
french
invasion
was
bound
to
commence
with
a
preliminary
clearance
of
the
outlying
fortresses
still
in
the
hands
of
the
spaniards
these
to
some
extent
protected
the
portuguese
frontier
in
though
they
had
been
built
with
the
express
purpose
not
of
protecting
but
of
threatening
it
and
had
never
before
been
attacked
by
an
enemy
coming
from
the
east
only
three
of
these
fortresses
were
of
any
importance
astorga

badajoz

spanish
succession
albuquerque
olivenza

either
not
in
a
state
of
defence
at
all
or
were
hopelessly
antiquated
and
little
suited
to
face
modern
artillery
and
modern
siegecraft
astorga
lies
so
far
to
the
north
that
it
might
have
been
neglected
without
much
peril
to
the
french
scheme
of
invasion
but
the
emperor
had
ordered
that
it
should
be
reduced
before
the
great
enterprise
began
it
gave
the
spanish
army
of
galicia
a
foothold
in
the
plains
of
leon
from
which
it
might
operate
against
masséna
s
rear
if
he
should
pass
it
by
its
capture
too
was
considered
a
matter
of
small
difficulty
for
it
was
but
a
mediaeval
walled
town
to
which
some
hasty
outworks
had
been
added
during
the
last
year
it
will
be
remembered
that
when
moore
passed
that
way
in
january
astorga
had
been
treated
by
both
sides
as
an
open
town
and
no
attempt
had
been
made
to
garrison
or
defend
it
since
then
la
romana
had
repaired
its
dilapidated
enceinte
stockaded
its
suburbs
and
armed
it
with
guns
brought
from
ferrol
as
late
as
january
napoleon
seems
hardly
aware
of
this
fact
in
a
dispatch
of
that
date
he
orders
loison
to
make
his
head
quarters
there
evidently
under
the
impression
that
it
is
not
held
by
the
spaniards
or
at
least
that
it
is
a
place
which
they
will
evacuate
at
the
first
appearance
of
a
serious
attack
it
is
only
in
march
that
he
writes
to
junot
that
astorga
must
be
besieged
and
taken
in
order
to
occupy
the
attention
of
the
galicians
and
to
thrust
them
back
into
their
mountains

a
more
serious

only
one
of

prestige

the
only

part
of
del
parque
s
army
of
the
left
marched
down
into
estremadura
in
january
in
order
to
replace
there
the
troops
which
had
gone
off
to
the
defence
of
cadiz
it
was
clear
that
ciudad
rodrigo
must
be
taken
and
martin
de
la
carrera
brushed
away
or
destroyed
before
any
serious
attempt
to
invade
portugal
was
begun
if
the
emperor
thought
that
such
a
remote
place
as
astorga
was
worth
his
notice
it
was
obvious
that
he
would
regard
ciudad
rodrigo
as
absolutely
indispensable
to
his
designs
it
was
for
its
reduction
that
he
gave
masséna
the
great
battering
train
of
fifty
heavy
guns
with
artillerymen
and
sappers
which
was
assigned
to
him
independent
of
the
artillery
of
the
three
corps
of
the
army
of
portugal
badajoz
far
to
the
south
in
spanish
estremadura
stood
to
the
defence
of
southern
portugal
exactly
as
ciudad
rodrigo
to
the
defence
of
northern
portugal
it
possessed
also
in
elvas
a
counterpart
to
almeida
but
badajoz
is
immensely
larger
and
stronger
than
rodrigo
just
as
elvas
is
infinitely
more
formidable
than
almeida
the
two
fortresses
on
the
frontier
of
leon
are
small
places
crowning
mere
mounds
set
in
a
plain
badajoz
and
elvas
have
towering
citadels
set
on
rugged
hills
and
overlooking
the
whole
they
have
also
strong
detached
forts
on
dominant
positions
the
circuit
of
ground
that
must
be
taken
up
by
an
army
that
intends
to
besiege
them
is
very
large
and
at
badajoz
there
is
a
river
the
guadiana
which
cuts
in
two
the
lines
which
the
assailant
must
occupy
it
may
be
added
that
based
on
badajoz
there
was
a
whole
spanish
army
of
men
not
a
mere
division
of
like
that
which
lurked
in
the
mountains
above
rodrigo
noting
the
strength
of
badajoz
and
elvas
the
emperor
had
made
up
his
mind
that
they
should
be
observed
and
contained
by
troops
from
the
army
of
andalusia
but
not
attacked
till
lisbon
had
been
conquered
and
the
english
expelled

he
wrote
in
a
holograph
minute
addressed
to
masséna
just
before
the
advance
across
the
portuguese
frontier
began
it
was
only
when
the
invasion
had
been
brought
to
a
standstill
before
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
that
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
pressure
must
be
applied
south
of
the
tagus
to
distract
wellington
and
that
soult
as
a
preliminary
to
an
attack
on
the
alemtejo
must
capture
badajoz
and
elvas
and
disperse
the
spanish
army
of
estremadura
the
idea
came
to
him
tardily
thanks
to
wellington
s
careful
starvation
of
the
main
french
army
masséna
was
forced
to
retreat
into
leon
when
soult
had
only
recently
captured
badajoz
and
had
not
yet
shown
a
man
in
front
of
elvas
the
scheme
was
hatched
like
so
many
of
napoleon
s
spanish
plans
about
three
months
too
late
for
effective
realization
as
late
as
november
the
orders
to
soult
are
merely
to
demonstrate
against
badajoz
and
to
hinder
the
departure
of
la
romana
s
army
for
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
but
not
to
besiege
the
estremaduran
fortress
probably
it
was
foy
s
information
as
to
the
existence
and
strength
of
the
unsuspected
lines
of
torres
vedras
which
reached
him
late
in
november
that
made
the
emperor
realize
the
advisability
of
that
secondary
attack
by
the
south
bank
of
the
tagus
which
wellington
had
foreseen
and
taken
means
to
meet
a
full
year
before
fortunately
a
capable
general
on
the
defensive
always
knows
his
own
weak
spots
long
before
they
are
discovered
by
the
enemy
by
the
time
that
soult
had
at
last
captured
badajoz
and
the
small
dependent
places

wellington
had
got
rid
of

from
the
neighbourhood
of

and
was
preparing

chase
him
home

northern

a

weeks
of
its
surrender
by
the
traitor
imaz
badajoz
was
being
besieged
by
a

of

had
his
hands

wellington
s
preparations
for
defence
as
far
back
as
september
while
his
army
still
lay
at
badajoz
and
the
talavera
campaign
was
hardly
over
wellington
had
foreseen
the
oncoming
invasion
of
portugal
which
did
not
actually
begin
till
august
writing
to
his
brother
then
on
his
special
mission
to
seville
he
had
laid
down
his
conclusions
bonaparte
would
in
consequence
of
the
cessation
of
the
austrian
war
be
enabled
to
pour
unlimited
reinforcements
into
spain
the
british
army
even
if
raised
to
men
would
not
be
strong
enough
to
cover
both
seville
and
lisbon
considering
the
temper
of
the
spanish
government
and
the
spanish
troops
he
thought
it
would
be
most
unadvisable
to
commit
himself
to
the
defence
of
andalusia
but
he
was
prepared
to
undertake
the
defence
of
portugal
he
implored
the
british
ministry
not
to
sacrifice
its
strong
position
on
the
tagus
in
order
to
embark
upon
a
hazardous
campaign
in
the
south
his
views
as
to
portugal
were
simply
the
development
of
those
which
he
had
drawn
up
for
castlereagh
s
eye
on
his
first
sailing
for
the
peninsula
portugal
though
all
frontier
might
be
defended
against
any
french
army
of
less
than
men
if
its
resources
were
placed
at
his
disposal
and
he
were
given
a
free
hand
to
utilize
them
according
to
his
own
plan
the
portland
cabinet
though
much
doubting
whether
wellington
could
carry
out
his
pledge
and
though
reluctant
to
abandon
the
idea
that
andalusia
might
be
defended
and
cadiz
made
secure
by
british
troops
finally
yielded
to
the
general
s
appeal
for
his
views
just
after
talavera
see

i
strongly
recommend
to
you
unless
you
mean
to
incur
the
risk
of
the
loss
of
your
army
not
to
have
anything
to
do
with
spanish
warfare
on
any
ground
whatever
in
the
existing
state
of
things
if
you
should
take
up
cadiz
you
must
lay
down
wellington
to
castlereagh
see
vol
ii
pages
but
on
december
the
portland
cabinet
gave
place
to
spencer
perceval
s
new
administration
and
wellington
had
to
reiterate
the
arguments
which
he
had
used
to
castlereagh
and
canning
to
new
correspondents
lord
liverpool
and
lord
bathurst
fortunately
the
incoming
ministers
resolved
to
adhere
to
the
promises
made
by
their
predecessors
and
to
persist
in
the
defence
of
portugal
it
was
of
immense
value
to
wellington
that
his
brother
wellesley
soon
replaced
lord
bathurst
at
the
foreign
office
so
that
he
could
command
in
this
ministry
a
supporter
as
firm
as
castlereagh
had
been
in
the
last
nevertheless
his
position
was
not
entirely
fortunate
the
new
administration
was
being
fiercely
assailed
by
the
whigs
over
the
general
policy
of
risking
british
armies
on
the
continent
the
calamities
of
the
walcheren
expedition
supplied
a
text
on
which
the
opposition
could
preach
interminable
sermons
the
men
who
were
not
ashamed
to
allege
for
party
reasons
that
wellington
was
a
rash
general
and
that
the
talavera
campaign
had
been
a
disaster
were
continually
harassing
the
ministry
by
their
suggestions
that
when
the
french
emperor
marched
in
person
to
spain
the
british
army
in
the
peninsula
must
inevitably
be
destroyed
it
was
probably
to
aid
them
that
napoleon
kept
inserting
in
the
articles
in
which
it
was
asserted
that
the
maintenance
of
the
incapable
sepoy
general
at
the
head
of
the
british
forces
was
the
thing
which
france
must
most
desire
in
lord
liverpool
s
correspondence
with
wellington
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
idea
that
it
might
be
necessary
to
evacuate
portugal
when
the
french
attack
was
delivered
almost
preponderated
over
that
of
preparing
for
the
defence
of
that
realm
while
wellington
s
whole
mind
is
set
on
working
out
the
details
of
a
campaign
from
which
he
hopes
great
things
his
correspondent
is
always
thinking
of
the
possibility
of
a
disastrous
embarkation
at
the
end
of
it
the
general
could
not
pledge
himself
that
portugal
might
be
defended
against
any
odds
whatever
it
was
possible
that
the
emperor
might
lead
or
send
against
him
an
army
of
absolutely
overpowering
strength
though
he
did
not
think
such
a
contingency
probable
but
since
he
could
not
say
that
his
position
was
impregnable
he
was
being
continually
worried
with
suggestions
as
to
all
the
possible
contingencies
that
might
occur
to
his
discomfiture
the
ministers
dreaded
that
the
peninsular
venture
might
end
in
a
fiasco
like
the
duke
of
york
s
dutch
expedition
of
and
thought
that
such
a
failure
would
lose
them
their
offices
hence
they
were
nervous
about
every
false
rumour
that
reached
them
from
france
concerning
the
emperor
s
approaching
departure
and
the
more
certain
information
about
the
immense
numbers
of
troops
that
were
passing
the
pyrenees
filled
them
with
dread
it
required
all
wellington
s
robust
to
keep
them
reassured
he
had
to
be
perpetually
repeating
to
them
that
all
his
preparations
for
retreat
and
embarkation
if
the
worst
should
happen
had
been
already
thought
out
they
might
make
up
their
minds
that
he
would
do
nothing
rash
but
he
was
inclined
to
think
that
there
would
in
the
end
be
no
need
to
depart
i
shall
delay
the
embarkation
he
wrote
as
long
as
it
is
in
my
power
and
shall
do
everything
that
is
in
my
power
to
avert
the
necessity
of
embarking
at
all
if
the
enemy
should
invade
this
country
with
a
force
less
than
that
which
i
should
think
so
superior
to
ours
as
to
create
a
necessity
for
embarking
i
shall
fight
a
battle
to
save
the
country
and
for
this
i
have
made
the
he
did
not
think
he
could
be
beaten
but
if
by
some
mischance
the
fortune
of
war
went
against
him
he
had
still
no
doubt
that
he
could
bring
off
the
army
in
safety
if
we
do
go
i
feel
a
little
anxiety
to
go
like
gentlemen
out
of
the
hall
door
particularly
after
all
the
preparations
i
have
made
to
enable
us
to
do
so
and
not
out
of
the
back
door
or
by
the
it
is
curious
to
find
that
in
this
most
interesting
dispatch
to
lord
liverpool
wellington
distinctly
asserts
that
his
worst
enemy
was
the
ghost
of
sir
john
moore
the
great
disadvantage
under
which
i
labour
is
that
sir
john
moore
who
was
here
before
me
gave
his
opinion
that
portugal
could
not
be
defended
by
the
army
under
his
command
it
is
obvious
that
the
country
was
in
a
very
different
situation
at
that
time
from
what
it
is
at
present
and
that
i
am
in
a
very
different
situation
from
that
in
which
he
found
himself
yet
persons
who
ought
to
be
better
acquainted
with
these
facts
entertain
a
certain
prejudice
against
the
adoption
of
any
plan
for
opposing
the
enemy
of
which
portugal
is
to
be
the
theatre
i
have
as
much
respect
as
any
man
for
the
opinion
and
judgement
of
sir
john
moore
and
i
should
mistrust
my
own
if
it
were
opposed
to
his
in
a
case
where
he
had
had
the
opportunity
of
knowing
and
considering
but
he
positively
knew
nothing
about
portugal
and
could
know
nothing
about
its
existing
state

all

quotations

from
wellington
to
lord
liverpool
april
a
long
dispatch
written
from
vizeu
every
word
of
which
is
well
worth
study
the
most
vexatious
thing
for
wellington
was
that
the
persons
who
ought
to
have
known
better
yet
were
perpetually
uttering
melancholy
vaticinations
as
to
the
approach
of
disaster
included
some
of
his
own
senior
officers
i
have
seen
a
letter
from
a
general
in
portugal
to
his
friend
in
england
containing
such
phrases
as
this
i
most
strongly
suspect
that
before
many
months
are
over
our
heads
there
will
be
no
opportunity
for
this
employment
that
of
a
cavalry
brigadier
left
to
on
the
continent
at
least
the
next
campaign
will
close
the
eventful
scene
in
the
peninsula
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
for
i
am
decidedly
of
opinion
that
neither
marshal
wellington
nor
marshal
beresford
will
prevent
the
approaching
subjugation
of
or
again
i
am
quite
surprised
at
lord
s
pliant
disposition
i
suspect
he
feels
himself
tottering
on
his
throne
and
wishes
to
conciliate
at
any
sacrifice
the
frequent
complaints
in
wellington
s
correspondence
as
to
the
sort
of
letters
that
were
going
home
to
england
in
the
spring
of
sufficiently
show
that
these
views
were
not
uncommon
among
his
subordinates
if
the
generals
on
the
spot
foresaw
disaster
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
ministers
in
london
felt
anxious
and
refused
to
be
comforted
by
the
confident
dispatches
of
the
i
found
these
passages
in
letters
to
sir
john
le
marchant
then
in
command
at
the
staff
college
at
high
wycombe
from
a
friend
in
portugal
it
is
notable
that
other
contemporary
epistles
from
younger
men
old
pupils
of
le
marchant
show
a
far
more
cheery
spirit
the
correspondence
from
which
i
shall
have
many
other
passages
to
quote

placed
at
my
disposition
by
the
kindness

the
preparations
which
wellington
was
making
during
the
winter
of
and
the
ensuing
spring
for
the
reception
of
the
inevitable
french
invasion
may
be
arranged
in
the
main
under
three
heads
we
must
first
treat
of
the
complete
reorganization
of
the
portuguese
military
forces
not
only
the
regulars
but
the
militia
and
the
old
en
of
the
ordenança
second
come
the
elaborate
plans
for
the
construction
of
enormous
for
the
protection
of
lisbon
the
famous
lines
of
torres
vedras
and
the
fortification
of
certain
other
and
more
advanced
points
the
third
and
in
some
ways
the
most
important
of
all
was
the
arrangement
of
the
great
scheme
for
devastating
the
in
front
of
the
invader
and
fighting
him
by
the
weapon
of
starvation
a
device
new
to
the
french
but
not
unprecedented
in
the
earlier
history
of
portugal
the
portuguese
regular
army
had
taken
hardly
any
part
in
the
campaigns
of
the
only
sections
of
it
that
had
been
under
fire
were
silveira
s
two
regiments
the
four
battalions
that
marched
with
wellington
to
oporto
in
may
and
wilson
s
loyal
lusitanian
legion
which
had
fought
with
more
valour
than
success
at
the
bridge
of
alcantara
and
the
pass
of
baños
beresford
with
the
greater
part
of
the
troops
that
were
in
a
condition
to
take
the
field
had
been
out
on
the
border
in
july
and
had
remained
for
some
days
in
spain
on
the
side
of
coria
and
zarza
mayor
but
he
had
never
been
in
contact
with
the
enemy
the
fighting
power
of
the
reorganized
portuguese
army
was
still
a
doubtful
quantity
see
vol
ii
pages
and
see
vol
ii
pages
beresford
had
some
men
with
him
the
of
the
portuguese
regular
forces
should
have
been
according
to
its
establishments
men
in
september
there
were
only
men
with
the
colours
and
of
these
much
more
than
half
were
recruits
who
had
recently
been
thrust
into
the
depleted
of
the
old
army
there
were
many
regiments
which
had
been
practically
destroyed
by
the
french
and
which
showed
when
beresford
first
marched
out
to
the
frontier
only
or
men
instead
of
their
normal
many
others
had
less
than
half
their
complement
the
first
thing
that
required
to
be
done
was
to
fill
up
the
gaps
and
this
was
accomplished
during
the
winter
of
by
a
stringent
use
of
the
conscription
law
already
existing
the
line
regiments
in
the
bussaco
campaign
showed
with
hardly
an
exception
or
effectives
present
if
the
sick
and
details
are
added
they
were
nearly
or
quite
up
to
their
establishment
of
the
cavalry
was
less
effective
the
number
of
men
could
be
filled
up
but
horses
were
hard
to
find
and
in
the
end
wellington
sent
four
of
the
twelve
regiments
to
do

only
one

was
the

as
practically
a

before
it

only

the
rest
had

the
strongest
regiment
was
the
with
men
mere
numbers
are
no
test
of
the
efficiency
of
a
host
the
weak
point
of
the
old
national
army
had
been
as
we
mentioned
in
another
place
the
effete
and
unmilitary
character
of
its
body
of
officers
more
especially
of
its
senior
officers
the
junior
ranks
filled
up
since
the
french
invasion
with
young
men
who
had
taken
up
the
military
career
from
patriotic
motives
were
infinitely
better
by
the
second
year
of
the
war
there
were
many
admirable
officers
among
them
but
it
was
men
capable
of
handling
a
battalion
or
a
regiment
that
were
wanting
we
saw
how
beresford
had
been
forced
to
introduce
many
british
officers
into
the
service
though
he
was
aware
that
the
personal
pride
of
the
portuguese
officers
was
bitterly
hurt
thereby
his
justification
may
be
deduced
from
a
confidential
memorandum
written
for
him
by
his
benjamin
d
urban
which
is
well
worth
quoting
see
vol
ii
pages
this
unpublished
document
here
quoted
along
with
the
whole
of
sir
benjamin
s
journal
and
correspondence
has
been
placed
at
my
disposal
by
his
grandson
d
urban
they
are
invaluable
for
the
portuguese
aspect
of
the
war
there
are
yet
among
the
field
officers
captains
and
older
subalterns
a
number
of
incorrigible
officers
of
the
old
school
who
are
a
dead
weight
upon
their
respective
regiments
and
mischievous
in
the
way
of
example
whenever
it
may
be
thought
expedient
from
time
to
time
to
get
rid
of
them
there
will
be
no
difficulty
in
finding
excellent
young
men
to
replace
them
from
the
ranks
respectively
below
but
i
feel
it
incumbent
upon
me
to
give
it
you
as
my
decided
opinion
resulting
from
a
close
investigation
into
the
causes
of
the
defects
of
the
portuguese
that
it
will
be
utterly
impossible
either
to
make
a
regiment
fit
for
service
or
to
preserve
it
when
made
so
without
giving
it
an
english
and
at
least
two
english
captains
the
portuguese
soldier
is
naturally
indolent
he
falls
with
the
greatest
facility
into
slouching
and
slovenly
habits
unless
he
is
constantly
roused
and
forced
to
exert
himself
but
many
a
portuguese
officer
if
not
constantly
spurred
and
urged
to
do
his
duty
is
at
least
as
indolent
as
his
men
nothing
i
am
persuaded
by
experience
will
counteract
this
and
create
activity
among
the
officers
and
consequent
diligence
and
care
among
the
men
but
the
strictness
energy
and
vigilance
of
an
english
even
supposing
a
sufficient
energy
of
character
in
the
native
officer
he
does
not
and
will
not
if
he
be
not
a
himself
exercise
coercive
or
strong
measures
to
oblige
one
of
that
class
to
do
his
duty
he
is
aware
that
in
doing
so
he
makes
a
powerful
enemy
and
all
the
habits
of
thought
in
which
he
has
been
educated
inspire
him
with
such
a
dread
of
this
that
no
sense
of
duty
will
urge
him
to
encounter
it
thus
whenever
a
regiment
is
commanded
by
a
it
never
fails
to
suffer
extremely
for
the
noblemen
are
permitted
to
do
as
they
please
and
afford
a
very
bad
example
for
they
are
at
least
as
indolent
as
the
ordinary
portuguese
the
english
captains
will
be
found
invaluable
especially
in
the
hands
of
an
english
commandant
their
example
is
infinitely
useful
the
portuguese
captains
are
piqued
into
activity
and
attention
when
they
see
their
companies
excelled
in
efficiency
by
those
of
the
english
and
they
do
from
emulation
what
a
sense
of
duty
would
perhaps
never
bring
them
to
there
are
a
variety
of
and
oblique
means
by
which
the
parts
of
a
portuguese
corps
are
constantly
and
almost
insensibly
endeavouring
to
return
to
the
old
habits
that
they
are
so
much
attached
to
to
nip
this
from
time
to
time
in
the
bud
it
is
necessary
to
be
aware
of
it
without
the
faithful
surveillance
of
english
subordinate
officers
who
ever
mixing
with
the
mass
of
the
men
can
t
well
be
ignorant
of
what
is
going
on
the
can
rarely
be
warned
in
beresford
replied
that
all
this
was
true
but
that
the
national
feeling
required
management
and
that
to
place
every
regimental
or
brigade
command
in
british
hands
would
provoke
such
fierce
jealousy
that
he
was
compelled
to
humour
the
prejudices
and
satisfy
the
pride
of
the
his
device
for
doing
this
was
to
make
a
general
rule
that
wherever
a
portuguese
officer
was
in
chief
command
he
should
have
a
british
officer
second
in
command
under
him
and
vice
versa
when
a
brigade
was
given
to
a
portuguese
he
managed
that
the
two
colonels
of
the
regiments
forming
it
should
be
englishmen
similarly
if
a
portuguese
commanded
a
regiment
his
senior
major
was
always
an
englishman
by
this
means
it
was
secured
that
a
fair
half
of
the
higher
pieces
of
promotion
should
be
left
to
the
native
officers
but
that
every
portuguese
placed
in
a
responsible
position
should
have
a
british
officer
at
his
back
in
addition
there
were
from
two
to
four
british
captains
in
each
battalion
but
no
subalterns
for
to
encourage
good
men
to
volunteer
into
the
portuguese
service
it
was
provided
that
all
who
did
so
should
receive
a
step
of
promotion
and
a
british
lieutenant
became
a
portuguese
captain
on
exchange
and
a
british
captain
a
portuguese
major
the
system
seems
to
have
worked
well
and
with
far
less
friction
than
might
have
been
expected
the
better
class
of
native
officers
were
piqued
into
emulation
just
as
d
urban
had
expected
the
worst
was
gradually
eliminated
it
must
be
noted
that
to
every
battalion
there
were
added
one
or
two
british
sergeants
whose
services
were
needed
for
the
drilling
of
the
men
in
the
english
exercises
which
now
superseded
the
old
german
system
left
behind
by
la
lippe
the
last
reorganizer
of
the
portuguese
army
for
the
whole
drill
of
the
infantry
was
changed
and
the
british
formations
and
manœuvres
introduced
dundas
s
eighteen
manœuvres
were
translated
and
became
the
bible
of
the
lusitanian
no
less
than
the
british
officer
the
employment
of
the
line
the
essential
feature
of
the
system
was
made
the
base
of
all
portuguese
drill
at
bussaco
it
justified
itself
the
caçadores
were
trained
on
the
rifle
regulations
of
coote
manningham
and
their
uniform
was
modified
in
cut
though
not
in
colour
to
a
close
resemblance
of
that
of
the
british
rifleman
the
net
result
of
all
these
changes
was
that
for
the
future
the
british
and
portuguese
units
of
wellington
s
army
could
be
moved
by
the
same
words
of
command
and
in
the
same
formations
and
that
all
the
disadvantages
resulting
from
the
coexistence
of
two
different
systems
of
drill
disappeared
this
rule
i
find
definitely
laid
down
in
a
letter
of
hardinge
beresford
s
written
as
late
as
but
the
practice
was
already
in
full
use
by
for
narratives
of
the
daily
life
of
a
british
officer
in
a
portuguese
regiment
see
bunbury
s
of
a
and
blakiston
s
years
of
military
both
had
their
difficulties
but
both
on
the
whole
got
on
well
with
their
colleagues
d
urban
s
correspondence
supplies
a
frequent
commentary
on
regimental
problems
how
this
was
done
may
be
read
in
blakiston
see
bunbury
they
were
dressed
in
dark
brown
instead
of
in
the
rifle
green
the
shako
coat
and
trousers
were
of
the
british
model
two
principal
difficulties
still
remained
in
the
administration
of
the
portuguese
army
the
first
was
what
to
do
with
the
few
senior
officers
of
undoubted
patriotism
but
more
doubtful
capacity
who
were
too
important
and
influential
to
be
placed
upon
the
shelf
yet
might
cause
a
disaster
if
placed
in
a
critical
position
of
responsibility
the
most
notable
of
them
was
silveira
who
had
acquired
much
popularity
by
his
obstinate
if
resistance
to
soult
in
the
spring
of
wellington
with
many
searchings
of
heart
placed
him
in
command
of
the
where
it
was
most
unlikely
that
any
serious
irruption
of
the
french
would
take
place
he
had
a
large
force
placed
under
him
but
it
did
not
include
a
single
regular
regiment
and
with
militia
only
at
his
disposition
it
was
hoped
that
he
would
be
discouraged
from
attempting
any
hazardous
experiments
moreover
he
was
given
a
british
first
john
wilson
and
afterwards
miller
to
curb
his
eccentricities
so
far
as
was
possible
baccelar
another
officer
of
doubtful
merit
but
more
dangerous
from
torpidity
than
from
rashness
was
given
charge
of
the
militia
of
the
three
northern
provinces
so
that
silveira
was
technically
under
his
orders
though
the
nominal
subordinate
would
seem
to
have
paid
little
attention
to
his
superior
the
most
important
post
however
assigned
to
a
portuguese
officer
was
the
governorship
of
elvas
the
strongest
fortress
of
portugal
and
one
which
would
stand
in
the
forefront
of
the
battle
if
the
french
made
the
subsidiary
invasion
south
of
the
tagus
which
wellington
was
inclined
to
expect
the
command
of
this
great
stronghold
and
the
men
of
its
garrison
of
whom
half
were
regulars
was
given
to
general
leite
an
active
and
ingenious
officer
and
what
was
more
important
a
man
who
obeyed
orders
of
all
the
portuguese
he
was
the
one
whom
wellington
most
trusted
every
british
narrator
of
the
war
who
came
in
contact
with
him
has
a
word
of
praise
in
his
behalf
of
the
other
native
generals
lecor
in
command
of
a
division
and
fonseca
in
command
of
a
brigade
were
with
the
field
army
miranda
was
given
charge
of
the
militia
of
northern
estremadura
who
were
likely
to
be
in
the
thickest
of
the
trouble
but
the
other
portuguese
units
of
the
allied
host
were
under
british
officers
pack
archibald
and
alexander
campbell
macmahon
coleman
harvey
collins
and
bradford
had
charge
of
the
regular
brigades
of
the
field
army
the
native
generals
save
those
above
mentioned
were
placed
in
administrative
posts
or
in
charge
of
those
sections
of
the
militia
which
were
probably
destined
to
see
no
service
silveira
was
the
despair
of
beresford
and
his
d
urban
the
latter
writes
apr
this
general
is
the
most
extraordinary
of
all
the
people
in
this
extraordinary
country
perpetually
fluctuating
incapable
of
standing
still
always
wishing
to
move
backward
or
forward
all
his
movements
to
no
purpose
but
that
of
harassing
his
troops
the
man
is
either
very
weak
or
very
designing
perhaps
both
anyhow
he
is
a
mischievous
charlatan
and
i
wish
the
marshal
would
not
yield
to
the
prejudices
of
the
people
by
employing
the
second
point
of
difficulty
in
the
organization
of
the
portuguese
army
was
the
commissariat
in
the
old
days
it
had
been
a
purely
civilian
branch
of
the
service
intendants
dealing
with
contractors
and
merchants
for
this
had
been
substituted
a
de
mainly
composed
of
officers
which
proved
as
ineffective
if
not
as
corrupt
as
the
body
which
had
preceded
it
the
british
government
had
taken
over
the
responsibility
of
paying
half
the
portuguese
army
but
not
that
of
feeding
it
and
despite
of
the
handsome
subsidies
that
it
paid
to
the
regency
for
the
general
purposes
of
the
war
the
native
troops
especially
those
quartered
far
from
lisbon
were
often
in
a
state
of
the
portuguese
corps
ought
to
have
a
commissariat
attached
to
them
and
i
believe
each
brigade
has
a
commissary
wrote
wellington
but
they
have
no
magazines
and
no
money
to
purchase
supplies
one
main
difficulty
arose
from
the
fact
that
the
junta
de
viveres
shrank
from
the
heavy
expense
of
organizing
a
proper
transport
train
and
tried
to
make
shift
with
requisitioned
carts
and
oxen
which
were
difficult
to
get
since
the
british
army
was
competing
with
the
portuguese
for
draught
animals
and
still
harder
to
retain
for
the
peasant
driver
always
absconded
with
his
beasts
when
he
found
an
opportunity
another
difficulty
was
that
the
junta
tried
to
feed
the
troops
with
requisitioned
corn
instead
of
paying
for
it
with
money
down
hence
it
got
grudging
service
i
know
from
experience
observes
wellington
that
the
portuguese
army
could
not
be
in
the
distress
under
which
it
suffers
from
want
of
provisions
if
only
a
part
of
the
food
it
receives
from
the
country
were
paid
and
he
suggested
as
a
remedy
that
the
british
ministers
should
earmark
part
of
the
subsidy
for
use
on
the
commissariat
and
no
other
purpose
it
was
long
before
this
matter
was
set
to
rights
beresford
s
correspondence

bristles
with
complaints
as
to
the
inefficiency

wellington
to
villiers
d
urban
writes
may
such
is
the
poverty
imbecility
and
want
of
arrangement
of
the
portuguese
government
that
any
regular
system
of
supply
is
not
to
be
expected
the
whole
civil
branch
of
the
army
is
in
such
a
state
of
confusion
that
i
hold
it
impossible
to
carry
on
active
operations
for
more
than
a
few
if
the
regular
army
was
badly
fed
so
that
desertion
and
sickness
were
both
too
prevalent
in
some
corps
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
the
militia
would
fare
better
wellington
had
ordered
and
beresford
had
arranged
for
the
embodiment
of
every
one
of
the
militia
regiments
of
the
national
establishment
they
should
properly
have
given
men
but
such
a
figure
was
never
reached
some
of
the
regimental
districts
were
too
thinly
peopled
to
give
the
full
men
at
which
each
was
assessed
in

the
officers
placed
in

were
incapable

local

not

that

all
these

were
entirely
unfitted

wellington
refused
to

them

save
in
the

he
directed
the
brigadiers
never
to
risk
them
in
battle
even
against
a
much
inferior
force
of
the
french
their
sole
purpose
was
to
cut
lines
of
communication
to
render
marauding
by
the
enemy
s
small
detachments
impossible
and
to
restrict
his
power
of
making
reconnaissances
far
afield
they
were
told
that
they
might
defend
a
pass
or
a
ford
for
a
time
so
as
to
delay
the
advance
of
a
hostile
column
but
that
they
were
never
to
commit
themselves
to
a
serious
combat
with
any
considerable
body
convoys
stragglers
small
detachments
were
the
game
on
which
they
must
prey
the
programme
was
not
a
brilliant
one
to
lay
down
before
an
ambitious
officer
and
more
than
once
silveira
trant
and
wilson
disobeyed
orders
and
tried
to
withstand
a
full
french
division
in
some
chosen
position
such
experiments
almost
always
ended
in
a
disaster
it
was
not
surprising
for
the
militia
were
not
troops
from
whom
much
could
be
expected
the
best
men
in
every
district
had
been
taken
for
the
regular
army
all
the
trained
officers
were
also
needed
there
the
militia
were
composed
of
civilians
who
had
to
learn
their
duties
just
as
much
as
the
privates
whom
they
were
supposed
to
instruct
all
the
patriotic
and
energetic
young
men
of
the
governing
classes
had
sought
commissions
in
the
line
the
less
willing
and
active
were
driven
into
the
militia
service
therein
brought
neither
much
credit
nor
much
promotion
if
the
regency
the
regulars
it
the
militia
which
was
normally
in
a
state
of
destitution
of
clothing
shoes
and
food
hardly
a
regiment
was
provided
with
uniforms
as
a
rule
only
the
officers
showed
the
regulation
blue
and
silver
as
long
as
the
corps
was
in
its
own
district
it
was
fed
somehow
but
when
moved
to
some
strategical
point
in
the
rugged
mountains
of
the
beira
it
was
liable
to
go
wholly
to
pieces
from
sheer
privation
fortunately
the
portuguese
peasant
led
a
frugal
life
at
all
times
and
expected
little
the
desertion
though
large
was
not
nearly
so
great
as
might
have
been
expected
the
fact
was
that
the
men
were
essentially
loyal
and
hated
the
french
with
a
perfect
hatred
they
might
be
very
poor
soldiers
but
they
were
very
bitter
personal
enemies
of
the
invader
nevertheless
they
were
liable
to
panics
on
very
slight
provocation
at
the
best
they
are
a
very
daily
and
uncertain
sort
of
fighting
people
remarked
one
of
their
leaders
another
wrote
in
a
more
forcible
language
scripture
says
put
not
your
trust
in

i
say

the
man
who
puts
his
trust

damnable

of
these
sentences
was
indited
the
day
after
a
disastrous
and
wholly
unnecessary
rout
d
urban
to
wilson
and
trant
to
wilson
after
two
unfortunate
incidents
in
when
the
militia
had
been
more
or
less
under
arms
for
two
whole
years
the
former

the
latter

portuguese
military
system
contemplated
the
utilization
of
the
whole
en
of
the
nation
under
the
name
of
the
ordenança
this
was
no
foreshadowing
of
the
modern
idea
of
universal
service
but
a
survival
of
the
mediaeval
practice
which
in
portugal
as
in
england
made
every
freeman
liable
to
be
called
out
in
time
of
extremity
at
his
own
cost
and
with
his
own
weapons
every
peasant
between
sixteen
and
sixty
was
theoretically
supposed
to
be
enrolled
in
one
of
the
companies
of
which
each
group
of

was
supposed
to
possess

been
effective
enough
in
the
old
mediaeval
wars

had
even
proved
serviceable
in
the
war
of
independence
that
followed
the
successful
rising
of
but
against
modern
regular
armies
it
was
comparatively
useless
when
called
out
in
the
war
of
the
ordenança
had
not
justified
its
old
reputation
little
could
be
expected
of
mobs
armed
with
pikes
and
save
that
they
should
cut
off
a
few
convoys
and
stragglers
or
occasionally
obstruct
a
defile
a
french
officer
who
deeply
studied
this
forgotten
campaign
wrote
that
whatever
the
spaniards
may
say
to
the
contrary
this
war
of
the
peasantry
is
by
no
means
important
except
against
ignorant
and
undisciplined
troops
dumouriez
of

there
was
however
one
notable
combat
at
villa
pouca
in
the
where
a
whole
spanish
column
of
men
was
defeated
by
the
ordenança
when
wellington
resolved
to
call
out
the
ordenança
in
he
was
ignorant
of
none
of
these
facts
nevertheless
he
insisted
that
the
regency
should
issue
the
old
royal
ordinance
to
call
out
the
levy
his
object
was
threefold
from
the
political
and
moral
point
of
view
it
was
necessary
to
take
this
measure
because
it
was
the
ancient
and
established
method
of
proclaiming
that
the
country
was
in
danger
it
was
so
understood
by
the
peasantry
in
whose
memories
the
traditions
of
the
spanish
invasions
were
still
fresh
they
expected
to
be
summoned
and
would
have
doubted
the
imminence
of
the
emergency
if
they
had
not
been
the
call
was
at
once
an
appeal
to
their
patriotism
and
equivalent
to
a
proclamation
of
martial
law
secondly
wellington
hoped
to
find
assistance
to
a
certain
degree
for
the
work
which
he
had
set
aside
for
the
militia
by
the
aid
of
the
ordenança
pervading
the
whole
and
knowing
every
and
inaccessible
fastness
their
motley
companies
would
surround
the
invading
army
as
it
marched
prevent
marauding
by
small
parties
and
render
between
columns
impossible
save
by
large
detachments
french
narrators
of
the
campaign
speak
of
the
cruel
callousness
with
which
wellington
exposed
these
peasants
to
the
wrath
of
the
most
efficient
army
in
the
world
and
wax
sentimental
over
the
miseries
of
the
portuguese
but
sentiment
from
such
a
quarter
is
suspicious
it
is
absurd
to
find
old
soldiers
writing
as
if
the
main
duty
of
a
general
defending
a
country
were
to
spare
its
peasantry
as
much
inconvenience
as
possible
did
not
napoleon
in
make
every
endeavour
to
raise
lorraine
and
champagne
in
the
rear
of
the
allies
and
has
any
french
critic
ever
blamed
him
for
doing
so
was
the
actual
misery
suffered
by
the
inhabitants
of
beira
so
much
greater
than
what
they
would
have
endured
if
they
had
remained
at
home
and
offered
no
resistance
the
would
have
been
stripped
bare
by
an
army
forced
to
make
war
support
war
and
one
can
hardly
believe
judging
from
parallel
incidents
in
spain
that
outrages
would
have
been
conspicuous
by
their
absence
but
it
would
seem
that
the
third
of
wellington
s
reasons
for
calling
out
the
ordenança
was
far
more
cogent
and
lay
nearer
to
the
heart
of
his
scheme
than
the
other
two
throughout
portuguese
history
the
summons
to
the
levy
had
always
been
combined
with
another
measure
from
which
indeed
it
could
not
be
disentangled
the
order
to
the
whole
population
to
evacuate
and
devastate
the
land
in
face
of
the
advancing
enemy
the
use
of
the
weapon
of
starvation
against
the
french
was
an
essential
part
of
wellington
s
plan
for
defending
portugal
when
he
told
the
british
ministry
that
he
would
undertake
the
defence
of
the
realm
this
was
one
of
the
main
conditions
of
his
pledge
he
had
realized
the
great
fact
that
the
conduct
of
the
war
in
the
peninsula
depended
on
supplies
the
old
aphorism
that
beyond
the
pyrenees
large
armies
starve
and
small
armies
get
beaten
was
at
the
back
of
all
his
schemes
for
the
year
he
calculated
that
the
french
would
find
the
greatest
difficulty
in
accumulating
stores
sufficient
to
feed
an
army
of
invasion
large
enough
to
attack
portugal
and
that
even
if
such
stores
could
be
gathered
there
would
be
a
still
greater
difficulty
in
getting
them
to
the
front
as
they
were
needed
for
not
only
would
it
be
hard
to
collect
the
mass
of
transport
required
for
an
army
of
or
men
but
the
convoys
which
it
formed
would
find
it
impossible
to
move
over
the
vast
stretch
of
bad
roads
between
salamanca
and
lisbon
when
the
communications
were
cut
and
the
militia
and
ordenança
were
infesting
every
pass
and
hillside
it
was
almost
certain
that
the
invaders
would
make
no
such
attempt
to
feed
themselves
from
the
rear
but
would
start
with
a
moderate
train
carrying
no
more
than
provisions
for
a
week
or
two
and
hoping
to
subsist
in
the
usual
french
style
on
the
resources
of
the
invaded
country
such
resources
wellington
was
determined
that
they
should
not
find
they
would
ere
long
be
starved
out
and
forced
to
fall
back
on
their
magazines
certainly
losing
a
large
proportion
of
their
men
from
privations
by
the
way
if
this
scheme
had
been
carried
out
with
rigid
perfection
masséna
s
invasion
would
have
amounted
to
no
more
than
a
promenade
to
torres
vedras
and
a
prompt
return
to
the
borders
of
spain
with
a
famished
army
unfortunately
the
device
though
it
worked
well
and
was
ultimately
quite
successful
was
not
perfectly
executed
in
every
corner
and
by
every
subordinate
so
that
the
french
showing
a
magnificent
obstinacy
and
suffering
untold
privations
remained
before
the
lines
for
three
months
before
they
retired
but
retire
they
did
and
with
a
loss
of
a
third
of
their
army
and
a
deplorable
decadence
of
their
morale
so
that
wellington
s
scheme
was
fully
justified
unlike
the
many
french
writers
who
content
themselves
with
denouncing
wellington
s
inhumanity
pelet
masséna

chief

that

measures

had
been
taken
in
for
withdrawing
all
food
and
transport
from
the
south
coast
of
england
if
napoleon
should
be
successful
in
crossing
from
boulogne
it
was
an
ancient
portuguese
device
practised
from
time
immemorial
against
the
castilian
invader
which
had
never
failed
of
success
nor
had
it
come
to
an
end
with
the
war
of
independence

war

had
made
her
last
serious
assault

miserable
of

plan

worked
admirably

country
had
been
driven
in
the
most
systematic
style
and
everything
that
could
not
be
carried
off
had
been
destroyed
so
that
the
spaniard
found
himself
in
a
desert
being
unable
to
discover
either

or

the
inhabitants
had
abandoned

villages
and
carried
off
everything

migration
of
but
was
actually
written
in
it
is
clear
then
that
wellington
did
not
invent
the
system
of
devastation
but
simply
utilized
and
carried
out
to
its
logical
end
an
old
custom
essentially
national
and
familiar
to
the
portuguese
from
time
immemorial
it
was
the
regular
device
of
the
weak
against
the
strong
in
the
middle
ages
and
differed
in
nothing
from

fortunately

wellington
had
to
deal
with
a
peasantry
almost
as
frugal
as
tough
and
as
stubborn
in
their
hatred
as
the
mediaeval
scot
they
saw
nothing
strange
in
the
demand
now
made
to
them
and
obeyed
the
difficulty
lay
with
the
townsfolk
of
large
places
such
as
coimbra
thomar
or
santarem
which
lay
far
from
the
frontier
and
had
not
the
old
traditions
of
the
peasantry
since
the
spaniards
had
never
penetrated
to
their
doors
since
the
seventeenth
century
here
there
was
much
recalcitrance
as
was
but
natural
the
burgher
had
much
to
abandon
where
the
peasant
had
little
yet
as
we
shall
see
the
scheme
was
carried
out
in
the
end
and
those
who
stayed
behind
to
greet
the
french
could
be
counted
on
one
hand
in
places
of
the
size
of
vizeu
coimbra
or
leiria
that
fanatical
patriotism
went
far
towards
producing
such
a
result
is
true
but
does
not
explain
the
whole
matter
quite
as
strong
a
motive
was
the
unforgotten
tale
of
the
horrors
that
had
followed
soult
s
entry
into
oporto
to
the
portuguese
citizens
the
approach
of
the
french
meant
probable
murder
and
rape
hence
came
the
readiness
that
they
showed
to
depart

exaggerated

abroad

the
ruthlessness
of

and
mostly
false
stories
were
told
known
to
be
in
high
command
wellington
s
scheme
for
the
clearing
of
the
in
face
of
the
enemy
had
long
been
thought
out
it
included
not
merely
the
evacuation
of
the
towns
and
villages
but
the
destruction
of
bridges
mills
even
ovens
the
removal
of
all
animals
and
means
of
transport
the
destruction
of
all
that
could
not
be
carried
off
the
burning
of
all
and
other
small
craft
on
the
navigable
rivers
the
moment
that
the
enemy
crosses
the
frontier
he
wrote
to
beresford
the
governor
of
the
province
of
estremadura
must
be
told
that
it
is
necessary
to
order
all
carts
carriages
and
other
means
of
conveyance
with
all
the
provisions
they
can
carry
away
he
ought
to
have
all
his
arrangements
prepared
for
ordering
them
off
as
soon
as
the
french
approach
the
captains
mor
and
their
ordenança
must
be
prepared
to
give
the
enemy
all
the
opposition
in
their
power
not
by
assembling
in
large
bodies
but
by
lying
out
in
the
mountains
and
the
strong
parts
of
the
roads
annoying
their
patrols
and
small
parties
and
interrupting
their
communications
this
comes
from
an
order
of
february
by
august
when
a
new
harvest
had
been
gathered
in
the
question
of
the
destruction
of
food
stuffs
became
more
difficult
the
peasantry
as
was
natural
persisted
in
hiding
rather
than
burning
what
could
not
be
carried
off
by
one
means
or
another
a
certain
number
of
these
concealed
stores
even
when
buried
in
pits
or
removed
to
remote
ravines
were
discovered
by
the
french
and
enabled
them
to
prolong
their
precarious
stay
in
front
of
the
torres
vedras
lines
for
these
officers
and
their
duties
see
vol
ii
pp
wellington
to
beresford
vizeu
long
before
the
actual
invasion
as
to
the
displacement
of
the
population
wellington
considered
that
in
many
parts
it
would
be
sufficient
if
it
took
to
the
hills
for
a
few
days
while
the
french
army
was
passing
his
military
arrangements
were
such
that
he
thought
it
impossible
that
the
enemy
would
be
able
either
to
leave
small
posts
behind
him
or
to
maintain
his
lines
of
communication
with
spain
it
would
suffice
therefore
that
the
peasantry
in
parts
off
the
main
roads
and
remote
from
large
towns
or
points
of
strategical
importance
should
make
ready
for
a
merely
temporary
migration
they
must
always
however
be
ready
to
flit
again
if
fresh
columns
of
the
enemy
advancing
or
retreating
should
come
near
their
abodes
the
townsfolk
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
fertile
coast
plains
of
estremadura
and
western
beira
were
recommended
to
retire
either
to
lisbon
or
to
oporto
according
as
they
were
nearer
to
one
or
to
the
other
it
was
clear
that
the
problem
of
feeding
them
there
would
be
a
matter
for
the
government
for
individuals
of
the
poorer
classes
could
not
be
expected
to
carry
or
to
buy
provisions
for
many
weeks
hence
there
was
a
need
for
the
accumulation
of
immense
stores
over
and
above
those
required
for
the
army
the
portuguese
regency
did
what
it
could
but
in
its
usual
and
inefficient
fashion
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
much
misery
and
a
certain
amount
of
starvation
fell
to
the
lot
of
the
unhappy
emigrants
fortunately
lisbon
and
oporto
were
great
ports
and
full
of
food
but
despite
of
this
the
position
of
the
refugees
became
deplorable
when
masséna
tarried
at
santarem
two
months
longer
than
wellington
had
considered
probable
but
their
suffering
was
not
in
vain
the
french
were
starved
out
even
if
it
was
a
few
weeks
later
than
had
been
expected
having
dealt
with
the
organization
of
the
military
force
of
portugal
and
the
arrangements
for
the
depopulation
of
the
country
we
have
still
to
explain
the
third
section
of
wellington
s
great
scheme
of
defence
that
consisting
of
fortifications
we
have
already
mentioned
that
almeida
and
elvas
had
been
repaired
and
garrisoned
the
former
with
men
consisting
of
one
regiment
of
regulars
and
three
of
militia
under
the
english
general
william
cox
the
other
by
men
two
regiments
of
regulars
and
five
of
militia
under
general
leite
these
were
the
outer
bulwarks
of
the
realm
campo
mayor
a
small
and
antiquated
fortress
a
sort
of
outlying
dependency
of
elvas
was
held
by
one
militia
battalion
under
a
colonel
talaya
a
retired
engineer
officer
it
was
not
expected
to
make
a
serious
resistance
but
did
so
in
the
time
of
need
and
detained
a
french
division
before
its
walls
for
some
precious
days
in
the
spring
of
to
the
great
glory
and
credit
of
its
governor
only
two
other
of
the
ancient
fortresses
of
portugal
were
placed
in
a
state
of
defence
and
made
to
play
a
notable
part
in
wellington
s
general
scheme
for
checking
the
french
these
were
peniche
and
abrantes
the
former
is
a
very
strong
isolated
on
a
projecting
headland
in
the
atlantic
forty
miles
north
of
lisbon
it
commands
several
good
creeks
and
suitable
for
the
embarkation
and
disembarkation
of
troops
and
is
nearly
impregnable
because
of
the
narrowness
of
the
isthmus
connecting
it
with
the
mainland
placed
where
it
is
just
in
the
rear
of
the
position
which
an
enemy
must
take
who
is
meditating
an
attack
on
lisbon
it
offers
unique
opportunities
for
making
incursions
on
his
rear
and
his
communications
moreover
it
afforded
a
refuge
and
a
safe
point
of
departure
by
sea
for
any
section
of
the
allied
troops
which
might
become
isolated
and
be
pressed
towards
the
water
by
the
advancing
enemy
some
of
wellington
s
officers
considered
that
it
was
an
even
better
place
for
embarkation
than
lisbon
if
the
french
should
prove
too
strong
and
the
british
should
be
compelled
to
abandon
portugal
the
thought
otherwise
but
caused
its
fortification
to
be
carefully
restored
and
garrisoned
it
with
a
picked
regiment
of
militia
d
urban
says
in
his
diary
inspected
peniche
the
isthmus
over
which
the
peninsula
is
approached
is
covered
with
water
at
high
tide
and
from
the
line
of
works
describing
a
sort
of
arc
very
powerful
may
be
established
upon
every
part
of
it
there
are
nearly
good
guns
upon
the
work
the
brass
ones
especially
good
this
is
the
most
favourable
position
that
can
he
conceived
for
embarking
the
british
army
should
it
ever
be
necessary
to
do
so
the
circumference
abounds
with
creeks
and
clefts
in
the
rocks
inside
which
there
is
always
smooth
water
and
easy
egress
for
boats
they
are
out
of
the
reach
of
fire
from
the
mainland
indeed
there
is
sufficient
room
to
encamp
a
large
force
perfectly
beyond
the
range
of
the
enemy
if
it
should
be
thought
worth
while
this
peninsula
could
be
held
by
england
even
if
portugal
otherwise
were
in
the
power
of
the
enemy
there
is
abundance
of
water
if
it
be
the
wish
of
lord
wellington
he
can
retire
upon
lisbon
give
battle
in
front
of
it
and
if
the
day
go
against
him
retreat
upon
peniche
and
defend
it
so
long
as
he
even
more
important
than
peniche
was
abrantes
the
one
great
of
the
tagus
above
lisbon
where
there
was
a
permanent
bridge
and
free
communication
by
good
roads
between
beira
and
alemtejo
it
lies
at
the
point
where
the
road
from
spain
by
way
of
castello
branco
crosses
the
road
from
north
to
south
down
the
portuguese
frontier
from
almeida
and
guarda
to
evora
and
elvas
an
invader
who
has
advanced
towards
lisbon
through
beira
has
it
on
his
flank
and
rear
equally
so
an
invader
who
has
advanced
on
the
same
objective
from
badajoz
and
the
guadiana
it
is
the
natural
point
at
which
to
move
troops
north
and
south
along
the
frontier
though
wellington
had
established
an
alternative
temporary
at
villa
velha
thirty
miles
higher
up
the
river
by
means
of
pontoons
but
this
secondary
passage
was
inferior
in
safety
since
it
was
not
protected
by
a
fortress
like
abrantes
orders
were
given
to
burn
the
pontoons
if
ever
a
french
force
from
the
east
should
came
near
at
abrantes
on
the
other
hand
the
could
be
pulled
up
and
stacked
under
the
city
walls
in
the
event
of
an
attack
and
did
not
need
to
be
destroyed
the
town
is
situated
on
a
lofty
eminence
upon
the
north
bank
of
the
tagus
its
fortifications
were
antiquated
in
but
had
been
for
many
months
in
process
of
being
rebuilt
and
strengthened
by
the
english
engineer
patton
with
new
earthworks
and
redoubts
it
had
been
made
a
strong
place
which
could
not
be
taken
without
a
regular
siege
and
plenty
of
heavy
artillery
here
wellington
had
placed
a
garrison
of
two
militia
regiments
under
the
portuguese
general
lobo
whose
orders
were
to
resist
to
the
last
and
to
make
sure
of
burning
the
down
to
the
last
plank
before
surrendering
the
french
never
put
him
to
the
test
since
they
had
no
heavy
guns
with
them
and
therefore
regarded
it
as
hopeless
to
attempt
an
attack
on
the
place
d
urban
has
a
long
disquisition
on
abrantes
in
his
diary
its
weak
points
he
says
were
an
outlying
hill
on
the
punhete
road
which
gave
a
favourable
position
for
hostile
batteries
and
the
friable
nature
of
the
gravelly
soil
which
did
not
bind
well
in
trenches
and
outworks
almeida
and
elvas
peniche
and
abrantes
were
regular
fortresses
with
large
garrisons
there
were
however
other
points
where
wellington
ordered
fortifications
of
a
less
permanent
kind
to
be
thrown
up
because
he
thought
them
of
strategical
importance
the
two
most
important
were
one
on
the
northern
line
of
advance
which
the
french
might
take
the
other
on
the
central
or
castello
branco
line
the
first
was
a
line
of
redoubts
behind
the
river
alva
just
where
it
joins
the
mondego
on
either
side
of
the
bridge
and
village
of
ponte
de
murcella
it
was
here
he
thought
that
masséna
would
choose
his
road
along
the
south
bank
of
the
mondego
if
he
marched
on
lisbon
by
the
beira
line
but
the
marshal
moved
by
vizeu
partly
as
it
seems
because
he
had
heard
of
the
fortifications
of
this
defile
and
the
works
were
never
used
equally
unprofitable
so
it
chanced
was
another
important
series
of
constructed
to
cover
the
lowest
reach
of
the
zezere
against
an
invader
who
should
come
by
the
castello
branco
road
and
should
have
masked
or
taken
abrantes
this
was
a
line
of
redoubts
and
trenches
almost
a
fortified
camp
on
the
east
bank
of
the
river
from
tancos
to
opposite
martinchel
blocking
both
the
roads
which
lead
from
castello
branco
into
estremadura
masséna
coming
not
by
the
route
which
was
guarded
against
but
from
leiria
and
thomar
took
the
lines
of
zezere
in
the
rear
and
they
proved
useless
along
with
the
precautions
taken
on
the
banks
of
the
alva
and
the
zezere
two
other
pieces
of
engineering
must
be
mentioned
the
one
the
destruction
of
the
the
which
leads
from
fundão
and
belmonte
to
the
lower
zezere
without
passing
through
castello
branco
has
already
been
noticed
when
we
were
dealing
with
the
possible
lines
of
invasion
in
portugal
the
other
move
was
constructive
not
destructive
in
character
foreseeing
that
abrantes
might
be
masked
or
besieged
on
the
northern
bank
of
the
tagus
and
all
the
roads
in
that
direction
thereby
blocked
while
it
might
still
be
very
profitable
to
have
free
communication
between
lisbon
and
the
castello
branco
region
he
caused
the
road
above
the
south
bank
of
the
tagus
from
opposite
abrantes
to
the
at
villa
velha
to
be
thoroughly
reconstructed
this
route
by
gavião
and
niza
was
so
much
easier
in
its
slopes
than
the
old
branco
that
even
when
the
latter
was
safe
troops
moving
from
east
to
west
along
the
tagus
often
used
it
during
the
next
two
years
of
the
war
though
it
involved
two
passages
of
the
river
instead
of
one
but
all
the
matters
of
engineering
hitherto
mentioned
were
unimportant
and
merely
subsidiary
when
placed
beside
the
one
great
piece
of
work
which
formed
the
keystone
of
wellington
s
plan
for
the
defence
of
portugal
his
whole
scheme
depended
on
the
existence
of
an
impregnable
place
of
refuge
available
both
for
his
army
and
for
the
emigrant
population
of
the
which
he
was
about
to
devastate
he
must
have
a
line
on
which
the
invader
could
be
finally
checked
and
forced
to
halt
and
starve
if
such
a
line
had
not
existed
his
whole
scheme
would
have
been
impracticable
and
after
a
lost
battle
he
might
have
been
driven
to
that
hurried
embarkation
which
the
ministers
in
london
foresaw
and
dreaded
but
his
eye
had
been
fixed
upon
the
ground
in
front
of
lisbon
ever
since
his
second
landing
in
the
peninsula
in
april
and
there
he
thought
that
the
necessary
stronghold
might
be
found
a
full
year
before
masséna
s
invasion
he
had
informed
the
british
cabinet
that
though
he
could
not
undertake
to
defend
all
portugal
for
the
whole
country
is
frontier
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
entering
by
some
point
or
other
he
yet
conceived
that
he
might
protect
the
essential
part
of
the
realm
the
capital
against
anything
save
the
most
overwhelming
odds
the
scheme
had
taken
definite
shape
in
his
head
when
on
october
he
wrote
his
famous
dispatch
to
colonel
fletcher
the
commanding
engineer
at
lisbon
directing
him
to
draw
up
without
delay
a
scheme
for
the
construction
of
two
successive
lines
of
trenches
and
redoubts
covering
the
whole
stretch
of
country
from
the
atlantic
to
a
point
on
the
estuary
of
the
tagus
twenty
miles
or
more
north
of
the
capital
this
was
in
its
essentials
the
order
for
the
construction
of
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
for
though
the
front
designated
does
not
exactly
tally
with
that
ultimately
taken
up
it
only
differs
from
it
in
points
of
detail
fletcher
is
directed
to
survey
a
line
from
the
mouth
of
the
castanheira
brook
to
the
mouth
of
the
zizandre
and
another
a
few
miles
behind
from
alhandra
on
the
tagus
by
bucellas
and
cabeça
de
montechique
towards
mafra
these
roughly
represent
the
two
lines
of
defence
ultimately
constructed
though
in
the
end
the
extreme
right
flank
was
drawn
back
from
the
castanheira
to
the
alhandra
stream
fletcher
is
told
that
the
works
will
be
on
the
largest
scale
the
fortified
camp
above
torres
vedras
is
to
hold
men
the
works
at
cabeça
de
montechique
alone
will
require
workmen
to
be
set
to
dig
at
once
great
operations
such
as
the
damming
up
of
rivers
and
the
creation
of
marshes
many
miles
long
are
suggested
for
these
views
of
and
see
vol
ii
how
the
great
scheme
worked
out
and
how
the
works
stood
when
masséna
s
army
at
last
appeared
in
front
of
them
will
be
told
in
a
later
chapter
in
its
due
place
suffice
it
here
to
say
that
all
through
the
spring
and
summer
of
they
were
being
urged
forward
with
feverish
haste
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
it
was
an
easy
matter
to
carry
out
all
these
preparations
the
portuguese
government
ended
by
adopting
all
wellington
s
suggestions
but
it
was
not
without
friction
that
he
achieved
his
purpose
while
he
was
planning
works
at
the
very
gates
of
lisbon
and
making
provisions
for
the
devastation
of
whole
provinces
in
view
of
the
approaching
invasion
he
was
often
met
by
suggestions
that
it
would
be
possible
to
defend
the
outer
frontiers
of
the
realm
and
that
his
schemes
were
calculated
to
dishearten
the
portuguese
people
rather
than
to
encourage
them
to
a
firm
resistance
the
regency
moreover
had
enough
national
pride
to
resent
the
way
in
which
a
policy
was
dictated
to
them
without
any
reference
to
their
own
views
the
governing
party
in
portugal
had
accepted
the
english
alliance
without
reserve
but
it
often
winced
at
the
consequences
of
its
action
there
was
a
view
abroad
that
the
little
nation
was
being
set
in
the
forefront
of
the
battle
of
european
independence
mainly
for
the
benefit
of
great
britain
fortunately
the
memory
of
junot
s
dictatorship
and
soult
s
ravages
was
still
fresh
enough
to
overcome
all
other
considerations
a
moment
s
reflection
convinced
wellington
s
most
ardent
critics
that
though
the
british
yoke
might
sometimes
seem
hard
anything
was
better
than
a
return
to
french
servitude
the
regency
murmured
but
always
ended
by
yielding
and
issued
the
edicts
necessary
to
confirm
all
the
orders
of
the
general
the
state
of
the
portuguese
government
at
this
moment
requires
a
word
of
explanation
the
original
regency
confirmed
by
sir
hew
dalrymple
in
had
been
somewhat
changed
in
its
personnel
it
was
now
a
more
numerous
body
than
at
its
first
installation
of
the
original
members
only
the
patriarch
antonio
de
castro
late
bishop
of
oporto
and
the
marquez
de
olhão
francisco
de
mello
e
menezes
the
constable
or
monteiro
mor
as
he
is
more
frequently
called
now
survived
but
four
new
members
had
been
appointed
in
the
most
important
of
them
was
josé
antonio
de
menezes
e
sousa
generally
known
as
the
principal
sousa
an
ecclesiastic
who
was
one
of
the
band
of
three
sousa
brothers
who
formed
the
backbone
of
the
party
in
portugal
the
eldest
of
them
rodrigo
de
sousa
coutinho
conde
de
linhares
was
prime
minister
of
the
prince
regent
at
rio
de
janeiro
the
third
domingos
antonio
de
sousa
coutinho
afterwards
conde
de
funchal
was
portuguese
minister
in
london
thus
when
the
principal
entered
the
regency
this
busy
and
capable
family
could
pull
the
strings
alike
at
rio
london
and
lisbon
in
the
interests
of
their
relations
and
dependants
this
they
did
without
scruple
and
without
ceasing
domestic
politics
in
portugal
had
always
been
a
matter
of
family
alliances
as
much
as
of
principles
they
presented
indeed
a
considerable
resemblance
to
those
of
great
britain
during
the
whig
domination
of
the
eighteenth
century
hence
there
was
considerable
danger
that
the
policy
of
the
alliance
against
napoleon
might
become
identified
in
the
eyes
of
the
portuguese
nation
with
the
domination
of
the
sousa
faction
that
this
peril
was
avoided
was
not
their
fault
they
did
their
best
to
keep
all
promotion
civil
and
military
for
their
own
adherents
hence
came
interminable
quarrels
on
petty
personal
questions
both
with
wellington
and
beresford
fortunately
the
two
marshals
could
generally
get
their
way
in
the
end
when
large
interests
were
at
stake
because
the
sousas
were
pledged
to
the
british
alliance
and
dared
not
break
with
it
to
do
so
would
have
brought
other
politicians
to
the
front
but
meanwhile
unending
controversies
wasted
wellington
s
time
and
soured
his
temper
more
than
once
he
is
found
writing
in
his
dispatches
to
lord
liverpool
that
the
impatient
meddling
mischievous
principal
ought
to
be
got
out
of
the
regency
and
promoted
to
some
foreign
embassy
or
great
civil
post
where
he
could
do
less
harm
but
the
british
government
thought
and
probably
was
right
in
thinking
that
it
was
better
to
bear
with
known
evils
than
to
quarrel
with
the
sousa
family
and
thereby
to
break
up
the
party
in
portugal
wellington
had
to
endure
the
principal
s
small
intrigues
and
petty
criticism
till
the
end
wellington
to
lord
liverpool
vi
the
other
members
who
entered
the
regency
in
were
the
conde
de
redondo
fernando
maria
de
sousa
coutinho
another
of
the
sousa
clan
doctor
raymundo
nogueira
a
law
professor
of
the
university
of
coimbra
and
far
the
most
important
of
all
the
newly
appointed
british
minister
at
lisbon
charles
stuart
the
nomination
of
a
foreigner
to
such
a
post
touched
portuguese
pride
to
the
quick
and
was
looked
upon
by
all
enemies
of
the
sousa
faction
as
an
act
of
miserable
weakness
on
the
part
of
the
conde
de
linhares
and
the
prince
regent
it
was
considered
doubtful
policy
on
the
part
of
the
perceval
cabinet
to
consent
to
the
appointment
considering
the
offence
which
it
was
certain
to
give
in
their
justification
it
must
be
pleaded
that
both
the
patriarch
and
the
principal
sousa
were
men
capable
of
causing
any
amount
of
difficulty
by
their
plans
and
their
personal
intrigues
and
that
a
colleague
who
could
be
trusted
to
keep
an
eye
upon
their
actions
and
to
moderate
their
ambitions
was
much
needed
stuart
was
a
man
of
moderate
and
tactful
bearing
but
could
be
neither
cajoled
nor
overruled
it
was
on
his
influence
in
the
regency
that
wellington
relied
most
for
support
at
this
moment
there
were
two
questions
in
process
of
discussion
which
rendered
it
most
necessary
that
the
portuguese
government
should
not
be
left
entirely
to
its
own
guidance
taking
advantage
of
the
unhappy
condition
of
spain
and
the
weakness
of
the
newly
appointed
executive
at
cadiz
the
portuguese
were
pressing
for
the
restoration
of
olivenza
godoy
s
old
conquest
of
and
for
the
recognition
of
the
princess
carlotta
of
spain
the
wife
of
the
prince
of
the
brazils
as
the
person
entitled
to
act
as
regent
of
spain
during
the
captivity
of
her
brothers
at
valençay
dom
pedro
de
sousa
holstein
the
portuguese
minister
at
cadiz
a
kinsman
of
linhares
and
the
principal
was
actively
urging
both
these
demands
on
the
spanish
government
if
he
had
succeeded
in
imposing
them
on
castaños
and
his
colleagues
there
would
have
been
desperate
friction
between
the
allies
but
by
promising
the
active
support
of
the
portuguese
army
within
the
spanish
frontiers
which
he
had
no
power
to
guarantee
and
which
wellington
had
absolutely
refused
to
grant
the
minister
won
some
support
at
cadiz
extra
pressure
was
brought
to
bear
upon
the
spaniards
by
the
massing
of
brazilian
troops
on
the
south
american
frontier
on
the
side
of
rio
grande
do
sul
a
most
unjustifiable
act
which
might
have
led
to
an
actual
rupture
a
thing
which
the
british
government
was
bound
to
prevent
by
every
means
in
its
power
the
only
way
to
prevent
an
open
breach
between
spain
and
portugal
was
to
check
the
activity
of
sousa
holstein
an
end
which
stuart
found
much
difficulty
in
accomplishing
because
the
objects
for
which
the
minister
was
striving
and
especially
the
restoration
of
olivenza
to
its
old
owners
were
entirely
approved
by
his
colleagues
in
the
regency
when
it
is
added
that
there
were
numerous
other
points
of
friction
between
the
british
and
the
portuguese
governments
such
as
the
question
of
free
trade
with
brazil
that
of
the
suppression
of
the
slave
trade
and
that
of
the
form
to
be
adopted
for
the
payment
of
the
subsidies
which
maintained
the
portuguese
army
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
stuart
s
position
on
the
council
of
regency
was
no
easy
one
he
often
found
himself
in
a
minority
of
one
when
a
discussion
started
he
frequently
had
to
acquiesce
in
decisions
which
he
did
not
approve
merely
in
order
to
avoid
friction
on
matters
of
secondary
importance
but
in
matters
of
really
primary
moment
he
generally
succeeded
in
getting
his
way
owing
to
the
simple
fact
that
portugal
was
dependent
on
great
britain
for
the
continuance
of
her
national
existence
conscious
of
this
the
other
members
of
the
regency
would
generally
yield
a
reluctant
assent
at
the
last
moment
and
wellington
s
plans
when
set
forth
by
stuart
though
often
criticized
delayed
and
impeded
were
in
the
end
carried
out
with
more
or
less
completeness
a
man
of
whom
all
portuguese
writers
speak
with
respect
even
napier
notes
him
ii
as
a
man
of
talent
and
but
wellington
seems
to
have
disliked
him
the
admission
of
raymundo
nogueira
to
the
regency
and
the
reasons
of
his
admission
were
truly
ludicrous
his
appointment
is
to
be
agreeable
to
the
lower
orders
from
among
whom
he
is
selected

the
french
preparations
masséna
s
army
of
portugal
during
the
summer
campaign
of
the
french
army
of
spain
had
received
hardly
any
reinforcements
from
beyond
the
pyrenees
every
man
that
the
emperor
could
arm
was
being
directed
against
austria
in
may
and
june
but
when
wagram
had
been
won
and
the
armistice
of
znaym
signed
and
when
moreover
it
had
been
discovered
that
the
british
expedition
to
the
isle
of
walcheren
need
not
draw
off
any
part
of
the
army
of
germany
the
emperor
began
to
turn
his
attention
to
the
peninsula
the
armistice
with
austria
had
been
signed
on
july
only
six
days
later
on
the
of
the
same
month
napoleon
was
already
selecting
troops
to
send
to
spain
and
expressing
his
intention
of
going
there
himself
to
finish
the
business
in
person
but
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
it
was
too
late
in
the
year
for
him
to
transport
any
great
mass
of
men
to
the
peninsula
in
time
for
operations
in
the
autumn
and
had
settled
that
the
expulsion
of
the
english
and
the
conquest
of
cadiz
seville
and
valencia
must
be
delayed
to
the
spring

decision
that
soult
should
not
be
allowed
to
make
any

on

in

autumn
and
a
month
later
he
advised
his
brother
to
defend
the
line
of
the
tagus
and
drive
back
spanish
incursions
but
to
defer
all
offensive
movements

memoranda
for

joseph
the
composition
of
the
new
army
that
was
to
enter
spain
was
dictated
in
a
minute
to
the
minister
of
war
on
october
in
which
the
emperor
stated
that
the
total
force
was
to
be
about
men
including
the
guard
that
it
was
all
to
be
on
the
roads
between
orleans
and
bayonne
by
december
and
that
he
should
take
command
in
person
it
may
be
noted
that
the
troops
designated
in
this
memorandum
were
actually
those
which
took
part
in
the
campaign
of
with
the
exception
of
the
old
guard
which
was
held
back
when
napoleon
determined
to
remain
behind
and
to
send
a
substitute
as
in
spain
since
the
bulk
of
the
immense
column
was
only
directed
to
reach
bayonne
at
the
end
of
the
year
it
was
clear
that
it
would
not
be
within
striking
distance
of
the
enemy
till
march
same
to
same
down
to
the
month
of
december
napoleon
s
correspondence
teems
with
allusions
to
his
approaching
departure
for
spain
they
were
not
merely
intended
to
deceive
the
public
for
they
occur
in
letters
to
his
most
trusted
ministers
and
generals
we
might
be
inclined
to
suspect
an
intention
to
cajole
the
english
ministry
in
the
magnificent
phrases
of
the
address
to
the
corps
législatif
on
december
when
the
emperor
declares
that
the
moment
he
displays
himself
beyond
the
pyrenees
the
leopard
in
terror
will
seek
the
ocean
to
avoid
shame
defeat
and
but
business
was
certainly
meant
when
berthier
was
advised
to
send
forward
his
carriages
and
horses
to
madrid
and
when
the
old
guard
s
departure
for
the
frontier
was
ordered
suddenly
in
the
third
week
of
december
the
allusions
to
the
emperor
s
impending
departure
cease
it
would
appear
that
his
change
of
purpose
must
be
attributed
not
to
the
news
of
ocaña
where
the
last
great
spanish
army
had
perished
but
to
a
purely
domestic
cause
this
was
the
moment
at
which
the
question
of
the
imperial
divorce
came
into
prominence
it
would
seem
that
when
napoleon
had
conceived
the
idea
of
the
austrian
marriage
and
had
learnt
that
his
offers
were
likely
to
be
accepted
he
gave
up
all
intention
of
invading
spain
in
the
early
spring
in
person
the
divorce
was
first
officially
mooted
when
the
protest
was
laid
before
a
privy
council
on
december
and
after
that
day
there
is
no
more
mention
of
a
departure
for
the
south
all
through
january
february
and
march
the
negotiations
were
in
progress
and
on
april
the
emperor
married
his
new
wife
the
festivities
which
followed
lasted
many
days
and
when
they
were
over
the
emperor
conducted
his
spouse
on
a
long
tour
through
the
northern
departments
in
may
and
did
not
return
to
the
vicinity
of
paris
till
june
when
the
army
of
invasion
which
had
long
since
reached
the
peninsula
had
been
already
handed
over
to
a
new
chief
napoleon

for
the
privy

dated
in
the
the

ceremony
took

first

on
the
second
of
these
two
days
in
the
months
during
which
the
marriage
negotiations
were
in
progress
and
the
columns
of
reinforcements
were
pouring
into
navarre
and
old
castile
it
is
not
quite
certain
what
were
the
emperor
s
real
intentions
as
to
the
allocation
of
the
command
nothing
clear
can
be
deduced
from
an
order
given
to
junot
in
the
middle
of
february
to
spread
everywhere
the
news
of
the
arrival
of
the
emperor
with
men
in
order
to
disquiet
the
english
and
prevent
them
from
undertaking
operations
in
the
south
this
is
but
a
de
the
marriage
project
was
so
far
advanced
that
the
ratifications
of
the
contract
were
signed
only
four
days
later
than
the
date
of
the
dispatch
and
napoleon
must
have
known
that
he
could
not
get
away
from
paris
for
another
two
months
at
the
least
but
it
was
only
on
april
that
an
imperial
decree
dated
at
compiègne
was
published
announcing
that
not
the
whole
french
force
in
spain
but
three
army
corps
the
and
with
certain
other
troops
were
to
form
the
army
of
portugal
and
to
be
placed
under
the
command
of
masséna
duke
of
rivoli
and
prince
of
essling
after
this
it
was
certain
that
the
emperor
would
not
cross
the
pyrenees
five
days
later
this
was
made
still
more
clear
by
an
order
to
the
commandant
of
the
guard
to
recall
the
old
chasseur
and
grenadier
regiments
of
that
corps
from
the
various
points
that
they
had
reached
on
the
way
to
bayonne
and
to
send
on
to
spain
only
the
tirailleur
and
voltigeur
regiments
recently
raised
in
and
generally
known
as
the
young
guard
napoleon
never
took
the
field
in
person
without
the
veteran
portion
of
his
napoleon
to
berthier
paris
on
see
napoleon
to
king
joseph
paris
napoleon
to
clarke
april
not
in
the
but
given
at
length
by
ducasse
in
his
of
king
vii
the
of
the
emperor
had
one
most
important
result
if
he
had
taken
the
field
every
marshal
and
general
in
spain
would
have
been
subject
to
a
single
directing
will
and
would
have
been
forced
to
combine
his
operations
with
those
of
his
neighbours
whether
he
wished
or
no
on
determining
to
devote
the
spring
and
summer
of
to
nuptial
feasts
and
state
progresses
instead
of
to
a
campaign
on
the
tagus
he
did
not
nominate
any
single
to
take
his
place
masséna
from
his
seniority
and
his
splendid
military
record
might
have
seemed
worthy
of
such
promotion
he
was
not
given
it
but
only
placed
in
charge
of
three
army
corps
and
of
certain
parts
of
old
castile
and
leon
and
the
garrison
troops
there
residing
this
was
a
vast
charge
embracing
in
all
the
command
of
men
but
it
gave
masséna
no
control
over
the
rest
of
the
armies
of
spain
and
no
power
to
secure
their
save
by
the
tedious
method
of
appeals
to
paris
indeed
the
emperor
had
chosen
the
precise
moment
of
king
joseph
s
conquest
of
andalusia
to
break
up
such
hierarchical
organization
of
command
as
existed
in
the
peninsula
by
a
decree
of
february
he
took
the
provinces
of
aragon
and
catalonia
with
the
army
corps
there
employed
completely
out
of
the
sphere
of
the
authority
of
king
joseph
augereau
and
suchet
were
forbidden
to
hold
any
communication
with
madrid
and
were
directed
to
make
every
report
and
request
to
paris
this
would
not
have
been
fatal
to
the
success
of
the
main
operations
of
the
french
army
for
aragon
and
catalonia
were
a
whose
military
history
all
through
the
war
had
little
connexion
with
that
of
castile
and
portugal
but
their
severance
from
the
military
hierarchy
dependent
on
the
king
was
followed
by
that
of
navarre
the
basque
provinces
burgos
valladolid
palencia
and
toro
which
were
formed
into
four
military
governments
under
generals
dufour
thouvenot
dorsenne
and
kellermann
these
governors
were
given
complete
civil
and
military
autonomy
with
power
to
raise
taxes
administer
justice
to
name
and
displace
spanish
functionaries
and
to
move
their
troops
at
their
own
pleasure
under
responsibility
to
the
emperor
alone
the
government
valladolid
palencia
toro
was
afterwards
placed
under
the
authority
of
masséna
the
others
remained
independent
viceroyalties
thus
military
authority
in
the
peninsula
was
divided
up
for
the
future
between
the
commander
of
the
army
of
portugal
who
controlled
not
only
his
army
but
all
the
regions
which
it
occupied
leon
the
greater
part
of
old
castile
and
part
of
estremadura
the
military
governors
of
catalonia
aragon
navarre
biscay
burgos
the
king
who
practically
controlled
his
army
of
the
centre
and
the
kingdom
of
new
castile
alone
since
soult
in
andalusia
though
not
formally
created
a
military
governor
practically
acted
on
his
own
responsibility
without
any
reference
to
the
king
s
wishes
all
the
viceroys
reported
directly
to
paris
and
kept
the
emperor
fully
employed
with
their
perpetual
bickerings
how
napoleon
came
to
create
and
continue
such
a
vicious
system
it
is
hard
to
conceive
apparently
the
explanation
must
be
sought
in
the
fact
that
he
feared
servants
with
too
great
power
and
acted
on
the
principle
of
et
despite
of
the
fact
that
he
knew
as
a
soldier
that
the
want
of
a
is
ruinous
in
practical
war
at
the
bottom
was
the
idea
that
he
himself
could
manage
everything
even
when
his
armies
were
a
thousand
miles
away
and
when
it
took
three
weeks
or
a
month
to
transmit
orders
to
them
he
sometimes
acknowledged
in
a
moment
of
that
this
was
a
bad
arrangement
and
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
conduct
or
criticize
the
details
of
strategy
at
such
a
distance
or
under
such
conditions
but
after
a
lucid
moment
he
would
fall
back
into
his
usual
ways
of
thought
and
proceed
to
give
orders
and
directions
which
were
obsolete
before
the
dispatches
that
conveyed
them
could
be
delivered
to
the
hands
of
his
marshals
to
proceed
to
details
the
old
army
of
spain
had
come
to
a
standstill
after
it
had
overrun
andalusia
in
february
three
corps
under
soult
were
absorbed
by
that
new
conquest
some
men
in
all
suchet
with
his
corps
men
held
aragon
augereau
with
the
vast
corps
in
all
did
not
hold
down
but
was
executing
military
promenades
in
the
turbulent
catalonia
the
and
corps
lay
observing
portugal
the
former
with
head
quarters
at
talavera
the
latter
with
head
quarters
at
salamanca
ney
had
now
returned
to
take
charge
of
the
corps
and
reynier
an
old
enemy
of
the
english
who
had
beaten
him
at
alexandria
and
maida
was
named
chief
of
the
corps
this
last
had
now
been
shorn
of
its
third
division
that
which
had
been
composed
of
so
many
fractional
units
in
these
had
been
made
over
to
the
corps
which
in
possessed
three
divisions
and
no
longer
two
reynier
had
about
men
ney
no
less
than
after
this
rearrangement
he
had
been
assigned
lorges
as
well
as
the
troops
transferred
from
the
corps
the
king
had
men
in
madrid
and
new
castile
the
old
garrisons
of
the
northern
provinces
excluding
the
newly
arrived
reinforcements
made
up
nearly
men
more
this
sabres
and
bayonets
represents
the
old
army
of
the
troops
sent
down
by
the
emperor
after
the
termination
of
the
austrian
war
had
not
for
the
most
part
been
absorbed
into
the
old
units
though
they
had
crossed
the
pyrenees
in
december
and
january
note
that
the
corps
had
left
behind
in
madrid
men
of
its
division
the
léger
and
line
and
taken
on
instead
men
of
the
division
dessolles
properly
forming
part
of
the
army
of
the
loison
s
division
of
the
corps
received
these
stray
battalions
which
were
united
to
those
of
the
same
regiments
which
had
crossed
the
pyrenees
with
him
they
consisted
of
a
battalion
each
of
the
du
of
the
the
of
the
line
and
the
léger
all
these
figures
are
of
men
sick
and
detached
the
former
about
the
latter
it
is
now
time
to
see
what
troops
constituted
these
succours
the
men
with
whom
the
emperor
had
originally
intended
to
march
in
person
to
the
conquest
of
the
peninsula
on
looking
through
their
muster
roll
the
first
thing
that
strikes
the
eye
is
that
very
little
almost
nothing
indeed
had
been
taken
from
the
army
of
germany
the
emperor
though
austria
was
tamed
and
prussia
was
under
his
feet
did
not
think
it
safe
to
cut
down
to
any
great
extent
the
garrisons
of
central
europe
and
eastern
france
of
all
the
corps
that
had
taken
part
in
the
wagram
campaign
only
one
had
been
directed
on
spain
and
this
was
a
force
of
the
second
line
a
unit
originally
called
the
corps
de
réserve
de
l
armée
d
allemagne
and
afterwards
the
corps
it
had
played
only
a
small
part
in
the
late
war
and
was
mostly
composed
of
the
newly
raised
battalions
of
regiments
serving
elsewhere
recruited
up
to
a
strength
of
men
by
the
addition
of
some
stray
battalions
from
northern
germany
it
was
the
first
of
all
the
new
reinforcements
to
reach
spain
indeed
the
head
of
its
column
reached
burgos
by
the
of
january
it
was
assigned
to
the
army
of
portugal
by
the
drafting
away
of
some
of
its
battalions
to
join
the
regiments
to
which
they
appertained
it
ultimately
came
down
to
about
men
junot
s
original
corps
was
reinforced
by
the
of
the
line
batts
drawn
from
the
prussian
fortresses
and
by
some
units
which
had
hitherto
been
doing
garrison
duty
in
navarrese
and
biscayan
fortresses
where
they
were
now
replaced
by
the
young
guard
among
these
were
the
irish
brigade
batts
and
the
prussian
regiment
which
had
formed
the
original
garrison
of
pampeluna
next
in
point
of
importance
were
the
two
divisions
of
the
young
guard
under
generals
roguet
and
dumoustier
nineteen
battalions
with
three
provisional
regiments
of
the
guard
cavalry
nearly
men
in
all
these
units
had
been
formed
in
just
in
time
for
some
of
them
to
take
their
share
in
the
bloody
days
of
essling
and
wagram
the
emperor
did
not
make
them
over
to
the
army
of
portugal
but
retained
them
in
biscay
and
navarre
close
under
the
pyrenees
apparently
he
disliked
sending
any
of
his
guards
so
far
afield
as
to
render
it
difficult
to
draw
them
back
to
france
in
the
event
unlikely
as
it
was
at
this
moment
of
further
troubles
breaking
out
in
central
europe
the
guard
divisions
stayed
in
spain
two
years
but
were
never
allowed
to
go
far
forward
into
the
interior
deeply
impressed
with
the
danger
and
difficulty
of
keeping
up
the
lines
of
communication
between
bayonne
and
madrid
since
mina
and
his
coadjutors
had
set
the
guerrilla
war
on
foot
in
navarre
and
old
castile
napoleon
had
formed
a
corps
whose
special
duty
was
to
be
the
keeping
open
of
the
roads
and
the
policing
of
the
between
the
frontier
and
the
spanish
capital
this
was
composed
of
twenty
squadrons
of
all
veterans
and
picked
men
each
with
a
total
strength
of
seven
officers
and
troopers
the
decree
ordering
their
selection
from
among
the
of
southern
and
central
france
was
published
on
november
but
the
first
squadrons
only
began
to
pass
the
pyrenees
in
february
and
many
did
not
appear
till
april
and
may
yet
men
were
in
line
by
the
summer
for
details
of
this
corps
and
its
services
see
the
monograph
gendarmerie
en
espagne
et
by
martin
paris
a
few
new
regiments
which
had
not
hitherto
been
represented
in
the
peninsula
were
moved
down
thither
among
these
were
the
neuchâtel
troops
from
berthier
s
principality
a
german
division
from
the
minor
states
of
the
confederation
of
the
rhine
under
general
rouyer
which
went
to
catalonia
the
and
à
with
two
battalions
of
marines
the
total
did
not
amount
to
more
than
some
men
nine
battalions
as
follows
two
of
nassau
the
others
from
gotha
weimar
altenburg
waldeck
reuss
schwarzburg
anhalt
and
lippe
strength
about
men
by
far
the
largest
item
in
the
reinforcements
was
composed
of
the
battalions
of
wellnigh
every
regiment
which
was
already
serving
in
spain
the
army
which
had
marched
across
the
pyrenees
in
had
been
organized
on
the
basis
of
three
to
the
regiment
the
battalion
being
the
dépôt
battalion
but
napoleon
had
now
raised
the
standard
to
four
or
in
a
few
cases
more
over
and
above
the
dépôt
all
the
fourth
battalions
were
now
existing
and
available
a
few
had
served
in
the
austrian
war
many
of
the
others
had
been
lying
in
the
camps
which
the
emperor
had
formed
at
boulogne
pontivy
and
elsewhere
to
protect
his
coasts
against
possible
english
descents
those
belonging
to
regiments
already
in
spain
with
the
full
complement
of
men
each
were
first
ordered
to
cross
the
pyrenees
they
numbered
men
these
were
all
at
the
front
by
may
the
emperor
somewhat
later
dispatched
the
fourth
battalions
of
regiments
more
to
the
peninsula
giving
to
the
temporary
organization
the
name
of
the
corps
this
should
have
given
another
men
and
nearly
did
so
their
gross
total
when
all
had
reached
vittoria
in
september
was
but
the
corps
should
not
be
reckoned
in
the
first
men
which
the
emperor
set
aside
for
the
spring
campaign
of
it
was
a
supplementary
addition
the
battalions
ultimately
retained
in
junot
s
corps
did
not
for
the
most
part
belong
to
regiments
of
the
spanish
army
but
to
regiments
in
germany
or
the
colonies
they
are
over
and
above
the
fourth
battalions
accounted
for
in
the
list
above
for
details
of
the
whole
set
of
reinforcements
see
tables
in
appendix
the
emperor
dealt
in
a
similar
way
with
the
cavalry
the
regiments
already
in
spain
had
been
reduced
to
a
strength
of
two
or
three
squadrons
by
the
wear
and
tear
of
eighteen
months
of
war
the
dépôts
had
now
got
ready
two
squadrons
fit
for
field
service
those
belonging
to
sixteen
regiments
of
dragoons
organized
into
eight
provisional
regiments
were
sent
early
to
the
front
and
were
all
in
spain
by
january
in
addition
to
units
like
battalions
and
and
squadrons
added
to
the
strength
of
each
dragoon
or
infantry
regiment
the
emperor
did
not
neglect
to
send
drafts
to
fill
up
the
depleted
and
battalions
and
and
squadrons
in
the
early
months
of
men
in
small
drafts
not
amounting
to
the
strength
of
a
battalion
or
squadron
were
forwarded
to
recruit
the
old
units
they
went
forward
in
régiments
de
marche
which
were
broken
up
on
reaching
the
head
quarters
of
the
corps
to
which
each
party
belonged
adding
together
all
the
units
with
an
extra
allowance
of
artillery
for
the
new
batteries
that
came
in
with
junot
s
corps
the
guard
divisions
and
the
corps
we
get
as
a
total
of
the
reinforcements
poured
into
spain
between
december
and
september
the
following
figures
junot
s
corps
at
its
final
strength
in
june
infantry
only
young
guard

gendarmerie
new
regiments

the
first

forming
the
corps
cavalry
in
organized
squadrons
artillery
in
complete
batteries
drafts
not
in
permanent
units
for
infantry
cavalry
and
artillery
this
total
far
exceeds
the
original
of
which
napoleon
had
spoken
in
the
autumn
of
but
is
certainly
rather
below
the
actual
number
of
men
received
into
the
peninsula
the
figure
for
drafts
in
especial
is
hard
to
verify
but
as
the
total
strength
of
the
army
of
spain
in
the
autumn
of
was
men
and
in
september
men
while
at
least
had
been
lost
in
the
interval
the
figures
can
not
be
far
out
over
and
above
the
ordinary
for
french
troops
quartered
in
spain
which
was
very
high
we
have
to
allow
for
the
losses
at
tamames
ocaña
the
conquest
of
andalusia
the
sieges
of
astorga
gerona
ciudad
rodrigo
and
almeida
and
all
smaller
engagements
of
this
total
as
we
have
already
said
the
and
corps
and
the
troops
under
kellermann
and
bonnet
occupying
the
provinces
of
toro
palencia
valladolid
and
santander
formed
the
army
of
portugal
assigned
to
masséna
he
was
also
given
an
extra
unattached
division
under
serras
and
promised
the
use
of
the
corps
when
it
should
have
crossed
the
pyrenees
the
gross
total
of
this
force
was
in
may
when
the
new
had
taken
up
his
post
about
men
of
whom
some
were
effective
and
available
for
active
operations
at
the
moment
serras
kellermann
and
bonnet
were
tied
down
to
their
local
duties
the
first
had
to
look
after
the
spanish
army
of
galicia
the
second
to
keep
the
plains
of
valladolid
quiet
the
third
to
hold
santander
and
when
it
was
fully
subdued
to
enter
and
overrun
the
asturias
the
men
of
the
corps
were
not
yet
arrived
in
spain
the
troops
in
the
provinces
of
burgos
biscay
and
navarre
though
not
placed
under
the
marshal
s
actual
command
were
yet
in
existence
to
cover
his
rear
and
his
communications
with
france
if
they
are
added
to
the
total
of
the
force
which
directly
or
indirectly
was
employed
for
the
conquest
of
portugal
some
more
must
be
taken
into
consideration
but
though
they
were
useful
indeed
indispensable
for
the
conquest
of
portugal
it
is
fairer
to
leave
them
out
of
consideration
this
division
had
charge
of
the
provinces
of
leon
zamora
and
salamanca
which
were
not
a
military
roughly
on
may
corps
men
ditto
ditto
cavalry
reserve
effectives
present
under
arms
besides
the
sick
who
made
up
about
more
and
some
men
detached
see
tables
in
appendix
but
the
exact
total
of
an
army
is
after
all
less
important
than
the
character
and
capacity
of
its
generals
the
individuality
of
masséna
was
the
most
important
factor
in
the
problem
of
the
invasion
of
portugal
he
was
years
of
age
very
nearly
the
eldest
of
all
the
marshals
and
he
was
the
only
one
of
those
on
active
service
save
jourdan
who
had
achieved
greatness
in
the
days
before
napoleon
arrived
at
supreme
power
he
had
led
an
army
of
men
when
of
the
three
now
under
him
ney
was
but
a
junot
a
young
captain
and
reynier
a
like
nearly
all
the
men
of
the
revolution
he
had
risen
from
below
he
sprang
from
a
poor
family
in
genoa
according
to
his
enemies
they
were
jews
and
his
name
was
but
manasseh
disguised
his
personal
character
was
detestable
many
of
the
marshals
had
an
evil
reputation
for
financial
probity
but
masséna
s
was
the
worst
of
all
he
plundered
like
a
of
the
middle
ages
wrote
one
of
his
lieutenants
he
had
been
in
trouble
both
with
the
republican
government
and
with
the
emperor
for
his
shameless
malversations
in
italy
and
had
piled
up
a
large
private
fortune
by
surreptitious
methods
avarice
is
not
usually
associated
with
licentiousness
but
he
shocked
even
the
public
opinion
of
the
french
army
by
the
way
in
which
he
paraded
his
mistress
at
unsuitable
moments
and
in
unsuitable
company
he
took
this
person
the
sister
of
one
of
his
with
him
all
through
the
dangers
of
the
portuguese
campaign
where
her
presence
often
caused
friction
and
delays
and
occasionally
exposed
him
to
insults
masséna
was
hard
suspicious
and
revengeful
an
intriguer
to
the
he
was
always
prone
to
suppose
that
others
were
intriguing
against
himself
though
an
old
republican
who
had
risen
from
the
ranks
early
in
the
revolutionary
war
he
had
done
his
best
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
napoleon
by
the
arts
of
the
courtier
altogether
he
was
a
detestable
character
but
he
was
a
great
general
of
all
the
marshals
of
the
empire
he
was
undoubtedly
the
most
capable
davoust
and
soult
with
all
their
abilities
were
not
up
to
his
level
as
a
proof
of
his
boldness
and
rapid
skill
in
seizing
an
opportunity
the
battle
of
zurich
is
sufficient
to
quote
for
his
splendid
obstinacy
the
defence
of
genoa
at
the
commencement
of
his
career
has
its
parallel
in
the
long
endurance
before
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
at
its
end
his
best
testimonial
is
that
wellington
when
asked
long
years
after
which
of
his
old
opponents
was
the
best
soldier
replied
without
hesitation
that
masséna
was
the
man
and
that
he
had
never
permitted
himself
to
take
in
his
presence
the
risks
that
he
habitually
accepted
when
confronted
with
any
of
the
other
marshals
the
emperor
once
confiscated
francs
which
masséna
had
collected
by
selling
licences
to
trade
with
the
english
at
leghorn
and
other

ports

the
fatigues
of
the
late
austrian
war
in
which
he
had
borne
such
an
honourable
part
had
tried
masséna
s
health
it
was
not
without
difficulty
that
the
emperor
had
persuaded
him
to
undertake
the
portuguese
campaign
when
he
first
assembled
round
him
at
salamanca
the
staff
which
was
to
serve
him
in
the
invasion
he
astonished
and
somewhat
disheartened
his
officers
by
beginning
his
greetings
to
them
with
the
remark
gentlemen
i
am
here
contrary
to
my
own
wish
i
begin
to
feel
myself
too
old
and
too
weary
to
go
on
active
service
the
emperor
says
that
i
must
and
replied
to
the
reasons
for
declining
this
post
which
i
gave
him
by
saying
that
my
reputation
would
suffice
to
end
the
war
it
was
very
flattering
no
doubt
but
no
man
has
two
lives
to
live
on
this
earth
the
soldier
least
of
all
those
who
had
served
under
the
marshal
a
few
years
back
and
now
saw
him
after
an
interval
felt
that
there
was
truth
in
what
he
said
foy
wrote
in
his
diary
he
is
no
longer
the
masséna
of
the
flashing
eyes
the
mobile
face
and
the
alert
figure
whom
i
knew
in
and
whose
head
then
recalled
to
me
the
bust
of
marius
he
is
only
but
looks
more
than
sixty
he
has
got
thin
he
is
beginning
to
stoop
his
look
since
the
accident
when
he
lost
his
eye
by
the
emperor
s
hand
has
lost
its
vivacity
the
tone
of
his
voice
alone
remains
but
if
the
marshal
s
bodily
vigour
was
somewhat
abated
his
will
was
as
strong
as
ever
he
needed
it
at
this
juncture
for
he
had
to
command
subordinates
who
were
anything
but
easy
to
deal
with
ney
though
an
honest
man
and
an
admirable
soldier
had
the
fault
of
insubordination
in
the
highest
degree
he
never
obeyed
any
one
save
the
emperor
in
the
true
military
fashion
he
quarrelled
with
every
colleague
that
he
met
notably
with
soult
and
had
an
old
and
very
justifiable
personal
dislike
for
masséna
even
before
the
latter
appeared
at
the
front
he
had
been
heard
to
use
threatening
language
concerning
him
junot
was
almost
as
bad
having
held
the
chief
command
in
the
last
portuguese
expedition
he
had
a
strong
if
a
mistaken
belief
that
it
was
becoming
that
he
should
be
placed
in
charge
of
the
second
his
record
rendered
the
idea
absurd
but
this
he
was
the
last
to
understand
being
of
an
overweening
and
disposition
he
was
stupid
enough
to
regard
masséna
as
his
supplanter
and
to
show
sullen
resentment
of
the
three
chiefs
of
the
army
corps
about
to
invade
portugal
reynier
was
the
only
one
on
decent
terms
with
his
but
even
he
was
not
reckoned
his
friend
this
comes
from
an
with
no
grudge
against
masséna
hulot
commanding
the
artillery
of
the
corps
see
his
foy
the
emperor
a
notoriously
bad
shot
lodged
some
pellets
in
the
marshal
s
left
eye
while
letting
fly
at
a
pheasant
napoleon
turned
round
and
accused
his
faithful
berthier
of
having
fired
the
shot
the
prince
of
neuchâtel
was
courtier
enough
to
take
the
blame
without
a
word
and
in
official
histories
appears
as
the
culprit
see
amic
s
for
other
notes
see
guingret
what
is
most
astonishing
is
that
masséna
was
complaisant
enough
to
affect
to
blame
berthier
for
the
disaster
see
the
admirable
summary
of
all
this
in
foy
s
diary
girod
de
l
ain
marbot
gives
the
same
views
at
bottom
but
with
his
usual
exaggeration
and
with
illustrative
anecdotes
occasionally
of
doubtful
accuracy
masséna
s
chief
of
the
staff
was
fririon
a
scientific
soldier
and
a
man
well
liked
by
his
colleagues
but
it
is
said
that
he
was
not
so
much
in
the
marshal
s
confidence
as
pelet
the
senior
aide
de
camp
of
his
staff
complaints
are
found
in
some
of
the
letters
and
memoirs
of
the
time
that
masséna
would
talk
matters
over
with
pelet
and
issue
orders
without
letting
even
his
chief
of
the
staff
know
of
his
change
of
plan
or
new
inspiration
pelet
s
own
indiscreet
statements
on
this
point
seem
to
justify
the
complaints
made
by
others
against
him
there
was
friction
therefore
even
within
the
staff
itself
and
all
that
the
marshal
did
or
said
was
criticized
by
some
of
those
who
should
have
been
his
loyal
subordinates
under
the
notion
that
it
had
been
inspired
by
others
who
were
accorded
a
more
perfect
confidence
by
their
common
chief
exact
knowledge
of
the
disputes
in
the
is
hard
to
obtain
because
when
the
campaign
was
over
every
man
tried
to
make
out
that
its
failure
had
been
due
to
the
advice
given
to
masséna
by
those
of
whom
he
was
jealous
at
the
bottom
however
all
this
controversy
is
not
very
important
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
marshal
himself
was
responsible
for
all
that
had
happened
he
was
not
the
man
to
be
led
by
the
nose
or
by
ambitious
or
intriguing
underlings

failure
or

is
not

sole
criterion
of
merit
masséna
s
campaign
was
a
disastrous
business
yet
on
investigating
the
disabilities
under
which
he
laboured
we
shall
be
inclined
in
the
end
to
marvel
that
he
did
so
much
not
that
he
did
no
more
the
fundamental
error
was
the
emperor
s
who
gave
him
too
few
men
for
the
enterprise
with
which
he
was
entrusted
napoleon
refused
to
take
the
portuguese
troops
into
consideration
when
he
weighed
the
needs
of
the
expedition
he
repeatedly
wrote
that
it
was
absurd
that
his
armies
should
be
held
in
check
by
or
british
troops
as
if
nothing
else
required
to
be
taken
into
consideration
he
did
not
realize
that
wellington
had
turned
the
portuguese
regular
army
into
a
decent
fighting
machine
capable
of
holding
back
french
divisions
in
line
of
battle
as
was
shown
at
bussaco
he
had
not
foreseen
that
the
despised
militia
required
to
be
contained
by
adequate
numbers
of
troops
on
the
line
of
communications
still
less
had
he
dreamed
of
the
great
scheme
for
the
devastation
of
portugal
which
was
to
be
not
the
least
effective
of
the
weapons
of
its
defender

this

will
be
said

on

and
did
not
appear
at

to
take
up
his
charge
till
may
the
campaign
however
had
begun
long
before
under
the
emperor
s
own
directions
there
were
preliminary
operations
to
be
carried
out
which
could
be
finished
before
either
the
new
or
the
main
body
of
the
reinforcements
from
beyond
the
pyrenees
had
arrived
these
were
the
repression
of
the

establishment
of

that

could

forward
junot

to
positions
from
which
they
should
be

to
strike

moment
that
the
fine
weather
began
with
the
coming
of
the
new
year
when
these
corps
had
reached
their
destined
positions

imperial

to
abound
in
elaborate
directions
for
the
extermination
of
the
guerrillas
of
the
upper
ebro
and
the
upper
douro
orders
which
led
to
much
marching
and
of
the
newly
arrived
troops
but
to
little
practical
effect

the
way

repression
for
skilled
leaders
like

and
julian

nearly
always
slipped
between
the
fingers
of
their
pursuers
and
on
the
few
occasions
when
they
were
pressed
into
a
corner
simply
bade
their
men
disperse
and
unite
again
at
some
distant
rendezvous
these
operations
however
were
wholly

projected
army
of

the
corps
under
the
temporary
command
of
general
heudelet
was
taking
part
in
a
separate
and
remote
series
of
operations
far
to
the
south
this
corps
it
will
be
remembered
had
been
left
on
the
tagus
about
talavera
and
oropesa
to
protect
the
rear
of
soult
and
king
joseph
when
they
marched
in
january
with
the
and
corps
to
conquer
andalusia
that
exploit
having
been
accomplished
mortier
went
with
half
of
the
corps
to
attack
badajoz
and
to
subdue
estremadura
which
soult
imagined
to
be
defenceless
since
albuquerque
had
marched
with
the
old
estremaduran
army
to
save
cadiz
mortier
advanced
unopposed
to
the
walls
of
badajoz
which
he
reached
on
february
but
found
himself
unable
to
undertake
its
siege
with
his
small
force
of
men
because
a
new
spanish
host
had
just
appeared
upon
the
scene
la
romana
with
three
of
the
divisions
of
the
army
that
had
been
beaten
at
alba
de
tormes
in
november
had
marched
down
the
frontier
by
the
pass
of
perales
and
on
the
same
day
that
mortier
appeared
in
front
of
badajoz
his
vanguard
arrived
at
albuquerque
only
twenty
miles
away
these
divisions
were
strong
la
romana
could
add
to
this
force
a
few
thousands
more
left
behind
by
albuquerque
mortier
rightly
felt
that
he
dare
not
commence
the
regular
siege
of
badajoz
when
he
had
such
superior
numbers
in
his
front
he
therefore
asked
for
reinforcements
both
from
soult
and
from
king
joseph
the
former
could
spare
nothing
from
andalusia
at
this
moment
but
the
corps
was
ordered
to
leave
the
tagus
and
place
itself
in
communication
with
mortier
heudelet
had
other
projects
on
hand
at
the
moment
he
had
just
seized
plasencia
on
february
and
was
engaged
in
bickering
with
carlos
d
españa
and
martin
carrera
whom
la
romana
had
left
in
the
sierra
de
gata
but
in
obedience
to
his
orders
he
called
in
his
detachments
and
marched
by
deleytosa
and
truxillo
into
the
valley
of
the
guadiana
this
movement
from
the
french
point
of
view
was
a
hazardous
one
by
the
transference
southward
of
the
corps
a
long
gap
was
left
between
ney
at
salamanca
and
heudelet
and
mortier
in
estremadura
no
troops
whatever
covered
madrid
from
the
side
of
the
and
the
valley
of
the
tagus
and
an
irruption
of
the
english
on
this
line
was
one
of
the
dangers
which
napoleon
most
dreaded
he
was
unaware
of
wellington
s
determination
to
commit
himself
to
no
more
spanish
campaigns
soult
had
given
up
the
corps
when
he
became

wrote
napoleon
on
to
berthier
but
heudelet
had
been
moved
before
his
caution
could
reach
madrid
long
before
heudelet
approached
the
guadiana
mortier
had
been
compelled
partly
by
want
of
supplies
partly
by
the
threatening
attitude
of
la
romana
who
began
cautiously
to
turn
his
flanks
to
retire
from
in
front
of
the
walls
of
badajoz
he
gave
back
as
far
as
zafra
on
the
road
to
the
south
and
six
days
after
marched
for
seville
leaving
only
a
rearguard
at
santa
ollala
on
the
extreme
border
of
estremadura
soult
required
his
presence
for
on
account
of
a
rising
in
granada
and
a
threatening
movement
by
the
spanish
army
of
murcia
the
french
reserves
in
andalusia
had
been
moved
eastward
and
its
capital
was
almost
stripped
of
troops
hence
when
the
corps
reached
caçeres
on
march
and
appeared
in
front
of
albuquerque
on
march
it
found
that
the
corps
had
departed
and
that
it
was
nearly
miles
from
the
nearest
friendly
post
heudelet
therefore
having
all
la
romana
s
army
in
his
front
and
no
orders
to
execute
since
the
junction
with
mortier
had
failed
retired
to
merida
where
reynier
arrived
from
the
north
superseded
him
and
took
command
here
the
corps
remained
practically
passive
for
the
rest
of
the
spring
keeping
open
but
with
difficulty
and
at
long
intervals
the
communications
between
madrid
and

and
almaraz
to
a
certain
extent
reynier
kept
la
romana
s
army
in
check
but
he
did
not
fully
discharge
even
that
moderate
task
for
the
spanish
general
detached
southward
two
of
his
divisions
those
of
contreras
and
ballasteros
to
threaten
the
frontiers
of
andalusia
and
stir
up
an
insurrection
in
the
condado
de
niebla
and
the
other
regions
west
of
seville
ballasteros
surprised
the
cavalry
brigade
of
mortier
s
corps
at
valverde
at
midnight
on
february
and
scattered
it
killing
beauregard
the
brigadier
he
then
advanced
to
ronquillo
only
twenty
miles
from
seville
where
on
march
he
had
an
indecisive
engagement
with
one
of
gazan
s
brigades
after
which
he
retired
into
the
condado
mortier
thereupon
came
out
against
him
from
seville
at
the
head
of
a
whole
division
unwisely
offering
battle
at
zalamea
on
the
rio
tinto
on
april
ballasteros
was
beaten
and
retired
into
the
mountains
thither
after
some
time
he
was
pursued
by
mortier
s
columns
and
again
defeated
at
araçena
on
may
but
he
rallied
his
broken
force
in
the
sierra
de
araçena
where
he
remained
for
long
after
a
thorn
in
the
side
of
the
army
of
andalusia
always
descending
for
a
raid
in
the
plains
of
seville
when
he
was
left
unwatched
soult
was
forced
to
keep
a
considerable
part
of
the
corps
in
observation
of
him
a
detachment
that
he
was
loth
to
spare
la
romana
s
central
divisions
meanwhile
those
of

of

henry

who
had
distinguished
himself
at

in
the
previous
autumn
mendizabal
and
contreras
bickered
with
the
corps
in
the
direction
of
caçeres
and
torresnovas
without
any
notable
advantage
on
either
side
but
as
long
as
reynier
lay
at
merida
and
mortier
might
at
any
moment
come
up
from
seville
to
his
aid
wellington
felt
uneasy
as
to
the
possibility
of
a
french
advance
between
tagus
and
guadiana
and
regarding
la
romana
s
army
as
an
insufficient
security
on
this
side
moved
hill
with
a
force
of
men
to
portalegre
close
to
the
rear
of
badajoz
hill
had
with
his
own
british
division
now
consisting
of
three
brigades
another
division
composed
of
portuguese
under
general
hamilton
the
english
heavy
cavalry
brigade
of
slade
a
weak
portuguese
cavalry
brigade
under
madden
and
three
batteries
he
was
ordered
not
to
countenance
any
offensive
movements
on
the
part
of
la
romana
but
to
support
him
and
to
endeavour
to
cover
badajoz
if
the
french
should
unite
the
and
corps
and
make
a
serious
move
westward
there
was
no
need
as
matters
turned
out
for
any
such
support
for
reynier
though
he
executed
some
rather
useless
feints
and
in
april
and
may
undertook
nothing
serious
one
of
his
demonstrations
drew
hill
to
arronches
close
to
elvas
on
may
but
it
turned
out
to
be
meaningless
and
the
british
troops
returned
to
their
usual
head
quarters
at
portalegre
a
few
days
later
there
seems
to
have
been
some
uncertainty
of
purpose
in
all
this
manœuvring
of
the
french
in
estremadura
reynier
was
not
strong
enough
to
offer
to
fight
la
romana
and
hill
combined
he
might
have
done
so
with
good
prospect
of
success
if
mortier
could
have
been
spared
from
andalusia
but
half
the
corps
was
usually
detached
far
to
the
south
hunting
the
insurgents
of
the
sierra
de
ronda
and
the
other
half
had
to
garrison
seville
and
watch
ballasteros
hence
reynier
left
to
himself
did
no
more
for
the
common
cause
of
the
french
in
spain
than
detain
hill
s
two
divisions
in
the
alemtejo
that
wellington
was
thus
obliged
to
divide
his
army
was
no
doubt
a
permanent
gain
to
the
enemy
yet
they
obtained
it
by
the
very
doubtful
expedient
of
leaving
nothing
on
the
tagus
a
push
in
the
direction
of
plasencia
and
almaraz
by
even
a
small
spanish
force
would
have
been
a
very
tiresome
and
troublesome
matter
for
king
joseph
who
would
have
been
forced
either
to
bring
down
ney
from
salamanca
or
to
call
reynier
back
from
the
guadiana
for
madrid
was
entirely
uncovered
on
the
west
but
nothing
of
the
sort
happened
la
romana
kept
his
main
body
concentrated
in
front
of
badajoz
and
had
the
full
approval
of
wellington
for
doing
so
hill
s

a
much
greater
degree
of

but
equally
indecisive
in
the
end
the
asturias
had
been
almost
stripped
of
troops
by
del
parque
in
order
to
reinforce
the
army
that
fought
at
tamames
and
alba
de
tormes
when
the
duke
moved
his
main
force
southward
after
the
fight
he
carried
off
with
him
the
division
of
ballasteros
which
had
been
the
core
of
the
old
asturian
army
general
antonio
arce
was
left
in
the
principality
with
some
men
whom
he
kept
at
colombres
behind
the
deba
under
general
watching
the
french
force
in
the
province
of
santander
new
levies
little
more
than
strong
were
being
collected
at
oviedo
in
the
end
of
january
general
bonnet
whose
division
at
santander
had
received
its
drafts
and
had
been
strengthened
up
to
men
thought
himself
strong
enough
to
drive
in
arce
s
weak
line
and
to
make
a
dash
at
the
asturian
capital
on
the
he
attacked
the
lines
of
colombres
and
carried
them
with
no
difficulty
on
the
he
captured
oviedo
which
was
evacuated
by
the
arce
and
the
local
junta
without
serious
fighting
but
that
active
partisan
juan
porlier
at
once
cut
off
his
communication
with
santander
by
seizing
infiesto
and
gijon
bonnet
at
once
evacuated
oviedo
and
turned
back
to
clear
his
rear
porlier
escaped
along
the
coast
to
pravia
and
meanwhile
the
main
body
of
the
asturians
under
general
barcena
reoccupied
the
capital
having
driven
off
porlier
the
french
general
marched
westward
once
more
beat
barcena
at
the
bridge
of
colleto
on
february
and
again
made
himself
master
of
oviedo
the
asturians
rallied
behind
the
narcea
where
they
were
joined
by
a
brigade
of
men
sent
to
their
aid
by
mahy
the
of
galicia
he
had
men
with
the
colours
besides
sick
and
detached
by
the
imperial
muster
rolls
of
that
province
like
the
asturias
had
been
left
almost
ungarrisoned
by
del
parque
when
he
took
the
old
army
of
galicia
across
the
sierra
de
gata
and
transferred
it
to
estremadura
mahy
had
been
left
behind
with
the
skeleton
of
one
division
which
he
was
to
recruit
as
best
he
could
by
new
levies
his
main
preoccupation
at
this
moment
was
the
defence
of
the
newly
fortified
stronghold
of
astorga
which
was
already
threatened
by
the
french
troops
in
the
plains
of
leon
but
seeing
his
flank
menaced
by
bonnet
s
advance
he
lent
what
men
he
could
spare
to
aid
in
the
defence
of
the
asturias
the
asturian
junta
having
deposed
general
arce
for
incapacity
and
corruption
and
appointed
cienfuegos
to
take
over
his
troops
ordered
the
resumption
of
offensive
operations
against
bonnet
in
march
porlier
their
great
made
a
circuit
along
the
coast
and
threatened
the
french
communications
with
santander
at
the
same
time
their
main
force
advanced
against
oviedo
by
the
valley
of
the
nalon
bonnet
s
advanced
brigade
was
driven
in
after
a
sharp
skirmish
at
grado
on
march
and
disquieted
by
porlier
s
simultaneous
attack
on
his
rear
he
evacuated
the
asturian
capital
for
the
time
and
gave
back
as
far
as
cangas
de
onis
in
the
valley
of
the
ona
he
then
called
up
all
the
reinforcements
that
he
could
obtain
from
santander
and
marched
for
the
fourth
time
in
three
months
on
oviedo
with
his
whole
division
the
spaniards
retired
without
offering
serious
opposition
and
took
up
a
line
behind
the
narcea
march
this
time
bonnet
left
them
no
time
to
rally
but
forced
the
passage
of
that
river
whereupon
the
asturians
ascended
to
tineo
in
the
mountains
while
the
galician
succours
gave
back
to
navia
almost
on
the
edge
of
their
own
principality
april
after
this
bonnet
s
offensive
force
was
spent
having
to
occupy
oviedo
and
its
ports
of
gijon
and
aviles
as
well
as
all
the
central
and
eastern
asturias
and
moreover
to
defend
his
communication
with
santander
from
new
attacks
of
porlier
his
strength
sufficed
for
no
more
his
men
were
immobilized
for
the
rest
of
the
year
he
had
conquered
of
the
asturias
and
barely
succeeded
in
keeping
it
down
but
he
was
quite
unable
to
spare
a
man
to
aid
in
french
operations
in
the
plains
of
leon
or
even
to
make
a
serious
attempt
to
threaten
galicia
once
or
twice
he
succeeded
in
communicating
with
the
forces
which
junot
and
after
him
kellermann
and
serras
commanded
in
the
plains
beyond
the
cantabrian
range
by
expeditions
pushed
down
through
the
pass
of
pajares
on
to
leon
but
the
road
was
always
closed
again
by
the
guerrillas
and
no
could
take
place
in
short
the
spaniards
lost
the
greater
part
of
the
asturias
and
the
french
lost
the
further
services
of
bonnet
s
division
it
had
no
power
to
threaten
galicia
because
it
was
forced
to
keep
garrisons
in
gijon
aviles
lastres
santona
and
all
the
with
a
full
brigade
at
oviedo
in
the
centre
to
support
them
any
concentration
of
troops
leading
to
the
evacuation
of
the
smaller
garrisons
at
once
let
loose
the
guerrillas
from
their
mountains
bonnet
had
but
men
in
all
of
these
not
more
than
half
could
be
used
for
an
expedition
and
such
a
force
was
too
small
to
have
any
practical
effect
on
the
general
course
of
events
in
spain
i
can
not
understand
napier
s
narrative
of
this
little
campaign
on
pages
of
his
vol
ii
it
runs
as
follows
and
seems
to
have
no
relation
to
the
facts
detailed
by
belmas
toreno
arteche
or
any
other
historian
no
mention
is
made
of
the
four
captures
of
oviedo
mahy
was
organizing
a
second
army
at
lugo
and
in
the
asturias
d
arco
arce
commanded
men
of
whom
were
posted
at
cornellana
under
general
ponte
bonnet
from
the
asturias
threatened
galicia
by
the
concija
d
ibas
having
destroyed
ponte
s
force
at
potes
de
la
sierra
miles
from
colombres
where
the
actual
fight
took
place
he
menaced
galicia
by
the
pass
of
nava
de
suarna
a
place
which
his
vanguard
did
not
approach
by
a
matter
of
miles
but
he
did
not
pass
nava
de
suarna
and
general
d
arco
rallied
the
asturian
fugitives
at
louarca
it
seems
probable
that
while
bonnet
drew
the
attention
of
the
galician
army
towards
lugo
he
was
never
within
miles
of
that
place
junot
thought
to
penetrate
by
puebla
senabria
but
finally
junot
drawing
a
reinforcement
from
bonnet
invested
astorga
with
infantry
no
troops
from
bonnet
s
force
ever
appeared
before
astorga
this
last
blunder
is
apparently
borrowed
from
et
xx
which
states
that
general
bonnet
detached
jeannin
s
brigade
the
and
to
astorga
but
these
regiments
did
not
belong
to
bonnet
but
were
from
the
first
to
the
last
parts
of
junot
s
own
corps
and
never
entered
the
asturias
compare
napoleon
xx
the
muster
rolls
of
and
belmas
iii
bonnet
s
operations
were
of
course
wholly
subsidiary
the
really
important
movements
that
were
on
foot
in
the
early
spring
of
were
those
of
junot
and
ney
in
the
plains
of
leon
in
pursuance
of
the
emperor
s
orders
to
the
effect
that
the
whole
of
leon
was
to
be
occupied
as
a
preliminary
to
the
invasion
of
portugal
loison
who
had
spain
at
the
head
of
a
number
of
battalions
which
were
ultimately
to
join
the
corps
of
ney
was
ordered
to
move
on
from
valladolid
and
occupy
the
country
about
benavente
and
astorga
he
was
left
free
to
select
either
of
those
towns
as
his
head
quarters
and
was
directed
to
communicate
with
bonnet
when
the
latter
should
have
entered
the
asturias
so
that
their
operations
should
threaten
galicia
simultaneously
loison
s
expedition
however
proved
a
complete
failure
he
marched
towards
astorga
early
in
february
with
nearly
men
on
the
he
appeared
before
that
town
and
learnt
that
since
carrié
s
reconnaissance
in
october
it
had
been
much
strengthened
la
romana
had
repaired
the
breaches
of
its
mediaeval
walls
he
had
thrown
up
entrenchments
round
the
suburb
of
la
reteibia
which
occupies
that
part
of
the
hill
of
astorga
which
is
not
covered
by
the
town
itself
he
had
also
established
outlying
posts
in
the
suburbs
of
san
andrés
and
puerta
del
rey
which
lie
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
on
its
northern
and
eastern
sides
fourteen
guns
only
two
of
them
the
rest
light
had
been
mounted
on
the
walls
the
place
therefore
was
a
fortification
of
the
most
antiquated
style
general
garcia
velasco
who
had
been
left
behind
in
galicia
with
one
division
of
the
old
northern
army
when
del

marched
for
estremadura

in
charge
of
this
portion
of
the
spanish
front
under
the
superintendence
of
mahy

he
had
placed
half
his
troops
five
battalions
or
men
in
astorga
while
he
himself
with
the
remainder
lay
beyond
the
mountains
at
villafranca
in
the
vierzo
with
about
the
same
force
the
total
of
organized
troops
in
galicia
at
this
moment
did
not
exceed
men
including
the
small
brigade
which
mahy
sent
to
the
asturias
and
a
detachment
under
echevarria
at
puebla
de
senabria
astorga
had
not
been
expecting
a
siege
at
such
an
early
date
as
february
it
was
only
provisioned
for
twenty
days
and
the
guns
had
not
ammunition
to
last
for
even
that
short
space
of
time
the
governor
josé
santocildes
was
a
man
of
courage
and
resource
who
knew
how
to
put
on
a
bold
face
to
an
impossible
situation
or
instant
disaster
might
have
followed
napoleon
to
berthier
see
loison
was
disconcerted
to
find
that
astorga
his
destined
head
quarters
was
held
and
garrisoned
against
him
his
engineers
reconnoitred
its
walls
and
informed
him
that
it
could
not
be
taken
without
a
regular
he
had
only
with
him
the
weather
was
abominable
and
his
troops
all
conscript
battalions
from
france
were
suffering
terribly
from
the
continued
rain
and
cold
wherefore
he
contented
himself
with
inviting
santocildes
to
surrender
promising
him
promotion
at
king
joseph
s
hands
if
he
would
implore
the
clemency
of
a
sovereign
who
treats
all
spaniards
like
a
father
when
the
governor
sent
a
curt
reply
intimating
that
he
and
his
people
intended
to
do
their
duty
loison
retired
to
la
baneza
and
reported
to
his
chiefs
that
he
was
helpless
for
want
of
he
announced
at
the
same
time
that
he
had
attempted
to
communicate
with
bonnet
at
oviedo
by
sending
two
battalions
to
the
foot
of
the
pass
of
pajares
but
that
the
mountain
roads
were
all
blocked
with
snow
and
that
this
detachment
had
been
forced
to
fall
back
into
the
plains
without
obtaining
any
news
of
what
was
afoot
in
the
asturias
a
few
days
later
the
head
of
junot
s
corps
entered
the
province
of
leon
and
loison
was
directed
to
move
southward
and
join
ney
at
salamanca
his
place
on
the
esla
and
the
orbigo
was
taken
by
clausel
s
division
of
the
corps
the
newly
arrived
general
executed
another
reconnaissance
to
the
neighbourhood
of
astorga
and
on
february
sent
santocildes
a
second
summons
in
the
name
of
junot
it
received
the
same
answer
that
had
been
given
to
loison
it
was
clear
that
astorga
must
be
besieged
and
that
a
battering
train
must
be
placed
at
the
disposition
of
the
force
charged
with
the
operation
but
in
the
present
state
of
the
roads
it
would
take
some
time
to
bring
heavy
guns
to
the
front
further
operations
had
to
be
postponed
the
corps
it
may
be
remarked
had
executed
at
the
same
time
that
loison
appeared
in
front
of
astorga
a
demonstration
against
ciudad
rodrigo
king
joseph
had
written
from
andalusia
to
beg
ney
to
threaten
the
place
while
the
news
of
the
french
victories
in
the
south
were
still
fresh
assuring
him
that
the
spaniards
were
so
cowed
that
a
prompt
surrender
was
probable
the
marshal
though
doubting
the
wisdom
of
these
optimistic
views
concentrated
his
corps
advanced
to
san
felices
and
on
february
summoned
rodrigo
he
got
from
general
herrasti
the
governor
an
answer
as
bold
and
confident
as
that
which
loison
received
from
santocildes
and
returned
to
salamanca
to
disperse
his
troops
in
cantonments
and
ask
for
a
his
short
and
ineffective
excursion
to
the
banks
of
the
agueda
had
taken
him
in
sight
of
the
british
outposts
on
the
spanish
frontier
and
had
induced
wellington
for
a
moment
to
think
that
the
invasion
of
portugal
was
at
hand
it
was
impossible
that
he
should
have
guessed
that
ney
s
advance
had
no
better
cause
than
king
joseph
s
foolish
confidence
hence
the
withdrawal
of
the
corps
after
the
vain
summons
of
ciudad
rodrigo
was
as
inexplicable
as
its
advance
i
do
not
understand
ney
s
movement
he
wrote
to
his
trusted
subordinate
robert
craufurd
coupled
as
it
is
with
the
movement
upon
badajoz
from
the
south
of
spain
the
french
are
not
strong
enough
for
the
two
sieges
at
the
same
time
and
i
much
doubt
whether
they
are
in
a
state
to
undertake
one
of
them
the
prompt
retirement
of
ney
from
before
ciudad
rodrigo
and
of
mortier
from
before
badajoz
completely
justified
his
conclusions
within
a
day
or
two
of
the
writing
of
his
letter
for

of

nothing
for

to
do
save
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
great
which
napoleon
had
bestowed
upon

of
portugal
it

far
to
the
rear
on
february
its
head
was
only
beginning
to
approach
burgos
and
its
tail
had
not
quitted
bayonne
the
reason
of
this
tardiness
was
the
want
of
draught
animals
at
the
southern
dépôts
of
france
the
equipment
of
the
train
and
the
artillery
of
the
corps
and
the
other
great
reinforcements
which
had
just
passed
the
pyrenees
had
exhausted
the
available
supplies
of
horses
and
when
the
authorities
at
bayonne
had
to
place
the
grand
park
on
a
war
footing
there
was
intolerable
delay
even
when
detachments
of
the
park
had
started
they
made
slow
progress
in
spain
for
the
french
horses
died
off
rapidly
in
the
bitter
weather
of
the
plateau
of
old
castile
and
it
was
almost
impossible
to
replace
them
by
requisition
from
the
junot
bold
to
the
verge
of
rashness
and
feverishly
anxious
to
remake
the
reputation
that
he
had
lost
at
vimiero
could
not
endure
the
delay
he
sent
to
requisition
spanish
guns
from
the
governors
of
burgos
and
segovia
dispatched
his
own
teams
to
draw
them
and
when
he
heard
that
a
small
train
was
procurable
ordered
the

towards
astorga

had
enabled
santocildes
to
fill
up
the
supply
of
food
and
ammunition
which
had
been
so
low
in
february
he
had
now
got
his
fortress
in
as
good
state
as
was
possible
considering
the
intrinsic
weakness
of
its
mediaeval
walls
and
had
induced
of
the
inhabitants
to
retire
to
galicia
even
the
corps
had
to
leave
guns
behind
at

followed

an
unusual
character

pleased

contented
himself
with
opening
fire
from
various
false
attacks
from

the
guns
were
repeatedly
moved
in

to
distract
the
attention
of
the
enemy
from
the
chosen
front
on

where
the
approaches
were
completed
and
a
great
battery
constructed

for

there
was
a
good
deal
of
infantry
skirmishing
in

about
the

the

ultimately
established
themselves

they
had
no

pushing
up

from

from

the

defended

executed

vigorous
sorties

lost
no

was

against

so
miserably
provided
with
guns
as
santocildes
junot
himself
came
up
on
the
to
watch
the
effect
of
the
attack
it
was
instant
and
overpowering
when
once
the
artillery
had
been
placed
in
the
works
prepared
for
it
and
had
begun
its
fire
the
old
walls
of
astorga
began
to
crumble
the
light
spanish
pieces
on
the
enceinte
were
overpowered
despite
of
the
gallant
way
in
which
the
gunners
stuck
to
their
work
by
noon
on
the
of
april
the
angle
of
the
walls
of
astorga
had
been
beaten
down
and
the
fallen
stones
there
being
no
ditch
had
accumulated
at
the
foot
of
the
broad
breach
so
as
to
give
an
easy
entrance
fortunately
for
the
defence
there
was
a
large
church
just
inside
the
angle
its
roof
and
tower
had
been
shot
down
but
the
garrison
had
made
themselves
strong
in
the
lower
parts
of
the
building
and
threw
up
traverses
from
it
to
the
wall
on
each
side
of
the
breach
this
gave
them
a
second
line
of
defence
though
but
a
weak
one
and
when
junot
sent
in
a
summons
in
the
afternoon
santocildes
refused
his
offer
at
seven
the
french
general
bade
men
storm
the
breach
the
forlorn
hope
was
composed
of
the
voltigeur
and
grenadier
companies
of
the
irish
legion
and
the
of
the
line
the
column
penetrated
to
the
foot
of
the
breach
without
much
difficulty
though
exposed
to
heavy
musketry
from
the
walls
and
a
flanking
fire
from
the
suburb
of
the
reteibia
the
breach
was
carried
and
in
addition
a
house
built
with
its
back
to
the
ramparts
just
inside
the
enceinte
but
the
assailants
could
get
no
further
owing
to
the
murderous
fire
which
the
spaniards
kept
up
from
behind
the
ruined
church
and
the
traverses
after
an
hour
of
desperate
attempts
to
break
in
they
took
shelter
some
in
the
house
that
they
had
captured
but
the
majority
behind
the
lip
of
the
breach
where
they
covered
themselves
as
best
they
could
by
piles
of
débris
built
in
with
their
haversacks
and
even
with
the
corpses
of
the
fallen
under
this
poor
shelter
they
lay
till
dark

heavily
during

ran
out
a
line
of
gabions
from

front

to
the
foot
of

walls
and
by
dawn
had
opened
a
good
communication
with
the
men
at

they
had
to
work
under

a

left
for

only
pounds

the
defence
had
been
admirable
and
it
may
be
added
very
scientific
a
fact
proved
by
the
low
figures
of
the
dead

which
did
not
amount

the

lost

junot
was
thought
to
have
been
precipitate
in
ordering
the
storm
his
excuse
was
that
there
were
less
than
two
hours
of
daylight
left
and
that
if
he
had
deferred
the
attack
till
next
morning
the
spaniards
would
have
retrenched
the
breach
under
cover
of
the

on
the
morning
of
the

made
a
feeble
demonstration
against
the
covering
troops
on
both
the
passes

manzanal

foncebadon
while
echevarria
beat
up
the

at

which
lay
facing

all
three

were
checked
with
ease
the
galician
army
not
being
able
to
put
more
than
men
in
the
field
on
the
three
fronts
taken
together
its
loss
was
heavy
especially
at
penilla
after
detaching
the
regiment
which
was
ordered
to
endeavour
to
communicate
with
bonnet
in
the
asturias

junot
drew
back
the
greater
part
of
his

to

he
had
been
ordered
to
place
himself
near
ney
in
order
to
aid
and
cover
the
corps
in
the
oncoming
siege
of
ciudad
rodrigo
at
the
same
time
he
received
the
unwelcome
news
that
masséna
had
been
named
of
the
army
of
portugal
and
that
the
corps
was
placed
under
his
orders
masséna
as
has
been
already
mentioned
did
not
arrive
at
salamanca
till
may
he
could
not
well
have
reached
the
front
earlier
since
the
emperor
had
only
placed
him
in
command
in
april
the
long
delay
in
the
opening
of
the
main
campaign
must
therefore
be
laid
to
napoleon
s
account
rather
than
to
that
of
his
generals
if
he
had
suspected
that
every
day
of
waiting
meant
that
wellington
had
added
an
extra
redoubt
to
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
it
is
permissible
to
believe
that
he
would
have
hurried
forward
matters
at
a
less
leisurely
pace
but
his
determination
to
conduct
the
invasion
of
portugal
in
what
he
called
a
methodical
fashion
is
sufficiently
shown
by
the
orders
sent
to
salamanca
on
may
tell
the
prince
of
essling
that
according
to
our
english
intelligence
the
army
of
general
wellington
is
composed
of
no
more
than
british
and
germans
and
that
his
portuguese
are
only
strong
i
do
not
wish
to
enter
lisbon
at
this
moment
because
i
could
not
feed
the
city
whose
immense
population
is
accustomed
to
live
on
food
he
can
spend
the
summer
months
in
taking
ciudad
rodrigo
and
then
almeida
he
need
not
hurry
but
can
go
methodically
to
work
the
english
general
having
less
than
cavalry
may
offer
battle
on
ground
where
cavalry
can
not
act
but
will
never
come
out
to
fight
in
the
plains
napoleon
to
berthier
may
the
emperor
then
proceeds
to
add
that
with
the
men
of
the
and
corps
the
cavalry
reserve
masséna
is
strong
enough
to
take
both
rodrigo
and
almeida
at
his
ease
reynier
and
the
corps
can
be
called
up
to
the
bridge
of
alcantara
from
whence
they
can
menace
central
portugal
and
cover
madrid
no
order
is
given
to
bring
up
this
corps
to
join
the
main
army
it
seems
that
the
emperor
at
this
moment
had
in
his
head
the
plan
with
which
wellington
always
credited
him
of
threatening
a
secondary
attack
in
the
tagus
valley
the
corps
is
treated
as
covering
masséna
s
left
while
on
his
right
he
will
be

is

whole
new

that
of

this
document
is
a
very
curious
product
of
the
imperial
pen
it
would
be
hard
to
find
in
the
rest
of
the
a
dispatch
which
so
completely
abandons
the
napoleonic
methods
of
quick
concentration
and
sharp
strokes
and
orders
a
delay
of
three
months
or
more
in
the
completion
of
a
campaign
whose
preliminary
operations
had
begun
so
far
back
as
february
we
may
reject
at
once
the
explanation
offered
by
some
of
napoleon
s
enemies
to
the
effect
that
he
was
jealous
of
masséna
and
did
not
wish
him
to
achieve
too
rapid
or
too
brilliant
a
success
but
it
is
clear
that
a
humanitarian
regard
for
the
possible
sufferings
of
the
inhabitants
of
lisbon
the
only
reason
alleged
for
the
delay
is
an
inadequate
motive
such
things
did
not
normally
affect
the
emperor
and
he
must
have
remembered
that
when
junot
occupied
portugal
at
the
of
famine
had
not
played
its
part
in
the
difficulties
encountered
by
the
french
nor
does
it
seem
that
an
exaggerated
estimate
of
the
enemy
s
strength
induced
him
to
postpone
the
attack
till
all
the
reinforcements
had
arrived
he
wellington
s
british
troops
by
some
his
portuguese
troops
by
at
least
men
he
is
utterly
ignorant
of
the
works
of
torres
vedras
though
six
months
labour
has
already
been
lavished
on
them
and
by
this
time
they
were
already
defensible
three
months
seem
an
altogether
exaggerated
time
to
devote
to
the
sieges
of
the
two
little
fortresses
of
ciudad
rodrigo
and
almeida
from
whence
then
comes
this
unprecedented
resolve
to
adopt
a
methodical
system
in
dealing
with
the
invasion
of
portugal
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
emperor
was
very
desirous
to
make
sure
of
the
absolute
suppression
of
the
guerrilleros
of
the
pyrenees
and
the
ebro
before
pushing
forward
his
field
army
to
lisbon
possibly
he
was
influenced
by
his
knowledge
of
the
infinite
difficulty
that
masséna
would
find
in
equipping
himself
with
a
train
and
more
especially
in
creating
magazines
during
the
months
before
the
harvest
had
been
gathered
in
some
have
thought
that
looking
far
forward
he
considered
it
would
be
more
disastrous
to
the
english
army
to
be
driven
into
the
sea
somewhere
in
the
rough
months
of
october
and
november
rather
than
in
the
fine
weather
of
june
and
undoubtedly
no
one
who
reads
his
dispatches
can
doubt
that
the
desire
to
deal
an
absolutely
crushing
blow
to
that
army
was
his
dominating
idea
throughout
but
probably
the
main
determining
factor
in
napoleon
s
mind
was
the
resolve
that
there
should
be
no
failure
this
time
for
want
of
preparation
or
want
of
sufficient
strength
that
no
risks
should
be
taken
and
that
what
he
regarded
as
an
overwhelming
force
should
be
launched
upon
portugal
after
junot
s
disaster
of
and
soult
s
fiasco
in
the
imperial
prestige
could
not
stand
a
third
failure
the
old
pledge
that
the
leopard
should
be
driven
into
the
sea
must
be
redeemed
at
all
costs
on
this
occasion
solid
success
rather
than
a
brilliant
campaign
must
be
the
end
kept
in
view
hence
came
the
elaborate
preparations
for
the
sustaining
of
masséna
s
advance
by
the
support
of
drouet
kellermann
and
serras
even
suchet
s
operations
in
eastern
spain
were
to
be
conducted
with
some
regard
to
the
affairs
of
portugal
it
was
a
broad
and
a
formidable
plan
but
it
failed
in
one
factor
wellington
s
strength
was
underrated
it
was
no
mere
driving
of
british
troops
into
the
sea
that
was
now
in
question
but
the
reduction
of
a
kingdom
where
every
man
had
been
placed
under
arms
and
every
preparation
made
for
passive
as
well
as
for
active
resistance
when
napoleon
was
once
more
foiled
it
was
because
he
had
treated
the
portuguese
army
a
de
as
he
called
them
as
a
negligible
quantity
and
because
he
had
foreseen
neither
that
systematic
devastation
of
the
land
nor
the
creation
of
those
vast
lines
in
front
of
lisbon
which
were
such
essential
features
of
wellington
s
scheme
of
defence
the
french
attack
was
delivered
by
men
not
by
the
whose
advent
the
british
general
had
feared
and
precisely
because
the
numbers
of
the
army
of
portugal
were
no
greater
the
attack
was
made
on
the
beira
frontier
only
masséna
had
no
men
to
spare
for
the
secondary
invasion
south
of
the
tagus
which
wellington
had
expected
and
dreaded
the
emperor
s
plans
went
to
wreck
because
he
had
his
enemy
and
assigned
too
small
a
force
to
his
lieutenant
but
it
was
no
ordinary
general
who
had
so
prepared
his
defence
that
napoleon
s
calculations
went
all
astray
the
genius
of
wellington
was
the
true
cause
of
the
disastrous
end
of
the
invasion

curious
dispatch

that

of

a

of

and
lofty
town
all
through

there
had
come
to

all
the
old
british
divisions

the
which
had
been
left
with

first
at

and
then
at

its
outposts
pushed
forward
to
the
line
of

the
portuguese
regular

which
were
afterwards
incorporated
in

british

were
still
lying
in

quarters
around

neither

in

thin
line
lay

it
was
otherwise
with
craufurd
who
was
placed
north
of
la

s
left
division
that
of
martin

he
was
in
close
touch
with
ney
s
corps
all
along
the
line
of
the
agueda
as
far
as
the
douro
since
the
outposts
of
the
corps
had
been
pushed
forward
on
march
the
commander
of
the
light
division
was
in
a
most
responsible
not
to
say
a
dangerous
position
the
main
army
was
forty
miles
to
his
rear
in
its
cantonments
at
vizeu
guarda
and
trancoso
he
had
with
him
of
british
infantry
only
the
first
battalions
of
the
and
with
one
battery
and
one
regiment
of
cavalry
the
hussars
of
the
king
s
german
legion
his
orders
were
to
keep
open
the
communication
with
ciudad
rodrigo
till
the
last
possible
moment
to
cover
almeida
as
long
as
was
prudent
and
to
keep
the
advised
of
every
movement
of
the
enemy
it
was
clear
that
he
might
be
thrust
back
at
any
moment
the
corps
since
loison
had
joined
it
was
strong
the
light
division
had
only
infantry
with
the
german
light
horse
on
march
wellington
sent
up
to
reinforce
craufurd
two
battalions
of
caçadores
the
and
the
latter
of
these
units
was
afterwards
changed
for
the
which
trained
by
elder
the
best
of
all
the
colonels
lent
to
the
portuguese
army
was
reckoned
the
most
efficient
corps
that
could
be
selected
from
beresford
s
command
but
the
two
caçador
battalions
only
added
bayonets
to
the
light
division
and
even
after
their
arrival
craufurd
s
force
was
less
than
strong
on
craufurd
s
complaint
that
the
caçadores
were
badly
commanded
and
too
full
of
boys
he
repeatedly
asked
for
and
ultimately
obtained
the
battalion
in
place
of
the
because
of
his
confidence
in
elder
robert
craufurd
though
only
a
brigadier
and
junior
of
his
rank
had
been
chosen
by
wellington
to
take
charge
of
his
outpost
line
because
he
was
one
of
the
very
few
officers
then
in
the
peninsula
in
whose
ability
his
had
perfect
confidence
nothing
is
more
striking
than
to
compare
the
tone
and
character
of
the
letters
which
wellington
wrote
to
him
with
those
which
he
dispatched
to
most
of
his
other
general
officers
only
with
craufurd
hill
and
beresford
did
he
ever
condescend
to
enter
into
explanations
and
state
reasons
the
rest
receive
orders
without
comment
which
they
are
directed
to
carry
out
and
are
given
no
opportunity
to
discuss
the
difference
was
noted
and
resented
by
the
others
when
on
march
craufurd
was
formally
given
charge
of
the
whole
outpost
line
of
the
army
and
his
seniors
picton
and
cole
were
told
to
conform
their
movements
to
his
without
waiting
for
orders
from
head
quarters
some
friction
was
engendered
picton
and
craufurd
in
especial
were
for
the
rest
of
the
campaign
in
a
state
of
latent
hostility
which
more
than
once
led
to
high
words
when
they
met
a
fact
which
was
not
without
its
dangers
to
the
welfare
of
the
army
note
especially
wellington
s
explanatory
dispatch
to
craufurd
of
march
where
he
even
goes
so
far
as
to
give
his
subordinate
a
free
hand
as
to
the
choice
of
his
line
you
must
be
a
better
judge
of
the
details
of
this
question
than
i
can
be
and
i
wish
you
to
consider
them
in
order
to
be
able
to
carry
the
plan
into
execution
when
i
shall
send
it
to
in
another
letter
wellington
writes
nothing
can
be
of
greater
advantage
to
me
than
to
have
the
benefit
of
your
opinion
on
i
intend
that
the
divisions
of
generals
cole
and
picton
should
support
you
on
the
coa
without
waiting
for
orders
from
me
if
it
should
be
necessary
and
they
shall
be
directed
march
from
vizeu
it
should
not
be
forgotten
that
picton
no
less
than
craufurd
was
at
this
time
living
down
an
old
disaster
but
picton
s
misfortune
had
not
been
military
it
was
the
celebrated
case
of
he
had
been
tried
for
permitting
the
use
of
torture
to
extract
evidence
against
criminals
while
governor
of
the
newly
conquered
island
of
trinidad
and
convicted
though
spanish
law
which
was
still
in
force
in
trinidad
apparently
permitted
of
the
practice
after
this
picton
was
a
marked
man
the
story
of
luisa
calderon
the
quadroon
girl
who
had
been
tortured
by
picketing
had
been
appearing
intermittently
in
the
columns
of
every
whig
paper
for
more
than
three
years
the
celebrated
commander
of
the
light
division
was
at
this
time
well
known
for
his
ability
but
reckoned
rather
an
unlucky
soldier
he
had
entered
the
army
so
far
back
as
and
had
seen
service
in
every
quarter
of
the
globe
yet
in
was
only
a
colonel
this
was
the
more
astounding
since
he
was
one
of
the
few
scientific
soldiers
in
the
british
army
when
the
revolutionary
war
broke
out
he
had
spent
some
time
at
berlin
in
studying
the
tactics
of
the
army
of
frederick
the
great
and
had
translated
into
english
the
official
prussian
treatise
on
the
art
of
war
his
knowledge
of
german
a
rare
accomplishment
in
the
british
army
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
caused
him
to
be
given
the
post
of
military
attaché
at
coburg
s
head
quarters
in
and
he
followed
the
austrian
army
through
all
the
disasters
of
that
and
the
two
following
years
again
in
he
went
out
to
take
the
same
post
at
the
head
quarters
of
the
army
of
switzerland
but
quitted
it
to
serve
on
the
staff
of
the
duke
of
york
during
the
miserable
dutch
expedition
of
that
same
year
he
seemed
destined
to
witness
nothing
but
disasters
and
though
he
was
known
to
have
done
his
duty
with
admirable
zeal
and
energy
in
every
post
that
he
occupied
promotion
lingered
probably
his
caustic
tongue
and
fiery
temper
were
his
hindrances
but
it
seems
astonishing
that
he
took
years
to
attain
the
rank
of
colonel
though
he
was
not
destitute
of
political
influence
having
friends
and
relatives
in
parliament
and
even
in
the
ministry
in
he
was
a
disappointed
man
thought
of
retiring
from
the
army
and
having
accepted
a
nomination
borough
sat
in
the
commons
for
five
years
in
he
was
at
last
made
a
colonel
and
in
the
following
year
went
on
active
service
with
the
expedition
which
sent
originally
to
the
cape
was
distracted
in
to
the
unhappy
buenos
ayres
campaign
this
was
the
zenith
of
his
misfortunes
it
was
he
who
placed
in
charge
of
a
light
brigade
by
the
incapable
whitelocke
was
thrust
forward
into
the
midst
of
the
tangled
streets
of
buenos
ayres
surrounded
in
the
convent
of
san
domingo
and
forced
to
capitulate
for
lack
of
support
at
the
ensuing
he
was
acquitted
of
all
blame
but
the
fact
that
he
had
surrendered
a
british
brigade
rankled
in
his
mind
for
the
rest
of
his
life
the
unshaken
confidence
in
his
abilities
felt
by
the
home
authorities
was
marked
by
the
fact
that
he
was
sent
out
in
october
with
baird
s
corps
which
landed
at
corunna
and
again
in
june
to
lisbon
each
time
in
command
of
a
brigade
but
his
bad
luck
seemed
still
to
attend
him
he
missed
the
victory
of
corunna
because
moore
had
detached
his
brigade
on
the
inexplicable
march
to
vigo
he
failed
to
be
present
at
talavera
despite
of
the
famous
forced
march
which
he
made
towards
the
sound
of
the
cannon
his
elder
brother
sir
charles
craufurd
was
and
for
retford
windham
the
secretary
for
war
was
his
devoted
friend
in
craufurd
was
burning
to
vindicate
his
reputation
and
to
show
that
the
confidence
which
wellington
placed
in
him
was
not
undeserved
he
still
regarded
himself
as
a
man
who
had
been
unjustly
dealt
with
and
had
never
been
given
his
chance
he
could
not
forget
that
he
was
four
years
older
than
beresford
five
years
older
than
wellington
eight
years
older
than
hill
yet
was
but
a
junior
in
charge
of
a
division
he
was
full
of
a
consuming
energy
on
the
for
slights
and
quarrels
a
very
strict
disciplinarian
restless
himself
and
leaving
his
troops
no
rest
he
was
not
liked
by
all
his
officers
in
the
light
division
he
had
many
admirers
and
many
bitter
critics
nor
was
he
at
first
popular
with
the
rank
and
file
though
they
soon
began
to
recognize
the
keen
intelligence
that
guided
his
actions
and
to
see
that
he
was
a
just
if
a
hard
master
in
the
matter
of
feeding
his
troops
the
most
difficult
task
imposed
on
a
general
of
the
peninsular
army
he
had
an
unparalleled
reputation
for
accomplishing
the
impossible
even
if
the
most
drastic
methods
had
to
be
employed
the
famous
old
story
about
wellington
and
the
commissary
had
craufurd
and
not
as
it
is
sometimes
told
picton
as
its
hero
as
a
sample
of
his
ways
it
may
be
mentioned
that
he
once
seized
and
impounded
some
till
the
villages
to
which
it
belonged
found
him
some
corn
for
his
starving
division
craufurd
on
one
of
his
happy
days
and
they
were
many
was
the
most
brilliant
subordinate
that
wellington
ever
owned
his
mistakes
and
he
committed
more
than
one
were
the
faults
of
an
ardent
and
ambitious
spirit
taking
an
immoderate
risk
in
the
hour
of
excitement
though
senior
in
the
date
of
his
first
commission
to
nearly
all
the
officers
of
the
peninsular
army
craufurd
was
six
years
junior
to
picton
and
one
year
junior
to
hope
graham

his
senior
in
age
had
only
entered
the

as

and

for
craufurd
s
life
and
personality
see
his
biography
by
his
grandson

rev
alex
craufurd
london
the
most
vivid
picture
of
him
is
in
rifleman
harris
s
chronicle
of
the
corunna
retreat
a
wonderful
piece
of
narrative
by
a
writer
from
the
ranks
who
admired
his
general
despite
of
all
his
severity
and
acknowledges
that
his
methods
were
necessary
though
napier
as
a
historian
is
on
the
whole
fairly
just
to
his
old
commander
whose
achievements
were
bound
up
indissolubly
with
the
glories
of
the
light
division
as
a
man
he
disliked
craufurd
in
one
of
his
hooks
which
i
possess
delagrave
s
de
he
has
written
in
the
margin
several
bitter
personal
remarks
about
him
very
unlike
the
language
employed
in
his
history
the
unpublished
journal
of
colonel
mcleod
of
the
is
as
alex
craufurd
informs
me
written
in
the
same
spirit
so
is
charles
napier
s
from
march
to
july
craufurd
in
charge
of
the
whole
outpost
system
of
wellington
s
army
accomplished
the
extraordinary
feat
of
guarding
a
front
of
forty
miles
against
an
active
enemy
of
sixfold
force
without
suffering
his
line
to
be
pierced
or
allowing
the
french
to
gain
any
information
whatever
of
the
dispositions
of
the
host
in
his
rear
he
was
in
constant
and
daily
touch
with
ney
s
corps
yet
was
never
surprised
and
never
thrust
back
save
by
absolutely
overwhelming
strength
he
never
lost
a
detachment
never
failed
to
detect
every
move
of
the
enemy
and
never
sent
his
commander
false
intelligence
this
was
the
result
of
system
and
science
not
merely
of
vigilance
and
activity
the
journal
of
his
aide
de
camp
giving
the
daily
work
of
the
light
division
during
the
critical
months
of
might
serve
as
an
illustrative
manual
of
outpost
duty
and
was
indeed
printed
for
that
purpose
in
as
an
appendix
to
lord
s
of
outpost
craufurd
s
one
cavalry
regiment
the
german
hussars
had
to
cover
a
front
of
nearly
forty
miles
and
performed
the
duty
admirably
it
had
been
chosen
for
the
service
because
it
was
considered
by
wellington
superior
in
scouting
power
to
any
of
his
british
light
cavalry
corps
general
craufurd
worked
out
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
outpost
duty
with
them
he
had
the
great
advantage
of
speaking
german
fluently
and
he
arranged
for
the
outpost
duties
of
the
different
parts
of
the
long
line
that
he
had
to
guard
by
his
personal
communications
with
the
captains
of
that
admirable
corps
men
who
were
themselves
masters
of
the
subject
they
each
knew
his
plan
for
the
space
that
they
covered
though
not
his
general
plan
and
each
worked
out
his
part
most
admirably
the
general
communicated
with
them
direct
he
had
the
great
advantage
of
possessing
with
his
great
abilities
and
energy
uncommon
bodily
strength
so
that
he
could
remain
on
horseback
almost
any
length
of
time
when
his
operations
began
the
point
to
be
observed
was
the
line
of
the
agueda
extending
for
some
forty
miles
the
country
although
very
irregular
in
its
surface
was
quite
open
and
unenclosed
and
fit
almost
everywhere
for
the
action
of
all
three
arms
when
he
took
up
the
line
he
kept
his
infantry
back
entirely
with
the
exception
of
four
companies
of
the
rifles
above
the
bridge
of
barba
del
puerco
upon
the
of
the
time
that
would
be
required
to
retire
the
infantry
behind
the
coa
after
he
received
information
from
the
cavalry
of
the
enemy
s
advance
if
we
are
properly
to
understand
craufurd
s
operations
the
must
never
be
lost
sight
of
for
it
was
on
calculations
that
he
acted
all
along
the
hazarding
of
the
four
companies
at
barba
del
puerco
forms
a
separate
consideration
it
rested
on
the
belief
that
the
pass
there
was
so
difficult
that
four
companies
could
defend
it
against
any
numbers
and
that
if
they
were
turned
higher
up
the
river
the
hussars
would
give
the
rifles
warning
in
ample
time
for
a
safe
retreat
special
reports
were
made
of
the
state
of
the
fords
of
the
agueda
morning
and
the
rapidity
of
its
rises
was
particularly
marked
an
officer
had
special
charge
of
all
deserters
from
the
enemy
to
examine
them
and
bring
together
their
information
beacons
were
prepared
on
conspicuous
heights
so
as
to
communicate
information
as
to
the
enemy
s
offensive
movements
to
ensure
against
mistakes
in
the
night
pointers
were
kept
at
the
stations
of
communication
directed
to
the
beacons
as
napier
has
remarked
in
his
history
sufficed
for
the
division
to
get
under
arms
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
night
or
day
to
bring
it
in
order
of
battle
to
its
with
the
baggage
loaded
and
assembled
at
a
convenient
distance
to
the
rear
and
this
not
upon
a
concerted
signal
nor
as
a
trial
but
at
all
times
and
certain
one
of
the
most
curious
points
in
s
is
that
from
the
reports
of
deserters
craufurd
succeeded
in
reconstructing
the
exact
composition
of
ney
s
corps
in
brigades
and
battalions
with
a
final
error
of
only
one
battalion
and
men
too
few
pp
and
to
complete
the
picture
it
remains
to
be
added
that
there
were
some
fifteen
fords
between
ciudad
rodrigo
and
the
mouth
of
the
agueda
which
were
practicable
in
dry
weather
for
all
arms
and
that
several
of
them
could
be
used
even
after
a
day
or
two
of
rain
the
french
were
along
the
whole
river
they
had
horse
available
in
march
and
april
in
may
and
june
their
infantry
at
some
points
were
only
three
or
four
miles
back
from
the
river
yet
craufurd
s
line
was
never
broken
nor
was
even
a
picket
of
ten
men
cut
off
or
surrounded
the
least
movement
of
the
enemy
was
reported
along
the
whole
front
in
an
incredibly
short
time
the
whole
web
of
communication
quivered
at
the
slightest
touch
and
the
division
was
immediately
ready
to
fight
or
to
draw
back
according
as
the
strength
of
the
french
dictated
boldness
or
caution
during
february
wellington
had
rightly
concluded
that
craufurd
had
nothing
to
fear
ney
s
early
demonstration
against
ciudad
rodrigo
had
no
more
serious
significance
than
mortier
s
similar
appearance
in
front
of
badajoz
but
when
march
arrived
and
the
corps
appeared
in
the
plains
of
leon
and
commenced
the
siege
of
astorga
while
ney
began
to
move
up
his
cavalry
to
the
line
of
the
yeltes
and
loison
s
division
coming
from
astorga
established
itself
on
the
lower
agueda
it
seemed
likely
that
serious
work
would
soon
begin
the
first
test
of
the
efficiency
of
craufurd
s
outpost
system
was
made
on
the
night
of
march
when
ferey
commanding
the
brigade
of
loison
s
division
which
lay
at
san
felices
assembled
his
six
voltigeur
companies
before
dawn
and
made
a
dash
at
the
pass
of
barba
del
puerco
he
had
the
good
luck
to
bayonet
the
sentries
at
the
bridge
before
they
could
fire
and
was
half
way
up
the
rough
ascent
from
the
bridge
to
the
village
when
beckwith
s
detachment
of
the
rifles
roused
and
armed
in
ten
minutes
were
upon
him
they
drove
him
down
the
defile
and
chased
him
back
across
the
river
with
the
loss
of
two
officers
and
men
killed
and
wounded
beckwith
s
riflemen
lost
one
officer
and
three
men
killed
and
ten
men
wounded
in
the
three
companies
engaged
after
this
alarm
craufurd
was
in
anxious
expectation
of
a
general
advance
of
the
corps
and
made
every
preparation
to
receive
them
but
ferey
s
reconnaissance
had
no
sequel
and
a
whole
month
passed
by
without
any
serious
move
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
the
agueda
was
in
flood
for
the
greater
part
of
april
owing
to
incessant
rains
which
made
the
outpost
work
simple
as
the
number
of
points
to
be
observed
went
down
from
fifteen
to
three
or
four
it
was
not
till
the
that
maucune
s
and
ferey
s
brigades
moved
up
close
to
ciudad
rodrigo
drove
in
the
spanish
outposts
and
formed
the
blockade
of
the
place
on
the
east
side
of
the
agueda
even
then
its
bridge
remained
unmolested
and
craufurd
could
communicate
quite
freely
with
the
garrison
and
did
so
till
june
masséna
at
a
later
date
blamed
ney
for
having
established
this
partial
and
useless
blockade
before
he
was
ready
to
commence
the
siege
in
earnest
the
two
french
brigades
consumed
during
the
month
of
may
the
whole
of
the
local
resources
of
the
district
around
rodrigo
so
that
when
the
rest
of
the
army
came
up
all
supplies
had
to
be
brought
up
from
a
great
distance
it
may
also
be
remarked
that
to
advance
a
corps
of
no
more
than
men
within
striking
distance
of
the
british
army
would
have
been
very
hazardous
if
wellington
had
been
entertaining
any
designs
of
taking
the
offensive
and
ney
at
this
time
could
not
have
been
sure
that
such
a
contingency
was
unlikely
the
only
advantage
which
the
marshal
got
from
keeping
his
detachment
so
close
to
the
fortress
was
that
in
their
month
of
waiting
the
brigades
were
able
to
prepare
a
great
store
of
gabions
and
fascines
and
the
engineers
to
make
a
thorough
survey
of
the
environs
ciudad
rodrigo
stands
on
a
single
circular
knoll
of
no
great
height
whose
summit
it
exactly
covers
it
is
a
small
place
of
some
souls
packed
tight
in
narrow
streets
within
a
stout
mediaeval
wall
thickly
set
with
towers
a
castle
on
which
the
houses
press
in
too
close
for
strength
fills
its
corner
there
is
no
other
inner
place

the

into
several
channels

southern
side
of

crossed
by
a
bridge

commanded
by

walls

at
its
highest
on
the
opposite
face
it
is
much
less
steep
and
only
very
slightly
exceeds
the
level
of
the
surrounding
ground
round
the
circuit
of
the
mediaeval
wall
a
low
modern
enceinte
had
been
constructed
and
served
as
an
outer
protection
it
was
only
twelve
feet
high
so
did
not
shield
more
than
a
third
of
the
inner
wall
which
could
be
battered
over
its
summit
its
outline
was
zigzagged
in
the
form
of
redans
and
it
was
furnished
with
a
dry
ditch
its
glacis
owing
to
the
rising
of
the
knoll
gave
it
little
protection
so
that
both
the
older
and
the
modern
wall
could
be
searched
for
the
greater
part
of
their
height
by
the
artillery
of
a
besieger
outside
the
eastern
gate
of
rodrigo
lies
the
straggling
suburb
of
san
francisco
on
very
low
ground
it
was
so
large
and
so
close
to
the
walls
that
the
governor
herrasti
considered
it
absolutely
necessary
to
take
it
inside
the
circuit
of
his
defences
it
had
accordingly
been
surrounded
by
a
strong
earthwork
and
the
three
great
monasteries
which
it
contains
san
francisco
san
domingo
and
santa
clara
had
been
strengthened
and
loopholed
the
small
suburb

just
across

retrenched
and
manned
as
was
also
the
convent

which
stands
isolated
yards
outside
the
angle

other
outlying
buildings
had
been
levelled
to
the
ground
lest
they
should
afford
cover
to

illustration
siege
of
ciudad
rodrigo
these
preparations
were
very
wise
and
helpful
but
they
did
not
do
away
with
the
main
weakness
of
ciudad
rodrigo
considered
as
a
modern
fortress
like
many
other
mediaeval
strongholds
it
is
commanded
by
outlying
heights
which
could
be
disregarded
as
an
element
of
danger
in
the
fourteenth
or
the
sixteenth
century
because
of
their
distance
but
became
with
the
improvement
of
artillery
in
this
case
two
knolls
considerably
higher
than
that
on
which
the
place
stands
lie
outside
its
northern
walls
the
smaller
named
the
little
teson
lies
only
yards
from
the
northern
angle
of
the
town
it
is
some
fifty
feet
higher
than
the
base
of
the
ramparts
immediately
behind
it
rises
the
great
teson
which
dominates
the
whole
its
broad
flat
top
of
a
mile
in
diameter
being
a
hundred
feet
above
the
level
of
the
plain
it
was
hopeless
to
think
of
holding
the
little
teson
as
an
outwork
since
the
greater
one
looks
down
into
it
and
searches
it
from
end
to
end
the
great
teson
on
the
other
hand
is
so
large
its
circuit
is
about
the
same
as
the
city
itself
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
think
of
defending
it
as
when
entrenched
it
would
require
a
garrison
of
at
least
men
and
herrasti
had
but
troops
under
his
command
its
slopes
moreover
are
gentle
and
do
not
lend
themselves
to
fortification
the
southern
edge
of
the
plateau
of
the
great
teson
being
only
yards
from
the
town
wall
it
was
obvious
that
here
was
the
place
from
which
rodrigo
could
best
be
assailed
batteries
on
its
could
breach
both
the
inner
and
outer
walls
and
could
command
every
square
foot
both
of
the
town
and
of
the
fortified
suburbs
accordingly
the
brigades
which
lay
before
the
place
in
may
had
encamped
on
and
behind
the
teson
and
stored
the
gabions
fascines
and
sandbags
which
they
were
making
in
a
park
near
the
convent
of
la
caridad
and
the
village
of
pedro
de
toro
on
its
further
side
herrasti
as
we
have
said
had
a
garrison
of
men
composed
of
one
line
battalion
two
militia
battalions
three
battalions
of
new
levies
from
the
town
and
its
vicinity
called
voluntarios
de
ciudad
rodrigo
and
one
battalion
of
urban
guards
none
of
these
troops
save
the
line
battalion
of
majorca
which
had
formed
part
of
the
old
army
of
estremadura
had
ever
been
under
fire
a
fact
which
makes
their
fine
defence
all
the
more
creditable
there
were
only
officers
and
men
of
the
artillery
of
the
line
in
the
place
these
had
to
train
men
assigned
to
them
from
the
infantry
but
fortunately
the
long
delay
in
the
opening
of
the
siege
had
allowed
the
instruction
to
be
thoroughly
carried
out
of
engineers
there
were
only
officers
and
sappers
of
cavalry
none
but
the
partisan
chief
julian
sanchez
with
some
of
his
lancers
chanced
to
be
in
the
place
on
the
day
when
it
was
completely
invested
and
was
forced
to
cut
his
way
out
when
the
bombardment
began
perhaps
the
main
strength
of
ciudad
rodrigo
as
of
gerona
lay
in
the
personality
of
its
governor
general
andrés
herrasti
a
veteran
of
nearly
seventy
years
was
determined
to
do
his
duty
and
showed
as
much
ingenuity
and
readiness
as
obstinacy
in
his
defence

though
the
french
had
appeared
before
the
walls
of
ciudad
rodrigo
on
april
it
was
not
till
may
that
ney
came
up
in
person
with
four
brigades
of
infantry
and
montbrun
s
division
of
reserve
cavalry
to
complete
the
investment
the
main
cause
of
the
delay
was
as
usual
the
lack
of
supplies
ney
had
to
levy
and
forward
from
salamanca
two
months
rations
for
an
army
of
men
and
could
only
do
so
after
long
and
harassing
preparation

nearly
came
to
actual
blows
with

joseph

the
matter

he
sent

his
troops
under

and
refused
to
allow
the

an
imperial
rescript
however
soon
arrived
which
placed
avila
at
the
disposition

at

is
miles
from
ciudad

so
that
the
corps
deducting
the
outlying
brigades
could
have
joined
ney
in
two
days
these
distances
were
the
governing
factor
in
wellington
s
policy
during
the
next
month
ney
had
men
of
the
corps
and
montbrun
s
dragoons
in
front
of
rodrigo
junot
could
join
him
with
infantry
and
cavalry
in
a
day
a
second
day
would
bring
up
solignac
with
men
more
unless
the
corps
could
be
surprised
in
its
camps
and
forced
to
fight
before
it
received
its
reinforcements
there
would
be
french
to
face
of
their
numbers
wellington
was
roughly
aware
the
figures
sent
in
to
him
by
craufurd
were
accurate
to
within
a
few
thousands
and
estimated
the
enemy
at
men
the
s
own
calculation
was
even
nearer
the
truth
early
in
may
he
reckoned
ney
with
loison
s
division
included
at
men
junot
and
kellermann
at
early
in
june
he
made
out
that
the
two
corps
in
his
front
without
kellermann
amounted
to
men
which
was
only
over
the
true
total
he
himself
had
at
this
moment
only
british
troops
under
his
hand
and
within
striking
distance
he
had
on
april
brought
up
his
head
quarters
and
the
division
to
celorico
and
moved
forward
picton
and
the
division
to
pinhel
while
cole
with
the
remained
at
guarda
and
the
light
division
was
as
usual
facing
the
agueda
the
cavalry
had
also
come
up
from
the
mondego
valley
and
lay
behind
almeida
moreover
the
five
portuguese
brigades
of
harvey
collins
pack
coleman
and
alex
campbell
were
ordered
up
to
the
front
and
joined
the
army
in
the
first
days
of
may
wellington
thereupon
incorporated
harvey
s
brigade
with
the
division
and
collins
s
with
the
a
system
which
he
afterwards
carried
out
with
nearly
all
the
portuguese
units
the
whole
of
this
mass
of
troops
came
to
some
men
these
with
the
british
making
a
total
of
men
were
all
that
wellington
could
count
upon
for
he
could
not
dare
to
move
hill
s
men
from
the
south
where
they
were
observing
reynier
nor
to
displace
the
small
reserve
which
lay
at
abrantes
and
thomar
to
guard
against
a
possible
french
move
along
the
tagus
by
castello
branco
lisbon
could
not
be
left
unprotected
on
this
side
so
long
as
reynier
lay
between
the
tagus
and
the
guadiana
may
to
craufurd
on
june
craufurd
calculated
the
troops
in
front
of
ciudad
rodrigo
by
counting
regiments
and
battalions
at
over
men
there
were
really
and
the
came
from
allowing
only
men
to
a
battalion
while
they
really
averaged
about
the
same
time
craufurd
estimated
the
parts
of
junot
s
corps
in
the
neighbourhood
to
be
men
they
were
really
nearly
the
cause
of
error
was
the
same
see

pages
the
estimates
are
corrected
on
fuller
information

in
july

of
whom
nearly
half
would
have
consisted
of
the
newly
organised
portuguese
brigades
of
which
hardly
a
battalion
had
been
under
fire
he
would
have
had

face
and
a
marked
inferiority
in
artillery
also
no
practical
assistance
could
have
been
got
by
inviting
the
of
martin
carrera
s
depleted
spanish
division
of
men
which
lay
on
the
hills
about
the
sources
of
the
agueda
watching
ney
s
flank
if
the
first
stroke
should
fail
and
ney
were
not
surprised
wellington
would
have
junot
s
men
to
count
with
within
hours
ciudad
rodrigo
lies
on
a
plain
a
full
day
s
march
from
the
hills
and
by
advancing
to
relieve
it
the
british
army
must
commit
itself
to
an
action
in
the
open
it
is
no
wonder
then
that
wellington
refused
to
attempt
the
movement
weak
in
cavalry
and
with
troops
of
uncertain
value
in
his
ranks
he
would
have
been
mad
to
embark
upon
such
an
operation
it
was
most
improbable
that
ney
could
have
been
surprised
and
forced
to
fight
without
junot
s
aid
when
he
had
horsemen
at
hand
to
discover
and
report
the
first
movement
of
the
napoleon
had
been
right
when
he
told
masséna
that
it
was
practically
impossible
that
wellington
would
offer
battle
in
the
plains
herrasti
had
been
sent
assurances
that
the
british
army
would
do
anything
that
was
feasible
for
his
relief
but
he
was
warned
in
a
supplementary
letter
of
june
that
it
might
be
impossible
to
aid
him
you
will
believe
wrote
wellington
that
if
i
should
not
be
able
to
attempt
your
relief
it
will
be
owing
to
the
superior
strength
of
the
enemy
and
to
the
necessity
for
my
attending
to
other
important
objects
notwithstanding
this
caution
it
would
appear
that
the
spanish
governor
still
hoped
for
prompt
assistance
it
seemed
to
him
as
it
did
to
all
spanish
and
some
english
officers
at
the
time
that
wellington
would
not
be
able
to
endure
the
spectacle
of
ciudad
rodrigo
being
taken
while
his
outposts
were
lying
only
six
miles
in
front
of
it
those
who
held
such
views
little
knew
the
inflexible
character
of
the
man
with
whom
they
had
to
deal
or
his
contempt
for
considerations
of
pride
or
sentiment
to
take
a
great
risk
when
victory
would
mean
only
the
raising
of
the
siege
of
rodrigo
till
junot
and
kellermann
should
have
joined
ney
while
defeat
might
mean
the
loss
of
portugal
was
not
in
consonance
with
wellington
s
character
the
possible
gain
and
loss
were
too
unequal
and
he
very
rightly
and
not
without
much
regret
remained
in
observation
at
celorico
he
sums
up
the
matter
thus
i
must
leave
the
mountains
and
cross
the
plains
as
well
as
two
rivers
to
raise
the
siege
to
do
this
i
have
about
men
including
carrera
s
spaniards
of
which
are
cavalry
included
are
spaniards
and
portuguese
which
troops
to
say
the
best
of
them
are
of
doubtful
quality
is
it
right
under
these
circumstances
to
risk
a
general
action
to
raise
the
siege
of
ciudad
rodrigo
i
should
think
not
and
again
my
object
is
to
be
able
to
relieve
the
place
if
it
should
be
advisable
to
attempt
it
in
consequence
of
any
alteration
in
the
enemy
s
force
this
does
not
appear
to
be
a
very
probable
event
at
present
and
ought
not
to
be
provided
for
according
to
the
common
rules
of
prudence
at
any
considerable
risk
expressions
of
regret
are
added
i
do
not
give
the
matter
up
if
they
hold
out
like
men
they
are
worth
saving
and
under
certain
circumstances
it
might
be
possible
to
incur
the
but
the
certain
circumstances
never
came
about
they
seem
to
have
been
the
possibility
either
that
ney
or
junot
might
make
detachments
or
move
their
corps
into
a
less
concentrated
position
than
they
at
present
occupied
or
that
they
might
form
a
covering
army
and
advance
to
drive
him
off
from
his
present
quarters
which
were
too
close
to
ciudad
rodrigo
for
their
comfort
this
last
contingency
almost
happened
as
we
shall
see
probably
if
the
enemy
had
come
out
to
attack
him
wellington
would
have
accepted
battle
in
one
of
the
defensive
positions
that
he
knew
so
well
how
to
select
vi
d
urban
for
example
wrote
in
his
journal
on
june
that
he
took
the
daring
step
of
suggesting
a
surprise
attack
on
ney
to
the
general
no
notice
was
taken
of
his
suggestion
picton
summed
up
the
situation
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
see
robinson
s
of
i
very
clearly
if
we
attempt
to
relieve
the
place
the
french
will
drive
us
out
of
portugal
while
if
they
get
possession
of
it
they
will
lose
time
which
is
more
important
to
them
than
ciudad
rodrigo
but
they
have
got
to
find
this
a
slight
as
it
would
seem
for
with
la
carrera
s
force
the
whole
would
have
been
sabres
and
bayonets
of
the
cavalry
were
portuguese
and
spaniards
wellington
to
henry
wellesley
june
wellington
to
craufurd
june
ney
as
has
been
already
mentioned
arrived
before
the
fortress
with
some
men
on
may
on
june
he
threw
a
bridge
across
the
agueda
a
mile
and
a
half
above
rodrigo
but
sent
no
troops
across
it
two
days
later
masséna
came
up
from
the
rear
approved
of
the
plan
that
had
been
formed
for
breaching
the
city
from
the
side
of
the
two
tesons
and
having
reviewed
the
corps
took
his
way
back
to
salamanca
at
this
moment
he
gave
orders
to
reynier
and
the
corps
to
leave
truxillo
and
the
valley
of
the
guadiana
and
to
cross
the
tagus
to
coria
and
plasencia
from
whence
they
could
threaten
castello
branco
and
abrantes
this
was
in
accordance
with
the
orders
of
the
emperor
who
had
bidden
him
call
up
reynier
from
the
guadiana
to
cover
his
flank
such
a
movement
had
been
foreseen
by
wellington
who
as
early
as
june
had
directed
hill
to
leave
portalegre
with
his
men
and
to
cross
the
tagus
at
villa
velha
the
moment
that
reynier
should
have
passed
it
at
almaraz
some
days
later
the
galician
general
mahy
sent
to
the
british
head
quarters
four
duplicates
of
napoleon
s
dispatches
to
masséna
and
king
joseph
which
had
been
intercepted
by
guerrillas
on
the
way
to
salamanca
they
corroborated
all
wellington
s
suspicions
and
enabled
him
to
provide
against
the
danger
on
this
side
even
before
it
had
begun
to
arise
hill
s
route
by
villa
velha
being
appreciably
shorter
than
that
of
reynier
he
was
in
position
beyond
the
tagus
before
the
corps
had
reached
coria
their
cavalry
met
and
skirmished
at
ladoeiro
on
the
branco
road
on
july
thus
the
relative
position
of
the
two
hostile
forces
in
the
south
was
exactly
preserved
wellington
knew
that
he
could
call
in
hill
to
join
his
main
army
as
quickly
as
masséna
could
draw
reynier
to
himself
through
the
pass
of
perales
the
only
route
possible
for
him
he
felt
all
the
more
secure
because
he
had
now
some
british
troops
at
abrantes
ready
to
support
hill
three
newly
arrived
battalions
which
landed
at
lisbon
early
in
april
had
been
passed
up
the
tagus
to
thomar
and
the
line
of
the
zezere
where
uniting
with
two
portuguese
brigades
they
formed
leith
s
division
a
fresh
factor
in
the
situation
this
detachment
with
two
batteries
added
could
assist
hill
with
men
if
reynier
should
push
forward
in
the
direction
of
castello
branco
wellington
to
hill
july
these
were
napoleon
s
dispatches
nos
and
as
is
shown
by
the
excellent
analysis
of
them
given
by
d
urban
in
his
diary
he
read
them
over
with
beresford
on
july
no
was
very
valuable
as
giving
the
exact
strength
of
the
and
corps
the
first
absolutely
certain
analysis
of
them
that
wellington
obtained
these
were
the
which
arrived
at
lisbon
april
leith
s
division
was
formally
constituted
only
on
july
but
really
existed
since
june
whether
at
this
moment
masséna
was
proposing
to
order
a
serious
attack
on
this
side
or
whether
he
was
from
the
first
intending
to
bring
up
the
corps
to
join
the
main
army
is
not
certain
napoleon
in
some
of
his
dispatches
seems
to
recommend
the
rather
hazardous
attack
on
double
external
lines
a
result
of
his
general
of
wellington
s
resisting
power
on
may
he
told
his
lieutenant
that
with
men
of
the
and
corps
he
could
capture
both
ciudad
rodrigo
and
almeida
and
then
march
methodically
into
portugal
while
reynier
at
alcantara
could
cover
the
communication
with
madrid
and
menace
upper

le
prince

position
sans

masséna
however
did
not
think
his
main
army
strong
enough
and
being
left
a
free
hand
by
his
master
ultimately
called
in
reynier
to
join
him
and
so
freed
wellington
from
the
harassing
doubt
as
to
whether
he
might
not
have
to
defend
himself
on
the
zezere
and
on
the
mondego
at
the
same
moment
long
before
the
orders
reached
the
corps
to
move
up
from
truxillo
to
coria
and
zarza
the
siege
of
rodrigo
had
begun
in
earnest
on
june
as
we
have
already
seen
ney
had
cast
a
bridge
across
the
agueda
above
the
town
four
days
later
a
second
was
constructed
at
the
ford
of
lora
below
the
place
the
moment
that
it
was
completed
marchand

division
half
mermet
s
and
the
light
cavalry
brigade
of
lamotte
crossed
the
river
and
established
camps
on
its
western
bank
the
horsemen
pushed
back
craufurd
s
pickets
to
marialva
and
manzanilla
and
completely
cut
his
communication
with
rodrigo
which
had
hitherto
been
intermittently
open
the
troops
which
had
passed
the
river
threw
up
redoubts
to
cover

and
slightly
entrenched
their
camps

of

which
continued
to
come
in
by

next

guns
in
hand

teson
on
a
front
of
yards
it
was
only
yards
from
the
glacis
of
the
town
herrasti
kept
up
a
furious
fire
upon
it
and
vexed
the
workmen
by
two
sorties
which
were
not
pressed
home
and
did
no
harm
on
the
six
batteries
on
the
teson
were
commenced
the
work
was
easy
owing
to
the
great
store
of
gabions
and
sandbags
already
in
store
which
the
brigades
of
maucune
and

had
prepared
in

right
end
of

slopes

approaches

julian

that

not

got

he
came
into
craufurd
s
camp
and
gave
a
full
report
of
the
state
of
the
garrison
and
the
progress
of
the
enemy
s
works
it
was
impossible
for
the
french
to
open
their
second
parallel
so
long
as
the
convent
of
santa
cruz
was
held
for
the
fire
of
this
outwork
would
have
enfiladed
its
whole
length
on
the
night
of
the
therefore
ney
tried
to
storm
the
convent
with
a
picked
body
of
grenadiers
they
blew
in
its
door
with
a
petard
and
set
fire
to
its
lower
story
but
were
finally
driven
off
the
convent
was
partially
destroyed
but
the
garrison
gallantly
clung
to
its
ruins
and
covered
themselves
in
the
débris
the
french
lost
fifteen
killed
and
fifty
wounded
that
night
on
june
the
batteries
opened
without
waiting
for
the
reduction
of
santa
cruz
with
guns
placed
in
six
batteries
along
the
crest
of
the
teson
the
of
the
besieged
was
very
effective
two
expense
magazines
containing
lb
of
powder
were
blown
up
in
the
trenches
many
guns
dismounted
and
one
battery
silenced
the
loss
of
the
besiegers
was
heavy
the
spaniards
suffered
less
but
fires
broke
out
in
several
quarters
of
the
town
from
the
shells
thrown
by
the
french
mortars
and
many
houses
were
destroyed
the
ruins
of
the
convent
of
santa
cruz
moreover
were
so
thoroughly
battered
to
pieces
that
the
garrison
retired
when
an
assault
was
made
upon
it
by
grenadiers
after
nightfall
this
enabled
the
french
to
push
forward
their
works
much
nearer
to
the
town
masséna
came
up
from
salamanca
this
day
to
inspect
the
bombardment
and
made
as
was
his
wont
a
rather
mendacious
report
thereon
to
the
emperor
declaring
that
the
french
loss
had
been
killed
and
wounded
whereas
it
had
exceeded
see
belmas
iii
and
that
the
defence
of
the
place
was
seriously
impaired
which
it
was
not
as
yet
four
days
of
furious
artillery
engagement
followed
in
which
the
besiegers
though
suffering
heavily
succeeded
not
only
in
setting
more
than
half
the
town
on
fire
but
what
was
more
serious
in
making
a
breach
in
the
at
the
projecting
angle
of
the
north
side
of
the
city
on
which
four
of
the
batteries
had
been
trained
and
in
injuring
the
inner
mediaeval
wall
at
the
back
of
it
believing
wrongly
as
it
seems
that
the
breach
was
practicable
ney
sent
an
officer
to
summon
the
town
herrasti
replied
that
he
was
still
in
a
position
to
defend
himself
and
that
after
years
of
service
he
knew
the
laws
of
war
and
his
military
he
made
however
the
unusual
request
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
send
a
letter
to
wellington
and
that
a
suspension
of
arms
should
be
granted
till
the
return
of
his
messenger
the
marshal
as
was
natural
sent
a
refusal
and
ordered
the
bombardment
to
recommence
june
up
to
this
moment
the
french
engineers
had
been
under
the
impression
that
ciudad
rodrigo
would
probably
surrender
when
it
had
been
breached
without
standing
an
assault
now
that
they
recognized
that
the
governor
intended
to
fight
to
the
last
and
noted
that
he
had
spent
the
night
following
the
summons
in
clearing
the
ditch
and
repairing
the
damaged
with
sandbags
they
resolved
that
the
breaching
batteries
must
be
brought
closer
in
and
the
approaches
pushed
up
to
the
foot
of
the
walls
accordingly
a
second
parallel
was
opened
along
the
front
of
the
little
teson
two
hundred
and
fifty
yards
in
advance
of
the
first
on
the
night
of
july
on
the
same
night
a
column
of
men
stormed
the
convent
of
san
francisco
in
the
suburb
a
post
which
would
have
enfiladed
the
southern
end
of
the
new
parallel
in
the
most
dangerous
fashion
having
obtained
this
lodgement
in
the
suburb
the
french
set
to
work
to
conquer
the
whole
of
it
and
after
some
stiff
stormed
santa
clara
its
central
stronghold
herrasti
thereupon
evacuated
the
rest
of
the
scattered
houses
and
withdrew
all
his
troops
inside
the
town
july
the
new
battery
on
the
little
teson
was
costly
to
build
and
maintain
on
one
night
the
french
lost
men
killed
and
wounded
in
it
but
it
was
very
effective
the
original
breach
was
much
enlarged
and
the
old
wall
behind
it
was
reduced
to
ruins
meanwhile
a
mortar
battery
placed
in
the
conquered
suburb
played
upon
the
parts
of
the
town
which
had
hitherto
escaped
bombardment
and
reduced
many
streets
to
ashes
the
position
of
the
garrison
was
unsatisfactory
and
herrasti
sent
out
several
emissaries
to
beg
wellington
to
help
him
ere
it
was
too
late
most
of
these
adventurers
were
captured
by
the
french
but
at
least
two
reached
the
british
commander
who
had
recently
come
up
to
the
front
to
observe
for
himself
the
state
of
the
enemy
s
forces
he
found
them
too
strong
to
be
meddled
with
and
sent
back
a
letter
stating
that
he
was
ready
to
move
if
he
saw
any
chance
of
success
but
that
at
present
none
such
was
visible
he
then
retired
after
leaving
craufurd
two
squadrons
of
the
light
dragoons
to
strengthen
his
thin
outpost
line
herrasti
though
much
dispirited
by
wellington
s
reply
continued
to
make
a
vigorous
defence
but
the
town
was
now
mostly
in
ruins
and
the
breach
gaped
wide
belmas
iii

see
s
pp
and
on
july
masséna
who
had
again
come
up
to
visit
the
siege
obtained
intelligence
that
wellington
had
been
with
the
light
division
at
gallegos
and
determined
to
push
back
the
british
outposts
in
order
to
discover
whether
the
front
line
of
his
enemy
had
been
strengthened
by
any
troops
from
portugal
it
seemed
to
him
likely
enough
that
the
british
general
might
have
massed
his
army
for
a
bold
stroke
at
the
besiegers
now
that
the
strength
of
ciudad
rodrigo
was
running
low
accordingly
croix
s
division
of
dragoons
supported
by
a
brigade
of
junot
s
infantry
crossed
the
azava
brook
and
drove
in
craufurd
s
cavalry
pickets
they
retired
skirmishing
vigorously
all
the
way
to
gallegos
where
the
five
infantry
battalions
of
the
light
division
had
concentrated
craufurd
having
strict
orders
from
his
chief
that
he
was
not
to
fight
fell
back
on
fort
concepcion
the
work
on
the
spanish
frontier
half
way
to
almeida
thereupon
the
french
retired
having
obtained
the
information
that
they
wanted
viz
that
craufurd
had
not
been
reinforced
by
any
considerable
body
of
troops
from
the
rear
the
light
division
had
manœuvred
with
its
customary
intelligence
and
alertness
all
day
its
flanks
were
being
continually
turned
by
horsemen
in
overpowering
numbers
but
it
beat
them
off
with
ease
and
lost
only
five
men
wounded
while
falling
back
across
ten
miles
of
absolutely
open
country
the
french
lost
five
officers
and
over
twenty
men
mostly
in
combats
with
the
german
hussars
who
surpassed
themselves
on
this
day
and
repeatedly
charged
the
heads
of
the
hostile
columns
on
favourable
occasions
for
the
future
craufurd
kept
behind
the
dos
casas
while
the
french
took
up
his
old
line
on
the
azava
this
move
made
any
attempt
to
help
ciudad
rodrigo
a
harder
business
than
before
since
the
british
outposts
were
now
fifteen
instead
of
only
six
miles
from
the
town
an
attempt
to
storm
by
surprise
the
french
camps
on
the
near
side
of
the
place
was
for
the
future
impossible
belmas

the
conduct
of
the
hussars
see
beamish
s
pp
martinien
s
lists
show
that
the
french
dragoons
lost
one
the
three
and
the
one
officer
on
this
day
warned
by
this
activity
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
wellington
again
reinforced
craufurd
s
cavalry
giving
him
three
squadrons
of
the
light
dragoons
so
that
the
light
division
had
now
some
horse
to
watch
its
long
and
much
exposed
front
but
the
french
advance
now
halted
again
for
a
full
fortnight
the
demonstration
of
july
having
had
no
other
purpose
than
that
of
ascertaining
the
strength
of
the
british
observing
force
behind
the
azava
on
the
four
days
that
followed
craufurd
s
retreat
the
french
batteries
were
thundering
against
the
northern
angle
of
ciudad
rodrigo
and
had
reduced
it
to
one
vast
breach
more
than
feet
broad
but
ney
more
sparing
of
life
than
was
his
wont
refused
to
order
an
assault
till
the
whole
of
the
spanish
artillery
on
the
neighbouring
front
should
have
been
silenced
and
till
the
engineers
should
have
worked
up
to
and
blown
in
the
counterscarp
this
last
preliminary
was
accomplished
on
the
night
of
the
eighth
when
a
mine
containing
lb
of
powder
was
exploded
with
success
just
outside
the
counterscarp
and
cast
down
a
vast
amount
of
earth
into
the
ditch
so
that
there
was
now
an
almost
level
road
from
the
advanced
trenches
to
the
foot
of
the
inner
wall
the
garrison
repeatedly
built
up
the
lip
of
the
breach
with
palisades
and
sandbags
under
a
heavy
fire
and
at
great
expense
of
life
but
their
flimsy
repairs
were
swept
away
again
and
again
by
the
batteries
on
the
little
teson
and
all
their
guns
on
this
front
of
the
walls
were
gradually
disabled
or
destroyed
early
on
the
afternoon
of
july
the
engineers
informed
the
marshal
that
ciudad
rodrigo
was
untenable
and
that
a
storm
could
not
fail
of
success
three
battalions
composed
of
picked
voltigeur
and
grenadier
companies
were
brought
up
to
the
advanced
trenches
under
the
marshal
s
personal
superintendence
before
letting
them
loose
on
the
broad
acclivity
of
rubble
before
them
ney
asked
for
three
volunteers
who
would
take
the
desperate
risk
of
climbing
up
to
the
crest
of
the
breach
to
see
if
it
were
retrenched
behind
a
corporal
and
two
privates
made
this
daring
venture
ran
lightly
up
to
the
summit
fired
their
muskets
into
the
town
and
descended
unhurt
under
a
scattering
fire
from
the
few
spaniards
who
were
still
holding
on
to
the
ruins
on
receiving
their
assurance
that
nothing
was
to
be
feared
ney
ordered
the
storming
battalions
to
move
out
of
the
trenches
but
ere
they
had
started
an
officer
with
a
white
flag
appeared
on
the
breach
and
descended
to
inform
the
marshal
that
the
governor
was
prepared
to
capitulate
finding
that
ney
was
immediately
below
herrasti
came
out
in
person
with
his
staff
a
few
minutes
later
and
settled
the
whole
matter
in
a
short
conversation
ney
congratulated
the
veteran
on
his
handsome
defence
returned
him
his
sword
and
told
him
that
he
should
have
all
the
honours
of
war
accordingly
the
garrison
marched
out
next
morning
about
strong
laid
down
its
arms
below
the
glacis
and
was
marched
off
to
bayonne
the
spaniards
had
lost
killed
and
wounded
just
a
quarter
of
their
force
in
their
highly
honourable
resistance
they
had
only
a
few
days
provisions
left
and
though
their
munitions
were
by
no
means
exhausted
they
would
have
been
forced
to
yield
for
want
of
food
even
if
the
storm
had
failed
which
was
absolutely
impossible
the
french
captured
guns
most
of
them
in
bad
order
or
disabled
and
muskets
not
a
house
or
church
in
the
place
was
intact
and
a
large
majority
were
roofless
or
levelled
to
the
ground
there
was
no
use
whatever
in
protracting
the
resistance
and
it
is
clear
that
herrasti
had
done
all
that
a
good
officer
could
in
his
dispatch
to
the
junta
he
spoke
somewhat
bitterly
of
the
fact
that
wellington
had
made
no
effort
to
relieve
the
place
showing
feeling
natural
enough
under
the
circumstances
martin
la
carrera
who
had
been
commanding
the
spanish
division
that
lay
in
the
mountains
south
of
the
town
expressed
his
wrath
still
more
bitterly
and
marched
off
to
estremadura
in
high
dudgeon
the
moment
that
the
news
of
the
surrender
reached
him
the
french
had
been
forced
to
much
greater
exertions
in
the
siege
of
rodrigo
than
they
had
expected
when
they
first
sat
down
before
its
walls
their
artillery
had
thrown
shells
and
round
shot
into
the
place
which
almost
exhausted
their
store
of
munitions
only
rounds
for
each
of
their
fifty
guns
having
been
provided
they
had
lost
killed
and
over
wounded
mainly
in
the
costly
work
of
pushing
forward
the
approaches
towards
the
wall
before
the
spanish
artillery
fire
had
been
silenced
professional
critics
attributed
the
delays
and
losses
of
the
siege
entirely
to
the
fact
that
the
engineers
believed
when
they
first
planned
their
works
that
the
enemy
would
surrender
the
moment
that
a
breach
had
been
made
an
idea
which
had
never
entered
into
herrasti
s
head
masséna
showed
his
when
all
was
over
by
sending
the
civilian
members
of
the
junta
as
prisoners
to
france
and
imposing
a
fine
of
francs
on
the
miserable
ruined
town
it
is
surprising
to
learn
that
he
actually
succeeded
in
extracting
half
that
sum
from
the
homeless
and
starving
population
see
the
criticisms
in
belmas
iii
compare
the
views
of
the
artilleryman
hulot
pages
of
his
autobiography
on
the
day
that
the
garrison
of
rodrigo
marched
out
july
craufurd
had
suffered
a
misadventure
seeing
that
the
french
foragers
were
busy
in
the
villages
between
the
azava
and
the
dos
casas
he
had
resolved
to
make
an
attempt
to
surprise
some
of
their
bands
and
went
out
from
fort
concepcion
with
six
squadrons
of
cavalry
six
companies
of
the
rifles
and
the
a
battalion
of
caçadores
and
two
guns
coming
suddenly
upon
the
french
covering
party
near
the
village
of
barquilla
he
ordered
his
cavalry
to
pursue
them
the
enemy
consisting
of
two
troops
of
dragoons
and
men
of
the
regiment
from
junot
s
corps
began
a
hasty
retreat
towards
their
lines
thereupon
craufurd
bade
his
leading
squadrons
one
of
the
german
hussars
and
one
of
the
to
charge
they
did
so
falling
upon
the
infantry
who
halted
and
formed
square
in
a
to
receive
them
the
charge
made
by
men
who
had
been
galloping
for
a
mile
and
had
been
much
disordered
by
passing
some
enclosures
failed
the
troopers
opening
out
to
right
and
left
under
the
fire
of
the
square
swept
on
and
chased
the
french
cavalry
who
were
making
off
to
the
flank
they
followed
them
for
some
distance
finally
overtaking
them
and
making
two
officers
and
men
prisoners
meanwhile
craufurd
called
up
the
next
squadron
from
the
road
the
leading
one
of
the
light
dragoons
and
sent
it
in
against
the
little
square
headed
by
their
colonel
talbot
the
men
of
the
charged
home
but
were
unable
to
break
the
french
who
stood
firm
and
waited
till
the
horses
heads
were
within
ten
paces
of
their
bayonets
before
firing
talbot
and
seven
of
his
men
fell
dead
and
some
dozen
more
were
disabled
before
another
squadron
could
come
up
the
french
slipped
off
into
the
enclosures
of
the
village
of
cismeiro
and
got
away
it
was
said
that
no
effort
was
made
to
stop
them
because
two
outlying
squadrons
of
british
cavalry
which
had
ridden
in
towards
the
sound
of
the
firing
were
mistaken
for
a
large
body
of
french
horse
coming
up
to
the
rescue
of
the
infantry
both
craufurd
and
the
british
cavalry
were
much
criticized
over
this
affair
but
it
was
in
truth
nothing
more
than
an
example
of
the
general
rule
that
horsemen
could
not
break
steady
infantry
properly
formed
in
square
during
the
peninsular
war
the
instances
to
the
contrary
are
few
it
was
said
at
the
time
that
craufurd
might
have
used
his
leading
squadrons
to
detain
and
harass
the
french
till
his
guns
or
his
infantry
which
were
a
mile
to
the
rear
could
be
brought
up
this
may
have
been
so
but
criticism
after
the
event
is
easy
and
if
the
guns
or
the
riflemen
had
come
up
ten
minutes
late
and
the
french
infantry
had
been
allowed
to
go
off
uncharged
the
general
would
have
been
blamed
still
more
he
lost
in
all
an
officer
and
eight
men
killed
and
wounded
while
he
took
prisoners
but
the
defeat
rankled
and
caused
so
much
unpleasant
feeling
that
wellington
went
out
of
his
way
to
send
for
and
rebuke
officers

combat
of
the

siege
of
almeida
on
july
the
french
had
entered
ciudad
rodrigo
but
ten
days
more
elapsed
before
they
made
any
further
advance
masséna
who
had
returned
to
the
front
was
resolved
to
follow
his
master
s
orders
and
to
act
it
was
clearly
incumbent
on
him
to
begin
the
siege
of
almeida
as
soon
as
possible
and
as
that
place
is
only
miles
from
ciudad
rodrigo
one
long
march
would
have
placed
him
before
its
walls
but
since
he
had
only
a
few
thousand
rounds
of
ammunition
left
for
his
heavy
guns
he
refused
to
move
on
till
all
the
available
reserves
were
on
their
way
from
salamanca
to
the
front
and
requisition
for
a
further
supply
had
been
sent
to
bayonne
he
had
also
to
do
his
best
to
scrape
together
more
food
since
the
magazines
that
ney
had
collected
were
nearly
exhausted
when
rodrigo
fell
moreover
draught
animals
had
died
during
the
late
siege
and
it
was
necessary
to
replace
them
before
the
great
park
could
move
forward
on
july
however
some
convoys
having
come
up
from
salamanca
masséna
directed
ney
to
advance
with
the
corps
and
to
drive
craufurd
back
on
to
almeida
the
main
point
that
he
was
directed
to
ascertain
on
this
day
was
whether
the
english
intended
to
make
a
stand
at
fort
concepcion
the
isolated
spanish
work
which
faces
almeida
on
the
frontier
beyond
the
turones
this
was
a
solid
fort
covering
the
bridge
where
the
passes
the
river
it
had
lately
been
repaired
and
could
have
resisted
a
bombardment
for
some
days
but
it
would
have
required
a
garrison
of
men
and
since
it
lies
in
the
midst
of
the
plain
there
would
be
little
chance
of
relieving
it
if
once
it
were
surrounded
wellington
therefore
gave
orders
that
it
should
be
blown
up
whenever
the
french
should
advance
in
force
toward
almeida
and
that
craufurd
should
make
no
attempt
to
defend
the
line
of
the
turones
and
should
send
back
his
infantry
to
junca
a
village
about
a
mile
outside
the
gates
of
almeida
keeping
his
cavalry
only
to
the
front
on
the
ney
advanced
with
the
whole
of
loison
s
division
and
treillard
s
cavalry
brigade
thereupon
craufurd
with
some
reluctance
retired
and
blew
up
fort
concepcion
as
he
went
the
french
advanced
skirmishing
with
the
light
dragoons
and
the
german
hussars
but
finally
halted
at
val
de
mula
four
miles
from
almeida
craufurd
established
himself
at
junca
only
three
miles
from
the
enemy
s
line
of
pickets
on
the
next
evening
he
received
a
strong
suggestion
if
not
quite
an
order
from
his
chief
to
send
his
infantry
across
the
coa

under
these
circumstances
if
you
are

it
not

that
you
should
come
to

side
of

infantry

least
the
tentative
form
of
the
note
well
marks
the
confidence
that
the
was
wont
to
place
in
his
subordinate
s
judgement
this
time
that
confidence
was
somewhat
misplaced
for
craufurd
tarried
two
days
longer
by
the
glacis
of
almeida
and
thereby
risked
a
disaster

wellington
to
craufurd
from
alverca
july
it
must
be
remembered
that
almeida
is
not
on
the
coa
but
two
miles
from
it
and
that
its
guns
therefore
did
not
cover
the
one
bridge
over
which
craufurd
could
make
his
retreat
indeed
that
bridge
and
the
river
also
are
invisible
from
almeida
the
fortress
is
slightly
raised
above
the
level
of
the
rolling
plain
which
extends
as
far
as
ciudad
rodrigo
the
river
flows
in
a
deep
bed
so
much
below
the
plateau
as
to
be
lost
to
sight
its
ravine
is
a
sort
of
cañon
which
marks
the
end
of
the
plains
of
leon
it
has
often
been
remarked
that
almeida
s
value
would
have
been
doubled
if
only
it
had
been
on
the
near
side
of
the
coa
and
commanded
its
bridge
but
portuguese
kings
had
built
and
rebuilt
the
old
fortress
on
its
original
site
with
no
regard
for
strategy
craufurd
then
should
have
remembered
that
if
he
were
suddenly
attacked
in
his
camp
outside
the
gates
he
risked
being
thrown
back
into
the
town
the
last
thing
he
would
wish
or
being
hustled
down
to
the
bridge
and
forced
to
pass
his
division
across
it
in
dangerous
haste
but
he
had
so
often
challenged
held
back
and
evaded
ney
s
and
junot
s
advanced
guards
that
he
evidently
considered
that
he
was
taking
no
very
serious
risk
in
staying
where
he
was
he
was
moreover
discharging
a
valuable
function
by
keeping
almeida
from
being
invested
as
stores
and
munitions
were
still
being
poured
into
the
place
the
only
peril
was
that
he
might
be
attacked
both
without
warning
and
by
overwhelming
superiority
of
numbers
with
the
defile
at
his
back
neither
of
these
misadventures
had
yet
happened
to
him
during
the
four
and
a
half
months
while
he
had
been
defying
the
and
the
corps
along
the
banks
of
the
agueda
the
french
had
never
assailed
him
with
much
more
than
a
division
nor
had
they
ever
pressed
on
him
with
headlong
speed
so
as
to
prevent
an
orderly
retreat
properly
covered
by
a
moderate
rearguard
now
however
ney
untrammelled
by
any
other
operation
had
his
whole
corps
concentrated
behind
val
de
mula
and
having
learnt
of
the
defile
that
lay
in
craufurd
s
rear
thought
that
he
might
be
hurled
into
it
and
crushed
or
caught
before
dawn
he
arrayed
his
whole
men
in
one
broad
and
deep
column
two
cavalry
brigades
lamotte
s
hussars
and
chasseurs
and
gardanne
s
and

were
in
front
then
came
the
thirteen
battalions
of
loison
s
division
in
a
line
of
columns
behind
them
was
mermet
with
eleven
battalions
more
while
three
regiments
of
marchand
s
division
the
fourth
was
garrisoning
ciudad
rodrigo
formed
the
reserve
in
a
grey
morning
following
a
night
of
bitter
rain
the
french
horsemen
rode
at
the
british
cavalry
pickets
and
sent
them
flying
across
the
three
miles
of
rolling
ground
that
lay
in
front
of
the
light
division
on
hearing
the
fire
of
the
carbines
craufurd
s
men
turned
out
with
their
accustomed
celerity
and
in
a
very
short
space
were
aligned
to
the
right
of
almeida
with
their
flank
only
yards
from
the
glacis
and
their
front
covered
by
a
series
of
high
stone
walls
bounding
suburban
fields
there
would
have
been
just
enough
time
to
get
cavalry
guns
and
impedimenta
across
the
bridge
of
the
coa
if
the
general
had
started
off
at
once
but
not
realizing
the
fearful
strength
that
lay
behind
the
french
cavalry
advance
he
resolved
to
treat
himself
to
a
rearguard
action
and
not
to
go
till
he
was
pushed
on
a
survey
of
the
ground
it
is
easy
to
understand
the
temptation
for
it
would
be
hard
to
find
a
prettier
battlefield
for
a
detaining
force
if
only
the
enemy
were
in
no
more
than
moderate
strength
a
long
spur
runs
down
from
the
high
plateau
on
which
almeida
stands
to
the
coa
successive
points
of
it
can
be
held
one
after
the
other
and
it
is
crossed
by
many
stone
walls
giving
good
cover
for
skirmishers
with
his
left
covered
by
the
fire
of
the
fortress
and
his
right
refused
and
trending
back
towards
the
river
craufurd
waited
to
be
attacked
intending
to
give
the
leading
french
brigade
a
lesson
there
was
a
delay
of
more
than
an
hour
before
the
french
infantry
was
up
but
when
the
assault
came
it
was
overwhelming
craufurd
s
line
of
three
british
and
two
portuguese
battalions
was
suddenly
assaulted
by
loison
s
thirteen
who
came
on
at
the
de
yelling
with
drums
beating
and
the
officers
like
mountebanks
running
ahead
with
their
hats
on
their
swords
capering
like
madmen
and
crying
as
they
turned
to
wave
on
their
men
allons
enfants

avançera
napoléon
le

the
rolling
fire
of
the
british
stopped
the
first
rush
when
suddenly
a
french
cavalry
regiment
the
hussars
charged
across
the
interval
between
craufurd
s
left
and
the
walls
of
almeida
braving
the
fire
of
the
ramparts
in
the
most
gallant
style
some
fell
but
the
gunners
were
flurried
at
this
unexpected
development
and
fired
wildly
so
that
the
hussars
swept
down
unchecked
on
the
extreme
flank
of
the
light
division
where
a
company
of
the
rifles
was
annihilated
and
began
riding
along
the
rear
of
the
line
and
rolling
it
up
they
were
luckily
checked
for
a
moment
by
a
stone
wall
but
craufurd
saw
that
he
must
retreat
at
once
since
he
was
turned
on
the
side
where
he
had
thought
that
he
was
safest
the
cavalry
and
guns
were
ordered
to
gallop
for
the
bridge
the
caçadores
to
follow
them
and
the
rest
of
the
infantry
to
fall
back
in
échelon
from
the
left
defending
each
enclosure
and
fold
of
the
hillside
as
long
as
possible
but
it
is
hard
to
make
an
orderly
retreat
when
a
foe
with
twofold
strength
in
his
fighting
line
is
pressing
hard
moreover
the
road
to
the
bridge
has
an
unfortunate
peculiarity
instead
of
making
straight
for
its
goal
it
overshoots
it
in
order
to
descend
the
slope
at
an
easy
point
and
then
comes
back
along
the
river
bank
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
the
cavalry
and
guns
forced
to
keep
to
the
road
because
the
hillside
was
too
steep
for
them
had
to
cover
two
sides
of
a
triangle
with
a
sharp
turn
at
the
apex
which
delayed
them
terribly
to
add
to
the
trouble
an
artillery
caisson
was
upset
at
a
sharp
turn
and
took
much
trouble
to
right
and
send
forward
thus
it
chanced
that
the
covering
infantry
were
driven
down
close
to
the
bridge
before
the
caçadores
and
the
last
of
the
guns
had
crossed
the
river
the
retreat
of
the
three
british
battalions
had
been
most
perilous
at
one
moment
a
wing
of
the
found
themselves
checked
by
a
vineyard
wall
ten
feet
high
while
the
french
were
pressing
hard
on
their
rear
they
only
escaped
by
shoving
a
long
part
of
it
over
by
sheer
strength
fortunately
like
all
other
walls
in
this
part
of
portugal
it
was
made
of
dry
flat
stones
without
mortar
finally
the
the
rifles
and
part
of
the
were
massed
on
a
long
knoll
covered
with
which
lies
above
the
bridge
and
completely
masks
it
against
an
attack
from
above
while
they
held
firm
craufurd
ranged
the
guns
and
the
caçadores
on
the
slopes
upon
the
other
side
so
as
to
command
the
passage
when
the
rest
of
the
troops
should
have
to
cross
he
then
began
to
withdraw
the
and
part
of
that
battalion
had
already
crossed
the
water
when
five
companies
of
the
which
had
occupied
the
extreme
right
wing
of
the
division
were
seen
hastening
along
the
river
bank
some
way
above
the
bridge
they
had
held
out
a
little
too
long
on
the
slopes
above
and
seemed
likely
to
be
cut
off
for
the
french
noting
their
position
made
a
vigorous
effort
and
carried
the
knoll
which
protected
their
line
of
retreat
to
the
point
of
passage
this
was
a
desperate
crisis
but
such
was
the
splendid
courage
and
initiative
of
the
regimental
officers
of
the
light
division
that
the
disaster
was
averted
at
one
point
beckwith
colonel
of
the
rifles
at
another
major
mcleod
of
the
called
on
the
disordered
mass
of
men
who
had
been
driven
back
to
the
bridge
head
to
charge
again
and
save
the
the
soldiers
grasped
the
situation
cheered
and
followed
they
recaptured
the
knoll
that
they
had
just
lost
and
held
it
for
ten
minutes
more
gaining
time
for
the
companies
of
the
to
pass
behind
and
cross
the
bridge
no
one
present
wrote
an
can
fail
to
remember
the
gallantry
of
major
mcleod
how
either
he
or
his
horse
escaped
being
blown
to
atoms
while
in
this
daring
manner
he
charged
on
horseback
at
the
head
of
some
skirmishers
of
the
and
mixed
together
and
headed
them
in
making
a
dash
at
the
line
of
french
infantry
whom
we
dislodged
i
am
at
a
loss
to
imagine
it
was
one
of
those
extraordinary
escapes
which
tend
to
implant
in
the
mind
some
faith
in
the
doctrine
of
fatality
the
on

left
the
two
caçador
battalions
in
the
centre

on
the
right
while
the
rifles
were
partly
dispersed
along
the
front
partly
with
the
simmons

of
a
british
of
this
o
hare
s
company
of
the
strong
an
officer
and
eleven
men
were
killed
or
wounded
and
were
taken
prisoners
leach
s
pp
the
moment
that
the
were
safe
the
troops
on
the
knoll
evacuated
it
and
crossed
the
bridge
behind
them
at
full
speed
while
the
french
reoccupied
the
wooded
eminence
if
ney
had
been
wise
he
would
have
stopped
at
this
moment
and
have
contented
himself
with
having
driven
in
the
light
division
with
a
loss
of
men
while
his
own
troops
had
suffered
comparatively
little
but
carried
away
by
the
excitement
of
victory
he
resolved
to
storm
the
bridge
thinking
that
the
british
troops
were
too
much
shaken
and
disordered
to
make
another
stand
even
in
a
strong
position
there
were
plenty
of
examples
in
recent
french
military
history
from
lodi
to
ebersberg
where
passages
had
been
forced
under
difficulties
as
great
accordingly
he
ordered
the
the
leading
regiment
of
loison
s
division
to
push
on
and
cross
the
river
this
was
a
dire
mistake
craufurd
already
had
the
caçadores
in
position
behind
stone
walls
a
little
above
the
bridge
and
ross
s
guns
placed
across
the
road
so
as
to
sweep
it
from
end
to
end
the
british
battalions
were
no
sooner
across
the
river
than
they
began
to
string
themselves
out
behind
the
rocks
and
walls
which
lie
in
a
sort
of
small
amphitheatre
on
the
slope
commanding
the
passage
the
bridge
a
structure
seventy
yards
long
crosses
the
coa
diagonally
at
a
point
where
it
is
narrowed
down
between
rocks
and
flows
very
fiercely
it
was
flooded
at
this
moment
from
the
rain
of
the
previous
night
and
was
swelling
still
for
a
tropical
storm
had
just
begun
and
raged
at
intervals
throughout
the
afternoon
the
cavalry
useless
at
the
bridge
was
sent
to
watch
some
difficult
fords
near
alveirenos
the
french
ordered
by
the
marshal
to
carry
the
bridge
formed
its
grenadiers
on
the
knoll
to
lead
the
column
and
then
charged
at
the
passage
but
the
leading
company
was
mown
down
before
it
had
got
half
way
across
by
a
concentrated
musketry
salvo
from
the
hillside
in
front
and
the
enfilading
fire
of
the
guns
from
the
right
the
column
broke
and
the
men
recoiled
and
dispersed
among
the
rocks
and
trees
by
the
bank
from
whence
they
opened
a
fierce
but
ineffective
fire
upon
the
british
battalions
ney
who
had
now
lost
his
temper
ordered
up
a
d
of
light
infantry
which
had
distinguished
itself
at
the
siege
of
ciudad
rodrigo
and
told
his
aide
de
camp
sprünglin
to
take
the
command
and
cross
at
all
costs
there
ensued
a
most
gallant
effort
and
a
hideous
butchery
the
chasseurs
flung
themselves
at
the
bridge
and
pushed
on
till
it
was
absolutely
blocked
by
the
bodies
of
the
killed
and
the
wounded
and
till
they
themselves
had
been
almost
literally
exterminated
for
out
of
a
battalion
of
little
more
than
men
were
killed
and
wounded
in
less
than
ten
minutes
a
few
survivors
actually
crossed
the
bridge
and
threw
themselves
down
among
the
rocks
at
its
western
end
where
they
took
shelter
from
the
british
fire
in
a
little
corner
of
dead
ground
but
could
of
course
make
no
further
attempt
to
advance
the
de
la
formed
of
picked
marksmen
from
all
the
regiments
of
the
corps
that
ney
himself
was
the
person
responsible
for
this
mad
adventure
seems
proved
by
the
journal
of
sprünglin
who
writes
à
midi
je
reçus
de

the
bridge
was
emporté
in
any
other
sense
than
that
a
score
or
so
of
survivors
got
to
the
other
side
and
then
returned
is
of
course
untrue
sprünglin
ney
irritated
beyond
measure
now
bade
a
mounted
officer
sound
for
a
ford
at
a
spot
above
the
bridge
where
the
river
spreads
out
into
a
broad
reach
but
horse
and
man
were
killed
by
a
volley
from
the
british
side
and
floated
down
the
swollen
stream
finding
the
river
impracticable
the
marshal
again
ordered
the
to
go
forward
this
third
attack
delivered
without
the
dash
and
determination
of
the
first
two
was
beaten
back
with
little
trouble
the
firing
then
died
down
and
during
one
of
the
fierce
rainstorms
of
the
late
afternoon
the
few
chasseurs
who
had
crossed
the
bridge
ran
back
and
escaped
to
their
own
bank
craufurd
held
the
position
that
he
had
occupied
till
midnight
and
then
retired
on
pinhel
he
had
lost
men
only
and
was
fortunate
therein
for
half
his
division
might
have
been
destroyed
if
the
officers
had
shown
less
intelligence
and
the
men
less
pluck
the
french
had
casualties
of
them
in
the
mad
attempt
to
force
the
bridge
in
which
the
colonel
of
the
and
fifteen
of
his
officers
had
fallen
and
the
battalion
of
chasseurs
had
been
practically
exterminated
ney
forwarded
an
honest
chronicle
of
the
day
s
doings
to
his
chief
which
masséna
wrote
up
and
sent
to
the
emperor
turned
into
a
work
of
fancy
in
which
he
declared
that
he
had
destroyed
of
craufurd
s
men
whom
he
estimated
at
horse
and
infantry
double
their
real
strength
taken
prisoners
a
colour
and
two
guns
making
no
mention
of
the
complete
check
that
loison
s
division
had
suffered
at
the
bridge
he
stated
that
the
imperial
troops
have
shown
once
again
this
day
that
there
is
no
position
which
can
resist
their
he
added
foolish
gossip
their
chief
portuguese
courier
has
been
captured
with
all
his
dispatches
in
which
are
several
of
the
and
instant
which
declare
that
the
english
army
is
in
complete
rout
that
its
deplorable
state
can
not
be
exaggerated
that
the
english
have
never
been
in
such
a
hot
corner
that
they
have
lost
sixty
officers
of
whom
they
buried
on
the
battlefield
about
dead
and
wounded
apparently
these
dispatches
are
an
invention
of
masséna
s
own
it
is
incredible
that
any
british
officer
can
have
written
such
stuff
after
a
combat
of
which
every
man
present
was
particularly
proud
and
in
which
the
losses
had
been
incredibly
small
considering
the
risks
that
had
been
run
four
officers
not
had
been
killed
and
one
made
prisoner
instead
of
being
in
complete
rout
the
light
division
had
retired
at
leisure
and
unmolested
without
leaving
even
a
wounded
man
or
a
single
cart
behind
for
an
interesting
description
of
this
incident
see
george
napier
s
autobiography
killed
wounded
missing
see
tables
in
appendix
martinien
s
invaluable
lists
show
officers
killed
and
wounded
which
at
the
normal
rate
of
men
per
officer
exactly
corresponds
to
the
actual
loss
of
killed
and
wounded
koch
vii
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
in
the
draft
of
masséna
s
dispatch
in
the
du
ministère
de

we
actually
catch
him
in
the
act
of
falsifying

the

for
the
french
loss
is
scratched
out
and
inserted

dispatch
was

has
replaced
the
genuine

in
his
reprint
of
masséna
s
dispatch
though
both
the
draft
in
the
and
the
original
publication
in
the
give
the
falsifications
masséna
says
nought
of
the
check
at
the
bridge
though
ney
honestly
wrote

as
to
the
guns
captured
it
was
perfectly
true
that
some
cannon
were
taken
that
day
but
not
in
fighting
nor
from
craufurd
the
governor
of
almeida
was
mounting
two
small
guns
on
a
windmill
some
way
outside
the
glacis
they
had
not
been
got
up
to
their
position
but
were
lying
below
removed
from
their
carriages
in
order
to
be
slung
up
more
easily
on
to
the
roof
the
mill
was
abandoned
when
ney
came
up
and
the
dismounted
cannon
fell
into
his
hands
he
said
not
a
word
of
them
any
more
than
he
did
of
the
imaginary
flag
alleged
by
masséna
to
have
been
captured
but
the
prince
of
essling
brought
in
both
to
please
the
imperial
palate
which
yearned
for
british
flags
and
guns
his
dispatch
published
some
weeks
later
in
the
came
into
craufurd
s
hands
in
november
and
provoked
him
to
write
a
vindication
of
his
conduct
and
a
contradiction
of
the
false
assertions
contained
in
marshal
masséna
s
report
of
an
action
which
was
not
only
highly
honourable
to
the
light
division
but
positively
terminated
in
its
favour
notwithstanding
the
extraordinary
disparity
of
numbers
for
a
corps
of
men
performed
in
the
face
of
an
army
of
one
of
the
most
difficult
operations
of
war
a
retreat
from
a
broken
and
extensive
position
over
one
narrow
defile
and
defended
during
the
whole
day
the
first
defensible
position
that
was
to
be
found
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
place
where
the
action
for
the
whole
letter
see
alex
craufurd
s
of
pp
wellington
was
justly
displeased
with
craufurd
for
accepting
this
wholly
unnecessary
combat
if
the
light
division
had
been
withdrawn
behind
the
coa
on
the
as
he
had
advised
no
danger
would
have
been
incurred
and
the
bridge
might
have
been
defended
without
the
preliminary
retreat
to
the
water
s
edge
yet
so
great
was
the
confidence
in
which
craufurd
was
held
by
wellington
that
their
correspondence
shows
no
break
of
cordiality
or
tension
of
relations
during
the
ensuing
days
though
unofficially
the
divisional
general
was
aware
that
the
had
disapproved
his
action
and
felt
the
blame
that
was
unspoken
in
the
keenest
fashion
there
was
another
british
general
involved
in
a
serious
degree
of
culpability
on
the
this
was
picton
who
hearing
at
his
post
of
pinhel
the
firing
in
the
morning
rode
up
to
the
bridge
of
the
coa
there
he
met
craufurd
who
was
just
preparing
to
resist
ney
s
attempt
to
cross
the
river
picton
was
asked
to
bring
up
the
division
in
support
which
could
have
been
done
in
less
than
three
hours
but
roughly
refused
saying
apparently
that
craufurd
might
get
out
of
his
own
scrape
the
generals
parted
after
an
exchange
of
some
hard
words
and
picton
rode
back
to
order
his
division
to
get
ready
to
retreat
having
committed
one
of
the
greatest
military
sins
that
of
refusing
to
support
a
comrade
in
the
moment
of
danger
because
he
did
not
choose
to
compromise
his
own
troops
see
the
letter
to
craufurd
in
the
dated
july
and
his
letter
to
lord
liverpool
of
july
offers
indeed
excuses
for
craufurd
but
in
that
to
henry
wellesley
of
july
and
still
more
in
that
to
his
relative
pole
of
july
he
expresses
vexation
i
had
positively
forbidden
the
foolish
affairs
in
which
craufurd
involved
his
outposts
and
repeated
my
injunction
that
he
should
not
engage
in
an
affair
on
the
right
of
the
river
you
will
say
in
this
case
why
not
accuse
craufurd
i
answer
because
if
i
am
to
be
hanged
for
it
i
can
not
accuse
a
man
who
i
believe
has
meant
well
and
whose
error
was
one
of
judgement
not
of
see
s
pp
this
interview
was
denied
by
robinson
in
his
of
i
on
the
mere
allegation
of
some
of
picton
s
staff
that
they
had
not
heard
of
it
or
been
present
at
it
but
the
evidence
of
william
campbell
craufurd
s
brought
forward
by
napier
at
robinson
s
challenge
is
conclusive
see
napier
vi
pp
for
the
fiery
looks
and
violent
rejoinders
witnessed
by
campbell
picton
had
been
specially
ordered
to
support
craufurd
if
necessary
see
pp
and
having
cleared
the
beyond
the
coa
by
pressing
back
the
light
division
and
having
ascertained
by
a
reconnaissance
that
picton
had
evacuated
pinhel
on
the
night
of
the
masséna
was
able
to
sit
down
to
besiege
almeida
at
his
leisure
the
investment
was
assigned
to
ney
and
the
corps
while
junot
and
the
corps
were
brought
up
from
the
agueda
and
placed
in
the
villages
behind
and
to
the
right
of
the
besieged
place
so
as
to
be
able
to
support
ney
at
a
few
hours
notice
the
extreme
steepness
of
the
banks
of
the
coa
during
its
whole
course
rendered
it
most
unlikely
that
wellington
would
attempt
the
relief
of
almeida
by
a
direct
advance
he
would
have
had
to
force
a
passage
and
the
coa
unlike
the
agueda
has
very
few
fords
its
only
two
bridges
that
opposite
almeida
and
that
higher
up
at
castello
bom
were
held
in
force
by
the
corps
the
siege
however
might
not
improbably
prove
long
almeida
was
in
far
better
repair
than
ciudad
rodrigo
and
had
less
defects
the
little
town
is
situated
on
the
culminating
knoll
of
an
undulating
plateau
a
very
slight
eminence
but
one
which
was
not
commanded
by
any
higher
ground
as
rodrigo
was
by
the
two
tesons
the
outline
of
the
place
is
almost
circular
and
exactly
fits
the
round
knoll
on
which
it
stands
it
has
six
bastions
with
and
a
covered
way
there
is
a
dry
ditch
cut
in
the
solid
rock
for
almeida
lies
on
a
bare
granite
plateau
with
only
two
or
three
feet
of
earth
covering
the
hard
stratum
below
it
was
well
armed
with
over
guns
forty
of
which
were
or
still
heavier
it
had
casemates
completely
proof
against
bomb
fire
and
large
enough
to
cover
the
whole
garrison
this
as
has
been
already
said
consisted
of
one
regular
regiment
the
of
the
line
over
strong
and
the
three
militia
regiments
of
arganil
trancoso
and
vizeu
in
all
some
infantry
with
a
squadron
of
the
cavalry
regiment
and
gunners
the
governor
was
william
cox
an
english
colonel
and
a
portuguese
brigadier
he
had
with
him
five
other
english
officers
all
the
rest
of
the
garrison
being
portuguese
there
was
an
ample
store
both
of
food
and
of
ammunition
which
wellington
had
been
pouring
in
ever
since
the
siege
of
ciudad
rodrigo
began
only
two
serious
defects
existed
in
the
place
the
first
was
that
its
glacis
was
too
low
and
left
exposed
an
unduly
large
portion
of
the
walls
the
second
a
far
worse
fault
was
that
the
grand
magazine
was
established
in
a
rather
flimsy
mediaeval
castle
in
the
centre
of
the
town
and
was
not
nearly
so
well
protected
as
could
have
been
desired
nevertheless
wellington
calculated
that
almeida
should
hold
out
at
least
as
long
as
ciudad
rodrigo
and
had
some
hope
that
its
siege
would
detain
masséna
so
much
that
the
autumn
rains
would
set
in
before
he
had
taken
the
place
in
which
case
the
invasion
of
portugal
would
assume
a
character
of
difficulty
which
it
was
far
from
presenting
in
august
or
september
this
came
from
the
extreme
hardness
of
the
soil
which
induced
the
builders
of
the
enceinte
to
put
less
earth
into
the
glacis
than
was
needed
since
it
had
to
be
scraped
up
and
carried
from
a
great
distance
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
coating
of
soil
all
around
is
so
thin
above
the
rock
for
some
days
after
the
investment
of
almeida
had
been
completed
the
corps
remained
quiescent
and
made
no
attempt
to
break
ground
in
front
of
the
place
ney
was
waiting
for
the
grand
park
and
the
train
which
had
now
started
in
detachments
from
ciudad
rodrigo
but
were
advancing
very
slowly
on
account
of
the
lack
of
draught
animals
for
a
moment
wellington
thought
it
possible
that
the
enemy
was
about
to
mask
almeida
and
to
advance
into
portugal
with
his
main
army
without
delay
this
hypothesis
received
some
support
from
the
facts
that
junot
had
moved
up
from
the
agueda
and
that
reynier
had
shown
the
head
of
a
column
beyond
the
pass
of
perales
this
last
appeared
a
most
significant
movement
for
if
the
corps
was
about
to
march
up
from
the
tagus
to
join
masséna
the
deduction
was
that
it
was
required
to
join
in
a
general
invasion
since
it
was
clear
that
it
was
not
needed
for
the
mere
siege
of
almeida
wellington
accordingly
wrote
to
urge
hill
to
keep
a
most
vigilant
eye
on
reynier
and
to
be
ready
to
move
up
to
the
mondego
the
moment
that
it
was
certain
that
his
opponent
had
passed
the
sierra
de
gata
and
linked
himself
to
the
main
french
army
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
as
yet
no
danger
from
reynier
the
advance
of
one
of
his
flanking
detachments
to
navas
frias
beyond
the
pass
of
perales
and
a
raid
made
upon
penamacor
on
july
and
upon
monsanto
on
august
by
another
were
pure
matters
of
foraging
and
reconnaissance
reynier
had
no
orders
to
move
up
his
whole
force
to
join
masséna
and
was
only
amusing
himself
by
demonstrations
his
actions
became
most
puzzling
to
wellington
when
a
few
days
later
he
called
back
all
the
troops
that
had
moved
northward
and
concentrated
his
force
at
zarza
la
mayor
on
the
road
to
castello
branco
so
as
to
threaten
once
more
to
invade
central
portugal
by
the
line
of
the
tagus
this
was
no
device
of
his
own
but
the
result
of
a
dispatch
from
masséna
dated
july
ordering
him
to
keep
more
to
the
south
for
the
present
to
threaten
abrantes
and
to
afford
hill
no
chance
of
joining
wellington
wellington
to
hill
alverca
july
there
is
not
the
smallest
appearance
of
the
enemy
s
intending
to
attack
almeida
and
i
conclude
that
as
soon
as
they
have
got
together
their
force
they
will
make
a
dash
at
us
and
endeavour
to
make
our
retreat
as
difficult
as
reynier
s
feints
meanwhile
had
given
hill
some
trouble
the
appearance
of
a
northward
move
on
the
part
of
his
adversary
had
caused
the
british
general
to
make
ready
for
a
parallel
march
on
fundão
and
guarda
so
as
to
connect
himself
with
his
chief
he
transferred
his
head
quarters
first
from
castello
branco
to
sarzedas
and
then
from
sarzedas
to
atalaya
at
the
foot
of
the
pass
that
leads
to
the
mondego
valley
intending
to
cross
the
mountains
the
moment
that
reynier
had
passed
over
the
perales
defiles
with
his
main
body
but
seeing
the
corps
unexpectedly
turning
back
and
concentrating
at
zarza
hill
also
retraced
his
steps
and
lay
at
sarzedas
again
from

guard
at

out

the

successful

by
a
demonstration
made
on
an

by

had
been

with

agueda
in
obedience
to

serras
collected
at

as
much
of

as
could
be
spared
from

duty
and
moved
forward
to
threaten
the
frontier

he
advanced
with
some
men
as
far
as
puebla

from

on

he
drove
out
a
small
spanish
force
under
general
taboada
the
weak
brigade
which
echevarria
had
formerly
commanded
silveira
immediately
collected
all
the
portuguese

of

at

and
prepared
to
defend
the

unexpectedly
turned
back

a

in

it
may
be
worth
while
to
note
as
a
proof
of
the
slight
hold
which
bonnet

serras
possessed
on
their
allotted

made
his

conquer

so
to
destroy
the
indefatigable
and
evasive
partisans
in
his
front
he
forced
his
way
across
the
narcea
and
the
navia
and
his
vanguard
had
reached
castropol
on
the
galician
border
upon
july
when
he
heard
to
his
disgust
that
the
enemy
had
slipped
behind
him
barcena
was
threatening
his
base
at
oviedo
while
porlier
s
band
carried
round
by

ships
had
landed
near

cut
the

these
clever
moves
brought

back
in

evacuated

called
up

it
is
impossible
to
give
a
full
account
of
them
here
but
necessary
to
mention
them
to
show
the
sisyphean
character
of

task

to
return
to
the
main
focus
of
the
war
in
the
north
on

ney
s
troops
having
at
last
received
the
and
a
good
supply
of
munitions
from
ciudad
rodrigo
and
salamanca
broke
ground
in
front
of
almeida
wellington
was
much
relieved
at
the
news
as
it
was
now
clear
that
masséna
was
about
to
besiege
the
place
and
not
to
mask
it
and
march
forward
into
portugal
the
front
which
the
engineers
of
the
corps
had
chosen
for
attack
was
that
facing
the
bastion
of
san
pedro
on
the
front
of
the
town
the
first
parallel
was
drawn
at
a
distance
of
only
yards
from
the
walls
it
was
found
very
difficult
to
complete
owing
to
the
shallowness
of
the
earth
and
had
to
be
built
with
gabions
and
sandbags
rather
than
to
be
excavated
in
the
rocky
subsoil
in
many
places
outcrops
of
stone
came
to
the
surface
and
had
actually
to
be
blasted
away
by
the
sappers
in
order
to
allow
of
a
trench
of
the
shallowest
sort
being
formed
it
was
clear
that
the
construction
of
approaches
towards
the
town
would
present
the
greatest
difficulties
since
there
was
little
earth
in
which
to
burrow
between
the
and
the
no
less
than
eleven
batteries
were
constructed
along
the
first
parallel
they
were
armed
with
more
than
fifty
heavy
guns
for
there
was
artillery
in
abundance
in
addition
to
the
old
many
of
the
spanish
guns
taken
in
ciudad
rodrigo
had
been
brought
forward
the
portuguese
kept
up
a
vigorous
but
not
very
destructive
fire
all
the
time
but
on
the
they
succeeded
in
preventing
the
commencement
of
a
second
parallel
driving
out
the
workmen
before
they
could
cover
themselves
in
the
stony
ground
at
six
o
clock
on
the
morning
of
the
august
the
batteries
were
all
completed
and
opened
fire
several
quarters
of
the
town
were
in
flames
before
the
afternoon
and
the
guns
on
the
three
bastions
attacked
were
unable
to
hold
their
own
against
the
converging
fire
directed
on
them
but
no
serious
damage
had
been
done
to
the
defences
and
the
governor
was
undismayed
at
seven
o
clock
in
the
evening
however
a
fearful
disaster
occurred
one
in
its
own
way
unparalleled
in
magnitude
during
the
whole
peninsular
war
the
door
of
the
great
magazine
in
the
castle
had
been
opened
in
order
to
allow
of
the
sending
out
of
a
convoy
of
powder
to
the
southern
ramparts
where
the
artillery
had
been
hard
at
work
all
day
a
leaky
barrel
was
handed
out
which
left
a
trail
of
powder
behind
it
along
the
ground
it
was
being
fixed
to
the
saddle
of
a
when
a
french
bomb
fell
in
the
courtyard
of
the
castle
in
bursting
the
bomb
chanced
to
ignite
the
train
the
spark
ran
along
it
and
exploded
another
barrel
at
the
door
of
the
magazine
which
was
still
open
this
mischance
fired
the
whole
store
and
in
two
seconds
the
castle
the
cathedral
at
its
side
and
the
whole
central
portion
of
the
town
had
been
blasted
out
of
existence
the
earth
trembled
wrote
a
french
and
we
saw
an
immense
whirlwind
of
fire
and
smoke
rise
from
the
middle
of
the
place
it
was
like
the
bursting
of
a
volcano
one
of
the
things
that
i
can
never
forget
after
years
enormous
blocks
of
stone
were
hurled
into
the
trenches
where
they
killed
and
wounded
some
of
our
men
guns
of
heavy
calibre
were
lifted
from
the
ramparts
and
hurled
down
far
outside
them
when
the
smoke
cleared
off
a
great
part
of
almeida
had
disappeared
and
the
rest
was
a
heap
of
débris
five
hundred
of
the
garrison
perished
including
nearly
every
man
of
the
two
hundred
artillerymen
who
were
serving
the
guns
on
the
front
of
attack
some
inhabitants
were
killed
but
not
many
for
the
majority
had
taken
refuge
in
the
casemates
when
the
bombardment
began
that
morning
it
was
the
unfortunate
soldiers
who
were
manning
the
walls
that
suffered

general

ran
to
the

and

portuguese
artillery
officer
loaded
and
fired
into
the
trenches
some
of
the
few
guns
on
the

which
were

he
turned
out
the
whole

and
kept
them
under
arms
that
night
lying
behind
the
walls
in
expectation
of
an
assault
which
never
came
the
morning
light
enabled
him
to
realize
the
full
extent
of
the
disaster
the
bastions
and
curtains
had
suffered
little
the
shell
so
to
speak
of
the
town
was
still
intact
and
the
casemates
had
stood
firm
but
everything
within
the
enceinte
was
wrecked
only
five
houses
in
the
place
had
kept
their
roofs
the
castle
was
a
deep
hole
like
the
crater
of
a
volcano
the
streets
were
absolutely
blocked
with
ruins
so
that
there
was
no
going
from
place
to
place
save
along
the
ramparts
there
were
still
men
under
arms
but
the
officer
commanding
the
artillery
reported
that
barrels
of
powder
and
a
few
hundred
rounds
in
the
small
on
the
ramparts
were
all
that
had
escaped
the
explosion
that
is
to
say
there
was
not
powder
in
the
place
to
keep
up
a
reply
for
one
day
to
the
batteries
of
the
besieger
the
infantry
had
cartridges
in
their
regimental
stores
rounds
per
man
but
that
was
of
no
use
for
the
heavy
guns
moreover
more
than
half
the
gunners
had
perished
in
the
disaster
of
the
previous
night
only
were
left
to
man
nearly
guns
that
were
still
serviceable
it
was
clear
that
almeida
was
doomed
since
it
could
not
defend
itself
without
powder
but
there
was
a
chance
that
wellington
whose
outposts
must
have
heard
and
seen
the
explosion
might
think
it
worth
while
to
dash
forward
and
endeavour
to
save
the
garrison
during
the
next
hours
therefore
cox
resolved
to
protract
his
resistance
as
long
as
was
possible
to
give
his
chief
the
option
of
fighting
if
he
should
so
please
but
the
defence
could
not
be
prolonged
for
more
than
a
day
or
two
at
the
most
at
nine
on
the
morning
of
the
masséna
sent
in
his
aide
de
camp
pelet
to
demand
the
surrender
of
the
fortress
cox
had
him
blindfolded
and
taken
into
a
casemate
for
their
interview
so
that
he
might
not
be
able
to
judge
of
the
awful
effects
of
the
explosion
the
usual
haggling
followed
the
french
officer
threatened
that
the
place
should
be
escaladed
at
once
and
the
garrison
put
to
the
sword
the
governor
replied
that
his
walls
were
intact
that
he
could
still
defend
himself
and
that
the
deplorable
accident
had
not
appreciably
diminished
his
resisting
power
but
he
finally
consented
to
send
out
an
officer
to
the
french
camp
to
negotiate
for
terms
all
this
was
merely
done
to
gain
time
and
the
semaphore
on
the
western
ramparts
was
signalling
desperate
messages
to
wellington
all
the
morning
there
is
a
good
account
of
this
interview
in
sprünglin
s
the
diarist
having
accompanied
pelet
into
the
town
cox
s
attempt
to
gain
time
was
fruitless
for
a
reason
that
he
had
not
foreseen
the
garrison
was
hopelessly
demoralized
knew
that
it
must
surrender
and
did
not
see
why
it
should
expose
itself
to
another
day
s
bombardment
for
a
lost
cause
during
the
conference
in
the
casemate
general
d
alorna
and
other
portuguese
officers
on
masséna
s
staff
came
out
of
the
trenches
and
boldly
presented
themselves
at
the
foot
of
the
walls
calling
to
their
compatriots
above
and
beseeching
them
to
accept
the
good
terms
offered
and
not
to
risk
their
lives
for
wellington
who
would
abandon
them
just
as
he
had
abandoned
herrasti
at
ciudad
rodrigo
the
officers
on
the
ramparts
ought
to
have
driven
the
renegades
away
by
shots
if
necessary
but
far
from
doing
so
they
entered
into
long
conversation
with
them
and
approved
their
arguments
d
alorna
recognized
some
old
acquaintances
among
the
regulars
and
pledged
his
word
to
them
that
an
assault
was
imminent
and
that
they
were
doomed
if
they
made
any
resistance
what
was
still
more
unlucky
for
cox
was
that
the
officer
whom
he
sent
out
to
the
french
camp
to
treat
major
barreiros
of
the
artillery
was
one
of
those
who
were
most
convinced
that
further
defence
was
fruitless
he
divulged
the
hopeless
state
of
the
place
to
the
marshal
and
bade
him
press
his
attack
without
fear
for
the
garrison
would
not
fight
he
himself
remained
at
the
french
head
quarters
and
did
not
return
to
almeida
masséna
therefore
sent
back
a
blank
refusal
of
all
cox
s
demands
and
conditions
and
ordered
the
bombardment
to
recommence
at
seven
in
the
evening
while
approaches
were
thrown
out
from
the
second
parallel
towards
the
ramparts
a
feeble
musketry
fire
alone
replied
the
renewal
of
the
bombardment
speedily
brought
matters
inside
the
place
to
a
head
a
deputation
of
portuguese
officers
headed
by
bernardo
da
costa
the
second
in
command
visited
cox
and
informed
him
that
further
resistance
was
madness
and
that
if
he
did
not
at
once
hoist
the
white
flag
they
would
open
the
gates
to
the
enemy
the
governor
was
forced
to
yield
and
capitulated
at
eleven
o
clock
on
the
night
of
the
masséna
granted
him
the
terms
that
the
regular
troops
should
be
sent
as
prisoners
to
france
while
the
three
militia
regiments
should
be
allowed
to
disperse
to
their
homes
on
giving
their
parole
not
to
serve
again
during
the
war
on
the
morning
of
the
the
garrison
marched
out
still
strong
its
total
loss
during
the
siege
having
been
some
nearly
all
destroyed
in
the
explosion
the
french
had
lost
killed
and
wounded
during
the
operations
the
capitulation
was
no
sooner
ratified
than
it
was
violated
instead
of
dismissing
the
militia
and
marching
off
the
regulars
towards
france
masséna
kept
them
together
and
set
the
renegades
d
alorna
and
pamplona
to
tempt
them
to
enter
the
french
service
the
officers
were
promised
confirmation
of
their
rank
the
men
were
invited
to
compare
the
relative
advantages
of
prison
and
of
joining
the
victorious
side
and
keeping
their
liberty
the
arguments
of
the
traitors
seemed
to
prevail
almost
the
whole
of
the
regulars
and
of
the
militia
signified
their
consent
to
enlist
with
the
enemy
the
rest
of
the
militia
were
turned
loose
but
d
alorna
was
able
to
organize
a
brigade
of
three
battalions
to
serve
the
emperor
as
the
second
portuguese
legion
but
the
intentions
of
these
docile
recruits
were
quite
other
than
masséna
had
supposed
they
had
changed
their
allegiance
merely
in
order
to
escape
being
sent
to
france
and
while
left
unguarded
during
the
next
three
days
absconded
in
bands
of
or
at
a
time
officers
and
all
and
kept
presenting
themselves
at
silveira
s
and
wellington
s
outposts
for
a
week
the
french
undeceived
too
late
disarmed
the
few
men
remaining
in
the
camp
who
were
packed
off
to
france
to
rejoin
cox
and
the
officers
who
had
loyally
refused
to
accept
d
alorna
s
offers
wellington
had
been
somewhat
alarmed
when
the
first
news
of
the
adhesion
of
the
garrison
to
the
french
cause
reached
him
fearing
that
it
implied
serious
disaffection
in
the
whole
portuguese
army
he
was
soon
undeceived
on
this
point
as
the
troops
gradually
streamed
in
to
his
camp
but
he
was
then
seized
with
grave
doubts
as
to
whether
he
could
consistently
with
military
honour
accept
the
service
of
these
perjured
but
patriotic
people
it
was
well
enough
for
the
private
men
but
highly
disgraceful
to
the
character
of
the
officers
he
observed
and
was
pondering
what
should
be
done
and
proposing
to
cashier
the
officers
when
he
received
a
proclamation
from
the
regency
approving
the
conduct
of
the
deserters
and
restoring
them
to
their
place
in
the
army
finally
he
resolved
that
since
masséna
had
obviously
broken
the
capitulation
by
his
action
it
might
be
held
that
it
was
not
binding
on
the
prisoners
and
ordered
the
regiment
to
be
at
its
head
quarters
at
braganza
the
militia
he
dismissed
to
their
homes
on
the
scruple
that
the
french
had
let
some
though
not
all
of
them
go
free
after
the
capitulation
there
remained
the
problem
of
what
was
to
be
done
with
the
portuguese
officers
who
had
played
a
treacherous
part
on
the
especially
barreiros
the
negotiator
who
had
betrayed
the
state
of
the
town
to
masséna
and
da
costa
who
had
headed
the
mutinous
deputation
to
cox
which
forced
him
to
surrender
finally
their
names
were
included
with
those
of
the
officers
who
had
served
on
masséna
s
portuguese
staff
during
the
campaign
in
a
great
indictment
placed
before
a
special
commission
on
traitors
called

sat
at
lisbon
during
the
autumn
all
from

downwards
were
declared
guilty
of

da

was
shot
not
for
treason
but
for
cowardice
and
mutiny
during
the
siege
of
almeida
the
british
army
had
been
held
in
a
position
somewhat
less
advanced
and
more
concentrated
than
that
which
it
had
occupied
in
july
wellington
had
brought
back
his
head
quarters
from
alverca
to
celorico
where
he
had
the
light
division
under
his
hand
a
few
miles
behind
on
the
running
down
the
south
bank
of
the
mondego
was
the
division
at
villa
cortes
picton
and
the
division
had
been
drawn
back
from
pinhel
to
carapichina
but
cole
and
the
remained
firm
at
guarda
the
portuguese
brigades
of
coleman
and
campbell
were
at
pinhanços
that
of
pack
at
jegua
the
whole
of
the
cavalry
had
come
up
from
the
rear
to
join
the
brigade
that
had
recently
operated
under
craufurd
s
orders
they
now
lay
in
a
thick
line
of
six
regiments
from
in
front
of
guarda
through
alverca
and
freixadas
to
lamegal
thus
the
whole
army
was
concentrated
on
a
short
front
of
fifteen
miles
covering
the
watershed
between
the
coa
and
the
mondego
and
the
bifurcation
of
the
roads
which
start
from
celorico
down
the
two
banks
of
the
river
the
french
held
back
close
to
almeida
with
a
strong
advance

at
pinhel
and
occasionally
raided
the
low
country
towards
the
douro
in
the
direction
of
villanova

and
castel
rodrigo
about
august
wellington
moved
forward
a
day
s
march
the
front
of
his
infantry
columns
being
pushed
up
to
alverca
and
freixadas
on
a
false
rumour
that
masséna
was
leaving
the
corps
unsupported
at
almeida
and
had
drawn
back
junot
into
the
plains
of
leon
if
this
had
been
the
case
wellington
intended
to
make
a
push
to
relieve
the
besieged
fortress
but
he
soon
discovered
that
the
report
was
baseless
and
that
the
corps
was
still
on
the
azava
and
the
agueda
wherefore
he
halted
and
was
still
lying
twelve
miles
in
front
of
celorico
when
the
noise
of
the
explosion
at
almeida
and
the
cessation
of
fire
on
the
next
day
betrayed
the
fact
that
the
place
had
fallen
and
that
there
was
no
longer
any
reason
for
maintaining
a
forward
position
on
the
night
of
the
therefore
the
whole
army
was
drawn
back
once
more
to
the
strong
line
between
guarda
and
celorico
and
arrangements
were
made
for
a
further
retreat
in
case
the
french
should
follow
up
the
capture
of
almeida
by
an
instant
and
general
advance
masséna
seemed
at
first
likely
to
make
this
move
on
september
a
brigade
of
infantry
and
horse
drove
in
the
british
cavalry
outposts
to
maçal
de
chão
only
five
miles
in
front
of
celorico
looking
upon
this
as
the
commencement
of
the
serious
invasion
of
portugal
wellington
sent
back
his
infantry
to
villa
cortes
pinhanços
and
moita
far
down
the
on
the
south
of
the
mondego
and
bade
cole
draw
in
the
division
from
guarda
to
san
martinho
under
the
north
side
of
the
serra
da
estrella
only
cavalry
were
left
at
and
in
front
of
celorico
and
guarda
this
retreat
shows
that
wellington
was
fully
convinced
that
the
french
would
advance
along
the
to
the
south
of
the
mondego
where
he
intended
to
stand
at
bay
on
the
alva
behind
the
entrenchments
of
ponte
de
murcella
the
main
point
of
interest
at
this
moment
was
the
movements
of
the
french
corps
which
still
lay
in
cantonments
at
zarza
and
coria
in
front
of
hill
guarda
being
no
longer
held
in
force
it
was
clear
that
hill
could
not
safely
join
the
main
army
by
the
road
if
reynier
moved
up
by
the
pass
of
perales
to
alfayates
and
sabugal
wellington
began
an
anxious
daily
correspondence
with
hill
giving
him
a
new
line
of
march
by
sobreira
formosa
villa
d
el
rei
and
espinhal
for
his
junction
but
ordering
him
to
be
sure
that
he
did
not
move
till
reynier
had
thoroughly
committed
himself
to
the
transference
of
his
whole
force
to
the
north
of
the
sierra
de
gata
for
it
would
be
disastrous
if
feints
should
induce
the
british
detaining
force
to
leave
villa
velha
and
abrantes
uncovered
and
reynier
should
turn
out
to
have
selected
them
as
his
objective
and
to
be
meditating
an
invasion
along
the
castello
branco
line
it
was
even
possible
though
not
likely
that
masséna
might
bring
up
the
and
corps
to
join
reynier
instead
of
bringing
reynier
across
the
mountains
to
join
them
but
every
contingency
had
to
be
provided
against
the
unlikely
ones
as
well
as
the
likely
as
a
corollary
to
hill
s
march
that
of
leith
had
also
to
be
arranged
he
must
wait
at
thomar
till
it
was
certain
that
the
corps
had
moved
but
the
moment
that
certainty
was
obtained
must
march
for
ponte
de
murcella
and
join
the
main
army
if
the
french
had
gone
north
but
support
hill
on
the
castello
branco
road
if
they
had
taken
the
other
and
less
probable
course
see
wellington
to

of
the
was
much
worried
by
a
false
rumour
that
reynier
was
already
in
force
at
sabugal
on
and
then
by
an
equally
false
one
that
the
whole
corps
had
marched
south
towards
the
tagus
and
was
about
to
cross
it
near
alcantara
see
the
letter
to
la
romana
of
as
a
matter
of
fact
reynier
made
no
definite
move
from
zarza
till
though
he
had
made
feints
in
both
the
directions
indicated
with
small
forces
that
this
possibility
was
in
wellington
s
mind
is
shown
by
the
letter
to
la
romana
of
from
gouvea
in
which
he
writes

never

from
the
disaster
of
the

not

and
some
of

more
important

fragment
the

twelve
miles
south
of

so
that
the
place
has
had
no
chance
of

and
remains
in

state
of
decay
the

s
hasty
repairs
in
the
vast

mentioned
in

but
intact
the
surrounding
is
a
low
rolling
treeless
upland
the
edge
of
the
vast
plains
of
leon
it
contrasts
very
strongly
with
the
hilly
and
picturesque
scenery
that
is
reached
when
once
the
coa
has
been
passed
from
almeida
the
ground
slopes
down
sharply
to
the
place
of
craufurd
s
celebrated
skirmish
the
town
is
not
visible
after
the
first
mile
of
the
descent
towards
the
gorge
through
which
the
coa
cuts
its
way

is
very
bad
for

being
steep
filled
with
great
stones
and
in
many
places
shut
in
by
high
banks
which
tower
above
it
and
make
it
narrow
the
sharp
turn
at
the
end
where
it
descends
to
the
river
with
a
sudden
twist
must
have
been
specially
tiresome
to
a
force
with
cavalry
and
guns
compelled
to
a
hasty
retreat
all
the
slopes
about
the
road
are
cut
up
into
small
fields
by
high
walls
of
undressed
stone
without

such
as

the

not
visible
till
the
traveller
approaching
from
almeida
has
got
down
to
the
level
of
the
river
it
is
completely
masked
by
the
high
knoll
described
in
the
text
so
long
as
he
is
descending
the
slope
above
from
the
point
where
the
road
swerves
aside
to
avoid
this
knoll
there
is
a
rough
down
to
the
still
invisible
bridge
but
this
is
not
available
for
guns
horses
or
infantry
only
for
men
scrambling
individually
the
bridge
is
seventy
yards
long
it
crosses
the
coa
diagonally
with
a
curious
twist
in
the
middle
where
there
is
a
little
monument
recording
the
reparation
of
the
structure
by
john
vi
in
the
days
after
the
war
was
over
there
is
no
mention
of
craufurd
s
fight
in
the
inscription
only
a
laudation
of
the
king
the
bridge
crosses
the
river
at
a
sort
of
gorge
the
place
where
the
rocks
on
the
two
sides
come
nearest
hence
the
stream
runs
under
it
very
fiercely
being
constricted
to
far
less
than
its
normal
breadth
the
channel
broadens
and
the
passage
looks
much
less
formidable
but
for
some
distance
on
each
side
of
the
bridge
the
river
is
very
rapid
darting
between
rocks
and
boulders
the
little
corner
where
the
few
french
who
passed
the
bridge
found
a
small
angle
of
can
be
easily
identified
it
was
just
to
their
right
after
crossing
all
the
rest
of
the
ground
on
the
west
bank
could
be
thoroughly
searched
by
the
british
guns
which
were
placed
a
few
hundred
yards
up
the
road
on
the
left
hand
as
well
as
by
the
fire
of
the
infantry
ensconced
among
rocks
and
boulders
above
the
bridge
of
the
french
attacking
force
during
the
early
part
of
the
skirmish
those
who
were
on
their
left
nearest
the
river
and
opposite
the
had
far
easier
ground
to
cover
than
those
on
the
right
opposite
the
it
is
not
so
high
or
rough
and
less
cut
up
by
stone
walls
hence
the
stress
on
the
ought
to
have
been
the
heavier
yet
they
lost
only
men
to
the
of
the
the
damage
to
the
latter
must
have
been
caused
partly
when
the
cavalry
got
in
among
them
just
as
the
retreat
began
partly
when
they
stormed
the
knoll
to
cover
the
retreat
of
the
the
scene
of
the
fight
is
most
picturesque
on
a
small
scale
one
of
the

pyrenees
to
the
sea
whose
places
of
strength
were
lerida
tarragona
and
tortosa
still
remained
intact
augereau
and
suchet
could
still
communicate
only
by
the
circuitous
route
through
france
a
letter
from
saragossa
to
barcelona
took
a
fortnight
or
more
to
arrive
at
its
destination
it
was
high
time
that
they
should
endeavour
to
get
into
touch
with
each
other
by
cutting
through
the
spanish
line
of
defence
both
of
the
had
now
a
comparatively
free
hand
and
could
assemble
a
considerable
force
for
offensive
operations
suchet
s
position
was
the
happier
he
had
no
spanish
army
opposed
to
him
at
the
moment
his
only
opponents
were
to
the
west
the
bold
guerrillero
mina
the
younger
on
the
borders
of
navarre
to
the
south
villacampa
with
the
dilapidated
remains
of
his
band
on
the
side
of
the
sierra
de
albaracin
and
molina
and
to
the
east
the
governor
of
lerida
who
kept
a
flying
force
under
colonel
perena
on
foot
between
the
cinca
and
the
segre
for
the
encouragement
of
the
insurgents
of
eastern
aragon
none
of
these
three
opponents
could
do
any
serious
mischief
to
the
corps
which
had
risen
by
the
new
year
of
to
a
strength
of
men
now
that
its
drafts
from
france
were
beginning
to
arrive
mina
was
the
most
tiresome
of
the
three
he
was
a
young
man
of
untiring
energy
and
kept
the
borders
of
navarre
in
a
perpetual
ferment
till
he
was
finally
put
down
by
mere
force
of
numbers
for
while
suchet
sent
a
number
of
columns
under
general
harispe
to
hunt
him
lagrange
s
division
of
the
newly
arrived
corps
came
down
from
the
side
of
pampeluna
and
swept
the
valleys
of
the
arga
and
the
aragon
from
the
other
quarter
pursued
from
one
refuge
to
another
by
men
mina
ended
by
bidding
his
followers
disperse
he
did
not
appear
again
as
a
combatant
till
the
corps
had
passed
on
into
castile
in
the
month
of
february
suchet
in
his
i
says
that
in
his
corps
was
only
strong
but
the
imperial
show
that
it
had
sous
les
besides
men
in
hospital
and
detached
in
that
month
villacampa
and
perena
being
very
weak
adversaries
suchet
could
now
dispose
of
the
greater
part
of
his
corps
for
offensive
operations
two
lines
of
attack
were
open
to
him
the
more
natural
and
obvious
one
was
to
attack
lerida
or
tortosa
while
augereau
and
the
corps
moved
against
them
from
the
other
side
this
was
suchet
s
own
intention
and
he
had
received
dispatches
from
paris
which
approved
of
the
plan
but
another
objective
was
pointed
out
to
him
from
another
quarter
it
will
be
remembered
that
while
king
joseph
and
soult
were
planning
the
details
of
their
andalusian
expedition
one
of
the
schemes
which
they
discussed
was
the
use
of
the
corps
as
a
flanking
detachment
to
cover
their
attack
on
seville
it
was
to
march
on
valencia
while
mortier
marched
on
badajoz
the
plan
was
rejected
in
favour
of
the
direct
frontal
march
against
the
passes
of
the
sierra
morena
nevertheless
when
the
defiles
had
been
passed
and
the
king
had
entered
cordova
in
triumph
he
recurred
to
his
original
scheme
and
on
january
soult
sent
orders
to
suchet
directing
him
to
make
a
dash
at
valencia
and
assuring
him
that
the
demoralization
of
the
spaniards
was
so
great
that
he
would
probably
enter
the
city
without
meeting
with
much
resistance
similar
orders
as
we
have
already
seen
were
sent
to
ney
who
was
directed
at
the
same
moment
to
make
himself
master
of
ciudad
rodrigo
which
soult
and
the
king
imagined
to
be
likely
to
surrender
at
the
first
summons
see
of
this
volume
see
suchet
though
doubting
as
he
says
the
wisdom
of
the
plan
of
campaign
imposed
upon
him
prepared
to
obey
and
concentrated
men
consisting
of
laval
s
division
and
half
that
of
musnier
at
teruel
on
the
borders
of
valencia
while
habert
with
six
battalions
more
was
to
move
in
a
separate
parallel
column
from
alcañiz
and
to
strike
down
on
to
the
of
valencia
by
way
of
morella
on
their
way
to
teruel
some
of
laval
s
columns
made
a
at
villacampa
and
drove
off
his
band
into
the
mountains
of
new
castile
the
march
on
valencia
had
already
begun
when
suchet
received
at
teruel
on
march
the
dispatch
from
the
emperor
which
announced
to
him
that
the
kingdom
of
aragon
had
been
made
an
independent
military
government
under
his
charge
and
that
he
was
for
the
future
to
take
no
orders
from
madrid
but
to
seek
all
his
instructions
from
paris
by
the
same
dispatch
suchet
was
informed
that
the
emperor
approved
of
the
plan
for
directing
the
corps
against
lerida
and
the
rear
of
catalonia
which
he
had
himself
always
advocated
but
since
habert
s
column
had
already
disappeared
in
the
mountains
and
could
not
be
recalled
and
since
his
own
advanced
guard
had
actually
crossed
the
borders
of
valencia
suchet
thought
that
it
was
now
too
late
to
turn
back
and
that
he
must
endeavour
to
carry
out
soult
s
orders
even
though
they
were
now
countermanded
by
the
emperor
accordingly
he
marched
by
sarrion
on
the
road
which
leads
from
teruel
to
segorbe
and
from
thence
to
murviedro
on
the
valencian
coast
where
habert
was
to
join
him
see
the
force
opposed
to
suchet
was
that
valencian
army
which
the
governor
or
rather
the
dictator
josé
caro
had
so
persistently
refused
to
lend
to
blake
in
the
preceding
autumn
for
the
relief
of
gerona
it
was
about
strong
at
the
moment
and
as
some
nine
months
had
elapsed
since
the
disaster
of
belchite
where
the
valencian
troops
had
fared
so
badly
the
regiments
had
been
recruited
up
to
their
old
strength
and
had
been
thoroughly
reorganized
and
nevertheless
caro
did
not
wish
to
risk
them
in
the
open
field
and
when
suchet
s
approach
was
reported
to
him
ordered
the
troops
to
prepare
to
retreat
within
the
walls
of
the
city
of
valencia
which
had
been
so
successfully
defended
against
moncey
two
years
before
he
was
probably
right
in
his
decision
having
no
great
superiority
of
numbers
over
the
french
invading
columns
he
would
have
been
risking
over
much
if
he
had
offered
battle
on
the
frontier
even
in
an
advantageous
position
behind
the
fortifications
of
valencia
which
had
been
improved
and
enlarged
during
the
last
two
years
he
could
at
least
be
certain
of
making
a
long
and
formidable
resistance
if
the
enemy
appeared
without
a
great
and
unprepared
for
a
regular
siege
the
garrison
would
be
absolutely
safe
accordingly
caro
sent
out
only
a
single
brigade
to
observe
and
retard
suchet
s
advance
this
force
assisted
by
some
armed
peasants
tried
to
hold
the
defile
of
alventosa
against
the
french
march
but
was
beaten
out
of
the
position
with
ease
lost
four
guns
and
retired
by
segorbe
and
murviedro
on
to
valencia
without
offering
further
resistance
suchet
following
in
the
wake
of
the
spanish
detachment
reached
murviedro
on
march
and
there
met
habert
whose
march
by
morella
and
had
been
absolutely
unopposed
a
day
later
the
french
appeared
in
front
of
the
fortifications
of
valencia
having
surveyed
the
outworks
and
summoned
the
place
in
vain
suchet
found
that
there
was
no
more
to
be
done
his
bolt
was
shot
the
city
intended
to
defend
itself
it
was
full
of
troops
and
the
whole
population
had
been
armed
caro
had
given
notice
that
the
defence
was
to
be
conducted
in
the
style
of
saragossa
and
as
a
foretaste
of
his
intentions
and
hanged
several
persons
who
were
accused
of
being
traitors
after
lying
four
days
in
front
of
valencia
suchet
marched
off
again
on
the
night
of
march
having
convinced
himself
that
he
had
been
sent
on
a
fool
s
errand
by
soult
and
king
joseph
for
the
expedition
had
only
been
undertaken
on
the
hypothesis
that
the
enemy
was
demoralized
and
ready
to
surrender
which
was
clearly
not
the
case
no
siege
train
had
been
brought
and
without
heavy
artillery
valencia
was
impregnable
the
retreat
of
the
french
was
hastened
by
the
fact
that
their
communications
with
aragon
had
already
been
cut
off
villacampa
undismayed
by
his
defeat
in
february
had
returned
to
the
front
the
moment
that
the
invading
columns
had
passed
on
to
the
valencian
coast
he
had
blockaded
the
garrison
of
teruel
cut
off
two
small
columns
which
were
moving
in
its
neighbourhood
and
captured
four
guns
and
some
prisoners
at
the
same
moment
though
suchet
was
unaware
of
the
fact
colonel
perena
with
a
detachment
from
lerida
had
made
a
demonstration
against
monzon
and
when
the
garrison
of
eastern
aragon
concentrated
to
defend
it
had
fallen
on
fraga
and
burnt
the
bridge
there
the
only
crossing
of
the
cinca
which
was
in
french
hands
mina
too
warned
of
the
departure
of
the
main
body
of
the
corps
for
the
south
had
reassembled
some
of
his
levies
and
begun
to
render
the
road
from
saragossa
to
pampeluna
once
more
unsafe
whether
the
conde
de
pozoblanco
and
the
other
persons
executed
were
really
traitors
is
very
doubtful
napier
takes
them
as
such
ii
suchet
denies
it
schepeler
says
iii
that
proclamations
of
king
joseph
and
treasonable
letters
were
found
in
the
count
s
house
toreno
ii
remains
doubtful
but
points
out
that
caro
and
pozoblanco
were
old
enemies
and
thinks
that
at
any
rate
there
was
personal
spite
in
the
matter
suchet
therefore
on
withdrawing
from
valencia
found
plenty
of
occupation
awaiting
him
in
aragon
villacampa
was
once
more
chased
into
the
wilds
of
the
sierra
de
albaracin
and
several
columns
were
detached
in
pursuit
of
mina
this
time
the
young
partisan
was
unfortunate
he
was
caught
between
one
of
suchet
s
detachments
and
a
party
sent
out
by
the
governor
of
navarre
and
taken
prisoner
on
march
with
some
scores
of
his
followers
his
place
however
was
taken
ere
long
by
his
uncle
espoz
y
mina
who
rallied
the
remnant
of
the
guerrilleros
of
aragon
and
continued
the
struggle
with
an
energy
as
great
and
a
success
far
greater
than
that
of
his
nephew
meanwhile
the
months
of
february
and
march
had
been
wasted
so
far
as
the
corps
was
concerned
and
it
was
not
till
april
that
suchet
was
able
to
take
in
hand
the
enterprise
which
he
himself
had
approved
and
to
which
the
emperor
had
now
given
his
consent
the
siege
of
lerida
a
few
weeks
after
his
return
to
saragossa
he
received
from
paris
two
imperial
letters
denouncing
his
late
campaign
as
presumptuous
objectless
and
altogether
deserving
of
high
condemnation
dated
from
compiègne
on
april
and
april
see
xx
and
while
the
valencian
expedition
had
been
in
progress
marshal
augereau
had
been
trying
his
hand
at
the
catalan
problems
which
verdier
and
cyr
had
found
so
puzzling
his
luck
had
been
bad
and
his
faults
had
been
many
for
of
all
the
who
successively
endeavoured
to
subjugate
the
untameable
principality
he
was
decidedly
the
least
capable
when
gerona
fell
the
main
body
of
his
army
was
let
loose
for
operations
in
the
open
field
but
verdier
s
divisions
on
whom
the
burden
of
the
siege
work
had
fallen
were
in
much
too
dilapidated
a
condition
for
active
service
leaving
them
to
recover
their
strength
and
gather
up
their
convalescents
in
cantonments
between
figueras
and
gerona
augereau
moved
southwards
in
january
at
the
head
of
the
troops
of
souham
and
pino
whose
two
divisions
still
counted
bayonets
with
the
eagles
though
they
left
behind
them
sick
in
the
hospitals
of
figueras
and
perpignan
in
january
verdier
s
french
and
westphalian
divisions
could
only
show
men
in
line
and
in
hospital
muster
roll
of
in
the
the
marshal
s
main
duty
at
this
moment
was
to
clear
the
road
from
figueras
to
barcelona
which
the
spanish
fortress
of
gerona
had
so
effectually
blocked
during
the
whole
year
all
further
advances
were
suspended
till
this
operation
should
have
been
completed
by
the
emperor
s
special
orders
duhesme
indeed
isolated
in
barcelona
with
some
men
communicating
with
france
only
by
sea
and
surrounded
by
a
discontented
population
which
was
reduced
to
by
the
blockade
kept
up
by
the
british
fleet
was
in
a
perilous
condition
there
had
been
many
who
thought
that
if
blake
in
october
had
marched
against
barcelona
instead
of
trying
to
throw
succours
into
gerona
he
would
have
forced
augereau
to
abandon
the
siege
of
the
latter
place
for
duhesme
would
have
been
in
such
danger
since
he
was
neither
strong
enough
to
fight
in
the
open
nor
to
man
efficiently
the
immense
circuit
of
the
walls
of
barcelona
that
augereau
might
probably
have
judged
that
it
was
better
to
save
the
capital
of
catalonia
than
to
continue
the
interminable
blockade
of
the
smaller
town
that
was
holding
out
so
obstinately
against
him
be
this
as
it
may
augereau
set
souham
s
and
pino
s
columns
on
the
march
early
in
january
after
having
first
executed
at
their
head
a
sort
of
of
the
of
the
mountains
around
gerona
as
far
as
ripol
and
campredon
his
progress
was
a
reign
of
terror
he
had
issued
on
december
a
proclamation
stating
that
all
irregulars
taken
with
arms
in
their
hands
were
to
be
treated
as
simple
highway
robbers
and
hung
without
any
form
of
trial
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
and
all
the
prisoners
taken
by
the
flying
columns
of
souham
and
pino
were
suspended
on
a
line
of
gallows
erected
on
the
between
gerona
and
figueras
these
atrocities
turned
the
war
in
catalonia
into
a
struggle
even
more
ferocious
than
that
of
for
the
natives
very
naturally
retaliated
upon
every
french
straggler
that
they
caught
and
the
spanish
regular
officers
had
great
difficulty
in
saving
the
lives
even
of
large
bodies
who
had
laid
down
their
arms
upon
formal
terms
of
surrender
the
text
of
this
bloodthirsty
document
may
be
found
in

are

of
its
execution

commanded

not

block

marshal
ordered
mazzuchelli

italian

to
form
the
siege
trusting
that
the
place
would
fall
in
a
few
days
but
finding
the
resistance
more
serious
than
he
had
expected
he
finally
continued
his
march
with
the
remainder
of
the
italian
division

granollers

had
ordered

meanwhile
augereau
with

italian

reached
granollers
and
came
into
touch
with

troops
just
in
time
to
find
that
a
disaster
had
preceded
his
arrival
the
governor

in
obedience
to
the
orders
sent
him
had
marched
out
on

with
three
battalions
and

in

to
meet

he
waited
four
days
at
granollers
and
then
left
the
brigade
under
the
charge
of
colonel
guétry
and
returned
in
person
to
barcelona
recalled
by
rumours
of
a
threatened
attack
from
the
side
of
tarragona
on
the
morning
after
his
departure
guétry
s
force
which
believed
itself
in
complete
security
was
suddenly
surprised
in
its
camps
by
a
detachment
sent
out
by
o
donnell
that
enterprising
officer
had
heard
that
augereau
was
still
twenty
miles
away
and
that
guétry
had
scattered
his
men
in
the
three
villages
of
santa
perpetua
mollet
and
granollers
in
order
to
cover
them
from
the
bitter
january
weather
accordingly
he
resolved
to
risk
an
attack
on
this
unwary
detachment
two
brigades
about
men
under
the
marquis
of
campo
verde
made
a
forced
march
across
the
mountains
and
fell
upon
the
villages
at
dawn
the
battalion
of
the
in
santa
perpetua
was
completely
cut
to
pieces
or
captured
only
two
men
are
said
to
have
escaped

the
cuirassiers
at

fared
somewhat
better

were

of

italian

regiment
which
was
posted
at

escaped
destruction
by
throwing
itself
into
a
fortified
convent
and
held
out
for
two
days
till
it
was
saved
by
the
approach
of
augereau
along
the
altogether
duhesme
s
division
was
thinned
by
the
loss
of
men
on

guétry
had
been
taken
prisoner
with
some
men
more
and
two
guns
the
spaniards
disappeared
the
moment
that
augereau
came
in
sight
and
rejoined
o
donnell
in
the
hills
augereau
entered
barcelona
on
the
and
at
once
asserted
his
authority
by
deposing
duhesme
from
the
governorship
and
sending
him
home
to
france
they
were
old
enemies
and
the
general
s
friends
regarded
his
disgrace
as
a
display
of
spite
on
the
part
of
his
superior
but
as
all
the
spanish
narratives
describe
the
dictatorship
of
duhesme
as
having
been
as
much
distinguished
for
private
rapacity
as
for
public
oppression
it
is
probable
that
the
marshal
s
action
was
wholly
justifiable
the
emperor
however
refused
to
sanction
the
prosecution
of
the
general
on
the
charges
laid
against
him
remarking
that
such
proceedings
would
give
too
much
pleasure
to
the
catalans

most

contrast
strangely
with

quotations
from
barcelonese
local
writers
napoleon
to
clarke
compiègne
april
having
concentrated
pino
s
and
souham
s
troops
at
barcelona
augereau
would
have
proceeded
to
advance
against
the
catalans
and
lay
siege
to
tarragona
but
for
one
fact
the
magazines
of
the
city
were
almost
empty
and
no
food
could
be
procured
for
the
army
indeed
after
a
very
few
days
it
was
necessary
for
the
marshal
to
retrace
his
steps
in
order
to
bring
up
an
enormous
convoy
for
the
revictualling
of
the
place
which
was
being
collected
at
perpignan
and
figueras
all
that
he
had
done
by
his
march
was
to
open
up
the
road
and
to
muzzle
the
fortress
of
hostalrich
which
was
still
being
blockaded
by
the
italians
accordingly
on
february
his
two
divisions
marched
back
each
by
the
way
that
it
had
originally
taken
souham
to
vich
where
he
halted
pino
to
gerona
where
the
convoy
began
presently
to
gather
escorted
thither
in
detachments
by
a
large
body
of
reinforcements
which
had
just
come
up
from
france
for
the
emperor
had
strengthened
the
army
of
catalonia
by
a
division
of
troops
of
the
confederation
of
the
rhine
under
general
rouyer
and
by
a
neapolitan
brigade
some
men
in
all
but
the
long
train
of
carts
and
mules
came
in
slowly
and
march
began
before
augereau
was
ready
to
move
meanwhile
his
lieutenant
souham
had
been
exposed
to
a
sudden
and
unexpected
peril
o
donnell
had
discovered
that
the
division
at
vich
was
completely
isolated
and
did
not
count
much
more
than
sabres
and
bayonets
having
reorganized
his
own
field
army
at
moya
near
manresa
and
brought
it
up
to
a
strength
of
foot
and
horse
by
calling
a
few
troops
from
tarragona
he
directed
the
somatenes
of
northern
catalonia
to
muster
on
the
other
side
of
vich
so
as
to
fall
on
souham
from
the
rear
the
indefatigable
miquelete
leaders
rovira
and
milans
got
together
between
and
men
despite
of
all
their
previous
losses
and
defeats
on
february
these
levies
thrust
in
the
pickets
of
the
french
division
on
the
eastern
side
but
souham
did
not
see
his
danger
till
on
the
following
morning
he
found
o
donnell
s
regular
troops
pouring
down
into
the
plain
of
vich
in
three
columns
and
challenging
him
to
a
battle
in
the
open
since
the
day
of
valls
the
catalan
army
had
never
tried
such
a
bold
stroke
the
french
general
was
greatly
outnumbered
he
had
but
infantry
and
horse
to
oppose
to
o
donnell
s
regulars
and
the
miqueletes
the
action
fell
into
two
separate
parts
while
rovira
and
milans
bickered
with
two
battalions
left
to
guard
the
town
of
vich
souham
fought
a
pitched
battle
against
the
spanish
main
body
with
the
eight
battalions
and
two
and
a
half
regiments
of
cavalry
which
constituted
the
remainder
of
his
force
it
was
a
fierce
and
fight
o
donnell
took
the
offensive
and
his
men
displayed
an
unwonted
vigour
and
initiative
unhappily
for
this
enterprising
general
his
small
body
of
horsemen
was
utterly
unable
to
restrain
or
to
cope
with
the
superior
french
cavalry
twice
the
battle
was
turned
by
the
charge
of
souham
s
squadrons
after
the
first
repulse
o
donnell
rallied
his
beaten
right
wing
threw
in
all
his
reserves
and
tried
to
outflank
the
shorter
french
line
on
both
sides
the
enemy
was
losing
heavily
and
showing
signs
of
yielding
when
the
whole
of
his
cavalry
made
a
second
desperate
charge
on
the
spanish
right
it
was
completely
successful
o
donnell
s
turning
column
composed
of
the
swiss
regiments
of
kayser
and
traxler
was
broken
and
the
larger
part
of
it
captured
thereupon
the
spanish
general
who
had
displayed
undaunted
courage
throughout
the
day
and
headed
several
charges
in
person
thought
it
time
to
retire
he
fell
back
on
the
mountains
leaving
behind
him
killed
and
wounded
and
prisoners
the
french
had
suffered
at
least
casualties
including
souham
himself
desperately
wounded
in
the
head
and
had
been
within
an
ace
of
destruction

their
superiority

with

besides

marched
in

to

with
the
italians
who
were
now
under
severoli
pino
having
gone
home
on
leave
and
the
newly
arrived
german
division
of
rouyer

was
left
behind
as
in

to
defend
the
ampurdam
from
the
incursions
of

passed
into

its

had

pursued
a
line
of
march
parallel
to
that
of
the
main
force
moving
from
vich
by
the
col
de
suspina
and
manresa
it
came
down
into
the
valley
of
the
llobregat
on
the
same
day
that
pino
s
and
rouyer
s
troops
reached
it
by
the
other
route
the
marshal
and
the
main
column
had
made
their
way
past
hostalrich
which
was
found
still
unsubdued
and
still
blockaded
by
mazzuchelli
s
brigade
which
had
been
left
opposite
it
in
january
these
troops
were
ordered
to
join
their
division
a
mixed
detachment
under
colonel
devaux
being
left
in
their
stead
to
watch
the
castle
the
marshal
then
took
up
his
residence
in
the
palace
at
barcelona
and
had
himself
proclaimed
governor
of
catalonia
with
great
state
in
consonance
with
the
imperial
decree
of
february
which
had
taken
the
principality
out
of
the
hands
of
king
joseph
and
made
its
administrator
responsible
to
paris
alone
and
not
to
madrid
augereau
established
himself
permanently
at
barcelona
and
proceeded
during
the
next
two
months
to
act
rather
as
a
viceroy
than
as
a
the
conduct
of
military
operations
he
handed
over
to
his
brother
to
the
unbounded
disgust
of
the
other
generals
in
what
proportions
the
responsibility
for
the
disasters
which
followed
should
be
distributed
between
the
two
augereaus
it
is
hard
to
say
but
napoleon
very
naturally
and
reasonably
placed
it
on
the
marshal
s
shoulders
and
wrote
that
ce
n
est
point
en
restant
dans
les
capitales
éloignées
de
l
armée
que
des
généraux
en
chef
peuvent
acquérir
de
la
gloire
ou
mériter
mon
estime
the
force
assembled
on
the
llobregat
was
now
a
very
large
one
consisting
of
three
divisions
those
of
augereau
severoli
and
rouyer
it
numbered
nearly
men
for
along
with
the
convoy
there
had
marched
a
mass
of
drafts
for
the
old
regiments
of
the
corps
which
brought
their
battalions
up
to
full
strength
from
compiègne
april
severoli
s
division
alone
numbered
foot
and
horse
at
the
moment
there
were
only
two
rational
plans
of
campaign
open
to
the
french
the
one
was
to
march
on
tarragona
with
a
and
to
complete
the
conquest
of
catalonia
by
the
capture
of
its
greatest
fortress
the
other
was
to
mask
tarragona
and
to
strike
across
the
principality
westward
in
order
to
get
into
communication
with
suchet
and
the
army
of
aragon
by
way
of
igualada
cervera
and
lerida
if
the
two
corps
could
meet
northern
catalonia
would
be
completely
isolated
from
tarragona
tortosa
and
valencia
it
was
this
latter
plan
which
augereau
had
been
ordered
to
carry
out
by
his
master
he
was
directed
to
march
on
lerida
and
to
join
suchet
before
that
place
by
a
dispatch
of
february
he
had
been
informed
that
on
march
the
army
of
aragon
would
have
arrived
before
lerida
and
would
be
forming
its
siege
this
prophecy
was
false
for
suchet
as
we
have
seen
had
gone
off
on
his
valencian
expedition
and
was
at
teruel
on
the
appointed
day
it
was
impossible
to
direct
from
paris
a
combined
movement
depending
on
accurate
timing
for
its
success
but
augereau
should
have
attempted
to
carry
out
the
order
sent
him
by
his
master
with
proper
zeal
and
dispatch
this
he
failed
to
do
his
own
inclination
was
to
strike
a
blow
at
tarragona
and
the
movements
of
his
corps
show
that
this
was
the
operation
which
he
had
determined
to
carry
out
instead
of
marching
in
person
with
his
main
body
on
cervera
and
lerida
he
directed
his
brother
to
take
his
own
and
severoli
s
divisions
and
to
move
by
villafranca
on
reus
a
large
town
twelve
miles
to
the
of
tarragona
and
suitable
as
a
base
of
operations
against
that
city
march
a
battalion
and
a
half
was
dropped
at
villafranca
to
keep
open
the
communications
between
reus
and
barcelona
while
a
brigade
of
rouyer
s
newly
arrived
germans
under
the
schwartz
the
vanquished
of
bruch
and
esparraguera
was
placed
as
a
sort
of
at
manresa
on
march
a
summons
was
sent
in
to
tarragona
demanding
surrender
this
was
of
course
refused
the
town
was
full
of
troops
for
henry
o
donnell
had
just
strengthened
its
garrison
by
retiring
into
it
himself
with
the
men
who
represented
the
remains
of
his
field
army
napoleon
to
clarke
from
paris
cf
another
dispatch

no

the
see

pp
the
spanish
general
contemplating
the
position
of
affairs
with
a
wary
eye
had
convinced
himself
that
he
could
stop
general
augereau
s
further
movements
by
striking
at
his
line
of
communication
with
barcelona
this
he
proceeded
to
do
in
the
most
skilful
and
successful
fashion
before
the
enemy
closed
in
upon
tarragona
he
sent
out
a
picked
force
under
general
juan
caro
with
orders
to
attack
villafranca
and
manresa
without
a
moment
s
delay
this
daring
stroke
was
completely
successful
caro
stormed
villafranca
at
dawn
on
march
and
took
or
captured
the
whole
of
the
men
posted
there
he
was
wounded
and
had
to
hand
over
his
command
to
campo
verde
who
after
some
preliminary
skirmishing
lasting
for
three
days
completed
the
little
campaign
by
driving
schwartz
out
of
manresa
after
a
heavy
fight
on
april
in
which
the
german
brigade
lost
officers
and
men
the
somatenes
turned
out
to
hunt
the
routed
force
as
it
retired
on
barcelona
and
inflicted
many
further
losses
so
that
schwartz
only
brought
back
a
third
of
his
brigade
to
the
marshal
the
officer
barckhausen
says
in
his
diary
that
only
officers
and
men
were
lost
but
martinien
s
lists
show
officers
of
the
nassau
ducal
saxon
and
regiments
killed
or
wounded
at
or
near
manresa
on
the
of
april
the
touch
between
the
two
divisions
at
reus
and
the
garrison
of
barcelona
was
thus
completely
severed
moreover
augereau
feared
lest
the
next
move
of
the
raiding
force
might
be
an
attack
on
the
isolated
force
under
colonel
devaux
which
was
blockading
hostalrich
he
therefore
sent
out
a
brig
with
one
of
his
on
board
bearing
orders
to
his
brother
and
severoli
to
return
at
once
to
his
head
quarters
with
their
troops
by
good
fortune
the
messenger
reached
his
destination
without
being
intercepted
by
english
cruisers
and
the
two
divisions
started
on
their
march
back
to
barcelona
on
april
only
two
days
before
severoli
more
by
luck
than
by
skill
had
got
for
a
moment
into
touch
with
the
army
of
aragon
an
exploring
column
of
two
battalions
under
colonel
villatte
which
he
had
sent
out
westward
to
falcet
in
the
direction
of
the
ebro
met
entirely
by
chance
a
similar
detachment
of
musnier
s
division
of
the
corps
which
had
advanced
to
mora
on
interchanging
news
of
their
respective
armies
villatte
learnt
from
his
colleague
that
suchet
was
at
this
moment
marching
on
lerida
where
according
to
the
emperor
s
instructions
to
marshal
augereau
he
ought
to
have
arrived
more
than
a
month
before
villatte
brought
back
the
information
to
severoli
but
the
latter
could
make
no
use
of
it
while
he
was
under
orders
to
return
without
delay
to
barcelona
he
and
general
augereau
accomplished
their
retreat
in
three
days
much
harassed
on
the
way
not
only
by
the
somatenes
of
the
mountains
but
also
by
o
donnell
who
followed
them
with
a
detachment
of
the
garrison
of
tarragona
they
took
some
small
revenge
on
him
however
at
villafranca
where
they
turned
on
the
pursuers
and
inflicted
a
sharp
check
on
their
advanced
guard
which
was
pressing
in
with
more
courage
than
discretion
on
a
force
which
outnumbered
it
by
four
to
one
on
april
the
whole
army
was
encamped
outside
the
walls
of
barcelona
counting
the
garrison
augereau
had
now
more
than
men
in
hand
but
not
contented
with
this
concentration
he
sent
orders
back
to
the
ampurdam
ordering
verdier
to
bring
forward
as
many
troops
as
possible
to
gerona
and
from
thence
to
push
forward
down
the
as
far
as
granollers
so
as
to
succour
devaux
if
the
spaniards
should
show
any
intention
of
relieving
hostalrich
for
details
of
villatte
s
expedition
see
vacani
iv
the
marshal
s
next
move
lost
him
the
favour
of
napoleon
and
led
to
his
removal
in
disgrace
to
paris
on
april
he
issued
orders
to
severoli
to
march
on
hostalrich
and
there
to
take
over
the
conduct
of
the
siege
from
devaux
while
at
the
same
time
he
himself
moved
back
to
gerona
with
his
brother
s
french
division
and
an
immense
train
consisting
partly
of
the
empty
carts
of
the
convoy
which
he
had
brought
south
in
march
partly
of
confiscated
property
of
all
sorts
from
barcelona
augereau
s
excuse
for
this
retrograde
movement
which
abandoned
all
central
catalonia
to
the
enemy
was
that
his
army
would
have
exhausted
the
magazines
of
barcelona
if
he
had
kept
it
concentrated
for
ten
days
more
and
that
he
had
no
other
way
of
feeding
it
since
the
activity
of
the
somatenes
made
the
dispatch
of
foraging
detachments
utterly
impossible
the
moral
effect
of
the
move
was
deplorable
after
taking
in
hand
an
offensive
movement
against
tarragona
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
checked
by
an
enemy
hopelessly
inferior
in
numbers
had
lost
over
men
in
petty
combats
and
then
had
retired
to
the
base
from
which
he
had
started
in
january
three
months
had
been
wasted
and
nothing
had
been
gained
save
that
the
small
castle
of
hostalrich
was
now
in
a
desperate
condition
for
want
of
food
and
must
fall
if
not
speedily
succoured
what
rendered
the
position
of
augereau
the
more
shameful
was
that
he
had
now
in
front
of
him
only
a
skeleton
enemy
for
o
donnell
at
this
moment
was
distracted
by
the
advance
of
suchet
against
lerida
and
had
been
forced
to
draw
off
towards
the
borders
of
aragon
two
of
the
four
divisions
into
which
he
had
reorganized
his
little
field
army
facing
augereau
there
was
only
campo
verde
s
division
of
regulars
not
over
strong
and
the
bands
of
the
mountains
it
was
against
such
an
enemy
that
the
marshal
had
concentrated
men
including
verdier
s
force
between
hostalrich
and
gerona
according
to
spanish
accounts
this
included
much
property
belonging
to
the
marshal
himself
and
other
superior
officers
ferrer
see
arteche
viii
declares
that
augereau
carried
off
all
the
furniture
of
the
royal
palace
the
on
which
those
who
defend
augereau
lay
all
the
stress
possible
was
no
doubt
a
very
real
one
the
feeding
of
barcelona
with
its
garrison
and
its
large
civil
population
by
means
of
convoys
brought
from
france
was
no
easy
task
but
it
seems
clear
that
with
the
large
force
at
his
disposition
the
corps
was
over
strong
augereau
could
have
organized
sufficiently
powerful
to
defy
the
spaniards
without
abandoning
the
offensive
position
in
front
of
barcelona
which
was
to
him
he
might
have
set
aside
men
for
that
purpose
and
still
have
kept
a
strong
field
army
together
had
he
done
so
o
donnell
could
not
have
dared
to
march
with
men
the
pick
of
the
catalan
army
to
relieve
lerida
while
his
old
enemies
were
massed
awaiting
an
impossible
attack

away

defence

in

but
were
in
hospital
or
detached
meanwhile
the
one
task
which
was
completed
by
the
corps
during
the
months
of
april
and
may
was
the
reduction
of
hostalrich
the
little
castle
was
a
place
of
strength
perched
high
above
the
abandoned
town
to
which
it
belonged
it
was
garrisoned
by
two
battalions
one
of
granadan
regulars
from
reding
s
old
division
the
other
of
local
catalan
levies
under
colonel
juliano
estrada
an
officer
of
high
spirit
and
commendable
obstinacy
to
the
first
summons
made
to
him
in
january
by
augereau
he
had
replied
that
hostalrich
was
the
child
of
gerona
and
would
know
how
to
emulate
the
conduct
of
the
nor
was
this
epigram
belied
by
the
of
the
garrison
hostalrich
held
out
from
january
to
may
without
receiving
either
a
convoy
from
without
or
any
reinforcements
twice
the
local
miqueletes
attempted
to
pass
succours
into
the
castle
but
on
each
occasion
they
were
driven
off
after
having
barely
succeeded
in
communicating
with
estrada
their
convoys
never
got
close
enough
to
enter
the
gates
at
last
on
may
the
provisions
of
the
place
were
completely
exhausted
thereupon
estrada
took
in
hand
a
scheme
which
was
only
tried
by
one
other
governor
during
the
whole
peninsular
war
the
frenchman
brennier
at
almeida
in
may
he
put
every
man
of
the
garrison
under
arms
at
midnight
issued
silently
from
the
castle
and
charged
at
the
besiegers
lines
with
the
intention
of
cutting
his
way
through
to
campo
verde
s
head
quarters
in
the
mountains
he
was
fortunate
enough
to
pierce
the
italian
outposts
at
the
first
rush
but
two
whole
brigades
were
presently
at
his
heels
his
guides
lost
their
way
among
cliffs
and
ravines
and
he
was
overtaken
turning
back
with
his
rearguard
to
fend
off
the
pursuers
he
was
wounded
and
taken
prisoner
ten
other
officers
and
some
soldiers
shared
his
fate
the
rest
of
the
garrison
dispersed
in
the
hills
and
reached
vich
in
small
parties
to
the
number
of
men
if
only
their
gallant
commander
had
escaped
with
them
the
exploit
would
have
been
an
exact
parallel
to
the
almeida
sortie
of
one
battalion
of
iliberia
or
of
granada
and
one
tercio
of
levies
from
the
province
of
gerona
total
strength
about
bayonets
the
reduction
of
hostalrich
and
of
a
small
fort
on
the
isles
of
las
medas
near
the
mouth
of
the
ter
were
the
last
achievements
of
the
army
of
catalonia
while
it
was
under
the
command
of
augereau
on
april
the
emperor
had
resolved
to
remove
him
from
his
post
and
had
ordered
marshal
macdonald
duke
of
tarentum
to
relieve
him
in
the
it
was
merely
stated
that
the
elder
marshal
had
been
forced
by
to
resign
his
charge
but
the
real
causes
of
his
displacement
are
plainly
stated
in
napoleon
s
letter
to
the
minister
of
war
they
were
the
blow
which
he
had
given
to
the
imperial
prestige
by
his
retreat
to
gerona
and
his
disobedience
in
having
failed
to
march
on
lerida
in
aid
of
suchet
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
wrath
of
the
emperor
was
justifiably
roused
its
final
manifestation
took
the
shape
of
a
minute
directing
that
when
the
published
the
news
of
the
successes
at
hostalrich
and
las
medas
the
name
of
augereau
was
to
be
kept
out
of
the
paragraph
and
only
those
of
his
subordinates
mentioned
see
napoleon
to
clarke
of
april
and
same
to
same
of
may
while
the
new
commander
of
the
corps
was
on
his
way
from
italy
to
perpignan
and
for
some
time
after
his
arrival
on
may
there
was
a
complete
suspension
of
active
operations
none
of
the
french
generals
in
the
principality
could
do
more
than
await
orders
and
keep
the
neighbourhood
of
his
cantonments
safe
from
the
irrepressible
miqueletes
the
whole
interest
of
the
french
operations
in
spain
during
this
period
turns
on
the
movements
of
the
army
of
aragon
on
returning
from
his
futile
valencian
expedition
suchet
had
found
awaiting
him
at
saragossa
orders
to
commence
without
delay
the
siege
of
lerida
and
promising
that
augereau
would
contain
the
spanish
army
of
catalonia
and
would
ultimately
open
up
communication
with
him
by
way
of
cervera
or
momblanch
in
obedience
to
the
imperial
mandate
the
commander
of
the
corps
collected
more
than
half
his
troops
for
the
expedition
against
lerida
this
concentration
entailed
the
abandonment
of
the
rough
country
of
southern
aragon
to
villacampa
and
his
bands
for
having
determined
to
leave
only
laval
s
division
behind
him
to
protect
the
central
parts
of
the
province
suchet
had
to
evacuate
the
region
of
teruel

and
montalvan

two
brigades
remained
in
the
valley
of
the

between

and

watching
the
debouches
from
the
mountains
the
other
two
divisions
of

were
destined
for

siege
of
lerida
musnier
with

marching
down
from

south

with
his
division
coming
from
the
side
of
saragossa
made
for
the
same
goal
by
way
of
alcubierre
and
monzon
it
might
seem
a
dangerous
experiment
to
march
the
two
isolated
columns
across
the
spanish
front
for
a
junction
at
a
point
so
remote
from
their
respective
but
for
the
moment
there
was
no
hostile
force
of
any
importance
in
their
neighbourhood
severoli
and
augereau
being
still
at
reus
when
musnier
and
habert
started
on
their
way
o
donnell
could
spare
no
troops
for
the
relief
of
lerida
it
was
not
till
they
had
retired
and
the
duke
of
castiglione
had
withdrawn
all
his
forces
to
hostalrich
and
gerona
that
the
found
himself
free
for
an
expedition
to
the
west
in
front
of
musnier
while
he
was
marching
on
lerida
there
were
nothing
but
trifling
detachments
sent
out
for
purposes
of
observation
by
the
governor
of
tortosa
in
front
of
habert
there
were
only
men
under
colonel
perena
thrown
out
from
lerida
to
observe
the
open
country
between
the
segre
and
the
cinca
this
was
the
sole
which
remained
from
the
old
spanish
army
of
aragon
with
the
exception
of
the
two
dilapidated
regiments
that
formed
the
nucleus
of
villacampa
s
band
it
was
with
a
detachment
of
this
column
that
severoli
s
flanking
party
under
villatte
got
into
communication
on
april
as
detailed
above
page
on
april
suchet
arrived
at
monzon
with
a
brigade
of
infantry
and
the
six
companies
of
artillery
and
four
of
engineers
which
were
destined
for
the
siege
of
lerida
on
the
thirteenth
he
was
before
the
walls
of
the
place
on
the
west
bank
of
the
segre
while
on
the
next
day
habert
appeared
on
the
other
bank
driving
before
him
colonel
perena
and
his
battalions
this
second
french
column
had
passed
the
segre
at
balaguer
from
which
it
had
expelled
the
spanish
brigade
perena
having
the
choice
between
returning
into
the
mountains
or
strengthening
the
garrison
of
lerida
had
taken
the
latter
alternative
on
the
same
day
musnier
came
up
from
the
south
and
joined
the
army
with
the
force
that
had
started
from
alcañiz
and
had
crossed
the
ebro
at
flix
suchet
had
now
concentrated
the
whole
of
the
men
whom
he
destined
for
the
siege
for
his
strength
at
this
moment
see
the
table
which
he
gives
in
his
vol
i
appendix
his
figures
can
not
always
be
trusted
for
instance
purporting
in
this
table
to
give
his
whole
force
present
at
lerida
or
detached
in
aragon
he
omits
the
six
squadrons
of
gendarmerie
which
were
guarding
his
rear
officers
men
and
the
four
battalions
of
des
who
were
garrisoning
jaca
venasque
about
men
the
town
of
lerida
then
containing
some
inhabitants
lies
in
a
vast
treeless
plain
on
the
western
bank
of
the
broad
and
rapid
segre
its
topography
is
peculiar
out
of
the
dead
level
of
the
plain
rise
two
steep
and
isolated
hills
one
of
these
about
yards
long
by
broad
and
rising
feet
above
the
surrounding
flats
is
crowned
by
the
citadel
of
the
town
the
other
somewhat
longer
but
rather
narrower
is
no
other
than
the
hill
about
which
caesar
and
afranius
contended
in
the
old
civil
wars
of
rome
when
lerida
was
still
ilerda
it
lies
about
of
a
mile
from
the
height
in
its
culminating
summit
was
covered
by
a
large
work
called
fort
garden
and
its
southern
and
lower
end
was
protected
by
the
two
small
redoubts
called
san
fernando
and
el
pilar
the
town
occupies
the
flat
ground
between
the
and
the
river
it
has
no
suburb
but
only
a
strong
on
the
other
side
of
the
segre
the
strength
of
the
place
lay
in
the
fact
that
its
whole
eastern
front
was
protected
by
the
river
its
whole
western
front
by
the
citadel
the
comparatively
short
southern
front
was
under
the
guns
of
fort
garden
which
commanded
all
the
ground
over
which
an
enemy
could
approach
this
side
of
the
town
there
only
remained
unprotected
by
outer
works
the
northern
front
and
this
was
the
point
which
a
skilful
enemy
would
select
as
his
objective
another
fact
which
much
favoured
the
defence
was
that
the
besieger
was
forced
to
make
very
long
lines
of
investment
since
he
had
to
shut
in
not
only
the
town
but
the
whole
plateau
on
which
lie
fort
garden
and
its
dependent
works
moreover
he
must
keep
a
force
beyond
the
segre
to
block
the
and
this
force
must
be
a
large
one
because
the
east
was
the
quarter
from
which
succours
sent
from
catalonia
must
certainly
appear
the
garrison
on
the
other
hand
was
quite
adequate
to
man
the
works
entrusted
to
it
the
entry
into
the
town
of
perena
s
aragonese
battalions
had
brought
it
up
to
a
strength
of
over
men
the
artillery
were
the
weak
point
there
were
only
trained
men
to
man
over
pieces
the
governor
was
garcia
conde
who
owed
his
promotion
to
his
brilliant
achievements
at
gerona
in
the
preceding
september
suchet
s
men
were
insufficient
for
a
close
and
thorough
investment
of
such
a
large
space
as
that
covered
by
the
fortifications
he
was
forced
to
leave
a
considerable
part
of
its
southern
front
watched
by
cavalry
posts
alone
of
his
total
force
musnier
with
six
battalions
and
the
greater
part
of
the
cavalry
about
men
in
all
was
beyond
the
river
three
battalions
blocked
the
the
rest
formed
a
sort
of
covering
force
destined
to
keep
off
the
approach
of
enemies
from
the
side
of
catalonia
on
the
hither
side
of
the
segre
the
three
brigades
of
habert
buget
and
vergès
were
encamped
facing
the
western
and
fronts
of
lerida
they
counted
only
thirteen
battalions
being
weakened
by
men
who
had
been
detached
to
garrison
monzon
and
fraga
the
communication
between
musnier
s
division
and
the
rest
of
the
army
was
by
a
flying
bridge
thrown
across
the
segre
two
miles
above
the
town
it
was
guarded
by
a
redoubt
the
artillery
park
was
placed
at
the
village
of
san
rufo
opposite
the
angle
of
the
town
from
which
it
is
distant
about
yards
it
was
evident
from
the
first
that
this
would
be
the
point
of
attack
selected
by
the
french
engineers
the
army
had
barely
taken
up
its
position
when
on
april
rumours
were
spread
abroad
that
o
donnell
was
on
his
way
to
relieve
lerida
they
must
have
been
pure
guesses
for
the
spanish
general
on
that
day
was
still
at
tarragona
and
had
made
no
movement
they
were
however
sufficiently
persistent
to
induce
suchet
to
take
off
musnier
s
covering
corps
strengthened
by
three
other
battalions
on
a
mission
of
exploration
almost
as
far
as
tarrega
on
the
barcelona
road
no
spanish
force
was
met
nor
could
any
information
be
extracted
from
the
inhabitants
the
absence
of
the
troops
on
the
left
bank
of
the
segre
was
soon
detected
by
garcia
conde
who
to
his
great
regret
three
days
later
sent
messengers
to
inform
o
donnell
that
the
french
lines
to
the
east
of
the
city
were
now
almost
unoccupied
the
fiery
o
donnell
was
already
on
his
way
when
this
news
reached
him
the
moment
that
he
was
sure
that
augereau
had
left
barcelona
and
was
retreating
northward
he
had
resolved
to
fly
to
the
relief
of
lerida
with
the
two
divisions
of
which
he
could
dispose
on
the
twentieth
he
marched
from
tarragona
by
valls
and
momblanch
with
regular
infantry
horse
a
single
battery
and
some
miqueletes
on
the
he
had
reached
juneda
twelve
miles
from
lerida
without
having
seen
a
french
picket
or
having
been
detected
himself
he
intended
to
drive
off
the
few
battalions
blocking
the
and
to
open
up
communication
with
the
besieged
town
that
same
day
unfortunately
for
him
suchet
and
musnier
had
returned
on
the
previous
night
from
their
expedition
to
tarrega
and
were
now
lying
at
alcoletge
three
miles
north
of
the
with
seven
battalions
and
cuirassiers
pushing
briskly
forward
along
the
in
a
level
treeless
plateau
destitute
of
cover
of
any
kind
the
leading
spanish
division
that
of
ibarrola
came
into
contact
about
midday
with
the
small
force
guarding
the
which
was
now
in
charge
of
harispe
suchet
s
to
the
surprise
of
the
spaniards
who
had
expected
to
see
these
three
battalions
and
two
squadrons
of
hussars
retire
in
haste
the
french
showed
fight
harispe
was
aware
that
musnier
could
come
up
to
his
aid
within
an
hour
and
was
ready
for
battle
his
hussars
charged
the
leading
regiment
of
ibarrola
s
column
and
threw
it
into
disorder
while
his
infantry
formed
up
in
support
at
this
moment
the
spanish
general
received
news
that
musnier
was
moving
in
towards
his
flank
he
therefore
retired
to
get
the
support
of
o
donnell
who
was
following
him
with
the
second
division
but
at
the
ruined
village
of
margalef
six
miles
from
lerida
the
column
of
musnier
came
up
with
ibarrola
and
he
was
so
hard
pressed
that
he
formed
line
with
cavalry
on
his
right
wing
and
his
three
guns
on
his
left
the
position
was
as
bad
a
one
as
could
be
found
for
the
spanish
division
a
dead
flat
with
no
cover
musnier
on
reaching
the
front
flung
his
cavalry
cuirassiers
of
the
regiment
at
the
spanish
right
wing
the
horsemen
placed
there
broke
and
fled
without
crossing
sabres
and
the
french
charge
fell
on
the
flank
battalion
of
the
infantry
which
was
caught
while
vainly
trying
to
form
square
it
was
ridden
down
in
a
moment
and
the
horsemen
then
rolled
up
the
whole
line
regiment
after
regiment
a
great
part
of
ibarrola
s
corps
was
captured
and
o
donnell
who
came
on
the
field
with
the
division
of
pirez
just
as
the
disaster
took
place
could
do
no
more
than
retire
in
good
order
covering
the
scattered
remnants
of
his
front
line
a
swiss
battalion
which
he
told
off
as
his
rearguard
was
pierced
by
the
cuirassiers
and
for
the
most
part
captured
in
this
disastrous
affair
the
spaniards
lost
killed
and
wounded
and
several
thousand
prisoners
as
also
four
flags
and
the
belonging
to
ibarrola
s
division
the
french
of
whom
the
cavalry
alone
were
seriously
engaged
are
said
by
suchet
to
have
had
no
more
than
killed
and
wounded
suchet
says
that
he
took
prisoners
a
figure
that
appears
quite
impossible
as
schepeler
rightly
remarks
iii
ibarrola
s
division
had
only
bayonets
and
of
that
of
pirez
only
the
one
swiss
battalion
was
seriously
engaged
moreover
ibarrola
s
division
was
not
absolutely
exterminated

on
april
issued
an
order
of
the
day
in
which
he
thanks
the
division
for
its
courage
and
praises
the
battalions
which
kept
their
ranks
and
behind
those
of
pirez
returning
in
good
order
to
occupy
the

which
they
had
started
at

i
should
doubt
if
prisoners
were
not
nearer
the
mark
than
figures
probably
correct
martinien
s
lists
show
one
officer
killed
and
two
wounded
of
the
latter
one
was
the
cavalry
general
boussard
it
is
clear
that
o
donnell
must
take
the
blame
for
the
ruin
that
fell
upon
his
little
field
army
he
should
not
have
been
caught
with
his
two
divisions
marching
with
an
interval
of
four
miles
between
them
nor
ought
he
to
have
been
ignorant
of
the
return
of
musnier
s
force
considering
that
he
had
cavalry
who
should
have
been
exploring
the
whole
for
miles
around
instead
of
riding
in
a
mass
along
with
ibarrola
s
infantry
the
carelessness
shown
was
unpardonable
relying
apparently
on
garcia
conde
s
dispatch
now
two
days
old
concerning
the
weakness
of
the
french
beyond
the
segre
the
spanish
general
was
caught
moving
as
if
for
an
unopposed
entry
into
lerida
instead
of
in
battle
order
it
may
be
added
that
he
would
have
done
well
to
collect
more
men
before
advancing
against
suchet
bayonets
and
sabres
were
too
small
a
force
to
tackle
the
main
body
of
the
corps
even
if
they
were
aided
by
a
sortie
from
lerida
as
o
donnell
had
intended
it
would
have
been
well
to
make
some
endeavour
to
get
troops
from
the
valencian
army
whose
men
were
absolutely
idle
at
the
moment
it
is
true
that
josé
caro
and
the
valencian
junta
were
very
chary
of
sending
their
men
outside
their
own
border
but
for
such
a
great
affair
as
the
relief
of
lerida
a
brigade
or
two
might
have
been
borrowed
there
was
a
considerable
valencian
force
at
the
moment
in
the
neighbourhood
of
alcañiz
after
the
combat
of
margalef
suchet
summoned
lerida
for
a
second
time
and
offered
to
allow
the
governor
to
see
the
prisoners
and
guns
which
he
had
taken
from
o
donnell
garcia
conde
very
rightly
answered
that
he
relied
on
his
own
forces
alone
and
should
fight
to
the
end
accordingly
the
regular
siege
began
the
trenches
were
opened
opposite
the
north
front
of
the
town
on
april
several
days
of
heavy
rain
hindered
the
completion
of
the
first
parallel
but
on
may
the
breaching
batteries
were
ready
and
the
bombardment
began
the
front
attacked
the
carmen
and
magdalena
bastions
was
weak
it
was
not
protected
by
any
flanking
fires
and
had
neither
a
ditch
nor
a
covered
way
it
was
bound
to
succumb
before
the
very
heavy
fire
directed
against
it
unless
the
defence
should
succeed
in
beating
down
the
fire
of
the
breaching
batteries
the
spaniards
did
their
best
bringing
up
every
gun
that
could
be
mounted
and
replacing
each
injured
piece
as
it
was
disabled
but
the
end
was
obvious
from
the
first
the
walls
were
not
strong
enough
to
resist
the
attack
meanwhile
suchet
made
two
successive
assaults
on
a
part
of
the
defences
very
far
distant
from
the
main
front
of
attack
the
two
isolated
redoubts
which
stood
on
the
south
end
of
the
extramural
plateau
of
which
fort
garden
formed
the
main
protection
he
wished
to
gain
a
footing
on
this
high
ground
both
because
he
could
from
thence
molest
the
south
front
of
the
town
and
because
he
wished
to
prevent
the
spaniards
from
using
the
plateau
as
a
place
of
refuge
after
the
fall
of
the
city
which
he
regarded
as
inevitable
the
first
attempt
to
take
the
works
by
escalade
on
the
night
of
april
was
a
disastrous
failure
the
pilar
was
occupied
for
a
moment
but
the
attack
on
san
fernando
failed
and
the
dominating
fire
from
it
drove
the
stormers
out
of
the
smaller
work
after
they
had
held
it
for
a
few
hours
the
second
escalade
was
more
successful
it
was
carried
out
on
the
night
of
may
and
ended
in
the
storming
of
both
works
only
a
small
part
of
their
garrison
succeeded
in
escaping
into
fort
garden
the
besieged
lost
men
the
successful
assailants
only
the
greater
part
of
the
plateau
was
now
in
the
hands
of
the
french
on
the
next
day
may
the
engineers
announced
that
the
two
breaches
in
the
north
front
of
the
town
walls
were
practicable
and
that
same
evening
lerida
was
stormed
the
breaches
were
carried
with
no
great
difficulty
but
the
garrison
made
a
stubborn
resistance
for
some
time
behind
traverses
and
fortified
houses
in
the
rear
of
them
when
these
were
carried
the
city
was
at
suchet
s
mercy
but
it
was
not
at
the
city
alone
that
he
was
aiming
he
wished
to
master
the
citadel
also
during
the
last
siege
of
lerida
that
by
the
duke
of
orleans
in
the
castle
had
held
out
for
many
days
after
the
town
had
been
lost
suchet
s
way
of
securing
his
end
was
effective
but
brutal
on
the
whole
it
was
the
greatest
atrocity
perpetrated
by
any
combatant
french
spanish
or
english
during
the
whole
peninsular
war
when
his
troops
had
entered
the
streets
he
directed
columns
towards
each
gate
and
having
secured
possession
of
them
all
so
as
to
make
escape
into
the
open
country
impossible
bade
his
troops
push
the
whole
population
of
lerida
uphill
into
the
citadel
where
the
beaten
garrison
was
already
taking
refuge
the
soldiery
as
he
writes
with
evident
complacency
and
pride
in
his
ingenuity
were
set
in
a
concentric
movement
to
push
the
inhabitants
along
with
the
garrison
towards
the
upper
streets
and
the
citadel
they
were
dislodged
by
musketry
fire
from
street
after
street
house
after
house
in
order
to
force
them
into
the
castle
that
work
was
still
firing
and
its
discharges
augmented
the
danger
and
the
panic
of
the
civil
population
as
they
were
thrust
along
with
the
wreck
of
the
garrison
into
the
ditch
and
over
the
drawbridge
pressed
on
by
our
soldiers
they
hastily
poured
into
the
castle
yard
before
the
governor
had
time
to
order
that
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
the
castle
being
crammed
with
some
fifteen
thousand
men
women
and
children
suchet
gave
orders
to
bombard
it
with
every
available
mortar
and
howitzer
every
shell
he
writes
that
fell
into
the
narrow
space
containing
this
multitude
fell
on
serried
masses
of
no
less
than
of
soldiery
it
had
been
calculated
that
the
governor
and
the
most
determined
officers
would
be
influenced
by
the
presence
of
these
women
children
old
folk
and
unarmed
peasants
as
general
suchet
had
flattered
himself
would
be
the
case
the
scheme
had
a
prompt
and
decisive
on
the
at
midday
garcia
conde
unable
to
stand
the
slaughter
any
longer
hoisted
the
white
flag
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
the
forcing
of
thousands
of
by
means
of
musketry
fire
on
to
the
front
of
the
enemy
s
line
of
defence
differs
in
any
way
from
the
device
not
unknown
among
african
savages
and
red
indians
of
attacking
under
cover
of
captured
women
and
children
thrust
in
upon
the
weapons
of
their
fathers
and
husbands
the
act
places
that
polished
writer
and
able
administrator
suchet
on
the
moral
level
of
a
king
of
dahomey
he
acknowledges
that
the
plan
was
deliberately
thought
out
and
that
scores
of
his
victims
perished
not
in
the
subsequent
bombardment
but
by
being
shot
down
by
his
own
men
while
the
crowd
was
being
collected
and
hunted
forward
historians
have
denounced
the
atrocities
committed
by
the
french
rank
and
file
at
tarragona
or
oporto
by
the
english
rank
and
file
at
badajoz
or
sebastian
but
the
cultured
general
who
worked
out
this
most
effective
plan
for
the
reduction
of
a
hostile
citadel
has
never
had
his
due
meed
of
shame
napier
s
remark
that
though
a
town
taken
by
assault
is
considered
the
lawful
prey
of
a
licentious
soldiery
yet
this
remnant
of
barbarism
does
not
warrant
the
driving
of
unarmed
and
helpless
people
into
a
situation
where
they
must
perish
seems
a
sufficiently
mild
censure
when
all
the
circumstances
are
taken
into
account
one
or
two
cases
can
also
be
quoted
from
the
european
middle
ages
suchet
pp
napier
ii
the
total
number
of
spanish
troops
surrendered
by
garcia
conde
in
the
citadel
and
fort
garden
or
captured
by
the
french
during
the
storm
amounted
to
over
men
of
whom
about
were
wounded
lying
in
the
hospital
it
was
calculated
that
or
more
had
perished
during
the
siege
and
that
about
of
the
civil
population
had
fallen
victims
to
suchet
s
barbarous
device
the
french
losses
during
the
whole
series
of
operations
had
been
killed
and
wounded
the
spaniards
declared
that
garcia
conde
had
betrayed
lerida
and
ought
never
to
have
surrendered
but
the
only
ground
for
this
accusation
was
that
after
a
short
captivity
he
did
homage
to
king
joseph
and
became
an
though
he
had
shown
dash
and
courage
at
gerona
it
is
clear
that
he
lacked
the
firmness
of
governors
such
as
mariano
alvarez
or
andrés
herrasti
his
defence
of
lerida
had
not
been
particularly
skilful
nor
particularly
resolute
with
over
men
within
the
walls
he
ought
to
have
been
able
to
hold
out
longer
against
suchet
s
the
most
blameworthy
part
of
his
arrangements
was
his
neglect
to
retrench
the
breaches
and
to
form
a
strong
second
line
of
temporary
works
behind
them
alvarez
under
similar
conditions
and
with
a
garrison
far
less
strong
in
comparison
to
the
besieging
army
held
out
for
months
after
his
walls
had
been
breached
simply
because
he
treated
them
only
as
an
outer
line
of
resistance
and
was
prepared
to
fight
on
behind
his
inner
defences
after
the
fall
of
lerida
suchet
having
received
through
france
the
news
that
the
whole
of
augereau
s
army
was
collected
in
the
neighbourhood
of
hostalrich
and
gerona
made
up
his
mind
that
he
had
better
attempt
nothing
ambitious
until
the
corps
was
in
a
position
to
help
him
but
there
was
a
small
task
close
to
his
hand
which
was
well
worth
undertaking
in
a
moment
of
enforced
leisure
this
was
the
siege
of
mequinenza
the
only
fortress
left
in
spanish
hands
on
the
eastern
side
of
aragon
it
was
a
small
place
but
not
without
its
strategic
importance
for
not
only
did
it
cover
the
junction
of
the
segre
and
the
ebro
but
it
was
the
highest
point
open
for
navigation
on
the
river
any
one
holding
mequinenza
can
use
the
ebro
as
a
except
in
times
of
drought
and
this
was
an
advantage
of
no
small
importance
since
the
country
from
thence
to
the
sea
chances
to
be
singularly
destitute
of
roads
of
any
kind
a
few
months
later
suchet
found
the
place
invaluable
as
he
was
able
to
prepare
his
for
the
siege
of
tortosa
within
its
walls
and
then
to
send
all
the
heavy
material
with
the
minimum
of
trouble
mequinenza
was
a
small
place
consisting
of
a
few
hundred
houses
along
the
river
bank
enclosed
by
a
weak
and
wall
but
dominated
by
a
strong
castle
which
towers
feet
above
the
water
at
the
end
of
a
spur
of
the
sierra
de
montenegre
the
garrison
consisted
of
about
men
under
a
colonel
carbon
the
very
day
after
lerida
had
fallen
suchet
sent
a
brigade
to
invest
mequinenza
more
troops
followed
after
an
interval
it
was
clear
that
the
taking
of
the
town
would
offer
small
difficulty
but
the
castle
was
another
matter
its
defences
were
independent
of
those
of
the
place
below
and
its
site
was
so
lofty
and
rocky
that
it
could
not
be
battered
from
any
ground
accessible
by
existing
roads
indeed
it
could
only
be
approached
along
the
crest
of
the
sierra
of
which
it
forms
the
last
lofty
point
the
main
interest
of
the
siege
of
mequinenza
lies
in
the
fact
that
in
order
to
reduce
the
castle
the
french
engineers
had
to
build
a
road
practicable
for
heavy
guns
in
up
the
side
of
the
sierra
they
had
arrived
in
front
of
the
place
on
may
by
june
the
road
was
completed
it
was
a
piece
of
hard
work
as
in
order
to
utilize
the
easiest
possible
slopes
it
had
been
made
no
less
than
five
miles
long
but
when
the
guns
had
once
been
got
up
on
to
the
crest
of
the
mountain
mequinenza
town
and
castle
alike
was
doomed
the
town
was
stormed
on
june
it
might
have
been
captured
long
before
but
there
was
little
use
in
taking
possession
of
it
until
the
attack
upon
the
castle
had
been
begun
before
the
storm
colonel
carbon
had
wisely
ordered
all
the
large
river
craft
in
the
place
eleven
in
number
to
run
to
tortosa
he
was
well
aware
that
suchet
wanted
to
open
up
the
navigation
of
the
ebro
and
was
resolved
that
he
should
find
no
vessels
ready
for
him
two
of
the
craft
ran
ashore
and
were
captured
the
other
nine
got
off
clear
when
the
three
batteries
erected
on
the
summit
of
the
sierra
opened
on
the
castle
the
walls
began
to
crumble
at
once
at
the
end
of
eight
days
its
front
towards
the
french
trenches
was
a
mass
of
shapeless
ruins
carbon
then
surrendered
without
waiting
for
an
assault
which
must
undoubtedly
have
proved
successful
there
was
nothing
particularly
obstinate
or
on
the
other
hand
particularly
discreditable
in
the
defence
the
castle
was
not
a
modern
fortress
its
sole
strength
had
lain
in
its
inaccessible
position
and
when
the
french
had
climbed
up
on
to
a
level
with
it
nothing
more
could
be
done
having
mastered
lerida
and
mequinenza
and
obtained
a
firm
footing
in
the
plain
of
western
catalonia
suchet
had
now
harder
work
before
him
his
first
necessity
was
to
clear
the
country
behind
him
of
the
insurgents
who
had
swarmed
down
from
the
hills
to
attack
the
troops
left
behind
in
central
aragon
while
the
main
army
had
been
concentrated
before
lerida
villacampa
had
half
destroyed
a
column
of
men
at
arandija
on
the
xalon
on
may
catalan
somatenes
had
attacked
the
garrison
of
the
valley
of
venasque
on
the
very
frontier
of
france
on
may
valencian
bands
had
besieged
the
castle
of
alcañiz
for
many
days
but
all
the
enemies
of
suchet
had
to
fly
as
soon
as
his
main
army
became
once
more
free
for
field
service
no
attempt
was
made
to
oppose
a
serious
resistance
to
his
movable
columns
the
insurgents
fled
to
right
and
left
the
most
extraordinary
proof
of
their
demoralization
was
that
on
june
general
montmarie
at
the
head
of
one
of
these
columns
found
the
strong
fort
of
morella
within
the
valencian
border
absolutely
unoccupied
he
seized
and
garrisoned
it
knowing
that
this
place
which
commands
the
from
aragon
to
valencia
was
of
immense
strategical
importance
when
june
came
round
suchet
had
once
more
mastered
all
aragon
and
was
free
for
work
outside
its
borders
a
march
against
valencia
on
the
one
side
or
against
tortosa
and
tarragona
on
the
other
was
equally
possible
but
at
this
moment
napoleon
was
set
on
proceeding
methodically
in
eastern
spain
no
less
than
in
portugal
and
the
orders
issued
to
the
commander
of
the
corps
were
to
proceed
against
tortosa
and
cut
off
valencia
from
catalonia
by
its
capture
the
longer
and
more
difficult
advance
against
valencia
itself
was
relegated
to
a
distant
date
there
must
be
no
more
fiascos
like
that
of
february
accordingly
suchet
was
ordered
to
follow
up
the
capture
of
lerida
and
mequinenza
by
the
reduction
of
tortosa
he
was
informed
at
the
same
time
that
macdonald
the
new
commander
of
the
army
of
catalonia
was
ordered
to
attack
tarragona
in
this
way
the
restless
o
donnell
would
find
his
hands
full
at
home
and
would
not
be
able
to
spare
time
or
men
for
the
relief
of
tortosa
only
from
the
valencian
army
which
had
always
been
badly
led
and
managed
with
the
most
narrow
particularism
by
josé
caro
and
his
junta
need
suchet
expect
any
trouble
napoleon
to
berthier
may
but
until
macdonald
was
prepared
to
lead
down
his
corps
to
the
neighbourhood
of
tarragona
and
the
lower
ebro
suchet
felt
that
his
own
enterprise
must
be
held
back
or
at
least
conducted
with
caution
and
although
macdonald
had
received
his
orders
in
may
on
taking
over
augereau
s
post
it
was
some
time
before
he
was
able
to
execute
them
june
and
july
had
passed
and
august
had
arrived
before
he
appeared
in
the
regions
where
suchet
had
been
told
to
expect
him
and
at
last
placed
himself
in
communication
with
the
army
of
aragon
this
long
delay
was
entirely
due
to
the
burden
imposed
upon
him
by
the
necessities
of
barcelona
with
its
large
garrison
and
its
vast
civil
population
the
provisions
which
augereau
had
introduced
into
the
city
in
the
early
spring
were
exhausted
and
his
successor
was
forced
to
replace
them
by
escorting
thither
two
new
convoys
of
great
size
in
june
and
july
so
active
were
the
miqueletes
that
macdonald
found
himself
obliged
to
take
with
him
his
french
and
his
italian
division
as
escort
on
each
occasion
for
a
convoy
is
a
vast
affair
stretching
out
to
long
miles
in
a
mountain
country
and
requiring
to
be
strongly
guarded
at
every
point
of
its
unwieldy
length
the
emperor
was
bitterly
disappointed
at
macdonald
s
delays
it
was
hard
to
convince
him
that
the
problem
of
in
catalonia
was
almost
insoluble
and
that
neither
barcelona
nor
the
field
army
could
be
permanently
fed
by
seizing
the
resources
of
the
valley
of
the
llobregat
or
the
campo
of
tarragona
and
making
war
support
war
in
the
regular
style
catalonia
had
never
fed
its
whole
population
even
in
time
of
peace
but
had
largely
depended
on
corn
brought
up
from
aragon
or
imported
by
sea
but
the
british
mediterranean
squadron
now
made
the
transport
of
food
to
barcelona
by
water
impossible
while
till
the
corps
and
the
corps
should
finally
meet
it
was
impossible
to
supply
the
latter
from
the
aragonese
base
while
neither
of
the
normal
ways
of
procuring
a
regular
supply
of
provisions
was
practicable
nothing
remained
but
the
weary
task
of
escorting
convoys
from
perpignan
and
figueras
to
barcelona
this
macdonald
accomplished
thrice
in
june
july
and
august
it
was
only
after
the
third
journey
that
he
left
the
storeshouses
of
barcelona
so
thoroughly
replenished
that
he
was
able
to
think
of
further
offensive
operations
and
to
concert
the
junction
with
suchet
and
the
corps
the
marshal
in
his
autobiography
confesses
that
he
hated
the
task
set
him
and
found
it
entirely
out
of
the
lines
of
his
experience
he
began
his
career
by
repealing
augereau
s
hanging
edicts
and
endeavoured
to
introduce
more
humane
methods
of
warfare
but
his
own
men
were
out
of
hand
and
the
spaniards
being
as
fierce
as
ever
his
task
was
a
very
hard
one
meanwhile
henry
o
donnell
was
granted
three
months
in
which
to
reorganize
the
catalan
army
which
had
suffered
so
severely
at
margalef
his
untiring
energy
enabled
him
to
raise
his
force
by
the
end
of
july
to
men
organized
in
five
divisions
with
which
he
formed
a
double
front
facing
suchet
on
the
west
and
macdonald
on
the
east
one
division
under
campo
verde
lay
northward
in
the
mountains
with
head
quarters
at
cardona
and
detachments
pushed
forward
as
far
as
urgel
and
olot
its
main
task
was
to
harass
the
french
garrison
of
the
ampurdam
and
to
threaten
macdonald
s
rear
every
time
that
he
moved
forward
towards
barcelona
a
second
division
lay
facing
that
city
on
the
lower
llobregat
with
detachments
at
montserrat
and
manresa
which
kept
up
the
communications
with
campo
verde
and
the
north
two
more
divisions
lay
westward
in
the
direction
of
falcet
and
borja
blanca
watching
suchet
and
prepared
to
oppose
any
serious
attempt
on
his
part
to
close
in
upon
tortosa
the
fifth
division
or
reserve
formed
a
central
mass
of
troops
ready
to
reinforce
either
the
detachments
which
watched
suchet
or
those
which
watched
macdonald
it
lay
south
of
tarragona
at
the
col
de
alba
thus
posted
o
donnell
waited
for
further
developments
and
continued
to
drill
and
exercise
his
new
levies
to
dismiss
inactive
and
incompetent
officers
to
collect
magazines
and
to
quarrel
with
the
local
junta
for
this
active
and
intelligent
if
reckless
and
young
officer
was
on
even
worse
terms
with
the
catalan
authorities
than
his
predecessor
blake
the
main
cause
of
quarrel
was
that
o
donnell
wished
to
strengthen
his
regular
troops
by
drafting
into
the
depleted
of
reding
s
and
coupigny
s
old
battalions
every
recruit
that
he
could
catch
he
held
that
the
french
could
only
be
brought
to
a
final
check
by
disciplined
troops
the
junta
on
the
other
hand
believed
in
guerrilla
warfare
and
preferred
to
call
out
from
time
to
time
the
miqueletes
and
somatenes
who
drifted
back
to
their
homes
whenever
a
crisis
was
over
both
sides
had
much
to
say
for
themselves
the
catalans
could
point
out
that
the
regular
troops
had
been
beaten
times
out
of
number
while
their
own
irregulars
had
achieved
many
small
successes
and
done
the
french
much
harm
o
donnell
on
the
other
hand
was
quite
right
in
holding
that
guerrilla
operations
much
as
they
might
incommode
the
enemy
would
never
deal
him
a
fatal
blow
or
finish
the
war
he
dreamed
of
recruiting
his
army
up
to
a
force
of
men
at
some
happy
future
date
and
of
delivering
a
stroke
with
superior
numbers
which
should
destroy
the
french
hold
on
catalonia
meanwhile
much
as
they
quarrelled
the
general
and
the
local
junta
were
both
too
good
haters
of
france
to
allow
their
disputes
to
prevent
a
vigorous
resistance
from
being
kept
up
in
the
principality
o
donnell
carried
his
point
to
the
extent
of
persuading
the
junta
to
allow
him
to
form
many
of
the
tercios
of
miqueletes
into
legions
which
were
to
be
kept
permanently
embodied
and
to
count
as
part
of
the
regular
army
hence
came
the
large
rise
in
his
to
please
the
catalans
who
hated
the
idea
of
long
service
the
enlistment
in
the
legions
was
made
for
two
years
only
and
the
men
were
to
be
entitled
to
fifteen
days
leave

so
great

to

his
brother
usually
supported
the
marshal
it
was
napoleon
s
first
maxim
that
war
should
maintain
war
and
he
thought
it
of
far
more
importance
that
the
army
of
andalusia
should
pay
for
itself
than
that
the
bankrupt
exchequer
at

should
be
recruited

rolled

realized

selfish
game

any
particular
refusal
to
fall
in
with
the

plans

to
obey
his
orders
in
his
conduct
may
be
justified
but
in

he
undoubtedly
as
will
be
shown
in
chapters
to
come
ruined
what
small
chance
there
was
of
bringing
the
peninsular
war
to
a
successful
termination
by
pursuing

policy
which
made
the

the
lesson
which
he
had
received
after

vain
attempt
to
create

of

had
not

ambitions
were
as

as

him
the

or
disobeyed

not

his

to
a
great
extent
he
justified
his
policy
by
success
the
of
andalusia
was
undoubtedly
the
part
of
the
french
holding
in
spain
where
the
administration
was
most
successful
and
the
occupation
most
thorough
soult
not
only
built
up
but
kept
together
an
party
among
the
local
population
which
was
stronger
and
more
compact
than
in
any
other
part
of
the
peninsula
he
even
succeeded
in
raising
a
small
permanent
force
of
spanish
auxiliaries
which
was
decidedly
more
trustworthy
and
less
given
to
desertion
than
the
regiments
of
the
same
class
which
king
joseph
was
perpetually
creating
in
madrid
only
to
see
them
crumble
away
under
his
hand
the
army
of
andalusia
was
strengthened
by
two
regiments
of
chasseurs
à
cheval
which
were
attached
to
the
corps
and
some
free
companies
of
infantry
which
were
used
for
garrison
and
blockhouse
work
but
it
was
far
more
important
that
soult
succeeded
in
enlisting
many
battalions
of
a
sort
of
national
guard
which
he
called
fusiliers
with
them
he
kept
the
peace
of
the
larger
towns
such
as

cordova
and
jaen
the
very
existence
of
such
a
force
which
king
joseph
had
vainly
attempted
to
establish
in
madrid
was
of
evil
omen
for
the
patriotic
cause
in
andalusia
on
several
occasions
they
fought
well
against
the
guerrilleros
when
the
latter
attempted

well
aware

if

were

an
evil
fate
would
await
him
having
once
committed
himself
to
the
french
side
he
was
forced
to
defend
his
own
neck
from
the
gallows
there
was
desperate
quarrelling
with
madrid
when
soult
tried
to
get
hold
of
the
small
as
these
were
owing
to
the
english
blockade
and
when

soult

was
conducted
with
a
far
greater
decency
than
that
of
duhesme
kellermann
and
other
noted
plunderers
among
the
french
governors
but
it
involved
nevertheless
a
considerable
amount
of
more
or
less
open
spoliation
the
marshal

own
hands
were
not
quite
clean
his
collection
of
the

the
pride
of

on

undisguised

was
much
maligned
by
his
own
compatriots
no
less
than
by
the
spaniards
hard
cash
as
well
as
pictures
did
not
come
amiss
to
him
but
his
exactions
were
moderate
compared
with
those
of
some
of
his
subordinates
though
mortier
and
dessolles
had
good
reputations
sebastiani

an
infamous
one

perreymond

shot
himself
early
in
when
called
to
face
a
commission
of
inquiry
and
certain
other
generals
have
very
black
marks
against
them
still
the
machine
of
government
worked
if
not
without
friction
at
least
with
an
efficiency
that
contrasted
favourably
with
the
administration
of
any
other
province
of
spain
save
suchet
s
domain
of
aragon
cf
observations
by
his
chamans
in
his
pp
as
to
the
marshal
s
administration
it
may
serve
as
an
example
of
the
liberal
way
in
which
the
superior
officers
were
allowed
to
draw
in
money
that
soult
gave
his
francs
a
month
when
he
was
commanding
in
the
town
of
carmona
besides
his
pay
and
free
food
and
quarters
it
is
small
wonder
that
he
and
other
governors
began
as
he
said
à
trancher
du
grand
cf
arteche
viii
for
spanish
views
on
soult
s
administration
but
it
was
only
the
valley
of
the
guadalquivir
which
lay
subdued
beneath
the
feet
of
soult
cadiz
and
the
mountains
had
yet
to
be
dealt
with
and
as
the
months
went
on
the
difficulties
of
the
french
army
of
andalusia
became
more
and
more
evident
it
was
only
by
degrees
that
the
french
generals
came
to
comprehend
the
absolute
impregnability
of
cadiz
and
the
advantage
that
the
possession
of
the
and
the
fleet
depending
on
it
gave
to
the
spaniards
in
the
first
months
of
the
siege
victor
s
engineers
and
artillerists
had
flattered
themselves
that
something
might
be
done
to
molest
the
place
if
not
to
reduce
it
to
surrender
by
pushing
batteries
forward
to
the
extreme
front
of
the
ground
in
their
possession
all
around
the
harbour
within
the
first
weeks
of
his
arrival
in
front
of
cadiz
victor
made
an
attempt
to
push
forward
his
posts
along
the
which
crosses
the
broad
of
the
santi
petri
but
the
bogs
and
were
found
impracticable
and
the
spanish
works
in
front
of
the
bridge
of
zuazo
too
strong
to
be
attacked
along
the
narrow
causeway
the
french
drew
back
to
chiclana
which
became
the
head
quarters
of
the
left
wing
of
the
blockading
force
and
where
ruffin
s
division
was
permanently
encamped
it
was
then
thought
that
something
might
be
accomplished
further
to
the
north
by
working
against
the
arsenal
of
la
carraca
at
the
one
end
of
the
spanish
line
or
the
projecting
castle
of
puntales
at
the
other
the
struggle
for
the
points
of
vantage
from
which
puntales
could
be
battered
formed
the
chief
point
of
interest
during
the
early
months
of
the
siege
the
french
pushing
down
from
the
mainland
on
to
the
peninsula
of
the
trocadero
began
to
erect
works
on
the
ground
most
favourable
for
attacking
the
fort
of
matagorda
which
had
once
more
become
the
outermost
bulwark
of
cadiz
there
was
a
bitter
fight
over
this
work
which
stands
on
the
tidal
flats
below
the
trocadero
surrounded
by
mud
for
one
half
of
the
day
and
by
water
for
the
other
it
will
be
remembered
that
matagorda
had
been
blown
up
at
the
time
of
the
first
arrival
of
the
french
before
cadiz
but
after
a
few
days
of
reflection
the
english
and
spanish
engineer
officers
in
command
of
the
defence
grew
uneasy
as
to
the
possibilities
of
mischief
which
might
follow
from
the
seizure
of
the
ruined
fort
by
the
enemy
their
fears
as
it
afterwards
turned
out
were
unnecessary
but
they
led
to
the
reoccupation
of
matagorda
on
february
by
a
detachment
of
british
artillery
supported
by
a
company
of
the
regiment
the
front
of
the
work
facing
toward
the
mainland
was
hastily
repaired
and
heavy
guns
brought
over
the
harbour
from
cadiz
were
mounted
on
it
moreover
it
was
arranged
that
it
should
be
supported
by
a
spanish
and
some
gunboats
as
far
as
the
mud
banks
permitted
victor
took
the
reoccupation
of
the
fort
as
a
challenge
and
thought
that
the
allies
must
have
good
reasons
for
attaching
so
much
importance
to
it
accordingly
he
multiplied
his
batteries
on
the
trocadero
till
he
had
got
forty
guns
mounted
in
a
dominating
position
with
which
to
overwhelm
the
garrison
in
their
stronghold
there
was
a
long
and
fierce
artillery
contest
but
the
french
had
the
advantage
both
in
the
number
of
guns
and
in
the
concentric
fire
which
they
could
pour
upon
the
fort
the
naval
help
promised
to
matagorda
proved
of
little
assistance
partly
owing
to
the
impracticability
of
the
mud
flats
when
the
tide
was
out
partly
because
the
gunboats
could
not
endure
the
fire
of
the
french
heavy
artillery
on
april
general
graham
who
had
arrived
at
cadiz
and
taken
command
of
the
british
forces
over
the
head
of
general
stewart
ordered
matagorda
to
be
evacuated
it
was
high
time
for
the
fort
was
shot
to
pieces
and
men
out
of
a
garrison
of
had
been
killed
or
wounded
the
enemy
took
possession
of
the
ruins
and
rebuilt
and
rearmed
the
fort
they
also
the
ruined
forts
of
san
luis
and
san
josé
on
the
firm
ground
facing
matagorda
to
which
they
had
not
possessed
a
safe
access
till
the
outer
work
in
the
mud
had
been
captured
these
were
the
most
advanced
points
toward
cadiz
which
the
french
could
hold
and
here
they
mounted
their
heaviest
guns
in
the
hope
of
demolishing
the
castle
of
puntales
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
and
of
making
the
inner
harbour
useless
for
shipping
their
purpose
was
only
partly
accomplished
the
ships
it
is
true
had
to
move
east
or
west
into
the
outer
harbour
or
nearer
to
the
carraca
and
the
isla
de
leon
but
puntales
was
never
seriously
injured
and
maintained
an
intermittent
artillery
duel
with
matagorda
across
the
strait
as
long
as
the
siege
lasted
the
occasional
bombs
that
fell
beyond
puntales
in
the
direction
of
the
cortadura
did
not
seriously
incommode
the
garrison
and
ships
could
always
pass
the
strait
between
the
two
forts
at
night
without
appreciable
risk
later
on
soult
caused
mortars
of
unprecedented
dimensions
to
be
cast
in
the
arsenal
of
seville
on
the
designs
presented
to
him
by
an
artillery
officer
of
the
name
of
villantroys
but
even
when
these
had
been
mounted
on
matagorda
no
great
damage
was
done
one
bomb
only
as
a
spanish
popular
song
recorded
ever
touched
cadiz
town
and
that
only
killed
a
street
dog
there
is
a
good
account
of
the
desperate
life
of

introduced
under

after
the
fall
of
matagorda
the
next
most
notable
event
of
the
spring
in
front
of
cadiz
was
a
fearful
hurricane
lasting
from
the
to
the
of
march
which
caused
grave
losses
to
the
vessels
in
the
outer
harbour
a
from
the

three
spanish
ships
one
of
which
the
was
a
of
guns
and
a
portuguese
upon
the
coast
about
puerto
santa
maria
and
rota
the
french
opened
upon
them
with
shot
and
destroyed
them
all
slaying
a
great
part
of
the
unfortunate
crews
who
had
no
thought
of
resistance
and
were
only
trying
to
escape
to
land
where
they
were
bound
to
become
prisoners
more
than
thirty
merchant
ships
mostly
british
were
destroyed
by
the
same
storm
one
was
a
transport
containing
a
wing
of
the
regiment
which
was
coming
to
reinforce
the
garrison
of
cadiz
some
men
from
this
unlucky
vessel
got
ashore
and
were
captured
by
the
french
a
month
after
the
loss
of
matagorda
the
outer
harbour
of
cadiz
again
saw
some
exciting
scenes
moored
beside
the
spanish
fleet
were
a
number
of
pontoons
old
from
which
the
masts
and
rigging
had
been
removed
and
which
were
used
as
on
them
there
were
still
kept
several
thousands
of
french
prisoners
mostly
the
men
captured
with
dupont
in
it
is
astonishing
that
the
regency
had
not
ordered
their
removal
to
some
more
remote
spot
the
moment
that
victor
s
army
appeared
in
front
of
cadiz
overcrowded
and
often
kept
without
sufficient
food
for
days
at
a
time
these
unhappy
captives
were
in
a
deplorable
position
the
sight
of
their
in
possession
of
the
opposite
coast
drove
them
to
desperation
and
they
were
prepared
to
take
any
risks
for
a
chance
of
escape
having
noted
during
the
hurricane
of
march
that
every
vessel
which
broke
loose
from
its
moorings
had
been
cast
by
the
set
of
the
tide
upon
the
coast
in
the
direction
of
rota
the
prisoners
on
the
on
which
nearly
all
the
officers
were
confined
waited
for
the
next
when
it
came
on
the
night
of
the
may
they
rose
upon
their
small
guard
of
spanish
marines
overpowered
them
and
then
cut
the
cables
of
the
pontoon
committing
themselves
to
the
perils
of
the
sea
as
well
as
to
the
risk
of
being
sunk
by
the
neighbouring
but
it
was
supposed
that
they
had
got
adrift
by
accident
and
they
had
been
carried
by
the
tide
almost
to
the
opposite
shore
before
it
was
realized
that
an
escape
was
on
foot
two
gunboats
sent
to
tow
the
back
met
with
resistance
the
prisoners
firing
on
them
with
the
muskets
taken
from
their
guard
and
throwing
cold
shot
down
upon
the
little
vessels
when
their
crews
tried
to
board
just
as
they
were
beaten
off
the
pontoon
went
ashore
the
french
garrisons
of
the
neighbouring
batteries
ran
down
to
help
their
countrymen
to
escape
at
the
same
moment
other
gunboats
spanish
and
english
came
up
and
began
firing
on
the
crowd
who
strove
to
swim
or
scramble
ashore
some
were
killed
but
over
got
to
land
it
is
surprising
that
after
this
incident
the
spaniards
did
not
take
better
care
of
the
remaining
pontoons
but
ten
days
later
the
prisoners
on
the
were
able
to
repeat
the
trick
of
their
comrades
on
this
occasion
the
absconding
vessel
ran
ashore
upon
a
some
hundreds
of
yards
from
the
shore
of
the
trocadero
the
stranded
vessel
remained
for
hours
under
the
fire
of
the
gunboats
which
pursued
it
and
a
large
proportion
of
the
men
on
board
perished
for
when
the
troops
on
shore
brought
out
boats
to
save
the
survivors
many
of
them
were
sunk
as
they
plied
between
the
and
the
land
finally
the
pontoon
was
set
on
fire
and
several
wounded
frenchmen
are
said
to
have
been
burnt
alive
the
english
seamen
who
were
engaged
in
this
distressing
business
were
heartily
disgusted
with
their
share
in
it
see

letter
of
charles
vaughan

the
beastly
necessity
of
firing
into
the
poor
devils

appendix
vol
ii
for
a
narrative
by
one
of
the
escaping
french
officers

of
colonel
chalbrand
after

the
regency
at
last
ordered
the
removal
of

few
remaining
officers
were
sent
to
majorca

presence

many
french
in

midst

riots

killed

of
the
prisoners

regency
ordered

them
to
be
placed
upon
the
desolate
rock
of
cabrera
where
there
were
no
inhabitants
and
no
shelter

ruined
castle

wretched
captives
without
roofs

tents
to
cover

supplied
with

at
uncertain
intervals

did
were
for
the
most
part
mere

invalids
for
life
even
allowing
for
the
desperate
straits
of
the
spanish
government
which
could
not
feed

the
treatment
of
the
cabrera
prisoners
was
indefensible
they
might
at

have
been
exchanged
for
some
of
the
numerous
spanish
garrisons
taken
in

would
not
permit
it

some
spanish
troops
as
well
as
british
and
portuguese
this
was
a
larger
garrison
than
was
needed
now
that
the
defences
had
been
put
in
order
and
it
was
possible
to
detach
small
expeditionary
corps
to
east
and
west
to
stir
up
trouble
in
the
of
andalusia
and
serve
as
the
nuclei
round
which
the
insurgents
of
the
mountains
might
gather
for
the
insurrection
in
the
remoter
corners
of
the
kingdom
of
granada
had
never
died
down
despite
of
all
the
efforts
of
sebastiani
to
quell
it
the
regency
had
now
determined
that
an
effort
should
be
made
to
extend
it
westward
the
sierra
de
ronda
being
quite
as
well
suited
for
irregular
operations
as
the
alpujarras
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
too
there
were
opportunities
in
the
condado
de
niebla
and
the
lands
by
the
mouth
of
the
guadiana
which
the
french
had
hardly
touched
trifling
detachments
of
the
corps
at
moguer
and
niebla
observed
rather
than
occupied
that
region
by
means
of
the
large
fleet
always
moored
in
cadiz
harbour
it
was
possible
to
transfer
troops
to
any
point
of
the
coast
for
the
french
could
not
guard
every
creek
and
and
if
an
expedition
failed
it
had
a
fair
chance
of
escaping
by
sea
moreover
any
force
thrown
ashore
in
the
south
had
the
option
of
retiring
into
gibraltar
if
hard
pressed
just
as
any
force
sent
to
the
west
might
retire
on
portugal
in
addition
to
the
insurgents
and
the
garrison
of
cadiz
there
were
two
regular
armies
whose
energies
might
be
turned
against
soult
the
relics
of
areizaga
s
unfortunate
host
which
had
fled
into
the
kingdom
of
murcia
and
had
been
rallied
by
blake
were
now
strong
and
since
suchet
s
expedition
against
valencia
had
failed
and
there
was
no
danger
from
the
north
this
force
could
be
employed
against
sebastiani
and
the
french
corps
in
the
kingdom
of
granada
it
was
in
a
deplorable
condition
but
was
yet
strong
enough
to
render
assistance
to
the
insurgents
of
the
alpujarras
by
demonstrating
against
granada
and
so
forcing
sebastiani
to
keep
his
troops
massed
for
a
regular
campaign
whenever
the
french
general
was
threatened
from
the
east
he
had
to
abandon
his
smaller
posts
and
to
desist
from
hunting
the
guerrilleros
who
thus
obtained
a
free
hand
the
regency
could
also
count
to
a
certain
extent
upon
aid
from
la
romana
and
the
army
of
estremadura
the
marquis
it
will
be
remembered
was
now
confronted
in
his
own
province
by
reynier
and
the
corps
but
he
had
thrust
his
flanking
division
under
ballasteros
into
the
mountains
of
andalusia
where
it
had
been
contending
with
mortier
s
corps
in
the
direction
of
araçena
and
zalamea
as
has
already
been
recounted
this
outlying
division
was
in
communication
with
cadiz
via
ayamonte
and
the
lower
guadiana
and
could
always
compel
soult
to
detach
troops
from
seville
by
descending
into
the
plains
la
romana
himself
could
and
occasionally
did
provide
further
occupation
for
the
corps
by
moving
other
troops
southward
on
the
seville
when
he
was
not
too
much
engrossed
by
reynier
s
demonstrations
in
his
front
see
pp
of
this
volume
and
see
pp
of
this
volume
thus
it
was
possible
to
harass
the
french
troops
in
andalusia
on
all
sides
with
the
object
of
securing
some
sort
of
unity
for
their
operations
the
regency
made
blake
of
the
forces
in
cadiz
as
well
as
of
those
in
murcia
declaring
them
parts
of
a
single
army
of
the
albuquerque
s
separate
charge
had
come
to
an
end
when
after
many
quarrels
with
the
cadiz
junta
he
resigned
the
post
of
governor
and
accepted
that
of
ambassador
to
the
court
of
james
s
at
the
end
of
march
he
died
not
long
after
his
arrival
in
london
engaged
to
the
last
in
a
hot
warfare
of
pamphlets
and
manifestos
with
the
junta
whose
monstrous
insinuations
against
his
probity
and
patriotism
are
said
to
have
driven
him
into
the
which
terminated
his
life
he
was
a
man
of
unsullied
honour
and
high
personal
courage
but
not
a
lucky
general
though
his
last
military
action
the
direction
of
the
army
of
estremadura
on
cadiz
was
a
sound
and
meritorious
piece
of
strategy
he
and
la
romana
were
the
only
spanish
officers
with
whom
wellington
was
able
to
work
in
concert
without
perpetual
friction
but
the
british
had
a
greater
respect
for
his
allies
hearts
than
for
their
heads
as
may
be
gathered
from
constant
references
in
the
as
well
as
from
the
confidential
conversations
of
the
duke
s
later
years
see
and
stanhope
s
with
the
duke
of
pp
and
blake
arrived
in
cadiz
on
april
having
turned
over
the
temporary
command
of
the
murcian
army
to
general
freire
the
cavalry
commander
who
had
served
under
venegas
and
areizaga
in
the
campaigns
of
almonacid
and
ocaña
he
set
himself
to
reorganize
the
various
estremaduran
and
other
troops
in
cadiz
into
one
division
of
horse
and
three
divisions
of
foot
which
he
numbered
vanguard
and
of
the
army
of
the
centre
the
murcian
forces
were
distributed
into
the
and
infantry
divisions
of
the
same
army
and
two
small
cavalry
divisions
this
reorganization
of
the
regular
troops
was
followed
by
systematic
attempts
to
foster
the
insurrection
to
right
and
left
of
seville
general
copons
was
sent
to
ayamonte
at
the
mouth
of
the
guadiana
with
men
round
whom
he
collected
a
miscellaneous
assemblage
of
peasantry
which
often
descended
from
the
hills
to
worry
the
french
garrisons
of
moguer
and
niebla
when
chased
by
stronger
forces
detached
from
mortier
s
corps
he
would
retire
into
portugal
when
unmolested
he
joined
hands
with
ballasteros
and
the
flanking
division
of
the
army
of
la
romana
or
executed
raids
of
his
own
in
the
central
plain
of
the
kingdom
of
seville
often
chased
and
sometimes
dispersed
his
bands
were
never
completely
crushed
and
kept
western
andalusia
or
spanish
algarve
as
it
was
called
in
the
old
days
when
the
boundaries
of
castile
and
portugal
had
only
just
been
fixed
in
a
state
of
constant
ferment
the
diversion
which
was
prepared
on
the
other
flank
by
blake
and
the
regency
was
far
more
important
their
intention
was
to
wrest
from
the
french
the
whole
district
of
the
sierra
de
ronda
the
mountain
region
between
gibraltar
and
malaga
and
so
to
thrust
in
a
wedge
between
victor
and
sebastiani
there
was
already
the
nucleus
of
an
insurrection
in
this
quarter
soon
after
king
joseph
s
triumphal
progress
from
xeres
by
ronda
and
malaga
to
granada
the
first
small
bands
had
appeared
they
were
headed
by
local
chiefs
such
as
becerra
ruiz
and
ortiz
better
known
as
el
pastor
whose
original
followers
were
a
party
of
the
smugglers
who
in
times
of
peace
and
war
alike
had
been
wont
to
ply
a
contraband
trade
with
gibraltar
in
march
and
april
they
were
not
strong
enough
to
do
more
than
molest
the
convoys
passing
from
malaga
and
seville
to
the
french
garrison
of
ronda
but
finding
the
enemy
in
their
neighbourhood
weak
and
helpless
the
bulk
of
the
corps
was
before
cadiz
and
that
of
the
corps
was
still
watching
la
romana
on
the
roads
north
of
seville
they
multiplied
in
numbers
and
extended
their
raids
far
afield
they
asked
for
aid
both
from
the
british
governor
of
gibraltar
and
from
the
regency
at
cadiz
promising
that
if
they
were
backed
by
regular
troops
they
would
easily
expel
the
french
and
master
the
whole
already
their
activity
had
produced
favourable
results
for
soult
sent
down
from
seville
girard
s
division
of
the
corps
a
detachment
which
left
mortier
too
weak
for
any
serious
operations
on
the
side
of
estremadura
and
sebastiani
drew
back
from
an
expedition
against
murcia
which
might
otherwise
have
proved
most
prejudicial
to
the
spanish
cause
this
raid
deserves
a
word
of
notice
just
after
blake
had
left
murcia
for
cadiz
sebastiani
who
had
for
the
moment
got
the
better
of
the
insurgents
in
the
alpujarras
assembled
at
baza
in
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
kingdom
of
granada
the
greater
part
of
the
corps
and
marched
with
men
on
lorca
freire
distrusting
his
troops
refused
to
fight
threw
men
into
the
impregnable
of
cartagena
and
retired
with
the
rest
of
his
army
to
alicante
within
the
borders
of
valencia
thus
the
rich
city
of
murcia
along
with
the
whole
of
the
rest
of
its
province
which
had
never
seen
the
french
before
was
exposed
undefended
to
sebastiani
he
entered
it
on
april
and
commenced
by
fining
the
corporation
dollars
for
not
having
received
him
with
a
royal
salute
and
the
ringing
of
the
bells
of
their
churches
the
rest
of
his
behaviour
was
in
keeping
he
entered
the
cathedral
while
mass
was
in
progress
and
interrupted
the
service
to
seize
the
plate
and
jewels
he
confiscated
the
money
and
other
valuables
in
all
the
monasteries
hospitals
and
banks
he
permitted
his
officers
to
blackmail
many
rich
inhabitants
and
his
rank
and
file
to
plunder
houses
and
shops
two
days
after
his
entry
he
retraced
his
footsteps
and
retreated
hastily
towards
granada
leaving
a
ruined
city
behind
him
the
cause
of
his
sudden
departure
was
the
news
that
the
insurgents
of
the
alpujarras
whom
he
had
vainly
imagined
that
he
had
crushed
were
beleaguering
all
his
small
garrisons
and
that
malaga
itself
had
been
seized
by
a
large
band
of
the
serranos
and
held
for
a
short
space
though
general
perreymond
had
afterwards
succeeded
in
driving
them
out
but
the
whole
of
the
alhama
and
ronda
sierras
were
up
in
arms
no
less
than
the
more
eastern
hills
where
the
rising
had
begun
it
would
have
been
absurd
for
sebastiani
to
proceed
any
further
with
the
offensive
campaign
in
murcia
when
southern
andalusia
was
being
lost
behind
his
back
for
strange
and
scandalous
details
of
sebastiani
s
doings
in
murcia
see
schepeler
iii
pp
throughout
the
month
of
may
girard
and
sebastiani
with
some
small
assistance
from
dessolles
who
spared
a
few
battalions
from
the
kingdom
of
cordova
were
actively
engaged
in
endeavouring
to
repress
the
mountaineers
the
larger
bands
were
dispersed
not
without
severe
fighting
girard
s
men
had
hot
work
at
albondonates
on
may
and
at
grazalema
on
may
but
just
as
the
main
roads
had
been
reopened
and
the
blockade
of
the
french
garrison
of
ronda
raised
the
whole
situation
was
changed
by
the
landing
at
algeciras
of
general
lacy
with
a
division
of
regulars
sent
from
cadiz
by
the
regency
june
his
arrival
raised
the
spirits
of
the
insurgents
and
they
thronged
in
thousands
to
his
aid
when
he
announced
his
intention
of
marching
against
ronda
lacy
however
was
both
irresolute
and
as
he
afterwards
showed
on
a
larger
stage
when
he
became
of
catalonia
on
arriving
before
ronda
he
judged
the
rocky
stronghold
too
formidable
for
him
to
meddle
with
and
turned
aside
to
grazalema
to
the
disgust
of
his
followers
he
then
fell
into
a
quarrel
with
the
serranos
dismissed
many
of
them
smugglers
and
others
from
his
camp
as
unworthy
to
serve
alongside
of
regular
soldiers
and
even
imprisoned
some
of
the
more
turbulent
chiefs
at
this
moment
girard
from
the
north
and
sebastiani
from
the
east
began
to
close
in
upon
him
uneasy
at
their
approach
lacy
fell
back
towards
the
coast
and
after
some
insignificant
skirmishes
his
force
at
estepona
and
marbella
from
whence
he
sailed
round
to
gibraltar
and
landed
at
the
lines
of
san
roque
under
the
walls
of
that
fortress
july
almost
the
only
positive
gain
produced
by
his
expedition
had
been
the
occupation
of
marbella
where
he
left
a
garrison
which
maintained
itself
for
a
considerable
time
it
was
no
doubt
something
to
have
detained
girard
and
sebastiani
in
the
remote
mountain
of
the
south
for
a
full
month
when
they
were
much
needed
by
soult
in
other
directions
yet
the
evil
results
of
lacy
s
timid
manœuvres
and
hasty
flight
upon
the
morale
of
the
insurgents
might
have
been
sufficiently
great
to
counterbalance
these
small
advantages
if
the
serranos
had
been
less
tough
and
resolute
it
is
surprising
to
find
that
they
did
not
lose
courage
but
kept
the
rising
afoot
with
undiminished
energy
being
apparently
confirmed
in
their
by
the
poor
show
made
by
the
regular
army
rather
than
disheartened
at
the
ineffective
succour
sent
them
from
cadiz
despite
of
all
the
efforts
of
soult
s
flying
columns
they
could
not
be
entirely
dispersed
though
they
were
hunted
a
hundred
times
from
valley
to
valley
the
power
of
the
viceroy
of
andalusia
stopped
short
at
the
though
his
dragoons
kept
the
plains
in
subjection
every
time
that
ronda
and
the
other
isolated
garrisons
in
the
mountains
had
to
be
revictualled
the
convoy
had
to
fight
its
way
to
its
destination
through
swarms
of
sniping
insurgents
martinien
s
lists
show
that
the
regiment
of
girard
s
division
lost
four
officers
at
albondonates
and
the
the
same
number
at
grazalema
so
the
skirmishes
must
have
been
fairly
vigorous
that
lacy
s
force
was
not
so
entirely
destroyed
as
napier
implies
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
many
of
the
same
regiments
could
be
utilized
for
the
subsequent
expedition
to
the
condado
de
niebla
for
illustrative
anecdotes
of
warfare
in
the
serrania
de
ronda
see
the
autobiography
of
rocca
of
the
hussars
who
was
busy
in
this
region
in
the
spring
and
summer
of
the
regency
had
not
yet
done
with
lacy
and
his
expeditionary
force
after
they
had
lain
for
some
time
under
the
walls
of
gibraltar
they
were
and
taken
back
to
cadiz
from
where
a
short
time
after
they
were
dispatched
for
a
raid
in
the
condado
de
niebla
in
this
region
where
copons
was
already
in
arms
the
french
forces
under
remond
and
the
duke
of
aremberg
were
so
weak
that
the
junta
believed
that
lacy
s
division
would
easily
clear
the
whole
of
the
enemy
its
liberation
would
be
most
valuable
because
cadiz
was
wont
to
draw
both
corn
and
cattle
from
the
lands
between
the
rio
tinto
and
guadiana
and
had
felt
bitterly
the
want
of
its
accustomed
supplies
since
the
war
had
been
carried
thither
lacy
landed
in
the
bay
of
huelva
on
august
with
nearly
men
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
and
to
overcome
in
succession
two
small
french
columns
which
marched
against
him
from
moguer
and
from
san
juan
del
puerto
thereupon
the
duke
of
aremberg
whose
whole
force
in
this
region
was
less
than
men
two
battalions
of
the
of
the
line
and
the
chasseurs
evacuated
niebla
and
fell
back
on
seville
copons
who
had
been
told
to
join
lacy
but
had
failed
to
receive
his
instructions
in
time
pursued
a
separate
french
column
under
general
remond
for
some
distance
but
was
soon
stopped
by
the
news
that
a
large
force
was
moving
against
him
to
repair
this
check
to
the
french
arms
lacy
meanwhile
to
the
surprise
and
disgust
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
condado
on
august
and
went
back
to
cadiz
professing
to
regard
the
purpose
of
his
expedition
as
completed
he
had
this
much
justification
that
the
news
of
his
raid
had
induced
soult
to
send
out
against
him
at
a
most
critical
moment
the
main
body
of
gazan
s
division
which
marched
to
niebla
vainly
sought
the
expeditionary
force
and
returned
to
its
base
after
wasting
a
fortnight
but
a
larger
garrison
was
now
left
in
western
andalusia
copons
was
hunted
more
vigorously
than
before
and
cruel
reprisals
were
made
on
the
inhabitants
of
moguer
and
huelva
who
had
aided
lacy
feeble
as
it
had
been
lacy
s
raid
on
the
condado
had
staved
off
a
serious
danger
to
the
spanish
army
of
estremadura
by
forcing
soult
to
detach
gazan
against
him
at
a
moment
when
he
was
concentrating
the
corps
for
a
blow
at
la
romana
and
was
already
engaged
in
active
operations
against
the
marquis
a
complete
change
had
taken
place
in
the
situation
in
estremadura
at
the
end
of
july
when
reynier
acting
under
orders
from
masséna
had
marched
northward
from
his
old
base
at
merida
and
medellin
and
crossed
the
tagus
at
the
ferry
of
alconetar
above
the
broken
bridge
of
alcantara
july
this
removal
of
the
whole
corps
to
the
north
followed
as
we
have
already
seen
by
the
corresponding
transference
of
hill
s
british
force
from
portalegre
to
the
neighbourhood
of
castello
branco
had
left
la
romana
at
badajoz
with
no
enemy
in
front
of
him
and
had
caused
a
complete
rupture
of
communications
between
the
french
army
of
andalusia
and
the
army
of
portugal
who
could
for
the
future
only
hear
of
each
other
by
the
circuitous
route
through
madrid
since
that
by
almaraz
was
closed
see
pp
of
this
volume
not
marked
in
any
contemporary
map
that
i
have
seen
it
is
situated
however
opposite
the
junction
of
the
river
almonte
with
the
tagus
about
eighteen
miles
above
alcantara
near
the
ancient
ruined
bridge
of
mantible
soult
had
now
thrown
upon
his
hands
to
his
immense
disgust
the
task
of
containing
the
whole
of
la
romana
s
force
which
reynier
had
been
keeping
in
check
from
march
till
july
accordingly
he
called
back
from
the
sierra
de
ronda
the
division
of
girard
wishing
to
reunite
the
whole
corps
for
the
protection
of
the
northern
approaches
to
seville
he
was
only
just
in
time
for
la
romana
had
seen
his
opportunity
and
had
resolved
to
concentrate
his
army
for
a
demonstration
against
andalusia
which
seemed
to
offer
great
temptations
while
nothing
but
the
solitary
division
of
gazan
stood
between
him
and
seville
and
that
division
moreover
was
weakened
by
the
detachments
under
remond
and
aremberg
which
lay
in
the
condado
de
niebla
accordingly
the
marquis
leaving
charles
o
donnell
to
watch
reynier
on
the
tagus
and
another
division
to
guard
badajoz
marched
with
his
cavalry
and
the
infantry
of
la
carrera
and
ballasteros
to
invade
andalusia
he
also
told
copons
to
come
up
to
reinforce
him
with
his
levies
from
the
lower
guadiana
even
without
the
help
of
the
latter
who
never
succeeded
in
reaching
him
he
had
foot
and
horse
but
la
romana
was
always
unlucky
when
he
fought
just
as
he
started
girard
had
returned
from
ronda
to
seville
on
hearing
that
the
army
of
estremadura
was
on
the
move
soult
pushed
the
newly
returned
division
strengthened
by
part
of
gazan
s
regiments
and
a
brigade
of
cavalry
out
towards
the
passes
of
the
morena
on
august
girard
with
about
bayonets
and
sabres
encountered
la
romana
at
villagarcia
just
outside
the
town
of
llerena
the
spaniards
were
eager
to
fight
believing
that
they
had
only
to
deal
with
some
fraction
of
gazan
s
division
the
news
of
girard
s
return
from
ronda
had
not
yet
reached
them
they
got
involved
in
a
severe
combat
were
beaten
and
were
forced
back
to
zafra
and
almendralejo
with
a
loss
of
men
triple
that
of
the
french
which
had
just
rejoined
him
from
the
north
after
the
fall
of
ciudad
rodrigo
see
soult
then
strengthened
girard
s
column
placed
mortier
in
command
and
bade
him
push
for
badajoz
but
just
as
the
duke
of
treviso
was
preparing
to
advance
the
news
of
lacy
s
disembarkation
at
moguer
arrived
there
were
hardly
any
troops
left
in
seville
wherefore
soult
hastily
recalled
from
mortier
such
of
gazan
s
regiments
as
were
with
him
and
nearly
all
the
cavalry
and
sent
them
off
against
lacy
girard
s
division
retired
from
zafra
and
took
up
a
defensive
position
in
the
passes
covering
seville
thus
a
dangerous
crisis
was
avoided
for
if
the
whole
corps
had
marched
on
badajoz
in
august
and
had
driven
back
la
romana
into
portugal
wellington
s
flank
in
the
alemtejo
would
have
been
left
exposed
there
was
no
longer
a
british
division
south
of
the
tagus
to
support
the
spanish
army
of
estremadura
since
hill
had
transferred
himself
to
castello
branco
in
order
to
contain
reynier
of
regular
troops
indeed
wellington
had
nothing
left
on
the
alemtejo
frontier
save
madden
s
brigade
of
portuguese
horse
and
the
two
infantry
regiments
of
the
same
nation
who
formed
part
of
the
garrison
of
elvas
hence
he
was
much
troubled
at
la
romana
s
tendency
to
take
the
offensive
against
seville
and
repeatedly
begged
him
to
content
himself
with
defensive
operations
and
not
to
attract
the
notice
of
soult
for
the
duke
of
dalmatia
if
left
alone
had
enough
to
occupy
his
attention
in
andalusia
yet
if
provoked
might
abandon
some
outlying
part
of
his
viceroyalty
in
order
to
concentrate
a
force
which
might
crush
the
estremaduran
army
and
then
execute
that
diversion
against
portugal
south
of
the
tagus
which
wellington
so
much
dreaded
see
wellington
vi
i
am
a
little
anxious
about
mortier
s
movement
into
estremadura
not
on
account
of
the
progress
he
can
make
but
because
i
think
that
the
marquis
de
la
romana
is
inclined
to
fight
a
battle
if
we
could
only
avoid
a
disaster
for
some
time
i
hope
we
may
do
some
good
at
cf
also
vi
pp
and
yet
despite
the
warning
that
he
had
received
at
the
combat
of
villagarcia
and
despite
of
his
ally
s
entreaties
la
romana
renewed
in
september
the
project
that
had
cost
him
so
dear
in
august
learning
that
the
passes
in
front
of
seville
were
once
more
weakly
held
by
the
french
he
began
to
move
his
army
southward
in
detachments
till
he
had
gathered
a
heavy
force
at
guadalcanal
and
monasterio
attributing
his
misfortunes
in
the
last
month
to
the
weakness
of
his
cavalry
he
brought
down
with
him
madden
s
portuguese
horsemen
a
weak
brigade
of
men
which
wellington
had
put
at
his
disposition
not
foreseeing
that
its
existence
would
add
to
the
inclination
which
the
marquis
felt
for
offensive
demonstrations
the
inevitable
result
followed
disquieted
by
the
activity
of
the
estremaduran
army
its
raiding
parties
had
already
pressed
as
far
as
santa
olalla
on
the
seville
road
and
constantina
on
the
cordova
road
soult
ordered
mortier
to
concentrate
the
main
body
of
the
corps
at
ronquillo
and
to
attack
the
enemy
la
romana
gave
back
at
once
evacuating
the
passes
but
his
rearguard
was
overtaken
at
fuente
cantos
behind
monasterio
by
the
french
horse
his
cavalry
under
la
carrera
turned
to
bay
to
cover
the
retreat
but
was
charged
and
scattered
with
heavy
loss
by
briche
s
chasseurs
who
captured
the
battery
that
accompanied
it
and
enveloped
a
large
mass
of
the
beaten
horsemen
who
would
have
been
forced
to
surrender
if
madden
s
portuguese
charging
at
the
right
moment
and
with
great
vigour
had
not
checked
the
french
advance
and
given
time
for
the
routed
brigades
to
save
themselves
in
the
hills

though
pursued
by
the
french
reserves
made
a
steady
and
successful
retreat
with
small
loss
the
spaniards
however
left
behind
them
six
guns
and
killed
and
wounded
while
the
french
loss
had
not
exceeded
the
brigade
consisted
of
three
squadrons
each
of
the
and
regiments
and
two
of
the
beresford

report
to
wellington
speaks
of
their
behaviour
in
the
highest
terms
see
soriano

pp
dissatisfied
with
all
his
cavalry
officers
la
romana
had
removed
la
carrera
to
the
command
of
the
horse
making
over
his
old
infantry
division
to
carlos
d
españa
mortier
then
pursued
la
romana
to
zafra
and
pushed
his
advanced
cavalry
as
far
as
fuente
del
maestre
only
thirty
miles
from
badajoz
thus
the
situation
which
wellington
most
dreaded
had
come
into
existence
once
again
a
considerable
french
army
was
moving
into
central
estremadura
and
threatening
the
alemtejo
frontier
south
of
the
tagus
at
a
moment
when
every
man
of
the
field
army
was
fully
employed
in
beira
by
the
advance
of
masséna
but
again
as
in
august
mortier
did
not
push
his
advantage
though
la
romana
actually
retired
behind
the
tagus
to
montijo
after
raising
the
garrison
of
badajoz
to
its
full
strength
and
left
the
duke
of
treviso
the
opportunity
of
laying
siege
either
to
that
city
to
olivenza
or
even
to
elvas
if
he
should
so
please
but
the
governing
fact
in
all
the
operations
of
soult
and
his
lieutenants
at
this
period
was
as
we
have
already
pointed
out
that
if
any
great
concentration
of
the
french
for
offensive
purposes
took
place
it
was
only
made
by
withdrawing
the
garrison
troops
from
some
one
of
the
many
disturbed
regions
of
andalusia
when
the
whole
corps
was
united
and
had
advanced
to
zafra
western
andalusia
was
almost
stripped
of
troops
indeed
at
seville
itself
soult
had
nothing
but
his
new
spanish
levies
and
the
convalescents
from
his
central
hospital
together
with
some
detachments
escorting
convoys
which
happened
to
be
passing
through
the
city
and
had
been
detained
in
order
to
add
a
few
hundred
bayonets
to
its
garrison
when
therefore
copons
began
to
make
himself
felt
once
more
in
the
condado
de
niebla
and
a
second
raiding
expedition
from
cadiz
landed
at
huelva
soult
felt
very
uncomfortable
his
perturbation
of
mind
was
increased
by
news
from
the
east
sebastiani
at
this
moment
had
been
molested
by
demonstrations
of
the
spanish
army
of
murcia
against
his
flank
blake
had
returned
in
august
from
cadiz
to
inspect
the
section
of
his
forces
which
he
had
left
behind
under
freire
and
which
he
had
not
seen
since
april
he
had
pushed
reconnaissances
to
huescar
in
the
kingdom
of
granada
had
sent
supplies
to
aid
the
insurgents
of
the
alpujarras
and
was
beginning
to
stir
up
a
new
rising
on
the
side
of
jaen
this
provoked
sebastiani
to
concentrate
the
larger
part
of
the
corps
and
to
march
against
him
with
men
blake
gave
back
before
his
enemy
as
far
as
the
neighbourhood
of
murcia
where
he
had
prepared
a
fortified
position
by
inundating
the
huerta
or
suburban
plain
which
is
watered
by
many
canals
drawn
from
the
river
segura
and
by
stockading
all
the
villages
fourteen
thousand
regulars
with
a
powerful
artillery
held
the
approaches
while
a
mass
of
armed
peasantry
hung
around
sebastiani
s
flanks
the
french
however
only
advanced
as
far
as
lebrilla
twelve
miles
from
murcia
and
then
halted
sebastiani
after
reconnoitring
blake
s
line
thought
it
too
powerful
to
be
meddled
with
and
retired
two
days
later
towards
his
base
much
harassed
by
the
peasantry
on
his
way
but
during
the
three
weeks
that
it
took
for
the
french
general
to
concentrate
his
to
march
on
murcia
and
to
return
all
had
gone
to
wrack
and
ruin
behind
him
the
insurgents
of
the
alpujarras
had
captured
the
important
seaport
towns
of
almunecar
and
motril
and
had
garrisoned
their
castles
with
the
aid
of
english
guns
sent
from
gibraltar
the
people
of
the
sierra
de
alhama
had
cut
the
roads
between
malaga
and
granada
and
mountaineers
had
attacked
granada
itself
they
were
defeated
outside
its
gates
by
the
garrison
on
but
were
still
hanging
about
its
vicinity
the
corps
was
now
a
little
stronger
than
it
had
been
in
the
spring
the
regiment
strong
having
joined
from
madrid
but
it
was
still
short
of
its
german
division
which
now
lay
in
la
mancha
but
had
never
crossed
the
sierra
morena
the
news
of
all
these
troubles
had
reached
soult
while
sebastiani
was
quite
out
of
touch
lost
to
sight
in
the
kingdom
of
murcia
they
undoubtedly
had
their
part
in
inducing
the
marshal
to
recall
mortier
and
the
corps
from
estremadura
he
once
more
divided
its
two
divisions
drawing
back
gazan
to
seville
to
form
his
central
reserve
while
girard
watched
the
passes
as
before
meanwhile
copons
had
already
been
beaten
in
the
condado
by
the
column
of
general
remond
and
sebastiani
on
his
return
cleared
the
neighbourhood
of
granada
and
malaga
of
insurgents
and
drove
the
untameable
bands
of
the
alpujarras
to
take
refuge
in
their
mountains
motril
and
almunecar
were
both
recovered
thus
the
storm
passed
as
soon
as
the
two
french
expeditionary
forces
under
mortier
and
sebastiani
returned
once
more
to
their
usual
only
two
more
incidents
remain
to
be
chronicled
in
the
andalusian
campaign
of
campbell
the
governor
of
gibraltar
had
resolved
somewhat
too
late
to
lend
a
small
detachment
to
aid
the
granadan
insurgents
the
plan
which
he
concerted
with
the
spanish
governor
of
ceuta
was
that
lord
blayney
with
two
british
battalions
from
the
gibraltar
garrison
the
and
lord
blayney
s
force
had
only
a
not
a
whole
battalion
of
the
but
contained
companies
of
foreign
chasseurs
and
a
spanish
regiment
imperial
de
toledo
from
ceuta
men
in
all
should
be
thrown
on
shore
at
fuengirola
twenty
miles
on
the
nearer
side
of
malaga
where
there
was
a
small
french
garrison
and
a
dépôt
of
stores
which
was
serving
for
a
brigade
then
engaged
in
the
siege
of
marbella
the
town
which
had
been
garrisoned
by
lacy
in
june
and
which
was
still
holding
out
gallantly
in
october
see
of
this
chapter
it
was
calculated
that
on
hearing
of
a
descent
at
fuengirola
sebastiani
would
come
with
the
larger
part
of
the
garrison
of
malaga
to
relieve
the
fort
but
the
moment
that
he
was
known
to
be
nearing
the
expeditionary
force
lord
blayney
was
to
and
to
make
a
dash
at
malaga
itself
which
he
could
reach
more
swiftly
by
water
than
sebastiani
by
land
secret
partisans
within
the
city
were
ready
to
take
arms
and
the
peasantry
of
the
sierra
de
alhama
were
also
enlisted
in
the
enterprise
the
scheme
seems
liable
to
many
criticisms
the
whole
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
winds
and
waves
of
stormy
october
what
would
happen
if
the
weather
was
too
rough
to
allow
of
or
of
easy
landing
at
malaga
and
if
malaga
were
captured
for
the
moment
for
how
long
could
regulars
backed
by
a
mass
of
undisciplined
insurgents
hold
it
against
the
whole
of
sebastiani
s
corps
which
would
be
hurled
upon
it
at
short
notice
the
expedition
however
was
not
actually
wrecked
on
either
of
these
dangers
but
ruined
by
the
folly
of
its
chief
lord
blayney
landed
successfully
on
october
and
laid
siege
to
fuengirola
which
was
held
by
poles
under
a
captain
milokosiewitz
instead
of
making
the
attack
a
mere
demonstration
he
brought
some
ashore
and
set
to
work
to
batter
the
castle
in
all
seriousness
finding
its
walls
commencing
to
crumble
he
held
on
for
two
days
though
if
he
had
reflected
he
must
have
remembered
that
the
garrison
of
malaga
might
be
with
him
at
any
moment
he
was
busily
preparing
for
an
assault
when
sebastiani
suddenly
fell
upon
him
with
men
from
the
rear
apparently
the
english
commander
had
neglected
to
keep
up
any
watch
on
the
side
of
the
inland
and
the
peasantry
had
failed
to
send
any
intelligence
of
the
fact
that
the
french
were
on
the
move
the
besiegers
taken
entirely
by
surprise
and
distracted
also
by
a
sortie
of
the
little
garrison
were
rolled
down
to
the
in
confusion
lord
blayney
a
man
rode
in
among
some
french
whom
he
mistook
for
spaniards
and
was
made
prisoner
in
the
most
ignominious
fashion
the
spanish
regiment
got
off
with
little
loss
it
had
kept
its
ranks
and
forced
its
way
to
the
boats
after
beating
off
an
attack
the
was
partly
on
shipboard
at
the
moment
of
the
combat
and
the
companies
which
were
on
shore
saved
themselves
by
a
steady
rearguard
action
but
the
battalion
of
the
was
half
destroyed
losing
over
prisoners
besides
some
forty
killed
the
utter
incapacity
of
the
british
commander
was
best
shown
by
the
fact
that
if
he
had
but
carried
out
the
plan
on
which
he
was
acting
he
would
certainly
have
captured
malaga
for
sebastiani
had
left
only
men
in
the
city
when
he
marched
on
fuengirola
and
if
the
expeditionary
force
had
hours
before
the
disaster
it
would
have
found
the
place
practically
undefended
and
sebastiani
a
long
day
s
march
away
and
incapable
of
returning
in
time
to
save
it
lord
blayney
a
humorous
person
save
when
the
absurdities
of
his
own
generalship
were
in
question
wrote
an
interesting
narrative
of
his
forced
journey
to
france
which
contains
one
of
the
best
accounts
of
the
state
of
madrid
under
king
joseph
s
government
as
well
as
some
curious
notes
on
the
state
of
the
english
prisoners
at
verdun
in
the
very
last
military
event
of
the
year
on
the
andalusian
side
was
a
disaster
far
worse
than
that
of
lord
blayney
suffered
by
a
general
whose
almost
unbroken
series
of
defeats
from
medina
de
rio
seco
down
to
belchite
ought
to
have
taught
him
by
this
time
the
advantages
of
caution
and
the
doubtful
policy
of
risking
a
demoralized
army
in
a
fight
upon
open
ground
when
sebastiani
retired
from
the
kingdom
of
murcia
in
the
first
days
of
september
blake
had
brought
back
his
army
to
its
old
positions
on
the
frontier
of
that
realm
seven
weeks
later
finding
the
french
line
in
front
of
him
very
weak
he
resolved
to
try
a
demonstration
in
force
or
perhaps
even
a
serious
stroke
against
the
force
of
the
enemy
in
granada
on
november
he
crossed
the
murcian
border
with
foot
and
horse
and
occupied
cullar
on
the
next
day
he
was
at
the
gates
of
baza
where
there
were
four
battalions
of
the
french
force
which
covered
granada
but
on
the
next
morning
general
milhaud
rode
up
with
a
powerful
body
of
horsemen
the
greater
part
of
his
own
division
of
dragoons
and
the
polish
lancers
from
sebastiani
s
some
men
in
all
though
he
had
only
infantry
to
back
him
milhaud
determined
to
fight
at
once
blake
s
army
invited
an
attack
it
was
advancing
down
the
with
the
cavalry
deployed
in
front
one
division
of
infantry
supporting
it
while
a
second
division
was
some
miles
to
the
rear
on
the
hills
which
separate
the
plain
of
baza
from
the
upland
of
the
sierra
de
oria
a
rearguard
of
men
was
still
at
cullar
ten
miles
from
the
scene
of
action
the
situation
much
resembled
that
of
suchet
s
combat
of
margalef
and
led
to
the
same
results
for
milhaud
s
squadrons
charging
fiercely
along
and
on
each
side
of
the
road
completely
routed
blake
s
cavalry
and
drove
it
back
on
to
the
leading
infantry
division
which
broke
and
was
badly
cut
up
before
its
remnants
could
take
shelter
with
the
other
division
in
reserve
on
the
hill
behind
blake
gave
the
order
for
an
instant
retreat
and
milhaud
could
not
follow
far
among
the
rocks
and
defiles
but
he
had
captured
a
battery
of
artillery
and
a
thousand
prisoners
and
killed
or
wounded
some
men
more
in
the
few
minutes
during
which
the
engagement
lasted
the
french
cavalry
lost
no
more
than
men
the
infantry
had
hardly
fired
a
shot
blake
not
being
pursued
retired
only
as
far
as
the
venta
de
bahul
on
the
other
side
of
cullar
and
remained
on
the
murcian
border
cured
for
a
time
of
his
mania
for
taking
the
offensive
at
the
head
of
a
demoralized
army
from
the
and
line
rey
s

of

the
in

and
arteche
is
a
misprint
that
regiment
was
with
girard
in
the
sierra
morena
miles
away
thus
ended
the
inconclusive
campaign
of
in
andalusia
the
french
on
the
last
day
of
the
year
held
almost
precisely
the
same
limits
of
territory
that
they
had
occupied
on
the
of
march
they
had
beaten
the
enemy
in
four
or
five
considerable
actions
yet
had
gained
nothing
thereby
they
were
beginning
to
understand
that
cadiz
was
impregnable
and
that
the
complete
subjection
of
the
mountains
of
the
south
and
east
was
a
far
more
serious
task
than
had
been
at
first
supposed
things
indeed
had
come
to
a
deadlock
and
soult
kept
reporting
to
his
master
that
another
men
would
be
required
to
enable
him
to
complete
his
task
almost
as
many
battalions
belonging
to
the
and
corps
as
would
have
made
up
that
force
had
been
sent
by
the
emperor
into
spain
they
were
intended
to
join
their
regiments
in
the
end
but
meanwhile
they
had
been
distracted
into
the
and
corps
and
were
marching
in
the
direction
of
portugal
when
soult
wished
to
see
them
on
the
guadalquivir
very
little
of
the
mass
of
reinforcements
which
had
been
poured
into
the
peninsula
in
the
spring
of
had
come
his
way
while
the
whole
battalions
had
been
sent
away
with
junot
or
drouet
the
drafts
in
smaller
units
had
been
largely
intercepted
by
the
generals
along
the
line
of
communication
there
were
of
such
recruits
detained
in
new
castile
alone
and
formed
into
provisional
battalions
to
garrison
madrid
and
its
neighbourhood
king
joseph
must
not
be
blamed
too
much
for
thus
stopping
them
on
their
way
he
had
been
left
with
an
utterly
inadequate
force
when
the
emperor
turned
off
everything
on
to
the
direction
of
portugal
during
the
summer
and
autumn
of
there
were
with
him
only
two
french
infantry
regiments
the
same
number
of
light
cavalry
regiments
lahoussaye
s
weak
division
of
dragoons
and
the
german
division
of
the
corps
less
than
strong
over
and
above
his
own
guard
and
untrustworthy
juramentado
battalions
the
royal
troops
numbered
about
men
the
other
units
including
soult
s
detained
drafts
about
with
them
joseph
had
to
garrison
madrid
avila
segovia
toledo
and
almaraz
and
hold
down
all
new
castile
and
la
mancha
which
last
province
was
described
at
the
time
as
populated
solely
by
beggars
and
brigands
he
had
the
duty
of
maintaining
the
sole
and
very
circuitous
line
of
communication
between
soult
and
masséna
which
after
reynier
went
north
in
july
had
to
be
worked
via
almaraz
he
was
frequently
annoyed
not
only
by
the
empecinado
and
other
guerrilleros
but
by
villacampa
who
descended
from
higher
aragon
into
the
cuenca
region
and
by
blake
s
cavalry
which
often
raided
la
mancha
but
his
great
fear
was
lest
la
romana
or
wellington
should
send
troops
up
the
vast
gap
left
between
reynier
at
zarza
and
coria
and
mortier
in
the
sierra
morena
there
was
nothing
but
lahoussaye
s
dragoons
and
two
infantry
battalions
in
the
whole
district
about
almaraz
and
talavera
where
such
a
blow
would
have
fallen
it
was
small
wonder
that
he
felt
uncomfortable
the
corps
had
in
its
ranks
the
battalions
of
the
following
regiments
whose
first
three
battalions
were
in
the
south
of
spain
and
belonged
to
the
or
corps
the
and
but
the
corps
was
almost
entirely
composed
of
battalions
of
the
corps
of
victor
sebastiani
and
mortier
including
those
of
the
line
and
and
léger
of
the
corps
and
of
the
léger
and
and
line
of
the
corps
and
the
remaining
brigade
of
the
division
of
the
corps
which
never
joined
sebastiani
in
andalusia
chasseurs
and
dutch
hussars
and

only
two
squadrons
each
only
men
as
a
sample
of
their
behaviour
it
may
be
mentioned
that
the
whole
guard
of
the
south
gate
of
toledo
once
marched
off
to
join
the
insurgents
officers
and
all
but
military
sources
of
disquietude
formed
only
the
smaller
half
of
king
joseph
s
troubles
at
this
date
his
political
vexations
which
engrossed
a
much
larger
portion
of
his
time
and
energy
must
be
dealt
with
elsewhere
they
will
be
relegated
to
the
same
chapter
which
treats
of
the
new
development
of
spanish
politics
consequent
on
the
meeting
of

masséna
s

to
bussaco
september
after
the
fall
of
almeida
masséna
waited
much
longer
than
wellington
had
anticipated
the
reasons
for
his
delay
were
the
usual
ones
that
were
always
forthcoming
when
a
french
army
had
to
advance
in
the
peninsula
want
of
transport
and
penury
of
supplies
the
marshal
had
just
discovered
that
the
in
front
of
him
had
already
been
depopulated
by
wellington
s
orders
and
that
the
only
inhabitants
that
were
to
be
met
would
be
the
armed
ordenança
who
were
already
shooting
at
his
vedettes
and
attacking
his
foraging
parties
he
was
inclined
to
treat
them
as
brigands
his
colonel
pavetti
having
been
surprised
and
captured
along
with
five
gendarmes
of
his
escort
by
the
villagers
of
nava
d
avel
on
september
he
caused
the
place
to
be
burned
shot
the
one
or
two
male
inhabitants
who
could
be
caught
and
issued
a
proclamation
stating
that
no
quarter
would
be
given
to
combatants
without
uniforms
this
provoked
two
stiff
letters
from
wellington
who
wrote
to
say
that
the
ordenança
were
an
integral
part
of
the
portuguese
military
forces
and
that
if
they
wore
no
uniforms
the
marshal
should
remember
that
many
of
the
revolutionary
bands
which
he
had
commanded
in
the
old
war
of
were
no
better
equipped

were
shot
as
brigands
and
highway
robbers
in
obedience
to
the
proclamation
of
september
it
was
certain
that
french
stragglers
and
foragers
would
be
knocked
on
the
head
and
not
taken
prisoners
by
the
enraged
peasantry
at
present
the
number
of
them
sent
in
to
the
british
head
quarters
by
the
portuguese
irregulars
proved
that
the
laws
of
war
were
being
observed
masséna
replied
that
pavetti
had
been
ambushed
by
men
who
hid
their
arms
and
ran
in
upon
him
and
his
escort
while
he
was
peaceably
asking
his
way
his
letter
then
went
off
at
a
tangent
to
discuss
high
politics
and
to
declare
that
he
was
not
the
enemy
of
the
portuguese
but
of
the
perfidious
british
government
finally
he
complained
that
the
arganil
and
trancoso
militia
whom
he
had
sent
home
after
the
fall
of
almeida
had
taken
up
arms
again
if
caught
leur

the
last
statement
wellington
denied
he
said
that
the
capitulation
had
been
annulled
by
the
french
themselves
when
they
debauched
the
regiment
and
detained
of
the
militia
to
form
a
battalion
of
pioneers
but
stated
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
militia
battalions
had
not
been
the
french
continued
to
shoot
the
ordenança
and
the
ordenança
soon
began
to
reply
by
torturing
as
well
as
hanging
french
stragglers
wellington
forbade
but
could
not
prevent
retaliation
wellington
to
masséna
and
masséna
to
wellington
from
fort
concepcion
du
ministère
de
la
in
his
dispatch
to
berthier
of
september
masséna
explains
that
the
depopulation
of
the
district
in
front
of
him
and
the
fact
that
the
ordenança
had
taken
arms
throughout
the
have
compelled
him
to
make
an
enormous
provision
of
food
for
his
army
since
the
land
has
been
swept
bare
he
must
collect
fifteen
or
twenty
days
rations
for
the
and
corps
each
day
demonstrates
the
necessity
of
this
more
clearly
but
each
day
makes
it
more
evident
that
we
are
not
obtaining
as
much
as
our
activity
deserves
the
small
amount
of
transport
available
and
the
destruction
by
the
spanish
brigands
of
several
convoys
of
corn
which
were
coming
up
from
the
province
of
valladolid
have
occasioned
delay
in
the
accumulation
of
the
stores
an
additional
vexation
is
that
while
it
was
reported
that
we
had
captured
rations
of
biscuit
in
almeida
there
turn
out
really
to
be
only
but
it
was
the
loss
of
that
was
the
most
serious
trouble
to
his
great
regret
masséna
had
to
cut
down
the
artillery
of
each
division
from
twelve
to
eight
guns
for
want
of
horses
with
a
similar
reduction
of
the
caissons
every
animal
that
could
be
procured
was
given
over
to
the
train
yet
it
could
not
carry
even
the
fifteen
days
food
which
the
marshal
considered
the
minimum
that
he
could
afford
to
take
with
him
there
was
also
a
deficiency
in
cartridges
for
the
infantry
for
whom
rounds
were
only
procured
by
setting
the
artificers
of
the
train
to
make
up
as
many
as
was
possible
from
the
powder
captured
at
ciudad
rodrigo
finally
masséna
explains
that
the
losses
in
the
two
late
sieges
the
necessity
for
garrisoning
almeida
and
rodrigo
and
the
effects
of
a
sickly
summer
have
reduced
the
two
corps
and
the
reserve
cavalry
under
his
hand
to
or
men
so
that
he
must
incorporate
reynier
with
his
main
army
in
order
to
get
a
sufficient
force
concentrated
for
the
invasion
when
this
has
been
done
he
will
have
no
force
to
leave
behind
to
guard
his
communications
and
kellermann
and
serras
are
too
much
occupied
to
spare
a
man
for
that
purpose
the
spaniards
will
press
in
between
the
army
and
salamanca
the
moment
that
the
troops
have
entered
the
portuguese
mountains
he
will
advance
therefore
on
september
but
only
with
grave
apprehension
for
his
rear
and
he
begs
that
at
all
costs
a
division
of
the
corps
should
be
brought
up
to
salamanca
he
had
been
promised
long
ago
that
this
should
be
done
but
no
signs
of
drouet
s
arrival
were
yet
visible
in
the
du
ministère
de
la
see
appendix
to
this
vol
reynier
accordingly
was
called
up
at
last
to
join
the
main
army
he
left
zarza
and
penamacor
on
the
of
september
crossed
the
pass
of
perales
and
on
the
was
at
alfayates
with
cavalry
in
front
at
sabugal
hill
always
vigilant
perceived
reynier
s
movement
as
soon
as
it
had
taken
place
on
the
his
corps
quitted
sarzedas
leaving
nothing
behind
in
the
castello

country
save

were

started
from
the
banks
of

three
days
later
and
on
the
the
two

were
drawing
near
to
wellington

in
the
valley
of
the

at

that
day
and

to
cover
a
march
further
to
the

at

d
aronce
wellington
s
concentration
on
the
alva
must
obviously
be
completed
before
the
french
could
strike
on
september
ney
and
junot
broke
up
from
the
encampments
in
front
of
almeida
while
reynier
drew
in
close
to
the
main
body
by
marching
up
from
sabugal
towards
guarda
it
was
clear
that
the
attack
of
the
french
was
to
be
delivered
along
the
line
of
the
mondego
but
whether
by
its
southern
or
its
northern
bank
wellington
could
not
yet
be
sure
though
he
was
under
the
impression
that
the
former
would
be
the
chosen
route
since
the
from
almeida
by
celorico
and
ponte
de
murcella
is
good
for
a
portuguese
road
while
the
mountain
track
by
trancoso
and
vizeu
is
abominable
yet
one
of
the
three
columns
of
the
french
pointed
from
the
first
towards
the
north
bank
while
ney
took
his
way
by
freixadas
and
alverca
towards
celorico
junot
was
reported
to
have
turned
off
from
the
main
road
at
valverde
and
to
be
marching
by
pinhel
westward
or
what
reynier
would
do
after
reaching
guarda
remained
yet
to
be
seen
the
total
force
which
masséna
had
drawn
together
for
the
invasion
was
officers
and
men
he
had
left
behind
a
regiment
of
dragoons
and
four
battalions
of
infantry
to
take
care
of
almeida
and
ciudad
rodrigo
in
the
latter
place
he
had
also
deposited
his
with
the
considerable
body
of
artillerymen
belonging
to
it
brennier
and
cacault
commanded
at
the
two
places
respectively
they
had
between
them

the

of

whole

this
column
therefore
was
by
far
the
longest
and
owing
to
the
amount
of
guns
and
caissons
the
most
unwieldy
of
the
three
masses
in
which
the
french
were
marching
on

wellington

to
see

s
designs
unmasked
but
it
proved
a
day
of
continued
doubt
reynier
left
heudelet
s
division
at
guarda
and
moved
on
with
merle
s
and
the
cavalry
to
celorico
here
he
met
ney
who
had
marched
from
freixadas
to
celorico
and
had
pushed
his
light
cavalry
through
it
in
advance
one
body
of
horsemen
took
a
hill
road
high
up
the
side
of
the
serra
da
estrella
and
reached
linhares
another
followed
the
great
as
far
as
carapichina
and
detached
a
squadron
or
two
from
that
point
to
seize
the
bridge
of
fornos
d
algodres
over
which
passes
the
bad
from
celorico
to
vizeu
was
the
enemy
about
to
turn
aside
on
this
path
or
to
pursue
the
more
probable
policy
of
continuing
along
the
to
ponte
de
murcella
nothing
could
yet
be
deduced
from
junot
s
movements
his
heavy
column
only
reached
pinhel
that
day
from
thence
he
might
either
come
down
to
celorico
the
most
probable
course
or
make
a
move
towards
oporto
by
the
joão
da
pesqueira
or
what
seemed
least
likely
follow
the
very
bad
from
pinhel
by
povoa
d
el
rei
to
trancoso
and
vizeu
meanwhile
wellington
ordered
the
continuation
of
the
retreat
of
his
army
towards
ponte
de
murcella
and
the
position
behind
the
alva
the
and
divisions
retired
at
their
leisure
along
the
great
by
saragoça
and
chamusca
the
light
division
moved
parallel
to
them
by
the
romão
the
appearance
of
ney
s
cavalry
at
linhares
on
this
track
made
the
anxious
to
have
it
watched
since
it
was
possible
that
the
corps
might
use
it
the
cavalry
keeping
the
rear
well
guarded
lay
this
day
at
pinhanços
on
the
and
san
martinho
on
the
head
quarters
were
at
cea
on
the
latter
line
the
only
troops
now
left
north
of
the
mondego
on
the
route
which
junot
might
possibly
follow
from
pinhel
were
a
few
wherefore
the
conceiving
it
just
possible
that
the
corps
might
be
intending
to
make
a
dash
at
oporto
while
the
other
two
kept
him
in
check
sent
urgent
letters
to
trant
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
militia
of
northern
beira
and
to
baccelar
who
lay
at
oporto
with
the
militia
of
the
to
take
precautions
against
this
movement
trant
from
moimento
de
beira
was
to
feel
for
junot
s
front
and
flank
baccelar
was
to
send
out
some
picked
battalions
under
wilson
to
the
line
of
the
vouga
and
to
get
into
touch
with
trant
on
his
left
on
the
masséna
s
intentions
at
last
became
clear
to
his
adversary
the
cavalry
of
the
corps
crossed
the
bridge
of
fornos
which
it
had
seized
on
the
previous
night
and
the
leading
division
of
infantry
followed
it
to
juncaes
on
the
mondego
bank
nothing
came
along
the
all
the
french
columns
turning
off
it
at
carapichina
and
pursuing
the
ney
s
rear
was
still
at
celorico
to
which
place
the
whole
of
the
corps
also
came
up
that
day
in
the
evening
the
head
of
the
cavalry
of
the
corps
was
near
mangualde
many
miles
along
the
road
north
of
the
mondego
it
seemed
probable
therefore
that
a
transference
of
the
whole
french
army
to
the
right
bank
over
the
bridge
of
fornos
was
about
to
take
place
this
became
almost
certain
when
the
simultaneous
news
arrived
that
junot
had
marched
that
day
from
pinhel
not
towards
celorico
nor
on
the
oporto
road
that
by
marialva
and
joão
da
pesqueira
but
by
the
abominable
by
povoa
d
el
rei
to
trancoso
the
and
corps
therefore
were
showing
a
tendency
to
converge
on
vizeu
if
so
they
must
be
aiming
at
reaching
coimbra
without
touching
wellington
s
chosen
position
of
ponte
de
murcella
where
he
had
hoped
to
fight
this
deduction
once
made
the
british
commander
had
to
recast
his
plans
the
and
corps
came
to
celorico
yesterday
he
wrote
to
leith
that
evening
and
a
part
of
them
crossed
the
mondego
at
fornos
more
have
crossed
this
day
while
no
part
of
the
enemy
s
army
has
moved
this
way
along
the
great
south
of
the
river
it
is
generally
understood
that
their
whole
army
is
between
the
douro
and
the
mondego
and
that
they
are
about
to
move
on
coimbra
i
shall
have
troops
in
coimbra
all
the
divisions
were
ordered
back
at
once
so
as
to
be
ready
on
the
lower
mondego
to
resist
the
french
when
they
should
appear
from
the
direction
of
vizeu
only
cavalry
were
left
at
sampayo
and
gouvea
to
watch
the
passage
of
the
mondego
by
the
french
army
and
to
make
certain
that
its
rear
reynier
s
corps
might
not
be
about
to
use
the
main
a
move
which
was
even
yet
possible
to
cotton
and
to
leith
both
dated
masséna
s
resolve
to
use
the
route
by
the
north
bank
of
the
mondego
surprised
all
british
and
some
french
observers
at
the
time
and
has
been
censured
by
most
historical
critics
he
left
a
good
for
a
bad
road
he
imposed
two
extra
marches
on
his
army
at
a
moment
when
it
was
short
of
provisions
he
gave
wellington
ample
time
to
call
up
hill
and
leith
and
to
select
a
new
position
for
battle
to
replace
that
of
ponte
de
murcella
the
bussaco
hillsides
where
the
clash
was
to
come
were
as
formidable
as
those
behind
the
alva
but
these
considerations
were
less
obvious
to
masséna
in
than
they
appear
to
the
critic
of
it
must
first
be
remembered
that
his
maps
were
abominable
the
actual
case
of
plans
used
by
the
staff
of
the
army
of
portugal
is
preserved
it
is
that
issued
by
lopez
in
which
in
the
remoter
parts
of
portugal
not
only
offers
a
mere
travesty
of
the
natural
features
but
actually
marks
as
existing
roads
that
never
had
been
made
and
omits
others
that
were
actually
available
it
shows
moreover
no
distinction
between
country
roads
and
mere
mule
tracts
places
of
considerable
importance
are
misplaced
by
several
miles
almeida
is
placed
on
the
coa
instead
of
two
miles
from
it
vizeu
is
much
too
far
north
as
is
also
bussaco
as
far
as
this
map
goes
the
physical
difficulties
in
the
way
of
an
advance
north
of
the
mondego
look
no
greater
than
those
on
the
southern
bank
but
it
may
be
said
masséna
should
have
supplemented
the
use
of
the
map
by
collecting
oral
information
and
by
sending
reconnaissances
in
every
direction
he
did
so
so
far
as
was
in
his
power
but
exploration
far
afield
was
only
possible
with
large
bodies
of
men
since
the
ordenança
blocked
every
road
to
the
isolated
and
the
only
oral
information
which
was
forthcoming
was
defective
masséna
asked
for
it
from
alorna
pamplona
and
the
other
portuguese
officers
on
his
staff
there
were
no
less
than
eighteen
of
them
in
all
they
were
absolutely
ignorant
of
their
own
country
a
normal
thing
in
the
military
men
of
the
old
portuguese
army
even
pamplona
whose
estates
lay
in
the
neighbourhood
of
coimbra
gave
hopelessly
erroneous
information
about
the
routes
leading
into
that
town
but
from
natural
they
avoided
confessing
their
ignorance
and
when
taken
into
council
by
masséna
gave
him
copious
but
wholly
misleading
details
they
assured
him
that
the
roads
and
were
no
worse
than
other
lines
of
communication
and
that
the
great
by
sampayo
and
ponte
de
murcella
was
crossed
by
so
many
torrents
and
climbed
so
many
slopes
that
it
was
not
preferable
to
the
routes
north
of
the
river
the
news
that
a
formidable
position
behind
the
alva
had
been
entrenched
had
reached
the
french
head
quarters
hence
masséna
had
fair
reasons
for
taking
the
route
that
he
selected
so
far
as
strategy
went
it
undoubtedly
enabled
him
to
turn
the
line
of
the
alva
moreover
on
it
lay
a
large
town
vizeu
from
which
it
was
hoped
that
much
food
would
be
procured
for
the
invaders
were
still
ignorant
of
the
thoroughness
with
which
wellington
s
plans
for
devastating
the
country
before
them
had
been
carried
out
even
after
celorico
and
guarda
had
been
found
empty
of
inhabitants
they
hardly
believed
that
such
a
large
place
as
vizeu
a
town
of
souls
would
be
deserted
for
a
most
interesting
article
on
these
maps
and
all
that
they
show

maps

at
vittoria

library
of

s
college
belfast
masséna
s
mistake
became
evident
to
his
soldiers
on
the
first
day
on
which
he
ordered
his
columns
to
quit
the
and
take
to
the
the
infantry
could
still
get
forward
but
the
artillery
and
began
to
drag
behind
to
lose
horses
and
to
see
vehicle
after
vehicle
broken
disabled
or
abandoned
on
the
the
infantry
of
the
corps
got
as
far
as
mangualde
on
the
north
bank
of
the
mondego
but
the
artillery
was
so
much
delayed
in
the
defile
after
passing
juncaes
that
it
could
not
catch
up
the
rear
of
the
marching
troops
and
had
to
be
parked
at
night
not
many
miles
beyond
the
bridge
of
fornos
the
corps
on
reaching
this
spot
found
the
road
blocked
and
bivouacked
with
one
division
beyond
the
mondego
and
one
still
in
the
rear
of
the
bridge
but
the
troubles
of
this
column
were
nothing
to
those
of
the
corps
on
the
miserable
road
from
pinhel
to
vizeu
the
journal
of
the
commandant
of
the
artillery
of
junot
s
first
division
colonel
noël
may
be
quoted
as
giving
a
fair
description
of
the
marches
of
the
and
september
after
passing
the
little
town
of
trancoso
with
its
battlemented
wall
all
the
is
mountain
and
rock
there
is
no
road
only
a
stony
narrow
dangerous
track
which
the
artillery
had
all
the
pains
in
the
world
to
follow
without
meeting
accidents
it
is
all
steep
ups
and
downs
i
had
to
march
with
a
party
of
gunners
ahead
of
me
with
picks
and
crowbars
to
enlarge
the
track
as
each
arm
only
looked
out
for
itself
the
artillery
soon
got
left
to
the
rear
and
deserted
by
the
infantry
and
cavalry
we
only
arrived
at
our
late
at
night
utterly
done
up
the
guns
were
almost
always
abandoned
to
themselves
we
did
not
know
what
road
to
follow
having
no
one
to
give
us
information
but
a
few
infantry
stragglers
who
had
themselves
lost
their
way
at
noon
on
the
i
halted
with
my
two
batteries
after
two
hours
of
incessant
uphill
to
find
myself
at
the
crest
of
a
mountain
with
a
precipitous
descent
before
me
and
beyond
that
another
ascent
winding
upwards
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
we
were
so
exhausted
that
it
was
useless
to
go
further
that
day
but
on
the
with
a
party
of
gunners
always
working
in
front
to
enlarge
the
road
we
moved
over
hill
and
vale
completely
out
of
touch
with
the
army
i
had
to
ride
out
with
four
mounted
men
to
hunt
for
any
trace
of
it
at
last
in
a
deserted
village
we
found
an
old
peasant
who
pointed
out
the
road
to
vizeu
but
it
was
only
on
the
that
we
got
noël
s
batteries
it
may
be
remarked
were
moving
all
the
time
between
the
infantry
which
was
ahead
and
the
grand
park
which
was
behind
them
with
montbrun
s
cavalry
bringing
up
the
rear
yet
they
were
absolutely
lost
and
had
to
shift
for
themselves
without
orders
or
escort
of
noël
pp
the
park
fared
even
worse
when
nearing
sotojal
on
the
it
was
unexpectedly
beset
by
colonel
trant
who
had
come
down
from
moimenta
with
a
brigade
of
his
militia
and
two
squadrons
of
portuguese
regular
cavalry
the
park
was
escorted
by
one
company
of
grenadiers
who
marched
at
its
head
and
a
battalion
of
the
irish
legion
who
were
far
to
the
rear
while
montbrun
s
immense
cavalry
column
was
quite
out
of
sight
trant
had
a
great
opportunity
for
the
long
file
of
vehicles
and
guns
caught
in
a
narrow
road
was
almost
helpless
but
he
failed
to
do
all
that
was
in
his
power
his
cavalry
charged
the
company
at
the
head
of
the
column
and
was
repulsed
he
then
filed
his
battalions
along
the
hillside
opened
fire
on
the
horses
and
men
of
the
train
and
descending
into
their
midst
captured
and
destroyed
some
caissons
and
took
some
eighty
prisoners
but
when
the
came
hurrying
up
from
the
rear
his
levies
were
stricken
with
panic
and
hastily
retired
though
they
were
strong
enough
to
have
held
off
the
five
hundred
irish
and
to
have
smashed
or
rolled
over
the
precipices
the
greater
part
of
the
guns
and
waggons
montbrun
s
cavalry
did
not
get
up
till
all
was
over
and
would
have
been
perfectly
useless
on
the
precipitous
road
even
if
they
had
arrived
earlier
if
trant
s
foray
had
been
properly
carried
out
masséna
might
have
lost
his
reserve
artillery
and
most
of
his
provisions
a
disaster
which
might
have
forced
him
to
turn
back
to
almeida
he
deserved
such
a
punishment
for
having
marched
his
train
on
the
extreme
flank
of
his
army
with
an
insufficient
escort
a
lively
account
of
this
affair
may
be
found
in
marbot
ii
details
may
not
be
all
trustworthy
but
the
general
narrative
agrees
with
trant
s
report
printed
in
soriano
da
luz
vol
vii
appendix
though
junot
s
infantry
divisions
reached
the
deserted
walls
of
vizeu
on
and
there
met
the
corps
of
ney
the
divisional
artillery
did
not
arrive
till
next
day
while
the
reserve
artillery
the
trains
and
the
heavy
cavalry
were
struggling
in
upon
the
and
by
detachments
for
montbrun
had
halted
the
great
convoy
after
trant
s
attack
and
parked
it
fearing
that
the
portuguese
might
come
back
in
greater
numbers
and
give
more
trouble
when
he
started
it
again
on
the
he
took
care
to
give
it
better
marching
arrangements
and
to
attach
cavalry
escorts
to
each
section
but
this
caused
much
delay
and
meanwhile
the
corps
waited
at
vizeu
marking
time
and
unable
to
move
even
the
corps
remained
there
two
days
waiting
while
its
and
cannons
were
being
repaired
for
the
road
though
infinitely
less
rough
than
that
which
the
corps
and
the
park
had
followed
was
still
bad
enough
to
shake
many
vehicles
to
pieces
the
reported
that
nineteen
caissons
carrying
rations
of
biscuit
belonging
to
the
corps
broke
down
and
had
to
be
burnt
the
food
was
distributed
among
the
regiments
as
they
passed
with
much
consequent
waste
all
that
ney
could
do
between
the
of
september
when
he
reached
vizeu
and
the
was
to
push
forward
an
advanced
guard
to
tondella
fifteen
miles
down
the
road
with
an
infantry
division
in
support
at
fail
meanwhile
the
corps
following
in
the
wake
of
the
had
also
made
its
way
to
vizeu
the
bulk
of
reynier
s
force
took
the
route
as
ney
s
had
done
but
an
advanced
guard
of
all
arms
descended
the
great
south
of
the
river
as
far
as
taboa
driving
in
the
pickets
of
the
english
cavalry
and
then
crossed
the
mondego
at
the
bridge
of
taboa
and
fell
into
the
rear
of
the
rest
of
the
corps
beyond
mangualde
this
apparently
was
intended
to
keep
wellington
uncertain
as
long
as
possible
as
to
whether
part
of
the
french
army
was
not
intending
after
all
to
follow
the
and
present
itself
before
the
position
on
the
alva
but
it
was
executed
by
so
small
a
force
that
the
british
general
was
not
for
an
hour
deceived
he
was
at
this
moment
in
a
cheerful
frame
of
mind
masséna
had
made
a
mistake
in
choosing
his
route
and
was
merely
wasting
time
when
time
was
most
precious
there
are
certainly
many
bad
roads
in
portugal
he
wrote
but
the
enemy
has
taken
decidedly
the
worst
in
the
whole
kingdom
and
again
i
imagine
that
marshal
masséna
has
been
misinformed
and
has
experienced
more
difficulty
in
making
his
movement
than
he
expected
he
has
certainly
selected
one
of
the
worst
roads
in
portugal
for
his
march
owing
to
the
necessary
delays
of
the
enemy
wellington
was
now
in
a
position
as
strong
as
that
on
the
alva
his
head
quarters
were
at
the
convent
of
bussaco
his
divisions
including
leith
and
hill
so
placed
that
they
could
be
concentrated
on
the
serra
de
alcoba
right
across
the
road
long
before
the
french
could
descend
from
vizeu
we
have
an
excellent
position
here
in
which
i
am
strongly
tempted
to
give
battle
he
wrote
on
the
evening
of
the
foreseeing
six
days
ahead
the
probability
of
the
engagement
which
was
to
make
bussaco
famous
there
was
a
road
by
which
his
position
might
be
turned
but
it
was
doubtful
whether
the
enemy
would
discover
it
and
i
do
not
yet
give
up
hopes
of
discovering
a
remedy
for

misfortune

the
the
plan
of
devastation
was
already
beginning
to
work
masséna
had
exhausted
seven
of
the
thirteen
days
provisions
which
his
army
carried
and
it
was
not
with
the
potatoes
gleaned
in
the
fields
of
vizeu
or
the
ripe
grapes
of
its
vineyards
that
he
could
refill
the
empty
he
must
push
on
for
coimbra
as
fast
as
possible
this
no
doubt
was
why
he
made
up
his
mind
to
march
on
that
place
not
by
descending
from
vizeu
to
aveiro
and
entering
the
coast
plain
but
by
taking
the
direct
road
by
santa
comba
dao
mortagoa
and
bussaco
even
lopez
s
faulty
map
shows
the
ridge
of
bussaco
as
a
serious
physical
feature
but
the
marshal
does
not
seem
to
have
reflected
for
a
moment
that
wellington
might
choose
to
defend
it
the
orders
drawn
up
on
september
for
the
march
on
coimbra
presuppose
an
unobstructed
progress
having
met
no
active
resistance
as
yet
from
the
army
masséna
wrongly
took
it
for
granted
that
he
might
count
on
the
prolongation
of
this
good
fortune
see
the
orders
in
the
du
ministère
de
la
before
moving
on
from
vizeu
the
organization
of
the
french
army
was
slightly
modified
junot
s
corps
contained
a
number
of
fourth
battalions
belonging
to
regiments
whose
three
senior
battalions
were
serving
in
the
corps
the
two
corps
had
never
met
till
both
lay
at
vizeu
masséna
then
ordered
the
fourth
battalions
of
the
of
the
line
and
the
and
léger
to
join
their
regiments
in
reynier
s
corps
this
reduced
the
corps
by
men
in
return
however
reynier
was
ordered
to
make
over
to
junot
two
regiments
of
old
troops
the
and
of
the
line
each
of
three
battalions
making
in
all
bayonets
thus
the
two
corps
were
somewhat
equalized
in
quality
the
receiving
five
battalions
of
recruits
while
the
in
which
there
were
too
few
veterans
got
in
return
six
battalions
which
had
served
in
spain
since
the
commencement
of
the
war
the
net
result
was
to
make
the
corps
a
little
stronger
men
and
the
corps
a
little
weaker
men
it
is
this
interchange
of
troops
which
makes
all
the
figures
of
the
army
of
portugal
so
divergent
fririon
for
example
ignores
it
as
do
most
french
statisticians
but
see
masséna
s
orders
and
the
situations
in
the
of
and
respectively
on
september
the
advance
of
the
army
of
portugal
was
recommenced
though
the
train
and
heavy
baggage
was
not
yet
prepared
to
start
and
some
of
its
rear
detachments
had
not
even
reached
vizeu
but
on
that
day
the
advanced
guard
of
the
corps
advanced
from
tondella
and
found
in
front
of
it
some
light
cavalry
and
two
portuguese
regiments
the
first
hostile
troops
that
the
french
had
seen
since
the
campaign
began
the
whole
of
the
and
corps
followed
behind
and
bivouacked
that
night
at
tondella
sabugoça
and
other
villages
on
the
steep
downward
road
from
vizeu
to
coimbra
the
corps
still
remained
at
vizeu
guarding
the
belated
reserve
artillery
and
train
on
the
the
corps
passing
the
which
had
hitherto
taken
the
lead
crossed
the
criz
and
drove
in
the
british
outposts
who
retired
on
mortagoa
but
ney
and
the
corps
remained
stationary
and
the
did
not
even
yet
make
a
start
these
delays
seem
extraordinary
but
masséna
was
still
paying
for
his
evil
choice
of
roads
the
infantry
had
to
wait
for
the
guns
and
the
guns
could
only
creep
forward
as
the
sappers
enlarged
and
improved
the
roads
for
them
wellington
meanwhile
was
recasting
his
dispositions
at
his
leisure
when
masséna
s
march
on
vizeu
had
become
certain
the
british
thought
at
first
that
the
enemy
would
take
the
good
so
as
to
descend
into
the
and
attack
coimbra
from
the
easiest
side
he
therefore
on
the
moved
the
division
back
from
ponte
de
murcella
to
coimbra
where
it
was
joined
by
a
new
brigade
from
lisbon
composed
of
the
battalions
of
the
and
newly
landed
campbell
s
and
coleman
s
portuguese
also
moved
to
the
same
point
the
and
divisions
remained
at
ponte
de
murcella
in
the
entrenched
position
with
the
light
division
and
pack
s
portuguese
in
front
of
them
at
venda
do
porco
and
sampayo
but
on
the
when
ney
s
advanced
guard
began
to
come
out
from
vizeu
on
the
santa
comba
dao
road
not
on
the
aveiro
road
wellington
discovered
that
it
was
on
the
mountain
of
bussaco
and
not
on
the
plain
in
front
of
coimbra
that
he
would
next
meet
the
enemy
accordingly
pack
s
portuguese
and
the
light
division
forded
the
mondego
below
sampayo
as
did
the
light
cavalry
and
a
detaining
force
was
thus
thrown
across
the
road
the
portuguese
brigade
took
post
behind
the
criz
torrent
craufurd
s
men
a
little
to
the
rear
at
mortagoa
at
the
same
time
the
division
and
the
troops
attached
to
it
moved
out
from
coimbra
to
mealhada
on
the
aveiro
road
a
point
from
which
they
could
easily
be
called
up
to
the
bussaco
position
if
no
french
columns
were
discovered
coming
down
the
aveiro
road
as
now
seemed
probable
this
day
leith
s
division
to
wellington
s
intense
satisfaction
arrived
at
san
miguel
de
payares
behind
the
alva
and
so
joined
the
main
body
hill
was
reported
to
be
a
day
s
march
only
to
the
rear
at
foz
d
aronce
thus
the
whole
of
the
regular
forces
between
douro
and
tagus
were
neatly
concentrated
at
the
same
time
trant
was
told
to
bring
the
militia
of
northern
beira
down
the
road
to
agueda
and
sardão
and
baccelar
was
directed
to
support
him
with
wilson
s
militia
brigade
in
case
masséna
should
have
some
subsidiary
operation
against
oporto
in
his
mind
on
the
the
first
skirmish
of
the
campaign
took
place
the
corps
advancing
into
the
plain
in

of
mortagoa
found
pack
s
portuguese
facing
them
on
the
right
and
craufurd
s
division
on
the
left
with
a
screen
of
cavalry
in
front
they
pushed
in
the
horsemen
upon
the
infantry
but
halted
when
artillery
opened
upon
them
and
made
no
further
advance
on
this
day
the
belated
corps
with
the
reserve
cavalry
at
last
started
from
vizeu
next
morning
reynier
pressed
on
in
force
with
two
heavy
columns
each
formed
by
a
division
and
craufurd
was
ordered
by
wellington
to
retire
which
he
did
with
some
reluctance
by
alternate
échelons
of
brigades
the
and
had
some
sharp
skirmishing
with
the
french
van
and
made
a
stand
by
the
village
of
moura
under
the
bussaco
heights
before
retiring
up
the
and
taking
position
upon
the
crest
of
the
great
ridge
which
they
did
at
six
o
clock
in
the
evening
according
to

craufurd
risked
his
division
somewhat
in
their
skirmish

there
seems
to
be
no
truth
whatever
in

allegation
that

in
a
somewhat
dangerous
position
on
the
evening
of

the

had
only
their
vanguard
up

there
were
less
than
two
hours
of
daylight
left
when
craufurd
retired
from

reynier
and
ney
obtained
their
first
view
of

british
position

could
have
collected

sufficient
for

have
set
in
note
on
the
situation
on

wholly
misrepresents
the
state
of

in
vol

pp
he
writes
as
follows
before
o

french
infantry
were
embattled
on
the
two
points
the
and
the
san
antonio
de
cantaro
road
their
guns
trying
the
range
above
while
the
skirmishing
clatter
of
musketry
arose
from
the
dark
wooded
chasms
below
ney
whose
military
glance
was
sure
instantly
perceived
that
the
mountain
a
crested
not
a
table
one
could
hide
no
great
reserves
that
it
was
only
half
occupied
and
that
the
allies
were
moving
with
the
disorder
usual
on
the
taking
of
unknown
ground
he
wished
therefore
to
attack
but
masséna
was
ten
miles
to
the
rear
the
officer
sent
to
him
waited
two
hours
for
an
audience
and
then
returned
with

to
attend

thus
a
great
opportunity
was
lost

not

scarcely

were
in

and
with
great
almost
every
statement
here
is
incorrect
the
french
did
not
reach
the

in

till

they
were

he
pushed

and
began
to
skirmish
with
our
pickets
it
not
being
lord
wellington
s
intention
to
dispute
this
ground
but
rather
to
entice
masséna
to
follow
and
attack
him
in
his

gradually
withdrawn

up

that

can
not
be
wrong
as
to
the
dating

writing
from

twenty
years
after

not
perceive

half
occupied
and

to
attack
on
the
evening
of
the
his
reconnaissance
was
made
on
the
morning
of

and
it
was
that
he
expressed
his
wish
to
attack
when
wellington
had
every
man
in

this
is
conclusively
proved
by
the

je

que

was

so
much
so
that
wellington
took
two
squadrons
of
cavalry
up
to
it
for
use
in
the
battle
the
british
general
took
up
a
position
where
he
had
no
space

his
reserves
the

the
battle
of

september
it
remains
that
we
should
describe
the
ground
which
wellington
had
chosen
on
the
and
on
which
he
fought
with
such
splendid
success
upon
the
the
ridge
which
takes
its
name
from
the
convent
of
bussaco
is
one
of
the
positions
in
the
whole
iberian
peninsula
a
single
continuous
line
of
heights
covered
with
heather
and
furze
with
the
and
granite
cropping
up
here
and
there
through
the
soil
extends
from
the
mondego
on
the
right
where
it
ends
precipitously
to
the
main
chain
of
the
serra
de
alcoba
on
the
left
the
ridge
is
very
irregular
in
its
altitude
the
two
loftiest
sections
are
one
at
a
distance
of
two
miles
from
the
mondego
and
the
other
to
the
immediate
right
of
the
convent
enclosure
where
the
original
obelisk
commemorating
the
battle
was
set
up
between
these
two
culminating
summits
the
ridge
sinks
down
and
is
at
its
lowest
where
the
from
san
antonio
de
cantaro
to
palheiros
passes
over
it
there
are
three
other
points
where
it
is
crossed
by
lines
of
communication
two
lie
far
to
the
east
not
far
from
the
mondego
where
bad
paths
from
san
paulo
to
palmazes
and
from
carvalhal
to
casal
exist
the
third
and
most
important
is
in
its
left
centre
where
close
to
the
convent
the
from
celorico
to
coimbra
the
main
artery
of
the
local
passes
the
watershed
it
does
so
at
a
place
which
is
by
no
means
the
least
lofty
point
of
the
ridge
but
the
line
was
obvious
to
the
engineer
because
a
spur
the
only
one
of
any
importance
in
the
heights
here
runs
gradually
down
from
the
serra
into
the
lower
ground
to
lead
the
up
the
side
of
this
spur
past
the
village
of
moura
and
so
to
the
crest
of
the
ridge
on
gentle
slopes
was
clearly
better
than
to
make
it
charge
the
main
range
even
at
a
less
lofty
point
the
convent
lies
just
to
the
right
of
the
spot
where
the
passes
the
a
few
hundred
yards
off
the
road
it
was
a
simple
low
quadrangle
with
a
small
chapel
in
its
midst
standing
in
a
fine
wood
of
pine
and
oak
surrounded
by
a
wall
the
wood
is
sprinkled
with
hermitages
picturesque
little
buildings
hewn
in
the
rock
where
those
of
the
monks
who
chose
practised
the
anchorite
s
life
the
outer
wall
of
the
wood
and
the
tops
of
its
trees
are
just
visible
on
the
of
the
main
ridge
the
convent
is
not
being
well
down
the
the
point
where
the
convent
wood
tops
the
heights
is
the
only
section
of
them
where
trees
are
seen
on
the
summit
the
rest
of
the
line
is
bare
heath
with
occasional
outbreaks
of
rock
falling
in
slopes
of
greater
or
lesser
steepness
towards
the
broken
wooded
where
the
french
lay
on
part
of
the
there
is
ground
which
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
describe
as
precipitous
to
the
front
of
the
highest
piece
of
the
ridge
below
the
old
obelisk
the
effect
of
the
whole
line
of
heights
is
not
dissimilar
to
though
on
a
smaller
scale
than
the
malvern
hills
the
highest
point
on
the
serra
is
about
feet
above
but
much
less
of
course
above
the
upland
below
there
are
two
monuments
this
simple
obelisk
on
the
culminating
height
where
the
division
stood
a
point
where
no
fighting
took
place
and
the
modern
column
lower
down
and
close
to
the
behind
the
spot
where
craufurd
fought
here
the
portuguese
to
this
day
maintain
a
small
military
post
and
hoist
a
flag
to
do
honour
to
the
victory
the
position
of
bussaco
is
fully
nine
miles
long
from
end
to
end
from
the
steep
hill
above
the
mondego
to
cole
s
western
flank
this
was
a
vast
front
for
an
army
of
men
to
cover
according
to
the
ideas
of
there
were
absolute
gaps
in
the
line
at
more
than
one
place
especially
above
carvalho
where
about
a
mile
separated
leith
s
left
from
his
central
brigade
the
defence
of
such
a
position
could
only
be
risked
because
of
two
facts
one
was
that
every
movement
of
the
enemy
on
the
lower
ground
before
the
ridge
could
be
accurately
made
out
from
above
he
could
not
concentrate
in
front
of
any
section
of
the
heights
without
being
seen
his
only
chance
of
doing
so
would
have
been
to
take
advantage
of
the
night
but
even
if
he
had
drawn
up
for
the
attack
before
dawn
a
thing
almost
impossible
in
the
broken
wooded
bottoms
he
could
not
have
moved
till
full
daylight
because
the
face
of
the
position
presents
so
many
irregularities
such
as
small
gullies
and
miniature
precipices
that
columns
climbing
in
the
dark
must
undoubtedly
have
got
lost
and
broken
up
on
the
wild
hillside
moreover
there
was
a
thick
cordon
of
british
pickets
pushed
forward
almost
to
the
foot
of
the
ridge
which
would
have
given
warning
by
their
fire
and
their
preliminary
resistance
if
any
advance
had
been
attempted
in
the
grey
dawn
which
makes
astounding
fririon
s
statement
that
it
was
only
of
a
league
long
the
second
advantage
of
the
bussaco
position
is
that
on
its
and
the
ridge
has
a
broad
flat
top
some
or
yards
across
on
which
all
arms
can
move
laterally
with
ease
to
support
any
threatened
point
it
is
so
broad
that
wellington
even
ventured
to
bring
up
a
few
squadrons
of
dragoons
to
the
summit
rightly
arguing
that
a
cavalry
charge
would
be
of
all
things
the
most
unexpected
reception
that
an
enemy
who
had
breasted
such
a
hillside
could
meet
at
the
end
of
his
climb
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
this
section
of
the
heights
was
never
attacked
by
the
french
the
right
of
the
position
is
not
like
the
centre
but
has
a
narrow
breaking
into
outcrops
of
rock
at
intervals
but
though
here
prompt
motion
from
right
to
left
or
left
to
right
is
not
possible
on
the
crest
there
is
a
rough
good
for
infantry
and
available
even
for
guns
a
few
hundred
yards
down
the
reverse
side
of
the
slope
along
this
troops
could
be
moved
with
ease
entirely
out
of
sight
of
the
enemy
it
proved
useful
for
leith
s
division
during
the
battle
wellington
calculated
therefore
with
perfect
correctness
that
he
could
count
on
getting
an
adequate
force
of
defenders
to
any
portion
of
his
long
line
before
the
enemy
could
establish
himself
on
the
summit
the
extreme
left
where
cole
s
division
lay
was
the
hardest
part
of
his
line
to
reinforce
for
want
of
good
lateral
communication
it
was
also
a
good
deal
lower
than
craufurd
s
post
here
therefore
wellington
had
placed
the
main
mass
of
his
reserves
the
german
legion
and
two
portuguese
brigades
were
lying
on
his
very
close
to
the
division
so
that
they
would
be
available
at
short
notice
though
they
would
have
a
stiff
climb
if
the
french
chose
that
section
of
the
position
as
their
objective
and
it
had
to
be
strengthened
in
haste
the
distribution
of
the
army
remains
to
be
described
on
the
extreme
right
on
the
height
of

curious
feature

for
reasons
which
it
is
hard
to
divine
had
not
come
to
the
front
though
he
must
have
heard
the
guns
firing
all
through
the
afternoon
and
had
been
informed
by
reynier
that
the
english
were
standing
at
bay
on
the
bussaco
ridge
he
came
no
further
to
the
front
than
mortagoa
on
the
ney
on
the
morn
of
the
next
day
was
busy
reconnoitring
the
position
he
sent
forward
to
push
in
craufurd
s
outposts
and
ventured
as
far
to
the
front
as
was
possible
so
well
hidden
was
wellington
s
line
that
the
marshal
formed
an
entirely
erroneous
conception
of
what
was
before
him
at
in
the
morning
he
wrote
to
reynier
to
say
that
the
whole
english
army
seemed
to
be
moving
to
its
left
apparently
on
the
road
towards
oporto
but
that
it
had
still
a
rearguard
with
a
dozen
guns
in
position
to
the
right
of
the
park
which
covers
the
convent
apparently
cole
s
division
taking
ground
to
its
left
on
spencer
s
arrival
and
craufurd
on
the
was
all
that
he
had
made
out
he
had
not
discovered
leith
and
the
division
and
could
not
of
course
know
that
spencer
was
at
this
moment
arriving
at
the
convent
and
that
hill
was
across
the
mondego
at
peña
cova
the
marshal
added
that
if
he
had
been
in
chief
command
he
should
have
attacked
whatever
was
in
front
of
him
without
a
moment
s
hesitation
but
things
being
as
they
were
he
thought
that
reynier
would
risk
nothing
by
pushing
forward
on
the
english
right
and
thrusting
back
wellington
s
outposts
for
it
was
desirable
to
make
him
retreat
towards
his
left
it
is
clear
that
ney
if
he
had
possessed
a
free
hand
would
have
brought
on
a
battle
when
he
was
only
intending
to
drive
in
a
rearguard
for
by
on
the
wellington
had
every
man
upon
the
field
whom
he
intended
to
use
in
the
fight
and
would
have
welcomed
an
assault
of
the
french
on
the
other
hand
junot
s
corps
and
the
cavalry
and
artillery
were
still
far
away
to
the
rear
they
only
came
up
in
rear
of
ney
on
the
night
of
the
see
the
letter
quoted
on
page
masséna
on
receiving
ney
s
report
rode
up
to
the
front
at
about
two
o
clock
on
the
a
late
hour
but
he
is
said
to
have
been
employed
in
private
matters
at
mortagoa
when
he
had
at
last
appeared
he
pushed
forward
as
near
to
the
foot
of
the
british
position
as
was
safe
and
reconnoitred
it
with
care
in
the
evening
he
drew
up
orders
for
attacking
the
bussaco
heights
at
their
most
accessible
points
along
the
that
leads
from
moura
up
to
the
convent
and
along
the
from
san
antonio
de
cantaro
to
palheiros
see
marbot
ii
if
that
lively
writer
may
be
trusted
the
prince
of
essling
had
no
hesitation
whatever
about
risking
a
battle
he
had
never
seen
the
english
before
and
held
concerning
them
the
same
views
as
the
other
french
officers
who
had
no
experience
of
wellington
s
army
some
confused
generalization
from
the
misfortunes
of
the
duke
of
york
s
troops
in
and
determined
the
action
of
all
the
marshals
till
they
had
made
personal
acquaintance
with
the
new
enemy
the
english
were
to
be
dealt
with
by
drastic
frontal
attacks
pushed
home
with
real
vigour
it
is
curious
as
napoleon
remarked
soon
after
that
reynier
who
had
been
badly
beaten
by
the
english
at
alexandria
and
maida
had
learnt
no
more
than
the
others
and
committed
exactly
the
same
errors
as
his
colleagues
he
who
had
experience
of
his
adversaries
and
ney
who
had
not
adopted
precisely
the
same
tactics
these
indeed
were
indicated
to
them
by
masséna
s
order
to
attack
in
columns
each
at
least
a
division
strong
preceded
by
a
swarm
of
there
was
no
question
of
a
general
advance
all
along
the
line
the
two
were
directed
to
choose
each
his
point
and
to
break
through
the
british
army
at
it
by
force
of
mass
and
impact
only
two
sections
of
wellington
s
position
were
to
be
touched
there
being
a
long
gap
between
the
objectives
assigned
to
ney
and
to
reynier
but
by
throwing
or
men
in
close
order
at
each
of
the
two
short
fronts
selected
masséna
thought
that
he
could
penetrate
the
thin
line
of
the
defenders
see
foy
s
account
of
his
interview
with
the
emperor
in
his
as
none
of
the
historians
of
the
battle
have
thought
it
worth
while
to
give
the
marshal
s
orders
in
detail
and
many
writers
have
misconceived
or
them
it
is
necessary
to
state
them
the
attacks
of
the
and
corps
were
not
to
be
simultaneous
reynier
having
the
easier
ground
before
him
was
told
to
move
first
he
was
to
select
the
most
accessible
stretch
of
the
hillside
in
his
front
and
to
climb
it
with
his
whole
corps
in
one
or
two
columns
preceded
by
a
skirmishing
line
having
gained
the
crest
and
pierced
the
british
line
he
was
to
his
men
and
then
drop
down
the
reverse
slope
of
the
heights
on
to
the
coimbra
road
along
which
he
was
to
press
in
the
direction
of
the
convent
of
bussaco
toward
the
rear
of
wellington
s
centre
this
unpublished
document
from
the
du
ministère
de
la
seems
to
have
escaped
all
historians
ney
was
directed
not
to
move
till
he
should
have
learnt
that
reynier
had
crowned
the
heights
but
when
he
should
see
the
corps
on
the
crest
was
to
send
forward
two
columns
of
a
division
each
against
the
british
one
division
was
to
follow
the
the
other
to
mount
the
rough
path
up
the
spur
on
which
the
village
of
sula
stands
both
columns
like
those
of
the
corps
were
to
be
preceded
by
a
thick
line
of
skirmishers
they
were
to
halt
and
when
the
crest
of
the
english
position
should
be
carried
and
then
to
adapt
their
movements
to
suit
those
of
reynier
s
corps
junot
was
to
assemble
his
two
infantry
divisions
behind
moura
and
to
have
them
ready
to
reinforce
either
ney
or
reynier
as
might
be
needed
his
artillery
was
to
be
placed
on
the
knolls
on
each
side
of
the
so
as
to
be
able
to
hold
back
the
allied
army
if
after
repulsing
ney
it
should
attempt
a
forward
movement
montbrun
s
cavalry
and
the
reserve
artillery
were
to
be
placed
on
either
side
of
the
behind
junot
s
centre
these
orders
are
printed
in
the
appendix
the
horsemen
were
obviously
useless
save
that
in
the
event
of
wellington
being
defeated
they
could
be
sent
forward
in
pursuit
nor
were
the
guns
much
more
serviceable
they
could
sweep
the
lower
parts
of
the
slopes
of
bussaco
but
could
not
reach
its
crest
with
their
fire
indeed
the
only
french
artillery
used
successfully
on
the
next
day
were
two
batteries
which
ney
s
columns
of
attack
took
with
them
along
the
as
far
as
the
elbow
of
road
in
front
of
moura
these
were
in
effective
range
of
craufurd
s
and
pack
s
troops
since
the
latter
were
on
a
level
with
them
and
not
on
the
highest
crest
of
the
british
position
reynier
s
guns
could
just
reach
the
summit
of
the
pass
of
san
antonio
de
cantaro
but
not
so
as
to
play
upon
it
with
any
good
result
it
is
said
that
junot
and
reynier
were
in
favour
of
trying
the
frontal
attack
which
masséna
had
dictated
as
was
also
laszowski
the
polish
general
who
commanded
the
engineers
of
the
army
fririon
the
chief
of
the
staff
and
eblé
commanding
the
artillery
spoke
against
the
policy
of
taking
the
bull
by
the
masséna
according
to
fririon
turned
on
the
doubters
with
the
words
you
come
from
the
old
army
of
the
rhine
you
like
manœuvring
but
it
is
the
first
time
that
wellington
seems
ready
to
give
battle
and
i
want
to
profit
by
the
opportunity
ney
too
as
we
read
with
some
surprise
is
said
to
have
given
the
opinion
that
it
would
have
been
feasible
to
assault
the
heights
yesterday
but
that
now
when
wellington
had
been
given
time
to
bring
up
his
reserves
and
settle
his
army
down
into
the
most
advantageous
position
the
policy
of
taking
the
offensive
had
become
doubtful
he
therefore
advised
that
the
army
should
turn
aside
and
make
a
stroke
at
oporto
which
would
be
found
unprotected
save
by
militia
masséna
according
to
his
official
biographer
announced
that
the
emperor
had
ordered
him
to
march
on
lisbon
not
on
oporto
this
was
entirely
correct
the
capture
of
lisbon
would
end
the
whole
war
that
of
oporto
would
prolong
it
and
bring
no
decisive
result
moreover
it
was
quite
uncertain
whether
wellington
would
not
be
able
to
prevent
such
a
move
he
has
troops
échelloned
as
far
as
the
vouga
and
he
could
get
to
oporto
in
three
marches
because
he
possesses
the
while
the
french
army
moving
by
worse
roads
would
require
five
marches
to
reach
it
is
suggested
that
ney
s
policy
was
really
to
goad
his
superior
into
making
the
frontal
attack
at
bussaco
by
feigning
to
believe
it
dangerous
and
to
counsel
its
abandonment
for
he
thought
that
masséna
would
do
precisely
the
opposite
of
what
he
was
advised
out
of
his
personal
dislike
for
himself
and
general
distaste
for
having
counsel
thrust
upon
him
if
this
was
so
the
duke
of
elchingen
carried
his
point
to
the
entire
discomfiture
both
of
himself
and
his
so
fririon
in
his
de

his

all

length

described

details

battle
of
bussaco
of
the
troops
at
the
commencement
of
the
french
on
the
after
masséna
had
retired
to
his
head
quarters
at
mortagoa
there
was
a
little
skirmishing
on
the
english
where
reynier
s
advanced
guard
drove
the
light
company
of
the
off
some
knolls
at
the
foot
of
the
heights
opposite
san
antonio
de
cantaro
much
about
the
same
time
there
was
some
bickering
on
ney
s
front
the
pickets
of
pack
s
caçadores
and
craufurd
s
were
attacked
but
held
their
ground
the
contest
was
never
very
serious
and
the
fire
died
down
at
dusk
that
evening
the
british
army
slept
in
order
of
battle
each
man
with
his
firelock
in
his
grasp
at
his
post
there
were
no
fires
and
the
stillness
that
reigned
throughout
the
line
was
only
interrupted
by
the
occasional
challenge
of
an
advanced
sentry
or
a
random
shot
fired
at
some
imaginary
below
and
in
front
all
the
low
hills
behind
moura
and
san
antonio
were
bright
with
the
bivouac
fires
of
the
french
of
which
three
great
masses
could
be
distinguished
marking
the
position
of
the
and
corps
grattan
s
with
the
pp
and
leith
hay
i
the
dawn
of
the
was
somewhat
misty
but
as
soon
as
the
light
was
strong
enough
reynier
commenced
his
attack
he
had
chosen
for
his
objective
as
was
natural
the
lowest
point
of
the
ridge
opposite
him
the
dip
where
the
from
san
antonio
de
cantaro
crosses
the
serra
his
two
divisions
according
to
order
were
drawn
up
in
two
heavy
columns
preceded
by
a
dense
swarm
of
heudelet
s
division
on
the
left
was
across
the
with
the
léger

front
then
the
two
regiments
of
foy
s

the
and
léger
with
the
in
reserve
the
whole
made
battalions
or
men
merle
s
division
had
the
right
and
was
to
attack
north
of
the
road
of
its
eleven
battalions
making
men
the
of
the
line
led
the
léger
followed
the
léger
brought
up
the
rear
all
the
battalions
were
in
serried
column
with
a
front
of
one
company
only
and
in
each
regiment
the
three
or
four
battalions
were
originally
drawn
up
one
behind
the
other
but
the
involuntary
swerving
of
the
attack
soon
turned
the
two
divisions
into
an
irregular
échelon
of
the
right
in
every
case
leading
and
the
roughness
of
the
hillside
soon
broke
the
ordered
ranks
of
each
column
into
a
great
clump
of
men
so
that
to
the
british
defenders
of
the
ridge
the
assault
seemed
to
be
delivered
by
a
string
of
small
crowds
crossing
the
hillside
diagonally
it
is
curious
that
reynier
placed
no
troops
to
his
left
of
the
road
a
study
of
his
orders
as
of
those
of
masséna
leads
to
a
suspicion
that
they
had
failed
to
discover
leith
s
division
and
still
more
hill
s
and
imagined
that
the
road
was
on
the
extreme
right
not
in
the
of
the
british
position
otherwise
reynier
would
have
taken
some
precaution
to
guard
himself
from
a
flank
attack
from
leith
to
which
he
was
deliberately
exposing
his
left
column
masséna
s
orders
for
the
battle
call
reynier
s
attack
one
on
la
droite
de
l
armée
ennemie
but
it
was
really
on
the
hill
and
leith
extending
for
four
miles
south
of
the
point
assailed
there
were
as
has
already
been
pointed
out
several
gaps
in
the
british
line
one
was
between
the
regiment
of
portuguese
on
leith
s
extreme
left
and
the
rest
of
the
division
another
was
between
picton
s
troops
at
the
pass
of
san
antonio
and
his
left
wing
the
and
lightburne
s
brigade
between
the
and
the
there
was
of
a
mile
of
unoccupied
ground
the
first
gap
led
to
no
danger
the
second
caused
for
a
moment
a
serious
crisis
such
was
indeed
almost
bound
to
occur
when
a
line
so
long
was
held
by
such
a
small
army
but
this
morning
there
arose
the
special
danger
that

movements
of
the
enemy
from
the
eye
if
not
from
the
ear
merle
s
division
seems
to
have
been
the
first
of
reynier
s
two
columns
to
move
at
dawn
with
the
mist
lying
thick
on
the
hillside
it
began
to
move
up
the
steep
slope
some
of
a
mile
to
the
right
of
the
san
road
here
its
came
in
contact
with
the
light
companies
of
the
and
regiments
which
were
strung
out
along
the
front
and
soon
began
to
push
this
thin
line
up
hill
for
some
reason
undetermined
a
trick
of
the
mist
or
a
bend
of
the
hillside
the
three
french
regiments
all
headed
somewhat
to
their
left
so
as
to
pass
across
the
front
of
the
and
to
direct
their
advance
precisely
to
the
unoccupied
piece
of
crest
between
that
regiment
and
the
troops
placed
immediately
above
the
pass
of
san
antonio
their
progress
was
slow
the
left
far
behind
them
the
eleven
which
were
trampling
through
the
dense
matted
heather
which
here
covers
the
hillside
hearing
the
bicker
of
the
skirmishing
far
to
his
left
picton
took
the
alarm
and
though
he
could
see
nothing
in
the
fog
detached
first
a
wing
of
the
under
major
gwynne
and
then
the
two
battalions
of
the
portuguese
to
fill
the
unoccupied
space
which
intervened
between
him
and
the
if
he
had
suspected
the
strength
of
the
column
that
was
aiming
at
it
he
would
have
sent
more
but
he
was
already
distracted
by
the
frontal
attack
of
heudelet
s
vanguard
along
the
a
column
of
four
battalions
the
léger
was
pushing
up
the
road
and
driving
in
the
skirmishers
of
champlemond
s
portuguese
brigade
just
at
this
moment
the
mist
began
to
lift
and
arentschildt
s
guns
opened
on
the
broad
mass
and
began
to
plough
long
lanes
through
it
it
still
advanced
but
was
soon
brought
to
a
standstill
by
the
fire
of
the
british
and
portuguese
which
were
drawn
up
in
line
to
right
and
left
a
little
below
the
guns
the
léger
tried
to
deploy
but
with
small
success
each
section
being
swept
away
by
the
converging
fire
of
the
musketry
as
it
strove
to
file
out
of
the
disordered
mass
nevertheless
the
french
regiment
gallantly
held
its
ground
for
some
time
shifting
gradually
towards
its
right
to
avoid
the
fire
of
the
guns
and
gaining
a
little
of
the
hillside
in
that
direction
with
its
first
battalion
while
the
other
three
were
tending
to
edge
away
from
the
road
and
to
break
up
into
a
shapeless
crowd
the
of
lemonnier
delafosse
a
captain
in
the
léger
give
an
excellent
and
clear
account
of
its
sufferings
see
pp
of
his
work
picton
soon
saw
that
there
was
no
danger
here
handed
over
the
command
at
the
pass
of
san
antonio
to
mackinnon
and
started
off
towards
his
left
where
the
firing
was
growing
heavier
every
minute
and
the
vast
column
of
merle
s
division
climbing
the
hillside
diagonally
had
become
visible
through
the
mist
it
was
fortunate
that
the
attack
of
merle
was
made
very
slow
by
the
steepness
of
the
hillside
and
the
heather
that
clung
about
the
soldiers
stumbling
feet
for
the
leading
regiment
reached
the
crest
before
there
were
any
british
troops
yet
established
on
the
point
at
which
it
aimed
it
was
lurching
over
the
on
to
the
little
plateau
above
just
as
the
defenders
arrived
the
descending
from
the
british
left
the
wing
of
the
and
the
two
battalions
of
the
portuguese
coming
along
the
from
the
right
if
the
french
had
been
granted
ten
minutes
to
rest
from
the
fatigue
of
their
long
climb
and
to
recover
their
order
they
might
have
broken
the
british
line
but
wallace
the
commander
of
the
was
one
of
wellington
s
best
colonels
the
very
man
for
the
emergency
seeing
that
the
french
must
be
charged
at
once
ere
they
had
time
to
make
a
front
he
threw
out
three
of
his
companies
as
skirmishers
to
cover
his
flanks
called
to
the
wing
of
the
to
fall
in
on
his
right
and
charged
diagonally
across
the
little
plateau
on
to
the
flank
of
the
great
disordered
mass
before
him
at
the
same
moment
the
portuguese
a
little
further
along
the
hilltop
deployed
and
opened
a
rolling
fire
against
the
front
of
the
enemy
while
wellington
himself
who
had
been
called
down
from
his
post
of
observation
on
the
convent
height
by
the
noise
of
the
fighting
came
up
with
two
of
thompson
s
guns
and
turned
their
fire
upon
the
flank
and
rear
of
the
climbing
mass
which
was
still
surging
up
the
hillside
apparently
at
the
same
instant
the
light
companies
of
the
and
which
had
been
engaged
in
the
earlier
skirmishing
with
the
french
and
had
been
driven
far
away
to
their
right
were
rallied
by
picton
in
person
and
brought
up
along
the
plateau
to
the
right
of
the
portuguese
they
drew
up
only
sixty
yards
from
the
flank
of
the
leading
french
regiment
and
opened
a
rolling
fire
upon
it
at
any
other
juncture
and
on
any
other
ground
four
battalions
would
have
been
helpless
against
eleven
but
wallace
had
caught
the
psychological
moment
the
french
dead
beat
from
its
climb
and
in
hopeless
disorder
was
violently
charged
in
flank
by
the
connaught
rangers
and
the
wing
of
the
while
it
was
just
gathering
itself
up
to
run
in
upon
the
portuguese
battalions
that
lay
in
its
front
the
french
had
no
time
to
realize
their
position
or
to
mark
the
smallness
of
the
force
opposed
to
them
when
the
blow
fell
the
four
battalions
of
the
were
rolled
down
hill
and
to
their
left
by
the
blasting
fire
of
wallace
s
little
force
followed
by
a
desperate
bayonet
charge
they
were
thrust
sideways
against
the
léger
which
was
just
reaching
the
on
their
left
and
was
beginning
to
struggle
in
among
some
rocks
which
here
crown
the
crest
of
the
heights
then
the
whole
mass
gave
way
trampled
down
the
léger
in
their
rear
and
rushed
down
the
slope
all
was
confusion
and
uproar
smoke
fire
and
bullets
french
officers
and
soldiers
drummers
and
drums
knocked
down
in
every
direction
british
french
and
portuguese
mixed
together
while
in
the
midst
of
all
was
to
be
seen
wallace
fighting
like
his
ancestor
of
old
and
still
calling
to
his
soldiers
to
press
he
never
slackened
his
fire
while
a
frenchman
was
within
his
reach
and
followed
them
down
to
the
edge
of
the
hill
where
he
formed
his
men
in
line
waiting
for
any
order
that
he
might
receive
or
any
fresh
body
that
might
attack
him
this
was
certainly
one
of
the
most
timely
and
gallant
strokes
made
by
a
regimental
commander
during
the
war
and
the
glory
was
all
wallace
s
own
as
picton
very
handsomely
owned
the
colonel
of
the
and
major
gwynne
of
the
are
entitled
to
the
whole
of
the
credit
he
wrote
to
wellington
and
i
can
claim
no
merit
whatever
in
the
executive
part
of
that
brilliant
exploit
which
your
lordship
has
so
highly
and
so
justly
extolled
grattan
s
with
the
connaught
picton
to
wellington
vi
i
do
not
know
whether
wallace
really
descended
from
the
famous
sir
william
but
craufurd
of
the
light
division
as
his
descendant
and
biographer
has
pointed
out
to
me
chanced
to
have
a
connexion
with
the
knight
of
ellerslie
the
victorious
british
troops
followed
the
enemy
far
down
the
hillside
till
they
came
under
the
fire
of
reynier
s
artillery
and
were
warned
to
retire
to
their
former
position
they
thus
missed
the
last
episode
of
reynier
s
attack
which
occurred
along
the
hillside
just
to
the
left
of
the
point
at
which
their
collision
with
merle
s
battalions
had
taken
place
the
commander
of
the
corps
seeing
his
right
column
rolling
down
the
slope
while
the
was
melting
away
and
gradually
giving
ground
under
the
fire
of
the
troops
at
the
pass
of
san
antonio
hurried
to
foy
s
brigade
and
started
it
up
the
hill
to
the
right
of
the
foy
had
been
told
to
support
that
regiment
but
had
taken
reynier
s
orders
to
mean
that
he
was
to
follow
up
its
advance
when
it
began
to
make
headway
his
cantered
up
to
him
shouting
angrily
why
don
t
you
start
on
the
climb
you
could
get
the
troops
forward
if
you
choose
but
you
don
t
whereupon
foy
rode
to
the
leading
regiment
of
his
brigade
the
léger
put
himself
at
its
head
and
began
to
ascend
the
heights
his
other
regiment
the
following
in
échelon
on
his
left
rear
at
this
moment
merle
s
division
was
still
visible
falling
back
in
great
disorder
some
way
to
the
right
and
pursued
by
wallace
a
discouraging
sight
for
the
seven
battalions
that
were
about
to
repeat
its
experiment
foy
chose
as
his
objective
the
first
and
lowest
hilltop
to
the
french
right
of
the
pass
of
san
antonio
and
took
his
string
of
columns
the
right
always
leading
up
towards
it
at
such
pace
as
was
possible
over
the
long
heather
and
among
the
occasional
patches
of
stones
the
troops
which
were
in
front
of
them
here
were
those
sections
of
picton
s
division
which
were
neither
far
away
on
the
english
left
with
wallace
and
lightburne
nor
actively
engaged
on
the
road
against
the
léger
viz
the
right
wing
of
the
british
under
colonel
meade
and
the
portuguese
of
the
line
which
had
just
been
aiding
in
the
repulse
of
merle
these
were
soon
afterwards
joined
by
one
battalion
of
the
portuguese
from
champlemond
s
brigade
and
the
unattached
battalion
of
thomar
militia
which
picton
sent
up
the
hill
yet
this
was
still
far
too
small
a
force
to
resist
foy
s
seven
battalions
unless
speedily
supported
but
support
in
sufficient
quantity
was
forthcoming
general
leith
had
received
orders
from
wellington
to
close
in
to
picton
s
right
if
he
saw
no
hostile
troops
in
his
own
front
as
it
was
clear
that
reynier
had
kept
no
reserves
or
flanking
detachments
to
the
south
of
the
it
was
possible
for
the
division
to
move
at
once
while
the
fog
was
still
hanging
thickly
along
the
crests
of
the
serra
leith
ordered
a
general
move
of
his
brigades
to
the
left
while
hill
detached
troops
from
the
southern
end
of
the
position
to
occupy
the
heights
which
the
division
was
evacuating
this
general
move
to
the
left
was
carried
out
along
the
rough
but
serviceable
which
passes
along
the
rear
of
the
plateau
out
of
sight
of
the
french
at
the
moment
when
foy
s
attack
was
beginning
leith
had
just
reached
the
pass
of
san
antonio
with
spry
s
portuguese
brigade
at
the
head
of
his
column
then
the
two
battalions
of
the
lusitanian
legion
and
lastly
barnes
s
british
brigade
one
of
dickson
s
portuguese
batteries
was
also
with
him
he
dropped
the
guns
at
the
pass
to
aid
arentschildt
s
battery
whose
fire
was
beginning
to
slacken
from
want
of
ammunition
and
left
spry
in
their
rear
and
the
legionary
battalions
on
the
hard
by
while
he
brought
up
barnes
s
brigade
to
the
front
and
reported
his
arrival
to
picton
the
latter
said
it
appears
that
he
was
strong
enough
at
the
pass
but
would
be
obliged
if
leith
would
attend
to
the
attack
which
was
being
made
at
this
moment
on
the
height
to
its
immediate
left
this
movement
of
foy
s
was
now
becoming
dangerous
forcing
his
way
to
the
summit
under
a
destructive
fire
he
had
met
on
the
edge
of
the
plateau
the
three
portuguese
battalions
and
the
wing
of
the
british
and
had
driven
them
back
the
thomar
militia
broke
and
fled
down
the
rear
declivity
of
the
heights
and
the
portuguese
though
they
did
not
fly
gave
way
and
fell
back
in
disorder
just
at
this
moment
leith
with
barnes
s
three
battalions
came
up
along
the
at
the
back
of
the
plateau
a
heavy
fire
of
musketry
writes
leith
was
being
kept
up
upon
the
heights
the
smoke
of
which
prevented
a
clear
view
of
the
state
of
things
but
when
the
rock
forming
the
high
part
of
the
serra
became
visible
the
enemy
appeared
to
be
in
full
possession
of
it
and
a
french
officer
was
in
the
act
of
cheering
with
his
hat
off
while
a
continued
fire
was
being
kept
up
from
thence
and
along
the
whole
face
of
the
slope
of
the
serra
in
a
diagonal
direction
towards
its
bottom
by
the
enemy
ascending
rapidly
in
successive
columns
formed
for
an
attack
upon
a
mass
of
men
belonging
to
the
left
battalion
of
the
and
the
portuguese
who
having
been
severely
pressed
had
given
way
and
were
rapidly
retiring
in
complete
confusion
and
disorder
the
enemy

dispersed
or
driven
off
everything

leith

explored
all
the

in
this
direction
on
the
previous
afternoon
with

squadron
of

i
picton
and
leith
each
rather
slur
over
the
part
taken
by
the
other
in
their
parallel
narratives
of
the
crisis
picton
says
that
he
took
command
of
leith
s
troops
at
this
moment
leith
s
came
up
to
report
the
arrival
of
that
general
and
his
division
on
which
i
rode
from
the
post
of
san
antonio
to
the
road
of
communication
and
directed
the
leading
regiment
of
the
brigade
to
proceed
without
loss
of
time
to
the
left
as
i
had
no
occasion
for
assistance
general
leith
s
brigade
in
consequence
moved
on
and
arrived
in
time
to
join
the
five
companies
of
the
and
the
portuguese
in
repulsing
the
enemy
s
last
leith
on
the
other
hand
speaks
of
having
taken
command
of
some
of
picton
s
troops
as
if
the
latter
had
not
been
present
and
says
nought
of
their
conversation
leith
thereupon
directed
a
movement
of
succession
ordering
colonel
douglas
with
the
right
battalion
of
the
portuguese
to
support
the
point
attacked
he
also
directed
the
portuguese
under
colonel
sutton
belonging
to
picton
s
division
to
move
up
to
the
support
of
general
picton
s
division
and
again
he
general
leith
ordered
the
and
portuguese
to
support
the
point
attacked
and
where
the
enemy
were
fast
gaining
each
general
speaks
as
if
he
had
been
in
command
and
i
fear
that
each
is
using
undue
reticence
as
to
the
other
s
doings
see
note
at
the
end
of
this
chapter
leith
realizing
that
there
was
still
time
to
save
the
position
for
only
the
head
of
the
french
column
had
crowned
the
rocky
knoll
deployed
his
leading
battalion
the
across
the
summit
of
the
plateau
while
sending
on
his
second
the
to
get
between
the
enemy
and
the
reverse
slope
of
the
position
this
last
move
turned
out
to
be
fruitless
for
the
rear
face
of
the
knoll
is
so
steep
and
so
thickly
covered
with
large
boulders
that
the
was
unable
to
climb
it
and
came
back
to
fall
in
on
the
right
of
the
but
before
it
could
get
back
the
senior
regiment
had
done
its
work
leith
had
led
it
diagonally
across
the
plateau
so
as
to
place
it
along
the
flank

the
leading

yards

then
advanced

receiving
hardly
any

from

seemed

disconcerted
by
the
appearance
of
a
new
force

with
its

twenty
yards
from

lowered

reproaches
heaped
upon

who
have
not
read
his
orders
for
attacking
too
late

not
at

he
was
told

showed

massed
on

the

as
far
as

much
cut
up

whose

strenuous
use

were
evicted
first
from

then
from

when

found
themselves
under

heavy
fire
of
artillery

once
more
taking

sent
down

only
with

formed
the
boundary
of

at

wheeled

as

as

till
loison
s
people
had
taken
refuge
in
the
wooded
ground
beyond
that
village
and
the
french
guns
by
moura
had
begun
to
play
upon

carried
away
the

which
had
moved
so
far
down
in

this

a
passage
of
napier
s
account
of
the
movements
of
the
light
division
iii
has
puzzled
many
readers
eighteen
hundred
british
bayonets
went
sparkling
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
yet
so
hardy
were
the
leading
french
that
every
man
of
the
first
section
raised
his
musket
and
two
officers
and
ten
soldiers
of
the
fell
before
them
not
a
frenchman
had
missed
his
mark
this
passage
looks
as
if
the
whole
french
division
had
been
conceived
by
napier
as
moving
in
a
single
column
with
a
front
of
only
twelve
men
an
sir
john
bell
of
the
who
owned
the
copy
of
the
book
which
i
now
have
before
me
has
written
bosh
in
the
margin
against
the
words
of
course
the
enemy
was
advancing
with
each
battalion
in
column
of
companies
with
a
front
of
thirty
at
least
what
napier
seems
to
have
had
in
his
head
was
an
anecdote
told
by
his
brother
george
my
company
met
the
very
head
of
the
french
column
and
immediately
calling
to
my
men
to
form
column
of
sections
in
order
to
give
more
force
to
our
rush
we
dashed
forward
i
was
in
front
of
my
men
a
yard
or
two
when
a
frenchman
made
a
plunge
at
me
with
his
bayonet
and
at
the
same
time
received
the
contents
of
his
musket
under
my
hip
and
fell
at
the
same
instant
they
fired
upon
my
front
section
consisting
of
about
nine
men
in
the
front
rank
all
of
whom
fell
four
dead
the
rest
but
this
does
not
imply
that
the
french
column
was
only
twelve
broad
this
made
an
end
of
loison
s
two
brigades
as
a
serious
attacking
force
they
reeled
back
to
their
original
position
under
cover
of
the
léger
which
mermet
sent
out
to
relieve
them
but
later
in
the
day
they
pushed
some
skirmishers
up

again

of

was
so
galling
that
the

apparently
without

by
an
instinctive
movement
swerved
to

went
up

an
account
of

detached
with
these

on
of
his

he
lost

it
must
have
been
in
contending
with
these
companies
that
the
division
excluding
the
german
brigade
occupied
elsewhere
got
the
casualties
returned
by
wellington
as
also
the
their
casualties
the
only
one
of
the
british
battalions
in
this
quarter
which
had
an
appreciable
number
of
men
hurt
was
the
its
regimental
history
says
that
its
light
company
was
almost
cut
off
at
the
commencement
of
the
day
the
captain
was
taken
prisoner
being
the
only
british
officer
captured
that
day
with
six
men
and
there
were
over
other
casualties
stopford
s

lost
two

lord
blantyre
s

masséna
still
had
it
in
his
power
to
attack
again
for
mermet
s
division
of
the
corps
and
the
whole
of
junot
s
infantry
had
not
yet
advanced
and
had
hardly
lost
a
man
but
the
result
of
ney
s
and
reynier
s
efforts
had
been
so
disheartening
that
the
marshal
refused
to
waste
more
lives
on
what
was
clearly
a
hopeless
enterprise
he
could
now
see
wellington
s
army
concentrated
on
the
two
points
that
had
been
attacked
hill
s
heavy
column
of
men
had
now
lined
the
heights
on
leith
s
right
cole
had
edged
the
division
close
in
to
craufurd
s
left
and
coleman
and
the
germans
were
visible
in
the
rear
if
masséna
had
still
fresh
infantry
the
english
general
had
who
had
not
yet
come
up
into
the
it
was
useless
to
persist
accordingly
the
skirmishing
along
ney
s
front
was
allowed
to
die
down
in
the
afternoon
and
the
french
divisions
retired
to
their
camps
the
total
loss
of
wellington
s
army
had
been
officers
and
men
of
whom
were
killed
wounded
and
missing
no
officer
over
the
rank
of
a
major
had
been
killed
and
the
only
senior
officers
wounded
were
the
portuguese
brigadier
champlemond
and
colonel
barclay
of
the
of
the
casualties
were
in
the
ranks
of
the
british
in
those
of
the
portuguese
regiments
a
strange
coincidence
in
the
losses
of
the
two
allied
armies
the
portuguese
line
indeed
had
done
their
fair
half
of
the
fighting
as
the
return
showed
in
no
instance
with
discredit
in
some
with
high
merit
if
the
and
portuguese
had
broken
before
foy
s
attack
it
was
under
severe
stress
and
when
attacked
by
superior
numbers
on
the
other
hand
pack
s
brigade
coleman
s
and
the
caçadores
of
the
light
division
won
the
highest
praises
from
their
commanders
and
had
taken
a
most
distinguished
part
in
the
victory
wellington
now
knew
exactly
how
far
they
could
be
trusted
and
could
estimate
at
last
the
real
fighting
value
of
his
army
at
least
for
a
defensive
battle
in
chosen
and
favourable
ground
it
would
be
another
matter
to
calculate
how
far
the
allied
host
was
capable
of
taking
the
offensive
the
total
loss
of
the
french
as
shown
by
the
return
which
was
not
quite
complete
presented
to
masséna
on
october
was
of
whom
were
killed
wounded
and
missing
prisoners
after
his
usual
fashion
he
represented
it
to
the
emperor
as
being
about
one
general
graindorge
two
colonels
and
other
officers
had
been
killed
four
generals
maucune
foy
merle
simon
were
wounded
the
last
was
also
a
prisoner
five
colonels
and
other
officers
were
wounded
the
corps
in
all
had
lost
at
least
officers
and
men
the
corps
at
least
it
may
be
remembered
that
of
all
the
battles
in
the
peninsular
war
this
was
the
one
in
which
the
proportion
of
officers
to
men
hit
on
the
french
side
was
highest
one
to
sixteen
the
average
being
one
to
in
ordinary
engagements
the
excessive
proportion
of
casualties
in
the
commissioned
ranks
bears
witness
to
a
desperate
attempt
to
lead
on
the
men
to
an
impossible
task
in
which
the
officers
sacrificed
themselves
in
the
most
splendid
style
this
too
in
a
dispatch
to
berthier
dated
coimbra
three
days
after
the
returns
had
been
placed
before
him
for
these
returns
see
appendix
no
xiii
they
are
certainly
incomplete
omitting
losses
of
the
cavalry
of
the
corps
where
martinien
s
invaluable
tables
show
that
three
officers
were
wounded
losses
of
the
corps
which
caught
a
few
shells
as
it
stood
on
the
heights
by
moura
and
had
as
again
shown
by
martinien
s
tables
six
officers
hit
which
must
imply
some
hundred
men
some
casualties
in
the
infantry
omitted
in
the
returns
for
while
the
report
accounts
for
killed
and
wounded
officers
martinien
names
deducting
the
cavalry
and
corps
losses
mentioned
above
there
are
still
fifteen
officers
and
therefore
presumably
men
too
few
given
in
the
reports
sent
in
to
masséna
for
the
léger
the
report
has
eighteen
officers
hit
martinien
gives
the
names
of
masséna
must
not
be
too
much
blamed
for
his
experiment
he
had
still
to
ascertain
the
fighting
value
of
wellington
s
army
and
estimated
it
too
low
because
of
the
extreme
prudence
which
his
adversary
had
hitherto
displayed
he
was
handicapped
by
the
impossibility
of
using
his
artillery
effectively
and
the
position
in
front
of
him
was
strong
even
stronger
than
he
guessed
because
of
the
road
of
communication
along
the
rear
of
the
plateau
but
not
too
strong
to
be
forced
if
the
defenders
did
not
fight
well
moreover
it
was
immensely
long
nine
miles
from
end
to
end
so
that
two
blows
delivered
with
a
corps
each
in
the
centre
might
have
pierced
the
line
before
the
enemy
s
distant
reserves
could
get
up
favoured
by
the
fog
as
we
have
seen
reynier
actually
won
the
heights
for
a
moment
though
ney
never
got
near
the
crest
the
mistake
lay
not
so
much
in
making
the
trial
as
in
the
warlike
efficiency
of
the
enemy
strokes
like
wallace
s
charge
with
the
and
or
craufurd
s
masterly
advance
with
the
and
are
beyond
the
common
experiences
of

masséna

were
repulsed
by

that
was
the
number
of

engaged

could
not
have
been
foreseen
but
the
lesson
was
learnt
before
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
a
fortnight
later
masséna
refused
to
take
any
more
risks
of
the
kind
and
the
campaign
assumed
a
very
different
character
because

additional
points
require
notice
the

a
feature
which
no

properly
express
and
which
no
one
who
has
not
gone
very
carefully
over
the
hillside
can
fully
picture
to
himself
it
produces
an
absolute
want
of
continuity
between
the
two

not

far
as

on

other
the
whole
of

far
as
the

but
in
each
direction
there
is
so
much
wood
and

that
many
roads
and

are
masked
the
french
army
both
in

was
only
intermittently
visible
but
enough
could
be
made
out
to
determine
its
general
movements
with
fair
precision

detail

traveller
will
find
a
little
museum
including
a
very
fine
topographical
map
with
the
position
of
the
allied
troops
and
more
especially
of
the
portuguese
regiments
well
marked
there
are
a
few
errors
in
the
placing
of
the
british
battalions
but
nothing
of
consequence
the
french
army
is
only
vaguely
indicated
but
the
map
is
a
credit
to
the
portuguese
engineer
officers
who
compiled
it
as
i
have
observed
in
the
next
chapter
the
ground
to
the
north
along
the
serras
de
alcoba
and
de
caramula
is
not
so
uniformly
lofty
or
so
forbidding
in
its
aspect
as
to
cause
the
observer
to
doubt
whether
there
can
be
any
pass
across
the
watershed
in
that
direction
indeed
the
first
idea
that
strikes
the
mind
on
reaching
the
summit
of
the
serra
and
casting
a
glance
round
the
wide
landscape
is
that
it
is
surprising
that
any
officer
in
the
french
army
can
have
believed
that
the
caramula
was
absolutely
impracticable
moreover
it
is
far
less
easily
defensible
than
the
bussaco
ridge
because
it
is
much
more
broken
and
full
of
cover
the
beauty
of
the
bussaco
position
is
that
save
on
the
spurs
it
is
entirely
bare
of
cover
on
the
side
facing
eastward
the
smooth
steep
slope
with
its
furze
and
heather
and
its
occasional
outcrops
of
rock
makes
a
splendid
glacis
the
reverse
space
would
be
a
far
worse
position
to
defend
against
an
enemy
coming
from
coimbra
and
the
because
it
is
thickly
interspersed
with
woods
with
the
possible
exception
of
some
of
the
pyrenean

the
most
beautiful

view

mountain
and
distant

from
the
summit
of
the

is
unique
in
its
beauty
it
is
small
wonder
that
the
modern
portuguese
have
turned
it

that

note
on
the
crisis
of
the
battle
of
bussaco
while
there
is
no
point
of
dispute
concerning
that
part
of
the
battle
of
bussaco
in
which
craufurd
pack
and
coleman
were
engaged
against
the
corps
there
was
bitter
controversy
on
the
exact
details
of
the
repulse
of
reynier
s
corps
by
picton
and
leith
picton
and
following
him
his
subordinates
of
the
division
thought
that
leith
s
part
in
the
action
was
insignificant
that
he
merely
repulsed
a
minor
attack
after
the
main
struggle
was
over
leith
and
his
officers
considered
that
they
gave
the
decisive
blow
that
picton
s
line
would
have
been
broken
and
the
battle
perhaps
lost
if
barnes
s
brigade
had
not
arrived
at
the
critical
moment
and
saved
the
situation
all
that
picton
would
allow
was
that
leith
aided
the
wing
of
the
and
the
portuguese
in
repulsing
the
enemy
s
last
grattan
who
wrote
an
admirable
narrative
of
the
defeat
of
merle
s
division
by
the
and
the
neighbouring
troops
denied
that
the
division
was
ever
pressed
says
that
he
never
saw
leith
s
men
till
the
action
was
over
and
points
out
that
barnes
s
brigade
out
of
bayonets
lost
but
men
altogether
while
the
regiment
alone
lost
thrice
and
the
more
than
twice
as
many
killed
and
wounded
out
of
their
scanty
numbers
and
out
of
and
respectively
other
division
officers
suggest
see
the
letters
in
the
appendix
to
napier
s
sixth
volume
that
leith
fought
only
with
a
belated
body
of
french
skirmishers
or
with
men
who
had
been
cut
off
from
the
main
attacking
column
by
the
successful
advance
of
wallace
on
the
other
hand
leith
see
his
letter
in
wellington
vol
vi
speaks
of
coming
on
the
ground
to
find
a
large
french
column
crossing
the
serra
and
the
portuguese
and
broken
and
about
to
recoil
down
the
rear
slope

and

the
bear

out
napier
has
failed
to
make
the
situation
clear
from
not
seeing
that
there
were
two
completely
separate
attacks
of
the
french
divided
by
an
appreciable
interval
he
thinks
that
foy
was
on
the
serra
as
soon
as
merle
and
calls
his
column
iii
the
french
battalions

had
first
gained
the
crest
while
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
had
only
started
after
wallace
s
repulse
of
merle
was
long
over
the
real
situation
is
made
clear
when
reynier
s
and
heudelet
s
dispatches
in
the
french
archives
and
foy
s
diary
are
studied
from
these
it
is
clear
that
there
were
occasions
on
which
the
french
got
to
the
top
of
the
serra
the
first
during
merle
s
attack
the
second
during
foy
s
i
have
quoted
foy
s
narrative
on
above
but
it
may
be
well
to
give
also
his
note
showing
the
of
his
column

it
was
only
at
this
instant
when
the
fugitives
from
merle
s
attack
were
pouring
past
him
that
he
got
his
orders
from
reynier
to
attack
and
started
to
climb
the
slope
there
must
therefore
have
been
an
interval
of
more
than
half
an
hour
possibly
of
an
hour
between
the
moment
when
wallace
thrust
merle
off
the
plateau
and
that
at
which
foy
crowned
it
only
to
be
attacked
and
beaten
by
the
newly
arrived
leith
for
it
took
a
very
long
time
for
the
french
and
to
climb
the
slope
and
they
only
reached
the
top
with
difficulty
the
skirmishers
of
the
and
portuguese
and
of
meade
s
wing
of
the
having
fought
hard
to
keep
them
back
reynier
s
dispatch
is
equally
clear
as
to
his
corps
having
made
two
separate
attacks
he
adds
that
some
of
sarrut
s
men
were
rallied
in
time
to
support
foy
a
statement
for
which
i
find
no
corroboration
elsewhere
napier
then
has
failed
to
grasp
the
situation
when
he
makes
the
french
crown
the
crest
above
the

lines
of

vedras
october
the
dawn
of
september
brought
small
comfort
to
masséna
his
desperate
attacks
of
the
preceding
day
had
been
repulsed
with
such
ease
and
such
heavy
loss
that
neither
he
nor
any
of
his
subordinates
dreamed
of
renewing
the
attempt
to
force
the
line
of
the
serra
only
three
courses
were
open
to
him
to
retreat
on
almeida
giving
up
the
campaign
as
one
too
ambitious
for
the
strength
of
his
army
or
to
change
his
objective
and
strike
backwards
at
oporto
if
lisbon
were
beyond
his
grasp
or
to
endeavour
to
move
wellington
out
of
his
position
by
turning
his
flank
since
a
frontal
attack
had
proved
disastrous
the
first
course
was
advocated
by
more
than
one
adviser
but
presented
no
attractions
to
the
marshal
he
was
both
obstinate
and
angry
and
did
not
dream
for
a
moment
of
spoiling
his
military
reputation
by
retreating
tamely
after
a
lost
battle
the
blow
at
oporto
was
equally
unattractive
he
had
been
told
to
drive
the
english
out
of
portugal
and
to
capture
lisbon
not
to
make
a
mere
lodgement
on
the
douro
moreover
as
he
had
remarked
to
ney
before
the
battle
if
he
marched
on
oporto
by
the
bad
road
via
vizeu
he
might
find
the
british
army
once
more
in
his
front
when
he
drew
nearer
to
the
city
since
the
is
both
shorter
and
better
than
the
which
he
would
have
to
follow
there
remained
the
third
possibility
that
of
turning
wellington
out
of
the
bussaco
position
by
flanking
operations
the
did
not
look
very
promising
but
the
attempt
must
be
made
early
on
the
the
french
cavalry
was
sent
out
in
both
directions
to
explore
the
whole
neighbourhood
a
task
which
masséna
should
have
prescribed
to
it
on
the
and
instead
of
keeping
it
massed
in
his
rear
the
reconnaissances
sent
southward
by
reynier
s
light
cavalry
brought
no
encouraging
report
if
the
french
army
crossed
the
mondego
it
would
only
run
against
wellington
s
carefully
prepared
position
behind
the
alva
fane
s
cavalry
were
out
in
this
direction
and
would
give
ample
time
of
warning
to
allow
the
allied
army
to
pass
the
fords
of
peña
cova
and
man
the
long
series
of
earthworks
only
a
repetition
of
the
bussaco
disaster
could
follow
from
an
attempt
to
take
the
offensive
on
this
side
from
the
north
however
montbrun
who
had
ridden
out
with
some
of
s
dragoons
brought
far
more
cheering
news
this
indeed
was
the
flank
where
on
the
first
principles
of
topography
some
hope
of
success
might
have
been
looked
for
to
any
one
standing
either
on
the
bussaco
heights
or
on
the
lower
ridge
in
front
of
them
and
casting
an
eye
over
the
dappled
and
uneven
to
the
north
it
seems
incredible
that
there
should
be
no
route
whatever
across
the
serra
de
caramula
both
the
of
beira
and
the
valley
of
the
oerins
the
little
river
which
drains
the
plain
of
mortagoa
were
thickly
populated
was
it
likely
that
there
would
be
no
means
of
getting
from
the
one
to
the
other
save
by
the
through
bussaco
or
the
circuitous
road
far
to
the
north
from
vizeu
to
aveiro
via
feramena
and
bemfeita
the
maps
it
is
true
showed
no
other
route
but
every
day
that
he
remained
in
portugal
was
proving
more
clearly
to
the
marshal
that
his
maps
lopez
and
the
rest
were
hopelessly
inaccurate
the
serra
de
caramula
though
rugged
is
not
one
continuous
line
of
precipices
nor
is
it
of
any
great
altitude
on
first
principles
it
was
probable
that
there
might
be
one
or
more
passages
in
this
stretch
of
thirty
miles
though
it
was
conceivable
that
there
might
be
no
road
over
which
artillery
could
travel
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
modern
railway
from
coimbra
and
pampilhosa
to
the
upper
mondego
does
not
use
the
pass
of
bussaco
but
goes
north
of
it
round
the
left
flank
of
wellington
s
position
by
luso
far
south
of
the
boialvo
road
to
mortagoa
there
was
therefore
nothing
astonishing
in
the
fact
that
montbrun
discovered
that
such
a
track
existed
nine
miles
north
of
bussaco
running
from
mortagoa
by
aveleira
and
boialvo
to
sardão
in
the
valley
of
the
agueda
one
of
the
affluents
of
the
vouga
there
was
nothing
particularly
startling
in
the
discovery
nor
did
it
imply
any
special
perspicacity
in
the
discoverers
as
many
of
the
french
narratives
seek
to
imply
a
peasant
captured
in
one
of
the
deserted
villages
high
up
the
oerins
and
by
masséna
s
portuguese
mascarenhas
who
accompanied
on
his
reconnaissance
revealed
the
fact
that
this
existed
he
even
it
is
said
expressed
to
his
compatriot
his
surprise
that
the
french
had
not
taken
it
when
first
they
arrived
at
mortagoa
since
it
was
unguarded
while
the
whole
allied
army
was
lying
across
the
bussaco
it
was
he
said
habitually
used
by
the
of
the
peasantry
it
was
not
a
good
road
but
was
a
perfectly
practicable
one
with
this
news
montbrun
and
returned
to
masséna
about
midday
the
marshal
at
once
resolved
to
make
an
attempt
to
utilize
the
boialvo
road
there
was
some
danger
in
doing
so
since
it
was
possible
that
wellington
might
wait
till
the
greater
part
of
the
french
army
had
retired
from
his
front
and
then
descend
upon
the
rearguard
and
overwhelm
it
or
on
the
other
hand
he
might
have
made
preparations
to
hold
the
further
end
of
the
pass
so
that
when
the
vanguard
of
the
invaders
was
nearing
boialvo
or
sardão
they
might
find
men
withdrawn
from
the
bussaco
position
in
haste
lying
across
their
path
at
some
dangerous
turn
of
the
road
indeed
we
may
confidently
assert
that
if
in
the
british
general
had
possessed
the
army
that
he
owned
in
masséna
would
have
had
the
same
unpleasant
experience
that
befell
soult
at
sorauren
when
he
attempted
a
precisely
similar
manœuvre
a
flank
march
round
the
allied
army
on
the
day
after
a
lost
battle
but
masséna
was
prepared
to
take
risks
and
the
risk
which
he
was
now
accepting
was
a
considerably
less
perilous
one
than
that
which
he
had
incurred
when
he
chose
to
make
a
frontal
attack
on
the
bussaco
position
on
the
preceding
day
for
though
flank
marches
across
an
enemy
s
front
are
justly
deprecated
by
every
military
authority
this
was
one
executed
at
a
distance
of
nine
or
ten
miles
from
the
british
line
and
not
in
a
level
country
on
to
which
wellington
might
easily
descend
from
his
fastness
but
in
a
broken
wooded
upland
full
of
ridges
on
which
the
french
might
have
formed
up
to
fight
if
assailed
if
this
fact
did
not
remove
the
danger
it
at
any
rate
made
it
infinitely
less
if
one
of
the
two
possible
contretemps
should
happen
if
wellington
should
come
down
with
a
sudden
rush
upon
the
rearguard
that
force
would
have
to
fight
a
defensive
action
on
the
ridges
below
bussaco
till
the
main
body
could
turn
back
to
help
it
in
that
case
there
would
follow
a
pitched
battle
upon
rolling
and
uneven
ground
which
did
not
favour
one
side
more
than
the
other
and
this
at
any
rate
would
be
a
more
favourable
situation
for
the
french
than
that
in
which
they
had
fought
on
if
on
the
other
hand
wellington
should
send
a
strong
detachment
to
hold
the
western
debouch
of
the
boialvo
road
nothing
would
be
lost
if
nothing
would
be
gained
it
was
improbable
that
there
would
be
any
position
in
that
quarter
quite
so
strong
as
the
tremendous
slope
of
the
serra
de
bussaco
the
result
of
an
attempt
to
force
the
defile
might
be
successful
at
any
rate
masséna
thought
the
experiment
worthy
of
a
trial
accordingly
on
the
afternoon
of
the
ostentatious
demonstrations
were
made
against
the
front
of
the
bussaco
position
which
led
to
a
good
deal
of
objectless
skirmishing
wellington
was
not
for
a
moment
deceived
indeed
the
idea
that
another
assault
was
impending
was
negatived
by
the
fact
that
both
reynier
s
and
ney
s
men
were
seen
to
be
throwing
up
and
digging
trenches
on
the
flanks
of
the
two
roads
on
which
they
lay
these
could
only
be
meant
for
defensive
use
and
presumably
must
be
intended
to
help
the
french
rearguard
to
hold
the
ridges
if
the
army
should
descend
upon
them
late
in
the
afternoon
officers
furnished
with
good
telescopes
and
stationed
on
the
highest
point
of
the
bussaco
serra
reported
that
they
could
detect
columns
in
movement
from
the
french
rear
in
the
direction
of
the
these
were
s
cavalry
and
the
of
ney
and
junot
making
their
way
to
the
rear
in
order
to
get
into
the
road
at
six
o
clock
dusk
having
still
not
come
on
it
was
reported
that
ney
s
infantry
reserves
were
certainly
moving
in
the
same
direction
only
loison
s
division
was
still
immovable
on
its
old
position
opposite
sula
at
nightfall
therefore
the
movement
of
the
french
was
well
ascertained
it
might
mean
merely
a
general
retreat
on
mortagoa
and
an
abandonment
of
the
campaign
but
this
was
most
unlikely
far
more
probable
was
some
march
to
turn
the
allied
flank
by
the
passes
of
the
serra
de
caramula
wellington
himself
had
no
doubt
whatever
that
this
was
the
enemy
s
intention
as
the
dusk
fell
he
stood
for
some
time
on
the
summit
of
the
serra
watching
the
french
columns
receding
in
the
distance
he
then
rode
back
to
his
head
quarters
at
the
convent
of
bussaco
and
dictated
without
delay
a
series
of
orders
which
set
his
whole
army
in
retreat
for
coimbra
and
lisbon
before
daylight
the
position
was
deserted
only
a
rearguard
being
left
on
it
he
does
not
seem
to
have
thought
for
a
moment
of
attacking
on
the
following
morning
the
corps
and
loison
s
division
which
had
been
left
in
his
front
nor
of
directing
his
right
wing
to
march
on
sardão
which
it
could
have
reached
long
before
the
french
arrived
there
each
of
these
courses
was
so
obvious
that
critics
have
lavished
blame
upon
him
for
not
adopting
the
one
or
the
other
the
firing
commenced
soon
after
noon
see
tomkinson
this
was
imagined
to
be
the
case
by
some
observers
who
overrated
masséna
s
loss
and
thought
he
had
casualties
on
the
see
for
example
fririon
pp
toreno
ii
thiers
and
even
napier
iii
the
explanation
of
his
conduct
is
neither
that
he
failed
to
see
the
two
alternatives
which
were
in
his
power
nor
that
he
showed
as
several
french
writers
maintain
an
excessive
timidity
still
less
is
it
possible
to
urge
as
some
have
done
that
he
was
ruined
by
his
own
neglect
to
occupy
the
boialvo
road
he
knew
of
that
pass
had
taken
it
into
consideration
and
in
one
of
his
dispatches
speaks
vaguely
of
a
means
which
he
was
hoping
to
discover
to
render
it
useless
to
the
enemy
this
remedy
can
not
mean
as
some
have
supposed
the
moving
thither
of
trant
s
corps
of
portuguese
militia
it
is
true
that
wellington
had
ordered
this
force
to
occupy
sardão
some
days
before
but
it
was
neither
large
enough
nor
composed
of
troops
solid
enough
to
resist
even
in
a
strong
position
the
attack
of
a
single
french
brigade
some
other
device
must
have
been
meant
though
we
can
not
determine
what
it
may
have
been
the
true
key
to
wellington
s
action
is
to
remember
the
immense
pains
that
he
had
taken
in
building
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
and
the
elaborate
arrangements
that
had
been
made
during
the
last
few
weeks
to
complete
the
system
for
devastating
portugal
in
front
of
the
enemy
it
was
by
these
means
and
not
by
fights
in
the
open
that
he
had
from
the
first
designed
to
defeat
the
invader
bussaco
had
been
an
uncovenanted
mercy
if
masséna
chose
to
run
his
head
against
that
stone
wall
it
was
worth
while
to
man
it
and
to
permit
him
to
break
himself
against
its
granite
boulders
but
such
an
operation
as
descending
into
the
plain
to
attack
the
corps
on
the
or
offering
battle
in
front
of
sardão
on
that
same
day
was
not
within
the
scope
of
wellington
s
intentions
if
he
had
wished
to
engage
in
that
sort
of
fighting
he
had
already
had
ample
opportunities
to
attack
sections
of
the
french
army
during
the
last
two
months
but
to
get
engaged
with
one
corps
in
a
rolling
upland
and
then
to
have
the
other
two
converging
on
him
while
the
fight
was
in
progress
he
had
never
intended
nor
would
he
do
so
now
he
gave
his
orders
for
the
retreat
of
the
army
on
coimbra
actually
before
the
french
had
possession
of
their
own
end
of
the
boialvo
pass
and
at
a
moment
when
a
single
night
march
would
have
sufficed
to
place
cole
craufurd
and
spencer
across
the
western
end
of
it
with
ample
time
to
choose
a
position
before
the
enemy
could
arrive
in
front
he
explains
his
refusal
to
do
so
in
his
memorandum
of
operations
in
in
the
following
terms
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
detach
a
corps
from
the
army
to
occupy
the
serra
de
caramula
after
the
action
of
the
that
corps
might
have
been
hard
pressed
and
obliged
to
retreat
in
which
case
it
must
have
retreated
upon
sardão
and
the
north
of
portugal
it
could
not
have
rejoined
the
army
and
its
services
would
have
been
wanting
in
the
fortified
position
in
front
of
lisbon
it
was
therefore
determined
to
rely
upon
colonel
trant
alone
to
occupy
the
serra
de
caramula
as
his
line
of
operations
and
retreat
was
to
the
northward
nothing
could
have
been
done
except
by
detaching
a
large
corps
to
prevent
the
french
from
throwing
a
large
force
across
the
caramula
when
therefore
they
took
that
road
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
withdraw
from
bussaco
and
after
quitting
bussaco
there
was
no
position
that
we
could
take
up
with
advantage
in
which
we
could
be
certain
that
we
could
prevent
the
enemy
from
getting
to
lisbon
before
us
till
we
reached
the
fortified
positions
in
front
of
that
place
as
to
the
other
possibility
that
of
attacking
the
french
rearguard
below
bussaco
instead
of
endeavouring
to
stop
its
vanguard
at
sardão
wellington
only
observes
that
they
had
at
least
or
more
men
than
we
had
and
good
as
our
position
was
theirs
was
equally
if
he
had
fallen
upon
reynier
the
latter
he
thought
could
have
detained
him
long
enough
to
allow
ney
and
junot
to
return
and
so
he
would
have
found
himself
committed
to
an
offensive
action
against
superior
numbers
on
unfavourable
ground
vi
had
he
proposed
to
blast
away
sections
so
as
to
make
it
impassable
for
wheel
traffic
as
he
did
with
the
estrada
nova
vii
pp
these
arguments
are
unanswerable
when
we
consider
wellington
s
position
he
have
succeeded
in
checking
masséna
at
boialvo
or
sardão
but
if
he
did
not
ruin
would
ensue
since
he
might
be
cut
off
from
the
detached

then
would
not
have
men
enough
to
hold
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
he
have
crushed
reynier
before
he
was
succoured
but
if
he
failed
to
do
so
and
became
involved
in
a
general
action
a
disastrous
defeat
was
possible
in
short
considering
what
failure
would
mean
the
loss
of
lisbon
the
of
the
army
probably
the
end
of
the
peninsular
war
he
rightly
hesitated
to
take
any
risk
whatever
at
the
same
time
we
may
suspect
that
if
the
allied
army
of
had
been
the
army
of
wellington
might
very
possibly
have
played
a
more
enterprising
game
but
the
portuguese
still
formed
the
larger
half
of
his
force
and
though
he
had
ascertained
by
their
behaviour
on
the
that
they
were
now
capable
of
fighting
steadily
in
a
defensive
action
on
favourable
ground
it
was
nevertheless
very
doubtful
whether
he
could
dare
to
risk
them
in
a
battle
fought
under
different
conditions
one
cheering
example
of
the
courage
and
discipline
of
these
newly
organized
regiments
did
not
justify
him
in
taking
it
for
granted
that
they
could
be
trusted
under
all
possible
conditions
as
if
they
were
veteran
british
troops
on
the
dawn
of
therefore
the
two
armies
were
marching
away
from
each
other
on
the
bussaco
position
there
remained
only
craufurd
s
light
division
strengthened
by
anson
s
cavalry
brigade
which
was
brought
up
behind
the
serra
to
form
the
mounted
section
of
the
force
which
was
for
the
next
ten
days
to
act
as
the
rearguard
of
the
allied
army
opposite
them
only
reynier
remained
and
he
had
drawn
far
back
on
to
the
mortagoa
road
where
he
stood
in
a
defensive
position
in
the
morning
but
retired
brigade
after
brigade
in
the
afternoon
the
main
body
of
wellington
s
army
was
retiring
in
two
columns
hill
and
hamilton
s
portuguese
division
crossed
the
fords
of
peña
cova
and
marched
for
espinhal

had
been
left
far
out
on

right
behind
the
alva
fane

and
lecor
s
portuguese
militia
joined

and
accompanied
him
to
lisbon
this
column
was
absolutely
unmolested
by
the
enemy
during
the
whole
twelve
days
of
the
retreat
to
the
lines
the
french
did
not
so
much
as
follow
it
with
a
cavalry
patrol
the
other
and
larger
column
formed
of
spencer
cole
leith
and
picton
with
pack
s
coleman
s
and
alex
campbell
s
portuguese
marched
for
mealhada
and
coimbra
craufurd
and
anson
started
twelve
hours
later
to
bring
up
the
rear
during
the
hours
while
the
light
division
was
waiting
its
orders
to
start
some
of
its
officers
explored
the
evacuated
french
position
and
found
parked
in
an
enclosure
desperately
wounded
soldiers
whom
masséna
had
abandoned
to
the
mercy
of
the
portuguese
peasantry
he
had
used
up
all
available
carts
and
mules
to
carry
his
wounded
but
had
been
forced
to
leave
the
worst
cases
behind
they
were
picked
up
and
moved
into
the
convent
of
bussaco
on
what
became
of
them
afterwards
it
is
well
not
to
speculate
no
friendly
column
came
that
way
again
and
the
ordenança
were
daily
growing
more
exasperated
at
the
conduct
of
the
invading
army
the
french
were
not
only
carrying
out
in
an
intermittent
fashion
masséna
s
edict
of
directing
that
all
men
with
arms
but
without
uniforms
were
to
be
shot
at
sight
but
burning
every
village
that
they
passed
and
murdering
nearly
every
peasant
that
they
could
hunt
down
whether
he
was
bearing
arms
or
no
see
tomkinson
and
von
linsingen
s
diary
in
beamish
i
fririon
and
the
other
french
narratives
speak
of
the
difficulties
of
transporting
the
wounded
but
do
not
mention
that
any
were
abandoned
unless
some
of
reynier
s
rearguard
cavalry
may
have
looked
in
at
bussaco
on
the
when
craufurd
had
gone
this
is
possible
trant

back
in

then
came
the

out
in

at

the

watched
by

were
directed
to
hold
back
its
exploring

and
not
to
permit
it
to
reach
coimbra
an
hour
sooner
than
could
be

there
was
also
a
clash
on

only
arrived
there
on

of

not
by
his
own
fault
but
because
his
superior
officer
baccelar
commanding
the
whole

of

north
had
ordered
him
to
move
from
lamego
to
sardão
by
the
circuitous

along

douro
and
then
from

southward
instead
of
taking
the
straight

he
might
possibly
have
been
stopped
by

outlying

these
from

from

strong

bolted
at

pushed
in

began
to
make

retreat
towards

at
that
place
early
on

were
joined
by

at

ten
miles
behind
the
others
the
biscuit
which
the
french
army
had
taken
with
it
from
almeida
was
now
almost
exhausted
and
it
was
a
great
relief
to
the
troops
to
find
in
the
deserted
villages
of
the
plain
of
coimbra
considerable
quantities
of
maize
and
rice
with
which
they
could
eke
out
or
replace
the
carefully
hoarded
rations
i
can
not
resist
quoting
here
trant
s
account
of
the
engagement
he
was
a
man
of
quaint
humour
and
the
all
too
few
letters
from
him
to
general
wilson
which
have
come
into
my
hands
by
the
courtesy
of
wilson
s
representative
captain
bertram
chambers
inspire
me
with
regret
that
i
have
not
his
whole
correspondence
i
have
once
more
been
putting
my
fellows
to
a
trial
my
caçadore
battalion
did
not
do
as
it
ought
and
had
about
thirty
killed
wounded
and
prisoners
without
making
scarcely
any
resistance
a
pleasant
business
on
the
i
was
still
at
agueda
sardão
and
agueda
are
one
village
properly
speaking
but
divided
by
a
bridge
though
i
was
aware
that
the
french
principal
force
of
cavalry
was
at
boyalva
only
a
league
from
agueda
and
i
was
completely
cut
off
from
the
army
on
that
morning
i
had
withdrawn
the
infantry
to
the
vouga
but
placed
my
dragoons
close
to
agueda
to
observe
the
french
with
the
caçadores
at
a
distance
to
support
them
i
put
them
in
the
most
advantageous
possible
position
protected
by
a
close
pine
wood
through
which
the
french
cavalry
must
pass
i
had
been
from
three
in
the
morning
till
one
o
clock
making
my
arrangements
and
had
just
sat
down
to
eat
something
in
a
small
village
on
the
left
of
the
vouga
when
a
dragoon
came
flying
to
inform
me
that
the
french
were
coming
on
with
two
columns
of
cavalry
in
full
speed
my
coffee
was
not
ready
and
remained
for
the
french
to
amuse
themselves
with
i
had
only
time
to
get
the
penafiel
regiment
over
the
bridge
when
the
french
arrived
five
minutes
sooner
and
i
had
been
nabbed
i
drew
up
in
a
good
position
but
the
french
did
not
cross
the
vouga
and
i
returned
to
oliveira
without
molestation
but
not
without
a
damned
false
alarm
and
panic
on
the
part
of
the
dragoons
who
were
covering
my
rear
they
galloped
through
the
infantry
and
carried
confusion
and
all
the
comforts
of
hell
to
oporto
bravoure
bombasto
who
commanded
the
caçadores
ordered
his
men
to
fire
but
thought
that
enough
for
his
honour
as
he
instantly
left
them
to
shift
for
themselves
and
never
looked
behind
till
he
reached
oporto
i
put
this
fellow
with
four
of
the
leading
dragoons
into
the
common
dungeon
of
this
place
and
am
about
to
inflict
some
divisional
punishment
for
i
daren
t
report
such
conduct
to
the
marshal
beresford
who
does
not
punish
by
halves
my
regiments
of
infantry
this
is
the
brighter
side
of
the
picture
showed
no
agitation
notwithstanding
the
attack
on
their
nerves
the
enemy
s
force
i
now
ascertain
was
cavalry
two
pieces
and
two
infantry
regiments
the
cavalry
alone
would
have
done
my
business
if
they
had
crossed
the
vouga
but
they
contented
themselves
with
driving
in
the
dragoons
and
the
caçadore
battalion
from
agueda
god
bless
you
meanwhile
the
city
of
coimbra
was
full
of
distressing
scenes
though
wellington
had
ordered
the
whole
population
of
western
beira
to
leave
their
abodes
as
soon
as
the
french
reached
vizeu
yet
only
the
richest
of
the
inhabitants
of
coimbra
had
departed
the
bulk
had
still
held
to
their
houses
and
the
news
of
the
victory
of
bussaco
had
encouraged
them
to
hope
that
no
evacuation
would
be
necessary
the
portuguese
government
though
it
had
consented
to
carry
out
wellington
s
scheme
of
devastation
and
had
duly
published
proclamations
commanding
its
execution
had
taken
no
great
pains
to
secure
obedience
to
it
the
sacrifice
indeed
that
was
demanded
of
the
citizens
of
a
wealthy
town
such
as
coimbra
was
a
very
great
one
far
more
bitter
than
that
imposed
on
the
peasantry
who
were
told
at
the
same
moment
to
evacuate
their
flimsy
cottages
it
was
bitterly
resented
and
despite
of
the
proclamation
of
the
inhabitants
of
coimbra
were
still
in
their
houses
when
on
the
night
of
the
arrived
wellington
s
dispatch
stating
that
he
was
abandoning
bussaco
that
the
french
would
be
in
the
city
by
the
or
on
the
of
october
and
that
force
would
be
used
if
necessary
to
expel
people
who
still
clung
to
their
dwellings
during
the
next
two
days
the
whole
of
the
population
of
coimbra
was
streaming
out
of
the
place
by
the
roads
to
the
south
or
dropping
down
the
mondego
in
boats
to
ship
themselves
for
lisbon
at
the
little
port
of
figueira
even
on
the
of
october
the
day
when
the
french
were
reputed
to
be
facing
fornos
only
eight
miles
away
all
had
not
yet
departed
many
of
the
poor
the
infirm
and
the
reckless
remained
behind
to
the
last
possible
moment
and
only
started
when
the
distant
cannonade
on
the
northern
side
showed
that
the
british
outposts
were
being
driven
in
twenty
miles
of
road
were
covered
by
the
dense
column
of
fugitives
headed
by
those
who
had
started
on
the
and
brought
up
behind
by
those
who
had
waited
till
the
last
moment
there
was
a
great
want
of
wheeled
conveyances
the
richer
folks
had
gone
off
with
most
of
them
and
others
had
been
requisitioned
for
the
allied
wounded
hence
many
could
take
off
nothing
but
what
they
could
carry
on
their
persons
an
writes
that
he
saw
the
whole
covered
with
respectable
families
walking
on
foot
with
bundles
on
their
heads
while
in
the
abandoned
houses
he
noticed
food
of
all
sorts
shirts
and
all
manner
of
other
property
which
was
left
behind
in
disorder
because
it
was
too
heavy
to
be
carried
another
tells
how
the
old
and
the
infirm
no
less
than
the
young
and
robust
carrying
with
them
all
their
more
valuable
effects
covered
the
fields
as
well
as
the
road
in
every
direction
and
from
time
to
time
the
weary
fugitives
unable
to
carry
further
the
heavier
articles
that
they
had
endeavoured
to
save
dropped
them
by
the
wayside
and
struggled
onward
bereft
of
the
remnant
of
their
little
property
fortunately
the
weather
for
the
first
eight
days
after
the
evacuation
of
coimbra
was
warm
and
dry
so
that
the
unhappy
multitude
had
almost
reached

of
some
danger
if
they
had
been
closely
followed
by
french
infantry
and
forced
to
turn
back
to

themselves
but
nothing
more
than
a
troop
of
dragoons
watched
their
passage
of
the
bridge
and
their
retreat
to
condeixa
and
not
a

had
to
be
fired
it

eager
pursuers

at

than

were

the
entry
of
an
army
into
a
deserted
town
is
always
accompanied
by
disorders
that
of
the
army
of
masséna
into
coimbra
was
an
exaggerated
example
of
the
rule
and
for
good
reasons
the
men
had
been
living
on
bare
rations
for
a
month
and
suddenly
they
found
themselves
in
a
town
of
souls
where
every
door
was
open
every
larder
garnished
and
every
cellar
full
the
very
quays
were
littered
with
sacks
of
flour
torn
open
and
puncheons
of
rum
stove
in
for
wellington
s
commissariat
officers
had
been
to
the
last
moment
engaged
in
breaking
up
and
casting
into
the
river
the
remains
of
the
magazine
which
had
been
feeding
the
army
at
bussaco
the
houses
on
every
side
were
full
of
valuable
goods
for
most
of
the
inhabitants
had
only
been
able
to
carry
off
their
money
and
plate
and
had
left
all
else
behind
them
the
first
division
of
the
corps
the
earliest
french
troops
to
enter
the
place
consisted
almost
entirely
of
fourth
battalions
composed
of
conscripts
and
ill
disciplined
they
broke
their
ranks
and
fell
to
plunder
only
by
their
officers
many
of
whom
joined
in
the
sport
a
late
comer
from
the
artillery
says
that
he
saw
one
officer
breaking
open
a
door
with
a
pickaxe
and
another
placing
a
sentry
at
the
door
of
a
shop
which
he
wished
to
reserve
for
his
own
personal
pillage
there
was
drunkenness
some
arson
and
an
enormous
amount
of
mischievous
and
wanton
waste
it
was
afterwards
said
that
junot
s
corps
destroyed
in
twelve
hours
an
amount
of
food
that
would
have
sufficed
to
supply
the
whole
army
for
three
weeks
it
is
at
any
rate
certain
that
coimbra
was
full
of
provisions
when
the
french
arrived
and
that
when
order
was
tardily
restored
only
a
few
days
consumption
could
be
scraped
together
to
fill
the
empty
waggons
before
the
host
marched
on
masséna
raged
against
junot
for
not
having
kept
his
men
in
hand
yet
if
portuguese
narratives
are
to
be
trusted
he
set
as
bad
an
example
as
any
disorderly
conscript
since
he
requisitioned
for
himself
out
of
the
university
buildings
all
the
telescopes
and
mathematical
instruments
and
distributed
them
among
his
staff
the
pillage
was
as
wanton
and
objectless
as
it
was
thorough
the
tombs
of
the
kings
in
the
church
of
santa
cruz
were
broken
open
the
university
museum
and
laboratories
wrecked
and
all
the
churches
wantonly
damaged
and
desecrated
there
was
no
attempt
to
restore
order
or
to
utilize
the
captured
property
for
the
general
good
of
the
army
till
the
corps
marched
in
on
the
next
day
even
these
later
comers
however
could
not
be
restrained
from
joining
in
the
plunder

of

they

pp
the
authority
for
this
statement
is
the
portuguese
renegade
general
pamplona
who
served
on
the

s
staff

of
his
sur

adds
that
ney
refused
to
take
the
present
of
a
large
telescope
which
masséna
sent
him
as
a
propitiatory
gift
a
less
certain
authority
says
that
the
marshal
caught
in
the
street
a
plunderer
with
a
barrel
of
butter
and
another
with
a
chest
of
wax
candles

let
them
off

iii
the
state
of
his
army
on
the
and
october
sufficiently
explains
the
conduct
of
masséna
in
refraining
from
the
pursuit
of
wellington
s
rearguard
but
he
was
also
somewhat
puzzled
to
determine
the
policy
which
he
must
now
adopt
down
to
the
last
moment
he
had
thought
that
wellington
would
have
fought
at
fornos
or
some
other
such
position
to
defend
coimbra
and
even
when
coimbra
was
evacuated
he
had
imagined
that
he
might
find
the
enemy
drawn
up
to
dispute
the
passage
of
the
mondego
but
it
was
now
clear
that
wellington
was
in
full
retreat
for
lisbon
since
the
marshal
was
still
ignorant
of
the
existence
of
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
which
was
only
revealed
to
him
four
days
later
he
was
somewhat
uncertain
how
to
interpret
the
conduct
of
his
adversary
after
the
vigorous
stand
that
wellington
had
made
at
bussaco
it
seemed
dangerous
to
argue
that
he
must
now
be
in
headlong
flight
for
his
ships
and
about
to
evacuate
portugal
yet
the
rapidity
of
his
retreat
seemed
to
argue
some
such
purpose
ought
he
therefore
to
be
pursued
without
a
moment
s
delay
in
order
that
his
embarkation
might
be
made
difficult
this
course
it
is
said
was
advocated
by
reynier
montbrun
fririon
and
the
portuguese
renegade
d
alorna
on
the
other
hand
ney
and
junot
both
advised
a
stay
at
coimbra
to
rest
the
army
collect
provisions
and
what
was
most
important
of
all
to
reopen
communications
with
almeida
ciudad
rodrigo
and
the
corps
which
was
now
due
on
the
spanish
frontier
they
pointed
to
the
diminished
strength
of
the
army
which
having
lost
men
at
bussaco
and
more
by
the
hard
marching
and
poor
feeding
of
the
last
month
was
now
reduced
to
some
men
the
of
wellington
was
formidable
as
he
had
shown
at
bussaco
where
many
of
the
french
officers
persisted
in
believing
that
he
had
shown
numbers
superior
to
their
own
in
which
they
erred
a
hasty
advance
it
was
urged
might
bring
the
invaders
in
face
of
a
second
bussaco
where
there
was
no
chance
of
a
turning
movement
would
the
wish
to
accept
another
battle
of
the
same
sort
it
would
be
better
to
establish
a
new
base
at
coimbra
to
bring
up
the
corps
from
the
rear
and
only
to
move
on
when
the
army
was
thoroughly
reorganized
meanwhile
a
detachment
might
demonstrate
against
oporto
to
distract
wellington
s
attention
this
was
the
policy
that
napoleon
two
months
after
declared
that
masséna
should
have
adopted
why
he
asked
did
the
prince
of
essling
after
his
failure
at
bussaco
pursue
the
march
on
lisbon
instead
of
taking
up
a
position
on
the
mondego
and
restoring
his
communications
with
almeida
i
had
not
burdened
him
with
orders
or
instructions
and
he
could
see
that
the
english
were
not
easy
to
masséna
s
advocate
foy
replied
that
if
the
army
of
portugal
had
been
halted
on
the
mondego
your
majesty
would
have
said
to
the
prince
why
did
you
not
march
on
the
english
would
have
if
they
had
been
to
which
napoleon
with
a
broad
smile
answered
very
true
i
probably
should
have
said
so
fririon
in
his
account
of
these
debates
pp
forgets
that
the
existence
of
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
was
still
unknown
both
to
masséna
and
his
subordinates
so
does
delagrave
pp
but
pelet
masséna
s
confidant
is
positive
that
they
were
first
heard
of
from
prisoners
taken
at
pombal
on
two
days
after
the
advance
had
recommenced
foy
s
minutes
of
his
conversation
with
the
emperor
on
sent
by
him
to
masséna
in
his
letter

foy
s
by
girod
de
l
ain
the
problem
presented
to
the
marshal
indeed
was
not
an
easy
one
if
he
remained
at
coimbra
his
enemies
would
delate
him
to
the
emperor
for
timidity
if
he
advanced
he
might
find
that
he
had
undertaken
a
task
too
great
for
his
strength
the
personal
equation
settled
the
difficulty
masséna
was
obstinate
and
enterprising
to
the
verge
of
temerity
he
resolved
to
go
on
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
in
the
hope
of
forcing
wellington
to
a
battle
on
ground
less
favourable
than
bussaco
or
of
compelling
him
to
embark
without
any
general
engagement
at
all
two
days
only
were
spent
at
coimbra
on
october
montbrun
s
cavalry
after
making
a
reconnaissance
as
far
as
the

and
the
port
of
figueira
crossed
the

to
villa
nova
de
ancos
while
the
corps
headed
by

occupied

one
division
of
ney
s
corps
followed
them
the
rest
of
the
corps
and
reynier
made
ready
to
resume
their
advance
a
minor
problem
remained
to
be
resolved
should
a
large
garrison
be
left
in
coimbra
and
a
new
base
for
the
army
established
there
the
marshal
had
shot
into
the
convent
of
santa
clara
bussaco
wounded
and
sick
men
there
was
an
accumulation
of
waggons
of
the
and
the
grand
park
which
could
push
on
no
further
for
want
of
draught
beasts
and
all
manner
of
other
impedimenta
if
the
army
went
on
at
full
speed
in
the
hope
of
overtaking
the
english
all
this
must
be
left
behind
but
if
left
unguarded
wounded
and
all
might
become
the
victims
of
trant
s
militia
which
was
known
to
have
retired
no
further
than
the
vouga
or
even
of
the
ordenança
of
the
hills
a
strong
garrison
must
be
placed
in
coimbra
to
make
it
safe
rumour
had
it
on
october
that
taupin
s
brigade
and
a
regiment
of
dragoons
were
to
be
set
to
guard
the
city
but
rumour
was
wrong
masséna
after
some
doubting
made
up
his
mind
that
he
could
not
spare
even
men
every
bayonet
would
be
wanted
if
wellington
once
more
turned
to
bay
accordingly
he
took
the
extraordinary
step
of
telling
off
only
a
single
company
men
of
the
de
la
a
naval
unit
which
had
been
given
him
in
order
that
he
might
have
a
nucleus
of
people
in
case
he
succeeded
in
seizing
the
portuguese
arsenal
at
lisbon
one
would
have
thought
that
such
men
would
have
been
so
valuable
if
only
the
enterprise
had
succeeded
that
he
would
have
chosen
rather
a
company
of
ordinary
infantry
these
sailors
with
two
or
three
hundred
footsore
or
convalescent
men
organized
into
a
couple
of
provisional
companies
were
all
that
the
marshal
placed
at
the
disposition
of
major
flandrin
to
whom
he
gave
the
title
of
governor
of
coimbra
that
officer
was
told
that
every
day
would
increase
his
force
as
more
convalescents
came
out
of
hospital
and
muskets
belonging
to
the
sick
and
wounded
were
left
with
him
the
whole
mass
of
disabled
men
was
concentrated
in
the
convent
of
santa
clara
a
vast
building
outside
the
suburb
of
coimbra
on
the
south
side
of
the
mondego
the
garrison
was
so
weak
that
it
could
do
no
more
than
keep
a
guard
at
each
of
the
exits
of
the
town
which
was
destitute
of
walls
with
a
post
of
thirty
men
all
that
could
be
spared
at
fornos
on
the
great
north
road
facing
oporto
to
abandon
his
wounded
to
almost
certain
destruction
was
a
reckless
act
on
the
marshal
s
part
probably
he
said
to
himself
that
if
he
could
but
catch
and
beat
the
army
a
small
disaster
in
his
rear
would
be
forgiven
him
unlike
wellington
he
was
taking
risks
so
guingret
of
the
corps
who
mentions
that
his
own
regiment
received
notice
that
no
garrison
was
to
be
left
only
just
in
time
to
enable
it
to
pick
up
its
slightly
wounded
and
footsore
men
who
would
otherwise
have
remained
behind
p
the
best
summing
up
of
the
marshal
s
resolve
may
be
found
in

this
combat
would
not
have
been
worth
mentioning
but
for
the
fact
that
it
was
from
prisoners
captured
in
it
that
masséna
got
his
first
news
of
the
existence
of
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
some
of
the
troopers
spoke
freely
of
the
lines
as
their
point
of
destination
not
guessing
that
this
was
the
first
time
that
their
captors
had
heard
of
them
hence
the
french
generals
learned
that
there
were
now
fortifications
in
front
of
lisbon
but
they
had
of
course
no
knowledge
of
their
extent
or
character
and
only
expected
to
find
some
on
which
wellington
would
turn
to
bay
in
fact
masséna
was
encouraged
by
the
news
thinking
that
he
was
now
certain
of
the
battle
which
he
desired
on
the
october
the
french
infantry
was
all
concentrated
at
leiria
reynier
s
corps
having
now
rejoined
the
other
two
montbrun
s
cavalry
spread
out
so
far
as
alcobaça
whose
monastery
it
sacked
on
the
and
muliano
on
the
central
road
vedettes
were
sent
out
on
the
to
thomar
also
but
could
find
no
trace
of
an
enemy
in
that
direction
on
the
night
that
followed
masséna
received
the
disquieting
intelligence
that
his
deliberate
taking
of
risks
with
regard
to
coimbra
had
already
been
punished
a
mounted
officer
who
had
escaped
brought
him
news
that
his
hospitals
and
their
guard
had
been
captured
at
a
single
blow
by
trant
s
militia
that
same
afternoon
that
enterprising
partisan
it
will
be
remembered
had
been
driven
behind
the
vouga
by
s
dragoons
on
september
since
however
none
of
the
french
turned
aside
to
molest
him
and
all
marched
across
his
front
on
the
coimbra
road
he
was
not
forced
to
retire
any
further
and
having
his
orders
from
wellington
to
follow
the
enemy
with
caution
and
pick
up
his
stragglers
and
marauders
he
came
southward
again
when
masséna
s
rearguard
entered
coimbra
he
had
advanced
to
mealhada
when
it
was
reported
to
him
on
the
that
the
rearguard
of
the
french
had
left
the
city
on
the
preceding
day
a
few
people
who
had
returned
from
the
mountains
to
their
homes
despite
wellington
s
proclamation
sent
him
assurances
that
the
numbers
of
the
garrison
were
absolutely
insignificant
and
that
of
the
wounded
enormous
judging
rightly
that
it
would
have
a
splendid
moral
effect
to
capture
masséna
s
hospitals
and
the
commencement
of
a
which
was
being
formed
at
coimbra
trant
resolved
to
strike
at
once
if
he
had
waited
a
little
he
could
have
got
help
from
wilson
and
from
miller
who
had
descended
into
the
country
each
with
his
brigade
they
had
been
directed
by
wellington
to
cut
the
french
communications
with
almeida
and
had
already
carried
out
their
orders
but
trant
dreaded
delay
thinking
that
masséna
might
send
back
troops
to
coimbra
when
he
found
that
wellington
was
retiring
as
far
as
lisbon
without
waiting
for
his
colleagues
he
marched
at
midday
from
mealhada
to
fornos
on
the
and
had
the
good
fortune
to
surprise
and
capture
the
insignificant
french
post
at
that
village
not
a
man
escaped
he
was
now
only
eight
miles
from
coimbra
and
was
able
to
rush
down
into
the
city
in
the
early
afternoon
before
his
arrival
was
known
he
had
with
him
one
weak
squadron
of
regular
dragoons
and
six
militia
battalions
having
been
joined
since
september
by
all
his
stragglers
and
some
outlying
units
the
whole
made
about
men
formed
in
two
columns
they
charged
into
coimbra
by
its
two
northern
entrances
sweeping
away
the
small
french
guards
at
the
gates
the
squadron
of
cavalry
then
galloped
along
the
street
parallel
with
the
river
and
seized
the
bridge
thus
cutting
off
the
communication
between
the
french
in
the
town
and
those
at
the
convent
of
santa
clara
where
the
wounded
lay
the

the
enemy
kept
inside
the
place
took
refuge
in
the
bishop

palace
but
was
forced
to
lay
down
its
arms
at
the
end
of
an
hour
the
men
at
the
convent
joined
by
many
of
the
convalescents
kept
up
a
fire
for
a
short
time
but
surrendered
at
discretion
on
trant
s
promise
to
protect
them
from
the
fury
of
his
troops
he
was
unfortunately
not
entirely
able
to
redeem
his
promise
the
coimbra
local
regiment
was
so
enraged
at
the
state
in
which
it
found
its
native
town
that
it
mishandled
some
of
the
prisoners
eight

said
to

to

for
it

reported

behind

themselves

believing

to
be
still
far
away

despising

in

taupin

infantry
came
up
and
engaged
the
pickets
of
the
light
division
in
a
skirmish
having
been
strictly
forbidden
by
wellington
to
get
entangled
in
a
rearguard
action
and
remembering
perhaps
his
experience
at
the
coa
craufurd
tardily
and
unwillingly
moved
off
but
dusk
coming
on
his
column
missed
its
road
and
instead
of
retiring
into
the
section
of
the
lines
which
it
was
destined
to
occupy
between
the
monte
agraça
and
the
valley
of
calandriz
went
too
far
to
the
west
and
came
in
upon
the
position
of
the
division
in
front
of
sobral
this
would
have
been
dangerous
if
the
french
had
had
any
infantry
to
the
front
to
take
advantage
of
the
unoccupied
gap
in
the
lines
but
montbrun
s
advanced
guard
had
pressed
more
than
thirty
miles
in
front
of
the
main
body
of
masséna
s
army
and
this
force
contained
nothing
but
cavalry
save
the
single
brigade
of
taupin
less
than
men
this
force
such
as
it
was
did
not
pass
alemquer
that
night
craufurd
in
his
retreat
on
sobral
was
followed
by
cavalry
alone
it
was
not
till
next
morning
when
montbrun
sent
out
reconnaissances
in
all
directions
that
he
found
himself
in
front
of
fortifications
drawn
across
every
road
and
gradually
realized
that
he
was
in
front
of
the
famous
lines
of
torres
for
this
reason
the
dismal
picture
of
the
situation
drawn
by
napier
iii
must
be
considered
exaggerated
the
french
main
army
was
further
off
than
he
imagines
it
had
not
passed
alcoentre
the
cavalry
could
have
done
nothing
against
the
heights
and
taupin
s
brigade
would
have
been
crushed
if
it
had
endeavoured
to
enter
the
gap
but
it
never
came
within
ten
miles
of
the
exposed
point
on
the
and
not
having
passed
alemquer
the
light
division
diarists
do
not
treat
seriously
the
position
which
napier
paints
in
such
gloomy
colours
see
leach
and
simmons
the
light
division
countermarched
from
sobral
to
arruda
and
reached
their
proper
post
long
before
midnight
there
they
picked
up
a
detachment
of
convalescents
and
recruits
from
lisbon
who
had
been
waiting
for
them
among
these
were
harry
smith
and
simmons
who
have
accounts
of
the
arrival
of
the
division
after
dark
and
of
its
relief
at
finding
large
fires
already
lighted
and
provisions
prepared
by
the
draft
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
wellington
s
final
arrangements
for
the
reception
of
the
army
of
masséna
in
front
of
lisbon
were
made
at
leisure
or
at
a
moment
when
he
had
nothing
to
distract
him
though
the
actual
retreat
of
his
army
from
the
position
of
bussaco
to
the
position
of
torres
vedras
was
conducted
at
an
easy
pace
and
practically
unmolested
by
the
enemy
yet
the
days
during
which
it
was
being
carried
out
were
a
time
of
political
though
not
of
military
storm
and
stress
ever
since
the
french
had
started
from
almeida
and
made
their
first
advance
into
the
mountains
of
beira
wellington
had
been
engaged
in
an
endless
and
tiresome
controversy
with
the
portuguese
regency
though
they
had
assented
long
before
to
the
scheme
for
devastating
the
and
bringing
masséna
to
a
check
only
in
front
of
lisbon
yet
when
the
actual
invasion
began
and
the
first
hordes
of
fugitives
were
reported
to
be
leaving
their
homes
and
burning
their
crops
and
taking
to
the
mountains
several
of
the
members
of
the
regency
became
appalled
at
the
awful
sacrifices
which
they
were
calling
upon

endure

himself
at
the

was

famous

before
the
regency
proposals
that
wellington
should
be
formally
requested
to
try
the
chances
of
a
pitched
battle
on
the
frontier
before
retiring
on
coimbra
or
lisbon
in
addition
he
was
always
maintaining
in
private
company
that
the
people
should
not
be
required
to
take
in
hand
the
scheme
of
devastation
and
wholesale
emigration
till
it
was
certain

was
unable

east
of

he
also
laid
before
the
regency
documents
intended
to
prove
that
the
system
of
devastation
was
physically
impossible
and
that
it
would
prove
incapable
of
stopping
the
advance
of
the
french
owing
to
the
difficulty
that
would
be
found
in
persuading
the
peasantry
to
destroy
instead
of
hiding
their
stores
of
food
there
was
a
certain
modicum
of
truth
in
this
last
argument
and
the
french
did
succeed
in
living
for
a
longer
time
in
the
evacuated
districts
than
wellington
had
considered
possible
on
the
other
hand
the
principal
was
hopelessly
wrong
in
his
contention
that
the
french
would
suffer
little
inconvenience
they
were
starved
out
of
portugal
by
wellington
s
device
even
though
it
took
longer
to
work
out
its
results
than
he
had
calculated
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
sousa
was
in
any
way
treacherously
inclined
he
and
his
whole
family
stood
or
fell
with
the
english
alliance
and
the
victory
of
the
french
would
mean
ruin
to
them
but
his
private
and
public
utterances
and
those
of
his
satellites
had
a
deplorable
effect
in
the
mouth
of
the
common
people
it
took
the
form
of
a
rumour
that
wellington
had
refused
to
fight
at
all
and
intended
to
the
british
army
this
did
not
lead
to
any
wish
to
submit
to
napoleon
but
to
a
desperate
determination
to
resist
even
if
deserted
wellington
s
dispatches
are
full
of
a
riot
which
took
place
in
lisbon
on
september
when
the
militia
proposed
to
seize
on
julian
s
the
citadel
and
the
bugio
fort
because
they
were
informed
that
the
english
garrisons
were
about
to
evacuate
them
and
put
to
sea
when
masséna
had
already
passed
coimbra
sousa
was
mad
enough
to
propose
at
the
regency
board
that
the
portuguese
troops
should
not
retire
within
the
lines
but
remain
outside
and
offer
battle
in
the
open
even
if
the
british
refused
to
stand
by
them
the
nervous
activity
of
the
government
had
been
shown
some
three
weeks
before
by
the
sudden
arrest
and
deportation
of
some
fifty
persons
in
lisbon
who
were
suspected
rightly
or
wrongly
of
jacobinism
and
had
been
accused
of
having
secret
communication
with
d
alorna
and
the
other
renegades
in
masséna
s
army
they
included
a
few
officers
and
a
good
many
lawyers
doctors
merchants
and
minor
officials
as
well
as
some
dependants
and
relatives
of
the
exiles
the
case
against
most
of
them
was
so
weak
that
wellington
protested
against
their
banishment
holding
that
the
alarm
caused
by
the
arrests
would
make
the
people
of
lisbon
unreasonably
suspicious
and
give
rise
to
a
belief
in
plots
but
despite
his
letter
to
the
regency
all
were
shipped
off
to
the
azores
some
were
ultimately
allowed
to
go
to
england
others
to

were

tried
to
the
uttermost
by
these
distractions
when
his
mind
was
entirely
engrossed
by
military
problems
grew
sharp
and
irritable
at
this
time
he
went
so
far
as
to
write
to
the
prince
regent
at
rio
de
janeiro
to
declare
that
either
he
or
principal
sousa
must
leave

suggested

who
troubled
him
so
the
patriarch
as
a
necessary
evil
he
did
not
wish
to
displace
but
only
to
scare
unfortunately
an
appeal
to
brazil
was
hopeless
since
the
regent
was
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
principal
s
brother
the
conde
de
linhares
much
acrimonious
correspondence
delayed
by
the
vast
time
which
was
consumed
in
getting
letters
to
and
from
rio
only
led
in
the
end
to
a
proposal
from
linhares
that
his
brother
should
leave
the
regency
if
charles
stuart
the
british
ambassador
was
also
withdrawn
from
it
and
if
the
general
miguel
forjaz
whom
wellington
considered
a
necessary
person
and
the
ablest
man
in
portugal
should
also
be
removed
from
his
post
to
this
proposal
neither
wellington
nor
the
british
government
would
consent
and
as
it
only
came
in
when
masséna
s
invasion
had
already
been
foiled
and
the
french
had
retired
into
spain
the
crisis
was
over

talk
much
impracticable
and
mischievous
stuff

we
have
hitherto
when
speaking
of
wellington
s
immense
scheme
for
fortifying
the
position
on
which
he
intended
to
bring
his
enemy
to
a
standstill
refrained
from
entering
into
the
details
of
his
plan
it
is
now
time
to
describe
it
in
full
and
to
explain
its
design
the
character
of
the
peninsula
on
which
lisbon
stands
lends
itself
sufficiently
well
to
defence
at
a
first
inspection
the
offers
a
rather
chaotic
expanse
of
mountain
and
valley
whose
general
features
are
hard
to
seize
from
any
one
point
on
further
examination
it
appears
that
the
whole
square
mass
of
land
between
the
atlantic
and
the
tagus
estuary
is
nothing
more
than
a
continuation
of
the
ridge
of
the
serra
de
monte
junta
the
main
of
estremadura
but
from
the
backbone
or
central
mass
of
the
highland
so
many
large
spurs
are
thrown
out
to
each
side
and
these
are
themselves
so
high
and
steep
that
the
whole
peninsula
seems
more
like
a
ganglion
of
mountains
than
a
chain
the
two
chief
joints
or
vertebrae
in
the
backbone
are
the
monte
agraça
above
sobral
and
the
cabeça
de
montechique
six
miles
south
of
it
and
these
form
the
central
points
respectively
of
the
first
and
second
lines
of
defence
which
were
finally
laid
out
besides
the
outer
defences
there
was
in
wellington
s
scheme
from
the
very
start
an
inner
ring
of
works
covering
only
a
small
area
on
the
at
the
southernmost
point
of
the
peninsula
to
the
west
of
lisbon
this
was
merely
intended
to
cover
an
embarkation
if
by
any
unforeseen
disaster
the
lines
themselves
should
be
pierced
it
remains
to
speak
of
the
system
of
defences
in
detail
in
october
wellington
s
plan
had
embraced
no
more
than
one
continuous
line
of
works
from
alhandra
on
the
tagus
to
the
mouth
of
the
rio
são
lourenço
on
the
atlantic
with
certain
redoubts
and
fortified
camps
thrown
out
in
front
at
torres
vedras
monte
agraça
and
other
points
these
latter
fortifications
were
not
intended
to
be
held
in
permanence
but
it
was
hoped
that
they
might
defer
and
hinder
the
enemy
s
attack
on
the
main
line
in
the
rear
it
was
only
the
long
delay
in
masséna
s
advance
which
gave
wellington
five
or
six
months
on
which
he
had
not
counted
that
led
to
the
ultimate
strengthening
of
the
scattered
outer
works
and
their
conversion
into
a
continuous
whole
capable
of
turning
back
instead
of
merely
detaining
for
a
time
the
invading
army
indeed
all
across
the
peninsula
designs
that
were
slight
isolated
and
provisional
when
first
drawn
up
were
in
the
end
enlarged
and
perfected
into
wholly
different
structures
for
the
engineers
having
unlimited
labour
at
their
disposal
and
much
more
time
than
had
been
promised
them
could
turn
their
attention
after
the
essential
works
had
been
completed
to
devising
all
manner
of
additional
improvements
and
securities
for
the
chosen
position
the
construction
of
the
lines
was
entrusted
to
colonel
fletcher
wellington
s
commanding
engineer
who
had
as
his
chief
assistant
major
john
jones
the
historian
of
the
works
and
in
addition
eleven
british
officers
of
the
royal
engineers
two
from
the
king
s
german
legion
and
three
from
the
portuguese
regular
army
wellington
himself
after
making
one
survey
positions
in
fletcher
s
company
in
october
and
another
in
february
left
all
the
rest
to
his
subordinate
and
refrained
from
worrying
him
with
matters
of
detail
being
satisfied
that
his
own
intentions
had
been
thoroughly
well
grasped
the
labour
available
was
firstly
that
of
the
lisbon
militia
regiments
who
were
brought
up
by
alternate
pairs
and
paid
an
extra
a
day
for
their
services
secondly
that
of
hired
volunteers
from
the
peasantry
of
the
district
of
whom
from
to
were
generally
in
hand
they
received
afterwards
a
day
and
lastly
of
a
conscription
from
the
whole
of
southern
estremadura
for
a
circuit
of
forty
miles
around
the
forced
labour
was
paid
at
the
same
rate
as
that
freely
hired
on
the
whole
only
about
was
paid
out
between
november
and
september
so
that
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
may
be
considered
one
of
the
cheapest
investments
in
history
the
militiamen
and
peasantry
were
worked
in
gangs
of
some
or
men
each
in
charge
of
an
engineer
officer
who
had
a
few
english
and
portuguese
military
artificers
as
his
assistants
only
such
were
available
so
short
were
both
armies
of
trained
men
in
some
districts
a
subaltern
officer
of
engineers
with
a
few
english
soldiers
utterly
ignorant
of
the
language
directed
and
controlled
the
labour
of
peasantry
many
of
them
compelled
to
work
at
a
distance
of
forty
miles
from
their
homes
while
their
lands
lay
neglected
nevertheless
during
a
year
of
this
forced
labour
not
a
single
instance
of
insubordination
or
riot
occurred
the
great
quantity
of
work
performed
should
in
justice
to
the
portuguese
be
ascribed
more
to
the
regular
habit
of
persevering
labour
in
those
employed
than
to
the
efficiency
of
the
control
exercised
over
them
indeed
it
is
but
a
tribute
of
justice
to
the
portuguese
of
estremadura
to
state
that
during
many
months
of
constant
personal
intercourse
both
private
and
public
the
labouring
classes
ever
showed
themselves
respectful
industrious
docile
and
obedient
while
the
governing
classes
in
every
public
transaction
evinced
much
intelligence
patriotism
good
sense
and
probity
secrecy
with
respect
to
the
extent
and
nature
of
the
works
was
enjoined
and
it
is
highly
creditable
to
all
concerned
that
hardly
a
vague
paragraph
concerning
the
lines
found
its
way
into
the
public
prints
the
french
invaders
remained
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
the
barrier
rising
against
them
till
they
found
our
army
arrayed
on
it
so
as
to
stop
their
further
advance

in

therefore
miles
of
defences
were
planned
a
stupendous
work
far
exceeding
when
its
elaborate
details
are
studied
anything
that
had
been
constructed
in
modern
times
in
the
way
of
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
character
of
the
lines
in
no
way
resembles
that
of
our
own
great
roman
wall
from
tyne
to
solway
of
the
wall
of
china
or
of
any
other
long
continuous
stretch
of
masonry
it
is
only
on
a
few
points
that
works
of
any
great
length
are
to
be
found
the
lines
are
in
essence
a
series
of
closed
earthworks
dotted
along
the
commanding
points
of
the
two
ranges
of
hills
which
wellington
chose
as
his
first
and
second
fronts
of
resistance
some
few
of
the
earthworks
rose
to
the
dignity
of
fortified
camps
armed
with
many
scores
of
guns
the
majority
of
them
were
small
redoubts
constructed
to
hold
three
to
six
guns
and
garrisons
of
two
or
three
hundred
men
only
but
even
the
smallest
of
them
were
individually
formidable
from
their
structure
the
normal
ditch
was
feet
wide
and
feet
deep
the
parapets
to
feet
thick
and
all
were
properly
fitted
with
banquettes
when
it
is
remembered
that
they
were
well
palisaded
and
had
outer
hindrances
of
abattis
de
and
scattered
in
front
it
is
clear
that
they
were
forts
requiring
a
regular
attack
not
mere
lines
of
trench
and
mound
the
strength
of
the
whole
series
was
that
they
were
placed
in
scientific
fashion
so
as
to
cross
fires
over
all
the
ground
on
which
an
attacking
force
was
likely
to
present
itself
no
practicable
point
of
assault
could
be
found
on
which
advancing
columns
would
not
be
cut
up
by
flanking
fire
for
a
very
long
distance

they
drew
near

up

as
to
give

ascent

the
line

to

credit

may
be
incidentally

paid
on
a
liberal
scale
to
all
owners

made
by

banks
and
in
a
short
time
more
than
half
the
valley
has
become
so
complete
a
bog
that
no
reward
can
induce
any
of
the
peasantry
to
pass
over
it
wrote
the
officer
who
had
carried
out
the
experiment
nor
was
it
possible
for
the
enemy
to
attempt
to
drain
the
bog
for
four
redoubts
furnished
with
heavy
guns
and
placed
on
dominating
points
of
the
hillside
commanded
the
bottom
so
completely
that
it
was
impossible
for
any
party
to
approach
it
with
safety
yet
the
redoubts
were
out
of
the
range
of
on
the
slopes
beyond
the
zizandre
only
guns
of
position
could
have
touched
them
and
masséna
had
none
such
with
him
two
similar
inundations
on
a
smaller
scale
had
been
caused
at
the
other
end
of
the
lines
by
damming
up
the
alhandra
and
alverca
streams
each
of
which
spread
out
in
a
marsh
a
mile
broad
reaching
to
the
foot
of
the
heights
above
the
tagus
and
could
only
be
passed
on
the
narrow
paved
from
santarem
to
lisbon
jones
afterwards
when
masséna
had
arrived
increased
to
sixteen
redoubts
with
guns
see
jones
in
other
places
a
very
different
method
of
making
the
lines
unapproachable
had
been
adopted
where
the
heights
were
very
steep
but
not
absolutely
inaccessible
a
dangerous
thing
to
the
defence
for
here
dead
ground
unsearchable
by
the
cannon
of
the
redoubts
above
must
almost
necessarily
occur
the
slope
had
been
cut
or
blasted
away
in
bands
so
as
to
make
absolute
precipices
on
a
small
scale
at
one
point
above
alhandra
this
was
done
on
a
front
of
full
yards
even
this
was
not
the
last
precaution
taken
at
several
places
ravines
ran
deep
into
the
line
and
up
them
columns
more
or
less
under
cover
might
possibly
have
penetrated
such
ravines
therefore
were
stuffed
at
chosen
points
by
a
broad
abattis
or
entanglement
mainly
composed
of
with
all
their
chief
boughs
remaining
dragged
together
and
interlaced
for
a
depth
of
many
yards
such
a
structure
could
not
be
crawled
through
nor
could
it
be
hewn
down
without
an
infinite
waste
of
time
and
labour
nor
on
the
other
hand
did
it
afford
any
cover
since
grape
or
musketry
could
play
perfectly
well
through
it
the
chief
of
these
traps
was
that
laid
across
the
long
ravine
above
the
village
of
arruda
down
the
bottom
of
which
flows
one
of
the
winter
torrents
which
fall
eastward
into
the
tagus
jones
an
extent
of
upwards
of
yards
on
the
left
has
been
so
cut
and
blasted
along
its
summit
as
to
give
a
continuous
scarp
everywhere
exceeding
feet
in
height
and
covered
for
its
whole
length
by
both
musketry
and
it
was
fortunate
that
portugal
was
a
country
there
are
regions
where
it
would
be
impossible
to
procure
the
immense
amount
of
timber
that
was
lavished
on
the
accessories
of
the
redoubts
all
as
has
been
already
mentioned
were
palisaded
many
had
in
addition
abattis
or
entanglements
thrown
up
in
front
of
them
some
way
down
the
hillside
so
as
to
detain
the
advancing
enemy
under
fire
as
long
as
possible
the
works
were
divided
into
eight
sections
the
first
line
composed
of
four
the
second
line
of
three
while
the
eighth
consisted
of
the
inner
retrenchment
for
purposes
of
embarkation
at
the
extreme
southern
point
of
the
peninsula
of
the
outer
or
secondary
line
the
three
sections
were
a
front
of
five
miles
from
the
tagus
at
alhandra
along
the
crest
of
a
steep
but
not
very
lofty
ridge
as
far
as
the
great
ravine
that
overlooks
the
village
of
arruda
this
front
was
elaborately
fortified
as
it
blocks
the
great
road
in
the
flat
by
the
waterside
which
forms
the
easiest
approach
to
lisbon
from
the
north
in
the
five
miles
there
were
ultimately
constructed
no
less
than
redoubts
with
guns
two
thousand
yards
of
hillside
in
one
place
had
been
scarped
into
a
precipice
a
mile
by
the
side
of
the
tagus
had
been
inundated
the
one
considerable
gap
in
the
line
the
ravine
at
the
head
of
the
valley
of
calandriz
had
been
choked
by
one
of
the
great
above
described
the
redoubts
required
a
garrison
of
men
the
second
section
from
the
ravine
above
arruda
to
the
left
of
the
steep
monte
agraça
formed
somewhat
of
a
salient
angle
it
had
a
front
in
all
of
some
four
and
a
half
miles
which
included
the
most
lofty
and
defensible
part
of
the
backbone
range
of
the
lisbon
peninsula
one
of
the
four
great
paved
roads
entering
the
capital
from
the
north
however
passes
over
the
shoulder
of
these
heights
and
they
were
therefore
very
heavily
fortified
from
the
first
the
large
redoubt
for
men
on
the
top
of
monte
agraça
being
one
of
the
original
outer
works
ordered
for
construction
in
wellington
s
earliest
notes
of
october
there
were
in
all
seven
redoubts
mounting
guns
and
requiring
a
garrison
of
men
on
this
fraction
of
the
lines
quite
different
in
character
was
the
front
of
eight
miles
from
the
left
of
monte
agraça
to
the
pass
of
runa
overlooking
the
upper
valley
of
the
zizandre
and
the
village
of
sobral
the
fortification
of
this
line
had
not
entered
into
wellington
s
original
plan
and
there
were
only
two
redoubts
upon
it
when
masséna
appeared
before
it
in
october
such
defence
as
there
was
consisted
in
the
fact
that
the
dominating
monte
agraça
redoubts
overlooked
it
on
the
right
and
that
the
two
small
works
just
mentioned
commanded
the
main
from
sobral
to
cabeça
de
montechique
which
goes
through
its
centre
but
there
was
a
clear
possibility
that
the
enemy
might
make
a
push
up
the
valley
and
the
by
the
village
of
zibreira
and
this
was
indeed
the
most
probable
point
of
attack
in
the
whole
miles
of
front
for
the
enemy
to
select
when
at
the
last
moment
the
british
determined
to
hold
the
outer
lines
and
not
merely
to
fall
back
after
having
used
them
for
a
temporary
defence
he
had
to
cram
this
point
with
troops
and
to
construct
new
works
upon
it
as
quickly
as
possible
four
divisions
therefore
more
than
men
were
concentrated
here
wellington
s
own
head
quarters
were
established
at
the
hamlet
of
pero
negro
on
the
slope
above
the
and
a
very
large
redoubt
was
thrown
up
on
the
portello
hill
above
zibreira
with
several
smaller
ones
further
to
the
right
to
connect
it
with
the
monte
agraça
works
sobral
the
village
at
the
foot
of
the
heights
was
held
as
an
outpost
but
abandoned
when
masséna
pushed
forward
to
the
front
as
it
was
too
far
advanced
to
the
north
to
be
treated
as
an
integral
part
of
the
position
but
the
french
when
they
had
carried
sobral
with
difficulty
looked
at
the
main
line
behind
it
and
refused
to
attempt
any
further
advance
the
hillside
was
as
formidable
as
the
bussaco
heights
from
which
they
had
only
recently
been
repulsed
it
was
full
of
troops
and
growing
in
strength
every
moment
as
the
earthworks
continued
to
arise
the
fourth
section
of
the
outer
or
northern
front
was
that
from
the
gorge
of
the
zizandre
or
the
pass
of
runa
as
it
is
sometimes
called
to
the
sea
it
was
about
twelve
miles
long
but
of
this
space
six
miles
and
more
was
covered
by
the
impassable
bog
formed
by
the
obstructed
zizandre
and
another
mile
was
formed
by
the
formidable
entrenched
camp
of
san
vincente
above
the
town
of
torres
vedras
the
most
complete
and
of
all
the
works
in
the
peninsula
this
stronghold
lay
outside
the
main
line
beyond
the
river
covering
the
bridge
and
the
paved
from
leiria
to
lisbon
the
only
on
the
western
side
of
the
lines
it
was
one
of
the
earliest
of
the
fortifications
commenced
by
wellington
s
engineers
having
been
started
on
november
and
was
placed
in
such
a
conspicuous
point
and
planned
on
such
a
large
scale
that
it
attracted
public
attention
more
than
any
other
part
of
the
works
and
gave
its
name
to
the
whole
in
popular
parlance
the
whole
front
on
both
sides
of
torres
vedras
and
its
great
fort
was
so
strong
and
inaccessible
as
to
offer
little
temptation
to
the
invader
to
select
it
as
a
point
of
serious
attack
all
the
more
so
because
troops
brought
opposite
to
it
would
be
completely
cut
off
from
any
left
in
front
of
the
eastern
and
central
part
of
the
lines
for
the
geography
of
the
peninsula
at
this
point
is
peculiar
north
of
the
gorge
of
the
zizandre
the
great
backbone
range
the
serra
de
barregudo
and
the
serra
de
monte
junta
extends
for
a
distance
of
fifteen
miles
without
being
crossed
by
a
single
road
practicable
for
horses
much
less
for
wheeled
vehicles
there
are
nothing
but
across
the
heights
if
therefore
any
considerable
body
of
troops
had
been
sent
to
observe
or
contain
the
western
section
of
the
lines
it
would
have
been
separated
by
two
days
march
from
the
rest
of
the
army
and
liable
to
be
crushed
ere
succoured
by
the
defenders
of
lisbon
who
had
good
across
the
peninsula
by
which
they
could
transfer
themselves
from
point
to
point
under
the
protection
of
their
works
as
a
matter
of
fact
nothing
but
flying
parties
of
french
horse
ever
appeared
in
this
direction
masséna
had
not
troops
to
spare
for
any
secondary
attack
more
especially
for
one
on
such
an
unpromising
part
of
the
lines
wellington
had
foreseen
this
when
he
distributed
his
field
army
behind
the
various
sections
of
the
front
to
support
the
garrisons
of
the
twelve
miles
of
redoubts
about
torres
vedras
he
only
placed
one
division
while
there
were
three
behind
the
eastern
section
and
more
than
four
in
the
partially
entrenched
central
part
by
an
astonishing
blunder
the
camp
of
torres
vedras
is
placed
by
napier
in
his
map
and
apparently
in
his
text
also
of
the
river
zizandre
on
the
main
line
of
heights
while
in
reality
it
was
a
great
covering
the
only
passage
from
north
to
south
over
the
stream
and
its
bogs
see
note
to
that
effect
in
jones
the
third
division
picton
only
behind
torres
vedras
behind
the
section
were
the
hill
hamilton
s
portuguese
and
the
light
division
in
the
central
part
the
divisions
and
three
unattached
portuguese
brigades
pack
coleman
and
al
campbell
passing
on
to
the
second
line
of
defence
from
quintella
on
the
tagus
to
the
mouth
of
the
rio
são
lourenço
on
the
atlantic
we
find
three
sections
of
defence
which
unlike
those
of
the
outer
line
were
all
completed
by
september
and
had
no
central
gap
there
was
over
a
mile
of
impassable
inundation
at
the
eastern
end
between
quintella
and
alverca
above
the
village
was
an
isolated
hill
which
was
all
fortress
for
no
less
than
six
redoubts
had
been
placed
upon
it
to
enfilade
the
across
the
inundated
lower
ground
then
came
the
serra
de
serves
three
miles
of
lofty
and
difficult
hills
which
had
been
scarped
into
almost
perfect
inaccessibility
in
a
sudden
dip
west
of
this
range
was
the
pass
of
bucellas
through
which
runs
one
of
the
three
great
that
enter
lisbon
it
was
easily
defensible
as
it
lies
between
two
high
and
steep
and
is
only
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
broad
redoubts
were
placed
so
as
to
rake
it
from
end
to
end
and
to
flank
it
on
both
sides
the
itself
was
blocked
with
successive
abattis
and
the
viaduct
leading
up
to
it
was
mined
the
second
section
of
the
inner
line
extended
from
the
pass
of
bucellas
to
the
park
of
mafra
a
front
of
over
six
miles
the
eastern
part
of
this
was
formed
by
the
towering
heights
of
the
cabeça
de
montechique
the
most
dominating
in
the
whole
peninsula
almost
steep
enough
to
defend
itself
without
fortification
but
three
redoubts
nevertheless
had
been
reared
upon
its
summit
but
from
the
pass
of
montechique
at
the
left
side
of
the
summit
down
to
mafra
the
ground
was
less
well
marked
and
here
the
from
sobral
and
zibreira
crossed
the
range
much
fortification
therefore
was
lavished
on
these
four
miles
along
which
there
were
nine
strong
redoubts
connected
with
each
other
in
the
rear
by
a
military
road
passing
along
the
southern
crest
of
the
heights
there
was
a
second
and
formidable
ridge
behind
this
line
where
further
defence
could
be
offered
in
the
unlikely
event
of
the
enemy
forcing
his
way
up
the
from
mafra
to
the
sea
nearly
ten
miles
there
was
for
the
most
part
a
line
of
heights
protected
in
front
by
the
ravine
of
the
river
of
são
lourenço
a
deep
rugged
and
in
many
cases
inaccessible
cleft
only
crossed
by
a
single
road
that
from
torres
vedras
to
mafra
nevertheless
six
redoubts
were
reared
to
cover
this
and
the
few
other
points
where
the
ravine
was
passable
the
eastern
part
of
this
section
that
along
the
wall
of
the
royal
park
tapada
of
mafra
was
its
weakest
portion
and
for
two
miles
at
this
point
the
british
engineers
set
all
their
ingenuity
to
work
the
outlying
heights
called
the
serra
de
chypre
in
front
of
the
park
were
covered
by
four
redoubts
and
turned
into
a
first
defence
the
wall
of
the
tapada
itself
was
loopholed
and
furnished
with
a
banquette
the
important
road
which
passes
its
foot
was
obstructed
with
cuts
enfiladed
by
the
artillery
of
several
works
and
stockaded
at
more
than
one
point
there
was
another
group
of
redoubts
along
the
south
end
of
the
torres
vedras
road
at
the
village
of
morugueira
and
finally
mafra
town
in
the
rear
of
all
was
turned
into
a
defensive
post
by
means
of
trenches
and
barricades
altogether
what
was
by
nature
the
weakest
point
in
the
southern
lines
was
made
by
art
one
of
the
strongest
this
too
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
being
approachable
only
from
torres
vedras
it
was
on
the
whole
not
a
probable
front
on
which
to
expect
an
attack
a
mere
mention
must
suffice
for
the
eighth
section
of
the
defensive
works
the
semicircle
at
julian
s
and
oyeras
which
was
intended
to
protect
the
embarkation
of
the
army
if
the
worst
should
come
it
was
strongly
entrenched
and
could
be
held
by
a
very
few
battalions
while
the
rest
were
utilizing
the
numerous
and
solid
piers
alongside
of
which
the
fleet
of
transports
was
to
be
moored
having
described
the
lines
it
remains
that
we
should
describe
the
garrison
set
to
guard
them
detailing
separately
each
element
regular
and
irregular
the
forces
at
the
disposition
of
wellington
were
materially
increased
at
the
moment
of
his
arrival
within
the
lines
on
october
he
found
at
his
disposition
a
brigade
of
three
battalions
newly
arrived
at
lisbon
the
and
all
old
corunna
regiments
which
had
served
in
the
walcheren
expedition
and
were
still
none
too
healthy
from
their
long
sojourn
in
the
deadly
marshes
of
zeeland
there
had
also
landed
about
the
same
time
the
regiment
and
the
brunswick
oels
light
infantry
a
foreign
battalion
raised
from
the
refugees
who
had
fought
under
the
duke
of
brunswick
in
the
abortive
north
german
insurrection
of
moreover
two
battalions
the
and
had
just
been
sent
to
lisbon
from
cadiz
where
general
graham
now
thought
that
the
british
contingent
was
larger
than
was
absolutely
necessary
the
and
came
out
a
little
later
and
do
not
appear
in
the
fortnighty
general
state
of
the
army
till
november
thus
the
army
was
swelled
by
nine
battalions
or
some
men
no
cavalry
however
had
arrived
about
rank
and
file
with
officers
and
sergeants
and
drummers
by
return
wellington
used
these
new
arrivals
to
form
a
new
division
of
infantry
and
to
complete
to
full
strength
the
division
which
had
hitherto
possessed
only
one
british
brigade
he
did
not
however
keep

the

retired
within

it
is
impossible
to
obtain
any
figures
save
that
they
supplied
the

of
the

just

that
the

have

those
from

still
nothing
better
than
pikes

most
of

were
scattered

in
the
villages
where
they
had
taken
refuge
or
the
camps
of
huts
which
they
had
formed
in
sheltered
situations
they
could
hardly
be
considered
to
be
in
a
state
of
mobilization
and
certainly
were
of
no
use
either
for
garrisoning

or
for
employment
in

of

illustration
lines
of
torres
vedras
lastly
in
calculating
the
forces
which
wellington
accumulated
within
the
lines
we
must
mention
the
two
spanish
divisions
from
the
army
of
estremadura
hearing
that
all
was
quiet
for
the
moment
on
the
frontier
of
andalusia
the
british
commander
had
asked
the
marquis
of
la
romana
whether
in
accordance
with
a
promise
made
so
long
ago
as
july
he
could
spare
any
troops
to
assist
in
the
holding
back
of
the
main
french
army
of
invasion
the
marquis
with
a
liberality
of
which
the
cadiz
regency
would
have
disapproved
if
its
leave
had
been
asked
replied
that
he
would
bring
up
his
two
reserve
divisions
leaving
ballasteros
on
the
andalusian
border
and
another
division
under
imaz
at
badajoz
in
addition
to
the
garrison
and
madden
s
portuguese
cavalry
he
marched
for
aldea
gallega
and
lisbon
with
the
troops
of
la
carrera
and
charles
o
donnell
about
men
on
october
he
had
arrived
at
the
cantonments
behind
mafra
on
the
second
line
of
defence
which
his
ally
had
requested
him
to
occupy
wellington
defended
the
bringing
up
of
these
troops
by
the
plea
that
he
did
not
think
himself
justified
in
not
bringing
into
his
positions
all
the
force
which
was
at
his
disposal
but
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
advantage
of
getting
spanish
troops
within
the
lines
justified
the
danger
incurred
in
estremadura
when
it
was
possible
that
soult
might
send
out
mortier
at
any
moment
to
attack
the
depleted
army
that
covered
the
approach
to
badajoz
napoleon
thought
that
he
should
have
done
so
and
when
he
heard
of
the
arrival
of
la
romana
at
lisbon
wrote
to
censure
the
duke
of
dalmatia
in
the
fiercest
strain
it
was
a
shame
and
a
scandal
that
he
had
retired
to
seville
the
corps
had
orders
to
be
always
at
la
romana
s
heels
and
to
prevent
him
from
moving
into
portugal
so
that
the
news
of
its
return
to
seville
roused
the
emperor
s
surprise
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
napoleon
did
well
to
be
angry
the
balance
of
affairs
in
andalusia
tended
to
stand
at
an
equipoise
precisely
because
la
romana
s
army
was
strong
enough
to
keep
the
corps
employed
when
men
had
been
withdrawn
by
the
marquis
to
the
lisbon
lines
mortier
was
in
a
position
to
sweep
all
before
him
as
far
as
the
gates
of
badajoz
or
to
execute
a
raid
into
the
alemtejo
if
that
course
seemed
preferable
but
soult
did
not
send
his
lieutenant
on
this
errand
on
his
own
initiative
but
waited
till
he
received
direct
orders
to
do
so
from
paris
by
that
time
it
was
too
late
and
neither
the
disaster
of
the
gebora
nor
even
the
fall
of
badajoz
had
any
influence
on
the
course
of
events
in
portugal
masséna
was
forced
to
retreat
before
a
single
patrol
from
the
army
of
andalusia
had
got
into
touch
with
his
outposts
what
might
have
happened
if
soult
had
launched
his
blow
at
badajoz
in
october
and
had
appeared
on
the
left
bank
of
the
lower
tagus
in
december
it
is
impossible
to
say
probably
wellington
would
have
found
some
means
of
averting
disaster
but
it
is
unquestionable
that
his
task
of
defence
would
have
been
made
far
more
difficult
who
had
now
resigned
the
command
of
the
cavalry
and
gone
back
to
his
old
infantry
division
the
vanguard
and
division
of
his
army
vi
xxi
pp
for
the
full
realization
of
the
meaning
of
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
there
are
two
general
facts
which
must
be
remembered
firstly
they
were
garrisoned
by
troops
which
formed
no
part
of
the
field
army
wellington
s
sixty
thousand
regulars
were
not
frittered
away
in
the
garrisoning
of
redoubts
but
were
held
in
masses
behind
the
lines
ready
to
reinforce
any
threatened
point
and
to
deliver
a
pitched
battle
in
the
open
if
the
head
of
the
french
army
were
thrust
through
the
defences
at
some
weak
section
the
generals
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
who
so
often
built
lines
and
were
so
easily
evicted
from
them
suffered
disaster
because
they
drew
out
their
armies
in
one
attenuated
thread
and
were
therefore
weak
at
every
point
and
always
inferior
to
the
assailant
at
the
place
where
he
made
his
assault
wellington
s
army
was
with
the
exception
of
the
division
at
torres
vedras
gathered
in
two
solid
masses
one
facing
sobral
on
the
heights
between
monte
agraça
and
runa
the
second
and
smaller
behind
alhandra
the
one
could
reach
the
other
in
half
a
day
s
march
for
the
roads
behind
and
parallel
to
the
lines
had
been
put
in
good
repair
the
whole
of
this
vast
system
of
redoubts
was
to
be
held
by
the
troops
of
the
second
line
and
by
them
only
there
were
altogether
some
men
of
the
second
line
in
the
fortifications
composed
of
the
afterwards
raised
to
militia
infantry
of
about
portuguese
regular
artillery
aided
by
over
gunners
picked
from
the
militia
and
ordenança
trained
by
the
regulars
and
incorporated
with
them
of
some
british
artillerymen
from
the
batteries
which
had
been
lying
in
reserve
at
lisbon
of
picked
companies
of
the
lisbon
ordenança
atiradores
drilled
into
a
state
of
discipline
not
much
worse
than
that
of
the
militia
of
the
landing
force
of
british
marines
partly
from
the
fleet
partly
brought
specially
from
england
to
garrison
the
proposed
lines
of
embarkation
at
julian
s
of
the
dépôts
convalescents
and
recruits
of
the
eight
line
regiments
of
infantry
raised
from
lisbon
and
southern
estremadura
about
strong
in
all
therefore
there
were
about
men
mostly
troops
of
secondary
quality
or
if
the
spanish
auxiliaries
are
counted
ready
to
man
the
lines
without
a
man
being
withdrawn
from
the
ranks
of
the
field
army
the
outer
lines
were
calculated
to
require
about
men
for
the
redoubts
the
inner
ones
but
clearly
both
did
not
require
to
be
manned
at
once
if
the
outer
line
were
broken
the
from
the
intact
parts
of
it
could
fall
back
on
the
second
meanwhile
the
field
army
would
be
engaging
any
french
columns
that
might
have
broken
through
and
there
would
be
ample
time
to
arrange
for
the
manning
of
the
second
and
stronger
front
but
it
must
be
repeated
once
more
that
it
was
not
on
the
passive
defence
of
the
redoubts
by
their
garrisons
that
wellington
reckoned
for
success
but
on
the
fighting
of
the
field
army
who
would
tackle
the
columns
of
attack
that
had
committed
themselves
to
the
assault
of
the
section
whichever
it
might
be
that
masséna
might
select
as
his
objective
all
criticism
based
on
general
principles
concerning
the
weakness
of
long
extended
lines
falls
to
the
ground
when
it
is
remembered
that
wellington
had
his
army
massed
for
a
pitched
battle
in
and
behind
his
defences
not
strung
out
on
an
interminable
front
the
last
point
on
which
stress
must
be
laid
is
that
the
most
careful
arrangements
for
the
transmission
of
orders
and
intelligence
from
end
to
end
of
the
lines
had
been
made
there
were
five
with
semaphores
worked
by
seamen
on
the
redoubt
no
near
the
atlantic
the
great
redoubt
of
torres
vedras
the

socorro

wellington
s
head
quarters
at
pero
negro
the
summit
of
the
monte
agraça
the
hill
behind
alhandra
on
the
tagus
after
some
practice
it
was
found
that
a
message
could
be
sent
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
miles
in
minutes
and
from
no
the
head
quarters
semaphore
to
either
end
of
the
lines
in
minutes
there
was
a
similar
line
of
four
semaphores
on
the
second
or
main
series
of
defences
military
roads
had
been
opened
behind
both
the
fronts
so
that
troops
could
be
moved
along
the
shortest
possible
line
on
the
other
hand
it
was
fortunate
that
there
existed
no
from
sea
to
sea
the
lines
which
could
be
of
any
practical
use
to
the
invader
the
only
route
of
this
sort
that
from
alemquer
by
sobral
to
runa
was
commanded
for
the
whole
length
from
sobral
to
runa
by
the
british
heights
whose
foot
it
hugs
while
from
sobral
to
alemquer
it
is
separated
from
the
lines
by
the
steep
and
pathless
ridge
of
galaria
across
which
nothing
on
wheels
could
pass
nevertheless
here
lay
the
invaders
best
chance
corps
placed
on
this
road
and
screened
by
the
ridge
could
be
moved
for
some
distance
to
left
or
right
unseen
from
the
lines
the
road
however
was
bad
rocky
and
narrow
it
is
marked
as
the
calçada
arruinada
or
ruined
road
in
contemporary
maps
the
other
paved
road
in
this
direction
that
from
sobral
to
arruda
and
alhandra
passed
through
the
line
of
ground
occupied
by
the
british
at
two
points
and
was
under
fire
from
the
redoubts
at
short
range
for
the
rest
of
its
course
it
was
absolutely
impracticable
it
only
remains
to
be
added
that
the
navy
had
been
utilized
for
auxiliary
service
not
only
were
its
marines
under
orders
to
man
the
julian
s
lines
but
its
seamen
had
fitted
out
all
the
gunboats
in
the
lisbon
arsenal
a
flotilla
of
great
strength
infested
the
tagus
estuary
and
by
the
fire
of
its
heavy
guns
prevented
the
french
from
approaching
the
shore
or
endeavouring
to
build
boats
at
the
mouths
of
its
creeks
if
any
attacks
had
been
made
upon
either
of
the
extreme
ends
of
the
lines
the
columns
delivering
them
would
have
been
under
fire
from
the
sea
throughout
their
operations
but
as
we
shall
see
the
french
never
contemplated
this
the
one
temptation
which
masséna
felt
was
to
assault
far
inland
the
gap
in
front
of
sobral
between
the
monte
agraça
and
the
serra
de
socorro
and
there
as
we
shall
see
at
the
critical
moment
prudence
got
the
better
of
ambition
and
the
invader
turned
back
foiled
the
mark

impossible
to
advance
further
so
the
brigadier
leaving
an
advanced
post
in
villafranca
drew
back
his
three
regiments
to
castanheira
and
sent
his
report
to
montbrun
that
general
himself
with
the
main
body
of
his
cavalry
had
followed
the
rough
road
from
alemquer
to
lisbon
he
drove
in
some
british
dragoon
pickets
and
then
arrived
in
front
of
the
village
of
sobral
which
he
found
occupied
by
the
infantry
outposts
of
spencer
s
division
he
did
not
attempt
to
push
further
that
day
as
his
flanking
reconnaissance
had
come
in
sight
of
the
sections
of
the
lines
behind
arruda
and
behind
zibreira
where
redoubts
and
solid
lines
of
infantry
were
visible
sobral
itself
was
clearly
not
held
in
force
nor
did
it
form
an
integral
part
of
the
british
position
but
montbrun
feared
to
attack
it
when
he
had
only
a
single
brigade
of
infantry
to
the
front
while
many
thousands
of
british
troops
might
issue
from
the
lines
to
overwhelm
him
if
he
committed
himself
to
a
serious
attack
the
village
on
its
knoll
was
left
alone
for
the
present
though
it
was
tempting
to
contemplate
the
seizure
of
a
point
which
lay
so
far
forward
less
than
two
miles
from
the
front
of
wellington
s
chosen
position
but
montbrun
contented
himself
with
sending
back
word
to
masséna
that
he
had
come
upon
a
continuous
line
of
fortifications
stretching
from
the
tagus
bank
to
some
point
westward
which
was
not
yet
discovered
for
his
furthest
reconnaissances
towards
runa
and
the
upper
zizandre
had
found
the
enemy
in
front
of
them
however
far
they
pushed
meanwhile
masséna
s
tired
infantry
of
the
main
body
had
made
hardly
any
movement
the
and
corps
still
lay
about
alcoentre
junot
alone
with
the
corps
advanced
as
far
as
moinho
de
cubo
half
way
between
alcoentre
and
alemquer
thus
wellington
was
given
a
whole
day
more
to
arrange
his
troops
in
their
positions
along
the
lines
on
this
morning
he
was
rather
under
the
impression
that
the
french
attack
would
be
directed
upon
alhandra
and
hill
s
corps
which
he
observed
would
be
a
tough
job
defended
as
all
the
entrances
of
the
valleys
are
by
redoubts
and
the
villages
by
abattis
moreover
the
french
positively
could
not
get
guns
up
to
attack
the
line
west
of
hill
since
in
the
existing
state
of
the
weather
no
cannon
could
leave
the
paved
roads
and
the
only
path
of
that
description
leading
from
the
sobral
direction
to
the
tagus
bank
ran
through
arruda
where
craufurd
and
the
light
division
were
now
comfortably
installed
considering
it
likely
therefore
that
masséna
would
bring
a
heavy
attacking
force
by
circuitous
roads
from
the
rear
to
villafranca
in
order
to
make
a
frontal
attack
on
hill
along
the
by
the
tagus
wellington
warned
craufurd
and
spencer
to
be
ready
to
move
in
eastward
to
the
assistance
of
the
extreme
right
wing
of
the
lines
in
the
afternoon
however
he
discovered
that
the
force
in
front
of
sobral
montbrun
seemed
much
larger
than
that
in
front
of
alhandra
pierre
soult
and
showed
more
signs
of
making
reconnaissances
he
therefore
drew
up
an
alternative
scheme
by
which
in
the
event
of
an
attack
on
spencer
s
front
at
zibreira
cole
s
and
campbell
s
the
new
divisions
were
to
support
the
threatened
point
and
even
picton
was
to
come
in
from
the
distant
torres
vedras
no
french
troops
were
reported
from
this
last
direction
and
de
grey
s
cavalry
pickets
from
ramalhal
far
outside
the
lines
reported
that
not
the
smallest
party
of
the
enemy

horse
had
been
seen

a
movement
which
seemed
to
justify
wellington
s
first
idea
that
hill

to
receive
the
french
attack
he
moved
taupin
s

the
only
hostile
infantry
which
had
yet
been
seen
southward
from
alemquer
to
villafranca
on
the
tagus
this
was
done
however
only
because
the
whole
corps
was
coming
up
on
this
day
from
moinho
de
cubo
by
alemquer
to
sobral
which
it
reached
in
the
afternoon
replacing
taupin

small
force
its
arrival
was
at

reported
to
wellington
who
saw
that
his
second
theory
of
the
intention
of
the
enemy
not
his
first
had
been
correct
and
transferred
his
main
attention

movements
were
accomplished
with
great
fatigue
and
delay
on
this
afternoon

suffered
the

of
its
most
brilliant
and
energetic
cavalry
officer
general
while
exploring
the
tagus
bank
north
of
villafranca
in
search
of
deserted
boats
was
cut
in
two
by
a
cannon
shot
from
a
british
gunboat
which
was
watching

he
was
held
to
be
the
only
officer

colonel
pelet
who
had
any
personal
influence
with

and
as
that
influence
was
always
exerted
on
the
side
of
daring
action
it
is
probable
that
the
many
french
diarists
who
deplore
his
death
are
right
in

that

was
generally
reputed
to
have
been
responsible
for
some
of
the
boldest
moves
made
by
masséna
s
army
during
that
period
that
fririon
is
correct
in
dating
s
death
on
the
and
delagrave
and
others
wrong
in
placing
it
on
the

proved
by
an
entry
in
d
urban
s
diary
of
stating
that
it
had
just
been
discovered
that
the
general
killed
in

of
alhandra
was
called
clearly
then
he
was
dead
before
the
on
the
night
of
the
wellington
had
become
convinced
and
rightly
that
the
great
mass
of
junot
s
corps
visible
behind
sobral
constituted
the
main
danger
to
his
position
he
therefore
drew
in
troops
from
his
right
even
calling
down
from
torres
vedras
picton
in
whose
front
no
enemy
was
yet
visible
from
monte

to
the
portello

he
put
in
line
four
british
divisions

and
campbell
along
with
pack

independent
portuguese
brigade
this
last
was
placed
in
the

redoubt
on
monte
agraça
which
dominated
sobral
and
all
the
lower
hills
in
reserve
were
two
more
divisions
the
under
leith
and
a
temporary
portuguese
division
consisting
of
the
brigades
of
coleman
and
alex
campbell
altogether
men
were
concentrated
on
this
comparatively
short
front
of
about
four
miles
besides
the
militia
and
artillery
who
garrisoned
the
minor
forts
junot
whose
corps
did
not
now
muster
more
than
men
did
wisely
to
refrain
from
making
any
serious
attack
he
was
not
however
wholly
quiescent
attempting
to
extend
his
troops
more
to
the
right
to
the
west
of
sobral
along
the
undulating
ground
in
the
direction
of
the
upper
zizandre
he
got
into
touch
with
the
outlying
pickets
of
cole
s
division
which
stood
beyond
those
of
spencer
and
picton
in
the
british
line

similar
fashion
sent
up
gratien
s
brigade
from
his
second
division
to
reinforce
his
advance
hence
there
ensued
some
sharp
skirmishing
which
lasted
several
hours
till
cole
drew
back
his
outpost

from
the
lower
plateaux
north
of
sobral
to
the
foot
of
his
on

heights
below

junot
had
thus
gained
a
mile
of
ground
but
not
ground
that
was
of
any
service
to
him
for
a
regular
attack
on
the
lines
since
it
was
merely
part
of
the
rolling
upland

was

and
a
much
larger
number
of
portuguese
in
this
long
bicker
hervey
the
portuguese

were
probably
a
little

remarks
that
the
attack
of
this
day
on

cole
s

near
sobral
was
without
much
it
is
certain
however
that
the
british
lost
a
little
ground
in

of
the
heights
martinien
s
des

which
i
so
often

that
junot
s

lost
two
officers
killed
and
seven
wounded
this
at
the
usual
average
would
imply
casualties
on
the
same
afternoon
reynier
with
somewhat
over
a
battalion
of
infantry
made
a
detailed
reconnaissance
of
hill
s
position
in
front
of
alhandra
he
pressed
in
close
enough
to
draw
the
fire
of
the
nearer
redoubts
but
halted
when
he
had
realized
the
strength
of
the
line
opposite
him
and
reported
to
masséna
that
he
considered
the
right
wing
of
the
allied
position
hopelessly
impracticable
for
an
attack
next
morning
october
the
french
came
up
in
person
from
the
rear
it
is
astonishing
that
he
had
made
no
earlier
attempt
to
judge
with
his
own
eye
of
the
strength
of
wellington
s
line
of
defence
he
arrived
at
sobral
in
time
to
witness
a
bitter
skirmish
the
most
important
of
all
the
engagements
that
took
place
during
the
crucial
days
of
the
campaign
of
spencer
s
outposts
as
has
been
already
mentioned
had
on
the
retired
only
some
or
yards
from
sobral
and
had
taken
up
their
position
on
the
other
side
of
the
ravine
that
divides
that
village
from
the
lower
slopes
of
the
monte
agraça
across
the
the
main
picket
furnished
by
the
regiment
had
thrown
up
a
barricade
junot
considered
this
lodgement
so
close
to
his
line
as
a
thing
that
ought
not
to
be
permitted
accordingly
he
brought
up
his
artillery
which
had
only
arrived
from
the
rear
on
the
previous
night
to
the
front
of
sobral
and
after
cannonading
the
barricade
for
a
short
time
sent
against
it
the
d
of
the
of
the
line
supported
by
other
troops
of
ménard
s
brigade
the
first
rush
of
the
attack
carried
the
barricade
and
the
line
of
stone
walls
on
each
side
of
it
but
the
whole
of
the
was
ready
to
sustain
the
pickets
and
with
a
fierce
rush
swept
the
assailants
back
across
the
barricade
down
the
slope
and
into
the
outer
houses
of
sobral
from
thence
of
course
they
had
to
retire
as
a
whole
division
was
fronting
them
but
they
resumed
their
old
position
without
being
pursued
junot
refused
to
renew
his
attack
and
masséna
who
had
arrived
while
the
skirmish
was
in
progress
did
not
direct
him
to
go
forward
again
it
was
clear
that
there
was
a
very
strong
force
in
front
of
the
corps
and
that
the
redoubts
visible
along
the
monte
agraça
on
the
one
hand
and
the
portello
heights
on
the
other
were
of
the
most
formidable
description
masséna
s
senior
and
chief
confidant
pelet
thus
describes
the
psychological
situation
on
arriving
at
sobral
instead
of
the
undulating
accessible
plateaux
that
we
had
been
told
to
expect
we
saw
steeply
scarped
mountains
and
deep
ravines
a
only
a
few
paces
broad
and
on
each
side
walls
of
rock
crowned
with
everything
that
could
be
accomplished
in
the
way
of
field
fortifications
garnished
with
artillery
then
at
last
it
was
plainly
demonstrated
to
us
that
we
could
not
attack
the
lines
of
montechique
with
the
or
men
that
still
remained
of
the
army
for
even
if
we
had
forced
some
point
of
the
lines
we
should
not
have
had
enough
men
left
to
seize
and
occupy
lisbon
it
was
clear
that
we
must
wait
for
reinforcements
another
junot
s
delagrave
in
his
on
the
campaign
of
expresses
the
same
view
in
his
single
sentence
explaining
that
the
prince
seeing
that
the
enemy
was
better
prepared
and
stronger
than
had
been
believed
put
an
end
to
the
combat
and
on
each
side
the
troops
took
up
once
more
their
original
positions
the
loss
in
this
combat
insignificant
enough
in
itself
but
decisive
in
that
it
revealed
to
masséna
the
uselessness
of
a
further
advance
was
on
the
british
side
about
on
that
of
the
french
for
his
position
and
character
see
of
this
volume
this
figure
is
of
course
a
ludicrous
exaggeration
masséna
had
still
more
than
men
even
on
after
suffering
two
months

far
as

he
pressed

near

that

was
fired
at

to

went

out
of
range
some
of
his
continued
the
exploration
till
they
touched
reynier
s
vedettes
near
villafranca
but
the
marshal
himself
returned
to
his
head
quarters
at
alemquer
to
think
over
the
situation
there
some
sort
of
a
council
of
war
was
held
that
same
night
junot
it
is
said
urged
the
chief
to
try
the
effect
of
a
bold
dash
at
the
english
army
arrayed
in
front
of
sobral
but
he
was
talked
down
by
ney
and
reynier
who
argued
that
such
an
attack
would
be
insane
considering
the
weakness
of
their
corps
and
the
strength
of
wellington
s
fortifications
without
doubt
they
were
right
even
if
masséna
had
brought
his
whole
three
corps
to
bear
on
sobral
he
had
men
less
than
at
bussaco
and
wellington
men
more
leaving
the
garrisons
of
the
forts
out
of
the
question
the
allies
had
bayonets
concentrated
on
the
threatened
point
and
could
have
brought
up
hill
craufurd
and
hamilton
s
and
le
cor
s
portuguese
men
more
from
the
east
end
of
the
lines
the
moment
that
it
was
clear
that
reynier
was
no
longer
in
front
of
them
the
position
owing
to
the
forts
was
far
stronger
than
bussaco
and
the
french
cavalry
would
have
been
as
useless
on
october
as
it
had
been
on
september
the
report
which
foy
drew
up
for
masséna
and
presented
to
the
emperor
gives
the
whole
gist
of
the
matter
the
marshal
prince
of
essling
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
would
compromise
the
army
of
his
majesty
if
he
were
to
attack
in
force
lines
so
formidable
defended
by
english
and
portuguese
aided
by
armed
peasants

and
saw
the
marshal
dismount
by
the
windmill
above

he
was
watching
from
pack
s
redoubt
on
the
hill
just
opposite
through
his
telescope
about
yards
from
the
french
front
it
is
jones
who
on
of
his
of
torres
gives
the
anecdote
about
the
marshal
s
salute
see
foy
s
appendix
an
open
assault
on
the
sobral
position
was
now
indeed
the
thing
that
the
british
most
desired
wellington
wrote
with
his
usual
ironical
moderation
to
his
trusted
lieutenant
craufurd
that
he
thought
his
arrangements
had
now
made
the
position
tolerably
secure
among
these
last
arrangements
it
may
be
remarked
was
the
drawing
back
of
the
and
the
light
companies
of
the
division
from
the
barricades
on
the
near
side
of
the
ravine
of
sobral
they
were
moved
a
few
hundred
yards
to
the
rear
nearer
to
zibreira
this
was
probably
intended
to
encourage
the
french
to
sally
out
from
sobral
up
the
road
where
everything
was
now
in
order
to
receive
them
their
advance
was
hourly
expected
d
urban
beresford
s
chief
of
the
staff
wrote
gleefully
on
october
each
individual
division
has
now
more
than
sufficient
troops
to
occupy
the
space
allotted
to
it
and
the
overplus
forms
a
first
reserve
for
each
respectively
if
the
force
thus
posted
beats
the
attacking
enemy
of
which
there
can
be
little
doubt
our
telegraphic
communications
will
bring
down
craufurd
from
arruda
and
hill
from
alhandra
on
to
their
flank
and
the
affair
will
be
complete
there
is
much
appearance
that
the
enemy
attack
this
position
with
his
whole
force
alhandra
is
far
too
strong
for
him
he
can
not
well
retire
and
it
is
hoped
that
his
distress
for
provisions
will
compel
him
to
bring
matters
to
a
speedy
decision
wellington
to
craufurd
vi
d
urban
s
under
but
both
the
cautious
and
the
eager
head
of
the
portuguese
staff
were
mistaken
in
estimating
the
position
they
had
judged
wrongly
the
character
of
masséna
and
his
psychological
position
of
the
moment
he
would
not
attack
indeed
after
october
he
seems
never
to
have
had
the
least
intention
of
doing
so
the
lesson
of
bussaco
had
not
been
lost
and
he
was
no
longer
prepared
to
assail
with
a
light
heart
the
army
posted
ready
to
receive
him
in
a
strong
position
probably
the
energetic
statement
of
ney
and
reynier
that
they
dared
not
risk
their
men
that
the
troops
would
be
demoralized
if
ordered
to
advance
for
a
second
slaughter
also
had
its
effect
on
the
marshal
but
masséna
was
proud
and
obstinate
and
if
he
could
not
go
forward
he
shrank
for
the
moment
from
going
back
on
october
began
the
one
phase
of
the
campaign
which
the
british
from
general
down
to
subaltern
had
least
expected
the
french
army
began
to
show
signs
of
intending
to
settle
down
in
front
of
the
lines
as
if
for
a
blockade
after
a
few
more
attempts
to
feel
the
front
of
the
lines
about
arruda
and
the
valley
of
calandriz
which
were
so
feeble
that
they
did
not
even
drive
in
craufurd
s
outposts
the
enemy
began
to
fortify
the
front
of
his
position
with
and
sent
away
the
whole
of
his
cavalry
to
the
rear
a
sufficient
sign
that
his
offensive
power
was
spent
masséna
s
first
dream
of
masking
the
lines
by
a
close
blockade
was
absolutely
impracticable
considering
the
present
state
of
his
supplies
the
troops
were
already
living
on
the
gleanings
of
the
villages
of
the
lisbon
peninsula
which
could
not
last
them
for
long
and
would
not
even
have
sufficed
for
a
week
s
consumption
if
wellington
s
decrees
had
been
properly
carried
out
if
he
was
to
feed
his
army
from
the
thin
resources
left
behind
by
the
portuguese
masséna
would
soon
find
it
necessary
to
spread
it
far
and
wide
since
if
he
kept
it
concentrated
in
front
of
wellington
it
would
soon
go
to
pieces
exposed
in
bivouacs
to
the
november
rains
and
forced
to
draw
its
nourishment
by
marauding
from
afar
it
seems
from
the
instructions
which
he
gave
to
foy
at
the
end
of
the
second
week
of
his
stay
in
front
of
lisbon
that
the
marshal
actually
contemplated
clinging
to
his
present
advanced
position
till
he
should
receive
reinforcements
he
hoped
that
the
corps
would
come
up
to
his
aid
from
old
castile
and
that
mortier
and
the
corps
would
join
him
from
andalusia
but
these
were
mere
hypotheses
he
was
not
in
touch
with
either
drouet
or
mortier
indeed
he
had
been
cut
off
from
all
communication
with
his
colleagues
since
the
day
that
he
crossed
the
mondego
the
corps
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
only
at
valladolid
and
showed
no
signs
of
moving
on
mortier

retired
to
the
mountains
in
front
of
seville
after
his
successes
over
the
army
of
la
romana
in
september
almeida
was
in
a
state
of
close
blockade
by
silveira
s
detachments
from
beyond
the
douro
ciudad
rodrigo
was
in
hardly
better
case
being
strictly
watched
by
julian
sanchez
and
his
mounted
guerrilleros
so
that
no
one
could
get
to
or
from
it
without
a
very
strong
escort
gardanne
s
regiment
of
dragoons
left
behind
by
masséna
was
worn
out
in
the
effort
to
keep
open
the
road
between
rodrigo
and
salamanca
from
the
army
neither
almeida
nor
rodrigo
received
a
word
of
news
from
the
of
september
to
the
of
november
so
effectually
was
the
road
closed
that
rumours
were
current
of
such
divers
characters
as
that
masséna
had
forced
the
english
to
embark
and
that
he
had
been
completely
foiled
and
was
marching
back
to
spain
via
castello
branco
paris
was
hardly
better
informed
the
only
news
that
the
emperor
got
was
that
dribbled
out
four
or
five
weeks
later
by
the
english
papers
hence
came
ludicrous
notices
in
the
of
which
the
worst
was
one
published
on
november
which
stated
that
coimbra
had
been
occupied
by
masséna
without
a
battle
that
the
army
on
october
had
only
sick
and
wounded
since
it
had
left
almeida
and
that
no
general
or
colonel
had
been
killed
or
even
hurt
since
the
invasion
began
and
this
after
twelve
such
officers
had
fallen
at
bussaco
that
battle
we
may
remark
was
presented
ultimately
to
french
readers
as
a
demonstration
executed
by
the
brigades
of
simon
and
graindorge
in
order
to
mask
the
great
of
the
prince
of
essling
but
they
had
gone
beyond
their
instructions
and
brought
on
a
combat
in
which
men
had
been
killed
and
fririon
the
historian
of
the
campaign
can
not
restrain
himself
from
adding
this
is
how
history
was
written
at
that
time
it
was
by
reports
of
this
lying
description
that
an
attempt
was
made
to
calm
anxious
families
did
no
one
reflect
that
by
deceiving
them
in
this
way
the
government
made
enemies
of
all
those
who
trusted
for
a
time
in
the
exactitude
of
the
and
lost
their
illusion
soon
after
when
they
learnt
the
melancholy
ends
of
their
sons
and
their
brothers
for
the
miseries
and
dangers
of
life
in
rodrigo
see
the
of
the
duchesse
d
abrantes
her
letter
to
junot
intercepted
by
wellington
tells
the
same
tale
it
is
to
be
found
in
d
urban
s
collection
of
documents
see
vol
xxi
pp
see
fririon
pp
the
dearth
of
news
from
the
front
was
not
masséna
s
own
fault
he
had
sent
back
several
to
find
their
way
to
almeida
but
all
had
either
been
captured
by
the
ordenança
or
forced
to
turn
back
the
best
known
of
these
was
the
young
mascarenhas
one
of
the
portuguese
traitors
on
the
marshal
s
staff
he
started
from
coimbra
on
october
with
the
bussaco
dispatch
disguised
as
a
shepherd
but
was
detected
by
a
band
of
ordenança
and
sent
as
prisoner
to
lisbon
the
regency
had
him
tried
by
and
as
he
was
caught
without
a
uniform
he
was
condemned
as
a
spy
as
well
as
a
traitor
and
executed
by
the
garotte
in
december
see
above
there
was
a
perfect
cordon
of
portuguese
militia
and
irregulars
round
masséna

october
and
november
wilson
had
come
down
to
espinhal
and
had
his
outposts
in
leiria
trant
had
returned
to
coimbra
they
were
in
touch
by
means
of
the
estrada
nova
and
the
garrison
of
abrantes
with
the
ordenança
of
castello
branco
and
a
spanish
detachment
of
three
battalions
under
carlos
d

which
la
romana
had
sent
to
villa
velha
at
the
same
time
that
he
took
his
two
divisions
under
la
carrera
and
charles
o
donnell
within
the
lines
on
the
side
of
the
atlantic
the
garrison
of

sent
out
a
force
of

these
joined

with

at

in

of

a
few
french
parties
which
crossed
the
monte
junta
to
raid
towards
the
sea
coast
were
cut
off
either
by
fenwick
or
by
the
dragoons
but
masséna
never
sent
any
serious
detachment
in
this
direction
for
just
one
month
october
masséna
maintained
his
position
in
front
of
the
lines
the
corps
had
thrown
up
some
earthworks
on
and
to
the
flanks
of
the
hill
of
sobral
thus
assuming
a
defensive
instead
of
an
offensive
position
the
corps
went
back
to
carregado
but
left
strong
detachments
in
villafranca
by
the
dispositions
of
october
the
corps
remained
with
its
main
body
at
otta
far
to
the
rear
and
an
advanced
guard
at
alemquer

was
so
placed
that

could
succour
either
of
the
other
corps
if
they
were
attacked

pushed
forward
to

adorning
the

at

each
of

was
directed
to
send
to

all
smiths

other
artificers
that
could
be

they
were
told
to

had

from

a
special
mission

if

had
it
in
his
mind
that
he
might
find
it
convenient
either
to
cross
into
the
alemtejo
or
to
force
a
way
across
the
zezere
into
the
castello

in
the
hope
of
opening
communication
with

montbrun

explored
northward
and
eastward
seeking
for
likely
spots
at
which
the
tagus
might
be
bridged
and
on
the
other
side
reconnoitring
the
line
of
the
zezere
to
see
how
it
was
held
not
a
boat
could
be
found
on
the
greater
river
at
chamusca
a
daring
party
of
fifty
men
swam
its
broad
current
for
a
dash
at
some
barks
which
were
visible
on
the
other
side
but
all
were
found
to
have
had
their
bottoms
carefully
knocked
out
and
to
be
filled
with
sand
dejean
the
officer
who
explored
as
far
as
punhete
on
the
zezere
found
all
the
bridges
broken
and
the
garrison
of
abrantes
watching
the
fords
with
strong
detachments
at

and
martinchel

at

he
had
to
create

no

work
from
there
was
raw
iron
in
the
bars
and
balconies
of
houses
and
raw
timber
in
their
floors

rafters
but
nothing
else
his
smiths
had
to
start
on
the
weary
task
of
forging
saws
and
hammers
his
carpenters
had
to
turn
housebreakers
in
the
technical
sense
to
obtain
planks
and
joists
his
task
was
hard
and
would
clearly
take
many
weeks
before
it
could
be
properly
accomplished
meanwhile
time
was
to
masséna
for
every
day
the
country
between

grew
barer
and
yet
more
bare

the
foragers
of

after

the

official
documents
wellington
was
already
pondering
on
the
possibility
of
taking
the
offensive
he
had
received
hundreds
of
deserters
during
the
last
few
weeks
and
knew
by
their
means
of
the
miserable
condition
of
the
enemy
of
the
fact
that
the
cavalry
had
nearly
all
been
sent
to
the
rear
and
of
the
attempt
that
was
being
made
to
create
a
at
santarem
his
dispatches
of
october
and
november
to
lord
liverpool
treat
at
length
of
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
assailing
the
french
in
their
present
position
he
sets
forth
the
strength
of
his
own
army
british
troops
present
with
the
colours
after
deducting
sick
and
men
detached
portuguese
effective
and
of
la
romana
s
spaniards
making
a
total
of
he
refuses
to
contemplate
the
use
of
the
militia
infantry
or
artillery
in
the
field
considering
their
behaviour
at
bussaco
and
elsewhere
i
should
deceive
myself
if
i
could
expect
or
your
lordship
if
i
should
state
that
any
advantage
would
be
derived
from
their
assistance
in
an
offensive
operation
against
the
on
the
other
hand
he
estimates
masséna
s
fighting
force
at
men
a
slight
miscalculation
for
there
were
only
effective
at
this
moment
and
of
these
cavalry
and
one
brigade
of
infantry
were
at
santarem
and
other
distant
places
from
which
they
could
not
have
been
withdrawn
for
a
battle
suddenly
forced
upon
their
main
corps
masséna
could
really
have
put
no
more
than
men
in
line
within
hours
of
an
alarm
wellington
then
proceeds
to
argue
that
he
must
make
a
frontal
attack
for
if
he
drew
a
very
large
force
out
of
the
lines
in
order
to
assail
the
enemy
s
flank
by
a
wide
encircling
march
the
inevitable
consequence
of
attempting
such
a
manœuvre
would
be
to
open
some
one
or
other
of
the
great
roads
to
lisbon
and
to
our
shipping
of
which
the
enemy
would
take
immediate
advantage
to
attain
his
accordingly
we
must
carry
their
positions
by
main
force
and
in
the
course
of
the
operation
i
must
draw
the
army
out
of
their
cantonments
and
expose
men
and
horses
to
the
inclemencies
of
the
weather
at
this
time
of
the
moreover
if
masséna
were
defeated
it
would
cause
soult
to
evacuate
granada
raise
the
siege
of
cadiz
and
come
with
men
to
aid
the
army
of
portugal
so
if
i
should
succeed
in
forcing
masséna
s
positions
it
would
become
a
question
whether
i
should
be
able
to
maintain
my
own
in
case
the
enemy
should
march
another
army
into
this
blake
and
the
garrison
of
cadiz
when
freed
from
soult
s
presence
would
certainly
do
nothing
to
help
the
general
cause
of
the
allies
they
would
neither
come
to
portugal
nor
be
able
to
make
a
serious
advance
on
madrid
so
as
to
draw
off
soult
in
that
direction
he
therefore
concludes
that
when
i
observe
how
small
the
superiority
of
numbers
is
in
my
favour
and
know
that
the
position
will
be
in
favour
of
the
enemy
i
am
of
opinion
that
i
act
in
conformity
with
the
intentions
of
his
majesty
s
government
in
waiting
for
the
result
of
what
is
going
on
and
in
incurring
no
extraordinary
what
he
calls
the
safe
game
is
to
keep
on
the
strict
defensive
hoping
that
the
enemy
s
distress
for
provisions
and
the
operations
of
the
militia
in
his
rear
may
cause
him
either
to
make
a
desperate
attack
on
the
lines
in
which
he
will
be
repulsed
with
awful
loss
or
else
to
make
such
large
detachments
to
clear
off
the
corps
of
wilson
trant
and
the
rest
that
it
will
become
easy
and
safe
to
attack
the
remaining
army
in
its
present
position
the
first
morning
note
of
d
urban
s
diary
in
november
is
nearly
always
more
deserters
see
wellington
to
lord
liverpool
vi
see
especially
the
longer
dispatch
of
on
pp
ibid
here
as
when
we
considered
the
reasons
which
determined
wellington
to
evacuate
the
coimbra
country
at
the
end
of
september
we
are
bound
to
recognize
that
he
adopted
an
attitude
of
caution
which
he
would
not
have
assumed
in
and
when
he
had
thoroughly
proved
his
army
the
temptations
to
assail
junot
s
isolated
and
advanced
position
at
sobral
were
enormous
the
corps
had
been
thrust
forward
into
a
angle
of
the
british
lines
in
which
it
could
be
attacked
from
the
left
flank
as
well
as
from
the
front
it
was
wasting
away
daily
from
its
privations
and
had
apparently
not
more
than
bayonets
left
the
cavalry
of
the
corps
s
old
division
had
been
sent
off
to
santarem
save
one
regiment
to
sustain
junot
the
corps
could
eventually
be
used
but
only
one
brigade
of
it
that
of
ferey
was
in
the
first
line
and
this
depleted
unit
which
had
been
so
thoroughly
routed
at
bussaco
had
its
old
enemy
craufurd
s
light
division
in
its
front
of
the
rest
of
the
corps
one
division
was
at
alemquer
eleven
miles
behind
sobral
the
other
at
otta
six
miles
behind
alemquer
it
would
have
taken
the
one
four
or
five
hours
the
other
nearly
the
whole
of
a
short
november
day
to
assemble
and
to
come
up
reynier
could
not
quit
hill
s
front
without
freeing
the
latter
s
two
strong
divisions
for
action
meanwhile
wellington
had
disposable
in
junot
s
immediate
front
the
divisions
of
spencer
cole
leith
and
alex
campbell
picton
had
been
sent
back
to
torres
vedras
plus
the
portuguese
brigades
of
pack
coleman
and
campbell
with
la
romana
s
spaniards
also
if
he
should
choose
to
employ
them
this
too
after
leaving
craufurd
to
look
after
ferey
and
hill
to
keep
reynier
in
check
it
is
impossible
not
to
conclude
that
a
sudden
frontal
and
flank
attack
on
sobral
with
men
must
have
enveloped
and
crushed
the
corps
though
its
position
was
good
its
supports
were
too
far
off
ney
could
not
have
come
up
to
junot
s
aid
before
he
was
overwhelmed
masséna
was
uneasy
about
this
possibility
of
disaster
and
had
issued
orders
on
october
that
if
junot
and
ferey
were
attacked
they
were
to
fall
back
on
alemquer
while
ney
was
to
bring
up
his
reserves
to
that
same
place
and
reynier
to
abandon
his
position
in
front
of
alhandra
and
march
on
alemquer
also
but
the
weak
point
of
this
arrangement
was
that
if
junot
had
been
attacked
at
dawn
both
in
front
and
flank
by
an
overwhelming
force
he
could
never
have
got
back
to
alemquer
and
must
have
been
cut
off
and
battered
to
pieces
close
in
the
rear
of
sobral
the
english
frontal
attack
spencer
leith
and
pack
would
have
started
at
a
distance
of
less
than
a
mile
from
his
position
cole
and
campbell
on
the
flank
had
only
two
miles
to
cover
both
columns
had
a
march
before
them
till
the
line
of
rising
ground
about
sobral
was
reached
how
could
the
corps
have
got
away
even
an
orderly
retreat
with
a
fighting
rearguard
would
have
been
impossible
loison
to
whom
ferey
s
brigade
belonged
had
gone
to
the
rear
with
his
other
brigade
the
whole
dispatch
may
be
found
in
fririon
pp
that
officer
quite
saw
the
danger
of
the
position
see
his
comments
on
pp
but
if
junot
s
men
had
been
destroyed
behind
sobral
wellington
would
then
have
been
in
the
position
to
push
in
between
ney
and
reynier
whose
columns
would
just
have
been
beginning
to
near
alemquer
he
might
easily
have
driven
them
apart
and
have
forced
them
to
retire
on
santarem
or
some
such
distant
point
in
order
to
complete
their
junction
even
had
they
succeeded
in
joining
masséna
would
have
had
a
demoralized
army
of
little
over
men
remaining
it
is
certain
that
he
must
have
refused
to
fight
and
have
started
on
a
disastrous
retreat
either
by
castello
branco
or
more
likely
by
thomar
for
the
latter
direction
would
have
brought
him
to
his
base
at
almeida
the
former
would
have
taken
him
through
an
almost
uninhabited
country
to
a
part
of
spain
the
where
no
french
army
was
ready
to
receive
or
succour
him
it
is
impossible
therefore
to
doubt
that
wellington
had
a
great
opportunity
before
him
yet
it
is
easy
to
see
why
he
refused
to
take
it
a
mere
victory
of
the
second
class
the
thrusting
of
junot
out
of
his
positions
not
followed
by
the
complete
annihilation
of
the
corps
would
have
done
no
more
for
him
than
he
himself
stated
in
the
dispatch
of
november
if
junot
got
away
with
the
main
body
of
his
troops
and
joined
ney
and
reynier
and
if
their
united
army
took
up
a
defensive
position
at
santarem
or
elsewhere
masséna
might
still
hang
on
to
portugal
till
soult
brought
up
to
his
aid
the
whole
army
of
andalusia
or
great
reinforcements
arrived
from
castile
any
chance
a
fog
heavy
rain
the
rashness
or
stupidity
of
some
subordinate
might
prevent
the
complete
and
instantaneous
success
of
the
attack
on
sobral
these
things
being
taken
into
consideration
wellington
resolved
to
lie
still
in
the
lines
and
to
let
the
weapon
of
starvation
play
for
some
time
longer
on
the
french
he
expected
them
to
retire
within
a
few
days
from
sheer
necessity
or
else
to
deliver
the
much
desired
attack
on
his
impregnable
position
masséna
had
found
that
the
preparation
of
his
bridge
equipage
at
santarem
would
be
a
long
business
he
knew
that
his
numbers
were
shrinking
every
day
in
the
most
appalling
fashion
not
only
from
deaths
and
invaliding
but
from
desertion
yet
he
stood
still
for
a
fortnight
longer
than
his
adversary
had
expected
and
meanwhile
made
a
last
desperate
appeal
for
help
to
the
emperor
he
had
guessed
that
all
his
previous
attempts
to
communicate
with
spain
had
failed
because
his
messengers
had
been
sent
without
a
sufficient
escort
and
had
fallen
by
the
way
accordingly
he
told
off
a
body
of
more
than
men
to
bear
his
next
letter
and
gave
the
command
of
them
to
an
officer
of
intelligence
and
resource
foy
who
had
served
in
all
the
three
portuguese
campaigns
junot
s
of
soult
s
of
and
this
last
of
his
own
moreover
it
was
known
that
napoleon
had
confidence
in
his
ability
though
he
was
an
old
republican
and
had
actually
been
one
of
the
few
who
had
refused
to
sign
the
address
which
was
drawn
up
to
ask
the
first
consul
to
declare
himself
emperor
in
foy
was
given
a
whole
battalion
of
infantry
the
of
the
of
the
line
with
mounted
men
he
was
told
to
avoid
the
main
roads
to
cross
the
zezere
pass
north
of
castello
branco
and
to
try
to
reach
spain
by
way
of
sabugal
or
penamacor
this
was
obviously
a
difficult
task
since
the
ordenança
were
known
to
be
abroad
even
in
this
rugged
and
deserted
region
to
cover
foy
s
start
montbrun
marched
with
a
brigade
of
dragoons
and
a
couple
of
battalions
of
infantry
to
make
a
demonstration
against
abrantes
and
draw
the
attention
of
its
garrison
from
the
upper
zezere
montbrun
forced
the
passage
of
the
river
at
punhete
after
a
sharp
skirmish
and
established
his
vanguard
on
the
further
side
he
thus
attracted
to
himself
all
the
forces
which
lobo
the
governor
of
abrantes
could
spare
outside
his
walls
meanwhile
october
foy
passed
the
zezere
higher
up
at
an
unguarded
ford
and
marched
by
cardigos
and
sobreira
formosa
along
the
castello
branco
road
but
he
abandoned
it
before
reaching
that
town
and
turned
north
crossing
the
serra
de
moradal
by
fundão
and
belmonte
from
thence
he
reached
sabugal
and
finally
ciudad
rodrigo
on
november
he
had
been
unmolested
save
by
a
body
of
ordenança
who
cut
off
some
of
his
stragglers
the
passage
of
his
column
whose
strength
was
exaggerated
by
rumour
caused
carlos
d
españa
to
burn
the
bridge
of
villa
velha
under
the
impression
that
foy
intended
to
seize
it
and
open
up
communication
southward
with
soult
he
and
lobo
reported
to
wellington
that
foy
and
montbrun
were
the
van
of
a
great
force
which
was
about
to
overrun
and
occupy
the
castello
branco
country
but
masséna
s
messenger
had
no
other
object
than
to
reach
castile
with
as
great
rapidity
as
possible
and
without
fighting
wellington
also
on
lobo
s
report
thought
vi
that
foy
s
and
montbrun
s
object
had
been
to
seize
the
bridge
of
villa
velha
arrived
at
rodrigo
foy
gave
over
his
escort
to
general
gardanne
with
orders
to
him
to
collect
all
the
convalescents
of
the
army
of
portugal
and
to
draw
out
the
garrison
of
rodrigo
and
almeida
if
drouet
was
now
in
condition
to
take
charge
of
these
fortresses
this
should
give
him
a
force
of
men
with
which
he
was
ordered
to
cut
his
way
to
join
the
main
army
to
whom
he
was
to
bring
a
convoy
of
ammunition
which
was
running
desperately
low
at
the
front
how
badly
gardanne
executed
his
charge
we
shall
presently
see
foy
meanwhile
with
a
fresh
dragoon
escort
rode
for
salamanca
and
valladolid
at
which
last
place
he
was
disgusted
to
find
drouet
and
the
bulk
of
the
corps
whom
he
had
expected
to
meet
at
rodrigo
he
met
the
general
and
passed
on
to
him
masséna
s
request
that
he
would
collect
the
whole
of
his
men
and
march
on
almeida
and
from
thence
down
the
mondego
to
coimbra
after
which
he
was
to
open
up
communication
with
the
main
army
by
leiria
or
thomar
drouet
assuming
some
of
the
airs
of
a
did
not
show
the
eagerness
to
carry
out
these
directions
which
foy
had
hoped
to
find
only
part
of
claparéde
s
division
had
as
yet
even
reached
salamanca
foy
to
masséna
from
rodrigo
from
valladolid
foy
rode
straight
through
by
post
braving
guerrilla
bands
and
swollen
rivers
through
burgos
and
bayonne
to
paris
which
he
reached
on
the
night
of
november
on
the
next
day
he
delivered
his
dispatches
to
the
emperor
and
was
put
through
two
hours
of
sharp
by
his
master
the
notes
of
this
conversation
taken
down
the
same
afternoon
by
the
general
are
one
of
the
most
interesting
documents
for
the
study
of
napoleon
s
psychology
striding
up
and
down
his
study
pouring
out
strings
of
queries
rapid
judgements
rebukes
and
laudations
even
anecdotes
and
screeds
of
political
philosophy
the
emperor
presented
a
wonderful
picture
of
restless
and
intellectual
activity
foy
put
in
his
excuses
and
explanations
in
the
gaps
of
the
emperor
s
tirades
why
the
devil
did
masséna
thrust
himself
into
that
muddle
at
bussaco
even
in
a
plain
country
columns
do
not
break
through
lines
unless
they
are
supported
by
a
superior
artillery
and
the
disgrace
at
coimbra
where
he
has
let
his
hospitals
be
taken
by
ragged
rascals
to
lose
your
hospitals
is
as
disgraceful
as
to
lose
your
flags
in
a
regularly
organized
country
england
for
example
masséna
would
have
gone
to
the
scaffold
for
that
job
the
english
are
full
of
courage
and
honour
they
defend
themselves
well
masséna
and
ney
did
not
know
them
but
reynier
whom
they
had
beaten
twice
or
thrice
alexandria
and
maida
ought
to
know
them
wellington
has
behaved
like
a
clever
man
his
total
desolation
of
the
kingdom
of
portugal
is
the
result
of
systematic
measures
splendidly
concerted
i
could
not
do
that
myself
for
all
my
power
why
did
not
masséna
stop
at
coimbra
after
bussaco
because
faltered
foy
supposing
he
had
done
so
your
majesty
would
have
reproached
him
by
saying
if
you
had
only
pushed
straight
on
lisbon
the
english
would
have
very
possible
indeed
replied
the
emperor
breaking
into
a
broad
smile
well
i
wanted
to
drive
them
into
the
sea
i
have
failed
all
right
then
i
will
have
a
regular
campaign
in
portugal
and
use
them
up
i
can
wear
them
down
in
the
nature
of
things
because
england
can
not
compete
in
mere
numbers
with
then
followed
an
excursus
into
the
characters
of
french
generals
junot
ney
soult
especially
then
a
curious
confession
that
he
had
made
a
miscalculation
in
taking
up
the
spanish
war
i
thought
the
system
easier
to
change
than
it
has
proved
in
that
country
with
its
corrupt
minister
its
feeble
king
and
its
shameless
dissolute
queen
but
for
all
that
i
don
t
repent
of
what
i
did
i
had
to
smash
up
that
nation
sooner
or
later
they
would
have
done
me
a
bad
échauffourée
then
comes
the
emperor
s
conclusion
upon
the
present
state
of
affairs
masséna
must
take
abrantes
elvas
would
be
of
no
good
to
us
the
only
way
to
get
wellington
to
make
a
forward
move
will
be
to
force
him
to
try
to
raise
the
siege
of
abrantes
as
long
as
masséna
stays
in
position
opposite
lisbon
nothing
is
lost
he
is
still
a
terror
to
the
english
and
keeps
the
offensive
if
he
retreats
i
fear
great
disaster
for
him
but
why
did
he
not
take
up
some
regular
plan
of
operations
the
very
day
after
he
reconnoitred
the
lisbon
lines
it
was
clear
that
he
would
never
attack
them
i
will
send
immediate
orders
for
the
corps
mortier
to
invade
the
alemtejo
will
they
be
obeyed
at
that
distance
only
those
who
choose
carry
out
my
directions
a
hint
at
soult
s
selfish
policy
i
tremble
lest
masséna
may
call
drouet
down
to
him
and
then
get
his
communications
cut
again
by
communications
i
mean
sure
points
at
two
or
three
marches
distance
properly
garrisoned
and
provisioned
where
convoys
can
rest
and
be
safe
an
army
without
open
communications
loses
heart
and
gets
demoralized
all
the
hope
of
the
english
is
in
that
army
of
wellington
s
if
we
could
destroy
it
it
would
be
a
terrible
blow
to
the
emperor
pleased
with
foy
s
intelligent
explanations
of
the
situation
created
him
a
general
of
division
and
told
him
to
rest
for
a
month
and
then
return
to
portugal
he
sent
for
him
to
administer
a
second
catechism
on
the
and
then
condescended
to
explain
his
view
of
the
situation
and
his
orders
for
the
future
he
quite
approved
of
masséna
s
resolve
to
hold
out
in
front
of
the
lines
and
had
already
given
drouet
directions
to
assemble
his
corps
at
almeida
and
open
up
communications
with
the
army
of
portugal
in
fact
the
order
to
do
so
had
been
sent
off
as
early
as
november
and
its
bearer
must
have
crossed
foy
somewhere
on
the
road
soult
had
also
been
ordered
two
days
before
masséna
s
appeal
came
to
hand
to
create
a
diversion
in
the
direction
of
spanish
estremadura
he
was
now
sent
a
sharp
reproof
for
having
done
nothing
and
more
especially
for
having
allowed
la
romana
to
slip
away
with
two
divisions
to
lisbon
unmolested
but
it
seems
clear
that
no
orders
to
concentrate
his
whole
army
and
invade
the
alemtejo
were
sent
him
and
these
were
the
only
measures
that
could
have
helped
masséna
napoleon
s
that
it
would
be
no
use
to
besiege
and
capture
elvas
shows
a
misapprehension
of
the
situation
a
mere
demonstration
in
spanish
estremadura
might
call
back
la
romana
but
would
not
help
the
army
of
portugal
to
any
appreciable
extent
it
was
not
la
romana
s
men
who
formed
the
strength
of
the
defence
of
lisbon
wellington
could
have
spared
them
without
harm
and
indeed
sent
them
away
long
before
masséna
quitted
portugal
this
is
the
order
in
it
goes
on
to
give
drouet
detailed
orders
as
to
what
he
should
do
aussitôt
que
les
anglais
seront
this
had
been
sent
off
the
day
before
foy
arrived
it
is
dated
it
may
be
added
that
as
facts
were
to
show
ere
long
the
mere
sending
up
of
drouet
to
the
front
was
not
nearly
sufficient
to
put
masséna
in
a
position
to
incommode
wellington
more
especially
when
the
corps
was
told
to
drop
detachments
at
short
intervals
at
every
stage
after
almeida
by
following
these
orders
indeed
drouet
brought
to
the
main
army
a
mere
men
on
december
having
left
the
rest
of
his
corps
beyond
the
mondego
his
arrival
was
of
absolutely
no
use
to
the
prince
of
essling
the
one
thing
which
could
have
saved
masséna
was
the
arrival
not
of
a
small
field
force
such
as
drouet
or
mortier
commanded
but
of
a
large
army
on
the
lower
tagus
and
on
its
southern
side
such
an
army
as
the
disposition
of
the
french
troops
in
spain
then
stood
could
only
have
been
produced
if
soult
had
consented
to
abandon
granada
raise
the
siege
of
cadiz
and
march
with
the
greater
part
of
the
army
of
andalusia
into
the
alemtejo
masking
badajoz
and
elvas
and
leaving
a
division
or
two
in
seville
to
keep
blake
and
the
spanish
troops
from
cadiz
in
check
but
the
duke
of
dalmatia
could
never
be
induced
to
abandon
of
his
andalusian
viceroyalty
in
order
to
execute
a
movement
whose
results
if
successful
would
mainly
redound
to
the
glory
of
masséna
nothing
short
of
a
definite
and
peremptory
order
from
paris
would
have
made
him
call
in
victor
and
sebastiani
and
evacuate
eastern
and
southern
andalusia
such
an
order
the
emperor
did
not
send
his
dispatch
of
only
ordered
that
a
corps
of
men
should
advance
to
the
tagus
in
the
direction
of
villa
velha
and
montalvão
to
communicate
with
masséna
soult
undertook
instead
a
blow
at
badajoz
in
january
with
a
force
of
men
while
leaving
cadiz
still
blockaded
and
granada
still
held
napoleon
therefore
must
take
the
blame
of
the
final
failure
of
the
invasion
of
portugal
as
has
been
shown
above
from
his
own
words
he
was
conscious
that
he
was
too
far
from
the
scene
of
operation
and
that
mere
ordinary
directions
to
his
lieutenants
might
not
be
carried
out
with
zeal
je
donne
l
ordre
l
de
si
loin
obéit
qui
veut
but
if
this
were
so
it
was
surely
necessary
either
that
he
should
go
to
spain
in
person
or
else
the
more
obvious
alternative
that
he
should
appoint
a
real
in
the
peninsula
who
should
have
authority
to
order
all
the
other
marshals
and
generals
to
obey
his
directions
without
malingering
or
appeals
to
paris
napoleon
had
deliberately
created
a
divided
authority
beyond
the
pyrenees
when
he
set
up
his
military
governments
and
instructed
suchet
kellermann
and
the
other
governors
to
report
directly
to
himself
and
to
pay
no
attention
to
commands
emanating
from
madrid
king
joseph
as
a
central
source
of
orders
had
been
reduced
to
a
nullity
by
this
decree
even
over
the
troops
not
included
in
the
new
viceroyalties
he
had
no
practical
authority
not
he
and
his
chief
of
the
staff
but
masséna
ought
to
have
been
entrusted
with
a
full
and
autocratic
power
of
command
over
all
the
armies
of
spain
if
a
true
unity
of
purpose
was
to
be
achieved
berthier
to
soult
see
above
see
pp
and
above
this
necessary
arrangement
the
emperor
utterly
refused
to
carry
out
he
sent
rebukes
to
drouet
for
hesitating
to
obey
the
orders
of
the
prince
of
essling
and
he
jested
at
the
absurd
conduct
of
ney
and
junot
in
conducting
themselves
like
independent
generals
but
these
officers
were
in
command
of
troops
definitely
allotted
to
the
army
of
portugal
over
the
other
generals
of
spain
he
refused
to
allow
masséna
any
control
and
he
continued
to
send
them
his
own
instructions
which
had
often
ceased
to
be
appropriate
long
before
the
dispatch
had
reached
its
destination
if
we
seek
the
reasons
of
this
unwise
persistence
in
his
old
methods
we
find
that
they
were
two
the
first
was
his
secret
but
only
intention
to
annex
all
the
spanish
provinces
north
of
the
ebro
to
france
an
insane
resolve
which
led
him
to
keep
suchet
and
macdonald
in
aragon
and
catalonia
as
well
as
the
governors
of
navarre
and
biscay
out
of
the
control
of
any
central
authority
that
he
might
set
up
in
spain
the
second
was
his
jealousy
of
entrusting
the
vast
army
south
of
the
ebro
far
more
than
men
at
the
moment
to
any
single
commander
he
remembered
soult
s
absurd
strivings
after
royalty
in
portugal
he
knew
that
masséna
though
the
best
of
soldiers
was
false
selfish
and
ambitious
and
he
refused
to
hand
over
to
either
of
them
a
full
control
over
the
whole
of
the
forces
in
the
peninsula
it
was
even
better
in
his
estimation
to
leave
king
joseph
a
shadow
of
power
than
to
take
the
risk
of
giving
overmuch
authority
to
one
of
the
two
able
but
not
wholly
trustworthy
marshals
to
whom
he
must
otherwise
have
entrusted
it
see
the
conversation
with
foy
in
the
latter
s
the
war
in
portugal
therefore
went
on
as
a
mere
section
of
the
great
contest
in
the
peninsula
the
other
and
less
important
episodes
were
not
made
wholly
subordinate
to
it
and
if
this
system
continued
wellington
was
free
from
any
real
danger
he
knew
it
himself
he
studied
diligently
both
the
political
position
and
the
details
of
the
emplacement
of
the
imperial
armies
in
the
peninsula
he
was
fortunate
enough
to
secure
whole
budgets
of
french
dispatches
captured
by
the
ordenança
and
all
that
he
read
confirmed
him
in
his
conclusion
i
calculate
he
writes
on
october
that
a
reinforcement
of
men
would
not
now
give
the
enemy
so
good
an
army
as
they
had
at
bussaco
he
lost
killed
or
taken
there
trant
took
at
coimbra
above
prisoners
have
gone
through
this
army
many
have
been
killed
by
the
peasantry
they
can
not
have
less
than
sick
after
the
march
they
have
made
and
the
weather
to
which
they
are
exposed
the
deserters
tell
us
that
almost
every
one
is
sick
from
this
statement
you
may
judge
of
the
diminution
of
their
numbers
and
you
will
see
that
i
have
not
much
reason
to
apprehend
anything
from
drouet
s
beaux
which
fought
at
essling
and
which
can
not
be
here
before
the
middle
of
november
i
do
not
think
i
have
much
to
apprehend
even
if
mortier
is
added
to
them
however
we
shall
see
how
will
be
all
the
accounts
which
i
receive
of
the
distresses
of
the
enemy
for
want
of
provisions
would
tend
to
a
belief
that
their
army
can
not
remain
long
in
the
position
in
which
it
is
placed
and
it
is
astonishing
that
they
have
been
able
to
remain
here
so
long
as
this
that
they
have
succeeded
in
staying
even
a
fortnight
in
front
of
the
lines
is
he
adds
entirely
the
fault
of
the
portuguese
government
for
not
carrying
out
thoroughly
the
work
of
devastation
but
for
the
reasons
stated
on
an
earlier
page
wellington
was
resolved
not
to
take
the
offensive
even
against
a
foe
whose
ranks
were
beginning
to
grow
thin
famine
should
do
the
work
and
no
lives
should
be
wasted
see
for
example
those
noted
in
vi
and
a
whole
series
copied
out
in
d
urban
s
journal
in
october
and
november
a
most
modest
estimate
for
the
returns
of
sick
for
the
second
half
of
october
in
a
document
at
the
de
la
give
a
total
of
men
in
hospital
an
allusion
to
a
phrase
in
one
of
the
captured
dispatches
wellington
to
liverpool
october
pp
and
of
vol
vi
there
remained
only
one
danger
it
was
just
possible
that
soult
even
though
masséna
had
not
yet
suffered
any
disaster
great
enough
to
make
the
evacuation
of
eastern
andalusia
imperative
might
send
mortier
and
some
additional
divisions
of
his
other
corps
to
spanish
estremadura
and
make
a
dash
at
the
lower
tagus
masséna
s
at
santarem
of
which
every
deserter
spoke
might
be
intended
to
give
him
the
materials
for
a
bridge
by
which
he
might
communicate
across
the
lower
tagus
with
soult
wellington
accordingly
resolved
to
keep
a
strict
watch
beyond
the
tagus
and
to
have
a
flying
force
ready
which
could
hinder
the
construction
of
a
bridge
or
a
bridge
head
with
this
object
on
november
he
sent
over
the
tagus
general
fane
with
his
portuguese
horse
a
battalion
of
caçadores
and
a
few
guns
all
the
north
alemtejo
ordenança
were
called
out
to
watch
the
river
banks
and
to
lend
what
small
assistance
they
could
to
the
cavalry
fane
discovered
the
french
dockyard
at
santarem
and
tried
to
fire
it
with
rockets
on
november
he
failed
but
the
mere
appearance
of
his
little
force
on
the
further
bank
of
the
tagus
had
some
good
effect
since
it
warned
masséna
that
an
attempt
to
pass
the
broad
river
would
not
be
unopposed
and
therefore
made
him
more
chary
of
attempting
it
fane
being
in
touch
with
abrantes
on
his
right
hand
and
with
lisbon
on
his
left
now
formed
as
it
were
a
section
of
the
blockading
screen
which
was
thrown
round
the
whole
french
army
wellington
had
miscalculated
the
time
which
the
french
could
afford
to
spend
in
front
of
the
lines
without
suffering
actual
starvation
by
about
a
fortnight
on
november
masséna
gave
orders
for
the
evacuation
of
his
whole
position
and
a
general
retreat
on
santarem
because
it
had
become
absolutely
impossible
to
stay
any
longer
on
the
ground
facing
zibreira
and
alhandra
unless
the
whole
army
was
to
perish
the
report
from
the
corps
may
suffice
to
give
in
a
few
words
the
condition
of
affairs
general
clausel
wishes
to
observe
that
during
the
daytime
he
can
not
count
on
any
other
troops
save
those
actually
guarding
the
outpost
line
the
majority
of
the
men
are
absent
on
raids
to
the
rear
to
seek
for
maize
and
cattle
the
last
detachment
which
came
back
to
camp
had
been
nine
days
away
generals
and
soldiers
agree
in
stating
that
for
some
time
it
has
only
been
possible
to
collect
a
little
corn
with
extreme
difficulty
for
eight
days
the
troops
have
been
living
on
polenta
boiled
maize
flour
alone
and
of
this
they
have
received
only
half
a
ration
during
the
last
four
days
the
division
has
received
only
one
ration
of
meat
which
amounted
to
six
ounces
of
goat
if
the
corps
had
to
make
a
retreat
it
would
have
to
abandon
its
sick
and
wounded
for
want
of
carts
which
the
will
not
furnish
the
condition
of
the
and
corps
was
only
so
far
better
that
they
had
to
send
their
foragers
a
less
distance
when
seeking
for
the
scanty
store
which
could
still
be
gleaned
from
the
hidden
granaries
of
the
portuguese
fririon
s
confidential
report
to
masséna
night
of
of
november
but
masséna
had
no
intention
of
retiring
on
spain
when
he
began
to
issue
orders
for
a
general
movement
to
the
rear
profoundly
sensible
of
the
difficulties
of
a
november
retreat
through
the
mountains
trusting
that
he
might
block
the
british
army
by
maintaining
a
bold
attitude
in
its
front
and
still
hoping
that
large
reinforcements
might
reach
him
ere
long
from
drouet
and
mortier
he
had
resolved
only
to
evacuate
the
lisbon
peninsula
and
to
retire
no
further
than
to
the
flat
and
fertile
lands
between
santarem
and
the
zezere
in
the
plain
of
golegão
as
it
is
sometimes
called
he
hoped
to
feed
his
army
for
many
weeks
more
for
the
region
was
still
comparatively
full
of
resources
since
it
had
only
been
exploited
as
yet
by
the
garrison
of
santarem
and
the
flying
columns
which
had
marched
to
the
zezere
it
was
now
his
cherished
hope
that
wellington
might
follow
him
into
the
abandoning
his
defensive
system
and
consenting
to
give
battle
in
the
open
the
english
might
even
be
induced
to
attack
the
french
army
when
it
should
have
taken
up
a
new
and
a
strong
position
in
somewhat
rash
confidence
the
marshal
professed
himself
certain
of
the
result
even
with
his
depleted
army
of
under
men
if
wellington
would
consent
to
fight
at
the
worst
if
starved
out
again
or
beaten
in
the
field
he
would
retreat
on
spain
by
castello
branco
for
which
purpose
he
had
sent
up
the
greater
part
of
his
from
santarem
to
build
a
bridge
over
the
zezere
he
had
also
pushed
part
of
loison
s
brigade
of
infantry
across
that
river
at
punhete
and
was
holding
with
it
a
point
suitable
for
a

regiment
of
dragoons
was
attached
to
this
force
it
skirmished
not
unfrequently
with
parties
sent
out
to
reconnoitre
from
abrantes
but
with
no
serious
result
for
general
lobo
the
governor
had
no
intention
of
coming
out
with
a
large
detachment
in
order
to
push
the
french
advanced
guard
back
over
the
river
he
had
been
ordered
to
keep
to
the
defensive
and
only
sent
out
occasional
reconnaissances
to
see
whether
the
enemy
were
still
in
position
loison

troops
were
now
no
longer
the
only
large
force
which
had
quitted

of

lines
not
only
was
montbrun
with
the
main
body
of
the
cavalry
watching
the
roads
from
the
north
but
six
battalions
of
infantry
had
been
sent
up
from
the
corps
on
november
to
occupy
torres
novas
and
thomar
if
wellington
had
attacked
the
enemy
behind
sobral
on
any
day
after
that
date
he
would
have
found
ney
short
of
fourteen
battalions
out
of
the
which
formed
his
corps
there
would
have
been
only
infantry
ready
to
support
junot
in
the
direction
of
alemquer
but
this
fact
of
course
was
unknown
to
the
english
general
who
had
already
made
up
his
mind
not
to
take
the
offensive
if
it
had
come
to
his
knowledge
he
might
have
attacked
even
at
the
last
moment
with
an
enormous
probability
of
inflicting
on
the
enemy
not
the
mere
repulse
that
he
disliked
to
contemplate
on
account
of
its
ulterior
effects
but
a
crushing
defeat
which
might
have
hurled
them
out
of
portugal
viz
batts
and
batts
of
marchand
s
division
at
thomar
and
torres
novas
with
loison
s
batts
batts

it
will
be
remembered
that
reynier
was
at
the

time
minus
the

as
escort
with

to
ciudad
rodrigo
on
november
masséna
ordered
the
hospitals
of

of
the
corps
at
azambuja
to
be
sent
off
to

intendants
of

depleted

was
out

to
move
first
then
junot
and
ferey

whose
movement
was
most
perilous
for
if
their
departure
were
discovered
while
they
were
on
the
hither
side
of
the
defile
of
alemquer
they
ran
a
great
risk
of
being
enveloped
and
destroyed
reynier
was
to
maintain
his
position
at
villafranca
and
carregado
until
it
was
reported
to
him
that
junot
and
his
corps
had
passed

for
if
the
corps

gone
off
at
an
early
hour

its
departure
had
been
discovered
hill
might
have
marched
from
alhandra
on
alemquer
quickly
enough
to
intercept
junot

that
point
and
if
junot
were
being
pursued
at
the
moment
by
the
troops
from
his
immediate
front
the
whole
corps
might
have
been
cut
off
on
the
night
of
the
when
the
movement
was
commencing
masséna
was
favoured
with
the
greatest
piece
of
luck
which
had
come
to
him
since
the
explosion
of
almeida
a
fog
began
to
rise
in
the
small
hours
and
had
become
dense
by
the
early
morning
it
caused
some
difficulty
to
the
retiring
troops
and
dragoons
had
to
be
placed
at
every
cross
road
to
point
out
the
right
direction
to
the
infantry
columns
but
it
had
the
result
of
permitting
the
british
outposts
to
see
nothing
at
dawn
the
limit
visible
to
them
was
less
than
yards
it
was
only
at
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
of
the
that
the
mists
were
suddenly
rolled
up
by
an
east
wind
and
that
the
nearer
outposts
could
see
that
the
french
sentinels
in
front
of
them
had
disappeared
the
first
alarm
was
given
by
campbell
s
division
the
news
spread
along
the
whole
line
from
west
to
east
and
reached
the
who
ascended
the
hill
in
front
of
sobral
a
few
minutes
later
the
ingenuity
of
the
enemy
in
concealing
his
departure
had
been
great
ferey
s
brigade
in
front
of
arruda
had
erected
a
line
of
dummy
sentinels
before
the
light
division
which
were
not
discovered
to
be
men
of
straw
topped
with

in

the
day

and
most
difficult
stage

been
detected
as
he
was

have
been
visible
still
in
line
of

behind
villafranca
the
french
diarists
of
the
campaign
prefer
not
to
contemplate
yet
they
mostly
continued
to
speak
of
wellington
as
a
mediocre
general
who
had
all
the
luck
on
his
side
on
the
night
of
the
the
british
had
to
draw
his
deductions
from
the
facts
before
him
three
things
were
possible
masséna
might
have
been
so
thoroughly
starved
out
and
broken
in
spirit
that
he
might
be
intending
to
retire
on
spain
either
via
thomar
and
the
mondego
or
by
his
new
bridge
on
the
zezere
and
the
route
of
castello
branco
or
he
might
be
proposing
to
cross
the
tagus
by
means
of
the
boats
and
pontoons
still
remaining
at
santarem
to
seek
unwasted
fields
in
the
alemtejo
and
a
junction
with
mortier
or
again
he
might
merely
be
abandoning
a
position
that
was
no
longer
tenable
in
order
to
take
up
a
new
one
perhaps
at
santarem
perhaps
at
thomar
but
very
possibly
at
and
about
abrantes
whose
siege
he
might
be
contemplating
wellington
to
fane
the
enemy
retreated
last
night
he
intends
either
to
retire
across
the
zezere
into
spain
or
across
the
tagus
into
spain
or
across
the
zezere
to
attack
abrantes
the
last
is
possible
as
i
last
night
received
an
account
that
on
the
they
had
a
considerable
reinforcement
coming
on
the
frontier
at
beira
on
the
whole
wellington
thought
it
probable
that
the
plan
was
the
one
which
masséna
intended
to
adopt
a
retreat
on
spain
would
not
only
be
difficult
and
dangerous
but
inconsistent
with
the
marshal
s
obstinate
and
courageous
temper
it
was
much
more
likely
that
he
would
endeavour
to
hold
out
in
portugal
and
meanwhile
to
cover
his
partial
discomfiture
by
a
bold
stroke
such
as
the
siege
of
abrantes
which
would
still
give
an
offensive
air
to
his
movements
and
would
also
throw
on
the
british
army
the
responsibility
of
relieving
the
fortress
such
a
course
it
will
be
remembered
was
what
napoleon
recommended
to
foy
there
is
still
a
chance
that
the
enemy
may
take
up
and
try
to
keep
a
position
at
santarem
wrote
wellington
to
fane
on
the
night
of
the
endeavouring
to
keep
his
rear
open
and
to
get
a
communication
with
ciudad
rodrigo
across
the
but
he
was
inclined
to
think
that
abrantes
was
masséna
s
goal
he
therefore
directed
fane
to
transfer
his
cavalry
to
the
point
opposite
abrantes
on
the
south
bank
of
the
tagus
and
requested
carlos
d
españa
to
enter
the
place
and
strengthen
the
garrison
he
intended
to
pass
over
hill
s
two
divisions
to
strengthen
fane
and
for
that
purpose
directed
admiral
berkeley
to
prepare
all
the
boats
of
the
fleet
to
ferry
hill
across
to
salvaterra
on
the
south
bank
of
the
tagus
from
whence
his
force
could
join
fane
and
either
reinforce
abrantes
by
means
of
its
bridge
of
boats
or
join
in
the
pursuit
of
masséna
if
he
were
about
an
unlikely
chance
to
retire
on
spain
by
way
of
his
bridge
over
the
zezere
and
castello
branco
see
above
all
from
the
orders
issued
at
in
the
morning
from
the
hill
in
front
of
sobral
vi
meanwhile
all
was
still
uncertain
and
it
was
wellington
s
first
task
to
find
out
what
roads
the
enemy
had
taken
in
his
retreat
he
did
not
on
the
order
his
whole
army
to
leave
the
lines
in
headlong
pursuit
only
spencer
craufurd
and
hill
were
directed
to
march
that
afternoon
the
former
with
a
cavalry
regiment
out
in
his
front
occupied
sobral
and
pushed
its
vanguard
forward
to
alemquer

the
high
road

second
left
arruda
climbed
the
low
hills
in
front
of
him
where
ferey
had
been
encamped
for
the
last
month
and
felt
his
way
to
alemquer
by
the
bad
road
which
his
immediate
adversary
had
taken
eighteen
hours
before
hill
followed
the
great
along
the
tagus
bank
by
villafranca
and
castanheira
and
reached
carregado
before
dark
he
was
warned
to
be
in
readiness
to
cross
the
river
by
means
of
admiral
berkeley
s
boats
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
in
case
the
french
should
have
built
a
bridge
at
santarem
to
enable
them
to
cross
into

alemtejo

orders
issued
at
in
the
morning
from

advancing
troops
found
the
french
camps
and
the
villages
where
the
more
fortunate
battalions
had
been
quartered
under
cover

the
most
dreadful
condition

alemquer

was
covered
with
horses

had
perished
from

passed

dead

and
want
of
food

carried
them
off

thoroughly
ransacked

burnt

well
as

dashed
to
pieces
with
the
objectless
fury
of
savages
they
had
left
many
miserable
fellows
behind
who
were
too
ill
to
march
these
were
of
course
put
to
death
by
the
portuguese
whenever
we
happened
to
miss
finding
them
out
we
found
several
peasants
whom
the
french
had
murdered
and
left
upon
the
road
and
also
several
french
killed
by
the
portuguese
it
was
a
dreadful
sight
to
see
so
many
fine
towns
and
villages
sacked
and
without
a

cut
up

captured

some
of
the
frenchmen
had
got
to
their
muskets

wounded

of
his
troopers

on

afternoon
of
the
the
enemy
s
rearguard
was
at
last
discovered
drawn
up
on
a
heath
outside
the
village
of
cartaxo
it
consisted
of
one
of
reynier
s
divisions
which
craufurd
was
preparing
to
attack
when
the
came
up
and
refused
him
leave
to
begin
the
combat
because
neither
hill
nor
spencer
was
within
supporting
distance
of
him
opinions
differed
as
to
whether
an
attack
would
have
led
to
a
repulse
by
superior
numbers
or
to
the
capture
of
the
french
division
which
had
a
bridge
and
a
long
causeway
a
most
dangerous
defile
in
its
rear
probably
craufurd
was
not
in
quite
sufficient
strength
to
be
certain
of
success
he
had
but
six
strong
battalions
a
battery
and
the
light
dragoons
in
his
company
the
enemy
had
the
eleven
weak
battalions
of
merle
s
division
and
two
regiments
of
cavalry
probably
bayonets
and
sabres
in
all
more
than
craufurd
could
command
but
an
attack
made
with
vigour
when
half
the
french
had
begun
to
retire
across
the
defile
might
have
had
considerable
results
merle
s
division
was
however
allowed
to
retire
unmolested
in
the
evening
while
the
light
division
took
up
quarters
for
the
night
at
cartaxo
reynier
drew
back
the
whole
of
his
corps
next
morning
to
the
environs
of
santarem
which
he
had
been
directed
to
defend
meanwhile
the
corps
had
reached
pernes
with
one
division
and
alcanhede
with
the
other
and
its
cavalry
these
were
the
points
at
which
junot
had
been
ordered
to
stay
his
retreat
the
bulk
of
the
corps
was
at
thomar
but
loison
s
division
had
been
kept
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
zezere
and
part
of
marchand
s
infantry
and
ney
s
were
at
cabaços
the
retreat
was
thus
ended
for
masséna
was
in
possession
of
the
new
ground
on
which
he
intended
to
maintain
himself
for
the
winter
and
he
was
prepared
to
accept
a
defensive
battle
if
wellington
should
push
him
any
further
his
left
flank
near
the
tagus
reynier
s
corps
was
advanced
his
right
flank
junot
s
corps
much
ney
was
forming

central
reserve
leach
thinks
with
william
napier
iii
that
wellington
acted
wisely
in
refusing
craufurd
leave
to
attack
tomkinson
another
thinks
that
an
opportunity
was
missed
pp
having
now
received
the
brunswick
oels
jägers
the
light
division
was
six
battalions
strong
not
its
usual
five
its
strength
about
this
time
was
some
bayonets
merle
s
division
was
about
strong
it
had
dwindled
to
effectives
before
december
was
out
thus
the
english
and
caçadore
battalions
averaged
men
the
french
only
so
that
the
strength
was
not
very
unequal
but
only
of
craufurd
s
troops
were
british
there
its
main
body
was
now
joined
by
ferey
s
brigade
which
had
been
detached
for
some
weeks
unfortunately
for
himself
the
british
received
on
the
night
of
the
confusing
intelligence
which
led
him
to
the
false
conclusion
that
the
enemy
was
still
retiring
and
was
aiming
either
for
abrantes
or
for
the
borders
of
spain
this
news
was
sent
by
fane
who
from
the
other
bank
of
the
tagus
had
observed
french
columns
and
convoys
marching
eastward
from
santarem
towards
the
zezere
and
wrongly
inferred
that
the
main
army
was
making
for
this
direction
and
that
only
a
rearguard
had
been
left
in
santarem
he
was
also
influenced
by
the
fact
reported
from
abrantes
that
masséna
had
cast
a
second
bridge
over
the
zezere
near
punhete
as
if
to
give
him
a
quicker
chance
of
passing
that
river
in
consequence
of
this
news
wellington
directed
hill
to
cross
the
tagus
at
vallada
with
his
own
division
hamilton
s
portuguese
and
the
light
dragoons
in
order
to
strengthen
abrantes
if
it
were
assailed
or
to
fall
on
the
flank
of
the
french
if
they
were
merely
passing
that
fortress
on
their
retreat
to
spain
thus
he
deprived
himself
of
men
on
the
right
bank
of
the
tagus
where
alone
troops
were
really
needed
to
make
up
for
hill
s
absence
leith
s
and
cole
s
divisions
were
called
out
of
the
lines
where
they
had
rested
till
this
moment
november
but
they
were
two
marches
off
and
wellington
had
for
the
moment
in
his
front
line
only
craufurd
spencer
pack
s
portuguese
and
slade
s
and
anson
s

a
force
of
some

reynier
was
in
his
immediate
front
at
santarem
with
men
of
all
arms
junot
s
corps
at
alcanhede
and
pernes
was
twelve
miles
away
and
about
strong
the
greater
part
of
his
men
could
have
been
brought
up
in
half
a
day

was
too
distant
to
come
up
in
less
than
hours
and
then
only
with
half
his
corps
as
loison
and
one
of
marchand
s
brigades
were
far
away
but
if
wellington
had
attacked
santarem
on
the
the
duke
of
elchingen
would
have
appeared
next
morning
probably
ferey
s
brigade
marching
to
join
loison
and
trains
following
it
and
certainly
reynier
s
trains
which
he
had
sent
off
towards

assistant

the
date
for
leith
s
start
on
the
same
morning
see
s
craufurd
was
as
strongly
convinced
as
his
chief
that
there
was
nothing
in
front
of
him
but
a
rearguard
on
the
night
of
the
and
he
even
doubted
whether
the
last
of
the
french
would
not
withdraw
at
midnight
it
was
this
that
induced
him
to
make
the
curious
personal
exploration
mentioned
by
napier
iii
when
followed
by
a
single
sergeant
only
he
pushed
along
the
causeway
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
ran
into
the
french
picket
and
escaped
as
if
by
miracle
the
volley
that
was
fired
at
him
the
picket
reported
to
reynier
that
they
had
been
seriously
attacked
had
killed
three
of
their
assailants
and
had
heard
the
groans
of
wounded
dragged
away
by
the
survivors

and
his
sergeant
retired
thoroughly
convinced
that
the
causeway
had
not
been
evacuated

however
dates
the
general
s
escapade
wrongly
it
took
place
on
the
night
of
the
where
it
is
duly
related
in
the
diary
of
george
simmons
and
not
on
the
as
napier
implies
i
have
a
copy
of
delagrave
s
de
which
once
belonged
to
napier
he
has
written
a
sarcastic
note
on
the
bottom
of
page
commenting
on
the
ridiculous
account
of
the
event
which
appeared
in
the
french
narratives
he
adds
that
the
sergeant
s
name
was
mccurry
and
that
the
sergeant
had
sense
enough
to
hold
his
tongue
but
craufurd
spoke
out
and
so
drew
the
fire
of
the
enemy
s
it
was
undoubtedly
fortunate
for
the
british
that
his
habitual
caution
prevented
him
from
making
a
serious
attack
on
the
force
at
santarem
under
the
impression
that
it
was
a
mere
rearguard
left
behind
to
detain
him
while
the
enemy
s
main
body
was
pushing
for
abrantes
reynier
s
position
was
very
formidable
the
town
of
santarem
surrounded
by
an
old
mediaeval
wall
stands
on
a
lofty
height
above
the
tagus
with
a
narrow
suburb
where
the
french
dockyard
had
been
established
along
the
lower
edge
of
the
hill
but
this
was
only
the
third
and
last
line
of
the
defensive
position
in
front
of
it
lay
low
alluvial
ground
inundated
by
the
rain
which
had
been
falling
during
the
last
fortnight
and
barely
passable
save
by
the
from
lisbon
the
plain
was
cut
in
two
by
the
rio
mayor
a
deep
muddy
stream
at
this
time
of
the
year
and
to
reach
santarem
a
narrow
bridge
over
this
obstacle
had
to
be
passed
just
where
the
leaves
the
marsh
to
climb
towards
the
town
was
a
long
knoll
completely
commanding
the
road
on
this
reynier
had
placed
a
battery
with
infantry
supports
this
force
must
be
driven
in
by
the
british
and
the
only
practicable
way
to
reach
it
was
by
forcing
a
passage
along
the
causeway
for
the
marsh
between
the
road
and
the
tagus
turned
out
when
explored
to
be
practically
inaccessible
to
formed
troops
though
individuals
might
wade
through
it
in
a
few
places
behind
the
advanced
french
knoll
were
the
of
the
lofty
ridge
on
which
santarem
lies
the
enemy
were
visible
upon
it
working
hard
at
the
construction
of
a
line
of
from
the
which
cover
its
slopes
behind
this
again
was
the
town
itself
hastily
prepared
for
defence
on
the
morning
of
november
the
british
advanced
guard
was
on
the
edge
of
the
swampy
plain
craufurd
s
light
division
occupied
the
near
end
of
the
long
bridge
over
the
rio
mayor
and
skirmished
with
the
french
outposts
who
refused
to
retire
from
the
further
side
spencer
came
up
more
to
the
left
and
further
inland
pack
s
portuguese
reached
the
upper
course
of
the
rio
mayor
neither
leith
nor
cole
had
yet
arrived
at
the
front
so
that
the
force
available
for
an
attack
was
no
more
than
men
nevertheless
wellington
still
hoping
that
he
had
only
a
rearguard
in
front
of
him
made
dispositions
for
a
demonstration
against
the
enemy
s
front
which
was
to
be
turned
into
a
real
attack
if
he
showed
want
of
strength
craufurd
was
directed
to
advance
across
the
swamp
near
the
tagus
if
he
found
it
practicable
pack
was
to
cross
the
upper
rio
mayor
and
turn
the
hostile
right
spencer
was
formed
at
the
entrance
of
the
bridge
and
causeway
and
ordered
to
charge
up
the
at
the
french
centre
and
the
battery
commanding
the
road
so
soon
as
he
should
see
that
the
flanking
divisions
were
making
good
progress
fortunately
for
wellington
the
attack
was
never
delivered
more
rain
during
the
night
had
made
the
marsh
so
waterlogged
that
craufurd
who
had
crossed
the
rio
mayor
by
a
narrow
wooden
bridge
near
valle
came
to
a
stand
in
the
slush
though
a
few
of
his
skirmishers
pushed
far
enough
forward
to
engage
the
enemy
s
pickets
on
the
other
side
pack
s
portuguese
on
the
left
flank
got
across
the
river
with
much
difficulty
but
their
guns
were
absolutely
stuck
in
the
mud
far
to
the
rear
and
the
brigadier
sent
back
word
to
wellington
that
he
should
advance
no
further
without
special
orders
the
division
had
not
yet
begun
to
move
thereupon
the
called
back
both
craufurd
and
pack
and
gave
up
his
plan
it
is
clear
that
he
had
nourished
some
intention
of
attacking
in
earnest
for
he
wrote
to
hill
that
afternoon
i
did
not
attack
santarem
this
morning
as
the
artillery
of
the
left
wing
pack
had
lost
its
way
and
i
am
rather
glad
that
i
did
not
attack
as
the
enemy
have
there
undoubtedly
a
very
strong
post
and
we
must
endeavour
to
turn
it
and
if
they
the
main
body
have
not
retired
across
the
zezere
or
towards
the
alva
they
must
be
too
strong
for
us
it
is
obvious
that
both
wellington
s
and
masséna
s
strategy
on
the
and
november
is
exposed
to
criticism
why
had
the
british
general
only
men
to
the
front
on
these
days
when
he
was
risking
a
general
action
with
the
french
one
of
two
courses
must
have
been
adopted
by
the
enemy
either
he
must
be
marching
hard
for
the
zezere
and
intending
to
retire
into
spain
or
he
must
be
merely
changing
his
ground
and
proposing
to
fight
at
santarem
or
in
front
of
abrantes
or
elsewhere
in
either
case
it
was
strange
tactics
for
wellington
to
take
the
field
with
men
deducting
hill
on
the
other
side
of
the
tagus
while
he
left
leith
and
cole
two
or
three
marches
behind
and
still
kept
the
divisions
of
picton
campbell
and
le
cor
and
the
unattached
portuguese
brigade
of
coleman
and
alex
campbell
men
unmoved
within
the
lines
for
if
the
enemy
was
flying
there
was
no
need
to
leave
such
a
force
of
regulars
to
guard
positions
which
the
french
could
not
be
intending
to
attack
while
if
the
other
hypothesis
was
correct
and
masséna
with
an
army
which
wellington
still
reckoned
at
men
was
in
a
fighting
mood
and
ready
to
give
battle
if
he
saw
an
advantageous
opportunity
it
was
still
more
inexcusable
to
leave
behind
men
who
would
be
wanted
for
the
decisive
struggle
on
the
other
hand
the
french
marshal
was
taking
a
terrible
risk
also
supposing
wellington
had
been
leading
his
whole
force
deducting
hill
for
a
resolute
attack
on
the
santarem
positions
which
was
the
most
probable
course
for
him
to
adopt
he
might
have
had
not
only
the
men
that
he
had
actually
brought
forward
but
leith
and
cole
with
more
and
picton
and
the
other
men
left
in
the
lines
a
force
if
the
cavalry
be
thrown
in
of
full
sabres
and
bayonets
if
wellington
had
left
craufurd
and
pack
to
block
the
marshy
southern
exit
from
santarem
which
was
as
difficult
for
reynier
as
for
his
adversaries
he
might
have
thrown
men
into
the
empty
space
of
twelve
miles
between
reynier
and
junot
have
driven
away
the
latter
s
men
and
surrounded
reynier

santarem
ney
could
not
have
got
up

the

either
have
had
to
surrender

it

hardly
any
food
or
to
cut
its
way

disastrous
losses

saw
this
perfectly
and
was
in
an
agony
of
mind
on
the
and
he
wrote
urgent
appeals
to
masséna
for
permission
to
abandon
santarem
on
the
former
day
pointing
out
that
if
his
front
was
practically
inaccessible
because
of
the
swamps
his
right
might
be
turned
by
the
upper
rio
mayor
where
he
had
only
a
single
regiment
in
observation
to
face
what
might
be
an
overwhelming
strength
of
british
troops
who
might
be
preparing
to
cut
in
between
him
and
junot
he
sent
all
his
train
sick
and
wounded
to
golegão
and
besought
leave
to
follow
them
when
he
received
a
peremptory
reply
to
the
effect
that
he
was
to
hold
santarem
to
the
last
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
to
be
sacrificed
in
order
to
allow
the
other
two
corps
to
escape
unmolested
when
pack
advanced
on
the
he
sent
the
report
that
he
was
turned
by
british
troops
pack
had
but
portuguese
and
that
clausel
with
junot
s
nearest
division
was
too
far
off
to
succour
him
he
prepared
to
suffer
a
disaster
and
to
die
fighting
he
ordered
his
troops
to
surround
santarem
in
rear
as
well
as
in
front
with
a
double
line
of
and
continued
to
strengthen
and
repair
its
old
walls
it
was
their
march
visible
from
the
other
side
of
the
tagus
which
helped
to
deceive
fane
as
to
the
general
movements
of
the
french
army
see
delagrave
and
gachot
s
excellent
notes
thereon
nothing
therefore
could
exceed
reynier
s
relief
when
pack
and
craufurd
halted
and
spencer
did
not
move
at
all
after
the
firing
had
begun
upon
the
on
the
next
morning
the
british
army
was
still
stationary
save
that
a
cavalry
reconnaissance
pushed
northward
from
pack
s
position
on
the
upper
rio
mayor
discovered
junot
s
outposts
in
the
direction
of
alcanhede
and
pernes
and
reported
to
wellington
that
the
enemy
was
in
strength
with
all
arms
in
this
direction
leith
s
division
came
up
this
morning
raising
the
british
force
to
men
but
this
as
the
now
saw
was
not
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
deal
with
two
corps
d
armée
of
which
one
was
in
an
inaccessible
position
and
now
stockaded
up
to
the
eyes
he
halted
and
sent
very
tardily
orders
for
cole
to
join
in
haste
and
for
campbell
s
division
to
come
up
from
the
lines
but
even
thus
he
was
too
weak
to
strike
hill
was
now
at
almeirim
half
way
to
abrantes
on
the
other
side
of
the
tagus
fane
had
actually
entered
abrantes
and
sent
news
that
the
enemy
was
making
no
forward
movement
from
the
zezere
thus
at
last
wellington
discovered
that
he
must
have
practically
the
whole
french
army
in
his
front
while
his
own
forces
were
in
a
state
of
terrible
dispersion
on
the
he
wrote
a
dispatch
to
lord
liverpool
which
shows
that
he
had
given
up
all
intention
of
pushing
masséna
further
although
the
enemy
have
moved
large
bodies
of
troops
eastward
from
santarem
i
have
not
heard
that
any
large
body
has
crossed
the
zezere
their
army
being
collected
between
santarem
and
the
zezere
they
are
in
a
situation
to
be
able
to
maintain
themselves
in
their
strong
position
till
the
reinforcements
which
i
know
are
on
the
frontier
can
join
them
for
this
reason
and
because
i
am
unwilling
to
expose
to
the
inclemencies
of
the
weather
a
larger
body
of
troops
than
is
absolutely
necessary
to
press
upon
the
enemy
s
rear
and
to
support
my
advanced
guard
i
have
kept
in
reserve
a
considerable
proportion
of
the
allied
army
some
of
them
still
in
their
cantonments
in
the
lines
our
fortified
position
i
have
ordered
general
hill
to
halt
the
head
of
his
corps
at
chamusca
on
the
other
side
of
the
tagus
fifteen
miles
south
of
abrantes
till
the
enemy
s
movements
have
been
decided
the
rain
which
has
been
very
heavy
since
the
has
so
completely
filled
the
rivulets
and
destroyed
the
roads
that
i
have
hitherto
found
it
impossible
to
dislodge
the
enemy
from
his
position
at
santarem
by
movements
through
the
hills
on
his
right
flank
possibly
the
bad
state
of
the
roads
has
also
been
the
cause
of
his
remaining
at
santarem
so
long
the
enemy
s
army
may
be
reinforced
and
they
may
again
induce
me
to
think
it
expedient
in
the
existing
state
of
affairs
in
the
peninsula
to
resume
my
positions
the
lines
but
i
do
not
believe
that
they
have
it
in
their
power
to
bring
such
a
force
against
us
as
to
render
the
contest
a
matter
of
doubt
wellington
to
liverpool
in
a
supplementary
dispatch
dated
the
same
day
wellington
adds
at
first
i
thought
the
enemy
were
off
and
i
am
not
quite
certain
yet
that
they
are
not
going
i
am
convinced
that
there
is
no
man
in
his
senses
who
has
ever
passed
a
winter
in
portugal
who
would
not
recommend
them
to
go
now
rather
than
to
endeavour
to
maintain
themselves
upon
the
zezere
during
the
winter
or
than
attack
our
position
whatever
may
be
the
strength
of
their
there
were
indeed
men
in
the
french
camp
who
advised
masséna
to
continue
his
retreat
but
he
had
no
intention
of
taking
up
a
timid
policy
after
braving
so
many
passed
dangers
he
had
resolved
to
maintain
himself
between
santarem
and
the
zezere
and
to
call
down
drouet
and
other
reinforcements
in
the
hope
that
ere
the
winter
was
over
the
emperor
might
find
means
to
strengthen
him
to
a
force
which
with
the
of
soult
from
andalusia
would
enable
him
finally
to
resume
the
offensive
and
make
a
second
and
more
formidable
attack
upon
the
lines
in
adopting
this
resolve
he
was
though
as
yet
he
knew
it
not
carrying
out
the
instructions
which
the
emperor
was
at
this
very
moment
november
dictating
to
foy
at
paris
but
wellington
had
not
written
at
random
when
he
reminded
lord
liverpool
of
the
terrors
of
a
portuguese
winter
and
in
the
end
the
prince
of
essling
was
forced
to
begin
on
the
of
march
with
under
men
of
his
original
force
the
retreat
which
he
might
have
commenced
on
november
with
over
notably
the
column
of
gardanne
of
which
we
shall
speak
presently
including
sick
in
each
case
and
excluding
reinforcements
received
later
the
scheme
for
starving
out
the
french
which
wellington
had
devised
early
in
and
begun
to
execute
in
september
was
now
transferred
to
a
different
area
masséna
had
been
able
to
endure
for
a
month
in
front
of
the
lisbon
lines
the
question
now
was
whether
he
would
be
able
to
live
so
long
in
the
land
between
the
rio
mayor
and
the
zezere
wellington
could
not
be
sure
of
his
data
in
calculating
the
day
when
exhaustion
would
once
more
compel
the
french
to
shift
their
ground
it
was
only
certain
that
the
plain
of
golegão
and
the
novas
country
had
not
been
devastated
by
the
portuguese
government
even
with
the
same
energy
that
they
had
displayed
in
the
lisbon
peninsula
and
there
as
the
british
complained
not
half
the
necessary
work
had
been
done
yet
something
had
certainly
been
accomplished
the
population
had
nearly
all
been
withdrawn
the
mills
destroyed
the
corn
buried
or
sent
over
the
tagus
trusting
to
these
facts
and
to
the
rains
and
frosts
of
the
oncoming
winter
wellington
hoped
that
masséna
would
finally
be
reduced
to
a
disastrous
retreat
by
sheer
privation
though
it
is
certainly
astonishing
that
the
enemy
have
been
able
to
remain
in
this
country
so
long
and
it
is
an
extraordinary
instance
of
what
a
french
army
can
do
vii
resolved
to
take
no
further
offensive
action
and
to
let
famine
do
its
work
wellington
on
november
gave
orders
for
the
army
to
draw
back
and
go
into
winter
quarters
leaving

d

s
under

on
the

hand
also
remained
nearly
quiescent
for
many
days
the
only
important
change
which
he
made
in
the
cantonments
of
his
army
being
that
he
moved
in
clausel
s
division
closer
to
santarem
to
fill
the
dangerous
gap
between
the
and
corps
which
had
existed
on
november
on
the
and
he
pushed
forward
against
pack
s
portuguese
and
anson
s
light
cavalry
a
considerable
force
consisting
of
clausel
s
whole
division
and
six
squadrons
from
the
corps
and
general
pierre
soult
with
two
cavalry
regiments
and
three
battalions
from
the
corps
after
some
lively
but
bloodless
skirmishing
the
allied
troops
retired
behind
the
rio
mayor
evacuating
the
village
of
calares
beyond
the
stream
and
drawing
in
their
cavalry
pickets
which
had
hitherto
held
some
ground
on
the
further
bank
this
affair
confirmed
wellington
in
his
conclusion
that
nearly
the
whole
french
army
was
now
concentrated
on
the
line
and
made
him
more
reluctant
than
ever
to
take
the
offensive
meanwhile
montbrun
s
cavalry
supported
by
small
detachments
from
the
infantry
of
ney
s
corps
had
pressed
somewhat
further
to
the
north
in
order
to
occupy
a
broader
tract
of
land
from
which
the
army
might
feed
itself
a
task
that
grew
harder
every
day
from
his
head
quarters
at
ourem
and
from
cabaços
on
the
road
he
continued
to
send
out
strong
reconnaissances
in
every
direction
of
which
some
occasionally
pushed
as
far
as
leiria
on
the
road
towards
coimbra
and
others
scoured
the
left
bank
of
the
lower
zezere
and
the
nabao
the
limit
of
their
excursions
was
fixed
by
the
fact
that
wilson
s
brigade
of
portuguese
militia
still
lay
at
espinhal
and
though
it
was
reduced
by
desertion
and
sickness
to
men
was
reported
to
montbrun
as
a
serious
force
with
which
he
had
better
not
meddle
trant
s
troops
at
coimbra
a
weak
militia
division
were
also
estimated
at
much
over
their
real
strength
it
was
not
till
later
that
sheer
starvation
drove
the
french
further
afield
and
revealed
to
them
the
weakness
of
the
of
inferior
troops
which
hemmed
them
in
upon
the
northern
side
the
blockade
of
the
french
army
therefore
remained
still
unbroken
and
its
communication
with
the
north
was
as
absolutely
interrupted
in
the
end
of
november
as
in
the
beginning
of
october
one
attempt
to
break
through
the
screen
of
portuguese
irregulars
had
been
made
in
november
but
of
its
failure
masséna
had
as
yet
no
knowledge
when
foy
reached
rodrigo
on
his
way
to
paris
he
had
handed
over
his
escort
of
one
battalion
of
infantry
and
horsemen
to
general
gardanne
who
was
ordered
to
strengthen
them
with
all
the
convalescents
of
the
army
of
portugal
and
with
the
garrisons
of
almeida
and
rodrigo
also
if
these
last
had
now
been
relieved
by
troops
of
drouet
s
corps
at
the
head
of
men
as
masséna
calculated
he
could
cut
his
way
to
join
the
main
army
escorting
a
great
train
of
munitions
of
which
both
the
artillery
and
the
infantry
at
the
front
were
lamentably
in
need
gardanne
could
not
gather
in
the
almeida
garrison
as
that
place
was
still
blockaded
by
silveira
s
portuguese
but
with
the
two
battalions
from
rodrigo
added
to
foy
s
late
escort
and
a
mass
of
convalescents
he
had
collected
some
men
by
november
the
day
on
which
he
marched
by
the
route
towards
punhete
and
the
lower
zezere
he
was
cursed
with
dreadful
weather
followed
and
harassed
by
all
the
ordenança
of
the
castello
branco
country
hampered
by
his
heavy
convoy
and
much
troubled
by
the
disorderly
convalescents
who
were
largely
professional
malingerers
but
he
got
as
far
as
cardigos
on
the
road
only
fifteen
miles
from
punhete
where
loison
was
awaiting
him
on
the
zezere
here
he
was
brought
to
a
stand
november
by
the
flooded
and
bridgeless
stream
of
the
codes
no
news
had
reached
him
from
masséna
while
he
was
assured
by
portuguese
deserters
who
probably
were
sent
out
to
deceive
him
by
the
governor
of
abrantes
that
the
marshal
had
not
only
evacuated
his
position
before
the
lines
but
was
retreating
on
spain
via
the
mondego
they
added
that
hill
had
just
reached
abrantes
with
men
and
was
about
to
march
against
him
thereupon
gardanne
hastily
turned
back
reached
penamacor
by
forced
marches
on
november
and
from
thence
retired
to
rodrigo
having
lost
men
and
horses
by
disease
and
fatigue
during
his
expedition
if
he
had
pushed
forward
fifteen
miles
further
on
the
he
would
have
got
into
touch
with
loison
and
reached
masséna
s
head
quarters
in
safety
wellington
not
without
reason
professed
himself
unable
to
comprehend
this
strange
march
and
countermarch
i
do
not
exactly
understand
this
movement
and
if
this
march
was
ordered
by
superior
authority
and
was
connected
with
any
other
arrangements
it
had
every
appearance
of
and
was
attended
by
all
the
consequences
of
a
precipitate
and
forced
retreat

it
to

that
despite
many
dangers
and
risks
wellington
s
scheme
of
starvation
was
played
out
to
the
end
and
achieved
complete
success

the

that

french
suffered

atrocities

they

an
influence
extending

beyond
the
months
in

they
began
and
were
indeed
main
factors
in
the
peninsular
struggle
for
years
to

the
doings
of
the
armies
in
galicia
and
asturias
on
the
one
flank
in
catalonia
and
valencia
on
the
other
can
easily
be
dismissed
in
a
few
pages
they
were
but
preliminaries
to
the
greater
operations
in
the
spring
of
we
may
first
turn
to
the
when
masséna
plunged
into
portugal
in
september
and
was
lost
to
the
sight
of
his
colleagues
and
subordinates
for
nearly
three
months
the
situation
left
behind
him
was
as
follows
leon
and
old
castile
as
far
as
the
galician
and
the
cantabrian
sierras
were
held
down
by
serras
and
kellermann
with
some
men
a
force
none
too
great
for
the
task
that
lay
before
them
the
latter
general
had
charge
of
the
provinces
of
valladolid
toro
and
palencia
as
one
of
the
military
governors
recently
appointed
by
the
emperor
he
gave
himself
absurd
airs
of
independent
authority
and
took
little
more
heed
of
the
orders
of
masséna
than
of
those
of
king
joseph
for
whom
he
showed
a
supreme
contempt
general
serras
s
troops
were
more
definitely
part
of
the
army
of
portugal
they
were
in
charge
of
the
provinces
of
zamora
leon
and
salamanca
thus
covering
kellermann
s
government
on
the
outer
flank
and
taking
care
of
the
borders
both
of
galicia
on
the
spanish
and
of
on
the
portuguese
side
to
cover
this
long
front
serras
had
only
eleven
battalions
and
two
provisional

out
of
this
force
he
had
to
find
garrisons
for

leon
benavente

and
several
smaller
places
kellermann
who
was
intended
to
serve
as
a
reserve
for
serras
as
well
as
to
guard
the
central
dépôts
at

had

added

to
the

of

if
the

were
left
rather
weak
in

direction
the

at

between

less
than

what
had
his
enemies
to
oppose
to
this
formidable
host
whose
strength
was
considerably
greater
than
that
of
the
force
with
which
masséna
invaded
portugal
of
regularly
organized
troops
the
number
of
spaniards
and
portuguese
opposed
to
them
was
absolutely
insignificant

six
regiments
of

of

last
being
the
the
absconding
garrison
of

the
whole
made
under
men
including
an
incomplete
cavalry
regiment

in

had
recruited
up
the
depleted
divisions
which
la
romana
had
left
with
him
in
the
spring
to
a
strength
of
men
mostly
raw
and
untrustworthy
for
the
best

had
been
destroyed
at
the
siege
of
astorga
the
remains
of
the
army
of
asturias
which
had
suffered
so
many
defeats
at
the
hands
of
bonnet
during
the
spring
and
summer
consisted
of
about
men
of
whom
half
under
barcena
and
losada
were
holding
the
western
end
of
the
province
behind
the
navia
river
with
head
quarters
at
castropol
while
the
rest
lurked
in
the
higher
valleys
of
the
cantabrian
sierra
rendering
bonnet
s
communication
with
serras
in
leon
insecure
and
sometimes
descending
to
the
coast
to
make
a
sudden
attack
on
one
of
the
small
garrisons
which
linked
the
french
garrison
in
oviedo
with
that
at
santander
of
these
roving
bands
the
chief
leader
was
the
adventurous
porlier
the
as
the
asturians
called
him
who
won
a
reputation
for
his
perseverance
and
courage
the
men
of
silveira
mahy
and
the
asturian
army
were
the
only
regular
troops
opposed
to
the
french
in
northern
spain
how
came
it
then
that
the
enemy
was
held
in
check
and
never
succeeded
in
pushing
on
to
the
support
of
masséna
any
force
save
the
two
divisions
of
drouet
the
answer
is
simple
the
french
garrisons
were
fixed
down
to
their
positions
partly
because
of
napoleon
s
entire
lack
of
naval
power
partly
because
of
the
unceasing
activity
of
the
guerrilleros
who
were
far
more
busy
in
than
at
any
preceding
time
as
to
the
cause
it
may
be
said
that
the
french
in
asturias
santander
and
biscay
were
paralysed
by
the
existence
of
a
small
squadron
based
on
corunna
and
ferrol
as
long
as
this
existed
every
small
port
along
the
whole
northern
coast
of
spain
had
to
be
garrisoned
under
penalty
of
a
possible
descent
from
the
sea
which
might
cut
the
road
from
oviedo
to
san
sebastian
at
any
one
of
a
hundred
points
and
provide
arms
and
stores
for
the
guerrilla
bands
of
the
mountains
many
such
expeditions
were
carried
out
with
more
or
less
success
in
the
first
and
most
prosperous
of
them
took
place
in
july
when
porlier
putting
his
free
corps
of
some
men
on
transports
and
convoyed
by
the
british
commodore
mends
with
a
couple
of
frigates
came
ashore
near
the
important
harbour
of
santona
drove
out
the
small
garrison
and
then
coasted
along
in
the
direction
of
biscay
destroying
and
capturing
as
many
as
men
at
one
point
and
another
of
the
peasantry
of
the
coast
some
enlisted
in
porlier
s
band
others
took
to
the
hills
on
their
own
account
when
they
had
been
furnished
with
muskets
from
the
ships
the
marquesito
repeated
his
raid
in
august
but
this
time
stopped
on
shore
and
put
himself
at
the
head
of
the
local
insurgents
who
made
so
strong
a
head
in
the
country
about
potes
and
the
upper
pisuerga
that
serras
marched
against
him
with
almost
the
whole
of
his
division
and
spent
september
in
hunting
him
along
the
sides
of
the
sierras
but
though
aided
by
troops
lent
by
bonnet
and
by
detachments
from
burgos
the
french
general
could
never
catch
the
adroit
partisan
who
when
too
hard
pressed
returned

with
the
exploits
of

the
cadiz
regency
resolved
to
keep
up
the
game

sent
up
to
corunna
colonel
renovales
the
officer
who
had
for
so
long
made
head
against
suchet
in
the
mountains
of
aragon
he
was
authorized
to
requisition
a
brigade
from
mahy

army

the
more
seaworthy
ships
from
the
arsenal
of
ferrol
applications
for
naval
assistance
had
also
been
made
to
the
british
admiralty
and
sir
home
popham
came
with
four
frigates
and
a
battalion
of
marines
to
assist
in
a
systematic
raid
along
the
coasts
of
asturias
and
biscay
the
joint
expedition
started
from
corunna
on
october
with
a
landing
force
of
spanish
and
british
bayonets
on
board
on
the
it
drew
in
to
land
near
the
important
harbour
of
gijon
where
bonnet
kept
a
force
of
men
who
depended
for
their
succour
on
the
main
body
of
his
division
at
oviedo
but
the
french
general
chanced
to
be
hunting
porlier
further
to
the
east
and
had
left
the
asturian
capital
almost
ungarrisoned
hence
when
porlier
unexpectedly
appeared
before
gijon
on
the
inland
side
having
eluded
his
pursuer
and
the
ships
threw
the
landing
force
ashore
the
french
battalion
had
to
fly
several
ships
both
privateers
and
merchantmen
with
a
considerable
amount
of
military
stores
fell
into
the
hands
of
porlier
and
renovales
this
exploit
drew
down
on
them
the
whole
french
force
in
the
asturias
for
bonnet
concentrated
every
man
and
musket
on
gijon
but
the
squadron
having
thus
drawn
him
westward
sailed
in
the
opposite
direction
and
after
threatening
santona
was
about
to
touch
at
vivero
when
it
was
scattered
by
a
hurricane
from
the
bay
of
biscay
a
spanish
frigate
and
brig
an
english
brig
and
several
gunboats
and
transports
were
dashed
on
the
rocky
coast
and
lost
with
all
hands
this
disaster
which
cost
lives
compelled
renovales
to
return
to
corunna
november
but
the
raid
had
not
been
useless
it
had
compelled
bonnet
to
evacuate
many
posts
distracted
the
garrisons
of
santander
and
biscay
and
even
induced
caffarelli
to
march
down
to
the
coast
with
his
division
the
reserve
of
the
army
of
serras
too
had
drawn
up
the
greater
part
of
his
scattered
division
to
the
thus
leaving
the
borders
of
galicia
and
the
hardly
watched
this
enabled
mahy
to
send
down
troops
into
the
plain
of
leon
and
to
establish
something
like
a
blockade
around
astorga
but
all
the
operations
of
the
of
galicia
were
feeble
and
tentative
he
passed
among
his
countrymen
as
an
man
destitute
of
energy
or
initiative
silveira
in
the
a
more
active
but
a
more
dangerous
man
to
entrust
with
troops
took
advantage
of
serras
s
absence
to
cross
the
douro
invest
almeida
and
cut
the
communication
between
that
place
and
ciudad
rodrigo

pp
see
for
this
verdict
both
arteche
and
toreno
see
such
was
the
effect
of
the
even
when
it
was
used
sparingly
and
by
unskilful
hands
the
raids
along
the
northern
coast
had
kept
bonnet
and
the
troops
in
santander
and
biscay
fully
employed
they
had
distracted
serras
caffarelli
and
even
the
garrisons
of
the
province
of
burgos
they
had
saved
mahy
and
silveira
from
attack
and
had
lighted
up
a
blaze
of
insurrection
in
the
western
hills
of
cantabria
which
thanks
to
the
energy
of
porlier
and
his
colleague
louga
was
never
extinguished
meanwhile
the
mass
of
french
troops
between
burgos
and
pampeluna
the
corps
the
young
guard
divisions
and
the
garrison
in
navarre
had
been
contained
by
an
enemy
of
a
different
sort
here
the
influence
of
the
british
naval
supremacy
was
little
felt
it
was
due
to
the
energy
of
spaniards
alone
that
the
men
under
drouet
roguet
and
dumoustier
and
reille
were
prevented
during
the
months
of
september
october
and
november
from
doing
anything
to
help
masséna
old
castile
navarre
and
the
lands
of
the
upper
ebro
were
kept
in
a
constant
turmoil
by
a
score
of
guerrillero
chiefs
of
whom
the
elder
mina
was
the
leading
figure
we
have
already
had
occasion
to
speak
of
the
exploits
of
his
relative
the
student
as
he
was
called
to
distinguish
him
from
his
uncle
and
have
noted
his
final
capture
by
suchet
francisco
espoz
y
mina
had
rallied
the
relics
of
his
nephew
s
band
and
began
his
long
career
of
raids
and
in
april
his
central
place
of
refuge
was
the
rough
country
on
the
borders
of
navarre
and
aragon
where
he
kept
his
main
dépôt
at
the
head
of
the
valley
of
roncal
but
he
often
ranged
as
far
afield
as
biscay
and
the
provinces
of
soria
and
burgos
almost
from
his
first
appearance
he
obtained
a
mastery
over
the
other
chiefs
who
operated
on
both
sides
of
the
upper
ebro
having
won
his
place
by
the
summary
process
of
seizing
and
shooting
one
echeverria
who
as
he
writes
was
the
terror
of
the
villages
of
navarre
which
he
oppressed
and
plundered
in
a
thousand
ways
till
they
complained
to
me
concerning
him
i
arrested
him
at
estella
on
june
caused
him
to
be
shot
with
three
of
his
principal
accomplices
and
incorporated
his
band
foot
and
horse
with
my
own
men
mina
was
the
special
enemy
of
reille
then
commanding
in
navarre
but
he
also
attracted
the
attention
of
drouet
one
of
whose
divisions
was
entirely
absorbed
in
hunting
him
during
the
autumn
of
this
was
the
main
cause
of
the
of
the
corps
at
rodrigo
and
salamanca
when
masséna
was
so
anxiously
awaiting
its
arrival
mina
s
lot
during
this
period
was
no
enviable
one
he
was
beset
on
all
sides
by
flying
columns
and
was
often
forced
to
bid
his
band
disperse
and
lurk
in
small
parties
in
the
mountains
till
the
enemy
should
have
passed
on
sometimes
he
was
lurking
with
seven
companions
only
in
a
cave
or
a
gorge
at
another
he
would
be
found
with
men
attacking
large
convoys
or
even
surprising
one
of
the
blockhouses
with
which
the
french
tried
to
cover
his
whole
sphere
of
activity
the
regency
admiring
his
perseverance
gave
him
in
september
the
title
of
colonel
and
of
all
the
guerrilleros
of
he
asserts
with
pride
in
his
memoir
that
he
was
at
one
and
the
same
time
being
hunted
by
dorsenne
commanding
at
burgos
reille
from
navarre
caffarelli

is
no
exaggeration
in
this
his
services
were
invaluable
during
the
campaign
of
portugal
since
he
was
wearing
out
a
french
force
of
five
times
his
own
strength
in
fruitless
marches
under
winter
rains
and
over
roads

had

him
no

it
to
him

him
with
much

work
during
the
campaign
of
the
pyrenees
the
suffering
inflicted
on
the
provinces
of
the
upper
ebro
by
mina
s
activity
was
of
course
terrible
the
french
destroyed
every
village
that
sheltered
him
or
furnished
him
with
recruits
and
were
wont
to
shoot
every
prisoner
from
his
band
that
they
caught
till
he
began
to
retaliate
by
corresponding
or
greater
numbers
of
executions
from
the
considerable
number
of
prisoners
in
his
hands
in
this
barbarous
system
was
in
full
swing
on
both
sides
but
it
was
put
to
an
end
by
mutual
agreement
in
in
addition
to
the
woes
that
navarre
and
its
neighbours
suffered
under
the
french
martial
law
and
by
the
monstrous
requisitions
imposed
upon
them
to
feed
the
mass
of
troops
forming
the
flying
columns
they
had
also
to
maintain
the
patriotic
bands
mina
declares
that
he
always
took
rations
for
his
men
but
avoided
levying
money
contributions
on
the
peasantry
depending
on
his
booty
the
rents
of
national
and
ecclesiastical
property
on
which
he
laid
hands
on
fines
inflicted
on
bad
spaniards

who
had
done
anything
to
help
his
pursuers
and
on
the
which
i
established

the
very
frontier

strange
secret
agreement

guaranteed
against

the
district
which
mina

bands
infested

s
eastward
of
mina
s
sphere
of
activity
the
guerrilleros
were
more
numerous
but
less
powerful
among
the
chief
of
them
was
julian
sanchez
who
with
a
mounted
band
of
to
lancers
infantry
would
have
been
easily
caught
in
the
plain
of
leon
busied
himself
in
cutting
the
communication
between
salamanca
ciudad
rodrigo
zamora
and
valladolid
and
was
kellermann
s
chief
tormentor
he
was
in
regular
communication
with
wellington
and
sent
him
many
captured
dispatches
and
useful
pieces
of
information
in
old
castile
the
priest
geronimo
merino
generally
known
as
el
cura
was
the
most
famous
and
most
active
among
many
leaders
it
was
his
band
aided
by
that
of
tapia
also
a
cleric
which
on
july
fought
a
most
daring
and
desperate
action
at
almazan
near
soria
with
two
french
battalions
of
marines
who
were
marching
the
one
to
join
masséna
the
other
to
join
soult
it
cost
the
enemy
no
less
than
officers
de
as
the
paris
archives
show
and
over
men
though
the
guerrilleros
were
finally
beaten
off
in
october
he
surprised
and
captured
an
enormous
convoy
of
corn
and
munitions
of
war
whose
loss
put
the
french
garrison
of
burgos
in
considerable
straits
for
some
weeks
he
waged
with
dorsenne
the
same
horrible
contest
of
retaliation
in
the
shooting
of
prisoners
which
mina
was
at
the
same
time
carrying
on
with
the
generals
in
navarre
there
were
many
other
bands
in
old
castile
those
of
abril
tenderin
saornil
principe
and
others
of
whom
some
are
accused
by
their
own
colleagues
of
being
more
harmful
to
the
than
to
the
french
from
their
reckless
and
miscellaneous
plundering
and
their
refusal
to
combine
for
any
systematic
action
yet
even
the
worst
of
them
contributed
to
distract
the
activity
of
the
french
garrisons
and
to
retard
the
communication
of
dispatches
and
the
march
of
isolated
detachments
under
the
easy
excuse
that
it
was
dangerous
to
move
any
small
body
of
men
along
the
the
french
commanders
of
every
small
town
or
blockhouse
detained
for
weeks
and
even
months
drafts
on
their
way
to
the
south
or
the
west
with
the
result
that
the
number
of
recruits
received
at
madrid
seville
or
salamanca
never
bore
any
proper
proportion
to
the
total
that
had

the
dominating

louga

to

distinction

the
cutting
of

took
no

turn
during

of
though
one
dreadful
blow
to

the
loss
of

was
to
fall
in
the
winter
which
followed

left
suchet
in

established
in
his
positions
at
lerida
and
mequinenza
master
of
all
the
of
aragon
as
well
as
of
a
strip
of
western
catalonia
and
only
waiting
for
the
of
macdonald
and
the
corps
to
recommence
his
operations
that
however
was
long
denied
him
the
emperor
s
last
general
orders
which
had
reached
suchet
in
june
briefly
prescribed
to
him
that
the
conquest
of
the
city
and
kingdom
of
valencia
was
his
final
object
but
that
he
must
first
break
the
spanish
line
by
capturing
tortosa
the
great
fortress
of
the
lower
ebro
and
tarragona
the
main
stronghold
of
southern
catalonia
for
both
these
latter
operations
he
was
to
count
on
the
aid
of
macdonald
and
the
army
of
catalonia
relying
on
this
support
suchet
after
less
than
a
month
had
elapsed
since
the
capture
of
mequinenza
had
pushed
his
advanced
guard
down
the
ebro
till
it
was
at
the
very
gates
of
tortosa
one
detachment
even
passed
the
town
and
seized
the
ferry
of
amposta
the
only
passage
of
the
ebro
near
its
mouth
actually
cutting
the
great
road
from
tarragona
to
valencia
and
only
leaving
the
bridge
of
tortosa
itself
open
for
the
linking
of
the
operations
of
caro
and
o
donnell
meanwhile
suchet
was
preparing
his
at
mequinenza
and
waiting
for
a
rise
in
the
ebro
which
would
commence
to
become
navigable
with
the
arrival
of
the
autumn
rains
in
order
to
ship
his
guns
to
their
destined
goal
he
was
at
the
same
time
making
the
land
route
to
tortosa
passable
by
repairing
the
old
military
road
from
caspe
to
mora
and
tivisa
which
had
been
constructed
during
the
wars
of
the
spanish
succession
but
had
long
ago
fallen
into
ruin
see
pp
under
may
under
suchet
was
quite
aware
that
by
thrusting
a
comparatively
small
force
he
had
only
brought
up
men
into
the
near
neighbourhood
of
tortosa
he
was
risking
the
danger
of
being
attacked
at
once
by
the
army
of
valencia
from
the
south
and
o
donnell
s
catalans
from
the
north
but
he
trusted
that
macdonald
and
the
corps
would
keep
the
latter
the
more
formidable
enemy
employed
while
he
had
a
contempt
for
the
generalship
of
caro
who
had
always
proved
himself
the
most
incompetent
and
timid
of
commanders
but
macdonald
arrived
late
having
been
forced
to
spend
the
whole
summer
as
has
been
already
related
in
his
triple
revictualling
of
barcelona
and
meanwhile
the
valencian
army
came
to
the
front
its
leading
division
under
bassecourt
threatened
morella
on
suchet
s
flank
early
in
august
hoping
to
draw
him
away
to
defend
this
outpost
but
a
single
brigade
under
montmarie
sufficed
to
turn
back
the
valencian
detachment
and
suchet
kept
his
positions
o
donnell
meanwhile
vainly
hoping
for
solid
help
from
caro
had
joined
the
division
of
his
army
which
was
kept
at
falcet
and
after
threatening
suchet
s
head
quarters
at
mora
on
july
so
as
to
distract
his
attention
suddenly
turned
aside
and
entered
tortosa
with
men
calling
out
all
the
troops
available
for
a
sortie
he
issued
from
the
town
on
august
and
beat
up
the
outposts
of
the
division
under
laval
which
was
in
observation
before
his
gates
but
though
the
catalans
fought
fiercely
and
drove
in
the
first
french
line
they
were
not
strong
enough
to
push
the
enemy
away
from
tortosa
o
donnell
should
have
brought
a
heavier
force
if
he
intended
to
accomplish
his
end
shortly
after
he
returned
to
tarragona
whither
he
was
called
by
the
movements
of
macdonald
see
see
some
days
later
than
he
had
covenanted
caro
came
up
to
vinaros
on
the
from
valencia
and
to
san
mateo
on
the
parallel
inland
road
with
his
whole
army
including
the
force
which
bassecourt
had
been
commanding
it
consisted
of
no
more
than
troops
of
the
line
who
had
been
joined
by
nearly
as
many
unregimented
peasants
in
loose
guerrilla
bands
the
whole
mass
was
far
from
being
formidable
as
suchet
knew
wherefore
the
french
general
cutting
down
to
the
smallest
possible
figure
the
containing
troops
left
before
tortosa
and
at
his
head
quarters
at
mora
marched
with
eleven
battalions
and
a
cavalry
regiment
only
men
in
all
to
meet
the
valencians
he
drove
their
advanced
cavalry
from
vinaros
and
advanced
against
their
positions
at
calig
and
cervera
del
maestre
caro
at
once
ordered
a
precipitate
retreat
and
did
not
stop
till
he
had
placed
thirty
miles
between
himself
and
the
enemy
his
obvious
terror
and
dismay
at
the
approach
of
the
french
roused
such
anger
that
he
was
summoned
to
give
up
the
command
by
his
own
officers
and
obeyed
without
hesitation
he
fled
by
sea
to
majorca
knowing
it
is
said
that
he
would
have
been
torn
to
pieces
if
he
had
shown
his
face
before
the
populace
at
valencia
over
which
he
had
exercised
a
sort
of
dictatorship
for
more
than
a
year
suchet
unable
to
catch
such
an
evasive
enemy
and
regarding
the
routed
army
as
a
negligible
quantity
returned
to
mora
where
he
received
the
news
that
the
macdonald
was
at
last
about
to
appear

had
thrown
the
third
and
last
of

convoys
into

on
the
of

having
brought
with
him
as
its

the
french
division
of
his
army
which
was
now
commanded
by

and
the
italian
divisions

he
had
left
behind
him

in

which

had
been
wont
to
hold
as
the
defender
of

northern
catalonia
as
far
as
hostalrich
eighteen
thousand
men
were
told
off
for
this
task
including
all
the
german
brigades
but
after
garrisoning
gerona
rosas
figueras
and
hostalrich

had
no

left

found
full

warding
off

and
the
other
miquelete
leaders
upon
the
communication
between
gerona
and

nearly
men
had
also
been
left
in
barcelona
including
many
sick
and
the
three
divisions
with
which
macdonald
marched
to
join
suchet
did
not
exceed
sabres
and
bayonets
though
the
whole
force
of
the
corps
was
reckoned
at
over

recalled
on

macdonald
forced
the
pass
of
ordal
after
some
skirmishing
with
the
somatenes
and
entered
the
plain
of
tarragona
it
was
the
news
of
his
approach
to
the
catalan
capital
which
brought
o
donnell
back
in
haste
from
tortosa
he
concentrated
the
greater
part
of
his
troops
on
the
hypothesis
that
the
corps
might
be
intending
to
lay
siege
to
the
place
he
brought
down
campoverde
s
division
from
the
north
to
join
those
of
ibarrola
sarsfield
and
the
baron
de
eroles
which
were
already
on
the
spot
it
soon
became
known
however
to
the
spaniards
that
macdonald
could
not
be
bent
on
siege
operations
for
he
was
bringing
with
him
neither
the
heavy
artillery
nor
the
enormous
train
of
provisions
that
would
be
required
in
such
a
case
he
marched
past
reus
and
valls
to
momblanch
skirmishing
all
the
way
with
o
donnell
s
detachments
and
thence
to
lerida
which
he
reached
on
august
there
he
found
suchet
awaiting
him
for
a
conference
the
orders
from
paris
on
which
both
were
acting
seemed
to
prescribe
that
tortosa
and
tarragona
should
both
be
attacked
but
the
general
and
the
marshal
agreed
that
their
joint
strength
was
not
more
than
enough
for
one
siege
at
a
time
they
agreed
that
the
corps
should
undertake
the
leaguer
of
tortosa
and
the
containing
of
the
valencian
army
while
the
should
cover
these
operations
by
keeping
o
donnell
and
the
catalans
fully
employed
suchet
therefore
drew
his
detachments
southward
from
lerida
and
the
plains
of
the
segre
handing
over
all
that
tract
to
macdonald
from
this
fertile
region
alone
could
the
marshal
have
fed
his
corps
central
catalonia
being
barren
and
so
overrun
by
o
donnell
s
detachments
that
it
was
impossible
to
forage
freely
within
its
bounds
suchet
undertook
to
provide
for
his
own
corps
during
the
siege
of
tortosa
by
bringing
up
stores
from
saragossa
and
the
valley
of
the
ebro
via
mequinenza
macdonald
lent
him
meanwhile
the
weakest
of
his
three
divisions
neapolitans
under
pignatelli
who
were
to
escort
the
for
tortosa
along
the
ebro

autumn
rains

and

in
while
suchet
was
moving
southward
and
making
ready
for
the
siege
the
duke
of
tarentum
established
himself
with
head
quarters
at
cervera
on
the
road
and
brigades
at
lerida
agramunt
and
tarrega
all
in
the
plain
he
was
ready
to
fall
upon
o
donnell
s
flank
if
the
catalans
should
make
any
attempt
to
succour
tortosa
by
marching
from
tarragona
along
the
roads
parallel
to
the
sea
coast
meanwhile
he
had
completely
lost
touch
both
with
the
garrison
of
barcelona
and
with
baraguay
d
hilliers
in
the
ampurdam
this
was
the
regular
state
of
things
during
the
catalan
war
for
if
the
french
left
detachments
to
guard
a
line
of
communication
they
were
invariably
cut
off
by
the
enemy
while
if
they
did
not
the
roads
were
blocked
and
no
information
came
through
so
vigorous
were
the
somatenes
at
this
moment
that
small
parties
moving
from
tarrega
to
cervera
places
only
twelve
miles
apart
and
in
the
middle
of
the
cantonments
of
the
corps
were
not
unfrequently
waylaid
and
destroyed
macdonald
despite
his
humanity
was
forced
to
burn
villages
and
shoot
assassins
caught
he
lay
in
the
position
which
he
had
taken
up
on
september
for
the
greater
part
of
that
month
and
the
succeeding
october
concentrating
at
intervals
a
part
of
his
forces
for
an
expedition
into
the
hills
when
the
catalans
pressed
him
too
closely
at
the
commencement
of
his
sojourn
in
the
plains
he
sent
severoli
with
an
italian
brigade
to
collect
provisions
in
the
valley
of
the
noguera
palleresa
this
raid
led
to
dreadful
ravaging
of
the
but
severoli
returned
with
no
spoil
and
many
wounded
he
had
pushed
his
advance
as
far
as
talarn
skirmishing
the
whole
way
and
driving
the
somatenes
before
him
but
could
accomplish
nothing
save
the
burning
of
poor
villages
evacuated
by
their
inhabitants
a
week
later
other
expeditions
scoured
the
mountain
sides
eastward
with
little
more
success
for
details
see
vacani
iv
pp
meanwhile
though
macdonald
imagined
that
he
was
not
only
protecting
suchet
s
northern
flank
but
also
attracting
the
attention
of
o
donnell
to
himself
the
enterprising
spanish
general
had
contrived
an
unwelcome
surprise
for
him
he
knew
that
he
was
not
strong
enough
to
fight
the
corps
in
the
open
field
nor
even
to
face
suchet
by
making
another
attempt
to
relieve
tortosa
which
place
for
the
moment
was
in
no
immediate
danger
he
therefore
resolved
to
draw
macdonald
from
his
present
position
by
a
blow
at
the
corner
of
catalonia
where
the
french
were
weakest
the
marshal
considered
that
baraguay
d
hilliers
was
perfectly
safe
in
the
northern
region
which
he
garrisoned
since
no
regular
spanish
force
was
now
in
arms
in
that
direction
o
donnell
resolved
to
undeceive
him
leaving
the
two
divisions
of
obispo
and
eroles
to
block
the
road
from
macdonald
s
post
at
cervera
to
barcelona
with
orders
to
retire
into
tarragona
if
hard
pressed
he
ordered
a
third
division
that
of
campoverde
to
prepare
for
a
forced
march
to
the
north
at
the
same
time
a
force
consisting
of
the
british
frigate
and
the
spanish
frigate
convoying
a
few
transports
with
men
on
board
for
disembarkation
sailed
from
tarragona
for
a
destination
which
was
kept
secret
to
the
last
moment
the
troops
were
under
doyle
the
british
commissioner
in
catalonia
captain
fane
of
the
was
senior
naval
officer
o
donnell
s
march
was
perilous
he
had
to
pass
close
to
the
front
of
the
garrisons
of
barcelona
hostalrich
and
gerona
through
a
most
difficult
and
mountainous
country
without
giving
any
signs
of
his
presence
for
if
his
movement
were
discovered
baraguay
d
hilliers
might
concentrate
his
scattered
brigades
and
crush
him
by
force
of
numbers
the
march
however
was
carried
out
with
complete
success
and
on
september
o
donnell
lay
with
infantry
and
horse
at
vidreras
south
of
gerona
while
the
naval
force
was
hovering
off
palamos
the
nearest
point
on
the
coast
the
rough
region
between
gerona
and
the
sea
was
at
this
moment
occupied
by
half
rouyer
s
division
of
troops
of
the
confederation
of
the
rhine
under
schwartz
the
general
whose
name
was
connected
with
the
disasters
of
bruch
and
manresa
he
had
with
him
four
weak
battalions
of
the
and
regiments
and
a
squadron
of
cuirassiers
a
force
which
owing
to
the
sickliness
of
the
autumn
season
did
not
amount
to
much
more
than
men
in
all
but
he
was
so
close
to
gerona
where
lay
rouyer
s
other
two
regiments
and
some
french
troops
that
he
was
not
considered
in
any
danger
by
his
superiors
schwartz
s
main
duty
was
to
prevent
any
communication
between
the
somatenes
of
the
inland
and
the
cruisers
which
were
always
passing
up
and
down
the
coast
provoked
by
a
recent
raid
at
bagur
on
september
where
an
english
had
stormed
one
of
his
coast
batteries
and
captured
the
garrison
of
men
schwartz
had
just
strengthened
all
his
posts
along
the
shore
he
had
only
men
at
his
head
quarters
at
la
bispal
the
rest
were
dispersed
between
bagur
san
feliu
palamos
and
the
connecting
post
at
calonje
on
the
morning
of
the
fourteenth
he
was
stricken
with
horror
when
his
outposts
informed
him
that
they
had
been
driven
in
by
spanish
infantry
and
cavalry
in
overwhelming
force
he
sent
orders
too
late
for
his
troops
on
the
coast
to
concentrate
and
prepared
to
fall
back
on
gerona
with
his
whole
force
but
his
messenger
had

was
attacked
by

donnell

drove
him
into
the
indefensible
castle
of

was
commanded
by
a
neighbouring
hill

the

of
the
village

losing
some

shot
down
from
these
points

schwartz
surrendered
at
nightfall
when
the
spaniards
were
preparing
to
storm
his
refuge
his
defence
can
not
have
been
very
desperate
as
he
had
lost
only
one
officer
and
four
men
killed
and
three
officers
and
sixteen
men
wounded
but
this
was
only

of

the
best
narrative
of
schwartz
s
disaster
may
be
found
in
the
diary
of
the
officer
barkhausen
one
of
the
prisoners

without
waiting
for
rouyer
and
baraguay
d
hilliers
to
assemble
their
forces
o
donnell
departed
from
the
scene
of
his
exploits
without
delay
he
himself
having
received
a
severe
wound
in
the
foot
embarked
with
the
prisoners
on
board
fane
s
ships
and
returned
to
tarragona
campoverde
with
the
retired
hastily
past
gerona
to
the
mountains
of
the
north
retook
puycerda
beat
up
the
outposts
of
the
french
garrison
of
montlouis
on
the
frontier
of
cerdagne
and
raised
some
contributions
on
the
other
side
of
the
pyrenees
from
thence
he
descended
the
segre
and
established
himself
at
cardona
and
calaf
facing
macdonald
s
northern
flank
so
thoroughly
had
the
main
body
of
the
corps
lost
touch
with
the
troops
left
behind
at
gerona
and
in
the
ampurdam
that
the
news
of
the
disaster
of
la
bispal
only
reached
macdonald
via
france
and
saragossa
more
than
a
fortnight
after
it
had
happened
it
alarmed
him
for
the
safety
of
the
north
but
did
not
suffice
to
draw
him
away
from
suchet
as
o
donnell
had
hoped
the
news
that
the
spanish
raiding
division
had
disappeared
from
the
neighbourhood
of
gerona
encouraged
him
to
remain
in
his
present
position
which
alone
made
the
siege
of
tortosa
possible
presently
he
was
informed
that
a
considerable
force
had
appeared
in
his
own
sphere
of
operations
this
being
the
same
division
of
campoverde
which
had
done
all
the
mischief
in
the
north
he
therefore
marched
on
october
with
two
french
and
two
italian
brigades
to
attack
this
new
enemy
on
the
next
day
he
occupied
solsona
where
the
junta
of
upper
catalonia
had
hitherto
been
sitting
the
place
was
found
deserted
by
its
inhabitants
and
was
plundered
its
great
cathedral
was
burnt
either
by
accident
or
design
on
the
however
when
the
marshal
came
in
front
of
cardona
he
found
the
town
the
inaccessible
castle
above
it
and
the
neighbouring
heights
manned
by
campoverde
s
division
strengthened
by
several
thousand
somatenes
of
the
district
the
italian
general
eugenio
marched
straight
at
the
position
with
salme
s
french
brigade
in
support
despising
his
enemy
and
not
waiting
for
the
and
the
reserves
he
met
with
a
sharp
repulse
for
the
spaniards
charged
his
columns
just
as
they
drew
near
the
crest
and
hurled
them
down
with
loss
macdonald
refused
to
throw
in
all
his
troops
and
contented
himself
with
bringing
off
the
routed
brigade
he
then
returned
to
solsona
and
cervera
much
harassed
in
his
retreat
by
the
somatenes
it
is
curious
that
he
did
not
press
the
combat
further
as
he
had
a
large
superiority
of
numbers
over
the
catalan
division
and
had
not
lost
much
more
than
men
in
the
first
clash
but
the
position
was
formidable
and
the
marshal
more
than
once
in
this
campaign
showed
himself
averse
to
taking
risks
perhaps
also
he
may
have
already
made
up
his
mind
to
return
to
the
east
and
abandon
suchet
since
it
was
at
about
this
time
that
more
disquieting
information
from
baraguay
d
hilliers
reached
him
by
way
of
france
martinien
s
invaluable
lists
show
only
three
italian
and
one
french
officer
hurt
which
agrees
well
enough
with
vacani
s
estimate
of
to
de
this
new
budget
of
troubles
contained
two
main
items
the
first
was
that
the
august
supplies
thrown
into
barcelona
were
nearly
exhausted
and
that
the
town
urgently
required
revictualling
the
second
was
that
it
was
impossible
to
send
on
the
necessary
convoys
because
of
the
extreme
activity
of
the
somatenes
and
the
inadequate
number
of
troops
left
in
northern
catalonia
one
considerable
train
of
waggons
had
been
captured
and
destroyed
near
la
junquera
on
the
very
frontier
of
france
by
the
baron
de
eroles
who
had
now
taken
up
the
command
of
the
northern
insurgents
another
was
standing
fast
at
gerona
for
want
of
sufficient
escort
a
third
had
been
collected
at
perpignan
but
dared
not
start
so
pressing
was
the
need
for
the
relief
of
barcelona
that
macdonald
made
up
his
mind
that
he
must
break
up
from
his
present
cantonments
even
at
the
risk
of
making
the
siege
of
tortosa
impossible
and
transfer
himself
to
the
accordingly
on
november
he
commenced
a
toilsome
march
by
way
of
calaf
manresa
and
hostalrich
to
gerona
where
he
arrived
in
safety
on
the
campoverde
followed
him
for
some
way
by
parallel
paths
along
the
mountains
but
never
dared
to
strike
the
strength
of
the
corps
when
it
marched
in
a
mass
being
too
great
for
him
it
is
probable
that
the
marshal
would
have
had
more
trouble
if
o
donnell
had
been
in
the
field
but
that
enterprising
general
was
not
yet
healed
of
the
wound
which
he
had
received
at
la
bispal
it
had
gangrened
and
he
had
been
sent
to
majorca
by
his
physicians
who
declared
that
a
complete
cessation
from
military
work
was
the
only
chance
of
saving
his
life
the
interim
command
was
turned
over
in
november
to
the
senior
in
catalonia
miguel
iranzo
a
very
poor
substitute
for
the
general
macdonald
having
joined
baraguay
d
hilliers
had
now
an
imposing
mass
of
troops
under
his
hand
moreover
he
got
back
the
services
of
his
old
divisional
generals
souham
and
pino
who
arrived
from
sick
leave
and
took
over
charge
of
the
divisions
lately
in
the
charge
of
frère
and
severoli
a
great
draft
from
france
and
italy
had
rejoined
in
their
company
the
marshal
was
therefore
able
to
collect
the
fractions
of
the
great
convoy
destined
for
barcelona
and
to
conduct
it
to
that
city
after
a
slow
and
cautious
march
on
november
he
then
changed
the
battalions
in
the
garrison
of
barcelona
where
he
left
both
pino
and
souham
sent
back
to
the
ampurdam
the
troops
he
had
borrowed
from
baraguay
d
hilliers
as
escort
for
the
returning
convoy
and
marched
for
the
second
time
to
join
suchet
moving
by
way
of
momblanch
he
got
once
more
into
touch
with
the
army
of
aragon
at
falcet
near
mora
on
december
thus
the
campaign
came
back
at
to
the
same
aspect
that
it
had
shown
in
the
first
days
of
september
it
has
been
the
wont
of
military
critics
to
throw
the
blame
for
the
lost
three
months
on
macdonald
but
this
seems
unfair
it
is
true
that
he
was
absent
from
the
post
which
he
had
promised
to
hold
for
the
protection
of
suchet
s
rear
from
november
to
december
but
why
had
so
little
been
done
to
forward
the
siege
of
tortosa
during
the
time
from
september
to
november
two
whole
months
while
the
marshal
was
in
the
covenanted
position
and
actually
carrying
out
his
promise
to
contain
the
catalans
and
leave
suchet
s
hands
free
for
the
actual
prosecution
of
the
projected
siege
the
commander
of
the
army
of
aragon
had
been
given
two
of
the
best
campaigning
months
of
the
year
september
and
october
and
had
no
enemy
about
him
save
the
valencian
army
the
local
somatenes
of
the
lower
ebro
and
the
scattered
bands
of
villacampa
in
the
hills
of
upper
aragon
it
was
only
sixty
miles
from
his
base
at
mequinenza
where
his
had
been
collected
months
before
to
the
walls
of
tortosa
and
he
had
brought
up
his
field
army
before
that
place
as
early
as
august
no
doubt
the
country
between
mequinenza
and
tortosa
is
rough
and
its
roads
execrable
while
along
the
ebro
was
rendered
more
difficult
than
usual
by
a
rather
dry
autumn
which
kept
the
river
low
but
heavy
were
got
down
to
xerta
only
ten
miles
from
tortosa
as
early
as
september
during
a
lucky
flood
while
a
considerable
number
more
were
pushed
to
the
front
during
the
same
month
by
the
land
route
formed
by
suchet
s
new
military
road
from
caspe
to
mora
it
seems
therefore
that
suchet
s
inactivity
in
september
and
october
can
be
explained
neither
by
laying
blame
on
macdonald
nor
by
exaggerating
the
difficulties
of
transport
if
as
he
wrote
himself
notre
corps
d
armée
se
trouvait
enchaîné
sur
le
bas
ebre
sans
pouvoir
agir
et
son
chef
n
avait
d
espoir
que
dans
une
crue
d
eau
et
dans
le
secours
des
circonstances
he
was
himself
responsible
for
his
failure
either
from
or
because
he
had
undertaken
a
task
beyond
his
means
the
real
cause
of
his
two
months
delay
was
the
vigorous
action
of
the
enemy
there
was
no
danger
from
the
disorganized
valencian
army
which
only
made
a
feeble
attempt
on
november
to
beat
up
the
small
force
under
general
musnier
which
lay
at
uldecona
to
cover
the
blockade
of
tortosa
from
the
south
the
attack
led
by
bassecourt
was
driven
off
with
ease
the
real
opponents
of
suchet
were
the
irregular
forces
of
the
catalans
and
the
aragonese
insurgents
in
his
rear
the
former
though
few
in
numbers
since
macdonald
was
attracting
their
main
attention
attacked
every
convoy
that
tried
to
float
down
the
gorge
of
the
ebro
and
sometimes
with
success
on
the
of
september
they
captured
a
whole
battalion
of
pignatelli
s
neapolitans
which
was
acting
as
guard
to
some
boats
on
other
occasions
they
took
or
destroyed
smaller
or
greater
portions
of
flotillas
carrying
guns
or
stores
to
xerta
where
the
siege
park
was
being
collected
but
villacampa
s
aragonese
gave
even
greater
trouble
from
his
lair
in
the
sierra
de
albaracin
that
enterprising
partisan
made
countless
descents
upon
suchet
s
rear
and
so
molested
the
garrisons
of
upper
aragon
that
the
french
general
had
repeatedly
to
send
back
troops
from
his
main
body
to
clear
the
roads
behind
him
villacampa
was
beaten
whenever
he
tried
to
fight
large
bodies
even
though
he
was
aided
by
a
general
carbajal
whom
the
regency
had
sent
from
cadiz
with
money
and
arms
to
stir
up
a
general
revolt
in
the
region
the
polish
general
chlopiski
detached
in
haste
from
the
blockade
of
tortosa
broke
the
forces
of
carbajal
and
villacampa
in
two
successive
engagements
at
alventosa
on
the
borders
of
valencia
october
and
fuensanta
near
teruel
november
the
insurrection
died
down
villacampa
retired
into
his
mountains
and
chlopiski
returned
to
the
main
army
but
only
a
few
days
later
suchet
had
to
cope
with
a
new
danger
macdonald
having
taken
himself
off
to
gerona
the
catalans
were
at
last
able
to
detach
regular
troops
to
reinforce
the
somatenes
of
the
lower
ebro
a
brigade
under
general
garcia
navarro
came
up
to
falcet
opposite
mora
and
formed
the
nucleus
of
a
raiding
force
which
beset
the
whole
left
bank
of
the
ebro
and
made
its
navigation
almost
impossible
suchet
had
to
detach
against
it
seven
battalions
under
abbé
and
habert
who
attacked
navarro
s
entrenched
camp
at
falcet
on
november
and
stormed
it
the
spanish
general
who
showed
distinguished
personal
courage
and
charged
valiantly
at
the
head
of
his
reserves
was
taken
prisoner
with
some
men
the
somatenes
fled
to
the
hills
again
and
the
regulars
retired
to
reus
near
tarragona
where
they
were
out
of
suchet
s
sphere
of
operations
it
was
just
after
this
combat
that
the
unfortunate
army
of
valencia
made
the
useless
diversion
of
which
we
have
already
spoken
it
at
least
kept
suchet
busy
for
a
few
days
by
the
time
that
it
was
over
the
greater
part
of
the
remaining
was
ready
at
xerta
the
down
the
ebro
having
become
easy
since
garcia
navarro
s
defeat
when
therefore
macdonald
s
arrival
at
momblanch
was
reported
at
suchet
s
head
quarters
and
an
adequate
was
once
more
placed
between
him
and
the
catalan
army
in
the
direction
of
tarragona
the
actual
leaguer
of
tortosa
could
at
length
begin
it
lasted
short
though
it
was
till
the
new
year
of
had
come
and
must
therefore
be
described
not
here
but
in
the
fourth
volume
of
this
work
see
especially
napier

suchet
i
see

page
thus
six
months
had
elapsed
between
the
fall
of
lerida
and
the
commencement
of
the
next
stage
of
the
french
advance
in
eastern
spain
if
it
is
asked
why
the
delay
was
so
long
the
answer
is
easy
it
was
due
not
as
some
have
maintained
to
suchet
s
slowness
or
to
macdonald
s
caution
but
solely
to
the
splendid
activity
displayed
by
henry
o
donnell
a
general
often
beaten
but
never
dismayed
and
to
the
tenacity
of
the
catalans
who
never
gave
up
hope
and
were
still
to
hold
their
own
after
a
hundred
disasters
till
the
tide
of
success
in
the
peninsula
at
last
turned
back
in
section
xxii
chapter
ii
king
joseph
and
the
cortes
at
cadiz
general
summary
it
only
remains
that
we
should
deal
shortly
with
the
higher
politics
of
spain
during
the
last
months
of
the
troubles
of
king
joseph
and
the
complications
caused
by
the
meeting
of
the
cortes
at
cadiz
of
the
growing
friction
between
the
king
and
the
commanders
of
the
military
governments
created
by
the
emperor
in
february
we
have
already
spoken
joseph
did
well
to
be
angry
when
his
dispatches
to
saragossa
or
barcelona
were
deliberately
disregarded
by
his
brother
s
special
orders
but
things
became
worse
when
he
was
not
merely
ignored
but
openly
contemned
a
few
examples
may
suffice
in
the
early
summer
a
brigade
sent
out
by
marshal
ney
raided
the
province
of
avila
which
was
not
included
in
any
of
the
military
governments
raised
requisitions
there
and
what
was
still
more
insulting
seized
and
carried
off
the
treasure
in
the
offices
of
the
civil
of
the
province
joseph
wrote
to
paris
that
the
emperor
can
not
be
desirous
that
his
own
brother
however
unworthy
should
be
openly
humiliated
and
insulted
that
he
asked
for
justice
and
abstained
from
any
further
comment
napoleon
replied
by
placing
avila
in
the
block
of
provinces
allotted
to
the
army
of
portugal
and
withdrew
it
for
the
time
from
the
king
s
authority
it
was
soon
after
that
he
created
kellermann
s
new
military
government
of
valladolid
thus
taking
another
region
from
under
the
direct
authority
of
joseph
some
months
later
kellermann
asserted
the
complete
independence
of
his
viceroyalty
by
causing
the
judges
of
the
of
old
castile
which
sat
at
valladolid
to
take
a
new
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
emperor
of
the
french
as
if
they
had
ceased
to
be
subjects
of
the
kingdom
of
spain
soult
too
continued
as
has
been
shown
before
to
cut
off
all
revenues
which
the
king
might
have
received
from
andalusia
and
joseph

that
he
wished
to
surrender
his
crown
to
the
emperor
was
drawn
up
as
the
autumn
drew
near
it
deserves
a
record
it
is
absolutely
reasonable
and
confines
itself
to
hard
facts
since
your
majesty
withdraws
andalusia
from
my
sphere
of
command
and
orders
that
the
revenues
of
that
province
should
be
devoted
exclusively
to
military
expenses
i
have
no
choice
left
but
to
throw
up
the
game
in
the
actual
state
of
affairs
in
spain
the
general
who
commands
each
province
is
a
king
therein
the
whole
revenues
of
the
province
will
never
suffice
to
keep
him
for
what
he
calls
his
absolute
necessities
have
never
been
formally
stated
and
as
the
revenues
rise
he
augments
his
hence
it
results
that
any
province
under
the
command
of
a
general
is
useless
for
my
budget
from
andalusia
alone
i
hoped
to
get
a
certain
surplus
after
all
military
expenses
had
been
paid
but
its
command
is
given
over
to
a
general
who
would
never
recognize
my
authority
and
with
the
command
he
gets
the
administrative
and
governmental
rights
thus
i
have
been
stripped
of
the
only
region
which
could
have
given
me
a
sufficient
maintenance
i
am
reduced
to
madrid
new
castile
which
yields
francs
per
mensem
while
the
indispensable
expenses
of
the
central
government
amount
to
francs
per
mensem
i
have
around
me
the
wrecks
of
what
was
once
a
great
national
administration
with
a
guard
the
dépôts
and
hospital
of
the
army
a
garrison
a
royal
household
a
ministry
a
council
of
state
and
the
refugees
from
the
rebel
provinces
this
state
of
affairs
could
not
endure
for
two
months
longer
even
if
my
honour
and
the
consciousness
of
what
is
due
to
me
would
allow
me
to
remain
in
this
humiliating
position
since
the
army
of
andalusia
has
been
taken
from
me
what
am
i
the
manager
of
the
hospitals
and
magazines
of
madrid
the
head
jailer
of
the
central
dépôt
of
prisoners
joseph
then
states
his
conditions
if
he
is
allowed
to
have
a
real
control
over
the
whole
army
to
send
back
to
france
officers
of
whatever
rank
notoriously
guilty
of
maladministration
to
reassure
his
spanish
partisans
as
to
rumours
current
concerning
his
own
forced
abdication
and
the
dismemberment
of
the
monarchy
to
issue
what
proclamations
he
pleases
to
his
subjects
without
being
placed
under
a
sort
of
censorship
he
will
retain
his
crown
and
pledge
himself
to
reduce
all
spain
and
make
the
country
as
profitable
to
the
interests
of
france
as
it
is
now
if
not
he
must
consider
the
question
of
retiring
across
the
pyrenees
and
surrendering
his
crown
joseph
to
napoleon
ducasse
vii
napoleon
could
not
give
any
such
promises
and
for
good
reasons
he
rightly
distrusted
his
brother
s
military
ability
and
knew
that
whatever
was
the
title
given
to
joseph
men
like
soult
or
masséna
would
disregard
his
orders
apparently
he
considered
that
a
conflict
of
authorities
in
spain
such
as
had
been
existing
for
the
last
six
months
was
at
least
better
than
the
concentration
of
power
in
the
hands
of
one
indifferent
it
is
doubtful
whether
he
did
not
err
in
his
conclusion
almost
anything
was
better
than
the
existing
anarchy
tempered
by
orders
six
weeks
late
from
paris
but
a
second
and
a
more
fatal
objection
to
granting
joseph
s
conditions
was
that
the
rumours
current
concerning
the
dismemberment
of
the
spanish
monarchy
were
absolutely
true
napoleon
was
at
this
moment
at
the
very
height
of
his
wild
craze
for
adding
alien
and
heterogeneous
provinces
to
the
french
empire
in
the
supposed
interest
of
the
continental
system
it
was
in
that
he
declared
holland
and
the
valais
hamburg
and
bremen
oldenburg
and
dalmatia
integral
parts
of
his
dominions
and
northern
spain
was
destined
to
suffer
the
same
fate
mina
and
rovira
eroles
and
manso
were
to
wake
some
morning
to
find
themselves
french
subjects
on
october
the
emperor
wrote
to
berthier
you
will
inform
general
caffarelli
in
strict
confidence
that
my
intention
is
that
biscay
shall
be
united
to
france
he
must
not
speak
of
this
intention
but
he
must
act
with
full
knowledge
of
it
make
the
same
private
communication
to
general
reille
about
navarre
aragon
or
at
least
the
portion
of
it
north
of
the
ebro
and
catalonia
were
to
suffer
the
same
fate
already
justice
was
administered
there
in
the
name
of
the
emperor
not
in
that
of
the
king
of
spain
and
a
coinage
was
being
struck
at
barcelona
which
no
longer
bore
the
name
of
joseph
napoleon
king
of
spain
and
the
indies
xxi
for
a
specimen
see
the
plate
of
coins
in
vol
ii
facing
the
line
of
argument
which
napoleon
adopted
with
regard
to
this
proposed
annexation
is
very
curious
his
directions
to
his
foreign
minister
champagny
run
as
follows
herewith
i
send
you
back
the
spanish
documents
with
six
observations
which
are
to
serve
as
the
base
for
negotiation
but
it
is
important
that
you
should
broach
the
matter
gently
you
must
first
state
clearly
what
are
my
opinions
on
the
convention
of
bayonne
viz
that
the
emperor
regards
his
guarantee
of
the
integrity
of
spain
as
out
of
date
and
cancelled
then
speak
of
portugal
and
next
of
the
expense
that
this
country
spain
costs
me
then
let
the
spanish
envoys
have
time
to
reflect
and
only
after
an
interval
of
some
days
tell
them
that
i
must
have
the
left
bank
of
the
ebro
as
an
indemnity
for
the
money
and
all
else
that
spain
has
cost
me
down
to
this
hour
i
think
that
as
in
all
negotiations
we
must
not
show
ourselves
too
much
in
a
the
mention
of
portugal
means
that
the
emperor
contemplated
making
his
brother
a
present
of
the
lusitanian
realm
where
spain
was
hated
only
one
degree
less
than
france
as
a
compensation
for
catalonia
and
the
rest
on
the
same
morning
that
mina
found
himself
a
frenchman
all
the
ordenança
of
the
beira
hills
were
to
discover
that
they
were
castilians
mad
disregard
of
national
feeling
could
go
no
further
napoleon
to
champagny
i
can
not
find
anywhere
any
authority
for
napier
s
strange
statement
iii
that
it
was
almenara
and
not
napoleon
who
started
the
idea
that
portugal
should
be
exchanged
for
the
ebro
province
the
nearest
thing
to
it
is
that
m
d
almenara
déclare
formellement
qu
il
ne
consente
à
aucune
cession
de
territoire
espagnol
que
cette
compensation
portugal
ne
soit
pas
stipulée
et
garantie
mais
comme
il
est
dans
l
intention
formelle
du
roi
de
ne
pas
consentir
à
aucun
démembrement
même
avec
une
compensation
plus
avantageuse
il
n
aurait
jamais
ratifié
un
pareil
ducasse
vii
a
letter
to
the
french
ambassador
at
madrid
explained
at
much
greater
length
the
emperor
s
reasons
for
breaking
the
oath
that
he
had
sworn
to
his
brother
at
bayonne
when
he
named
him
king
of
spain
when
the
promise
was
made
his
majesty
had
supposed
that
he
had
rallied
to
his
cause
the
majority
of
the
spanish
nation
this
has
proved
not
to
be
the
case
the
whole
people
took
arms
the
new
king
had
to
fly
from
madrid
and
was
only
restored
by
french
bayonets
since
then
he
has
hardly
rallied
a
recruit
to
his
cause
it
is
not
the
king
s
own
levies
that
have
fought
the
rebels
it
is
the
french
sent
across
the
pyrenees
who
have
conquered
every
province
therefore
all
these
regions
belong
not
to
the
king
but
to
the
emperor
by
plain
right
of
conquest
he
intends
for
this
reason
to
regard
the
treaty
of
bayonne
as
null
it
has
never
been
ratified
by
the
spanish
nation
one
only
chance
remains
to
the
king
let
him
prevail
upon
the
cortes
at
cadiz
to
acknowledge
him
as
their
sovereign
and
to
break
with
england
if
that
can
be
done
the
emperor
may
revert
to
his
first
intentions
and
ratify
the
treaty
of
bayonne
except
that
he
must
insist
on
a
rectification
of
frontiers
sufficient
to
give
him
certain
indispensable
positions
presumably
san
sebastian
pampeluna
figueras
rosas
napoleon
to
laforest
ambassador
at
madrid
the
mere
first
rumour
of
his
brother
s
intentions
transmitted
by
almenara
and
the
duke
of
his
ambassadors
ordinary
and
extraordinary
at
paris
drove
joseph
to
despair
the
spanish
nation
he
wrote
is
more
compact
in
its
opinions
its
prejudices
its
national
egotism
than
any
other
people
of
europe
there
are
no
catholics
and
protestants
here
no
new
and
old
spaniards
and
they
will
all
suffer
themselves
to
be
hewn
in
pieces
rather
than
allow
the
realm
to
be
dismembered
what
would
the
inhabitants
of
the
counties
round
london
say
if
they
were
menaced
with
being
declared
no
longer
english
what
would
provençals
or
languedocians
say
if
they
were
told
that
they
were
to
cease
to
be
frenchmen
my
only
chance
here
is
to
be
authorized
to
announce
that
the
promise
that
spain
should
not
be
dismembered
will
be
kept
if
that
is
granted
and
the
generals
who
have
misbehaved
are
recalled
to
france
all
may
be
repaired
if
not
the
only
honourable
course
for
me
is
to
retire
into
private
life
as
my
conscience
bids
me
and
honour
on
november
after
having
received
more
formal
news
of
the
emperor
s
intentions
from
his
envoys
joseph
declared
that
the
die
was
cast
he
would
return
to
his
castle
of
mortefontaine
or
to
any
other
provincial
abode
in
france
that
he
could
afford
to
purchase
as
soon
as
his
brother
s
resolve
was
made
public
joseph
to
the
queen
of
spain
ducasse
vii
yet
the
crisis
never
came
to
a
head
the
annexation
of
the
ebro
provinces
was
never
published
though
private
assurances
of
their
impending
fate
were
laid
before
the
spanish
ministers
and
the
king
what
caused
the
emperor
to
hesitate
when
all
was
prepared
the
answer
may
be
found
in
his
dispatch
to
laforest
on
november
i
need
hardly
warn
you
he
writes
that
these
insinuations
the
ultimatum
to
the
king
are
to
be
made
only
on
condition
that
the
french
army
has
entered
lisbon
and
that
the
english
have
taken
to
their
and
again
the
emperor
is
acting
in
sincerity
if
in
reality
the
capture
of
lisbon
and
an
offer
from
the
cabinet
of
madrid
might
possibly
decide
the
rebels
to
treat
his
majesty
might
consent
it
was
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
which
saved
king
joseph
from
abdication
and
spain
from
dismemberment
the
evacuation
of
portugal
by
wellington
was
the
indispensable
preliminary
to
the
carrying
out
of
the
great
annexation
scheme
its
completion
was
deferred
till
the
ominous
silence
of
masséna
should
be
ended
by
a
triumphant
dispatch
proclaiming
the
capture
of
lisbon
since
that
dispatch
never
came
napoleon
kept
postponing
his
ultimatum
then
followed
the
news
delivered
at
paris
by
foy
on
november
showing
that
masséna
had
been
brought
to
a
standstill
even
then
the
emperor
s
plan
was
kept
back
not
abandoned
it
was
not
till
the
army
of
portugal
had
recoiled
in
despair
and
disarray
to
the
banks
of
the
coa
that
napoleon
abandoned
his
cherished
scheme
and
consented
to
treat
with
his
brother
on
reasonable
terms
but
joseph
s
visit
to
paris
in
the
spring
of
and
its
consequences
belong
to
another
chapter
of
this
history
it
must
suffice
here
to
point
out
that
he
spent
all
the
winter
of
in
a
state
of
mental
anguish
expecting
every
day
to
be
forced
to
publish
his
abdication
and
meanwhile
living
a
life
of
shifts
and
worries
selling
his
last
silver
plate
to
feed
his
courtiers
and
exchanging
an
endless
correspondence
of
remonstrances
and
insinuations
with
soult
and
the
commanders
of
the
military
governments
of
the
north
even
from
the
military
point
of
view
he
did
not
consider
himself
safe
the
empecinado
and
other
guerrillero
chiefs
carried
their
incursions
up
to
the
very
gates
of
madrid
and
la

which
by
the
emperor
s
orders
much

been
withdrawn

meanwhile
the
other
government
which
claimed
to
be
the
legal
representative
of
spanish
nationality
was
even
more
truly
aux
the
cortes
had
assembled
at
cadiz
where
the
booming
of
the
french
cannon
was
perpetually
heard
and
where
an
occasional
shell
from
villantroys
celebrated
mortars
would
plump
harmlessly
into
the
sand
of
the
peninsula
or
the
outskirts
of
the
town
itself
the
cortes
had
opened
its
sessions
on
september
though
less
than
half
its
members
had
assembled
the
difficulty
of
collecting
them
had
been
very
great
since
all
had
to
arrive
by
sea
and
many
had
to
come
from
regions
very
remote
such
as
asturias
galicia
or
catalonia
the
assembly
could
not
be
called
satisfactory
or
representative
the
scheme
drawn
up
for
its
election
by
the
commission
that
had
sat
in
the
preceding
winter
was
complicated
there
was
to
be
a
deputy
for
every
souls
throughout
spain
but
the
form
of
selection
was
indirect
the
villages
chose
each
one
primary
elector
the
primary
electors
met
at
the
chief
town
of
the
district
to
choose
a
second
body
of
secondary
electors
the
secondary
electors
chose
a
final
committee
for
the
whole
province
provincial
and
these
last
aided
by
the
governor
archbishop
and
intendant
of
the
province
nominated
the
deputies
but
this
complicated
system
could
only
work
in
the
regions
which
were
in
the
hands
of
the
patriots
only
valencia
murcia
estremadura
the
balearic
isles
and
galicia
were
wholly
free
at
the
moment
in
catalonia
the
capital
barcelona
and
large
tracts
of
the
country
were
occupied
by
the
french
in
the
asturias
of
the
province
were
held
down
by
bonnet
the
two
castiles
andalusia
excepting
cadiz
biscay
navarre
leon
and
aragon
were
entirely
or
almost
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
the
delegates
supposed
to
represent
them
were
either
chosen
in
meetings
of
insurgent
juntas
lurking
in
some
remote
fastness
or
where
even
this
semblance
of
local
election
was
not
possible
by
nomination
by
the
regency
or
in
wholly
casual
assemblies
of
the
natives
of
those
districts
who
chanced
to
be
in
cadiz
at
the
time
the
representatives
of
madrid
for
example
were
chosen
in
this
fashion
by
the
body
of
exiles
from
that
city
meeting
in
the
spacious
courtyard
of
a
large
public
building
the
result
of
this
informal
and
irregular
method
of
choice
was
that
many
provinces
purported
to
be
represented
by
deputies
who
had
no
real
local
influence
therein
but
had
chanced
to
commend
themselves
to
the
insurgent
juntas
or
to
the
persons
in
some
cases
a
mere
handful
who
happened
to
have
fled
from
that
particular
region
to
cadiz
it
is
said
that
the
very
names
and
much
more
the
persons
of
a
good
many
of
the
deputies
were
absolutely
unknown
to
their
supposed
constituents
most
of
all
was
this
the
case
with
the
members
of
the
cortes
who
were
supposed
to
represent
spanish
america
it
had
been
decreed
by
the
late
central
junta
that
the
colonies
formed
an
integral
part
of
the
spanish
monarchy
and
were
therefore
entitled
to
representation
but
the
modest
number
of
members
allotted
to
them
were
elected
at
cadiz
by
a
committee
of
americans
nominated
by
the
regency
from
those
who
happened
to
be
resident
in
that
town
most
of
the
deputies
were
out
of
touch
with
the
people
beyond
the
seas
of
whom
they
were
theoretically
the
delegates
argüelles
de
this
fact
was
specially
unfortunate
when
the
first
symptoms
of
discontent
and
sedition
in
buenos
ayres
mexico
and
the
caraccas
had
begun
to
show
themselves
though
few
realized
it
as
yet
the
insurrection
of
spanish
america
was
just
about
to
break
forth
the
least
foreseen
of
all
the
results
of
napoleon
s
aggressions
in
old
spain
was
that
the
colonies
which
had
been
called
upon
to
take
their
part
in
the
national
war
against
the
french
and
had
been
promised
a
share
in
the
administration
of
the
empire
should
accept
the
show
of
freedom
and
equality
that
was
offered
in
a
serious
spirit
the
americans
demanded
that
they
should
no
longer
be
treated
as
subjects
and
tributaries
of
the
mother
country
but
recognized
as
possessing
rights
and
interests
of
their
own
which
must
be
taken
into
consideration
when
the
general
governance
of
the
dominions
of
ferdinand
vii
was
in
question
and
these
rights
and
interests
included
not
only
a
claim
to
such
as
other
spanish
provinces
possessed
but
a
demand
that
their
commercial
and
economic
needs
should
no
longer
be
subordinated
to
the
convenience
of
the
mother
country
the
colonies
could
not
see
why
the
monopoly
of
all
their
trade
should
be
left
in
the
hands
of
the
merchants
of
old
spain
they
wished
to
traffic
on
their
own
account
with
great
britain
and
the
united
states
this
claim
was
one
which
no
inhabitant
of
old
spain
could
view
with
equanimity
the
monopoly
of
south
american
commerce
had
always
been
believed
to
be
the
most
essential
item
in
the
greatness
of
the
realm
it
had
been
preserved
almost
as
strictly
in
the
eighteenth
century
as
in
the
seventeenth
or
sixteenth
the
old
which
gave
great
britain
a
minute
share
in
that
commerce
had
been
conceived
to
be
a
humiliation
and
a
disgrace
to
the
king
who
granted
it
spain
had
fought
more
than
once
to
preserve
the
american
monopoly
it
is
only
necessary
to
allude
to
the
war
of
jenkins
s
ear
to
show
what
she
was
prepared
to
face
in
its
defence
and
now
when
the
mother
country
was
in
such
desperate
straits
the
questions
of
american
and
american
trade
were
raised
in
the
crudest
form
great
britain
had
provoked
the
distrust
of
her
spanish
allies
by
many
of
her
acts
even
when
they
were
done
in
good
faith
and
with
no
ulterior
motive
but
the
most
irritating
of
all
was
the
request
which
had
been
already
made
more
than
once
in
a
tentative
fashion
for
a
measure
of
free
trade
with
south
america
wellington
had
recommended
that
the
point
should
not
be
pressed
when
spain
was
in
her
extremity
but
it
was
inevitable
that
since
nearly
all
british
subjects
and
nearly
all
americans
were
desirous
to
see
the
old
barriers
removed
the
question
should
crop
up
again
and
again
the
opening
of
the
american
trade
was
the
only
return
that
spain
could
make
for
the
aid
that
great
britain
had
now
been
giving
her
for
more
than
two
years
of
war
when
canning
in
wrote
that
in
questions
of
commerce
any
proper
occasion
must
be
used
to
recommend
a
more
enlarged
and
liberal
policy
than
has
hitherto
been
acted
upon
in
spain
it
is
easy
to
see
what
was
in
his
mind
the
ministers
in
power
in
were
mostly
of
the
same
opinion
but
to
ask
for
free
trade
with
america
in
the
year
when
hidalgo
was
making
his
first
rising
in
mexico
and
the
on
the
rio
de
la
plata
were
quietly
substituting
municipal
for
the
ancient
autocratic
rule
of
their
viceroys
was
to
provoke
acute
suspicion
in
great
britain
had
backed
miranda
and
other
colonial
separatists
either
with
the
hope
of
getting
a
footing
for
herself
in
south
america
or
at
least
with
that
of
establishing
republics
which
would
grant
her
all
the
commercial
privileges
that
she
asked
the
successive
spanish
governments
of
could
never
convince
themselves
that
the
scheme
had
been
completely
dropped
and
mistook
british
demands
for
open
trade
with
america
for
a
desire
to
sever
the
discontented
colonies
from
their
mother
country
the
most
unpopular
act
of
the
regency
of
was
their
decree
of
may
issued
as
all
spaniards
held
in
base
subservience
to
their
allies
which
had
granted
england
and
portugal
a
certain
limited
right
of
exchanging
their
products
with
the
colonies
on
paying
the
heavy
of
ten
and
a
half
or
fifteen
and
a
half
per
cent
so
great
was
the
cry
raised
against
it
in
cadiz
that
the
regency
was
cowardly
enough
to
cancel
it
on
june
under
the
pretext
that
it
had
not
been
ratified
in
a
session
at
which
all
its
members
were
present
for
details
see
schepeler
iii
the
goods
must
also
be
carried
in
spanish
vessels
so
the
grant
was
not
a
very
liberal
one
but
it
was
not
the
american
question
alone
which
lay
as
a
source
of
danger
before
the
cortes
nor
was
it
the
american
deputies
alone
who
misrepresented
their
constituents
speaking
in
general
it
may
be
said
that
the
whole
assembly
showed
a
disproportionate
number
of
liberals
when
the
relative
numbers
of
the
democratic
and
the
conservative
parties
throughout
spain
were
taken
into
consideration
the
events
of
the
next
ten
years
were
to
show
that
the
as
their
opponents
called
them
were
really
in
a
majority
in
the
whole
and
in
many
towns
if
that
had
not
been
so
ferdinand
vii
could
not
have
restored
autocratic
government
with
such
ease
when
the
peninsular
war
was
over
reactionaries
of
the
blackest
dye
who
would
have
liked
to
restore
the
inquisition
and
would
have
put
back
the
press
into
the
shackles
which
it
had
endured
before
were
probably
in
a
clear
majority
in
the
nation
the
clerical
interest
was
in
many
ways
the
mainstay
of
the
war
of
independence
and
the
clergy
with
very
few
exceptions
would
gladly
have
gone
back
to
the
system
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
majority
of
the
old
official
class
sympathized
with
them
and
the
peasantry
were
almost
everywhere
under
their
control
on
the
other
hand
the
liberals
if
all
shades
of
them
were
reckoned
together
had
a
clear
majority
in
the
cortes
both
because
the
regions
which
were
properly
represented
in
that
assembly
chanced
to
be
those
in
which
they
were
most
numerous
and
because
they
had
secured
a
disproportionate
number
of
the
seats
belonging
to
the
lost
provinces
which
had
been
filled
up
by
more
or
less
fictitious
elections
within
the
walls
of
cadiz
that
town
itself
was
the
least
conservative
place
in
spain
and
the
refugees
who
had
served
as
electors
because
they
happened
to
be
on
the
spot
were
not
drawn
from
the
bulk
of
the
population
were
neither
priests
nor
peasants
but
mainly
came
from
those
sections
of
the
upper
and
middle
classes
where
liberal
opinions
had
made
more
progress
liberal
clergy
of
the
type
of
the
journalist
leucadio
doblado
were
rare
exceptions
the
cortes
on
the
whole
was
a
democratic
body
spain
on
the
whole
was
reactionary
the
number
of
those
who
hated
napoleon
because
they
regarded
him
as
the
enemy
of
the
church
the
jailer
of
the
pope
and
the
of
old
laws
was
much
greater
than
that
of
those
who
hated
him
because
he
was
the
embodiment
of
autocracy
and
the
foe
of
all
free
intense
national
pride
was
common
to
both
parties
and
all
could
unite
against
a
foe
whose
aim
was
the
dismemberment
of
spain
but
the
union
was
made
difficult
by
the
fact
that
men
who
had
imbibed
more
or
less
consciously
some
of
the
principles
of
had
to
with
men
who
looked
back
on
the
régime
of
philip
ii
as
a
golden
age
i
can
see
no
prospect
of
liberty
behind
the
crowd
of
priests
who
everywhere
stand
foremost
to
take
the
lead
of
our
patriots
i
can
not
look
for
any
direct
advantage
from
the
feeling
which
prompts
the
present
resistance
to
napoleon
as
it
arises
chiefly
from
an
inveterate
attachment
to
the
religious
system
whence
our
present
degradation
takes
source
if
the
course
of
events
enables
us
to
attempt
a
political
reform
it
will
be
by
grafting
the
feeble
shoots
of
liberty
upon
the
stock
of
catholicism
an
experiment
which
has
hitherto
and
must
ever
prove
abortive
wrote
a
desponding
liberal
how
could
the
writer
of
such
words
and
his
friends
work
cordially
in
company
with
such
fanatics
as
the
estremaduran
deputy
who
in
one
of
the
earlier
sessions
of
the
cortes
proposed
the
astonishing
motion
that
in
spite
of
all
that
had
happened
since
the
inquisition
remains
in
full
possession
of
its
ancient
authority
and
can
make
free
use
of
all
the
powers
which
it
has
ever
enjoyed
in
the
past
there
were
others
who
objected
to
the
use
of
the
dangerous
word
constitution
and
even
to
the
phrase
leyes

as
implying
an
authority

when
it
is
remembered
that
the
form
in
which
the

had
been

was
new
and
experimental
that
the

had

that
no

member
was
accustomed
to
parliamentary
usages
that
the

views
of
the
most
divergent
kinds
the
wonder
is
not
that
the
assembly
displayed
many
weaknesses

that
it
did
no

a
pessimistic
frame

feared

to

reforms

by

they
had
given
no
mandate

to
take
such
changes
into

for
neither
the

right

no

prevent

opened
and
then
withdrew
after
a
brief
speech
by
the
senior
regent

bade
the

was
ordered
to
make

to

recognizing
the
sovereignty
of
the

represented
by
the
deputies
of

with
an
ill
grace
all
save
the
bishop
of

who
misliked
the
oath
contending
that
its
terms
spoke
of
the
nation
as
being
sovereign
in
its
own
right
without
consideration
of
the
king

indefeasible
majesty
he
would
not

and
so
vacated
his
place
he
did
not
lose
much
by
his
early
dismissal
for
on
october
the
cortes
abruptly
deposed
his
four
colleagues
castaños
lardizabal
saavedra
and
escaño
and
replaced
them
by
a
new
regency
of
three
members
these
were
joaquim
blake
that
most
unlucky
of
generals
admiral
cisgar
then
commanding
the
cartagena
squadron
who
passed
as
an
able
administrator
and
an
obscure
naval
captain
pedro
agar
of
whom
little
was
known
save
that
he
was
american
born
and
might
therefore
theoretically
represent
the
colonies
the
change
in
regents
was
decidedly
for
the
worse
as
far
as
character
and
ability
went
apparently
the
cortes
were
jealous
of
an
administration
whose
power
was
older
than
their
own
and
had
not
originally
been
created
by
them
they
wished
to
have
an
executive
more
entirely
dependent
on
themselves
some
of
the
liberals
pretended
that
the
old
regents
were
plotting
to
hold
a
sort
of
pride
s
purge
of
the
cortes
and
to
restore
themselves
to
power
but
of
this
no
proof
was
ever
given
considering
the
difficult
times
which
they
had
passed
through
and
their
if
rather
feeble
attempt
to
serve
the
state
castaños
and
his
colleagues
deserved
a
better
fate
than
arbitrary
dismissal
without
thanks
and
with
a
tacit
accusation
of
treason
laid
to
their
charge

illogically

abolished

they
passed
a

heat
and
a
considerable
amount
of
eloquence
on
many
other
points
during
the
early
days
of
the
junta
the
subjects
of
debate
were
generally
constitutional
occasionally
financial
it
was
worthy
to
be
observed
that
the
two
topics
on
which
all
the
deputies
rallied
together
were
the
question
of
opposition
to
the
french
and
the
question
of
the
defence
of
their
own
sovereign
rights
even
the
majority
of
the
would
join
with
the
liberals
whenever
any
doubt
was
raised
with
regard
to
the
right
of
the
cortes
to
arrogate
to
itself
the
title
of
majesty
or
the
attributes
of
supreme
power
when
for
example
the
bishop
of
orense
refused
to
take
the
oath
of
obedience
several
clericals
of
most
reactionary
views
took
part
against
him
and
when
a
few
weeks
later
the
marqués
del
palacio
named
as
a
during
the
absence
of
blake
also
displayed
reluctance
to
swear
to
the
same
form
on
similar
grounds
he
did
not
receive
the
report
that
he
had
expected
from
the
reactionaries
indeed
he
was
put
under
arrest
for
some
time
without
as
it
seems
any
attempt
to
protect
him
being
made
by
the
like
the
bishop
of
orense
he
ended
by
swallowing
his
scruples
and
accepting
the
prescribed
formula
toreno
ii
pp
a
similar
desire
to
assert
its
own
absolute
supremacy
impelled
the
cortes
to
refuse
to
countenance
two
dynastic
intrigues
which
came
from
different
quarters
the
eldest
daughter
of
charles
iv
carlotta
princess
of
the
brazils
and
wife
of
the
regent
joão
of
portugal
was
the
nearest
of
kin
to
ferdinand
vii
who
had
escaped
napoleon
s
claws
in
she
was
of
opinion
that
she
had
a
good
right
to
expect
the
regency
during
her
brother
s
captivity
at
valençay
and
her
agents
repeatedly
urged
her
claims
both
during
the
days
of
the
first
regency
and
after
the
cortes
had
assembled
the
portuguese
ambassador
naturally
lent
them
his
aid
and
she
had
spanish
partisans
though
few
of
them
were
persons
of
good
reputation
yet
by
constant
persuasion
and
promises
carlotta
s
representatives
actually
succeeded
in
inducing
great
numbers
of
the
deputies
to
pledge
themselves
to
push
her
interests
it
is
said
that
at
one
time
or
another
a
full
half
of
the
members
had
given
the
intriguers
encouragement
but
to
do
this
and
to
make
a
formal
attempt
to
pass
a
decree
conferring
the
regency
on
her
were
very
different
things
when
overt
action
was
urged
by
her
agents
or
their
partisans
in
the
cortes
nothing
came
of
the
attempt
the
assembly
was
naturally
unwilling
to
surrender
its
own
sovereignty
and
to
introduce
a
court
and
its
intrigues
into
cadiz
it
must
be
added
that
joão
of
portugal
had
no
liking
for
his
wife
s
scheme
that
wellington
saw
its
disadvantages
and
that
the
great
bulk
of
the
spaniards
would
have
resented
the
whole
affair
as
a
portuguese
intrigue
if
it
had
ever
been
laid
before
the
nation
as
a
definite
proposal
see
wellington
to
henry
wellesley
if
the
princess
of
the
brazils
be
the
person
appointed
regent
the
court
will
be
inundated
with
intriguers
of
all
nations
and
attended
by
other
the
second
dynastic
scheme
which
was
running
its
course
at
this
time
was
engineered
by
another
branch
of
the
spanish
royal
house
the
restless
and
unscrupulous
queen
caroline
of
sicily
could
not
forget
that
if
carlotta
of
portugal
was
the
nearest
relative
of
the
captive
king
yet
her
husband
ferdinand
was
his
nearest
male
kinsman
save
the
princes
in
napoleon
s
hands
she
availed
herself
of
this
fact
to
urge
that
one
of
her
children
would
be
a
very
suitable
person
to
be
entrusted
with
power
in
spain
and
thought
of
her
younger
son
prince
leopold
as
a
possible
candidate
for
the
regency
but
since
he
had
not
the
necessary
reputation
or
age
the
queen
soon
fell
back
upon
her
louis
philippe
duke
of
orleans
the
exiled
son
of
the
infamous
philippe
égalité
he
had
not
only
a
good
military
record
for
his
services
at
jemappes
and
elsewhere
in
the
early
belgian
campaigns
but
was
universally
known
as
a
man
of
ability
unfortunately
he
had
fought
on
the
republican
side
in
a
thing
hard
to
forget
and
certain
to
cause
suspicion
and
his
ability
was
always
displayed
for
purposes
of
and
savoured
of
unscrupulousness
nevertheless
orleans
had
already
made
overtures
to
the
old
regency
in
the
spring
of
and
had
been
promised
by
them
a
command
on
the
borders
of
catalonia
they
had
failed
to
keep
the
pledge
and
he
now
appeared
at
cadiz
and
wished
to
present
himself
before
the
cortes
and
plead
his
cause
he
took
small
profit
thereby
for
the
assembly
regarded
him
and
his
relatives
as
suspicious
persons
refused
to
give
him
an
audience
when
he
presented
himself
before
its
doors
and
politely
but
firmly
insisted
that
he
should
return
to
sicily
in
a
few
days
an
order
which
he
was
forced
to
obey
whether
it
was
that
he
was
a
frenchman
though
a
bourbon
or
whether
it
was
that
he
had
once
been
a
republican
though
he
had
ceased
to
be
one
or
whether
it
was
that
he
was
a
prince
of
the
royal
house
and
therefore
distasteful
to
the
cortes
who
were
secretly
inclined
to
democratic
views
the
majority
viewed
him
with
disfavour
on
october
he
set
sail
for
palermo
see
galiano
quoted
by
arteche
ix
at
the
end
of
we
leave
the
cortes
still
indulging
in
fiery
constitutional
debates
still
busy
in
asserting
its
own
supreme
power
and
curbing
many
attempts
at
in
the
new
regency
which
it
had
created
with
the
english
government
it
was
not
on
the
best
of
terms
though
it
decreed
the
erection
of
a
statue
to
george
iii
as
the
friend
and
deliverer
of
spain
a
monument
which
it
need
hardly
be
said
was
never
erected
it
was
very
slow
to
seek
or
follow
the
advice
of
the
allied
power
it
clamoured
for
subsidies
but
refused
the
opening
of
the
south
american
trade
the
only
return
that
could
be
given
for
them
money
in
hard
gold
or
silver
great
britain
could
no
longer
supply
for
the
years
were
those
when
the
of
the
bank
were
our
sole
currency
cash
had
almost
disappeared
and
could
only
be
procured
by
offering
six
pounds
or
more
in
notes
for
five
guineas
but
the
spaniards
did
not
want
paper
but
gifts
or
loans
in
gold
or
silver
they
got
no
more
of
the
precious
metals
great
britain
had
none
to
spare
and
found
it
almost
impossible
even
to
procure
dollars
to
pay
wellington
s
army
in
portugal
all
that
was
given
after
was
arms
and
munitions
of
war
english
observers
in
the
peninsula
were
not
well
pleased
with
the
first
months
of
the
rule
of
the
cortes
the
natural
course
of
all
popular
assemblies
wrote
wellington
to
his
brother
henry
wellesley
now
minister
at
cadiz
and
of
the
spanish
cortes
among
others
is
to
adopt
democratic
principles
and
to
vest
all
the
powers
of
the
state
in
their
own
body
this
assembly
must
take
care
that
they
do
not
run
in
that
tempting
course
as
the
wishes
of
the
nation
are
decidedly
for
monarchy
inclination
to
any
other
form
of
government
would
immediately
deprive
them
of
the
confidence
of
the
people
and
they
would
become
a
worse
government
and
more
impotent
because
more
numerous
than
the
old
central
a
few
weeks
later
he
doubted
whether
even
a
regency
under
carlotta
of
portugal
with
all
its
disadvantages
would
not
be
better
than
mere
democracy
wellington
to
henry
wellesley
from
cartaxo
vaughan
on
the
spot
at
cadiz
gave
quite
a
different
view
of
the
situation
but
one
equally
unfavourable
to
the
cortes
as
a
governing
power
it
is
full
of
priests
who
united
with
the
catalans
are
for
preserving
the
old
routine
and
adverse
to
everything
that
can
give
energy
and
vigour
to
the
operation
of
government
fanaticism
and
personal
interest
direct
their
opinions
be
assured
that
the
cortes
is
as
at
present
constituted
anything
but
revolutionary
or
jacobinical
if
there
is
not
soon
some
new
spirit
infused
into
it
it
will
become
an
overgrown
junta
meddling
with
every
paltry
detail
of
police
and
neglecting
the
safety
of
the
country
and
the
regency
will
be
content
to
reign
very
badly
over
cadiz
and
the
isla
charles
vaughan
to
charles
stuart
there
was
much
truth
in
both
these
verdicts
though
vaughan
underrated
the
force
of
in
driving
a
popular
assembly
to
claim
all
power
for
itself
while
wellington
underrated
the
of
clerical
conservatism
which
was
the
restraint
upon
that
tendency
both
were
right
in
asserting
that
whatever
the
cortes
might
be
the
mass
of
the
nation
had
no
wish
to
set
out
on
the
path
of
jacobinism
they
both
perceived
the
danger
that
the
cortes
might
turn
itself
into
a
constitutional
debating
society
and
at
the
same
time
prevent
any
really
efficient
executive
from
being
established
such
was
its
actual
fate
except
that
spain
now
possessed
a
governing
authority
which
with
all
its
faults
had
infinitely
more
pretension
to
claim
a
legal
mandate
from
the
people
than
any
of
its
predecessors
the
situation
was
not
greatly
changed
from
the
military
point
of
view
as
we
shall
see
in
the

the
aspect
of
the

in
no

blunders
