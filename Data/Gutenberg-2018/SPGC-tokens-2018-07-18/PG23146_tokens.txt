a
grave
by

illustrated
by

there
nothing
wrong
with
dying
it
just
has
ever
had
the
proper
sales
pitch
it
all
began
when
the
new
bookkeeping
machine
of
a
large
midwestern
coffin
manufacturer
slipped
a
cog
or
blew
a
transistor
or
something
it
was
fantastic
that
the
error
one
of
two
decimal
places
should
enjoy
a
straight
run
of
okays
human
and
mechanical
clear
down
the
line
but
when
the
figures
clacked
out
at
the
last
station
there
it
was
the
figures
were
now
sacred
immutable
and
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
president
of
the
concern
or
the
chairman
of
the
board
would
have
dared
question
them
even
if
either
of
those
two
gentlemen
had
been
in
town
as
for
the
advertising
manager
the
last
thing
he
wanted
to
do
was
question
them
he
carried
them
they
were
the
budget
for
the
coming
fiscal
year
into
his
office
staggering
a
little
on
the
way
and
dropped
dazedly
into
his
chair
they
showed
the
budget
for
his
own
department
as
exactly
one
hundred
times
what
he
been
expecting
that
is
to
say
fifty
times
what
he
put
in
for
when
the
initial
shock
began
to
wear
off
his
face
assumed
an
expression
of
intense
thought
in
about
five
minutes
he
leaped
from
his
chair
dashed
out
of
the
office
with
a
shouted
syllable
or
two
for
his
secretary
and
got
his
car
out
of
the
parking
lot
at
home
he
tossed
clothes
into
a
travelling
bag
and
barged
toward
the
door
giving
his
wife
a
quick
kiss
and
an
equally
quick
explanation
he
did
bother
to
call
the
airport
he
meant
to
be
on
the
next
plane
east
and
no
nonsense
about
it
with
one
thing
and
another
the
economy
had
been
exactly
in
overdrive
that
year
and
predictions
for
the
christmas
season
were
gloomy
early
retail
figures
bore
them
out
gift
buying
dribbled
along
feebly
until
thanksgiving
despite
brave
speeches
by
the
administration
the
holiday
passed
more
in
than
in
thankfulness
among
owners
of
businesses
then
on
friday
following
thanksgiving
the
coffin
ads
struck
struck
may
be
too
mild
a
word
people
on
the
streets
saw
crews
at
holiday
rates
slapping
up
posters
on
billboards
the
first
poster
was
a
dilly
a
toothy
and
toothsome
young
woman
leaned
over
a
coffin
she
been
unwrapping
she
smiled
as
if
she
just
received
overtures
of
matrimony
from
an
billionaire
there
was
a
christmas
tree
in
the
background
and
the
coffin
was
appropriately
wrapped
so
was
she
she
looked
as
if
she
had
just
gotten
out
of
bed
or
were
ready
to
get
into
it
for
amorous
young
men
and
some
not
so
young
the
message
was
plain
the
motto
gift
that
will
last
more
than
a
seemed
hardly
to
the
point
those
at
home
were
assailed
on
tv
with
a
variety
of
bright
and
clever
skits
of
the
same
import
some
of
them
hinted
that
if
the
young
lady
gratitude
were
really
precipitous
and
the
bedroom
too
far
away
the
coffin
might
be
comfy
of
course
the
more
settled
elements
of
the
population
were
not
neglected
for
the
older
married
man
there
was
a
blow
directly
between
the
eyes
you
want
your
widow
to
be
and
for
the
spinster
without
immediate
hopes
dreamt
i
was
caught
dead
without
my
virginform
casket
newspapers
magazines
and
every
other
medium
added
to
the
assault
never
letting
it
cool
it
was
the
most
horrendous
campaign
for
sheer
concentration
that
had
ever
battered
at
the
public
mind
the
public
reeled
blinked
shook
its
head
to
clear
it
gawked
and
rushed
out
to
buy
christmas
was
not
going
to
be
a
failure
after
all
department
store
managers
who
had
grudgingly
and
under
strong
sales
pressure
made
space
for
a
single
coffin
somewhere
at
the
rear
of
the
store
now
rushed
to
the
telephones
like
touts
with
a
direct
pronouncement
from
a
horse
everyone
who
possibly
could
got
into
the
act
grocery
supermarkets
put
in
casket
departments
the
association
of
pharmaceutical
retailers
who
felt
they
had
some
claim
to
priority
tried
to
get
court
injunctions
to
keep
caskets
out
of
service
stations
but
were
unsuccessful
because
the
judges
were
all
out
buying
caskets
beauty
parlors
showed
real
ingenuity
in
merchandising
roads
and
streets
clogged
with
delivery
trucks
rented
trailers
and
whatever
else
could
haul
a
coffin
the
stock
market
went
completely
mad
strikes
were
declared
and
settled
within
hours
congress
was
called
into
session
early
the
president
got
authority
to
ration
lumber
and
other
materials
suddenly
in
supply
state
laws
were
passed
against
cremation
under
heavy
lobby
pressure
a
new
racket
called
boxjacking
blossomed
overnight
the
advertising
manager
who
had
put
the
thing
over
had
been
fighting
with
all
the
formidable
weapons
of
his
breed
to
make
his
plant
managers
build
up
a
stockpile
they
had
but
it
went
like
a
toupee
in
a
wind
tunnel
competitive
coffin
manufacturers
were
caught
napping
but
by
wednesday
after
thanksgiving
they
along
with
the
original
one
were
on
a
hour
basis
still
only
a
fraction
of
the
demand
could
be
met
jet
passenger
planes
were
stripped
of
their
seats
supplied
with
yankee
gold
and
sent
to
plunder
the
world
of
its
coffins
it
might
be
supposed
that
christmas
goods
other
than
caskets
would
take
a
bad
dumping
that
was
not
so
such
was
the
upsurge
of
prosperity
and
such
was
the
shortage
of
coffins
that
nearly
everything
with
a
few
exceptions
enjoyed
the
biggest
season
on
record
on
christmas
eve
the
frenzy
slumped
to
a
crawl
though
on
christmas
morning
there
were
still
optimists
out
prowling
the
empty
stores
the
nation
sat
down
to
breathe
mostly
it
sat
on
coffins
because
there
was
space
in
the
living
rooms
for
any
other
furniture
there
was
hardly
an
individual
in
the
united
states
who
did
have
in
case
of
sudden
sharp
pains
in
the
chest
several
boxes
to
choose
from
as
for
the
rest
of
the
world
it
had
better
not
die
just
now
or
it
would
be
literally
a
case
of
dust
to
dust
illustration
of
course
everyone
expected
a
doozy
of
a
slump
after
christmas
but
our
advertising
manager
who
by
now
was
of
course
sales
manager
and
first
vice
president
also
was
settling
for
any
been
a
frustrated
victim
of
his
choice
of
industries
for
so
many
years
that
now
with
his
teeth
in
something
he
was
going
to
give
it
the
old
bite
he
gave
people
a
short
breathing
spell
to
arrange
their
coffin
payments
and
move
the
presents
out
of
the
front
rooms
then
late
in
january
his
new
campaign
came
down
like
a
within
a
week
everyone
saw
quite
clearly
that
his
christmas
models
were
now
obsolete
the
coffin
became
the
new
status
symbol
the
auto
industry
was
of
course
demolished
even
people
who
had
enough
money
to
buy
a
new
car
were
going
to
trade
in
the
old
one
and
let
the
new
one
stand
out
in
the
rain
the
garages
were
full
of
coffins
petroleum
went
along
with
autos
though
there
were
those
who
whispered
knowingly
that
the
same
people
merely
moved
over
into
the
new
industry
it
was
noticeable
that
the
center
of
it
became
detroit
a
few
trucks
and
buses
were
still
being
built
but
that
was
all
some
of
the
new
caskets
were
true
works
of
art
others
well
there
was
variety
compact
models
appeared
in
which
the
occupant
feet
were
to
be
doubled
up
alongside
his
ears
one
manufacturer
pushed
a
circular
model
claiming
that
by
all
the
laws
of
nature
the
foetal
position
was
the
only
right
one
at
the
other
extreme
were
virtual
houses
ornate
and
lavishly
equipped
possibly
the
largest
of
all
was
the
model
triangular
with
graduated
recesses
for
father
mother
eight
children
plus
two
playmates
and
in
the
far
corner
beyond
the
baby
the
cat
the
slump
was
over
still
economists
swore
that
the
new
boom
last
either
they
reckoned
without
the
advertising
manager
whose
eyes
gleamed
brighter
all
the
time
people
already
had
coffins
which
they
polished
and
kept
on
display
sometimes
in
the
new
being
added
to
houses
the
advertising
manager
reasoning
was
direct
and
to
the
point
he
must
get
people
to
use
the
coffins
and
now
he
had
all
the
money
to
work
with
that
he
could
use
the
new
note
was
woven
in
so
gradually
that
it
is
not
easy
to
put
a
finger
on
any
one
ad
and
say
it
began
here
one
of
the
first
was
surely
the
one
showing
a
tattooed
smiling
young
man
with
his
chin
thrust
out
manfully
lying
in
a
coffin
he
was
and
likable
not
too
rugged
for
the
to
identify
with
and
he
oozed
even
though
obviously
dead
virility
at
every
pore
he
was
probably
the
corpse
since
richard
the
neither
must
one
overlook
the
singing
commercials
possibly
the
catchiest
of
these
a
really
cute
little
thing
was
achieved
by
jazzing
up
the
funeral
march
it
started
gradually
and
it
was
all
so
that
few
saw
it
as
suicide
began
having
parties
some
of
their
elders
protested
a
little
but
adults
were
taking
it
up
too
the
tired
the
unappreciated
the
ill
and
the
lay
down
in
growing
numbers
and
expired
a
black
market
in
poisons
operated
for
a
little
while
but
soon
pinched
out
such
was
the
pressure
of
persuasion
that
few
needed
artificial
aids
the
boxes
very
comfortable
people
just
closed
their
eyes
and
exited
smiling
the
beatniks
who
had
their
own
models
of
coffin
mouldy
scroungy
and
without
lids
since
the
beatniks
insisted
on
being
seen
placed
their
boxes
on
the
grant
avenue
in
san
francisco
they
died
with
highly
intellectual
expressions
and
eventually
were
washed
by
the
gentle
rain
of
course
there
were
voices
shouting
calamity
when
are
there
but
in
the
long
run
and
not
a
very
long
one
at
that
they
availed
naught
it
is
hard
to
imagine
the
reactions
of
the
rest
of
the
world
so
let
us
imagine
a
few
the
communist
block
immediately
gave
its
stamp
of
disapproval
denouncing
the
movement
as
a
filthy
capitalist
imperialist
pig
plot
red
china
which
had
been
squabbling
with
russia
for
some
time
about
a
matter
of
method
screamed
for
immediate
war
russia
exposed
this
as
patent
stupidity
saying
that
if
the
capitalists
wanted
to
die
warring
upon
them
would
only
help
them
china
surreptitiously
tried
out
the
thing
as
an
answer
to
excess
population
and
found
it
good
it
also
appealed
to
the
melancholy
facet
of
russian
nature
besides
after
pondering
for
several
days
the
red
bloc
decided
it
could
not
afford
to
fall
behind
in
anything
so
it
started
its
own
program
explaining
with
much
logic
how
it
differed
an
elderly
british
philosopher
endorsed
the
movement
on
the
grounds
that
a
temporary
setback
in
evolution
was
preferable
to
facing
up
to
anything
the
free
bloc
the
red
bloc
the
neutral
bloc
and
such
scraps
as
had
been
too
obtuse
to
find
themselves
a
bloc
were
drawn
into
the
whirlpool
in
an
amazingly
short
time
if
in
a
variety
of
ways
in
less
than
two
years
the
world
was
rid
of
most
of
what
had
been
bedeviling
it
oddly
enough
the
country
where
the
movement
began
was
the
last
to
succumb
completely
or
perhaps
it
is
not
so
odd
to
the
world
the
american
casket
industry
had
by
now
almost
completely
automated
and
gravedigging
with
some
interesting
assembly
lines
and
packaging
arrangements
there
still
remained
the
jobs
of
management
and
distribution
the
president
of
general
mortuary
an
ebullient
fellow
affectionately
called
sarcophagus
sam
put
it
well
as
long
as
i
have
a
single
prospective
customer
and
a
single
stockholder
he
said
mangling
a
stogie
and
beetling
his
brows
at
the
one
reporter
who
showed
up
for
the
press
conference
i
try
to
put
him
in
a
coffin
so
i
can
pay
him
a
dividend
finally
though
a
man
who
thought
he
must
be
the
last
living
human
wandered
contentedly
about
the
city
of
denver
looking
for
the
coffin
he
liked
best
he
settled
at
last
upon
a
rich
mahogany
number
with
platinum
trimmings
an
automatic
innerspring
mattress
with
a
built
in
bar
he
climbed
in
drew
himself
a
generous
slug
of
fine
scotch
giggled
as
the
mattress
prodded
him
exploringly
closed
his
eyes
and
sighed
in
solid
comfort
soft
music
played
as
the
lid
closed
itself
from
a
building
nearby
a
swooped
down
cawing
in
raucous
anger
because
it
had
let
its
attention
wander
for
a
moment
it
was
too
late
it
clawed
screaming
at
the
solid
cover
hissed
in
frustration
and
finally
gave
up
it
flapped
into
the
air
again
still
grumbling
it
was
tired
of
living
on
dead
small
rodents
and
coyotes
it
thought
it
would
take
a
swing
over
to
los
angeles
where
the
pickings
were
pretty
good
as
it
moved
westward
over
parched
hills
it
espied
two
black
dots
a
few
miles
to
its
left
it
circled
over
for
a
closer
look
then
grunted
and
went
on
its
way
it
had
seen
before
the
old
prospector
and
his
burro
had
been
in
the
mountains
for
so
long
the
buzzard
had
concluded
they
did
know
to
die
the
prospector
whose
name
was
adams
trudged
behind
his
burro
toward
the
buildings
that
shimmered
in
the
heat
humming
to
himself
now
and
then
or
addressing
some
remark
to
the
beast
when
he
reached
the
outskirts
of
denver
he
realized
something
was
amiss
he
stood
and
gazed
at
the
quiet
scene
nothing
moved
except
some
skinny
packrats
and
a
few
sparrows
foraging
for
grain
among
the
unburied
coffins
tarnation
he
said
to
the
burro
martians
a
piece
of
newspaper
fluttered
in
the
breeze
he
walked
forward
slowly
and
picked
it
up
it
told
him
enough
so
that
he
understood
they
gone
evie
he
said
to
the
burro
all
gone
he
put
his
arm
affectionately
around
her
neck
i
reckon
it
up
to
me
and
you
agin
we
got
to
start
all
over
he
stood
back
and
gazed
at
her
with
mild
reproach
i
shore
hope
they
do
favor
your
side
of
the
house
so
