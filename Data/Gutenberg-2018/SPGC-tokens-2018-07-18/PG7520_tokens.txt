author

the

chapter
i
under
a
noon
sun
the
vast
flat
country
buried
deep
in
snow
lay
like
a
paper
hoop
rimmed
by
the
dark
primeval
forest
its
surface
shone
with
an
unbearable
brightness
as
of
glass
every
crystal
gleaming
and
quivering
with
intense
cold
light
to
the
north
a
single
blunt
low
broke
the
evenness
of
the
horizon
line
hugh
garth
seemed
to
leap
through
paper
like
a
tiny
active
clown
as
he
dropped
down
into
the
small
space
shoveled
clear
in
front
of
his
hidden
cabin
door
the
roof
was
weighted
with
drift
so
that
a
curling
mass
like
the
edge
of
a
wave
about
to
break
hung
low
over
the
eaves
long
icicles
as
thick
as
a
man
s
arm
stretched
from
roof
to
ground
in
a
row
of
twisted
columns
under
this
overhanging
cornice
of
snow
near
the
door
there
was
a
sudden
icy
purple
darkness
as
hugh
plunged
down
into
it
his
face
lost
a
certain
rapt
brightness
and
shadowed
deeply
he
let
slip
the
load
of
fresh
pelts
from
his
back
drew
his
feet
from
the
skis
which
he
stuck
up
on
their
ends
in
the
snow
and
removed
the
fur
cap
from
his
head
and
the
huge
dark
spectacles
from
his
eyes
then
crouching
he
went
in
at
the
low
door
it
stuck
to
its
sill
and
he
cursed
it
all
his
movements
expressed
the
anger
of
frustration
he
slammed
the
door
behind
him
buried
in
drifts
the
cabin
was
dim
even
at
this
bright
hour
of
noon
the
stove
glowed
in
a
corner
with
a
subdued
redness
its
bulging
cheeks
and
round
mouth
dully
scarlet
the
low
room
was
pleasant
to
look
at
for
it
had
the
beauty
of
brown
bark
and
the
salmon
tints
of
old
rough
boards
and
its
furniture
wrought
painstakingly
by
an
unskillful
hand
had
the
charm
of
all
handwork
even
when
unskilled
some
of
the
chairs
were
rudely
carved
one
great
throne
especially
awkward
pretentious
and
carefully
ornate
there
was
too
a
solid
table
in
the
center
of
the
floor
and
on
it
a
woman
was
setting
heavy
earthenware
plates
nicked
and
discolored
she
was
heavy
and
discolored
herself
but
like
the
stove
she
too
seemed
to
have
a
dull
glow
she
was
no
longer
young
but
she
might
still
have
encouraged
her
youthfulness
to
linger
pleasantly
she
was
not
in
the
least
degree
beautiful
but
she
might
have
fostered
a
charm
that
lurked
somewhere
about
her
small
compact
body
and
in
her
square
dark
face
her
hair
of
a
sandy
brown
was
stretched
back
brutally
so
that
her
bright
devoted
eyes
gray
and
honest
eyes
very
beneath
their
brows
lacked
the
usual
softness
and
mystery
of
women
s
eyes
her
lips
were
tight
set
her
chin
held
out
with
an
air
of
dogged
effort
which
seemed
to
possess
no
relation
to
her
mechanical
occupation
yet
to
have
a
strong
habitual
relation
to
her
state
of
mind
she
seemed
in
fact
under
a
shell
of
to
conceal
an
inner
light
like
a
dimly
burning
her
expression
was
dumb
she
moved
about
like
a
indeed
her
stillness
and
stony
were
extraordinary
a
youth
rose
from
a
chair
near
the
stove
and
greeted
hugh
as
he
entered
hullo
he
said
how
many
did
you
get
it
was
the
eager
questioning
of
a
modest
affectionate
boy
who
curbs
his
natural
effervescence
of
greeting
like
a
dog
the
tone
was
astonishingly
young
a
quiet
husky
damn
you
pete
was
snarled
at
him
for
answer
haven
t
you
got
my
boot
mended
yet
the
boot
still
lacking
its
heel
lay
on
the
floor
near
the
stove
and
hugh
now
picked
it
up
and
hurled
it
half
across
the
room
i
have
to
get
out
into
this
ice
chest
of
a
wilderness
and
this
flaming
glare
that
cuts
my
eyeballs
open
and
work
till
the
sweat
freezes
on
my
face
and
then
come
home
to
find
you
loafing
by
the
fire
as
if
you
were
a
house
cat
purring
and
rubbing
against
my
legs
when
i
come
in
he
snarled
thanking
me
for
a
quiet
nap
and
a
saucer
of
milk
eh
you
loafer
what
do
i
keep
you
for
you
gorge
the
bread
and
meat
i
earn
by
sweating
and
freezing
and
you
keep
your
sluggish
mountain
of
bones
covered
a
year
or
two
ago
i
d
have
urged
you
along
with
a
stick
i
used
to
get
some
work
out
of
you
then
but
you
think
you
re
too
big
for
that
now
don
t
you
you
fancy
i
m
afraid
of
your
bigness
eh
well
do
you
want
me
to
try
it
out
what
about
it
during
the
first
part
of
his
brother
s
speech
pete
had
faced
him
but
in
the
middle
he
had
turned
his
back
and
stood
in
front
of
one
of
the
clumsy
windows
he
looked
out
now
at
a
white
wall
of
snow
above
which
shone
the
dazzle
of
the
midday
he
whistled
very
softly
to
himself
and
sank
his
hands
deep
into
the
pockets
of
his
corduroys
he
did
not
answer
the
snarling
question
but
his
wide
quiet
mouth
exquisitely
shaped
ran
into
a
smile
and
a
dimple
deep
and
narrow
cut
into
his
thin
and
ruddy
cheek
between
the
woman
who
went
on
with
her
work
as
though
no
one
had
come
into
the
room
and
the
silent
smiling
youth
hugh
garth
prowled
the
floor
like
a
shadow
thrown
by
a
moving
light
he
was
a
man
of
misshapen
heavy
above
the
waist
and
light
to
meanness
below
a
man
lame
in
one
leg
and
with
an
face
malicious
lined
a
man
who
limped
and
leaped
about
the
room
with
a
fierce
energy
the
while
his
tongue
gifted
with
a
rich
and
resonant
voice
poured
vitriol
upon
the
silence
suddenly
the
woman
spoke
she
turned
back
on
the
threshold
of
the
kitchen
door
through
which
her
work
had
been
taking
her
to
and
fro
during
garth
s
outbreak
her
voice
was
monotonous
and
smothered
it
had
its
share
in
her
unnatural
why
don
t
you
tell
him
to
be
quiet
pete
you
ve
been
chopping
wood
since
daybreak
to
make
up
for
what
he
didn
t
do
last
week
and
you
only
came
in
about
ten
minutes
before
he
did
why
don
t
you
speak
out
you
re
getting
to
be
pretty
close
to
a
man
now
and
it
isn
t
suitable
for
you
to
let
yourself
be
talked
to
that
way
you
always
stand
like
a
fool
and
take
it
from
pete
turned
oh
well
he
answered
i
guess
maybe
he
s
tired
let
up
hugh
will
you
i
ll
finish
your
boot
after
the
hell
you
will
you
ll
do
it
now
venting
on
his
brother
his
anger
at
the
woman
s
intervention
garth
swung
his
misshapen
body
around
the
end
of
the
table
and
thrust
an
elbow
violently
against
pete
s
chest
the
attack
was
so
unexpected
that
pete
staggered
lost
his
balance
and
stepping
down
into
the
shallow
depression
of
a
pebbled
hearth
fell
twisting
his
ankle
the
agony
was
sharp
after
a
dumb
minute
he
lifted
a
white
face
and
pulled
himself
up
one
hand
clutching
the
board
mantel
now
you
ve
done
it
he
said
between
his
teeth
how
will
you
get
your
pelts
to
the
station
now
i
won
t
be
able
to
take
there
ensued
a
dismayed
silence
the
woman
had
come
back
from
the
kitchen
and
stood
with
a
steaming
dish
in
her
hands
after
the
brief
pause
of
consternation
she
set
down
the
dish
and
went
over
to
pete
here
she
said
sit
down
and
let
me
take
off
your
moccasin
and
bathe
your
ankle
before
it
begins
to
hugh
garth
had
seated
himself
in
the
thronelike
chair
at
the
head
of
the
table
his
expression
was
still
defiant
indifferent
and
lordly
come
and
eat
your
dinner
both
of
you
he
commanded
you
ve
had
your
lesson
pete
after
this
i
guess
you
ll
do
what
i
tell
you
to
not
choose
the
work
that
happens
to
suit
your
humor
don
t
for
god
s
sake
baby
him
bella
don
t
start
being
a
grandmother
before
you
ve
ever
been
a
sweetheart
you
re
too
young
for
the
one
even
if
you
re
getting
a
bit
too
old
for
the
other
bella
flushed
deep
and
hot
she
went
to
her
place
and
pete
hobbled
to
his
opposite
his
brother
between
them
the
woman
sat
dyed
deep
in
her
sudden
unaccustomed
wave
of
scarlet
pete
s
whiteness
too
was
stained
in
sympathy
but
hugh
only
chuckled
as
for
the
pelts
he
said
royally
i
ll
take
them
down
bella
looked
slowly
up
you
think
i
don
t
mean
it
i
suppose
hugh
demanded
they
did
not
answer
but
the
eyes
of
the
boy
and
the
woman
met
this
silence
and
this
dumb
exchange
of
understanding
infuriated
garth
he
clinched
his
hands
on
the
carved
arms
of
his
chair
and
leaned
a
little
forward
i
ll
take
the
pelts
myself
he
repeated
boisterously
i
m
not
afraid
to
be
seen
at
the
station
i
m
sick
of
skulking
buried
here
with
talents
in
this
damn
country
spending
my
days
trapping
and
skinning
beasts
to
keep
the
breath
in
our
three
useless
bodies
wouldn
t
death
be
better
for
a
man
like
me
easier
to
bear
fifteen
years
of
it
fifteen
years
my
best
years
he
stared
over
pete
s
head
in
all
that
time
no
beauty
to
feed
my
starved
senses
no
work
for
my
starved
brain
no
hope
for
my
starved
the
woman
and
the
youth
watched
him
still
in
silence
that
fox
i
killed
this
morning
had
a
better
life
to
lose
than
it
wouldn
t
be
safe
for
you
to
go
hugh
said
pete
gently
why
not
watchdog
the
sneer
deepened
the
flush
on
pete
s
face
but
he
answered
with
the
same
gentleness
fixing
his
blue
eyes
on
his
brother
s
because
not
two
months
ago
there
was
a
picture
of
you
tacked
up
in
the
bella
s
face
whitened
and
hugh
s
cheeks
grew
a
shade
more
leaden
months
ago
he
stammered
painfully
but
that
s
not
they
they
ve
given
me
up
they
ve
me
they
i
m
dead
after
fifteen
years
my
god
pete
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
he
pleaded
the
last
with
a
shaken
sort
of
sharpness
in
pitiful
contrast
to
the
bombast
of
the
preceding
speech
i
didn
t
see
the
good
of
telling
you
i
was
waiting
until
this
trip
to
see
if
the
picture
was
still
there
and
maybe
to
ask
some
what
does
it
mean
whispered
bella
it
means
they
ve
some
fresh
reason
to
hunt
me
some
fresh
impulse
god
knows
what
or
why
how
can
we
tell
out
here
buried
in
the
snows
of
fifteen
winters
well
he
struck
his
hands
down
on
the
table
edge
and
stood
up
he
drew
his
mouth
into
a
crooked
smile
and
looked
at
the
other
two
as
a
naughty
child
looks
at
its
doting
but
disapproving
elders
the
smile
transfigured
his
ugliness
i
ve
a
fancy
to
see
that
picture
want
to
be
reminded
of
what
i
looked
like
fifteen
years
ago
i
was
a
handsome
fellow
then
i
m
going
to
take
the
pete
looked
dumbly
up
at
him
his
lips
parted
bella
twisted
her
apron
about
her
hands
both
seemed
to
know
the
hopelessness
of
protest
in
the
same
anxious
dumbness
they
watched
garth
make
ready
for
his
trip
as
he
pulled
his
cap
down
close
about
his
ears
pete
at
last
found
his
voice
hugh
he
began
doubtfully
i
wish
you
wouldn
t
risk
it
we
can
get
on
without
supplies
until
next
when
i
ll
surely
be
all
hold
your
tongue
i
m
going
was
the
answer
i
tell
you
the
spirit
of
adventure
has
me
who
knows
what
i
may
meet
with
out
there
he
flung
back
the
door
and
pointing
with
a
long
arm
stood
silhouetted
against
the
dazzle
beauty
opportunity
danger
hope
death
i
shan
t
shirk
it
this
time
i
ll
meet
whatever
comes
but
he
came
back
a
step
into
the
room
his
harsh
face
melted
to
a
shamefaced
gentleness
his
voice
softened
if
they
get
me
down
there
if
i
come
back
you
two
try
to
think
kindly
of
me
will
you
i
know
what
you
think
of
me
now
i
know
you
won
t
see
me
as
i
am
no
one
but
god
will
ever
do
me
that
kindness
but
you
two
be
easy
with
me
in
your
bella
her
arms
now
twisted
to
their
red
elbows
in
her
apron
took
a
few
stiff
steps
across
the
floor
her
face
was
expressionless
her
eyes
lowered
garth
smiled
at
them
both
and
went
out
shutting
the
door
they
heard
him
singing
as
he
put
on
his
skis
a
hundred
men
were
riding
for
pierre
they
rode
and
rode
but
nothing
could
they
find
they
rode
around
by
moonlight
they
rode
around
by
day
they
rode
and
rode
but
nothing
could
they
find
then
came
the
sharp
scraping
of
his
runners
across
the
surface
of
the
snow
on
a
level
with
the
buried
roof
it
lessened
from
a
hissing
speech
to
a
hissing
whisper
it
sighed
away
bella
sat
down
abruptly
on
a
chair
pulled
in
her
chin
like
an
unhappy
child
her
bosom
lifted
as
though
a
sob
would
force
its
way
out
if
he
doesn
t
come
back
she
murmured
if
he
doesn
t
come
back
she
was
speaking
to
god
chapter
ii
pete
blinked
swallowed
hard
and
began
to
talk
fast
and
hopefully
he
ll
come
back
i
don
t
believe
he
ll
get
halfway
there
bella
he
reassured
the
woman

come
to
his
senses

how
moody

is

over
here
and
doctor
up
my
ankle

a
fuss
over
me

t
that
what
i
used
to
say
he
coaxed
until
at
last
she
came
and
knelt
before
him
and
removed
his
moccasin
and
heavy
woolen
sock
the
strong
white
foot
was
like
marble
but
the
ankle
was
swollen
and
discolored
bella
clicked
her
tongue
he
a
brute
you
know
she
laughed
shortly
since
garth
s
departure
she
had
become
almost
a
human
being
the
look
had
melted
from
her
and
a
sardonic
humor
emerged
her
eyes
cleared
she
could
even
smile
why
do
we
care
so
much
for
him
pete
the
two
of
us
pete
winced
under
her
touch
and
puckered
his
brows
because
he
s
such
a
kid
i
guess
he
s
always
fretting
after
the
don
t
you

get
angry
with
him

in
he
always
was
a
gorgeous
talker
bella
they
used
to
stand
around
and
listen
to
his
yarns
like
kids
to
a
fairy
story
just
the
same
as
you
and
i
do
now
when
we
can
get
him
into
a
good
humor
but
you
know
he
used
to
like
strangers
best
to
talk
to
i
bella
assented
bitterly
she
had
begun
to
clear
the
table
of
its
almost
untouched
meal
because
he
could
put
it
over
better
with
a
stranger
it
isn
t
the
hugh
likes
about
himself
or
pete
had
begun
to
whittle
a
piece
of
wood
he
was
a
charming
figure
slouching
down
in
his
chair
slim
and
graceful
his
shapely
golden
head
ruffled
his
chin
pressed
against
his
chest
his
expression
was
indescribably
sweet
and
boyish
the
shadow
of
anxiety
and
pain
accentuating
a
wistful
if
determined
cheerfulness
he
was
deliberately
entertaining
bella
diverting
her
mind
from
its
agony
of
apprehension
she
saw
through
him
but
like
a
sick
child
she
took
the
entertainment
languidly
now
too
dead
bent
on
the
truth
bella
you
know
you
are
you
re
a
regular
bear
for
the
i
can
t
see
anything
else
she
said
gloomily
things
are
just
so
to
me
no
blinking
he
put
his
head
a
little
to
one
side
and
contemplated
her
what
do
you
see
when
you
look
into
the
bella
the
she
flushed
just
because
you
caught
me
prinking
that
once
well
if
you
had
a
mirror
what
would
you
see
in
it
then
an
ugly
old
woman
there
your
mind
s
just
the
of
hugh
s
he
won
t
see
himself
ugly
and
you
won
t
see
yourself
pretty
i
m
the
only
sane
fellow
in
this
and
you
never
in
your
life
saw
a
pretty
woman
to
remember
her
besides
you
re
too
she
said
it
with
a
tart
sweetness
and
vanished
into
the
kitchen
with
her
departure
pete
s
whittling
ceased
his
hands
fell
slack
and
he
began
to
stare
out
through
the
window
his
anxiety
for
hugh
slipped
imperceptibly
into
a
vague
pondering
over
his
own
youthfulness
that
s
what
those
two
were
always
telling
him
sometimes
savagely
sometimes
tenderly
you
re
too
what
did
it
mean
to
him
anyhow
that
he
was
too
young
a
desolation
from
which
at
times
he
suffered
in
secret
overcame
him
he
was
or
or
his
memory
lied
they
had
never
celebrated
his
birthdays
but
he
was
five
or
six
years
old
when
hugh
had
been
so
suddenly
so
unexplainably
taken
from
the
house
back
there
in
the
little
eastern
college
town
where
they
had
lived
it
was
a
few
months
later
that
bella
cousin
bella
who
worked
at
the
farm
came
for
him
a
furtive
desperate
bella
with
a
bruised
face
a
bella
for
flight
for
a
breaking
of
the
galling
accustomed
ties
of
her
life
for
a
terrible
plunge
into
unknown
adventure
she
had
muttered
to
him
as
she
dressed
him
and
bundled
together
a
few
of
his
belongings
that
they
were
going
to
hugh
only
it
was
another
name
she
used
a
name
since
blotted
from
their
lives
hugh
had
sent
for
them
she
was
the
only
person
in
the
world
that
hugh
could
trust
but
no
one
must
know
where
they
were
going
they
must
be
away
by
the
time
the
man
who
took
charge
of
the
shop
came
back
in
the
morning
pete
remembered
the
journey
he
remembered
the
small
frontier
station
where
they
left
the
train
at
last
he
remembered
that
strange
horizon
streaked
with
dawn
and
his
first
taste
of
the
tangy
heady
air
there
had
been
a
long
long
drive
and
a
parting
with
the
friendly
driver
where
bella
turned
on
to
the
trail
through
the
woods
it
had
been
dim
and
dark
and
terrible
among
the
endless
regiments
of
trees
mazy
and
green
and
altogether
bewildering
and
after
vague
wanderings
he
had
a
disconnected
memory
of
hugh
a
wild
rugged
ragged
bearded
hugh
who
caught
him
up
fiercely
as
though
he
had
an
ogrish
hunger
for
the
feel
of
little
boys
it
was
night
when
they
came
to
hugh
s
for
miles
pete
had
been
carried
in
his
brother
s
arms
bella
had
limped
behind
them
there
had
been
a
ford
he
remembered
the
splashing
water
had
roused
pete
and
he
stayed
awake
afterward
until
he
found
himself
before
a
dancing
fire
of
logs
in
a
queer
dark
house
very
low
with
unglazed
windows
he
remembered
too
that
bella
had
burst
out
crying
that
was
the
queerest
memory
of
them
all
that
crying
of
bella
even
now
he
could
not
understand
exactly
why
she
had
cried
so
then
the
frightened
furtive
life
they
had
all
led
since
the
life
of
scared
wild
things
had
left
its
mark
on
pete
his
fear
for
hugh
now
threw
him
back
into
the
state
of
apprehension
which
had
been
the
atmosphere
of
all
his
little
boyhood
he
had
not
known
then
why
strange
men
were
creatures
to
be
feared
and
shunned
in
fact
he
had
never
been
told
the
reason
for
hugh
s
flight
only
bit
by
bit
he
had
pieced
together
hints
and
vague
allusions
until
he
knew
that
this
strange
embittered
boasting
poet
of
a
brother
had
killed
or
had
been
accused
of
killing
in
his
loyal
boy
mind
hugh
garth
was
promptly
acquitted
it
was
the
world
that
was
wrong
not
hugh
yet
after
all
the
long
years
of
carefulness
he
had
gone
back
to
the
cruelty
of
the
world
like
a
beast
the
boy
s
anxiety
for
his
brother
began
to
prowl
about
the
walls
of
his
mind
he
imagined
hugh
appearing
at
the
he
pictured
the
curious
glances
of
the
indians
and
the
white
natives
this
limping
extravagant
energetic
hugh
with
his
whitening
hair
and
eyebrows
and
flaring
hazel
eyes
with
his
crooked
nose
and
mouth
his
magnificently
desperate
manner
and
his
magnificently
desperate
voice
attention
would
inevitably
fasten
upon
him
anywhere
how
much
more
in
an
empty
land
such
as
this
pete
fancied
the
inquiring
looks
turned
from
the
man
to
the
man
s
posted
picture
it
was
no
longer
a
faithful
likeness
of
course
still
it
was
a
likeness
there
was
no
other
man
in
all
the
world
like
hugh
he
was
made
of
odd
fantastic
fragments
of
parts
physically
mentally
spiritually
it
was
as
if
a
soul
had
seen
itself
in
a
crooked
mirror
and
had
fashioned
a
form
to
match
the
distorted
image
hugh
wouldn
t
couldn
t
force
himself
to
be
inconspicuous
he
would
swagger
he
would
talk
loud
his
big
beautiful
voice
would
challenge
attention
create
an
audience
he
would
have
some
impossible
splendid
tale
to
tell
pete
sat
up
straighter
in
his
chair
gingerly
rearranging
the
ankle
and
lifted
his
blue
and
haunted
eyes
the
eyes
of
the
north
to
the
window
the
dazzle
of
noon
had
faded
to
a
glow
the
short
winter
day
was
nearly
done
there
would
be
a
long
violet
twilight
and
then
the
blaze
of
stars
but
for
his
aching
ankle
pete
would
be
sliding
out
on
soundless
skis
now
poised
for
breathless
flight
down
some
long
slope
now
leaping
fallen
trees
or
buried
ditches
he
spent
half
of
his
wild
young
restlessness
in
such
long
night
runs
when
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
he
outraced
the
stifled
longings
of
his
exiled
youth
but
there
would
be
no
for
several
nights
now
he
was
a
prisoner
and
at
a
time
when
imprisonment
was
hard
to
bear
if
only
there
were
some
way
of
getting
quick
news
of
hugh
why
had
bella
and
he
let
this
thing
happen
why
had
they
stood
helplessly
by
and
allowed
the
rash
fool
to
go
singing
to
his
own
destruction
they
might
have
held
him
by
force
if
not
by
argument
long
enough
to
bring
him
to
his
senses
they
had
been
weak
they
were
always
weak
before
hugh
s
magnetic
strength
always
the
audience
the
following
bella
for
all
her
devastating
tongue
no
less
than
himself
and
hugh
s
liberty
perhaps
his
life
might
be
the
price
of
their
acquiescence
straining
forward
in
his
chair
listening
there
came
to
pete
across
the
silence
the
sound
of
skis
he
rose
and
hopped
to
the
door
flinging
it
wide
he
could
not
see
above
the
top
of
the
drift
which
rose
just
beyond
the
roof
to
a
height
of
nine
or
ten
feet
but
listening
intently
he
thought
he
recognized
a
familiar
slight
unevenness
in
the
sliding
of
the
skis
bella
he
shouted
his
ringing
with
relief
bella
here
s
hugh
he
s
come
bella
was
instantly
at
his
side
they
stood
waiting
in
the
doorway
against
the
violet
sky
darkening
above
the
blue
wall
of
snow
a
bulky
figure
rose
blotting
out
the
light
it
half
slid
half
tumbled
down
upon
them
clumsy
and
shapeless
let
us
in
panted
hugh
let
us
slipping
his
feet
from
the
straps
of
his
skis
he
staggered
past
them
and
they
saw
that
he
was
carrying
a
woman
in
his
arms
chapter
iii
shut
the
door
hugh
whispered
and
laid
his
burden
down
on
a
big
black
near
the
stove
he
knelt
beside
it
he
had
no
eyes
for
anything
else
pete
hobbling
to
him
gazed
curiously
down
and
bella
knelt
opposite
and
drew
away
hugh
s
mackinaw
coat
with
which
he
had
wrapped
his
trove
it
was
not
a
woman
whom
they
looked
down
upon
but
a
girl
and
very
young
perhaps
not
yet
seventeen
a
girl
with
cropped
dark
curly
hair
and
a
face
so
wan
and
blue
and
at
the
same
time
so
scorched
by
the
that
its
exquisiteness
of
feature
was
all
the
more
marked
hugh
s
handkerchief
was
tied
loosely
across
her
eyes
i
heard
her
crying
in
the
snow
he
said
with
ineffable
tenderness
crying
like
a
little
bleating
lamb
with
cold
and
pain
and
hunger
and
fright
the
most
pitiful
thing
in
god
s
cruel
trap
of
life
she
s
blind
pete
gave
a
sharp
exclamation
and
bella
gently
removed
the
handkerchief
the
small
figure
moaned
and
moved
its
head
the
lids
of
her
eyes
were
swollen
and
discolored
echoed
bella
a
bad
case
said
hugh
get
her
some
soup
bella
and
perhaps
hot
water
i
don
t
he
looked
up
helplessly
bella
went
to
the
kitchen
she
had
regained
her
old
look
of
dumbness
beside
the
figure
on
the
floor
pete
touched
one
of
the
girl
s
small
clenched
hands
it
was
like
ice
at
the
touch
she
moaned
and
hugh
ordered
sharply
let
her
so
the
boy
dragged
himself
up
again
and
stood
by
the
mantel
watching
hugh
with
puzzled
and
wondering
eyes
think
what
she
s
been
through
hugh
murmured
that
little
delicate
thing
wandering
for
two
days
out
in
this
cold
scared
by
the
woods
blinded
by
the
pain
starving
when
i
found
her
you
d
have
thought
she
d
be
afraid
of
a
wild
man
like
me
but
she
just
lifted
up
her
arms
like
a
baby
and
dropped
her
head
on
my
shoulder
she
she
patted
my
cheek
bella
brought
the
soup
and
hugh
raising
the
small
black
head
on
the
crook
of
his
arm
forced
a
spoonful
between
the
clenched
teeth
the
girl
swallowed
and
began
again
to
whimper
oh
my
eyes
my
eyes
they
hurt
me
so
she
turned
her
face
against
hugh
s
chest
and
clung
to
him
they
ll
be
better
soon
he
soothed
her
then
fiercely
to
bella
can
t
we
do
something
don
t
you
know
what
to
do
again
bella
went
to
the
kitchen
moving
like
an
automaton
hugh
coaxed
and
murmured
feeding
the
girl
in
spite
of
her
pain
he
managed
to
force
a
little
of
the
soup
down
her
throat
and
a
faint
stain
of
color
came
back
to
her
lips
and
cheeks
bella
presently
reappeared
with
salve
and
lotion
and
hugh
helped
her
hold
the
swollen
lids
apart
his
big
hands
very
skillful
while
she
gently
washed
out
the
eyes
then
they
put
the
salve
on
her
face
she
sighed
as
though
in
some
relief
and
again
snuggled
against
hugh
don
t
go
away
please
she
pleaded
in
a
sweet
trickle
of
voice
i
m
scared
to
feel
you
gone
you
re
so
warm
you
re
so
strong
will
you
talk
to
me
again
please
your
voice
is
so
comforting
so
so
hugh
talked
the
others
drew
away
and
watched
and
listened
they
did
not
look
at
each
other
for
some
reason
pete
was
ashamed
to
meet
bella
s
eyes
as
usual
they
were
the
audience
those
two
they
sat
each
in
a
chair
the
width
of
the
room
apart
below
them
his
grizzled
head
and
warped
face
transfigured
by
its
new
tenderness
hugh
bent
over
the
child
in
his
arms
pete
held
his
tumult
of
curiosity
of
interest
in
leash
he
could
hear
his
heart
pounding
you
re
safe
now
and
warm
hugh
was
murmuring
no
need
to
be
scared
no
need
i
ll
take
care
of
you
go
to
sleep
i
m
strong
enough
to
keep
off
anything
you
re
safe
and
snug
as
a
little
bird
in
its
nest
that
s
right
go
to
pete
s
blue
eyes
dwelt
on
this
amazing
spectacle
with
curious
wonder
this
was
a
hugh
he
had
never
seen
before
for
the
first
time
in
fifteen
years
he
realized
the
man
had
forgotten
himself
chapter
iv
to
hugh
garth
the
girl
told
her
story
at
last
she
seemed
to
realize
only
dimly
that
there
were
two
other
living
beings
in
this
house
to
her
a
house
of
darkness
peopled
only
by
voices
pete
s
modest
rare
boy
speeches
bella
s
brief
smothered
statements
the
great
music
of
hugh
s
utterance
must
indeed
have
filled
her
narrowed
world
so
it
was
to
him
she
turned
he
was
always
near
her
sitting
on
the
pelt
beside
the
chair
to
which
after
a
day
and
night
in
bella
s
bed
she
was
helped
she
had
a
charming
fashion
of
speech
rather
slow
motions
of
her
lips
which
had
some
difficulty
with
r
and
s
a
difficulty
which
she
evidently
struggled
against
conscientiously
and
as
she
talked
she
gesticulated
with
her
slim
little
hands
she
was
a
touching
thing
sitting
there
in
hugh
s
carved
throne
he
an
abdicated
monarch
at
her
feet
knee
in
hand
grizzled
head
tilted
back
hazel
eyes
raised
to
her
and
filled
with
adoration
i
am
called
sylvie
doone
she
said
with
that
quaint
struggle
over
the
i
was
always
miserable
at
she
gave
the
quick
sigh
of
a
child
you
see
my
father
died
when
i
was
very
little
and
then
my
mother
married
again
we
lived
in
the
grimmest
little
town
hardly
more
than
a
dozen
houses
beside
a
stream
up
in
massachusetts
farming
country
but
poor
farming
hard
farming
the
kind
that
twists
the
men
with
rheumatism
and
makes
the
women
all
pinched
and
worn
mother
was
like
that
she
died
when
i
was
thirteen
you
see
there
i
was
so
queerly
fixed
i
had
to
live
with
pynche
there
was
no
other
home
for
me
anywhere
and
he
kind
of
resented
it
he
had
enough
money
not
to
need
me
for
work
a
sister
of
his
did
the
housework
better
than
i
could
and
yet
he
was
poor
enough
to
hate
having
to
feed
me
and
pay
for
my
clothes
i
was
always
feeling
in
the
way
and
a
burden
there
was
nothing
i
could
do
then
i
saw
something
about
the
movies
in
a
magazine
and
pictures
of
girls
not
much
than
me
making
lots
of
money
i
borrowed
some
money
from
a
clerk
who
wanted
to
keep
company
with
me
i
ve
paid
it
back
and
i
went
to
new
york
i
did
get
a
job
but
i
m
not
a
good
she
faltered
over
the
rest
a
commonplace
story
of
engagements
of
failures
until
she
found
herself
touring
the
west
with
a
wretched
theatrical
troupe
we
were
booked
for
a
little
town
off
there
beyond
your
woods
and
the
train
was
stalled
in
a
snowstorm
we
got
on
a
but
it
got
stuck
in
a
drift
on
one
of
those
dreadful
roads
i
was
freezing
cold
and
i
thought
i
d
make
a
short
cut
through
the
woods
the
road
was
running
along
the
edge
of
a
big
forest
of
pines
i
cut
off
while
they
were
all
working
to
dig
out
the
horses
mr
snaring
said
look
out
for
the
bears
and
i
laughed
and
ran
up
what
looked
like
a
trail
there
was
a
hard
crust
the
woods
were
all
glittering
and
so
beautiful
i
ran
into
them
laughing
i
was
so
glad
to
get
away
by
myself
from
those
people
into
the
woods
where
it
was
so
silent
and
sort
of
solemn
like
being
in
a
church
again
i
can
t
think
how
i
got
so
lost
i
meant
to
come
round
back
to
the
road
but
before
i
knew
it
i
didn
t
know
which
way
the
road
was
the
pines
were
so
dense
so
all
alike
they
looked
almost
as
if
they
kept
sort
of
shifting
about
me
i
tried
to
follow
back
on
my
footprints
but
in
some
places
snow
had
shaken
down
from
the
branches
and
there
were
so
many
so
dreadfully
many
other
tracks
of
animals
she
put
her
hands
over
her
face
and
shrank
down
in
her
chair
forget
about
them
sylvie
hugh
admonished
gently
even
if
there
had
been
bears
about
they
wouldn
t
likely
have
bothered
you
i
can
t
bring
myself
to
tell
you
about
that
time
i
can
t
don
t
then
only
how
did
you
live
through
the
night
my
dear
i
don
t
know
except
that
i
never
stayed
still
i
got
out
from
the
trees
because
i
was
afraid
of
bears
and
i
lost
my
hat
the
sun
was
like
fire
shining
up
from
underneath
and
down
from
up
above
my
eyes
began
to
hurt
almost
at
once
and
by
the
time
night
came
it
was
agony
the
darkness
didn
t
seem
to
help
me
any
either
the
glare
still
seemed
to
come
in
under
my
lids
i
couldn
t
sleep
for
the
pain
i
knew
i
d
freeze
if
i
stood
still
so
i
kept
moving
all
night
trampling
round
in
circles
i
suppose
next
morning
the
terrible
glare
began
again
then
everything
went
red
i
was
nearly
crazy
when
you
found
me
please
call
me
hugh
he
murmured
taking
her
hand
in
his
i
feel
in
a
way
that
you
belong
to
me
now
i
saved
you
from
dying
alone
there
in
the
cold
and
brought
you
back
to
my
home
i
ve
got
jettison
rights
she
let
him
hold
her
hand
and
flushed
you
ll
never
know
what
it
felt
like
to
hear
your
voice
call
to
me
to
feel
you
pulling
me
up
i
d
only
just
dropped
a
few
minutes
before
but
i
d
never
have
struggled
up
it
would
have
been
the
she
trembled
in
the
memory
and
he
patted
her
hand
i
don
t
know
why
a
man
like
you
lives
off
here
in
this
wild
place
but
thank
god
you
do
live
here
though
she
added
with
wistfulness
twisting
her
soft
mouth
though
i
can
t
ever
quite
see
why
god
should
care
much
for
a
sylvie
she
touched
the
lids
of
her
closed
eyes
i
wonder
why
it
doesn
t
worry
me
more
not
to
be
able
to
see
now
that
the
pain
s
gone
i
don
t
seem
to
care
thank
god
perhaps
though
he
added
in
a
few
days
you
ll
see
she
smiled
i
d
just
love
to
see
you
must
be
wonderful
what
makes
you
think
that
he
asked
his
warped
face
glowing
you
re
so
strong
and
young
such
thick
hair
such
finely
shaped
hands
and
such
a
sylvie
s
associates
had
been
of
a
profession
that
deals
perpetually
in
personalities
if
i
d
been
blind
a
long
time
i
suppose
i
could
just
run
my
hand
over
your
face
and
i
d
know
what
you
look
like
but
i
can
t
tell
a
she
felt
for
his
face
and
brushed
it
eagerly
with
her
fingers
laughing
at
herself
i
just
know
that
you
have
thick
eyelashes
and
are
is
bella
your
wife
and
that
big
little
boy
your
son
he
started
no
she
s
a
faithful
thing
the
boy
s
nurse
and
the
kid
s
my
young
brother
a
great
gawk
of
a
boy
for
his
age
a
regular
it
s
so
hard
to
tell
anything
about
people
if
you
can
t
see
them
i
wouldn
t
have
thought
he
was
so
big
is
he
about
fourteen
or
fifteen
he
speaks
so
low
and
gently
he
might
be
any
and
a
man
s
height
pretty
near
too
big
to
lick
though
he
needs
and
bella
what
s
she
like
a
mummy
of
a
the
kitchen
door
creaked
hugh
started
and
shot
a
look
over
his
shoulder
bella
stood
on
the
kitchen
threshold
with
an
expressionless
face
and
lowered
eyelids
why
did
you
jump
asked
sylvie
nervously
hugh
wet
his
lips
with
his
tongue
nothing
the
door
creaked
go
on
tell
me
more
child
he
urged
no
i
want
to
hear
about
you
now
tell
me
your
hugh
clenched
his
hands
and
flushed
darkly
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
with
a
furtive
look
but
bella
had
gone
no
one
else
rightly
knows
my
story
sylvie
will
you
promise
me
never
to
speak
of
it
to
bella
to
pete
to
any
one
of
course
i
her
face
beamed
with
the
pride
of
a
child
entrusted
with
a
secret
then
lowering
his
voice
and
moving
closer
to
her
chair
he
began
a
fictitious
history
a
history
of
persecuted
and
heroic
innocence
of
reckless
adventure
of
daring
the
girl
listened
with
parted
lips
her
cheeks
glowed
and
behind
the
door
bella
too
listened
straining
her
ears
the
murmur
of
hugh
s
recital
rising
now
and
then
to
some
melodramatic
climax
then
dropping
cautiously
rippled
on
broken
now
and
again
by
sylvie
s
ejaculations
behind
the
door
bella
stood
like
a
wooden
block
colorless
and
stolid
as
though
she
understood
not
a
syllable
of
what
she
heard
but
after
a
rigid
hour
she
faltered
away
stumbled
across
the
kitchen
and
out
into
the
snow
there
in
the
broad
light
of
the
setting
sun
pete
rhythmically
bent
and
straightened
over
his
saw
the
tool
sang
with
a
hissing
ringing
rhythm
and
the
young
man
drove
it
with
a
lithe
long
swing
of
body
forward
and
back
forward
and
back
in
alternate
postures
of
untiring
grace
the
air
was
not
cold
there
was
the
cloudy
softness
premonitory
of
a
spring
storm
the
sun
glowed
like
a
dying
fire
through
a
long
narrow
rift
in
the
shrouded
west
pete
had
thrown
aside
his
coat
and
drawn
in
his
belt
the
collar
of
his
flannel
shirt
was
open
and
turned
back
his
head
was
bare
the
bright
gold
of
his
short
hair
the
scarlet
of
his
cheeks
the
vivid
blue
of
his
brooding
eyes
made
shocks
of
color
against
the
prevailing
whiteness
even
the
indigo
of
his
overalls
and
the
dark
gray
of
his
shirt
stood
out
with
a
curious
value
of
tint
and
texture
his
bare
hands
and
forearms
glowed
he
was
whistling
with
a
boy
s
vigor
and
a
bird
s
sweetness
bella
caught
pete
s
arm
as
it
bent
for
one
of
the
strong
forward
sweeps
he
stopped
let
go
of
his
saw
and
turned
to
her
smiling
then
the
smile
gone
what
s
wrong
her
eyes
flamed
in
her
pale
tense
face
we
ve
got
to
stop
it
pete
she
said
it
s
horrible
what
don
t
stand
out
here
with
those
bare
arms
he
was
pulling
his
own
down
over
his
glistening
bronze
forearms
as
he
spoke
we
can
t
talk
in
the
house
she
said
and
i
ve
got
to
talk
i
do
you
know
what
hugh
s
doing
what
he
s
telling
that
girl
what
he
s
letting
her
believe
pete
shook
his
head
but
at
the
same
time
turned
his
blue
eyes
away
from
her
toward
the
glowing
west
lies
said
bella
she
laughed
a
short
explosive
laugh
he
s
got
his
ideal
audience
at
last
a
blind
one
she
thinks
he
s
young
and
handsome
and
heroic
pete
she
thinks
he
s
a
hero
she
thinks
he
s
buried
himself
out
here
for
the
sake
of
somebody
else
oh
it
s
a
regular
romance
and
it
s
been
going
on
for
hours
it
s
still
going
on
by
now
he
believes
it
all
himself
he
s
putting
in
the
details
and
sylvie
oh
she
s
saying
and
ah
garth
how
you
must
have
suffered
how
wonderful
you
are
and
look
at
me
pete
do
you
want
to
know
what
we
are
according
to
him
you
and
i
he
did
not
turn
his
eyes
from
the
west
even
when
she
shook
his
arm
i
m
a
mummy
of
a
woman
faithful
yes
i
m
faithful
an
old
servant
and
you
re
a
child
an
overgrown
of
a
boy
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
the
young
man
stood
tall
and
still
a
statue
of
golden
youth
in
the
golden
light
the
woman
clutching
at
his
arm
her
face
twisted
her
eyes
afire
all
the
colorlessness
of
her
body
and
the
suppressed
flame
of
her
spirit
pitilessly
apparent
look
at
me
well
he
sighed
gently
what
of
it
he
looked
down
at
her
and
smiled
it
s
the
first
good
time
he
s
had
for
fifteen
years
you
know
we
don
t
make
him
happy
i
don
t
grudge
him
his
joy
bella
do
you
it
can
t
last
long
anyway
fairy
tales
can
t
hurt
her
hugh
believes
almost
in
his
own
inventions
she
ll
be
going
back
her
friends
will
be
hunting
for
her
i
ll
let
her
think
i
m
a
of
a
boy
if
it
makes
him
any
happier
to
have
me
one
and
why
do
you
care
she
drew
in
her
breath
oh
i
don
t
suppose
i
care
so
much
she
said
haltingly
but
think
of
the
his
eyes
widened
a
little
and
fell
the
girl
she
s
falling
in
love
with
him
pete
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
aloud
oh
bella
you
know
funny
it
s
not
it
s
tragic
it
s
horrible
you
ll
see
watch
her
i
have
watched
he
spoke
dreamily
it
s
a
very
pretty
and
sweet
pete
hugh
s
robbing
me
yes
you
re
young
you
re
ready
for
loving
this
child
god
sent
her
to
you
to
get
you
out
of
this
desolation
to
lead
you
back
to
loving
and
living
to
give
you
what
you
ought
to
have
it
was
as
though
she
had
struck
him
he
started
and
drew
himself
away
shut
up
bella
he
said
with
boyish
roughness
and
limped
past
her
into
the
house
chapter
v
in
these
days
hugh
must
have
known
that
his
as
he
led
the
little
blind
girl
through
the
forest
of
his
romancing
was
at
the
mercy
of
those
two
that
knew
him
for
what
he
really
was
except
for
queer
wild
threatening
looks
now
and
again
he
gave
no
sign
he
played
his
part
magnificently
even
trusting
them
to
come
in
with
help
when
they
were
given
their
cue
he
had
dominated
them
for
so
long
that
even
they
and
the
picture
of
him
that
they
held
in
their
minds
were
not
so
real
as
his
dreams
it
was
a
queer
game
queer
and
breathless
played
in
this
narrow
space
shut
in
by
the
white
wilderness
and
as
the
slow
days
went
by
the
low
log
house
seemed
to
be
filled
more
and
more
with
smothered
and
conflicting
emotions
a
dozen
times
the
whole
extravaganza
came
near
collapse
a
dozen
times
hugh
saved
it
by
a
word
or
pete
and
bella
by
a
silence
their
parts
were
not
easy
and
although
pete
still
smiled
his
young
clear
face
grew
whiter
and
more
strained
sylvie
treated
him
always
as
though
he
were
a
child
she
would
pat
his
head
and
rumple
his
hair
if
he
sat
near
her
once
suddenly
she
kissed
him
lightly
on
the
cheek
after
he
had
moved
the
chair
for
her
you
re
a
dear
quiet
boy
she
said
i
frightened
you
to
death
then
didn
t
i
hasn
t
anyone
ever
kissed
you
before
his
cheek
burned
so
that
touching
it
with
her
fingers
she
laughed
i
ve
made
you
blush
poor
kid
i
know
boys
hate
petting
don
t
they
you
ll
have
to
get
used
to
it
pete
because
i
mean
to
pet
you
oh
a
lot
you
need
some
one
to
draw
you
out
these
two
people
snub
you
too
much
boys
of
fourteen
aren
t
quite
children
after
all
are
they
besides
they
re
interesting
i
know
i
was
fourteen
myself
not
such
ages
back
you
re
not
cross
are
you
pete
his
eyes
were
misty
and
his
hands
were
cold
he
could
not
understand
his
own
emotion
his
own
pain
he
muttered
something
and
got
himself
away
she
called
him
sullen
and
was
angry
with
him
complaining
to
hugh
at
supper
that
petey
had
been
a
bear
to
her
hugh
simulated
a
playful
annoyance
and
began
to
scold
then
a
sort
of
nervous
fury
came
over
him
he
stamped
and
struck
the
table
and
snarled
at
pete
the
young
man
rose
at
his
place
and
stared
at
his
brother
silently
there
were
two
splotches
of
deep
color
on
his
cheeks
sylvie
protested
don
t
please
be
so
angry
with
him
i
was
only
teasing
just
in
fun
bella
tell
hugh
to
stop
i
had
no
business
to
kiss
pete
but
i
just
wanted
to
pet
hugh
s
threatening
suddenly
stopped
and
pete
sat
down
in
the
strained
silence
bella
laughed
her
laughter
had
the
sound
of
a
snapped
sylvie
had
pushed
her
chair
back
a
little
from
the
table
and
was
turning
her
head
quickly
from
one
to
the
other
of
them
her
mouth
showed
a
tremble
of
uncertainty
it
was
easy
to
see
that
she
sensed
a
tension
a
confusion
hugh
leaned
forward
and
broke
into
a
rattle
of
speech
and
as
pete
and
bella
sat
silent
sylvie
gradually
was
reassured
near
the
end
of
the
meal
she
put
out
her
hand
toward
pete
please
don
t
be
so
cross
with
me
pete
give
me
a
shake
for
he
touched
her
hand
his
eyes
lowered
and
drew
his
fingers
away
she
laughed
how
shy
you
are
a
wild
forest
thing
i
ll
have
to
civilize
leave
him
alone
admonished
hugh
softly
leave
him
as
he
said
this
he
did
not
look
at
sylvie
but
gazed
somberly
at
pete
it
was
a
strange
look
at
once
appealing
and
threatening
pitiful
and
dangerous
pete
fingered
his
fork
nervously
finally
bella
stood
up
and
began
to
clear
the
table
with
an
unaccustomed
clatter
of
noisy
energy
how
long
are
you
going
to
keep
it
up
pete
she
asked
him
afterward
he
was
helping
her
wash
the
dishes
drying
them
deftly
with
a
piece
of
since
we
ve
let
it
begin
we
ll
have
to
go
on
with
it
to
a
finish
he
answered
coldly
after
all
he
paused
polished
a
platter
and
turned
away
to
put
it
on
its
shelf
he
s
not
doing
anything
so
dreadful
just
twisting
the
facts
a
little
i
an
ignorant
lout
i
might
as
well
be
fourteen
for
all
i
and
i
a
mummy
of
a
woman
in
pity
for
her
he
made
to
put
his
arm
about
her
don
t
be
a
goose
bella
he
said
but
she
flung
his
hand
from
her
why
does
it
make
you
so
sore
and
angry
he
asked
wistfully
hugh
is
not
pretty
to
look
at
but
perhaps
sylvie
sees
him
better
than
we
do
in
a
way
and
if
she
learns
to
love
him
while
she
s
blind
then
when
she
sees
him
if
she
ever
sees
him
chances
are
she
never
will
if
her
eyes
don
t
get
better
soon
they
likely
never
isn
t
it
horrible
you
don
t
seem
to
think
so
so
long
s
she
has
hugh
to
paint
pictures
for
her
what
does
she
need
eyes
for
what
s
to
come
of
it
pete
she
s
falling
in
love
with
the
fine
figure
of
a
hero
he
s
made
her
believe
he
is
but
how
can
he
marry
her
couldn
t
he
go
off
somewhere
else
and
marry
her
and
start
again
honest
i
think
if
hugh
had
some
one
who
thought
he
was
a
god
he
d
likely
enough
be
one
he
he
lives
by
illusion
isn

that
the
word
it
s
kind
of
easy
to
be
noble
when
some
one
you
love
believes
you
to
be
isn
t
it
that
s
hugh
he
bella
threw
down
her
rag
turned
fiercely
upon
him
and
gripped
his
shoulders
are
you
a
man
or
a
child
she
said
you
love
this
girl
yourself
no
he
cried
and
broke
from
her
and
went
limping
out
into
the
frosty
night
with
its
comfortless
glitter
of
stars
as
soon
as
his
ankle
was
stronger
pete
spent
all
day
and
most
of
the
night
on
his
skis
trying
to
outrun
the
growing
shadow
of
his
misery
hugh
s
work
fell
on
his
shoulders
he
had
not
only
his
accustomed
chores
the
caliban
duties
of
woodchopping
and
the
dressing
of
wild
meat
the
and
heavier
housework
the
repairs
about
the
cabin
but
he
had
the
trapping
in
hugh
s
profound
new
absorption
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
necessity
for
making
a
livelihood
during
the
first
years
of
their
exile
they
had
lived
on
his
savings
ordering
their
supplies
by
the
mail
which
left
them
at
the
foot
of
that
distant
trail
leading
into
the
forest
thence
hugh
under
shelter
of
night
would
carry
them
lonely
terrible
journeys
that
taxed
even
his
strength
when
pete
grew
big
enough
to
load
he
was
sent
to
the
and
hugh
became
an
expert
trapper
the
savings
were
not
entirely
spent
but
they
were
no
longer
touched
the
pelts
brought
a
livelihood
pete
had
had
his
instructions
concerning
his
behavior
at
the
many
years
before
he
had
stammered
a
legend
of
a
sickly
father
who
had
died
who
was
buried
back
there
by
the
lonely
cabin
where
he
and
his
mother
chose
to
live
bella
and
hugh
had
even
dug
up
a
mound
for
which
they
had
fashioned
a
rude
cross
it
could
be
seen
in
summer
from
the
window
that
mock
grave
more
terrible
in
its
suggestions
than
a
real
grave
ever
could
have
been
there
was
also
a
under
the
boards
of
the
floor
no
one
had
ever
seen
the
grave
or
driven
hugh
into
hiding
it
was
not
an
inquisitive
country
and
its
desolation
was
forbidding
pete
had
learned
to
discourage
the
rare
sociability
of
the
other
traders
now
however
the
young
man
had
not
only
to
trade
his
pelts
but
to
trap
them
and
for
this
business
of
trapping
which
was
distasteful
to
him
he
had
not
a
tithe
of
hugh
s
skill
his
bundle
of
pelts
brought
him
a
sorry
supply
of
necessities
he
was
ashamed
himself
and
having
dumped
the
burden
from
his
shoulders
to
the
kitchen
floor
would
hurry
into
the
other
room
not
to
see
bella
s
expression
when
she
opened
her
bundles
pete
was
tired
the
load
had
not
been
heavy
but
the
snow
was
beginning
to
soften
under
the
mild
glowing
of
an
april
sun
and
his
skis
had
tugged
at
his
feet
and
gathered
a
clogging
mass
his
body
ached
and
there
was
a
sullen
and
despairing
weight
upon
his
spirit
a
mob
of
rebels
danced
in
his
heart
he
watched
hugh
s
face
saw
the
flaring
adoration
of
his
eyes
thought
that
sylvie
must
feel
the
scorch
of
them
on
her
cheek
so
close
in
his
own
eyes
there
showed
a
brooding
fire
bella
broke
into
the
room
look
here
she
said
you
d
better
get
to
trapping
again
hugh
garth
pete
s
pelts
don
t
bring
a
quarter
of
what
we
need
especially
these
sylvie
quivered
as
though
a
wound
had
been
touched
oh
you
mean
me
she
said
i
know
you
mean
me
i
m
making
trouble
i
m
eating
too
much
i
ll
go
pete
has
anybody
been
asking
about
me
at
the
trying
to
find
me
they
be
hunting
for
she
had
stood
up
and
was
clasping
and
unclasping
her
hands
hugh
and
pete
protested
in
one
breath
nonsense
sylvie
and
pete
went
on
with
there
hasn
t
been
anyone
asking
about
you
but
so
much
the
better
for
us
you
re
safe
here
and
comfortable
aren
t
you
and
hugh
tell
her
what
it
means
to
us
to
have
her
it
was
more
of
a
speech
than
he
had
made
since
sylvie
s
arrival
and
it
was
not
just
the
speech
in
tone
or
manner
of
a
boy
there
was
a
new
somber
note
in
his
voice
too
some
of
the
youthful
quality
had
gone
out
of
it
sylvie
took
a
step
toward
him
to
thank
him
perhaps
perhaps
to
satisfy
by
laying
her
hand
upon
him
a
sudden
bewilderment
but
in
her
blindness
she
stumbled
on
the
edge
of
the
hearth
and
to
save
her
from
falling
pete
caught
her
in
his
arms
for
an
instant
he
held
her
close
held
her
fiercely
closer
and
more
fiercely
than
he
knew
and
sylvie
felt
the
strength
of
him
and
heard
the
pounding
of
his
heart
then
hugh
plucked
her
away
with
a
smothered
oath
he
put
her
into
a
chair
crushed
her
hand
in
one
of
his
and
turned
upon
bella
go
back
into
the
kitchen
he
ordered
brutally
trapping
s
not
your
business
you
mind
your
be
careful
hugh
bella
s
whisper
whistled
like
a
falling
lash
i
ll
not

that
tone
from
you
be
careful
oh
pleaded
sylvie
why
do
you
all

work

much
harder

learning
to
feel
my
way
about

able
to
help
you
i
should
think
you

be
glad
to
have
a
girl
in
the
house
another
woman
i
m
sorry
to
be
a
nuisance
really
i
am
i
d
go
if
i
the
lonely
deep
silence
always
waiting
to
fall
upon
them
shut
down
with
suddenness
at
the
end
of
her
sweet
tearful
quaver
of
appeal
for
minutes
no
one
spoke
then
pete
followed
bella
out
of
the
room
she
had
not
answered
sylvie
s
beseeching
questions
but
had
only
stood
with
lowered
head
her
face
working
her
hands
twisting
her
dress
she
had
run
out
just
as
her
face
cramped
as
though
for
tears
when
the
other
two
had
gone
hugh
captured
both
of
sylvie
s
hands
in
his
you
don
t
mean
that
do
you
he
asked
brokenly
you
don
t
mean
you
d
go
away
if
you
could
sylvie
at
hugh
s
voice
she
started
and
the
color
rushed
into
her
cheeks
if
i
make
you
quarrel
if
i
m
a
nuisance
if
pete
and
bella
hate
me
so
but
i
he
said
i
love
he
drew
her
head
she
was
sitting
in
her
chair
again
against
his
side
no
don
t
smile
at
me
like
that
i
don
t
mean
the
sort
of
love
you
think
i
love
you
terribly
can
t
you
feel
how
i
love
you
listen
close
against
my
heart
don
t
be
frightened
there
now
you
know
how
i
love
you
he
rained
kisses
on
her
head
resting
droopingly
against
him
how
can
a
man
like
you
love
she
asked
with
wistful
uncertainty
a
man
like
me
hugh
groaned
ah
but
i
do
i
do
you
must
stay
with
me
always
sylvie
somehow
we
will
be
married
you
and
i
now
it
frightens
me
she
whispered
being
blind
it
does
frighten
me
now
i
want
so
terribly
to
see
your
face
your
eyes
oh
you
mustn
t
marry
a
blind
girl
a
waif
you
ve
been
so
noble
you
ve
suffered
so
terribly
you
ought
to
have
some
wonderful
woman
who
would
understand
your
greatness
would
see
all
that
you
now
he
sighed
now
i
great
because
you
think
i
am
that
s
water
to
me
after
a
lifetime
of
hugh
i
good
enough
for
you
she
was
sobbing
and
laughing
at
the
same
time
it
was
too
much
for
him
he
drew
himself
gently
away
he
whispered
i
can
t
bear
being
loved
being
happy
i
ll
go
out
by
myself
for
a
bit
alone
sylvie
sylvie
every
instant
i
i
worship
he
threw
himself
down
before
her
and
pressed
his
face
against
her
knees
she
caressed
the
thick
grizzled
hair
he
stood
up
and
then
stumbled
away
from
her
more
blind
than
she
out
of
the
house
into
the
gathering
night
chapter
vi
in
the
big
rudely
carved
chair
sylvie
leaned
back
her
head
and
pressed
her
hands
to
her
unseeing
eyes
she
was
not
sorry
that
hugh
had
left
her
for
she
was
oppressed
and
unnerved
by
her
own
emotions
until
he
had
kissed
her
hair
she
had
not
known
that
she
loved
him
or
rather
loved
an
invisible
presence
that
had
enveloped
her
in
an
atmosphere
of
sympathy
of
protection
that
had
painted
itself
so
to
speak
in
heroic
colors
and
proportions
against
her
darkness
that
had
revealed
both
strength
and
tenderness
in
touch
and
movement
and
warm
deep
voice
for
until
now
sylvie
s
life
had
been
entirely
lacking
in
protection
and
tenderness
she
had
never
known
sympathy
her
natural
romanticism
had
been
starved
the
lacks
in
her
life
hugh
had
supplied
the
more
lavishly
because
he
was
aided
in
her
blindness
by
the
unrestricted
powers
of
her
fancy
but
now
in
all
the
fervor
of
this
sylvie
felt
also
for
the
first
time
the
full
bitterness
of
her
blindness
if
she
could
see
him
if
only
once
if
she
could
see
him
and
there
came
to
sylvie
unreasonably
disconnectedly
a
keen
memory
of
pete
s
embrace
when
he
had
caught
her
up
from
falling
on
the
hearth
a
boy
of
fourteen
strange
that
he
should
be
so
strong
that
his
heart
should
beat
so
loud
that
his
arms
should
draw
themselves
so
closely
so
powerfully
about
her
what
were
they
really
like
these
people
who
moved
unseen
around
her
and
who
exerted
such
great
power
over
her
sudden
helplessness
she
got
up
and
began
to
walk
to
and
fro
restlessly
gropingly
across
the
room
she
wished
now
that
hugh
would
come
back
he
had
been
with
her
so
constantly
that
she
had
grown
utterly
dependent
upon
him
the
dense
red
fog
that
lay
so
thick
about
her
frightened
her
when
hugh
was
not
there
to
keep
her
mind
busy
with
his
talk
to
paint
pictures
for
her
to
command
her
with
his
magnetic
presence
she
stood
still
and
strained
her
eyes
she
see
again
if
she
tried
hard
the
red
fog
would
surely
lift
happiness
and
her
new
love
they
would
be
strong
enough
to
dispel
the
mist
there
already
it
was
a
shade
lighter
she
almost
thought
that
she
could
make
out
the
brightness
of
the
fire
she
went
toward
it
and
sat
down
on
the
holding
out
her
tremulous
excited
hands
and
with
a
sudden
impulse
toward
confidence
she
called
pete
o
pete
come
here
a
moment
he
came
and
she
beckoned
to
him
with
a
gesture
and
an
upward
vaguely
directed
smile
to
sit
beside
her
she
was
aware
of
the
rigid
reserve
of
his
body
holding
itself
at
a
distance
pete
she
said
wistfully
what
can
i
do
to
make
you
love
me
he
uttered
a
queer
sharp
sound
but
said
nothing
are
you
jealous
no
sylvie
he
muttered
oh
how
i
wish
i
could
see
you
pete
i
know
then
i
d
understand
you
better
pete
try
to
be
a
little
more
more
human
tell
me
about
yourself
haven
t
you
a
bit
of
fondness
for
me
you
see
i
want
pete
some
day
perhaps
i
ll
be
your
sister
then
he
has
asked
you
to
marry
him
he
was
usually
so
quiet
that
she
was
startled
at
this
new
tone
don
t
she
said
hush
we
have
only
just
found
out
he
went
away
because
he
couldn
t
bear
his
own
happiness
pete
she
felt
for
him
and
her
hand
touched
his
cheek
oh
pete
your
face
is
wet
you
re
no
i
m
not
he
denied
evenly
it
was
melting
from
the
roof
when
i
came
she
sighed
you
are
so
strange
pete
will
you
let
me
kiss
you
now
since
you
are
going
to
be
my
big
little
brother
i
can
t
he
whispered
i
can
she
laughed
and
crooked
her
arm
about
his
neck
forcing
his
face
down
to
hers
his
lips
were
hard
and
cool
the
face
that
sylvie
imagined
a
boy
s
face
shy
and
blushing
half
frightened
half
cross
perhaps
a
trifle
pleased
was
so
white
and
patient
a
face
in
its
misery
that
her
blind
tenderness
seemed
almost
like
an
intentional
cruelty
it
was
an
intensity
of
feeling
almost
palpable
but
sylvie
s
mouth
remained
unburnt
though
it
removed
itself
with
a
pathetic
little
twist
of
disappointment
you
don
t
need
to
say
anything
she
said
you
ve
shown
me
how
you
feel
you
can
t
like
me
you
are
sorry
i
came
and
i
want
so
dreadfully
for
some
one
just
now
to
talk
to
to
help
me
to
understand
it
s
all
dark
and
wonderful
and
frightening
i
wish
i
had
a
brother
she
bent
her
face
to
her
knees
and
began
to
cry
simply
and
passionately
at
that
pete
found
it
easy
to
forget
himself
he
put
his
arm
very
carefully
about
her
laying
one
of
his
hands
on
her
bent
head
and
stroking
her
hair
you
have
a
brother
he
said
right
the
dark
small
silken
head
shook
no
you
don
t
like
i
do
i
do
please
tell
me
everything
you
feel
like
telling
i

t
had
a
chance
to
know
you
as
he
does
and
i
guess
well
maybe
i
m
sort
of
she
lifted
her
head
at
that
took
his
stroking
hand
and
held
it
in
both
of
hers
under
her
chin
as
a
little
girl
holds
her
pet
kitten
for
the
pleasure
of
its
warmth
you
must
get
over
being
shy
with
me
pete
we
both
love
hugh
we
both
admire
him
so
i
d
so
love
to
talk
to
you
about
him
then

i
ve
never
seen
him
she
sighed
and
you
can
see
him
all
day
long
pete
will
you
try
your
best
now
to
describe
hugh
to
me
every
bit
of
him

me
the
color
of
his
eyes
and
the
shape
of
his
face
and

about
him
i
i

at
that
sylvie

color
of
his
he

hazel
eyes

she
drank
in
his
words
eagerly
pressing
his
hand
tighter
in
her
excitement
go
on
if
only
you
were
a
girl
now

do
this
so

of
course
i
know
that

t
he
pick
me
up
out
of
the
snow
and
carry
me
home
he
moved
as
though

had
a
feather
on
his
arm
you

very
strong
too
pete
strong

viking

of
man

dreamed
about
when
i
was
a
little
girl
you
think
i

hand
away
dear
you
can
t
guess
how
it
comforts
me
i
m
awfully
alone
here
and
strange
i
don
t
suppose
you
know
how
queer
and
frightening
it
s
been
this
getting
lost
and
being
brought
here
in
the
dark
and
then
living
on
in
the
dark
just
trusting
my
instincts
my
intuitions
instead
of
my
eyes
voices
tell
a
lot
about
people
don
t
they
more
than
i
ever
dreamed
they
could
pete
there
is
nothing
in
that
that
splendid
generous
thing
hugh
did
the
thing
i
am
not
to
talk
about
nothing
to
keep
hugh
now
from
going
back
to
the
world
some
place
that
is
far
away
from
where
it
happened
and
beginning
again
is
there
i
hope
not
she
sighed
of
course
it
was
wonderful
if
he
hadn
t
told
me
of
it
i
never
should
have
known
half
of
his
greatness
yet
i
can
t
help
wishing
he
were
free
it
s
sad
to
think
there
will
always
be
the
memory
of
that
dreadful
suffering
and
danger
in
his
very
sad
said
pete
how
alone
we
both
are
he
and
i
bella
and
you
pete
don
t
be
angry
please
i
don
t
think
you
quite
understand
hugh
quite
appreciate
perhaps
he
has
always
been
lonely
you
are
so
young
and
bella
is
so
stupid
stupid
and
no
she
isn
t
sylvie
i
know
bella
a
lot
better
than
you
do
she
s
not
stupid
or
cross
well
i
like
you
to
stick
up
for
your
old
nurse
she
certainly
must
have
loved
you
a
lot
to
bring
you
way
out
here
and
to
stay
here
all
these
years
to
take
care
of
you
i
wonder
where
she
ll
go
and
what
she
ll
do
when
hugh
and
i
get
married
you
re
too
old
for
a
nurse
now
pete
do
you
mind
if
i
lean
back
against
you
that
way
it
s
so
comfortable
i
d
be
happier
without
bella
pete
you
would
you
sylvie
well
bella
and
i
will
have
to
go
away
together
somewhere
i
i
didn
t
say
you
dear
i
love
you
a
lot
next
best
to
hugh
there
s
something
awfully
sweet
about
you
you
great
strong
overgrown
thing
your
heart
goes
as
though
it
was
as
big
as
the
sun
i
feel
much
better
and
happier
now
things
have
got
steady
again
only
i
wish
hugh
would
come
pete
gave
a
strangled
sigh
he
ll
be
and
he
began
to
draw
himself
away
from
her
i
think
i
hear
him
now
stay
where
you
are
she
laughed
don
t
be
ashamed
of
being
found
with
a
sister
leaning
against
you
and
holding
your
hand
are
you
afraid
of
hugh
i
think
sometimes
he
s
rather
hard
with
you
i
ll
have
to
speak
to
him
about
that
oh
in
a
sudden
ecstasy
how
happy
i
am
i
feel
as
light
as
the
air
i
want
every
one
to
be
happy
tell
me
when
hugh
comes
in
how
happy
he
looks
pete
promise
me
quick
there
he
is
at
the
door
yes
he
whispered
i
promise
let
me
go
please
he
pulled
himself
away
and
stood
up
at
the
instant
the
door
was
opened
and
shut
quickly
stealthily
it
was
hugh
breathing
hard
gray
with
fear
they
re
coming
he
said
harshly
pete
they
re
after
me
men
are
coming
across
the
chapter
vii
did
they
see
you
pete
demanded
anxiously
i
don
t
think
hugh
was
breathing
fast
he
had
evidently
fled
across
the
snow
at
top
speed
get
in
then
quick
out
of
pete
was
already
tearing
up
boards
above
that
place
of
hiding
hugh
was
about
to
step
down
into
it
when
he
glanced
up
and
saw
sylvie
she
was
standing
as
the
unseeing
stand
in
moments
of
frightened
bewilderment
her
hands
clasped
her
head
turning
from
side
to
side
look
here
whispered
hugh
still
absorbed
in
his
own
danger
don
t
let
them
know
that
sylvie
just
wandered
in
here
don
t
let
them
start
asking
her
any
questions
it
s
too
dangerous
let
her
be
one
of
the
he
smiled
maliciously
let
her
be
your
wife
then
as
though
that
picture
had
fired
his
love
through
its
hint
of
jeopardy
he
held
out
both
arms
suddenly
come
here
sylvie
lead
her
to
me
the
boy
obeyed
but
as
her
uncertain
arms
trembled
about
hugh
s
shoulders
pete
turned
sharply
away
he
heard
the
quick
anxious
murmur
of
their
voices
hugh
dearest
are
you
afraid
and
his
trust
me
little
darling
love
a
kiss
then
a
sharp
whispered
summons
quick
can
t
you
pete
get
these
boards
when
pete
turned
hugh
had
dropped
into
the
darkness
and
sylvie
stood
flushed
and
with
her
hands
over
her
face
bella
had
meantime
been
collecting
the
most
characteristic
of
hugh
s
belongings
those
that
could
not
be
supposed
to
belong
to
pete
and
now
thrust
them
down
into
the
the
boards
were
rearranged
the
rug
laid
evenly
over
them
then
the
three
stood
staring
at
one
another
listening
helplessly
to
the
nearing
sounds
oh
pete
sylvie
gasped
tell
me
what
i
must
do
or
what
i
ought
to
tell
them
said
bella
what
hugh
told
you
that
you
are
pete
s
wife
they
ll
be
looking
for
a
different
household
from
that
and
it
will
help
to
put
them
but
but
pete
won
t
look
old
yes
he
will
he
looks
older
than
you
bella
declared
harshly
you
sit
down
and
keep
quiet
that
s
the
best
you
can
do
and
for
god
s
sake
don
t
look
so
scared
there
s
a
grave
outside
to
show
them
and
nobody
digs
up
a
grave
they
won
t
find
hugh
nobody
s
ever
seen
him
don
t
shake
so
sylvie
they
may
not
even
be
after
him
this
country
has
sheltered
other
outlaws
you
know
hush
i
hear
them
i
ll
be
in
the
kitchen
pete
be
taking
off
your
outdoor
clothes
they
ll
have
seen
hugh
s
tracks
even
if
they
haven
t
seen
him
so
somebody
s
got
to
have
just
come
in
be
whistling
and
talking
natural
and
calm
remember
we
re
all
at
home
just
quiet
and
happy
no
reason
to
be
afraid
that
s
through
her
darkness
sylvie
heard
the
knocking
and
pete
s
opening
of
the
door
the
scraping
of
snow
the
questions
the
simplicity
of
pete
s
replies
then
she
was
made
known
my
wife
gentlemen
and
a
moment
later
my
mother
and
she
heard
bella
s
greeting
loud
and
cheerful
like
that
of
a
woman
who
is
glad
to
see
a
visitor
chairs
were
drawn
up
and
cigarettes
rolled
and
lighted
she
smelt
the
sharp
sweetness
of
the
smoke
there
was
brief
talk
of
the
weather
sylvie
felt
that
while
they
talked
the
two
strangers
searched
the
place
and
the
faces
of
its
inmates
with
cold
keen
suspicious
eyes
she
was
grateful
now
for
her
blindness
there
came
a
sharp
statement
we
re
looking
for
ham
rutherford
the
sylvie
s
heart
contracted
in
her
breast
well
sir
laughed
pete
in
his
most
boyish
fashion
that
sounds
interesting
but
it
s
a
new
name
to
it
s
an
old
case
however
said
the
man
the
man
who
spoke
more
like
an
easterner
than
the
sheriff
fifteen
years
old
they
ve
dug
it
up
again
back
east
the
daughter
of
the
man
that
was
killed
came
into
some
money
and
thinks
she
can
t
spend
it
any
better
than
in
hunting
down
her
father
s
murderer
now
we
ve
traced
rutherford
to
this
country
and
pretty
close
to
this
spot
he
made
a
getaway
before
trial
and
he
came
out
here
fifteen
years
ago
about
two
years
later
he
sent
back
east
for
his
kid
brother
he
d
be
about
your
age
now
what
you
say
your
name
was
garth
peter
garth
you
ll
have
to
excuse
the
sheriff
he
s
bound
to
search
your
sylvie
had
heard
the
footsteps
going
through
the
three
rooms
a
woman
named
bertha
scrane
a
distant
cousin
of
rutherford
s
to
whom
he
d
been
kind
brought
the
child
out
now
missis
what
s
your
name
bella
garth
she
said
tranquilly
i
came
out
here
with
my
husband
who
died
six
years
ago
he
s
buried
out
there
under
the
snow
i
ve
lived
here
with
my
son
and
my
son
s
yes
it
s
not
the
household
we
d
been
expecting
to
find
it
s
a
lonely
place
he
looked
at
sylvie
i
should
think
you
d
prefer
going
to
some
we
re
used
to
it
here
now
bella
answered
how
d
your
husband
happen
here
ma
am
his
health
was
poor
he
d
heard
of
this
climate
and
he
wanted
to
try
trapping
he
got
on
until
the
illness
came
so
bad
on
him
and
pete
s
done
well
ever
since
we
haven
t
suffered
no
i
guess
not
you
don
t
look
like
you
d
the
talk
went
on
an
awkward
as
to
bella
s
birthplace
her
life
before
she
came
out
her
husband
s
antecedents
she
was
extraordinarily
calm
ready
and
reasonable
with
her
replies
well
sir
the
sheriff
strolled
back
into
the
room
i
reckon
these
aren
t
the
parties
we
re
after
but
look
this
is
a
description
of
ham
rutherford
likely
you
might
have
had
a
glimpse
of
him
since
you
came
into
the
country
when
he
made
his
getaway
he
was
about
height
five
feet
eight
ugly
noticeable
eyes
manner
violent
he
was
deformed
one
leg
shorter
one
shoulder
higher
than
the
other
mouth
twisted
and
a
scar
across
the
nose
he
d
been
hurt
in
a
fire
when
he
was
a
child
sylvie
broke
into
a
spontaneous
ripple
of
mirth
the
full
measure
of
her
relief
goodness
she
said
with
utter
spontaneity
there
s
certainly
never
been
a
monster
like
that
in
this
house
has
there
pete
it
did
more
than
all
that
had
gone
before
to
convince
the
inquisitors
from
that
minute
there
was
a
distinct
relaxation
the
evening
indeed
turned
to
one
of
sociability
we
hate
to
inconvenience
you
ma
am
but
it
seems
like
at
this
distance
from
town
we
ve
got
to
ask
you
for
supper
and
a
place
to
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
thought
of
hugh
in
hiding
that
supper
and
the
evening
about
the
hearth
would
have
been
to
sylvie
a
pleasant
one
the
men
apparently
laying
aside
all
suspicion
were
entertaining
their
adventurous
lives
had
bristled
with
exciting
moving
humorous
experience
it
was
sylvie
herself
prompted
by
curiosity
believing
as
she
did
that
the
monster
the
sheriff
had
described
bore
no
possible
resemblance
to
the
man
she
loved
who
asked
suddenly
do
tell
us
about
the
man
you
re
hunting
for
now
this
rutherford
tell
us
about
what
he
the
easterner
gave
her
a
look
and
bella
seeing
it
chimed
in
yes
sure
tell
us
about
his
pete
stood
up
and
rolled
another
cigarette
try
as
he
might
to
steady
his
fingers
they
trembled
he
had
never
heard
hugh
s
story
he
did
not
want
to
hear
it
the
very
name
of
rutherford
that
had
in
what
now
seemed
to
him
another
age
belonged
to
hugh
and
to
him
was
terrible
in
his
ears
a
sickness
of
dread
seized
him
fortunately
the
eyes
of
neither
of
the
men
were
upon
him
sylvie
had
their
whole
attention
the
detective
spoke
he
was
a
storekeeper
back
in
a
university
town
way
east
where
i
came
from
he
kept
a
bookshop
and
had
a
heap
of
i
remember
him
myself
though
i
was
a
youngster
he
was
a
wonderful
astonishing
sort
of
chap
though
as
ugly
as
the
devil
had
a
great
gift
of
narration
never
told
the
truth
in
his
life
i
guess
but
that
only
made
him
all
the
more
entertaining
and
he
had
a
temper
phew
redhot
he
d
fly
out
and
storm
and
strike
in
all
directions
that
s
what
did
for
him
some
fool
quarrel
about
a
book
it
was
and
the
man
a
frequenter
of
the
shop
a
scholar
a
scientist
professor
at
the
university
accused
rutherford
of
lying
rutherford
had
a
heavy
brass
in
his
hand
the
professor
had
a
nasty
tongue
in
his
head
well
a
tongue
s
no
match
for
a
the
professor
said
too
much
called
rutherford
a
liar
and
got
a
clip
on
the
head
that
did
for
it
s
an
ugly
story
said
sylvie
bella
and
pete
retained
their
silence
murder
ain
t
pretty
telling
as
a
general
thing
remarked
the
sheriff
no
though
i
ve
heard
of
cases
where
a
man
was
justified
in
killing
another
man
i
mean
to
save
some
one
he
loved
from
dreadful
suffering
sylvie
replied
well
ma
am
i
don
t
know
about
that
i
ve
read
stories
that
make
it
look
that
way
but
in
all
my
experience
it
s
the
cowards
and
the
fools
that
kill
and
they
do
it
because
they
re
lower
down
closer
to
the
beast
or
perhaps
to
an
uncontrolled
child
than
most
of
but
there
was
a
time
bella
said
with
a
smothered
passion
when
an
insult
to
a
gentleman
s
honor
had
to
be
yes
ma
am
drawled
the
sheriff
in
them
history
days
things
was
fixed
up
to
excuse
animal
doin
s
kind
of
neater
and
easier
and
more
becomin
than
they
are
now
well
garth
can
we
have
our
beds
we
ve
kept
these
ladies
up
talkin
long
enough
your
mother
looks
plum
wore
they
slept
in
the
bed
usually
shared
by
pete
and
hugh
pete
lay
on
the
floor
in
the
not
far
from
his
brother
s
lay
there
rigid
and
feverish
staring
at
the
night
sylvie
at
bella
s
side
slept
no
better
her
imagination
went
over
and
over
the
story
of
ham
rutherford
s
crime
she
saw
the
little
dark
bookshop
the
professor
s
thin
sneering
face
the
hideous
anger
of
the
cripple
the
blow
the
dead
body
rutherford
s
arrest
and
when
her
brain
was
sick
it
would
turn
for
relief
to
the
noble
story
of
hugh
s
only
to
be
balked
by
a
sense
of
unreality
what
the
detective
had
told
briefly
and
dryly
lived
in
her
mind
convincingly
but
hugh
s
romance
that
had
glowed
on
his
tongue
now
lay
lifeless
on
her
fancy
back
her
mind
would
go
to
the
bookshop
the
gibing
professor
the
heavy
in
the
dawn
she
heard
bella
get
up
with
a
sigh
and
go
about
her
preparations
for
breakfast
but
it
was
noon
before
the
two
men
left
chapter
viii
hugh
came
up
from
his
like
a
man
risen
from
the
dead
they
helped
him
to
his
chair
before
the
fire
they
poured
coffee
down
him
rubbed
his
blue
stiff
hands
he
sat
looking
up
pitifully
his
eyes
turning
from
one
to
the
other
of
them
like
those
of
a
beaten
hound
all
the
masterfulness
all
the
bombast
had
been
crushed
out
of
him
even
the
splendor
of
his
flaring
hazel
eyes
was
dimmed
they
were
hollow
hopeless
old
for
a
long
time
he
did
not
speak
only
drank
the
coffee
and
submitted
himself
meekly
to
their
ministrations
then
at
last
he
touched
sylvie
with
a
trembling
hand
sylvie
he
whispered
brokenly
hugh
dear
you
re
safe
now
please
speak
please
laugh
you
frighten
me
more
than
anything
why
is
he
so
silent
pete
bella
tell
me
what
s
wrong
he
s
been
crouching
there
on
the
damp
cold
ground
for
hours
said
bella
not
knowing
what
might
her
voice
trembled
she
passed
a
hand
as
shaking
as
her
voice
across
hugh
s
bent
head
you
re
safe
now
you
re
safe
now
she
murmured
hugh
s
teeth
chattered
and
he
bent
closer
to
the
fire
ugh
it
was
cold
down
there
he
said
like
a
grave
sylvie
come
just
an
echo
of
his
old
imperious
fashion
it
was
though
the
look
was
that
of
a
beggar
for
alms
give
me
those
warm
little
hands
of
she
knelt
close
to
him
rubbed
his
hands
in
hers
looking
up
at
pete
with
a
tremulous
mouth
that
asked
for
advice
he
ll
be
all
right
in
a
minute
said
pete
you
talk
to
him
yes
you
talk
you
talk
do
you
remember
how
i
talked
to
you
when
you
were
afraid
of
the
bears
ah
he
drew
her
head
savagely
against
his
breast
folded
his
arms
about
it
stroked
the
hair
sylvie
is
it
all
right
can
it
be
the
same
yes
yes
why
not
were
you
frightened
not
after
the
first
after
they
had
described
you
i
knew
that
they
were
looking
for
the
wrong
man
and
then
i
felt
all
right
i
didn
t
know
poor
hugh
how
cold
and
cramped
you
were
what
a
shame
that
you
took
a
false
alarm
and
hid
yourself
i
don
t
believe
there
would
have
been
a
bit
of
danger
if
you
d
stayed
out
they
d
never
even
heard
of
you
i
her
talk
so
gay
so
strangely
at
with
reality
was
like
a
vivifying
wine
to
him
the
color
came
back
into
his
face
a
wild
sort
of
relief
lighted
his
eyes
then
it
didn
t
occur
to
you
sylvie
that
that
brute
might
have
been
me
that
the
men
might
after
all
have
been
describing
me
eh
he
asked
risking
all
his
hope
on
one
throw
she
laughed
and
lifting
herself
a
little
in
his
arms
touched
her
soft
mouth
to
his
but
hugh
you
told
me
your
story
don
t
you
remember
and
it
is
gloriously
mercifully
different
from
rutherford
he
put
his
chin
on
his
fist
and
stared
over
her
head
into
the
fire
she
felt
the
slackening
of
his
embrace
and
searched
his
arms
with
questioning
fingers
why
are
you
cross
hugh
did
i
say
anything
to
hurt
you
let
s
forget
ham
rutherford
i
wonder
where
he
is
poor
horrible
wretch
dead
dead
dead
hugh
muttered
dead
and
buried
or
he
ought
to
be
o
god
he
groaned
and
crushed
her
close
against
him
i
can
t
ask
you
to
love
me
sylvie
to
marry
me
now
you
know
what
it
is
like
to
love
a
man
who
must
be
afraid
of
other
men
what
right
have
i
to
ask
any
woman
to
share
my
life
but
hugh
if
i
love
you
and
you
do
love
me
he
asked
he
laughed
out
at
that
stood
up
drawing
her
to
stand
beside
him
bella
pete
he
called
do
you
hear
you
two
he
beckoned
them
close
laid
a
hand
on
them
drew
first
one
then
the
other
toward
sylvie
she
loves
me
she
sees
me
as
i
am
suddenly
he
put
his
grizzled
head
on
sylvie
s
shoulder
and
wept
she
felt
her
way
back
to
the
chair
sat
down
and
drew
him
to
kneel
with
his
arms
about
her
her
head
bent
over
him
her
small
hands
caressing
him
she
looked
at
pete
for
help
for
explanations
but
she
could
not
see
his
pale
tormented
face
after
a
while
hugh
was
calm
and
sat
at
her
feet
smoking
but
he
was
unnaturally
silent
and
his
eyes
brooded
upon
her
haggardly
it
was
several
days
before
hugh
regained
his
old
vigor
and
buoyancy
then
it
came
to
life
like
an
antaeus
flung
down
to
mother
earth
his
hour
of
doubt
of
of
compunction
was
whirled
away
like
an
uprooted
tree
on
the
flood
of
his
happiness
he
flung
reason
and
caution
to
the
four
winds
he
dared
bella
or
pete
to
betray
him
he
played
his
heroic
part
with
boisterous
energy
his
tongue
wagged
like
a
tipsy
troubadour
s
what
an
empty
canvas
a
palette
piled
with
rainbow
tints
a
fistful
of
clean
brushes
would
be
to
an
artist
long
starved
for
his
tools
such
was
sylvie
s
mind
to
hugh
she
was
darkness
for
him
to
scrawl
upon
with
light
she
was
the
romantic
ear
to
his
romantic
tongue
she
was
the
poet
reader
for
his
gorgeous
imagery
he
had
not
only
the
happiness
of
the
successful
lover
but
even
more
the
happiness
of
the
successful
creator
what
he
was
creating
was
the
hugh
that
might
have
been
with
sylvie
clinging
to
his
hand
he
now
went
out
singing
the
three
of
them
together
great
hugh
and
happy
artist
hugh
all
but
welded
into
one
man
for
her
and
for
her
love
those
were
splendid
days
days
of
fantastic
happiness
hugh
s
joy
his
sense
of
freedom
gave
him
a
tenfold
gift
of
fascination
yet
one
day
one
of
those
dim
moist
spring
days
more
colorful
to
hugh
s
heart
than
any
of
his
days
there
cut
into
his
consciousness
like
a
hard
thin
edge
a
sense
of
a
little
growing
change
in
sylvie
it
had
been
there
the
change
slightly
dimly
there
ever
since
the
sheriff
s
visit
it
was
not
that
she
doubted
hugh
such
a
suspicion
would
have
struck
him
instantly
aware
and
awake
but
that
she
had
become
in
some
way
uncertain
of
herself
restless
depressed
afraid
and
it
was
always
his
that
brought
the
reaction
a
curious
delicate
inner
recoil
so
delicate
and
slight
so
deep
beneath
the
threshold
of
her
consciousness
that
in
the
blind
glory
of
his
he
missed
it
altogether
might
indeed
have
gone
on
missing
it
as
she
would
have
gone
on
ignoring
or
repressing
it
if
it
had
not
been
for
their
kiss
on
the
this
was
one
of
hugh
s
madnesses
he
would
take
sylvie
up
a
mountain
and
show
her
his
kingdom
show
her
himself
as
lord
of
the
wilderness
he
had
been
there
before
many
times
to
the
top
of
their
one
mountain
always
under
protest
from
bella
and
pete
it
was
a
bare
rock
exposed
to
half
the
world
and
all
the
eyes
of
heaven
and
for
a
man
in
hiding
a
man
who
lived
yet
whose
name
was
carved
above
a
grave
it
was
a
very
target
for
untoward
accident
some
trader
or
trapper
down
in
the
forest
might
look
up
and
behold
the
misshapen
figure
black
and
bold
against
the
sky
yet
there
was
never
so
mighty
a
hugh
as
when
he
stood
there
defiant
and
alone
now
he
wanted
sylvie
to
sense
that
tragic
magnificence
so
they
went
out
hugh
s
arm
about
her
as
strange
a
pair
of
lovers
as
ever
tempted
the
spring
the
great
scarred
uncouth
gray
cripple
and
the
slim
unseeing
girl
groping
and
clinging
absolutely
shut
off
from
any
contact
with
reality
as
long
as
this
man
should
interpret
creation
for
her
sylvie
turned
back
to
wave
at
pete
whom
they
had
left
standing
in
the
doorway
i
ll
be
hunting
for
you
if
you
stay
out
late
he
called
to
which
hugh
shouted
back
you
hunting
for
us
don
t
fancy
i
can
t
take
care
of
this
child
both
of
them
blind
pete
muttered
to
himself
in
answer
they
were
moving
rather
slowly
across
the
rough
flat
and
presently
hugh
led
sylvie
into
the
fragrant
silence
of
the
forest
trail
to
her
it
was
all
scent
and
sound
hugh
whispered
to
her
what
this
drumming
meant
and
that
chattering
and
that
sudden
rattle
almost
under
their
feet
they
had
to
go
slowly
sylvie
touching
the
trees
here
and
there
along
her
side
of
the
trail
he
lifted
her
over
logs
and
fallen
trees
and
sometimes
before
he
set
her
down
he
kissed
her
then
sylvie
would
turn
her
head
shyly
and
he
would
laugh
thus
they
made
slow
sweet
progress
i
see
more
in
the
woods
with
your
eyes
than
i
ever
could
with
my
own
she
told
him
i
have
eyes
for
us
both
he
answered
that
s
why
god
gave
me
the
eyes
i
have
because
he
knew
the
use
i
d
be
making
of
is
this
the
trail
pete
follows
to
the
she
asked
i
wish
you
could
take
me
there
hugh
or
would
you
let
him
take
me
he
tightened
his
arm
i
can
t
bear
to
have
you
out
of
my
sight
he
answered
she
sighed
it
seems
so
queer
that
they
haven
t
tried
to
find
me
do
you
suppose
they
think
that
i
m
dead
did
pete
mail
my
letter
to
miss
foby
i
wonder
what
does
miss
foby
matter
he
asked
jealously
what
does
anything
matter
to
you
but
me
here
we
leave
pete
s
trail
and
i
take
you
straight
up
the
mountain
dear
one
we
ll
rest
now
and
then
when
we
get
to
the
rocky
place
just
below
the
top
i
ll
carry
you
are
you
happy
i
always
feel
as
if
my
heart
melted
with
the
snow
when
spring
comes
a
wild
free
tumbling
feeling
of
softness
and
she
sighed
yes
if
only
i
could
see
i
miss
my
eyes
out
of
doors
more
than
in
the
house
does
really
last
so
long
perhaps
it
was
the
nervous
shock
and
the
exhaustion
as
much
as
the
glare
i
am
sure
it
all
will
just
go
suddenly
some
day
i
stare
and
stare
sometimes
and
i
feel
as
if
i
might
see
he
frowned
you
mustn
t
miss
anything
when
you
have
me
sylvie
do
you
suppose
i
miss
anything
now
that
i
have
you
my
career
my
old
friends
my
old
life
my
liberty
the
world
that
for
everything
he
snapped
his
fingers
if
only
i
have
you
love
me
so
much
she
answered
as
though
she
were
oppressed
it
frightens
me
when
you
are
wholly
mine
he
began
well
wait
till
we
get
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
there
i
ll
tell
you
all
my
plans
they
re
as
big
and
beautiful
as
the
world
i
feel
with
your
love
that
i
can
move
mountains
i
can
fashion
the
world
close
to
my
heart
s
desire
we
ll
leave
this
blank
spot
and
go
to
some
lovely
warm
smiling
land
where
the
water
is
turquoise
and
the
sky
aquamarine
and
perhaps
my
sight
will
come
it
was
almost
a
prayer
he
did
not
answer
they
had
come
to
a
sharp
sudden
ascent
he
took
her
in
his
arms
scrambled
across
the
tumbled
rocks
and
set
her
down
beside
him
on
the
great
granite
crest
that
rose
like
the
edge
of
a
gray
wave
the
clean
wild
wind
smote
her
and
shook
her
and
pressed
back
her
hair
and
dress
she
clung
to
him
is
it
steep
are
we
on
the
edge
of
a
cliff
hugh
i
m
not
afraid
we
re
on
the
very
top
of
the
world
he
told
her
breathlessly
his
voice
filled
with
a
sense
of
awe
our
world
sylvie
i
m
master
here
there
s
no
greater
mind
than
my
own
in
all
that
dark
green
circle
it
s
pines
pines
pines
to
the
edge
of
the
earth
sylvie
an
ocean
of
purple
and
green
silver
where
the
wind
moves
treading
down
like
christ
walking
on
the
water
and
the
sky
is
all
gray
like
can
you
see
the
flat
the
cabin
the
flat
yes
a
round
green
spot
way
down
there
behind
us
the
cabin
no
that
s
in
a
hollow
you
may
be
sure
well
out
of
sight
i
m
an
outlaw
dearest
remember
there
s
a
curve
of
the
river
like
a
silver
elbow
and
sylvie
up
above
us
an
eagle
is
turning
and
turning
in
a
huge
circle
he
thinks
he
s
king
but
sylvie
it
s
our
world
yours
and
mine
this
is
our
she
drew
back
what
do
you
mean
haven
t
you
a
feeling
for
such
images
we
ll
go
before
a
parson
don
t
be
afraid
would
i
frighten
you
sylvie
i
love
you
too
much
for
that
why
sylvie
what
s
wrong
when
his
lips
clinging
and
compelling
had
left
hers
she
bent
her
face
to
his
arm
and
began
to
cry
oh
i
don
t
know
i
don
t
know
but
please
don
t
kiss
me
like
that
not
like
that
he
released
her
and
half
turned
but
her
hands
instantly
hunted
for
him
found
him
and
clung
hugh
don
t
be
angry
be
patient
with
me
try
to
understand
perhaps
it
s
because
i
am
in
the
dark
i
do
love
you
i
do
but
you
must
wait
soon
it
will
be
spring
for
me
too
you
don
t
understand
you
re
angry
but
i
can
t
explain
it
any
you
can
lay
your
hand
on
me
he
said
hoarsely
god
knows
i
m
real
and
he
thought
so
my
love
for
you
is
here
like
a
granite
block
i
know
it
is
the
one
thing
in
the
darkness
that
is
real
i
know
you
your
love
splendid
and
strong
and
brave
wait
just
a
little
hugh
try
to
be
patient
suddenly
it
will
all
come
right
the
fog
will
lift
then
we
ll
really
be
on
top
of
the
she
laughed
but
rather
sadly
i
will
always
hate
this
he
said
i
used
to
love
it
i
was
so
close
to
happiness
and
now
you
ve
snatched
it
out
of
my
he
drew
in
sobbing
breaths
no
it
s
myself
i
m
keeping
from
happiness
not
you
she
answered
i
know
it
will
come
right
but
you
must
not
hurry
me
dear
hugh
be
she
found
his
hand
and
raised
it
a
dead
weight
to
her
lips
please
be
patient
let
s
go
down
out
of
this
wind
i
can
t
see
your
world
and
i
m
so
in
silence
a
dull
gray
silence
hugh
led
her
down
into
the
valley
chapter
ix
they
came
down
the
hill
rapidly
and
carelessly
hugh
stung
by
pain
and
anger
threw
himself
over
the
rocks
and
sylvie
was
too
proud
to
show
her
timidity
or
to
ask
for
help
she
crept
and
climbed
up
and
down
saving
herself
with
groping
hand
letting
one
foot
test
the
distances
before
she
put
the
other
down
at
last
the
rattle
of
his
progress
sounded
so
far
below
that
she
quavered
aren
t
you
going
to
wait
for
me
hugh
he
stopped
short
and
for
a
moment
watched
her
silently
then
smitten
by
the
pathos
of
her
progress
a
little
child
she
seemed
against
the
mountain
toppling
so
close
behind
her
he
came
swinging
up
to
her
and
gave
her
his
hand
you
me
anyway
don
t
you
he
asked
with
a
tender
sort
of
roughness
she
couldn
t
answer
because
she
didn
t
want
him
to
know
that
he
had
made
her
cry
she
kept
her
face
turned
from
him
and
hurried
along
at
his
side
why
do
you
go
so
fearfully
fast
she
was
forced
at
last
to
protest
because
i
want
to
get
down
from
this
accursed
mountain
i
want
to
get
down
into
the
woods
again
where
i
was
hugh
she
pulled
at
his
arm
you
are
only
a
child
after
well
she
stopped
go
home
alone
then
i
ll
be
no
worse
off
than
when
you
found
me
the
first
time
pete
will
come
out
and
hunt
for
me
he
has
a
far
sweeter
temper
than
you
hugh
and
doesn
t
think
only
of
he
swung
away
at
that
resting
his
hand
against
a
big
rock
to
clear
a
hole
then
seeing
her
about
to
step
down
into
it
he
pivoted
back
caught
her
up
bodily
in
his
arms
and
laughing
ran
with
her
down
the
hill
bounding
over
the
rocks
leaping
over
the
crevices
while
she
clung
to
him
in
fright
you
silly
child
he
cried
this
is
the
way
i
ll
take
you
home
now
i
ve
got
you
and
i
ll
punish
you
well
she
clung
to
him
and
begged
him
to
stop
she
was
frightened
by
their
rash
plunging
progress
by
his
speech
she
struggled
let
me
down
i
won
t
be
carried
like
this
against
my
will
hugh
let
me
down
all
right
he
fairly
flung
her
from
him
on
a
grassy
spot
he
was
about
to
leave
her
when
a
rushing
rattle
sounded
above
them
the
boulder
he
had
twice
used
to
turn
his
own
weight
upon
was
charging
down
the
hillside
just
in
time
he
caught
sylvie
threw
her
to
one
side
and
fell
prone
helpless
in
the
path
of
the
slide
he
cried
out
flinging
up
his
arm
and
as
though
his
cry
had
been
of
magic
the
boulder
faltered
and
stopped
a
root
half
buried
just
above
his
body
had
made
a
hollow
and
a
ledge
it
had
rocked
the
rolling
fragment
back
up
on
its
haunches
so
to
speak
and
balanced
it
to
a
stop
hugh
hugh
sobbed
sylvie
what
was
it
are
you
hurt
she
crept
up
to
him
no
hugh
told
her
breathing
heavily
it
was
a
rolling
how
did
you
stop
it
you
must
be
hurt
crushed
my
arm
s
wrenched
not
he
had
in
fact
wrenched
it
slightly
your
poor
arm
you
were
so
quick
so
strong
you
didn
t
think
of
your
own
life
and
i
ve
been
so
cruel
hugh
hugh
kiss
hugh
took
his
reward
none
the
less
sweet
to
his
strange
nature
in
that
it
was
only
potentially
earned
and
joy
like
a
warm
flood
crept
up
again
to
his
heart
he
sat
on
the
hillside
and
held
his
small
love
close
one
of
his
arms
moved
stiffly
and
he
groaned
a
little
she
rubbed
it
for
him
you
d
better
come
home
and
let
bella
and
me
fix
it
it
may
be
badly
hurt
you
re
sure
it
isn
t
broken
she
asked
quite
lean
on
me
i
ll
help
you
down
you
can
tell
me
where
to
nonsense
he
laughed
his
very
blood
singing
warm
with
relief
a
strained
arm
won
t
hurt
my
walking
apparatus
we
had
a
lover
s
quarrel
didn
t
we
and
the
boulder
was
peacemaker
bless
the
boulder
don
t
joke
dear
you
saved
my
life
at
the
risk
of
your
own
are
you
always
doing
insane
generous
dangerous
things
think
if
you
had
been
she
shivered
do
you
suppose
my
life
is
worth
anything
to
me
without
yours
sylvie
he
bent
his
head
and
kissed
her
again
but
he
had
learned
his
lesson
and
there
was
restraint
and
timidity
in
that
kiss
the
sun
s
come
out
cried
sylvie
yes
it
s
splendidly
bright
there
s
a
clean
slit
in
the
sky
there
at
the
western
edge
the
dark
gray
cap
is
being
lifted
inch
by
inch
the
way
a
boy
lifts
his
cap
to
see
the
butterfly
he
s
caught
all
s
gold
behind
it
sylvie
burning
gold
the
rocks
are
like
bright
copper
and
the
pines
they
re
incandescent
phosphorescent
green
if
i
could
only
see
it
down
near
the
pines
a
tall
still
figure
stood
watching
them
it
was
pete
and
his
smile
usually
so
frank
and
sweet
had
now
a
sardonic
twist
as
they
came
down
out
of
their
sun
into
his
shadow
he
spoke
with
a
drag
to
his
syllables
hullo
he
said
that
was
a
narrow
escape
you
had
you
two
the
voice
might
have
been
a
for
the
start
it
gave
to
hugh
why
it
s
pete
we
must
be
late
pete
sylvie
called
joyously
did
you
see
how
hugh
saved
my
life
he
threw
himself
down
before
the
rock
and
stopped
it
he
s
hurt
his
poor
arm
the
great
stone
was
right
on
top
of
us
and
he
threw
me
out
of
the
way
and
set
his
own
strength
against
it
i
couldn
t
see
the
rock
pete
but
it
felt
like
a
it
was
big
enough
to
smash
you
both
said
pete
he
looked
at
hugh
whose
eyes
glared
in
a
strained
shamed
face
the
older
man
s
fingers
worked
nervously
he
opened
his
lips
and
closed
them
again
it
was
easy
to
understand
the
travail
of
his
mind
unwilling
to
forego
the
imaginary
bit
of
heroism
and
yet
abashed
by
the
boy
s
awareness
of
the
lie
pete
gave
one
short
laugh
then
springing
suddenly
across
a
fallen
tree
that
separated
them
he
caught
sylvie
up
into
his
arms
you
can
t
carry
her
with
a
wrenched
arm
he
said
half
gayly
half
tauntingly
and
at
the
best
rate
she
can
go
it
will
be
night
before
we
get
her
home
i
m
strong
i
ll
carry
her
sylvie
laughed
protesting
that
she
was
being
treated
like
a
doll
and
resigned
herself
to
pete
s
swift
smooth
stride
it
was
as
though
she
were
skimming
through
space
so
quietly
did
his
moccasined
feet
press
the
earth
so
exquisitely
did
his
young
strength
save
her
from
any
jar
he
whistled
softly
through
his
teeth
as
he
ran
in
long
swift
strides
and
as
he
did
not
speak
to
her
she
lay
silent
yet
strangely
peaceful
and
happy
hugh
was
left
far
behind
the
forest
fragrance
moved
cool
and
resinous
against
her
face
i
feel
as
if
we
could
go
on
and
on
forever
she
said
with
a
sigh
forever
and
ever
and
we
will
he
answered
through
his
teeth
hardly
pausing
in
his
whistling
for
the
odd
reply
we
but
for
all
that
he
set
her
gently
and
suddenly
down
and
she
knew
that
she
stood
again
at
the
cabin
door
pete
where
are
you
she
asked
but
he
had
disappeared
still
in
utter
silence
like
a
genie
whose
task
is
done
chapter
x
what
did
he
say
to
you
what
did
he
say
to
you
asked
hugh
again
and
again
sylvie
laughed
at
him
he
didn
t
say
anything
hardly
a
word
except
that
he
pretended
he
was
going
on
forever
he
said
we
will
we
that
s
absolutely
all
hugh
don
t
be
so
silly
what
he
say
i
don
t
know
hugh
answered
he
might
have
made
fun
of
fun
of
you
after
saving
my
life
i
d
have
boxed
his
ears
no
no
peter
wouldn
t
do
that
he
s
afraid
of
she
was
so
proud
of
this
that
hugh
perforce
laughed
it
was
after
supper
and
they
had
walked
a
little
way
from
the
cabin
they
were
standing
just
above
the
river
on
a
little
hillock
topped
with
three
big
pines
the
dusk
was
thick
about
them
stars
pricked
the
soft
sky
sylvie
was
wrapped
in
hugh
s
coat
and
they
were
linked
by
their
hands
hanging
at
their
sides
every
one
but
sylvie
had
been
very
silent
at
supper
but
she
had
told
her
story
of
hugh
s
heroism
again
and
again
until
finally
even
hugh
had
grumbled
at
the
what
makes
you
think
anyone
could
be
afraid
of
you
he
smiled
down
at
the
small
dark
head
which
did
not
reach
his
shoulder
he
s
afraid
i
ll
kiss
him
don
t
grip
my
hand
that
way
it
hurts
you
couldn
t
be
jealous
of
a
boy
besides
i
kiss
him
any
more
i
never
have
kissed
him
but
that
once
no
twice
when
i
told
him
that
i
was
going
to
be
his
you
told
him
that
hugh
s
voice
had
an
odd
anxiety
how
did
he
take
it
i
don
t
think
he
was
very
enthusiastic
he
loves
you
so
much
hugh
you
are
the
very
heart
of
his
universe
and
i
suppose
he
is
jealous
of
your
love
for
me
since
then
he
s
avoided
me
and
is
as
dumb
as
a
fish
when
i
talk
to
him
i
think
his
body
has
outgrown
his
mind
perhaps
i
don
t
know
he
answered
and
bella
is
so
silent
too
hugh
it
must
have
been
a
lonely
life
for
you
before
i
came
those
two
people
though
they
love
you
so
much
are
not
companionable
i
think
hugh
that
they
aren
t
able
to
understand
you
you
are
so
brilliant
and
they
are
so
dull
you
are
so
articulate
and
they
are
so
dumb
you
are
so
warm
so
quick
to
see
to
feel
to
sympathize
while
they
are
so
slow
and
so
cold
dear
hugh
i
m
glad
i
came
i
am
stupid
myself
but
i
have
enough
intelligence
to
understand
you
a
little
haven
t
i
dear
so
much
more
than
enough
the
low
speech
with
its
tremor
of
humility
was
almost
lost
what
a
noise
the
river
makes
he
said
presently
yes
and
the
pines
the
whole
air
is
full
of
rushing
and
sighing
and
clapping
and
rattling
sounds
tell
me
so
much
now
they
fill
my
whole
life
it
is
very
queer
why
a
voice
means
more
to
me
now
i
think
than
a
face
ever
did
is
it
a
deep
river
hugh
now
it
is
deep
and
dangerous
but
it
goes
down
very
quickly
when
the
snow
at
its
source
has
melted
in
summer
it
is
a
friendly
little
brook
and
in
the
fall
a
mere
trickle
that
hardly
wets
your
shoe
i
have
a
boat
here
tied
to
the
root
of
one
of
these
trees
a
boat
i
made
myself
to
pole
across
when
the
stream
is
too
deep
for
wading
i
ll
take
you
out
in
it
when
the
flood
s
down
it
wouldn
t
last
fifteen
minutes
now
in
the
spring
sylvie
a
nymph
comes
down
from
the
mountain
a
wild
white
nymph
she
has
hair
and
arms
you
can
see
her
lashing
the
water
and
if
you
listen
you
can
hear
her
sing
and
cry
let
s
go
in
dear
you
re
tired
and
cold
i
can
feel
you
shivering
we
ll
start
a
big
fire
and
i
ll
tell
you
how
that
nymph
caught
me
once
and
nearly
strangled
me
with
her
cold
wet
arms
i
was
trying
to
save
you
ll
laugh
when
i
tell
you
about
it
a
baby
pete
and
bella
made
room
for
them
silently
about
the
hearth
where
pete
had
already
built
up
a
fire
sylvie
groped
her
way
to
the
throne
from
which
the
other
woman
slipped
half
furtively
and
so
noiselessly
that
sylvie
never
guessed
her
usurpation
hugh
is
going
to
tell
us
a
story
she
said
and
rested
her
head
back
so
that
her
small
chin
pointed
out
and
her
slim
neck
was
drawn
up
a
wonderful
story
about
the
river
and
a
bear
i
hope
it
s
a
baby
bear
hugh
for
you
know
how
i
feel
about
bears
i
honestly
think
that
being
so
afraid
of
seeing
them
is
what
made
me
blind
she
gave
her
small
shy
laugh
i
thought
i
saw
them
everywhere
i
looked
that
day
and
night
it
seems
so
long
ago
now
and
yet
it
is
not
so
many
weeks
i
can
still
hear
hugh
s
voice
calling
out
to
me
across
the
snow
and
now
she
said
the
snow
s
all
gone
and
none
of
you
are
strangers
any
more
and
go
on
with
your
story
pete
added
a
log
to
the
fire
so
that
the
flames
stretched
up
bravely
and
made
a
great
fan
of
light
against
which
they
all
seemed
painted
like
ornamental
figures
hugh
lounging
along
the
rug
to
make
a
striking
central
figure
bella
was
drawn
up
rigidly
on
a
stiff
hard
chair
she
hemmed
a
long
coarse
towel
with
her
blunt
fingers
pete
sat
opposite
sylvie
on
the
floor
his
back
against
the
corner
of
the
fireplace
his
knees
drawn
up
in
his
hands
his
head
a
little
bent
he
too
from
under
his
long
level
brows
looked
for
the
most
part
at
hugh
not
devotedly
not
wistfully
but
with
a
somber
wondering
it
was
only
now
and
then
and
as
though
he
couldn
t
help
it
that
the
blue
smouldering
northern
eyes
were
turned
to
sylvie
on
her
throne
then
they
would
brighten
painfully
and
his
lips
would
tighten
so
that
the
dimple
meant
for
laughter
cut
itself
like
a
touch
of
pain
into
his
cheek
the
firelight
heightened
his
picturesqueness
the
dull
blue
of
his
shirt
open
at
the
round
smooth
throat
the
dark
of
his
corduroy
trousers
against
which
the
long
tanned
hands
knit
strongly
together
stood
out
in
the
rosy
leaping
light
beautifully
painted
against
the
background
of
old
brown
logs
yet
it
was
hugh
after
all
who
dominated
the
room
by
right
of
his
power
his
magnetism
the
very
distortion
of
his
spirit
here
in
this
lonely
square
of
light
and
warmth
surrounded
by
a
world
of
savage
lawless
winds
heightening
the
voices
of
vast
loneliness
these
three
people
were
imprisoned
by
him
a
merlin
of
the
west
he
sat
up
to
begin
his
story
pressing
tobacco
into
his
pipe
oh
it
s
not
so
much
of
a
story
sylvie
it
was
last
spring
when
the
river
was
high
and
i
d
been
out
with
my
traps
i
was
coming
home
along
the
river
edge
pretty
tired
a
big
load
on
my
back
i
came
around
a
bend
of
the
river
and
not
far
below
me
a
little
black
bear
round
as
a
barrel
was
trying
to
scramble
over
the
flood
on
a
very
shaky
log
the
mother
was
on
the
other
side
but
i
didn
t
know
that
then
well
there
s
nothing
in
god
s
world
sylvie
so
beguiling
as
a
baby
bear
this
little
fellow
was
scared
by
what
he
was
doing
but
he
was
bound
he
d
get
across
the
river
he
d
make
a
few
steps
then
he
d
back
up
and
half
rise
on
his
hind
legs
i
watched
him
a
long
time
then
he
made
up
his
mind
he
d
better
make
a
dash
for
it
he
began
scrambling
like
a
frantic
kitten
and
it
was
just
in
the
most
ticklish
spot
that
he
heard
me
and
jumped
and
went
rolling
off
into
the
river
i
tell
you
my
heart
came
right
up
into
my
oh
he
drowned
wailed
sylvie
hugh
rose
and
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
dominating
the
room
even
more
convincingly
with
his
vivid
ugliness
sylvie
s
face
turned
up
to
him
like
a
white
flower
to
the
sun
it
lives
by
without
seeing
it
was
strange
to
watch
the
adoration
the
worship
on
that
small
face
and
at
the
same
time
to
behold
the
grotesqueness
toward
which
it
was
directed
bella
was
listening
with
her
lowered
eyes
and
tightened
lips
she
was
interested
in
spite
of
herself
and
pete
s
inscrutable
face
followed
the
story
with
absorption
well
in
he
rolled
with
a
splash
and
went
rattling
down
the
current
turning
over
and
over
like
a
fool
i
threw
away
my
hides
ran
down
the
bank
and
jumped
in
after
him
that
is
i
meant
to
hold
on
to
a
branch
and
stand
out
in
the
water
and
catch
him
as
he
went
by
but
the
nymph
i
told
you
about
had
her
own
plans
she
wrapped
her
arms
round
me
and
away
we
went
bear
all
oh
yes
i
d
caught
the
cub
all
right
and
he
was
about
half
drowned
by
that
time
no
fight
left
in
him
well
for
a
bit
it
was
a
question
whether
the
world
wouldn
t
be
quickly
and
well
rid
of
us
both
but
we
tumbled
up
against
a
root
and
scrambled
out
and
when
i
d
rested
i
picked
up
limp
and
trembling
master
bear
and
went
back
for
my
hides
and
while
i
was
collecting
them
i
heard
a
sort
of
grumpy
grumbling
sound
and
i
looked
up
and
by
jove
mother
bear
was
coming
across
that
log
with
the
longest
steps
you
ever
saw
that
s
when
i
ran
to
collect
my
gun
it
was
a
little
farther
up
the
bank
than
my
hides
worse
luck
even
bella
had
forgotten
her
bitterness
in
listening
and
pete
s
parted
lips
were
those
of
an
excited
child
sylvie
leaned
forward
in
her
chair
her
cheeks
tingling
her
hands
locked
hugh
had
thrown
himself
into
the
action
of
his
story
his
face
was
slightly
contorted
as
though
sighting
along
a
his
arm
raised
the
ungainliness
of
his
deformity
strongly
accentuated
he
was
not
looking
at
sylvie
true
to
his
nature
and
his
habit
he
had
forgotten
every
one
but
that
hugh
of
adventure
and
of
romance
the
one
companion
of
his
soul
none
of
them
was
watching
sylvie
and
when
she
gave
a
sharp
little
cry
a
queer
start
and
then
sat
utterly
still
hugh
accepted
it
they
all
accepted
it
as
a
tribute
to
his
powers
but
sylvie
leaning
her
elbows
on
her
knees
raised
trembling
hands
to
her
eyes
and
hid
them
she
sat
very
still
very
white
while
the
story
went
on
vividly
imagined
picturesquely
told
when
it
was
over
and
the
mother
bear
after
a
worthy
struggle
defeated
hugh
looked
about
for
his
applause
it
came
grudgingly
from
bella
eagerly
from
pete
and
from
sylvie
in
a
sudden
extravagant
clapping
of
hands
a
ripple
of
high
excited
laughter
and
a
collapse
in
her
chair
she
had
fainted
in
a
limp
little
heap
she
came
to
in
an
instant
but
seemed
bewildered
and
unprotesting
permitted
herself
to
be
carried
to
bed
she
declared
she
felt
quite
well
again
and
wanted
only
to
be
alone
she
repeated
this
moaningly
oh
to
be
alone
hugh
seated
himself
on
the
end
of
the
bed
and
kissed
her
forehead
and
her
hand
but
it
quivered
under
his
lips
and
was
drawn
away
he
came
back
into
the
with
a
pale
bewildered
face
chapter
xi
next
day
there
came
out
of
that
room
a
new
sylvie
or
rather
a
dozen
new
sylvies
a
flighty
witch
of
a
sylvie
who
tempted
her
blindness
with
rash
ventures
about
the
rooms
and
even
out
of
doors
who
laughed
at
hugh
and
led
him
on
and
drew
him
out
to
his
maddest
improvisations
who
treated
pete
to
snubs
and
tauntings
that
stung
like
so
many
little
whips
and
again
a
sylvie
who
was
still
and
timid
and
a
trifle
furtive
who
rarely
spoke
but
sat
with
locked
hands
in
an
attitude
of
desperate
concentration
and
seemed
to
be
planning
something
secret
and
dangerous
and
then
there
was
a
haughty
sylvie
and
a
sylvie
who
mysteriously
wept
but
all
of
these
sylvies
showed
an
impetuous
new
tenderness
toward
bella
i
ve
been
all
wrong
about
you
bella
she
confessed
i
know
you
re
not
really
old
and
ugly
and
cross
at
all
let
me
touch
your
bella
awkward
and
flushed
had
no
choice
but
to
submit
to
the
flick
of
the
light
young
fingers
i
m
learning
the
touch
of
the
blind
sylvie
boasted
now
listen
isn
t
this
right
you
have
thick
straight
eyebrows
and
eyes
are
they
blue
or
brown
bella
or
bright
gray
they
re
gray
said
pete
hugh
was
watching
from
eyes
sunk
in
a
nervous
pallid
face
he
had
come
in
from
his
traps
in
the
midst
of
sylvie
s
experiment
and
she
has
a
nice
straight
strong
short
nose
and
a
mouth
that
she
holds
too
tight
loosen
your
mouth
bella
it
might
be
very
sweet
if
you
gave
it
a
chance
and
she
has
a
sharp
chin
not
pretty
your
chin
but
look
if
you
d
soften
your
hair
pull
it
over
your
ears
and
forehead
why
do
you
brush
it
back
that
way
it
be
unbecoming
and
bella
it
s
curly
or
would
be
with
a
little
freedom
what
color
is
your
hair
gray
like
my
eyes
said
bella
scarlet
now
and
trying
to
draw
herself
away
is
it
really
gray
pete
tell
me
the
truth
if
you
her
hair
is
a
very
light
brown
said
pete
flushed
as
scarlet
now
as
bella
sort
of
a
grayish
brown
you
wouldn
t
notice
any
gray
hairs
bella
i
m
sure
you
don
t
look
a
day
older
than
your
skin
feels
smooth
and
young
why
do
you
let
hugh
call
you
an
old
woman
poor
bella
i
m
afraid
you
ve
spoiled
those
two
boys
sylvie
turned
suddenly
and
imperiously
upon
the
men
and
bella
made
her
escape
not
from
the
room
for
she
was
too
stirred
too
full
of
an
excited
suspense
to
bring
herself
to
leave
from
a
far
corner
near
the
window
through
which
came
the
soft
may
wind
she
watched
them
now
pete
said
sylvie
it
s
your
turn
if
i
m
to
learn
the
touch
of
the
blind
i
must
have
practice
what
can
i
make
of
you
come
here
why
don
t
you
come
she
stamped
her
foot
my
but
you
are
badly
trained
really
hugh
you
ought
to
discipline
him
wait
until
i
am
your
hugh
started
angrily
don
t
joke
about
that
he
threatened
in
a
harsh
sudden
voice
she
turned
toward
him
with
quickness
and
bent
her
head
sidelong
as
though
listening
intently
for
what
else
he
might
have
to
say
her
lips
were
set
close
and
narrow
she
had
listened
to
him
like
this
almost
breathlessly
ever
since
her
sudden
faintness
listened
as
though
she
would
draw
his
very
soul
in
through
her
ears
he
too
flushed
it
s
life
and
death
to
me
sylvie
he
pleaded
life
and
death
life
death
she
repeated
strangely
she
stood
as
if
turning
the
speech
over
in
her
mind
then
gave
her
head
a
quick
little
shake
like
a
diver
coming
to
the
surface
of
deep
water
and
moved
a
step
toward
pete
are
you
coming
boy
or
not
i
want
to
feel
your
do
as
she
says
hugh
commanded
harshly
and
pete
came
slowly
to
her
and
stood
with
his
hands
locked
behind
him
bending
over
the
little
figure
she
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
gave
him
a
shake
and
smiled
such
a
big
strong
boy
where
s
your
face
it
winced
and
paled
under
her
touch
his
eyes
fell
shifted
could
not
meet
hugh
s
who
watched
with
unsteady
breathing
and
white
lips
your
face
is
as
smooth
as
a
girl
s
pete
what
a
wide
low
forehead
and
crisp
short
hair
it
ripples
back
from
your
temples
you
must
be
a
pretty
boy
a
neat
nose
and
a
round
hard
chin
and
oh
pete
pete
i
believe
you
have
a
dimple
how
absurd
a
great
long
dimple
like
a
slit
in
your
right
cheek
why
do
you
blink
your
eyes
so
they
re
long
eyes
with
thick
short
lashes
what
a
strong
round
neck
i
think
i
like
your
she
patted
his
cheek
the
pat
more
like
a
smart
slap
he
pulled
away
that
s
for
disobedience
come
back
i
m
not
through
with
you
where
s
your
mouth
a
big
long
mouth
pete
why
does
your
mouth
tremble
her
hand
fell
from
his
lips
and
she
turned
away
take
me
out
for
a
walk
hugh
please
she
said
this
cabin
is
stuffy
now
that
the
days
are
warm
i
want
to
sit
under
the
pines
and
listen
to
the
river
you
can
tell
me
one
of
your
wonderful
stories
about
what
does
it
mean
bella
pete
asked
breathlessly
when
hugh
had
gone
out
not
so
much
leading
the
girl
as
hurrying
after
her
to
save
her
from
the
rashness
of
her
impetuous
progress
what
does
it
mean
pete
was
as
white
as
paper
i
don
t
bella
came
over
from
the
window
and
stood
by
the
fireplace
rolling
her
arms
in
her
apron
and
shaking
her
head
she
s
a
crazy
little
witch
she
ll

thought
about

he
said
i
i
can
he
flung
himself
down
in
hugh
s
chair
and
rested
his
head
in
his
hands
bella
bent
over
him
poor
pete
it
s
cruel
for
you
and
she
added
softly
uncertainly
and
for
for
you
too
bella
he
looked
up
at
her
through
tears
she
nodded
her
head
and
her
face
worked
perhaps
you
could
take
her
back
to
her
friends
pete
and
leave
hugh
didn
t
you
hear
what
he
said
bella
life
and
death
it
would
kill
him
if
she
should
go
away
with
me
or

his
head
wait
a
few
days
you
ll
see
she
s
fighting
against
him
now
i
don
t
know
why
some
instinct
but
though
he
tells
her
so
many
lies
he
doesn
t
lie
about
one
thing
he
loves
her
he
does
love
no
no
bella
s
passion
tearing
its
way
through
her
long
habit
of
repression
was
almost
terrifying
he
loves
the
image
she
has
of
him
if
he
knew
that
she
could
see
him
as
i
do
his
love
would
shrivel
up
like
a
flower
in
a
drought
hugh
can
t
love
the
truth
he
can
t
love
anything
but
his
delusions
pete
tell
her
the
truth
for
god
s
sake

her
the
truth

her
back
her
eyesight
let
her
know
his
name
his
story
his
don
t
dare
ask
me
bella
why
not
she
seemed
to
be
out
of
breath
like
a
person
who
has
been
climbing
in
thin
air
her
lips
were
dry
because
well
would
you
do
it
yourself
ah
he
would
hate
me
if
i
did
but
you
pete
when
sylvie
loved
you
and
if
she
knew
you
she
would
surely
love
you
any
woman
would
why
then
you
could
bear
hugh
s
hatred
i
have
only
him
only
she
locked
her
hands
and
lifted
them
to
her
forehead
and
was
now
making
blind
steps
toward
the
kitchen
door
pete
followed
her
and
turning
her
about
drew
down
the
hands
from
her
face
bella
without
saying
a
word
all
these
years
under
the
first
pressure
of
sympathy
that
her
agony
had
ever
known
she
could
not
speak
she
bent
her
head
for
an
instant
against
his
arm
then
moved
away
from
him
groping
through
the
kitchen
door
back
to
her
unutterable
loneliness
pete
stood
staring
after
her
a
new
bella
this
not
the
cousin
the
little
cousin
from
the
farm
not
the
nurse
who
had
saved
him
from
hugh
s
hardness
and
told
him
limping
fairy
tales
and
doctored
his
hurts
not
the
accepted
necessity
but
a
woman
a
woman
young
yes
young
in
the
instant
when
he
had
glimpsed
her
face
broken
and
quivering
the
tight
lips
parted
and
the
hair
disarranged
about
flushed
quivering
cheeks
the
eyes
deep
with
widened
pupils
she
had
revealed
beauty
and
passion
the
two
halves
of
youth
how
blind
how
blind
hugh
had
been
blind
and
selfish
and
greedy
drinking
up
the
woman
s
heart
feeding
upon
her
youth
chapter
xii
when
you
sit
so
silent
pete
sylvie
said
softly
i
sometimes
wonder
if
you
re
not
staring
at
when
i
m
making
a
trap
he
answered
smiling
a
little
to
himself
and
instinctively
shifting
his
gaze
i
can
t
very
well
be
staring
at
you
can
i
he
was
kneeling
on
the
ground
before
the
cabin
door
she
sitting
on
the
low
step
under
the
shadow
of
the
roof
her
chin
rested
on
the
backs
of
her
hands
the
limber
wrists
bent
up
a
little
the
sleeves
slipped
away
from
her
slim
white
wrists
her
face
was
brightly
rosy
her
lips
very
red
at
once
a
little
stern
yet
very
sweet
traps
are
cruel
she
said
i
think
so
myself
but
we
have
to
make
a
living
don
t
we
aren
t
you
ashamed
of
yourself
sometimes
pete
for
making
traps
and
catching
live
things
in
them
yes
it
s
a
sort
of
deceitful
cruelty
catching
the
little
blind
wandering
wild
blind
he
repeated
blankly
then
flushed
yes
blind
but
it
wasn
t
only
that
i
what
else
ought
i
to
be
ashamed
of
of
living
on
your
he
winced
sharply
but
she
went
on
coolly
of
staying
here
in
the
wilderness
you
are
a
big
boy
now
many
a
boy
of
your
age
even
smaller
and
weaker
has
gone
out
in
the
world
to
make
his
own
way
there
s
no
reason
for
to
hide
is
there
haven
t
sacrificed
your
life
for
no
he
answered
doubtfully
but
you
see
sylvie
some
one
has
to
take
the
skins
it
isn
t
safe
for
yes
of
course
so
that
s
what
you
ll
do
all
your
life
carry
loads
to
and
fro
between
this
cabin
and
the
but
if
hugh
goes
away
himself
yes
he
asked
breathlessly
his
skillful
hands
paused
in
their
fashioning
of
a
snare
you
know
of
course
that
he
wants
to
take
me
away
with
him
to
marry
me
to
start
life
and
and
you
will
sylvie
give
me
your
advice
she
said
she
pressed
her
red
lips
together
her
face
was
bent
upon
him
as
though
she
watched
but
he
stammered
you
tell
me
all
the
time
a
dozen
times
a
day
that
i
m
badly
trained
what
good
s
my
advice
you
badly
trained
i
suppose
you
are
absurdly
unselfish
pete
she
moved
a
chip
along
the
ground
with
her
foot
but
pete
failed
to
notice
this
curious
seeing
gesture
why
what
do
you
mean
she
waited
waited
until
in
the
sickness
of
his
vague
suspense
his
hands
had
turned
cold
and
the
color
had
sucked
itself
in
irregular
heartbeats
from
his
lips
at
last
she
spoke
deliberately
you
would
lay
down
your
life
for
your
friend
she
said
it
was
almost
a
whisper
pete
s
face
went
red
and
white
and
red
again
through
the
tumult
of
his
heart
he
searched
for
loyal
words
i
love
hugh
if
that
s
what
you
mean
he
said
i
love
you
she
repeated
softly
perversely
did
you
say
hugh
or
you
pete
his
face
tightened
faint
lines
came
about
his
mouth
i
said
hugh
ah
you
love
only
him
nobody
else
in
all
the
world
her
young
and
wistful
voice
came
to
him
like
a
fragrance
he
struggled
as
though
his
spirit
were
fighting
in
deep
water
he
tried
to
remember
hugh
he
rose
up
slowly
to
meet
this
passionate
moment
and
now
he
made
a
short
step
toward
the
waiting
girl
she
waiting
breathing
fast
pete
s
arms
quivered
at
his
sides
a
hand
gripped
the
quivering
muscles
and
turned
him
about
hugh
had
come
up
behind
without
sound
on
moccasined
feet
his
face
was
gray
his
eyes
were
drawn
into
slits
his
distorted
mouth
was
trying
to
become
a
straight
hard
line
the
effort
gave
a
twitch
to
the
pale
lower
lip
sylvie
stood
up
singing
as
though
in
idleness
and
vanished
into
the
house
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
tell
whether
or
not
she
had
heard
hugh
s
arrival
what
s
the
matter
pete
stammered
like
a
boy
wakened
from
a
dream
to
behold
a
lifted
cane
let
go
my
arm
hugh
your
fingers
come
away
from
the
house
said
hugh
coldly
tightening
the
iron
grip
as
though
pete
s
wincing
gave
him
satisfaction
come
up
here
by
the
pines
i
want
to
talk
to
i
ll
come
said
pete
let
go
my
there
was
that
in
his
voice
that
compelled
obedience
hugh
s
hand
fell
and
knotted
into
a
fist
pete
walked
beside
him
up
the
abrupt
slope
of
their
hollow
to
the
little
hill
above
the
river
its
noise
was
loud
in
the
still
sunny
air
there
was
no
wind
stirring
it
was
high
noon
a
sloping
tent
of
shadow
drooped
from
the
pines
and
made
a
dark
circle
about
their
roots
in
this
transparent
purplish
tent
the
brothers
faced
each
other
pete
s
lips
were
tremulous
and
hugh
s
distorted
now
said
hugh
breathing
irregularly
and
speaking
very
low
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
think
of
no
hugh
don
t
pete
pleaded
you
ll
say
things
you
don
t
mean
unkind
things
terrible
things
i
don
t
deserve
it
from
you
you
you
think
that
i
that
i
go
on
don
t
stop
tell
me
what
i
think
i
think
that
you
that
you
it
was
an
unbearable
moment
an
impossible
atmosphere
for
the
revelation
of
a
first
love
pete
felt
stripped
and
shamed
you
think
that
i
was
telling
sylvie
that
sylvie
that
i
hugh
lifted
his
hand
and
struck
the
younger
man
sprang
back
then
forward
and
was
at
his
elder
s
throat
for
an
instant
they
struggled
silently
terribly
slipping
on
the
red
then
pete
gave
a
hard
laugh
are
we
tigers
he
asked
and
he
pulled
himself
back
and
leaned
shaking
against
a
gripping
it
with
his
hands
his
blue
eyes
were
cold
and
blazing
in
his
white
face
against
which
hugh
s
blow
had
made
a
mark
you
won
t
strike
me
again
pete
said
all
boyishness
was
gone
from
his
hard

in

of
his
bitter
and
suspicious
rage

the
justice
of

reproach

paused

about

a

on

of

one
prize
away
from

after
a
long
and
difficult
silence

put
his

half
mechanically
across
the
twisted
gasping
back
of
course
not

i
i
couldn

but
i

had
to

and
it

not

you

guessed
how
hard
it
s
been
because
you
seem
to
have
guessed
how

how
sylvie
perhaps
if

he
was
gripped

a
little
no

timidity

repeated
tonelessly
i

sorry

a
boy

you
a
few
years
ago
i
would

he
put
this
forward
as
though
it
were
a
reasonable
excuse
pete
smiled
grimly
i
can
remember
your
he
drew
himself
away

at

sternly

i
watched
you
moving
toward

not
since
i
felt
your
pete
was
silent
he
studied
the
ground
there
was
a
sullen
look
on
his
face
and
his
tightened
mouth
deepened
the
odd
incongruous
dimple
well
perhaps
you
re
right
i
he
flashed
up
a
blue
desperation
of
young
eyes
as
he
asked
how
long
will

last
hugh
not
long
not
long
surely
not

chapter
xiii
pete
looked
forward
with
impatience
to
the
day
of
his
trip
to
the
twelve
hours
of
relief
it
would
mean
from
the
worst
pressure
of
his
torment
twelve
hours
of
merciful
solitude
in
the
old
voiceful
friendliness
of
his
forest
trail
he
started
early
at
the
break
of
a
sweet
singing
dawn
the
earth
was
elastic
under
his
feet
the
air
tingling
and
mellow
with
a
taste
of
growth
the
flooded
river
chattered
loudly
like
a
creature
half
beside
itself
with
joy
pete
came
out
of
the
dark
and
silent
cabin
in
which
he
had
made
his
tiptoe
preparations
and
lifted
his
face
letting
the
light
soft
fingers
of
the
wind
cooler
and
softer
even
than
sylvie
s
smooth
out
the
knots
of
suffering
from
his
tired
brain
he
shook
his
shoulders
before
settling
them
under
the
load
of
pelts
he
would
he
swore
just
for
this
day
be
a
boy
again
he
sprang
lightly
up
from
the
hollow
and
strode
forward
with
long
swift
steps
swinging
a
companionable
stick
in
his
free
hand
loneliness
and
the
dawn
and
love
had
made
a
poet
of
the
young
man
so
that
he
had
the
release
of
poetry
and
forgot
reality
in
its
translation
into
a
tale
that
is
told
he
thought
of
sylvie
but
he
thought
of
her
as
a
man
thinks
of
a
lovely
memory
he
went
through
the
wood
with
his
chin
lifted
half
smiling
almost
happy
an
integral
part
of
the
wild
glad
wistful
spring
it
was
not
until
the
afternoon
when
he
was
nearing
the
station
just
in
fact
before
he
left
the
for
the
rutted
frontier
road
that
his
mind
was
caught
as
sharply
as
a
cloth
by
a
needle
by
the
light
sound
of
following
steps
in
the
solitude
of
that
trail
which
his
feet
alone
had
worn
the
sound
brought
him
to
a
stop
with
a
sense
of
terror
and
suspense
his
mind
leaped
to
hugh
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
loyal
life
pete
remembered
and
remembering
felt
a
creeping
on
his
skin
that
this
brother
of
his
who
had
grown
harsh
and
jealous
and
suspicious
had
been
a
murderer
the
cold
unkindly
memory
slid
along
his
senses
like
a
snake
on
the
edge
of
the
sloping
studded
with
little
yellow
flowers
just
where
the
trees
stopped
pete
set
down
his
load
and
waited
instinctively
bracing
his
body
drawing
it
back
beneath
the
shelter
of
one
of
the
big
pines
the
steps
were
light
and
swift
and
stealthy
in
the
purplish
confusion
of
the
distance
a
tangled
and
yet
ordered
regiment
of
trunks
and
boughs
and
through
which
the
uncertain
trail
seemed
to
rise
like
a
slender
thread
of
smoke
to
the
pale
flecked
sky
pete
made
out
a
moving
shape
it
slipped
in
and
out
it
hesitated
hurried
paused
moved
on
with
a
shudder
of
relief
and
of
surprise
pete
saw
it
out
from
behind
the
great
close
trunks
came
sylvie
her
chin
lifted
her
hands
stretched
out
on
either
side
brushing
the
swinging
branches
along
the
trail
her
small
head
turning
from
this
side
to
that
as
though
she
listened
in
suspense
pete
called
out
her
name
and
ran
quickly
to
meet
her
forgetting
his
part
of
a
dull
sullen
boy
he
spoke
eagerly
catching
her
hand
watching
the
warm
happy
blush
flow
in
her
cheeks
where
were
you
she
asked
she
had
stood
to
wait
for
him
as
soon
as
his
voice
reached
her
i
couldn
t
see
i
mean
i
lost
the
sound
of
your
steps
i
ve
been
following
you
for
hours
and
hours
and
hours
i
was
so
afraid
of
being
lost
again
that
i
didn
t
dare
drop
too
far
but
why
didn
t
you
call
to
me
why
have
you
come
is
anything
wrong
at
home
her
fingers
moved
uncertainly
in
his
grasp
like
the
fingers
of
a
shy
child
nothing
is
wrong
i
wanted
to
come
with
you
i
wanted
to
go
to
the
and
the
i
didn
t
dare
ask
you
to
take
me
with
you
i
was
afraid
you
d
send
me
home
i
suppose
i
ll
be
a
nuisance
but
oh
pete
please
be
nice
to
me
and
take
care
of
me
won
t
you
she
paused
turned
her
face
away
from
him
and
smiled
after
all
since
you
have
called
me
your
wife
before
witnesses
you
ought
to
introduce
me
to
your
friends
at
the
oughtn
t
you
they
might
think
it
was
queer
that
i
should
hide
myself
now
that
the
snow
has
he
dropped
her
hand
suddenly
he
realized
the
consequences
the
necessary
effect
upon
hugh
of
this
willful
venture
of
hers
does
hugh
know
where
you
are
he
asked
painfully
no
i
ran
away
i
heard
you
getting
ready
and
i
just
felt
that
i
couldn
t
bear
to
be
left
behind
i
slipped
out
of
bed
so
quietly
that
bella
didn
t
even
stir
and
i
dressed
just
as
quietly
and
when
you
had
gone
half
across
the
clearing
i
ran
out
after
you
listening
to
your
steps
you
see
i
have
the
hearing
as
well
as
the
touch
of
the
this
was
said
with
a
cunning
sort
of
recklessness
but
pete
absorbed
in
his
anxiety
did
not
challenge
the
improbable
statement
please
don
t
be
angry
with
me
she
touched
his
hand
where
it
hung
at
his
side
can
t
i
have
my
adventure
let
s
call
it
in
spite
of
himself
the
young
man
s
pulse
quickened
but
his
face
and
voice
were
stern
do
you
know
that
we
ll
be
very
late
he
said
it
will
be
midnight
before
we
can
possibly
make
it
back
to
the
cabin
if
you
can
even
do
it
at
all
you
ll
have
to
spend
the
night
somewhere
at
the
station
what
will
they
think
they
will
be
anxious
bella
and
but
what
can
they
think
her
cheeks
were
unexplainably
scarlet
if
i
choose
to
trust
you
to
take
care
of
me
why
should
they
grumble
and
i
won
t
have
to
spend
the
night
you
don
t
know
how
strong
i
am
i
m
very
strong
i
don
t
feel
tired
we
ll
go
back
by
moonlight
there
s
a
beautiful
it
will
be
almost
he
made
a
reckless
gesture
well
it
s
too
late
to
think
of
that
now
come
he
threw
himself
down
the
bank
held
up
his
hands
to
catch
hers
and
swung
her
down
beside
him
the
sun
slanted
warmly
along
the
road
and
just
ahead
flickered
the
blue
ripples
of
a
lake
sylvie
moved
quickly
and
easily
beside
him
barely
touching
his
arm
with
her
hand
she
seemed
definitely
to
decide
to
put
away
her
childishness
she
treated
him
as
though
she
had
forgotten
his
supposed
youth
she
talked
straightforwardly
with
a
certain
dignity
about
her
childhood
about
her
amusing
and
pitiful
experience
as
a
little
actress
and
she
asked
him
a
question
now
and
then
half
diffidently
which
he
answered
in
stumbling
careful
speech
always
weighed
upon
by
his
promise
by
the
deception
he
must
practice
by
the
dread
of
what
must
come
nevertheless
minute
by
minute
his
pulse
quickened
this
god
be
thanked
would
mean
the
end
the
insufferable
knot
of
circumstance
so
fantastic
so
extravagantly
unlivable
and
unreal
would
break
hugh
would
tear
the
tangle
of
his
making
to
tatters
with
angry
hands
when
they
got
back
his
difficult
trust
in
pete
s
promise
would
go
down
under
the
strain
of
these
long
and
unexplained
hours
of
sylvie
s
absence
in
his
company
it
was
the
last
act
in
the
extravaganza
queer
and
painful
that
had
twisted
them
all
out
of
their
real
shapes
for
the
confusion
of
a
blind
waif
this
adventure
that
sylvie
s
impatience
had
planned
would
bring
down
the
curtain
after
all
no
matter
what
came
of
it
pete
was
glad
the
color
warmed
his
face
his
blue
eyes
deepened
he
smiled
down
at
sylvie
beside
him
for
this
hour
she
seemed
to
belong
to
him
rightfully
naturally
by
her
own
will
he
let
go
of
his
inhibitions
and
resigned
himself
to
fate
when
on
the
far
shore
of
the
lake
the
low
walls
of
the
came
in
sight
a
double
image
reflected
faithfully
with
the
strip
of
sand
at
its
door
the
low
level
wall
of
pines
behind
and
the
blue
still
sky
above
pete
caught
the
girl
s
hand
in
his
here
we
are
sylvie
he
said
keep
quiet
and
follow
my
lead
remember
now
that
i
am
supposed
to
be
your
husband
and
you
my
wife
can
you
play
that
part
she
nodded
bending
down
her
face
so
that
he
saw
only
the
tip
of
her
small
sunburnt
chin
she
was
hatless
the
sun
struck
blue
bright
lines
in
her
black
hair
i
ll
be
careful
she
pressed
his
hand
and
he
returned
the
pressure
the
station
was
full
of
silent
curiosity
a
couple
of
squaws
a
serious
buck
indian
and
a
bearded
trapper
or
two
made
little
secret
of
their
observation
in
the
far
corner
of
the
big
bare
room
down
one
side
of
which
ran
a
long
and
littered
counter
there
was
another
even
more
interested
spectator
of
the
young
couple
s
entrance
he
sat
at
a
small
table
under
one
of
the
high
unshaded
windows
and
from
over
a
he
gave
them
a
large
and
heavy
share
of
his
attention
he
was
a
man
of
middle
age
and
sturdy
build
round
dressed
in
eastern
outing
clothes
of
dignified
correctness
he
put
on
a
pair
of
glasses
to
peer
closer
at
the
two
who
came
in
hand
in
hand
like
adventuring
children
with
the
lithe
grace
of
wild
things
a
tall
and
sallow
man
behind
the
counter
smiled
under
his
long
ragged
blond
mustache
and
made
a
gesture
of
polite
greeting
well
you
ve
sure
kept
us
in
the
dark
as
to
your
movements
peter
garth
we
had
no
notion
there
was
a
bride
in
these
parts
until
the
sheriff
brought
us
back
word
the
other
day
ma
am
i
m
glad
to
make
your
he
glanced
keenly
and
curiously
at
sylvie
s
averted
face
i
d
have
been
here
before
she
said
but
i
ve
been
suffering
from
ah
that
s
bad
sometimes
your
eyes
are
better
now
i
think
i
can
give
you
a
lotion
sylvie
and
he
discussed
the
lotion
while
pete
stood
drawn
up
proud
and
silent
his
cheeks
flushed
waiting
to
dispose
of
his
pelts
the
bartering
prolonged
itself
in
spite
of
his
best
endeavors
sylvie
seemed
to
have
no
sense
of
peril
or
anxiety
she
insisted
upon
taking
a
bite
of
early
supper
forced
coffee
and
bread
and
meat
upon
her
companion
and
chatted
affably
pete
saw
that
the
eastern
stranger
had
riveted
upon
her
his
attention
that
he
observed
every
gesture
listened
to
every
word
and
while
she
ate
that
he
walked
over
and
asked
a
few
murmured
questions
of
the
trader
nodding
his
head
then
shaking
it
over
the
answers
as
though
they
confirmed
some
suspicion
or
anxiety
at
last
pete
could
bear
the
delay
no
longer
gruffly
he
bade
sylvie
come
with
him
he
caught
her
hand
and
led
her
out
she
looking
back
over
her
shoulder
like
a
loath
child
they
had
gone
but
a
few
yards
along
the
beach
trail
when
the
sober
solid
gentleman
came
out
across
the
porch
and
waved
his
hand
to
them
pete
hastened
his
steps
without
replying
then
came
a
summons
in
a
loud
full
authoritative
voice
hi
there
one
moment
it
was
already
evening
the
lake
was
ruffled
rosily
under
a
sunset
light
pete
stopped
and
turned
he
waited
pale
tightlipped
and
formidable
sylvie
moved
a
little
closer
to
him
this
mysterious
summons
gave
her
a
first
little
spasm
of
distrust
and
fear
the
man
s
square
body
and
square
serious
face
bore
down
upon
them
freighted
with
incongruous
judgments
he
came
sturdily
defying
the
unspoken
threat
of
loneliness
he
spoke
when
he
came
up
to
them
spoke
with
evident
effort
my
friends
he
said
i
am
a
minister
of
the
gospel
and
though
my
mission
in
this
wilderness
does
not
rightly
include
you
in
its
ministrations
still
my
conscience
the
commands
of
my
master
will
not
allow
me
to
neglect
so
obvious
and
urgent
a
call
for
spiritual
he
cleared
his
throat
your
name
i
didn
t
catch
he
said
doubtfully
and
pete
did
not
supply
the
knowledge
but
i
heard
you
introduce
this
young
woman
as
your
wife
i
watched
her
very
closely
i
watched
you
too
sir
i
took
the
liberty
of
making
some
inquiries
about
you
i
have
had
much
and
varied
experience
in
the
study
of
human
here
he
put
out
a
broad
clean
hand
with
square
and
lifted
sylvie
s
brown
unwilling
left
hand
high
from
her
side
i
am
a
minister
of
the
gospel
he
repeated
in
a
land
where
such
a
symbol
is
thought
much
of
this
woman
has
no
there
is
no
register
of
your
marriage
here
in
the
one
spot
where
such
a
registration
might
have
been
most
conveniently
made
sylvie
jerked
away
her
fingers
pete
laid
down
his
load
and
slowly
drew
his
right
hand
into
a
terrible
fist
no
no
the
fingers
were
lifted
deprecatingly
you
must
not
be
angry
with
me
my
children
i
am
not
here
to
judge
you
i
have
no
knowledge
of
your
temptation
of
your
difficulties
you
have
met
and
loved
in
a
wild
and
difficult
land
i
was
not
even
sure
of
my
surmise
now
however
your
silence
and
your
anger
confirm
my
opinion
i
want
only
to
offer
you
my
services
will
you
continue
in
your
life
and
love
as
i
have
seen
them
to
be
or
will
you
if
only
for
the
sake
of
other
lives
not
yet
your
responsibility
perhaps
will
you
take
advantage
of
this
opportunity
which
god
has
now
given
you
and
let
me
make
you
indeed
man
and
wife
pete
s
fist
was
still
terrible
and
his
lips
were
gathering
their
words
when
sylvie
unbelievably
spoke
pete
she
asked
tremulously
and
he
felt
her
drawing
even
closer
to
his
side
pete
don
t
you
want
you
want
i
know
i
mean
will
you
would
you
marry
me
he
was
dumb
as
a
rock
and
gray
his
hand
opened
he
stared
from
her
to
the
impossible
intruder
the
worker
of
the
miracle
or
rather
for
he
felt
like
a
beast
trapped
the
strange
layer
of
the
snare
for
an
instant
the
lake
and
the
forest
and
the
red
sky
turned
in
a
great
wheel
before
his
eyes
then
he
caught
sylvie
s
wrist
almost
brutally
in
his
hand
be
quiet
he
said
it
was
the
savage
speaking
to
his
woman
you
ve
gone
mad
come
with
me
as
for
you
sir
my
marrying
or
not
marrying
is
none
of
your
business
the
minister
looked
sadly
up
into
the
young
man
s
white
and
rigid
face
god
be
with
you
he
bowed
turned
and
walked
back
along
the
beach
hands
locked
behind
his
broad
tweed
back
his
head
bent
pete
tightened
his
grip
on
sylvie
s
arm
come
he
said
to
her
as
harshly
as
before
we
must
hurry
it
s
nearly
sylvie
set
her
small
teeth
tight
bent
down
her
head
and
followed
him
without
a
word
their
silence
seemed
to
grow
into
a
pressure
a
weight
it
bent
pete
s
shoulders
and
sylvie
s
slender
neck
and
whitened
their
lips
all
that
they
did
not
dare
to
say
aloud
bulked
itself
huge
and
thunderous
before
the
combined
consciousness
which
makes
a
strange
third
companion
in
such
dual
silences
they
dared
not
pause
or
look
at
each
other
or
move
their
strained
lips
for
fear
truth
the
desperate
treacherous
truth
would
leap
out
and
link
them
like
a
the
somber
forest
enveloped
them
they
moved
through
it
as
through
a
deep
wall
that
opened
by
enchantment
the
moon
came
up
gibbous
and
white
and
glittering
paler
than
silver
and
the
forest
became
streaked
and
mottled
with
its
light
a
soft
sudden
wind
tore
the
light
and
shade
into
eerie
dancing
ribbons
and
tatters
and
shreds
there
were
such
sounds
as
are
not
heard
in
daylight
moon
sounds
and
cloud
sounds
and
sounds
of
dark
wind
branches
talked
and
other
small
voices
answered
in
anxious
undertones
a
moose
rubbed
his
antlers
and
coughed
they
heard
his
big
body
hulking
through
a
swamp
down
there
in
a
well
of
darkness
i
can
t
go
so
sylvie
s
shaken
voice
moved
doubtfully
i
m
she
pulled
at
his
arm
and
stopped
the
whole
forest
seemed
to
sway
and
stir
and
urge
them
to
haste
and
secrecy
a
storm
s
coming
pete
answered
i
can
t
carry
you
sylvie
unless
i
leave
my
do
you
think
i
d
let
you
carry
me
she
answered
through
her
set
teeth
i
d
rather
die
here
than
let
you
lift
me
up
in
your
arms
i
ll
go
on
till
i
drop
i
don
t
care
for
the
storm
but
i
can
t
walk
so
fast
how
can
you
see
the
moon
isn
t
can
t
be
i
mean
very
very
bright
here
in
the
the
moon
there
s
a
big
just
going
to
wipe
it
out
listen
don
t
you
hear
that
thunder
that
wind
the
storm
blew
its
distant
trumpets
shouted
louder
trampled
the
world
with
great
steps
crashed
and
came
upon
them
with
a
wet
cold
blast
they
were
stunned
with
noise
dazzled
with
flashes
smothered
and
beaten
with
long
wet
whips
under
a
big
rocking
pine
which
shouted
with
a
hundred
confused
tongues
they
found
a
dangerous
shelter
not
far
from
them
a
tree
was
struck
splitting
their
ears
half
stunning
them
when
the
worst
was
over
pete
drew
sylvie
out
relentlessly
and
started
in
the
heavily
falling
rain
the
storm
was
drawing
away
but
the
night
was
still
impenetrably
black
they
walked
for
a
few
groping
yards
when
pete
gave
a
sudden
desperate
laugh
and
stopped
what
s
the
good
of
this
we
re
off
the
trail
we
ll
have
to
wait
for
the
light
my
god
how
cold
and
wet
and
trembling
you
he
threw
down
his
pack
took
off
his
coat
wet
only
on
the
outside
and
wrapped
it
closely
about
her
she
felt
that
he
parted
branches
for
her
and
she
knew
that
they
were
in
a
dry
still
scented
place
whose
walls
stirred
and
breathed
she
sank
down
beside
him
on
the
smooth
and
crept
close
they
were
giddy
beaten
and
confused
they
felt
each
other
s
trembling
warmth
for
greater
comfort
she
tucked
her
hands
under
his
arm
her
head
dropped
back
against
his
shoulder
so
that
her
breath
fell
on
his
cheek
he
felt
the
silent
tears
of
her
humiliation
hot
and
bitter
and
human
after
the
cold
impersonal
wetness
of
rain
it
was
as
though
a
hand
drew
them
together
in
the
darkness
they
moved
numbly
at
the
same
instant
by
the
same
impulse
then
with
a
sort
of
convulsion
they
were
in
each
other
s
arms
cold
wet
tremulous
their
lips
met
the
night
became
the
beating
of
a
heart
chapter
xiv
hugh
sat
in
his
great
carved
chair
his
hands
laid
out
across
the
bulky
arms
his
head
bent
forward
a
little
so
that
his
eyes
encompassed
all
the
restless
beauty
of
the
fire
after
nightfall
when
the
wind
began
to
shake
the
cabin
he
had
built
up
the
fire
and
its
light
now
fought
ruddily
against
the
whiteness
of
the
moon
hugh
had
not
lighted
his
lamp
nor
let
bella
light
it
but
he
told
her
to
make
some
strong
coffee
and
keep
it
hot
on
the
stove
when
sylvie
comes
in
he
had
said
she
ll
be
exhausted
we
ll
give
her
a
hot
drink
and
send
her
to
bed
eh
bella
the
foolish
child
this
had
been
said
softly
but
with
a
wild
look
which
bella
could
not
meet
it
was
her
belief
that
pete
and
sylvie
had
gone
not
to
return
that
night
or
any
other
night
in
a
desperate
still
fashion
she
guarded
this
flaming
conviction
peering
up
from
long
contemplations
of
it
to
learn
whether
there
flickered
any
light
of
torment
on
hugh
s
face
but
all
day
after
the
queer
blankness
of
face
and
eyes
with
which
he
had
first
received
her
news
of
sylvie
s
disappearance
he
had
been
alternately
gay
and
tranquil
all
morning
he
had
mended
his
boat
and
in
the
afternoon
he
had
cleaned
his
gun
and
whenever
he
could
cajole
bella
into
being
his
audience
he
had
talked
his
talk
was
all
of
sylvie
of
her
pretty
childishness
her
sweet
wayward
ways
of
her
shyness
her
timidity
and
later
when
supper
was
cleared
away
and
he
had
throned
himself
in
the
center
of
that
familiar
circle
of
firelight
he
had
dropped
his
beautiful
voice
to
a
lower
key
and
had
boasted
of
sylvie
s
love
for
him
bella
sat
on
a
big
log
sawed
to
the
height
of
a
low
stool
she
sat
with
her
face
bent
down
between
her
hands
as
though
she
were
saving
her
eyes
from
the
fire
but
those
bright
devoted
eyes
never
left
hugh
s
face
though
sometimes
they
made
of
it
but
a
blurred
image
set
in
the
broken
crystals
of
her
tears
thus
together
they
heard
the
first
rumble
of
the
storm
and
saw
the
white
squares
of
moonlight
wiped
from
the
floor
as
with
a
dark
cloth
next
the
windows
seemed
to
jump
at
them
and
jump
away
lightning
said
hugh
she
ll
be
afraid
will
pete
be
able
to
comfort
her
will
he
bella
then
because
she
took
courage
to
look
into
his
face
she
saw
that
his
heart
had
been
burnt
all
day
but
that
his
faith
stronger
than
his
fear
had
kept
the
flame
smothered
almost
below
his
consciousness
while
the
storm
raged
across
their
roof
beat
a
brutal
tattoo
close
above
their
deafened
heads
pushed
at
the
door
drove
a
pool
of
water
under
the
threshold
hugh
walked
up
and
down
to
and
fro
from
fire
to
window
from
door
to
wall
but
not
fast
rather
with
a
sort
of
stateliness
sometimes
he
looked
sidelong
at
bella
s
expressionless
listening
face
at
last
he
forced
himself
back
to
the
chair
and
sat
there
mechanically
polishing
the
barrel
of
his
gun
but
his
tongue
still
spoke
the
saga
of
illusion
it
stopped
when
the
storm
dropped
into
the
bottomless
silence
of
dawn
then
there
was
only
the
dripping
from
their
eaves
hugh
sat
there
very
white
his
gun
laid
across
his
lap
bella
as
white
lifted
her
face
they
re
coming
she
whispered
and
got
stiffly
to
her
feet
hugh
moved
back
into
his
chair
turning
sidewise
and
gathering
himself
as
though
for
a
spring
his
nervous
hands
clutched
at
his
gun
upon
the
silence
the
door
opened
and
pete
and
sylvie
came
into
the
room
wet
and
and
beautiful
they
were
with
scarlet
cheeks
pete
came
quickly
over
to
hugh
s
chair
he
let
fall
his
pack
and
gazed
resolutely
down
at
his
brother
s
face
sylvie
had
a
fancy
to
come
with
me
to
the
he
said
she
came
out
after
me
and
didn
t
overtake
me
until
just
where
the
trail
comes
out
into
the
road
we
hurried
back
but
the
storm
caught
us
it
was
in
the
woods
we
couldn
t
keep
the
trail
we
had
to
wait
for
daylight
i
hope
you
weren
t
too
anxious
about
her
bella
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
could
you
make
us
some
hot
coffee
and
help
sylvie
into
some
dry
clothes
we
are
properly
drenched
both
of
this
speaker
of
terse
authoritative
sentences
was
not
the
boy
that
had
gone
out
that
morning
that
boy
was
gone
forever
hugh
stood
up
and
looked
slowly
from
sylvie
who
had
stayed
near
the
door
and
held
her
head
up
like
a
queen
to
pete
where
were
you
he
asked
gently
where
were
you
while
it
stormed
pete
moved
toward
the
fire
holding
out
his
hands
ugh
he
shivered
i
m
numb
with
where
were
you
hugh
repeated
during
the
storm
pete
lifted
his
eyes
slowly
they
were
bluer
than
the
blue
heart
of
a
sapphire
under
a
he
answered
casually
enough
and
then
just
as
hugh
would
have
smiled
the
color
creeping
up
into
his
lips
pete
s
young
and
honest
blood
poured
over
his
forehead
engulfing
him
blazing
the
truth
across
his
face
bella
saw
it
and
clenched
her
hands
sylvie
s
cheeks
too
caught
fire
hugh
turned
from
him
blinded
by
terror
saw
sylvie
s
trembling
mouth
in
her
dyed
countenance
and
turned
back
he
lifted
the
hand
that
had
held
all
this
while
to
the
chair
and
balled
it
into
a
fist
don
t
strike
him
said
sylvie
quietly
not
moving
from
her
place
by
the
door
don
t
ever
strike
him
again
hugh
s
bones
seemed
to
crumble
his
knees
bent
he
leaned
back
against
the
chair
holding
to
it
behind
him
with
both
hands
the
gun
clattered
to
the
floor
in
the
silence
sylvie
walked
across
the
room
and
lifted
her
face
as
if
for
the
first
time
they
saw
her
eyes
black
and
brilliant
and
young
sharpening
the
softness
of
her
features
she
looked
at
hugh
mercilessly
pitilessly
i
ve
been
able
to
see
you
for
a
long
time
now
ham
rutherford
she
said
and
the
instant
i
first
saw
you
i
knew
your
name
ever
since
the
night
you
told
me
that
story
about
the
river
i
ve
been
watching
you
you
are
a
great
and
infamous
liar

i
know
that
you
once
killed
a
man
for
telling
you
that
kill
me
if
you
like
for
i
am
going
to
repeat
it
after
him
a
liar
hideous
and
deformed
outside
and
in
i
have
no
pity
for
a
liar
not
even
your
physical
misfortune
shall
shield
you
you
have
made
too
great
a
mockery
of
it
you
brought
me
here
blind
as
helpless
as
one
of
the
things
you
catch
in
your
traps
and
you
played
the
hero
with
me
and
you
fed
me
with
lies
and
lies
and
lies
i
ve
eaten
and
drunk
them
until
i
m
sick
now
stand
up
and
look
at
the
truth
you
are
to
eat
that
until
are
no
bella
no
pete
i
m
going
to
speak
no
one
can
stop
me
i
know
you
love
him
how
you
can
look
at
him
and
see
him
as
he
is
and
know
what
he
has
done
and
still
love
him
i
can
t
understand
now
hugh
garth
the
name
you
tried
to
make
me
love
you
by
i
ll
tell
these
people
that
love
you
some
of
the
beautiful
fables
with
which
you
tried
to
win
love
maybe
then
they
will
begin
to
see
you
as
you
are
here
is
the
first
there
was
once
a
very
noble
youth
who
had
a
friend
don
t
hugh
groaned
pitifully
his
head
bent
before
her
perhaps
i
won
t
after
all
it
s
not
interesting
unless
you
re
fool
enough
or
blind
enough
to
be
tricked
into
fancying
it
s
the
truth
but
let
me
tell
them
some
of
the
other
things
this
noble
youth
this
man
sacrificed
his
life
for
his
friend
and
bore
the
blame
of
that
friend
s
guilt
he
is
as
handsome
as
a
viking
the
very
ideal
of
a
girl
s
imagination
strong
and
shapely
and
graceful
has
he
a
humped
shoulder
and
a
lame
leg
and
a
scarred
face
revealing
his
scarred
soul
answer
hugh
flinched
as
though
under
a
lash
pete
put
out
his
hand
uncertainly
his
face
was
drawn
with
pain
sylvie
stop
you
stop
you
re
too
cruel
he
did
lie
to
you
but
remember
that
was
because
he
the
brilliant
black
eyes
flashed
back
at
him
because
he
loved
me
you
were
going
to
say
when
you
love
a
woman
do
you
try
to
ruin
her
life
do
you
creep
up
in
the
dark
under
cover
of
her
blindness
and
touch
her
with
some
dreadful
poisonous
wound
you
don
t
know
my
horror
of
that
man
pete
oh
he
kissed
kissed
me
she
shivered
a
murderer
yes
a
murderer
oh
ham
rutherford
if
i
could
only
you
see
yourself
if
i
could
give
you
my
eyes
when
they
opened
and
i
saw
pete
s
beauty
and
bella
s
sweetness
and
the
horrible
ugliness
of
you
and
then
day
by
day
you
see
i
was
afraid
to
let
you
know
that
i
seen
you
i
was
in
terror
of
you
of
what
you
might
do
to
me
i
was
afraid
of
you
all
you
had
all
deceived
me
day
by
day
i
learned
the
utter
distortion
of
you
mind
body
and
soul
how
could
i
help
but
but
she
faltered
and
half
turned
to
pete
holding
out
her
hands
her
indignation
at
the
treachery
practiced
upon
her
an
anger
that
had
grown
in
silence
to
unbearable
heat
had
spent
itself
in
words
she
was
all
for
consolation
now
for
sympathy
but
pete
stepped
back
from
her
he
was
looking
at
hugh
and
his
clear
young
face
was
an
open
wound
hugh
pushed
himself
up
and
slowly
lifted
his
face
it
was
then
that
he
saw
sylvie
s
hands
stretched
out
to
pete
he
started
no
one
knew
what
the
convulsive
movement
meant
but
as
he
started
the
gun
tripped
him
he
caught
it
up
carelessly
blindly
there
was
a
flash
a
crash
pete
leaped
and
bent
holding
his
arm
blood
spurted
between
his
fingers
soaking
his
wet
sleeve
and
sylvie
crying
aloud
wrapped
him
in
trembling
protective
arms
i
m
not
much
hurt
he
said
half
dazedly
it
it
was
an
accident
he
didn
t
mean
it
i
was
looking
at
him
the
gun
went
off
he
didn
t
shoot
at
me
the
man
was
staring
straight
ahead
of
him
and
now
he
drew
his
hand
across
his
eyes
the
fingers
crooked
as
though
they
tore
a
veil
now
he
said
i
do
see
myself
just
as
i
am
yes
i
did
shoot
at
you
yes
i
think
i
meant
to
kill
you
i
must
have
meant
to
kill
you
that
s
the
truth
for
the
second
time
i
m
a
murderer
yet
now
as
god
lives
even
if
i
am
down
in
the
dust
i
ll
lay
hold
of
my
stars
i
m
going
to
walk
out
of
your
lives
so
that
they
can
shape
themselves
to
their
own
good
ends
sylvie
can
shape
yours
with
you
he
hesitated
a
moment
if
a
coward
a
murderer
can
say
god
bless
you
take
that
blessing
he
picked
up
his
gun
and
shuffled
across
the
floor
flinching
aside
from
bella
as
though
he
could
bear
no
further
touch
or
word
and
went
out
of
the
door
letting
in
the
brightness
of
the
sunrise
pete
had
sunk
into
a
chair
faint
from
the
shock
and
weakness
of
his
wound
and
sylvie
bent
over
him
for
a
minute
in
great
and
bitter
loneliness
bella
stood
and
watched
them
then
she
followed
hugh
he
had
put
down
his
gun
and
gone
slowly
up
from
the
hollow
and
was
walking
along
the
he
had
the
look
of
a
man
who
strolls
in
meditation
when
he
came
to
his
boat
where
it
lay
near
the
roots
of
the
three
big
pines
he
turned
it
over
he
had
been
mending
its
bottom
the
morning
of
yesterday
and
began
to
push
it
down
toward
the
plunging
stream
the
glitter
of
morning
took
all
the
swirlings
and
ripplings
and
plungings
of
the
swift
water
in
its
golden
hands
hugh
steadied
the
boat
above
him
on
the
bank
bella
spoke
quietly
hugh
she
said
look
up
at
me
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
lifted
his
face
still
holding
to
the
boat
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
repeated
why
do
you
want
to
know
you
ve
heard
the
she
came
down
the
bank
and
stood
beside
him
so
close
that
her
hair
loosened
by
the
wind
was
blown
against
his
shoulder
she
pressed
it
back
and
gazed
into
his
eyes
the
inner
glow
had
worn
through
at
last
she
was
all
warmth
all
flame
now
she
smiled
with
soft
and
parted
lips
do
you
think
that
was
the
truth
of
you
my
dear
she
said
truth
of
you
i
have
always
seen
you
as
you
are
but
she
drew
a
big
breath
like
a
climber
who
has
reached
the
height
but
i
came
to
you
didn
t
i
hugh
s
eyes
widened
the
pupils
swallowing
her
light
you
you
came
to
me
not
for
pete
s
sake
never
for
his
but
bella
you
laughed
at
yes
once
for
your
poor
folly
in
trying
to
be
what
you
are
not
when
have
i
ever
laughed
at
what
you
are
it
s
what
you
are
i
ve
loved
my
dear
just
what
you
are
a
tormented
child
only
be
honest
with
me
hugh
tell
me
what
do
you
want
the
moon
now
or
or
all
the
truth
i
want
the
truth
and
the
end
he
said
i
m
going
down
the
she
glanced
at
the
flood
as
though
it
were
a
brook
i
am
going
with
you
then
you
must
take
me
my
life
has
always
been
he
laid
one
of
his
hands
on
either
of
her
cheeks
so
that
her
face
was
framed
for
him
to
read
it
was
flushed
the
deep
eyes
were
beautiful
you
all
these
empty
years
it
was
as
though
he
saw
her
now
for
the
first
time
the
revelation
dazzled
him
i
ve
gone
thirsty
with
wine
at
my
elbow
until
it
s
too
he
shook
his
shoulders
come
with
me
then
if
you
she
stepped
into
the
boat
and
sat
in
the
stern
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
her
eyes
in
their
great
and
sudden
beauty
still
fixed
on
his
face
the
wind
blew
her
hair
wildly
in
a
long
streaming
veil
across
her
forehead
down
her
cheek
out
over
her
shoulder
she
was
beautiful
with
the
joy
that
was
hers
at
last
hugh
stepped
in
and
stood
to
push
the
boat
out
from
the
shore
his
eyes
never
left
hers
it
was
a
deep
long
look
of
which
her
soul
drank
quenching
its
thirst
very
slowly
the
boat
moved
then
it
turned
a
hand
seemed
to
grip
it
s
prow
there
was
a
mighty
confused
roaring
in
their
ears
the
bank
seemed
to
be
snatched
back
from
them
the
sunlight
shone
into
hugh
s
face
suddenly
he
caught
at
his
oar
the
river
is
not
so
high
he
shouted
the
flood
s
going
he
looked
away
from
her
and
back
we
have
just
a
chance
we
ll
leave
it
to
the
river
it
may
be
the
end
of
you
and
me
or
bella
it
may
be
the
he
steadied
the
boat
with
all
his
skill
it
was
drawn
with
frightful
swiftness
down
the
swollen
stream
before
noon
sylvie
and
pete
moved
slowly
across
the
open
space
and
went
back
along
their
forest
trail
they
walked
like
lovers
and
sylvie
s
arm
helped
to
support
him
just
before
he
stepped
in
among
the
trees
he
turned
for
a
long
desolate
backward
look
now
the
hoop
of
green
once
white
as
paper
under
the
noon
sun
and
the
level
circular
rim
of
the
forest
are
empty
and
silent
except
for
the
rattling
of
the
river
and
the
moving
of
the
pines
against
the
fixed
grave
stars
the
human
tragedy
or
was
it
comedy
has
burnt
itself
out
like
the
embers
of
a
that
will
never
again
be
kindled
in
that
lonely
spot
the
end
