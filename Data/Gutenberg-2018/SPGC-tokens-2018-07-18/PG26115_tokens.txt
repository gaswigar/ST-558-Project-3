a
small
boy
and
others
i
in
the
attempt
to
place
together
some
particulars
of
the
early
life
of
william
james
and
present
him
in
his
setting
his
immediate
native
and
domestic
air
so
that
any
future
gathered
memorials
of
him
might
become
the
more
intelligible
and
interesting
i
found
one
of
the
consequences
of
my
interrogation
of
the
past
assert
itself
a
good
deal
at
the
expense
of
some
of
the
others
for
it
was
to
memory
in
the
first
place
that
my
main
appeal
for
particulars
had
to
be
made
i
had
been
too
near
a
witness
of
my
brother
beginnings
of
life
and
too
close
a
participant
by
affection
admiration
and
sympathy
in
whatever
touched
and
moved
him
not
to
feel
myself
in
possession
even
of
a
greater
quantity
of
significant
truth
a
larger
handful
of
the
fine
substance
of
history
than
i
could
hope
to
express
or
apply
to
recover
anything
like
the
full
treasure
of
scattered
wasted
circumstance
was
at
the
same
time
to
live
over
the
spent
experience
itself
so
deep
and
rich
and
rare
with
whatever
sadder
and
sorer
intensities
even
with
whatever
poorer
and
thinner
passages
after
the
manner
of
every
one
experience
and
the
effect
of
this
in
turn
was
to
find
discrimination
among
the
parts
of
my
subject
again
and
again
difficult
so
inseparably
and
beautifully
they
seemed
to
hang
together
and
the
comprehensive
case
to
decline
mutilation
or
refuse
to
be
treated
otherwise
than
handsomely
this
meant
that
aspects
began
to
multiply
and
images
to
swarm
so
far
at
least
as
they
showed
to
appreciation
as
true
terms
and
happy
values
and
that
i
might
positively
and
exceedingly
rejoice
in
my
relation
to
most
of
them
using
it
for
all
that
as
the
phrase
is
it
should
be
worth
to
knock
at
the
door
of
the
past
was
in
a
word
to
see
it
open
to
me
quite
wide
to
see
the
world
within
begin
to
compose
with
a
grace
of
its
own
round
the
primary
figure
see
it
people
itself
vividly
and
insistently
such
then
is
the
circle
of
my
commemoration
and
so
much
these
free
and
copious
notes
a
labour
of
love
and
loyalty
we
were
to
my
sense
the
blest
group
of
us
such
a
company
of
characters
and
such
a
picture
of
differences
and
withal
so
fused
and
united
and
interlocked
that
each
of
us
to
that
fond
fancy
pleads
for
preservation
and
that
in
respect
to
what
i
speak
of
myself
as
possessing
i
think
i
shall
be
ashamed
as
of
a
cold
impiety
to
find
any
element
altogether
negligible
to
which
i
may
add
perhaps
that
i
struggle
under
the
drawback
innate
and
inbred
of
seeing
the
whole
content
of
memory
and
affection
in
each
enacted
and
recovered
moment
as
who
should
say
in
the
vivid
image
and
the
very
scene
the
light
of
the
only
terms
in
which
life
has
treated
me
to
experience
and
i
cherish
the
moment
and
evoke
the
image
and
repaint
the
scene
though
meanwhile
indeed
scarce
able
to
convey
how
prevailingly
and
almost
exclusively
during
years
and
years
the
field
was
animated
and
the
adventure
conditioned
for
me
by
my
brother
nearness
and
that
play
of
genius
in
him
of
which
i
had
never
had
a
doubt
from
the
first
the
first
then
since
i
retrace
our
steps
to
the
start
for
the
pleasure
strangely
mixed
though
it
be
of
feeling
our
small
feet
plant
themselves
afresh
and
artlessly
stumble
forward
again
the
first
began
long
ago
far
off
and
yet
glimmers
at
me
there
as
out
of
a
thin
golden
haze
with
all
the
charm
for
imagination
and
memory
of
pressing
pursuit
rewarded
of
distinctness
in
the
dimness
of
the
flush
of
life
in
the
grey
of
the
wonder
of
consciousness
in
everything
everything
having
naturally
been
all
the
while
but
the
abject
little
matter
of
course
partly
doubtless
as
the
effect
of
a
life
now
getting
to
be
a
tolerably
long
one
spent
in
the
older
world
i
see
the
world
of
our
childhood
as
very
young
indeed
young
with
its
own
juvenility
as
well
as
with
ours
as
if
it
wore
the
few
and
light
garments
and
had
gathered
in
but
the
scant
properties
and
breakable
toys
of
the
tenderest
age
or
were
at
the
most
a
very
unformed
young
person
even
a
boisterous
hobbledehoy
it
exhaled
at
any
rate
a
simple
freshness
and
i
catch
its
pure
breath
at
our
infantile
albany
as
the
very
air
of
long
summer
afternoons
occasions
tasting
of
ample
leisure
still
bookless
yet
beginning
to
be
bedless
or
cribless
tasting
of
accessible
garden
peaches
in
a
liberal
backward
territory
that
was
still
almost
part
of
a
country
town
tasting
of
uncles
aunts
cousins
of
strange
legendary
domestics
inveterately
but
archaically
irish
and
whose
familiar
remarks
and
criticism
of
life
were
handed
down
as
well
as
of
dim
family
ramifications
and
local
allusions
mystifications
always
that
flowered
into
anecdote
as
into
small
hard
plums
tasting
above
all
of
a
big
savoury
house
in
which
a
widowed
grandmother
catherine
barber
by
birth
whose
attitude
was
a
resigned
consciousness
of
complications
and
accretions
dispensed
an
hospitality
seemingly
as
joyless
as
it
was
certainly
boundless
what
she
dear
gentle
lady
of
many
cares
and
anxieties
was
the
fiction
of
the
day
the
novels
at
that
time
promptly
pirated
of
trollope
and
gore
of
marsh
hubback
and
the
misses
kavanagh
and
aguilar
whose
very
names
are
forgotten
now
but
which
used
to
drive
her
away
to
quiet
corners
whence
her
figure
comes
back
to
me
bent
forward
on
a
table
with
the
book
held
out
at
a
distance
and
a
tall
single
candle
placed
apparently
not
at
all
to
her
discomfort
in
that
age
of
sparer
and
braver
habits
straight
between
the
page
and
her
eyes
there
is
a
very
animated
allusion
to
one
or
two
of
her
aspects
in
the
fragment
of
a
spiritual
autobiography
the
reminiscences
of
a
stephen
dewhurst
printed
by
j
in
the
literary
remains
of
henry
james
a
reference
which
has
the
interest
of
being
very
nearly
as
characteristic
of
my
father
himself
which
his
references
in
almost
any
connection
were
wont
to
be
as
of
the
person
or
the
occasion
evoked
i
had
reached
my
sixteenth
year
when
she
died
and
as
my
only
remembered
grandparent
she
touches
the
chord
of
attachment
to
a
particular
vibration
she
represented
for
us
in
our
generation
the
only
english
blood
that
of
both
her
own
parents
flowing
in
our
veins
i
confess
that
out
of
that
association
for
reasons
and
reasons
i
feel
her
image
most
beneficently
bend
we
were
as
to
three
parts
of
two
other
stocks
and
i
recall
how
from
far
back
i
reflected
for
i
see
i
must
have
been
always
reflecting
that
mixed
as
such
a
mixture
our
scotch
with
our
irish
might
be
it
had
had
still
a
grace
to
borrow
from
the
third
infusion
or
dimension
if
i
could
freely
have
chosen
moreover
it
was
precisely
from
my
father
mother
that
fond
votary
of
the
finest
faith
in
the
vivifying
and
characterising
force
of
mothers
i
should
have
wished
to
borrow
it
even
while
conscious
that
catherine
own
people
had
drawn
breath
in
american
air
for
at
least
two
generations
before
her
our
father
father
william
james
an
irishman
and
a
protestant
born
of
county
cavan
had
come
to
america
a
very
young
man
and
then
sole
of
his
family
shortly
after
the
revolutionary
war
my
father
the
second
son
of
the
third
of
the
marriages
to
which
the
country
of
his
adoption
was
liberally
to
help
him
had
been
born
in
albany
in
our
maternal
greatgrandfather
on
the
father
side
hugh
walsh
had
reached
our
shores
from
a
like
irish
home
killyleagh
county
down
somewhat
earlier
in
he
being
then
nineteen
he
had
settled
at
half
way
to
albany
where
some
of
his
descendants
till
lately
lingered
our
maternal
greatgrandfather
on
the
mother
side
that
is
our
mother
mother
father
alexander
robertson
of
polmont
near
edinburgh
had
likewise
crossed
the
sea
in
the
and
prospered
in
new
york
very
much
as
hugh
walsh
was
prospering
and
william
james
was
still
more
markedly
to
prosper
further
up
the
hudson
as
unanimous
and
fortunate
beholders
of
the
course
of
which
admirable
stream
i
like
to
think
of
them
i
find
alexander
robertson
inscribed
in
a
wee
new
york
directory
of
the
close
of
the
century
as
merchant
and
our
childhood
in
that
city
was
passed
as
to
some
of
its
aspects
in
a
sense
of
the
afterglow
reduced
and
circumscribed
it
is
true
but
by
no
means
wholly
inanimate
of
his
shining
solidity
the
sweet
taste
of
albany
probably
lurked
most
in
its
being
our
admired
antithesis
to
new
york
it
was
holiday
whereas
new
york
was
home
at
least
that
presently
came
to
be
the
relation
for
to
my
very
very
first
fleeting
vision
i
apprehend
albany
itself
must
have
been
the
scene
exhibited
our
parents
had
gone
there
for
a
year
or
two
to
be
near
our
grandmother
on
their
return
from
their
first
that
is
our
first
visit
to
europe
which
had
quite
immediately
followed
my
birth
which
appears
to
have
lasted
some
year
and
a
half
and
of
which
i
shall
have
another
word
to
say
the
albany
experiment
would
have
been
then
their
first
founded
housekeeping
since
i
make
them
out
to
have
betaken
themselves
for
the
winter
following
their
marriage
to
the
ancient
astor
house
not
indeed
at
that
time
ancient
but
the
great
and
appointed
modern
hotel
of
new
york
the
only
one
of
such
pretensions
and
which
somehow
continued
to
project
its
massive
image
that
of
a
great
square
block
of
granite
with
vast
dark
warm
interiors
across
some
of
the
later
and
more
sensitive
stages
of
my
infancy
clearly
or
i
should
perhaps
rather
say
dimly
recourse
to
that
hospitality
was
again
occasionally
had
by
our
parents
who
had
originally
had
it
to
such
a
happy
end
that
on
january
my
elder
brother
had
come
into
the
world
there
it
remained
a
tradition
with
him
that
our
father
friend
from
an
early
time
emerson
then
happening
to
be
in
new
york
and
under
that
convenient
roof
was
proudly
and
pressingly
taken
upstairs
to
admire
and
give
his
blessing
to
the
babe
who
was
to
become
the
second
american
william
james
the
blessing
was
to
be
renewed
i
may
mention
in
the
sense
that
among
the
impressions
of
the
next
early
years
i
easily
distinguish
that
of
the
great
and
urbane
emerson
occasional
presence
in
fourteenth
street
a
centre
of
many
images
where
the
parental
tent
was
before
long
to
pitch
itself
and
rest
awhile
i
am
interested
for
the
moment
however
in
identifying
the
scene
of
our
very
first
perceptions
of
my
very
own
at
least
which
i
can
here
best
speak
for
one
of
these
and
probably
the
promptest
in
order
was
that
of
my
brother
occupying
a
place
in
the
world
to
which
i
could
at
all
aspire
to
any
approach
to
which
in
truth
i
seem
to
myself
ever
conscious
of
having
signally
forfeited
a
title
it
glimmers
back
to
me
that
i
quite
definitely
and
resignedly
thought
of
him
as
in
the
most
exemplary
manner
already
beforehand
with
me
already
seated
at
his
task
when
the
attempt
to
drag
me
crying
and
kicking
to
the
first
hour
of
my
education
failed
on
the
threshold
of
the
dutch
house
in
albany
after
the
fashion
i
have
glanced
at
in
a
collection
of
other
pages
than
these
just
as
i
remember
to
have
once
borrowed
a
hint
from
our
interior
in
a
work
of
imagination
that
failure
of
my
powers
or
that
indifference
to
them
my
retreat
shrieking
from
the
dutch
house
was
to
leave
him
once
for
all
already
there
an
embodied
demonstration
of
the
possible
already
wherever
it
might
be
that
there
was
a
question
of
my
arriving
when
arriving
at
all
belatedly
and
ruefully
as
if
he
had
gained
such
an
advance
of
me
in
his
sixteen
months
experience
of
the
world
before
mine
began
that
i
never
for
all
the
time
of
childhood
and
youth
in
the
least
caught
up
with
him
or
overtook
him
he
was
always
round
the
corner
and
out
of
sight
coming
back
into
view
but
at
his
hours
of
extremest
ease
we
were
never
in
the
same
schoolroom
in
the
same
game
scarce
even
in
step
together
or
in
the
same
phase
at
the
same
time
when
our
phases
overlapped
that
is
it
was
only
for
a
moment
he
was
clean
out
before
i
had
got
well
in
how
far
he
had
really
at
any
moment
dashed
forward
it
is
not
for
me
now
to
attempt
to
say
what
comes
to
me
is
that
i
at
least
hung
inveterately
and
woefully
back
and
that
this
relation
alike
to
our
interests
and
to
each
other
seemed
proper
and
preappointed
i
lose
myself
in
wonder
at
the
loose
ways
the
strange
process
of
waste
through
which
nature
and
fortune
may
deal
on
occasion
with
those
whose
faculty
for
application
is
all
and
only
in
their
imagination
and
their
sensibility
there
may
be
during
those
bewildered
and
brooding
years
so
little
for
them
to
show
that
i
liken
the
individual
dunce
as
he
so
often
must
appear
to
some
commercial
traveller
who
has
lost
the
key
to
his
packed
case
of
samples
and
can
but
pass
for
a
fool
while
other
exhibitions
go
forward
i
achieve
withal
a
dim
remembrance
of
my
final
submission
though
it
is
the
faintest
ghost
of
an
impression
and
consists
but
of
the
bright
blur
of
a
dame
schoolroom
a
mere
medium
for
small
piping
shuffling
sound
and
suffered
heat
as
well
as
for
the
wistfulness
produced
by
glimmering
squares
that
were
fitfully
screened
though
not
to
any
revival
of
cheer
by
a
huge
swaying
yet
dominant
object
this
dominant
object
the
shepherdess
of
the
flock
was
miss
bayou
or
bayhoo
i
recover
but
the
alien
sound
of
her
name
which
memory
caresses
only
because
she
may
have
been
of
like
race
with
her
temple
of
learning
which
faced
my
grandmother
house
in
north
pearl
street
and
really
justified
its
exotic
claim
by
its
yellow
archaic
i
think
of
the
same
as
of
brick
baked
in
the
land
of
dykes
and
making
a
series
of
small
steps
from
the
base
of
the
gable
to
the
point
these
images
are
subject
i
confess
to
a
soft
confusion
which
is
somehow
consecrated
none
the
less
and
out
of
which
with
its
shade
of
contributory
truth
some
sort
of
scene
insists
on
glancing
the
very
flush
of
the
uneven
bricks
of
the
pavement
lives
in
it
the
very
smell
of
the
street
cobbles
the
imputed
grace
of
the
arching
umbrage
i
see
it
all
as
from
under
trees
the
form
of
steuben
street
which
crossed
our
view
as
steep
even
to
the
very
essence
of
adventure
with
a
summit
and
still
more
with
a
nethermost
and
riskiest
incline
very
far
away
there
lives
in
it
the
aspect
of
the
other
house
the
other
and
much
smaller
than
my
grandmother
conveniently
near
it
and
within
sight
which
was
picked
out
with
white
whereas
my
grandmother
was
and
very
grave
and
which
must
have
stood
back
a
little
from
the
street
as
i
seem
even
now
to
swing
or
at
least
to
perch
on
a
relaxed
gate
of
approach
that
was
conceived
to
work
by
an
iron
chain
weighted
with
a
big
ball
all
under
a
spreading
tree
again
and
with
the
high
oh
so
high
white
stone
steps
must
they
have
been
marble
and
door
of
the
front
behind
me
i
lose
myself
in
ravishment
before
the
marble
and
the
pink
there
were
other
houses
too
one
of
them
the
occasion
of
the
first
paid
visit
that
struggles
with
my
twilight
of
social
consciousness
a
call
with
my
father
conveying
me
presumably
for
fond
exhibition
since
if
my
powers
were
not
exhibitional
my
appearance
and
my
long
fair
curls
of
which
i
distinctly
remember
the
lachrymose
sacrifice
suppositiously
were
on
one
of
our
aunts
the
youngest
of
his
three
sisters
lately
married
and
who
predestined
to
an
early
death
hovers
there
for
me
softly
spectral
in
long
light
front
ringlets
the
fashion
of
the
time
and
the
capital
sign
of
all
our
paternal
aunts
seemingly
with
the
remembered
enhancement
of
her
living
in
elk
street
the
name
itself
vaguely
portentous
as
through
beasts
of
the
forest
not
yet
wholly
exorcised
and
more
or
less
under
the
high
brow
of
that
capitol
which
as
aloft
somewhere
and
beneath
the
thickest
shades
of
all
loomed
familiar
yet
impressive
at
the
end
of
almost
any
albany
vista
of
reference
i
have
seen
other
capitols
since
but
the
whole
majesty
of
the
matter
must
have
been
then
distilled
into
my
mind
even
though
the
connection
was
indirect
and
the
concrete
image
that
of
the
primitive
structure
long
since
pretentiously
and
insecurely
superseded
so
that
later
on
the
impression
was
to
find
itself
as
the
phrase
is
discounted
had
it
not
moreover
been
reinforced
at
the
time
for
that
particular
capitoline
hour
by
the
fact
that
our
uncle
our
aunt
husband
was
a
son
of
martin
van
buren
and
that
was
the
president
this
at
least
led
the
imagination
on
or
leads
in
any
case
my
present
imagination
of
that
one
ministering
to
what
i
have
called
the
soft
confusion
the
confusion
clears
however
though
the
softness
remains
when
ceasing
to
press
too
far
backward
i
meet
the
ampler
light
of
conscious
and
educated
little
returns
to
the
place
for
the
education
of
new
york
enjoyed
up
to
my
twelfth
year
failed
to
blight
its
romantic
appeal
the
images
i
really
distinguish
flush
through
the
maturer
medium
but
with
the
sense
of
them
only
the
more
wondrous
the
other
house
the
house
of
my
parents
limited
early
sojourn
becomes
that
of
those
of
our
cousins
numerous
at
that
time
who
figured
for
us
the
various
brood
presided
over
by
my
father
second
sister
catherine
james
who
had
married
at
a
very
early
age
captain
robert
temple
both
these
parents
were
to
die
young
and
their
children
six
in
number
the
two
eldest
boys
were
very
markedly
to
people
our
preliminary
scene
this
being
true
in
particular
of
three
of
them
the
sharply
differing
brothers
and
the
second
sister
mary
temple
radiant
and
rare
extinguished
in
her
first
youth
but
after
having
made
an
impression
on
many
persons
and
on
ourselves
not
least
which
was
to
become
in
the
harmonious
circle
for
all
time
matter
of
sacred
legend
and
reference
of
associated
piety
those
and
others
with
them
were
the
numerous
dawnings
on
which
in
many
cases
the
deepening
and
final
darknesses
were
so
soon
to
follow
our
father
family
was
to
offer
such
a
chronicle
of
early
deaths
arrested
careers
broken
promises
orphaned
children
it
sounds
but
part
of
the
charm
of
our
grandmother
house
for
us
or
i
should
perhaps
but
speak
for
myself
was
in
its
being
so
much
and
so
sociably
a
nurseried
and
playroomed
orphanage
the
children
of
her
lost
daughters
and
overflowed
there
mainly
as
girls
on
whom
the
surviving
and
sons
occasionally
and
most
trustingly
looked
in
parentally
bereft
cousins
were
somehow
more
thrilling
than
parentally
provided
ones
and
most
thrilling
when
in
the
odd
fashion
of
that
time
they
were
sent
to
school
in
new
york
as
a
preliminary
to
their
being
sent
to
school
in
europe
they
spent
scraps
of
holidays
with
us
in
fourteenth
street
and
i
think
my
first
childish
conception
of
the
enviable
lot
formed
amid
these
associations
was
to
be
so
little
fathered
or
mothered
so
little
sunk
in
the
short
range
that
the
romance
of
life
seemed
to
lie
in
some
constant
improvisation
by
vague
overhovering
authorities
of
new
situations
and
horizons
we
were
intensely
domesticated
yet
for
the
very
reason
perhaps
that
we
felt
our
young
bonds
easy
and
they
were
so
easy
compared
to
other
small
plights
of
which
we
had
stray
glimpses
that
my
first
assured
conception
of
true
richness
was
that
we
should
be
sent
separately
off
among
cold
or
even
cruel
aliens
in
order
to
be
there
thrillingly
homesick
homesickness
was
a
luxury
i
remember
craving
from
the
tenderest
age
a
luxury
of
which
i
was
unnaturally
or
at
least
prosaically
deprived
our
motherless
cousin
augustus
barker
came
up
from
albany
to
the
institution
charlier
unless
it
was
as
i
suspect
a
still
earlier
specimen
with
a
name
that
fades
from
me
of
that
type
of
french
establishment
for
boys
which
then
and
for
years
after
so
incongruously
flourished
in
new
york
and
though
he
professed
a
complete
satisfaction
with
pleasures
tasted
in
our
innocent
society
i
felt
that
he
was
engaged
in
a
brave
and
strenuous
adventure
while
we
but
hugged
the
comparatively
safe
shore
ii
we
were
william
and
i
at
dispensaries
of
learning
the
number
and
succession
of
which
excite
my
wonder
we
could
have
changed
oftener
it
strikes
me
as
i
look
back
if
our
presence
had
been
inveterately
objected
to
and
yet
i
enjoy
an
inward
certainty
that
my
brother
being
vividly
bright
and
i
quite
blankly
innocuous
this
reproach
was
never
brought
home
to
our
house
it
was
an
humiliation
to
me
at
first
small
boys
though
we
were
that
our
instructors
kept
being
instructresses
and
thereby
a
grave
reflection
both
on
our
attainments
and
our
spirit
a
bevy
of
these
educative
ladies
passes
before
me
i
still
possess
their
names
as
for
instance
that
of
daly
and
that
of
miss
rogers
previously
of
the
chelsea
female
institute
though
at
the
moment
of
sixth
avenue
this
latter
whose
benches
indeed
my
brother
did
haunt
but
who
handled
us
literally
with
gloves
i
still
see
the
elegant
objects
as
miss
rogers
beat
time
with
a
long
black
ferule
to
some
species
of
droning
chant
or
chorus
in
which
we
spent
most
of
our
hours
just
as
i
see
her
very
tall
and
straight
and
spare
in
a
light
blue
dress
her
firm
face
framed
in
long
black
glossy
ringlets
and
the
stamp
of
the
chelsea
female
institute
all
over
her
daly
clearly
the
immediate
successor
to
the
nebulous
miss
bayou
remains
quite
substantial
perhaps
because
the
sphere
of
her
small
influence
has
succeeded
in
not
passing
away
up
to
this
present
writing
so
that
in
certain
notes
on
new
york
published
a
few
years
since
i
was
moved
to
refer
to
it
with
emotion
as
one
of
the
small
red
houses
on
the
south
side
of
waverley
place
that
really
carry
the
imagination
back
to
a
vanished
social
order
they
carry
mine
to
a
stout
lady
with
grey
hair
and
a
large
apron
the
latter
convenience
somehow
suggesting
as
she
stood
about
with
a
resolute
air
that
she
viewed
her
little
pupils
as
so
many
small
slices
cut
from
the
loaf
of
life
and
on
which
she
was
to
dab
the
butter
of
arithmetic
and
spelling
accompanied
by
way
of
jam
with
a
light
application
of
the
practice
of
i
recall
an
occasion
indeed
i
must
in
justice
mention
when
the
jam
really
was
thick
my
only
memory
of
a
schoolfeast
strange
to
say
throughout
our
young
annals
something
uncanny
in
the
air
of
the
schoolroom
at
the
unwonted
evening
or
late
afternoon
hour
and
tables
that
seemed
to
me
prodigiously
long
and
on
which
the
edibles
were
chunky
and
sticky
the
stout
lady
must
have
been
irish
as
the
name
she
bore
imported
or
do
i
think
so
but
from
the
indescribably
irish
look
of
her
revisited
house
it
refers
itself
at
any
rate
to
a
new
york
age
in
which
a
little
more
or
a
little
less
of
the
colour
was
scarce
notable
in
the
general
flush
of
pure
unimported
strain
however
were
miss
sedgwick
and
wright
lavinia
the
next
figures
in
the
procession
the
procession
that
was
to
wind
up
indeed
with
two
foreign
recruits
small
brown
snappy
mademoiselle
delavigne
who
plied
us
with
the
french
tongue
at
home
and
who
had
been
introduced
to
us
as
the
niece
or
could
it
have
been
the
grandniece
of
the
celebrated
casimir
and
a
large
russian
lady
in
an
extraordinarily
short
cape
i
like
to
recall
the
fashion
of
short
capes
of
the
same
stuff
as
her
dress
and
merovingian
sidebraids
that
seemed
to
require
the
royal
crown
of
frédégonde
or
brunéhaut
to
complete
their
effect
this
final
and
aggravational
representative
of
the
compromising
sex
looms
to
my
mind
eye
i
should
add
but
as
the
creature
of
an
hour
in
spite
of
her
having
been
domiciled
with
us
whereas
i
think
of
mademoiselle
delavigne
as
flitting
in
and
out
on
quick
fine
more
or
less
feet
of
exemplary
neatness
the
feet
of
louis
philippe
and
of
the
female
figures
in
those
volumes
of
gavarni
then
actual
then
contemporaneous
which
were
kept
in
a
piece
of
furniture
that
stood
between
the
windows
in
fourteenth
street
together
with
a
set
of
béranger
enriched
by
steel
engravings
to
the
strange
imagery
of
which
i
so
wonderingly
responded
that
all
other
art
of
illustration
ever
since
has
been
for
me
comparatively
weak
and
cold
these
volumes
and
the
tall
entrancing
folios
of
lithographed
mansions
of
england
in
the
olden
time
formed
a
store
lending
itself
particularly
to
distribution
on
the
drawingroom
carpet
with
concomitant
pressure
to
the
same
surface
of
the
small
stomach
and
relieving
agitation
of
his
backward
heels
i
make
out
that
it
had
decidedly
been
given
to
mlle
delavigne
to
represent
to
my
first
perception
personal
france
she
was
besides
not
being
at
all
pink
or
shy
oval
and
fluent
and
mistress
somehow
of
the
step
the
step
of
levity
that
involved
a
whisk
of
her
short
skirts
there
she
was
to
the
life
on
the
page
of
gavarni
attesting
its
reality
and
there
again
did
that
page
in
return
i
speak
not
of
course
of
the
unplumbed
depths
of
the
appended
text
attest
her
own
felicity
i
was
later
on
to
feel
that
is
i
was
to
learn
how
many
impressions
and
appearances
how
large
a
sense
of
things
her
type
and
tone
prefigured
the
evanescence
of
the
large
russian
lady
whom
i
think
of
as
rather
rank
i
ca
express
it
otherwise
may
have
been
owing
to
some
question
of
the
purity
of
her
accent
in
french
it
was
one
of
her
attributes
and
her
grounds
of
appeal
to
us
that
she
had
come
straight
from
siberia
and
it
is
distinct
to
me
that
the
purity
was
challenged
by
a
friend
of
the
house
and
without
pathetically
enough
provoking
the
only
answer
the
plea
that
the
missing
atticism
would
have
been
wasted
on
young
barbarians
the
siberian
note
on
our
inmate
part
may
perhaps
have
been
the
least
of
her
incongruities
she
was
above
all
too
big
for
a
little
job
towered
over
us
doubtless
too
heroically
and
her
proportions
hover
but
to
lose
themselves
with
the
successors
to
her
function
awaiting
us
a
little
longer
meanwhile
to
revert
an
instant
if
the
depressed
consciousness
of
our
still
more
or
less
quailing
educationally
beneath
the
female
eye
and
there
was
as
well
the
deeper
depth
there
was
the
degrading
fact
that
with
us
literally
consorted
and
contended
girls
that
we
sat
and
strove
even
though
we
drew
the
line
at
playing
with
them
and
at
knowing
them
when
not
of
the
swarming
cousinship
at
home
if
that
felt
awkwardness
did
exactly
coincide
with
the
ironic
effect
of
gussy
appearances
his
emergence
from
rich
mystery
and
his
return
to
it
our
state
was
but
comparatively
the
braver
he
always
had
so
much
more
to
tell
us
than
we
could
possibly
have
to
tell
him
on
reflection
i
see
that
the
most
completely
rueful
period
could
after
all
greatly
have
prolonged
itself
since
the
female
eye
last
bent
on
us
would
have
been
that
of
lavinia
wright
to
our
connection
with
whom
a
small
odd
reminiscence
attaches
a
date
a
little
schoolmate
displayed
to
me
with
pride
while
the
connection
lasted
a
beautiful
coloured
a
positively
iridescent
and
gilded
card
representing
the
first
of
all
the
great
exhibitions
of
our
age
the
london
crystal
palace
of
his
father
having
lately
gone
out
to
it
and
sent
him
the
dazzling
memento
in
i
was
eight
years
old
and
my
brother
scarce
more
than
nine
in
addition
to
which
it
is
distinct
to
me
in
the
first
place
that
we
were
never
faithful
long
or
for
more
than
one
winter
to
the
same
studious
scene
and
in
the
second
that
among
our
instructors
lavinia
had
no
successor
of
her
own
sex
unless
i
count
vredenburg
of
new
brighton
where
we
spent
the
summer
of
when
i
had
reached
the
age
of
eleven
and
found
myself
bewildered
by
recognition
of
the
part
that
attendance
at
school
was
so
meanly
to
play
in
the
hitherto
unclouded
long
vacation
this
was
true
at
least
for
myself
and
my
next
younger
brother
wilky
who
under
the
presumption
now
dawning
of
his
community
of
pursuits
with
my
own
was
from
that
moment
off
and
on
for
a
few
years
my
extremely
easy
yokefellow
and
playfellow
on
william
charged
with
learning
i
thought
of
him
inveterately
from
our
younger
time
as
charged
with
learning
no
such
trick
was
played
he
rested
or
roamed
that
summer
on
his
accumulations
a
fact
which
as
i
was
sure
i
saw
these
more
and
more
richly
accumulate
did
in
the
least
make
me
wonder
it
comes
back
to
me
in
truth
that
i
had
been
prepared
for
anything
by
his
having
said
to
me
toward
the
end
of
our
time
at
lavinia
d
and
with
characteristic
authority
his
enjoyment
of
it
coming
from
my
character
i
mean
quite
as
much
as
from
his
own
that
that
lady
was
a
very
able
woman
as
shown
by
the
experiments
upstairs
he
was
upstairs
of
course
and
i
was
down
and
i
scarce
even
knew
what
experiments
were
beyond
their
indeed
requiring
capability
the
region
of
their
performance
was
natural
sphere
though
i
recall
that
i
had
a
sense
of
peeping
into
it
to
a
thrilled
effect
on
seeing
our
instructress
illustrate
the
proper
way
to
extinguish
a
candle
she
firmly
pressed
the
flame
between
her
thumb
and
her
two
forefingers
and
on
my
remarking
that
i
did
see
how
she
could
do
it
promptly
replied
that
i
of
course
could
do
it
myself
as
could
because
i
should
be
afraid
that
reflection
on
my
courage
awakes
another
echo
of
the
same
scant
season
since
the
test
involved
must
have
been
that
of
our
taking
our
way
home
through
fourth
avenue
from
some
point
up
town
and
wright
situation
in
east
street
was
such
a
point
the
hudson
river
railroad
was
then
in
course
of
construction
or
was
being
made
to
traverse
the
upper
reaches
of
the
city
through
that
part
of
which
raged
to
my
young
sense
a
riot
of
explosion
and
a
great
shouting
and
waving
of
red
flags
when
the
gunpowder
introduced
into
the
rocky
soil
was
about
to
take
effect
it
was
our
theory
that
our
passage
there
in
the
early
afternoon
was
beset
with
danger
and
our
impression
that
we
saw
fragments
of
rock
hurtle
through
the
air
and
smite
to
the
earth
another
and
yet
another
of
the
persons
engaged
or
exposed
the
point
of
honour
among
several
of
us
was
of
course
nobly
to
defy
the
danger
and
i
feel
again
the
emotion
with
which
i
both
hoped
and
feared
that
the
red
flags
lurid
signals
descried
from
afar
would
enable
or
compel
us
to
renew
the
feat
that
i
did
for
myself
inveterately
renew
it
i
seem
to
infer
from
the
memory
of
other
perambulations
of
the
period
as
to
which
i
am
divided
between
their
still
present
freshness
and
my
sense
of
perhaps
making
too
much
of
these
tiny
particles
of
history
my
stronger
rule
however
i
confess
and
the
one
by
which
i
must
here
consistently
be
guided
is
that
from
the
moment
it
is
a
question
of
projecting
a
picture
no
particle
that
counts
for
memory
or
is
appreciable
to
the
spirit
be
too
tiny
and
that
experience
in
the
name
of
which
one
speaks
is
all
compact
of
them
and
shining
with
them
there
was
at
any
rate
another
way
home
with
other
appeals
which
consisted
of
getting
straight
along
westward
to
broadway
a
sphere
of
a
different
order
of
fascination
and
bristling
as
i
seem
to
recall
with
more
vivid
aspects
greater
curiosities
and
wonderments
curiosity
was
of
course
the
as
i
supposed
it
to
be
on
the
northeast
corner
of
eighteenth
street
if
i
am
not
mistaken
a
big
brown
house
in
grounds
peopled
with
animal
life
which
little
as
its
site
may
appear
to
know
it
lingered
on
into
considerably
later
years
i
have
but
to
close
my
eyes
in
order
to
open
them
inwardly
again
while
i
lean
against
the
tall
brown
iron
rails
and
peer
through
to
a
romantic
view
of
browsing
and
pecking
and
parading
creatures
not
numerous
but
all
of
distinguished
appearance
two
or
three
elegant
little
cows
of
refined
form
and
colour
two
or
three
nibbling
fawns
and
a
larger
company
above
all
of
peacocks
and
guineafowl
with
doubtless
though
as
to
this
i
am
vague
some
of
the
commoner
ornaments
of
the
barnyard
i
recognise
that
the
scene
as
i
evoke
it
fails
of
grandeur
but
it
none
the
less
had
for
me
the
note
of
greatness
all
of
which
but
shows
of
course
what
a
very
small
person
i
was
and
was
to
remain
i
see
myself
moreover
as
somehow
always
alone
in
these
and
like
new
york
and
contemplations
and
feel
how
the
sense
of
my
being
so
being
at
any
rate
master
of
my
short
steps
such
as
they
were
through
all
the
beguiling
streets
was
probably
the
very
savour
of
each
of
my
chance
feasts
which
stirs
in
me
at
the
same
time
some
wonder
at
the
liberty
of
range
and
opportunity
of
adventure
allowed
to
my
tender
age
though
the
puzzle
may
very
well
drop
after
all
as
i
ruefully
reflect
that
i
could
have
been
judged
at
home
reckless
or
adventurous
what
i
look
back
to
as
my
infant
license
can
only
have
had
for
its
ground
some
timely
conviction
on
the
part
of
my
elders
that
the
only
form
of
riot
or
revel
ever
known
to
me
would
be
that
of
the
visiting
mind
was
i
myself
for
that
matter
even
at
that
time
all
acutely
and
yet
resignedly
even
quite
fatalistically
aware
of
what
to
think
of
this
i
at
any
rate
watch
the
small
boy
dawdle
and
gape
again
i
smell
the
cold
dusty
paint
and
iron
as
the
rails
of
the
eighteenth
street
corner
rub
his
contemplative
nose
and
feeling
him
foredoomed
withhold
from
him
no
grain
of
my
sympathy
he
is
a
convenient
little
image
or
warning
of
all
that
was
to
be
for
him
and
he
might
well
have
been
even
happier
than
he
was
for
there
was
the
very
pattern
and
measure
of
all
he
was
to
demand
just
to
somewhere
almost
anywhere
would
do
and
somehow
receive
an
impression
or
an
accession
feel
a
relation
or
a
vibration
he
was
to
go
without
many
things
ever
so
many
as
all
persons
do
in
whom
contemplation
takes
so
much
the
place
of
action
but
everywhere
in
the
years
that
came
soon
after
and
that
in
fact
continued
long
in
the
streets
of
great
towns
in
new
york
still
for
some
time
and
then
for
a
while
in
london
in
paris
in
geneva
wherever
it
might
be
he
was
to
enjoy
more
than
anything
the
so
far
from
showy
practice
of
wondering
and
dawdling
and
gaping
he
was
really
i
think
much
to
profit
by
it
what
it
at
all
appreciably
gave
him
that
is
gave
him
in
producible
form
would
be
difficult
to
state
but
it
seems
to
him
as
he
even
now
thus
indulges
himself
an
education
like
another
feeling
as
he
has
come
to
do
more
and
more
that
no
education
avails
for
the
intelligence
that
does
stir
in
it
some
subjective
passion
and
that
on
the
other
hand
almost
anything
that
does
so
act
is
largely
educative
however
small
a
figure
the
process
might
make
in
a
scheme
of
training
strange
indeed
furthermore
are
some
of
the
things
that
stirred
a
subjective
passion
stirred
it
i
mean
in
young
persons
predisposed
to
a
more
or
less
fine
inspired
application
iii
but
i
positively
dawdle
and
gape
here
i
catch
myself
in
the
act
so
that
i
take
up
the
thread
of
fond
reflection
that
guides
me
through
that
mystification
of
the
summer
school
which
i
referred
to
a
little
way
back
at
the
time
when
the
summer
school
as
known
in
america
was
so
deep
in
the
bosom
of
the
future
the
seat
of
acquisition
i
speak
of
must
have
been
contiguous
to
the
house
we
occupied
i
recall
it
as
most
intimately
and
objectionably
near
and
carried
on
in
the
interest
of
those
parents
from
new
york
who
in
villeggiatura
under
the
queer
conditions
of
those
days
with
the
many
modern
mitigations
of
the
gregarious
lot
still
unrevealed
and
the
many
refinements
on
the
individual
one
still
undeveloped
welcomed
almost
any
influence
that
might
help
at
all
to
form
their
children
to
civility
yet
i
remember
that
particular
influence
as
more
noisy
and
drowsy
and
dusty
than
anything
else
as
to
which
it
must
have
partaken
strongly
of
the
general
nature
of
new
brighton
a
neighbourhood
that
no
apt
agency
whatever
had
up
to
that
time
concerned
itself
to
fashion
and
that
was
indeed
to
remain
shabbily
shapeless
for
years
since
i
recall
almost
as
dire
an
impression
of
it
received
in
the
summer
of
i
seem
more
or
less
to
have
begun
life
for
that
matter
with
impressions
of
new
brighton
there
comes
back
to
me
another
considerably
more
infantile
than
that
of
so
infantile
indeed
that
i
wonder
at
its
having
stuck
that
of
a
place
called
the
pavilion
which
must
have
been
an
hotel
sheltering
us
for
july
and
august
and
the
form
of
which
to
childish
retrospect
unprejudiced
by
later
experience
was
that
of
a
great
greek
temple
shining
over
blue
waters
in
the
splendour
of
a
white
colonnade
and
a
great
yellow
pediment
the
elegant
image
remained
though
imprinted
in
a
child
so
small
as
to
be
easily
portable
by
a
stout
nurse
i
remember
and
not
less
easily
duckable
i
gasp
again
and
was
long
to
gasp
with
the
sense
of
salt
immersion
received
at
her
strong
hands
wonderful
altogether
in
fact
i
find
as
i
write
the
quantity
the
intensity
of
picture
recoverable
from
even
the
blankest
and
tenderest
state
of
the
little
canvas
i
connect
somehow
with
the
pavilion
period
a
visit
paid
with
my
father
who
decidedly
must
have
liked
to
take
me
about
i
feel
so
rich
in
that
general
reminiscence
to
a
family
whom
we
reached
in
what
struck
me
as
a
quite
lovely
embowered
place
on
a
very
hot
day
and
among
whom
luxuries
and
eccentricities
flourished
together
they
were
numerous
the
members
of
this
family
they
were
beautiful
they
partook
of
their
meals
or
were
at
the
moment
partaking
of
one
out
of
doors
and
the
then
figure
in
the
group
was
a
very
big
newfoundland
dog
on
whose
back
i
was
put
to
ride
that
must
have
been
my
first
vision
of
the
liberal
life
though
i
further
ask
myself
what
my
age
could
possibly
have
been
when
my
weight
was
so
fantastically
far
from
hinting
at
later
developments
but
the
romance
of
the
hour
was
particularly
in
what
i
have
called
the
eccentric
note
the
fact
that
the
children
my
entertainers
riveted
my
gaze
to
stockingless
and
shoeless
legs
and
feet
conveying
somehow
at
the
same
time
that
they
were
not
poor
and
destitute
but
rich
and
provided
just
as
i
took
their
for
a
sign
of
overflowing
food
and
that
their
state
as
of
children
of
nature
was
a
refinement
of
freedom
and
grace
they
were
to
become
great
and
beautiful
the
household
of
that
glimmering
vision
they
were
to
figure
historically
heroically
and
serve
great
public
ends
but
always
to
my
remembering
eyes
and
fond
fancy
they
were
to
move
through
life
as
with
the
bare
white
feet
of
that
original
preferred
fairness
and
wildness
this
is
rank
embroidery
but
the
old
surface
itself
insists
on
spreading
it
waits
at
least
with
an
air
of
its
own
the
rest
is
silence
i
can
extraordinary
encumbrance
even
for
the
most
doating
of
parents
on
a
morning
call
but
have
returned
with
my
father
to
our
hotel
since
i
feel
that
i
must
not
only
to
this
but
to
a
still
further
extent
face
the
historic
truth
that
we
were
for
considerable
periods
during
our
earliest
time
nothing
less
than
hotel
children
between
the
and
the
later
phases
at
new
brighton
stretched
a
series
of
summers
that
had
seen
us
all
regularly
installed
for
a
couple
of
months
at
an
establishment
passing
in
the
view
of
that
simpler
age
for
a
vast
caravansery
the
hamilton
house
on
the
south
long
island
shore
so
called
from
its
nearness
to
the
fort
of
that
name
which
had
fort
lafayette
the
bastille
of
the
civil
war
out
in
the
channel
before
it
and
which
probably
cast
a
stronger
spell
upon
the
spirit
of
our
childhood
william
and
mine
at
least
than
any
scene
presented
to
us
up
to
our
reaching
our
teens
i
find
that
i
draw
from
the
singularly
unobliterated
memory
of
the
particulars
of
all
that
experience
the
power
quite
to
glory
in
our
shame
of
so
entrancing
an
interest
did
i
feel
it
at
the
time
to
an
hotel
child
and
so
little
would
i
have
exchanged
my
lot
with
that
of
any
small
person
more
privately
bred
we
were
private
enough
in
all
conscience
i
think
i
must
have
felt
the
rest
of
the
year
and
at
what
age
must
i
quite
have
succumbed
to
the
charm
of
the
world
seen
in
a
larger
way
for
there
incomparably
was
the
chance
to
dawdle
and
gape
there
were
human
appearances
in
endless
variety
and
on
the
of
a
piazza
that
my
gape
measured
almost
as
by
miles
it
was
even
as
if
i
had
become
positively
conscious
that
the
social
scene
so
peopled
would
pretty
well
always
say
more
to
me
than
anything
else
what
it
did
say
i
of
course
but
scantly
understood
but
i
none
the
less
knew
it
spoke
and
i
listened
to
its
voice
i
seem
to
recall
very
much
as
young
edwin
in
beattie
poem
listened
to
the
roar
of
tempests
and
torrents
from
the
nobler
eminence
of
beetling
crags
and
in
exposure
to
still
deeper
abysses
i
cling
for
the
moment
however
to
the
small
story
of
our
vredenburg
summer
as
we
were
for
long
afterwards
invidiously
to
brand
it
the
more
that
it
so
plays
its
part
in
illustration
under
the
light
of
a
later
and
happier
age
of
the
growth
when
not
rather
of
the
arrest
of
manners
and
customs
roundabout
our
birthplace
i
think
we
had
never
been
so
much
as
during
these
particular
months
disinherited
of
the
general
and
public
amenities
that
reinforce
for
the
young
private
precept
and
example
disinherited
in
favour
of
dust
and
glare
and
mosquitoes
and
pigs
and
shanties
and
rumshops
of
no
walks
and
scarce
more
drives
of
a
repeated
no
less
than
of
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
more
sordid
sides
of
the
irish
aspect
in
things
there
was
a
castellated
residence
on
the
hill
above
us
very
high
i
remember
supposing
the
hill
and
very
stately
the
structure
it
had
towers
and
views
and
pretensions
and
belonged
to
a
colonel
whom
we
thought
very
handsome
and
very
costumed
as
if
befrogged
and
which
he
could
have
been
at
all
only
to
have
been
would
even
certainly
have
been
at
a
higher
pitch
of
social
effect
and
whose
son
and
heir
also
very
handsome
and
known
familiarly
and
endearingly
as
chick
had
a
velvet
coat
and
a
pony
and
i
think
spurs
all
luxuries
we
were
without
and
was
cousin
to
boys
the
de
coppets
whom
we
had
come
to
know
at
our
school
of
the
previous
winter
and
who
somehow
doubtless
partly
as
guests
of
the
opulent
chick
hovered
again
about
the
field
of
idleness
the
de
coppets
particularly
in
the
person
of
the
louis
had
been
a
value
to
us
or
at
any
rate
to
me
for
though
i
was
in
common
with
my
elders
then
unacquainted
with
the
application
of
that
word
as
i
use
it
here
what
was
my
incipient
sense
of
persons
and
things
what
were
my
first
stirred
observant
and
imaginative
reactions
discriminations
and
categories
but
a
vague
groping
for
it
the
de
coppets
again
as
more
especially
and
most
impressively
interpreted
by
the
subtle
louis
enjoyed
the
of
being
european
they
had
dropped
during
the
scholastic
term
of
straight
from
the
lake
of
geneva
into
the
very
bosom
of
richard
pulling
jenks
select
resort
for
young
gentlemen
then
situated
in
broadway
below
fourth
street
and
had
lately
been
present
at
an
historic
pageant
whether
or
no
celebrating
the
annals
of
the
town
of
coppet
i
know
not
in
which
representatives
of
their
family
had
figured
in
armour
and
on
horseback
as
the
barons
to
our
comprehension
de
coup
or
cou
their
father
was
thus
of
the
canton
de
vaud
only
their
mother
had
been
native
among
ourselves
and
sister
to
the
colonel
of
the
castellations
but
what
was
the
most
vivid
mark
of
the
brothers
and
vividest
on
the
part
of
the
supersubtle
louis
was
his
french
treatment
of
certain
of
our
native
local
names
ohio
and
iowa
for
instance
which
he
rendered
as
to
their
separate
vowels
with
a
daintiness
and
a
delicacy
invidious
and
imperturbable
so
that
he
might
have
been
chateaubriand
declaiming
les
natchez
at
madame
récamier
and
a
proceeding
in
him
a
violence
offered
to
his
serried
circle
of
little
staring
and
glaring
new
yorkers
supplied
with
the
usual
allowance
of
fists
and
which
as
it
was
clearly
conscious
i
recollect
thinking
unsurpassed
for
cool
calm
courage
those
the
right
names
which
we
owed
wholly
to
the
french
explorers
and
jesuit
fathers
so
much
the
worse
for
us
if
we
vulgarly
did
know
it
i
lose
myself
in
admiration
of
the
consistency
the
superiority
the
sublimity
of
the
not
at
all
yet
in
his
own
way
so
singularly
sporting
louis
he
was
naturally
and
incorruptibly
french
as
so
oddly
i
have
known
other
persons
of
both
sexes
to
be
whose
english
was
naturally
and
incorruptibly
american
the
appearance
being
thus
that
the
possession
of
indigenous
english
alone
forms
the
adequate
barrier
and
the
assured
racial
ground
oh
the
queer
reversions
observed
on
the
part
of
latinized
compatriots
in
the
course
of
a
long
life
the
remarkable
drops
from
the
quite
current
french
or
italian
to
the
comparatively
improvised
native
idiom
with
the
resulting
effect
of
the
foreign
tongue
used
as
a
domestic
and
the
domestic
that
is
the
original
american
used
as
a
foreign
tongue
or
without
inherited
confidence
louis
de
coppet
though
theoretically
american
and
domiciled
was
french
and
so
pressed
further
home
to
me
that
sense
of
europe
to
which
i
feel
that
my
very
earliest
consciousness
waked
a
perversity
that
will
doubtless
appear
to
ask
for
all
the
justification
i
can
supply
and
some
of
which
i
shall
presently
attempt
to
give
he
opened
vistas
and
i
count
ever
as
precious
anyone
everyone
who
betimes
does
that
for
the
small
straining
vision
performing
this
office
never
so
much
doubtless
as
when
during
that
summer
he
invited
me
to
collaborate
with
him
in
the
production
of
a
romance
which
se
fit
to
get
printed
to
get
published
when
success
or
in
other
words
completion
should
crown
our
effort
our
effort
alas
failed
of
the
crown
in
spite
of
sundry
solemn
and
mysterious
meetings
so
much
devoted
i
seem
to
remember
to
the
publishing
question
that
others
more
fundamental
dreadfully
languished
leaving
me
convinced
however
that
my
friend
would
have
got
our
fiction
published
if
he
could
only
have
got
it
written
i
think
of
my
participation
in
this
vain
dream
as
of
the
very
first
gage
of
visiting
approval
offered
to
the
exercise
of
a
gift
though
quite
unable
to
conceive
my
companion
ground
for
suspecting
a
gift
of
which
i
must
at
that
time
quite
have
failed
to
exhibit
a
single
in
the
least
phenomenal
symptom
it
had
none
the
less
by
his
overtures
been
handsomely
to
me
that
was
in
a
manner
a
beginning
a
small
start
yet
not
wholly
unattended
with
bravery
louis
de
coppet
i
must
add
brought
to
light
later
on
so
far
as
i
know
no
compositions
of
his
own
we
met
him
long
after
in
switzerland
and
eventually
heard
of
his
having
married
a
young
russian
lady
and
settled
at
nice
if
i
drop
on
his
memory
this
apology
for
a
it
is
from
the
fact
of
his
having
given
the
earliest
or
at
least
the
most
personal
tap
to
that
pointed
prefigurement
of
the
manners
of
europe
which
inserted
if
not
to
say
into
my
young
allegiance
was
to
split
the
tender
organ
into
such
unequal
halves
his
the
toy
hammer
that
drove
in
the
very
point
of
the
golden
nail
it
was
as
if
there
had
been
a
mild
magic
in
that
breath
however
scant
of
another
world
but
when
i
ask
myself
what
element
of
the
pleasing
or
the
agreeable
may
have
glimmered
through
the
then
general
the
outer
and
enveloping
conditions
i
recover
many
more
of
the
connections
in
which
forms
and
civilities
lapsed
beyond
repair
than
of
those
in
which
they
struggled
at
all
successfully
it
is
for
some
record
of
the
question
of
taste
of
the
consciousness
of
an
æsthetic
appeal
as
reflected
in
forms
and
aspects
that
i
shall
like
best
to
testify
as
the
promise
and
the
development
of
these
things
on
our
earlier
american
scene
are
the
more
interesting
to
trace
for
their
doubtless
demanding
a
degree
of
the
finer
attention
the
plain
and
happy
profusions
and
advances
and
successes
as
one
looks
back
reflect
themselves
at
every
turn
the
quick
beats
of
material
increase
and
multiplication
with
plenty
of
people
to
tell
of
them
and
throw
up
their
caps
for
them
but
the
edifying
matters
to
recapture
would
be
the
adventures
of
the
higher
criticism
so
far
as
there
was
any
and
so
far
too
as
it
might
bear
on
the
real
quality
and
virtue
of
things
the
state
of
manners
the
terms
of
intercourse
the
care
for
excellence
the
sense
of
appearances
the
intellectual
reaction
generally
however
any
breasting
of
those
deep
waters
must
be
but
in
the
form
for
me
of
an
occasional
dip
it
meanwhile
fairly
overtakes
and
arrests
me
here
as
a
contributive
truth
that
our
general
medium
of
life
in
the
situation
i
speak
of
was
such
as
to
make
a
large
defensive
verandah
which
seems
to
have
very
stoutly
and
completely
surrounded
us
play
more
or
less
the
part
of
a
raft
of
rescue
in
too
high
a
tide
too
high
a
tide
there
beneath
us
as
i
recover
it
of
the
ugly
and
the
graceless
my
particular
perspective
may
magnify
a
little
wildly
when
it
does
even
more
weirdly
diminish
but
i
read
into
the
great
hooded
and
guarded
resource
in
question
an
evidential
force
as
if
it
must
really
have
played
for
us
so
far
as
its
narrowness
and
its
exposure
permitted
the
part
of
a
against
the
wilderness
immediately
near
that
of
the
empty
the
unlovely
and
the
mean
interposing
a
little
ease
did
it
interpose
almost
all
the
ease
we
knew
so
that
when
amiable
friends
arriving
from
new
york
by
the
boat
came
to
see
us
there
was
no
rural
view
for
them
but
that
of
our
great
shame
a
view
of
the
pigs
and
the
shanties
and
the
loose
planks
and
scattered
refuse
and
rude
public
ways
never
even
a
for
a
gentle
walk
or
a
garden
nook
in
afternoon
shade
i
recall
my
prompt
distaste
a
strange
precocity
of
criticism
for
so
much
aridity
since
of
what
lost
arcadia
at
that
age
had
i
really
had
the
least
glimpse
our
scant
margin
must
have
affected
me
more
nobly
i
should
in
justice
add
when
old
passed
or
hovered
for
she
sometimes
caustically
joined
the
circle
and
sometimes
during
the
highest
temperatures
which
were
very
high
that
summer
but
flitted
across
it
in
a
single
flowing
garment
as
we
amazedly
conceived
one
of
the
signs
of
that
grand
impertinence
i
supposed
which
belonged
to
dowagers
dowagers
who
were
recognised
characters
and
free
speakers
doing
and
saying
what
they
liked
this
ancient
lady
was
lodged
in
some
outlying
tract
of
the
house
which
in
more
than
one
quarter
stretched
away
into
mystery
but
the
piazza
to
which
she
had
access
was
unbroken
and
whenever
she
strayed
from
her
own
territory
she
swam
afresh
into
ours
i
definitely
remember
that
having
heard
and
perhaps
read
of
dowagers
who
as
i
was
aware
had
scarce
been
provided
for
in
our
social
scheme
i
said
to
myself
at
first
sight
of
our
emphatic
neighbour
a
person
clearly
used
to
exceptional
deference
this
must
be
a
perfect
specimen
which
was
somehow
very
wonderful
the
absolute
first
sight
however
had
preceded
the
new
brighton
summer
and
it
makes
me
lose
myself
in
a
queer
dim
vision
all
the
obscurities
attendant
on
my
having
been
present
as
a
very
small
boy
indeed
at
an
evening
entertainment
where
figured
in
an
attire
that
is
still
vivid
to
me
a
blue
satin
gown
a
long
black
lace
shawl
and
a
consisting
in
equally
striking
parts
of
a
brown
wig
a
plume
of
some
sort
waving
over
it
and
a
band
or
fillet
whether
of
some
precious
metal
or
not
i
forget
keeping
it
in
place
by
the
aid
of
a
precious
stone
which
adorned
the
centre
of
her
brow
such
was
my
first
view
of
the
of
our
grandmothers
when
not
of
our
greatgrandmothers
i
see
its
wearer
at
this
day
bend
that
burdened
brow
upon
me
in
a
manner
sufficiently
awful
while
her
knuckly
white
gloves
toyed
with
a
large
fan
and
a
vinaigrette
attached
to
her
thumb
by
a
chain
and
as
she
was
known
to
us
afterwards
for
a
friend
of
my
albany
grandmother
it
may
have
been
as
a
tribute
to
this
tie
that
she
allowed
me
momentarily
to
engage
her
attention
it
predominantly
must
have
been
that
i
knew
her
for
a
dowager
though
this
was
a
light
in
which
i
had
never
considered
my
grandmother
herself
but
what
i
have
quite
lost
the
clue
to
is
the
question
of
my
extraordinary
footing
in
such
an
assembly
the
occasion
of
a
dance
of
my
elders
youthful
elders
but
young
married
people
into
which
really
my
mother
as
a
participant
must
have
introduced
me
iv
it
took
place
in
the
house
of
our
cousins
robert
and
kitty
emmet
the
elder
for
we
were
to
have
two
cousin
kittys
of
that
ilk
and
yet
another
consanguineous
robert
at
least
the
latter
name
being
naturally
among
them
all
of
a
pious
indeed
of
a
glorious
tradition
and
three
of
my
father
nieces
marrying
three
emmet
brothers
the
first
of
these
the
robert
aforesaid
catherine
james
daughter
of
my
uncle
augustus
his
then
quite
recent
and
as
i
remember
her
animated
and
attractive
bride
whose
fair
hair
framed
her
pointed
smile
in
full
and
front
curls
i
easily
evoke
as
my
first
apprehended
image
of
the
free
and
happy
young
woman
of
fashion
a
sign
of
the
wondrous
fact
that
ladies
might
live
for
pleasure
pleasure
always
pleasure
alone
she
was
distinguished
for
nothing
whatever
so
much
as
for
an
insatiable
love
of
the
dance
that
passion
in
which
i
think
of
the
good
the
best
new
york
society
of
the
time
as
having
capered
and
champagned
itself
away
her
younger
sister
gertrude
afterwards
married
to
james
or
more
inveterately
jim
pendleton
of
virginia
followed
close
upon
her
heels
literally
speaking
and
though
emulating
her
in
other
respects
too
was
to
last
through
many
troubles
much
longer
looking
extraordinarily
the
while
like
the
younger
portraits
of
queen
victoria
and
to
have
much
hospitality
showing
it
and
showing
everything
in
a
singularly
natural
way
for
a
considerable
collection
of
young
hobbledehoy
kinsmen
but
i
am
solicited
a
moment
longer
by
the
queer
little
issues
involved
as
if
a
social
light
would
somehow
stream
from
them
in
my
having
been
taken
a
mere
mite
of
observation
to
kitty
emmet
assembly
was
it
that
my
mother
really
felt
that
to
the
scrap
that
i
was
other
scraps
would
perhaps
strangely
adhere
to
the
extent
thus
of
something
to
distinguish
me
by
nothing
else
probably
having
as
yet
declared
itself
such
a
scrap
for
instance
as
the
fine
germ
of
this
actual
ferment
of
memory
and
play
of
fancy
a
retroactive
vision
almost
intense
of
the
faded
hour
and
a
fond
surrender
to
the
questions
with
which
it
bristles
all
the
female
relatives
on
my
father
side
who
reappear
to
me
in
these
evocations
strike
me
as
having
been
intensely
and
admirably
but
at
the
same
time
almost
indescribably
which
fact
connects
itself
for
the
brooding
painter
and
fond
analyst
with
fifty
other
matters
and
impressions
his
vision
of
a
whole
social
order
if
the
american
scene
might
indeed
have
been
said
at
that
time
to
be
positively
ordered
was
the
fact
that
the
dancing
passion
was
so
out
of
proportion
to
any
social
resource
just
one
of
the
signs
of
the
natural
and
for
that
matter
in
both
sexes
alike
of
the
artless
kindred
it
was
shining
to
us
that
jim
pendleton
had
a
yacht
though
i
was
not
smuggled
aboard
it
there
the
line
was
drawn
but
the
deck
must
have
been
more
used
for
the
german
than
for
other
manoeuvres
often
doubtless
under
the
lead
of
our
cousin
robert
the
eldest
of
the
many
light
irresponsibles
to
whom
my
father
was
uncle
distinct
to
me
still
being
the
image
of
that
phenomenally
lean
and
nimble
choreographic
hero
bob
james
to
us
always
who
almost
led
the
cotillion
on
from
generation
to
generation
his
smile
with
its
accent
from
the
stiff
points
of
his
long
moustache
and
the
brightly
hollow
orbits
of
his
eyes
helping
to
make
of
him
an
immemorial
elegant
skeleton
it
is
at
all
events
to
the
sound
of
fiddles
and
the
popping
of
corks
that
i
see
even
young
brides
as
well
as
young
grooms
originally
so
formed
to
please
and
to
prosper
as
our
hosts
of
the
restless
little
occasion
i
have
glanced
at
vanish
untimely
become
mysterious
and
legendary
with
such
unfathomed
silences
and
significant
headshakes
replacing
the
earlier
concert
so
that
i
feel
how
one
impression
of
so
much
foredoomed
youthful
levity
received
constant
and
quite
thrilling
increase
it
was
of
course
an
impression
then
obscurely
gathered
but
into
which
one
was
later
on
to
read
strange
pages
to
some
of
which
i
may
find
myself
moved
to
revert
mere
mite
of
observation
though
i
have
dubbed
myself
i
wo
pretend
to
have
deciphered
any
of
them
amid
the
bacchanal
sounds
that
on
the
evening
so
suggestively
spent
floated
out
into
the
region
of
washington
place
it
is
round
that
general
centre
that
my
richest
memories
of
the
gay
little
life
in
general
cluster
as
if
it
had
been
for
the
circle
in
which
i
seem
justified
in
pretending
to
have
moved
of
the
finer
essence
of
town
covering
as
it
did
the
stretch
of
broadway
down
to
canal
street
with
closer
at
hand
the
new
york
hotel
which
figured
somehow
inordinately
in
our
family
annals
the
two
newer
ones
the
glory
of
their
brief
and
discredited
their
flouted
and
demolished
age
the
brown
metropolitan
and
the
white
nicholas
were
much
further
down
and
rising
northward
to
the
ultima
thule
of
street
only
second
then
in
the
supposedly
ample
scheme
of
the
regular
ninth
wide
street
i
ca
indeed
have
moved
much
on
that
night
of
revelations
and
yet
of
enigmas
over
which
i
still
hang
fascinated
i
must
have
kept
intensely
still
in
my
corner
all
wondering
and
all
fearing
fearing
notice
most
and
in
a
definite
way
i
but
remember
the
formidable
interest
of
my
so
convincing
dowager
to
hark
back
for
a
second
to
and
the
fact
that
a
great
smooth
white
cloth
was
spread
across
the
denuded
room
converted
thus
into
a
field
of
frolic
the
prospect
of
which
much
excited
my
curiosity
i
but
recover
the
preparations
however
without
recovering
the
performance
and
i
must
have
been
the
only
persons
not
shaking
a
foot
and
premature
unconsciousness
clearly
in
my
case
supervened
out
of
it
peeps
again
the
riddle
the
so
quaint
de
of
my
infant
participation
but
i
set
that
down
as
representative
and
interesting
and
have
done
with
it
the
manners
of
the
time
had
obviously
a
of
their
own
certainly
so
on
our
particularly
indulgent
and
humane
little
field
as
to
which
general
proposition
the
later
applications
and
transformations
of
the
bonhomie
would
be
interesting
to
trace
it
has
lingered
and
fermented
and
earned
other
names
but
i
seem
on
the
track
of
its
prime
evidence
with
that
note
of
the
sovereign
ease
of
all
the
young
persons
with
whom
we
grew
up
in
the
as
our
view
took
in
with
new
climes
and
new
scenes
other
examples
of
the
class
these
were
always
to
affect
us
as
more
formed
and
finished
more
tutored
and
governessed
warned
and
armed
at
more
points
for
and
doubtless
often
against
the
social
relation
so
that
this
prepared
state
on
their
part
and
which
at
first
appeared
but
a
preparation
for
shyness
or
silence
or
whatever
other
ideal
of
the
unconversable
came
to
be
for
us
the
normal
since
it
was
the
relative
and
not
the
positive
still
less
the
superlative
state
no
charming
creatures
of
the
growing
girl
sort
were
ever
to
be
natural
in
the
degree
of
these
nearer
and
remoter
ornaments
of
our
family
circle
in
youth
when
after
intervals
and
absences
the
impression
was
renewed
we
saw
how
right
we
had
been
about
it
and
i
feel
as
if
we
had
watched
it
for
years
under
the
apprehension
and
the
vision
of
some
inevitable
change
wondering
with
an
affectionate
interest
what
effect
the
general
improvement
in
manners
might
perhaps
all
unfortunately
have
upon
it
i
make
out
as
i
look
back
that
it
was
really
to
succumb
at
no
point
to
this
complication
that
it
was
to
keep
its
really
quite
inimitable
freshness
to
the
end
or
in
other
words
when
it
had
been
the
first
free
growth
of
the
old
conditions
was
to
pass
away
but
with
the
passing
of
those
themselves
for
whom
it
had
been
the
sole
possible
expression
for
it
was
as
of
an
altogether
special
shade
and
sort
that
the
new
york
young
naturalness
of
our
prime
was
touchingly
to
linger
with
us
so
that
to
myself
at
present
with
only
the
gentle
ghosts
of
the
so
numerous
exemplars
of
it
before
me
it
becomes
the
very
stuff
of
the
soft
cerements
in
which
their
general
mild
mortality
is
laid
away
we
used
to
have
in
the
amid
fresh
recognitions
and
reminders
the
kindest
old
new
york
identifications
for
it
the
special
shade
of
its
identity
was
thus
that
it
was
not
conscious
really
not
conscious
of
anything
in
the
world
or
was
conscious
of
so
few
possibilities
at
least
and
these
so
immediate
and
so
a
matter
of
course
that
it
came
almost
to
the
same
thing
that
was
the
testimony
that
the
slight
subjects
in
question
strike
me
as
having
borne
to
their
surrounding
medium
the
fact
that
their
unconsciousness
could
be
so
preserved
they
played
about
in
it
so
happily
and
serenely
and
sociably
as
unembarrassed
and
loquacious
as
they
were
unadmonished
and
uninformed
only
aware
at
the
most
that
a
good
many
people
within
their
horizon
were
dissipated
as
in
point
of
fact
alas
a
good
many
what
it
was
to
be
dissipated
that
however
was
but
in
the
most
limited
degree
a
feature
of
their
vision
they
would
have
held
under
pressure
that
it
consisted
more
than
anything
else
in
getting
tipsy
infinitely
queer
and
quaint
almost
incongruously
droll
the
sense
somehow
begotten
in
ourselves
as
very
young
persons
of
our
being
surrounded
by
a
slightly
remote
yet
dimly
rich
outer
and
quite
kindred
circle
of
the
tipsy
i
remember
how
once
as
a
very
small
boy
after
meeting
in
the
hall
a
most
amiable
and
irreproachable
gentleman
all
but
closely
consanguineous
who
had
come
to
call
on
my
mother
i
anticipated
his
further
entrance
by
slipping
in
to
report
to
that
parent
that
i
thought
must
be
tipsy
and
i
was
to
recall
perfectly
afterwards
the
impression
i
so
made
on
her
in
which
the
general
proposition
that
the
gentlemen
of
a
certain
group
or
connection
might
on
occasion
be
best
described
by
the
term
i
had
used
sought
to
destroy
the
particular
presumption
that
our
visitor
would
by
his
ordinary
measure
show
himself
for
one
of
those
he
did
to
all
appearance
for
i
was
afterwards
disappointed
at
the
lapse
of
lurid
evidence
that
memory
remained
with
me
as
well
as
a
considerable
subsequent
wonder
at
my
having
leaped
to
so
baseless
a
view
the
truth
was
indeed
that
we
had
too
in
the
most
innocent
way
in
the
world
our
sense
of
dissipation
as
an
abounding
element
in
family
histories
a
sense
fed
quite
directly
by
our
fondness
for
making
our
father
i
can
at
any
rate
testify
for
the
urgency
of
my
own
appeal
to
him
tell
us
stories
of
the
world
of
his
youth
he
regaled
us
with
no
scandals
yet
it
somehow
rarely
failed
to
come
out
that
each
contemporary
on
his
younger
scene
each
hero
of
each
thrilling
adventure
had
in
spite
of
brilliant
promise
and
romantic
charm
ended
badly
as
badly
as
possible
this
became
our
gaping
generalisation
it
gaped
even
under
the
moral
that
the
anecdote
was
always
and
so
familiarly
humanly
and
vividly
designed
to
convey
everyone
in
the
little
old
albany
of
the
dutch
houses
and
the
steep
streets
and
the
recurrent
family
names
townsends
clintons
van
rensselaers
pruyns
i
pick
them
up
again
at
hazard
and
all
uninvidiously
out
of
reverberations
long
since
still
everyone
without
exception
had
at
last
taken
a
turn
as
far
as
possible
from
edifying
and
what
they
had
most
in
common
the
hovering
presences
the
fitful
apparitions
that
speaking
for
myself
so
engaged
my
imagination
was
just
the
fine
old
albany
drama
in
the
light
of
which
a
ring
of
mystery
as
to
their
lives
mainly
carried
on
at
the
new
york
hotel
aforesaid
surrounded
them
and
their
charm
inveterate
as
i
believed
shone
out
as
through
their
charm
was
in
various
marks
of
which
i
shall
have
more
to
say
for
as
i
breathe
all
this
hushed
air
again
even
the
more
broken
things
give
out
touching
human
values
and
faint
sweet
scents
of
character
flushes
of
old
beauty
and
the
grim
little
generalisation
remained
none
the
less
and
i
may
speak
of
it
since
i
speak
of
everything
as
still
standing
the
striking
evidence
that
scarce
aught
but
disaster
in
that
so
unformed
and
unseasoned
society
overtake
young
men
who
were
in
the
least
exposed
not
to
have
been
immediately
launched
in
business
of
a
rigorous
sort
was
to
exposed
in
the
absence
i
mean
of
some
fairly
abnormal
predisposition
to
virtue
since
it
was
a
world
so
simply
constituted
that
whatever
was
business
or
exactly
an
office
or
a
store
places
in
which
people
sat
close
and
made
money
was
just
simply
pleasure
sought
and
sought
only
in
places
in
which
people
got
tipsy
there
was
clearly
no
mean
least
of
all
the
golden
one
for
it
was
just
the
ready
even
when
the
moderate
possession
of
gold
that
determined
that
hurried
on
disaster
there
were
whole
sets
and
groups
there
were
sympathetic
though
too
susceptible
races
that
seemed
scarce
to
recognise
or
to
find
possible
any
practical
application
of
moneyed
that
is
of
transmitted
ease
however
limited
but
to
go
more
or
less
rapidly
to
the
bad
with
it
which
meant
even
then
going
as
often
as
possible
to
paris
the
bright
and
empty
air
was
as
void
of
careers
for
a
choice
as
of
cathedral
towers
for
a
sketcher
and
i
passed
my
younger
time
till
within
a
year
or
two
of
the
civil
war
with
an
absolute
vagueness
of
impression
as
to
how
the
political
life
of
the
country
was
carried
on
the
field
was
strictly
covered
to
my
young
eyes
i
make
out
by
three
classes
the
busy
the
tipsy
and
daniel
webster
this
last
great
man
must
have
represented
for
us
a
class
in
himself
as
if
to
be
political
was
just
to
daniel
webster
in
his
proper
person
and
with
room
left
over
for
nobody
else
that
he
should
have
filled
the
sky
of
public
life
from
pole
to
pole
even
to
a
childish
consciousness
not
formed
in
new
england
and
for
which
that
strenuous
section
was
but
a
name
in
the
is
probably
indeed
a
sign
of
how
large
in
the
general
air
he
comparatively
loomed
the
public
scene
was
otherwise
a
blank
to
our
young
vision
i
discern
till
later
on
in
paris
i
saw
for
at
that
unimproved
period
we
of
the
unfledged
did
suppose
ourselves
to
meet
charles
sumner
with
whose
name
indeed
there
further
connects
itself
the
image
of
a
thrilled
hour
in
the
same
city
some
months
before
the
gathering
of
a
group
of
indignant
persons
on
the
terrace
of
a
small
or
pavilion
looking
out
on
the
avenue
des
champs
elysées
slightly
above
the
and
just
opposite
the
antediluvian
jardin
who
remembers
the
jardin
who
remembers
the
ancient
lodges
of
the
the
pair
of
them
facing
each
other
at
the
barrière
de
and
among
them
a
passionate
lady
in
tears
over
the
news
fresh
that
morning
of
the
assault
on
sumner
by
the
south
carolina
ruffian
of
the
house
the
wounded
senator
injured
in
health
had
come
to
europe
later
on
to
recuperate
and
he
offered
me
my
first
view
to
the
best
of
my
belief
not
only
of
a
statesman
but
of
any
person
whomsoever
concerned
in
political
life
i
distinguish
in
the
earlier
twilight
of
fourteenth
street
my
return
to
us
one
november
day
we
knew
he
had
been
out
to
vote
with
the
news
that
general
winfield
scott
his
and
the
then
whig
candidate
had
been
defeated
for
the
presidency
just
as
i
rescue
from
the
same
limbo
my
afterwards
proud
little
impression
of
having
met
that
hero
of
the
mexican
war
whom
the
civil
war
was
so
soon
and
with
so
little
ceremony
to
extinguish
literally
met
him
at
my
father
side
in
fifth
avenue
where
he
had
just
emerged
from
a
i
remain
vague
as
to
what
had
then
happened
and
scarce
suppose
i
was
at
the
age
probably
of
eight
or
nine
presented
but
we
must
have
been
for
some
moments
face
to
face
while
from
under
the
vast
amplitude
of
a
dark
blue
military
cloak
with
a
big
velvet
collar
and
loosened
silver
clasp
which
spread
about
him
like
a
symbol
of
the
tented
field
he
greeted
my
parent
so
clear
is
my
sense
of
the
time
it
took
me
to
gape
the
way
up
to
where
he
towered
aloft
v
the
not
very
glorious
smoke
of
the
mexican
war
i
note
for
another
touch
had
been
in
the
air
when
i
was
a
still
smaller
boy
and
i
have
an
association
with
it
that
hovers
between
the
definite
and
the
dim
a
vision
of
our
uncle
captain
as
he
then
was
robert
temple
in
regimentals
either
on
his
way
to
the
scene
of
action
or
on
the
return
from
it
i
see
him
as
a
person
half
asleep
sees
some
large
object
across
the
room
and
against
the
even
if
to
the
effect
of
my
now
asking
myself
why
so
far
from
the
scene
of
action
he
was
in
panoply
of
war
i
seem
to
see
him
and
feathered
too
an
odd
vision
of
dancing
superior
plumes
which
does
fit
if
he
was
only
a
captain
however
i
cultivate
the
wavering
shade
merely
for
its
value
as
my
earliest
glimpse
of
any
circumstance
of
the
public
order
unless
indeed
another
the
reminiscence
to
which
i
owe
my
sharpest
sense
of
personal
antiquity
had
already
given
me
the
historic
thrill
the
scene
of
this
latter
stir
of
consciousness
is
for
memory
an
apartment
in
one
of
the
three
fifth
avenue
houses
that
were
not
long
afterward
swallowed
up
in
the
present
brevoort
hotel
and
consists
of
the
admired
appearance
of
my
uncles
gus
and
john
james
to
announce
to
my
father
that
the
revolution
had
triumphed
in
paris
and
louis
philippe
had
fled
to
england
these
last
words
the
flight
of
the
king
linger
on
my
ear
at
this
hour
even
as
they
fell
there
we
had
somehow
waked
early
to
a
perception
of
paris
and
a
vibration
of
my
very
most
infantine
sensibility
under
its
sky
had
by
the
same
stroke
got
itself
preserved
for
subsequent
wondering
reference
i
had
been
there
for
a
short
time
in
the
second
year
of
my
life
and
i
was
to
communicate
to
my
parents
later
on
that
as
a
baby
in
long
clothes
seated
opposite
to
them
in
a
carriage
and
on
the
lap
of
another
person
i
had
been
impressed
with
the
view
framed
by
the
clear
window
of
the
vehicle
as
we
passed
of
a
great
stately
square
surrounded
with
houses
and
having
in
its
centre
a
tall
and
glorious
column
i
had
naturally
caused
them
to
marvel
but
i
had
also
under
forced
them
to
compare
notes
as
it
were
and
reconstitute
the
miracle
they
knew
what
my
observation
of
monumental
squares
had
been
and
alas
had
neither
new
york
nor
albany
could
have
offered
me
the
splendid
perspective
and
for
that
matter
neither
could
london
which
moreover
i
had
known
at
a
younger
age
still
conveyed
along
the
rue
while
i
waggled
my
small
feet
as
i
definitely
remember
doing
under
my
flowing
robe
i
had
crossed
the
rue
de
castiglione
and
taken
in
for
all
my
time
the
admirable
aspect
of
the
place
and
the
colonne
vendôme
i
do
now
pretend
to
measure
the
extent
to
which
my
interest
in
the
events
of
i
was
five
years
old
was
quickened
by
that
a
tradition
further
reinforced
i
should
add
by
the
fact
that
some
relative
or
other
some
member
of
our
circle
was
always
either
there
there
being
of
course
generally
europe
but
particularly
and
pointedly
paris
or
going
there
or
coming
back
from
there
i
at
any
rate
revert
to
the
sound
of
the
rich
words
on
my
uncles
lips
as
to
my
positive
initiation
into
history
it
was
as
if
i
had
been
ready
for
them
and
could
catch
on
i
had
heard
of
kings
presumably
and
also
of
fleeing
but
that
kings
had
sometimes
to
flee
was
a
new
and
striking
image
to
which
the
apparent
consternation
of
my
elders
added
dramatic
force
so
much
in
any
case
for
what
i
may
claim
perhaps
too
idly
on
behalf
of
my
backward
reach
it
has
carried
me
far
from
my
rather
evident
proposition
that
if
we
saw
the
natural
so
happily
embodied
about
us
and
in
female
maturity
or
comparative
maturity
scarce
less
than
in
female
adolescence
this
was
because
the
artificial
or
in
other
words
the
complicated
was
so
little
there
to
threaten
it
the
complicated
as
we
were
later
on
to
define
it
was
but
another
name
for
those
more
massed
and
violent
assaults
upon
the
social
sense
that
we
were
to
recognise
subsequently
by
their
effects
observing
thus
that
a
sense
more
subtly
social
had
so
been
created
and
that
it
quite
differed
from
that
often
almost
complete
inward
blankness
in
respect
to
any
circumjacent
any
constituted
order
to
the
exhibition
of
which
our
earlier
air
and
our
family
scene
had
inimitably
treated
us
we
came
more
or
less
to
see
that
our
young
contemporaries
of
another
world
the
trained
and
admonished
the
disciplined
and
governessed
or
in
a
word
the
formed
relatively
speaking
had
been
made
aware
of
many
things
of
which
those
at
home
had
been
yet
we
were
also
to
note
so
far
as
we
may
be
conceived
as
so
precociously
noting
though
we
were
certainly
incorrigible
observers
that
the
awareness
in
question
remaining
at
the
best
imperfect
our
little
friends
as
distinguished
from
our
companions
of
the
cousinship
greater
and
less
advanced
and
presumed
but
to
flounder
and
recede
elated
at
once
and
abashed
and
on
the
whole
but
sophisticated
the
cousinship
on
the
other
hand
all
unalarmed
and
unsuspecting
and
unembarrassed
lived
by
pure
serenity
sociability
and
loquacity
the
oddest
fact
about
its
members
being
withal
that
it
make
them
bores
i
seem
to
feel
as
i
look
back
or
at
least
not
worse
bores
than
sundry
specimens
of
the
other
growth
there
can
surely
never
have
been
anything
like
their
good
faith
and
generally
speaking
their
amiability
i
should
have
but
to
let
myself
go
a
little
to
wish
to
cite
examples
save
that
in
doing
so
i
should
lose
sight
of
my
point
which
is
to
recall
again
that
whether
we
were
all
amiable
or
not
and
frankly
i
claim
it
in
a
high
degree
for
most
of
us
the
scene
on
which
we
so
freely
bloomed
does
strike
me
when
i
reckon
up
as
extraordinarily
unfurnished
how
came
it
then
that
for
the
most
part
so
simple
we
yet
were
more
inane
this
was
doubtless
by
reason
of
the
quantity
of
our
inward
life
ours
of
our
father
house
in
especial
i
mean
which
made
an
excellent
in
some
cases
almost
an
incomparable
for
a
thicker
civility
to
mix
with
when
growing
experience
should
begin
to
take
that
in
it
was
also
quaint
among
us
i
may
be
reminded
to
have
with
the
inward
life
but
we
began
after
the
manner
of
all
men
as
we
could
and
i
hold
that
if
it
comes
to
that
we
might
have
begun
much
worse
i
was
in
my
seventeenth
year
when
the
raid
and
the
capture
of
john
brown
of
harper
ferry
fame
enjoyed
its
sharp
reverberation
among
us
though
we
were
then
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
and
i
count
this
as
the
very
first
reminder
that
reached
me
of
our
living
on
our
side
in
a
political
order
i
had
perfectly
taken
in
from
the
pages
of
punch
which
contributed
in
the
highest
degree
to
our
education
that
the
peoples
on
the
other
side
so
lived
as
there
was
no
american
punch
and
to
this
time
has
been
none
to
give
small
boys
the
sense
and
the
imagination
of
living
with
their
public
administrators
daniel
webster
and
charles
sumner
had
never
become
for
my
fancy
members
of
a
class
a
class
which
numbered
in
england
by
john
leech
showing
so
many
other
members
still
than
lords
brougham
palmerston
and
john
russell
the
war
of
secession
soon
arriving
was
to
cause
the
field
to
bristle
with
features
and
the
sense
of
the
state
in
our
generation
infinitely
to
quicken
but
that
alarm
came
upon
the
country
like
a
thief
at
night
and
we
might
all
have
been
living
in
a
land
in
which
there
seemed
at
least
nothing
save
a
comparatively
small
amount
of
quite
private
property
to
steal
even
private
property
in
other
than
the
most
modest
amounts
scarce
figured
for
our
particular
selves
which
doubtless
came
partly
from
the
fact
that
amid
all
the
albany
issue
there
was
ease
with
the
habit
of
ease
thanks
to
our
grandfather
fine
old
ability
he
had
decently
provided
for
so
large
a
generation
but
our
consciousness
was
positively
disfurnished
as
that
of
young
americans
went
of
the
actualities
of
business
in
a
world
of
business
as
to
that
we
all
formed
together
quite
a
monstrous
exception
business
in
a
world
of
business
was
the
thing
we
most
agreed
differ
as
we
might
on
minor
issues
in
knowing
nothing
about
we
touched
it
and
it
touched
us
neither
directly
nor
otherwise
and
i
think
our
fond
detachment
not
to
say
our
helpless
ignorance
and
on
occasion
since
i
can
speak
for
one
fine
instance
our
settled
density
of
understanding
made
us
an
unexampled
and
probably
for
the
ironic
smart
gods
of
the
american
heaven
a
lamentable
case
of
course
even
the
office
and
the
store
leave
much
of
the
provision
for
an
approximately
complete
scheme
of
manners
to
be
accounted
for
still
there
must
have
been
vast
numbers
of
people
about
us
for
whom
under
the
usages
the
assault
on
the
imagination
from
without
was
much
stronger
and
the
of
the
general
picture
much
richer
it
was
exactly
by
the
lack
of
that
that
we
we
more
especially
who
lived
at
near
view
of
my
father
admirable
example
had
been
thrown
so
upon
the
inward
life
no
one
could
ever
have
taken
to
it
even
in
the
face
of
discouragement
more
kindly
and
naturally
than
he
but
the
situation
had
at
least
that
charm
that
in
default
of
so
many
kinds
of
the
outward
people
had
their
choice
of
as
many
kinds
of
the
inward
as
they
would
and
might
practise
those
kinds
with
whatever
consistency
intensity
and
brilliancy
of
our
father
perfect
gift
for
practising
kind
i
shall
have
more
to
say
but
i
meanwhile
glance
yet
again
at
those
felicities
of
destitution
which
kept
us
collectively
so
genially
interested
in
almost
nothing
but
each
other
and
which
come
over
me
now
as
one
of
the
famous
blessings
in
disguise
there
were
artists
in
the
prospect
did
tom
hicks
and
paul
duggan
and
cranch
and
felix
darley
this
last
worthy
of
a
wider
reputation
capable
perhaps
even
of
a
finer
development
than
he
attained
more
or
less
haunt
our
friendly
fireside
and
give
us
also
the
sense
of
others
landscapist
cropseys
and
coles
and
kensetts
and
iveses
and
powerses
and
moziers
hovering
in
an
outer
circle
there
were
authors
not
less
some
of
them
vague
and
female
and
in
this
case
as
a
rule
glossily
ringletted
and
monumentally
breastpinned
but
mostly
frequent
and
familiar
after
the
manner
of
george
curtis
and
parke
godwin
and
george
ripley
and
charles
dana
and
willis
and
for
brighter
lights
or
those
that
in
our
then
comparative
obscurity
almost
deceived
the
morn
bryant
washington
irving
and
poe
the
of
whom
i
cite
not
so
much
because
he
was
personally
present
the
extremity
of
personal
absence
had
just
overtaken
him
as
by
reason
of
that
predominant
lustre
in
him
which
our
small
opening
minds
themselves
already
recognised
and
which
makes
me
wonder
at
the
legend
of
the
native
neglect
of
him
was
he
not
even
at
that
time
on
all
lips
had
not
my
brother
promptly
master
of
the
subject
beckoned
on
my
lagging
mind
with
a
recital
of
the
and
the
pit
and
the
pendulum
both
of
which
however
i
was
soon
enough
to
read
for
myself
adding
to
them
the
murders
in
the
rue
morgue
were
we
not
also
forever
mounting
on
little
platforms
at
our
infant
schools
to
speak
the
raven
and
lenore
and
the
verses
in
which
we
phrased
the
heroine
as
annabellee
falling
thus
into
the
trap
the
poet
had
so
recklessly
laid
for
us
as
he
had
laid
one
for
our
interminable
droning
not
less
in
the
other
pieces
i
have
named
so
far
from
misprizing
our
magician
we
acclaimed
him
surely
at
every
turn
he
lay
upon
our
tables
and
resounded
in
our
mouths
while
we
communed
to
satiety
even
for
boyish
appetites
over
the
thrill
of
his
choicest
pages
i
just
recognise
the
ghost
of
a
dim
memory
of
a
children
christmas
party
at
the
house
of
fourteenth
street
neighbours
they
come
back
to
me
as
the
beans
who
and
what
and
whence
and
whither
the
kindly
beans
where
i
admired
over
the
chimney
piece
the
portrait
of
a
lady
seated
on
the
ground
in
a
turkish
dress
with
hair
flowing
loose
from
a
cap
which
was
not
as
the
caps
of
ladies
known
to
me
and
i
think
with
a
tambourine
who
was
somehow
identified
to
my
enquiring
mind
as
the
wife
of
the
painter
of
the
piece
osgood
and
the
so
ministering
friend
of
the
unhappy
poe
there
she
throned
in
honour
like
queen
constance
on
the
huge
firm
earth
all
for
and
her
tambourine
and
surely
we
could
none
of
us
have
done
more
for
the
connection
washington
irving
i
met
with
infant
promptitude
very
much
as
i
had
met
general
scott
only
this
time
it
was
on
a
steamboat
that
i
apprehended
the
great
man
my
father
under
whose
protection
i
then
was
during
the
summer
afternoon
sail
from
new
york
to
fort
hamilton
having
named
him
to
me
for
this
long
preservation
before
they
greeted
and
talked
and
having
a
fact
of
still
more
moment
to
mention
with
the
greatest
concern
afterwards
irving
had
given
him
the
news
of
the
shipwreck
of
margaret
fuller
in
those
very
waters
fire
island
at
least
was
but
just
without
our
big
bay
during
the
great
august
storm
that
had
within
the
day
or
two
passed
over
us
the
unfortunate
lady
was
essentially
of
the
boston
connection
but
she
must
have
been
and
probably
through
emerson
a
friend
of
my
parents
she
have
held
conversations
in
the
finest
exotic
bostonese
in
new
york
emerson
himself
lecturing
there
to
admiration
since
the
more
i
squeeze
the
sponge
of
memory
the
more
its
stored
secretions
flow
to
remind
me
here
again
that
being
with
those
elders
late
one
evening
at
an
exhibition
of
pictures
possibly
that
of
the
national
academy
then
confined
to
scant
quarters
i
was
shown
a
small
portrait
of
miss
fuller
seated
as
now
appears
to
me
and
wrapped
in
a
long
white
shawl
the
failure
of
which
to
do
justice
to
its
original
my
companions
denounced
with
some
emphasis
was
this
work
from
the
hand
of
tom
hicks
aforesaid
or
was
that
artist
concerned
only
with
the
the
enormous
as
i
took
it
to
be
the
the
violently
protruded
accessories
in
which
come
back
to
me
with
my
infant
sense
of
the
wonder
and
the
beauty
of
them
as
expressed
above
all
in
the
image
of
a
very
long
and
lovely
lady
the
new
bride
of
the
artist
standing
at
a
window
before
a
row
of
plants
or
bulbs
in
tall
coloured
glasses
the
light
of
the
window
playing
over
the
figure
and
the
treatment
of
its
glass
and
of
the
and
the
other
furniture
passed
by
my
impression
for
the
sign
of
the
master
hand
and
it
all
brave
and
charming
or
was
it
only
very
hard
and
stiff
quite
ugly
and
helpless
i
put
these
questions
as
to
a
vanished
world
and
by
way
of
pressing
back
into
it
only
the
more
clingingly
and
tenderly
wholly
regardless
in
other
words
of
whether
the
answers
to
them
at
all
matter
they
matter
doubtless
but
for
fond
evocation
and
if
one
tries
to
evoke
one
must
neglect
none
of
the
arts
one
must
do
it
with
all
the
forms
why
i
so
like
to
do
it
is
another
matter
and
what
outside
interest
i
may
suppose
myself
to
create
perhaps
still
another
i
fatuously
proceed
at
any
rate
i
make
so
far
as
i
can
the
small
warm
dusky
homogeneous
new
york
world
of
the
close
about
us
vi
i
see
a
small
and
compact
and
ingenuous
society
screened
in
somehow
conveniently
from
north
and
west
but
open
wide
to
the
east
and
comparatively
to
the
south
and
though
perpetually
moving
up
broadway
none
the
less
constantly
and
delightfully
walking
down
it
broadway
was
the
feature
and
the
artery
the
joy
and
the
adventure
of
childhood
and
it
stretched
and
prodigiously
from
union
square
to
barnum
great
american
museum
by
the
city
hall
or
only
went
further
on
the
saturday
mornings
absurdly
and
deplorably
frequent
alas
when
we
were
swept
off
by
a
loving
aunt
our
mother
only
sister
then
much
domesticated
with
us
and
to
whom
the
ruthless
care
had
assigned
itself
from
the
first
to
wall
street
and
the
torture
chamber
of
parkhurst
our
tremendously
respectable
dentist
who
was
so
old
and
so
empurpled
and
so
polite
in
his
stock
and
and
dark
and
glossy
wig
that
he
had
been
our
mother
and
our
aunt
haunting
fear
in
youth
as
well
since
in
their
quiet
warren
street
not
far
off
they
were
dreadful
to
think
comparatively
under
his
thumb
he
extremely
resembles
to
my
mind
eye
certain
figures
in
phiz
illustrations
to
dickens
and
it
was
clear
to
us
through
our
long
ordeal
that
our
elders
must
by
some
mistaken
law
of
compensation
some
refinement
of
the
vindictive
be
making
us
pay
for
what
they
in
like
helplessness
had
suffered
from
him
as
if
had
done
them
any
harm
our
analysis
was
muddled
yet
in
a
manner
relieving
and
for
us
too
there
were
compensations
which
we
grudged
indeed
to
allow
but
which
i
could
easily
even
if
shyly
have
named
one
of
these
was
godey
lady
book
a
sallow
pile
of
which
it
shows
to
me
for
sallow
in
the
warmer
and
less
stony
light
of
the
wall
street
of
those
days
and
through
the
smell
of
ancient
anodynes
lay
on
joey
bagstock
table
for
our
beguilement
while
we
waited
i
was
to
encounter
in
phiz
dombey
and
son
that
design
for
our
tormentor
type
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
i
succumbed
to
the
spell
of
godey
who
unlike
the
present
essences
was
an
anodyne
before
the
fact
as
well
as
after
since
i
remember
poring
in
his
pages
over
tales
of
fashionable
life
in
philadelphia
while
awaiting
my
turn
in
the
chair
not
less
than
doing
so
when
my
turn
was
over
and
to
the
music
of
my
brother
groans
this
must
have
been
at
the
hours
when
we
were
left
discreetly
to
our
own
fortitude
through
our
aunt
availing
herself
of
the
relative
proximity
to
go
and
shop
at
stewart
and
then
come
back
for
us
the
ladies
great
shop
vast
marmorean
and
notoriously
fatal
to
the
female
nerve
we
ourselves
had
wearily
trailed
through
it
hanging
on
the
skirts
very
literally
of
indecision
which
bravely
waylaid
custom
on
the
broadway
corner
of
chambers
street
part
of
the
charm
of
life
since
i
assume
that
there
such
a
charm
in
its
being
then
i
allude
to
life
itself
so
much
more
on
the
supposition
at
least
that
our
young
gravitation
in
that
sense
for
most
of
the
larger
joys
consorted
with
something
of
the
general
habit
the
joy
that
had
to
be
fished
out
like
truth
from
the
very
bottom
of
the
well
was
attendance
at
trinity
church
still
in
that
age
supereminent
pointedly
absolute
the
finest
feature
of
the
southward
scene
to
the
privilege
of
which
the
elder
albany
cousins
were
apt
to
be
treated
when
they
came
on
to
stay
with
us
an
indulgence
making
their
enjoyment
of
our
city
as
as
possible
too
for
i
seem
otherwise
to
see
them
but
as
returning
with
the
familiar
stewart
headache
from
the
prolonged
strain
of
selection
the
great
reward
dispensed
to
us
for
our
sessions
in
the
house
of
pain
as
to
which
it
became
our
subsequent
theory
that
we
had
been
regularly
dragged
there
on
alternate
saturdays
was
our
being
carried
on
the
return
to
the
house
of
delight
or
to
one
of
them
for
there
were
specifically
two
where
we
partook
of
deemed
sovereign
for
sore
mouths
deemed
sovereign
in
fact
all
through
our
infancy
for
everything
two
great
establishments
for
the
service
of
it
graced
the
prospect
one
thompson
and
the
other
taylor
the
former
i
perfectly
recall
grave
and
immemorial
the
latter
upstart
but
dazzling
and
having
together
the
effect
that
whichever
we
went
to
we
wondered
if
we
had
better
have
gone
to
the
other
with
that
capacity
of
childhood
for
making
the
most
of
its
adventures
after
a
fashion
that
may
look
so
like
making
the
least
it
is
in
our
father
company
indeed
that
as
i
press
the
responsive
spring
i
see
the
bedizened
saucers
heaped
up
for
our
fond
consumption
they
bore
the
painted
in
blue
and
gilded
with
the
christian
name
as
parentally
pointed
out
to
us
perverted
to
jhon
for
john
whereas
the
scorned
such
vulgar
and
above
all
such
misspelt
appeals
whence
i
infer
that
still
other
occasions
for
that
experience
waited
on
us
as
almost
any
would
serve
and
a
paternal
presence
so
associated
with
them
was
not
in
the
least
conceivable
in
the
wall
street
that
presence
is
in
fact
not
associated
for
me
to
any
effect
of
distinctness
with
the
least
of
our
suffered
shocks
or
penalties
though
partly
doubtless
because
our
acquaintance
with
such
was
of
the
most
limited
a
conclusion
i
form
even
while
judging
it
to
have
been
on
the
whole
sufficient
for
our
virtue
this
sounds
perhaps
as
if
we
had
borne
ourselves
as
prodigies
or
prigs
which
was
as
far
as
possible
from
being
the
case
we
were
bred
in
horror
of
propriety
of
what
my
father
was
fond
of
calling
flagrant
morality
what
i
myself
at
any
rate
read
back
into
our
rare
educational
ease
for
the
memory
of
some
sides
of
which
i
was
ever
to
be
thankful
is
besides
the
humanisation
of
our
apprehended
world
and
our
social
tone
the
unmistakeable
appearance
that
my
father
was
again
and
again
accompanied
in
public
by
his
small
second
son
so
many
young
impressions
come
back
to
me
as
gathered
at
his
side
and
in
his
personal
haunts
not
that
he
must
have
offered
his
firstborn
at
least
equal
opportunities
but
i
make
out
that
he
seldom
led
us
forth
such
as
we
were
together
and
my
brother
must
have
had
in
turn
many
a
mild
adventure
of
which
the
secret
i
like
to
put
it
so
perished
with
him
he
was
to
remember
as
i
perceived
later
on
many
things
that
i
did
impressions
i
sometimes
wished
as
with
a
retracing
jealousy
or
at
least
envy
that
i
might
also
have
fallen
direct
heir
to
but
he
professed
amazement
and
even
occasionally
impatience
at
my
reach
of
reminiscence
liking
as
he
did
to
brush
away
old
moral
scraps
in
favour
of
new
rather
than
to
hoard
and
so
complacently
exhibit
them
if
in
my
way
i
collected
the
new
as
well
i
yet
cherished
the
old
the
ragbag
of
memory
hung
on
its
nail
in
my
closet
though
i
learnt
with
time
to
control
the
habit
of
bringing
it
forth
and
i
say
that
with
a
due
sense
of
my
doubtless
now
appearing
to
empty
it
into
these
pages
i
keep
picking
out
at
hazard
those
passages
of
our
earliest
age
that
help
to
reconstruct
for
me
even
by
tiny
touches
the
experience
of
our
parents
any
shade
of
which
seems
somehow
to
signify
i
cherish
to
the
extent
of
here
reproducing
an
old
daguerreotype
all
the
circumstances
of
the
taking
of
which
i
intensely
recall
though
as
i
was
lately
turned
twelve
when
i
figured
for
it
the
feat
of
memory
is
perhaps
not
remarkable
it
documents
for
me
in
so
welcome
and
so
definite
a
manner
my
father
cultivation
of
my
company
it
documents
at
the
same
time
the
absurdest
little
legend
of
my
small
boyhood
the
romantic
tradition
of
the
value
of
being
taken
up
from
wherever
we
were
staying
to
the
queer
empty
dusty
smelly
new
york
of
midsummer
i
apply
that
last
term
because
we
always
arrived
by
boat
and
i
have
still
in
my
nostril
the
sense
of
the
of
the
hot
town
the
rank
and
rubbishy
waterside
quarters
where
big
loose
cobbles
for
the
least
of
all
the
base
items
lay
wrenched
from
their
sockets
of
pungent
black
mud
and
where
the
dependent
streets
managed
by
a
law
of
their
own
to
be
all
corners
and
the
corners
to
be
all
groceries
groceries
indeed
largely
of
the
green
order
so
far
as
greenness
could
persist
in
the
torrid
air
and
that
bristled
in
glorious
defiance
of
traffic
with
the
overflow
of
their
wares
and
implements
carts
and
barrows
and
boxes
and
baskets
sprawling
or
stacked
familiarly
elbowed
in
its
course
the
bumping
hack
the
comprehensive
carriage
of
other
days
the
only
vehicle
of
hire
then
known
to
us
while
the
situation
was
accepted
by
the
loose
citizen
in
the
garb
of
a
freeman
save
for
the
brass
star
on
his
breast
and
the
new
york
garb
of
the
period
was
as
i
remember
it
an
immense
attestation
of
liberty
why
the
throb
of
romance
should
have
beat
time
for
me
to
such
visions
i
can
scarce
explain
or
can
explain
only
by
the
fact
that
the
squalor
was
a
squalor
wonderfully
mixed
and
seasoned
and
that
i
should
wrong
the
whole
impression
if
i
did
figure
it
first
and
foremost
as
that
of
some
vast
succulent
cornucopia
what
did
the
stacked
boxes
and
baskets
of
our
youth
represent
but
the
boundless
fruitage
of
that
more
bucolic
age
of
the
american
world
and
what
was
after
all
of
so
strong
an
assault
as
the
rankness
of
such
a
harvest
where
is
that
fruitage
now
where
in
particular
are
the
peaches
where
the
mounds
of
isabella
grapes
and
seckel
pears
in
the
sticky
sweetness
of
which
our
childhood
seems
to
have
been
steeped
it
was
surely
save
perhaps
for
oranges
a
more
informally
and
familiarly
time
and
bushels
of
peaches
in
particular
peaches
big
and
peaches
small
peaches
white
and
peaches
yellow
played
a
part
in
life
from
which
they
have
somehow
been
deposed
every
garden
almost
every
bush
and
the
very
boys
pockets
grew
them
they
were
cut
up
and
eaten
with
cream
at
every
meal
domestically
brandied
they
figured
the
rest
of
the
year
scarce
less
freely
if
they
were
rather
a
party
dish
it
was
because
they
made
the
party
whenever
they
appeared
and
when
was
added
or
they
were
added
it
they
formed
the
highest
revel
we
knew
above
all
the
public
heaps
of
them
the
receptacles
at
every
turn
touched
the
street
as
with
a
sort
of
southern
plenty
the
note
of
the
rejected
and
scattered
fragments
the
memory
of
the
slippery
skins
and
rinds
and
kernels
with
which
the
old
dislocated
flags
were
bestrown
is
itself
endeared
to
me
and
contributes
a
further
pictorial
grace
we
ate
everything
in
those
days
by
the
bushel
and
the
barrel
as
from
stores
that
were
infinite
we
handled
watermelons
as
freely
as
cocoanuts
and
the
amount
of
involved
was
negligible
in
the
general
consciousness
the
glow
of
this
consciousness
even
in
so
small
an
organism
was
part
of
the
charm
of
these
retreats
offered
me
cityward
upon
our
base
of
provisions
a
part
of
the
rest
of
which
i
disengage
was
in
my
fond
perception
of
that
almost
eccentrically
habit
in
my
father
which
furnished
us
with
half
the
household
humour
of
our
childhood
besides
furnishing
with
any
quantity
of
extravagant
picture
of
his
so
prompt
pangs
of
anguish
in
absence
for
celebration
of
his
precipitate
returns
it
was
traditional
for
us
later
on
and
especially
on
the
european
scene
that
for
him
to
leave
us
in
pursuit
of
some
advantage
or
convenience
some
improvement
of
our
condition
some
enlargement
of
our
view
was
for
him
breathlessly
to
reappear
after
the
shortest
possible
interval
with
no
account
at
all
to
give
of
the
benefit
aimed
at
but
instead
of
this
a
moving
representation
a
far
richer
recital
of
his
spiritual
adventures
at
the
horrid
inhuman
inns
and
amid
the
hard
alien
races
which
had
stayed
his
advance
he
reacted
he
rebounded
in
favour
of
his
fireside
from
whatever
brief
explorations
or
curiosities
these
passionate
spontaneities
were
the
pulse
of
his
life
and
quite
some
of
the
principal
events
of
ours
and
as
he
was
nothing
if
not
expressive
whatever
happened
to
him
for
inward
intensity
happened
abundantly
to
us
for
pity
and
terror
as
it
were
as
well
as
for
an
ease
and
a
quality
of
amusement
among
ourselves
that
was
really
always
to
fail
us
among
others
comparatively
late
in
life
after
his
death
i
had
occasion
to
visit
in
lieu
of
my
brother
then
in
europe
an
american
city
in
which
he
had
had
since
his
own
death
interests
that
were
of
importance
to
us
all
on
my
asking
the
agent
in
charge
when
the
owner
had
last
taken
personal
cognisance
of
his
property
that
gentleman
replied
only
half
to
my
surprise
that
he
had
never
in
all
his
years
of
possession
performed
such
an
act
then
it
was
perhaps
that
i
most
took
the
measure
of
his
fine
faith
in
human
confidence
as
an
administrative
function
he
had
to
have
a
somehow
expressed
and
as
he
was
the
vividest
and
happiest
of
it
rarely
failed
of
coming
but
once
it
was
established
it
served
him
in
every
case
much
better
than
fussy
challenges
which
had
always
the
drawback
of
involving
lapses
and
inattentions
in
regard
to
solicitudes
more
pressing
he
incurably
took
for
granted
incurably
because
whenever
he
did
so
the
process
succeeded
with
which
association
however
i
perhaps
overdrench
my
complacent
vision
of
our
summer
snatches
at
town
through
a
grave
accident
in
early
life
country
walks
on
rough
roads
were
in
spite
of
his
great
constitutional
soundness
tedious
and
charmless
to
him
he
liked
on
the
other
hand
the
peopled
pavement
the
thought
of
which
made
him
restless
when
away
hence
the
fidelities
and
sociabilities
however
superficial
that
he
could
reaffirm
if
he
could
only
reaffirm
the
others
the
really
intimate
and
still
more
communicable
soon
enough
afterwards
it
was
these
of
the
improvised
and
casual
sort
that
i
shared
with
him
thus
indelibly
for
truly
if
we
took
the
boat
to
town
to
do
things
i
did
them
quite
as
much
as
he
and
so
that
a
little
boy
could
scarce
have
done
them
more
my
part
may
indeed
but
have
been
to
surround
his
part
with
a
thick
imaginative
aura
but
that
constituted
for
me
an
activity
than
which
i
could
dream
of
none
braver
or
wilder
we
went
to
the
office
of
the
new
york
tribune
my
father
relations
with
that
journal
were
actual
and
close
and
that
was
a
wonderful
world
indeed
with
strange
steepnesses
and
machineries
and
noises
and
hurrying
men
and
amid
the
agitation
clever
easy
kindly
jocular
partly
undressed
gentlemen
it
was
always
july
or
august
some
of
whom
i
knew
at
home
taking
it
all
as
if
it
were
the
most
natural
place
in
the
world
it
was
big
to
me
big
to
me
with
the
breath
of
great
vague
connections
and
i
supposed
the
gentlemen
very
old
though
since
aware
that
they
must
have
been
for
the
connections
remarkably
young
and
the
conversation
of
one
of
them
the
one
i
saw
oftenest
up
town
who
attained
to
great
local
and
to
considerable
national
eminence
afterwards
and
who
talked
often
and
thrillingly
about
the
theatres
i
retain
as
many
bright
fragments
of
as
if
i
had
been
another
little
boswell
it
was
as
if
he
had
dropped
into
my
mind
the
germ
of
certain
interests
that
were
long
afterwards
to
flower
as
for
instance
on
his
announcing
the
receipt
from
paris
of
news
of
the
appearance
at
the
théâtre
français
of
an
actress
madame
judith
who
was
formidably
to
compete
with
her
coreligionary
rachel
and
to
endanger
that
laurels
why
should
madame
judith
name
have
stuck
to
me
through
all
the
years
since
i
was
never
to
see
her
and
she
is
as
forgotten
as
rachel
is
remembered
why
should
that
scrap
of
gossip
have
made
a
date
for
my
consciousness
turning
it
to
the
comédie
with
an
intensity
that
was
long
afterwards
to
culminate
why
was
it
equally
to
abide
for
me
that
the
same
gentleman
had
on
one
of
these
occasions
mentioned
his
having
just
come
back
from
a
wonderful
city
of
the
west
chicago
which
though
but
a
year
or
two
old
with
plank
sidewalks
when
there
were
any
and
holes
and
humps
where
there
were
none
and
shanties
where
there
were
not
big
blocks
and
everything
where
there
had
yesterday
been
nothing
had
already
developed
a
huge
energy
and
curiosity
and
also
an
appetite
for
lectures
i
became
aware
of
the
comédie
i
became
aware
of
chicago
i
also
became
aware
that
even
the
most
alluring
fiction
was
not
always
for
little
boys
to
read
it
was
mentioned
at
the
tribune
office
that
one
of
its
reporters
solon
robinson
had
put
forth
a
novel
rather
oddly
entitled
hot
corn
and
more
or
less
having
for
its
subject
the
career
of
a
little
girl
who
hawked
that
familiar
american
luxury
in
the
streets
the
volume
i
think
was
put
into
my
father
hand
and
i
recall
my
prompt
desire
to
make
acquaintance
with
it
no
less
than
the
remark
as
promptly
addressed
to
my
companion
that
the
work
however
engaging
was
not
one
that
should
be
left
accessible
to
an
innocent
child
the
pang
occasioned
by
this
warning
has
scarcely
yet
died
out
for
me
nor
my
sense
of
my
first
wonder
at
the
discrimination
so
great
became
from
that
moment
the
mystery
of
the
tabooed
book
of
whatever
identity
the
question
in
my
breast
of
why
if
it
was
to
be
so
right
for
others
it
was
only
to
be
wrong
for
me
i
remember
the
soreness
of
the
thought
that
it
was
i
rather
who
was
wrong
for
the
book
which
was
somehow
humiliating
in
that
amount
of
discredit
one
could
but
be
involved
neither
then
nor
afterwards
was
the
secret
of
hot
corn
revealed
to
me
and
the
sense
of
privation
was
to
be
more
prolonged
i
fear
than
the
vogue
of
the
tale
which
even
as
a
success
of
scandal
could
have
been
great
vii
dimly
queer
and
pathetic
to
me
were
to
remain
through
much
of
the
after
time
indeed
most
of
those
early
indigenous
vogues
and
literary
flurries
so
few
of
those
that
brushed
by
my
childhood
had
been
other
than
a
tinkling
that
suddenly
stopped
i
am
afraid
i
mean
that
what
was
touching
was
rather
the
fact
that
the
tinkle
penetrate
than
the
fact
that
it
died
away
the
light
of
criticism
might
have
beat
so
straight
if
the
sense
of
proportion
and
the
fact
of
compassion
waved
it
away
on
the
æsthetic
phase
during
which
the
appeal
was
mainly
the
tinkle
the
scarlet
letter
and
the
seven
gables
had
the
deep
tone
as
much
as
one
would
but
of
the
current
efforts
of
the
imagination
they
were
alone
in
having
it
till
walt
whitman
broke
out
in
the
later
fifties
and
i
was
to
know
nothing
of
that
happy
genius
till
long
after
an
absorbed
perusal
of
the
lamplighter
was
what
i
was
to
achieve
at
the
fleeting
hour
i
continue
to
circle
round
that
romance
was
on
every
one
lips
and
i
recollect
it
as
more
or
less
thrust
upon
me
in
amends
for
the
imposed
sacrifice
of
a
ranker
actuality
that
of
the
improper
robinson
i
mean
as
to
whom
there
revives
in
me
the
main
question
of
where
his
impropriety
in
so
general
a
platitude
of
the
bourgeois
could
possibly
have
dwelt
it
was
to
be
true
indeed
that
walt
whitman
achieved
an
impropriety
of
the
first
magnitude
that
success
however
but
showed
us
the
platitude
returning
in
a
genial
rage
upon
itself
and
getting
out
of
control
by
generic
excess
there
was
no
rage
at
any
rate
in
the
lamplighter
over
which
i
fondly
hung
and
which
would
have
been
my
first
novel
it
had
been
soothingly
offered
me
for
that
had
i
consented
to
take
it
as
really
and
truly
i
could
have
said
what
it
lacked
for
the
character
i
only
had
my
secret
reserves
and
when
one
blest
afternoon
on
the
new
brighton
boat
i
waded
into
the
initials
i
saw
how
right
i
had
been
the
initials
and
the
difference
thereby
exquisite
it
came
over
me
with
the
very
first
page
assimilated
in
the
fluttered
little
cabin
to
which
i
had
retired
with
it
all
in
spite
of
the
fact
too
that
my
attention
was
distracted
by
a
pair
of
remarkable
little
girls
who
lurked
there
out
of
more
public
view
as
to
hint
that
they
were
to
be
seen
for
nothing
that
must
have
been
a
rich
hour
for
i
mix
the
marvel
of
the
boon
children
strange
pale
little
flowers
of
the
american
theatre
with
my
conscious
joy
in
bringing
back
to
my
mother
from
our
forage
in
new
york
a
gift
of
such
happy
promise
as
the
history
of
the
hamilton
and
his
two
bavarian
beauties
the
elder
of
whom
hildegarde
was
to
figure
for
our
small
generation
as
the
very
type
of
the
haughty
as
distinguished
from
the
forward
heroine
since
i
think
our
categories
really
came
to
no
more
than
those
i
could
have
got
very
far
with
hildegarde
in
moments
so
scant
but
i
memorably
felt
that
romance
was
thick
round
me
everything
at
such
a
crisis
seeming
to
make
for
it
at
once
the
boon
children
conveyed
thus
to
new
brighton
under
care
of
a
lady
in
whose
aspect
the
strain
of
the
resolute
triumphed
over
the
note
of
the
battered
though
the
showy
in
it
rather
succumbed
at
the
same
time
to
the
dowdy
were
already
billed
as
infant
phenomena
for
a
performance
that
night
at
the
pavilion
where
our
attendance
it
was
a
shock
to
feel
could
be
promised
and
in
gazing
without
charge
at
the
pair
of
weary
and
sleepy
little
mountebanks
i
found
the
histrionic
character
and
the
dramatic
profession
for
the
first
time
revealed
to
me
they
filled
me
with
fascination
and
yet
with
fear
they
expressed
a
melancholy
grace
and
a
sort
of
peevish
refinement
yet
seemed
awfully
detached
and
indifferent
indifferent
perhaps
even
to
being
pinched
and
slapped
for
art
sake
at
home
they
honoured
me
with
no
notice
whatever
and
regarded
me
doubtless
as
no
better
than
one
of
the
little
louts
peeping
through
the
tent
of
the
show
in
return
i
judged
their
appearance
dissipated
though
fascinating
and
sought
consolation
for
the
memory
of
their
scorn
and
the
loss
of
their
exhibition
as
time
went
on
in
noting
that
the
bounds
of
their
fame
seemed
somehow
to
have
been
stayed
i
neither
met
them
nor
heard
of
them
again
the
little
batemans
must
have
obscured
their
comparatively
dim
lustre
flourishing
at
the
same
period
and
with
a
larger
command
of
the
pictorial
poster
and
the
other
primitive
symbols
in
broadway
such
posters
and
such
symbols
as
they
were
at
that
time
the
little
batemans
who
were
to
be
reserved
in
maturer
form
for
my
much
later
and
more
grateful
appreciation
this
weak
reminiscence
has
obstructed
however
something
more
to
the
purpose
the
retained
impression
of
those
choicest
of
our
loiterings
that
took
place
still
far
at
the
bookstore
home
of
delights
and
haunt
of
fancy
it
was
at
the
bookstore
we
had
called
on
the
day
of
the
initials
and
the
boon
children
and
it
was
thence
we
were
returning
with
our
spoil
of
which
the
charming
novel
must
have
been
but
a
fragment
my
impression
composed
itself
of
many
pieces
a
great
and
various
practice
of
burying
my
nose
in
the
book
for
the
strong
smell
of
paper
and
printer
ink
known
to
us
as
the
english
smell
was
needed
to
account
for
it
was
the
exercise
of
the
finest
sense
that
hung
about
us
my
brother
and
me
or
of
one
at
least
but
little
less
fine
than
the
sense
for
the
satisfaction
of
which
we
resorted
to
thompson
and
to
taylor
it
bore
me
company
during
all
our
returns
from
forages
and
left
me
persuaded
that
i
had
only
to
snuff
up
hard
enough
fresh
uncut
volume
in
hand
to
taste
of
the
very
substance
of
london
all
our
books
in
that
age
were
english
at
least
all
our
ones
i
personally
recall
scarce
any
that
were
not
and
i
take
the
perception
of
that
quality
in
them
to
have
associated
itself
with
more
fond
dreams
and
glimmering
pictures
than
any
other
one
principle
of
growth
it
was
all
a
result
of
the
deeply
state
i
had
been
prematurely
poisoned
as
i
shall
presently
explain
the
bookstore
fondest
of
my
father
resorts
though
i
remember
no
more
of
its
public
identity
than
that
it
further
enriched
the
brave
depth
of
broadway
was
overwhelmingly
and
irresistibly
english
as
not
less
tonically
english
was
our
principal
host
there
with
whom
we
had
moreover
my
father
and
i
thanks
to
his
office
such
personal
and
genial
relations
that
i
recall
seeing
him
grace
our
board
at
home
in
company
with
his
wife
whose
vocal
strain
and
complexion
and
coiffure
and
flounces
i
found
none
the
less
informing
none
the
less
racial
for
my
not
being
then
versed
in
the
language
of
analysis
the
true
inwardness
of
these
rich
meanings
those
above
all
of
the
bookstore
itself
was
that
a
tradition
was
thus
fed
a
presumption
thus
created
a
vague
vision
thus
filled
in
all
expression
is
clumsy
for
so
mystic
a
process
what
else
can
have
happened
but
that
having
taken
over
under
suggestion
and
with
singular
infant
promptitude
a
particular
throbbing
consciousness
i
had
become
aware
of
the
source
at
which
it
could
best
be
refreshed
that
consciousness
so
communicated
was
just
simply
of
certain
impressions
certain
of
impression
again
proceeding
from
over
the
sea
and
situated
beyond
it
or
even
much
rather
of
my
parents
own
impression
of
such
the
fruit
of
a
happy
time
spent
in
and
about
london
with
their
two
babies
and
reflected
in
that
portion
of
their
talk
with
each
other
to
which
i
best
attended
had
their
talk
for
its
subject
in
my
infant
ears
that
happy
time
did
it
deal
only
with
london
and
piccadilly
and
the
green
park
where
over
against
their
dwelling
their
two
babies
mainly
took
the
air
under
charge
of
fanny
of
albany
their
american
nurse
whose
remark
as
to
the
degree
to
which
the
british
museum
fell
short
for
one
who
had
had
the
privilege
of
that
of
albany
was
handed
down
to
us
did
it
never
forbear
from
windsor
and
richmond
and
sudbrook
and
ham
common
amid
the
rich
complexity
of
which
crowding
their
discourse
with
echoes
they
had
spent
their
summer
all
a
scattering
of
such
pearls
as
it
seemed
that
their
could
most
deftly
and
instinctively
pick
up
our
sole
maternal
aunt
already
mentioned
as
a
devoted
and
cherished
presence
during
those
and
many
later
years
was
in
a
position
to
share
with
them
the
treasure
of
these
mild
memories
which
strike
me
as
having
for
the
most
part
through
some
bright
household
habit
overflowed
at
the
where
i
regularly
attended
with
she
had
imbibed
betimes
in
europe
the
seeds
of
a
long
nostalgia
and
i
think
of
her
as
ever
so
patiently
communicative
on
that
score
under
pressure
of
my
artless
appeal
that
i
should
have
been
so
inquiring
while
still
so
destitute
of
primary
data
was
doubtless
rather
an
anomaly
and
it
was
for
that
matter
quite
as
if
my
infant
divination
proceeded
by
the
light
of
nature
i
divined
that
it
would
matter
to
me
in
the
future
that
english
life
should
be
of
this
or
that
fashion
my
father
had
subscribed
for
me
to
a
small
periodical
of
quarto
form
covered
in
yellow
and
entitled
the
charm
which
shed
on
the
question
the
softest
lustre
but
of
which
the
appearances
were
sadly
intermittent
or
then
struck
me
as
being
inasmuch
as
many
of
our
visits
to
the
bookstore
were
to
ask
for
the
new
number
only
to
learn
with
painful
frequency
that
the
last
consignment
from
london
had
arrived
without
it
i
feel
again
the
pang
of
that
disappointment
as
if
through
the
want
of
what
i
needed
most
for
going
on
the
english
smell
was
exhaled
by
the
charm
in
a
peculiar
degree
and
i
see
myself
affected
by
the
failure
as
by
that
of
a
vital
tonic
it
was
not
at
the
same
time
by
a
charm
the
more
or
the
less
that
my
salvation
was
to
be
as
it
were
worked
out
or
my
imagination
at
any
rate
duly
convinced
conviction
was
the
result
of
the
very
air
of
home
so
far
as
i
most
consciously
inhaled
it
this
represented
no
doubt
a
failure
to
read
into
matters
close
at
hand
all
the
interest
they
were
capable
of
yielding
but
i
had
taken
the
twist
had
sipped
the
poison
as
i
say
and
was
to
feel
it
to
that
end
the
most
salutary
cup
i
saw
my
parents
homesick
as
i
conceived
for
the
ancient
order
and
distressed
and
inconvenienced
by
many
of
the
more
immediate
features
of
the
modern
as
the
modern
pressed
upon
us
and
since
their
theory
of
our
better
living
was
from
an
early
time
that
we
should
renew
the
quest
of
the
ancient
on
the
very
first
possibility
i
simply
grew
greater
in
the
faith
that
somehow
to
manage
that
would
constitute
success
in
life
i
never
found
myself
deterred
from
this
fond
view
which
was
implied
in
every
question
i
asked
every
answer
i
got
and
every
plan
i
formed
those
are
great
words
for
the
daydream
of
infant
ignorance
yet
if
success
in
life
may
perhaps
be
best
defined
as
the
performance
in
age
of
some
intention
arrested
in
youth
i
may
frankly
put
in
a
claim
to
it
to
press
my
nose
against
the
sources
of
the
english
smell
so
different
for
young
bibliophiles
from
any
american
was
to
adopt
that
sweetness
as
the
sign
of
my
atmosphere
roundabout
might
be
the
course
to
take
but
one
was
in
motion
from
the
first
and
one
never
lost
sight
of
the
goal
the
very
names
of
places
and
things
in
the
other
world
the
marked
opposite
in
most
ways
of
that
in
which
new
york
and
albany
fort
hamilton
and
new
brighton
formed
so
fallacious
a
maximum
became
to
me
values
and
secrets
and
shibboleths
they
were
probably
often
on
my
tongue
and
employed
as
ignorance
determined
but
i
quite
recall
being
ashamed
to
use
them
as
much
as
i
should
have
liked
it
was
new
brighton
i
reconstruct
and
indeed
definitely
remember
that
finished
us
at
last
that
and
our
final
sordid
school
w
j
and
mine
in
new
york
the
ancient
order
somehow
to
be
invoked
when
such
advantages
as
those
were
the
best
within
our
compass
and
our
means
not
further
to
anticipate
at
all
events
that
climax
was
for
a
while
but
vaguely
in
sight
and
the
illusion
of
felicity
continued
from
season
to
season
to
shut
us
in
it
is
only
of
what
i
took
for
felicity
however
few
the
years
and
however
scant
the
scene
that
i
am
pretending
now
to
speak
though
i
shall
have
strained
the
last
drop
of
romance
from
this
vision
of
our
towny
summers
with
the
quite
sharp
reminiscence
of
my
first
sitting
for
my
daguerreotype
i
repaired
with
my
father
on
an
august
day
to
the
great
broadway
establishment
of
brady
supreme
in
that
then
beautiful
art
and
it
is
my
impression
the
only
point
vague
with
me
that
though
we
had
come
up
by
the
staten
island
boat
for
the
purpose
we
were
to
keep
the
affair
secret
till
the
charming
consequence
should
break
at
home
upon
my
mother
strong
is
my
conviction
that
our
mystery
in
the
event
yielded
almost
at
once
to
our
elation
for
no
tradition
had
a
brighter
household
life
with
us
than
that
of
our
father
headlong
impatience
he
moved
in
a
cloud
if
not
rather
in
a
high
radiance
of
precipitation
and
divulgation
a
chartered
rebel
against
cold
reserves
the
good
news
in
his
hand
refused
under
any
persuasion
to
grow
stale
the
sense
of
communicable
pleasure
in
his
breast
was
positively
explosive
so
that
we
saw
those
surprises
in
which
he
had
conspired
with
our
mother
for
our
benefit
converted
by
him
in
every
case
under
our
shamelessly
encouraged
guesses
into
common
conspiracies
against
her
against
her
knowing
that
is
how
thoroughly
we
were
all
compromised
he
had
a
special
and
delightful
sophistry
at
the
service
of
his
overflow
and
never
so
fine
a
fancy
as
in
defending
it
on
human
grounds
he
was
something
very
different
withal
from
a
parent
of
weak
mercies
weakness
was
never
so
positive
and
plausible
nor
could
the
attitude
of
sparing
you
be
more
handsomely
or
on
occasion
even
more
comically
aggressive
my
small
point
is
simply
however
that
the
secresy
of
our
conjoined
portrait
was
probably
very
soon
by
his
act
to
begin
a
public
and
shining
life
and
to
enjoy
it
till
we
received
the
picture
as
to
which
moreover
still
another
remembrance
steals
on
me
a
proof
of
the
fact
that
our
adventure
was
improvised
sharp
again
is
my
sense
of
not
being
so
adequately
dressed
as
i
should
have
taken
thought
for
had
i
foreseen
my
exposure
though
the
resources
of
my
wardrobe
as
then
constituted
could
surely
have
left
me
but
few
alternatives
the
main
resource
of
a
small
new
york
boy
in
this
line
at
that
time
was
the
little
jacket
tight
to
the
body
closed
at
the
neck
and
adorned
in
front
with
a
single
row
of
brass
buttons
a
garment
of
scant
grace
assuredly
and
compromised
to
my
consciousness
above
all
by
a
strange
ironic
light
from
an
unforgotten
source
it
was
but
a
short
time
before
those
days
that
the
great
thackeray
had
come
to
america
to
lecture
on
the
english
humourists
and
still
present
to
me
is
the
voice
proceeding
from
my
father
library
in
which
some
glimpse
of
me
hovering
at
an
opening
of
the
door
in
passage
or
on
staircase
prompted
him
to
the
formidable
words
come
here
little
boy
and
show
me
your
extraordinary
jacket
my
sense
of
my
jacket
became
from
that
hour
a
heavy
one
further
enriched
as
my
vision
is
by
my
shyness
of
posture
before
the
seated
the
celebrated
visitor
who
struck
me
in
the
sunny
light
of
the
animated
room
as
enormously
big
and
who
though
he
laid
on
my
shoulder
the
hand
of
benevolence
bent
on
my
native
costume
the
spectacles
of
wonder
i
was
to
know
later
on
why
he
had
been
so
amused
and
why
after
asking
me
if
this
were
the
common
uniform
of
my
age
and
class
he
remarked
that
in
england
were
i
to
go
there
i
should
be
addressed
as
buttons
it
had
been
revealed
to
me
thus
in
a
flash
that
we
were
somehow
and
though
never
exactly
crushed
by
it
i
became
aware
that
i
at
least
felt
so
as
i
stood
with
my
head
in
brady
vise
beautiful
most
decidedly
the
lost
art
of
the
daguerreotype
i
remember
the
exposure
as
on
this
occasion
interminably
long
yet
with
the
result
of
a
facial
anguish
far
less
harshly
reproduced
than
my
suffered
snapshots
of
a
later
age
too
few
i
may
here
interject
were
to
remain
my
gathered
impressions
of
the
great
humourist
but
one
of
them
indeed
almost
the
only
other
bears
again
on
the
play
of
his
humour
over
our
perversities
of
dress
it
belongs
to
a
later
moment
an
occasion
on
which
i
see
him
familiarly
seated
with
us
in
paris
during
the
spring
of
at
some
repast
at
which
the
younger
of
us
too
by
that
time
habitually
flocked
in
our
affluence
of
five
our
youngest
was
beside
him
a
small
sister
then
not
quite
in
her
eighth
year
and
arrayed
apparently
after
the
fashion
of
the
period
and
place
and
the
tradition
lingered
long
of
his
having
suddenly
laid
his
hand
on
her
little
flounced
person
and
exclaimed
with
ludicrous
horror
crinoline
i
was
suspecting
it
so
young
and
so
depraved
a
fainter
image
that
of
one
of
the
new
york
moments
just
eludes
me
pursue
it
as
i
will
i
recover
but
the
setting
and
the
fact
of
his
brief
presence
in
it
with
nothing
that
was
said
or
done
beyond
my
being
left
with
my
father
to
watch
our
distinguished
friend
secretary
who
was
also
a
young
artist
establish
his
easel
and
proceed
to
paint
the
setting
as
i
recall
it
was
an
odd
oblong
blank
private
parlour
at
the
clarendon
hotel
then
the
latest
thing
in
hotels
but
whose
ancient
corner
of
fourth
avenue
and
was
it
eighteenth
street
long
ago
ceased
to
know
it
the
gentle
very
gentle
portraitist
was
eyre
crowe
and
the
obliging
sitter
my
father
who
sat
in
response
to
desire
that
his
protégé
should
find
employment
the
protector
after
a
little
departed
blessing
the
business
which
took
the
form
of
a
small
of
the
model
seated
his
arm
extended
and
the
hand
on
the
knob
of
his
cane
the
work
it
may
at
this
time
of
day
be
mentioned
fell
below
its
general
possibilities
but
i
note
the
scene
through
which
i
must
duly
have
gaped
and
wondered
for
i
had
as
yet
seen
no
one
least
of
all
a
casual
acquaintance
in
an
hotel
parlour
really
paint
before
as
a
happy
example
again
of
my
parent
positive
cultivation
of
my
society
it
would
seem
and
thought
for
my
social
education
and
then
there
are
other
connections
i
recall
it
as
a
sunday
morning
i
recover
the
place
itself
as
a
featureless
void
bleak
and
bare
with
its
developments
all
to
come
the
hotel
parlour
of
other
new
york
days
but
vivid
still
to
me
is
my
conscious
assistance
for
the
first
time
at
operations
that
were
to
mean
much
for
many
of
my
coming
years
those
of
quiet
crowe
held
me
spellbound
i
was
to
circle
so
wistfully
as
from
that
beginning
round
the
practice
of
his
art
which
in
spite
of
these
earnest
approaches
and
intentions
never
on
its
own
part
in
the
least
acknowledged
our
acquaintance
scarcely
much
more
than
it
was
ever
to
respond
for
that
matter
to
the
overtures
of
the
mild
aspirant
himself
known
to
my
observation
long
afterwards
in
the
london
years
as
the
most
touchingly
resigned
of
the
children
of
disappointment
not
only
by
association
was
he
a
thackerayan
figure
but
much
as
if
the
master
hand
had
stamped
him
with
the
outline
and
the
value
with
life
and
sweetness
and
patience
shown
as
after
the
long
futility
seated
in
a
quiet
wait
very
long
too
for
the
end
that
was
sad
one
but
feel
yet
it
was
in
the
oddest
way
impossible
to
take
him
for
a
failure
he
might
have
been
one
of
fortune
strictly
but
what
was
that
when
he
was
one
of
thackeray
own
successes
in
the
minor
line
but
with
such
a
grace
and
such
a
truth
those
of
some
dim
second
cousin
to
colonel
newcome
viii
i
feel
that
at
such
a
rate
i
remember
too
much
and
yet
this
mild
apparitionism
is
only
part
of
it
to
look
back
at
all
is
to
meet
the
apparitional
and
to
find
in
its
ghostly
face
the
silent
stare
of
an
appeal
when
i
fix
it
the
hovering
shade
whether
of
person
or
place
it
fixes
me
back
and
seems
the
less
lost
not
to
my
consciousness
for
that
is
nothing
but
to
its
own
by
my
stopping
however
idly
for
it
the
day
of
the
daguerreotype
the
august
afternoon
what
was
it
if
not
one
of
the
days
when
we
went
to
union
square
for
luncheon
and
for
more
and
more
peaches
and
even
more
even
most
enjoyment
of
ease
accompanied
by
stimulation
of
wonder
it
may
have
been
indeed
that
a
visit
to
cannon
rather
on
that
occasion
engaged
us
memory
selects
a
little
confusedly
from
such
a
wealth
of
experience
for
the
wonder
was
the
experience
and
that
was
everywhere
even
if
i
did
so
much
find
it
as
take
it
with
me
to
be
sure
of
not
falling
short
cannon
lurked
near
fourth
street
i
abundantly
grasp
not
more
definitely
placing
her
than
in
what
seemed
to
me
a
labyrinth
of
grave
westwardly
back
of
broadway
yet
at
no
great
distance
from
it
where
she
must
have
occupied
a
house
at
a
corner
since
we
reached
her
not
by
steps
that
went
up
to
a
front
door
but
by
others
that
went
slightly
down
and
formed
clearly
an
independent
side
access
a
feature
that
affected
me
as
rich
and
strange
what
the
steps
went
down
to
was
a
spacious
room
light
and
friendly
so
that
it
could
have
been
compromised
by
an
area
which
offered
the
brave
mystification
amid
other
mystifications
of
being
at
once
a
parlour
and
a
shop
a
shop
in
particular
for
the
relief
of
gentlemen
in
want
of
pockethandkerchiefs
neckties
collars
umbrellas
and
bottles
of
the
essence
known
in
old
new
york
as
cullone
with
a
very
long
and
big
cannon
was
always
seated
at
some
delicate
white
or
other
needlework
as
if
she
herself
made
the
collars
and
the
neckties
and
hemmed
the
pockethandkerchiefs
though
the
air
of
this
conflicts
with
the
sense
of
importation
from
remoter
centres
of
fashion
breathed
by
some
of
the
more
thrilling
of
the
remarks
i
heard
exchanged
at
the
same
time
that
it
quickened
the
oddity
of
the
place
for
the
oddity
was
in
many
things
above
all
perhaps
in
there
being
no
counter
no
rows
of
shelves
and
no
vulgar
till
for
cannon
commerce
the
parlour
clearly
dissimulated
the
shop
and
positively
to
that
extent
that
i
might
uncannily
have
wondered
what
the
shop
dissimulated
it
represented
honestly
i
made
out
in
the
course
of
visits
that
seem
to
me
to
have
been
delightfully
repeated
the
more
informal
of
the
approaches
to
our
friend
brave
background
or
hinterland
the
realm
of
her
main
industry
the
array
of
the
furnished
apartments
for
gentlemen
gentlemen
largely
for
whom
she
imported
the
eau
de
cologne
and
the
neckties
and
who
struck
me
as
principally
consisting
of
the
ever
remarkable
uncles
desirous
at
times
on
their
restless
returns
from
albany
or
wherever
of
an
intimacy
of
comfort
that
the
new
york
hotel
could
yield
fascinating
thus
the
implications
of
establishment
where
the
talk
took
the
turn
in
particular
of
john
and
edward
and
howard
and
where
miss
maggie
or
miss
susie
who
were
on
the
spot
in
other
rocking
chairs
and
with
other
poised
needles
made
their
points
as
well
as
the
rest
of
us
the
interest
of
the
place
was
that
the
uncles
were
somehow
always
under
discussion
as
to
where
they
at
the
moment
might
be
or
as
to
when
they
were
expected
or
above
all
as
to
how
the
how
was
the
great
matter
and
the
fine
emphasis
they
had
last
appeared
and
might
be
conceived
as
carrying
themselves
and
that
their
consumption
of
neckties
and
eau
de
cologne
was
somehow
inordinate
i
might
have
been
judging
it
in
my
innocence
as
their
only
i
refer
to
those
sources
i
say
the
charm
of
the
scene
the
finer
part
of
which
must
yet
have
been
that
it
did
as
it
regularly
lapsed
dispose
of
mystifications
if
i
understand
however
the
beauty
was
that
cannon
understood
that
was
what
she
did
most
of
all
even
more
than
hem
pockethandkerchiefs
and
collars
and
my
father
understood
and
each
understood
that
the
other
did
miss
maggie
and
miss
susie
being
no
whit
behind
it
was
only
i
who
did
understand
save
in
so
far
as
i
understood
which
was
a
kind
of
pale
joy
and
meanwhile
there
would
be
more
to
come
from
uncles
so
attachingly
so
almost
portentously
discussable
the
vision
at
any
rate
was
to
stick
by
me
as
through
its
friendly
grace
its
light
on
the
elder
amenity
the
prettier
manners
the
tender
personal
note
in
the
good
lady
importations
and
anxieties
that
of
the
fabric
and
the
discriminating
service
fit
to
figure
as
a
value
anywhere
by
which
i
meant
in
the
right
corner
of
any
social
picture
i
afterwards
said
to
myself
that
refined
and
composed
significance
of
cannon
scene
union
square
was
a
different
matter
though
with
the
element
there
also
that
i
made
out
that
i
make
out
my
sense
of
drama
was
in
this
case
i
think
rather
more
frightened
off
than
led
on
a
drawback
for
which
however
i
consoled
myself
by
baked
apples
and
custards
an
inveterate
feature
of
our
sunday
luncheon
there
those
of
weekdays
being
various
and
casual
and
by
a
study
of
a
great
store
as
it
seemed
to
me
of
volumes
devoted
mainly
to
the
heroines
of
romance
with
one
in
particular
presenting
those
of
shakespeare
in
which
the
plates
were
so
artfully
coloured
and
varnished
and
complexion
and
dress
thereby
so
endeared
to
memory
that
it
was
for
long
afterwards
a
shock
to
me
at
the
theatre
not
to
see
just
those
bright
images
with
their
peculiar
toggeries
come
on
i
was
able
but
the
other
day
moreover
to
renew
almost
on
the
very
spot
the
continuity
of
contemplation
large
lumpish
presences
precarious
creations
of
a
day
seemed
to
have
elbowed
out
of
the
square
all
but
one
or
two
of
the
minor
monuments
pleasant
appreciable
things
of
the
other
time
yet
close
to
university
place
the
old
house
of
the
and
the
custards
and
the
domestic
situation
had
though
disfigured
and
overscored
not
quite
received
its
i
disengaged
by
a
mere
identification
of
obscured
window
and
profaned
portico
a
whole
chapter
of
history
which
fact
should
indeed
be
a
warning
to
penetration
a
practical
plea
here
for
the
superficial
by
its
exhibition
of
the
rate
at
which
the
relations
of
any
gage
of
experience
multiply
and
ramify
from
the
moment
the
mind
begins
to
handle
it
i
pursued
a
swarm
of
such
relations
on
the
occasion
i
speak
of
up
and
down
west
fourteenth
street
and
over
to
seventh
avenue
running
most
of
them
to
earth
with
difficulty
but
finding
them
at
half
a
dozen
points
quite
confess
to
a
queer
stale
sameness
the
gage
of
experience
as
i
say
had
in
these
cases
been
strangely
spared
the
sameness
had
in
two
or
three
of
them
held
out
as
with
conscious
craft
but
these
are
impressions
i
shall
presently
find
it
impossible
not
to
take
up
again
at
any
cost
i
first
realised
fourteenth
street
at
a
very
tender
age
and
i
perfectly
recall
that
flush
of
initiation
consisting
as
it
did
of
an
afternoon
call
with
my
father
at
a
house
there
situated
one
of
an
already
fairly
mature
row
on
the
south
side
and
quite
near
sixth
avenue
it
was
as
our
house
just
acquired
by
us
that
he
thus
invited
my
approval
of
it
heaping
as
that
does
once
more
the
measure
of
my
small
adhesiveness
i
thoroughly
approved
quite
as
if
i
had
foreseen
that
the
place
was
to
become
to
me
for
ever
so
long
afterwards
a
sort
of
anchorage
of
the
spirit
being
at
the
hour
as
well
a
fascination
for
the
eyes
since
it
was
there
i
first
fondly
gaped
at
the
process
of
decorating
i
saw
charming
men
in
little
caps
ingeniously
formed
of
folded
newspaper
where
in
the
roaring
city
are
those
quaint
badges
of
the
handicrafts
now
mounted
on
platforms
and
casting
plaster
into
moulds
i
saw
them
in
particular
paste
long
strips
of
yellowish
grained
paper
upon
walls
and
i
vividly
remember
thinking
the
grain
and
the
pattern
for
there
was
a
pattern
from
down
a
complication
of
dragons
and
sphinxes
and
scrolls
and
other
fine
flourishes
a
wonderful
and
sumptuous
thing
i
would
give
much
i
protest
to
recover
its
lost
secret
to
see
what
it
really
was
so
interesting
ever
to
retrace
and
sometimes
so
difficult
of
belief
in
a
community
of
one
own
knowing
is
the
general
æsthetic
adventure
are
the
dangers
and
delusions
the
all
but
fatal
accidents
and
mortal
ailments
that
taste
has
smilingly
survived
and
after
which
the
fickle
creature
may
still
quite
brazenly
look
one
in
the
face
our
quarter
must
have
bristled
in
those
years
with
the
very
worst
of
the
though
indeed
they
figured
but
as
coarse
complacencies
the
age
of
brown
stone
had
just
been
ushered
in
and
that
material
in
deplorable
in
monstrous
form
over
all
the
vacant
spaces
and
eligible
sites
then
numerous
between
the
fifth
and
sixth
avenues
more
and
more
affronted
the
day
we
seemed
to
have
come
up
from
a
world
of
quieter
harmonies
the
world
of
washington
square
and
thereabouts
so
decent
in
its
dignity
so
instinctively
unpretentious
there
were
even
there
spots
of
shabbiness
that
i
recall
such
as
the
charmless
void
reaching
westward
from
the
two
houses
that
formed
the
fifth
avenue
corner
to
our
grandfather
our
new
york
house
itself
built
by
him
with
the
happiest
judgment
not
so
long
before
and
at
no
distant
time
in
truth
to
be
solidly
but
much
less
pleasingly
neighboured
the
ancient
name
of
the
still
hung
about
the
central
space
and
the
ancient
wooden
palings
then
so
generally
accounted
proper
for
central
spaces
the
whole
image
infinitely
recedes
affected
even
my
innocent
childhood
as
rustic
and
mean
union
square
at
the
top
of
the
avenue
or
what
practically
then
counted
for
the
top
was
encased
more
smartly
in
iron
rails
and
further
adorned
with
a
fountain
and
an
aged
constable
awful
to
my
generation
in
virtue
of
his
star
and
his
switch
i
associate
less
elegance
with
the
into
which
we
turned
for
recreation
from
my
neighbouring
and
where
the
parades
deployed
on
no
scale
to
check
our
own
evolutions
though
indeed
the
switch
of
office
abounded
there
for
what
i
best
recover
in
the
connection
is
a
sense
and
smell
of
perpetual
autumn
with
the
ground
so
muffled
in
the
leaves
and
twigs
of
the
now
long
defunct
that
most
of
our
own
motions
were
a
kicking
of
them
up
the
rankness
of
the
plant
was
all
in
the
air
and
small
boys
pranced
about
as
cavaliers
whacking
their
steeds
there
were
bigger
boys
bolder
still
to
whom
this
vegetation
or
something
kindred
that
escapes
me
yielded
long
black
beanlike
slips
which
they
lighted
and
smoked
the
smaller
ones
staring
and
impressed
i
at
any
rate
think
of
the
small
one
i
can
best
speak
for
as
constantly
wading
through
an
indian
summer
of
these
fascinated
by
the
process
the
joy
of
lonely
trudges
over
a
course
in
which
those
parts
and
the
slightly
more
northward
pleasantly
confound
themselves
these
were
the
homely
joys
of
the
nobler
neighbourhood
elements
that
had
their
match
and
more
hard
by
the
fourteenth
street
home
in
the
poplars
the
pigs
the
poultry
and
the
irish
houses
two
or
three
in
number
exclusive
of
a
very
fine
dutch
one
seated
then
this
last
almost
as
among
gardens
and
groves
a
breadth
of
territory
still
apparent
on
the
spot
in
that
marginal
ease
that
spread
of
occupation
to
the
nearly
complete
absence
of
which
new
york
aspects
owe
their
general
failure
of
style
but
there
were
finer
vibrations
as
well
for
the
infant
though
none
perhaps
so
fine
as
when
he
stood
long
and
drank
deep
at
those
founts
of
romance
that
gushed
from
the
huge
placards
of
the
theatre
these
announcements
at
a
day
when
advertisement
was
contentedly
but
information
had
very
much
the
form
of
magnified
playbills
they
consisted
of
vast
oblong
sheets
yellow
or
white
pasted
upon
tall
wooden
screens
or
into
hollow
sockets
and
acquainting
the
possible
playgoer
with
every
circumstance
that
might
seriously
interest
him
these
screens
rested
sociably
against
trees
and
as
well
as
against
walls
and
fences
to
all
of
which
they
were
i
suppose
familiarly
attached
but
the
sweetest
note
of
their
confidence
was
that
in
parallel
lines
and
the
good
old
way
characters
facing
performers
they
gave
the
whole
cast
which
in
the
palmy
days
of
the
drama
often
involved
many
names
i
catch
myself
again
in
the
fact
of
endless
stations
in
fifth
avenue
near
the
southwest
corner
of
ninth
street
as
i
think
it
must
have
been
since
the
dull
long
run
did
exist
then
for
the
young
and
the
poster
there
was
constantly
and
bravely
renewed
it
engaged
my
attention
whenever
i
passed
as
the
canvas
of
a
great
master
in
a
great
gallery
holds
that
of
the
pious
tourist
and
even
though
i
ca
at
this
day
be
sure
of
its
special
reference
i
was
with
precocious
passion
at
home
among
the
theatres
thanks
to
our
parents
fond
interest
in
them
as
from
this
distance
i
see
it
flourish
for
the
time
and
to
the
liberal
law
and
happy
view
under
which
the
addiction
was
shared
with
us
they
never
caring
much
for
things
we
could
care
for
and
generally
holding
that
what
was
good
to
them
would
be
also
good
for
their
children
it
had
the
effect
certainly
of
preparing
for
these
so
far
as
we
should
incline
to
cherish
it
a
strange
little
fund
of
theatrical
reminiscence
a
small
hoard
of
memories
maintaining
itself
in
my
own
case
for
a
lifetime
and
causing
me
to
wonder
before
its
abundance
on
how
many
evenings
of
the
month
or
perhaps
even
of
the
week
we
were
torn
from
the
pursuits
of
home
ix
the
truth
is
doubtless
however
much
less
in
the
wealth
of
my
experience
than
in
the
tenacity
of
my
impression
the
fact
that
i
have
lost
nothing
of
what
i
saw
and
that
though
i
ca
now
quite
divide
the
total
into
separate
occasions
the
various
items
surprisingly
swarm
for
me
i
shall
return
to
some
of
them
wishing
at
present
only
to
make
my
point
of
when
and
how
the
seeds
were
sown
that
afterwards
so
thickly
sprouted
and
flowered
i
was
greatly
to
love
the
drama
at
its
best
as
a
form
whatever
variations
of
faith
or
curiosity
i
was
to
know
in
respect
to
the
infirm
and
inadequate
theatre
there
was
of
course
anciently
no
question
for
us
of
the
drama
at
its
best
and
indeed
while
i
lately
by
chance
looked
over
a
copious
collection
of
theatrical
portraits
beginning
with
the
earliest
age
of
lithography
and
photography
as
so
applied
and
documentary
in
the
highest
degree
on
the
personalities
as
we
nowadays
say
of
the
old
american
stage
stupefaction
grew
sharp
in
me
and
scepticism
triumphed
so
vulgar
so
barbarous
seemed
the
array
of
types
so
extraordinarily
provincial
the
note
of
every
figure
so
less
than
scant
the
claim
of
such
physiognomies
and
such
reputations
rather
dismal
everywhere
i
admit
the
histrionic
image
with
the
artificial
lights
turned
off
the
fatigued
and
disconnected
face
reduced
to
its
mere
self
and
resembling
some
closed
and
darkened
inn
with
the
sign
still
swung
but
the
place
blighted
for
want
of
custom
that
consideration
weighs
but
what
a
gang
all
the
same
when
thus
left
to
their
own
devices
the
performers
men
and
women
alike
of
that
world
of
queer
appreciations
i
ought
perhaps
to
bear
on
them
lightly
in
view
of
what
in
especial
comes
back
to
me
the
sense
of
the
sacred
thrill
with
which
i
began
to
watch
the
green
curtain
the
particular
one
that
was
to
rise
to
the
comedy
of
errors
on
the
occasion
that
must
have
been
for
what
i
recall
of
its
almost
unbearable
intensity
the
very
first
of
my
ever
sitting
at
a
play
i
should
have
been
indebted
for
the
momentous
evening
in
that
case
to
william
burton
whose
small
theatre
in
chambers
street
to
the
rear
of
stewart
big
shop
and
hard
by
the
park
as
the
park
was
at
that
time
understood
offered
me
then
my
prime
initiation
let
me
not
complain
of
my
having
owed
the
adventure
to
a
still
greater
william
as
well
nor
think
again
without
the
right
intensity
the
scarce
tolerable
throb
of
the
way
the
torment
of
the
curtain
was
mixed
half
so
dark
a
defiance
and
half
so
rich
a
promise
one
eyes
bored
into
it
in
vain
and
yet
one
knew
it
rise
at
the
named
hour
the
only
question
being
if
one
could
exist
till
then
the
play
had
been
read
to
us
during
the
day
a
celebrated
english
actor
whose
name
i
inconsistently
forget
had
arrived
to
match
burton
as
the
other
of
the
dromios
and
the
agreeable
holman
who
had
to
my
relentless
vision
too
retreating
a
chin
was
so
good
as
to
represent
adriana
i
regarded
holman
as
a
friend
though
in
no
warmer
light
than
that
in
which
i
regarded
miss
mary
taylor
save
indeed
that
holman
had
the
pull
on
affections
of
coming
out
to
sing
in
white
satin
and
quite
irrelevantly
between
the
acts
an
advantage
she
shared
with
the
younger
and
fairer
and
more
dashing
the
dancing
miss
malvina
who
footed
it
and
tambourined
it
and
shawled
it
irruptively
in
lonely
state
when
not
admiring
burton
in
shakespeare
we
admired
him
as
paul
pry
as
toodles
and
as
aminadab
sleek
in
the
serious
family
and
we
must
have
admired
him
very
much
his
huge
fat
person
his
huge
fat
face
and
his
vast
slightly
pendulous
cheek
surmounted
by
a
sort
of
elephantine
wink
to
which
i
impute
a
remarkable
baseness
being
still
perfectly
present
to
me
we
discriminated
none
the
less
we
thought
blake
a
much
finer
comedian
much
more
of
a
gentleman
and
a
scholar
mellow
blake
whom
with
the
brave
and
emphatic
blake
they
must
have
made
their
points
i
connect
partly
with
the
burton
scene
and
partly
with
that
of
slightly
subsequent
creation
which
after
flourishing
awhile
slightly
further
up
broadway
under
the
charmlessly
commercial
name
of
brougham
lyceum
we
had
almost
only
lyceums
and
museums
and
lecture
rooms
and
academies
of
music
for
playhouse
and
opera
then
entered
upon
a
long
career
and
a
migratory
life
as
wallack
theatre
i
fail
doubtless
to
keep
my
associations
clear
but
what
is
important
or
what
i
desire
at
least
to
make
pass
for
such
is
that
when
we
most
admired
blake
we
also
again
admired
miss
mary
taylor
and
it
was
at
brougham
not
at
burton
that
we
rendered
that
tribute
reserved
for
her
performance
of
the
fond
theatrical
daughter
in
the
english
version
of
le
père
de
la
débutante
where
i
see
the
charming
panting
creature
in
flowing
white
classically
relieved
by
a
gold
tiara
and
a
golden
scarf
rush
back
from
the
supposed
stage
to
the
represented
followed
by
thunders
of
applause
and
throw
herself
upon
the
neck
of
the
old
gentleman
in
a
blue
coat
with
brass
buttons
who
must
have
been
after
all
on
second
thoughts
placide
greater
flights
or
more
delicate
shades
the
art
of
pathetic
comedy
was
at
that
time
held
not
to
achieve
only
i
straighten
it
out
that
and
blake
not
less
than
miss
mary
taylor
who
preponderantly
haunts
my
vision
even
to
the
disadvantage
of
miss
kate
horn
in
nan
the
until
indeed
she
is
displaced
by
the
brilliant
laura
keene
did
migrate
to
brougham
where
we
found
them
all
themselves
as
goldsmith
hardcastle
pair
and
other
like
matters
we
rallied
especially
to
blake
as
dogberry
on
the
occasion
of
my
second
shakespearean
night
for
as
such
i
seem
to
place
it
when
laura
keene
and
lester
the
lester
wallack
that
was
to
be
did
beatrice
and
benedick
i
yield
to
this
further
proof
that
we
had
our
proportion
of
shakespeare
though
perhaps
antedating
that
rapt
vision
of
much
ado
which
may
have
been
preceded
by
the
dazzled
apprehension
of
a
midsummer
night
dream
at
the
broadway
there
a
confessed
theatre
this
latter
now
present
to
me
in
every
bright
particular
it
supplied
us
we
must
have
felt
our
greatest
conceivable
adventure
i
can
not
otherwise
account
for
its
emerging
so
clear
everything
here
is
as
of
yesterday
the
identity
of
the
actors
the
details
of
their
dress
the
charm
imparted
by
the
sisters
gougenheim
the
elegant
elder
as
the
infatuated
helena
and
the
other
the
roguish
joey
as
the
mischievous
puck
hermia
was
nagle
in
a
short
peplum
over
a
white
petticoat
the
whole
bulgingly
confined
by
a
girdle
of
shining
gilt
and
forming
a
contrast
to
the
loose
scarves
of
helena
while
nagle
not
devoid
i
seem
to
remember
of
a
blue
chin
and
the
latency
of
a
fine
brogue
was
either
lysander
or
demetrius
davidge
also
i
surmise
with
a
brogue
was
bottom
the
weaver
and
madame
ponisi
oberon
madame
ponisi
whose
range
must
have
been
wide
since
i
see
her
also
as
the
heroine
of
the
cataract
of
the
ganges
where
preferring
death
to
dishonour
she
dashes
up
the
more
or
less
perpendicular
waterfall
on
a
fiery
black
steed
and
with
an
effect
only
a
little
blighted
by
the
chance
flutter
of
a
drapery
out
of
which
peeps
the
leg
of
a
trouser
and
a
big
male
foot
and
then
again
though
presumably
at
a
somewhat
later
time
or
in
strictness
childhood
fond
hour
as
this
and
that
noble
matron
or
tragedy
queen
i
descry
her
at
any
rate
as
representing
all
characters
alike
with
a
broad
brown
face
framed
in
bands
or
crowns
or
other
heavy
headgear
out
of
which
cropped
a
row
of
very
small
tight
black
curls
the
cataract
of
the
ganges
is
all
there
as
well
a
tragedy
of
temples
and
idols
and
wicked
rajahs
and
real
water
with
davidge
and
joey
gougenheim
again
for
comic
relief
though
all
in
a
coarser
radiance
thanks
to
the
absence
of
fairies
and
amazons
and
moonlit
mechanical
effects
the
charm
above
all
so
seen
of
the
play
within
the
play
and
i
rank
it
in
that
relation
with
green
bushes
despite
the
celebrity
in
the
latter
of
madame
céleste
who
came
to
us
straight
out
of
london
and
whose
admired
walk
up
the
stage
as
miami
the
huntress
a
wonderful
majestic
and
yet
voluptuous
stride
enhanced
by
a
short
kilt
black
velvet
leggings
and
a
gun
haughtily
borne
on
the
shoulder
is
vividly
before
me
as
i
write
the
piece
in
question
was
i
recall
from
the
pen
of
bourcicault
as
he
then
wrote
his
name
he
was
so
early
in
the
field
and
must
have
been
from
long
before
inasmuch
as
he
now
appears
to
me
to
have
supplied
brougham
of
the
lyceum
aforesaid
with
his
choicest
productions
i
sit
again
at
london
assurance
with
wallack
fanny
wallack
i
think
not
that
i
quite
know
who
she
was
as
lady
gay
spanker
flushed
and
vociferous
first
in
a
with
a
tail
yards
long
and
afterwards
in
yellow
satin
with
scarce
a
tail
at
all
i
am
present
also
at
love
in
a
maze
in
which
the
stage
represented
with
primitive
art
i
fear
a
supposedly
intricate
and
in
which
i
admired
for
the
first
time
russell
afterwards
long
before
the
public
as
hoey
even
if
opining
that
she
wanted
especially
for
the
ordeal
less
osseous
a
structure
there
are
pieces
of
that
general
association
i
admit
the
clue
to
which
slips
from
me
the
drama
of
modern
life
and
of
french
origin
though
what
was
then
not
of
french
origin
in
which
miss
julia
bennett
fresh
from
triumphs
at
the
haymarket
made
her
first
appearance
in
a
very
becoming
white
bonnet
either
as
a
brilliant
adventuress
or
as
the
innocent
victim
of
licentious
design
i
forget
which
though
with
a
sense
somehow
that
the
white
bonnet
when
of
true
elegance
was
the
note
at
that
period
of
the
adventuress
miss
julia
bennett
with
whom
at
a
later
age
one
was
to
renew
acquaintance
as
the
artful
and
ample
barrow
full
of
manner
and
presence
and
often
edwin
booth
portia
desdemona
and
julie
de
mortemer
i
figure
her
as
having
in
the
dimmer
phase
succeeded
to
miss
laura
keene
at
wallack
on
the
secession
thence
of
this
original
charmer
of
our
parents
the
flutter
of
whose
prime
advent
is
perfectly
present
to
me
with
the
relish
expressed
for
that
english
sweetness
of
her
speech
i
already
wondered
why
it
be
english
which
was
not
as
the
speech
mostly
known
to
us
the
uncles
within
my
hearing
even
imitated
for
commendation
some
of
her
choicer
sounds
to
which
i
strained
my
ear
on
seeing
her
afterwards
as
chillington
in
the
refined
comedietta
of
a
morning
call
where
she
made
delightful
game
of
lester
as
sir
edward
ardent
even
to
the
point
of
causing
him
to
crawl
about
on
all
fours
and
covered
with
her
shawl
after
the
fashion
of
a
that
delightful
impression
was
then
unconscious
of
the
blight
to
come
that
of
my
apprehending
years
after
that
the
brilliant
comedietta
was
the
tribute
of
our
taste
to
alfred
de
musset
elegant
proverb
of
the
porte
ouverte
ou
fermée
in
which
nothing
could
find
itself
less
at
home
than
the
horseplay
of
the
english
version
miss
laura
keene
with
a
native
grace
at
the
start
a
fresh
and
delicate
inspiration
i
infer
from
the
kind
of
pleasure
she
appears
to
have
begun
with
giving
was
to
live
to
belie
her
promise
and
becoming
hard
and
raddled
forfeit
on
the
evidence
all
claim
to
the
higher
distinction
a
fact
not
surprising
under
the
lurid
light
projected
by
such
a
sign
of
the
atmosphere
of
ineptitude
as
an
accepted
and
condoned
perversion
to
vulgarity
of
musset
perfect
little
work
how
quality
of
talent
consort
with
so
dire
an
absence
of
quality
in
the
material
offered
it
where
could
such
lapses
lead
but
to
dust
and
desolation
and
what
happy
instinct
not
be
smothered
in
an
air
so
dismally
is
it
a
foolish
fallacy
that
these
matters
may
have
been
on
occasion
at
that
time
worth
speaking
of
is
it
only
presumable
that
everything
was
perfectly
cheap
and
common
and
everyone
perfectly
bad
and
barbarous
and
that
even
the
least
corruptible
of
our
typical
spectators
were
too
easily
beguiled
and
too
helplessly
kind
the
beauty
of
the
main
truth
as
to
any
remembered
matter
looked
at
in
due
detachment
or
in
other
words
through
the
haze
of
time
is
that
comprehension
has
then
become
one
with
criticism
compassion
as
it
may
really
be
called
one
with
musing
vision
and
the
whole
company
of
the
anciently
restless
with
their
elations
and
mistakes
their
sincerities
and
fallacies
and
vanities
and
triumphs
embalmed
for
us
in
the
mild
essence
of
their
collective
submission
to
fate
we
need
be
strenuous
about
them
unless
we
particularly
want
to
and
are
glad
to
remember
in
season
all
that
this
would
imply
of
the
strenuous
about
our
own
our
muddled
initiations
if
nothing
is
more
certain
for
us
than
that
many
persons
within
our
recollection
could
help
being
rather
generally
unadmonished
and
unaware
so
nothing
is
more
in
the
note
of
peace
than
that
such
a
perceived
state
pushed
to
a
point
makes
our
scales
of
judgment
but
ridiculously
rattle
admonition
our
superior
awareness
is
of
many
things
and
among
these
of
how
infinitely
at
the
worst
they
lived
the
pale
superseded
and
how
much
it
was
by
their
virtue
which
reflections
in
the
train
of
such
memories
as
those
just
gathered
may
perhaps
seem
though
they
really
to
my
own
eyes
cause
the
images
to
multiply
still
others
of
these
break
in
upon
me
and
refuse
to
be
slighted
reconstituting
as
i
practically
am
the
history
of
my
fostered
imagination
for
whatever
it
may
be
worth
i
wo
pretend
to
a
disrespect
for
contributive
particle
i
left
myself
just
above
staring
at
the
fifth
avenue
poster
and
i
ca
but
linger
there
while
the
vision
it
evokes
insists
on
swarming
it
was
the
age
of
the
arrangements
of
dickens
for
the
stage
promptly
on
every
scene
and
which
must
have
been
the
roughest
theatrical
tinkers
work
but
at
two
or
three
of
which
we
certainly
assisted
i
associate
them
with
brougham
temple
of
the
art
yet
am
at
the
same
time
beset
with
the
captain
cuttle
of
dombey
and
son
in
the
form
of
the
big
burton
who
never
i
earnestly
conceive
graced
that
shrine
so
that
i
wander
a
trifle
confusedly
is
it
he
whom
i
remember
as
a
monstrous
micawber
the
coarse
parody
of
a
charming
creation
with
the
entire
baldness
of
a
huge
easter
egg
and
like
the
sails
of
mediterranean
feluccas
dire
of
course
for
all
temperance
in
these
connections
was
the
need
to
conform
to
the
illustrations
of
phiz
himself
already
an
improvising
parodist
and
happy
only
so
long
as
not
imitated
not
literally
reproduced
strange
enough
the
æsthetic
of
artists
who
could
desire
but
literally
to
reproduce
i
give
the
whole
question
up
however
i
stray
too
in
the
dust
and
with
a
positive
sense
of
having
in
the
first
place
but
languished
at
home
when
my
betters
admired
miss
cushman
terribly
out
of
the
picture
and
the
frame
we
should
pronounce
her
i
fear
as
the
nancy
of
oliver
twist
as
far
away
this
must
have
been
as
the
lifetime
of
the
prehistoric
park
to
which
it
was
just
within
my
knowledge
that
my
elders
went
for
opera
to
come
back
on
us
sounding
those
rich
old
italian
names
bosio
and
badiali
ronconi
and
steffanone
i
am
not
sure
i
have
them
quite
right
signs
of
a
rueful
sound
to
us
that
the
line
as
to
our
infant
participation
somewhere
drawn
it
had
not
been
drawn
i
all
the
more
like
to
remember
when
under
proper
protection
at
castle
garden
i
listened
to
that
rarest
of
infant
phenomena
adelina
patti
poised
in
an
armchair
that
had
been
pushed
to
the
footlights
and
announcing
her
incomparable
gift
she
was
about
of
our
own
age
she
was
one
of
us
even
though
at
the
same
time
the
most
prodigious
of
fairies
of
glittering
fables
that
principle
of
selection
was
indeed
in
abeyance
while
i
sat
with
my
mother
either
at
tripler
hall
or
at
niblo
i
am
vague
about
the
occasion
but
the
names
as
for
fine
old
confused
reasons
plead
alike
to
my
pen
and
paid
a
homage
quite
other
than
critical
i
dare
say
to
the
then
slightly
worn
henrietta
sontag
countess
rossi
who
struck
us
as
supremely
elegant
in
pink
silk
and
white
lace
flounces
and
with
whom
there
had
been
for
certain
members
of
our
circle
some
contact
or
intercourse
that
i
have
wonderingly
lost
i
learned
at
that
hour
in
any
case
what
acclamation
might
mean
and
have
again
before
me
the
vast
auditory
thundering
applause
at
the
beautiful
pink
clear
a
thrilling
a
tremendous
experience
and
my
sole
other
memory
of
at
that
age
save
the
impression
of
a
strange
huddled
hour
in
some
smaller
public
place
some
very
minor
hall
under
dim
lamps
and
again
in
my
mother
company
where
we
were
so
near
the
improvised
platform
that
my
nose
was
brushed
by
the
petticoats
of
the
distinguished
amateur
who
sang
casta
diva
a
very
fine
fair
woman
with
a
great
heaving
of
bosom
and
flirt
of
crinoline
and
that
the
ringletted
italian
gentleman
in
black
velvet
and
a
romantic
voluminous
cloak
who
represented
or
rather
who
professionally
and
uncontrollably
was
an
improvisatore
had
for
me
the
effect
as
i
crouched
gaping
of
quite
bellowing
down
my
throat
that
occasion
i
am
clear
was
a
concert
for
a
charity
with
the
volunteer
performance
and
the
social
patroness
and
it
had
squeezed
in
where
it
would
at
the
same
time
that
i
somehow
connect
the
place
in
broadway
on
the
right
going
down
and
not
much
below
fourth
street
except
that
everything
seems
to
me
to
have
been
just
below
fourth
street
when
not
just
above
with
the
scene
of
my
great
public
exposure
somewhat
later
the
wonderful
exhibition
of
signor
blitz
the
peerless
conjurer
who
on
my
attending
his
entertainment
with
and
our
frequent
comrade
of
the
early
time
hal
coster
practised
on
my
innocence
to
seduce
me
to
the
stage
and
there
plunge
me
into
the
shame
of
my
sad
failure
to
account
arithmetically
for
his
bewilderingly
subtracted
or
added
or
divided
pockethandkerchiefs
and
a
paralysis
of
wit
as
to
which
i
once
more
and
with
the
same
wan
despair
feel
my
companions
shy
telegraphy
of
relief
their
snickerings
and
mouthings
and
raised
numerical
fingers
reach
me
from
the
benches
the
second
definite
matter
in
the
dickens
connection
is
the
smike
of
miss
weston
whose
prænomen
i
frivolously
forget
though
i
fear
it
was
lizzie
but
who
was
afterwards
davenport
and
then
sequently
to
some
public
strife
or
chatter
charles
matthews
in
a
version
of
nicholas
nickleby
that
gracelessly
managed
to
be
all
tearful
melodrama
foundlings
wicked
ralph
nicklebys
and
scowling
arthur
grides
with
other
baffled
villains
and
scarcely
at
all
crummleses
and
kenwigses
much
less
squeerses
though
there
must
have
been
something
of
dotheboys
hall
for
the
proper
tragedy
of
smike
and
for
the
broad
yorkshire
effect
a
precious
theatrical
value
of
john
brodie
the
ineffaceability
was
the
anguish
to
my
tender
sense
of
starved
and
tattered
and
fawning
and
whining
protégé
in
face
of
my
sharp
retention
of
which
through
all
the
years
who
shall
deny
the
immense
authority
of
the
theatre
or
that
the
stage
is
the
mightiest
of
modern
engines
such
at
least
was
to
be
the
force
of
the
dickens
imprint
however
applied
in
the
soft
clay
of
our
generation
it
was
to
resist
so
serenely
the
wash
of
the
waves
of
time
to
be
brought
up
thus
against
the
author
of
it
or
to
speak
at
all
of
the
dawn
of
one
early
consciousness
of
it
and
of
his
presence
and
power
is
to
begin
to
tread
ground
at
once
sacred
and
boundless
the
associations
of
which
looming
large
warn
us
off
even
while
they
hold
he
did
too
much
for
us
surely
ever
to
leave
us
free
free
of
judgment
free
of
reaction
even
should
we
care
to
be
which
heaven
forbid
he
laid
his
hand
on
us
in
a
way
to
undermine
as
in
no
other
case
the
power
of
detached
appraisement
we
react
against
other
productions
of
the
general
kind
without
liking
them
the
less
but
we
somehow
liked
dickens
the
more
for
having
forfeited
half
the
claim
to
appreciation
that
process
belongs
to
the
fact
that
criticism
roundabout
him
is
somehow
futile
and
tasteless
his
own
taste
is
easily
impugned
but
he
entered
so
early
into
the
blood
and
bone
of
our
intelligence
that
it
always
remained
better
than
the
taste
of
overhauling
him
when
i
take
him
up
and
find
myself
holding
off
i
simply
stop
not
holding
off
that
is
but
holding
on
and
from
the
very
fear
to
do
so
which
sounds
i
recognise
like
perusal
like
renewal
of
the
scantest
i
do
renew
i
would
renew
for
the
world
would
that
is
with
one
treasure
so
hoarded
in
the
dusty
chamber
of
youth
let
in
the
intellectual
air
happy
the
house
of
life
in
which
such
chambers
still
hold
out
even
with
the
draught
of
the
intellect
whistling
through
the
passages
we
were
practically
contemporary
contemporary
with
the
issues
the
fluttering
monthly
numbers
that
was
the
point
it
made
for
us
a
good
fortune
constituted
for
us
in
itself
romance
on
which
nothing
to
the
end
succeeds
in
laying
its
hands
the
whole
question
dwells
for
me
in
a
single
small
reminiscence
though
there
are
others
still
that
of
my
having
been
sent
to
bed
one
evening
in
fourteenth
street
as
a
very
small
boy
at
an
hour
when
in
the
library
and
under
the
lamp
one
of
the
elder
cousins
from
albany
the
youngest
of
an
orphaned
brood
of
four
of
my
grandmother
most
extravagant
adoption
had
begun
to
read
aloud
to
my
mother
the
new
which
must
have
been
the
first
instalment
of
david
copperfield
i
had
feigned
to
withdraw
but
had
only
retreated
to
cover
close
at
hand
the
friendly
shade
of
some
screen
or
drooping
folded
up
behind
which
and
glued
to
the
carpet
i
held
my
breath
and
listened
i
listened
long
and
drank
deep
while
the
wondrous
picture
grew
but
the
tense
cord
at
last
snapped
under
the
strain
of
the
murdstones
and
i
broke
into
the
sobs
of
sympathy
that
disclosed
my
subterfuge
i
was
this
time
effectively
banished
but
the
ply
then
taken
was
ineffaceable
i
remember
indeed
just
afterwards
finding
the
sequel
in
especial
the
vast
extrusion
of
the
micawbers
beyond
my
actual
capacity
which
took
a
few
years
to
grow
adequate
years
in
which
the
general
contagious
consciousness
and
our
own
household
response
not
least
breathed
heavily
through
hard
times
bleak
house
and
little
dorrit
the
seeds
of
acquaintance
with
chuzzlewit
and
dombey
and
son
these
coming
thickly
on
i
had
found
already
sown
i
was
to
feel
that
i
had
been
born
born
to
a
rich
awareness
under
the
very
meridian
there
sprouted
in
those
years
no
such
other
crop
of
ready
references
as
the
golden
harvest
of
copperfield
yet
if
i
was
to
wait
to
achieve
the
happier
of
these
recognitions
i
had
already
pored
over
oliver
twist
albeit
now
uncertain
of
the
relation
borne
by
that
experience
to
the
incident
just
recalled
when
oliver
was
new
to
me
at
any
rate
he
was
already
old
to
my
betters
whose
view
of
his
particular
adventures
and
exposures
must
have
been
concerned
i
think
moreover
in
the
fact
of
my
public
and
lively
wonder
about
them
it
was
an
exhibition
deprecated
to
infant
innocence
i
judge
unless
indeed
my
remembrance
of
enjoying
it
only
on
the
terms
of
fitful
snatches
in
another
though
a
kindred
house
is
due
mainly
to
the
existence
there
of
george
cruikshank
splendid
form
of
the
work
of
which
our
own
foreground
was
clear
it
perhaps
even
seemed
to
me
more
cruikshank
than
dickens
it
was
a
thing
of
such
vividly
terrible
images
and
all
marked
with
that
peculiarity
of
cruikshank
that
the
offered
flowers
or
goodnesses
the
scenes
and
figures
intended
to
comfort
and
cheer
present
themselves
under
his
hand
as
but
more
subtly
sinister
or
more
suggestively
queer
than
the
frank
badnesses
and
horrors
the
nice
people
and
the
happy
moments
in
the
plates
frightened
me
almost
as
much
as
the
low
and
the
awkward
which
however
make
the
volumes
a
source
of
attraction
the
less
toward
that
high
and
square
old
just
westward
of
sixth
avenue
as
we
in
the
same
street
were
related
to
it
that
formed
romantically
half
our
alternative
domestic
field
and
offered
to
our
small
inquiring
steps
a
larger
range
and
privilege
if
the
dickens
of
those
years
was
as
i
have
just
called
him
the
great
actuality
of
the
current
imagination
so
i
at
once
meet
him
in
force
as
a
feature
even
of
conditions
in
which
he
was
but
indirectly
involved
for
the
other
house
the
house
we
most
haunted
after
our
own
was
that
of
our
cousin
albert
still
another
of
the
blest
orphans
though
this
time
of
our
mother
kindred
and
if
it
was
my
habit
as
i
have
hinted
to
attribute
to
orphans
as
orphans
a
circumstantial
charm
a
setting
necessarily
more
delightful
than
our
father
and
mother
one
so
there
spread
about
this
appointed
comrade
the
perfection
of
the
type
inasmuch
as
he
alone
was
neither
brother
nor
sister
an
air
of
possibilities
that
were
none
the
less
vivid
for
being
quite
indefinite
he
was
to
embody
in
due
course
poor
young
man
some
of
these
possibilities
those
that
had
originally
been
for
me
the
vaguest
of
all
but
to
fix
his
situation
from
my
present
view
is
not
so
much
to
wonder
that
it
spoke
to
me
of
a
wild
freedom
as
to
see
in
it
the
elements
of
a
rich
and
rounded
picture
the
frame
was
still
there
but
a
short
time
since
cracked
and
empty
broken
and
gaping
like
those
few
others
of
the
general
overgrown
scene
that
my
late
quest
had
puzzled
out
and
this
has
somehow
helped
me
to
read
back
into
it
the
old
figures
and
the
old
long
story
told
as
with
excellent
art
we
knew
the
figures
well
while
they
lasted
and
had
with
them
the
happiest
relation
but
without
doing
justice
to
their
truth
of
outline
their
felicity
of
character
and
force
of
expression
and
function
above
all
to
the
compositional
harmony
in
which
they
moved
that
lives
again
to
my
considering
eyes
and
i
admire
as
never
before
the
fine
artistry
of
fate
our
cousin
guardian
the
natural
and
the
legal
was
his
aunt
his
only
one
who
was
the
cousin
of
our
mother
and
our
own
aunt
virtually
only
one
so
far
as
a
felt
and
adopted
closeness
of
kinship
went
and
the
three
daughters
of
two
sole
and
sisters
had
been
so
brought
up
together
as
to
have
quite
all
the
signs
and
accents
of
the
same
strain
and
the
same
nest
the
cousin
helen
of
our
young
prospect
was
thus
all
but
the
sister
helen
of
our
mother
lifetime
as
was
to
happen
and
was
scarcely
less
a
stout
brave
presence
and
an
emphasised
character
for
the
new
generation
than
for
the
old
noted
here
as
she
is
in
particular
for
her
fine
value
of
clearness
and
straightness
i
see
in
her
strong
simplicity
that
of
an
earlier
quieter
world
a
new
york
of
better
manners
and
better
morals
and
homelier
beliefs
the
very
elements
of
some
portrait
by
a
grave
dutch
or
other
master
she
looks
out
with
some
of
the
strong
marks
the
anxious
honesty
the
modest
humour
the
folded
resting
hands
the
dark
handsome
serious
attire
the
important
composed
cap
almost
the
badge
of
a
guild
or
an
order
that
hang
together
about
the
images
of
past
worthies
of
whichever
sex
who
have
had
as
one
may
say
the
courage
of
their
character
and
qualify
them
for
places
in
great
collections
i
note
with
appreciation
that
she
was
strenuously
actively
good
and
have
the
liveliest
impression
both
that
no
one
was
ever
better
and
that
her
goodness
somehow
testifies
for
the
whole
tone
of
a
society
a
remarkable
cluster
of
private
decencies
her
value
to
my
imagination
is
even
most
of
all
perhaps
in
her
mere
local
consistency
her
fine
old
new
york
ignorance
and
rigour
her
traditions
scant
but
stiff
had
grown
there
close
to
her
they
were
all
she
needed
and
she
lived
by
them
candidly
and
stoutly
that
there
have
been
persons
so
little
doubtful
of
duty
helps
to
show
us
how
societies
grow
a
proportionately
small
amount
of
absolute
conviction
about
it
will
carry
we
thus
make
out
a
vast
dead
weight
of
mere
comparative
she
was
as
anxious
over
hers
indeed
as
if
it
had
ever
been
in
question
which
is
a
proof
perhaps
that
being
void
of
imagination
when
you
are
quite
entirely
void
makes
scarcely
more
for
comfort
than
having
too
much
which
only
makes
in
a
manner
for
a
homeless
freedom
or
even
at
the
worst
for
a
questioned
veracity
with
a
big
installed
conscience
there
is
virtue
in
a
grain
of
the
figurative
faculty
it
acts
as
oil
to
the
stiff
machine
yet
this
life
of
straight
and
narrow
insistences
seated
so
clearly
in
our
view
did
take
up
all
the
room
in
the
other
house
the
house
of
the
pictured
the
intermittent
oliver
though
of
the
fewer
books
in
general
than
ours
and
of
the
finer
proportions
and
less
peopled
spaces
there
were
but
three
persons
to
fill
them
as
well
as
of
the
more
turbaned
and
powdered
family
portraits
one
of
these
the
most
antique
a
french
pastel
which
must
have
been
charming
of
a
young
collateral
ancestor
who
had
died
on
the
european
tour
a
vast
marginal
range
seemed
to
me
on
the
contrary
to
surround
the
adolescent
nephew
who
was
some
three
years
i
judge
beyond
me
in
age
and
had
other
horizons
and
prospects
than
ours
no
question
of
europe
for
him
but
a
patriotic
preparation
for
acquaintance
with
the
south
and
west
or
what
was
then
called
the
west
he
was
to
see
his
own
country
first
winking
at
us
while
he
did
so
though
he
was
in
spite
of
differences
so
nearly
and
naturally
neighbour
and
brother
with
us
that
the
extensions
of
his
range
and
the
charms
of
his
position
counted
somehow
as
the
limits
and
the
humilities
of
ours
he
went
neither
to
our
schools
nor
to
our
hotels
but
hovered
out
of
our
view
in
some
other
educational
air
that
i
ca
now
point
to
and
had
in
a
remote
part
of
the
state
a
vast
wild
property
of
his
own
known
as
the
beaverkill
to
which
so
far
from
his
aunt
and
his
uncle
taking
him
there
he
affably
took
them
and
to
which
also
he
vainly
invited
and
me
pointing
thereby
to
us
however
though
indirectly
enough
perhaps
the
finest
childish
case
we
were
to
know
for
the
famous
acceptance
of
the
inevitable
it
was
apparently
not
to
be
thought
of
that
instead
of
the
inevitable
we
should
accept
the
invitation
the
place
was
in
the
wilderness
incalculably
distant
reached
by
a
whole
day
rough
drive
from
the
railroad
through
every
danger
of
flood
and
field
with
prowling
bears
thrown
in
and
probable
loss
of
limb
of
which
there
were
sad
examples
from
swinging
scythes
and
axes
but
we
of
course
measured
our
privation
just
by
those
facts
and
grew
up
so
far
as
we
did
then
grow
to
believe
that
pleasures
beyond
price
had
been
cruelly
denied
us
i
at
any
rate
myself
grew
up
sufficiently
to
wonder
if
poor
albert
type
as
it
developed
to
the
anxious
elder
view
from
the
first
might
rather
have
undermined
countenance
his
pleasant
foolish
face
and
odd
shy
air
of
being
suspected
or
convicted
on
grounds
less
vague
to
himself
than
to
us
may
well
have
appeared
symptoms
of
the
course
of
the
rig
he
was
eventually
to
run
i
could
think
of
him
but
as
the
de
ideally
constituted
not
that
i
could
then
use
for
him
that
designation
but
that
i
felt
he
must
belong
to
an
important
special
class
which
he
in
fact
formed
in
his
own
person
everything
was
right
truly
for
these
felicities
to
speak
of
them
only
as
dramatic
or
pictorial
values
since
if
we
were
present
all
the
while
at
more
of
a
drama
than
we
knew
so
at
least
to
my
vague
divination
the
scene
and
the
figures
were
there
not
excluding
the
chorus
and
i
must
have
had
the
instinct
of
their
being
as
right
as
possible
i
see
the
actors
move
again
through
the
high
rather
bedimmed
rooms
it
is
always
a
matter
of
winter
twilight
firelight
lamplight
each
one
appointed
to
his
or
her
part
and
perfect
for
the
picture
which
gave
a
sense
of
fulness
without
ever
being
crowded
that
composition
had
to
wait
awhile
in
the
earliest
time
to
find
its
proper
centre
having
been
from
the
free
point
of
view
i
thus
cultivate
a
little
encumbered
by
the
presence
of
the
most
aged
of
our
relatives
the
oldest
person
i
remember
to
have
familiarly
known
if
it
can
be
called
familiar
to
have
stood
off
in
fear
of
such
strange
proofs
of
accomplished
time
our
wyckoff
our
maternal
elder
sister
i
infer
and
an
image
of
living
antiquity
as
i
figure
her
that
i
was
never
to
see
surpassed
i
invest
her
in
this
vision
with
all
the
that
may
accrue
to
the
venerable
solidly
seated
or
even
throned
hooded
and
draped
and
with
big
protective
protrusive
ears
to
her
chair
which
helped
it
to
the
effect
of
a
shrine
and
a
large
face
in
which
the
odd
blackness
of
eyebrow
and
of
a
couple
of
other
touches
suggested
the
conventional
marks
of
a
painted
image
she
signified
her
wants
as
divinities
do
for
i
recover
from
her
presence
neither
sound
nor
stir
remembering
of
her
only
that
as
described
by
her
companions
the
pious
ministrants
she
had
said
so
and
so
when
she
had
spoken
at
all
was
she
really
as
she
seemed
so
tremendously
old
so
old
that
her
daughter
our
mother
cousin
helen
and
ours
would
have
had
to
come
to
her
in
middle
life
to
account
for
it
or
did
antiquity
at
that
time
set
in
earlier
and
was
surrender
of
appearance
and
dress
matching
the
intrinsic
decay
only
more
complacent
more
submissive
and
as
who
should
say
more
abject
i
have
my
choice
of
these
suppositions
each
in
its
way
of
so
lively
an
interest
that
i
scarce
know
which
to
prefer
though
inclining
perhaps
a
little
to
the
idea
of
the
backward
reach
if
aunt
wyckoff
was
as
i
first
remember
her
scarce
more
than
seventy
say
the
thought
fills
me
with
one
sort
of
joy
the
joy
of
our
modern
our
so
generally
greater
and
nobler
effect
of
duration
who
more
subtly
strive
for
that
effect
and
intelligently
so
striving
reach
it
better
than
such
of
fate
the
moral
of
whose
case
is
surely
that
if
they
gave
up
too
soon
and
too
softly
we
wiser
witnesses
can
reverse
the
process
and
fight
the
whole
ground
but
i
apologise
to
the
heavy
shade
in
question
if
she
had
really
drained
her
conceivable
cup
and
for
that
matter
rather
like
to
suppose
it
so
rich
and
strange
is
the
pleasure
of
finding
the
past
the
past
above
all
answered
for
to
one
own
touch
this
being
our
only
way
to
be
sure
of
it
it
was
the
past
that
one
touched
in
her
the
american
past
of
a
preponderant
unthinkable
queerness
and
great
would
seem
the
fortune
of
helping
on
the
continuity
at
some
other
far
end
x
it
was
at
all
events
the
good
lady
disappearance
that
more
markedly
cleared
the
decks
cleared
them
for
that
long
slow
sustained
action
with
which
i
make
out
that
nothing
was
afterwards
to
interfere
she
had
sat
there
under
her
stiff
old
father
portrait
with
which
her
own
on
the
other
side
of
the
chimney
mildly
balanced
but
these
presences
acted
from
that
time
but
with
cautious
reserves
a
brave
finished
image
of
such
properties
as
the
in
particular
our
alexander
robertson
a
faint
and
diminished
replica
of
whose
picture
the
really
fine
original
as
i
remember
it
having
been
long
since
perverted
from
our
view
i
lately
renewed
acquaintance
with
in
a
pious
institution
of
his
founding
where
after
more
than
one
push
northward
and
some
easy
accommodations
he
lives
on
into
a
world
that
knows
him
not
and
of
some
of
the
high
improvements
of
which
he
can
little
enough
have
dreamed
of
the
world
he
had
personally
known
there
was
a
feature
or
two
still
extant
the
legend
of
his
acres
and
his
local
concerns
as
well
as
of
his
solid
presence
among
them
was
considerably
cherished
by
us
though
for
ourselves
personally
the
relics
of
his
worth
were
a
lean
feast
to
sit
at
they
were
by
some
invidious
turn
of
fate
all
to
help
to
constitute
the
heritage
of
our
young
kinsman
the
orphaned
and
administered
de
whose
father
alexander
wyckoff
son
of
our
and
one
of
the
two
brothers
of
cousin
helen
just
discernibly
flushes
for
me
through
the
ominous
haze
that
preceded
the
worst
visitation
of
cholera
new
york
was
to
know
alexander
whom
early
widowed
and
a
victim
of
that
visitation
i
evoke
as
with
something
of
a
premature
baldness
of
a
blackness
of
short
whisker
of
an
expanse
of
light
waistcoat
and
of
a
harmless
pomp
of
manner
appeared
to
have
quite
predominantly
come
in
for
the
values
in
question
which
he
promptly
transmitted
to
his
small
motherless
son
and
which
were
destined
so
greatly
to
increase
there
are
clues
i
have
only
lost
not
making
out
in
the
least
why
the
sons
of
aunt
wyckoff
should
have
been
so
happily
distinguished
our
of
the
name
is
even
a
dim
ghost
to
me
he
had
passed
away
beyond
recall
before
i
began
to
take
notice
but
i
hold
rightly
i
feel
that
it
was
not
to
his
person
these
advantages
were
attached
they
could
have
descended
to
our
grandmother
but
in
a
minor
degree
we
should
otherwise
have
been
more
closely
aware
of
them
it
comes
to
me
that
so
far
as
we
had
at
all
been
aware
it
had
mostly
gone
off
in
smoke
i
have
still
in
my
ears
some
rueful
allusion
to
lands
apparently
in
the
general
country
of
the
beaverkill
which
had
come
to
my
mother
and
her
sister
as
their
share
of
their
grandfather
robertson
amplitude
among
the
shares
of
their
four
brothers
only
to
be
sacrificed
later
on
at
some
scant
appraisement
it
is
in
the
nature
of
lands
at
a
distance
and
in
regions
imperfectly
reclaimed
to
be
spoken
of
always
as
immense
and
i
at
any
rate
entertained
the
sense
that
we
should
have
been
great
proprietors
in
the
far
wilderness
if
we
had
only
taken
more
interest
our
interests
were
peculiarly
urban
though
not
indeed
that
this
had
helped
us
much
something
of
the
mystery
of
the
vanished
acres
hung
for
me
about
my
maternal
uncle
john
walsh
the
only
one
who
appeared
to
have
been
in
respect
to
the
dim
possessions
much
on
the
spot
but
i
too
crudely
failed
of
my
chance
of
learning
from
him
what
had
become
of
them
not
that
they
had
seen
poor
gentleman
very
much
further
or
that
i
had
any
strong
sense
of
opportunity
i
catch
at
but
two
or
three
projections
of
him
and
only
at
one
of
his
standing
much
at
his
ease
i
see
him
before
the
fire
in
the
fourteenth
street
library
sturdy
with
straight
black
hair
and
as
if
the
beaverkill
had
rather
stamped
him
but
in
a
stock
and
a
black
i
hear
him
perhaps
still
more
than
i
see
him
deliver
himself
on
the
then
great
subject
of
jenny
lind
whom
he
seemed
to
have
emerged
from
the
wilderness
to
listen
to
and
as
to
whom
i
remember
thinking
it
strange
small
critic
that
i
must
have
begun
to
be
a
note
of
the
wilderness
in
him
that
he
spoke
of
her
as
miss
lind
albeit
i
scarce
know
and
must
even
less
have
known
then
what
other
form
he
could
have
used
the
rest
of
my
sense
of
him
is
tinged
with
the
ancient
pity
that
of
our
so
exercised
response
in
those
years
to
the
general
sad
case
of
uncles
aunts
and
cousins
obscurely
afflicted
the
uncles
in
particular
and
untimely
gathered
sharp
to
me
the
memory
of
a
call
one
dusky
wintry
sunday
afternoon
in
clinton
place
at
the
house
of
my
uncle
robertson
walsh
then
the
head
of
my
mother
family
where
the
hapless
younger
brother
lay
dying
whom
i
was
taken
to
the
top
of
the
house
to
see
and
of
the
sinister
twilight
grimness
of
whose
lot
stretched
there
amid
odours
of
tobacco
and
of
drugs
or
of
some
especial
strong
drug
in
one
of
the
chambers
of
what
i
remember
as
a
remote
and
unfriended
arching
attic
probably
in
fact
the
best
place
of
prescribed
quiet
i
was
to
carry
away
a
fast
impression
all
the
uncles
of
whichever
kindred
were
to
come
to
seem
sooner
or
later
to
be
dying
more
or
less
before
our
eyes
of
melancholy
matters
and
yet
their
general
story
so
far
as
one
could
read
it
appeared
the
story
of
life
i
conceived
at
any
rate
that
john
walsh
celibate
lonely
and
had
been
sacrificed
to
the
robertson
acres
which
on
their
side
had
been
sacrificed
to
i
never
knew
what
the
point
of
my
divagation
however
is
that
the
barmecide
banquet
of
another
tract
of
the
same
was
always
spread
for
us
opposite
the
other
house
from
which
point
it
stretched
on
the
north
side
of
the
street
to
sixth
avenue
though
here
we
were
soon
to
see
it
diminished
at
the
corner
by
a
structure
afterwards
known
to
us
as
our
prosiest
new
york
school
this
edifice
devoted
to
other
uses
but
of
the
same
ample
insignificance
still
left
for
exploitation
at
that
time
an
uncovered
the
transmitted
tale
of
which
was
that
our
greatgrandfather
living
down
near
the
battery
had
had
his
country
villa
or
more
strictly
speaking
his
farm
there
with
free
expanses
roundabout
shrunken
though
the
tract
a
part
of
it
remained
in
particular
a
space
that
i
remember
though
with
the
last
faintness
to
have
seen
appeal
to
the
public
as
a
or
café
a
haunt
of
dance
and
song
and
of
other
forms
of
rather
ineffective
gaiety
the
subsequent
conversion
of
the
site
into
the
premises
of
the
french
theatre
i
was
to
be
able
to
note
more
distinctly
resorting
there
in
the
winter
of
though
not
without
some
wan
detachment
to
a
series
of
more
or
less
exotic
performances
and
admiring
in
especial
the
high
and
hard
virtuosity
of
madame
ristori
the
unfailing
instinct
for
the
wrong
emphasis
of
the
then
acclaimed
rousby
i
still
hear
the
assured
great
woman
great
woman
of
a
knowing
friend
met
as
i
went
out
and
the
stout
fidelity
to
a
losing
game
as
well
as
to
a
truth
not
quite
measurable
among
us
of
the
late
the
but
the
blighted
john
toole
these
are
glimmering
ghosts
though
that
drama
of
the
scene
hard
by
at
which
i
have
glanced
gives
me
back
its
agents
with
a
finer
intensity
for
the
long
action
set
in
as
i
have
hinted
with
the
death
of
aunt
wyckoff
and
if
rather
taking
its
time
at
first
to
develop
maintained
to
the
end
which
was
in
its
full
finality
but
a
few
years
since
the
finest
consistency
and
unity
with
cousin
helen
in
rich
prominence
for
the
heroine
with
the
pale
adventurous
albert
for
the
hero
or
young
protagonist
a
little
indeed
in
the
sense
of
a
small
new
york
orestes
ridden
by
furies
with
a
pair
of
confidants
in
the
form
first
of
the
heroine
highly
respectable
but
quite
negligible
husband
and
second
of
her
close
friend
and
our
own
admirable
aunt
with
alexander
younger
brother
above
all
the
odd
the
eccentric
the
attaching
henry
for
the
stake
as
it
were
of
the
game
so
for
the
spectator
did
the
figures
distribute
themselves
the
three
principal
on
the
large
stage
it
became
a
field
of
such
spreading
interests
well
in
front
and
the
accessory
pair
all
sympathy
and
zeal
prompt
comment
and
rich
resonance
hovering
in
the
background
responsive
to
any
call
and
on
the
spot
at
a
sign
this
most
particularly
true
indeed
of
our
anything
but
detached
aunt
much
less
a
passive
recipient
than
a
vessel
constantly
brimming
and
destined
herself
to
become
the
outstanding
agent
almost
the
ex
in
the
last
act
of
the
story
her
colleague
of
the
earlier
periods
though
to
that
title
she
would
scarce
have
granted
his
right
i
designate
rather
as
our
earnest
husband
than
as
our
kinsman
even
by
courtesy
since
he
was
to
his
own
wife
for
whom
the
dread
of
liberties
taken
in
general
included
even
those
that
might
have
been
allowed
to
herself
he
had
not
in
the
least
like
the
others
in
his
case
married
into
the
cousinship
with
us
and
this
apparently
rather
by
his
defect
than
by
ours
his
christian
name
if
certainly
not
for
use
was
scarce
even
for
ornament
which
consorted
with
the
felt
limits
roundabout
him
of
aids
to
mention
and
with
the
fact
that
no
man
could
on
his
journey
through
life
well
have
been
less
eagerly
designated
or
apostrophised
if
there
are
persons
as
to
whom
the
never
comes
up
at
all
so
there
are
those
as
to
whom
it
never
subsides
but
some
of
them
all
keep
it
by
the
greatness
and
others
oddly
enough
by
the
smallness
of
their
importance
the
subject
of
my
present
reference
as
i
think
of
him
nevertheless
by
which
i
mean
in
spite
of
his
place
in
the
latter
group
greatly
helps
my
documentation
he
must
have
been
of
so
excellent
and
consistent
a
shade
of
nullity
to
that
value
if
value
it
be
there
almost
always
attaches
some
question
of
the
degree
and
the
position
with
adjuncts
with
a
relation
the
zero
may
figure
as
a
numeral
and
the
neglected
zero
is
mostly
for
that
matter
endowed
with
a
consciousness
and
subject
to
irritation
for
this
dim
little
gentleman
so
perfectly
a
gentleman
no
appeal
and
no
redress
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
his
career
were
made
or
entertained
or
projected
no
question
of
how
to
treat
him
or
of
how
might
see
it
or
feel
it
could
ever
possibly
rise
he
was
blank
from
whatever
view
remaining
so
under
application
of
whatever
acid
or
exposure
to
whatever
heat
the
one
identity
he
could
have
was
to
be
part
of
the
consensus
such
a
case
is
rare
that
of
being
no
case
at
all
that
of
not
having
even
the
interest
of
the
grievance
of
not
being
one
we
as
a
rule
catch
glimpses
in
the
of
such
resentments
they
have
at
least
sometimes
the
importance
of
feeling
the
weight
of
our
tread
the
phenomenon
was
here
quite
other
that
of
a
natural
platitude
that
had
never
risen
to
the
level
of
sensibility
when
you
have
been
wronged
you
can
be
righted
when
you
have
suffered
you
can
be
soothed
if
you
have
that
amount
of
grasp
of
the
scene
however
humble
the
drama
of
your
life
to
some
extent
enacts
itself
with
the
logical
consequence
of
your
being
proportionately
its
hero
and
to
be
taken
for
such
let
me
not
dream
of
attempting
to
say
for
what
cousin
helen
took
her
spectral
spouse
though
i
think
it
the
most
marked
touch
in
her
portrait
that
she
kept
us
from
ever
knowing
she
was
a
person
about
whom
you
knew
everything
else
but
there
she
was
genially
inscrutable
and
above
all
claimed
no
damages
on
the
score
of
slights
offered
him
she
knew
nothing
whatever
of
these
yet
could
herself
be
much
wounded
or
hurt
which
latter
word
she
sounded
in
the
wondrous
old
new
york
manner
so
irreducible
to
notation
she
covered
the
whole
case
with
a
mantle
which
was
yet
much
more
probably
that
of
her
real
simplicity
than
of
a
feigned
unconsciousness
i
doubt
whether
she
that
men
could
be
amiable
in
a
different
manner
from
that
which
had
to
serve
her
for
supposing
her
husband
amiable
when
the
mould
and
the
men
cast
in
it
were
very
different
she
failed
or
at
least
she
feared
to
conclude
to
amiability
though
women
as
different
themselves
as
such
stranger
men
might
take
it
for
that
directly
interrogated
she
might
such
was
the
innocence
of
these
manners
have
approved
of
male
society
in
stronger
doses
or
more
vivid
hues
save
where
consanguinity
or
indeed
relationship
by
marriage
to
which
she
greatly
deferred
had
honestly
imposed
it
the
singular
thing
for
the
drama
to
which
i
return
was
that
there
it
was
just
consanguinity
that
had
made
the
burden
difficult
and
strange
and
of
a
nature
to
call
on
great
decisions
and
patient
plans
even
though
the
most
ominous
possibilities
were
not
involved
i
reconstruct
and
reconstruct
of
course
but
the
elements
had
to
my
childish
vision
at
least
nothing
at
all
portentous
if
any
light
of
the
lurid
played
in
for
me
just
a
little
it
was
but
under
much
later
information
what
my
childish
vision
was
really
most
possessed
of
i
think
was
the
figure
of
the
spectral
spouse
the
dim
little
gentleman
as
i
have
called
him
pacing
the
whole
length
of
the
two
big
parlours
in
prolonged
repetition
much
as
if
they
had
been
the
deck
of
one
of
those
ships
anciently
haunted
by
him
as
supercargo
or
whatever
in
strange
far
seas
according
to
the
only
legend
connected
with
him
save
that
of
his
early
presumption
in
having
approached
such
as
he
was
so
fine
a
young
woman
and
his
remarkable
luck
in
having
approached
her
successfully
a
luck
surprisingly
renewed
for
him
since
it
was
also
part
of
the
legend
that
he
had
previously
married
and
lost
a
bride
beyond
his
deserts
xi
i
am
strictly
speaking
at
this
point
on
a
visit
to
albert
who
at
times
sociably
condescended
to
my
fewer
years
i
still
appreciate
the
ease
of
it
but
my
host
seems
for
the
minute
to
have
left
me
and
i
am
attached
but
to
the
rich
perspective
in
which
uncle
for
albert
too
he
was
only
all
namelessly
uncle
comes
and
goes
out
of
the
comparative
high
brownness
of
the
back
room
commanding
brave
extensions
as
i
thought
them
a
covered
piazza
over
which
in
season
isabella
grapes
accessibly
clustered
and
beyond
which
stretched
further
a
yard
that
was
as
an
ample
garden
compared
to
ours
at
home
i
keep
in
view
his
little
rounded
back
at
the
base
of
which
his
arms
are
interlocked
behind
him
and
i
know
how
his
bald
head
yet
with
the
hair
bristling
up
almost
in
fashion
at
the
sides
is
thrust
inquiringly
not
to
say
appealingly
forward
i
assist
at
his
emergence
where
the
fine
old
mahogany
doors
of
separation
are
rolled
back
on
what
used
to
seem
to
me
silver
wheels
into
the
brighter
yet
colder
half
of
the
scene
and
attend
him
while
he
at
last
looks
out
awhile
into
fourteenth
street
for
news
of
whatever
may
be
remarkably
objectionably
or
mercifully
taking
place
there
and
then
i
await
his
regular
return
preparatory
to
a
renewed
advance
far
from
indifferent
as
i
innocently
am
to
his
discoveries
or
his
comments
it
is
cousin
helen
however
who
preferentially
takes
them
up
attaching
to
them
the
right
importance
which
is
for
the
moment
the
very
greatest
that
could
possibly
be
attached
to
anything
in
the
world
i
for
my
part
occupied
with
those
marks
of
character
in
our
pacing
companion
his
long
slightly
equine
countenance
his
eyebrows
ever
elevated
as
in
the
curiosity
of
alarm
and
the
so
limited
play
from
side
to
side
of
his
extremely
protrusive
head
as
if
somehow
through
tightness
of
the
wash
neckcloths
that
he
habitually
wore
and
that
wound
and
in
their
successive
stages
made
his
neck
very
long
without
making
it
in
the
least
thick
and
reached
their
climax
in
a
proportionately
very
small
knot
tied
with
the
neatest
art
i
scarce
can
have
known
at
the
time
that
this
was
as
complete
a
little
figure
as
any
that
might
then
have
been
noted
there
far
or
near
yet
if
i
did
somehow
subtly
feel
it
why
am
i
now
so
convinced
that
i
must
have
had
familiarly
before
me
a
masterpiece
of
the
great
daumier
say
or
henri
monnier
or
any
other
then
contemporary
projector
of
monsieur
prudhomme
the
timorous
philistine
in
a
world
of
dangers
with
whom
i
was
later
on
to
make
acquaintance
i
put
myself
the
question
of
scant
importance
though
it
may
seem
but
there
is
a
reflection
perhaps
more
timely
than
any
answer
to
it
i
catch
myself
in
the
act
of
seeing
poor
anonymous
dear
as
cousin
helen
confined
herself
her
life
long
to
calling
him
in
the
light
of
an
image
arrested
by
the
french
genius
and
this
in
truth
opens
up
vistas
i
scarce
know
what
it
suggest
for
the
fact
of
sharpness
of
intensity
of
type
which
fact
in
turn
leads
my
imagination
almost
any
dance
making
me
ask
myself
quite
most
of
all
whether
a
person
so
marked
by
it
must
really
have
been
a
highly
finished
figure
that
degree
of
finish
was
surely
rare
among
us
rare
at
a
time
when
the
charm
of
so
much
of
the
cousinship
and
the
uncleship
the
kinship
generally
had
to
be
found
in
their
so
engagingly
dispensing
with
any
finish
at
all
they
happened
to
be
amiable
to
be
delightful
but
i
think
i
have
already
put
the
question
what
would
have
become
of
us
all
if
they
had
been
a
question
the
shudder
of
which
could
never
have
been
suggested
by
the
presence
i
am
considering
he
too
was
gentle
and
bland
as
it
happened
and
i
indeed
see
it
all
as
a
world
quite
unfavourable
to
arrogance
or
insolence
or
any
hard
and
high
assumption
but
the
more
i
think
of
him
even
at
the
risk
of
thinking
too
much
the
more
i
make
out
in
him
a
tone
and
a
manner
that
deprecated
crude
ease
plenty
of
this
was
already
in
the
air
but
if
he
had
so
spoken
of
an
order
in
which
forms
still
counted
it
might
scarce
have
occurred
to
one
that
there
had
ever
been
any
it
comes
over
me
therefore
that
he
testified
and
perhaps
quite
beautifully
i
remember
his
voice
and
his
speech
which
were
not
those
of
new
york
at
all
and
with
the
echo
faint
as
it
is
arrives
the
wonder
of
where
he
could
possibly
have
picked
such
things
up
they
were
as
forms
adjusted
and
settled
things
from
what
finer
civilisation
therefore
had
they
come
down
to
him
to
brood
on
this
the
least
little
bit
is
verily
as
i
have
said
to
open
up
vistas
out
of
the
depths
of
one
of
which
fairly
glimmers
the
queerest
of
questions
may
we
accordingly
have
been
the
rest
of
us
all
wrong
and
the
dim
little
gentleman
the
only
one
among
us
who
was
right
may
not
his
truth
to
type
have
been
a
matter
that
as
mostly
typeless
ourselves
we
neither
perceived
nor
appreciated
so
that
if
as
is
conceivable
he
felt
and
measured
the
situation
and
simply
chose
to
be
bland
and
quiet
and
keep
his
sense
to
himself
he
was
a
hero
without
the
laurel
as
well
as
a
martyr
without
the
crown
the
light
of
which
possibility
is
however
too
fierce
i
turn
it
off
i
tear
myself
from
the
view
noting
further
but
the
one
fact
in
his
history
that
by
my
glimpse
of
it
quite
escapes
ambiguity
the
youthful
albert
i
have
mentioned
was
to
resist
successfully
through
those
years
that
solicitation
of
europe
our
own
response
to
which
both
as
a
general
and
a
particular
solution
kept
breaking
out
in
choral
wails
but
the
other
house
none
the
less
nourished
projects
so
earnest
that
they
could
invoke
the
dignity
of
comparative
silence
and
patience
the
other
house
did
aspire
to
the
tongues
but
it
aspired
to
the
grand
tour
of
which
ours
was
on
many
grounds
incapable
only
after
years
and
when
endless
things
had
happened
albert
having
long
before
in
especial
quite
taken
up
his
stake
and
ostensibly
dropped
out
of
the
game
did
the
great
adventure
get
itself
enacted
with
the
effect
of
one
of
the
liveliest
illustrations
of
the
irony
of
fate
what
had
most
of
all
flushed
through
the
dream
of
it
during
years
was
the
legend
at
last
quite
antediluvian
of
the
dim
little
gentleman
early
wanderjahre
that
experience
of
distant
lands
and
seas
which
would
find
an
application
none
the
less
lively
for
having
had
long
to
wait
it
had
had
to
wait
in
truth
half
a
century
yet
its
confidence
had
apparently
not
been
impaired
when
new
york
on
the
happy
day
began
to
recede
from
view
europe
had
surprises
none
the
less
and
who
knows
to
what
extent
it
may
after
half
a
century
have
had
shocks
the
coming
true
of
the
old
dream
produced
at
any
rate
a
snap
of
the
tense
cord
and
the
ancient
worthy
my
imagination
has
in
the
tenderest
of
intentions
thus
played
with
disembarked
in
england
only
to
indulge
in
the
last
of
his
startled
stares
only
to
look
about
him
in
vague
deprecation
and
give
it
all
up
he
just
landed
and
died
but
the
grand
tour
was
none
the
less
proceeded
with
cousin
helen
herself
aided
by
resources
personal
social
and
financial
that
left
nothing
to
desire
triumphantly
performed
it
though
as
with
a
feeling
of
delicacy
about
it
firmly
overcome
but
it
has
taken
me
quite
out
of
the
other
house
so
that
i
patch
up
again
at
a
stroke
that
early
scene
of
her
double
guardianship
at
which
my
small
wonder
assisted
it
even
then
glimmered
on
me
i
think
that
if
albert
was
all
so
romantically
in
charge
of
his
aunt
which
was
a
perfectly
nondescript
relation
so
his
uncle
henry
her
odd
brother
was
her
more
or
less
legal
ward
not
less
despite
his
being
so
very
much
albert
senior
in
these
facts
and
in
the
character
of
each
of
the
three
persons
involved
resided
the
drama
which
must
more
or
less
have
begun
as
i
have
hinted
when
henry
at
a
date
i
seem
to
have
seized
definitely
emerged
from
rustication
the
beaverkill
had
but
for
a
certain
term
protected
or
promoted
his
simplicity
and
began
on
his
side
to
pace
the
field
between
the
fourteenth
street
windows
and
the
piazza
of
the
isabella
grapes
i
see
him
there
less
vividly
than
his
only
because
he
was
afterwards
to
loom
so
much
larger
whereas
his
companion
even
while
still
present
was
weakly
to
shrink
and
fade
at
this
late
day
only
do
i
devise
for
that
companion
a
possible
history
the
henry
annals
on
the
other
hand
grew
in
interest
as
soon
as
they
became
interesting
at
all
this
happened
as
soon
as
one
took
in
the
ground
and
some
of
the
features
of
his
tutelage
the
basis
of
it
all
was
that
harmless
as
he
appeared
he
was
not
to
be
trusted
i
remember
how
portentous
that
truth
soon
looked
both
in
the
light
of
his
intense
amiability
and
of
sister
helen
absolute
certitude
he
was
to
be
trusted
it
was
the
sole
very
definite
fact
about
him
except
the
fact
that
he
had
so
kindly
come
down
from
the
beaverkill
to
regale
us
with
the
perfect
demonstration
dutifully
resignedly
setting
himself
among
us
to
point
the
whole
moral
himself
he
appeared
from
the
moment
we
really
took
it
in
to
be
doing
in
the
matter
no
more
than
he
ought
he
exposed
himself
to
our
invidious
gaze
on
this
ground
with
a
humility
a
quiet
courtesy
and
an
instinctive
dignity
that
come
back
to
me
as
simply
heroic
he
had
himself
accepted
under
strenuous
suggestion
the
dreadful
view
and
i
see
him
in
the
light
of
the
grand
dénouement
deferred
for
long
years
but
fairly
dazzling
when
it
came
as
fairly
sublime
in
his
decision
not
to
put
anyone
in
the
wrong
about
him
a
day
sooner
than
he
could
possibly
help
the
whole
circle
of
us
would
in
that
event
be
so
dreadfully
sold
as
to
our
wisdom
and
justice
he
proving
only
noble
and
exquisite
it
did
so
immensely
matter
to
him
as
that
the
establishment
of
his
true
character
did
so
he
went
on
as
if
for
all
the
years
and
they
really
piled
themselves
up
his
passing
for
a
dangerous
idiot
or
at
least
for
a
slave
of
his
passions
from
the
moment
he
was
allowed
the
wherewithal
in
the
least
to
indulge
them
was
a
less
evil
for
him
than
seeing
us
rudely
corrected
it
was
in
truth
an
extraordinary
situation
and
would
have
offered
a
splendid
subject
as
we
used
to
say
to
the
painter
of
character
the
novelist
or
the
dramatist
with
the
hand
to
treat
it
after
i
had
read
david
copperfield
an
analogy
glimmered
it
struck
me
even
in
the
early
time
cousin
henry
was
more
or
less
another
dick
just
as
cousin
helen
was
in
her
relation
to
him
more
or
less
another
miss
trotwood
there
were
disparities
indeed
dick
was
the
harmless
lunatic
on
that
lady
premises
but
she
admired
him
and
appealed
to
him
lunatics
in
her
generous
view
might
be
oracles
and
there
is
no
evidence
if
i
correctly
remember
that
she
kept
him
low
our
dick
was
suffered
to
indulge
his
passions
but
on
ten
cents
a
day
while
his
fortune
under
conscientious
under
admirable
care
cousin
helen
being
no
less
the
wise
and
keen
woman
of
business
than
the
devoted
sister
rolled
up
and
became
large
likewise
miss
trotwood
inmate
had
at
all
the
perplexed
brooding
brow
with
the
troubled
fold
in
it
that
represented
poor
henry
only
form
of
criticism
of
adverse
fate
they
had
alike
the
large
smooth
open
countenance
of
those
for
whom
life
has
been
simplified
and
if
dick
had
had
a
fortune
he
would
have
remained
all
his
days
as
modestly
vague
about
the
figure
of
it
as
our
relative
consented
to
remain
the
latter
interests
were
agricultural
while
his
predecessor
as
we
remember
were
mainly
historical
each
at
any
rate
had
in
a
general
way
his
miss
trotwood
not
to
say
his
sister
helen
the
good
henry
miss
trotwood
lived
and
died
without
an
visitation
of
doubt
as
to
the
due
exercise
of
her
authority
as
to
what
would
happen
if
it
faltered
her
victim
waiting
in
the
handsomest
manner
till
she
had
passed
away
to
show
us
all
all
who
remained
after
so
long
to
do
him
justice
that
nothing
but
what
was
charming
and
touching
could
possibly
happen
this
was
in
part
at
least
the
dazzling
dénouement
i
have
spoken
of
he
became
as
soon
as
fortunate
dispositions
could
take
effect
the
care
of
our
admirable
aunt
between
whom
and
his
sister
and
himself
close
cousinship
from
far
back
had
practically
amounted
to
sisterhood
by
which
time
the
other
house
had
long
been
another
house
altogether
its
ancient
site
relinquished
its
contents
planted
afresh
far
northward
with
new
traditions
invoked
though
with
that
of
its
great
friendliness
to
all
of
us
for
our
mother
sake
still
confirmed
here
with
brief
brightness
clouded
at
the
very
last
the
solution
emerged
we
became
aware
not
without
embarrassment
that
poor
henry
at
large
and
supplied
with
funds
was
exactly
as
harmless
and
blameless
as
poor
henry
stinted
and
captive
as
to
which
if
anything
had
been
wanting
to
our
confusion
or
to
his
own
dignity
it
would
have
been
his
supreme
abstinence
his
suppression
of
the
least
did
i
tell
you
he
did
even
pretend
to
have
told
us
when
he
so
abundantly
might
and
nothing
could
exceed
the
grace
with
which
he
appeared
to
have
noticed
nothing
he
handled
dollars
as
decently
and
just
as
profusely
as
he
had
handled
dimes
the
only
light
shade
on
the
scene
except
of
course
for
its
being
so
belated
which
did
make
it
pathetically
dim
was
the
question
of
how
nearly
he
at
all
measured
his
resources
not
his
heart
but
his
imagination
in
the
long
years
had
been
starved
and
though
he
was
now
all
discreetly
and
wisely
encouraged
to
feel
rich
it
was
rather
sadly
visible
that
thanks
to
almost
half
a
century
of
he
failed
quite
to
rise
to
his
estate
he
did
feel
rich
just
as
he
felt
generous
the
misfortune
was
only
in
his
weak
sense
for
meanings
that
with
the
whole
situation
made
delicacy
of
the
first
importance
as
indeed
what
was
perhaps
most
striking
in
the
entire
connection
was
the
part
played
by
delicacy
from
the
first
it
had
all
been
a
drama
of
the
delicate
the
consummately
scrupulous
and
successful
administration
of
his
resources
for
the
benefit
of
his
virtue
so
that
they
could
be
handed
over
in
the
event
without
the
leakage
of
a
fraction
what
was
that
but
a
triumph
of
delicacy
so
delicacy
conspired
delicacy
surrounded
him
the
case
having
been
from
the
early
time
that
could
he
only
be
regarded
as
sufficiently
responsible
could
the
sources
of
his
bounty
be
judged
fairly
open
to
light
pressure
there
was
question
of
none
but
the
lightest
that
bounty
might
blessedly
flow
this
had
been
miss
trotwood
own
enlightened
view
on
behalf
of
one
of
the
oddest
and
most
appealing
collections
of
wistful
wondering
single
gentlewomen
that
a
great
calculating
benevolence
perhaps
ever
found
arrayed
before
it
ornaments
these
all
of
the
second
and
third
cousinship
and
interested
spectators
of
the
almost
inexpressible
facts
i
should
have
liked
completely
to
express
them
in
spite
of
the
difficulty
if
not
indeed
just
by
reason
of
that
the
difficulty
of
their
consisting
so
much
more
of
character
than
of
incident
heaven
save
the
artless
opposition
though
this
last
element
figured
bravely
enough
too
thanks
to
some
of
the
forms
taken
by
our
young
albert
wild
wilfulness
he
was
so
weak
after
the
most
approved
fashion
of
distressing
young
men
of
means
that
his
successive
exhibitions
of
it
had
a
fine
high
positive
effect
such
as
would
have
served
beautifully
act
after
act
for
the
descent
of
the
curtain
the
issue
however
differing
in
this
from
the
common
theatrical
trick
depended
less
on
who
should
die
than
on
who
should
live
the
younger
of
cousin
pair
of
wards
putting
them
even
only
as
vessels
of
her
attempted
earnestness
had
violently
broken
away
but
a
remedy
to
this
grief
for
reasons
too
many
to
tell
dwelt
in
the
possible
duration
could
it
only
not
be
arrested
of
two
other
lives
one
of
these
her
own
the
second
the
guileless
henry
the
single
gentlewomen
to
a
remarkable
number
whom
she
regarded
and
treated
as
nieces
though
they
were
only
daughters
of
cousins
were
such
objects
of
her
tender
solicitude
that
she
and
henry
and
albert
being
alike
childless
the
delightful
thing
to
think
of
was
on
certain
contingencies
the
nieces
prospective
wealth
there
were
contingencies
of
course
and
they
exactly
produced
the
pity
and
terror
her
estate
would
go
at
her
death
to
her
nearest
of
kin
represented
by
her
brother
and
nephew
it
would
be
only
of
her
savings
fortunately
with
her
kind
eye
on
the
gentlewomen
zealous
and
long
continued
that
she
might
dispose
by
will
and
it
was
but
a
troubled
comfort
that
should
he
be
living
at
the
time
of
her
death
the
susceptible
henry
would
profit
no
less
than
the
wanton
albert
henry
was
at
any
cost
to
be
kept
in
life
that
he
profit
the
woeful
question
the
question
of
delicacy
for
a
woman
devoutly
conscientious
was
how
could
anyone
else
how
above
all
could
fifteen
other
persons
be
made
to
profit
by
his
profiting
she
had
been
as
earnest
a
steward
of
her
brother
fortune
as
if
directness
of
pressure
on
him
in
a
sense
favourable
to
her
interests
that
is
to
her
sympathies
which
were
her
only
interests
had
been
a
matter
of
course
with
her
whereas
in
fact
she
would
have
held
it
a
crime
given
his
simplicity
to
attempt
in
the
least
to
guide
his
hand
if
he
did
outlive
his
nephew
and
he
was
older
though
as
would
appear
so
much
more
virtuous
his
inherited
property
she
being
dead
would
accrue
to
that
unedifying
person
was
the
pity
and
as
for
the
question
of
the
disposition
of
henry
savings
without
the
initiative
of
henry
intelligence
in
that
alas
was
the
terror
henry
savings
there
had
been
no
terror
for
her
naturally
in
beautifully
husbanding
his
resources
him
dangled
naturally
with
no
small
vividness
before
the
wistful
gentlewomen
to
whom
if
he
had
but
the
initiative
he
might
have
made
the
most
princely
presents
such
was
the
oddity
not
to
say
the
rather
tragic
drollery
of
the
situation
that
henry
idea
of
a
present
was
ten
cents
worth
of
popcorn
or
some
similar
homely
trifle
and
that
when
one
had
created
for
him
a
world
of
these
proportions
there
was
no
honest
way
of
inspiring
him
to
write
cheques
for
hundreds
all
congruous
though
these
would
be
with
the
generosity
of
his
nature
as
shown
by
the
exuberance
of
his
popcorn
the
ideal
solution
would
be
his
flashing
to
intelligence
just
long
enough
to
apprehend
the
case
and
of
his
own
magnanimous
movement
sign
away
everything
but
that
was
a
stroke
and
the
fairies
here
somehow
stood
off
thus
between
the
wealth
of
her
earnestness
and
the
poverty
of
her
courage
her
dread
that
is
of
exposing
herself
to
a
legal
process
for
undue
influence
our
good
lady
was
not
at
peace
or
to
be
exact
was
only
at
such
peace
as
came
to
her
by
the
free
bestowal
of
her
own
accumulations
during
her
lifetime
and
after
her
death
she
predeceased
her
brother
and
had
the
pang
of
feeling
that
if
half
her
residuum
would
be
deplorably
diverted
the
other
half
would
be
by
the
same
stroke
imperfectly
applied
the
artless
henry
remained
at
once
so
well
provided
and
so
dimly
inspired
here
was
suspense
indeed
for
a
last
curtain
but
one
and
my
fancy
glows
all
expertly
for
the
disclosure
of
the
final
scene
than
which
nothing
could
well
have
been
happier
on
all
the
premises
save
for
a
single
flaw
the
installation
in
street
of
our
admirable
aunt
often
through
the
later
years
domiciled
there
but
now
settled
to
community
of
life
with
a
touching
charge
and
representing
near
him
his
extinguished
extinguished
sister
the
too
few
years
that
followed
were
the
good
man
indian
summer
and
a
very
wonderful
time
so
charmingly
it
shone
forth
for
all
concerned
that
he
was
a
person
fitted
to
adorn
as
the
phrase
is
almost
any
position
our
admirable
aunt
not
less
devoted
and
less
disinterested
than
his
former
protectress
had
yet
much
more
imagination
she
had
enough
in
a
word
for
perfect
confidence
and
under
confidence
what
remained
of
poor
henry
life
bloomed
like
a
garden
freshly
watered
sad
alas
the
fact
that
so
scant
a
patch
was
now
left
it
sufficed
however
and
he
rose
just
in
time
to
every
conception
it
was
as
i
have
already
noted
as
if
he
had
all
the
while
known
as
if
he
had
really
been
a
conscious
victim
to
the
superstition
of
his
blackness
his
final
companion
recognised
as
it
were
his
powers
and
it
may
be
imagined
whether
when
he
absolutely
himself
proposed
to
benefit
the
gentlewomen
she
passed
him
or
not
the
blessed
pen
he
had
taken
a
year
or
two
to
publish
by
his
behaviour
the
perfection
of
his
civility
and
so
on
that
safe
ground
made
use
of
the
pen
his
competence
was
afterwards
attacked
and
it
emerged
triumphant
exactly
as
his
perfect
charity
and
humility
and
amenity
and
his
long
inward
loneliness
of
half
a
century
did
he
had
bowed
his
head
and
sometimes
softly
scratched
it
during
that
immense
period
he
had
occasionally
after
roaming
downstairs
with
the
troubled
fold
in
his
brow
and
the
difficult
the
smothered
statement
on
his
lips
his
vocabulary
was
scant
and
stiff
the
vocabulary
of
pleading
explanation
often
found
too
complicated
by
the
witty
retired
once
more
to
his
room
sometimes
indeed
for
hours
to
think
it
all
over
again
but
had
never
failed
of
sobriety
or
propriety
or
punctuality
or
regularity
never
failed
of
one
of
the
virtues
his
imputed
indifference
to
which
had
been
the
ground
of
his
discipline
it
was
very
extraordinary
and
of
all
the
stories
i
know
is
i
think
the
most
beautiful
so
far
at
least
as
was
concerned
the
flaw
i
have
mentioned
the
one
break
in
the
final
harmony
was
the
death
of
our
admirable
aunt
too
soon
shortly
before
his
own
and
while
taken
with
illness
at
the
same
time
he
lay
there
deprived
of
her
attention
he
had
that
of
the
gentlewomen
however
two
or
three
of
the
wisest
and
tenderest
being
deputed
by
the
others
and
if
his
original
estate
reverted
at
law
they
presently
none
the
less
had
occasion
to
bless
his
name
xii
i
turn
round
again
to
where
i
last
left
myself
gaping
at
the
old
ricketty
in
fifth
avenue
and
am
almost
as
sharply
aware
as
ever
of
the
main
source
of
its
spell
the
fact
that
it
most
often
blazed
with
the
rich
appeal
of
barnum
whose
attached
to
the
great
american
museum
overflowed
into
posters
of
all
the
theatrical
bravery
disavowed
by
its
title
it
was
my
rueful
theory
of
those
days
though
tasteful
i
may
call
it
too
as
well
as
rueful
that
on
all
the
holidays
on
which
we
were
dragged
to
the
dentist
we
attended
as
a
matter
of
course
at
barnum
that
is
when
we
were
so
happy
as
to
be
able
to
which
to
my
own
particular
consciousness
was
every
time
the
case
the
case
was
too
often
to
my
melancholy
view
that
quite
regularly
on
the
saturdays
repaired
to
this
seat
of
joy
with
the
easy
albert
at
home
there
and
master
of
the
scene
to
a
degree
at
which
somehow
neither
of
us
could
at
the
best
arrive
he
quite
moulded
truly
in
those
years
of
plasticity
as
to
the
æsthetic
bent
and
the
determination
of
curiosity
i
seem
to
make
out
by
the
general
barnum
association
and
revelation
it
was
not
i
hasten
to
add
that
i
too
did
to
the
extent
of
my
minor
chance
drink
at
the
spring
for
how
else
should
i
have
come
by
the
whole
undimmed
sense
of
the
connection
the
weary
waiting
in
the
dusty
halls
of
humbug
amid
bottled
mermaids
bearded
ladies
and
chill
dioramas
for
the
the
true
centre
of
the
seat
of
joy
to
open
vivid
in
especial
to
me
is
my
almost
sick
wondering
of
whether
i
might
be
rapt
away
before
it
did
open
the
impression
appears
to
have
been
mixed
the
drinking
deep
and
the
holding
out
holding
out
in
particular
against
failure
of
food
and
of
provision
for
transport
to
and
fro
being
questions
equally
intense
the
appeal
of
the
in
its
essence
a
heavy
extra
so
exhausted
our
resources
that
even
the
sustaining
doughnut
of
the
would
mock
our
desire
and
the
long
homeward
crawl
the
length
of
broadway
and
further
seem
to
defy
repetition
those
desperate
days
none
the
less
affect
me
now
as
having
flushed
with
the
very
complexion
of
romance
their
aches
and
inanitions
were
part
of
the
adventure
the
homeward
straggle
interminable
as
it
appeared
flowered
at
moments
into
rapt
contemplations
that
for
instance
of
the
painted
portrait
large
as
life
of
the
celebrity
of
the
hour
then
dancing
at
the
broadway
theatre
lola
montes
countess
of
lansfeldt
of
a
dazzling
and
unreal
beauty
and
in
a
lavishly
open
at
the
throat
it
was
thus
quite
in
order
that
i
should
pore
longest
there
at
my
fondest
corner
over
the
barnum
announcements
my
present
inability
to
be
superficial
about
which
has
given
in
fact
the
measure
of
my
contemporary
care
these
announcements
must
have
been
in
their
way
marvels
of
attractive
composition
the
placard
bristling
from
top
to
toe
with
its
analytic
synopsis
of
scenery
and
incidents
the
synoptical
view
cast
its
net
of
fine
meshes
and
the
very
word
savoured
of
incantation
it
is
odd
at
the
same
time
that
when
i
question
memory
as
to
the
living
hours
themselves
those
of
the
stuffed
and
dim
little
hall
of
audience
smelling
of
peppermint
and
where
the
curtain
rose
on
our
gasping
but
rewarded
patience
two
performances
only
stand
out
for
me
though
these
in
the
highest
relief
love
or
the
countess
and
the
serf
by
sheridan
knowles
i
see
that
still
as
the
blazonry
of
one
of
them
just
as
i
see
miss
emily
mestayer
large
red
in
the
face
coifed
in
a
tangle
of
small
fine
short
curls
and
clad
in
a
garment
edged
with
shout
at
the
top
of
her
lungs
that
a
of
gold
would
be
the
fair
guerdon
of
the
minion
who
should
start
on
the
spot
to
do
her
bidding
at
some
desperate
crisis
that
i
forget
i
forget
huon
the
serf
whom
i
yet
recall
immensely
admiring
for
his
nobleness
i
forget
everyone
but
miss
mestayer
who
gave
form
to
my
conception
of
the
tragic
actress
at
her
highest
she
had
a
hooked
nose
a
great
play
of
nostril
a
vast
protuberance
of
bosom
and
always
the
crop
of
close
moist
ringlets
i
say
always
for
i
was
to
see
her
often
again
during
a
much
later
phase
the
years
of
that
boston
museum
which
aimed
at
so
vastly
higher
a
distinction
than
the
exploded
had
really
done
though
in
an
age
that
snickered
even
abnormally
low
it
still
lacked
the
courage
to
call
itself
a
theatre
she
must
have
been
in
comedy
which
i
believe
she
also
usefully
and
fearlessly
practised
rather
unimaginable
but
there
was
no
one
like
her
in
the
boston
time
for
cursing
queens
and
mothers
the
shakespeare
of
the
booths
and
other
such
would
have
been
unproducible
without
her
she
had
a
rusty
rasping
heaving
and
tossing
authority
of
which
the
bitterness
is
still
in
my
ears
i
am
revisited
by
an
outer
glimpse
of
her
in
that
after
age
when
she
had
come
comparatively
speaking
into
her
own
the
sight
of
her
accidentally
incurred
one
tremendously
hot
summer
night
as
she
slowly
moved
from
her
lodgings
or
wherever
in
the
high
bowdoin
street
region
down
to
the
not
distant
theatre
from
which
even
the
temperature
had
given
her
no
reprieve
and
well
remember
how
the
queer
light
of
my
young
impression
playing
up
again
in
her
path
she
struck
me
as
the
very
image
of
mere
sore
histrionic
habit
and
use
a
worn
and
weary
a
battered
even
though
almost
sordidly
smoothed
of
the
theatre
very
much
as
an
old
and
greasy
violoncello
of
the
orchestra
might
have
been
it
was
but
an
effect
doubtless
of
the
heat
that
she
scarcely
seemed
clad
at
all
slippered
shuffling
and
though
somehow
hatted
and
vaguely
veiled
or
streamered
wrapt
in
a
gauzy
sketch
of
a
she
pointed
to
my
extravagant
attention
the
moral
of
thankless
personal
service
of
the
reverse
of
the
picture
of
the
cost
of
amusing
the
public
in
a
case
of
amusing
it
as
who
should
say
every
hour
and
i
had
thrilled
before
her
as
the
countess
in
love
such
contrasted
combinations
but
she
carried
her
head
very
high
as
with
the
habit
of
crowns
and
trains
and
tirades
had
in
fact
much
the
air
of
some
deposed
and
reduced
sovereign
living
on
a
scant
allowance
so
that
all
invisibly
and
compassionately
i
took
off
my
hat
to
her
to
which
i
must
add
the
other
of
my
two
barnumite
scenic
memories
my
having
anciently
admired
her
as
the
eliza
of
uncle
tom
cabin
her
swelling
bust
encased
in
a
neat
cotton
gown
and
her
flight
across
the
of
the
ohio
if
i
rightly
remember
the
perilous
stream
intrepidly
and
gracefully
performed
we
lived
and
moved
at
that
time
with
great
intensity
in
stowe
novel
which
recalling
my
prompt
and
charmed
acquaintance
with
it
i
should
perhaps
substitute
for
the
initials
earlier
mentioned
here
as
my
first
experiment
in
fiction
there
was
however
i
think
for
that
triumphant
work
no
classified
condition
it
was
for
no
sort
of
reader
as
distinct
from
any
other
sort
save
indeed
for
northern
as
differing
from
southern
it
knew
the
large
felicity
of
gathering
in
alike
the
small
and
the
simple
and
the
big
and
the
wise
and
had
above
all
the
extraordinary
fortune
of
finding
itself
for
an
immense
number
of
people
much
less
a
book
than
a
state
of
vision
of
feeling
and
of
consciousness
in
which
they
sit
and
read
and
appraise
and
pass
the
time
but
walked
and
talked
and
laughed
and
cried
and
in
a
manner
of
which
stowe
was
the
irresistible
cause
generally
conducted
themselves
appreciation
and
judgment
the
whole
impression
were
thus
an
effect
for
which
there
had
been
no
process
any
process
so
related
having
in
other
cases
to
be
at
some
point
or
other
critical
nothing
in
the
guise
of
a
written
book
therefore
a
book
printed
published
sold
bought
and
noticed
probably
ever
reached
its
mark
the
mark
of
exciting
interest
without
having
at
least
groped
for
that
goal
a
book
or
by
the
exposure
of
some
literary
side
letters
here
languished
unconscious
and
uncle
tom
instead
of
making
even
one
of
the
cheap
short
cuts
through
the
medium
in
which
books
breathe
even
as
fishes
in
water
went
gaily
roundabout
it
altogether
as
if
a
fish
a
wonderful
leaping
fish
had
simply
flown
through
the
air
this
feat
accomplished
the
surprising
creature
could
naturally
fly
anywhere
and
one
of
the
first
things
it
did
was
thus
to
flutter
down
on
every
stage
literally
without
exception
in
america
and
europe
if
the
amount
of
life
represented
in
such
a
work
is
measurable
by
the
ease
with
which
representation
is
taken
up
and
carried
further
carried
even
violently
furthest
the
fate
of
stowe
picture
was
conclusive
it
simply
sat
down
wherever
it
lighted
and
made
itself
so
to
speak
at
home
thither
multitudes
flocked
afresh
and
there
in
each
case
it
rose
to
its
height
again
and
went
with
all
its
vivacity
and
good
faith
through
all
its
motions
these
latter
were
to
leave
me
however
with
a
fonder
vision
still
than
that
of
the
comparatively
jejune
version
for
the
first
exhibition
of
them
to
spring
to
the
front
was
the
fine
free
rendering
achieved
at
a
playhouse
till
then
ignored
by
fashion
and
culture
the
national
theatre
deep
down
on
the
east
side
whence
echoes
had
come
faintest
to
ears
polite
but
where
a
sincerity
vivid
though
rude
was
now
supposed
to
reward
the
curious
our
numerous
attendance
there
under
this
spell
was
my
first
experience
of
the
theatre
party
as
we
have
enjoyed
it
in
our
time
each
emotion
and
impression
of
which
is
as
fresh
to
me
as
the
most
recent
of
the
same
family
precious
through
all
indeed
perhaps
is
the
sense
strange
only
to
later
sophistication
of
my
small
encouraged
state
as
a
free
playgoer
a
state
doubly
wondrous
while
i
thus
evoke
the
full
contingent
from
union
square
where
for
that
matter
i
think
the
wild
evening
must
have
been
planned
i
am
lost
again
in
all
the
goodnature
from
which
small
boys
on
wild
evenings
could
dangle
so
unchidden
since
the
state
of
unchiddenness
is
what
comes
back
to
me
clearest
how
without
that
complacency
of
conscience
could
every
felt
impression
so
live
again
it
is
true
that
for
my
present
sense
of
the
matter
snubs
and
raps
would
still
tingle
would
count
double
just
wherefore
it
is
exactly
however
that
i
mirror
myself
in
these
depths
of
propriety
the
social
scheme
as
we
knew
it
was
in
its
careless
charity
worthy
of
the
golden
age
though
i
sufficiently
repeat
that
we
knew
it
both
at
its
easiest
and
its
safest
the
fruits
dropped
right
upon
the
board
to
which
we
flocked
together
the
least
of
us
and
the
greatest
with
differences
of
appetite
and
of
reach
doubtless
but
not
with
differences
of
place
and
of
proportionate
share
my
appetite
and
my
reach
in
respect
to
the
more
uncle
tom
might
have
brooked
certainly
any
comparison
i
must
have
partaken
thoroughly
of
the
feast
to
have
left
the
various
aftertastes
so
separate
and
so
strong
it
was
a
great
thing
to
have
a
canon
to
judge
by
it
helped
conscious
criticism
which
was
to
fit
on
wings
for
use
ever
after
to
the
shoulders
of
appreciation
in
the
light
of
that
advantage
i
could
be
my
second
eliza
was
less
dramatic
than
my
first
and
that
my
first
cassy
that
of
the
great
and
bellamy
of
the
touched
depths
which
made
the
lady
at
the
national
prosaic
and
placid
i
could
already
be
down
on
a
placid
cassy
just
as
on
the
other
hand
the
rocking
of
the
of
the
ohio
with
the
desperate
eliza
infant
in
arms
balancing
for
a
leap
from
one
to
the
other
had
here
less
of
the
audible
creak
of
carpentry
emulated
a
trifle
more
to
my
perception
the
real
water
of
crummles
pump
they
ca
even
at
that
have
emulated
it
much
and
one
almost
envies
quite
making
up
one
mind
not
to
denounce
the
simple
faith
of
an
age
beguiled
by
arts
so
rude
however
the
point
exactly
was
that
we
attended
this
spectacle
just
in
order
to
be
beguiled
just
in
order
to
enjoy
with
ironic
detachment
and
at
the
very
most
to
be
amused
ourselves
at
our
sensibility
should
it
prove
to
have
been
trapped
and
caught
to
have
become
thus
aware
of
our
collective
attitude
constituted
for
one
small
spectator
at
least
a
great
initiation
he
got
his
first
glimpse
of
that
possibility
of
a
free
play
of
mind
over
a
subject
which
was
to
throw
him
with
force
at
a
later
stage
of
culture
when
subjects
had
considerably
multiplied
into
the
critical
arms
of
matthew
arnold
so
he
is
himself
at
least
interested
in
seeing
the
matter
as
a
progress
in
which
the
first
step
was
taken
before
that
crude
scenic
appeal
by
his
wondering
among
his
companions
where
the
absurd
the
absurd
for
ended
and
the
fun
the
real
fun
which
was
the
gravity
the
tragedy
the
drollery
the
beauty
the
thing
itself
briefly
might
be
legitimately
and
tastefully
held
to
begin
uncanny
though
the
remark
perhaps
i
am
not
sure
i
was
thus
more
interested
in
the
pulse
of
our
party
under
my
tiny
recording
thumb
than
in
the
beat
of
the
drama
and
the
shock
of
its
opposed
forces
vivid
and
touching
as
the
contrast
was
then
found
for
instance
between
the
topsy
the
clad
in
a
pinafore
of
sackcloth
and
destined
to
become
for
millions
the
type
of
the
absolute
in
the
artless
and
her
little
mistress
the
blonde
eva
a
figure
rather
in
the
kenwigs
tradition
of
pantalettes
and
pigtails
whom
i
recall
as
perching
quite
suicidally
with
her
elbows
out
and
a
preliminary
shriek
on
that
bulwark
of
the
mississippi
steamboat
which
was
to
facilitate
her
all
but
fatal
immersion
in
the
flood
why
should
i
have
duly
noted
that
no
little
game
on
her
part
could
well
less
have
resembled
or
simulated
an
accident
and
yet
have
been
no
less
moved
by
her
reappearance
rescued
from
the
river
but
perfectly
dry
in
the
arms
of
faithful
tom
who
had
plunged
in
to
save
her
without
either
so
much
as
wetting
his
shoes
than
if
i
had
been
engaged
with
her
in
a
reckless
romp
i
could
count
the
white
stitches
in
the
loose
patchwork
and
yet
could
take
it
for
a
story
rich
and
harmonious
i
could
know
we
had
all
intellectually
condescended
and
that
we
had
yet
had
the
thrill
of
an
æsthetic
adventure
and
this
was
a
brave
beginning
for
a
consciousness
that
was
to
be
nothing
if
not
mixed
and
a
curiosity
that
was
to
be
nothing
if
not
restless
the
principle
of
this
prolonged
arrest
which
i
insist
on
prolonging
a
little
further
is
doubtless
in
my
instinct
to
grope
for
our
earliest
æsthetic
seeds
careless
at
once
and
generous
the
hands
by
which
they
were
sown
but
practically
appointed
none
the
less
to
cause
that
peculiarly
flurried
hare
to
run
flurried
because
over
ground
so
little
native
to
it
when
so
many
others
held
back
is
it
air
of
romance
that
gilds
for
me
then
the
barnum
background
taking
it
as
a
symbol
that
makes
me
resist
to
this
effect
of
a
passionate
adverse
loyalty
any
impulse
to
translate
into
harsh
terms
any
old
sordidities
and
poverties
the
great
american
museum
the
scenery
and
aspects
at
large
and
even
the
improvements
on
them
as
then
flourishing
why
they
must
have
been
for
the
most
part
of
the
last
meanness
the
barnum
picture
above
all
ignoble
and
awful
its
blatant
face
or
frame
stuck
about
with
innumerable
flags
that
waved
poor
ensigns
over
spurious
relics
and
catchpenny
monsters
in
effigy
to
say
nothing
of
the
promise
within
of
the
still
more
monstrous
and
abnormal
living
from
the
total
impression
of
which
things
we
plucked
somehow
the
flower
of
the
ideal
it
grew
i
must
in
justice
proceed
much
more
sweetly
and
naturally
at
niblo
which
represented
in
our
scheme
the
ideal
evening
while
barnum
figured
the
ideal
day
so
that
i
ask
myself
with
that
sense
of
our
resorting
there
under
the
rich
cover
of
night
which
was
the
supreme
charm
how
it
comes
that
this
larger
memory
has
swallowed
up
all
others
for
here
absolutely
the
flower
at
its
finest
and
grown
as
nowhere
else
grown
in
the
great
garden
of
the
ravel
family
and
offered
again
and
again
to
our
deep
inhalation
i
see
the
ravels
french
acrobats
dancers
and
pantomimists
as
representing
for
our
culture
pure
grace
and
charm
and
civility
so
that
one
doubts
whether
any
candid
community
was
ever
so
much
in
debt
to
a
race
of
entertainers
or
had
so
happy
and
prolonged
so
personal
and
grateful
a
relation
with
them
they
must
have
been
with
their
offshoots
of
martinettis
and
others
of
three
or
four
generations
besides
being
of
a
rich
theatrical
stock
generally
and
we
had
our
particular
friends
and
favourites
among
them
we
seemed
to
follow
them
through
every
phase
of
their
career
to
assist
at
their
tottering
steps
along
the
as
very
small
children
kept
in
equilibrium
by
very
big
caretakers
here
walking
under
in
case
of
falls
to
greet
them
as
madame
axel
of
robust
maturity
and
in
a
spanish
costume
bounding
on
the
same
tense
cord
more
heavily
but
more
assuredly
and
finally
to
know
the
climax
of
the
art
with
them
in
raoul
or
the
and
jocko
or
the
brazilian
ape
and
all
this
in
the
course
of
our
own
brief
infancy
my
impression
of
them
bristles
so
with
memories
that
we
seem
to
have
rallied
to
their
different
productions
with
much
the
same
regularity
with
which
we
formed
fresh
educational
connections
and
they
were
so
much
our
property
and
our
pride
that
they
supported
us
handsomely
through
all
fluttered
entertainment
of
the
occasional
albany
cousins
i
remember
how
when
one
of
these
visitors
wound
up
in
honour
of
new
york
to
the
very
fever
of
perception
broke
out
one
evening
while
we
waited
for
the
curtain
to
rise
oh
do
you
hear
the
cries
they
them
i
sure
they
are
ca
it
be
stopped
we
resented
the
charge
as
a
slur
on
our
very
honour
for
what
our
romantic
relative
had
heatedly
imagined
to
reach
us
in
a
manner
from
behind
was
the
sounds
attendant
on
the
application
of
blows
to
some
acrobatic
infant
who
had
funked
his
little
job
impossible
such
horrors
in
the
world
of
pure
poetry
opened
out
to
us
at
niblo
a
temple
of
illusion
of
tragedy
and
comedy
and
pathos
that
though
its
of
stony
brown
metropolitan
hotel
on
the
wrong
side
must
have
been
bleak
and
vulgar
flung
its
glamour
forth
into
broadway
what
more
pathetic
for
instance
so
that
we
publicly
wept
than
the
fate
of
wondrous
martinetti
jocko
who
after
befriending
a
hapless
french
family
wrecked
on
the
coast
of
brazil
and
bringing
back
to
life
a
small
boy
rescued
from
the
waves
i
see
even
now
with
every
detail
this
inanimate
victim
supine
on
the
strand
met
his
death
by
some
cruel
bullet
of
which
i
have
forgotten
the
determinant
cause
only
remembering
the
final
agony
as
something
we
could
scarce
bear
and
a
strain
of
our
sensibility
to
which
our
parents
repeatedly
questioned
the
wisdom
of
exposing
us
these
performers
and
these
things
were
in
all
probability
but
of
a
middling
skill
and
splendour
it
was
the
age
and
we
were
caught
by
mild
marvels
even
if
a
friendly
good
faith
in
them
something
sweet
and
sympathetic
was
after
all
a
value
whether
of
their
own
humanity
their
own
special
quality
or
only
of
our
innocence
never
to
be
renewed
but
i
light
this
taper
to
the
initiators
so
to
call
them
whom
i
remembered
when
we
had
left
them
behind
as
if
they
had
given
us
a
silver
key
to
carry
off
and
so
to
refit
after
long
years
to
sweet
names
never
thought
of
from
then
till
now
signor
léon
javelli
in
whom
the
french
and
the
italian
charm
appear
to
have
met
who
was
he
and
what
did
he
brilliantly
do
and
why
of
a
sudden
do
i
thus
recall
and
admire
him
i
am
afraid
he
but
danced
the
the
most
domestic
of
our
friends
resources
as
it
brought
them
out
by
the
far
stretch
of
the
rope
into
the
bosom
of
the
house
and
against
our
very
hearts
where
they
leapt
and
bounded
and
wavered
and
recovered
closely
face
to
face
with
us
but
i
dare
say
he
bounded
brave
signor
léon
to
the
greatest
height
of
all
let
this
vague
agility
in
any
case
connect
him
with
that
revelation
of
the
ballet
the
of
other
years
which
in
the
four
lovers
for
example
a
pantomimic
lesson
as
in
words
of
one
syllable
but
all
quick
and
gay
and
droll
would
have
affected
us
as
classic
i
am
sure
had
we
then
had
at
our
disposal
that
term
of
appreciation
when
we
read
in
english
about
the
pantomimes
in
london
which
somehow
cropped
up
in
them
so
often
those
were
the
only
things
that
did
make
us
yearn
so
much
we
felt
we
were
masters
of
the
type
and
so
almost
sufficiently
was
that
a
for
london
constantly
deferred
we
had
the
it
was
true
though
what
this
really
seemed
to
come
to
was
clown
and
harlequin
taking
liberties
with
policemen
these
last
evidently
a
sharp
note
in
a
picturesqueness
that
we
lacked
our
own
slouchy
officers
saying
nothing
to
us
of
that
sort
but
we
had
at
niblo
harlequin
and
columbine
albeit
of
less
pure
a
tradition
and
we
knew
moreover
all
about
clowns
for
we
went
to
circuses
too
and
so
repeatedly
that
when
i
add
them
to
our
list
of
recreations
the
good
old
orthodox
circuses
under
tents
set
up
in
vacant
lots
with
which
new
york
appears
at
that
time
to
have
bristled
time
and
place
would
seem
to
have
shrunken
for
most
other
pursuits
and
not
least
for
that
of
serious
learning
and
the
case
is
aggravated
as
i
remember
franconi
which
we
more
or
less
haunted
and
which
aiming
at
the
grander
style
and
the
monumental
effect
blazed
with
fresh
paint
and
rang
with
roman
up
there
among
the
deserts
of
street
or
wherever
considerably
south
perhaps
but
only
a
little
east
of
the
vaster
desolations
that
gave
scope
to
the
crystal
palace
second
of
its
name
since
following
not
alas
the
london
structure
of
this
enterprise
forestalled
by
a
year
or
two
the
paris
palais
de
of
such
as
it
was
i
feel
again
its
majesty
on
those
occasions
on
which
i
dragged
if
i
must
here
once
more
speak
for
myself
only
after
albany
cousins
through
its
courts
of
edification
i
remember
being
very
tired
and
cold
and
hungry
there
in
a
little
light
drab
and
very
glossy
or
shiny
talma
breasted
with
rather
troublesome
though
concomitantly
conscious
that
i
was
somehow
in
europe
since
everything
about
me
had
been
brought
over
which
ought
to
have
been
consoling
and
seems
in
fact
to
have
been
so
in
some
degree
inasmuch
as
both
my
own
pain
and
the
sense
of
the
cousinly
the
albany
headaches
quite
fade
in
that
recovered
presence
of
big
european
art
embodied
in
thorwaldsen
enormous
christ
and
the
disciples
a
shining
marble
company
ranged
in
a
semicircle
of
dark
maroon
walls
if
this
was
europe
then
europe
was
beautiful
indeed
and
we
rose
to
it
on
the
wings
of
wonder
never
were
we
afterwards
to
see
great
showy
sculpture
in
whatever
profuse
exhibition
or
of
whatever
period
or
school
without
some
renewal
of
that
charmed
thorwaldsen
hour
some
taste
again
of
the
almost
sugary
or
confectionery
sweetness
with
which
the
great
white
images
had
affected
us
under
their
gaslight
the
crystal
palace
was
vast
and
various
and
dense
which
was
what
europe
was
going
to
be
it
was
a
jungle
of
impressions
that
were
somehow
challenges
even
as
we
might
helplessly
defied
find
foreign
words
and
practices
over
which
formidably
towered
mounted
amazon
attacked
by
a
leopard
or
whatever
a
work
judged
at
that
day
sublime
and
the
glory
of
the
place
so
that
i
felt
the
journey
back
in
the
autumn
dusk
and
the
sixth
avenue
cars
established
just
in
time
a
relapse
into
soothing
flatness
a
return
to
the
fourteenth
street
horizon
from
a
far
journey
and
a
hundred
looming
questions
that
would
still
tremendous
thought
come
up
for
all
the
personal
answers
of
which
one
cultivated
the
seed
xiii
let
me
hurry
however
to
catch
again
that
thread
i
left
dangling
from
my
glance
at
our
small
vague
spasms
of
school
my
personal
sense
of
them
being
as
vague
and
small
i
mean
in
contrast
with
the
fuller
and
stronger
cup
meted
out
all
round
to
the
albany
cousins
much
more
privileged
i
felt
in
every
stroke
of
fortune
or
at
least
much
more
interesting
though
it
might
be
wicked
to
call
them
more
happy
through
those
numberless
bereavements
that
had
so
enriched
their
existence
i
mentioned
above
in
particular
the
enviable
consciousness
of
our
little
kinsman
gus
barker
who
as
by
a
sharp
prevision
snatched
what
gaiety
he
might
from
a
life
to
be
cut
short
in
a
cavalry
dash
by
one
of
the
confederate
bullets
of
he
blew
out
at
us
on
new
york
sundays
as
i
have
said
sharp
puffs
of
the
atmosphere
of
the
institution
charlier
strong
to
us
that
is
the
atmosphere
of
whose
institutions
was
weak
but
it
was
above
all
during
a
gregarious
visit
paid
him
in
a
livelier
field
still
that
i
knew
myself
merely
and
brother
it
had
been
his
fate
to
be
but
scantly
the
latter
and
never
at
all
the
former
our
aunt
janet
had
not
survived
his
birth
but
on
this
day
of
our
collective
pilgrimage
to
where
he
was
at
a
military
school
and
clad
in
a
fashion
that
represented
to
me
the
very
panoply
of
war
he
shone
with
a
rare
radiance
of
privation
ingenuous
and
responsive
of
a
social
disposition
a
candour
of
gaiety
that
matched
his
physical
activity
the
most
beautifully
made
athletic
little
person
and
in
the
highest
degree
appealing
and
engaging
he
not
only
did
us
the
honours
of
his
dazzling
academy
dazzling
at
least
to
me
but
had
all
the
air
of
showing
us
over
the
great
state
prison
which
even
then
flourished
near
at
hand
and
to
which
he
accompanied
us
a
party
of
a
composition
that
comes
back
to
me
as
wonderful
the
new
york
and
albany
cousinships
appearing
to
have
converged
and
met
for
the
happy
occasion
with
the
generations
and
sexes
melting
together
and
moving
in
a
loose
harmonious
band
the
party
must
have
been
less
numerous
than
by
the
romantic
tradition
or
confused
notation
of
my
youth
and
what
i
mainly
remember
of
it
beyond
my
sense
of
our
being
at
once
an
attendant
train
to
my
aged
and
gentle
and
in
general
most
unadventurous
grandmother
and
a
chorus
of
curiosity
and
amusement
roundabout
the
vivid
gussy
is
our
collective
impression
that
state
prisons
were
on
the
whole
delightful
places
vast
bright
and
breezy
with
a
gay
free
circulation
in
corridors
and
on
stairs
a
pleasant
prevalence
of
hot
soup
and
fresh
crusty
rolls
in
tins
of
which
visitors
admiringly
partook
and
for
the
latter
in
chance
corners
and
on
sunny
landings
much
interesting
light
brush
of
gentlemen
remarkable
but
for
gentlemanly
crimes
that
is
defalcations
and
malversations
to
striking
and
impressive
amounts
i
recall
our
coming
on
such
a
figure
at
the
foot
of
a
staircase
and
his
having
been
announced
to
us
by
our
conductor
or
friend
in
charge
as
likely
to
be
there
and
what
a
charm
i
found
in
his
cool
loose
uniform
of
shining
white
as
i
was
afterwards
to
figure
it
as
well
as
in
his
generally
refined
and
distinguished
appearance
and
in
the
fact
that
he
was
engaged
while
exposed
to
our
attention
in
the
commendable
act
of
paring
his
nails
with
a
smart
penknife
and
that
he
did
allow
us
to
interrupt
him
one
of
my
companions
i
forget
which
had
advised
me
that
in
these
contacts
with
illustrious
misfortune
i
was
to
be
careful
not
to
stare
and
present
to
me
at
this
moment
is
the
wonder
of
whether
he
would
think
it
staring
to
note
that
quite
stared
and
also
that
his
hands
were
fine
and
fair
and
one
of
them
adorned
with
a
signet
ring
i
was
to
have
later
in
life
a
glimpse
of
two
or
three
dismal
penitentiaries
places
affecting
me
as
sordid
as
dark
and
dreadful
but
if
the
revelation
of
had
involved
the
idea
of
a
timely
warning
to
the
young
mind
my
small
sensibility
at
least
was
not
reached
by
the
lesson
i
envied
the
celebrity
in
the
array
of
a
planter
at
his
ease
we
might
have
been
slaves
quite
as
much
as
i
envied
gussy
in
connection
with
which
i
may
remark
here
that
though
in
that
early
time
i
seem
to
have
been
constantly
eager
to
exchange
my
lot
for
that
of
somebody
else
on
the
assumed
certainty
of
gaining
by
the
bargain
i
fail
to
remember
feeling
jealous
of
such
happier
persons
in
the
measure
open
to
children
of
spirit
i
had
rather
a
positive
lack
of
the
passion
and
thereby
i
suppose
a
lack
of
spirit
since
if
jealousy
bears
as
i
think
on
what
one
sees
one
companions
able
to
do
as
against
one
own
falling
short
envy
as
i
knew
it
at
least
was
simply
of
what
they
or
in
other
words
of
a
certain
sort
of
richer
consciousness
supposed
doubtless
often
too
freely
supposed
in
them
they
were
so
that
was
what
i
felt
and
to
other
other
almost
anyhow
seemed
as
good
as
the
probable
taste
of
the
bright
compound
wistfully
watched
in
the
confectioner
window
unattainable
impossible
of
course
but
as
to
which
just
this
impossibility
and
just
that
privation
kept
those
active
proceedings
in
which
jealousy
seeks
relief
quite
out
of
the
question
a
platitude
of
acceptance
of
the
poor
actual
the
absence
of
all
vision
of
how
in
any
degree
to
change
it
combined
with
a
complacency
an
acuity
of
perception
of
alternatives
though
a
view
of
them
as
only
through
the
confectioner
hard
glass
that
is
what
i
recover
as
the
nearest
approach
to
an
apology
in
the
soil
of
my
nature
for
the
springing
seed
of
emulation
i
never
dreamed
of
competing
a
business
having
in
it
at
the
best
for
my
temper
if
not
for
my
total
failure
of
temper
a
displeasing
ferocity
if
competing
was
bad
snatching
was
therefore
still
worse
and
jealousy
was
a
sort
of
spiritual
snatching
with
which
nevertheless
all
the
while
one
might
have
been
like
who
had
such
horizons
a
helpless
little
love
of
horizons
i
certainly
cherished
and
could
sometimes
even
care
for
my
own
these
always
shrank
however
under
almost
any
suggestion
of
a
further
range
or
finer
shade
in
the
purple
rim
offered
to
other
eyes
and
that
is
what
i
take
for
the
restlessness
of
envy
it
was
that
i
wished
to
change
with
everyone
with
anyone
at
a
venture
but
that
i
saw
gifts
everywhere
but
as
mine
and
that
i
scarce
know
whether
to
call
the
effect
of
this
miserable
or
monstrous
it
was
the
effect
at
least
of
i
mean
to
visions
there
must
have
been
on
that
occasion
of
the
day
which
it
deeply
interests
me
to
piece
together
some
state
of
connection
for
some
of
us
with
the
hospitalities
of
rhinebeck
the
place
of
abode
of
the
eldest
of
the
albany
uncles
that
is
of
the
three
most
in
our
view
for
there
were
two
others
the
eldest
of
all
a
only
who
formed
a
class
quite
by
himself
and
the
very
youngest
who
with
lively
interests
of
his
own
had
still
less
attention
for
us
than
either
of
his
three
brothers
the
house
at
rhinebeck
and
all
its
accessories
which
struck
our
young
sense
as
innumerable
in
especial
the
great
bluff
of
the
hudson
on
which
it
stood
yields
me
images
scarcely
dimmed
though
as
the
effect
but
of
snatches
of
acquaintance
there
at
all
events
the
ever
so
gently
and
dryly
albany
grandmother
with
the
albany
cousins
as
to
whom
i
here
discriminate
her
two
adopted
daughters
maturest
and
mildest
of
the
general
tribe
must
have
paused
for
a
stay
a
feature
of
which
would
be
perhaps
her
juncture
with
the
new
york
contingent
somewhere
sociably
achieved
for
the
befriending
of
juvenile
gussy
it
shimmers
there
the
whole
circumstance
with
i
scarce
know
what
large
innocence
of
charity
and
ease
the
for
reunion
all
so
thin
yet
so
important
an
appeal
the
simplicity
of
the
interests
and
the
doings
the
assumptions
and
the
concessions
each
so
touching
almost
so
edifying
we
were
surely
all
gentle
and
generous
together
floating
in
such
a
clean
light
social
order
sweetly
proof
against
ennui
unless
it
be
a
bad
note
as
is
conceivable
never
to
feel
bored
and
thankful
for
the
smallest
æsthetic
or
romantic
mercies
my
vision
loses
itself
withal
in
vaster
connections
above
all
in
my
general
sense
of
the
then
grand
newness
of
the
hudson
river
railroad
so
far
at
least
as
its
completion
to
albany
was
concerned
a
modern
blessing
that
even
the
youngest
of
us
were
in
a
position
to
appraise
the
time
had
been
when
the
steamboat
had
to
content
us
and
i
feel
how
amply
it
must
have
done
so
as
i
recall
the
thrill
of
docking
in
dim
early
dawns
the
whole
hour
of
the
albany
waterside
the
night
of
huge
strange
paddling
and
pattering
and
shrieking
and
creaking
once
ended
and
contrast
with
it
all
certain
long
sessions
in
the
train
at
an
age
and
in
conditions
when
neither
train
nor
traveller
had
suffered
chastening
sessions
of
a
high
animation
as
i
recast
them
but
at
the
same
time
of
mortal
intensities
of
lassitude
the
elements
here
indeed
are
much
confused
and
mixed
i
must
have
known
that
discipline
of
the
hectic
interest
and
the
extravagant
strain
in
relation
to
rhinebeck
only
an
doubtless
on
the
way
to
new
york
for
the
albany
kinship
but
the
limit
to
our
smaller
patiences
of
any
northward
and
yet
not
the
young
fatigue
i
repeat
but
the
state
of
easy
wonder
is
what
most
comes
back
the
stops
too
repeated
but
perversely
engaging
the
heat
and
the
glare
too
great
but
the
river
by
the
window
making
reaches
and
glimpses
so
that
the
great
swing
of
picture
and
force
of
light
and
colour
were
themselves
a
constant
adventure
the
uncles
above
all
too
too
recurrent
to
the
creation
of
a
positive
soreness
of
sympathy
of
curiosity
and
yet
constituting
by
their
presence
half
the
enlargement
of
the
time
for
the
presence
of
uncles
incoherent
albany
uncles
is
somehow
what
most
gives
these
hours
their
stamp
for
memory
i
scarce
know
why
nor
do
i
much
i
confess
distinguish
occasions
but
i
see
what
i
see
the
long
the
rattling
car
of
the
old
open
native
form
and
the
old
harsh
native
exposure
the
sense
of
arrival
forever
postponed
qualified
however
also
by
that
of
having
in
my
hands
a
volume
of
arsène
houssaye
philosophes
et
comédiennes
remarkably
submitted
by
one
of
my
relatives
to
my
judgment
i
see
them
always
the
relatives
in
slow
circulation
restless
and
nervous
and
casual
their
note
not
less
than
strikingly
genial
but
with
vaguenesses
lapses
eclipses
that
deprived
their
society
of
a
tactless
weight
they
cheered
us
on
in
their
way
born
optimists
clearly
if
not
logically
determined
ones
they
were
always
reassuring
and
sustaining
though
with
a
bright
brevity
that
must
have
taken
immensities
i
think
for
granted
they
wore
their
hats
slightly
toward
the
nose
they
strolled
they
hung
about
they
reported
of
progress
and
of
the
company
they
dropped
suggestions
new
magazines
packets
of
the
edible
deprecated
for
the
immature
they
figured
in
fine
to
a
small
nephew
as
the
principal
men
of
their
time
and
so
far
as
the
two
younger
and
more
familiar
were
concerned
the
most
splendid
as
to
aspect
and
apparel
it
was
none
the
less
to
the
least
shining
though
not
essentially
the
least
comforting
of
this
social
trio
that
if
i
rightly
remember
i
owed
my
introduction
to
the
of
the
eighteenth
century
there
tags
itself
at
any
rate
to
the
impression
a
flutter
as
of
some
faint
some
recaptured
grimace
for
another
of
his
kindly
offices
which
i
associate
somehow
with
the
deck
of
a
steamboat
his
production
for
our
vague
benefit
of
a
literary
classic
the
confessions
as
he
called
our
attention
to
them
of
the
celebrated
rosseau
i
catch
again
the
echo
of
the
mirth
excited
to
my
surprise
by
this
communication
and
recover
as
well
my
responsive
advance
toward
a
work
that
seemed
so
to
promise
but
especially
have
i
it
before
me
that
some
play
of
light
criticism
mostly
attended
on
the
part
of
any
circle
this
more
ambitious
remarks
for
all
that
and
in
spite
of
oddities
of
appearance
and
type
it
was
augustus
james
who
spread
widest
in
default
of
towering
highest
to
my
wistful
view
of
the
larger
life
and
who
covered
definite
and
accessible
ground
this
ground
the
house
and
precincts
of
linwood
at
rhinebeck
harboured
our
tender
years
i
surmise
but
at
few
and
brief
moments
but
it
had
taken
many
of
these
to
make
it
the
image
of
an
hospitality
liberal
as
i
supposed
great
social
situations
were
liberal
suppositions
on
this
score
having
in
childhood
or
at
least
they
had
in
mine
as
little
as
possible
to
do
with
dry
data
did
linwood
bristle
with
great
views
and
other
glories
with
gardens
and
graperies
and
black
ponies
to
say
nothing
of
gardeners
and
grooms
who
were
notoriously
and
quotedly
droll
to
say
nothing
in
particular
of
our
aunt
elizabeth
who
had
been
miss
bay
of
albany
who
was
the
mother
of
the
fair
and
free
young
in
new
york
and
who
floats
back
to
me
through
the
rhinebeck
picture
aquiline
but
easy
with
an
effect
of
handsome
highbrowed
looseness
of
or
streaming
shawls
the
dowdy
the
delightful
shawl
of
the
period
and
of
claws
of
bright
benevolent
steel
that
kept
nipping
for
our
charmed
advantage
roses
and
grapes
and
peaches
and
together
with
turns
of
phrase
and
scraps
of
remark
that
fell
as
by
quite
a
like
flash
of
shears
these
are
mere
scrapings
of
but
my
mind
owes
her
a
vibration
that
however
tiny
was
to
insist
all
these
years
on
on
figuring
in
a
whole
complex
of
picture
and
drama
the
clearest
note
of
which
was
that
of
worry
and
woe
a
crisis
prolonged
in
outer
galleries
through
hot
august
evenings
and
amid
the
dim
flare
of
open
windows
to
the
hum
of
domesticated
insects
all
but
inexpressible
the
part
played
in
the
young
mind
naturally
even
though
perversely
even
though
inordinately
arranged
as
a
stage
for
the
procession
and
exhibition
of
appearances
by
matters
all
of
a
usual
cast
contacts
and
impressions
not
arriving
at
the
dignity
of
shocks
but
happening
to
be
to
the
taste
as
one
may
say
of
the
little
intelligence
happening
to
be
such
as
the
fond
fancy
could
assimilate
one
record
becomes
under
memories
of
this
order
and
that
is
the
only
trouble
a
tale
of
assimilations
small
and
fine
out
of
which
refuse
directly
interesting
to
the
only
the
most
branching
vegetations
may
be
conceived
as
having
sprung
such
are
the
absurdities
of
the
poor
dear
inward
life
when
translated
that
is
and
perhaps
ineffectually
translated
into
terms
of
the
outward
and
trying
at
all
to
flourish
on
the
lines
of
the
outward
a
reflection
that
might
stay
me
here
were
it
that
i
somehow
feel
morally
affiliated
tied
as
by
knotted
fibres
to
the
elements
involved
one
of
these
was
assuredly
that
my
father
had
again
characteristically
suffered
me
to
dangle
he
having
been
called
to
linwood
by
the
dire
trouble
of
his
sister
temple
and
brought
me
with
him
from
staten
island
i
make
the
matter
out
as
of
the
summer
of
we
had
come
up
he
and
i
to
new
york
but
our
doings
there
with
the
journey
following
are
a
blank
to
me
i
recover
but
my
sense
on
our
arrival
of
being
for
the
first
time
in
the
presence
of
tragedy
which
the
shining
scene
roundabout
made
more
sinister
sharpened
even
to
the
point
of
my
feeling
abashed
and
irrelevant
wondering
why
i
had
come
my
aunt
under
her
brother
roof
had
left
her
husband
wasted
with
consumption
near
death
at
albany
gravely
ill
herself
she
had
taken
the
disease
from
him
as
it
was
taken
in
those
days
and
was
in
the
event
very
scantly
to
survive
him
she
had
been
ordered
away
in
her
own
interest
for
which
she
cared
no
scrap
and
my
father
the
person
in
all
his
family
most
justly
appealed
and
most
anxiously
listened
to
had
been
urged
to
come
and
support
her
in
a
separation
that
she
passionately
rejected
vivid
to
me
still
as
floating
across
verandahs
into
the
hot
afternoon
stillness
is
the
wail
of
her
protest
and
her
grief
i
remember
being
scared
and
hushed
by
it
and
stealing
away
beyond
its
reach
i
remember
not
less
what
resources
of
high
control
the
whole
case
imputed
for
my
imagination
to
my
father
and
how
creeping
off
to
the
edge
of
the
eminence
above
the
hudson
i
somehow
felt
the
great
bright
harmonies
of
air
and
space
becoming
one
with
my
rather
proud
assurance
and
confidence
that
of
my
own
connection
for
life
for
interest
with
such
sources
of
light
the
great
impression
however
the
one
that
has
brought
me
so
far
was
another
matter
only
that
of
the
close
outer
evening
aforesaid
with
my
parent
again
somewhere
deep
within
yet
not
too
far
to
make
us
hold
our
breath
for
it
tenderly
opposing
his
sister
purpose
of
flight
and
the
presence
at
my
side
of
my
young
cousin
marie
youngest
daughter
of
the
house
exactly
of
my
own
age
and
named
in
honour
of
her
having
been
born
in
paris
to
the
influence
of
which
fact
her
shining
black
eyes
her
small
quickness
and
brownness
marking
sharply
her
difference
from
her
sisters
so
oddly
so
almost
extravagantly
testified
it
had
come
home
to
me
by
some
voice
of
the
air
that
she
was
spoiled
and
it
made
her
in
the
highest
degree
interesting
we
ourselves
had
been
so
associated
at
home
without
being
in
the
least
spoiled
i
think
we
even
rather
missed
it
so
that
i
knew
about
these
subjects
of
invidious
reflection
only
by
literature
mainly
no
doubt
that
of
the
nursery
in
which
they
formed
quite
by
themselves
a
romantic
class
and
the
fond
fancy
always
predominant
i
prized
even
while
a
little
dreading
the
chance
to
see
the
condition
at
work
this
chance
was
given
me
it
was
clear
though
i
risk
in
my
record
of
it
a
final
anticlimax
by
a
remark
from
my
uncle
augustus
to
his
daughter
seated
duskily
in
our
group
which
included
two
or
three
dim
dependent
forms
he
expressed
the
strong
opinion
that
marie
should
go
to
bed
expressed
it
that
is
with
the
casual
cursory
humour
that
was
to
strike
me
as
the
main
expressional
resource
of
outstanding
members
of
the
family
and
that
would
perhaps
have
had
under
analysis
the
defect
of
making
judgment
very
personal
without
quite
making
authority
so
authority
they
had
of
a
truth
these
all
so
human
outstanding
ones
they
made
shift
but
with
light
appreciation
sudden
suggestion
a
peculiar
variety
of
happy
remark
in
the
air
it
had
been
remarked
but
in
the
air
i
feel
sure
that
marie
should
seek
her
couch
a
truth
by
the
dark
wing
of
which
i
ruefully
felt
myself
brushed
and
the
words
seemed
therefore
to
fall
with
a
certain
ironic
weight
what
i
have
retained
of
their
effect
at
any
rate
is
the
vague
fact
of
some
objection
raised
by
my
cousin
and
some
sharper
point
to
his
sentence
supplied
by
her
father
promptly
merged
in
a
visible
commotion
a
flutter
of
my
young
companion
across
the
gallery
as
for
refuge
in
the
maternal
arms
a
protest
and
an
appeal
in
short
which
drew
from
my
aunt
the
simple
phrase
that
was
from
that
moment
so
preposterously
to
count
for
me
come
now
my
dear
do
make
a
scene
i
on
your
not
making
a
scene
that
was
all
the
witchcraft
the
occasion
used
but
the
note
was
none
the
less
the
expression
so
vivid
so
portentous
was
one
i
had
never
heard
it
had
never
been
addressed
to
us
at
home
and
who
should
say
now
what
a
world
one
might
at
once
read
into
it
it
seemed
freighted
to
sail
so
far
it
told
me
so
much
about
life
life
at
these
intensities
clearly
became
scenes
but
the
great
thing
the
immense
illumination
was
that
we
could
make
them
or
not
as
we
chose
it
was
a
long
time
of
course
before
i
began
to
distinguish
between
those
within
our
compass
more
particularly
as
spoiled
and
those
producible
on
a
different
basis
and
which
should
involve
detachment
involve
presence
of
mind
just
the
qualities
in
which
marie
possible
output
was
apparently
deficient
it
did
in
the
least
matter
accordingly
whether
or
no
a
scene
then
proceeded
to
and
i
have
lost
all
count
of
what
immediately
happened
the
mark
had
been
made
for
me
and
the
door
flung
open
the
passage
gathering
up
the
elements
of
the
troubled
time
had
been
itself
a
scene
quite
enough
of
one
and
i
had
become
aware
with
it
of
a
rich
accession
of
possibilities
xiv
it
must
have
been
after
the
episode
that
gussy
came
to
us
in
new
york
for
sundays
and
holidays
from
scarce
further
off
than
round
the
corner
his
foreign
institution
flourishing
i
seem
to
remember
in
west
tenth
street
or
wherever
and
yet
as
floated
by
exotic
airs
and
with
the
scent
of
the
hanging
about
him
he
was
being
educated
largely
with
cubans
and
mexicans
in
those
new
york
days
more
than
half
the
little
flock
of
the
foreign
institutions
in
general
over
whom
his
easy
triumphs
while
he
wagged
his
little
red
head
for
them
were
abundantly
credible
reinforced
as
my
special
sense
of
them
was
moreover
by
the
similar
situation
of
his
sister
older
than
he
but
also
steeped
in
the
exotic
medium
and
also
sometimes
bringing
us
queer
echoes
of
the
tongues
i
remember
being
deputed
by
my
mother
to
go
and
converse
with
her
on
some
question
of
her
coming
to
us
at
the
establishment
of
madame
reichhardt
pronounced
à
la
française
réchard
where
i
felt
that
i
had
crossed
for
the
hour
the
very
threshold
of
europe
it
being
impressed
on
me
by
my
cousin
who
was
tall
and
handsome
and
happy
with
a
laugh
of
more
beautiful
sound
than
any
laugh
we
were
to
know
again
that
french
only
was
speakable
on
the
premises
i
sniffed
it
up
aromatically
the
superior
language
in
passage
and
parlour
it
took
the
form
of
some
strong
savoury
soup
an
educational
that
must
excellently
have
formed
the
taste
that
was
again
i
felt
as
i
came
away
a
part
of
the
rich
experience
of
being
thrown
in
tender
juvenile
form
upon
the
world
this
genial
girl
like
her
brother
was
in
the
grand
situation
of
having
no
home
and
of
carrying
on
life
such
a
splendid
kind
of
life
by
successive
visits
to
relations
though
neither
she
nor
gussy
quite
achieved
the
range
of
their
elder
brother
bob
of
that
ilk
a
handsome
young
man
a
just
blurred
attractive
illusive
presence
who
hovered
a
bit
beyond
our
real
reach
and
apparently
displayed
the
undomesticated
character
at
its
highest
seemed
exposed
for
his
pleasure
if
pleasure
it
was
and
my
wonder
to
every
assault
of
experience
his
very
name
took
on
from
these
imputations
a
browner
glow
and
it
was
all
in
the
right
key
that
a
few
years
later
he
should
after
showing
some
talent
for
sculpture
have
gone
the
hapless
way
of
most
of
the
albany
youth
have
become
a
theme
for
sad
vague
headshakes
kind
and
very
pitying
in
his
case
and
died
prematurely
and
pointlessly
or
in
other
words
by
my
conception
picturesquely
the
headshakes
were
heavier
and
the
sighs
sharper
for
another
slim
shade
one
of
the
younger
and
i
believe
quite
the
most
hapless
of
those
i
have
called
the
outstanding
ones
he
too
several
years
older
than
we
again
a
tormenting
hoverer
and
vanisher
he
too
charmingly
sister
though
sister
only
and
succumbing
to
monstrous
early
trouble
after
having
shown
some
talent
for
music
the
ghostliness
of
these
æsthetic
manifestations
as
i
allude
to
them
is
the
thinnest
conceivable
chip
of
stray
marble
the
faintest
twang
of
old
chords
i
ask
myself
for
the
odd
obscurity
of
it
under
what
inspiration
music
and
sculpture
may
have
tinkled
and
glimmered
to
the
albany
ear
and
eye
as
we
at
least
knew
those
organs
and
with
what
queer
and
weak
delusions
our
unfortunates
may
have
played
quite
ineffably
quaint
and
this
proposition
of
sort
of
resource
for
the
battle
of
life
as
it
then
and
there
opened
and
above
all
beautifully
suggestive
of
our
sudden
collective
disconnectedness
ours
as
the
whole
kinship
from
american
resource
of
those
days
albanian
or
other
that
precious
light
was
the
light
of
business
only
and
we
by
a
common
instinct
artlessly
joining
hands
went
forth
into
the
wilderness
without
so
much
as
a
twinkling
taper
our
consensus
on
all
this
ground
was
amazing
it
brooked
no
exception
the
word
had
been
passed
all
round
that
we
did
that
we
and
should
understand
these
things
questions
of
arithmetic
and
of
fond
calculation
questions
of
the
and
the
market
and
we
appear
to
have
held
to
our
agreement
as
loyally
and
to
have
accepted
our
doom
as
serenely
as
if
our
faith
had
been
mutually
pledged
the
rupture
with
my
grandfather
tradition
and
attitude
was
complete
we
were
never
in
a
single
case
i
think
for
two
generations
guilty
of
a
stroke
of
business
the
most
that
could
be
said
of
us
was
that
though
about
equally
wanting
all
round
in
any
faculty
of
acquisition
we
happened
to
pay
for
the
amiable
weakness
less
in
some
connections
than
in
others
the
point
was
that
we
moved
so
oddly
and
consistently
as
it
was
our
only
form
of
consistency
over
our
limited
pasture
never
straying
to
nibble
in
the
strange
or
the
steep
places
what
was
the
matter
with
us
under
this
spell
and
what
the
moral
might
have
been
for
our
case
are
issues
of
small
moment
after
all
in
face
of
the
fact
of
our
mainly
so
brief
duration
it
was
given
to
but
few
of
us
to
be
taught
by
the
event
to
be
made
to
wonder
with
the
last
intensity
what
been
the
matter
this
it
would
be
interesting
to
worry
out
might
i
take
the
time
for
the
story
would
be
told
i
conceive
by
any
mere
rueful
glance
at
other
avidities
the
preference
for
ease
the
play
of
the
passions
the
appetite
for
pleasure
these
things
have
often
accompanied
the
business
imagination
just
as
the
love
of
life
and
the
love
of
other
persons
and
of
many
of
the
things
of
the
world
just
as
quickness
of
soul
and
sense
have
again
and
again
not
excluded
it
however
it
comes
back
as
i
have
already
hinted
to
the
manner
in
which
the
things
of
the
world
could
but
present
themselves
there
were
not
enough
of
these
and
they
were
not
fine
and
fair
enough
to
engage
happily
so
much
unapplied
so
much
loose
and
crude
attention
we
had
doubtless
at
all
a
complete
play
of
intelligence
if
i
may
not
so
far
discriminate
as
to
say
had
or
our
lack
of
the
instinct
of
the
market
need
have
been
so
much
worth
speaking
of
other
curiosities
other
sympathies
might
have
redressed
the
balance
i
make
out
our
young
cousin
as
dimly
aware
of
this
while
composing
the
light
melodies
that
preluded
to
his
extinction
and
which
that
catastrophe
so
tried
to
admonish
us
to
think
of
as
promising
but
his
image
is
more
present
to
me
still
as
the
great
incitement
during
the
few
previous
years
to
our
constant
dream
of
educational
relief
of
some
finer
kind
of
social
issue
through
europe
it
was
to
europe
had
been
committed
he
was
over
there
forging
the
small
apologetic
arms
that
were
so
little
to
avail
him
but
it
was
quite
enough
for
us
that
he
pointed
the
way
to
the
pension
sillig
at
vevey
which
shone
at
us
from
afar
as
our
own
more
particular
solution
it
was
true
that
the
pension
sillig
figured
mainly
as
the
solution
in
cases
of
recognised
wildness
there
long
flourished
among
new
york
parents
whose
view
of
such
resources
had
the
proper
range
a
faith
in
it
for
that
complaint
and
it
was
as
an
act
of
faith
that
failing
other
remedies
our
young
wifeless
uncle
conscious
himself
of
no
gift
for
control
or
for
edification
had
placed
there
his
difficult
son
he
returned
with
delight
from
this
judicious
course
and
there
was
an
hour
when
we
invoked
to
intensity
a
similar
one
in
our
own
interest
and
when
the
air
of
home
did
little
but
reflect
from
afar
the
glitter
of
blue
swiss
lakes
the
tinkle
of
in
alpine
pastures
the
rich
that
sillig
dispensing
an
education
all
of
milk
and
honey
and
edelweiss
and
combined
with
his
celebrated
firmness
for
tough
subjects
poor
came
back
i
fear
much
the
same
subject
that
he
went
but
he
had
verily
performed
his
scant
office
on
earth
that
of
having
brought
our
then
prospect
our
apparent
possibility
a
trifle
nearer
he
seemed
to
have
been
wild
even
beyond
measure
which
was
highly
disappointing
but
if
we
might
on
the
other
hand
be
open
to
the
reproach
of
falling
too
short
of
it
there
were
establishments
adapted
to
every
phase
of
the
american
predicament
so
that
our
general
direction
could
but
gain
in
vividness
i
think
with
compassion
altogether
of
the
comparative
obscurity
to
which
our
eventual
success
in
gathering
the
fruits
few
and
scant
though
they
might
be
thus
relegates
those
to
whom
it
was
given
but
to
toy
so
briefly
with
the
flowers
they
make
collectively
their
tragic
trio
the
elder
most
loved
most
beautiful
most
sacrificed
of
the
albany
uncles
the
younger
they
were
young
together
they
were
luckless
together
and
the
combination
was
as
strange
as
the
disaster
was
sweeping
and
the
daughter
and
sister
amplest
of
the
natural
easiest
of
the
idle
who
lived
on
to
dress
their
memory
with
every
thread
and
patch
of
her
own
perfect
temper
and
then
confirm
the
tradition
after
all
by
too
early
and
woeful
an
end
if
it
comes
over
me
under
the
brush
of
multiplied
memories
that
we
might
well
have
invoked
the
educational
relief
i
just
spoke
of
i
should
doubtless
as
promptly
add
that
my
own
case
must
have
been
intrinsically
of
the
poorest
and
indeed
make
the
point
once
for
all
that
i
should
be
taken
as
having
seen
and
felt
much
of
the
whole
queerness
through
the
medium
of
rare
inaptitudes
i
can
only
have
been
inapt
i
make
out
to
have
retained
so
positively
joyless
a
sense
of
it
all
to
be
aware
of
most
of
it
now
but
as
dim
confusion
as
bewildered
anxiety
there
was
interest
always
certainly
but
it
strikes
me
as
interest
in
everything
that
was
supposedly
or
prescriptively
of
the
question
at
all
and
in
nothing
that
so
respectably
involved
and
accredited
without
some
sharpness
of
interest
i
should
now
have
the
memories
but
these
stick
to
me
somehow
with
none
of
the
hard
glue
of
recovered
spirits
recovered
vivacities
assurances
successes
i
ca
have
had
through
it
all
i
think
a
throb
of
assurance
or
success
without
which
at
the
same
time
absurdly
and
indescribably
i
lived
and
wriggled
floundered
and
failed
lost
the
clue
of
everything
but
a
general
lucid
consciousness
lucid
that
is
for
my
tender
years
which
i
clutched
with
a
sense
of
its
value
what
happened
all
the
while
i
conceive
was
that
i
imagined
things
and
as
if
quite
on
system
wholly
other
than
as
they
were
and
so
carried
on
in
the
midst
of
the
actual
ones
an
existence
that
somehow
floated
and
saved
me
even
while
cutting
me
off
from
any
degree
of
direct
performance
in
fact
from
any
degree
of
direct
participation
at
all
presumably
was
the
interest
in
the
intensity
and
plausibility
and
variety
of
the
irrelevance
an
irrelevance
which
for
instance
made
all
pastors
and
masters
and
especially
all
of
benches
and
desks
all
elbowing
and
kicking
presences
within
touch
or
view
so
many
monsters
and
horrors
so
many
wonders
and
splendours
and
mysteries
but
never
so
far
as
i
can
recollect
realities
of
relation
dispensers
either
of
knowledge
or
of
fate
playmates
intimates
mere
coævals
and
coequals
they
were
something
better
better
above
all
than
the
coequal
or
coæval
they
were
so
thoroughly
figures
and
characters
divinities
or
demons
and
endowed
in
this
light
with
a
vividness
that
the
mere
reality
of
relation
a
commoner
directness
of
contact
would
have
made
i
surmise
comparatively
poor
this
superior
shade
of
interest
was
not
none
the
less
so
beguiling
that
i
recall
without
unmitigated
horror
or
something
very
like
it
a
winter
passed
with
my
brother
at
the
institution
vergnès
our
sorry
subjection
to
which
argues
to
my
present
sense
an
unmitigated
surrounding
aridity
to
a
french
school
must
have
been
earnestly
imputed
the
virtue
of
keeping
us
in
patience
till
easier
days
should
come
infinitely
touching
our
parents
view
of
that
new
york
fetish
of
our
young
time
an
acquisition
of
the
languages
an
acquisition
reinforcing
those
opportunities
which
we
enjoyed
at
home
so
far
as
they
mustered
and
at
which
i
have
briefly
glanced
charming
and
amusing
to
me
indeed
certain
faint
echoes
wavering
images
of
this
superstition
as
it
played
about
our
path
ladies
and
gentlemen
dimly
foreign
mere
broken
syllables
of
whose
names
come
back
to
me
attending
there
to
converse
in
tongues
and
then
giving
way
to
others
through
failures
of
persistence
whether
in
pupils
or
preceptors
i
know
not
there
hovers
even
count
adam
gurowski
polish
patriotic
exiled
temporarily
famous
with
the
vision
of
being
invoked
for
facility
and
then
relinquished
for
difficulty
though
i
scarce
guess
on
which
of
his
he
was
so
polyglot
that
he
even
had
a
rich
command
of
new
yorkese
xv
it
is
to
the
institution
vergnès
that
my
earliest
recovery
of
the
sense
of
being
in
any
degree
educated
with
attaches
itself
an
establishment
which
occupied
during
the
early
a
site
in
the
very
middle
of
broadway
of
the
lower
the
real
broadway
where
it
could
throb
with
the
very
pulse
of
the
traffic
in
which
we
all
innocently
rejoiced
believing
it
i
surmise
the
liveliest
conceivable
a
fact
that
is
by
itself
in
the
light
of
the
present
an
odd
rococo
note
the
lower
broadway
i
allude
to
the
whole
fourth
street
and
bond
street
where
now
the
bond
street
of
that
antiquity
was
then
a
seat
of
education
since
we
had
not
done
with
it
as
i
shall
presently
show
even
when
we
had
done
with
the
institution
a
prompt
disillusionment
and
i
brood
thus
over
a
period
which
strikes
me
as
long
and
during
which
my
personal
hours
of
diligence
were
somehow
more
than
anything
else
hours
of
the
pavement
and
the
shopfront
or
of
such
contemplative
exercise
as
the
very
considerable
distance
for
small
legs
between
those
regions
and
the
westward
fourteenth
street
might
comprise
pedestrian
gaping
having
been
in
childhood
as
i
have
noted
prevailingly
my
line
fate
appeared
to
have
kindly
provided
for
it
on
no
small
scale
to
the
extent
even
that
it
must
have
been
really
my
sole
and
single
form
of
athletics
vague
heated
competition
and
agitation
in
the
then
enclosed
union
square
would
seem
to
point
a
little
among
us
all
to
nobler
types
of
motion
but
of
any
basis
for
recreation
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
playground
or
a
the
institution
itself
was
serenely
innocent
this
i
take
again
for
a
note
extraordinarily
mediæval
it
occupied
the
first
and
second
floors
if
i
rightly
remember
of
a
wide
front
that
overhanging
the
endless
thoroughfare
looked
out
on
bouncing
clattering
stages
and
painfully
dragged
carts
and
the
promiscuous
human
shuffle
the
violence
of
repercussions
from
the
new
york
pavement
of
those
years
to
be
further
taken
into
account
and
i
win
it
back
from
every
side
as
in
spite
of
these
aspects
of
garish
publicity
a
dark
and
dreadful
and
withal
quite
absurd
scene
i
see
places
of
that
general
time
even
places
of
confinement
in
a
dusty
golden
light
that
special
memories
of
small
misery
scarce
in
the
least
bedim
and
this
holds
true
of
our
next
and
quite
neighbouring
refuge
the
establishment
of
vergnès
alone
darkles
and
shrinks
to
me
a
sordidly
interior
is
my
main
image
for
it
attenuated
only
by
its
having
very
soon
afterwards
as
a
suffered
ordeal
altogether
lapsed
and
intermitted
faintly
in
the
gloom
i
distinguish
vergnès
himself
quite
old
very
old
indeed
as
i
supposed
him
and
highly
irritated
and
markedly
bristling
though
of
nothing
in
particular
that
happened
to
me
at
his
or
at
anyone
else
hands
have
i
the
scantest
remembrance
what
really
most
happened
no
doubt
was
that
my
brother
and
i
should
both
come
away
with
a
mind
prepared
for
a
perfect
assimilation
of
alphonse
daudet
chronicle
of
jack
years
and
years
later
on
to
make
the
acquaintance
in
that
work
of
the
petits
pays
chauds
among
whom
jack
learnt
the
first
lessons
of
life
was
to
see
the
institution
vergnès
at
once
revive
swarming
as
it
did
with
small
homesick
cubans
and
mexicans
the
complete
failure
of
blondness
that
marks
the
memory
is
doubtless
the
cumulative
effect
of
so
many
of
the
new
york
petits
pays
chauds
preponderantly
brown
and
black
and
conducing
to
a
greasy
gloom
into
this
gloom
i
fear
i
should
see
all
things
recede
together
but
for
a
certain
salient
note
the
fact
that
the
whole
staff
appears
to
have
been
constantly
in
a
rage
from
which
naturally
resulted
the
accent
of
shrillness
the
only
accent
we
could
pick
up
though
we
were
supposed
to
be
learning
for
the
extreme
importance
of
it
quantities
of
french
and
the
sound
of
high
vociferation
i
remember
infuriated
ushers
of
foreign
speech
and
flushed
complexion
the
tearing
across
of
hapless
exercises
and
and
the
hurtle
through
the
air
of
dodged
volumes
only
never
despite
this
the
extremity
of
smiting
there
can
have
been
at
the
institution
no
blows
instructionally
dealt
nor
even
from
our
hours
of
ease
do
any
such
echoes
come
back
to
me
little
cubans
and
mexicans
i
make
out
were
not
to
be
vulgarly
whacked
in
deference
presumably
to
some
latent
relic
or
imputed
survival
of
castilian
pride
which
would
impose
withal
considerations
of
quite
practical
prudence
food
for
reflection
and
comparison
might
well
have
been
so
suggested
interesting
at
least
the
element
of
contrast
between
such
opposed
conceptions
of
tone
temper
and
manner
as
the
passion
without
whacks
or
with
whacks
only
of
inanimate
objects
ruling
the
scene
i
have
described
and
the
whacks
without
passion
the
grim
impersonal
strictly
penal
applications
of
the
rod
which
then
generally
represented
what
was
still
involved
in
our
english
tradition
it
was
the
two
theories
of
sensibility
of
personal
dignity
that
so
diverged
but
with
such
other
divergences
now
on
top
of
those
that
the
old
comparison
falls
away
we
go
unwhacked
altogether
though
from
a
pride
other
than
castilian
it
is
difficult
to
say
at
least
what
ideal
has
thus
triumphed
in
the
vergnès
air
at
any
rate
i
seem
myself
to
have
sat
unscathed
and
unterrified
not
alarmed
even
by
so
much
as
a
call
to
the
blackboard
only
protected
by
my
insignificance
which
yet
covered
such
a
sense
of
our
dusky
squalor
queer
for
us
the
whole
affair
assuredly
but
how
much
queerer
for
the
poor
petits
pays
chauds
who
had
come
so
far
for
their
privilege
had
come
comparatively
but
from
round
the
corner
and
that
left
the
state
of
education
and
the
range
of
selection
all
about
as
quaint
enough
what
could
these
things
then
have
been
in
the
various
native
climes
of
the
petits
pays
chauds
it
was
by
some
strong
wave
of
reaction
clearly
that
we
were
floated
next
into
the
quieter
haven
of
richard
pulling
jenks
where
cleaner
waters
as
i
feel
their
coolness
still
must
have
filled
a
neater
though
it
was
true
slightly
more
contracted
trough
yet
the
range
of
selection
had
been
even
on
this
higher
plane
none
too
strikingly
exemplified
our
jumping
had
scant
compass
we
still
grubbed
with
a
good
conscience
in
broadway
and
sidled
about
fourth
street
but
i
think
of
the
higher
education
as
having
there
from
various
causes
none
the
less
begun
to
glimmer
for
us
a
diffused
brightness
a
kind
of
high
crosslight
of
conflicting
windows
rests
for
me
at
all
events
on
the
little
realm
of
mr
pulling
jenks
and
bathes
it
as
with
positively
sweet
limitations
limited
must
it
have
been
i
feel
with
our
couple
of
middling
rooms
front
and
back
our
close
packing
our
large
unaccommodating
stove
our
grey
and
gritty
oilcloth
and
again
our
importunate
broadway
from
the
aggregation
of
which
elements
there
distils
itself
without
my
being
able
to
account
for
it
a
certain
perversity
of
romance
i
speak
indeed
here
for
myself
in
particular
and
keen
for
romance
must
i
have
been
in
such
conditions
i
admit
since
the
sense
of
it
had
crept
into
a
recreational
desert
even
as
utter
as
that
of
the
institution
vergnès
up
out
of
broadway
we
still
scrambled
i
can
smell
the
steep
and
cold
and
dusty
wooden
staircase
straight
into
broadway
we
dropped
i
feel
again
the
generalised
glare
of
liberation
and
i
scarce
know
what
tenuity
of
spirit
it
argues
that
i
should
neither
have
enjoyed
nor
been
aware
of
missing
speaking
again
for
myself
only
a
space
wider
than
the
schoolroom
floor
to
react
and
knock
about
in
i
literally
conclude
that
we
must
have
knocked
about
in
broadway
and
in
broadway
alone
like
perfect
little
men
of
the
world
we
must
have
been
let
loose
there
to
stretch
our
legs
and
fill
our
lungs
without
prejudice
either
to
our
earlier
and
later
freedoms
of
going
and
coming
i
as
strictly
infer
at
the
same
time
that
broadway
must
have
been
then
as
one
of
the
alleys
of
eden
for
any
sinister
contact
or
consequence
involved
for
us
a
circumstance
that
did
in
the
least
interfere
too
as
i
have
noted
with
its
offer
of
an
entrancing
interest
the
interest
verily
could
have
been
a
thing
on
the
part
of
our
dear
parents
as
little
as
on
that
of
jenks
himself
therefore
let
it
be
recorded
as
still
most
odd
that
we
should
all
have
assented
to
such
deficiency
of
landscape
such
exiguity
of
sport
i
take
the
true
inwardness
of
the
matter
to
have
been
in
our
having
such
short
hours
long
as
they
may
have
appeared
at
the
time
that
the
day
left
margin
at
the
worst
for
private
inventions
i
think
we
found
landscape
for
ourselves
and
wherever
i
at
least
found
vision
i
found
such
sport
as
i
was
capable
of
even
between
the
front
and
back
rooms
and
the
conflicting
windows
even
by
the
stove
which
somehow
scorched
without
warming
and
yet
round
which
coe
and
dolmidge
the
and
the
arriving
of
a
winter
day
used
notedly
and
in
the
case
of
coe
lamentedly
to
draw
out
their
delays
is
the
dusty
golden
light
of
retrospect
in
this
connection
an
effluence
from
dolmidge
and
coe
whose
ministrations
come
back
to
me
as
the
sole
directly
desired
or
invoked
ones
i
was
to
know
in
my
years
such
as
they
were
of
pupilage
i
see
them
in
any
case
as
images
figures
of
an
antique
stamp
products
must
they
have
been
of
an
order
in
which
some
social
relativity
or
adjustment
some
transmitted
form
and
pressure
were
still
at
work
dolmidge
inordinately
lean
as
was
comparatively
uncommon
then
and
in
a
coat
and
i
think
a
black
satin
stock
was
surely
perfect
in
his
absolutely
functional
way
a
pure
of
a
man
melancholy
and
mild
who
taught
the
most
complicated
flourishes
great
scrolls
of
them
met
our
view
in
the
form
of
surging
seas
and
beaked
and
eagles
the
eagle
being
so
calligraphic
a
bird
while
he
might
just
have
taught
resignation
he
was
not
at
all
funny
no
one
out
of
our
immediate
family
circle
in
fact
almost
no
one
but
himself
who
flowered
in
every
waste
seems
to
have
struck
me
as
funny
in
those
years
but
he
was
to
remain
with
me
a
picture
of
somebody
in
dickens
one
of
the
phiz
if
not
the
cruikshank
pictures
coe
was
another
affair
bristling
with
the
question
of
the
hard
but
somehow
too
with
the
revelation
of
the
soft
the
deeply
attaching
a
worthy
of
immense
stature
and
presence
crowned
as
with
the
thick
white
hair
of
genius
wearing
a
great
gathered
or
puckered
cloak
with
a
vast
velvet
collar
and
resembling
as
he
comes
back
to
me
the
general
winfield
scott
who
lived
so
much
in
our
eyes
then
the
oddity
may
well
even
at
that
hour
have
been
present
to
me
of
its
taking
so
towering
a
person
to
produce
such
small
it
was
as
if
some
mighty
bird
had
laid
diminutive
eggs
coe
of
a
truth
laid
his
all
over
the
place
and
though
they
were
not
of
more
than
handy
size
very
small
boys
could
set
them
up
in
state
on
very
small
desks
they
had
doubtless
a
great
range
of
number
and
effect
they
were
scattered
far
abroad
and
i
surmise
celebrated
they
represented
crooked
cottages
feathery
trees
browsing
and
bristling
beasts
and
other
rural
objects
all
rendered
as
i
recall
them
in
little
detached
dashes
that
were
like
stories
told
in
words
of
one
syllable
or
even
more
perhaps
in
short
gasps
of
delight
it
must
have
been
a
stammering
art
but
i
admired
its
fluency
which
swims
for
me
moreover
in
richer
though
slightly
vague
associations
coe
practised
on
a
larger
scale
in
colour
in
oils
producing
wondrous
neat
little
boards
that
make
me
to
this
day
think
of
them
and
more
particularly
smell
them
when
i
hear
of
a
panel
picture
a
glamour
of
greatness
attends
them
as
brought
home
by
from
the
master
own
place
of
instruction
in
that
old
university
building
which
partly
formed
the
east
side
of
washington
square
and
figures
to
memory
or
to
fond
imagination
as
throbbing
with
more
offices
and
functions
a
denser
chiaroscuro
than
any
reared
hugeness
of
where
character
is
so
lost
in
quantity
is
there
any
present
structure
that
plays
such
a
part
in
proportion
to
its
size
though
even
as
i
ask
the
question
i
feel
how
nothing
on
earth
is
proportioned
to
present
sizes
these
alone
are
proportioned
and
to
mere
and
mere
amount
amount
of
steel
and
stone
which
is
comparatively
uninteresting
perhaps
our
needs
and
our
elements
were
then
absurdly
were
then
provincially
few
and
that
the
patches
of
character
in
that
small
grey
granite
compendium
were
all
we
had
in
general
to
exhibit
let
me
add
at
any
rate
that
some
of
them
were
exhibitional
even
to
my
tender
years
i
mean
since
i
respond
even
yet
to
my
privilege
of
presence
at
some
commencement
or
commemoration
such
as
might
be
natural
doubtless
to
any
university
where
as
under
a
high
rich
roof
before
a
chancellor
in
a
gown
and
amid
serried
admirers
and
impressive
applause
there
was
speaking
of
the
finest
sort
and
where
above
all
i
gathered
in
as
a
dazzling
example
the
rare
assurance
of
young
winthrop
somebody
or
somebody
winthrop
who
though
still
in
jackets
held
us
spellbound
by
his
rendering
of
serjeant
exposure
of
pickwick
long
was
i
to
marvel
at
the
high
sufficiency
of
young
winthrop
somebody
or
somebody
winthrop
in
which
romantic
impression
it
is
perhaps
after
all
though
with
the
consecration
of
one
or
two
of
the
novels
of
the
theodore
of
that
name
which
so
remarkably
insists
thrown
in
the
sense
of
the
place
is
embalmed
i
must
not
forget
indeed
that
i
throw
in
also
coe
even
if
with
less
assured
a
hand
by
way
of
a
note
on
those
higher
flights
of
power
and
promise
that
i
at
this
time
began
to
see
definitely
determined
in
my
brother
as
i
catch
w
j
image
from
far
back
at
its
most
characteristic
he
sits
drawing
and
drawing
always
drawing
especially
under
the
lamplight
of
the
fourteenth
street
back
parlour
and
not
as
with
a
plodding
patience
which
i
think
would
less
have
affected
me
but
easily
freely
and
as
who
should
say
infallibly
always
at
the
stage
of
finishing
off
his
head
dropped
from
side
to
side
and
his
tongue
rubbing
his
lower
lip
i
recover
a
period
during
which
to
see
him
at
all
was
so
to
see
him
the
other
flights
and
faculties
removed
him
from
my
view
these
were
a
matter
of
course
he
recurred
he
passed
nearer
but
in
his
moments
of
ease
and
i
clearly
quite
accepted
the
ease
of
his
disappearances
did
he
always
when
within
my
view
light
them
up
and
justify
them
by
renewed
and
enlarged
vividness
so
that
my
whole
sense
of
him
as
formed
for
assimilations
scarce
conceivable
made
our
gaps
of
contact
too
natural
for
me
even
to
be
lessons
in
humility
humility
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
as
little
even
as
envy
would
have
had
i
was
below
humility
just
as
we
were
together
outside
of
competition
mutually
hors
concours
competitions
were
with
others
in
which
how
was
he
how
could
he
not
be
successful
while
mine
were
with
nobody
or
nobody
with
me
which
came
to
the
same
thing
as
heaven
knows
i
neither
braved
them
nor
missed
them
that
winter
as
i
recover
it
represents
him
as
sufficiently
within
view
to
make
his
position
or
whereabouts
in
the
upper
air
definite
i
must
have
taken
it
for
granted
before
but
could
now
in
a
manner
measure
it
and
the
freshness
of
this
sense
something
serene
in
my
complacency
had
to
do
i
divine
with
the
effect
of
our
moving
with
the
rest
of
our
company
which
was
not
numerous
but
practically
but
appreciably
select
on
a
higher
and
fairer
plane
than
ever
yet
predominantly
of
course
we
owed
this
benefit
to
richard
pulling
himself
of
whom
i
recall
my
brother
saying
to
me
at
a
considerably
later
time
and
with
an
authority
that
affected
me
as
absolute
that
he
had
been
of
all
our
masters
the
most
truly
genial
in
fact
the
only
one
to
whom
the
art
of
exciting
an
interest
or
inspiring
a
sympathy
could
be
in
any
degree
imputed
i
take
this
to
have
meant
that
he
would
have
adorned
a
higher
sphere
and
it
may
have
been
to
explain
his
so
soon
swimming
out
of
our
ken
that
into
a
higher
sphere
he
rapidly
moved
i
can
account
at
least
for
our
falling
away
from
him
the
very
next
year
and
declining
again
upon
baser
things
and
a
lower
civilisation
but
by
some
probability
of
his
flight
just
thereafter
effected
to
a
greater
distance
to
one
of
the
far
upper
reaches
of
the
town
some
years
must
have
elapsed
and
some
distinction
have
crowned
him
when
being
briefly
in
new
york
together
and
i
called
on
him
of
a
sunday
afternoon
to
find
what
i
had
been
at
all
sure
of
that
he
still
quite
knew
who
we
were
or
handsomely
pretended
to
handsomely
in
spite
of
his
markedly
confirmed
identity
of
appearance
with
the
punch
husband
to
judy
of
the
funny
papers
and
the
street
show
bald
rotund
of
ruddy
complexion
with
the
nose
the
chin
the
arched
eye
the
paunch
and
the
to
say
nothing
of
the
ferule
nursed
in
his
arms
and
with
which
in
the
show
such
free
play
is
made
jenks
yet
seems
to
me
to
have
preserved
a
dignity
as
well
as
projected
an
image
and
in
fact
have
done
other
things
besides
he
whacked
occasionally
he
must
have
been
one
of
the
last
of
the
whackers
but
i
do
remember
it
as
ugly
or
dreadful
or
droll
do
remember
that
is
either
directly
feeling
or
reflectively
enjoying
it
it
fails
somehow
to
break
the
spell
of
our
civilisation
my
share
in
which
however
comes
back
to
me
as
merely
contemplative
it
is
beyond
measure
odd
doubtless
that
my
main
association
with
my
studies
whether
of
the
infant
or
the
adolescent
order
should
be
with
almost
anything
but
the
fact
of
learning
of
learning
i
mean
what
i
was
supposed
to
learn
i
could
only
have
been
busy
at
the
same
time
with
other
pursuits
which
must
have
borne
some
superficial
likeness
at
least
to
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
of
a
free
irresponsible
sort
since
i
remember
few
either
of
the
inward
pangs
or
the
outward
pains
of
a
merely
graceless
state
i
recognise
at
the
same
time
that
it
was
perhaps
a
sorry
business
to
be
so
interested
in
one
did
know
what
such
are
whether
at
the
worst
or
at
the
best
some
of
the
aspects
of
that
season
as
jenks
image
presides
in
the
light
of
which
i
perhaps
again
rather
wonder
at
my
imputation
to
the
general
picture
of
so
much
amenity
clearly
the
good
man
was
a
civiliser
whacks
and
all
and
by
some
art
not
now
to
be
detected
he
was
a
complacent
classic
which
was
what
my
brother
claim
for
him
i
dare
say
mostly
represented
though
that
passed
over
the
head
of
my
tenth
year
it
was
a
good
note
for
him
in
this
particular
that
deploring
the
facile
of
doctor
anthon
of
columbia
college
in
which
there
was
even
more
crib
than
text
and
holding
fast
to
the
sterner
discipline
of
andrews
and
stoddard
and
of
that
other
more
conservative
commentator
he
too
doubtless
long
since
superseded
whose
name
i
blush
to
forget
i
think
in
fine
of
richard
pulling
small
but
sincere
academy
as
a
consistent
little
protest
against
its
big
and
easy
and
quite
rival
the
columbia
college
school
apparently
in
those
days
quite
the
favourite
of
fortune
xvi
i
must
in
some
degree
have
felt
it
a
charm
there
that
we
were
not
under
his
rule
inordinately
prepared
for
business
but
were
on
the
contrary
to
remember
that
the
taste
of
cornelius
nepos
in
the
air
even
rather
stale
though
it
may
have
been
had
lacked
the
black
bitterness
marking
our
next
ordeal
and
that
i
conceive
to
have
proceeded
from
some
rank
predominance
of
the
theory
and
practice
of
it
had
consorted
with
this
that
we
found
ourselves
by
i
know
not
what
inconsequence
a
pair
of
the
assets
of
a
firm
forest
and
quackenboss
who
carried
on
business
at
the
northwest
corner
of
fourteenth
street
and
sixth
avenue
having
for
the
winter
of
taken
our
education
in
hand
as
their
establishment
had
the
style
so
i
was
conscious
at
the
time
of
its
having
the
general
stamp
and
sense
of
a
shop
a
shop
of
long
standing
of
numerous
clients
of
lively
bustle
and
traffic
the
structure
itself
was
to
my
recent
recognition
still
there
and
more
than
ever
a
shop
with
improvements
and
extensions
but
dealing
in
other
wares
than
those
anciently
and
as
i
suppose
then
quite
freshly
purveyed
so
far
at
least
as
freshness
was
imputable
to
the
senior
member
of
the
firm
who
had
come
down
to
our
generation
from
a
legendary
past
and
with
a
striking
resemblance
of
head
and
general
air
to
benjamin
franklin
forest
under
whose
more
particular
attention
i
languished
had
lasted
on
from
a
plainer
age
and
having
formed
by
the
legend
in
their
youth
the
taste
of
two
or
three
of
our
new
york
uncles
though
for
what
it
could
have
been
goodness
only
knew
was
still
of
a
to
whack
in
the
fine
old
way
at
their
nephews
and
sons
i
see
him
aloft
benevolent
and
hard
mildly
massive
in
a
black
dress
coat
and
trousers
and
a
white
neckcloth
that
should
have
figured
if
it
did
a
frill
and
on
the
highest
rostrum
of
our
experience
whence
he
comes
back
to
me
as
the
dryest
of
all
our
founts
of
knowledge
though
quite
again
as
a
link
with
manners
and
forms
and
as
the
most
historic
figure
we
had
ever
had
to
do
with
as
i
distinguish
had
in
truth
scarcely
to
do
with
him
lost
again
on
upper
floors
in
higher
classes
in
real
pursuits
and
connecting
me
in
an
indirect
and
almost
deprecated
manner
with
a
strange
curly
glossy
an
anointed
and
bearded
quackenboss
the
junior
partner
who
conducted
the
classical
department
and
never
whacked
only
sent
down
his
subjects
with
every
confidence
to
his
friend
i
make
out
with
clearness
that
forest
was
awful
and
arid
and
yet
that
somehow
by
the
same
stroke
we
did
under
his
sway
go
in
terror
only
went
exceedingly
in
want
even
if
in
want
indeed
of
i
scarce
for
myself
know
what
since
it
might
well
have
been
enough
for
me
in
so
resounding
an
air
to
escape
with
nothing
worse
than
a
failure
of
thrill
if
i
did
feel
that
interest
i
must
clearly
not
have
inspired
it
and
i
marvel
afresh
under
these
memories
at
the
few
points
at
which
i
appear
to
have
touched
constituted
reality
that
however
is
a
different
connection
altogether
and
i
read
back
into
the
one
i
have
been
noting
much
of
the
chill
or
at
least
the
indifference
of
a
foreseen
and
foredoomed
detachment
it
was
during
that
winter
that
i
began
to
live
by
anticipation
in
another
world
and
to
feel
our
uneasy
connection
with
new
york
loosen
beyond
recovery
i
remember
for
how
many
months
when
the
rupture
took
place
we
had
been
to
my
particular
consciousness
virtually
in
motion
though
i
regain
at
the
same
time
the
impression
of
more
experience
on
the
spot
than
had
marked
our
small
previous
history
this
however
a
branch
of
the
matter
that
i
must
for
the
moment
brush
aside
for
it
would
have
been
meanwhile
odd
enough
to
hold
us
in
arrest
a
moment
that
quality
of
our
situation
that
could
suffer
such
elements
as
those
i
have
glanced
at
to
take
so
considerably
the
place
of
education
as
more
usually
and
conventionally
understood
and
by
that
understanding
more
earnestly
mapped
out
a
deficiency
in
the
whole
thing
that
i
fail
at
all
consistently
to
deplore
however
struck
as
i
am
with
the
rare
fashion
after
which
in
any
small
victim
of
life
the
inward
perversity
may
work
it
works
by
converting
to
its
uses
things
vain
and
unintended
to
the
great
discomposure
of
their
prepared
opposites
which
it
by
the
same
stroke
so
often
reduces
to
naught
with
the
result
indeed
that
one
may
most
of
all
see
it
so
at
least
have
i
quite
exclusively
seen
it
the
little
life
out
for
its
chance
as
proceeding
by
the
inveterate
process
of
conversion
as
i
reconsider
both
my
own
and
my
brother
early
start
even
his
too
made
under
stronger
propulsions
it
is
quite
for
me
as
if
the
authors
of
our
being
and
guardians
of
our
youth
had
virtually
said
to
us
but
one
thing
directed
our
course
but
by
one
word
though
constantly
repeated
convert
convert
convert
with
which
i
have
not
even
the
sense
of
any
needed
appeal
in
us
for
further
apprehension
of
the
particular
precious
metal
our
chemistry
was
to
have
in
view
i
taste
again
in
that
pure
air
no
ghost
of
a
hint
for
instance
that
the
precious
metal
was
the
refined
gold
of
success
a
reward
of
effort
for
which
i
remember
to
have
heard
at
home
no
good
word
nor
any
sort
of
word
ever
faintly
breathed
it
was
a
case
of
the
presumption
that
we
should
hear
words
enough
abundantly
elsewhere
so
that
any
dignity
the
idea
might
claim
was
in
the
first
place
not
worth
insisting
on
and
in
the
second
might
well
be
overstated
we
were
to
convert
and
convert
success
in
the
sense
that
was
in
the
general
air
or
no
success
and
simply
everything
that
should
happen
to
us
every
contact
every
impression
and
every
experience
we
should
know
were
to
form
our
soluble
stuff
with
only
ourselves
to
thank
should
we
remain
unaware
by
the
time
our
perceptions
were
decently
developed
of
the
substance
finally
projected
and
most
desirable
that
substance
might
be
just
consummately
virtue
as
a
social
grace
and
value
and
as
a
matter
furthermore
on
which
pretexts
for
ambiguity
of
view
and
of
measure
were
as
little
as
possible
called
upon
to
flourish
this
last
luxury
therefore
quite
failed
us
and
we
understood
no
whit
the
less
what
was
suggested
and
expected
because
of
the
highly
liberal
way
in
which
the
pill
if
i
may
call
it
so
was
gilded
it
had
been
made
up
to
emphasise
my
image
in
so
bright
an
air
of
humanity
and
gaiety
of
charity
and
humour
what
i
speak
of
is
the
medium
itself
of
course
that
we
were
most
immediately
steeped
in
i
am
glancing
now
at
no
particular
turn
of
our
young
attitude
in
it
and
i
can
scarce
sufficiently
express
how
little
it
could
have
conduced
to
the
formation
of
prigs
our
father
prime
horror
was
of
he
only
cared
for
virtue
that
was
more
or
less
ashamed
of
itself
and
nothing
could
have
been
of
a
happier
whimsicality
than
the
mixture
in
him
and
in
all
his
walk
and
conversation
of
the
strongest
instinct
for
the
human
and
the
liveliest
reaction
from
the
literal
the
literal
played
in
our
education
as
small
a
part
as
it
perhaps
ever
played
in
any
and
we
wholesomely
breathed
inconsistency
and
ate
and
drank
contradictions
the
presence
of
paradox
was
so
bright
among
us
though
fluttering
ever
with
as
light
a
wing
and
as
short
a
flight
as
need
have
been
that
we
fairly
grew
used
to
allow
from
an
early
time
for
the
so
many
and
odd
declarations
we
heard
launched
to
the
extent
of
happily
discounting
them
the
moral
of
all
of
which
was
that
we
need
never
fear
not
to
be
good
enough
if
we
were
only
social
enough
a
splendid
meaning
indeed
being
attached
to
the
latter
term
thus
we
had
ever
the
amusement
since
i
can
really
call
it
nothing
less
of
hearing
morality
or
moralism
as
it
was
more
invidiously
worded
made
hay
of
in
the
very
interest
of
character
and
conduct
these
things
suffering
much
it
seemed
by
their
association
with
the
conscience
that
is
the
conscience
the
very
home
of
the
literal
the
haunt
of
so
many
pedantries
pedantries
on
all
this
ground
were
anathema
and
if
our
dear
parent
had
at
all
minded
his
not
being
consistent
and
had
entertained
about
us
generally
less
passionate
an
optimism
not
an
easy
but
an
arduous
state
in
him
moreover
he
might
have
found
it
difficult
to
apply
to
the
promotion
of
our
studies
so
free
a
suspicion
of
the
inhumanity
of
method
method
certainly
never
quite
raged
among
us
but
it
was
our
fortune
nevertheless
that
everything
had
its
turn
and
that
such
indifferences
were
no
more
pedantic
than
certain
rigours
might
perhaps
have
been
of
all
of
which
odd
notes
of
our
situation
there
would
and
possibly
will
be
more
to
say
my
present
aim
is
really
but
to
testify
to
what
most
comes
up
for
me
in
the
queer
educative
air
i
have
been
trying
to
breathe
again
that
definite
reflection
is
that
if
we
had
not
had
in
us
to
some
degree
the
root
of
the
matter
no
method
however
confessedly
or
aggressively
pedantic
would
much
have
availed
for
us
and
that
since
we
apparently
did
have
it
deep
down
and
inert
in
our
small
patches
of
virgin
soil
the
fashion
after
which
it
struggled
forth
was
an
experience
as
intense
as
any
other
and
a
record
of
as
great
a
dignity
it
may
be
asked
me
i
recognise
of
the
root
of
what
matter
i
so
complacently
speak
and
if
i
say
why
of
the
matter
of
our
having
with
considerable
intensity
educable
or
if
you
like
better
teachable
that
is
accessible
to
experience
it
may
again
be
retorted
that
wo
do
for
a
decent
account
of
a
young
consciousness
for
think
of
all
the
things
that
the
failure
of
method
of
which
you
make
so
light
did
put
into
yours
think
of
the
splendid
economy
of
a
real
or
at
least
of
a
planned
and
attempted
education
a
course
of
instruction
and
then
think
of
the
waste
involved
in
the
so
inferior
substitute
of
which
the
pair
of
you
were
evidently
victims
an
admonition
this
on
which
i
brood
less
however
than
on
the
still
other
sense
rising
from
the
whole
retrospect
of
my
now
feeling
sure
of
my
having
mastered
the
particular
history
of
just
that
waste
to
the
point
of
its
actually
affecting
me
as
blooming
with
interest
to
the
point
even
of
its
making
me
ask
myself
how
in
the
world
if
the
question
is
of
the
injection
of
more
things
into
the
consciousness
as
would
seem
the
case
mine
could
have
done
with
more
thanks
to
its
small
trick
perhaps
vicious
i
admit
of
having
felt
itself
from
an
early
time
almost
uncomfortably
stuffed
i
see
my
critic
by
whom
i
mean
my
representative
of
method
at
any
price
take
in
this
plea
only
to
crush
it
with
his
confidence
that
without
the
signal
effects
of
method
one
must
have
had
by
an
inexorable
law
to
resort
to
shifts
and
ingenuities
and
can
therefore
only
have
been
an
artful
dodger
more
or
less
successfully
dodging
i
take
full
account
of
the
respectability
of
the
prejudice
against
one
or
two
of
the
uses
to
which
the
intelligence
may
at
a
pinch
be
put
the
criminal
use
in
particular
of
falsifying
its
history
of
forging
its
records
even
and
of
appearing
greater
than
the
traceable
grounds
warrant
one
can
but
fall
back
none
the
less
on
the
particular
of
grounds
when
it
comes
to
that
cases
abound
so
in
which
with
the
grounds
all
there
the
intelligence
itself
is
not
to
be
identified
i
contend
for
nothing
moreover
but
the
lively
interest
of
the
view
and
above
all
of
the
measure
of
almost
any
mental
history
after
the
fact
of
less
interest
comparatively
is
that
sight
of
the
mind
before
the
demonstration
of
the
fact
that
is
and
while
still
muffled
in
theories
and
presumptions
purple
and
fine
linen
and
as
such
highly
becoming
though
these
be
of
what
shall
prove
best
for
it
which
doubtless
too
numerous
remarks
have
been
determined
by
my
sense
of
the
tenuity
of
some
of
my
clues
i
had
begun
to
count
our
wavering
steps
from
so
very
far
back
and
with
a
lively
disposition
i
confess
not
to
miss
even
the
vaguest
of
them
i
can
scarce
indeed
overstate
the
vagueness
that
quite
to
attend
a
great
number
in
presence
of
the
fact
that
our
father
caring
for
our
spiritual
decency
unspeakably
more
than
for
anything
else
anything
at
all
that
might
be
or
might
become
ours
would
have
seemed
to
regard
this
cultivation
of
it
as
profession
and
career
enough
for
us
had
he
but
betrayed
more
interest
in
our
mastery
of
art
or
craft
it
was
not
certainly
that
the
profession
of
virtue
would
have
been
anything
less
than
abhorrent
to
him
but
that
singular
though
the
circumstance
there
were
times
when
he
might
have
struck
us
as
having
after
all
more
patience
with
it
than
with
this
that
or
the
other
more
technical
thrifty
scheme
of
the
beauty
of
his
dissimulated
anxiety
and
tenderness
on
these
and
various
other
suchlike
heads
however
other
examples
will
arise
for
i
see
him
now
as
fairly
afraid
to
recognise
certain
anxieties
fairly
declining
to
dabble
in
the
harshness
of
practical
precautions
or
impositions
the
effect
of
his
attitude
so
little
thought
out
as
shrewd
or
as
vulgarly
providential
but
in
spite
of
this
so
socially
and
affectionally
founded
could
only
be
to
make
life
interesting
to
us
at
the
worst
in
default
of
making
it
extraordinarily
paying
he
had
a
theory
that
it
would
somehow
or
other
always
be
paying
enough
and
this
much
less
by
any
poor
conception
of
our
wants
for
he
delighted
in
our
wants
and
so
sympathetically
and
sketchily
and
summarily
wanted
us
than
by
a
happy
and
friendly
though
slightly
nebulous
conception
of
our
resources
delighting
ever
in
the
truth
while
generously
contemptuous
of
the
facts
so
far
as
we
might
make
the
difference
the
facts
having
a
way
of
being
many
and
the
truth
remaining
but
one
he
held
that
there
would
always
be
enough
since
the
truth
the
true
truth
was
never
ugly
and
dreadful
and
we
did
and
would
depart
from
it
by
any
cruelty
or
stupidity
for
he
would
have
had
us
stupid
and
might
therefore
depend
on
it
for
due
abundance
even
of
meat
and
drink
and
raiment
even
of
wisdom
and
wit
and
honour
it
is
too
much
to
say
that
our
so
preponderantly
humanised
and
socialised
adolescence
was
to
make
us
look
out
for
these
things
with
a
subtle
indirectness
but
i
return
to
my
proposition
that
there
may
still
be
a
charm
in
seeing
such
hazards
at
work
through
a
given
even
if
not
in
a
systematised
case
my
cases
are
of
course
given
so
that
economy
of
observation
after
the
fact
as
i
have
called
it
becomes
inspiring
not
less
than
the
amusement
or
whatever
it
may
be
of
the
question
of
what
might
happen
of
what
in
point
of
fact
did
happen
to
several
very
towny
and
domesticated
little
persons
who
were
confirmed
in
their
towniness
and
fairly
enriched
in
their
sensibility
instead
of
being
chucked
into
a
scramble
or
exposed
on
breezy
uplands
under
the
of
competition
and
discipline
perhaps
any
success
that
attended
the
experiment
which
was
really
as
i
have
hinted
no
plotted
thing
at
all
but
only
an
accident
of
accidents
proceeded
just
from
the
fact
that
the
small
subjects
a
defeated
romulus
a
prematurely
sacrificed
remus
had
in
their
very
sensibility
an
asset
as
we
have
come
to
say
a
principle
of
life
and
even
of
fun
perhaps
on
the
other
hand
the
success
would
have
been
greater
with
less
of
that
particular
complication
or
facilitation
and
more
of
some
other
which
i
shall
be
at
a
loss
to
identify
what
i
find
in
my
path
happens
to
be
the
fact
of
the
sensibility
and
from
the
light
it
sheds
the
curious
as
also
the
common
things
that
did
from
occasion
to
occasion
play
into
it
seem
each
to
borrow
a
separate
and
vivifying
glow
as
at
the
institution
vergnès
and
at
mr
pulling
jenks
however
this
might
be
so
at
forest
or
in
other
words
at
the
more
numerous
establishment
of
forest
and
quackenboss
where
we
spent
the
winter
of
reality
in
the
form
of
multitudinous
mates
was
to
have
swarmed
about
me
increasingly
at
forest
the
prolonged
in
the
morning
as
i
sit
in
the
vast
bright
crowded
smelly
smoky
room
in
which
rusty
black
were
the
nearest
hint
of
architecture
bristles
with
names
hoes
and
havemeyers
stokeses
phelpses
colgates
and
others
of
a
subsequently
great
new
york
salience
it
was
sociable
and
gay
it
was
sordidly
spectacular
one
was
then
by
an
inch
or
two
a
bigger
boy
though
with
crushing
superiorities
in
that
line
all
round
and
when
i
wonder
why
the
scene
was
sterile
which
was
what
i
took
it
for
at
the
worst
the
reason
glooms
out
again
in
the
dreadful
blight
of
arithmetic
which
affected
me
at
the
time
as
filling
all
the
air
the
quantity
imposed
may
not
in
fact
have
been
positively
gross
yet
it
is
what
i
most
definitely
remember
not
i
mean
that
i
have
retained
the
dimmest
notion
of
the
science
but
only
of
the
dire
image
of
our
being
in
one
way
or
another
always
supposedly
addressed
to
it
i
recall
strange
neighbours
and
deskfellows
who
not
otherwise
too
objectionable
were
uncanny
and
monstrous
through
their
possession
cultivation
imitation
of
ledgers
daybooks
tall
pages
of
figures
interspaces
streaked
with
oblique
ruled
lines
that
weirdly
balanced
whatever
that
might
mean
and
other
like
horrors
nothing
in
truth
is
more
distinct
to
me
than
the
tune
to
which
they
were
without
exception
at
their
ease
on
such
ground
unless
it
be
my
general
dazzled
humiliated
sense
through
those
years
of
the
common
the
baffling
mastery
all
round
me
of
a
hundred
handy
arts
and
devices
everyone
did
things
and
had
things
everyone
knew
how
even
when
it
was
a
question
of
the
small
animals
the
dormice
and
grasshoppers
or
the
hoards
of
food
and
stationery
that
they
kept
in
their
desks
just
as
they
kept
in
their
heads
such
secrets
for
how
to
do
sums
those
secrets
that
i
must
even
then
have
foreseen
i
should
even
so
late
in
life
as
this
have
failed
to
discover
i
may
have
known
things
have
by
that
time
learnt
a
few
myself
but
i
did
know
what
i
did
know
whereas
those
who
surrounded
me
were
all
agog
to
my
vision
with
the
benefit
of
their
knowledge
i
see
them
in
this
light
across
the
years
fairly
grin
and
grimace
with
it
and
the
presumable
vulgarity
of
some
of
them
certain
scattered
shades
of
baseness
still
discernible
comes
to
me
as
but
one
of
the
appearances
of
an
abounding
play
of
genius
who
was
it
i
ever
thought
stupid
even
when
knowing
or
at
least
feeling
that
sundry
expressions
of
life
or
force
which
i
yet
had
no
name
for
represented
somehow
art
without
grace
or
what
after
a
fashion
came
to
the
same
thing
presence
without
type
all
of
which
i
should
add
did
in
the
least
prevent
my
moving
on
the
plane
of
the
remarkable
so
that
if
as
i
have
noted
the
general
blank
of
consciousness
in
the
conditions
of
that
winter
rather
tended
to
spread
this
could
perhaps
have
but
had
for
its
best
reason
that
i
was
fairly
gorged
with
wonders
they
were
too
much
of
the
same
kind
the
result
that
is
of
everyone
seeming
to
know
everything
to
the
effect
a
little
that
everything
suffered
by
it
there
was
a
boy
called
simpson
my
juxtaposition
to
whom
i
recall
as
uninterruptedly
close
and
whose
origin
can
only
have
been
i
think
quite
immediately
irish
and
simpson
i
feel
sure
was
a
friendly
and
helpful
character
yet
even
he
reeked
to
my
sense
with
strange
accomplishment
no
single
show
of
which
but
was
accompanied
in
him
by
a
smart
protrusion
of
the
lower
lip
a
crude
complacency
of
power
that
almost
crushed
me
to
sadness
it
is
as
if
i
had
passed
in
that
sadness
most
of
those
ostensibly
animated
months
an
effect
however
doubtless
in
some
degree
proceeding
for
later
appreciation
from
the
more
intelligible
nearness
of
the
time
it
had
brought
me
to
the
end
of
my
twelfth
year
which
helps
not
a
little
to
turn
it
to
prose
how
i
gave
to
that
state
in
any
case
such
an
air
of
occupation
as
to
beguile
not
only
myself
but
my
instructors
which
i
infer
i
did
from
their
so
intensely
letting
me
alone
i
am
quite
at
a
loss
to
say
i
have
in
truth
mainly
the
remembrance
of
consistently
either
ignored
or
exquisitely
considered
i
know
not
which
to
call
it
even
if
without
the
belief
which
would
explain
it
that
i
passed
for
generally
wanting
any
more
than
for
naturally
odious
it
was
strange
at
all
events
it
could
only
have
been
to
be
so
stupid
without
being
more
brutish
and
so
perceptive
without
being
more
keen
here
were
a
case
and
a
problem
to
which
no
honest
master
with
other
and
better
cases
could
have
felt
justified
in
giving
time
he
would
have
had
at
least
to
be
morbidly
curious
and
i
recall
from
that
sphere
of
rule
no
instance
whatever
of
the
least
refinement
of
inquiry
i
should
even
probably
have
missed
one
of
these
more
flattering
shades
of
attention
had
i
missed
attention
at
all
but
i
think
i
was
never
really
aware
of
how
little
i
got
or
how
much
i
did
without
i
read
back
into
the
whole
connection
indeed
the
chill
or
at
least
the
indifference
of
a
foreseen
and
foredoomed
detachment
i
have
noted
how
at
this
desperate
juncture
the
mild
forces
making
for
our
conscious
relief
pushing
the
door
to
europe
definitely
open
began
at
last
to
be
effective
nothing
seemed
to
matter
at
all
but
that
i
should
become
personally
and
incredibly
acquainted
with
piccadilly
and
richmond
park
and
ham
common
i
regain
at
the
same
time
the
impression
of
more
experience
on
the
spot
than
had
marked
our
small
previous
history
pitiful
as
it
looks
to
these
ampler
days
the
mere
little
fact
that
a
small
court
for
recreation
was
attached
to
our
academy
added
something
of
a
grace
to
life
we
descended
in
relays
for
intermission
into
a
paved
and
walled
yard
of
the
scantest
size
the
only
provision
for
any
such
privilege
not
counting
the
street
itself
of
which
at
the
worst
of
other
conditions
we
must
have
had
free
range
that
i
recover
from
those
years
the
ground
is
built
over
now
but
i
could
still
figure
on
a
recent
occasion
our
small
together
with
my
then
abject
little
sense
that
it
richly
sufficed
or
rather
positively
that
nothing
could
have
been
more
romantic
for
within
our
limit
we
freely
conversed
and
at
nothing
did
i
assist
with
more
interest
than
at
free
conversation
certain
boys
hover
before
me
the
biggest
the
fairest
the
most
worthy
of
freedom
dominating
the
scene
and
scattering
upon
fifty
subjects
the
most
surprising
lights
one
of
these
heroes
whose
stature
and
complexion
are
still
there
for
me
to
admire
did
tricks
of
legerdemain
with
the
scant
apparatus
of
a
handkerchief
a
key
a
as
to
some
one
of
which
it
is
as
fresh
as
yesterday
that
i
ingenuously
invited
him
to
show
me
how
to
do
it
and
then
on
his
treating
me
with
scorn
renewed
without
dignity
my
fond
solicitation
fresher
even
than
yesterday
fadelessly
fresh
for
me
at
this
hour
is
the
cutting
remark
thereupon
of
another
boy
who
certainly
simpson
and
whose
identity
is
lost
for
me
in
his
mere
inspired
authority
oh
oh
oh
i
should
think
you
be
too
proud
i
had
neither
been
too
proud
nor
so
much
as
conceived
that
one
might
be
but
i
remember
well
how
it
flashed
on
me
with
this
that
i
had
failed
thereby
of
a
high
luxury
or
privilege
which
the
whole
future
however
might
help
me
to
make
up
for
to
what
extent
it
helped
is
another
matter
but
so
fine
was
the
force
of
the
suggestion
that
i
think
i
have
never
in
all
the
years
made
certain
returns
upon
my
spirit
without
again
feeling
the
pang
from
the
cool
little
voice
of
the
fourteenth
street
yard
such
was
the
moral
exercise
it
at
least
allowed
us
room
for
it
also
allowed
us
room
to
be
just
for
an
inordinate
consumption
of
hot
waffles
retailed
by
a
benevolent
black
auntie
who
presided
with
her
husband
aid
as
i
remember
at
a
portable
stove
set
up
in
a
passage
or
recess
opening
from
the
court
to
which
we
flocked
and
pushed
in
a
merciless
squeeze
with
all
our
coppers
and
the
products
of
which
the
oblong
farinaceous
compound
faintly
yet
richly
brown
stamped
and
smoking
not
crisp
nor
brittle
but
softly
absorbent
of
the
syrup
dabbed
upon
it
for
a
finish
revealed
to
me
i
for
a
long
time
even
for
a
very
long
time
supposed
the
highest
pleasure
of
sense
we
stamped
about
we
freely
conversed
we
ate
sticky
waffles
by
the
hundred
i
recall
no
worse
acts
of
violence
unless
i
count
as
such
our
intermissional
rushes
to
pynsent
of
the
avenue
a
few
doors
off
in
the
particular
interest
of
a
confection
that
ran
the
waffle
close
as
the
phrase
is
for
popularity
while
even
surpassing
it
for
stickiness
pynsent
was
higher
up
in
the
row
in
which
forest
had
its
front
other
and
dearer
names
have
dropped
from
me
but
pynsent
adheres
with
all
the
force
of
the
strong
saccharine
principle
this
principle
at
its
highest
we
conceived
was
embodied
in
small
mounds
of
chopped
cocoanut
or
whatever
other
substance
if
a
finer
there
be
profusely
lusciously
endued
and
distributed
on
small
tin
trays
in
the
manner
of
haycocks
in
a
field
we
acquired
we
appropriated
we
transported
we
enjoyed
them
they
fairly
formed
perhaps
after
all
our
highest
enjoyment
but
with
consequences
to
our
pockets
and
i
speak
of
those
other
than
financial
with
an
intimacy
a
reciprocity
of
contact
at
any
or
at
every
personal
point
that
i
lose
myself
in
the
thought
of
xvii
i
lose
myself
of
a
truth
under
the
whole
pressure
of
the
spring
of
memory
proceeding
from
recent
revisitings
and
recognitions
the
action
of
the
fact
that
time
until
lately
had
spared
hereabouts
and
may
still
be
sparing
in
the
most
exceptional
way
by
an
anomaly
or
a
mercy
of
the
rarest
in
new
york
a
whole
cluster
of
landmarks
leaving
me
to
spot
and
verify
right
and
left
the
smallest
preserved
particulars
these
things
at
the
pressure
flush
together
again
interweave
their
pattern
and
quite
thrust
it
at
me
the
absurd
little
fusion
of
images
for
a
history
or
a
picture
of
the
time
the
background
of
which
i
see
after
all
so
much
less
as
the
harsh
sixth
avenue
corner
than
as
many
other
matters
those
scant
shades
claimed
us
but
briefly
and
superficially
and
it
comes
back
to
me
that
oddly
enough
in
the
light
of
autumn
afternoons
our
associates
the
most
animated
or
at
any
rate
the
best
put
in
little
figures
of
our
landscape
were
not
our
comparatively
obscure
schoolmates
who
seem
mostly
to
have
swum
out
of
our
ken
between
any
day
and
its
morrow
our
other
companions
those
we
practically
knew
at
home
ignored
our
school
having
better
or
worse
of
their
own
but
peopled
somehow
for
us
the
social
scene
which
figuring
there
for
me
in
documentary
vividness
bristles
with
van
burens
van
winkles
de
peysters
costers
senters
norcoms
robinsons
these
last
composing
round
a
eugene
wards
hunts
and
to
whose
ranks
i
must
add
our
invariable
albert
and
who
swarm
from
up
and
down
and
east
and
west
appearing
to
me
surely
to
have
formed
a
rich
and
various
society
our
salon
it
is
true
was
mainly
the
street
loose
and
rude
and
crude
in
those
days
at
best
though
with
a
rapid
increase
of
redeeming
features
to
the
extent
to
which
the
spread
of
micaceous
brown
stone
could
redeem
as
exhibited
especially
in
the
ample
face
of
the
scotch
presbyterian
church
promptly
rising
just
opposite
our
own
peculiar
row
and
which
it
now
marks
for
me
somewhat
grimly
a
span
of
life
to
have
seen
laboriously
rear
itself
continuously
flourish
and
utterly
disappear
while
in
construction
it
was
only
less
interesting
than
the
of
edward
ferrero
slightly
west
of
it
and
forming
with
it
in
their
embryonic
stage
a
large
and
delightfully
dangerous
adjunct
to
our
playground
though
with
the
distinction
of
coming
much
to
surpass
it
for
interest
in
the
final
phase
while
we
clambered
about
on
ladders
and
toyed
with
the
peril
of
unfloored
abysses
while
we
trespassed
and
pried
and
pervaded
snatching
a
scant
impression
from
sorry
material
enough
clearly
the
sacred
edifice
enjoyed
a
credit
beyond
that
of
the
profane
but
when
both
were
finished
and
opened
we
flocked
to
the
sound
of
the
fiddle
more
freely
it
need
scarce
be
said
than
to
that
of
the
psalm
freely
indeed
in
our
particular
case
scarce
expresses
the
latter
relation
since
our
young
liberty
in
respect
to
was
absolute
and
we
might
range
at
will
through
the
great
city
from
one
place
of
worship
and
one
form
of
faith
to
another
or
might
on
occasion
ignore
them
all
equally
which
was
what
we
mainly
did
whereas
we
rallied
without
a
break
to
the
halls
of
ferrero
a
view
of
the
staringly
and
as
i
supposed
dazzlingly
frescoed
walls
the
internal
economy
the
high
amenity
the
general
æsthetic
and
social
appeal
of
which
still
hangs
in
its
wealth
before
me
mcelroy
uplifting
eyes
strange
accents
and
gaunt
scraggy
chin
squirming
and
swaying
and
in
only
a
shade
more
chastely
adorned
temple
is
distinct
enough
too
just
as
we
enjoyed
this
bleak
intensity
the
more
to
my
personal
vision
through
the
vague
legend
and
no
legend
was
too
vague
for
me
to
cherish
of
his
being
the
next
pastor
in
succession
to
the
one
under
whom
our
mother
thereto
predirected
by
our
good
greatgrandfather
alexander
robertson
already
named
who
was
nothing
if
not
scotch
and
presbyterian
and
authoritative
as
his
brave
old
portrait
by
the
elder
jarves
attests
had
sat
before
her
marriage
the
marriage
so
lamentedly
diverting
her
indeed
from
this
tradition
that
to
mark
the
rueful
rupture
it
had
invoked
one
evening
with
the
aid
of
india
muslin
and
a
wondrous
gold
headband
in
the
maternal
the
washington
square
parlours
but
the
secular
nuptial
consecration
of
the
then
mayor
of
the
city
i
think
varick
we
progeny
were
of
course
after
this
mild
convulsion
not
at
all
in
the
fold
yet
it
strikes
me
as
the
happy
note
of
a
simple
age
that
we
were
practically
of
a
sunday
at
least
wherever
we
might
have
chosen
to
enter
since
going
forth
hand
in
hand
into
the
sunshine
and
i
connect
myself
here
with
my
next
younger
not
with
my
elder
brother
whose
orbit
was
other
and
larger
we
sampled
in
modern
phrase
as
small
unprejudiced
inquirers
obeying
their
inspiration
any
resort
of
any
congregation
detected
by
us
doing
so
i
make
out
moreover
with
a
sense
of
earnest
provision
for
any
contemporary
challenge
what
church
do
you
go
to
the
challenge
took
in
childish
circles
that
searching
form
of
the
form
it
took
among
our
elders
my
impression
is
more
vague
to
which
i
must
add
as
well
that
our
fending
in
this
fashion
for
ourselves
did
so
prepare
us
for
invidious
remark
remark
i
mean
upon
our
pewless
state
which
involved
to
my
imagination
much
the
same
discredit
that
a
houseless
or
a
cookless
would
have
done
as
to
hush
in
my
breast
the
appeal
to
our
parents
not
for
religious
instruction
of
which
we
had
plenty
and
of
the
most
charming
and
familiar
but
simply
for
instruction
a
very
different
thing
as
to
where
we
should
say
we
went
in
our
world
under
cold
scrutiny
or
derisive
comment
it
was
colder
than
any
criticism
i
recall
to
hear
our
father
reply
that
we
could
plead
nothing
less
than
the
whole
privilege
of
christendom
and
that
there
was
no
communion
even
that
of
the
catholics
even
that
of
the
jews
even
that
of
the
swedenborgians
from
which
we
need
find
ourselves
excluded
with
the
freedom
we
enjoyed
our
dilemma
clearly
amused
him
it
would
have
been
impossible
he
affirmed
to
be
theologically
more
how
as
mere
detached
unaccompanied
infants
we
enjoyed
such
impunity
of
range
and
confidence
of
welcome
is
beyond
comprehension
save
by
the
light
of
the
old
manners
and
conditions
the
old
local
bonhomie
the
comparatively
primal
innocence
the
absence
of
complications
with
the
several
notes
of
which
last
beatitude
my
reminiscence
surely
shines
it
was
the
theory
of
the
time
and
place
that
the
young
were
they
but
young
enough
could
take
publicly
no
harm
to
which
adds
itself
moreover
and
touchingly
enough
all
the
difference
of
the
old
importances
it
was
doubtless
that
the
social
or
call
it
simply
the
human
position
of
the
child
was
higher
than
a
circumstance
not
conceivable
it
was
simply
that
other
dignities
and
values
and
claims
other
social
and
human
positions
were
less
definite
and
settled
less
prescriptive
and
absolute
a
rich
sophistication
is
after
all
a
gradual
growth
and
it
would
have
been
sophisticated
to
fear
for
us
before
such
bright
and
vacant
vistas
the
perils
of
the
way
or
to
see
us
received
anywhere
even
with
the
irony
of
patronage
we
had
in
fact
seats
of
honour
but
that
justice
was
done
us
that
is
that
we
were
placed
to
our
advantage
i
infer
from
my
having
liked
so
to
go
even
though
my
grounds
may
have
been
but
the
love
of
the
in
general
thanks
to
which
figures
faces
furniture
sounds
smells
and
colours
became
for
me
wherever
enjoyed
and
enjoyed
most
where
most
collected
a
positive
little
orgy
of
the
senses
and
riot
of
the
mind
let
me
at
the
same
time
make
the
point
that
such
may
be
the
snobbery
of
extreme
youth
i
not
only
failed
quite
to
rise
to
the
parental
reasoning
but
made
out
in
it
rather
a
certain
sophistry
such
a
prevarication
for
instance
as
if
we
had
habitually
said
we
kept
the
carriage
we
observably
did
keep
kept
it
because
we
sent
when
we
wanted
one
to
university
place
where
hathorn
had
his
a
connection
this
last
promoted
by
my
frequent
need
of
the
aid
to
circulate
his
walks
were
limited
through
an
injury
received
in
youth
and
promoting
in
turn
and
at
a
touch
to
my
consciousness
the
stir
of
small
the
smallest
remembered
things
i
recall
the
adventure
no
infrequent
one
of
being
despatched
to
hathorn
to
bespeak
a
conveyance
and
the
very
air
and
odour
the
genial
warmth
at
a
fine
steaming
irish
pitch
of
the
stables
and
their
stamping
and
backing
beasts
their
resounding
boardedness
their
chairs
tipped
up
at
such
an
angle
for
lifted
heels
a
pair
of
which
latter
seek
the
floor
again
at
my
appeal
as
those
of
big
bearded
hathorn
himself
an
impression
enriched
by
the
drive
home
in
lolling
and
bumping
possession
of
the
great
vehicle
and
associated
further
with
sunday
afternoons
in
spring
with
the
question
of
distant
harlem
and
remoter
bloomingdale
with
the
experience
at
one
of
these
junctures
of
hoboken
if
it
was
williamsburg
which
fits
in
fancifully
somewhere
when
the
carriage
was
reinforced
by
a
ferry
and
the
ferry
by
something
something
to
my
present
vision
very
dim
and
dusty
and
archaic
something
quite
ragged
and
graceless
in
the
nature
of
a
public
and
ices
the
finest
link
here
however
is
for
some
reason
with
the
new
york
hotel
and
thereby
with
albany
uncles
thereby
also
with
hathorn
in
person
waiting
and
waiting
expensively
on
his
box
before
the
house
and
somehow
felt
as
attuned
to
albany
uncles
even
as
cannon
had
subtly
struck
me
as
being
intenser
than
these
vague
shades
meanwhile
is
my
vision
of
the
halls
of
ferrero
where
the
orgy
of
the
senses
and
even
the
riot
of
the
mind
of
which
i
have
just
spoken
must
quite
literally
have
led
me
more
of
a
dance
than
anywhere
let
this
sketch
of
a
lost
order
note
withal
that
under
so
scant
a
general
provision
for
infant
exercise
as
distinguished
from
infant
ease
our
hopping
and
sliding
in
tune
had
to
be
deemed
urgent
it
was
the
sense
for
this
form
of
relief
that
clearly
was
general
superseding
as
the
ampler
ferrero
scene
did
previous
limited
exhibitions
even
those
for
that
matter
coming
back
to
me
in
the
ancient
person
of
charriau
i
guess
at
the
writing
of
his
name
whom
i
work
in
but
confusedly
as
a
professional
visitor
a
subject
gaped
at
across
a
gulf
of
fear
in
one
of
our
huddled
schools
all
the
more
that
i
perfectly
evoke
him
as
resembling
with
a
difference
or
two
the
portraits
of
the
aged
voltaire
and
that
he
had
fiddle
in
hand
and
incited
the
young
agility
of
our
mother
and
aunt
edward
ferrero
was
another
matter
in
the
prime
of
life
romantic
and
moustachio
he
was
suddenly
to
figure
on
the
outbreak
of
the
civil
war
as
a
general
of
volunteers
very
much
as
if
he
had
been
one
of
bonaparte
improvised
young
marshals
in
anticipation
of
which
however
he
was
at
all
fierce
or
superior
to
my
remembrance
but
most
kind
to
sprawling
youth
in
a
charming
man
of
the
world
fashion
and
as
if
wanted
but
a
touch
to
become
also
men
of
the
world
remarkably
as
i
say
by
the
measure
of
that
period
and
extraordinarily
agile
he
could
so
gracefully
leap
and
bound
that
his
bounding
into
the
military
saddle
such
occasion
offering
had
all
the
felicity
and
only
wanted
the
pink
fleshings
of
the
circus
he
was
still
more
admired
by
the
mothers
with
whom
he
had
to
my
eyes
a
most
elegant
relation
than
by
the
pupils
among
all
of
whom
at
the
frequent
and
delightful
soirées
he
caused
trays
laden
with
lucent
syrups
repeatedly
to
circulate
the
scale
of
these
entertainments
as
i
figured
it
and
the
florid
frescoes
just
damp
though
they
were
with
newness
and
the
free
lemonade
and
the
freedom
of
remark
equally
great
with
the
mothers
were
the
lavish
note
in
him
just
as
the
fact
that
he
never
himself
fiddled
but
was
followed
over
the
shining
parquet
by
attendant
fiddlers
represented
doubtless
a
shadow
the
less
on
his
later
dignity
so
far
as
that
dignity
was
compassed
dignity
marked
in
full
measure
even
at
the
time
the
presence
of
his
sister
madame
dubreuil
a
handsome
authoritative
person
who
instructed
us
equally
in
fact
preponderantly
and
who
though
comparatively
not
sympathetic
so
engaged
physiognomically
my
wondering
interest
that
i
hear
to
this
hour
her
shrill
accent
do
look
at
little
boy
look
at
my
feet
i
see
them
now
these
somewhat
fat
members
beneath
the
uplifted
skirt
encased
in
bronzed
slippers
without
heels
but
attached
by
graceful
over
her
white
stockings
to
her
solid
ankles
an
emphatic
sign
of
the
time
not
less
than
i
recover
my
surprised
sense
of
their
supporting
her
without
loss
of
balance
substantial
as
she
was
in
the
first
position
her
command
of
which
her
ankles
clapped
close
together
and
her
body
very
erect
was
so
perfect
that
even
with
her
toes
right
and
left
fairly
turning
the
corner
backward
she
never
fell
prone
on
her
face
it
consorted
somehow
with
this
wealth
of
resource
in
her
that
she
appeared
at
the
soirées
or
at
least
at
the
great
soirée
in
which
the
historic
truth
of
my
experience
free
lemonade
and
all
is
doubtless
really
shut
up
as
the
genius
of
california
a
dazzling
vision
of
white
satin
and
golden
flounces
her
brother
meanwhile
maintaining
that
more
distinctively
european
colour
which
i
feel
to
have
been
for
my
young
presumption
the
convincing
essence
of
the
scene
in
the
character
of
a
mousquetaire
de
louis
quinze
highly
consonant
with
his
type
there
hovered
in
the
background
a
flushed
and
tawnily
dubreuil
who
as
a
singer
of
the
heavy
order
at
the
opera
carried
us
off
into
larger
things
still
the
opera
having
at
last
about
then
after
dwelling
for
years
down
town
in
shifty
tents
and
tabernacles
set
up
its
own
spacious
pavilion
and
reared
its
head
as
the
academy
of
music
all
at
the
end
or
what
served
for
the
end
of
our
very
street
where
though
it
was
exactly
near
and
union
square
bristled
between
i
could
yet
occasionally
gape
at
the
great
bills
beside
the
portal
in
which
dubreuil
always
so
serviceably
came
in
at
the
bottom
of
the
cast
a
subordinate
artist
a
grand
utility
at
the
best
i
believe
and
presently
to
become
on
that
scene
slightly
ragged
i
fear
even
in
its
freshness
permanent
or
as
we
say
nowadays
producer
he
had
yet
eminently
to
my
imagination
the
richer
the
european
value
especially
for
instance
when
our
air
thrilled
in
the
sense
that
our
attentive
parents
with
the
visit
of
the
great
grisi
and
the
great
mario
and
i
seemed
though
the
art
of
advertisement
was
then
comparatively
so
young
and
so
chaste
to
see
our
personal
acquaintance
as
he
could
almost
be
called
thickly
sandwiched
between
them
such
was
one
strange
sense
for
the
connections
of
things
that
they
drew
out
the
halls
of
ferrero
till
these
too
seemed
fairly
to
resound
with
norma
and
lucrezia
borgia
as
if
opening
straight
upon
the
stage
and
europe
by
the
stroke
had
come
to
us
in
such
force
that
we
had
but
to
enjoy
it
on
the
spot
that
could
never
have
been
more
the
case
than
on
the
occasion
of
my
assuming
for
the
famous
not
at
the
operatic
academy
but
at
the
which
came
so
nearly
to
the
same
thing
the
dress
of
a
débardeur
whatever
that
might
be
which
carried
in
its
puckered
folds
of
dark
green
relieved
with
scarlet
and
silver
such
an
exotic
fragrance
and
appealed
to
me
by
such
a
legend
the
legend
had
come
round
to
us
it
was
true
by
way
of
albany
whence
we
learned
at
the
moment
of
our
need
that
one
of
the
adventures
one
of
the
least
lamentable
of
our
cousin
johnny
had
been
his
figuring
as
a
débardeur
at
some
parisian
revel
the
elegant
evidence
of
which
neatly
packed
though
with
but
vague
instructions
for
use
was
helpfully
sent
on
to
us
the
instructions
for
use
were
in
fact
so
vague
that
i
was
afterward
to
become
a
bit
ruefully
conscious
of
having
sadly
dishonoured
or
at
least
abbreviated
my
model
i
fell
that
is
i
stood
short
of
my
proper
form
by
no
less
than
half
a
leg
the
essence
of
the
débardeur
being
it
appeared
that
he
emerged
at
the
knees
in
white
silk
stockings
and
with
neat
calves
from
the
beribboned
breeches
which
i
artlessly
suffered
to
flap
at
my
ankles
the
discovery
after
the
fact
was
disconcerting
yet
had
been
best
made
withal
too
late
for
it
would
have
seemed
i
conceive
a
less
monstrous
act
to
attempt
to
lengthen
my
legs
than
to
shorten
johnny
the
trouble
had
been
that
we
had
really
known
what
a
débardeur
and
i
am
not
sure
indeed
that
i
know
to
this
day
it
had
been
more
fatal
still
that
even
fond
albany
could
tell
us
xviii
i
have
nevertheless
the
memory
of
a
restless
relish
of
all
that
time
by
which
i
mean
of
those
final
months
of
new
york
even
with
so
scant
a
record
of
other
positive
successes
to
console
me
i
had
but
one
success
always
that
of
endlessly
supposing
wondering
admiring
i
was
sunk
in
that
luxury
which
had
never
yet
been
so
great
and
it
might
well
make
up
for
anything
it
made
up
perfectly
and
more
particularly
as
the
stopgap
as
which
i
have
already
defined
it
for
the
scantness
of
the
period
immediately
round
us
since
how
could
i
have
wanted
richer
when
the
limits
of
reality
as
i
advanced
upon
them
seemed
ever
to
recede
and
recede
it
is
true
that
but
the
other
day
on
the
scene
revisited
i
was
to
be
struck
rather
as
by
their
weird
immobility
there
on
the
north
side
still
untenanted
after
sixty
years
a
tremendous
span
in
the
life
of
new
york
was
the
vacant
lot
undiminished
in
which
a
friendly
goat
or
two
used
to
browse
whom
we
fed
perversely
with
scraps
of
paper
just
as
perversely
appreciated
indeed
through
the
relaxed
wooden
palings
there
hovers
for
me
an
impression
of
the
glass
roofs
of
a
florist
a
suffered
squatter
for
a
while
but
florists
and
goats
have
alike
disappeared
and
the
barrenness
of
the
place
is
as
sordid
as
only
untended
gaps
in
great
cities
can
seem
one
of
its
boundaries
however
still
breathes
associations
the
home
of
the
wards
the
more
eastward
of
a
pair
of
houses
then
and
still
isolated
has
remained
the
same
through
all
vicissitudes
only
now
quite
shabbily
mellow
and
like
everything
else
much
smaller
than
one
had
remembered
it
yet
this
too
without
prejudice
to
the
large
the
lustrous
part
played
in
our
prospect
by
that
interesting
family
i
saddle
their
mild
memory
a
bit
subjectively
perhaps
with
the
burden
of
that
character
making
out
that
they
were
interesting
really
in
spite
of
themselves
and
as
unwittingly
as
jourdain
expressed
himself
in
prose
owing
their
wild
savour
as
they
did
to
that
new
england
stamp
which
we
took
to
be
strong
upon
them
and
no
other
exhibition
of
which
we
had
yet
enjoyed
it
made
them
different
made
them
in
their
homely
grace
rather
aridly
romantic
i
pored
in
those
days
over
the
freshness
of
the
franconia
stories
of
the
brothers
abbott
then
immediately
sequent
to
the
sweet
rollo
series
and
even
more
admired
and
there
hung
about
the
wards
to
my
sense
that
atmosphere
of
apples
and
nuts
and
cheese
of
pies
and
and
squrruls
of
domestic
and
attendance
at
evening
lecture
of
the
fear
of
parental
discipline
and
the
cultivated
art
of
dodging
it
combined
with
great
personal
toughness
and
hardihood
an
almost
envied
liability
to
warts
on
hard
brown
hands
a
familiarity
with
garments
domestically
wrought
a
brave
rusticity
in
short
that
yet
had
prevented
the
annexation
of
whole
tracts
of
town
life
unexplored
by
ourselves
and
achieved
by
the
brothers
since
their
relatively
recent
migration
from
connecticut
which
state
in
general
with
the
city
of
hartford
in
particular
hung
as
a
hazy
fruity
rivery
background
the
very
essence
of
indian
summer
in
the
rear
of
their
discourse
three
in
number
johnny
and
charley
and
freddy
with
castigating
elders
even
to
the
second
and
third
generation
back
dimly
discerned
through
closed
they
did
at
all
haunt
the
halls
of
ferrero
it
was
a
part
of
their
homely
grace
and
their
social
tone
if
not
of
their
want
of
the
latter
that
this
could
in
the
least
be
in
question
for
them
on
the
other
hand
they
frequented
charley
and
freddy
at
least
the
free
school
which
was
round
in
thirteenth
street
johnny
the
eldest
having
entered
the
free
academy
an
institution
that
loomed
large
to
us
and
that
i
see
as
towered
or
castellated
or
otherwise
impressively
embellished
in
vague
vignettes
in
stray
representations
perhaps
only
of
the
grey
schoolbook
order
which
are
yet
associated
for
me
with
those
fond
images
of
lovely
ladies
decorating
at
either
end
the
interior
of
the
old
omnibusses
we
must
have
been
in
relation
with
no
other
feeders
at
the
public
trough
of
learning
i
ca
account
otherwise
for
the
glamour
as
of
envied
privilege
and
strange
experience
that
surrounded
the
wards
they
mixed
to
the
great
sharpening
of
the
edge
of
their
wit
in
the
wild
life
the
people
beside
which
the
life
at
mr
pulling
jenks
and
even
at
the
institution
vergnès
was
colourless
and
commonplace
somehow
they
were
of
the
people
and
still
were
full
of
family
forms
which
seemed
one
dimly
made
out
through
the
false
perspective
of
all
the
cousinships
the
stronger
and
clearer
note
of
new
england
the
note
that
had
already
determined
a
shy
yearning
under
perusal
of
the
rollo
and
franconia
chronicles
the
special
mark
of
these
friends
was
perhaps
however
that
of
being
socially
young
while
they
were
annually
old
little
freddy
in
particular
very
short
very
inured
and
very
popular
though
less
curiously
wrinkled
about
eyes
and
mouth
than
charley
confessed
to
monstrous
birthdays
even
while
crouching
or
hopping
even
while
racing
or
roaring
as
a
high
superiority
in
the
games
of
the
street
prescribed
it
was
to
strike
me
later
on
when
reading
or
hearing
of
young
americans
of
those
parts
who
had
turned
hard
or
reckless
by
reaction
from
excessive
discipline
theologic
and
economic
and
had
gone
to
sea
or
to
california
or
to
the
bad
that
freddy
and
charley
were
typical
of
the
race
even
if
their
fortunes
had
taken
as
i
hoped
a
happier
form
that
i
said
to
myself
for
the
interest
of
it
the
stuff
of
the
wards
their
homely
grace
was
all
new
england
so
far
at
least
as
new
england
emerson
and
margaret
fuller
and
channing
and
the
best
boston
families
such
in
small
very
plastic
minds
is
the
intensity
if
not
the
value
of
early
impressions
and
yet
how
can
such
visions
not
have
paled
in
the
southern
glow
of
the
norcoms
who
had
lately
arrived
from
louisville
and
had
improvised
a
fine
old
kentucky
home
in
the
last
house
of
our
row
the
one
to
be
occupied
so
differently
after
their
strange
and
precipitate
flight
as
i
dimly
make
out
by
the
ladies
of
the
sacred
heart
those
who
presently
if
i
mistake
not
moved
out
to
bloomingdale
if
they
were
not
already
in
part
established
there
next
us
westward
were
the
ogdens
three
slim
and
fair
sisters
who
soared
far
above
us
in
age
and
general
amenity
then
came
the
van
winkles
two
sisters
i
think
and
a
brother
he
much
the
most
serious
and
judicious
as
well
as
the
most
educated
of
our
friends
and
so
at
last
the
norcoms
during
their
brief
but
concentrated
most
vivid
and
momentous
reign
a
matter
as
i
recall
it
of
a
couple
of
breathless
winters
we
were
provided
by
their
presence
with
as
happy
a
foil
as
we
could
have
wished
to
the
plainness
and
dryness
of
the
wards
their
homely
grace
was
all
their
own
and
was
also
embodied
in
three
brothers
eugene
reginald
albert
whose
ages
would
have
corresponded
i
surmise
with
those
of
johnny
charley
and
freddy
if
these
latter
had
in
their
way
as
i
have
hinted
defied
any
close
notation
elder
sons
there
were
to
my
recollection
no
daughters
moved
too
as
with
their
heads
in
the
clouds
notably
stiffy
eldest
of
all
whom
we
supposed
gorgeous
who
affected
us
as
sublime
and
unapproachable
and
to
whom
we
thus
applied
the
term
in
use
among
us
before
we
had
acquired
for
reference
to
such
types
the
notion
of
the
the
dandy
the
dude
the
masher
divided
i
was
i
recall
between
the
dread
and
the
glory
of
being
so
greeted
well
stiffy
as
a
penalty
of
the
least
attempt
at
personal
adornment
the
higher
intensity
for
our
sense
of
the
norcoms
came
from
the
large
the
lavish
ease
of
their
hospitality
whereas
our
intercourse
with
the
wards
was
mainly
in
the
street
or
at
most
the
yard
and
it
was
a
wonder
how
intimacy
to
that
degree
consort
with
publicity
a
glazed
southern
gallery
known
to
its
occupants
as
the
and
to
the
rake
of
which
their
innermost
penetralia
seemed
ever
to
stand
open
encompasses
my
other
memories
everything
took
place
on
the
including
the
free
quite
the
profuse
consumption
of
hot
cakes
and
molasses
including
even
the
domestic
manufacture
of
sausages
testified
to
by
a
strange
machine
that
was
worked
like
a
handorgan
and
by
the
casual
halves
when
not
the
wholes
of
stark
stiff
hogs
fresh
from
kentucky
stores
we
must
have
been
for
a
time
constantly
engaged
with
this
delightful
group
who
never
ceased
to
welcome
us
or
to
feed
us
and
yet
of
the
presence
of
whose
members
under
other
roofs
than
their
own
by
a
return
of
hospitality
received
i
retain
no
image
they
count
and
did
grudge
the
kept
turning
and
the
molasses
flowing
for
all
who
came
that
was
the
expression
of
their
southern
grace
especially
embodied
in
albert
my
exact
contemporary
and
chosen
friend
reggie
had
but
crushed
my
fingers
under
the
hinge
of
a
closing
door
the
mark
of
which
act
of
inadvertence
i
was
to
carry
through
life
who
had
profuse
and
hair
and
the
moral
of
whose
queer
little
triangular
brown
teeth
casting
verily
a
shade
on
my
attachment
to
him
was
pointed
for
me
not
by
himself
as
the
error
of
a
kentucky
diet
the
great
kentucky
error
however
had
been
the
introduction
into
a
free
state
of
two
pieces
of
precious
property
which
our
friends
were
to
fail
to
preserve
the
pair
of
affectionate
black
retainers
whose
presence
contributed
most
to
their
exotic
note
we
revelled
in
the
fact
that
davy
and
aunt
sylvia
pronounced
a
lad
with
extraordinarily
shining
eyes
and
his
straight
grave
mother
not
radiant
as
to
anything
but
her
vivid
turban
had
been
born
and
kept
in
slavery
of
the
most
approved
pattern
and
such
as
this
intensity
of
their
condition
made
them
a
joy
a
joy
to
the
curious
mind
to
consort
with
davy
mingled
in
our
sports
and
talk
he
enriched
he
adorned
them
with
a
personal
a
pictorial
lustre
that
none
of
us
could
emulate
and
servitude
in
the
absolute
thus
did
more
for
him
socially
than
we
had
ever
seen
done
above
stairs
or
below
for
victims
of
its
lighter
forms
what
was
not
our
dismay
therefore
when
we
suddenly
learnt
it
must
have
blown
right
up
and
down
the
street
that
mother
and
son
had
fled
in
the
dead
of
night
from
bondage
had
taken
advantage
of
their
visit
to
the
north
simply
to
leave
the
house
and
not
return
covering
their
tracks
successfully
disappearing
they
had
never
been
for
us
so
beautifully
slaves
as
in
this
achievement
of
their
freedom
for
they
did
brilliantly
achieve
it
they
escaped
on
northern
soil
beyond
recall
or
recovery
i
think
we
had
already
then
on
the
spot
the
sense
of
some
degree
of
presence
at
the
making
of
history
the
question
of
what
persons
of
colour
and
of
their
condition
might
or
might
do
was
intensely
in
the
air
this
was
exactly
the
season
of
the
freshness
of
stowe
great
novel
it
must
have
come
out
at
the
moment
of
our
fondest
acquaintance
with
our
neighbours
though
i
have
no
recollection
of
hearing
them
remark
upon
it
any
remark
they
made
would
have
been
sure
to
be
so
strong
i
suspect
they
had
read
it
as
they
certainly
would
have
allowed
it
in
the
house
any
more
indeed
than
they
had
read
or
were
likely
ever
to
read
any
other
work
of
fiction
i
doubt
whether
the
house
contained
a
printed
volume
unless
its
head
had
had
in
hand
a
or
so
i
to
some
extent
recover
norcom
as
a
lawyer
who
had
come
north
on
important
difficult
business
on
contentious
precarious
grounds
a
large
bald
man
very
loose
and
ungirt
just
as
his
wife
was
a
desiccated
depressed
lady
who
mystified
me
by
always
wearing
her
nightcap
a
but
and
unmistakable
one
and
the
compass
of
whose
maternal
figure
beneath
a
large
long
collarless
cape
or
mantle
defined
imperfectly
for
me
of
course
its
connection
with
the
further
increase
of
albert
little
brothers
and
sisters
there
being
already
by
my
impression
two
or
three
of
these
in
the
background
had
davy
and
at
least
read
uncle
tom
that
question
might
well
come
up
for
us
with
the
certainty
at
any
rate
that
they
ignored
him
less
than
their
owners
were
doing
these
latter
good
people
who
had
been
so
fond
of
their
humble
dependents
and
supposed
this
affection
returned
were
shocked
at
such
ingratitude
though
i
remember
taking
a
vague
little
inward
northern
comfort
in
their
inability
in
their
discreet
decision
not
to
raise
the
hue
and
cry
was
one
even
just
dimly
aware
of
the
heavy
hush
that
in
the
glazed
gallery
among
the
sausages
and
the
had
followed
the
first
gasp
of
resentment
i
think
the
honest
norcoms
were
in
any
case
astonished
let
alone
being
much
incommoded
just
as
were
for
that
matter
when
the
genial
family
itself
installed
so
at
its
ease
failed
us
with
an
effect
of
abruptness
simply
ceased
in
their
multitude
to
be
there
i
do
remember
their
going
nor
any
pangs
of
parting
i
remember
only
knowing
with
wonderment
that
they
had
gone
that
obscurity
had
somehow
engulfed
them
and
how
afterwards
in
the
light
of
later
things
memory
and
fancy
attended
them
figured
their
history
as
the
public
complication
grew
and
the
great
intersectional
plot
thickened
felt
even
absurdly
and
disproportionately
that
they
had
helped
one
to
know
southerners
the
slim
the
sallow
the
and
eugene
in
particular
haunted
my
imagination
he
had
not
been
my
comrade
of
election
he
was
too
much
my
senior
but
i
cherished
the
thought
of
the
fine
fearless
young
he
would
have
become
and
when
the
war
had
broken
out
i
know
not
what
dark
but
pitying
vision
of
him
stretched
stark
after
a
battle
all
of
which
sounds
certainly
like
a
meagre
range
which
heaven
knows
it
was
but
with
a
plea
for
the
several
attics
already
glanced
at
and
the
positive
æsthetic
reach
that
came
to
us
through
those
dim
resorts
quite
worth
making
they
were
scattered
and
they
constituted
on
the
part
of
such
of
our
friends
as
had
license
to
lead
us
up
to
them
a
ground
of
authority
and
glory
proportioned
exactly
to
the
size
of
the
field
this
extent
was
at
cousin
helen
with
a
large
house
and
few
inmates
vast
and
free
so
that
no
hospitality
under
the
eaves
might
have
matched
that
offered
us
by
the
young
albert
if
only
that
heir
of
all
the
ages
had
had
rather
more
imagination
he
had
i
think
as
little
as
was
possible
which
would
have
counted
in
fact
for
an
unmitigated
blank
had
not
among
us
on
that
spot
and
elsewhere
supplied
this
motive
force
in
any
quantity
required
he
imagined
that
was
the
point
the
comprehensive
comedies
we
were
to
prepare
and
to
act
comprehensive
by
the
fact
that
each
one
of
us
even
to
the
but
surreptitiously
wards
was
in
fairness
to
be
enabled
to
figure
not
one
of
us
but
was
somehow
to
be
provided
with
a
part
though
i
recall
my
brother
as
the
constant
comic
star
the
attics
were
thus
in
a
word
our
respective
temples
of
the
drama
temples
in
which
the
stage
the
and
the
wardrobe
however
strike
me
as
having
consumed
most
of
our
margin
i
remember
that
is
up
and
down
the
street
and
the
association
is
mainly
with
its
far
westward
reaches
so
much
more
preparation
than
performance
so
much
more
conversation
and
costume
than
active
rehearsal
and
on
the
part
of
some
of
us
especially
doubtless
on
my
own
so
much
more
eager
denudation
both
of
body
and
mind
than
of
achieved
or
inspired
assumption
we
shivered
unclad
and
impatient
both
as
to
our
persons
and
to
our
aims
waiting
alike
for
ideas
and
for
breeches
we
were
supposed
to
make
our
dresses
no
less
than
to
create
our
characters
and
our
material
was
in
each
direction
apt
to
run
short
i
remember
how
far
ahead
of
us
my
brother
seemed
to
keep
announcing
a
motive
producing
a
figure
throwing
off
into
space
conceptions
that
i
could
stare
at
across
the
interval
but
could
appropriate
so
that
my
vision
of
him
in
these
connections
is
not
so
much
of
his
coming
toward
me
or
toward
any
of
us
as
of
his
moving
rapidly
away
in
fantastic
garb
and
with
his
back
turned
as
if
to
perform
to
some
other
and
more
assured
public
there
were
indeed
other
publics
publics
downstairs
who
glimmer
before
me
seated
at
the
open
of
ancient
parlours
but
all
from
the
point
of
view
of
an
absolute
supernumerary
more
or
less
squashed
into
the
wing
but
never
coming
on
who
were
the
copious
hunts
whose
ample
house
on
the
north
side
toward
seventh
avenue
still
stands
next
or
near
that
of
the
de
peysters
so
that
i
perhaps
confound
some
of
the
attributes
of
each
though
clear
as
to
the
blond
beekman
or
beek
of
the
latter
race
not
less
than
to
the
robust
george
and
the
stout
the
very
stout
henry
of
the
former
whom
i
see
bounding
before
a
gathered
audience
for
the
execution
of
a
clad
in
a
garment
of
turkey
red
fashioned
by
his
own
hands
and
giving
way
at
the
seams
to
a
complete
absence
of
under
the
strain
of
too
fine
a
figure
this
too
though
i
make
out
in
those
connections
that
is
in
the
twilight
of
hunt
and
de
peyster
garrets
our
command
of
a
comparative
welter
of
draperies
so
that
i
am
reduced
to
the
surmise
that
henry
indeed
had
contours
i
recover
further
some
sense
of
the
high
places
of
the
van
winkles
but
think
of
them
as
pervaded
for
us
by
the
upper
air
of
the
proprieties
the
proprieties
that
were
so
numerous
it
would
appear
when
once
one
had
had
a
glimpse
of
them
rather
than
by
the
crude
fruits
of
young
improvisation
wonderful
must
it
clearly
have
been
still
to
fed
amid
laxities
and
vaguenesses
such
a
difference
of
and
as
they
used
to
say
of
atmospheres
this
was
a
word
of
those
days
atmospheres
were
a
thing
to
recognise
and
cultivate
for
people
really
wanted
them
gasped
for
them
which
was
why
they
took
them
on
the
whole
on
easy
terms
never
exposing
them
under
an
apparent
flush
to
the
last
analysis
did
we
at
any
rate
really
vibrate
to
one
social
tone
after
another
or
are
these
adventures
for
me
now
but
fond
imaginations
no
we
vibrated
or
i
be
hanged
as
i
may
say
if
did
little
as
i
could
tell
it
or
may
have
known
it
little
as
anyone
else
may
have
known
there
were
shades
after
all
in
our
democratic
order
in
fact
as
i
brood
back
to
it
i
recognise
oppositions
the
sharpest
contrasts
the
most
intense
it
was
given
to
us
all
to
have
a
social
tone
but
the
costers
surely
had
one
and
kept
it
in
constant
use
whereas
the
wards
next
door
to
them
were
possessed
of
no
approach
to
any
and
indeed
had
the
case
been
other
had
they
had
such
a
consciousness
would
never
have
employed
it
would
have
put
it
away
on
a
high
shelf
as
they
put
the
pie
out
of
freddy
and
charley
reach
heaven
knows
what
two
would
have
done
with
it
the
van
winkles
on
the
other
hand
were
distinctly
so
provided
but
with
the
special
note
that
their
provision
was
one
so
to
express
it
with
their
educational
their
informational
call
it
even
their
professional
van
winkle
if
i
mistake
not
was
an
eminent
lawyer
and
the
note
of
our
own
house
was
the
absence
of
any
profession
to
the
quickening
of
our
general
as
distinguished
from
our
special
sensibility
there
was
no
turkey
red
among
those
particular
neighbours
at
all
events
and
if
there
had
been
it
would
have
gaped
at
the
seams
i
did
then
know
it
but
i
sipped
at
a
fount
of
culture
in
the
sense
that
is
that
our
connection
with
the
house
being
through
edgar
he
knew
about
things
inordinately
as
it
struck
me
so
for
that
matter
did
little
public
freddy
ward
but
the
things
one
of
them
knew
about
differed
wholly
from
the
objects
of
knowledge
of
the
other
all
of
which
was
splendid
for
giving
one
exactly
a
sense
of
things
it
intimated
more
and
more
how
many
such
there
would
be
altogether
and
part
of
the
interest
was
that
while
freddy
gathered
his
among
the
wild
wastes
edgar
walked
in
a
regular
maze
of
culture
i
did
then
know
about
culture
but
edgar
must
promptly
have
known
this
impression
was
promoted
by
his
moving
in
a
distant
a
higher
sphere
of
study
amid
scenes
vague
to
me
i
dimly
descry
him
as
appearing
at
jenks
and
vanishing
again
as
if
even
that
had
been
good
enough
though
i
may
be
here
at
fault
and
indeed
can
scarce
say
on
what
arduous
heights
i
supposed
him
as
a
to
dwell
i
took
the
unknown
always
easily
for
the
magnificent
and
was
sure
only
of
the
limits
of
what
i
saw
it
was
that
the
boys
swarming
for
us
at
school
were
not
often
to
my
vision
unlimited
but
that
those
peopling
our
hours
of
ease
as
i
have
already
noted
were
almost
inveterately
so
they
seemed
to
describe
always
out
of
view
so
much
larger
circles
i
linger
thus
on
edgar
by
reason
of
its
having
somehow
seemed
to
us
that
he
described
was
it
at
doctor
anthon
the
largest
of
all
if
there
was
a
bigger
place
than
doctor
anthon
it
was
there
he
would
have
been
i
break
down
as
to
the
detail
of
the
matter
in
any
push
toward
vaster
suppositions
but
let
me
cease
to
stir
this
imponderable
dust
xix
i
try
at
least
to
recover
here
however
some
closer
notation
of
w
j
aspects
yet
only
with
the
odd
effect
of
my
either
quite
losing
him
or
but
apprehending
him
again
at
seated
play
with
his
pencil
under
the
lamp
when
i
see
him
he
is
intently
though
summarily
rapidly
drawing
his
head
critically
balanced
and
his
eyebrows
working
and
when
i
see
him
it
is
because
i
have
resignedly
relinquished
him
i
ca
have
been
often
for
him
a
deprecated
still
less
an
actively
rebuffed
suitor
because
as
i
say
again
such
aggressions
were
so
little
in
order
for
me
but
i
remember
that
on
my
once
offering
him
my
company
in
conditions
those
of
some
planned
excursion
in
which
it
was
desired
his
putting
the
question
of
our
difference
at
rest
with
the
minimum
of
explanation
by
the
responsible
remark
play
with
boys
who
curse
and
swear
i
had
sadly
to
recognise
that
i
did
that
i
pretend
to
have
come
to
that
yet
and
truly
as
i
look
back
either
the
unadvisedness
and
inexpertness
of
my
young
contemporaries
on
all
that
ground
must
have
been
complete
an
interesting
note
on
our
general
manners
after
all
or
my
personal
failure
to
grasp
must
have
been
besides
which
i
wonder
scarce
less
now
than
i
wondered
then
in
just
what
company
my
brother
privilege
was
exercised
though
if
he
had
but
richly
wished
to
be
discouraging
he
quite
succeeded
it
was
that
i
might
have
been
drawn
to
the
boys
in
question
but
that
i
simply
was
qualified
all
boys
i
rather
found
were
difficult
to
play
with
unless
it
was
that
they
rather
found
but
who
would
have
been
so
difficult
as
these
they
account
but
little
moreover
i
make
out
for
w
j
eclipses
so
that
i
take
refuge
easily
enough
in
the
memory
of
my
own
pursuits
absorbing
enough
at
times
to
have
excluded
other
views
i
also
plied
the
pencil
or
to
be
more
exact
the
pen
even
if
neither
implement
critically
rapidly
or
summarily
i
was
so
often
engaged
at
that
period
it
strikes
me
in
literary
or
to
be
more
precise
in
dramatic
accompanied
by
pictorial
composition
that
i
must
again
and
again
have
delightfully
lost
myself
i
had
not
on
any
occasion
personally
succeeded
amid
our
theatric
strife
in
reaching
the
footlights
but
how
could
i
have
doubted
nevertheless
with
our
large
theatrical
experience
of
the
nature
and
of
my
understanding
of
the
dramatic
form
i
sacrificed
to
it
with
devotion
by
the
aid
of
certain
quarto
sheets
of
ruled
paper
bought
in
sixth
avenue
for
the
purpose
my
father
store
though
i
held
him
a
great
fancier
of
the
article
in
general
supplied
but
the
unruled
grateful
in
particular
for
the
happy
provision
by
which
each
fourth
page
of
the
folded
sheet
was
left
blank
when
the
drama
itself
had
covered
three
pages
the
last
one
over
which
i
most
laboured
served
for
the
illustration
of
what
i
had
verbally
presented
every
scene
had
thus
its
explanatory
picture
and
as
each
act
though
i
am
not
positively
certain
i
arrived
at
acts
would
have
had
its
vivid
climax
addicted
in
that
degree
to
fictive
evocation
i
yet
recall
on
my
part
no
practice
whatever
of
narrative
prose
or
any
sort
of
verse
i
cherished
the
scene
as
i
had
so
vibrated
to
the
idea
of
it
that
evening
at
linwood
i
thought
i
lisped
at
any
rate
i
composed
in
scenes
though
how
much
or
how
far
the
scenes
came
is
another
affair
entrances
exits
the
indication
of
business
the
animation
of
dialogue
the
multiplication
of
designated
characters
were
things
delightful
in
themselves
while
i
panted
toward
the
canvas
on
which
i
should
fling
my
figures
which
it
took
me
longer
to
fill
than
it
had
taken
me
to
write
what
went
with
it
but
which
had
on
the
other
hand
something
of
the
interest
of
the
dramatist
casting
of
his
and
must
have
helped
me
to
believe
in
the
validity
of
my
subject
from
where
on
these
occasions
that
subject
can
have
dropped
for
me
i
am
at
a
loss
to
say
and
indeed
have
a
strong
impression
that
i
did
at
any
moment
quite
know
what
i
was
writing
about
i
am
sure
i
otherwise
have
written
so
much
with
scenes
when
i
think
what
certitude
did
i
want
more
scenes
being
the
root
of
the
matter
especially
when
they
bristled
with
proper
names
and
noted
movements
especially
above
all
when
they
flowered
at
every
pretext
into
the
very
optic
and
perspective
of
the
stage
where
the
boards
diverged
correctly
from
a
central
point
of
vision
even
as
the
lashes
from
an
eyelid
straight
down
to
the
footlights
let
this
reminiscence
remind
us
of
how
rarely
in
those
days
the
real
stage
was
carpeted
the
difficulty
of
composition
was
naught
the
one
difficulty
was
in
so
placing
my
figures
on
the
fourth
page
that
these
radiations
could
be
marked
without
making
lines
through
them
the
odd
part
of
all
of
which
was
that
whereas
my
cultivation
of
the
picture
was
maintained
my
practice
of
the
play
my
addiction
to
scenes
presently
quite
dropped
i
was
capable
of
learning
though
with
inordinate
slowness
to
express
ideas
in
scenes
and
was
not
capable
with
whatever
patience
of
making
proper
pictures
yet
i
aspired
to
this
form
of
design
to
the
prejudice
of
any
other
and
long
after
those
primitive
hours
was
still
wasting
time
in
attempts
at
it
i
cared
so
much
for
nothing
else
and
that
vaguely
redressed
as
to
a
point
my
general
failure
of
acuteness
i
nursed
the
conviction
or
at
least
i
tried
to
that
if
my
clutch
of
the
pencil
or
of
the
watercolour
brush
should
once
become
intense
enough
it
would
make
up
for
other
weaknesses
of
grasp
much
as
that
would
certainly
give
it
to
do
this
was
a
very
false
scent
which
had
however
the
excuse
that
my
example
really
could
but
act
upon
me
the
scent
was
apparently
so
true
for
from
the
moment
my
small
interest
in
art
that
is
my
bent
for
gaping
at
illustrations
and
exhibitions
was
absorbing
and
genuine
there
were
elements
in
the
case
that
made
it
natural
the
picture
the
representative
design
directly
and
strongly
appealed
to
me
and
was
to
appeal
all
my
days
and
i
was
only
slow
to
recognise
the
in
this
order
that
appealed
most
my
face
was
turned
from
the
first
to
the
idea
of
representation
that
of
the
gain
of
charm
interest
mystery
dignity
distinction
gain
of
importance
in
fine
on
the
part
of
the
represented
thing
over
the
thing
of
accident
of
mere
actuality
still
unappropriated
but
in
the
house
of
representation
there
were
many
chambers
each
with
its
own
lock
and
long
was
to
be
the
business
of
sorting
and
trying
the
keys
when
i
at
last
found
deep
in
my
pocket
the
one
i
could
more
or
less
work
it
was
to
feel
with
reassurance
that
the
picture
was
still
after
all
in
essence
one
aim
so
there
had
been
in
a
manner
continuity
been
not
so
much
waste
as
one
had
sometimes
ruefully
figured
so
many
wastes
are
sweetened
for
memory
as
by
the
taste
of
the
economy
they
have
led
to
or
imposed
and
from
the
vantage
of
which
they
could
scarce
look
better
if
they
had
been
current
and
blatant
profit
was
the
very
bareness
of
the
field
itself
moreover
a
challenge
in
a
degree
to
design
not
i
mean
that
there
seemed
to
one
infant
eyes
too
few
things
to
paint
as
to
that
there
were
always
plenty
but
for
the
very
reason
that
there
were
more
than
anyone
noticed
and
that
a
hunger
was
thus
engendered
which
one
cast
about
to
gratify
the
gratification
nearest
home
was
the
imitative
the
emulative
that
is
on
my
part
i
see
needed
no
reasons
no
consciousness
other
than
that
of
being
easily
able
so
he
drew
because
he
could
while
i
did
so
in
the
main
only
because
he
did
though
i
think
we
cast
about
as
i
say
alike
making
the
most
of
every
image
within
view
i
doubt
if
he
made
more
than
i
even
then
did
though
earlier
able
to
account
for
what
he
made
afterwards
on
other
ground
and
in
richer
air
i
admit
the
challenge
was
in
the
fulness
and
not
in
the
bareness
of
aspects
with
their
natural
result
of
hunger
appeased
exhibitions
illustrations
abounded
in
paris
and
london
the
reflected
image
hung
everywhere
about
so
that
if
there
we
daubed
afresh
and
with
more
confidence
it
was
not
because
but
because
everyone
did
in
fact
when
i
call
our
appetite
appeased
i
speak
less
of
our
browsing
vision
which
was
tethered
and
insatiable
than
of
our
sense
of
the
quite
normal
character
of
our
own
proceedings
in
europe
we
knew
there
was
art
just
as
there
were
soldiers
and
lodgings
and
concierges
and
little
boys
in
the
streets
who
stared
at
us
especially
at
our
hats
and
boots
as
at
things
of
derision
just
as
to
put
it
negatively
there
were
practically
no
hot
rolls
and
no
iced
water
perhaps
too
i
should
add
we
did
enjoy
the
works
of
benjamin
haydon
then
clustered
at
the
pantheon
in
oxford
street
which
in
due
course
became
our
favourite
haunt
so
infinitely
more
after
all
than
we
had
enjoyed
those
arrayed
at
the
düsseldorf
collection
in
broadway
whence
the
huge
canvas
of
the
martyrdom
of
john
huss
comes
back
to
me
in
fact
as
a
revelation
of
representational
brightness
and
charm
that
pitched
once
for
all
in
these
matters
my
young
sense
of
what
should
be
ineffable
unsurpassable
those
hours
of
initiation
which
the
broadway
of
the
had
been
when
all
was
said
so
adequate
to
supply
if
one
wanted
pictures
there
pictures
as
large
i
seem
to
remember
as
the
side
of
a
house
and
of
a
bravery
of
colour
and
lustre
of
surface
that
i
was
never
afterwards
to
see
surpassed
we
were
shown
without
doubt
under
our
genial
law
here
too
everything
there
was
and
as
i
cast
up
the
items
i
wonder
i
confess
what
ampler
fare
we
could
have
dealt
with
the
düsseldorf
school
commanded
the
market
and
i
think
of
its
exhibition
as
firmly
seated
going
on
from
year
to
year
new
york
judging
now
to
such
another
tune
must
have
been
a
brave
patron
of
that
manufacture
i
believe
that
scandal
even
was
on
occasion
not
evaded
rather
was
boldly
invoked
though
of
what
particular
sacrifices
to
the
pure
plastic
or
undraped
shocks
to
bourgeois
prejudice
the
comfortable
german
genius
of
that
period
may
have
been
capable
history
has
kept
no
record
new
accessions
at
any
rate
vividly
new
ones
in
which
the
freshness
and
brightness
of
the
paint
particularly
lustrous
in
our
copious
light
enhanced
from
time
to
time
the
show
which
i
have
the
sense
of
our
thus
repeatedly
and
earnestly
visiting
and
which
comes
back
to
me
with
some
vagueness
as
installed
in
a
disaffected
church
where
gothic
excrescences
and
an
ecclesiastical
roof
of
a
mild
order
helped
the
importance
no
impression
here
however
was
half
so
momentous
as
that
of
the
masterpiece
of
leutze
which
showed
us
washington
crossing
the
delaware
in
a
wondrous
flare
of
projected
gaslight
and
with
the
effect
of
a
revelation
to
my
young
sight
of
the
capacity
of
accessories
to
stand
out
i
live
again
in
the
thrill
of
that
evening
which
was
the
greater
of
course
for
my
feeling
it
in
my
parents
company
when
i
should
otherwise
have
been
in
bed
we
went
down
after
dinner
in
the
fourteenth
street
stage
quite
as
if
going
to
the
theatre
the
scene
of
exhibition
was
near
the
stuyvesant
institute
a
circumstance
stirring
up
somehow
a
swarm
of
associations
echoes
probably
of
lectures
discussed
at
home
yet
at
which
my
attendance
had
doubtless
conveniently
lapsed
but
leutze
drama
left
behind
any
paler
proscenium
we
gaped
responsive
to
every
item
lost
in
the
marvel
of
the
wintry
light
of
the
sharpness
of
the
of
the
sickness
of
the
sick
soldier
of
the
protrusion
of
the
minor
objects
that
of
the
strands
of
the
rope
and
the
nails
of
the
boots
that
i
say
on
the
part
of
everything
of
its
determined
purpose
of
standing
out
but
that
above
all
of
the
profiled
national
hero
purpose
as
might
be
said
of
standing
as
much
as
possible
even
indeed
of
doing
it
almost
on
one
leg
in
such
difficulties
and
successfully
balancing
so
memorable
was
that
evening
to
remain
for
me
that
nothing
could
be
more
strange
in
connection
with
it
than
the
illustration
by
the
admired
work
on
its
in
after
years
again
coming
before
me
of
the
cold
cruelty
with
which
time
may
turn
and
devour
its
children
the
picture
more
or
less
entombed
in
its
relegation
was
lividly
dead
and
that
was
bad
enough
but
half
the
substance
of
one
youth
seemed
buried
with
it
there
were
other
pictorial
evenings
i
may
add
not
all
of
which
had
the
thrill
deep
the
disappointment
on
my
own
part
i
remember
at
bryan
gallery
of
christian
art
to
which
also
as
for
great
emotions
we
had
taken
the
omnibus
after
dinner
it
cast
a
chill
this
collection
of
diptychs
and
triptychs
of
angular
saints
and
seraphs
of
black
madonnas
and
obscure
bambinos
of
such
marked
and
approved
primitives
as
had
never
yet
been
shipped
to
our
shores
bryan
shipment
was
presently
to
fall
i
believe
under
grave
suspicion
was
to
undergo
in
fact
fatal
exposure
but
it
appealed
at
the
moment
in
apparent
good
faith
and
i
have
not
forgotten
how
conscious
that
it
was
fresh
from
europe
fresh
was
beautiful
in
the
connection
i
felt
that
my
yearning
should
all
have
gone
out
to
it
with
that
inconsequence
to
handle
i
doubt
whether
i
proclaimed
that
it
bored
me
any
more
than
i
have
ever
noted
till
now
that
it
made
me
begin
badly
with
christian
art
i
like
to
think
that
the
collection
consisted
without
abatement
of
frauds
and
fakes
and
that
if
these
had
been
honest
things
my
perception
would
so
have
slumbered
yet
the
principle
of
interest
had
been
somehow
compromised
and
i
think
i
have
never
since
stood
before
a
real
primitive
a
primitive
of
the
primitives
without
having
first
to
shake
off
the
grey
mantle
of
that
night
the
main
disconcertment
had
been
its
ugly
twist
to
the
name
of
italy
already
sweet
to
me
for
all
its
dimness
even
could
dimness
have
prevailed
in
my
felt
measure
of
the
pictorial
testimony
of
home
testimony
that
dropped
for
us
from
the
ample
canvas
of
cole
the
american
turner
which
covered
half
a
side
of
our
front
parlour
and
in
which
though
not
an
object
represented
in
it
began
to
stand
out
after
the
manner
of
leutze
i
could
always
lose
myself
as
soon
as
look
it
depicted
florence
from
one
of
the
neighbouring
hills
i
have
often
since
wondered
which
the
picture
being
long
ago
lost
to
our
sight
florence
with
her
domes
and
towers
and
old
walls
the
old
walls
cole
had
engaged
for
but
which
i
was
ruefully
to
miss
on
coming
to
know
and
love
the
place
in
after
years
then
it
was
i
felt
how
long
before
my
attachment
had
started
on
its
course
that
closer
vision
was
no
beginning
it
only
took
up
the
tale
just
as
it
comes
to
me
again
at
the
end
of
time
that
the
contemplative
monk
seated
on
a
terrace
in
the
foreground
a
constant
friend
of
my
childhood
must
have
been
of
the
convent
of
san
miniato
which
gives
me
the
site
from
which
the
painter
wrought
we
had
italy
again
in
the
corresponding
room
behind
a
great
abundance
of
italy
i
was
free
to
think
while
i
revolved
between
another
large
landscape
over
the
sofa
and
the
classic
marble
bust
on
a
pedestal
between
the
two
back
windows
the
figure
a
part
of
the
figure
of
a
lady
with
her
head
crowned
with
and
her
hair
disposed
with
a
laxity
that
was
emulated
by
the
front
of
her
dress
as
my
next
younger
brother
exposed
himself
to
my
derision
by
calling
the
bit
of
brocade
simulated
by
the
chisel
that
depending
from
a
single
so
imperfectly
covered
her
this
image
was
known
and
admired
among
us
as
the
bacchante
she
had
come
to
us
straight
from
an
american
studio
in
rome
and
i
see
my
horizon
flush
again
with
the
first
faint
dawn
of
conscious
appreciation
or
in
other
words
of
the
critical
spirit
while
two
or
three
of
the
more
restrictive
friends
of
the
house
find
our
marble
lady
very
cold
for
a
bacchante
cold
indeed
she
must
have
been
quite
as
of
the
tombstone
temperament
but
that
objection
would
drop
if
she
might
only
be
called
a
nymph
since
nymphs
were
mild
and
moderate
and
since
discussion
of
a
work
of
art
mainly
hung
in
those
days
on
that
issue
of
the
producible
i
fondly
recall
by
the
same
token
that
playing
on
a
certain
occasion
over
the
landscape
above
the
sofa
restrictive
criticism
uttered
in
my
indulged
hearing
introduced
me
to
what
had
probably
been
my
very
first
chance
on
such
ground
for
active
participation
the
picture
from
the
hand
of
a
french
painter
lefèvre
and
of
but
slightly
scanter
extent
than
the
work
of
cole
represented
in
frank
rich
colours
and
as
a
view
in
tuscany
a
rural
scene
of
some
exuberance
a
broken
and
precipitous
place
amid
mountains
and
forests
where
two
or
three
peasants
or
woodmen
were
engaged
with
much
emphasis
of
posture
in
felling
a
badly
gashed
but
spreading
oak
by
means
of
a
tense
rope
attached
to
an
upper
limb
and
at
which
they
pulled
together
tuscany
are
you
sure
it
tuscany
said
the
voice
of
restrictive
criticism
that
of
the
friend
of
the
house
who
in
the
golden
age
of
the
precursors
though
we
were
still
pretty
much
precursors
had
lived
longest
in
italy
and
then
on
my
father
challenge
of
this
demur
oh
in
tuscany
you
know
the
colours
are
much
softer
there
would
be
a
certain
haze
in
the
atmosphere
why
of
course
i
can
hear
myself
now
blushingly
but
triumphantly
intermingle
the
softness
and
the
haze
of
our
florence
there
is
florence
in
tuscany
it
had
to
be
parentally
admitted
that
florence
was
besides
which
our
friend
had
been
there
and
knew
so
that
thereafter
within
our
walls
a
certain
reigned
for
if
the
florence
was
like
it
then
the
lefèvre
could
be
and
if
the
lefèvre
was
like
it
then
the
florence
could
a
lapse
from
old
convenience
as
from
the
moment
we
could
name
the
lefèvre
where
were
we
all
of
which
it
might
have
been
open
to
me
to
feel
i
had
uncannily
promoted
xx
my
own
sense
of
the
great
matter
meanwhile
that
is
of
our
possibilities
still
more
than
of
our
actualities
of
italy
in
general
and
of
florence
in
particular
was
a
perfectly
recoverable
little
awareness
as
i
find
of
certain
mild
soft
irregular
breathings
thence
on
the
part
of
an
absent
pair
in
whom
our
parents
were
closely
interested
and
whose
communications
whose
roman
sorrentine
florentine
letters
letters
in
especial
from
the
baths
of
lucca
kept
open
in
our
air
more
than
any
other
sweet
irritation
that
question
of
europe
which
was
to
have
after
all
in
the
immediate
years
so
limited
so
shortened
a
solution
mary
temple
the
elder
had
early
in
our
fourteenth
street
period
married
edmund
tweedy
a
haunter
of
that
neighbourhood
and
of
our
house
in
it
from
the
first
but
never
more
than
during
a
winter
spent
with
us
there
by
that
who
by
an
extension
of
interest
and
admiration
she
was
in
those
years
quite
exceedingly
handsome
ranked
for
us
with
the
albany
aunts
adding
so
a
twist
as
it
were
to
our
tie
with
the
temple
cousins
her
own
close
kin
this
couple
must
have
been
putting
real
relatives
aside
my
parents
best
friends
in
europe
twitching
thereby
hardest
the
fine
firm
thread
attached
at
one
end
to
our
general
desire
and
at
the
other
to
their
supposed
felicity
the
real
relatives
those
planted
out
in
the
same
countries
are
a
chapter
by
themselves
whose
effect
on
us
whose
place
in
our
vision
i
should
like
to
trace
that
of
the
kings
for
instance
of
my
mother
kin
that
of
the
masons
of
my
father
the
kings
who
cultivated
for
years
the
highest
instructional
social
and
moral
possibilities
at
geneva
the
masons
above
all
less
strenuous
but
more
sympathetic
who
reported
themselves
to
us
hauntingly
during
a
considerable
period
as
enjoying
every
conceivable
at
tours
and
at
the
then
undeveloped
trouville
even
the
winter
trouville
on
the
lowest
possible
terms
fain
would
i
as
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
it
under
the
temptation
to
delineate
gather
into
my
loose
net
the
singularly
sharp
and
rounded
image
of
our
cousin
charlotte
of
the
former
name
who
figured
for
us
on
the
field
of
europe
wherever
we
looked
and
all
the
rest
of
time
as
a
character
of
characters
and
a
marvel
of
placid
consistency
through
my
vague
remembrance
of
her
return
from
china
after
the
arrest
of
a
commercial
career
there
by
her
death
in
the
red
sea
which
somehow
sounded
like
a
dreadful
form
of
death
and
my
scarce
less
faint
recovery
of
some
christmas
treat
of
our
childhood
under
her
roof
in
gramercy
park
amid
dim
chinoiseries
and
in
that
twilight
of
time
dimmer
offspring
vernon
anne
arthur
marked
to
us
always
in
the
distincter
years
as
of
all
our
young
relatives
the
most
intensely
educated
and
most
pointedly
proper
an
occasion
followed
by
her
permanent
and
invidious
withdrawal
from
her
own
country
i
would
keep
her
in
my
eye
through
the
genevese
age
and
on
to
the
crisis
of
the
civil
war
in
which
vernon
unforgiven
by
her
stiff
conservatism
for
his
northern
loyalty
laid
down
before
petersburg
a
young
life
of
understanding
and
pain
uncommemorated
as
to
the
gallantry
of
its
end
he
had
insistently
returned
to
the
front
after
a
recovery
from
first
wounds
as
under
his
mother
malediction
on
the
stone
beneath
which
he
lies
in
the
old
burial
ground
at
newport
the
cradle
of
his
father
family
i
should
further
pursue
my
subject
through
other
periods
and
places
other
constantly
quiet
but
vivid
exhibitions
to
the
very
end
of
the
story
which
for
myself
was
the
impression
first
of
a
little
lonely
gentle
relentless
lady
in
a
dull
surrey
garden
of
a
summer
afternoon
more
than
half
blind
and
all
dependent
on
the
de
who
read
aloud
to
her
that
saturday
review
which
had
ever
been
the
prop
and
mirror
of
her
opinions
and
to
which
she
remained
faithful
her
children
estranged
and
outworn
dead
and
ignored
and
the
vision
second
and
for
a
climax
of
an
at
versailles
goal
of
my
final
pilgrimage
almost
in
presence
of
the
end
end
of
her
very
personal
career
i
mean
but
not
of
her
perfectly
firm
spirit
or
of
her
charmingly
smooth
address
i
confess
myself
embarrassed
by
my
very
ease
of
of
my
young
consciousness
so
that
i
perforce
try
to
encourage
lapses
and
keep
my
abundance
down
the
place
for
the
lapse
consents
with
difficulty
however
to
be
particular
point
of
the
past
at
which
i
catch
myself
easily
caught
as
i
am
looking
about
me
it
has
certainly
nothing
in
common
with
that
coign
of
vantage
enjoyed
by
me
one
june
afternoon
of
in
the
form
of
the
minor
share
of
the
box
of
a
carriage
that
conveyed
us
for
the
first
time
since
our
babyhood
w
j
and
mine
through
so
much
of
a
vast
portentous
london
i
was
an
item
in
the
overflow
of
a
vehicle
completely
occupied
and
i
thrilled
with
the
spectacle
my
seat
beside
the
coachman
so
amply
commanded
without
knowing
at
this
moment
why
amid
other
claims
i
had
been
marked
for
such
an
eminence
i
so
far
justify
my
privilege
at
least
as
still
to
feel
that
prime
impression
of
extreme
intensity
underlie
deep
down
the
whole
mass
of
later
observation
there
are
london
aspects
which
so
far
as
they
still
touch
me
after
all
the
years
touch
me
as
just
sensible
reminders
of
this
hour
of
early
apprehension
so
penetrated
for
me
as
to
have
kept
its
ineffaceable
stamp
for
at
last
we
had
come
to
europe
we
had
disembarked
at
liverpool
but
a
couple
of
days
before
from
that
steamer
atlantic
of
the
collins
line
then
active
but
so
soon
to
be
utterly
undone
of
which
i
had
kept
a
romantic
note
ever
since
a
certain
evening
of
a
winter
or
two
before
i
had
on
that
occasion
assisted
with
my
parents
at
a
varied
theatrical
exhibition
the
theatre
is
distinct
to
me
as
brougham
one
of
the
features
of
which
was
the
at
that
time
flourishing
farce
of
betsy
baker
a
picture
of
some
predicament
supposed
droll
of
its
hero
mouser
whose
wife
if
i
am
correct
carries
on
a
laundry
and
controls
as
she
may
a
train
of
young
assistants
a
feature
of
the
piece
comes
back
to
me
as
the
pursuit
of
mouser
round
and
round
the
premises
by
the
troop
of
laundresses
shouting
his
name
in
chorus
capture
by
them
being
abject
though
whether
through
fear
of
their
endearments
or
of
their
harsher
violence
i
fail
to
remember
it
was
enough
that
the
public
nerve
had
at
the
moment
been
tried
by
the
of
the
atlantic
several
days
overdue
to
the
pitch
at
last
of
extreme
anxiety
so
that
when
after
the
fall
of
the
curtain
on
the
farce
the
distracted
mouser
still
breathless
reappeared
at
the
footlights
where
i
can
see
him
now
abate
by
his
plight
no
jot
of
the
dignity
of
his
announcement
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
rejoice
to
be
able
to
tell
you
that
the
good
ship
atlantic
is
safe
the
house
broke
into
such
plaudits
so
huge
and
prolonged
a
roar
of
relief
as
i
had
never
heard
the
like
of
and
which
gave
me
my
first
measure
of
a
great
immediate
public
emotion
even
as
the
incident
itself
reminds
me
of
the
smallness
of
the
old
new
york
those
happy
limits
that
could
make
us
all
care
and
care
to
fond
vociferation
for
the
same
thing
at
once
it
was
a
moment
of
the
golden
age
representing
too
but
a
snatch
of
elation
since
the
wretched
arctic
had
gone
down
in
mortal
woe
and
her
other
companion
the
pacific
leaving
england
a
few
months
later
and
under
the
interested
eyes
of
our
family
group
then
temporarily
settled
in
london
was
never
heard
of
more
let
all
of
which
show
again
what
traps
are
laid
about
me
for
unguarded
acute
reminiscence
i
meet
another
of
these
though
i
positively
try
to
avoid
it
in
the
sense
of
a
day
spent
on
the
great
fusty
curtained
bed
a
mediæval
such
as
i
had
never
seen
of
the
hotel
at
the
london
and
station
where
it
appeared
to
our
great
inconvenience
that
i
had
during
the
previous
months
somewhere
perversely
absorbed
probably
on
staten
island
upwards
of
a
year
before
the
dull
seed
of
malaria
which
now
suddenly
broke
out
in
chills
and
fever
this
condition
of
the
intermittent
order
hampered
our
movements
but
left
alternate
days
on
which
we
could
travel
and
as
present
to
me
as
ever
is
the
apprehended
interest
of
my
important
and
determinant
state
and
of
our
complicated
prospect
while
i
lay
much
at
my
ease
for
i
recall
in
particular
certain
short
sweet
times
when
i
could
be
left
alone
with
the
thick
and
heavy
suggestions
of
the
london
room
about
me
the
very
smell
of
which
was
ancient
strange
and
impressive
a
new
revelation
altogether
and
the
window
open
to
the
english
june
and
the
far
off
hum
of
a
thousand
possibilities
i
consciously
took
them
in
these
last
and
must
then
i
think
have
first
tasted
the
very
greatest
pleasure
perhaps
i
was
ever
to
know
that
of
almost
holding
my
breath
in
presence
of
certain
aspects
to
the
end
of
so
taking
in
it
was
as
if
in
those
hours
that
precious
fine
art
had
been
disclosed
to
me
scantly
as
the
poor
place
and
the
small
occasion
might
have
seemed
of
an
order
to
promote
it
we
seize
our
property
by
an
avid
instinct
wherever
we
find
it
and
i
must
have
kept
seizing
mine
at
the
absurdest
little
rate
and
all
by
this
deeply
dissimulative
process
of
taking
in
through
the
whole
succession
of
those
summer
days
the
next
application
of
it
that
stands
out
for
me
or
the
next
that
i
make
room
for
here
since
i
note
after
all
so
much
less
than
i
remember
is
the
intensity
of
a
fond
apprehension
of
paris
a
few
days
later
from
the
balcony
of
an
hotel
that
hung
through
the
soft
summer
night
over
the
rue
de
la
paix
i
hung
with
the
balcony
and
doubtless
with
my
brothers
and
my
sister
though
i
recover
what
i
felt
as
so
much
relation
and
response
to
the
larger
the
largest
appeal
only
that
of
the
whole
perfect
parisianism
i
seemed
to
myself
always
to
have
possessed
mentally
even
if
i
had
but
just
turned
twelve
and
that
now
filled
out
its
frame
or
case
for
me
from
every
lighted
window
up
and
down
as
if
each
of
these
had
been
for
strength
of
sense
a
word
in
some
immortal
quotation
the
very
breath
of
civilised
lips
how
i
had
anciently
gathered
such
stores
of
preconception
is
more
than
i
shall
undertake
an
account
of
though
i
believe
i
should
be
able
to
scrape
one
together
certain
it
is
at
any
rate
that
half
the
beauty
of
the
whole
exposed
second
floor
of
a
just
opposite
for
instance
with
the
fittings
and
figurings
as
well
as
the
intent
immobilities
of
busy
young
women
descried
through
frank
and
as
it
were
benignant
apertures
and
of
such
bright
fine
strain
that
they
but
asked
to
work
far
into
the
night
came
from
the
effect
on
the
part
of
these
things
of
so
exactly
crowning
and
comforting
i
could
have
said
what
momentous
young
dream
i
might
have
been
to
myself
as
against
some
danger
of
being
wrong
and
if
i
had
uttered
my
main
comment
on
it
all
this
must
certainly
have
been
i
told
you
so
i
told
you
so
what
i
had
told
myself
was
of
course
that
the
impression
would
be
of
the
richest
and
at
the
same
time
of
the
most
insinuating
and
this
after
all
did
sail
very
close
but
i
had
had
before
me
from
far
back
a
picture
which
might
have
been
hung
in
the
very
sky
and
here
was
every
touch
in
it
repeated
with
a
charm
had
i
ever
till
then
known
what
a
charm
a
large
a
local
a
social
charm
leaving
out
that
of
a
few
individuals
it
was
at
all
events
this
mystery
one
property
that
of
one
mind
and
so
once
for
all
i
helped
myself
to
it
from
my
balcony
and
tucked
it
away
it
counted
all
immensely
for
practice
in
taking
in
i
profited
by
that
no
doubt
still
a
few
days
later
at
an
hour
that
has
never
ceased
to
recur
to
me
all
my
life
as
crucial
as
supremely
determinant
the
had
stopped
at
a
village
on
the
way
from
lyons
to
geneva
between
which
places
there
was
then
no
railway
a
village
now
nameless
to
me
and
which
was
not
yet
nantua
in
the
jura
where
we
were
to
spend
the
night
i
was
stretched
at
my
ease
on
a
couch
formed
by
a
plank
laid
from
seat
to
seat
and
covered
by
a
small
mattress
and
other
draperies
an
indulgence
founded
on
my
visitation
of
fever
which
though
not
now
checking
our
progress
assured
me
in
our
little
band
these
invidious
luxuries
it
may
have
been
that
as
my
body
was
pampered
so
i
was
moved
equally
to
pamper
my
spirit
for
my
appropriative
instinct
had
neglected
no
item
of
our
case
from
the
first
by
which
i
mean
from
the
moment
of
our
getting
under
way
that
morning
with
much
elaboration
in
the
court
of
the
old
hôtel
de
at
lyons
where
we
had
arrived
two
days
before
and
awaited
my
good
pleasure
during
hours
that
overflowed
for
us
perhaps
somewhat
less
than
any
pair
of
days
yet
but
as
regards
which
it
was
afterwards
my
complacent
theory
that
my
contemplative
rest
at
the
ancient
inn
with
all
the
voices
and
graces
of
the
past
of
the
court
of
the
french
scheme
of
manners
in
general
and
of
ancient
inns
as
such
in
particular
had
prepared
me
not
a
little
when
i
should
in
due
course
hear
of
it
for
what
was
meant
by
the
de
that
expression
which
was
to
become
later
on
so
as
old
fine
colour
and
old
fine
opinion
are
toned
it
was
the
romance
of
travel
and
it
was
the
romance
flushed
with
suppositions
and
echoes
with
implications
and
memories
memories
of
one
reading
save
the
mark
all
the
more
that
our
proper
bestowal
required
two
carriages
in
which
we
were
to
post
ineffable
thought
and
which
bristled
with
every
kind
of
contradiction
of
common
experience
the
postilion
in
a
costume
rather
recalling
from
the
halls
of
ferrero
that
of
my
débardeur
bobbed
up
and
down
the
italian
courier
jean
nadali
and
acquired
in
london
sat
in
the
rumble
along
with
annette
godefroi
of
metz
and
a
bonne
lorraine
if
ever
there
was
acquired
in
new
york
i
enjoy
the
echo
of
their
very
names
neither
unprecedented
nor
irreproducible
yet
which
melt
together
for
me
to
intensification
with
all
the
rest
with
the
recovered
moment
above
all
of
our
pause
at
the
in
the
cool
sunshine
we
had
mounted
and
mounted
during
which
in
my
absurdly
cushioned
state
i
took
in
as
i
have
hinted
by
a
long
slow
swig
that
testified
to
some
power
of
elbow
a
larger
draught
of
the
wine
of
perception
than
any
i
had
ever
before
owed
to
a
single
throb
of
that
faculty
the
village
street
which
was
not
as
village
streets
hitherto
known
to
me
opened
out
beyond
an
interval
into
a
high
place
on
which
perched
an
object
also
a
fresh
revelation
and
that
i
recognised
with
a
deep
joy
though
a
joy
that
was
doubtless
partly
the
sense
of
fantastic
ease
of
abated
illness
and
of
cold
chicken
as
at
once
a
castle
and
a
ruin
the
only
castle
within
my
ken
had
been
by
my
impression
the
machicolated
villa
above
us
the
previous
summer
at
new
brighton
and
as
i
had
seen
no
structure
rise
beyond
that
majesty
so
i
had
seen
none
abased
to
the
dignity
of
ruin
loose
boards
were
no
expression
of
this
latter
phase
and
i
was
already
somehow
aware
of
a
deeper
note
in
the
crumbled
castle
than
any
note
of
the
solid
one
little
experience
as
i
had
had
either
of
solidity
at
a
point
in
the
interval
at
any
rate
below
the
slope
on
which
this
memento
stood
was
a
woman
in
a
black
bodice
a
white
shirt
and
a
red
petticoat
engaged
in
some
sort
of
field
labour
the
effect
of
whose
intervention
just
then
is
almost
beyond
my
notation
i
knew
her
for
a
peasant
in
sabots
the
first
peasant
i
had
ever
beheld
or
beheld
at
least
to
such
advantage
she
had
in
the
whole
aspect
an
enormous
value
emphasising
with
her
petticoat
tonic
strength
the
truth
that
sank
in
as
i
lay
the
truth
of
one
embracing
there
in
all
the
presented
character
of
the
scene
an
amount
of
character
i
had
felt
no
scene
present
not
even
the
one
i
had
raked
from
the
hôtel
westminster
the
sort
of
thing
that
even
as
mere
fulness
and
mere
weight
would
sit
most
warmly
in
the
mind
supremely
in
that
ecstatic
vision
was
europe
sublime
synthesis
expressed
and
guaranteed
to
me
as
if
by
a
mystic
gage
which
spread
all
through
the
summer
air
that
i
should
now
only
now
never
lose
it
hold
the
whole
consistency
of
it
up
to
that
time
it
might
have
been
but
mockingly
whisked
before
me
europe
have
been
flattered
it
was
true
at
my
finding
her
thus
most
signified
and
summarised
in
a
sordid
old
woman
scraping
a
mean
living
and
an
uninhabitable
tower
abandoned
to
the
owls
that
was
but
the
momentary
measure
of
a
small
sick
boy
however
and
the
virtue
of
the
impression
was
proportioned
to
my
capacity
it
made
a
bridge
over
to
more
things
than
i
then
knew
xxi
how
shall
i
render
certain
other
impressions
coming
back
to
me
from
that
summer
which
were
doubtless
involved
in
my
having
still
for
a
time
on
the
alternate
days
when
my
complaint
was
active
to
lie
up
on
various
couches
and
for
my
main
comfort
consider
the
situation
i
considered
it
best
i
think
gathering
in
the
fruits
of
a
quickened
sensibility
to
it
in
certain
umbrageous
apartments
in
which
my
parents
had
settled
themselves
near
geneva
an
old
house
in
ample
grounds
and
among
great
spreading
trees
that
pleasantly
brushed
our
windows
in
the
summer
heats
and
airs
known
if
i
am
not
mistaken
as
the
campagne
gerebsoff
which
its
mistress
an
invalid
russian
lady
had
partly
placed
at
our
disposition
while
she
reclined
in
her
own
quarter
of
the
garden
on
a
chaise
longue
and
under
a
mushroom
hat
with
a
green
veil
and
i
in
the
course
of
the
mild
excursions
appointed
as
my
limit
considered
her
from
afar
in
the
light
of
the
legends
supplied
to
me
as
to
her
identity
history
general
practices
and
proceedings
by
my
younger
brother
wilky
who
according
to
his
nature
or
i
may
say
to
his
genius
had
made
without
loss
of
time
great
advances
of
acquaintance
with
her
and
quickened
thereby
my
sense
of
his
superior
talent
for
life
wilky
age
followed
closely
on
mine
and
from
that
time
on
we
conversed
and
consorted
though
with
lapses
and
disparities
i
being
on
the
whole
during
the
succession
of
those
years
in
the
grateful
the
really
fortunate
position
of
having
one
exposure
rather
the
northward
as
it
were
to
the
view
of
and
the
other
perhaps
the
more
immediately
sunned
surface
to
the
genial
glow
of
my
junior
of
this
i
shall
have
more
to
say
but
to
meet
in
memory
meanwhile
even
this
early
flicker
of
him
is
to
know
again
something
of
the
sense
that
i
attached
all
along
our
boyhood
to
his
successful
sociability
his
instinct
for
intercourse
his
genius
as
i
have
used
the
word
for
making
friends
it
was
the
only
genius
he
had
declaring
itself
from
his
tenderest
years
never
knowing
the
shadow
of
defeat
and
giving
me
above
all
from
as
far
back
and
by
the
very
radiation
of
the
fact
endlessly
much
to
think
of
for
i
had
in
a
manner
thanks
to
the
radiation
much
of
the
benefit
his
geniality
was
absolutely
such
that
the
friends
he
made
were
made
almost
less
for
himself
so
to
speak
than
for
other
friends
of
whom
indeed
we
his
own
adjuncts
were
easily
first
so
far
at
least
as
he
discriminated
at
night
all
cats
are
grey
and
in
this
brother
easy
view
all
his
acquaintance
were
his
family
the
trail
of
his
sociability
was
over
us
all
alike
though
it
here
concerns
me
but
to
the
effect
as
i
recover
it
of
its
weight
on
my
comparatively
so
indirect
faculty
for
what
is
called
taking
life
i
must
have
already
at
the
campagne
gerebsoff
begun
to
see
him
take
it
with
all
his
directness
begun
in
fact
to
be
a
trifle
tormentedly
aware
that
though
there
might
be
many
ways
of
so
doing
we
are
condemned
practically
to
a
choice
not
made
free
of
them
all
reduced
to
the
use
of
but
one
at
the
best
which
it
is
to
our
interest
to
make
the
most
of
since
we
may
indeed
sometimes
make
much
there
was
a
small
sad
charm
i
should
doubtless
add
in
this
operation
of
the
contrast
of
the
case
before
me
with
my
own
case
it
was
positively
as
if
wilky
were
supplying
me
on
occasion
with
the
most
immediate
matter
for
my
own
that
was
particularly
marked
after
he
had
with
our
elder
brother
been
placed
at
school
the
pensionnat
roediger
at
châtelaine
then
much
esteemed
and
where
i
was
supposedly
to
join
them
on
my
complete
recovery
i
recall
sociable
irrepressibly
sociable
thence
on
the
part
of
the
pair
as
promptly
breaking
out
not
less
than
i
recall
sociable
afternoon
visits
to
the
establishment
on
the
part
of
the
rest
of
us
it
was
my
brothers
first
boarding
school
but
as
we
had
in
the
new
york
conditions
kept
punctually
rejoining
our
family
so
in
these
pleasant
genevese
ones
our
family
returned
the
attention
of
this
also
more
anon
my
particular
point
is
just
the
wealth
of
contribution
to
my
rich
current
consciousness
the
consciousness
fairly
rich
by
my
taking
in
as
aforesaid
at
reflective
hours
hours
when
i
was
in
a
manner
alone
with
it
our
roomy
and
shadowy
our
almost
haunted
interior
admirable
the
scale
and
solidity
in
general
of
the
ancient
villas
planted
about
geneva
and
our
house
affected
me
as
so
massive
and
so
spacious
that
even
our
own
half
of
it
seemed
vast
i
had
never
before
lived
so
long
in
anything
so
old
and
as
i
somehow
felt
so
deep
depth
depth
upon
depth
was
what
came
out
for
me
at
certain
times
of
my
waiting
above
in
my
immense
room
of
thick
embrasures
and
rather
prompt
obscurity
while
the
summer
afternoon
waned
and
my
companions
often
below
at
dinner
lingered
and
left
me
just
perhaps
a
bit
overwhelmed
that
was
the
sense
of
it
the
in
the
whole
place
pressed
upon
me
with
a
force
i
had
met
and
that
was
beyond
my
analysis
which
is
but
another
way
of
saying
how
directly
notified
i
felt
that
such
material
conditions
as
i
known
could
have
had
no
depth
at
all
my
depth
was
a
vague
measure
no
doubt
but
it
made
space
in
the
twilight
for
an
occasional
small
sound
of
voice
or
step
from
the
garden
or
the
rooms
of
which
the
great
homely
the
opaque
green
shutters
opened
there
softly
to
echo
in
mixed
with
reverberations
finer
and
more
momentous
personal
experimental
if
they
might
be
called
so
which
i
much
encouraged
they
borrowed
such
tone
from
our
new
surrounding
medium
and
half
of
which
were
reducible
to
wilky
personalities
and
experience
these
latter
irrepressibly
communicated
being
ever
enviably
though
a
trifle
bewilderingly
and
even
formidably
personalities
there
was
the
difference
and
the
opposition
as
i
really
believe
i
was
already
aware
that
one
way
of
taking
life
was
to
go
in
for
everything
and
everyone
which
kept
you
abundantly
occupied
and
the
other
way
was
to
be
as
occupied
quite
as
occupied
just
with
the
sense
and
the
image
of
it
all
and
on
only
a
fifth
of
the
actual
immersion
a
circumstance
extremely
strange
life
was
taken
almost
equally
both
ways
that
i
mean
seemed
the
strangeness
mere
brute
quantity
and
number
being
so
much
less
in
one
case
than
the
other
these
latter
were
what
i
should
have
to
go
in
for
had
i
but
had
the
intrinsic
faculties
that
more
than
ever
came
home
to
me
on
those
occasions
when
as
i
could
move
further
and
stay
out
longer
i
accompanied
my
parents
on
afternoon
visits
to
châtelaine
and
the
campagne
roediger
a
scene
that
has
remained
with
me
as
nobly
placid
and
pastoral
the
great
trees
stood
about
casting
afternoon
shadows
the
old
villa
and
its
dépendances
had
the
air
of
the
happiest
home
the
big
bearded
bonhomie
of
roediger
among
his
little
polyglot
charges
no
petits
pays
chauds
these
appeared
to
justify
and
more
the
fond
new
york
theory
of
swiss
education
the
kind
la
of
young
new
yorkers
as
a
beautifully
genialised
humanised
civilised
even
romanticised
thing
in
which
amid
lawny
mountain
slopes
the
languages
flowed
into
so
many
beaming
recipients
on
a
stream
of
milk
and
honey
and
the
relation
above
all
the
relation
from
master
to
pupil
and
back
again
was
of
an
amenity
that
would
have
been
of
this
world
save
for
the
providential
arrangement
of
a
perfect
pedagogic
switzerland
did
you
notice
the
relation
how
charming
it
was
our
parents
were
apt
to
say
to
each
other
after
these
visits
in
reference
to
some
observed
show
of
confidence
between
instructor
and
instructed
while
as
for
myself
i
was
lost
in
the
wonder
of
the
relations
my
younger
brother
seemed
to
live
and
to
his
own
ingenuous
relish
as
well
in
such
a
happy
hum
of
them
the
languages
had
reason
to
prosper
they
were
so
copiously
represented
the
english
jostled
the
american
the
russian
the
german
and
there
even
trickled
through
a
little
funny
french
a
great
geneva
school
of
those
days
was
the
institution
haccius
to
which
generations
of
our
young
countrymen
had
been
dedicated
and
our
own
faces
first
turned
under
correction
however
by
the
perceived
truth
that
if
the
languages
were
in
question
the
american
reigned
there
almost
unchallenged
the
establishment
chosen
for
our
experiment
must
have
appealed
by
some
intimate
and
insinuating
side
and
as
less
patronised
by
the
rich
and
the
sophisticated
for
even
in
those
days
some
americans
were
rich
and
several
sophisticated
little
indeed
as
it
was
all
to
matter
in
the
event
so
short
a
course
had
the
experiment
just
then
to
run
what
it
mainly
brings
back
to
me
is
the
fine
old
candour
and
queerness
of
the
new
york
state
of
mind
begotten
really
not
a
little
i
think
under
our
own
roof
by
the
mere
charmed
perusal
of
rodolphe
toeppfer
voyages
en
zigzag
the
two
goodly
octavo
volumes
of
which
delightful
work
an
adorable
book
taken
with
its
illustrations
had
come
out
early
in
the
and
had
engaged
our
fondest
study
it
is
the
copious
chronicle
by
a
schoolmaster
endless
humour
and
sympathy
of
what
degree
and
form
of
authority
it
never
occurred
to
one
even
to
ask
of
his
holiday
excursions
with
his
pupils
mainly
on
foot
and
with
staff
and
knapsack
through
the
incomparable
switzerland
of
the
time
before
the
railways
and
the
rush
before
the
monster
hotels
the
desecrated
summits
the
vulgarised
valleys
the
circular
tours
the
perforating
tubes
the
funiculars
the
hordes
the
horrors
to
turn
back
to
toeppfer
pages
is
to
get
the
sense
of
a
lost
paradise
and
the
effect
for
me
even
yet
of
having
pored
over
them
in
my
childhood
is
to
steep
in
sweetness
and
quaintness
some
of
the
pictures
his
own
illustrations
are
of
the
pleasantest
and
drollest
and
the
association
makes
that
faded
swiss
master
of
landscape
calame
of
the
calamités
a
quite
sufficient
ruysdael
it
must
have
been
conceived
for
us
that
we
would
lead
in
these
conditions
always
in
pursuit
of
an
education
a
life
not
too
dissimilar
to
that
of
the
storied
exiles
in
the
forest
of
arden
though
one
would
fain
not
press
after
all
upon
ideals
of
culture
so
little
organised
so
little
conscious
up
to
that
moment
of
our
ferocities
of
comparison
and
competition
of
imposed
preparation
this
particular
loose
ideal
reached
out
from
the
desert
or
what
might
under
discouragement
pass
for
such
it
invoked
the
light
but
a
simplicity
of
view
which
was
somehow
one
with
the
beauty
of
other
convictions
accompanied
its
effort
and
though
a
glance
at
the
social
psychology
of
some
of
its
cheerful
estimates
its
relative
importances
assumed
and
acted
upon
might
here
seem
indicated
there
are
depths
of
the
ancient
serenity
that
nothing
would
induce
me
to
sound
i
need
linger
the
less
moreover
since
we
in
fact
oddly
enough
lingered
so
little
so
very
little
for
reasons
doubtless
well
known
to
ourselves
at
the
time
but
which
i
at
present
fail
to
recapture
that
what
next
stands
vividly
out
for
me
is
our
renewed
passage
through
paris
on
the
way
to
london
for
the
winter
a
turn
of
our
situation
invested
at
the
time
with
nothing
whatever
of
the
wonderful
yet
which
would
again
half
prompt
me
to
soundings
were
i
not
to
recognise
in
it
that
mark
of
the
fitful
that
accent
of
the
improvised
that
general
quality
of
earnest
and
reasoned
yet
at
the
same
time
almost
passionate
impatience
which
was
to
devote
us
for
some
time
to
variety
almost
to
incoherency
of
interest
we
had
fared
across
the
sea
under
the
glamour
of
the
swiss
school
in
the
abstract
but
the
swiss
school
in
the
concrete
soon
turned
stale
on
our
hands
a
fact
over
which
i
remember
myself
as
no
further
critical
than
to
feel
not
without
zest
that
since
one
was
all
eyes
and
the
world
decidedly
at
such
a
pace
all
images
it
ministered
to
the
panoramic
it
ministered
to
begin
with
through
our
very
early
start
for
lyons
again
in
the
october
dawn
without
nadali
or
the
carriages
this
time
but
on
the
basis
of
the
vast
yellow
and
rumbling
which
we
availed
wholly
to
fill
and
of
which
the
high
haughtiness
was
such
that
it
could
stop
even
for
an
instant
only
at
appointed
and
much
dissevered
places
to
the
effect
i
recall
of
its
vainly
attempted
arrest
by
our
cousin
charlotte
king
beforementioned
whom
i
see
now
suddenly
emerge
fresh
confident
and
pretty
from
some
rural
retreat
by
the
road
a
scene
of
simple
villeggiatura
rien
que
pour
saluer
ces
dames
as
she
pleaded
to
the
conductor
whom
she
practically
if
not
permittedly
overmastered
leaving
with
me
still
the
wonder
of
her
happy
fusion
of
opposites
the
coach
had
not
in
the
event
paused
but
so
neither
had
she
and
as
it
ignored
flush
and
flurry
quite
as
it
defied
delay
she
was
equally
a
match
for
it
in
these
particulars
blandly
achieving
her
visit
to
us
while
it
rumbled
on
making
a
perfect
success
and
a
perfect
grace
of
her
idea
she
dropped
as
elegantly
out
as
she
had
gymnastically
floated
in
and
ces
dames
must
much
have
wished
they
could
emulate
her
art
save
for
this
my
view
of
that
migration
has
faded
though
to
shine
out
again
to
the
sense
of
our
early
morning
arrival
in
paris
a
couple
of
days
later
and
our
hunt
there
vain
at
first
for
an
hotel
that
would
put
us
numerously
up
vain
till
we
had
sat
awhile
in
the
rue
du
helder
i
think
before
that
of
an
albany
uncle
luckily
on
the
scene
and
finally
invoked
who
after
some
delay
descended
to
us
with
a
very
foreign
air
i
fancied
and
no
possibility
to
his
regret
of
placing
us
under
his
own
roof
as
if
indeed
i
remember
reflecting
we
could
such
as
we
were
have
been
desired
to
share
his
foreign
interests
such
as
were
he
espoused
our
cause
however
with
gay
goodnature
while
i
wondered
in
my
admiration
for
him
and
curiosity
about
him
how
he
really
liked
us
and
a
bit
doubtfully
whether
i
should
have
liked
us
had
i
been
in
his
place
and
after
some
further
adventure
installed
us
at
the
hôtel
de
la
ville
de
paris
in
the
rue
de
la
a
resort
now
long
since
extinct
though
it
lingered
on
for
some
years
and
which
i
think
of
as
rather
huddled
and
disappointingly
private
to
the
abatement
of
spectacle
and
standing
obliquely
beyond
a
wall
a
high
gateway
and
a
more
or
less
cobbled
court
xxii
little
else
of
that
parisian
passage
remains
with
me
it
was
probably
of
the
briefest
i
recover
only
a
visit
with
my
father
to
the
palais
de
where
the
first
of
the
great
french
exhibitions
on
the
model
much
reduced
of
the
english
crystal
palace
of
was
still
open
a
fact
explaining
the
crowded
inns
and
from
that
visit
win
back
but
the
department
of
the
english
pictures
and
our
stopping
long
before
the
order
of
release
of
a
young
english
painter
millais
who
had
just
leaped
into
fame
and
my
impression
of
the
rare
treatment
of
whose
baby
bare
legs
pendent
from
its
mother
arms
is
still
as
vivid
to
me
as
if
from
yesterday
the
vivid
yields
again
to
the
vague
i
scarce
know
why
so
utterly
till
consciousness
waking
up
in
london
renews
itself
late
one
evening
and
very
richly
at
the
gloucester
hotel
or
as
i
think
it
was
then
still
called
which
occupied
that
corner
of
piccadilly
and
berkeley
street
where
more
modern
establishments
have
since
succeeded
it
but
where
a
fatigued
and
famished
american
family
found
on
that
occasion
a
fine
old
british
virtue
in
cold
roast
beef
and
bread
and
cheese
and
ale
their
expert
acclamation
of
which
echoes
even
now
in
my
memory
it
keeps
company
there
with
other
matters
equally
british
and
as
we
say
now
early
victorian
the
thick
gloom
of
the
inn
rooms
the
faintness
of
the
glimmering
tapers
the
blest
inexhaustibility
of
the
fine
joint
surpassed
only
by
that
of
the
grave
waiter
reserve
plain
immutably
plain
fare
all
but
prompting
in
our
elders
an
emphasis
of
relief
and
relish
the
there
nothing
like
it
after
all
tone
which
expectation
which
in
fact
seemed
this
time
to
a
basis
for
faith
and
joy
that
basis
presently
shrank
to
the
scale
of
a
small
house
hard
by
the
hotel
at
the
entrance
of
berkeley
square
expeditiously
lighted
on
it
would
thus
appear
which
again
has
been
expensively
superseded
but
to
the
ancient
little
facts
of
which
i
fondly
revert
since
i
owe
them
what
i
feel
to
have
been
in
the
far
past
the
prime
faint
revelation
the
small
broken
expression
of
the
london
i
was
afterwards
to
know
the
place
wears
on
the
spot
to
this
day
no
very
different
face
the
house
that
has
risen
on
the
site
of
ours
is
still
immediately
neighboured
at
the
left
by
the
bookseller
the
and
who
modestly
flourished
in
our
time
under
the
same
name
the
great
establishment
of
gunter
just
further
along
is
as
soberly
and
solidly
seated
the
mews
behind
the
whole
row
from
the
foot
of
hay
hill
at
the
right
wanders
away
to
bruton
street
with
the
irregular
grace
that
spoke
to
my
young
fancy
hay
hill
itself
is
somehow
less
sharply
precipitous
besides
being
no
longer
paved
as
i
seem
to
recall
its
having
been
with
big
boulders
and
i
was
on
the
point
of
saying
that
its
antique
charm
in
some
degree
abides
nothing
however
could
be
further
from
the
truth
its
antique
charm
quite
succumbed
years
ago
to
that
erection
of
lumpish
mansions
which
followed
the
demolition
of
the
as
the
say
standing
on
the
south
side
between
court
and
i
suppose
garden
where
dover
street
gives
way
to
grafton
a
house
of
many
histories
of
vague
importances
and
cold
reserves
and
deep
suggestions
i
used
to
think
after
scaling
the
steep
quite
on
purpose
to
wonder
about
it
a
whole
chapter
of
life
was
condensed
for
our
young
sensibility
i
make
out
into
the
couple
of
months
they
can
scarce
have
been
more
spent
by
us
in
these
quarters
which
must
have
proved
too
narrow
and
too
towny
but
it
can
have
had
no
passage
so
lively
as
the
occurrences
at
once
sequent
to
my
having
too
candidly
made
known
in
some
public
print
probably
the
times
that
an
american
gentleman
at
such
an
address
desired
to
arrange
with
a
competent
young
man
for
the
tuition
at
home
of
his
three
sons
the
effect
of
his
rash
failure
to
invite
application
by
letter
only
was
the
assault
of
an
army
of
visitors
who
filled
us
with
consternation
they
hung
about
the
door
cumbered
the
hall
choked
the
staircase
and
sat
grimly
individual
in
odd
corners
how
they
were
dealt
with
given
my
father
precipitate
and
general
charity
i
can
but
feebly
imagine
our
own
concern
in
the
event
was
with
a
sole
selected
presence
that
of
scotch
robert
thompson
who
gave
us
his
care
from
breakfast
to
luncheon
each
morning
that
winter
who
afterwards
carried
on
a
school
at
edinburgh
and
whom
in
years
long
subsequent
i
happened
to
help
stevenson
to
recognise
gaily
as
early
pedagogue
he
was
so
deeply
solicitous
yet
withal
so
mild
and
kind
and
shy
with
no
harsher
injunction
to
us
ever
than
come
now
be
getting
on
that
one
could
but
think
well
of
a
world
in
which
so
gentle
a
spirit
might
flourish
while
it
is
doubtless
to
the
credit
of
his
temper
that
remembrance
is
a
blank
in
respect
to
his
closer
ministrations
i
recall
vividly
his
fresh
complexion
his
very
round
clear
eyes
his
tendency
to
trip
over
his
own
legs
or
feet
while
thoughtfully
circling
about
us
and
his
constant
worn
with
trousers
of
a
lighter
hue
which
was
perhaps
the
prescribed
uniform
of
a
daily
tutor
then
but
i
ask
myself
in
vain
what
i
can
have
studied
with
him
there
remaining
with
me
afterwards
to
testify
this
putting
any
scrap
of
stored
learning
aside
no
single
textbook
save
the
lambs
tales
from
shakespeare
which
was
given
me
as
of
all
things
in
the
world
a
reward
a
reward
for
what
i
am
again
at
a
loss
to
say
not
certainly
for
having
got
on
to
anything
like
the
tune
plaintively
for
the
most
part
piped
to
me
it
is
a
very
odd
and
yet
to
myself
very
rich
and
full
reminiscence
though
i
remember
how
looking
back
at
it
from
after
days
denounced
it
to
me
and
with
it
the
following
year
and
more
spent
in
paris
as
a
poor
and
arid
and
lamentable
time
in
which
missing
such
larger
chances
and
connections
as
we
might
have
reached
out
to
we
had
done
nothing
he
and
i
but
walk
about
together
in
a
state
of
the
direst
propriety
little
high
black
hats
and
inveterate
gloves
the
childish
costume
of
the
place
and
period
to
stare
at
grey
that
of
early
victorian
london
had
tones
of
a
neutrality
dawdle
at
and
buy
and
brushes
with
which
to
bedaub
eternal
we
might
i
dare
say
have
felt
higher
impulses
and
carried
out
larger
plans
though
indeed
present
to
me
for
this
on
my
brother
so
expressing
himself
is
my
then
quick
recognition
of
the
deeper
stirrings
and
braver
needs
he
at
least
must
have
known
and
my
perfect
if
rueful
sense
of
having
myself
had
no
such
quarrel
with
our
conditions
embalmed
for
me
did
they
even
to
that
shorter
retrospect
appear
in
a
sort
of
fatalism
of
patience
spiritless
in
a
manner
no
doubt
yet
with
an
inwardly
active
productive
and
ingenious
side
it
was
just
the
fact
of
our
having
so
walked
and
dawdled
and
dodged
that
made
the
charm
of
memory
in
addition
to
which
what
could
one
have
asked
more
than
to
be
steeped
in
a
medium
so
dense
that
whole
elements
of
it
forms
of
amusement
interest
and
wonder
soaked
through
to
some
appreciative
faculty
and
made
one
fail
at
the
most
of
nothing
but
lessons
my
brother
was
right
in
so
far
as
that
my
question
the
one
i
have
just
reproduced
could
have
been
asked
only
by
a
person
incorrigible
in
throwing
himself
back
upon
substitutes
for
lost
causes
substitutes
that
might
have
appeared
queer
and
small
a
person
so
haunted
even
from
an
early
age
with
visions
of
life
that
aridities
for
him
were
half
a
terror
and
half
an
impossibility
and
that
the
said
substitutes
the
economies
and
ingenuities
that
protested
in
their
dumb
vague
way
against
weakness
of
situation
or
of
direct
and
applied
faculty
were
in
themselves
really
a
revel
of
spirit
and
thought
it
indeed
again
an
effect
of
almost
pathetic
incoherence
that
our
brave
quest
of
the
languages
suffering
so
prompt
and
for
the
time
at
least
so
accepted
and
now
so
inscrutably
irrecoverable
a
check
should
have
contented
itself
with
settling
us
by
that
christmas
in
a
house
more
propitious
to
our
development
in
john
wood
where
we
enjoyed
a
considerable
garden
and
wistful
view
though
by
that
windowed
privilege
alone
of
a
large
green
expanse
in
which
ladies
and
gentlemen
practised
archery
just
and
not
the
art
even
but
the
mere
spectacle
might
have
been
one
of
the
substitutes
in
question
if
not
for
the
languages
at
least
for
one
or
another
of
the
romantic
connections
we
seemed
a
little
to
have
missed
it
was
such
a
whiff
of
the
old
world
of
robin
hood
as
we
could
never
have
looked
up
from
the
mere
thumbed
story
in
fourteenth
street
at
any
rate
to
any
soft
confidence
of
more
than
i
can
begin
to
say
that
is
by
a
greater
number
of
queer
small
channels
did
the
world
about
us
thus
continuous
with
the
old
world
of
robin
hood
steal
into
my
sense
a
constant
state
of
subjection
to
which
fact
is
no
bad
instance
of
those
refinements
of
surrender
that
i
just
named
as
my
fond
practice
i
seem
to
see
that
the
london
of
the
was
even
to
the
weak
perception
of
childhood
a
much
less
generalised
a
much
more
eccentrically
and
variously
characterised
place
than
the
present
great
accommodated
and
accommodating
city
it
had
fewer
resources
but
it
had
many
more
features
scarce
one
of
which
failed
to
help
the
whole
to
bristle
with
what
a
little
gaping
american
could
take
for
an
intensity
of
difference
from
supposed
order
it
was
extraordinarily
the
picture
and
the
scene
of
dickens
now
so
changed
and
superseded
it
offered
to
my
presumptuous
vision
still
more
the
reflection
of
thackeray
and
where
is
the
of
the
reflection
of
thackeray
now
so
that
as
i
trod
the
vast
length
of
baker
street
the
thackerayan
vista
of
other
days
i
throbbed
with
the
pride
of
a
vastly
enlarged
acquaintance
i
dare
say
our
perambulations
of
baker
street
in
our
little
top
hats
and
other
neatnesses
must
have
been
what
meant
by
our
poverty
of
life
whereas
it
was
probably
one
of
the
very
things
most
expressive
to
myself
of
the
charm
and
the
colour
of
history
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
picturesque
of
society
we
were
often
in
baker
street
by
reason
of
those
walks
at
the
remembered
frequency
and
push
of
which
i
am
amazed
recalling
at
the
same
time
however
that
save
for
robert
thompson
pitching
ball
with
us
in
the
garden
they
took
for
us
the
place
of
all
other
agilities
i
ca
but
feel
them
to
have
been
marked
in
their
way
by
a
rare
curiosity
and
energy
good
thompson
had
followed
us
in
our
move
occupying
quarters
not
far
off
above
a
baker
shop
on
a
terrace
a
group
of
objects
still
untouched
by
time
where
we
occasionally
by
way
of
change
attended
for
our
lessons
and
where
not
the
least
of
our
inspirations
was
the
confidence
again
and
again
justified
that
our
break
would
determine
the
appearance
of
a
stale
cake
straight
from
below
received
by
us
all
each
time
as
if
it
had
been
a
sudden
happy
thought
and
ushered
in
by
a
little
girl
who
might
have
been
a
dickens
foundling
or
orfling
our
being
reduced
to
mumble
cake
in
a
suburban
lodging
by
way
of
reaction
from
the
strain
of
study
would
have
been
perhaps
a
pathetic
picture
but
we
had
too
when
we
accompanied
our
excellent
friend
to
the
tower
the
thames
tunnel
paul
and
the
abbey
to
say
nothing
of
the
zoological
gardens
almost
close
at
hand
and
with
which
we
took
in
that
age
of
lingering
forms
no
liberty
of
abbreviation
to
say
nothing
either
of
madame
tussaud
then
in
our
interminable
but
so
amiable
baker
street
the
only
shade
on
the
amiability
of
which
was
just
that
gruesome
association
with
the
portal
of
the
bazaar
since
madame
tussaud
had
of
all
her
treasures
most
vividly
revealed
to
me
the
manning
and
the
burke
and
hare
of
the
chamber
of
horrors
which
lurked
just
within
it
whom
for
days
after
making
their
acquaintance
and
prolonging
it
no
further
than
our
conscientious
friend
thought
advisable
i
half
expected
when
alone
to
meet
quite
dreadfully
on
the
staircase
or
on
opening
a
door
all
this
experience
was
valuable
but
it
was
not
the
languages
save
in
so
far
indeed
as
it
was
the
english
which
we
had
in
advance
so
much
aimed
at
yet
which
more
or
less
and
very
interestingly
came
it
at
any
rate
perhaps
broke
our
fall
a
little
that
french
of
a
sort
continued
to
be
with
us
in
the
remarkably
erect
person
of
mademoiselle
cusin
the
swiss
governess
who
had
accompanied
us
from
geneva
whose
quite
sharply
extrusive
but
on
the
whole
exhilarating
presence
i
associate
with
this
winter
and
who
led
in
that
longish
procession
of
more
or
less
similar
domesticated
presences
which
was
to
keep
the
torch
that
is
the
accent
among
us
fairly
alight
the
variety
and
frequency
of
the
arrivals
and
departures
of
these
ladies
whose
ghostly
names
again
so
far
as
i
recall
them
i
like
piously
to
preserve
augustine
danse
amélie
fortin
marie
guyard
marie
bonningue
félicie
bonningue
clarisse
bader
mystifies
me
in
much
the
same
degree
as
our
own
academic
vicissitudes
in
new
york
i
can
no
more
imagine
why
sociable
and
charitable
we
so
often
changed
governesses
than
i
had
contemporaneously
grasped
the
principle
of
our
succession
of
schools
the
whole
group
of
phenomena
reflected
i
gather
as
a
rule
much
more
the
extreme
promptitude
of
the
parental
optimism
than
any
disproportionate
habit
of
impatience
the
optimism
begot
precipitation
and
the
precipitation
had
too
often
to
confess
itself
what
is
instructive
what
is
historic
is
the
probability
that
young
persons
offering
themselves
at
that
time
as
guides
and
communicators
the
requirements
of
our
small
sister
were
for
long
modest
enough
quite
conceivably
lacked
preparedness
and
were
so
thrown
back
on
the
extempore
which
in
turn
lacked
abundance
one
of
these
figures
that
of
mademoiselle
danse
the
most
parisian
and
prodigiously
so
was
afterwards
to
stand
out
for
us
quite
luridly
a
cloud
of
revelations
succeeding
her
withdrawal
a
cloud
which
thick
as
it
was
never
obscured
our
impression
of
her
genius
and
her
charm
the
daughter
of
a
political
proscript
who
had
but
just
escaped
by
the
legend
being
seized
in
his
bed
on
the
terrible
night
of
the
and
who
wrote
her
micawberish
letters
from
gallipolis
ohio
she
subsequently
figured
to
my
imagination
in
the
light
that
is
of
the
divined
revelations
too
dreadful
for
our
young
ears
as
the
most
brilliant
and
most
genial
of
irregular
characters
exhibiting
the
parisian
mentality
at
its
highest
or
perhaps
rather
its
deepest
and
more
remarkable
for
nothing
than
for
the
consummate
little
art
and
grace
with
which
she
had
for
a
whole
year
draped
herself
in
the
mantle
of
our
innocent
air
it
was
exciting
it
was
really
valuable
to
have
to
that
extent
rubbed
shoulders
with
an
adventuress
it
showed
one
that
for
the
adventuress
there
might
on
occasion
be
much
to
be
said
those
however
were
later
things
extensions
of
view
hampered
for
the
present
as
i
have
noted
by
our
mere
london
which
had
much
to
build
out
for
us
i
see
again
that
we
but
endlessly
walked
and
endlessly
daubed
and
that
our
walks
with
an
obsession
of
their
own
constantly
abetted
our
daubing
we
knew
no
other
boys
at
all
and
we
even
saw
no
others
i
seem
to
remember
save
the
essentially
rude
ones
rude
with
a
kind
of
mediæval
rudeness
for
which
our
clear
new
york
experience
had
given
us
no
precedent
and
of
which
the
great
and
constant
sign
was
the
artless
invidious
wonder
produced
in
them
on
our
public
appearances
by
the
alien
stamp
in
us
that
for
our
comfort
we
vainly
sought
to
dissimulate
we
conformed
in
each
particular
so
far
as
we
could
to
the
prevailing
fashion
and
standard
of
a
narrow
range
in
those
days
but
in
our
very
plumage
putting
our
aside
our
wild
must
have
seemed
to
sound
so
sharply
we
challenged
when
abroad
the
attention
of
our
native
contemporaries
and
even
sometimes
of
their
elders
pulled
up
at
sight
of
us
in
the
stare
a
curiosity
void
of
sympathy
and
that
attached
itself
for
some
reason
especially
to
our
feet
which
were
not
abnormally
large
the
london
people
had
for
themselves
at
the
same
time
an
exuberance
of
type
we
found
it
in
particular
a
world
of
costume
often
of
very
odd
costume
the
most
intimate
notes
of
which
were
the
postmen
in
their
of
military
red
and
their
black
beaver
hats
the
milkwomen
in
hats
that
often
emulated
these
in
little
shawls
and
strange
short
full
frocks
revealing
enormous
boots
with
their
pails
swung
from
their
shoulders
on
wooden
yokes
the
inveterate
footmen
hooked
behind
the
coaches
of
the
rich
frequently
in
pairs
and
carrying
staves
together
with
the
mounted
and
belted
grooms
without
the
attendance
of
whom
riders
of
whichever
sex
and
riders
then
were
much
more
numerous
almost
never
went
forth
the
range
of
character
on
the
other
hand
reached
rather
dreadfully
down
there
were
embodied
and
exemplified
horrors
in
the
streets
beside
which
any
present
exhibition
is
pale
and
i
well
remember
the
almost
terrified
sense
of
their
salience
produced
in
me
a
couple
of
years
later
on
the
occasion
of
a
flying
return
from
the
continent
with
my
father
by
a
long
an
interminable
drive
westward
from
the
london
bridge
it
was
a
soft
june
evening
with
a
lingering
light
and
swarming
crowds
as
they
then
seemed
to
me
of
figures
reminding
me
of
george
artful
dodger
and
his
bill
sikes
and
his
nancy
only
with
the
bigger
brutality
of
life
which
pressed
upon
the
cab
the
fourwheeler
as
we
jogged
over
the
bridge
and
cropped
up
in
more
and
more
patches
for
all
our
course
culminating
somewhere
far
to
the
west
in
the
vivid
picture
framed
by
the
of
a
woman
reeling
backward
as
a
man
felled
her
to
the
ground
with
a
blow
in
the
face
the
london
view
at
large
had
in
fact
more
than
a
cruikshank
there
still
survived
in
it
quite
a
hogarth
side
which
i
had
of
course
then
no
name
for
but
which
i
was
so
sharply
to
recognise
on
coming
back
years
later
that
it
fixed
for
me
the
veracity
of
the
great
pictorial
chronicler
hogarth
mark
is
even
yet
not
wholly
overlaid
though
time
has
dealt
with
that
stale
servility
of
address
which
most
expressed
to
our
young
minds
the
rich
burden
of
a
past
the
consequence
of
too
much
history
i
liked
for
my
own
part
a
lot
of
history
but
felt
in
face
of
certain
queer
old
obsequiosities
and
appeals
whinings
and
sidlings
and
and
the
general
play
of
apology
and
humility
behind
which
the
great
dim
social
complexity
seemed
to
mass
itself
that
one
did
quite
want
so
inordinate
a
quantity
of
that
particular
light
and
shade
however
the
big
broom
of
change
has
swept
the
scene
bare
more
history
still
has
been
after
all
what
it
wanted
quite
another
order
in
the
whole
connection
strikes
me
as
reigning
though
not
without
the
reminder
from
it
that
the
relations
in
which
manner
as
a
generalised
thing
in
which
tone
is
pleasant
is
really
assured
and
sound
clear
and
interesting
are
numerous
and
definite
only
when
it
has
had
in
its
past
some
strange
phases
and
much
misadventure
xxiii
we
were
still
being
but
vaguely
formed
yet
it
was
a
vagueness
preferred
apparently
by
our
parents
to
the
only
definiteness
in
any
degree
open
to
us
that
of
the
english
school
away
from
home
the
london
private
school
near
home
they
would
absolutely
none
of
which
they
saw
as
a
fearful
and
wonderful
though
seemingly
effective
preparation
of
the
young
for
english
life
and
an
english
career
but
related
to
that
situation
only
so
little
related
in
fact
to
any
other
as
to
make
it
in
a
differing
case
an
educational
the
worst
of
economies
they
had
doubtless
heard
claimed
for
it
just
that
no
other
method
for
boys
so
splendidly
general
but
they
had
i
judge
their
own
sense
of
the
matter
which
would
have
been
that
it
all
depended
on
what
was
meant
by
this
the
truth
was
above
all
that
to
them
the
formative
forces
most
closely
bearing
on
us
were
not
in
the
least
vague
but
very
definite
by
measure
and
intention
there
were
advantages
generally
much
belauded
that
appealed
to
them
scantly
and
other
matters
conceptions
of
character
and
opportunity
ideals
values
importances
enjoying
no
great
common
credit
but
for
which
it
was
their
belief
that
they
under
whatever
difficulties
more
or
less
provided
in
respect
of
which
i
further
remind
myself
of
the
blest
fewness
as
yet
of
our
years
and
i
come
back
to
my
own
sense
benighted
though
it
may
have
been
of
a
and
remarkably
active
life
i
recognise
our
immediate
our
practical
ferment
even
in
our
decent
perambulations
our
discussions
w
j
and
mine
of
whether
we
had
in
a
given
case
best
apply
for
a
renewal
of
our
artists
materials
to
rowney
or
to
windsor
and
newton
and
in
our
pious
resort
on
these
determinations
to
rathbone
place
more
beset
by
our
steps
probably
than
any
other
single
corner
of
the
town
and
the
short
but
charged
vista
of
which
lives
for
me
again
in
the
tempered
light
of
those
old
winter
afternoons
of
scarce
less
moment
than
these
were
our
frequent
visits
in
the
same
general
connection
to
the
old
pantheon
of
oxford
street
now
fallen
from
its
high
estate
but
during
that
age
a
place
of
fine
rococo
traditions
a
bazaar
an
exhibition
an
opportunity
at
the
end
of
long
walks
for
the
consumption
of
buns
and
and
above
all
a
monument
to
the
genius
of
that
wonderful
painter
haydon
we
must
at
one
time
quite
have
haunted
the
pantheon
where
we
doubtless
could
better
than
elsewhere
sink
to
contemplative
to
ruminative
rest
haydon
huge
canvases
covered
the
walls
i
wonder
what
has
become
now
of
the
banishment
of
aristides
attended
to
the
city
gate
by
his
wife
and
babe
every
attitude
and
figure
in
which
especially
that
of
the
foreshortened
boy
picking
up
stones
to
shy
at
the
stares
out
at
me
still
we
found
in
these
works
remarkable
interest
and
beauty
the
reason
of
which
was
partly
no
doubt
that
we
hung
to
fascination
at
home
over
the
three
volumes
of
the
hapless
artist
autobiography
then
a
new
book
which
our
father
indulgent
to
our
preoccupation
had
provided
us
with
but
i
blush
to
risk
the
further
surmise
that
the
grand
manner
the
heroic
and
the
classic
in
haydon
came
home
to
us
more
warmly
and
humanly
than
in
the
masters
commended
as
old
who
at
the
national
gallery
seemed
to
meet
us
so
little
to
hold
out
the
hand
of
fellowship
or
suggest
something
that
could
do
or
could
at
least
want
to
the
beauty
of
haydon
was
just
that
he
was
new
shiningly
new
and
if
he
hinted
that
we
might
perhaps
in
some
happy
future
emulate
his
big
bravery
there
was
nothing
so
impossible
about
it
if
we
adored
daubing
we
preferred
it
and
the
genius
of
the
pantheon
was
fresh
whereas
strange
to
say
rubens
and
titian
were
not
even
the
charm
of
the
pantheon
yielded
however
to
that
of
the
english
collection
the
vernon
bequest
to
the
nation
then
arrayed
at
marlborough
house
and
to
which
the
great
plumed
and
draped
and
dusty
funeral
car
of
the
duke
of
wellington
formed
an
attractive
adjunct
the
chambers
there
none
of
them
at
that
time
royally
inhabited
come
back
to
me
as
altogether
bleak
and
bare
and
as
owing
their
only
dignity
to
maclise
mulready
and
landseer
to
david
wilkie
and
charles
leslie
were
by
some
english
mystery
the
real
unattainable
just
as
they
were
none
the
less
the
directly
inspiring
and
the
endlessly
delightful
i
could
never
have
enough
of
maclise
in
hamlet
which
i
supposed
the
finest
composition
in
the
world
though
ophelia
did
look
a
little
as
if
cut
in
silhouette
out
of
white
paper
and
pasted
on
while
as
i
gazed
and
gazed
again
at
leslie
sancho
panza
and
his
duchess
i
pushed
through
the
great
hall
of
romance
to
the
central
or
private
apartments
trafalgar
square
had
its
straight
message
for
us
only
in
the
exhibition
the
royal
academy
of
those
days
having
without
a
home
of
its
own
to
borrow
space
from
the
national
gallery
space
partly
occupied
in
the
summer
of
by
the
first
fresh
fruits
of
the
efflorescence
among
which
i
distinguish
millais
vale
of
rest
his
autumn
leaves
and
if
i
am
not
mistaken
his
prodigious
blind
girl
the
very
word
wore
for
us
that
intensity
of
meaning
not
less
than
of
mystery
that
thrills
us
in
its
perfection
but
for
one
season
the
prime
hour
of
first
initiations
and
i
may
perhaps
somewhat
mix
the
order
of
our
great
little
passages
of
perception
momentous
to
us
again
was
to
be
the
academy
show
of
where
there
were
from
the
same
wide
source
still
other
challenges
to
wonder
holman
hunt
scapegoat
most
of
all
which
i
remember
finding
so
charged
with
the
awful
that
i
was
glad
i
saw
it
in
company
in
company
and
i
the
same
i
believed
or
tried
to
believe
i
should
have
feared
to
face
it
all
alone
in
a
room
by
that
time
moreover
i
mean
by
we
had
been
more
fully
indoctrinated
or
such
was
the
case
at
least
with
for
whom
in
paris
during
the
winter
of
instruction
at
the
atelier
of
léon
coigniet
of
a
limited
order
and
adapted
to
his
years
had
been
candidly
provided
that
léon
coigniet
whose
marius
meditating
among
the
ruins
of
carthage
impressed
us
the
more
at
the
luxembourg
even
more
haunted
by
us
in
due
course
than
the
pantheon
had
been
in
consequence
of
this
family
connection
let
me
not
however
nip
the
present
thread
of
our
æsthetic
evolution
without
a
glance
at
that
comparatively
spare
but
deeply
appreciated
experience
of
the
london
theatric
privilege
which
so
far
as
occasion
favoured
us
also
pressed
the
easy
spring
the
new
york
familiarities
had
to
drop
going
to
the
play
presented
itself
in
london
as
a
serious
ponderous
business
a
procession
of
two
throbbing
and
heaving
cabs
over
vast
foggy
tracts
of
the
town
after
much
arrangement
in
advance
and
with
a
renewal
of
far
peregrination
through
twisting
passages
and
catacombs
even
after
crossing
the
magic
threshold
we
sat
in
strange
places
with
still
stranger
ones
behind
or
beside
we
felt
walls
and
partitions
in
our
rear
getting
so
hot
that
we
wondered
if
the
house
was
to
burst
into
flame
i
recall
in
especial
our
being
arrayed
to
the
number
of
nine
persons
all
of
our
contingent
in
a
sort
of
rustic
balcony
or
verandah
which
simulating
the
outer
gallery
of
a
swiss
cottage
framed
in
creepers
formed
a
feature
of
albert
representation
of
the
tour
of
mont
blanc
big
bearded
rattling
chattering
mimicking
albert
smith
again
charms
my
senses
though
subject
to
the
reflection
that
his
type
and
presence
superficially
so
important
so
ample
were
somehow
at
odds
with
such
ingratiations
with
the
reckless
levity
of
his
performance
a
performance
one
of
the
great
effects
of
which
was
as
i
remember
it
the
very
brief
stop
and
of
the
train
at
épernay
with
the
ringing
of
bells
the
bawling
of
guards
the
cries
of
travellers
the
slamming
of
doors
and
the
tremendous
pop
as
of
a
colossal
made
all
simultaneous
and
vivid
by
smith
mere
personal
resources
and
graces
but
it
is
the
publicity
of
our
situation
as
a
happy
family
that
i
best
remember
and
how
to
our
embarrassment
we
seemed
put
forward
in
our
illustrative
châlet
as
part
of
the
boisterous
show
and
of
what
had
been
paid
for
by
the
house
two
other
great
evenings
stand
out
for
me
as
not
less
collectively
enjoyed
one
of
these
at
the
princess
then
under
the
management
of
charles
kean
the
unprecedented
as
he
was
held
shakespearean
revivalist
the
other
at
the
olympic
where
alfred
wigan
the
extraordinary
and
too
robson
and
the
shrewd
and
handsome
stirling
were
the
high
attraction
our
enjoyment
of
charles
kean
presentation
of
henry
the
eighth
figures
to
me
as
a
momentous
date
in
our
lives
we
did
nothing
for
weeks
afterwards
but
try
to
reproduce
in
queen
katharine
of
the
beckoning
consoling
angels
a
radiant
group
let
down
from
the
skies
by
machinery
then
thought
marvellous
when
indeed
we
were
not
parading
across
our
schoolroom
stage
as
the
portentous
cardinal
and
impressively
alternating
his
last
speech
to
cromwell
with
buckingham
that
is
with
ryder
address
on
the
way
to
the
scaffold
the
spectacle
had
seemed
to
us
prodigious
as
it
was
doubtless
at
its
time
the
last
word
of
costly
scenic
science
though
as
i
look
back
from
the
high
ground
of
an
age
that
has
mastered
tone
and
fusion
i
seem
to
see
it
as
comparatively
garish
and
violent
after
the
manner
of
the
complacently
approved
of
the
same
period
i
was
to
have
my
impression
of
charles
kean
renewed
later
on
ten
years
later
in
america
without
a
rag
of
scenic
reinforcement
when
i
was
struck
with
the
fact
that
no
actor
so
little
graced
by
nature
probably
ever
went
so
far
toward
repairing
it
by
a
kind
of
cold
rage
of
endeavour
were
he
and
his
wife
really
not
interesting
on
that
boston
night
of
macbeth
in
particular
had
their
art
a
distinction
that
triumphed
over
battered
age
and
sorry
harshness
or
was
i
but
too
easily
beguiled
by
the
old
association
i
have
enjoyed
and
forgotten
numberless
rich
hours
of
spectatorship
but
somehow
still
find
hooked
to
the
wall
of
memory
the
picture
of
this
hushed
couple
in
the
castle
court
with
the
knocking
at
the
gate
with
macbeth
stare
of
pitiful
horror
at
his
unused
daggers
and
with
the
grand
manner
up
to
the
height
of
the
argument
of
kean
coldly
portentous
snatch
of
them
what
i
especially
owe
that
lady
is
my
sense
of
what
she
had
in
common
as
a
queer
hooped
and
figure
of
large
circumference
and
archaic
attire
strange
tasteless
toggery
with
those
performers
of
the
past
who
are
preserved
for
us
on
the
small
canvases
of
hogarth
and
zoffany
she
helped
one
back
at
that
time
of
her
life
to
a
vision
of
the
cibbers
and
the
pritchards
so
affecting
may
often
be
such
recovered
links
i
see
the
evening
at
the
olympic
as
really
itself
partaking
of
that
antiquity
even
though
still
waters
run
deep
then
in
its
flourishing
freshness
and
as
to
which
i
remember
my
fine
old
friend
fanny
mentioning
to
me
in
the
distant
that
she
had
directed
tom
taylor
to
charles
de
bernard
novel
of
un
gendre
for
the
subject
of
it
passed
at
the
moment
for
a
highly
modern
social
study
it
is
perhaps
in
particular
through
the
memory
of
our
dismal
approach
to
the
theatre
the
squalid
slum
of
wych
street
then
incredibly
brutal
and
barbarous
as
an
avenue
to
joy
an
avenue
even
sometimes
for
the
muffled
coach
of
royalty
that
the
episode
affects
me
as
antedating
some
of
the
conditions
of
the
age
the
general
credit
of
which
i
should
add
was
highly
for
us
by
the
consummately
quiet
and
natural
art
as
we
expertly
pronounced
it
of
alfred
wigan
john
mildmay
and
the
breadth
and
sincerity
of
the
representative
of
the
rash
whom
he
so
imperturbably
puts
in
her
place
this
was
an
exhibition
supposed
in
its
day
to
leave
its
spectators
little
to
envy
in
the
highest
finish
reached
by
the
french
theatre
at
a
remarkable
height
in
a
different
direction
moved
the
strange
and
vivid
little
genius
of
robson
a
master
of
fantastic
intensity
unforgettable
for
us
we
felt
that
night
in
planché
extravaganza
of
the
discreet
princess
a
christmas
production
preluding
to
the
immemorial
harlequinade
i
still
see
robson
slide
across
the
stage
in
one
sidelong
wriggle
as
the
small
black
sinister
prince
richcraft
of
the
everything
he
did
at
once
very
dreadful
and
very
droll
thoroughly
true
and
yet
none
the
less
the
great
point
of
it
all
its
parody
of
charles
kean
in
the
corsican
brothers
a
vision
filled
out
a
couple
of
years
further
on
by
his
daddy
hardacre
in
a
version
of
a
parisian
piece
thriftily
and
coarsely
extracted
from
balzac
eugénie
grandet
this
occasion
must
have
given
the
real
and
the
finer
measure
of
his
highly
original
talent
so
present
to
me
despite
the
interval
is
the
distinctiveness
of
his
little
concentrated
rustic
miser
whose
daughter
helps
herself
from
his
so
that
her
cousin
and
lover
shall
save
a
desperate
father
her
paternal
uncle
from
bankruptcy
and
the
prodigious
effect
of
robson
appalled
descent
from
an
upper
floor
his
literal
headlong
tumble
and
rattle
of
dismay
down
a
steep
staircase
occupying
the
centre
of
the
stage
on
his
discovery
of
the
rifling
of
his
chest
long
was
i
to
have
in
my
ears
the
repeated
shriek
of
his
alarm
followed
by
a
panting
babble
of
wonder
and
rage
as
his
impetus
hurled
him
a
prostrate
scrap
of
despair
he
was
a
tiny
figure
yet
so
held
the
stage
that
in
his
company
you
could
see
nobody
else
half
way
across
the
room
i
associate
a
little
uncertainly
with
the
same
night
the
sight
of
charles
matthews
in
sheridan
critic
and
in
a
comedy
botched
from
the
french
like
everything
else
in
those
days
that
was
not
either
sheridan
or
shakespeare
called
married
for
money
an
example
above
all
this
association
of
the
heaped
measure
of
the
old
bills
vast
and
various
enumerations
as
they
were
of
the
size
of
but
slightly
reduced
placards
and
with
a
strange
and
delightful
greasy
feel
and
redolence
of
printer
ink
intensely
theatrical
ink
somehow
in
their
big
black
lettering
charles
matthews
must
have
been
then
in
his
and
him
too
wasted
and
aged
infinitely
marked
i
was
to
see
again
ever
so
long
after
in
america
an
impression
reminding
me
as
i
recover
it
of
how
one
took
his
talent
so
thoroughly
for
granted
that
he
seemed
somehow
to
get
but
half
the
credit
of
it
this
at
least
in
all
save
parts
of
mere
farce
and
patter
which
were
on
a
footing
and
no
very
interesting
one
of
their
own
the
other
effect
that
of
a
naturalness
so
easy
and
immediate
so
friendly
and
intimate
that
relation
with
the
artist
lost
itself
in
one
relation
with
the
character
the
artist
thereby
somehow
positively
suffering
while
the
character
gained
or
at
least
while
the
spectator
did
this
comes
back
to
me
quite
as
a
part
even
of
my
earlier
experience
and
as
attesting
on
behalf
of
the
actor
a
remarkable
genius
since
there
are
no
more
charming
artistic
cases
than
those
of
the
frank
result
when
it
is
frank
and
the
dissimulated
process
when
the
dissimulation
has
been
deep
to
drop
or
appear
to
drop
machinery
and
yet
keep
or
at
least
gain
intensity
the
interesting
intensity
separated
by
a
gulf
from
a
mere
unbought
coincidence
of
aspect
or
organ
is
really
to
do
something
in
spite
of
which
at
the
same
time
what
i
perhaps
most
retain
by
the
light
of
the
present
of
the
sense
of
that
big
and
rather
dusky
night
of
drury
lane
is
not
so
much
the
felt
degree
of
anyone
talent
as
the
fact
that
personality
and
artistry
their
intensity
could
work
their
spell
in
such
a
material
desert
in
conditions
intrinsically
so
charmless
so
bleak
and
bare
the
conditions
gave
nothing
of
what
we
regard
as
most
indispensable
since
our
present
fine
conception
is
but
to
reduce
and
fill
in
the
material
desert
to
people
and
carpet
and
curtain
it
we
may
be
right
so
far
as
that
goes
but
our
predecessors
were
with
their
eye
on
the
essence
not
wrong
thanks
to
which
they
wear
the
crown
of
our
now
thinking
of
them
if
we
do
think
of
them
as
in
their
way
giants
and
heroes
what
their
successors
were
to
become
is
another
question
very
much
better
dressed
beyond
all
doubt
xxiv
good
robert
thompson
was
followed
by
lerambert
who
was
surely
good
too
in
his
different
way
good
at
least
for
feigning
an
interest
he
could
scarce
have
rejoicingly
felt
and
that
he
yet
somehow
managed
to
give
a
due
impression
of
that
artifice
being
as
we
must
dimly
have
divined
at
the
time
in
fact
i
make
bold
to
say
that
i
personally
did
divine
it
exactly
a
sign
of
his
of
no
such
uncanny
engine
had
thompson
luckily
known
a
need
luckily
since
to
what
arsenal
could
he
possibly
have
resorted
for
it
none
capable
of
supplying
it
could
ever
have
met
his
sight
and
we
ourselves
should
at
a
pinch
have
had
to
help
him
toward
it
he
was
easily
interested
or
at
least
took
an
easy
view
on
such
ground
as
we
offered
him
of
what
it
was
to
be
so
whereas
his
successor
attached
to
the
condition
a
different
value
one
recognising
no
secondary
substitute
perhaps
this
was
why
our
connection
with
lerambert
can
have
lasted
but
four
or
five
months
time
even
for
his
sharp
subterfuge
to
have
ceased
entirely
to
serve
him
though
indeed
even
as
i
say
this
i
vaguely
recall
that
our
separation
was
attended
with
friction
that
it
took
him
unaware
and
that
he
had
been
prepared
or
so
represented
himself
for
further
sacrifices
it
could
have
been
no
great
one
assuredly
to
deal
with
so
intensely
living
a
young
mind
as
my
elder
brother
it
could
have
been
but
a
happy
impression
constantly
renewed
but
we
two
juniors
wilky
and
i
were
a
drag
wilky
powers
most
displayed
at
that
time
in
his
preference
for
ingenuous
talk
over
any
other
pursuit
whatever
and
my
own
aptitude
showing
for
nil
according
to
our
poor
gentleman
report
of
me
when
a
couple
of
months
had
sped
save
as
to
rendering
la
fontaine
fables
into
english
with
a
certain
corresponding
felicity
of
idiom
i
remember
perfectly
the
parental
communication
to
me
of
this
fell
judgment
i
remember
as
well
the
interest
with
which
its
so
quite
definite
character
inspired
me
that
character
had
such
beauty
and
distinctness
yet
and
ever
so
strangely
i
recover
no
sense
of
having
been
crushed
and
this
even
though
destitute
utterly
of
any
ground
of
appeal
the
fact
leaves
me
at
a
loss
since
i
also
remember
my
not
having
myself
thought
particularly
well
in
the
connection
allowed
of
my
rendering
faculty
oh
i
seem
inwardly
to
have
said
if
it
were
to
be
if
it
only
could
be
a
question
of
rendering
and
so
without
confusion
though
in
vague
very
vague
mystification
to
have
left
it
as
if
so
many
things
intrinsic
and
extrinsic
would
have
to
change
and
operate
so
many
would
have
to
happen
so
much
water
have
to
flow
under
the
bridge
before
i
could
give
primary
application
to
such
a
thought
much
more
finish
such
a
sentence
all
of
which
is
but
a
way
of
saying
that
we
had
since
the
beginning
of
the
summer
settled
ourselves
in
paris
and
that
lerambert
by
what
agency
invoked
by
what
revelation
vouchsafed
i
quite
forget
was
at
this
time
attending
us
in
a
pavilion
of
middling
size
that
between
the
and
the
rue
du
colisée
hung
at
no
great
height
over
the
avenue
des
hung
that
is
from
the
vantage
of
its
own
considerable
terrace
surmounted
as
the
parapet
of
the
latter
was
with
iron
railings
rising
sufficiently
to
protect
the
place
for
familiar
use
and
covert
contemplation
we
ever
so
fondly
used
it
and
yet
not
to
the
point
of
fencing
out
life
a
blest
little
refuge
it
must
have
seemed
to
us
with
its
and
peculiarly
resonant
small
court
and
idle
beside
it
accessible
by
a
high
grille
where
the
jangle
of
the
bell
and
the
clatter
of
response
across
the
stones
might
have
figured
a
comprehensive
echo
of
all
old
paris
old
paris
then
even
there
considerably
lingered
i
recapture
much
of
its
presence
for
that
matter
within
our
odd
relic
of
a
house
the
property
of
an
american
southerner
from
whom
our
parents
had
briefly
hired
it
and
who
appeared
to
divide
his
time
poor
unadmonished
gentleman
of
the
eve
of
the
revolution
between
louisiana
and
france
what
association
could
have
breathed
more
from
the
queer
graces
and
the
queer
incommodities
alike
from
the
diffused
glassy
polish
of
floor
and
perilous
staircase
from
the
redundancy
of
mirror
and
clock
and
ormolu
vase
from
the
irrepressibility
of
the
white
and
gold
panel
from
that
merciless
elegance
of
tense
red
damask
above
all
which
made
the
backs
of
sofa
and
chair
as
sumptuous
no
doubt
but
as
sumptuously
stiff
as
the
brocaded
walls
it
was
amid
these
refinements
that
we
presently
resumed
our
studies
even
explicitly
far
from
arduous
at
first
as
the
were
perforce
that
year
our
summer
habitation
and
some
deference
was
due
to
the
place
and
the
season
lessons
of
any
sort
being
at
best
an
infraction
of
the
latter
lerambert
who
was
spare
and
tightly
spectacled
pale
and
prominently
intellectual
who
lived
in
the
rue
jacob
with
his
mother
and
sister
exactly
as
he
should
have
done
to
accentuate
prophetically
his
resemblance
save
for
the
spectacles
to
some
hero
of
victor
cherbuliez
and
who
in
fine
was
conscious
not
unimpressively
of
his
authorship
of
a
volume
of
meditative
verse
sympathetically
mentioned
by
the
of
the
causeries
in
a
review
of
the
young
poets
of
the
hour
lerambert
too
has
loved
lerambert
too
has
suffered
lerambert
too
has
sung
or
words
to
that
effect
this
subtle
personality
really
a
high
form
of
sensibility
i
surmise
and
as
qualified
for
other
and
intenser
relations
as
any
cherbuliez
figure
of
them
all
was
naturally
not
to
be
counted
on
to
lead
us
gapingly
forth
as
good
thompson
had
done
so
that
my
reminiscence
of
warm
somniferous
mornings
by
the
windows
that
opened
to
the
clattery
plashy
court
is
quite
so
far
as
my
record
goes
relievingly
unbroken
the
afternoons
however
glimmer
back
to
me
shamelessly
different
for
our
circle
had
promptly
been
joined
by
the
and
mademoiselle
danse
aforesaid
her
of
the
so
flexible
and
the
so
salient
smiling
eyes
than
which
even
those
of
miss
rebecca
sharp
that
other
epic
governess
were
not
more
pleasingly
green
who
provided
with
high
efficiency
for
our
immediate
looser
needs
mine
and
wilky
and
those
of
our
small
brother
bob
petit
robertson
as
she
was
to
dub
him
and
of
our
still
smaller
sister
at
least
our
first
fine
of
curiosity
her
brave
vaudoise
predecessor
had
been
bequeathed
by
us
in
london
to
a
higher
sphere
than
service
with
mere
earnest
nomads
could
represent
but
had
left
us
clinging
and
weeping
and
was
for
a
long
time
afterwards
to
write
to
us
faithfully
in
the
most
beautiful
hand
out
of
the
midst
of
her
rise
with
details
that
brought
home
to
us
as
we
had
never
known
it
brought
the
material
and
institutional
difference
between
the
nomadic
and
the
solidly
the
spreadingly
seated
a
couple
of
years
later
on
an
occasion
of
our
being
again
for
a
while
in
london
she
hastened
to
call
on
us
and
on
departing
amiably
invited
me
to
walk
back
with
her
for
a
gossip
it
was
a
bustling
day
of
june
across
a
long
stretch
of
the
town
when
i
left
her
at
a
glittering
portal
with
the
impression
of
my
having
in
our
transit
seen
much
of
society
the
old
london
season
filled
the
measure
had
length
and
breadth
and
thickness
to
an
extent
now
foregone
and
more
particularly
achieved
a
small
psychologic
study
noted
the
action
of
the
massive
english
machinery
directed
to
its
end
which
had
been
in
this
case
effectually
to
tame
the
presumptuous
and
work
over
the
crude
i
remember
on
that
occasion
retracing
my
steps
from
eaton
square
to
devonshire
street
with
a
lively
sense
of
observation
exercised
by
the
way
a
perfect
gleaning
of
golden
straws
our
guide
and
philosopher
of
the
summer
days
in
paris
was
no
such
character
as
that
she
had
arrived
among
us
and
consummate
fortunately
for
the
case
altogether
as
our
mere
candid
humanity
would
otherwise
have
had
scant
practical
pressure
to
bring
thackeray
novel
contains
a
plate
from
his
own
expressive
hand
representing
miss
sharp
lost
in
a
cynical
while
her
neglected
pupils
are
locked
in
a
scrimmage
on
the
floor
but
the
marvel
of
exemplar
of
the
becky
type
was
exactly
that
though
her
larger
her
more
interested
and
sophisticated
views
had
a
range
that
she
not
only
permitted
us
to
guess
but
agreeably
invited
us
to
follow
almost
to
their
furthest
limits
we
never
for
a
moment
ceased
to
be
aware
of
her
solicitude
we
might
we
must
so
tremendously
have
bored
her
but
no
ironic
artist
could
have
caught
her
at
any
juncture
in
the
posture
of
disgust
really
i
imagine
because
her
own
ironies
would
have
been
too
fine
for
him
and
too
numerous
and
too
mixed
and
this
remarkable
creature
vouchsafed
us
all
information
for
the
free
enjoyment
on
the
terms
proper
to
our
tender
years
of
her
beautiful
city
it
was
not
by
the
common
measure
then
so
beautiful
as
now
the
second
empire
too
lately
installed
was
still
more
or
less
feeling
its
way
with
the
great
free
hand
soon
to
be
allowed
to
baron
haussmann
marked
as
yet
but
in
the
light
preliminary
flourish
its
connections
with
the
past
however
still
hung
thickly
on
its
majesties
and
symmetries
comparatively
vague
and
general
were
subject
to
the
happy
accident
the
charming
lapse
and
the
odd
extrusion
a
bonhomie
of
chance
composition
and
colour
now
quite
purged
away
the
whole
region
of
the
where
we
must
after
all
at
first
have
principally
prowled
was
another
world
from
the
actual
huge
centre
of
repeated
radiations
the
splendid
avenue
as
we
of
course
already
thought
it
carried
the
eye
from
the
tuileries
to
the
arch
but
pleasant
old
places
abutted
on
it
by
the
way
gardens
and
terraces
and
hôtels
of
another
time
pavilions
still
braver
than
ours
cabarets
and
cafés
of
homely
almost
of
rural
type
with
a
relative
and
doubtless
rather
dusty
ruralism
spreading
away
to
the
river
and
the
wood
what
was
the
jardin
a
place
of
entertainment
standing
quite
over
against
us
and
that
looped
itself
at
night
with
little
coloured
a
mere
twinkling
grin
upon
the
face
of
pleasure
dim
my
impression
of
having
been
admitted
or
rather
i
suppose
conducted
though
under
conductorship
now
vague
to
me
to
view
it
by
colourless
day
when
it
must
have
worn
the
stamp
of
an
quite
void
of
the
lots
more
distinct
on
the
other
hand
the
image
of
the
bustling
barrière
at
the
top
of
the
avenue
on
the
hither
side
of
the
arch
where
the
old
began
at
once
and
the
two
matched
lodges
of
the
octroi
highly
that
is
expressly
even
if
humbly
architectural
guarded
the
entrance
on
either
side
with
such
a
suggestion
of
the
generations
and
dynasties
and
armies
the
revolutions
and
restorations
they
had
seen
come
and
go
but
the
avenue
of
the
empress
now
so
much
more
thinly
but
of
the
wood
itself
had
already
been
traced
as
the
empress
herself
young
more
than
young
attestedly
and
agreeably
and
fair
and
shining
was
up
and
down
the
vista
constantly
on
exhibition
with
the
thrill
of
that
surpassed
for
us
however
by
the
incomparable
passage
as
we
judged
it
of
the
baby
prince
imperial
borne
forth
for
his
airing
or
his
progress
to
in
the
splendid
coach
that
gave
a
glimpse
of
appointed
and
costumed
nursing
breasts
and
laps
and
beside
which
the
all
and
silver
and
intensely
erect
quick
jolt
rattled
with
pistols
raised
and
cocked
was
a
public
holiday
ever
more
splendid
than
that
of
the
prince
baptism
at
notre
dame
the
fête
of
or
was
any
ever
more
immortalised
as
we
say
than
this
one
was
to
be
by
the
wonderfully
ample
and
vivid
picture
of
it
in
the
eugène
rougon
of
emile
zola
who
must
have
taken
it
in
on
the
spot
as
a
boy
of
about
our
own
number
of
years
though
of
so
much
more
implanted
and
predestined
an
evocatory
gift
the
sense
of
that
interminable
hot
day
a
day
of
hanging
about
and
waiting
and
shuffling
in
dust
in
crowds
in
fatigue
amid
booths
and
pedlars
and
performers
and
false
alarms
and
expectations
and
renewed
reactions
and
rushes
all
transfigured
at
the
last
withal
by
the
biggest
and
brightest
illumination
up
to
that
time
offered
even
the
parisians
the
blinding
glare
of
the
new
empire
effectually
symbolised
the
vision
of
the
whole
i
say
comes
back
to
me
quite
in
the
form
of
a
chapter
from
the
with
its
effect
of
something
long
and
dense
and
heavy
without
shades
or
undertones
but
immensely
and
done
i
dare
say
that
for
those
months
our
contemplations
our
daily
exercise
in
general
strayed
little
beyond
the
though
i
recall
confusedly
as
well
certain
excursions
to
passy
and
auteuil
where
we
foregathered
with
small
resident
compatriots
the
easy
gutturalism
of
whose
french
an
unpremeditated
art
was
a
revelation
an
initiation
and
whence
we
roamed
for
purposes
of
picnic
into
parts
of
the
bois
de
boulogne
that
oddly
enough
figured
to
us
the
virgin
forest
better
than
anything
at
our
own
american
door
had
done
it
was
the
social
aspect
of
our
situation
that
most
appealed
to
me
none
the
less
for
i
detect
myself
as
i
woo
it
all
back
disengaging
a
social
aspect
again
and
more
than
ever
from
the
phenomena
disclosed
to
my
reflective
gape
or
to
otherwise
associated
strolls
perceptive
passages
not
wholly
independent
even
of
the
occupancy
of
chairs
within
the
charmed
circle
of
guignol
and
of
gringalet
i
suppose
i
should
have
blushed
to
confess
it
but
polichinelle
and
his
puppets
in
the
afternoons
under
an
umbrage
sparse
till
evening
fell
had
still
their
spell
to
cast
as
part
and
parcel
that
is
of
the
general
intensity
of
animation
and
variety
of
feature
the
amusement
the
æsthetic
and
human
appeal
of
paris
had
in
those
days
less
the
air
of
a
great
shining
conspiracy
to
please
the
machinery
in
movement
confessed
less
to
its
huge
purpose
but
manners
and
types
and
traditions
the
detail
of
the
scene
its
pointed
particulars
went
their
way
with
a
straighter
effect
as
well
as
often
with
a
homelier
grace
character
temper
and
tone
had
lost
comparatively
little
of
their
emphasis
these
scattered
accents
were
matter
for
our
eyes
and
ears
not
a
little
even
already
for
our
respective
imaginations
though
it
is
only
as
the
season
waned
and
we
set
up
our
fireside
afresh
and
for
the
winter
that
i
connect
my
small
revolution
with
a
wider
field
and
with
the
company
of
j
again
for
that
summer
he
was
to
be
in
eclipse
to
me
guignol
and
gringalet
failed
to
claim
his
attention
and
mademoiselle
danse
i
make
out
deprecated
his
theory
of
exact
knowledge
besides
thinking
him
perhaps
a
little
of
an
which
came
to
the
same
thing
we
adjourned
that
autumn
to
quarters
not
far
off
a
apartment
in
the
street
then
bravely
known
as
the
rue
and
now
after
other
mutations
as
the
rue
la
boëtie
which
we
were
again
to
exchange
a
year
later
for
an
abode
in
the
rue
montaigne
this
last
after
a
summer
absence
at
the
earlier
migration
setting
up
for
me
the
frame
of
a
considerably
animated
picture
animated
at
best
it
was
with
the
spirit
and
the
modest
facts
of
our
family
life
among
which
i
number
the
cold
finality
of
lerambert
reflected
in
still
other
testimonies
that
is
till
the
date
of
our
definite
but
respectful
rupture
with
him
followed
as
the
spring
came
on
by
our
ineluctable
phase
at
the
institution
fezandié
in
the
rue
balzac
of
which
latter
there
will
be
even
more
to
say
than
i
shall
take
freedom
for
with
the
rue
came
extensions
even
the
mere
immediate
view
of
opposite
intimacies
and
industries
the
subdivided
aspects
and
neat
ingenuities
of
the
applied
parisian
genius
counting
as
such
our
above
an
entresol
of
no
great
height
hung
over
the
narrow
and
during
the
winter
months
not
a
little
dusky
channel
with
endless
movement
and
interest
in
the
vivid
exhibition
it
supplied
what
faced
us
was
a
series
of
subjects
with
the
baker
at
the
corner
for
the
first
the
impeccable
dispenser
of
the
so
that
we
woke
up
each
morning
to
hunger
for
afresh
with
our
weak
as
for
the
one
form
of
european
fit
to
be
named
even
with
the
feeblest
of
our
american
forms
then
came
the
small
crêmerie
white
picked
out
with
blue
which
by
some
secret
of
its
own
keeping
afforded
within
the
compass
of
a
few
feet
square
prolonged
savoury
meals
to
working
men
or
to
uniformed
cabmen
stout
or
spare
but
all
more
or
less
audibly
and
discernibly
critical
and
next
the
compact
embrasure
of
the
écaillère
or
she
and
her
paraphernalia
fitted
into
their
interstice
much
as
the
mollusc
itself
into
its
shell
neighboured
in
turn
by
the
peeping
from
as
narrow
a
cage
his
neat
faggots
and
chopped
logs
stacked
beside
him
and
above
him
in
his
quite
as
the
niches
of
saints
in
early
italian
pictures
are
framed
with
fruits
and
flowers
space
and
remembrance
fail
me
for
the
rest
of
the
series
the
attaching
note
of
which
comes
back
as
the
note
of
diffused
sociability
and
domestic
in
fact
more
or
less
æsthetic
ingenuity
with
the
street
a
perpetual
parlour
or
household
centre
for
the
flitting
pausing
conversing
little
bourgeoise
or
ouvrière
to
sport
on
every
pretext
and
in
every
errand
her
fluted
cap
her
composed
head
her
neat
ankles
and
her
ready
wit
which
is
to
say
indeed
but
that
life
and
manners
were
more
pointedly
and
harmoniously
expressed
under
our
noses
there
than
we
had
perhaps
found
them
anywhere
save
in
the
most
salient
passages
of
stories
though
i
must
in
spite
of
it
not
write
as
if
these
trifles
were
all
our
fare
xxv
that
autumn
renewed
i
make
out
our
long
and
beguiled
walks
my
own
with
in
especial
at
the
same
time
that
i
have
somehow
the
sense
of
the
whole
more
broken
appeal
on
the
part
of
paris
the
scanter
confidence
and
ease
it
inspired
in
us
the
perhaps
more
numerous
and
composite
but
obscurer
and
more
baffled
intimations
not
indeed
for
all
my
brother
later
vision
of
an
accepted
flatness
in
it
that
there
was
not
some
joy
and
some
grasp
why
else
were
we
forever
as
i
seem
to
conceive
we
were
measuring
the
great
space
that
separated
us
from
the
gallery
of
the
luxembourg
every
step
of
which
either
way
we
took
it
fed
us
with
some
interesting
some
admirable
image
kept
us
in
relation
to
something
nobly
intended
that
particular
walk
was
not
prescribed
us
yet
we
appear
to
have
hugged
it
across
the
to
the
river
and
so
over
the
nearest
bridge
and
the
quays
of
the
left
bank
to
the
rue
de
seine
as
if
it
somehow
held
the
secret
of
our
future
to
the
extent
even
of
my
more
or
less
sneaking
off
on
occasion
to
take
it
by
myself
to
taste
of
it
with
a
due
undiverted
intensity
and
the
throb
as
of
the
finest
which
only
mean
the
most
parisian
adventure
the
further
quays
with
their
innumerable
old
bookshops
and
the
long
cases
of
each
of
these
commodities
exposed
on
the
parapets
in
especial
must
have
come
to
know
us
almost
as
well
as
we
knew
them
with
plot
thickening
and
emotion
deepening
steadily
however
as
we
mounted
the
long
black
rue
de
seine
a
stretch
of
perspective
an
intensity
of
tone
as
it
offered
in
those
days
where
every
vitrine
waylaid
us
and
we
moved
in
a
world
of
which
the
dark
message
expressed
in
we
could
have
said
what
sinister
way
too
might
have
been
art
art
art
do
you
see
learn
little
gaping
pilgrims
what
is
oh
we
learned
that
is
we
tried
to
as
hard
as
ever
we
could
and
were
fairly
well
at
it
i
always
felt
even
by
the
time
we
had
passed
up
into
that
comparatively
short
but
wider
and
finer
vista
of
the
rue
de
tournon
which
in
those
days
more
abruptly
crowned
the
more
compressed
approach
and
served
in
a
manner
as
a
great
outer
vestibule
to
the
palace
style
dimly
described
looked
down
there
as
with
conscious
encouragement
from
the
high
old
houses
very
much
as
if
wishing
to
say
yes
small
staring
jeune
homme
we
are
dignity
and
memory
and
measure
we
are
conscience
and
proportion
and
taste
not
to
mention
strong
sense
too
for
all
of
which
good
things
take
us
you
wo
find
one
of
them
when
you
find
as
going
soon
to
begin
to
at
such
a
rate
vulgarity
this
i
admit
was
an
abundance
of
remark
to
such
young
ears
but
it
did
all
i
maintain
tremble
in
the
air
with
the
sense
that
the
rue
de
tournon
cobbled
and
a
little
might
more
or
less
have
figured
some
fine
old
street
i
cherished
in
short
its
very
name
and
think
i
really
had
to
wait
to
prefer
the
then
the
unmenaced
the
inviolate
café
foyot
of
the
left
hand
corner
the
and
so
haunted
café
foyot
of
the
old

its
well

its
roaring
successor

wide
mouth
of
the
present
boulevard

round
the
corner

not
yet
been
forced

the

paris
still
pressed
round
the
palace
and
its
gardens
which
formed
the
right
the
sober
social
antithesis
to
the
elegant
tuileries
and
which
in
fine
with
these
renewals
of
our
young
confidence
reinforced
both
in
a
general
and
in
a
particular
way
one
of
the
fondest
of
our
literary
curiosities
of
that
time
the
conscientious
study
of
les
français
peints
par
rich
in
of
gavarni
of
grandville
of
which
we
held
it
rather
our
duty
to
admire
and
even
a
little
his
opportunity
to
copy
in
this
and
octavo
it
was
that
first
disclosed
to
me
forestalling
a
better
ground
of
acquaintance
the
great
name
of
balzac
who
in
common
with
every
other
light
writer
of
his
day
contributed
to
its
pages
had
i
pored
over
his
exposition
there
of
the
contrasted
types
of
des
tuileries
and
du
luxembourg
finding
it
very
in
fact
what
i
did
then
know
enough
to
call
very
stodgy
but
flavoured
withal
and
a
trifle
lubricated
by
gavarni
two
drawings
which
had
somehow
so
much
in
general
to
say
let
me
not
however
dally
by
the
way
when
nothing
at
those
hours
i
make
out
so
much
spoke
to
us
as
the
animated
pictured
halls
within
the
palace
primarily
those
of
the
senate
of
the
empire
but
then
also
forming
as
with
extensions
they
still
and
much
more
copiously
form
the
great
paris
museum
of
contemporary
art
this
array
was
at
that
stage
a
comparatively
though
only
comparatively
small
affair
in
spite
of
which
fact
we
supposed
it
vast
and
final
so
that
it
would
have
shocked
us
to
foreknow
how
in
many
a
case
and
of
the
most
cherished
cases
the
finality
was
to
break
down
most
of
the
works
of
the
modern
schools
that
we
most
admired
are
begging
their
bread
i
fear
from
door
to
door
that
is
from
one
provincial
museum
or
dim
back
seat
to
another
though
we
were
on
returns
to
draw
a
long
breath
for
the
saved
state
of
some
of
the
great
things
as
to
which
our
faith
had
been
clearest
it
had
been
clearer
for
none

recover
than
for
romains

la
décadence
recently
acclaimed
at
that
time
as
the
last
word
of
the
grand
manner
but
of
the
grand
manner
modernised
humanised
philosophised
redeemed
from
academic
death
so
that
it
was
to
this
master
school
that
the
young
american
contemporary
flutter
taught
its
wings
to
fly
straightest
and
that
i
could
never
in
the
long
aftertime
face
his

all
its
old

and
marvels
without
a
rush

and
a
stir

william
hunt
the
new
englander
of
genius
the
boston
painter
whose
authority
was
greatest
during
the
thirty
years
from
or
so
and
with
whom
for
a
time
in
the
early
period
was
to
work
all
devotedly
had
prolonged
his
studies
in
paris
under
the
inspiration
of
couture
and
of
edouard
frère
masters
in
a
group
completed
by
three
or
four
of
the
so
finely
interesting
landscapists
of
that
and
the
directly
previous
age
troyon
rousseau
daubigny
even
lambinet
and
others
and
which
summed
up
for
the
american
collector
and
in
the
new
york
and
boston
markets
the
idea
of
the
modern
in
the
masterly
it
was
a
comfortable
time
when
appreciation
could
go
so
straight
could
rise
and
rise
higher
without
critical
contortions
when
we
could
i
mean
be
both
so
intelligent
and
so
quiet
we
were
in
our
immediate
circle
to
know
couture
himself
a
little
toward
the
end
of
his
life
and
i
was
somewhat
to
wonder
then
where
he
had
picked
up
the
æsthetic
hint
for
the
beautiful
page
with
a
falcon
if
i
have
the
designation
right
his
other
great
bid
for
style
and
capture
of
it
which
we
were
long
to
continue
to
suppose
perhaps
the
rarest
of
all
modern
pictures
the
feasting
romans
were
conceivable
enough
i
mean
a
conception
no
mystery
hung
about
them
in
the
sense
of
asking
one
self
whence
they
had
come
and
by
what
romantic
or
roundabout
or
journey
which
is
that
air
of
the
poetic
shaken
out
as
from
strong
wings
when
great
presences
in
any
one
of
the
arts
appear
to
alight
what
i
remember
on
the
other
hand
of
the
splendid
fair
youth
in
black
velvet
and
satin
or
whatever
who
while
he
mounts
the
marble
staircase
shows
off
the
great
bird
on
his
forefinger
with
a
grace
that
shows
off
was
that
it
failed
to
help
us
to
divine
during
that
of
the
glory
of
which
i
speak
by
what
rare
chance
for
the
obscured
old
we
visited
the
heavens
had
once
opened
poetry
had
swooped
down
breathed
on
him
for
an
hour
and
fled
such
at
any
rate
are
the
of
reputations
which
it
contributes
to
the
interest
of
any
observational
lingering
on
this
planet
to
have
caught
so
repeatedly
in
their
weird
motion
the
question
of
what
may
happen
under
one
eyes
in
particular
cases
before
that
motion
sinks
to
rest
whether
at
the
up
or
at
the
down
end
being
really
a
bribe
to
one
own
especially
great
the
interest
of
having
noted
all
the
rises
and
falls
and
of
being
able
to
compare
the
final
point
so
far
as
any
certainty
may
go
as
to
that
either
with
the
greatest
or
the
least
previous
altitudes
since
it
is
only
when
there
have
been
exaltations
which
is
what
is
not
commonest
that
our
attention
is
most
rewarded
if
the
was
to
have
operated
indeed
for
eugène
delacroix
our
next
young
admiration
though
much
more
intelligently
my
brother
than
mine
that
had
already
taken
place
and
settled
for
we
were
to
go
on
seeing
him
and
to
the
end
in
firm
possession
of
his
crown
and
to
take
even
i
think
a
harmless
pleasure
in
our
sense
of
having
from
so
far
back
been
sure
of
it
i
was
sure
of
it
i
must
properly
add
but
as
an
effect
of
my
brother
sureness
since
i
must
by
what
i
remember
have
been
as
sure
of
paul
delaroche
for
whom
the
pendulum
was
at
last
to
be
arrested
at
a
very
different
point
i
could
see
in
a
manner
for
all
the
queerness
what
meant
by
that
beauty
and
above
all
that
living
interest
in
la
barque
du
dante
where
the
queerness
according
to
him
was
perhaps
what
contributed
most
see
it
doubtless
in
particular
when
he
reproduced
the
work
at
home
from
a
memory
aided
by
a
lithograph
yet
les
enfants
thrilled
me
to
a
different
tune
and
i
could
doubt
that
the
odd
face
of
the
elder
prince
sad
and
sore
and
sick
with
his
wide
crimped
of
fair
hair
and
his
violet
legs
marked
by
the
garter
and
dangling
from
the
bed
was
a
reconstitution
of
history
of
the
subtlest
and
most
last
word
modern
or
psychologic
kind
i
had
never
heard
of
psychology
in
art
or
anywhere
else
scarcely
anyone
then
had
but
i
truly
felt
the
nameless
force
at
play
thus
if
i
also
in
my
way
subtly
admired
one
noted
practice
of
that
virtue
mainly
regarded
indeed
i
judge
as
a
vice
would
appear
to
have
at
the
time
i
refer
to
set
in
under
such
encouragements
once
for
all
and
i
can
surely
have
enjoyed
up
to
then
no
formal
exhibition
of
anything
as
i
at
one
of
those
seasons
enjoyed
the
commemorative
show
of
delaroche
given
soon
after
his
death
in
one
of
the
rather
bleak
salles
of
the
école
des
to
which
access
was
had
from
the
quay
was
reconstituted
history
if
one
would
in
the
scaffold
the
distracted
ladies
with
coifs
and
those
immense
hanging
sleeves
that
made
them
look
as
if
they
had
over
their
arms
in
the
block
the
headsman
the
bandaged
eyes
and
groping
hands
of
lady
jane
grey
not
less
than
in
the
noble
indifference
of
charles
the
first
compromised
king
but
perfect
gentleman
at
his
inscrutable
ease
in
his
chair
and
as
if
on
his
throne
while
the
puritan
soldiers
insult
and
badger
him
the
thrill
of
which
was
all
the
greater
from
its
pertaining
to
that
english
lore
which
the
good
robert
thompson
had
to
my
responsive
delight
rubbed
into
us
more
than
anything
else
and
all
from
a
fine
old
conservative
and
monarchical
point
of
view
yet
of
these
things
attempted
no
reproduction
though
i
remember
his
repeatedly
laying
his
hand
on
delacroix
whom
he
found
always
and
everywhere
interesting
to
the
point
of
trying
effects
with
charcoal
and
crayon
in
his
manner
and
not
less
in
the
manner
of
decamps
whom
we
regarded
as
more
or
less
of
a
genius
of
the
same
rare
family
they
were
touched
with
the
ineffable
the
inscrutable
and
delacroix
in
especial
with
the
incalculable
categories
these
toward
which
we
had
even
then
by
a
happy
transition
begun
to
yearn
and
languish
we
were
not
yet
aware
of
style
though
on
the
way
to
become
so
but
were
aware
of
mystery
which
indeed
was
one
of
its
forms
while
we
saw
all
the
others
without
exception
exhibited
at
the
louvre
where
at
first
they
simply
overwhelmed
and
bewildered
me
it
was
as
if
they
had
gathered
there
into
a
vast
deafening
chorus
i
shall
never
forget
how
speaking
that
is
for
my
own
sense
they
filled
those
vast
halls
with
the
influence
rather
of
some
complicated
sound
diffused
and
reverberant
than
of
such
visibilities
as
one
could
directly
deal
with
to
distinguish
among
these
in
the
charged
and
coloured
and
confounding
air
was
difficult
it
discouraged
and
defied
which
was
doubtless
why
my
impression
originally
best
entertained
was
that
of
those
magnificent
parts
of
the
great
gallery
simply
not
inviting
us
to
distinguish
they
only
arched
over
us
in
the
wonder
of
their
endless
golden
riot
and
relief
figured
and
flourished
in
perpetual
revolution
breaking
into
great
circles
and
symmetries
of
squandered
picture
opening
into
deep
outward
embrasures
that
threw
off
the
rest
of
monumental
paris
somehow
as
a
told
story
a
sort
of
wrought
effect
or
bold
ambiguity
for
a
vista
and
yet
held
it
there
at
every
point
as
a
vast
bright
gage
even
at
moments
a
felt
adventure
of
experience
this
comes
to
saying
that
in
those
beginnings
i
felt
myself
most
happily
cross
that
bridge
over
to
style
constituted
by
the
wondrous
galerie
drawn
out
for
me
as
a
long
but
assured
initiation
and
seeming
to
form
with
its
supreme
coved
ceiling
and
inordinately
shining
parquet
a
prodigious
tube
or
tunnel
through
which
i
inhaled
little
by
little
that
is
again
and
again
a
general
sense
of
the
glory
meant
ever
so
many
things
at
once
not
only
beauty
and
art
and
supreme
design
but
history
and
fame
and
power
the
world
in
fine
raised
to
the
richest
and
noblest
expression
the
world
there
was
at
the
same
time
by
an
odd
extension
or
intensification
the
local
present
fact
to
my
small
imagination
of
the
second
empire
which
was
for
my
notified
consciousness
new
and
queer
and
perhaps
even
wrong
but
on
the
spot
so
amply
radiant
and
elegant
that
it
took
to
itself
took
under
its
protection
with
a
splendour
of
insolence
the
state
and
ancientry
of
the
whole
scene
profiting
thus
to
one
dim
historic
vision
confusedly
though
it
might
be
by
the
unparalleled
luxury
and
variety
of
its
heritage
but
who
shall
count
the
sources
at
which
an
intense
young
fancy
when
a
young
fancy
intense
capriciously
absurdly
drinks
so
that
the
effect
is
in
twenty
connections
that
of
a
or
which
fixes
for
the
senses
their
supreme
symbol
of
the
fair
or
the
strange
the
galerie
became
for
years
what
i
can
only
term
a
splendid
scene
of
things
even
of
the
quite
irrelevant
or
as
might
be
almost
unworthy
and
i
recall
to
this
hour
with
the
last
vividness
what
a
precious
part
it
played
for
me
and
exactly
by
that
continuity
of
honour
on
my
awaking
in
a
summer
dawn
many
years
later
to
the
fortunate
the
instantaneous
recovery
and
capture
of
the
most
appalling
yet
most
admirable
nightmare
of
my
life
the
climax
of
this
extraordinary
experience
which
stands
alone
for
me
as
a
founded
in
the
deepest
quickest
clearest
act
of
cogitation
and
comparison
act
indeed
of
energy
as
well
as
in
unutterable
fear
was
the
sudden
pursuit
through
an
open
door
along
a
huge
high
saloon
of
a
just
figure
that
retreated
in
terror
before
my
rush
and
dash
a
glare
of
inspired
reaction
from
irresistible
but
shameful
dread
out
of
the
room
i
had
a
moment
before
been
desperately
and
all
the
more
abjectly
defending
by
the
push
of
my
shoulder
against
hard
pressure
on
lock
and
bar
from
the
other
side
the
lucidity
not
to
say
the
sublimity
of
the
crisis
had
consisted
of
the
great
thought
that
i
in
my
appalled
state
was
probably
still
more
appalling
than
the
awful
agent
creature
or
presence
whatever
he
was
whom
i
had
guessed
in
the
suddenest
wild
start
from
sleep
the
sleep
within
my
sleep
to
be
making
for
my
place
of
rest
the
triumph
of
my
impulse
perceived
in
a
flash
as
i
acted
on
it
by
myself
at
a
bound
forcing
the
door
outward
was
the
grand
thing
but
the
great
point
of
the
whole
was
the
wonder
of
my
final
recognition
routed
dismayed
the
tables
turned
upon
him
by
my
so
surpassing
him
for
straight
aggression
and
dire
intention
my
visitant
was
already
but
a
diminished
spot
in
the
long
perspective
the
tremendous
glorious
hall
as
i
say
over
the
floor
of
which
cleared
for
the
occasion
of
its
great
line
of
priceless
vitrines
down
the
middle
he
sped
for
life
while
a
great
storm
of
thunder
and
lightning
played
through
the
deep
embrasures
of
high
windows
at
the
right
the
lightning
that
revealed
the
retreat
revealed
also
the
wondrous
place
and
by
the
same
amazing
play
my
young
imaginative
life
in
it
of
long
before
the
sense
of
which
deep
within
me
had
kept
it
whole
preserved
it
to
this
thrilling
use
for
what
in
the
world
were
the
deep
embrasures
and
the
so
polished
floor
but
those
of
the
galerie
of
my
childhood
the
scene
of
something
i
had
vaguely
then
felt
it
well
i
might
since
it
was
to
be
the
scene
of
that
immense
hallucination
of
what
at
the
same
time
in
those
years
were
the
great
rooms
of
the
louvre
almost
equally
above
and
below
not
the
scene
from
the
moment
they
so
wrought
stage
by
stage
upon
our
perceptions
literally
on
almost
all
of
these
in
one
way
and
another
quite
in
such
a
manner
i
more
and
more
see
as
to
have
been
educative
formative
fertilising
in
a
degree
which
no
other
intellectual
experience
our
youth
was
to
know
could
pretend
as
a
comprehensive
conducive
thing
to
rival
the
sharp
and
strange
the
quite
little
prevision
had
come
to
me
for
myself
i
make
out
on
the
occasion
of
our
very
first
visit
of
all
my
brother
and
mine
under
conduct
of
the
good
jean
nadali
trustfully
deputed
by
our
parents
in
the
rue
de
la
paix
on
the
morrow
of
our
first
arrival
in
paris
july
and
while
they
were
otherwise
concerned
i
hang
again
appalled
but
uplifted
on
brave
nadali
arm
his
professional
acquaintance
with
the
splendours
about
us
added
for
me
on
the
spot
to
the
charm
of
his
european
character
i
cling
to
him
while
i
gape
at
géricault
radeau
de
la
méduse
sensation
for
splendour
and
terror
of
interest
of
that
juncture
to
me
and
ever
afterwards
to
be
associated
along
with
two
or
three
other
more
or
less
contemporary
products
guérin
burial
of
atala
prudhon
cupid
and
psyche
david
helmetted
romanisms
madame
ravishing
portrait
of
herself
and
her
little
girl
with
how
can
i
say
what
foretaste
as
determined
by
that
instant
as
if
the
hour
had
struck
from
a
clock
of
all
the
fun
confusedly
speaking
that
one
was
going
to
have
and
the
kind
of
life
always
of
the
queer
inward
sort
tremendously
sporting
in
its
way
though
that
description
did
then
wait
upon
it
that
one
was
going
to
lead
it
came
of
itself
this
almost
awful
apprehension
in
all
the
presences
under
our
courier
protection
and
in
my
brother
company
it
came
just
there
and
so
there
was
alarm
in
it
somehow
as
well
as
bliss
the
bliss
in
fact
i
think
scarce
disengaged
itself
at
all
but
only
the
sense
of
a
freedom
of
contact
and
appreciation
really
too
big
for
one
and
leaving
such
a
mark
on
the
very
place
the
pictures
the
frames
themselves
the
figures
within
them
the
particular
parts
and
features
of
each
the
look
of
the
rich
light
the
smell
of
the
massively
enclosed
air
that
i
have
never
since
renewed
the
old
exposure
without
renewing
again
the
old
emotion
and
taking
up
the
small
scared
consciousness
with
so
many
of
the
conditions
repeated
is
the
charm
to
feel
afresh
the
beginning
of
so
much
that
was
to
be
the
beginning
in
short
was
with
géricault
and
david
but
it
went
on
and
on
and
slowly
spread
so
that
one
stretched
one
even
strained
perceptions
discoveries
and
extensions
piece
by
piece
come
back
on
the
great
premises
almost
as
so
many
explorations
of
the
house
of
life
so
many
circlings
and
hoverings
round
the
image
of
the
world
i
have
dim
reminiscences
of
permitted
independent
visits
uncorrectedly
juvenile
though
i
might
still
be
during
which
the
house
of
life
and
the
palace
of
art
became
so
mixed
and
interchangeable
the
louvre
being
under
a
general
description
the
most
peopled
of
all
scenes
not
less
than
the
most
hushed
of
all
temples
that
an
excursion
to
look
at
pictures
would
have
but
half
expressed
my
afternoon
i
had
looked
at
pictures
looked
and
looked
again
at
the
vast
veronese
at
murillo
madonna
at
leonardo
almost
unholy
dame
with
the
folded
hands
treasures
of
the
salon
carré
as
that
display
was
then
composed
but
i
had
also
looked
at
france
and
looked
at
europe
looked
even
at
america
as
europe
itself
might
be
conceived
so
to
look
looked
at
history
as
a
past
and
a
complacently
personal
future
at
society
manners
types
characters
possibilities
and
prodigies
and
mysteries
of
fifty
sorts
and
all
in
the
light
of
being
splendidly
on
my
own
as
i
supposed
it
though
we
had
then
that
perfection
of
slang
and
of
in
especial
going
and
coming
along
that
interminable
and
incomparable
front
of
the
palace
against
which
young
sensibility
felt
itself
almost
rub
for
endearment
and
consecration
as
a
cat
invokes
the
friction
of
a
protective
piece
of
furniture
such
were
at
any
rate
some
of
the
vague
processes
i
see
for
how
utterly
vague
they
must
show
of
picking
up
an
education
and
i
was
in
spite
of
the
vagueness
so
far
from
agreeing
with
my
brother
afterwards
that
we
did
pick
one
up
and
that
that
never
done
in
any
sense
not
negligible
and
also
that
an
education
might
or
should
in
particular
have
picked
up
and
yet
did
i
was
so
far
dissentient
i
say
that
i
think
i
quite
came
to
glorify
such
passages
and
see
them
as
part
of
an
order
really
fortunate
if
we
had
been
little
asses
i
seem
to
have
reasoned
a
higher
intention
driving
us
would
have
made
us
less
so
to
any
point
worth
mentioning
and
as
we
extracted
such
impressions
to
put
it
at
the
worst
from
redemptive
accidents
to
call
louvres
and
luxembourgs
nothing
better
why
we
were
little
asses
but
something
wholly
other
which
appeared
all
i
needed
to
contend
for
above
all
it
would
have
been
stupid
and
ignoble
an
attested
and
lasting
dishonour
not
with
our
chance
to
have
followed
our
straggling
clues
as
many
as
we
could
and
disengaging
as
we
happily
did
i
felt
the
gold
and
the
silver
ones
whatever
the
others
might
have
been
not
to
have
followed
them
and
not
to
have
arrived
by
them
so
far
as
we
were
to
arrive
instinctively
for
any
dim
designs
we
might
have
nourished
we
picked
out
the
silver
and
the
gold
attenuated
threads
though
they
must
have
been
and
i
positively
feel
that
there
were
more
of
these
far
more
casually
interwoven
than
will
reward
any
present
patience
for
my
unravelling
of
the
too
fine
tissue
xxvi
i
allude
of
course
in
particular
here
to
the
æsthetic
clue
in
general
with
which
it
was
that
we
most
or
that
i
at
any
rate
most
fumbled
without
our
in
the
least
having
then
as
i
have
already
noted
any
such
rare
name
for
it
there
were
sides
on
which
it
fairly
dangled
about
us
involving
our
small
steps
and
wits
though
others
too
where
i
could
for
my
own
part
but
clutch
at
it
in
the
void
our
experience
of
the
theatre
for
instance
which
had
played
such
a
part
for
us
at
home
almost
wholly
dropped
in
just
the
most
propitious
air
an
anomaly
indeed
half
explained
by
the
fact
that
life
in
general
all
round
us
was
perceptibly
more
theatrical
and
there
were
other
reasons
whether
definitely
set
before
us
or
not
which
we
grasped
in
proportion
as
we
gathered
by
depressing
hearsay
that
the
french
drama
great
strange
and
important
was
as
much
out
of
relation
to
our
time
of
life
our
so
little
native
strain
and
our
cultivated
innocence
as
the
american
and
english
had
been
directly
addressed
to
them
to
the
cirque
the
cirque
the
théâtre
du
cirque
we
were
on
occasion
conducted
we
had
fallen
so
to
the
level
of
circuses
and
that
name
appeared
a
safety
in
addition
to
which
the
big
theatre
most
bravely
bearing
it
the
especial
home
at
that
time
of
the
glittering
and
multitudinous
did
seem
to
lift
the
whole
scenic
possibility
for
our
eyes
into
a
higher
sphere
of
light
and
grace
than
any
previously
disclosed
i
recall
le
diable
as
in
particular
a
radiant
revelation
kept
before
us
a
whole
long
evening
and
as
an
almost
blinding
glare
which
was
quite
right
for
the
the
gradual
shrinkage
of
the
shining
one
the
hugely
inflated
at
first
to
all
the
successive
degrees
of
loose
bagginess
as
he
leads
the
reckless
young
man
he
has
originally
contracted
with
from
dazzling
pleasure
to
pleasure
till
at
last
he
is
a
mere
shrivelled
silver
string
such
as
you
could
almost
draw
through
a
keyhole
that
was
the
striking
moral
for
the
young
man
however
regaled
had
been
somehow
sold
which
had
in
the
least
been
who
had
had
all
his
pleasures
and
none
of
his
penalty
whatever
this
was
to
be
i
was
to
repine
a
little
in
these
connections
at
a
much
later
time
on
reflecting
that
had
we
only
been
taken
in
the
paris
of
that
period
as
we
had
been
taken
in
new
york
we
might
have
come
in
for
celebrities
supremely
fine
perhaps
supremely
rank
flowers
of
the
histrionic
temperament
springing
as
they
did
from
the
soil
of
the
richest
romanticism
and
adding
to
its
richness
who
practised
that
braver
art
and
finer
finish
which
a
comparatively
homogenous
public
forming
a
compact
critical
body
still
left
possible
rachel
was
alive
but
dying
the
memory
of
mademoiselle
mars
at
her
latest
was
still
in
the
air
mademoiselle
georges
a
massive
a
monstrous
antique
had
withal
returned
for
a
season
to
the
stage
but
we
missed
her
as
we
missed
déjazet
and
frédéric
lemâitre
and
mélingue
and
samson
to
say
nothing
of
others
of
the
age
before
the
flood
taking
for
the
flood
that
actual
high
tide
of
the
outer
barbarian
presence
the
general
alien
and
polyglot
in
stalls
and
boxes
which
i
remember
to
have
heard
gustave
flaubert
lament
as
the
ruin
of
the
theatre
through
the
assumption
of
judgeship
by
a
bench
to
whom
the
very
values
of
the
speech
of
author
and
actor
were
virtually
closed
or
at
the
best
uncertain
i
enjoyed
but
two
snatches
of
the
older
representational
art
no
particular
of
either
of
which
however
has
faded
from
me
the
earlier
and
rarer
of
these
an
evening
at
the
gymnase
for
a
with
mesdames
rose
chéri
mélanie
delaporte
and
victoria
afterwards
i
squeeze
again
with
my
mother
my
aunt
and
my
brother
into
the
stuffy
baignoire
and
i
take
to
my
memory
in
especial
madame
de
girardin
une
femme
qui
déteste
son
mari
the
thrilling
story
as
i
judged
it
of
an
admirable
lady
who
to
save
her
loyalist
husband
during
the
revolution
feigns
the
most
jacobin
opinions
represents
herself
a
citoyenne
of
citoyennes
in
order
to
keep
him
the
more
safely
concealed
in
her
house
he
flattens
himself
to
almost
greater
peril
of
life
behind
a
panel
of
the
wainscot
which
she
has
a
secret
for
opening
when
he
requires
air
and
food
and
they
may
for
a
fearful
fleeting
instant
be
alone
together
and
the
point
of
the
picture
is
in
the
contrast
between
these
melting
moments
and
the
under
the
tremendous
strain
of
receiving
on
the
one
side
the
invading
investigating
terrorist
commissaries
sharply
suspicious
but
successfully
baffled
and
on
the
other
her
noble
relatives
her
husband
mother
and
sister
if
i
rightly
remember
who
are
not
in
the
secret
and
whom
for
perfect
prudence
she
keeps
out
of
it
though
alone
with
her
and
themselves
in
hourly
danger
they
might
be
trusted
and
who
believing
him
concealed
elsewhere
and
terribly
tracked
treat
her
in
her
republican
rage
as
lost
to
all
honour
and
all
duty
one
sense
of
such
things
after
so
long
a
time
has
of
course
scant
authority
for
others
but
i
myself
trust
my
vision
of
rose
chéri
fine
play
just
as
i
trust
that
of
her
her
at
first
extremely
odd
and
positively
osseous
appearance
an
emaciated
woman
with
a
high
bulging
forehead
somewhat
of
the
form
of
rachel
for
whom
the
triumphs
of
produced
illusion
as
in
the
second
third
and
fourth
great
dramas
of
the
younger
dumas
had
to
be
triumphs
indeed
my
one
other
reminiscence
of
this
order
connects
itself
and
quite
three
years
later
with
the
old
dingy
vaudeville
of
the
place
de
la
bourse
where
i
saw
in
my
company
a
rhymed
domestic
drama
of
the
then
still
admired
ponsard
ce
qui
plaît
aux
femmes
a
piece
that
enjoyed
i
believe
scant
success
but
that
was
to
leave
with
me
ineffaceable
images
how
was
it
possible
i
wondered
to
have
more
grace
and
talent
a
rarer
cooler
art
than
mademoiselle
fargeuil
the
heroine
the
fine
lady
whom
a
pair
of
rival
lovers
seeking
to
win
her
hand
by
offering
her
what
will
most
please
her
treat
in
the
one
case
to
a
brilliant
fête
a
little
play
within
a
play
at
which
we
assist
and
in
the
other
to
the
inside
view
of
an
attic
of
misery
into
which
the
more
cunning
suitor
introduces
her
just
in
time
to
save
a
poor
girl
the
tenant
of
the
place
from
being
ruinously
that
is
successfully
tempted
by
a
terrible
old
woman
a
prowling
who
dangles
before
her
the
condition
on
which
so
pretty
a
person
may
enjoy
every
comfort
her
happier
sister
the
courted
young
widow
intervenes
in
time
reinforces
her
tottering
virtue
opens
for
her
an
account
with
baker
and
butcher
and
doubting
no
longer
which
flame
is
to
be
crowned
charmingly
shows
us
that
what
pleases
women
most
is
the
exercise
of
charity
then
it
was
i
first
beheld
that
extraordinary
veteran
of
the
stage
mademoiselle
pierson
almost
immemorially
attached
for
later
generations
to
the
théâtre
français
the
span
of
whose
career
thus
strikes
me
as
fabulous
though
she
figured
as
a
very
juvenile
beauty
in
the
small
or
allegory
forming
ponsard
second
act
she
has
been
playing
mothers
and
aunts
this
many
and
many
a
year
and
still
indeed
much
as
a
juvenile
beauty
not
that
light
circumstance
however
pleads
for
commemoration
nor
yet
the
further
fact
that
i
was
to
admire
mademoiselle
fargeuil
in
the
the
time
after
she
had
given
all
sardou
earlier
successes
the
help
of
her
shining
firmness
when
she
had
passed
from
interesting
comedy
and
even
from
romantic
drama
not
less
perhaps
still
more
interesting
with
sardou
patrie
as
a
bridge
to
the
use
of
the
bigger
brush
of
the
ambigu
and
other
homes
of
melodrama
the
sense
such
as
it
is
that
i
extract
from
the
pair
of
modest
memories
in
question
is
rather
their
value
as
a
glimpse
of
the
old
order
that
spoke
so
much
less
of
our
hundred
modern
material
resources
matters
the
stage
of
appears
mainly
to
live
by
and
such
volumes
more
of
the
one
thing
that
was
then
and
that
given
various
other
things
had
to
be
of
the
essence
that
one
thing
was
the
quality
to
say
nothing
of
the
quantity
of
the
actor
personal
resource
technical
history
tested
temper
proved
experience
on
which
almost
everything
had
to
depend
and
the
thought
of
which
makes
the
mere
starved
scene
and
medium
of
the
period
the
of
the
picture
a
more
confessed
and
more
heroic
they
have
been
more
and
more
eased
off
the
scene
and
medium
for
our
couple
of
generations
so
much
so
in
fact
that
the
rest
of
the
picture
has
become
almost
the
picture
the
author
and
the
producer
among
us
lift
the
weight
of
the
play
from
the
performer
particularly
of
the
play
dealing
with
our
immediate
life
and
manners
and
aspects
after
a
fashion
which
does
half
the
work
thus
reducing
the
personal
equation
the
demand
for
the
maximum
of
individual
doing
to
a
contribution
mostly
of
the
loosest
and
sparest
as
a
sop
to
historic
curiosity
at
all
events
may
even
so
short
an
impression
serve
impression
of
the
strenuous
age
and
its
fine
old
masterful
of
its
victims
who
were
not
the
expert
spectators
the
spectators
were
so
expert
so
broken
in
to
material
suffering
for
the
sake
of
their
passion
that
as
the
suffering
was
only
material
they
found
the
æsthetic
reward
the
critical
relish
of
the
essence
all
adequate
a
fact
that
seems
in
a
sort
to
point
a
moral
of
large
application
everything
but
the
interpretation
the
personal
in
the
french
theatre
of
those
days
had
kinds
and
degrees
of
weakness
and
futility
say
even
falsity
of
which
our
modern
habit
is
wholly
impatient
let
alone
other
conditions
still
that
were
detestable
even
at
the
time
and
some
of
which
forms
of
discomfort
and
annoyance
linger
on
to
this
day
the
playhouse
in
short
was
almost
a
place
of
physical
torture
and
it
is
still
rarely
in
paris
a
place
of
physical
ease
add
to
this
the
old
thinness
of
the
school
of
scribe
and
the
old
emptiness
of
the
thousand
vaudevillistes
which
part
of
the
exhibition
till
modern
comedy
began
under
the
younger
dumas
and
augier
had
for
its
counterpart
but
the
terrible
dead
weight
or
at
least
the
prodigious
prolixity
and
absurdity
of
much
not
to
say
of
most
of
the
romantic
and
melodramatic
output
it
apparently
in
the
golden
age
of
acting
to
sit
through
interminable
evenings
in
impossible
places
since
to
assume
that
the
age
in
that
particular
respect
golden
for
which
we
have
in
fact
a
good
deal
of
evidence
alone
explains
the
patience
of
the
public
with
the
public
the
were
according
to
their
seasoned
strength
almost
exclusively
appointed
to
deal
just
as
in
the
conditions
most
familiar
to
ourselves
this
charge
is
laid
on
almost
everyone
concerned
in
the
case
save
the
representatives
of
the
parts
and
far
more
other
people
are
now
concerned
than
of
old
not
least
those
who
have
learned
to
make
the
playhouse
endurable
all
of
which
leaves
us
with
this
interesting
vision
of
a
possibly
great
truth
the
truth
that
you
ca
have
more
than
one
kind
of
intensity
intensity
worthy
of
the
name
at
once
the
intensity
of
the
golden
age
of
the
histrion
was
the
intensity
of
good
faith
the
intensity
of
our
period
is
that
of
the
producer
and
machinist
to
which
add
even
that
of
architect
author
and
critic
between
which
derivative
kind
of
that
article
as
we
may
call
it
and
the
other
the
immediate
kind
it
would
appear
that
you
have
absolutely
to
choose
xxvii
i
see
much
of
the
rest
of
that
particular
paris
time
in
the
light
of
the
institution
fezandié
and
i
see
the
institution
fezandié
rue
balzac
in
the
light
if
not
quite
of
alphonse
daudet
lean
asylum
for
the
pays
of
which
i
have
felt
the
previous
institutions
of
new
york
sketchily
remind
me
at
least
in
that
of
certain
other
of
his
studies
in
that
field
of
the
precarious
the
ambiguous
paris
over
parts
of
which
the
great
arch
at
the
top
of
the
flings
at
its
hours
by
its
wide
protective
plausible
shadow
a
precious
mantle
of
tone
they
gather
these
chequered
parts
into
its
vast
paternal
presence
and
enjoy
at
its
expense
a
degree
of
reflected
dignity
it
was
to
the
big
square
villa
of
the
rue
balzac
that
we
turned
as
pupils
not
unacquainted
with
vicissitudes
from
a
scene
swept
bare
of
lerambert
an
establishment
that
strikes
me
at
this
distance
of
time
as
of
the
oddest
and
most
indescribable
or
as
describable
at
best
in
some
of
the
finer
turns
and
touches
of
daudet
best
method
the
picture
indeed
should
not
be
invidious
it
so
little
needs
that
i
feel
for
its
due
measure
of
the
vivid
the
queer
the
droll
all
coming
back
to
me
without
prejudice
to
its
air
as
of
an
equally
futile
felicity
i
see
it
as
bright
and
loose
and
vague
as
confused
and
embarrassed
and
helpless
i
see
it
i
fear
as
quite
ridiculous
but
as
wholly
harmless
to
my
brothers
and
me
at
least
and
as
having
left
us
with
a
fund
of
human
impressions
it
played
before
us
such
a
variety
of
figure
and
character
and
so
relieved
us
of
a
sense
of
untoward
discipline
or
of
the
pursuit
of
abstract
knowledge
it
was
a
recreational
or
at
least
a
social
rather
than
a
tuitional
house
which
fact
had
i
really
believe
weighed
favourably
with
our
parents
when
bereft
of
lerambert
they
asked
themselves
with
their
considerable
practice
how
next
to
bestow
us
our
father
like
so
many
free
spirits
of
that
time
in
new
york
and
boston
had
been
much
interested
in
the
writings
of
charles
fourier
and
in
his
scheme
of
the
phalanstery
as
the
solution
of
human
troubles
and
it
comes
to
me
that
he
must
have
met
or
in
other
words
heard
of
fezandié
as
an
active
and
sympathetic
i
think
there
were
only
by
that
time
who
was
embarking
not
far
from
us
on
an
experiment
if
not
absolutely
phalansteric
at
least
inspired
or
at
any
rate
enriched
by
a
bold
idealism
i
like
to
think
of
the
institution
as
all
but
phalansteric
it
so
corrects
any
fear
that
such
places
might
be
dreary
i
recall
this
one
as
positively
gay
bristling
and
bustling
and
resonant
untouched
by
the
strenuous
note
for
instance
of
blithedale
i
like
to
think
that
in
its
then
still
almost
suburban
its
pleasantly
heterogeneous
quarter
now
oppressively
uniform
it
was
close
to
where
balzac
had
ended
his
life
though
i
question
its
identity
as
for
a
while
i
tried
not
to
with
the
scene
itself
of
the
great
man
catastrophe
round
its
garden
at
all
events
he
would
have
come
and
gone
a
throb
of
inference
that
had
for
some
years
indeed
to
be
postponed
for
me
though
an
association
displacing
over
the
whole
spot
every
other
interest
i
in
any
case
ca
pretend
not
to
have
been
most
appealed
to
by
that
especial
phase
of
our
education
from
which
the
pedagogic
process
as
commonly
understood
was
most
fantastically
absent
it
excelled
in
this
respect
the
fezandié
phase
even
others
exceptionally
appointed
heaven
knows
for
the
supremacy
and
yet
its
glory
is
that
it
was
no
poor
blank
but
that
it
fairly
creaked
and
groaned
heatedly
overflowed
with
its
wealth
we
were
the
three
of
us
but
we
remained
in
general
to
luncheon
coming
home
then
late
in
the
afternoon
with
an
almost
sore
experience
of
multiplicity
and
vivacity
of
contact
for
the
beauty
of
it
all
was
that
the
institution
was
speaking
technically
not
more
a
with
prevailingly
english
and
american
pupils
than
a
with
mature
beneficiaries
of
both
sexes
and
that
our
two
categories
were
shaken
up
together
to
the
liveliest
effect
this
had
been
fezandié
grand
conception
a
son
of
the
south
bald
and
slightly
replete
with
a
delicate
beard
a
quick
but
anxious
rather
melancholy
eye
and
a
slim
graceful
juvenile
wife
who
multiplied
herself
though
scarce
knowing
at
moments
i
think
where
or
how
to
turn
i
see
him
as
a
daudet
but
of
the
sensitive
not
the
sensual
type
as
something
of
a
rolling
stone
rolling
rather
down
hill
he
had
enjoyed
some
arrested
possibly
blighted
connection
in
america
and
as
ready
always
again
for
some
new
application
of
faith
and
funds
if
fondly
failing
in
the
least
to
see
why
the
particular
application
in
the
rue
balzac
the
body
of
pensioners
ranging
from
infancy
to
hoary
eld
should
have
been
a
bright
success
could
have
made
it
one
it
would
have
been
a
most
original
triumph
i
recover
it
as
for
ourselves
a
beautifully
mixed
adventure
a
brave
little
seeing
of
the
world
on
the
happy
pretext
of
lessons
we
lessons
from
time
to
time
but
had
them
in
company
with
ladies
and
gentlemen
young
men
and
young
women
of
the
family
who
sat
at
long
boards
of
green
cloth
with
us
and
with
several
of
our
contemporaries
english
and
american
boys
taking
from
the
head
of
the
house
himself
or
from
the
aged
and
most
remarkable
bonnefons
whom
we
believed
to
have
been
a
superannuated
actor
he
above
all
such
a
model
for
daudet
and
who
interrupted
our
abashed
readings
aloud
to
him
of
the
french
classics
older
and
newer
by
wondrous
reminiscences
and
even
imitations
of
talma
he
moved
among
us
in
a
cloud
of
legend
the
wigged
and
wrinkled
the
impassioned
though
i
think
alas
underfed
bonnefons
it
was
our
belief
that
he
went
back
beyond
the
first
empire
to
the
scenes
of
the
revolution
this
perhaps
partly
by
reason
in
the
first
place
of
his
scorn
of
our
pronunciation
when
we
met
it
of
the
sovereign
word
the
poverty
of
which
our
deplorable
libbeté
without
r
he
mimicked
and
derided
sounding
the
right
the
revolutionary
form
out
splendidly
with
thirty
r
the
prolonged
beat
of
a
drum
and
then
we
believed
him
if
artistically
conservative
politically
obnoxious
to
the
powers
that
then
were
though
knowing
that
those
so
marked
had
to
walk
and
even
to
breathe
cautiously
for
fear
of
the
of
the
tyrant
we
knew
all
about
mouchards
and
talked
of
them
as
we
do
of
aviators
or
suffragettes
to
remember
which
in
an
age
so
candidly
unconscious
of
them
is
to
feel
how
much
history
we
have
seen
unrolled
there
were
times
when
he
but
paced
up
and
down
and
round
the
long
table
i
see
him
as
never
seated
but
always
on
the
move
a
weary
wandering
jew
of
the
but
in
particular
i
hear
him
recite
to
us
the
combat
with
the
moors
from
le
cid
and
show
us
how
talma
describing
it
seemed
to
crouch
down
on
his
haunches
in
order
to
spring
up
again
terrifically
to
the
height
of
nous
nous
levons
alors
which
bonnefons
rendered
as
if
on
the
carpet
there
fifty
men
at
least
had
leaped
to
their
feet
but
he
threw
off
these
broken
lights
with
a
quick
relapse
to
indifference
he
did
like
the
of
the
children
of
albion
at
least
his
view
was
low
on
his
american
specimens
he
had
i
observed
more
mercy
and
this
imperfection
of
sympathy
the
question
of
waterloo
apart
rested
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
on
his
so
resenting
the
dishonour
suffered
at
our
hands
by
his
beautiful
tongue
to
which
as
the
great
field
of
elocution
he
was
patriotically
devoted
i
think
he
fairly
loathed
our
closed
english
vowels
and
confused
consonants
our
destitution
of
sounds
that
he
recognised
as
sounds
though
why
in
this
connection
he
put
up
best
with
our
own
compatriots
embroiled
at
that
time
often
in
even
stranger
vocables
than
now
is
more
than
i
can
say
i
think
that
would
be
explained
perhaps
by
his
feeling
in
them
as
an
old
equalitarian
certain
accessibilities
besides
we
of
the
younger
persuasion
at
least
must
have
done
his
ear
less
violence
than
those
earnest
ladies
from
beyond
the
sea
and
than
those
young
englishmen
qualifying
for
examinations
and
careers
who
flocked
with
us
both
to
the
plausibly
spread
and
the
severely
disgarnished
table
and
on
whose
part
i
seem
to
see
it
again
an
effort
of
anguish
to
pick
up
the
happy
idiom
that
we
had
unconsciously
acquired
french
in
the
fine
old
formula
of
those
days
so
much
diffused
was
the
language
of
the
family
but
i
think
it
must
have
appeared
to
these
students
in
general
a
family
of
which
the
youngest
members
were
but
scantly
kept
in
their
place
we
piped
with
a
greater
facility
and
to
a
richer
meed
of
recognition
which
sounds
as
if
we
might
have
become
in
these
strange
collocations
fairly
offensive
little
prigs
that
was
none
the
less
not
the
case
for
there
were
oddly
enough
a
few
french
boys
as
well
to
whom
on
the
lingual
or
the
family
ground
we
felt
ourselves
feebly
relative
and
in
comparison
with
whom
for
that
matter
or
with
one
of
whom
i
remember
an
occasion
of
my
having
to
sink
to
insignificance
there
was
at
the
institution
little
of
a
staff
besides
waiters
and
bonnes
but
it
embraced
such
as
it
was
mesnard
as
well
as
bonnefons
mesnard
of
the
new
generation
instructor
in
whatever
it
might
be
among
the
arts
that
did
consist
of
our
rolling
our
r
and
with
them
to
help
us
out
more
or
less
our
eyes
it
is
significant
that
this
elegant
branch
is
now
quite
vague
to
me
and
i
recall
mesnard
in
fine
as
no
less
modern
and
cheap
than
bonnefons
was
rare
and
unappraiseable
he
had
nevertheless
given
me
his
attention
one
morning
doubtless
patiently
enough
in
some
corner
of
the
villa
that
we
had
for
the
moment
practically
to
ourselves
i
seem
to
see
a
small
empty
room
looking
on
the
garden
when
there
entered
to
us
benevolently
ushered
by
madame
fezandié
a
small
boy
of
very
fair
and
romantic
aspect
as
it
struck
me
a
pupil
newly
arrived
i
remember
of
him
mainly
that
he
had
a
sort
of
nimbus
of
light
curls
a
face
delicate
and
pale
and
that
deeply
hoarse
voice
with
which
french
children
used
to
excite
our
wonder
mesnard
asked
of
him
at
once
with
interest
his
name
and
on
his
pronouncing
it
sought
to
know
with
livelier
attention
if
he
were
then
the
son
of
arsène
houssaye
lately
director
of
the
théâtre
français
to
this
distinction
the
boy
confessed
all
to
such
intensification
of
our
répétiteur
interest
that
i
knew
myself
quite
dropped
in
comparison
from
his
scheme
of
things
such
an
origin
as
our
little
affected
him
visibly
as
dazzling
and
i
felt
justified
after
a
while
in
stealing
away
into
the
shade
the
beautiful
little
boy
was
to
live
to
be
the
late
henry
houssaye
the
shining
hellenist
and
historian
i
have
never
forgotten
the
ecstasy
of
hope
in
mesnard
question
as
a
light
on
the
reverence
then
entertained
for
the
institution
houssaye
the
elder
had
administered
xxviii
there
comes
to
me
in
spite
of
these
memories
of
an
extended
connection
a
sense
as
of
some
shrinkage
or
decline
in
the
of
the
institution
which
seems
to
have
found
its
current
run
a
bit
thick
and
troubled
rather
than
with
the
pleasant
plash
in
which
we
at
first
appeared
all
equally
to
bathe
i
gather
as
i
try
to
reconstitute
that
the
general
enterprise
simply
proved
a
fantasy
not
workable
and
that
at
any
rate
the
elders
and
often
such
queer
elders
tended
to
outnumber
the
candid
so
that
i
wonder
by
the
same
token
on
what
theory
of
the
castalian
spring
as
taught
there
to
trickle
if
not
to
flow
houssaye
holding
his
small
son
by
the
heel
as
it
were
may
have
been
moved
to
dip
him
into
our
well
shall
i
blush
to
relate
that
my
own
impression
of
its
virtue
must
have
come
exactly
from
this
uncanny
turn
taken
and
quite
in
spite
of
the
high
fezandié
ideals
by
the
house
of
entertainment
where
the
assimilation
of
no
form
of
innocence
was
doubted
of
by
reason
of
the
forms
of
experience
that
insisted
somehow
on
cropping
up
and
no
form
of
experience
too
directly
deprecated
by
reason
of
the
originally
plotted
tender
growths
of
innocence
and
some
of
these
shapes
were
precisely
those
from
which
our
good
principal
may
well
have
first
drawn
his
liveliest
reassurance
i
seem
to
remember
such
ancient
american
virgins
in
especial
and
such
odd
and
either
distinctively
or
more
particularly
and
chinless
compatriots
in
black
of
no
type
or
cut
no
suggested
application
at
all
as
garments
application
that
is
to
anything
in
the
nature
of
character
or
circumstance
function
or
position
gathered
about
in
the
groups
that
bonnefons
almost
terrorised
by
his
refusal
to
recognise
among
the
barbarous
races
any
approach
to
his
view
of
the
great
principle
of
diction
i
remember
deeply
and
privately
enjoying
some
of
his
shades
of
scorn
and
seeing
how
given
his
own
background
they
were
thoroughly
founded
i
remember
above
all
as
burnt
in
by
the
impression
he
gave
me
of
the
creature
animated
and
containing
no
waste
expressional
spaces
no
imaginative
flatnesses
the
notion
of
the
luxury
of
life
though
indeed
of
the
amount
of
trouble
of
it
too
when
of
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
of
sensibility
might
be
dropped
involved
in
being
a
frenchman
the
liveliest
lesson
i
must
have
drawn
however
from
that
source
makes
in
any
case
at
the
best
an
odd
educational
connection
given
the
kind
of
concentration
at
which
education
even
such
as
ours
is
supposed
especially
to
aim
i
speak
of
that
direct
promiscuity
of
insights
which
might
easily
have
been
pronounced
profitless
with
their
attendant
impressions
and
quickened
sensibilities
yielding
as
these
last
did
harvests
of
apparitions
i
positively
cherish
at
the
present
hour
the
fond
fancy
that
we
all
soaked
in
some
such
sublime
element
as
might
still
have
hung
about
there
i
mean
on
the
very
spot
from
the
vital
presence
so
lately
extinct
of
the
prodigious
balzac
which
had
involved
as
by
its
mere
respiration
so
dense
a
cloud
of
other
presences
so
arrayed
an
army
of
interrelated
shades
that
the
air
was
still
thick
as
with
the
fumes
of
witchcraft
with
infinite
seeing
and
supposing
and
creating
with
a
whole
imaginative
traffic
the
pension
vauquer
then
but
lately
existent
according
to
le
père
goriot
on
the
other
side
of
the
seine
was
still
to
be
revealed
to
me
but
the
figures
peopling
it
are
not
essentially
more
intense
that
is
as
a
matter
of
the
marked
and
featured
the
terrible
and
the
touching
as
compared
with
the
paleness
of
the
conned
page
in
general
than
i
persuade
myself
with
so
little
difficulty
that
i
found
the
more
numerous
and
more
shifting
though
properly
doubtless
less
inspiring
constituents
of
the
pension
fezandié
fantastic
and
all
subjective
that
i
should
attribute
a
part
of
their
interest
or
that
of
the
scene
spreading
round
them
to
any
competent
perception
in
the
mind
that
the
general
or
public
moment
had
a
rarity
and
a
brevity
a
sharp
intensity
of
its
own
ruffling
all
things
as
they
came
with
the
morning
breath
of
the
second
empire
and
making
them
twinkle
back
with
a
light
of
resigned
acceptance
a
freshness
of
cynicism
the
force
of
a
great
grimacing
example
the
grimace
might
have
been
legibly
there
in
the
air
to
the
young
apprehension
and
could
i
but
simplify
this
record
enough
i
should
represent
everything
as
part
of
it
i
seemed
at
any
rate
meanwhile
to
think
of
the
fezandié
young
men
young
englishmen
mostly
who
were
getting
up
their
french
in
that
air
for
what
i
supposed
in
my
candour
to
be
appointments
and
posts
diplomatic
commercial
vaguely
official
and
who
as
i
now
infer
though
i
altogether
embrace
it
at
the
time
must
under
the
loose
rule
of
the
establishment
have
been
amusing
themselves
not
a
little
it
was
as
a
of
their
free
criticism
i
take
it
that
i
felt
the
first
chill
of
an
apprehended
decline
of
the
establishment
some
pang
of
prevision
of
what
might
come
and
come
as
with
a
crash
of
the
general
fine
fallacy
on
which
it
rested
their
criticism
was
for
that
matter
free
enough
causing
me
to
admire
it
even
while
it
terrified
they
expressed
themselves
in
terms
of
magnificent
scorn
such
as
might
naturally
proceed
i
think
i
felt
from
a
mightier
race
they
spoke
of
poor
old
bonnefons
they
spoke
of
our
good
fezandié
himself
they
spoke
more
or
less
of
everyone
within
view
as
beggars
and
beasts
and
i
remember
to
have
heard
on
their
lips
no
qualification
of
any
dish
served
to
us
at
dêjeuner
and
still
more
at
the
later
meal
of
which
my
brothers
and
i
did
partake
but
as
rotten
these
were
expressions
absent
from
our
domestic
our
american
air
either
of
fonder
discriminations
or
vaguer
estimates
which
fairly
extended
for
me
the
range
of
intellectual
or
at
least
of
social
resource
and
as
the
general
tone
of
them
comes
back
to
me
it
floods
somehow
with
light
the
image
of
the
fine
old
insular
confidence
so
intellectually
unregenerate
then
that
such
a
name
scarce
covers
it
though
inward
stirrings
and
the
growth
of
a
sense
of
things
have
now
begun
unnaturally
to
agitate
and
disfigure
it
in
which
the
general
outward
concussion
of
the
english
abroad
with
the
fact
of
being
abroad
took
place
the
fezandié
young
men
were
as
much
abroad
as
might
be
and
yet
figured
to
me
largely
by
the
upsetting
force
of
that
confidence
all
but
physically
exercised
as
the
finest
handsomest
knowingest
creatures
so
that
when
i
met
them
of
an
afternoon
descending
the
with
fine
long
strides
and
in
the
costume
of
the
period
for
which
we
can
always
refer
to
contemporary
numbers
of
punch
the
fact
that
i
was
for
the
most
part
walking
sedately
either
with
my
mother
or
my
aunt
or
even
with
my
sister
and
her
governess
caused
the
spark
of
my
vision
that
they
were
armed
for
conquest
or
at
the
least
for
adventure
more
expansively
to
glow
i
am
not
sure
whether
as
a
general
thing
they
honoured
me
at
such
instants
with
a
sign
of
recognition
but
i
recover
in
especial
the
sense
of
an
evening
hour
during
which
i
had
accompanied
my
mother
to
the
hôtel
meurice
where
one
of
the
new
york
cousins
aforementioned
daughter
of
one
of
the
albany
uncles
that
is
of
the
rhinebeck
member
of
the
group
had
perched
for
a
time
so
incongruously
one
already
seemed
to
feel
after
the
sorriest
stroke
of
fate
i
see
again
the
gaslit
glare
of
the
rue
de
rivoli
in
the
spring
or
the
autumn
evening
i
forget
which
for
our
year
of
the
rue
had
been
followed
by
a
migration
to
the
rue
montaigne
with
a
period
or
rather
with
two
periods
of
interwoven
and
we
might
have
made
our
beguiled
way
from
either
domicile
and
the
whole
impression
seemed
to
hang
too
numerous
lamps
and
too
glittering
about
the
poor
pendletons
bereavement
their
loss
of
their
only
their
so
sturdily
handsome
little
boy
and
to
suffuse
their
state
with
the
warm
rich
exhalations
of
subterraneous
cookery
with
which
i
find
my
recall
of
paris
from
those
years
so
disproportionately
and
so
quite
other
than
stomachically
charged
the
point
of
all
of
which
is
simply
that
just
as
we
had
issued
from
the
hotel
my
mother
anxiously
urging
me
through
the
cross
currents
and
queer
contacts
as
it
were
of
the
great
bazaar
of
which
the
rue
de
rivoli
was
then
a
much
more
bristling
avenue
than
now
rather
than
depending
on
me
for
support
and
protection
there
swung
into
view
the
most
splendid
as
i
at
least
esteemed
him
of
my
elders
and
betters
in
the
rue
balzac
who
had
left
the
questions
there
supposedly
engaging
us
far
behind
and
with
his
high
hat
a
trifle
askew
and
his
cigar
actively
alight
revealed
to
me
at
a
glance
what
it
was
to
be
in
full
possession
of
paris
there
was
speed
in
his
step
assurance
in
his
air
he
was
visibly
impatiently
on
the
way
and
he
gave
me
thereby
my
first
full
image
of
what
it
was
exactly
to
on
the
way
he
gave
it
the
more
doubtless
through
the
fact
that
with
a
flourish
of
the
aforesaid
high
hat
from
which
the
englishman
of
that
age
was
so
singularly
inseparable
he
testified
to
the
act
of
recognition
and
to
deference
to
my
companion
but
with
a
grand
that
as
i
remember
from
childhood
the
so
frequent
effect
of
an
easy
patronage
compared
with
a
overlooking
on
the
part
of
an
admired
senior
only
gave
an
accent
to
the
difference
as
if
he
cared
or
could
have
that
i
but
went
forth
through
the
paris
night
in
the
hand
of
my
mamma
while
he
had
greeted
us
with
a
grace
that
was
as
a
beat
of
the
very
wings
of
freedom
of
such
shreds
at
any
rate
proves
to
be
woven
the
stuff
of
young
sensibility
when
memory
if
sensibility
has
at
all
existed
for
it
rummages
over
our
old
trunkful
of
spiritual
duds
and
drawing
forth
ever
so
tenderly
this
that
and
the
other
tattered
web
holds
up
the
pattern
to
the
light
i
find
myself
in
this
connection
so
restlessly
and
tenderly
rummage
that
the
tatters
however
thin
come
out
in
handsful
and
every
shred
seems
tangled
with
another
gertrude
pendleton
mere
name
for
instance
becomes
and
very
preferably
the
frame
of
another
and
a
better
picture
drawing
to
it
cognate
associations
those
of
that
element
of
the
new
york
cousinship
which
had
originally
operated
to
place
there
in
a
shining
and
even
as
it
were
an
economic
light
a
preference
for
paris
which
preference
during
the
period
of
the
rue
and
the
rue
montaigne
we
wistfully
saw
at
play
the
very
lightest
and
freest
on
the
part
of
the
inimitable
masons
their
earlier
days
of
tours
and
trouville
were
over
a
period
of
relative
rigour
at
the
florence
of
the
still
encircling
walls
the
still
so
existent
abuses
and
felicities
was
also
i
seem
to
gather
a
thing
of
the
past
great
accessions
consciously
awaited
during
the
previous
leaner
time
had
beautifully
befallen
them
and
my
own
whole
consciousness
of
the
general
air
so
insistently
i
discriminate
for
that
alone
was
coloured
by
a
familiar
view
of
their
enjoyment
of
these
on
a
tremendously
draped
and
festooned
of
the
bristling
with
ormolu
and
pradier
statuettes
and
looking
almost
straight
across
to
the
british
embassy
rather
a
low
premier
after
the
manner
of
an
entresol
as
i
remember
it
and
where
the
closed
windows
which
but
scantly
distinguished
between
our
own
sounds
and
those
of
the
sociable
and
yet
the
terrible
street
of
records
and
memories
seemed
to
maintain
an
air
and
a
light
thick
with
a
mixture
of
every
sort
of
queer
old
parisian
amenity
and
reference
as
if
to
look
or
to
listen
or
to
touch
were
somehow
at
the
same
time
to
probe
to
recover
and
communicate
to
behold
to
taste
and
even
to
smell
to
one
greater
assault
by
suggestion
no
doubt
but
also
to
the
effect
of
some
sweet
and
strange
repletion
as
from
the
continued
consumption
say
out
of
flounced
and
puckered
boxes
of
serried
rows
of
chocolate
and
other
bonbons
i
must
have
felt
the
whole
thing
as
something
for
one
developed
senses
to
live
up
to
and
make
light
of
and
have
been
rather
ashamed
of
my
own
for
just
a
little
sickishly
staggering
under
it
this
goes
however
with
the
fondest
recall
of
our
cousins
inbred
ease
from
far
back
in
all
such
assumable
relations
and
of
how
four
of
the
simplest
sweetest
girls
as
they
were
with
the
eldest
a
charming
beauty
to
settle
on
the
general
ground
after
marriage
and
widowhood
and
still
to
be
blooming
there
they
were
possessed
of
the
scene
and
its
great
reaches
and
resources
and
possibilities
in
a
degree
that
reduced
us
to
small
provincialism
and
a
hanging
on
their
lips
when
they
told
us
that
is
when
the
gentlest
of
mammas
and
the
lovely
daughter
who
was
out
did
of
presentations
at
the
tuileries
to
the
then
the
ineffable
empress
reports
touchingly
qualified
on
the
part
of
our
so
exposed
yet
after
all
so
scantily
indurated
relatives
by
the
question
of
whether
occasions
so
great
did
perhaps
nevertheless
profane
the
sundays
for
which
they
were
usually
appointed
there
was
something
of
an
implication
in
the
air
of
those
days
when
young
americans
were
more
numerously
lovely
than
now
or
at
least
more
it
would
fairly
appear
that
some
account
of
the
only
tradition
they
had
ever
been
rumoured
to
observe
that
of
the
lord
day
might
have
been
taken
even
at
the
tuileries
but
what
most
comes
back
to
me
as
the
very
note
and
fragrance
of
the
new
york
cousinship
in
this
general
connection
is
a
time
that
i
remember
to
have
glanced
at
on
a
page
distinct
from
these
when
the
particular
cousins
i
now
speak
of
had
conceived
under
the
influence
of
i
know
not
what
unextinguished
morning
star
the
liveliest
taste
for
the
earliest
possible
rambles
and
researches
in
which
they
were
so
good
as
to
allow
me
when
i
was
otherwise
allowed
to
participate
walks
of
an
extraordinarily
character
at
the
hour
of
the
meticulous
and
exceptionally
french
polishers
known
to
the
paris
dawns
of
the
second
empire
as
at
no
time
since
which
made
us
all
feel
together
under
the
conduct
of
honorine
bright
child
of
the
pavement
herself
as
if
in
our
fresh
curiosity
and
admiration
had
also
something
to
say
to
the
great
show
presently
to
be
opened
and
were
free
throughout
the
place
as
those
are
free
of
a
house
who
know
its
aspects
of
attic
and
cellar
or
how
it
looks
from
behind
i
call
our
shepherdess
honorine
even
though
perhaps
not
infallibly
naming
the
sociable
soubrette
who
might
with
all
her
gay
bold
confidence
have
been
an
official
inspectress
in
person
and
to
whose
easy
care
or
more
particularly
expert
sensibility
and
candour
of
sympathy
and
curiosity
our
flock
was
freely
confided
if
she
was
honorine
she
was
clémentine
or
augustine
which
is
a
trifle
since
what
i
thus
recover
in
any
case
of
these
brushings
of
the
strange
parisian
dew
is
those
communities
of
contemplation
that
made
us
most
hang
about
the
jewellers
windows
in
the
palais
royal
and
the
public
playbills
of
the
theatres
on
the
boulevard
the
palais
royal
now
so
dishonoured
and
disavowed
was
then
the
very
paris
of
paris
the
shutters
of
the
shops
seemed
taken
down
at
that
hour
for
our
especial
benefit
and
i
remember
well
how
the
dressing
of
so
large
a
number
of
the
compact
and
richly
condensed
fronts
being
more
often
than
not
a
matter
of
diamonds
and
pearls
rubies
and
sapphires
that
represented
in
their
ingenuities
of
combination
and
contortion
the
highest
taste
of
the
time
i
found
open
to
me
any
amount
of
superior
study
of
the
fact
that
the
spell
of
gems
seemed
for
the
feminine
nature
almost
alarmingly
boundless
i
stared
too
it
comes
back
to
me
at
these
exhibitions
and
perhaps
even
thought
it
became
a
young
man
of
the
world
to
express
as
to
this
or
that
object
a
refined
and
intelligent
preference
but
what
i
really
most
had
before
me
was
the
chorus
of
abjection
as
i
might
well
have
called
it
led
at
the
highest
pitch
by
honorine
and
vaguely
suggesting
to
me
by
the
crudity
so
to
say
of
its
wistfulness
a
natural
frankness
of
passion
goodness
knew
in
fact
for
my
small
intelligence
really
did
what
depths
of
corruptibility
droll
enough
as
i
win
them
again
these
queer
dim
plays
of
consciousness
my
sense
that
my
innocent
companions
honorine
would
have
done
anything
or
everything
for
the
richest
ruby
and
that
though
one
could
one
self
be
decently
dead
to
that
richness
one
did
at
all
know
what
anything
might
be
or
in
the
least
what
everything
was
the
gushing
cousins
at
the
same
time
assuredly
knew
still
less
of
that
and
honorine
brave
gloss
of
a
whole
range
alike
of
possibilities
and
actualities
was
in
itself
a
true
social
grace
they
all
enjoyed
in
fine
while
i
somehow
but
wastefully
mused
which
was
after
all
my
form
of
enjoyment
i
was
shy
for
it
though
it
was
a
truth
and
perhaps
odd
enough
withal
that
i
did
really
at
all
care
for
gems
that
rubies
and
pearls
in
no
matter
what
collocations
left
me
comparatively
cold
that
i
actually
cared
for
them
about
as
little
as
monstrously
secretly
painfully
i
cared
for
flowers
later
on
i
was
to
become
aware
that
i
adored
trees
and
architectural
marbles
that
for
a
sufficient
slab
of
a
sufficiently
rare
sufficiently
bestreaked
or
empurpled
marble
in
particular
i
would
have
given
a
bag
of
rubies
but
by
then
the
time
had
passed
for
my
being
troubled
to
make
out
what
in
that
case
would
represent
on
a
small
boy
part
the
corruptibility
so
to
call
it
proclaimed
before
the
by
the
cousins
that
had
as
a
question
later
on
its
actuality
but
it
had
so
much
at
the
time
that
if
it
had
been
frankly
put
to
me
i
must
have
quite
confessed
my
inability
to
say
and
must
i
gather
by
the
same
stroke
have
been
ashamed
of
such
inward
penury
feeling
that
as
a
boy
i
showed
more
poorly
than
girls
there
was
a
difference
meanwhile
for
such
puzzlements
before
the
porticos
of
the
theatres
all
questions
melted
for
me
there
into
the
single
depth
of
envy
envy
of
the
equal
the
beatific
command
of
the
evening
hour
in
the
of
young
train
who
were
fresh
for
the
early
sparrow
and
the
chiffonier
even
after
shedding
buckets
of
tears
the
night
before
and
not
so
much
as
for
the
first
or
the
second
time
over
the
beautiful
story
of
la
dame
aux
camélias
there
indeed
was
another
humiliation
but
by
my
weakness
of
position
much
more
than
of
nature
whatever
doing
of
everything
might
have
been
revealed
to
me
as
a
means
to
the
end
i
would
certainly
have
done
it
for
a
sight
of
madame
doche
and
fechter
in
triumphant
idyll
now
enjoying
the
fullest
honours
of
innocuous
classicism
with
which
as
with
the
merits
of
its
interpreters
honorine
happy
charges
had
become
perfectly
and
if
not
quite
serenely
at
least
ever
so
responsively
and
feelingly
familiar
of
a
wondrous
mixed
sweetness
and
sharpness
and
queerness
of
uneffaced
reminiscence
is
all
that
aspect
of
the
cousins
and
the
rambles
and
the
overlapping
nights
melting
along
the
odorously
bedamped
and
retouched
streets
and
arcades
bright
in
the
ineffable
morning
light
above
all
of
our
peculiar
young
culture
and
candour
all
of
which
again
has
too
easily
led
me
to
drop
for
a
moment
my
more
leading
clue
of
that
radiation
of
goodnature
from
gertrude
pendleton
and
her
headlong
hospitalities
in
which
we
perhaps
most
complacently
basked
the
becraped
passage
at
meurice
alluded
to
a
little
back
was
of
a
later
season
and
the
radiation
as
i
recall
it
had
been
that
first
winter
mainly
from
a
somewhere
on
the
other
side
as
we
used
with
a
large
sketchiness
to
say
of
the
champs
elysées
a
region
at
that
time
reduced
to
no
regularity
but
figuring
to
my
fond
fancy
as
a
chaos
of
accidents
and
contrasts
where
of
archaic
type
were
elbowed
by
woodyards
and
cabarets
and
pavilions
ever
so
characteristic
yet
ever
so
indefinable
snuggled
between
frank
industries
and
vulgarities
all
brightened
these
indeed
by
the
sociable
note
of
paris
be
it
only
that
of
chaffering
or
of
other
the
great
consistencies
of
now
of
so
large
a
harmony
were
still
to
come
so
that
it
seemed
rather
original
to
live
there
in
spite
of
which
the
attraction
of
the
hazard
of
it
on
the
part
of
our
then
so
uniformly
natural
young
kinswoman
not
so
much
ingeniously
or
even
expressively
as
just
gesticulatively
and
helplessly
gay
since
that
earlier
pitch
of
new
york
parlance
scarce
arrived
at
or
for
that
matter
pretended
to
enunciation
was
quite
in
what
i
at
least
took
to
be
the
glitter
of
her
very
conventions
and
traditions
themselves
exemplified
for
instance
by
a
bright
nocturnal
in
honour
of
the
small
son
of
all
hopes
whom
she
was
so
precipitately
to
lose
an
occasion
which
as
we
had
in
our
way
known
the
act
of
baptism
but
as
so
abbreviated
and
in
fact
so
tacit
a
business
had
the
effect
for
us
of
one
of
the
great
forms
of
a
society
taking
itself
with
typical
seriousness
we
were
much
more
serious
than
the
pendletons
but
paradoxically
enough
there
was
that
weakness
in
our
state
of
our
being
able
to
make
no
such
attestation
of
it
the
evening
can
have
been
but
of
the
friendliest
easiest
and
least
pompous
nature
with
small
guests
in
congruity
with
its
small
hero
as
well
as
large
but
i
must
have
found
myself
more
than
ever
yet
in
presence
of
a
rite
one
of
those
round
which
as
many
kinds
of
circumstance
as
possible
clustered
so
that
the
more
of
these
there
were
the
more
one
might
imagine
a
great
social
order
observed
how
shall
i
now
pretend
to
say
how
many
kinds
of
circumstance
i
supposed
i
recognised
with
the
remarkable
one
to
begin
with
and
which
led
fancy
so
far
afield
that
the
religious
ceremony
was
at
the
same
time
a
party
of
twinkling
lustres
and
disposed
flowers
and
ladies
with
bare
shoulders
that
platitudinous
bareness
of
the
period
that
suggested
somehow
the
moral
line
drawn
as
with
a
ruler
and
a
firm
pencil
with
little
english
girls
daughters
of
a
famous
physician
of
that
nationality
then
pursuing
a
parisian
career
he
must
have
helped
the
little
victim
into
the
world
and
whose
emphasised
type
much
impressed
itself
with
round
glazed
and
beribboned
boxes
of
sugared
almonds
dragées
de
baptême
above
all
which
we
harvested
in
their
heaps
as
we
might
have
gathered
apples
from
a
shaken
tree
and
which
symbolised
as
nothing
else
the
ritual
dignity
perhaps
this
grand
impression
really
came
back
but
to
the
dragées
de
baptême
not
strictly
more
immemorial
to
our
young
appreciation
than
the
new
year
cake
and
the
election
cake
known
to
us
in
new
york
yet
immensely
more
official
and
of
the
nature
of
scattered
largesse
partly
through
the
days
and
days
as
it
seemed
to
me
that
our
life
was
to
be
furnished
reinforced
and
almost
encumbered
with
them
it
was
simply
that
they
were
so
toothsome
but
that
they
were
somehow
so
important
and
so
historic
it
was
with
no
such
frippery
however
that
i
connected
the
occasional
presence
among
us
of
the
young
member
of
the
cousinship
in
this
case
of
the
maternal
who
most
moved
me
to
wistfulness
of
wonder
though
not
at
all
with
his
then
marked
difference
of
age
by
inviting
my
free
approach
vernon
king
to
whom
i
have
in
another
part
of
this
record
alluded
at
that
time
doing
his
baccalauréat
on
the
other
side
of
the
seine
and
coming
over
to
our
world
at
scraps
of
moments
for
i
recall
my
awe
of
the
tremendous
nature
as
i
supposed
it
of
his
toil
as
to
quite
a
and
gingerbread
place
the
lightest
of
substitutes
for
the
europe
in
which
he
had
been
from
the
first
so
technically
plunged
his
mother
and
sister
also
on
an
earlier
page
referred
to
had
from
their
distance
committed
him
to
the
great
city
to
be
finished
educationally
to
the
point
that
for
our
strenuous
cousin
charlotte
was
the
only
proper
one
and
i
feel
sure
he
can
have
acquitted
himself
in
this
particular
in
a
manner
that
would
have
passed
for
brilliant
if
such
lights
did
thanks
to
her
stiff
little
standards
always
tend
to
burn
low
in
her
presence
these
ladies
were
to
develop
more
and
more
the
practice
of
living
in
odd
places
for
abstract
inhuman
reasons
at
marseilles
at
düsseldorf
if
i
rightly
recall
their
principal
german
sojourn
at
naples
above
all
for
a
long
stage
where
in
particular
their
grounds
of
residence
were
somehow
not
as
those
of
others
even
though
i
recollect
from
a
much
later
time
attending
them
there
at
the
opera
an
experience
which
in
their
fashion
they
succeeded
in
despoiling
for
me
of
every
element
of
the
concrete
or
at
least
of
the
pleasantly
vulgar
later
impressions
few
but
firm
were
so
to
enhance
one
tenderness
for
vernon
own
image
the
most
interesting
surely
in
all
the
troop
of
our
young
kinsmen
early
baffled
and
gathered
that
he
glances
at
me
out
of
the
paris
period
just
always
smiling
and
catching
his
breath
a
little
as
from
a
mixture
of
eagerness
and
shyness
with
such
an
appeal
to
the
right
idealisation
or
to
belated
justice
as
makes
of
mere
evocation
a
sort
of
exercise
of
loyalty
it
seemed
quite
richly
laid
upon
me
at
the
time
i
get
it
all
back
that
he
two
or
three
years
older
than
my
elder
brother
and
dipped
more
early
as
well
as
held
more
firmly
in
the
deep
the
refining
waters
the
virtue
of
which
we
all
together
though
with
our
differences
of
consistency
recognised
was
the
positive
and
living
proof
of
what
the
process
comparatively
poor
for
ourselves
could
do
at
its
best
and
with
clay
originally
and
domestically
kneaded
to
the
right
plasticity
besides
which
he
shone
to
my
fancy
and
all
the
more
for
its
seeming
so
brightly
and
quietly
in
his
very
grain
with
the
vague
the
supposititious
but
the
intensely
stamp
of
the
latin
quarter
which
we
so
thinly
imagined
and
so
superficially
brushed
on
our
pious
walks
to
the
luxembourg
and
through
the
parts
where
the
glamour
might
have
hung
thickest
we
were
to
see
him
a
little
but
two
or
three
times
three
or
four
years
later
when
just
before
our
own
return
he
had
come
back
to
america
for
the
purpose
if
my
memory
serves
of
entering
the
harvard
law
school
and
to
see
him
still
always
with
the
smile
that
was
essentially
as
facial
as
livingly
and
loosely
fixed
somehow
as
his
fresh
complexion
itself
always
too
with
the
air
of
caring
so
little
for
what
he
had
been
put
through
that
under
any
appeal
to
give
out
more
or
less
wonderfully
some
sample
or
echo
of
it
as
who
should
say
he
still
mostly
panted
as
from
a
laughing
mental
embarrassment
he
had
been
put
through
too
much
it
was
all
stale
to
him
and
he
would
have
known
where
to
begin
he
did
give
out
a
little
on
occasion
speaking
that
is
on
my
different
plane
as
it
were
and
by
the
roundabout
report
of
my
brother
he
gave
out
it
appeared
as
they
walked
together
across
shining
newport
sands
some
fragment
some
beginning
of
a
very
youthful
poem
that
europe
had
with
other
results
moved
him
to
and
a
faint
thin
shred
of
which
was
to
stick
in
my
remembrance
for
reasons
independent
of
its
quality
harold
rememberest
thou
the
day
we
rode
along
the
appian
way
neglected
tomb
and
altar
cast
their
lengthening
shadow
the
plain
and
while
we
talked
the
mighty
past
around
us
lived
and
breathed
again
that
was
european
enough
and
yet
he
had
returned
to
america
really
to
find
himself
even
with
every
effort
made
immediately
near
him
to
defeat
the
discovery
he
found
himself
with
the
outbreak
of
the
war
simply
as
the
american
soldier
and
not
under
any
bribe
however
dim
of
the
epaulette
or
the
girt
sword
but
just
as
the
common
enlisting
native
which
he
smiled
and
gasped
to
the
increase
of
his
happy
shortness
of
breath
as
from
a
repletion
of
culture
since
it
suggested
no
lack
of
personal
soundness
at
feeling
himself
so
to
be
as
strange
yet
as
still
more
touching
than
strange
i
recall
the
sight
even
at
a
distance
of
the
drop
straight
off
him
of
all
his
layers
of
educational
varnish
the
possession
of
the
advantages
the
tongues
the
degrees
the
diplomas
the
reminiscences
a
saturation
too
that
had
all
sunk
in
a
sacrifice
of
precious
attributes
that
might
almost
have
been
viewed
as
a
wild
bonfire
so
his
prodigious
mother
whom
i
have
perhaps
sufficiently
presented
for
my
reader
to
understand
did
fail
to
view
it
judging
it
also
sharply
hostile
to
the
action
of
the
north
as
the
whole
dreadful
situation
found
her
with
deep
and
resentful
displeasure
i
remember
how
i
thought
of
vernon
himself
during
the
business
as
at
once
so
despoiled
so
diverted
and
above
all
so
resistantly
bright
as
vaguely
to
suggest
something
more
in
him
still
some
reaction
some
extremity
of
indifference
and
defiance
some
exhibition
of
a
young
character
too
long
pressed
and
impressed
too
long
prescribed
to
and
with
too
much
expected
of
it
and
all
under
too
firmer
a
will
so
that
the
public
pretext
had
given
him
a
lift
or
lent
him
wings
which
without
its
greatness
might
have
failed
him
as
the
case
was
to
turn
nothing
that
is
nothing
he
most
wanted
and
remarkably
most
enjoyed
did
fail
him
at
all
i
forget
with
which
of
the
possible
states
new
york
massachusetts
or
rhode
island
though
i
think
the
first
he
had
taken
service
only
seeming
to
remember
that
this
all
went
on
for
him
at
the
start
in
mcclellan
and
later
on
in
grant
army
and
that
badly
wounded
in
a
virginia
battle
he
came
home
to
be
nursed
by
his
mother
recently
restored
to
america
for
a
brief
stay
she
held
i
believe
in
the
event
that
he
had
under
her
care
given
her
his
vow
that
his
term
being
up
he
would
not
should
he
get
sufficiently
well
the
question
here
was
between
them
but
it
was
definite
that
materially
speaking
she
was
in
no
degree
dependent
on
him
the
old
the
irrepressible
adage
however
was
to
live
again
between
them
when
the
devil
was
sick
the
devil
a
saint
would
be
when
the
devil
was
well
the
devil
a
saint
was
he
the
devil
a
saint
at
all
events
was
vernon
who
denied
that
he
had
passed
his
word
and
who
as
soon
as
he
had
surmounted
his
first
disablement
passionately
and
quite
admirably
at
once
restored
to
the
front
and
to
what
now
gave
life
for
him
its
indispensable
relish
he
was
in
the
thick
again
of
the
great
carnage
roundabout
richmond
where
again
gravely
wounded
he
as
i
figure
still
incorrigibly
smiling
succumbed
his
mother
had
by
this
time
indignantly
returned
to
europe
accompanied
by
her
daughter
and
her
younger
son
the
former
of
whom
accepted
for
our
great
pity
a
little
later
on
the
office
of
closing
the
story
anne
king
young
and
frail
but
not
less
firm
under
stress
than
the
others
of
her
blood
came
back
on
her
brother
death
and
quietest
most
colourless
electra
of
a
lucidest
orestes
making
her
difficult
way
amid
massed
armies
and
fields
got
possession
of
his
buried
body
and
bore
it
for
reinterment
to
newport
the
old
habitation
as
i
have
mentioned
of
their
people
both
vernons
and
kings
it
must
have
been
to
see
my
mother
as
well
as
to
sail
again
for
europe
that
she
afterwards
came
to
boston
where
i
remember
going
down
with
her
at
the
last
to
the
dock
of
the
english
steamer
some
black
and
cunarder
an
archaic
africa
or
asia
sufficing
to
the
boston
service
of
those
days
i
saw
her
off
drearily
and
helplessly
enough
i
well
remember
and
even
at
that
moment
found
for
her
another
image
what
was
she
most
like
though
in
a
still
sparer
and
dryer
form
but
some
some
employed
little
brontë
heroine
though
more
indeed
a
lucy
snowe
than
a
jane
eyre
and
with
no
shade
of
a
brontë
hero
within
sight
to
this
all
the
fine
privilege
and
fine
culture
of
all
the
fine
countries
collective
matter
from
far
back
of
our
intimated
envy
had
amounted
just
as
it
had
amounted
for
vernon
to
the
bare
headstone
on
the
newport
hillside
where
by
his
mother
decree
as
i
have
already
noted
there
figured
no
hint
of
the
manner
of
his
death
so
grand
so
finely
personal
a
manner
it
appeared
to
me
at
the
time
and
has
indeed
appeared
ever
since
that
this
brief
record
irrepressibly
springs
from
that
his
mother
as
i
have
equally
noted
was
however
with
her
views
to
find
no
grace
in
it
so
long
as
she
lived
and
his
sister
went
back
to
her
and
to
marseille
as
they
always
called
it
but
prematurely
to
die
xxix
i
feel
that
much
might
be
made
of
my
memories
of
had
i
but
here
left
room
for
the
vast
little
subject
in
which
i
should
probably
once
started
wander
to
and
fro
as
exploringly
as
perceivingly
as
discoveringly
i
am
fairly
tempted
to
call
it
as
might
really
give
the
measure
of
my
small
operations
at
the
time
i
was
almost
wholly
reduced
there
to
operations
of
that
mere
inward
and
superficially
idle
order
at
which
we
have
already
so
freely
assisted
reduced
by
a
cause
i
shall
presently
mention
the
production
of
a
great
blur
after
the
fashion
of
some
mild
domestic
but
quite
considerably
spreading
in
respect
to
the
world
of
action
such
as
it
was
more
or
less
immediately
about
me
i
must
personally
have
lived
during
this
pale
predicament
almost
only
by
seeing
what
i
could
after
my
incorrigible
ambulant
fashion
a
practice
that
may
well
have
made
me
pass
for
bringing
home
nothing
in
the
least
exhibitional
rather
than
by
pursuing
the
inquiries
and
interests
that
agitated
to
whatever
intensity
our
on
the
whole
widening
little
circle
the
images
i
speak
of
as
matter
for
more
evocation
that
i
can
spare
them
were
the
fruit
of
two
different
periods
at
boulogne
a
shorter
and
a
longer
this
second
appearing
to
us
all
at
the
time
i
gather
too
endlessly
and
blightingly
prolonged
so
sharply
before
it
was
over
did
i
at
any
rate
come
to
yearn
for
the
rue
montaigne
again
the
rue
montaigne
sublet
for
a
term
under
a
flurry
produced
in
my
parents
breasts
by
a
financial
crisis
of
great
violence
to
which
the
american
world
as
a
matter
now
of
recorded
history
i
believe
had
tragically
fallen
victim
and
which
had
imperilled
or
curtailed
for
some
months
our
moderate
means
of
existence
we
were
to
recover
i
make
out
our
disturbed
balance
and
were
to
pursue
awhile
further
our
chase
of
the
alien
the
somehow
repeatedly
postponed
opportunity
and
the
second
the
comparatively
cramped
and
depressed
connection
with
the
classic
refuge
as
it
then
was
of
spasmodic
thrift
when
not
of
settled
indigence
for
the
embarrassed
of
our
race
in
the
largest
sense
of
this
matter
was
to
be
shuffled
off
at
last
with
no
scant
relief
and
reaction
this
is
perhaps
exactly
why
the
whole
picture
of
our
existence
at
the
watering
place
pleads
to
me
now
for
the
full
indulgence
what
would
be
in
other
words
every
touch
of
tenderness
workable
after
all
the
years
over
the
lost
and
confused
and
above
all
on
their
own
side
poor
ultimately
rather
vulgarised
and
violated
little
sources
of
impression
items
and
aspects
these
which
while
they
in
their
degree
and
after
their
sort
flourished
we
only
asked
to
admire
or
at
least
to
appreciate
for
their
rewarding
extreme
queerness
the
very
centre
of
my
particular
consciousness
of
the
place
turned
too
soon
to
the
fact
of
my
coming
in
there
for
the
gravest
illness
of
my
life
an
all
but
mortal
attack
of
the
malignant
typhus
of
old
days
which
after
laying
me
as
low
as
i
could
well
be
laid
for
many
weeks
condemned
me
to
a
convalescence
so
arduous
that
i
saw
my
apparently
scant
possibilities
by
the
measure
of
them
then
taken
even
as
through
a
glass
darkly
or
through
the
expansive
blur
for
which
i
found
just
above
a
homely
image
this
experience
was
to
become
when
i
had
emerged
from
it
the
great
reminiscence
or
circumstance
of
old
boulogne
for
me
and
i
was
to
regard
it
with
much
intelligence
i
should
have
maintained
as
the
marked
limit
of
my
state
of
being
a
small
boy
i
took
on
when
i
had
decently
and
all
the
more
because
i
had
so
retardedly
recovered
the
sense
of
being
a
boy
of
other
dimensions
somehow
altogether
and
even
with
a
new
dimension
introduced
and
acquired
a
dimension
that
i
was
eventually
to
think
of
as
a
stretch
in
the
direction
of
essential
change
or
of
living
straight
into
a
part
of
myself
previously
quite
unvisited
and
now
made
accessible
as
by
the
sharp
forcing
of
a
closed
door
the
blur
of
consciousness
imaged
by
my
was
not
i
hasten
to
declare
without
its
relenting
edges
and
even
during
its
major
insistence
fainter
thicknesses
short
of
which
i
see
my
picture
the
picture
i
was
always
so
incurably
after
would
have
failed
of
animation
altogether
quite
have
failed
to
bristle
with
characteristics
with
figures
and
objects
and
scenic
facts
particular
passages
and
moments
the
stuff
in
short
of
that
scrap
of
minor
gain
which
i
have
spoken
of
as
our
multiplied
memories
was
i
even
at
the
time
and
much
more
later
on
to
feel
how
we
had
been
through
the
thick
and
thin
of
the
whole
adventure
assaulted
as
never
before
in
so
concentrated
a
way
by
local
and
social
character
such
was
the
fashion
after
which
the
boulogne
of
long
ago
i
have
known
next
to
nothing
of
it
since
could
come
forth
come
more
than
as
we
say
to
meet
the
imagination
open
to
such
advances
it
was
taking
one
thing
with
another
so
verily
drenched
in
character
that
i
see
myself
catching
this
fine
flagrancy
almost
equally
in
everything
unless
indeed
i
may
have
felt
it
rather
smothered
than
presented
on
the
comparatively
sordid
scene
of
the
collège
communal
not
long
afterwards
to
expand
i
believe
into
the
local
lycée
to
which
the
inimitable
process
of
our
education
promptly
introduced
us
i
was
to
have
less
of
the
collège
than
my
elder
and
my
younger
brother
thanks
to
the
interrupting
illness
that
placed
me
so
long
with
its
trail
of
half
complacently
half
ruefully
apart
but
i
suffered
for
a
few
early
weeks
the
mainly
malodorous
sense
of
the
braver
life
produced
as
this
was
by
a
deeply
democratic
institution
from
which
no
small
son
even
of
the
most
soapless
home
could
possibly
know
exclusion
odd
i
recognise
that
i
should
inhale
the
air
of
the
place
so
particularly
so
almost
only
to
that
dismal
effect
since
character
was
there
too
for
whom
it
should
concern
and
my
view
of
some
of
the
material
conditions
of
the
general
collegiate
presence
toward
the
top
of
the
steepish
grand
rue
on
the
right
and
not
much
short
as
it
comes
back
to
me
of
the
then
closely
clustered
and
inviolate
haute
ville
the
more
or
less
surviving
old
town
the
idle
grey
rampart
the
moated
and
towered
citadel
the
bastion
for
strolling
and
sitting
immortalised
by
thackeray
achieved
the
monumental
in
its
degree
after
a
fashion
never
yet
associated
for
us
with
the
pursuit
of
learning
did
the
campaigner
suffering
indigence
at
the
misapplied
hands
of
colonel
newcome
rage
at
that
hushed
victim
supremely
and
dreadfully
just
thereabouts
by
which
i
mean
in
the
over
some
question
of
a
sacrificed
sweetbread
or
a
cold
hacked
joint
that
somebody
had
been
at
beside
such
builded
approaches
to
an
education
as
we
had
elsewhere
known
the
collège
exhibited
with
whatever
reserves
the
measure
of
style
which
almost
any
french
accident
of
the
administratively
architectural
order
more
easily
rises
to
than
fails
of
even
if
the
matter
be
but
a
question
of
the
shyest
similitude
of
a
the
court
disconnecting
the
scene
by
intention
at
least
from
the
basely
bourgeois
and
giving
value
to
the
whole
effect
of
opposed
and
windowed
wall
and
important
or
balanced
and
placed
these
are
many
words
for
the
dull
precinct
as
then
presented
i
admit
and
they
are
perhaps
half
prompted
by
a
special
association
too
ghostly
now
quite
to
catch
again
the
sense
of
certain
sundays
distinct
from
the
grim
that
is
the
flatly
instructional
body
of
the
week
when
i
seem
to
myself
to
have
successfully
flouted
the
whole
constituted
field
by
passing
across
it
and
from
it
to
some
quite
ideally
little
annexed
de
as
inviolate
in
its
way
as
the
grey
rampart
and
bare
citadel
and
very
like
them
in
unrelieved
tone
where
i
repeatedly
and
without
another
presence
to
hinder
looked
about
me
at
goodness
knows
what
weird
ancientries
of
stale
academic
art
not
one
of
these
treasures
in
its
habit
as
it
lived
do
i
recall
yet
the
sense
and
the
note
of
them
was
at
the
time
none
the
less
not
so
elusive
that
i
did
somehow
draw
straight
from
them
intimations
of
the
interesting
that
is
revelations
of
the
æsthetic
the
historic
the
critical
mystery
and
charm
of
things
of
such
things
taken
altogether
that
added
to
my
small
loose
handful
of
the
seed
of
culture
that
apprehension
was
in
its
way
of
our
house
of
learning
too
and
yet
i
recall
how
on
the
scant
and
simple
terms
i
have
glanced
at
i
quite
revelled
in
it
whereas
other
impressions
of
my
brief
ordeal
shrink
for
anything
in
the
nature
of
interest
but
to
three
or
four
recovered
marks
of
the
social
composition
of
the
school
there
were
the
sons
of
all
the
small
and
not
less
by
my
remembrance
of
certain
of
the
mechanics
and
artisans
but
there
was
also
the
english
contingent
these
predominantly
and
uniformed
and
even
to
an
effect
of
odd
redundancy
who
by
my
conceit
gave
our
association
a
lift
vivid
still
to
me
is
the
summer
morning
on
which
in
the
wide
court
as
wide
that
is
as
i
liked
to
suppose
it
and
where
we
hung
about
helplessly
enough
for
recreation
a
brownish
youth
of
about
my
own
degree
of
youthfulness
mentioned
to
me
with
an
air
that
comes
back
as
that
of
the
liveliest
informational
resource
the
outbreak
just
heard
of
of
an
awful
mutiny
in
india
where
his
military
parents
who
had
not
so
long
before
sent
him
over
thence
with
such
weakness
of
imagination
as
i
measured
it
to
the
poor
spot
on
which
we
stood
were
in
mortal
danger
of
their
lives
so
that
news
of
their
having
been
killed
would
perhaps
be
already
on
the
way
they
might
well
have
been
military
these
impressively
exposed
characters
since
my
friend
name
was
napier
or
nappié
as
he
was
called
at
the
school
and
since
i
may
add
also
there
attached
to
him
in
my
eyes
the
glamour
of
an
altogether
new
emphasis
of
type
the
english
boys
within
our
ken
since
our
coming
abroad
had
been
of
the
fewest
the
fezandié
youths
whether
english
or
american
besides
being
but
scantly
boys
had
been
so
lost
on
that
scene
in
our
heap
of
disparities
and
it
pressed
upon
me
after
a
fashion
of
its
own
that
those
we
had
known
in
new
york
and
all
aware
of
their
varieties
and
personalities
as
one
had
supposed
one
self
had
in
no
case
challenged
the
restless
placing
impulse
with
any
such
force
as
the
finished
little
nappié
they
had
not
been
as
he
was
by
the
very
perversity
of
his
finish
resultants
of
forces
at
all
or
comparatively
speaking
it
was
as
if
their
producing
elements
had
been
simple
and
few
whereas
behind
this
more
mixed
and
as
we
have
learnt
to
say
evolved
companion
his
very
simplicities
his
gaps
of
possibility
being
still
evolved
there
massed
itself
i
could
have
said
what
protective
social
order
what
tangled
creative
complexity
why
i
should
have
thought
him
almost
indian
of
stamp
and
hue
because
his
english
parents
were
of
the
so
general
indian
peril
is
more
than
i
can
say
yet
i
have
his
exotic
and
above
all
his
bold
his
imaginably
even
bad
young
face
finely
unacquainted
with
law
before
me
at
this
hour
quite
undimmed
announcing
as
i
conceived
it
and
quite
as
a
shock
any
awful
adventure
one
would
as
well
as
something
that
i
must
even
at
the
time
have
vaguely
taken
as
the
play
of
the
passions
he
vanishes
and
i
dare
say
i
but
make
him
over
as
i
make
everything
and
he
must
have
led
his
life
whatever
it
was
to
become
with
the
least
possible
waiting
on
the
hour
or
the
major
consequence
and
no
waste
of
energy
at
all
in
mooning
no
patience
with
any
substitute
for
his
very
own
humour
we
had
another
schoolmate
this
one
native
to
the
soil
whose
references
were
with
the
last
vividness
local
and
who
was
yet
to
escape
with
brilliancy
in
the
aftertime
the
smallest
shadow
of
effacement
his
most
direct
reference
at
that
season
was
to
the
principal
of
the
town
an
establishment
we
then
found
supreme
for
little
apple
tartlets
and
melting
young
coquelin
home
life
amid
which
we
the
more
acutely
envied
that
the
upward
cock
of
his
so
nose
testified
for
my
fancy
to
the
largest
range
of
free
familiar
sniffing
coquelin
is
personally
most
present
to
me
in
the
form
of
that
hour
by
the
value
as
we
were
to
learn
to
put
it
of
this
nose
the
fine
assurance
and
impudence
of
which
fairly
made
it
a
trumpet
for
promises
yet
in
spite
of
that
the
very
gage
as
it
were
of
his
long
career
as
the
most
interesting
and
comedian
or
at
least
most
unsurpassed
dramatic
of
his
time
i
failed
to
doubt
that
with
the
rich
recesses
of
the
parental
industry
for
his
background
his
subtlest
identity
was
in
his
privilege
or
perhaps
even
in
his
expertest
trick
of
helping
himself
well
these
images
however
were
but
drops
in
the
bucket
of
my
sense
of
catching
character
roundabout
us
as
i
say
at
every
turn
and
in
every
aspect
character
that
began
even
as
i
was
pleased
to
think
in
our
own
habitation
the
most
spacious
and
pompous
europe
had
yet
treated
us
to
in
spite
of
its
fronting
on
the
rue
neuve
chaussée
a
street
of
lively
shopping
by
the
measure
of
that
innocent
age
and
with
its
own
occupied
by
a
bristling
exhibition
of
indescribably
futile
de
modern
and
commodious
itself
it
looked
from
its
balcony
at
serried
and
mismatched
and
haunts
of
old
provincial
of
sedately
passive
rather
than
confidently
eager
traffic
but
this
made
among
us
for
much
harmless
inquisitory
life
while
we
were
fairly
assaulted
at
home
by
the
scale
and
some
of
the
striking
notes
of
our
fine
modernity
the
young
the
agreeable
agreeable
to
anything
the
apparently
opulent
prosper
sauvage
was
it
had
not
long
before
unless
i
mistake
inherited
the
place
as
a
monument
of
family
quite
modestly
local
yet
propitious
family
ambition
with
an
ample
extension
in
the
rear
and
across
the
clearest
prettiest
court
for
his
own
dwelling
which
thus
became
elegant
cour
et
and
showed
all
the
happy
symmetries
and
proper
conventions
here
flourished
or
rather
i
surmise
at
this
time
of
day
here
languished
a
domestic
drama
of
which
we
enjoyed
the
murmurous
overflow
frankly
astounding
to
me
i
confess
how
i
remain
still
in
sensitive
presence
of
our
resigned
proprietor
domestic
drama
in
and
out
of
which
i
see
a
pair
of
figures
quite
up
to
the
dramatic
mark
flit
again
with
their
air
of
the
very
rightest
finish
i
must
but
note
these
things
none
the
less
and
pass
for
scarce
another
item
of
the
whole
boulogne
concert
of
salient
images
failed
after
all
of
a
significance
either
still
more
strangely
social
or
more
distinctively
spectacular
these
appearances
indeed
melt
together
for
my
interest
i
once
more
feel
as
during
the
interminable
stretch
of
the
prescribed
and
for
the
most
part
solitary
airings
and
outings
involved
in
my
slow
convalescence
from
the
extremity
of
fever
i
approached
that
straitened
and
somewhat
bedarkened
issue
of
the
rue
de
was
it
toward
the
port
just
where
merridew
english
library
solace
of
my
vacuous
hours
and
temple
in
its
degree
too
of
deep
initiations
mounted
guard
at
the
right
here
frankly
discrimination
drops
every
particular
in
the
impression
once
so
quick
and
fresh
sits
interlinked
with
every
other
in
the
large
lap
of
the
whole
the
motley
sunny
breezy
bustling
port
with
its
classic
its
admirable
of
both
sexes
models
of
type
and
tone
and
of
what
might
be
handsomest
in
the
thoroughly
weathered
condition
would
have
seemed
the
straightest
appeal
to
curiosity
had
not
the
old
thackerayan
side
as
i
may
comprehensively
call
it
and
the
scattered
wealth
of
illustration
of
sharpest
satiric
range
not
so
constantly
interposed
and
competed
with
it
the
scene
bristled
as
i
look
back
at
it
with
images
from
men
wives
from
the
society
of
deuceace
and
that
of
fifty
other
figures
of
the
same
creation
with
bareacreses
and
rawdon
crawleys
and
of
course
with
macks
with
roseys
of
a
more
or
less
crumpled
freshness
and
blighted
bloom
with
battered
and
bent
though
doubtless
never
quite
so
fine
colonel
newcomes
not
less
with
more
reminders
in
short
than
i
can
now
gather
in
of
those
forms
of
the
seedy
the
subtly
sinister
the
vainly
genteel
the
generally
damaged
and
desperate
and
in
particular
perhaps
the
invincibly
impudent
all
the
marks
i
feel
sure
were
stronger
and
straighter
than
such
as
we
meet
in
generally
like
cases
under
our
present
levelling
light
such
anointed
and
whiskered
and
such
brazen
bluffing
swaggering
gentlemen
such
floridly
repaired
ladies
their
mates
all
looking
as
hard
as
they
could
as
if
they
were
there
for
mere
harmless
amusement
it
was
as
good
among
them
as
just
arthur
pendennis
to
know
so
well
or
at
least
to
guess
so
fearfully
who
and
what
they
might
be
they
were
floated
on
the
tide
of
the
manners
then
prevailing
i
judge
with
a
rich
processional
effect
that
so
many
of
our
own
grand
lapses
when
not
of
our
mere
final
flatnesses
leave
no
material
for
so
that
the
living
note
of
boulogne
was
really
on
a
more
sustained
view
the
opposition
between
a
native
race
the
most
happily
tempered
the
most
becomingly
seasoned
and
salted
and
and
a
shifting
colony
so
far
as
the
persons
composing
it
either
urgently
or
speculatively
shift
inimitably
at
odds
with
any
active
freshness
and
the
stale
and
the
light
even
though
so
scantly
rebounding
the
too
densely
socialised
group
was
the
english
and
the
positive
and
hardy
and
steady
and
the
french
and
it
was
all
as
flushed
with
colour
and
patched
with
costume
and
referable
to
record
and
picture
to
literature
and
history
as
a
more
easily
amusing
and
less
earnestly
uniform
age
could
make
it
when
i
speak
of
this
opposition
indeed
i
see
it
again
most
take
effect
in
an
antithesis
that
on
one
side
and
the
other
swallowed
all
differences
at
a
gulp
the
general
british
show
as
we
had
it
there
in
the
artless
desert
had
i
think
for
its
most
sweeping
sign
the
high
assurance
of
its
dowdiness
whereas
one
had
only
to
glance
about
at
the
and
who
were
the
real
strength
of
the
place
to
feel
them
shed
at
every
step
and
by
their
every
instinct
of
appearance
the
perfect
lesson
of
taste
there
it
was
to
be
learnt
and
taken
home
with
never
a
moral
none
the
less
drawn
from
it
by
the
higher
types
i
speak
of
course
in
particular
of
the
tanned
and
trussed
and
kerchiefed
the
active
and
productive
women
all
so
and
under
stress
for
as
by
the
rule
of
the
dowdy
their
sex
is
ever
the
finer
example
so
where
the
sense
of
the
suitable
of
the
charmingly
and
harmoniously
right
prevails
they
preserve
the
pitch
even
as
a
treasure
committed
to
their
piety
to
hit
that
happy
mean
of
rightness
amid
the
mixed
occupations
of
a
and
a
fishwife
to
be
in
especial
both
so
bravely
stripped
below
and
so
perfectly
enveloped
above
as
the
matrons
or
maidens
who
played
with
the
tides
and
racily
quickened
the
market
was
to
make
grace
thoroughly
practical
and
discretion
thoroughly
vivid
these
attributes
had
with
them
all
for
the
eye
however
a
range
too
great
for
me
to
follow
since
as
their
professional
undress
was
a
positively
so
their
household
or
more
responsibly
public
or
altogether
festal
array
played
through
the
varied
essentials
of
fluted
coif
and
folded
kerchief
and
sober
skirt
and
tense
dark
displayed
stocking
and
clicking
wooden
slipper
to
say
nothing
of
long
gold
or
solid
pectoral
cross
with
a
respect
for
the
rigour
of
conventions
that
had
the
beauty
of
i
owe
to
no
season
of
the
general
period
such
a
preserved
sense
of
innumerable
unaccompanied
walks
at
the
reason
of
which
luxury
of
freedom
i
have
glanced
which
as
often
as
not
were
through
the
steep
and
and
of
the
and
either
across
and
along
the
level
and
sustained
cliff
beyond
this
latter
the
site
of
the
first
napoleon
so
tremendously
mustered
camp
of
invasion
with
a
monument
as
futile
by
my
remembrance
as
that
enterprise
itself
had
proved
to
give
it
all
the
special
accent
i
could
ask
for
or
i
was
as
free
for
the
and
the
ramparts
and
the
scattered
battered
benches
of
reverie
if
i
may
so
honour
my
use
of
them
they
kept
me
not
less
complacently
in
touch
with
those
of
the
so
anciently
odd
and
mainly
contracted
houses
over
which
the
stiff
citadel
and
the
ghost
of
catherine
de
médicis
who
had
dismally
sojourned
in
it
struck
me
as
throwing
such
a
chill
and
one
of
which
precisely
must
have
witnessed
the
campaigner
passage
in
respect
to
her
cold
beef
far
from
extinct
for
me
is
my
small
question
of
those
hours
doubtless
so
mentally
so
shamelessly
wanton
as
to
what
human
life
might
be
tucked
away
in
such
retreats
which
expressed
the
last
acceptance
whether
of
desired
or
of
imposed
quiet
so
absolutely
appointed
and
obliged
did
i
feel
to
make
out
so
far
as
i
could
what
in
so
significant
a
world
they
on
their
part
i
think
the
force
mainly
sustaining
me
at
that
rather
dreary
time
as
i
see
it
can
only
show
for
was
this
lively
felt
need
that
everything
should
represent
something
more
than
what
immediately
and
all
too
blankly
met
the
eye
i
seem
to
myself
to
have
carried
it
about
everywhere
and
though
of
course
only
without
outward
signs
that
might
have
betrayed
my
fatuity
and
insistently
quite
yearningly
applied
it
what
i
wanted
in
my
presumption
was
that
the
object
the
place
the
person
the
unreduced
impression
often
doubtless
so
difficult
or
so
impossible
to
reduce
should
give
out
to
me
something
of
a
situation
living
as
i
did
in
confused
and
confusing
situations
and
thus
hooking
them
on
however
awkwardly
to
almost
any
at
all
living
surface
i
chanced
to
meet
my
memory
of
boulogne
is
that
we
had
almost
no
society
of
any
sort
at
home
there
appearing
to
be
about
us
but
one
sort
and
that
of
far
too
great
or
too
fearful
an
immediate
bravery
yet
there
were
occasional
figures
that
i
recover
from
our
scant
circle
and
that
i
associate
whatever
links
i
may
miss
with
the
small
still
houses
on
the
rampart
figures
of
the
quaintest
quite
perhaps
the
frowsiest
little
english
ladies
in
such
mushroom
hats
such
extremely
circular
and
bestriped
scarlet
petticoats
such
perpetual
tight
gauntlets
such
explicit
claims
to
long
descent
which
showed
them
for
everything
that
everyone
else
at
boulogne
was
not
these
samples
of
a
perfect
consistency
represented
by
my
measure
as
hard
as
ever
they
could
and
represented
of
all
things
literature
and
history
and
society
the
literature
was
that
of
the
novel
then
and
for
much
after
enjoying
its
loosest
and
serenest
spread
for
they
separately
and
anxiously
and
awfully
wrote
and
that
must
almost
by
itself
have
amounted
in
them
to
all
the
history
i
evoked
the
dreary
months
as
i
am
content
that
in
their
second
phase
especially
they
should
be
called
are
subject
i
repeat
to
the
perversion
quite
perhaps
to
the
obscuration
of
my
temporarily
hindered
health
which
should
keep
me
from
being
too
sure
of
these
small
of
experience
i
was
to
look
back
afterwards
as
over
so
grey
a
desert
through
which
none
the
less
there
flush
as
sharp
little
certainties
not
to
be
disallowed
such
matters
as
the
general
romance
of
merridew
the
english
librarian
before
mentioned
at
the
mouth
of
the
port
a
connection
that
thrusts
itself
upon
me
now
as
after
all
the
truest
centre
of
my
perceptions
waylaying
my
steps
at
the
time
as
i
came
and
went
more
than
any
other
object
or
impression
the
question
of
what
spot
represented
or
could
be
encouraged
could
be
aided
and
abetted
to
represent
may
well
have
supremely
engaged
me
for
depth
within
depth
there
could
only
open
before
me
the
place
meant
on
these
terms
to
begin
with
frank
and
licensed
fiction
licensed
to
my
recordedly
relaxed
state
and
what
this
particular
luxury
represented
it
might
have
taken
me
even
more
time
than
i
had
to
give
to
make
out
the
blest
novel
in
three
volumes
exercised
through
its
form
to
my
sense
on
grounds
lying
deeper
for
me
than
my
deepest
sounding
an
appeal
that
fairly
made
it
do
with
me
what
it
would
possibly
a
drivelling
confession
and
the
more
drivelling
perhaps
the
more
development
i
should
attempt
for
it
from
which
however
the
very
difficulty
of
the
case
saves
me
too
many
associations
too
much
of
the
ferment
of
memory
and
fancy
are
somehow
stirred
they
beset
me
again
they
hover
and
whirl
about
me
while
i
stand
as
i
used
to
stand
within
the
positively
sanctified
walls
of
the
shop
so
of
the
now
their
aspect
and
fashion
and
worked
system
by
which
i
mean
again
of
the
frumpiest
and
civillest
and
surrender
to
the
vision
of
the
shelves
packed
with
their
rich
individual
trinities
why
should
it
have
affected
me
so
that
my
choice
so
difficult
in
such
a
dazzle
could
only
be
for
a
trinity
i
am
unable
fully
to
say
such
a
magic
dwelt
in
the
mere
rich
fact
of
the
trio
when
the
novel
of
that
age
was
bad
as
it
so
helplessly
so
abjectly
and
prevailingly
consented
to
be
the
three
volumes
still
did
something
for
it
a
something
that
was
all
strangely
not
an
aggravation
of
its
case
when
it
was
good
our
analysis
our
terms
of
appreciation
had
a
simplicity
that
has
lingered
on
they
made
it
copiously
opulently
better
so
that
when
after
the
span
of
the
years
my
relation
with
them
became
from
that
of
comparatively
artless
reader
and
to
the
effect
of
a
superior
fondness
and
acuteness
that
of
complacent
author
the
tradition
of
infatuated
youth
still
flung
over
them
its
mantle
this
at
least
till
relation
by
one
of
the
very
rudest
turns
of
life
we
of
the
profession
were
to
have
known
broke
off
in
clumsy
interfering
hands
and
with
almost
no
notice
given
in
a
day
in
an
hour
besides
connecting
me
with
the
lost
but
unforgotten
note
of
waiting
service
and
sympathy
that
quavered
on
the
merridew
air
they
represented
just
for
intrinsic
charm
more
than
i
could
at
any
moment
have
given
a
plain
account
of
they
fell
by
their
ineffable
history
every
trio
i
ever
touched
into
the
category
of
such
prized
phenomena
as
my
memory
for
instance
of
fairly
hanging
about
the
rue
des
vieillards
at
the
season
i
speak
of
through
the
apprehension
that
something
vague
and
sweet
if
i
should
indeed
rather
say
something
of
infinite
future
point
and
application
would
come
of
it
this
is
a
reminiscence
that
nothing
would
induce
me
to
verify
as
for
example
by
any
revisiting
light
but
it
was
going
to
be
good
for
me
good
that
is
for
what
i
was
pleased
to
regard
as
my
intelligence
or
my
imagination
in
fine
for
my
obscurely
specific
sense
of
things
that
i
so
have
hung
about
the
name
of
the
street
was
by
itself
of
so
gentle
and
intimate
a
persuasion
that
i
must
have
been
ashamed
not
to
proceed
for
the
very
grace
of
it
to
some
shade
of
active
response
and
there
was
always
a
place
of
particular
arrest
in
the
vista
brief
and
blank
but
inclusively
blank
blank
ancient
settled
more
and
more
subsiding
things
blank
almost
in
short
with
all
matthew
arnold
ennui
of
the
middle
ages
rather
than
poorly
and
meanly
and
emptily
before
such
states
which
was
previously
what
i
had
most
known
of
blankness
this
determined
pause
was
at
the
window
of
a
spare
and
solitary
shop
a
place
of
no
amplitude
at
all
but
as
of
an
inveterate
cheerful
confidence
where
among
a
few
artists
materials
an
exhibited
from
some
native
and
possibly
then
admired
hand
was
changed
but
once
in
ever
so
long
that
was
perhaps
after
all
the
pivot
of
my
revolution
the
question
of
whether
or
no
i
should
at
a
given
moment
find
the
old
picture
replaced
i
made
this
when
i
had
the
luck
pass
for
an
event
yet
an
event
which
would
to
have
had
for
its
scene
the
precious
rue
des
vieillards
and
pale
though
may
be
the
recital
of
such
pleasures
i
lose
myself
in
depths
of
kindness
for
my
strain
of
ingenuity
all
of
which
and
to
that
extent
to
be
corrected
leaves
small
allowance
for
my
service
to
good
ansiot
rendered
while
my
elder
and
younger
brothers
the
younger
completing
our
group
of
the
ungovernessed
were
continuously
subject
to
collegial
durance
their
ordeal
was
i
still
blush
to
think
appreciably
the
heavier
as
compared
with
mine
during
our
longer
term
of
thrifty
exile
from
paris
the
time
of
stress
as
i
find
i
recall
it
when
we
had
turned
our
backs
on
the
rue
montaigne
and
my
privilege
was
so
to
roam
on
the
winter
and
the
spring
afternoons
mild
ansiot
under
whom
i
for
some
three
hours
each
forenoon
sat
sole
and
underided
and
actually
by
himself
too
was
a
curiosity
a
benignity
a
futility
even
i
gather
but
save
for
a
felt
and
remembered
impulse
in
me
to
open
the
window
of
our
scene
of
study
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
was
in
no
degree
an
ideal
he
might
rise
here
could
i
do
him
justice
as
the
rarest
of
my
poor
evocations
for
he
it
was
to
be
frank
who
most
literally
smelt
of
the
vieux
temps
as
to
which
i
have
noted
myself
as
wondering
and
musing
as
much
as
might
be
with
recovered
scraps
and
glimpses
and
other
intimations
only
never
yet
for
such
a
triumph
of
that
particular
sense
to
be
still
frank
he
was
little
less
than
a
monster
for
mere
unresisting
or
unresilient
mass
of
personal
presence
i
mean
so
that
i
fairly
think
of
him
as
a
form
of
bland
porpoise
violently
blowing
in
an
age
not
his
own
as
by
having
had
to
exchange
deep
water
for
thin
air
thus
he
impressed
me
as
with
an
absolute
ancientry
of
type
of
tone
of
responsible
taste
above
all
this
last
i
mean
in
literature
since
it
was
literature
we
sociably
explored
to
my
at
once
charmed
and
shamed
apprehension
of
the
several
firm
traditions
the
pure
proprieties
the
discussabilities
in
the
oddest
way
both
so
many
and
so
few
of
that
field
as
they
prevailed
to
his
pious
view
i
must
have
had
hold
in
this
mere
sovereign
sample
of
the
accidentally
the
quite
unconsciously
and
unpretentiously
the
all
negligibly
or
superfluously
of
a
rare
case
of
the
provincial
and
academic
though
even
while
i
record
it
i
see
the
good
man
as
too
helpless
and
unaggressive
too
smothered
in
his
poor
facts
of
person
and
circumstance
of
overgrown
time
of
life
alone
to
incur
with
justness
the
harshness
of
classification
he
rested
with
a
weight
i
scarce
even
felt
such
easy
terms
he
made
without
scruple
for
both
of
us
on
the
cheerful
innocence
of
my
barbarism
and
though
our
mornings
were
short
and
subject
i
think
to
quite
drowsy
lapses
and
other
honest
aridities
we
did
scumble
together
i
make
out
by
the
aid
of
the
collected
extracts
from
the
truly
and
academically
great
which
formed
his
sole
resource
and
which
he
had
in
a
small
portable
and
pocketed
library
rather
greasily
preserved
some
patch
of
picture
of
a
saving
as
distinguished
from
a
losing
classicism
the
point
remains
for
me
that
when
all
was
said
and
even
with
everything
that
might
directly
have
counted
unsaid
he
discharged
for
me
such
an
office
that
i
was
to
remain
to
this
hour
in
a
state
of
possession
of
him
that
is
the
very
opposite
of
a
blank
quite
after
the
fashion
again
in
which
i
had
all
along
and
elsewhere
suffered
and
resisted
and
yet
so
perversely
and
intimately
appropriated
tutoring
which
was
with
as
little
as
ever
to
show
for
my
profit
of
his
own
express
showings
the
blank
he
fills
out
crowds
itself
with
a
wealth
of
value
since
i
should
without
him
have
been
able
to
claim
for
whatever
it
may
be
worth
a
tenth
at
that
let
me
handsomely
put
it
of
my
working
sense
of
the
vieux
temps
how
can
i
allow
then
that
we
had
planted
together
with
a
loose
felicity
some
of
the
seed
of
work
even
though
the
sprouting
was
so
long
put
off
everything
i
have
mentioned
had
come
at
this
time
to
be
acceptedly
though
far
from
braggingly
put
off
and
the
ministrations
of
ansiot
really
wash
themselves
over
with
the
weak
mixture
that
had
begun
to
spread
for
me
to
immensity
during
that
summer
day
or
two
of
our
earlier
residence
when
betraying
strange
pains
and
apprehensions
i
was
with
all
decision
put
to
bed
present
to
me
still
is
the
fact
of
my
sharper
sense
after
an
hour
or
two
of
my
being
there
in
distress
and
as
happened
for
the
moment
alone
present
to
me
are
the
sounds
of
the
soft
afternoon
the
mild
animation
of
the
boulogne
street
through
the
windows
present
to
me
above
all
the
strange
sense
that
something
had
begun
that
would
make
more
difference
to
me
directly
and
indirectly
than
anything
had
ever
yet
made
i
might
verily
on
the
spot
have
seen
as
in
a
fading
of
day
and
a
change
to
something
suddenly
queer
the
whole
large
extent
of
it
i
must
thus
much
impressed
but
half
scared
have
wanted
to
appeal
to
which
end
i
tumbled
all
too
weakly
out
of
bed
and
wavered
toward
the
bell
just
across
the
room
the
question
of
whether
i
really
reached
and
rang
it
was
to
remain
lost
afterwards
in
the
strong
sick
whirl
of
everything
about
me
under
which
i
fell
into
a
lapse
of
consciousness
that
i
shall
conveniently
here
treat
as
a
considerable
gap
the
end
