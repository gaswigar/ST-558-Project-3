ambassador
gerard
saying
to
the
americans
leaving
on
a
special
train
august
my
four
years
in
germany
by
james
gerard
late
ambassador
to
the
german
imperial
court
to
my
small
but
tactful
family
of
one
my
wife
foreword
i
am
writing
what
should
have
been
the
last
chapter
of
this
book
as
a
foreword
because
i
want
to
bring
home
to
our
people
the
gravity
of
the
situation
because
i
want
to
tell
them
that
the
military
and
naval
power
of
the
german
empire
is
unbroken
that
of
the
twelve
million
men
whom
the
kaiser
has
called
to
the
colours
but
one
million
five
hundred
thousand
have
been
killed
five
hundred
thousand
permanently
disabled
not
more
than
five
hundred
thousand
are
prisoners
of
war
and
about
five
hundred
thousand
constitute
the
number
of
wounded
or
those
on
the
sick
list
of
each
day
leaving
at
all
times
about
nine
million
effectives
under
arms
i
state
these
figures
because
americans
do
not
grasp
either
the
magnitude
or
the
importance
of
this
war
perhaps
the
statement
that
over
five
million
prisoners
of
war
are
held
in
the
various
countries
will
bring
home
to
americans
the
enormous
mass
of
men
engaged
there
have
been
no
great
losses
in
the
german
navy
and
any
losses
of
ships
have
been
compensated
for
by
the
building
of
new
ones
the
nine
million
men
and
more
for
at
least
four
hundred
thousand
come
of
military
age
in
germany
every
year
because
of
their
experience
in
two
and
a
half
years
of
war
are
better
and
more
efficient
soldiers
than
at
the
time
when
they
were
called
to
the
colours
their
officers
know
far
more
of
the
science
of
this
war
and
the
men
themselves
now
have
the
skill
and
bearing
of
veterans
nor
should
anyone
believe
that
germany
will
break
under
starvation
or
make
peace
because
of
revolution
the
german
nation
is
not
one
which
makes
revolutions
there
will
be
scattered
riots
in
germany
but
no
simultaneous
rising
of
the
whole
people
the
officers
of
the
army
are
all
of
one
class
and
of
a
class
devoted
to
the
ideals
of
autocracy
a
revolution
of
the
army
is
impossible
and
at
home
there
are
only
the
boys
and
old
men
easily
kept
in
subjection
by
the
police
there
is
far
greater
danger
of
the
starvation
of
our
allies
than
of
the
starvation
of
the
germans
every
available
inch
of
ground
in
germany
is
cultivated
and
cultivated
by
the
aid
of
the
old
men
the
boys
and
the
women
and
the
two
million
prisoners
of
war
the
arable
lands
of
northern
france
and
of
roumania
are
being
cultivated
by
the
german
army
with
an
efficiency
never
before
known
in
these
countries
and
most
of
that
food
will
be
added
to
the
food
supplies
of
germany
certainly
the
people
suffer
but
still
more
certainly
this
war
will
not
be
ended
because
of
the
starvation
of
germany
although
thinking
germans
know
that
if
they
do
not
win
the
war
the
financial
day
of
reckoning
will
come
nevertheless
owing
to
the
clever
financial
handling
of
the
country
by
the
government
and
the
great
banks
there
is
at
present
no
financial
distress
in
germany
and
the
knowledge
that
unless
indemnities
are
obtained
from
other
countries
the
weight
of
the
great
war
debt
will
fall
upon
the
people
perhaps
makes
them
readier
to
risk
all
in
a
final
attempt
to
win
the
war
and
impose
indemnities
upon
not
only
the
nations
of
europe
but
also
upon
the
united
states
of
america
we
are
engaged
in
a
war
against
the
greatest
military
power
the
world
has
ever
seen
against
a
people
whose
country
was
for
so
many
centuries
a
theatre
of
devastating
wars
that
fear
is
bred
in
the
very
marrow
of
their
souls
making
them
ready
to
submit
their
lives
and
fortunes
to
an
autocracy
which
for
centuries
has
ground
their
faces
but
which
has
promised
them
as
a
result
of
the
war
not
only
security
but
riches
untold
and
the
dominion
of
the
world
a
people
which
as
from
a
high
mountain
has
looked
upon
the
cities
of
the
world
and
the
glories
of
them
and
has
been
promised
these
cities
and
these
glories
by
the
devils
of
autocracy
and
of
war
we
are
warring
against
a
nation
whose
poets
and
professors
whose
pedagogues
and
whose
parsons
have
united
in
stirring
its
people
to
a
white
pitch
of
hatred
first
against
russia
then
against
england
and
now
against
america
the
peril
is
a
very
real
one
for
england
russia
may
either
break
up
into
civil
wars
or
become
so
ineffective
that
the
millions
of
german
troops
engaged
on
the
russian
front
may
be
withdrawn
and
hurled
against
the
western
lines
we
stand
in
great
peril
and
only
the
exercise
of
ruthless
realism
can
win
this
war
for
us
if
germany
wins
this
war
it
means
the
triumph
of
the
autocratic
system
it
means
the
triumph
of
those
who
believe
not
only
in
war
as
a
national
industry
not
only
in
war
for
itself
but
also
in
war
as
a
high
and
noble
occupation
unless
germany
is
beaten
the
whole
world
will
be
compelled
to
turn
itself
into
an
armed
camp
until
the
german
autocracy
either
brings
every
nation
under
its
dominion
or
is
forever
wiped
out
as
a
form
of
government
we
are
in
this
war
because
we
were
forced
into
it
because
germany
not
only
murdered
our
citizens
on
the
high
seas
but
also
filled
our
country
with
spies
and
sought
to
incite
our
people
to
civil
war
we
were
given
no
opportunity
to
discuss
or
negotiate
the
hour
ultimatum
given
by
austria
to
serbia
was
not
as
bernard
shaw
said
a
decent
time
in
which
to
ask
a
man
to
pay
his
hotel
bill
what
of
the
ultimatum
given
to
me
in
berlin
on
the
evening
of
january
when
i
was
notified
at
six
that
ruthless
warfare
would
commence
at
twelve
why
the
german
government
which
up
to
that
moment
had
professed
amity
and
a
desire
to
stand
by
the
pledges
knew
that
it
took
almost
two
days
to
send
a
cable
to
america
i
believe
that
we
are
not
only
justly
in
this
war
but
prudently
in
this
war
if
we
had
stayed
out
and
the
war
had
been
drawn
or
won
by
germany
we
should
have
been
attacked
and
that
while
europe
stood
grinning
by
not
directly
at
first
but
through
an
attack
on
some
central
or
south
american
state
to
which
it
would
be
at
least
as
difficult
for
us
to
send
troops
as
for
germany
and
what
if
this
powerful
nation
vowed
to
war
were
once
firmly
established
in
south
or
central
america
what
of
our
boasted
isolation
then
it
is
only
because
i
believe
that
our
people
should
be
informed
that
i
have
consented
to
write
this
book
there
are
too
many
thinkers
writers
and
speakers
in
the
united
states
from
now
on
we
need
the
doers
the
organisers
and
the
realists
who
alone
can
win
this
contest
for
us
for
democracy
and
for
permanent
peace
writing
of
events
so
new
i
am
of
course
compelled
to
exercise
a
great
discretion
to
keep
silent
on
many
things
of
which
i
would
speak
to
suspend
many
judgments
and
to
hold
for
future
disclosure
many
things
the
relation
of
which
now
would
perhaps
only
serve
to
increase
bitterness
or
to
cause
internal
dissension

our
own

a
loud
knocking
woke
me
at
seven
the
radio
handed
in
from
a
friend
in

told
me
of
my
appointment
as

colonel
harvey
and
clarence
mackay
gave
me
a
dinner
of
covers
something
of
a
record
at
sea
for
long
afterwards
in
germany
i
saw
everywhere
pictures
of
the
including
one
of
the
tables
set
for
this
dinner
these
were
sent
out
over
germany
as
a
sort
of
propaganda
to
induce
the
germans
to
patronise
their
own
ships
and
indulge
in
ocean
travel
i
wish
that
the
propaganda
had
been
earlier
and
more
successful
because
it
is
by
travel
that
peoples
learn
to
know
each
other
and
consequently
to
abstain
from
war
on
the
night
of
the
usual
ship
concert
henry
morgenthau
translated
a
little
speech
for
me
into
german
which
i
managed
to
get
through
after
painfully
learning
it
by
heart
now
that
i
have
a
better
knowledge
of
german
a
cold
sweat
breaks
out
when
i
think
of
the
awful
german
accent
with
which
i
delivered
that
address
a
flying
trip
to
berlin
early
in
august
to
look
into
the
house
question
followed
and
then
i
returned
to
the
united
states
in
september
i
went
to
washington
to
be
instructed
talked
with
the
president
and
secretary
and
sat
at
the
feet
of
the
assistant
secretary
of
state
alvey
adee
the
revered
sage
of
the
department
of
state
on
september
ninth
having
resigned
as
justice
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
i
sailed
for
germany
stopping
on
the
way
in
london
in
order
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
ambassador
page
certain
wise
people
in
washington
having
expressed
the
belief
that
a
personal
acquaintance
of
our
ambassadors
made
it
easier
for
them
to
work
together
two
cares
assail
a
newly
appointed
ambassador
he
must
first
take
thought
of
what
he
shall
wear
and
where
he
shall
live
all
other
nations
have
beautiful
embassies
or
legations
in
berlin
but
i
found
that
my
two
immediate
predecessors
had
occupied
a
villa
originally
built
as
a
house
pleasantly
enough
situated
but
two
miles
from
the
centre
of
berlin
and
entirely
unsuitable
for
an
embassy
there
are
few
private
houses
in
berlin
most
of
the
people
living
in
apartments
after
some
trouble
i
found
a
handsome
house
on
the
wilhelm
platz
immediately
opposite
the
chancellor
palace
and
the
foreign
office
in
the
very
centre
of
berlin
this
house
had
been
built
as
a
palace
for
the
princes
hatzfeld
and
had
later
passed
into
the
possession
of
a
banking
family
named
von
schwabach
the
united
states
government
unlike
other
nations
does
not
own
or
pay
the
rent
of
a
suitable
embassy
but
gives
allowance
for
offices
if
the
house
is
large
enough
to
afford
office
room
for
the
office
force
of
the
embassy
the
von
schwabach
palace
was
nothing
but
a
shell
even
the
gas
and
electric
light
fixtures
had
been
removed
and
when
the
hot
water
and
heating
system
electric
lights
and
fixtures
had
been
put
in
and
the
house
furnished
from
top
to
bottom
my
first
salary
had
far
passed
the
minus
point
the
palace
was
not
ready
for
occupancy
until
the
end
of
january
and
in
the
meantime
we
lived
at
the
hotel
esplanade
and
i
transacted
business
at
the
old
villa
there
are
more
diplomats
in
berlin
than
in
any
other
capital
in
the
world
because
each
of
the
states
constituting
the
german
empire
sends
a
legation
to
berlin
even
the
free
cities
of
hamburg
lübeck
and
bremen
have
a
resident
minister
at
the
empire
capital
invariable
custom
requires
a
new
ambassador
in
berlin
to
give
two
receptions
one
to
the
diplomatic
corps
and
the
other
to
all
those
people
who
have
the
right
to
go
to
court
these
are
the
officials
nobles
and
officers
of
the
army
and
navy
and
such
other
persons
as
have
been
presented
at
court
such
people
are

me
in
the
first
coach
the
men
of
the
embassy
staff
sat
in
the
other
two
coaches
our
little
procession
progressed
solemnly
through
the
streets
of
berlin
passing
on
the
way
through
the
centre
division
of
the
arch
known
as
the
brandenburger
thor
the
gateway
that
stands
at
the
head
of
the
unter
den
linden
a
privilege
given
only
on
this
occasion
we
mounted
long
stairs
in
the
palace
and
in
a
large
room
were
received
by
the
aides
and
the
officers
of
the
emperor
household
of
course
all
in
uniform
then
i
was
ushered
alone
into
the
adjoining
room
where
the
emperor
very
erect
and
dressed
in
the
black
uniform
of
the
death
head
hussars
stood
by
a
table
i
made
him
a
little
speech
and
presented
my
letters
of
credence
and
the
letters
of
recall
of
my
predecessor
the
emperor
then
unbent
from
his
very
erect
and
impressive
attitude
and
talked
with
me
in
a
very
friendly
manner
especially
impressing
me
with
his
interest
in
business
and
commercial
affairs
i
then
in
accordance
with
custom
asked
leave
to
present
my
staff
the
doors
were
opened
the
staff
came
in
and
were
presented
to
the
emperor
who
talked
in
a
very
jolly
and
agreeable
way
to
all
of
us
saying
that
he
hoped
above
all
to
see
the
whole
of
the
embassy
staff
riding
in
the
tier
garten
in
the
mornings
the
emperor
is
a
most
impressive
figure
and
in
his
black
uniform
surrounded
by
his
officers
certainly
looked
every
inch
a
king
although
my
predecessors
on
occasions
of
this
kind
had
worn
a
sort
of
fancy
diplomatic
uniform
designed
by
themselves
i
decided
to
abandon
this
and
return
to
the
democratic
if
unattractive
and
uncomfortable
simply
because
the
newspapers
of
america
and
certain
congressmen
while
they
have
had
no
objection
to
the
wearing
of
uniforms
by
the
army
and
navy
police
and
postmen
and
do
not
expect
officers
to
lead
their
troops
into
battle
in
have
nevertheless
had
a
most
extraordinary
prejudice
against
american
diplomats
following
the
usual
custom
of
adopting
a
diplomatic
uniform
some
days
after
my
presentation
to
the
emperor
i
was
taken
to
potsdam
which
is
situated
about
half
an
hour
train
journey
from
berlin
and
from
the
station
there
driven
to
the
new
palace
and
presented
to
the
empress
the
empress
was
most
charming
and
affable
and
presented
a
very
distinguished
appearance
accompanied
by
gerard
and
always
either
by
night
or
by
day
in
the
infernal
i
was
received
by
the
crown
prince
and
princess
and
others
of
the
royal
princes
and
their
wives
on
these
occasions
we
sat
down
and
did
not
stand
as
when
received
by
the
emperor
and
empress
and
simply
made
polite
conversation
for
about
twenty
minutes
being
received
first
by
the
and
aides
these
princes
were
always
in
uniform
of
some
kind
at
the
reception
for
the
people
gerard
stood
in
one
room
and
i
in
another
and
with
each
of
us
was
a
representative
of
the
emperor
household
to
introduce
the
people
of
the
court
and
an
army
officer
to
introduce
the
people
of
the
army
the
officer
assigned
to
me
had
the
extraordinary
name
of
der
pfortner
von
der
hoelle
which
means
the
porter
of
hell
i
have
often
wondered
since
by
what
prophetic
instinct
he
was
sent
to
introduce
me
to
the
two
years
and
a
half
of
world
war
which
i
experienced
in
berlin
this
unfortunate
officer
a
most
charming
gentleman
was
killed
early
in
the
war
the
berlin
season
lasts
from
about
the
twentieth
of
january
for
about
six
weeks
it
is
short
in
duration
because
if
the
people
stay
longer
than
six
weeks
in
berlin
they
become
liable
to
pay
their
local
income
tax
in
berlin
where
the
rate
is
higher
than
in
those
parts
of
germany
where
they
have
their
country
estates
the
first
great
court
ceremonial
is
the
from
the
long
trains
or
worn
by
the
women
on
this
night
we
presented
and
robert
cassatt
of
philadelphia
ernest
wiltsee
and
miss
luce
and
norman
whitehouse
on
the
arrival
at
the
palace
with
these
and
all
the
members
of
the
embassy
staff
and
their
wives
we
were
shown
up
a
long
at
the
top
of
which
a
guard
of
honour
dressed
in
costume
of
the
time
of
frederick
the
great
presented
arms
to
all
ambassadors
and
ruffled
through
long
lines
of
cadets
from
the
military
schools
dressed
as
pages
in
white
with
short
breeches
and
powdered
wigs
we
passed
through
several
rooms
where
all
the
people
to
pass
in
review
were
gathered
behind
these
in
a
room
about
sixty
feet
by
fifty
on
a
throne
facing
the
door
were
the
emperor
and
empress
and
on
the
broad
steps
of
this
throne
were
the
princes
and
their
wives
the
court
and
all
the
other
members
of
the
court
the
wives
of
the
ambassadors
entered
the
room
first
followed
at
intervals
of
about
twenty
feet
by
the
ladies
of
the
embassy
and
the
ladies
to
be
presented
as
they
entered
the
room
and
made
a
change
of
direction
toward
the
throne
pages
in
white
straightened
out
the
ladies
trains
with
long
sticks
arrived
opposite
the
throne
and
about
twenty
feet
from
it
each
wife
made
a
low
curtsey
and
then
stood
on
the
foot
of
the
throne
to
the
left
of
the
emperor
and
empress
and
as
each
lady
of
the
embassy
not
before
presented
and
each
lady
to
be
presented
stopped
beside
the
throne
and
made
a
low
curtsey
the
ambassadress
had
to
call
out
the
name
of
each
one
in
a
loud
voice
and
when
the
last
one
had
passed
she
followed
her
out
of
the
room
walking
sideways
so
as
not
to
turn
her
back
on
the
royalties
something
of
a
feat
when
towing
a
train
about
fifteen
feet
long
when
all
the
ambassadresses
had
so
passed
it
was
the
turn
of
the
ambassadors
who
carried
out
substantially
the
same
programme
substituting
low
bows
for
curtsies
the
ambassadors
were
followed
by
the
wives
these
by
the
ministers
and
these
by
the
dignitaries
of
the
german
court
all
passed
into
the
adjoining
hall
and
there
a
buffet
supper
was
served
the
whole
affair
began
at
about
eight
and
was
over
in
an
hour
at
the
court
balls
which
also
began
early
in
the
evening
a
different
procedure
was
followed
there
the
guests
were
required
to
assemble
before
in
the
as
in
the
on
one
side
of
the
room
was
the
throne
with
seats
for
the
emperor
and
empress
and
to
the
right
of
this
throne
were
the
chairs
for
the
ambassadors
wives
who
were
seated
in
the
order
of
their
husbands
rank
with
the
ladies
of
their
embassy
and
any
ladies
they
had
brought
to
the
ball
standing
behind
them
after
them
came
the
ministers
wives
sitting
in
similar
fashion
then
the
ambassadors
standing
with
their
staffs
behind
them
on
raised
steps
with
any
men
that
they
had
asked
invitations
for
and
the
ministers
in
similar
order
to
the
left
of
the
throne
stood
the
wives
of
the
dukes
and
dignitaries
of
germany
and
then
their
husbands
when
all
were
assembled
promptly
at
the
time
announced
the
orchestra
which
was
dressed
in
mediæval
costume
and
sat
in
a
gallery
sounded
trumpets
and
then
the
emperor
and
empress
entered
the
room
the
emperor
of
course
in
uniform
followed
by
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
household
all
in
brilliant
uniforms
and
one
or
two
officers
of
the
court
regiment
picked
out
for
their
great
height
and
dressed
in
the
kind
of
uniform
rupert
of
hentzau

on
the
stage
a
silver
helmet
surmounted
by
an
eagle
a
steel
white
breeches
and
coat
and
enormous
high
boots
coming
half
way
up
the
thigh
the
grand
huntsman
wore
a
white
wig
hat
and
a
long
green
coat
on
entering
the
room
the
empress
usually
commenced
on
one
side
and
the
emperor
on
the
other
going
around
the
room
and
speaking
to
the
ambassadors
wives
and
ambassadors
in
turn
and
the
empress
in
similar
fashion
chatting
for
a
moment
with
the
german
dignitaries
and
their
wives
lined
up
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
after
going
perhaps
half
way
around
each
side
the
emperor
and
empress
would
then
change
sides
this
going
around
the
room
and
chatting
with
people
in
turn
is
called
making
the
circle
and
young
royalties
are
practised
in
making
the
circle
by
being
made
to
go
up
to
the
trees
in
a
garden
and
address
a
few
pleasant
words
to
each
tree
in
this
manner
learning
one
of
the
principal
duties
of
royalty
the
dancing
is
only
by
young
women
and
young
officers
of
noble
families
who
have
practised
the
dances
before
they
are
under
the
superintendence
of
several
young
officers
who
are
known
as
and
when
anyone
in
berlin
in
court
society
gives
a
ball
these
are
the
ones
who
see
that
all
dancing
is
conducted
strictly
according
to
rule
and
manage
the
affairs
of
the
with
true
prussian
efficiency
supper
is
about
at
a
court
ball
and
is
at
small
tables
each
royalty
has
a
table
holding
about
eight
people
and
to
these
people
are
invited
without
particular
rule
as
to
precedence
the
younger
guests
and
lower
dignitaries
are
not
placed
at
supper
but
find
places
at
tables
to
suit
themselves
after
supper
all
go
back
to
the
and
there
the
young
ladies
and
officers
led
by
the
execute
a
sort
of
lancers
in
the
final
figure
of
which
long
lines
are
formed
of
dancers
radiating
from
the
throne
and
all
the
dancers
make
bows
and
curtsies
to
the
emperor
and
empress
who
are
either
standing
or
sitting
at
this
time
on
the
throne
at
about
the
ball
is
over
and
as
the
guests
pass
out
through
the
long
hall
they
are
given
glasses
of
hot
punch
and
a
peculiar
sort
of
local
berlin
bun
in
order
to
ward
off
the
lurking
dangers
of
the
villainous
winter
climate
at
the
court
balls
the
diplomats
are
of
course
in
their
best
diplomatic
uniform
all
germans
are
in
uniform
of
some
kind
but
the
women
do
not
wear
the
long
trains
worn
at
the
they
wear
ordinary
ball
dresses
in
connection
with
court
dancing
it
is
rather
interesting
to
note
that
when
the
tango
and
turkey
trot
made
their
way
over
the
frontiers
of
germany
in
the
autumn
of
the
emperor
issued
a
special
order
that
no
officers
of
the
army
or
navy
should
dance
any
of
these
dances
or
should
go
to
the
house
of
any
person
who
at
any
time
whether
officers
were
present
or
not
had
allowed
any
of
these
new
dances
to
be
danced
this
effectually
extinguished
the
turkey
trot
the
bunny
hug
and
the
tango
and
maintained
the
waltz
and
the
polka
in
their
old
estate
it
may
seem
ridiculous
that
such
a
decree
should
be
so
solemnly
issued
but
i
believe
that
the
higher
authorities
in
germany
earnestly
desired
that
the
people
and
especially
the
officers
of
the
army
and
navy
should
learn
not
to
enjoy
themselves
too
much
a
great
endeavour
was
always
made
to
keep
them
in
a
life
so
far
as
possible
of
spartan
simplicity
for
instance
the
army
officers
were
forbidden
to
play
polo
not
because
of
anything
against
the
game
which
of
course
is
splendid
practice
for
riding
but
because
it
would
make
a
distinction
in
the
army
between
rich
and
poor

salon
in
the
american
embassy

ballroom
of

turned
into
a
workroom

in

days
the
emperor
birthday
january
is
a
day
of
great
celebration
at
in
the
morning
the
ambassadors
ministers
and
all
the
dignitaries
of
the
court
attend
divine
service
in
the
chapel
of
the
palace
on
this
day
in
the
queen
of
greece
and
many
of
the
reigning
princes
of
the
german
states
were
present
in
the
evening
there
was
a
gala
performance
in
the
opera
house
the
entire
house
being
occupied
by
members
of
the
court
between
the
acts
in
the
large
foyer
royalties
made
the
circle
and
i
had
quite
a
long
conversation
with
both
the
emperor
and
empress
and
was
caught
by
the
king
of
saxony
many
of
the
ambassadors
have
letters
of
credence
not
only
to
the
court
at
berlin
but
also
to
the
rulers
of
the
minor
german
states
for
instance
the
belgian
minister
was
accredited
to
thirteen
countries
in
germany
and
the
spanish
ambassador
to
eleven
for
some
reason
or
other
the
american
and
turkish
ambassadors
are
accredited
only
to
the
court
at
berlin
some
of
the
german
rulers
feel
this
quite
keenly
and
the
king
of
saxony
especially
i
had
been
warned
that
he
was
very
anxious
to
show
his
resentment
of
this
distinction
by
refusing
to
shake
hands
with
the
american
ambassador
he
was
in
the
foyer
on
the
occasion
of
this
gala
performance
and
said
that
he
would
like
to
have
me
presented
to
him
i
of
course
could
not
refuse
but
forgot
the
warning
of
my
predecessors
and
put
out
my
hand
which
the
king
ostentatiously
neglected
to
take
a
few
moments
later
the
wife
of
the
turkish
ambassador
was
presented
to
the
king
of
saxony
and
received
a
similar
rebuff
but
as
she
was
a
daughter
of
the
khedive
of
egypt
and
therefore
a
royal
highness
in
her
own
right
she
went
around
the
king
of
saxony
seized
his
hand
which
he
had
put
behind
him
brought
it
around
to
the
front
and
shook
it
warmly
a
fine
example
of
great
presence
of
mind
writing
of
all
these
things
and
looking
out
from
a
in
new
york
these
details
of
court
life
seem
very
frivolous
and
far
away
but
an
ambassador
is
compelled
to
become
part
of
this
system
the
most
important
conversations
with
the
emperor
sometimes
take
place
at
court
functions
and
the
ambassador
and
his
secretaries
often
gather
their
most
useful
bits
of
information
over
tea
cups
or
with
the
cigars
after
dinner
aside
from
the
short
season
berlin
is
rather
dull
bismarck
characterised
it
as
a
desert
of
bricks
and
newspapers
in
addition
to
making
visits
to
the
royalties
custom
required
me
to
call
first
upon
the
imperial
chancellor
and
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
the
other
ministers
are
supposed
to
call
first
although
i
believe
the
redoubtable
von
tirpitz
claimed
a
different
rule
so
during
the
first
winter
i
gradually
made
the
acquaintance
of
those
people
who
sway
the
destinies
of
the
german
empire
and
its
seventy
millions
i
dined
with
the
emperor
and
had
long
conversations
with
him
on
new
year
day
and
at
the
two
court
balls
all
during
this
winter
germans
from
the
highest
down
tried
to
impress
me
with
the
great
danger
which
they
said
threatened
america
from
japan
the
military
and
naval
attachés
and
i
were
told
that
the
german
information
system
sent
news
that
mexico
was
full
of
japanese
colonels
and
america
of
japanese
spies
possibly
much
of
the
prejudice
in
america
against
the
japanese
was
cooked
up
by
the
german
propagandists
whom
we
later
learned
to
know
so
well
it
is
noteworthy
that
during
the
whole
of
my
first
winter
in
berlin
i
was
not
officially
or
afforded
an
opportunity
to
meet
any
of
the
members
of
the
reichstag
or
any
of
the
leaders
in
the
business
world
the
great
merchants
whose
acquaintance
i
made
as
well
as
the
literary
and
artistic
people
i
had
to
seek
out
because
most
of
them
were
not
and
i
did
not
come
in
contact
with
them
at
any
court
functions
official
dinners
or
even
in
the
houses
of
the
court
nobles
or
those
connected
with
the
government
a
very
interesting
character
whom
i
met
during
the
first
winter
and
often
conversed
with
was
prince
prince
donnersmarck
who
died
december
at
the
age
of
years
was
the
richest
male
subject
in
germany
the
richest
subject
being
frau
von
the
heiress
of
the
krupp
cannon
foundry
he
was
the
first
governor
of
lorraine
during
the
war
of
and
had
had
a
finger
in
all
of
the
political
and
commercial
activities
of
germany
for
more
than
half
a
century
he
told
me
on
one
occasion
that
he
had
advocated
exacting
a
war
indemnity
of
thirty
milliards
from
france
after
the
war
of
and
said
that
france
could
easily
pay
it
and
that
that
sum
or
much
more
should
be
exacted
as
an
indemnity
at
the
conclusion
of
the
world
war
of
he
said
that
he
had
always
advocated
a
protective
tariff
for
agricultural
products
in
germany
as
well
as
encouragement
of
the
german
manufacturing
interests
that
agriculture
was
necessary
to
the
country
in
order
to
provide
strong
soldiers
for
war
and
manufacturing
industries
to
provide
money
to
pay
for
the
army
and
navy
and
their
equipment
he
made
me
promise
to
take
his
second
son
to
america
in
order
that
he
might
see
american
life
and
the
great
iron
and
coal
districts
of
pennsylvania
of
course
most
of
these
conversations
took
place
before
the
world
war
after
two
years
of
that
war
and
as
prospects
of
paying
the
expenses
of
the
war
from
the
indemnities
to
be
exacted
from
the
enemies
of
germany
gradually
melted
away
the
prince
quite
naturally
developed
a
great
anxiety
as
to
how
the
expenses
of
the
war
should
be
paid
by
germany
and
i
am
sure
that
this
anxiety
had
much
to
do
with
his
death
at
the
end
of
the
year
custom
demanded
that
i
should
ask
for
an
appointment
and
call
on
each
of
the
ambassadors
on
arrival
the
british
ambassador
was
sir
edward
goschen
a
man
of
perhaps
years
a
widower
he
spoke
french
of
course
and
german
and
accompanied
by
his
dog
was
a
frequent
visitor
at
our
house
i
am
very
grateful
for
the
help
and
advice
he
so
generously
gave
me
doubly
valuable
as
coming
from
a
man
of
his
fame
and
experience
jules
cambon
was
the
ambassador
of
france
his
brother
paul
is
ambassador
to
the
court
of
james
jules
cambon
is
to
americans
having
passed
five
years
in
this
country
he
was
ambassador
to
spain
for
five
years
and
at
the
time
of
my
arrival
had
been
about
the
same
period
at
berlin
in
spite
of
his
long
residence
in
each
of
these
countries
he
spoke
only
french
but
he
possessed
a
really
marvellous
insight
into
the
political
life
of
each
of
these
nations
bollati
the
italian
ambassador
was
a
great
admirer
of
germany
he
spoke
german
well
and
did
everything
possible
to
keep
italy
out
of
war
with
her
former
allies
in
the
triple
alliance
spain
was
represented
by
polo
de
bernabe
who
now
represents
the
interests
of
the
united
states
in
germany
as
well
as
those
of
france
russia
belgium
serbia
and
roumania
it
is
a
curious
commentary
on
the
absurdity
of
war
that
on
leaving
berlin
i
handed
over
the
interests
of
the
united
states
to
this
ambassador
who
as
spanish
minister
to
the
united
states
was
handed
his
passports
at
the
outbreak
of
the
war
i
am
sure
that
not
only
he
but
all
his
embassy
will
devotedly
represent
our
interests
in
germany
sverbeeu
represented
the
interests
of
russia
soughimoura
japan
and
mouktar
pascha
turkey
the
wife
of
the
latter
was
a
daughter
of
the
khedive
of
egypt
and
mouktar
pascha
himself
a
general
of
distinction
in
the
turkish
army
an
ambassador
must
keep
on
intimate
terms
with
his
colleagues
it
is
often
through
them
that
he
learns
of
important
matters
affecting
his
own
country
or
others
all
of
these
ambassadors
and
most
of
the
ministers
occupied
handsome
houses
furnished
by
their
government
they
had
large
salaries
and
a
fund
for
entertaining
during
this
first
winter
before
the
war
i
saw
a
great
deal
of
the
german
crown
prince
as
well
as
of
several
of
his
brothers
i
can
not
subscribe
to
the
general
opinion
of
the
crown
prince
i
found
him
a
most
agreeable
man
a
sharp
observer
and
the
possessor
of
intellectual
attainments
of
no
mean
order
he
is
undoubtedly
popular
in
germany
excelling
in
all
sports
a
fearless
rider
and
a
good
shot
he
is
ably
seconded
by
the
crown
princess
the
mother
of
the
crown
princess
is
a
russian
grand
duchess
and
her
father
was
a
duke
of
she
is
a
very
beautiful
woman
made
popular
by
her
affable
manners
the
one
defect
of
the
crown
prince
has
been
his
eagerness
for
war
but
as
he
has
characterised
this
war
as
the
most
stupid
ever
waged
in
history
perhaps
he
will
be
satisfied
if
he
comes
to
the
throne
with
what
all
germany
has
suffered
in
this
conflict
the
crown
prince
was
very
anxious
before
the
war
to
visit
the
united
states
and
we
had
practically
arranged
to
make
a
trip
to
alaska
in
search
of
some
of
the
big
game
there
with
stops
at
the
principal
cities
of
america
the
second
son
of
the
kaiser
prince
eitel
fritz
is
considered
by
the
germans
to
have
distinguished
himself
most
in
this
war
he
is
given
credit
for
great
personal
bravery
prince
adalbert
the
sailor
prince
is
quite
american
in
his
manners
in
february
the
crown
prince
and
princes
eitel
fritz
and
adalbert
came
to
our
embassy
for
a
very
small
dance
to
which
were
asked
all
the
pretty
american
girls
then
in
berlin
it
is
never
the
custom
to
invite
royalties
to
an
entertainment
they
invite
themselves
to
a
dance
or
a
dinner
and
the
list
of
proposed
guests
is
always
submitted
to
them
when
a
royalty
arrives
at
the
house
the
host
and
the
hostess
if
the
royalty
be
a
woman
always
waits
at
the
front
door
and
escorts
the
royalties
allison
armour
also
gave
a
dance
at
which
the
crown
prince
was
present
following
a
dinner
at
the
automobile
club
armour
has
been
a
constant
visitor
to
germany
for
many
years
usually
going
in
his
yacht
to
kiel
in
summer
and
to
corfu
where
the
emperor
goes
in
winter
as
he
has
never
tried
to
obtain
anything
from
the
emperor
he
has
become
quite
intimate
with
him
and
with
all
the
members
of
the
royal
family
the
chancellor
von
is
an
enormous
man
of
perhaps
six
feet
five
or
six
he
comes
of
a
banking
family
in
frankfort
it
is
too
soon
to
give
a
just
estimate
of
his
acts
in
this
war
when
i
arrived
in
berlin
and
until
november
von
jagow
was
minister
of
foreign
affairs
in
past
years
he
had
occupied
the
post
of
ambassador
to
italy
and
with
great
reluctance
took
his
place
at
the
head
of
the
foreign
office
zimmermann
was
an
under
secretary
succeeding
von
jagow
when
the
latter
was
practically
forced
out
of
office
zimmermann
on
account
of
his
plain
and
hearty
manners
and
democratic
air
was
more
of
a
favourite
with
the
ambassadors
and
members
of
the
reichstag
than
von
jagow
who
in
appearance
and
manner
was
the
ideal
diplomat
of
the
stage
von
jagow
was
not
a
good
speaker
and
the
agitation
against
him
was
started
by
those
who
claimed
that
in
answering
questions
in
the
reichstag
he
did
not
make
a
forceful
enough
appearance
on
behalf
of
the
government
von
jagow
did
not
cultivate
the
members
of
the
reichstag
and
his
delicate
health
prevented
him
from
undertaking
more
than
the
duties
of
his
office
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
believe
that
von
jagow
had
a
juster
estimate
of
foreign
nations
than
zimmermann
and
more
correctly
divined
the
thoughts
of
the
american
people
in
this
war
than
did
his
successor
i
thought
that
i
enjoyed
the
personal
friendship
of
both
von
jagow
and
zimmermann
and
therefore
was
rather
unpleasantly
surprised
when
i
saw
in
the
papers
that
zimmermann
had
stated
in
the
reichstag
that
he
had
been
compelled
from
motives
of
policy
to
keep
on
friendly
terms
with
me
i
sincerely
hope
that
what
he
said
on
this
occasion
was
incorrectly
reported
von
jagow
after
his
fall
took
charge
of
a
hospital
at
libau
in
the
occupied
portion
of
russia
this
shows
the
devotion
to
duty
of
the
prussian
noble
class
and
their
readiness
to
take
up
any
task
however
humble
that
may
help
their
country
chapter
ii
political
and
geographical
my
commission
read
ambassador
to
germany
it
is
characteristic
of
our
deep
ignorance
of
all
foreign
affairs
that
i
was
appointed
ambassador
to
a
place
which
does
not
exist
politically
there
is
no
such
place
as
germany
there
are
the
states
prussia
bavaria
württemberg
saxony
which
make
up
the
german
empire
but
there
is
no
such
political
entity
as
germany
these
states
have
votes
in
the
bundesrat
a
body
which
may
be
said
to
correspond
remotely
to
our
united
states
senate
but
each
state
has
a
different
number
of
votes
prussia
has
seventeen
bavaria
six
württemberg
and
saxony
four
each
baden
and
hesse
three
each
and
brunswick
two
each
and
the
rest
one
each
prussia
controls
brunswick
the
reichstag
or
imperial
parliament
corresponds
to
our
house
of
representatives
the
members
are
elected
by
manhood
suffrage
of
those
over
but
in
practice
the
reichstag
is
nothing
but
a
debating
society
because
of
the
preponderating
power
of
the
bundesrat
or
upper
chamber
at
the
head
of
the
ministry
is
the
chancellor
appointed
by
the
emperor
and
the
other
ministers
such
as
colonies
interior
education
justice
and
foreign
affairs
are
but
underlings
of
the
chancellor
and
appointed
by
him
the
chancellor
is
not
responsible
to
the
reichstag
as
clearly
stated
at
the
time
of
the
zabern
affair
but
only
to
the
emperor
it
is
true
that
an
innovation
properly
belonging
only
to
a
parliamentary
government
was
introduced
some
seven
years
ago
that
the
ministers
must
answer
questions
as
in
great
britain
put
them
by
the
members
of
the
reichstag
but
there
the
likeness
to
a
parliamentary
government
begins
and
ends
the
members
of
the
bundesrat
are
named
by
the
princes
of
the
states
making
up
the
german
empire
prussia
which
has
seventeen
votes
may
name
seventeen
members
of
the
bundesrat
or
one
member
who
however
when
he
votes
casts
seventeen
votes
the
votes
of
a
state
must
always
be
cast
as
a
unit
in
the
usual
procedure
bills
are
prepared
and
adopted
in
the
bundesrat
and
then
sent
to
the
reichstag
whence
if
passed
they
return
to
the
bundesrat
where
the
final
approval
must
take
place
therefore
in
practice
the
bundesrat
makes
the
laws
with
the
assent
of
the
reichstag
the
members
of
the
bundesrat
have
the
right
to
appear
and
make
speeches
in
the
reichstag
the
fundamental
constitution
of
the
german
empire
is
not
changed
as
with
us
by
a
separate
body
but
is
changed
in
the
same
way
that
an
ordinary
law
is
passed
except
that
if
there
are
fourteen
votes
against
the
proposed
change
in
the
bundesrat
the
proposition
is
defeated
and
further
the
constitution
can
not
be
changed
with
respect
to
rights
expressly
granted
by
it
to
anyone
of
the
states
without
the
assent
of
that
state
in
order
to
pass
a
law
a
majority
vote
in
the
bundesrat
and
reichstag
is
sufficient
if
there
is
a
quorum
present
and
a
quorum
is
a
majority
of
the
members
elected
in
the
reichstag
in
the
bundesrat
the
quorum
consists
of
such
members
as
are
present
at
a
regularly
called
meeting
providing
the
chancellor
or
the
attends
the
boundaries
of
the
districts
sending
members
to
the
reichstag
have
not
been
changed
since
while
in
the
meantime
a
great
shifting
of
population
as
well
as
great
increase
of
population
has
taken
place
and
because
of
this
the
reichstag
does
not
represent
the
people
of
germany
in
the
sense
intended
by
the
framers
of
the
imperial
constitution
much
of
the
legislation
that
affects
the
everyday
life
of
a
german
emanates
from
the
parliaments
of
prussia
bavaria
and
saxony
as
with
us
in
our
state
legislatures
the
purely
legislative
power
of
the
ministers
and
bundesrat
is
however
large
these
german
states
have
constitutions
of
some
sort
the
grand
duchies
of
mecklenburg
have
no
constitution
whatever
it
is
understood
that
the
people
themselves
do
not
want
one
on
financial
grounds
fearing
that
many
expenses
now
borne
by
the
grand
duke
out
of
his
large
private
income
would
be
saddled
on
the
people
the
other
states
have
constitutions
varying
in
form
in
prussia
there
are
a
house
of
lords
and
a
house
of
deputies
the
members
of
the
latter
are
elected
by
a
system
of
circle
votes
by
which
the
vote
of
one
rich
man
voting
in
circle
number
one
counts
as
much
as
thousands
voting
in
circle
number
three
it
is
the
recognition
by
that
this
vicious
system
must
be
changed
that
brought
down
on
him
the
wrath
of
the
prussian
country
squires
who
for
so
long
have
ruled
the
german
empire
filling
places
civil
and
military
with
their
children
and
relatives
in
considering
germany
the
immense
influence
of
the
military
party
must
not
be
left
out
of
account
and
with
the
developments
of
the
navy
that
branch
of
the
service
also
claimed
a
share
in
guiding
the
policy
of
the
government
the
administrative
executive
and
judicial
officers
of
prussia
are
not
elected
the
country
is
governed
and
judged
by
men
who
enter
this
branch
of
the
government
service
exactly
as
others
enter
the
army
or
navy
these
are
gradually
promoted
through
the
various
grades
this
applies
to
judges
clerks
of
courts
district
attorneys
and
the
officials
who
govern
the
political
divisions
of
prussia
for
prussia
is
divided
into
circles
presidencies
and
provinces
for
instance
a
young
man
may
enter
the
government
service
as
assistant
to
the
clerk
of
some
court
he
may
then
become
district
attorney
in
a
small
town
then
clerk
of
a
larger
court
possibly
attached
to
the
police
presidency
of
a
large
city
he
may
then
become
a
minor
judge
until
finally
he
becomes
a
judge
of
one
of
the
higher
courts
or
an
of
a
province
practically
the
only
elective
officers
who
have
any
power
are
members
of
the
reichstag
and
the
prussian
legislature
and
there
as
i
have
shown
the
power
is
very
small
mayors
and
city
councillors
are
elected
in
prussia
but
have
little
power
and
are
elected
by
the
vicious
system
of
circle
voting
time
and
again
during
the
course
of
the
great
war
when
i
made
some
complaint
or
request
affecting
the
interests
of
one
of
the
various
nations
i
represented
i
was
met
in
the
foreign
office
by
the
statement
we
can
do
nothing
with
the
military
please
read
bismarck
memoirs
and
you
will
see
what
difficulty
he
had
with
the
military
undoubtedly
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
chancellor
seldom
took
strong
ground
the
influence
which
both
the
army
and
navy
claimed
in
dictating
the
policy
of
the
empire
was
greatly
increased
roughly
speaking
there
are
three
great
political
divisions
or
parties
in
the
german
reichstag
to
the
right
of
the
presiding
officer
sit
the
conservatives
most
of
these
are
members
from
the
prussian
junker
or
squire
class
they
are
strong
for
the
rights
of
the
crown
and
against
any
extension
of
the
suffrage
in
prussia
or
anywhere
else
they
form
probably
the
most
important
body
of
conservatives
now
existing
in
any
country
in
the
world
their
leader
heydebrand
is
known
as
the
uncrowned
king
of
prussia
on
the
left
side
the
social
democrats
sit
as
they
evidently
oppose
the
kingship
and
favour
a
republic
no
social
democratic
member
has
ever
been
called
into
the
government
they
represent
the
great
industrial
populations
of
germany
roughly
they
constitute
about
of
the
reichstag
and
would
sit
there
in
greater
numbers
if
germany
were
again
redistricted
so
that
proper
representation
were
given
to
the
cities
to
which
there
has
been
a
great
rush
of
population
since
the
time
when
the
reichstag
districts
were
originally
constituted
in
the
centre
and
holding
the
balance
of
power
sit
the
members
of
the
centrum
or
catholic
body
among
them
are
many
priests
it
is
noteworthy
that
in
this
war
roman
catholic
opinion
in
neutral
countries
like
spain
inclines
to
the
side
of
germany
while
in
germany
to
protect
their
religious
liberties
the
catholic
population
vote
as
catholics
to
send
catholic
members
to
the
reichstag
and
these
sit
and
vote
as
catholics
alone
germans
high
in
rank
in
the
government
often
told
me
that
no
part
of
conquered
poland
would
ever
be
incorporated
in
prussia
or
the
empire
because
it
was
not
desirable
to
add
to
the
roman
catholic
population
that
they
had
troubles
enough
with
the
catholics
now
in
germany
and
had
no
desire
to
add
to
their
numbers
this
and
the
desire
to
lure
the
poles
into
the
creation
of
a
national
army
which
could
be
utilised
by
the
german
machine
were
the
reasons
for
the
creation
by
germany
with
the
assent
of
austria
of
the
new
country
of
poland
this
catholic
party
is
the
result
in
germany
of
the
or
war
for
civilisation
as
it
was
called
by
bismarck
a
contest
dating
from
between
the
state
in
germany
and
the
roman
catholic
church
prussia
has
always
been
the
centre
of
protestantism
in
germany
although
there
are
many
roman
catholics
in
the
rhine
provinces
of
prussia
and
in
that
part
of
prussia
inhabited
principally
by
poles
originally
part
of
the
kingdom
of
poland
baden
and
bavaria
the
two
principal
south
german
states
and
others
are
catholic
in
on
the
withdrawal
of
the
french
garrison
from
rome
the
temporal
power
of
the
pope
ended
and
bismarck
though
appealed
to
by
catholics
took
no
interest
in
the
defence
of
the
papacy
the
conflict
between
the
roman
catholics
and
the
government
in
germany
was
precipitated
by
the
promulgation
by
the
vatican
council
in
of
the
dogma
of
the
infallibility
of
the
pope
a
certain
number
of
german
pastors
and
bishops
refused
to
subscribe
to
the
new
dogma
in
the
conflict
that
ensued
these
pastors
and
bishops
were
backed
by
the
government
the
religious
orders
were
suppressed
civil
marriage
made
compulsory
and
the
state
assumed
new
powers
not
only
in
the
appointment
but
even
in
the
education
of
the
catholic
priests
the
jesuits
were
expelled
from
germany
in
these
measures
generally
known
as
the
may
laws
because
passed
in
may
and
led
to
the
creation
and
strengthening
of
the
centrum
or
catholic
party
for
a
long
period
many
churches
were
vacant
in
prussia
finally
owing
to
the
growth
of
the
centrum
bismarck
gave
in
the
may
laws
were
rescinded
in
and
the
religious
orders
the
jesuits
excepted
were
permitted
to
return
in
civil
marriage
however
remained
obligatory
in
prussia
ever
since
the
the
centrum
has
held
the
balance
of
power
in
germany
acting
sometimes
with
the
conservatives
and
sometimes
with
the
social
democrats
in
addition
to
these
three
great
parties
there
are
minor
parties
and
groups
which
sometimes
act
with
one
party
and
sometimes
with
another
the
national
liberals
for
example
and
the
progressives
since
the
war
certain
members
of
the
national
liberal
party
were
most
bitter
in
assailing
president
wilson
and
the
united
states
in
the
demand
for
ruthless
submarine
war
they
acted
with
the
conservatives
there
are
also
polish
hanoverian
danish
and
alsatian
members
of
the
reichstag
there
are
three
great
race
questions
in
germany
first
of
all
that
of
it
is
unnecessary
to
go
at
length
into
this
question
in
the
chapter
on
the
affair
at
zabern
something
will
be
seen
of
the
attitude
of
the
troops
toward
the
civil
population
at
the
outbreak
of
the
war
several
of
the
deputies
sitting
in
the
reichstag
as
members
from
crossed
the
frontier
and
joined
the
french
army
if
there
is
one
talent
which
the
germans
superlatively
lack
it
is
that
of
ruling
over
other
peoples
and
inducing
other
people
to
become
part
of
their
nation
it
is
now
a
long
time
since
portions
of
the
kingdom
of
poland
by
various
partitions
of
that
kingdom
were
incorporated
with
prussia
but
the
polish
question
is
more
alive
than
at
the
time
of
the
last
partition
the
poles
are
of
a
livelier
race
than
the
germans
are
roman
catholics
and
always
retain
their
dream
of
a
reconstituted
and
independent
kingdom
of
poland
it
is
hard
to
conceive
that
poland
was
at
one
time
perhaps
the
most
powerful
kingdom
of
europe
with
a
population
numbering
twenty
millions
and
extending
from
the
baltic
to
the
carpathians
and
the
black
sea
including
in
its
territory
the
basins
of
the
warta
vistula
dwina
dnieper
and
upper
dniester
and
that
it
had
under
its
dominion
besides
poles
proper
and
the
baltic
slavs
the
lithuanians
the
white
russians
and
the
little
russians
or
ruthenians
the
polish
aristocracy
was
absolutely
incapable
of
governing
its
own
country
which
fell
an
easy
prey
to
the
intrigues
of
frederick
the
great
and
the
two
empresses
maria
theresa
of
austria
and
catherine
of
russia
the
last
partition
of
poland
was
in
the
year
posen
at
one
time
one
of
the
capitals
of
the
old
kingdom
of
poland
is
the
intellectual
centre
of
that
part
of
poland
which
has
been
incorporated
into
prussia
for
years
prussia
has
alternately
cajoled
and
oppressed
the
poles
and
has
made
every
endeavour
to
replace
the
polish
inhabitants
with
german
colonists
a
commission
has
been
established
which
buys
estates
from
poles
and
sells
them
to
germans
this
commission
has
the
power
of
condemning
the
lands
of
poles
taking
these
lands
from
them
by
force
compensating
them
at
a
rate
determined
by
the
commission
and
settling
germans
on
the
lands
so
seized
this
commission
has
its
headquarters
in
posen
the
result
has
not
been
successful
all
the
country
side
surrounding
posen
and
the
city
itself
are
divided
into
two
factions
by
going
to
one
hotel
or
the
other
you
announce
that
you
are
or
poles
will
not
deal
in
shops
kept
by
germans
or
in
shops
unless
the
signs
are
in
polish
the
sons
of
germans
who
have
settled
in
poland
under
the
protection
of
the
commission
often
marry
polish
women
the
invariable
result
of
these
mixed
marriages
is
that
the
children
are
catholics
and
poles
polish
deputies
voting
as
poles
sit
in
the
prussian
legislature
and
in
the
reichstag
and
if
a
portion
of
the
old
kingdom
of
poland
is
made
a
separate
country
at
the
end
of
this
war
it
will
have
the
effect
of
making
the
poles
in
prussia
more
restless
and
more
aggressive
than
ever
in
order
to
win
the
sympathies
of
the
poles
the
emperor
caused
a
royal
castle
to
be
built
within
recent
years
in
the
city
of
posen
and
appointed
a
popular
polish
gentleman
who
had
served
in
the
prussian
army
and
was
attached
to
the
emperor
the
count
as
its
in
this
castle
was
a
very
beautiful
byzantine
chapel
built
from
designs
especially
selected
by
the
emperor
in
january
we
went
with
allison
armour
and
the
cassatts
wiltsee
and
whitehouse
on
a
trip
to
posen
to
see
this
chapel
some
of
our
german
friends
tried
to
play
a
joke
on
us
by
telling
us
that
the
best
hotel
was
the
hotel
patronised
by
the
poles
to
have
gone
there
would
have
been
to
declare
ourselves
and
but
we
were
warned
in
time
the
castle
has
a
large
throne
room
and
in
the
hall
is
a
stuffed
aurochs
killed
by
the
emperor
the
aurochs
is
a
species
of
buffalo
greatly
resembling
those
which
used
to
roam
our
western
prairies
the
breed
has
been
preserved
on
certain
great
estates
in
eastern
germany
and
in
the
hunting
forests
of
the
czar
in
the
neighbourhood
of
warsaw
some
of
the
poles
told
me
that
at
the
first
attempt
to
give
a
court
ball
in
this
new
castle
the
polish
population
in
the
streets
threw
ink
through
the
carriage
windows
on
the
dresses
of
the
ladies
going
to
the
ball
and
thus
made
it
a
failure
the
chapel
of
the
castle
is
very
beautiful
and
is
a
great
credit
to
the
emperor
taste
as
an
architect
while
being
shown
through
the
emperor
private
apartments
in
this
castle
i
noticed
a
saddle
on
a
sort
of
elevated
stool
in
front
of
a
desk
i
asked
the
guide
what
this
was
for
he
told
me
that
the
emperor
when
working
always
sits
in
a
saddle
in
posen
in
a
the
proprietor
brought
out
for
me
a
number
of
books
caricaturing
the
german
rule
of
it
is
curious
that
a
community
of
interests
should
make
a
market
for
these
books
in
polish
posen
although
not
so
well
advertised
the
polish
question
is
as
acute
as
that
of
after
its
successful
war
in
against
austria
bavaria
saxony
baden
hanover
prussia
became
possessed
of
the
two
duchies
of
which
are
to
the
south
of
denmark
on
the
jutland
peninsula
here
strangely
enough
there
is
a
danish
question
a
number
of
danes
inhabit
these
duchies
and
have
been
irritated
by
the
prussian
officials
and
officers
into
preserving
their
national
feeling
intact
ever
since
galling
restrictions
have
been
made
the
very
existence
of
which
intensifies
the
hatred
and
prevents
the
assimilation
of
these
danes
for
instance
amundsen
the
arctic
explorer
was
forbidden
to
lecture
in
danish
in
these
duchies
during
the
winter
of
and
there
were
regulations
enforced
preventing
more
than
a
certain
number
of
these
danish
people
from
assembling
in
a
hotel
as
well
as
regulations
against
the
employment
of
danish
servants
in
after
its
successful
war
prussia
wiped
out
the
old
kingdom
of
hanover
and
drove
its
king
into
exile
in
austria
there
is
still
a
party
of
protest
against
this
aggression
the
kaiser
believes
however
that
the
ghost
of
the
claim
of
the
kings
of
hanover
was
laid
when
he
married
his
only
daughter
to
the
heir
of
the
house
of
hanover
and
gave
the
young
pair
the
vacant
duchy
of
brunswick
that
this
young
man
will
inherit
the
great
guelph
treasure
was
no
drawback
to
the
match
in
the
eyes
of
those
in
berlin
there
is
a
hatred
of
prussia
in
other
parts
of
germany
but
coupled
with
so
much
fear
that
it
will
never
take
practical
shape
in
bavaria
for
example
even
the
comic
newspapers
have
for
years
ridiculed
the
prussians
and
the
house
of
hohenzollern
the
smashing
defeat
by
prussia
of
austria
and
the
allied
german
states
bavaria
saxony
hesse
hanover
in
and
the
growth
of
prussianism
since
then
in
all
of
these
countries
keep
the
people
from
any
overt
act
it
is
a
question
perhaps
as
to
how
these
countries
especially
bavaria
would
act
in
case
of
the
utter
defeat
of
germany
but
at
present
they
must
be
counted
on
only
as
faithful
servants
in
a
military
way
of
the
german
emperor
montesquieu
the
author
of
the
esprit
des
lois
says
all
law
comes
from
the
soil
and
it
has
been
claimed
that
residence
in
the
hot
climate
of
the
tropics
in
some
measure
changes
character
it
is
therefore
always
well
in
judging
national
character
to
know
something
of
the
physical
characteristics
and
climate
of
the
country
which
a
nation
inhabits
the
heart
of
modern
germany
is
the
great
north
central
plain
which
comprises
practically
all
of
the
original
kingdom
of
prussia
stretching
northward
from
the
saxon
and
hartz
mountains
to
the
north
and
baltic
seas
it
is
from
this
dreary
and
infertile
plain
that
for
many
centuries
conquering
military
races
have
poured
over
europe
the
climate
is
not
so
cold
in
winter
as
that
of
the
northern
part
of
the
united
states
there
is
much
rain
and
the
winter
skies
are
so
dark
that
the
absence
of
the
sun
must
have
some
effect
upon
the
character
of
the
people
the
saxons
inhabit
a
more
mountainous
country
württemberg
and
baden
are
hilly
bavaria
is
a
land
of
beauty
diversified
with
lovely
lakes
and
mountains
the
soft
outlines
of
the
hills
of
the
rhine
valley
have
long
been
the
admiration
of
travellers
the
inhabitants
of
prussia
were
originally
not
germanic
but
rather
slavish
in
type
and
indeed
in
the
forest
of
the
river
spree
on
which
berlin
is
situated
and
only
about
fifty
miles
from
that
city
there
still
dwell
descendants
of
the
original
wendish
inhabitants
of
the
country
who
speak
the
wendish
language
the
whose
picturesque
dress
is
so
noticeable
on
the
streets
of
berlin
all
come
from
this
wendish
colony
which
has
been
preserved
through
the
many
wars
that
have
swept
over
this
part
of
germany
because
of
the
refuge
afforded
in
the
swamps
and
forests
of
this
district
the
inhabitants
of
the
rhine
valley
drink
wine
instead
of
beer
they
are
more
lively
in
their
disposition
than
the
prussians
saxons
and
bavarians
who
are
of
a
heavy
and
phlegmatic
nature
the
bavarians
are
noted
for
their
prowess
as
beer
drinkers
and
it
is
not
at
all
unusual
for
prosperous
burghers
of
munich
to
dispose
of
thirty
large
glasses
of
beer
in
a
day
hence
the
cures
which
exist
all
over
germany
and
where
the
average
german
business
man
spends
part
at
least
of
his
annual
vacation
in
peace
times
the
germans
are
heavy
eaters
as
some
one
says
it
is
not
true
that
the
germans
eat
all
the
time
but
they
eat
all
the
time
except
during
seven
periods
of
the
day
when
they
take
their
meals
and
it
is
a
fact
that
prosperous
merchants
of
berlin
before
the
war
had
seven
meals
a
day
first
breakfast
at
a
comfortably
early
hour
second
breakfast
at
about
eleven
of
perhaps
a
glass
of
milk
or
perhaps
a
glass
of
beer
and
sandwiches
a
very
heavy
lunch
of
four
or
five
courses
with
wine
and
beer
coffee
and
cakes
at
three
tea
and
sandwiches
or
sandwiches
and
beer
at
about
five
a
strong
dinner
with
several
kinds
of
wines
at
about
seven
or
and
a
substantial
supper
before
going
to
bed
the
germans
are
wonderful
judges
of
wines
and
at
any
formal
dinner
use
as
many
as
eight
varieties
the
best
wine
is
passed
in
glasses
on
trays
and
the
guests
are
not
expected
of
course
to
take
this
wine
unless
they
actually
desire
to
drink
it
i
know
one
american
woman
who
was
stopping
at
a
prince
castle
in
hungary
and
who
on
the
first
night
allowed
the
butler
to
fill
her
glasses
with
wine
which
she
did
not
drink
the
second
evening
the
butler
passed
her
sternly
by
and
she
was
offered
no
more
wine
during
her
stay
in
the
castle
many
of
the
doctors
who
were
with
me
thought
that
the
heavy
eating
and
large
consumption
of
wine
and
beer
had
unfavourably
affected
the
german
national
character
and
had
made
the
people
more
aggressive
and
irritable
and
consequently
readier
for
war
the
influence
of
diet
on
national
character
should
not
be
nations
have
always
ruled
vegetarians
chapter
iii
diplomatic
work
of
first
winter
in
berlin
during
this
first
winter
in
berlin
i
spent
each
morning
in
the
embassy
office
and
if
i
had
any
business
at
the
foreign
office
called
there
about
five
in
the
afternoon
it
was
the
custom
that
all
ambassadors
should
call
on
tuesday
afternoons
at
the
foreign
office
going
in
to
see
the
foreign
minister
in
the
order
of
their
arrival
in
the
and
to
have
a
short
talk
with
him
about
current
diplomatic
affairs
in
the
previous
chapter
i
have
given
a
detailed
account
of
the
ceremonies
of
court
life
because
a
knowledge
of
this
life
is
essential
to
a
grasp
of
the
spirit
which
animates
those
ruling
the
destinies
of
the
german
empire
my
first
winter
however
was
not
all
cakes
and
ale
there
were
several
interesting
bits
of
diplomatic
work
first
we
were
then
engaged
in
our
conflict
with
huerta
the
dictator
of
mexico
and
it
was
part
of
my
work
to
secure
from
germany
promises
that
she
would
not
recognise
this
mexican
president
i
also
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
in
endeavouring
to
get
the
german
government
to
take
part
officially
in
the
san
francisco
fair
but
so
far
as
i
could
make
out
great
britain
probably
at
the
instance
of
germany
seemed
to
have
entered
into
some
sort
of
agreement
or
at
any
rate
a
tacit
understanding
that
neither
country
would
participate
officially
in
this
exposition
after
the
lamentable
failure
of
the
jamestown
exposition
the
countries
of
europe
were
certainly
not
to
be
blamed
for
not
spending
their
money
in
aid
of
a
similar
enterprise
but
i
believe
that
the
attitude
of
germany
had
a
deeper
significance
and
that
certain
at
least
of
the
german
statesmen
had
contemplated
a
with
great
britain
and
a
mutual
spanking
of
america
and
its
monroe
doctrine
by
these
two
great
powers
later
i
was
informed
by
a
man
high
in
the
german
foreign
office
that
germany
had
proposed
to
great
britain
a
joint
intervention
in
mexico
an
invasion
which
would
have
put
an
end
forever
to
the
monroe
doctrine
of
course
to
be
followed
by
the
forceful
colonisation
of
central
and
south
america
by
european
powers
i
was
told
that
great
britain
refused
but
whether
this
proposition
and
refusal
in
fact
were
made
can
be
learned
from
the
archives
of
the
british
foreign
office
during
this
period
of
trouble
with
mexico
the
german
press
almost
without
exception
and
especially
that
part
of
it
controlled
by
the
government
and
by
the
conservatives
or
junkers
was
most
bitter
in
its
attitude
towards
america
the
reason
for
this
was
the
underlying
hatred
of
an
autocracy
for
a
successful
democracy
envy
of
the
wealth
liberty
and
commercial
success
of
america
and
a
deep
and
strong
resentment
against
the
monroe
doctrine
which
prevented
germany
from
using
her
powerful
fleet
and
great
military
force
to
seize
a
foothold
in
the
western
hemisphere
germany
came
late
into
the
field
of
colonisation
in
her
endeavour
to
find
a
place
in
the
sun
the
colonies
secured
were
not
habitable
by
white
men
togo
kameroons
german
east
africa
are
too
tropical
in
climate
too
subject
to
tropical
diseases
ever
to
become
successful
german
colonies
german
southwest
africa
has
a
more
healthy
climate
but
is
a
barren
land
about
the
only
successful
industry
there
has
been
that
of
gathering
the
small
diamonds
that
were
discovered
in
the
sands
of
the
beaches
and
of
the
deserts
running
back
from
the
sea
on
the
earnest
request
of
secretary
bryan
i
endeavoured
to
persuade
the
german
authorities
to
have
germany
become
a
signatory
to
the
bryan
peace
treaties
after
many
efforts
and
long
interviews
von
jagow
the
foreign
minister
finally
told
me
that
germany
would
not
sign
these
treaties
because
the
greatest
asset
of
germany
in
war
was
her
readiness
for
a
sudden
assault
that
they
had
no
objection
to
signing
the
treaty
with
america
but
that
they
feared
they
would
then
be
immediately
asked
to
sign
similar
treaties
with
great
britain
france
and
russia
that
if
they
refused
to
sign
with
these
countries
the
refusal
would
almost
be
equivalent
to
a
declaration
of
war
and
if
they
did
sign
intending
in
good
faith
to
stand
by
the
treaty
that
germany
would
be
deprived
of
her
greatest
asset
in
war
namely
her
readiness
for
a
sudden
and
overpowering
attack
i
also
during
this
first
winter
studied
and
made
reports
on
the
commercial
situation
of
germany
and
especially
the
german
discriminations
against
american
goods
to
these
matters
i
shall
refer
in
more
detail
in
another
chapter
opposition
and
attention
to
the
oil
monopoly
project
also
occupied
a
great
part
of
my
working
hours
petroleum
is
used
very
extensively
in
germany
for
illuminating
purposes
by
the
poorer
part
of
the
population
especially
in
the
farming
villages
and
industrial
towns
this
oil
used
in
germany
comes
from
two
sources
of
supply
from
america
and
from
the
oil
wells
of
galicia
and
roumania
the
german
american
oil
company
there
through
which
the
american
oil
was
distributed
although
a
german
company
was
controlled
by
american
capital
and
german
capital
was
largely
interested
in
the
galician
and
roumanian
oil
fields
the
oil
from
galicia
and
roumania
is
not
so
good
a
quality
as
that
imported
from
america
illustration
programme
of
the
music
after
dinner
with
the
kaiser
at
the
royal
palace
berlin
before
my
arrival
in
germany
the
government
had
proposed
a
law
creating
the
oil
monopoly
that
is
to
say
a
company
was
to
be
created
controlled
by
the
government
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
on
the
entire
oil
business
of
germany
and
no
other
person
or
company
by
its
provisions
was
to
be
allowed
to
sell
any
illuminating
oil
or
similar
products
in
the
empire
the
bill
provided
that
the
business
of
those
engaged
in
the
wholesale
selling
of
oil
and
their
plants
should
be
taken
over
by
this
government
company
condemned
and
paid
for
the
german
american
company
however
had
also
a
retail
business
and
plant
throughout
germany
for
which
it
was
proposed
that
no
compensation
should
be
given
the
government
bill
also
contained
certain
curious
jokers
for
instance
it
provided
for
the
taking
over
of
all
plants
within
the
customs
limit
of
the
german
empire
thus
leaving
out
of
the
compensation
a
refinery
which
was
situated
in
the
free
part
of
hamburg
although
of
course
by
operation
of
this
monopoly
bill
the
refinery
was
rendered
useless
to
the
american
controlled
company
which
owned
it
in
the
course
of
this
investigation
it
came
to
light
that
the
prussian
state
railways
were
used
as
a
means
of
discriminating
against
the
american
oil
american
oil
came
to
germany
through
the
port
of
hamburg
and
the
galician
and
roumanian
oil
through
the
frontier
town
of
oderberg
taking
a
delivery
point
equally
distant
between
oderberg
and
hamburg
the
rate
charged
on
oil
from
hamburg
to
this
point
was
twice
as
great
as
that
charged
for
a
similar
quantity
of
oil
from
oderberg
i
took
up
this
fight
on
the
line
that
the
company
must
be
compensated
for
all
of
its
property
that
used
in
retail
as
well
as
in
wholesale
business
and
second
that
it
must
be
compensated
for
the
of
its
business
which
it
had
built
up
through
a
number
of
years
by
the
expenditure
of
very
large
sums
of
money
of
course
where
a
company
has
been
in
operation
for
years
and
is
continually
advertising
its
business
its
often
is
its
greatest
asset
and
has
often
been
built
up
by
the
greatest
expenditure
of
money
for
instance
in
buying
a
successful
newspaper
the
value
does
not
lie
in
the
presses
but
in
the
of
the
newspaper
the
result
of
years
of
work
and
expensive
advertising
i
made
no
objection
that
the
german
government
did
not
have
a
perfect
right
to
create
this
monopoly
and
to
put
the
american
controlled
company
entirely
out
of
the
field
but
insisted
upon
a
fair
compensation
for
all
their
property
and
even
a
fair
compensation
for
the
property
and
would
have
started
the
government
monopoly
company
with
a
large
debt
upon
which
it
would
have
been
required
to
pay
interest
and
this
interest
of
course
would
have
been
added
to
the
cost
of
oil
to
the
german
consumers
in
my
final
conversation
on
the
subject
with
von
he
said
you
do
mean
to
say
that
president
wilson
and
secretary
bryan
will
do
anything
for
the
standard
oil
company
i
answered
that
everyone
in
america
knew
that
the
standard
oil
company
had
neither
influence
with
nor
control
over
president
wilson
and
secretary
bryan
but
that
they
both
could
and
would
give
the
standard
oil
company
the
same
measure
of
protection
which
any
american
citizen
doing
business
abroad
had
a
right
to
expect
from
his
government
i
also
said
that
i
thought
they
had
done
enough
for
the
germans
interested
in
the
galician
and
roumanian
oil
fields
when
they
had
used
the
prussian
state
railways
to
give
these
oil
producers
an
unfair
advantage
over
those
importing
american
oil
shortly
after
this
the
question
of
the
creation
of
this
oil
monopoly
was
dropped
and
naturally
has
not
been
revived
during
the
war
and
i
very
much
doubt
whether
after
the
war
the
people
of
liberalised
germany
will
consent
to
pay
more
for
inferior
oil
in
order
to
make
good
the
investments
of
certain
german
banks
and
financiers
in
galicia
and
roumania
i
doubt
whether
a
more
liberal
germany
will
wish
to
put
the
control
of
a
great
business
in
the
hands
of
the
government
thereby
greatly
increasing
the
number
of
government
officials
and
the
weight
of
government
influence
in
the
country
heaven
knows
there
are
officials
enough
in
germany
without
turning
over
a
great
department
of
private
industry
to
the
government
for
the
sole
purpose
of
making
good
bad
investments
of
certain
financiers
and
adding
to
the
political
influence
of
the
central
government
in
may
colonel
house
and
his
beautiful
wife
arrived
to
pay
us
a
visit
in
berlin
he
was
of
course
anxious
to
have
a
talk
with
the
emperor
and
this
was
arranged
by
the
emperor
inviting
the
colonel
and
me
to
what
is
called
the
at
the
new
palace
at
potsdam
for
many
years
in
fact
since
the
days
of
frederick
the
great
the
learning
battalion
composed
of
picked
soldiers
from
all
the
regiments
of
prussia
has
been
quartered
at
potsdam
and
on
a
certain
day
in
april
this
battalion
has
been
given
a
dinner
at
which
they
eat
white
rolls
instead
of
the
usual
black
bread
this
feast
has
been
carried
on
from
these
older
days
and
has
become
quite
a
ceremony
the
colonel
and
i
motored
to
potsdam
arrayed
in
and
waited
in
one
of
the
salons
of
the
ground
floor
of
the
new
palace
finally
the
emperor
and
the
empress
and
several
of
the
princes
and
their
wives
and
the
usual
dignitaries
of
the
emperor
household
arrived
the
colonel
was
presented
to
the
royalties
and
then
a
divine
service
was
held
in
the
open
air
at
one
end
of
the
palace
the
empress
and
princesses
occupied
large
chairs
and
the
emperor
stood
with
his
sons
behind
him
and
then
the
various
dignitaries
of
the
court
the
lehr
battalion
was
drawn
up
behind
there
were
a
large
band
and
the
choir
boys
from
the
berlin
cathedral
the
service
was
very
impressive
and
not
less
so
because
of
a
great
zeppelin
which
hovered
over
our
heads
during
the
whole
of
the
service
after
divine
service
the
lehr
battalion
marched
in
review
and
then
was
given
food
and
beer
in
long
arbours
constructed
in
front
of
the
palace
while
the
men
were
eating
the
emperor
and
empress
and
princes
passed
among
the
tables
speaking
to
the
soldiers
we
then
went
to
the
new
palace
where
in
the
extraordinary
hall
studded
with
curious
specimens
of
minerals
from
all
countries
a
long
table
forming
three
sides
of
a
square
was
set
for
about
sixty
people
colonel
house
and
i
sat
directly
across
the
table
from
the
emperor
with
general
falkenhayn
between
us
the
emperor
was
in
a
very
good
mood
and
at
one
time
talking
across
the
table
said
to
me
that
the
colonel
and
i
in
our
black
looked
like
a
couple
of
crows
that
we
were
like
two
undertakers
at
a
feast
and
spoiled
the
picture
after
luncheon
the
emperor
had
a
long
talk
with
colonel
house
and
then
called
me
into
the
conversation
on
may
i
arranged
that
the
colonel
should
meet
von
tirpitz
at
dinner
in
our
house
we
did
not
guess
then
what
a
central
figure
in
this
war
the
great
admiral
was
going
to
be
at
that
time
and
until
his
fall
he
was
minister
of
marine
which
corresponds
to
our
secretary
of
the
navy
department
and
what
is
called
in
german
the
colonel
also
met
the
chancellor
von
jagow
zimmermann
and
many
others
there
are
two
other
heads
of
departments
connected
with
the
navy
of
equal
rank
with
the
secretary
of
the
naval
department
and
not
reporting
to
him
these
are
the
heads
of
the
naval
staff
and
the
head
of
what
is
known
as
the
marine
cabinet
the
head
of
the
naval
staff
is
supposed
to
direct
the
actual
operations
of
warfare
in
the
navy
and
the
head
of
the
marine
cabinet
is
charged
with
the
personnel
of
the
navy
with
determining
what
officers
are
to
be
promoted
and
what
officers
are
to
take
over
ships
or
commands
while
von
tirpitz
was
secretary
of
the
navy
by
the
force
of
his
personality
he
dominated
the
two
other
departments
but
since
his
fall
the
heads
of
these
two
other
departments
have
held
positions
as
important
if
not
more
important
than
that
of
secretary
of
the
navy
on
may
we
took
colonel
and
house
to
the
aviation
field
of
joachimsthal
here
the
dutch
aviator
fokker
was
flying
and
after
being
introduced
to
us
he
did
some
stunts
for
our
benefit
fokker
was
employed
by
the
german
army
and
later
became
a
naturalised
german
the
machines
designed
by
him
and
named
after
him
for
a
long
time
held
the
mastery
of
the
air
on
the
west
front
the
advice
of
colonel
house
a
most
wise
and
prudent
counsellor
was
at
all
times
of
the
greatest
value
to
me
during
my
stay
in
berlin
we
exchanged
letters
weekly
i
sending
him
a
weekly
bulletin
of
the
situation
in
berlin
and
much
news
and
gossip
too
personal
or
too
indefinite
to
be
placed
in
official
reports
war
with
germany
seemed
a
thing
not
even
to
be
considered
when
in
this
month
of
may
i
called
on
the
foreign
office
by
direction
to
thank
the
imperial
government
for
the
aid
given
the
americans
at
tampico
by
german
ships
of
war
early
in
february
bergmann
a
german
who
had
made
a
fortune
in
america
and
who
had
returned
to
germany
to
take
up
again
his
german
citizenship
invited
me
to
go
over
the
great
electrical
works
which
he
had
established
prince
henry
of
prussia
the
brother
of
the
emperor
was
the
only
other
guest
and
together
we
inspected
the
vast
works
afterwards
having
lunch
in
bergmann
office
prince
henry
has
always
been
interested
in
america
since
his
visit
here
on
that
visit
he
spent
most
of
his
time
with
german
societies
etc
of
course
now
we
know
he
came
as
a
propagandist
with
the
object
of
welding
together
the
germans
in
america
and
keeping
up
their
interest
in
the
fatherland
he
made
a
similar
trip
to
the
argentine
just
before
the
great
war
with
a
similar
purpose
but
i
understand
his
excursion
was
not
considered
a
great
success
from
any
standpoint
a
man
of
affable
manners
no
one
is
better
qualified
to
go
abroad
as
a
german
propagandist
than
he
if
all
germans
had
been
like
him
there
would
have
been
no
world
war
in
on
march
eighteenth
we
were
invited
to
a
ball
at
the
palace
of
the
crown
prince
the
guests
were
mostly
young
people
and
officers
the
crown
princess
wore
a
beautiful
russian
dress
with
its
characteristic
high
front
piece
on
the
head
the
crown
prince
and
all
the
officers
present
were
in
the
picturesque
uniforms
of
their
respective
regiments
of
a
period
of
one
hundred
years
ago
prince
oscar
the
fifth
son
of
the
kaiser
looked
particularly
well
the
hours
for
balls
in
berlin
where
officers
attended
were
a
good
example
for
hostesses
in
this
country
the
invitations
read
for
eight
and
that
meant
eight
a
cold
dinner
of
perhaps
four
courses
is
immediately
served
on
the
arrival
of
the
guests
who
with
the
exception
of
a
very
few
distinguished
ones
are
not
given
any
particular
places
at
a
quarter
to
nine
the
dancing
begins
supper
is
at
about
eleven
and
the
guests
go
home
at
twelve
at
an
hour
which
enables
the
officers
to
get
to
bed
early
during
the
season
there
were
balls
at
the
british
and
french
embassy
and
performances
by
the
russian
ballet
then
in
berlin
at
the
russian
embassy
the
wonderful
new
royal
library
designed
by
ihne
was
opened
on
march
the
emperor
attended
coming
in
with
the
beautiful
queen
of
roumania
walking
by
his
side
she
is
an
exceedingly
handsome
woman
half
english
and
half
russian
some
days
later
i
was
presented
to
her
at
a
reception
held
at
the
roumanian
minister
and
found
her
as
pleasant
to
talk
to
as
good
to
look
upon
at
the
end
of
march
there
was
a
horse
show
the
horses
did
not
get
prizes
for
mere
looks
and
manners
in
trotting
and
cantering
as
here
they
must
all
do
something
for
the
horse
is
considered
primarily
as
a
war
horse
such
for
instance
as
stopping
suddenly
and
turning
at
a
word
of
command
the
jumping
was
excellent
officers
riding
in
all
the
events
it
was
not
a
function
of
society
but
all
society
was
there
and
most
keenly
interested
for
in
a
warlike
country
just
as
in
the
middle
ages
the
life
may
depend
upon
the
qualities
of
his
horse
i
have
always
been
fond
of
horses
and
and
the
about
berlin
were
always
an
attraction
for
me
many
of
the
drivers
and
jockeys
were
americans
taral
was
a
successful
jockey
for
my
marcus
daly
he
is
the
trainer
of
one
of
the
best
racing
stables
in
germany
that
of
the
brothers
weinberg
who
made
a
fortune
in
pop
campbell
who
trained
daly
ogden
a
futurity
winner
is
also
a
berlin
trainer
the
top
notch
jockey
was
archibald
of
california
mccreery
who
once
trained
for
one
of
my
brothers
had
the
stable
which
rivalled
the
weinbergs
that
of
baron
oppenheim
a
rich
banker
of
cologne
the
german
officers
are
splendid
riders
and
take
part
in
many
races
the
crown
prince
himself
is
a
successful
jockey
and
racing
stable
owner
on
june
fifth
at
the
annual
hunt
race
the
big
steeplechase
of
the
year
the
emperor
himself
appeared
at
the
grünewald
track
occupying
his
private
box
a
sort
of
little
house
beyond
the
finish
bookmakers
are
not
allowed
in
germany
the
betting
is
in
mutual
pools
about
seventeen
per
cent
of
the
money
paid
is
taken
by
the
jockey
club
the
state
and
charities
so
that
the
bettor
with
this
percentage
running
always
against
him
has
little
chance
of
ultimate
success
many
of
the
races
are
confined
to
horses
bred
in
denmark
and
the
central
empires
all
of
us
in
the
embassy
joined
the
red
white
tennis
club
situated
in
the
grünewald
about
five
miles
from
the
centre
of
berlin
the
crown
prince
was
a
member
and
often
played
there
he
is
an
excellent
player
not
quite
up
to
championship
form
but
he
can
give
a
good
account
of
himself
in
any
company
short
of
the
top
class
he
has
the
advantage
of
always
finding
that
the
best
players
are
only
too
glad
to
have
an
opportunity
to
play
with
him
at
this
tennis
club
during
all
the
period
of
the
feeling
of
hatred
against
america
we
were
treated
with
extreme
courtesy
by
all
our
german
fellow
members
we
saw
a
great
deal
of
the
two
exchange
professors
in
the
winter
of
professor
paul
shorey
of
the
university
of
chicago
and
professor
archibald
coolidge
of
harvard
these
exchange
professors
give
courses
and
lectures
in
the
universities
and
their
first
appearance
is
quite
an
event
on
this
first
day
in
they
each
delivered
a
lecture
in
the
university
of
berlin
and
on
this
lecture
day
prince
august
wilhelm
representing
the
kaiser
attended
the
kaiser
used
invariably
to
attend
but
of
late
years
i
am
afraid
has
rather
lost
interest
in
this
enterprise
at
first
so
much
favoured
by
him
the
at
one
time
after
the
commencement
of
the
war
in
an
article
expressed
great
surprise
that
america
should
permit
the
export
of
munitions
of
war
to
the
allies
and
said
quite
seriously
that
germany
had
done
everything
possible
to
win
the
favour
of
america
that
roosevelt
had
been
offered
a
review
of
german
troops
that
the
emperor
had
invited
americans
who
came
to
kiel
on
their
yachts
to
dine
with
him
and
that
he
had
even
sat
through
the
lectures
given
by
american
exchange
professors
before
the
war
there
was
but
one
cable
direct
from
germany
to
america
this
cable
was
owned
by
a
german
company
and
reached
america
via
the
azore
islands
i
endeavoured
to
obtain
permission
for
the
western
union
company
to
land
a
cable
in
germany
but
the
opposition
of
the
german
company
which
did
not
desire
to
have
its
monopoly
interfered
with
caused
the
applications
of
the
western
union
to
be
definitely
in
august
after
the
outbreak
of
the
war
when
i
told
this
to
ballin
of
the
hamburg
american
line
and
von
gwinner
head
of
the
deutsche
bank
and
when
they
thought
of
how
much
they
could
have
saved
for
themselves
and
germany
and
their
companies
if
there
had
been
an
american
owned
cable
landing
in
germany
their
anger
at
the
delay
on
the
part
of
official
germany
knew
no
bounds
within
a
very
short
time
i
received
an
answer
from
the
foreign
office
granting
the
application
of
the
western
union
company
providing
the
cable
went
direct
to
america
this
concession
however
came
too
late
and
naturally
the
western
union
did
not
take
up
the
matter
during
the
war
chapter
iv
militarism
in
germany
and
the
zabern
affair
in
occurred
a
series
of
events
known
as
the
zabern
affair
which
to
my
mind
decided
the
system
the
military
autocracy
for
a
speedy
war
in
this
affair
the
german
people
appeared
at
last
to
be
opening
their
eyes
to
recover
in
some
degree
from
the
panic
fear
of
their
neighbours
which
had
made
them
submit
to
the
arrogance
and
exactions
of
the
military
caste
and
to
be
almost
ready
to
demilitarise
themselves
a
thing
abhorrent
to
the
upholders
of
caste
the
system
the
army
and
the
hohenzollerns
this
writing
on
the
wall
these
letters
forming
the
word
zabern
the
actions
of
the
social
democrats
and
their
growing
boldness
all
were
warnings
to
the
autocracy
of
its
waning
power
and
impelled
that
autocracy
towards
war
as
a
bloodletting
cure
for
popular
discontent
prussia
which
has
imposed
its
will
as
well
as
its
methods
of
thought
and
life
on
all
the
rest
of
germany
is
undoubtedly
a
military
nation
more
than
one
hundred
and
years
ago
mirabeau
the
great
french
orator
at
the
commencement
of
the
revolution
said
war
is
the
national
industry
of
prussia
later
napoleon
remarked
that
prussia
was
hatched
from
a
cannon
ball
and
shortly
before
the
war
of
the
french
military
in
reporting
to
his
government
wrote
that
other
countries
possessed
an
army
but
in
prussia
the
army
possessed
the
country
in
practice
the
class
of
nobles
in
prussia
owns
the
army
officers
may
enter
the
army
in
two
ways
either
by
enlisting
in
the
regiment
first
as
private
and
then
being
rapidly
promoted
to
the
position
of
officer
and
then
probationary
ensign
or
or
the
young
aspirant
may
come
directly
from
a
two
years
course
in
one
of
the
cadet
schools
and
enter
the
regiment
as
probationary
ensign
in
both
cases
the
young
officer
is
observed
by
the
officers
during
a
period
of
probation
and
can
become
an
officer
of
that
regiment
only
by
the
consent
of
the
regimental
officers
in
other
words
each
regiment
is
like
a
club
the
officers
having
the
right
of
this
system
has
practically
confined
the
professional
officers
to
a
class
of
nobles
it
is
not
at
all
unusual
to
find
in
a
regiment
officers
whose
ancestors
were
officers
of
the
same
regiment
two
hundred
years
or
more
ago
in
addition
to
these
officers
who
make
the
army
their
career
a
certain
number
of
germans
after
undergoing
an
enlistment
in
the
army
of
one
year
and
two
periods
of
training
thereafter
are
made
reserve
officers
these
reserve
officers
are
called
to
the
colours
for
manoeuvres
and
also
of
course
when
the
whole
nation
is
arrayed
in
war
these
reserve
officers
seldom
attain
a
rank
higher
than
that
of
captain
they
may
however
while
exercising
civil
functions
be
promoted
and
in
this
manner
the
chancellor
while
occupying
civil
positions
has
gradually
been
promoted
to
the
rank
of
general
and
von
jagow
during
the
war
to
the
rank
of
major
as
a
rule
reserve
officers
are
the
or
who
because
they
have
attained
a
certain
standard
of
education
serve
only
one
year
with
the
army
instead
of
the
two
required
from
others
the
bavarian
army
is
in
a
sense
independent
of
prussia
but
is
modelled
on
the
same
system
for
years
officers
of
the
army
both
in
the
discharge
of
their
duties
and
outside
have
behaved
in
a
very
arrogant
way
toward
the
civil
population
time
and
again
while
i
was
in
germany
waiting
in
line
at
some
ticket
office
an
officer
has
shoved
himself
ahead
of
all
others
without
even
a
protest
from
those
waiting
on
one
occasion
i
went
to
the
races
in
berlin
with
my
and
bought
a
box
while
we
were
out
looking
at
the
horses
between
the
races
a
prussian
officer
and
his
wife
seated
themselves
in
our
box
i
called
the
attention
of
one
of
the
ushers
to
this
but
the
usher
said
that
he
did
not
dare
ask
a
prussian
officer
to
leave
and
it
was
only
after
sending
for
the
head
usher
and
showing
him
my
jockey
club
badge
and
my
pass
as
ambassador
that
i
was
able
to
secure
possession
of
my
own
box
there
have
been
many
instances
in
germany
where
officers
having
a
slight
dispute
with
civilians
have
instantly
cut
the
civilian
down
instances
of
this
kind
and
the
harsh
treatment
of
the
germans
by
officers
and
while
serving
in
the
army
undoubtedly
created
in
germany
a
spirit
of
antagonism
not
only
to
the
army
itself
but
to
the
whole
military
system
of
prussia
affairs
were
brought
to
a
head
by
the
zabern
affair
in
this
affair
the
internal
antagonism
between
the
civil
population
and
professional
soldiers
which
had
assumed
great
proportions
in
a
period
of
long
peace
seemed
to
reach
its
climax
of
course
this
antagonism
had
increased
with
the
increase
in
of
the
effective
strength
of
the
standing
army
bringing
a
material
increase
in
the
numbers
of
officers
and
officers
who
represent
military
professionalism
the
imperial
provinces
or
reichsland
as
alsace
and
lorraine
are
called
had
been
in
a
peculiar
position
within
the
body
politic
of
germany
since
their
annexation
in
the
reichsland
as
indicated
by
its
name
was
to
be
considered
as
common
property
of
the
german
empire
and
was
not
annexed
to
any
one
german
state
its
government
is
by
an
imperial
viceroy
with
a
kind
of
cabinet
consisting
of
one
secretary
of
state
civil
and
under
secretaries
and
department
heads
assisted
by
a
legislative
body
of
two
chambers
one
elected
by
popular
vote
and
the
other
consisting
of
members
partly
elected
by
municipal
bodies
universities
churches
and
so
forth
and
partly
appointed
by
the
imperial
government
the
viceroy
and
his
cabinet
are
appointed
by
the
emperor
in
his
capacity
of
the
sovereign
of
the
reichsland
until
the
of
may
the
reichsland
had
no
constitution
of
its
own
the
form
of
its
government
being
regulated
by
the
reichstag
and
federal
council
bundesrat
in
about
the
same
way
as
the
territories
of
the
united
states
are
ruled
by
congress
and
the
president
in
received
a
constitution
which
gave
it
representation
in
the
federal
council
representation
in
the
reichstag
having
already
been
granted
as
early
as
the
sympathy
of
for
france
had
been
increased
by
the
policy
of
several
of
the
german
viceroys
von
manteuffel
prince
hohenlohe
prince
münster
and
count
wedel
who
had
in
their
administrations
alternated
severe
measures
with
great
leniency
and
had
not
improved
conditions
so
that
the
population
essentially
south
german
was
undoubtedly
irritated
by
the
tone
and
manner
of
the
north
german
officials
great
industries
had
been
developed
by
the
imperial
government
especially
textile
and
coal
mining
and
the
industrial
population
centering
in
mülhausen
was
hotly
and
thoroughly
social
democratic
the
upper
or
classes
were
tied
to
france
by
family
connections
and
by
religion
the
bourgeois
remained
mildly
more
properly
speaking
for
similar
reasons
and
the
working
men
were
opposed
to
the
government
on
social
and
economic
grounds
the
farming
population
not
troubling
much
about
the
politics
but
being
affected
by
the
campaign
of
the
nationalistic
press
were
in
sympathy
with
france
so
the
atmosphere
was
well
prepared
for
the
coming
storm
zabern
or
in
french
saverne
is
a
little
town
of
between
eight
and
nine
thousand
inhabitants
beautifully
situated
at
the
foot
of
the
vosges
mountains
on
the
banks
of
the
canal
its
garrison
comprised
the
staff
and
two
battalions
of
infantry
regiment
number
commanded
by
von
reuter
and
among
its
officers
was
a
lieutenant
von
forstner
a
young
man
only
twenty
years
old
whose
boyish
appearance
had
excited
the
school
children
and
boys
working
in
nearby
iron
factories
to
ridicule
him
it
became
known
that
this
young
officer
while
instructing
his
men
had
insulted
the
french
flag
and
had
called
the
alsatian
recruits
a
meaning
and
frequently
used
by
the
people
of
in
a
jocular
way
but
hotly
resented
by
them
if
used
towards
them
by
others
it
was
further
reported
that
he
had
promised
his
men
a
reward
of
ten
marks
if
one
of
them
in
case
of
trouble
should
bring
down
a
social
democrat
forstner
had
told
his
men
to
beware
and
warned
them
against
listening
to
french
foreign
agents
whom
the
germans
claimed
were
inducing
french
soldiers
to
desert
in
order
to
join
the
french
legion
it
is
probable
that
forstner
in
talking
to
his
men
of
the
french
foreign
legion
used
language
offensive
to
french
ears
he
admitted
that
he
had
used
the
word
in
defiance
of
an
order
of
the
commanding
general
and
for
this
he
had
been
punished
with
several
days
confinement
in
a
military
prison
lieutenant
von
forstner
who
was
ordered
to
instruct
his
squad
about
the
regulations
in
case
of
trouble
with
the
civil
population
claimed
that
he
had
only
added
to
the
usual
instructions
a
statement
that
every
true
soldier
should
do
his
best
to
suppress
any
disturbances
and
that
he
forstner
would
give
a
special
reward
to
any
of
his
men
who
would
arrest
one
of
those
damned
social
democrats
reports
of
the
acts
of
forstner
and
other
officers
were
rapidly
spread
among
the
population
the
two
newspapers
of
zabern
published
articles
the
excitement
grew
and
there
were
demonstrations
against
the
officials
and
especially
against
forstner
finally
conditions
became
so
bad
that
colonel
von
reuter
requested
the
head
of
the
local
civil
administration
director
mahler
to
restore
order
stating
that
he
would
take
the
matter
into
his
own
hands
if
order
was
not
restored
the
director
a
native
of
a
small
village
near
zabern
replied
coolly
that
he
saw
no
necessity
for
interfering
with
peace
loving
and
law
abiding
people
on
november
a
large
crowd
assembled
in
front
of
the
barracks
colonel
von
reuter
ordered
lieutenant
schad
commanding
the
guard
as
officer
of
the
day
to
disperse
the
crowd
accordingly
lieutenant
schad
called
the
guard
to
arms
and
three
times
summoned
the
crowd
to
disperse
and
go
home
the
soldiers
charged
and
drove
the
multitude
across
the
square
and
into
a
side
street
and
arrested
about
fifteen
persons
among
them
the
president
two
judges
and
the
state
attorney
of
the
zabern
supreme
court
who
had
just
come
out
from
the
court
building
and
who
were
caught
in
the
crowd
they
were
subsequently
released
the
rest
of
the
persons
arrested
were
kept
in
the
cellar
of
the
barracks
over
night
the
report
of
these
occurrences
caused
immense
excitement
throughout
germany
a
great
outcry
went
up
against
militarism
even
in
quarters
where
no
socialistic
tendencies
existed
this
feeling
was
not
helped
by
the
fact
that
the
general
commanding
the
fifteenth
army
to
which
the
zabern
regiment
belonged
was
an
exponent
of
extreme
militaristic
ideas
a
man
who
several
years
before
as
colonel
of
the
colonial
troops
representing
the
war
ministry
before
the
reichstag
and
debating
there
the
question
of
the
number
of
troops
to
be
kept
in
german
south
west
africa
had
most
clearly
shown
his
contempt
for
the
reichstag
colonel
von
reuter
and
lieutenant
schad
when
for
their
acts
in
ordering
the
troops
to
move
against
the
civil
population
claimed
the
benefit
of
a
prussian
law
of
which
provided
that
in
any
city
town
or
village
the
highest
military
officer
in
command
must
assume
the
authority
usually
vested
in
the
civil
government
whenever
for
any
reason
the
civil
administration
neglects
to
keep
order
the
colonel
and
lieutenant
were
subsequently
acquitted
on
the
ground
that
they
had
acted
under
the
provisions
of
this
law
the
excitement
throughout
germany
was
further
increased
by
other
circumstances
the
emperor
remained
during
these
critical
days
at
donaueschingen
the
princely
estate
of
his
friend
and
favourite
prince
fürstenberg
enjoying
himself
with
processions
and
cabaret
performances
of
course
all
this
had
been
arranged
long
before
anyone
dreamed
of
any
trouble
in
zabern
and
the
emperor
could
scarcely
be
expected
to
realise
the
gravity
of
the
situation
which
suddenly
arose
but
this
very
fact
created
a
bad
impression
it
was
even
rumoured
that
the
empress
alarmed
by
the
situation
had
ordered
a
train
to
be
made
ready
in
order
to
go
to
him
and
try
to
convince
him
of
the
necessity
of
returning
to
berlin

august
the
newly
appointed
minister
of
war
falkenhayn
went
to
donaueschingen
where
he
was
joined
by
von
deimling
this
action
aggravated
the
situation
because
the
public
concluded
that
the
emperor
would
hear
the
advice
and
report
of
military
officers
only
the
sudden
death
by
heart
failure
of
the
emperor
closest
friend
von
hulsen
chief
of
the
emperor
military
cabinet
during
a
banquet
at
donaueschingen
gave
the
rapidly
developing
events
a
tragic
and
mysterious
colouring
and
these
conferences
in
donaueschingen
resulted
in
the
tendering
of
their
resignations
by
the
viceroy
von
wedel
and
secretary
of
state
zorn
von
bulach
viceroy
and
secretary
of
state
of
who
felt
that
the
military
party
had
gained
an
upper
hand
in
the
conflict
with
the
civil
authorities
the
chancellor
then
hurried
to
donaueschingen
arriving
a
few
hours
before
the
departure
of
the
emperor
and
a
subsequent
order
of
the
emperor
to
general
von
deimling
to
see
to
it
that
the
military
officers
did
not
overstep
their
authority
and
directing
him
to
investigate
the
occurrences
and
take
measures
to
punish
all
guilty
parties
somewhat
quieted
the
nation
and
caused
the
two
highest
civil
officials
of
to
withdraw
their
resignations
zabern
where
a
had
been
sent
by
von
deimling
to
restore
civil
government
had
begun
to
quiet
down
but
the
chancellor
had
hardly
returned
to
berlin
when
another
incident
stirred
germany
while
practising
field
service
in
the
neighbourhood
of
zabern
and
marching
through
a
village
lieutenant
von
forstner
had
an
altercation
with
a
lame
shoemaker
and
cut
him
down
this
brutal
act
of
militarism
caused
a
new
outburst
throughout
germany
forstner
was
tried
by
a
for
hitting
and
wounding
an
unarmed
civilian
and
sentenced
by
the
lower
court
to
one
year
imprisonment
but
acquitted
by
the
higher
court
as
having
acted
in
supposed
no
less
than
three
parties
the
centrum
the
progressives
and
the
social
democrats
addressed
interpellations
to
the
chancellor
about
this
occurrence
at
zabern
i
was
present
at
the
debate
in
the
reichstag
which
took
place
on
the
fourth
fifth
and
sixth
of
december
three
south
germans
a
member
of
the
centrum
hauss
a
progressive
named
roser
and
the
socialist
deputy
from
mülhausen
in
alsace
peirotes
commenced
by
moving
and
seconding
the
interpellation
and
related
in
vehement
language
the
occurrences
at
zabern
the
chancellor
replied
in
defence
of
the
government
unfortunately
he
had
that
morning
received
family
news
of
a
most
unpleasant
character
which
added
to
his
nervousness
he
spoke
with
a
low
voice
and
looked
like
a
downhearted
and
sick
man
it
was
whispered
afterwards
in
the
lobbies
that
he
had
forgotten
the
most
important
part
of
his
speech
the
unfavourable
impression
which
he
made
was
increased
by
von
falkenhayn
appearing
for
the
first
time
before
the
reichstag
if
the
reichstag
members
had
been
disappointed
by
the
chancellor
they
were
stirred
to
the
highest
pitch
of
bitterness
by
the
speech
of
the
war
minister
in
a
sharp
commanding
voice
he
told
them
that
the
military
officers
had
only
done
their
duty
that
they
would
not
be
swerved
from
their
path
by
press
agents
or
hysterical
individuals
that
forstner
was
a
very
young
officer
who
had
been
severely
punished
but
that
this
kind
of
courageous
young
officer
was
the
kind
that
the
country
needed
etc
immediately
after
this
speech
the
progressive
party
moved
that
the
attitude
of
the
chancellor
did
not
meet
the
approval
of
the
representatives
of
the
people
and
it
became
evident
that
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
german
empire
a
vote
of
censure
directed
against
the
government
would
be
debated
the
debate
was
continued
all
the
next
day
the
chancellor
making
another
speech
and
saying
what
he
probably
had
intended
to
say
the
day
before
he
related
what
he
had
achieved
at
donaueschingen
that
the
emperor
had
issued
a
cabinet
order
saying
that
the
military
authorities
should
be
kept
within
legal
bounds
that
all
the
guilty
persons
would
be
punished
that
the
regiment
number
had
been
removed
from
zabern
that
the
absolute
law
of
had
been
abolished
for
and
that
no
chancellor
should
for
one
moment
tolerate
disregard
of
law
by
any
government
officials
civil
or
military
and
remain
in
his
position
this
second
speech
of
the
chancellor
made
a
better
impression
and
somewhat
affected
the
more
extreme
members
of
the
reichstag
but
it
came
too
late
to
prevent
the
passage
of
the
vote
of
censure
by
the
remarkable
majority
of
two
hundred
and
to
only
the
conservatives
voted
against
it
a
few
days
later
when
the
social
democrats
demanded
that
the
chancellor
take
the
consequence
of
the
vote
of
distrust
and
resign
the
attitude
of
the
members
of
all
the
other
parties
who
had
been
favourably
impressed
by
the
second
speech
of
the
chancellor
showed
that
they
were
not
yet
prepared
to
go
the
length
of
holding
that
a
vote
of
distrust
in
the
reichstag
must
necessarily
mean
the
resignation
of
the
chancellor
public
excitement
gradually
calmed
down
and
a
complete
change
of
the
officials
at
zabern
helped
to
bring
about
a
normal
condition
of
affairs
the
viceroy
count
wedel
and
secretary
of
state
zorn
von
bulach
resigned
and
were
replaced
by
von
dallwitz
and
count
rödern
however
the
everlasting
question
came
up
again
a
little
later
during
the
regular
budget
debate
of
the
reichstag
the
chancellor
made
his
speech
giving
a
review
of
the
political
international
situation
he
was
followed
by
herr
scheidemann
leader
of
the
social
democrats
who
mercilessly
attacked
the
chancellor
and
stated
that
if
the
chancellor
still
thought
that
he
was
the
right
man
at
the
helm
he
scheidemann
would
show
that
the
contrary
was
the
case
he
then
enumerated
what
he
called
the
many
political
failures
of
the
chancellor
the
failure
of
the
bill
to
amend
the
prussian
franchise
law
and
stated
that
the
few
bills
which
had
been
passed
such
as
the
bill
giving
a
real
constitution
had
been
carried
only
with
the
help
of
the
social
democratic
party
the
speaker
then
once
more
rehashed
the
incidents
of
the
zabern
matter
referred
to
the
attitude
of
the
emperor
who
he
said
had
evidently
been
too
busy
with
hunting
and
festivities
to
devote
time
to
such
trivial
matters
as
the
zabern
affair
and
also
said
that
if
the
chancellor
had
refused
to
withdraw
the
only
possible
conclusion
from
the
vote
of
the
two
hundred
and
reichstag
members
who
were
certainly
not
influenced
by
personal
feelings
against
the
chancellor
was
that
the
chancellor
must
be
sticking
to
his
post
only
because
of
the
mistaken
idea
of
the
emperor
authority
and
because
he
must
believe
in
the
fetish
of
personal
government
scheidemann
begged
that
the
same
majority
which
had
passed
the
vote
of
censure
should
now
follow
it
up
by
voting
down
the
chancellor
salary
and
thus
force
him
out
of
office
the
chancellor
immediately
replied
saying
that
he
needed
no
advice
from
herr
scheidemann
and
that
when
the
government
had
consented
to
change
the
rules
of
the
reichstag
he
had
expressly
reserved
the
authority
either
to
regard
or
disregard
any
resolution
passed
after
an
interpellation
and
that
formerly
after
discussing
an
interpellation
and
the
answer
of
the
government
no
vote
could
be
taken
to
approve
or
reject
a
resolution
expressing
its
opinion
of
such
course
of
action
such
resolutions
might
be
considered
as
valuable
material
but
it
had
been
agreed
that
they
could
have
no
binding
effect
either
upon
the
government
or
any
member
of
it
and
that
nobody
had
ever
dreamed
that
by
a
mere
change
of
business
rules
the
whole
constitution
of
the
empire
was
being
changed
and
authority
given
to
the
reichstag
to
dismiss
ministers
at
will
that
in
france
and
great
britain
conditions
were
different
but
that
parliamentary
government
did
not
exist
in
germany
that
it
was
the
constitutional
privilege
of
the
emperor
to
appoint
the
chancellor
without
any
assistance
or
advice
from
the
reichstag
that
he
the
chancellor
would
resist
with
all
his
might
every
attempt
to
change
this
system
and
that
he
therefore
refused
to
resign
because
the
resolution
had
no
other
effect
than
to
make
it
evident
that
a
difference
of
opinion
existed
between
the
reichstag
and
the
government
this
debate
took
place
on
december
ninth
and
with
the
exception
of
the
social
democrats
and
the
polish
deputies
the
leaders
of
all
parties
supported
the
view
of
the
chancellor
the
motion
to
strike
out
the
chancellor
salary
was
voted
down
only
the
social
democrats
and
poles
voting
in
favour
of
it
it
is
unquestioned
however
that
this
zabern
affair
and
the
consequent
attitude
of
the
whole
nation
as
well
as
the
extraordinary
vote
in
the
reichstag
greatly
alarmed
the
military
party
it
was
perhaps
the
final
factor
which
decided
the
advocates
of
the
old
military
system
of
germany
in
favour
of
a
european
war
usually
in
past
years
when
the
reichstag
in
adjournments
had
risen
and
cheered
the
name
of
the
emperor
the
social
democrats
absented
themselves
from
the
chamber
but
when
the
reichstag
adjourned
on
may
twentieth
these
members
remained
in
the
chamber
and
refused
either
to
rise
or
to
cheer
the
emperor
the
president
of
the
reichstag
immediately
called
attention
to
this
breach
of
respect
to
the
emperor
upon
which
the
socialists
shouted
that
is
our
affair
and
tried
to
drown
the
cheers
with
hoots
and
hisses
at
which
the
other
parties
applauded
tumultuously
this
occurrence
i
know
greatly
incensed
the
emperor
and
did
much
i
believe
to
win
his
consent
to
the
war
chapter
v
psychology
and
causes
which
prepared
the
nation
for
war
to
the
outsider
the
germans
seem
a
fierce
and
martial
nation
but
in
reality
the
mass
of
the
germans
in
consenting
to
the
great
sacrifice
entailed
by
their
enormous
preparations
for
war
have
been
actuated
by
fear
this
fear
dates
from
the
thirty
years
war
the
war
which
commenced
in
and
was
terminated
in
in
when
the
treaty
of
westphalia
was
concluded
germany
was
almost
a
desert
its
population
had
fallen
from
twenty
millions
to
four
millions
the
few
remaining
people
were
so
starved
that
cannibalism
was
openly
practised
in
the
german
states
polygamy
was
legalised
and
was
a
recognised
institution
for
many
years
thereafter
of
thousand
bohemian
villages
only
six
thousand
were
left
standing
in
the
lower
palatinate
only
of
the
population
survived
in
württemberg
only
hundreds
of
square
miles
of
once
fertile
country
were
overgrown
with
forests
inhabited
only
by
wolves
a
picture
of
this
horrible
period
is
found
in
the
curious
novel
the
adventurous
simplicissimus
written
by
grimmelshausen
and
published
in
which
describes
the
adventures
of
a
wise
peasant
who
finally
leaves
his
native
germany
and
betakes
himself
to
a
desert
island
which
he
refuses
to
leave
when
offered
an
opportunity
to
go
back
to
the
fatherland
he
answers
those
who
wish
to
persuade
him
to
go
back
with
words
which
seem
quite
appropriate
my
god
where
do
you
want
to
carry
me
here
is

there

here
i
know
nothing
of
the

of

nor
have
i
cares
concerning
my
clothing
and

while
i
still
lived
in

everything
was
o
woe
that
i
must
appear
witness
to
such
acts
of
christians
filled
with
war
burning
murder
robbery
plundering
and
the
shame
of
women
and
virgins
the
munich
weekly
simplicissimus
whose
powerful
political
cartoons
have
often
startled
europe
takes
its
name
from
this
character
after
the
conclusion
of
the
thirty
years
war
germany
was
again
and
again
ravaged
by
smaller
wars
culminating
in
the
seven
war
of
frederick
the
great
and
the
humbling
of
germany
under
the
heel
of
napoleon
in
the
wars
of
frederick
the
great
one
tenth
of
the
population
was
killed
even
the
great
battle
of
the
nations
at
leipsic
in
did
not
free
germany
from

and
in

and
the
smaller
north
german
states
with
italy
defeated
austria
assisted
by
bavaria
nassau
saxony
baden
württemberg
and
hanover
i
am
convinced
that
the
fear
of
war
induced
by
a
hereditary
instinct
caused
the
mass
of
the
germans
to
become
the
tools
and
dupes
of
those
who
played
upon
this
very
fear
in
order
to
create
a
military
autocracy
on
the
other
hand
and
especially
in
the
noble
class
we
have
in
germany
a
great
number
of
people
who
believe
in
war
for
its
own
sake
in
part
these
nobles
are
the
descendants
of
the
teutonic
knights
who
conquered
the
slav
population
of
prussia
and
have
ever
since
bound
that
population
to
their
will
the
prussian
army
was
created
by
the
father
of
frederick
the
great
who
went
to
the
most
ridiculous
extremes
in
obtaining
tall
men
at
all
costs
for
his
force
the
father
of
frederick
the
great
gave
the
following
written
instructions
to
the
two
tutors
of
his
son
above
all
let
both
tutors
exert
themselves
to
the
utmost
to
inspire
him
with
a
love
of
soldiery
and
carefully
impress
upon
his
mind
that
as
nothing
can
confer
honour
and
fame
upon
a
prince
except
the
sword
the
monarch
who
seeks
not
his
sole
satisfaction
in
it
must
ever
appear
a
contemptible
character
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
frederick
the
great
left
by
the
death
of
that
father
who
had
once
threatened
to
execute
him
at
the
head
of
a
marvellous
army
with
a
full
treasury
finally
decided
upon
war
as
he
admits
in
his
own
letters
in
order
to
be
talked
about
and
his
desire
to
be
talked
about
led
to
the
seven
years
war
the
short
war
against
denmark
in
against
austria
bavaria
in
and
against
france
in
enormously
increased
both
the
pride
and
prestige
of
the
prussian
army
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
at
all
periods
of
history
it
seems
as
if
some
blind
instinct
had
driven
the
inhabitants
of
the
inhospitable
plains
of
north
germany
to
war
and
to
conquest
the
cimbri
and
teutones
the
tribes
defeated
by
marius
ariovistus
who
was
defeated
by
julius
caesar
the
goths
and
the
the
franks
and
the
saxons
all
have
poured
forth
from
this
infertile
country
for
the
conquest
of
other
lands
the
germans
of
express
this
longing
of
the
north
germans
for
pleasanter
climes
in
the
phrase
in
which
they
demand
a
place
in
the
sun
the
nobles
of
prussia
are
always
for
war
the
business
men
and
manufacturers
and
shipowners
desire
an
increasing
field
for
their
activities
the
german
colonies
were
uninhabitable
by
europeans
all
his
life
the
glittering
emperor
and
his
generals
had
planned
and
thought
of
war
and
the
crown
prince
surrounded
by
his
remarkable
collection
of
relics
and
reminders
of
napoleon
dreamed
only
of
taking
the
lead
in
a
successful
war
of
conquest
early
in
the
winter
of
the
crown
prince
showed
his
collection
of
napoleana
to
a
beautiful
american
woman
of
my
acquaintance
and
said
that
he
hoped
war
would
occur
while
his
father
was
alive
but
if
not
he
would
start
a
war
the
moment
he
came
to
the
throne
since
writing
the
above
the
american
woman
who
had
this
conversation
with
the
crown
prince
wrote
out
for
me
the
exact
conversation
in
her
own
words
as
follows
i
had
given
him
norman
book
great
illusion
which
seeks
to
prove
that
war
is
unprofitable
he
the
crown
prince
said
that
whether
war
was
profitable
or
not
when
he
came
to
the
throne
there
would
be
war
if
not
before
just
for
the
fun
of
it
on
a
previous
occasion
he
had
said
that
the
plan
was
to
attack
and
conquer
france
then
england
and
after
that
my
country
the
united
states
of
america
russia
was
also
to
be
conquered
and
germany
would
be
master
of
the
world
the
extraordinary
collection
of
relics
statues
busts
souvenirs
of
the
first
napoleon
collected
by
the
crown
prince
which
he
was
showing
at
the
time
of
the
first
of
these
conversations
to
this
american
lady
shows
the
trend
of
his
mind
and
that
all
his
admiration
is
centred
upon
napoleon
the
man
who
sought
the
mastery
of
the
world
and
who
is
thought
by
admirers
like
the
crown
prince
to
have
failed
only
because
of
slight
mistakes
which
they
feel
in
his
place
they
would
not
have
made
if
the
germans
long
preparations
for
war
were
to
bear
any
fruit
countless
facts
pointed
to
the
summer
of
as
the
time
when
the
army
should
strike
that
great
and
sudden
blow
at
the
liberties
of
the
world
it
was
in
june
that
the
improved
kiel
canal
was
reopened
enabling
the
greatest
warships
to
pass
from
the
baltic
to
the
north
sea
in
the
zeppelins
the
germans
had
arms
not
possessed
by
any
other
country
and
with
which
they
undoubtedly
believed
that
they
could
do
much
more
damage
to
england
than
was
the
case
after
the
actual
outbreak
of
hostilities
they
had
paid
great
attention
to
the
development
of
the
submarine
their
aeroplanes
were
superior
to
those
of
other
nations
they
believed
that
in
the
use
of
poison
gas
which
was
prepared
before
the
outbreak
of
the
war
they
had
a
prize
that
would
absolutely
demoralise
their
enemy
they
had
their
flame
throwers
and
the
heavy
artillery
and
howitzers
which
reduced
the
redoubtable
forts
of
liege
and
namur
to
fragments
within
a
few
hours
and
which
made
the
holding
of
any
fortresses
impossible
on
their
side
by
the
imposition
of
a
heavy
tax
called
the
or
supplementary
defence
tax
they
had
in
increased
their
army
by
a
number
of
army
corps
on
the
other
hand
the
law
for
three
years
military
service
voted
in
france
had
not
yet
gone
into
effect
nor
had
the
law
for
universal
military
service
voted
by
the
belgian
chambers
undoubtedly
the
germans
based
great
hopes
upon
the
bagdad
railway
which
was
to
carry
their
influence
to
the
east
and
even
threatened
the
rule
of
england
in
egypt
and
india
undoubtedly
there
was
talk
too
of
a
slav
railroad
to
run
from
the
danube
to
the
adriatic
which
would
cut
off
germany
from
access
to
the
southern
sea
francis
deloisi
the
frenchman
in
his
book
published
before
the
great
war
called
de
la
guerre
des
balkans
à
la
guerre
européenne
says
in
a
word
the
present
war
balkan
is
the
work
of
russia
and
the
danube
asiatic
railway
is
a
russian
project
if
it
succeeds
a
continuous
barrier
of
slav
peoples
will
bar
the
way
to
the
mediterranean
of
the
path
of
expansion
from
the
black
sea
to
the
adriatic
but
here
again
the
romanoffs
confront
the
hapsburgs
the
conflict
becomes
the
conflict
two
great
groups
are
formed
and
the
balkan
conflict
becomes
the
european
conflict
another
reason
for
an
immediate
war
was
the
loan
by
france
to
russia
made
on
condition
that
additional
strategic
railways
were
to
be
constructed
by
the
russians
in
poland
although
this
money
had
been
received
the
railways
had
not
been
constructed
at
the
time
of
the
opening
of
the
great
war
speaking
of
this
situation
the
russian
general
kuropatkin
in
his
report
for
the
year
said
we
must
cherish
no
illusions
as
to
the
possibility
of
an
easy
victory
over
the
austrian
army
and
he
then
went
on
to
say
austria
had
eight
railways
to
transport
troops
to
the
russian
frontier
while
russia
had
only
four
and
while
germany
had
seventeen
such
railways
running
to
the
frontier
the
russians
had
only
five
kuropatkin
further
said
the
differences
are
too
enormous
and
leave
our
neighbours
a
superiority
which
can
not
be
overcome
by
the
numbers
of
our
troops
or
their
courage
comparing
the
two
armies
he
said
the
invasion
of
russia
by
german
troops
is
more
probable
than
the
invasion
of
germany
by
russian
troops
and
our
western
frontier
in
the
event
of
a
european
war
would
be
in
such
danger
as
it
never
has
known
in
all
the
history
of
russia
agitation
by
workmen
in
russia
was
believed
in
germany
to
be
the
beginning
of
a
revolution
illuminating
figures
may
be
seen
in
the
gold
purchase
of
the
german
imperial
bank
in
marks
in
marks
but
in
marks
there
was
a
belief
in
germany
that
the
french
nation
was
degenerate
and
corrupt
and
unprepared
for
war
this
belief
became
conviction
when
in
the
debates
of
the
french
senate
senator
humbert
early
in
publicly
exposed
what
he
claimed
to
be
the
weakness
and
unpreparedness
of
france
prince
lichnowsky
the
german
ambassador
in
london
certainly
reported
to
his
government
that
england
did
not
wish
to
enter
the
war
he
claims
now
that
he
did
not
mean
that
england
would
not
fight
at
all
events
but
undoubtedly
the
german
foreign
office
believed
that
england
would
remain
out
of
the
war
the
raising
of
the
ulster
army
by
sir
edward
carson
one
of
the
most
gigantic
political
bluffs
in
all
history
which
had
no
more
revolutionary
or
military
significance
than
a
torchlight
parade
during
one
of
our
presidential
campaigns
was
reported
by
the
german
spies
as
a
real
and
serious
revolutionary
movement
and
of
course
it
was
believed
by
the
germans
that
ireland
would
rise
in
general
rebellion
the
moment
that
war
was
declared
in
the
summer
of
russia
was
believed
to
be
on
the
edge
of
revolution
as
i
have
said
in
a
previous
chapter
the
movement
against
militarism
culminating
in
the
extraordinary
vote
in
the
reichstag
against
the
government
at
the
time
of
the
zabern
affair
warned
the
government
and
military
people
that
the
mass
of
germans
were
coming
to
their
senses
and
were
preparing
to
shake
off
the
bogy
of
militarism
and
fear
which
had
roosted
so
long
on
their
shoulders
like
a
prussian
the
and
the
annexationists
were
hot
for
war
the
people
alive
could
recall
only
three
wars
the
war
against
denmark
in
which
was
settled
in
a
few
days
and
added
the
duchies
of
schleswig
and
holstein
to
the
prussian
crown
and
the
war
of
in
which
bavaria
baden
württemberg
and
saxony
were
defeated
when
the
austrian
kingdom
of
hanover
disappeared
and
the
territories
of
and
nassau
and
the
free
city
of
frankfort
were
added
to
prussia
this
war
from
its
declaration
to
the
battle
of
königgratz
in
which
the
austrians
were
completely
defeated
lasted
only
two
weeks
in
france
was
defeated
within
a
month
and
a
half
after
the
opening
of
hostilities
so
that
the
kaiser
was
implicitly
believed
when
on
the
first
day
of
the
war
he
appeared
on
the
balcony
of
the
palace
and
told
the
crowds
who
were
keen
for
war
that
before
the
leaves
have
fallen
from
the
trees
you
will
be
back
in
your
homes
the
army
and
all
germany
believed
him
and
believed
too
that
a
few
short
weeks
would
see
the
destruction
of
france
and
the
consequent
seizure
of
her
rich
colonies
that
russia
could
then
be
struck
a
good
quick
blow
before
she
could
concentrate
her
army
and
resources
that
england
would
remain
neutral
and
that
germany
would
consequently
become
if
not
the
actual
owner
at
least
the
dictator
of
the
world
some
one
has
since
said
that
the
emperor
must
have
meant
pine
trees
working
ever
in
the
dark
either
owning
or
influencing
newspapers
the
great
munition
and
arms
factory
of
the
krupp
insidiously
poisoned
the
minds
of
the
people
with
the
microbe
of
war
prince
lichnowsky
the
german
ambassador
to
london
called
upon
me
often
after
the
outbreak
of
the
war
and
insisted
that
he
had
correctly
reported
the
sentiments
of
england
in
saying
that
england
did
not
want
war
after
his
return
to
germany
the
germans
quite
unfairly
treated
him
as
a
man
who
had
failed
and
seemed
to
blame
him
because
england
had
taken
the
only
possible
course
open
to
her
and
ranged
herself
on
the
side
of
france
and
russia
the
dedication
at
leipzig
in
the
year
of
the
great
monument
to
celebrate
what
is
called
the
war
of
liberation
and
the
victory
of
leipzig
in
the
war
of
the
nations
had
undoubtedly
kindled
a
martial
spirit
in
germany
to
my
mind
the
course
which
really
determined
the
emperor
and
the
ruling
class
for
war
was
the
attitude
of
the
whole
people
in
the
zabern
affair
and
their
evident
and
growing
dislike
of
militarism
the
fact
that
the
socialists
at
the
close
of
the
session
of
the
reichstag
boldly
remained
in
the
chamber
and
refused
to
rise
or
to
cheer
the
name
of
the
emperor
indicated
a
new
spirit
of
resistance
to
autocracy
and
autocracy
saw
that
if
it
was
to
keep
its
hold
upon
germany
it
must
lead
the
nation
into
a
short
and
successful
war
this
is
no
new
trick
of
a
ruling
and
aristocratic
class
from
the
days
when
the
patricians
of
rome
forced
the
people
into
war
whenever
the
people
showed
a
disposition
to
demand
their
rights
autocracies
have
always
turned
to
war
as
the
best
antidote
against
the
spirit
of
democracy

just
before

of

near

canal
is
the
principal
naval
centre
of
germany
when
the
germans
decided
to
build
up
a
great
fleet
the
emperor
used
every
means
to
encourage
a
love
of
yachting
and
of
the
sea
and
endeavoured
to
make
the
kiel
week
a
rival
of
the
week
at
cowes
the
english
yachting
centre
with
this
end
in
view
the
rich
germans
were
encouraged
and
almost
commanded
to
build
and
race
yachts
and
americans
and
others
who
visited
kiel
in
their
yachts
were
entertained
by
the
emperor
in
an
intimacy
impossible
if
they
had
come
to
berlin
merely
as
tourists

in
a
hotel

arrived
there
on

of

and
that
night
went
with
armour
to
dine
with
the
emperor
on
board
the
yacht
in
the

were
a
fair
number
of
german

mostly

on

and
after
dinner
the
emperor
drew
me
over
to
the
rail
of
the
ship
and
talked
to
me
for
some
time
i
wish
that
diplomatic
etiquette
would
permit
me
to
reveal
what
he
said
but
even
in

time
i
do
not
think
i
ought
to
violate
the
confidence
that
hospitality
seals
however
important
and
interesting
especially
to
the
tame
socialists
of

i
do
not

prince
henry
and
his
wife
who
reside
in
the
castle
at
kiel
were
to
give
an
afternoon
reception
and
garden
party
but
on
arriving
at
the
gates
we
were
told
that
the
party
would
not
take
place
after
going
on
board
the
frederick
wile
the
celebrated
correspondent
of
the
daily
ranged
up
alongside
in
a
small
launch
and
informed
us
that
the
arch
duke
franz
ferdinand
the
heir
to
the
austrian
throne
and
his
wife
had
been
assassinated
at
sarajevo
there
was
much
rushing
to
and
fro
in
fast
launches
the
emperor
himself
being
summoned
from
the
race
which
was
in
progress
that
night
we
dined
on
board
the
yacht
of
the
prince
of
monaco
all
the
diplomats
and
notables
whom
i
met
during
the
afternoon
and
evening
seemed
to
think
that
there
was
no
chance
that
the
tragedy
at
sarajevo
would
lead
to
war
the
next
morning
the
emperor
left
early
for
berlin
but
expressly
directed
that
the
festivities
and
races
at
kiel
should
be
carried
out
as
arranged
monday
afternoon
there
was
a
in
the
large
hall
of
the
yacht
club
at
kiel
the
emperor
was
to
have
presided
at
this
dinner
but
his
place
was
taken
by
his
brother
prince
henry
sir
edward
goschen
the
british
ambassador
who
was
living
on
one
of
the
british
battleships
sat
on
his
right
and
i
sat
on
his
left
during
the
evening
a
curious
incident
happened
the
prince
and
i
were
talking
of
the
dangers
of
speaking
and
what
a
dangerous
sport
it
was
in
the
midst
of
our
conversation
some
one
whispered
to
the
prince
and
he
rose
to
his
feet
proposed
the
health
of
the
visiting
british
admiral
and
fleet
and
made
a
little
speech
as
he
concluded
he
said
addressing
the
officers
of
the
british
fleet
we
are
sorry
you
are
going
and
we
are
sorry
you
came
it
is
remarkable
as
showing
the
discipline
of
the
german
nation
and
their
respect
for
authority
that
thereafter
no
german
ever
referred
to
this
curious
slip
of
the
tongue
the
night
was
rather
mild
and
after
dinner
we
walked
about
the
gardens
of
the
yacht
club
i
had
a
long
and
interesting
conversation
with
the
prince
of

a
large
income
from

seemed
most
exercised
over
the
dislike
of
the
germans
by
all
other
peoples
and
asked
me
why
i
thought
it
existed
i
politely
told
him
that
i
thought
it
existed
because
of
the
success
which
the
germans
had
had
in
all
fields
of
endeavour
particularly
in
manufacturing
and
commerce
he
said
with
great
truth
that
he
believed
a
great
deal
of
it
came
from
the
bad
manners
of
the
travelling
germans
prince
henry
is
an
able
and
reasonable
man
with
a
most
delightful
manner
he
speaks
english
with
a
perfect
english
accent
and
i
think
would
be
far
happier
as
an
english
country
gentleman
than
as
the
grand
admiral
of
the
german
baltic
fleet
he
has
been
devoted
to
automobiling
and
has
greatly
encouraged
that
industry
in
germany
the
automobile
club
of
berlin
is
his
particular
pet
on
returning
to
kiel
next
day
we
spent
several
days
longer
there
i
lunched
on
board
his
battleship
with
grand
admiral
von
tirpitz
sitting
next
to
him
at
the
table
he
struck
me
then
as
an
amiable
sea
dog
combining
much
political
and
worldly
wisdom
with
his
knowledge
of
the
sea
from
kiel
we
motored
one
night
to
dine
with
a
count
and
countess
in
their
country
house
this
house
had
been
built
perhaps
two
hundred
years
and
was
on
one
side
of
a
square
the
other
three
sides
being
formed
by
the
great
stone
barns
in
which
the
produce
of
the
estate
was
stored
although
the
first
floor
of
the
house
was
elevated
about
eight
feet
above
the
ground
the
family
on
account
of
the
dampness
of
that
part
of
the
world
lived
in
the
second
story
and
the
dining
room
was
on
this
story
an
ancestor
of
the
count
had
at
a
time
when
this
part
of
the
country
was
part
of
denmark
and
about
the
year
lent
all
his
available
money
to
the
king
of
denmark
a
crude
painting
in
the
hall
showed
him
sitting
in
the
hall
of
this
particular
house
smoking
a
long
pipe
and
surrounded
by
three
or
four
sisters
who
were
all
spinning
our
hostess
told
us
that
this
picture
represented
the
lending
ancestor
being
supported
by
his
sisters
while
waiting
the
return
of
the
loan
which
he
had
made
to
the
danish
king
an
early
example
of
the
situation
disclosed
by
the
popular
song
which
runs
everybody
works
but
father
of
course
no
one
ever
expected
a
prussian
nobleman
to
do
any
work
except
in
the
line
of
war
or
in
governing
the
inferior
classes
of
the
country
chapter
vii
the
system
people
of
other
countries
have
been
wondering
why
it
is
that
the
german
government
is
able
so
easily
to
impose
its
will
upon
the
german
people
i
have
set
out
in
another
chapter
in
detail
the
political
system
from
which
you
have
seen
that
the
reichstag
is
nothing
but
a
debating
society
that
the
prussians
do
not
really
have
universal
suffrage
but
by
reason
of
the
vicious
circle
system
of
voting
the
elective
franchise
remains
in
the
hands
of
the
few
and
that
the
government
of
the
country
through
the
and
is
a
central
system
from
above
downwards
and
not
the
election
of
the
rulers
by
the
people
and
in
the
chapter
on
militarism
and
zabern
i
have
told
by
what
means
the
control
of
the
army
is
kept
in
the
hands
of
the
class
of
nobles
these
are
not
the
only
means
by
which
the
system
controls
the
country
these
alone
would
not
suffice
from
the
time
when
he
is
four
years
old
the
german
is
disciplined
and
taught
that
his
government
is
the
only
good
and
effective
form
the
teachers
in
the
schools
are
all
government
paid
and
teach
the
children
only
the
principles
desired
by
the
rulers
of
the
german
people
there
are
no
saturday
holidays
in
the
german
schools
and
their
summer
holidays
are
for
only
three
to
five
weeks
you
never
see
gangs
of
small
boys
in
germany
their
games
and
their
walks
are
superintended
by
their
teachers
who
are
always
inculcating
in
them
reverence
and
awe
for
the
military
heroes
of
the
past
and
present
on
saturday
night
the
german
boy
is
turned
over
by
the
state
paid
school
teacher
to
the
state
paid
pastor
who
adds
divine
authority
to
the
principles
of
reverence
for
the
german
system
there
is
a
real
system
of
caste
in
germany
for
instance
i
was
playing
tennis
one
day
with
a
man
and
while
dressing
afterwards
i
asked
him
what
he
was
he
answered
that
he
was
a
or
merchant
for
the
german
this
answer
was
enough
it
placed
him
in
the
merchant
class
i
asked
him
what
sort
of
a
he
was
he
then
told
me
he
was
president
of
a
large
electrical
company
of
course
with
us
he
would
have
answered
first
that
he
was
president
of
the
electrical
company
but
being
a
german
he
simply
disclosed
his
caste
without
going
into
details
it
is
a
curious
thing
on
the
registers
of
guests
in
a
german
summer
resort
to
see
schultze
registered
with
landrat
schwartz
and
second
lieutenant
von
bing
of
course
there
is
no
doubt
as
to
the
relative
social
positions
of
schultze
and
second
lieutenant
von
bing
schultze
may
have
a
steam
yacht
and
a
tiara
an
opera
box
and
ten
million
marks
she
may
be
an
old
lady
noted
for
her
works
of
charity
her
husband
may
have
made
discoveries
of
enormous
value
to
the
human
race
but
she
will
always
be
compelled
to
take
her
place
behind
second
lieutenant
von
bing
even
if
the
latter
is
only
seventeen
years
old
of
course
occasionally
officers
of
the
army
and
navy
condescend
to
marry
into
the
merchant
caste
and
if
a
girl
has
a
choice
of
three
equally
attractive
young
men
one
a
doctor
earning
ten
thousand
dollars
a
year
one
a
manufacturer
earning
the
same
amount
and
one
an
army
officer
with
a
von
before
his
name
and
three
thousand
dollars
a
year
there
is
no
hesitation
on
her
part
she
takes
the
noble
and
the
army
officer
for
years
all
the
highest
official
positions
of
the
government
have
been
held
by
members
of
the
prussian
noble
class
and
when
zimmermann
of
a
substantial
family
in
east
prussia
but
not
of
noble
birth
was
made
foreign
minister
the
most
intense
surprise
was
exhibited
all
over
germany
at
this
innovation
one
of
the
most
successful
ways
of
disciplining
the
people
is
by
the
system
means
councillor
and
is
a
title
of
honour
given
to
any
one
who
has
attained
a
certain
measure
of
success
or
standing
in
his
chosen
business
or
profession
for
instance
a
business
man
is
made
a
commerce
a
lawyer
a
justice
a
doctor
a
sanitary
an
architect
or
builder
a
building
a
keeper
of
the
archives
an
archive
and
so
on
they
are
created
in
this
way
first
a
man
becomes
a
plain
then
later
on
he
becomes
a
secret
or
privy
councillor
still
later
a
court
secret
and
later
still
a
or
really
and
truly
secret
court
to
which
may
be
added
the
title
of
excellency
which
puts
the
man
who
has
attained
this
absolutely
at
the
head
of
the
ladder
but
see
the
insidious
working
of
the
system
by
german
custom
the
woman
always
carries
the
husband
title
the
wife
of
a
successful
builder
is
known
as
really
truly
secret
court
building
and
her
social
precedence
over
the
other
women
depends
entirely
upon
her
husband
position
in
the
class
titles
of
nobility
alone
do
not
count
when
they
come
in
contact
with
a
high
government
position
now
if
a
lawyer
gets
to
be
about
forty
years
old
and
is
not
some
sort
of
a
his
wife
begins
to
nag
him
and
his
friends
and
relations
look
at
him
with
suspicion
there
must
be
something
in
his
life
which
prevents
his
obtaining
the
coveted
distinction
and
if
there
is
anything
in
a
man
past
if
he
has
shown
at
any
time
any
spirit
of
opposition
to
the
government
as
disclosed
by
the
police
registers
which
are
kept
written
up
to
date
about
every
german
citizen
then
he
has
no
chance
of
obtaining
any
of
these
distinctions
which
make
up
so
much
of
the
social
life
of
germany
it
is
a
means
by
which
the
government
keeps
a
far
tighter
hold
on
the
intellectual
part
of
its
population
than
if
they
were
threatened
with
torture
and
the
stake
the
social
democrats
who
of
course
have
declared
themselves
against
the
existing
system
of
government
and
in
favour
of
a
republic
can
receive
no
distinctions
from
the
government
because
they
dared
to
lift
their
voices
and
their
pens
in
criticism
of
the
existing
order
for
them
there
is
the
fear
of
the
law
convictions
for
the
crime
of
are
of
almost
daily
occurrence
and
at
the
opening
of
the
war
an
amnesty
was
granted
in
many
of
these
cases
the
ministry
of
war
withdrawing
many
prosecutions
against
poor
devils
waiting
their
trial
in
jail
because
they
had
dared
to
speak
disrespectfully
of
the
army
the
following
quotation
from
a
german
book
written
since
the
war
shows
very
clearly
that
this
state
of
affairs
existed
in
the
beneficent
atmosphere
of
general
amnesty
came
the
news
that
the
minister
of
war
had
withdrawn
pending
prosecutions
against
newspapers
on
account
of
their
insults
to
the
army
or
its
members
jastrow
im
kriegszustand
besides
the
system
and
the
military
system
there
exists
the
enormous
mass
of
prussian
officials
in
a
country
where
so
many
things
are
under
government
control
these
officials
are
almost
immeasurably
more
numerous
than
in
other
countries
in
prussia
for
example
all
the
railways
are
with
the
exception
of
one
road
about
sixty
miles
long
and
a
few
small
branch
roads
this
army
of
officials
are
retainers
of
the
government
and
not
only
of
course
themselves
refrain
from
criticising
the
system
but
also
use
their
influence
upon
the
members
of
their
own
family
and
all
with
whom
they
come
in
contact
they
are
subject
to
trial
in
special
secret
courts
and
one
of
them
who
dared
in
any
way
to
criticise
the
existing
system
would
not
for
long
remain
a
member
of
it
of
course
the
members
of
the
reichstag
have
the
privilege
of
free
speech
without
responsibility
and
there
are
occasional
socialists
who
know
that
they
have
nothing
to
expect
from
the
government
who
dare
to
speak
in
criticism
all
the
newspapers
are
subject
to
control
as
in
no
other
country
in
the
first
place
their
proprietors
are
subject
to
the
influence
of
the
system
as
is
every
other
german
and
the
newspaper
proprietor
whose
sons
perhaps
enter
the
army
whose
daughters
may
be
married
to
naval
officers
or
officials
and
who
seeks
for
his
sons
promotion
as
judge
state
attorney
has
to
be
very
careful
that
the
utterances
of
his
newspaper
do
not
prevent
his
promotion
in
the
social
scale
or
interfere
with
the
career
of
his
family
and
relations
since
the
war
while
a
preventive
censure
does
not
exist
in
germany
nevertheless
a
newspaper
may
be
suppressed
at
will
a
fearful
punishment
for
a
newspaper
which
by
being
suppressed
for
say
five
days
or
a
week
has
its
business
affairs
thrown
into
the
utmost
confusion
and
suffers
an
enormous
direct
loss
many
of
the
larger
newspapers
are
either
owned
or
influenced
by
concerns
like
the
krupps
for
instance
during
this
war
all
news
coming
from
germany
to
other
countries
has
been
furnished
by
either
the
or
service
both
news
agencies
in
which
the
krupps
are
large
stockholders
the
smaller
newspapers
are
influenced
directly
by
the
government
in
the
middle
ages
there
was
often
declared
a
sort
of
truce
to
prevent
fighting
in
a
city
which
was
called
the
or
peace
of
the
city
and
at
the
beginning
of
this
war
all
political
parties
were
supposed
to
declare
a
sort
of
and
not
try
to
obtain
any
political
advantage
there
was
therefore
intense
indignation
among
the
social
democrats
of
germany
when
it
was
discovered
in
the
spring
of
that
the
minister
of
the
interior
was
making
arrangements
to
send
out
news
service
to
be
furnished
free
to
the
smaller
newspapers
and
that
he
was
engaged
in
instructing
the
various
and
other
officials
of
the
interior
department
how
effectively
to
use
this
machinery
in
order
to
gull
the
people
to
the
advantage
of
the
government
and
to
keep
them
in
ignorance
of
anything
which
might
tend
to
turn
them
against
the
system
besides
the
system
there
is
of
course
the
system
of
decorations
countless
orders
and
decorations
are
given
in
germany
at
the
head
is
the
order
of
the
black
eagle
there
are
the
order
of
the
red
eagle
the
prussian
order
of
the
crown
the
orders
le
the
order
of
the
house
of
hohenzollern
and
many
others
and
in
each
of
the
states
there
are
also
orders
distinctions
and
decorations
these
orders
in
turn
are
divided
into
numerous
classes
for
instance
a
man
can
have
the
red
eagle
order
of
the
first
second
third
or
fourth
class
and
these
may
be
complicated
with
a
laurel
crown
with
an
oak
crown
with
swords
and
with
stars
etc
even
domestic
servants
who
have
served
a
long
time
in
one
family
receive
orders
and
faithful
postmen
and
other
officials
who
have
never
appeared
on
the
police
books
for
having
made
statements
against
the
government
or
the
army
are
sure
of
receiving
some
sort
of
order
once
a
year
in
berlin
a
great
festival
is
held
called
the
when
all
who
hold
orders
or
decorations
of
any
kind
are
invited
to
a
great
banquet
the
butler
who
has
served
for
years
there
rubs
shoulders
with
the
diplomat
who
has
received
a
black
eagle
for
adding
a
colony
to
the
german
empire
and
the
faithful
cook
may
be
seated
near
an
officer
who
has
obtained
le
for
sinking
an
enemy
warship
all
this
in
one
sense
is
democratic
but
in
its
effect
it
tends
to
induce
the
plain
people
to
be
satisfied
with
a
piece
of
ribbon
instead
of
the
right
to
vote
and
to
make
them
upholders
of
a
system
by
which
they
are
deprived
of
any
opportunity
to
make
a
real
advance
in
life
this
system
is
the
most
complete
that
has
ever
existed
in
any
country
because
it
has
drawn
so
many
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
into
its
meshes
practically
the
industrial
workers
of
the
great
towns
and
the
stupid
peasants
in
the
country
are
the
only
people
in
germany

his
children
to
inherit
these
estates
there
are
only
thirteen
girls
in
the
world
whom
he
can
marry
according
to
the
terms
of
the
instrument
by
which
some
distant
ancestor
founded
this
inheritance
this
vicious
system
has
prevented
extensive
peasant
proprietorship
the
government
however
to
a
certain
extent
has
encouraged
peasant
proprietorship
but
only
with
very
small
parcels
of
land
and
it
would
be
an
unusual
thing
in
germany
especially
in
prussia
to
find
a
peasant
owning
more
than
twenty
or
thirty
acres
of
land
most
of
the
land
being
held
by
the
peasants
in
such
small
quantities
that
after
working
their
own
lands
they
have
time
left
to
work
the
lands
of
the
adjoining
landed
proprietor
at
a
very
small
wage
all
the
titles
of
the
nobility
are
not
confined
to
the
oldest
son
the
pocketbook
of
counts
published
by
the
same
firm
which
publishes
the
almanac
de
gotha
contains
the
counts
of
austria
germany
and
hungary
together
showing
in
this
way
the
intimate
personal
relation
between
the
noble
families
of
these
three
countries
all
the
sons
of
a
count
are
counts
and
so
on
ad
infinitum
thus
in
hungary
there
are
probably
seventy
counts
szecheny
and
about
the
same
number
of
zichy
etc
some
of
the
german
noble
families
are
not
far
behind
in
fact
it
may
be
said
that
almost
any
person
in
what
is
known
as
society
in
the
central
empires
has
a
title
of
some
sort
the
prefix
von
shows
that
the
person
is
a
noble
and
is
often
coupled
with
names
of
people
who
have
no
title
by
custom
in
germany
a
von
when
he
goes
abroad
is
allowed
to
call
himself
baron
but
in
germany
he
could
not
do
so
these
noble
families
in
the
central
empires
by
the
system
of
which
i
have
described
hold
large
landed
estates
and
naturally
exert
a
great
influence
upon
their
labourers
as
a
rule
the
system
of
tenant
farming
does
not
exist
that
is
estates
are
not
leased
to
small
farmers
as
was
the
custom
in
ireland
and
is
still
in
great
britain
but
estates
are
worked
as
great
agricultural
enterprises
under
superintendents
appointed
by
the
proprietor
this
system
impossible
in
america
or
even
in
great
britain
is
possible
in
the
central
empires
where
the
villages
are
full
of
peasants
who
not
so
many
generations
ago
were
serfs
attached
to
the
land
and
who
lived
in
wholesome
fear
of
the
landed
proprietors
this
is
the
first
method
by
which
influence
is
exercised
on
the
population
there
is
also
the
restricted
franchise
or
circle
voting
which
gives
the
control
of
the
franchise
to
a
few
rich
proprietors
as
a
rule
the
oldest
son
enters
the
army
as
an
officer
and
may
continue
but
if
he
has
not
displayed
any
special
aptitude
for
the
military
profession
he
retires
and
manages
his
estate
these
estates
are
calculated
by
their
proprietors
to
give
at
least
four
per
cent
interest
income
on
the
value
of
the
land
many
younger
sons
after
a
short
term
of
service
in
the
army
usually
as
officers
and
not
as
leave
the
army
and
enter
diplomacy
or
some
other
branch
of
the
government
service
the
offices
of
judge
district
attorney
not
being
elective
this
career
as
well
as
that
leading
to
the
position
of
and
of
a
province
is
open
to
those
who
because
they
belong
to
old
prussian
landed
families
find
favour
in
the
eyes
of
the
government
much
is
heard
in
germany
and
out
of
germany
of
the
prussian
squire
or
junker
there
is
no
leisure
class
among
the
junkers
they
are
all
workers
patriotic
honest
and
devoted
to
the
emperor
and
the
fatherland
if
it
is
possible
that
government
by
one
class
is
to
be
suffered
then
the
prussian
junkers
have
proved
themselves
more
fit
for
rule
than
any
class
in
all
history
their
virtues
are
spartan
their
minds
narrow
but
incorruptible
and
their
bravery
and
patriotism
undoubted
one
can
but
admire
them
and
their
stern
virtues
this
class
largely
because
of
its
poverty
and
its
constant
occupation
does
not
travel
nor
does
the
casual
tourist
or
health
seeker
in
germany
come
in
contact
with
these
men
the
junkers
will
fight
hard
to
keep
their
privileges
and
the
throne
will
fight
hard
for
the
junkers
because
they
are
the
greatest
supporters
of
the
hohenzollerns
the
workingmen
in
the
cities
are
hard
workers
and
probably
work
longer
and
get
less
out
of
life
than
any
workingmen
in
the
world
the
laws
so
much
admired
and
made
ostensibly
for
their
protection
such
as
insurance
against
unemployment
sickness
injury
old
age
are
in
reality
skilful
measures
which
bind
them
to
the
soil
as
effectively
as
the
serfs
of
the
middle
ages
were
bound
to
their
masters
estates
i
have
had
letters
from
workingmen
who
have
worked
in
america
begging
me
for
a
steerage
fare
to
america
saying
that
their
insurance
payments
were
so
large
that
they
could
not
save
money
out
of
their
wages
of
course
after
having
made
these
payments
for
some
years
the
workingman
naturally
hesitates
to
emigrate
and
so
lose
all
the
premiums
he
has
paid
to
the
state
in
peace
times
a
skilled
mechanic
in
germany
received
less
than
two
dollars
a
day
for
which
he
was
compelled
to
work
at
least
ten
hours
agricultural
labourers
in
the
central
empires
are
poorly
paid
the
women
do
much
of
the
work
done
here
by
men
for
instance
once
when
staying
at
a
nobleman
estate
in
hungary
i
noticed
that
the
gardeners
were
all
women
and
on
inquiring
how
much
they
received
i
was
told
they
were
paid
about
twenty
cents
a
day
the
women
in
the
farming
districts
of
germany
are
worked
harder
than
the
cattle
in
summer
time
they
are
out
in
the
fields
at
five
or
six
in
the
morning
and
do
not
return
until
eight
or
later
at
night
for
this
work
they
are
sometimes
paid
as
high
as
cents
a
day
in
harvest
time
nevertheless
these
small
wages
tempt
many
russians
to
germany
during
the
harvest
season
at
the
outbreak
of
the
war
there
were
perhaps
fifty
thousand
russians
employed
in
germany
men
women
and
girls
these
the
germans
retained
in
a
sort
of
slavery
to
work
the
fields
i
spoke
to
one
polish
girl
who
was
working
on
an
estate
over
which
i
had
shooting
rights
near
berlin
she
told
me
that
at
the
commencement
of
the
war
she
and
her
family
were
working
in
germany
and
that
since
the
war
they
all
desired
to
return
to
poland
but
that
the
germans
would
not
permit
it
this
hard
working
of
women
in
agricultural
pursuits
tends
to
stupefy
and
brutalise
the
rural
population
and
keeps
them
in
a
condition
of
subjection
to
the
prussian
church
and
the
prussian
system
and
in
readiness
for
war
both
prussian
junkers
and
the
german
manufacturers
look
with
favour
upon
the
employment
of
so
many
women
in
farm
work
because
the
greater
the
number
of
the
labourers
the
smaller
their
wages
throughout
the
country
when
i
first
came
to
germany
i
of
course
was
filled
with
the
ideas
that
prevailed
in
america
that
the
german
workingman
had
an
easy
time
my
mind
was
filled
with
pictures
of
the
german
workingmen
sitting
with
their
families
at
tables
drinking
beer
and
listening
to
classical
music
after
i
had
spent
some
time
in
germany
i
found
that
the
reason
that
the
german
workingmen
sat
about
the
tables
was
because
they
were
too
tired
to
do
anything
else
i
sincerely
hope
that
after
the
war
the
workingmen
of
this
country
will
induce
delegates
of
their
german
brothers
to
make
a
tour
of
america
for
when
the
german
workingmen
see
how
much
better
off
the
americans
are
they
will
return
to
germany
and
demand
shorter
hours
and
higher
wages
and
the
american
will
not
be
brought
into
competition
with
labour
slaves
such
as
the
german
workingmen
of
the
period
before
the
war
as
one
goes
through
the
streets
of
berlin
there
are
no
evidences
of
poverty
to
be
seen
but
over
per
cent
of
the
families
in
berlin
are
families
living
in
one
room
the
germans
are
taken
care
of
and
educated
very
much
in
the
same
way
that
the
authorities
here
look
after
the
inmates
of
a
or
penitentiary
such
a
thing
as
a
german
railway
conductor
rising
to
be
president
of
the
road
is
an
impossibility
in
germany
and
the
list
of
men
is
small
indeed
by
that
i
mean
men
who
have
risen
from
the
ranks
of
the
the
socialists
representing
the
element
opposed
to
the
conservatives
elect
a
few
members
to
the
prussian
lower
house
and
about
of
the
members
to
the
reichstag
but
otherwise
have
no
part
whatever
in
the
government
no
socialist
would
have
any
chance
whatever
if
he
set
out
to
enter
the
government
service
with
the
ambition
of
becoming
a
district
attorney
or
judge
jews
have
not
much
chance
in
the
government
service
a
few
exceptions
have
been
made
at
one
time
dernburg
who
carried
on
the
propaganda
in
america
during
the
first
year
of
the
war
and
who
is
a
jew
was
appointed
colonial
minister
of
the
empire
in
my
opinion
the
liberalisation
of
prussia
has
been
halted
by
the
fact
that
there
has
been
no
party
of
protest
except
that
of
the
socialists
and
the
socialists
because
they
have
in
effect
demanded
abolition
of
the
monarchy
and
the
establishment
of
a
republic
as
part
of
their
programme
have
been
unable
to
do
anything
in
the
obtaining
of
the
reforms
up
to
the
beginning
of
the
war
there
was
great
dissatisfaction
the
people
were
irritated
by
certain
direct
taxes
such
as
the
tax
upon
matches
and
because
every
protestant
in
prussia
was
compelled
to
pay
a
tax
for
the
support
of
the
church
unless
he
made
a
declaration
that
he
was
an
atheist
the
only
class
in
germany
which
knows
something
of
the
outside
world
is
the
class
prussian
nobles
of
the
ruling
class
are
not
travellers
they
are
always
busy
with
the
army
and
navy
government
employments
or
their
estates
and
as
a
rule
too
poor
to
travel
the
poor
of
course
do
not
travel
and
the
although
he
learns
much
in
his
travels
in
other
countries
to
make
him
dissatisfied
with
the
small
opportunity
which
he
has
in
a
political
way
in
germany
is
satisfied
to
let
things
stand
because
of
the
enormous
profits
which
he
makes
through
the
low
wages
and
long
hours
of
the
german
workingman
lawyers
and
judges
amount
to
little
in
germany
and
we
do
not
find
there
a
class
of
political
lawyers
who
in
republics
always
seem
to
get
the
management
of
affairs
in
their
own
hands
chapter
viii
the
days
before
the
war
after
my
return
from
kiel
to
berlin
a
period
of
calm
ensued
no
one
seemed
to
think
that
the
murders
at
sarajevo
would
have
any
effect
upon
the
world
the
emperor
had
gone
north
on
his
yacht
but
as
i
believe
not
until
a
certain
line
of
action
had
been
agreed
upon
most
of
the
diplomats
started
on
their
vacations
sir
edward
goschen
british
ambassador
as
well
as
the
russian
ambassador
left
berlin
this
shows
of
course
how
little
war
was
expected
in
diplomatic
circles
i
went
on
two
visits
to
german
in
silesia
where
the
richest
estates
are
situated
one
of
these
visits
was
to
the
of
a
count
one
of
the
wealthiest
men
in
germany
possessed
of
a
fortune
of
about
twenty
to
thirty
million
dollars
he
has
a
great
estate
in
silesia
farmed
as
i
explained
not
by
tenant
farmers
but
by
his
own
superintendents
in
the
centre
is
a
beautiful
country
house
or
castle
we
were
guests
in
the
this
count
and
his
charming
wife
had
travelled
much
and
evidently
desired
to
model
their
country
life
on
that
of
england
our
amusements
were
tennis
swimming
and
shooting
with
dancing
and
music
at
night
life
such
as
this
and
especially
the
lavish
entertainment
of
so
many
guests
is
something
very
exceptional
in
prussian
country
life
and
quite
a
seven
months
wonder
for
the
country
side
some
days
after
my
return
to
berlin
the
ultimatum
of
austria
was
sent
to
serbia
even
then
there
was
very
little
excitement
and
when
the
serbian
answer
was
published
it
was
believed
that
this
would
end
the
incident
and
that
matters
would
be
adjusted
by
dilatory
diplomats
in
the
usual
way
on
the
of
july
matters
began
to
boil
the
emperor
returned
on
this
day
and
from
the
morning
of
the
took
charge
on
the
also
sir
edward
goschen
returned
to
berlin
i
kept
in
touch
so
far
as
possible
with
the
other
diplomats
as
the
german
officials
were
exceedingly
uncommunicative
although
i
called
on
von
jagow
every
day
and
tried
to
get
something
out
of
him
on
the
night
of
the
the
chancellor
and
sir
edward
had
their
memorable
conversation
in
which
the
chancellor
while
making
no
promises
about
the
french
colonies
agreed
if
great
britain
remained
neutral
to
make
no
territorial
aggressions
at
the
expense
of
france
the
chancellor
further
stated
to
sir
edward
that
ever
since
he
had
been
chancellor
the
object
of
his
policy
had
been
to
bring
about
an
understanding
with
england
and
that
he
had
in
mind
a
general
neutrality
agreement
between
germany
and
england
on
the
thirtieth
sir
edward
grey
refused
the
bargain
proposed
namely
that
great
britain
should
engage
to
stand
by
while
the
french
colonies
were
taken
and
france
beaten
so
long
as
french
territory
was
not
taken
sir
edward
grey
said
that
the
bargain
at
the
expense
of
france
would
constitute
a
disgrace
from
which
the
good
name
of
great
britain
would
never
recover
he
also
refused
to
bargain
with
reference
to
the
neutrality
of
belgium
peace
talk
continued
however
on
both
the
thirtieth
and
and
many
diplomats
were
still
optimistic
on
the
i
was
lunching
at
the
hotel
bristol
with
gerard
and
thomas
birch
our
minister
to
portugal
and
his
wife
i
left
the
table
and
went
over
and
talked
to
mouktar
pascha
the
turkish
ambassador
who
assured
me
that
there
was
no
danger
whatever
of
war
but
in
spite
of
his
assurances
and
judging
by
the
situation
and
what
i
learned
from
other
diplomats
i
had
cabled
to
the
state
department
on
the
morning
of
that
day
saying
that
a
general
european
war
was
inevitable
on
the
or
condition
of
danger
of
war
was
proclaimed
at
seven
and
at
seven
the
demand
was
made
by
germany
that
russia
should
demobilise
within
twelve
hours
on
the
thirtieth
i
had
a
talk
with
baron
beyens
the
minister
of
belgium
and
jules
cambon
the
french
ambassador
in
the
garden
of
the
french
embassy
in
the
afternoon
they
both
agreed
that
nothing
could
prevent
war
except
the
intervention
of
america
both
ambassador
cambon
and
minister
beyens
were
very
sad
and
depressed
after
leaving
them
i
met
sir
edward
grey
upon
the
street
and
had
a
short
conversation
with
him
he
also
was
very
depressed
acting
on
my
own
responsibility
i
sent
the
following
letter
to
the
chancellor
your
excellency
is
there
nothing
that
my
country
can
do
nothing
that
i
can
do
towards
stopping
this
dreadful
war
i
am
sure
that
the
president
would
approve
any
act
of
mine
looking
towards
peace
yours
ever
signed
james
w
gerard
to
this
letter
i
never
had
any
reply
on
the
first
of
august
at
five
the
order
for
mobilisation
was
given
and
at
war
was
declared
by
germany
on
russia
the
kaiser
proclaiming
from
the
balcony
of
the
palace
that
he
knew
no
parties
more
of
course
during
these
days
the
population
of
berlin
was
greatly
excited
every
night
great
crowds
of
people
paraded
the
streets
singing
deutschland
ueber
alles
and
demanding
war
extras
distributed
free
were
issued
at
frequent
intervals
by
the
newspapers
and
there
was
a
general
feeling
among
the
germans
that
their
years
of
preparation
would
now
bear
fruit
that
germany
would
conquer
the
world
and
impose
its
upon
all
nations
on
the
second
of
august
i
called
in
the
morning
to
say
to
the
russian
ambassador
his
embassy
was
filled
with
unfortunate
russians
who
had
gone
there
to
seek
protection
and
help
right
and
left
men
and
women
were
weeping
and
the
whole
atmosphere
seemed
that
of
despair
on
the
day
the
russian
ambassador
left
i
sent
him
my
automobile
to
take
him
to
the
station
the
chauffeur
and
footman
reported
to
me
that
the
police
protection
was
inadequate
that
the
automobile
was
nearly
overturned
by
the
crowd
and
that
men
jumped
on
the
running
board
and
struck
the
ambassador
and
the
ladies
with
him
in
the
face
with
sticks
his
train
was
due
to
leave
at
at
about
ten
minutes
of
one
while
i
was
standing
in
my
room
in
the
embassy
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
americans
james
wife
of
the
senator
from
kentucky
and
post
wheeler
wife
of
our
secretary
to
the
embassy
in
japan
came
to
me
and
said
that
they
were
anxious
to
get
through
to
japan
via
siberia
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
i
immediately
scribbled
a
note
to
the
russian
ambassador
asking
him
to
take
them
on
the
train
with
him
this
and
the
ladies
i
confided
to
the
care
of
a
page
boy
of
the
embassy
who
spoke
german
by
some
miracle
he
managed
to
get
them
to
the
railroad
station
before
the
train
left
the
ambassador
kindly
agreeing
to
take
them
with
him
his
train
however
instead
of
going
to
russia
was
headed
for
denmark
and
from
there
the
two
ladies
crossed
to
sweden
thence
to
england
and
so
home
it
being
perhaps
as
well
for
them
that
they
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
attempt
the
siberian
journey
during
this
period
of
mobilisation
the
russian
ambassador
reciprocated
by
confiding
to
me
a
russian
princess
who
had
intended
to
go
out
with
him
but
who
intimidated
perhaps
by
the
scenes
on
the
way
to
the
station
had
lost
her
nerve
at
the
railway
station
and
refused
to
depart
with
the
ambassador
she
remained
for
a
while
in
berlin
and
after
some
weeks
recovered
sufficient
courage
to
make
the
trip
to
denmark
on
the
morning
of
august
fourth
having
received
an
invitation
the
day
before
i
attended
at
the
palace
in
berlin
in
the
room
where
the
court
balls
had
been
held
in
peace
times
a
certain
number
of
the
members
of
the
reichstag
were
assembled
the
diplomats
were
in
a
gallery
on
the
west
side
of
the
room
soon
the
emperor
dressed
in
field
grey
uniform
and
attended
by
several
members
of
his
staff
and
a
number
of
ladies
entered
the
room
he
walked
with
a
martial
stride
and
glanced
toward
the
gallery
where
the
diplomats
were
assembled
as
if
to
see
how
many
were
there
taking
his
place
upon
the
throne
and
standing
he
read
an
address
to
the
members
of
the
reichstag
the
members
cheered
him
and
then
adjourned
to
the
reichstag
where
the
chancellor
addressed
them
making
his
famous
declaration
about
belgium
stating
that
necessity
knew
no
law
and
that
the
german
troops
were
perhaps
at
that
moment
crossing
the
belgian
frontier
certain
laws
which
had
been
prepared
with
reference
to
the
government
of
the
country
and
which
i
will
give
in
more
detail
in
another
place
as
well
as
the
war
credit
were
voted
upon
by
the
reichstag
the
socialists
had
not
been
present
in
the
palace
but
joined
now
in
voting
the
necessary
credits
on
the
afternoon
of
august
fourth
i
went
to
see
von
jagow
to
try
and
pick
up
any
news
the
british
ambassador
sat
in
the
of
the
foreign
office
sir
edward
told
me
that
he
was
there
for
the
purpose
of
asking
for
his
passports
he
spoke
in
english
of
course
and
i
am
sure
that
he
was
overheard
by
a
man
sitting
in
the
room
who
looked
to
me
like
a
german
newspaper
man
so
that
i
was
not
surprised
when
late
in
the
afternoon
extra
sheets
appeared
upon
the
street
announcing
that
the
british
ambassador
had
asked
for
his
passports
and
that
great
britain
had
declared
war
at
this
news
the
rage
of
the
population
of
berlin
was
indescribable
the
foreign
office
had
believed
and
this
belief
had
percolated
through
all
classes
in
the
capital
that
the
english
were
so
occupied
with
the
ulster
rebellion
and
unrest
in
ireland
that
they
would
not
declare
war
illustration
crowds
in

awaiting

august
illustration
the
american
embassy
was
the
centre
of
interest
to
many
in
those
early
days
of
the
war
after
dinner
i
went
to
the
station
to
say
good
bye
to
the
french
ambassador
jules
cambon
the
route
from
the
french
embassy
by
the
branderburg
thor
to
the
lehrter
railway
station
was
lined
with
troops
and
police
so
that
no
accident
whatever
occurred
there
was
no
one
at
the
station
except
a
very
inferior
official
from
the
german
foreign
office
cambon
was
in
excellent
spirits
and
kept
his
nerve
and
composure
admirably
his
family
luckily
were
not
in
berlin
at
the
time
of
the
outbreak
of
the
war
cambon
instead
of
being
sent
out
by
way
of
switzerland
whence
of
course
the
road
to
france
was
easy
was
sent
north
to
denmark
he
was
very
badly
treated
on
the
train
and
payment
for
the
special
train
in
gold
was
exacted
from
him
by
the
german
government
then
i
went
for
a
walk
about
berlin
soon
becoming
involved
in
the
great
crowd
in
front
of
the
british
embassy
on
the
wilhelm
strasse
the
crowd
threw
stones
and
managed
to
break
all
the
windows
of
the
embassy
the
germans
charged
afterwards
that
people
in
the
embassy
had
infuriated
the
crowd
by
throwing
pennies
to
them
i
did
not
see
any
occurrences
of
this
kind
as
the
unter
den
linden
and
the
wilhelm
platz
are
paved
with
asphalt
the
crowd
must
have
brought
with
them
the
missiles
which
they
used
with
the
premeditated
design
of
smashing
the
embassy
windows
a
few
mounted
police
made
their
appearance
but
were
at
no
time
in
sufficient
numbers
to
hold
the
crowd
in
check
afterwards
i
went
around
to
the
unter
den
linden
where
there
was
a
great
crowd
in
front
of
the
hotel
adlon
a
man
standing
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
begged
me
not
to
go
into
the
hotel
as
he
said
the
people
were
looking
for
english
newspaper
correspondents
so
threatening
was
the
crowd
towards
the
english
correspondents
that
wile
rang
up
the
porter
of
the
embassy
after
we
had
gone
to
bed
and
not
wishing
to
disturb
us
he
occupied
the
lounge
in
the
porter
rooms
believing
that
possibly
the
british
embassy
might
be
in
such
a
condition
that
sir
edward
goschen
the
british
ambassador
might
not
care
to
spend
the
night
there
i
ordered
an
automobile
and
went
up
through
the
crowd
which
still
choked
the
wilhelm
strasse
with
holand
harvey
the
second
secretary
to
the
british
embassy
sir
edward
and
his
secretaries
were
perfectly
calm
and
politely
declined
the
refuge
which
i
offered
them
in
our
embassy
i
chatted
with
them
for
a
while
and
as
i
was
starting
to
leave
a
servant
told
me
that
the
crowds
in
the
street
had
greatly
increased
and
were
watching
my
automobile
i
sent
out
word
by
the
servant
to
open
the
automobile
as
it
was
a
landau
and
to
tell
the
chauffeur
when
i
got
in
to
drive
very
slowly
i
drove
slowly
through
the
crowd
assailed
only
by
the
peculiar
hissing
word
that
the
germans
use
when
they
are
especially
angry
and
which
is
supposed
to
convey
the
utmost
contempt
this
word
is
and
has
a
peculiar
effect
when
hissed
out
from
thousands
of
teutonic
throats
as
we
left
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
a
man
of
respectable
appearance
jumped
on
the
running
board
of
the
automobile
spit
at
me
saying
and
struck
harvey
in
the
face
with
his
hat
i
stopped
the
automobile
jumped
out
and
chased
this
man
down
the
street
and
caught
him
my
german
footman
came
running
up
and
explained
that
i
was
the
american
ambassador
and
not
an
englishman
the
man
who
struck
harvey
thereupon
apologised
and
gave
his
card
he
was
a
berlin
lawyer
who
came
to
the
embassy
next
morning
and
apologised
again
for
his
mistake
the
following
day
august
fifth
i
spent
part
of
the
time
taking
over
from
sir
edward
the
british
interests
joseph
grew
our
first
secretary
and
i
went
to
the
british
embassy
seals
were
placed
upon
the
archives
and
we
received
such
instructions
and
information
as
could
be
given
us
with
reference
to
the
british
subjects
in
germany
and
their
interests
the
british
correspondents
were
collected
in
the
embassy
and
permission
was
obtained
for
them
to
leave
on
the
embassy
train
during
the
day
british
subjects
without
distinction
as
to
age
or
sex
were
seized
wherever
found
and
sent
to
the
fortress
of
spandau
i
remonstrated
with
von
jagow
and
told
him
that
that
was
a
measure
taken
only
in
the
middle
ages
and
i
believe
that
he
remonstrated
with
the
authorities
and
arranged
for
a
cessation
of
the
arbitrary
arrests
of
women
frederick
wile
the
american
correspondent
of
the
daily
was
to
go
out
also
with
the
british
party
on
the
ground
that
he
had
been
a
correspondent
of
a
british
newspaper
in
the
evening
i
went
to
the
foreign
office
to
get
his
passport
and
while
one
of
the
department
chiefs
was
signing
the
passport
he
stopped
in
the
middle
of
his
signature
threw
down
the
pen
on
the
table
and
said
he
absolutely
refused
to
sign
a
passport
for
wile
because
he
hated
him
so
and
because
he
believed
he
had
been
largely
instrumental
in
the
bringing
about
of
the
war
of
course
this
latter
statement
was
quite
ridiculous
but
it
took
me
some
time
before
i
could
persuade
this
german
official
to
calm
his
hate
and
complete
his
signature
i
have
heard
a
few
people
say
that
wile
was
unduly
fearful
of
what
the
germans
might
do
to
him
but
the
foregoing
incident
shows
that
his
fears
were
well
grounded
and
knowing
of
this
incident
which
i
did
not
tell
him
i
was
very
glad
to
have
him
accept
the
hospitality
of
the
embassy
for
the
night
preceding
his
departure
he
was
perfectly
cool
although
naturally
much
pleased
when
i
informed
him
that
his
departure
had
been
arranged
sir
edward
and
his
staff
and
the
british
correspondents
left
next
morning
early
about
six
no
untoward
incidents
occurred
at
the
time
of
their
departure
which
was
of
course
unknown
to
the
populace
of
berlin
during
these
first
days
there
was
a
great
spy
excitement
in
germany
people
were
seized
by
the
crowds
in
the
streets
and
in
some
instances
on
the
theory
that
they
were
french
or
russian
spies
were
shot
foreigners
were
in
a
very
dangerous
situation
throughout
germany
and
many
americans
were
subjected
to
arrest
and
indignities
a
curious
rumour
spread
all
over
germany
to
the
effect
that
automobiles
loaded
with
french
gold
were
being
rushed
across
the
country
to
russia
peasants
and
gamekeepers
and
others
turned
out
on
the
roads
with
guns
and
travelling
by
automobile
became
exceedingly
dangerous
a
german
countess
was
shot
an
officer
wounded
and
the
duchess
of
ratibor
was
shot
in
the
arm
it
was
sometime
before
this
excitement
was
allayed
and
many
notices
were
published
in
the
newspapers
before
this
mania
was
driven
from
the
popular
brain
there
were
rumours
also
that
russians
had
poisoned
the
muggelsee
the
lake
from
whence
berlin
draws
part
of
its
water
supply
there
were
constant
rumours
of
the
arrest
of
russian
spies
disguised
as
women
throughout
germany
many
americans
were
detained
under
a
sort
of
arrest
in
their
hotels
among
these
were
archer
huntington
and
his
wife
charles
sherrill
formerly
our
minister
to
the
argentine
and
many
others
chapter
ix
the
americans
at
the
outbreak
of
hostilities
of
course
as
soon
as
there
was
a
prospect
of
war
the
embassy
was
overrun
with
americans
few
americans
had
taken
the
precaution
of
travelling
with
passports
and
passports
had
become
a
necessity
all
of
the
embassy
force
and
all
the
volunteers
that
i
could
prevail
upon
to
serve
even
a
child
of
eleven
years
old
who
was
stopping
in
the
house
with
us
were
taking
applications
of
the
americans
who
literally
in
thousands
crowded
the
wilhelm
platz
in
front
of
the
embassy
the
question
of
money
became
acute
travellers
who
had
letters
of
credit
and
bank
checks
for
large
sums
could
not
get
a
cent
of
money
in
germany
the
american
express
company
i
believe
paid
all
holders
of
its
checks
when
with
wolf
president
of
the
american
association
of
commerce
and
trade
in
berlin
i
called
upon
the
director
of
the
imperial
bank
and
begged
him
to
arrange
something
for
the
relief
of
american
travellers
in
germany
he
refused
to
do
anything
and
i
then
suggested
to
him
that
he
might
give
paper
money
which
they
were
then
printing
in
germany
to
the
americans
for
good
american
credits
such
as
letters
of
credit
and
bank
checks
and
that
they
would
then
have
a
credit
in
america
which
might
become
very
valuable
in
the
future
he
however
refused
to
see
this
director
herbert
gutmann
of
the
dresdener
bank
was
the
banker
who
relieved
the
situation
gutmann
arranged
with
me
that
the
dresdener
bank
the
second
largest
bank
in
germany
would
cash
the
bank
checks
letters
of
credit
and
the
american
express
company
drafts
and
international
business
checks
of
americans
for
reasonable
amounts
provided
the
embassy
seal
was
put
on
the
letter
of
credit
or
check
to
show
that
the
holder
was
an
american
and
outside
of
berlin
the
seal
of
the
american
consulate
this
immediately
relieved
the
situation
with
the
exception
of
wolf
who
was
however
quite
busy
with
his
own
affairs
i
had
no
american
committees
such
as
were
organised
in
london
and
paris
to
help
me
in
berlin
in
munich
however
the
americans
there
organised
themselves
into
an
efficient
committee
and
ralph
pulitzer
were
in
berlin
and
immediately
went
to
work
in
our
embassy
pulitzer
busied
himself
at
giving
out
passports
and
pulitzer
proved
herself
a
very
efficient
worker
she
and
ruddock
wife
of
our
third
secretary
and
gherhardi
wife
of
the
naval
attaché
with
gerard
formed
a
sort
of
relief
committee
to
look
after
the
americans
who
were
without
help
or
resources
i
arranged
with
the
very
efficient
help
of
lanier
winslow
for
special
trains
to
carry
the
americans
in
germany
to
holland
trains
were
run
from
switzerland
munich
and
carlsbad
across
germany
to
holland
and
from
berlin
were
run
a
number
of
trains
to
holland
the
first
room
on
entering
the
embassy
was
the
and
there
first
winslow
and
afterwards
captain
fenton
sold
tickets
giving
tickets
free
to
those
who
were
certified
to
be
without
funds
by
the
committee
of
pulitzer
and
gerard
this
committee
worked
on
the
second
floor
of
the
embassy
in
the
ballroom
part
of
it
being
roped
off
to
keep
the
crowds
back
from
the
ladies
each
week
i
bought
a
number
of
steerage
passages
from
the
holland
american
line
and
the
ladies
resold
them
in
the
ballroom
we
had
to
do
this
because
the
holland
american
line
had
no
licence
to
sell
steerage
tickets
in
germany
but
by
buying
two
or
three
hundred
at
a
time
direct
from
the
company
i
was
enabled
to
peddle
them
out
in
our
ballroom
to
those
americans
who
in
their
eagerness
to
reach
their
own
country
were
willing
to
endure
the
discomforts
of
travel
in
the
steerage
winslow
accompanied
one
special
train
to
holland
and
i
must
say
that
i
sympathised
with
him
when
i
learned
of
what
he
had
to
do
in
the
way
of
chasing
lost
and
finding
milk
for
crying
babies
these
special
trains
were
started
from
the
charlottenburg
station
in
a
quiet
part
of
berlin
so
that
no
crowd
was
attracted
by
the
departure
of
the
americans
the
carlsbad
train
went
through
very
successfully
taking
the
americans
who
had
been
shut
up
in
carlsbad
since
the
commencement
of
the
war
one
of
the
curious
developments
of
this
time
was
a
meeting
of
sympathy
for
the
americans
stranded
in
germany
held
in
the
town
hall
of
berlin
on
the
eleventh
of
august
this
meeting
was
commenced
in
one
of
the
meeting
rooms
of
the
town
hall
but
so
many
people
attended
that
we
were
compelled
to
adjourn
to
the
great
hall
there
speeches
were
made
by
the
von
gwinner
professor
von
harnack
and
me
another
professor
who
spoke
excellent
english
with
an
english
accent
made
a
bitter
attack
upon
great
britain
in
the
pamphlet
in
which
the
speeches
of
harnack
and
the
were
published
this
professor
speech
was
left
out
in
his
speech
stating
the
object
of
the
meeting
the
said
since
we
hear
that
a
large
number
of
american
citizens
in
the
german
empire
and
especially
in
berlin
find
themselves
in
embarrassments
due
to
the
shutting
off
of
means
of
return
to
their
own
country
we
here
solemnly
declare
it
to
be
our
duty
to
care
for
them
as
brethren
to
the
limit
of
our
ability
and
we
appeal
to
all
citizens
of
berlin
and
the
whole
of
the
german
empire
to
with
us
to
this
end
professor
von
harnack
head
of
the
royal
library
in
berlin
is
one
of
the
ablest
of
the
german
professors
in
his
speech
he
gave
expression
to
the
feeling
that
was
prevalent
in
the
first
days
of
the
war
that
germany
was
defending
itself
against
a
russian
invasion
which
threatened
to
blot
out
the
german
he
said
after
referring
to
western
civilisation
but
in
the
face
of
this
civilisation
there
arises
now
before
my
eyes
another
civilisation
the
civilisation
of
the
tribe
with
its
patriarchal
organisation
the
civilisation
of
the
horde
that
is
gathered
and
kept
together
by
despots
the
mongolian
muscovite
civilisation
this
civilisation
could
not
endure
the
light
of
the
eighteenth
century
still
less
the
light
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
now
in
the
twentieth
century
it
breaks
loose
and
threatens
us
this
unorganised
asiatic
mass
like
the
desert
with
its
sands
wants
to
gather
up
our
fields
of
grain
nothing
was
done
for
the
americans
stranded
in
germany
by
the
germans
with
the
exception
of
the
arrangements
for
the
payment
of
funds
by
the
dresdener
bank
on
the
letters
of
credit
and
the
dispatching
of
special
trains
by
the
railroad
department
of
the
german
government
as
a
matter
of
fact
nothing
more
could
have
been
required
of
the
germans
as
it
was
naturally
the
duty
of
the
american
government
to
take
care
of
its
citizens
stranded
abroad
almost
the
instant
that
war
was
declared
i
cabled
to
our
government
suggesting
that
a
ship
should
be
sent
over
with
gold
because
of
course
with
gold
no
matter
what
the
country
necessaries
can
always
be
bought
rumours
of
the
dispatch
of
the
tennessee
and
other
ships
from
america
reached
berlin
and
a
great
number
of
the
more
ignorant
of
the
americans
got
to
believe
that
these
ships
were
being
sent
over
to
take
americans
home

ambassador
gerard
and
his
staff
one
morning
an
american
woman
spoke
to
me
and
said
she
would
consent
to
go
home
on
one
of
these
ships
provided
she
was
given
a
with
a
bath
and
milk
for
her
children
while
another
woman
of
german
extraction
used
to
sit
for
hours
in
a
corner
of
the
ballroom
occasionally
exclaiming
aloud
with
much
feeling
o
god
will
them
ships
never
come
in
these
first
days
of
the
war
we
also
made
a
card
index
of
all
the
americans
in
berlin
and
so
far
as
possible
in
germany
in
order
to
weed
out
those
who
had
received
the
passports
in
the
first
days
when
possibly
some
people
not
entitled
to
them
received
them
and
to
find
the
deserving
cases
all
americans
were
required
to
present
themselves
at
the
embassy
and
answer
a
few
questions
after
which
if
everything
seemed
all
right
their
passports
were
marked
recommended
for
transportation
to
america
i
sent
out
circulars
from

to

no

has
been

purpose
they
should
apply

steps
they
should
take
in
this
regard

are
full
for
some
time
in
advance
the
embassy
is
also
informed
that
the
steamer
from
vlissingen
holland
runs
daily
at
the
ambassador
can
not
however
recommend
americans
to
try
to
reach
holland
by
the
ordinary
schedule
trains
as
he
has
received
reports
of
delays
owing
to
the
fact
that
all
civil
travellers
are
ejected
from
trains
when
troops
require
accommodations
it
is
better
to
wait
for
special
trains
arranged
for
by
the
embassy
the
dresdener
bank
and
its
branches
throughout
germany
will
cash
americans
letters
of

in
this
category
are

and
consuls
must
see
that
the
consular
stamp
is
affixed
to
those
checks
and
letters
of
credit
only
as
are
the
bona

property
of
american
citizens
the
commerz
disconto
bank
makes
the
same
offer
and
the
deutsche
bank
will
cash
checks
and
letters
of
credit
drawn
by
its
correspondents
american
consular
officers
may
also
draw
later
on
the
dresdener
bank
for
their
salaries
and
the
official
expenses
of
their
consulates
before
drawing
such
funds
from
the
bank
however
all
consular
officers
should
submit
their
expense
accounts
to
me
for
approval
these
expense
accounts
should
be
transmitted
to
the
embassy
at
the
earliest
opportunity
the
ambassador
it
will
be
noticed
from
the
above
circular
that
all
americans
were
required
to
have
their
passports
stamped
at
the
foreign
office
one
american
did
not
receive
back
his
passport
although
he
had
left
it
at
the
foreign
office
the
foreign
office
claimed
that
it
had
delivered
the
passport
to
some
one
from
the
embassy
but
we
were
not
very
much
surprised
when
this
identical
passport
turned
up
later
in
the
possession
of
lodi
the
confessed
german
spy
who
was
shot
in
the
tower
of
london
after
a
time
the
american
government
cabled
me
to
advance
money
to
destitute
americans
and
the
ladies
in
the
ballroom
with
their
assistants
attended
to
this
branch
advancing
money
where
needed
or
so
much
as
a
person
needed
to
make
up
the
balance
of
passage
on
steerage
tickets
from
holland
to
the
united
states
at
the
same
time
we
gradually
built
up
a
banking
system
those
in
the
united
states
who
had
friends
or
relatives
in
germany
sent
them
money
by
giving
the
money
to
our
state
department
and
the
state
department
in
turn
cabled
me
to
make
a
payment
this
payment
was
made
by
my
drawing
a
draft
for
the
amount
stated
on
the
state
department
the
recipient
selling
this
draft
at
a
fixed
rate
to
the
deutsche
bank
in
berlin
this
business
assumed
great
proportions
and
after
the
americans
who
were
in
a
hurry
to
go
home
had
disappeared
the
ones
remaining
were
kept
in
funds
by
their
friends
and
relatives
through
this
sort
of
bank
under
our
management
on
august
assistant
secretary
of
war
breckenridge
who
had
come
from
america
on
the
warship
bringing
gold
with
him
and
a
certain
number
of
army
officers
arrived
in
berlin
and
took
over
our
relief
organisation
in
so
far
as
it
applied
to
the
repatriation
of
americans
housing
it
in
rooms
hired
in
a
nearby
hotel
the
kaiserhoff
this
commission
was
composed
of
majors
j
ryan
ford
and
martin
and
captains
miller
and
fenton
but
the
relief
committee
and
the
banking
office
were
still
continued
in
the
embassy
ballroom
a
bulletin
was
published
under
the
auspices
of
the
american
association
of
commerce
and
trade
and
the
advice
there
given
was
that
all
americans
having
the
means
to
leave
should
do
so
when
the
opportunity
for
leaving
by
special
trains
was
presented
and
proceed
direct
to
london
whence
they
could
obtain
transportation
to
the
united
states
all
americans
without
means
were
directed
to
apply
to
the
relief
commission
which
was
authorized
to
pay
for
the
transportation
and
subsistence
of
stranded
americans
in
order
to
enable
them
to
return
home
the
enormous
quantity
of
baggage
left
behind
by
americans
in
germany
was
a
problem
requiring
solution
in
spite
of
repeated
advice
to
leave
many
americans
insisted
on
remaining
in
germany
few
of
them
were
business
people
there
were
many
piano
players
and
students
we
had
much
trouble
with
these
belated
americans
for
example
one
woman
and
her
daughter
refused
to
leave
when
advised
but
stayed
on
and
ran
up
bills
for
over
ten
thousand
marks
and
as
arrest
for
debt
exists
in
germany
they
could
not
leave
when
they
finally
decided
to
go
all
of
us
in
the
embassy
had
to
subscribe
the
money
necessary
to
pay
their
most
pressing
debts
and
they
finally
left
the
country
leaving
an
added
prejudice
against
americans
chapter
x
prisoners
of
war
during
the
period
of
the
first
months
of
the
war
in
addition
to
other
work
it
became
necessary
to
look
after
those
subjects
of
other
nations
who
had
been
confided
to
my
care
at
first
the
british
were
allowed
considerable
liberty
although
none
were
permitted
to
leave
the
country
they
were
required
to
report
to
the
police
at
stated
times
during
the
day
and
could
not
remain
out
late
at
night
the
japanese
had
received
warning
from
their
embassy
as
to
the
turn
that
events
might
take
and
before
sending
its
ultimatum
the
japanese
government
had
warned
its
citizens
so
that
a
great
number
of
them
had
left
germany
after
the
declaration
of
war
by
japan
all
the
japanese
in
germany
were
immediately
imprisoned
this
was
stated
to
be
in
order
to
save
them
from
the
fury
of
the
population
and
certainly
the
people
seemed
to
be
greatly
incensed
against
the
japanese
when
i
finally
obtained
permission
for
their
release
and
departure
from
germany
i
had
to
send
some
one
with
the
parties
of
japanese
to
the
swiss
frontier
in
order
to
protect
them
from
injury
they
were
permitted
to
leave
only
through
switzerland
and
therefore
had
to
change
cars
at
munich
before
sending
any
of
them
to
munich
i
invariably
telegraphed
our
consul
there
to
notify
the
munich
police
so
that
proper
protection
could
be
provided
at
the
railway
station
on
one
occasion
a
number
of
japanese
were
waiting
in
the
embassy
in
order
to
take
the
night
train
for
munich
i
sent
a
servant
to
take
them
out
in
order
that
they
might
get
something
to
eat
in
a
restaurant
but
as
no
restaurant
in
berlin
would
sell
them
food
arrangements
were
made
to
give
them
meals
in
the
embassy
the
members
of
the
siamese
legation
who
in
appearance
greatly
resemble
the
japanese
were
often
subjected
to
indignities
and
for
a
long
time
did
not
dare
move
about
freely
in
berlin
or
even
leave
their
houses
the
japanese
were
marvels
of
courtesy
after
i
visited
some
of
them
at
the
civilian
camp
of
ruhleben
they
wrote
me
a
letter
thanking
me
for
the
visit
nearly
every
japanese
leaving
germany
on
his
arrival
in
switzerland
wrote
me
a
grateful
letter
when
i
finally
left
germany
as
i
stepped
from
the
special
train
at
zürich
a
japanese
woman
who
had
been
imprisoned
in
germany
and
whose
husband
i
had
visited
in
a
prison
came
forward
to
thank
me
a
japanese
man
was
waiting
in
the
hotel
office
in
berne
when
i
arrived
there
for
a
similar
purpose
and
the
next
morning
early
the
japanese
minister
called
and
left
a
beautiful
clock
for
gerard
as
an
expression
of
his
gratitude
for
the
attention
shown
to
his
countrymen
it
was
really
a
pleasure
to
be
able
to
do
something
for
these
polite
and
charming
people
on
august
twentieth
i
paid
my
first
visit
to
a
german
prison
camp
this
was
to
the
camp
at
doeberitz
situated
about
eight
miles
west
of
berlin
a
sort
of
military
camp
with
permanent
barracks
some
of
these
barracks
were
used
for
the
confinement
of
such
british
civilians
as
the
germans
had
arrested
in
the
first
days
of
the
war
there
were
only
a
few
british
among
the
prisoners
with
a
number
of
russian
and
french
i
was
allowed
to
converse
freely
with
the
prisoners
and
found
that
they
had
no
complaints
as
the
war
went
on
however
a
number
of
british
prisoners
of
war
were
taken
by
the
germans
during
the
course
of
the
great
retreat
of
the
british
in
northern
france
then
officers
and
privates
began
to
come
into
germany
and
were
distributed
in
various
camps
finally
in
the
autumn
of
the
british
government
decided
on
interning
a
great
number
of
germans
in
great
britain
and
the
german
government
immediately
and
as
a
reprisal
interned
all
the
british
civilian
men
who
up
to
this
time
had
enjoyed
comparative
freedom
in
berlin
and
other
cities
of
the
empire
the
british
civilians
were
shut
up
in
a
race
track
about
five
miles
from
the
centre
of
berlin
called
ruhleben
this
race
track
in
peace
times
was
used
for
contests
of
trotting
horses
and
on
it
were
the
usual
grandstands
and
brick
stable
buildings
containing
box
stalls
with
hay
lofts
above
where
the
race
horses
were
kept
on
august
twentieth
i
paid
my
first
visit
to
the
police
presidency
in
berlin
where
political
prisoners
when
arrested
were
confined
a
small
number
of
british
prisoners
subject
to
especial
investigation
were
there
interned
this
prison
which
i
often
subsequently
visited
was
clean
and
well
kept
and
i
never
had
any
particular
complaints
from
the
prisoners
confined
there
except
of
course
as
the
war
progressed
concerning
the
inadequacy
of
the
food
i
had
organised
a
special
department
immediately
on
the
breaking
out
of
the
war
to
care
for
the
interests
of
the
british
at
first
boylston
beal
a
lawyer
of
boston
assisted
by
rivington
pyne
of
new
york
was
at
the
head
of
this
department
of
which
later
the
honourable
john
jackson
formerly
our
minister
to
the
balkan
states
greece
and
cuba
took
charge
he
volunteered
to
give
his
assistance
at
the
commencement
of
the
war
and
i
was
glad
of
his
help
especially
as
he
had
been
twelve
years
secretary
in
the
berlin
embassy
and
therefore
was
well
acquainted
not
only
with
germany
but
with
german
official
life
and
customs
jackson
was
most
ably
assisted
by
charles
russell
of
new
york
and
lithgow
osborne
of
course
others
in
the
embassy
had
much
to
do
with
this
department
the
first
privates
prisoners
of
war
came
to
the
camp
of
doeberitz
near
berlin
early
in
the
war
mr
grew
our
first
secretary
and
consul
general
lay
visited
the
camp
for
officers
at
torgau
the
question
of
the
inspection
of
prisoners
of
the
camps
and
the
rights
of
ambassadors
charged
with
the
interests
of
hostile
powers
was
quite
in
the
clouds
so
many
reports
came
to
germany
about
the
bad
treatment
in
england
of
german
prisoners
of
war
that
i
finally
arranged
to
have
jackson
visit
them
and
report
this
was
arranged
by
my
colleague
our
ambassador
to
great
britain
and
in
the
first
winter
jackson
made
his
trip
there
his
report
of
conditions
there
did
much
to
allay
the
german
belief
as
to
the
of
their
subjects
who
were
prisoners
in
great
britain
and
helped
me
greatly
in
bringing
about
better
conditions
in
germany
after
vainly
endeavouring
to
get
the
german
government
to
agree
to
some
definite
plan
for
the
inspection
of
the
prisoners
after
my
notes
to
the
foreign
office
had
remained
unanswered
for
a
long
period
of
time
and
after
sending
a
personal
letter
to
von
jagow
calling
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
delay
was
injuring
german
prisoners
in
other
countries
i
finally
called
on
von
and
told
him
that
my
notes
concerning
prisoners
were
sent
by
the
foreign
office
to
the
military
authorities
that
while
i
could
talk
with
officials
of
the
foreign
office
i
never
came
into
contact
with
the
people
who
really
passed
upon
the
notes
sent
by
me
and
who
made
the
decisions
as
to
the
treatment
of
prisoners
of
war
and
inspection
of
their
camps
and
i
begged
the
chancellor
to
break
down
diplomatic
precedent
and
allow
me
to
speak
with
the
military
authorities
who
decided
these
questions
i
said
if
i
can
not
get
an
answer
to
my
proposition
about
prisoners
i
will
take
a
chair
and
sit
in
front
of
your
palace
in
the
street
until
i
receive
an
answer
the
result
was
a
meeting
in
my
office
i
discussed
the
question
involved
with
two
representatives
from
the
foreign
office
two
from
the
general
staff
two
from
the
war
department
and
with
count
schwerin
who
commanded
the
civilian
camp
at
the
ruhleben
race
track
in
twenty
minutes
we
managed
to
reach
an
agreement
which
i
then
and
there
drew
up
the
substance
of
which
as
between
great
britain
and
germany
was
that
the
american
ambassador
and
his
representatives
in
germany
and
the
american
ambassador
and
his
representatives
in
great
britain
should
have
the
right
to
visit
the
prison
camps
on
giving
reasonable
notice
which
was
to
be
hours
where
possible
and
should
have
the
right
to
converse
with
the
prisoners
within
sight
but
out
of
hearing
of
the
camp
officials
that
an
endeavour
should
be
made
to
adjust
matters
complained
of
with
the
camp
authorities
before
bringing
them
to
the
notice
of
higher
authorities
that
ten
representatives
should
be
named
by
our
ambassador
and
that
these
should
receive
passes
enabling
them
to
visit
the
camps
under
the
conditions
above
stated
this
agreement
was
ratified
by
the
british
and
german
governments
and
thereafter
for
a
long
time
we
worked
under
its
provisions
and
in
most
questions
dealt
direct
with
the
war
department
of
course
before
this
meeting
i
had
managed
to
get
permission
to
visit
the
camps
of
ruhleben
and
doeberitz
near
berlin
and
michaelson
our
consul
at
cologne
and
jackson
and
others
at
the
embassy
had
been
permitted
to
visit
certain
camps
but
immediately
preceding
the
meeting
on
the
fourth
of
march
and
while
matters
were
still
being
discussed
we
were
compelled
to
a
certain
extent
to
suspend
our
visits
in
the
first
days
of
the
war
it
was
undoubtedly
and
unfortunately
true
that
prisoners
of
war
taken
by
the
germans
both
at
the
time
of
their
capture
and
in
transit
to
the
prison
camps
were
often
badly
treated
by
the
soldiers
guards
or
the
civil
population
the
instances
were
too
numerous
the
evidence
too
overwhelming
to
be
denied
in
the
prison
camps
themselves
owing
to
the
peculiar
system
of
military
government
in
germany
the
treatment
of
the
prisoners
varied
greatly
as
i
have
i
think
stated
in
another
place
germany
is
divided
into
army
corps
districts
over
each
of
these
districts
is
in
time
of
war
a
representative
corps
commander
who
is
clothed
with
absolute
power
in
that
district
his
orders
superseding
those
of
all
civilian
officials
these
corps
commanders
do
not
report
to
the
war
department
but
are
in
a
measure
independent
and
very
jealous
of
their
rights
for
instance
to
show
the
difficulty
of
dealing
with
these
corps
commanders
after
my
arrangements
concerning
the
inspection
of
prisoners
of
war
had
been
ratified
by
both
the
imperial
and
british
governments
i
went
to
halle
to
inspect
the
place
of
detention
for
officers
there
halle
is
some
hours
from
berlin
and
when
i
had
driven
out
to
the
camp
i
was
met
by
the
commander
who
told
me
that
i
might
visit
the
camp
but
that
i
could
not
speak
to
the
prisoners
out
of
hearing
i
told
him
that
our
arrangement
was
otherwise
but
as
he
remained
firm
i
returned
to
berlin
i
complained
to
the
foreign
office
and
was
told
there
that
the
matter
would
be
arranged
and
so
i
again
some
days
later
returned
to
halle
my
experience
on
the
second
trip
was
exactly
the
same
as
the
first
i
spoke
to
von
jagow
who
explained
the
situation
to
me
and
advised
me
to
visit
first
the
corps
commander
at
magdeburg
and
try
and
arrange
the
matter
with
him
i
did
so
and
was
finally
permitted
to
visit
this
camp
and
to
talk
to
the
officers
out
of
this
camp
of
halle
was
continued
during
the
war
although
not
at
all
a
fit
place
for
the
detention
of
officers
who
were
lodged
in
the
old
factory
buildings
surrounded
by
a
sort
of
courtyard
covered
with
cinders
this
building
was
situated
in
the
industrial
part
of
the
town
of
halle
there
was
no
opportunity
for
recreation
or
games
although
several
enterprising
officers
had
tried
to
arrange
a
place
where
they
could
knock
a
tennis
ball
against
the
wall
it
was
the
policy
of
the
germans
to
put
some
prisoners
of
each
nation
in
each
camp
this
was
probably
so
that
no
claim
could
be
made
that
the
prisoners
from
one
nation
among
the
allies
were
treated
better
or
worse
than
the
prisoners
from
another
nation
in
the
beginning
of
the
war
the
germans
were
surprised
by
the
great
number
of
prisoners
taken
and
had
made
no
adequate
preparations
for
their
reception
clothing
and
blankets
were
woefully
wanting
so
i
immediately
bought
what
i
could
in
the
way
of
underclothes
and
blankets
at
the
large
department
stores
of
berlin
and
the
wholesalers
and
sent
these
to
the
camps
where
the
british
prisoners
were
confined
i
also
sent
to
the
doeberitz
camp
articles
such
as
sticks
for
wounded
men
who
were
recovering
and
crutches
and
even
eggs
and
other
nourishing
delicacies
for
the
sick
at
first
the
prisoners
were
not
compelled
to
work
to
any
extent
but
at
the
time
i
left
germany
the
two
million
prisoners
of
war
were
materially
assisting
the
carrying
on
of
the
agriculture
and
industries
of
the
empire
the
league
of
mercy
of
new
york
having
telegraphed
me
in
asking
in
what
way
funds
could
best
be
used
in
the
war
i
suggested
in
answer
that
funds
for
the
prisoners
of
war
were
urgently
needed
many
newspapers
poked
fun
at
me
for
this
suggestion
and
one
bright
editor
said
that
if
the
germans
did
not
treat
their
prisoners
properly
they
should
be
made
to
of
course
unless
this
particular
editor
had
sailed
up
the
spree
in
a
canoe
and
bombarded
the
royal
palace
i
know
of
no
other
way
of
making
the
germans
do
anything
the
idea
however
of
doing
some
work
for
the
prisoners
of
war
was
taken
up
by
the
young
men
christian
association
john
mott
was
at
the
head
of
this
work
and
was
most
ably
and
devotedly
assisted
by
the
rev
archibald
harte
i
shall
give
an
account
of
their
splendid
work
in
a
chapter
devoted
to
the
charitable
work
of
the
war
at
only
one
town
in
germany
was
any
interest
in
the
fate
of
the
prisoners
of
war
evinced
this
was
i
am
glad
to
say
in
the
quaint
university
town
of
göttingen
i
visited
this
camp
with
harte
in
april
to
attend
the
opening
of
the
first
camp
building
in
germany
the
camp
was
commanded
by
colonel
bogen
an
officer
strict
in
his
discipline
but
as
all
the
prisoners
admitted
just
in
his
dealings
with
them
there
were
as
i
recall
about
seven
thousand
prisoners
in
this
camp
russian
french
belgian
and
british
it
is
a
pity
that
the
methods
of
colonel
bogen
and
his
arrangements
for
camp
buildings
were
not
copied
in
other
camps
in
germany
here
as
i
have
said
the
civil
population
took
some
interest
in
the
fate
of
the
unfortunate
prisoners
within
their
gates
led
in
this
by
several
professors
in
the
university
the
most
active
of
these
professors
was
professor
stange
who
working
with
a
french
lawyer
who
had
been
captured
near
arras
while
in
the
red
cross
provided
a
library
for
the
prisoners
and
otherwise
helped
them
of
course
these
charitable
acts
of
professor
stange
did
not
find
favor
with
many
of
his
fellow
townsmen
of
göttingen
and
he
was
not
surprised
when
he
awoke
one
morning
to
find
that
during
the
night
his
house
had
been
painted
red
white
and
blue
the
colours
of
france
england
and
america
i
heard
of
so
many
instances
of
the
annoyance
of
prisoners
by
the
civil
population
that
i
was
quite
pleased
one
day
to
read
a
paragraph
in
the
official
newspaper
the
german
which
ran
somewhat
as
follows
the
following
inhabitants
of
naming
a
small
town
near
the
borders
of
denmark
having
been
guilty
of
improper
conduct
towards
prisoners
of
war
have
been
sentenced
to
the
following
terms
of
imprisonment
and
the
following
fines
and
their
names
are
printed
here
in
order
that
they
may
be
held
up
to
the
contempt
of
all
future
generations
of
germans
and
then
followed
a
list
of
names
and
terms
of
imprisonment
and
fines
i
thought
that
this
was
splendid
that
the
german
government
had
at
last
been
aroused
to
the
necessity
of
protecting
their
prisoners
of
war
from
the
annoyances
of
the
civil
population
and
i
wrote
to
our
consul
in
kiel
and
asked
him
to
investigate
the
case
from
him
i
learned
that
some
unfortunate
prisoners
passing
through
the
town
in
a
part
of
germany
inhabited
by
scandinavians
had
made
signs
that
they
were
suffering
from
hunger
and
thirst
that
some
of
the
people
among
the
scandinavian
population
had
given
them
something
to
eat
and
drink
and
for
this
they
were
condemned
to
fines
to
prison
and
to
have
their
names
held
up
to
the
contempt
of
germans
for
all
time
i
do
not
know
of
anyone
thing
that
can
give
a
better
idea
of
the
official
hate
for
the
nations
with
which
germany
was
at
war
than
this
the
day
after
visiting
the
camp
at
göttingen
i
visited
the
officers
camp
situated
at
the
town
of
hanover
münden
here
about
eight
hundred
officers
of
whom
only
thirteen
were
british
were
confined
in
an
old
factory
building
situated
on
the
bank
of
the
river
below
the
town
the
russian
officers
handed
me
some
arrows
tipped
with
nails
which
had
been
shot
at
them
by
the
little
town
boys
and
the
british
pointed
out
to
me
the
filthy
conditions
of
the
camp
in
this
as
in
unfortunately
many
other
officer
camps
the
inclination
seemed
to
be
to
treat
the
officers
not
as
captured
officers
and
gentlemen
but
as
convicts
i
had
quite
a
sharp
talk
with
the
commander
of
this
camp
before
leaving
and
he
afterwards
took
violent
exception
to
the
report
which
i
made
upon
his
camp
however
i
am
pleased
to
say
that
he
reformed
as
it
were
and
i
was
informed
by
my
inspectors
that
he
had
finally
made
his
camp
one
of
the
best
in
germany
much
as
i
should
have
liked
to
i
could
not
spend
much
time
myself
in
visiting
the
prison
camps
many
duties
and
frequent
crises
kept
me
in
berlin
but
members
of
the
embassy
were
always
travelling
in
this
work
of
camp
inspection
for
some
time
my
reports
were
published
in
parliamentary
white
papers
but
in
the
end
our
government
found
that
the
publication
of
these
reports
irritated
the
germans
to
such
a
degree
that
the
british
government
was
requested
not
to
publish
them
any
more
copies
of
the
reports
were
always
sent
by
me
both
to
washington
and
to
london
and
handed
to
the
berlin
foreign
office
illustration
a
cover
of
the
monthly
issued
by
the
ruhleben
prisoners
while
winston
churchill
was
at
the
head
of
the
british
admiralty
it
was
stated
that
the
german
submarine
prisoners
would
not
be
treated
as
ordinary
prisoners
of
war
but
would
be
put
in
a
place
by
themselves
on
the
ground
that
they
were
pirates
and
murderers
and
not
entitled
to
the
treatment
accorded
in
general
to
prisoners
of
war
great
indignation
was
excited
by
this
in
germany
the
german
government
immediately
seized
officers
picking
those
whom
they
supposed
related
to
the
most
prominent
families
in
great
britain
and
placed
them
in
solitary
confinement
a
few
were
confined
in
this
way
in
cologne
but
the
majority
were
put
in
the
ordinary
jails
of
magdeburg
and
burg
as
soon
as
i
heard
of
this
accompanied
by
charles
russell
of
my
staff
i
went
to
magdeburg
using
my
ordinary
pass
for
the
visiting
of
prisoners
the
german
authorities
told
me
afterwards
that
if
they
had
known
i
was
going
to
make
this
visit
they
would
not
have
permitted
it
but
on
this
occasion
the
corps
commander
system
worked
for
me
accompanied
by
an
adjutant
in
peace
times
a
local
lawyer
from
the
corps
commander
office
in
magdeburg
and
other
officers
i
visited
these
british
officers
in
their
cells
in
the
common
jail
at
magdeburg
they
were
in
absolutely
solitary
confinement
each
in
a
small
cell
about
eleven
feet
long
and
four
feet
wide
some
cells
were
a
little
larger
and
the
prisoners
were
allowed
only
one
hour
exercise
a
day
in
the
courtyard
of
the
prison
the
food
given
them
was
not
bad
but
the
close
confinement
was
very
trying
especially
to
lieutenant
goschen
son
of
the
former
ambassador
to
germany
who
had
been
wounded
and
in
the
hospital
at
douai
among
them
i
found
an
old
acquaintance
captain
robin
grey
who
had
been
often
in
new
york
the
german
authorities
agreed
to
correct
several
minor
matters
of
which
the
officers
complained
and
then
we
went
to
the
neighbouring
town
of
burg
where
other
officers
were
confined
in
the
same
manner
and
under
similar
conditions
in
the
ordinary
jail
after
visiting
these
prisoners
and
obtaining
for
them
from
the
authorities
some
modifications
of
the
rules
which
had
been
established
we
visited
the
regular
officers
camp
at
burg
this
was
at
that
time
what
i
should
call
a
bad
camp
crowded
and
with
no
space
for
recreation
later
conditions
were
improved
and
more
ground
allowed
to
the
prisoners
for
games
etc
at
the
time
of
my
first
visit
i
found
that
the
commander
a
polite
but
peppery
officer
was
in
civil
life
a
judge
of
the
supreme
court
at
leipzig
the
highest
court
in
the
empire
as
i
had
been
a
judge
in
the
state
of
new
york
we
foregathered
and
adjourned
for
lunch
with
his
staff
to
the
hotel
in
burg
after
churchill
left
the
british
admiralty
his
successor
reversed
his
ruling
and
the
submarine
prisoners
were
placed
in
the
ordinary
confinement
of
prisoners
of
war
when
the
germans
were
assured
of
this
the
officers
who
had
been
in
reprisal
placed
in
solitary
confinement
were
sent
back
to
ordinary
prison
camps
in
fact
in
most
cases
i
managed
to
get
the
germans
to
send
them
to
what
were
called
good
camps
lieutenant
goschen
however
became
quite
in
and
was
taken
to
the
hospital
in
magdeburg
at
the
time
of
his
capture
the
germans
had
told
me
in
answer
to
my
inquiries
that
he
was
suffering
from
a
blow
on
the
head
with
the
butt
end
of
a
rifle
but
an
examination
at
magdeburg
showed
that
fragments
of
a
bullet
had
penetrated
his
brain
and
that
he
was
therefore
hardly
a
fit
subject
to
be
chosen
as
one
of
the
reprisal
prisoners
i
told
von
jagow
that
i
thought
it
in
the
first
place
a
violation
of
all
diplomatic
courtesy
to
pick
out
the
son
of
the
former
ambassador
to
germany
as
a
subject
for
reprisals
and
secondly
that
in
picking
him
they
had
taken
a
wounded
man
that
the
fact
that
they
did
not
know
that
he
had
fragments
of
a
bullet
in
his
brain
made
the
situation
even
worse
because
that
ignorance
was
the
result
of
the
want
of
a
proper
examination
in
the
german
hospitals
and
i
insisted
that
because
of
this
manifestly
unfair
treatment
which
had
undoubtedly
caused
the
very
serious
condition
of
lieutenant
goschen
he
should
be
returned
to
england
in
the
exchange
of
those
who
were
badly
wounded
i
am
pleased
to
say
that
von
jagow
saw
my
point
of
view
and
finally
secured
permission
for
lieutenant
goschen
to
leave
for
england
ohnesorg
one
of
our
assistant
naval
attachés
went
with
him
to
england
on
account
of
the
seriousness
of
his
condition
and
i
was
very
glad
to
hear
from
his
father
that
he
had
arrived
safely
in
london
undoubtedly
the
worst
camp
which
i
visited
in
germany
was
that
of
wittenberg
wittenberg
is
the
ancient
town
where
luther
lived
and
nailed
his
theses
to
the
church
door
the
camp
is
situated
just
outside
the
city
in
a
very
unattractive
spot
next
to
the
railway
an
outbreak
of
typhus
fever
prevented
us
from
visiting
the
camp
although
jackson
conversed
with
some
of
the
prisoners
from
outside
the
barrier
of
barbed
wire
when
the
typhus
was
finally
driven
out
lithgow
osborne
visited
the
camp
and
his
report
of
conditions
there
was
such
that
i
visited
it
myself
in
the
meantime
holding
up
his
report
until
i
had
verified
it
with
charles
russell
i
visited
the
camp
typhus
fever
seems
to
be
continually
present
in
russia
it
is
carried
by
the
body
louse
and
it
is
transmitted
from
one
person
to
another
russian
soldiers
seem
to
carry
this
disease
with
them
without
apparently
suffering
much
from
it
themselves
the
russian
soldiers
arriving
at
wittenberg
were
not
properly
disinfected
and
in
consequence
typhus
fever
broke
out
in
camp
several
british
medical
officers
were
there
with
their
prisoners
because
by
the
provisions
of
the
hague
conventions
captured
medical
officers
may
be
kept
with
the
troops
of
their
nation
if
prisoners
have
need
of
their
services
these
medical
officers
protested
with
the
camp
commander
against
the
herding
together
of
the
french
and
british
prisoners
with
the
russians
who
as
i
have
said
were
suffering
from
typhus
fever
but
the
camp
commander
said
you
will
have
to
know
your
allies
and
kept
all
of
his
prisoners
together
and
thus
as
surely
condemned
to
death
a
number
of
french
and
british
prisoners
of
war
as
though
he
had
stood
them
against
the
wall
and
ordered
them
shot
by
a
firing
squad
conditions
in
the
camp
during
the
period
of
this
epidemic
were
frightful
the
camp
was
practically
deserted
by
the
germans
and
i
understand
that
the
german
doctor
did
not
make
as
many
visits
to
the
camp
as
the
situation
required
at
the
time
i
visited
the
camp
the
typhus
epidemic
of
course
had
been
stamped
out
the
germans
employed
a
large
number
of
police
dogs
in
this
camp
and
these
dogs
not
only
were
used
in
watching
the
outside
of
the
camp
in
order
to
prevent
the
escape
of
prisoners
but
also
were
used
within
the
camp
many
complaints
were
made
to
me
by
prisoners
concerning
these
dogs
stating
that
men
had
been
bitten
by
them
it
seemed
undoubtedly
true
that
the
prisoners
there
had
been
knocked
about
and
beaten
in
a
terrible
manner
by
their
guards
and
one
guard
went
so
far
as
to
strike
one
of
the
british
medical
officers
there
were
about
civilian
prisoners
in
the
camp
who
had
been
there
all
through
the
typhus
epidemic
i
secured
the
removal
of
these
civilian
prisoners
to
the
general
civilian
camp
at
ruhleben
and
the
conditions
at
wittenberg
may
be
judged
by
the
fact
that
when
it
was
announced
to
these
civilians
that
they
were
to
be
taken
from
wittenberg
to
another
camp
one
of
them
was
so
excited
by
the
news
of
release
that
he
fell
dead
upon
the
spot
in
talking
over
conditions
at
wittenberg
with
von
jagow
i
said
suppose
i
go
back
to
wittenberg
and
shoot
some
of
these
dogs
what
can
you
do
to
me
soon
after
the
dogs
disappeared
from
the
camp
the
food
in
all
these
camps
for
civilians
and
for
private
soldiers
was
about
the
same
it
consisted
of
an
allowance
of
bread
of
the
same
weight
as
that
given
the
civilian
population
this
was
given
out
in
the
morning
with
a
cup
of
something
called
coffee
but
which
in
reality
was
an
extract
of
acorns
or
something
of
the
kind
without
milk
or
sugar
in
the
middle
of
the
day
a
bowl
of
thick
soup
in
which
the
quantity
of
meat
was
gradually
diminished
as
war
went
on
as
well
as
the
amount
of
potatoes
for
which
at
a
later
period
turnips
and
carrots
were
to
a
large
extent
substituted
and
in
the
evening
in
good
camps
there
was
some
sort
of
thick
soup
given
out
or
an
apple
or
an
almost
infinitesimal
piece
of
cheese
or
sausage
in
the
war
department
at
berlin
there
was
a
prisoners
of
war
department
in
charge
of
colonel
later
general
friedrich
this
department
however
did
not
seem
to
be
in
a
position
to
issue
orders
to
the
corps
commanders
commanding
the
army
corps
districts
of
germany
who
had
absolute
control
of
the
prison
camps
within
their
districts
colonel
friedrich
however
and
his
assistants
endeavoured
to
standardise
the
treatment
of
prisoners
of
war
in
the
different
corps
districts
and
were
able
to
exert
a
certain
amount
of
pressure
on
the
corps
commanders
they
determined
on
the
general
reprisals
to
be
taken
in
connection
with
prisoners
of
war
for
instance
when
some
of
the
germans
who
had
been
taken
prisoners
by
the
british
and
who
were
in
england
were
sent
to
work
in
the
harbour
of
havre
the
germans
retaliated
by
sending
about
four
times
the
number
of
british
prisoners
to
work
at
libau
in
the
part
of
russia
then
occupied
by
the
germans
but
while
the
british
permitted
our
embassy
in
paris
to
inspect
the
prisoners
of
war
at
havre
the
germans
for
months
refused
to
allow
me
permission
to
send
anyone
to
inspect
those
british
prisoners
at
libau
cases
came
to
my
attention
where
individual
corps
commanders
on
their
own
initiative
directed
punitive
measures
against
the
prisoners
of
war
in
their
districts
on
account
of
the
rumours
of
the
bad
treatment
of
german
citizens
in
england
thus
the
commander
in
the
district
where
the
camp
of
doeberitz
was
situated
issued
an
order
directing
reprisals
against
prisoners
under
his
command
on
account
of
what
he
claimed
to
be
the
bad
treatment
of
german
women
in
england
it
required
constant
vigilance
to
seek
out
instances
of
this
kind
and
cause
them
to
be
remedied
i
did
not
find
the
germans
at
all
efficient
in
the
handling
of
prisoners
of
war
the
authority
was
so
divided
that
it
was
hard
to
find
who
was
responsible
for
any
given
bad
conditions
for
instance
for
a
long
period
of
time
i
contended
with
the
german
authorities
for
better
living
conditions
at
the
civilian
camp
of
ruhleben
i
was
promised
time
and
again
by
colonel
friedrich
by
the
camp
commander
and
by
the
foreign
office
that
these
conditions
would
be
remedied
in
that
camp
men
of
education
men
in
delicate
health
were
compelled
to
sleep
and
live
six
in
a
box
stall
or
so
closely
that
the
beds
touched
each
other
in
the
outside
walls
of
which
were
only
four
feet
high
i
finally
almost
in
despair
wrote
identical
personal
letters
after
having
exhausted
all
ordinary
diplomatic
steps
to
general
von
kessel
commander
of
the
mark
of
brandenburg
to
the
commander
of
the
corps
district
in
which
the
ruhleben
camp
was
situated
and
to
the
minister
of
war
and
the
only
result
was
that
each
of
the
officers
addressed
claimed
that
he
had
been
personally
insulted
by
me
because
i
had
presumed
to
call
his
attention
to
the
inhuman
conditions
under
which
the
prisoners
were
compelled
to
live
in
the
ruhleben
camp
the
commander
of
this
civilian
camp
of
ruhleben
was
a
very
handsome
old
gentleman
named
count
schwerin
his
second
in
command
for
a
long
time
was
a
baron
taube
both
of
these
officers
had
been
long
retired
from
the
army
and
were
given
these
prison
commands
at
the
commencement
of
the
war
both
of
them
were
naturally
but
curiously
sensitive
and
not
always
of
even
temper
on
the
whole
i
think
that
they
sympathised
with
the
prisoners
and
did
their
best
to
obtain
a
bettering
of
the
conditions
of
their
confinement
the
prisoners
organised
themselves
in
their
various
barracks
each
barrack
having
a
captain
of
the
barrack
the
captains
electing
one
of
their
number
as
a
camp
captain
or
the
man
who
finally
appeared
as
head
man
of
the
camp
was
an
proprietor
named
powell
in
my
mind
he
assisted
by
beaumont
and
other
captains
conducted
the
affairs
of
the
camp
as
well
as
possible
given
the
difficulty
of
dealing
with
the
prisoners
on
one
hand
and
the
prison
authorities
on
the
other
hand
naturally
he
was
always
subject
to
opposition
from
many
prisoners
among
whom
those
of
aristocratic
tendencies
objected
to
being
under
the
control
of
one
not
of
the
highest
caste
in
great
britain
and
there
were
others
who
either
envied
him
his
authority
or
desired
his
place
the
camp
authorities
allowed
powell
to
visit
the
embassy
at
least
once
a
week
and
in
that
way
i
was
enabled
to
keep
in
direct
touch
with
the
camp
at
two
periods
during
my
stay
in
berlin
i
spent
enough
days
at
the
camp
to
enable
every
prisoner
who
had
a
complaint
of
any
kind
to
present
it
personally
to
me
the
organisation
of
this
camp
was
quite
extraordinary
i
found
it
impossible
to
get
british
prisoners
to
perform
the
ordinary
work
of
cleaning
up
the
camp
and
so
forth
always
expected
of
prisoners
themselves
and
so
with
the
funds
furnished
me
from
the
british
government
the
camp
captain
was
compelled
to
pay
a
number
of
the
poorer
prisoners
to
perform
this
work
secretaries
ruddock
and
kirk
of
our
embassy
undertook
the
uninteresting
and
arduous
work
of
superintending
these
payments
as
well
as
of
our
other
financial
affairs
this
work
was
most
trying
and
they
deserve
great
credit
for
their
by
arrangement
with
the
british
government
i
was
also
enabled
to
pay
the
poorer
prisoners
an
allowance
of
five
marks
a
week
thus
permitting
them
to
buy
little
luxuries
and
necessities
and
extra
food
at
the
camp
canteen
which
was
early
established
in
the
camp
i
also
furnished
the
capital
to
the
camp
canteen
enabling
it
to
make
its
purchases
and
carry
on
its
business
in
this
establishment
everything
could
be
purchased
which
was
purchasable
in
germany
and
for
months
after
the
commencement
of
the
war
articles
of
luxury
were
sold
at
a
profit
and
articles
of
food
sold
at
a
loss
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
required
an
addition
to
the
camp
diet
there
was
a
street
in
the
camp
of
little
barracks
or
booths
which
the
prisoners
christened
bond
street
and
where
many
stores
were
in
operation
such
as
a
tailor
shop
etc
acting
with
powell
i
succeeded
in
getting
the
german
authorities
to
turn
over
the
kitchens
to
the
prisoners
four
of
the
prisoners
who
did
most
excellent
work
in
these
kitchens
deserve
to
be
specially
mentioned
they
were
ernest
pyke
herbert
kasmer
richard
carrad
and
george
fergusson
the
men
in
this
camp
subsisted
to
a
great
extent
upon
the
packages
of
food
sent
to
them
from
england
credit
must
be
given
to
the
german
authorities
for
the
fairly
prompt
and
efficient
delivery
of
the
packages
of
food
sent
from
england
denmark
and
switzerland
to
prisoners
of
war
in
all
camps
in
ruhleben
the
educated
prisoners
volunteered
to
teach
the
ignorant
two
hundred
and
different
educational
courses
were
offered
to
those
who
desired
to
improve
their
minds
a
splendid
orchestra
was
organised
a
dramatic
society
which
gave
plays
in
french
and
one
which
gave
plays
in
english
and
another
one
which
gave
operas
on
new
year
day
i
attended
at
ruhleben
do
really
wonderful
performance
of
the
pantomime
of
cinderella
and
in
january
a
performance
of
the
mikado
in
a
theatre
under
one
of
the
grand
stands
in
these
productions
of
course
the
female
parts
were
taken
by
young
men
and
the
scenery
costumes
and
accessories
were
all
made
by
the
prisoners
there
was
a
camp
library
of
over
five
thousand
volumes
sent
over
by
the
british
government
and
a
reading
and
meeting
hall
erected
by
the
american
a
there
was
even
a
system
of
postal
service
with
special
stamps
so
that
a
prisoner
in
one
barrack
could
write
to
a
friend
in
another
and
have
a
letter
delivered
by
the
camp
postal
authorities
the
german
authorities
had
not
hired
the
entire
race
track
from
the
race
track
association
so
that
i
made
a
special
contract
with
the
race
track
owners
and
hired
from
them
the
and
other
portions
not
taken
over
by
german
authorities
here
the
prisoners
had
tennis
courts
and
played
hockey
and
cricket
and
held
athletic
games
expert
dentists
in
the
camp
took
care
of
the
poorer
prisoners
as
did
an
oculist
hired
by
me
with
british
funds
and
glasses
were
given
them
from
the
same
funds
the
prisoners
who
needed
a
little
better
nourishment
than
that
afforded
by
the
camp
diet
and
their
parcels
from
england
could
obtain
cards
giving
them
the
right
to
eat
in
the
casino
or
camp
official
restaurant
where
they
were
allowed
a
certain
indicated
amount
of
wine
or
beer
with
their
meals
and
finally
arrangements
were
arrived
at
by
which
the
german
guards
left
the
camp
simply
guarding
it
from
the
outside
and
the
policing
was
taken
over
by
the
camp
police
department
under
the
charge
of
the
prison
camp
commander
and
committee
the
worst
features
of
course
were
the
food
and
housing
human
nature
seems
always
to
be
the
same
establishment
of
clubs
seems
inherent
to
the
nature
ten
or
more
persons
would
combine
together
and
erect
a
sort
of
wooden
shed
against
the
brick
walls
of
a
barrack
hire
some
poorer
person
to
put
on
a
white
jacket
and
be
addressed
as
steward
put
in
the
shed
a
few
deck
chairs
and
a
table
and
enjoy
the
sensation
of
exclusiveness
and
club
life
thereby
given
owing
to
the
failure
of
germany
and
great
britain
to
come
to
an
agreement
for
a
long
time
as
to
the
release
of
captured
crews
of
ships
there
were
in
ruhleben
men
as
old
as
years
and
boys
as
young
as
fifteen
there
were
in
all
between
fifty
and
sixty
of
these
ships
boys
they
lived
in
a
barrack
by
themselves
and
under
the
supervision
of
a
ship
officer
who
volunteered
to
look
after
them
as
sort
of
a
monitor
they
were
taught
navigation
by
the
older
prisoners
and
i
imagine
were
rather
benefited
by
their
stay
in
the
camp
i
finally
made
arrangements
by
which
these
boys
were
released
from
england
and
germany
with
the
exception
of
the
officers
and
crews
of
the
ships
prisoners
were
not
interned
who
were
over
the
british
government
was
generous
in
the
allowance
of
money
for
ruhleben
prisoners
the
amount
allowed
by
the
german
government
to
the
camp
commanders
for
feeding
the
prisoners
was
extremely
small
only
sixty
pfennigs
a
day
at
first
many
of
the
camp
commanders
made
contracts
with
caterers
for
the
feeding
of
the
prisoners
and
as
the
caterers
profit
had
to
come
out
of
this
very
small
sum
the
amount
of
food
which
the
remainder
purchased
for
the
prisoners
was
small
indeed
as
the
war
went
on
the
department
of
the
war
office
tried
to
induce
the
camp
commanders
to
abandon
the
contractors
system
and
purchase
supplies
themselves
a
sort
of
convention
of
camp
commanders
was
held
in
berlin
which
i
attended
lectures
were
there
given
on
food
and
its
purchase
and
methods
of
disinfecting
prisoners
on
providing
against
typhus
and
on
housing
and
other
subjects
a
daily
lunch
was
served
supposed
to
be
composed
of
the
exact
rations
given
at
the
prison
camps
the
schedules
of
food
made
out
by
the
camp
commanders
and
furnished
to
foreign
correspondents
were
often
not
followed
in
practice
i
know
on
one
occasion
when
i
was
at
the
camp
at
doeberitz
the
camp
commander
gave
me
his
schedule
of
food
for
the
week
this
provided
that
soup
with
pieces
of
meat
was
to
be
given
on
the
day
of
my
visit
but
on
visiting
the
camp
kitchen
i
found
that
the
contractor
was
serving
fish
instead
of
meat
some
of
the
camp
commanders
not
only
treated
their
prisoners
kindly
but
introduced
manufactures
of
furniture
to
help
the
prisoners
to
pass
their
time
the
camps
of
krossen
and
göttingen
deserve
special
mention
at
giessen
the
camp
commander
had
permitted
the
erection
of
a
barrack
in
which
certain
prisoners
who
were
electrical
experts
gave
lessons
in
electrical
fitting
to
their
fellow
prisoners
there
was
also
a
studio
in
this
camp
where
prisoners
with
artistic
talent
were
furnished
with
paints
and
allowed
to
work
as
more
and
more
people
were
called
to
the
front
in
germany
greater
use
was
made
of
the
prisoners
and
in
the
summer
of
practically
all
the
prisoners
were
compelled
to
work
outside
of
the
camps
they
were
paid
a
small
extra
sum
for
this
a
few
cents
a
day
and
as
a
rule
were
benefited
by
the
change
of
scene
and
occupation
the
russians
especially
became
very
useful
to
the
germans
as
agricultural
laborers
professor
alonzo
taylor
of
the
university
of
pennsylvania
a
food
expert
and
mccarthy
also
of
philadelphia
joined
my
staff
in
and
proved
most
efficient
and
fearless
inspectors
of
prison
camps
taylor
could
use
the
terms
calories
proteins
as
readily
as
german
experts
and
at
a
greater
rate
of
speed
his
report
showing
that
the
official
diet
of
the
prisoners
in
ruhleben
was
a
starvation
diet
incensed
the
german
authorities
to
such
fury
that
they
forbade
him
to
revisit
ruhleben
professor
buckhaus
the
german
expert
agreed
with
him
in
some
of
his
findings
i
do
not
know
what
will
happen
to
the
professor
who
seemed
willing
to
do
his
best
for
the
prisoners
he
wrote
a
booklet
on
the
prison
camps
which
he
asked
permission
to
dedicate
to
me
but
the
war
office
which
published
the
book
refused
to
allow
him
to
make
this
dedication
it
was
a
real
pleasure
to
see
the
way
in
which
taylor
carried
on
his
work
of
food
inspection
and
his
work
as
well
as
that
of
the
other
doctors
sent
from
america
to
join
my
staff
drs
furbush
mccarthy

conditions
caldwell
the
sanitary
expert
known
for
his
great
work
in
serbia
now
i
believe
head
of
the
hospital
at
pittsburgh
reported
in
regard
to
the
prison
diet
while
of
good
quality
and
perhaps
sufficient
in
quantity
by
weight
it
is
lacking
in
the
essential
elements
which
contribute
to
the
making
of
a
and
satisfactory
diet
it
is
lacking
particularly
in
fat
and
protein
content
which
is
especially
desirable
during
the
colder
months
of
the
year
there
is
considerable
doubt
whether
this
diet
alone
without
being
supplemented
by
the
articles
of
food
received
by
the
prisoners
from
their
homes
would
in
any
way
be
sufficient
to
maintain
the
prisoners
in
health
and
strength
caldwell
also
visited
wittenberg
and
found
the
commander
by
temperament
and
so
on
unfitted
for
such
a
position
the
germans
as
taylor
has
pointed
out
tried
to
feed
prisoners
on
schedule
like
horses
there
is
however
a
nervous
discrimination
in
eating
so
far
as
man
is
concerned
and
a
diet
scientifically
fitted
to
keep
him
alive
may
fail
because
of
its
mere
monotony
think
of
living
as
the
prisoners
of
war
in
germany
have
for
years
without
ever
having
anything
except
black
bread
which
can
not
be
eaten
with
a
spoon
officer
prisoners
were
after
matters
had
settled
down
and
after
several
bitter
contests
which
i
had
with
the
german
authorities
fairly
well
treated
there
was
as
in
the
case
of
the
camps
for
the
privates
a
great
difference
between
camps
and
a
great
difference
between
camp
commanders
jackson
did
most
of
the
visiting
of
the
officers
camps
in
many
camps
the
officers
were
allowed
a
tennis
court
and
other
amusements
as
well
as
light
wine
or
beer
at
meals
but
the
length
of
the
war
had
a
bad
effect
on
the
mental
condition
of
many
of
the
officers
a
great
step
forward
was
made
when
arrangements
were
entered
into
between
germany
and
great
britain
whereby
wounded
and
sick
officers
and
men
when
passed
by
the
swiss
commission
which
visited
both
countries
were
sent
to
switzerland
sent
still
as
prisoners
of
war
subject
to
return
to
germany
or
england
respectively
but
the
opportunity
afforded
by
change
of
food
and
scene
as
well
as
reunion
of
families
saved
many
a
life
by
arrangements
between
the
two
countries
also
the
severely
wounded
prisoners
were
set
free
i
believe
that
this
exchange
of
the
heavily
wounded
between
the
germans
and
the
russians
was
the
factor
which
prevented
the
entrance
of
sweden
into
the
war
these
wounded
men
traversed
the
whole
length
of
sweden
in
the
railway
and
the
spectacle
afforded
to
the
swedish
population
of
these
poor
stumps
of
humanity
victims
of
war
has
quite
effectually
kept
the
swedish
population
from
an
attack
of
unnecessary
war
fever
officers
and
men
who
tried
to
escape
were
not
very
severely
punished
in
germany
unless
they
had
broken
or
stolen
something
in
their
attempt
officers
were
usually
subjected
to
a
jail
confinement
for
a
period
and
then
often
sent
to
a
sort
of
punitive
camp
such
a
camp
was
situated
in
one
of
the
ring
forts
surrounding
the
city
of
kustrin
which
i
visited
in
september
there
the
officers
had
no
opportunity
for
exercise
except
in
a
very
small
courtyard
or
on
the
roof
which
was
covered
with
grass
of
the
building
in
which
they
were
confined
i
arranged
however
on
my
visit
for
the
construction
of
a
tennis
court
outside
the
british
officers
in
germany
practically
subsisted
on
their
parcels
received
from
home
and
during
the
end
of
my
stay
a
much
better
tea
could
be
had
with
the
prison
officers
than
with
the
camp
commander
the
prisoners
had
real
tea
and
marmalade
and
white
bread
to
offer
luxuries
which
had
long
since
disappeared
from
all
german
tables
on
the
whole
the
quarters
given
to
the
prisons
in
germany
were
not
satisfactory
and
were
not
of
the
kind
that
should
have
been
offered
to
officer
prisoners
of
war
at
the
time
i
left
germany
there
were
nearly
two
million
prisoners
of
war
in
the
empire
of
whom
about
ten
thousand
were
russian
officers
nine
thousand
french
officers
and
about
one
thousand
british
officers
as
a
rule
our
inspectors
found
the
hospitals
where
the
prisoners
of
war
were
in
as
good
condition
as
could
be
expected
i
think
this
was
largely
due
to
the
fact
that
so
many
doctors
in
germany
are
jews
the
people
who
are
of
the
jewish
race
are
people
of
gentle
instincts
in
these
hospitals
a
better
diet
was
given
to
the
prisoners
there
were
of
course
in
addition
to
the
regular
hospitals
hospitals
where
the
severely
wounded
prisoners
were
sent
almost
uniformly
these
hospitals
were
clean
and
the
prisoners
were
well
taken
care
of
illustration
in
ruhleben
camp
a
specimen
both
of
the
work
and
of
the
types
about
him
at
ruhleben
there
was
a
hospital
which
in
spite
of
many
representations
was
never
in
proper
shape
in
addition
there
was
in
the
camp
a
special
barrack
established
by
the
prisoners
themselves
for
the
care
of
those
who
were
so
ill
or
so
weak
as
to
require
special
attention
but
who
were
not
ill
enough
to
be
sent
to
the
hospital
this
barrack
was
for
a
long
time
in
charge
of
a
devoted
gentleman
a
prisoner
whose
name
i
have
unfortunately
forgotten
but
whose
deserves
special
mention
i
arranged
with
the
camp
authorities
and
the
german
authorities
for
permission
to
enter
into
a
contract
with
weiler
under
this
contract
weiler
who
had
a
sanatorium
in
the
west
of
berlin
received
patients
from
ruhleben
those
who
were
able
paid
for
themselves
the
poorer
ones
being
paid
for
by
the
british
government
this
sanatorium
occupied
several
villas
i
had
many
disputes
with
weiler
but
finally
managed
to
get
this
sanatorium
in
such
condition
that
the
prisoners
who
resided
there
were
fairly
well
taken
care
of
an
arrangement
was
made
between
great
britain
and
germany
by
which
civilians
unfit
for
military
service
were
sent
to
their
respective
countries
and
just
before
i
left
i
effected
an
arrangement
by
which
all
civilians
over
years
old
with
the
exception
of
twenty
who
might
be
held
by
each
country
for
military
reasons
were
to
be
released
i
do
not
know
whether
this
arrangement
was
actually
carried
out
in
full
with
the
lapse
of
time
the
mental
condition
of
the
older
prisoners
in
ruhleben
had
become
quite
alarming
soldier
prisoners
when
they
enter
the
army
are
always
in
good
physical
condition
and
enter
with
the
expectation
of
either
being
killed
or
wounded
or
taken
prisoner
and
have
made
their
arrangements
accordingly
but
these
unfortunate
civilian
prisoners
were
often
men
in
delicate
health
and
all
were
in
a
constant
state
of
great
mental
anxiety
as
to
the
fate
of
their
business
and
their
enterprises
and
their
families
in
not
only
grafton
minot
who
for
some
time
had
devoted
himself
exclusively
to
the
ruhleben
prisoners
but
also
ellis
dresel
a
distinguished
lawyer
of
boston
who
had
joined
the
embassy
as
a
volunteer
took
up
the
work
dresel
visited
ruhleben
almost
daily
and
by
listening
to
the
stories
and
complaints
of
the
prisoners
materially
helped
their
mental
condition
the
germans
collected
all
the
soldier
prisoners
of
irish
nationality
in
one
camp
at
limburg
not
far
from
frankfurt
these
efforts
were
made
to
induce
them
to
join
the
german
army
the
men
were
well
treated
and
were
often
visited
by
sir
roger
casement
who
working
with
the
german
authorities
tried
to
get
these
irishmen
to
desert
their
flag
and
join
the
germans
a
few
weaklings
were
persuaded
by
sir
roger
who
finally
discontinued
his
visits
after
obtaining
about
thirty
recruits
because
the
remaining
irishmen
chased
him
out
of
the
camp
i
received
information
of
the
shooting
of
one
prisoner
and
although
the
camp
authorities
had
told
mccarthy
that
the
investigation
had
been
closed
and
the
guard
who
did
the
shooting
exonerated
nevertheless
when
i
visited
the
camp
in
order
to
investigate
i
was
told
that
i
could
not
do
so
because
the
matter
of
the
shooting
was
still
under
investigation
nor
was
i
allowed
to
speak
to
those
prisoners
who
had
been
witnesses
at
the
time
of
the
shooting
i
afterwards
learned
that
another
irishman
had
been
shot
by
a
guard
on
the
day
before
my
visit
and
the
same
obstacles
to
my
investigation
were
drawn
about
this
case
the
irishmen
did
not
bear
confinement
well
and
at
the
time
of
my
visit
among
them
many
of
them
were
suffering
from
tuberculosis
in
the
camp
hospital
they
seemed
also
peculiarly
subject
to
mental
breakdowns
two
devoted
catholic
priests
father
crotty
and
a
brother
warren
from
a
religious
house
in
belgium
were
doing
wonderful
work
among
these
prisoners
the
sending
out
of
the
prisoners
of
war
to
work
throughout
germany
has
had
one
very
evil
effect
it
has
made
it
to
the
financial
advantage
of
certain
farmers
and
manufacturers
to
have
the
war
continued
the
prussian
land
owners
or
junkers
obtain
four
or
five
times
as
much
for
their
agricultural
products
as
they
did
before
the
war
and
have
the
work
on
their
farms
performed
by
prisoners
of
war
to
whom
they
are
required
to
pay
only
six
cents
a
day
when
the
called
attention
to
this
it
was
suppressed
for
several
days
at
many
of
these
working
camps
our
inspectors
were
refused
admission
on
the
ground
that
they
might
learn
trade
or
war
secrets
they
succeeded
however
in
having
the
men
sent
outside
in
order
that
they
might
inspect
them
and
hear
their
complaints
there
were
in
germany
about
one
hundred
central
camps
and
perhaps
ten
thousand
or
more
working
camps
in
summer
time
throughout
the
country
some
of
the
british
prisoners
were
put
to
work
on
the
sewage
farm
of
berlin
but
we
succeeded
in
getting
them
sent
back
to
their
parent
camp
the
prisoners
of
war
were
often
accused
of
various
breaches
of
discipline
and
crimes
members
of
the
embassy
would
attend
these
trials
and
we
endeavoured
to
see
that
the
prisoners
were
properly
represented
but
the
germans
often
refused
us
an
opportunity
to
see
the
prisoners
before
their
trial
or
even
before
their
execution
the
case
of
captain
fryatt
is
in
point
captain
fryatt
who
commanded
a
british
merchant
ship
was
captured
and
taken
to
the
civilian
camp
at
ruhleben
in
searching
him
the
germans
claimed
that
he
wore
a
watch
presented
to
him
for
an
attempt
to
ram
a
german
submarine
they
therefore
took
fryatt
from
the
ruhleben
camp
and
sent
him
to
bruges
for
trial
when
i
heard
of
this
i
immediately
sent
two
formal
notes
to
the
german
foreign
office
demanding
the
right
to
see
fryatt
and
hire
counsel
to
represent
him
inquiring
what
sort
of
counsel
would
be
permitted
to
attend
the
trial
and
asking
for
postponement
of
the
trial
until
these
matters
could
be
arranged
the
german
foreign
office
had
informed
me
that
they
had
backed
up
these
requests
and
i
believe
them
but
the
answer
of
the
german
admiralty
to
my
notes
was
to
cause
the
trial
to
proceed
the
morning
after
the
day
on
which
my
notes
were
delivered
and
to
shoot
fryatt
before
noon
of
the
same
day
as
to
the
evidence
regarding
the
watch
the
british
foreign
office
learned
that
when
captured
captain
fryatt
had
neither
a
watch
nor
any
letter
to
indicate
that
he
had
tried
to
ram
a
submarine
this
cruel
and
outrage
caused
great
indignation
in
england
and
even
in
certain
circles
in
germany
and
the
manner
in
which
my
request
was
treated
was
certainly
a
direct
insult
to
the
country
which
i
represented
in
conversation
with
me
zimmermann
and
the
chancellor
and
von
jagow
all
expressed
the
greatest
regret
over
this
incident
which
shows
how
little
control
the
civilian
branch
of
the
government
has
over
the
military
in
time
of
war
later
on
when
similar
charges
were
made
against
another
british
sea
captain
the
foreign
office
i
think
through
the
influence
of
the
emperor
was
able
to
prevent
a
recurrence
of
the
fryatt
outrage
as
i
have
said
many
of
the
camp
commanders
in
germany
were
men
excellent
and
efficient
and
kind
hearted
who
did
what
they
could
for
the
prisoners
it
is
a
pity
that
these
men
should
bear
the
odium
which
attaches
to
germany
because
of
the
general
bad
treatment
of
prisoners
of
war
in
the
first
days
of
the
war
and
because
certain
commanders
of
prison
camps
were
not
fitted
for
their
positions
the
commander
at
the
camp
at
wittenberg
was
replaced
but
the
germans
have
never
acknowledged
that
bad
conditions
had
existed
in
that
camp
shortly
before
we
left
germany
the
war
department
seemed
to
gain
more
control
of
the
prisoners
of
war
situation
and
on
our
representations
at
least
one
camp
commander
was
permanently
relieved
if
examples
had
been
made
early
in
the
war
of
the
camp
commanders
who
were
not
fit
for
their
places
and
of
those
who
had
in
any
way
mishandled
prisoners
of
war
the
german
people
as
a
whole
would
not
have
had
to
bear
the
burden
of
this
odium
the
many
prisoners
will
return
to
their
homes
with
a
deep
and
bitter
hatred
of
all
things
german
the
british
government
took
a
great
interest
in
the
british
prisoners
in
germany
nothing
was
omitted
and
every
suggestion
made
by
me
was
immediately
acted
on
while
many
most
valuable
hints
were
given
me
from
london
as
to
prisoners
affairs
their
majesties
the
king
and
queen
showed
a
deep
personal
concern
in
the
welfare
of
the
unfortunate
british
in
german
hands
and
this
concern
never
flagged
during
the
period
of
my
stay
in
berlin
lord
robert
cecil
and
lord
newton
were
continually
working
for
the
benefit
of
british
prisoners
at
a
time
when
the
british
prisoners
were
without
proper
clothing
the
british
government
sent
me
uniforms
overcoats
and
i
hired
a
warehouse
in
berlin
as
a
distributing
point
but
after
some
months
the
german
authorities
refused
to
allow
me
to
continue
this
method
of
distribution
on
the
ground
that
it
was
the
duty
of
germany
to
provide
the
prisoners
with
clothes
but
germany
was
not
performing
this
duty
and
the
british
prisoners
had
to
suffer
because
of
this
german
official
woodenheadedness
in
the
spring
of
quite
characteristically
the
germans
broke
their
treaty
concerning
visits
to
prisoners
and
refused
to
permit
us
to
speak
to
prisoners
out
of
hearing
von
jagow
told
me
that
this
was
because
of
the
trouble
made
among
russian
prisoners
by
the
visits
of
madam
sazonoff
but
this
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
arrangement
between
great
britain
and
germany
i
think
that
the
germans
suspected
that
i
had
learned
from
fellow
prisoners
of
the
cruel
and
unnecessary
shooting
of
two
irish
prisoners
at
limburg
it
was
not
from
prisoners
however
that
i
obtained
this
information
but
from
germans
who
wrote
to
me
in
addition
to
the
english
and
japanese
i
had
the
protection
of
the
serbian
and
roumanian
subjects
and
the
protection
of
the
interests
of
a
very
small
country
the
republic
of
san
marino
soon
after
the
serbians
and
roumanians
appeared
in
the
prison
camps
of
germany
we
made
reports
on
the
condition
and
treatment
of
these
prisoners
as
well
as
reports
concerning
the
british
i
was
able
to
converse
with
some
serbians
in
the
first
days
of
the
war
in
their
native
tongue
which
curiously
enough
was
spanish
immediately
after
the
persecution
of
the
jews
in
spain
by
ferdinand
and
isabella
and
other
monarchs
a
number
of
spanish
jews
emigrated
to
serbia
where
they
have
remained
ever
since
keeping
their
old
customs
and
speaking
the
old
spanish
of
the
time
of
cervantes
the
german
authorities
in
the
most
petty
manner
often
concealed
from
me
the
presence
of
british
prisoners
especially
civilians
in
prison
camps
for
a
long
time
i
was
not
informed
of
the
presence
of
british
civilians
in
sennelager
and
it
was
only
by
paying
a
surprise
visit
by
motor
to
the
camp
at
brandenburg
that
i
discovered
a
few
british
the
crew
of
a
trawler
there
it
was
on
information
contained
in
an
anonymous
letter
evidently
from
the
wife
of
some
german
officer
that
i
visited
brandenburg
where
the
crew
of
this
trawler
deprived
of
money
were
without
any
of
the
little
comforts
or
packages
that
mitigate
life
in
a
german
prison
camp
chapter
xi
first
days
of
the
war
political
and
diplomatic
at
the
commencement
of
the
war
for
some
days
i
was
cut
off
from
communication
with
the
united
states
but
we
soon
established
a
chain
of
communication
at
first
through
italy
and
later
by
way
of
denmark
at
all
times
cables
from
washington
to
berlin
or
took
on
the
average
two
days
in
transmission
after
the
fall
of
liège
von
jagow
sent
for
me
and
asked
me
if
i
would
transmit
through
the
american
legation
a
proposition
offering
belgium
peace
and
indemnity
if
no
further
opposition
were
made
to
the
passage
of
german
troops
through
belgium
as
the
proposition
was
a
proposition
for
peace
i
took
the
responsibility
of
forwarding
it
and
sent
the
note
of
the
german
government
to
our
minister
at
the
hague
for
transmission
to
our
minister
in
belgium
van
dyke
our
minister
at
the
hague
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
transmission
of
this
proposition
and
turned
the
german
note
over
to
the
holland
minister
for
foreign
affairs
and
through
this
channel
the
proposition
reached
the
belgian
government
the
state
department
cabled
me
a
message
from
the
president
to
the
emperor
which
stated
that
the
united
states
stood
ready
at
any
time
to
mediate
between
the
warring
powers
and
directed
me
to
present
this
proposition
direct
to
the
emperor
i
therefore
asked
for
an
audience
with
the
emperor
and
received
word
from
the
chief
court
marshal
that
the
emperor
would
receive
me
at
the
palace
in
berlin
on
the
morning
of
august
tenth
i
drove
in
a
motor
into
the
courtyard
of
the
palace
and
was
there
escorted
to
the
door
which
opened
on
a
flight
of
steps
leading
to
a
little
garden
about
fifty
yards
square
directly
on
the
embankment
of
the
river
spree
which
flows
past
the
royal
palace
as
i
went
down
the
steps
the
empress
and
her
only
daughter
the
duchess
of
brunswick
came
up
both
stopped
and
shook
hands
with
me
speaking
a
few
words
i
found
the
emperor
seated
at
a
green
iron
table
under
a
large
canvas
garden
umbrella
telegraph
forms
were
scattered
on
the
table
in
front
of
him
and
basking
in
the
gravel
were
two
small
dachshunds
i
explained
to
the
emperor
the
object
of
my
visit
and
we
had
a
general
conversation
about
the
war
and
the
state
of
affairs
the
emperor
took
some
of
the
large
telegraph
blanks
and
wrote
out
in
pencil
his
reply
to
the
president
offer
this
reply
of
course
i
cabled
immediately
to
the
state
department
the
president
of
states
personally
prince
henry
was
received
by
his
majesty
king
george
v
in
london
who
empowered
him
to
transmit
to
me
verbally
that
england
would
remain
neutral
if
war
broke
out
on
the
continent
involving
germany
and
france
austria
and
russia
this
message
was
telegraphed
to
me
by
my
brother
from
london
after
his
conversation
with
the
king
and
repeated
verbally
on
the
of
july
my
ambassador
in
london
transmitted
a
message
from
sir
grey
to
berlin
saying
that
only
in
case
france
was
likely
to
be
crushed
england
would
interfere
on
the
thirtieth
my
ambassador
in
london
reported
that
sir
edward
grey
in
course
of
a
private
conversation
told
him
that
if
the
conflict
remained
localized
between
not
serbia
and
england
would
not
move
but
if
we
mixed
in
the
fray
she
would
take
quick
decisions
and
grave
measures
if
i
left
my
ally
austria
in
the
lurch
to
fight
alone
england
would
not
touch
me
this
communication
being
directly
counter
to
the
message
to
me
i
telegraphed
to
on
the
or
thirtieth
thanking
him
for
kind
messages
through
my
brother
and
begging
him
to
use
all
his
power
to
keep
france
and
russia
his
allies
from
making
any
preparations
calculated
to
disturb
my
work
of
mediation
stating
that
i
was
in
constant
communication
with
the
czar
in
the
evening
the
king
kindly
answered
that
he
had
ordered
his
government
to
use
every
possible
influence
with
his
allies
to
refrain
from
taking
any
provocative
military
measures
at
the
same
time
asked
me
if
i
would
transmit
to
vienna
the
british
proposal
that
austria
was
to
take
belgrade
and
a
few
other
serbian
towns
and
a
strip
of
country
as
a
to
make
sure
that
the
serbian
promises
on
paper
should
be
fulfilled
in
reality
this
proposal
was
in
the
same
moment
telegraphed
to
me
from
vienna
for
london
quite
in
conjunction
with
the
british
proposal
besides
i
had
telegraphed
to
the
czar
the
same
as
an
idea
of
mine
before
i
received
the
two
communications
from
vienna
and
london
as
both
were
of
the
same
opinion
i
immediately
transmitted
the
telegrams
to
vienna
and
london
i
felt
that
i
was
able
to
tide
the
question
over
and
was
happy
at
the
peaceful
outlook
while
i
was
preparing
a
note
to
the
czar
the
next
morning
to
inform
him
that
vienna
london
and
berlin
were
agreed
about
the
treatment
of
affairs
i
received
the
telephones
from
the
chancellor
that
in
the
night
before
the
czar
had
given
the
order
to
mobilize
the
whole
of
the
russian
army
which
was
of
course
also
meant
against
germany
whereas
up
till
then
the
southern
armies
had
been
mobilized
against
austria
in
a
telegram
from
london
my
ambassador
informed
me
he
understood
the
british
government
would
guarantee
neutrality
of
france
and
wished
to
know
whether
germany
would
refrain
from
attack
i
telegraphed
to
the
king
personally
that
mobilization
being
already
carried
out
could
not
be
stopped
but
if
could
guarantee
with
his
armed
forces
the
neutrality
of
france
i
would
refrain
attacking
her
and
employ
my
troops
elsewhere
answered
that
he
thought
my
offer
was
based
on
a
misunderstanding
and
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
sir
grey
never
took
my
offer
into
serious
consideration
he
never
answered
it
instead
he
declared
england
had
to
defend
belgian
neutrality
which
had
to
be
violated
by
germany
on
strategical
grounds
news
having
been
received
that
france
was
already
preparing
to
enter
belgium
and
the
king
of
belgians
having
refused
my
petition
for
a
free
passage
under
guarantee
of
his
country
freedom
i
am
most
grateful
for
the
message
william
when
the
german
emperor
in
my
presence
indited
his
letter
to
president
wilson
of
august
tenth
he
asked
that
i
cable
it
immediately
to
the
state
department
and
that
i
simultaneously
give
it
to
the
press
as
i
have
already
stated
i
cabled
the
document
immediately
to
the
state
department
at
washington
but
i
withheld
it
from
publication
my
interview
with
the
emperor
was
in
the
morning
that
afternoon
a
man
holding
a
high
position
in
germany
sent
for
me
i
do
not
give
his
name
because
i
do
not
wish
to
involve
him
in
any
way
with
the
emperor
so
i
shall
not
even
indicate
whether
he
is
a
royalty
or
an
official
he
said
you
had
an
interview
today
with
the
emperor
what
happened
i
told
of
the
message
given
me
for
the
president
which
was
intended
for
publication
by
the
emperor
he
said
i
think
you
ought
to
show
that
message
to
me
you
know
the
emperor
is
a
constitutional
emperor
and
there
was
once
a
great
row
about
such
a
message
i
showed
him
the
message
and
when
he
had
read
it
he
said
i
think
it
would
be
inadvisable
for
us
to
have
this
message
published
and
in
the
interest
of
good
feeling
between
germany
and
america
if
you
cable
it
ask
that
publication
be
withheld
i
complied
with
his
request
and
it
is
characteristic
of
the
president
desire
to
preserve
good
relations
that
publication
was
withheld
now
when
the
two
countries
are
at
war
when
the
whole
world
and
especially
our
own
country
has
an
interest
in
knowing
how
this
great
calamity
of
universal
war
came
to
the
earth
the
time
has
come
when
this
message
should
be
given
out
and
i
have
published
it
by
permission
this
most
interesting
document
in
the
first
place
clears
up
one
issue
never
really
obscure
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
the
deliberate
violation
of
the
neutrality
of
belgium
whose
territory
had
to
be
violated
by
germany
on
strategical
grounds
the
very
weak
excuse
is
added
that
news
had
been
received
that
france
was
already
preparing
to
enter
belgium
not
even
a
pretense
that
there
had
ever
been
any
actual
violation
of
belgium
frontier
by
the
french
prior
to
the
german
invasion
of
that
unfortunate
country
of
course
the
second
excuse
that
the
king
of
the
belgians
had
refused
entrance
to
the
emperor
troops
under
guarantee
of
his
country
freedom
is
even
weaker
than
the
first
it
would
indeed
inaugurate
a
new
era
in
the
intercourse
of
nations
if
a
small
nation
could
only
preserve
its
freedom
by
at
all
times
on
request
granting
free
passage
to
the
troops
of
a
powerful
neighbour
on
the
march
to
attack
an
adjoining
country
and
aside
from
the
violation
of
belgian
neutrality
what
would
have
become
of
england
and
of
the
world
if
the
prussian
autocracy
had
been
left
free
to
defeat
one
by
one
the
nations
of
the
earth
first
the
defeat
of
russia
and
serbia
by
austria
and
germany
the
incorporation
of
a
large
part
of
russia
in
the
german
empire
german
influence
predominant
in
russia
and
all
the
vast
resources
of
that
great
empire
at
the
command
of
germany
all
the
fleets
in
the
world
could
uselessly
blockade
the
german
coasts
if
germany
possessed
the
limitless
riches
of
the
empire
of
the
romanoffs
illustration
alleged
bullets
which
the
germans
declared
had
been
found
in
longwy
the
german
army
drawing
for
reserves
on
the
teeming
populations
of
russia
and
siberia
would
never
know
defeat
and
this
is
not
idle
conjecture
mere
dreaming
in
the
realm
of
possibilities
because
the
russian
revolution
has
shown
us
how
weak
and
tottering
in
reality
was
the
dreaded
power
of
the
czar
russia
beaten
and
half
digested
france
would
have
been
an
easy
prey
and
england
even
if
then
joining
france
in
war
would
have
a
far
different
problem
to
face
if
the
were
now
sailing
from
cherbourg
and
calais
and
brest
and
bordeaux
on
the
mission
of
piracy
and
murder
and
then
would
come
our
turn
and
that
of
latin
america
the
first
attack
would
come
not
on
us
but
on
south
or
central
america
at
some
point
to
which
it
would
be
as
difficult
for
us
to
send
troops
to
help
our
neighbor
as
it
would
be
for
germany
to
attack
remember
that
in
southern
brazil
nearly
four
hundred
thousand
germans
are
sustained
as
i
found
out
in
their
devotion
to
the
fatherland
by
annual
grants
of
money
for
educational
purposes
from
the
imperial
treasury
in
berlin
it
was
not
without
reason
that
at
this
interview
when
the
kaiser
wrote
this
message
to
the
president
he
said
that
the
coming
in
of
england
had
changed
the
whole
situation
and
would
make
the
war
a
long
one
the
kaiser
talked
rather
despondently
about
the
war
i
tried
to
cheer
him
up
by
saying
the
german
troops
would
soon
enter
paris
but
he
answered
the
english
change
the
whole
situation
an
obstinate
nation
they
will
keep
up
the
war
it
can
not
end
soon
it
was
the
entry
of
england
into
the
war
in
defence
of
the
rights
of
small
nations
in
defence
of
the
guaranteed
neutrality
of
belgium
which
saved
the
world
from
the
harsh
dominion
of
the
prussians
and
therefore
saved
as
well
the
two
americas
and
their
protecting
doctrine
of
president
monroe
the
document
which
is
dated
august
tenth
supersedes
the
statement
made
by
the
german
chancellor
von
in
his
speech
before
the
reichstag
on
august
fourth
in
which
he
gave
the
then
official
account
of
the
entrance
into
the
war
of
the
central
empires
it
will
be
noted
that
von
insisted
that
france
began
the
war
in
the
sentence
reading
there
were
fliers
cavalry
patrols
invading
companies
in
the
reichsland
thereby
france
although
the
condition
of
war
had
not
yet
been
declared
had
attacked
our
territory
but
the
emperor
makes
no
mention
of
this
fact
of
supreme
importance
if
true
in
his
writing
to
president
wilson
six
days
later
quite
curiously
at
this
time
there
was
a
belief
on
the
part
of
the
germans
that
japan
would
declare
war
on
the
allies
and
range
herself
on
the
side
of
the
central
powers
in
fact
on
one
night
there
was
a
friendly
demonstration
in
front
of
the
japanese
embassy
but
these
hopes
were
soon
dispelled
by
the
ultimatum
of
japan
sent
on
the
sixteenth
of
august
and
finally
by
the
declaration
of
war
on
august
during
the
first
days
of
the
war
the
warring
powers
indulged
in
mutual
recriminations
as
to
the
use
of
dumdum
bullets
and
i
was
given
several
packages
of
cartridges
containing
bullets
bored
out
at
the
top
which
the
germans
said
had
been
found
in
the
french
fortress
of
longwy
with
a
request
that
i
send
an
account
of
them
to
president
wilson
and
ask
for
his
intervention
in
the
matter
very
wisely
president
wilson
refused
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
as
otherwise
he
would
have
been
deluged
with
constant
complaints
from
both
sides
as
to
the
violations
of
the
rules
of
war
the
cartridges
given
to
me
were
in
packages
marked
on
the
outside
de
and
from
this
i
took
it
that
possibly
these
cartridges
had
been
used
on
some
shooting
range
near
the
fort
and
the
bullets
bored
out
in
order
that
they
might
not
go
too
far
if
carelessly
fired
over
the
targets
on
august
fifth
with
our
naval
attaché
commander
walter
gherardi
i
called
upon
von
tirpitz
to
learn
from
him
which
ports
be
considered
safest
for
the
ships
to
be
sent
from
america
with
gold
for
stranded
americans
he
recommended
rotterdam
i
also
had
a
conversation
on
this
day
with
geheimrat
letze
of
the
foreign
office
with
reference
to
the
proposition
that
english
and
german
ships
respectively
should
have
a
delay
of
until
the
fourteenth
of
august
in
which
to
leave
the
english
or
german
ports
in
which
they
chanced
to
be
the
second
week
in
august
my
wife
sister
and
her
husband
count
sigray
arrived
in
berlin
count
sigray
is
a
reserve
officer
of
the
hungarian
hussars
and
was
in
montana
when
the
first
rumours
of
war
came
he
and
his
wife
immediately
started
for
new
york
and
sailed
on
the
fourth
of
august
they
landed
in
england
and
as
england
had
not
yet
declared
war
on
austria
they
were
able
to
proceed
on
their
journey
with
them
were
count
george
festetics
and
count
cziraki
the
former
from
the
austrian
embassy
in
london
and
the
latter
from
that
in
washington
they
were
all
naturally
very
much
excited
about
war
and
the
events
of
their
trip
the
hungarians
as
a
people
are
quite
like
americans
they
have
agreeable
manners
and
are
able
to
laugh
in
a
natural
way
something
which
seems
to
be
a
lost
art
in
prussia
nearly
all
the
members
of
hungarian
noble
families
speak
english
perfectly
and
model
their
clothes
sports
and
country
life
as
far
as
possible
after
the
english
the
thirteenth
saw
the
departure
of
our
first
special
train
containing
americans
bound
for
holland
i
saw
the
americans
off
at
the
charlottenburg
station
they
all
departed
in
great
spirits
and
very
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
leave
germany
i
had
some
negotiations
about
the
purchase
by
america
or
americans
of
the
ships
of
the
north
german
lloyd
but
nothing
came
of
these
negotiations
trainloads
of
americans
continued
to
leave
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
to
the
americans
coming
into
berlin
from
all
directions
on
august
count
szoegyeny
the
austrian
ambassador
left
berlin
he
had
been
ambassador
there
for
years
and
i
suppose
because
of
his
advancing
years
the
austrian
government
thought
that
he
had
outlived
his
usefulness
quite
a
crowd
of
germans
and
diplomats
were
at
the
station
to
witness
the
rather
sad
farewell
his
successor
was
prince
hohenlohe
married
to
a
daughter
of
archduke
frederick
she
expressly
waived
her
right
to
precedence
as
a
royal
highness
and
agreed
to
take
only
the
precedence
given
to
her
as
the
wife
of
the
ambassador
in
order
not
to
cause
feeling
in
berlin
prince
hohenlohe
a
rather
man
who
had
been
most
popular
in
russia
and
austria
immediately
made
a
favourable
impression
in
berlin
and
successfully
occupied
the
difficult
position
of
mediator
between
the
governments
of
berlin
and
vienna
on
september
fourth
the
chancellor
gave
me
a
statement
to
give
to
the
reporters
in
which
he
attacked
england
claiming
that
england
did
not
desire
the
friendship
of
germany
but
was
moved
by
commercial
jealousy
and
a
desire
to
crush
her
that
the
efforts
made
for
peace
had
failed
because
russia
under
all
circumstances
was
resolved
upon
war
and
that
germany
had
entered
belgium
in
order
to
forestall
the
planned
french
advance
he
also
claimed
that
england
regardless
of
consequences
to
the
white
race
had
excited
japan
to
a
pillaging
expedition
and
claimed
that
belgian
girls
and
women
had
gouged
out
the
eyes
of
the
wounded
that
officers
had
been
invited
to
dinner
and
shot
across
the
table
and
belgian
women
had
cut
the
throats
of
soldiers
quartered
in
their
houses
while
they
were
asleep
the
chancellor
concluded
by
saying
in
this
statement
that
everyone
knows
that
the
german
people
is
not
capable
of
unnecessary
cruelty
or
of
any
brutality
we
were
fully
occupied
with
taking
care
of
the
english
prisoners
and
interests
the
americans
and
negotiations
relating
to
commercial
questions
and
to
getting
goods
required
in
the
united
states
out
of
germany
when
on
october
seventh
a
most
unpleasant
incident
and
one
which
for
some
time
caused
the
members
of
our
embassy
to
feel
rather
bitterly
toward
the
german
foreign
office
took
place
a
great
number
of
british
civilians
men
and
women
were
stranded
in
berlin
to
many
of
these
were
paid
sums
of
money
in
the
form
of
small
allowances
on
behalf
of
the
british
government
in
order
to
facilitate
this
work
we
placed
the
clerks
employed
in
this
distribution
in
the
building
formerly
occupied
by
the
british
consul
in
berlin
of
course
the
great
crowds
of
americans
resorting
to
our
embassy
when
combined
with
the
crowds
of
british
made
it
almost
impossible
even
to
enter
the
embassy
and
establishment
of
this
outlying
relief
station
materially
helped
this
situation
i
occupied
it
and
employed
english
men
and
english
women
in
this
relief
work
by
the
express
permission
of
the
imperial
foreign
office
which
i
thought
it
wise
to
obtain
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
germans
seemed
daily
to
become
more
irritable
and
suspicious
especially
after
the
battle
of
the
marne
on
the
night
of
october
second
our
second
secretary
harvey
went
to
this
relief
headquarters
at
about
twelve
at
night
and
was
witness
to
a
raid
made
by
the
berlin
police
on
this
establishment
of
ours
the
men
and
women
working
were
arrested
and
all
books
and
papers
which
the
police
could
get
at
were
seized
by
them
the
next
morning
i
went
around
to
the
place
and
on
talking
with
the
criminal
detectives
in
charge
was
told
by
them
that
they
had
made
the
raid
by
the
orders
of
the
foreign
office
when
i
spoke
to
the
foreign
office
about
this
they
denied
that
they
had
given
directions
for
the
raid
and
made
a
sort
of
half
apology
the
raid
was
all
the
more
unjustified
because
only
the
day
before
i
had
had
a
conversation
with
the
adjutant
of
the
berlin
kommandantur
and
told
him
that
although
i
had
permission
from
the
foreign
office
i
thought
it
would
be
better
to
dismiss
the
english
employed
and
employ
only
americans
or
germans
and
i
sent
round
to
my
friend
herr
von
gwinner
head
of
the
deutsche
bank
and
asked
him
to
recommend
some
german
accountants
to
me
the
kommandantur
is
the
direct
office
of
military
control
when
the
adjutant
heard
of
the
raid
he
was
almost
as
indignant
as
i
was
and
on
the
tenth
of
october
informed
me
that
he
had
learned
that
the
raid
had
been
made
on
the
joint
orders
of
the
foreign
office
and
von
tirpitz
department
the
books
and
papers
of
an
embassy
including
those
relating
to
the
affairs
of
foreign
nations
temporarily
in
the
care
are
universally
recognised
in
international
law
as
not
subject
to
seizure
nor
did
the
fact
that
i
was
carrying
on
this
work
outside
the
actual
embassy
building
have
any
bearing
on
this
point
so
long
as
the
building
was
directly
under
my
control
and
especially
as
the
only
work
carried
on
was
work
properly
in
my
hands
in
my
official
capacity
the
foreign
office
saw
that
they
had
made
a
mistake
but
at
zimmermann
earnest
request
i
agreed
as
it
were
to
forget
the
incident
later
on
this
precedent
might
have
been
used
by
our
government
had
they
desired
to
press
the
matter
of
the
seizure
of
von
igel
papers
von
igel
it
will
be
remembered
was
carrying
on
business
of
a
private
nature
in
a
private
office
hired
by
him
nevertheless
as
he
had
been
employed
in
some
capacity
in
the
german
embassy
at
washington
count
von
bernstorff
claimed
immunity
from
seizure
for
the
papers
found
in
that
office
on
august
sixteenth
the
kaiser
left
berlin
for
the
front
i
wrote
to
his
master
of
the
household
saying
that
i
should
like
an
opportunity
to
be
at
the
railway
station
to
say
to
the
emperor
but
was
put
off
on
various
excuses
thereafter
the
emperor
practically
abandoned
berlin
and
lived
either
in
silesia
at
pless
or
at
some
place
near
the
western
front
at
first
following
the
precedent
of
the
war
of
the
more
important
members
of
the
government
followed
the
kaiser
to
the
front
even
the
chancellor
and
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
abandoning
their
offices
in
berlin
not
long
afterwards
when
it
was
apparent
that
the
war
must
be
carried
on
on
several
fronts
and
that
it
was
not
going
to
be
the
matter
of
a
few
weeks
which
the
germans
had
first
supposed
these
officials
returned
to
their
offices
in
berlin
in
the
meantime
however
much
confusion
had
been
caused
by
this
rather
ridiculous
effort
to
follow
the
customs
of
the
war
of
when
von
jagow
minister
of
foreign
affairs
was
absent
at
the
great
general
headquarters
the
diplomats
remaining
behind
conducted
their
negotiations
with
zimmermann
who
in
turn
had
to
transmit
everything
to
the
great
general
headquarters
in
august
there
were
apparently
rumours
afloat
in
countries
outside
of
germany
that
prominent
socialists
at
the
outbreak
of
the
war
had
been
shot
the
state
department
cabled
me
to
find
out
whether
there
was
any
truth
in
these
rumours
with
particular
reference
to
liebknecht
and
rosa
luxemburg
liebknecht
is
a
lawyer
practicing
in
berlin
and
so
i
telephoned
him
asking
him
to
come
and
see
me
he
did
so
and
of
course
by
his
presence
verified
the
fact
that
he
had
not
been
executed
he
told
me
that
the
rumours
as
to
the
treatment
of
the
socialists
were
entirely
unfounded
and
said
that
he
had
no
objection
to
my
cabling
a
statement
that
the
socialists
were
opposed
to
czarismus
and
that
he
personally
had
confidence
in
the
german
army
and
the
cause
of
the
german
people
many
people
confuse
liebknecht
with
his
father
now
dead
liebknecht
the
son
is
a
man
of
perhaps
years
with
dark
bushy
hair
and
moustache
and
wearing
a
man
of
medium
height
and
not
at
all
of
strong
build
in
the
numerous
interruptions
made
by
him
during
the
debates
in
the
reichstag
during
the
first
year
of
the
war
his
voice
sounded
high
and
shrill
of
course
anyone
who
defies
the
heavy
hand
of
autocracy
must
suffer
from
nervousness
we
all
knew
that
sooner
or
later
autocracy
would
get
liebknecht
and
its
opportunity
came
when
he
appeared
in
citizen
clothes
at
an
attempted
at
the
potsdamerplatz
for
the
offence
of
appearing
out
of
uniform
after
being
called
and
mobilized
and
for
alleged
incitement
of
the
people
he
was
condemned
for
a
long
term
of
imprisonment
one
can
but
admire
his
courage
i
believe
that
he
earns
his
living
by
the
practice
of
law
before
one
of
the
minor
courts
it
is
hard
to
say
just
what
he
will
play
in
the
future
it
is
probable
that
when
the
socialists
settle
down
after
the
war
and
think
things
over
they
will
consider
that
the
leadership
of
scheidemann
has
been
too
conservative
that
he
submitted
too
readily
to
the
powers
of
autocracy
and
too
easily
abandoned
the
program
of
the
socialists
in
this
case
liebknecht
perhaps
will
be
made
leader
of
the
socialists
and
it
is
within
the
bounds
of
probability
that
scheidemann
and
certain
of
his
party
may
become
liberals
rather
than
socialists
chapter
xii
diplomatic
negotiations
in
the
autumn
of
the
rush
of
getting
the
americans
out
of
germany
was
over
the
care
of
the
british
civilians
was
on
a
business
basis
and
there
were
comparatively
few
camps
of
prisoners
of
war
absolutely
tired
by
working
every
day
and
until
twelve
at
night
i
went
to
munich
for
a
two
weeks
rest
on
february
fourth
germany
announced
that
on
february
eighteenth
the
blockade
of
england
through
submarines
would
commence
some
very
peculiar
and
mysterious
negotiations
thereafter
ensued
about
february
eighth
an
american
who
was
very
intimate
with
the
members
of
the
general
staff
came
to
me
with
a
statement
that
germany
desired
peace
and
was
ready
to
open
negotiations
to
that
end
it
was
however
to
be
made
a
condition
of
these
peace
negotiations
that
this
particular
american
should
go
to
paris
and
to
petrograd
and
inform
the
governments
there
of
the
overwhelming
strength
of
the
german
armies
and
of
their
positions
which
knowledge
it
was
said
he
had
obtained
by
personally
visiting
both
the
fronts
it
was
further
intimated
that
von
tirpitz
himself
was
anxious
that
peace
should
be
concluded
possibly
because
of
his
fear
that
the
proposed
blockade
would
not
be
successful
of
course
i
informed
the
state
department
of
these
mysterious
manoeuvres
i
was
taken
by
back
stairways
to
a
mysterious
meeting
with
von
tirpitz
at
night
in
his
rooms
in
the
navy
department
when
i
was
alone
with
him
however
he
had
nothing
definite
to
say
or
to
offer
if
there
was
any
opportunity
at
that
time
to
make
peace
nothing
came
of
it
it
looked
somewhat
to
me
as
if
the
whole
idea
had
been
to
get
this
american
to
go
to
paris
and
petrograd
certify
from
his
personal
observation
to
the
strength
of
the
german
armies
and
position
and
thereby
to
assist
in
enticing
one
or
both
of
these
countries
to
desert
the
allied
cause
all
of
this
took
place
about
ten
days
before
the
eighteenth
of
february
the
time
named
for
the
announcement
of
the
blockade
of
england
medals
were
struck
having
the
head
of
von
tirpitz
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
the
words
gott
strafe
england
and
a
picture
of
a
sort
of
neptune
assisted
by
a
submarine
rising
from
the
sea
to
blockade
the
distant
english
coast
the
ambassador
is
supposed
to
have
the
right
to
demand
an
audience
with
the
kaiser
at
any
time
and
as
there
were
matters
connected
with
the
treatment
of
prisoners
as
well
as
this
coming
submarine
warfare
which
i
wished
to
take
up
with
him
i
had
on
various
occasions
asked
for
an
audience
with
him
on
each
occasion
my
request
had
been
refused
on
some
excuse
or
other
and
i
was
not
even
permitted
to
go
to
the
railway
station
to
bid
him
on
one
occasion
when
he
left
for
the
front
when
our
military
attaché
major
langhorne
left
in
march
he
had
a
farewell
audience
with
the
kaiser
and
i
then
asked
him
to
say
to
the
kaiser
that
i
had
not
seen
him
for
so
long
a
time
that
i
had
forgotten
what
he
looked
like
langhorne
reported
to
me
that
he
had
given
his
message
to
the
kaiser
and
that
the
kaiser
said
i
have
nothing
against
gerard
personally
but
i
will
not
see
the
ambassador
of
a
country
which
furnishes
arms
and
ammunition
to
the
enemies
of
germany
before
the
departure
of
langhorne
i
had
succeeded
in
getting
germany
to
agree
that
six
american
army
officers
might
visit
germany
as
military
observers
when
they
arrived
i
presented
them
at
the
foreign
office
and
they
were
taken
on
trips
to
the
east
and
west
fronts
they
were
not
allowed
to
see
much
and
their
request
to
be
attached
to
a
particular
unit
was
refused
nearly
everywhere
they
were
subject
to
insulting
remarks
or
treatment
because
of
the
shipment
of
munitions
of
war
to
the
allies
from
america
and
finally
after
they
had
been
subjected
to
deliberate
insults
at
the
hands
of
several
german
generals
mackensen
particularly
distinguishing
himself
the
united
states
government
withdrew
them
from
germany
colonel
now
general
kuhn
however
who
was
of
these
observers
was
appointed
military
attaché
in
place
of
major
langhorne
speaking
german
fluently
and
acting
with
great
tact
he
managed
for
a
long
time
to
keep
sufficiently
in
the
good
graces
of
the
germans
to
be
allowed
to
see
something
of
the
operations
of
the
various
fronts
there
came
a
period
in
when
he
was
no
longer
invited
to
go
on
the
various
excursions
made
by
the
foreign
military
attachés
and
finally
major
nicolai
the
general
intelligence
officer
of
the
great
general
headquarters
sent
for
him
early
in
the
autumn
of
and
informed
him
that
he
could
no
longer
go
to
any
of
the
fronts
colonel
kuhn
answered
that
he
was
aware
of
this
already
major
nicolai
said
that
he
gave
him
this
information
by
direct
order
of
general
ludendorf
that
general
ludendorf
had
stated
that
he
did
not
believe
america
could
do
more
damage
to
germany
than
she
had
done
if
the
two
countries
were
actually
at
war
and
that
he
considered
that
practically
america
and
germany
were
engaged
in
hostilities
on
this
being
reported
to
washington
colonel
kuhn
was
quite
naturally
recalled
i
can
not
praise
too
highly
the
patience
and
tact
shown
by
colonel
kuhn
in
dealing
with
the
germans
although
accused
in
the
german
newspapers
of
being
a
spy
and
otherwise
attacked
he
kept
his
temper
and
observed
all
that
he
could
for
the
benefit
of
his
own
country
as
he
had
had
an
opportunity
to
observe
the
war
his
experiences
at
that
time
coupled
with
his
experiences
in
germany
make
him
perhaps
our
greatest
american
expert
on
modern
war
it
was
with
the
greatest
pleasure
that
i
heard
from
secretary
baker
that
he
had
determined
to
promote
colonel
kuhn
to
the
rank
of
general
and
make
him
head
of
our
war
college
where
his
teachings
will
prove
of
the
greatest
value
to
the
armies
of
the
united
states
colonel
house
and
his
wife
arrived
to
pay
us
a
visit
on
march
and
remained
until
the
during
this
period
the
colonel
met
all
the
principal
members
of
the
german
government
and
many
men
of
influence
and
prominence
in
the
world
of
affairs
such
as
herr
von
gwinner
head
of
the
deutsche
bank
and
walter
rathenau
who
succeeded
his
father
as
head
of
the
allgemeine
elektricitats
gesellschaft
and
hundreds
of
other
corporations
the
colonel
dined
at
the
house
of
solf
the
colonial
minister
and
lunched
with
von
gwinner
in
april
negotiations
were
continued
about
the
sinking
of
the
an
american
boat
loaded
with
food
and
destined
for
ireland
the
american
government
on
behalf
of
the
owners
of
the
claimed
damages
for
the
boat
nothing
was
said
about
the
cargo
but
in
the
german
answer
it
was
stated
that
the
cargo
of
the
consisting
of
foodstuffs
destined
for
an
armed
port
of
the
enemy
and
therefore
presumed
to
be
destined
for
the
armed
forces
of
the
enemy
was
because
of
this
contraband
i
spoke
to
von
jagow
about
this
and
told
him
that
i
thought
that
possibly
this
would
seem
to
amount
to
a
german
justification
of
the
british
blockade
of
germany
he
said
that
this
note
had
been
drawn
by
director
kriege
who
was
their
expert
on
international
law
and
that
he
would
not
interfere
with
kriege
work
of
course
as
a
matter
of
fact
all
foodstuffs
shipped
to
germany
would
have
to
be
landed
at
some
armed
port
and
therefore
according
to
the
contentions
of
germany
these
would
be
supposed
to
be
destined
to
the
armed
forces
of
the
enemy
and
become
contraband
of
war
at
international
law
it
had
always
been
recognised
that
private
individuals
and
corporations
have
the
right
to
sell
arms
and
ammunitions
of
war
to
any
belligerent
and
in
the
hague
convention
held
in
this
right
was
expressly
ratified
and
confirmed
this
same
director
kriege
who
represented
germany
at
this
hague
conference
in
in
the
debates
on
this
point
said
the
neutral
boats
which
engage
in
such
a
trade
commit
a
violation
of
the
duties
of
neutrality
however
according
to
a
principle
generally
recognised
the
state
of
which
the
boat
flies
the
flag
is
not
responsible
for
this
violation
the
neutral
states
are
not
called
upon
to
forbid
their
subjects
a
commerce
which
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
belligerents
ought
to
be
considered
as
unlawful

during
our
trouble
with
general
huerta
arms
and
ammunition
for
huerta
forces
from
germany
were
landed
from
german
ships
in
mexico
during
the
boer
war
the
germans
who
openly
sympathised
with
the
boers
nevertheless
furnished
to
england
great
quantities
of
arms
and
munitions
expressly
destined
to
be
used
against
the
boers
and
this
although
it
was
manifest
that
there
was
no
possibility
whatever
that
the
boers
could
obtain
arms
and
munitions
from
german
sources
during
the
war
for
instance
the
firm
of
eberhardt
in
dusseldorf
furnished
one
hundred
and
nine
cannon
complete
with
wagons
caissons
and
munitions
to
the
english
which
were
expressly
designed
for
use
against
the
boers
at
one
time
the
imperial
foreign
office
sent
me
a
formal
note
making
reference
to
a
paragraph
in
former
ambassador
andrew
white
autobiography
with
reference
to
the
alleged
stoppage
in
a
german
port
of
a
boat
laden
with
arms
and
ammunition
for
use
against
the
americans
in
cuba
during
the
spanish
war
of
course
former
ambassador
white
wrote
without
having
the
embassy
records
at
hand
and
those
records
show
that
the
position
he
took
at
the
time
of
this
alleged
stoppage
was
eminently
correct
the
files
show
that
he
wrote
the
letter
to
the
state
department
in
which
he
stated
that
knowledge
came
to
him
of
the
proposed
sailing
of
this
ship
but
he
did
not
protest
because
he
had
been
advised
by
a
naval
attaché
that
the
united
states
did
not
have
the
right
to
interfere
the
department
of
state
wrote
to
him
commending
his
action
in
not
filing
any
protest
and
otherwise
interfering
it
seemed
as
if
the
german
government
expressly
desired
to
stir
up
hatred
against
america
on
this
issue
in
order
to
force
the
american
government
through
fear
of
either
the
german
government
or
the
propagandists
at
home
to
put
an
immediate
embargo
on
the
export
of
these
supplies
in
the
autumn
of
zimmermann
showed
me
a
long
list
sent
him
by
bernstorff
showing
quantities
of
saddles
automobiles
motor
trucks
tires
explosives
foodstuffs
and
so
on
exported
from
america
to
the
allies
and
intimated
that
this
traffic
had
reached
such
proportions
that
it
should
be
stopped
in
february
in
the
official
of
the
day
appeared
the
following
statement
heavy
artillery
fire
in
certain
sections
of
the
west
front
mostly
with
american
ammunition
and
in
april
in
the
official
something
to
this
effect
captured
french
artillery
officers
say
that
they
have
great
stores
of
american
ammunition
i
obtained
through
the
state
department
in
washington
a
statement
from
the
french
ambassador
certifying
that
up
to
that
time
the
end
of
april
no
shells
whatever
of
the
french
artillery
had
been
furnished
from
america
nothing
however
would
satisfy
the
germans
they
seemed
determined
that
the
export
of
every
article
whether
of
food
or
munitions
which
might
prove
of
use
to
the
allies
in
the
war
should
be
stopped
newspapers
were
filled
with
bitter
attacks
upon
america
and
upon
president
wilson
and
with
caricatures
referring
to
the
sale
of
munitions
it
never
seemed
to
occur
to
the
germans
that
we
could
not
violate
the
hague
convention
in
order
to
change
the
rules
of
the
game
because
one
party
after
the
commencement
of
hostilities
found
that
the
rule
worked
to
his
disadvantage
nor
did
the
germans
consider
that
america
could
not
vary
its
international
law
with
the
changing
fortunes
of
war
and
make
one
ruling
when
the
germans
lost
control
of
the
sea
and
another
ruling
if
they
regained
it
from
early
in
until
i
left
germany
i
do
not
think
i
ever
had
a
conversation
with
a
german
without
his
alluding
to
this
question
shortly
before
leaving
germany
in
january
and
after
i
had
learned
of
the
probability
of
the
resumption
of
ruthless
submarine
war
at
an
evening
party
at
the
house
of
solf
the
colonial
minister
a
large
german
who
turned
out
to
be
one
of
the
grand
dukes
of
planted
himself
some
distance
away
from
me
and
addressed
me
in
german
saying
you
are
the
american
ambassador
and
i
want
to
tell
you
that
the
conduct
of
america
in
furnishing
arms
and
ammunition
to
the
enemies
of
germany
is
stamped
deep
on
the
german
heart
that
we
will
never
forget
it
and
will
some
day
have
our
revenge
he
spoke
in
a
voice
so
loud
and
slapped
his
chest
so
hard
that
everyone
in
the
room
stopped
their
conversation
in
order
to
hear
he
wore
on
his
breast
the
orders
of
the
black
eagle
the
red
eagle
the
elephant
and
the
seraphim
and
when
he
struck
all
this
menagerie
the
rattle
alone
was
quite
loud
i
reminded
him
politely
of
the
hague
convention
of
the
fact
that
we
could
not
change
international
law
from
time
to
time
with
the
change
in
the
situation
of
the
war
and
that
germany
had
furnished
arms
to
england
to
use
against
the
boers
but
he
simply
answered
we
care
nothing
for
treaties
and
my
answer
that
is
what
they
all
say
was
a
retort
too
obvious
to
be
omitted
the
german
press
continually
published
articles
to
the
effect
that
the
war
would
be
finished
if
it
were
not
for
the
shipment
of
supplies
from
america
all
public
opinion
was
with
the
german
government
when
the
warning
was
issued
on
february
fourth
stating
that
the
blockade
of
england
would
commence
on
the
eighteenth
and
warning
neutral
ships
to
keep
out
of
the
war
zone
from
then
on
we
had
constant
cases
and
crises
with
reference
to
the
sinking
of
american
boats
by
the
german
submarine
there
were
the
cases
of
the
and
the
and
the
an
english
boat
sunk
without
warning
on
which
americans
were
killed
on
may
sixth
director
kriege
of
the
foreign
office
asked
jackson
to
call
and
see
him
and
told
him
that
he
would
like
to
have
the
following
three
points
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
american
public
as
the
result
of
the
english
effort
to
stop
all
foreign
commerce
with
germany
germany
would
do
everything
in
her
power
to
destroy
english
commerce
and
merchant
shipping
there
was
however
never
at
any
time
an
intention
to
destroy
or
interfere
with
neutral
commerce
or
to
attack
neutral
shipping
unless
engaged
in
contraband
trade
in
view
of
the
action
of
the
british
government
in
arming
merchant
vessels
and
causing
them
to
disguise
their
national
character
the
occasional
destruction
of
a
neutral
ship
was
unavoidable
naval
officers
in
command
of
submarines
had
been
instructed
originally
and
new
and
more
stringent
instructions
had
been
issued
repeatedly
to
use
the
utmost
care
consistent
with
their
own
safety
to
avoid
attacks
on
neutral
vessels
in
case
a
neutral
ship
should
be
destroyed
by
a
submarine
the
german
government
is
prepared
to
make
an
immediate
and
formal
expression
of
its
regret
and
to
pay
an
indemnity
without
having
recourse
to
a
prize
court
all
reports
with
regard
to
the
destruction
of
a
neutral
vessel
by
a
german
submarine
are
investigated
at
once
by
both
the
german
foreign
office
and
admiralty
and
the
result
is
communicated
to
the
government
concerned
which
is
requested
in
return
to
communicate
to
the
german
government
the
result
of
its
own
independent
investigation
where
there
is
any
material
divergence
in
the
two
reports
as
to
the
presumed
cause
of
destruction
torpedo
or
mine
the
question
is
to
be
submitted
to
investigation
by
a
commission
composed
of
representatives
of
the
two
nations
concerned
with
a
neutral
arbiter
whose
decision
will
be
final
this
course
has
already
been
adopted
in
two
cases
in
which
a
dutch
and
a
norwegian
vessel
respectively
were
concerned
the
german
government
reserves
its
right
to
refuse
this
international
arbitration
in
exceptional
cases
where
for
military
reasons
the
german
admiralty
are
opposed
to
its
taking
place
director
kriege
told
jackson
that
a
written
communication
in
which
the
substance
of
the
foregoing
would
be
contained
would
soon
to
be
made
to
the
embassy
jackson
put
this
conversation
down
in
the
form
above
given
and
showed
director
kriege
a
copy
of
it
later
in
the
day
geheimrat
simon
called
on
jackson
at
the
embassy
and
said
that
kriege
would
like
to
have
point
two
read
as
follows
in
case
any
unfortunate
mistake
a
neutral
and
continuing
to
the
end
and
that
kriege
would
like
to
change
what
was
written
on
point
three
beginning
with
where
there
is
so
that
it
should
read
as
follows
where
there
is
any
material
divergence
in
the
two
reports
as
to
the
presumed
cause
of
destruction
torpedo
or
mine
the
german
government
has
already
in
several
instances
declared
its
readiness
to
submit
the
question
to
the
decision
of
an
international
commission
in
accordance
with
the
hague
convention
for
the
friendly
settlement
of
international
disputes
this
had
been
suggested
by
director
kriege
in
case
it
should
be
decided
to
make
a
communication
to
the
american
press
jackson
told
geheimrat
simon
that
he
would
report
the
subject
of
his
conversation
to
me
but
that
it
would
depend
upon
me
whether
any
communication
should
be
made
to
the
american
government
or
to
the
press
upon
the
subject
of
course
the
news
of
the
torpedoing
of
the
on
may
seventh
and
of
the
great
loss
of
american
lives
brought
about
a
very
critical
situation
and
naturally
nothing
was
done
with
kriege
propositions
it
is
unnecessary
here
for
me
to
go
into
the
notes
which
were
exchanged
between
the
two
governments
because
all
that
is
already
public
property
sometime
after
i
had
delivered
our
first
note
of
may
zimmermann
was
lunching
with
us
a
good
looking
american
woman
married
to
a
german
was
also
of
the
party
and
after
lunch
although
i
was
talking
to
some
one
else
i
overheard
part
of
her
conversation
with
zimmermann
when
zimmermann
left
i
asked
her
what
it
was
that
he
had
said
about
america
germany
bryan
and
the
she
then
told
me
that
she
had
said
to
zimmermann
that
it
was
a
great
pity
that
we
were
to
leave
berlin
as
it
looked
as
if
diplomatic
relations
between
the
two
countries
would
be
broken
and
that
zimmermann
told
her
not
to
worry
about
that
because
they
had
just
received
word
from
the
austrian
government
that
dumba
the
austrian
ambassador
in
washington
had
cabled
that
the
note
from
america
to
germany
was
only
sent
as
a
sop
to
public
opinion
in
america
and
that
the
government
did
not
really
mean
what
was
said
in
that
note
i
then
called
on
zimmermann
at
the
foreign
office
and
he
showed
me
dumba
telegram
which
was
substantially
as
stated
above
of
course
i
immediately
cabled
to
the
state
department
and
also
got
word
to
president
wilson
the
rest
of
the
incident
is
public
property
i
of
course
did
not
know
what
actually
occurred
between
bryan
and
dumba
but
i
am
sure
that
dumba
must
have
misunderstood
friendly
statements
made
by
bryan
it
was
very
lucky
that
i
discovered
the
existence
of
this
dumba
cablegram
in
this
manner
which
savours
almost
of
diplomacy
as
represented
on
the
stage
if
the
germans
had
gone
on
in
the
belief
that
the
note
was
not
really
meant
war
would
have
inevitably
resulted
at
that
time
between
germany
and
america
and
it
shows
how
great
events
may
be
shaped
by
heavy
luncheons
and
a
pretty
woman
before
this
time
much
indignation
had
been
caused
in
germany
by
the
fact
that
the
on
her
eastward
voyage
from
new
york
early
in
february
had
raised
the
american
flag
when
nearing
british
waters
shortly
after
this
incident
had
become
known
i
was
at
the
wintergarten
a
large
concert
hall
in
berlin
with
grant
smith
first
secretary
of
the
embassy
at
vienna
and
other
members
of
my
staff
we
naturally
spoke
english
among
ourselves
a
fact
which
aroused
the
ire
of
a
german
who
had
been
drinking
heavily
and
who
was
seated
in
the
next
box
he
immediately
began
to
call
out
that
some
one
was
speaking
english
and
when
told
by
one
of
the
attendants
that
it
was
the
american
ambassador
he
immediately
cried
in
a
loud
voice
that
americans
were
even
worse
than
english
and
that
the
had
been
flying
the
american
flag
as
protection
in
british
waters
the
audience
however
took
sides
against
him
and
told
him
to
shut
up
and
as
i
left
the
house
at
the
close
of
the
performance
some
germans
spoke
to
me
and
apologised
for
his
conduct
the
next
day
the
manager
of
the
wintergarten
called
on
me
also
to
express
his
regret
for
the
occurrence
about
a
year
afterwards
i
was
at
the
races
one
day
and
saw
this
man
and
asked
him
what
he
meant
by
making
such
a
noise
at
the
wintergarten
he
immediately
apologised
and
said
that
he
had
been
drinking
and
hoped
that
i
would
forget
the
incident
this
was
the
only
incident
of
the
kind
which
occurred
to
me
during
all
the
time
that
i
was
in
germany
both
before
and
after
the
sinking
of
the
the
german
foreign
office
put
forward
all
kinds
of
proposals
with
reference
to
american
ships
in
the
war
zone
on
one
afternoon
zimmermann
who
had
a
number
of
these
proposals
drafted
in
german
showed
them
to
me
and
i
wrote
down
the
english
translation
for
him
to
see
how
it
would
look
in
english
these
proposals
were
about
the
sailing
from
america
of
what
might
be
called
certified
ships
the
ships
to
be
painted
and
striped
in
a
distinctive
way
to
come
from
certified
ports
at
certain
certified
times
america
to
agree
that
these
ships
should
carry
no
contraband
whatever
all
these
proposals
were
sternly
rejected
by
the
president
on
february
sixteenth
the
german
answer
to
our
note
of
february
tenth
had
announced
that
germany
declined
all
responsibility
for
what
might
happen
to
neutral
ships
and
in
addition
announced
that
mines
would
be
allowed
in
waters
surrounding
great
britain
and
ireland
this
note
also
contained
one
of
zimmermann
proposed
solutions
namely
that
american
warships
should
convoy
american
merchantmen
the
german
note
of
the
sixteenth
also
spoke
about
the
great
traffic
in
munitions
from
the
united
states
to
the
allies
and
contained
a
suggestion
that
the
united
states
should
induce
the
allies
to
adopt
the
declaration
of
london
and
omit
the
importation
not
only
of
food
but
also
of
all
raw
materials
into
germany
february
twentieth
was
the
date
of
the
conciliatory
note
addressed
by
president
wilson
to
both
great
britain
and
germany
and
contained
the
suggestion
that
submarines
should
not
be
employed
against
merchant
vessels
of
any
nationality
and
that
food
should
be
allowed
to
go
through
for
the
civil
population
of
germany
consigned
to
the
agencies
named
by
the
united
states
in
germany
which
were
to
see
that
the
food
was
received
and
distributed
to
the
civil
population
in
the
meantime
the
mines
on
the
german
coast
had
destroyed
two
american
ships
both
loaded
with
cotton
for
germany
one
called
the
and
the
other
the
in
america
congress
refused
to
pass
a
law
to
put
it
in
the
power
of
the
president
to
place
an
embargo
on
the
export
of
munitions
of
war
in
april
count
bernstorff
delivered
his
note
concerning
the
alleged
want
of
neutrality
of
the
united
states
referring
to
the
numerous
new
industries
in
war
materials
being
built
up
in
the
united
states
stating
in
reality
the
united
states
is
supplying
only
germany
enemies
a
fact
which
is
not
in
any
way
modified
by
the
theoretical
willingness
to
furnish
germany
as
well
to
this
note
secretary
bryan
in
a
note
replied
that
it
was
impossible
in
view
of
the
indisputable
doctrines
of
accepted
international
law
to
make
any
change
in
our
own
laws
of
neutrality
which
meant
unequally
affecting
during
the
progress
of
the
war
the
relations
of
the
united
states
with
the
various
nations
at
war
and
that
the
placing
of
embargoes
on
the
trade
in
arms
which
constituted
such
a
change
would
be
a
direct
violation
of
the
neutrality
of
the
united
states
but
all
these
negotiations
reproaches
and
recriminations
were
put
an
end
to
by
the
torpedoing
of
the
with
the
killing
of
american
women
and
civilians
who
were
passengers
on
that
vessel
i
believed
myself
that
we
would
immediately
break
diplomatic
relations
and
prepared
to
leave
germany
on
may
eleventh
i
delivered
to
von
jagow
the
note
which
after
calling
attention
to
the
cases
of
the
sinking
of
american
boats
ending
with
the
contained
the
statement
the
imperial
german
government
will
not
expect
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
omit
any
word
or
any
act
necessary
to
the
sacred
duty
of
maintaining
the
rights
of
the
united
states
and
its
citizens
and
of
safeguarding
their
free
exercises
and
enjoyments
during
this
period
i
had
constant
conversations
with
von
jagow
and
zimmermann
and
it
was
during
the
conversations
about
this
submarine
warfare
that
zimmermann
on
one
occasion
said
to
me
the
united
states
does
not
dare
to
do
anything
against
germany
because
we
have
five
hundred
thousand
german
reservists
in
america
who
will
rise
in
arms
against
your
government
if
your
government
should
dare
to
take
any
action
against
germany
as
he
said
this
he
worked
himself
up
to
a
passion
and
repeatedly
struck
the
table
with
his
fist
i
told
him
that
we
had
five
hundred
and
one
thousand
lamp
posts
in
america
and
that
was
where
the
german
reservists
would
find
themselves
if
they
tried
any
uprising
and
i
also
called
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
no
making
use
of
the
american
passports
which
they
could
easily
obtain
were
sailing
for
germany
by
way
of
scandinavian
countries
in
order
to
enlist
in
the
german
army
i
told
him
that
if
he
could
show
me
one
person
with
an
american
passport
who
had
come
to
fight
in
the
german
army
i
might
more
readily
believe
what
he
said
about
the
germans
in
america
rising
in
revolution
as
a
matter
of
fact
during
the
whole
course
of
the
war
i
knew
of
only
one
man
with
american
citizenship
who
enlisted
in
the
german
army
this
was
an
american
student
then
in
germany
who
enlisted
in
a
german
regiment
his
father
a
business
man
in
new
york
cabled
me
asking
me
to
have
his
son
released
from
the
german
army
so
i
procured
the
discharge
of
the
young
man
who
immediately
wrote
to
me
and
informed
me
that
he
was
over
and
that
he
could
not
see
what
business
his
father
had
to
interfere
with
his
military
ambitions
i
thereupon
withdrew
my
request
with
reference
to
him
but
he
had
already
been
discharged
from
the
army
when
his
regiment
went
to
the
west
front
he
stowed
away
on
the
cars
with
it
was
present
at
the
attack
on
ypres
and
was
shot
through
the
body
he
recovered
in
a
german
hospital
received
the
iron
cross
was
discharged
and
sailed
for
america
what
has
since
become
of
him
i
do
not
know
i
do
not
intend
to
go
in
great
detail
into
this
exchange
of
notes
and
the
public
history
of
the
submarine
controversy
as
all
that
properly
belongs
to
the
history
of
the
war
rather
than
to
an
account
of
my
personal
experiences
and
besides
as
victor
hugo
said
history
is
not
written
with
a
microscope
all
will
remember
the
answer
of
germany
to
the
american
note
which
answer
delivered
on
may
contained
the
charge
that
the
was
armed
and
carried
munitions
and
had
been
used
in
the
transport
of
canadian
troops
in
the
meantime
however
the
american
ship
had
been
torpedoed
off
the
coast
of
ireland
on
the
and
on
may
germany
stated
that
the
american
steamer
had
been
torpedoed
by
mistake
and
apologised
for
this
act
von
jagow
gave
me
about
the
same
time
a
note
requesting
that
american
vessels
should
be
more
plainly
marked
and
should
illuminate
their
marking
at
night
the
second
american
note
was
published
on
june
eleventh
and
its
delivery
was
coincident
with
the
resignation
of
bryan
as
secretary
of
state
in
this
last
note
president
wilson
for
of
course
it
is
an
open
secret
that
he
was
the
author
of
these
notes
made
the
issue
perfectly
plain
referring
to
the
torpedoing
of
enemy
passenger
ships
only
her
actual
resistance
to
capture
or
refusal
to
stop
when
ordered
to
do
so
for
the
purpose
of
visit
could
have
afforded
the
commander
of
the
submarine
any
justification
for
so
much
as
putting
the
lives
of
those
on
board
the
ship
in
jeopardy
on
july
eighth
the
german
answer
to
this
american
note
was
delivered
and
again
stated
that
we
have
been
obliged
to
adopt
a
submarine
war
to
meet
the
declared
intentions
of
our
enemies
and
the
method
of
warfare
adopted
by
them
in
contravention
of
international
law
again
referring
to
the
alleged
fact
of
the
carrying
munitions
they
said
if
the
had
been
spared
thousands
of
cases
of
munitions
would
have
been
sent
to
germany
enemies
and
thereby
thousands
of
german
mothers
and
children
robbed
of
breadwinners
the
note
then
contained
some
of
zimmermann
favourite
proposals
to
the
effect
that
german
submarine
commanders
would
be
instructed
to
permit
the
passage
of
american
steamers
marked
in
a
special
way
and
of
whose
sailing
they
had
been
notified
in
advance
provided
that
the
american
government
guaranteed
that
these
vessels
did
not
carry
contraband
of
war
it
was
also
suggested
that
a
number
of
neutral
vessels
should
be
added
to
those
sailing
under
the
american
flag
to
give
greater
opportunity
for
those
americans
who
were
compelled
to
travel
abroad
and
the
note
most
important
part
continued
in
particular
the
imperial
government
is
unable
to
admit
that
the
american
citizens
can
protect
an
enemy
ship
by
mere
fact
of
their
presence
on
board
july
the
american
government
rejected
the
proposals
of
germany
saying
the
lives
of
noncombatants
may
in
no
case
be
put
in
jeopardy
unless
the
vessel
resists
or
seeks
to
escape
after
being
summoned
to
submit
to
examination
and
disposed
of
the
claim
that
the
acts
of
england
gave
germany
the
right
to
retaliate
even
though
american
citizens
should
be
deprived
of
their
lives
in
the
course
of
retaliation
by
stating
for
a
belligerent
act
of
retaliation
is
an
act
beyond
the
law
and
the
defense
of
an
act
as
retaliatory
is
an
admission
that
it
is
illegal
continuing
it
said
if
a
belligerent
can
not
retaliate
against
an
enemy
without
injuring
the
lives
of
neutrals
as
well
as
their
property
humanity
as
well
as
justice
and
a
due
regard
for
the
dignity
of
neutral
powers
should
dictate
that
the
practice
be
discontinued
it
was
also
said
the
united
states
can
not
believe
that
the
imperial
government
will
longer
refrain
from
disavowing
the
wanton
act
of
its
naval
commander
in
sinking
the
or
from
offering
reparation
for
the
american
lives
lost
so
far
as
reparation
can
be
made
for
the
needless
destruction
of
human
life
by
an
illegal
act
and
the
meat
of
the
note
was
contained
in
the
following
sentence
friendship
itself
prompts
it
the
united
states
to
say
to
the
imperial
government
that
repetition
by
the
commanders
of
german
naval
vessels
of
acts
in
contravention
of
those
rights
must
be
regarded
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
when
they
affect
american
citizens
as
being
deliberately
unfriendly
there
the
matter
has
remained
so
far
as
the
lusitania
was
concerned
until
now
in
the
meantime
the
attack
of
the
american
ship
was
disavowed
the
german
note
stating
that
the
torpedo
was
not
meant
for
the
american
flag
and
is
to
be
considered
an
unfortunate
accident
the
diplomatic
situation
with
regard
to
the
use
of
the
submarine
and
the
attack
on
many
merchant
ships
without
notice
and
without
putting
the
passengers
in
safety
was
still
unsettled
when
on
august
nineteenth
the
british
ship
was
torpedoed
without
warning
not
far
from
the
place
where
the
had
gone
down
two
americans
were
among
the
passengers
killed
the
german
government
after
the
usual
quibbling
at
length
in
its
note
of
september
seventh
claimed
that
the
captain
of
the
german
submarine
while
engaged
in
preparing
to
sink
the
became
convinced
that
the
approaching
was
trying
to
ram
him
and
therefore
fired
his
torpedo
the
imperial
government
refused
to
admit
any
liability
but
offered
to
arbitrate
there
followed
almost
immediately
the
case
of
the
sunk
by
a
submarine
flying
the
austrian
flag
this
case
was
naturally
out
of
my
jurisdiction
but
formed
a
link
in
the
chain
and
then
came
the
sinking
of
the
in
the
mediterranean
on
this
boat
our
consul
to
aden
lost
his
life
in
the
note
of
count
bernstorff
to
secretary
lansing
dated
september
first
count
bernstorff
said
that
liners
would
not
be
sunk
by
german
submarines
without
warning
and
without
putting
the
passengers
in
safety
provided
that
the
liners
did
not
try
to
escape
or
offer
resistance
and
it
was
further
stated
that
this
policy
was
in
effect
before
the
sinking
of
the
there
were
long
negotiations
during
this
period
concerning
the
at
one
time
it
looked
as
if
diplomatic
relations
would
be
broken
but
finally
the
imperial
government
consented
to
acknowledge
that
the
submarine
commander
had
been
wrong
in
assuming
that
the
intended
to
ram
his
boat
offered
to
pay
an
indemnity
and
disavowed
the
act
of
the
commander
it
was
stated
that
orders
so
precise
had
been
given
to
the
submarine
commanders
that
a
recurrence
of
incidents
similar
to
the
is
considered
out
of
the
question
in
the
same
way
the
austrian
government
gave
way
to
the
demands
of
america
in
the
case
at
the
end
of
december
ambassador
penfield
in
austria
won
great
praise
by
his
admirable
handling
of
this
case
the
negotiations
as
to
the
still
pending
case
were
carried
on
in
washington
by
count
bernstorff
and
secretary
lansing
and
finally
germany
offered
to
pay
an
indemnity
for
the
death
of
the
americans
on
the
whose
deaths
germany
greatly
regretted
but
refused
to
disavow
the
act
of
the
submarine
commander
in
sinking
the
or
to
admit
that
such
act
was
illegal
about
this
time
our
state
department
sent
out
a
note
proposing
in
effect
that
submarines
should
conform
to
cruiser
warfare
only
sinking
a
vessel
which
defended
itself
or
tried
to
escape
and
that
before
sinking
a
vessel
its
passengers
and
crew
should
be
placed
in
safety
and
that
on
the
other
hand
merchant
vessels
of
belligerent
nationality
should
be
prohibited
from
carrying
any
armaments
whatever
this
suggestion
was
not
followed
up
zimmermann
not
the
one
in
the
foreign
office
wrote
an
article
in
the
of
which
he
is
an
editor
saying
that
the
united
states
had
something
on
their
side
in
the
question
of
the
export
of
munitions
i
heard
that
von
kessel
commander
of
the
of
said
that
he
zimmermann
ought
to
be
shot
as
a
traitor
zimmermann
hearing
of
this
made
von
kessel
apologise
but
was
shortly
afterwards
mobilised
colonel
house
had
arrived
in
germany
at
the
end
of
january
and
remained
only
three
days
he
was
quite
worried
by
the
situation
and
by
an
interview
he
had
had
with
zimmermann
in
which
zimmermann
expressed
the
readiness
of
germany
to
go
to
war
with
the
united
states
in
february
the
junkers
in
the
prussian
lower
house
started
a
fight
against
the
chancellor
and
discussed
submarine
war
a
matter
out
of
their
province
the
chancellor
hit
back
at
them
hard
and
had
the
best
of
the
exchange
at
this
period
it
was
reported
that
the
emperor
went
to
wilhelmshafen
to
warn
the
submarine
commanders
to
be
careful
about
march
first
it
was
reported
that
a
grand
council
of
war
was
held
at
charleville
and
that
in
spite
of
the
support
of
von
tirpitz
by
falkenhayn
the
chief
of
staff
the
chancellor
was
supported
by
the
emperor
and
once
more
beat
the
propositions
to
recommence
ruthless
submarine
war
in
march
too
the
illness
of
von
tirpitz
was
announced
followed
shortly
by
his
resignation
on
march
nineteenth
his
birthday
a
demonstration
was
looked
for
and
i
saw
many
police
near
his
dwelling
but
nothing
unusual
occurred
i
contemplated
a
trip
to
america
but
both
the
chancellor
and
von
jagow
begged
me
not
to
go
from
the
time
of
the
sinking
to
that
of
the
all
germany
was
divided
into
two
camps
the
party
of
the
chancellor
tried
to
keep
peace
with
america
and
did
not
want
to
have
germany
branded
as
an
outlaw
among
nations
von
tirpitz
and
his
party
of
naval
and
military
officers
called
for
ruthless
submarine
war
and
the
conservatives
angry
with
because
of
his
proposed
concession
as
to
the
extension
of
the
suffrage
joined
the
opposition
the
reception
of
our
last
note
in
july
was
hostile
and
i
was
accused
of
being
against
germany
although
of
course
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
preparation
of
this
note
in
august
the
deputies
representing
the
great
industrials
of
germany
joined
in
the
attack
on
the
chancellor
these
men
wished
to
keep
northern
france
and
belgium
because
they
hoped
to
get
possession
of
the
coal
and
iron
deposits
there
and
so
obtain
a
monopoly
of
the
iron
and
steel
trade
of
the
continent
accelerators
of
public
opinion
undoubtedly
hired
by
the
krupp
firm
were
hard
at
work
these
annexationists
were
opposed
by
the
more
reasonable
men
who
signed
a
petition
against
the
annexation
of
belgium
among
the
signers
of
this
reasonable
men
petition
were
prince
hatzfeld
duke
of
trachenberg
head
of
the
red
cross
dernburg
prince
henkel
donnersmarck
professor
delbrück
von
harnack
and
many
others
the
rage
of
the
conservatives
at
the
settlement
knew
no
bounds
and
after
a
bitter
article
had
appeared
in
the
about
the
affair
that
newspaper
was
suppressed
for
some
days
a
rather
unexpected
showing
of
backbone
on
the
part
of
the
chancellor
reventlow
who
wrote
for
this
newspaper
is
one
of
the
ablest
editorial
writers
in
germany
an
officer
he
is
bitter
in
his
hatred
of
america
it
was
said
that
he
once
lived
in
america
and
lost
a
small
fortune
in
a
florida
orange
grove
but
i
never
succeeded
in
having
this
verified
in
november
after
the
settlement
there
followed
a
moment
for
us
of
comparative
calm
gerard
was
given
the
red
cross
orders
of
the
first
and
third
classes
and
jackson
and
rives
of
the
embassy
staff
the
second
and
third
class
the
third
class
is
always
given
because
one
can
not
have
the
first
and
second
unless
one
has
the
third
or
lowest
there
were
rumours
at
this
time
of
the
formation
of
a
new
party
really
the
socialists
and
liberals
as
the
socialists
as
such
were
too
unfashionable
in
too
bad
odour
to
open
a
campaign
against
the
military
under
their
own
name
this
talk
came
to
nothing
the
chancellor
always
complained
bitterly
that
he
could
not
communicate
in
cipher
wireless
with
von
bernstorff
on
one
occasion
he
said
to
me
how
can
i
arrange
as
i
wish
to
in
a
friendly
way
the
and
cases
if
i
can
not
communicate
with
my
ambassador
why
does
the
united
states
government
not
allow
me
to
communicate
in
cipher
i
said
the
foreign
office
tried
to
get
me
to
procure
a
for
the
notorious
von
rintelen
on
the
pretense
that
he
was
going
to
do
charitable
work
for
belgium
in
america
perhaps
washington
thinks
you
want
to
communicate
with
people
like
that
the
chancellor
then
changed
the
subject
and
said
that
there
would
be
bad
feeling
in
germany
against
america
after
the
war
i
answered
that
that
idea
had
been
expressed
by
a
great
many
germans
and
german
newspapers
and
that
i
had
had
private
letters
from
a
great
many
americans
who
wrote
that
if
germany
intended
to
make
war
on
america
after
this
war
perhaps
we
had
better
go
in
now
he
then
very
amiably
said
that
war
with
america
would
be
ridiculous
he
asked
me
why
public
opinion
in
america
was
against
germany
and
i
answered
that
matters
like
the
cavell
case
had
made
a
bad
impression
in
america
and
that
i
knew
personally
that
even
the
kaiser
did
not
approve
of
the
torpedoing
of
the
the
chancellor
said
how
about
the
i
replied
that
i
did
not
know
the
details
and
that
there
seemed
much
doubt
and
confusion
about
that
affair
but
that
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
fact
that
miss
cavell
was
shot
and
that
she
was
a
woman
i
then
took
up
in
detail
with
him
the
treatment
of
british
prisoners
and
said
that
this
bad
treatment
could
not
go
on
this
was
only
one
of
the
many
times
when
i
complained
to
the
chancellor
about
the
condition
of
prisoners
i
am
sure
that
he
did
not
approve
of
the
manner
in
which
prisoners
of
war
in
germany
were
treated
but
he
always
complained
that
he
was
powerless
where
the
military
were
concerned
and
always
referred
me
to
bismarck
memoirs
during
this
winter
of
submarine
controversy
an
interview
with
von
tirpitz
thinly
veiled
as
an
interview
with
a
high
naval
authority
was
published
in
that
usually
most
conservative
of
newspapers
the
in
this
interview
the
high
naval
authority
advocated
ruthless
submarine
war
with
england
and
promised
to
bring
about
thereby
the
speedy
surrender
of
that
country
after
the
surrender
which
was
to
include
the
whole
british
fleet
the
german
fleet
with
the
surrendered
british
fleet
added
to
its
force
was
to
sail
for
america
and
exact
from
that
country
indemnities
enough
to
pay
the
whole
cost
of
the
war
after
his
fall
von
tirpitz
in
a
letter
to
some
admirers
who
had
sent
him
verses
and
a
wreath
advocated
holding
the
coast
of
flanders
as
a
necessity
for
the
war
against
england
and
america
the
successor
of
von
tirpitz
was
admiral
von
holtzendorff
whose
brother
is
ballin
right
hand
man
in
the
management
of
the
hamburg
american
line
because
of
the
more
reasonable
influence
and
surroundings
of
von
holtzendorff
i
regarded
his
appointment
as
a
help
towards
peaceful
relations
between
germany
and
america
i
have
told
in
another
chapter
how
the
emperor
had
refused
to
receive
me
as
ambassador
of
a
country
which
was
supplying
munitions
to
the
allies
from
time
to
time
since
i
learned
of
this
in
march
i
kept
insisting
upon
my
right
as
ambassador
to
be
received
by
the
emperor
and
finally
early
in
october
wrote
the
following
letter
to
the
chancellor
your
excellency
some
time
ago
i
requested
you
to
arrange
an
audience
for
me
with
his
majesty
please
take
no
further
trouble
about
this
matter
sincerely
yours
james
w
gerard
this
seemed
to
have
the
desired
effect
i
was
informed
that
i
would
be
received
by
the
emperor
in
the
new
palace
at
potsdam
on
october
he
was
then
to
pay
a
flying
visit
to
berlin
to
receive
the
new
peruvian
minister
and
one
or
two
others
we
went
down
in
the
train
to
potsdam
von
jagow
accompanying
us
in
the
morning
and
it
was
arranged
that
we
should
return
on
the
train
leaving
potsdam
a
little
after
one
i
think
that
the
authorities
of
the
palace
expected
that
i
would
be
with
the
emperor
for
a
few
minutes
only
as
when
i
was
shown
into
the
room
where
he
was
a
large
room
opening
from
the
famous
shell
hall
of
the
palace
the
peruvian
minister
and
the
others
to
be
received
were
standing
waiting
in
that
hall
the
emperor
was
alone
in
the
room
and
no
one
was
present
at
our
interview
he
was
dressed
in
a
hussar
uniform
of
the
new
field
grey
the
parade
uniform
of
which
the
frogs
and
trimmings
were
of
gold
a
large
table
in
the
corner
of
the
room
was
covered
with
maps
compasses
scales
and
rulers
and
looked
as
if
the
emperor
there
in
company
with
some
of
his
aides
or
possibly
the
chief
of
staff
had
been
working
out
the
plan
of
campaign
of
the
german
armies
the
emperor
was
standing
so
naturally
i
stood
also
and
according
to
his
habit
which
is
quite
rooseveltian
he
stood
very
close
to
me
and
talked
very
earnestly
i
was
fortunately
able
to
clear
up
two
distinct
points
which
he
had
against
america
the
emperor
said
that
he
had
read
in
a
german
paper
that
a
number
of
submarines
built
in
america
for
england
had
crossed
the
atlantic
to
england
escorted
by
ships
of
the
american
navy
i
was
of
course
able
to
deny
this
ridiculous
story
at
the
time
and
furnish
definite
proofs
later
the
emperor
complained
because
a
loan
to
england
and
france
had
been
floated
in
america
i
said
that
the
first
loan
to
a
belligerent
floated
in
america
was
a
loan
to
germany
the
emperor
sent
for
some
of
his
staff
and
immediately
inquired
into
the
matter
the
members
of
the
staff
confirmed
my
statement
the
emperor
said
that
he
would
not
have
permitted
the
torpedoing
of
the
if
he
had
known
and
that
no
gentleman
would
kill
so
many
women
and
children
he
showed
however
great
bitterness
against
the
united
states
and
repeatedly
said
america
had
better
look
out
after
this
war
and
i
shall
stand
no
nonsense
from
america
after
the
war
the
interview
lasted
about
an
hour
and
a
quarter
and
when
i
finally
emerged
from
the
room
the
officers
of
the
emperor
household
were
in
such
a
state
of
agitation
that
i
feel
sure
they
must
have
thought
that
something
fearful
had
occurred
as
i
walked
rapidly
towards
the
door
of
the
palace
in
order
to
take
the
carriage
which
was
to
drive
me
to
the
train
one
of
them
walked
along
beside
me
saying
is
it
all
right
is
it
all
right
the
unfortunate
diplomats
who
were
to
have
been
received
and
who
had
been
standing
all
this
time
outside
the
door
waiting
for
an
audience
missed
their
train
and
their
luncheon
at
this
interview
the
emperor
looked
very
careworn
and
seemed
nervous
when
i
next
saw
him
however
which
was
not
until
the
end
of
april
he
was
in
much
better
condition
i
was
so
fearful
in
reporting
the
dangerous
part
of
this
interview
on
account
of
the
many
spies
not
only
in
my
own
embassy
but
also
in
the
state
department
that
i
sent
but
a
very
few
words
in
a
roundabout
way
by
courier
direct
to
the
president
the
year
opened
with
this
great
question
still
unsettled
and
in
effect
germany
gave
notice
that
after
march
first
the
german
submarines
would
sink
all
armed
merchantmen
of
the
enemies
of
germany
without
warning
it
is
not
my
place
here
to
go
into
the
agitation
of
this
question
in
america
or
into
the
history
of
the
votes
in
congress
which
in
fact
upheld
the
policy
of
the
president
a
proposal
as
to
armed
merchantmen
was
issued
by
our
state
department
and
the
position
taken
in
this
was
apparently
abandoned
at
the
time
of
the
settlement
of
the
case
to
which
i
now
refer
in
the
latter
half
of
march
a
number
of
boats
having
americans
on
board
were
torpedoed
without
warning
these
boats
were
the
the
the
and
the
one
american
was
killed
or
drowned
on
the
but
the
issue
finally
came
to
a
head
over
the
torpedoing
of
the
channel
passenger
boat
which
carried
passengers
between
folkstone
and
dieppe
france
on
march
the
was
torpedoed
near
the
coast
of
france
four
hundred
and
persons
of
whom
were
americans
were
on
board
the
captain
and
a
number
of
the
passengers
saw
the
torpedo
and
an
endeavour
was
made
to
avoid
it
after
the
boat
was
struck
the
many
passengers
took
to
the
boats
three
americans
were
injured
and
over
forty
persons
lost
their
lives
although
the
boat
was
not
sunk
but
was
towed
to
boulogne
i
was
instructed
to
inquire
from
the
german
government
as
to
whether
a
german
submarine
had
sunk
the
the
foreign
office
finally
at
my
repeated
request
called
on
the
admiralty
for
a
report
of
the
torpedoing
of
the
and
finally
on
the
tenth
of
april
the
german
note
was
delivered
to
me
in
the
meantime
and
before
the
delivery
of
this
note
i
had
been
assured
again
and
again
that
the
had
not
been
torpedoed
by
a
german
submarine
in
this
note
a
rough
sketch
was
enclosed
said
to
have
been
made
by
the
officer
commanding
the
submarine
of
a
vessel
which
he
admitted
he
had
torpedoed
in
the
same
locality
where
the
had
been
attacked
and
at
about
the
same
time
of
day
it
was
said
that
this
boat
which
was
torpedoed
was
a
mine
layer
of
the
recently
built
class
and
that
a
great
explosion
which
was
observed
to
occur
in
the
torpedoed
ship
warranted
the
certain
conclusion
that
great
amounts
of
munitions
were
on
board
the
note
concluded
the
german
government
must
therefore
assume
that
injury
to
the
was
attributable
to
another
cause
than
attack
by
a
german
submarine
the
note
contained
an
offer
to
submit
any
difference
of
opinion
that
might
develop
to
be
investigated
by
a
mixed
commission
in
accordance
with
the
hague
convention
of
the
and
the
it
was
claimed
were
attacked
by
german
submarines
only
after
they
had
attempted
to
escape
and
an
explanation
was
given
as
to
the
with
reference
to
the
the
note
continued
should
the
american
government
have
at
its
disposal
other
material
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case
of
the
the
german
government
would
ask
that
it
be
communicated
in
order
to
subject
this
material
also
to
investigation
in
the
meantime
american
naval
officers
had
been
engaged
in
collecting
facts
as
to
the
sinking
of
the
and
this
evidence
which
seemed
overwhelming
and
in
connection
with
the
admissions
in
the
german
note
absolutely
conclusive
was
incorporated
in
the
note
sent
to
germany
in
which
germany
was
notified
unless
the
imperial
government
should
now
immediately
declare
and
effect
abandonment
of
this
present
method
of
submarine
warfare
against
passenger
and
freight
carrying
vessels
the
government
of
the
united
states
can
have
no
choice
but
to
sever
diplomatic
relations
with
the
german
empire
altogether
the
issue
was
now
clearly
defined
i
have
already
spoken
of
the
fact
that
for
a
long
time
there
had
been
growing
up
two
parties
in
germany
one
party
headed
by
von
tirpitz
in
favour
of
what
the
germans
called
or
ruthless
submarine
war
in
which
all
enemy
merchant
ships
were
to
be
sunk
without
warning
and
the
party
then
headed
by
the
chancellor
which
desired
to
avoid
a
conflict
with
america
on
this
issue
as
i
have
explained
in
a
former
chapter
the
military
have
always
claimed
to
take
a
hand
in
shaping
the
destinies
and
foreign
policies
of
germany
when
the
germans
began
to
turn
their
attention
to
the
creation
of
a
fleet
von
tirpitz
was
the
man
who
in
a
sense
became
the
leader
of
the
movement
and
therefore
the
creator
of
the
modern
navy
of
germany
a
skilful
politician
he
for
years
dominated
the
reichstag
and
on
the
question
of
submarine
warfare
was
most
efficiently
seconded
by
the
efforts
of
the
navy
league
an
organization
having
perhaps
one
million
members
throughout
germany
although
only
one
of
the
three
heads
of
the
navy
he
was
secretary
of
the
navy
by
the
force
of
his
personality
by
the
political
position
which
he
had
created
for
himself
and
by
the
backing
of
his
friends
in
the
navy
league
he
really
dominated
the
other
two
departments
of
the
navy
the
marine
staff
and
the
marine
cabinet
like
most
germans
of
the
ruling
class
ambition
is
his
only
passion
these
spartans
do
not
care
either
for
money
or
for
the
luxury
which
it
brings
their
life
is
on
very
simple
lines
both
in
the
army
and
navy
in
order
that
the
officers
shall
not
vie
with
one
another
in
expenditure
and
in
order
that
the
poorer
officers
and
their
wives
shall
not
be
subject
to
the
humiliation
which
would
be
caused
if
they
had
to
live
in
constant
contact
with
brother
officers
living
on
a
more
luxurious
footing
von
tirpitz
ambition
undoubtedly
led
him
to
consider
himself
as
a
promising
candidate
for
shoes
the
whole
submarine
issue
therefore
became
not
only
a
question
of
military
expediency
and
a
question
for
the
foreign
office
to
decide
in
connection
with
the
relations
of
america
to
germany
but
also
a
question
of
internal
politics
a
means
of
forcing
the
chancellor
out
of
office
the
advocates
for
the
ruthless
war
were
drawn
from
the
navy
and
from
the
army
and
those
who
believed
in
the
use
of
any
means
of
offence
against
their
enemies
and
particularly
in
the
use
of
any
means
that
would
stop
the
shipment
of
munitions
of
war
to
the
allies
the
army
and
the
navy
were
joined
by
the
conservatives
and
by
all
those
who
hoped
for
the
fall
of
the
chancellor
the
conservative
newspapers
and
even
the
roman
catholic
newspapers
were
violent
in
their
call
for
ruthless
submarine
war
as
well
as
violent
in
their
denunciations
of
the
united
states
of
america
american
passengers
on
merchant
ships
of
the
enemy
were
called
guardian
angels
and
caricatures
were
published
such
as
one
which
showed
the
mate
reporting
to
the
captain
of
an
english
boat
that
everything
was
in
readiness
for
sailing
and
the
captain
inquiry
are
you
sure
that
the
american
is
on
board
the
numerous
notes
sent
by
america
to
germany
also
formed
a
frequent
subject
of
caricature
and
i
remember
particularly
one
quite
clever
one
in
the
paper
called
representing
the
celebrations
in
a
german
port
on
the
arrival
of
the
one
hundredth
note
from
america
when
the
mayor
of
the
town
and
the
military
flower
girls
and
singing
societies
and
were
drawn
up
in
welcoming
array
the
liberal
papers
were
inclined
to
support
the
chancellor
in
his
apparent
intention
to
avoid
an
open
break
with
america
but
even
the
liberal
papers
were
not
very
strong
in
their
stand
the
military
of
course
absolutely
despised
america
and
claimed
that
america
could
do
no
more
harm
by
declaring
war
than
it
was
doing
then
to
germany
and
that
possibly
the
war
preparations
of
america
might
cut
down
the
amount
of
the
munitions
available
for
export
to
the
enemies
of
the
empire
as
to
anything
that
america
could
do
in
a
military
way
the
navy
and
the
army
were
unanimous
in
saying
that
as
a
military
or
naval
factor
the
united
states
might
be
considered
as
less
than
nothing
this
was
the
situation
when
the
last
note
of
america
brought
matters
to
a
crisis
and
even
the
crisis
itself
was
considered
a
farce
as
it
had
been
simmering
for
so
long
a
period
i
arranged
that
colonel
house
should
have
an
interview
with
the
chancellor
at
this
time
and
after
dinner
one
night
he
had
a
long
talk
with
the
chancellor
in
which
the
dangers
of
the
situation
were
pointed
out
with
this
arrival
of
the
last
american
note
i
felt
that
the
situation
was
almost
hopeless
that
this
question
which
had
dragged
along
for
so
long
must
now
inevitably
lead
to
a
break
of
relations
and
possibly
to
war
von
jagow
had
the
same
idea
and
said
that
it
was
fate
and
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
i
myself
felt
that
nothing
could
alter
public
opinion
in
germany
that
in
spite
of
von
tirpitz
fall
which
had
taken
place
some
time
before
the
advocates
of
ruthless
submarine
warfare
would
win
and
that
to
satisfy
them
germany
would
risk
a
break
with
america
i
was
sitting
in
my
office
in
a
rather
dazed
and
despairing
state
when
professor
ludwig
stein
proprietor
of
a
magazine
called
and
and
a
writer
of
special
articles
on
foreign
relations
for
the
under
the
name
of
diplomaticus
called
to
see
me
he
informed
me
that
he
thought
the
situation
was
not
yet
hopeless
that
there
was
still
a
large
party
of
reasonable
men
in
germany
and
that
he
thought
much
good
could
be
done
if
i
should
go
to
the
great
general
headquarters
and
have
a
talk
with
the
kaiser
who
he
informed
me
was
reported
to
be
against
a
break
i
told
stein
that
of
course
i
was
perfectly
willing
to
go
if
there
was
the
slightest
chance
of
preventing
war
and
i
also
told
the
chancellor
that
if
he
was
going
to
decide
this
question
in
favor
of
peace
it
would
be
possibly
easier
for
him
if
the
decision
was
arrived
at
under
the
protection
as
it
were
of
the
emperor
or
that
if
the
decision
lay
with
the
emperor
i
might
possibly
be
able
to
help
in
convincing
him
if
i
had
an
opportunity
to
lay
the
american
side
of
the
case
before
him
i
said
moreover
that
i
was
ready
at
any
time
on
short
notice
to
proceed
to
the
emperor
headquarters
hecksher
a
member
of
the
reichstag
who
must
be
classed
among
the
reasonable
men
of
germany
also
advocated
my
speaking
directly
to
the
kaiser
chapter
xiii
mainly
commercial
nothing
surprised
me
more
as
the
war
developed
than
the
discovery
of
the
great
variety
and
amount
of
goods
exported
from
germany
to
the
united
states
goods
sent
from
the
united
states
to
germany
are
mainly
prime
materials
approximately
one
hundred
and
sixty
million
dollars
a
year
of
cotton
million
dollars
of
copper
fifteen
millions
of
wheat
twenty
millions
of
animal
fats
ten
millions
of
mineral
oil
and
a
large
amount
of
vegetable
oil
of
course
the
amount
of
wheat
is
especially
variable
some
manufactured
goods
from
america
also
find
their
way
to
germany
to
the
extent
of
perhaps
seventy
millions
a
year
comprising
machinery
such
as
typewriters
and
a
miscellaneous
line
of
machinery
and
manufactures
the
principal
exports
from
germany
to
america
consist
of
dye
stuffs
and
chemical
dyes
toys
underwear
surgical
instruments
cutlery
stockings
knit
goods
and
a
raw
material
called
potash
also
known
as
kali
the
last
is
a
mineral
found
nowhere
in
the
world
except
in
germany
and
a
few
places
in
austria
potash
is
essential
to
the
manufacture
of
many
fertilizers
fertilizer
being
composed
as
a
rule
of
potash
phosphates
and
nitrates
the
nitrates
in
past
years
have
been
exported
to
all
countries
from
chile
phosphate
rock
is
mined
in
south
carolina
and
florida
and
several
other
places
in
the
world
curiously
enough
both
nitrates
and
potash
are
essential
ingredients
also
of
explosives
used
in
war
since
the
war
the
german
supply
from
chile
was
cut
off
but
the
germans
following
a
system
used
in
norway
for
many
years
before
the
war
established
great
electrical
plants
for
the
extraction
of
nitrates
from
the
atmosphere
since
the
war
american
agriculture
has
suffered
for
want
of
potash
and
german
agriculture
has
suffered
for
want
of
phosphates
possibly
of
nitrates
also
because
i
doubt
whether
sufficient
nitrogen
is
extracted
from
the
air
in
germany
to
provide
for
more
than
the
needs
of
the
explosive
industry
the
dyestuff
industry
had
been
developed
to
such
a
point
in
germany
that
germany
supplied
the
whole
world
in
the
first
months
of
the
war
some
enterprising
americans
headed
by
herman
metz
chartered
a
boat
called
and
sent
it
to
rotterdam
where
it
was
loaded
with
a
cargo
of
german
dyestuffs
the
boat
sailed
under
the
american
flag
and
was
not
interfered
with
by
the
english
later
on
the
german
department
of
the
interior
at
whose
head
was
delbrück
refused
to
allow
dyestuffs
to
leave
germany
except
in
exchange
for
cotton
and
finally
the
export
of
dyestuffs
from
germany
ceased
and
other
countries
were
compelled
to
take
up
the
question
of
manufacture
this
state
of
affairs
may
lead
to
the
establishment
of
the
industry
permanently
in
the
united
states
although
that
industry
will
require
protection
for
some
years
as
undoubtedly
germany
in
her
desperate
effort
to
regain
a
monopoly
of
this
trade
will
be
ready
to
spend
enormous
sums
in
order
to
undersell
the
american
manufacturers
and
drive
them
out
of
business
the
commercial
submarines
and
were
to
a
great
extent
built
with
money
furnished
by
the
dyestuff
manufacturers
who
hoped
that
by
sending
dyestuffs
in
this
way
to
america
they
could
prevent
the
development
of
the
industry
there
i
had
many
negotiations
with
the
foreign
office
with
reference
to
this
question
of
dyestuffs
the
export
of
toys
from
germany
to
the
united
states
forms
a
large
item
in
the
bill
which
we
pay
annually
to
germany
many
of
these
toys
are
manufactured
by
the
people
in
their
own
homes
in
the
picturesque
district
known
as
the
black
forest
of
course
the
war
cut
off
after
a
time
the
export
of
toys
from
germany
and
the
american
child
having
in
the
meantime
learned
to
be
satisfied
with
some
other
article
his
little
brother
will
demand
this
very
article
next
christmas
and
thus
after
the
war
germany
will
find
that
much
of
this
trade
has
been
permanently
lost
just
as
the
textile
trade
of
the
united
states
was
dependent
upon
the
german
dyestuffs
for
colours
so
the
sugar
beet
growers
of
america
were
dependent
upon
germany
for
their
seed
i
succeeded
with
the
able
assistance
of
the
consul
at
magdeburg
and
winslow
of
my
staff
in
getting
shipments
of
beet
seed
out
of
germany
i
have
heard
since
that
these
industries
too
are
being
developed
in
america
and
seed
obtained
from
other
countries
such
as
russia
another
commodity
upon
which
a
great
industry
in
the
united
states
and
mexico
depends
is
cyanide
the
discovery
of
the
cyanide
process
of
treating
gold
and
silver
ores
permitted
the
exploitation
of
many
mines
which
could
not
be
worked
under
the
older
methods
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
there
was
a
small
manufactory
of
cyanide
owned
by
germans
at
perth
amboy
and
niagara
falls
but
most
of
the
cyanide
used
was
imported
from
germany
the
american
german
company
and
the
companies
manufacturing
in
germany
and
in
england
all
operated
under
the
same
patents
the
english
and
german
companies
having
working
agreements
as
to
the
distribution
of
business
throughout
the
world
the
german
and
head
of
the
department
of
the
interior
delbrück
put
an
export
prohibition
on
cyanide
early
in
the
war
and
most
pigheadedly
and
obstinately
claimed
that
cyanide
was
manufactured
nowhere
but
in
germany
and
that
therefore
if
he
allowed
cyanide
to
leave
germany
for
the
united
states
or
mexico
the
english
would
capture
it
and
would
use
it
to
work
south
african
mines
thus
adding
to
the
stock
of
gold
and
power
in
war
of
the
british
empire
it
was
a
long
time
before
the
german
manufacturers
and
i
could
convince
this
gentleman
that
cyanide
sufficient
to
supply
all
the
british
mines
was
manufactured
near
glasgow
scotland
he
then
reluctantly
gave
a
permit
for
the
export
of
a
thousand
tons
of
cyanide
and
its
arrival
in
the
united
states
permitted
many
mines
there
and
in
mexico
to
continue
operations
and
saved
many
persons
from
being
thrown
out
of
employment
when
delbrück
finally
gave
a
permit
for
the
export
of
four
thousand
tons
more
of
cyanide
the
psychological
moment
had
passed
and
we
could
not
obtain
through
our
state
department
a
pass
from
the
british
i
am
convinced
that
delbrück
made
a
great
tactical
mistake
on
behalf
of
the
german
government
when
he
imposed
this
prohibition
against
export
of
goods
to
america
many
manufacturers
of
textiles
the
users
of
dyestuffs
medicines
seeds
and
chemicals
in
all
forms
were
clamouring
for
certain
goods
and
chemicals
from
germany
but
it
was
the
prohibition
against
export
by
the
germans
which
prevented
their
receiving
these
goods
if
it
had
been
the
british
blockade
alone
a
cry
might
have
arisen
in
the
united
states
against
this
blockade
which
might
have
materially
changed
the
international
situation
the
germans
also
refused
permission
for
the
export
of
potash
from
germany
they
hoped
thereby
to
induce
the
united
states
to
break
the
british
blockade
and
offered
cargoes
of
potash
in
exchange
for
cargoes
of
cotton
or
cargoes
of
foodstuffs
the
germans
claimed
that
potash
was
used
in
the
manufacture
of
munitions
and
that
therefore
in
no
event
would
they
permit
the
export
unless
the
potash
was
consigned
to
the
american
government
with
guarantees
against
its
use
except
in
the
manufacture
of
fertilizer
this
to
be
checked
up
by
germans
appointed
as
inspectors
all
these
negotiations
however
fell
through
and
no
potash
has
been
exported
from
germany
to
the
united
states
since
the
commencement
of
the
war
enough
potash
however
is
obtained
in
the
united
states
for
munition
purposes
from
the
burning
of
seaweed
on
the
pacific
coast
from
the
brines
in
a
lake
in
southern
california
and
from
a
rock
called
alunite
in
utah
potash
is
also
obtainable
from
feldspar
but
i
do
not
know
whether
any
plant
has
been
established
for
its
production
from
this
rock
i
recently
heard
of
the
arrival
of
some
potash
from
a
newly
discovered
field
in
brazil
and
there
have
been
rumours
of
its
discovery
in
spain
i
do
not
know
how
good
this
spanish
and
brazilian
potash
is
and
i
suppose
the
german
potash
syndicate
will
immediately
endeavour
to
control
these
fields
in
order
to
hold
the
potash
trade
of
the
world
in
its
grip
it
was
a
long
time
after
the
commencement
of
the
war
before
england
declared
cotton
a
contraband
i
think
this
was
because
of
the
fear
of
irritating
the
united
states
but
in
the
meantime
germany
secured
a
great
quantity
of
cotton
which
of
course
was
used
or
stored
for
the
manufacture
of
powder
since
the
cotton
imports
have
been
cut
off
the
germans
claim
that
they
are
manufacturing
a
powder
equally
good
by
using
wood
pulp
of
course
i
have
not
been
able
to
verify
this
absolutely
germany
had
endeavoured
before
the
war
in
every
way
to
keep
american
goods
out
of
the
german
markets
and
even
the
prussian
state
railways
are
used
as
i
have
shown
in
the
article
where
i
speak
of
the
attempt
to
establish
an
oil
monopoly
in
germany
in
order
to
discriminate
against
american
mineral
oils
this
same
method
has
been
applied
to
other
articles
such
as
wood
which
otherwise
might
be
imported
from
america
and
in
some
cases
regulations
as
to
the
inspection
of
meat
have
proved
more
effective
in
keeping
american
goods
out
of
the
market
than
a
prohibitive
tariff
the
meat
regulation
is
that
each
individual
package
of
meat
must
be
opened
and
inspected
and
of
course
when
a
sausage
has
been
individually
made
to
sit
up
and
bark
no
one
desires
it
as
an
article
of
food
thereafter
american
apples
were
also
discriminated
against
in
the
custom
regulations
of
germany
nor
could
i
induce
the
german
government
to
change
their
tariff
on
canned
salmon
an
article
which
would
prove
a
welcome
addition
to
the
german
diet
the
german
workingman
undoubtedly
the
most
exploited
and
fooled
workingman
in
the
world
is
compelled
not
only
to
work
for
low
wages
and
for
long
hours
but
to
purchase
his
food
at
rates
fixed
by
the
german
tariff
made
for
the
benefit
of
the
prussian
junkers
and
landowners
of
course
the
prussian
junkers
excuse
the
imposition
of
the
tariff
on
food
and
the
regulations
made
to
prevent
the
entry
of
foodstuffs
on
the
ground
that
german
agriculture
must
be
encouraged
first
in
order
to
enable
the
population
to
subsist
in
time
of
war
and
blockade
and
secondly
in
order
to
encourage
the
peasant
class
which
furnishes
the
most
solid
soldiers
to
the
imperial
armies
the
nations
and
business
men
of
the
world
will
have
to
face
after
the
war
a
new
condition
which
we
may
call
socialized
buying
and
socialized
selling
not
long
after
the
commencement
of
the
war
the
germans
placed
a
prohibitive
tariff
upon
the
import
of
certain
articles
of
luxury
such
as
perfumes
their
object
of
course
being
to
keep
the
german
people
from
sending
money
out
of
the
country
and
wasting
their
money
in
useless
expenditures
at
the
same
time
a
great
institution
was
formed
called
the
central
einkauf
gesellschaft
this
body
formed
under
government
auspices
of
men
appointed
from
civil
life
is
somewhat
similar
to
one
of
our
national
defence
boards
every
import
of
raw
material
into
germany
falls
into
the
hands
of
this
central
buying
company
and
if
a
german
desires
to
buy
any
raw
material
for
use
in
his
factory
he
must
buy
it
through
this
central
board
i
have
talked
with
members
of
this
board
and
they
all
unite
in
the
belief
that
this
system
will
be
continued
after
the
war
for
instance
if
a
man
in
germany
wishes
to
buy
an
automobile
or
a
pearl
necklace
or
a
case
of
perfumery
he
will
be
told
you
can
buy
this
if
you
can
buy
it
in
germany
but
if
you
have
to
send
to
america
for
the
automobile
if
you
have
to
send
to
paris
for
the
pearls
or
the
perfumery
you
can
not
buy
them
in
this
way
the
gold
supply
of
germany
will
be
husbanded
and
the
people
will
either
be
prevented
from
making
comparatively
useless
expenditures
or
compelled
to
spend
money
to
benefit
home
industry
on
the
other
hand
when
a
man
desires
to
buy
some
raw
material
for
example
copper
cotton
leather
wheat
or
something
of
that
kind
he
will
not
be
allowed
to
buy
abroad
on
his
own
hook
the
central
einkauf
gesellschaft
will
see
that
all
those
desiring
to
buy
cotton
or
copper
put
in
their
orders
on
or
before
a
certain
date
when
the
orders
are
all
in
the
quantities
called
for
will
be
added
up
by
this
central
board
and
then
one
man
representing
the
board
will
be
in
a
position
to
go
to
america
to
purchase
the
four
million
bales
of
cotton
or
two
hundred
million
pounds
of
copper
the
german
idea
is
that
this
one
board
will
be
able
to
force
the
sellers
abroad
to
compete
against
each
other
in
their
eagerness
to
sell
the
one
german
buyer
will
know
about
the
lowest
price
at
which
the
sellers
can
sell
their
product
by
the
buyer
standing
out
alone
with
this
great
order
the
germans
believe
that
the
sellers
one
by
one
will
fall
into
his
hands
and
sell
their
product
at
a
price
below
that
which
they
could
obtain
if
the
individual
sellers
of
america
were
meeting
the
individual
buyers
of
germany
in
the
open
market
when
the
total
amount
of
the
commodity
ordered
has
been
purchased
it
will
be
divided
up
among
the
german
buyers
who
put
in
their
orders
with
the
central
company
each
order
being
charged
with
its
proportionate
share
of
the
expenses
of
the
commission
and
possibly
an
additional
sum
for
the
benefit
of
the
treasury
of
the
empire
before
the
war
a
german
manufacturer
took
me
over
his
great
factory
where
fifteen
thousand
men
and
women
were
employed
showed
me
great
quantities
of
articles
made
from
copper
and
said
we
buy
this
copper
in
america
and
we
get
it
a
cent
and
a
half
a
pound
less
than
we
should
pay
for
it
because
our
government
permits
us
to
combine
for
the
purpose
of
buying
but
your
government
does
not
allow
your
people
to
combine
for
the
purpose
of
selling
you
have
got
lots
of
silly
people
who
become
envious
of
the
rich
and
pass
laws
to
prevent
combination
which
is
the
logical
development
of
all
industry
the
government
handling
of
exchange
during
the
war
was
another
example
of
the
use
of
the
centralised
power
of
the
government
for
the
benefit
of
the
whole
nation
in
the
first
year
of
the
war
when
i
desired
money
to
spend
in
germany
i
drew
a
check
on
my
bank
in
new
york
in
triplicate
and
sent
a
clerk
with
it
to
the
different
banks
in
berlin
to
obtain
bids
in
marks
selling
it
then
naturally
to
the
highest
bidder
but
soon
the
government
stepped
in
the
imperial
bank
was
to
fix
a
daily
rate
of
exchange
and
banks
and
individuals
were
forbidden
to
buy
or
sell
at
a
different
rate
that
this
fixed
rate
was
a
false
one
fixed
to
the
advantage
of
germany
i
proved
at
the
time
when
the
german
official
rate
was
marks
for
a
dollar
by
sending
my
american
checks
to
holland
buying
holland
money
with
them
and
german
money
with
the
holland
money
in
this
manner
obtaining
marks
for
each
dollar
and
just
before
leaving
germany
i
sold
a
lot
of
american
gold
to
a
german
bank
at
the
rate
of
marks
per
dollar
although
on
that
day
the
official
rate
was
and
although
the
buyer
of
the
gold
because
the
export
of
gold
was
forbidden
would
have
to
lose
interest
on
the
money
paid
me
or
on
the
gold
purchased
until
the
end
of
the
war
what
the
germans
thought
of
the
value
of
the
mark
is
shown
by
this
transaction
the
only
thing
that
can
maintain
a
fair
price
after
the
war
for
the
products
of
american
firms
miners
and
manufacturers
is
permission
to
combine
for
selling
abroad
there
is
before
congress
a
bill
called
the
webb
bill
permitting
those
engaged
in
export
trade
to
combine
and
this
bill
which
is
manifestly
for
the
benefit
of
the
american
producer
of
raw
materials
and
foods
and
manufactured
articles
should
be
passed
it
was
also
part
of
our
commercial
work
to
secure
permits
for
the
exportation
from
belgium
of
american
owned
goods
seized
by
germany
we
succeeded
in
a
number
of
cases
in
getting
these
goods
released
in
other
cases
the
american
owned
property
was
taken
over
by
the
government
but
the
american
owners
were
compensated
for
the
loss
germany
took
over
belligerent
property
and
put
it
in
the
hands
of
receivers
in
all
cases
where
the
majority
of
the
stock
of
a
german
corporation
was
owned
by
another
corporation
or
individuals
of
belligerent
nationality
the
german
corporation
was
placed
in
the
hands
of
a
receiver
the
german
government
however
would
not
allow
the
inquiry
into
the
stock
ownership
to
go
further
than
the
first
holding
corporation
there
were
many
cases
where
the
majority
of
the
stock
of
a
german
corporation
was
owned
by
an
english
corporation
and
the
majority
of
the
stock
of
the
english
corporation
in
turn
owned
by
an
american
corporation
or
by
americans
in
this
case
the
german
government
refused
to
consider
the
american
ownership
of
the
english
stock
and
put
the
german
company
under
government
control
with
the
low
wages
paid
to
very
efficient
workingmen
who
worked
for
long
hours
and
with
no
laws
against
combination
it
was
always
a
matter
of
surprise
to
me
that
the
germans
who
were
in
the
process
of
getting
all
the
money
in
the
world
should
have
allowed
their
military
autocracy
to
drive
them
into
war
i
am
afraid
that
after
this
war
if
we
expect
to
keep
a
place
for
our
trade
in
the
world
we
may
have
to
revise
some
of
our
ideas
as
to
trusts
and
the
sherman
law
trusts
or
combinations
are
not
only
permitted
but
even
encouraged
in
germany
they
are
known
there
as
cartels
and
the
difference
between
the
american
trust
and
the
german
cartel
is
that
the
american
trust
has
as
it
were
a
centralised
government
permanently
taking
over
and
combining
the
competing
elements
in
any
given
business
while
in
germany
the
competing
elements
form
a
combination
by
contract
for
a
limited
number
of
years
this
combination
is
called
a
cartel
and
during
these
years
each
member
of
the
cartel
is
assigned
a
given
amount
of
the
total
production
and
given
a
definite
share
of
the
profits
of
the
combination
the
german
cartel
therefore
as
consul
general
skinner
aptly
said
may
be
likened
to
a
confederation
existing
by
contract
for
a
limited
period
of
time
and
subject
to
renewal
only
at
the
will
of
its
members
it
may
be
that
competition
is
a
relic
of
barbarism
and
that
one
of
the
first
signs
of
a
higher
civilisation
is
an
effort
to
modify
the
stress
of
competition
the
debates
of
congress
tend
to
show
that
in
enacting
the
sherman
law
congress
did
not
intend
to
forbid
the
restraint
of
competition
among
those
in
the
same
business
but
only
intended
to
prohibit
the
forming
of
a
combination
by
those
who
combined
would
have
a
monopoly
of
a
particular
business
or
product
it
is
easy
to
see
why
all
the
coal
mines
in
the
country
should
be
prohibited
from
combining
but
it
is
not
easy
to
see
why
certain
people
engaged
in
the
tobacco
business
should
be
prohibited
from
taking
their
competitors
into
their
combination
because
tobacco
is
a
product
which
could
be
raised
upon
millions
of
acres
of
our
land
and
can
not
be
made
the
subject
of
a
monopoly
the
german
courts
have
expressly
said
that
if
prices
are
so
low
that
the
manufacturers
of
a
particular
article
see
financial
ruin
ahead
a
formation
of
a
cartel
by
them
must
be
looked
upon
as
a
justified
means
of
the
german
laws
are
directed
to
the
end
to
which
it
seems
to
be
such
laws
should
logically
be
directed
namely
to
the
prevention
of
unfair
competition
so
long
as
the
question
of
monopoly
is
not
involved
competition
can
always
be
looked
for
when
a
combination
is
making
too
great
profits
and
the
new
and
competing
corporation
and
individuals
should
be
protected
by
law
against
the
danger
of
price
cutting
for
the
express
purpose
of
driving
the
new
competitor
out
of
business
however
it
must
be
remembered
that
a
combination
acting
unfairly
in
competition
may
be
more
oppressive
than
a
monopoly
i
myself
am
not
convinced
by
the
arguments
of
either
side
it
is
a
matter
for
the
most
serious
study
the
object
of
the
american
trust
has
been
to
destroy
its
competitors
the
object
of
the
german
cartel
to
force
its
competitors
to
join
the
cartel
in
fact
the
government
in
germany
becomes
part
of
these
cartels
and
takes
an
active
hand
in
them
as
witness
the
participation
of
the
german
government
in
the
potash
syndicate
when
contracts
made
by
certain
american
buyers
with
german
mines
were
cancelled
and
all
the
potash
producing
mines
of
germany
and
austria
forced
into
one
confederation
and
witness
the
attempt
by
the
government
which
i
have
described
in
another
chapter
to
take
over
and
make
a
monopoly
of
the
wholesale
and
retail
oil
business
of
the
country
the
recent
closer
combination
of
dyestuff
industries
of
germany
with
the
express
purpose
of
meeting
and
destroying
american
competition
after
the
war
is
interesting
as
showing
german
methods
for
a
number
of
years
the
industry
of
germany
was
practically
controlled
by
six
great
companies
some
of
these
companies
employing
as
high
as
five
hundred
chemists
in
research
work
in
these
six
companies
made
an
agreement
looking
to
a
still
closer
alliance
not
only
for
the
distribution
of
the
product
but
also
for
the
distribution
of
ideas
and
trade
secrets
for
years
these
great
commercial
companies
supplied
all
the
countries
of
the
world
not
only
with
dyestuffs
and
other
chemical
products
but
also
with
medicines
discovered
by
their
chemists
and
made
from
coal
tar
which
although
really
nothing
more
than
patent
medicines
were
put
upon
the
market
as
new
and
great
and
beneficial
discoveries
in
medicine
the
badische
anilin
and
soda
fabrik
with
a
capital
of
million
marks
has
paid
dividends
in
the
ten
years
from
to
averaging
over
per
cent
the
farbwerke
meister
lucius
und
bruning
at
hoeckst
near
frankfort
during
the
same
period
with
a
capital
of
fifty
million
marks
has
paid
dividends
averaging
over
per
cent
and
the
chemical
works
of
bayer
and
company
near
cologne
during
the
same
period
with
a
capital
of
millions
of
marks
has
paid
dividends
averaging
over
thirty
per
cent
much
of
the
commercial
success
of
the
germans
during
the
last
forty
years
is
due
to
the
fact
that
each
manufacturer
each
discoverer
in
germany
each
exporter
knew
that
the
whole
weight
and
power
of
the
government
was
behind
him
in
his
efforts
to
increase
his
business
on
the
other
hand
in
america
business
men
have
been
terrorized
almost
into
inaction
by
constant
prosecutions
what
was
a
crime
in
one
part
of
the
united
states
under
one
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
a
perfectly
legitimate
act
in
another
if
we
have
to
meet
the
intense
competition
of
germany
after
the
war
we
have
got
to
view
all
these
problems
from
new
angles
for
instance
there
is
the
question
of
free
ports
representative
murray
hulbert
has
introduced
in
the
house
of
representatives
a
resolution
directing
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
secretary
of
war
and
the
secretary
of
commerce
to
report
to
congress
as
to
the
advisability
of
the
establishment
of
free
ports
within
the
limits
of
the
established
customs
of
the
united
states
free
ports
exist
in
germany
and
have
existed
for
a
long
time
although
germany
is
a
country
with
a
protective
tariff
in
a
free
port
raw
goods
are
manufactured
and
then
exported
of
course
to
the
advantage
of
the
country
permitting
the
establishment
of
free
ports
because
by
this
manufacture
of
raw
materials
and
their
without
being
subject
to
duty
money
is
earned
by
the
manufacturers
to
the
benefit
of
their
own
country
and
employment
is
given
to
many
workingmen
this
of
course
improves
the
condition
of
these
workingmen
and
of
all
others
in
the
country
as
it
is
that
the
employment
of
each
workingman
in
an
industry
which
would
not
exist
except
for
the
existence
of
the
free
port
withdraws
that
workingman
from
the
general
labour
market
and
therefore
benefits
the
position
of
his
remaining
fellow
labourers
although
free
ports
do
not
exist
in
the
united
states
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
give
certain
industries
by
means
of
what
are
known
as
drawbacks
the
same
benefit
that
they
would
enjoy
were
free
ports
existant
in
our
country
thus
the
refiners
of
raw
sugar
from
cuba
pay
a
duty
on
this
sugar
when
it
enters
the
united
states
but
receive
this
duty
back
when
a
corresponding
amount
of
refined
sugar
is
exported
to
other
countries
there
has
lately
been
an
attack
made
upon
this
system
in
the
case
however
of
the
sugar
refiners
only
and
the
question
has
been
treated
in
some
newspapers
as
if
these
refiners
were
obtaining
some
unfair
advantage
from
the
government
whereas
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
allowance
of
these
drawbacks
enables
the
sugar
refiners
to
carry
on
the
refining
of
the
sugar
for
export
much
as
they
would
if
their
refineries
existed
in
free
ports
modelled
on
the
german
system
the
repeal
of
the
provision
of
allowing
drawbacks
in
this
and
other
industries
will
probably
send
the
industries
to
canada
or
some
other
territory
where
this
system
equivalent
to
the
free
port
is
permitted
to
exist
a
few
days
before
i
left
germany
i
had
a
conversation
with
a
manufacturer
of
munitions
who
employs
about
eighteen
thousand
people
in
his
factories
which
before
the
war
manufactured
articles
other
than
munitions
i
asked
him
how
the
government
treated
the
manufacturers
of
munitions
and
he
said
that
they
were
allowed
to
make
good
profits
although
they
had
to
pay
out
a
great
proportion
of
these
profits
in
the
form
of
taxes
on
their
excess
or
war
profits
that
the
government
desired
to
encourage
manufacturers
to
turn
their
factories
into
factories
for
the
manufacture
of
all
articles
in
the
war
and
required
by
the
nation
in
sustaining
war
and
that
the
manufacturers
would
do
this
provided
that
it
were
only
a
question
as
to
how
much
of
their
profits
they
would
be
allowed
to
keep
but
that
if
the
government
had
attempted
to
fix
prices
so
low
that
there
would
have
been
a
doubt
as
to
whether
the
manufacturer
could
make
a
profit
or
not
the
production
of
articles
required
for
war
would
never
have
reached
the
high
mark
that
it
had
in
germany
as
a
matter
of
fact
about
the
only
tax
imposed
in
germany
since
the
outbreak
of
the
war
has
been
the
tax
upon
cost
or
war
profits
it
has
been
the
policy
of
germany
to
pay
for
the
war
by
great
loans
raised
by
popular
subscription
after
authorisation
by
the
reichstag
i
calculate
that
the
amounts
thus
raised
together
with
the
floating
indebtedness
amount
to
date
to
about
eighty
billions
of
marks
for
a
long
time
the
germans
expected
that
the
expenses
of
the
war
would
be
paid
from
the
indemnities
to
be
recovered
by
germany
from
the
nations
at
war
with
it
helfferich
shadowed
this
forth
in
his
speech
in
the
reichstag
on
august
when
he
said
if
we
wish
to
have
the
power
to
settle
the
terms
of
peace
according
to
our
interests
and
our
requirements
then
we
must
not
forget
the
question
of
cost
we
must
have
in
view
that
the
whole
future
activity
of
our
people
so
far
as
this
is
at
all
possible
shall
be
free
from
burdens
the
leaden
weight
of
billions
has
been
earned
by
the
instigators
of
this
war
and
in
the
future
they
rather
than
we
will
drag
it
about
after
them
of
course
by
instigators
of
the
war
helfferich
meant
the
opponents
of
germany
but
i
think
that
unconsciously
he
was
a
true
prophet
and
that
the
leaden
weight
of
the
billions
which
this
war
has
cost
germany
will
be
dragged
about
after
the
war
by
germany
the
real
instigator
of
this
world
calamity
in
december
helfferich
voiced
the
comfortable
plea
that
because
the
germans
were
spending
their
money
raised
by
the
war
loans
in
germany
the
weight
of
these
loans
was
not
a
real
weight
upon
the
german
people
he
said
we
are
paying
the
money
almost
exclusively
to
ourselves
while
the
enemy
is
paying
its
loans
abroad
a
guarantee
that
in
the
future
we
shall
maintain
the
advantage
this
belief
of
the
germans
and
helfferich
is
one
of
the
notable
fallacies
of
the
war
the
german
war
loans
have
been
subscribed
mainly
by
the
great
companies
of
germany
by
the
savings
banks
the
banks
the
life
and
fire
insurance
and
accident
insurance
companies
etc
furthermore
these
loans
have
been
pyramided
that
is
to
say
a
man
who
subscribed
and
paid
for
one
hundred
thousand
marks
of
loan
number
one
could
when
loan
number
two
was
called
for
take
the
bonds
he
had
bought
of
loan
number
one
to
his
bank
and
on
his
agreement
to
spend
the
proceeds
in
subscribing
to
loan
number
two
borrow
from
the
bank
eighty
thousand
marks
on
the
security
of
his
first
loan
bonds
and
so
on
there
is
an
annual
increment
not
easily
ascertainable
with
exactness
but
approximately
ascertainable
to
the
wealth
of
every
country
in
the
world
just
as
when
a
man
is
working
a
farm
there
is
in
normal
years
an
increment
or
accretion
of
wealth
or
income
to
him
above
the
cost
of
the
production
of
the
products
of
the
soil
which
he
sells
there
is
such
an
annual
increment
to
the
wealth
of
each
country
taken
as
a
whole
some
experts
have
told
me
they
calculated
that
at
the
outside
in
prosperous
peace
times
the
annual
increment
of
german
wealth
is
ten
billion
marks
now
when
we
have
the
annual
interest
to
be
paid
by
germany
exceeding
the
annual
increment
of
the
country
the
social
and
even
moral
bankruptcy
of
the
country
must
ensue
if
repudiation
of
the
loan
or
any
part
of
it
is
then
forced
the
loss
naturally
falls
upon
those
who
have
taken
the
loan
the
or
small
capitalist
who
put
all
his
savings
in
the
war
loan
is
without
support
for
his
old
age
and
so
with
the
man
who
took
insurance
in
the
insurance
companies
or
put
his
savings
in
a
bank
if
that
bank
becomes
bankrupt
through
repudiation
of
the
war
loan
you
then
have
the
country
in
a
position
where
the
are
all
working
to
pay
what
they
can
towards
the
interest
of
the
government
loan
after
earning
enough
to
keep
themselves
and
their
families
alive
and
the
old
and
the
young
without
support
and
deprived
of
their
savings
become
mere
burdens
on
the
community
already
the
mere
interest
of
the
war
loan
of
germany
amounts
to
four
billions
of
marks
a
year
to
this
must
be
added
of
course
the
interest
of
the
previous
indebtedness
of
the
country
and
of
each
political
subdivision
thereof
including
cities
all
of
which
have
added
to
their
debt
by
incurring
great
debts
to
help
the
destitute
in
this
war
and
of
course
to
all
this
must
be
added
the
expenses
of
the
administration
of
the
government
and
the
maintenance
of
the
army
and
navy
it
is
the
contemplation
of
this
state
of
affairs
when
he
is
convinced
that
indemnities
are
not
to
be
exacted
from
other
countries
that
will
do
most
to
persuade
the
average
intelligent
german
business
man
that
peace
must
be
had
at
any
cost
chapter
xiv
work
for
the
germans
the
interests
of
germany
in
france
england
and
russia
were
placed
with
our
american
ambassadors
in
these
countries
this
of
course
entailed
much
work
upon
our
embassy
because
we
were
the
medium
of
communication
between
the
german
government
and
these
ambassadors
i
found
it
necessary
to
establish
a
special
department
to
look
after
these
matters
at
its
head
was
barclay
rives
who
had
been
for
many
years
in
our
diplomatic
service
and
who
joined
my
embassy
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
first
secretary
of
our
embassy
in
vienna
for
ten
or
twelve
years
he
spoke
german
perfectly
and
was
acquainted
with
many
germans
and
austrians
inquiries
about
germans
who
were
prisoners
negotiations
relative
to
the
treatment
of
german
prisoners
and
so
on
came
under
this
department
one
example
will
show
the
nature
of
this
work
when
the
germans
invaded
france
a
german
cavalry
patrol
with
two
officers
von
schierstaedt
and
count
schwerin
and
several
men
penetrated
as
far
as
the
forest
of
fontainebleau
south
of
paris
there
they
got
out
of
touch
with
the
german
forces
and
wandered
about
for
days
in
the
forest
in
the
course
of
their
wanderings
they
requisitioned
some
food
from
the
inhabitants
and
took
i
believe
an
old
coat
for
one
of
the
officers
who
had
lost
his
and
requisitioned
a
wagon
to
carry
a
wounded
man
after
their
surrender
to
the
french
the
two
officers
were
tried
by
a
french
court
martial
charged
with
pillaging
and
sentenced
to
be
degraded
from
their
rank
and
transported
to
cayenne
the
devil
island
of
the
dreyfus
case
the
germans
made
strong
representations
and
our
very
skilled
ambassador
in
paris
the
honourable
william
sharp
took
up
the
matter
with
the
foreign
office
and
succeeded
in
preventing
the
transportation
of
the
officers
the
sending
of
the
officers
and
men
however
into
a
military
prison
where
they
were
treated
as
convicts
caused
great
indignation
throughout
germany
the
officers
had
many
and
powerful
connections
in
their
own
country
who
took
up
their
cause
there
were
bitter
articles
in
the
german
press
and
caricatures
and
cartoons
were
published
i
sent
rives
to
paris
and
told
him
not
to
leave
until
he
had
seen
these
officers
he
remained
in
paris
some
weeks
and
finally
through
sharp
obtained
permission
to
visit
the
officers
in
the
military
prison
later
the
french
showed
a
tendency
to
be
lenient
in
this
case
but
it
was
hard
to
find
a
way
for
the
french
government
to
back
down
gracefully
schierstaedt
having
become
insane
in
the
meantime
a
very
clever
way
out
of
the
difficulty
was
suggested
i
believe
by
sharp
schierstaedt
having
been
found
to
be
insane
was
presumably
insane
at
the
time
of
the
patrol
wandering
in
the
forest
of
fontainebleau
as
he
was
the
senior
officer
the
other
officer
and
the
men
under
him
were
not
responsible
for
obeying
his
commands
the
result
was
that
schwerin
and
the
men
of
the
patrol
were
put
in
a
regular
prison
camp
and
schierstaedt
was
very
kindly
sent
by
the
french
back
to
germany
where
he
recovered
his
reason
sufficiently
to
be
able
to
come
and
thank
me
for
the
efforts
made
on
his
behalf
i
made
every
endeavour
so
far
as
it
lay
in
my
power
to
oblige
the
germans
we
helped
them
in
the
exchange
of
prisoners
and
the
care
of
german
property
in
enemy
countries
there
were
rumours
in
berlin
that
germans
taken
as
prisoners
in
german
african
colonies
were
forced
to
work
in
the
sun
watched
and
beaten
by
coloured
guards
this
was
taken
up
by
one
of
the
grand
dukes
of
mecklenburg
who
had
been
governor
of
togoland
and
who
also
took
great
interest
in
sending
clothes
to
these
prisoners
germany
demanded
that
the
prisoners
in
africa
be
sent
to
a
more
temperate
climate
another
royalty
who
was
busied
with
prisoners
affairs
was
prince
max
of
baden
he
is
heir
to
the
throne
of
baden
although
not
a
son
of
the
reigning
duke
he
is
very
popular
and
for
my
part
i
admire
him
greatly
he
travels
with
emerson
essays
in
his
pocket
and
keeps
up
with
the
thought
and
progress
of
all
countries
baden
will
be
indeed
happy
in
having
such
a
ruler
prince
max
was
a
man
so
reasonable
so
human
that
i
understand
that
von
jagow
was
in
favour
of
putting
him
at
the
head
of
a
central
department
for
prisoners
of
war
i
agreed
with
von
jagow
that
in
such
case
all
would
go
smoothly
and
humanely
naturally
von
jagow
could
only
mildly
hint
at
the
desirability
of
this
appointment
a
prince
heir
to
one
of
the
thrones
of
germany
with
the
rank
of
general
in
the
army
he
seemed
ideally
fitted
for
such
a
position
but
unfortunately
the
opposition
of
the
army
and
particularly
of
the
representative
corps
commanders
was
so
great
that
von
jagow
told
me
the
plan
was
impossible
of
realisation
i
am
sure
if
prince
max
had
been
at
the
head
of
such
a
department
germany
would
not
now
be
suffering
from
the
odium
of
mistreating
its
prisoners
and
that
the
two
million
prisoners
of
war
in
germany
would
not
return
to
their
homes
imbued
with
an
undying
hate
prince
max
was
very
helpful
in
connection
with
the
american
mission
to
russia
for
german
prisoners
which
i
had
organised
and
which
i
have
described
in
the
chapter
on
war
charities
all
complaints
made
by
the
imperial
government
with
reference
to
the
treatment
of
german
prisoners
and
so
forth
in
enemy
countries
were
first
given
to
me
and
transmitted
by
our
embassy
to
the
american
ambassadors
having
charge
of
german
interests
in
enemy
countries
all
this
with
the
correspondence
ensuing
made
a
great
amount
of
clerical
work
i
think
that
every
day
i
received
one
or
more
germans
who
were
anxious
about
prisoner
friends
making
inquiries
and
wishing
to
consult
me
on
business
matters
in
the
united
states
etc
all
of
these
people
showed
gratitude
for
what
we
were
able
to
do
for
them
but
their
gratitude
was
only
a
drop
in
the
ocean
of
officially
inspired
hatred
of
america
chapter
xv
war
charities
as
soon
as
the
war
was
declared
and
millions
of
men
marched
forward
intent
upon
killing
hundreds
of
men
and
women
immediately
took
up
the
problem
of
helping
the
soldiers
the
wounded
and
the
prisoners
and
of
caring
for
those
left
behind
by
the
men
who
had
gone
to
the
front
the
first
war
charity
to
come
under
my
observation
was
the
american
red
cross
two
units
containing
three
doctors
and
about
twelve
nurses
each
were
sent
to
germany
by
the
american
national
red
cross
before
their
arrival
i
took
up
with
the
german
authorities
the
questions
as
to
whether
these
would
be
accepted
and
where
they
would
be
placed
the
german
authorities
accepted
the
units
and
at
first
decided
to
send
one
to
each
front
the
young
man
assigned
to
the
west
front
was
goldschmidt
rothschild
one
of
the
last
descendants
of
the
great
frankfort
family
of
rothschild
he
had
been
attached
to
the
german
embassy
in
london
before
the
war
the
one
assigned
to
the
unit
for
the
east
front
was
count
hélie
de
talleyrand
both
of
these
young
men
spoke
english
perfectly
and
were
chosen
for
that
reason
and
both
have
many
friends
in
england
and
america
talleyrand
was
of
a
branch
of
the
celebrated
talleyrand
family
and
possessed
german
citizenship
during
the
napoleonic
era
the
great
talleyrand
married
one
of
his
nephews
to
a
princess
of
courland
who
with
her
sister
was
joint
heiress
of
the
principality
of
sagan
in
germany
the
share
of
the
other
sister
was
bought
by
the
sister
who
married
young
talleyrand
and
the
descendants
of
that
union
became
princes
of
sagan
and
held
the
italian
title
of
duke
de
dino
and
the
french
title
of
duke
de
valençay
some
of
the
descendants
of
this
nephew
of
the
great
talleyrand
remained
in
germany
and
this
young
talleyrand
assigned
to
the
red
cross
unit
belonged
to
that
branch
others
settled
in
france
and
among
these
was
the
last
holder
of
the
title
and
the
duke
de
dino
who
married
successively
two
americans
miss
curtis
and
sampson
it
was
a
custom
in
this
family
that
the
holder
of
the
principal
title
that
of
the
prince
of
sagan
allowed
the
next
two
members
in
succession
to
bear
the
titles
of
duke
de
dino
and
duke
de
valençay
before
the
last
prince
of
sagan
died
in
france
his
son
hélie
married
the
american
anna
gould
who
had
divorced
the
count
castellane
on
the
death
of
his
father
and
in
accordance
with
the
statutes
of
the
house
of
sagan
the
members
of
the
family
who
were
german
citizens
held
a
family
council
and
with
the
approval
of
the
emperor
of
germany
passed
over
the
succession
from
anna
gould
husband
to
her
son
so
that
her
son
has
now
the
right
to
the
title
and
not
his
father
but
the
son
must
become
a
german
citizen
at
his
majority
the
younger
brother
of
the
husband
of
anna
gould
bears
the
title
of
duke
de
valençay
and
is
the
divorced
husband
of
the
daughter
of
levi
morton
formerly
of
the
united
states
this
young
talleyrand
to
whom
i
have
referred
and
who
was
assigned
to
the
american
red
cross
unit
although
he
was
a
german
by
nationality
did
not
wish
to
fight
in
this
war
against
france
in
which
country
he
had
so
many
friends
and
relations
and
therefore
this
assignment
to
the
american
red
cross
was
most
welcome
to
him
on
the
arrival
of
the
american
doctors
and
nurses
in
berlin
it
was
decided
to
send
both
units
to
the
east
front
and
to
put
one
in
the
small
silesian
town
of
gleiwitz
and
the
other
in
the
neighbouring
town
of
kosel
count
talleyrand
went
with
these
two
units
goldschmidt
rothschild
being
attached
to
the
prussian
legation
in
munich
we
had
a
reception
in
the
embassy
for
these
doctors
and
nurses
which
was
attended
by
prince
hatzfeld
duke
of
trachenberg
who
was
head
of
the
german
red
cross
and
other
germans
interested
in
this
line
of
work
the
gleiwitz
and
kosel
units
remained
in
these
towns
for
about
a
year
until
the
american
red
cross
withdrew
its
units
from
europe
at
about
the
time
of
the
withdrawal
of
these
units
i
had
heard
much
of
the
sufferings
of
german
prisoners
in
russia
i
had
many
conversations
with
zimmermann
of
the
german
foreign
office
and
prince
hatzfeld
on
this
question
as
well
as
with
prince
max
of
baden
the
heir
presumptive
to
the
throne
of
that
country
and
i
finally
arranged
that
such
of
these
american
doctors
and
nurses
as
volunteered
should
be
sent
to
russia
to
do
what
they
could
for
the
german
prisoners
of
war
there
nine
doctors
and
nurses
volunteered
they
were
given
a
great
reception
in
berlin
the
german
authorities
placed
a
large
credit
in
the
hands
of
this
mission
and
after
i
had
obtained
through
our
state
department
the
consent
of
the
russian
government
for
the
admission
of
the
mission
it
started
from
berlin
for
petrograd
the
german
authorities
and
the
germans
as
a
whole
were
very
much
pleased
with
this
arrangement
officers
of
the
prussian
army
were
present
at
the
departure
of
the
trains
and
gave
flowers
to
all
the
nurses
it
is
very
unfortunate
that
after
their
arrival
in
russia
this
mission
was
hampered
in
every
way
and
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
obtaining
permission
to
do
any
work
at
all
many
of
them
however
managed
to
get
in
positions
where
they
assisted
the
german
prisoners
for
instance
in
one
town
where
there
were
about
five
thousand
germans
who
had
been
sent
there
to
live
one
of
our
doctors
managed
to
get
appointed
as
city
physician
and
aided
by
several
of
the
american
nurses
was
able
to
do
a
great
work
for
the
german
population
others
of
our
nurses
managed
to
get
as
far
as
tomsk
in
siberia
and
others
were
scattered
through
the
russian
empire
had
this
mission
under
snoddy
been
able
to
carry
out
its
work
as
originally
planned
it
would
not
only
have
done
much
good
to
the
german
prisoners
of
war
but
would
have
helped
a
great
deal
to
do
away
with
the
bitter
feeling
entertained
by
germans
towards
americans
even
with
the
limited
opportunity
given
this
mission
it
undoubtedly
materially
helped
the
prisoners
on
arriving
in
berlin
on
their
way
home
to
america
from
gleiwitz
and
kosel
the
doctors
and
nurses
of
these
american
units
were
all
awarded
the
german
red
cross
order
of
the
second
class
and
those
who
had
been
in
austria
were
similarly
decorated
by
the
government
among
those
who
devoted
themselves
to
works
of
charity
during
this
war
no
one
stands
higher
than
herbert
hoover
i
can
not
find
words
to
express
my
admiration
for
this
man
whose
great
talents
for
organisation
were
placed
at
the
service
of
humanity
every
one
knows
of
what
he
accomplished
in
feeding
the
inhabitants
of
belgium
and
northern
france
hoover
asked
me
to
become
one
of
the
chairmen
of
the
international
commission
for
the
relief
of
belgium
and
i
was
happy
to
have
the
opportunity
in
berlin
to
second
his
efforts
there
was
considerable
business
in
connection
with
the
work
of
the
commission
i
had
many
interviews
with
those
in
authority
with
reference
to
getting
their
ships
through
etc
hoover
and
i
called
on
the
chancellor
and
endeavoured
to
get
him
to
remit
the
fine
of
forty
million
francs
a
month
which
the
germans
had
imposed
upon
belgium
this
however
the
chancellor
refused
to
do
later
on
in
april
i
was
able
as
an
to
see
how
efficiently
organisation
fed
in
addition
to
the
people
of
belgium
the
french
population
in
that
part
of
northern
france
in
the
occupation
of
the
germans
hoover
surrounded
himself
with
an
able
staff
vernon
kellogg
and
others
and
in
america
men
like
hemphill
were
his
devoted
supporters
early
in
ernest
bicknell
who
had
first
come
to
germany
representing
the
american
red
cross
returned
representing
not
only
that
organisation
but
also
the
rockefeller
foundation
with
him
was
wickliffe
rose
also
of
the
rockefeller
foundation
and
with
these
two
gentlemen
i
took
up
the
question
of
the
relief
of
poland
rose
and
bicknell
together
visited
poland
and
saw
with
their
own
eyes
the
necessity
for
relief
a
meeting
was
held
in
the
reichstag
attended
by
prince
hatzfeld
of
the
german
red
cross
director
guttmann
of
the
dresdener
bank
geheimrat
lewald
of
the
imperial
ministry
of
the
interior
representing
the
german
government
and
many
others
connected
with
the
government
military
and
financial
interests
of
germany
the
commission
for
the
relief
in
poland
of
which
i
was
to
be
chairman
was
organised
and
included
the
spanish
ambassador
his
excellency
the
bishop
of
posen
the
prince
bishop
of
cracow
jacob
schiff
of
new
york
and
others
warwick
greene
and
wadsworth
were
to
take
up
the
actual
executive
work
in
conjunction
with
rose
and
bicknell
i
drew
up
a
sort
of
treaty
having
particularly
in
mind
certain
difficulties
encountered
by
the
american
relief
commission
in
belgium
the
main
point
in
this
treaty
was
that
the
german
government
agreed
not
to
requisition
either
food
or
money
within
the
limits
of
the
territory
to
be
relieved
which
territory
comprised
that
part
of
poland
within
german
occupation
up
to
within
as
i
recall
it
fifty
kilometres
of
the
firing
line
the
one
exception
was
that
a
fine
might
be
levied
on
a
community
where
all
the
inhabitants
had
made
themselves
jointly
and
severally
liable
according
to
the
provisions
of
the
hague
convention
the
rockefeller
foundation
on
its
part
agreed
to
pay
all
the
expenses
of
the
executive
work
of
the
commission
this
treaty
after
being
submitted
to
general
hindenburg
and
approved
by
him
was
signed
by
lewald
representing
the
german
government
by
bicknell
representing
the
rockefeller
foundation
and
by
me
representing
the
new
commission
for
the
relief
of
poland
work
was
immediately
commenced
under
this
arrangement
and
so
far
as
possible
food
was
purchased
in
holland
and
denmark
but
there
was
little
to
be
had
in
these
countries
the
allies
however
refused
to
allow
food
to
enter
germany
for
the
purpose
of
this
commission
and
so
the
matter
fell
through
later
when
the
allies
were
willing
to
permit
the
food
to
enter
it
was
the
german
government
that
refused
to
reaffirm
this
treaty
and
refused
to
agree
that
the
german
army
of
occupation
should
not
requisition
food
in
occupied
poland
of
course
under
these
circumstances
no
one
could
expect
the
allies
to
consent
to
the
entry
of
food
because
the
obvious
result
would
be
that
the
germans
would
immediately
following
the
precedent
established
by
them
in
northern
france
take
all
the
food
produced
in
the
country
for
their
army
and
the
civil
population
of
germany
and
allow
the
poles
to
be
fed
with
food
sent
in
from
outside
while
perhaps
their
labour
was
utilised
in
the
very
fields
the
products
of
which
were
destined
for
german
consumption
there
is
no
question
that
the
sufferings
of
the
people
of
poland
have
been
very
great
and
when
the
history
of
poland
during
the
war
comes
to
be
written
the
world
will
stand
aghast
at
the
story
of
her
sufferings
it
is
a
great
pity
that
these
various
schemes
for
relief
did
not
succeed
the
rockefeller
commission
however
up
to
the
time
i
left
germany
did
continue
to
carryon
some
measure
of
relief
and
succeeded
in
getting
in
condensed
milk
to
some
extent
for
the
children
of
that
unfortunate
country
these
negotiations
brought
me
in
contact
with
a
number
of
poles
resident
in
berlin
whom
i
found
most
eager
to
do
what
they
could
to
relieve
the
situation
i
wish
here
to
express
my
admiration
for
the
work
of
the
rockefeller
commission
in
europe
not
only
were
the
ideas
of
the
commission
excellent
and
businesslike
but
the
men
selected
to
carry
them
into
effect
were
without
exception
men
of
high
character
and
possessed
of
rare
executive
ability
as
i
have
said
in
a
previous
chapter
i
was
ridiculed
in
the
american
newspapers
because
i
had
suggested
in
answer
to
a
cable
of
the
league
of
mercy
that
some
work
should
be
done
for
the
prisoners
of
war
i
do
not
know
whether
the
great
work
undertaken
by
john
mott
and
his
associates
was
suggested
by
my
answer
or
not
that
does
not
matter
but
this
work
undertaken
by
the
american
certainly
mattered
a
great
deal
to
the
prisoners
of
war
in
europe
mott
after
serving
on
the
mexican
commission
has
gone
to
russia
as
a
member
of
the
commission
to
that
country
the
organisation
headed
by
mott
who
was
most
ably
assisted
by
the
reverend
archibald
harte
took
up
this
work
which
was
financed
i
have
been
told
by
the
mccormick
family
of
chicago
cleveland
dodge
john
rockefeller
and
others
harte
obtained
permission
from
the
german
authorities
for
the
erection
of
meeting
halls
and
for
work
in
german
camps
when
he
had
obtained
this
authorisation
from
germany
he
went
to
russia
where
he
was
able
to
get
a
similar
authorisation
at
first
in
russia
i
have
heard
the
prisoners
of
war
were
allowed
great
liberty
and
lived
unguarded
in
siberian
villages
where
they
obtained
milk
bread
butter
eggs
and
honey
at
very
reasonable
rates
as
the
war
went
on
they
were
more
and
more
confined
to
barracks
and
there
their
situation
was
sad
indeed
in
the
winter
season
it
is
dark
at
three
in
the
afternoon
and
remains
dark
until
ten
the
following
morning
of
course
i
did
not
see
the
russian
prison
camps
the
work
carried
on
there
was
similar
to
that
carried
on
in
the
german
camps
by
harte
and
his
band
of
devoted
assistants
i
was
particularly
interested
in
this
work
because
i
hoped
that
the
aid
given
to
the
german
prisoners
of
war
in
russia
would
help
to
do
away
with
the
great
hate
and
prejudice
against
americans
in
germany
so
i
did
all
i
could
not
only
to
forward
work
but
to
suggest
and
organise
the
sending
of
the
expedition
of
nurses
and
doctors
which
i
have
already
described
to
the
russian
camps
of
course
harte
in
this
work
did
not
attempt
to
cover
all
the
prison
camps
in
germany
he
did
much
to
help
the
mental
and
physical
conditions
of
the
prisoners
in
ruhleben
the
english
civilian
camp
near
berlin
the
american
built
a
great
hall
where
religious
exercises
were
held
plays
and
lectures
given
and
where
prisoners
had
a
good
place
to
read
and
write
in
during
the
day
a
library
was
established
in
this
building
the
work
carried
on
by
the
may
be
briefly
described
as
coming
under
the
following
heads
religious
activities
educational
activities
work
shops
and
gardens
physical
exercises
and
sports
diet
kitchens
for
convalescents
libraries
and
music
including
orchestra
choruses
and
so
on
when
i
left
germany
on
the
breaking
of
diplomatic
relations
a
number
of
these
workers
left
with
me
the
german
women
exhibited
notable
qualities
in
war
they
engaged
in
the
red
cross
work
including
the
preparation
of
supplies
and
bandages
for
the
hospitals
and
the
first
day
of
mobilisation
saw
a
number
of
young
girls
at
every
railway
station
in
the
country
with
food
and
drink
for
the
passing
soldiers
at
railway
junctions
and
terminals
in
the
large
cities
stations
were
established
where
these
red
cross
workers
gave
a
warm
meal
to
the
soldiers
passing
through
in
these
terminal
stations
there
were
also
women
workers
possessed
of
sufficient
skill
to
change
the
dressings
of
the
lightly
wounded
on
the
bellevuestrasse
frau
von
ihne
wife
of
the
great
architect
founded
a
home
for
blinded
soldiers
in
this
home
soldiers
were
taught
to
make
brooms
brushes
baskets
etc
german
women
who
had
country
places
turned
these
into
homes
for
the
convalescent
wounded
but
perhaps
the
most
noteworthy
was
the
national
frauendienst
or
service
for
women
organised
the
first
day
of
the
war
the
relief
given
by
the
state
to
the
wives
and
children
of
soldiers
was
distributed
from
stations
in
berlin
and
in
the
neighbourhood
of
each
of
these
stations
the
frauendienst
established
an
office
where
women
were
always
in
attendance
ready
to
give
help
and
advice
to
the
soldiers
wives
there
there
were
of
all
the
people
within
the
district
and
of
their
needs
at
the
time
i
left
germany
i
believe
that
there
were
upwards
of
seven
thousand
women
engaged
in
berlin
in
social
service
in
instructing
the
women
in
the
new
art
of
cooking
without
milk
eggs
or
fat
and
seeing
to
it
that
the
children
had
their
fair
share
of
milk
it
is
due
to
the
efforts
of
these
social
workers
that
the
rate
of
infant
mortality
in
berlin
decreased
during
the
war
a
war
always
causes
a
great
unsettling
in
business
and
trade
people
no
longer
buy
as
many
articles
of
luxury
and
the
workers
engaged
in
the
production
of
these
articles
are
thrown
out
of
employment
in
germany
the
national
women
service
acting
with
the
labour
exchanges
did
its
best
to
find
new
positions
for
those
thrown
out
of
work
women
were
helped
over
a
period
of
poverty
until
they
could
find
new
places
and
were
instructed
in
new
trades
many
women
engaged
in
the
work
of
sending
packages
containing
food
and
comforts
to
the
soldiers
at
the
front
and
to
the
german
prisoners
of
war
in
other
countries
through
the
efforts
of
the
american
association
of
commerce
and
trade
and
the
embassy
a
free
restaurant
was
established
in
berlin
in
one
of
the
poorer
districts
about
two
hundred
people
were
fed
here
daily
in
a
hall
decorated
with
flags
and
plants
this
was
continued
even
after
we
left
germany
at
christmas
gerard
and
i
visited
this
kitchen
with
and
wolf
and
general
von
kessel
commander
of
the
mark
of
brandenburg
and
one
of
his
daughters
presents
were
distributed
to
the
children
and
the
mothers
received
an
order
for
goods
in
one
of
the
department
stores
the
german
christmas
songs
were
sung
and
when
a
little
german
child
offered
a
prayer
for
peace
i
do
not
think
there
was
any
one
present
who
could
refrain
from
weeping
many
of
the
german
women
of
title
princesses
established
base
hospitals
of
their
own
and
seemed
to
manage
these
hospitals
with
success
chapter
xvi
hate
on
my
way
from
berlin
to
america
in
february
at
a
dinner
in
paris
i
met
the
celebrated
italian
historian
ferrero
in
a
conversation
with
him
after
dinner
i
reminded
him
of
the
fact
that
both
he
and
a
frenchman
named
huret
who
had
written
on
america
had
stated
in
their
books
that
the
thing
which
struck
them
most
in
the
study
of
the
american
people
was
the
absence
of
hate
ferrero
recalled
this
and
in
the
discussion
which
followed
and
in
which
the
french
novelist
marcel
prevost
took
part
all
agreed
that
there
was
more
hate
in
europe
than
in
america
first
because
the
peoples
of
europe
were
confined
in
small
space
and
secondly
because
the
european
whatever
his
rank
or
station
lacked
the
opportunities
for
advancement
and
consequently
the
eagerness
to
press
on
ahead
and
that
fixing
of
the
thought
on
the
future
instead
of
the
past
which
formed
part
of
the
american
character
in
a
few
hours
in
europe
it
is
possible
to
travel
in
an
automobile
across
countries
where
the
people
differ
violently
from
the
countries
surrounding
them
not
only
in
language
customs
and
costumes
but
also
in
methods
of
thought
and
physical
appearance
the
day
i
left
berlin
i
went
to
see
herr
von
gwinner
head
of
the
deutsche
bank
with
reference
to
a
charitable
fund
which
had
been
collected
for
widows
and
orphans
in
germany
in
our
talk
von
gwinner
said
that
europeans
envied
america
because
we
seemed
to
be
able
to
assimilate
all
those
people
who
as
soon
as
they
landed
on
our
shores
sought
to
forget
their
old
race
hatreds
and
endeavoured
as
speedily
as
possible
to
adopt
american
clothes
language
and
thought
i
told
him
i
thought
it
was
because
in
our
country
we
did
not
try
to
force
anyone
that
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
a
pole
speaking
polish
and
wearing
polish
dress
if
he
chose
that
the
only
weapon
we
used
against
those
who
desired
to
uphold
the
customs
of
europe
was
that
of
ridicule
and
that
it
was
the
repressive
measures
such
as
for
example
the
repressive
action
taken
by
prussia
against
the
poles
and
the
danes
the
alsatians
and
the
lorrainers
that
had
aroused
a
combative
instinct
in
these
peoples
and
made
them
cling
to
every
vestige
of
their
former
nationality
at
first
with
the
coming
of
war
the
concentrated
hate
of
the
german
people
seemed
to
be
turned
upon
the
russians
even
liebknecht
when
he
called
upon
me
in
order
to
show
that
he
had
not
been
shot
as
reported
in
america
spoke
of
the
perils
of
czarismus
and
the
hatred
of
the
german
people
for
the
russians
but
later
and
directed
by
the
master
hand
of
the
governing
class
all
the
hatred
of
the
germans
was
concentrated
upon
england
the
cartoon
in
representing
a
prussian
family
having
its
morning
hate
was
in
some
aspects
not
at
all
exaggerated
hate
in
germany
is
cultivated
as
a
noble
passion
and
during
the
war
divines
and
generals
vied
with
each
other
in
its
praise
early
in
the
prussian
general
in
command
at
limburg
made
a
speech
in
which
he
extolled
the
advantages
of
hate
and
said
that
there
was
nothing
like
getting
up
in
the
morning
after
having
passed
a
night
in
thought
and
dreams
of
hate

this
page
from
the
scurrilous
publication
of
marten
and
his
colleagues
shows
the
photograph
of
the
wreath
and
the
american
flag
the
phrase
gott
strafe
england
seemed
to
be
all
over
germany
it
was
printed
on
stamps
to
be
affixed
to
the
back
of
letters
like
our
red

stamps
i
even
found
my
german

servant
in
the

affixing
these
stamps
to
the
back
of
all

official
and
otherwise
that
were
sent

was
stopped
when
discovered
paper
money
was
stamped
with
the
words
gott

being
often
added

progressed

refused
to

everyone
is
familiar
with
lissauer
hymn
of
hate
it
is
not
extraordinary
that
one
man
in
a
country
at
war
should
produce
a
composition
of
this
kind
but
it
is
extraordinary
as
showing
the
state
of
mind
of
the
whole
country
that
the
emperor
should
have
given
him
the
high
order
of
the
red
eagle
of
the
second
class
as
a
reward
for
having
composed
this
extraordinary
document
undoubtedly
at
first
the
british
prisoners
of
war
were
treated
very
roughly
and
were
starved
and
beaten
by
their
guards
on
the
way
from
the
front
to
the
concentration
camps
officers
objects
usually
considered
more
than
sacred
in
germany
even
when
wounded
were
subjected
to
brutal
treatment
and
in
the
majority
of
their
prisons
were
treated
more
like
convicts
than
officers
and
gentlemen
as
the
germans
gradually
awoke
to
the
fact
that
president
wilson
was
not
afraid
of
the
german
vote
and
that
the
export
of
supplies
from
america
would
not
be
stopped
this
stream
of
hate
was
turned
on
america
there
was
a
belief
in
germany
that
president
wilson
was
opposed
by
a
majority
of
people
of
the
united
states
that
he
did
not
represent
the
real
sentiment
of
america
and
that
the
sentiment
there
was
favourable
to
germany
unfortunately
many
americans
in
germany
encouraged
the
german
people
and
the
german
government
in
this
belief
americans
used
to
travel
about
giving
lectures
and
making
speeches
attacking
their
own
country
and
their
own
president
and
the
newspapers
published
many
letters
of
similar
import
from
americans
resident
in
germany
one
of
the
most
active
of
these
was
a
man
named
maurice
somborn
a
german
american
who
represented
in
germany
an
american
business
house
he
made
it
a
practice
to
go
about
in
berlin
and
other
cities
and
stand
up
in
cafes
and
beer
halls
in
order
to
make
addresses
attacking
the
president
and
the
united
states
so
bold
did
he
become
that
he
even
in
the
presence
of
a
number
of
people
in
my
room
one
day
said
that
he
would
like
to
hang
secretary
bryan
as
high
as
haman
and
president
wilson
one
foot
higher
the
american
newspapers
stated
that
i
called
a
servant
and
had
him
thrown
out
of
the
embassy
this
statement
is
not
entirely
true
i
selfishly
kept
that
pleasure
for
myself
the
case
of
somborn
gave
me
an
idea
and
i
cabled
to
the
department
of
state
asking
authority
to
take
up
the
passports
of
all
americans
who
abused
their
own
country
on
the
ground
that
they
had
violated
the
right
by
their
abuse
to
the
protection
of
a
passport
the
department
of
state
sustained
my
view
and
by
my
direction
the
consul
in
dresden
took
up
the
passports
of
a
singer
named
rains
and
a
gentleman
of
leisure
named
recknagel
who
had
united
in
addressing
a
letter
to
the
dresden
newspapers
abusing
the
president
it
was
sometime
before
i
got
somborn
passport
and
i
later
on
received
from
him
the
apologies
of
a
broken
and
contrite
man
and
obtained
permission
from
washington
to
issue
him
a
passport
in
order
to
enable
him
to
return
to
america
of
course
these
vilifiers
of
their
own
country
were
loud
in
their
denunciations
of
me
but
the
prospect
of
losing
the
protection
of
their
passports
kept
many
of
these
men
from
open
and
treasonable
denunciation
of
their
own
country
the
government
actually
encouraged
the
formation
of
societies
which
had
for
their
very
object
the
scattering
of
literature
attacking
the
president
and
the
united
states
the
most
conspicuous
of
these
organisations
was
the
league
of
truth
permanently
connected
with
it
was
an
american
dentist
who
had
been
in
jail
in
america
and
who
had
been
expelled
from
dresden
by
the
police
authorities
there
the
secretary
was
a
german
woman
who
posed
as
an
american
and
had
been
on
the
stage
as
a
snake
dancer
the
principal
organiser
was
a
german
named
marten
who
had
won
the
favour
of
the
german
authorities
by
writing
a
book
on
belgium
denying
that
any
atrocities
had
taken
place
there
marten
secured
subscriptions
from
many
germans
and
americans
resident
in
germany
opened
headquarters
in
rooms
on
the
potsdamerstrasse
and
engaged
in
the
business
of
sending
out
pamphlets
and
leaflets
attacking
america
one
of
his
principal
supporters
was
a
man
named
stoddard
who
had
made
a
fortune
by
giving
travel
lectures
in
america
and
who
had
retired
to
his
handsome
villa
in
meran
in
austria
stoddard
issued
a
pamphlet
entitled
what
shall
we
do
with
wilson
and
some
atrocious
attempts
at
verse
all
of
which
were
sent
broadcast
by
the
league
of
truth
this
was
done
with
the
express
permission
of
the
german
authorities
because
during
the
war
no
societies
or
associations
of
any
kind
could
meet
be
formed
or
act
without
the
express
permission
and
superintendence
of
both
the
military
and
police
authorities
anyone
who
has
lived
in
germany
knows
that
it
would
be
impossible
even
in
peace
times
to
hang
a
sign
or
a
wreath
on
a
public
statue
without
the
permission
of
the
local
authorities
and
yet
on
the
emperor
birthday
january
this
league
of
truth
was
permitted
to
place
an
enormous
wreath
over
four
feet
high
on
the
statue
of
frederick
the
great
with
an
american
flag
draped
in
mourning
attached
and
a
silk
banner
on
which
was
printed
in
large
letters
of
gold
wilson
and
his
press
are
not
america
the
league
of
truth
then
had
a
photograph
taken
of
this
wreath
which
was
sent
all
over
germany
again
of
course
with
the
permission
of
the
authorities
the
wreath
and
attachments
in
spite
of
frequent
protests
on
my
part
to
zimmermann
and
von
jagow
remained
in
this
conspicuous
position
until
the
sixth
of
may
after
the
receipt
of
the
note
i
again
called
von
jagow
attention
to
the
presence
of
this
wreath
and
i
told
him
that
if
this
continuing
insult
to
our
flag
and
president
was
not
taken
away
that
i
would
go
the
next
day
with
a
cinematograph
operator
and
take
it
away
myself
the
next
day
the
wreath
had
disappeared
this
league
in
circulars
occasionally
attacked
me
and
in
a
circular
which
they
distributed
shortly
after
my
return
to
germany
at
the
end
of
december
it
was
stated
what
do
you
think
of
the
american
ambassador
when
he
came
to
germany
after
his
trip
to
america
he
brought
a
french
woman
with
him
and
the
worst
of
this
statement
was
that
it
was
true
but
the
league
of
course
did
not
state
that
my
wife
came
with
me
bringing
her
french
maid
by
the
express
permission
of
the
german
foreign
office
i
have
had
occasion
many
times
to
wonder
at
the
curious
twists
of
the
german
mind
but
i
have
never
been
able
to
understand
on
what
possible
theory
the
german
government
permitted
and
even
encouraged
the
existence
of
this
league
of
truth
certainly
the
actions
of
the
league
headed
by
a
snake
dancer
and
a
dentist
would
not
terrorise
the
american
congress
president
wilson
or
me
into
falling
in
with
all
the
views
of
the
german
government
and
if
the
german
government
was
desirous
of
either
the
friendship
or
mine
why
was
this
gang
of
allowed
to
insult
indiscriminately
their
country
their
president
and
their
ambassador
one
of
the
friends
of
marten
head
of
this
league
was
a
man
who
at
the
time
he
was
an
officer
of
the
national
guard
of
the
state
of
new
york
accepted
a
large
sum
of
money
for
expenses
from
bernstorff
of
course
in
any
country
abroad
acceptance
by
an
officer
of
money
from
a
foreign
ambassador
could
not
be
explained
and
could
have
only
one
result
a
blank
wall
and
firing
party
for
the
receiver
of
foreign
pay
perhaps
we
have
grown
so
indulgent
so
soft
and
so
forgetful
of
the
obligations
which
officers
owe
to
their
flag
and
country
that
on
return
from
germany
he
will
be
able
to
go
on
a
triumphant
lecture
tour
through
the
united
states
there
was
published
in
berlin
in
english
a
rather
ridiculous
paper
called
the
owned
by
an
austrian
jewess
who
had
been
married
to
an
englishman
the
foreign
office
after
the
outbreak
of
the
war
practically
took
over
this
sheet
by
buying
monthly
many
thousand
copies
news
coloured
hysterically
to
favour
the
central
empires
was
printed
in
this
paper
which
was
headed
a
paper
for
americans
under
the
editorship
of
an
englishman
of
decent
family
named
stanhope
who
of
course
in
consequence
did
not
have
to
inhabit
the
prison
camp
of
ruhleben
was
a
contributor
to
this
newspaper
and
scurrilous
articles
attacking
president
wilson
appeared
finally
wrote
a
lying
article
for
this
paper
in
which
he
charged
that
conger
of
the
associated
press
had
learned
of
sir
roger
proposed
expedition
that
conger
told
me
that
i
cabled
the
news
to
washington
to
the
state
department
and
that
a
member
of
president
wilson
cabinet
then
gave
the
information
to
the
british
ambassador
later
in
a
wireless
which
the
foreign
office
permitted
to
send
senator
of
new
york
varied
his
lie
and
charged
that
i
had
sent
the
information
direct
to
great
britain
continental
was
distributed
in
the
prison
camps
and
after
article
i
said
to
von
jagow
i
have
had
enough
of
this
nonsense
which
is
supported
by
the
foreign
office
and
if
articles
of
the
nature
of
appear
again
i
shall
make
a
public
statement
that
the
prisoners
of
war
in
germany
are
subjected
to
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
by
having
the
lying
placed
in
their
hands
a
paper
which
purports
to
be
published
for
americans
but
which
is
supported
by
the
foreign
office
owned
by
an
austrian
and
edited
by
a
renegade
englishman
this
business
again
caused
one
to
wonder
at
the
german
psychology
which
seems
to
think
that
the
best
way
to
make
friends
is
to
attack
them
the
author
of
the
gentle
art
of
making
enemies
must
have
attended
a
german
school
an
ambassador
is
supposed
to
be
protected
but
not
even
when
i
filed
affidavits
in
the
foreign
office
in
made
by
the
of
the
league
of
truth
and
by
a
man
who
was
constantly
with
marten
and
the
dentist
that
marten
had
threatened
to
shoot
me
did
the
foreign
office
dare
or
wish
to
do
anything
against
this
ridiculous
league
these
affidavits
were
corroborated
by
a
respectable
restaurant
keeper
in
berlin
and
his
assistants
who
testified
that
marten
with
several
ferocious
looking
german
officers
had
come
to
his
restaurant
looking
for
me
i
never
took
any
precaution
against
these
lunatics
whom
i
knew
to
be
a
bunch
of
cowardly
swindlers
marten
and
his
friends
were
also
engaged
in
a
propaganda
against
the
jews
the
activities
of
marten
were
caused
by
the
fact
that
he
made
money
out
of
his
propaganda
as
numerous
fool
germans
and
traitorous
americans
contributed
to
his
war
chest
and
by
the
fact
that
his
work
was
so
favourably
received
by
the
military
that
this
husky
coward
was
excused
from
all
military
service
it
seemed
too
as
if
the
government
was
anxious
to
cultivate
the
hate
against
america
long
before
american
ammunition
was
delivered
in
any
quantity
to
england
and
long
before
any
at
all
was
delivered
to
france
not
only
did
the
government
influence
newspapers
and
official
gazettes
but
the
official
alleged
that
quantities
of
american
ammunition
were
being
used
on
the
west
front
the
government
seemed
to
think
that
if
it
could
stir
up
enough
hate
against
america
in
germany
on
this
ammunition
question
the
americans
would
become
terrorised
and
stop
the
shipment
the
government
allowed
medals
to
be
struck
in
honour
of
each
little
general
who
conquered
a
town
von
emmich
conqueror
of
liege
a
pernicious
practice
as
each
general
and
princeling
wanted
to
continue
the
war
until
he
could
get
his
face
on
a
medal
even
if
no
one
bought
it
but
the
climax
was
reached
when
medals
celebrating
the
sinking
of
the
were
sold
throughout
germany
even
if
the
sinking
of
the
had
been
justified
only
one
who
has
lived
in
germany
since
the
war
can
understand
the
disgustingly
bad
taste
which
can
gloat
over
the
death
of
women
and
babies
i
can
recall
now
but
two
writers
in
all
germany
who
dared
to
say
a
good
word
for
america
one
of
these
regierungsrat
paul
krause
of
field
marshal
von
der
goltz
wrote
an
article
in
january
in
the
pointing
out
the
american
side
of
the
question
of
this
munition
shipment
and
that
bold
and
fearless
speaker
and
writer
maximilian
harden
dared
to
make
a
defence
of
the
american
standpoint
the
principal
article
in
one
of
the
issues
of
his
paper
was
headed
if
i
were
wilson
after
some
copies
had
been
sold
the
issue
was
confiscated
by
the
police
whether
at
the
instance
of
the
military
or
at
the
instance
of
the
chancellor
i
do
not
know
everyone
had
the
impression
in
berlin
that
this
confiscation
was
by
order
of
general
von
kessel
the
war
governor
of
the
mark
of
brandenburg
i
met
harden
before
the
war
and
occasionally
conversed
with
him
thereafter
once
in
a
while
he
gave
a
lecture
in
the
great
hall
of
the
philharmonic
always
filling
the
hall
to
overflowing
in
his
lectures
which
of
course
were
carefully
passed
on
by
the
police
he
said
nothing
startling
his
newspaper
is
a
weekly
publication
a
little
book
about
seven
inches
by
four
and
a
half
but
wielding
an
influence
not
at
all
commensurate
with
its
size
the
liberal
papers
like
the
largest
paper
of
berlin
the
edited
by
theodor
wolff
while
not
violently
against
america
were
not
favourable
but
the
articles
in
the
conservative
papers
and
even
some
of
the
organs
of
the
catholic
party
invariably
breathed
hatred
against
everything
american
in
the
reichstag
america
and
president
wilson
were
often
attacked
and
never
defended
on
may
thirtieth
in
the
course
of
a
debate
on
the
censorship
strasemann
of
the
national
liberal
party
and
of
the
branch
of
that
party
with
conservative
leanings
violently
opposed
president
wilson
and
said
that
he
was
not
wanted
as
a
peacemaker
government
newspapers
and
politicians
all
united
in
opposing
america
i
believe
that
all
the
bitterness
of
the
hate
formerly
concentrated
on
great
britain
has
now
been
concentrated
on
the
united
states
the
are
hated
worse
than
the
native
americans
they
have
deeply
disappointed
the
germans
first
because
although
contributed
enormously
towards
german
war
charities
the
fact
of
this
contribution
was
not
known
to
the
recipients
in
germany
money
sent
to
the
german
red
cross
from
america
was
acknowledged
by
the
red
cross
but
no
publicity
was
given
in
germany
to
the
fact
that
any
of
the
money
given
was
from
secondly
the
did
not
go
as
they
might
have
done
to
germany
through
neutral
countries
with
american
passports
and
enter
the
german
army
and
thirdly
the
most
bitter
disappointment
of
all
the
have
not
yet
risked
their
property
and
their
necks
their
children
future
and
their
own
tranquillity
by
taking
arms
against
the
government
of
america
in
the
interest
of
the
hohenzollerns
for
years
a
clever
propaganda
had
been
carried
on
in
america
to
make
all
germans
there
feel
that
they
were
germans
of
one
united
nation
to
make
those
who
had
come
from
hesse
and
bavaria
or
saxony
and
württemberg
forget
that
as
late
as
these
countries
had
been
overrun
and
conquered
by
prussian
militarism
when
prince
henry
the
kaiser
brother
visited
america
he
spent
most
of
his
time
with
and
societies
in
order
to
assist
this
propaganda
even
in
peace
time
the
who
returns
to
the
village
in
which
he
lived
as
a
boy
and
who
walks
down
the
village
street
exploiting
himself
and
his
property
does
not
help
good
relations
between
the
two
countries
envy
is
the
mother
of
hate
and
the
envied

returned
receives
only
a
lip
welcome
in
the
village
of
his
ancestors
caricatures
of
uncle
sam
and
of
president
wilson
were
published
in
all
german
papers
a
caricature
representing
our
president
releasing
the
dove
of
peace
with
one
hand
while
he
poured
out
munitions
for
the
allies
with
the
other
was
the
least
unpleasant
as
i
have
said
from
the
tenth
of
august
to
the
of
september
the
emperor
continually
refused
to
receive
me
on
the
ground
that
he
would
not
receive
the
ambassador
of
a
country
which
furnished
munitions
to
the
enemies
of
germany
and
we
were
thoroughly
by
all
the
german
royalties
i
did
not
see
one
however
humble
after
the
outbreak
of
the
war
with
the
exception
of
prince
max
of
baden
who
had
to
do
with
prisoners
of
war
in
germany
and
in
other
countries
on
one
occasion
i
sent
one
of
my
secretaries
to
the
palace
of
princess
august
wilhelm
wife
of
one
of
the
kaiser
sons
with
a
contribution
of
money
for
her
hospital
she
having
announced
that
she
would
personally
receive
contributions
on
that
day
she
took
the
money
from
the
secretary
and
spoke
bitterly
against
america
on
account
of
the
shipment
of
arms
even
some
boxes
of
cigarettes
we
sent
another
royalty
at
the
front
at
christmas
time
were
not
acknowledged
jacobs
who
was
the
correspondent
in
berlin
of
and
who
remained
there
until
about
the
of
april
was
called
on
about
the
sixteenth
of
april
to
the
kommandantur
and
subjected
to
a
during
this
he
was
asked
if
he
knew
about
the
league
of
truth
and
why
he
did
not
join
that
organisation
whether
it
was
a
result
of
his
or
not
i
do
not
know
but
during
the
remainder
of
his
stay
in
berlin
he
was
compelled
to
report
twice
a
day
to
the
police
and
was
not
allowed
to
leave
his
house
after
eight
in
the
evening
the
question
however
put
to
him
shows
the
direct
interest
that
the
german
authorities
took
in
the
existence
of
this
malodorous
organisation
it
appears
in
some
of
the
circulars
issued
by
the
league
of
truth
that
i
was
accused
of
giving
american
passports
to
englishmen
in
order
to
enable
them
to
leave
the
country
after
i
left
germany
there
was
an
interpellation
in
the
reichstag
about
this
and
zimmermann
was
asked
about
the
charge
which
he
said
he
had
investigated
and
found
untrue
in
another
chapter
i
have
spoken
of
the
subject
of
the
selling
of
arms
and
supplies
by
america
to
the
allies
no
german
ever
forgets
this
the
question
of
legality
or
treaties
never
enters
his
mind
he
only
knows
that
american
supplies
and
munitions
killed
his
brother
son
or
father
it
is
a
hate
we
must
meet
for
long
years
chapter
xvii
diplomatic
negotiations
a
few
days
after
the
events
narrated
in
chapter
xii
von
jagow
called
to
see
me
at
the
embassy
and
invited
me
to
visit
the
emperor
at
the
great
general
headquarters
but
he
did
not
state
why
i
was
asked
and
i
do
not
know
to
this
day
whether
the
chancellor
and
those
surrounding
the
emperor
had
determined
on
a
temporary
settlement
of
the
submarine
question
with
the
united
states
and
wished
to
put
that
settlement
out
as
it
were
under
the
protection
of
the
emperor
or
whether
the
emperor
was
undecided
and
those
in
favour
of
peace
wished
me
to
present
to
him
the
american
side
of
the
question
i
incline
to
the
latter
view
von
jagow
informed
me
that
an
officer
from
the
foreign
office
would
accompany
me
and
that
i
should
be
allowed
to
take
a
secretary
and
the
huntsman
without
whom
no
ambassador
ever
travels
in
germany
mr
grew
our
counsellor
was
very
anxious
to
go
and
i
felt
on
account
of
his
excellent
work
as
well
as
his
seniority
that
he
was
entitled
to
be
chosen
lieutenant
von
prittwitz
who
was
attached
to
the
foreign
office
as
a
sort
of
special
aide
to
von
jagow
was
detailed
to
accompany
us
we
were
given
a
special
salon
car
and
left
on
the
evening
of
friday
april
as
we
neared
the
front
by
way
of
the
line
running
through
saar
brucken
our
train
was
often
halted
because
of
long
trains
of
hospital
cars
on
their
way
from
the
front
to
the
base
hospitals
in
the
rear
and
as
we
entered
france
there
were
many
evidences
of
the
obstinate
fights
which
had
raged
in
this
part
of
the
country
in
august
parts
of
the
towns
and
villages
which
we
passed
were
in
ruins
and
rough
trench
lines
were
to
be
discerned
on
some
of
the
hillsides
at
the
stations
weeping
french
women
dressed
in
black
were
not
uncommon
sights
having
just
heard
perhaps
of
the
death
months
before
of
a
husband
sweetheart
or
son
who
had
been
mobilised
with
the
french
army
the
fortress
city
of
metz
through
which
we
passed
seemed
to
be
as
animated
as
a
beehive
trains
were
continuously
passing
artillery
was
to
be
seen
on
the
roads
and
automobiles
were
hurrying
to
and
fro
the
great
general
headquarters
of
the
kaiser
for
the
western
front
is
in
the
town
of
situated
on
the
meuse
in
the
department
of
the
ardennes
which
department
at
that
time
was
the
only
french
department
wholly
in
the
possession
of
the
germans
we
were
received
at
the
railway
station
by
several
officers
and
escorted
in
one
of
the
kaiser
automobiles
which
had
been
set
apart
for
my
use
to
a
villa
in
the
town
of
charleville
owned
by
a
french
manufacturer
named
perin
this
pretty
little
red
brick
villa
had
been
christened
by
the
germans
sachsen
villa
because
it
had
been
occupied
by
the
king
of
saxony
when
he
had
visited
the
kaiser
a
french
family
servant
and
an
old
gardener
had
been
left
in
the
villa
but
for
the
few
meals
which
we
took
there
two
of
the
emperor
body
huntsmen
had
been
assigned
and
they
brought
with
them
some
of
the
emperor
silver
and
china
the
emperor
had
been
occupying
a
large
villa
in
the
town
of
charleville
until
a
few
days
before
our
arrival
after
the
engineer
of
his
private
train
had
been
killed
in
the
railway
station
by
a
bomb
dropped
from
a
french
aeroplane
and
after
another
bomb
had
dropped
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
villa
occupied
by
the
kaiser
he
moved
to
a
red
brick
château
situated
on
a
hill
outside
of
charleville
known
as
either
the
château
bellevue
or
bellaire
nearly
every
day
during
our
stay
we
lunched
and
dined
with
von
in
the
villa
of
a
french
banker
which
he
occupied
about
ten
people
were
present
at
these
dinners
the
zech
prittwitz
two
experts
in
international
law
both
attached
to
the
foreign
office
and
at
two
dinners
von
treutler
the
prussian
minister
to
bavaria
who
had
been
assigned
to
represent
the
foreign
office
near
the
person
of
the
kaiser
and
helfferich
who
towards
the
end
of
our
stay
had
been
summoned
from
berlin
i
had
been
working
hard
at
german
and
as
von
does
not
like
to
talk
english
and
as
some
of
these
persons
did
not
speak
that
language
we
tried
to
carry
on
the
table
conversation
in
german
but
i
know
that
when
i
tried
to
explain
in
german
to
helfferich
the
various
tax
systems
of
america
i
swam
out
far
beyond
my
linguistic
depth
during
our
stay
here
i
received
cables
from
the
department
of
state
which
were
transmitted
from
berlin
in
cipher
and
which
grew
was
able
to
decipher
as
he
had
brought
a
code
book
with
him
in
one
of
these
it
was
expressly
intimated
that
in
any
settlement
of
the
submarine
controversy
america
would
make
no
distinction
between
armed
and
unarmed
merchant
ships
we
formed
for
a
while
quite
a
happy
family
the
french
owners
of
the
villa
seemed
to
have
had
a
fondness
for
mechanical
toys
after
dinner
every
night
these
toys
were
set
going
much
to
the
amusement
of
von
one
of
these
toys
about
two
feet
high
was
a
dancer
and
another
successful
one
was
a
clown
and
a
trained
pig
both
climbing
a
step
ladder
and
performing
marvellous
feats
thereon
grew
who
is
an
excellent
musician
played
the
piano
for
the
chancellor
and
at
his
special
request
played
pieces
by
bach
the
favourite
composer
of
von
deceased
wife
one
day
we
had
tea
in
the
garden
of
the
villa
formerly
occupied
by
the
emperor
with
the
prince
of
pless
who
is
always
with
the
kaiser
and
who
seemed
to
be
a
prime
favourite
with
him
von
treutler
and
others
and
motored
with
prince
pless
to
see
some
marvellous
himalayan
pheasants
reared
by
an
old
frenchman
an
who
seemed
to
have
a
strong
instinct
to
keep
something
in
captivity
the
kaiser
automobile
which
he
had
placed
at
my
disposal
had
two
loaded
rifles
standing
upright
in
racks
at
the
right
and
left
sides
of
the
car
ready
for
instant
use
on
one
day
we
motored
always
of
course
in
charge
of
the
officers
detailed
to
take
care
of
us
to
the
ancient
walled
city
of
rocroy
and
through
the
beautiful
part
of
the
ardennes
forest
lying
to
the
east
of
it
returning
to
charleville
along
the
heights
above
the
valley

with

the
french
food
commission
before
the
cottage
at
bazeilles
where
napoleon
iii
and
bismarck
met
after
the
battle
of
sedan
the
feeding
of
the
french
population
which
is
carried
on
by
the
american
relief
commission
was
a
very
interesting
thing
to
see
and
in
company
with
one
of
the
members
of
the
french
committee
we
saw
the
workings
of
this
system
of
american
relief
we
first
visited
a
storehouse
in
charleville
the
headquarters
for
the
relief
district
of
which
charleville
may
be
called
the
capital
for
relief
purposes
northern
france
is
divided
into
six
districts
from
the
central
distribution
point
in
each
district
food
is
sent
to
the
commune
within
the
district
the
commune
being
the
ultimate
unit
of
distribution
and
each
commune
containing
on
the
average
about
five
hundred
souls
we
then
motored
to
one
of
the
communes
where
the
distribution
of
food
for
the
week
was
to
take
place
that
afternoon
here
in
a
factory
closed
since
the
war
the
people
of
the
commune
were
lined
up
with
their
baskets
waiting
for
their
share
of
the
rations
on
entering
a
large
room
of
the
factory
each
stopped
first
at
a
desk
and
there
either
paid
in
cash
for
the
week
allowance
of
rations
or
signed
an
agreement
to
pay
at
some
future
date
the
individuals
who
had
no
prospect
of
being
able
to
pay
received
the
rations
for
nothing
about
were
in
each
class
the
money
used
was
not
always
french
or
real
money
but
was
as
a
rule
the
paper
money
issued
in
that
part
of
northern
france
by
each
town
and
redeemable
after
the
war
signs
were
hung
up
showing
the
quantity
that
each
person
was
entitled
to
receive
for
the
next
fifteen
days
and
the
sale
price
per
kilo
to
each
inhabitant
for
instance
in
this
particular
period
for
the
first
fifteen
days
of
the
month
of
may
each
inhabitant
could
in
this
district
receive
the
following
allowances
at
the
following
rates

fr
in
addition
to
these
articles
each
inhabitant
of
the
commune
which
we
visited
also
received
on
the
day
of
our
visit
a
small
quantity
of
carrot
seed
to
plant
in
the
small
plot
of
ground
which
each
was
permitted
to
retain
out
of
his
own
land
by
the
german
authorities
the
unfortunate
people
who
received
this
allowance
looked
very
poor
and
very
hungry
and
very
miserable
many
of
them
spoke
to
me
not
only
here
but
also
in
charleville
and
expressed
their
great
gratitude
to
the
american
people
for
what
was
being
done
for
them
those
in
charleville
said
that
they
had
heard
that
i
was
in
their
town
because
of
trouble
pending
between
america
and
germany
they
said
they
hoped
that
there
would
be
no
war
between
the
two
countries
because
if
war
came
they
did
not
know
what
would
become
of
them
and
that
in
the
confusion
of
war
they
would
surely
be
left
to
starve
in
charleville
notices
were
posted
directing
the
inhabitants
not
to
go
out
on
the
streets
after
i
think
eight
in
the
evening
and
also
notices
informing
the
population
that
they
would
be
allowed
a
small
quantity
of
their
own
land
for
the
purpose
of
growing
potatoes
after
visiting
the
factory
building
where
the
distribution
of
rations
was
taking
place
we
motored
to
sedan
stopping
on
the
way
at
the
hamlet
of
bazeilles
and
visiting
the
cottage
where
bismarck
and
emperor
napoleon
the
third
had
their
historic
interview
after
the
battle
of
sedan
the
old
lady
who
owns
this
house
received
us
and
showed
us
bullet
marks
made
on
her
house
in
the
war
of
as
well
as
in
the
present
war
she
apologised
because
she
had
had
the
broken
by
a
rifle
shot
in
this
war
replaced
on
account
of
the
cold
as
a
girl
she
had
received
bismarck
and
napoleon
and
had
shown
them
to
the
room
upstairs
where
they
had
held
their
consultation
i
asked
her
which
chair
in
this
room
bismarck
had
sat
in
and
sat
in
it
myself
for
luck
i
also
contributed
to
the
collection
of
gold
pieces
given
to
her
by
those
who
had
visited
her
cottage
in
sedan
we
visited
an
old
mill
where
stores
of
the
relief
commission
were
kept
and
in
the
mayor
office
were
present
at
a
sort
of
consultation
between
the
prussian
officers
and
members
of
the
french
committee
of
sedan
in
which
certain
details
relative
to
the
feeding
of
the
population
were
discussed
the
relief
work
is
not
of
course
carried
on
right
up
to
the
battle
line
but
we
visited
a
small
village
not
many
kilometres
in
the
rear
of
the
german
line
in
this
village
we
were
as
before
shown
the
stores
kept
for
distribution
by
the
relief
commission
as
there
were
many
soldiers
in
this
village
i
said
i
thought
that
these
soldiers
must
have
stores
of
their
own
but
in
order
to
be
sure
that
they
were
not
living
on
the
supplies
of
the
relief
commission
i
thought
it
only
fair
that
i
should
see
where
the
soldiers
stores
were
kept
i
was
taken
across
the
railroad
track
to
where
their
stores
were
kept
and
judging
from
the
labels
on
the
barrels
and
boxes
i
should
say
that
a
great
many
of
these
stores
had
come
from
holland
during
this
trip
about
the
country
i
saw
a
number
of
women
and
girls
working
or
attempting
to
work
in
the
fields
their
appearance
was
so
different
from
that
of
the
usual
peasant
that
i
spoke
to
the
accompanying
officers
about
it
i
was
told
however
that
these
were
the
peasants
of
the
locality
who
dressed
unusually
well
in
that
part
of
france
later
on
in
charleville
at
the
lodging
of
an
officer
and
with
count
wengersky
who
was
detailed
to
act
as
sort
of
interpreter
and
guide
to
the
american
relief
commission
workers
i
met
the
members
of
the
american
relief
commission
who
were
working
in
northern
france
and
who
had
been
brought
on
a
special
train
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
me
to
charleville
this
count
wengersky
spoke
english
well
having
been
for
a
number
of
years
agent
of
the
hamburg
american
line
in
london
he
was
used
to
dealing
with
americans
and
was
possessed
of
more
tact
than
usually
falls
to
the
lot
of
the
average
prussian
officer
we
had
tea
and
cakes
in
these
lodgings
and
then
some
of
the
americans
drew
me
aside
and
told
me
the
secret
of
the
peculiar
looking
peasants
whom
i
had
seen
at
work
in
the
fields
surrounding
charleville
it
seems
that
the
germans
had
endeavoured
to
get
volunteers
from
the
great
industrial
town
of
lille
roubeix
and
tourcoing
to
work
these
fields
that
after
the
posting
of
the
notices
calling
for
volunteers
only
fourteen
had
appeared
the
germans
then
gave
orders
to
seize
a
certain
number
of
inhabitants
and
send
them
out
to
farms
in
the
outlying
districts
to
engage
in
agricultural
work
the
americans
told
me
that
this
order
was
carried
out
with
the
greatest
barbarity
that
a
man
would
come
home
at
night
and
find
that
his
wife
or
children
had
disappeared
and
no
one
could
tell
him
where
they
had
gone
except
that
the
neighbours
would
relate
that
the
german
officers
and
a
file
of
soldiers
had
carried
them
off
for
instance
in
a
house
of
a
merchant
who
had
perhaps
two
daughters
of
fifteen
and
seventeen
and
a
man
servant
the
two
daughters
and
the
servant
would
be
seized
and
sent
off
together
to
work
for
the
germans
in
some
little
farm
house
whose
location
was
not
disclosed
to
the
parents
the
americans
told
me
that
this
sort
of
thing
was
causing
such
indignation
among
the
population
of
these
towns
that
they
feared
a
great
uprising
and
a
consequent
slaughter
and
burning
by
the
germans
that
night
at
dinner
i
spoke
to
von
about
this
and
told
him
that
it
seemed
to
me
absolutely
outrageous
and
that
without
consulting
with
my
government
i
was
prepared
to
protest
in
the
name
of
humanity
against
a
continuance
of
this
treatment
of
the
civil
population
of
occupied
france
the
chancellor
told
me
that
he
had
not
known
of
it
that
it
was
the
result
of
orders
given
by
the
military
that
he
would
speak
to
the
emperor
about
it
and
that
he
hoped
to
be
able
to
stop
further
deportations
i
believe
that
they
were
stopped
but
twenty
thousand
or
more
who
had
been
taken
from
their
homes
were
not
returned
until
months
afterwards
i
said
in
a
speech
which
i
made
in
may
on
my
return
to
america
that
it
required
the
joint
efforts
of
the
pope
the
king
of
spain
and
our
president
to
cause
the
return
of
these
people
to
their
homes
and
i
then
saw
that
some
german
press
agency
had
come
out
with
an
article
that
i
had
made
false
statements
about
this
matter
because
these
people
were
not
returned
to
their
homes
as
a
result
of
the
representations
of
the
pope
the
king
of
spain
and
our
president
but
were
sent
back
because
the
germans
had
no
further
use
for
them
it
seems
to
me
that
this
denial
makes
the
case
rather
worse
than
before
at
the
chancellor
house
in
the
evenings
we
had
discussions
on
the
submarine
situation
and
i
had
several
long
talks
with
von
alone
in
a
corner
of
the
room
while
the
others
listened
to
music
or
set
the
mechanical
toys
in
motion
these
discussions
without
doubt
were
reported
to
the
emperor
either
by
the
chancellor
or
by
von
treutler
who
at
that
time
was
high
in
favor
with
his
majesty
i
remember
on
one
evening
i
was
asked
the
question
as
to
what
america
could
do
supposing
the
almost
impossible
that
america
should
resent
the
recommencement
of
ruthless
submarine
warfare
by
the
germans
and
declare
war
i
said
that
nearly
all
of
the
great
inventions
used
in
this
war
had
been
made
by
americans
that
the
very
submarine
which
formed
the
basis
of
our
discussion
was
an
american
invention
and
so
were
the
barbed
wire
and
the
aeroplane
the
ironclad
the
telephone
and
the
telegraph
so
necessary
to
trench
warfare
that
even
that
method
of
warfare
had
been
first
developed
on
something
of
the
present
scale
in
our
civil
war
and
that
i
believed
that
if
forced
to
it
american
genius
could
produce
some
invention
which
might
have
a
decisive
effect
in
this
war
my
german
auditors
seemed
inclined
to
believe
that
there
was
something
in
my
contentions
but
they
said
while
possibly
you
might
invent
something
in
america
while
possibly
you
will
furnish
money
and
supplies
to
the
allies
you
have
no
men
and
the
public
sentiment
of
your
country
is
such
that
you
will
not
be
able
to
raise
an
army
large
enough
to
make
any
impression
i
said
that
possibly
if
hostilities
once
broke
out
with
the
germans
the
germans
might
force
us
by
the
commission
of
such
acts
as
had
aroused
england
to
pass
a
law
for
universal
military
service
this
proposition
of
mine
was
branded
by
the
germans
as
absolutely
impossible
and
therefore
i
am
sure
that
the
adoption
by
the
united
states
of
universal
service
in
the
first
round
of
the
war
struck
a
very
severe
blow
at
the
morale
of
germany
the
chancellor
always
desired
to
make
any
settlement
of
the
submarine
question
contingent
upon
our
doing
something
against
england
but
i
again
and
again
insisted
that
we
could
not
agree
to
do
anything
against
some
other
power
as
a
condition
of
obtaining
a
recognition
of
our
rights
from
the
german
empire
during
my
stay
at
the
general
headquarters
general
falkenhayn
although
he
was
there
at
the
time
carefully
avoided
me
which
i
took
to
be
a
sign
that
he
was
in
favour
of
war
with
america
in
fact
i
heard
afterwards
that
he
had
insisted
on
giving
his
views
on
the
subject
but
that
a
very
high
authority
had
told
him
to
confine
himself
to
military
operations
after
we
had
been
a
day
or
so
at
charleville
the
helfferich
arrived
i
have
always
believed
that
he
was
sent
for
to
add
his
weight
to
the
arguments
in
favour
of
peace
and
to
point
out
that
it
was
necessary
for
germany
to
hate
the
friendship
of
america
after
the
war
so
as
to
have
markets
where
she
could
place
her
goods
and
i
am
convinced
that
at
this
time
at
any
rate
the
influence
of
helfferich
was
cast
in
the
scale
in
favour
of
peace
finally
i
was
told
that
on
the
next
day
which
was
monday
may
first
i
was
to
lunch
with
the
emperor
grew
was
invited
to
accompany
me
and
the
chancellor
said
that
he
would
call
for
me
about
an
hour
before
the
time
set
for
lunch
as
the
emperor
desired
to
have
a
talk
with
me
before
lunch
in
the
afternoon
an
extract
from
the
log
of
a
german
submarine
commander
was
sent
to
me
in
which
the
submarine
commander
had
stated
that
he
had
sighted
a
vessel
which
he
could
easily
have
torpedoed
but
as
the
vessel
was
one
hundred
and
twenty
miles
from
land
he
had
not
done
so
because
the
crew
might
not
be
able
from
that
distance
to
reach
a
harbour
when
the
chancellor
called
for
me
the
following
morning
he
asked
me
if
i
had
read
this
extract
from
the
submarine
log
and
noted
how
he
had
refrained
from
torpedoing
a
boat
one
hundred
and
twenty
miles
from
land
i
told
the
chancellor
that
i
had
read
the
extract
but
that
i
had
also
read
in
the
newspaper
that
very
morning
that
a
ship
had
been
torpedoed
in
stormy
weather
at
exactly
the
same
distance
from
land
and
the
crew
compelled
to
seek
safety
in
the
ship
boats
that
anyway
one
swallow
did
not
make
a
summer
and
that
reports
were
continually
being
received
of
boats
being
torpedoed
at
great
distances
from
land
we
then
got
in
the
motor
and
motored
to
the
château
about
a
mile
off
where
the
kaiser
resided
we
got
out
of
the
motor
before
going
into
the
courtyard
of
the
château
and
immediately
i
was
taken
by
the
chancellor
into
a
garden
on
the
gently
sloping
hillside
below
the
château
here
the
emperor
dressed
in
uniform
was
walking
as
i
drew
near
the
emperor
he
said
immediately
do
you
come
like
the
great
bearing
peace
or
war
in
either
hand
by
this
he
referred
of
course
to
the
episode
in
which
quintus
fabius
maximus
chief
of
the
roman
envoys
sent
to
hannibal
in
the
second
punic
war
doubled
his
toga
in
his
hand
held
it
up
and
said
in
this
fold
i
carry
peace
and
war
choose
which
you
will
have
give
us
which
you
prefer
was
the
reply
then
take
war
answered
the
roman
letting
the
toga
fall
we
accept
the
gift
cried
the
carthaginian
senator
and
welcome
i
said
no
your
majesty
only
hoping
that
the
differences
between
two
friendly
nations
may
be
adjusted
the
emperor
then
spoke
of
what
he
termed
the
uncourteous
tone
of
our
notes
saying
that
we
charged
the
germans
with
barbarism
in
warfare
and
that
as
emperor
and
head
of
the
church
he
had
wished
to
carry
on
the
war
in
a
knightly
manner
he
referred
to
his
own
speech
to
the
members
of
the
reichstag
at
the
commencement
of
the
war
and
said
that
the
nations
opposed
to
germany
had
used
unfair
methods
and
means
that
the
french
especially
were
not
like
the
french
of
but
that
their
officers
instead
of
being
nobles
came
from
no
one
knew
where
he
then
referred
to
the
efforts
to
starve
out
germany
and
keep
out
milk
and
said
that
before
he
would
allow
his
family
and
to
starve
he
would
blow
up
windsor
castle
and
the
whole
royal
family
of
england
we
then
had
a
long
discussion
in
detail
of
the
whole
submarine
question
in
the
course
of
which
the
emperor
said
that
the
submarine
had
come
to
stay
that
it
was
a
weapon
recognised
by
all
countries
and
that
he
had
seen
a
picture
of
a
proposed
giant
submarine
in
an
american
paper
the
he
stated
that
anyway
there
was
no
longer
any
international
law
to
this
last
statement
the
chancellor
agreed
he
further
said
that
a
person
on
an
enemy
merchant
ship
was
like
a
man
travelling
on
a
cart
behind
the
battle
lines
he
had
no
just
cause
of
complaint
if
injured
he
asked
me
why
we
had
done
nothing
to
england
because
of
her
alleged
violations
of
international
law
why
we
had
not
broken
the
british
blockade
in
addition
to
the
technical
arguments
based
on
international
law
i
answered
that
no
note
of
the
united
states
had
made
any
general
charge
of
barbarism
against
germany
that
we
complained
of
the
manner
of
the
use
of
submarines
and
nothing
more
that
we
could
never
promise
to
do
anything
to
england
or
to
any
other
country
in
return
for
a
promise
from
germany
or
any
third
country
to
keep
the
rules
of
international
law
and
respect
the
rights
and
lives
of
our
citizens
that
we
were
only
demanding
our
rights
under
the
recognised
rules
of
international
law
and
it
was
for
us
to
decide
which
rights
we
would
enforce
first
that
as
i
had
already
told
the
chancellor
if
two
men
entered
my
grounds
and
one
stepped
on
my
flower
beds
and
the
other
killed
my
sister
i
should
probably
first
pursue
the
murderer
of
my
sister
that
those
travelling
on
the
seas
in
enemy
merchant
ships
were
in
a
different
position
from
those
travelling
in
a
cart
behind
the
enemy
battle
lines
on
land
because
the
land
travellers
were
on
enemy
territory
while
those
on
the
sea
were
on
territory
which
beyond
the
limit
was
free
and
in
no
sense
enemy
territory
we
also
discussed
the
position
taken
by
the
german
government
in
one
of
the
notes
in
which
the
german
expert
had
taken
the
position
that
a
cargo
of
food
destined
for
an
armed
enemy
port
was
presumed
to
be
for
the
armies
of
the
enemy
and
therefore
contraband
the
emperor
spoke
of
the
case
of
the
with
some
bitterness
but
when
i
went
into
an
explanation
the
chancellor
joined
in
the
conversation
and
said
that
our
position
was
undoubtedly
correct
i
said
that
it
was
not
our
business
to
break
the
blockade
that
there
were
plenty
of
german
agents
in
the
united
states
who
could
send
food
ships
and
test
the
question
that
one
ship
i
knew
of
the
laden
with
food
had
been
seized
by
the
british
who
then
compromised
with
the
owners
paying
them
i
believed
a
large
sum
for
the
disputed
cargo
and
in
taking
up
the
doctrine
of
ultimate
destination
of
goods
goods
sent
to
a
neutral
country
but
really
destined
for
a
belligerent
i
said
i
thought
that
during
our
civil
war
we
had
taken
against
england
exactly
the
same
stand
which
england
now
took
and
i
said
i
thought
that
one
of
the
decisions
of
our
supreme
court
was
based
on
a
shipment
to
matamoras
mexico
but
which
the
supreme
court
had
decided
was
really
for
the
confederacy
discussing
the
submarine
question
the
emperor
and
chancellor
spoke
of
the
warning
given
in
the
case
and
i
said
if
the
chancellor
warns
me
not
to
go
out
on
the
wilhelmplatz
where
i
have
a
perfect
right
to
go
the
fact
that
he
gave
the
warning
does
not
justify
him
in
killing
me
if
i
disregarded
his
warning
and
go
where
i
have
a
right
to
go
the
conversation
then
became
more
general
and
we
finally
left
the
garden
and
went
into
the
château
where
the
emperor
aides
and
guests
were
impatiently
waiting
for
lunch
this
conversation
lasted
far
beyond
lunch
time
anxious
heads
were
seen
appearing
from
the
windows
and
terraces
of
the
château
to
which
we
finally
adjourned
i
sat
between
the
emperor
and
prince
pless
conversation
was
general
for
the
most
of
the
time
and
subjects
such
as
the
suffragettes
and
the
peace
expedition
of
henry
ford
were
amusingly
discussed
after
lunch
i
again
had
a
long
talk
with
the
emperor
but
of
a
more
general
nature
than
the
conversation
in
the
garden
that
night
about
eleven
after
again
dining
with
the
chancellor
we
left
charleville
in
the
same
special
salon
car
arriving
at
berlin
about
four
the
next
day
where
at
the
station
were
a
crowd
of
german
and
american
newspaper
correspondents
all
anxious
to
know
what
had
happened
at
this
last
dinner
at
the
chancellor
he
took
me
off
in
a
corner
and
said
as
i
understand
it
what
america
wants
is
cruiser
warfare
on
the
part
of
the
submarines
and
i
said
yes
that
is
it
exactly
they
may
exercise
the
right
of
visit
and
search
must
not
torpedo
or
sink
vessels
without
warning
and
must
not
sink
any
vessel
unless
the
passengers
and
crew
are
put
in
a
place
of
safety
on
the
morning
of
the
third
of
may
i
heard
that
the
german
note
had
been
drafted
but
that
it
would
contain
a
clause
to
the
effect
that
while
the
german
submarines
would
not
go
beyond
cruiser
warfare
this
rule
nevertheless
would
not
apply
to
armed
merchantmen
as
such
a
proposition
as
this
would
of
course
only
bring
up
the
subject
again
i
immediately
ordered
my
automobile
and
called
on
the
spanish
ambassador
stating
to
him
what
i
had
heard
about
the
contents
of
the
note
that
this
would
mean
without
doubt
a
break
with
america
and
that
as
i
had
been
instructed
to
hand
the
embassy
over
to
him
i
had
come
to
tell
him
of
that
fact
i
gave
the
same
information
to
other
colleagues
of
course
hoping
that
what
i
said
would
directly
or
indirectly
reach
the
ears
of
the
german
foreign
office
whether
it
did
or
not
i
do
not
know
but
the
note
when
received
did
not
contain
any
exception
with
reference
to
armed
merchantmen
with
the
receipt
of
the
note
and
the
answer
thereto
which
declined
assent
to
the
claim
of
germany
to
define
its
attitude
toward
our
rights
in
accordance
with
what
we
might
do
in
regard
to
the
enforcement
of
our
rights
against
england
the
submarine
question
seemed
at
least
for
the
moment
settled
i
however
immediately
warned
the
department
that
i
believed
that
the
rulers
of
germany
would
at
some
future
date
forced
by
public
opinion
and
by
the
von
tirpitz
and
conservative
parties
take
up
ruthless
submarine
war
again
possibly
in
the
autumn
but
at
any
rate
about
february
or
march
in
my
last
conversation
with
the
chancellor
before
leaving
the
great
general
headquarters
when
he
referred
to
the
cruiser
warfare
of
the
submarines
he
also
said
i
hope
now
that
if
we
settle
this
matter
your
president
will
be
great
enough
to
take
up
the
question
of
peace
it
was
as
a
result
of
intimations
from
government
circles
that
after
my
return
to
berlin
i
gave
an
interview
to
a
representative
of
a
munich
newspaper
expressing
my
faith
in
the
coming
of
peace
although
i
was
careful
to
say
that
it
might
be
a
matter
of
months
or
even
years
thereafter
on
many
occasions
the
chancellor
impressed
upon
me
the
fact
that
america
must
do
something
towards
arranging
a
peace
and
that
if
nothing
was
done
to
this
end
public
opinion
in
germany
would
undoubtedly
force
a
resumption
of
a
ruthless
submarine
war
in
september
of
i
having
mentioned
that
gerard
was
going
to
the
united
states
on
a
short
visit
von
jagow
insistently
urged
me
to
go
also
in
order
to
make
every
effort
to
induce
the
president
to
do
something
towards
peace
and
as
a
result
of
his
urging
and
as
a
result
of
my
own
desire
to
make
the
situation
clear
in
america
i
sailed
from
copenhagen
on
the
of
september
with
gerard
on
the
danish
ship
bound
for
new
york
i
had
spent
almost
three
years
in
berlin
having
been
absent
during
that
time
from
the
city
only
five
or
six
days
at
kiel
and
two
in
silesia
in
with
two
weeks
at
munich
in
the
autumn
two
days
at
munich
and
two
days
at
in
and
two
at
heringsdorf
in
the
summer
of
the
same
year
with
visits
to
british
prison
camps
scattered
through
the
two
and
a
half
years
of
war
on
the
were
herbert
swope
of
the
york
and
william
bullitt
of
the
who
had
been
spending
some
time
in
germany
i
impressed
upon
each
of
these
gentlemen
my
fixed
belief
that
germany
intended
shortly
unless
some
definite
move
was
made
toward
peace
to
commence
ruthless
submarine
war
and
they
made
this
view
clear
in
the
articles
which
they
wrote
for
their
respective
newspapers
swope
articles
which
appeared
in
the
york
were
immediately
republished
by
him
in
a
book
called
inside
the
german
empire
in
swope
book
on
page
he
says
the
campaign
for
the
ruthless
warfare
is
regarded
by
one
man
in
this
country
who
speaks
with
the
highest
german
authority
as
being
in
the
nature
of
a
threat
intended
to
accelerate
and
force
upon
us
a
movement
toward
peace
ambassador
gerard
had
his
attention
drawn
to
this
just
before
he
left
berlin
but
he
declined
to
accept
the
interpretation
on
page
he
writes
our
embassy
in
berlin
expected
just
such
a
demonstration
as
was
given
by
the
in
october
when
she
sank
six
vessels
off
nantucket
as
a
lesson
of
what
germany
could
do
in
our
waters
if
war
came
on
page
he
says
further
throughout
germany
the
objection
for
the
resumption
of
ruthless
warfare
of
the
type
grows
stronger
day
by
day
the
chancellor
is
holding
out
against
it
but
how
long
he
can
restrain
it
no
one
can
say
i
left
germany
convinced
that
only
peace
could
prevent
its
resumption
and
the
same
opinion
is
held
by
every
german
with
whom
i
spoke
and
it
is
held
also
by
ambassador
gerard
the
possibility
was
so
menacing
that
the
principal
cause
of
the
ambassador
return
in
october
was
that
he
might
report
to
washington
the
point
was
set
out
in
press
despatches
at
that
time
i
wrote
a
preface
to
swope
book
for
the
express
purpose
of
informing
the
american
public
in
this
way
that
i
believed
that
germany
intended
at
an
early
date
to
resume
the
ruthless
warfare
our
trip
home
on
the
was
without
incident
except
for
the
fact
that
on
the
ninth
day
of
october
swope
came
to
the
door
of
my
stateroom
about
twelve
at
night
and
informed
me
that
the
captain
had
told
him
to
tell
me
that
the
wireless
had
brought
the
news
that
german
submarines
were
operating
directly
ahead
of
us
and
had
just
sunk
six
ships
in
the
neighbourhood
of
nantucket
i
imagine
that
the
captain
slightly
changed
the
course
of
our
ship
but
next
day
the
odour
of
burning
oil
was
quite
noticeable
for
hours
these
danish
ships
in
making
the
trip
from
copenhagen
to
new
york
were
compelled
to
put
in
at
the
port
of
kirkwall
in
the
orkney
islands
north
of
scotland
where
the
ship
was
searched
by
the
british
authorities
on
the
occasion
of
our
visit
to
kirkwall
on
this
trip
a
swede
who
had
been
so
foolish
as
to
make
a
sketch
of
the
harbour
and
defences
of
kirkwall
from
the
top
deck
of
the
was
taken
off
the
boat
by
the
british
the
british
had
very
cleverly
spotted
him
doing
this
from
the
shore
or
a
neighbouring
boat
through
a
telescope
ships
can
enter
kirkwall
only
by
daylight
and
at
six
every
evening
trawlers
draw
a
net
across
the
entrance
to
the
harbour
as
a
protection
against
submarines
a
passage
through
this
net
is
not
opened
until
daylight
the
following
morning
captain
thomson
of
the
the
ship
which
carried
us
to
america
and
back
to
copenhagen
by
his
evident
mastery
of
his
profession
gave
to
all
of
his
passengers
a
feeling
of
confidence
on
the
somewhat
perilous
voyage
in
those
dangerous
waters
when
i
reached
america
on
october
eleventh
i
was
given
a
most
flattering
reception
and
the
freedom
of
the
city
of
new
york
within
a
few
days
after
my
arrival
the
president
sent
for
me
to
visit
him
at
shadow
lawn
at
long
branch
and
i
was
with
him
for
over
four
hours
and
a
quarter
in
our
first
conference
i
saw
him
of
course
after
the
election
before
returning
to
germany
and
in
fact
sailed
on
the
fourth
of
december
at
his
special
request
before
i
left
i
was
impressed
with
the
idea
that
he
desired
above
all
things
both
to
keep
and
to
make
peace
of
course
this
question
of
making
peace
is
a
very
delicate
one
a
direct
offer
on
our
part
might
have
subjected
us
to
the
same
treatment
which
we
gave
great
britain
during
our
civil
war
when
great
britain
made
overtures
looking
towards
the
establishment
of
peace
and
the
north
answered
practically
telling
the
british
government
that
it
could
attend
to
its
own
business
that
it
would
brook
no
interference
and
would
regard
further
overtures
as
unfriendly
acts
the
germans
started
this
war
without
any
consultation
with
the
united
states
and
then
seemed
to
think
that
they
had
a
right
to
demand
that
the
united
states
make
peace
for
them
on
such
terms
and
at
such
time
as
they
chose
and
that
the
failure
to
do
so
gave
them
a
vested
right
to
break
all
the
laws
of
warfare
against
their
enemies
and
to
murder
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
on
the
high
seas
in
violation
of
the
declared
principles
of
international
law
nevertheless
i
think
that
the
inclination
of
the
president
was
to
go
very
far
towards
the
forcing
of
peace
our
trip
from
new
york
to
copenhagen
was
uneventful
cold
and
dark
we
were
captured
by
a
british
cruiser
west
of
the
orkneys
and
taken
in
for
the
usual
search
to
the
port
of
kirkwall
where
we
remained
two
days
the
president
impressed
upon
me
his
great
interest
in
the
belgians
deported
to
germany
the
action
of
germany
in
thus
carrying
a
great
part
of
the
male
population
of
belgium
into
virtual
slavery
had
roused
great
indignation
in
america
as
the
revered
cardinal
farley
said
to
me
a
few
days
before
my
departure
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
times
of
the
medes
and
the
persians
to
find
a
like
example
of
a
whole
people
carried
into
bondage
mr
grew
had
made
representations
about
this
to
the
chancellor
and
on
my
return
i
immediately
took
up
the
question
i
was
informed
that
it
was
a
military
measure
that
ludendorf
had
feared
that
the
british
would
break
through
and
overrun
belgium
and
that
the
military
did
not
propose
to
have
a
hostile
population
at
their
backs
who
might
cut
the
rail
lines
of
communication
telephones
and
telegraphs
and
that
for
this
reason
the
deportation
had
been
decided
on
i
was
however
told
that
i
would
be
given
permission
to
visit
these
belgians
the
passes
nevertheless
which
alone
made
such
visiting
possible
were
not
delivered
until
a
few
days
before
i
left
germany
several
of
these
belgians
who
were
put
at
work
in
berlin
managed
to
get
away
and
come
to
see
me
they
gave
me
a
harrowing
account
of
how
they
had
been
seized
in
belgium
and
made
to
work
in
germany
at
making
munitions
to
be
used
probably
against
their
own
friends
i
said
to
the
chancellor
there
are
belgians
employed
in
making
shells
contrary
to
all
rules
of
war
and
the
hague
conventions
he
said
i
do
not
believe
it
i
said
my
automobile
is
at
the
door
i
can
take
you
in
four
minutes
to
where
thirty
belgians
are
working
on
the
manufacture
of
shells
but
he
did
not
find
time
to
go
americans
must
understand
that
the
germans
will
stop
at
nothing
to
win
this
war
and
that
the
only
thing
they
respect
is
force
while
i
was
in
america
von
jagow
as
had
been
predicted
by
his
enemies
in
berlin
had
fallen
and
zimmermann
had
been
given
his
place
i
remained
a
day
in
copenhagen
in
order
to
arrange
for
the
transportation
to
germany
of
the
three
tons
of
food
which
i
had
brought
from
new
york
and
also
in
order
to
lunch
with
count
rantzau
the
german
minister
a
most
able
diplomat
therefore
the
president
peace
note
arrived
in
berlin
just
ahead
of
me
and
was
delivered
by
mr
grew
a
few
hours
before
my
arrival
joseph
grew
of
boston
was
next
in
command
during
all
my
stay
in
berlin
he
most
ably
carried
on
the
work
of
the
embassy
during
my
absence
on
the
trip
to
america
in
the
autumn
of
and
at
all
times
was
of
the
greatest
assistance
to
me
i
hope
to
see
him
go
far
in
his
career
this
note
was
dated
december
eighteenth
and
was
addressed
by
the
secretary
of
state
to
the
american
ambassadors
at
the
capitals
of
the
belligerent
powers
it
commenced
as
follows
the
president
directs
me
to
send
you
the
following
communication
to
be
presented
immediately
to
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
of
the
government
to
which
you
are
accredited
the
president
of
the
united
states
has
instructed
me
to
suggest
to
the
here
is
inserted
a
designation
of
the
government
addressed
a
course
of
action
in
regard
to
the
present
war
which
he
hopes
that
the
government
will
take
under
consideration
as
suggested
in
the
most
friendly
spirit
etc
in
the
note
which
was
sent
to
the
central
powers
it
was
stated
the
suggestion
which
i
am
instructed
to
make
the
president
has
long
had
it
in
mind
to
offer
he
is
somewhat
embarrassed
to
offer
it
at
this
particular
time
because
it
may
now
seem
to
have
been
prompted
by
a
desire
to
play
a
part
in
connection
with
the
recent
overtures
of
the
central
powers
of
course
the
president
thus
referred
to
the
address
made
by
in
the
reichstag
in
december
in
which
after
reviewing
generally
the
military
situation
the
chancellor
said
in
a
deep
moral
and
religious
sense
of
duty
towards
this
nation
and
beyond
it
towards
humanity
the
emperor
now
considers
that
the
moment
has
come
for
official
action
towards
peace
his
majesty
therefore
in
complete
harmony
and
in
common
with
our
allies
decided
to
propose
to
the
hostile
powers
to
enter
peace
negotiations
and
the
chancellor
continued
saying
that
a
note
to
this
effect
had
been
transmitted
that
morning
to
all
hostile
powers
through
the
representatives
of
these
powers
to
whom
the
interests
and
rights
of
germany
in
the
enemy
states
had
been
entrusted
and
that
therefore
the
representatives
of
spain
the
united
states
and
switzerland
had
been
asked
to
forward
the
note
coincidently
with
this
speech
of
the
chancellor
which
was
december
twelfth
the
emperor
sent
a
message
to
the
commanding
generals
reading
as
follows
soldiers
in
agreement
with
the
sovereigns
of
my
allies
and
with
the
consciousness
of
victory
i
have
made
an
offer
of
peace
to
the
enemy
whether
it
will
be
accepted
is
still
uncertain
until
that
moment
arrives
you
will
fight
on
i
return
to
the
president
note
the
president
suggested
that
early
occasion
be
sought
to
callout
from
all
the
nations
now
at
war
an
avowal
of
their
respective
views
as
to
the
terms
upon
which
the
war
might
be
concluded
and
the
arrangements
which
would
be
deemed
satisfactory
as
a
guarantee
against
its
renewal
he
called
the
attention
of
the
world
to
the
fact
that
according
to
the
statements
of
the
statesmen
of
the
belligerent
powers
the
objects
which
all
sides
had
in
mind
seemed
to
be
the
same
and
the
president
finally
said
that
he
was
not
proposing
peace
not
even
offering
mediation
but
merely
proposing
that
soundings
be
taken
in
order
that
all
nations
might
know
how
near
might
be
the
haven
of
peace
for
which
all
mankind
longed
shortly
after
the
publication
of
this
note
secretary
lansing
gave
an
interview
to
the
representatives
of
the
american
press
in
which
he
stated
that
america
was
very
near
war
this
interview
he
later
explained
as
soon
as
possible
after
my
return
to
berlin
i
had
interviews
with
zimmermann
and
the
chancellor
zimmermann
said
that
we
were
such
personal
friends
that
he
was
sure
we
could
continue
to
work
as
we
had
in
the
past
in
a
frank
and
open
manner
putting
all
the
cards
upon
the
table
and
working
together
in
the
interests
of
peace
i
of
course
agreed
to
this
and
it
seemed
on
the
surface
as
if
everything
would
go
smoothly
although
the
torpedoing
without
warning
of
the
while
i
was
in
the
united
states
had
resulted
in
the
death
of
a
number
of
americans
on
board
nevertheless
there
seemed
to
be
an
inclination
on
the
part
of
the
government
and
people
of
the
united
states
to
forget
this
incident
provided
germany
would
continue
to
keep
her
pledges
given
in
the
note
during
all
the
period
of
the
war
in
germany
i
had
been
on
good
terms
with
the
members
of
the
government
namely
the
chancellor
von
jagow
zimmermann
and
the
other
officials
of
the
foreign
office
as
well
as
with
helfferich
solf
the
colonial
minister
kaempf
the
president
of
the
reichstag
and
a
number
of
the
influential
men
of
germany
such
as
von
gwinner
of
the
deutsche
bank
gutmann
of
the
dresdener
bank
walter
rathenau
who
for
a
long
time
was
at
the
head
of
the
department
for
the
supply
and
conservation
of
raw
materials
general
von
kessel
of
the
mark
of
brandenburg
in
spite
of
many
tiffs
with
him
over
the
treatment
of
prisoners
theodor
wolff
editor
of
the
professor
stein
maximilian
harden
and
many
others
for
a
long
time
the
fight
waged
by
the
chancellor
was
fight
and
a
fight
for
peace
so
much
so
that
the
newspapers
which
attacked
the
chancellor
were
the
same
ones
which
had
attacked
president
wilson
america
and
americans
in
general
and
which
had
very
often
included
me
in
their
attacks
during
every
crisis
between
america
and
germany
i
had
acted
with
von
jagow
and
zimmermann
in
a
most
confidential
way
looking
forward
always
to
one
object
namely
the
preservation
of
peace
between
our
respective
countries
many
suggestions
were
made
which
i
think
materially
aided
up
to
that
time
in
the
preservation
of
peace
the
chancellor
and
the
foreign
office
however
through
sheer
weakness
did
nothing
to
prevent
the
insults
to
our
flag
and
president
perpetrated
by
the
league
of
truth
although
both
under
the
law
and
the
regulations
of
the
state
of
siege
this
gang
could
not
operate
without
the
consent
of
the
authorities
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
personally
a
few
extra
attacks
from
tooth
carpenters
and
snake
dancers
meant
nothing
but
certainly
aroused
my
interest
in
the
workings
of
the
teutonic
official
brain
on
my
return
everyone
in
official
life
the
chancellor
zimmermann
von
stumm
who
succeeded
zimmermann
von
der
busche
formerly
german
minister
in
the
argentine
who
had
equal
rank
with
stumm
in
the
foreign
office
all
without
exception
and
in
the
most
convincing
language
assured
me
that
cases
like
that
of
the
for
example
were
only
accidents
and
that
there
was
every
desire
on
the
part
of
germany
to
maintain
the
pledges
given
in
the
note
and
the
great
question
to
be
solved
is
whether
the
germans
in
making
their
offers
of
peace
in
begging
me
to
go
to
america
to
talk
peace
to
the
president
were
sincerely
anxious
for
peace
or
were
only
making
these
general
offers
of
peace
in
order
to
excuse
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
a
resumption
of
ruthless
submarine
warfare
and
to
win
to
their
side
public
opinion
in
the
united
states
in
case
such
warfare
should
be
resumed
had
the
decision
rested
with
the
chancellor
and
with
the
foreign
office
instead
of
with
the
military
i
am
sure
that
the
decision
would
have
been
against
the
resumption
of
this
ruthless
war
but
germany
is
not
ruled
in
war
time
by
the
civilian
power
hindenburg
at
the
time
i
left
for
america
was
at
the
head
of
the
general
staff
and
ludendorf
who
had
been
chief
of
staff
had
been
made
the
quartermaster
general
in
order
that
he
might
follow
hindenburg
to
general
headquarters
hindenburg
shortly
before
his
battle
of
the
masurian
lakes
was
a
general
living
in
retirement
at
hanover
because
he
had
for
years
specialised
in
the
study
of
this
region
he
was
suddenly
called
to
the
command
of
the
german
army
which
was
opposing
the
russian
invasions
ludendorf
who
had
been
colonel
of
a
regiment
at
the
attack
on
liège
was
sent
with
him
as
his
chief
of
staff
the
success
of
hindenburg
in
his
campaigns
is
too
well
known
to
require
recapitulation
here
he
became
the
popular
idol
of
germany
the
one
fact
the
one
man
whom
the
people
felt
that
they
could
idolise
but
shortly
before
my
trip
to
america
an
idea
was
creeping
through
the
mind
of
the
german
people
leading
them
to
believe
that
hindenburg
was
but
the
front
and
that
the
brains
of
the
combination
had
been
furnished
by
ludendorf
many
germans
in
a
position
to
know
told
me
that
the
real
dictator
of
germany
was
ludendorf
my
trip
to
america
was
made
principally
at
the
instance
of
von
jagow
and
the
chancellor
and
in
my
farewell
talk
with
the
chancellor
a
few
days
before
leaving
i
asked
if
it
could
not
be
arranged
since
he
was
always
saying
that
the
civilian
power
was
inferior
to
that
of
the
military
that
i
should
see
hindenburg
and
ludendorf
before
i
left
this
proposed
meeting
he
either
could
not
or
would
not
arrange
and
shortly
after
my
return
i
again
asked
the
chancellor
if
i
could
not
see
if
not
the
emperor
at
least
hindenburg
and
ludendorf
who
the
chancellor
himself
had
said
were
the
leaders
of
the
military
and
therefore
the
leaders
of
germany
again
i
was
put
off
in
the
meantime
and
in
spite
of
the
official
assurance
given
to
me
certain
men
in
germany
in
a
position
to
know
warned
me
that
the
government
intended
to
resume
ruthless
submarine
war
ludendorf
they
said
had
declared
in
favour
of
this
war
and
according
to
them
that
meant
its
adoption
at
first
i
thought
that
germany
would
approach
the
resumption
of
ruthless
submarine
war
the
armed
merchantman
issue
the
case
of
the
prisoners
seemed
to
bear
out
this
theory
a
german
raider
captured
and
sunk
a
number
of
enemy
vessels
and
sent
one
of
the
captured
boats
the
with
a
prize
crew
to
swinemunde
on
board
held
as
prisoners
were
a
number
of
the
crews
of
the
captured
vessels
and
among
those
men
i
learned
under
the
rose
were
some
americans
the
arrival
of
the
was
kept
secret
for
some
time
but
as
soon
as
i
received
information
of
its
arrival
i
sent
note
after
note
to
the
foreign
office
demanding
to
know
if
there
were
any
americans
among
the
prisoner
crews
for
a
long
time
i
received
no
answer
but
finally
germany
admitted
what
i
knew
already
that
americans
taken
with
the
crews
of
captured
ships
were
being
held
as
prisoners
of
war
the
theory
of
the
germans
being
that
all
employed
on
armed
enemy
merchant
ships
were
enemy
combatants
i
supposed
that
possibly
germany
might
therefore
approach
the
submarine
controversy
by
this
route
and
claim
that
armed
merchantmen
were
liable
to
be
sunk
without
notice
instructed
by
the
state
department
i
demanded
the
immediate
release
of
the
prisoners
this
was
accorded
by
germany
but
after
the
breaking
of
relations
the
prisoners
were
held
back
and
it
was
not
until
after
we
left
germany
that
they
were
finally
released
i
asked
permission
to
visit
these
prisoners
and
sent
ayrault
and
osborne
to
the
place
where
i
knew
they
were
interned
the
permission
to
visit
them
arrived
but
on
the
same
day
orders
were
given
to
remove
the
prisoners
to
other
camps
osborne
and
ayrault
however
being
on
the
ground
saw
the
prisoners
before
their
removal
and
reported
on
their
conditions
on
january
sixth
the
american
association
of
commerce
and
trade
gave
me
a
dinner
at
the
hotel
adlon
this
was
made
the
occasion
of
a
sort
of
zimmermann
although
he
had
to
go
early
in
the
evening
to
meet
the
foreign
minister
of
was
present
helfferich
and
secretary
of
the
interior
solf
the
colonial
minister
sydow
minister
of

of
the

the

and
the
police
president
of
berlin
the
president
of
the
berlin
chamber
of
commerce
under
secretary
von
stumm
of
the
foreign
office
and
many
others
of
that
office
there
were
present
also
under
secretary
richter
of
the
interior
department
lieutenant
colonel
doeutelmoser
of
the
general
staff
the
editors
and
proprietors
of
the
principal
newspapers
in
berlin
count
montgelas
who
had
charge
of
american
affairs
in
the
foreign
office
naval
officers
like
captain
lans
the
american
correspondents
in
germany
and
prince
isenburg
rubbing
shoulders
with
the
brewers
george
ehret
and
krueger
of
new
york
and
newark
there
were
literary
lights
like
ludwig
fulda
captain
persius
professor
hans
delbrück
paasche
of
the
reichstag
and
many
others
equally
celebrated
as
the
ones
that
i
have
named
speeches
were
made
by
wolf
president
of
the
american
association
of
commerce
and
trade
helfferich
zimmermann
von
gwinner
and
me
a
tone
of
the
greatest
friendliness
prevailed
zimmermann
referred
to
our
personal
friendship
and
said
that
he
was
sure
that
we
should
be
able
to
manage
everything
together
helfferich
in
his
speech
said
that
i
by
learning
german
and
studying
the
life
of
the
german
people
was
one
of
the
few
diplomats
that
had
come
to
germany
who
had
learned
something
of
the
real
life
and
psychology
of
the
germans
von
gwinner
made
a
speech
in
english
that
would
have
done
credit
to
any
american
speaker
and
i
in
my
short
address
said
that
the
relations
between
the
two
countries
had
never
been
better
and
that
so
long
as
my
personal
friends
like
zimmermann
and
other
members
of
the
government
who
i
named
were
in
office
i
was
sure
that
the
good
relations
between
the
two
countries
would
be
maintained
i
spoke
also
of
the
sums
of
money
that
i
had
brought
back
with
me
for
the
benefit
of
the
widows
and
orphans
of
germany
the
majority
of
the
german
newspapers
spoke
in
a
very
kindly
way
about
this
dinner
and
about
what
was
said
at
it
of
course
they
all
took
what
i
said
as
an
expression
of
friendliness
and
only
reventlow
claimed
that
by
referring
to
the
members
of
the
government
i
was
interfering
in
the
internal
affairs
of
germany
the
speeches
and
in
fact
this
dinner
constituted
a
last
desperate
attempt
to
preserve
friendly
relations
both
the
reasonable
men
present
and
i
knew
almost
to
a
certainty
that
return
to
ruthless
submarine
war
had
been
decided
on
and
that
only
some
lucky
chance
could
prevent
the
military
backed
by
the
made
public
opinion
from
insisting
on
a
defiance
of
international
law
and
the
laws
of
humanity
the
day
after
the
dinner
the
chancellor
sent
for
me
and
expressed
approval
of
what
i
said
and
thanked
me
for
it
and
on
the
surface
it
seemed
as
if
everything
was
as
merry
as
a
marriage
bell
unfortunately
i
am
afraid
that
all
this
was
only
on
the
surface
and
that
perhaps
the
orders
to
the
submarine
commanders
to
recommence
ruthless
war
had
been
given
the
day
preceding
this
the
germans
believed
that
president
wilson
had
been
elected
with
a
mandate
to
keep
out
of
war
at
any
cost
and
that
america
could
be
insulted
flouted
and
humiliated
with
impunity
even
before
this
dinner
we
had
begun
to
get
rumours
of
the
resumption
of
ruthless
submarine
war
and
within
a
few
days
i
was
cabling
to
the
department
information
based
not
upon
absolute
facts
but
upon
reports
which
seemed
reliable
and
which
had
been
collected
through
the
able
efforts
of
our
very
capable
naval
attaché
commander
gherardi
and
this
information
was
confirmed
by
the
hints
given
to
me
by
various
influential
germans
again
and
again
after
the
sixth
of
january
i
was
assured
by
zimmermann
and
others
in
the
foreign
office
that
nothing
of
the
kind
was
contemplated
now
were
the
german
moves
in
the
direction
of
peace
sincere
or
not
from
the
time
when
the
chancellor
first
spoke
of
peace
i
asked
him
and
others
what
the
peace
terms
of
germany
were
i
could
never
get
any
one
to
state
any
definite
terms
of
peace
and
on
several
occasions
when
i
asked
the
chancellor
whether
germany
was
willing
to
withdraw
from
belgium
he
always
said
yes
but
with
guarantees
finally
in
january
when
he
was
again
talking
of
peace
i
said
what
are
these
peace
terms
to
which
you
refer
continually
will
you
allow
me
to
ask
a
few
questions
as
to
the
specific
terms
of
peace
first
are
the
germans
willing
to
withdraw
from
belgium
the
chancellor
answered
yes
but
with
guarantees
i
said
what
are
these
guarantees
he
said
we
must
possibly
have
the
forts
of
liege
and
namur
we
must
have
other
forts
and
garrisons
throughout
belgium
we
must
have
possession
of
the
railroad
lines
we
must
have
possession
of
the
ports
and
other
means
of
communication
the
belgians
will
not
be
allowed
to
maintain
an
army
but
we
must
be
allowed
to
retain
a
large
army
in
belgium
we
must
have
the
commercial
control
of
belgium
i
said
i
do
not
see
that
you
have
left
much
for
the
belgians
except
that
king
albert
will
have
the
right
to
reside
in
brussels
with
an
honor
guard
and
the
chancellor
said
we
can
not
allow
belgium
to
be
an
outpost
of
england
and
i
said
i
do
not
suppose
the
english
on
the
other
hand
wish
it
to
become
an
outpost
of
germany
especially
as
von
tirpitz
has
said
that
the
coast
of
flanders
should
be
retained
in
order
to
make
war
on
england
and
america
i
continued
how
about
northern
france
he
said
we
are
willing
to
leave
northern
france
but
there
must
be
a
rectification
of
the
frontier
i
said
how
about
the
eastern
frontier
he
said
we
must
have
a
very
substantial
rectification
of
our
frontier
i
said
how
about
roumania
he
said
we
shall
leave
bulgaria
to
deal
with
roumania
i
said
how
about
serbia
he
said
a
very
small
serbia
may
be
allowed
to
exist
but
that
is
a
question
for
austria
austria
must
be
left
to
do
what
she
wishes
to
italy
and
we
must
have
indemnities
from
all
countries
and
all
our
ships
and
colonies
back
of
course
rectification
of
the
frontier
is
a
polite
term
for
annexation
on
the
of
january
our
president
addressed
the
senate
and
in
his
address
he
referred
to
his
note
of
the
eighteenth
of
december
sent
to
all
belligerent
governments
in
this
address
he
stated
referring
to
the
reply
of
the
entente
powers
to
his
peace
note
of
the
eighteenth
of
december
we
are
that
much
nearer
to
the
definite
discussion
of
the
peace
which
shall
end
the
present
war
he
referred
to
the
willingness
of
both
contestants
to
discuss
terms
of
peace
as
follows
the
central
powers
united
in
reply
which
stated
merely
that
they
were
ready
to
meet
their
antagonists
in
conference
to
discuss
terms
of
peace
the
entente
powers
have
replied
much
more
definitely
and
have
stated
in
general
terms
indeed
but
with
sufficient
definiteness
to
imply
details
the
arrangements
guarantees
and
acts
of
reparation
which
they
deem
to
be
the
indispensable
conditions
of
a
satisfactory
settlement
we
are
that
much
nearer
a
definite
discussion
of
the
peace
which
shall
end
the
present
war
the
president
further
referred
to
a
world
concert
to
guarantee
peace
in
the
future
and
said
the
present
war
must
first
be
ended
but
we
owe
it
to
candour
and
to
a
just
regard
for
the
opinion
of
mankind
to
say
that
so
far
as
our
participation
in
guarantees
of
future
peace
is
concerned
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
in
what
way
and
upon
what
terms
it
is
ended
he
said
that
the
statesmen
of
both
of
the
groups
of
nations
at
war
had
stated
that
it
was
not
part
of
the
purpose
they
had
in
mind
to
crush
their
antagonists
and
he
said
that
it
must
be
implied
from
these
assurances
that
the
peace
to
come
must
be
a
peace
without
victory
in
the
course
of
his
address
he
said
statesmen
everywhere
are
agreed
that
there
should
be
a
united
independent
and
autonomous
poland
in
another
place
he
said
so
far
as
practicable
moreover
every
great
people
now
struggling
toward
a
full
development
of
its
resources
and
its
powers
should
be
assured
a
direct
outlet
to
the
highways
of
the
sea
where
this
can
not
be
done
by
cession
of
territory
it
can
no
doubt
be
arranged
by
the
neutralisation
of
direct
rights
of
way
and
he
closed
by
proposing
in
effect
that
the
nations
of
the
world
should
adopt
the
monroe
doctrine
and
that
no
nation
should
seek
to
explain
its
policy
for
any
other
nation
or
people
after
the
receipt
of
the
ultimatum
of
january
from
germany
the
chancellor
in
a
conversation
i
had
with
him
referred
to
this
peace
note
of
december
eighteenth
and
to
the
speech
of
january
illustration
a
poster
from
the
charleville
district
showing
the
allotment
of
food
to
each
person
for
the
first
fifteen
days
of
may
i
must
say
here
that
on
my
return
to
germany
i
went
very
far
in
assuring
the
chancellor
and
other
members
of
the
government
of
the
president
desire
to
see
peace
established
in
the
world
and
i
told
them
that
i
believed
that
the
president
was
ready
to
go
very
far
in
the
way
of
coercing
any
nation
which
refused
a
reasonable
peace
but
i
also
impressed
on
all
the
members
of
the
government
with
whom
i
came
in
contact
my
belief
that
the
election
had
not
in
any
way
altered
the
policy
of
the
president
and
i
warned
them
of
the
danger
to
our
good
relations
if
ruthless
submarine
warfare
should
be
resumed
von
however
at
this
interview
after
the
of
january
said
that
he
had
been
compelled
to
take
up
ruthless
submarine
war
because
it
was
evident
that
president
wilson
could
do
nothing
towards
peace
he
spoke
particularly
of
the
president
speech
of
january
and
said
that
in
that
speech
the
president
had
made
it
plain
that
he
considered
that
the
answer
of
the
entente
powers
to
his
peace
note
formed
a
basis
for
peace
which
was
a
thing
impossible
for
germany
even
to
consider
and
said
further
and
this
was
a
criticism
i
heard
not
only
from
him
but
also
from
many
germans
that
when
the
president
spoke
of
a
united
and
independent
poland
he
evidently
meant
to
take
away
from
germany
that
part
of
poland
which
had
been
incorporated
in
the
kingdom
of
prussia
and
give
it
to
this
new
and
independent
kingdom
thereby
bringing
the
eastern
frontier
of
germany
within
two
hours
by
motor
from
berlin
and
that
further
when
the
president
spoke
of
giving
each
nation
a
highway
to
the
sea
he
meant
that
the
german
port
of
dantzig
should
be
turned
over
to
this
new
state
of
poland
thereby
not
only
taking
a
prussian
port
but
cutting
the
extreme
eastern
part
of
prussia
from
the
remainder
of
the
country
i
said
that
these
objections
appeared
to
me
very
frivolous
that
the
president
of
course
like
a
clever
lawyer
endeavouring
to
gain
his
end
which
was
peace
had
said
that
all
parties
were
apparently
agreed
that
there
should
be
a
peace
that
if
germany
were
fighting
a
merely
defensive
war
as
she
had
always
claimed
she
should
be
greatly
delighted
when
the
president
declared
that
all
the
weight
of
america
was
in
favor
of
a
peace
without
victory
which
meant
of
course
that
germany
should
be
secured
from
that
crushing
and
dismemberment
which
germany
statesmen
had
stated
so
often
that
they
feared
i
said
further
that
i
was
sure
that
when
the
president
spoke
of
the
united
and
independent
state
of
poland
he
had
not
of
course
had
reference
to
poland
at
any
particular
period
of
its
history
but
undoubtedly
to
poland
as
constituted
by
germany
and
austria
themselves
and
that
in
referring
to
the
right
of
a
nation
to
have
access
to
the
sea
he
had
in
mind
russia
and
the
dardanelles
rather
than
to
any
attempt
to
take
a
prussian
port
for
the
benefit
of
poland
von
said
that
one
of
the
principal
reasons
why
germany
had
determined
upon
a
resumption
of
ruthless
submarine
warfare
was
because
of
this
speech
of
the
president
to
the
american
senate
of
course
the
trouble
with
this
feeling
and
the
criticism
of
the
president
speech
made
by
the
chancellor
is
that
the
orders
for
the
resumption
of
ruthless
submarine
warfare
had
been
given
long
before
the
news
of
the
speech
came
to
germany
i
had
cabled
the
information
collected
by
commander
gherardi
as
to
the
orders
given
to
submarines
long
before
the
date
of
the
president
speech
and
it
happened
that
on
the
night
after
i
had
received
the
german
note
announcing
this
resumption
i
was
taking
a
walk
after
dinner
about
the
streets
of
berlin
in
the
course
of
this
walk
i
met
a
young
german
woman
of
my
acquaintance
who
was
on
intimate
terms
with
the
crown
princess
she
was
on
her
way
on
foot
from
the
opera
house
where
she
had
been
with
the
crown
princess
to
the
underground
station
for
by
this
time
of
course
taxis
had
become
an
unknown
luxury
in
berlin
and
i
joined
her
i
told
her
of
the
ultimatum
which
i
had
received
at
six
that
evening
from
zimmermann
and
i
told
her
that
i
was
sure
that
it
meant
the
breaking
of
diplomatic
relations
and
our
departure
from
germany
she
expressed
great
surprise
that
the
submarine
warfare
was
set
to
commence
on
the
of
january
and
said
that
weeks
before
they
had
been
talking
over
the
matter
at
the
crown
princess
and
that
she
had
heard
then
that
the
orders
had
been
given
to
commence
it
on
the
fifteenth
in
any
event
it
is
certain
that
the
orders
to
the
submarine
commanders
had
been
given
long
prior
to
the
and
probably
as
early
as
the
fifteenth
i
sincerely
believe
that
the
only
object
of
the
germans
in
making
these
peace
offers
was
first
to
get
the
allies
if
possible
in
a
conference
and
there
detach
some
or
one
of
them
by
the
offer
of
separate
terms
or
if
this
scheme
failed
then
it
was
believed
that
the
general
offer
and
talk
about
peace
would
create
a
sentiment
so
favourable
to
the
germans
that
they
might
without
fear
of
action
by
the
united
states
resume
ruthless
submarine
warfare
against
england
a
week
or
two
before
the
of
january
solf
asked
me
if
i
did
not
think
that
it
would
be
possible
for
the
united
states
to
permit
the
resumption
of
ruthless
submarine
warfare
against
great
britain
he
said
that
three
months
time
was
all
that
would
be
required
to
bring
great
britain
to
her
knees
and
end
the
war
and
in
fact
so
cleverly
did
von
tirpitz
grand
admiral
von
meuster
the
conservatives
and
the
enemies
of
the
chancellor
and
other
advocates
of
submarine
war
carry
on
their
propaganda
that
the
belief
was
ingrained
in
the
whole
of
the
german
nation
that
a
resumption
of
this
ruthless
war
would
lead
within
three
months
to
what
all
germans
so
ardently
desired
peace
it
was
impossible
for
any
government
to
resist
the
popular
demand
for
the
use
of
this
illegal
means
of
warfare
because
army
and
navy
and
people
were
convinced
that
ruthless
submarine
war
spelled
success
and
a
glorious
peace
but
this
peace
of
course
meant
only
a
german
peace
a
peace
as
outlined
to
me
by
the
chancellor
a
peace
impossible
for
the
allies
and
even
for
the
world
to
accept
a
peace
which
would
leave
germany
immensely
powerful
and
ready
immediately
after
the
war
to
take
up
a
campaign
against
the
nations
of
the
western
hemisphere
a
peace
which
would
compel
every
nation
so
long
as
german
autocracy
remained
in
the
saddle
to
devote
its
best
energies
the
most
fruitful
period
of
each
man
life
to
preparations
for
war
on
january
thirtieth
i
received
a
definite
intimation
of
the
coming
ultimatum
the
next
day
and
judging
that
the
hint
meant
the
resumption
of
ruthless
submarine
war
i
telegraphed
a
warning
to
the
american
ambassadors
and
ministers
as
well
as
to
the
state
department
on
january
at
about
four
in
the
afternoon
i
received
from
zimmermann
a
short
letter
of
which
the
following
is
a
copy
the
secretary
of
state
of
the
foreign
office
zimmermann
requests
the
honor
of
the
visit
of
his
excellency
the
ambassador
of
the
united
states
of
america
this
afternoon
at
six
in
the
foreign
office
wilhelmstrasse
berlin
the
january
pursuant
to
this
letter
i
went
to
the
foreign
office
at
six
zimmermann
then
read
to
me
in
german
a
note
from
the
imperial
government
announcing
the
creation
of
the
war
zones
about
great
britain
and
france
and
the
commencement
of
ruthless
submarine
warfare
at
twelve
that
night
i
made
no
comment
put
the
note
in
my
pocket
and
went
back
to
the
embassy
it
was
then
about
seven
and
of
course
the
note
was
immediately
translated
and
despatched
with
all
speed
to
america
after
the
despatch
of
the
note
i
had
an
interview
with
the
chancellor
in
which
he
as
i
have
stated
above
criticised
both
the
peace
note
of
december
eighteenth
as
not
being
definite
enough
and
the
speech
to
the
senate
of
january
and
further
said
that
he
believed
that
the
situation
had
changed
that
in
spite
of
what
the
president
had
said
in
the
note
before
the
settlement
he
was
now
for
peace
that
he
had
been
elected
on
a
peace
platform
and
that
nothing
would
happen
zimmermann
at
the
time
he
delivered
the
note
told
me
that
this
submarine
warfare
was
a
necessity
for
germany
and
that
germany
could
not
hold
out
a
year
on
the
question
of
food
he
further
said
give
us
only
two
months
of
this
kind
of
warfare
and
we
shall
end
the
war
and
make
peace
within
three
months
saturday
february
third
the
president
announced
to
congress
the
breaking
of
diplomatic
relations
with
germany
the
news
of
this
of
course
did
not
reach
berlin
until
the
next
day
and
on
this
saturday
afternoon
gerard
and
i
had
an
engagement
to
go
to
the
theatre
with
zimmermann
and
a
young
lady
whose
father
is
considered
the
richest
man
in
berlin
and
who
had
been
married
to
a
young
englishman
named
mitford
a
son
of
lord
redesdale
through
no
fault
on
the
lady
part
there
had
been
an
annulment
of
this
marriage
and
she
was
occupying
a
floor
of
her
own
in
the
handsome
house
of
her
father
and
mother
on
the
in
berlin
we
stopped
for
mitford
and
took
her
to
the
theatre
where
we
saw
a
very
clever
play
i
think
by
thoma
called
die
verlorene
tochter
the
prodigal
daughter
zimmermann
did
not
come
to
the
play
but
joined
us
later
at
the
house
where
we
had
a
supper
of
four
in
mitford
apartments
after
supper
while
i
was
talking
to
zimmermann
he
spoke
of
the
note
to
america
and
said
during
the
past
month
this
is
what
i
have
been
doing
so
often
at
the
general
headquarters
with
the
emperor
i
often
thought
of
telling
you
what
was
going
on
as
i
used
to
tell
you
in
the
old
days
but
i
thought
that
you
would
only
say
that
such
a
course
would
mean
a
break
of
diplomatic
relations
and
so
i
thought
there
was
no
use
in
telling
you
but
as
you
will
see
everything
will
be
all
right
america
will
do
nothing
for
president
wilson
is
for
peace
and
nothing
else
everything
will
go
on
as
before
i
have
arranged
for
you
to
go
to
the
great
general
headquarters
and
see
the
kaiser
next
week
and
everything
will
be
all
right
the
next
day
sunday
we
had
a
german
who
is
connected
with
the
foreign
office
and
his
american
wife
to
lunch
and
another
german
who
had
been
in
america
also
connected
with
the
foreign
office
just
as
we
were
going
in
to
lunch
some
one
produced
a
copy
of
the
the
noon
paper
published
in
berlin
which
contained
what
seemed
to
be
an
authentic
account
of
the
breaking
of
diplomatic
relations
by
america
the
lunch
was
far
from
cheerful
the
germans
looked
very
sad
and
said
practically
nothing
while
i
tried
to
make
polite
conversation
at
my
end
of
the
table
the
next
day
i
went
over
to
see
zimmermann
having
that
morning
received
the
official
despatch
from
washington
and
told
him
that
i
had
come
to
demand
my
passports
of
course
zimmermann
by
that
time
had
received
the
news
and
had
had
time
to
compose
himself
the
american
correspondents
told
me
that
when
he
saw
them
on
the
day
before
he
had
at
first
refused
to
say
anything
and
then
had
been
rather
violent
in
his
language
and
had
finally
shown
great
emotion
i
am
sure
from
everything
i
observed
that
the
break
of
diplomatic
relations
came
as
an
intense
surprise
to
him
and
to
the
other
members
of
the
government
and
yet
i
can
not
imagine
why
intelligent
men
should
think
that
the
united
states
of
america
had
fallen
so
low
as
to
bear
without
murmur
this
sudden
kick
in
the
face
the
police
who
had
always
been
about
our
embassy
since
the
commencement
of
the
war
were
now
greatly
increased
in
numbers
and
guarded
not
only
the
front
of
the
house
but
also
the
rear
and
the
surrounding
streets
but
there
was
no
demonstration
whatever
on
the
part
of
the
people
of
berlin
on
tuesday
afternoon
i
went
out
for
a
walk
walking
through
most
of
the
principal
streets
of
berlin
absolutely
alone
and
on
my
return
to
the
embassy
i
found
count
montgelas
who
with
the
rank
of
minister
was
at
the
head
of
the
department
which
included
american
affairs
in
the
foreign
office
i
asked
montgelas
why
i
had
not
received
my
passports
and
he
said
that
i
was
being
kept
back
because
the
imperial
government
did
not
know
what
had
happened
to
count
bernstorff
and
that
there
had
been
rumours
that
the
german
ships
in
america
had
been
confiscated
by
our
government
i
said
that
i
was
quite
sure
that
bernstorff
was
being
treated
with
every
courtesy
and
that
the
german
ships
had
not
been
confiscated
i
said
moreover
i
do
not
see
why
i
have
to
disprove
your
idea
that
bernstorff
is
being
maltreated
and
the
german
ships
confiscated
it
seems
to
me
it
is
for
you
to
prove
this
and
at
any
event
why
do
you
have
the
swiss
government
which
now
represents
you
cable
to
its
minister
in
washington
and
get
the
exact
facts
he
said
well
you
know
the
swiss
are
not
used
to
cabling
he
then
produced
a
paper
which
was
a
of
the
treaty
between
prussia
and
the
united
states
of
with
some
very
extraordinary
clauses
added
to
it
he
asked
me
to
read
this
over
and
either
to
sign
it
or
to
get
authority
to
sign
it
and
said
that
if
it
was
not
signed
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
americans
to
leave
the
country
particularly
the
american
correspondents
i
read
this
treaty
over
and
then
said
of
course
i
can
not
sign
this
on
my
own
responsibility
and
i
will
not
cable
to
my
government
unless
i
can
cable
in
cipher
and
give
them
my
opinion
of
this
document
he
said
that
is
impossible
this
treaty
was
as
follows
agreement
between
germany
and
the
united
states
of
america

the
treatment

exercise
of
the
right
of
capture
in
maritime
war
shall
apply
to
the
captains
officers
and
members
of
the
crews
of
merchant
ships
specified
in
article
and
of
such
merchant
ships
that
may
be
captured
in
the
course
of
a
possible
war
this
agreement
shall
apply
also
to
the
colonies
and
other
foreign
possessions
of
either
party
berlin
february
i
then
said
i
shall
not
cable
at
all
why
do
you
come
to
me
with
a
proposed
treaty
after
we
have
broken
diplomatic
relations
and
ask
an
ambassador
who
is
held
as
a
prisoner
to
sign
it
prisoners
do
not
sign
treaties
and
treaties
signed
by
them
would
not
be
worth
anything
and
i
also
said
after
your
threat
to
keep
americans
here
and
after
reading
this
document
even
if
i
had
authority
to
sign
it
i
would
stay
here
until
hell
freezes
over
before
i
would
put
my
name
to
such
a
paper
montgelas
seemed
rather
rattled
and
in
his
confusion
left
the
paper
with
me
something
i
am
sure
he
did
not
intend
to
do
in
case
of
a
refusal
montgelas
was
an
extremely
agreeable
man
and
i
think
at
all
times
had
correctly
predicted
the
attitude
of
america
and
had
been
against
acts
of
frightfulness
such
as
the
torpedoing
of
the
and
the
resumption
of
ruthless
submarine
war
i
am
sure
that
a
gentleman
like
montgelas
undertook
with
great
reluctance
to
carry
out
his
orders
in
the
matter
of
getting
me
to
sign
this
treaty
i
must
cheerfully
certify
that
even
the
most
american
correspondents
in
berlin
when
i
told
them
of
montgelas
threat
showed
the
same
fine
spirit
as
their
colleagues
all
begged
me
not
to
consider
them
or
their
liberty
where
the
interests
of
america
were
involved
as
soon
as
diplomatic
relations
were
broken
and
i
broke
them
formally
not
only
in
my
conversation
with
zimmermann
of
monday
morning
but
also
by
sending
over
a
formal
written
request
for
my
passports
on
the
evening
of
that
day
our
telegraph
privileges
were
cut
off
i
was
not
even
allowed
to
send
telegrams
to
the
american
consuls
throughout
germany
giving
them
their
instructions
mail
also
was
cut
off
and
the
telephone
my
servants
were
not
even
permitted
to
go
to
the
nearby
hotel
to
telephone
in
the
meantime
we
completed
our
preparations
for
departure
we
arranged
to
turn
over
american
interests
and
the
interests
of
roumania
and
serbia
and
japan
to
the
spanish
embassy
and
the
interests
of
great
britain
to
the
dutch
i
have
said
already
that
i
believe
that
ambassador
polo
de
bernabe
will
faithfully
protect
the
interests
of
america
and
i
believe
that
baron
gevers
will
fearlessly
fight
the
cause
of
the
british
prisoners
we
sold
our
automobiles
and
two
beautiful
prize
winning
saddle
horses
one
from
kentucky
and
one
from
virginia
which
i
had
brought
with
me
from
america
went
on
the
stage
that
is
i
sold
them
to
the
proprietor
of
the
circus
in
berlin
the
three
tons
of
food
which
we
had
brought
with
us
from
america
we
gave
to
our
colleagues
in
the
diplomatic
corps
the
spaniards
greeks
dutch
and
the
central
and
south
americans
i
had
many
friends
among
the
diplomats
of
the
two
americas
who
were
all
men
of
great
ability
and
position
in
their
own
country
i
think
that
most
of
them
know
only
too
well
the
designs
against
central
and
south
america
cherished
by
the
finally
i
think
on
the
morning
of
friday
oscar
king
davis
correspondent
of
the
york
received
a
wireless
from
van
anda
editor
of
the
york
telling
him
that
bernstorff
and
his
staff
were
being
treated
with
every
courtesy
and
that
the
german
ships
had
not
been
confiscated
in
the
evening
our
telephone
was
reconnected
and
we
were
allowed
to
receive
some
telegrams
and
to
send
open
telegrams
to
the
consuls
etc
throughout
germany
and
we
were
notified
that
we
would
probably
be
allowed
to
leave
the
next
day
in
the
evening
always
followed
by
spies
i
paid
as
many
farewell
visits
to
my
diplomatic
colleagues
as
i
was
able
to
see
and
on
saturday
i
thought
that
in
spite
of
the
ridiculous
treatment
accorded
us
in
cutting
off
the
mail
and
telephone
and
in
holding
me
for
nearly
a
week
i
would
leave
in
a
sporting
spirit
i
therefore
had
my
servant
telephone
and
ask
whether
zimmermann
and
von
would
receive
me
i
had
a
pleasant
farewell
talk
of
about
half
an
hour
with
each
of
them
and
i
expressly
told
the
chancellor
that
i
had
come
to
bid
him
a
personal
farewell
not
to
make
a
record
for
any
white
book
and
that
anything
he
said
would
remain
confidential
i
also
stopped
in
to
thank
zahn
of
the
foreign
office
who
had
arranged
the
details
of
our
departure
and
gave
him
a
gold
cigarette
case
as
a
souvenir
of
the
occasion
at
the
last
moment
the
germans
allowed
a
number
of
the
consuls
and
clerks
who
had
been
working
in
the
embassy
and
the
american
residents
in
berlin
to
leave
on
the
train
with
us
so
that
we
were
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
persons
in
all
on
this
train
which
left
the
potsdamer
station
at
in
the
evening
the
time
of
our
departure
had
not
been
publicly
announced
but
although
the
automobiles
etc
in
front
of
the
embassy
might
have
attracted
a
crowd
there
was
no
demonstration
whatever
and
in
fact
during
this
week
that
i
was
detained
in
berlin
i
walked
allover
the
city
every
afternoon
and
evening
went
into
shops
and
so
on
without
encountering
any
hostile
demonstration
there
was
a
large
crowd
in
the
station
to
see
us
off
all
the
spanish
embassy
dutch
greeks
and
many
of
our
colleagues
from
central
and
south
america
were
there
there
were
from
the
foreign
office
montgelas
roediger
prittwitz
and
horstmann
as
the
train
pulled
out
a
number
of
the
americans
left
in
berlin
who
were
on
the
station
platform
raised
quite
a
vigorous
cheer
two
officers
had
been
sent
by
the
imperial
government
to
accompany
us
on
this
train
one
a
major
von
der
hagen
sent
by
the
general
staff
and
the
other
a
representative
of
the
foreign
office
baron
wernher
von
it
was
quite
thoughtful
of
the
foreign
office
to
send
this
last
officer
as
it
was
by
our
efforts
that
he
had
secured
his
exchange
when
he
was
a
prisoner
in
england
and
he
therefore
would
be
supposed
to
entertain
kindly
feelings
for
our
embassy
i
had
ordered
plenty
of
champagne
and
cigars
to
be
put
on
the
train
and
we
were
first
invited
to
drink
champagne
with
the
officers
in
the
dining
car
then
they
joined
us
in
the
private
salon
car
which
we
occupied
in
the
end
of
the
train
the
journey
was
uneventful
outside
some
of
the
stations
a
number
of
people
were
drawn
up
who
stared
at
the
train
in
a
bovine
way
but
who
made
no
demonstration
of
any
kind
we
went
through
württemburg
and
entered
switzerland
by
way
of
schaffhausen
the
two
officers
left
us
at
the
last
stop
on
the
german
side
i
had
taken
the
precaution
before
we
left
berlin
to
find
out
their
names
and
as
they
left
us
i
gave
each
of
them
a
gold
cigarette
case
inscribed
with
his
name
and
the
date
at
the
first
station
on
the
swiss
side
a
body
of
swiss
troops
were
drawn
up
presenting
arms
and
the
colonel
commanding
the
swiss
army
there
are
no
generals
in
switzerland
attended
by
several
staff
officers
came
on
the
train
and
travelled
with
us
nearly
to
zurich
i
started
to
speak
french
to
one
of
these
staff
officers
but
he
interrupted
me
by
saying
in
perfect
english
you
do
not
have
to
speak
french
to
me
my
name
is
iselin
many
of
my
relations
live
in
new
york
and
i
lived
there
myself
some
years
at
zurich
we
left
the
german
special
train
and
were
met
on
the
platform
by
some
grateful
japanese
the
american
consul
and
a
number
of
french
and
swiss
newspaper
reporters
thus
ending
our
exodus
from
germany
chapter
xviii
liberals
and
reasonable
men
i
have
already
expressed
a
belief
that
germany
will
not
be
forced
to
make
peace
because
of
a
revolution
and
that
sufficient
food
will
be
somehow
found
to
carry
the
population
during
at
least
another
year
of
war
what
then
offers
a
prospect
of
reasonable
peace
supposing
of
course
that
the
germans
fail
in
the
submarine
blockade
of
england
and
that
the
crumbling
up
of
russia
does
not
release
from
the
east
frontier
soldiers
enough
to
break
the
lines
of
the
british
and
french
in
france
i
think
that
it
is
only
by
an
evolution
of
germany
herself
toward
liberalism
that
the
world
will
be
given
such
guarantees
of
future
peace
as
will
justify
the
termination
of
this
war
there
is
properly
speaking
no
great
liberal
party
in
the
political
arena
in
germany
as
i
have
said
the
reichstag
is
divided
roughly
into
conservatives
roman
catholics
or
centrum
and
social
democrats
the
national
liberal
party
has
in
this
war
shown
itself
a
branch
of
the
conservative
party
and
on
some
issues
as
bitter
as
conservative
as
the
junkers
themselves
herr
bassermann
and
herr
stresemann
have
not
shown
themselves
leaders
of
liberal
thought
nor
has
their
leadership
been
such
as
to
inspire
confidence
in
their
political
sagacity
it
was
stresemann
who
on
may
thirtieth
said
in
the
reichstag
referring
to
president
wilson
as
a
peacemaker
we
thrust
the
hand
of
wilson
aside
on
the
day
following
the
day
on
which
the
president
announced
to
congress
the
breaking
of
diplomatic
relations
news
of
that
break
had
not
yet
arrived
in
berlin
and
herr
stresemann
on
that
peaceful
sunday
morning
was
engaged
in
making
a
speech
to
the
members
of
the
national
liberal
party
in
which
he
told
them
that
as
a
result
of
his
careful
study
of
the
american
situation
of
his
careful
researches
into
american
character
and
politics
he
could
assure
them
that
america
would
never
break
with
germany
as
he
concluded
his
speech
and
sat
down
amid
the
applause
of
his
admirers
a
german
who
had
been
sitting
in
the
back
of
the
room
rose
and
read
from
the
noon
paper
the
a
despatch
from
holland
giving
the
news
that
america
had
broken
relations
with
germany
the
political
skill
and
foresight
of
herr
stresemann
may
be
judged
from
the
above
incident
the
socialists
or
social
democrats
more
properly
speaking
have
shown
themselves
in
opposition
to
the
monarchical
form
of
government
in
germany
this
has
put
them
politically
militarily
and
socially
beyond
the
pale
after
a
successful
french
attack
in
the
champagne
i
heard
it
said
of
a
german
woman
whose
husband
was
thought
to
be
killed
that
her
rage
and
despair
had
been
so
great
that
she
had
said
she
would
become
a
social
democrat
and
her
expression
was
repeated
as
showing
to
what
lengths
grief
had
driven
her
this
girl
was
the
wife
of
an
ordinary
clerk
working
in
berlin
the
social
democrats
are
not
given
offices
are
not
given
titles
they
never
join
the
class
of
and
they
can
not
hope
to
become
officers
of
the
army
did
not
lieutenant
forstner
the
notorious
centre
of
the
zabern
affair
promise
a
reward
to
the
first
one
of
his
men
who
in
case
of
trouble
should
shoot
one
of
those
damn
social
democrats
there
is
therefore
no
refuge
at
present
politically
for
the
reasonable
men
of
liberal
inclinations
and
it
is
these
liberal
men
who
must
themselves
create
a
liberal
party
a
party
membership
in
which
will
not
entail
a
loss
of
business
a
loss
of
prospects
of
promotion
and
social
degradation
there
are
many
such
men
in
germany
perhaps
some
of
the
conservative
socialists
will
join
such
a
party
and
there
are
men
in
the
government
itself
whose
habits
of
mind
and
thought
are
not
incompatible
with
membership
in
a
liberal
organisation
the
chancellor
himself
is
perhaps
at
heart
a
liberal
he
comes
of
a
banking
family
in
frankfort
and
while
there
stands
before
his
name
the
von
which
means
nobility
and
while
he
owns
a
country
estate
the
whole
turn
of
his
thought
is
towards
a
philosophical
liberalism
zimmermann
the
foreign
secretary
although
the
mental
excitement
caused
by
his
elevation
to
the
foreign
office
at
a
time
of
stress
made
him
go
over
to
the
advocates
of
ruthless
submarine
war
lock
stock
and
barrel
is
nevertheless
at
heart
a
liberal
and
violently
opposed
to
a
system
which
draws
the
leaders
of
the
country
from
only
one
aristocratic
class
solf
the
imperial
colonial
minister
while
devoted
to
the
emperor
and
his
family
is
a
man
so
reasonable
in
his
views
so
indulgent
of
the
views
of
others
and
indulgent
without
weakness
that
he
would
make
an
ideal
leader
of
a
liberalised
germany
the
great
bankers
merchants
and
manufacturers
although
they
appreciate
the
luscious
dividends
that
they
have
received
during
the
peaceful
years
since
nevertheless
feel
under
their
skins
the
ignominy
of
living
in
a
country
where
a
class
exists
by
birth
a
class
not
even
tactful
enough
to
conceal
its
ancient
contempt
for
all
those
who
soil
their
hands
business
or
trade
in
fact
such
a
party
is
a
necessity
for
germany
as
a
buffer
against
the
extreme
social
democrats
at
the
close
of
the
war
the
soldiers
who
have
fought
in
the
mud
of
the
trenches
for
three
years
will
most
insistently
demand
a
redistricting
of
the
reichstag
and
an
abolition
of
the
inadequate
circle
voting
of
prussia
and
when
manhood
suffrage
comes
in
prussia
and
when
the
industrial
population
of
germany
gets
that
representation
in
the
reichstag
out
of
which
they
have
been
brazenly
cheated
for
so
many
years
it
may
well
be
that
a
great
liberal
party
will
be
the
only
defence
of
private
property
against
the
assault
of
an
enraged
and
justly
revengeful
social
democracy
the
workingmen
of
germany
have
been
fooled
for
a
long
time
they
constitute
that
class
of
which
president
lincoln
spoke
you
can
fool
some
of
the
people
all
of
the
time
and
the
middle
class
of
manufacturers
merchants
etc
have
acquiesced
in
the
system
because
of
the
profits
that
they
have
made
the
difficulty
of
making
peace
with
germany
as
at
present
constituted
is
that
the
whole
world
feels
that
peace
made
with
its
present
government
would
not
be
lasting
that
such
a
peace
would
mean
the
detachment
of
some
of
the
allies
from
the
present
world
alliance
against
germany
preparation
by
germany
in
the
light
of
her
needs
as
disclosed
by
this
war
and
the
declaration
of
a
new
war
in
which
there
would
be
no
battle
of
the
marne
to
turn
back
the
tide
of
german
world
conquest
for
a
long
time
before
this
war
radicals
in
great
britain
pinned
a
great
faith
to
the
socialist
party
of
germany
how
little
that
faith
was
justified
appeared
in
july
and
august
of
when
the
socialist
party
tamely
voted
credits
for
the
war
a
war
declared
by
the
emperor
on
the
mere
statement
that
it
was
a
defensive
war
declared
because
it
was
alleged
that
certain
invasions
of
german
territory
never
since
substantiated
had
taken
place
the
socialist
party
is
divided
it
is
a
great
pity
that
the
world
can
not
deal
with
men
of
the
type
of
scheidemann
who
in
other
democracies
would
appear
so
conservative
as
to
be
almost
reactionary
but
scheidemann
and
his
friends
while
they
have
in
their
attempted
negotiations
with
the
socialists
of
other
countries
the
present
protection
of
the
imperial
government
will
have
no
hand
in
dictating
terms
of
peace
so
long
as
that
government
is
in
existence
they
are
being
used
in
an
effort
to
divide
the
allies
as
president
wilson
said
in
his
message
to
russia
of
may
the
war
has
begun
to
go
against
germany
and
in
their
desperate
desire
to
escape
the
inevitable
ultimate
defeat
those
who
are
in
authority
in
germany
are
using
every
possible
instrumentality
are
making
use
even
of
the
influence
of
the
groups
and
parties
among
their
own
subjects
to
whom
they
have
never
been
just
or
fair
or
even
tolerant
to
promote
a
propaganda
on
both
sides
of
the
sea
which
will
preserve
for
them
their
influence
at
home
and
their
power
abroad
to
the
undoing
of
the
very
men
they
are
using
there
is
an
impression
abroad
that
the
social
democratic
party
of
germany
usually
known
abroad
as
the
socialist
party
partakes
of
at
least
some
of
the
characteristics
of
a
great
liberal
party
this
is
far
from
being
the
case
by
their
acts
if
not
by
their
express
declarations
they
have
shown
themselves
as
opposed
to
the
monarchical
form
of
government
and
their
leaders
are
charged
with
having
declared
themselves
openly
in
favour
of
free
love
and
against
religion
the
roman
catholic
church
recognises
in
social
democracy
its
greatest
enemy
and
has
made
great
efforts
to
counteract
its
advance
by
fostering
a
sort
of
roman
catholic
for
a
religious
body
of
socialists
the
social
democrat
in
germany
is
almost
an
outcast
although
one
third
of
the
members
of
the
reichstag
belong
to
this
party
its
members
are
never
called
to
hold
office
in
the
government
and
the
attitude
of
the
whole
of
the
governing
class
of
all
the
professors
priests
of
both
protestant
and
roman
catholic
religions
of
the
prosperous
middle
classes
is
that
of
violent
opposition
to
the
doctrines
of
social
democracy
the
world
must
entertain
no
illusion
that
the
social
democratic
leaders
speak
for
germany
if
the
industrial
populations
had
their
fair
share
of
representation
in
the
reichstag
they
might
perhaps
even
control
that
body
but
as
i
have
time
and
again
reiterated
the
reichstag
has
only
the
power
of
public
opinion
and
the
germany
of
is
ruled
by
officials
appointed
from
above
downwards
all
of
these
officials
in
germany
must
be
added
to
the
other
classes
that
i
have
mentioned
there
are
more
officials
there
than
in
any
other
country
in
the
world
as
they
owe
their
very
existence
to
the
government
they
must
not
only
serve
that
government
but
also
make
the
enemies
of
that
government
their
own
therefore
they
and
the
circle
of
their
connections
are
opponents
of
the
social
democrats
all
this
shows
how
difficult
it
is
at
present
for
the
men
of
reasonable
and
liberal
views
who
do
not
wish
to
declare
themselves
against
both
religion
and
morality
to
find
a
political
refuge
the
chancellor
himself
a
liberal
at
heart
as
i
have
said
has
declared
that
there
must
be
changes
in
germany
it
is
perhaps
within
the
bounds
of
probability
that
a
great
new
liberal
party
will
be
formed
to
which
i
have
referred
composed
of
the
more
conservative
social
democrats
of
the
remains
of
the
national
liberal
and
progressive
parties
and
of
the
more
liberal
of
the
conservatives
the
important
question
is
then
whether
the
roman
catholic
party
or
centrum
will
voluntarily
dissolve
and
its
members
cease
to
seek
election
merely
as
representatives
of
the
roman
catholic
church
it
is
perhaps
too
much
to
expect
that
the
centrum
party
as
a
whole
and
as
at
present
constituted
will
declare
for
liberalism
and
parliamentary
government
and
for
a
fair
redistricting
of
the
divisions
in
germany
which
elect
members
to
the
reichstag
but
there
are
many
wise
and
farseeing
men
in
this
party
and
its
leaders
spahn
and
erzberger
are
fearless
and
able
men
for
some
years
a
movement
has
been
going
on
in
the
centrum
party
looking
to
this
end
many
members
believed
that
the
time
had
come
when
it
was
no
longer
necessary
that
the
roman
catholics
in
order
to
safeguard
their
religious
liberties
continue
the
political
existence
of
the
centrum
and
attempts
were
made
to
bring
about
this
change
it
was
decided
adversely
however
by
the
roman
catholics
but
the
question
is
not
dead
voluntary
dissolution
of
the
centrum
as
a
roman
catholic
party
would
immediately
bring
about
a
creation
of
a
true
liberal
party
to
which
all
germans
could
belong
without
a
loss
of
social
prestige
without
becoming
declared
enemies
of
the
monarchy
and
without
declaring
themselves
against
religion
and
morality
at
the
congress
which
will
meet
after
the
war
it
will
be
easy
for
the
nations
of
the
world
to
deal
with
the
representatives
of
a
liberal
germany
with
representatives
of
a
government
still
monarchical
in
form
but
possessed
of
either
a
constitution
like
that
of
the
united
states
or
ruled
by
a
parliamentary
government
i
believe
that
the
tendency
of
german
liberalism
is
towards
the
easiest
transition
that
of
making
the
chancellor
and
his
ministers
responsible
to
the
reichstag
and
bound
to
resign
after
a
vote
of
want
of
confidence
by
that
body
at
the
time
of
the
zabern
affair
scheidemann
claimed
that
the
resignation
of
the
chancellor
must
logically
follow
a
vote
of
want
of
confidence
and
it
was
von
who
refused
to
resign
saying
that
he
was
responsible
to
the
emperor
alone
it
requires
no
violent
change
to
bring
about
this
establishment
of
parliamentary
government
and
if
the
members
of
the
reichstag
should
be
elected
from
districts
fairly
constituted
the
world
would
then
be
dealing
with
a
liberalised
germany
and
a
germany
which
has
become
liberalised
without
any
violent
change
in
the
form
of
its
government
of
course
coincident
with
this
parliamentary
reform
the
vicious
circle
system
of
voting
in
prussia
must
end
this
change
to
a
government
by
a
responsible
ministry
can
be
accomplished
under
the
constitution
of
the
german
empire
by
a
mere
majority
vote
of
the
reichstag
and
a
vote
in
the
bundesrat
in
which
less
than
fourteen
votes
are
against
the
proposed
change
in
the
constitution
this
means
that
the
consent
of
the
emperor
as
prussian
king
must
be
obtained
and
that
of
a
number
of
the
rulers
of
the
german
states
in
the
reasonable
liberalisation
of
germany
if
it
comes
theodor
wolff
and
his
mosse
will
play
leading
parts
the
great
newspaper
the
which
mosse
owns
and
wolff
edits
has
throughout
the
war
been
a
beacon
light
at
once
of
reason
and
of
patriotism
and
other
great
newspapers
will
take
the
same
enlightened
course
i
am
truly
sorry
for
georg
bernhard
the
talented
editor
of
the
who
a
liberal
and
a
jew
wears
the
livery
of
junkerdom
i
am
sure
to
his
great
distaste
after
i
left
germany
the
made
the
most
ridiculous
charges
against
me
such
as
that
i
issued
american
passports
to
british
subjects
the
newspaper
might
as
well
have
solemnly
charged
that
i
sent
notes
to
the
foreign
office
in
sealed
envelopes
having
charge
of
british
interests
i
could
not
issue
british
passports
to
british
citizens
allowed
to
leave
germany
but
according
to
universal
custom
in
similar
cases
and
the
express
consent
of
the
imperial
foreign
office
i
gave
these
returning
british
american
passports
superstamped
with
the
words
british
subject
a
mare
nest
truly
the
fall
of
von
was
a
triumph
of
kitchen
intrigue
and
of
junkerism
i
believe
that
he
is
a
liberal
at
heart
that
it
was
against
his
best
judgment
that
the
ruthless
submarine
war
was
resumed
the
pledges
of
the
note
broken
and
germany
involved
in
war
with
america
if
he
had
resigned
rather
than
consent
to
the
resumption
of
war
he
would
have
stood
out
as
a
great
liberal
rallying
point
and
probably
have
returned
to
a
more
real
power
than
he
ever
possessed
but
half
because
of
a
desire
to
retain
office
half
because
of
a
mistaken
loyalty
to
the
emperor
he
remained
in
office
at
the
sacrifice
of
his
opinions
and
when
he
laid
down
that
office
no
title
of
prince
or
even
of
count
waited
him
as
a
parting
gift
in
his
retirement
he
will
read
the
lines
of
schiller
a
favourite
quotation
in
germany
der
mohr
hat
seine
schuldigkeit
gethan
der
mohr
kann
gehen
the
moor
has
done
his
work
the
moor
can
go
and
in
his
old
age
he
will
exclaim
as
shakespeare
makes
the
great
chancellor
of
henry
the
eighth
exclaim
oh
cromwell
cromwell
had
i
but
served
my
god
with
half
the
zeal
i
served
my
king
he
would
not
in
mine
age
have
left
me
naked
to
mine
enemies
but
this
god
is
not
the
private
war
god
of
the
prussians
with
whom
they
believe
they
have
a
gentlemen
working
agreement
but
the
god
of
christianity
of
humanity
and
of
all
mankind
it
would
have
been
easier
for
germany
to
make
peace
with
von
at
the
helm
the
whole
world
knows
him
and
honours
him
for
his
honesty
helfferich
remained
as
and
minister
of
the
interior
a
powerful
and
agile
intellect
a
man
i
am
sure
opposed
to
militarism
reasonable
in
his
views
one
can
sit
at
the
council
table
with
him
and
arrive
at
compromises
and
results
but
his
intense
patriotism
and
surpassing
ability
make
him
an
opponent
to
be
feared
kühlmann
has
the
foreign
office
far
more
wily
than
zimmermann
he
will
continue
to
strive
to
embroil
us
with
japan
and
mexico
but
he
will
not
be
caught
second
in
command
in
london
he
reported
then
that
england
would
enter
the
war
the
rumours
scattered
broadcast
as
he
took
office
to
the
effect
that
he
was
opposed
to
ruthless
war
were
but
evidences
of
a
more
skilful
hand
in
a
campaign
to
predispose
the
world
in
his
favour
and
therefore
to
assist
him
in
any
negotiations
he
might
have
on
the
carpet
beware
of
the
wily
kühlmann
baiting
the
chancellor
is
the
favourite
sport
of
german
political
life
no
sooner
does
the
kaiser
name
a
chancellor
than
hundreds
of
little
politicians
reichstag
members
editors
reporters
and
female
intriguers
try
to
drive
him
from
office
when
von
showed
an
inclination
towards
liberalism
and
advocated
a
juster
electoral
system
for
prussia
the
junkers
the
military
and
the
upholders
of
the
caste
system
joined
their
forces
to
those
of
the
usual
intriguers
and
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
until
the
chancellor
official
head
fell
in
the
basket
his
successor
is
a
prussian
bureaucrat
no
further
description
is
necessary
of
course
no
nation
will
permit
itself
to
be
reformed
from
without
the
position
of
the
world
in
arms
with
reference
to
germany
is
simply
this
it
is
impossible
to
make
peace
with
germany
as
at
present
constituted
because
that
peace
will
be
but
a
truce
a
short
breathing
space
before
the
german
military
autocrats
again
send
the
sons
of
germany
to
death
in
the
trenches
for
the
advancement
of
the
system
and
the
personal
glory
and
advantage
of
stuffy
old
generals
and
prancing
princes
the
world
does
not
believe
that
a
free
germany
will
needlessly
make
war
believe
in
war
for
war
sake
or
take
up
the
profession
of
arms
as
a
national
industry
the
choice
lies
with
the
german
people
and
how
admirably
has
our
great
president
shown
that
people
that
we
war
not
with
them
but
with
the
autocracy
which
has
led
them
into
the
shambles
of
dishonour
chapter
xix
the
german
people
in
war
with
the
declaration
of
war
the
ultimate
power
in
germany
was
transferred
from
the
civil
to
the
military
authorities
at
five
on
the
afternoon
of
friday
and
immediately
after
the
declaration
of
a
state
of
war
the
guard
of
the
grenadier
regiment
kaiser
alexander
under
the
command
of
a
lieutenant
with
four
drummers
took
its
place
before
the
monument
of
frederick
the
great
in
the
middle
of
the
unter
den
linden
the
drummers
sounded
a
ruffle
on
their
drums
and
the
lieutenant
read
an
order
beginning
with
the
words
by
all
highest
order
a
state
of
war
is
proclaimed
in
berlin
and
in
the
province
of
brandenburg
this
order
was
signed
by
general
von
kessel
as
of
the
mark
of
brandenburg
and
stated
that
the
complete
power
was
transferred
to
him
that
the
civil
officials
might
remain
in
office
but
must
obey
the
orders
and
regulations
of
the
that
and
arrests
by
officials
thereto
empowered
could
take
place
at
any
time
that
strangers
who
could
not
show
good
reason
for
remaining
in
berlin
had
hours
in
which
to
leave
that
the
sale
of
weapons
powder
and
explosives
to
civilians
was
forbidden
and
that
civilians
were
forbidden
to
carry
weapons
without
permission
of
the
proper
authorities
the
same
transfer
of
authority
took
place
in
each
army
corps
or
province
or
district
in
germany
and
in
each
army
corps
district
or
province
the
commanding
general
took
over
the
ultimate
power
in
berlin
it
was
necessary
to
create
a
new
officer
the
of
the
mark
because
two
army
corps
the
third
and
the
army
corps
of
the
guards
had
their
in
berlin
these
army
corps
commanders
were
not
at
all
bashful
about
the
use
of
the
power
thus
transferred
to
them
some
of
them
even
prescribed
the
length
of
the
dresses
to
be
worn
by
the
women
and
many
women
having
followed
the
german
sport
custom
of
wearing
knickerbockers
in
the
winter
sports
resorts
of
the
generalkommando
or
headquarters
for
bavaria
issued
in
january
the
following
order
the
appearance
of
many
women
in
has
excited
lively
anger
and
indignation
in
the
population
there
this
bitterness
is
directed
particularly
against
certain
women
frequently
of
ripe
age
who
do
not
engage
in
sports
but
nevertheless
show
themselves
in
public
continually
clad
in
knickerbockers
it
has
even
happened
that
women
so
dressed
have
visited
churches
during
the
service
such
behaviour
is
a
cruelty
to
the
earnest
minds
of
the
mountain
population
and
in
consequence
there
are
often
many
disagreeable
occurrences
in
the
streets
officials
priests
and
private
citizens
have
turned
to
the
generalkommando
with
the
request
for
help
and
the
generalkommando
has
therefore
empowered
the
district
officials
in
to
take
energetic
measures
against
this
misconduct
if
necessary
with
the
aid
of
the
police
i
spent
two
days
at
in
february
some
of
the
german
girls
looked
very
well
in
their
knickers
but
i
agree
with
the
generalkommando
that
the
appearance
of
some
of
the
older
women
was
cruelty
not
only
to
the
earnest
mountain
population
but
to
any
observer
these
corps
commanders
are
apparently
responsible
direct
to
the
emperor
and
therefore
much
of
the
difficulty
that
i
had
concerning
the
treatment
of
prisoners
was
due
to
this
system
as
each
corps
commander
considered
himself
supreme
in
his
own
district
not
only
over
the
civil
and
military
population
but
over
the
prison
camps
within
his
jurisdiction
on
the
fourth
of
august
a
number
of
laws
were
passed
which
had
been
evidently
prepared
long
in
advance
making
various
changes
made
necessary
by
war
such
as
alteration
of
the
coinage
law
the
bank
law
and
the
law
of
maximum
prices
laws
as
to
the
high
prices
were
made
from
time
to
time
for
instance
the
law
of
the
of
october
provided
in
detail
the
maximum
prices
for
rye
in
different
parts
of
germany
the
maximum
price
at
wholesale
per
german
ton
of
native
rye
must
not
exceed
marks
in
berlin
marks
in
cologne
marks
in
koenigsberg
marks
in
hamburg
marks
in
frankfort
the
maximum
price
for
the
german
ton
of
native
wheat
was
set
at
forty
marks
per
ton
higher
than
the
above
rates
for
rye
this
maximum
price
was
made
with
reference
to
deliveries
without
sacks
and
for
cash
payments
the
law
as
to
the
maximum
prices
applied
to
all
objects
of
daily
necessity
not
only
to
food
and
fodder
but
to
oil
coal
and
wood
of
course
these
maximum
prices
were
changed
from
time
to
time
but
i
think
i
can
safely
state
that
at
no
time
in
the
war
while
i
was
in
berlin
were
the
simple
foods
more
expensive
than
in
new
york
the
war
bread
the
staple
food
of
the
population
which
was
made
soon
after
the
commencement
of
the
war
was
composed
partially
of
rye
and
potato
flour
it
was
not
at
all
unpalatable
especially
when
toasted
and
when
it
was
seen
that
the
war
would
not
be
as
short
as
the
germans
had
expected
the
bread
cards
were
issued
that
is
every
monday
morning
each
person
was
given
a
card
which
had
annexed
to
it
a
number
of
little
perforated
sections
about
the
size
of
a
quarter
of
a
postage
stamp
each
marked
with
fifty
or
one
hundred
the
total
of
these
figures
constituted
the
allowance
of
each
person
in
grammes
per
week
the
person
desiring
to
buy
bread
either
at
a
baker
or
in
a
restaurant
must
turn
in
these
little
stamped
sections
for
an
amount
equivalent
to
the
weight
of
bread
purchased
each
baker
was
given
a
certain
amount
of
meal
at
the
commencement
of
each
week
and
he
had
to
account
for
this
meal
at
the
end
of
the
week
by
turning
in
its
equivalent
in
bread
cards
as
food
became
scarce
the
card
system
was
applied
to
meat
potatoes
milk
sugar
butter
and
soap
green
vegetables
and
fruits
were
exempt
from
the
card
system
as
were
for
a
long
time
chickens
ducks
geese
turkeys
and
game
because
of
these
exemptions
the
rich
usually
managed
to
live
well
although
the
price
of
a
goose
rose
to
ridiculous
heights
there
was
of
course
much
underground
traffic
in
cards
and
sales
of
illicit
or
smuggled
butter
etc
the
police
were
very
stern
in
their
enforcement
of
the
law
and
the
manager
of
one
of
the
largest
hotels
in
berlin
was
taken
to
prison
because
he
had
made
the
servants
give
him
their
allowance
of
butter
which
he
in
turn
sold
to
the
rich
guests
of
the
hotel
no
one
over
six
years
of
age
at
the
time
i
left
could
get
milk
without
a
doctor
certificate
one
result
of
this
was
that
the
children
of
the
poor
were
surer
of
obtaining
milk
than
before
the
war
as
the
women
of
the
frauendienst
and
social
workers
saw
to
it
that
each
child
had
its
share
the
third
winter
of
the
war
owing
to
a
breakdown
of
means
of
transportation
and
want
of
laborers
coal
became
very
scarce
all
public
places
such
as
theatres
picture
galleries
museums
and
cinematograph
shows
were
closed
in
munich
for
want
of
coal
in
berlin
the
suffering
was
not
as
great
but
even
the
elephants
from
hagenbeck
show
were
pressed
into
service
to
draw
the
coal
carts
from
the
railway
stations
light
was
economized
all
the
apartment
houses
and
all
berlin
lives
in
apartment
houses
were
closed
at
nine
stores
were
forbidden
to
illuminate
their
show
windows
and
all
theatres
were
closed
at
ten
only
every
other
street
electric
light
was
lit
of
the
three
lights
in
each
lamp
only
one
as
more
and
more
men
were
called
to
the
front
women
were
employed
in
unusual
work
the
new
underground
road
in
berlin
is
being
built
largely
by
woman
labour
this
is
not
so
difficult
a
matter
in
berlin
as
in
new
york
because
berlin
is
built
upon
a
bed
of
sand
and
the
difficulties
of
rock
excavation
do
not
exist
women
are
employed
on
the
railroads
working
with
pickaxes
on
the
women
drive
the
great
yellow
post
carts
of
berlin
there
were
women
guards
on
the
underground
road
women
conductors
on
the
tramways
and
women
even
become
motor
men
on
the
tramcars
banks
insurance
companies
and
other
large
business
institutions
were
filled
with
women
workers
who
invaded
the
sacred
precincts
of
many
military
and
governmental
offices
a
curious
development
of
the
hate
of
all
things
foreign
was
the
hunt
led
by
the
police
president
of
berlin
von
jagow
a
cousin
of
the
foreign
minister
for
foreign
words
von
jagow
and
his
fellow
cranks
decided
that
all
words
of
foreign
origin
must
be
expunged
from
the
german
language
the
title
of
the
hotel
bristol
on
the
unter
den
linden
disappeared
the
hotel
westminster
on
the
same
street
became
lindenhof
there
is
a
large
hotel
called
the
cumberland
with
a
pastry
department
over
which
there
was
a
sign
the
french
word
the
management
was
compelled
to
take
this
sign
down
but
the
hotel
was
allowed
to
retain
the
name
of
cumberland
because
the
of
the
kaiser
only
daughter
is
the
duke
of
cumberland
the
word
chauffeur
was
eliminated
and
there
were
many
discussions
as
to
what
should
be
substituted
many
declared
for
kraftwagenfuhrer
or
power
wagon
driver
but
finally
the
word
was
germanised
as
schauffoer
prussians
took
down
the
sign
but
the
climax
came
when
the
general
in
command
of
the
town
of
breslau
wrote
a
confectioner
telling
him
to
stop
the
use
of
the
word
in
selling
his
candy
the
confectioner
with
a
sense
of
humour
and
a
nerve
unusual
in
germany
wrote
back
to
the
general
that
he
would
gladly
discontinue
the
use
of
the
word
when
the
general
ceased
to
call
himself
general
and
called
the
attention
of
this
high
military
authority
to
the
fact
that
general
was
as
much
a
french
word
as
unusual
means
were
adopted
in
order
to
get
all
the
gold
coins
in
the
country
into
the
imperial
bank
there
were
signs
in
every
surface
and
underground
car
which
read
whoever
keeps
back
a
gold
coin
injures
the
fatherland
and
if
a
soldier
presented
to
his
superiors
a
twenty
mark
gold
piece
he
received
in
return
twenty
marks
in
paper
money
and
two
days
leave
of
absence
in
like
manner
a
school
boy
who
turned
in
ten
marks
in
gold
received
ten
marks
in
paper
and
was
given
a
half
holiday
cinematograph
shows
gave
these
patrons
who
paid
in
gold
an
extra
ticket
good
for
another
day
an
american
woman
residing
at
berlin
was
awakened
one
morning
at
eight
by
two
police
detectives
who
told
her
that
they
had
heard
that
she
had
some
gold
coins
in
her
possession
and
that
if
she
did
not
turn
them
in
for
paper
money
they
would
wreck
her
apartment
in
their
search
for
them
she
therefore
gave
them
the
gold
which
i
afterwards
succeeded
in
getting
the
german
government
to
return
to
her
later
the
export
of
gold
was
forbidden
and
even
travellers
arriving
with
gold
were
compelled
to
give
it
up
in
return
for
paper
money
while
of
course
i
can
not
ascertain
the
exact
amounts
i
found
nevertheless
that
great
quantities
of
food
and
other
supplies
came
into
germany
from
holland
and
the
scandinavian
countries
particularly
from
sweden
now
that
we
are
in
the
war
we
should
take
strong
measures
and
cut
off
exports
to
these
countries
which
export
food
raw
material
etc
to
germany
sweden
is
particularly
active
in
this
traffic
but
i
understand
that
sulphur
pyrites
are
sent
from
norway
and
sulphuric
acid
made
therefrom
is
an
absolute
essential
to
the
manufacture
of
munitions
of
war
potash
which
is
found
as
a
mineral
only
in
germany
and
austria
was
used
in
exchange
of
commodities
with
sweden
and
in
this
way
much
copper
lard
etc
reached
germany
early
in
the
summer
of
the
first
demonstration
took
place
in
berlin
about
five
hundred
women
collected
in
front
of
the
reichstag
building
they
were
promptly
suppressed
by
the
police
and
no
newspaper
printed
an
account
of
the
occurrence
these
women
were
rather
vague
in
their
demands
they
called
von
buelow
an
old
for
his
failure
in
italy
and
complained
that
the
whipped
cream
was
not
so
good
as
before
the
war
there
was
some
talk
of
high
prices
for
food
and
the
women
all
said
that
they
wanted
their
men
back
from
the
trenches
early
summer
brought
also
a
number
of
cranks
to
berlin
miss
jane
addams
and
her
fellow
suffragists
after
holding
a
convention
in
holland
moved
on
berlin
i
succeeded
in
getting
both
the
chancellor
and
von
jagow
to
consent
to
receive
them
a
meeting
to
which
they
looked
forward
with
unconcealed
perturbation
however
one
of
them
seems
to
have
impressed
miss
addams
for
as
i
write
this
i
read
in
the
papers
that
she
is
complaining
that
we
should
not
have
gone
to
war
because
we
thereby
risk
hurting
feelings
on
july
i
reported
that
i
had
learned
that
the
germans
were
picking
out
the
revolutionists
and
liberals
from
the
many
russian
prisoners
of
war
furnishing
them
with
money
and
false
passports
and
papers
and
sending
them
back
to
russia
to
stir
up
a
revolution
a
german
friend
of
mine
told
me
that
a
friend
of
his
who
manufactured
field
glasses
had
received
a
large
order
from
the
bulgarian
government
this
manufacturer
went
to
the
foreign
office
and
asked
whether
he
should
deliver
the
goods
he
was
told
not
only
to
deliver
them
but
to
do
it
as
quickly
as
possible
by
learning
of
this
i
was
able
to
predict
long
in
advance
the
entry
of
bulgaria
on
the
side
of
the
central
powers
even
a
year
after
the
commencement
of
the
war
there
were
reasonable
people
in
germany
i
met
ballin
head
of
the
great
hamburg
american
line
on
august
ninth
i
said
to
him
when
are
you
going
to
stop
this
crazy
fighting
the
next
day
ballin
called
on
me
and
said
that
the
sensible
people
of
germany
wanted
peace
and
that
without
annexation
he
told
me
that
every
one
was
afraid
to
talk
peace
that
each
country
thought
it
a
sign
of
weakness
and
that
he
had
advised
the
chancellor
to
put
a
statement
in
an
official
paper
to
say
that
germany
fought
only
to
defend
herself
and
was
ready
to
make
an
honourable
peace
he
told
me
that
the
emperor
at
that
time
was
against
the
annexation
of
belgium
in
calculating
the
great
war
debt
built
up
by
germany
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
german
municipalities
and
other
political
districts
have
incurred
large
debts
for
war
purposes
such
as
extra
relief
given
to
the
wives
and
children
of
soldiers
in
november
there
were
food
disturbances
and
a
serious
agitation
against
a
continuance
of
the
war
and
in
leipzig
a
socialist
paper
was
suppressed
the
greatest
efforts
were
made
at
all
times
to
get
in
gold
and
some
time
before
i
left
germany
an
advertisement
was
published
in
the
newspapers
requesting
germans
to
give
up
their
jewelry
for
the
fatherland
many
did
so
among
them
i
believe
the
empress
and
other
royalties
in
december
a
prominent
banker
in
berlin
said
to
me
that
the
germans
were
sick
of
the
war
that
the
krupps
and
other
big
industries
were
making
great
sums
of
money
and
were
prolonging
the
war
by
insisting
upon
the
annexation
of
belgium
and
that
the
junkers
were
also
in
favour
of
the
continuance
of
the
war
because
of
the
fact
that
they
were
getting
four
or
five
times
the
money
for
their
products
while
their
work
was
being
done
by
prisoners
he
said
that
the
merchant
middle
class
will
have
to
pay
the
cost
of
the
war
and
that
the
junkers
will
not
be
taxed
in
december
butter
became
very
scarce
and
the
women
waiting
in
long
lines
before
the
shops
often
rushed
the
shops
in
this
month
many
copper
roofs
were
removed
from
buildings
in
berlin
i
was
told
by
a
friend
in
the
foreign
office
that
the
notorious
von
rintelen
was
sent
to
america
to
buy
up
the
entire
product
of
the
dupont
powder
factories
and
that
he
exceeded
his
authority
if
he
did
anything
else
in
december
on
the
night
of
the
day
of
the
peace
interpellation
in
the
reichstag
a
call
was
issued
by
placards
for
a
meeting
on
the
unter
den
linden
i
went
out
on
the
streets
during
the
afternoon
and
found
that
the
police
had
so
carefully
divided
the
city
into
districts
that
it
was
impossible
for
a
crowd
of
any
size
to
gather
on
the
unter
den
linden
there
was
quite
a
row
at
the
session
in
the
reichstag
scheidemann
the
socialist
made
a
speech
very
moderate
in
tone
but
he
was
answered
by
the
chancellor
and
then
an
endeavour
was
made
to
close
the
debate
the
socialists
made
such
a
noise
however
that
the
majority
gave
way
and
another
prominent
socialist
landsberger
was
allowed
to
speak
for
the
socialists
he
also
made
a
reasonable
speech
in
the
course
of
which
he
said
that
even
socialists
would
not
allow
to
go
back
to
france
he
made
use
of
a
rather
good
phrase
saying
that
the
states
of
europe
were
making
war
to
make
a
place
for
the
united
states
of
america
the
banks
sent
out
circulars
to
all
holders
of
safe
deposit
boxes
asking
them
to
disclose
the
contents
this
was
part
of
the
campaign
to
get
in
hoarded
gold
in
january
we
had
many
visitors
mcclure
hermann
bernstein
inez
milholland
boissevain
all
of
the
ford
peace
ship
appeared
in
berlin
i
introduced
boissevain
to
zimmermann
who
admired
her
extremely
in
january
i
visited
munich
and
from
there
a
bavarian
officer
prison
camp
and
the
prison
camp
for
private
soldiers
both
at
ingolstadt
i
also
conferred
with
archdeacon
nies
of
the
american
episcopal
church
who
carried
on
a
much
needed
work
in
visiting
the
prison
camps
in
bavaria
the
american
colony
in
munich
maintained
with
the
help
of
friends
in
america
a
red
cross
hospital
under
the
able
charge
of
jung
a
washington
doctor
and
his
wife
the
nursing
was
done
by
american
and
german
girls
the
american
colony
at
munich
also
fed
a
number
of
school
children
every
day
i
regret
to
say
however
that
many
of
the
americans
in
munich
were
loud
in
their
abuse
of
president
wilson
and
their
native
country
in
march
i
was
sounded
on
the
question
of
germany
sending
an
unofficial
envoy
like
colonel
house
to
america
to
talk
informally
to
the
president
and
prominent
people
i
was
told
that
solf
would
probably
be
named
in
the
importation
of
many
articles
of
luxury
into
germany
was
forbidden
this
move
was
naturally
made
in
order
to
keep
money
in
the
country
a
dane
who
had
a
quantity
of
manganese
in
brazil
sold
it
to
a
philadelphia
firm
for
delivery
to
the
united
states
steel
company
the
german
government
in
some
way
learned
of
this
and
the
dane
was
arrested
and
put
in
jail
his
minister
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
him
out
liebknecht
in
april
of
made
matters
lively
at
the
reichstag
sessions
during
the
chancellor
speech
liebknecht
interrupted
him
and
said
that
the
germans
were
not
free
next
he
denied
that
the
germans
had
not
wished
war
and
another
time
he
called
attention
to
the
attempts
of
the
germans
to
induce
the
mohammedan
and
irish
prisoners
of
war
to
desert
to
the
german
side
liebknecht
finally
enraged
the
government
supporters
by
calling
out
that
the
subscription
to
the
loan
was
a
swindle
after
the
settlement
i
think
that
the
germans
wished
to
inaugurate
an
era
of
better
feeling
between
germany
and
the
united
states
at
any
rate
and
in
answer
to
many
anonymous
attacks
made
against
me
the
german
the
official
newspaper
published
a
sort
of
certificate
from
the
government
to
the
effect
that
i
was
a
good
boy
and
that
the
rumours
of
my
bitter
hostility
to
germany
were
unfounded
in
may
wertheim
head
of
the
great
department
store
in
berlin
told
me
that
they
had
more
business
than
in
peace
times
early
in
june
had
two
long
talks
with
prince
von
buelow
he
speaks
english
well
and
is
suspected
by
his
enemies
of
having
been
polishing
it
up
lately
in
order
to
make
ready
for
possible
peace
conferences
he
is
a
man
of
a
more
active
brain
than
the
present
chancellor
and
is
very
restless
and
anxious
in
some
way
to
break
into
the
present
political
situation
in
june
the
anonymous
attacks
on
the
chancellor
by
pamphlet
and
otherwise
incensed
him
to
such
a
degree
that
he
made
an
open
answer
in
the
reichstag
and
had
rather
the
best
of
the
situation
many
anonymous
lies
and
rumours
were
flying
about
berlin
at
this
period
and
even
helfferich
had
to
deny
publicly
the
anonymous
charges
that
he
had
been
anonymously
attacking
the
chancellor
in
july
the
committee
called
the
national
committee
for
an
honourable
peace
was
formed
with
prince
wedel
at
its
head
most
of
the
people
in
this
league
were
friends
of
the
chancellor
and
one
of
the
three
real
heads
was
the
editor
of
the
the
chancellor
organ
it
was
planned
that
fifty
speakers
from
this
committee
would
begin
to
speak
all
over
germany
on
august
first
but
when
they
began
to
speak
their
views
were
so
dissimilar
and
the
speeches
of
most
of
them
so
ridiculous
that
the
movement
failed
in
august
i
spent
two
saturdays
and
sundays
at
heringsdorf
a
summer
resort
on
the
baltic
before
going
there
i
had
to
get
special
permission
from
the
military
authorities
through
the
foreign
office
as
foreigners
are
not
allowed
to
reside
on
the
coast
of
germany
regulations
that
all
windows
must
be
darkened
at
night
and
no
lights
shown
which
could
be
seen
from
the
sea
were
strictly
enforced
by
the
authorities
there
are
three
bathing
places
in
each
of
them
the
bath
houses
etc
surround
three
sides
of
a
square
the
sea
forming
the
fourth
side
bathing
is
allowed
only
on
this
fourth
side
for
a
space
of
yards
long
one
of
these
bathing
places
is
for
women
and
one
for
men
and
the
third
is
the
familienbad
family
bath
where
mixed
bathing
is
allowed
german
women
are
very
sensible
in
the
matter
of
their
bathing
costumes
and
do
not
wear
the
extraordinary
creations
seen
in
america
they
wear
bathing
sandals
but
no
stockings
and
as
most
of
them
have
fine
figures
but
dress
badly
they
appear
at
their
best
at
heringsdorf
both
sea
and
air
seemed
somewhat
cold
for
bathing
on
account
of
their
sensible
dress
most
of
the
german
women
are
expert
swimmers
i
noticed
one
very
handsome
blonde
girl
who
sat
on
her
bathing
mantle
exciting
the
admiration
of
the
beach
because
of
her
fine
figure
she
suddenly
dived
into
the
pockets
of
the
bathing
mantle
and
produced
an
enormous
black
bread
sandwich
which
she
proceeded
to
consume
quite
unconsciously
after
which
she
swam
out
to
sea
no
healthy
german
can
remain
long
separated
from
food
and
i
noticed
in
the
prospectus
of
the
different
at
heringsdorf
that
patrons
were
offered
in
addition
to
about
four
meals
or
more
a
day
an
extra
sandwich
to
take
to
the
beach
to
be
consumed
during
the
bathing
hour
there
is
a
beautiful
little
english
church
in
berlin
which
was
especially
favoured
by
the
kaiser
mother
during
her
life
because
of
this
the
kaiser
permitted
this
church
to
remain
open
and
the
services
were
continued
during
the
war
the
pastor
rev
williams
obtained
permission
to
visit
the
british
prisoners
and
most
devotedly
travelled
from
one
prison
camp
to
another
both
he
and
his
sister
whose
charitable
work
for
the
british
deserves
mention
were
at
one
time
thrown
into
jail
charged
with
spying
i
at
first
attended
the
hybrid
american
church
but
when
in
i
think
the
committee
hired
a
german
preacher
i
ceased
to
attend
the
american
the
reverend
crosser
who
was
in
charge
when
i
arrived
in
berlin
left
to
my
everlasting
regret
in
the
spring
before
the
war
poor
creelman
the
celebrated
newspaper
correspondent
died
in
berlin
we
got
him
in
to
a
good
hospital
and
some
one
from
the
embassy
visited
him
every
day
the
funeral
services
were
conducted
in
the
american
church
by
the
rev
dickie
long
a
resident
of
berlin
whose
wife
had
presented
the
library
to
the
american
church
the
foreign
office
sent
herr
horstmann
as
its
representative
while
all
royalties
and
public
men
pose
for
the
movies
czar
ferdinand
of
bulgaria
and
his
family
are
probably
the
first
royalties
to
act
in
a
cinematograph
in
there
was
released
in
berlin
a
play
in
which
czar
ferdinand
of
bulgaria
his
wife
and
two
daughters
by
a
former
wife
appeared
acting
as
bulgarian
royalties
in
the
development
of
the
plot
the
difference
between
von
jagow
and
zimmermann
was
that
von
jagow
had
lived
abroad
had
met
people
from
all
countries
and
knew
that
there
was
much
to
learn
about
the
psychology
of
the
inhabitants
of
countries
other
than
germany
zimmermann
in
the
early
part
of
his
career
had
been
consul
at
shanghai
and
on
his
way
back
had
passed
through
america
spending
two
days
in
san
francisco
and
three
in
new
york
he
seemed
to
think
that
this
transcontinental
trip
had
given
him
an
intimate
knowledge
of
american
character
von
jagow
on
the
other
hand
almost
as
soon
as
war
began
spent
many
hours
talking
to
me
about
america
and
borrowed
from
me
books
and
novels
on
that
country
the
novel
in
which
he
took
the
greatest
interest
was
turmoil
by
booth
tarkington
i
think
there
must
have
been
a
period
quite
recently
when
the
german
government
tried
to
imbue
the
people
with
a
greater
degree
of
frightfulness
because
all
of
us
in
visiting
camps
etc
observed
that
the
men
or
older
soldiers
were
much
more
merciful
than
the
younger
ones
alexander
cochran
a
new
york
yachtsman
volunteered
to
become
a
courier
between
the
london
embassy
and
ours
on
his
first
trip
although
he
had
two
passports
his
regular
passport
and
a
special
courier
passport
he
was
arrested
and
compelled
to
spend
the
night
on
the
floor
of
the
at
the
frontier
town
of
bentheim
this
ended
his
aspirations
to
be
a
courier
he
is
now
a
commander
in
the
british
navy
having
joined
it
with
his
large
steam
yacht
the
some
time
before
the
united
states
entered
the
war
in
the
piping
times
of
peace
he
had
been
the
guest
of
the
emperor
at
kiel
a
british
prisoner
who
escaped
from
ruhleben
was
caught
in
a
curious
manner
prisoners
in
ruhleben
received
bread
from
outside
as
i
have
explained
in
the
chapter
on
prisoners
of
war
this
bread
is
white
something
unknown
in
germany
since
the
war
the
escaped
prisoner
took
with
him
some
sandwiches
made
of
the
bread
he
had
received
in
ruhleben
and
most
incautiously
ate
one
of
these
sandwiches
in
a
railway
station
he
was
immediately
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
germans
anxious
to
know
where
he
had
obtained
the
white
bread
and
in
this
way
was
detected
and
returned
to
prison
on
our
way
out
in
september
we
were
given
a
large
dinner
in
copenhagen
by
our
skilful
minister
there
the
hon
maurice
egan
who
has
devoted
many
years
of
his
life
to
the
task
of
adding
the
three
beautiful
danish
islands
to
the
dominions
of
the
united
states
he
is
an
able
diplomat
very
popular
in
copenhagen
where
he
is
dean
of
the
diplomatic
corps
at
this
dinner
we
met
countess
whose
interesting
books
the
sunny
side
of
diplomatic
life
and
the
courts
of
memory
have
had
a
large
circulation
in
america
in
copenhagen
too
both
on
the
way
out
and
in
we
lunched
with
count
then
german
minister
there
count
rantzau
is
skilful
and
wily
and
not
at
all
military
in
his
instincts
and
i
should
say
far
more
inclined
to
arrive
at
a
reasonable
compromise
than
the
average
german
diplomat
he
is
a
charming
international
with
none
of
the
rough
points
and
aggressive
manners
which
characterise
so
many
prussian
officials
in
judging
the
german
people
we
must
remember
that
while
they
have
made
great
progress
in
the
last
forty
years
in
commerce
and
chemistry
the
very
little
liberty
they
possess
is
a
plant
of
very
recent
growth
about
the
year
frederick
the
great
having
sent
some
money
to
restore
the
burned
city
of
greiffenberg
in
silesia
the
magistrates
of
that
town
called
upon
him
to
thank
him
they
kneeled
and
their
spokesman
said
we
render
unto
your
majesty
in
the
name
of
the
inhabitants
of
greiffenberg
our
humble
thanks
for
the
most
gracious
gift
which
your
majesty
deigned
to
bestow
in
aid
and
to
assist
us
in
rebuilding
our
homes
the
gratitude
of
such
dust
as
we
is
as
we
are
aware
of
no
moment
or
value
to
you
we
shall
however
implore
god
to
grant
your
majesty
his
divine
favours
in
return
for
your
royal
bounty
too
many
germans
feel
that
they
are
mere
dust
before
the
almost
countless
royalties
of
the
german
empire
and
these
royalties
are
too
prone
to
feel
that
the
kingdoms
dukedoms
and
principalities
of
germany
and
their
inhabitants
are
their
private
property
the
princes
of
nassau
and
anspach
and
hesse
at
the
time
of
our
revolution
sold
their
unfortunate
subjects
to
the
british
government
to
be
exported
to
fight
the
americans
our
american
soil
covers
the
bones
of
many
a
poor
german
peasant
who
gave
up
his
life
in
a
war
from
which
he
gained
nothing
when
frederick
the
great
the
model
and
exemplar
of
all
german
royalties
died
in
he
disposed
of
the
kingdom
of
prussia
in
his
will
as
if
it
had
been
one
of
his
horses
i
bequeath
unto
my
dear
nephew
frederick
william
as
unto
my
immediate
successor
the
kingdom
of
prussia
the
provinces
towns
palaces
forts
fortresses
all
ammunition
and
arsenals
all
lands
mine
by
inheritance
or
right
of
conquest
the
crown
jewels
gold
and
silver
service
of
plate
in
berlin
country
houses
collections
of
coins
picture
galleries
gardens
and
so
forth
contrast
this
will
with
the
utterances
of
washington
and
hamilton
made
at
the
same
time
in
the
grand
duchies
of
mecklenburg
serfdom
was
not
abolished
until
the
spies
and
the
influencers
of
american
correspondents
made
their
headquarters
at
a
large
berlin
hotel
a
sketch
of
their
activities
is
given
by
de
beaufort
in
his
book
behind
the
german
veil
among
the
american
correspondents
in
berlin
during
the
war
great
credit
should
be
given
to
carl
ackerman
and
seymour
conger
correspondents
of
the
united
and
associated
presses
respectively
who
at
all
times
and
in
spite
of
their
surroundings
and
in
the
face
of
real
difficulties
preserved
their
americanism
unimpaired
and
refused
to
succumb
to
the
alluring
temptations
held
out
to
them
i
do
not
mean
to
imply
that
the
other
correspondents
were
not
loyal
but
the
of
many
of
them
unfortunately
gave
the
imperial
foreign
office
and
the
great
general
staff
a
wrong
impression
of
americans
it
is
the
splendid
patriotism
under
fire
of
ackerman
and
conger
that
deserves
special
mention
chapter
xx
last
i
was
credited
by
the
germans
with
having
hoodwinked
and
jollied
the
foreign
office
and
the
government
into
refraining
for
two
years
from
using
illegally
their
most
effective
weapon
this
of
course
is
not
so
i
always
told
the
foreign
office
the
plain
simple
truth
and
the
event
showed
that
i
correctly
predicted
the
attitude
of
america
our
american
national
game
poker
has
given
us
abroad
an
unfair
reputation
we
are
always
supposed
to
be
bluffing
a
book
was
published
in
germany
about
the
president
called
president
bluff
i
only
regret
that
those
high
in
authority
in
germany
should
have
preferred
to
listen
to
correspondents
who
posed
as
amateur
rather
than
to
the
authorised
representatives
of
america
i
left
germany
with
a
clear
conscience
and
the
knowledge
that
i
had
done
everything
possible
to
keep
the
peace
an
ambassador
of
course
does
not
determine
the
policy
of
his
own
country
one
of
his
principal
duties
if
not
the
principal
one
is
to
keep
his
own
country
informed
to
know
beforehand
what
the
country
to
which
he
is
accredited
will
do
and
i
think
that
i
managed
to
give
the
state
department
advance
information
of
the
moves
of
the
rulers
of
germany
i
had
the
support
of
a
loyal
and
devoted
staff
of
competent
secretaries
and
assistants
and
both
secretaries
bryan
and
lansing
were
most
kind
in
the
backing
given
by
their
very
ably
organised
department
i
sent
secretary
lansing
a
confidential
letter
every
week
and
of
course
received
most
valuable
hints
from
him
secretary
lansing
was
very
successful
in
his
tactful
handling
of
the
american
ambassadors
abroad
and
in
getting
them
to
work
together
as
cheerful
members
of
the
same
team
when
i
returned
to
america
after
living
for
two
and
a
half
years
in
the
centre
of
this
world
calamity
everything
seemed
petty
and
small
i
was
surprised
that
people
could
still
seek
little
advantages
still
be
actuated
by
little
jealousies
and
revenges
freed
from
the
round
of
daily
work
i
felt
for
the
first
time
the
utter
horror
and
uselessness
of
all
the
misery
these
prussian
military
autocrats
had
brought
upon
the
world
and
what
a
reckoning
there
will
be
in
germany
some
day
when
the
plain
people
realise
the
truth
when
they
learn
what
base
motives
actuated
their
rulers
in
condemning
a
whole
generation
of
the
earth
to
war
and
death
is
it
not
a
shame
that
the
world
should
have
been
so
disturbed
that
peaceful
men
are
compelled
to
lie
out
in
the
mud
and
filth
in
the
depth
of
raw
winter
shot
at
and
stormed
at
and
shelled
waiting
for
a
chance
to
murder
some
other
inoffensive
fellow
creature
why
must
the
people
in
old
poland
die
of
hunger
not
finding
dogs
enough
to
eat
in
the
streets
of
lemberg
the
long
lines
of
broken
peasants
in
serbia
and
in
roumania
the
population
of
belgium
and
northern
france
torn
from
their
homes
to
work
as
slaves
for
the
germans
the
poor
prisoners
of
war
starving
in
their
huts
or
working
in
factories
and
mines
the
cries
of
the
old
and
the
children
wounded
by
bombs
from
zeppelins
the
wails
of
the
mothers
for
their
sons
the
very
rustling
of
the
air
as
the
souls
of
the
ten
million
dead
sweep
to
another
world
why
must
all
these
horrors
come
upon
a
fair
green
earth
where
we
believed
that
love
and
help
and
friendship
genius
and
science
and
commerce
religion
and
civilisation
once
ruled
it
is
because
in
the
dark
cold
northern
plains
of
germany
there
exists
an
autocracy
deceiving
a
great
people
poisoning
their
minds
from
one
generation
to
another
and
preaching
the
virtue
and
necessity
of
war
and
until
that
autocracy
is
either
wiped
out
or
made
powerless
there
can
be
no
peace
on
earth
the
golden
dream
of
conquest
was
almost
accomplished
a
little
more
advance
a
few
more
wagon
loads
of
ammunition
and
there
would
have
been
no
battle
of
the
marne
no
joffre
a
modern
martel
to
hammer
back
the
invading
hordes
of
barbarism
i
have
always
stated
that
germany
is
possessed
yet
of
immense
military
power
and
to
win
the
nations
opposed
to
germany
must
learn
to
think
in
a
military
way
the
mere
entrance
even
of
a
great
nation
like
our
own
into
the
war
means
nothing
in
a
military
way
unless
backed
by
military
power
and
there
must
be
no
german
peace
the
old
left
in
control
of
germany
of
bulgaria
of
turkey
would
only
seek
a
favourable
moment
to
renew
the
war
to
strive
again
for
the
mastery
of
the
world
fortunately
america
bars
the
way
america
led
by
a
fighting
president

win
allow
no

brutal
autocracy
