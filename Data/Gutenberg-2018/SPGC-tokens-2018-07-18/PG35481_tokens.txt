dedication
to
the
honorable
henry
a
wise
dear
sir
i
dedicate
this
work
to
you
because
i
am
acquainted
with
no
one
who
has
so
zealously
laboriously
and
successfully
endeavored
to
virginianise
virginia
by
encouraging
through
state
legislation
her
intellectual
and
physical
growth
and
development
no
one
who
has
seen
so
clearly
the
evils
of
centralization
from
without
and
worked
so
earnestly
to
cure
or
avert
those
evils
by
building
up
centralization
within
virginia
should
have
her
centres
of
thought
at
her
colleges
and
her
university
centres
of
trade
and
manufactures
at
her
seaboard
and
western
towns
and
centres
of
fashion
at
her
mineral
springs
i
agree
with
you
too
that
state
strength
and
state
independence
are
the
best
guarantees
of
state
rights
and
that
policy
the
wisest
which
most
promotes
the
growth
of
state
strength
and
independence
weakness
invites
aggression
strength
commands
respect
hence
the
union
is
safest
when
its
separate
members
are
best
able
to
repel
injury
or
to
live
independently
your
attachment
to
virginia
has
not
lessened
your
love
for
the
union
in
urging
forward
to
completion
such
works
as
the
covington
and
ohio
road
you
are
trying
to
add
to
the
wealth
the
glory
and
the
strength
of
our
own
state
whilst
you
would
add
equally
to
the
wealth
the
strength
and
perpetuity
of
the
union
i
can
not
commit
you
to
all
the
doctrines
of
my
book
for
you
will
not
see
it
until
it
is
published
with
very
great
respect
your
obedient
servant
geo
fitzhugh
royal
preface
i
have
endeavored
in
this
work
to
treat
the
subjects
of
liberty
and
slavery
in
a
more
rigidly
analytical
manner
than
in
sociology
for
the
south
and
at
the
same
time
to
furnish
the
reader
with
abundance
of
facts
authorities
and
admissions
whereby
to
test
the
truth
of
my
views
my
chief
aim
has
been
to
shew
that
makes
values
and
wit
exploitates
and
accumulates
and
hence
to
deduce
the
conclusion
that
the
unrestricted
exploitation
of
free
society
is
more
oppressive
to
the
laborer
than
domestic
slavery
in
making
a
distinct
onslaught
on
the
popular
doctrines
of
modern
ethics
i
must
share
the
credit
or
censure
with
my
corresponding
acquaintance
and
friend
professor
of
virginia
our
acquaintance
commenced
by
his
congratulating
me
by
letter
on
the
announcement
that
i
was
occupied
with
a
treatise
vindicating
the
institution
of
slavery
in
the
abstract
and
by
his
suggestion
that
he
foresaw
from
what
he
had
read
of
my
communications
to
the
papers
that
i
should
be
compelled
to
make
a
general
assault
on
the
prevalent
political
and
moral
philosophy
this
letter
and
others
subsequent
to
it
together
with
the
reception
of
my
book
by
the
southern
public
have
induced
me
in
the
present
work
to
avow
the
full
breadth
and
scope
of
my
purpose
i
am
sure
it
will
be
easier
to
convince
the
world
that
the
customary
theories
of
our
modern
ethical
philosophy
whether
utilitarian
or
sentimental
are
so
fallacious
or
so
false
in
their
premises
and
their
deductions
as
to
deserve
rejection
than
to
persuade
it
that
the
social
forms
under
which
it
lives
and
attempts
to
justify
and
approve
are
equally
erroneous
and
should
be
by
others
founded
on
a
broader
philosophical
system
and
more
christian
principles
yet
i
believe
that
under
the
banners
of
socialism
and
more
dangerous
because
more
delusive
society
is
insensibly
and
often
unconsciously
marching
to
the
utter
abandonment
of
the
most
essential
institutions
religion
family
ties
property
and
the
restraints
of
justice
the
present
profession
is
indeed
to
stop
at
the
house
of
and
free
love
but
we
are
sure
that
it
can
not
halt
and
encamp
in
such
quarters
society
will
work
out
erroneous
doctrines
to
their
logical
consequences
and
detect
error
only
by
the
experience
of
mischief
the
world
will
only
fall
back
on
domestic
slavery
when
all
other
social
forms
have
failed
and
been
exhausted
that
hour
may
not
be
far
off
will
not
see
this
work
before
its
publication
and
would
dissent
from
many
of
its
details
from
the
unrestricted
latitude
of
its
positions
and
from
its
want
of
precise
definition
the
time
has
not
yet
arrived
in
my
opinion
for
such
precision
nor
will
it
arrive
until
the
present
philosophy
is
seen
to
be
untenable
and
we
begin
to
look
about
us
for
a
loftier
and
more
enlightened
substitute
introduction
in
our
little
work
sociology
for
the
south
we
said
we
may
again
appear
in
the
character
of
writer
before
the
public
but
we
shall
not
intrude
and
would
prefer
that
others
should
finish
the
work
which
we
have
begun
that
little
work
has
met
every
where
we
believe
at
the
south
with
a
favorable
reception
no
one
has
denied
its
theory
of
free
society
nor
disputed
the
facts
on
which
that
theory
rests
very
many
able
have
arisen
and
many
books
and
essays
are
daily
appearing
taking
higher
ground
in
defence
of
slavery
justifying
it
as
a
normal
and
natural
institution
instead
of
excusing
or
apologizing
for
it
as
an
exceptional
one
it
is
now
treated
as
a
positive
good
not
a
necessary
evil
the
success
not
the
ability
of
our
essay
may
have
had
some
influence
in
eliciting
this
new
mode
of
defence
we
have
for
many
years
been
gradually
and
cautiously
testing
public
opinion
at
the
south
and
have
ascertained
that
it
is
ready
to
approve
and
much
prefers
the
highest
ground
of
defence
we
have
no
peculiar
fitness
for
the
work
we
are
engaged
in
except
the
confidence
that
we
address
a
public
predisposed
to
approve
our
doctrines
however
bold
or
novel
heretofore
the
great
difficulty
in
defending
slavery
has
arisen
from
the
fear
that
the
public
would
take
offence
at
assaults
on
its
political
axioms
which
nevertheless
stood
in
the
way
of
that
defence
it
is
now
evident
that
those
axioms
have
outlived
their
day
for
no
one
either
north
or
south
has
complained
of
our
rather
ferocious
assault
on
them
much
less
attempted
to
reply
to
or
refute
our
arguments
and
objections
all
men
begin
very
clearly
to
perceive
that
the
state
of
revolution
is
politically
and
socially
abnormal
and
exceptional
and
that
the
principles
that
would
justify
it
are
true
in
the
particular
false
in
the
general
a
recurrence
to
fundamental
principles
by
an
oppressed
people
is
treason
if
it
fails
the
noblest
of
heroism
if
it
eventuates
in
successful
revolution
but
a
frequent
recurrence
to
fundamental
principles
is
at
war
with
the
continued
existence
of
all
government
and
is
a
doctrine
fit
to
be
sported
only
by
the
isms
of
the
north
and
the
red
republicans
of
europe
with
them
no
principles
are
considered
established
and
sacred
nor
will
ever
be
when
in
time
of
revolution
society
is
partially
disbanded
disintegrated
and
dissolved
the
doctrine
of
human
equality
may
have
a
hearing
and
may
be
useful
in
stimulating
rebellion
but
it
is
practically
impossible
and
directly
conflicts
with
all
government
all
separate
property
and
all
social
existence
we
cite
these
two
examples
as
instances
to
shew
how
the
wisest
and
best
of
men
are
sure
to
deduce
as
general
principles
what
is
only
true
as
to
themselves
and
their
peculiar
circumstances
never
were
people
blessed
with
such
wise
and
noble
institutions
as
we
for
they
combine
most
that
was
good
in
those
of
rome
and
greece
of
judea
and
of
mediæval
england
but
the
mischievous
absurdity
of
our
political
axioms
and
principles
quite
equals
the
wisdom
and
conservatism
of
our
political
practices
the
ready
appreciation
by
the
public
of
such
doctrines
as
these
encourages
us
to
persevere
in
writing
the
silence
of
the
north
is
far
more
encouraging
however
than
the
approbation
of
the
south
piqued
and
taunted
for
two
years
by
many
southern
presses
of
high
standing
to
deny
the
proposition
that
free
society
in
western
europe
is
a
failure
and
that
it
betrays
premonitory
symptoms
of
failure
even
in
america
the
north
is
silent
and
thus
tacitly
admits
the
charge
challenged
to
compare
and
weigh
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
our
domestic
slavery
with
their
slavery
of
the
masses
to
capital
and
skill
it
is
mute
and
neither
accepts
nor
declines
our
challenge
the
comparative
evils
of
slave
society
and
of
free
society
of
slavery
to
human
masters
and
of
slavery
to
capital
are
the
issues
which
the
south
now
presents
and
which
the
north
avoids
and
she
avoids
them
because
the
abolitionists
the
only
assailants
of
southern
slavery
have
we
believe
to
a
man
asserted
the
entire
failure
of
their
own
social
system
proposed
its
subversion
and
suggested
an
approximating
millenium
or
some
system
of
free
love
communism
or
socialism
as
a
substitute
the
alarming
extent
of
this
state
of
public
opinion
or
to
speak
more
accurately
the
absence
of
any
public
opinion
or
common
faith
and
conviction
about
anything
is
not
dreamed
of
at
the
south
nor
fully
and
properly
realized
even
at
the
north
can
not
believe
what
is
so
entirely
different
from
all
our
experience
and
observation
and
have
become
familiarized
and
inattentive
to
the
infected
social
atmosphere
they
continually
inhale
besides
living
in
the
midst
of
the
isms
their
situation
is
not
favorable
for
comprehensive
observation
or
calm
generalization
more
than
a
year
since
we
made
a
short
trip
to
the
north
and
whilst
there
only
associated
with
distinguished
abolitionists
we
have
corresponded
much
with
them
before
and
since
and
read
many
of
their
books
lectures
essays
and
speeches
we
have
neither
seen
nor
heard
any
denial
by
them
of
the
failure
of
their
own
social
system
but
in
the
contrary
found
that
they
all
concurred
in
the
necessity
of
radical
social
changes
is
true
in
conversation
they
will
say
our
system
of
society
is
bad
but
yours
of
the
south
is
worse
the
cause
of
social
science
is
advancing
and
we
are
ready
to
institute
a
system
better
than
either
we
could
give
many
private
anecdotes
and
quote
thousands
of
authorities
to
prove
that
such
is
the
exact
state
of
opinion
with
the
multitudinous
isms
of
the
north
the
correctness
of
our
statement
will
not
be
denied
if
it
is
any
one
may
satisfy
himself
of
its
truth
by
reading
any
abolition
or
infidel
paper
at
the
north
for
a
single
month
the
liberator
of
boston
their
ablest
paper
gives
continually
the
fullest
exposé
of
their
opinions
and
of
their
wholesale
destructiveness
of
purpose
the
neglect
of
the
north
to
take
issue
with
us
or
with
the
southern
press
in
the
new
positions
which
we
have
assumed
our
own
observations
of
the
working
of
northern
society
the
alarming
increase
of
socialism
as
evinced
by
its
control
of
many
northern
state
legislatures
and
its
majority
in
the
lower
house
of
congress
are
all
new
proofs
of
the
truth
of
our
doctrine
the
character
of
that
majority
in
congress
is
displayed
in
full
relief
by
the
single
fact
which
we
saw
stated
in
a
northern
abolition
paper
that
there
are
a
hundred
spiritual
rappers
in
congress
a
northern
member
of
congress
made
a
similar
remark
to
us
a
few
days
since
is
but
a
copy
of
the
hiss
legislature
of
massachusetts
or
the
parliament
of
england
further
study
too
of
western
european
society
which
has
been
engaged
in
continual
revolution
for
twenty
years
has
satisfied
us
that
free
society
every
where
begets
isms
and
that
isms
soon
beget
bloody
revolutions
until
our
trip
to
the
north
we
did
not
justly
appreciate
the
passage
which
we
are
about
to
quote
from
carlyle
pamphlets
now
it
seems
to
us
as
if
boston
new
haven
or
western
new
york
had
set
for
the
picture
to
rectify
the
relation
that
exists
between
two
men
is
there
no
method
then
but
that
of
ending
it
the
old
relation
has
become
unsuitable
obsolete
perhaps
unjust
and
the
remedy
is
abolish
it
let
there
henceforth
be
no
relation
at
all
from
the
of
marriage
downwards
human
beings
used
to
be
manifoldly
related
one
to
another
and
each
to
all
and
there
was
no
relation
among
human
beings
just
or
unjust
that
had
not
its
grievances
and
its
difficulties
its
necessities
on
both
sides
to
bear
and
forbear
but
henceforth
be
it
known
we
have
changed
all
that
by
favor
of
heaven
the
principle
has
come
up
which
will
itself
do
the
business
for
us
and
now
let
a
new
sacrament
that
of
which
we
call
emancipation
and
spout
of
on
our
platforms
be
universally
the
order
of
the
day
have
men
considered
whither
all
this
is
tending
and
what
it
certainly
enough
betokens
cut
every
human
relation
that
has
any
where
grown
uneasy
sheer
asunder
reduce
whatsoever
was
compulsory
to
voluntary
whatsoever
was
permanent
among
us
to
the
condition
of
the
nomadic
in
other
words
loosen
by
assiduous
wedges
in
every
joint
the
whole
fabrice
of
social
existence
stone
from
stone
till
at
last
all
lie
now
quite
loose
enough
it
can
as
we
already
see
in
most
countries
be
overset
by
sudden
outburst
of
revolutionary
rage
and
lying
as
mere
mountains
of
anarchic
rubbish
solicit
you
to
sing
fraternity
over
it
and
rejoice
in
the
now
remarkable
era
of
human
progress
we
have
arrived
at
now
we
plant
ourselves
on
this
passage
from
carlyle
we
say
that
as
far
as
it
goes
is
a
faithful
picture
of
the
isms
of
the
north
but
the
restraints
of
law
and
public
opinion
are
less
at
the
north
than
in
europe
the
isms
on
each
side
the
atlantic
are
equally
busy
with
assiduous
wedges
in
loosening
in
every
joint
the
whole
fabric
of
social
existence
but
whilst
they
dare
invoke
anarchy
in
europe
they
dare
not
inaugurate
new
york
free
love
and
oneida
incest
and
mormon
polygamy
the
moral
religious
and
social
heresies
of
the
north
are
more
monstrous
than
those
of
europe
the
pupil
has
surpassed
the
master
unaided
by
the
stimulants
of
poverty
hunger
and
nakedness
which
urge
the
master
forward
society
need
not
fail
in
the
until
the
whole
west
is
settled
and
a
refluent
population

despite
of
appearing

and
egotistical
we
can
not
refrain
from
mentioning
another
circumstance
that
encourages
us
to
write
at
the
very
time
when
we
were
writing
our
pamphlet
entitled
slavery
justified
in
which
we
took
ground
that
free
society
had
failed
carlyle
began
to
write
his
pamphlets
whose
very
title
is
the
assertion
of
the
failure
of
free
society
the
proof
derived
from
this
coincidence
becomes
the
stronger
when
it
is
perceived
that
an
ordinary
man
on
this
side
the
atlantic
discovered
and
was
exposing
the
same
social
phenomena
that
an
extraordinary
one
had
discovered
and
was
exposing
on
the
other
the
very
titles
of
our
works
are
synonymous
for
the
latter
day
is
the
failure
of
society
carlyle
and
miss
fanny
wright
in
her
england
the
civilizer
vindicate
slavery
by
shewing
that
each
of
its
apparent
relaxations
in
england
has
injured
the
laboring
class
they
were
fully
and
ably
represented
in
parliament
by
their
ancient
masters
the
barons
since
the
throne
and
the
church
and
the
nobility
have
been
stripped
of
their
power
and
a
house
of
commons
representing
lands
and
money
rules
despotically
the
masses
have
become
outlawed
they
labor
under
all
the
disadvantages
of
slavery
and
have
none
of
the
rights
of
slaves
this
is
the
true
history
of
the
english
constitution
and
one
which
we
intend
in
the
sequel
more
fully
to
expound
this
presents
another
reason
why
we
again
appear
before
the
public
blackstone
which
is
read
by
most
american
gentlemen
teaches
a
doctrine
the
exact
reverse
of
this
and
that
doctrine
we
shall
try
to
refute
returning
from
the
north
we
procured
in
new
york
a
copy
of
politics
and
economics
to
our
surprise
we
found
that
our
theory
of
the
origin
of
society
was
identical
with
his
and
that
we
had
employed
not
only
the
same
illustrations
but
the
very
same
words
we
saw
at
once
that
the
true
vindication
of
slavery
must
be
founded
on
his
theory
of
man
social
nature
as
opposed
to
locke
theory
of
the
social
contract
on
which
latter
free
society
rests
for
support
is
true
we
had
broached
this
doctrine
but
with
the
world
at
large
our
authority
was
merely
repulsive
whilst
the
same
doctrine
coming
from
aristotle
had
besides
his
name
two
thousand
years
of
human
approval
and
concurrence
in
its
favor
for
without
that
concurrence
and
approval
his
book
would
have
long
since
perished
in
addition
to
all
this
we
think
we
have
discovered
that
moses
has
anticipated
the
socialists
and
that
in
prohibiting
usury
of
money
and
of
victuals
and
of
all
things
that
are
lent
on
usury
and
in
denouncing
increase
he
was
far
wiser
than
aristotle
and
saw
that
other
capital
or
property
did
not
breed
any
more
than
money
and
that
its
profits
were
unjust
exactions
levied
from
the
laboring
man
the
socialists
proclaim
this
as
a
discovery
of
their
own
we
think
moses
discovered
and
proclaimed
it
more
than
three
thousand
years
ago
and
that
it
is
the
only
true
theory
of
capital
and
labor
the
only
adequate
theoretical
defence
of
slavery
for
it
proves
that
the
profits
which
capital
exacts
from
labor
makes
free
laborers
slaves
without
the
rights
privileges
or
advantages
of
domestic
slaves
and
capitalists
their
masters
with
all
the
advantages
and
none
of
the
burdens
and
obligations
of
the
ordinary
owners
of
slaves
the
scientific
title
of
this
work
would
be
best
expressed
by
the
conventional
french
term
we
endeavor
to
translate
by
the
double
periphrases
of
cannibals
all
or
slaves
without
masters
we
have
been
imprudent
enough
to
write
our
introduction
first
and
may
fail
to
satisfy
the
expectations
which
we
excite
our
excess
of
candor
must
in
that
event
in

chapter
i
the
universal
trade
we
are
all
north
and
south
engaged
in
the
white
slave
trade
and
he
who
succeeds
best
is
esteemed
most
respectable
it
is
far
more
cruel
than
the
black
slave
trade
because
it
exacts
more
of
its
slaves
and
neither
protects
nor
governs
them
we
boast
that
it
exacts
more
when
we
say
that
the
made
from
employing
free
labor
are
greater
than
those
from
slave
labor
the
profits
made
from
free
labor
are
the
amount
of
the
products
of
such
labor
which
the
employer
by
means
of
the
command
which
capital
or
skill
gives
him
takes
away
exacts
or
exploitates
from
the
free
laborer
the
profits
of
slave
labor
are
that
portion
of
the
products
of
such
labor
which
the
power
of
the
master
enables
him
to
appropriate
these
profits
are
less
because
the
master
allows
the
slave
to
retain
a
larger
share
of
the
results
of
his
own
labor
than
do
the
employers
of
free
labor
but
we
not
only
boast
that
the
white
slave
trade
is
more
exacting
and
fraudulent
in
fact
though
not
in
intention
than
black
slavery
but
we
also
boast
that
it
is
more
cruel
in
leaving
the
laborer
to
take
care
of
himself
and
family
out
of
the
pittance
which
skill
or
capital
have
allowed
him
to
retain
when
the
day
labor
is
ended
he
is
free
but
is
overburdened
with
the
cares
of
family
and
household
which
make
his
freedom
an
empty
and
delusive
mockery
but
his
employer
is
really
free
and
may
enjoy
the
profits
made
by
others
labor
without
a
care
or
a
trouble
as
to
their
the
negro
slave
is
free
too
when
the
labors
of
the
day
are
over
and
free
in
mind
as
well
as
body
for
the
master
provides
food
raiment
house
fuel
and
everything
else
necessary
to
the
physical
of
himself
and
family
the
master
labors
commence
just
when
the
slave
end
no
wonder
men
should
prefer
white
slavery
to
capital
to
negro
slavery
since
it
is
more
profitable
and
is
free
from
all
the
cares
and
labors
of
black
now
reader
it
you
wish
to
know
yourself
to
descant
on
your
own
deformity
read
on
but
if
you
would
cherish
or
throw
down
our
book
for
we
will
dispel
illusions
which
have
promoted
your
happiness
and
shew
you
that
what
you
have
considered
and
practiced
as
virtue
is
little
better
than
moral
cannibalism
but
you
will
find
yourself
in
numerous
and
respectable
company
for
all
good
and
respectable
people
are
cannibals
all
who
do
not
labor
or
who
are
successfully
trying
to
live
without
labor
on
the
unrequited
labor
of
other
people
whilst
low
bad
and
disreputable
people
are
those
who
labor
to
support
themselves
and
to
support
said
respectable
people
besides
throwing
the
negro
slaves
out
of
the
account
and
society
is
divided
in
christendom
into
four
classes
the
rich
or
independent
respectable
people
who
live
well
and
labor
not
at
all
the
professional
and
skillful
respectable
people
who
do
a
little
light
work
for
enormous
wages
the
poor
people
who
support
every
body
and
starve
themselves
and
the
poor
thieves
swindlers
and
sturdy
beggars
who
live
like
gentlemen
without
labor
on
the
labor
of
other
people
the
gentlemen
exploitate
which
being
done
on
a
large
scale
and
requiring
a
great
many
victims
is
highly
respectable
whilst
the
rogues
and
beggars
take
so
little
from
others
that
they
fare
little
better
than
those
who
labor
but
reader
we
do
not
wish
to
fire
into
the
flock
thou
art
the
man
you
are
a
cannibal
and
if
a
successful
one
pride
yourself
on
the
number
of
your
victims
quite
as
much
as
any
feejee
chieftain
who
breakfasts
dines
and
sups
on
human
and
your
conscience
smites
you
if
you
have
failed
to
succeed
quite
as
much
as
his
when
he
returns
from
an
unsuccessful
foray
probably
you
are
a
lawyer
or
a
merchant
or
a
doctor
who
have
made
by
your
business
fifty
thousand
dollars
and
retired
to
live
on
your
capital
but
mark
not
to
spend
your
capital
that
would
be
vulgar
disreputable
criminal
that
would
be
to
live
by
your
own
labor
for
your
capital
is
your
amassed
labor
that
would
be
to
do
as
common
working
men
do
for
they
take
the
pittance
which
their
employees
leave
them
to
live
on
they
live
by
labor
for
they
exchange
the
results
of
their
own
labor
for
the
products
of
other
people
labor
it
is
no
doubt
an
honest
vulgar
way
of
living
but
not
at
all
a
respectable
way
the
respectable
way
of
living
is
to
make
other
people
work
for
you
and
to
pay
them
nothing
for
so
doing
and
to
have
no
concern
about
them
after
their
work
is
done
hence
white
is
much
more
respectable
than
negro
slavery
for
the
master
works
nearly
as
hard
for
the
negro
as
he
for
the
master
but
you
my
virtuous
respectable
reader
exact
three
thousand
dollars
per
annum
from
white
labor
for
your
income
is
the
product
of
white
labor
and
make
not
one
cent
of
return
in
any
form
you
retain
your
capital
and
never
labor
and
yet
live
in
luxury
on
the
labor
of
others
capital
commands
labor
as
the
master
does
the
slave
neither
pays
for
labor
but
the
master
permits
the
slave
to
retain
a
larger
allowance
from
the
proceeds
of
his
own
labor
and
hence
free
labor
is
cheaper
than
slave
labor
you
with
the
command
over
labor
which
your
capital
gives
you
are
a
slave
owner
a
master
without
the
obligations
of
a
master
they
who
work
for
you
who
create
your
income
are
slaves
without
the
rights
of
slaves
slaves
without
a
master
whilst
you
were
engaged
in
amassing
your
capital
in
seeking
to
become
independent
you
were
in
the
white
slave
trade
to
become
independent
is
to
be
able
to
make
other
people
support
you
without
being
obliged
to
labor
for
now
what
man
in
society
is
not
seeking
to
attain
this
situation
he
who
attains
it
is
a
slave
owner
in
the
worst
sense
he
who
is
in
pursuit
of
it
is
engaged
in
the
slave
trade
you
reader
belong
to
the
one
or
other
class
the
men
without
property
in
free
society
are
theoretically
in
a
worse
condition
than
slaves
practically
their
condition
corresponds
with
this
theory
as
history
and
statistics
every
where
demonstrate
the
capitalists
in
free
society
live
in
ten
times
the
luxury
and
show
that
southern
masters
do
because
the
slaves
to
capital
work
harder
and
cost
less
than
negro
slaves
the
negro
slaves
of
the
south
are
the
happiest
and
in
some
sense
the
freest
people
in
the
world
the
children
and
the
aged
and
infirm
work
not
at
all
and
yet
have
all
the
comforts
and
necessaries
of
life
provided
for
them
they
enjoy
liberty
because
they
are
oppressed
neither
by
care
nor
labor
the
women
do
little
hard
work
and
are
protected
from
the
despotism
of
their
husbands
by
their
masters
the
negro
men
and
stout
boys
work
on
the
average
in
good
weather
not
more
than
nine
hours
a
day
the
balance
of
their
time
is
spent
in
perfect
abandon
besides
they
have
their
sabbaths
and
holidays
white
men
with
so
much
of
license
and
liberty
would
die
of
ennui
but
negroes
luxuriate
in
corporeal
and
mental
repose
with
their
faces
upturned
to
the
sun
they
can
sleep
at
any
hour
and
quiet
sleep
is
the
greatest
of
human
enjoyments
blessed
be
the
man
who
invented
sleep
is
happiness
in
itself
and
results
from
contentment
with
the
present
and
confident
assurance
of
the
future
we
do
not
know
whether
free
laborers
ever
sleep
they
are
fools
to
do
so
for
whilst
they
sleep
the
wily
and
watchful
capitalist
is
devising
means
to
ensnare
and
exploitate
them
the
free
laborer
must
work
or
starve
he
is
more
of
a
slave
than
the
negro
because
he
works
longer
and
harder
for
less
allowance
than
the
slave
and
has
no
holiday
because
the
cares
of
life
with
him
begin
when
its
labors
end
he
has
no
liberty
and
not
a
single
right
we
know
often
said
air
and
water
are
common
property
which
all
have
equal
right
to
participate
and
enjoy
but
this
is
utterly
false
the
appropriation
of
the

carries
with
it
the
appropriation
of
all
on

above
the

ad

a
man
can
not
breathe
the
air
without
a
place

it
from
and
all
places
are

all
water
is
private
property
to
the
middle
of

and
that
is
not

free
laborers
have
not
a
thousandth
part
of
the
rights
and
liberties
of
negro
slaves
indeed
they
have
not
a
single
right
or
a
single
liberty
unless
it
be
the
right
or
liberty
to
die
but
the
reader
may
think
that
he
and
other
capitalists
and
employers
are
freer
than
negro
slaves
your
capital
would
soon
vanish
if
you
dared
indulge
in
the
liberty
and
abandon
of
negroes
you
hold
your
wealth
and
position
by
the
tenure
of
constant
watchfulness
care
and
circumspection
you
never
labor
but
you
are
never
free
where
a
few
own
the
soil
they
have
unlimited
power
over
the
balance
of
society
until
domestic
slavery
comes
in
to
compel
them
to
permit
this
balance
of

to
draw
a
sufficient

comfortable
living
from

free

asserts
the

slavery
maintains
that

well
may
you
follow
the

it
is
the
only

worth
following
and

the

worth

all

a

as
it

give

if

your

you

labor

compare
the
evils
of
domestic
slavery
with
the
evils
of
liberty
without
property
it
entered
no
one
head
to
conceive
a
doubt
as
to
the
actual
freedom
of
the
emancipated
the
relations
of
capital
and
labor
of
the
to
the
were
things
about
which
no
one
had
thought
or
written
it
never
occurred
to
either
the
enemies
or
the
apologists
for
slavery
that
if
no
one
would
employ
the
free
laborer
his
condition
was
infinitely
worse
than
that
of
actual
slavery
nor
did
it
occur
to
them
that
if
his
wages
were
less
than
the
allowance
of
the
slave
he
was
less
free
after
emancipation
than
before
simon
fourier
owen
fanny
wright
and
a
few
others
who
discovered
and
proclaimed
that
property
was
not
only
a
bad
master
but
an
intolerable
one
were
treated
as
wicked
visionaries
after
the
french
and
other
revolutions
in
western
europe
in
all
men
suddenly
discovered
that
the
social
relations
of
men
were
false
and
that
social
not
political
revolutions
were
needed
since
that
period
almost
the
whole
literature
of
free
society
is
but
a
voice
proclaiming
its
absolute
and
total
failure
hence
the
works
of
the
socialists
contain
the
true
defence
of
slavery
most
of
the
active
intellect
of
christendom
has
for
the
last
twenty
years
been
engaged
in
analyzing
detecting
and
exposing
the
existing
relations
of
labor
skill
and
capital
and
in
vain
efforts
to
rectify
those
relations
the
philosophers
of
europe
who
have
been
thus
engaged
have
excelled
all
the
moral
philosophers
that
preceded
them
in
the
former
part
of
their
pursuit
but
suggested
nothing
but
puerile
absurdities
in
the
latter
their
destructive
philosophy
is
profound
demonstrative
and
unanswerable
their
constructive
theories
wild
visionary
and
chimerical
on
paper
and
failures
in
practice
each
one
of
them
proves
clearly
enough
that
the
present
edifice
of
european
society
is
out
of
all
rule
and
proportion
and
must
soon
tumble
to
pieces
but
no
two
agree
as
to
how
it
is
to
be
we
must
say
they
all
have
a
new
world
if
we
are
to
have
any
world
at
all
and
each
has
a
little
model
utopia
or
phalanstery
for
this
new
and
better
world
which
having
already
failed
on
a
small
experimental
scale
the
inventor
assures
us
is
therefore
the
very
thing
to
succeed
on
a
large
one
we
allude
to
the
socialists
and
communists
who
have
more
or
less
tinged
all
modern
literature
with
their
doctrines
in
analyzing
society
in
detecting
exposing
and
generalizing
its
operations
and
its
various
phenomena
they
are
but
grammarians
or
anatomists
confining
philosophy
to
its
proper
sphere
and
employing
it
for
useful
purposes
when
they
attempt
to
go
further
and
having
found
the
present
social
system
to
be
fatally
diseased
propose
to
originate
and
build
up
another
in
its
stead
they
are
as
presumptuous
as
the
anatomist
who
should
attempt
to
create
a
man
social
bodies
like
human
bodies
are
the
works
of
god
which
man
may
dissect
and
sometimes
heal
but
which
he
can
not
create
society
was
not
always
thus
diseased
or
socialism
would
have
been
as
common
in
the
past
as
it
is
now
we
think
these
presumptuous
philosophers
had
best
compare
it
in
its
healthy
state
with
what
it
is
now
and
supply
deficiencies
or
lop
off
excrescencies
as
the
comparison
may
suggest
but
our
present
business
is
to
call
attention
to
some
valuable
discoveries
in
the
terra
firma
of
social
science
which
these
socialists
have
made
in
their
vain
voyages
in
search
of
an
ever
receding
and
illusory
utopia
like
the
alchymists
although
they
have
signally
failed
in
the
objects
of
their
pursuits
they
have
incidentally
hit
upon
truths
unregarded
and
unprized
by
themselves
which
will
be
valuable
in
the
hands
of
more
practical
and
less
sanguine
men
it
is
remarkable
that
the
political
economists
who
generally
assume
labor
to
be
the
most
just
and
correct
measure
of
value
should
not
have
discovered
that
the
profits
of
capital
represent
no
labor
at
all
to
be
consistent
the
political
economists
should
denounce
as
unjust
all
interests
rents
dividends
and
other
profits
of
capital
we
mean
by
rents
that
portion
of
the
rent
which
is
strictly
income
the
amount
annually
required
for
repairs
and
ultimately
to
rebuild
the
house
is
not
profit
four
per
cent
will
do
this
a
rent
of
ten
per
cent
is
in
such
case
a
profit
of
six
per
cent
the
four
per
cent
is
but
a
return
to
the
builder
of
his
labor
and
capital
spent
in
building
the
use
of
a
thing
is
only
a
fair
subject
of
change
in
so
far
as
the
article
used
is
consumed
in
the
use
for
such
consumption
is
the
consumption
of
the
labor
or
capital
of
the
owner
and
is
but
the
exchange
of
equivalent
amounts
of
labor
these
socialists
having
discovered
that
skill
and
capital
by
means
of
free
competition
exercise
an
undue
mastery
over
labor
propose
to
do
away
with
skill
capital
and
free
competition
altogether
they
would
heal
the
diseases
of
society
by
destroying
its
most
vital
functions
having
laid
down
the
broad
proposition
that
equal
amounts
of
labor
or
their
results
should
be
exchanged
for
each
other
they
get
at
the
conclusion
that
as
the
profits
of
capital
are
not
the
results
of
labor
the
capitalist
shall
be
denied
all
interest
or
rents
or
other
profits
on
his
capital
and
be
compelled
in
all
cases
to
exchange
a
part
of
the
capital
itself
for
labor
or
its
results
this
would
prevent
accumulation
or
at
least
limit
it
to
the
procurement
of
the
coarsest
necessaries
of
life
they
say
the
lawyer
and
the
artist
do
not
work
so
hard
and
continuously
as
the
ploughman
and
should
receive
less
wages
than
he
a
bushel
of
wheat
represents
as
much
labor
as
a
speech
or
portrait
and
should
be
exchanged
for
the
one
or
the
other
such
a
system
of
trade
and
exchange
would
equalize
conditions
but
would
banish
civilization
yet
do
these
men
show
that
by
means
of
the
taxation
and
oppression
which
capital
and
skill
exercise
over
labor
the
rich
the
professional
the
trading
and
skillful
part
of
society
have
become
the
masters
of
the
laboring
masses
whose
condition
already
intolerable
is
daily
becoming
worse
they
point
out
distinctly
the
character
of
the
disease
under
which
the
patient
is
laboring
but
see
no
way
of
curing
the
disease
except
by
killing
the
patient
in
the
preceding
chapter
we
illustrated
their
theory
of
capital
by
a
single
example
we
might
give
hundreds
of
illustrations
and
yet
the
subject
is
so
difficult
that
few
readers
will
take
the
trouble
to
understand
it
let
us
take
two
well
known
historical
instances
england
became
possessed
of
two
fine
islands
ireland
and
jamaica
englishmen
took
away
or
defrauded
from
the
irish
their
lands
but
professed
to
leave
the
people
free
the
people
however
must
have
the
use
of
land
or
starve
the
english
charged
them
in
rent
so
much
that
their
allowance
after
deducting
that
rent
was
not
half
that
of
jamaica
slaves
they
were
compelled
to
labor
for
their
landlords
by
the
fear
of
hunger
and
death
forces
stronger
than
the
overseer
lash
they
worked
more
and
did
not
get
half
so
much
pay
or
allowance
as
the
jamaica
negroes
all
the
reports
to
the
french
and
british
parliaments
show
that
the
physical
wants
of
the
west
india
slaves
were
well
supplied
the
irish
became
the
subjects
of
capital
slaves
with
no
masters
obliged
by
law
or
domestic
affections
to
provide
for
them
the
freest
people
in
the
world
in
the
loose
and
common
sense
of
words
their
condition
moral
physical
and
religious
was
far
worse
than
that
of
civilized
slaves
ever
has
been
or
ever
can
be
for
at
length
after
centuries
of
slow
starvation
three
hundred
thousand
perished
in
a
single
season
for
want
of
food
englishmen
took
the
lands
of
jamaica
also
but
introduced
negro
slaves
whom
they
were
compelled
to
support
at
all
seasons
and
at
any
cost
the
negroes
were
comfortable
until
philanthropy
taxed
the
poor
of
england
and
ireland
a
hundred
millions
to
free
them
now
they
enjoy
irish
liberty
whilst
the
english
hold
all
the
good
lands
they
are
destitute
and
savage
and
in
all
respects
worse
off
than
when
in
slavery
public
opinion
unites
with
domestic
affection
and
municipal
law
to
protect
the
slave
the
man
who
maltreats
the
weak
and
dependant
who
abuses
his
authority
over
wife
children
or
slaves
is
universally
detested
that
same
public
opinion
which
shields
and
protects
the
slave
encourages
the
oppression
of
free
laborers
for
it
is
considered
more
honorable
and
praiseworthy
to
obtain
large
fees
than
small
ones
to
make
good
bargains
than
bad
ones
and
all
fees
and
profits
come
ultimately
from
common
laborers
to
live
without
work
by
the
exactions
of
accumulated
capital
than
to
labor
at
the
plough
or
the
spade
for
one
living
it
is
the
interest
of
the
capitalist
and
the
skillful
to
allow
free
laborers
the
least
possible
portion
of
the
fruits
of
their
own
labor
for
all
capital
is
created
by
labor
and
the
smaller
the
allowance
of
the
free
laborer
the
greater
the
gains
of
his
employer
to
treat
free
laborers
badly
and
unfairly
is
universally
inculcated
as
a
moral
duty
and
the
selfishness
of
man
nature
prompts
him
to
the
most
rigorous
performance
of
this
cannibalish
duty
we
appeal
to
political
economy
the
ethical
social
political
and
economic
philosophy
of
free
society
to
prove
the
truth
of
our
doctrines
as
an
ethical
and
social
guide
that
philosophy
teaches
that
social
individual
and
national
competition
is
a
moral
duty
and
we
have
attempted
to
prove
that
all
competition
is
but
the
effort
to
enslave
others
without
being
encumbered
with
their
support
as
a
political
guide
it
would
simply
have
government
the
peace
or
to
define
its
doctrine
more
exactly
it
teaches
that
it
is
the
whole
duty
of
government
to
hold
the
weak
whilst
the
strong
rob
them
for
it
punishes
crimes
accompanied
with
force
which
none
but
the
commit
but
encourages
the
war
of
the
wits
in
which
the
strong
and
astute
are
sure
to
succeed
in
stripping
the
weak
and
ignorant
it
is
time
high
time
that
political
economy
was
banished
from
our
schools
but
what
would
this
avail
in
free
society
where
antagonistic
relations
suggest
to
each
one
without
a
teacher
that
he
can
only
be
just
to
himself
by
doing
wrong
to
others
aristotle
and
most
other
ancient
philosophers
and
statesmen
held
the
doctrine
that
as
money
would
not
breed
interest
should
not
be
allowed
moses
no
doubt
saw
as
the
modern
socialists
do
that
all
other
capital
stood
on
the
same
grounds
with
money
none
of
it
is
or
will
breed
the
language
employed
about
usury
and
increase
in
leviticus
and
deuteronomy
is
quite
broad
enough
to
embrace
and
prohibit
all
profits
of
capital
such
interest
or
increase
or
profits
might
be
charged
to
the
heathen
but
not
to
the
jews
the
whole
arrangements
of
moses
were
obviously
intended
to
prevent
competition
in
the
dealings
of
the
jews
with
one
another
and
to
beget
permanent
equality
of
condition
and
fraternal
feelings
the
socialists
have
done
one
great
good
they
enable
us
to
understand
and
appreciate
the
institutions
of
moses
and
to
see
that
none
but
divinity
could
have
originated
them
the
situation
of
judea
was
in
many
respects
anomalous
and
we
are
not
to
suppose
that
its
political
and
social
relations
were
intended
to
be
universal
yet
here
it
is
distinctly
asserted
that
under
certain
circumstances
all
profits
on
capital
are
wrong
the
reformers
of
the
present
day
are
all
teetotalists
and
attempt
to
banish
evil
altogether
not
to
lessen
or
restrict
it
it
would
be
wiser
to
assume
that
there
is
nothing
in
its
essence
evil
in
the
moral
or
physical
world
but
only
rendered
so
by
the
wrongful
applications
which
men
make
of
them
science
is
every
day
discovering
that
the
most
fatal
poisons
when
properly
employed
become
the
most
efficacious
medicines
so
what
appear
to
be
the
evil
passions
and
propensities
of
men
and
of
societies
under
proper
regulation
may
be
made
to
minister
to
the
wisest
and
best
of
purposes
civilized
society
has
never
been
found
without
that
competition
begotten
by
man
desire
to
throw
most
of
the
burdens
of
life
on
others
and
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
their
labors
without
exchanging
equivalent
labor
of
his
own
in
all
such
societies
outside
the
bible
such
selfish
and
grasping
appropriation
is
inculcated
as
a
moral
duty
and
he
who
succeeds
best
either
by
the
exercise
of
professional
skill
or
by
accumulation
of
capital
in
appropriating
the
labor
of
others
without
laboring
in
return
is
considered
most
meritorious
it
would
be
unfair
in
treating
of
the
relations
of
capital
and
labor
not
to
consider
its
system
the
ultimate
resort
of
the
poor
the
taxes
or
poor
rates
which
support
this
system
of
relief
like
all
other
taxes
and
values
are
derived
from
the
labor
of
the
poor
the
industrious
poor
are
compelled
by
the
rich
and
skillful
to
support
the
weak
and
too
often
the
idle
poor
in
addition
to
defraying
the
necessary
expenses
and
the
wanton
luxuries
of
the
rich
to
supporting
government
and
supporting
themselves
capital
compels
them
to
support
its
poor
houses
in
collection
of
the
poor
rates
in
their
distribution
and
in
the
administration
of
the
system
probably
half
the
tax
raised
for
the
poor
is
exhausted
of
the
remainder
possibly
another
half
is
expended
on
unworthy
objects
masters
in
like
manner
support
the
sick
infant
and
aged
slaves
from
the
labor
of
the
strong
and
healthy
but
nothing
is
wasted
in
collection
and
administration
and
nothing
given
to
unworthy
objects
the
master
having
the
control
of
the
objects
of
his
bounty
takes
care
that
they
shall
not
become
burdensome
by
their
own
crimes
and
idleness
it
is
contrary
to
all
human
customs
and
legal
analogies
that
those
who
are
dependent
or
are
likely
to
become
so
should
not
be
controlled
the
duty
of
protecting
the
weak
involves
the
necessity
of
enslaving
them
hence
in
all
countries
women
and
children
wards
and
apprentices
have
been
essentially
slaves
controlled
not
by
law
but
by
the
will
of
a
superior
this
is
a
fatal
defect
in
the
system
many
men
become
paupers
from
their
own
improvidence
or
misconduct
and
masters
alone
can
prevent
such
misconduct
and
improvidence
masters
treat
their
sick
infant
and
helpless
slaves
well
not
only
from
feeling
and
affection
but
from
motives
of
good
treatment
renders
them
more
valuable
all
poor
houses
are
administered
on
the
penitentiary
system
in
order
to
deter
the
poor
from
resorting
to
them
besides
masters
are
always
in
place
to
render
needful
aid
to
the
unfortunate
and
helpless
slaves
thousands
of
the
poor
starve
out
of
reach
of
the
poor
house
or
other
public
charity
a
common
charge
preferred
against
slavery
is
that
it
induces
idleness
with
the
masters
the
trouble
care
and
labor
of
providing
for
wife
children
and
slaves
and
of
properly
governing
and
administering
the
whole
affairs
of
the
farm
is
usually
borne
on
small
estates
by
the
master
on
larger
ones
he
is
aided
by
an
overseer
or
manager
if
they
do
their
duty
their
time
is
fully
occupied
if
they
do
not
the
estate
goes
to
ruin
the
mistress
on
southern
farms
is
usually
more
busily
usefully
and
benevolently
occupied
than
any
one
on
the
farm
she
unites
in
her
person
the
offices
of
wife
mother
mistress
housekeeper
and
sister
of
charity
and
she
fulfills
all
these
offices
admirably
well
the
rich
men
in
free
society
may
if
they
please
lounge
about
town
visit
clubs
attend
the
theatre
and
have
no
other
trouble
than
that
of
collecting
rents
interest
and
dividends
of
stock
in
a
well
constituted
slave
society
there
should
be
no
idlers
but
we
can
not
divine
how
the
capitalists
in
free
society
are
to
be
put
to
work
the
master
labors
for
the
slave
they
exchange
industrial
value
but
the
capitalist
living
on
his
income
gives
nothing
to
his
subjects
he
lives
by
mere
exploitation
it
is
objected
that
slavery
permits
or
induces
immorality
and
ignorance
this
is
a
mistake

bringing

in

an
admirable
educational
system
no
doubt
a
necessary
one
by
subjecting
them
to
the
constant
control
and
supervision
of
their
superiors
interested
in
enforcing
morality
it
becomes
the
best
and
most
efficient
police
system
so
efficient
that
the
ancient
romans
had
scarcely
any
criminal
code
whatever
the
great
objections
to
the
colonial
slavery
of
the
latter
romans
to
serfdom
and
all
forms
of
prædial
slavery
are
that
the
slaves
are
subjected
to
the
cares
as
well
as
the
labors
of
life
that
the
masters
become
idlers
that
want
of
intercourse
destroys
the
affectionate
relations
between
master
and
slave
throws
the
mass
of
ignorant
slaves
into
no
other
association
but
that
with
the
ignorant
and
deprives
them
as
well
of
the
instruction
as
the
government
of
superiors
living
on
the
same
farm
southern
slavery
is
becoming
the
best
form
of
slavery
of
which
we
have
any
history
except
that
of
the
jews
the
jews
owned
but
few
slaves
and
with
them
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
was
truly
affectionate
protective
and
patriarchal
the
master
wife
and
children
were
in
constant
intercourse
with
the
slaves
and
formed
in
practice
as
well
as
theory
affectionate
families
as
modern
civilization
advances
slavery
becomes
daily
more
necessary
because
its
tendency
is
to
accumulate
all
capital
in
a
few
hands
cuts
off
the
masses
from
the
soil
lessens
their
wages
and
their
chances
of
employment
and
increases
the
necessity
for
a
means
of
certain
subsistence
which
slavery
alone
can
furnish
when
a
few
own
all
the
lands
and
other
capital
christian
morality
can
find
little
practical
foothold
in
a
community
so
constituted
that
to
love
our
neighbor
as
ourself
or
to
do
unto
others
as
we
would
they
should
do
unto
us
would
be
acts
of
suicidal
christian
morality
however
was
not
preached
to
free
competitive
society
but
to
slave
society
where
it
is
neither
very
difficult
nor
unnatural
to
practice
it
in
the
various
family
relations
of
husband
wife
parent
child
master
and
slave
the
observance
of
these
christian
precepts
is
often
practiced
and
almost
always
promotes
the
temporal
well
being
of
those
who
observe
it
the
interests
of
the
various
members
of
the
family
circle
correctly
understood
concur
and
harmonize
and
each
member
best
promotes
his
own
selfish
interest
by
ministering
to
the
wants
and
interests
of
the
rest
two
great
stumbling
blocks
are
removed
from
the
acceptance
of
scripture
when
it
is
proved
that
slavery
which
it
recognizes
approves
and
enjoins
is
promotive
of
men
happiness
and
and
that
the
morality
which
it
inculcates
although
wholly
impracticable
in
free
society
is
readily
practised
in
that
form
of
society
to
which
it
was
addressed
we
do
not
conceive
that
there
can
be
any
other
moral
law
in
free
society
than
that
which
teaches
that
he
is
most
meritorious
who
most
wrongs
his
fellow
beings
for
any
other
law
would
make
men
martyrs
to
their
own
virtues
we
see
thousands
of
good
men
vainly
struggling
against
the
evil
necessities
of
their
situation
and
aggravating
by
their
charities
the
evils
which
they
would
cure
for
charity
in
free
society
is
but
the
tax
which
skill
and
capital
levy
from
the
working
poor
too
often
to
bestow
on
the
less
deserving
and
idle
poor
we
know
a
man
at
the
north
who
owns
millions
of
dollars
and
would
throw
every
cent
into
the
ocean
to
benefit
mankind
but
it
is
capital
and
place
it
where
he
will
it
becomes
an
engine
to
tax
and
oppress
the
laboring
poor
it
is
impossible
to
place
labor
and
capital
in
harmonious
or
friendly
relations
except
by
the
means
of
slavery
which
identifies
their
interests
would
that
gentleman
lay
his
capital
out
in
land
and
negroes
he
might
be
sure
in
whatever
hands
it
came
that
it
would
be
employed
to
protect
laborers
not
to
oppress
them
for
when
slaves
are
worth
near
a
thousand
dollars
a
head
they
will
be
carefully
and
well
provided
for
in
any
other
investment
he
may
make
of
it
it
will
be
used
as
an
engine
to
squeeze
the
largest
amount
of
labor
from
the
poor
for
the
least
amount
of
allowance
we
say
allowance
not
wages
for
neither
slaves
nor
free
laborers
get
wages
in
the
popular
sense
of
the
term
that
is
the
employer
or
capitalist

them
from
nothing
of
his
own
but
allows
them
a
part
generally
a
very
small
part
of
the
proceeds
of
their
own
labor
free
laborers

another

labor
creates
all
values
and

after
taking
the
lion
share
by
its
taxing
power
but

the
wages
of
one
laborer
from
the
proceeds
of
the
labor
of
another

not
breed
yet
remains
undiminished
its
profits
are
but
its
taxing
power
men
seek
to
become
independent
in
order
to
cease
to
pay
labor
in
order
to
become
masters
without
the
cares
duties
and
responsibilities
of
masters
capital
exercises
a
more
perfect
compulsion
over
free
laborers
than
human
masters
over
slaves
for
free
laborers
must
at
all
times
work
or
starve
and
slaves
are
supported
whether
they
work
or
not
free
laborers
have
less
liberty
than
slaves
are
worse
paid
and
provided
for
and
have
no
valuable
rights
slaves
with
more
of
actual
practical
liberty
with
ampler
allowance
and
constant
protection
are
secure
in
the
enjoyment
of
all
the
rights
which
provide
for
their
physical
comfort
at
all
times
and
under
all
circumstances
the
free
laborer
must
be
employed
or
starve
yet
no
one
is
obliged
to
employ
him
the
slave
is
taken
care
of
whether
employed
or
not
though
each
free
laborer
has
no
particular
master
his
wants
and
other
men
capital
make
him
a
slave
without
a
master
or
with
too
many
masters
which
is
as
bad
as
none
it
were
often
better
that
he
had
an
ascertained
master
instead
of
an
irresponsible
and
unascertained
one
there
are
some
startling
social
phenomena
connected
with
this
subject
of
labor
and
capital
which
will
probably
be
new
to
most
of
our
readers
legislators
and
philosophers
often
puzzle
their
own
and
other
brains
in
vain
discussions
as
to
how
the
taxes
shall
be
laid
so
as
to
fall
on
the
rich
rather
than
the
poor
it
results
from
our
theory
that
as
labor
creates
all
values
laborers
pay
all
taxes
and
the
rich
in
the
words
of
gerrit
smith
are
but
the
conduits
that
pass
them
over
to
government
again
since
labor
alone
creates
and
pays
the
profits
of
capital
increase
and
accumulation
of
capital
but
increase
the
labor
of
the
poor
and
lessen
their
remuneration
thus
the
poor
are
continually
forging
new
chains
for
themselves
proudhon
cites
a
familiar
instance
to
prove
and
illustrate
this
theory
a
tenant
improves
a
farm
or
house
and
enhances
their
rents
his
labor
thus
becomes
the
means
of
increasing
the
tax
which
he
or
some
one
else
must
pay
to
the
capitalist
what
is
true
in
this
instance
is
true
of
the
aggregate
capital
of
the
world
its
increase
is
but
an
increased
tax
on
labor
by
trade
or
speculation
gets
hold
of
an
additional
million
of
dollars
to
the
capital
already
in
existence
now
his
million
of
dollars
will
yield
no
profit
unless
a
number
of
pauper
laborers
sufficient
to
pay
its
profits
are
at
the
same
time
brought
into
existence
after
supporting
their
families
it
will
require
a
thousand
of
laborers
to
pay
the
interest
or
profits
of
a
million
of
dollars
it
may
therefore
be
generally
assumed
as
true
that
where
a
country
has
gained
a
millionaire
it
has
by
the
same
process
gained
a
thousand
pauper
laborers
provided
it
has
been
made
by
profits
on
foreign
trade
or
by
new
values
created
at
home
that
is
if
it
be
an
of
a
million
to
the
capital
of
the
nation
a
nation
borrows
a
hundred
millions
at
six
per
for
a
hundred
years
during
that
time
it
pays
in
way
of
tax
called
interest
six
times
the
capital
loaned
and
then
returns
the
capital
itself
during
all
this
time
to
the
amount
of
the
interest
the
people
of
this
nation
have
been
slaves
to
the
lender
he
has
commanded
not
paid
for
their
labor
for
his
capital
is
returned
intact
in
the
abstract
and
according
to
equity
the
use
of
an
article
is
only
a
proper
subject
of
charge
when
the
article
is
consumed
in
the
use
for
this
consumption
is
the
consumption
of
the
labor
of
the
lender
or
hirer
and
is
the
exchange
of
equal
amounts
of
labor
for
each
other
as
a
merchant
a
lawyer
or
doctor
makes
twenty
dollars
a
day
that
is
exchanges
each
day
of
his
own
labor
for
twenty
days
of
the
labor
of
common
working
men
assuming
that
they
work
at
a
dollar
a
day
in
twenty
years
he
amasses
fifty
thousand
dollars
invests
it
and
settles
it
on
his
family
without
any
labor
he
and
his
heirs
retaining
all
this
capital
continue
by
its
means
to
levy
a
tax
of
three
thousand
dollars
from
common
laborers
he
and
his
heirs
now
pay
nothing
for
labor
but
command
it
they
have
nothing
to
pay
except
their
capital
and
that
they
retain
this
is
the
exploitation
or
despotism
of
capital
which
has
taken
the
place
of
domestic
slavery
and
is
in
fact
a
much
worse
kind
of
slavery
hence
arises
socialism
which
proposes
to
reconstruct
society
now
this
capitalist
is
considered
highly
meritorious
for
so
doing
and
the
poor
laborers
who
really
created
his
capital
and
who
pay
its
profits
are
thought
contemptible
if
not
criminal
in
the
general
those
men
are
considered
the
most
meritorious
who
live
in
greatest
splendor
with
the
least
or
with
no
labor
and
they
most
contemptible
who
labor
most
for
others
and
least
for
themselves
in
the
abstract
however
that
dealing
appears
most
correct
where
men
exchange
equal
amounts
of
labor
bear
equal
burdens
for
others
with
those
that
they
impose
on
them
such
is
the
golden
rule
of
scripture
but
not
the
approved
practice
of
mankind
the
worth
of
a
thing
is
just
what
it
will
bring
is
the
common
trading
principle
of
mankind
yet
men
revolt
at
the
extreme
applications
of
their
own
principle
and
denunciate
any
gross
and
palpable
advantage
taken
of
the
wants
position
and
necessities
of
others
as
but
we
should
recollect
that
in
all
instances
where
unequal
amounts
of
labor
are
exchanged
at
par
advantage
is
really
taken
by
him
who
gets
in
exchange
the
larger
amount
of
labor
of
the
wants
position
and
necessities
of
him
who
receives
the
smaller
amount
we
have
said
that
laborers
pay
all
taxes
but
labor
being
capital
in
slave
society
the
laborers
or
slaves
are
not
injured
by
increased
taxes
and
the
capitalist
or
master
has
to
retrench
his
own
expenses
to
meet
the
additional
tax
capital
is
not
taxed
in
free
society
but
in
slave
society
because
in
such
society
labor
is
capital
the
capitalists
and
the
professional
can
and
do
by
increased
profits
and
fees
throw
the
whole
burden
of
taxation
on
the
laboring
class
slaveholders
can
not
do
so
for
diminished
allowance
to
their
slaves
would
impair
their
value
and
lessen
their
own
capital
our
expose
of
what
the
socialists
term
the
exploitation
of
skill
and
capital
will
not
we
know
be
satisfactory
to
slaveholders
even
for
although
there
be
much
less
of
such
exploitation
or
unjust
exaction
in
slave
society
still
too
much
of
it
remains
to
be
agreeable
to
contemplate
besides
our
analysis
of
human
nature
and
human
pursuits
is
too
dark
and
sombre
to
meet
with
ready
acceptance
we
should
be
rejoiced
to
see
our
theory
refuted
we
are
sure
however
that
it
never
can
be
but
equally
sure
that
it
is
subject
to
many
modifications
and
limitations
that
have
not
occurred
to
us
we
have
this
consolation
that
in
rejecting
as
false
and
noxious
all
systems
of
moral
philosophy
we
are
thrown
upon
the
bible
as
containing
the
only
true
system
of
morals
we
have
attempted
already
to
adduce
three
instances
in
which
the
justification
of
slavery
furnished
new
and
additional
evidence
of
the
truth
of
christianity
we
will
now
add
others
it
is
notorious
that
infidelity
appeared
in
the
world
on
an
extensive
scale
only
cotemporaneously
with
the
abolition
of
slavery
and
that
it
is
now
limited
to
countries
where
no
domestic
slavery
exists
besides
abolitionists
are
commonly
infidels
as
their
speeches
conventions
and
papers
daily
evince
where
there
is
no
slavery
the
minds
of
men
are
unsettled
on
all
subjects
and
there
is
emphatically
faith
and
conviction
about
nothing
their
moral
and
social
world
is
in
a
chaotic
and
anarchical
state
order
subordination
and
adaptation
have
vanished
and
with
them
the
belief
in
a
deity
the
author
of
all
order
it
had
often
been
urged
that
the
order
observable
in
the
moral
and
physical
world
furnished
strong
evidence
of
a
deity
the
author
of
that
order
how
vastly
is
this
argument
now
strengthened
by
the
new
fact
now
first
developed
that
the
destruction
of
social
order
generates
universal
scepticism
mere
political
revolutions
affect
social
order
but
little
and
generate
but
little
infidelity
it
remained
for
social
revolutions
like
those
in
europe
in
to
bring
on
an
infidel
age
for
outside
of
slave
society
such
is
the
age
in
which
we
live
if
we
prove
that
domestic
slavery
is
in
the
general
a
natural
and
necessary
institution
we
remove
the
greatest
stumbling
block
to
belief
in
the
bible
for
whilst
texts
detached
and
torn
from
their
context
may
be
found
for
any
other
purpose
none
can
be
found
that
even
militates
against
slavery
the
distorted
and
forced
construction
of
certain
passages
for
this
purpose
by
abolitionists
if
employed
as
a
common
rule
of
construction
would
reduce
the
bible
to
a
mere
allegory
to
be
interpreted
to
suit
every
vicious
taste
and
wicked
purpose
but
we
have
been
looking
merely
to
one
side
of
human
nature
and
to
that
side
rendered
darker
by
the
false
antagonistic
and
competitive
relations
in
which
liberty
and
equality
place
man
man
is
by
nature
the
most
social
and
gregarious
and
therefore
the
least
selfish
of
animals
within
the
family
there
is
little
room
opportunity
or
temptation
to
selfishness
and
slavery
leaves
but
little
of
the
world
without
the
family
man
loves
that
nearest
to
him
best
first
his
wife
children
and
parents
then
his
slaves
next
his
neighbors
and
but
his
unselfishness
does
not
stop
here
he
is
ready
and
anxious
to
relieve
a
famine
in
ireland
and
shudders
when
he
reads
of
a
murder
at
the
antipodes
he
feels
deeply
for
the
sufferings
of
domestic
animals
and
is
rendered
happy
by
witnessing
the
enjoyments
of
the
flocks
and
herds
and
carroling
birds
that
surround
him
he
sympathizes
with
all
external
nature
a
parched
field
distresses
him
and
he
rejoices
as
he
sees
the
groves
and
the
gardens
and
the
plains
flourishing
and
blooming
and
smiling
about
him
all
men
are
philanthropists
and
would
benefit
their
if
they
could
but
we
can
not
be
sure
of
benefiting
those
whom
we
can
not
control
hence
all
actively
good
men
are
ambitious
and
would
be
masters
in
all
save
the
name
benevolence
the
love
of
what
is
without
and
the
disposition
to
incur
pain
or
inconvenience
to
advance
the
happiness
and
of
what
is
without
self
is
as
universal
a
motive
of
human
conduct
as
mere
selfishness
which
is
the
disposition
to
sacrifice
the
good
of
others
to
our
own
good
the
prevalent
philosophy
of
the
day
takes
cognizance
of
but
half
of
human
nature
and
that
the
worst
half
our
happiness
is
so
involved
in
the
happiness
and
of
everything
around
us
that
a
mere
selfish
philosophy
like
political
economy
is
a
very
unsafe
and
delusive
guide
we
employ
the
term
benevolence
to
express
our
outward
affections
sympathies
tastes
and
feelings
but
it
is
inadequate
to
express
our
meaning
it
is
not
the
opposite
of
selfishness
and
unselfishness
would
be
too
negative
for
our
purpose
philosophy
has
been
so
busy
with
the
worst
feature
of
human
nature
that
it
has
not
even
found
a
name
for
this
its
better
feature
we
must
fall
back
on
christianity
which
embraces
man
whole
nature
and
though
not
a
code
of
philosophy
is
something
better
for
it
proposes
to
lead
us
through
the
trials
and
intricacies
of
life
not
by
the
mere
cool
calculations
of
the
head
but
by
the
unerring
instincts
of
a
pure
and
regenerate
heart
the
problem
of
the
moral
world
is
too
vast
and
complex
for
the
human
mind
to
comprehend
yet
the
pure
heart
will
safely
and
quietly
feel
its
way
through
the
mazes
that
confound

continued
exploitation
of
skill
the
worth
of
a
thing
is
just
what
it
bring
the
professional
man
who
charges
the
highest
fees
is
most
respected
and
he
who
undercharges
stands
disgraced
we
have
a
friend
who
has
been
and
we
believe
will
continue
to
be
one
of
the
most
useful
men
in
virginia
he
inherited
an
independent
patrimony
he
acquired
a
fine
education
and
betook
himself
laboriously
to
an
honorable
profession
his
success
was
great
and
his
charges
very
high
in
a
few
years
he
amassed
a
fortune
and
ceased
work
we
expounded
our
theory
to
him
told
him
we
used
to
consider
him
a
good
man
and
quite
an
example
for
the
rising
generation
but
that
now
he
stood
condemned
under
our
theory
whilst
making
his
fortune
he
daily
exchanged
about
one
day
of
his
light
labor
for
thirty
days
of
the
farmer
the
gardener
the
miner
the
ditcher
the
sewing
woman
and
other
common
working
people
labor
his
capital
was
but
the
accumulation
of
the
results
of
their
labor
for
common
labor
creates
all
capital
their
labor
was
more
necessary
and
useful
than
his
and
also
more
honorable
and
respectable
the
more
honorable
because
they
were
contented
with
their
situation
and
their
profits
and
not
seeking
to
exploitate
by
exchanging
one
day
of
their
labor
for
many
of
other
people
to
be
exploitated
ought
to
be
more
creditable
than
to
exploitate
they
were
slaves
without
masters
the
little
fish
who
were
food
for
all
the
larger
they
stood
disgraced
because
they
would
not
practice
cannibalism
rise
in
the
world
by
more
lucrative
less
useful
and
less
laborious
pursuits
and
live
by
exploitation
rather
than
labor
he
by
practising
cannibalism
more
successfully
than
others
had
acquired
fame
and
fortune
was
the
old
tune
saul
has
slain
his
thousands
and
david
his
tens
of
thousands
the
more
scalps
we
can
shew
the
more
honored
we
are
we
told
him
he
had
made
his
fortune
by
the
exploitation
of
skill
and
was
now
living
by
the
still
worse
exploitation
of
capital
whilst
working
he
made
thirty
dollars
a
day
that
is
exploitated
or
appropriated
the
labor
of
thirty
common
working
men
and
gave
in
exchange
his
own
labor
intrinsically
less
worthy
than
any
one
of
theirs
but
now
he
was
doing
worse
he
was
using
his
capital
as
a
power
to
compel
others
to
work
for
him
for
whom
he
did
not
work
at
all
the
white
laborers
who
made
his
income
or
interests
and
dividends
were
wholly
neglected
by
him
because
he
did
not
know
even
who
they
were
he
treated
his
negro
slaves
much
better
it
was
true
he
appropriated
or
exploitated
much
of
the
results
of
their
labor
but
he
governed
them
and
provided
for
them
with
almost
parental
affection
some
of
them
we
knew
who
feigned
to
be
unfit
for
labor
he
was
boarding
expensively
our
friend
at
first
ridiculed
our
theory
but
by
degrees
began
to
see
its
truth
and
being
sensitively
conscientious
was
disposed
to
fret
whenever
the
subject
was
introduced
one
day
he
met
us
with
a
face
beaming
with
smiles
and
said
i
can
explain
and
justify
that
new
theory
of
yours
this
oppression
and
exaction
of
skill
and
capital
which
we
see
continually
practiced
and
which
is
too
natural
to
man
ever
to
cease
is
necessary
in
order
to
disperse
and
diffuse
population
over
the
globe
half
the
good
lands
of
the
world
are
unappropriated
and
invite
settlement
and
cultivation
most
men
who
choose
can
become
proprietors
by
change
of
residence
they
are
too
much
crowded
in
many
countries
and
exploitation
that
disperses
them
is
a
blessing
it
will
be
time
enough
to
discuss
your
theory
of
the
despotism
of
skill
and
capital
when
all
the
world
is
densely
settled
and
the
men
without
property
can
no
longer
escape
from
the
exactions
of
those
who
hold
property
our
friend
theory
is
certainly
ingenious
and
novel
and
goes
far
to
prove
that
exploitation
is
not
an
unmitigated
evil
under
exceptional
circumstances
its
good
effects
on
human
happiness
and
may
greatly
its
evil
influences
such
probably
is
the
case
at
the
north
there
free
competition
and
the
consequent
oppressions
of
skill
and
capital
are
fiercer
and
more
active
than
in
any
other
country
but
in
hours
laborers
may
escape
to
the
west
and
become
proprietors
it
is
a
blessing
to
them
to
be
thus
expelled
and
a
blessing
to
those
who
expel
them
the
emigration
to
the
west
rids
the
east
of
a
surplus
population
and
enriches
it
by
the
interchanges
of
trade
and
commerce
which
the
emigration
immediately
begets
as
an
exceptional
form
of
society
we
begin
to
think
that
at
the
north
highly
useful
it
will
continue
to
be
good
and
useful
until
the
is
peopled
then
and
not
till
then
it
will
be
time
for
greely
to
build
phalansteries
and
for
gerrit
smith
to
divide
all
the
lands
we
find
that
we
shall
have
to
defend
the
north
as
well
as
the
south
against
the
assaults
of
the
abolitionist
still
we
can
not
abate
a
jot
or
tittle
of
our
theory
slavery
is
the
natural
and
normal
condition
of
society
the
situation
of
the
north
is
abnormal
and
anomalous
so
in
desert
or
mountainous
regions
where
only
small
patches
of
land
can
be
cultivated
the
father
wife
and
children
are
sufficient
for
the
purpose
and
slavery
would
be
superfluous
in
order
to
make
sure
that
our
reader
shall
comprehend
our
theory
we
will
give
a
long
extract
from
the
science
of
society
by
stephen
pearle
andrews
of
new
york
he
is
we
think
far
the
ablest
writer
on
moral
science
that
america
has
produced
though
an
abolitionist
he
has
not
a
very
bad
opinion
of
slavery
we
verily
believe
there
is
not
one
intelligent
abolitionist
at
the
north
who
does
not
believe
that
slavery
to
capital
in
free
society
is
worse
than
southern
negro
slavery
but
like
andrews
they
are
all
perfectionists
with
a
utopia
in
full
view
i
suppose
i
am
a
wheelwright
in
a
small
village
and
the
only
one
of
my
trade
you
are
travelling
with
certain
valuables
in
your
carriage
which
breaks
down
opposite
my
shop
it
will
take
an
hour
of
my
time
to
mend
the
carriage
you
can
get
no
other
means
of
conveyance
and
the
loss
to
you
if
you
fail
to
arrive
at
the
neighboring
town
in
season
for
the
sailing
of
a
certain
vessel
will
be
which
fact
you
mention
to
me
in
good
faith
in
order
to
quicken
my
exertions
i
give
one
hour
of
my
work
and
mend
the
carriage
what
am
i
in
equity
entitled
to
charge
what
should
be
the
of
upon
my
labor
let
us
apply
the
different
measures
and
see
how
they
will
operate
if
value
is
the
limit
of
price
then
the
price
of
the
hour
labor
should
be
that
is
the
equivalent
of
the
value
of
the
labor
to
you
if
cost
is
the
limit
of
price
then
you
should
pay
me
a
commodity
or
commodities
or
a
representative
in
currency
which
will
procure
me
commodities
having
in
them
one
hour
labor
equally
as
hard
as
the
mending
of
the
carriage
without
the
slightest
reference
to
the
degree
of
benefit
which
that
labor
has
bestowed
on
you
or
putting
the
illustration
in
money
thus
assuming
the
cents
to
be
an
equivalent
for
an
hour
labor
of
an
artizan
in
that
particular
trade
then
according
to
the
i
should
be
justified
in
asking
only
cents
but
according
to
the
i
should
be
justified
in
asking
the
in
some
form
of
expression
is
as
i
have
said
the
only
principle
of
trade
throughout
the
world
a
thing
is
worth
what
it
will
bring
in
the
market
still
if
i
were
to
charge
you
or
a
fourth
part
of
that
sum
and
taking
advantage
of
your
necessities
force
you
to
pay
it
everybody
would
denounce
me
the
poor
wheelwright
as
an
extortioner
and
a
scoundrel
why
simply
because
this
is
an
application
of
the
principle
wheelwrights
seldom
have
a
chance
to
make
such
a
speculation
and
therefore
it
is
not
according
to
the
established
usages
of
trade
hence
its
manifest
injustice
shocks
in
such
a
case
the
common
sense
of
right
meanwhile
you
a
wealthy
merchant
are
daily
rolling
up
an
immense
fortune
by
doing
business
upon
the
same
principle
which
you
condemn
in
the
wheelwright
and
nobody
finds
fault
at
every
scarcity
in
the
market
you
immediately
raise
the
price
of
every
article
you
hold
it
is
your
to
take
advantage
of
the
necessities
of
those
with
whom
you
deal
by
selling
to
them
according
to
the
to
them
and
not
according
to
the
to
you
you
go
further
you
by
every
means
in
your
power
create
those
necessities
by
buying
up
particular
articles
and
holding
them
out
of
the
market
until
the
demand
becomes
pressing
by
circulating
false
reports
of
short
crops
and
by
other
similar
tricks
known
to
the
trade
this
is
the
same
in
principle
as
if
the
wheelwright
had
first
dug
the
rut
in
which
your
carriage
upset
and
then
charged
you
the
yet
hitherto
no
one
has
thought
of
seriously
questioning
the
principle
namely
that
is
the
limit
of
or
in
other
words
that
is
right
to
take
for
a
thing
what
it
is
it
is
upon
this
principle
or
maxim
that
all
trade
professes
now
to
be
conducted
until
instances
arise
in
which
its
oppressive
operation
is
so
glaring
and
repugnant
to
the
moral
sense
of
mankind
that
those
who
carry
it
out
are
denounced
as
rogues
and
cheats
in
this
manner
a
sort
of
conventional
limit
is
placed
upon
the
application
of
a
principle
which
is
equally
of
every
swindling
transaction
and
of
what
is
called
legitimate
commerce
the
discovery
has
not
hitherto
been
made
that
the
principle
itself
is
essentially
vicious
and
that
in
its
infinite
and
variety
of
applications
this
vicious
principle
is
of
the
injustice
inequality
of
condition
and
frightful
pauperism
and
wretchedness
which
characterize
the
existing
state
of
our
civilization
still
less
has
the
discovery
been
made
that
there
is
another
simple
principle
of
traffic
which
once
understood
and
applied
in
practice
will
effectually
rectify
all
those
monstrous
evils
and
introduce
into
human
society
the
reign
of
absolute
equity
in
all
property
relations
while
it
will
lay
the
foundations
of
universal
harmony
in
the
social
and
moral
relations
as
well
ii
suppose
it
costs
me
ten
minutes
labor
to
concoct
a
pill
which
will
save
your
life
when
nothing
else
will
and
suppose
at
the
same
time
to
render
the
case
simple
that
the
knowledge
of
the
ingredients
came
to
me
by
accident
without
labor
or
it
is
clear
that
your
life
is
worth
to
you
more
than
your
fortune
am
i
then
entitled
to
demand
of
you
for
the
nostrum
the
whole
of
your
property
more
or
less
clearly
so
if
is
right
to
take
for
a
thing
what
it
is
which
is
theoretically
the
highest
ethics
of
trade
forced
on
the
one
hand
by
the
impossibility
existing
in
the
nature
of
things
of
ascertaining
and
measuring
positive
values
or
of
determining
in
other
words
what
a
thing
really
and
rendered
partially
conscious
by
the
obvious
hardship
and
injustice
of
every
unusual
or
extreme
application
of
the
principle
that
it
is
either
no
rule
or
a
bad
one
and
not
guided
by
the
knowledge
of
any
true
principle
out
of
the
labyrinth
of
conflicting
rights
into
which
the
false
principle
conducts
the
world
has
practically
abandoned
the
attempt
to
combine
equity
with
commerce
and
lowered
its
standard
of
morality
to
the
inverse
statement
of
the
formula
namely
that
thing
is
worth
what
it
will
or
in
other
words
that
it
is
fitting
and
proper
to
take
for
a
thing
when
sold
whatever
can
be
got
for
it
this
then
is
what
is
denominated
the
market
value
of
an
article
as
distinguished
from
its
actual
value
without
being
more
equitable
as
a
measure
of
price
it
certainly
has
a
great
practical
advantage
over
the
more
decent
theoretical
statement
in
the
fact
that
it
possible
to
ascertain
by
experiment
how
much
you
can
force
people
through
their
necessities
to
give
the
principle
in
this
form
measures
the
price
by
the
degree
of
on
the
part
of
the
purchaser
that
is
by
what
he
supposes
will
prove
to
be
the
value
or
benefit
to
him
of
the
commodity
purchased
in
comparison
with
that
of
the
one
with
which
he
parts
in
the
transaction
hence
it
becomes
immediately
and
continually
the
interest
of
the
seller
to
place
the
purchaser
in
a
condition
of
as
much
want
as
possible
to
corner
him
as
the
phrase
is
in
wall
street
and
force
him
to
buy
at
the
dearest
rate
if
he
is
unable
to
increase
his
actual
necessity
he
resorts
to
every
means
of
creating
an
imaginary
want
by
false
praises
bestowed
upon
the
qualities
and
uses
of
his
goods
hence
the
usages
of
forestalling
the
market
of
confusing
the
public
knowledge
of
supply
and
demand
of
advertising
and
puffing
worthless
commodities
and
the
like
which
constitute
the
existing
commercial
system
a
system
which
in
our
age
is
ripening
into
putrefaction
and
coming
to
offend
the
nostrils
of
good
taste
no
less
than
the
innate
sense
of
right
which
dreadfully
vitiating
as
it
is
it
has
failed
wholly
to
extinguish
the
value
principle
in
this
form
as
in
the
other
is
therefore
without
being
distinctly
understood
to
be
essentially
diabolical
and
hence
it
undergoes
again
a
kind
of
sentimental
modification
wherever
the
for
honesty
is
most
potent
this
last
and
highest
expression
of
the
doctrine
of
honesty
as
now
known
in
the
world
may
be
stated
in
the
form
of
the
hortatory
precept
do
be
bad
or
gouge
deep
no
political
economist
financier
moralist
or
religionist
has
any
more
definite
standard
of
right
in
commercial
transactions
than
that
it
is
not
too
much
to
affirm
that
neither
political
economist
financier
moralist
nor
religionist
knows
at
this
day
nor
ever
has
known
what
it
is
to
be
honest
the
religious
teacher
who
exhorts
his
hearers
from
sabbath
to
sabbath
to
be
in
their
dealings
with
each
other
and
with
the
outside
world
does
not
know
and
could
not
for
his
life
tell
how
much
he
is
in
fair
dealing
or
equity
bound
to
pay
his
washerwoman
or
his
housekeeper
for
any
service
whatever
which
they
may
render
the
of
honesty
exists
but
the
of
honesty
is
wanting
the
sentiment
is
first
in
order
the
science
must
be
an
outgrowth
a
consequential
development
of
the
sentiment
the
precepts
of
christian
morality
deal
properly
with
that
which
is
the
soul
of
the
other
leaving
to
intellectual
investigation
the
discovery
of
its
scientific
complement
it
follows
from
what
has
been
said
that
the
value
principle
is
the
commercial
embodiment
of
the
essential
element
of
conquest
and
war
war
transferred
from
the
to
the
counter
none
the
less
opposed
however
to
the
spirit
of
christian
morality
or
the
sentiment
of
human
brotherhood
in
bodily
conflict
the
physically
strong
conquer
and
subject
the
physically
weak
in
the
conflict
of
trade
the
intellectually
astute
and
powerful
conquer
and
subject
those
who
are
intellectually
feeble
or
whose
intellectual
development
is
not
of
the
precise
kind
to
fit
them
for
the
conflict
of
wits
in
the
matter
of
trade
with
the
progress
of
civilization
and
development
we
have
ceased
to
think
that
superior
physical
strength
gives
the
of
conquest
and
subjugation
we
have
graduated
in
idea
out
of
the
period
of
physical
dominion
we
remain
however
as
yet
in
the
period
of
intellectual
conquest
or
plunder
it
has
not
been
questioned
hitherto
as
a
general
proposition
that
the
man
who
has
superior
intellectual
endowments
to
others
has
a
right
resulting
therefrom
to
profit
thereby
at
the
cost
of
others
in
the
extreme
applications
of
the
admission
only
is
the
conclusion
ever
denied
in
the
whole
field
of
what
are
denominated
the
legitimate
operations
of
trade
there
is
no
other
law
recognized
than
the
relative
smartness
or
shrewdness
of
the
parties
modified
at
most
by
the
sentimental
precept
stated
above
the
intrinsic
wrongfulness
of
the
principal
axioms
and
practice
of
existing
commerce
will
appear
to
every
reflecting
mind
from
the
preceding
analysis
it
will
be
proper
however
before
dismissing
the
consideration
of
the
value
principle
to
trace
out
a
little
more
in
detail
some
of
its
specific
results
the
principle
itself
being
essentially
iniquitous
all
the
fruits
of
the
principle
are
necessarily
pernicious
among
the
consequences
which
flow
from
it
are
the
following
i
renders
falsehood
and
hypocrisy
a
necessary
concomitant
of
where
the
object
is
to
buy
cheap
and
sell
dear
the
parties
find
their
interest
in
mutual
deception
it
is
taught
in
theory
that
honesty
is
the
best
policy
in
the
long
run
but
in
practice
the
merchant
discovers
speedily
that
he
must
starve
if
he
acts
upon
the
precept
in
the
short
run
honesty
even
as
much
honesty
as
can
be
arrived
at
is
the
best
policy
under
the
present
unscientific
system
of
commerce
if
by
the
best
policy
is
meant
that
which
tends
to
success
in
business
professional
merchants
are
sharp
to
distinguish
their
true
policy
for
that
end
and
they
do
not
find
it
in
a
full
exposition
of
the
truth
intelligent
merchants
know
the
fact
well
and
conscientious
merchants
deplore
it
but
they
see
no
remedy
the
theory
of
trade
taught
to
innocent
youths
in
the
retired
family
or
the
sunday
school
would
ruin
any
clerk
if
adhered
to
behind
the
counter
in
a
fortnight
hence
it
is
uniformly
abandoned
and
a
new
system
of
morality
acquired
the
moment
a
practical
application
is
to
be
made
of
the
instruction
a
frank
disclosure
by
the
merchant
of
all
the
secret
advantages
in
his
possession
would
destroy
his
reputation
for
sagacity
as
effectually
as
it
would
that
of
the
gambler
among
his
associates
both
commerce
and
gambling
as
professions
are
systems
of
strategy
it
is
the
business
of
both
parties
to
a
trade
to
each
other
a
fact
which
finds
its
unblushing
announcement
in
the
maxim
of
the
common
law
let
the
purchaser
take
care
ii
makes
the
rich
richer
and
the
poor
trade
being
under
this
system
the
intellectual
correspondence
to
the
occupation
of
the
or
conqueror
under
the
reign
of
physical
force
the
stronger
consequently
accumulating
more
than
his
share
at
the
cost
of
the
destruction
of
the
weaker
the
consequence
of
the
principle
is
that
the
occupation
of
trade
for
those
who
possess
intellectual
superiority
with
other
favorable
conditions
enables
them
to
accumulate
more
than
their
share
of
wealth
while
it
reduces
those
whose
intellectual
development
of
the
precise
kind
requisite
for
this
species
of
contest
and
whose
material
conditions
are
less
favorable
to
wretchedness
and
poverty
iii
creates
trade
for
trade
sake
and
augments
the
number
of
whose
support
is
chargeable
upon
as
trade
under
the
operation
of
this
principle
offers
the
temptation
of
illicit
gains
and
rapid
wealth
at
the
expense
of
others
it
creates
trade
where
there
is
no
necessity
for
trade
not
as
a
beneficent
interchange
of
commodities
between
producers
and
consumers
but
as
a
means
of
speculation
hence
thousands
are
withdrawn
from
actual
production
and
thrust
unnecessarily
into
the
business
of
exchanging
mutually
devouring
each
other
by
competition
and
drawing
their
subsistence
and
their
wealth
from
the
producing
classes
without
rendering
any
equivalent
service
hence
the
interminable
range
of
intermediates
between
the
producer
and
consumer
the
total
defeat
of
organization
and
economy
in
the
distribution
of
products
and
the
intolerable
burden
of
the
unproductive
classes
upon
labor
together
with
a
host
of
the
frightful
results
of
pauperism
and
crime
iv
degrades
the
dignity
of
inasmuch
as
trade
under
the
operation
of
this
principle
is
more
profitable
or
at
any
rate
is
liable
to
be
promises
to
be
and
in
a
portion
of
cases
is
more
profitable
than
productive
labor
it
follows
that
the
road
to
wealth
and
social
distinction
lies
in
that
direction
hence
commerce
is
king
hence
again
productive
labor
is
depreciated
and
contemned
it
holds
the
same
relation
to
commerce
in
this
age
under
the
reign
of
intellectual
superioritythat
commerce
itself
held
a
few
generations
since
under
the
reign
of
physical
force
to
military
achievement
personal
or
hereditary
thus
the
degradation
of
labor
and
all
the
innumerable
evils
which
follow
in
its
train
in
our
existing
civilization
find
their
efficient
cause
in
this
same
false
principle
of
exchanging
products
the
next
stage
of
progress
will
be
the
inauguration
of
equity
equality
in
the
results
of
every
species
of
industry
according
to
burdens
and
the
consequent
accession
of
labor
to
the
highest
rank
of
human
estimation
commerce
will
then
sink
to
a
mere
brokerage
paid
like
any
other
species
of
labor
according
to
its
repugnance
as
the
army
is
now
sinking
to
a
mere
police
force
it
will
be
reduced
to
the
simplest
and
most
direct
methods
of
exchange
and
made
to
be
the
merest
servant
of
production
which
will
come
in
its
turn
to
be
regarded
as
conferring
the
only
true
patents
of
nobility
prevents
the
possibility
of
a
scientific
adjustment
of
supply
to
it
has
been
already
shown
that
speculation
is
the
cause
why
there
has
never
been
and
can
not
now
be
any
scientific
adaptation
of
supply
to
demand
it
has
also
been
partially
shown
at
various
points
that
speculation
or
trading
in
chances
and
fluctuations
in
the
market
has
its
root
in
the
value
principle
and
that
the
cost
principle
extinguishes
speculation
it
will
be
proper
however
in
this
connection
to
define
exactly
the
limits
of
speculation
and
to
point
out
more
specifically
how
the
value
principle
creates
it
and
how
the
cost
principle
extinguishes
it
by
speculation
is
meant
in
the
ordinary
language
of
trade
risky
and
unusual
enterprises
entered
upon
for
the
sake
of
more
than
ordinary
profits
and
in
that
sense
there
is
attached
to
it
among
merchants
a
slight
shade
of
imputation
of
dishonesty
or
disreputable
conduct
as
we
are
seeking
now
however
to
employ
language
in
an
exact
and
scientific
way
we
must
find
a
more
precise
definition
of
the
term
the
line
between
ordinary
and
more
than
ordinary
profits
is
too
vague
for
a
scientific
treatise
at
one
extremity
of
the
long
succession
of
and
transactions
stands
gambling
which
is
denounced
by
the
common
verdict
of
mankind
as
merely
a
more
specious
form
of
robbery
it
holds
the
same
relation
to
robbery
itself
that
duelling
holds
to
murder
where
is
the
other
end
of
this
succession
at
what
point
does
a
man
begin
to
take
an
undue
advantage
of
his
fellow
man
in
a
commercial
transaction
it
clearly
appears
from
all
that
has
been
shown
that
he
does
so
from
the
moment
that
he
receives
from
him
more
than
an
exact
equivalent
of
cost
but
it
is
the
constant
endeavor
of
every
trader
upon
any
other
than
the
cost
principle
to
do
that
the
business
of
the
merchant
is
signifies
etymologically
made
over
and
that
is
something
beyond
an
or
in
its
simplest
expression
for
it
is
clear
then
that
there
is
no
difference
between
in
its
mildest
form
speculation
in
its
opprobrious
sense
as
the
middle
term
and
gambling
as
the
ultimate
except
in
degree
there
is
simply
the
bad
gradation
of
rank
which
there
is
between
the
slaveholder
the
driver
on
the
slave
plantation
and
the
slave
dealer
or
between
the
man
of
pleasure
the
harlot
and
the
pimp
the
philanthropy
of
the
age
is
moving
heaven
and
earth
to
the
overthrow
of
the
institution
of
slavery
but
slavery
has
no
scientific
definition
it
is
thought
to
consist
in
the
feature
of
chattelism
but
an
ingenious
lawyer
would
run
his
pen
through
every
statute
upon
slavery
in
existence
and
expunge
that
fiction
of
the
law
and
yet
leave
slavery
for
all
practical
purposes
precisely
what
it
is
now
it
needs
only
to
appropriate
the
services
of
the
man
by
operation
of
law
instead
of
the
man
himself
the
only
distinction
then
left
between
his
condition
and
that
of
the
laborer
who
is
robbed
by
the
operation
of
a
false
commercial
principle
would
be
in
the
fact
of
the
oppression
being
more
tangible
and
undisguisedly
degrading
to
his
manhood
if
in
any
transaction
i
get
from
you
some
portion
of
your
earnings
without
an
equivalent
i
begin
to
make
you
my
slave
to
confiscate
you
to
my
uses
if
i
get
a
larger
portion
of
your
services
without
an
equivalent
i
make
you
still
further
my
slave
and
finally
if
i
obtain
the
whole
of
your
services
without
an
equivalent
except
the
means
of
keeping
you
in
working
condition
for
my
own
sake
i
make
you
completely
my
slave
slavery
is
merely
one
development
of
a
general
system
of
human
oppression
for
which
we
have
no
comprehensive
term
in
english
but
which
the
french
socialists
denominate
the
abstraction
directly
or
indirectly
from
the
working
classes
of
the
fruits
of
their
labor
in
the
case
of
the
slave
the
instrument
of
that
abstraction
is
force
and
legal
enactments
in
the
case
of
the
laborer
generally
it
is
speculation
in
the
large
sense
or
the
slaveholder
will
be
found
therefore
upon
a
scientific
analysis
to
hold
the
same
relation
to
the
trader
which
the
freebooter
holds
to
the
blackleg
it
is
a
question
of
taste
which
to
admire
most
the
boldness
of
the

or
the
oily
and
intriguing
propensities
and
performances
of

international

as
individuals
possessing

exploitate
or
compel
other
individuals
in
the

community
to
work
for
them
for
nothing
or
for
undue
consideration
precisely
in
the
same
way
do
nations
possessed
of
those
advantages
exploitate
other

with
whom
they

who

england
lends
say
five
hundred
millions
of
dollars
to
governments
and
individuals
in
america
in
a
hundred
years
she
will
have
withdrawn
from
us
in
interest
six
times
the
amount
loaned
or
advanced
and
at
the
expiration
of
that
time
she
withdraws
the
principal
itself
we
pay
england
a
tax
of
at
least
three
thousand
million
of
dollars
in
a
century
for
her
loans
to
us
are
probably
even
larger
than
the
amount
assumed
she
commands
the
results
of
our
labor
to
that
extent
and
gives
us
not
a
cent
of
the
results
of
her

in

for
her

loaned
represents
her
labor
and
that
we
return
to
her
intact
we
are
to
that
extent
her
slaves
slaves
without
masters
for
she
commands
and
enjoys
our
labor
and
is
under
none
of
the
obligations
of
a
master
to
protect
defend
and
provide
for
us
her
superior
skill
in
the
mechanic
arts
by
means
of
free
trade
taxes
or
exploitates
us
quite
as
much
as
her
capital
she
exchanges
her
comparatively
light
and
skillful
labor
for
our
hard
exposed
and
unintellectual
labor
and
in
the
general
compels
us
to
labor
three
hours
for
her
when
she
labors
one
for
us
thus
after
deducting
the
cost
of
the
material
a
yard
of
her
cloth
will
exchange
for
an
amount
of
our
cotton
corn
or
meat
that
cost
three
times
as
much
labor
to
produce
as
her
yard
of

as
in

the
skillful
and
professional
tax
or
exploitate
the
common

by
exchanging
one

of
their
light
labor
for
many
of
the
common

hard
labor
as
lawyers
doctors
merchants
and
mechanics
deal
with

laborers
so
england
and
new
england
treat
us
of
the
south
this
theory
and
this
alone
accounts
for
england
ability
to
pay
the
interest
on
her
national
debt
and
yet
increase
her
wealth
she
effects
it
all
by
the
immense
profits
of
the
exploitation
of
her
skill
and
capital
by
the
power
which
they
give
her
to
command
labor
and
appropriate
its
results
without
consideration
or
for
a
very
partial
consideration
she
trades
with
the
world
and
exploitates
it
all
except
france
france
sets
the
fashion
and
this
enables
her
to
exploitate
england
england
in
her
trade
with
france
has
to
pay
for
french
fashions
as
well
as
french
labor
in
other
words
france
possesses
superior
skill
and
exploitates
england
by
means
of
it
labor
not
skill
is
the
just
and
equitable
measure
of
values
america
sends
her
cotton
her
surplus
grain
and
meats
and
other
agricultural
products
and
her
california
gold
to
england
and
gets
worse
than
nothing
in
return
for
if
she
were
compelled
to
produce
at
home
what
she
procures
from
england
she
must
cultivate
a
thousand
skillful
and
intellectual
pursuits
instead
of
being
as
she
too
much
is
confined
to
the
coarse
drudgery
of
common
labor
the
southern
states
of
this
union
are
exploitated
of
their
labor
and
their
brains
in
their
trade
with
england
and
new
england
they
produce
nothing
which
we
had
not
better
produce
at
home
northern
trade
exploitates
us
trade
further
south
would
enrich
us
and
enlighten
us
for
we
would
manufacture
for
the
far
south
we
should
become
exploitators
instead
of
being
exploitated
when
we
were
in
new
haven
a
distinguished
abolitionist
boasted
to
us
that
mechanics
received
two
dollars
per
day
for
their
labor
and
by
their
china
trade
exchanged
the
products
of
one
day
labor
for
twenty
days
labor
of
the
chinese
who
worked
for
ten
cents
a
day
the
new
england
mechanic
was
thus
the
master
of
twenty
chinese
laborers
whose
labor
he
commanded
for
one
of
his
own
day
labor
here
was
an
instance
of
individual
not
of
national
exploitation
well
might
china
dread
free
trade
it
gives
her
taskmasters
who
impoverish
her
people
and
depress
her
civilization
for
they
by
their
machinery
and
superior
skill
withdraw
her
people
from
a
thousand
mechanical
pursuits
that
promoted
civilization
in
sociology
we
explained
this
subject
synthetically
we
have
tried
now

false
philosophy
of
the
age
the
moral
philosophy
of
our
age
which
term
we
use
generically
to
include
politics
ethics
and
economy
domestic
and
national
is
deduced
from
the
existing
relations
of
men
to
each
other
in
free
society
and
attempts
to
explain
to
justify
to
generalize
and
regulate
those
relations
if
that
system
of
society
be
wrong
and
its
relations
false
the
philosophy
resulting
from
it
must
partake
of
its
error
and
falsity
on
the
other
hand
if
our
current
philosophy
be
true
slavery
must
be
wrong
because
that
philosophy
is
at
war
with
slavery
no
successful
defence
of
slavery
can
be
made
till
we
succeed
in
refuting
or
invalidating
the
principles
on
which
free
society
rests
for
support
or
defence
the
world
however
is
sick
of
its
philosophy
and
the
socialists
have
left
it
not
a
leg
to
stand
on
in
fact
it
is
in
all
its
ramifications
a
mere
expansion
and
application
of
political

and
political
economy
may
be
in
the
phrase
or
let
alone
a
system
of
unmitigated
selfishness
pervades
and
distinguishes
all
departments
of
ethical
political
and
economic
science
the
philosophy
is
partially
true
because
selfishness
as
a
rule
of
action
and
guide
of
conduct
is
necessary
to
the
existence
of
man
and
of
all
other
animals
but
it
should
not
be
with
man
especially
the
only
rule
and
guide
for
he
is
by
nature
eminently
social
and
gregarious
his
wants
his
weakness
his
appetites
his
affections
compel
him
to
look
without
and
beyond
self
in
order
to
sustain
self
the
eagle
and
the
owl
the
lion
and
the
tiger
are
not
gregarious
but
solitary
and
they
practice
political
economy
because
is
adapted
to
their
natures
but
men
and
beavers
herds
bees
and
ants
require
a
different
philosophy
another
guide
of
conduct
the
bible
independent
of
its
authority
is
far
man
best
guide
even
in
this
world
next
to
it
we
would
place
aristotle
but
all
books
written
four
hundred
or
more
years
ago
are
apt
to
yield
useful
instruction
whilst
those
written
since
that
time
will
generally
mislead
we
mean
of
course
books
on
moral
science
we
should
not
be
far
out
in
saying
that
no
book
on
physics
written
more
than
four
hundred
years
ago
is
worth
reading
and
none
on
morals
written
within
that
time
the
reformation
which
effected
much
of
practical
good
gave
birth
to
a
false
philosophy
which
has
been
increasing
and
ramifying
until
our
day
and
now
threatens
the
overthrow
of
all
social
institutions
the
right
of
private
judgment
led
to
the
doctrine
of
human
individuality
and
a
social
contract
to
restrict
that
individuality
hence
also
arose
the
doctrines
of
free
competition
human
equality
freedom
of
religion
of
speech
and
of
the
press
and
universal
liberty
the
right
of
private
judgment
naturally
enough
leads
to
the
right
to
act
on
that
judgment
to
the
supreme
sovereignty
of
the
individual
and
the
abnegation
of
all
government
no
doubt
the
reformation
resulted
from
the
relaxation
of
feudalism
and
the
increased
liberties
of
mind
and
body
which
men
had
begun
to
relish
and
enjoy
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
reformation
as
such
for
reform
was
needed
nor
with
all
of
the
philosophy
that
has
been
deduced
from
it
but
it
is
the
excess
of
reform
and
the
excessive
applications
of
that
philosophy
to
which
we
object
man
is
selfish
as
well
as
social
he
is
born
a
part
and
member
of
society
born
and
lives
a
slave
of
society
but
he
has
also
natural
individual
rights
and
liberties
what
are
his
obligations
to
society
what
his
individual
rights
what
position
he
is
entitled
to
what
duties
he
should
fulfill
depend
upon
a
thousand
circumstances
in
the
wants
and
capacities
of
the
individual
and
in
the
necessities
and
of
the
society
to
which
he
belongs
modern
philosophy
treats
of
men
only
as
separate
monads
or
individuals
it
is
therefore
always
partly
false
and
partly
true
because
whilst
man
is
always
a
limb
or
member
of
the
being
society
he
is
also
a
being
himself
and
does
not
bear
to
society
the
mere
relation
which
the
hand
or
the
foot
does
to
the
human
body
shall
propose
no
new
philosophy
no
universal
and
unerring
principles
or
guide
in
place
of
those
which
we
assail
a
moral
pathology
which
feels
its
way
in
life
and
adapts
itself
to
circumstances
as
they
present
themselves
is
the
nearest
approach
to
philosophy
which
it
is
either
safe
or
wise
to
attempt
all
the
rest
must
be
left
to
religion
to
faith
and
to
providence
this
inadequacy
of
philosophy
has
in
all
ages
and
nations
driven
men
to
lean
on
religious
faith
for
support
though
assailing
all
common
theories
we
are
but
giving
bold
and
candid
expression
to
the
commonest
of
thoughts
the
universal
admiration
of
the
passages
we
are
about
to
cite
proves
the
truth
of
our

that

an

to

and
reduce
the

to
a

an

although
we
can

do
make

as
good

we
despise
ourselves
and
admire
the
french

give
four

of

for

just
to

the

each
had
its

we
shall
have
no

the

till
the

betray

but
for
all
that
it
was
the
best
english
of

its
smack
of
provincialism
gave
it
a
higher
flavor
we
of
the
south
teach

because
it
is
taught
in
europe
yet
political
economy
and
all
other
systems
of
moral
science
which
we
derive
from
europe
are
tainted
with
abolition
and
at
war
with
our
institutions
we
must
build
up
centres
of

of

at

we
must
become
national
nay
provincial

cease

have

the

furnish

which

at
that

ceased

looked
to

where
the

of

borrowed
all

improvement

ceased
and
imitation
chaining
the

soon
induced
rapid
retrogression
thus
we
think

occasioned
the
decline

northern

broke
up
centralization
arrested

nehemiah
adams
has
a
similar
thought
in
his
admirable
work
a
southside
view
of
slavery
which
we
regret
is
not
before
us
on
some
public
occasion
in
charleston
he
was
struck
with
the
good
order
and
absence
of
all
dissipation
and
very
naively
asked
where
was
their
mob
he
was
informed
that
they
were
at
work
he
immediately
perceived
that
slavery
was
an
admirable
police
institution
and
moralizes
very
wisely
on
the
occasion
slavery
is
an
indispensable
police
institution
especially
so
to
check
the
cruelty
and
tyranny
of
vicious
and
depraved
husbands
and
parents
husbands
and
parents
have
in
theory
and
practice
a
power
over
their
subjects
more
despotic
than
kings
and
the
ignorant
and
vicious
exercise
their
power
more
oppressively
than
kings
every
man
is
not
fit
to
be
king
yet
all
must
have
wives
and
children
put
a
master
over
them
to
check
their
power
and
we
need
not
resort
to
the
unnatural
remedies
of
woman
rights
limited
marriages
voluntary
divorces
and
free
love
as
proposed
by
the
abolitionists
carlyle
says
among
practical
men
the
idea
prevails
that
government
can
do
nothing
but
the
peace
they
say
all
higher
tasks
are
unsafe
for
it
impossible
for
it
and
in

not
necessary
for
it
or
for
us
truly
it
is
high
time
that
same
beautiful
notion
of
should
take
itself
away
the
world
is
daily
rushing
towards
wreck
whilst
it
lasts
if
your
government
is
to
be
a
constituted
anarchy
what
issue
can
it
have
our
own
interest
in
such
government
is
that
it
would
be
kind
enough
to
cease
and
go
its
way
before
the
inevitable
wreck
the
reader
will
excuse
us
for
so
often
introducing
the
thoughts
and
words
of
others
we
do
so
not
only
for
the
sake
of
their
authority
but
because
they
express
our
own
thoughts
better
than
we
can
express
them
ourselves
in
truth
we
deal
out
our
thoughts
facts
and
arguments
in
that
irregular
and
desultory
way
in
which
we
acquired
them
we
are
no
regular
built
scholar
have
pursued
no
royal
road
to
mathematics
nor
to
anything
else
we
have
by
observation
and
desultory
reading
picked
up
our
information
by
the
wayside
and
endeavored
to
arrange
generalize
and
digest
it
for
ourselves
to
learn
to
forget
is
almost
the
only
thing
we
have
labored
to
learn
we
have
been
so
bored
through
life
by
friends
with
dyspeptic
memories
who
never
digest
what
they
read
because
they
never
forget
it
who
retain
on
their
intellectual
stomachs
in
gross
crude
undigested
and
unassimilated
form
every
thing
that
they
read
and
retail
and
repeat
it
in
that
undigested
form
to
every
listener
we
repeat
that
we
have
been
so
bored
by
friends
with
good
memories
that
we
have
resolved
to
endeavor
to
express
what
was
useful
out
of
facts
and
then
to
throw
the
facts
away
a
great
memory
is
a
disease
of
the
mind
which
we
are
surprised
no
medical
writer
has
noticed
the
lunatic
asylum
should
make
provision
for
those
affected
with
this
disease
for
though
less
dangerous
they
are
far
more
troublesome
and
annoying
than
any
other
class
of
lunatics
learning
observation
reading
are
only
useful
in
the
general
as
they
add
to
the
growth
of
the
mind
undigested
and
unforgotten
they
can
no
more
have
this
effect
than
undigested
food
on
the
stomach
of
a
dyspeptic
can
add
to
his
physical
stature
we
thought
once
this
thing
was
original
with
us
but
find
that
say
pursued
this
plan
in
writing
his
political
economy
he
first
read
all
the
books
he
could
get
hold
of
on
this
subject
and
then
took
time
to
forget
them
before
he
began
to
write
we
will
not
trouble
the
reader
further
for
the
present
with
our
egotisms
or
our
arguments
but
refer
him
to
the
whole
of
latter
day
pamphlets
to
prove
that
the
world
is
too
little
governed
and
therefore
is
going
to
wreck
we
say
to
the
whole
of
those
pamphlets
for
that
is
their
one
great
leading
idea
we
also
add
an
extract
from
the
speech
of
ulysses
in
the
play
of
troilus
and
cressida
that
beautifully
illustrates
and
enforces
our
thought
we
give
the
extract
because
it
is
a
play
that
few
read
it
being
on
the
whole
far
inferior
to
shakspeare
other
plays
and
by
few
considered
as
wholly
if
at
all
his
work
the
heavens
themselves
the
planets
and
this
centre
observe
degree
priority
and
place
insisture
course
proportion
season
form
office
and
custom
in
all
line
of
order
and
therefore
is
the
glorious
planet

in
nobler
eminence
enthron
and
amidst
the
other
whose
eye
corrects
the
ill
aspects
of
planets
evil
and
posts
like
the
commandment
of
a
king
sans
check
to
good
and
bad
but
when
the
planets
in
evil
mixture
to
disorder
wander
what
plagues

what
portents
what
mutiny

raging
of

of

quite
from
their

when

is

which
is
the
ladder
of
all
high
designs
the
enterprise
is
sick
how
could

what

oppugnancy
the
bounded
waters
should
lift
their
bosom
higher
than
the
shores
and
make
a
sop
of
all
this
solid
globe

be

too
we
promised
to
write
no
more
in
this
chapter
but
like
parthos
when
we
have
an
idea
we
want
to
give
others
the
benefit
of
it
we
agree
with
jefferson
that
all
men
have
natural
and
inalienable
rights
to
violate
or
disregard
such
rights
is
to
oppose
the
designs
and
plans
of
providence
and
can
not
come
to
good
the
order
and
subordination
observable
in
the
physical
animal
and
human
world
show
that
some
are
formed
for
higher
others
for
lower
stations
the
few
to
command
the
many
to
obey
we
conclude
that
about
nineteen
out
of
every
twenty
individuals
have
a
natural
and
inalienable
right
to
be
taken
care
of
and
protected
to
have
guardians
trustees
husbands
or
masters
in
other
words
they
have
a
natural
and
inalienable
right
to
be
slaves
the
one
in
twenty
are
as
clearly
born
or
educated
or
some
way
fitted
for
command
and
liberty
not
to
make
them
rulers
or
masters
is
as
great
a
violation
of
natural
right
as
not
to
make
slaves
of
the
mass
a
very
little
individuality
is
useful
and
necessary
to
society
much
of
it
begets
discord
chaos
and
anarchy
since
writing
this
chapter
we
have
received
our
copy
of
adams
work
we
congratulate
ourselves
on
our
success
in
learning
to
forget
here
is
the
passage
to
which
we
refer
one
consequence
of
the
disposal
of
the
colored
people
as
to
individual
control
is
the
absence
of
mobs
that
fearful
element
in
society
an
irresponsible
and
low
class
is
diminished
at
the
south
street
brawls
and
conflicts
between
two
races
of
laboring
people
or
the
ignorant
and
more
excitable
portions
of
different
religious
denominations
are
mostly
unknown
within
the
bounds
of
slavery
our
great
source
of
disturbance
at
the
north
jealousy
and
collisions
between
protestant
and
irish
roman
catholic
laborers
is
obviated
there
when
the
remains
of
calhoun
were
brought
to
charleston
a
gentleman
from
a
free
state
in
the
procession
said
to
a
southern
gentleman
where
is
your
underswell
referring
to
the
motley
crowd
of
men
and
boys
of
all
nations
which
gather
in
most
of
our
large
places
on
public
occasions
he
was
surprised
to
learn
that
those
respectable
colored
men
and
boys
on
the
sidewalks
were
a
substitute
for
that
class
of
population
which
he
had
elsewhere
been
accustomed
to
see
with
repugnant
feelings
on
public
occasions
as
we
are
on
the
subject
of
adams
book
we
will
give
another
extract
from
it
confirmatory
of
our
doctrines
there
is
another
striking
peculiarity
of
southern
society
which
is
attributable
to
slavery
and
is
very
interesting
to
a
northerner
at
the
present
day
while
the
colored
people
are
superstitious
and
excitable
popular
delusions
and
fanaticisms
do
not
prevail
among
them
that
class
of
society
among
us
in
which
these
things
get
root
has
a
substitute
in
the
colored
population
spiritual
rappings
biology
mormonism
and
the
whole
spawn
of
errors
which
infest
us
do
not
find
subjects
at
the
south
there
is
far
more
faith
in
the
south
taken
as
a
whole
than
with
us
many
things
which
we
feel
called
to
preach
against
here
are
confined
to
the
boundaries
of
the
free
states
yet
the
white
population
are
readers
of
books
though
not
of
newspapers
perhaps
more
generally
than
we
that
vast
amount
of
active
but
uninstructed
mind
with
us
which
seizes
every
new
thing
and
follows
brilliant
or
specious
error
and
erects
a
folly
into
a
doctrine
with
a
sect
annexed
and
so
infuses
doubt
or
contempt
of
things
sacred
into
many
minds
is
no
element
in
southern
life
this
is
one
reason
why
there
is
more
faith
less
infidelity
at
the
south
than
at
the
north
the
opinions
of
a
lower
class
on
moral
and
religious
subjects
have
a
powerful
effect
on
the
classes
above
them
more
than
is
generally
acknowledged
and
hence
we
derive
an
argument
in
favor
of
general
education
in
which
moral
and
religious
principles
shall
have
their
important
place

it
seems
to
us
that
the
vain
attempts
to
define
liberty
in
theory
or
to
secure
its
enjoyment
in
practice
proceed
from
the
fact
that
man
is
naturally
a
social
and
gregarious
animal
subject
not
by
contract
or

as
locke
and
his

such
thing
as
liberty
because
it
is
unnatural
for
man
to
live
alone
and
without
the
pale
and
government
of
society
birds
and
beasts
of
prey
who
are
not
gregarious
are
naturally
free
bees
and
herds
are
naturally
subjects
or
slaves
of
society
such
is
the
theory
of
aristotle
promulged
more
than
two
thousand
years
ago
generally
considered
true
for
two
thousand
years
and
destined
we
hope
soon
again
to
be
accepted
as
the
only
true
theory
of
government
and
society
modern
social
reformers
except
carlyle
proceeding
upon
the
theory
of
locke
which
is
the
opposite
of
aristotle
propose
to
dissolve
and
disintegrate
society
falsely
supposing
that
they
thereby
follow
nature
there
is
not
a
human
tie
that
binds
man
to
man
that
they
do
not
propose
to
cut
sheer
asunder
is
true
after
their
work
of
destruction
is
finished
they
see
the
necessity
of
society
but
instead
of
that
natural
and
historical
society
which
has
usually
existed
in
the
world
with
its
gradations
of
rank
and
power
its
families
and
its
slaves
they
propose
wholly
to
disregard
the
natural
relations
of
mankind
and
profanely
to
build
up
states
like
fourierite
phalansteries
or
mormon
and
oneida
villages
where
religion
shall
be
banished
and
in
which
property
wife
and
children
shall
be
held
somewhat
in
common
these
social
establishments
under
a
despotism
like
that
of
joe
smith
or
brigham
young
become
patriarchal
and
succeed
so
long
as
such
despotism
lasts
that
is
when
the
association
loses
the
character
intended
by
its
founders
and
acquires
a
despotic
head
like
other
family
associations
it
works
well
because
it
works
naturally
but
this
success
can
only
be
temporary
for
nothing
but
the
strong
rule
of
a
cromwell
or
joe
smith
can
keep
a
society
together
that
wants
the
elements
of
cohesion
in
the
natural
ties
that
bind
man
to
man
and
cromwells
and
joe
smiths
are
not
to
be
found
every
day
is
an
historical
fact
that
this
family
association
this
patriarchal
government
for
purposes
of
defence
against
enemies
from
without
gradually
merges
into
larger
associations
of
men
under
a
common
government
or
ruler
this
latter
is
the
almost
universal
and
we
may
thence
infer
natural
and
normal
condition
of
civilized
man
in
this
state
of
society
there
is
no
liberty
for
the
masses
liberty
has
been
exchanged
by
nature
for
security
what
is
falsely
called
free
society
is
a
very
recent
invention
it
proposes
to
make
the
weak
ignorant
and
poor
free
by
turning
them
loose
in
a
world
owned
exclusively
by
the
few
whom
nature
and
education
have
made
strong
and
whom
property
has
made
stronger
to
get
a
living
in
the
fanciful
state
of
nature
where
property
is
unappropriated
the
strong
have
no
weapons
but
superior
physical
and
mental
power
with
which
to
oppress
the
weak
their
power
of
oppression
is
increased
a
thousand
fold
when
they
become
the
exclusive
owners
of
the
earth
and
all
the
things
thereon
they
are
masters
without
the
obligations
of
masters
and
the
poor
are
slaves
without
the
rights
of
slaves
it
is
generally
conceded
even
by
abolitionists
that
the
serfs
of
europe
were
liberated
because
the
multitude
of
laborers
and
their
competition
as
freemen
to
get
employment
had
rendered
free
labor
cheaper
than
slave
labor
but
strange
to
say
few
seem
to
have
seen
that
this
is
in
fact
asserting
that
they
were
less
free
after
emancipation
than
before
their
obligation
to
labor
was
increased
for
they
were
compelled
to
labor
more
than
before
to
obtain
a
livelihood
else
their
free
labor
would
not
have
been
cheaper
than
their
labor
as
slaves
they
lost
something
in
liberty
and
everything
in
rights
for
emancipation
liberated
or
released
the
masters
from
all
their
burdens
cares
and
liabilities
whilst
it
increased
both
the
labors
and
the
cares
of
the
liberated
serf
in
our
chapter
on
the
decay
of
english
liberty
we
show
that
the
whole
struggle
in
england
has
been
to
oppress
the
working
man
pull
down
the
powers
privileges
and
prerogatives
of
the
throne
the
nobility
and
the
church
and
to
elevate
the
class
the
extracts
from
the
era
and
northern
churchman
in
another
chapter
will
further
elucidate
this
subject
we
promised
to
confirm
our
doctrine
of
the
illusory
and
undefinable
character
of
liberty
and
slavery
by
extracts
from
standard
authors
paley
on
civil
liberty
to
do
what
we
will
is
natural
liberty
to
do
what
we
will
consistently
with
the
interest
of
the
community
to
which
we
belong
is
civil
liberty
that
is
to
say
the
only
liberty
to
be
desired
in
a
state
of
civil
society
i
should
wish
no
doubt
to
be
allowed
to
act
in
every
instance
as
i
pleased
but
i
reflect
that
the
rest
also
of
mankind
would
then
do
the
same
in
which
state
of
universal
independence
and
i
should
meet
with
so
many
checks
and
obstacles
to
my
own
will
from
the
interference
and
opposition
of
other
men
that
not
only
my
happiness
but
my
liberty
would
be
less
than
whilst
the
whole
community
were
subject
to
the
dominion
of
equal
laws
the
boasted
liberty
of
a
state
of
nature
exists
only
in
a
state
of
solitude
in
every
kind
and
degree
of
union
and
intercourse
with
his
species
it
is
possible
that
the
liberty
of
the
individual
may
be
augmented
by
the
very
laws
which
restrain
it
because
he
may
gain
more
from
the
limitation
of
other
men
freedom
than
he
suffers
by
the
diminution
of
his
own
natural
liberty
is
the
right
of
common
upon
a
waste
civil
liberty
is
the
safe
exclusive
unmolested
enjoyment
of
a
cultivated
enclosure
the
definitions
which
have
been
framed
of
civil
liberty
and
which
have
become
the
subject
of
much
unnecessary
altercation
are
most
of
them
adapted
to
this
idea
thus
one
political
writer
makes
the
essence
of
the
subject
liberty
to
consist
in
his
being
governed
by
no
laws
but
those
to
which
he
hath
actually
consented
another
is
satisfied
with
an
indirect
and
virtual
consent
another
again
places
civil
liberty
in
the
separation
of
the
legislative
and
executive
offices
of
government
another
in
the
being
governed
by
that
is
by
known
preconstituted
inflexible
rules
of
action
and
adjudication
a
fifth
in
the
exclusive
right
of
the
people
to
tax
themselves
by
their
own
representatives
a
sixth
in
freedom
and
purity
of
elections
of
representatives
a
seventh
in
the
control
which
the
democratic
part
of
the
constitution
possesses
over
the
military
establishment
montesquieu
on
liberty
there
is
no
word
that
has
admitted
of
more
various
significations
and
has
made
more
different
impressions
on
human
minds
than
that
of
some
have
taken
it
for
a
faculty
of
deposing
a
person
on
whom
they
had
conferred
a
tyrannical
authority
others
for
the
power
of
choosing
a
person
whom
they
are
obliged
to
obey
others
for
the
right
of
bearing
arms
and
of
being
thereby
enabled
to
use
violence
others
for
the
privilege
of
being
governed
by
a
native
of
their
own
country
or
by
their
own
laws
a
certain
nation
for
a
long
time
thought
that
liberty
consisted
in
the
privilege
of
wearing
a
long
beard
some
have
annexed
this
name
to
one
form
of
government
in
exclusion
of
others
those
who
had
a
republican
taste
applied
it
to
this
government
those
who
liked
a
monarchical
state
gave
it
to
monarchies
thus
they
all
have
applied
the
name
of
liberty
to
the
government
most
conformable
to
their
own
customs
and
inclinations
and
as
in
a
republic
people
have
not
so
constant
and
so
present
a
view
of
the
institutions
they
complain
of
and
likewise
as
the
laws
there
seem
to
speak
more
and
the
executors
of
the
laws
least
it
is
generally
attributed
to
republics
and
denied
to
monarchies
in
fine
as
in
democracies
the
people
seem
to
do
very
near
whatever
they
please
liberty
has
been
placed
in
this
sort
of
government
and
the
power
of
the
people
has
been
confounded
with
their
liberty
it
is
true
that
in
democracies
the
people
seem
to
do
what
they
please
but
political
liberty
does
not
consist
in
an
unrestrained
freedom
in
governments
that
is
in
societies
directed
by
laws
liberty
can
consist
only
in
the
power
of
doing
what
we
ought
to
will
and
in
not
being
constrained
to
do
what
we
ought
not
to
will
we
must
have
continually
present
to
our
minds
the
difference
between
independence
and
liberty
liberty
is
a
right
of
doing
whatever
the
laws
permit
and
if
a
citizen
could
do
what
they
forbid
he
would
no
longer
be
possessed
of
liberty
because
all
his
fellow
citizens
would
have
the
same
power
blackstone
on
liberty
the
absolute
right
of
man
considered
as
a
free
agent
endowed
with
discernment
to
know
good
from
evil
and
with
power
of
choosing
those
measures
which
appear
to
him
to
be
most
desirable
are
usually
summed
up
in
one
general
appellation
and
denominated
the
natural
liberty
of
mankind
this
natural
liberty
consists
properly
in
a
power
of
acting
as
one
thinks
fit
without
any
restraint
or
control
unless
by
the
law
of
nature
being
a
right
inherent
in
us
by
birth
and
one
of
the
gifts
of
god
to
man
at
his
creation
when
he
endued
him
with
the
faculty
of
free
will
but
every
man
when
he
enters
into
society
gives
up
a
part
of
his
natural
liberty
as
the
price
of
so
valuable
a
purchase
and
in
consideration
of
receiving
the
advantages
of
mutual
commerce
obliges
himself
to
conform
to
those
laws
which
the
community
has
thought
proper
to
establish
and
this
species
of
legal
obedience
and
conformity
is
infinitely
more
desirable
than
that
wild
and
savage
liberty
which
is
sacrificed
to
obtain
it
for
no
man
that
considers
a
moment
would
wish
to
retain
the
absolute
uncontrolled
power
of
doing
what
he
pleases
the
consequence
of
which
is
that
every
other
man
would
also
have
the
same
power
and
then
there
would
be
no
security
to
individuals
in
any
of
the
enjoyments
of
life
political
therefore
or
civil
liberty
which
is
that
of
a
member
of
society
is
no
other
than
natural
liberty
so
far
restrained
by
human
laws
and
no
farther
as
is
necessary
and
expedient
for
the
general
advantage
of
the
public
hence
we
may
collect
that
the
law
which
restrains
a
man
from
doing
mischief
to
his
fellow
citizens
though
it
diminishes
the
natural
increases
the
civil
liberty
of
mankind
but
that
every
wanton
and
causeless
restraint
of
the
will
of
the
subject
whether
practiced
by
a
monarch
a
nobility
or
a
popular
assembly
is
a
degree
of
tyranny
nay
that
even
laws
themselves
whether
made
with
or
without
our
consent
if
they
regulate
and
constrain
our
conduct
in
matters
of
mere
indifference
without
any
good
end
in
view
are
regulations
destructive
of
liberty
whereas
if
any
public
advantage
can
arise
from
observing
such
precepts
the
control
of
our
private
inclinations
in
one
or
two
particular
points
will
conduce
to
preserve
our
general
freedom
in
others
of
more
importance
by
supporting
that
state
of
society
which
can
alone
secure
our
independence
thus
the
statute
of
king
edward
iv
which
forbade
the
fine
gentlemen
of
those
times
under
the
degree
of
a
lord
to
wear
pikes
upon
their
shoes
or
boots
of
more
than
two
inches
in
length
was
a
law
that
savored
of
oppression
because
however
ridiculous
the
fashion
then
in
use
might
appear
the
restraining
it
by
pecuniary
penalties
could
serve
no
purpose
of
common
utility
but
the
statute
of
king
charles
ii
which
prescribes
a
thing
seemingly
as
indifferent
a
dress
for
the
dead
who
are
all
ordered
to
be
buried
in
woollen
is
a
law
consistent
with
public
liberty
for
it
encourages
the
staple
trade
on
which
in
great
measure
depends
the
universal
good
of
the
nation
so
that
laws
when
prudently
framed
are
by
no
means
subversive
but
rather
introductive
of
liberty
for
as
locke
has
well
observed
where
there
is
no
law
there
is
no
freedom
but
then
on
the
other
hand
that
constitution
or
frame
of
government
that
system
of
laws
is
alone
calculated
to
maintain
civil
liberty
which
leaves
the
subject
entire
master
of
his
own
conduct
except
in
those
points
wherein
the
public
good
requires
some
direction
or
restraint
the
idea
and
practice
of
this
political
or
civil
liberty
flourish
in
their
highest
vigor
in
those
kingdoms
where
it
falls
little
short
of
perfection
and
can
only
be
lost
or
destroyed
by
the
folly
or
demerits
of
its
owner
the
legislature
and
of
course
the
laws
of
england
being
peculiarly
adapted
to
the
preservation
of
this
inestimable
blessing
even
in
the
meanest
subject
very
different
from
the
modern
constitutions
of
other
states
on
the
continent
of
europe
and
from
the
genius
of
the
imperial
law
which
in
general
are
calculated
to
vest
an
arbitrary
and
despotic
power
of
controlling
the
actions
of
the
subject
in
the
prince
or
in
a
few
grandees
and
this
spirit
of
liberty
is
so
deeply
implanted
in
our
constitution
and
rooted
even
in
our
very
soil
that
a
slave
or
a
negro
the
moment
he
lands
in
england
falls
under
the
protection
of
the
laws
and
so
far
becomes
a
freeman
though
the
master
right
to
his
service
may
possibly
still
continue
next
to
personal
security
the
law
of
england
regards
asserts
and
preserves
the
personal
liberty
of
individuals
this
personal
liberty
consists
in
the
power
of
locomotion
of
changing
situation
or
removing
one
person
to
whatever
place
inclinations
may
direct
without
imprisonment
or
restraint
unless
by
due
course
of
law
concerning
which
we
may
make
the
same
observations
as
upon
the
preceding
article
that
it
is
a
right
strictly
natural
that
the
laws
of
england
have
never
abridged
it
without
sufficient
cause
and
that
in
this
kingdom
it
can
never
be
abridged
at
the
mere
discretion
of
the
magistrate
without
the
explicit
permission
of
the
laws
now
let
the
reader
examine
and
study
these
definitions
of
liberty
by
paley
montesquieu
and
blackstone
and
he
will
see
that
they
are
in
pursuit
of
an
ignis
fatuus
that
eludes
their
grasp
he
will
see
more
that
their
liberty
is
a
mere
modification
of
slavery
that
each
of
them
proposes
that
degree
of
restraint
restriction
and
control
that
will
redound
to
the
general
good
that
each
is
in
pursuit
of
good
government
not
liberty
government
that
liberty
is
surrendered
as
the
price
of
security
the
degree
of
government
must
depend
on
the
moral
and
intellectual
condition
of
those
to
be
governed
take
for
instance
blackstone
definition
of
civil
liberty
and
our
negro
slaves
enjoy
liberty
because
the
restrictions
on
their
free
will
and
free
agency
not
only
redound
to
public
good
but
are
really
necessary
to
the
protection
and
government
of
themselves
we
mean
to
involve
ourselves
in
no
such
absurdities
negroes
according
to
blackstone
paley
and
montesquieu
although
slaves
are
free
because
their
liberty
is
only
so
far
restricted
as
the
public
interest
and
their
own
good
require
our
theory
is
that
they
are
not
free
because
god
and
nature
and
the
general
good
and
their
own
good
intended
them
for
slaves
they
enjoy
all
the
rights
calculated
to
promote
their
own
interests
or
the
public
good
they
are
at
the
south
well
governed
and
well
protected
these
are
the
aims
of
all
social
institutions
and
of
all
governments
there
can
be
no
liberty
where
there
is
government
but
there
may
be
security
for
good
government
this
the
slave
has
in
the
selfish
interest
of
the
master
and
in
his
domestic
affection
the
free
laborer
has
no
such
securities
it
is
the
interest
of
employers
to
kill
them
off
as
fast
as
possible
and
they
never
fail
to
do
it
we
do
not
mean
to
say
that
the
negro
slave
enjoys
liberty
but
we
do
say
that
he
is
well
and
properly
governed
so
as
best
to
promote
his
own
good
and
that
of
society
we
do
mean
to
say
further
that
what
we
have
quoted
from
these
great
authors
is
all
fudge
and
nonsense
liberty
is
unattainable
and
if
attainable
not
desirable
liberty
of
locomotion
which
blackstone
boasts
of
as
one
of
the
rights
of
englishmen
belongs
to
the
mass
of
them
less
than
to
other
people
for
five
hundred
years
the
poor
laws
have
confined
the
poor
to
their
parishes
denied
them
the
right
to
bargain
for
their
own
wages
and
as
late
as
set
them
up
in
stalls
and
shambles
for
hire
like
cattle
liberty
in
england
as
in
rome
and
greece
has
been
and
is
now
the
privilege
of
the
few
not
the
right
of
the
many
but
in
rome
greece
and
the
southern
states
of
america
the
many
have
gained
in
protection
what
they
lost
in
liberty
in
england
the
masses
have
neither
liberty
nor
protection
they
are
slaves
without
masters
this
right
of
locomotion
of
choosing
or
changing
their
domicil
is
not
only
denied
to
the
mass
of
the
poor
but
in
all
countries
as
well
as
in
england
to
wives
to
children
to
wards
apprentices
soldiers
sailors
convicts
lunatics
and
idiots
take
then
this
test
of
liberty
and
how
little
of
it
is
there
in
england
but
in
fact
there
is
a
very
large
nomadic
class
of
beggars
rogues
and
journeymen
workmen
who
are
always
wandering
and
yet
who
are
the
most
wretched
members
of
society
and
its
greatest
pests
so
much
for
locomotion
great
as
the
difficulty
is
to
determine
what
is
liberty
to
ascertain
and
agree
on
what
constitutes
slavery
is
still
greater
slavery
in
its
technical
form
has
been
almost
universal
yet
not
exactly
alike
in
all
its
circumstances
and
all
its
regulations
in
any
two
ages
or
in
any
two
countries
in
very
many
ancient
states
the
power
of
life
and
death
was
vested
in
the
master
in
most
countries
the
slave
can
not
acquire
or
hold
property
legally
in
all
he
holds
more
or
less
by
the
permission
in
many
his
legal
right
to
separate
property
is
protected
by
law
even
in
cuba
he
can
compel
his
master
to
emancipate
him
upon
offering
an
adequate
price
and
in
some
cases
of
irreconcilable
disagreement
force
his
master
to
sell
him
to
another
master
it
is
remarkable
at
first
view
that
in
cuba
where
the
law
attempts
to
secure
mild
treatment
to
the
slave
he
is
inhumanly
treated
and
in
virginia
where
there
is
scarce
any
law
to
protect
him
he
is
very
humanely
governed
and
provided
for
in
cuba
many
of
the
slaves
are
savages
and
do
not
elicit
the
domestic
affection
of
the
master
who
sees
in
them
little
more
than
brutes
the
master
is
besides
often
an
absentee
and
tho
overseers
be
far
more
humane
than
irish
they
have
neither
the
interests
nor
feelings
of
resident
masters
but
the
most
efficient
cause
of
cruelty
and
neglect
is
the
african
slave
trade
which
makes
it
cheaper
to
buy
than
to
rear
slaves
in
virginia
the
slaves
have
advanced
much
in
morality
religion
and
intelligence
and
their
masters
and
mistresses
living
on
the
farm
with
them
naturally
become
attached
to
them
however
is
everywhere
the
strongest
motive
to
human
conduct
negroes
are
immensely
valuable
and
increase
rapidly
in
value
and
in
numbers
when
well
treated
the
law
of
secures
kind
and
humane
treatment
to
southern
slaves
all
the
legislative
ingenuity
in
the
world
will
never
enact
so
efficient
a
law
in
behalf
of
free
laborers
during
the
decline
of
the
roman
empire
slavery
became
colonial
or
prædial
the
slaves
occupied
the
place
of
tenants
or
serfs
were
adscripti
soli
and
could
only
be
sold
with
the
farm
many
antiquarians
consider
the
colonial
slavery
of
the
romans
as
the
true
origin
of
the
feudal
system
this
kind
of
slavery
was
universal
in
europe
till
a
few
centuries
since
and
now
prevails
to
a
great
extent
the
serfs
of
russia
poland
turkey
and
hungary
are
happier
and
better
provided
for
than
the
free
laborers
of
western
europe
they
have
homes
and
lands
to
cultivate
they
work
but
little
because
their
wants
are
few
and
simple
they
are
not
and
as
are
the
free
laborers
of
western
europe
hence
they
never
rise
in
riots
and
insurrections
burn
houses
commit
strikes
nor
do
they
emigrate
this
form
of
slavery
however
makes
the
master
an
idle
absentee
depriving
the
slaves
of
his
guardianship
his
government
and
his
protection
by
throwing
large
masses
of
the
ignorant
into
exclusive
association
with
each
other
it
promotes
and
increases
ignorance
negligence
and
idleness
men
will
not
improve
their
condition
who
have
no
examples
to
emulate
and
no
teachers
to
instruct
were
their
farms
conducted
as
ours
of
the
south
the
wealthy
would
have
ample
employment
and
the
slaves
or
serfs
find
in
their
masters
examples
governors
teachers
and
protectors
the
right
to
sell
one
children
or
one
self
into
slavery
has
been
very
common
and
is
now
practiced
in
china
the
ancient
germans
used
to
even
stake
their
liberty
at
games
of
hazard
this
would
never
have
been
done
nor
would
the
laws
have
permitted
it
if
the
situation
of
the
slave
had
been
greatly
inferior
to
that
of
the
free
but
how
shall
we
class
wives
children
wards
apprentices
prisoners
soldiers
and
sailors
they
are
not
free
because
their
personal
liberty
is
controlled
by
the
will
of
a
superior
not
by
mere
law
they
are
liable
to
confinement
and
punishment
by
their
superiors
whose
will
stands
in
place
of
law
as
to
them
they
have
no
right
of
locomotion
like
that
enjoyed
by
the
free
they
have
no
liberty
secured
by
law
they
are
not
free
are
they
therefore
slaves
paley
defines
slavery
to
be
an
obligation
to
labor
for
the
benefit
of
the
master
without
the
contract
or
consent
of
the
servant
the
sick
the
superannuated
the
infirm
and
the
infant
slaves
are
under
no
such
obligation
in
theory
or
practice
the
master
is
under
an
obligation
legally
theoretically
and
practically
to
labor
for
them
therefore
the
master
of
twenty
slaves
is
always
a
slave
himself
if
he
be
a
good
man
he
is
the
happier
for
performing
his
duties
as
slave
to
those
classes
of
his
slaves
but
what
becomes
of
that
slavery
of
the
ancients
and
of
china
where
the
slave
by
actual
contract
sells
himself
this
is
not
slavery
according
to
paley
the
great
and
glaring
defect
however
of
paley
definition
is
that
he
omits
the
obligation
on
the
master
to
provide
for
and
protect
the
slave
is
but
half
of
a
definition
and
that
half
false
it
does
often
happen
that
the
of
the
master
are
more
onerous
than
those
of
the
slave
yet
paley
omits
those
obligations
altogether
the
slave
when
capable
to
do
so
must
work
for
the
master
but
the
master
at
all
times
must
provide
for
the
slave
if
incapable
of
doing
so
the
law
gives
the
slave
a
new
master
and
protector
his
situation
is
less
honorable
but
far
more
secure
than
that
of
the
master
definitions
are
perilous
attempts
we
never
read
one
that
a
with
all
sail
set
might
not
drive
through
we
shall
define
nothing
ourselves
for
we
know
that
this
is
the
business
of
omnipotence
that
alone
knows
all
things
in
heaven
and
on
earth
we
proceed
to
examine
the
attempted
definitions
of
montesquieu
and
blackstone
blackstone
objects
to
the
right
to
sell
one
self
that
the
consideration
enures
to
the
buyer
this
may
or
may
not
be
so
according
to
the
laws
of
the
state
where
the
contract
is
made
it
is
not
a
necessary
feature
of
slavery
and
can
not
fairly
be
employed
as
an
objection
to
it
in
fact
the
slaves
of
the
south
in
their
houses
gardens
fruit
vegetables
pigs
and
fowls
hold
more
property
than
the
peasantry
of
europe
and
are
far
better
secured
in
its
possession
by
their
masters
than
that
peasantry
is
by
the
law
he
further
objects
that
in
case
of
absolute
slavery
not
only
the
liberty
but
the
life
of
the
slave
is
at
the
master
disposal
this
objection
is
false
and
puerile
in
no
civilized
country
has
the
master
the
right
to
kill
his
slave
the
protection
or
support
to
which
the
slave
is
entitled
would
be
an
ample
consideration
of
itself
for
the
sale
of
his
liberty
a
much
larger
one
than
the
capitalists
of
europe
would
be
willing
to
give
for
they
all
say
that
free
labor
is
cheapest
montesquieu
thus
defines
slavery
slavery
properly
so
called
is
the
establishment
of
a
right
which
gives
to
one
man
such
a
power
over
another
as
renders
him
absolute
master
of
his
life
and
fortune
this
is
french
liberty
under
the
rule
of
the
republican
bonapartes
and
english
liberty
under
cromwell
not
southern
slavery
france
is
always
happy
and
prosperous
with
a
master
and
the
masses
in
england
look
back
to
the
protectorate
with
fond
regret
these
despots
played
the
part
of
southern
masters
they
forced
the
strong
to
support
the
weak
the
rich
to
take
care
of
the
poor
the
nations
became
two
farms
or
families
western
europe
will
soon
have
to
choose
between
domestic
slavery
and
universal
slavery
democracy
and
liberty
are
antagonistic
for
liberty
permits
and
encourages
the
weak
to
oppress
the
strong
whilst
democracy
proposes
so
far
as
possible
to
equalize
advantages
by
fairly
dividing
the
burdens
of
life
and
rigidly
enforcing
the
performance
of
every
social
duty
by
every
member
of
society
according
to
his
capacity
and
ability
chapter
ix
paley
on
exploitation
paley
maintains
to
its
fullest
extent
the
doctrine
of
exploitation
which
we
have
endeavored
to
expound
and
illustrate
in
the
last
three
chapters
yet
neither
paley
nor
any
of
his
readers
were
ever
aware
of
its
tremendous
consequences
it
is
only
when
those
consequences
are
pointed
out
that
the
mind
revolts
at
the
theory
he
saw
and
said
that
capital
paid
labor
nothing
yet
discovered
no
iniquity
in
the
transaction
he
saw
that
labor
produced
every
thing
capital
nothing
and
all
that
the
capitalist
does
is
to
distribute
what
others
produce
he
should
have
added
after
retaining
the
lion
share
himself
our
whole
theory
is
to
be
found
in
a
single
paragraph
of
paley
and
if
there
be
nothing
strange
or
monstrous
in
his
theory
there
can
be
nothing
of
the
kind
in
ours
for
our
theories
are
identical
chapter
book
of
his
philosophy
under
the
head
of
the
treatment
of
our
domestics
and
dependants
he
employs
the
following
language
another
reflection
of
a
like
tendency
with
the
former
is
that
our
obligation
to
them
is
much
greater
than
theirs
to
us
it
is
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
the
rich
man
maintains
his
servants
tradesmen
tenants
and
laborers
the
truth
is
they
maintain
him
it
is
their
industry
which
supplies
his
table
furnishes
his
wardrobe
builds
his
houses
adorns
his
equipage
provides
his
amusements
it
is
not
the
estate
but
the
labor
employed
on
it
that
pays
his
rents
that
he
does
is
to
distribute
what
others
produce
which
is
the
least
part
of
the
he
should
have
added
but
far
the
most
profitable
part
a
few
additional
truths
and
this
paragraph
of
paley
would
be
an
admirable
description
of
cannibals
above
and
slaves
without
masters
below
his
servants
are
obliged
to
work
as
our
slaves
not
for
pay
but
for
an
allowance
out
of
the
proceeds
of
their
own
labor
his
employers
like
our
masters
only
distribute
something
of
their
earnings
to
the
laborers
giving
them
far
less
than
masters
give
to
slaves
retaining
more
to
themselves
and
hence
free
labor
is
cheaper
than
slave
labor
but
paley
did
not
comprehend
what
he
wrote
we
aided
by
the
socialists
will
try
to
make
it
understood
by
others
philosophy
can
not
justify
the
relation
between
the
free
laborer
and
the
idle
irresponsible
employer
but
is
easy
to
justify
that
between
master
and
slave
their
obligations
are
mutual
and
equal
and
if
the
master
will
superintend
and
provide
for
the
slave
in
sickness
in
health
infancy
and
old
age
if
he
will
feed
and
clothe
and
house
him
properly
guard
his
morals
and
treat
him
kindly
and
humanely
he
will
make
his
slaves
happy
and
profitable
and
be
himself
a
worthy
useful
and
conscientious
man
chapter

our
best
witnesses

masters
in

worth
damnation
save
their

and
these
but
as
a
kind
of
to
assert
my
right
as
lord
vision
of
judgment
we
intend
this
chapter
as
our
trump
card
and
have
kept
it
in
reserve
because
it
is
rash
to
lead
trumps
we
could
produce
a
cloud
of
witnesses
but
should
only
protract

thereby
we
call
into
court
horace
greely
wm
goodell
gerrit
smith
wm
lloyd
garrison
and
stephen
pearle
andrews
and
propose
to
prove
by
them
the
actual
leaders
and
faithful
exponents
of
abolition
that
their
object
and
that
of
their
entire
party
is
not
only
to
abolish
southern
slavery
but
to
abolish
also
or
greatly
to
modify
the
relations
of
husband
and
wife
parent
and
child
the
institution
of
private
property
of
all
kinds
but
especially
separate
ownership
of
lands
and
the
institution
of
christian
churches
as
now
existing
in
america
we
further
charge
that
whilst
actively
engaged
in
attempts
to
abolish
southern
slavery
they
are
busy
with
equal
activity
and
more
promise
of
success
in
attempts
to
upset
and
society
at
the
north
in
convening
these
gentlemen
as
witnesses
and
also
arraigning
them
on
trial
we
are
actuated
by
no
feelings
of
personal
or
disrespect
we
admire
them
all
and
have
had
kindly
intercourse
and
correspondence
with
some
of
them
they
are
historical
characters
who
would
seek
notoriety
in
order
to
further
their
schemes
of
setting
the
world
to
rights
we
have
no
doubt
of
their
sincere
philanthropy
and
as
little
doubt
that
they
are
only
paving
hell
with
good
intentions
we
speak
figuratively
we
shall
try
their
cause
in
the
most
calm
and
judicial
temper
we
would
address
each
of
them
in
language
borrowed
from
lord
byron
why
my
good
old
friend
for
such
i
deem
you
though
our
different
parties
make
us
fight
so
shy
i
mistake
you
for
a
foe
our
difference
is
political
and
i
trust
that
whatever
may
occur
you
know
my
great
respect
for
you
and
this
makes
me
regret
whatever
you
do
amiss
indeed
we
should
be
ungrateful
and
discourteous
in
the
extreme
if
we
did
not
entertain
kindly
remembrance
and
make
gentlemanly
return
for
the
generous
reception
and
treatment
we
received
especially
from
leading
abolitionists
when
we
went
north
to
personate
satan
by
defending
slavery
though
none
agreed
with
us
none
were
made
converts
by
us
yet
still
between
his
darkness
and
his
brightness
there
passed
a
mutual
glance
of
great
politeness
we
will
first
call
wm
goodell
to
the
stand
his
position
as
one
of
the
most
active
leaders
of
the
gerrit
smith
or
syracuse
wing
of
abolition
would
entitle
his
admissions
and
assertions
of
the
failure
of
his
own
society
to
the
greatest
credence
since
such
admissions
and
assertions
weaken
his
assaults
on
the
south
and
must
be
reluctantly
drawn
from
him
but
independent
of
his
peculiar
position
his
high
character
as
a
man
and
his
distinction
as
an
author
should
enlist
attention
and
command
respect
for
what
he
says
in
his
democracy
of
christianity
vol
page
he
thus
writes
and
what
is
this
pride
of
wealth
after
all
growing
up
into
the
aristocracy
of
wealth
the
usurpations
of
wealth
the
oppressions
of
wealth
grinding
the
masses
of
humanity
into
the
dust
throughout
our
modern
christendom
in
the
middle
of
our
nineteenth
century
civilization
and
progress
with
a
hoof
more
flinty
more
swinish
and
more
murderous
capitals
ours
than
that
of
feudalism
in
its
bloodiest
days
he
understands
the
intolerable
exploitation
of
capital
better
than
we
do
for
he
lives
in
a
country
where
slavery
has
not
stepped
in
to
shield
the
laborer
he
the
laborer
is
a
slave
without
a
master
and
his
oppressors
cannibals
all
g
book
appears
to
us
to
carry
the
doctrine
of
human
equality
to
a
length
utterly
inconsistent
with
the
power
and
control
which
ordinary
christian
marriage
gives
to
the
husband
over
the
wife
yet
be
assures
us
he
is
the
unflinching
friend
of
christian
marriage
the
purity
of
his
sentiments
revolt
at
the
conclusions
to
which
his
abstract
doctrines
inevitably
lead
yet
his
idea
of
christian
marriage
may
differ
so
far
as
the
power
of
the
husband
is
concerned
widely
from
ours
we
are
sure
he
would
do
nothing
designedly
to
impair
the
purity
and
sacredness
of
the

is
a
christian
socialist
and
looks
to
a
proximate
millenium
to
rectify
the
false
relations
of
men
and
property
in
his
own
society
and
to
the
arm
of
the
federal
government
to
set
things
right
in
the
south
why
not
leave
all
to
providence
especially
since
the
right
of
the
government
to
abolish
southern
slavery
is
denied
by
all
respectable
authority
outside
of
abolition
and
also
by
the
garrisonians
who
are
the
most
of
all
abolitionists
and
of
all
disorganizers
goodell
plan
of
rectifying
human
relations
at
the
north
by
a
millennium
is
quite
as
common
as
that
of
greely
andrews
and
owen
each
of
whom
has
discovered
a
new
social
science
that
they
are
sure
will
fit
the
world
because
it
wont
fit
a
village
we
really
think
that
a
man
of
goodell
nice
sense
of
justice
and
propriety
should
have
hesitated
long
ere
he
invoked
a
god
to
do
that
which
he
would
be
ashamed
to
do
himself
if
it
be
wrong
to
strip
the
rich
of
their
possessions
why
hope
or
expect
that
god
will
perpetrate
a
wrong
at
which
human
conscience
revolts
when
it
is
proposed
to
be
done
by
human
agency
after
an
elaborate
argument
to
prove
the
advent
of
a
millennial
state
of
society
through
the
instrumentality
of
christianity
goodell
on
page
vol
ii
of
his
democracy
of
christianity
thus
sums
up
and
concludes
glance
over
again
the
items
included
in
these
predictions
the
general
and
permanent
prevalence
of
peace
the
result
of
justice
security
and
the
actual
italics
his
by
each
and
every
one

and

that
is
of

sufficient
to
produce
the
needful
fruits
of
the
earth
or
in
some
way
a
supply
for
his
physical
wants
add
to
this
the
general
diffusion
and
great
increase
of
knowledge
especially
moral
and
religious
knowledge
which
includes
the
knowledge
of
social
relations
duties
and
rights
the
knowledge
that
implies
and
that
wisdom
which
begins
with
fear
of
the
lord
next
the
application
of
all
this
knowledge
wisdom
and
fear
of
the
lord
to
the
concerns
of
civil
government
insomuch
that
kingdoms
of
this
world
shall
become
the
kingdoms
of
christ
and
the
dominion
be
given
to
the
people
who
at
that
period
shall
have
become
purified
and
instructed
by
him
who
shall
all
be
righteous
who
all
know
the
lord
from
the
least
to
the
greatest
and
even
feeble
among
them
shall
be
as
david
to
this
add
general
contentment
and
enjoyment
facilities
of
social
and
international
intercourse
the
general
prevalence
of
the
spirit
of
benevolence
and
brotherly
love
and
the
absence
of
those
maddening
and
satanic
temptations
delusions
and
prejudices
that
have
so
long
deceived
enslaved
and
embroiled
the
nations
all
this
cemented
by
the
true
spiritual
worship
protection
and
love
of
the
common
father
of
all
men
is
any
thing
wanting
to
complete
the
picture
and
to
ratify
the
assurance
of
a
state
of
liberty
equality
common
brotherhood
common
interests
common
sympathy
and
common
participancy
in
social
rights
immunities
privileges
and
arrangements
must
we
need
be
told
in
addition
to
all
this
that
thrones
of
despotism
shall
be
cast
down
that
the
of
civil
and
ecclesiastical
tyranny
and
usurpation
the
persecutor
the
holy
apostles
and
people
shall
be
given
the
burning
flames
that
the
yoke
of
domination
be
dashed
into
pieces
as
a
vessel
that
shall
tread
upon
the
heels
of
subversion
and
one
despotism
overturn
another
till
he
right
it
is
shall
rule
that
the
masses
shall
be
elevated
the
exclusives
brought
low
that
the
shall
be
and
the
bowed
down
such
a
period
of
general
possession
general
justice
equality
and
contentment
as
has
been
already
and
previously
now
goodell
deplores
that
the
condition
of
his
society
is
so
bad
that
it
becomes
necessary
to
upset
and
reverse
it
by
a
millennium
is
not
this
considering
his
high
position
and
authority
strong
evidence
to
prove
the
failure
of
free
society
we
should
add
that
his
whole
book
teems
with
evidence
of
his
uncompromising
hostility
to
existing
church
institutions
and
the
existing
priesthood
as
abuses
and
interpolations
that
have
been
engrafted
improperly
on
christianity
he
obviously
belongs
in
faith
to
those
early
christians
who
resembled
the
essenes
in
their
social
relations
and
who
daily
expected
the
advent
of
the
millennium
their
error
in
the
last
respect
shows
that
it
is
the
bible
and
not
their
construction
of
it
that
should
be
our
rule
of
faith
and
guide
of
conduct
the
next
witness
we
call
up
is
gerrit
smith
a
man
who
has
a
national
reputation
as
an
orator
a
philanthropist
and
a
gentleman
who
writes
better
than
he
speaks
and
whose
active
charity
and
benevolence
are
only
exceeded
in
the
greatness
of
their
amount
by
the
grossness
of
their
misapplication
he
is
a
zealous
christian
yet
edits
or
did
edit
the
progressive
christian
which
proposed
to
abolish
christianity
as
now
understood
he
builds
churches
to
keep
out
the
clergy
and
heads
christian
conventions
to
put
down
christian
institutions
and
agrees
with
wendell
phillips
that
the
pulpit
of
the
north
stands
in
the
way
of
reform
delenda
est
the
pulpit
should
be
destroyed
like
goodell
he
seems
to
look
to
an
approaching
millenium
but
he
is
a
man
of
restless
activity
and
energy
and
of
incalculable
daring
and
would
put
his
shoulder
to
the
wheel
and
inaugurate
the
millenium
at
once
he
assumes
the
responsibility
declares
continually
in
speeches
lectures
and
essays
that
land
monopoly
is
an
intolerable
evil
that
lands
should
be
as
common
and
as
free
for
use
to
all
as
air
and
water
and
proposes
to
divide
them
at
once
he
is
one
of
the
largest
owners
of
real
estate
at
the
north
and
yet
the
most
uncompromising
agrarian
in
the
world
his
disinterestedness
is
only
exceeded
by
his
rashness
and
destructiveness
the
man
that
ever
cut
a
throat
or
scuttled
ship
his
amiableness
of
disposition
and
evenness
of
temper
never
desert
him
because
he
has
not
to
screw
his
courage
to
the
is
always
there
the
red
right
arm
of
thundering
jove
could
not
shake
his
tenacity
of
purpose
and
in
a
case
of
conscience
he
would
let
the
world
or
the
union
slide
with
equal
equanimity
si
fractus
illabitur
orbis
ímpavidum
ferient
ruinæ
he
gives
a
forty
thousand
or
so
to
kansas
emigrants
from
the
north
because
as
a
gentleman
he
feels
it
his
duty
to
stick
to
his
country
right
or
wrong
and
abolitionists
are
country
his
gross
eccentricities
and
intellectual
aberrations
are
but
the
natural
of
the
social
system
which
surrounds
him
and
which
reminds
him
and
every
other
ingenuous
and
candid
mind
that
whatever
is
is
he
is
only
seemingly
eccentric
and
erratic
he
feels
the
difficulty
of
disposing
of
his
immense
wealth
without
making
it
an
engine
of
oppression
and
exaction
he
understands
the
theory
of
capital
and
labor
as
his
speeches
show
knows
that
labor
produces
every
thing
and
that
capital
is
the
whip
that
forces
it
to
work
and
also
the
exploitator
that
robs
it
of
most
of
the
proceeds
of
its
industry
la
proprieté
le
vol
he
sees
is
true
save
in
the
impurity
of
motive
which
it
seems
to
attribute
to
its
owners
if
he
endows
colleges
or
gives
his
money
in
large
sums
to
individuals
in
the
one
case
it
is
used
to
rear
up
exploitators
who
rob
labor
by
professional
skill
and
in
the
other
to
those
who
use
it
at
once
as
an
engine
of
exaction
and
oppression
if
he
gives
it
in
smaller
sums
to
the
poor
he
is
generally
giving
to
the
idle
the
labor
of
the
industrious
and
offering
a
premium
to
continued
idleness
for
he
can
neither
control
the
conduct
nor
expenditure
of
his
beneficiaries
he
is
too
good
and
too
proud
to
spend
his
income
in
pomp
and
luxury
too
good
thus
to
waste
the
proceeds
of
labor
as
all
public
or
private
luxury
does
and
thus
increase
the
burdens
of
the
working
class
too
proud
to
derive
reflected
importance
and
standing
from
extraneous
glitter
and
costly
show
and
equipage
he
has
no
doubt
in
vain
attempted
to
ameliorate
the
condition
of
a
great
many
slaves
by
purchasing
them
and
emancipating
them
could
he
retain
them
as
slaves
he
might
see
that
his
charity
was
not
misapplied
by
educating
them
and
controlling
their
conduct
to
us
it
occurs
that
a
large
capital
can
only
be
safely
invested
in
slaves
and
hands
if
the
owner
wishes
to
be
sure
that
it
shall
not
be
used
as
an
engine
of
oppression
or
as
a
persuasive
to
idleness
and
dissipation
we
should
do
injustice
to
smith
were
we
not
to
add
that
he
is
quite
as
busy
in
abducting
negroes
as
in
buying
them
the
underground
railroad
is
one
of
his
favorite
pets
and
beneficiaries
his
restless
energy
is
not
satisfied
with
the
slow
proceedings
of
this
road
and
hence
he
buys
negroes
as
well
as
aids
the
abducting
of
them
he
has
been
severely
censured
for
buying
them
by
those
whom
he
supplies
with
the
means
to
steal
them
or
whom
he
rescues
from
the
fangs
of
the
law
when
caught
in
abortive
efforts
to
abduct
them
he
had
the
education
and
has
the
feelings
and
bearing
of
the
southerner
his
father
owned
slaves
and
a
territory
full
of
indians
and
he
was
reared
as
playmate
and
prince
in
their
midst
hence
he
has
the
proud
humility
of
the
southerner
not
the
exacting
and
supercilious
arrogance
of
the
northerner
he
does
not
demand
deference
and
respect
because
it
has
from
boyhood
been
yielded
to
him
as
his
due
by
admitted
inferiors
the
value
of
his
testimony
establishing
if
true
the
utter
and
entire
failure
of
free
society
can
not
be
over
estimated
he
is
learned
candid
honest
and
has
always
lived
in
free
society
its
subversion
which
he
proposes
and
actively
attempts
would
strip
him
of
millions
of
wealth
he
is
the
leading
champion
of
slave
abolition
and
by
admitting
the
failure
of
free
society
blunts
and
neutralizes
all
his
arguments
against
slavery
in
every
way
then
pride
of
opinion
seeming
consistency
and
pecuniary
interest
tempt
him
to
extol
not
to
condemn
free
society
it
is
true
he
thinks
slavery
also
a
failure
and
a
greater
failure
but
he
knows
little
practically
about
slave
society
and
can
not
admit
for
us
although
he
may
for
himself
and
his
en
passant
we
would
say
to
him
that
air
and
water
are
the
subjects
of
more
exclusive
appropriation
in
free
society
than
he
is
a
lawyer
and
knows
that
the
ownership
of
the
soil
carries
with
it
the
ownership
of
every
thing
ad
inferos
et
usque
ad
coelum
in
fact
in
cities
where
the
poor
most
do
congregate
their
food
and
raiment
differ
not
half
so
much
from
that
of
the
rich
as
their
enjoyment
of
pure
air
and
water
men
must
get
a
place
to
breathe
and
drink
from
and
all
places
are
appropriated
yes
smith
you
are
vainly
trying
to
grasp
the
right
the
right
is
connected
with
affected
by
and
affects
all
the
past
all
the
present
and
all
the
future
god
knows
the
right
man
only
the
expedient
our
next
witness
is
horace
greely
editor
of
the
tribune
and
napoleon
of
the
press
his
first
distinction
was
won
by
his
espousing
and
elaborately
propagating
the
social
philosophy
of
charles
casimir
fourier
this
he
did
some
twenty
years
since
in
a
long
controversy
with
the
courier
enquirer
the
latter
paper
sustaining
the
conservative
side
the
correspondence
was
afterwards
published
in
book
form
and
we
regret
that
we
have
not
been
able
to
possess
ourselves
of
a
copy
the
whole
edition
we
learn
was
burnt
at
the
harpers
consigned
by
providence
not
by
a
human
censor
to
the
flames
should
we
misrepresent
our
witness
it
will
be
because
we
have
tried
in
vain
to
get
this
book
we
think
he
was
the
first
in
america
to
assert
and
maintain
by
arguments
and
proofs
the
inadequacy
and
injustice
of
the
whole
social
and
governmental
organization
at
the
north
he
not
ourselves
is
the
american
author
of
the
theory
of
the
failure
of
free
society
his
remedies
though
not
as
radical
and
scientific
as
those
of
proudhon
and
andrews
did
very
well
for
a
beginning
he
we
think
proposed
at
once
to
coop
mankind
up
in
phalansteries
where
in
a
few
generations
all
the
distinctions
of
separate
property
and
of
separate
wives
and
children
would
be
obliterated
and
lost
and
society
would
gradually
and
gently
be
fused
and
crystalized
into
a
system
of
pure
and
perfect
communism
the
tribune
has
to
minister
to
a
variety
of
tastes
all
agreeing
in
their
destructive
tendencies
but
differing
widely
as
to
the
manner
in
which
they
shall
attain
their
conclusions
hence
it
is
hard
to
deduce
any
well
defined
system
of
philosophy
from
its
columns
andrews
intimates
that
our
witness
is
no
philosopher
at
all
be
it
so
yet
all
must
admit
that
no
man
of
the
age
has
the
organ
or
faculty
of
destructiveness
so
fully
developed
the
tribune
has
been
from
the
time
of
the
controversy
of
which
we
have
spoken
to
the
present
day
the
great
organ
of
socialism
of
free
love
and
of
all
the
other
isms
which
propose
to
overthrow
and
rebuild
society
and
government
or
to
dispense
with
them
altogether
steadily
pursuing
this
destructive
course
the
tribune
has
for
years
become
the
most
popular
paper
in
the
north
and
said
has
more
readers
in
europe
and
america
than
any
paper
in
the
world
and
yet
its
only
peculiar
thought
its
whole
intellectual
moral
social
and
political
stock
in
trade
consists
of
the
one
idea
variously
expressed
illustrated
and
enforced
the
failure
of
free
society
or
as
carlyle
phrases
it
we
must
have
a
new
world
if
we
are
to
have
any
world
at
all
what
a
striking
illustration
of
our
theory
that
a
mere
verbal
formula
often
distinguishes
a
truism
from
a
paradox
assert
a
theory
bluntly
and
plainly
and
attempt
to
prove
it
by
facts
and
arguments
and
the
world
is
ready
to
exclaim
oh
what
shocking
heresy
greely
for
twenty
years
maintains
the
same
theory
in
different
language
and
elicits
the
admiration
and
gratitude
of
the
world
oh
le
pauvre
peuple
how
long
will
it
permit
its
flatterers
to
deceive
and
betray
it
greely
and
ourselves
agree
in
our
destructive
philosophy
but
are
wide
asunder
as
the
poles
in
what
is
constructive
each
proposes
to
protect
the
weak
he
promises
protection
without
control
or
abridgment
of
liberty
we
tell
those
who
ask
for
or
require
protection
and
support
that
they
must
submit
to
be
controlled
for
that
the
price
of
security
has
ever
been
and
ever
will
be
the
loss
of
liberty
the
popularity
of
the
tribune
shews
that
the
world
is
prepared
to
upset
existing
social
systems
when
that
is
done
it
will
have
to
choose
between
free
love
and
slavery
between
more
of
government
and
no
government
we
think
like
carlyle
more
of
government
is
needed
we
too
are
a
socialist
for
free
society
but
we
would
screw
up
the
strings
of
society
not
further
relax
them
much
less
cut
them
sheer
asunder
we
wish
to
display
the
truth
and
nothing
but
truth
to
the
public
on
the
subjects
of
abolition
and
socialism
and
for
fear
of
misrepresentation
have
written
letters
to
greely
and
garrison
copies
of
which
we
shall
append
to
this
chapter
should
they
be
silent
the
letters
will
at
least
show
our
solicitude
to
arrive
at
truth
we
have
written
enough
about
andrews
and
quoted
enough
from
his
book
already
to
show
that
he
is
the
great
philosopher
of
his
party
and
the
comprehensive
and
truthful
expositor
of
its
doctrines
its
tendencies
and
ultimate
results
his
less
scientific
and
than
he
might
be
ready
to
exclaim
on
reading
his
book
thinkest
thou
thy
servant
a
dog
that
he
shall
do
this
thing
but
andrews
is
right
to
this
complexion
must
they
come
at
last
a
plunge
into
the
soft
and
sensual
waters
of
the
lake
of
free
love
then
a
sudden
and
violent
exit
into
the
keen
and
shivering
atmosphere
of
despotism
we
know
less
of
garrison
than
of
either
of
the
other
gentlemen
he
heads
the
extreme
wing
of
the
socialist
infidel
agrarian
and
abolition
party
who
are
called
garrisonians
he
edits
the
liberator
which
is
conducted
with
an
ability
worthy
of
a
better
cause
he
and
his
followers
seem
to
admit
that
the
bible
and
the
constitution
recognize
and
guarantee
slavery
and
therefore
denounce
both
and
propose
disunion
and
no
priests
or
churches
as
measures
to
attain
abolition
garrison
usually
presides
at
their
meetings
and
we
infer
in
part
their
principles
and
doctrines
from
the
materials
that
compose
those
meetings
a
will
rise
and
utter
a
philipic
against
marriage
the
bible
and
the
constitution
and
will
be
followed
by
negro
remond
who
spits
upon
washington
and
complains
of
the
invidious
distinction
of
calling
whites
and
negroes
africans
and
now
phillips
arises
armed
with
and
fury
and
gently
begins
in
tones
more
dulcet
and
with
action
more
graceful
than
belial
to
pour
the
sweet
milk
of
concord
into
hell
uproar
the
universal
peace
destroy
all
unity
on
earth
then
parker
will
edify
the
meeting
by
stirring
up
to
bloody
deeds
in
kansas
or
in
boston
in
which
as
becomes
his
cloth
he
takes
no
part
and
ends
by
denouncing
things
in
general
and
the
churches
and
parsons
in
particular
and
probably
the
whole
will
conclude
with
a
general
indulgence
and
remission
of
sins
from
andrews
who
assumes
for
the
nonce
the
character
of
father
confessor
and
assures
the
tender
conscience
that
it
is
right
and
incumbent
to
take
the
oath
to
sustain
the
constitution
with
the
deliberate
purpose
of
violating
it
because
such
oaths
are
taken
under
moral
duress
these
garrisonians
are
as
intellectual
men
as
any
in
the
nation
they
lead
the
black
republican
party
and
control
the
politicians
yet
are
they
deadly
enemies
of
northern
as
well
as
of
southern
institutions
now
gentlemen
all
of
you
are
philosophers
and
most
zealous
philanthropists
and
have
for
years
been
roaring
at
the
top
of
your
voice
to
the
oi
polloi
rats
that
the
old
crazy
edifice
of
society
in
which
they
live
is
no
longer
fit
for
human
dwelling
and
is
imminently
dangerous
the
rats
have
taken
you
at
your
word
and
are
rushing
headlong
with
the
haste
and
panic
of
a
sauve
que
peut
into
every
hole
that
promises
shelter
into
any
port
in
a
storm
some
join
the
rappists
and
shakers
thousands
find
a
temporary
shelter
in
fourierite
phalansteries
many
more
follow
andrews
to
trialville
to
villages
in
the
far
west
or
to
modern
times
and
a
select
few
to
the
saloons
of
free
love
and
hundreds
of
thousands
find
shelter
with
brigham
young
in
utah
whilst
others
still
more
frightened
go
to
consult
the
spiritual
telegraph
that
raps
hourly
at
the
doors
of
heaven
and
of
hell
or
quietly
put
on
their
ascension
robes
to
accompany
parson
miller
in
his
upward
flight
but
the
greater
number
are
waiting
very
impatiently
for
andrews
to
establish
his
new
and
better
world
or
for
garrison
and
goodell
to
inaugurate
their
millenium
why
gentlemen
none
of
these
worse
than
cassandra
vaticinations
why
none
of
this
panic
terror
confusion
and
flight
in
slave
society
are
we
suffering
and
yet
contented
is
our
house
tumbling
about
our
heads
and
we
sitting
in
conscious
security
amidst
the
impending
ruin
no
no
our
edifice
is
one
that
never
did
fall
and
never
will
fall
for
nature
plastic
hand
reared
it
supports
it
and
will
forever
sustain
it
have
we
not
shewn
in
this
single
chapter
that
the
north
has
as
much
to
apprehend
from
abolition
as
the
south
and
that
it
is
time
for
conservatives
every
where
to
unite
in
efforts
to
suppress
and
extinguish
it
we
add
hereto
a
letter
we
addressed
to
the
public
as
to
our
trip
to
the
north
and
our
reply
to
a
hogeboom
a
new
york
abolitionist
also
our
letters
to
garrison
and
greely
we
do
this
to
shew
that
we
intend
not
to
mislead
misrepresent
or
deceive
in
truth
the
leading
abolitionists
are
our
pets
and
favorites
we
have
an
inveterate
and
perverse
penchant
of
finding
out
good
qualities
in
bad
fellows
robespierre
and
milton
satan
are
our
particular
friends
my
trip
to
the
north
the
editors
of
the
gentlemen
i
hesitated
long
before
resolving
to
address
you
this
letter
i
feel
that
i
shall
be
amenable
to
the
charge
of
egotism
but
i
have
written
a
book
in
which
i
undertake
to
defend
and
justify
slavery
and
to
advise
the
south
as
to
its
future
policy
in
that
i
am
egotistical
as
every
one
is
who
writes
a
book
i
have
stepped
in
so
far
that
returning
were
more
tedious
than
go
i
will
not
do
things
by
halves
when
i
wrote
that
book
i
believed
that
government
law
religion
and
marriage
were
victims
bound
and
filleted
for
sacrifice
by
northern
abolition
what
was
then
matter
of
doubtful
opinion
inference
and
speculation
has
become
since
my
trip
to
the
north
subject
of
fixed
faith
and
conviction
i
enjoyed
the
warm
and
elegant
hospitality
of
some
of
the
liberty
party
of
the
north
i
was
in
social
intercourse
with
many
of
them
i
have
received
many
pamphlets
books
and
speeches
from
them
i
have
no
private
confidences
to
betray
because
i
heard
no
secrets
this
party
is
conscientious
believes
itself
right
and
courts
discussion
and
notoriety
i
besides
conversed
freely
with
strangers
in
public
conveyances
and
at
hotels
i
think
with
my
previous
study
on
the
subject
of
slavery
and
abolition
i
may
be
able
to
make
some
useful
suggestions
to
the
south
and
the
north
it
seemed
to
me
that
in
attempting
to
prove
free
society
a
failure
in
my
lecture
at
new
haven
i
was
but
carrying
coals
to
new
castle
the
liberty
party
at
least
discovered
that
long
before
i
did
and
are
as
intent
on
subverting
and
society
at
home
as
on
abolishing
slavery
with
us
a
part
of
them
i
will
not
undertake
to
say
how
large
a
portion
are
infidels
who
find
the
bible
no
impediment
to
their
schemes
of
social
reform
because
they
assert
that
it
is
false
this
wing
of
the
liberty
party
is
in
daily
expectation
of
discovering
a
new
social
science
that
will
remedy
all
the
ills
that
human
flesh
is
heir
to
they
belong
to
the
schools
of
owen
louis
blanc
fourier
comte
and
the
german
and
french
socialists
and
communists
the
other
wing
and
probably
the
most
numerous
wing
of
the
party
is
composed
of
the
millenial
christians
men
who
expect
christ
either
in
the
flesh
or
in
the
spirit
soon
to
reign
on
earth
the
lion
to
lie
down
with
the
lamb
every
man
to
sit
down
under
his
own
vine
and
fig
tree
all
to
have
an
interest
in
lands
marrying
and
giving
in
marriage
to
cease
war
to
be
abolished
and
peace
and
good
will
to
reign
among
men
they
are
as
intent
on
abolishing
all
church
government
and
authority
as
the
infidels
they
would
equally
with
them
trample
on
all
law
and
government
because
liberty
is
say
they
an
inalienable
right
and
law
religion
and
government
continue
to
protect
slavery
marriage
christian
marriage
which
requires
the
obedience
of
the
wife
is
slavery
and
they
would
modify
it
or
destroy
it
land
monopoly
they
say
gives
to
property
or
capital
a
greater
power
over
labor
than
masters
have
over
slaves
hence
they
very
wisely
and
logically
conclude
that
land
like
air
and
water
should
be
common
property
the
liberty
party
is
composed
of
very
able
men
of
philosophers
and
philanthropists
they
have
demonstrated
beyond
a
doubt
that
slavery
is
necessary
unless
they
can
get
up
a
millenium
or
discover
a
new
social
science
the
increasing
crime
and
poverty
of
mankind
and
the
utter
failure
of
all
social
experiments
like
those
of
owen
and
others
indicate
neither
the
advent
of
the
one
nor
the
discovery
of
the
other
this
liberty
party
are
the
best
allies
of
the
south
because
they
admit
and
continually
expose
the
utter
failure
of
free
society
one
of
the
most
distinguished
of
this
party
thus
writes
to
wendell
phillips
esq
i
can
not
refrain
from
expressing
in
this
connection
my
grief
that
many
abolitionists
have
allowed
their
faith
in
the
bible
to
be
shaken
in
my
short
trip
to
the
north
i
was
struck
with
nothing
so
much
as
the
avowed
infidelity
of
many
and
the
christianity
melting
into
infidelity
of
the
great
mass
of
the
balance
with
whom
i
conversed
i
have
no
doubt
however
that
although
such
a
state
of
things
is
too
common
at
the
north
yet
my
peculiar
associations
made
the
evil
appear
greater
than
it
really
is
the
religious
and
conservative
like
the
lily
of
the
valley
are
silent
and
secluded
as
a
specimen
of
this
religion
melting
as
i
think
into
infidelity
i
will
give
another
extract
from
the
letter
to
wendell
phillips
you
have
been
much
censured
for
holding
that
the
cause
can
reach
success
only
over
the
ruins
of
the
american
government
and
the
american
church
nevertheless
you
are
right
the
religion
which
tolerates
nay
sanctifies
slavery
must
necessarily
be
conquered
ere
the
devotees
and
dupes
of
that
religion
will
suffer
slavery
to
be
abolished
again
so
long
as
the
actual
government
is
on
the
side
of
slavery
the
bloodless
abolition
of
slavery
is
impracticable
the
author
of
the
letter
from
which
i
quote
and
phillips
to
whom
it
is
addressed
are
gentlemen
scholars
and
christians
they
are
besides
historical
characters
we
violate
no
privacy
in
holding
up
their
opinions
to
public
view
and
general
criticism
is
their
not
christianity
melting
into
infidelity
i
have
lately
received
a
book
in
two
volumes
entitled
the
democracy
of
christianity
from
its
author
william
goodell
of
new
york
a
member
of
the
liberty
party
the
author
evinces
much
ability
ingenuity
and
research
he
is
one
of
the
millenial
christians
obviously
pious
and
sincere
he
sees
no
exodus
from
the
appalling
evils
of
free
society
except
that
state
of
perfect
equality
peace
happiness
and
security
that
he
like
the
men
of
cromwell
day
thinks
is
promised
and
predicted
in
the
bible
i
cite
the
following
passage
from
the
conclusion
of
his
work
glance
over
again
the
items
included
in
these
predictions
the
general
and
permanent
prevalence
of
peace
the
result
of
justice
equity
security
and
the
actual
possession
by
each
and
every
one
of
vine
and
fig
tree
of
soil
sufficient
to
produce
the
needful
fruits
of
the
earth
or
in
some
way
a
supply
of
his
physical
wants
if
this
state
of
things
ever
occur
god
will
bring
it
about
without
the
help
of
abolitionists
we
do
not
deem
it
necessary
to
quote
from
the
infidel
agrarians
and
abolitionists
because
their
splendid
promises
and
bloody
and
disastrous
failures
have
been
matters
of
every
day
history
and
of
every
occurrence
from
the
times
of
marat
and
the
guillotine
to
those
of
lamartine
and
cavaignac
the
proletariat
of
france
the
nomadic
pauper
banditti
of
england
the
starving
tenantry
of
ireland
the
lazzaroni
of
italy
and
the
of
hayti
are
the
admitted
results
of
practical
abolition
but
say
the
liberty
party
abolition
has
stopped
abolish
churches
law
government
marriage
and
separate
property
in
lands
and
then
the
scheme
will
work
charmingly
well
possibly
it
will
but
as
we
are
very
happy
comfortable
and
contented
in
slave
society
suppose
you
try
the
experimentum
in
vile
corpus
begin
at
home
and
if
the
experiment
works
well
we
of
the
south
will
follow
your
example
you
have
a
little
eden
now
near
lake
oneida
some
hundreds
of
oneida
perfectionists
living
in
primitive
simplicity
among
whom
there
is
no
marrying
or
giving
in
marriage
no
separate
property
all
things
enjoyed
in
common
and
we
suppose
neither
priest
nor
officer
to
disturb
or
mar
the
harmony
of
millenial
society
we
but
tell
the
tale
as
was
told
to
us
does
it
work
well
if
so
why
not
form
all
your
institutions
on
that
model
you
of
the
liberty
party
seem
to
think
that
passional
attraction
and
attractive
labor
will
keep
all
men
up
to
their
duties
and
dispense
with
the
necessity
of
church
and
state
law
and
religion
priest
and
officer
you
think
you
follow
nature
but
in
truth
you
are
superficial
observers
of
nature
man
it
is
true
is
a
social
and
gregarious
animal
but
like
all
animals
of
that
kind
he
is
by
nature
and
the
ants
and
bees
are
ruled
by
despotic
and
exacting
governments
and
by
laws
and
regulations
wise
and
less
changeable
than
those
of
the
medes
and
persians
but
man
is
not
only
a
animal
but
a
religious
one
also
in
remitting
him
to
a
state
of
anarchy
and
infidelity
you
would
not
remit
him
to
a
state
of
nature
but
one
of
continuous
exterminating
warfare
such
as
france
witnessed
during
the
reign
of
terror
i
find
messrs
editors
that
i
am
somewhat
wandering
from
the
subject
with
which
i
commenced
and
will
conclude
for
the
present
at
least
very
respectfully
your
letter
to
hogeboom
to
hogeboom
sheds
corners
madison
county
dear
sir
your
letter
reached
this
office
during
my
absence
from
home
i
embrace
the
earliest
opportunity
of
replying
to
it
because
i
rejoice
that
public
attention
at
the
north
may
by
this
means
be
excited
to
the
subject
of
my
book
i
am
sure
i
should
not
have
been
honored
with
your
correspondence
had
you
read
the
book
and
known
its
subject
that
subject
is
the
failure
of
free
society
you
have
only
read
extracts
from
it
you
say
in
the
northern
papers
those
papers
will
be
slow
to
notice
the
facts
authorities
and
admissions
which
it
cites
to
prove
the
failure
of
their
form
of
society
i
send
you
the
book
and
refer
you
particularly
to
the
preface
to
the
second
and
third
chapters
and
to
the
summing
up
in
the
concluding
chapter
if
this
does
not
satisfy
you
that
free
society
is
a
cruel
failure
read
the
history
of
the
english
poor
laws
and
you
will
find
that
the
laboring
class
of
england
have
every
day
since
the
emancipation
of
the
villeins
been
in
a
worse
condition
morally
and
physically
than
any
slaves
ever
were
read
also
two
articles
the
one
in
the
north
british
review
and
the
other
in
blackwood
for
december
depicting
the
demoralized
and
starving
condition
of
the
whole
laboring
class
of
great
britain
read
also
carlyle
latter
day
pamphlets
if
this
does
not
convince
you
that
the
for
it
is
a
very
little
one
both
in
time
and
space
is
a
disastrous
and
cruel
failure
look
at
home
how
comes
it
that
your
distinguished
neighbor
gerrit
smith
proposes
to
make
land
as
free
for
the
enjoyment
of
all
as
air
and
water
confessedly
because
the
despotism
of
capital
over
labor
is
confessedly
because
your
form
of
society
is
found
to
be
a
failure
in
practice
why
does
another
distinguished
abolitionist
goodell
of
new
york
in
his
book
on
the
democracy
of
christianity
declare
that
wealth
now
is
more
cruel
oppressive
and
than
feudal
masters
why
does
greely
advocate
the
doctrines
of
fourier
and
propose
to
subvert
your
society
and
reconstruct
it
from
top
to
bottom
making
a
sort
of
common
property
of
women
and
children
as
well
as
of
lands
and
houses
why
does
much
your
ablest
philosopher
stephen
pearle
andrews
propose
plans
of
reform
still
more
sweeping
and
why
are
his
doctrines
popular
with
the
higher
classes
in
new
york
why
in
fine
are
the
larger
number
of
the
abolitionists
millenial
christians
in
daily
expectation
of
the
advent
of
christ
who
is
to
divide
all
property
equally
and
give
to
each
one
his
vine
and
fig
tree
and
why
are
the
others
atheists
like
owen
and
fourier
attempting
to
invent
new
and
better
forms
of
society

is

state

why
all

practicable

has

none
such
has
been
discovered
nobody
at
the
north
who
reads
my
book
will
attempt
to
reply
to
it
for
all
the
learned
abolitionists
had
unconsciously
discovered
and
proclaimed
the
failure
of
free
society
long
before
i
did
i
am
indebted
for
the
honor
of
your
correspondence
to
your
ignorance
of
what
my
book
contains
i
reply
through
the
press
because
i
intend
to
use
your
letter
merely
as
an
occasion
to
challenge
the
north
to
dispute
or
deny
my
assertion
that
free
society
is
a
failure
in
conclusion
i
propose
to
you
and
through
you
to
the
whole
north
these
questions
do
not
the
past
history
and
present
condition
of
free
society
in
western
europe
where
alone
the
experiment
has
been
fully
tried
prove
that
it
is
attended
with
greater
evils
moral
and
physical
than
slave
society
do
not
the
late
writers
on
society
in
western
europe
and
in
our
free
states
generally
admit
that
those
evils
are
intolerable
and
that
free
society
requires
total
subversion
and
should
you
not
therefore
abolish
your
form
of
society
and
adopt
ours
until
greely
or
brigham
young
or
andrews
or
goodell
or
some
other
socialist
of
europe
or
america
invents
and
puts
into
successful
practice
a
social
organization
better
than
either
or
until
the
millenium
does
actually
arrive
with
the
assurance
that
i
am
quite
as
intent
on
abolishing
free
society
as
you
are
on
abolishing
slavery
and
with
the
confidence
that
all
of
divine
authority
and
almost
all
of
human
authority
is
on
my
side
i
remain
your
and
obedient
servant

letter
to
garrison
royal
july
dear
sir
i
am
about
to
publish
a
work
entitled
cannibals
all
or
slaves
without
masters
i
shall
in
effect
say
in
the
course
of
my
argument
that
every
theoretical
abolitionist
at
the
north
is
a
socialist
or
communist
and
proposes
or
approves
radical
changes
in
the
organization
of
society
i
shall
cite
greely
goodell
andrews
gerrit
smith
yourself
and
other
distinguished
and
leading
abolitionists
of
both
sexes
as
proof
of
my
assertion
i
shall
also
endeavor
to
show
that
all
the
literary
mind
of
western
europe
concurs
with
you
you
i
perceive
have
read
a
work
already
written
by
me
and
will
not
mistake
my
object
we
live
in
a
dangerous
crisis
and
every
patriot
and
philanthropist
should
set
aside
all
false
delicacy
in
the
earnest
pursuit
of
truth
i
believe
slavery
natural
necessary
indispensable
you
think
it
inexpedient
immoral
and
criminal
neither
of
us
should
withhold
any
facts
that
will
enable
the
public
to
form
correct
opinions
should
you
not
reply
to
this
letter
i
shall
publish
a
copy
of
it
in
my
book
and
insist
that
your
silence
is
an
admission
of
the
truth
of
my
charges
i
regret
that
your
very
able
paper
reaches
me
irregularly
your
obedient

mass
letter
to
greely
royal
july
dear
sir
i
am
writing
a
work
entitled
cannibals
all
or
slaves
without
masters
i
shall
state
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
all
theoretical
abolitionists
assert
the
failure
of
free
society
and
each
proposes
some
plan
for
its
i
shall
cite
particularly
yourself
gerrit
smith
andrews
goodell
and
garrison
i
shall
rely
on
your
discussion
with
the
courier
and
enquirer
which
has
been
burnt
chiefly
as
my
proof
of
your
opinion
i
wish
to
afford
you
and
other
distinguished
gentlemen
an
opportunity
of
correcting
me
if
i
have
come
to
erroneous
conclusions
i
have
therefore
written
to
garrison
and
i
now
write
to
you
to
afford
you
an
opportunity
to
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
i
know
you
all
think
our
society
a
greater
failure
than
your
own
but
you
can
it
for
yourselves
not
for
us
i
shall
publish
a
copy
of
this
letter
in
my
book
if
you
do
not
reply
and
possibly
if
you
reply
both
this
letter
and
your
answer
is
not
possible
that
our
two
forms
of
society
can
long
all
christendom
is
one
republic
has
one
religion
belongs
to
one
race
and
is
governed
by
one
public
opinion
social
systems
formed
on
opposite
principles
can
not
with
much
respect
your
obedient
servant
geo
fitzhugh
before
parting
with
our
masters
in
the
art
of
war
we
must
abate
a
little
of
the
honors
we
have
lavished
on
them
we
have
said
that
they
discovered
and
proclaimed
the
failure
of
free
society
before
we
did
so
they
did
but
they
mistook
it
for
the
failure
of
all
society
their
little
world
of
western
europe
and
yankeedom
was
in
their
eyes
the
whole
world
hence
exclaims
carlyle
we
must
have
a
new
world
if
we
are
to
have
any
world
at
all
and
andrews
takes
up
the
cry
all
the
north
joins
in
chorus
and
sends
the
sad
knell
echoing
back
to
europe
not
so
fast
gentlemen
your
world
is
not
of
the
whole
world
and
all
is
peace
quiet
and
prosperity
outside
of
it
we
of
the
south
and
all
slave
countries
want
no
new
world
now
we
were
the
first
to
discover
and
proclaim
that
free
society
had
failed
and
failed
because
it
was
free
we
occupied
vantage
ground
a
good
saw
both
forms
of
society
and
thus
discovered
what
our
masters
had
overlooked
every
body
sees
it
now
and
gives
us
no
more
credit
for
the
discovery
than
his
cotemporaries

decay
of
english
liberty
and
growth
of
english
poor
laws
blackstone
whose
commentaries
have
been
for
half
a
century
a
common
and
whose
opinions
on
the
rise
growth
and
full
development
of
british
liberty
are
generally
received
as
true
as
well
in
america
as
in
europe
maintains
a
theory
the
very
opposite
of
that
for
which
we
are
about
to
contend
he
holds
that
the
appearance
of
the
house
of
commons
about
the
reign
of
henry
the
third
was
the
dawn
of
approaching
liberty
we
contend
that
it
was
the
origin
of
the
capitalist
and
moneyed
interest
government
destined
finally
to
swallow
up
all
other
powers
in
the
state
and
to
bring
about
the
most
selfish
exacting
and
unfeeling
class
despotism
he
thinks
the
emancipation
of
the
serfs
was
another
advance
towards
equality
of
rights
and
conditions
we
think
it
aggravated
inequality
of
conditions
and
divested
the
liberated
class
of
every
valuable
social
and
political
right
a
short
history
of
the
english
poor
laws
which
we
shall
annex
will
enable
the
reader
to
decide
between
us
on
this
head
he
thinks
the
reformation
increased
the
liberties
of
the
subject
we
think
that
in
destroying
the
noblest
charity
fund
in
the
world
the
church
lands
and
abolishing
a
priesthood
the
efficient
and
zealous
friends
of
the
poor
the
reformation
tended
to
diminish
the
liberty
of
the
mass
of
the
people
and
to
impair
their
moral
social
and
physical
he
thinks
that
the
revolution
by
increasing
the
power
of
the
house
of
commons
and
lessening
the
prerogative
of
the
crown
and
the
influence
of
the
church
promoted
liberty
we
think
the
crown
and
the
church
the
natural
friends
allies
and
guardians
of
the
laboring
class
the
house
of
commons
a
moneyed
firm
their
natural
enemies
and
that
the
revolution
was
a
marked
epoch
in
the
steady
decay
of
british
liberty
he
thinks
that
the
settlement
of
that
successfully
asserted
in
theory
the
supreme
sovereignty
of
parliament
but
particularly
the
supreme
sovereignty
of
the
house
of
commons
was
the
consummation
or
perfection
of
british
liberty
we
are
sure
that
that
settlement
and
the
chartering
of
the
bank
of
england
which
soon
succeeded
it
united
the
landed
and
moneyed
interests
placed
all
the
powers
of
government
in
their
hands
and
deprived
the
great
laboring
class
of
every
valuable
right
and
liberty
the
nobility
the
church
the
king
were
now
powerless
and
the
mass
of
the
people
wholly
unrepresented
in
the
government
found
themselves
exposed
to
the
grinding
and
pitiless
despotism
of
their
natural
and
hereditary
enemies
charles
dickens
who
pities
the
condition
of
the
negro
slaves
thus
sums
up
in
a
late
speech
the
worse
condition
of
the
slaves
without
masters
in
great
britain
beneath
all
this
is
a
mass
of
poverty
ignorance
and
crime
such
is
english
liberty
for
the
masses
thirty
thousand
men
own
the
lands
of
england
three
thousand
those
of
scotland
and
fewer
still
those
of
ireland
the
great
mass
of
the
people
are
cut
off
from
the
soil
have
no
certain
means
of
subsistence
and
are
trespassers
upon
the
earth
without
a
single
valuable
or
available
right
contrast
their
situations
with
that
of
the
old
villeins
and
see
then
whether
our
theory
of
british
liberty
and
the
british
constitution
be
true
or
that
of
blackstone
all
writers
agree
there
were
no
beggars
or
paupers
in
england
until
the
liberation
of
the
serfs
and
moreover
admit
that
slaves
in
all
ages
and
in
all
countries
have
had
all
their
physical
wants
sufficiently
supplied
they
also
concur
in
stating
that
crime
was
multiplied
by
turning
loose
on
society
a
class
of
men
who
had
been
accustomed
to
and
still
needed
the
control
of
masters
until
the
liberation
of
the
villeins
every
man
in
england
had
his
appropriate
situation
and
duties
and
a
mutual
and
adequate
interest
in
the
soil
practically
the
lands
of
england
were
the
common
property
of
the
people
of
england
the
old
barons
were
not
the
representatives
of
particular
classes
in
parliament
but
the
friends
and
faithful
and
able
representatives
of
all
classes
for
the
interests
of
all
classes
were
identified
monteil
a
recent
french
author
who
has
written
the
most
accurate
and
graphic
description
of
social
conditions
during
the
feudal
ages
describes
the
serfs
as
the
especial
pets
and
favorites
of
the
barons
they
were
the
most
dependent
obedient
and
useful
members
of
the
feudal
society
and
like
younger
children
became
favorites
the
same
class
now
constitute
the
proletariat
the
lazzaroni
the
gypsies
the
parias
and
the
pauper
banditti
of
western
europe
and
the
leperos
of
mexico
as
slaves
they
were
loved
and
protected
as
pretended
freemen
they
were
execrated
and
persecuted
lester
a
new
york
abolitionist
after
a
long
and
careful
observation
and
study
of
the
present
condition
of
the
english
laboring
class
solemnly
avers
in
his
glory
and
shame
of
england
that
he
would
sooner
subject
his
child
to
southern
slavery
than
have
him
to
be
a
free
laborer
of
england
but
it
is
the
early
history
of
the
english
poor
laws
that
proves
most
conclusively
that
the
liberation
of
the
villeins
was
a
sham
and
a
pretence
and
that
their
situation
has
been
worse
their
rights
fewer
and
their
liberties
less
since
emancipation
than
before
the
poor
laws
from
the
time
of
edward
the
third
to
that
of
elizabeth
were
laws
to
punish
the
poor
and
to
keep
them
at
work
for
low
wages
not
till
late
in
the
reign
of
elizabeth
was
any
charitable
provision
made
for
them
then
most
of
them
would
have
starved
as
the
confiscation
and
sales
of
the
church
lands
had
deprived
them
of
their
only
refuge
but
for
the
new
system
of
charity
the
rich
must
have
labor
and
could
not
afford
to
let
them
starve
although
they
were
ready
to
attempt
the
most
stringent
means
to
prevent
their
increase
in
the
edinburgh
review
october
on
poor
law
reform
we
find
the
following
admirable
history
and
synopsis
of
the
english
poor
laws
the
great
experiment
of
poor
law
amendment
which
has
now
for
seven
years
been
in
progress
among
our
southern
neighbors
appears
to
us
to
have
been
insufficiently
attended
to
and
therefore
to
have
been
imperfectly
understood
in
this
part
of
the
island
we
do
not
believe
that
many
of
our
scottish
readers
are
fully
aware
of
the
origin
of
the
english
poor
laws
of
the
changes
which
they
underwent
of
the
abuses
which
they
created
of
the
remedy
which
has
been
applied
or
of
the
obstacles
which
have
diminished
the
success
of
that
great
measure
and
now
threaten
its
efficiency
and
yet
these
are
subjects
of
the
deepest
interest
even
to
those
who
study
legislation
merely
as
a
science
a
series
of
laws
are
exhibited
persevered
in
for
centuries
by
a
nation
always
eminent
for
practical
wisdom
of
which
the
result
has
almost
invariably
been
failure
or
worse
than
failure
which
in
scarcely
a
single
instance
have
attained
their
objects
and
in
most
cases
have
produced
effects
precisely
opposite
to
the
intentions
of
their
framers
have
aggravated
whatever
they
were
intended
to
diminish
and
produced
whatever
they
were
intended
to
prevent
from
us
as
scotchmen
they
merit
peculiar
attention
not
only
from
the
resemblance
of
our
poor
laws
to
the
earlier
english
statutes
but
from
the
probability
that
as
the
connection
between
the
two
countries
becomes
more
intimate
we
shall
at
no
distant
period
follow
the
example
whatever
it
may
be
of
the
larger
country
to
which
we
are
united
and
participate
in
the
evils
and
advantages
of
the
system
which
she
may
finally
adopt
this
fate
already
threatens
ireland
it
is
scarcely
probable
that
scotland
can
avoid
it
each
of
the
subjects
to
which
we
have
alluded
would
require
a
volume
for
its
complete
development
but
we
are
constrained
to
give
to
them
such
consideration
as
is
admissible
within
the
limits
of
an
article
of
moderate
length
the
committee
of
the
house
of
commons
which
considered
the
poor
laws
in
commence
their
able
report
by
stating
that
the
principle
of
a
compulsory
provision
for
the
impotent
and
for
setting
to
work
the
originated
without
doubt
in
motives
of
the
purest
humanity
from
this
statement
plausible
as
it
is
we
utterly
dissent
we
believe
that
the
english
poor
laws
originated
in
selfishness
ignorance
and
pride
better
motives
without
doubt
though
misdirected
by
almost
equal
ignorance
dictated
the
changes
which
were
made
in
those
laws
during
the
century
the
fourth
which
elapsed
from
their
commencement
but
we
are
convinced
that
their
origin
was
an
attempt
substantially
to
restore
the
expiring
system
of
slavery
the
evils
of
slavery
are
now
understood
it
is
admitted
that
it
destroys
all
the
nobler
virtues
both
moral
and
intellectual
that
it
leaves
the
slave
without
energy
without
truth
without
honesty
without
industry
without
providence
in
short
without
any
of
the
qualities
which
fit
men
to
be
respected
or
even
esteemed
but
mischievous
as
slavery
is
it
has
many
plausible
advantages
and
freedom
many
apparent
dangers
the
subsistence
of
a
slave
is
safe
he
can
not
suffer
from
insufficient
wages
or
from
want
of
employment
he
has
not
to
save
for
sickness
or
old
age
he
has
not
to
provide
for
his
family
he
can
not
waste
in
drunkenness
the
wages
by
which
they
were
to
be
supported
his
idleness
or
dishonesty
can
not
reduce
them
to
misery
they
suffer
neither
from
his
faults
nor
his
follies
we
believe
that
there
are
few
of
our
highland
parishes
in
which
there
is
not
more
suffering
from
poverty
than
would
be
found
in
an
equal
russian
population
again
the
master
thinks
that
he
gains
by
being
able
to
proportion
the
slave
subsistence
to
his
wants
in
a
state
of
freedom
average
wages
are
always
enough
to
support
with
more
or
less
comfort
but
still
to
support
an
average
family
the
unmarried
slave
receives
merely
his
own
maintenance
a
freeman
makes
a
bargain
he
asks
whatever
his
master
can
afford
to
pay
the
competition
among
employers
forces
them
to
submit
to
these
terms
and
the
highly
paid
workman
often
wastes
his
extra
wages
in
idleness
and
debauchery
and
when
employment
is
abundant
that
is
when
his
services
are
most
wanted
he
often
tries
to
better
himself
by
quitting
his
master
all
this
is
disagreeable
to
masters
who
have
been
accustomed
to
the
apparent
economy
of
servile
labor
and
to
its
lethargic
obedience
the
great
motive
of
the
framers
of
the
earlier
english
poor
laws
was
to
remedy
the
latter
class
of
inconveniences
those
which
affect
or
appear
to
affect
the
master
the
motive
of
the
framers
of
the
later
acts
again
beginning
with
george
was
to
remedy
the
first
class
of
evils
those
which
affect
the
free
laborer
and
his
family
the
first
set
of
laws
were
barbarous
and
unskillful
and
their
failure
is
evident
from
their
constant
or
amendment
with
different
provisions
and
severer
penalties
the
second
set
had
a
different
fate
they
ultimately
succeeded
in
many
districts
in
giving
to
the
laborer
and
to
his
family
the
security
of
servitude
they
succeeded
in
relieving
him
and
those
who
in
a
state
of
real
freedom
would
have
been
dependent
on
him
from
many
of
the
penalties
imposed
by
nature
on
idleness
improvidence
and
misconduct
and
by
doing
this
they
in
a
great
measure
effected
though
certainly
against
the
intentions
of
the
legislature
the
object
which
had
been
vainly
attempted
by
the
earlier
laws
they
confined
the
laborer
to
his
parish
they
dictated
to
him
who
should
be
his
master
and
they
proportioned
his
wages
not
to
his
services
but
to
his
wants
before
the
poor
law
amendment
act
nothing
but
the
power
of
arbitrary
punishment
was
wanting
in
the
pauperized
parishes
to
a
complete
system
of
prædial
slavery
our
limits
will
not
allow
us
to
do
more
than
to
state
very
briefly
the
material
parts
of
the
numerous
statutes
beginning
by
the
statute
of
laborers
edward
and
ending
by
the
eliz
cap
which
were
passed
for
the
supposed
benefit
of
masters
the
ed
iii
requires
all
servants
to
accept
the
wages
which
were
usually
given
five
or
six
years
before
and
to
serve
by
the
year
not
by
the
day
it
fixes
a
positive
rate
of
wages
in
many
employments
forbids
persons
to
quit
the
places
in
which
they
had
dwelt
in
the
winter
and
search
employment
elsewhere
in
the
summer
or
to
remove
in
order
to
evade
the
act
from
one
county
to
another
a
few
years
after
in
the
ed
iii
confirmed
the
previous
statute
and
added
to
the
penalties
which
it
imposed
on
laborers
or
artificers
absenting
themselves
from
their
services
that
they
should
be
branded
on
the
forehead
with
the
letter
it
imposed
also
a
fine
of
on
the
mayor
and
bailiffs
of
a
town
which
did
not
deliver
up
a
laborer
or
artificer
who
had
left
his
service
years
after
in
was
passed
the
rich
which
has
generally
been
considered
as
the
origin
of
the
english
poor
laws
by
that
act
the
acts
of
ed
iii
are
confirmed
laborers
are
prohibited
on
pain
of
imprisonment
from
quitting
their
residences
in
search
of
work
unless
provided
with
testimonials
stating
the
cause
of
their
absence
and
the
time
of
their
returning
to
be
issued
by
justices
of
the
peace
at
their
discretion
and
because
laborers
will
not
nor
for
a
long
season
would
not
serve
without
extrageous
and
excessive
hire
prices
are
fixed
for
their
labor
and
punishments
awarded
against
the
laborer
who
receives
more
and
the
master
who
gives
more
persons
who
have
been
employed
in
husbandry
until
twelve
years
of
age
are
prohibited
from
becoming
artisans
beggars
are
to
be
treated
as
laborers
wandering
without
passports
impotent
beggars
are
to
remain
where
they
are
at
the
time
of
the
proclamation
of
the
act
or
if
those
places
are
unwilling
or
unable
to
support
them
they
are
within
forty
days
to
repair
to
the
places
where
they
were
born
and
there
dwell
during
their
lives
we
have
said
that
this
act
has
been
treated
as
the
origin
of
the
english
poor
laws
it
has
been
so
considered
in
consequence
of
the
last
clause
which
is
the
first
enactment
recognizing
the
existence
of
the
impotent
poor
but
this
enactment
makes
no
provision
for
them
though
by
requiring
them
to
be
stationary
in
a
given
spot
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
it
seems
to
assume
that
they
would
be
supported
there
it
gives
them
however
no
claim
nor
is
there
a
clause
in
the
whole
act
intended
to
benefit
any
persons
except
the
employers
of
labor
and
principally
of
agricultural
labor
that
is
to
say
the
who
made
the
law
if
the
provisions
of
the
act
could
have
been
enforced
the
agricultural
laborers
and
they
formed
probably
of
the
population
of
england
though
nominally
free
would
have
been
as
effectually
as
any
polish
serf
and
to
make
a
nearer
approximation
to
slavery
in
the
next
year
the
rich
ii
was
passed
which
directs
the
justices
of
every
county
to
make
proclamation
every
half
year
at
their
discretion
according
to
the
price
of
food
what
wages
every
artificer
and
laborer
shall
receive
by
the
day
this
act
with
some
intervals
during
which
the
legislature
attempted
itself
to
fix
the
prices
of
labor
remained
substantially
in
force
until
the
present
century
a
further
attempt
to
reduce
husbandry
laborers
to
a
hereditary
caste
of
serfs
was
made
by
the
hen
iv
cap
which
after
reciting
that
the
provisions
of
the
former
acts
were
evaded
by
persons
apprenticing
their
children
to
crafts
in
towns
so
that
there
is
such
a
scarcity
of
husbandry
laborers
that
are
impoverished
forbids
persons
not
having
in
land
to
do
so
under
penalty
of
a
year
imprisonment
it
appears
however
that
the
laborers
did
not
readily
submit
to
the
villenage
to
which
the
law
strove
to
reduce
them
for
from
this
time
the
english
statute
book
is
deformed
by
the
enactments
against
persons
leaving
their
homes
or
refusing
to
work
at
the
wages
offered
to
them
or
loitering
that
is
to
say
professing
to
be
out
of
work
which
to
use
the
words
of
dr
burn
make
this
part
of
english
history
look
like
the
history
of
the
savages
in
america
almost
all
the
severities
have
been
inflicted
except
scalping
a
new
class
of
criminals
designated
by
the
terms
sturdy
rogues
and
vagabonds
was
created
among
these
were
included
idle
and
suspect
persons
living
suspiciously
persons
having
no
land
or
craft
whereby
they
get
their
living
idle
persons
calling
themselves
having
no
masters
persons
who
after
having
been
sent
home
absent
themselves
from
such
labor
as
they
shall
be
appointed
to
poor
persons
who
do
not
apply
themselves
to
some
honest
labor
or
other
or
serve
even
for
meat
and
drink
if
nothing
more
is
to
be
obtained
persons
able
to
labor
not
having
land
or
master
nor
using
any
lawful
employment
laborers
using
loitering
and
refusing
to
work
for
reasonable
wages
the
first
attempt
on
the
part
of
a
person
dependent
on
his
labor
for
his
support
to
assert
free
agency
by
changing
his
abode
or
by
making
a
bargain
for
his
services
or
even
by
refusing
to
work
for
bare
meat
and
drink
rendered
him
liable
to
be
whipped
and
sent
back
to
his
place
of
birth
or
last
residence
for
three
years
or
according
to
some
statutes
for
one
year
there
to
be
at
the
disposal
of
the
local
authorities
the
second
attempt
subjected
him
at
one
time
to
slavery
for
life
to
be
fed
on
bread
and
water
and
refuse
meat
and
caused
to
work
by
beating
chaining
or
otherwise
and
for
the
third
he
was
to
suffer
death
as
a
felon
we
have
seen
that
the
rich
ii
required
the
impotent
poor
to
remain
for
life
where
they
were
found
at
the
proclamation
of
the
act
or
at
the
places
of
their
birth
the
subsequent
statutes
require
them
to
proceed
either
to
their
places
of
birth
or
last
places
of
residence
for
three
years
the
law
assumed
as
we
have
already
remarked
that
they
would
be
supported
there
by
voluntary
alms
and
as
respects
the
it
assumed
that
an
slave
for
such
the
laborer
given
up
to
the
local
authorities
was
could
always
be
made
worth
his
maintenance
that
maintenance
being
of
course
the
lowest
that
could
keep
him
in
working
order
it
appears
however
that
casual
alms
were
found
an
insufficient
or
an
inconvenient
provision
for
the
impotent
that
the
local
authorities
were
not
sufficiently
severe
taskmasters
of
the
and
that
the
keeping
them
at
work
required
some
fund
by
way
of
capital
the
hen
viii
cap
therefore
requires
the
parishes
to
which
the
should
be
sent
to
keep
them
to
continual
labor
in
such
wise
that
they
may
get
their
own
living
by
the
continual
labor
of
their
own
hands
on
pain
that
every
parish
making
default
shall
forfeit
twenty
shillings
it
directs
the
churchwardens
and
two
others
of
every
parish
to
collect
alms
and
broken
meat
to
be
employed
in
supporting
the
impotent
poor
and
setting
and
keeping
to
work
the
sturdy
vagabonds
and
forbids
other
almsgiving
on
pain
of
forfeiting
ten
times
the
amount
this
is
the
first
attempt
at
making
charity
legal
and
systematic
and
it
was
obviously
a
part
of
the
scheme
for
confining
the
laboring
population
to
their
own
parishes
it
seems
to
have
been
supposed
that
voluntary
alms
systematically
distributed
would
provide
wholly
for
the
impotent
and
form
a
fund
which
aided
by
the
fruits
of
their
forced
labor
would
support
the
sturdy
vagabonds
and
therefore
that
no
one
could
have
an
excuse
for
changing
his
residence
in
the
early
part
of
elizabeth
reign
was
passed
a
statute
eliz
cap
inflicting
the
usual
penalties
whipping
slavery
and
death
on
sturdy
vagabonds
that
is
to
say
on
those
who
having
no
property
but
their
labor
presumed
to
act
as
if
they
had
a
right
to
dispose
of
it
and
containing
the
usual
provisions
for
confining
the
impotent
poor
to
their
parishes
in
one
respect
however
it
was
a
great
step
in
advance
for
it
contains
for
the
first
time
a
provision
enabling
the
justices
to
tax
at
their
discretion
those
who
refused
to
contribute
to
the
relief
of
the
impotent
and
the
keeping
at
work
the
concurrently
with
this
statute
and
indeed
as
a
part
of
it
for
it
is
the
next
chapter
on
the
roll
of
parliament
was
passed
the
eliz
cap
this
statute
requires
all
persons
brought
up
to
certain
specified
trades
at
that
time
the
principal
trades
of
the
country
and
not
possessed
of
property
or
employed
in
husbandry
or
in
a
gentleman
service
to
continue
to
serve
in
such
trades
and
orders
that
all
other
persons
between
twelve
years
old
and
sixty
not
being
gentlemen
or
students
in
a
school
or
university
or
entitled
to
property
and
not
engaged
in
maritime
or
mining
operations
be
compelled
to
serve
in
husbandry
with
any
person
that
will
require
such
person
to
serve
within
the
same
county
females
in
corporate
towns
between
the
ages
of
twelve
and
forty
and
unmarried
are
to
be
disposed
of
in
service
by
the
corporate
authorities
at
such
wages
and
in
such
sort
and
manner
as
the
authorities
think
meet
the
hours
of
work
are
fixed
by
the
statute
and
the
justices
are
twice
after
conferring
together
respecting
the
plenty
or
scarcity
of
the
time
to
fix
the
wages
persons
directly
or
indirectly
paying
more
are
to
be
punished
by
imprisonment
and
fine
persons
receiving
more
by
imprisonment
no
person
is
to
depart
from
one
parish
to
another
or
from
one
hundred
or
county
to
serve
in
another
hundred
or
county
without
a
license
from
the
local
authorities
when
we
recollect
that
disobedience
to
these
enactments
exposed
a
man
or
a
woman
to
be
included
in
the
proscribed
class
of
vagabonds
punishable
by
whipping
branding
slavery
and
death
it
must
be
admitted
that
whatever
might
be
the
practice
the
gave
little
freedom
to
the
laboring
classes
the
eliz
cap
carried
on
the
same
legislation
against
the
merely
aggravating
the
penalty
by
subjecting
the
offenders
that
is
all
persons
who
would
not
work
for
what
the
justices
should
think
reasonable
wages
to
whipping
and
burning
for
the
first
offence
and
to
the
penalties
of
felony
for
the
second
it
made
a
further
approach
to
the
present
system
by
directing
the
fund
for
setting
to
work
the
rogues
and
vagabonds
and
relieving
the
impotent
to
be
raised
by
a
general
assessment
years
afterwards
the
two
acts
of
the
eliz
cap
and
were
passed
which
for
the
first
time
divided
into
separate
statutes
the
punishment
of
the
and
the
relief
of
the
impotent
by
the
second
of
these
acts
vagabonds
including
we
repeat
persons
able
to
labor
having
no
lord
or
master
not
using
any
lawful
employments
and
laborers
refusing
to
work
for
common
wages
are
to
be
whipped
but
not
branded
sent
back
to
their
parishes
if
they
appear
to
be
such
as
will
not
be
reformed
they
are
to
be
transported
or
adjudged
perpetually
to
the
galleys
the
other
act
the
eliz
cap
differs
so
slightly
from
the
eliz
cap
that
it
requires
no
further
attention
the
of
eliz
directs
that
the
churchwardens
and
two
or
more
householders
to
be
appointed
by
the
justices
shall
take
order
with
the
consent
of
the
justices
for
setting
to
work
children
and
all
persons
having
no
means
to
maintain
themselves
and
using
no
ordinary
or
daily
trade
of
life
to
get
their
living
by
and
to
raise
a
fund
by
taxation
of
the
inhabitants
for
such
setting
to
work
and
for
the
necessary
relief
of
the
lame
impotent
old
and
blind
poor
not
able
to
work
and
the
justices
are
directed
to
send
to
the
house
of
correction
or
common
jail
such
as
shall
not
employ
themselves
to
work
being
appointed
thereunto
as
aforesaid
it
appears
from
this
statement
that
the
of
elizabeth
deserves
neither
the
praise
nor
the
blame
which
have
been
lavished
on
it
so
far
from
having
been
prompted
by
benevolence
it
was
a
necessary
link
in
one
of
the
heaviest
chains
in
which
a
people
calling
itself
free
has
been
bound
it
was
part
of
a
scheme
prosecuted
for
centuries
in
defiance
of
reason
justice
and
humanity
to
reduce
the
laboring
classes
to
serfs
to
imprison
them
in
their
parishes
and
to
dictate
to
them
their
employments
and
their
wages
of
course
persons
confined
to
certain
districts
by
penalties
of
whipping
mutilation
and
death
must
be
supported
and
if
they
were
capable
of
labor
it
was
obvious
that
they
ought
to
be
made
to
contribute
to
the
expense
of
their
maintenance
thence
arose
the
provisions
for
relieving
the
impotent
and
setting
to
work
the
but
those
provisions
do
not
on
the
other
hand
deserve
the
censure
passed
on
them
by
the
committee
of
the
house
of
commons
in
they
were
not
of
a
nature
to
induce
the
industrious
to
relax
their
efforts
they
held
out
no
temptations
to
idleness
the
who
were
the
objects
of
the
elizabeth
were
those
who
having
no
means
to
maintain
themselves
used
no
ordinary
and
daily
trade
of
life
to
get
their
living
by
such
persons
were
by
the
previous
acts
criminals
the
work
to
which
they
were
to
be
put
was
forced
work
and
if
they
did
not
employ
themselves
in
it
being
thereunto
appointed
as
aforesaid
the
justices
were
to
commit
them
to
jail
the
industrious
laborer
was
not
within
the
spirit
or
the
words
of
the
act
this
was
indeed
the
complaint
of
lord
hale
the
plaster
says
his
lordship
is
not
so
large
as
the
sore
there
are
many
poor
who
are
able
to
work
if
they
had
it
and
had
it
at
reasonable
wages
whereby
they
might
support
themselves
and
their
families
these
are
not
within
the
provisions
of
the
law
and
it
was
long
before
the
legislature
assented
to
any
extension
of
the
elizabeth
the
and
will
iii
cap
passed
nearly
a
century
afterwards
to
the
intent
that
the
money
raised
for
the
relief
of
as
are
impotent
as
well
as
may
not
be
misapplied
requires
all
persons
receiving
relief
and
their
families
to
wear
a
badge
containing
a
large
roman
p
and
the
first
letter

for
only
in

has
the
experiment
been
made
on
a
large
scale
for
several
centuries
if
we
have
not
proved
its
total
and
disastrous
failure
in
england
in
our
sociology
and
in
this
chapter
we
are
resolved
to
prove
it
before
we
have
done
it
is
a
favorite
political
maxim
of
englishmen
that
taxation
and
representation
should
go
hand
in
hand
and
that
none
shall
be
taxed
without
their
own
consent
yet
in

britain
the
working
men
who
pay
every
cent
of
tax
are
not
represented
at
all
have
no
vote
in
elections
and
are
taxed
without
and
against
their
own
consent
whilst
the
capitalist
class
who
pay
no
taxes
but
as
gerrit
smith
truly
says
are
the
mere
conduits
that
pass
them
from

to

this
vampire
capitalist

chapter
xii
the
french
laborers
and
the
french
revolution
each
of
the
many
french
revolutions
was
occasioned
by
destitution
almost
amounting
to
famine
among
the
laboring
classes
each
was
the
insurrection
of
labor
against
capital
but
until
the
revolution
of
the
revolutionists
were
unconscious
alike
of
their
motives
and
their
objects
they
believed
till
then
that
political
changes
would
remedy
the
evils
which
oppressed
them
after
the
revolution
of
philosophers
and
statesmen
seeing
the
inadequacy
of
change
of
dynasty
or
of
political
policy
to
alleviate
the
distresses
of
the
great
working
classes
began
to
search
deeper
for
the
causes
of
social
embarrassment
suddenly
the
discovery
was
made
not
only
in
france
but
throughout
western
europe
that
the
disease
was
social
not
political
that
it
was
owing
to
the
too
unequal
distribution
of
capital
and
to
its
exploitation
of
labor
the
ablest
minds
saw
as
well
in
england
as
in
france
that
in
transferring
the
reins
of
government
from
the
hands
of
hereditary
royalty
and
nobility
to
those
of
the
capitalist
class
that
the
people
had
exchanged
a
few
masters
for
thousands
of
extortioners
never
did
so
vast
a
moral
intellectual
and
social
movement
arise
so
suddenly
and
spread
so
rapidly
the
thing
became
the
rage
and
fashion
even
in
america
our
northern
folks
affected
a
disease
which
they
did
not
feel
just
as
alexander
courtiers
aped
his
wry
neck
and
and
land
monopoly
became
the
constant
theme
of
conversation
lectures
speeches
books
and
essays
in
france
and
in
england
prior
to
there
had
been
a
few
socialists
such
as
fourier
and
simon
owen
and
fanny
wright
but
they
were
little
heeded
and
generally
considered
about
half
crazy
immediately
thereafter
by
far
the
greater
portion
of
the
literary
mind
of
europe
imbibed
in
whole
or
in
part
the
doctrines
of
these
early
socialists
the
infection
soon
reached
the
lower
classes
and
occasioned
revolution
intended
to
be
social
as
well
as
political
throughout
western
europe
the
provisional
government
in
france
which
immediately
succeeded
to
the
expulsion
of
louis
philippe
was
composed
entirely
of
socialists
and
its
programme
and
attempted
measures
were
thoroughly
socialistic
the
subject
of
the
condition
of
the
laboring
classes
in
europe
and
especially
in
france
was
handled
with
an
accuracy
of
detail
and
a
breadth
of
scientific
expression
in
a
review
of
our
own
work
in
the
literary
messenger
of
march
of
which
we
are
incapable
the
author
professor
of
virginia
is
our
corresponding
acquaintance
only
informed
by
letter
that
he
would
review
us
and
that
he
concurred
in
the
general
truth
of
our
theory
we
suggested
to
him
in
reply
that
he
should
from
his
vast
stores
of
learning
strengthen
our
main
positions
he
thought
the
suggestion
a
good
one
and
fulfilled
our
request
with
an
ability
and
learning
that
no
other
man
on
so
short
a
notice
could
have
done
as
we
have
prompted
if
not
caused
his
toil
we
make
no
apology
for
appropriating
so
much
of
his
review
as
seems
to
be
a
reply
to
our
suggestion
from
the
principles
as
laid
down
in
theory
and
exemplified
in
practice
we
proceed
to
the
effects
that
religion
has
been
undermined
morals
contaminated
crime
increased
misery
extended
deepened
and
multiplied
want
and
starvation
augmented
society
agitated
and
orderly
government
endangered
by
the
progress
of
the
prosperity
of
the
free
labor
system
is
evident
without
further
proof
to
any
one
who
reads
contemporary
literature
who
pays
attention
to
the
statements
of
newspapers
and
of
poor
law
reports
who
notes
the
cases
brought
before
the
police
or
criminal
courts
or
is
cognizant
from
any
source
of
information
of
the
actual
condition
of
the
multitude
and
of
the
poor
in
england
scotland
ireland
france
germany
prussia
and
parts
of
switzerland
and
in
new
england
and
the
northern
states
the
connection
of
the
results
with
the
causes
is
ably
traced
by
fitzhugh
but
not
with
sufficient
care
minuteness
and
precision
and
the
actual
character
and
enormity
of
the
results
is
exhibited
by
him
and
by
an
indefinite
array
of
the
most
various
and
unexceptionable
testimony
the
history
of
the
working
classes
by
robert
du
var
which
we
have
joined
with
the
sociology
for
the
south
as
the
text
for
the
present
observations
is
full
of
evidence
to
this
effect
with
regard
to
france
and
for
the
other
countries
specified
ample
testimony
may
be
easily
obtained
the
boston
papers
will
suffice
to
illustrate
the
wretchedness
of
the
laboring
classes
in
new
england
the
new
york
herald
and
tribune
the
works
of
stephen
pearl
andrews
and
of
greeley
himself
will
render
the
same
service
for
the
other
northern
states
alton
locke
mary
barton
mayhew
london
labor
and
the
london
poor
the
debates
in
parliament
the
reports
of
the
poor
law
commissioners
and
the
english
reviews
will
amply
illustrate
the
condition
of
great
britain
and
ireland
and
for
germany
reference
may
be
made
to
hacklander
europarsches
sclavenleben
a
work
which
has
followed
the
example
of
uncle
tom
cabin
and
portrayed
the
condition
of
the
inferior
classes
in
europe
as
a
much
more
legitimate
object
of
european
sympathy
and
consideration
than
american
slavery
where
the
evidence
is
so
abundant
and
voluminous
selection
would
be
as
unnecessary
as
it
would
be
tedious
it
is
within
the
reach
of
every
one
who
desires
to
consult
it
and
we
need
not
load
our
pages
with
extracts
to
prove
what
has
been
frequently
and
sufficiently
proved
before
and
what
is
so
notoriously
true
as
to
be
undeniable
a
few
quotations
to
illustrate
the
condition
of
free
labor
societies
we
may
indeed
quote
at
a
later
period
in
connection
with
a
different
division
of
the
argument
but
they
are
wholly
unnecessary
to
confirm
the
allegation
of
the
wretchedness
and
depravity
which
are
consuming
the
vitals
of
the
principal
free
societies
of
the
nineteenth
century
they
are
rendered
still
more
unnecessary
by
the
fact
that
the
acceptability
of
socialism
in
all
of
those
communities
betrays
the
extent
of
both
the
misery
and
the
social
disease
to
be
cured
and
the
confession
of
the
multitude
of
recent
writers
on
social
topics
admits
not
merely
the
evils
which
we
have
specified
and
their
dependence
on
the
theory
and
practice
of
free
societies
but
acknowledges
also
the
truth
of
the
general
conclusion
that
the
free
societies
enumerated
have
unquestionably
failed
they
have
not
produced
the
permanent
or
general
blessings
anticipated
from
them
they
have
produced
overwhelming
social
disaster
multiplied
indefinitely
the
woes
and
the
vices
of
the
poor
threatened
all
society
and
government
and
national
existence
in
those
communities
and
announced
a
future
so
dark
that
little
more
than
its
gloom
and
spectral
shapes
can
be
distinctly
recognized
we
regard
fitzhugh
employment
of
these
admissions
by
european
writers
and
northern
reformers
as
constituting
the
most
important
position
of
his
argument
and
the
most
characteristic
novelty
in
his
defence
of
the
south
the
testimonies
which
he
adduces
are
very
strong
and
pointed
but
they
may
be
easily
multiplied
and
will
gain
an
accession
of
strength
from
such
multiplications
for
years
we
have
carefully
collected
similar
acknowledgments
from
foreign
writers
and
cheerfully
contribute
them
to
the
cause
of
the
south
and
the
fortification
of
fitzhugh
position
and
let
it
be
remembered
that
neither
in
the
sociology
for
the
south
nor
in
the
quotations
which
will
be
shortly
introduced
here
is
the
sole
or
principal
obligation
due
to
chartists
socialists
communists
or
agrarians
of
any
sort
from
such
authors
some
admissions
have
been
received
but
the
chief
contributions
are
derived
from
those
who
have
been
the
most
strenuous
supporters
of
past
social
arrangements
and
who
notwithstanding
a
great
diversity
of
views
abilities
studies
and
opportunities
of
knowledge
still
represent
the
sober
conservative
sense
of
their
respective
communities
we
regret
that
fitzhugh
should
have
extended
so
much
countenance
to
the
socialists
and
should
have
partially
identified
socialism
and
slavery
but
the
strongest
part
of
his
testimonies
to
the
failure
of
free
societies
is
derived
from
other
declarations
than
theirs
and
we
shall
imitate
his
example
we
begin
however
with
a
socialist
but
almost
the
only
one
whom
we
shall
summon
to
the
stand
the
french
revolution
was
an
abortion
the
trading
classes
organized
themselves
in
the
name
of
capital
and
instead
of
becoming
a
man
the
serf
became
a
prolétaire
what
then
was
his
situation
the
most
painful
of
all
the
most
intolerable
which
can
be
conceived
like
all
the
prolétaires
the
trading
classes
had
shouted
equality
fraternity
the
result
has
been
that
every
thing
which
was
prolétaire
that
is
to
say
all
those
who
have
no
capital
groan
under
the
most
cruel
usage
they
can
not
be
freemen
nor
brothers
nor
equals
not
free
because
their
daily
bread
depends
on
a
thousand
accidents
produced
and
engendered
by
the
competition
of
capitalists
among
themselves
not
brothers
because
with
hearts
crushed
and
lacerated
by
the
evils
which
overwhelm
them
they
can
not
love
those
whose
creed
is
so
fatal
to
them
not
equals
because
capital
being
the
supreme
law
it
is
only
through
it
that
any
participation
or
concurrence
in
social
power
is
possible
an
apology
is
due
for
not
attempting
to
translate
the
term
prolétaires
in
the
above
passage
but
every
one
familiar
with
the
condition
of
modern
free
societies
is
aware
that
it
is
absolutely
untranslateable
it
is
an
indispensable
word
in
modern
times
and
the
impossibility
of
avoiding
its
use
is
a
stronger
proof
of
the
failure
of
free
societies
than
the
invention
of
the
phrase
sociology
which
fitzhugh
regards
in
this
light
it
ought
to
be
unhesitatingly
introduced
into
the
english
language
it
can
boast
of
a
very
respectable
latin
descent
it
occurs
in
the
xii
tables
and
originally
signified
a
person
of
the
lowest
class
too
poor
to
pay
taxes
and
unable
to
serve
the
state
otherwise
than
by
raising
children
and
thus
increasing
the
population
a
very
doubtful
service
in
modern
europe
we
return
to
robert
du
var
it
must
be
remarked
that
what
is
called
pauperism
this
sore
this
ulcer
which
infests
and
more
and
more
consumes
the
body
social
could
not
exist
in
the
same
degree
amongst
the
nations
of
antiquity
it
is
a
phenomenon
which
could
only
arise
as
the
consequence
of
the
transformation
of
slavery
into
serfdom
and
of
serfdom
into
free
labor
in
antiquity
every
one
whether
free
or
not
citizen
or
slave
was
always
connected
with
some
centre
which
ensured
at
least
his
material
support
as
a
result
of
the
individual
liberty
independent
of
any
central
power
proclaimed
by
christianity
favored
and
developed
by
the
instincts
of
the
northern
barbarians
legitimated
and
transformed
into
a
social
doctrine
by
the
institution
of
communes
was
formed
and
agglomerated
throughout
europe
an
innumerable
population
having
no
material
connection
with
the
regular
society
and
having
for
itself
nothing
but
the
most
naked
liberty
that
is
to
say
misery
poverty
isolation
thence
issued
the
poor
the
beggars
the
thieves
in
one
word
parias
of
every
description
with
whom
society
was
compelled
to
compound
willingly
or
reluctantly
by
the
foundation
of
establishments
intended
to
palliate
the
bleeding
wound
of
the
pauperism
which
had
been
engendered
by
liberty
from
whatever
point
the
modern
system
is
regarded
it
seems
impossible
not
to
recognize
that
the
rule
of
free
competition
is
the
negation
as
its
name
indicates
of
all
ties
and
communion
of
interests
between
the
members
of
society
free
competition
is
a
free
field
open
to
every
individual
provided
or
not
with
the
elements
necessary
and
indispensable
to
its
manifestations
free
competition
in
a
word
is
liberty
but
liberty
without
other
rule
than
the
material
and
moral
force
of
which
each
one
may
be
able
to
dispose
in
the
presence
of
the
thousand
causes
which
produce
a
difference
in
the
position
of
individuals
but
we
say
that
a
system
which
thus
arms
morally
the
poor
against
each
other
is
a
barbarous
system
and
contrary
to
civilization
it
is
barbarous
inasmuch
as
it
developes
all
the
bad
tendencies
of
the
human
heart
it
is
contrary
to
civilization
because
instead
of
facilitating
harmonious
relations
among
men
it
inclines
them
to
mutual
repulsion
and
hostility
this
is
a
sufficient
sample
of
robert
du
var
testimony
the
greater
part
of
his
work
is
to
the
same
effect
and
there
is
a
singular
accordance
between
his
censures
of
political
economy
and
those
uttered
by
fitzhugh
they
merit
especial
attention
we
will
cite
another
socialist
vidal
the
ox
the
horse
the
hog
eat
according
to
their
hunger
their
desires
are
even
anticipated
they
have
their
subsistence
assured
it
is
the
same
thing
in
the
case
of
the
slave
for
the
ox
the
horse
the
hog
the
slave
belong
to
a
master
and
their
loss
is
the
loss
of
the
owner
perit
says
the
digest
but
with
the
hired
laborer
it
is
different
he
belongs
to
himself
his
death
is
the
loss
of
his
family
whom
he
maintained
and
who
will
no
longer
find
the
means
of
living
what
matter
to
an
employer
is
the
death
of
a
hired
laborer
are
there
not
every
where
millions
of
arms
always
ready
to
offer
themselves
at
reduced
wages
let
us
turn
to
evidence
of
a
different
character
here
is
sir
robert
peel
testimony
to
the
condition
of
ireland
before
previous
to
the
and
the
famine
it
may
be
assured
that
the
fourth
class
of
houses
according
to
the
census
are
generally
unfit
for
human
habitation
and
yet
it
would
appear
that
in
the
best
circumstanced
county
in
this
respect
the
county
of
down
per
or
of
the
population
live
in
houses
of
this
class
while
in
kerry
the
population
is
per
or
about
of
the
whole
and
taking
the
average
of
the
whole
population
of
ireland
as
given
by
the
census
commissioner
we
find
that
in
the
rural
districts
about
per
cent
of
the
families
and
in
the
civic
districts
about
per
cent
inhabit
houses
of
the
fourth
class
the
lowest
or
fourth
class
remember
comprises
all
mud
cabins
having
but
one
room
kay
from
whom
the
foregoing
remarks
of
sir
robert
peel
are
quoted
thus
comments
upon
a
murder
committed
in
open
day
in
ireland
the
two
murderers
had
escaped
why
he
asks
were
not
these
men
apprehended
because
of
the
rottenness
that
there
is
in
the
state
of
society
in
these
districts
because
of
the
sympathy
which
there
is
on
the
part
of
the
great
bulk
of
the
population
with
those
who
by
these
dreadful
acts
of
vengeance
are
supposed
to
be
the
conservators
of
the
rights
of
the
tenant
and
supposed
to
give
him
that
protection
which
imperial
legislation
has
denied
the
first
thing
that
ever
called
my
attention
to
the
condition
of
ireland
was
the
reading
an
account
of
one
of
these
outrages
i
thought
of
it
for
a
moment
but
the
truth
struck
me
at
once
and
all
i
have
seen
since
confirms
it
when
law
refuses
its
duty
when
government
denies
the
right
of
a
people
when
competition
is
so
fierce
for
the
little
land
which
the
monopolists
grant
to
cultivation
in
ireland
when
in
fact
for
a
bare
potato
millions
are
scrambling
these
people
are
driven
back
from
law
and
from
the
usages
of
civilization
to
that
which
is
termed
the
law
of
nature
and
if
not
of
the
strongest
the
law
of
the
vindictive
and
in
this
case
the
people
of
ireland
believe
to
my
certain
knowledge
that
it
is
only
by
these
acts
of
vengeance
periodically
committed
that
they
can
hold
in
suspense
the
arm
of
the
proprietor
and
the
agent
who
in
too
many
cases
if
he
dared
would
exterminate
them
a
pretty
result
this
for
free
labor
and
free
competition
and
abolitionism
to
have
arrived
at
but
ireland
was
always
esteemed
mauvais
let
us
cross
george
channel
the
english
peasant
is
thus
deprived
of
almost
every
motive
to
practice
economy
and
beyond
what
suffices
to
provide
his
family
with
food
and
clothing
once
a
peasant
in
england
and
a
man
can
not
hope
that
he
himself
or
his
children
will
ever
be
anything
better
than
a
mere
laborer
for
weekly
hire
this
unhappy
feature
of
an
english
peasant
life
was
most
powerfully
and
only
too
justly
depicted
in
those
articles
of
times
to
which
i
have
referred
above
it
was
there
shown
that
during
the
last
half
century
every
thing
has
been
done
to
deprive
the
peasant
of
any
interest
in
the
preservation
of
public
order
of
any
wish
to
maintain
the
existing
constitution
of
society
of
all
hope
of
raising
himself
in
the
world
or
of
improving
his
condition
of
life
of
all
attachment
to
his
country
of
all
feelings
of
there
really
existing
any
community
of
interest
between
himself
and
the
higher
ranks
of
society
and
of
all
consciousness
that
he
has
anything
to
lose
by
political
changes
and
that
every
thing
has
been
done
to
render
him
dissatisfied
with
his
condition
envious
of
the
richer
classes
and
discontented
with
the
existing
order
of
things
this
too
is
a
pretty
picture
which
is
not
relieved
by
the
further
information
that
in
the
year
there
were
it
is
said
in
england
alone
freehold
estates
in
the
hands
of
different
families
in
the
year
at
the
close
of
the
revolutionary
war
the
whole
of
the
lands
of
england
were
concentrated
in
the
hands
of
only
proprietors
what
is
the
result
the
labor
market
in
the
manufacturing
towns
is
constantly
overstocked
the
laborers
and
shopkeepers
find
new
and
eager
competitors
constantly
added
to
the
list
competition
in
the
towns
is
rendered
unnaturally
intense
profits
and
wages
are
both
unnaturally
reduced
the
town
and
the
town
gaols
are
crowded
with
inmates
the
inhabitants
are
overburthened
with
rates
and
the
towns
swarm
with
paupers
and
misery
i
know
not
what
others
may
think
but
to
me
it
is
a
sad
and
grievous
spectacle
to
see
the
enormous
amount
of
vice
and
degraded
misery
which
our
towns
exhibit
and
then
to
think
that
we
are
doing
all
we
can
to
foster
and
stimulate
the
growth
and
extension
of
this
state
of
things
by
that
system
of
laws
which
drives
so
many
of
the
peasants
of
both
england
and
ireland
to
the
towns
and
increases
the
already
vast
mass
of
misery
by
so
doing
i
speak
with
deliberation
when
i
say
that
i
know
of
no
spectacle
so
degraded
and
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
use
a
strong
word
so
horrible
as
the
back
streets
and
suburbs
of
english
and
irish
towns
with
their
filthy
inhabitants
with
their
crowds
of
filthy
and
degraded
children
playing
in
the
dirty
kennels
with
their
numerous
filled
with
people
whose
hands
and
faces
show
how
their
flesh
is
so
to
speak
impregnated
with
spirituous
liquors
the
only
solaces
poor
creatures
that
they
have
and
with
poor
young
girls
whom
a
want
of
religious
training
in
their
infancy
and
misery
has
driven
to
the
most
degraded
and
pitiful
of
all
pursuits
of
pauper
children
in
london
who
were
examined
confessed
that
they
had
been
in
prison
not
merely
once
nor
even
twice
but
some
of
them
several
times
had
run
away
from
their
homes
slept
in
the
had
lived
altogether
by
beggary
had
neither
shoes
nor
stockings
had
no
hat
or
cap
or
covering
for
the
head
had
no
linen
had
never
slept
in
a
bed
many
had
no
recollection
of
ever
having
been
in
a
bed
were
the
children
of
convicts
the
further
we
examine
the
more
painful
disgusting
and
incredible
does
the
tale
become
we
see
on
every
hand
stately
palaces
to
which
no
country
in
the
world
offers
any
parallel
the
houses
of
our
rich
are
more
gorgeous
and
more
luxurious
than
those
of
any
other
land
every
clime
is
ransacked
to
adorn
or
furnish
them
the
soft
carpets
the
heavy
rich
curtains
the
luxuriously
easy
couches
the
beds
of
down
the
services
of
plate
the
numerous
servants
the
splendid
equipages
and
all
the
expensive
objects
of
literature
science
and
the
arts
which
crowd
the
palaces
of
england
form
but
items
in
an
of
refinement
and
magnificence
which
was
never
imagined
or
approached
in
all
the
splendor
of
the
ancient
empires
but
look
beneath
all
this
display
and
luxury
and
what
do
we
see
there
a
pauperized
and
suffering
people
to
maintain
a
show
we
have
degraded
the
masses
until
we
have
created
an
evil
so
vast
that
we
now
despair
of
ever
finding
a
remedy
we
may
now
dismiss
kay
this
testimony
is
sufficiently
direct
and
sufficiently
ample
and
yet
it
would
have
been
easy
to
have
introduced
many
more
and
stronger
statements
made
by
him
which
have
been
omitted
because
they
were
loo
long
to
be
quoted
kay
is
neither
chartist
nor
socialist
he
is
a
graduate
of
trinity
college

a
and
has
traveled
over
europe
for
eight
years
under
an
appointment
from
the
senate
of
the
university
of
cambridge
as
traveling
bachelor
of
the
university
commissioned
to
travel
through
western
europe
in
order
to
examine
the
social
condition
of
the
poorer
classes
of
the
different
countries
the
evidence
of
such
a
man
should
be
authoritative
but
we
will
continue
our
quotations
it
is
undeniable
that
morality
has
declined
in
our
days
with
the
progress
of
knowledge
one
word
more
and
we
have
done
on
many
questions
of
practical
duty
men
are
now
affecting
to
be
wiser
and
better
than
the
bible
plans
of
social
progress
and
improvement
are
rife
that
have
an
air
of
transcendental
refinement
about
them
unknown
to
the
homely
morality
of
the
word
of
god
we
are
becoming
too
sentimental
to
endure
that
even
the
murderer
shall
be
put
to
death
and
now
we
are
for
bettering
ordinance
of
marriage
itself
and
we
see
a
fine
romantic
tender
charm
in
an
alliance
of
brothers
and
sisters
on
which
god
has
stamped
his
curse
what
may
such
things
betoken
are
they
ominous
of
such
unbridled
lawlessness
and
lust
as
marked
the
days
before
the
flood
are
they
signs
of
the
days
not
unlike
these
that
are
to
precede
the
coming
of
the
son
of
man
the
task
of
restoring
health
and
soundness
to
a
society
so
fearfully
diseased
as
ours
unquestionably
is
is
on
all
hands
acknowledged
to
be
at
once
the
noblest
and
the
most
imperative
to
which
citizens
or
statesmen
can
now
direct
their
energies
society
such
as
it
now
is
in
england
will
not
continue
to
endure
the
last
battle
of
civilization
is
the
severest
the
last
problem
the
knottiest
to
solve
out
of
all
the
multitudinous
ingredients
and
influences
of
the
past
out
of
the
conquest
of
nature
and
the
victory
of
freedom
out
of
the
blending
and
intermixture
of
all
previous
forms
of
polity
and
modifications
of
humanity
has
arisen
a
complex
order
of
society
of
which
the
disorders
and
anomalies
are
as
complex
as
its
own
structure
we
are
now
summoned
to
the
combat
not
with
material
difficulties
nor
yet
with
oppressors
nor
with
priests
but
with
an
imperfect
and
diseased
condition
of
that
social
world
of
which
we
form
a
part
with
pains
and
evils
appalling
in
their
magnitude
baffling
in
their
subtlety
perplexing
in
their
complication
and
demanding
far
more
clear
insight
and
unerring
judgment
than
even
purity
of
purpose
or
commanding
energy
of
will
this
conflict
may
be
said
to
date
from
the
first
french
revolution
and
it
has
been
increasing
in
intensity
ever
since
till
it
has
reached
to
a
vividness
and
solemnity
of
interest
which
surpasses
and
overshadows
the
attractions
of
all
other
topics
england
rapidly
accelerating
decline
is
a
very
remarkable
and
mournful
phenomenon
it
is
a
mortal
sickness
for
which
there
is
no
remedy
i
liken
the
english
of
the
present
day
to
the
romans
of
the
third
century
after
christ
the
analogy
might
be
extended
to
nearly
all
of
modern
civilization
tremendous
catastrophes
have
come
to
pass
and
there
is
no
resistance
not
a
semblance
of
great
men
no
joy
or
enthusiasm
no
hopes
for
the
future
except
that
the
time
will
one
day
come
when
by
means
of
mutual
instruction
every
peasant
boy
shall
be
able
to
read
the
truth
of
the
thing
is
the
unveiled
destitution
of
the
populace
who
are
resolved
to
bear
it
no
longer
and
this
again
paves
the
way
for
a
revision
of
property
which
is
not
indeed
something
new
under
the
sun
but
has
been
unheard
of
for
centuries
past
and
even
now
seems
quite
inconceivable
to
our
politicians
who
have
set
property
in
the
place
of
god
in
the
holiest
of
holies
c
we
can
not
venture
to
extend
our
extracts
though
we
have
the
materials
before
us
to
increase
them
ten
nay
we
contribute
these
merely
as
a
confirmation
of
position
that
really
and
confessedly
free
society
has
proved
a
calamitous
and
irremediable
failure

the
principal
communities

chapter
xiii
the
reformation
the
right
of
private
judgment
the
reformation
like
the
american
revolution
was
originated
and
conducted
to
successful
issue
by
wise
good
and
practical
men
whose
intuitive
judgments
and
sagacious
instincts
enabled
them
to
feel
their
way
through
the
difficulties
that
environed
them
wise
men
know
that
there
is
too
much
of
complexity
in
the
tangled
web
of
human
affairs
to
justify
the
attempt
at
once
to
practice
and
philosophise
to
act
and
to
reason
fools
and
philosophers
too
often
mar
the
good
works
of
such
men
by
pretending
to
see
clearly
and
to
define
accurately
the
principles
of
action
which
have
led
to
those
works
a
washington
a
peel
or
a
wellington
never
writes
himself
down
an
ass
by
appealing
to
abstract
principles
to
justify
measures
which
are
rendered
necessary
by
a
thousand
minute
and
peculiar
circumstances
of
the
hour
which
common
sense
and
experience
instinctively
appreciate
but
which
philosophy
in
vain
attempts
to
detect
or
to
generalize
common
sense
never
attempts
to
expel
nature
but
suggests
and
carries
through
a
thousand
useful
reforms
by
recurrence
to
and
comparison
with
the
past
and
by
cautious
experimentation
common
sense
sometimes
errs
by
excess
of
conservation
but
it
is
better
to
err
with
pope
who
thought
whatever
is
is
right
than
with
jefferson
whose
every
act
and
word
proves
that
he
held
that
whatever
is
is
the
reformation
was
not
the
thought
and
the
act
of
luther
calvin
cranmer
and
erasmus
but
the
thought
and
the
act
of
society
the
vox
populi
vox
dei
popes
and
cardinals
are
not
infallible
but
society
is
its
harmony
is
its
health
and
to
differ
with
it
is
heresy
or
treason
because
social
discord
inflicts
individual
misery
and
what
disturbs
and
disarranges
society
impairs
the
happiness
and
of
its
members
this
doctrine
of
the
infallibility
of
society
is
suggested
though
not
expressed
in
the
maxim
salus
populi
est
suprema
lex
the
puritans
in
the
early
days
of
new
england
acted
it
out
and
if
they
hung
a
few
troublesome
old
women
the
good
that
they
achieved
was
more
than
compensated
for
by
any
errors
they
may
have
committed
liberty
of
the
press
liberty
of
speech
freedom
of
religion
or
rather
freedom
from
religion
and
the
unlimited
right
of
private
judgment
have
borne
no
good
fruits
and
many
bad
ones
infidels
skeptics
millerites
mormons
agrarians
spiritual
rappers
wakemanites
free
negroes
and
bloomers
disturb
the
peace
of
society
threaten
the
security
of
property
offend
the
public
sense
of
decency
assail
religion
and
invoke
anarchy
society
has
the
right
and
is
in
duty
bound
to
take
care
of
itself
and
when
public
opinion
becomes
powerless
law
should
intervene
and
punish
all
acts
words
or
opinions
which
have
become
criminal
by
becoming
dangerous
or
injurious
we
would
rejoice
to
see
intolerance
of
error
revived
in
new
england
laxity
of
rule
and
laxity
of
public
opinion
is
sin
of
itself
and
leads
to
thousands
of
sins
new
england
is
culpable
for
permitting
parker
and
beecher
to
stir
up
civil
discord
and
domestic
broils
from
the
pulpit
these
men
deserve
punishment
for
they
have
instigated
and
occasioned
a
thousand
murders
in
kansas
yet
they
did
nothing
more
than
carry
into
practice
the
right
of
private
judgment
liberty
of
speech
freedom
of
the
press
and
of
religion
these
boasted
privileges
have
become
far
more
dangerous
to
the
lives
the
property
and
the
peace
of
the
people
of
this
union
than
all
the
robbers
and
murderers
and
malefactors
put
together
the
reformation
was
but
an
effort
of
nature
the
vis
medicatrix
naturæ
throwing
off
what
was
false
vicious
or
superfluous
and
retaining
what
was
good
the
great
men
of
the
day
but

larger
portions
of
the
common
thought
men
and
all
other
social
and
gregarious
animals

a
community
of
thought
of
motions
instincts
and
intuitions
the
social
body
is
of
itself
a
thinking

sentient
being
this
is
eminently
observable
with
the
lower
animals
bees
and
herds
perform
their
evolutions
with
too
much
rapidity
and
precision
to
leave
any
doubt
but
that
one
mind
and
one
feeling
either
from
within
or
without
directs
their
movements
the
great
error
of
modern
philosophy
is
the
ignorance
or
forgetfulness
of
this
fact
the
first
departure
from
it
was
not
the
reformation
for
that
was
preëminently
a
social
idea
and
a
social
movement
but
the
doctrine
of
the
right
of
private
judgment
which
speculative
philosophers
and
vain
schismatics
attempted
to
engraft
upon
it
or
deduce
from
it
human
equality

that

restricts
our

and
paralyzes
our

on

we
sometimes
think
the

of
the
alexandrian

was
a
providential
purification
just
as
the
fictitious
burning
by
cervantes
of

of

that
would

centuries
would
be
a
happy
our
revolution
so
wise
in
its
conception
and
so
glorious
in
its
execution
was
the
mere
assertion
by
adults
of
the
rights
of
adults
and
had
nothing
more
to
do
with
philosophy
than
the
weaning
of
a
calf
it
was
the
act
of
a
people
seeking
national
independence
not
the
utopian
scheme
of
speculative
philosophers
seeking
to
establish
human
equality
and
social
perfection
but
the
philosophers
seized
upon
it
as
they
had
upon
the
reformation
and
made
it
the
unwilling
and
unnatural
parent
of
the
largest
and
most
hideous
brood
of
ills
that
had
ever
appeared
at

since
the
opening
of
the

of

bills
of

acts
of

and

besprinkled
with
doctrines
directly
at

with
all

seem
to
be
the
basis
on
which
our
institutions
rest
but
only
seem
to
be
for
in
truth
our
laws
and
government
are
either
old
prescriptive
arrangements
or
else
the
gradual
accretions
of
time
circumstance
and
necessity
throw
our
paper
platforms
preambles
and
resolutions
guaranties
and
constitutions
into
the
fire
and
we
should
be
none
the
worse
off
provided
we
retained
our
institutions
and
the
necessities
that
begat
and
have
so
far
continued
them
all
government
proceeds
ab
extra
neither
individuals
nor
societies
can
govern
themselves
any
more
than
the
mouse
can
live
in
the
exhausted
receiver
or
the
clown
lift
himself
by
the
lappel
of
his
pantaloons
the
south
is
governed
by
the
necessity
of
keeping
its
negroes
in
order
which
preserves
a
healthy
conservative
public
opinion
had
the
negroes
votes
the
necessity
would
be
removed
because
the
interest
of
the
governing
class
would
cease
to
be
conservative
the
necessity
the
governing
power
ab

would
be
removed
the
little
republics
of
ancient
greece
were
able
to
preserve
the
most
artificial
social
arrangements
under
the
necessities
which
slavery
and
foreign
hostile
pressure
from
without
begat
they
were
afraid
of
change
because
insurrection
was
dangerous
if
government
on
paper
were
really
useless
and
harmless
we
should
say
nothing
about
it
but
it
is
fraught
with
danger
first
because
we
are
apt
to
rely
on
it
for
safety
and
security
of
rights
and
secondly
because
it
rarely
suits
the
occasion
men
and
societies
are
endowed
by
providence
generally
with
sufficient
knowledge
and
judgment
to
act
correctly
or
prudently
under
circumstances
as
they
arise
but
they
can
not
foresee
or
provide
for
the
future
nor
lay
down
rules
for
other
people
conduct
all
platforms
resolutions
bills
of
rights
and
constitutions
are
true
in
the
particular
false
in
the
general
hence
all
legislation
should
be
repealable
and
those
instruments
are
but
laws
fundamental
principles
or
the
higher
law
are
secrets
of
nature
which
god
keeps
to
himself
the
vain
attempt
of
frequent
recurrence
to
them
is
but
the
act
of
the
child
who
builds
card
houses
for
the
pleasure
of
knocking
them
down
recurrence
to
fundamental
principles
and
appeals
to
the
higher
law
are
but
the
tocsin
of
revolution
that
may
upset
everything
but
which
will
establish
nothing
because
no
two
men
are
agreed
as
to
what
the
higher
law
alias
fundamental
principles
is
moses
and
lycurgus
and
solon
and
numa
built
their
institutions
to
last
enjoined
it
on
the
people
never
to
change
them
and
threw
around
them
the
sanctity
of
religion
to
ward
off
the
sacrilegious
hand
of
future
innovation
a
frequent
recurrence
to
fundamental
principles
and
the
kicking
down
of
card
houses
was
not
part
of
their
science
of
government
we
have
often
thought
that
of
all
the
lost
arts
the
art
of
government
was
the
only
one
whose
loss
we
would
deplore
or
whose
recovery
is
worth
the
pains
of
study
and
research
to
us
it
seems
that
first
causes
fundamental
principles
and
the
higher
law
mean
one
and
the
same
thing
an
ignis
fatuus
that
it
is
dangerous
to
pursue
and
hopeless
to
overtake
we
may
be
doing
jefferson
injustice
in
assuming
that
his
fundamental
principles
and
seward
higher
law
mean
the
same
thing
but
the
injustice
can
be
very
little
as
they
both
mean
just
nothing
at
all
unless
it
be
a
determination
to
inaugurate
anarchy
and
to
do
all
sorts
of
mischief
we
refer
the
reader
to
the
chapter
on
the
declaration
of
independence
in
our
sociology
for
a
further
dissertation
on
the
fundamental
abstractions
on
which
our
glorious
institutions
to
repose
we
say
because
we
are
sure
neither
their
repose
nor
their
permanence
would
be
disturbed
by
the
removal
of
the
counterfeit
foundation
the
true
greatness
of
jefferson
was
his
fitness
for
revolution
he
was
the
genius
of
innovation
the
architect
of
ruin
the
inaugurator
of
anarchy
his
mission
was
to
pull
down
not
to
build
up
he
thought
everything
false
as
well
in
the
physical
as
in
the
moral
world
he
fed
his
horses
on
potatoes
and
defended
harbors
with
because
it
was
contrary
to
human
experience
and
human
opinion
he
proposed
to
govern
boys
without
the
authority
of
masters
or
the
control
of
religion
supplying
their
places
with
philosophy
and
morality
from
the
pages
of
lawrence
sterne
his
character
like
his
philosophy
is
exceptional
invaluable
in
urging
on
revolution
but
useless
if
not
dangerous
in
quiet
times
we
would
not
restrict
control
or
take
away
a
single
human
right
or
liberty
which
experience
showed
was
already
sufficiently
governed
and
restricted
by
public
opinion
but
we
do
believe
that
the
slaveholding
south
is
the
only
country
on
the
globe
that
can
safely
tolerate
the
rights
and
liberties
which
we
have
discussed
the
annals
of
revolutionary
virginia
were
illustrated
by
three
great
and
useful
men
the
mighty
mind
of
jefferson
fitted
to
pull
down
the
plastic
hand
of
madison
to
build
up
and
the
powerful
arm
of
washington
to
defend
sustain
and
conserve
we
are
the
friend
of
popular
government
but
only
so
long
as
conservatism
is
the
interest
of
the
governing
class
at
the
south
the
interests
and
feelings
of
many
holders
are
identified
with
those
of
a
comparatively
few
property
holders
it
is
not
necessary
to
the
security
of
property
that
a
majority
of
votes
should
own
property
but
where
the
pauper
majority
becomes
so
large
as
to
disconnect
the
mass
of
them
in
feeling
and
interest
from
the
property
holding
class
revolution
and
agrarianism
are
inevitable
we
will
not
undertake
to
say
that
events
are
tending
this
way
at
the
north
the
absence
of
laws
of
entail
and
primogeniture
may
prevent
it
yet
we
fear
the
worst
for
despite
the
laws
of
equal
inheritance
and
distribution
wealth
is
accumulating
in
few
hands
and
pauperism
is
increasing
we
shall
attempt
hereafter
to
show
that
a
system
of
very
small
entails
might
correct
this
tendency

what
they
acquire
by
depredation
from
the
industrious
provident

of

that
the
heads
of
these

are
remarkable
for
a
greater

they
make
us
marvel
why
the

is
distinguished
from

by
his
repugnance
to
regular

continuous
labor
by
his
want
of
providence
in
laying
up
a
store
for
the
future
by
his
inability
to
perceive
consequences
ever
so
slightly
removed
from
immediate
apprehension
by
his
passion
for
stultifying
herbs
and
roots
and
when
possible
for
intoxicating
fermented

for
his
extraordinary
powers
of
enduring
privation

comparative
insensibility

immoderate

to

from

will
the

on

and

there
live
then
in
the
midst
and
about
all
the
english
population
a
distinct
population
fearful
in
numbers
constantly
and
rapidly
increasing
having
a
language
manners
and
customs
of
its
own
living
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
in
a
course
of
life
the
most
immoral
and
profligate
and
yet
so
living
and
so
increasing
in
spite
of
the
laws
in
spite
of
the
municipal
arrangements
of
the
last
few
years
so
favorable
to
their
detection
and
punishment
in
spite
of
the
new
arrangements
and
in
spite
of
the
general
feeling
that
the
and
the
union
ought
to
provide
for
all
real
cases
of
destitution
and
misery
this
population
has
its
signs
its
terms
of
art
its
correspondence
its
its
barns
still
kept
open
and
even
by
farmers
and
country
gentlemen
its
its
and
even
recognized
lodging
houses
and
its
manifold
plans
to
extract
or
extort
to
win
or
to
scold
out
of
its
reluctant
but
deceived
victims
sums
amounting
we
are
inclined
to
believe
to
not
less
than
being
of
the
total
amount
of
this
sum
may
at
first
appear
utterly
extravagant
but
it
will
not
be
found
to
be
so
when
it
is
remembered
that
on
an
average
each
begging
family
extorts
per
annum
from
the
public
the
annual
poor
law
expenditure
for
the
year
ending
in
march
in
england
was
in
round
numbers
in
england
including
the
three
ridings
of
yorkshire
there
are
counties
the
population
of
those
counties
is
nearly
fifteen
millions
if
we
take
at
this
moment
a
rough
and
general
though
a
tolerably
correct
estimate
of
that
population
with
its
dense
misery
in
towns
and
cities
and
its
diffused
but
not
less
individually
intense
misery
in
the
agricultural
districts
we
may
fairly
calculate
that
one
out
of
every
one
hundred
is
a
beggar
or
lives
in
a
state
of
practical
vagrancy
looking
in
one
form
or
other
to
alms
for
support
the
part
of
the
population
is
and
if
each
begging
family
raising
per
annum
from
the
public
by
alms
be
estimated
as
consisting
of
six
we
shall
have
english
begging
families
raising
per
annum
each
or
the
total
sum
of
but
we
believe
that
we
have
underrated
instead
of
overstated
the
facts
of
the
case
in
these
calculations
in
london
alone
and
its
vicinity
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
of
the
police
a
very
large
part
of
that
sum
is
extorted
and
we
have
not
taken
into
consideration
the
wholesale
mendicity
which
is
now
deplorably
manifest
in
the
larger
english
manufacturing
towns
we
have
also
omitted
all
irish
mendicants
and
yet
they
are
nearly
in
the
proportion
of
one
to
three
in
the
english
agricultural
districts
naturally
anxious
as
we
are
to
avoid
even
the
appearance
of
exaggeration
we
are
still
bound
to
state
that
the
estimate
we
have
made
is
greatly
deficient
and
that
we
have
understated
the
real
statistics
the
begging
population
of
england
existing
and
increasing
in
spite
of
municipal
police
and
notwithstanding
the
penalties
of
the
vagrant
act
is
divided
into
several
classes
and
we
now
propose
to
draw
upon
a
little
pamphlet
mentioned
at
the
head
of
this
article
which
has
been
recently
published
at
birmingham
and
which
contains
very
accurate
details
of
the
mendicant
population
written
by
one
who
long
frequented
the
haunts
of
the
vagrant
community
the
portion
of
the
community
to
which
his
details
extend
belong
principally
to
the
hereditary
and
professional
class
of
beggars
the
writer
of
this
family
thus
proceeds
with
his
descriptive
details
order
fully
to
explain
each
individual
character
i
shall
begin
with
those
vagrants
who
generally
obtain
the
most
and
are
considered
of
the
and
are
by
some
termed
beggars
but
by
travelers
lurkers
are
persons
who
go
about
with
briefs
containing
false
statements
of
losses
by
fire
shipwrecks
accidents
the
seals
and
signatures
of
two
or
more
magistrates
are
affixed
to
those
briefs
and
they
are
so
well
written
that
thousands
of
persons
are
daily
imposed
upon
by
them
as
there
are
so
many
different
ways
used
by
these
persons
it
will
be
necessary
to
explain
each
of
them
separately
the
writer
then
enters
into
details
as
to
or
those
go
about
begging
for
loss
by
fire
they
have
false
briefs
pretended
to

course
lost

i
have
seen
briefs
of
this
description
from
almost
every
part
of
the
kingdom
he
goes
on
to
say
that
one
named
captain
johnstone
had
the
lurk
of
a
shipwrecked
captain
for
many
years
had
been
over
every

foreigner
considerable
numbers
proceed
on
this
lurk
representing
themselves
as
foreigners
in
distress
of
late
years
by
far
the
greatest
number
have
represented
themselves
as
noblemen
or
gentlemen
who
had
been
driven
by
the
tyranny
of
russia
from
their
native
country
to
seek
a
refuge
their
briefs
have
the
names
and
seals
of
two
magistrates
attached
and
are
always
well
written
whenever
they
present
their
briefs
they
affect
not
to
be
able
to
speak
a
word
of
english
and
the
few
words
they
utter
are
spoken
in
broken
accent
one
of
these
lurkers
known
among
mendicants
by
the
nickname
of
dundas
had
often
got
several
pounds
in
a
day
there
are
also
many
females
who
go
on
the
foreigner
lurk
i
knew
a
female
who
went
on
the
foreigner
lurk
who
dressed
very
well
she
had
a
boy
with
her
and
often
succeeded
in
getting
two
or
three
pounds
in
a
day
when
she
called
on
any
one
she
spoke
in
french
and
affected
not
to
be
able
to
converse
in
the
english
language
accident
lurkers
of
this
description
have
a
sham
and
delicate
brief
and
book
and
the
sham
states
that
by
some
dreadful
accident
the
bearer
has
lost
all
or
at
least
the
greater
part
of
his
property
sometimes
by
storm
and
at
other
times
by
a
flood
or
in
some
other
way
but
in
whatever
way
the
accident
has
happened
the
bearer
has
always
suffered
a
very
considerable
loss
and
is
deprived
of
the
means
of
supporting
himself
and
family
the
sums
raised
vary
from
five
shillings
to
a
pound
per
day
sick
this
is
worked
in
so
many
different
ways
that
it
will
be
necessary
to
say
a
little
on
each
it
would
seem
that
a
common
method
of
imposing
upon
the
public
is
by
applying
blistering
ointment
to
the
arms
causing
them
to
have
the
appearance
of
having
been
badly
scalded
that
others
go
about
with
hands
and
arms
tied
up
said
to
be
injured
by
lightning
or
by
some
other
deplorable
accident
others
affect
fits
others
affect
pregnancy
and
destitution
others
obtain
alms
by
the
husband
remaining
at
home
and
affecting
indisposition
in
case
any
one
should
visit
his
lodgings
to
examine
into
the
merits
of
the
case
whilst
the
wife
goes
out
begging
for
wine
rags
clothes
for
the
sham
invalid
others
pretend
to
have
bad
wounds
and
beg
for
linen
rags
and
small
bottles
to
contain
medicine
necessary
for
their
cure
i
saw
a
man
who
got
in
one
day
by
this
means
thirteen
pounds
weight
of
white
rags
and
more
than
five
dozen
of
phial
bottles
rags
and
bottles
sell
well
others
affect
to
have
children
confined
with
scarlet
fever
c
and
beg
for

state
that
they
have
obtained
a
note
to
take
their
children

an
infirmary
or
to
an
hospital
and
want
a
few
clothes
and
a
little
money
deaf
and
dumb
i
have
known
many
persons
of
both
sexes
who
have
acted
as
if
deaf
and
dumb
and
by
this
means
succeeded
very
well
in
obtaining
money
food
many
of
them
pretend
to
tell
fortunes
and
frequently
get
something
considerable
by
such
practices
they
carry
a
slate
and
pencil
with
them
to
write
questions
and
answers
it
would
appear
from
the
pamphlet
before
us
that
sometimes
these
deaf
and
dumb
lurkers
affect
even
in
the
to
be
thus
afflicted
but
in
such
cases
they
are
generally
found
out
by
their
fellow
vagrants

there
are
considerable
numbers
who
go
on
the
servants
lurk
or
as
servants
out
of
place
and
both
males
and
females
frequently
succeed
well
in
imposing
on
servants
and
others
by
false
statements
and
tales
of
distress
the
greater
part
of
those
who
go
on
this
lurk
are
neatly
dressed
and
have
exactly
the
appearance
of

gentlemen
families
many
of
them
have
the
which
as
it
contains
a
list
of
the
nobility
and
gentry
enables
them
to
do
the
thing
completely
this
is
followed
by
thousands
who
were
never
in
a
and
numbers
of
such
are
daily
imposing
upon
the
public
as
colliers
out
of
employ
they
generally
say
they
have
been
thrown
out
of
work
by
some
accident
such
as
the
flooding
of
the
works
or
the
falling
in
of
the
pit
they
often
go
in
parties
from
two
to
seven
or
eight
others
have
printed
papers
which
are
left
at
each
house
and
called
for
again
in
a
few
hours
others
have
written
statements
of
the
pretended
masters
of
the
accidents
and
the
supposed
signatures
of
the
works
are
affixed
to
them
some
of

then

who
go
on

themselves
as

they
like

have
false

are
printed

the
sums
raised
by
these
descriptions

be
immense

have
reduced
them

coves
are
begging
through
the
country
as
shipwrecked
sailors
they
generally
choose
winter
and
always
go
nearly
naked
their
object
in
doing
so
is
to
obtain
clothes
they
have
a
long
pitiful
tale
of
pretended
distress
which
they
shout
through
the
streets
of
having
been
shipwrecked

generally
go

often
obtain
a
great
deal
of

are
females
who
like
the
shallow
coves
go
nearly
naked
they
also
adopt
that
mode
of

only
ask

a
profitable
occupation
in

a

of
this

generally
gets
many
shillings
in
the
course
of
the
clay
cadging
on
the
downright
from
door
to
door
is
like
all
other
trades
getting
worse
but
still
thousands
do
very
well
at
it
and
frequently
get
more
food
than
they
can
consume
i
have
often
seen
food
which
many
working
people
would
gladly
have
eaten
shamefully
and
wantonly
wasted
children
kiddies
so
well
instructed
in
the
arts
of
imposition
by
their
parents
that
they
frequently
obtain
more
in

than
cadgers

are
many
cadgers
who
write
short
sentences
with
chalk
on
the
flags
and
some
of
them
can
do
it
remarkably
well
these
are
called
i
have
seen
the
following
sentences
frequently
written
by
them
in
places
where
there
were
numbers
passing
by
and
where
they
thought
it
would
be
likely
to
get

in

this
often
proves
a
very
profitable
method
some
of
them
affect
blindness
whilst
others
represent
themselves
as
unable

follow
any
employment
in
consequence
of
being
subject
to
fits
some
cadgers
save
very
considerable
sums
of
money

these
are
very
few

with
the
great
number
who
live
by
this
trade
of

depend
upon

cadge

well

as
a

for

never

them
at
any
house
where
they
expect
to
get
more
without
them
as
well
as
all

we
take
the
following
extract
the
wildness
into
which
some
of
these
children
in
the
more
solitary
parts
of
the
country
grow
recollect
this
is
in
lancashire
near
the
great
city
of
manchester
is
i
imagine
not
to
be
surpassed
in
any
of
the
back
settlements
of
america
on
the
july
the
day
of
that
remarkable
which
visited
a
great
part
of
the
kingdom
with
much
fury
being
driven
into
a
cottage
at
the
foot
of
pendle
by
the
coming
on
of
this
storm
and
while
standing
at
the
door
watching
its
progress
i
observed
the
head
of
some
human
creature
carefully
protruded
from
the
doorway
of
an
adjacent
shed
and
as
suddenly
withdrawn
on
being
observed
to
ascertain
what
sort
of
a
person
it
belonged
to
i
went
into
the
shed
but
at
first
found
it
too
dark
to
enable
me
to
discover
anything
presently
however
as
objects
became
visible
i
saw
a
little
creature
apparently
a
girl
about
ten
years
old
reared
very
erectly
against
the
opposite
wall
on
accosting
her
in
a
kind
tone
and
telling
her
to
come
forward
and
not
be
afraid
she
advanced
from
the
wall
and
behold
there
stood
another
little
creature
about
the
head
shorter
whom
she
had
been
concealing
i
asked
the
elder
child
whether
this
younger
one
were
a
girl
she
answered
it
a
boy
neither
boy
nor
girl
was
she
a
girl
herself
was
it
a
boy
i
was
speaking
to
in
the
name
of
wonder
were
they
then
are
childer
and
was
the
woman
in
the
house
their
mother
was
she
then
mam
your
mam
and
do
you
keep
cows
in
this
shed
in
short
common
english
was
quite
unintelligible
to
these
poor
little
creatures
and
their
appearance
was
as
wild
as
their
speech
they
were
two
fine
young
creatures
nevertheless
especially
the
elder
whose
form
and
face
were
full
of
that
symmetry
and
fine
grace
that
are
sometimes
the
growth
of
unrestrained
nature
and
would
have
delighted
the
sculptor
or
painter

only
clothing
was
a
sort
of
little
boddice
with
skirts
made
of
a
reddish
stuff
and
rendered
more
picturesque
by
sundry
patches
of
scarlet
cloth
no
doubt
from
their
mother
old
cloak
their
heads
bosoms
and
legs
to
the
knees
were
bare
to
all
the
influences
of
earth
and
heaven
and
on
giving
each
of
them
a
penny
they
bounded
off
with
the
fleetness
and
elasticity
of
young
roes
no
doubt
the
hills
and
the
heaths
the
wild
flowers
of
summer
and
the
swift
waters
of
the
glens
were
the
only
live
long
day
companions
of
these
children
who
came
home
only
to
their
oatmeal
dinner
and
a
bed
as
simple
as
their
garments
imagine
the
violent
change
of
life
by
sudden
capture
and
confinement
of
these
little
english
savages
in
the
noise
labor
and
foul
atmosphere
of
the
cotton
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
towns
many
of
the
swelling
ranges
of
hills
present
a
much
more
cultivated
aspect
and
delight
the
eye
with
their
smooth
green
and
flowing
outlines
and
the
valleys
almost
everywhere
are
woody
watered
with
clear
rapid
streams
and
in
short
are
beautiful
but
along
the
rise
of
the
tall
chimneys
of
vast
and
innumerable
factories
and
even
while
looking
on
the
places
of
the
master
manufactories
with
their
woods
and
gardens
and
shrubbery
lawns
around
them
can
not
help
thinking
of
the
horrors
detailed
before
the
committee
of
the
house
of
commons
respecting
the
factory
of
the
parentless
and
friendless
wretches
sent
by
wagon
loads
from
distant
to
these
prisons
of
labor
and
despair
of
the
young
frames
crushed
to
the
dust
by
incessant
labor
of
the
beds
into
which
one
set
of
children
got
as
another
set
got
out
so
that
they
were
said
never
to
be
cold
the
whole
year
round
till
contagious
fires
burnt
out
and
swept
away
by
hundreds
these
little
victims
of
mammon
wheel
beautiful
as
are
many
of
these
wild
recesses
where
before
the
introduction
of
steam
the
dashing
rivulet
invited
the
to
erect
their
mills
and
curious
as
the
remains
of
those
simple
original
factories
are
with
their
one
great
which
turned
their
spindles
while
there
was
water
but
during
the
drought
of
summer
quite
as
often
stood
still
yet
one
is
haunted
even
there
among
the
shadows
of
the
fine
old
trees
that
throw
their
arms
athwart
streams
dashing
down
their
beds
of
solid
rock
by
the
memory
of
little
tender
children
that
never
knew
pity
or
kindness
but
labored
on
and
on
through
noon
and
through
midnight
till
they
slept
and
yet
mechanically
worked
and
were
often
awaked
only
by
the
horrid
machinery
rending
off
their
limbs
in
places
like
these
where
now
the
old
factories
and
large
houses
of
the
proprietors
stand
deserted
or
are
inhabited
by
troops
of
poor
creatures
whose
poverty
only
makes
them
appear
the
more
desolate
we
are
told
by
such
men
as
fielden
of
oldham
once
a
factory
child
himself
and
now
a
great
manufacturer
who
dares
to
reveal
the
secrets
of
the
that
little
children
have
even
committed
suicide
to
escape
from
a
life
worse
than
ten
deaths
and
what
a
mighty
system
is
this
now
become
what
a
perpetual
and
vast
supply
of
human
energy
and
human
life
it
requires
with
all
the
facilities
of
improved
machinery
with
all
the
developed
power
of
steam
and
with
all
the
glowing
thirst
of
wealth
to
urge
it
on
we
are
told
that
the
state
of
the
factories
is
improved
and
i
trust
they
are
but
if
there
be
any
truth
in
the
evidence
given
before
the
parliamentary
committees
there
is
need
of
great
amelioration
yet
and
it
is
when
we
recollect
these
things
how
completely
the
laboring
class
has
in
these
districts
been
regarded
as
mere
machinery
for
the
accumulation
of
enormous
capitals
that
we
cease
to
wonder
at
their
uncouth
and
degraded
aspect
and
at
the
neglect
in
which
they
are
suffered
to
swarm
over
these
hills
like
the
very
weeds
of
humanity
cast
out
into
disregarded
places
and
left
to
spread
and
increase
in
rank
and
deleterious
luxuriance
what
is
so
poetically
and
graphically
described
by
hewitt
is
verified
in
its
minutest
details

the
glory
and
shame

from

we
having
nothing
to
remark
except
as
to
the
line
from
the
french
song
which
has
taken
the
place
of
the
marseilloise
as
the
great
national
song
we
should
rather
say
national
dirge
it
is
the
maddening
cry
of
hunger
for
employment
and
bread
and
more
resembles
the
howl
of
the
wolves
of
the
pyrennes
as
they
start
in
quest
of
prey
than
the
anthem
of

it
truly
represents
embodies

us
give
the

of

the

its

their

at
the

of

human

has
at
last
found
tongues
and

to
make
itself
heard
and
felt
it
appeals
to
our
feelings
and
our
understandings
to
our
sympathies
and
fears
its
wails
melt
us
to
pity
its
ravings
terrify
us
its
woes
sicken
us
it
will
no
longer
hide
itself
we
must
either
remove
it
or
submit
to
have
it
constantly
exposed
to
our
gaze
in
all
its
horrid
deformity
hitherto
the
comfortable
classes
have
virtually
answered
the
bitter
complaints
of
the
uncomfortable
classes
in
some
such
terms
as
these
people
we
are
very
sorry
for
your
suffering
we
really
feel
for
you
take
this
trifle
it
will
be
some
relief
we
wish
we
could
do
more
and
now
pray
be
quiet
do
distress
us
with
your
writhings
and
agonies
resign
yourselves
to
the
will
of
providence
and
bear
hunger
and
cold
in
peace
and
seclusion
above
all
attempt
no
violence
or
we
must
use
violence
to
keep
you
quiet
the
answer
of
the
uncomfortable
classes
to
such
admonitions
day
by
day
becoming
more
unmistakable
is
us
relieve
us
make
us
comfortable
or
show
us
how
we
may
make
ourselves
comfortable
otherwise
we
must
make
you
uncomfortable
we
will
be
comfortable

in

we
ventured
to
offer
a
few
indications
as
to
what
we
considered
a
part
an
important
part
of
the
remedial
measures
to
be
resorted
to
for
the
prevention
of
human
misery
we
were
then
dealing
with
that
question
as
a
whole
we
now
propose
to
address
ourselves
to
miseries
of
a
class
the
sufferings
of
the
distressed
have
obtained
an
infamous
notoriety
they
are
a
scandal
to
our
age
and
a
reproach
to
our
boasted
civilization
they
have
been
clothed

full
of
pathos

free
from
exaggeration

draws
quite
as
clear
a
picture
of
the

points
out
the
only
feasible
remedy
for
the
evils
of
that
condition
slavery
the
only
remedy

of

whoever
is
unprepared
to
cast
aside
not
only
his
prejudices
but
many
of
what
may
be
considered
opinions
had
better
not
attempt
to
peruse
the
following
few
pages
i
must
demand
of
my
reader
that
he
come
to
the
perusal
the
of
a
juryman
no
information
that
he
has
gained
elsewhere
no
feelings
that
he
has
cherished
as
virtues
no
sentiments
that
he
has
cultivated
as
noble
and
no
opinions
that
he
may
have
formed
as
infallible
must
interfere
with
his
purely
and
simply
receiving
the
following
arguments
on
their
own
cogency
and
truth
alone
the
writer
considers
he
has
made
a
great
discovery
in
moral
and
political
science
and
elevated
by
his
subject
above
all
personal
influences
he
commits
it
to
be
worked
out
by
others
without
the
ostentation
of
recording
his
name
or
deeming
that
the
applause
of
present
or
of
future
generations
can
add
to
his
sublime
delight
in
discovering
and
applying
a
panacea
to
the
varied
and
bitter
ills
that
beset
of
the
poor
inhabitants
of
the
kingdom
as
some
account
of
the
means
by
which
a
great
discovery
has
been
arrived
at
is
necessary
in
order
to
prepare
the
mind
for
its
reception
with
due
respect
i
shall
give
a
brief
outline
of
the
process
by
which
this
truth
was
elicited
born
with
natural
sensibilities
i
early
learnt
to
shrink
from
pain
endured
by
others
as
if
felt
actually
and
bodily
by
myself
thus
constituted
what
a
scene
was
displayed
to
me
when
i
came
into
the
great
and
moving
society
of
mankind
what
mighty
heaps
of
misery
did
i
discern
what
details
did
the
records
of
the
various
courts
of
justice
disclose
what
regions
of
squalor
misery
and
degradation
did
my
travels
reveal
to
me
in
every
city
and
every
hamlet
i
visited
the
bent
of
my
future
avocation
was
soon
fixed
and
i
became
a
philanthropist
by
profession
not
to
make
a
trade
of
it
at
monster
meetings
or
fancy
fairs
but
as
a
pursuit
to
which
i
felt
myself
called
by
a
spiritual
voice
as
distinct
i
should
say
as
that
which
ever
called
a
theologian
from
a
curacy
of
fifty
pounds
a
year
to
a
bishopric
of
twenty
thousand
it
is
not
necessary
to
recapitulate
the
horrors
i
have
witnessed
in
the
regions
of
poverty
it
is
said
that
the
eras
of
pestilence
and
famine
are
passed
but
so
will
not
those
say
who
have
visited
the
dwellings
of
the
operatives
of
our
great
manufacturing
towns
when
the
markets
are
glutted
and
the
mills
and
manufactories
are
closed
pestilence
still
rages
fiercely
as
ever
in
the
form
of
typhus
engendered
by
want
in
the
mission
i
have
called
myself
to
i
have
stood
upon
the
mud
floor
over
the
corpse
of
the
mother
and
the
child
both
the
victims
of
want
i
have
seen
a
man
god
image
stretched
on
straw
wrapped
only
in
a
mat
resign
his
breath
from
starvation
in
the
prime
of
age
i
have
entered
on
a
sultry
summer
night
a
small
house
situate
on
the
banks
of
a
common
sewer
wherein
one
hundred
and
human
beings
of
both
sexes
and
all
ages
were
indiscriminately
crowded
i
have
been
in
the
pestilential
hovels
of
our
great
manufacturing
cities
where
life
was
corrupted
in
every
possible
mode
from
the
malaria
of
the
sewer
to
the
poison
of
the
i
have
been
in
sheds
of
the
peasant
worse
than
the
hovel
of
the
russian
where
eight
squalid
dirty
boorish
creatures
were
to
be
kept
alive
by
eight
shillings
per
week
irregularly
paid
i
have
seen
the
humanities
of
life
desecrated
in
every
way
i
have
seen
the
father
snatch
the
bread
from
his
child
and
the
mother
offer
the
for
the
breast
i
have
seen
too
generous
sacrifices
and
tender
considerations
to
which
the
boasted
chivalries
of
sydney
and
edward
were
childish
ostentation
i
have
found
wrong
so
exalted
and
right
so
debased
i
have
seen
and
known
of
so
much
misery
that
the
faith
in
good
has
shivered
within
me
for
a
time
when
i
urged
these
things
in
the
circles
of
the
comfortable
i
received
many
various
replies
by
some
it
was
said
that
it
was
the
lot
of
humanity
that
it
had
always
been
so
and
therefore
always
must
that
to
enlarge
on
the
evil
was
only
to
create
discontent
and
so
injure
the
better
classes
it
was
in
vain
i
urged
to
these
reasoners
that
for
hundreds
and
perhaps
thousands
of
years
creatures
little
better
than
calibans
infested
the
morasses
and
forests
of
europe
that
civilization
had
an
onward
progress
and
that
the
history
of
the
world
proved
the
one
great
truth
that
man
is
the
creature
of
circumstances
by
some
the
evils
were
denied
by
some
few
deplored
by
all
the
discussion
was
avoided
though
the
destruction
that
menaced
the
roman
empire
from
the
invasion
of
the
barbarian
world
was
never
so
imminent
nor
could
the
consequence
be
so
dreadful
as
that
which
the
wealthy
and
civilization
itself
would
sustain
from
the
insurrection
of
outraged
poverty
i
next
tried
the
politicians
i
devoted
some
years
to
history
and
political
economy
i
even
entered
the
senate
in
politics
i
found
no
means
of
relief
the
struggle
there
was
for
the
preponderance
in
power
and
the
reply
help
us
to
get
into
power
and
then
we
will
see
what
we
can
do
the
utmost
was
to
institute
inquiries
and
from
the
information
thus
gathered
has
been
collected
a
record
of
misery
such
as
never
was
before
displayed
it
is
true
some
steps
have
at
last
been
taken
in
the
right
direction
some
few
noble
spirits
have
spoken
out
to
the
comfortable
the
dreadful
truths
that
something
must
be
done
is
now
acknowledged
by
all
who
think
the
foolish
the
careless
and
the
truculent
can
no
longer
avowedly
declare
the
cries
and
groans
of
the
miserable
multitude
to
be
seditious
discontent
nor
ascribe
their
sufferings
to
the
results
of
retributive
justice
baffled
in
every
search
for
a
remedy
at
home
i
determined
to
search
foreign
nations
and
having
carefully
journeyed
through
europe
i
sought
successively
the
east
and
west
until
i
had
traversed
the
civilized
countries
of
the
world
it
was
in
the
remote
regions
of
the
east
and
west
that
i
found
a
clue
to
my
discovery
i
here
found
mankind
as
multitudinous
as
at
home
but
much
more
happy
starvation
except
in
cases
of
general
famine
was
unknown
and
on
the
contrary
i
heard
the
sounds
of
revelry
and
dancing
of
mirth
and
leisure
amongst
the
lowest
classes
how
different
to
the
everlasting
toil
of
the
superior
englishman
these
then
i
said
are
the
concomitants
of
bondage
having
thus
struck
out
the
idea
i
followed
it
up
with
logical
severity
and
enunciated
the
truth
that
and
content
and
liberty
and
discontent
are
natural
results
of
each
applying
this
then
to
the
pauperized
population
of
england
i
found
that
the
only
way
to
permanently
and
efficiently
remedy
the
complicated
evils
would
be
to
enslave
whole
of
the
people
of
england
who
have
not
of
course
i
expect
a
shout
of
execration
and
contempt
at
such
a
bold
proposition
but
as
i
have
already
said
i
seek
only
to
gain
the
hearing
at
first
of
the
impartial
and
the
original
thinker
that
i
am
disinterested
will
at
once
be
allowed
when
i
declare
i
do
not
seek
to
be
one
of
the
enslaved
but
let
us
proceed
to
examine
how
this
mighty
benefit
would
manifest
itself
the
first
great
advantage
would
be
that
the
lower
classes
of
society
would
be
placed
on
an
equality
with
the
domestic
animals
and
by
becoming
property
become
valuable
and
valued
at
present
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
a
horse
that
is
worth
fifty
pounds
is
much
more
cared
for
than
a
man
who
is
worth
nothing
we
have
lately
seen
a
case
where
a
woman
was
allowed
to
expire
in
parturition
because
no
more
than
eight
shillings
was
allowed
for
the
midwife
fee
whereas
when
a
famous
racing
mare
foaled
ten
guineas
were
not
thought
too
great
a
sum
to
secure
the
attendance
of
a
veterinary
surgeon
now
had
the
woman
been
a
slave
her
offspring
would
have
been
worth
something
and
of
course
her
safety
secured
like
all
great
discoveries
the
ramifications
of
the
advantages
are
found
to
be
endless
and
if
once
fully
entertained
would
be
irresistible
entire
and
complete
slavery
of
the
poor
would
put
an
end
to
all
the
discussions
of
their
rights
and
clearly
and
definitely
work
out
the
relative
duties
of
all
classes
we
should
have
no
more
occasion
for
vague
special
pleading
such
as
we
find
in
paley
and
other
moral
philosophers
who
endeavor
to
reconcile
dependence
and
independence
and
liberty
and
obedience
sedition
would
be
at
once
annihilated
for
where
there
was
no
hope
nor
recognition
of
equality
there
would
be
no
attempt
to
raise
claims
which
were
stifled
before
born
all
vain
ambition
such
as
that
now
subsisting
between
the
potboy
and
the
peer
as
manifested
in
chesterfield
mosaic
gold
and
cigars
would
be
prevented
the
potboy
would
be
a
contented
slave
and
the
peer
left
to
his
superiority
in
clothes
trinkets
and
sensualities
it
will
of
course
be
asserted
that
the
people
would
not
be
contented
as
slaves
but
it
is
only
to
make
a
state
inevitable
and
humanity
is
soon
reconciled
to
it
as
we
are
to
death
governments
and
the
besides
what
is
liberty
a
word
now
almost
forgotten
a
battle
sound
used
to
juggle
men
in
every
age
and
country
in
greece
rome
and
america
the
of
slaves
to
fight
for
the
liberty
of
slavery
must
we
then
ever
remain
the
tools
of
words
reject
all
the
true
advantages
of
slavery
because
we
can
not
bear
the
name
and
take
all
its
evils
and
more
because
we
wish
to
renounce
the
sound
what
are
soldiers
and
sailors
but
bondsmen
indeed
they
are
a
happy
specimen
of
slavery
well
fed
clad
and
tended
with
plenty
of
leisure
and
repose
why
then
should
they
be
happier
than
the
peasant
who
pines
away
his
dreary
existence
on
bread
and
potatoes
and
water
what
is
the
convict
but
a
slave
who
by
his
crimes
has
earned
his
right
to
be
kept
well
and
safe
from
the
elements
and
want
we
reward
the
criminal
with
slavery
and
competence
and
leave
the
honest
man
to
liberty
and
want
if
indeed
the
old
noble
cry
of
liberty
could
be
realized
then
it
were
vain
to
urge
my
discovery
but
as
englishmen
in
proportion
as
they
have
gained
their
liberty
have
lost
their
beer
it
behooves
us
to
see
whether
they
had
not
better
hasten
back
to
that
state
when
inventoried
with
their
masters
swine
they
shared
also
their
superfluities
chapter
xvii
the
edinburgh
review
on
southern
slavery
the
edinburgh
review
well
knows
that
the
white
laborers
of
england
receive
more
blows
than
are
inflicted
on
southern
slaves
in
the
navy
the
army
and
the
merchant
service
of
england
there
is
more
of
cruelty
more
physical
discomfort
than
on
all
the
farms
of
the
south
this
review
for
twenty
years
has
been
a
grand
repository
of
the
ignorance
the
crimes
and
sufferings
of
the
workers
in
mines
and
factories
of
the
agricultural
laborers
of
the
apprentices
and
in
fine
of
the
whole
laboring
class
of
england
we
might
appeal
to
its
pages
almost
to
establish
these
facts
half
the
time
of
parliament
is
consumed
in
vain
efforts
to
alleviate
the
condition
of
the
and
starving
poor
and
much
of
this
review
is
taken
up
in
chronicling
the
humane
but
fruitless
action
of
parliament
no
man
in
the
south
we
are
sure
ever
bred
slaves
for
sale
they
are
always
sold
reluctantly
and
generally
from
necessity
or
as
a
punishment
for
misconduct
the
has
been
settled
in
great
part
by
farmers
from
the
older
slave
states
removing
to
them
with
their
negroes
the
breaking
up
of
families
of
whites
and
of
blacks
keeps
equal
pace
but
we
have
no
law
of
impressment
in
the
south
to
sever
the
family
ties
of
either
blacks
or
whites
nor
have
we
any
slavery
half
so
cruel
as
that
to
which
the
impressed
english
seaman
is
subjected
the
soldiers
torn
from
their
wives
and
children
to
suffer
and
to
perish
in
every
clime
and
on
every
sea
excite
not
the
sympathies
of
the
reviewer
they
are
all
reserved
for
imaginary
cases
of
distress
occasioned
by
the
breaking
up
of
families
of
southern
negroes
the
slave
trade
of
the
south
is
no
evil
because
the
instances
of
the
improper
severing
of
family
ties
are
rare
will
some
yankee
or
englishman
ere
the
charge
is
repeated
that
slaves
are
bred
to
be
sold
like
horses
when
they
are
old
enough
for
market
point
out
a
single
instance
in
the
present
or
the
past
of
a
southerner
pursuing
such
a
business
yankees
and
englishmen
kill
their
wives
annually
yet
it
has
not
occurred
to
englishmen
at
all
and
not
to
the
yankee
till
very
lately
to
abolish
the
marriage
relation
when
englishmen
correct
the
thousand
real
and
pressing
evils
in
their
society
it
will
be
time
enough
to
call
on
us
to
do
away
with
the
imaginary
abuses
of
slavery
these
remarks
have
been
elicited
from
us
by
an
article
on
southern
slavery
in
the
april
number
of
the
edinburgh
review
which
is
equally
distinguished
for
the
falsity
of
its
charges
and
the
ill
nature
of
its
comments
as
a
full
justification
for
the
indefinite
continuance
of
negro
slavery
we
give
below
an
extract
from
an
able
article
from
the
same
review
in
its
january
number
entitled
legislation
for
the
working
classes
in
showing
the
many
evils
arising
from
emancipating
the
whites
the
reviewer
demonstrates
though
not
intending
it
the
absurdity
of
emancipating
negroes
if
irishmen
who
are
as
intellectual
a
race
of
men
as
any
in
all
europe
have
lost
infinitely
in
physical
comfort
and
gained
nothing
in
morals
or
in
mind
by
liberty
what
will
it
avail
negroes
let
hayti
and
jamaica
answer
but
frenchmen
scotchmen
and
englishmen
we
mean
the
masses
the
proletariat
have
lost
as
much
by
emancipation
as
irishmen
history
and
statistics
the
jails
the
gallows
and
the
tell
the
same
sad
tale
everywhere
we
would
be
willing
if
necessary
to
rest
the
complete
justification
of
negro
slavery
on
this
single
extract
from
the
edinburgh
review
the
moral
and
domestic
feelings
of
the
slave
are
sacrificed
and
his
intellect
is
stunted
but
in
respect
of
his
physical
condition
he
may
be
a
gainer
it
is
necessary
says
aristotle
in
his
celebrated
justification
of
slavery
that
those
who
can
not
exist
separately
should
live
together
he
who
is
capable
of
foreseeing
by
his
intellect
is
naturally
a
master
he
who
is
able
to
execute
with
his
body
what
another
contrives
is
naturally
a
slave
wherefore
the
interest
of
the
master
and
slave
is
one
there
is
a
certain
degree
of
force
in
this
argument
if
it
is
limited
to
the
economical
relations
of
the
two
parties
it
is
the
interest
of
the
master
to
maintain
his
slave
in
good
working
order
in
general
therefore
he
is
comparatively
well
fed
clothed
and
lodged
his
physical
wants
are
provided
for
his
food
descends
into
his
mouth
like
the
manna
in
the
wilderness
he
is
clothed
like
the
lilies
of
the
field
he
has
no
thought
or
care
for
the
morrow
although
complaints
were
made
of
insufficient
food
and
overwork
the
arguments
against
negro
slavery
in
our
west
india
colonies
were
founded
mainly
on
the
necessity
of
constant
punishment
on
the
as
it
was
called
and
the
cruelty
of
the
inflictions
the
report
of
the
french
commission
framed
by
the
due
de
broglie
which
recommended
the
gradual
abolition
of
slavery
likewise
bears
testimony
to
the
excellent
physical
condition
of
the
slaves
in
the
french
colonies
it
is
on
account
of
the
advantages
which
may
belong
to
dependence
upon
a
wealthy
lord
as
compared
with
a
needy
independence
that
the
slave
in
menander
exclaims
that
it
is
better
to
obtain
a
good
master
than
to
live
meanly
and
wretchedly
as
a
freeman
so
the
rhetorician
libanus
who
lived
in
the
fourth
century
in
a
declamation
entitled
a
of
after
having
enumerated
the
privations
and
sufferings
which
fall
to
the
lot
of
the
poor
freeman
proceeds
thus
none
of
these
evils
belong
to
slavery
the
slave
sleeps
at
his
ease
being
fed
by
the
cares
of
his
master
and
supplied
with
all
the
other
things
needful
for
his
body
but
the
poor
freeman
is
constantly
awake
seeking
the
means
of
subsistence
and
subjected
to
the
severe
dominion
of
want
which
compels
him
to
hunger
the
author
of
describes
the
astonishment
of
the
vizier
of
the
shah
of
persia
on
hearing
from
the
british
ambassador
that
there
is
no
slavery
in
england
and
that
the
king
is
using
his
influence
to
put
it
down
in
other
states
indeed
said
the
vizier
you
surely
can
not
be
so
cruel
what
would
become
of
the
poor
slaves
if
they
were
free
nothing
can
be
happier
than
the
lot
of
ours
but
if
they
were
abandoned
to
their
fate
they
would
starve
and
die
they
are
our
children
and
form
a
part
of
our
family
a
similar
feeling
is
described
by
kohl
as
existing
among
the
serfs
in
the
baltic
provinces
of
russia
with
respect
to
their
recent
emancipation
the
serf
is
now
no
longer
but
it
is
not
difficult
for
his
lord
to
find
the
means
of
detaining
him
on
the
estate
if
he
wishes
so
to
do
kohl
continue
thus
though
the
right
which
the
peasant
has
thus
obtained
is
so
frequently
useless
to
him
the
counter
right
of
his
master
of
banishing
him
from
his
native
place
is
very
often
turned
against
him
formerly
a
noble
could
not
by
any
means
get
rid
of
his
serfs
and
whenever
they
were
in
want
he
was
forced
to
support
and
maintain
them
at
present
the
moment
a
peasant
becomes
useless
and
burdensome
it
is
easy
to
dismiss
him
on
account
of
which
the
serfs
in
some
parts
of
the
provinces
would
not
accept
of
the
emancipation
offered
and
bitterly
lamented
the
freedom
as
it
was
called
which
was
forced
upon
them
the
serf
often
mournfully
complains
that
he
has
lost
a
father
and
kept
a
master
and
his
lord
now
often
refuses
the
little
requests
of
his
peasants
saying
know
you
are
not
my
children
now
a
similar
state
of
feeling
is
likewise
reported
to
exist
among
the
serfs
of
russia
proper
who
in
many
cases
prefer
the
certainty
of
slavery
to
the
risks
of
emancipation
featherstonhaugh
in
his
in
the
slave
states
of
north
america
relates
that
madison
the
informed
him
that
he
had
once
assembled
all
his
numerous
slaves
and
offered
to
manumit
them
immediately
but
they
instantly
declined
it
alleging
that
they
had
been
born
on
his
estate
had
always
been
provided
for
by
him
with
raiment
and
food
in
sickness
and
in
health
and
if
they
were
made
free
they
would
have
no
home
to
go
to
and
no
friend
to
protect
and
care
for
them
they
preferred
therefore
to
live
and
die
as
his
slaves
who
had
always
been
a
kind
master
to
them
slavery
excludes
the
principle
of
competition
which
reduces
the
wages
of
the
free
laborer
increases
his
hours
of
work
and
sometimes
deprives
him
of
all
means
of
subsistence
the
maintenance
of
slaves
as
one
household
or
likewise
conduces
to
thrift
their
supply
on
a
large
scale
is
or
ought
to
be
less
expensive
than
when
each
laborer
as
in
a
state
of
freedom
has
a
separate
cottage
and
a
family
of
his
own
with
slaves
thus
supported
there
is
no
more
waste
than
with
horses
or
cattle
there
is
none
of
the
loss
or
damage
which
arises
from
the
drunkenness
and
improvidence
of
the
free
laborer
expending
his
own
wages
again
the
can
regulate
the
number
of
his
workmen
and
can
in
this
manner
control
the
amount
of
population
the
means
may
doubtless
be
harsh
and
cruel
but
they
are
effective
for
their
end
in
general
indeed
slave
classes
show
a
disposition
to
diminish
rather
than
increase
in
number
and
where
the
slave
trade
has
not
been
prohibited
the
number
is
kept
up
rather
by
new
importation
than
by
births
hence
the
evils
of
an
abundant
population
never
manifested
themselves
while
the
mass
of
the
people
was
in
a
servile
and
state
moreover
it
can
scarcely
be
doubted
that
under
certain
circumstances
industry
may
be
promoted
and
the
produce
of
the
land
increased
by
the
existence
of
a
slave
class
indeed
thinks
that
the
tropical
countries
can
never
be
effectually
cultivated
by
free
labor
were
the
slaves
completely
emancipated
in
the
united
states
cuba
and
brazil
says
he
it
is
all
but
certain
that
the
culture
of
sugar
and
cotton
would
be
as
completely
abandoned
in
them
as
in
hayti
and
if
the
change
were
accompanied
by
a
considerable
improvement
in
the
condition
of
the
black
population
the
sacrifice
might
not
perhaps
be
deemed
too
great
but
where
is
the
ground
for
supposing
that
such
would
be
the
case
indeed
the
fair
presumption
seems
to
be
the
other
way
little
at
all
events
would
be
gained
by
turning
a
laborious
slave
into
an
idle
improvident
and
perhaps
beggarly
freeman
if
we
look
merely
to
the
present
and
confine
our
views
to
results
arguments
certainly
appear
strong
and
although
it
is
true
that
all
hope
of
improvement
in
respect
of
his
physical
condition
is
denied
to
the
slave
yet
it
must
be
admitted
that
practically
and
looking
to
the
actual
generation
the
absence
of
a
power
of
rising
in
the
world
is
no
severe
privation
to
a
peasant
class
neither
in
england
among
the
agricultural
laborers
nor
in
the
continental
states
among
the
small
proprietors
are
there
many
instances
of
a
person
quitting
the
condition
in
which
he
is
born
nor
is
any
slavery
so
indellible
where
the
slaves
have
the
same
colored
skin
as
their
masters
as
to
prevent
frequent
emancipations
of
individual
slaves
from
personal
affection
and
other
causes
the
freedmen
formed
a
numerous
class
among
the
romans
and
it
is
known
to
what
important
posts
slaves
have
risen
in
the
turkish
empire
after
these
remarks
the
intention
of
which
can
not
be
misunderstood
by
any
reader
of
this
journal
we
can
better
estimate
the
effects
of
the
change
from
slavery
to
personal
freedom
upon
the
emancipated
slave
he
is
relieved
from
the
liabilities
and
burdens
but
he
at
the
same
time
forfeits
the
advantages
of
slavery
while
the
slave
is
exonerated
from
his
legal
obligations
to
his
master
the
master
is
exonerated
from
his
legal
and
moral
obligations
towards
his
slave
and
his
interest
in
the
conservation
and
protection
of
his
slave
is
at
an
end
the
slave
to
use
the
common
phrase
becomes
his
own
master
with
the
acquisition
of
this
power
he
incurs
the
obligations
of
he
becomes
independent
and
being
so
he
must
provide
for
his
is
not
an
unmixed
good
to
the
work
it
imports
onerous
duties
it
implies
the
necessity
of
providing
for
a
man
own
wants
and
those
of
his
family
the
freedman
is
no
longer
forced
by
the
fear
of
corporal
punishment
to
do
a
prescribed
task
of
work
but
he
must
work
in
order
to
earn
wages
and
what
is
more
he
must
find
work
for
himself
he
is
no
longer
incapable
of
acquiring
property
or
of
reaping
the
fruits
of
his
own
industry
but
he
is
in
consideration
of
this
power
bound
to
provide
for
his
own
support
he
is
no
longer
incapable
of
contracting
a
lawful
marriage
or
begetting
free
legitimate
children
but
he
is
bound
to
maintain
his
wife
and
children
by
his
own
exertions
and
if
he
deserts
them
or
allows
them
to
starve
he
is
subject
to
legal
punishment
he
is
no
longer
fed
and
maintained
merely
according
to
his
physical
wants
without
reference
to
the
value
of
his
services
but
on
the
other
hand
he
is
delivered
over
to
the
unchecked
operation
of
the
principle
of
competition
and
he
must
content
himself
with
the
scanty
pittance
which
the
rivalry
of
the
labor
market
may
assign
him
he
is
no
longer
treated
as
a
mere
animal
or
implement
of
production
without
feeling
mind
or
moral
character
he
does
not
follow
the
religion
of
his
master
and
he
may
voluntarily
choose
his
own
creed
but
in
becoming
a
free
moral
agent
he
accepts
the
responsibilities
of
that
condition
his
path
is
open
to
virtue
but
he
is
answerable
for
his
acts
and
their
consequences
if
he
deviates
into
other
ways
he
can
by
foresight
determine
his
own
lot
but
he
must
in
compensation
suffer
the
penalties
of
his
own
improvidence
when
we
contemplate
the
actual
results
of
the
change
in
question
and
compare
the
state
of
the
working
classes
in
countries
where
they
are
free
with
the
state
of
a
slave
class
we
find
that
the
only
benefits
of
freedom
which
have
been
fully
enjoyed
by
the
laboring
classes
are
the
ones
such
as
exemption
from
bodily
inflictions
and
other
ill
treatment
but
that
the
benefits
which
they
have
hitherto
derived
from
the
social
independence
have
been
less
prominent
the
benefits
which
are
economical
and
domestic
which
consist
in
the
acquisition
enjoyment
and
transmission
of
wealth
and
in
the
development
of
the
family
affections
are
more
remote
and
depend
on
numerous
preliminary
conditions
which
hitherto
have
rarely
in
any
community
the
entire
harvest
of
the
change
will
not
be
reaped
until
civilization
has
made
further
progress
until
the
providence
industry
intelligence
and
peaceableness
of
the
working
man
are
such
as
to
render
him
altogether
fit
for
and
to
protect
society
against
the
shocks
arising
from
his
delusions
and
violence
but
in
proportion
as
the
positive
advantages
are
distant
the
disadvantages
of
the
change
make
themselves
sensibly
felt
as
soon
as
slavery
has
ceased
to
exist
the
freedom
of
action
for
the
working
classes
is
complete
they
are
masters
of
their
own
conduct
and
their
conduct
determines
the
condition
of
the
great
mass
of
the
community
if
then
their
moral
state
is
low
and
they
are
exempt
from
all
legal
compulsion
they
are
likely
to
make
a
bad
use
of
their
liberty
whenever
the
moral
restraints
are
weak
and
the
rights
of
the
freeman
are
exercised
without
limitation
and
with
an
inward
consciousness
of
power
political
or
social
dangers
can
not
be
far
off
a
emancipated
at
once
affords
the
strongest
example
of
the
evils
arising
under
this
influence
their
moral
condition
is
at
the
best
like
that
of
children
they
have
had
no
experience
of
and
the
rights
of
freedom
are
from
their
novelty
prized
most
highly
some
countries
however
from
which
slavery
has
long
been
banished
exhibit
a
nearly
similar
state
of
things
thus
in
ireland
the
freedom
of
the
working
classes
has
produced
the
smallest
amount
of
positive
advantages
combined
with
the
largest
amount
of
disadvantages
the
peasantry
are
in
the
lowest
physical
degradation
they
derive
the
smallest
possible
quantum
of
happiness
from
their
power
of
disposing
of
themselves
and
their
families
and
of
acquiring
property
while
their
rights
of
citizenship
are
too
frequently
perverted
to
purposes
detrimental
to
themselves
and
dangerous
to
the
public
peace
when
the
slavery
of
the
working
classes
had
been
gradually
extinguished
in
western
europe
it
began
to
be
seen
that
the
theory
of
personal
freedom
could
not
be
carried
consistently
into
practical
effect
for
the
entire
community
a
man
might
in
the
eye
of
the
law
be
presumed
able
and
bound
to
maintain
himself
and
his
family
but
want
of
industry
or
intelligence
or
providence
or
the
rapine
of
the
strong
might
reduce
him
to
destitution
and
helplessness
accordingly
unless
many
of
the
laboring
class
were
to
be
permitted
to
die
of
hunger
and
neglect
it
was
necessary
to
find
some
means
of
alleviating
their
sufferings
in
further
reply
to
the
edinburgh
reviewer
and
to
illustrate
by
examples
our
theory
of
cannibals
all
or
slaves
without
masters
read
the
following
from
the
north
british
review
for
november
on
the
rural
population
of
england
have
we
not
come
upon
a
very
paradise
of
rural
seclusion
is
it
not
a
spot
to
be
chosen
by
those
who
are
intending
to
while
away
existence
among
the
never
tiring
sweets
of
a
country
life
but
let
us
step
on
a
little
way
and
overtake
the
group
of
children
that
is
just
now
crossing
the
common
alas
yet
should
we
not
refrain
from
expressing
the
sad
feelings
which
the
first
sight
of
these
infant
shadows
has
awakened
feelings
heightened
by
contrast
for
lately
we
were
making
our
way
through
a
fourth
class
street
where
the
prime
necessities
of
life
are
amply
provided
for
besides
if
we
look
a
second
time
at
these
shrunken
forms
such
is
the
beneficence
of
the
creator
we
see
that
childhood
will
have
its
smiles
its
laughs
its
gambols
under
conditions
even
the
most
forlorn
moreover
there
is
notwithstanding
that
famished
watery
look
there
is
taking
the
group
altogether
there
is
an
air
of
pure
rusticity
there
is
an
innocence
comparatively
and
a
modest
propriety
there
is
a
respectfulness
in
their
style
and
deportment
which
is
greatly
in
their
favor
when
thought
of
in
comparison
with
the
bold
unreverential
sauciness
of
the
infant
hercules
of
manufacturing
towns
but
look
at
these
unfortunates
the
infant
serfs
of
a
neglected
rural
district
look
at
them
physiologically
observe
their
lank
colorless
hair
screening
the
sunken
eye
and
trailing
upon
the
bony
neck
look
at
the
hollow
cheeks
the
arms
and
the
unmuscular
shanks
which
serve
the
young
urchins
for
legs
but
are
not
these
children
breathing
a
pure
atmosphere
are
they
not
nature
own
yes
but
there
is
one
thing
wanting
to
them
one
ominous
word
clears
up
the
mystery
starvation
not
indeed
such
starvation
as
brings
the
sorrows
of
a
sad
lot
to
a
speedy
end
but
such
as
drags
its
pining
sufferings
out
through
the
overshadowed
years
of
childhood
and
youth
through
those
spasmodic
years
of
manhood
during
which
the
struggle
to
exist
wears
an
aspect
of
rugged
rigor
and
then
through
that
residue
of
early
decrepitude
haggard
bent
which
is
indeed
an
unblessed
end
of
an
unblessed
existence
this
rural
population
does
pretty
well
if
the
father
be
and
sober
and
the
mother
managing
through
the
summer
season
of
and
wheat
harvest
that
is
to
say
when
the
labor
of
the
mother
and
her
children
comes
in
to
swell
a
little
the
weekly
wages
during
these
weeks
something
of
needed
clothing
is
obtained
rent
is
paid
up
and
a
pittance
of
animal
food
weekly
is
added
to
the
bread
and
the
tea
and
the
potato
of
the
seven
months
diet
it
would
be
doing
a
wrong
to
our
worthy
farmer
friends
and
to
the
rural
sporting
gentry
to
affirm
that
these
miserables
are
actually
dying
of
want
no
they
are
not
dying
so
as
inquests
must
be
held
before
they
may
be
buried
would
to
god
they
were
they
are
the
living
they
are
living
to
show
what
extremities
men
women
and
children
may
endure
and
yet
not
die
or
what
they
hold
to
be
worse
not
to
betake
themselves
to
the
union
but
how
do
these
same
men
women
and
children
pass
five
months
of
the
year
gladly
would
one
find
them
curled
round
like
hedgehogs
and
hybernating
in
hollow
trees
in
rabbit
burrows
lost
to
consciousness
we
should
indeed
count
it
a
miracle
if
on
a
may
morning
we
were
to
see
a
group
of
human
beings
start
up
alive
from
the
sward
along
with
the
paiglus
and
the
cowslips
but
it
is
much
less
than
a
miracle
to
see
the
people
of
a
depressed
rural
district
stepping
alive
out
of
the
winter
months
the
instances
are
extremely
rare
in
which
those
who
were
born
to
the
soil
and
destined
to
the
plow
rise
above
their
native
level
such
instances
two
three
or
five
might
be
hunted
up
if
an
agricultural
county
were
ransacked
for
the
purpose
but
the
agricultural
laborer
even
if
he
had
the
brain
and
the
ambition
requisite
and
if
otherwise
he
could
effect
it
would
seldom
bring
with
him
that
which
the
social
mass
into
which
he
might
rise
especially
needs
namely
a
fully
developed
and
robust
body
meantime
what
is
it
that
is
taking
place
in
hundreds
of
instances
and
every
day
throughout
the
entire
area
of
the
manufacturing
region
men
well
put
together
and
with
plenty
of
bone
and
nerve
and
brain
using
with
an
intense
ardor
those
opportunities
of
advancement
which
abound
in
these
spheres
of
enterprise
and
of
prosperous
achievement
such
men
are
found
to
be
making
themselves
heard
of
among
their
betters
are
seen
before
they
reconcile
themselves
to
the
wearing
of
gloves
by
rapid
advances
they
are
winning
for
themselves
a
place
in
society
a
place
which
indeed
they
well
deserve
and
there
they
are
doing
what
they
had
not
thought
of
they
are
regenerating
the
mass
within
which
they
have
been
received
we
extract
the
following
from
an
article
in
the
edinburgh
review
on
juvenile
and
female
labor
in
its
january
it
is
of
the
highest
authority
being
part
of
a
report
of
commissioners
appointed
by
parliament
and
stands
endorsed
as
well
by
the
action
of
parliament
as
by
the
authority
of
the
reviewer
our
limits
will
not
allow
us
to
go
through
all
the
employments
reported
upon
in
these
volumes
but
as
specimens
we
will
give
a
short
account
of
the
condition
of
the
people
engaged
in
coal
mines
metal
wares
and
millinery
the
number
of
children
and
young
persons
employed
in
these
mines
is
enormous
and
they
appear
to
commence
working
even
underground
at
an
earlier
age
than
is
recorded
of
any
other
occupation
except
the
commissioners
report
that
instances
occur
in
which
children
are
taken
into
these
mines
to
work
as
early
as
years
of
age
sometimes
at
five
not
unfrequently
between
six
and
seven
and
often
from
seven
to
eight
while
from
eight
to
nine
is
the
ordinary
age
at
which
their
employment
commences
that
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
persons
employed
in
these
mines
is
under
thirteen
years
of
age
and
a
still
larger
proportion
between
thirteen
and
eighteen
that
in
several
districts
female
children
begin
to
work
in
the
mines
as
early
as
males
that
the
nature
of
the
employment
which
is
assigned
to
the
youngest
children
generally
that
of
requires
that
they
should
be
in
the
pit
as
soon
as
the
work
of
the
day
commences
and
according
to
the
present
system
that
they
should
not
leave
the
pit
before
the
work
of
the
day
is
at
an
end
that
although
this
employment
scarcely
deserves
the
name
of
labor
yet
as
the
children
engaged
in
it
are
commonly
excluded
from
light
and
are
always
without
companions
it
would
were
it
not
for
the
passing
and
of
the
coal
carriages
amount
to
solitary
confinement
of
the
worst
order
that
in
some
districts
they
remain
in
solitude
and
darkness
during
the
whole
time
they
are
in
the
pit
and
according
to
their
own
account
many
of
them
never
see
the
light
of
day
for
weeks
together
during
the
greater
part
of
the
winter
season
excepting
on
those
days
in
the
week
when
work
is
not
going
on
and
on
the
sundays
that
at
different
ages
from
six
years
old
and
upwards
the
hard
work
of
pushing
and
dragging
the
carriages
of
coal
from
the
workings
to
the
main
ways
or
to
the
foot
of
the
shaft
begins
a
labor
which
all
classes
of
witnesses
concur
in
stating
requires
the
unremitting
exertion
of
all
the
physical
power
which
the
young
workers
possess
that
in
the
districts
in
which
females
are
taken
down
into
the
coal
mines
both
sexes
are
employed
together
in
precisely
the
same
kind
of
labor
and
work
for
the
same
number
of
hours
that
the
girls
and
boys
and
the
young
men
and
the
young
women
and
even
married
women
and
women
with
child
commonly
work
almost
naked
and
the
men
in
many
mines
quite
naked
and
that
all
classes
of
witnesses
bear
testimony
to
the
demoralizing
influence
of
the
employment
of
females
underground
that
in
the
east
of
scotland
a
much
larger
proportion
of
children
and
young
persons
are
employed
in
these
mines
than
in
other
districts
many
of
whom
are
girls
and
that
the
chief
part
of
their
labor
consists
in
carrying
the
coals
on
their
backs
up
steep
ladders
that
when
the
are
in
full
employment
the
regular
hours
of
work
for
children
and
young
persons
are
rarely
less
than
eleven
more
often
they
are
in
some
districts
they
are
and
in
one
district
they
are
generally
and
upwards
that
in
the
great
majority
of
these
mines
is
a
part
of
the
ordinary
system
of
labor
more
or
less
regularly
carried
on
according
to
the
demand
for
coals
and
one
which
the
whole
body
of
evidence
shows
to
act
most
injuriously
both
on
the
physical
and
moral
condition
of
the
and
more
especially
on
that
of
the
children
and
young

showing
a

a
peculiarity
which
the
medical
men
reasonably
enough
attribute
to
the

still
more
to

upwards
of

whose

testify
to
the

of

to
the
injurious
effect
which
this
ultimately
produces
on

to
cause
a

extraordinary
degree
of

speak

to
show
that

excluded
from

this
necessarily
contributes
to
the
growth

vicious
population

derived

pretend

they
send

they
begin

work
generally
about

often
earlier

the

very
irregular
generally
from
ten

thirteen

just
complaint
is

point

narrow

of
them

those
used
for
stamping
are
from
four
to
seven
feet
below
the
level
of
the
ground
these
latter
which
are
cold
and
damp
are
justly
complained
of
by
the
workers
from
defective
construction
all
these
old
shops
are
liable
to
become
hot
in
summer
and
also
at
night
when
the
gas
is
lighted
and
very
cold
in
winter
efficient
ventilation
is
a
thing
unknown
in
these
places
the
great
majority
of
the
shops
are
never
whitewashed
but
there
are
many
creditable
exceptions
to
this
statement
it
has
been
already
stated
that
although
the
whole
population
of
the
town
of
wolverhampton
and
the
neighborhood
of
all
ranks
are
engaged
in
the
different
manufactures
of
the
place
yet
that
there
are
few
manufactories
of
large
size
the
work
being
commonly
carried
on
in
small
workshops
those
workshops
are
usually
situated
at
the
backs
of
the
houses
there
being
very
few
in
the
front
of
a
street
so
that
the
places
where
the
children
and
the
great
body
of
the
operatives
are
employed
are
completely
out
of
sight
in
narrow
courts
unpaved
yards
and
blind
alleys
in
the
smaller
and
dirtier
streets
of
the
town
in
which
the
poorest
of
the
working
classes
reside
are
narrow
passages
at
intervals
of
every
eight
or
ten
houses
and
sometimes
at
every
third
or
fourth
house
these
narrow
passages
are
also
the
general
gutter
which
is
by
no
means
always
confined
to
one
side
but
often
streaming
all
over
the
passage
having
made
your
way
through
the
passage
you
find
yourself
in
a
space
varying
in
size
with
the
number
of
houses
hutches
or
hovels
it
contains
they
are
nearly
all
proportionately
crowded
out
of
this
space
there
are
other
narrow
passages
sometimes
leading
to
other
similar
hovels
the
workshops
and
houses
are
mostly
built
on
a
little
elevation
sloping
towards
the
passage

the

and

state
of
the

employed
in

described

great

of

some
conception
may
be
formed
from
the
statement
that
of
the
total
number
of
known
or
suspected
offenders
in
this
town
during
the
last
twelve
months
namely
at
least
were
under
fifteen
years
of
age
as
to
illicit
sexual
intercourse
it
seems
to
prevail
almost
universally
and
from
a
very
early
period
of
life
to
this
conclusion
witnesses
of
every
rank
give
testimony
of
the
moral
condition
of
the
youthful
population
in
the
wolverhampton
district
horne
says
together
all
i
elicited
from
various
witnesses
and
conversations
with
working
people
abroad
and
at
home
and
all
that
fell
under
my
observation
i
am
obliged
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
moral
virtues
of
the
great
majority
of
the
children
are
as
few
in
number
and
as
feeble
in
practice
as
can
well
be
conceived
of
those
who
are
born
in
a
civilized
country
surrounded
by
religious
and
educational
institutions
and
by
individuals
anxious
for
the
improvement
of
the
condition
of
the
working
classes
he
adds
of
willenhall
lower
condition
of
morals
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
term
could
not
i
think
be
found
i
do
not
mean
by
this
that
there
are
many
more
prominent
vices
among
them
but
that
moral
feelings
and
sentiments
do
not
exist
among
them
they
have
no
morals
in
all
the
sheffield
trades
employing
large
numbers
of
children
it
is
stated
that
there
is
a
much
closer
intermixture
of
the
younger
children
with
the
elder
youths
and
with
the
men
than
is
usual
in
the
cotton
woollen
and
flax
factories
and
that
the
conversations
to
which
the
children
are
compelled
to
listen
would
debase
their
minds
and
blunt
their
moral
feelings
even
if
they
had
been
carefully
and
virtuously
educated
but
that
of
course
this
result
takes
place
more
rapidly
and
completely
in
the
case
of
those
who
have
had
little
or
no
religious
culture
and
little
but
bad
example
before
their
eyes
from
their
cradle
upwards
habits
of
drinking
are
formed
at
a
very
early
age

being
generally
introduced

the
youth
of
both
sexes
are
encouraged
to
meet
and
scenes
destructive
of
every
vestige
of
virtue
or
morality
ensue
but
it
is
stated
by
all
classes
of
witnesses
that
most
revolting
feature
of
juvenile
depravity
in
this
town
is
early
contamination
from
the
association
of
the
sexes
that
prostitution
is
exceedingly
common
evidence
says
the

which
attests
the
early
commencement
of
sexual
and
promiscuous
intercourse
among

and
girls

the
neighboring
villages

number
of

the
hardness
of

render
few

needful

in

very
often
they
have
no

and
the
women

girls
have
only
a
thin
ragged
petticoat
and
an
open
shirt
without
sleeves
in
this
occupation
it
is
proved
by
unquestionable
evidence
that
it
is
for
children
to
begin
to
work
at
the
age
of
four
five
and
six
years

instances
were
found
in
which
a
child
only
years
old
was
set
to
work

the
side
of
its

work
is
of

very
slight
but
is
trying

the
eyes

in

the
statement
of
the

twelve

only
an
interval
of
a
quarter
of
an

for

cities
and

in
london
is
however
that
which
has
left
the
most
painful
impression
upon
our
minds
not
only
because
the
work

unfortunate

of

most
severe

unremitting

because
it

inflicted
exclusively
upon
the
weaker

at

the
most
susceptible
of

yet
because
the

are
so

deplorable

the
excess

many
of
whom
have
been
conspicuously
loud
in
denouncing
the
cruelties
of

more
venial

in
expressing

somewhat
clamorous
and
overacted
sympathy
with

which
can
not

remark

appear
harsh

the
evidence

warrants
it
that

at

longer
which
the

objected

frequently

seven

if
any
particular
order
was

be
executed
as
mournings
or

and
they
left

on
saturday
night
at
eleven
they
worked
the
whole
of
sunday
thinks
this
happened
fifteen
times
in
the
two
years
in
consequence
of
working
so
late
on
sunday
morning
or
all
that
day
occasionally
could
very
rarely
go
to
church
indeed
it
could
not
be
thought
of
because
they
generally
rested
in

the
correctness
of
these
representations
is
confirmed
among
others
by
the
following
medical
witnesses
sir
james
clark
physician
to
the
queen
have
found
the
mode
of
life
of
these
poor
girls
such
as
no
constitution
could
long
bear
worked
from
six
in
the
morning
till
twelve
at
night
with
the
exception
of
the
short
intervals
allowed
for
their
meals
in
close
rooms
and
passing
the
few
hours
allowed
for
rest
in
still
more
close
and
crowded
apartments
a
mode
of
life
more
completely
calculated
to
destroy
human
health
could
scarcely
be
contrived
and
this
at
a
period
of
life
when
exercise
in
the
open
air
and
a
due
proportion
of
rest
are
essential
to
the
development
of
the
system
judging
from
what
i
have
observed
and
heard
i
scarcely
believed
that
the
system
adopted
in
our
manufactories
can
be
so
destructive
of
health
as
the
life
of
the
young
dressmaker
protracted
labor
described
above
says
the
i
believe
quite
unparalleled
in
the
history
of
manufacturing
processes
i
have
looked
over
a
considerable
portion
of
the
report
of
the
factory
commission
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
accounts
of
the
factories
to
be
compared
with
the
facts
elicited
in
the
present
enquiry
gentlemen
who
from
their
official
situation
were
well
qualified
to
judge
have
also
stated
in
answer
to
my
questions
that
they
knew
of
no
instance
in
which
the
hours
of
work
were
so
long
as
those
above
stated
of
the
general
treatment
and
condition
of
these
young
people
the
reports
evidence
of
all
parties
establishes
the
fact
that
there
is
no
class
of
persons
in
this
country
living
by
their
labor
whose
happiness
health
and
lives
are
so
unscrupulously
sacrificed
as
those
of
the
young
dressmakers
it
may
without
exaggeration
be
stated
that
in
proportion
to
the
numbers
employed
there
are
no
occupations
with
one
or
two
questionable
exceptions
such
as
in
which
so
much
disease
is
produced
as
in
dressmaking
or
which
present
so
fearful
a
catalogue
of
distressing
and
frequently
fatal
maladies
it
is
a
serious
aggravation
of
all
this
evil
that
the
unkindness
of
the
employer
very
frequently
causes
these
young
persons
when
they
become
unwell
to
conceal
their
illness
from
the
fear
of
being
sent
out
of
the
house
and
in
this
manner
the
disease
often
becomes
increased
in
severity
or
is
even
rendered
incurable
some
of
the
principals
are
so
cruel
as
to
object

the
young

the
london
globe
on
west
india
emancipation
we
find
the
following
frank
and
explicit
admission
in
the
globe
of
july
our
own
west
india
islands
are
fast
relapsing
into
primitive
savageness
when
the
rich
lands
of
jamaica
are
being
yearly
abandoned
and
when
in
trinidad
and
guiana
cultivation
has
almost
ceased
it
is
not
likely
that
england
will
care
to
extend
her
sovereignty
further
over
tropical
territory
which
can
only
be
brought
into
use
by
a
system
which
has
been
solemnly
condemned
now
let
us
rigidly
examine
and
ascertain
what
is
the
condemned
system
what
the
approved
system
that
has
been
generally
adopted
in
its
stead
and
why
this
system
is
approved
and
the
free
negro
system
condemned
as
a
failure
there
is
no
doubt
the
writer
alludes
to
the
system
of
domestic
slavery
in
the
general
as
the
condemned
system
and
especially
to
that
serfdom
or
villienage
which
lately
prevailed
but
is
now
abolished
throughout
western
europe
in
asserting
that
the
system
of
slavery
has
been
condemned
and
yet
admitting
west
india
emancipation
to
be
a
failure
he
in
effect
maintains
that
the
liberation
of
the
villiens
has
been
no
failure
he
means
that
it
has
been
no
failure
because
the
liberated
villiens
do
work
aye
just
twice
as
hard
and
as
long
as
their
ancestors
the
serfs
he
means
it
is
no
failure
because
they
not
only
work
harder
and
longer
but
work
for
half
the
pay
or
allowance
of
their
servile
ancestors
he
means
it
is
no
failure
because
the
once
masters
now
employers
get
their
labor
for
half
what
it
cost
to
support
them
as
slaves
he
means
it
is
no
failure
because
free
labor
in
england
is
more
plentiful
and
far
cheaper
than
slave
labor
in
america
he
means
it
is
no
failure
because
the
employers
besides
getting
cheaper
and
more
abundant
labor
are
relieved
of
all
the
cares
and
anxieties
of
governing
and
providing
for
their
laborers
in
health
and
in
sickness
in
old
age
and
in
infancy
in
fine
he
means
it
is
no
failure
because
the
laborers
of
england
are
not
half
so
free
now
as
before
their
pretended
emancipation
they
have
lost
all
their
rights
half
their
liberty
for
they
work
harder
than
before
and
their
former
masters
have
been
relieved
of
all
their
legal
obligations
and
responsibilities
no
british
emancipation
has
not
failed
if
we
look
solely
to
the
selfish
interests
of
the
property
class
and
british
liberty
we
shall
show
in
another
chapter
means
the
unlimited
right
of
the
property
class
to
oppress
the
laboring
class
uncoupled
with
the
obligation
to
provide
for
them
but
this
writer
well
knew
that
looking
to
the
effect
of
emancipation
on
the
condition
of
the
laboring
class
in
england
it
has
been
a
cruel
and
monstrous
failure
from
first
to
last
they
are
almost
as
savage
and
ignorant
as
west
india
negroes
know
nothing
of
the
bible
and
live
in
a
state
of
continued
destitution
hunger
and
excessive
labor
from
generation
to
generation
from
infancy
to
old
age
west
india
emancipation
was
a
blunder
of
swindling
philanthropy
people
were
told
that
the
negroes
after
emancipation
would
work
harder
work
for
less
and
be
more
of
slaves
than
before
just
as
had
happened
with
emancipated
english
but
philanthropy
hath
bad
luck
it
overlooked
or
forgot
the
few
wants
and
indolent
habits
of
the
negro
the
abundance
of
mountain
lands
the
fertile
soil
the
volunteer
fruits
and
mild
climate
of
jamaica
the
negro
free
and
luxuriates
in
sloth
ignorance
and
liberty
as
none
but
a
negro
can
the
mistake
and
the
failure
consisted
in
setting
him
really
free
instead
of
nominally
so

what
vile
hypocrisy
to
shed
crocodile
tears
over
the
happy
negro
and
boast
of

liberty
which
is
daily
and
hourly
consuming
by
poverty
and
cold
and
foul
air
and
water
and
downright
starvation
the
lives
of
ten
millions
of
your
white
brethren
and
neighbors
but
this
system
which
carried
to
untimely
graves
three
hundred
thousand
irishmen
in
a
single
season
has
not
been
no
it
is
profitable
to
the
oppressors
and
will
not
be
condemned
in
all
countries
where
a
few
own
the
property
and
the
population
is
tolerably
dense
laborers
relieved
from
domestic
slavery
are
remitted
to
the
exploitation
of
skill
and
capital
which
renders
them
less
free
and
worse
situated
in
all
respects
after
emancipation
than
before
to
prove
this
great
truth
is
the
chief
object
of
our
present
work
we
know
that
the
philosophy
of
the
subject
is
intricate
and
complex
and
that
we
have
the
prejudices
fanaticism
and
prepossessions
of
a
world
to
oppose
and
conquer
we
therefore
indulge
in
frequent
iteration
and
adduce
numerous
proofs
examples
and
illustrations
chapter
xix
protection
and
charity
to
the
weak
a
mere
verbal
formula
often
distinguishes
a
truism
from
a
paradox
it
is
the
duty
of
society
to
protect
the
weak
but
protection
can
not
be
efficient
without
the
power
of
control
therefore
it
is
the
duty
of
society
to
enslave
the
weak
and
it
is
a
duty
which
no
organized
and
civilized
society
ever
failed
to
perform
parents
husbands
guardians
teachers
committees
c
are
but
masters
under
another
name
whose
duty
it
is
to
protect
the
weak
and
whose
right
it
is
to
control
them
the
blacks
in
america
are
both
positively
and
relatively
weak
positively
so
because
they
are
too
improvident
to
lay
up
for
the
exigencies
of
sickness
of
the
seasons
or
of
old
age
relatively
so
because
they
are
wholly
unequal
to
the
whites
among
whom
they
live
in
the
war
of
the
wits
and
free
competition
which
universal
liberty
begets
and
political
economy
encourages
in
old
countries
the
white
laborers
are
relatively
weak
because
all
property
is
closely
appropriated
and
the
capitalist
class
possess
the
means
of
unlimited
oppression
everybody
admits
that
in
such
countries
the
poor
need
protection
but
there
can
be
no
efficient
protection
without
enslavement
of
some
sort
in
england
it
has
often
been
remarked
that
all
the
legislation
for
the
poor
is
borrowed
from
the
system
of
domestic
slavery
public
and
private
charity
is
a
fund
created
by
the
labor
of
the
industrious
poor
and
too
often
bestowed
on
the
idle
or
improvident
it
is
apt
to
aggravate
the
evils
which
it
intends
to
cure
those
who
give
should
have
the
power
to
control
to
some
extent
the
conduct
and
expenditure
of
the
objects
of
their
charity
not
till
then
can
they
be
sure
that
their
gifts
will
be
promotive
of
good
but
such
power
of
control
would
be
slavery
can
abolitionists
solve
these
social
problems
ambition
has
ever
been
considered
the
most
noble
of
human
failings
it
is
however
no
failing
or
crime
at
all
ambition
desires
power
and
without
power
there
can
be
no
safe
prudent
and
active
benevolence
the
selfish
the
indolent
and
the
timid
are
without
ambition
and
eschew
power
because
of
the
trouble
the
expenses
and
the
responsibilities
which
it
imposes
the
actively
good
are
always
ambitious
and
desire
to
possess
power
in
order
that
they
may
control
in
some
measure
the
conduct
of
those
whom
they
desire
to
benefit
the
best
thing
a
philanthropist
can
do
is
to
buy
slaves
because
then
his
power
of
control
is
greatest
his
ability
to
do
practical
good
most
perfect
we
take
this
occasion
to
correct
an
error
into
which
we
had
fallen
as
to
northern
character
benevolence
affection
generosity
and
philanthropy
are
equally
common
north
and
south
and
only
differ
in
their
modes
of
manifestation
we
are
one
people
the
daily
and
hourly
exercise
of
these
qualities
is
elicited
at
the
south
because
it
is
safe
prudent
and
expedient
so
to
exercise
them
the
reverse
is
true
at
the
north
yet
expel
nature
and
she
will
return
again
man
is
social
and
philanthropic
and
his
affections
dammed
out
in
one
direction
find
vent
and
gush
out
in
another
the
people
of
the
north
are
far
more
generous
and
munificent
in
the
endowment
of
public
charities
and
other
public
institutions
than
we
this
correction
of
our
error
does
not
affect
our
theories
if
it
be
true
that
you
can
only
safely
be
charitable
to
dependents
whom
you
can
control
but
if
it
did
or
does
affect
neutralize
and
subvert
them
it
is
due
to
truth
and
if
we
advance
the
cause
of
truth
we
are
ready
for
the
sacrifice
of
all
else
our
trip
to
the
north
excited
doubts
as
to
our
estimate
of
northern
character
and
subsequent
observation
reading
and
reflection
have
brought
us
to
the
conclusion
which
we
now
with
pleasure
avow
we
would
rather
be
right
than
consistent

the

point
the
overthrow
of

the

of

for
the
sovereignty
of

this
is
the

of

and
towards
this
end

and
the
practices

from

the
more
numerous
and
timid
class
are
represented
by
greeley
and

would
not

rush
like
french

with
the
explosive
force

blank
to
the
bull
eye
of

would

conditions
that
would

bring
about

result
greeley
does
not
propose
to
do
away
at
once
with
marriage
religion
private
property
political
government
and
parental
authority
but
adopts
the
philosophy
and
the
practices
of
fourier
which
promise
gradually
to
purify
human
nature
and
fit
it
in
a
few
generations
for
that
social
millenium
into
which
the
bolder
and
more
consistent
andrews
urges
society
at
once
to
plunge
the
christian
socialists
are
beautifully
and
energetically
with
the
infidel
socialists
and
abolitionists
to
bring
about
this
millenium
they
also
are
divided
into
two
parties
the
one
would
wait
upon
providence
only
help
it
a
little
like
greeley
and
permit
our
poor
old
effete
world
to
pass
out
of
existence
by
gentle
euthanasia
the
other
and
bolder
party
feel
themselves
called
as
special
instruments
to
give
at
once
the
coup
de
grace
to
the
old
world
and
to
usher
in
the
new
golden
age
of
free
love
and
free
lands
of
free
women
and
free
negroes
of
free
children
and
free
men
we
like
the
northern
socialist
theoretical
abolitionists
read
their
speeches
essays
lectures
and
books
because
they
agree
with
us
that
their
own
form
of
society
is
a
humbug
and
a
failure
and
in
their
efforts
speculations
and
schemes
to
it
afford
the
most
beautiful
perfect
and
complete
specimen
of
the
reductio
ad
absurdum
a
lecture
from
andrews
on
an
oneida
den
of
incest
a
greeley
phalanstery
or
a
new
york
free
love
saloon
afford
equally
good
instances
of
this
mode
of
demonstration
by
the
absurdities
which
they
exhibit
and
equally
good
proofs
of
the
naturalness
and
necessity
of
slavery
since
such
horrid
abuses
are
everywhere
the
approved
and
practiced
outgrowth
of
free
society
as
all
our
thoughts
arguments
proofs
and
demonstrations
are
suggested
by
or
borrowed
from
the
abolitionists
it
seems
to
us
we
ought
to
dedicate
to
them
the
tribune
very
properly
remarked
that
our
sociology
was
the
first
attempt
of
the
kind
at
the
south
it
ridiculed
our
ignorance
too
severely
it
should
have
recollected
that
were
there
no
sickness
there
would
be
no
physicians
we
assure
the
tribune
we
are
quite
a
prodigy
in
these
matters
for
a
southern
man
we
have
no
social
diseases
and
therefore
no
social
doctors
to
write
about
them
or
cure
them
such
diseases
have
been
rare
for
aristotle
complains
that
there
are
no
terms
to
express
the
relations
of
husband
and
wife
or
parent
and
child
these
relations
have
worked
so
smoothly
in
slave
society
to
this
day
that
we
in
writing
have
felt
the
same
want
of
language
of
which
aristotle
more
than
two
thousand
years
ago
complained
you
should
invent
such
terms
at
the
north
if
it
be
true
as
andrews
states
in
italics
that
there
are
ten
fugitives
from
northern
matrimony
to
one
from
southern
slavery
from
which
he
seems
to
infer
very
logically
that
the
necessity
of
abolishing
the
family
at
the
north
is
ten
times
as
great
as
that
for
abolishing
slavery
at
the
south
he
and
you
are
experts
and
we
know
it
is
presumptuous
in
us
to
dispute
what
you
say
about
your
own
society
still
we
are
dead
against
your
phalansteries
and
his
love
saloons
gentlemen
and
scholars
generally
at
the
south
would
as
soon
be
caught
studying
or
practicing
the
black
art
as
in
reading
owen
or
fourier
or
in
building
phalansteries
for
ourselves
like
the
bastard
in
king
john
we
learn
these
things
not
to
deceive
but
to
avoid
deceit
we
have
whole
files
of
infidel
and
abolition
papers
like
the
tribune
the
liberator
and
investigator
fanny
wright
the
devil
pulpit
and
the
parson
tom
paine
owen
voltaire
et
id
genus
omne
are
our
daily
companions
good
people
give
our
office
a
wide
berth
as
they
pass
it
and
even
the
hens
who
loiter
about
it
have
caught
the
infection
of
woman
rights
for
we
saw
but
as
few
days
ago
a
shanghai
cock
under
its
eaves
hovering
a
brood
of
twenty
chickens
whilst
madam
hen
was
strutting
about
in
as
large
a
liberty
as
any
bloomer
or
wise
woman
of
the
north
love
and
veneration
for
the
family
is
with
us
not
only
a
principle
but
probably
a
prejudice
and
a
weakness
we
were
never
two
weeks
at
a
time
from
under
the
family
roof
until
we
had
passed
middle
life
and
now
that
our
years
almost
number
half
a
century
we
have
never
been
from
home
for
an
interval
of
two
months
and
our
historical
reading
as
well
as
our
habits
of
life
may
have
unfitted
us
to
appreciate
the
communist
and
fusion
theories
of
fanny
wright
owen
and
greely
in
attempting
to
vindicate
and
justify
the
ways
of
god
and
nature
against
the
progressiveness
of
black
republicanism
in
america
and
red
republicanism
in
europe
we
would
forewarn
the
reader
that
we
are
a
prejudiced
witness
we
are
the
enthusiastic
admirer
of
the
social
relations
exhibited
in
the
histories
of
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
the
social
relations
established
in
deuteronomy
and
chapter
leviticus
and
as
practiced
by
the
jews
to
this
day
elicit
our
unfeigned
admiration
and
approval
moses
is
with
us
the
prince
of
legislators
and
the
leviticus
the
best
of
political
platforms
the
purity
of
the
family
seems
to
be
his
paramount
object
homer
too
especially
in
his
odyssey
charms
and
enchains
us
with
his
beautiful
descriptions
of
family
felicity
and
family
purity
as
conquest
and
commerce
introduced
wealth
and
corrupted
morals
and
manners
the
family
was
corrupted
and
disrupted
as
it
is
now
at
the
most
commercial
points
in
the
north
but
we
have
only
to
pass
over
to
italy
and
there
from
the
earliest
days
of
tradition
until
the
extinction
of
liberty
began
by
sylla
and
marius
and
ended
by
augustus
we
find
the
family
a
pure
a
holy
and
sacred
thing
from
that
era
till
slavery
arose
in
the
south
the
family
never
resumed
its
dignity
and
importance
feudalism
did
something
to
correct
the
loose
morality
of
the
augustan
age
but
it
adopted
its
colonial
slavery
relaxed
family
ties
and
never
drew
together
in
sufficiently
close
connection
and
subordination
the
materials
which
nature
dictates
should
form
the
human
hive
or
social
circle
aristotle
understood
this
subject
thoroughly
and
it
seems
to
have
been
generally
so
well
comprehended
in
his
day
that
he
takes
little
trouble
to
explain
and
expound
it
he
commences
his
treatise
on
politics
and
economics
with
the
family
and
discourses
first
of
the
slaves
as
a
part
of
the
family
he
assumes
that
social
life
is
as
natural
to
man
as
to
bees
and
herds
and
that
the
family
including
husband
wife
children
and
slaves
is
the
first
and
most
natural
development
of
that
social
nature
as
states
are
composed
of
families
and
as
a
sound
and
healthy
whole
can
not
be
formed
of
rotten
parts
he
devotes
much
of
his
treatise
to
family
education
and
government
would
that
modern
statesmen
philosophers
and
politicians
would
become
practical
like
aristotle
and
not
attempt
to
build
social
and
political
edifices
until
they
were
sure
of
the
soundness
of
the
materials
of
which
they
would
construct
them
as
all
human
beings
live
for
the
greatest
part
of
their
lives
in
families
it
is
all
important
that
they
should
look
to
the
wise
arrangement
of
this
old
and
universal
institution
we
wish
to
prove
that
the
great
movement
in
society
known
under
various
names
as
communism
socialism
abolitionism
red
republicanism
and
black
republicanism
has
one
common
object
the
breaking
up
of
all
law
and
government
and
the
inauguration
of
anarchy
and
that
the
destruction
of
the
family
is
one
of
the
means
in
which
they
all
concur
to
attain
a
common
end
we
shall
quote
only
from
stephen
pearle
andrews
because
he
is
by
far
the
ablest
and
best
informed
of
american
socialists
and
reformers
and
because
he
cites
facts
and
authorities
to
show
that
he
presents
truly
the
current
thought
and
the
general
intention
andrews
is
a
massachusetts
gentleman
who
has
lived
at
the
south
he
has
been
an
abolition
lecturer
he
is
the
disciple
of
warren
who
is
the
disciple
of
owen
of
lanark
and
new
harmony
owen
and
warren
are
socrates
and
plato
and
he
is
the
great
stygarite
as
far
surpassing
them
as
aristotle
surpassed
socrates
and
plato
but
it
is
not
merely
his
theories
on
which
we
rely
he
cites
historical
facts
that
show
that
the
tendency
and
terminus
of
all
abolition
is
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
individual
the
breaking
up
of
families
and
he
delivered
a
series
of
lectures
to
the
elite
of
new
york
on
this
subject
which
met
with
approbation
and
from
which
we
shall
quote
he
established
or
aided
to
establish
free
love
villages
and
headed
a
free
love
saloon
in
the
city
of
new
york
patronized
and
approved
by
the
higher
classes
he
is
indubitably
the
philosopher
and
true
exponent
of
northern
abolitionism
with
this
assertion
which
none
who
read
his
science
of
society
we
think
will
deny
we
proceed
to
quote
from
his
able
and
beautiful
lectures
embodied
in
a
publication
entitled
science
of
society
our
first
quotation
is
from
his
first
lecture
and
the
first
chapter
of
his
work
every
age
is
a
remarkable
one
no
doubt
for
those
who
live
in
it
when
immobility
reigns
most
in
human
affairs
there
is
still
enough
of
movement
to
fix
the
attention
and
even
to
excite
the
wonder
of
those
who
are
immediately
in
proximity
with
it
this
natural
bias
in
favor
of
the
period
with
which
we
have
most
to
do
is
by
no
means
sufficient
however
to
account
for
the
growing
conviction
on
all
minds
that
the
present
epoch
is
a
marked
transition
from
an
old
to
a
new
order
of
things
the
scattered
rays
of
the
gray
dawn
of
the
new
era
date
back
indeed
beyond
the
lifetime
of
the
present
generation
the
first
streak
of
light
that
streamed
through
the
dense
darkness
of
the
old
was
the
declaration
by
martin
luther
of
the
right
of
private
judgment
in
matters
of
conscience
the
next
which
shed
terror
upon
the
old
world
as
a
new
portent
of
impending
revolutions
was
the
denial
by
hampden
sidney
cromwell
and
others
of
the
divine
right
of
kings
and
the
assertion
of
inherent
political
rights
in
the
people
themselves
this
was
followed
by
the
american
declaration
of
independence
the
establishment
of
a
powerful
democratic
republic
in
the
western
world
upon
the
basis
of
that
principle
followed
by
the
french
revolution
the
reign
of
terror
the
and
the
apparent
death
in
europe
of
the
democratic
idea
finally
in
our
day
comes
the
red
glare
of
french
socialism
at
which
the
world
is
still
gazing
with
uncertainty
whether
it
be
some
lurid
and
meteoric
omen
of
fearful
events
or
whether
it
be
not
the
actual
rising
of
the
sun
of
righteousness
with
healing
in
his
wings
for
there
are
those
who
profoundly
and
religiously
believe
that
the
solution
of
the
social
problem
will
be
the
virtual
descent
of
the
new
jerusalem
the
installation
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
upon
earth
first
in
the
religious
then
in
the
political
and
finally
in
the
social
relations
of
men
new
doctrines
have
thus
been
broached
which
are
full
of
promise
to
the
hopeful
and
full
of
alarm
and
dismay
to
the
timid
and
conservative
this
distinction
marks
the
broadest
division
in
the
ranks
of
mankind
in
church
and
state
and
social
life
the
real
parties
are
the
progressionists
and
the
retrogressionists
those
whose
most
brilliant
imaginings
are
linked
with
the
future
and
those
whose
sweetest
remembrances
bind
them
in
tender
associations
to
the
past
catholic
and
protestant
whig
and
democrat
and
socialist
are
terms
which
in
their
origin
correspond
to
this
generic
division
but
no
sooner
does
a
new
classification
take
place
than
the
parties
thus
formed
are
again
subdivided
on
either
hand
by
the
tendency
on
the
one
side
toward
freedom
emancipation
and
progress
and
toward
law
and
order
and
immobility
on
the
other
hitherto
the
struggle
between
conservatism
and
progress
has
seemed
doubtful
victory
has
kissed
the
banner
alternately
of
either
host
at
length
the
serried
ranks
of
conservatism
falter
reform
so
called
is
becoming
confessedly
more
potent
than
its
antagonist
the
admission
is
reluctantly
forced
from
pallid
lips
that
revolutions
political
social
and
religious
constitute
the
programme
of
the
coming
age
reform
so
called
for
weal
or
woe
but
yet
reform
must
rule
the
hour
the
older
constitutions
of
society
have
outlived
their
day
no
truth
commends
itself
more
universally
to
the
minds
of
men
now
than
that
thus
set
forth
by
carlyle
there
must
be
a
new
world
if
there
is
to
be
any
world
at
all
that
human
things
in
our
europe
can
ever
return
to
the
old
sorry
routine
and
proceed
with
any
steadiness
or
continuance
there
this
small
hope
is
not
now
a
tenable
one
these
days
of
universal
death
must
be
days
of
universal
new
birth
if
the
ruin
is
not
to
be
total
and
final
it
is
a
time
to
make
the
dullest
man
consider
and
ask
himself
whence
he
came
whither
he
is
bound
a
veritable
era
to
the
foolish
as
well
as
to
the
wise
nor
is
this
state
of
things
confined
to
europe
the
agitations
in
america
may
be
more
peaceful
but
they
are
not
less
profound
the
foundations
of
old
beliefs
and
habits
of
thought
are
breaking
up
the
old
guarantees
of
order
are
fast
falling
away
a
veritable
new
era
with
us
too
is
alike
impending
and
inevitable
so
much
to
show
the
width
and
scope
of
the
social
revolution
that
is
contemplated
as
well
by
destructives
as
conservatives
for
carlyle
is
like
ourselves
and
thinks
society
needs
more
government
screwing
up
instead
of
relaxing
he
too
is
a
socialist
but
a
conservative
socialist
he
asserts
like
andrews
that
society
has
failed
but
proposes
a
different
mode
of
reconstruction
at
the
very
moment
we
in
america
were
announcing
the
failure
of
free
society
he
in
europe
proclaimed
the
day
of
that
society
it
was
but
a
different
mode
of
expressing
the
same
thought
now
we
will
show
from
this
same
lecture
of
andrews
that
the
annihilation
of
the
family
is
part
of
the
programme
of
abolition
he
says
page
in
this
same
lecture
every
variety
of
conscience
and
every
variety
of
deportment
in
reference
to
this
precise
subject
of
love
is
already
tolerated
among
us
at
one
extreme
of
the
scale
stand
the
shakers
who
abjure
the
connection
of
the
sexes
altogether
at
the
other
extremity
stands
the
association
of
perfectionists
at
oneida
who
hold
and
practice
and
justify
by
the
scriptures
as
a
religious
dogma
what
they
denominate
complex
marriage
or
the
freedom
of
love
we
have
in
this
state
stringent
laws
against
adultery
and
fornication
but
laws
of
that
sort
fall
powerless
in
america
before
the
sentiment
of
protestantism
which
vindicates
the
freedom
of
conscience
to
all
persons
and
in
all
things
provided
the
consequences
fall
upon
the
parties
themselves
hence
the
oneida
perfectionists
live
undisturbed
and
respected
in
the
heart
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
in
the
face
of
the
world
and
the
civil
government
true
to
the
democratic
principle
which
is
only
the
same
principle
in
another
application
is
little
anxious
to
interfere
with
this
breach
of
its
own
ordinances
so
long
as
they
cast
none
of
the
consequences
of
their
conduct
upon
those
who
do
not
consent
to
bear
them
and
page
he
says
in
general
however
government
still
interferes
with
the
marriage
and
parental
relations
democracy
in
america
has
always
proceeded
with
due
reference
to
the
prudential
motto
in
france
at
the
time
of
the
first
revolution
democracy
rushed
with
the
explosive
force
of
escapement
from
centuries
of
compression
point
blank
to
the
bull
eye
of
its
final
destiny
from
which
it
recoiled
with
such
force
that
the
stupid
world
has
dreamed
for
half
a
century
that
the
vital
principle
of
democracy
was
dead
as
a
logical
sequence
from
democratic
principle
the
legal
obligation
of
marriage
was
sundered
and
the
sovereignty
of
the
individual
above
the
institution
was
vindicated
page
i
must
apologize
as
well
for
the
incompleteness
as
for
the
apparent
dogmatism
of
any
brief
exposition
of
this
subject
i
assert
that
it
is
not
only
possible
and
rationally
probable
but
that
it
is
rigidly
consequential
upon
the
right
understanding
of
the
constitution
of
man
that
all
government
in
the
sense
of
involuntary
restraint
upon
the
individual
or
substantially
all
must
finally
cease
and
along
with
it
the
whole
complicated
paraphernalia
and
trumpery
of
kings
emperors
presidents
legislatures
and
judiciary
i
assert
that
the
indicia
of
this
result
abound
in
existing
society
and
that
it
is
the
instinctive
or
intelligent
perception
of
that
fact
by
those
who
have
not
bargained
for
so
much
which
gives
origin
and
vital
energy
to
the
in
church
and
state
and
social
life
i
assert
that
the
distance
is
less
forward
from
the
theory
and
practice
of
government
as
it
is
in
these
united
states
to
the
total
abrogation
of
all
government
above
that
of
the
individual
than
it
is
backward
to
the
theory
and
practice
of
government
as
government
now
is
in
the
despotic
countries
of
the
old
world
the
reader
will
thus
see
that

in

countries
and

may
elapse
before
the
question
will
be
practically
suggested
whether
slavery
to
capital
be
preferable
to
slavery
to
human
masters
but
the
negro
has
neither
energy
nor
enterprise
and
even
in
our
sparser
population
finds
with
his
improvident
habits
that
his
liberty
is
a
curse
to
himself
and
a
greater
curse
to
the
society
around
him
these
considerations
and
others
equally
obvious
have
induced
the
south
to
attempt
to
defend
negro
slavery
as
an
exceptional
institution
admitting
nay
asserting
that
slavery
in
the
general
or
in
the
abstract
is
morally
wrong
and
against
common
right
with
singular
inconsistency
after
making
this
admission
which
admits
away
the
authority
of
the
bible
of
profane
history
and
of
the
almost
universal
practice
of
mankind
they
turn
round
and
attempt
to
bolster
up
the
cause
of
negro
slavery
by
these
very
exploded
authorities
if
we
mean
not
to
repudiate
all
divine
and
almost
all
human
authority
in
favor
of
slavery
we
must
vindicate
that
institution
in
the
abstract
to
insist
that
a
status
of
society
which
has
been
almost
universal
and
which
is
expressly
and
continually
justified
by
holy
writ
is
its
natural
normal
and
necessary
status
under
the
ordinary
circumstances
is
on
its
face
a
plausible
and
probable
proposition
to
insist
on
less
is
to
yield
our
cause
and
to
give
up
our
religion
for
if
white
slavery
be
morally
wrong
be
a
violation
of
natural
rights
the
bible
can
not
be
true
human
and
divine
authority
do
seem
in
the
general
to
concur
in
establishing
the
expediency
of
having
masters
and
slaves
of
different
races
the
nominal
servitude
of
the
jews
to
each
other
in
its
temporary
character
and
no
doubt
in
its
mild
character
more
nearly
resembled
our
wardship
and
apprenticeship
than
ordinary
domestic
slavery
in
very
many
nations
of
antiquity
and
in
some
of
modern
times
the
law
has
permitted
the
native
citizens
to
become
slaves
to
each
other
but
few
take
advantage
of
such
laws
and
the
infrequency
of
the
practice
establishes
the
general
truth
that
master
and
slave
should
be
of
different
national
descent
in
some
respects
the
wider
the
difference
the
better
as
the
slave
will
feel
less
mortified
by
his
position
in
other
respects
it
may
be
that
too
wide
a
difference
hardens
the
hearts
and
brutalizes
the
feelings
of
both
master
and
slave
the
civilized
man
hates
the
savage
and
the
savage
returns
the
hatred
with
interest
hence
west
india
slavery
of
newly
caught
negroes
is
not
a
very
humane
affectionate
or

institution
virginia
negroes
have
become
moral
and
intelligent
they
love
their
master
and
his
family
and
the
attachment
is
reciprocated
still
we
like
the
idle
but
intelligent
better
than
the
but
stupid
and
we
like
the
mulatto
better
than
the
negro
yet
the
negro
is
generally
more
affectionate
contented
and
faithful
the
world
at
large
looks
on
negro
slavery
as
much
the
worst
form
of
slavery
because
it
is
only
acquainted
with
west
india
slavery
abolition
never
arose
till
negro
slavery
was
instituted
and
now
abolition
is
only
directed
against
negro
slavery
there
is
no
philanthropic
crusade
attempting
to
set
free
the
white
slaves
of
eastern
europe
and
of
asia
the
world
then
is
prepared
for
the
defence
of
slavery
in
the
abstract
it
is
prejudiced
only
against
negro
slavery
these
prejudices
were
in
their
origin
well
founded
the
slave
trade
the
horrors
of
the
middle
passage
and
west
india
slavery
were
enough
to
rouse
the
most
torpid
philanthropy
but
our
southern
slavery
has
become
a
benign
and
protective
institution
and
our
negroes
are
confessedly
better
off
than
any
free
laboring
population
in
the
world
how
can
we
contend
that
white
slavery
is
wrong
whilst
all
the
great
body
of
free
laborers
are
starving
and
slaves
white
or
black
throughout
the
world
are
enjoying
comfort
we
write
in
the
cause
of
truth
and
humanity
and
will
not
play
the
advocate
for
master
or
for
slave
the
aversion
to
negroes
the
antipathy
of
race
is
much
greater
at
the
north
than
at
the
south
and
it
is
very
probable
that
this
antipathy
to
the
person
of
the
negro
is
confounded
with
or
generates
hatred
of
the
institution
with
which
he
is
usually
connected
hatred
to
slavery
is
very
generally
little
more
than
hatred
of
negroes
there
is
one
strong
argument
in
favor
of
negro
slavery
over
all
other
slavery
that
he
being
unfitted
for
the
mechanic
arts
for
trade
and
all
skillful
pursuits
leaves
those
pursuits
to
be
carried
on
by
the
whites
and
does
not
bring
all
industry
into
disrepute
as
in
greece
and
rome
where
the
slaves
were
not
only
the
artists
and
mechanics
but
also
the
merchants
whilst
as
a
general
and
abstract
question
negro
slavery
has
no
other
claims
over
other
forms
of
slavery
except
that
from
inferiority
or
rather
peculiarity
of
race
almost
all
negroes
require
masters
whilst
only
the
children
the
women
the
very
weak
poor
and
ignorant
c
among
the
whites
need
some
protective
and
governing
relation
of
this
kind
yet
as
a
subject
of
temporary
but
importance
negro
slavery
has
become
the
most
necessary
of
all
human
institutions
the
african
slave
trade
to
america
commenced
three
centuries
and
a
half
since
by
the
time
of
the
american
revolution
the
supply
of
slaves
had
exceeded
the
demand
for
slave
labor
and
the
slaveholders
to
get
rid
of
a
burden
and
to
prevent
the
increase
of
a
nuisance
became
violent
opponents
of
the
slave
trade
and
many
of
them
abolitionists
new
england
bristol
and
liverpool
who
reaped
the
profits
of
the
trade
without
suffering
from
the
nuisance
stood
out
for
a
long
time
against
its
abolition
finally
laws
and
treaties
were
made
and
fleets
fitted
out
to
abolish
it
and
after
a
while
the
slaves
of
most
of
south
america
of
the
west
indies
and
of
mexico
were
liberated
in
the
meantime
cotton
rice
sugar
coffee
tobacco
and
other
products
of
slave
labor
came
into
universal
use
as
necessaries
of
life
the
population
of
western
europe
sustained
and
stimulated
by
those
products
was
trebled
and
that
of
the
north
increased
tenfold
the
products
of
slave
labor
became
scarce
and
dear
and
famines
frequent
now
it
is
obvious
that
to
emancipate
all
the
negroes
would
be
to
starve
western
europe
and
our
north
not
to
extend
and
increase
negro
slavery
with
the
extension
and
multiplication
of
free
society
will
produce
much
suffering
if

we
do
not
doubt
that
its
moderate
use
is
essential
to
civilization
and
promotive
of
human
happiness
and
and
we
entertain
as
little
doubt
that
its

use
is
the
most
potent
of
all
causes
of
human
inequality
of
condition
of
excessive

and

money
is
the
great
weapon
in

which

not
this
monopoly
be
broken
up
because
says
the
objector
vested
rights
forbid
it
but
there
can
be
no
vested
rights
against
original
and
natural
rights
no
claim
of
a
part
of
the
human
family
to
the
while
earth
can
be
valid
against
the
claim
of
the
whole
human
family
to
it
no
passing
of
papers
or
parchments
in
former
generations
can
foreclose
the
rights
of
the
present
generation
no
bargains
and
no
conventional
titles
can
avail
in
justice
against
the
great
by
which
nature
grants
and
conveys
herself
to
each
generation
as
it
comes
upon
the
earth
and
by
which
she
makes
the
living
simply
because
they
are
the
living
and
not
at
all
because
of
their
relation
to
the
dead
the
equal
owners
of
her
soil
and
seas
her
light
and
air
no
arrangements
by
which
the
six
thousand
who
have
monopolized
the
lands
of
ireland
should
be
allowed
to
overcome
the
title
of
the
six
millions
to
it
if
the
natural
and
inherent
right
of
the
whole
is
not
paramount
to
that
which
the
fractions
claim
to
have
acquired
then
are
six
millions
born
into
the
world
and
then
is
the
creator
chargeable
with
a
lack
of
wisdom
and
goodness
if
it
is
right
that
the
mass
of
men
should
hold
their
on
the
earth
by
mere
sufferance
or
upon
terms
dictated
by
their
fellows
then
is
it
not
true
that
god
is
an
impartial
father
for
then
it
is
not
true
that
he
has
given
the
earth
to
all
his
children
but
only
to
a
select
we
too
think
free
society
a
very
bad
thing
and
a
decided
failure
but
not
half
so
bad
as
smith
paints
it
there
is
a
system
in
ireland
which
to
some
extent
recognizes
the
doctrine
that
all
men
are
entitled
to
live
on
the
earth
and
be
supported
from
it
in
practice
the
system
does
not
always
work
well
yet
we
are
confident
it
works
much
better
for
all
parties
than
would
smith
plan
of
agrarianism
but
slavery
does
in
practice
as
well
as
in
theory
acknowledge
and
enforce
the
right
of
all
to
be
comfortably
supported
from
the
soil
there
was
we
repeat
no
pauperism
in
europe
till
feudal
slavery
was
abolished
it
will
be
strange
indeed
if
the
voters
in
new
york
a
majority
of
whom
own
no
land
do
not
take
smith
at
his
word
and
assert
their
superior
claim
under
his
higher
law
and
fundamental
principles
to
all
the
land
is
a
concise
and
ingenious
syllogism
to
this
effect
the
earth
belongs
equally
to
all
mankind
under
the
higher
law
or
law
of
god
which
is
superior
to
all
human
laws
therefore
the
lackland
majority
have
a
better
right
to
the
soil
than
the
present
proprietors
whose
title
is
derived
from
mere
human
law
it
never
did
occur
to
us
that
the
paupers
had
the
best
right
to
all
the
farms
until
we
saw
this
new
application
of
the
higher
law
but
is
clear
as
if
you
grant
the
higher
law
as
expounded
by
seward
and
we
expect
soon
to
hear
that
they
are
bringing
their
titles
into
court
looked
this
way
and
chose
its
own
governor
and
judges
but
garrison
outbids
smith
all
hollow
for
the
pauper
vote
he
promises
not
only
to
every
one
his
vine
and
but
a
vine
and
that
will
bear
fruit
without
culture
he
is
going
to
get
up
a
terrestrial
paradise
in
which
there
will
be
no
jails
no
taxes
no
labor
no
want
no
sickness
no
pain
no
government
in
fact
no
anything
but
he
shall
speak
for
himself
we
find
the
following
in
the
of
august
indeed
properly
speaking
there
is
but
one
government
and
that
is
not
human
but
divine
there
is
but
one
law
and
that
is
higher
law
there
is
but
one
ruler
and
that
one
is
god
whom
we
live
and
move
and
have
our
being
what
is
called
human
government
is
usurpation
imposture
demagoguism
peculation
swindling
and
tyranny
more
or
less
according
to
circumstances
and
to
the
intellectual
and
moral
condition
of
the
people
unquestionably
every
existing
government
on

is
to
be
overthrown
by
the
growth
of

and
moral
regeneration
of
the
masses
absolutism
limited
monarchy
democracy
all
are
sustained
by
the
sword
all
are
based
upon
the
doctrine
that
makes
right
all
are
intrinsically
inhuman
selfish
clannish
and
opposed
to
a
recognition
of
the
brotherhood
of
man
they
are
to
liberty
what
whiskey
brandy
and
gin
are
to
temperance
they
belong
to
the
of
this
world
and
in
due
time
are
to
be
destroyed
by
the
brightness
of
the
coming
of
him
right
it
is
to
reign
and
by
the
erection
of
a
kingdom
which
can
not
be
shaken
they
are
not
for
the
people
but
make
the
people
their
prey
they
are
hostile
to
all
progress
they
resist
to
the
utmost
all
radical
changes
all
history
shows
that
liberty
humanity
justice
and

have
ever
been
in

we
can
not
reconcile
this

of

with
another

we
have
seen
imputed
to
him
in
the

that
there
is
no

because
no
beneficent
creator
would
have
so
constituted

as
to
have

almost
universal
now
assume
as
he
does
that
slavery
is
a
cruel
sinful
and
wicked
institution
destructive
alike
of
human
happiness
and
and
his
conclusion
is
irresistible
to
be
consistent
all
men
should
be
atheists
ere
long
we
suspect
their
consistency
will
equal
their
folly
and
profanity
with
us
who
think
slavery
a
benevolent
institution
equally
necessary
to
protect
the
weak
and
to
govern

he

with

we
do
not

there

between

and
that
which
has
been
for
many
years
past
practically
carried
out
in
oneida
county
new
york
by
the
perfectionists
who
construe
the
bible
into
authority
for
the
unrestrained
indulgence
of
every
sensual
appetite
the
doctrines
of
fourier
of
owen
and
fanny
wright
and
the
other
early
socialists
all
lead
to
and
free
love
is
probable
they
foresaw
and
intended
this
result
but
did
not
suggest
or
propose
it
to
a
world
then
too
wicked
and
unenlightened
to
appreciate
its
beatific
purity
and
loveliness
the
materials
as
well
as
the

thing
and
school
headed

conducted
in

by

parker
phillips
and
their

show
that
they
too
are
busy
with
assiduous
wedges
in
loosening
the
whole
frame
of
society
and
preparing
for
the
glorious
advent
of
free
love
and
all
the
infidel
and
abolition
papers
in
the
north
betray
a
similar
tendency
the
abolitionists
of
new
york
headed
by
gerrit
smith
and
wm
goodell
are
engaged
in
precisely
the
same
projects
but
being
christians
would
dignify
free
love
and
with
the
appellation
of
a
millenium
probably
half
the
abolitionists
at
the
north
expect
a
great
social
revolution
soon
to
occur
by
the
advent
of
the
millenium
if
they
would
patiently
await
that
event
instead
of
attempting
to
get
it
up
themselves
their
delusions
however
ridiculous
might
at
least
be
innocuous
but
these
progressive
christian
socialists
differ
not
at
all
from
the
infidel
socialists
of
boston
they
are
equally
intent
and
busy
in
pulling
down
the
priesthood
and
abolishing
or
dividing
all
property
seeing
that
whether
the
denouement
be
free
love
or
a
millenium
the
destruction
of
all
existing
human
relations
and
human
institutions
is
to
their
full
fruition
many
thousand
as
have
been
of
late
years
the
social
experiments
attempting
to
practice
community
of
property
of
wives
children
and
numerous
as
the
books
inculcating
and
approving
such
practices
yet
the
existence
and
growth
of
mormonism
is
of
itself
stronger
evidence
than
all
other
of
the
tendency
of
modern
free
society
towards
and
free
love
in
the
name
of
polygamy
it
has
practically
removed
all
restraints
to
the
intercourse
of
sexes
and
broken
up
the
family
it
promises
too
a
qualified
community
of
property
and
a
fraternal
association
of
labor
it
beats
up
monthly
thousands
of
recruits
from
free
society
in
europe
and
america
but
makes
not
one
convert
in
the
slaveholding
south
slavery
is
satisfied
and
conservative
abolition
finding
that
all
existing
legal
religious
social
and
governmental
institutions
restrict
liberty
and
occasion
a
quasi
slavery
is
resolved
not
to
stop
short
of
the
subversion
of
all
those
institutions
and
the
inauguration
of
free
love
and
the
only
cure
for
all
this
is
for
free
society
sternly
to
recognize
slavery
as
right
in
principle
and
necessary
in
practice
with
more
or
less
of
modification
to
the
very
existence
of
government
of
property
of
religion
and
of
social
existence
we
shall
not
attempt
to
reconcile
the
doctrines
of
the
socialists
which
propose
to
remove
all
legal
restraints
with
their
denunciations
of
political
economy
let
alone
is
the
essence
of
political
economy
and
the
whole
creed
of
most
of
the
socialists
the
political
economists
let
alone
for
a
fair
fight
for
universal
rivalry
antagonism
competition
and
cannibalism
they
say
the
eating
up
the
weaker
members
of
society
the
killing
them
out
by
capital
and
competition
will
improve
the
breed
of
men
and
benefit
society
they
foresee
the
consequences
of
their
doctrine
and
are
consistent
hobbes
saw
men
devouring
one
another
under
their
system
two
hundred
years
ago
and
we
all
see
them
similarly
engaged
now
the
socialists
promise
that
when
society
is
wholly
disintegrated
and
dissolved
by
inculcating
good
principles
and
singing
fraternity
over
it
all
men
will
love
and
help
one
another
they
place
men
in
positions
of
equality
rivalry
and
antagonism
which
must
result
in
extreme
selfishness
of
conduct
and
yet
propose
this
system
as
a
cure
for
selfishness
to
us
their
reasonings
seem
absurd
yet
the
doctrines
so
prevalent
with
abolitionists
and
socialists
of
free
love
and
free
lands
free
churches
free
women
and
free
negroes
of
property
and
are
legitimate
deductions
if
not
obvious
corollaries
from
the
leading
and
distinctive
axiom
of
political
economy
laissez
faire
or
let
alone
all
the
leading
socialists
and
abolitionists
of
the
north
we
think
agree
with
fanny
wright
that
the
gradual
changes
which
have
taken
place
in
social
organization
from
domestic
slavery
to
prædial
serfdom
and
thence
to
the
present
system
of
free
and
competitive
society
have
been
mere
transitive
states
each
placing
the
laborer
in
a
worse
condition
than
that
of
absolute
slavery
yet
valuable
as
preparing
the
way
for
a
new
and
more
perfect
social
state
they
value
the
present
state
of
society
the
more
highly
because
it
is
intolerable
and
must
the
sooner
usher
in
a
millenium
or
utopia

christian

impracticable

but
the
natural

it
is
strange
that

undiscovered

centuries
what
more

than
that

the

this

it
is
almost
equally
obvious
that
in

state
unselfishness

the
preference
of

will
be
a

times
greater
than
any

he
can
derive
by
stinting

their

do
much
more
to
render

wretched
than
what
he

them
can
compensate

too
see
and
feel
that
in
denying
themselves
and
promoting
the
happiness
of
the
head
of
the

they
pursue
true
policy
and
are
most
sensibly
selfish
when
they
seem
most
unselfish
especially
however
is
it
true
with
slaves
and
masters
that
to
do
as
they
would
be
done
by
is
mutually
beneficial
good
treatment
and
proper
discipline
renders
the
slave
happier
healthier
more
valuable
grateful
and
contented
obedience
industry
and

the

it

as
they
would
be
done
by
at

within
the
precincts
of
the

to
throw
off
into

wife

them

it

as
we

by

is
generally
the

of
and
is
easy
and
agreeable
to
be
indulgent

to
exact

severe
disciplinarians
are
the

they

easy

men
are

forfeit
the

whom
they

because
to
do
so
would
disturb
their
epicurean
repose
christian
morality
is
neither
difficult
nor
unnatural
where
dependent
family
and
slave
relations
exist
and
christian
morality
was
preached
and
only
intended
for
such
the
whole
moralé
of
free
society
is
every
man
woman
and
child
for
himself
and
herself
slavery
in
every
form
must
be
abolished
wives
must
have
distinct
separate
and
therefore
antagonistic
and
conflicting
interests
from
their
husbands
and
children
must
as
soon
as
possible
be
remitted
to
the
rights
of
manhood
is
it
not
passing
strange
wonderful
that
such
men
as
channing
and
wayland
did
not
see
that
their
world
of
universal
liberty
was
a
world
of
universal
selfishness
discord
competition
rivalry
and
war
of
the
wits
hobbes
did
see
it
and
supposing
there
was
no
other
world
said
a
state
of
nature
was
a
state
of
war
but
the
family
including
slaves
which
the
abolitionists
would
destroy
has
been
almost
universal
and
is
therefore
natural
christian
morality
is
the
natural
morality
in
slave
society
and
slave
society
is
the
only
natural
society
such
society
as
that
of
the
early
patriarchs
of
judea
under
moses
and
joshua
and
as
that
of
the
south
would
never
beget
a
sceptic
a
hobbes
a
wayland
nor
a
channing
in
such
society
it
is
natural
for
men
to
love
one
another
the
ordinary
relations
of
men
are
not
competitive
and
antagonistic
as
in
free
society
and
selfishness
is
not
general
but
exceptionable
duty
to
self
is
the
first
of
duties
free
society
makes
it
the
only
duty
man
is
not
naturally
selfish
or
bad
for
he
is
naturally
social
free
society
dissociates
him
and
makes
him
bad
and
selfish
from
necessity
it
is
said
in
scripture
that
it
is
harder
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
than
for
a
camel
to
pass
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
we
are
no
theologian
but
do
know
from
history
and
observation
that
wealthy
men
who
are
sincere
and
devout
christians
in
free
society
feel
at
a
loss
what
to
do
with
their
wealth
so
as
not
to
make
it
an
instrument
of
oppression
and
wrong
capital
and
skill
are
powers
exercised
almost
always
to
oppress
labor
if
you
endow
colleges
you
rear
up
cunning
voracious
exploitators
to
devour
the
poor
if
you
give
it
to
tradesmen
or
land
owners
is
still
an
additional
instrument
always
employed
to
oppress
laborers
if
you
give
it
to
the
really
needy
you
too
often
encourage
idleness
and
increase
the
burdens
of
the
working
poor
who
support
every
body
we
can
not
possibly
see
but
one
safe
way
to
invest
wealth
and
that
is
to
buy
slaves
with
it
whose
conduct
you
can
control
and
be
sure
that
your
charity
is
not
misapplied
and
mischievous
is
there
any
other
safe
way
of
investing
wealth
or
bestowing
charity
we
regret
that
delicacy
restrains
us
from
putting
the
question
to
a
celebrated
wealthy
philanthropist
of
the
north
who
is
candid
bold
experienced
and
an
abolitionist
to

slavery
its
effects
on
the

beaten
at
every
other
quarter
we
learn
that
a
distinguished
writer
at
the
north
is
about
to
be
put
forward
by
the
abolitionists
to
prove
that
the
influence
of
slavery
is
deleterious
on
the
whites
who
own
no
slaves
now
at
first
view
it
elevates
those
whites
for
it
makes
them
not
the
bottom
of
society
as
at
the
north
not
the
menials
the
hired
day
laborer
the
work
scavengers
and
scullions
but
privileged
citizens
like
greek
and
roman
citizens
with
a
numerous
class
far
beneath
them
in
slave
society
one
white
man
does
not
lord
it
over
another
for
all
are
equal
in
privilege
if
not
in
wealth
and
the
poorest
would
not
become
a
menial
hold
your
horse
and
then
extend
his
hand
or
his
hat
for
a
gratuity
were
you
to
proffer
him
the
wealth
of
the
indies
the
menial
the
exposed
and
laborious
and
the
disgraceful
occupations
are
all
filled
by
slaves
but
filled
they
must
be
by
some
one
and
in
free
society
half
of
its
members
are
employed
in
occupations
that
are
not
considered
or
treated
as
respectable
our
slaves
till
the

do
the
coarse
and
hard
labor
on
our
roads
and

sweep
our

our
food
brush
our
boots
wait
on
our
tables
hold
our
horses
do
all
hard
work
and
fill
all
menial
offices
your
freemen
at
the
north
do
the
same
work
and
fill
the
same
offices
the
only
difference
is
we
love
our
slaves
and
we
are
ready
to
defend
assist
and
protect
them
you
hate
and
fear
your
white
servants
and
never
fail
as
a
moral
duty
to
screw
down
their
wages
to
the
lowest
and
to
starve
their
families
if
possible
as

and

virtues
in

miscalled
freemen
fulfill
all
the
offices
of
slaves
for
less
wages
than
slaves
and
are
infinitely
less
liked
and

for
by
their

than

does
this
elevate
them
and
render
them

the
trades
the

the
occupations
that

does

except
what
his

make
but
you

more
than

you
take
the

you
make
more
money
from
our
cotton
and

and

and

and

and

and

we
make

you

from
which

and
in
which
to
sell

and
they
would
starve
at
once
you
live
by

it
elevates
your
whites
as
well
as
ours
by
confining
them
in
a
great
degree
to
skillful
light
and
intellectual
employments
and
it
feeds
and
clothes
them
abolish
slavery
and
you
will
suffer
vastly
more
than
we
because
we
have
all
the
lands
of
the
south
and
can
labor
as
you
do
and
a
genial
soil
and
climate
that
require
less
labor
but
while
in
the
absence
of
slavery
we
could
support
ourselves
we
should
cease

we
would

useless

private
property
destroys
liberty
and
equality
the
abolitionists
and
socialists
who
alone
have
explored
the
recesses
of
social
science
well
understand
that
they
can
never
establish
their
utopia
until
private
property
is
abolished
or
equalized
the
man
without
property
is
theoretically
and
too
often
practically
without
a
single
right
air
and
water
is
generally
believed
are
the
common
property
of
mankind
but
nothing
is
falser
in
fact
as
well
as
theory
the
ownership
of
land
gives
to
the
proprietor
the
exclusive
right
to
every
thing
above
and
beneath
the
soil
the
lands
are
all
appropriated
and
with
them
the
air
above
them
the
waters
on
them
and
the
mines
beneath
them
the
pauper
to
breathe
the
air
or
drink
the
waters
must
first
find
a
place
where
he
may
rightfully
enjoy
them
he
can
find
at
all
times
no
such
place
and
is
compelled
by
his
necessities
to
inhale
the
close
and
putrid
air
of
small
rooms
damp
cellars
and
crowded
factories
and
to
drink
insufficient
quantities
of
impure
water
furnished
to
him
at
a
price
he
can
ill
afford
he
pays
for
the
water
which
he
drinks
because
it
has
ceased
to
be
common
property
he
is
not
free
because
he
has
no
where
that
he
may
rightfully
lay
his
head
private
property
has
monopolized
the
earth
and
destroyed
both
his
liberty
and
equality
he
has
no
security
for
his
life
for
he
can
not
live
without
employment
and
adequate
wages
and
none
are
bound
to
employ
him
if
the
earth
were
in
common
he
could
always
enjoy
not
only
air
and
water
but
by
his
industry
might
earn
the
means
of
subsistence
his
situation
is
theoretically
and
practically
desperate
and
intolerable
were
he
a
slave
he
would
enjoy
in
fact
as
well
as
in
legal
fiction
all
necessary
and
essential
rights
pure
air
and
water
a
house
sufficient
food
fire
and
clothing
would
be
his
at
all
times
slavery
is
a
form
of
communism
and
as
the
abolitionists
and
socialists
have
resolved
to
adopt
a
new
social
system
we
recommend
it
to
their
consideration
the
manner
in
which
the
change
shall
be
made
from
the
present
form
of
society
to
that
system
of
communism
which
we
propose
is
very
simple
negro
slaves
are
now
worth
seven
hundred
dollars
as
whites
work
harder
they
are
worth
about
a
thousand
make
the
man
who
owns
a
thousand
dollars
of
capital
the
guardian
the
term
master
is
objectionable
of
one
white
pauper
of
average
value
give
the
man
who
is
worth
ten
thousand
dollars
ten
paupers
and
the
millionaire
a
thousand
this
would
be
an
act
of
simple
mercy
and
justice
for
the
capitalists
now
live
entirely
by
the
proceeds
of
poor
men
labor
which
capital
enables
them
to
command
and
they
command
and
enjoy
it
in
almost
the
exact
proportions
which
we
have
designated
thus
a
family
of
poor
laborers
men
women
and
children
ten
in
number
can
support
themselves
and
make
about
six
hundred
dollars
for
their
employer
which
is
the
interest
on
ten
thousand
they
would
work
no
harder
than
they
do
now
would
be
under
no
greater
necessity
to
work
would
be
relieved
of
most
of
the
cares
of
life
and
let
into
the
enjoyment
of
all
valuable
and
necessary
rights
what
would
they
lose
in
liberty
and
equality
just
nothing
having
more
rights
they
would
have
more
liberty
than
now
and
approach
nearer
to
equality
it
might
be
that
their
security
and
exemption
from
care
would
render
their
situation
preferable
to
that
of
their
employers
we
suspect
it
would
be
easier
to
find
wards
or
slaves
than
guardians
or
masters
for
the
gain
would
be
all
on
the
laborer
side
and
the
loss
all
on
that
of
the
capitalist
set
your
miscalled
free
laborers
actually
free
by
giving
them
enough
property
or
capital
to
live
on
and
then
call
on
us
at
the
south
to
free
our
negroes
at
present
you
abolitionists
know
our
negro
slaves
are
much
the
freer
of
the
two
and
it
would
be
a
great
advance
towards
freeing
your
laborers
to
give
them
guardians
bound
like
our
masters
to
take
care
of
them
and
entitled
in
consideration
thereof
to
the
proceeds
of
their
labor
chapter
xxix
the
national
era
an
excellent
witness
in
an
article
in
the
of
august
criticising
and
denying
our
theory
of
the
failure
of
free
society
the
writer
begins
by
asserting
we
demonstrated
last
week
from
history
that
the
condition
of
the
poor
of
england
has
greatly
improved
in
modern
times
as
they
have
become
free
from
the
restraints
of
feudal
bondage
he
then
goes
on
to
criticise
us
but
before
concluding
contradicts
and
refutes
his
work
of
the
week
before
and
adopts
our
theory
in
its
fullest
extent
he
admits
the
intolerable
exploitation
and
oppression
of
capital
over
labor
but
looks
forward
to
the
day
when
it
will
be
corrected
he
is
like
all
abolitionists
agrarian
he
holds
our
doctrine
too
that
the
serfs
were
set
free
to
starve
not
because
liberty
was
a
good
or
a
boon
he
further
holds
that
the
poor
laborers
could
not
get
masters
if
they
wanted
them
because
the
rich
can
get
their
labor
on
better
terms
thus
he
distinctly
shows
that
free
society
has
failed
and
why
it
has
failed
we
know
very
well
the
rich
of
western
europe
would
not
willingly
take
the
poor
as
slaves
but
the
law
should
compel
them
to
do
so
for
that
is
the
only
feasible
system
of
agrarianism
the
only
practicable
way
of
letting
in
all
men
to
a
sufficient
if
not
equal
enjoyment
of
terra
mater
here
is
his
refutation
of
himself
and
confirmation
of
our
theory
which
he
thinks
he
is
upsetting
we
never
take
up
an
abolition
paper
without
finding
doctrines
like
those
of
the
and
only
adduce
it
as
a
specimen
under
despotic
and
corrupt
governments
which
oppress
the
people
with
taxes
to
support
extravagant
misrule
and
unnecessary
war
which
debauch
them
by
evil
example
of
those
in
high
places
and
discourage
education
or
render
it
impossible
the
condition
of
the
poor
and
nominally
free
becomes
truly
deplorable
but
it
is
not
freedom
which
is
their
undoing
it
is
rather
the
lack
of
it
it
is
their
subjection
through
ignorance
to
bad
rulers
which
keeps
them
in
poverty
we
know
that
the
claim
laid
by
capital
to
the
lion
share
of
profits
is
itself
under
any
circumstances
a
great
obstruction
to
the
progress
of
the
masses
but
we
believe
that
even
that
obstacle
will
one
day
be
removed
that
problem
in
political
science
be
solved
by
civilization
and
christianity
we
believe
that
the
human
intellect
will
never
with
the
light
of
the
gospel
to
guide
and
inspire
its
efforts
surrender
to
the
cold
and
heartless
reign
of
capital
over
labor
but
at
any
rate
one
thing
is
certain
under
the
worst
form
of
government
or
the
best
namely
when
freedom
becomes
a
burden
and
a
curse
to
the
poor
slavery
that
is
to
say
the
enslavement
of
the
mass
of
laborers
with
responsibility
on
the
part
of
the
master
for
their
support
is
no
longer
possible
when
freemen
are
unable
to
support
themselves
among
all
the
diversified
employments
of
free
societies
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
find
masters
willing
to
take
the
responsibility
the
masses
in
europe
in
fact
owe
their
liberty
to
the
excessive
supply
of
slave
labor
which
when
it
becomes
a
burden
to
the
land
was
cast
aside
as
worthless
who
believes
that
irish
landlords
would
take
the
responsibility
of
supporting
the
peasantry
on
the
condition
of
their
becoming
slaves
in
fact
is
it
not
notorious
that
they
help
them
to
emigrate
to
america
and
often
pull
down
their
cabins
and
huts
in
order
to
drive
them
off
in
further
proof
of
the
agrarian
doctrines
of
the
abolitionists
we
add
an
article
from
the
christian
a
clever
methodist
paper
edited
in
the
state
of
new
york
factory
there
is
a
class
of
laborers
consisting
of
men
women
and
children
whom
we
never
contemplate
but
with
regret
we
see
them
at
least
in
imagination
subsiding
in
spite
of
all
their
care
into
utter
dependence
and
poverty
hence
we
never
look
upon
a
factory
or
large
manufacturing
establishment
with
unmingled
pleasure
the
men
and
women
who
ply
its
machinery
are
too
apt
to
become
identified
with
such
establishments
in
an
improper
degree
this
process
of
assimilation
and
identification
goes
on
slowly
but
surely
till
at
last
the
individual
and
the
factory
are
so
blended
into
one
that
a
separate
existence
is
impossible
one
or
two
generations
are
required
to
bring
about
this
state
of
things
pecuniary
dependence
ignorance
of
other
employments
physical
malformation
and
the
general
helplessness
of
a
mere
factory
population
are
not
the
work
of
a
day
individuals
can
not
be
detached
from
other
pursuits
at
once
can
not
have
manufacturing
knowledge
and
no
other
knowledge
until
they
have
had
time
to
drift
away
from
other
occupations
but
however
retarded
the
effect
it
is
sure
to
follow
and
consequently
every
large
mechanical
establishment
must
be
considered
as
having
certain
malign
tendencies
which
are
to
be
carefully
guarded
against
the
causes
of
the
evil
under
consideration
are
very
obvious
as
is
also
their
appropriate
remedy
we
must
set
down
as
the
first
and
principal
cause
of
injury
the
fact
that
the
capital
which
sustains
mechanical
business
is
not
under
the
control
of
the
operatives
the
mills
or
machines
may
stop
at
any
hour
in
spite
of
the
wants
or
wishes
of
the
employees
wages
may
be
put
down
little
or
much
with
or
without
notice
operatives
are
not
consulted
in
such
cases
the
motive
may
be
good
or
bad
it
may
be
to
guard
against
bankruptcy
or
to
amass
wealth
from
the
sinews
of
a
toiling
dependent
race
but
whatever
the
motive
and
the
decision
the
operative
is
helpless
he
can
control
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
it
is
his
to
labor
others
are
charged
with
the
regulation
of
prices
and
the
only
check
in
his
power
is
the
precarious
one
of
a
strikes
in
business
are
like
insurrections
in
civil
governments
a
last
desperate
remedy
and
as
often
fatal
to
the
sufferer
as
protective
of
his
interests
the
same
is
true
of
the
farmer
who
does
not
own
the
soil
on
which
he
labors
but
is
compelled
to
make
terms
with
a
landlord
hence
the
well
known
insurmountable
evils
of
agricultural
tenantry
in
europe
it
has
produced
serfdom
and
feudalism
besides
a
good
deal
of
servitude
and
degradation
concealed
under
the
mild
name
of
peasant
it
matters
not
what
the
occupation
may
be
as
soon
as
the
laborer
becomes
thoroughly
dependent
and
feels
that
dependence
the
system
does
him
an
incalculable
injury
it
is
for
this
reason
that
large
landholders
always
deteriorate
the
population
and
society
becomes
worthless
just
in
proportion
as
the
means
of
independent
existence
pass
from
the
hands
of
the
many
to
the
few
this
difficulty
is
and
must
be
forever
in
the
way
of
conducting
manufacturing
establishments
on
the
present
plan
perhaps
some
means
of
diffusing
capital
among
operatives
or
what
is
the
same
of
giving
the
laborer
reasonable
securities
may
yet
be
discovered
but
the
change
would
require
to
be
radical
the
monopoly
of
capital
is
so
nearly
like
the
monopoly
of
land
that
we
may
readily
see
no
partial
measures
can
ever
effect
a
cure

are
unknown
at
the

the
exploitation
or
unjust
exactions
of
skill
and
capital
in
free
society
excite
the
learned
and
philanthropic
to
devise
schemes
of
escape
and
impel
the
laborers
to
adopt
those
schemes
however
chimerical
because
they
feel
that
their
situation
can
not
be
worsted
they
are
already
slaves
without
masters
and
that
is
the
bathos
of
human
misery
besides
universal
liberty
has
disintegrated
and
dissolved
society
and
placed
men
in
isolated
selfish
and
antagonistic
positions
in
which
each
man
is
compelled
to
wrong
others
in
order
to
be
just
to
himself
but
man
nature
is
social
not
selfish
and
he
longs
and
yearns
to
return
to
parental
fraternal
and
associative
relations
all
the
isms
concur
in
promising
closer
and
more
associative
relations
in
establishing
at
least
a
qualified
community
of
property
and
in
insuring
the
weak
and
unfortunate
the
necessaries
and
comforts
of
life
indeed
they
all
promise
to
establish
slavery
minus
the
master
and
the
overseer
as
the
evils
which
we
have
described
are
little
felt
at
the
south
men
here
would
as
soon
think
of
entering
the
lion
cage
as
going
into
one
of
their
incestuous
establishments
mormonism
is
only
a
monster
development
of
the
isms
they
are
all
essentially
alike
and
that
the
most
successful
because
so
far
it
has
been
socialism
plus
the
overseer
the
mantle
of
joe
smith
descended
on
brigham
young
and
if
he
transmit
to
a
true
prophet
there
is
no
telling
how
long
the
thing
may
work
mormonism
had
its
birth
in
western
new
york
that
land
fertile
of
isms
where
also
arose
spiritual
rappings
and
oneida
perfectionism
where
shakers
and
millenarians
and
millerites
abound
and
all
heresies
do
most
flourish
mormonism
now
is
daily
gathering
thousands
of
recruits
from
free
society
in
europe
asia
africa
and
our
north
and
not
one
from
the
south
it
has
no
religion
but
in
place
of
it
a
sensual
moral
code
that
shocks
the
common
sense
of
propriety
but
it
holds
property
somewhat
in
common
draws
men
together
in
closer
and
more
fraternal
relations
and
promises
probably
falsely
a
safe
retreat
and
refuge
from
the
isolated
and
inimical
relations
the
killing
competition
and
exploitation
of
free
society
all
the
other
isms
do
the
same
but
or
the
want
of
a
master
soon
explodes
them
we
saw
last
year
an
advertisement
under
the
hammer
of
the
last
of
fourteen
phalansteries
established
at
the

on
the

but
andrews
who
is
an
expert
informs
us
that
they
like
the
mormons
have
a
despotic
head
socialism
with
such
despotic
head
approaches
very
near
to
southern
slavery
and
gets
along
very
well

deficiency
of
food
in
free
society
the
normal
state
of
free
society
is
a
state
of
famine
agricultural
labor
is
the
most
arduous
least
respectable
and
worst
paid
of
all
labor
nature
and
philosophy
teach
all
who
can
to
avoid
and
escape
from
it
and
to
pursue
less
laborious
more
respectable
and
more
lucrative
employments
none
work
in
the
field
who
can
help
it
hence
free
society
is
in
great
measure
dependent
for
its
food
and
clothing
on
slave
society
western
europe
and
new
england
get
their
cotton
sugar
and
much
of
their
bread
and
meat
from
the
south
from
cuba
russia
poland
and
turkey
after
all
the
mass
of
their
population
suffers
continual
physical
want
mcculloch
informs
us
in
his
edition
of
adam
smith
that
the
better
sort
of
irish
laborers
eat
meat
once
a
month
or
once
in
six
months
the
lowest
order
never
the
better
class
of
english
laborers
eat
meat
twice
or
three
times
a
week
now
no
southern
negro
would
believe
this
if
you
were
to
swear
to
it
yet
it
is
a
very
favorable
account
of
those
laborers
the
irish
rarely
eat
bread
and
the
english
peasantry
have
wholly
inadequate
allowance
of
it
on
the
continent
the
peasantry
generally
live
on
fruits
nuts
and
olives
and
other
things
which
our
slaves
do
not
seek
as
food
at
all
but
as
mere
condiments
to
give
a
relish
to
their
meat
and
bread
agriculture
is
the
proper
pursuit
of
slaves
to
be
superintended
and
directed
however
by
freemen
its
profits
are
inadequate
to
the
support
of
separate
families
of
laborers
especially
of
white
laborers
in
cold
climates
whose
wants
are
greater
than
those
of
negroes
at
the
south
the
expenses
of
families
are
greatly
lessened
where
slavery
associates
a
large
number
under
a
common
head
or
master
and
their
labor
is
rendered
more
efficient
and
productive
this
is
the
great
idea
of
the
socialists
and
it
is
a
truer
one
than
the
doctrine
of
the
political
economists
free
society
is
in
great
measure
fed
and
clothed
by
slave
society
which
it
pays
for
in
worthless
baubles
fashionable
trifles
and
deleterious
luxuries
without
which
slave
society
would
do
much
better
every
one
should
study
the
census
of
the
union
in
order
to
see
how
dependent
the
is
on
slave
labor
and
how
trifling
are
her
agricultural
products
the
profits
of
slave
farming
enure
chiefly
to
the
advantage
of
western
europe
and
our
north
practical
men
therefore
at
the
north
so
far
from
going
to
work
to
abolish
slavery
are
bringing
daily
a
larger
supply
of
slaves
into
the
slave
market
than
ever
was
brought
before
add
the
coolies
of
asia
and
apprentices
from
africa
to
the
old
negro
slave
trade
and
the
annual
supply
of
new
slaves
exceeds
by
far
that
of
any
other
period
the
abolitionists
will
probably
succeed
in
dissolving
the
union
in
involving
us
in
civil
and
fratricidal
war
and
in
cutting
off
the
north
from
its
necessary
supply
of
food
and
clothing
but
they
should
recollect
that
whilst
they
are
engaged
in
this
labor
of
love
northern
and
english
merchants
are
rapidly
extending
and
increasing
slavery
by
opening
daily
new
markets
for
the
purchase
and
sale
of
coolies
apprentices
and
africans
the
foreign
slave
trade
is
not
necessary
for
the
supply
of
the
slave
markets
the
increase
of
the
present
slaves
if
humanely
treated
would
suffice
to
meet
that
demand
but
africans
and
coolies
cost
less
than
the
rearing
of
slaves
in
america
and
the
trade
in
them
whenever
carried
on
induces
masters
to
work
their
old
slaves
to
death
and
buy
new
ones
from
abroad
the
foreign
slave
trade
especially
the
cooley
trade
is
the
most
inhuman
pursuit
in
which
man
ever
engaged
equally
inhuman
to
the
victims
which
it
imports
and
to
the
old
slaves
whose
treatment
and
condition
it
renders
intolerably
cruel
by
directing
philanthropy
and
public
opinion
in
a
false
direction
the
abolitionists
have
become
the
most
efficient
propagandists
of
slavery
and
the
slave
trade
and
slavery
such
as
it
exists
in
pursuance
of
the
foreign
slave
trade
shocks
our
sense
of
humanity
quite
as
much
as
that
of
the
most
sensitive
abolitionists
since
writing
thus
far
we
met
with
the
following
in
the
charleston
mercury
wheat
in
the
deficiency
in
the
production
of
wheat
in
massachusetts
alone
in
for
the
consumption
of
her
inhabitants
was
bushels
and
of
indian
corn
bushels
allowing
any
thing
for
the
consumption
of
corn
by
in
the
deficiency
in
the
production
of
wheat
in
all
the
new
england
states
was
equal
to
barrels
of
flour
and
to
bushels
of
corn
allowing
any
thing
for
the
consumption
by
this
is
barrels
more
than
was
exported
of
domestic
flour
from
all
of
the
united
states
to
foreign
countries
during
the
year
ending
june
and
more
barrels
than
was
exported
both
of
domestic
and
foreign
flour
from
the
united
states
for
the
same
period
we
conclude
from
our
examination
of
the
census
that
the
grain
and
potatoes
made
in
new
england
would
about
feed
her
cattle
horses
hogs
and
sheep
leaving
none
for
her
inhabitants
we
lately
compared
carefully
the
census
of
massachusetts
and
north
carolina
and
found
in
round
numbers
that
according
to
population
north
carolina
produced
annually
ten
times
as
much
of
human
food
as
massachusetts
but
that
massachusetts
balanced
the
account
by
producing
annually
ten
times
as
many
paupers
and
criminals
as
north
carolina
we
also
discover
that
the
want
of
food
in
the
one
state
and
its
abundance
in
the
other
tells
on
the
duration
of
human
life
the
mortality
in
massachusetts
is
nearly
double
that
in
north
carolina
we
infer
that
there
is
ten
times
as
much
of
human
happiness
in
north
carolina
as
in
massachusetts
the
census
gives
no
account
of
the
infidels
and
the
isms
of
them
there
are
none
in
north
carolina
and
massachusetts
may
boast
that
she
rivals
germany
france
and
western
new
york
in
their
production
really
it
is
suicidal
folly
in
new
england
to
talk
of
disunion
and
setting
up
for
herself
she
does
not
possess
the
elements
of
separate
nationality
she
is
intelligent
and
wealthy
but
her
wealth
is
cosmopolitan
her
poverty
indigenous
her
commerce
her
manufactures
and
moneyed
capital
constitute
her
wealth
disunion
would
make
these
useless
and
unprofitable
at
home
and
they
would
be
transferred
immediately
to
other
states
and
nations
north
carolina
might
well
set
up
for
herself
for
she
can
produce
all
the
necessaries
and
comforts
and
luxuries
of
life
within
herself
and
has
virginia
between
herself
and
danger
on
the
one
side
and
an
inaccessible
sea
coast
on
the
other
but
we
of
virginia
being
a
border
state
would
be
badly
situated
in
case
of
disunion
and
mean
to
cling
to
it
as
long
as
honor
permits
besides
virginia
loves
her

not
bear

in

of

we
observe
that

narrows
down
the

contest
to
the
mere
question
whether

may
rightfully
hold

in

we
think
we
can
dispose
of

and
all
such

higher

slavery
arises
under
the
higher
law
and
is
and
ever
must
be
coëval
and
coëxtensive
with
human
nature
we
will
enumerate
a
few
of
its
ten
thousand
modifications
the
husband
has
a
legally
recognized
property
in
his

services
and
may
legally
control
in
some
measure
her

she
is
his

and
his

the
wife
has
also
a
legally
recognized
property
in
the

he
is
her
property
but
not
her
slave
the
father
has
property
in
the
services
and
persons
of
his
children
till
they
are
years
of

they
are
his

and
his

children

in
the

of
each
parent
infant
negroes
sick
infirm
and
superannuated
negroes
hold
most
valuable
property
in
the
services
and
capital
of
their

the
masters
hold
no
property
in
such
slaves
because
for
the
time
they
are
of
no
value
owners
and
captains
of
vessels
own
property
in
the

and

they
the

for
such

the

he
is
not

like
the

because
although
the

his

very
different

the

bestows
on

in

in

we

whether

hence

this

the
coup
de
grace
to
abolition
the
abolitionists
are
all
willing
to
admit
that
free
society
has
utterly
failed
in
europe
but
will
assign
two
reasons
for
that
failure
excess
of
population
and
want
of
equality
and
liberty
were
the
population
of
england
doubled
the
labor
required
to
support
that
population
would
be
lessened
could
all
labor
and
expenses
be
supported
alike
because
the
association
and
division
of
labor
might
be
rendered
more
perfect
and
the
expenses
of
a
single
family
or
single
individual
might
be
divided
among
and
borne
by
many
the
socialists
and
abolitionists
understand
this
when
one
family
has
to
support
its
own
school
its
own
mill
its
own
mechanics
its
own
doctor
parson
living
is
expensive
but
where
these
and
other
expenses
are
divided
among
many
living
becomes
cheap
hence
it
is
far
less
laborious
to
live
in
a
densely
settled
country
than
in
a
sparsely
settled
one
if
labor
and
expenses
can
be
equally
divided
the
soil
of
england
will
readily
support
double
its
population
if
its
products
be
not
wasted
in
luxury
in
feeding
deer
and
game
and
horses
england
has
not
attained
that
density
of
population
which
enables
men
to
live
by
the
least
amount
of
labor
her
laboring
population
has
been
thinned
and
labor
rendered
dearer
and
scarcer
by
emigration
of
late
years
to
america
california
and
australia
yet
in
the
winter
of
there
was
a
general
outbreak
and
riot
of
her
operatives
because
a
fall
in
prices
occasioned
a
large
number
of
her
factories
to
stop
work
and
turn
their
hands
out
of
employment
this
happens
every
day
in
free
society
from
the
bankruptcy
of
employers
or
from
the
glut
of
markets
and
fall
of
prices
we
will
add
that
a
meeting
of
the
working
men
of
new
york
in
the
park
asserted
that
there
were
working
men
and
women
in
that
city
out
of
employment
last
winter
the
competitive
system
so
injurious
to
the
laboring
class
is
carried
out
with
less
exception
or
restriction
in
america
than
in
europe
hence
considering
the
sparseness
of
our
population
the
laboring
class
are
worse
off
in
new
york
philadelphia
and
boston
than
in
london
manchester
or
paris
and
this
begets
more
socialists
in
the
higher
classes
and
more
mobs
riots
and
with
the
laborers
than
in
europe
finally
if
it
be
excess
of
numbers
or
want
of
liberty
that
occasions
the
failure
of
free
society
why
are
our
abolitionists
and
socialists
so
hot
and
so
active
in
upsetting
and
society
they
have
pronounced
with
entire
unanimity
that
free
society
is
intolerable
whether
a
country
be
densely
or
sparsely
settled
the
abolitionists
boast
that
lands
are
dearer
and
labor
cheaper
in
free
than
in
slave
society
either
proposition
contains
the
admission
that
free
laborers
work
more
for
others
and
less
for
themselves
than
slaves
in
effect
that
they
are
less
free
than
slaves
the
profits
of
land
are
what
the
appropriates
of
the
results
of
work
of
the
laborer
where
he
appropriates
most
and
leaves
the
laborer
least
there
lands
are
dearest
labor
cheapest
and
laborers
least
free
in
europe
lands
sell
much
higher
than
at
the
north
hence
laborers
are
less
free
in
fact
than
at
the
north
in
the
north
they
sell
higher
than
in
the
south
because
the
slaves
consume
more
of
the
results
of
their
own
labor
than
laborers
at
the
north
and
leave
less
profit
to
the
the
high
price
of
land
is
in
the
general
an
unerring
indication
of
the
poverty
and
actual
slavery
of
the
laboring
class
its
low
price
equally
proves
that
the
laborers
whether
called
slaves
or
freemen
work
more
for
themselves
and
less
for
the
than
where
lands
are
dear
in
settled
countries
where
all
the
lands
are
appropriated
this
theory
is
undeniable
and
irrefutable
as
this
is
a
short
chapter
we
take
the
opportunity
to
apologize
and
account
for
our
discursive
immethodical
and
unartistic
manner
in
the
first
place
the
character
of
the
enemy
we
have
to
contend
with
prevents
anything
like
regular
warfare
they
are
divided
into
hundreds
of
little
guerrilla
bands
of
isms
each
having
its
peculiar
partizan
tactics
and
we
are
compelled
to
vary
our
mode
of
attack
from
regular
cannonade
to
to
suit
the
occasion
again
we
practiced
as
a
jury
lawyer
for
years
and
thereby
acquired
an
inveterate
habit
of
cumulation
and
iteration
and
of
various
argument
and
illustration
but
at
the
same
time
we
learned
how
to
make
out
our
case
and
to
know
when
it
is
made
out
the
lawyer
who
observed
the
unities
in
an
argument
before
a
jury
would
be
sure
to
lose
his
cause
and
now
the
world
is
our
jury
who
are
going
to
bring
in
a
verdict
against
free
society
of
guilty
we
admire
not
the
pellucid
rivulet
that
murmurs
and
meanders
in
cramped
and
artificial
current
through
the
park
and
gardens
of
the
nobleman
but
we
do
admire
the
flooded
and
swollen
mississippi
whose
turbid
waters
in
their
majestic
course
sweep
along
upon
their
bosom
with
equal
composure
the
occupants
of
the
and
the
poultry
yard
the
flocks
the
herds
the
crops
the
uprooted
forest
and
the
residences
of
man
the
exhaustive
not
the
artistic
is
what
we
would
aspire
to
and
yet
the
exhaustive
may
be
the
highest
art
of
argument
the
best
mode
we
think
of
writing
is
that
in
which
facts
and
argument
and
rhetoric
and
wit
and
sarcasm
succeed
each
other
with
rapid
iteration
intonuere
poli
et
crebris
micat
ignibus
æther
again
artistic
execution
is
it
neither
suits
their
minds
nor
their
tastes
discursiveness
and
prurient
exuberancy
of
thought
and
suggestion
they
often
possess
but
always
fail
when
they
attempt
a
literary
or
other
work
of
art
indeed
we
have
a
strong
suspicion
that
art
went
out
of
the
world
about
the
time
the
baconian
philosophy
came
in
a
continuous
argument
without
pause
or
break
on
a
subject
profoundly
metaphysical
equally
fatigues
the
writer
and
the
reader
nobody
likes
it
and
very
few
read
it
desipere
in
loco
is
not
only
a
very
agreeable
maxim
to
the
author
but
a
very
wise
and
prudent
one
lastly
like
porthos
when
we
have
an
idea
we
are
at
once
seized
with
a
feverish
anxiety
to
communicate
it
and
we
think
it
better
to
break
in
on
the
regular
thread
of
our
discourse
and
do
so
at
once
than
to
spoil
our
whole
discourse
by
having
our
minds
occupied
with
two
subjects
at
a
time
another
idea
strikes
us
as
yet
we
hardly
aspire
to
the
dignity
of
authorship
we
indulge
in
abandon
because
as
a
writer
we
have
no
reputation
to
jeopard
or
to
lose
but
should
this
book
take
we
will
mount
the
antithetical
stilts
of
auctorial
dignity
write
a
book
as
stale
and
dry
as
the
remainder
biscuit
after
a
long
voyage
and
as
free
from
originality
wit
thought
or
suggestiveness
as
the
speech
the
president
message
or
a
debate
in
the
united
states
senate
we
do
not
as
yet
bore
the
world
with
respectable
stupidity
because
our
position
does
not
authorize
it
chapter
xxxiv
national
wealth
individual
wealth
luxury
and
economy
it
is
a
common
theory
with
political
economists
that
national
wealth
is
but
the
sum
of
individual
wealth
and
that
as
individual
wealth
increases
national
wealth
increases
we
think
this
theory
false
and
pernicious
and
the
more
so
because
it
is
plausible
all
possessions
or
capital
tend
to
exonerate
their
owners
from
labor
and
to
throw
the
labor
that
supports
society
on
a
part
only
of
its
members
now
as
almost
all
wealth
is
the
product
of
labor
this
diminution
of
labor
diminishes
wealth
or
at
least
increases
poverty
by
placing
heavier
burdens
on
the
laboring
class
this
however
is
a
very
small
part
of
the
evil
effects
of
individual
wealth
society
requires
it
of
the
rich
to
live
according
to
their
income
to
fare
sumptuously
to
have
costly
dress
furniture
equipage
houses
and
to
keep
many
servants
their
incomes
are
spent
in
luxuries
and
thousands
of
laborers
are
taken
off
from
the
production
of
necessaries
to
produce
those
luxuries
or
to
wait
on
their
owners
thus
the
burden
of
the
support
of
society
so
far
as
the
ordinary
comforts
and
necessaries
of
life
are
concerned
are
thrown
on
fewer
and
fewer
as
private
wealth
and
luxury
increase
it
requires
a
thousand
pauper
laborers
to
sustain
one
millionaire
and
without
them
his
capital
will
produce
no
profit
this
accounts
for
the
great
numbers
and
excessive
poverty
of
the
mass
in
england
half
the
boasted
capital
of
england
probably
of
it
is
but
a
mortgage
of
the
bones
and
sinews
of
the
laborers
now
and
forever
to
the
capitalists
the
national
debt
stocks
of
all
kinds
money
at
interest
and
indeed
all
debts
represent
this
sort
of
private
wealth
which
is
national
poverty
sumptuous
houses
parks
and
all
establishments
that
are
costly
to
sustain
and
keep
up
and
do
not
facilitate
but
check
the
production
of
necessaries
are
also
part
of
private
wealth
and
of
national
poverty
of
the
private
wealth
of
england
and
half
of
that
of
our
northeast
is
a
severe
tax
on
labor
and
a
constant
preventive
of
the
accumulation
of
national
wealth
private
wealth
at
the
south
consists
chiefly
in
negro
laborers
and
improvements
of
land
that
increase
its
productive
capacities
fine
enclosures
improved
stock
good
granaries
and
machines
and
implements
for
farming
comfortable
negro
cabins
good
orchards
are
as
strictly
a
part
of
national
as
of
individual
wealth
not
so
with
the
costly
private
dwellings
in
our
northern
cities
the
expense
of
building
of
repairing
of
furnishing
and
of
keeping
servants
for
their
owners
or
tenants
is
a
constant
drawback
from
productive
industry
increases
the
burdens
of
the
laboring
poor
and
diminishes
national
wealth
the
fields
of
new
england
are
the
necessary
consequence
of
the
luxurious
expenditure
in
her
cities
yet
that
luxury
is
no
part
of
national
wealth
but
a
constant
tax
on
it
whilst
unproved
farms
constitute
almost
of
all
her
real
wealth
for
they
feed
and
clothe
mankind
this
is
a
most
interesting
subject
one
which
we
have
not
mastered
or
if
we
had
this
work
on
which
we
are
engaged
is
not
the
proper
one
for
its
full
discussion
and
exposition
we
merely
throw
out
a
few
suggestions
for
the
consideration
of
the
thinking
and
ingenuous
if
we
are
right
luxury
is
the
greatest
sin
against
society
economy
and
industry
the
chiefest
of
social
virtues
chapter
xxxv
government
a
thing
of
force
not
of
consent
we
do
not
agree
with
the
authors
of
the
declaration
of
independence
that
governments
derive
their
just
powers
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
the
women
the
children
the
negroes
and
but
few
of
the
holders
were
consulted
or
consented
to
the
revolution
or
the
governments
that
ensued
from
its
success
as
to
these
the
new
governments
were
despotisms
and
the
governing
class
despots
those
governments
originated
in
force
and
have
been
continued
by
force
all
governments
must
originate
in
force
and
be
continued
by
force
the
very
term
government
implies
that
it
is
carried
on
against
the
consent
of
the
governed
fathers
do
not
derive
their
authority
as
heads
of
families
from
the
consent
of
wife
and
children
nor
do
they
govern
their
families
by
their
consent
they
never
take
the
vote
of
the
family
as
to
the
labors
to
be
performed
the
moneys
to
be
expended
or
as
to
anything
else
masters
dare
not
take
the
vote
of
slaves
as
to
their
government
if
they
did
constant
holiday
dissipation
and
extravagance
would
be
the
result
captains
of
ships
are
not
appointed
by
the
consent
of
the
crew
and
never
take
their
vote
even
in
doubling
cape
horn
if
they
did
the
crew
would
generally
vote
to
get
drunk
and
the
ship
would
never
weather
the
cape
not
even
in
the
most
democratic
countries
are
soldiers
governed
by
their
consent
nor
is
their
vote
taken
on
the
eve
of
battle
they
have
some
how
lost
or
never
had
the
inalienable
rights
of
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
and
whether
americans
or
russians
are
forced
into
battle
without
and
often
against
their
consent
the
ancient
republics
were
governed
by
a
small
class
of
adult
male
citizens
who
assumed
and
exercised
the
government
without
the
consent
of
the
governed
the
south
is
governed
just
as
those
ancient
republics
were
in
the
county
in
which
we
live
there
are
eighteen
thousand
souls
and
only
twelve
hundred
voters
but
we
twelve
hundred
the
governors
never
asked
and
never
intend
to
ask
the
consent
of
the
sixteen
thousand
eight
hundred
whom
we
govern
were
we
to
do
so
we
should
soon
have
an
organized
anarchy
the
governments
of
europe
could
not
exist
a
week
without
the
positive
force
of
standing
armies
they
are
all
governments
of
force
not
of
consent
even
in
our
north
the
women
children
and
free
negroes
constitute
of
the
population
and
they
are
all
governed
without
their
consent
but
they
mean
to
correct
this
gross
and
glaring
iniquity
at
the
north
they
hold
that
all
men
women
and
negroes
and
smart
children
are
equals
and
entitled
to
equal
rights
the
widows
and
free
negroes
begin
to
vote
in
some
of
those
states
and
they
will
have
to
let
all
colors
and
sexes
and
ages
vote
soon
or
give
up
the
glorious
principles
of
human
equality
and
universal
emancipation
the
experiment
which
they
will
make
we
fear
is
absurd
in
theory
and
the
symptoms
of
approaching
anarchy
and
agrarianism
among
them
leave
no
doubt
that
its
practical
operation
will
be
no
better
than
its
theory
ism
and
all
the
other
isms
are
but
the
spattering
drops
that
precede
a
social
deluge
abolition
ultimates
in
consent
government
consent
government
in
anarchy
free
love
agrarianism
and
despotism
winds
up
the
play
if
the
interests
of
the
governors
or
governing
class
be
not
conservative
they
certainly
will
not
conserve
institutions
injurious
to
their
interests
there
never
was
and
never
can
be
an
old
society
in
which
the
immediate
interests
of
a
majority
of
human
souls
do
not
conflict
with
all
established
order
all
right
of
property
and
all
existing
institutions
immediate
interest
is
all
the
mass
look
to
and
they
would
be
sure
to
revolutionize
government
as
often
as
the
situation
of
the
majority
was
worse
than
that
of
the
minority
divide
all
property
and
a
year
hence
the
inequalities
of
property
would
provoke
a
in
the
south
the
interest
of
the
governing
class
is
eminently
conservative
and
the
south
is
fast
becoming
the
most
conservative
of
nations
already
at
the
north
government
vibrates
and
oscillates
between
radicalism
and
conservatism
at
present
radicalism
or
black
republicanism
is
in
the
ascendant
the
number
of
paupers
is
rapidly
increasing
radical
and
agrarian
doctrines
are
spreading
the
women
and
the
children
and
the
negroes
will
soon
be
let
in
to
vote
and
then
they
will
try
the
experiment
of
consent
government
and
constituted
anarchy
it
is
falsely
said
that
revolutions
never
go
backwards
they
always
go
backwards
and
generally
farther
back
than
where
they
started
the
social
revolution
now
going
on
at
the
north
must
some
day
go
backwards
shall
it
do
so
now
ere
it
has
perpetrated
an
infinitude
of
mischief
shed
oceans
of
blood
and
occasioned
endless
human
misery
or
will
the
conservatives
of
the
north
let
it
run
the
length
of
its
leather
inflict
all
these
evils
and
then
rectify
itself
by
issuing
into
military
despotism
we
think
that
by
a
kind
of
alliance
offensive
and
defensive
with
the
south
northern
conservatism
may
now
arrest
and
turn
back
the
tide
of
radicalism
and
agrarianism
we
will
not
presume
to
point
out
the
whole
means
and
modus
operandi
they
on
the
field
of
action
will
best
see
what
is
necessary
to
be
done
whilst
we
hold
that
all
government
is
a
matter
of
force
we
yet
think
the
governing
class
should
be
numerous
enough
to
understand
and
so
situated
as
to
represent
fairly
all
interests
the
greek
and
roman
masters
were
thus
situated
so
were
the
old
barons
of
england
and
so
are
the
white
citizens
of
the
south
if
not
all
masters
like
greek
and
roman
citizens
they
all
belong
to
the
master
race
have
exclusive
rights
and
privileges
of
citizenship
and
an
interest
not
to
see
this
right
of
citizenship
extended
disturbed
and
rendered
worthless
and
contemptible
whilst
the
governments
of
europe
are
more
obviously
kept
alive
and
conducted
by
force
than
at
any
other
period
yet
are
they
all
from
necessity
watchful
and
regardful
of
public
opinion
opinion
now
rules
the
world
but
not
as
expressed
through
the
governments
become
more
popular
as
they
become
more
forcible
a
large
governing
class
is
not
apt
to
mistake
or
disregard
opinion
and
therefore
republican
institutions
are
best
adapted
to
the
times
under
monarchical
forms
the
governments
of
europe
are
daily
becoming
more
republican
the
fatal
error
committed
in
western
europe
is
the
wielding
of
government
by
a
class
who
govern
but
do
not
represent
the
masses
their
interests
and
those
of
the
masses
are
antagonistic
whilst
those
of
masters
and
slaves
are
identical
looking
to
theory
to
the
examples
of
the
ancient
republics
and
to
england
under
the
plantagenets
we
shall
find
that
southern
institutions
are
far
the
best
now
existing
in
the
world
we
think
speculations
as
to
constructing
governments
are
little
worth
for
all
government
is
the
gradual
accretion
of
nature
time
and
circumstances
yet
these
theories
have
occurred
to
us
and
as
they
are
conservative
we
will
suggest
them
in
slaveholding
countries
all
freemen
should
vote
and
govern
because
their
interests
are
conservative
in
free
states
the
government
should
be
in
the
hands
of
the
who
are
also
conservative
a
system
of
primogeniture
and
entails
of
small
parcels
of
land
might
in
a
great
measure
identify
the
interests
of
all
or
at
least
those
who
held
no
lands
would
generally
be
the
children
and
kinsmen
of
those
who
did
and
be
taken
care
of
by
them
the
frequent
accumulation
of
large
fortunes
and
consequent
pauperism
of
the
masses
is
the
greatest
evil
of
modern
society
would
not
small
entails
prevent
this
all
can
not
own
lands
but
as
many
should
own
them
as
is
consistent
with
good
farming
and
advanced
civilization
the
social
institutions
of
the
jews
as
established
by
moses
and
joshua
most
nearly
fulfill
our
ideas
of
perfect
government
a
word
at
parting
to
northern
conservatives
a
like
danger
threatens
north
and
south
proceeding
from
the
same
source
abolitionism
is
maturing
what
political
economy
began
with
inexorable
sequence
let
alone
is
made
to
usher
in
north
and
south
our
danger
is
the
same
and
our
remedies
though
differing
in
degree
must
in
character
be
the
same
let
alone
must
be
repudiated
if
we
would
have
any
government
we
must
in
all
sections
act
upon
the
principle
that
the
world
is
too
little
governed
you
of
the
north
need
not
institute
negro
slavery
far
less
reduce
white
men
to
the
state
of
negro
slavery
but
the
masses
require
more
of
protection
and
the
masses
and
philosophers
equally
require
more
of
control
leave
it
to
time
and
circumstances
to
suggest
the
necessary
legislation
but
rely
upon
it
anarchy
plus
the
street
constable
wont
answer
any
longer
the
vigilance
committee
of
california
is
but
a
mob
rendered
necessary
by
the
inadequacy
of
the
regular
government
it
is
the
vis
medicatrix
naturæ
vainly
attempting
to
discharge
the
office
of
physician
that
country
is
too
little
governed
where
the
best
and
most
conservative
citizens
have
to
resolve
themselves
into
mobs
and
vigilance
committees
to
protect
rights
which
government
should
but
dues
not
protect
the
element
of
force
exists
probably
in
too
small
a
degree
in
our
federal
government
it
has
neither
territory
nor
subjects
kansas
is
better
off
for
she
has
a
few
citizens
and
a
large
and
fertile
territory
she
is
backing
the
government
out
if
not
whipping
her
massachusetts
too
has
nullified
her
laws
utah
contemns
her
authority
and
the
vigilance
committee
of
california
sets
her
at
successful
defiance
she
is
an
attempt
at
a
government
without
territory
or
citizens
considered
and
treated
as
a
league
or
treaty
between
or
she
may
yet
have
a
long
and
useful
existence
for
then
those
or
seeing
that
she
has
no
means
of
or
may
for
their
mutual
interests
combine
to
sustain
and
defend
her
heretofore
domestic
weakness
and
danger
from
foreign
foes
has
combined
the
states
in
sustaining
the
union
hereafter
the
great
advantages
of
friendly
and
mutual
intercourse
trade
and
exchanges
may
continue
to
produce
a
like
result
but
the
prospects
are
alarming
and
it
is
well
that
all
patriots
should
know
that
the
union
has
little
power
to
sustain
and
perpetuate
itself
there
are
three
kinds
of
force
that
occur
to
us
will
sustain
a
government
first
inside
necessity
such
as
slavery
that
occasions
a
few
to
usurp
power
and
to
hold
it
forcibly
without
consulting
the
many
secondly
the
force
of
foreign
pressure
or
aggression
which
combines
men
and
states
together
for
common
defence
and
thirdly
the
inherent
force
of
a
prescriptive
or
usurpative
government
which
sustains
itself
by
standing
armies
such
are
all
the
governments
of
western
europe
not
one
of
them
could
exist
hours
but
for
the
standing
armies
these
standing
armies
became
necessary
and
grew
up
as
slavery
disappeared
the
old
barons
kept
the
canaille
the
proletariat
the
sans
culottes
the
nomadic
beggars
in
order
by
lashing
their
backs
and
supplying
their
wants
they
must
be
fed
and
kept
at
work
modern
society
tries
to
effect
this
but
in
vain
by
moral
suasion
and
standing
armies
riots
mobs
strikes
and
revolutions
are
daily
occurring
the
mass
of
mankind
can
not
be
governed
by
law
more
of
despotic
discretion
and
less
of
law
is
what
the
world
wants
we
take
our
leave
by
saying
there
is
too
much
of
law
and
too
little
of
government
in
this
world
physical
force
not
moral
suasion
governs
the
world
the
negro
sees
the
driver
lash
becomes
accustomed
to
obedient
cheerful
industry
and
is
not
aware
that
the
lash
is
the
force
that
impels
him
the
free
citizen
fulfills
con
amore
his
round
of
social
political
and
domestic
duties
and
never
dreams
that
the
law
with
its
fines
and
jails
penitentiaries
and
halters
or
public
opinion
with
its
ostracism
its
mobs
and
its
tar
and
feathers
help
to
keep
him
revolving
in
his
orbit
yet
remove
these
physical
forces
and
how
many
good
citizens
would
shoot
like
fiery
comets
from
their
spheres
and
disturb
society
with
their
eccentricities
and
their
crimes
government
is
the
life
of
a
nation
and
as
no
one
can
foresee
the
various
future
circumstances
of
social
any
more
than
of
individual
life
it
is
absurd
to
define
on
paper
at
the
birth
of
either
the
nation
or
individual
what
they
shall
do
and
what
not
do
broad
construction
of
constitutions
is
as
good
as
no
constitution
for
it
leaves
the
nation
to
adapt
itself
to
circumstances
but
strict
construction
will
destroy
any
nation
for
action
is
necessary
to
national
conservation
and
can
not
foresee
what
action
will
be
necessary
if
individual
or
social
life
were
passed
in
mere
passivity
constitutions
might
answer
not
in
a
changing
and
active
world
louisiana
florida
and
texas
would
have
been
denied
to
the
south
under
strict
construction
and
she
would
have
been
ruined
a
constitution
strictly
construed
is
absolutely
inconsistent
with
permanent
national
existence

macbeth
the
reader
must
have
remarked
our
propensity
of
putting
scraps
of
poetry
at
the
head
of
our
chapters
or
of
interweaving
them
with
the
text
it
answers
as
a
sort
of
chorus
or
refrain
and
when
skillfully
handled
has
as
fine
an
effect
as
the
fiddle
at
a
feast
or
the
brass
band
on
the
eve
of
an
engagement
it
nerves
the
author
for
greater
effort
and
inspires
the
reader
with
resolution
to
follow
him
in
his
most
profound
ratiocinations
and
airiest
speculations
we
learnt
it
from
our
masters
in
the
art
of
war
when
we
carried
their
camp
and
their
whole
park
of
artillery
which
we
are
now
using
with
such
murderous
effect
against
their
own
ranks
we
also
captured
their
camp
equipage
books
of
military
strategy
in
them
we
found
rules
laid
down
for
the
famous
songs
which
are
so
harmoniously
blended
with
the
speeches
at
all
infidel
and
abolition
conventions
and
women
rights
and
free
love
assemblages
they
are
intended
to
inspire
enthusiasm
confirm
conviction
and
to
screw
the
courage
to
the
sticking
point
besides
sometimes
they
answer
admirably
the
opposite
purpose
of
a
sedative
often
when
sister
this
one
has
by
her
imprudent
speech
outraged
decency
propriety
religion
and
morality
and
drawn
down
upon
her
head
hisses
and
cries
of
turn
her
out
turn
her
out
brother
that
one
bursts
forth
in
strains
of
sweetest
melody
and
like
another
orpheus
quells
and
quiets
another
hell
not
that
we
intend
by
any
means
to
intimate
that
this
musical
brother
would
play
orpheus
throughout
and
take
as
long
and
perilous
a
trip
to
rescue
his
sister
as
orpheus
did
for
eurydice
on
the
contrary
we
suspect
in
such
contingency
he
would
pray
to
pluto
to
double
bar
the
gates
and
bribe
cerberus
to
keep
closer
watch
we
derive
this
impression
from
the
triangular
correspondence
of
greeley
andrews
and
james
entitled
love
marriage
and
divorce
and
from
the
actings
and
doings
of
the
courts
and
legislature
of
massachusetts
who
from
the
number
of
the
divorces
they
grant
we
should
think
could
hardly
find
time
to
send
hiss
on
a
visit
of
purification
to
the
convents
now
it
may
be
that
sometimes
when
we
have
gone
it
rather
strong
as
we
are
very
apt
to
do
and
offended
the
reader
our
scraps
of
poetry
may
answer
the
purpose
of
the
abolition
songs
and
soothe
and
propitiate
him
besides
they
afford
a
sort
of
interlude
or
like
that
of
sancho
where
he
slipped
off
from
the
flying
horse
clavileno
just
as
he
and
the
don
had
reached
the
constellation
of
the
goat
and
went
to
playing
with
the
little
goats
to
relieve
the
giddiness
of
his
head
i
am
sure
when
we
have
as
we
often
do
mounted
with
our
reader
into
the
highest
regions
of
metaphysics
that
his
head
becomes
a
little
giddy
at
least
ours
does
and
that
he
is
thankful
for
a
little
poetry
or
a
turn
at
play
with
our
abolition
goats
goats
indeed
quoth
g
lions
you
had
better
say
well
be
it
lions
we
are
no
more
afraid
of
you
than
if
you
were
lambs
and
you
will
no
sooner
dare
to
attack
us
than
you
did
the
knight
of
la
mancha
when
he
vainly
challenged
you
to
mortal
combat
let
not
the
reader
suppose
that
we
either
emulate
the
chivalry
of
the
don
or
the
wisdom
of
his
squire
a
northern
clime
has
congealed
the
courage
of
our
lions
and
they
are
afraid
of
the
paper
bullets
of
the
brain
yet
they
are
vastly
fond
of
shooting
them
at
others
provided
they
are
sure
the
shot
will
not
be
returned
as
for
sancho
we
think
him
the
wisest
man
we
ever
read
after
except
solomon
indeed
in
the
world
of
fiction
all
the
wisdom
issues
from
the
mouths
of
fools
as
witness
shakspeare
falstaff
and
his
fools
there
is
at
least
vraisemblance
in
all
this
for
as
in
the
real
world
the
philosophers
our
masters
in
the
art
of
war
have
monopolized
all
the
folly
where
so
likely
to
find
the
wisdom
as
among
the
fools
we
fear
our
little
cannibals
are
growing
impatient
and
may
be
a
little
jealous
of
our
seeming
preference
for
our
goats
they
are
young
yet
and
require
nursing
but
they
are
young
herculeses
born
with
teeth
and
if
any
abolition
serpents
attempt
to
strangle
them
in
the
cradle
they
be
apt
to
get
the
worst
of
it
the
danger
is
however
that
the
abolitionists
will
steal
and
adopt
them
for
they
are
vastly
fond
of
young
cannibals
and
employ
much
of
their
time
in
sewing
and
knitting
and
getting
up
subscriptions
to
send
shirts
and
trowsers
to
the
little
fellows
away
over
in
africa
who
as
indignantly
repel
them
as
old
king
lear
did
when
he
stripped
in
the
storm
and
resolved
to
be
his
unsophisticated
self
now
seeing
that
the
abolitionists
are
so
devoted
to
the
uncouth
dirty
naked
little
cannibals
of
africa
have
we
good
reason
to
fear
that
they
will
run
away
with
and
adopt
ours
when
they
come
forth
neatly
dressed
in
black
muslin
and
all
shining
with
gold
from
the
master
hands
of
morris
and
wynne
they
will
be
sure
at
least
to
captivate
the
hearts
of
the
ladies
and
if
they
will
treat
them
well
in
infancy
we
do
know
but
what
if
they
will
wait
till
they
grow
up
we
may
spare
them
a
husband
or
two
from
the
number
morris
has
promised
they
shall
be
black
as
erebus
without
and
white
as
driven
snow
within
if
they
can
get
over
the
trying
time
of
infancy
if
the
critics
smother
them
in
the
cradle
the
boys
will
make
their
own
way
in
the
world
and
get
a
name
famous
as
toussaint
or
dessalines
to
be
candid
with
the
reader
we
have
learned
lately
that
the
physique
of
a
book
is
quite
as
important
as
its
metaphysique
the
outside
as
the
inside
figure
size
proportion
are
all
to
be
consulted
for
books
are
now
used
quite
as
much
for
centre
table
ornaments
as
for
reading
we
have
a
marble
one
on
our
centre
table
that
answers
the
former
purpose
admirably
because
nobody
can
put
puzzling
questions
about
its
contents
now
we
must
write
the
exact
amount
and
no
more
to
enable
morris
and
wynne
to
make
our
book
appear
externally
comme
il
faut
we
write
this
chapter
in
part
for
that
purpose
the
reader
would
not
object
to
a
page
or
so
more
or
less
of
it
and
morris
and
wynne
will
know
how
to
curtail
or
omit
for
they
are
not
only
masters
of
their
own
trades
but
can
render
us
valuable
assistance
in
ours
we
return
to
our
cannibals
with
this
single
remark
to
that
morose
and
demure
reader
who
is
snarling
at
our
occasional
levity
you
sir
never
throw
off
your
dignity
because
you
would
be
sure
to
uncover
your
folly
we
warn
the
north
that
every
one
of
the
leading
abolitionists
is
agitating
the
negro
slavery
question
merely
as
a
means
to
attain
ulterior
ends
and
those
ends
nearer
home
they
would
not
spend
so
much
time
and
money
for
the
mere
sake
of
the
negro
or
his
master
about
whom
they
care
little
but
they
know
that
men
once
fairly
committed
to
negro
slavery
agitation
once
committed
to
the
sweeping
principle
that
man
being
a
moral
agent
accountable
to
god
for
his
actions
should
not
have
those
actions
controlled
and
directed
by
the
will
of
another
are
in
effect
committed
to
socialism
and
communism
to
the
most
ultra
doctrines
of
garrison
goodell
smith
and
andrews
to
no
private
property
no
church
no
law
no
government
to
free
love
free
lands
free
women
and
free
churches
there
is
no
middle
ground
not
an
inch
of
ground
of
any
sort
between
the
doctrines
which
we
hold
and
those
which
garrison
holds
if
slavery
either
white
or
black
be
wrong
in
principle
or
practice
then
is
garrison
right
then
is
all
human
government
wrong
socialism
not
abolition
is
the
real
object
of
black
republicanism
the
north
not
the
south
the
true
like
fanny
wright
the
author
of
american
socialism
the
agitators
of
the
north
look
upon
free
society
as
a
mere
transition
state
to
a
better
but
untried
form
of
society
the
reader
will
not
fully
comprehend
the
ideas
we
would
convey
without
reading
england
the
civilizer
by
miss
fanny
wright
it
is
worth
reading
not
only
as
far
the
best
history
of
the
british
constitution
but
as
the
most
correct
and
perfect
analysis
and
delineation
of
free
society
of
that
form
of
society
which
all
socialists
and
all
thinking
men
agree
can
not
stand
as
it
is
the
abolition
school
of
socialists
like
it
because
it
is
intolerable
because
they
consider
it
a
transition
state
to
a
form
of
society
without
law
or
government
miss
wright
has
the
honesty
to
admit
that
a
has
never
taken
place
no
and
never
will
take
place
because
the
expulsion
of
human
nature
is
a
to
its
occurrence
but
we
solemnly
warn
the
north
that
what
she
calls
a
is
what
every
leading
abolitionist
is
moving
heaven
and
earth
to
attain
this
is
their
real
object
negro
emancipation
a
mere
in
the
attempt
to
attain
transition
seas
of
gore
may
be
shed
until
military
despotism
comes
in
to
restore
peace
and
security
we
for
we
are
a
socialist
agree
with
carlyle
that
the
action
of
free
society
must
be
reversed
that
instead
of
relaxing
more
and
more
the
bonds
that
bind
man
to
man
you
must
screw
them
up
more
closely
that
instead
of
no
government
you
must
have
more
government
and
this
is
eminently
true
in
america
where
from
the
nature
of
things
as
society
becomes
older
and
population
more
dense
more
of
government
will
be
required
to
prevent
the
attempt
at
transition
which
would
only
usher
in
revolution
you
must
begin
to
govern
more
vigorously
but
we
will
be
asked
how
is
this
to
be
effected
the
answer
is
easy
the
means
are
at
hand
and
the
work
is
begun
the
democratic
party
purged
of
its
radicalism
and
largely
recruited
from
the
ranks
of
the
old
line
whigs
has
become
eminently
and
actively
conservative
it
is
the
antipodes
of
the
democratic
party
of
the
days
of
jefferson
in
the
grounds
which
it
occupies
and
the
opinions
which
it
holds
what
it
professes
to
hold
is
another
thing
yet
it
has
been
a
consistent
party
throughout
consistent
in
wisely
and
boldly
adapting
its
action
to
the
emergencies
of
the
occasion
it
is
pathological
and
practices
according
to
prevailing
symptoms
is
true
it
has
a
mighty
nosology
in
its
declaration
of
independence
bills
of
rights
constitutions
platforms
and
preambles
and
resolutions
but
like
a
good
physician
it
watches
the
state
of
the
patient
and
casts
nosology
to
the
dogs
when
the
symptoms
require
it
when
we
entered
the
party
we
were
radicals
and
half
abolitionists
and
found
inscribed
on
its
banner
world
is
too
much
governed
now
we
are
sure
the
conviction
has
fastened
itself
on
the
heart
of
every
good
citizen
that
the
world
is
too
little
governed
the
true
and
honorable
distinction
of
the
democratic
party
is
that
it
has
but
one
unbending
principle
the
safety
of
the
people
is
the
supreme
law
to
this
party
we
think
the
nation
and
the
north
may
confidently
look
for
a
happy
exodus
from
our
difficulties
it
is
pure
honest
active
and
patriotic
now
and
will
continue
so
as
long
as
the
dark
cloud
of
abolition
and
socialism
lowers
and
threatens
at
the
north
long
and
quiet
possession
of
power
will
be
sure
to
corrupt
it
it
will
be
then
time
to
cast
it
aside
it
is
now
able
and
it
alone
is
able
to
grapple
with
and
strangle
the
treasons
of
the
north
times
change
and
men
change
with
them
good
and
brave
men
are
proud
not
ashamed
of
such
changes
let
no
false
pride
of
seeming
consistency
deter
us
from
an
avowal
which
omitted
may
trammel
and
impede
our
action
our
old
nosology
is
an
effective
arsenal
and
armory
for
the
most
ultra
abolitionists
and
the
more
effective
because
we
have
not
repudiated
it
let
world
is
too
little
be
adopted
as
our
motto
inscribed
upon
our
flag
and
run
up
to
the
we
learn
that
many
of
the
old
federalists
of
the
north
and
some
of
the
south
are
joining
our
ranks
we
welcome
them
their
principles
were
wrong
when
they
adopted
them
but
barring
their
consolidation
doctrines
will
answer
pretty
well
now
it
was
ever
the
misfortune
of
the
old
federal
party
and
the
lately
deceased
whig
party
to
be
right
at
the
wrong
time
they
were
as
the
doctors
say
nosological
and
not
pathological
in
practice
the
whig
party
of
england
like
the
democratic
party
of
america
is
eminently
pathological
active
observant
and
impressible
chapter

wm
lloyd
garrison
esq
dear
sir
i
have
observed
so
much
fairness
in
the
manner
in
which
slavery
and
other
sociological
questions
are
treated
in
that
it
has
occurred
to
me
you
would
not
consider
suggestions
from
an
ultra
man
obtrusive
and
might
deem
them
worth
a
place
in
your
columns
i
shall
not
promise
that
the
example
of
your
liberality
will
be
followed
at
the
south
it
is
a
theory
of
mine
that
recurrence
to
fundamental
principles
is
only
treason
clothed
in
periphrastic
phrase
and
that
the
right
of
private
judgment
liberty
of
the
press
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
religion
are
subordinate
to
these
principles
and
must
not
be
allowed
to
assail
them
else
there
can
be
no
stability
in
government
or
security
of
private
rights
the
south
thinks
me
heretical
but
feels
that
i
am
right
and
takes
care
to
trammel
these
sacred
rights
quite
as
efficiently
by
an
austere
public
opinion
as
louis
napoleon
does
by
law
or
by
mere
volition
i
entirely
concur
in
a
theory
i
heard
wendell
phillips
propound
in
a
lecture
at
new
haven
i
shall
not
attempt
to
give
his
eloquent
words
for
i
am
incapable
of
doing
justice
to
his
language
but
the
amount
of
his
theory
was
that
governments
are
not
formed
by
man
but
are
the
gradual
accretions
of
time
circumstance
and
human
exigencies
that
they
grow
up
like
trees
and
that
man
may
cultivate
train
and
aid
their
growth
and
development
but
can
not
make
them
out
and
out
now
i
accept
the
theory
and
propose
in
the
first
place
to
deter
men
from
applying
the
axe
to
the
root
of
our
southern
institutions
that
is
discussing
or
recurring
to
fundamental
principles
by
moral
suasion
or
monition
next
by
tar
and
feathers
and
that
failing
by
the
halter
the
worst
institutions
that
ever
in
any
country
are
better
than
the
best
that
philosophers
or
philanthropists
ever
devised
as
for
ours
we
deem
them
since
the
days
of
rome
athens
and
judea
the
crack
institutions
of
the
world
with
these
preliminary
remarks
i
will
make
the
following
suggestions
or
interrogations
is
not
slavery
to
capital
less
tolerable
than
slavery
to
human
masters
where
a
few
as
in
england
ireland
and
scotland
own
all
the
lands
are
not
the
mass
the
common
laborers
who
own
no
capital
and
possess
neither
mechanical
nor
professional
skill
of
necessity
the
slaves
to
capital
was
it
not
this
slavery
to
capital
that
occasioned
the
great
irish
famine
and
is
it
not
this
same
slavery
that
keeps
the
large
majority
of
the
laboring
class
in
western
europe
in
a
state
of
hereditary
starvation
in
old
societies
where
the
laborers
are
domestic
slaves
and
exceed
in
number
the
demand
for
labor
would
not
emancipating
them
subject
them
at
once
to
a
mastery
or
exacting
despotism
of
capital
far
more
oppressive
than
domestic
slavery
did
not
the
emancipation
of
european
serfs
or
villiens
in
all
instances
injure
their
condition
as
a
class
in
the
event
of
the
occurrence
of
such
excess
of
domestic
slaves
would
it
not
be
more
merciful
to
follow
the
spartan
plan
and
kill
the
surplus
than
the
abolition
plan
which
sets
them
all
free
to
live
on
half
allowance
and
to
make
free
labor
cheaper
than
slave
labor
by
this
fierce
competition
and
underbidding
to
get
employment
are
there
not
fewer
checks
to
superior
wit
skill
and
capital
and
less
of
protection
afforded
to
the
weak
ignorant
and
landless
mass
in
northern
society
than
in
any
other
ever
devised
by
the
wit
of
man
is
not
in
english
every
man
for
himself
and
devil
take
the
hindmost
your
whole
theory
and
practice
of
government
when
your
society
grows
older
your
population
more
dense
and
property
by
your
trading
speculating
and
commercial
habits
gets
into
a
few
hands
will
not
the
slavery
to
capital
be
more
complete
and
unmitigated
than
in
any
part
of
europe
where
a
throne
a
nobility
and
established
church
stand
between
the
bosses
bankers
and
landlords
and
the
oppressed
masses
do
not
almost
all
men
of
a
philosophical
turn
of
mind
in
western
europe
and
our
north
concur
in
opinion
that
the
whole
framework
of
society
religious
ethical
economic
legal
and
political
requires
radical
change
is
not
the
absence
of
such
opinion
at
the
south
and
its
prevalence
in
free
society
conclusive
proof
of
the
naturalness
and
necessity
of
domestic
slavery
would
not
the
north
be
willing
to
leave
the
settlement
of
the
slavery
question
in
kansas
to
the
public
opinion
of
christendom
for
it
will
be
settled
by
all
christendom
of
whom
not
one
in
a
hundred
will
be
slaveholders
if
it
were
not
sensible
that
public
opinion
was
about
to
decide
in
favor
of
slavery
and
therefore
that
it
must
be
forstalled
by
federal
legislation
a
southerner
since
our
work
was
in
the
press
the
above
has
appeared
in
the
we
embrace
the
occasion
to
thank
garrison
for
his
courtesy
and
to
make
a
few
remarks
that
we
hope
will
not
be
deemed
or
impertinent
a
comparison
of
opinions
and
of
institutions
between
north
and
south
will
lead
to
kinder
and
more
pacific
relations
hitherto
such
comparisons
could
not
be
made
because
the
south
believed
herself
wrong
weak
and
defenceless
and
that
abolition
was
but
an
attempt
to
apply
the
brand
to
the
explosive
materials
of
her
social
edifice
she
is
now
equally
confident
of
her
justice
and
her
strength
and
believes
her
social
system
more
stable
as
well
as
more
benevolent
equitable
and
natural
than
that
of
the
north
whilst
she
will
never
tolerate
radical
agitation
and
demagoguical
propagandism
she
is
ready
for
philosophical
argument
and
discussion
and
for
historical
and
statistical
comparison
a
southerner
employs
the
term
discussion
as
equivalent
to
agitation
for
the
south
does
not
proscribe
the
discussion
of
any
subject
by
proper
persons
at
proper
places
and
on
proper
occasions
who
are
proper
persons
and
what
proper
times
and
places
must
be
left
to
a
healthy
just
and
enlightened
public
opinion
to
determine
but
men
shall
not
lecture
our
children
in
the
streets
on
the
beauties
of
infidelity
parsons
shall
not
preach
politics
from
the
pulpit
women
shall
not
crop
the
petticoat
mount
the
rostrum
and
descant
on
the
purity
of
free
love
incendiaries
shall
not
make
speeches
against
the
right
of
landholders
nor
teach
our
negroes
the
sacred
doctrines
of
liberty
and
equality
we
are
satisfied
with
our
institutions
and
are
not
willing
to
submit
them
to
the
experimentum
in
vile
corpus
if
the
north
thinks
her
own
worthless
or
only
valuable
as
subjects
for
anatomical
dissection
or
chemical
and
phrenological
experiments
she
may
advance
the
cause
of
humanity
by
treating
her
people
as
philosophers
do
mice
and
hares
and
dead
frogs
we
think
her
case
not
so
desperate
as
to
authorize
such
reckless
experimentation
though
her
experiment
has
failed
she
is
not
yet
dead
there
is
a
way
still
open
for
recovery
as
we
are
a
brother
socialist
we
have
a
right
to
prescribe
for
the
patient
and
our
consulting
brethren
garrison
greely
and
others
should
duly
consider
the
value
of
our
opinion
extremes
meet
and
we
and
the
leading
abolitionists
differ
but
a
hairbreadth
we
like
carlyle
prescribe
more
of
government
they
insist
on
yet
their
social
institutions
would
make
excellently
conducted
southern
sugar
and
cotton
farms
with
a
head
to
govern
them
add
a
virginia
overseer
to
greely
phalansteries
and
greely
and
we
would
have
little
to
quarrel
about
we
have
a
lively
expectation
that
when
our
cannibals
make
their
entreé
our
masters
in
the
art
of
war
will
greet
them
with
applause
instead
of
hisses
with
a
feu
de
joie
or
gratulatory
salute
instead
of
a
murderous
broadside
we
want
to
be
friends
with
them
and
with
all
the
world
and
as
the
curtain
is
falling
we
conclude
with
the
valedictory
and
invocation
of
the
roman
actor

not
only
does
