chapter
one
the
ole
virginia
the
ring
around
the
sun
had
thickened
all
day
long
and
the
turquoise
blue
of
the
arizona
sky
had
filmed
storms
in
the
dry
countries
are
infrequent
but
heavy
and
this
surely
meant
storm
we
had
ridden
since
over
broad
mesas
down
and
out
of
deep
canons
along
the
base
of
the
mountain
in
the
wildest
parts
of
the
territory
the
cattle
were
winding
leisurely
toward
the
high
country
the
jack
rabbits
had
disappeared
the
quail
lacked
we
did
not
see
a
single
antelope
in
the
open
it
a
case
of
hole
up
the
cattleman
ventured
his
opinion
i
have
a
ranch
over
in
the
double
charley
and
windy
bill
hold
it
down
we
tackle
it
what
do
you
think
the
four
cowboys
agreed
we
dropped
into
a
low
broad
watercourse
ascended
its
bed
to
big
cottonwoods
and
flowing
water
followed
it
into
box
canons
between
carved
fantastically
and
painted
like
a
moorish
facade
until
at
last
in
a
widening
below
a
rounded
hill
we
came
upon
an
adobe
house
a
fruit
tree
and
a
round
corral
this
was
the
double
charley
and
windy
bill
welcomed
us
with
soda
biscuits
we
turned
our
horses
out
spread
our
beds
on
the
floor
filled
our
pipes
and
squatted
on
our
heels
various
dogs
of
various
breeds
investigated
us
it
was
very
pleasant
and
we
did
not
mind
the
ring
around
the
sun
somebody
else
coming
announced
the
cattleman
finally
uncle
jim
said
charley
after
a
glance
a
old
man
with
a
long
white
beard
and
long
white
hair
rode
out
from
the
cottonwoods
he
had
on
a
battered
broad
hat
abnormally
high
of
crown
carried
across
his
saddle
a
heavy
eight
square
rifle
and
was
followed
by
a
lolloping
hounds
the
largest
and
fiercest
of
the
latter
catching
sight
of
our
group
launched
himself
with
lightning
rapidity
at
the
biggest
of
the
ranch
dogs
promptly
nailed
that
canine
by
the
back
of
the
neck
shook
him
violently
a
score
of
times
flung
him
aside
and
pounced
on
the
next
during
the
ensuing
few
moments
that
hound
was
the
busiest
thing
in
the
west
he
satisfactorily
whipped
four
dogs
pursued
two
cats
up
a
tree
upset
the
dutch
oven
and
the
rest
of
the
soda
biscuits
stampeded
the
horses
and
raised
a
cloud
of
dust
adequate
to
represent
the
smoke
of
battle
we
others
were
too
paralysed
to
move
uncle
jim
sat
placidly
on
his
white
horse
his
thin
knees
bent
to
the
stirrups
smoking
in
ten
seconds
the
trouble
was
over
principally
because
there
was
no
more
trouble
to
make
the
hound
returned
leisurely
licking
from
his
chops
the
hair
of
his
victims
uncle
jim
shook
his
head
trailer
said
he
sadly
is
a
little
severe
we
agreed
heartily
and
turned
in
to
welcome
uncle
jim
with
a
fresh
batch
of
soda
biscuits
the
old
man
was
one
of
the
typical
long
hairs
he
had
come
to
the
galiuro
mountains
in
and
since
he
had
remained
in
the
galiuro
mountains
spite
of
man
or
the
devil
at
present
he
possessed
some
hundreds
of
cattle
which
he
was
reputed
to
water
in
a
dry
season
from
an
ordinary
dishpan
in
times
past
he
had
prospected
that
evening
the
severe
trailer
having
dropped
to
slumber
he
held
forth
on
hunting
and
dogs
quartz
claims
and
apaches
did
you
ever
have
any
very
close
calls
i
asked
he
ruminated
a
few
moments
refilled
his
pipe
with
some
awful
tobacco
and
told
the
following
experience
in
the
time
of
geronimo
i
was
living
just
about
where
i
do
now
and
that
was
just
about
in
line
with
the
raiding
you
see
geronimo
and
ju
and
old
loco
used
to
pile
out
of
the
reservation
at
camp
apache
raid
south
to
the
line
slip
over
into
mexico
when
the
soldiers
got
too
promiscuous
and
raid
there
until
they
got
ready
to
come
back
then
there
was
always
a
big
medicine
talk
says
geronimo
i
am
tired
of
the
warpath
i
will
come
back
from
mexico
with
all
my
warriors
if
you
will
escort
me
with
soldiers
and
protect
my
people
all
right
says
the
general
being
only
too
glad
to
get
him
back
at
all
so
then
in
ten
minutes
there
would
be
a
buck
in
camp
but
next
morning
they
shows
up
again
each
with
about
fifty
head
of
hosses
where
you
get
those
hosses
asks
the
general
suspicious
had
pastured
in
the
hills
answers
geronimo
i
ca
take
all
those
hosses
with
me
i
believe
they
stolen
says
the
general
my
people
can
not
go
without
their
hosses
says
geronimo
so
across
the
line
they
goes
and
back
to
the
reservation
in
about
a
week
there
frantic
greasers
wanting
to
know
where
their
hosses
the
army
is
nothing
but
an
importer
of
stolen
stock
and
knows
it
and
ca
help
it
well
as
i
says
i
between
camp
apache
and
the
mexican
line
so
that
every
raiding
party
goes
right
on
past
me
the
point
is
that
i
a
thousand
feet
or
so
above
the
valley
and
the
renegades
is
in
such
a
devil
of
a
hurry
about
that
time
that
they
never
stop
to
climb
up
and
collect
me
often
i
watched
them
trailing
down
the
valley
in
a
cloud
of
dust
then
in
a
day
or
two
a
squad
of
soldiers
would
come
up
and
camp
at
my
spring
for
a
while
they
used
to
send
soldiers
to
guard
every
water
hole
in
the
country
so
the
renegades
could
get
water
after
a
while
from
not
being
bothered
none
i
got
thinking
i
was
worth
while
with
them
me
and
johnny
hooper
were
pecking
away
at
the
old
virginia
mine
then
we
got
down
about
sixty
feet
all
timbered
and
was
thinking
of
one
day
johnny
went
to
town
and
that
same
day
i
got
in
a
hurry
and
left
my
gun
at
camp
i
worked
all
the
morning
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
and
when
i
see
by
the
sun
it
was
getting
along
towards
noon
i
put
in
three
good
shots
tamped
down
lit
the
fusees
and
started
to
climb
out
it
ai
noways
pleasant
to
light
a
fuse
in
a
shaft
and
then
have
to
climb
out
a
ladder
with
it
burning
behind
you
i
never
did
get
used
to
it
you
keep
thinking
now
suppose
there
a
flaw
in
that
fuse
or
something
and
she
goes
off
in
six
seconds
instead
of
two
minutes
where
you
be
then
it
would
give
you
a
good
boost
towards
your
home
on
high
anyway
so
i
climbed
fast
and
stuck
my
head
out
the
top
without
looking
and
then
i
froze
solid
enough
there
about
fifty
feet
away
climbing
up
the
hill
on
mighty
tired
hosses
was
a
dozen
of
the
ugliest
chiricahuas
you
ever
do
want
to
meet
and
in
addition
a
mexican
renegade
named
maria
who
was
worse
than
any
of
i
see
at
once
their
hosses
was
tired
out
and
they
had
a
notion
of
camping
at
my
water
hole
not
knowing
nothing
about
the
ole
virginia
mine
for
two
bits
i
have
let
go
all
holts
and
dropped
backwards
trusting
to
my
thick
head
for
easy
lighting
then
i
heard
a
little
fizz
and
sputter
from
below
at
that
my
hair
riz
right
up
so
i
could
feel
the
breeze
blow
under
my
hat
for
about
six
seconds
i
stood
there
like
an
imbecile
grinning
amiably
then
one
of
the
chiricahuas
made
a
sort
of
grunt
and
i
sabed
that
they
seen
the
original
exhibit
your
uncle
jim
was
making
of
himself
then
that
fuse
gave
another
sputter
and
one
of
the
apaches
said
un
dah
that
means
white
man
it
was
harder
to
turn
my
head
than
if
i
had
a
stiff
neck
but
i
managed
to
do
it
and
i
see
that
my
ore
dump
was
more
than
ten
foot
away
i
mighty
near
overjumped
it
and
the
next
i
knew
i
was
on
one
side
of
it
and
those
apaches
on
the
other
probably
i
flew
leastways
i
do
seem
to
remember
jumping
that
did
seem
to
do
me
much
good
the
renegades
were
grinning
and
laughing
to
think
how
easy
a
thing
they
had
and
i
could
rightly
think
up
any
arguments
against
that
notion
at
least
from
their
standpoint
they
were
chattering
away
to
each
other
in
mexican
for
the
benefit
of
maria
oh
they
had
me
all
distributed
down
to
my
suspender
buttons
and
me
squatting
behind
that
ore
dump
about
as
formidable
as
a
brush
rabbit
then
all
at
once
one
of
my
shots
went
off
down
in
the
shaft
boom
says
she
plenty
big
and
a
slather
of
rock
and
stones
come
out
of
the
mouth
and
began
to
dump
down
promiscuous
on
the
scenery
i
got
one
little
one
in
the
and
found
time
to
wish
my
ore
dump
had
a
roof
but
those
renegades
caught
it
square
in
the
thick
of
trouble
one
got
knocked
out
entirely
for
a
minute
by
a
nice
piece
of
country
rock
in
the
head
otra
vez
yells
i
which
means
again
boom
goes
the
ole
virginia
prompt
as
an
answer
i
put
in
my
time
dodging
but
when
i
gets
a
chance
to
look
the
apaches
has
all
got
to
cover
and
is
looking
scared
otra
vez
yells
i
again
boom
says
the
ole
virginia
this
was
the
biggest
shot
of
the
lot
and
she
surely
cut
loose
i
ought
to
have
been
up
the
bill
watching
things
from
a
safe
distance
but
i
was
lucky
for
me
the
shaft
was
a
little
on
the
drift
so
she
did
quite
shoot
my
way
but
she
distributed
about
a
ton
over
those
renegades
they
sort
of
half
got
to
their
feet
uncertain
otra
vez
yells
i
once
more
as
bold
as
if
i
could
keep
her
shooting
all
day
it
was
just
a
cold
raw
blazer
and
if
it
did
go
through
i
could
see
me
as
an
apache
parlour
ornament
but
it
did
those
chiricahuas
give
one
yell
and
skipped
it
was
surely
a
funny
sight
after
they
got
aboard
their
war
ponies
to
see
them
trying
to
dig
out
on
horses
too
tired
to
trot
i
did
stop
to
get
all
the
laughs
though
in
fact
i
give
one
jump
off
that
ledge
and
i
lit
a
could
have
beat
me
to
that
shack
there
i
grabbed
old
and
made
a
climb
for
the
tall
country
aiming
to
wait
around
until
dark
and
then
to
pull
out
for
benson
johnny
hooper
was
expected
till
next
day
which
was
lucky
from
where
i
lay
i
could
see
the
apaches
camped
out
beyond
my
draw
and
i
did
doubt
they
visited
the
place
along
about
sunset
they
all
left
their
camp
and
went
into
the
draw
so
there
i
thinks
i
sees
a
good
chance
to
make
a
start
before
dark
i
dropped
down
from
the
mesa
skirted
the
butte
and
angled
down
across
the
country
after
i
gone
a
half
mile
from
the
cliffs
i
ran
across
johnny
hooper
fresh
trail
headed
towards
camp
my
heart
jumped
right
up
into
my
mouth
at
that
here
was
poor
old
johnny
a
day
too
early
with
a
of
grub
walking
innocent
as
a
yearling
right
into
the
bands
of
those
hostiles
the
trail
looked
pretty
fresh
and
benson
a
good
long
day
with
a
pack
animal
so
i
thought
perhaps
i
might
catch
him
before
he
runs
into
trouble
so
i
ran
back
on
the
trail
as
fast
as
i
could
make
it
the
sun
was
down
by
now
and
it
was
getting
dusk
i
did
overtake
him
and
when
i
got
to
the
top
of
the
canon
i
crawled
along
very
cautious
and
took
a
look
of
course
i
expected
to
see
everything
up
in
smoke
but
i
nearly
got
up
and
yelled
when
i
see
everything
all
right
and
old
sukey
the
and
johnny
hoss
hitched
up
as
peaceful
as
babies
to
the
corral
that
all
right
thinks
i
they
back
in
their
camp
and
discovered
johnny
yet
i
snail
him
out
of
there
so
i
ran
down
the
hill
and
into
the
shack
johnny
sat
in
his
chair
what
there
was
of
him
he
must
have
got
in
about
two
hours
before
sundown
for
they
had
lots
of
time
to
put
in
on
him
the
reason
they
stayed
so
long
up
the
draw
poor
old
johnny
i
was
glad
it
was
night
and
he
was
dead
apaches
are
the
worst
injuns
there
is
for
tortures
they
cut
off
the
bottoms
of
old
man
wilkins
feet
and
stood
him
on
an
in
a
minute
or
so
though
my
wits
gets
to
work
why
ai
the
shack
burned
i
asks
myself
and
why
is
the
hoss
and
the
mule
tied
all
so
peaceful
to
the
corral
it
did
take
long
for
a
man
who
knows
injins
to
answer
those
conundrums
the
whole
thing
was
a
trap
for
me
and
i
walked
into
it
as
a
with
that
i
makes
a
run
outside
by
now
it
was
dark
and
listens
sure
enough
i
hears
hosses
so
i
makes
a
rapid
sneak
back
over
the
trail
everything
seemed
all
right
till
i
got
up
to
the
then
i
heard
more
hosses
ahead
of
me
and
when
i
looked
back
i
could
see
some
injuns
already
at
the
shack
and
starting
to
build
a
fire
outside
in
a
tight
fix
a
man
is
pretty
apt
to
get
scared
till
all
hope
is
gone
then
he
is
pretty
apt
to
get
cool
and
calm
that
was
my
case
i
could
go
ahead
there
was
those
hosses
coming
along
the
trail
i
could
go
back
there
was
those
injins
building
the
fire
so
i
skirmished
around
till
i
got
a
bright
star
right
over
the
trail
head
and
i
trained
old
to
bear
on
that
star
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
when
the
star
was
darkened
i
turn
loose
so
i
lay
there
a
while
listening
by
and
by
the
star
was
blotted
out
and
i
cut
loose
and
old
missed
fire
she
never
did
it
before
nor
since
i
think
that
cartridge
well
i
do
know
where
the
injins
came
from
but
it
seemed
as
if
the
hammer
had
hardly
clicked
before
three
or
four
of
them
bad
piled
on
me
i
put
up
the
best
fight
i
could
for
i
was
figuring
to
be
caught
alive
and
this
deal
had
fooled
me
all
along
the
line
they
surely
had
a
lively
time
i
expected
every
minute
to
feel
a
knife
in
my
back
but
when
i
did
get
it
then
i
knew
they
wanted
to
bring
me
in
alive
and
that
made
me
fight
harder
first
and
last
we
rolled
and
plunged
all
the
way
from
the
down
to
the
then
one
of
the
injins
sung
out
maria
and
i
thought
of
that
renegade
mexican
and
what
i
heard
bout
him
and
that
made
me
fight
harder
yet
but
after
we
fought
down
to
the
and
had
lost
most
of
our
skin
a
more
fell
on
me
and
in
less
than
no
time
they
had
me
tied
then
they
picked
me
up
and
carried
me
over
to
where
built
a
big
fire
by
the
corral
uncle
jim
stopped
with
an
air
of
finality
and
began
lazily
to
refill
his
pipe
from
the
open
mud
fireplace
he
picked
a
coal
outside
the
rain
faithful
to
the
prophecy
of
the
sun
beat
fitfully
against
the
roof
that
was
the
closest
call
i
ever
had
said
he
at
last
but
uncle
jim
we
cried
in
a
confused
chorus
how
did
you
get
away
what
did
the
indians
do
to
you
who
rescued
you
uncle
jim
chuckled
the
first
man
i
saw
sitting
at
that
fire
said
he
was
lieutenant
price
of
the
united
states
army
and
by
him
was
tom
horn
this
he
asks
and
horn
talks
to
the
injins
in
apache
say
they
caught
maria
translates
horn
back
again
says
lieutenant
price
is
jim
fox
i
know
him
so
they
turned
me
loose
it
seems
the
troops
had
driven
off
the
renegades
an
hour
before
and
the
indians
who
caught
you
uncle
jim
you
said
they
were
indians
were
tonto
basin
apaches
explained
the
old
man
government
scouts
under
tom
horn
pronounced
hoo
chapter
two
the
emigrants
after
the
rain
that
had
held
us
holed
up
at
the
double
r
over
one
day
we
discussed
what
we
should
do
next
the
flats
will
be
too
boggy
for
riding
and
anyway
the
cattle
will
be
in
the
high
country
the
cattleman
summed
up
the
situation
we
bog
down
the
if
we
tried
to
get
back
to
the
but
now
after
the
rain
the
weather
ought
to
be
beautiful
what
shall
we
do
was
you
ever
in
the
jackson
country
asked
uncle
jim
it
the
wildest
part
of
arizona
it
a
big
country
and
rough
and
no
one
lives
there
and
there
lots
of
deer
and
mountain
lions
and
bear
here
my
dogs
we
might
have
a
hunt
good
said
we
we
skirmished
around
and
found
a
condemned
army
pack
saddle
with
aparejos
and
a
sawbuck
saddle
with
kyacks
on
these
we
managed
to
condense
our
grub
and
utensils
there
were
plenty
of
horses
so
our
bedding
we
bound
flat
about
their
naked
barrels
by
means
of
the
then
we
started
that
day
furnished
us
with
a
demonstration
of
what
arizona
horses
can
do
our
way
led
first
through
a
filled
with
rounded
boulders
and
rocks
slippery
and
unstable
big
cottonwoods
and
oaks
grew
so
thick
as
partially
to
conceal
the
cliffs
on
either
side
of
us
the
was
mysterious
with
caves
beautiful
with
hanging
gardens
of
tree
ferns
and
grasses
growing
thick
in
long
transverse
crevices
wonderful
in
colour
and
shape
we
passed
the
little
canons
fenced
off
by
the
rustlers
as
corrals
into
which
to
shunt
from
the
herds
their
choice
of
beeves
the
cattleman
shook
his
head
at
them
many
a
man
has
come
from
texas
and
established
a
herd
with
no
other
asset
than
a
couple
of
horses
and
a
said
he
then
we
worked
up
gradually
to
a
divide
whence
we
could
see
a
range
of
wild
and
rugged
mountains
on
our
right
they
rose
by
slopes
and
ledges
steep
and
rough
and
at
last
ended
in
the
cliffs
of
the
buttes
running
sheer
and
unbroken
for
many
miles
during
all
the
rest
of
our
trip
they
were
to
be
our
companions
the
only
constant
factors
in
the
tumult
of
lesser
peaks
precipitous
canons
and
twisted
systems
in
which
we
were
constantly
involved
the
sky
was
after
the
rain
each
and
every
arizonan
predicted
clearing
why
it
almost
never
rains
in
arizona
said
jed
parker
and
when
it
does
it
quits
before
it
begins
nevertheless
about
noon
a
thick
cloud
gathered
about
the
tops
of
the
galiuros
above
us
almost
immediately
it
was
dissipated
by
the
wind
but
when
the
peaks
again
showed
we
stared
with
astonishment
to
see
that
they
were
white
with
snow
it
was
as
though
a
magician
had
passed
a
sheet
before
them
the
brief
instant
necessary
to
work
his
great
transformation
shortly
the
sky
thickened
again
and
it
began
to
rain
travel
had
been
precarious
before
but
now
its
difficulties
were
infinitely
increased
the
clay
to
the
rubble
turned
slippery
and
adhesive
on
the
sides
of
the
mountains
it
was
almost
impossible
to
keep
a
footing
we
speedily
became
wet
our
hands
puffed
and
purple
our
boots
sodden
with
the
water
that
had
trickled
from
our
clothing
into
them
over
the
next
ridge
uncle
jim
promised
us
is
an
old
shack
that
i
fixed
up
seven
years
ago
we
can
all
make
out
to
get
in
it
over
the
next
ridge
therefore
we
slipped
and
slid
thanking
the
god
of
luck
for
each
ten
feet
gained
it
was
growing
cold
the
cliffs
and
palisades
near
at
hand
showed
dimly
behind
the
falling
rain
beyond
them
waved
and
eddied
the
storm
mists
through
which
the
mountains
revealed
and
concealed
proportions
exaggerated
into
unearthly
grandeur
deep
in
the
clefts
of
the
box
canons
the
streams
were
filling
the
roar
of
their
rapids
echoed
from
innumerable
precipices
a
soft
swish
of
water
usurped
the
world
of
sound
nothing
more
uncomfortable
or
more
magnificent
could
be
imagined
we
rode
shivering
each
said
to
himself
i
can
stand
this
right
now
at
the
present
moment
very
well
i
will
do
so
and
i
will
refuse
to
look
forward
even
five
minutes
to
what
i
may
have
to
stand
which
is
the
true
philosophy
of
tough
times
and
the
only
effective
way
to
endure
discomfort
by
luck
we
reached
the
bottom
of
that
canon
without
a
fall
it
was
wide
well
grown
with
oak
trees
and
belly
deep
in
rich
horse
feed
an
ideal
place
to
camp
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
a
thin
sheet
of
water
a
quarter
of
an
inch
deep
was
flowing
over
the
entire
surface
of
the
ground
we
spurred
on
desperately
thinking
of
a
warm
fire
and
a
chance
to
steam
the
roof
of
the
shack
had
fallen
in
and
the
floor
was
six
inches
deep
in
adobe
mud
we
did
not
dismount
that
would
have
wet
our
saddles
but
sat
on
our
horses
taking
in
the
details
finally
uncle
jim
came
to
the
front
with
a
suggestion
i
know
of
a
cave
said
he
close
under
a
butte
it
a
big
cave
but
it
has
such
a
steep
floor
that
i
not
sure
as
we
could
stay
in
it
and
it
back
the
other
side
of
that
ridge
i
do
know
how
the
ridge
is
to
get
back
over
it
was
slippery
enough
coming
this
way
and
the
cave
may
shoot
us
out
into
space
but
i
like
to
look
at
a
dry
place
anyway
replied
the
cattleman
we
all
felt
the
same
about
it
so
back
over
the
ridge
we
went
about
half
way
down
the
other
side
uncle
jim
turned
sharp
to
the
right
and
as
the
hog
back
dropped
behind
us
we
found
ourselves
out
on
the
steep
side
of
a
mountain
the
perpendicular
cliff
over
us
to
the
right
the
river
roaring
savagely
far
down
below
our
left
and
sheets
of
water
glazing
the
footing
we
could
find
among
the
boulders
and
debris
hardly
could
the
ponies
keep
from
slipping
sideways
on
the
slope
as
we
proceeded
farther
and
farther
from
the
solidity
of
the
ridge
behind
us
we
experienced
the
illusion
of
venturing
out
on
a
tight
rope
over
abysses
of
space
even
the
feeling
of
danger
was
only
an
illusion
however
composite
of
the
falling
rain
the
deepening
twilight
and
the
night
that
had
already
enveloped
the
plunge
of
the
canon
below
finally
uncle
jim
stopped
just
within
the
drip
from
the
cliffs
here
she
is
said
he
we
descended
eagerly
a
deer
bounded
away
from
the
base
of
the
buttes
the
cave
ran
steep
in
the
manner
of
an
inclined
tunnel
far
up
into
the
dimness
we
had
to
dig
our
toes
in
and
scramble
to
make
way
up
it
at
all
but
we
found
it
dry
and
after
a
little
search
discovered
a
of
earth
sufficiently
broad
for
a
seat
that
all
right
quoth
jed
parker
now
for
sleeping
places
we
scattered
uncle
jim
and
charley
promptly
annexed
the
slight
overhang
of
the
cliff
whence
the
deer
had
jumped
it
was
dry
at
the
moment
but
we
uttered
pessimistic
predictions
if
the
wind
should
change
tom
rich
and
jim
lester
had
a
little
tent
and
insisted
on
descending
to
the
got
to
cook
there
anyways
said
they
and
departed
with
the
two
pack
mules
and
their
bed
horse
that
left
the
cattleman
windy
bill
jed
parker
and
me
in
a
moment
windy
bill
came
up
to
us
whispering
and
mysterious
get
your
cavallos
and
follow
me
said
he
we
did
so
he
led
us
two
hundred
yards
to
another
cave
twenty
feet
high
fifteen
feet
in
diameter
level
as
a
floor
how
that
he
cried
in
triumph
found
her
just
now
while
i
was
rustling
for
a
fire
we
unpacked
our
beds
with
chuckles
of
joy
and
spread
them
carefully
within
the
shelter
of
the
cave
except
for
the
very
edges
which
did
not
much
matter
our
blankets
and
protected
by
the
canvas
tarp
were
reasonably
dry
every
once
in
a
while
a
spasm
of
conscience
would
seize
one
or
the
other
of
us
it
seems
sort
of
mean
on
the
other
fellows
ruminated
jed
parker
they
had
their
first
choice
cried
we
all
uncle
jim
an
old
man
the
cattleman
pointed
out
but
windy
bill
had
thought
of
that
i
told
him
of
this
yere
cave
first
but
he
allowed
he
was
plumb
satisfied
we
finished
laying
out
our
blankets
the
result
looked
good
to
us
we
all
burst
out
laughing
well
i
sorry
for
those
fellows
cried
the
cattleman
we
hobbled
our
horses
and
descended
to
the
gleam
of
the
fire
like
guilty
conspirators
there
we
ate
hastily
of
meat
bread
and
coffee
merely
for
the
sake
of
sustenance
it
certainly
amounted
to
little
in
the
way
of
pleasure
the
water
from
the
direct
rain
the
shivering
trees
and
our
hat
brims
accumulated
in
our
plates
faster
than
we
could
bail
it
out
the
dishes
were
thrust
under
a
canvas
rich
and
lester
decided
to
remain
with
their
tent
and
so
we
saw
them
no
more
until
morning
we
broke
off
of
mesquite
and
toiled
up
the
hill
tasting
thickly
the
high
altitude
in
the
severe
labour
at
the
big
cave
we
dumped
down
our
burdens
transported
our
fuel
piecemeal
to
the
vicinity
of
the
narrow
ledge
built
a
good
fire
sat
in
a
row
and
lit
our
pipes
in
a
few
moments
the
blaze
was
burning
high
and
our
bodies
had
ceased
shivering
fantastically
the
firelight
revealed
the
knobs
and
crevices
the
ledges
and
the
arching
walls
their
shadows
leaped
following
the
flames
receding
and
advancing
like
playful
beasts
far
above
us
was
a
single
tiny
opening
through
which
the
smoke
was
sucked
as
through
a
chimney
the
glow
ruddied
the
men
features
outside
was
thick
darkness
and
the
swish
and
rush
and
roar
of
rising
waters
listening
windy
bill
was
reminded
of
a
story
we
leaned
back
comfortably
against
the
sloping
walls
of
the
cave
thrust
our
feet
toward
the
blaze
smoked
and
hearkened
to
the
tale
of
windy
bill
there
a
lot
of
water
running
loose
here
but
i
seen
the
time
and
place
where
even
what
is
in
that
drip
would
be
worth
a
gold
mine
that
was
in
the
emigrant
days
they
used
to
come
over
south
of
here
through
what
they
called
emigrant
pass
on
their
way
to
californy
i
was
a
kid
then
about
eighteen
year
old
and
what
i
know
about
injins
and
agency
cattle
was
a
patch
of
alkali
i
had
a
kid
outfit
of
bridle
lots
of
silver
and
such
and
i
used
to
ride
over
and
be
the
handsome
boy
before
such
outfits
as
happened
along
they
were
queer
people
most
of
from
missoury
and
southern
seaports
and
they
were
sick
of
travel
by
the
time
they
come
in
sight
of
emigrant
pass
up
to
santa
fe
they
mostly
hiked
along
any
old
way
but
once
there
they
herded
up
together
in
bunches
of
twenty
wagons
or
so
of
our
old
friends
geronimo
and
loco
a
good
many
of
had
horned
cattle
to
their
wagons
and
they
crawled
along
about
two
miles
an
hour
hell
with
the
blower
on
nothin
to
look
at
but
a
mountain
a
week
way
chuck
full
of
alkali
plenty
of
and
rattlesnakes
but
mighty
little
water
why
you
boys
know
that
country
down
there
between
the
chiricahua
mountains
and
emigrant
pass
it
maybe
a
three
or
four
days
journey
for
these
yere
mostly
they
filled
up
their
bellies
and
their
kegs
hoping
to
last
through
but
they
sure
found
it
drier
than
cork
legs
and
generally
long
before
they
hit
the
springs
their
tongues
was
hangin
out
a
foot
you
see
for
all
their
plumb
nerve
in
comin
so
far
the
most
of
them
did
know
sic
they
were
plumb
innocent
in
regard
to
their
water
and
injins
and
such
and
the
buckskin
fakes
they
picked
up
at
santa
fe
for
guides
was
much
better
that
was
where
texas
pete
made
his
killing
texas
pete
was
a
tough
citizen
from
the
lone
star
he
was
about
as
broad
as
he
was
long
and
wore
all
sorts
of
big
whiskers
and
black
eyebrows
his
heart
was
very
bad
you
never
could
tell
where
texas
pete
was
goin
to
jump
next
he
was
a
and
a
and
a
little
black
rattlesnake
all
rolled
into
one
i
believe
that
texas
pete
person
cared
about
as
little
for
killin
a
man
as
for
a
drink
and
he
shorely
drank
without
an
effort
peaceable
citizens
just
spoke
soft
and
minded
their
own
business
onpeaceable
citizens
texas
pete
used
to
plant
out
in
the
sagebrush
now
this
texas
pete
happened
to
discover
a
water
hole
right
out
in
the
plumb
middle
of
the
desert
he
promptly
annexed
said
water
hole
digs
her
out
timbers
her
up
and
lays
for
emigrants
he
charged
two
bits
a
head
man
or
beast
and
nobody
got
a
mouthful
till
he
paid
up
in
hard
coin
think
of
the
wads
he
raked
in
i
used
to
figure
it
up
just
for
the
joy
of
envyin
him
i
reckon
an
average
outfit
first
and
last
would
bring
him
in
somewheres
about
fifty
dollars
and
besides
he
had
at
four
bits
a
glass
and
outfits
at
that
time
were
spatter
we
used
all
to
go
down
sometimes
to
watch
them
come
in
when
they
see
that
little
canvas
shack
and
that
well
they
begun
to
cheer
up
and
move
fast
and
when
they
see
that
sign
water
two
bits
a
head
their
eyes
stuck
out
like
two
raw
oysters
then
come
the
kicks
what
a
howl
they
did
raise
shorely
but
it
did
do
no
manner
of
good
texas
pete
did
do
nothin
but
sit
there
and
smoke
with
a
kind
of
sulky
gleam
in
one
corner
of
his
eye
he
did
even
take
the
trouble
to
answer
but
his
winchester
lay
across
his
lap
there
was
no
humour
in
the
situation
for
him
how
much
is
your
water
for
humans
asks
one
emigrant
ca
you
read
that
sign
texas
pete
asks
him
but
you
do
mean
two
bits
a
head
for
humans
yells
the
man
why
you
can
get
whisky
for
that
you
can
read
the
sign
ca
you
insists
texas
pete
i
can
read
it
all
right
says
the
man
tryin
a
new
deal
but
they
tell
me
not
to
believe
half
i
read
but
that
do
go
and
emigrant
shells
out
with
the
rest
i
did
blame
them
for
raisin
their
howl
why
at
that
time
the
regular
water
holes
was
chargin
five
cents
a
head
from
the
government
freighters
and
the
motto
was
always
hold
up
uncle
sam
at
that
once
in
a
while
some
outfit
would
get
mad
and
go
chargin
off
dry
but
it
was
a
long
long
way
to
the
springs
and
mighty
hot
and
dusty
texas
pete
and
his

enough
to

it
disagreeable
says
tim
that
lets
you
out
growls
pete
gettin
hostile
and
handlin
of
his
rifle
which
the
man
had
been
standin
there
bewildered
the
cup
hangin
from
his
finger
at
last
lookin
pretty
desperate
he
stooped
down
to
dig
up
a
little
of
the
wet
from
an
overflow
puddle
lyin
at
his
feet
at
the
same
time
the
hosses
left
sort
of
to
themselves
and
bein
drier
than
a
covered
bridge
drug
forward
and
stuck
their
noses
in
the
trough
gentleman
tim
and
me
was
sittin
there
on
our
hosses
a
little
to
one
side
we
saw
texas
pete
jump
up
from
his
chair
take
a
quick
aim
and
cut
loose
with
his
rifle
it
was
plumb
unexpected
to
us
we
thought
of
any
shootin
and
our
was
tied
in
of
the
jumpy
country
we
been
drivin
the
steers
over
but
gentleman
tim
who
had
unslung
his
rope
aimin
to
help
the
hosses
out
of
the
chuckhole
snatched
her
off
the
horn
and
with
one
of
the
prettiest
flip
throws
i
ever
see
done
he
snaked
old
texas
pete
right
out
of
his
gun
and
all
the
old
renegade
did
his
best
to
twist
around
for
a
shot
at
us
but
it
was
no
go
and
i
never
enjoyed
a
critter
more
in
my
life
than
i
enjoyed
texas
pete
then
we
turned
to
see
what
damage
had
been
done
we
were
some
relieved
to
find
the
family
all
right
but
texas
pete
had
bored
one
of
them
poor
old
hosses
plumb
through
the
head
it
lucky
for
you
you
do
get
the
old
man
says
gentleman
tim
very
quiet
and
polite
which
gentleman
tim
was
an
irishman
and
i
been
on
the
range
long
enough
with
him
to
know
that
when
he
got
quiet
and
polite
it
was
time
to
dodge
behind
something
i
hope
sir
says
he
to
the
stranger
that
you
will
give
your
wife
and
baby
a
satisfying
drink
as
for
your
hoss
pray
do
not
be
under
any
apprehension
our
friend
texas
pete
here
has
kindly
consented
to
make
good
any
deficiencies
from
his
own
corral
tim
could
talk
high
wide
and
handsome
when
he
set
out
to
the
man
started
to
say
something
but
i
managed
to
herd
him
to
one
side
let
him
alone
i
whispers
when
he
talks
that
way
he
mad
and
when
he
mad
it
better
to
leave
nature
to
supply
the
rods
he
seemed
to
sabe
all
right
so
we
built
us
a
little
fire
and
started
some
grub
while
gentleman
tim
walked
up
and
down
very
grand
and
fierce
by
and
by
he
seemed
to
make
up
his
mind
he
went
over
and
untied
texas
pete
stand
up
you
hound
says
he
now
listen
to
me
if
you
make
a
break
to
get
away
or
if
you
refuse
to
do
just
as
i
tell
you
i
shoot
you
but
i
march
you
up
country
and
see
that
geronimo
gets
you
he
sorted
out
a
shovel
and
pick
made
texas
pete
carry
them
right
along
the
trail
a
quarter
and
started
him
to
diggin
a
hole
texas
pete
started
in
hard
enough
tim
sittin
over
him
on
his
hoss
his
loose
and
his
rope
free
the
man
and
i
stood
by
not
darin
to
say
a
word
after
a
minute
or
so
texas
pete
began
to
work
slower
and
slower
by
and
by
he
stopped
look
here
says
he
is
this
here
thing
my
grave
i
am
goin
to
see
that
you
give
the
gentleman
hoss
decent
interment
says
gentleman
tim
very
polite
bury
a
hoss
growls
texas
pete
but
he
did
say
any
more
tim
cocked
his
perhaps
you
better
quit
panting
and
sweat
a
little
says
he
texas
pete
worked
hard
for
a
while
for
tim
quietness
was
beginning
to
scare
him
up
the
worst
way
by
and
by
he
had
got
down
maybe
four
or
five
feet
and
tim
got
off
his
hoss
i
think
that
will
do
says
he
you
may
come
out
billy
my
son
cover
him
now
texas
pete
he
says
cold
as
steel
there
is
the
grave
we
will
place
the
hoss
in
it
then
i
intend
to
shoot
you
and
put
you
in
with
the
hoss
and
write
you
an
epitaph
that
will
be
a
comfort
to
such
travellers
of
the
trail
as
are
honest
and
a
warnin
to
such
as
are
not
i
as
soon
kill
you
now
as
an
hour
from
now
so
you
may
make
a
break
for
it
if
you
feel
like
it
he
stooped
over
to
look
into
the
hole
i
thought
he
looked
an
extra
long
time
but
when
he
raised
his
head
his
face
had
changed
complete
march
says
he
very
brisk
we
all
went
back
to
the
shack
from
the
corral
tim
took
texas
best
team
and
hitched
her
to
the
old
schooner
there
says
he
to
the
man
now
you
better
hit
the
trail
take
that
whisky
keg
there
for
water
we
sat
there
without
sayin
a
word
for
some
time
after
the
schooner
had
pulled
out
then
tim
says
very
abrupt
i
changed
my
mind
he
got
up
come
on
billy
says
he
to
me
we
just
leave
our
friend
tied
up
i
be
back
to
turn
you
loose
in
the
meantime
it
hurt
you
a
bit
to
be
a
little
uncomfortable
and
hungry
and
thirsty
we
rode
off
just
about
sundown
leavin
texas
pete
lashed
tight
now
all
this
knocked
me
and
crooked
and
i
said
so
but
i
could
get
a
word
out
of
gentleman
tim
all
the
answer
i
could
get
was
just
little
laughs
we
drawed
into
the
ranch
near
midnight
but
next
mornin
tim
had
a
long
talk
with
the
boss
and
the
result
was
that
the
whole
outfit
was
instructed
to
arm
up
with
a
pick
or
a
shovel
apiece
and
to
get
set
for
texas
pete
we
got
there
a
little
after
noon
turned
the
old
boy
out
without
firearms
and
then
began
to
dig
at
a
place
tim
told
us
to
near
that
grave
of
texas
pete
in
three
hours
we
had
the
finest
developed
you
ever
want
to
see
then
the
boss
stuck
up
a
sign
that
said
public
water
free
now
you
old
skin
says
he
to
texas
pete
charge
all
you
want
to
on
your
own
property
but
if
i
ever
hear
of
your
layin
claim
to
this
other
hole
i
shore
make
you
hard
to
catch
then
we
rode
off
home
you
see
when
gentleman
tim
inspected
that
grave
he
noted
indications
of
water
and
it
struck
him
that
the
old
renegade
out
of
business
was
a
neater
way
of
gettin
even
than
merely
killin
him
somebody
threw
a
fresh
mesquite
on
the
fire
the
flames
leaped
up
again
showing
a
thin
trickle
of
water
running
down
the
other
side
of
the
cave
the
steady
downpour
again
made
itself
prominent
through
the
silence
what
did
texas
pete
do
after
that
asked
the
cattleman
texas
pete
chuckled
windy
bill
well
he
put
in
a
heap
of
his
spare
time
lettin
tim
alone
chapter
three
the
remittance
man
after
windy
bill
had
finished
his
story
we
began
to
think
it
time
to
turn
in
uncle
jim
and
charley
slid
and
slipped
down
the
passage
leading
from
the
cave
and
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
the
overhang
beneath
which
they
had
spread
their
bed
after
a
moment
we
tore
off
long
bundles
of
the
blades
lit
the
resinous
ends
at
our
fire
and
with
these
torches
started
to
make
our
way
along
the
base
of
the
cliff
to
the
other
cave
once
without
the
influence
of
the
fire
our
impromptu
links
cast
an
adequate
light
the
sheets
of
rain
became
suddenly
visible
as
they
entered
the
circle
of
illumination
by
careful
scrutiny
of
the
footing
i
gained
the
entrance
to
our
cave
without
mishap
i
looked
back
here
and
there
irregularly
gleamed
and
spluttered
my
companions
torches
across
each
slanted
the
rain
all
else
was
of
inky
blackness
except
where
between
them
and
me
a
faint
red
reflection
shone
on
the
wet
rocks
then
i
turned
inside
now
to
judge
from
the
crumbling
powder
of
the
footing
that
cave
had
been
dry
since
noah
in
fact
its
roof
was
nearly
a
thousand
feet
thick
but
since
we
had
spread
our
blankets
the
persistent
waters
had
soaked
down
and
through
the
roof
had
a
sprung
a
leak
three
separate
and
distinct
streams
of
water
ran
as
from
spigots
i
lowered
my
torch
the
canvas
tarpaulin
shone
with
wet
and
in
its
exact
centre
glimmered
a
pool
of
water
three
inches
deep
and
at
least
two
feet
in
diameter
well
i
be
i
began
then
i
remembered
those
three
wending
their
way
along
a
wet
and
disagreeable
trail
happy
and
peaceful
in
anticipation
of
warm
blankets
and
a
level
floor
i
chuckled
and
sat
on
my
heels
out
of
the
drip
first
came
jed
parker
his
head
bent
to
protect
the
fire
in
his
pipe
he
gained
the
very
centre
of
the
cave
before
he
looked
up
then
he
cast
one
glance
at
each
bed
and
one
at
me
his
grave
features
relaxed
a
faint
grin
appeared
under
his
long
moustache
without
a
word
he
squatted
down
beside
me
next
the
cattleman
he
looked
about
him
with
a
comical
expression
of
dismay
and
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
i
believe
i
said
i
was
sorry
for
those
other
fellows
he
remarked
windy
bill
was
the
last
he
stooped
his
head
to
enter
straightened
his
lank
figure
and
took
in
the
situation
without
expression
well
this
is
handy
said
he
i
was
gettin
dry
and
was
thinkin
i
would
have
to
climb
way
down
to
the
creek
in
all
this
rain
he
stooped
to
the
pool
in
the
centre
of
the
tarpaulin
and
drank
but
now
our
torches
began
to
run
low
a
small
dry
bush
grew
near
the
entrance
we
ignited
it
and
while
it
blazed
we
hastily
sorted
a
blanket
apiece
and
tumbled
the
rest
out
of
the
drip
our
return
without
torches
along
the
base
of
that
butte
was
something
to
remember
the
night
was
so
thick
you
could
feel
the
darkness
pressing
on
you
the
mountain
dropped
abruptly
to
the
left
and
was
strewn
with
boulders
and
blocks
of
stone
collisions
and
stumbles
were
frequent
once
i
stepped
off
a
little
ledge
five
or
six
feet
nothing
worse
than
a
barked
shin
and
all
the
while
the
rain
pelting
us
unmercifully
searched
out
what
poor
little
remnants
of
dryness
we
had
been
able
to
retain
at
last
we
opened
out
the
gleam
of
fire
in
our
cave
and
a
minute
later
were
engaged
in
struggling
desperately
up
the
slant
that
brought
us
to
our
ledge
and
the
slope
on
which
our
fire
burned
my
lord
panted
windy
bill
a
man
had
ought
to
have
hooks
on
his
eyebrows
to
climb
up
here
we
renewed
the
fire
and
blessed
the
of
mesquite
we
had
packed
up
earlier
in
the
evening
our
blankets
we
wrapped
around
our
shoulders
our
feet
we
hung
over
the
ledge
toward
the
blaze
our
backs
we
leaned
against
the
hollow
slant
of
the
cave
wall
we
were
not
uncomfortable
the
beat
of
the
rain
sprang
up
in
the
darkness
growing
louder
and
louder
like
horsemen
passing
on
a
hard
road
gradually
we
dozed
off
for
a
time
everything
was
pleasant
dreams
came
fused
with
realities
the
firelight
faded
from
consciousness
or
returned
fantastic
to
our
a
delicious
numbness
overspread
our
tired
bodies
the
shadows
leaped
became
solid
monstrous
we
fell
asleep
after
a
time
the
fact
obtruded
itself
dimly
through
our
stupor
that
the
constant
pressure
of
the
hard
rock
had
impeded
our
circulation
we
stirred
uneasily
shifting
to
a
better
position
that
was
the
beginning
of
awakening
the
new
position
did
not
suit
a
slight
shivering
seized
us
which
the
drawing
closer
of
the
blanket
failed
to
end
finally
i
threw
aside
my
hat
and
looked
out
jed
parker
a
vivid
comforter
wrapped
about
his
shoulders
stood
upright
and
silent
by
the
fire
i
kept
still
fearing
to
awaken
the
others
in
a
short
time
i
became
aware
that
the
others
were
doing
identically
the
same
thing
we
laughed
threw
off
our
blankets
stretched
and
fed
the
fire
a
thick
acrid
smoke
filled
the
air
the
cattleman
rising
left
a
trail
of
incandescent
footprints
we
investigated
hastily
and
discovered
that
the
supposed
earth
on
the
slant
of
the
cave
was
nothing
more
than
bat
guano
tons
of
it
the
fire
eating
its
way
beneath
had
rendered
untenable
its
immediate
vicinity
we
felt
as
though
we
were
living
over
a
volcano
how
soon
our
ledge
of
the
same
material
might
be
attacked
we
had
no
means
of
knowing
overcome
with
drowsiness
we
again
disposed
our
blankets
resolved
to
get
as
many
naps
as
possible
before
even
these
constrained
quarters
were
taken
from
us
this
happened
sooner
and
in
a
manner
otherwise
than
we
had
expected
windy
bill
brought
us
to
consciousness
by
a
wild
yell
consciousness
reported
to
us
a
strange
hurried
sound
like
the
long
roll
on
a
drum
investigation
showed
us
that
this
cave
too
had
sprung
a
leak
not
with
any
premonitory
drip
but
all
at
once
as
though
someone
had
turned
on
a
faucet
in
ten
seconds
a
very
competent
streamlet
six
inches
wide
had
eroded
a
course
down
through
the
guano
past
the
fire
and
to
the
outer
slope
and
by
the
irony
of
fate
that
one
and
only
one
leak
in
all
the
roof
expanse
of
a
big
cave
was
directly
over
one
end
of
our
tiny
ledge
the
cattleman
laughed
reminds
me
of
the
old
farmer
and
his
kind
friend
said
he
kind
friend
hunts
up
the
old
farmer
in
the
village
says
he
bad
news
for
you
your
barn
has
burned
up
lord
says
the
farmer
that
ai
the
worst
your
cow
was
burned
too
lord
says
the
farmer
that
ai
the
worst
your
horses
were
burned
lord
says
the
farmer
that
ai
the
worst
the
barn
set
fire
to
the
house
and
it
was
burned
total
loss
lord
groans
the
farmer
that
ai
the
worst
your
wife
and
child
were
killed
too
that
the
farmer
began
to
roar
with
laughter
heavens
man
cries
his
friend
astonished
in
the
world
do
you
find
to
laugh
at
in
that
you
see
answers
the
farmer
it
so
darn
complete
well
finished
the
cattleman
that
what
strikes
me
about
our
case
it
so
darn
complete
what
time
is
it
asked
windy
bill
midnight
i
announced
lord
six
hours
to
day
groaned
windy
bill
how
you
like
to
be
doin
a
nice
quiet
job
at
gardenin
in
the
east
where
you
could
belly
up
to
the
bar
every
evenin
and
drink
a
pussy
cafe
and
smoke
cigareets
you
would
like
it
a
bit
put
in
the
cattleman
with
decision
whereupon
in
proof
he
told
us
the
following
story
windy
has
mentioned
gentleman
tim
and
that
reminded
me
of
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
him
he
was
an
irishman
all
right
but
he
had
been
educated
in
england
and
except
for
his
accent
he
was
more
an
englishman
than
anything
else
a
freight
outfit
brought
him
into
tucson
from
santa
fe
and
dumped
him
down
on
the
plaza
where
at
once
every
idler
in
town
gathered
to
quiz
him
certainly
he
was
one
of
the
greenest
specimens
i
ever
saw
in
this
country
he
had
on
a
pair
of
balloon
pants
and
a
norfolk
jacket
and
was
surrounded
by
a
baby
trunks
his
face
was
and
aggressively
clean
and
his
eye
limpid
as
a
child
most
of
those
present
thought
that
indicated
childishness
but
i
could
see
that
it
was
only
utter
it
seemed
that
he
was
out
for
big
game
and
intended
to
go
after
somewhere
in
these
very
mountains
of
course
he
was
offered
plenty
of
advice
and
would
probably
have
made
engagements
much
to
be
regretted
had
i
not
taken
a
strong
fancy
to
him
my
friend
said
i
drawing
him
aside
i
do
want
to
be
inquisitive
but
what
might
you
do
when
you
home
i
a
younger
son
said
he
i
was
green
myself
in
those
days
and
knew
nothing
of
primogeniture
that
is
a
very
interesting
piece
of
family
history
said
i
but
it
does
not
answer
my
question
he
smiled
well
now
i
had
thought
of
that
said
he
but
in
a
manner
of
speaking
it
does
i
do
nothing
well
said
i
unabashed
if
you
saw
me
trying
to
be
a
younger
son
and
likely
to
forget
myself
and
do
something
without
meaning
to
would
you
be
apt
to
warn
me
well
honour
you
a
queer
chap
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
if
you
hire
any
of
those
men
to
guide
you
in
the
mountains
you
be
outrageously
cheated
and
will
be
lucky
if
not
gobbled
by
apaches
do
you
do
any
guiding
yourself
now
he
asked
most
innocent
of
manner
but
i
flared
up
you
damn
ungrateful
pup
i
said
go
to
the
devil
in
your
own
way
and
turned
square
on
my
heel
but
the
young
man
was
at
my
elbow
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
oh
i
say
now
i
sorry
i
did
rightly
understand
do
wait
one
moment
until
i
dispose
of
these
boxes
of
mine
and
then
i
want
the
honour
of
your
further
acquaintance
he
got
some
greasers
to
take
his
trunks
over
to
the
hotel
then
linked
his
arm
in
mine
most
engagingly
now
my
dear
chap
said
he
let
go
somewhere
for
a
b
s
and
find
out
about
each
other
we
were
both
young
and
expansive
we
exchanged
views
names
and
confidences
and
before
noon
we
had
arranged
to
hunt
together
i
to
collect
the
outfit
the
upshot
of
the
matter
was
that
the
honourable
timothy
clare
and
i
had
a
most
excellent
month
excursion
shot
several
good
bear
and
returned
to
tucson
the
best
of
friends
at
tucson
was
schiefflein
and
his
stories
of
a
big
strike
down
in
the
apache
country
nothing
would
do
but
that
we
should
both
go
to
see
for
ourselves
we
joined
the
second
expedition
crept
in
the
gullies
tied
bushes
about
ourselves
when
monumenting
corners
and
so
helped
establish
the
town
of
tombstone
we
made
nothing
nor
attempted
to
neither
of
us
knew
anything
of
mining
but
we
were
both
thirsty
for
adventure
and
took
a
schoolboy
delight
in
playing
the
game
of
life
or
death
with
the
chiricahuas
in
fact
i
never
saw
anybody
take
to
the
wild
life
as
eagerly
as
the
honourable
timothy
clare
he
wanted
to
attempt
everything
with
him
it
was
no
sooner
see
than
try
and
he
had
such
an
abundance
of
enthusiasm
that
he
generally
succeeded
the
balloon
pants
soon
went
in
a
month
his
outfit
was
irreproachable
he
used
to
study
us
by
the
hour
taking
in
every
detail
of
our
equipment
from
the
smallest
to
the
most
important
then
he
asked
questions
for
all
his
desire
to
be
one
of
the
country
he
was
never
ashamed
to
acknowledge
his
ignorance
now
do
you
chaps
think
it
silly
to
wear
such
high
heels
to
your
boots
he
would
ask
it
seems
to
me
a
very
useless
sort
of
vanity
no
vanity
about
it
tim
i
explained
in
the
first
place
it
keeps
your
foot
from
slipping
through
the
stirrup
in
the
second
place
it
is
good
to
grip
on
the
ground
when
you
roping
afoot
by
jove
that
true
he
cried
so
he
get
him
a
pair
of
boots
for
a
while
it
was
enough
to
wear
and
own
all
these
things
he
seemed
to
delight
in
his
and
his
rope
just
as
ornaments
to
himself
and
horse
but
he
soon
got
over
that
then
he
had
to
learn
to
use
them
for
the
time
being
pistol
practice
for
instance
would
absorb
all
his
thoughts
he
bang
away
at
intervals
all
day
and
figure
out
new
theories
all
night
that
bally
scheme
wo
work
he
would
complain
i
believe
if
i
extended
my
thumb
along
the
cylinder
it
would
help
that
side
jump
he
was
always
easing
the
or
filing
the
sights
in
time
he
got
to
be
a
fairly
accurate
and
very
quick
shot
the
same
way
with
roping
and
and
all
the
rest
what
the
use
i
used
to
ask
him
if
you
were
going
to
be
a
buckeroo
you
could
go
into
harder
training
i
like
it
was
always
his
answer
he
had
only
one
real
vice
that
i
could
see
he
would
gamble
stud
poker
was
his
favourite
and
i
never
saw
a
britisher
yet
who
could
play
poker
i
used
to
head
him
off
when
i
could
and
he
was
always
grateful
but
the
passion
was
strong
after
we
got
back
from
founding
tombstone
i
was
busted
and
had
to
go
to
work
i
got
plenty
said
tim
and
it
all
yours
i
know
old
fellow
i
told
him
but
your
money
would
do
for
me
buck
johnson
was
just
seeing
his
chance
then
and
was
preparing
to
take
some
breeding
cattle
over
into
the
soda
springs
valley
everybody
laughed
at
him
said
it
was
right
in
the
line
of
the
chiricahua
raids
which
was
true
but
buck
had
been
in
there
with
agency
steers
and
thought
he
knew
so
he
collected
a
trail
crew
brought
some
oregon
cattle
across
and
built
his
home
ranch
of
adobe
walls
with
portholes
i
joined
the
trail
crew
and
somehow
or
another
the
honourable
timothy
got
permission
to
go
along
on
his
own
hook
the
trail
was
a
long
one
we
had
thirst
and
heat
and
stampedes
and
some
indian
scares
but
in
the
queer
atmospheric
conditions
that
prevailed
that
summer
i
never
saw
the
desert
more
wonderful
it
was
like
waking
to
the
glory
of
god
to
sit
up
at
dawn
and
see
the
colours
change
on
the
dry
ranges
at
the
home
ranch
again
tim
managed
to
get
permission
to
stay
on
he
kept
his
own
mount
of
horses
took
care
of
them
hunted
and
took
part
in
all
the
cow
work
we
lost
some
cattle
from
indians
of
course
but
it
was
too
near
the
reservation
for
them
to
do
more
than
pick
up
a
few
stray
head
on
their
way
through
the
troops
were
always
after
them
full
jump
and
so
they
never
had
time
to
round
up
the
beef
but
of
course
we
had
to
look
out
or
we
lose
our
hair
and
many
a
cowboy
has
won
out
to
the
home
ranch
in
an
almighty
exciting
race
this
was
nuts
for
the
honourable
timothy
clare
much
better
than
hunting
and
he
enjoyed
it
no
limit
things
went
along
that
way
for
some
time
until
one
evening
as
i
was
turning
out
the
horses
a
buckboard
drew
in
and
from
it
descended
tony
briggs
and
a
dapper
little
fellow
dressed
all
in
black
and
with
a
plug
hat
which
i
accounts
for
said
hat
reachin
the
ranch
because
it
friday
and
the
boys
not
in
town
tony
whispered
to
me
as
i
happened
to
be
the
only
man
in
sight
the
stranger
addressed
me
i
am
looking
said
he
in
a
peculiar
manner
i
have
since
learned
to
be
english
for
the
honourable
timothy
clare
is
he
here
oh
you
looking
for
him
are
you
said
i
and
who
might
you
be
you
see
i
liked
tim
and
i
did
intend
to
deliver
him
over
into
trouble
the
man
picked
a
pair
of
off
his
stomach
where
they
dangled
at
the
end
of
a
chain
perched
them
on
his
nose
and
stared
me
over
i
must
have
looked
uncompromising
for
after
a
few
seconds
he
abruptly
wrinkled
his
nose
so
that
the
glasses
fell
promptly
to
his
stomach
again
felt
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
produced
a
card
i
took
it
and
read
jeffries
case
barrister
a
lawyer
said
i
suspiciously
my
dear
man
he
rejoined
with
a
slight
impatience
i
am
not
here
to
do
your
young
friend
a
harm
in
fact
my
firm
have
been
his
family
solicitors
for
generations
very
well
i
agreed
and
led
the
way
to
the
adobe
that
tim
and
i
occupied
if
i
had
expected
an
enthusiastic
greeting
for
the
boyhood
friend
from
the
old
home
i
would
have
been
disappointed
tim
was
sitting
with
his
back
to
the
door
reading
an
old
magazine
when
we
entered
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
ah
case
said
he
and
went
on
reading
after
a
moment
he
said
without
looking
up
sit
down
the
little
man
took
it
calmly
deposited
himself
in
a
chair
and
his
bag
between
his
feet
and
looked
about
him
daintily
at
our
rough
quarters
i
made
a
move
to
go
whereupon
tim
laid
down
his
magazine
yawned
stretched
his
arms
over
his
head
and
sighed
do
go
harry
he
begged
well
case
he
addressed
the
barrister
what
is
it
this
time
must
be
something
devilish
important
to
bring
you
how
many
thousand
miles
is
it
into
such
a
country
as
this
it
is
important
clare
stated
the
lawyer
in
his
dry
tones
but
my
journey
might
have
been
avoided
had
you
paid
some
attention
to
my
letters
letters
repeated
tim
opening
his
eyes
my
dear
chap
i
had
no
letters
addressed
as
usual
to
your
new
york
bankers
tim
laughed
softly
where
they
are
with
my
last
two
allowance
i
especially
instructed
them
to
send
me
no
mail
one
spends
no
money
in
this
country
he
paused
pulling
his
moustache
i
truly
sorry
you
had
to
come
so
far
he
continued
and
if
your
business
is
as
i
suspect
the
old
one
of
inducing
me
to
return
to
my
dear
uncle
arms
i
assure
you
the
mission
will
prove
quite
fruitless
uncle
hillary
and
i
could
never
live
in
the
same
county
let
alone
the
same
house
and
yet
your
uncle
the
viscount
mar
was
very
fond
of
you
ventured
case
your
allowances
oh
i
grant
you
his
generosity
in
money
affairs
he
has
continued
that
generosity
in
the
terms
of
his
will
and
those
terms
i
am
here
to
communicate
to
you
uncle
hillary
is
dead
cried
tim
he
passed
away
the
sixteenth
of
last
june
a
slight
pause
ensued
i
am
ready
to
hear
you
said
tim
soberly
at
last
the
barrister
stooped
and
began
to
fumble
with
his
bag
no
not
that
cried
tim
with
some
impatience
tell
me
in
your
own
words
the
lawyer
sat
back
and
pressed
his
finger
points
together
over
his
stomach
the
late
viscount
said
he
has
been
graciously
pleased
to
leave
you
in
fee
simple
his
entire
estate
of
staghurst
together
with
its
buildings
rentals
and
privileges
this
besides
the
residential
rights
amounts
to
some
ten
thousands
pounds
sterling
per
annum
a
little
less
than
fifty
thousand
dollars
a
year
harry
tim
shot
over
his
shoulder
at
me
there
is
one
condition
put
in
the
lawyer
oh
there
is
exclaimed
tim
his
crest
falling
well
knowing
my
uncle
hillary
the
condition
is
not
extravagant
the
lawyer
hastily
interposed
it
merely
entails
continued
residence
in
england
and
a
minimum
of
nine
months
on
the
estate
this
provision
is
absolute
and
the
estate
reverts
in
its
discontinuance
but
may
i
be
permitted
to
observe
that
the
majority
of
men
myself
among
the
number
are
content
to
spend
the
most
of
their
lives
not
merely
in
the
confines
of
a
kingdom
but
between
the
four
walls
of
a
room
for
much
less
than
ten
thousand
pounds
a
year
also
that
england
is
not
without
its
attractions
for
an
englishman
and
that
staghurst
is
a
country
place
of
many
possibilities
the
honourable
timothy
had
recovered
from
his
first
surprise
and
if
the
conditions
are
not
complied
with
he
inquired
then
the
estate
reverts
to
the
heirs
at
law
and
you
receive
an
annuity
of
one
hundred
pounds
payable
quarterly
may
i
ask
further
the
reason
for
this
extraordinary
condition
my
distinguished
client
never
informed
me
replied
the
lawyer
but
and
a
twinkle
appeared
in
his
eye
as
an
occasional
disburser
of
funds
monte
carlo
tim
burst
out
laughing
oh
but
i
recognise
uncle
hillary
there
he
cried
well
case
i
am
sure
johnson
the
owner
of
this
ranch
can
put
you
up
and
we
start
back
he
returned
after
a
few
minutes
to
find
me
sitting
smoking
a
moody
pipe
i
liked
tim
and
i
was
sorry
to
have
him
go
then
too
i
was
ruffled
in
the
senseless
manner
of
youth
by
the
sudden
altitude
to
which
his
changed
fortunes
had
lifted
him
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
surveying
me
then
came
across
and
laid
his
arm
on
my
shoulder
well
i
growled
without
looking
up
you
a
very
rich
man
now
mr
clare
at
that
he
jerked
me
bodily
out
of
my
seat
and
stood
me
up
in
the
centre
of
the
room
the
irish
blazing
out
of
his
eyes
here
none
of
that
he
snapped
you
damn
little
fool
do
you
clare
me
so
in
five
minutes
we
were
talking
it
over
tim
was
very
much
excited
at
the
prospect
he
knew
staghurst
well
and
told
me
all
about
the
big
stone
house
and
the
avenue
through
the
trees
and
the
roads
and
the
lawn
with
its
peacocks
and
the
round
green
hills
and
the
labourers
cottages
it
home
said
he
and
i
did
realise
before
how
much
i
wanted
to
see
it
and
i
be
a
man
of
weight
there
harry
and
it
be
mighty
good
we
made
all
sorts
of
plans
as
to
how
i
was
going
to
visit
him
just
as
soon
as
i
could
get
together
the
money
for
the
passage
he
had
the
delicacy
not
to
offer
to
let
me
have
it
and
that
clinched
my
trust
and
love
of
him
the
next
day
he
drove
away
with
tony
and
the
dapper
little
lawyer
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
that
i
watched
the
buckboard
until
it
disappeared
in
the
mirage
i
was
with
buck
johnson
all
that
summer
and
the
following
winter
as
well
we
had
our
first
found
the
natural
increase
much
in
excess
of
the
loss
by
indians
and
extended
our
holdings
up
over
the
rock
creek
country
we
witnessed
the
start
of
many
indian
campaigns
participated
in
a
few
little
brushes
with
the
chiricahuas
saw
the
beginning
of
the
a
man
had
not
much
opportunity
to
think
of
anything
but
what
he
had
right
on
hand
but
i
found
time
for
a
few
speculations
on
tim
i
wondered
how
he
looked
now
and
what
he
was
doing
and
how
in
blazes
he
managed
to
get
away
with
fifty
thousand
a
year
and
then
one
sunday
in
june
while
i
was
lying
on
my
bunk
tim
pushed
open
the
door
and
walked
in
i
was
young
but
i
seen
a
lot
and
i
knew
the
expression
of
his
face
so
i
laid
low
and
said
nothing
in
a
minute
the
door
opened
again
and
buck
johnson
himself
came
in
how
do
said
he
i
saw
you
ride
up
how
do
you
do
replied
tim
i
know
all
about
you
said
buck
without
any
preliminaries
your
man
case
has
wrote
me
i
do
know
your
reasons
and
i
do
want
to
know
it
none
of
my
business
and
i
ai
goin
to
tell
you
just
what
kind
of
a
damn
fool
i
think
you
are
that
none
of
my
business
either
but
i
want
you
to
understand
without
question
how
you
stand
on
the
ranch
quite
good
sir
said
tim
very
quietly
when
you
were
out
here
before
i
was
glad
to
have
you
here
as
a
sort
of
guest
then
you
were
what
i
heerd
called
a
gentleman
of
leisure
now
you
nothin
but
a
remittance
man
your
money
nothin
to
me
but
the
principle
of
the
thing
is
the
country
is
plumb
pestered
with
remittance
men
doin
nothin
and
i
do
aim
to
run
no
home
for
incompetents
i
had
a
son
of
a
duke
drivin
wagon
for
me
and
he
could
drive
nails
in
a
snowbanks
so
do
you
herd
up
with
the
idea
that
you
can
come
on
this
ranch
and
loaf
i
do
want
to
loaf
put
in
tim
i
want
a
job
i
willing
to
give
you
a
job
replied
buck
but
it
jest
an
ordinary
job
at
forty
a
month
and
if
you
do
fill
your
saddle
it
goes
to
someone
else
that
satisfactory
agreed
tim
all
right
finished
buck
so
that
understood
your
friend
case
wanted
me
to
give
you
a
lot
of
advice
a
man
generally
has
about
as
much
use
for
advice
as
a
cow
has
for
four
hind
legs
he
went
out
for
god
sake
what
up
i
cried
leaping
from
my
bunk
hullo
harry
said
he
as
though
he
had
seen
me
the
day
before
come
back
how
come
back
i
asked
i
thought
you
could
leave
the
estate
have
they
broken
the
will
no
said
he
is
the
money
lost
no
then
what
the
long
and
short
of
it
is
that
i
could
afford
that
estate
and
that
money
what
do
you
mean
i
given
it
up
given
it
up
what
for
to
come
back
here
i
took
this
all
in
slowly
tim
clare
said
i
at
last
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
have
given
up
an
english
estate
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
a
year
to
be
a
remittance
man
at
five
hundred
and
a
on
as
much
more
exactly
said
he
tim
i
adjured
him
solemnly
you
are
a
damn
fool
maybe
he
agreed
why
did
you
do
it
i
begged
he
walked
to
the
door
and
looked
out
across
the
desert
to
where
the
mountains
hovered
like
on
the
horizon
for
a
long
time
he
looked
then
whirled
on
me
harry
said
he
in
a
low
voice
do
you
remember
the
camp
we
made
on
the
shoulder
of
the
mountain
that
night
we
were
caught
out
and
do
you
remember
how
the
dawn
came
up
on
the
big
snow
peaks
across
the
way
and
all
the
canon
below
us
filled
with
whirling
mists
and
the
steel
stars
leaving
us
one
by
one
where
could
i
find
room
for
that
in
english
paddocks
and
do
you
recall
the
day
we
trailed
across
the
yuma
deserts
and
the
sun
beat
into
our
skulls
and
the
dry
brittle
hills
looked
like
and
the
grey
ran
off
into
the
rise
of
the
hills
and
then
came
sunset
and
the
hard
dry
mountains
grew
filmy
like
gauze
veils
of
many
colours
and
melted
and
glowed
and
faded
to
slate
blue
and
the
stars
came
out
the
english
hills
are
rounded
and
green
and
curried
and
the
sky
is
near
and
the
stars
only
a
few
miles
up
and
do
you
recollect
that
dark
night
when
old
loco
and
his
warriors
were
camped
at
the
base
of
cochise
stronghold
and
we
crept
down
through
the
velvet
dark
wondering
when
we
would
be
discovered
our
mouths
sticky
with
excitement
and
the
little
winds
blowing
he
walked
up
and
down
a
times
his
breast
heaving
it
all
very
well
for
the
man
who
is
brought
up
to
it
and
who
has
seen
nothing
else
case
can
exist
in
four
walls
he
has
been
brought
up
to
it
and
knows
nothing
different
but
a
man
like
me
they
wanted
me
to
canter
between
i
who
have
ridden
the
desert
where
the
sky
over
me
and
the
plain
under
me
were
bigger
than
the
islander
universe
they
wanted
me
to
oversee
little
farms
i
who
have
watched
the
sun
rising
over
half
a
world
talk
of
your
ten
a
year
and
what
it
buy
you
know
harry
how
it
feels
when
a
steer
takes
the
slack
of
your
rope
and
your
pony
sits
back
where
in
england
can
i
buy
that
you
know
the
rising
and
the
falling
of
days
and
the
boundless
spaces
where
your
heart
grows
big
and
the
thirst
of
the
desert
and
the
hunger
of
the
trail
and
a
sun
that
shines
and
fills
the
sky
and
a
wind
that
blows
fresh
from
the
wide
places
where
in
parcelled
snug
green
tight
little
england
could
i
buy
that
with
ten
thou
aye
or
an
hundred
times
ten
thou
no
no
harry
that
fortune
would
cost
me
too
dear
i
have
seen
and
done
and
been
too
much
come
back
to
the
big
country
where
the
pay
is
poor
and
the
work
is
hard
and
the
comfort
small
but
where
a
man
and
his
soul
meet
their
maker
face
to
face
the
cattleman
had
finished
his
yarn
for
a
time
no
one
spoke
outside
the
volume
of
rain
was
subsiding
windy
bill
reported
a
few
stars
shining
through
rifts
in
the
showers
the
chill
that
precedes
the
dawn
brought
us
as
close
to
the
fire
as
the
smouldering
guano
would
permit
i
do
know
whether
he
was
right
or
wrong
mused
the
cattleman
after
a
while
a
man
can
do
a
heap
with
that
much
money
and
yet
an
old
is
never
happy
anywhere
else
however
he
concluded
emphatically
one
thing
i
do
know
rain
cold
hunger
discomfort
curses
kicks
and
violent
deaths
included
there
is
one
of
you
grumblers
who
would
hold
that
gardening
job
you
spoke
of
three
days
chapter
four
the
cattle
rustlers
dawn
broke
so
we
descended
through
wet
grasses
to
the
canon
there
after
some
difficulty
we
managed
to
start
a
fire
and
so
ate
breakfast
the
rain
still
pouring
down
on
us
about
nine
with
miraculous
suddenness
the
torrent
stopped
it
began
to
turn
cold
the
cattleman
and
i
decided
to
climb
to
the
top
of
the
butte
after
meat
which
we
entirely
lacked
it
was
rather
a
stiff
ascent
but
once
above
the
sheer
cliffs
we
found
ourselves
on
a
rolling
meadow
tableland
a
broad
by
perhaps
a
mile
and
a
half
in
length
grass
grew
high
here
and
there
were
small
live
oaks
planted
slight
and
rounded
ravines
accommodated
brooklets
as
we
walked
back
the
edges
blended
in
the
edges
of
the
mesa
across
the
canon
the
deep
gorges
which
had
heretofore
seemed
the
most
prominent
elements
of
the
scenery
were
lost
we
stood
apparently
in
the
middle
of
a
wide
and
undulating
plain
diversified
by
little
ridges
and
running
with
a
free
sweep
to
the
very
foot
of
the
snowy
galiuros
it
seemed
as
though
we
should
be
able
to
ride
horseback
in
almost
any
given
direction
yet
we
knew
that
ten
minutes
walk
would
take
us
to
the
brink
of
most
stupendous
chasms
so
deep
that
the
water
flowing
in
them
hardly
seemed
to
move
so
rugged
that
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
could
a
horseman
make
his
way
through
the
country
at
all
and
yet
so
ancient
that
the
bottoms
supported
forests
rich
grasses
and
rounded
gentle
knolls
it
was
a
most
astonishing
set
of
double
impressions
we
succeeded
in
killing
a
nice
fat
buck
and
so
returned
to
camp
happy
the
rain
held
off
we
dug
ditches
organised
shelters
cooked
a
warm
meal
for
the
next
day
we
planned
a
bear
hunt
afoot
far
up
a
manzanita
canon
where
uncle
jim
knew
of
some
holing
up
caves
but
when
we
awoke
in
the
morning
we
threw
aside
our
coverings
with
some
difficulty
to
look
on
a
ground
covered
with
snow
trees
laden
almost
to
the
breaking
point
with
snow
and
the
air
filled
with
it
no
bear
today
said
the
cattleman
no
agreed
uncle
jim
drily
no
and
what
more
unless
aimin
to
stop
here
somewhat
of
a
spell
we
have
to
make
out
we
cooked
with
freezing
fingers
ate
while
dodging
avalanches
from
the
trees
and
packed
reluctantly
the
ropes
were
frozen
the
hobbles
stiff
everything
either
crackling
or
wet
finally
the
task
was
finished
we
took
a
last
warming
of
the
fingers
and
climbed
on
the
country
was
wonderfully
beautiful
with
the
white
not
yet
shaken
from
the
trees
and
rock
ledges
also
it
was
wonderfully
slippery
the
snow
was
soft
enough
to
ball
under
the
horses
hoofs
so
that
most
of
the
time
the
poor
animals
skated
and
stumbled
along
on
stilts
thus
we
made
our
way
back
over
ground
which
naked
of
these
difficulties
we
had
considered
bad
enough
imagine
riding
along
a
slant
of
rock
shelving
off
to
a
bad
tumble
so
steep
that
your
pony
has
to
do
more
or
less
expert
ankle
work
to
keep
from
slipping
off
sideways
during
the
passage
of
that
rock
you
are
apt
to
sit
very
light
now
cover
it
with
several
inches
of
snow
stick
a
snowball
on
each
hoof
of
your
mount
and
try
again
when
you
have
ridden
it
or
its
duplicate
a
few
score
of
times
select
a
steep
mountain
side
cover
it
with
round
rocks
the
size
of
your
head
and
over
that
spread
a
concealing
blanket
of
the
same
sticky
snow
you
are
privileged
to
vary
these
to
the
limits
of
your
imagination
once
across
the
divide
we
ran
into
a
new
sort
of
trouble
you
may
remember
that
on
our
journey
over
we
had
been
forced
to
travel
for
some
distance
in
a
narrow
during
our
passage
we
had
scrambled
up
some
rather
steep
and
rough
slopes
and
hopped
up
some
fairly
high
ledges
now
we
found
the
heretofore
dry
bed
flowing
a
good
eight
inches
deep
the
steep
slopes
had
become
cascades
the
ledges
waterfalls
when
we
came
to
them
we
had
to
shoot
the
rapids
as
best
we
could
only
to
land
with
a
plunk
in
an
indeterminately
deep
pool
at
the
bottom
some
of
the
pack
horses
went
down
sousing
again
our
unfortunate
bedding
but
by
the
grace
of
fortune
not
a
saddle
pony
lost
his
feet
after
a
time
the
gorge
widened
we
came
out
into
the
box
canon
with
its
trees
here
the
water
spread
and
shoaled
to
a
depth
of
only
two
or
three
inches
we
splashed
along
gaily
enough
for
with
the
exception
of
an
occasional
quicksand
or
boggy
spot
our
troubles
were
over
jed
parker
and
i
happened
to
ride
side
by
side
bringing
up
the
rear
and
seeing
to
it
that
the
pack
animals
did
not
stray
or
linger
as
we
passed
the
first
of
the
rustlers
corrals
he
called
my
attention
to
them
go
take
a
look
said
he
we
only
got
those
fellows
out
of
here
two
years
ago
i
rode
over
at
this
point
the
broke
to
admit
the
ingress
of
a
ravine
into
the
main
canon
riding
a
short
distance
up
the
ravine
i
could
see
that
it
ended
abruptly
in
a
perpendicular
cliff
as
the
sides
also
were
precipitous
it
became
necessary
only
to
build
a
fence
across
the
entrance
into
the
main
canon
to
become
possessed
of
a
corral
completely
closed
in
remembering
the
absolute
invisibility
of
these
sunken
canons
until
the
rider
is
almost
directly
over
them
and
also
the
extreme
roughness
and
remoteness
of
the
district
i
could
see
that
the
spot
was
admirably
adapted
to
concealment
there
quite
a
yarn
about
the
gang
that
held
this
hole
said
jed
parker
to
me
when
i
had
ridden
back
to
him
i
tell
you
about
it
sometime
we
climbed
the
hill
descended
on
the
double
r
built
a
fire
in
the
stove
dried
out
and
were
happy
after
a
square
meal
and
a
dry
one
i
reminded
jed
parker
of
his
promise
and
so
sitting
on
his
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
he
told
us
the
following
yarn
there
a
good
deal
of
romance
been
written
about
the
bad
man
and
there
about
the
same
amount
of
nonsense
the
bad
man
is
justa
plain
murderer
neither
more
nor
less
he
never
does
get
into
a
real
good
plain
gunfight
if
he
can
possibly
help
it
his
killin
are
done
from
behind
a
door
or
when
he
got
his
man
dead
to
rights
there
sam
cook
you
all
heard
of
him
he
had
nerve
of
course
and
when
he
was
backed
into
a
corner
he
made
good
he
was
sure
sudden
death
with
a
gun
but
when
he
went
for
a
man
deliberate
he
take
no
special
chances
for
a
while
he
was
marshal
at
willets
pretty
soon
it
was
noted
that
there
was
a
heap
of
cases
of
resisting
arrest
where
sam
as
marshal
had
to
shoot
and
that
those
cases
almost
always
happened
to
be
his
personal
enemies
of
course
that
might
be
all
right
but
it
looked
suspicious
then
one
day
he
killed
poor
old
max
schmidt
out
behind
his
own
saloon
called
him
out
and
shot
him
in
the
stomach
said
max
resisted
arrest
on
a
warrant
for
keepin
open
out
of
hours
that
was
a
sweet
warrant
to
take
out
in
willets
anyway
schmidt
always
claimed
that
she
saw
that
deal
played
and
that
while
they
were
talkin
perfectly
peacable
cook
let
drive
from
the
hip
at
about
two
yards
range
anyway
we
decided
we
needed
another
marshal
nothin
else
was
ever
done
for
the
vigilantes
had
been
formed
and
your
individual
and
decent
citizen
does
care
to
be
marked
by
a
gun
of
that
stripe
leastwise
unless
he
wants
to
go
in
for
methods
and
do
a
little
ambusheein
on
his
own
account
the
point
is
that
these
yere
bad
men
are
a
miserable
proposition
and
plain
murderers
willin
to
wait
for
a
sure
thing
and
without
no
compunctions
whatsoever
the
bad
man
takes
you
unawares
when
you
sleepin
or
talkin
or
drinkin
or
to
see
what
for
a
day
it
goin
to
be
anyway
he
do
give
you
no
show
and
sooner
or
later
he
goin
to
get
you
in
the
safest
and
easiest
way
for
himself
there
ai
no
romance
about
that
and
until
you
seen
a
few
men
called
out
of
their
shacks
for
a
friendly
conversation
and
shot
when
they
happen
to
look
away
or
asked
for
a
drink
of
water
and
killed
when
they
stoop
to
the
spring
or
potted
from
behind
as
they
go
into
a
room
it
pretty
hard
to
believe
that
any
man
can
be
so
plumb
lackin
in
fair
play
or
pity
or
just
natural
humanity
as
you
boys
know
i
come
in
from
texas
to
buck
johnson
about
ten
year
back
i
had
a
pretty
good
mount
of
ponies
that
i
knew
and
i
hated
to
let
them
go
at
prices
they
were
offerin
then
so
i
made
up
my
mind
to
ride
across
and
bring
them
in
with
me
it
was
so
awful
far
and
i
figured
that
i
like
to
take
in
what
new
mexico
looked
like
anyway
about
down
by
albuquerque
i
tracked
up
with
another
outfit
headed
my
way
there
was
five
of
them
three
men
and
a
woman
and
a
baby
they
had
a
dozen
hosses
and
that
was
about
all
i
could
see
there
was
only
two
packed
and
no
wagon
i
suppose
the
whole
outfit
pots
pans
and
kettles
was
worth
five
dollars
it
was
just
supper
when
i
run
across
them
and
it
did
take
one
look
to
discover
that
flour
coffee
sugar
and
salt
was
all
they
carried
a
yearlin
carcass
lay
near
and
the
was
full
of
meat
howdy
strangers
says
i
ridin
up
they
nodded
a
little
but
did
say
nothin
my
hosses
fell
to
grazin
and
i
eased
myself
around
in
my
saddle
and
made
a
cigareet
the
men
was
tall
lank
fellows
with
kind
of
sullen
faces
and
sly
shifty
eyes
the
woman
was
dirty
and
generally
mussed
up
i
knowed
that
sort
all
right
texas
was
gettin
too
many
fences
for
them
havin
supper
says
i
cheerful
one
of
grunted
yes
at
me
and
after
a
while
the
biggest
asked
me
very
grudgin
if
i
would
light
and
eat
i
told
them
no
that
i
was
travellin
in
the
cool
of
the
evenin
you
seem
to
have
more
meat
than
you
need
though
says
i
i
could
use
a
little
of
that
help
yourself
says
they
it
a
maverick
we
come
across
i
took
a
steak
and
noted
that
the
hide
had
been
mighty
well
cut
to
ribbons
around
the
flanks
and
that
the
head
was
gone
well
says
i
to
the
carcass
no
one
going
to
be
able
to
swear
whether
you
a
maverick
or
not
but
i
bet
you
knew
the
feel
of
a
brandin
iron
all
right
i
gave
them
a
and
climbed
on
again
my
hosses
acted
some
surprised
at
bein
gathered
up
again
but
i
could
help
that
it
looks
like
a
plumb
imposition
cavallos
says
i
to
them
after
an
but
you
sure
do
want
to
join
that
outfit
any
more
than
i
do
the
angels
and
if
we
camp
here
we
likely
to
do
both
i
did
see
them
any
more
after
that
until
i
hit
the
lazy
y
and
had
started
in
runnin
cattle
in
the
soda
springs
valley
larry
eagen
and
i
rode
together
those
days
and
that
how
i
got
to
know
him
pretty
well
one
day
over
in
the
elm
flat
we
ran
smack
on
this
texas
outfit
again
headed
north
this
time
i
was
on
my
own
range
and
i
knew
where
i
stood
so
i
could
show
a
little
more
curiosity
in
the
case
well
you
got
this
far
says
i
yes
says
they
where
you
headed
over
towards
the
hills
what
to
do
make
a
ranch
raise
some
truck
perhaps
buy
a
few
cows
they
went
on
truck
says
i
to
larry
is
fine
prospects
in
this
country
he
sat
on
his
horse
looking
after
them
i
sorry
for
them
says
he
it
must
he
almighty
hard
scratchin
well
we
rode
the
range
for
upwards
of
two
year
in
that
time
we
saw
our
texas
friends
name
of
hahn
two
or
three
times
in
willets
and
heard
of
them
off
and
on
they
bought
an
old
brand
of
steve
mcwilliams
for
dollars
carryin
six
or
eight
head
of
cows
after
that
from
time
to
time
we
heard
of
them
buying
more
two
or
three
head
from
one
man
and
two
or
three
from
another
they
branded
them
all
with
that
mcwilliams
iron
t
so
pretty
soon
we
began
to
see
the
cattle
on
the
range
now
a
good
cattleman
knows
cattle
just
as
well
as
you
know
people
and
he
can
tell
them
about
as
far
off
horned
critters
look
alike
to
you
but
even
in
a
country
supportin
a
good
many
thousand
head
a
man
used
to
the
business
can
recognise
most
every
individual
as
far
as
he
can
see
him
some
is
better
than
others
at
it
i
suppose
you
really
have
to
be
brought
up
to
it
so
we
boys
at
the
lazy
y
noted
all
the
cattle
with
the
new
t
and
could
estimate
pretty
close
that
the
hahn
outfit
might
own
maybe
head
all
told
that
was
all
very
well
and
nobody
had
any
kick
comin
then
one
day
in
the
spring
we
came
across
our
first
sleeper
what
a
sleeper
a
sleeper
is
a
calf
that
has
been
but
not
branded
every
owner
has
a
certain
brand
as
you
know
and
then
he
crops
and
slits
the
ears
in
a
certain
way
too
in
that
manner
he
do
have
to
look
at
the
brand
except
to
corroborate
the
ears
and
as
the
critter
generally
sticks
his
ears
up
to
anyone
ridin
up
it
easy
to
know
the
brand
without
lookin
at
it
merely
from
the
once
in
a
great
while
when
a
man
comes
across
an
unbranded
calf
and
it
ai
handy
to
build
a
fire
he
just
it
and
let
the
brandin
go
till
later
but
it
is
done
often
and
our
outfit
had
strict
orders
never
to
make
sleepers
well
one
day
in
the
spring
as
i
say
larry
and
me
was
ridin
when
we
came
across
a
lazy
y
cow
and
calf
the
little
fellow
was
all
right
so
we
rode
on
and
never
would
have
discovered
nothin
if
a
bush
rabbit
had
jumped
and
scared
the
calf
right
across
in
front
of
our
hosses
then
we
could
help
but
see
that
there
was
no
brand
of
course
we
roped
him
and
put
the
iron
on
him
i
took
the
chance
to
look
at
his
ears
and
saw
that
the
marking
had
been
done
quite
recent
so
when
we
got
in
that
night
i
reported
to
buck
johnson
that
one
of
the
punchers
was
gettin
lazy
and
sleeperin
naturally
he
went
after
the
man
who
had
done
it
but
every
puncher
swore
up
and
down
and
back
and
across
that
he
branded
every
calf
he
had
a
rope
on
that
spring
we
put
it
down
that
someone
was
lyin
and
let
it
go
at
that
and
then
about
a
week
later
one
of
the
other
boys
reported
a
sleeper
the
was
the
goodrich
brand
so
we
did
have
nothin
to
do
with
that
some
of
them
might
be
for
all
we
knew
three
other
cases
of
the
same
kind
we
happened
across
that
same
spring
so
far
so
good
sleepers
runnin
in
such
numbers
was
a
little
astonishin
but
nothin
suspicious
cattle
did
well
that
summer
and
when
we
come
to
round
up
in
the
fall
we
cut
out
maybe
a
dozen
of
those
t
cattle
that
had
strayed
out
of
that
hahn
country
of
the
dozen
there
was
five
grown
cows
and
seven
yearlin
my
lord
jed
says
buck
to
me
they
a
heap
of
these
youngsters
comin
over
our
way
but
still
as
a
young
critter
is
more
apt
to
stray
than
an
old
one
that
got
his
range
established
we
did
lay
no
great
store
by
that
neither
the
hahns
took
their
bunch
and
that
all
there
was
to
it
next
spring
though
we
found
a
few
more
sleepers
and
one
day
we
came
on
a
cow
that
had
gone
dead
lame
that
was
usual
too
but
buck
who
was
with
me
had
somethin
on
his
mind
finally
he
turned
back
and
roped
her
and
threw
her
look
here
jed
says
he
what
do
you
make
of
this
i
could
see
where
the
hind
legs
below
the
hocks
had
been
burned
looks
like
somebody
had
roped
her
by
the
hind
feet
says
i
might
be
says
he
but
her
heels
lame
that
way
makes
it
look
more
like
hobbles
so
we
did
say
nothin
more
about
that
neither
until
just
by
luck
we
came
on
another
lame
cow
we
threw
her
too
well
what
do
you
think
of
this
one
buck
johnson
asks
me
the
feet
is
pretty
well
tore
up
says
i
and
down
to
the
quick
but
i
seen
them
tore
up
just
as
bad
on
the
rocks
when
they
come
down
out
of
the
mountains
you
sabe
what
that
meant
do
you
you
see
a
rustler
will
take
a
cow
and
hobble
her
or
lame
her
so
she
ca
follow
and
then
take
her
calf
a
long
ways
off
and
brand
it
with
his
iron
of
course
if
we
was
to
see
a
calf
of
one
brand
followin
of
a
cow
with
another
it
would
be
just
too
easy
to
guess
what
had
happened
we
rode
on
mighty
thoughtful
there
could
be
much
doubt
that
cattle
rustlers
was
at
work
the
sleepers
they
had
hopin
that
no
one
would
discover
the
lack
of
a
brand
then
after
the
calf
was
weaned
and
quit
followin
of
his
mother
the
rustler
would
brand
it
with
his
own
iron
and
change
its
to
match
it
made
a
nice
easy
way
of
gettin
together
a
bunch
of
cattle
cheap
but
it
was
pretty
hard
to
guess
who
the
rustlers
might
be
there
were
a
lot
of
renegades
down
towards
the
mexican
line
who
made
a
raid
once
in
a
while
and
a
few
oilers
livin
near
had
water
holes
in
the
foothills
and
any
amount
of
little
cattle
holders
like
this
t
outfit
and
any
of
them
would
shy
very
hard
at
a
little
on
the
side
buck
johnson
told
us
all
to
watch
out
and
passed
the
word
quiet
among
the
big
owners
to
try
and
see
whose
cattle
seemed
to
have
too
many
calves
for
the
number
of
cows
the
texas
outfit
i
tellin
you
about
had
settled
up
above
in
this
double
r
canon
where
i
showed
you
those
natural
corrals
this
morning
they
built
them
a
and
cleared
some
land
and
planted
a
few
trees
and
made
an
irrigated
patch
for
alfalfa
nobody
never
rode
over
this
way
very
much
the
country
was
most
too
rough
for
cattle
and
our
ranges
lay
farther
to
the
southward
now
however
we
began
to
extend
our
ridin
a
little
i
was
down
towards
dos
cabesas
to
look
over
the
cattle
there
and
they
used
to
send
larry
up
into
the
double
r
country
one
evenin
he
took
me
to
one
side
look
here
jed
says
he
i
know
you
pretty
well
and
i
not
ashamed
to
say
that
i
all
new
at
this
cattle
business
in
fact
i
been
at
it
a
year
what
should
be
the
proportion
of
cows
to
calves
anyhow
there
ought
to
be
about
twice
as
many
cows
as
there
calves
i
tells
him
then
with
only
about
fifty
head
of
grown
cows
there
ought
not
to
be
an
equal
number
of
yearlin
i
should
say
not
says
i
what
are
you
drivin
at
nothin
yet
says
he
a
few
days
later
he
tackled
me
again
jed
says
he
i
not
good
like
you
fellows
are
at
knowin
one
cow
from
another
but
there
a
calf
down
there
branded
t
that
i
pretty
near
swear
i
saw
with
an
x
y
cow
last
month
i
wish
you
could
come
down
with
me
we
got
that
fixed
easy
enough
and
for
the
next
month
rammed
around
through
this
broken
country
lookin
for
evidence
i
saw
enough
to
satisfy
me
to
a
moral
certainty
but
nothin
for
a
sheriff
and
of
course
we
could
go
shoot
up
a
peaceful
rancher
on
mere
suspicion
finally
one
day
we
run
on
a
calf
all
by
himself
with
the
t
iron
onto
him
a
mighty
healthy
lookin
calf
too
wonder
where
his
mother
is
says
i
maybe
it
a
says
larry
eagen
we
calls
calves
whose
mothers
have
died
dogies
no
says
i
i
do
hardly
think
so
a
dogie
is
always
under
size
and
poor
and
he
layin
around
water
holes
and
he
always
has
a
big
sway
belly
onto
him
no
this
is
no
dogie
and
if
it
an
honest
calf
there
sure
ought
to
be
a
t
cow
around
somewhere
so
we
separated
to
have
a
good
look
larry
rode
up
on
the
edge
of
a
little
rimrock
in
a
minute
i
saw
his
hoss
jump
back
dodgin
a
rattlesnake
or
somethin
and
then
fall
back
out
of
sight
i
jumped
my
hoss
up
there
quick
and
looked
over
expectin
to
see
but
mangled
remains
it
was
only
about
fifteen
foot
down
but
i
could
see
bottom
of
some
brush
are
you
all
right
i
yells
yes
yes
cries
larry
but
for
the
love
of
god
get
down
here
as
quick
as
you
can
i
hopped
off
my
hoss
and
scrambled
down
somehow
hurt
says
i
as
soon
as
i
lit
not
a
bit
look
here
there
was
a
dead
cow
with
the
lazy
y
on
her
flank
and
a
in
her
forehead
adds
larry
and
look
here
that
t
calf
was
and
so
was
this
cow
reckon
we
found
our
sleepers
says
i
so
there
we
was
larry
had
to
lead
his
cavallo
down
the
barranca
to
the
main
canon
i
followed
along
on
the
rim
waitin
until
a
place
gave
me
a
chance
to
get
down
too
or
larry
a
chance
to
get
up
we
were
talkin
back
and
forth
when
all
at
once
larry
shouted
again
big
game
this
time
he
yells
here
a
cave
and
a
mountain
lion
squallin
in
it
i
slid
down
to
him
at
once
and
we
drew
our
and
went
up
to
the
cave
openin
right
under
the
there
sure
enough
were
fresh
lion
tracks
and
we
could
hear
a
little
faint
cryin
like
woman
first
chance
claims
larry
and
dropped
to
his
hands
and
knees
at
the
entrance
well
damn
me
he
cries
and
crawls
in
at
once
payin
no
attention
to
me
tellin
him
to
be
more
cautious
in
a
minute
he
backs
out
carryin
a
goat
we
seem
to
be
in
for
adventures
says
he
now
where
do
you
suppose
that
came
from
and
how
did
it
get
here
well
says
i
i
followed
lion
tracks
where
they
carried
yearlin
across
their
backs
like
a
fox
does
a
goose
they
strong
but
where
did
she
come
from
he
wonders
as
for
that
says
i
do
you
remember
now
that
t
outfit
had
a
yearlin
kid
when
it
came
into
the
country
that
right
says
he
it
only
a
mile
down
the
canon
i
take
it
home
they
must
be
most
distracted
about
it
so
i
scratched
up
to
the
top
where
my
pony
was
waitin
it
was
a
hard
climb
and
i
had
to
have
hooks
on
my
eyebrows
to
get
up
at
all
it
easier
to
slide
down
than
to
climb
back
i
dropped
my
gun
out
of
my
holster
and
she
went
way
to
the
bottom
but
i
have
gone
back
for
six
guns
larry
picked
it
up
for
me
so
we
went
along
me
on
the
and
around
the
barrancas
and
larry
in
the
bottom
carryin
of
the
kid
by
and
by
we
came
to
the
ranch
house
stopped
to
wait
the
minute
larry
hove
in
sight
everybody
was
out
to
once
and
in
two
winks
the
woman
had
that
baby
they
did
see
me
at
all
but
i
could
hear
plain
enough
what
they
said
larry
told
how
he
had
found
her
in
the
cave
and
all
about
the
lion
tracks
and
the
woman
cried
and
held
the
kid
close
to
her
and
thanked
him
about
forty
times
then
when
she
wore
the
edge
off
a
little
she
took
the
kid
inside
to
feed
it
or
somethin
well
says
larry
still
laughin
i
must
hit
the
trail
you
say
you
found
her
up
the
double
r
asks
hahn
was
it
that
cave
near
the
three
cottonwoods
yes
says
larry
where
you
get
into
the
canyon
oh
my
hoss
slipped
off
into
the
barranca
just
above
the
barranca
just
above
repeats
hahn
lookin
straight
at
him
larry
took
one
step
back
you
ought
to
be
almighty
glad
i
got
into
the
canyon
at
all
says
he
hahn
stepped
up
holdin
out
his
hand
that
right
says
he
you
done
us
a
good
turn
there
larry
took
his
hand
at
the
same
time
hahn
pulled
his
gun
and
shot
him
through
the
middle
it
was
all
so
sudden
and
unexpected
that
i
stood
there
paralysed
larry
fell
forward
the
way
a
man
mostly
will
when
he
hit
in
the
stomach
but
somehow
he
jerked
loose
a
gun
and
got
it
off
twice
he
did
hit
nothin
and
i
reckon
he
was
dead
before
he
hit
the
ground
and
there
he
had
my
gun
and
i
was
about
as
useless
as
a
pocket
in
a
shirt
no
sir
you
can
talk
as
much
as
you
please
but
the
killer
is
a
ornery
scub
and
he
do
hesitate
at
no
treachery
or
ingratitude
to
keep
his
carcass
safe
jed
parker
ceased
talking
the
dusk
had
fallen
in
the
little
room
and
dimly
could
be
seen
the
recumbent
figures
lying
at
ease
on
their
blankets
the
ranch
foreman
was
sitting
bolt
upright
a
faint
glow
from
his
pipe
barely
distinguished
his
features
what
became
of
the
rustlers
i
asked
him
well
sir
that
is
the
queer
part
hahn
himself
who
had
done
the
killin
skipped
out
we
got
out
warrants
of
course
but
they
never
got
served
he
was
a
sort
of
half
outlaw
from
that
time
and
was
killed
finally
in
the
train
of
but
the
others
we
tried
for
rustling
we
did
have
much
of
a
case
as
the
law
went
then
and
they
have
gone
free
if
the
woman
had
turned
evidence
against
them
the
killin
was
too
much
for
her
and
as
the
precedent
held
good
in
a
lot
of
other
rustlin
cases
larry
death
was
really
the
beginnin
of
law
and
order
in
the
cattle
business
we
smoked
the
last
light
suddenly
showed
red
against
the
grimy
window
windy
bill
arose
and
looked
out
the
door
boys
said
he
returning
she
cleared
off
we
can
get
back
to
the

chapter
five
the
drive
a
cry
awakened
me
it
was
still
deep
night
the
moon
sailed
overhead
the
stars
shone
unwavering
like
candles
and
a
chill
breeze
wandered
in
from
the
open
spaces
of
the
desert
i
raised
myself
on
my
elbow
throwing
aside
the
blankets
and
the
canvas
tarpaulin
forty
other
indistinct
formless
bundles
on
the
ground
all
about
me
were
sluggishly
astir
four
figures
passed
and
repassed
between
me
and
a
red
fire
i
knew
them
for
the
two
cooks
and
the
horse
wranglers
one
of
the
latter
was
grumbling
did
git
in
till
last
night
he
growled
might
as
well
trade
my
bed
for
a
lantern
and
be
done
with
it
even
as
i
stretched
my
arms
and
shivered
a
little
the
two
wranglers
threw
down
their
tin
plates
with
a
clatter
mounted
horses
and
rode
away
in
the
direction
of
the
thousand
acres
or
so
known
as
the
pasture
i
pulled
on
my
clothes
hastily
buckled
in
my
buckskin
shirt
and
dove
for
the
fire
a
dozen
others
were
before
me
it
was
bitterly
cold
in
the
east
the
sky
had
paled
the
least
bit
in
the
world
but
the
moon
and
stars
shone
on
bravely
and
undiminished
a
band
of
coyotes
was
shrieking
desperate
blasphemies
against
the
new
day
and
the
stray
herd
awakening
was
beginning
to
bawl
and
bellow
two
dutch
ovens
filled
with
pieces
of
fried
beef
stood
near
the
fire
two
galvanised
water
buckets
brimming
with
soda
biscuits
flanked
them
two
tremendous
coffee
pots
stood
guard
at
either
end
we
picked
us
each
a
tin
cup
and
a
tin
plate
from
the
box
at
the
rear
of
the
chuck
wagon
helped
ourselves
from
a
dutch
oven
a
pail
and
a
coffee
pot
and
squatted
on
our
heels
as
close
to
the
fire
as
possible
men
who
came
too
late
borrowed
the
shovel
scooped
up
some
coals
and
so
started
little
fires
of
their
own
about
which
new
groups
formed
while
we
ate
the
eastern
sky
lightened
the
mountains
under
the
dawn
looked
like
silhouettes
cut
from
paper
those
in
the
west
showed
faintly
luminous
objects
about
us
became
dimly
visible
we
could
make
out
the
windmill
and
the
adobe
of
the
ranch
houses
and
the
corrals
the
cowboys
arose
one
by
one
dropped
their
plates
into
the
dishpan
and
began
to
hunt
out
their
ropes
everything
was
obscure
and
mysterious
in
the
faint
grey
light
i
watched
windy
bill
near
his
tarpaulin
he
stooped
to
throw
over
the
canvas
when
he
bent
it
was
before
daylight
when
he
straightened
his
back
daylight
had
come
it
was
just
like
that
as
though
someone
had
reached
out
his
hand
to
turn
on
the
illumination
of
the
world
the
eastern
mountains
were
fragile
the
plain
was
ethereal
like
a
sea
of
liquid
gases
from
the
pasture
we
heard
the
shoutings
of
the
wranglers
and
made
out
a
cloud
of
dust
in
a
moment
the
first
of
the
remuda
came
into
view
trotting
forward
with
the
free
grace
of
the
unburdened
horse
others
followed
in
procession
those
near
sharp
and
well
defined
those
in
the
background
more
or
less
obscured
by
the
dust
now
appearing
plainly
now
fading
like
ghosts
the
leader
turned
unhesitatingly
into
the
corral
after
him
poured
the
stream
of
the
remuda
two
hundred
and
fifty
saddle
horses
with
an
unceasing
thunder
of
hoofs
immediately
the
was
deserted
the
cowboys
entered
the
corral
the
horses
began
to
circle
around
the
edge
of
the
enclosure
as
around
the
circumference
of
a
circus
ring
the
men
grouped
at
the
centre
watched
keenly
looking
for
the
mounts
they
had
already
decided
on
in
no
time
each
had
recognised
his
choice
and
his
loop
trailing
was
walking
toward
that
part
of
the
revolving
circumference
where
his
pony
dodged
some
few
whirled
the
loop
but
most
cast
it
with
a
quick
flip
it
was
really
marvellous
to
observe
the
accuracy
with
which
the
noose
would
fly
past
a
dozen
tossing
heads
and
over
a
dozen
backs
to
settle
firmly
about
the
neck
of
an
animal
perhaps
in
the
very
centre
of
the
group
but
again
if
the
first
throw
failed
it
was
interesting
to
see
how
the
selected
pony
would
dodge
double
back
twist
turn
and
hide
to
escape
second
cast
and
it
was
equally
interesting
to
observe
how
his
companions
would
help
him
they
seemed
to
realise
that
they
were
not
wanted
and
would
push
themselves
between
the
cowboy
and
his
intended
mount
with
the
utmost
boldness
in
the
thick
dust
that
instantly
arose
and
with
the
bewildering
thunder
of
galloping
the
flashing
change
of
grouping
the
rush
of
the
charging
animals
recognition
alone
would
seem
almost
impossible
yet
in
an
incredibly
short
time
each
had
his
mount
and
the
others
under
convoy
of
the
wranglers
were
meekly
wending
their
way
out
over
the
plain
there
until
time
for
a
change
of
horses
they
would
graze
in
a
loose
and
scattered
band
requiring
scarcely
any
supervision
escape
bless
you
no
that
thought
was
the
last
in
their
minds
in
the
meantime
the
saddles
and
bridles
were
adjusted
always
in
a
cowboy
string
of
from
six
to
ten
animals
the
boss
assigns
him
two
or
three
broncos
to
break
in
to
the
cow
business
therefore
each
morning
we
could
observe
a
half
dozen
or
so
men
gingerly
leading
wicked
looking
little
animals
out
to
the
sand
to
take
the
pitch
out
of
them
one
small
black
belonging
to
a
cowboy
called
the
judge
used
more
than
to
fulfil
expectations
of
a
good
time
go
to
him
judge
someone
would
always
remark
if
he
ai
goin
to
pitch
i
ai
goin
to
make
him
the
judge
would
grin
as
he
swung
aboard
the
black
would
trot
off
quite
calmly
and
in
a
most
matter
of
fact
way
as
though
to
shame
all
slanderers
of
his
character
then
as
the
bystanders
would
turn
away
he
would
utter
a
squeal
throw
down
his
head
and
go
at
it
he
was
a
very
hard
bucker
and
made
some
really
spectacular
jumps
but
the
trick
on
which
he
based
his
claims
to
originality
consisted
in
standing
on
his
hind
legs
at
so
perilous
an
approach
to
the
perpendicular
that
his
rider
would
conclude
he
was
about
to
fall
backwards
and
then
suddenly
springing
forward
in
a
series
of
bucks
the
first
manoeuvre
induced
the
rider
to
loosen
his
seat
in
order
to
be
ready
to
jump
from
under
and
the
second
threw
him
before
he
could
regain
his
grip
and
they
say
a
horse
do
think
exclaimed
an
admirer
but
as
these
were
broken
horses
save
the
mark
the
show
was
all
over
after
each
had
had
his
little
fling
we
mounted
and
rode
away
just
as
the
mountain
peaks
to
the
west
caught
the
rays
of
a
sun
we
should
not
enjoy
for
a
good
half
hour
yet
i
had
five
horses
in
my
string
and
this
morning
rode
that
c
s
horse
brown
jug
brown
jug
was
a
powerful
and
animal
about
fourteen
two
in
height
and
possessed
of
a
vast
enthusiasm
for
as
the
morning
was
frosty
he
felt
good
at
the
gate
of
the
water
corral
we
separated
into
two
groups
the
smaller
under
the
direction
of
jed
parker
was
to
drive
the
mesquite
in
the
wide
flats
the
rest
of
us
under
the
command
of
homer
the
captain
were
to
sweep
the
country
even
as
far
as
the
base
of
the
foothills
near
mount
graham
accordingly
we
put
our
horses
to
the
full
gallop
mile
after
mile
we
thundered
along
at
a
brisk
rate
of
speed
sometimes
we
dodged
in
and
out
among
the
mesquite
bushes
alternately
separating
and
coming
together
again
sometimes
we
swept
over
grassy
plains
apparently
of
illimitable
extent
sometimes
we
skipped
and
hopped
and
through
and
over
little
gullies
barrancas
and
other
sorts
of
malpais
but
always
without
drawing
rein
the
men
rode
easily
with
no
thought
to
the
way
nor
care
for
the
footing
the
air
came
back
sharp
against
our
faces
the
warm
blood
stirred
by
the
rush
flowed
more
rapidly
we
experienced
a
delightful
glow
of
the
morning
cold
only
the
very
tips
of
our
fingers
and
the
ends
of
our
noses
retained
a
remnant
already
the
sun
was
shining
low
and
level
across
the
plains
the
shadows
of
the
canons
modelled
the
hitherto
flat
surfaces
of
the
mountains
after
a
time
we
came
to
some
low
hills
helmeted
with
the
outcrop
of
a
rock
escarpment
hitherto
they
had
seemed
a
termination
of
mount
graham
but
now
when
we
rode
around
them
we
discovered
them
to
be
separated
from
the
range
by
a
good
five
miles
of
sloping
plain
later
we
looked
back
and
would
have
sworn
them
part
of
the
dos
cabesas
system
did
we
not
know
them
to
be
at
least
eight
miles
distant
from
that
rocky
rampart
it
is
always
that
way
in
arizona
spaces
develop
of
whose
existence
you
had
not
the
slightest
intimation
hidden
in
apparently
plane
surfaces
are
valleys
and
prairies
at
one
sweep
of
the
eye
you
embrace
the
entire
area
of
an
eastern
state
but
nevertheless
the
reality
as
you
explore
it
foot
by
foot
proves
to
be
infinitely
more
than
the
vision
has
promised
beyond
the
hill
we
stopped
here
our
party
divided
again
half
to
the
right
and
half
to
the
left
we
had
ridden
up
to
this
time
directly
away
from
camp
now
we
rode
a
circumference
of
which
headquarters
was
the
centre
the
country
was
pleasantly
rolling
and
covered
with
grass
here
and
there
were
clumps
of
soapweed
far
in
a
remote
distance
lay
a
slender
dark
line
across
the
plain
this
we
knew
to
be
mesquite
and
once
entered
we
knew
it
too
would
seem
to
spread
out
vastly
and
then
this
grassy
slope
on
which
we
now
rode
would
show
merely
as
an
insignificant
streak
of
yellow
it
is
also
like
that
in
arizona
i
have
ridden
in
succession
through
grass
land
brush
land
flower
land
desert
each
in
turn
seemed
entirely
to
fill
the
space
of
the
plains
between
the
mountains
from
time
to
time
homer
halted
us
and
detached
a
man
the
business
of
the
latter
was
then
to
ride
directly
back
to
camp
driving
all
cattle
before
him
each
was
in
sight
of
his
and
neighbour
thus
was
constructed
a
whose
meshes
contracted
as
home
was
neared
i
was
detached
when
of
our
party
only
the
cattleman
and
homer
remained
they
would
take
the
outside
this
was
the
post
of
honour
and
required
the
hardest
riding
for
as
soon
as
the
cattle
should
realise
the
fact
of
their
pursuit
they
would
attempt
to
break
past
the
end
and
up
the
valley
brown
jug
and
i
congratulated
ourselves
on
an
exciting
morning
in
prospect
now
wild
cattle
know
perfectly
well
what
a
drive
means
and
they
do
not
intend
to
get
into
a
if
they
can
help
it
were
it
not
for
the
two
facts
that
they
are
afraid
of
a
mounted
man
and
can
not
run
quite
so
fast
as
a
horse
i
do
not
know
how
the
cattle
business
would
be
conducted
as
soon
as
a
band
of
them
caught
sight
of
any
one
of
us
they
curled
their
tails
and
away
they
went
at
a
long
easy
lope
that
a
domestic
cow
would
stare
at
in
wonder
this
was
all
very
well
in
fact
we
yelled
and
shrieked
and
otherwise
uttered
to
keep
them
going
to
get
the
cattle
started
as
they
say
but
pretty
soon
a
little
band
of
the
many
scurrying
away
before
our
thin
line
began
to
bear
farther
and
farther
to
the
east
when
in
their
judgment
they
should
have
gained
an
opening
they
would
turn
directly
back
and
make
a
dash
for
liberty
accordingly
the
nearest
cowboy
clapped
spurs
to
his
horse
and
pursued
them
it
was
a
pretty
race
the
cattle
ran
easily
enough
with
long
springy
jumps
that
carried
them
over
the
ground
faster
than
appearances
would
lead
one
to
believe
the
his
nose
stretched
out
his
ears
slanted
his
eyes
snapping
with
joy
of
the
chase
flew
fairly
belly
to
earth
the
rider
sat
slightly
forward
with
the
cowboy
loose
seat
a
whirl
of
dust
strangely
insignificant
against
the
immensity
of
a
desert
morning
rose
from
the
flying
group
now
they
disappeared
in
a
ravine
only
to
scramble
out
again
the
next
instant
pace
undiminished
the
rider
merely
rose
slightly
and
threw
up
his
elbows
to
relieve
the
jar
of
the
rough
gully
at
first
the
cattle
seemed
to
hold
their
own
but
soon
the
horse
began
to
gain
in
a
short
time
he
had
come
abreast
of
the
leading
animal
the
latter
stopped
short
with
a
snort
dodged
back
and
set
out
at
right
angles
to
his
former
course
from
a
dead
run
the
pony
came
to
a
stand
in
two
fierce
plunges
doubled
like
a
shot
and
was
off
on
the
other
tack
an
unaccustomed
rider
would
here
have
lost
his
seat
the
second
dash
was
short
with
a
final
shake
of
the
head
the
steers
turned
to
the
proper
course
in
the
direction
of
the
ranch
the
pony
dropped
unconcernedly
to
the
shuffling
jog
of
habitual
progression
far
away
stretched
the
arc
of
our
cordon
the
most
distant
rider
was
a
speck
and
the
cattle
ahead
of
him
were
like
maggots
endowed
with
a
smooth
swift
onward
motion
as
yet
the
herd
had
not
taken
form
it
was
still
too
widely
scattered
its
units
in
the
shape
of
small
bunches
momently
grew
in
numbers
the
distant
plains
were
crawling
and
alive
with
minute
creatures
making
toward
a
common
tiny
centre
immediately
in
our
front
the
cattle
at
first
behaved
very
well
then
far
down
the
long
gentle
slope
i
saw
a
break
for
the
upper
valley
the
manikin
that
represented
homer
at
once
became
even
smaller
as
it
departed
in
pursuit
the
cattleman
moved
down
to
cover
territory
until
he
should
return
and
i
in
turn
edged
farther
to
the
right
then
another
break
from
another
bunch
the
cattleman
rode
at
top
speed
to
head
it
before
long
he
disappeared
in
the
distant
mesquite
i
found
myself
in
sole
charge
of
a
front
three
miles
long
the
nearest
cattle
were
some
distance
ahead
and
trotting
along
at
a
good
gait
as
they
had
not
yet
discovered
the
chance
left
open
by
unforeseen
circumstance
i
descended
and
took
in
on
my
cinch
while
yet
there
was
time
even
as
i
mounted
an
impatient
movement
on
the
part
of
experienced
brown
jug
told
me
that
the
cattle
had
seen
their
opportunity
i
gathered
the
reins
and
spoke
to
the
horse
he
needed
no
further
direction
but
set
off
at
a
wide
angle
nicely
calculated
to
intercept
the
truants
brown
jug
was
a
powerful
beast
the
spring
of
his
leap
was
as
whalebone
the
yellow
earth
began
to
stream
past
like
water
always
the
pace
increased
with
a
growing
thunder
of
hoofs
it
seemed
that
nothing
could
turn
us
from
the
straight
line
nothing
check
the
headlong
momentum
of
our
rush
my
eyes
filled
with
tears
from
the
wind
of
our
going
saddle
strings
streamed
behind
brown
jug
mane
whipped
my
bridle
band
dimly
i
was
conscious
of
soapweed
sacatone
mesquite
as
we
passed
them
they
were
abreast
and
gone
before
i
could
think
of
them
or
how
they
were
to
be
dodged
two
antelope
bounded
away
to
the
left
birds
rose
hastily
from
the
grasses
a
sudden
chirk
chirk
chirk
rose
all
about
me
we
were
in
the
very
centre
of
a
town
but
before
i
could
formulate
in
my
mind
the
probabilities
of
holes
and
broken
legs
the
chirk
chirk
chirking
had
fallen
astern
brown
jug
had
skipped
and
dodged
successfully
we
were
approaching
the
cattle
they
ran
stubbornly
and
well
evidently
unwilling
to
be
turned
until
the
latest
possible
moment
a
great
rage
at
their
obstinacy
took
possession
of
us
both
a
broad
shallow
wash
crossed
our
way
but
we
plunged
through
its
rocks
and
boulders
recklessly
angered
at
even
the
slight
delay
they
necessitated
the
hardland
on
the
other
side
we
greeted
with
joy
brown
jug
extended
himself
with
a
snort
suddenly
a
jar
seemed
to
shake
my
very
head
loose
i
found
myself
staring
over
the
horse
head
directly
down
into
a
deep
and
precipitous
gully
the
edge
of
which
was
so
cunningly
concealed
by
the
grasses
as
to
have
remained
invisible
to
my
blurred
vision
brown
jug
however
had
caught
sight
of
it
at
the
last
instant
and
had
executed
one
of
the
wonderful
stops
possible
only
to
a
but
already
the
cattle
had
discovered
a
passage
above
and
were
scrambling
down
and
across
brown
jug
and
i
at
more
sober
pace
slid
off
the
almost
perpendicular
bank
and
out
the
other
side
a
moment
later
we
had
headed
them
they
whirled
and
without
the
necessity
of
any
suggestion
on
my
part
brown
jug
turned
after
them
and
so
quickly
that
my
stirrup
actually
brushed
the
ground
after
that
we
were
masters
we
chased
the
cattle
far
enough
to
start
them
well
in
the
proper
direction
and
then
pulled
down
to
a
walk
in
order
to
get
a
breath
of
air
but
now
we
noticed
another
band
back
on
the
ground
over
which
we
had
just
come
doubling
through
in
the
direction
of
mount
graham
a
hard
run
set
them
to
rights
we
turned
more
had
poured
out
from
the
hills
bands
were
crossing
everywhere
ahead
and
behind
brown
jug
and
i
went
to
work
being
an
indivisible
unit
we
could
chase
only
one
bunch
at
a
time
and
while
we
were
after
one
a
half
dozen
others
would
be
taking
advantage
of
our
preoccupation
we
could
not
hold
our
own
each
run
after
an
escaping
bunch
had
to
be
on
a
longer
diagonal
gradually
we
were
forced
back
and
back
and
back
but
still
we
managed
to
hold
the
line
unbroken
never
shall
i
forget
the
dash
and
clatter
of
that
morning
neither
brown
jug
nor
i
thought
for
a
moment
of
sparing
horseflesh
nor
of
picking
a
route
we
made
the
shortest
line
and
paid
little
attention
to
anything
that
stood
in
the
way
a
very
fever
of
resistance
possessed
us
it
was
like
beating
against
a
head
wind
or
fighting
fire
or
combating
in
any
other
of
the
great
forces
of
nature
we
were
quite
alone
the
cattleman
and
homer
had
vanished
to
our
left
the
men
were
fully
occupied
in
marshalling
the
compact
brown
herds
that
had
gradually
massed
for
these
antagonists
of
mine
were
merely
outlying
remnants
i
suppose
brown
jug
must
have
run
nearly
twenty
miles
with
only
one
check
then
we
chased
a
cow
some
distance
and
into
the
dry
bed
of
a
stream
where
she
whirled
on
us
savagely
by
luck
her
horn
hit
only
the
leather
of
my
saddle
skirts
so
we
left
her
for
when
a
cow
has
sense
enough
to
get
on
the
peck
there
is
no
driving
her
farther
we
gained
nothing
and
had
to
give
ground
but
we
succeeded
in
holding
a
semblance
of
order
so
that
the
cattle
did
not
break
and
scatter
far
and
wide
the
sun
had
by
now
well
risen
and
was
beginning
to
shine
hot
brown
jug
still
ran
gamely
and
displayed
as
much
interest
as
ever
but
he
was
evidently
tiring
we
were
both
glad
to
see
grey
showing
in
the
fringe
of
mesquite
together
we
soon
succeeded
in
throwing
the
cows
into
the
main
herd
and
strangely
enough
as
soon
as
they
had
joined
a
compact
band
of
their
fellows
their
wildness
left
them
and
convoyed
by
outsiders
they
set
themselves
to
plodding
energetically
toward
the
home
ranch
as
my
horse
was
somewhat
winded
i
joined
the
drag
at
the
rear
here
by
course
of
natural
sifting
soon
accumulated
all
the
lazy
gentle
and
sickly
cows
and
the
small
calves
the
difficulty
now
was
to
prevent
them
from
lagging
and
dropping
out
to
that
end
we
indulged
in
a
great
variety
of
the
picturesque
peculiar
to
the
cowboy
one
found
an
old
tin
can
which
by
the
aid
of
a
few
pebbles
he
converted
into
a
very
effective
rattle
the
dust
rose
in
clouds
and
eddied
in
the
sun
we
slouched
easily
in
our
saddles
the
cowboys
compared
notes
as
to
the
brands
they
had
seen
our
ponies
shuffled
along
resting
but
always
ready
for
a
dash
in
chase
of
an
occasional
bull
calf
or
yearling
with
independent
ideas
of
its
own
thus
we
passed
over
the
country
down
the
long
gentle
slope
to
the
sink
of
the
valley
whence
another
long
gentle
slope
ran
to
the
base
of
the
other
ranges
at
greater
or
lesser
distances
we
caught
the
dust
and
made
out
dimly
the
masses
of
the
other
herds
collected
by
our
companions
and
by
the
party
under
jed
parker
they
went
forward
toward
the
common
centre
with
a
slow
ruminative
movement
and
the
dust
they
raised
went
with
them
little
by
little
they
grew
plainer
to
us
and
the
home
ranch
hitherto
merely
a
brown
shimmer
in
the
distance
began
to
take
on
definition
as
the
group
of
buildings
windmills
and
corrals
we
knew
miniature
horsemen
could
be
seen
galloping
forward
to
the
open
white
plain
where
the
herd
would
be
held
then
the
mesquite
enveloped
us
and
we
knew
little
more
save
the
anxiety
lest
we
overlook
laggards
in
the
brush
until
we
came
out
on
the
edge
of
that
same
white
plain
here
were
more
cattle
thousands
of
them
and
billows
of
dust
and
a
great
bellowing
and
slim
mounted
figures
riding
and
shouting
ahead
of
the
herd
soon
they
succeeded
in
turning
the
leaders
back
these
threw
into
confusion
those
that
followed
in
a
few
moments
the
cattle
had
stopped
a
cordon
of
horsemen
sat
at
equal
distances
holding
them
in
pretty
good
haul
said
the
man
next
to
me
a
good
five
thousand
head
chapter
six
cutting
out
it
was
somewhere
near
noon
by
the
time
we
had
bunched
and
held
the
herd
of
some
four
or
five
thousand
head
in
the
smooth
wide
flat
free
from
bushes
and
dog
holes
each
sat
at
ease
on
his
horse
facing
the
cattle
watching
lazily
the
clouds
of
dust
and
the
shifting
beasts
but
ready
at
any
instant
to
turn
back
the
restless
or
independent
individuals
that
might
break
for
liberty
out
of
the
haze
came
homer
the
captain
on
an
easy
lope
as
he
passed
successively
the
sentries
he
delivered
to
each
a
low
command
but
without
slacking
pace
some
of
those
spoken
to
wheeled
their
horses
and
rode
away
the
others
settled
themselves
in
their
saddles
and
began
to
roll
cigarettes
change
horses
get
something
to
eat
said
he
to
me
so
i
swung
after
the
file
traveling
at
a
canter
over
the
low
swells
beyond
the
plain
the
remuda
had
been
driven
by
its
leaders
to
a
corner
of
the
wire
fence
and
there
held
as
each
man
arrived
he
dismounted
threw
off
his
saddle
and
turned
his
animal
loose
then
he
flipped
a
loop
in
his
rope
and
disappeared
in
the
eddying
herd
the
discarded
horse
with
many
grunts
indulged
in
a
satisfying
roll
shook
himself
vigorously
and
walked
slowly
away
his
labour
was
over
for
the
day
and
he
knew
it
and
took
not
the
slightest
trouble
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
the
men
with
the
swinging
ropes
not
so
the
fresh
horses
however
they
had
no
intention
of
being
caught
if
they
could
help
it
but
dodged
and
twisted
hid
and
doubled
behind
the
moving
screen
of
their
friends
the
latter
seeming
as
usual
to
know
they
were
not
wanted
made
no
effort
to
avoid
the
men
which
probably
accounted
in
great
measure
for
the
fact
that
the
herd
as
a
body
remained
compact
in
spite
of
the
cowboys
threading
it
and
in
spite
of
the
lack
of
an
enclosure
our
horses
caught
we
saddled
as
hastily
as
possible
and
then
at
the
top
speed
of
our
fresh
and
eager
ponies
we
swept
down
on
the
chuck
wagon
there
we
fell
off
our
saddles
and
descended
on
the
meat
and
bread
like
ravenous
locusts
on
a
cornfield
the
ponies
stood
where
we
left
them
tied
to
the
ground
the
fashion
as
soon
as
a
man
had
stoked
up
for
the
afternoon
he
rode
away
some
finished
before
others
so
across
the
plain
formed
an
endless
procession
of
men
returning
to
the
herd
and
of
those
whom
they
replaced
coming
for
their
turn
at
the
grub
we
found
the
herd
quiet
some
were
even
lying
down
chewing
their
cuds
as
peacefully
as
any
barnyard
cows
most
however
stood
ruminative
or
walked
slowly
to
and
fro
in
the
confines
allotted
by
the
horsemen
so
that
the
herd
looked
from
a
distance
like
a
brown
carpet
whose
pattern
was
constantly
changing
a
dusty
brown
carpet
in
the
process
of
being
beaten
i
relieved
one
of
the
watchers
and
settled
myself
for
a
wait
at
this
close
inspection
the
different
sorts
of
cattle
showed
more
distinctly
their
characteristics
the
cows
and
calves
generally
rested
peacefully
enough
the
calf
often
lying
down
while
the
mother
stood
guard
over
it
steers
however
were
more
restless
they
walked
ceaselessly
threading
their
way
in
and
out
among
the
standing
cattle
pausing
in
brutish
amazement
at
the
edge
of
the
herd
and
turning
back
immediately
to
endless
journeyings
the
bulls
excited
by
so
much
company
forced
on
their
accustomed
solitary
habit
roared
defiance
at
each
other
until
the
air
fairly
trembled
occasionally
two
would
clash
foreheads
then
the
powerful
animals
would
push
and
wrestle
trying
for
a
chance
to
gore
the
decision
of
supremacy
was
a
question
of
but
a
few
minutes
and
a
bloody
topknot
the
worst
damage
the
defeated
one
hastily
and
clumsily
out
of
reach
and
then
walked
away
most
of
the
time
all
we
had
to
do
was
to
sit
our
horses
and
watch
these
things
to
enjoy
the
warm
bath
of
the
arizona
sun
and
to
converse
with
our
next
neighbours
once
in
a
while
some
enterprising
cow
observing
the
opening
between
the
men
would
start
to
walk
out
others
would
fall
in
behind
her
until
the
movement
would
become
general
then
one
of
us
would
swing
his
leg
off
the
pommel
and
jog
his
pony
over
to
head
them
off
they
would
return
peacefully
enough
but
one
black
muley
cow
with
a
calf
as
black
and
muley
as
herself
was
more
persistent
time
after
time
with
infinite
patience
she
tried
it
again
the
moment
my
back
was
turned
i
tried
driving
her
far
into
the
herd
no
use
she
always
returned
quirtings
and
stones
had
no
effect
on
her
mild
and
steady
persistence
she
a
san
simon
cow
drawled
my
neighbour
everybody
knows
her
she
at
every
just
naturally
raisin
hell
when
the
last
man
had
returned
from
chuck
homer
made
the
dispositions
for
the
cut
there
were
present
probably
thirty
men
from
the
home
ranches
round
about
and
twenty
representing
owners
at
a
distance
here
to
pick
up
the
strays
inevitable
to
the
season
drift
the
captain
appointed
two
men
to
hold
the
cut
and
two
more
to
hold
the
steer
cut
several
of
us
rode
into
the
herd
while
the
remainder
retained
their
positions
as
sentinels
to
hold
the
main
body
of
cattle
in
shape
little
g
and
i
rode
slowly
among
the
cattle
looking
everywhere
the
animals
moved
sluggishly
aside
to
give
us
passage
and
closed
in
as
sluggishly
behind
us
so
that
we
were
always
closely
hemmed
in
wherever
we
went
over
the
shifting
sleek
backs
through
the
eddying
clouds
of
dust
i
could
make
out
the
figures
of
my
companions
moving
slowly
apparently
aimlessly
here
and
there
our
task
for
the
moment
was
to
search
out
the
unbranded
j
h
calves
since
in
ranks
so
closely
crowded
it
would
be
physically
impossible
actually
to
see
an
animal
branded
flank
we
depended
entirely
on
the
did
you
ever
notice
how
any
animal
tame
or
wild
always
points
his
ears
inquiringly
in
the
direction
of
whatever
interests
or
alarms
him
those
ears
are
for
the
moment
his
most
prominent
feature
so
when
a
brand
is
quite
indistinguishable
because
as
now
of
press
of
numbers
or
as
in
winter
from
extreme
length
of
hair
the
cropped
ears
tell
plainly
the
tale
of
ownership
as
every
animal
is
so
marked
when
branded
it
follows
that
an
uncut
pair
of
ears
means
that
its
owner
has
never
felt
the
iron
so
now
we
had
to
look
first
of
all
for
calves
with
uncut
ears
after
discovering
one
we
had
to
ascertain
his
ownership
by
examining
the
of
his
mother
by
whose
side
he
was
sure
in
this
alarming
multitude
to
be
clinging
faithfully
calves
were
numerous
and
j
h
cows
everywhere
to
be
seen
so
in
somewhat
less
than
ten
seconds
i
had
my
eye
on
a
mother
and
son
immediately
i
turned
little
g
in
their
direction
at
the
slap
of
my
quirt
against
the
stirrup
all
the
cows
immediately
about
me
shrank
suspiciously
aside
little
g
stepped
forward
daintily
his
nostrils
expanding
his
ears
working
back
and
forth
trying
to
the
best
of
his
ability
to
understand
which
animals
i
had
selected
the
cow
and
her
calf
turned
in
toward
the
centre
of
the
herd
a
touch
of
the
reins
guided
the
pony
at
once
he
comprehended
from
that
time
on
he
needed
no
further
directions
cautiously
patiently
with
great
skill
he
forced
the
cow
through
the
press
toward
the
edge
of
the
herd
it
had
to
be
done
very
quietly
at
a
foot
pace
so
as
to
alarm
neither
the
objects
of
pursuit
nor
those
surrounding
them
when
the
cow
turned
back
little
g
somehow
happened
always
in
her
way
before
she
knew
it
she
was
at
the
outer
edge
of
the
herd
there
she
found
herself
with
a
group
of
three
or
four
companions
facing
the
open
plain
instinctively
she
sought
shelter
i
felt
little
g
muscles
tighten
beneath
me
the
moment
for
action
had
come
before
the
cow
had
a
chance
to
dodge
among
her
companions
the
pony
was
upon
her
like
a
thunderbolt
she
broke
in
alarm
trying
desperately
to
avoid
the
rush
there
ensued
an
exciting
contest
of
dodgings
turnings
and
doublings
wherever
she
turned
little
g
was
before
her
some
of
his
evolutions
were
marvellous
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
sit
my
saddle
and
apply
just
that
final
touch
of
judgment
denied
even
the
wisest
of
the
lower
animals
time
and
again
the
turn
was
so
quick
that
the
stirrup
swept
the
ground
at
last
the
cow
convinced
of
the
uselessness
of
further
effort
to
return
broke
away
on
a
long
lumbering
run
to
the
open
plain
she
was
stopped
and
held
by
the
men
detailed
and
so
formed
the
nucleus
of
the
new
immediately
little
g
his
ears
working
in
conscious
virtue
back
into
the
herd
ready
for
another
after
a
dozen
cows
had
been
sent
across
to
the
the
work
simplified
once
a
cow
caught
sight
of
this
new
band
she
generally
made
directly
for
it
head
and
tail
up
after
the
first
short
struggle
to
force
her
from
the
herd
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
start
her
in
the
proper
direction
and
keep
her
at
it
until
her
decision
was
fixed
if
she
was
too
soon
left
to
her
own
devices
however
she
was
likely
to
return
an
old
cowman
knows
to
a
second
just
the
proper
moment
to
abandon
her
sometimes
in
spite
of
our
best
efforts
a
cow
succeeded
in
circling
us
and
plunging
into
the
main
herd
the
temptation
was
then
strong
to
plunge
in
also
and
to
drive
her
out
by
main
force
but
the
temptation
had
to
be
resisted
a
dash
into
the
thick
of
it
might
break
the
whole
band
at
once
of
his
own
accord
little
g
dropped
to
his
fast
shuffling
walk
and
again
we
addressed
ourselves
to
the
task
of
pushing
her
gently
to
the
edge
this
was
all
comparatively
simple
almost
any
pony
is
fast
enough
for
the
calf
cut
but
now
homer
gave
orders
for
the
steer
cut
to
begin
and
steers
are
rapid
and
resourceful
and
full
of
natural
cussedness
little
g
and
i
were
relieved
by
windy
bill
and
betook
ourselves
to
the
outside
of
the
herd
here
we
had
leisure
to
observe
the
effects
that
up
to
this
moment
we
had
ourselves
been
producing
the
herd
restless
by
reason
of
the
horsemen
threading
it
shifted
gave
ground
expanded
and
contracted
so
that
its
shape
and
size
were
always
changing
in
the
constant
area
guarded
by
the
sentinel
cowboys
dust
arose
from
these
movements
clouds
of
it
to
eddy
and
swirl
thicken
and
dissipate
in
the
currents
of
air
now
it
concealed
all
but
the
nearest
animals
again
it
parted
in
rifts
through
which
mistily
we
discerned
the
riders
moving
in
and
out
of
the
fog
again
it
lifted
high
and
thin
so
that
we
saw
in
clarity
the
whole
herd
and
the
outriders
and
the
mesas
far
away
as
the
afternoon
waned
long
shafts
of
sun
slanted
through
this
dust
it
played
on
men
and
beasts
magically
expanding
them
to
the
dimensions
of
strange
genii
appearing
and
effacing
themselves
in
the
billows
of
vapour
from
some
enchanted
bottle
we
on
the
outside
found
our
sinecure
of
hot
filched
from
us
by
the
cooler
hours
the
cattle
wearied
of
standing
and
perhaps
somewhat
hungry
and
thirsty
grew
more
and
more
impatient
we
rode
continually
back
and
forth
turning
the
slow
movement
in
on
itself
occasionally
some
particularly
enterprising
cow
would
conclude
that
one
or
another
of
the
would
suit
her
better
than
this
mill
of
turmoil
she
would
start
confidently
out
head
and
tail
up
find
herself
chased
back
get
stubborn
on
the
question
and
lead
her
pursuer
a
long
hard
run
before
she
would
return
to
her
companions
once
in
a
while
one
would
even
have
to
be
roped
and
dragged
back
for
know
before
something
happens
to
you
that
you
can
chase
a
cow
safely
only
until
she
gets
hot
and
winded
then
she
stands
her
ground
and
gets
emphatically
on
the
peck
i
remember
very
well
when
i
first
discovered
this
it
was
after
i
had
had
considerable
cow
work
too
i
thought
of
cows
as
i
had
always
seen
them
afraid
of
a
horseman
easy
to
turn
with
the
pony
and
willing
to
be
chased
as
far
as
necessary
to
the
work
nobody
told
me
anything
different
one
day
we
were
making
a
drive
in
an
exceedingly
broken
country
i
was
bringing
in
a
small
bunch
i
had
discovered
in
a
pocket
of
the
hills
but
was
excessively
annoyed
by
one
old
cow
that
insisted
on
breaking
back
in
the
wisdom
of
further
experience
i
now
conclude
that
she
probably
had
a
calf
in
the
brush
finally
she
got
away
entirely
after
starting
the
bunch
well
ahead
i
went
after
her
well
the
cow
and
i
ran
nearly
side
by
side
for
as
much
as
half
a
mile
at
top
speed
she
declined
to
be
headed
finally
she
fell
down
and
was
so
entirely
winded
that
she
could
not
get
up
now
old
girl
i
got
you
said
i
and
set
myself
to
urging
her
to
her
feet
the
pony
acted
somewhat
astonished
and
suspicious
of
the
job
therein
he
knew
a
lot
more
than
i
did
but
i
insisted
and
like
a
good
pony
he
obeyed
i
yelled
at
the
cow
and
slapped
my
bat
and
used
my
quirt
when
she
had
quite
recovered
her
wind
she
got
slowly
to
her
feet
and
charged
me
in
a
most
determined
manner
now
a
bull
or
a
steer
is
not
difficult
to
dodge
he
lowers
his
head
shuts
his
eyes
and
comes
in
on
one
straight
rush
but
a
cow
looks
to
see
what
she
is
doing
her
eyes
are
open
every
minute
and
it
overjoys
her
to
take
a
side
hook
at
you
even
when
you
succeed
in
eluding
her
direct
charge
the
pony
i
was
riding
did
his
best
but
even
then
could
not
avoid
a
sharp
prod
that
would
have
ripped
him
up
had
not
my
leather
bastos
intervened
then
we
retired
to
a
distance
in
order
to
plan
further
but
we
did
not
succeed
in
inducing
that
cow
to
revise
her
ideas
so
at
last
we
left
her
when
in
some
chagrin
i
mentioned
to
the
captain
the
fact
that
i
had
skipped
one
animal
he
merely
laughed
why
kid
said
he
you
ca
do
nothin
with
a
cow
that
gets
on
the
prod
that
away
you
ropes
her
and
what
could
you
do
with
her
out
there
if
you
did
rope
her
so
i
learned
one
thing
more
about
cows
after
the
steer
cut
had
been
finished
the
men
representing
the
neighbouring
ranges
looked
through
the
herd
for
strays
of
their
brands
these
were
thrown
into
the
which
had
been
brought
up
from
the
bottom
lands
to
receive
the
new
accessions
work
was
pushed
rapidly
as
the
afternoon
was
nearly
gone
in
fact
so
absorbed
were
we
that
until
it
was
almost
upon
us
we
did
not
notice
a
heavy
that
arose
in
the
region
of
the
dragoon
mountains
and
swept
rapidly
across
the
zenith
before
we
knew
it
the
rain
had
begun
in
ten
seconds
it
had
increased
to
a
deluge
and
in
twenty
we
were
all
to
leeward
of
the
herd
striving
desperately
to
stop
the
drift
of
the
cattle
down
wind
we
did
everything
in
our
power
to
stop
them
but
in
vain
slickers
waved
quirts
slapped
against
leather
flashed
but
still
the
cattle
heads
lowered
advanced
with
slow
and
sullen
persistence
that
would
not
be
stemmed
if
we
held
our
ground
they
divided
around
us
step
by
step
we
were
forced
to
give
way
the
thin
line
of
nervously
plunging
horses
sprayed
before
the
dense
mass
of
the
cattle
no
they
wo
stampede
shouted
charley
to
my
question
cows
and
calves
in
them
if
they
was
just
steers
or
grown
critters
they
might
the
sensations
of
those
few
moments
were
very
vivid
the
blinding
beat
of
the
storm
in
my
face
the
unbroken
front
of
horned
heads
bearing
down
on
me
resistless
as
fate
the
long
slant
of
rain
with
the
sun
shining
in
the
distance
beyond
it
abruptly
the
downpour
ceased
we
shook
our
hats
free
of
water
and
drove
the
herd
back
to
the
cutting
grounds
again
but
now
the
surface
of
the
ground
was
slippery
and
the
rapid
manoeuvring
of
horses
had
become
a
matter
precarious
in
the
extreme
time
and
again
the
ponies
fairly
sat
on
their
haunches
and
slid
when
negotiating
a
sudden
stop
while
quick
turns
meant
the
rapid
scramblings
that
only
a
could
accomplish
nevertheless
the
work
went
forward
unchecked
the
men
of
the
other
outfits
cut
their
cattle
into
the
the
latter
was
by
now
of
considerable
size
for
this
was
the
third
week
of
the
finally
everyone
expressed
himself
as
satisfied
the
largely
diminished
main
herd
was
now
started
forward
by
means
of
shrill
cowboy
cries
and
beating
of
quirts
the
cattle
were
only
too
eager
to
go
from
my
position
on
a
little
rise
above
the
i
could
see
the
leaders
breaking
into
a
run
their
heads
thrown
forward
as
they
snuffed
their
freedom
on
the
mesa
side
the
sentinel
riders
quietly
withdrew
from
the
rear
and
flanks
the
horsemen
closed
in
the
cattle
poured
out
in
a
steady
stream
through
the
opening
thus
left
on
the
mesa
side
the
fringe
of
cowboys
followed
urging
them
on
abruptly
the
cavalcade
turned
and
came
loping
back
the
cattle
continued
ahead
on
a
trot
gradually
spreading
abroad
over
the
landscape
losing
their
integrity
as
a
herd
some
of
the
slower
or
hungrier
dropped
out
and
began
to
graze
certain
of
the
more
wary
disappeared
to
right
or
left
now
after
the
day
work
was
practically
over
we
had
our
first
accident
the
horse
ridden
by
a
young
fellow
from
dos
cabesas
slipped
fell
and
rolled
quite
over
his
rider
at
once
the
animal
lunged
to
his
feet
only
to
be
immediately
seized
by
the
nearest
rider
but
the
dos
cabesas
man
lay
still
his
arms
and
legs
spread
abroad
his
head
doubled
sideways
in
a
horribly
suggestive
manner
we
hopped
off
two
men
straightened
him
out
while
two
more
looked
carefully
over
the
indications
on
the
ground
all
right
sang
out
one
of
them
the
horn
did
catch
him
he
pointed
to
the
indentation
left
by
the
pommel
indeed
five
minutes
brought
the
man
to
his
senses
he
complained
of
a
very
twisted
back
homer
set
one
of
the
men
in
after
the
by
means
of
which
the
sufferer
was
shortly
transported
to
camp
by
the
end
of
the
week
he
was
again
in
the
saddle
how
men
escape
from
this
common
accident
with
injuries
so
slight
has
always
puzzled
me
the
horse
rolls
completely
over
his
rider
and
yet
it
seems
to
be
the
rarest
thing
in
the
world
for
the
latter
to
be
either
killed
or
permanently
injured
now
each
man
had
the
privilege
of
looking
through
the
j
h
cuts
to
see
if
by
chance
steers
of
his
own
had
been
included
in
them
when
all
had
expressed
themselves
as
satisfied
the
various
bands
were
started
to
the
corrals
from
a
slight
eminence
where
i
had
paused
to
enjoy
the
evening
i
looked
down
on
the
scene
the
three
herds
separated
by
generous
distance
one
from
the
other
crawled
leisurely
along
the
riders
their
hats
thrust
back
lolled
in
their
saddles
shouting
conversation
to
each
other
relaxing
after
the
day
work
through
the
clouds
strong
shafts
of
light
belittled
the
living
creatures
threw
into
proportion
the
vastness
of
the
desert
chapter
seven
a
corner
in
horses
it
was
dark
night
the
bellowed
frantically
from
one
of
the
big
corrals
the
from
a
second
already
the
remuda
driven
in
from
the
open
plains
scattered
about
the
thousand
acres
of
pasture
away
from
the
conveniences
of
fence
and
corral
men
would
have
had
to
patrol
all
night
now
however
everyone
was
gathered
about
the
camp
fire
probably
forty
cowboys
were
in
the
group
representing
all
types
from
old
john
who
had
been
in
the
business
forty
years
and
had
punched
from
the
rio
grande
to
the
pacific
to
the
kid
who
would
have
given
his
chance
of
salvation
if
he
could
have
been
taken
for
ten
years
older
than
he
was
at
the
moment
jed
parker
was
holding
forth
to
his
friend
johnny
stone
in
reference
to
another
old
crony
who
had
that
evening
joined
the
johnny
inquired
jed
with
elaborate
gravity
and
entirely
ignoring
the
presence
of
the
subject
of
conversation
what
is
that
thing
just
beyond
the
fire
and
where
did
it
come
from
johnny
stone
squinted
to
make
sure
that
he
replied
oh
this
evenin
the
dogs
see
something
run
down
a
hole
and
they
dug
it
out
and
that
what
they
got
the
newcomer
grinned
the
trouble
with
you
fellows
he
proffered
is
that
you
so
plumb
alkalied
you
do
know
the
real
thing
when
you
see
it
that
right
supplemented
windy
bill
drily
he
come
from
new
york
no
cried
jed
you
do
say
so
did
he
come
in
one
box
or
in
two
under
cover
of
the
laugh
the
newcomer
made
a
raid
on
the
dutch
ovens
and
pails
having
filled
his
plate
he
squatted
on
his
heels
and
fell
to
his
belated
meal
he
was
a
tall
individual
with
a
lean
leathery
face
a
sweeping
white
moustache
and
a
grave
and
sardonic
eye
his
leather
chaps
were
plain
and
worn
and
his
hat
had
been
fashioned
by
time
and
wear
into
much
individuality
i
was
not
surprised
to
hear
him
nicknamed
sacatone
bill
just
ask
him
how
he
got
that
game
foot
suggested
johnny
stone
to
me
in
an
undertone
so
of
course
i
did
not
later
someone
told
me
that
the
lameness
resulted
from
his
refusal
of
an
urgent
invitation
to
return
across
a
river
sacatone
bill
happened
not
to
be
riding
his
own
horse
at
the
time
the
cattleman
dropped
down
beside
me
a
moment
later
i
wish
said
he
in
a
low
voice
we
could
get
that
fellow
talking
he
is
a
queer
one
pretty
well
educated
apparently
claims
to
be
writing
a
book
of
memoirs
sometimes
he
will
open
up
in
good
shape
and
sometimes
he
will
not
it
does
no
good
to
ask
him
direct
and
he
is
as
shy
as
an
old
crow
when
you
try
to
lead
him
up
to
a
subject
we
must
just
lie
low
and
trust
to
providence
a
man
was
playing
on
the
mouth
organ
he
played
excellently
well
with
all
sorts
of
variations
and
frills
we
smoked
in
silence
the
deep
rumble
of
the
cattle
filled
the
air
with
its
diapason
always
the
shrill
coyotes
raved
out
in
the
mesquite
sacatone
bill
had
finished
his
meal
and
had
gone
to
sit
by
jed
parker
his
old
friend
they
talked
together
the
evening
grew
and
the
eastern
sky
silvered
over
the
mountains
in
anticipation
of
the
moon
sacatone
bill
suddenly
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
reminds
me
of
the
time
i
went
to
colorado
he
cried
he
off
whispered
the
cattleman
a
dead
silence
fell
on
the
circle
everybody
shifted
position
the
better
to
listen
to
the
story
of
sacatone
bill
about
ten
year
ago
i
got
plumb
sick
of
punchin
cows
around
my
part
of
the
country
she
had
rained
since
noah
and
i
forgot
what
water
outside
a
pail
or
a
trough
looked
like
so
i
scouted
around
inside
of
me
to
see
what
part
of
the
world
i
jump
to
and
as
i
seemed
to
know
as
little
of
colorado
and
minin
as
anything
else
i
made
up
the
pint
of
bean
soup
i
call
my
brains
to
go
there
so
i
catches
me
a
buyer
at
henson
and
turns
over
my
pore
little
bunch
of
cattle
and
prepared
to
fly
the
last
day
i
hauled
up
about
twenty
good
buckets
of
water
and
threw
her
up
against
the
cabin
my
buyer
was
settin
his
hoss
for
me
to
get
ready
he
did
say
nothin
until
we
got
down
about
ten
mile
or
so
hicks
says
he
hesitatin
like
i
find
it
a
good
rule
in
this
country
not
to
overlook
other
folks
plays
but
i
take
it
mighty
kind
if
you
explain
those
actions
of
yours
with
the
pails
of
water
jones
says
i
it
very
simple
i
built
that
shack
five
year
ago
and
it
never
rained
since
i
just
wanted
to
settle
in
my
mind
whether
or
not
that
damn
roof
leaked
so
i
quit
arizona
and
in
about
a
week
i
see
my
reflection
in
the
winders
of
a
little
place
called
cyanide
in
the
colorado
mountains
fellows
she
was
a
bird
they
was
a
pony
in
sight
nor
a
foot
of
land
that
was
either
street
or
straight
up
it
made
me
plumb
lonesome
for
a
country
where
you
could
see
a
long
ways
even
if
you
did
see
much
and
this
early
in
the
evenin
they
was
hardly
anybody
in
the
streets
at
all
i
took
a
look
at
them
dark
gloomy
old
mountains
and
a
sniff
at
a
breeze
that
would
have
frozen
the
whiskers
of
hope
and
i
made
a
dive
for
the
nearest
lit
winder
they
was
a
sign
over
it
that
just
said
this
is
a
saloon
i
was
glad
they
labelled
her
i
never
have
known
it
they
had
a
old
kid
tendin
bar
no
games
goin
and
not
a
soul
in
the
place
sorry
to
disturb
your
repose
bub
says
i
but
see
if
you
can
sort
out
any
rye
among
them
collections
of
sassapariller
of
yours
i
took
a
drink
and
then
another
to
keep
it
company
i
was
beginnin
to
sympathise
with
anythin
lonesome
then
i
kind
of
sauntered
out
to
the
back
room
where
the
ought
to
be
sure
enough
there
was
a
girl
settin
on
the
pianner
stool
another
in
a
chair
and
a
nice
shiny
jew
drummer
danglin
his
feet
from
a
table
they
looked
up
when
they
see
me
come
in
and
went
right
on
talkin
hello
girls
says
i
at
that
they
stopped
talkin
complete
how
tricks
says
i
who
your
woolly
friend
the
shiny
jew
asks
of
the
girls
i
looked
at
him
a
minute
but
i
see
he
been
raised
a
pet
and
then
too
i
was
so
hungry
for
sassiety
i
was
willin
to
pass
a
bet
or
two
do
you
admire
these
cow
gents
snickers
one
of
the
girls
play
somethin
sister
says
i
to
the
one
at
the
pianner
she
just
grinned
at
me
interdooce
me
says
the
drummer
in
a
kind
of
a
way
that
made
them
all
laugh
a
heap
give
us
a
tune
i
begs
tryin
to
be
jolly
too
she
do
know
any
pieces
says
the
jew
do
you
i
asks
pretty
sharp
no
says
she
well
i
do
says
i
walked
up
to
her
jerked
out
my
guns
and
reached
around
both
sides
of
her
to
the
pianner
i
run
the
muzzles
up
and
down
the
keyboard
two
or
three
times
and
then
shot
out
half
a
dozen
keys
that
the
piece
i
know
says
i
but
the
other
girl
and
the
jew
drummer
had
punched
the
breeze
the
girl
at
the
pianner
just
grinned
and
pointed
to
the
winder
where
they
was
some
ragged
glass
hangin
she
was
dead
game
say
susie
says
i
you
all
right
but
your
friends
is
i
may
be
rough
and
i
ai
never
been
curried
below
the
knees
but
better
to
tie
to
than
them
sons
of
guns
i
believe
it
says
she
so
we
had
a
drink
at
the
bar
and
started
out
to
investigate
the
wonders
of
cyanide
say
that
night
was
a
wonder
susie
faded
after
about
three
drinks
but
i
did
seem
to
mind
that
i
hooked
up
to
another
saloon
kept
by
a
thin
dutchman
a
fat
dutchman
is
stupid
but
a
thin
one
is
all
right
in
ten
minutes
i
had
more
friends
in
cyanide
than
they
is
fiddlers
in
hell
i
begun
to
conclude
cyanide
was
so
lonesome
about
four
in
comes
a
little
irishman
about
four
foot
high
with
more
upper
lip
than
a
muley
cow
and
enough
red
hair
to
make
an
artificial
aurorer
borealis
he
had
big
red
hands
with
freckles
pasted
onto
them
and
stiff
red
hairs
standin
up
separate
and
lonesome
like
signal
stations
also
his
legs
was
bowed
he
gets
a
drink
at
the
bar
and
stands
back
and
yells
god
bless
the
irish
and
let
the
dutch
rustle
now
this
was
none
of
my
town
so
i
just
stepped
back
of
the
end
of
the
bar
quick
where
i
would
stop
no
lead
the
shootin
did
begin
probably
dutchy
did
take
no
note
of
what
the
locoed
little
dogie
did
say
thinks
i
to
myself
the
irishman
bellied
up
to
the
bar
again
and
pounded
on
it
with
his
fist
look
here
he
yells
listen
to
what
i
tellin
ye
god
bless
the
irish
and
let
the
dutch
rustle
do
ye
hear
me
sure
i
hear
ye
says
dutchy
and
goes
on
swabbin
his
bar
with
a
towel
at
that
my
soul
just
grew
sick
i
asked
the
man
next
to
me
why
dutchy
did
kill
the
little
fellow
kill
him
says
this
man
what
for
for
insultin
of
him
of
course
oh
he
drunk
says
the
man
as
if
that
explained
anythin
that
settled
it
with
me
i
left
that
place
and
went
home
and
it
was
more
than
four
neither
no
i
do
call
four
late
it
may
be
a
little
late
for
night
before
last
but
it
just
the
shank
of
the
evenin
for
well
it
took
me
six
weeks
and
two
days
to
go
broke
i
did
know
sic
em
about
minin
and
before
long
i
knew
that
i
did
sic
most
all
day
i
poked
around
them
mountains
like
too
much
timber
to
be
comfortable
at
night
i
got
to
droppin
in
at
dutchy
he
had
a
couple
of
quiet
games
goin
and
they
was
one
fellow
among
that
lot
of
grubbin
prairie
dogs
that
had
heerd
tell
that
cows
had
horns
he
was
the
wisest
of
the
bunch
on
the
cattle
business
so
i
stowed
away
my
consolation
and
made
out
to
forget
comparing
colorado
with
god
country
about
three
times
a
week
this
irishman
i
told
you
of
name
comes
bulgin
in
when
he
was
sober
he
talked
minin
high
wide
and
handsome
when
he
was
drunk
he
pounded
both
fists
on
the
bar
and
yelled
for
action
tryin
to
get
dutchy
on
the
peck
god
bless
the
irish
and
let
the
dutch
rustle
he
yells
about
six
times
say
do
you
hear
sure
says
dutchy
calm
as
a
milk
cow
sure
i
hears
ye
i
was
plumb
sorry
for
i
like
to
have
given
him
a
run
but
of
course
i
could
take
it
up
without
makin
myself
out
a
friend
of
this
dutchy
party
and
i
could
stand
for
that
but
i
did
tackle
dutchy
about
it
one
night
when
they
was
nobody
else
there
dutchy
says
i
what
makes
you
let
that
cross
between
a
bulldog
and
a
flamin
red
sunset
tromp
on
you
so
it
looks
to
me
like
you
plumb
spiritless
dutchy
stopped
wiping
glasses
for
a
minute
just
you
hold
on
says
he
i
ai
ready
yet
bimeby
i
make
him
sick
also
those
others
who
laugh
with
him
he
had
a
little
grey
flicker
in
his
eye
and
i
thinks
to
myself
that
maybe
they
get
dutchy
on
the
peck
yet
as
i
said
i
went
broke
in
just
six
weeks
and
two
days
and
i
was
broke
a
plenty
no
anywhere
it
was
a
heap
long
ways
to
cows
and
i
be
teetotally
chawed
up
and
spit
out
if
i
was
goin
to
join
these
minin
terrapins
defacin
the
bosom
of
nature
it
sure
looked
to
me
like
hard
work
while
i
was
figurin
what
next
dutchy
came
in
which
i
was
surprised
at
that
but
i
said
and
would
he
rest
his
poor
feet
you
like
to
make
some
money
he
asks
that
depends
says
i
on
how
easy
it
is
it
is
easy
says
he
i
want
you
to
buy
hosses
for
me
hosses
sure
i
yells
jumpin
up
you
bet
you
why
hosses
is
where
i
live
what
hosses
do
you
want
all
hosses
says
he
calm
as
a
faro
dealer
what
says
i
elucidate
my
bucko
i
do
take
no
such
blanket
order
spread
your
cards
i
mean
just
that
says
he
i
want
you
to
buy
all
the
hosses
in
this
camp
and
in
the
mountains
every
one
whew
i
whistles
that
a
large
order
but
i
your
meat
come
with
me
then
says
he
i
had
but
just
got
up
but
i
went
with
him
to
his
little
old
poison
factory
of
course
i
had
had
no
breakfast
but
he
staked
me
to
a
kentucky
breakfast
what
a
kentucky
breakfast
why
a
kentucky
breakfast
is
a
steak
a
bottle
of
whisky
and
a
setter
dog
what
the
dog
for
why
to
eat
the
steak
of
course
we
come
to
an
agreement
i
was
to
get
a
head
commission
so
i
started
out
there
was
many
hosses
in
that
country
and
what
there
was
the
owners
had
much
use
for
unless
it
was
to
work
a
whim
i
picked
up
about
a
hundred
head
quick
enough
and
reported
to
dutchy
how
about
burros
and
mules
i
asks
dutchy

two
hundred
animals

kept
them
over
the
hills

some
parks

meadows
in
that
country
i
rode
into

hear
them
at
denver
they
tell
me
and
the
weather
reports
said
thunder
in
the
mountains
but
it
was
cash
on
delivery
and
they
all
paid
up
they
had
seen
that
white
quartz
with
the
gold
stickin
into
it
and
that
the
same
as
a
dose
of
loco
to
miner
gents
why
did
i
take
a
hoss
and
start
first
i
did
think
of
it
for
about
one
second
i
would
stay
in
that
country
then
for
a
million
dollars
a
minute
i
was
plumb
sick
and
loathin
it
and
just
waitin
to
make
high
jumps
back
to
arizona
so
i
was
aimin
to
join
this
stampede
and
did
have
no
vivid
emotions
they
got
to
fightin
on
which
should
get
the
first
hoss
so
i
bent
my
gun
on
them
and
made
them
draw
lots
they
roared
some
more
but
done
so
and
as
fast
as
each
one
handed
over
his
dust
or
dinero
he
made
a
rush
for
his
cabin
piled
on
his
saddle
and
pack
and
pulled
his
freight
on
a
cloud
of
dust
it
was
sure
a
grand
stampede
and
i
enjoyed
it
no
limit
so
by
sundown
i
was
alone
with
the
injin
those
two
hundred
head
brought
in
about
twenty
thousand
dollars
it
was
heavy
but
i
could
carry
it
i
was
about
alone
in
the
landscape
and
there
were
the
two
best
hosses
i
had
saved
out
for
dutchy
i
was
sure
some
tempted
but
i
had
enough
to
get
home
on
anyway
and
i
never
yet
drank
behind
the
bar
even
if
i
might
hold
up
the
saloon
from
the
floor
so
i
grieved
some
inside
that
i
was
so
conscientious
shouldered
the
sacks
and
went
down
to
find
dutchy
i
met
him
headed
his
way
and
carryin
of
a
sheet
of
paper
here
your
dinero
says
i
dumpin
the
four
big
sacks
on
the
ground
he
stooped
over
and
hefted
them
then
he
passed
one
over
to
me
what
that
for
i
asks
for
you
says
he
my
commission
ai
that
much
i
objects
you
earned
it
says
he
and
you
might
have
skipped
with
the
whole
wad
how
did
you
know
i
would
i
asks
well
says
he
and
i
noted
that
jag
of
his
had
flew
you
see
i
was
behind
that
rock
up
there
and
i
had
you
covered
i
saw
and
i
began
to
feel
better
about
bein
so
conscientious
we
walked
a
little
ways
without
sayin
nothin
but
ai
you
goin
to
join
the
game
i
asks
guess
not
says
he
jinglin
of
his
gold
i
satisfied
but
if
you
do
get
a
wiggle
on
you
you
are
sure
goin
to
get
left
on
those
gold
claims
says
i
there
ai
no
gold
claims
says
he
but
henry
smith
i
cries
there
ai
no
henry
smith
says
he
i
let
that
soak
in
about
six
inches
but
there
a
buck
canon
i
pleads
please
say
there
a
buck
canon
oh
yes
there
a
buck
canon
he
allows
nice
limestone
formation
make
good
hard
water
well
you
a
marvel
says
i
we
walked
together
down
to
dutchy
saloon
we
stopped
outside
now
says
he
i
goin
to
take
one
of
those
hosses
and
go
somewheres
else
maybe
you
better
do
likewise
on
the
other
you
bet
i
will
says
i
he
turned
around
and
taked
up
the
paper
he
was
carryin
it
was
a
sign
it
read
the
dutch
has
rustled
nice
sentiment
says
i
it
will
be
appreciated
when
the
crowd
comes
back
from
that
little
pasear
into
buck
canon
but
why
not
tack
her
up
where
the
trail
hits
the
camp
why
on
this
particular
door
well
said
dutchy
squintin
at
the
sign
sideways
you
see
i
sold
this
place
day
before
yesterday
to
mike
chapter
eight
the
corral
branding
all
that
night
we
slept
like
sticks
of
wood
no
dreams
visited
us
but
in
accordance
with
the
immemorial
habit
of
those
who
live
out
whether
in
the
woods
on
the
plains
among
the
mountains
or
at
sea
once
during
the
night
each
of
us
rose
on
his
elbow
looked
about
him
and
dropped
back
to
sleep
if
there
had
been
a
fire
to
replenish
that
would
have
been
the
moment
to
do
so
if
the
wind
had
been
changing
and
the
seas
rising
that
would
have
been
the
time
to
cast
an
eye
aloft
for
indications
to
feel
whether
the
anchor
cable
was
holding
if
the
had
straggled
from
the
alpine
meadows
under
the
snows
this
would
have
been
the
occasion
for
intent
listening
for
the
faintly
tinkling
hell
so
that
next
day
one
would
know
in
which
direction
to
look
but
since
there
existed
for
us
no
responsibility
we
each
reported
dutifully
at
the
of
habit
and
dropped
back
into
our
blankets
with
a
grateful
sigh
i
remember
the
moon
sailing
a
good
gait
among
apparently
stationary
cloudlets
i
recall
a
deep
black
shadow
lying
before
distant
silvery
mountains
i
glanced
over
the
stark
motionless
canvases
each
of
which
concealed
a
man
the
air
trembled
with
the
bellowing
of
cattle
in
the
corrals
seemingly
but
a
moment
later
the
cook
howl
brought
me
to
consciousness
again
a
clear
licking
little
fire
danced
in
the
blackness
before
it
moved
silhouettes
of
men
already
eating
i
piled
out
and
joined
the
group
homer
was
busy
distributing
his
men
for
the
day
three
were
to
care
for
the
remuda
five
were
to
move
the
from
the
corrals
to
good
feed
three
branding
crews
were
told
to
brand
the
calves
we
had
collected
in
the
cut
of
the
afternoon
before
that
took
up
about
half
the
men
the
rest
were
to
make
a
short
drive
in
the
salt
grass
i
joined
the
cattleman
and
together
we
made
our
way
afoot
to
the
branding
pen
we
were
the
only
ones
who
did
go
afoot
however
although
the
corrals
were
not
more
than
two
hundred
yards
distant
when
we
arrived
we
found
the
string
of
ponies
standing
around
outside
between
the
upright
bars
of
greasewood
we
could
see
the
cattle
and
near
the
opposite
side
the
men
building
a
fire
next
the
fence
we
pushed
open
the
wide
gate
and
entered
the
three
ropers
sat
their
horses
idly
swinging
the
loops
of
their
ropes
back
and
forth
three
others
brought
wood
and
arranged
it
craftily
in
such
manner
as
to
get
best
draught
for
heatin
a
good
branding
fire
is
most
decidedly
a
work
of
art
one
stood
waiting
for
them
to
finish
a
sheaf
of
long
jh
stamping
irons
in
his
hand
all
the
rest
squatted
on
their
heels
along
the
fence
smoking
cigarettes
and
chatting
together
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
slanted
across
in
one
great
sweep
from
the
remote
mountains
in
ten
minutes
charley
pronounced
the
irons
ready
homer
wooden
and
old
california
john
rode
in
among
the
cattle
the
rest
of
the
men
arose
and
stretched
their
legs
and
advanced
the
cattleman
and
i
climbed
to
the
top
bar
of
the
gate
where
we
roosted
he
with
his
on
his
knee
each
rider
swung
his
rope
above
his
head
with
one
hand
keeping
the
broad
loop
open
by
a
skilful
turn
of
the
wrist
at
the
end
of
each
revolution
in
a
moment
homer
leaned
forward
and
threw
as
the
loop
settled
he
jerked
sharply
upward
exactly
as
one
would
strike
to
hook
a
big
fish
this
tightened
the
loop
and
prevented
it
from
slipping
off
immediately
and
without
waiting
to
ascertain
the
result
of
the
manoeuvre
the
horse
turned
and
began
methodically
without
undue
haste
to
walk
toward
the
branding
fire
homer
wrapped
the
rope
twice
or
thrice
about
the
horn
and
sat
over
in
one
stirrup
to
avoid
the
tightened
line
and
to
preserve
the
balance
nobody
paid
any
attention
to
the
calf
the
critter
had
been
caught
by
the
two
hind
legs
as
the
rope
tightened
he
was
suddenly
upset
and
before
he
could
realise
that
something
disagreeable
was
happening
he
was
sliding
majestically
along
on
his
belly
behind
him
followed
his
anxious
mother
her
head
swinging
from
side
to
side
near
the
fire
the
horse
stopped
the
two
immediately
pounced
upon
the
victim
it
was
promptly
flopped
over
on
its
right
side
one
knelt
on
its
head
and
twisted
back
its
foreleg
in
a
sort
of
the
other
seized
one
hind
foot
pressed
his
boot
heel
against
the
other
hind
leg
close
to
the
body
and
sat
down
behind
the
animal
thus
the
calf
was
unable
to
struggle
when
once
you
have
had
the
wind
knocked
out
of
you
or
a
rib
or
two
broken
you
cease
to
think
this
unnecessarily
rough
then
one
or
the
other
threw
off
the
rope
homer
rode
away
coiling
the
rope
as
he
went
hot
iron
yelled
one
of
the
marker
yelled
the
other
immediately
two
men
ran
forward
the
brander
pressed
the
iron
smoothly
against
the
flank
a
smoke
and
the
smell
of
scorching
hair
arose
perhaps
the
calf
blatted
a
little
as
the
heat
scorched
in
a
brief
moment
it
was
over
the
brand
showed
cherry
which
is
the
proper
colour
to
indicate
due
peeling
and
a
successful
mark
in
the
meantime
the
marker
was
engaged
in
his
work
first
with
a
sharp
knife
he
cut
off
slanting
the
upper
quarter
of
one
ear
then
he
nicked
out
a
in
the
other
the
pieces
he
thrust
into
his
pocket
in
order
that
at
the
completion
of
the
work
he
could
thus
check
the
cattleman
as
to
the
number
of
calves
branded
the
let
go
the
calf
sprang
up
was
appropriated
and
smelled
over
by
his
worried
mother
and
the
two
departed
into
the
herd
to
talk
it
over
it
seems
to
me
that
a
great
deal
of
unnecessary
twaddle
is
abroad
as
to
the
extreme
cruelty
of
branding
undoubtedly
it
is
to
some
extent
painful
and
could
some
other
method
of
ready
identification
be
devised
it
might
be
as
well
to
adopt
it
in
preference
but
in
the
circumstance
of
a
free
range
thousands
of
cattle
and
hundreds
of
owners
any
other
method
is
out
of
the
question
i
remember
a
new
england
movement
looking
toward
small
brass
tags
to
be
hung
from
the
ear
inextinguishable
laughter
followed
the
spread
of
this
doctrine
through
arizona
imagine
a
puncher
descending
to
examine
politely
the
of
wild
cattle
on
the
open
range
or
in
a
but
as
i
have
intimated
even
the
inevitable
branding
and
are
not
so
painful
as
one
might
suppose
the
scorching
hardly
penetrates
below
the
outer
tough
skin
only
enough
to
kill
the
roots
of
the
hair
besides
which
it
must
be
remembered
that
cattle
are
not
so
sensitive
as
the
higher
nervous
organisms
a
calf
usually
bellows
when
the
iron
bites
but
as
soon
as
released
he
almost
invariably
goes
to
feeding
or
to
looking
idly
about
indeed
i
have
never
seen
one
even
take
the
trouble
to
lick
his
wounds
which
is
certainly
not
true
in
the
case
of
the
injuries
they
inflict
on
each
other
in
fighting
besides
which
it
happens
but
once
in
a
lifetime
and
is
over
in
ten
seconds
a
comfort
denied
to
those
of
us
who
have
our
teeth
filled
in
the
meantime
two
other
calves
had
been
roped
by
the
two
other
men
one
of
the
little
animals
was
but
a
few
months
old
so
the
rider
did
not
bother
with
its
hind
legs
but
tossed
his
loop
over
its
neck
naturally
when
things
tightened
up
calf
entered
his
objections
which
took
the
form
of
most
vigorous
bawlings
and
the
most
comical
bucking
pitching
cavorting
and
bounding
in
the
air
mr
alone
in
pictorial
history
shows
the
attitudes
and
then
of
course
there
was
the
gorgeous
contrast
between
all
this
frantic
and
uncomprehending
excitement
and
the
absolute
imperturbability
of
horse
and
rider
once
at
the
fire
one
of
the
men
seized
the
tightened
rope
in
one
hand
reached
well
over
the
back
to
get
a
slack
of
the
loose
hide
next
the
belly
lifted
strongly
and
tripped
this
is
called
as
he
knew
his
business
and
as
the
calf
was
a
small
one
the
little
beast
went
over
promptly
bit
the
ground
with
a
whack
and
was
pounced
upon
and
held
such
good
luck
did
not
always
follow
however
an
occasional
and
exceedingly
husky
bull
yearling
declined
to
be
upset
in
any
such
manner
he
would
catch
himself
on
one
foot
scramble
vigorously
and
end
by
struggling
back
to
the
upright
then
ten
to
one
he
made
a
dash
to
get
away
in
such
case
he
was
generally
snubbed
up
short
enough
at
the
end
of
the
rope
but
once
or
twice
he
succeeded
in
running
around
a
group
absorbed
in
branding
you
can
imagine
what
happened
next
the
rope
attached
at
one
end
to
a
conscientious
and
immovable
horse
and
at
the
other
to
a
reckless
and
vigorous
little
bull
swept
its
taut
and
destroying
way
about
high
across
that
group
the
brander
and
marker
who
were
standing
promptly
sat
down
hard
the
who
were
sitting
immediately
turned
several
most
capable
somersaults
the
other
calf
arose
and
inextricably
entangled
his
rope
with
that
of
his
accomplice
hot
irons
hot
language
and
dust
filled
the
air
another
method
and
one
requiring
slightly
more
knack
is
to
grasp
the
animal
tail
and
throw
it
by
a
quick
jerk
across
the
pressure
of
the
rope
this
is
productive
of
some
fun
if
it
fails
by
now
the
branding
was
in
full
swing
the
three
horses
came
and
went
phlegmatically
when
the
nooses
fell
they
turned
and
walked
toward
the
fire
as
a
matter
of
course
rarely
did
the
cast
fail
men
ran
to
and
fro
busy
and
intent
sometimes
three
or
four
calves
were
on
the
ground
at
once
cries
arose
in
a
confusion
marker
hot
iron
tally
one
dust
eddied
and
dissipated
behind
all
were
clear
sunlight
and
the
organ
roll
of
the
cattle
bellowing
toward
the
middle
of
the
morning
the
began
to
get
a
little
tired
no
more
necked
calves
they
announced
catch
by
the
hind
legs
or
yourself
and
that
went
once
in
a
while
the
rider
lazy
or
careless
or
bothered
by
the
press
of
numbers
dragged
up
a
victim
caught
by
the
neck
the
flatly
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
an
obvious
way
out
would
have
been
to
flip
off
the
loop
and
try
again
but
of
course
that
would
have
amounted
to
a
confession
of
wrong
you
fellows
drive
me
plumb
weary
remarked
the
rider
slowly
dismounting
a
little
bit
of
a
calf
like
that
what
you
all
need
is
a
nigger
to
cut
up
your
food
for
you
then
he
would
spit
on
his
hands
and
go
at
it
alone
if
luck
attended
his
first
effort
his
sarcasm
was
profound
there
yore
little
calf
said
he
would
you
like
to
have
me
tote
it
to
you
or
do
you
reckon
you
could
toddle
this
far
with
yore
little
old
iron
but
if
the
calf
gave
much
trouble
then
all
work
ceased
while
the
unfortunate
puncher
wrestled
it
down
toward
noon
the
work
slacked
unbranded
calves
were
scarce
sometimes
the
men
rode
here
and
there
for
a
minute
or
so
before
their
eyes
fell
on
a
pair
of
uncropped
ears
finally
homer
rode
over
to
the
cattleman
and
reported
the
branding
finished
the
latter
counted
the
marks
in
his
one
hundred
and
he
announced
the
markers
squatted
on
their
heels
told
over
the
bits
of
ears
they
had
saved
the
total
amounted
to
but
an
hundred
and
everybody
went
to
searching
for
the
missing
bit
it
was
not
finally
wooden
discovered
it
in
his
hip
pocket
felt
her
thar
all
the
time
said
he
but
thought
it
must
shorely
be
a
chaw
of
tobacco
this
matter
satisfactorily
adjusted
the
men
all
ran
for
their
ponies
they
had
been
doing
a
wrestler
heavy
work
all
the
morning
but
did
not
seem
to
be
tired
i
saw
once
in
some
crank
physical
culture
periodical
that
a
cowboy
life
was
physically
like
an
oarsman
in
that
it
exercised
only
certain
muscles
of
the
body
the
writer
should
be
turned
loose
in
a
branding
corral
through
the
wide
gates
the
cattle
were
urged
out
to
the
open
plain
there
they
were
held
for
over
an
hour
while
the
cows
wandered
about
looking
for
their
lost
progeny
a
cow
knows
her
calf
by
scent
and
sound
not
by
sight
therefore
the
noise
was
deafening
and
the
motion
incessant
finally
the
last
and
most
foolish
cow
found
the
last
and
most
foolish
calf
we
turned
the
herd
loose
to
hunt
water
and
grass
at
its
own
pleasure
and
went
slowly
back
to
chuck
for
the
benefit
of
the
squeamish
it
might
be
well
to
note
that
the
fragments
of
the
ears
were
cartilaginous
and
therefore
not
bloody
chapter
nine
the
old
timer
about
a
week
later
in
the
course
of
the
we
reached
the
valley
of
the
box
springs
where
we
camped
for
some
days
at
the
dilapidated
and
abandoned
adobe
structure
that
had
once
been
a
ranch
house
of
some
importance
just
at
dusk
one
afternoon
we
finished
cutting
the
herd
which
our
morning
drive
had
collected
the
with
its
new
additions
from
the
day
work
we
pushed
rapidly
into
one
big
stock
corral
the
cows
and
unbranded
calves
we
urged
into
another
fifty
head
of
beef
steers
found
asylum
from
dust
heat
and
racing
to
and
fro
in
the
mile
square
wire
enclosure
called
the
pasture
all
the
remainder
for
which
we
had
no
further
use
we
drove
out
of
the
flat
into
the
brush
and
toward
the
distant
mountains
then
we
let
them
go
as
best
pleased
them
by
now
the
desert
bad
turned
and
the
brush
was
olive
green
with
evening
the
hard
uncompromising
ranges
twenty
miles
to
eastward
had
softened
behind
a
wonderful
veil
of
purple
and
pink
vivid
as
the
chiffon
of
a
girl
gown
to
the
south
and
southwest
the
chiricahuas
and
dragoons
were
lost
in
thunderclouds
which
flashed
and
rumbled
we
jogged
homewards
our
cutting
ponies
tired
with
the
quick
sharp
work
shuffling
knee
deep
in
a
dusk
that
seemed
to
disengage
itself
and
rise
upwards
from
the
surface
of
the
desert
everybody
was
hungry
and
tired
at
the
chuck
wagon
we
threw
off
our
saddles
and
turned
the
mounts
into
the
remuda
some
of
the
wisest
of
us
remembering
the
thunderclouds
stacked
our
gear
under
the
veranda
roof
of
the
old
ranch
house
supper
was
ready
we
seized
the
tin
battery
filled
the
plates
with
the
meat
bread
and
canned
corn
and
squatted
on
our
heels
the
food
was
good
and
we
ate
hugely
in
silence
when
we
could
hold
no
more
we
lit
pipes
then
we
had
leisure
to
notice
that
the
storm
cloud
was
mounting
in
a
portentous
silence
to
the
zenith
quenching
the
brilliant
desert
stars
rolls
were
scattered
everywhere
a
roll
includes
a
cowboy
bed
and
all
of
his
personal
belongings
when
the
outfit
includes
a
the
roll
assumes
bulky
proportions
as
soon
as
we
had
come
to
a
definite
conclusion
that
it
was
going
to
rain
we
deserted
the
camp
fire
and
went
rustling
for
our
blankets
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
every
bed
was
safe
within
the
doors
of
the
abandoned
adobe
ranch
house
each
owner
recumbent
on
the
floor
claim
he
had
and
every
man
hoping
fervently
that
he
had
guessed
right
as
to
the
location
of
leaks
ordinarily
we
had
depended
on
the
light
of
camp
fires
so
now
artificial
illumination
lacked
each
man
was
indicated
by
the
alternately
glowing
and
waning
lozenge
of
his
cigarette
fire
occasionally
someone
struck
a
match
revealing
for
a
moment
on
bronzed
countenances
and
the
silhouette
of
a
shading
hand
voices
spoke
disembodied
as
the
conversation
developed
we
gradually
recognised
the
membership
of
our
own
roomful
i
had
forgotten
to
state
that
the
ranch
house
included
four
chambers
outside
the
rain
roared
with
arizona
ferocity
inside
men
congratulated
themselves
or
swore
as
leaks
developed
and
localised
naturally
we
talked
first
of
stampedes
cows
and
bears
are
the
two
great
topics
then
we
had
a
solo
or
two
which
naturally
led
on
to
songs
my
turn
came
i
struck
up
the
first
verse
of
a
sailor
chantey
as
possessing
at
least
the
interest
of
novelty
oh
once
we
were
were
we
blow
high
blow
low
what
care
we
and
we
were
to
see
what
we
could
see
down
on
the
coast
of
the
high
barbaree
i
had
just
gone
so
far
when
i
was
brought
up
short
by
a
tremendous
oath
behind
me
at
the
same
instant
a
match
flared
i
turned
to
face
a
stranger
holding
the
little
light
above
his
head
and
peering
with
fiery
intentness
over
the
group
sprawled
about
the
floor
he
was
evidently
just
in
from
the
storm
his
dripping
hat
lay
at
his
feet
a
shock
of
straight
vigorous
hair
stood
up
grey
above
his
seamed
forehead
bushy
eyebrows
drawn
close
together
thatched
a
pair
of
burning
unquenchable
eyes
a
square
deep
jaw
lightly
stubbled
with
grey
was
clamped
so
tight
that
the
cheek
muscles
above
it
stood
out
in
knots
and
welts
then
the
match
burned
his
thick
square
fingers
and
he
dropped
it
into
the
darkness
that
ascended
to
swallow
it
who
was
singing
that
song
he
cried
harshly
nobody
answered
who
was
that
singing
he
demanded
again
by
this
time
i
had
recovered
from
my
first
astonishment
i
was
singing
said
i
another
match
was
instantly
lit
and
thrust
into
my
very
face
i
underwent
the
fierce
scrutiny
of
an
instant
then
the
taper
was
thrown
away
half
consumed
where
did
you
learn
it
the
stranger
asked
in
an
altered
voice
i
do
remember
i
replied
it
is
a
common
enough
chantey
a
heavy
pause
fell
finally
the
stranger
sighed
quite
like
he
said
i
never
heard
but
one
man
sing
it
who
in
hell
are
you
someone
demanded
out
of
the
darkness
before
replying
the
newcomer
lit
a
third
match
searching
for
a
place
to
sit
down
as
he
bent
forward
his
strong
harsh
face
once
more
came
clearly
into
view
he
colorado
rogers
the
cattleman
answered
for
him
i
know
him
well
insisted
the
first
voice
what
in
hell
does
colorado
rogers
mean
by
bustin
in
on
our
song
fiesta
that
way
tell
them
rogers
advised
the
cattleman
tell
them
just
as
you
told
it
down
on
the
gila
ten
years
ago
next
month
what
inquired
rogers
who
are
you
you
do
know
me
replied
the
cattleman
but
i
was
with
buck
johnson
outfit
then
give
us
the
yarn
well
agreed
rogers
pass
over
the
and
i
will
he
rolled
and
lit
a
cigarette
while
i
revelled
in
the
memory
of
his
rich
great
voice
it
was
of
the
sort
made
to
declaim
against
the
sea
or
the
rush
of
rivers
or
as
here
the
fall
of
waters
and
the
thunder
full
from
the
chest
with
the
caressing
throat
vibration
that
gives
colour
to
the
most
ordinary
statements
after
ten
words
we
sank
back
oblivious
of
the
storm
forgetful
of
the
leaky
roof
and
the
dirty
floor
lost
in
the
story
told
us
by
the
old
timer
chapter
ten
the
texas
rangers
i
came
from
texas
like
the
bulk
of
you
punchers
but
a
good
while
before
the
most
of
you
were
born
that
was
years
ago
and
i
been
on
the
colorado
river
ever
since
that
why
they
call
me
colorado
rogers
about
a
dozen
of
us
came
out
together
we
had
all
been
texas
rangers
but
when
the
war
broke
out
we
were
out
of
a
job
we
none
of
us
cared
much
for
the
johnny
rebs
and
still
less
for
the
yanks
so
we
struck
overland
for
the
west
with
the
idea
of
hitting
the
california
diggings
well
we
got
switched
off
one
way
and
another
when
we
got
down
to
about
where
douglas
is
now
we
found
that
the
mexican
government
was
offering
a
bounty
for
apache
scalps
that
looked
pretty
good
to
us
for
injin
chasing
was
our
job
so
we
started
in
to
collect
did
pretty
well
too
for
about
three
months
and
then
the
injins
began
to
get
too
scarce
or
too
plenty
in
streaks
looked
like
our
job
was
over
with
but
some
of
the
boys
discovered
that
mexicans
having
straight
black
hair
you
could
tell
one
of
their
scalps
from
an
apache
after
that
the
bounty
business
picked
up
for
a
while
it
was
too
much
for
me
though
and
i
quit
the
outfit
and
pushed
on
alone
until
i
struck
the
colorado
about
where
yuma
is
now
at
that
time
the
california
immigrants
by
the
southern
route
used
to
cross
just
there
and
these
yuma
injins
had
a
monopoly
on
the
ferry
business
they
were
a
peaceful
lot
without
a
thing
on
but
a
the
women
had
belts
with
rawhide
strings
hanging
to
the
knees
they
put
them
on
one
over
the
other
until
they
did
feel
too
decollotey
it
was
until
the
soldiers
came
that
the
wives
got
them
to
wear
handkerchiefs
over
their
breasts
the
system
was
all
right
though
they
wallowed
around
in
the
hot
clean
sand
like
chickens
and
kept
healthy
since
they
took
to
wearing
clothes
they
been
petering
out
and
dying
of
dirt
and
assorted
diseases
they
ran
this
ferry
monopoly
by
means
of
boats
made
of
tules
charged
a
low
price
and
everything
was
happy
and
lovely
i
ran
on
a
little
bar
and
panned
out
some
dust
so
i
camped
a
while
washing
gold
getting
friendly
with
the
yumas
and
talking
horse
and
other
things
with
the
immigrants
about
a
month
of
this
and
the
texas
boys
drifted
in
seems
they
sort
of
overdid
the
scalp
matter
and
got
found
out
when
they
saw
me
they
stopped
and
went
into
camp
they
travelled
a
heap
of
desert
and
were
getting
sick
of
it
for
a
while
they
tried
gold
washing
but
i
had
the
only
pocket
and
that
was
about
skinned
one
evening
a
fellow
named
walleye
announced
that
he
had
been
doing
some
figuring
and
wanted
to
make
a
speech
we
told
him
to
fire
ahead
now
look
here
said
he
what
the
use
of
going
to
california
why
not
stay
here
what
in
hell
would
we
do
here
someone
asked
collect
gila
monsters
for
their
good
looks
do
get
gay
said
walleye
what
the
matter
with
going
into
business
here
a
heap
of
people
going
through
and
more
coming
every
day
this
ferry
business
could
be
made
to
pay
big
them
injins
charges
two
bits
a
head
that
a
crime
for
the
only
way
across
and
how
much
do
you
suppose
whisky
be
worth
to
drink
after
that
desert
and
a
man
so
sick
of
himself
by
the
time
he
gets
this
far
that
play
let
alone
faro
or
monte
that
kind
of
talk
hit
them
where
they
lived
and
yuma
was
founded
right
then
and
there
they
had
any
whisky
yet
but
cards
were
plenty
and
the
ferry
monopoly
was
too
easy
walleye
served
notice
on
the
injins
that
a
dollar
a
head
went
and
we
all
set
to
building
a
tule
raft
like
the
others
then
the
wild
bunch
got
uneasy
so
they
walked
upstream
one
morning
and
stole
the
injins
boats
the
injins
came
after
them
innocent
as
babies
thinking
the
raft
had
gone
adrift
when
they
got
into
camp
our
men
opened
up
and
killed
four
of
them
as
a
kind
of
hint
after
that
the
ferry
company
did
have
any
trouble
the
yumas
moved
up
river
a
ways
where
they
lived
ever
since
they
got
the
corpses
and
buried
them
that
is
they
dug
a
trench
for
each
one
and
laid
poles
across
it
with
a
funeral
pyre
on
the
poles
then
they
put
the
body
on
top
and
the
women
of
the
family
cut
their
hair
off
and
threw
it
on
after
that
they
set
fire
to
the
outfit
and
when
the
poles
bad
burned
through
the
whole
business
fell
into
the
trench
of
its
own
accord
it
was
the
neatest
automatic
sort
of
a
funeral
i
ever
saw
there
was
any
ceremony
only
crying
the
ferry
business
flourished
at
prices
which
were
sometimes
hard
to
collect
but
it
was
a
case
of
pay
or
go
back
and
it
was
a
long
ways
back
we
got
us
timbers
and
made
a
scow
built
a
baile
and
saloon
and
houses
out
of
adobe
and
called
her
yuma
after
the
injins
that
had
really
started
her
we
got
our
supplies
through
the
gulf
of
california
where
sailing
boats
worked
up
the
river
people
began
to
come
in
for
one
reason
or
another
and
first
thing
we
knew
we
had
a
store
and
all
sorts
of
trimmings
in
fact
we
was
a
real
live
town
chapter
eleven
the
sailor
with
one
hand
at
this
moment
the
heavy
beat
of
the
storm
on
the
roof
ceased
with
miraculous
suddenness
leaving
the
outside
world
empty
of
sound
save
for
the
drip
drip
drip
of
eaves
nobody
ventured
to
fill
in
the
pause
that
followed
the
stranger
last
words
so
in
a
moment
he
continued
his
narrative
we
had
every
sort
of
people
with
us
off
and
on
and
as
i
was
lookout
at
a
popular
game
i
saw
them
all
one
evening
i
was
on
my
way
home
about
two
of
a
moonlit
night
when
on
the
edge
of
the
shadow
i
stumbled
over
a
body
lying
part
across
the
footway
at
the
same
instant
i
heard
the
rip
of
steel
through
cloth
and
felt
a
sharp
stab
in
my
left
leg
for
a
minute
i
thought
some
drunk
had
used
his
knife
on
me
and
i
mighty
near
derringered
him
as
he
lay
but
somehow
i
did
and
looking
closer
i
saw
the
man
was
unconscious
then
i
scouted
to
see
what
had
cut
me
and
found
that
the
fellow
had
lost
a
hand
in
place
of
it
he
wore
a
sharp
steel
hook
this
i
had
tangled
up
with
and
gotten
well
pricked
i
dragged
him
out
into
the
light
he
was
a
young
fellow
with
straight
black
hair
long
and
lank
and
oily
a
lean
face
and
big
hooked
nose
he
had
on
only
a
thin
shirt
a
pair
of
rough
wool
pants
and
the
rawhide
zapatos
the
mexicans
wore
then
instead
of
boots
across
his
forehead
ran
a
long
gash
cutting
his
left
eyebrow
square
in
two
there
was
no
doubt
of
his
being
alive
for
he
was
breathing
hard
like
a
man
does
when
he
gets
hit
over
the
head
it
did
sound
good
when
a
man
breathes
that
way
he
mostly
all
gone
well
it
was
really
none
of
my
business
as
you
might
say
men
got
batted
over
the
head
often
enough
in
those
days
but
for
some
reason
i
picked
him
up
and
carried
him
to
my
shack
and
laid
him
out
and
washed
his
cut
with
sour
wine
that
brought
him
to
sour
wine
is
fine
to
put
a
wound
in
shape
to
heal
but
it
no
soothing
syrup
he
sat
up
as
though
he
been
touched
with
a
hot
poker
stared
around
and
cut
loose
with
that
song
you
were
singing
only
it
was
that
verse
it
was
another
one
further
along
that
went
like
this
their
coffin
was
their
ship
and
their
grave
it
was
the
sea
blow
high
blow
low
what
care
we
and
the
quarter
that
we
gave
them
was
to
sink
them
in
the
sea
down
on
the
coast
of
the
high
barbaree
it
fair
made
my
hair
rise
to
hear
him
with
the
big
still
solemn
desert
outside
and
the
quiet
moonlight
and
the
shadows
and
him
sitting
up
straight
and
gaunt
his
eyes
blazing
each
side
his
big
eagle
nose
and
his
snaky
hair
hanging
over
the
raw
cut
across
his
head
however
i
made
out
to
get
him
bandaged
up
and
in
shape
and
pretty
soon
he
sort
of
went
to
sleep
well
he
was
clean
out
of
his
head
for
nigh
two
weeks
most
of
the
time
he
lay
flat
on
his
back
staring
at
the
pole
roof
his
eyes
burning
and
looking
like
they
saw
each
one
something
a
different
distance
off
the
way
crazy
eyes
do
that
was
when
he
was
best
then
again
sing
that
barbaree
song
until
i
go
out
and
look
at
the
old
colorado
flowing
by
just
to
be
sure
i
had
died
and
gone
below
or
else
just
talk
that
was
the
worst
performance
of
all
it
was
like
listening
to
one
end
of
a
telephone
though
we
did
know
what
telephones
were
in
those
days
he
began
when
he
was
a
kid
and
he
gave
his
side
of
conversations
pausing
for
replies
i
could
mighty
near
furnish
the
replies
sometimes
it
was
queer
lingo
about
ships
and
ships
officers
and
gales
and
calms
and
fights
and
pearls
and
whales
and
islands
and
birds
and
skies
but
it
was
all
little
stuff
i
used
to
listen
by
the
hour
but
i
never
made
out
anything
really
important
as
to
who
the
man
was
or
where
he
come
from
or
what
he
done
at
the
end
of
the
second
week
i
came
in
at
noon
as
per
usual
to
fix
him
up
with
grub
i
did
pay
any
attention
to
him
for
he
was
quiet
as
i
was
bending
over
the
fire
he
spoke
usually
i
did
bother
with
his
talk
for
it
did
mean
anything
but
something
in
his
voice
made
me
turn
he
was
lying
on
his
side
those
black
eyes
of
his
blazing
at
me
but
now
both
of
them
saw
the
same
distance
where
are
my
clothes
he
asked
very
intense
you
ai
in
any
shape
to
want
clothes
said
i
lie
still
i
had
any
more
than
got
the
words
out
of
my
mouth
before
he
was
atop
me
his
method
was
a
winner
he
had
me
by
the
throat
with
his
hand
and
i
felt
the
point
of
the
hook
pricking
the
back
of
my
neck
one
little
squeeze
talk
about
your
deadly
weapons
but
he
been
too
sick
and
too
long
abed
he
turned
dizzy
and
keeled
over
and
i
dumped
him
back
on
the
bunk
then
i
put
my
on
in
a
minute
or
so
he
came
to
now
you
a
nice
sweet
proposition
said
i
as
soon
as
i
was
sure
he
could
understand
me
here
i
pick
you
up
on
the
street
and
save
your
worthless
carcass
and
the
first
chance
you
get
you
try
to
crawl
my
hump
explain
where
my
clothes
he
demanded
again
very
fierce
for
heaven
sake
i
yelled
at
him
what
the
matter
with
you
and
your
old
clothes
there
ai
enough
of
them
to
dust
a
fiddle
with
anyway
what
do
you
think
i
want
with
them
they
safe
enough
let
me
have
them
he
begged
now
look
here
said
i
you
ca
get
up
you
ai
fit
i
know
he
pleaded
but
let
me
see
them
just
to
satisfy
him
i
passed
over
his
old
duds
i
been
robbed
he
cried
well
said
i
what
did
you
expect
would
happen
to
you
lying
around
yuma
after
midnight
with
a
hole
in
your
head
where
my
coat
he
asked
you
had
no
coat
when
i
picked
you
up
i
replied
he
looked
at
me
mighty
suspicious
but
did
say
anything
more
he
would
even
answer
when
i
spoke
to
him
after
he
eaten
a
fair
meal
he
fell
asleep
when
i
came
back
that
evening
the
bunk
was
empty
and
he
was
gone
i
did
see
him
again
for
two
days
then
i
caught
sight
of
him
quite
a
ways
off
he
nodded
at
me
very
sour
and
dodged
around
the
corner
of
the
store
guess
he
suspicions
i
stole
that
old
coat
of
his
thinks
i
and
afterwards
i
found
that
my
surmise
had
been
correct
however
he
did
stay
long
in
that
frame
of
mind
it
was
along
towards
evening
and
i
was
walking
on
the
banks
looking
down
over
the
muddy
old
colorado
as
i
always
liked
to
do
the
sun
had
just
set
and
the
mountains
had
turned
hard
and
stiff
as
they
do
after
the
glow
and
the
sky
above
them
was
a
thousand
million
miles
deep
of
pale
light
a
pair
of
greasers
were
ahead
of
me
but
i
could
see
only
their
outlines
and
they
did
seem
to
interfere
any
with
the
scenery
suddenly
a
black
figure
seemed
to
rise
up
out
of
the
ground
the
mexican
man
went
down
as
though
he
been
jerked
with
a
string
and
the
woman
screeched
i
ran
up
pulling
my
gun
the
mex
was
flat
on
his
face
his
arms
stretched
out
on
the
middle
of
his
back
knelt
my
friend
and
that
sharp
hook
was
caught
neatly
under
the
point
of
the
jaw
you
bet
he
lay
still
i
really
think
i
was
just
in
time
to
save
the
man
life
according
to
my
belief
another
minute
would
have
buried
the
hook
in
the
neck
anyway
i
thrust
the
muzzle
of
my
colt
into
the
sailor
face
what
this
i
asked
the
sailor
looked
up
at
me
without
changing
his
position
he
was
not
the
least
bit
afraid
this
man
has
my
coat
he
explained
where
you
get
the
coat
i
asked
the
mex
i
ween
heem
at
monte
off
antonio
curvez
said
he
maybe
growled
the
sailor
he
still
held
the
hook
under
the
man
jaw
but
with
the
other
hand
he
ran
rapidly
under
and
over
the
mexican
left
shoulder
in
the
half
light
i
could
see
his
face
change
the
gleam
died
from
his
eye
the
snarl
left
his
lips
without
further
delay
he
arose
to
his
feet
get
up
and
give
it
here
he
demanded
the
mexican
was
only
too
glad
to
get
off
so
easy
i
do
know
whether
he
really
won
the
coat
at
monte
or
not
in
any
case
he
flew
poco
pronto
leaving
me
and
my
friend
together
the
man
with
the
hook
felt
the
left
shoulder
of
the
coat
again
looked
up
met
my
eye
muttered
something
intended
to
be
pleasant
and
walked
away
this
was
in
december
during
the
next
two
months
he
was
a
good
deal
about
town
mostly
doing
odd
jobs
i
saw
him
off
and
on
he
always
spoke
to
me
as
pleasantly
as
he
knew
how
and
once
made
some
sort
of
a
bluff
about
paying
me
back
for
my
trouble
in
bringing
him
around
however
i
did
pay
much
attention
to
that
being
at
the
time
almighty
busy
holding
down
my
card
games
the
last
day
of
february
i
was
sitting
in
my
shack
smoking
a
pipe
after
supper
when
my
friend
opened
the
door
a
foot
slipped
in
and
shut
it
immediately
by
the
time
he
looked
towards
me
i
knew
where
my
was
that
all
right
said
i
but
you
better
stay
right
there
i
intended
to
take
no
more
chances
with
that
hook
he
stood
there
looking
straight
at
me
without
winking
or
offering
to
move
what
do
you
want
i
asked
i
want
to
make
up
to
you
for
your
trouble
said
he
i
got
a
good
thing
and
i
want
to
let
you
in
on
it
what
kind
of
a
good
thing
i
asked
treasure
said
he
h
said
i
examined
him
closely
he
looked
all
right
enough
neither
drunk
nor
loco
sit
down
said
i
over
there
the
other
side
the
table
he
did
so
now
fire
away
said
i
he
told
me
his
name
was
solomon
anderson
but
that
he
was
generally
known
as
handy
solomon
on
account
of
his
hook
that
he
had
always
followed
the
sea
that
lately
he
had
coasted
the
west
shores
of
mexico
that
at
guaymas
he
had
fallen
in
with
spanish
friends
in
company
with
whom
he
had
visited
the
mines
in
the
sierra
madre
that
on
this
expedition
the
party
had
been
attacked
by
yaquis
and
wiped
out
he
alone
surviving
that
his
before
expiring
had
told
him
of
gold
buried
in
a
cove
of
lower
california
by
the
man
grandfather
that
the
man
had
given
him
a
chart
showing
the
location
of
the
treasure
that
he
had
sewn
this
chart
in
the
shoulder
of
his
coat
whence
his
suspicion
of
me
and
his
being
so
loco
about
getting
it
back
and
it
a
big
thing
said
handy
solomon
to
me
for
they
not
only
gold
but
altar
jewels
and
diamonds
it
will
make
us
rich
and
a
dozen
like
us
and
you
can
kiss
the
book
on
that
that
may
all
be
true
said
i
but
why
do
you
tell
me
why
do
you
get
your
treasure
without
the
need
of
dividing
it
why
mate
he
answered
it
just
plain
gratitude
did
you
save
my
life
and
nuss
me
and
take
care
of
me
when
i
was
nigh
killed
look
here
anderson
or
handy
solomon
or
whatever
you
please
to
call
yourself
i
rejoined
to
this
if
you
going
to
do
business
with
me
and
i
do
not
understand
yet
just
what
it
is
you
want
of
me
have
to
talk
straight
it
all
very
well
to
say
gratitude
but
that
do
go
with
me
you
been
around
here
three
months
and
barring
a
civil
words
and
twice
as
many
of
the
other
kind
i
failed
to
see
any
indications
of
your
gratitude
before
it
a
quality
with
a
hell
of
a
to
it
he
looked
at
me
sideways
spat
and
looked
at
me
sideways
again
then
he
burst
into
a
laugh
the
devil
a
preacher
if
you
ai
lost
your
pinfeathers
said
he
well
it
this
then
i
got
to
have
a
boat
to
get
there
and
she
must
be
stocked
and
i
got
to
have
help
with
the
treasure
if
it
like
this
fellow
said
it
was
and
the
yaquis
and
cannibals
from
tiburon
is
through
the
country
it
money
i
got
to
have
and
it
money
i
have
got
and
ca
get
unless
i
let
somebody
in
as
pardner
why
me
i
asked
why
not
he
retorted
i
ai
see
anybody
i
like
better
we
talked
the
matter
over
at
length
i
had
to
force
him
to
each
point
for
suspicion
was
strong
in
him
i
stood
out
for
a
larger
party
he
strongly
opposed
this
as
depreciating
the
shares
but
i
had
no
intention
of
going
alone
into
what
was
then
considered
a
wild
and
dangerous
country
finally
we
compromised
a
third
of
the
treasure
was
to
go
to
him
a
third
to
me
and
the
rest
was
to
be
divided
among
the
men
whom
i
should
select
this
scheme
did
not
appeal
to
him
how
do
i
know
you
plays
fair
he
complained
they
be
four
of
you
to
one
of
me
and
i
do
like
it
and
you
can
kiss
the
book
on
that
if
you
do
like
it
leave
it
said
i
and
get
out
and
be
damned
to
you
finally
he
agreed
but
he
refused
me
a
look
at
the
chart
saying
that
he
had
left
it
in
a
safe
place
i
believe
in
reality
he
wanted
to
be
surer
of
me
and
for
that
i
can
hardly
blame
him
chapter
twelve
the
murder
on
the
beach
at
this
moment
the
cook
stuck
his
head
in
at
the
open
door
say
you
fellows
he
complained
i
got
to
be
up
at
three
ai
you
never
going
to
turn
in
shut
up
doctor
somebody
kill
him
here
sit
down
and
listen
to
this
yarn
yelled
a
savage
chorus
there
ensued
a
slight
scuffle
a
few
objections
then
silence
and
the
stranger
took
up
his
story
i
had
a
chum
named
billy
simpson
and
i
rung
him
in
for
friendship
then
there
was
a
solemn
tall
texas
young
fellow
strong
as
a
bull
straight
and
tough
brought
up
fighting
injins
he
never
said
much
but
i
knew
he
be
right
there
when
the
gong
struck
for
fourth
man
i
picked
out
a
german
named
schwartz
he
and
simpson
had
just
come
back
from
the
mines
together
i
took
him
because
he
was
a
friend
of
billy
and
besides
was
young
and
strong
and
was
the
only
man
in
town
excepting
the
sailor
anderson
who
knew
anything
about
running
a
boat
i
forgot
to
say
that
the
texas
fellow
was
named
denton
handy
solomon
had
his
boat
all
picked
out
it
belonged
to
some
basques
who
had
sailed
her
around
from
california
i
must
say
when
i
saw
her
i
felt
inclined
to
renig
for
she
was
about
feet
long
was
open
except
for
a
little
sort
of
cubbyhole
up
in
the
front
of
her
had
one
mast
and
was
pointed
at
both
ends
however
schwartz
said
she
was
all
right
he
claimed
he
knew
the
kind
that
she
was
the
sort
used
by
french
fishermen
and
could
stand
all
sorts
of
trouble
she
did
look
it
we
worked
her
up
to
yuma
partly
with
oars
and
partly
by
sails
then
we
loaded
her
with
grub
for
a
month
each
of
us
had
his
own
weapons
of
course
in
addition
we
put
in
picks
and
shovels
and
a
small
cask
of
water
handy
solomon
said
that
would
be
enough
as
there
was
water
marked
down
on
his
chart
we
told
the
gang
that
we
were
going
trading
at
the
end
of
the
week
we
started
and
were
out
four
days
there
was
much
room
what
with
the
supplies
and
the
baggage
for
the
five
of
us
we
had
to
curl
up
anywheres
to
sleep
and
it
certainly
seemed
to
me
that
we
were
in
lots
of
danger
the
waves
were
much
bigger
than
she
was
and
splashed
on
us
considerable
but
schwartz
and
anderson
did
seem
to
mind
they
laughed
at
us
anderson
sang
that
song
of
his
and
schwartz
told
us
of
the
placers
he
had
worked
he
and
simpson
had
made
a
pretty
good
just
enough
to
make
them
want
to
get
rich
the
first
day
out
simpson
showed
us
a
belt
with
about
an
hundred
ounces
of
dust
this
he
got
tired
of
wearing
so
he
kept
it
in
a
which
was
empty
at
the
end
of
the
four
days
we
turned
in
at
a
deep
bay
and
came
to
anchor
the
country
was
the
usual
proposition
very
mountains
about
two
thousand
feet
high
lots
of
sage
and
cactus
a
pebbly
beach
and
not
a
sign
of
anything
fresh
and
green
but
denton
and
i
were
mighty
glad
to
see
any
sort
of
land
besides
our
keg
of
water
was
pretty
low
and
it
was
getting
about
time
to
discover
the
spring
the
chart
spoke
of
so
we
piled
our
camp
stuff
in
the
small
boat
and
rowed
ashore
anderson
led
the
way
confidently
enough
up
a
dry
arroyo
whose
sides
were
clay
and
conglomerate
but
though
we
followed
it
to
the
end
we
could
find
no
indications
that
it
was
anything
more
than
a
wash
for
rain
floods
that
main
queer
muttered
anderson
and
returned
to
the
beach
there
he
spread
out
the
chart
the
first
look
at
it
we
had
and
set
to
studying
it
it
was
a
careful
piece
of
work
done
in
india
ink
pretty
old
to
judge
by
the
look
of
it
and
with
all
sorts
of
pictures
of
mountains
and
dolphins
and
ships
and
anchors
around
the
edge
there
was
our
bay
all
right
two
crosses
were
marked
on
the
land
part
one
labelled
oro
and
the
other
agua
now
there
the
high
cliff
says
anderson
following
it
out
and
there
the
round
hill
with
the
boulder
and
if
them
bearings
point
due
for
that
ravine
the
devil
a
preacher
we
tried
it
again
with
the
same
result
a
second
inspection
of
the
map
brought
us
no
light
on
the
question
we
talked
it
over
and
looked
at
it
from
all
points
but
we
could
dodge
the
truth
the
chart
was
wrong
then
we
explored
several
of
the
nearest
gullies
but
without
finding
anything
but
loose
stones
baked
hot
in
the
sun
by
now
it
was
getting
towards
sundown
so
we
built
us
a
fire
of
mesquite
on
the
beach
made
us
supper
and
boiled
a
pot
of
beans
we
talked
it
over
the
water
was
about
gone
that
what
we
got
to
find
first
said
simpson
no
question
of
it
it
god
knows
how
far
to
the
next
water
and
we
do
know
how
long
it
will
take
us
to
get
there
in
that
little
boat
if
we
run
our
water
entirely
out
before
we
start
we
going
to
be
in
trouble
we
have
a
good
look
and
if
we
do
find
her
we
run
down
to
mollyhay
and
get
a
few
extra
casks
perhaps
that
map
is
wrong
about
the
treasure
too
suggested
denton
i
thought
of
that
said
handy
solomon
but
then
thinks
i
to
myself
this
old
rip
probably
do
make
no
long
stay
here
just
dodges
in
and
out
like
between
tides
to
bury
his
loot
he
would
need
no
water
at
the
time
but
he
might
when
he
came
back
so
he
marked
the
water
on
his
map
but
he
was
noways
particular
and
exact
being
in
a
hurry
but
you
can
kiss
the
book
to
it
that
he
did
make
no
such
mistakes
about
the
swag
i
believe
you
right
said
i
when
we
came
to
turn
in
anderson
suggested
that
he
should
sleep
aboard
the
boat
but
billy
simpson
in
mind
perhaps
of
the
hundred
ounces
in
the
insisted
that
he
just
as
soon
as
not
after
a
little
objection
handy
solomon
gave
in
but
i
thought
he
seemed
sour
about
it
we
built
a
good
fire
and
in
about
ten
seconds
were
asleep
now
usually
i
sleep
like
a
log
and
did
this
time
until
about
midnight
then
all
at
once
i
came
broad
awake
and
sitting
up
in
my
blankets
nothing
had
happened
i
was
even
dreaming
but
there
i
was
as
alert
and
clear
as
though
it
were
broad
noon
by
the
light
of
the
fire
i
saw
handy
solomon
sitting
and
at
his
side
our
five
rifles
gathered
i
must
have
made
some
noise
for
he
turned
quietly
toward
me
saw
i
was
awake
and
nodded
the
moonlight
was
sparkling
on
the
hard
stony
landscape
and
a
thin
dampness
came
out
from
the
sea
after
a
minute
anderson
threw
on
another
stick
of
wood
yawned
and
stood
up
it
wet
said
he
i
been
fixing
the
guns
he
showed
me
how
he
was
inserting
a
little
patch
of
felt
between
the
hammer
and
the
nipple
a
scheme
of
his
own
for
keeping
damp
from
the
powder
then
he
rolled
up
in
his
blanket
at
the
time
it
all
seemed
quite
natural
i
suppose
my
mind
was
fully
awake
for
all
my
head
felt
so
clear
afterwards
i
realised
what
a
ridiculous
bluff
he
was
making
for
of
course
the
cap
already
on
the
nipple
was
plenty
to
keep
out
the
damp
i
fully
believe
he
intended
to
kill
us
as
we
lay
only
my
sudden
awakening
spoiled
his
plan
i
had
absolutely
no
idea
of
this
at
the
time
however
not
the
slightest
suspicion
entered
my
head
in
view
of
that
fact
i
have
since
believed
in
guardian
angels
for
my
next
move
which
at
the
time
seemed
to
me
absolutely
aimless
was
to
change
my
blankets
from
one
side
of
the
fire
to
the
other
and
that
brought
me
alongside
the
five
rifles
owing
to
this
fact
i
am
now
convinced
we
awoke
safe
at
daylight
cooked
breakfast
and
laid
the
plan
for
the
day
anderson
directed
us
i
was
to
climb
over
the
ridge
before
us
and
search
in
the
ravine
on
the
other
side
schwartz
was
to
explore
up
the
beach
to
the
left
and
denton
to
the
right
anderson
said
he
would
wait
for
billy
simpson
who
had
overslept
in
the
darkness
of
the
cubbyhole
and
who
was
now
paddling
ashore
the
two
of
them
would
push
inland
to
the
west
until
a
high
hill
would
give
them
a
chance
to
look
around
for
greenery
we
started
at
once
before
the
sun
would
be
hot
the
hill
i
had
to
climb
was
steep
and
covered
with
chollas
so
i
did
get
along
very
fast
when
i
was
about
half
way
to
the
top
i
heard
a
shot
from
the
beach
i
looked
back
anderson
was
in
the
small
boat
rowing
rapidly
out
to
the
vessel
denton
was
running
up
the
beach
from
one
direction
and
schwartz
from
the
other
i
slid
and
slipped
down
the
bluff
getting
pretty
well
stuck
up
with
the
cholla
spines
at
the
beach
we
found
billy
simpson
lying
on
his
ace
shot
through
the
back
we
turned
him
over
but
he
was
apparently
dead
anderson
had
hoisted
the
sail
had
cut
loose
from
the
anchor
and
was
sailing
away
denton
stood
up
straight
and
tall
looking
then
he
pulled
his
belt
in
a
hole
grabbed
my
arm
and
started
to
run
up
the
long
curve
of
the
beach
behind
us
came
schwartz
we
ran
near
a
mile
and
then
fell
among
some
tules
in
an
inlet
at
the
farther
point
what
is
it
i
gasped
our
only
chance
to
get
him
said
denton
he
got
to
go
around
this
point
big
wind
perhaps
his
mast
will
bust
then
he
come
ashore
he
opened
and
shut
his
big
brown
hands
so
there
we
two
fools
lay
like
panthers
in
the
tules
taking
our
only
chance
to
lay
hands
on
anderson
any
sailor
could
have
told
us
that
the
mast
would
break
but
we
had
winded
schwartz
a
quarter
of
a
mile
back
and
so
we
waited
our
eyes
fixed
on
the
sail
grudging
her
every
inch
just
burning
to
fix
things
to
suit
us
a
little
better
and
naturally
she
made
the
point
in
what
i
now
know
was
only
a
fresh
breeze
squared
away
and
dropped
down
before
the
wind
toward
guaymas
we
walked
back
slowly
to
our
camp
swallowing
the
copper
taste
of
too
hard
a
run
schwartz
we
picked
up
from
a
boulder
just
recovering
we
were
all
of
us
crazy
mad
schwartz
half
wept
and
blamed
and
cussed
denton
glowered
away
in
silence
i
ground
my
feet
into
the
sand
in
a
help
less
sort
of
anger
not
only
at
the
man
himself
but
also
at
the
whole
way
things
had
turned
out
i
do
believe
the
least
notion
of
our
predicament
had
come
to
any
of
us
all
we
knew
yet
was
that
we
had
been
done
up
and
we
were
hostile
about
it
but
at
camp
we
found
something
to
occupy
us
for
the
moment
poor
billy
was
not
dead
as
we
had
supposed
but
very
weak
and
sick
and
a
hole
square
through
him
when
we
returned
he
was
conscious
but
that
was
about
all
his
eyes
were
shut
and
he
was
moaning
i
tore
open
his
shirt
to
stanch
the
blood
he
felt
my
hand
and
opened
his
eyes
they
were
glazed
and
i
do
think
he
saw
me
water
water
he
cried
at
that
we
others
saw
all
at
once
where
we
stood
i
remember
i
rose
to
my
feet
and
found
myself
staring
straight
into
tom
denton
eyes
we
looked
at
each
other
that
way
for
i
guess
it
was
a
full
minute
then
tom
shook
his
head
water
water
begged
poor
billy
tom
leaned
over
him
my
god
billy
there
ai
any
water
said
he
mulege
i
retain
the
old
timer
pronunciation
chapter
thirteen
buried
treasure
the
old
timer
voice
broke
a
little
we
had
leisure
to
notice
that
even
the
drip
from
the
eaves
had
ceased
a
faint
diffused
light
vouchsafed
us
dim
outlines
of
sprawling
figures
and
tumbled
bedding
far
in
the
distance
outside
a
wolf
yelped
we
could
do
nothing
for
him
except
shelter
him
from
the
sun
and
wet
his
forehead
with
nor
could
we
think
clearly
for
ourselves
as
long
as
the
spark
of
life
lingered
in
him
his
chest
rose
and
fell
regularly
but
with
long
pauses
between
when
the
sun
was
overhead
he
suddenly
opened
his
eyes
fellows
said
he
it
beautiful
over
there
the
grass
is
so
green
and
the
water
so
cool
i
am
tired
of
marching
and
i
reckon
i
cross
over
and
camp
then
he
died
we
scooped
out
a
shallow
hole
above
and
laid
him
in
it
and
piled
over
him
stones
from
the
then
we
went
back
to
the
beach
very
solemn
to
talk
it
over
now
boys
said
i
there
seems
to
me
just
one
thing
to
do
and
that
is
to
pike
out
for
water
as
fast
as
we
can
where
asked
denton
well
i
argued
i
do
believe
there
any
water
about
this
bay
maybe
there
was
when
that
chart
was
made
it
was
a
long
time
ago
and
any
way
the
old
pirate
was
a
sailor
and
no
plainsman
and
maybe
he
mistook
rainwater
for
a
spring
we
looked
around
this
end
of
the
bay
the
chances
are
we
use
up
two
or
three
days
exploring
around
the
other
and
then
would
be
as
well
off
as
we
are
right
now
which
way
asked
denton
again
mighty
brief
well
said
i
there
one
thing
i
always
noticed
in
case
of
folks
held
up
by
the
desert
they
generally
go
wandering
about
here
and
there
looking
for
water
until
they
die
not
far
from
where
they
got
lost
and
usually
they
covered
a
heap
of
actual
distance
that
so
agreed
denton
now
i
always
figured
that
it
would
be
a
good
deal
better
to
start
right
out
for
some
particular
place
even
if
it
ten
thousand
miles
away
a
man
is
just
as
likely
to
strike
water
going
in
a
straight
line
as
he
is
going
in
a
circle
and
then
besides
he
getting
somewhere
correct
said
denton
so
i
finished
i
reckon
we
better
follow
the
coast
south
and
try
to
get
to
mollyhay
how
far
is
that
asked
schwartz
i
do
rightly
know
but
somewheres
between
three
and
five
hundred
miles
at
a
guess
at
that
he
fell
to
glowering
and
grooming
with
himself
brooding
over
what
a
hard
time
it
was
going
to
be
that
is
the
way
with
a
german
first
off
he
plumb
scared
at
the
prospect
of
suffering
anything
and
would
rather
die
right
off
than
take
long
chances
after
he
gets
into
the
swing
of
it
he
behaves
as
well
as
any
man
we
took
stock
of
what
we
had
to
depend
on
the
total
assets
proved
to
be
just
three
pairs
of
legs
a
pot
of
coffee
had
been
on
the
fire
but
that
villain
had
kicked
it
over
when
he
left
the
kettle
of
beans
was
there
but
somehow
we
got
the
notion
they
might
have
been
poisoned
so
we
left
them
i
do
know
now
why
we
were
so
foolish
if
poison
was
his
game
he
have
tried
it
before
but
at
that
time
it
seemed
reasonable
enough
perhaps
the
horror
of
the
morning
work
and
the
sight
of
the
mountains
and
the
ghastly
yellow
glare
of
the
sun
and
the
blue
waves
racing
by
outside
and
the
big
strong
wind
that
blew
through
us
so
hard
that
it
seemed
to
blow
empty
our
souls
had
turned
our
judgment
anyway
we
left
a
full
meal
there
in
the
beanpot
so
without
any
further
delay
we
set
off
up
the
ridge
i
had
started
to
cross
that
morning
schwartz
lagged
sulky
as
a
muley
cow
but
we
managed
to
keep
him
with
us
at
the
top
of
the
ridge
we
took
our
bearings
for
the
next
deep
bay
already
we
had
made
up
our
minds
to
stick
to
the
both
on
account
of
the
lower
country
over
which
to
travel
and
the
off
chance
of
falling
in
with
a
fishing
vessel
schwartz
muttered
something
about
its
being
too
far
even
to
the
next
bay
and
wanted
to
sit
down
on
a
rock
denton
did
say
anything
but
he
jerked
schwartz
up
by
the
collar
so
fiercely
that
the
german
gave
it
over
and
came
along
we
dropped
down
into
the
gully
stumbled
over
the
boulder
wash
and
began
to
toil
in
the
sand
of
a
little
flat
this
side
of
the
next
ascent
schwartz
followed
steadily
enough
now
but
had
fallen
forty
or
fifty
feet
behind
this
was
a
nuisance
as
we
bad
to
keep
turning
to
see
if
he
still
kept
up
suddenly
he
seemed
to
disappear
denton
and
i
hurried
back
to
find
him
on
his
hands
and
knees
behind
a
sagebrush
clawing
away
at
the
sand
like
mad
ca
be
water
on
this
flat
said
denton
he
must
have
gone
crazy
what
the
matter
schwartz
i
asked
for
answer
he
moved
a
little
to
one
side
showing
beneath
his
knee
one
corner
of
a
wooden
box
sticking
above
the
sand
at
this
we
dropped
beside
him
and
in
five
minutes
had
uncovered
the
whole
of
the
chest
it
was
not
very
large
and
was
locked
a
rock
from
the
wash
fixed
that
however
we
threw
back
the
lid
it
was
full
to
the
brim
of
gold
coins
thrown
in
loose
nigh
two
bushels
of
them
the
treasure
i
cried
there
it
was
sure
enough
or
some
of
it
we
looked
the
rest
through
but
found
nothing
but
the
gold
coins
the
altar
ornaments
and
jewels
were
lacking
probably
buried
in
another
box
or
so
said
denton
schwartz
wanted
to
dig
around
a
little
no
good
said
i
we
got
our
work
cut
out
for
us
as
it
is
denton
backed
me
up
we
were
both
old
hands
at
the
business
had
each
in
our
time
suffered
the
thirst
and
the
memory
of
it
outweighed
any
desire
for
treasure
but
schwartz
was
left
to
himself
he
would
have
staid
on
that
sand
flat
to
perish
as
certainly
as
had
poor
billy
we
had
fairly
to
force
him
away
and
then
succeeded
only
because
we
let
him
fill
all
his
pockets
to
bulging
with
the
coins
as
we
moved
up
the
next
rise
he
kept
looking
back
and
uttering
little
moans
against
the
crime
of
leaving
it
luckily
for
us
it
was
winter
we
should
have
lasted
six
hours
at
this
time
of
year
as
it
was
the
sun
was
hot
against
the
shale
and
the
little
stones
of
those
cussed
hills
we
plodded
along
until
late
afternoon
toiling
up
one
hill
and
down
another
only
to
repeat
immediately
towards
sundown
we
made
the
second
bay
where
we
plunged
into
the
sea
clothes
and
all
and
were
greatly
refreshed
i
suppose
a
man
absorbs
a
good
deal
that
way
anyhow
it
always
seemed
to
help
we
were
now
pretty
hungry
and
as
we
walked
along
the
shore
we
began
to
look
for
turtles
or
shellfish
or
anything
else
that
might
come
handy
there
was
nothing
schwartz
wanted
to
stop
for
a
night
rest
but
denton
and
i
knew
better
than
that
look
here
schwartz
said
denton
you
do
realise
you
entered
against
time
in
this
race
and
that
you
a
damn
fool
to
carry
all
that
weight
in
your
clothes
so
we
dragged
along
all
night
it
was
weird
enough
i
can
tell
you
the
moon
shone
cold
and
white
over
that
dead
dry
country
hot
whiffs
rose
from
the
baked
stones
and
hillsides
shadows
lay
under
the
stones
like
animals
crouching
when
we
came
to
the
edge
of
a
silvery
hill
we
dropped
off
into
pitchy
blackness
there
we
stumbled
over
boulders
for
a
minute
or
so
and
began
to
climb
the
steep
shale
on
the
other
side
this
was
fearful
work
the
top
seemed
always
miles
away
by
morning
we
did
seem
to
have
made
much
of
anywhere
the
same
old
mountains
with
the
sharp
edges
stuck
up
in
about
the
same
old
places
we
had
got
over
being
very
hungry
and
though
we
were
pretty
dry
we
did
really
suffer
yet
from
thirst
about
this
time
denton
ran
across
some
fishhook
cactus
which
we
cut
up
and
chewed
they
have
a
sticky
wet
sort
of
inside
which
does
quench
your
thirst
any
but
helps
to
keep
you
from
drying
up
and
blowing
away
all
that
day
we
plugged
along
as
per
usual
it
was
main
hard
work
and
we
got
to
that
state
where
things
are
disagreeable
but
mechanical
strange
to
say
schwartz
kept
in
the
lead
it
seemed
to
me
at
the
time
that
he
was
using
more
energy
than
the
occasion
called
for
just
as
man
runs
faster
before
he
comes
to
the
point
however
the
hours
went
by
and
he
did
seem
to
get
any
more
tired
than
the
rest
of
us
we
kept
a
sharp
lookout
for
anything
to
eat
but
there
was
nothing
but
lizards
and
horned
toads
later
we
have
been
glad
of
them
but
by
that
time
we
got
out
of
their
district
night
came
just
at
sundown
we
took
another
wallow
in
the
surf
and
chewed
some
more
fishhook
cactus
when
the
moon
came
up
we
went
on
i
not
going
to
tell
you
how
dead
beat
we
got
we
were
pretty
tough
and
strong
for
all
of
us
had
been
used
to
hard
living
but
after
the
third
day
without
anything
to
eat
and
no
water
to
drink
it
came
to
be
pretty
hard
going
it
got
to
the
point
where
we
had
to
have
some
reason
for
getting
out
besides
just
keeping
alive
a
man
would
sometimes
rather
die
than
keep
alive
anyway
if
it
came
only
to
that
but
i
know
i
made
up
my
mind
i
was
going
to
get
out
so
i
could
smash
up
that
anderson
and
i
reckon
denton
had
the
same
idea
schwartz
say
anything
but
he
pumped
on
ahead
of
us
his
back
bent
over
and
his
clothes
sagging
and
bulging
with
the
gold
he
carried
we
used
to
travel
all
night
because
it
was
cool
and
rest
an
hour
or
two
at
noon
that
is
all
the
rest
we
did
get
i
do
know
how
fast
we
went
i
got
beyond
that
we
must
have
crawled
along
mighty
slow
though
after
our
first
strength
gave
out
the
way
i
used
to
do
was
to
collect
myself
with
an
effort
look
around
for
my
bearings
pick
out
a
landmark
a
little
distance
off
and
forget
everything
but
it
then
plod
along
knowing
nothing
but
the
sand
and
shale
and
slope
under
my
feet
until
i
reached
that
landmark
then
i
clear
my
mind
and
pick
out
another
but
i
could
shut
out
the
figure
of
schwartz
that
way
he
used
to
walk
along
just
ahead
of
my
shoulder
his
face
was
all
twisted
up
but
i
remember
thinking
at
the
time
it
looked
more
as
if
he
was
worried
in
his
mind
than
like
bodily
suffering
the
weight
of
the
gold
in
his
clothes
bent
his
shoulders
over
as
we
went
on
the
country
gradually
got
to
be
more
mountainous
and
as
we
were
steadily
growing
weaker
it
did
seem
things
were
piling
up
on
us
the
eighth
day
we
ran
out
of
the
fishhook
cactus
and
being
on
a
high
promontory
were
out
of
touch
with
the
sea
for
the
first
time
my
tongue
began
to
swell
a
little
the
cactus
had
kept
me
from
that
before
denton
must
have
been
in
the
same
fix
for
he
looked
at
me
and
raised
one
eyebrow
kind
of
humorous
schwartz
was
having
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
to
navigate
i
will
say
for
him
that
he
had
done
well
but
now
i
could
see
that
his
strength
was
going
on
him
in
spite
of
himself
he
knew
it
all
right
for
when
we
rested
that
day
he
took
all
the
gold
coins
and
spread
them
in
a
row
and
counted
them
and
put
them
back
in
his
pocket
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
snatched
out
two
handfuls
and
threw
them
as
far
as
he
could
too
heavy
he
muttered
but
that
was
all
he
could
bring
himself
to
throw
away
all
that
night
we
wandered
high
in
the
air
i
guess
we
tried
to
keep
a
general
direction
but
i
do
know
anyway
along
late
but
before
moonrise
she
was
now
on
the
wane
i
came
to
and
found
myself
looking
over
the
edge
of
a
drop
right
below
me
i
made
out
a
faint
glimmer
of
white
earth
in
the
starlight
somehow
it
reminded
me
of
a
little
trail
i
used
to
know
under
a
big
rock
back
in
texas
here
a
trail
i
thought
more
than
half
loco
i
follow
it
at
least
that
what
half
of
me
thought
the
other
half
was
sensible
and
knew
better
but
it
seemed
to
be
kind
of
standing
to
one
side
a
little
scornful
watching
the
performance
so
i
slid
and
slipped
down
to
the
strip
of
white
earth
and
sure
enough
it
was
a
trail
at
that
the
loco
half
of
me
gave
the
sensible
part
the
laugh
i
followed
the
path
twenty
feet
and
came
to
a
dark
hollow
under
the
rock
and
in
it
a
round
pool
of
water
about
a
foot
across
they
say
a
man
kills
himself
drinking
too
much
after
starving
for
water
that
may
be
but
it
did
kill
me
and
i
sucked
up
all
i
could
hold
perhaps
the
fishhook
cactus
had
helped
well
sir
it
was
surprising
how
that
drink
brought
me
around
a
minute
before
i
been
on
the
edge
of
going
plumb
loco
and
here
i
was
as
as
a
lawyer
i
hunted
up
denton
and
schwartz
they
drank
themselves
full
too
then
we
rested
it
was
mighty
hard
to
leave
that
spring
oh
we
had
to
do
it
we
have
starved
sure
there
the
trail
was
a
game
trail
but
that
did
us
no
good
for
we
had
no
weapons
how
we
did
wish
for
the
coffeepot
so
we
could
take
some
away
we
filled
our
hats
and
carried
them
about
three
hours
before
the
water
began
to
soak
through
then
we
had
to
drink
it
in
order
to
save
it
the
country
fairly
stood
up
on
end
we
had
to
climb
separate
little
hills
so
as
to
avoid
rolling
rocks
down
on
each
other
it
took
it
out
of
us
about
this
time
we
began
to
see
mountain
sheep
they
would
come
right
up
to
the
edges
of
the
small
cliffs
to
look
at
us
we
threw
stones
at
them
hoping
to
hit
one
in
the
forehead
but
of
course
without
any
results
the
good
effects
of
the
water
lasted
us
about
a
day
then
we
began
to
see
things
again
off
and
on
i
could
see
water
plain
as
could
be
in
every
hollow
and
game
of
all
kinds
standing
around
and
looking
at
me
i
knew
these
were
all
fakes
by
making
an
effort
i
could
swing
things
around
to
where
they
belonged
i
used
to
do
that
every
once
in
a
while
just
to
be
sure
we
were
doubling
back
and
to
look
out
for
real
water
but
most
of
the
time
it
did
seem
to
be
worth
while
i
just
let
all
these
visions
riot
around
and
have
a
good
time
inside
me
or
outside
me
whichever
it
was
i
knew
i
could
get
rid
of
them
any
minute
most
of
the
time
if
i
was
in
any
doubt
it
was
easier
to
throw
a
stone
to
see
if
the
animals
were
real
or
not
the
real
ones
ran
away
we
began
to
see
bands
of
wild
horses
in
the
uplands
one
day
both
denton
and
i
plainly
saw
one
with
saddle
marks
on
him
if
only
one
of
us
had
seen
him
it
would
have
counted
much
but
we
both
made
him
out
this
encouraged
us
wonderfully
though
i
do
see
why
it
should
have
we
had
topped
the
high
country
too
and
had
started
down
the
other
side
of
the
mountains
that
ran
out
on
the
promontory
denton
and
i
were
still
navigating
without
any
thought
of
giving
up
but
schwartz
was
getting
in
bad
shape
i
hate
to
pack
twenty
pounds
over
that
country
even
with
rest
food
and
water
he
was
toting
it
on
nothing
we
told
him
so
and
he
came
to
see
it
but
he
never
could
persuade
himself
to
get
rid
of
the
gold
all
at
once
instead
he
threw
away
the
pieces
one
by
one
each
sacrifice
seemed
to
nerve
him
up
for
another
heat
i
can
shut
my
eyes
and
see
it
now
the
wide
glaring
yellow
country
the
pasteboard
mountains
we
three
dragging
along
and
the
fierce
sunshine
flashing
from
the
doubloons
as
one
by
one
they
went
spinning
through
the
air
chapter
fourteen
the
chewed
sugar
cane
i
like
to
have
trailed
you
fellows
sighed
a
voice
from
the
corner
would
you
said
colorado
rogers
grimly
it
was
five
days
to
the
next
water
but
they
were
worse
than
the
eight
days
before
we
were
lucky
however
for
at
the
spring
we
discovered
in
a
deep
wash
near
the
coast
was
the
skull
of
a
horse
it
had
been
there
a
long
time
but
a
few
shreds
of
dried
flesh
still
clung
to
it
it
was
the
only
thing
that
could
be
described
as
food
that
had
passed
our
lips
since
breakfast
thirteen
days
before
in
that
time
we
had
crossed
the
mountain
chain
and
had
come
again
to
the
sea
the
lord
was
good
to
us
he
sent
us
the
water
and
the
horse
skull
and
the
smooth
hard
beach
without
breaks
or
the
necessity
of
climbing
hills
and
we
needed
it
oh
i
promise
you
we
needed
it
i
doubt
if
any
of
us
could
have
kept
the
direction
except
by
such
an
obvious
and
continuous
landmark
as
the
sea
to
our
left
it
hardly
seemed
worth
while
to
focus
my
mind
but
i
did
it
occasionally
just
by
way
of
testing
myself
schwartz
still
threw
away
his
gold
coins
and
once
in
one
of
my
rare
intervals
of
looking
about
me
i
saw
denton
picking
them
up
this
surprised
me
mildly
but
i
was
too
tired
to
be
very
curious
only
now
when
i
saw
schwartz
arm
sweep
out
in
what
had
become
a
mechanical
movement
i
always
took
pains
to
look
and
always
i
saw
denton
search
for
the
coin
sometimes
he
found
it
and
sometimes
he
did
not
the
figures
of
my
companions
and
the
tide
sand
under
my
feet
and
a
consciousness
of
the
blue
and
white
sea
to
my
left
are
all
i
remember
except
when
we
had
to
pull
ourselves
together
for
the
purpose
of
cutting
fishhook
cactus
i
kept
going
and
i
knew
i
had
a
good
reason
for
doing
so
but
it
seemed
too
much
of
an
effort
to
recall
what
that
reason
was
schwartz
threw
away
a
gold
piece
as
another
man
would
take
a
stimulant
gradually
without
really
thinking
about
it
i
came
to
see
this
and
then
went
on
to
sabe
why
denton
picked
up
the
coins
and
a
great
admiration
for
denton
cleverness
seeped
through
me
like
water
through
the
sand
he
was
saving
the
coins
to
keep
schwartz
going
when
the
last
coin
went
schwartz
would
give
out
it
all
sounds
queer
now
but
it
seemed
all
right
then
and
it
was
all
right
too
so
we
walked
on
the
beach
losing
entire
track
of
time
and
after
a
long
interval
i
came
to
myself
to
see
schwartz
lying
on
the
sand
and
denton
standing
over
him
of
course
we
all
been
falling
down
a
lot
but
always
before
we
got
up
again
he
give
out
croaked
denton
his
voice
sounded
as
if
it
was
miles
away
which
surprised
me
but
when
i
answered
mine
sounded
miles
away
too
which
surprised
me
still
more
denton
pulled
out
a
handful
of
gold
coins
this
will
buy
him
some
more
walk
said
he
gravely
but
not
much
i
nodded
it
seemed
all
right
this
new
strange
purchasing
power
of
gold
it
was
all
right
by
god
and
as
real
as
buying
bricks
i
go
on
said
denton
and
send
back
help
you
come
after
to
mollyhay
said
i
this
far
i
reckon
we
hung
onto
ourselves
because
it
was
serious
now
i
began
to
laugh
so
did
denton
we
laughed
and
laughed
a
damn
long
way
to
mollyhay
said
i
then
we
laughed
some
more
until
the
tears
ran
down
our
cheeks
and
we
had
to
hold
our
poor
weak
sides
pretty
soon
we
fetched
up
with
a
gasp
a
damn
long
way
to
mollyhay
whispered
denton
and
then
off
we
went
into
more
shrieks
and
when
we
would
sober
down
a
little
one
or
the
other
of
us
would
say
it
again
a
damn
long
way
to
mollyhay
and
then
we
laugh
some
more
it
must
have
been
a
sweet
sight
at
last
i
realised
that
we
ought
to
pull
ourselves
together
so
i
snubbed
up
short
and
denton
did
the
same
and
we
set
to
laying
plans
but
every
minute
or
so
one
of
us
would
catch
on
some
word
and
then
we
trail
off
into
rhymes
and
laughter
and
repetition
keep
him
going
as
long
as
you
can
said
denton
yes
and
be
sure
to
stick
to
the
beach
that
far
it
was
all
right
and
but
the
word
beach
let
us
out
i
a
peach
upon
the
beach
sings
i
and
there
we
were
both
off
again
until
one
or
the
other
managed
to
grope
his
way
back
to
common
sense
again
and
sometimes
we
solemnly
around
and
around
the
prostrate
schwartz
like
a
pair
of
injins
but
somehow
we
got
our
plan
laid
at
last
slipped
the
coins
into
schwartz
pocket
and
said
old
socks
you
bet
i
try
yelled
denton
and
laughing
fit
to
kill
danced
off
up
the
beach
and
out
into
a
sort
of
grey
mist
that
shut
off
everything
beyond
a
certain
distance
from
me
now
so
i
kicked
schwartz
he
felt
in
his
pocket
threw
a
gold
piece
away
and
bought
a
little
more
walk
my
entire
vision
was
fifty
feet
or
so
across
beyond
that
was
grey
mist
inside
my
circle
i
could
see
the
sand
quite
plainly
and
footprints
if
i
moved
a
little
to
the
left
the
wash
of
the
waters
would
lap
under
the
edge
of
that
grey
curtain
if
i
moved
to
the
right
i
came
to
cliffs
the
nearer
i
drew
to
them
the
farther
up
i
could
see
but
i
could
never
see
to
the
top
it
used
to
amuse
me
to
move
this
area
of
consciousness
about
to
see
what
i
could
find
actual
physical
suffering
was
beginning
to
dull
and
my
head
seemed
to
be
getting
clearer
one
day
without
any
apparent
reason
i
moved
at
right
angles
across
the
beach
directly
before
me
lay
a
piece
of
sugar
cane
and
one
end
of
it
had
been
chewed
do
you
know
what
that
meant
animals
do
cut
sugar
cane
and
bring
it
to
the
beach
and
chew
one
end
a
new
strength
ran
through
me
and
actually
the
grey
mist
thinned
and
lifted
for
a
moment
until
i
could
make
out
dimly
the
line
of
cliffs
and
the
tumbling
sea
i
was
not
a
bit
hungry
but
i
chewed
on
the
sugar
cane
and
made
schwartz
do
the
same
when
we
went
on
i
kept
close
to
the
cliff
even
though
the
walking
was
somewhat
heavier
i
remember
after
that
its
getting
dark
and
then
light
again
so
the
night
must
have
passed
but
whether
we
rested
or
walked
i
do
not
know
probably
we
did
not
get
very
far
though
certainly
we
staggered
ahead
after
for
i
remember
my
shadow
about
midday
i
suppose
i
made
out
a
dim
trail
leading
up
a
break
in
the
cliffs
plenty
of
such
trails
we
had
seen
before
they
were
generally
made
by
peccaries
in
search
of
fish
i
hope
they
had
better
luck
than
we
but
in
the
middle
of
this
as
though
for
a
sign
lay
another
piece
of
chewed
sugar
cane
chapter
fifteen
the
calabash
stew
i
had
agreed
with
denton
to
stick
to
the
beach
but
schwartz
could
not
last
much
longer
and
i
had
not
the
slightest
idea
how
far
it
might
prove
to
be
to
mollyhay
so
i
turned
up
the
trail
we
climbed
a
mountain
ten
thousand
feet
high
i
mean
that
and
i
know
for
i
climbed
them
that
high
and
i
know
just
how
it
feels
and
how
many
times
you
have
to
rest
and
how
long
it
takes
and
how
much
it
knocks
out
of
you
those
are
the
things
that
count
in
measuring
height
and
so
i
tell
you
we
climbed
that
far
actually
i
suppose
the
hill
was
a
couple
of
hundred
feet
if
not
less
but
on
account
of
the
grey
mist
i
mentioned
i
could
not
see
the
top
and
the
illusion
was
complete
we
reached
the
summit
late
in
the
afternoon
for
the
sun
was
square
in
our
eyes
but
instead
of
blinding
me
it
seemed
to
clear
my
sight
so
that
i
saw
below
me
a
little
mud
hut
with
smoke
rising
behind
it
and
a
small
patch
of
cultivated
ground
i
pass
over
how
i
felt
about
it
they
have
made
the
words
well
we
stumbled
down
the
trail
and
into
the
hut
at
first
i
thought
it
was
empty
but
after
a
minute
i
saw
a
very
old
man
crouched
in
a
corner
as
i
looked
at
him
he
raised
his
bleared
eyes
to
me
his
head
swinging
slowly
from
side
to
side
as
though
with
a
kind
of
palsy
he
could
not
see
me
that
was
evident
nor
hear
me
but
some
instinct
not
yet
decayed
turned
him
toward
a
new
presence
in
the
room
in
my
wild
desire
for
water
i
found
room
to
think
that
here
was
a
man
even
worse
off
than
myself
a
vessel
of
water
was
in
the
corner
i
drank
it
it
was
more
than
i
could
hold
but
i
drank
even
after
i
was
filled
and
the
waste
ran
from
the
corners
of
my
mouth
i
had
forgotten
schwartz
the
excess
made
me
a
little
sick
but
i
held
down
what
i
had
swallowed
and
i
really
believe
it
soaked
into
my
system
as
it
does
into
the
desert
earth
after
a
drought
in
a
moment
or
so
i
took
the
vessel
and
filled
it
and
gave
it
to
schwartz
then
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
responsibility
had
ended
a
sudden
great
dreamy
lassitude
came
over
me
i
knew
i
needed
food
but
i
had
no
wish
for
it
and
no
ambition
to
search
it
out
the
man
in
the
corner
mumbled
at
me
with
his
toothless
gums
i
remember
wondering
if
we
were
all
to
starve
there
peacefully
together
schwartz
and
his
remaining
gold
coins
the
man
far
gone
in
years
and
myself
i
did
not
greatly
care
after
a
while
the
light
was
blotted
out
there
followed
a
slight
pause
then
i
knew
that
someone
had
flown
to
my
side
and
was
kneeling
beside
me
and
saying
liquid
pitying
things
in
mexican
i
swallowed
something
hot
and
strong
in
a
moment
i
came
back
from
wherever
i
was
drifting
to
look
up
at
a
mexican
girl
about
twenty
years
old
she
was
no
great
matter
in
looks
but
she
seemed
like
an
angel
to
me
then
and
she
had
sense
no
questions
no
nothing
just
business
the
only
thing
she
asked
of
me
was
if
i
understood
spanish
then
she
told
me
that
her
brother
would
be
back
soon
that
they
were
very
poor
that
she
was
sorry
she
had
no
meat
to
offer
me
that
they
were
very
poor
that
all
they
had
was
calabash
a
sort
of
squash
all
this
time
she
was
bustling
things
together
next
thing
i
know
i
had
a
big
bowl
of
calabash
stew
between
my
knees
now
strangely
enough
i
had
no
great
interest
in
that
calabash
stew
i
tasted
it
sat
and
thought
a
while
and
tasted
it
again
by
and
by
i
had
emptied
the
bowl
it
was
getting
dark
i
was
very
sleepy
a
man
came
in
but
i
was
too
drowsy
to
pay
any
attention
to
him
i
heard
the
sound
of
voices
then
i
was
picked
up
bodily
and
carried
to
an
and
laid
on
a
pile
of
skins
i
felt
the
weight
of
a
blanket
thrown
over
me
i
awoke
in
the
night
mind
you
i
had
practically
had
no
rest
at
all
for
a
matter
of
more
than
two
weeks
yet
i
woke
in
a
few
hours
and
remember
even
in
eating
the
calabash
stew
i
had
felt
no
hunger
in
spite
of
my
long
fast
but
now
i
found
myself
ravenous
you
boys
do
not
know
what
hunger
is
it
hurts
and
all
the
rest
of
that
night
i
lay
awake
chewing
on
the
rawhide
of
a
that
hung
near
me
next
morning
the
young
mexican
and
his
sister
came
to
us
early
bringing
more
calabash
stew
i
fell
on
it
like
a
wild
animal
and
just
wallowed
in
it
so
eager
was
i
to
eat
they
stood
and
watched
me
and
i
suppose
schwartz
too
though
i
had
now
lost
interest
in
anyone
but
myself
glancing
at
each
other
in
pity
from
time
to
time
when
i
had
finished
the
man
told
me
that
they
had
decided
to
kill
a
beef
so
we
could
have
meat
they
were
very
poor
but
god
had
brought
us
to
them
i
appreciated
this
afterward
at
the
time
i
merely
caught
at
the
word
meat
it
seemed
to
me
i
could
have
eaten
the
animal
entire
hide
hoofs
and
tallow
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
mighty
lucky
they
did
have
any
meat
if
they
had
we
probably
have
killed
ourselves
with
it
i
suppose
the
calabash
was
about
the
best
thing
for
us
under
the
circumstances
the
mexican
went
out
to
hunt
up
his
horse
i
called
the
girl
back
how
far
is
it
to
mollyhay
i
asked
her
a
league
said
she
so
we
had
been
near
our
journey
end
after
all
and
denton
was
probably
all
right
the
mexican
went
away
horseback
the
girl
fed
us
calabash
we
waited
about
one
a
group
of
horsemen
rode
over
the
hill
when
they
came
near
enough
i
recognised
denton
at
their
head
that
man
was
of
tempered
steel
they
had
followed
back
along
the
beach
caught
our
trail
where
we
had
turned
off
and
so
discovered
us
denton
had
fortunately
found
kind
and
intelligent
people
we
said
to
the
mexican
girl
i
made
schwartz
give
her
one
of
his
gold
pieces
but
denton
could
not
wait
for
us
to
say
hullo
even
he
was
so
anxious
to
get
back
to
town
so
we
mounted
the
horses
he
had
brought
us
and
rode
off
very
wobbly
we
lived
three
weeks
in
mollyhay
it
took
us
that
long
to
get
fed
up
the
lady
i
stayed
with
made
a
dish
of
kid
meat
and
stuffed
olives
why
an
hour
after
filling
myself
up
to
the
muzzle
i
be
hungry
again
and
scouting
round
to
houses
looking
for
more
to
eat
we
talked
things
over
a
good
deal
after
we
had
gained
a
little
strength
i
wanted
to
take
a
little
flyer
at
guaymas
to
see
if
i
could
run
across
this
handy
solomon
person
but
denton
pointed
out
that
anderson
would
be
expecting
just
that
and
would
take
mighty
good
care
to
be
scarce
his
idea
was
that
we
do
better
to
get
hold
of
a
boat
and
some
water
casks
and
lug
off
the
treasure
we
had
stumbled
over
denton
told
us
that
the
idea
of
going
back
and
scooping
all
that
dinero
up
with
a
shovel
had
kept
him
going
just
as
the
idea
of
getting
even
with
anderson
had
kept
me
going
schwartz
said
that
after
he
carried
that
heavy
gold
over
the
first
day
he
made
up
his
mind
he
get
the
spending
of
it
or
bust
that
why
he
hated
so
to
throw
it
away
there
were
lots
of
fishing
boats
in
the
harbour
and
we
hired
one
and
a
man
to
run
it
for
next
to
nothing
a
week
we
laid
a
course
north
and
in
six
days
anchored
in
our
bay
i
tell
you
it
looked
queer
there
were
the
charred
sticks
of
the
fire
and
the
coffeepot
lying
on
its
side
we
took
off
our
hats
at
poor
billy
grave
a
minute
and
then
climbed
over
the
hill
carrying
our
picks
and
shovels
and
the
canvas
sacks
to
take
the
treasure
away
in
there
was
no
trouble
in
reaching
the
sandy
flat
but
when
we
got
there
we
found
it
torn
up
from
one
end
to
the
other
a
few
scattered
timbers
and
three
empty
chests
with
the
covers
pried
off
alone
remained
handy
solomon
had
been
there
before
us
we
went
back
to
our
boat
sick
at
heart
nobody
said
a
word
we
went
aboard
and
made
our
greaser
boatman
head
for
yuma
it
took
us
a
week
to
get
there
we
were
all
of
us
glum
but
denton
was
the
worst
of
the
lot
even
after
we
got
back
to
town
and
fallen
into
our
old
ways
of
life
he
could
seem
to
get
over
it
he
seemed
plumb
possessed
of
gloom
and
moped
around
like
a
chicken
with
the
pip
this
surprised
me
for
i
did
think
the
loss
of
money
would
hit
him
so
hard
it
did
hit
any
of
us
very
hard
in
those
days
one
evening
i
took
him
aside
and
fed
him
a
drink
and
expostulated
with
him
oh
hell
rogers
he
burst
out
i
do
care
about
the
loot
but
suffering
cats
think
how
that
fellow
sized
us
up
for
a
lot
of
fools
and
how
right
he
was
about
it
why
all
he
did
was
to
sail
out
of
sight
around
the
next
corner
he
knew
we
start
across
country
and
we
did
all
we
had
to
do
was
to
lay
low
and
save
our
legs
he
was
bound
to
come
back
and
we
might
have
nailed
him
when
he
landed
that
about
all
there
was
to
it
concluded
colorado
rogers
after
a
pause
except
that
i
been
looking
for
him
ever
since
and
when
i
heard
you
singing
that
song
i
naturally
thought
i
landed
and
you
never
saw
him
again
asked
windy
bill
well
chuckled
rogers
i
did
about
ten
year
later
it
was
in
tucson
i
was
in
the
back
of
a
store
when
the
door
in
front
opened
and
this
man
came
in
he
stopped
at
the
little
by
the
door
in
about
one
jump
i
was
on
his
neck
i
jerked
him
over
backwards
before
he
knew
what
had
struck
him
threw
him
on
his
face
got
my
hands
in
his
and
began
to
jump
his
features
against
the
floor
then
all
at
once
i
noted
that
this
man
had
two
arms
so
of
course
he
was
the
wrong
fellow
oh
excuse
me
said
i
and
ran
out
the
back
door
chapter
sixteen
the
breed
it
was
sunday
at
the
ranch
for
a
wonder
the
weather
had
been
favourable
the
windmills
were
all
working
the
bogs
had
dried
up
the
beef
had
lasted
over
the
remuda
had
not
strayed
in
short
there
was
nothing
to
do
sang
had
given
us
a
baked
with
raisins
in
it
we
filled
it
in
a
wash
basin
full
of
it
on
top
of
a
few
incidental
pounds
of
chile
con
baked
beans
soda
biscuits
air
tights
and
other
delicacies
then
we
adjourned
with
our
pipes
to
the
shady
side
of
the
blacksmith
shop
where
we
could
watch
the
ravens
on
top
the
adobe
wall
of
the
corral
somebody
told
a
story
about
ravens
this
led
to
this
suggested
rattlesnakes
they
started
windy
bill
speakin
of
snakes
said
windy
i
mind
when
they
catched
the
of
all
the
bullsnakes
up
at
lead
in
the
black
hills
i
was
only
a
kid
then
this
was
no
such
long
a
snake
but
he
was
a
foot
thick
looked
just
like
a
sahuaro
stalk
man
name
of
terwilliger
smith
catched
it
he
named
this
yere
bullsnake
clarence
and
got
it
so
plumb
gentle
it
followed
him
everywhere
one
day
old
barnum
come
along
and
wanted
to
buy
this
clarence
snake
offered
terwilliger
a
thousand
cold
but
smith
would
part
with
the
snake
nohow
so
finally
they
fixed
up
a
deal
so
smith
could
go
along
with
the
show
they
shoved
clarence
in
a
box
in
the
baggage
car
but
after
a
while
snake
gets
so
lonesome
he
gnaws
out
and
starts
to
crawl
back
to
find
his
master
just
as
he
is
between
the
baggage
car
and
the
smoker
the
couplin
give
way
right
on
that
heavy
grade
between
custer
and
rocky
point
well
sir
clarence
wound
his
head
one
brake
wheel
and
his
tail
around
the
other
and
held
that
train
together
to
the
bottom
of
the
grade
but
it
stretched
him
feet
and
they
had
to
advertise
him
as
a
windy
bill
story
of
the
faithful
bullsnake
aroused
to
reminiscence
the
grizzled
stranger
who
thereupon
held
forth
as
follows
wall
i
see
things
and
i
heerd
things
some
of
them
ornery
and
some
you
love
to
believe
they
was
that
gorgeous
and
improbable
history
was
always
my
hobby
and
sportin
events
my
special
pleasure
and
this
yarn
of
windy
reminds
me
of
the
only
chanst
i
ever
had
to
ring
in
business
and
pleasure
and
hobby
all
in
one
grand
of
joy
it
come
about
like
this
one
day
a
few
year
back
i
was
sittin
on
the
beach
at
santa
barbara
watchin
the
sky
stay
up
and
wonderin
what
to
do
with
my
wages
when
a
little
with
big
bow
spectacles
came
and
plumped
down
beside
me
did
you
ever
stop
to
think
says
he
shovin
back
his
hat
that
if
the
horsepower
delivered
by
them
waves
on
this
beach
in
one
single
hour
could
be
concentrated
behind
washin
machines
it
would
be
enough
to
wash
all
the
shirts
for
a
city
of
four
hundred
and
thousand
one
hundred
and
people
ca
say
i
ever
did
says
i
squintin
at
him
sideways
fact
says
he
and
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
that
if
all
the
food
a
man
eats
in
the
course
of
a
natural
life
could
be
gathered
together
at
one
time
it
would
fill
a
twelve
miles
long
you
make
me
hungry
says
i
and
ai
it
interestin
to
reflect
he
goes
on
that
if
all
the
parin
of
the
human
race
for
one
year
was
to
be
collected
and
subjected
to
hydraulic
pressure
it
would
equal
in
size
the
pyramid
of
cheops
look
yere
says
i
sittin
up
did
you
ever
pause
to
excogitate
that
if
all
the
hot
air
you
is
dispensin
was
to
be
collected
together
it
would
fill
a
balloon
big
enough
to
waft
you
and
me
over
that
bullyvard
of
palms
to
yonder
gin
mill
on
the
corner
he
did
say
nothin
to
that
just
yanked
me
to
my
feet
faced
me
towards
the
gin
mill
above
mentioned
and
exerted
considerable
pressure
on
my
arm
in
urgin
of
me
forward
you
ai
so
much
of
a
dreamer
after
all
thinks
i
in
important
matters
you
are
plumb
decisive
we
sat
down
at
little
tables
and
my
friend
ordered
a
beer
and
a
chicken
sandwich
chickens
says
he
gazin
at
the
sandwich
is
a
dollar
apiece
in
this
country
and
plumb
scarce
did
you
ever
pause
to
ponder
over
the
returns
chickens
would
give
on
a
small
investment
say
you
start
with
ten
hens
each
hatches
out
thirteen
aigs
of
which
allow
a
loss
of
say
six
for
childish
accidents
at
the
end
of
the
year
you
has
eighty
chickens
at
the
end
of
two
years
that
flock
has
increased
to
six
hundred
and
twenty
at
the
end
of
the
third
year
he
had
the
medicine
tongue
ten
days
later
him
and
me
was
occupyin
of
an
old
ranch
fifty
mile
from
anywhere
when
they
run
this
joint
used
to
be
a
roadhouse
the
outlook
was
on
about
a
thousand
little
brown
foothills
a
road
two
miles
four
rods
two
foot
eleven
inches
in
sight
run
by
in
front
of
us
it
come
over
one
foothill
and
disappeared
over
another
i
know
just
how
long
it
was
for
later
in
the
game
i
measured
it
out
back
was
about
a
hundred
little
wire
chicken
corrals
filled
with
chickens
we
had
two
kinds
that
was
the
doin
of
tuscarora
my
pardner
called
himself
tuscarora
maxillary
i
asked
him
once
if
that
was
his
real
name
it
the
realest
little
old
name
you
ever
heerd
tell
of
says
he
i
know
for
i
made
it
myself
liked
the
sound
of
her
parents
ai
got
no
rights
to
name
their
children
parents
do
have
to
be
called
them
names
well
these
chickens
as
i
said
was
of
two
kinds
the
first
was
these
heavyweight
propositions
with
feathers
on
their
laigs
and
not
much
laigs
at
that
called
cochin
chinys
the
other
was
a
tall
ridiculous
outfit
made
up
entire
of
bulgin
breast
and
gangle
laigs
they
stood
about
two
foot
and
a
half
tall
and
when
they
went
to
peck
the
ground
their
tail
feathers
stuck
straight
up
to
the
sky
tusky
called
japanese
games
which
the
chief
advantage
of
them
chickens
is
says
he
that
in
weight
about
ninety
per
cent
of
is
breast
meat
now
my
idee
is
that
if
we
can
cross
with
these
cochin
chiny
fowls
we
have
a
heavyweight
chicken
runnin
strong
on
breast
meat
these
jap
games
is
too
small
but
if
we
can
bring
up
in
size
and
shorten
their
laigs
we
shore
have
a
winner
that
looked
good
to
me
so
we
started
in
on
that
idee
the
theery
was
bully
but
she
did
work
out
the
first
broods
we
hatched
growed
up
with
big
husky
cochin
chiny
bodies
and
little
short
necks
perched
up
on
laigs
three
foot
long
them
chickens
could
reach
ground
nohow
we
had
to
build
a
table
for
to
eat
off
and
when
they
went
out
rustlin
for
themselves
they
had
to
confine
themselves
to
sidehills
or
flyin
insects
their
breasts
was
all
right
though
and
think
of
them
drumsticks
for
the
boardinghouse
trade
says
tusky
so
far
things
was
so
bad
we
had
a
good
grubstake
tusky
and
me
used
to
feed
them
chickens
twict
a
day
and
then
used
to
set
around
watchin
the
playful
critters
chase
grasshoppers
up
an
down
the
wire
corrals
while
tusky
figgered
out
what
happen
if
somebody
was
dumfool
enough
to
gather
up
somethin
and
fix
it
in
baskets
or
wagons
or
such
that
was
where
we
showed
our
ignorance
of
chickens
one
day
in
the
spring
i
hitched
up
rustled
a
dozen
of
the
youngsters
into
coops
and
druv
over
to
the
railroad
to
make
our
first
sale
i
could
fold
them
chickens
up
into
them
coops
at
first
but
then
i
stuck
the
coops
up
on
aidge
and
they
worked
all
right
though
i
will
admit
they
was
a
comical
sight
at
the
railroad
one
of
them
towerist
trains
had
just
slowed
down
to
a
halt
as
i
come
up
and
the
towerist
was
paradin
up
and
down
allowin
they
was
particular
enjoyin
of
the
warm
californy
sunshine
one
old
terrapin
with
grey
chin
whiskers
projected
over
with
his
wife
and
took
a
peek
through
the
slats
of
my
coop
he
straightened
up
like
someone
had
touched
him
off
with
a
poker
stranger
said
he
in
a
scared
kind
of
whisper
what
them
them
chickens
says
i
he
took
another
long
look
marthy
says
he
to
the
old
woman
this
will
be
about
all
we
come
out
from
ioway
to
see
the
wonders
of
californy
but
i
ca
go
stronger
than
this
if
these
is
chickens
i
do
want
to
see
no
big
trees
well
i
sold
them
chickens
all
right
for
a
dollar
and
two
bits
which
was
better
than
i
expected
and
got
an
order
for
more
about
ten
days
later
i
got
a
letter
from
the
commission
house
we
are
returnin
a
sample
of
your
arts
and
crafts
chickens
with
the
lovin
marks
of
the
teeth
still
onto
him
says
they
do
send
any
more
till
they
stops
pursuin
of
the
nimble
grasshopper
dentist
bill
will
foller
with
the
letter
came
the
remains
of
one
of
the
chickens
tusky
and
i
very
indignant
cooked
her
for
supper
she
was
tough
all
right
we
thought
she
might
do
better
biled
so
we
put
her
in
the
pot
over
night
nary
bit
well
then
we
got
interested
tusky
kep
the
fire
goin
and
i
rustled
greasewood
we
cooked
her
three
days
and
three
nights
at
the
end
of
that
time
she
was
sort
of
pale
and
frazzled
but
still
givin
points
to
jerky
on
cohesion
and
other
uncompromisin
forces
of
nature
we
buried
her
then
and
went
out
back
to
recuperate
there
we
could
gaze
on
the
smilin
landscape
dotted
by
about
four
hundred
chickens
swoopin
here
and
there
after
grasshoppers
we
got
to
stop
that
says
i
we
ca
murmured
tusky
inspired
we
ca
it
born
in
it
a
primal
instinct
like
the
love
of
a
mother
for
her
young
and
it
ca
be
eradicated
them
chickens
is
constructed
by
a
divine
providence
for
the
express
purpose
of
chasin
grasshoppers
jest
as
the
beaver
is
made
for
buildin
dams
and
the
is
made
for
whisky
and
we
ca
keep
from
it
if
we
was
to
shut
in
a
dark
cellar
they
flop
after
imaginary
grasshoppers
in
their
dreams
and
die
emaciated
in
the
midst
of
plenty
jimmy
we
up
agin
the
cosmos
the
oversoul
oh
he
had
the
medicine
tongue
tusky
had
and
risin
on
the
wings
of
eloquence
that
way
he
had
me
faded
in
ten
minutes
in
fifteen
i
was
wedded
solid
to
the
notion
that
the
bottom
had
dropped
out
of
the
chicken
business
i
think
now
that
if
we
shut
them
hens
up
we
might
have
still
i
do
know
they
was
a
good
deal
in
what
tusky
said
tuscarora
maxillary
says
i
did
you
ever
stop
to
entertain
that
beautiful
thought
that
if
all
the
dumfoolishness
possessed
now
by
the
human
race
could
be
gathered
together
and
lined
up
alongside
of
us
the
first
feller
to
come
along
would
say
to
it
hello
solomon
we
quit
the
notion
of
chickens
for
profit
right
then
and
there
but
we
could
quit
the
place
we
had
much
money
for
one
thing
and
then
we
kind
of
liked
loafin
around
and
raisin
a
little
garden
truck
and
oh
well
i
might
as
well
say
so
we
had
a
notion
about
placers
in
the
dry
wash
back
of
the
house
you
know
how
it
is
so
we
stayed
on
and
kept
these
for
the
fun
of
it
i
used
to
like
to
watch
projectin
around
and
i
fed
twict
a
day
about
as
usual
so
tusky
and
i
lived
alone
there
together
happy
as
ducks
in
arizona
about
in
a
month
somebody
pike
along
the
road
she
was
much
of
a
road
generally
more
chuckholes
than
bumps
though
sometimes
it
was
the
other
way
around
unless
it
happened
to
be
a
man
horseback
or
maybe
a
freighter
without
the
fear
of
god
in
his
soul
we
did
have
no
words
with
them
they
was
too
busy
cussin
the
highways
and
generally
too
mad
for
social
discourses
one
day
early
in
the
year
when
the
mud
made
ruts
to
add
to
the
bumps
one
of
these
automobeels
went
past
it
was
the
first
tusky
and
me
had
seen
in
them
parts
so
we
run
out
to
view
her
owin
to
the
high
spots
on
the
road
she
looked
like
one
of
these
movin
picters
as
to
blur
and
wobble
sounded
like
a
cyclone
mingled
with
and
smelt
like
hell
on
housecleanin
day
which
them
folks
do
seem
to
be
enjoyin
of
the
scenery
says
i
to
tusky
do
you
reckon
that
there
blue
trail
is
smoke
from
the
machine
or
remarks
from
the
inhabitants
thereof
tusky
raised
his
head
and
sniffed
long
and
inquirin
it
langwidge
says
he
did
you
ever
stop
to
think
that
all
the
words
in
the
dictionary
stretched
end
to
end
would
reach
but
at
that
minute
i
catched
sight
of
somethin
brass
lyin
in
the
road
it
proved
to
be
a
sort
of
horn
with
a
rubber
bulb
on
the
end
i
squoze
the
bulb
and
jumped
twenty
foot
over
the
remark
she
made
jarred
off
the
machine
says
tusky
oh
did
it
says
i
my
nerves
still
wrong
i
thought
maybe
it
had
growed
up
from
the
soil
like
a
toadstool
about
this
time
we
abolished
the
wire
chicken
corrals
because
we
needed
some
of
the
wire
them
thereupon
scattered
all
over
the
flat
searchin
out
their
prey
when
feed
time
come
i
had
to
screech
my
lungs
out
gettin
of
in
and
then
sometimes
they
all
hear
it
was
plumb
discouragin
and
i
mighty
nigh
made
up
my
mind
to
quit
but
they
had
come
to
be
sort
of
pets
and
i
hated
to
turn
down
it
used
to
tickle
tusky
almost
to
death
to
see
me
out
there
hollerin
away
like
an
old
he
used
to
come
out
with
his
pipe
lit
just
to
enjoy
me
finally
i
got
mad
and
opened
up
on
him
oh
he
explains
it
just
plumb
amuses
me
to
see
the
dumfool
at
his
childish
work
why
do
you
teach
to
come
to
that
brass
horn
and
save
your
voice
tusky
says
i
with
feelin
sometimes
you
do
seem
to
get
a
glimmer
of
real
sense
well
first
off
them
chickens
used
to
throw
over
that
horn
you
have
no
idee
how
slow
chickens
is
to
learn
things
i
could
tell
you
things
about
chickens
say
this
yere
bluff
about
roosters
bein
gallant
is
all
wrong
i
watched
when
one
finds
a
nice
feed
he
gobbles
it
so
fast
that
the
pieces
foller
down
his
throat
like
yearlin
through
a
hole
in
the
fence
it
only
when
he
scratches
up
a
measly
that
he
calls
up
the
hens
and
stands
noble
and
to
one
side
that
ai
the
point
which
is
that
after
two
months
i
had
them
so
they
drop
everythin
and
come
kitin
at
the
of
that
horn
it
was
a
purty
sight
to
see
sailin
in
from
all
directions
twenty
foot
at
a
stride
i
was
proud
of
and
named
the
breed
we
did
have
no
others
for
by
now
the
coyotes
and
had
nailed
the
there
was
no
wild
cat
or
coyote
could
catch
one
of
my
no
sir
we
made
a
little
on
our
placer
just
enough
to
keep
interested
then
the
supervisors
decided
to
fix
our
road
and
what
more
they
done
it
that
the
only
part
in
this
yarn
that
hard
to
believe
but
boys
you
have
to
take
it
on
faith
they
ploughed
her
and
crowned
her
and
scraped
her
and
rolled
her
and
when
they
moved
on
we
had
the
fanciest
highway
in
the
state
of
californy
that
noon
the
day
they
called
her
a
job
tusky
and
i
sat
smokin
our
pipes
as
per
usual
when
way
over
the
foothills
we
seen
a
cloud
of
dust
and
faint
to
our
ears
was
bore
a
whizzin
sound
the
chickens
was
gathered
under
the
cottonwood
for
the
heat
of
the
day
but
they
pay
no
attention
then
faint
but
clear
we
heard
another
of
them
brass
horns
honk
honk
says
it
and
every
one
of
them
chickens
woke
up
and
stood
at
attention
honk
honk
it
hollered
clearer
and
nearer
then
over
the
hill
come
an
automobeel
blowin
vigorous
at
every
jump
my
god
i
yells
to
tusky
kickin
over
my
chair
as
i
springs
to
my
feet
stop
stop
but
it
was
too
late
out
the
gate
sprinted
them
poor
devoted
chickens
and
up
the
road
they
trailed
in
vain
pursuit
the
last
we
seen
of
was
a
mingling
of
dust
and
dim
figgers
goin
thirty
mile
an
hour
after
a
disappearin
automobeel
that
was
all
we
seen
for
the
moment
about
three
the
first
straggler
came
limpin
in
his
wings
hangin
his
mouth
open
his
eyes
glazed
with
the
heat
by
sundown
fourteen
had
returned
all
the
rest
had
disappeared
utter
we
never
seen
again
i
reckon
they
just
naturally
run
themselves
into
a
sunstroke
and
died
on
the
road
it
takes
a
long
time
to
learn
a
chicken
a
thing
but
a
heap
longer
to
unlearn
him
after
that
two
or
three
of
these
yere
automobeels
went
by
every
day
all
of
their
horns
all
kickin
up
a
hell
of
a
dust
and
every
time
them
fourteen
of
mine
took
along
after
just
as
i
taught
to
do
layin
to
get
to
their
corn
when
they
caught
up
no
more
of
died
but
that
fourteen
did
get
into
elegant
trainin
after
a
while
they
got
plumb
to
enjoyin
it
when
you
come
right
down
to
it
a
chicken
do
have
many
amusements
and
relaxations
in
this
life
searchin
for
worms
chasin
grasshoppers
and
wallerin
in
the
dust
is
about
the
limits
of
joys
for
chickens
it
was
sure
a
fine
sight
to
see
after
they
got
well
into
the
game
about
nine
every
mornin
they
would
saunter
down
to
the
rise
of
the
road
where
they
would
wait
patient
until
a
machine
came
along
then
it
would
warm
your
heart
to
see
the
enthusiasm
of
them
with
exultant
cackles
of
joy
they
trail
in
reachin
out
like
their
wings
half
spread
out
their
eyes
beamin
with
delight
at
the
lower
turn
they
quit
then
after
talkin
it
over
for
a
few
minutes
they
calm
down
and
wait
for
another
after
a
few
months
of
this
sort
of
trainin
they
got
purty
good
at
it
i
had
one
rooster
that
made
mile
an
hour
behind
one
of
those
panhandles
when
cars
did
come
along
often
enough
they
all
turn
out
and
chase
they
much
fun
at
that
after
a
short
brief
sprint
the
rabbit
would
crouch
down
plumb
terrified
while
the
pulled
off
triumphal
dances
around
his
shrinkin
form
our
ranch
got
to
be
purty
well
known
them
days
among
automobeelists
the
strength
of
their
cars
was
of
course
but
the
speed
of
them
they
got
to
ratin
by
some
of
them
used
to
come
way
up
from
los
angeles
just
to
try
out
a
new
car
along
our
road
with
the
for
we
charged
them
a
little
somethin
and
then
too
we
opened
up
the
and
the
bar
so
we
did
purty
well
it
was
necessary
to
work
any
longer
at
that
bogus
placer
evenin
we
sat
around
outside
and
swapped
yarns
and
i
bragged
on
my
chickens
the
chickens
would
gather
round
close
to
listen
they
liked
to
hear
their
praises
sung
all
right
you
bet
they
sabe
the
only
reason
a
chicken
or
any
other
critter
is
intelligent
is
because
he
has
no
chance
to
expand
why
we
used
to
run
races
with
some
of
us
would
hold
two
or
more
chickens
back
of
a
chalk
line
and
the
starter
blow
the
horn
from
a
hundred
yards
to
a
mile
away
dependin
on
whether
it
was
a
sprint
or
for
distance
we
had
pools
on
the
results
gave
odds
made
books
and
kept
records
after
the
thing
got
knowed
we
made
money
hand
over
fist
the
stranger
broke
off
abruptly
and
began
to
roll
a
cigarette
what
did
you
quit
it
for
then
ventured
charley
out
of
the
hushed
silence
pride
replied
the
stranger
solemnly
haughtiness
of
spirit
how
so
urged
charley
after
a
pause
them
chickens
continued
the
stranger
after
a
moment
stood
around
listenin
to
me
of
what
superior
fowls
they
was
until
they
got
all
puffed
up
they
would
have
nothin
whatever
to
do
with
the
ordinary
chickens
we
brought
in
for
eatin
purposes
but
stood
around
lookin
bored
when
there
was
no
sport
doin
they
got
to
be
just
like
that
four
hundred
you
read
about
in
the
papers
it
was
one
continual
round
of
grasshopper
balls
race
meets
and
afternoon
they
got
idle
and
haughty
just
like
folks
then
come
race
suicide
they
got
to
feelin
so
aristocratic
the
hens
have
no
eggs
nobody
dared
say
a
word
windy
bill
snake
began
the
narrator
genially
stranger
broke
in
windy
bill
with
great
emphasis
as
to
that
snake
i
want
you
to
understand
this
yereafter
in
my
estimation
that
snake
is
nothin
but

the

gun
man
chapter
one
the
cattle
rustlers
buck
johnson
was
american
born
but
with
a
black
beard
and
a
dignity
of
manner
that
had
earned
him
the
title
of
senor
he
had
drifted
into
southeastern
arizona
in
the
days
of
cochise
and
victorio
and
geronimo
he
had
persisted
and
so
in
time
had
come
to
control
the
water
and
hence
the
grazing
of
nearly
all
the
soda
springs
valley
his
troubles
were
many
and
his
difficulties
great
there
were
the
ordinary
problems
of
lean
and
dry
years
there
were
also
the
extraordinary
problems
of
devastating
apaches
rivals
for
early
and
range
rights
and
cattle
rustlers
senor
buck
johnson
was
a
man
of
capacity
courage
directness
of
method
and
perseverance
especially
the
latter
therefore
he
had
survived
to
see
the
apaches
subdued
the
range
rights
adjusted
his
cattle
increased
to
thousands
grazing
the
area
of
a
principality
now
all
the
energy
and
fire
of
his
frontiersman
nature
he
had
turned
to
wiping
out
the
third
uncertainty
of
an
uncertain
business
he
found
it
a
task
of
some
magnitude
for
senor
buck
johnson
lived
just
north
of
that
terra
incognita
filled
with
the
mystery
of
a
double
chance
of
death
from
man
or
the
flaming
desert
known
as
the
mexican
border
there
by
natural
gravitation
gathered
all
the
desperate
characters
of
three
states
and
two
republics
he
who
rode
into
it
took
good
care
that
no
one
should
ride
behind
him
lived
warily
slept
light
and
breathed
deep
when
once
he
had
again
sighted
the
familiar
peaks
of
cochise
stronghold
no
one
professed
knowledge
of
those
who
dwelt
therein
they
moved
mysterious
as
the
desert
illusions
that
compassed
them
about
as
you
rode
the
ranges
of
mountains
visibly
changed
form
the
monstrous
snaky
growths
of
the
cactus
clutched
at
your
stirrup
mock
lakes
sparkled
and
dissolved
in
the
middle
distance
the
sun
beat
hot
and
merciless
the
powdered
dry
alkali
beat
hotly
and
mercilessly
back
and
strange
grim
men
swarthy
bearded
heavily
armed
with
unshifting
eyes
rode
silently
out
of
the
mists
of
illusion
to
look
on
you
steadily
and
then
to
ride
silently
back
into
the
desert
haze
they
might
be
only
the
herders
of
the
gaunt
cattle
or
again
they
might
belong
to
the
lost
legion
that
peopled
the
country
all
you
could
know
was
that
of
the
men
who
entered
in
but
few
returned
directly
north
of
this
unknown
land
you
encountered
parallel
fences
running
across
the
country
they
enclosed
nothing
but
offered
a
check
to
the
cattle
drifting
toward
the
clutch
of
the
renegades
and
an
obstacle
to
swift
dashing
forays
of
there
are
various
forms
the
boldest
consists
quite
simply
of
running
off
a
bunch
of
stock
hustling
it
over
the
mexican
line
and
there
selling
it
to
some
of
the
big
sonora
ranch
owners
generally
this
sort
means
war
also
are
there
subtler
means
grading
in
skill
from
the
through
a
wet
blanket
through
the
crafty
refashioning
of
a
brand
to
the
various
methods
of
separating
the
cow
from
her
unbranded
calf
in
the
course
of
his
task
senor
buck
johnson
would
have
to
do
with
them
all
but
at
present
he
existed
in
a
state
of
warfare
fighting
an
enemy
who
stole
as
the
indians
used
to
steal
already
he
had
fought
two
pitched
battles
and
had
won
them
both
his
cattle
increased
and
he
became
rich
nevertheless
he
knew
that
constantly
his
resources
were
being
drained
time
and
again
he
and
his
new
texas
foreman
jed
parker
had
followed
the
trail
of
a
stampeded
bunch
of
twenty
or
thirty
followed
them
on
down
through
the
soda
springs
valley
to
the
cut
drift
fences
there
to
abandon
them
for
as
yet
an
armed
force
would
be
needed
to
penetrate
the
borderland
once
he
and
his
men
bad
experienced
the
glory
of
a
night
pursuit
then
at
the
drift
fences
he
had
fought
one
of
his
battles
but
it
was
impossible
adequately
to
patrol
all
parts
of
a
range
bigger
than
some
eastern
states
buck
johnson
did
his
best
but
it
was
like
stopping
with
sand
the
innumerable
little
leaks
of
a
dam
did
his
riders
watch
toward
the
chiricahuas
then
a
score
of
beef
steers
disappeared
from
grant
pass
forty
miles
away
pursuit
here
meant
leaving
cattle
unguarded
there
it
was
useless
and
the
senor
soon
perceived
that
sooner
or
later
he
must
strike
in
offence
for
this
purpose
he
began
slowly
to
strengthen
the
forces
of
his
riders
men
were
coming
in
from
texas
they
were
good
men
addicted
to
the
the
double
cinch
and
the
stirrup
senor
johnson
wanted
men
who
could
shoot
and
he
got
them
jed
said
senor
johnson
to
his
foreman
the
next
son
of
a
gun
that
rustles
any
of
our
cows
is
sure
loading
himself
full
of
trouble
hit
his
trail
and
will
stay
with
it
and
we
reach
his
conscience
with
a
rope
so
it
came
about
that
a
little
army
crossed
the
drift
fences
and
entered
the
border
country
two
days
later
it
came
out
and
mighty
pleased
to
be
able
to
do
so
the
rope
had
not
been
used
the
reason
for
the
defeat
was
quite
simple
the
thief
had
run
his
cattle
through
the
lava
beds
where
the
trail
at
once
became
difficult
to
follow
this
delayed
the
pursuing
party
they
ran
out
of
water
and
as
there
was
among
them
not
one
man
well
enough
acquainted
with
the
country
to
know
where
to
find
more
they
had
to
return
no
use
buck
said
jed
we
any
of
us
come
in
on
a
gun
play
but
we
ca
buck
the
desert
we
have
to
get
someone
who
knows
the
country
that
all
right
but
where
queried
johnson
there
pereza
suggested
parker
it
the
only
town
down
near
that
country
might
get
someone
there
agreed
the
senor
next
day
he
rode
away
in
search
of
a
guide
the
third
evening
he
was
back
again
much
discouraged
the
country
no
good
he
explained
the
regular
inhabitants
a
set
of
mexican
bums
and
old
soaks
the
cowmen
all
from
north
and
do
know
nothing
more
than
we
do
i
found
lots
who
claimed
to
know
that
country
but
when
i
told
what
i
wanted
they
shied
like
a
colt
i
could
hire
for
no
money
to
go
down
in
that
country
they
ai
got
the
nerve
i
took
two
days
to
her
too
and
rode
out
to
a
ranch
where
they
said
a
man
lived
who
knew
all
about
it
down
there
nary
riffle
man
looked
all
right
but
his
tail
went
down
like
the
rest
when
i
told
him
what
we
wanted
seemed
plumb
scairt
to
death
says
he
lives
too
close
to
the
gang
says
they
wipe
him
out
sure
if
he
done
it
seemed
plumb
scairt
buck
johnson
grinned
i
told
him
so
and
he
got
hosstyle
right
off
did
seem
no
ways
scairt
of
me
i
do
know
what
the
matter
with
that
outfit
down
there
plumb
terrorised
that
night
a
bunch
of
steers
was
stolen
from
the
very
corrals
of
the
home
ranch
the
home
ranch
was
far
north
near
fort
sherman
itself
and
so
had
always
been
considered
immune
from
attack
consequently
these
steers
were
very
fine
ones
for
the
first
time
buck
johnson
lost
his
head
and
his
dignity
he
ordered
the
horses
i
going
to
follow
that
into
sonora
he
shouted
to
jed
parker
this
thing
got
to
stop
you
ca
make
her
buck
objected
the
foreman
you
get
held
up
by
the
desert
and
if
that
do
finish
you
they
tangle
you
up
in
all
those
little
mountains
down
there
and
ambush
you
and
massacre
you
you
know
it
damn
well
i
do
give
a
exploded
senor
johnson
if
they
do
no
man
can
slap
my
face
and
not
get
a
run
for
it
jed
parker
communed
with
himself
senor
said
he
at
last
it
no
good
you
ca
do
it
you
got
to
have
a
guide
you
wait
three
days
and
i
get
you
one
you
ca
do
it
insisted
the
senor
i
tried
every
man
in
the
district
will
you
wait
three
days
repeated
the
foreman
johnson
pulled
loose
his
latigo
his
first
anger
had
cooled
all
right
he
agreed
and
you
can
say
for
me
that
i
pay
five
thousand
dollars
in
gold
and
give
all
the
men
and
horses
he
needs
to
the
man
who
has
the
nerve
to
get
back
that
bunch
of
cattle
and
bring
in
the
man
who
rustled
them
i
sure
make
this
a
test
case
so
jed
parker
set
out
to
discover
his
man
with
nerve
chapter
two
the
man
with
nerve
at
about
ten
of
the
fourth
of
july
a
rider
topped
the
summit
of
the
last
swell
of
land
and
loped
his
animal
down
into
the
single
street
of
pereza
the
buildings
on
either
side
were
and
coated
with
plaster
over
the
sidewalks
extended
wooden
awnings
beneath
which
opened
very
wide
doors
into
the
coolness
of
saloons
each
of
these
places
ran
a
bar
and
also
games
of
roulette
faro
craps
and
stud
poker
even
this
early
in
the
morning
every
game
was
patronised
the
day
was
already
hot
with
the
dry
breathless
but
exhilarating
heat
of
the
desert
a
throng
of
men
idling
at
the
edge
of
the
sidewalks
jostling
up
and
down
their
centre
or
eddying
into
the
places
of
amusement
acknowledged
the
power
of
summer
by
loosening
their
collars
carrying
their
coats
on
their
arms
they
were
as
yet
busily
engaged
in
recognising
acquaintances
later
they
would
drink
freely
and
gamble
and
perhaps
fight
toward
all
but
those
whom
they
recognised
they
preserved
an
attitude
of
potential
suspicion
for
here
were
gathered
the
bad
men
of
the
border
countries
a
certain
jealousy
or
touchy
egotism
lest
the
other
man
be
considered
quicker
on
the
trigger
bolder
more
aggressive
than
himself
kept
each
strung
to
tension
an
occasional
shot
attracted
little
notice
men
in
the
shoot
as
casually
as
we
strike
matches
and
some
subtle
instinct
told
them
that
the
reports
were
harmless
as
the
rider
entered
the
one
street
however
a
more
definite
cause
of
excitement
drew
the
loose
population
toward
the
centre
of
the
road
immediately
their
mass
blotted
out
what
had
interested
them
curiosity
attracted
the
saunterers
then
in
turn
the
frequenters
of
the
bars
and
gambling
games
in
a
very
few
moments
the
barkeepers
gamblers
and
men
held
aloof
only
by
the
necessities
of
their
calling
alone
of
all
the
population
of
pereza
were
not
included
in
the
ring
the
stranger
pushed
his
horse
resolutely
to
the
outer
edge
of
the
crowd
where
from
his
point
of
vantage
he
could
easily
overlook
their
heads
he
was
a
young
fellow
rather
neatly
dressed
in
the
border
costume
rode
a
centre
fire
or
saddle
and
wore
no
chaps
he
was
what
is
known
as
a
man
that
is
to
say
he
wore
a
heavy
colt
revolver
on
either
hip
the
fact
that
the
lower
ends
of
his
holsters
were
tied
down
in
order
to
facilitate
the
easy
withdrawal
of
the
revolvers
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
expected
to
use
them
he
had
furthermore
a
quiet
grey
eye
with
the
glint
of
steel
that
bore
out
the
inference
of
the
tied
holsters
the
newcomer
dropped
his
reins
on
his
pony
neck
eased
himself
to
an
attitude
of
attention
and
looked
down
gravely
on
what
was
taking
place
he
saw
over
the
heads
of
the
bystanders
a
tall
muscular
man
hatless
his
hair
rumpled
into
staring
confusion
his
right
sleeve
rolled
to
his
shoulder
a
knife
in
his
hand
and
a
red
bandana
handkerchief
hanging
by
one
corner
from
his
teeth
what
biting
the
locoed
stranger
the
young
man
inquired
of
his
neighbour
the
other
frowned
at
him
darkly
dare
anyone
to
take
the
other
end
of
that
handkerchief
in
his
teeth
and
fight
it
out
without
letting
go
nice
joyful
proposition
commented
the
young
man
he
settled
himself
to
closer
attention
the
man
was
talking
rapidly
what
he
said
can
not
be
printed
here
mainly
was
it
derogatory
of
the
southern
countries
shortly
it
became
boastful
of
the
northern
and
then
of
the
man
who
uttered
it
he
swaggered
up
and
down
becoming
always
the
more
insolent
as
his
challenge
remained
untaken
why
do
you
take
him
up
inquired
the
young
man
after
a
moment
not
me
negatived
the
other
vigorously
i
go
yore
little
old
gunfight
to
a
finish
but
i
do
want
any
cold
steel
in
mine
ugh
it
gives
me
the
shivers
it
a
mexican
trick
with
a
gun
down
and
out
but
this
knife
work
is
too
slow
and
searchin
the
newcomer
said
nothing
but
fixed
his
eye
again
on
the
raging
man
with
the
knife
do
you
reckon
he
bluffing
he
inquired
not
any
denied
the
other
with
emphasis
he
jest
drunk
enough
to
be
crazy
mad
the
newcomer
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
cast
his
glance
searchingly
over
the
fringe
of
the
crowd
it
rested
on
a
mexican
hi
tony
come
here
he
called
the
mexican
approached
flashing
his
white
teeth
here
said
the
stranger
lend
me
your
knife
a
minute
the
mexican
anticipating
sport
of
his
own
peculiar
kind
obeyed
with
alacrity
you
fellows
make
me
tired
observed
the
stranger
dismounting
got
the
whole
townful
of
you
bluffed
to
a
standstill
damn
if
i
try
his
little
game
he
hung
his
coat
on
his
saddle
shouldered
his
way
through
the
press
which
parted
for
him
readily
and
picked
up
the
other
corner
of
the
handkerchief
now
you
mangy
son
of
a
gun
said
he
chapter
three
the
agreement
jed
parker
straightened
his
back
rolled
up
the
bandana
handkerchief
and
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
hit
flat
with
his
hand
the
touselled
mass
of
his
hair
and
thrust
the
long
hunting
knife
into
its
sheath
you
the
man
i
want
said
he
instantly
the
man
had
jerked
loose
his
weapons
and
was
covering
the
foreman
am
i
he
snarled
not
jest
that
way
explained
parker
my
gun
is
on
my
hoss
and
you
can
have
this
old
if
you
want
it
i
been
looking
for
you
and
took
this
way
of
finding
you
now
let
go
talk
the
stranger
looked
him
in
the
eye
for
nearly
a
half
minute
without
lowering
his
revolvers
i
go
you
said
he
briefly
at
last
but
the
crowd
missing
the
purport
and
in
fact
the
very
occurrence
of
this
colloquy
did
not
understand
it
thought
the
bluff
had
been
called
and
naturally
finding
harmless
what
had
intimidated
it
gave
way
to
an
exasperated
impulse
to
get
even
you
bluffer
shouted
a
voice
do
you
think
you
can
run
any
such
ranikaboo
here
jed
parker
turned
humorously
to
his
companion
do
we
get
that
talk
he
inquired
gently
for
answer
the
man
turned
and
walked
steadily
in
the
direction
of
the
man
who
had
shouted
the
latter
hand
strayed
uncertainly
toward
his
own
weapon
but
the
movement
paused
when
the
clear
steel
eye
rested
on
it
this
gentleman
pointed
out
the
man
softly
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
do
you
get
to
calling
of
him
names
his
eye
swept
the
bystanders
calmly
come
on
jack
said
he
addressing
parker
on
the
outskirts
he
encountered
the
mexican
from
whom
he
had
borrowed
the
knife
here
tony
said
he
with
a
slight
laugh
here
a
peso
you
find
your
knife
back
there
where
i
had
to
drop
her
he
entered
a
saloon
nodded
to
the
proprietor
and
led
the
way
through
it
to
a
boxlike
room
containing
a
board
table
and
two
chairs
make
good
he
commanded
briefly
i
looking
for
a
man
with
nerve
explained
parker
with
equal
succinctness
you

man
well
do
you
know
the
country
south
of
here
the
stranger
eyes
narrowed

said
he
i
foreman

the
lazy

parker
i
looking
for

and
sabe
of
the
country

to
lead
a
posse
after
into
the
border

admitted
the
stranger
so
do
plenty
of
others
but
their
eyes
stick
out
like
two
raw
oysters
when
you
mention
the
border
country
will
you
tackle
it
what
the
proposition
come
and
see
the
old
man
he
put
it
to
you
they
mounted
their
horses
and
rode
the
rest
of
the
day
the
desert
compassed
them
about
marvellously
changing
shape
and
colour
and
every
character
with
all
the
noiselessness
of
phantasmagoria
at
evening
the
desert
stars
shone
steady
and
unwinking
like
the
flames
of
candles
by
moonrise
they
came
to
the
home
ranch
the
buildings
and
corrals
lay
dark
and
silent
against
the
moonlight
that
made
of
the
plain
a
sea
of
mist
the
two
men
unsaddled
their
horses
and
turned
them
loose
in
the
pasture
the
necessary
noises
of
their
movements
sounding
sharp
and
clear
against
the
velvet
hush
of
the
night
after
a
moment
they
walked
stiffly
past
the
sheds
and
cook
shanty
past
the
men
bunk
houses
and
the
tall
windmill
silhouetted
against
the
sky
to
the
main
building
of
the
home
ranch
under
its
great
cottonwoods
there
a
light
still
burned
for
this
was
the
third
day
and
buck
johnson
awaited
his
foreman
jed
parker
pushed
in
without
ceremony
here
your
man
buck
said
he
the
stranger
had
stepped
inside
and
carefully
closed
the
door
behind
him
the
lamplight
threw
into
relief
the
bold
free
lines
of
his
face
the
details
of
his
costume
powdered
thick
with
alkali
the
shiny
butts
of
the
two
guns
in
their
open
holsters
tied
at
the
bottom
equally
it
defined
the
resolute
countenance
of
buck
johnson
turned
up
in
inquiry
the
two
men
examined
each
other
and
liked
each
other
at
once
how
are
you
greeted
the
cattleman
responded
the
stranger
sit
down
invited
buck
johnson
the
stranger
perched
gingerly
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
with
an
appearance
less
of
embarrassment
than
of
habitual
alertness
you
take
the
job
inquired
the
senor
i
have
heard
what
it
is
replied
the
stranger
parker
here
said
you
explain
very
well
said
buck
johnson
he
paused
a
moment
collecting
his
thoughts
there
too
much
here
i
going
to
stop
it
i
got
good
men
here
ready
to
take
the
job
but
no
one
who
knows
the
country
south
three
days
ago
i
had
a
bunch
of
cattle
stolen
right
here
from
the
corrals
and
by
one
man
at
that
it
much
of
a
bunch
about
twenty
head
but
i
going
to
make
a
starter
right
here
and
now
i
going
to
get
that
bunch
back
and
the
man
who
stole
them
if
i
have
to
go
to
hell
to
do
it
and
i
going
to
do
the
same
with
every
case
of
rustling
that
comes
up
from
now
on
i
care
if
it
only
one
cow
i
going
to
get
it
back
every
trip
now
i
want
to
know
if
you
lead
a
posse
down
into
the
south
country
and
bring
out
that
last
bunch
and
the
man
who
rustled
them
i
do
know
hesitated
the
stranger
i
offer
you
five
thousand
dollars
in
gold
if
you
bring
back
those
cows
and
the
man
who
stole
repeated
buck
johnson
and
i
give
you
all
the
horses
and
men
you
think
you
need
i
do
it
replied
the
man
promptly
good
cried
buck
johnson
and
you
better
start
i
shall
start
right
now
better
yet
how
many
men
do
you
want
and
grub
for
how
long
i
play
her
a
lone
hand
alone
exclaimed
johnson
his
confidence
visibly
cooling
alone
do
you
think
you
can
make
her
i
be
back
with
those
cattle
in
not
more
than
ten
days
and
the
man
supplemented
the
senor
and
the
man
what
more
i
want
that
money
here
when
i
come
in
i
do
aim
to
stay
in
this
country
over
night
a
grin
overspread
buck
johnson
countenance
he
understood
climate
not
healthy
for
you
he
hazarded
i
guess
you
be
safe
enough
all
right
with
us
but
suit
yourself
the
money
will
be
here
that
agreed
insisted
the
man
sure
i
want
a
fresh
horse
i
leave
mine
he
a
good
one
i
want
a
little
grub
all
right
parker
fit
you
out
the
stranger
rose
i
see
you
in
about
ten
days
good
luck
senor
buck
johnson
wished
him
chapter
four
the
accomplishment
the
next
morning
buck
johnson
took
a
trip
down
into
the
pasture
of
five
hundred
acres
he
means
business
he
confided
to
jed
parker
on
his
return
that
cavallo
of
his
is
a
heap
sight
better
than
the
shorty
horse
we
let
him
take
jed
you
found
your
man
with
nerve
all
right
how
did
you
do
it
the
two
settled
down
to
wait
if
not
with
confidence
at
least
with
interest
sometimes
remembering
the
desperate
character
of
the
outlaws
their
fierce
distrust
of
any
intruder
the
wildness
of
the
country
buck
johnson
and
his
foreman
inclined
to
the
belief
that
the
stranger
had
undertaken
a
task
beyond
the
powers
of
any
one
man
again
remembering
the
stranger
cool
grey
eye
the
poise
of
his
demeanour
the
quickness
of
his
movements
and
the
two
guns
with
tied
holsters
to
permit
of
easy
withdrawal
they
were
almost
persuaded
that
he
might
win
he
one
of
those
fellows
surmised
jed
he
likes
excitement
i
see
that
by
the
way
he
takes
up
with
my
knife
play
he
rather
leave
his
hide
on
the
fence
than
stay
in
the
corral
well
he
all
right
replied
senor
buck
johnson
and
if
he
ever
gets
back
which
same
i
some
doubtful
of
his
dinero
be
here
for
him
in
pursuance
of
this
he
rode
in
to
willets
where
shortly
the
overland
train
brought
him
from
tucson
the
five
thousand
dollars
in
double
eagles
in
the
meantime
the
regular
life
of
the
ranch
went
on
each
morning
sang
the
chinese
cook
rang
the
great
bell
summoning
the
men
they
ate
and
then
caught
up
the
saddle
horses
for
the
day
turning
those
not
wanted
from
the
corral
into
the
pasture
shortly
they
jingled
away
in
different
directions
two
by
two
on
the
slow
spanish
trot
of
the
all
day
long
thus
they
would
ride
without
food
or
water
for
man
or
beast
looking
the
range
identifying
the
stock
branding
the
young
calves
examining
generally
into
the
state
of
affairs
gazing
always
with
grave
eyes
on
the
magnificent
flaming
changing
beautiful
dreadful
desert
of
the
arizona
plains
at
evening
when
the
coloured
atmosphere
catching
the
last
glow
threw
across
the
chiricahuas
its
veil
of
mystery
they
jingled
in
again
two
by
two
untired
unhasting
the
glory
of
the
desert
in
their
steady
eyes
and
all
the
day
long
while
they
were
absent
the
cattle
too
made
their
pilgrimage
straggling
in
singly
in
pairs
in
bunches
in
long
files
leisurely
ruminantly
without
haste
there
at
the
long
troughs
filled
by
the
windmill
of
the
blindfolded
pump
mule
they
drank
then
filed
away
again
into
the
mists
of
the
desert
and
senor
buck
johnson
or
his
foreman
parker
examined
them
for
their
condition
noting
the
increase
remarking
the
strays
from
another
range
later
perhaps
they
too
rode
abroad
the
same
thing
happened
at
nine
other
ranches
from
five
to
ten
miles
apart
where
dwelt
other
fierce
silent
men
all
under
the
authority
of
buck
johnson
and
when
night
fell
and
the
topaz
and
violet
and
saffron
and
amethyst
and
mauve
and
lilac
had
faded
suddenly
from
the
chiricahuas
like
a
veil
that
has
been
rent
and
the
ramparts
had
become
and
then
black
the
night
wandered
here
and
there
over
the
desert
and
the
land
fell
under
an
enchantment
even
stranger
than
the
day
so
the
days
went
by
wonderful
fashioning
the
ways
and
the
characters
of
men
seven
passed
buck
johnson
and
his
foreman
began
to
look
for
the
stranger
eight
they
began
to
speculate
nine
they
doubted
on
the
tenth
they
gave
him
up
and
he
came
they
knew
him
first
by
the
soft
lowing
of
cattle
jed
parker
dazzled
by
the
lamp
peered
out
from
the
door
and
made
him
out
dimly
turning
the
animals
into
the
corral
a
moment
later
his
pony
hoofs
impacted
softly
on
the
baked
earth
he
dropped
from
the
saddle
and
entered
the
room
i
late
said
he
briefly
glancing
at
the
clock
which
indicated
ten
but
i
here
his
manner
was
quick
and
sharp
almost
breathless
as
though
he
had
been
running
your
cattle
are
in
the
corral
all
of
them
have
you
the
money
i
have
the
money
here
replied
buck
johnson
laying
his
hand
against
a
drawer
and
it
ready
for
you
when
you
earned
it
i
do
care
so
much
for
the
cattle
what
i
wanted
is
the
man
who
stole
them
did
you
bring
him
yes
i
brought
him
said
the
stranger
let
see
that
money
buck
johnson
threw
open
the
drawer
and
drew
from
it
the
heavy
canvas
sack
it
here
now
bring
in
your
prisoner
the
man
seemed
suddenly
to
loom
large
in
the
doorway
the
muzzles
of
his
revolvers
covered
the
two
before
him
his
speech
came
short
and
sharp
i
told
you
i
bring
back
the
cows
and
the
one
who
rustled
them
he
snapped
i
never
lied
to
a
man
yet
your
stock
is
in
the
corral
i
trouble
you
for
that
five
thousand
i
the
man
who
stole
your
cattle
part
iii
the
rawhide
chapter
one
the
passing
of
the
colt
the
man
of
whom
i
am
now
to
tell
you
came
to
arizona
in
the
early
days
of
chief
cochise
he
settled
in
the
soda
springs
valley
and
there
persisted
in
spite
of
the
devastating
forays
of
that
apache
after
a
time
he
owned
all
the
wells
and
springs
in
the
valley
and
so
naturally
controlled
the
grazing
on
that
extensive
free
range
once
a
day
the
cattle
in
twos
and
threes
in
bands
in
strings
could
be
seen
winding
leisurely
down
the
and
converging
trails
to
the
water
troughs
at
the
home
ranch
there
leisurely
to
drink
and
then
leisurely
to
drift
away
into
the
saffron
and
violet
and
amethyst
distances
of
the
desert
at
ten
other
outlying
ranches
this
daily
scene
was
repeated
all
these
cattle
belonged
to
the
man
great
by
reason
of
his
priority
in
the
country
the
balance
of
his
even
character
and
the
grim
determination
of
his
spirit
when
he
had
first
entered
soda
springs
valley
his
companions
had
called
him
buck
johnson
since
then
his
form
had
squared
his
eyes
had
steadied
to
the
serenity
of
a
great
authority
his
mouth
shadowed
by
the
moustache
and
the
beard
had
closed
straight
in
the
line
of
power
and
taciturnity
there
was
about
him
more
than
a
trace
of
the
spanish
so
now
he
was
known
as
senor
johnson
although
in
reality
he
was
straight
american
enough
senor
johnson
lived
at
the
home
ranch
with
a
chinese
cook
and
parker
his
foreman
the
home
ranch
was
of
adobe
built
with
loopholes
like
a
fort
in
the
obsolescence
of
this
necessity
other
buildings
had
sprung
up
unfortified
an
adobe
bunkhouse
for
the
an
adobe
blacksmith
shop
a
long
low
stable
a
shed
a
windmill
and
reservoir
a
whole
system
of
corrals
of
different
sizes
a
vegetable
garden
these
gathered
to
themselves
cottonwoods
from
the
moisture
of
their
being
and
so
added
each
a
little
to
the
green
spot
in
the
desert
in
the
smallest
corral
between
the
stable
and
the
shed
stood
a
buckboard
and
a
heavy
wagon
the
only
wheeled
vehicles
about
the
place
under
the
shed
were
rows
of
saddles
riatas
spurs
mounted
with
silver
bits
ornamented
with
the
same
metal
curved
short
irons
for
the
range
branding
long
heavy
stamps
for
the
corral
branding
behind
the
stable
lay
the
pasture
a
thousand
acres
of
desert
fenced
in
with
wire
there
the
hardy
sought
out
the
sparse
but
nutritious
bunch
grass
sixty
of
them
beautiful
as
antelope
for
they
were
the
pick
of
senor
johnson
herds
and
all
about
lay
the
desert
shimmering
changing
wonderful
hemmed
in
by
the
mountains
that
seemed
tenuous
and
thin
like
beautiful
mists
and
by
the
sky
that
seemed
hard
and
polished
like
a
turquoise
each
morning
at
six
the
ten
of
the
home
ranch
drove
the
horses
to
the
corral
neatly
roped
the
dozen
to
be
kept
up
for
that
day
and
rewarded
the
rest
with
a
feed
of
grain
then
they
rode
away
at
a
little
fox
trot
two
by
two
all
day
long
they
travelled
thus
conducting
the
business
of
the
range
and
at
night
having
completed
the
circle
they
jingled
again
into
the
corral
at
the
ten
other
ranches
this
programme
had
been
duplicated
the
men
of
senor
johnson
outfit
had
covered
the
area
of
a
european
principality
and
all
of
it
every
acre
every
spear
of
grass
every
cactus
prickle
every
creature
on
it
practically
belonged
to
senor
johnson
because
senor
johnson
owned
the
water
and
without
water
one
can
not
exist
on
the
desert
this
result
had
not
been
gained
without
struggle
the
fact
could
be
read
in
the
settled
lines
of
senor
johnson
face
and
the
great
calm
of
his
grey
eye
indian
days
drove
him
often
to
the
shelter
of
the
loopholed
adobe
ranch
house
there
to
await
the
soldiers
from
the
fort
in
plain
sight
thirty
miles
away
on
the
slope
that
led
to
the
foot
of
the
chiricahuas
he
lost
cattle
and
some
men
but
the
profits
were
great
and
in
time
cochise
geronimo
and
the
lesser
lights
had
flickered
out
in
the
winds
of
destiny
the
sheep
terror
merely
threatened
for
it
was
soon
discovered
that
with
the
feed
of
soda
springs
valley
grew
a
burr
that
annoyed
the
flocks
beyond
reason
so
the
bleating
scourge
swept
by
forty
miles
away
cattle
rustling
so
near
the
mexican
line
was
an
easy
matter
for
a
time
senor
johnson
commanded
an
armed
band
he
was
lord
of
the
high
the
low
and
the
middle
justice
he
violated
international
ethics
and
for
the
laws
of
nations
he
substituted
his
own
one
by
one
he
annihilated
the
thieves
of
cattle
sometimes
in
open
fight
but
oftener
by
surprise
and
deliberate
massacre
the
country
was
delivered
and
then
with
indefatigable
energy
senor
johnson
became
a
skilled
detective
alone
or
with
parker
his
foreman
he
rode
the
country
through
gathering
evidence
when
the
evidence
was
unassailable
he
brought
offenders
to
book
the
rebranding
through
a
wet
blanket
he
knew
and
could
prove
the
of
an
unbranded
calf
until
it
could
be
weaned
he
understood
the
paring
of
hoofs
to
prevent
travelling
he
could
tell
as
far
as
he
could
see
the
crafty
alteration
of
similar
brands
as
when
a
mexican
changed
johnson
lazy
y
to
a
bar
he
saw
through
at
a
glance
in
short
the
hundred
and
one
petty
tricks
of
the
he
ferreted
out
in
danger
of
his
life
then
he
sent
to
phoenix
for
a
ranger
and
that
was
the
last
of
the
bar
brand
or
the
three
link
bar
brand
or
the
hour
glass
brand
or
a
half
dozen
others
the
soda
springs
valley
acquired
a
reputation
for
good
order
senor
johnson
at
this
stage
of
his
career
found
himself
dropping
into
a
routine
in
march
began
the
spring
branding
then
the
corralling
and
breaking
of
the
wild
horses
the
summer
the
great
fall
the
shipping
of
cattle
and
the
riding
of
the
winter
range
this
happened
over
and
over
again
you
and
i
would
not
have
suffered
from
ennui
the
roping
and
throwing
and
branding
the
wild
swing
and
dash
of
handling
stock
the
mad
races
to
head
the
mustangs
the
fierce
combats
to
subdue
these
raging
wild
beasts
to
the
saddle
the
spectacle
of
the
with
its
brutish
multitudes
and
its
graceful
riders
the
dust
and
monotony
and
excitement
and
glory
of
the
trail
and
especially
the
hundreds
of
incidental
and
gratuitous
adventures
of
bears
and
antelope
of
thirst
and
heat
of
the
joy
of
taking
care
of
one
self
all
these
would
have
filled
our
days
with
the
glittering
changing
throng
of
the
unusual
but
to
senor
johnson
it
had
become
an
old
story
after
the
days
of
construction
the
days
of
accomplishment
seemed
to
him
lean
his
men
did
the
work
and
reaped
the
excitement
senor
johnson
never
thought
now
of
riding
the
wild
horses
of
swinging
the
rope
coiled
at
his
saddle
horn
or
of
rounding
ahead
of
the
flying
herds
his
inspections
were
business
inspections
the
country
was
tame
the
leather
chaps
with
the
silver
conchas
hung
behind
the
door
the
colt
depended
at
the
head
of
the
bed
senor
johnson
rode
in
mufti
of
his
cowboy
days
persisted
still
the
boots
and
spurs
the
broad
stetson
hat
and
the
fringed
buckskin
gauntlets
the
colt
had
been
the
last
to
go
finally
one
evening
senor
johnson
received
an
express
package
he
opened
it
before
the
undemonstrative
parker
it
proved
to
contain
a
pocket
gun
a
calibre
smith
wesson
senor
johnson
examined
it
a
little
doubtfully
in
comparison
with
the
it
looked
like
a
toy
how
do
you
like
her
he
inquired
handing
the
weapon
to
parker
parker
turned
it
over
and
over
as
a
child
a
rattle
then
he
returned
it
to
its
owner
senor
said
he
if
ever
you
shoot
me
with
that
little
old
gun
and
i
find
it
out
the
same
day
i
just
raise
hell
with
you
i
do
reckon
she
injure
a
man
much
agreed
the
senor
but
perhaps
she
call
his
attention
however
the
little
old
gun
took
its
place
not
in
senor
hip
pocket
but
inside
the
front
waistband
of
his
trousers
and
the
old
shiny
colt
with
its
worn
leather
texas
style
holster
became
a
bedroom
ornament
thus
from
a
frontiersman
dropped
senor
johnson
to
the
status
of
a
property
owner
in
a
general
way
he
had
to
attend
to
his
interests
before
the
cattlemen
association
he
had
to
arrange
for
the
buying
and
shipping
and
the
rest
was
leisure
he
could
now
have
gone
away
somewhere
as
far
as
time
went
so
can
a
fish
live
in
trees
as
far
as
time
goes
and
in
the
daily
riding
riding
riding
over
the
range
he
found
the
opportunity
for
abstract
thought
which
the
frontier
life
had
crowded
aside
chapter
two
the
shapes
of
illusion
every
day
as
always
senor
johnson
rode
abroad
over
the
land
his
surroundings
had
before
been
accepted
casually
as
a
more
or
less
pertinent
setting
of
action
and
condition
now
he
sensed
some
of
the
fascination
of
the
arizona
desert
he
noticed
many
things
before
unnoticed
as
he
jingled
loosely
along
on
his
he
observed
how
the
animal
waded
fetlock
deep
in
the
gorgeous
orange
california
poppies
and
then
he
looked
up
and
about
and
saw
that
the
rich
colour
carpeted
the
landscape
as
far
as
his
eye
could
reach
so
that
it
seemed
as
though
he
could
ride
on
and
on
through
them
to
the
distant
chiricahuas
only
close
under
the
hills
lay
unobtrusive
a
narrow
streak
of
grey
and
in
a
few
hours
he
had
reached
the
streak
of
grey
and
ridden
out
into
it
to
find
himself
the
centre
of
a
limitless
alkali
plain
so
that
again
it
seemed
the
valley
could
contain
nothing
else
of
importance
looking
back
senor
johnson
could
discern
a
tenuous
ribbon
of
orange
the
poppies
and
perhaps
ahead
a
little
shadow
blotted
the
face
of
the
alkali
which
being
reached
and
entered
spread
like
fire
until
it
too
filled
the
whole
plain
until
it
too
arrogated
to
itself
the
right
of
typifying
soda
springs
valley
as
a
shimmering
prairie
of
mesquite
flowered
upland
dead
lowland
brush
cactus
volcanic
rock
sand
each
of
these
for
the
time
being
occupied
the
whole
space
broad
as
the
sea
in
the
circlet
of
the
mountains
was
room
for
many
infinities
among
the
foothills
senor
johnson
for
the
first
time
appreciated
colour
hundreds
of
acres
of
flowers
filled
the
velvet
creases
of
the
little
hills
and
washed
over
the
smooth
rounded
slopes
so
accurately
in
the
placing
and
manner
of
tinted
shadows
that
the
mind
had
difficulty
in
believing
the
colour
not
to
have
been
shaded
in
actually
by
free
sweeps
of
some
gigantic
brush
a
dozen
shades
of
pinks
and
purples
a
dozen
of
blues
and
then
the
flame
reds
the
yellows
and
the
vivid
greens
beyond
were
the
mountains
in
their
glory
of
volcanic
rocks
rich
as
the
tapestry
of
a
florentine
palace
and
modifying
all
the
others
the
tinted
atmosphere
of
the
refracting
the
sun
through
the
infinitesimal
earth
motes
thrown
up
constantly
by
the
wind
devils
of
the
desert
drew
before
the
scene
a
delicate
and
gauzy
veil
of
lilac
of
rose
of
saffron
of
amethyst
or
of
mauve
according
to
the
time
of
day
senor
johnson
discovered
that
looking
at
the
landscape
upside
down
accentuated
the
colour
effects
it
amused
him
vastly
suddenly
to
bend
over
his
saddle
horn
the
top
of
his
head
nearly
touching
his
horse
mane
the
distant
mountains
at
once
started
out
into
redder
prominence
their
shadows
of
purple
deepened
to
the
royal
colour
the
rose
veil
thickened
she
the
prettiest
country
god
ever
made
exclaimed
senor
johnson
with
entire
conviction
and
no
matter
where
he
went
nor
into
how
familiar
country
he
rode
the
shapes
of
illusion
offered
always
variety
one
day
the
chiricahuas
were
a
tableland
next
day
a
series
of
castellated
peaks
now
an
anvil
now
a
saw
tooth
and
rarely
they
threw
a
magnificent
suspension
bridge
across
the
heavens
to
their
neighbours
the
ranges
on
the
west
lakes
rippling
in
the
wind
and
breaking
on
the
shore
cattle
big
as
elephants
or
small
as
rabbits
distances
that
did
not
exist
and
forests
that
never
were
beds
of
lava
along
the
hills
swearing
to
a
cloud
shadow
while
the
sky
was
polished
like
a
precious
stone
these
and
many
other
beautiful
and
marvellous
but
empty
shows
the
great
desert
displayed
lavishly
with
the
glitter
and
inconsequence
of
a
dream
senor
johnson
sat
on
his
horse
in
the
hot
sun
his
chin
in
his
band
his
elbow
on
the
pommel
watching
it
all
with
grave
unshifting
eyes
occasionally
belated
he
saw
the
stars
the
wonderful
desert
stars
blazing
clear
and
unflickering
like
the
flames
of
candles
or
the
moon
worked
her
necromancies
hemming
him
in
by
mountains
ten
thousand
feet
high
through
which
there
was
no
pass
and
then
as
he
rode
the
mountains
shifted
like
the
scenes
in
a
theatre
and
he
crossed
the
little
sand
dunes
out
from
the
dream
country
to
the
adobe
corrals
of
the
home
ranch
all
these
things
and
many
others
senor
johnson
now
saw
for
the
first
time
although
he
had
lived
among
them
for
twenty
years
it
struck
him
with
the
freshness
of
a
surprise
also
it
reacted
chemically
on
his
mental
processes
to
generate
a
new
power
within
him
the
new
power
being
as
yet
unapplied
made
him
uneasy
and
restless
and
a
little
irritable
he
tried
to
show
some
of
his
wonders
to
parker
jed
said
he
one
day
this
is
a
great
country
you
know
it
replied
the
foreman
those
tourists
in
their
pullmans
call
this
a
desert
desert
hell
look
at
them
flowers
the
foreman
cast
an
eye
on
a
glorious
silken
mantle
of
purple
a
hundred
yards
broad
sure
he
agreed
shows
what
we
could
do
if
we
only
had
a
little
water
and
again
jed
began
the
senor
did
you
ever
notice
them
mountains
sure
agreed
jed
ai
that
a
pretty
colour
you
bet
agreed
the
foreman
now
you
talking
i
always
said
they
was
mineralised
enough
to
make
a
good
prospect
this
was
unsatisfactory
senor
johnson
grew
more
restless
his
critical
eye
began
to
take
account
of
small
details
at
the
ranch
house
one
evening
he
on
a
sudden
bellowed
loudly
for
sang
the
chinese
servant
look
at
these
he
roared
when
sang
appeared
sang
eyes
opened
in
bewilderment
there
and
there
shouted
the
cattleman
look
at
them
old
newspapers
and
them
gun
rags
the
place
is
like
a
why
in
the
name
of
heaven
do
you
clean
up
here
allee
light
babbled
sang
i
clean
him
the
papers
and
gun
rags
had
lain
there
unnoticed
for
nearly
a
year
senor
johnson
kicked
them
savagely
it
time
we
took
a
brace
here
he
growled
we
livin
like
a
lot
of
oilers
oilers
greasers
mexicans
chapter
three
the
paper
a
year
old
sang
hurried
out
for
a
broom
senor
johnson
sat
where
he
was
his
heavy
square
brows
knit
suddenly
he
stooped
seized
one
of
the
newspapers
drew
near
the
lamp
and
began
to
read
it
was
a
kansas
city
paper
and
by
a
strange
coincidence
was
dated
exactly
a
year
before
the
sheet
senor
johnson
happened
to
pick
up
was
one
usually
passed
over
by
the
average
newspaper
reader
it
contained
only
columns
of
little
and
advertisements
classified
as
help
wanted
situations
wanted
lost
and
found
and
personal
the
latter
items
senor
johnson
commenced
to
read
while
awaiting
sang
and
the
broom
the
notices
were
five
in
number
the
first
three
were
of
the
mysterious
type
in
which
birdie
beseeches
jack
to
meet
her
at
the
fountain
the
fourth
advertised
a
clairvoyant
over
the
fifth
senor
johnson
paused
long
it
reads
an
intelligent
and
refined
lady
of
pleasing
appearance
correspondence
with
a
gentleman
of
means
object
matrimony
just
then
sang
returned
with
the
broom
and
began
noisily
to
sweep
together
the
debris
the
rustling
of
papers
aroused
senor
johnson
from
his
reverie
at
once
he
exploded
get
out
of
here
you
debased
mongolian
he
shouted
ca
you
see
i
reading
sang
fled
sorely
puzzled
for
the
senor
was
calm
and
unexcited
and
aloof
in
his
everyday
habit
soon
jed
parker
tall
wiry
deliberate
came
into
the
room
and
flung
his
broad
hat
and
spurs
into
the
corner
then
he
proceeded
to
light
his
pipe
and
threw
the
burned
match
on
the
floor
been
over
to
look
at
the
grant
pass
range
he
announced
cheerfully
she
no
good
drier
than
cork
legs
th
country
would
support
three
horned
toads
jed
quoth
the
senor
solemnly
i
wisht
you
hang
up
your
hat
like
i
have
it
do
look
good
there
on
the
floor
why
sure
agreed
jed
with
an
astonished
stare
sang
brought
in
supper
and
slung
it
on
the
red
and
white
squares
of
oilcloth
then
he
moved
the
lamp
and
retired
senor
johnson
gazed
with
distaste
into
his
cup
this
coffee
would
float
a
wedge
he
commented
sourly
she
no
puling
infant
agreed
the
cheerful
jed
and
this
went
on
the
senor
picking
up
what
purported
to
be
plum
duff
bog
down
a
few
currants
in
dough
and
call
her
pudding
he
ate
in
silence
then
pushed
back
his
chair
and
went
to
the
window
gazing
through
its
grimy
panes
at
the
mountains
ethereal
in
their
evening
saffron
blamed
chink
he
growled
why
do
he
wash
these
windows
jed
laid
down
his
busy
knife
and
idle
fork
to
gaze
on
his
chief
with
amazement
buck
johnson
the
austere
the
aloof
the
grimly
taciturn
the
dangerous
to
be
thus
complaining
like
a
querulous
woman
senor
said
he
you
off
your
feed
senor
johnson
strode
savagely
to
the
table
and
sat
down
with
a
bang
i
sick
of
it
he
growled
this
thing
will
kill
me
off
i
might
as
well
go
be
a
buck
nun
and
be
done
with
it
with
one
sweep
he
cleared
aside
the
dishes
give
me
that
pen
and
paper
behind
you
he
requested
for
an
hour
he
wrote
and
destroyed
the
floor
became
littered
with
torn
papers
then
he
enveloped
a
meagre
result
parker
had
watched
him
in
silence
the
senor
looked
up
to
catch
his
speculative
eye
his
own
eye
twinkled
a
little
but
the
twinkle
was
determined
and
sinister
with
only
an
alloy
of
humour
senor
ventured
parker
slowly
this
event
sure
knocks
me
and
crooked
if
the
loco
you
have
culled
has
paralysed
your
speaking
parts
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
in
the
name
of
heaven
hell
and
is
up
i
am
going
to
get
married
announced
the
senor
calmly
what
shouted
parker
who
to
to
a
lady
replied
the
senor
an
intelligent
and
refined
lady
of
pleasing
appearance
chapter
four
dreams
although
the
paper
was
a
year
old
senor
johnson
in
due
time
received
an
answer
from
kansas
a
correspondence
ensued
senor
johnson
enshrined
above
the
big
fireplace
the
photograph
of
a
woman
before
this
he
used
to
stand
for
hours
at
a
time
slowly
constructing
in
his
mind
what
he
had
hitherto
lacked
an
ideal
of
woman
and
of
home
this
ideal
he
used
sometimes
to
express
to
himself
and
to
the
ironical
jed
it
must
sure
be
nice
to
have
a
little
woman
waitin
for
you
when
you
come
in
the
desert
or
now
a
woman
would
have
them
windows
just
blooming
with
flowers
and
white
curtains
and
such
truck
or
i
bet
that
sang
would
get
a
wiggle
on
him
with
his
little
old
cleaning
duds
if
he
had
a
woman
ahold
of
his
jerk
line
slowly
he
reconstructed
his
life
the
life
of
the
ranch
in
terms
of
this
hypothesised
feminine
influence
then
matters
came
to
an
understanding
senor
johnson
had
sent
his
own
portrait
estrella
sands
wrote
back
that
she
adored
big
black
beards
but
she
was
afraid
of
him
he
had
such
a
fascinating
bad
eye
no
woman
could
resist
him
senor
johnson
at
once
took
things
for
granted
sent
on
to
kansas
a
preposterous
sum
of
expense
money
and
a
railroad
ticket
and
raided
goodrich
store
at
willets
a
hundred
miles
away
for
all
manner
of
gaudy
carpets
silverware
fancy
lamps
works
of
art
pianos
linen
and
gimcracks
for
the
adornment
of
the
ranch
house
furthermore
he
offered
wages
more
than
equal
to
a
hundred
miles
of
desert
to
a
young
irish
girl
named
susie
to
come
out
as
housekeeper
decorator
boss
of
sang
and
another
chinaman
and
companion
to
johnson
when
she
should
arrive
furthermore
he
laid
off
from
the
range
work
brent
palmer
the
most
skilful
man
with
horses
and
set
him
to
gentling
a
beautiful
little
sorrel
a
sidesaddle
had
arrived
from
el
paso
it
was
centre
fire
which
is
to
say
it
had
but
the
single
horsehair
cinch
broad
tasselled
very
genteel
in
its
suggestion
of
pleasure
use
only
brent
could
be
seen
at
all
times
of
day
cantering
here
and
there
on
the
sorrel
a
blanket
tied
around
his
waist
to
simulate
the
long
riding
skirt
he
carried
also
a
sulky
and
evil
gleam
in
his
eye
warning
against
undue
levity
jed
parker
watched
these
various
proceedings
sardonically
once
the
baby
light
of
innocence
blue
in
his
eye
he
inquired
if
he
would
be
required
to
dress
for
dinner
if
so
he
went
on
i
have
my
man
brush
up
my
clothes
but
senor
johnson
refused
to
be
baited
go
on
jed
said
he
you
know
you
ai
got
clothes
enough
to
dust
a
fiddle
the
senor
was
happy
these
days
he
showed
it
by
an
unwonted
joviality
of
spirit
by
a
slight
but
evident
unbending
of
his
spanish
dignity
no
longer
did
the
splendour
of
the
desert
fill
him
with
a
vague
yearning
and
uneasiness
he
looked
upon
it
confidently
noting
its
various
phases
with
care
rejoicing
in
each
new
development
of
colour
and
light
of
form
and
illusion
storing
them
away
in
his
memory
so
that
their
recurrence
should
find
him
prepared
to
recognise
and
explain
them
for
soon
he
would
have
someone
by
his
side
with
whom
to
appreciate
them
in
that
sharing
he
could
see
the
reason
for
them
the
reason
for
their
strange
effects
on
the
human
soul
one
evening
he
leaned
on
the
corral
fence
looking
toward
the
dragoons
the
sun
had
set
behind
them
gigantic
they
loomed
against
the
western
light
from
their
summits
like
an
aureola
radiated
the
splendour
of
the
air
this
evening
a
deep
umber
a
faint
reflection
of
it
fell
across
the
desert
glorifying
the
reaches
of
its
nothingness
i
take
her
out
on
an
evening
like
this
quoth
senor
johnson
to
himself
and
i
make
her
keep
her
eyes
on
the
ground
till
we
get
right
up
by
running
bear
knob
and
then
i
let
her
look
up
all
to
once
and
she
surely
enjoy
this
life
i
bet
she
never
saw
a
steer
roped
in
her
life
she
can
ride
with
me
every
day
out
over
the
range
and
i
show
her
the
busting
and
the
branding
and
that
band
of
antelope
over
by
the
tall
windmill
i
teach
her
to
shoot
too
and
we
can
make
little
pack
trips
off
in
the
hills
when
she
gets
too
hot
up
there
by
deerskin
meadows
the
high
peaks
he
mused
turning
over
in
his
mind
a
new
picture
of
his
own
life
aims
and
pursuits
as
modified
by
the
sympathetic
and
understanding
companionship
of
a
woman
he
pictured
himself
as
he
must
seem
to
her
in
his
different
pursuits
the
picturesqueness
pleased
him
the
simple
direct
vanity
of
the
man
the
wholesome
vanity
of
a
straightforward
nature
awakened
to
preen
its
feathers
before
the
idea
of
the
mate
the
shadows
fell
over
the
chiricahuas
flared
the

the
weird
lucence

parker
coming
out
from
the
adobe
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
rail
in
silent
company
with
his
chief
he
too
looked
abroad
his
mind
eye
saw
what
his
body
eye
had
always
told
him
were
the
insistent
notes
the
alkali
the
cactus
the
sage
the
mesquite
the
lava
the
choking
dust
the
blinding
beat
the
burning
thirst
he
sighed
in
the
dim
half
recollection
of
past
days
i
wonder
if
she
like
the
country
he
hazarded
but
senor
johnson
turned
on
him
his
steady
eyes
filled
with
the
great
glory
of
the
desert
like
the
country
he
marvelled
slowly
of
course
why
she
chapter
five
the
arrival
the
overland
drew
into
willets
coated
from
engine
to
observation
with
white
dust
a
porter
in
strange
contrast
of
neatness
flung
open
the
vestibule
dropped
his
little
carpeted
step
and
turned
to
assist
someone
a
few
idle
passengers
gazed
out
on
the
uninteresting
flat
frontier
town
senor
johnson
caught
his
breath
in
amazement
god
ai
she
just
like
her
picture
he
exclaimed
he
seemed
to
find
this
astonishing
for
a
moment
he
did
not
step
forward
to
claim
her
so
she
stood
looking
about
her
uncertainly
her
leather
at
her
feet
she
was
indeed
like
the
photograph
the
same
compact
little
figure
the
same
round
face
the
same
cupid
bow
mouth
the
same
appealing
large
eyes
the
same
haze
of
doll
hair
in
a
moment
she
caught
sight
of
senor
johnson
and
took
two
steps
toward
him
then
stopped
the
senor
at
once
came
forward
you
johnson
ai
you
she
inquired
thrusting
her
little
pointed
chin
forward
and
so
elevating
her
eyes
to
his
yes
he
acknowledged
formally
then
after
a
moment
pause
i
hope
you
well
yes
thank
you
the
station
loungers
augmented
by
all
the
ranchmen
and
cowboys
in
town
were
examining
her
closely
she
looked
at
them
in
a
swift
side
glance
that
seemed
to
gather
all
their
eyes
to
hers
then
satisfied
that
she
possessed
the
universal
admiration
she
returned
the
full
force
of
her
attention
to
the
man
before
her
now
you
give
me
your
trunk
checks
he
was
saying
and
then
we
go
right
over
and
get
married
oh
she
gasped
that
right
ai
it
he
demanded
yes
i
suppose
so
she
agreed
faintly
a
little
subdued
she
followed
him
to
the
clergyman
house
where
in
the
presence
of
goodrich
the
storekeeper
and
the
preacher
wife
the
two
were
united
then
they
mounted
the
buckboard
and
drove
from
town
senor
johnson
said
nothing
because
he
knew
of
nothing
to
say
he
drove
skilfully
and
fast
through
the
gathering
dusk
it
was
a
hundred
miles
to
the
home
ranch
and
that
hundred
miles
by
means
of
five
relays
of
horses
already
arranged
for
they
would
cover
by
morning
thus
they
would
avoid
the
dust
and
heat
and
high
winds
of
the
day
the
sweet
night
fell
the
little
desert
winds
laid
soft
fingers
on
their
checks
overhead
burned
the
stars
clear
unflickering
like
candles
dimly
could
be
seen
the
horses
their
flanks
swinging
steadily
in
the
square
trot
ghostly
bushes
passed
them
ghostly
rock
elevations
far
in
indeterminate
distance
lay
the
outlines
of
the
mountains
always
they
seemed
to
recede
the
plain
all
but
invisible
the
wagon
trail
quite
so
the
depths
of
space
these
flung
heavy
on
the
soul
their
weight
of
mysticism
the
woman
until
now
bolt
upright
in
the
buckboard
seat
shrank
nearer
to
the
man
he
felt
against
his
sleeve
the
delicate
contact
of
her
garment
and
thrilled
to
the
touch
a
coyote
barked
sharply
from
a
neighbouring
eminence
then
trailed
off
into
the
shrill
howl
of
his
species
what
was
that
she
asked
quickly
in
a
subdued
voice
a
coyote
one
of
them
little
wolves
he
explained
the
horses
hoofs
rang
clear
on
a
hardened
bit
of
the
alkali
crust
then
dully
as
they
encountered
again
the
dust
of
the
plain
vast
vague
mysterious
in
the
silence
of
night
filled
with
strange
influences
breathing
through
space
like
damp
winds
the
desert
took
them
to
the
heart
of
her
great
spaces
buck
she
whispered
a
little
tremblingly
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
spoken
his
name
what
is
it
he
asked
a
new
note
in
his
voice
but
for
a
time
she
did
not
reply
only
the
contact
against
his
sleeve
increased
by
ever
so
little
buck
she
repeated
then
all
in
a
rush
and
with
a
sob
oh
afraid
tenderly
the
man
drew
her
to
him
her
head
fell
against
his
shoulder
and
she
hid
her
eyes
there
little
girl
he
reassured
her
his
big
voice
rich
and
musical
there
nothing
to
get
scairt
of
i
take
care
of
you
what
frightens
you
honey
she
nestled
close
in
his
arm
with
a
sigh
of
half
relief
i
do
know
she
laughed
but
still
with
a
tremble
in
her
tones
it
all
so
big
and
lonesome
and
strange
and
i
so
little
there
little
girl
he
repeated
they
drove
on
and
on
at
the
end
of
two
hours
they
stopped
men
with
lanterns
dazzled
their
eyes
the
horses
were
changed
and
so
out
again
into
the
night
where
the
desert
seemed
to
breathe
in
deep
mysterious
exhalations
like
a
sleeping
beast
senor
johnson
drove
his
horses
masterfully
with
his
one
free
hand
the
road
did
not
exist
except
to
his
trained
eyes
they
seemed
to
be
swimming
out
out
into
a
vapour
of
night
with
the
wind
of
their
going
steady
against
their
faces
buck
she
murmured
i
so
tired
he
tightened
his
arm
around
her
and
she
went
to
sleep
at
the
ranches
where
the
relays
waited
dozing
again
as
soon
as
the
lanterns
dropped
behind
and
senor
johnson
alone
with
his
horses
and
the
solemn
stars
drove
on
ever
on
into
the
desert
by
grey
of
the
early
summer
dawn
they
arrived
the
girl
wakened
descended
smiling
uncertainly
at
susie
blinking
somnolently
at
her
surroundings
susie
put
her
to
bed
in
the
little
southwest
room
where
hung
the
shiny
colt
in
its
worn
leather
holster
she
murmured
incoherent
thanks
and
sank
again
to
sleep
overcome
by
the
fatigue
of
unaccustomed
travelling
by
the
potency
of
the
desert
air
by
the
excitement
of
anticipation
to
which
her
nerves
had
long
been
strung
senor
johnson
did
not
sleep
he
was
tough
and
used
to
it
he
lit
a
cigar
and
rambled
about
now
reading
the
newspapers
he
had
brought
with
him
now
prowling
softly
about
the
building
now
visiting
the
corrals
and

him
and
came

forbade
him

and
himself
roused

on
senor

a
dozen
times
to
the
bedroom

he
ventured
to
push
it
open
he
looked
long
within
then
shut
it
softly
and
tiptoed
out
into
the
open

said
to
his

it
made

feel
to

lying
there
so
pink
and
soft
and
pretty
with
her
yaller
hair
all
tumbled
about
and
a
little
smile
on
her
there
in

old
bed
with
my
old
gun
hanging
over
her

way

about
noon
she
emerged
from
the
room
fully
refreshed
and
wide
awake
she
and
susie
had
unpacked
at
least
one
of
the
trunks
and
now
she
stood
arrayed
in
shirtwaist
and
blue
skirt
at
once
she
stepped
into
the
open
air
and
looked
about
her
with
considerable
curiosity
so
this
is
a
real
cattle
ranch
was
her
comment
senor
johnson
was
at
her
side
pressing
on
her
with
boyish
eagerness
the
sights
of
the
place
she
patted
the
stag
hounds
and
inspected
the
garden
then
confessing
herself
hungry
she
obeyed
with
alacrity
sang
call
to
an
early
meal
at
the
table
she
ate
coquettishly
throwing
her
birdlike
side
glances
at
the

announced
as

joyously
sang

in
here
a
minute
after
an
interval
the
cowboy
appeared
mincing
in
on
his
boots
his
silver
spurs
jingling
the
fringe
of
his
chaps
impacting
softly
on
the
leather
he
stood
at
ease

broad
hat
in
both

they
went
out
toward
the

the
cowboy
joining
them
as
a
matter
of
course
estrella
demanded
explanations
as
she
went
along
their
progress
was
leisurely
the
blindfolded
pump
mule
interested
her
and
he
goes
round
and
round
that
way
all

without
stopping
thinking

marvelled

approached

the

head
with
every
symptom
of
distrust
she
forgot
the
sugar
she
had
intended
to

young

smooth

the

directly
i
just
tacking

on

here
we
all

our

his
roving
eye
examined
her
countenance
respectfully
but
with
admiration
she
caught
the
admiration
and
returned
it
covertly
but
unmistakably
pleased
that
her
charms
were
appreciated
they
continued
their
rounds
the
sun
was
very
hot
and
the
dust
deep
a
woman
would
have
known
that
these
things
distressed
estrella
she
picked
her
way
through
the
debris
she
dropped
her
head
from
the
burning
she
felt
her
delicate
garments
moistening
with
perspiration
her
hair
dampening
the
dust
sifted
up
through
the
air
over
in
the
large
corral
a
bronco
buster
assisted
by
two
of
the
cowboys
was
engaged
in
roping
and
throwing
some
wild
mustangs
the
sight
was
wonderful
but
here
the
dust
billowed
in
clouds
i
getting
a
little
hot
and
tired
she
confessed
at
last
i
think
i
go
to
the
house
but
near
the
shed
she
stopped
again
interested
in
spite
of
herself
by
a
bit
of
repairing
tommy
had
under
way
the
tire
of
a
wagon
wheel
had
been
destroyed
tommy
was
mending
it
on
the
ground
lay
a
fresh
cowhide
from
this
tommy
was
cutting
a
wide
strip
as
she
watched
he
measured
the
strip
around
the
circumference
of
the
wheel
he
is
going
to
make
a
tire
of
that
she
exclaimed
incredulously
sure
replied
senor
johnson
will
it
wear
it
wear
for
a
month
or
so
till
we
can
get
another
from

estrella
advanced
and
felt
curiously
of
the
rawhide
tommy
was
fastening
it
to
the
wheel
at
the
ends
only
but
how
can
it
stay
on
that
way
she
objected
it
come
right
off
as
soon
as
you
use
it
it
harden
on
tight
enough
why
she
persisted
does
it
shrink
much
when
it
dries
senor
johnson
stared
to
see
if
she
might
be
joking
does
it
shrink
he
repeated
slowly
there
ai
nothing
shrinks
more
nor
harder
it
mighty
nigh
break
that
wood
estrella
incredulous
interested
she
could
not
have
told
why
stooped
again
to
feel
the
soft
yielding
hide
she
shook
her
head
you
joking
me
because
i
a
tenderfoot
she
accused
brightly
i
know
it
dries
hard
and
i
believe
it
shrinks
a
lot
but
to
break
wood
that
piling
it
on
a
little
thick
no
that
right
broke
in
brent

it
awful
strong
it
pulls
like
a
horse
when
the
desert
sun
gets
on
it
you
wrap
anything
up
in
a
piece
of
that
hide
and
see
what
happens
some
time
you
take
and
wrap
a
piece
around
a
potato
and
put
her
out
in
the
sun
and
see
how
it
squeeze
the
water
out
of
her

that
so
she
appealed
to
tommy
i
ca
tell
when
they
are
making
fun
of
me
yes
that
right
he
assured
her
estrella
passed
a
strip
of
the
flexible
hide
playfully
about
her
wrists
and
if
i
let
that
dry
that
way
i
be
handcuffed
hard
and
fast
she
said
it
would
cut
you
down
to
the
bone
supplemented
brent
palmer
she
untwisted
the
strip
and
stood
looking
at
it
her
eyes
wide
i
i
do
know
why
she
faltered
the
thought
makes
me
a
little
sick
why
is
it
queer
ugh
it
like
a

she
flung
it
from
her
energetically
and

he
acknowledged
them
right
and
proper
course
she
do
want
to
ride
over
to
circle
i
with
us
he
informed
his
confidant
jed
parker
it
a
long
ride
and
she
ai
used
to
riding
yet
trouble
is
i
been
thinking
of
doing
things
with
her
just
as
if
she
was
a
man
women
are
different
they
likes
different
things
this
second
idea
gradually
overlaid
the
first
in
senor
johnson
mind
estrella
showed
little
aptitude
or
interest
in
the
rougher
side
of
life
her
husband
statement
as
to
her
being
still
unused
to
riding
was
distinctly
a
euphemism
estrella
never
arrived
at
the
point
of
feeling
safe
on
a
horse
in
time
she
gave
up
trying
and
the
sorrel
drifted
back
to
the
range
work
she
never
understood
as
a
spectacle
it
imposed
itself
on
her
interest
for
a
week
but
since
she
could
discover
no
real
and
vital
concern
in
the
welfare
of
cows
soon
the
mere
outward
show
became
an
old
story
estrella
sleek
nature
avoided
instinctively
all
that
interfered
with
bodily
when
she
was
cool
and
and
not
thirsty
and
surrounded
by
a
proper
degree
of
feminine
daintiness
then
she
was
ready
to
amuse
herself
but
she
could
not
understand
the
desirability
of
those
pleasures
for
which
a
certain
price
in
discomfort
must
be
paid
as
for
firearms
she
confessed
herself
frankly
afraid
of
them
that
was
the
point
at
which
her
intimacy
with
them
stopped
the
natural
level
to
which
these
waters
fell
is
easily
seen
quite
simply
the
senor
found
that
a
wife
does
not
enter
fully
into
her
husband
workaday
life
the
dreams
he
had
dreamed
did
not
come
true
this
was
at
first
a
disappointment
to
him
of
course
but
the
disappointment
did
not
last
senor
johnson
was
a
man
of
sense
and
he
easily
modified
his
first
scheme
of
married
life
she
get
sick
of
it
and
i
get
sick
of
it
he
formulated
his
new
philosophy
now
i
got
something
to
come
back
to
somebody
to
look
forward
to
and
it
a
woman
it
ai
one
of
these
darn
cowgirls
the
great
thing
is
to
feel
you
belong
to
someone
and
that
someone
nice
and
cool
and
fresh
and
purty
is
waitin
for
you
when
you
come
in
tired
it
beats
that
other
little
old
idee
of
mine
slick
as
a
gun
barrel
so
during
this
the
busy
season
of
the
range
riding
immediately
before
the
great
fall
senor
johnson
rode
abroad
all
day
and
returned
to
his
own
hearth
as
many
evenings
of
the
week
as
he
could
estrella
always
saw
him
coming
and
stood
in
the
doorway
to
greet
him
he
kicked
off
his
spurs
washed
and
dusted
himself
and
spent
the
evening
with
his
wife
he
liked
the
sound
of
exactly
that
phrase
and
was
fond
of
repeating
it
to
himself
in
a
variety
of
connections
when
i
get
in
i
spend
the
evening
with
my
wife
if
i
do
ride
over
to
circle
i
i
spend
the
evening
with
my
wife
and
so
on
he
had
a
good
deal
to
tell
her
of
the
day
discoveries
the
state
of
the
range
and
the
condition
of
the
cattle
to
all
of
this
she
listened
at
least
with
patience
senor
johnson
like
most
men
who
have
long
delayed
marriage
was
without
knowing
it
his
interest
in
his
mate
had
to
do
with
her
personality
rather
than
with
her
doings
what
you
do
with
yourself
all
day
he
occasionally
inquired
oh
there
lots
to
do
she
would
answer
a
trifle
listlessly
and
this
reply
always
seemed
quite
to
satisfy
his
interest
in
the
subject
senor
johnson
with
a
curiously
instant
transformation
often
to
be
observed
among
the
adventurous
settled
luxuriously
into
the
state
of
being
a
married
man
its
smallest
details
gave
him
distinct
and
separate
sensations
of
pleasure
i
plumb
likes
it
all
he
said
i
likes
havin
interest
in
some
fool
geranium
plant
and
i
likes
worryin
about
the
screen
doors
and
all
the
rest
of
the
plumb
foolishness
it
does
me
good
it
feels
like
stretchin
your
legs
in
front
of
a
good
warm
fire
the
centre
the
compelling
influence
of
this
new
state
of
affairs
was
undoubtedly
estrella
and
yet
it
is
equally
to
be
doubted
whether
she
stood
for
more
than
the
suggestion
senor
johnson
conducted
his
entire
life
with
reference
to
his
wife
his
waking
hours
were
concerned
only
with
the
thought
of
her
his
every
act
revolved
in
its
orbit
controlled
by
her
influence
nevertheless
she
as
an
individual
human
being
had
little
to
do
with
it
senor
johnson
referred
his
life
to
a
state
of
affairs
he
had
himself
invented
and
which
he
called
the
married
state
and
to
a
woman
whose
attitude
he
had
himself
determined
upon
and
whom
he
designated
as
his
wife
the
actual
state
of
affairs
whatever
it
might
be
he
did
not
see
and
the
actual
woman
supplied
merely
the
material
medium
necessary
to
the
reality
of
his
idea
whether
estrella
eyes
were
interested
or
bored
bright
or
dull
alert
or
abstracted
contented
or
afraid
senor
johnson
could
not
have
told
you
he
might
have
replied
promptly
enough
that
they
were
happy
and
loving
that
is
the
way
senor
johnson
conceived
a
wife
eyes
the
routine
of
life
then
soon
settled
after
breakfast
the
senor
insisted
that
his
wife
accompany
him
on
a
short
tour
of
inspection
a
little
pasear
he
called
it
just
to
get
set
for
the
day
then
his
horse
was
brought
and
he
rode
away
on
whatever
business
called
him
like
a
true
son
of
the
alkali
he
took
no
lunch
with
him
nor
expected
his
horse
to
feed
until
his
return
this
was
an
hour
before
sunset
the
evening
passed
as
has
been
described
it
was
all
very
simple
when
the
business
hung
close
to
the
ranch
house
as
in
the
bronco
busting
the
rebranding
of
bought
cattle
and
the
like
he
was
able
to
share
his
wife
day
estrella
conducted
herself
dreamily
with
a
slow
smile
for
him
when
his
actual
presence
insisted
on
her
attention
she
seemed
much
given
to
staring
out
over
the
desert
senor
johnson
appreciatively
thought
he
could
understand
this
again
she
gave
much
leisure
to
rocking
back
and
forth
on
the
low
wide
veranda
her
hands
idle
her
eyes
vacant
her
lips
dumb
susie
had
early
proved
incompatible
and
had
gone
a
nice
contented
home
sort
of
a
woman
said
senor
johnson
one
thing
alone
besides
the
deserts
on
which
she
never
seemed
tired
of
looking
fascinated
her
whenever
a
beef
was
killed
for
the
uses
of
the
ranch
she
commanded
strips
of
the
green
skin
then
like
a
child
she
bound
them
and
sewed
them
and
nailed
them
to
substances
particularly
susceptible
to
their
constricting
power
she
choked
the
necks
of
green
gourds
she
indented
the
tender
bark
of
cottonwood
shoots
she
expended
an
apparently
exhaustless
ingenuity
on
the
fabrication
of
mechanical
devices
whose
principle
answered
to
the
pulling
of
the
drying
rawhide
and
always
along
the
adobe
fence
could
be
seen
a
long
row
of
potatoes
bound
in
skin
some
of
them
fresh
and
smooth
and
round
some
sweating
in
the
agony
of
squeezing
some
wrinkled
and
dry
and
little
the
last
drops
of
life
tortured
out
of
them
senor
johnson
laughed
at
these
toys
puzzled
to
explain
their
fascination
for
his
wife
they
sure
an
amusing
enough
contraption
honey
said
he
but
what
makes
you
stand
out
there
in
the
hot
sun
staring
at
them
that
way
it
cooler
on
the
porch
i
do
know
said
estrella
helplessly
turning
her
slow
vacant
gaze
on
him
suddenly
she
shivered
in
a
strong
physical
revulsion
i
do
know
she
cried
with
passion
after
they
had
been
married
about
a
month
senor
johnson
found
it
necessary
to
drive
into
willets
how
would
you
like
to
go
too
and
buy
some
duds
he
asked
estrella
oh
she
cried
strangely
when
day
after
tomorrow
the
trip
decided
her
entire
attitude
changed
the
vacancy
of
her
gaze
lifted
her
movements
quickened
she
left
off
staring
at
the
desert
and
her
rawhide
toys
were
neglected
before
starting
senor
johnson
gave
her
a
check
book
he
explained
that
there
were
no
banks
in
willets
but
that
goodrich
the
storekeeper
would
honour
her
signature
buy
what
you
want
to
honey
said
he
tear
her
wide
open
i
good
for
it
how
much
can
i
draw
she
asked
smiling
as
much
as
you
want
to
he
replied
with
emphasis
take
care
she
poised
before
him
with
the
check
book
extended
i
may
draw
i
might
draw
fifty
thousand
dollars
not
out
of
goodrich
he
grinned
you
bust
the
game
but
hold
him
up
for
the
limit
anyway
he
chuckled
aloud
pleased
at
the
rare
coquetry
of
the
woman
they
drove
to
willets
it
took
them
two
days
to
go
and
two
days
to
return
estrella
went
through
the
town
in
a
cyclone
burst
of
enthusiasm
saw
everything
bought
everything
exhausted
everything
in
two
hours
willets
was
not
a
large
place
on
her
return
to
the
ranch
she
sat
down
at
once
in
the
on
the
veranda
her
hands
fell
into
her
lap
she
stared
out
over
the
desert
senor
johnson
stole
up
behind
her
clumsy
as
a
playful
bear
his
eyes
followed
the
direction
of
hers
to
where
a
cloud
shadow
lay
across
the
slope
heavy
palpable
untransparent
like
a
blotch
of
ink
pretty
is
it
honey
said
he
glad
to
get
back
she
smiled
at
him
her
vacant
slow
smile
here
my
check
book
she
said
put
it
away
for
me
i
through
with
it
i
put
it
in
my
desk
said
he
it
in
the
cubbyhole
he
called
from
inside
very
well
she
replied
he
stood
in
the
doorway
looking
fondly
at
her
unconscious
shoulders
and
the
pose
of
her
blonde
head
thrown
back
against
the
high
that
the
sort
of
a
woman
after
all
said
senor
johnson
no
blame
fuss
about
her
chapter
eight
the
this
as
you
well
may
gather
was
in
the
summer
routine
now
the
time
of
the
great
fall
drew
near
the
home
ranch
began
to
bustle
in
preparation
all
through
cochise
county
were
short
mountain
ranges
set
down
apparently
at
random
like
a
child
blocks
in
and
out
between
them
flowed
the
broad
valleys
on
the
valleys
were
the
various
ranges
great
or
small
controlled
by
the
different
individuals
of
the
cattlemen
association
during
the
year
an
unimportant
but
certain
shifting
of
stock
took
place
a
few
cattle
of
senor
johnson
lazy
y
eluded
the
vigilance
of
his
riders
to
drift
over
through
the
grant
pass
and
into
the
ranges
of
his
neighbour
equally
many
of
the
steers
watered
daily
at
senor
johnson
troughs
it
was
a
matter
of
courtesy
to
permit
this
but
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
fall
was
a
redistribution
to
the
proper
ranges
each
sent
an
outfit
to
the
scene
of
labour
the
combined
outfits
moved
slowly
from
one
valley
to
another
cutting
out
the
strays
branding
the
late
calves
collecting
for
the
owner
of
that
particular
range
all
his
stock
that
he
might
select
his
marketable
beef
in
turn
each
cattleman
was
host
to
his
neighbours
and
their
men
this
year
it
had
been
decided
to
begin
the
circle
of
the
at
the
c
bar
near
the
banks
of
the
san
pedro
thence
it
would
work
eastward
wandering
slowly
in
north
and
south
deviation
to
include
all
the
country
until
the
final
would
occur
at
the
lazy
y
the
lazy
y
crew
was
to
consist
of
four
men
thirty
riding
horses
a
chuck
wagon
and
cook
these
helping
others
and
receiving
help
in
turn
would
suffice
for
in
the
labour
was
pooled
to
a
common
end
with
them
would
ride
jed
parker
to
safeguard
his
interests
for
a
week
the
punchers
in
their
daily
rides
gathered
in
the
range
ponies
senor
johnson
owned
fifty
horses
which
he
maintained
at
the
home
ranch
for
riding
two
hundred
broken
saddle
animals
allowed
the
freedom
of
the
range
except
when
special
occasion
demanded
their
use
and
perhaps
half
a
thousand
quite
unbroken
brood
mares
stallions
young
horses
broncos
and
the
like
at
this
time
of
year
it
was
his
habit
to
corral
all
those
saddlewise
in
order
to
select
horses
for
the
and
to
replace
the
ranch
animals
the
latter
he
turned
loose
for
their
turn
at
the
freedom
of
the
range
the
horses
chosen
next
the
men
turned
their
attention
to
outfit
each
had
of
course
his
saddle
spurs
and
rope
of
the
latter
the
chuck
wagon
carried
many
extra
that
vehicle
furthermore
transported
such
articles
as
the
blankets
the
tarpaulins
under
which
to
sleep
the
running
irons
for
branding
the
cooking
layout
and
the
men
personal
effects
all
was
in
readiness
to
move
for
the
six
weeks
circle
when
a
complication
arose
jed
parker
while
nimbly
escaping
an
irritated
steer
twisted
the
high
heel
of
his
boot
on
the
corral
fence
he
insisted
the
injury
amounted
to
nothing
senor
johnson
however
disagreed
it
do
amount
to
nothing
jed
he
pronounced
after
manipulation
but
she
might
make
a
good
injury
with
a
little
coaxing
rest
her
a
week
and
then
you
be
all
right
rest
her
the
devil
growled
jed
who
going
to
san
pedro
i
will
of
course
replied
the
senor
promptly
didje
think
we
send
the
chink
i
was
first
cousin
to
a
yaqui
jackass
for
sendin
young
billy
ellis

the
president

senor
pointed

some
experience
i
hate
to
have
you

go
objected
jed
there
the
missis
he
shot
a
glance
sideways
at
his
chief
i
guess

i

it
for
a
week

the
latter
why

now
besides
you
can
take
care
of
her

jed
parker
a
little
grimly
chapter
nine
the
long
trail
the
crew
started
early
the
next
morning
just
about
senor
johnson
rode
first
merely
to
keep
out
of
the
dust
then
followed
torn
rich
jogging
along
easily
in
the
spanish
trot
whistling
soothingly
to
quiet
the
horses
giving
a
lead
to
the
band
of
saddle
animals
strung
out
loosely
behind
him
these
moved
on
gracefully
and
lightly
in
the
manner
of
the
unburdened
plains
horse
half
decided
to
follow
tom
guidance
half
inclined
to
break
to
right
or
left
homer
and
jim
lester
flanked
them
also
riding
in
a
slouch
of
apparent
laziness
but
every
once
in
a
while
darting
forward
like
bullets
to
turn
back
into
the
main
herd
certain
individuals
whom
the
early
morning
of
the
unwearied
day
had
inspired
to
make
a
dash
for
liberty
the
rear
was
brought
up
by
jerky
jones
the
fourth
and
the
chuck
wagon
lost
in
its
own
dust
the
sun
mounted
the
desert
went
silently
through
its
changes
wind
devils
raised
straight
true
columns
of
dust
six
eight
hundred
even
a
thousand
feet
into
the
air
the
billows
of
dust
from
the
horses
and
men
crept
and
crawled
with
them
like
a
living
creature
glorious
colour
magnificent
distance
astonishing
illusion
filled
the
world
senor
johnson
rode
ahead
looking
at
these
things
the
separation
from
his
wife
brief
as
it
would
be
left
room
in
his
soul
for
the
which
beauty
arouses
in
men
he
loved
the
charm
of
the
desert
yet
it
hurt
him
behind
him
the
punchers
relieved
the
tedium
of
the
march
each
after
his
own
manner
in
an
hour
the
bunch
of
loose
horses
lost
its
good
spirits
and
settled
down
to
a
steady
plodding
that
needed
no
supervision
tom
rich
led
them
now
in
silence
his
time
fully
occupied
in
rolling
mexican
cigarettes
with
one
hand
the
other
three
dropped
back
together
and
exchanged
desultory
remarks
occasionally
jim
lester
sang
it
was
always
the
same
song
of
uncounted
verses
but
jim
had
a
strange
fashion
of
singing
a
single
verse
at
a
time
after
a
long
interval
he
would
sing
another
my
love
is
a
rider
and
broncos
he
breaks
but
he
given
up
riding
and
all
for
my
sake
for
he
found
him
a
horse
and
it
suited
him
so
that
he
vowed
he
ride
any
other
bronco
he
warbled
and
then
in
the
same
breath
say
boys
did
you
get
onto
the
shorthorn
at
willets
last
week
nope
he
sifted
in
wearin
one
of
these
hardboiled
hats
and
carryin
a
brogue
thick
enough
to
skate
on
says
he
wants
a
job
team
that
he
drives
a
truck
plenty
back
to
louis
where
he
comes
from
goodrich
sets
him
behind
them
little
pinto
cavallos
he
has
say
that
son
of
a
gun
a
driver
he
could
drive
nails
in
a
snow
bank
an
expressive
gesture
told
all
there
was
to
tell
of
the
runaway
th
shorthorn
landed
headfirst
in
goldfish
horse
trough
charlie
fishes
him
out
the
devil
stranger
says
charlie
you
come
to
fall
in
here
blamed
fool
says
the
shorthorn
just
cryin
mad
did
come
to
fall
in
here
i
come
to
drive
horses
and
then
without
a
transitory
pause
oh
my
love
has
a
gun
and
that
gun
he
can
use
but
he
quit
his
gun
fighting
as
well
as
his
booze
and
he
sold
him
his
saddle
his
spurs
and
his
rope
and
there
no
more
and
that
what
i
hope
the
alkali
dust
swirled
back
by
a
little
breeze
billowed
up
and
choked
him
behind
the
mules
coughed
their
coats
whitening
with
the
powder
far
ahead
in
the
distance
lay
the
westerly
mountains
they
looked
an
hour
away
and
yet
every
man
and
beast
in
the
outfit
knew
that
hour
after
hour
they
were
doomed
by
the
enchantment
of
the
land
to
plod
ahead
without
apparently
getting
an
inch
nearer
the
only
salvation
was
to
forget
the
mountains
and
to
fill
the
present
moment
full
of
little
things
but
senor
johnson
found
himself
unable
to
do
this
in
spite
of
his
best
efforts
he
caught
himself
straining
toward
the
distant
goal
becoming
impatient
trying
to
measure
progress
by
landmarks
in
short
acting
like
a
tenderfoot
on
the
desert
who
wears
himself
down
and
dies
not
from
the
hardship
but
from
the
nervous
strain
which
he
does
not
know
how
to
avoid
senor
johnson
knew
this
as
well
as
you
and
i
he
cursed
himself
vigorously
and
began
with
great
resolution
to
think
of
something
else
he
was
aroused
from
this
by
tom
rich
riding
alongside
somebody
coming
senor
said
he
senor
johnson
raised
his
eyes
to
the
approaching
cloud
of
dust
silently
the
two
watched
it
until
it
resolved
into
a
rider
loping
easily
along
in
fifteen
minutes
he
drew
rein
his
pony
dropped
immediately
from
a
gallop
to
immobility
he
swung
into
a
graceful
attitude
across
his
saddle
grinned
amiably
and
began
to
roll
a
cigarette
billy
ellis
cried
rich
that

the
newcomer
thought

were
down
to
tucson

billy
ellis
dreamily
when

to
tucson
next

watch
out
until
you
sees
a
little
britisher
take
a
look
at
him
then

senor
johnson

goes
all
right
well
so
long
so
long
senor
they
moved
the
erratic
arizona
breezes
twisted
the
dust
of
their
going
senor
johnson
watched
them
dwindle
with
them
seemed
to
go
the
joy
in
the
old
life
no
longer
did
the
long
trail
possess
for
him
its
ancient
fascination
he
had
become
a
domestic
man
and
i
glad
of
it
commented
senor
johnson
the
dust
eddied
aside
plainly
could
be
seen
the
swaying
wagon
the
cowboys
the
gleaming
naked
backs
of
the
herd
then
the
veil
closed
over
them
again
but
down
the
wind
faintly
in
snatches
came
the
words
of
jim
lester
song
oh
sam
has
a
gun
that
has
gone
to
the
bad
which
makes
poor
old
sammy
feel
pretty
damn
sad
for
that
gun
it
shoots
high
and
that
gun
it
shoots
low
and
it
wabbles
about
like
a
bucking
bronco
senor
johnson
turned
and
struck
spurs
to
his
willing
pony
chapter
ten
the
discovery
senor
buck
johnson
loped
quickly
back
toward
the
home
ranch
his
heart
glad
at
this
fortunate
solution
of
his
annoyance
the
home
ranch
lay
in
plain
sight
not
ten
miles
away
as
senor
johnson
idly
watched
it
shimmering
in
the
heat
a
tiny
figure
detached
itself
from
the
mass
and
launched
itself
in
his
direction
wonder
what
eating
him
marvelled
senor
johnson
and
who
is
it
the
figure
drew
steadily
nearer
in
half
an
hour
it
had
approached
near
enough
to
be
recognised
why
it
jed
cried
the
senor
and
spurred
his
horse
what
do
you
mean
riding
out
with
that
foot
he
demanded
sternly
when
within
hailing
distance
foot
hell
gasped
parker
whirling
his
horse
alongside
your
wife
run
away
with
brent
palmer
for
fully
ten
seconds
not
the
faintest
indication
proved
that
the
husband
had
heard
except
that
he
lifted
his
and
the
pony
stopped
what
did
you
say
he
asked
finally
your
wife
run
away
with
brent
palmer
repeated
jed
almost
with
impatience
again
the
long
pause
how
do
you
know
asked
senor
johnson
then
know
hell
it
been
going
on
for
a
month
sang
saw
them
drive
off
they
took
the
buckboard
he
heard
planning
it
he
was
too
scairt
to
tell
till
they
gone
i
just
found
it
out
they
been
gone
two
hours
must
be
going
to
make
the
limited
parker
fidgeted
impatient
to
be
off
you
wasting
time
he
snapped
at
the
motionless
figure
suddenly
johnson
face
flamed
he
reached
from
his
saddle
to
clutch
jed
shoulder
nearly
pulling
the
foreman
from
his
pony
you
lie
he
cried
you
lying
to
me
it
ai
so
parker
made
no
effort
to
extricate
himself
from
the
painful
grasp
his
cool
eyes
met
the
blazing
eyes
of
his
chief
i
wisht
i
did
lie
buck
he
said
sadly
i
wisht
it
was
so
but
it
is
johnson
head
snapped
back
to
the
front
with
a
groan
the
pony
snorted
as
the
steel
bit
his
flanks
leaped
forward
and
with
head
outstretched
nostrils
wide
the
wicked
white
of
the
bronco
flickering
in
the
corner
of
his
eye
struck
the
bee
line
for
the
home
ranch
jed
followed
as
fast
as
he
was
able
on
his
arrival
he
found
his
chief
raging
about
the
house
like
a
wild
beast
sang
trembled
from
a
quick
and
stormy
interrogatory
in
the
kitchen
chairs
had
been
upset
and
let
lie
estrella
belongings
had
been
tumbled
over
senor
johnson
there
found
only
too
sure
proof
in
the
various
lacks
of
a
premeditated
and
permanent
flight
still
he
hoped
and
as
long
as
he
hoped
he
doubted
and
the
demons
of
doubt
tore
him
to
a
frenzy
jed
stood
near
the
door
his
arms
folded
his
weight
shifted
to
his
sound
foot
waiting
and
wondering
what
the
next
move
was
to
be
finally
senor
johnson
struck
with
a
new
idea
ran
to
his
desk
to
rummage
in
a
but
he
found
no
need
to
do
so
for
lying
on
the
desk
was
what
he
sought
the
check
book
from
which
estrella
was
to
draw
on
goodrich
for
the
money
she
might
need
he
fairly
snatched
it
open
two
of
the
checks
had
been
torn
out
stub
and
all
and
then
his
eye
caught
a
crumpled
bit
of
blue
paper
under
the
edge
of
the
desk
he
smoothed
it
out
the
check
was
made
out
to
bearer
and
signed
estrella
johnson
it
called
for
fifteen
thousand
dollars
across
the
middle
was
a
great
ink
blot
reason
for
its
rejection
at
once
senor
johnson
became
singularly
and
dangerously
cool
i
reckon
you
right
jed
he
cried
in
his
natural
voice
gone
with
him
she
got
all
her
traps
with
her
and
she
drawn
on
goodrich
for
fifteen
thousand
and
she
never
thought
of
going
just
this
time
of
month
when
the
miners
are
in
with
their
dust
and
goodrich
would
be
sure
to
have
that
much
that
friend
palmer
been
going
on
a
month
you
say
i
could
say
anything
buck
said
parker
anxiously
a
man
never
sure
enough
about
them
things
till
afterwards
i
know
agreed
buck
johnson
give
me
a
light
for
my
cigarette
he
puffed
for
a
moment
then
rose
stretching
his
legs
in
a
moment
he
returned
from
the
other
room
the
old
shiny
colt
strapped
loosely
on
his
hip
jed
looked
him
in
the
face
with
some
anxiety
the
foreman
was
not
deceived
by
the
man
easy
manner
in
fact
he
knew
it
to
be
symptomatic
of
one
of
the
dangerous
phases
of
senor
character
what
up
buck
he
inquired
just
going
out
for
a
pasear
with
the
little
horse
jed
i
suppose
i
better
come
along
not
with
your
lame
foot
jed
the
tone
of
voice
was
conclusive
jed
cleared
his
throat
she
left
this
for
you
said
he
proffering
an
envelope
them
kind
always
writes
sure
agreed
senor
johnson
stuffing
the
letter
carelessly
into
his
side
pocket
he
half
drew
the
colt
from
its
holster
and
slipped
it
back
again
makes
you
feel
plumb
like
a
man
to
have
one
of
these
things
rubbin
against
you
again
he
observed
irrelevantly
then
he
went
out
leaving
the
foreman
leaning
chair
tilted
against
the
wall
chapter
eleven
the
capture
although
he
had
left
the
room
so
suddenly
senor
johnson
did
not
at
once
open
the
gate
of
the
adobe
wall
his
demeanour
was
gay
for
he
was
a
westerner
but
his
heart
was
black
hardly
did
he
see
beyond
the
convexity
of
his
eyeballs
the
pony
warmed
up
by
its
little
run
pawed
the
ground
impatient
to
be
off
it
was
a
fine
animal
one
of
the
mustang
stock
descended
from
the
arabs
brought
over
by
pizarro
sang
watched
fearfully
from
the
slant
of
the
kitchen
window
jed
parker
even
listened
for
the
beat
of
the
horse
hoofs
but
senor
johnson
stood
his
brain
absolutely
numb
and
empty
his
hand
brushed
against
something
which
fell
to
the
ground
he
brought
his
dull
gaze
to
bear
on
it
the
object
proved
to
be
a
black
wrinkled
spheroid
baked
hard
as
iron
in
the
sunshine
of
estrella
toys
a
potato
squeezed
to
dryness
by
the
constricting
power
of
the
rawhide
in
a
row
along
the
fence
were
others
to
senor
johnson
it
seemed
that
thus
his
heart
was
being
squeezed
in
the
fire
of
suffering
but
the
slight
movement
of
the
falling
object
roused
him
he
swung
open
the
gate
the
pony
bowed
his
head
delightedly
he
was
not
tired
but
his
reins
depended
straight
to
the
ground
and
it
was
a
point
of
honour
with
him
to
stand
at
the
saddle
horn
in
its
sling
hung
the
riata
the
rope
without
which
no
cowman
ever
stirs
abroad
but
which
senor
johnson
had
rarely
used
of
late
senor
johnson
threw
the
reins
over
seized
the
pony
mane
in
his
left
hand
held
the
pommel
with
his
right
and
so
swung
easily
aboard
the
pony
jump
helping
him
to
the
saddle
wheel
tracks
led
down
the
trail
he
followed
them
truth
to
tell
senor
johnson
had
very
little
idea
of
what
he
was
going
to
do
his
action
was
entirely
instinctive
the
wheel
tracks
held
to
the
southwest
so
he
held
to
the
southwest
too
the
pony
hit
his
stride
the
miles
slipped
by
after
seven
of
them
the
animal
slowed
to
a
walk
senor
johnson
allowed
him
to
get
his
wind
then
spurred
him
on
again
he
did
not
even
take
the
ordinary
precautions
of
a
pursuer
he
did
not
even
glance
to
the
horizon
in
search
about
he
came
to
the
first
ranch
house
there
he
took
a
bite
to
eat
and
exchanged
his
horse
for
another
a
favourite
of
his
named
button
the
two
men
asked
no
questions
see
johnson
go
through
asked
the
senor
from
the
saddle
yes
about
three
brent
palmer
driving
her
bound
for
willets
to
visit
the
preacher
wife
she
said
ought
to
catch
up
at
the
circle
i
that
where
they
all
spend
the
night
of
course
so
long
senor
johnson
knew
now
the
couple
would
follow
the
straight
road
they
would
fear
no
pursuit
he
himself
was
supposed
not
to
return
for
a
week
and
the
story
of
visiting
the
minister
wife
was
not
only
plausible
it
was
natural
jed
had
upset
calculations
because
jed
was
shrewd
and
had
eyes
in
his
head
buck
johnson
first
mental
numbness
was
wearing
away
he
was
beginning
to
think
the
night
was
very
still
and
very
dark
the
stars
very
bright
in
their
glow
the
man
loping
steadily
on
through
the
darkness
recalled
that
other
night
equally
still
equally
dark
equally
starry
when
he
had
driven
out
from
his
accustomed
life
into
the
unknown
with
a
woman
by
his
side
the
sight
of
whom
asleep
had
made
him
feel
almost
holy
he
uttered
a
short
laugh
the
pony
was
a
good
one
well
equal
to
twice
the
distance
he
would
be
called
upon
to
cover
this
night
senor
johnson
managed
him
well
by
long
experience
and
a
natural
instinct
he
knew
just
how
hard
to
push
his
mount
just
how
to
keep
inside
the
point
where
too
rapid
exhaustion
of
vitality
begins
toward
the
hour
of
sunrise
he
drew
rein
to
look
about
him
the
desert
till
now
wrapped
in
the
thousand
little
noises
that
make
night
silence
drew
breath
in
preparation
for
the
awe
of
the
daily
wonder
it
lay
across
the
world
heavy
as
a
sea
of
lead
and
as
lifeless
deeply
unconscious
like
an
exhausted
sleeper
the
sky
bent
above
the
stars
paling
far
away
the
mountains
seemed
to
wait
and
then
imperceptibly
those
in
the
east
became
blacker
and
sharper
while
those
in
the
west
became
faintly
lucent
and
lost
the
distinctness
of
their
outline
the
change
was
nothing
yet
everything
and
suddenly
a
desert
bird
sprang
into
the
air
and
began
to
sing
senor
johnson
caught
the
wonder
of
it
the
wonder
of
it
seemed
to
him
wasted
useless
cruel
in
its
effect
he
sighed
impatiently
and
drew
his
hand
across
his
eyes
the
desert
became
grey
with
the
first
light
before
the
glory
in
the
illusory
revealment
of
it
senor
johnson
sharp
frontiersman
eyes
made
out
an
object
moving
away
from
him
in
the
middle
distance
in
a
moment
the
object
rose
for
a
second
against
the
sky
line
then
disappeared
he
knew
it
to
be
the
buckboard
and
that
the
vehicle
had
just
plunged
into
the
dry
bed
of
an
arroyo
immediately
life
surged
through
him
like
an
electric
shock
he
unfastened
the
riata
from
its
sling
shook
loose
the
noose
and
moved
forward
in
the
direction
in
which
he
had
last
seen
the
buckboard
at
the
top
of
the
steep
little
bank
he
stopped
behind
the
mesquite
straining
his
eyes
luck
had
been
good
to
him
the
buckboard
had
pulled
up
and
brent
palmer
was
at
the
moment
beginning
a
little
fire
evidently
to
make
the
morning
coffee
senor
johnson
struck
spurs
to
his
horse
and
half
slid
half
fell
clattering
down
the
steep
clay
bank
almost
on
top
of
the
couple
below
estrella
screamed
brent
palmer
jerked
out
an
oath
and
reached
for
his
gun
the
loop
of
the
riata
fell
wide
over
him
immediately
to
be
jerked
tight
binding
his
arms
tight
to
his
side
the
swept
from
his
feet
by
the
pony
rapid
turn
nevertheless
struggled
desperately
to
wrench
himself
loose
button
intelligent
at
all
rope
work
walked
steadily
backward
step
by
step
taking
up
the
slack
keeping
the
rope
tight
as
he
had
done
hundreds
of
times
before
when
a
steer
had
struggled
as
this
man
was
struggling
now
his
master
leaped
from
the
saddle
and
ran
forward
button
continued
to
walk
slowly
back
the
riata

fought
savagely
even
then
he
kicked
he
rolled
over
and
over
he
wrenched
violently
at
his
pinioned
arms
he
twisted
his
powerful
young
body
from
senor

grasp
again
and
again
but
it
was
no
use
in
less
than
a
minute

was

promptly
slackened

in

senor
johnson
quietly
approached
estrella
the
girl
had
during
the
struggle
gone
through
an
aimless
but
frantic
exhibition
of
terror
now
she
shrank
back
her
eyes
staring
wildly
her
hands
behind
her
ready
to
flop
again
over
the
brink
of
hysteria
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
demanded
her
voice
unnatural
she
received
no
reply
the
man
reached
out
and
took
her
by
the
arm
and
then
at
once
as
though
the
personal
contact
of
the
touch
had
broken
through
the
last
crumb
of
numbness
with
which
shock
had
overlaid
buck
johnson
passions
the
insanity
of
his
rage
broke
out
he
twisted
her
violently
on
her
face
knelt
on
her
back
and
with
the
short
piece
of
hard
rope
the
cowboy
always
carries
to
cattle
he
lashed
her
wrists
together
then
he
arose
panting
his
square
black
beard
rising
and
falling
with
the
rise
and
fall
of
his
great
chest
estrella
had
screamed
again
and
again
until
her
face
had
been
fairly
ground
into
the
alkali
there
she
had
choked
and
strangled
and
gasped
and
sobbed
her
mind
nearly
unhinged
with
terror
she
kept
appealing
to
him
in
a
hoarse
voice
but
could
get
no
reply
no
indication
that
he
had
even
heard
this
terrified
her
still
more
brent
palmer
cursed
steadily
and
accurately
but
the
man
did
not
seem
to
hear
him
either
the
tempest
bad
broken
in
buck
johnson
soul
when
he
had
touched
estrella
he
had
for
the
first
time
realised
what
he
had
lost
it
was
not
the
woman
her
he
despised
but
the
dreams
all
at
once
he
knew
what
they
had
been
to
him
he
understood
how
completely
the
very
substance
of
his
life
had
changed
in
response
to
their
slow
the
new
world
had
been
blasted
the
old
no
longer
existed
to
which
to
return
buck
johnson
stared
at
this
catastrophe
until
his
sight
blurred
why
it
was
atrocious
he
had
done
nothing
to
deserve
it
why
had
they
not
left
him
peaceful
in
his
own
life
of
cattle
and
the
trail
he
had
been
happy
his
dull
eyes
fell
on
the
causes
of
the
ruin
and
then
finally
in
the
understanding
of
how
he
had
been
tricked
of
his
life
his
happiness
his
right
to
the
whole
force
of
the
man
anger
flared
brent
palmer
lay
there
cursing
him
artistically
that
man
had
done
it
that
man
was
in
his
power
he
would
get
even
how
estrella
too
lay
huddled
helpless
and
defenseless
at
his
feet
she
had
done
it
he
would
get
even
how
he
had
spoken
no
word
he
spoke
none
now
either
in
answer
to
estrella
appeals
becoming
piteous
in
their
craving
for
relief
from
suspense
or
in
response
to
brent
palmer
steady
stream
of
insults
and
vituperations
such
things
were
far
below
the
bitterness
and
anger
and
desolation
were
squeezing
his
heart
he
remembered
the
silly
little
row
of
potatoes
sewn
in
the
green
hide
lying
along
the
top
of
the
adobe
fence
some
fresh
and
round
some
dripping
as
the
rawhide
contracted
some
black
and
withered
and
very
small
a
fierce
and
savage
light
sprang
into
his
eyes
chapter
thirteen
the
rawhide
first
of
all
he
unhitched
the
horses
from
the
buckboard
and
turned
them
loose
then
since
he
was
early
trained
in
indian
warfare
he
dragged
palmer
to
the
wagon
wheel
and
tied
him
so
closely
to
it
that
he
could
not
roll
over
for
though
the
was
already
so
fettered
that
his
only
possible
movement
was
of
the
variety
nevertheless
he
might
be
able
to
hitch
himself
along
the
ground
to
a
sharp
stone
there
to
saw
through
the
rope
about
his
wrists
estrella
her
husband
held
in
contempt
he
merely
supplemented
her
wrist
bands
by
one
about
the
ankles
leisurely
he
mounted
button
and
turned
up
the
wagon
trail
leaving
the
two
estrella
had
exhausted
herself
she
was
capable
of
nothing
more
in
the
way
of
emotion
her
eyes
tight
closed
she
inhaled
in
deep
trembling
breaths
and
exhaled
with
the
name
of
her
maker
brent
palmer
on
the
contrary
was
by
no
means
subdued
he
had
expected
to
be
shot
in
cold
blood
now
he
did
not
know
what
to
anticipate
his
black
level
brows
drawn
straight
in
defiance
he
threw
his
curses
after
johnson
retreating
figure
the
latter
however
paid
no
attention
he
had
his
purposes
once
at
the
top
of
the
arroyo
he
took
a
careful
survey
of
the
landscape
now
rich
with
dawn
each
excrescence
on
the
plain
his
eyes
noticed
and
with
instant
skill
relegated
to
its
proper
category
of
mesquite
cactus
at
length
he
swung
button
in
an
easy
lope
toward
what
looked
to
be
a
bunch
of
in
the
middle
distance
but
in
a
moment
the
cattle
could
be
seen
plainly
button
pricked
up
his
ears
he
knew
cattle
now
he
proceeded
tentatively
lifting
high
his
little
hoofs
to
avoid
the
inequalities
of
the
ground
and
the
ground
growths
wondering
whether
he
were
to
be
called
on
to
rope
or
to
drive
when
the
rider
had
approached
to
within
a
hundred
feet
the
cattle
started
immediately
button
understood
that
he
was
to
pursue
no
rope
swung
above
his
head
so
he
sheered
off
and
ran
as
fast
as
he
could
to
cut
ahead
of
the
bunch
but
his
rider
with
knee
and
rein
forced
him
in
after
a
moment
to
his
astonishment
he
found
himself
running
alongside
a
big
steer
button
had
never
hunted
buffalo
buck
johnson
had
the
colt
barked
once
and
then
again
the
steer
staggered
fell
to
his
knees
recovered
and
finally
stopped
the
blood
streaming
from
his
nostrils
in
a
moment
he
fell
heavily
on
his
side
dead
senor
johnson
at
once
dismounted
and
began
methodically
to
skin
the
animal
this
was
not
easy
for
he
had
no
way
of
suspending
the
carcass
nor
of
rolling
it
from
side
to
side
however
he
was
practised
at
it
and
did
a
neat
job
two
or
three
times
he
even
caught
himself
taking
extra
pains
that
the
thin
flesh
strips
should
not
adhere
to
the
inside
of
the
pelt
then
he
smiled
grimly
and
ripped
it
loose
after
the
hide
had
been
removed
he
cut
from
the
edge
around
and
around
a
long
narrow
strip
with
this
he
bound
the
whole
into
a
compact
bundle
strapped
it
on
behind
his
saddle
and
remounted
he
returned
to
the
arroyo
estrella
still
lay
with
her
eyes
closed
brent
palmer
looked
up
keenly
the
saw
the
green
hide
a
puzzled
expression
crept
across
his
face
roughly
johnson
loosed
his
enemy
from
the
wheel
and
dragged
him
to
the
woman
he
passed
the
free
end
of
the
riata
about
them
both
tying
them
close
together
the
girl
continued
to
moan
out
of
her
wits
with
terror
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
you
devil
demanded
palmer
but
received
no
reply
buck
johnson
spread
out
the
rawhide
putting
forth
his
huge
strength
he
carried
to
it
the
pair
bound
together
like
a
bale
of
goods
and
laid
them
on
its
cool
surface
he
threw
across
them
the
edges
and
then
deliberately
began
to
wind
around
and
around
the
huge
and
unwieldy
rawhide
package
the
strip
he
had
cut
from
the
edge
of
the
pelt
nor
was
this
altogether
easy
at
last
brent
palmer
understood
he
writhed
in
the
struggle
of
desperation
foaming
blasphemies
the
uncouth
bundle
rolled
here
and
there
but
inexorably
the
other
from
the
advantage
of
his
position
drew
the
thongs
tighter
and
then
all
at
once
from
vituperation
the
fell
to
pleading
not
for
life
but
for
death
for
god
sake
shoot
me
he
cried
from
within
the
smothering
folds
of
the
rawhide
if
you
ever
had
a
heart
in
you
shoot
me
leave
me
here
to
be
crushed
in
this
vise
you
would
do
that
to
a
yellow
dog
an
injin
would
do
that
buck
it
a
joke
is
it
do
go
away
and
leave
me
buck
i
done
you
dirt
cut
my
heart
out
if
you
want
to
i
wo
say
a
word
but
do
leave
me
here
for
the
sun
his
voice
was
drowned
in
a
piercing
scream
as
estrella
came
to
herself
and
understood
always
the
rawhide
had
possessed
for
her
an
occult
fascination
and
repulsion
she
had
never
been
able
to
touch
it
without
a
shudder
and
yet
she
had
always
been
drawn
to
experiment
with
it
the
terror
of
her
doom
had
now
added
to
it
for
her
all
the
vague
and
premonitory
terrors
which
heretofore
she
had
not
understood
the
richness
of
the
dawn
had
flowed
to
the
west

at

begun

in

and
laid
its
warmth
on

senor

roused
himself
from
his
gloom
to
speak
his
first
words
of
the
episode
there
damn
you
said
he
i
guess
you
be
close
enough
together

turned
away
to
look
for

of

johnson
private
animals
he
was
never
known
to
leave
his
master
in
the
lurch
and
so
was
habitually
allowed
certain
privileges
now
instead
of
remaining
exactly
on
the
spot
where
he
was
tied
to
the
ground
he
had
wandered
out
of
the
dry
arroyo
bed
to
the
upper
level
of
the
plains
where
he
knew
certain
bunch
grasses
might
be
found

climbed
the
steep
wooded
bank
in
search
of
him
the
pony
stood
not
ten
feet
distant
at
his
master
abrupt
appearance
he
merely
raised
his
head
a
wisp
of
grass
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
without
attempting
to
move
away
buck

walked
confidently
to
him
fumbling
in
his
side
pocket
for
the
piece
of
sugar
with
which
he
habitually
soothed

sophisticated
palate
his
hand
encountered

drew
it
out
and
opened
it
dear
buck
it
read
i
am
going
away
i
tried
to
be
good
but
i
ca
it
too
lonesome
for

i
afraid
of
the
horses
and
the
cattle
and
the
men
and
the
desert
i
hate
it
all
i
tried
to
make
you
see
how
i
felt
about
it
but
you
could
seem
to
see
i
know
never
forgive
me
but
i
go
crazy
here
i
almost
crazy
now
i
suppose
you
think
i
a
bad
woman
but
i
am
not
you
wo
believe
that
its
true
though
the
desert
would
make
anyone
bad
i
see
how
you
stand
it
you
been
good
to
me
and
i
really
tried
but
it
no

i
sorry
you
are
going
to
think
me
a
bad
woman
for
i
like
you
and
admire
you
but
nothing
nothing
could
make
me
stay
here
any
longer
she
signed
herself
simply
estrella
sands
her
maiden
name
buck
johnson
stood
staring
at
the
paper
for
a
much
longer
time
than
was
necessary
merely
to
absorb
the
meaning
of
the
words
his
senses
sharpened
by
the
stress
of
the
last
sixteen
hours
were
trying
mightily
to
cut
to
the
mystery
of
a
change
going
on
within
himself
the
phrases
of
the
letter
were
bald
enough
yet
they
conveyed
something
vital
to
his
inner
being
he
could
not
understand
what
it
was
then
abruptly
he
raised
his
eyes
before
him
lay
the
desert
but
a
desert
suddenly
and
miraculously
changed
a
desert
he
had
never
seen
before
mile
after
mile
it
swept
away
before
him
hot
dry
suffocating
lifeless
the
sparse
vegetation
was
grey
with
the
alkali
dust
the
heat
hung
choking
in
the
air
like
a
curtain
lizards
sprawled
in
the
sun
repulsive
a
rattlesnake
dragged
its
loathsome
length
from
under
a
mesquite
the
dried
carcass
of
a
steer
whose
parchment
skin
drew
tight
across
its
bones
rattled
in
the
breeze
here
and
there
rock
ridges
showed
with
the
obscenity
of
so
many
skeletons
exposing
to
the
hard
cruel
sky
the
earth
nakedness
thirst
delirium
death
hovered
palpable
in
the
wind
dreadful
unconquerable
ghastly
the
desert
showed
her
teeth
and
lay
in
wait
like
a
fierce
beast
the
little
soul
of
man
shrank
in
terror
before
it
buck
johnson
stared
recalling
the
phrases
of
the
letter
recalling
the
words
of
his
foreman
jed
parker
it
too
lonesome
for
me
afraid
i
hate
it
all
i
go
crazy
here
the
desert
would
make
anyone
bad
the
country
is
awful
and
the
musing
voice
of
the
old
cattleman
i
wonder
if
she
like
the
country
they
reiterated
themselves
over
and
over
and
always
as
refrain
his
own
confident
reply
like
the
country
sure
why
should
she
and
then
he
recalled
the
summer
just
passing
and
the
woman
who
had
made
no
fuss
chance
remarks
of
hers
came
back
to
him
remarks
whose
meaning
he
had
not
at
the
time
grasped
but
which
now
he
saw
were
desperate
appeals
to
his
understanding
he
had
known
his
desert
he
had
never
known
hers
with
an
exclamation
buck
johnson
turned
abruptly
back
to
the
arroyo
button
followed
him
mildly
curious
certain
that
his
reappearance
meant
a
summons
for
himself
down
the
miniature
cliff
the
man
slid
confidently
without
hesitation
sure
of
himself
his
shoulders
held
squarely
his
step
elastic
his
eye
bright
he
walked
to
the
fearful
shapeless
bundle
now
lying
motionless
on
the
flat
surface
of
the
alkali
brent
palmer
had
fallen
into
a
grim
silence
but
estrella
still
moaned
the
cattleman
drew
his
knife
and
ripped
loose
the
bonds
immediately
the
flaps
of
the
wet
rawhide
fell
apart
exposing
to
the
new
daylight
the
two
bound
together
buck
johnson
leaned
over
to
touch
the
shoulder
estrella
said
he
gently
her
eyes
came
open
with
a
snap
and
stared
into
his
wild
with
the
surprise
of
his
return
estrella
he
repeated
how
old
are
you
she
gulped
down
a
sob
unable
to
comprehend
the
purport
of
his
question
how
old
are
you
estrella
he
repeated
again
she
gasped
finally
ah
said
he
he
stood
for
a
moment
in
deep
thought
then
began
methodically
without
haste
to
cut
loose
the
thongs
that
bound
the
two
together
when
the
man
and
the
woman
were
quite
freed
he
stood
for
a
moment
the
knife
in
his
hand
looking
down
on
them
then
he
swung
himself
into
the
saddle
and
rode
away
straight
down
the
narrow
arroyo
out
beyond
its
lower
widening
into
the
vast
plains
the
hither
side
of
the
chiricahuas
the
alkali
dust
was
snatched
by
the
wind
from
beneath
his
horse
feet
smaller
and
smaller
he
dwindled
rising
and
falling
rising
and
falling
in
the
monotonous
lope
the
heat
shimmer
veiled
him
for
a
moment
but
he
reappeared
a
mirage
concealed
him
but
he
emerged
on
the
other
side
of
it
then
suddenly
he
was
gone
the
desert
had
swallowed
him
up
