one
emergency
nancy
stood
on
the
steps
of
the
train
and
waved
at
a
couple
a
man
and
woman
of
middle
years
strange
how
she
could
be
so
close
to
tears
yet
so
buoyantly
happy
all
in
the
same
moment
the
train
began
to
move
slowly
and
nancy
called
back
be
sure
to
forward
all
tommy
s
letters
mom
her
mother
nodded
and
smiled
while
her
father
lifted
his
hat
in
that
courtly
way
he
had
nancy
could
scarcely
believe
that
at
last
she
was
on
her
way
to
becoming
a
member
of
the
great
army
nurse
corps
in
fact
she
was
one
now
for
she
had
already
taken
her
oath
of
allegiance
this
slowly
moving
train
marked
the
beginning
of
a
wonderful
journey
that
might
take
her
anywhere
in
the
whole
italy
india
the
arctic
or
the
south
pacific
she
had
been
praying
ever
since
she
joined
that
it
would
be
the
south
pacific
not
only
because
her
brother
was
there
flying
a
bomber
over
the
tropical
blue
waters
but
because
the
tropics
had
always
seemed
fascinating
but
little
did
she
dream
what
she
must
go
through
before
she
saw
again
that
beloved
couple
she
had
just
left
as
she
turned
back
into
the
pullman
she
suddenly
felt
empty
with
that
awful
hollow
feeling
she
thought
how
lucky
she
had
been
to
get
her
nurse
s
training
right
in
her
own
home
town
she
had
never
known
the
feeling
of
homesickness
for
her
few
brief
trips
had
all
been
for
pleasure
but
this
was
different
and
far
more
exciting
yet
she
knew
suddenly
now
that
it
would
also
have
its
heartaches
from
her
seat
in
the
car
she
caught
one
more
glimpse
of
her
parents
how
lonesome
they
would
be
with
both
their
children
in
the
service
for
a
few
minutes
as
the
train
crawled
out
of
the
city
nancy
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
two
she
was
leaving
behind
how
concerned
poor
mom
had
been
when
she
said
do
be
careful
darling
about
getting
wet
you
know
how
easily
you
take
cold
when
your
feet
are
nancy
had
promised
to
be
as
careful
as
possible
but
didn
t
fret
her
mother
by
saying
she
was
afraid
there
would
often
be
days
on
end
when
her
feet
would
always
be
wet
if
her
experiences
were
anything
like
the
overseas
nurses
she
heard
from
in
italy
and
new
guinea
not
until
the
last
house
of
her
beloved
town
had
vanished
beyond
the
green
hills
did
nancy
turn
her
gaze
to
the
inside
of
the
pullman
she
noticed
now
that
practically
everyone
was
in
uniform
both
men
and
women
there
were
two
wacs
across
from
her
and
an
anc
captain
a
little
farther
up
she
thought
it
would
have
been
more
fun
had
someone
been
going
with
her
this
trip
to
the
capital
was
always
so
slow
and
boring
then
there
would
be
a
tiresome
wait
before
she
took
the
sleeper
for
alabama
she
tried
to
read
but
was
too
keyed
up
to
concentrate
she
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
great
adventure
into
which
she
was
going
settling
her
head
against
the
cushion
she
faced
the
window
watching
the
rolling
hills
suddenly
she
realized
she
was
tired
after
all
the
excitement
of
farewell
parties
and
packing
how
grand
everyone
had
been
to
her
since
she
was
the
only
volunteer
in
her
class
she
had
been
given
a
dance
at
the
nurse
s
home
how
could
anyone
stay
behind
she
wondered
when
the
fighting
men
needed
so
many
nurses
drowsiness
was
creeping
over
her
when
she
caught
the
low
tones
of
two
men
behind
her
the
fact
that
they
were
speaking
in
a
foreign
tongue
pricked
her
to
alertness
she
leaned
closer
to
the
window
and
concentrated
they
were
talking
almost
in
whispers
but
she
heard
the
gutteral
syllables
of
several
german
words
she
had
studied
a
little
german
in
her
high
school
days
in
order
to
sing
some
selections
from
the
wagnerian
operas
now
she
caught
the
words
and
tonight
eight
cars
she
translated
the
pullman
conductor
came
down
the
aisle
and
the
men
fell
silent
if
they
hadn
t
become
so
abruptly
silent
at
his
approach
nancy
might
have
thought
little
of
the
whispered
conversation
though
she
tried
to
dismiss
her
suspicions
attributing
her
sensitiveness
to
the
fact
that
she
had
just
entered
the
service
she
could
not
forget
the
two
men
speaking
german
fluently
who
sat
behind
her
after
an
interval
nancy
decided
to
take
a
look
at
the
pair
she
started
down
the
aisle
under
pretense
of
getting
a
drink
of
water
the
man
nearest
the
aisle
had
the
broad
face
and
blond
complexion
of
a
typical
german
though
he
wore
the
uniform
of
an
american
soldier
the
other
was
in
civilian
clothes
and
wore
a
small
mustache
all
nancy
could
glean
in
her
hasty
inspection
was
that
he
had
a
lean
countenance
dark
coloring
and
wore
glasses
on
her
return
she
noticed
that
the
blond
had
a
corporal
s
stripes
on
his
sleeve
if
he
was
a
spy
surely
the
army
would
have
detected
it
before
making
him
a
corporal
she
thought
and
promptly
tried
to
dismiss
her
suspicions
not
until
eleven
o
clock
that
night
when
she
was
hurrying
with
the
crowd
to
go
aboard
the
train
did
she
again
think
of
those
words
spoken
in
german
behind
her
her
pullman
was
at
the
end
of
a
very
long
train
soldiers
were
filing
into
the
front
coaches
she
counted
eight
cars
ahead
of
hers
suddenly
she
recalled
the
words
she
had
heard
behind
her
at
the
beginning
of
her
journey
and
here
they
were
eight
coaches
of
service
men
again
she
thought
of
their
words
tonight
could
there
possibly
be
any
connection
between
those
words
and
this
troop
train
nancy
followed
the
redcap
to
her
pullman
seat
with
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
she
knew
that
spies
all
over
the
country
were
busy
trying
to
get
information
about
the
movements
of
troop
trains
and
transports
she
pressed
her
eyes
to
the
window
and
looked
out
at
the
milling
crowd
then
suddenly
she
saw
the
blond
corporal
he
did
not
get
aboard
the
train
but
watched
the
troops
marching
down
the
paved
walk
between
the
tracks
then
he
turned
sharply
and
hurried
back
toward
the
station
the
man
in
civilian
clothes
was
not
with
him
nancy
tried
to
shake
off
the
nagging
uneasiness
that
haunted
her
even
after
she
was
comfortably
stretched
in
her
berth
and
the
train
was
rushing
out
across
the
red
georgia
hills
but
her
interest
in
what
lay
ahead
was
too
keen
for
her
to
remain
depressed
several
times
she
raised
the
shade
to
peep
out
when
the
train
slowed
at
small
towns
where
street
lights
twinkled
sleepily
but
at
last
the
hum
of
the
wheels
lulled
her
to
sleep
then
suddenly
several
hours
before
dawn
there
came
a
terrific
crash
and
jolt
nancy
caught
wildly
at
the
clothes
hammock
to
keep
from
being
hurled
into
the
aisle
as
the
pullman
crashed
to
a
stop
and
toppled
slightly
to
the
right
screams
and
moans
were
heard
above
the
grinding
noises
nancy
clung
to
the
hammock
a
moment
too
stunned
to
move
she
expected
the
tilting
coach
to
crash
to
earth
any
moment
lights
had
vanished
beyond
the
cracks
of
her
curtain
with
shaking
hands
she
found
her
flashlight
in
the
zipper
bag
left
at
the
foot
of
her
berth
she
opened
the
curtain
and
turned
the
light
up
and
down
the
aisle
several
who
hadn
t
been
thrown
from
their
berths
were
climbing
out
wanting
to
know
what
had
happened
groans
curses
and
cries
only
added
to
the
confusion
then
with
the
speed
of
a
fireman
preparing
to
answer
a
call
to
duty
nancy
put
on
her
clothes
some
sure
instinct
warned
her
that
in
a
few
minutes
there
would
be
no
time
to
think
of
herself
at
last
her
long
legs
swung
down
from
the
berth
her
flashlight
showed
some
people
still
lying
where
they
had
fallen
in
the
aisle
some
actually
climbed
over
them
in
their
frantic
haste
to
get
out
of
the
leaning
pullman
she
turned
her
light
on
the
nearest
injured
person
it
was
a
lady
moaning
that
her
arm
was
broken
a
big
man
clad
only
in
his
undershirt
and
army
trousers
emerged
from
his
berth
here
give
me
a
hand
ordered
nancy
this
lady
has
a
broken
the
soldier
who
was
of
powerful
build
braced
himself
against
the
berth
on
the
lower
side
and
lifted
the
stunned
old
lady
to
his
shoulder
nancy
held
her
flashlight
so
he
could
see
as
they
made
their
way
toward
the
exit
she
snatched
a
sheet
to
use
for
bandages
from
one
of
the
berths
as
she
went
on
reaching
the
platform
they
found
the
pullman
was
leaning
precariously
against
a
clay
cut
on
one
side
while
the
steps
on
the
other
were
high
in
air
flares
had
already
been
lighted
beside
the
track
and
eager
hands
reached
up
to
help
with
the
injured
woman
nancy
never
remembered
how
she
got
down
herself
her
one
idea
was
to
help
the
little
old
lady
whose
wavy
gray
hair
was
so
like
her
own
mother
s
do
you
have
a
pocket
knife
she
asked
the
service
man
as
he
was
stretching
the
woman
on
the
ground
he
dug
in
his
trouser
pocket
and
produced
one
cut
me
a
splint
off
some
bush
or
tree
she
ordered
i
ll
have
to
protect
this
broken
arm
till
it
can
be
and
properly
she
took
off
her
coat
to
cushion
the
gray
head
while
she
waited
for
the
splint
she
saw
that
injured
people
were
being
brought
from
the
three
rear
coaches
just
beyond
the
clay
bank
which
had
saved
their
car
from
greater
damage
she
saw
that
several
coaches
had
overturned
and
telescoped
into
a
horrible
mass
of
wreckage
the
soldier
came
back
promptly
with
a
good
splint
from
which
he
was
deftly
peeling
the
bark
to
nancy
s
surprise
he
knelt
on
the
ground
and
in
the
light
of
her
flash
began
to
manipulate
the
broken
bone
into
position
one
glance
at
those
skillful
fingers
and
nancy
exclaimed
oh
you
re
a
doctor
yes
was
all
he
said
as
he
proceeded
to
the
business
of
the
moment
thank
god
she
said
earnestly
and
began
to
tear
the
sheet
into
bandages
as
she
had
done
numberless
times
before
in
the
emergency
room
nancy
helped
bind
up
the
broken
arm
i
see
you
ve
at
least
had
first
aid
he
said
as
they
worked
i
m
a
nurse
she
retorted
as
tersely
as
he
had
informed
her
he
was
a
doctor
there
ll
be
plenty
for
us
to
do
tonight
he
told
her
when
the
arm
was
set
he
lifted
the
frail
woman
and
carried
her
out
of
the
cut
wait
here
with
her
the
doctor
ordered
i
ll
go
back
for
my
bag
she
should
have
a
hypo
you
can
someone
had
placed
some
boxes
for
steps
at
the
rear
entrance
to
the
coach
and
he
returned
that
way
they
were
still
hauling
people
out
and
stretching
them
beside
the
end
coach
which
by
some
miracle
had
not
overturned
to
nancy
s
surprise
she
recognized
the
anc
captain
she
had
noticed
on
the
train
yesterday
afternoon
she
was
trying
to
stop
the
bleeding
in
a
leg
wound
of
a
man
next
to
nancy
s
old
lady
please
someone
try
to
find
a
doctor
she
said
to
no
one
in
particular
one
was
here
just
now
nancy
told
her
he
ll
be
back
in
a
moment
he
went
for
his
nancy
bent
to
help
the
captain
make
a
tourniquet
below
the
injured
man
s
knee
she
had
just
secured
the
knot
with
a
stick
when
she
saw
the
doctor
returning
the
anc
captain
straightened
and
saluted
this
man
will
have
to
have
some
stitches
major
she
said
i
ll
look
after
to
nancy
s
consternation
she
saw
that
the
soldier
she
had
just
been
ordering
around
had
put
on
his
coat
his
gold
leaf
indicated
him
a
major
and
the
caduceus
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
medical
corps
she
felt
terribly
embarrassed
at
her
mistake
he
seemed
to
think
nothing
of
it
however
for
he
explained
to
the
captain
i
ll
keep
this
young
lady
to
help
me
she
says
she
s
a
then
i
ll
go
look
after
some
of
the
others
said
the
captain
alertly
major
reed
was
stooping
to
give
attention
to
the
injured
man
and
asked
as
he
did
so
where
did
you
graduate
stanford
hospital
i
m
nancy
dale
i
just
joined
the
army
nurse
corps
and
am
on
my
way
for
basic
this
explanation
seemed
quite
satisfactory
to
the
major
he
set
his
bag
on
the
ground
and
pulled
the
zipper
give
the
lady
there
a
hypo
we
ll
need
one
here
too
tell
captain
lewis
to
get
what
she
needs
from
my
until
the
sun
rose
over
the
red
clay
hills
nancy
worked
beside
major
reed
setting
bones
sewing
up
cuts
and
giving
sedatives
to
the
hysterical
several
automobiles
had
gathered
and
focused
their
headlights
upon
the
scene
though
nancy
had
never
faced
such
an
emergency
she
did
not
lose
her
head
nor
did
her
hands
shake
as
she
worked
to
relieve
the
injured
only
once
did
she
feel
an
inward
tremor
and
that
was
when
she
thought
of
how
she
had
ordered
major
reed
around
but
there
was
no
time
to
dwell
on
that
in
the
busy
hours
before
the
arrival
of
nurses
doctors
and
ambulances
from
the
nearest
town
someone
to
relieve
us
at
last
said
captain
mary
lewis
who
now
looked
as
weary
as
nancy
felt
i
phoned
the
camp
for
a
car
to
be
sent
for
us
major
reed
told
them
there
ll
be
plenty
of
room
for
the
three
of
us
and
our
nancy
glanced
from
one
officer
to
the
other
in
astonishment
oh
are
we
really
within
driving
distance
of
the
camp
only
about
fifty
miles
replied
major
reed
and
you
re
both
going
there
captain
lewis
nodded
and
smiled
i
ve
been
on
a
tour
of
inspection
and
major
reed
has
been
assigned
work
illustration
i
m
nancy
dale
nancy
told
the
then
i

almost
as
soon
as
scheduled
said
nancy
in
relief
i
was
worrying
over
being
off
young
lady
if
you
ever
had
a
good
excuse
for
being
late
you
have
it
this
time
said
the
major
he
looked
down
at
her
a
moment
and
smiled
whimsically
i
d
say
she
s
made
of
good
fighting
stuff
wouldn
t
you
miss
lewis
i
ll
say
agreed
miss
lewis
she
s
had
a
fine
nancy
s
face
flushed
then
she
burst
forth
impulsively
oh
i
hope
they
ll
think
me
good
enough
to
send
to
the
south
that
s
something
we
have
to
leave
to
our
uncle
samuel
young
nancy
was
silent
a
moment
then
looked
up
at
the
major
shyly
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
i
owe
you
an
apology
how
s
that
for
ordering
you
that
you
cut
me
a
splint
but
how
could
i
know
you
were
a
major
he
broke
into
a
hearty
laugh
well
miss
dale
i
can
t
see
that
an
officer
is
due
any
respect
when
he
goes
around
in
his
undershirt
you
did
what
any
nurse
should
have
that
must
be
your
car
over
there
major
said
miss
lewis
so
tis
let
s
get
our
baggage
and
be
chapter
two
hurdles
at
major
reed
s
request
a
young
private
brought
nancy
s
baggage
from
the
pullman
and
packed
it
in
the
car
the
major
gave
the
local
doctor
last
minute
instructions
about
some
of
the
injured
while
nancy
and
captain
mary
lewis
waited
for
him
it
was
the
first
five
minutes
nancy
had
had
since
the
accident
to
think
quietly
about
the
catastrophe
with
a
sudden
inner
jolt
she
recalled
the
two
passengers
who
had
sat
behind
her
the
previous
afternoon
could
there
possibly
be
any
connection
between
their
whispered
conversation
and
this
tragedy
the
demand
for
her
services
during
these
last
horrible
hours
had
driven
out
all
other
thoughts
except
the
use
of
her
skill
in
helping
the
injured
when
the
doctor
returned
to
the
car
and
started
to
get
in
nancy
said
major
reed
there
s
something
i
believe
i
should
tell
you
before
we
leave
he
glanced
at
her
his
foot
lifted
to
the
step
and
said
yes
this
may
or
may
not
have
any
connection
with
the
they
ve
already
found
evidence
that
it
s
the
work
of
saboteurs
he
told
her
frankly
nancy
felt
the
blood
drain
from
her
cheeks
what
would
they
think
of
her
not
mentioning
her
suspicions
sooner
she
had
gone
too
far
now
to
remain
silent
briefly
she
gave
an
account
of
the
german
conversation
behind
her
the
previous
afternoon
i
might
have
thought
little
of
it
she
hastened
to
add
on
seeing
the
scowl
on
the
major
s
face
but
on
boarding
the
train
last
night
i
noticed
there
were
eight
troop
cars
instantly
i
thought
of
what
the
two
men
behind
me
had
said
i
also
noticed
the
blond
corporal
watching
the
entraining
men
he
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
crowd
outside
my
you
should
have
reported
him
as
a
suspect
stated
captain
mary
lewis
sharply
nancy
flushed
and
asked
to
whom
should
i
have
reported
him
they
would
only
have
laughed
at
me
nobody
on
that
train
knew
who
i
never
take
a
chance
when
it
comes
to
anything
like
that
said
major
reed
where
large
numbers
of
lives
are
involved
it
s
excusable
to
be
suspicious
of
your
own
brother
rather
than
take
any
nancy
didn
t
flare
up
in
anger
or
burst
into
tears
but
looked
the
major
squarely
in
the
eyes
i
m
sure
you
re
right
had
i
been
at
a
hospital
or
in
camp
i
would
have
reported
my
suspicions
to
the
right
authorities
under
the
circumstances
sir
what
would
you
have
done
the
major
got
suddenly
into
the
car
and
slammed
the
door
i
would
probably
have
done
exactly
as
you
did
young
then
nancy
did
want
to
cry
from
sheer
relief
their
car
crawled
off
through
the
traffic
congestion
at
the
scene
of
the
accident
the
highway
ran
parallel
with
the
track
for
some
distance
they
had
an
appalling
view
of
the
twisted
mass
of
wreckage
in
the
forward
part
of
the
train
at
a
group
of
cars
major
reed
had
the
driver
stop
he
got
out
to
talk
to
two
men
a
few
minutes
later
he
brought
them
over
to
the
car
and
had
nancy
give
a
description
of
the
two
suspects
she
had
noticed
on
the
train
you
are
to
be
commended
miss
dale
said
nelson
the
taller
of
the
two
strangers
for
at
least
giving
the
suspects
a
looking
i
had
to
see
what
they
were
like
after
i
heard
them
whispering
in
german
exclaimed
nancy
but
when
i
saw
one
was
a
corporal
in
the
army
i
thought
perhaps
i
was
being
too
nelson
laughed
bitterly
we
ve
picked
up
several
spies
lately
disguised
in
soldier
s
uniforms
a
man
isn
t
always
to
be
trusted
just
because
he
wears
our
i
suppose
it
would
be
impossible
now
to
locate
the
pair
said
nancy
unhappily
the
blond
could
be
anywhere
among
the
thousands
back
there
at
the
station
or
hundreds
of
miles
away
by
this
the
other
plainclothes
official
said
you
underrate
our
secret
service
miss
the
description
you
ve
given
is
elaborate
compared
with
some
we
get
we
ve
sometimes
caught
em
on
little
more
than
a
he
saluted
respectfully
and
their
car
rolled
out
to
the
open
country
and
across
the
red
clay
hills
they
were
all
too
tired
for
conversation
even
if
they
had
had
the
heart
for
it
after
such
a
depressing
experience
captain
lewis
did
not
seem
inclined
to
conversation
and
nancy
was
glad
enough
to
ride
in
silence
she
snuggled
deep
into
her
corner
and
was
actually
asleep
before
they
had
left
the
wreck
five
miles
behind
some
time
later
she
was
startled
by
a
gentle
hand
shaking
her
shoulder
here
we
are
my
dear
miss
lewis
was
saying
nancy
opened
her
eyes
she
sat
up
with
a
start
wondering
if
there
d
been
another
wreck
to
her
amazement
she
found
they
had
stopped
in
front
of
a
long
building
some
nurses
were
coming
down
the
steps
across
the
lawn
she
saw
another
group
in
coveralls
you
mean
we
are
actually
camp
she
asked
in
amazement
you
slept
like
a
baby
all
the
way
said
captain
lewis
that
ability
to
relax
at
once
will
stand
you
in
good
stead
when
you
get
in
the
thick
of
nancy
was
pleased
mother
has
always
said
if
anyone
would
give
me
a
pillow
i
could
go
to
sleep
any
time
and
this
time
you
didn
t
even
have
a
then
suddenly
captain
lewis
assumed
her
official
air
lieutenant
hauser
will
show
you
to
your
room
and
help
you
get
settled
would
you
like
to
join
me
at
breakfast
when
you
get
cleaned
up
oh
yes
thanks
this
brisk
morning
air
has
really
whipped
up
my
not
until
long
afterward
did
nancy
discover
what
an
honor
captain
lewis
had
bestowed
upon
her
too
many
new
and
exciting
things
were
happening
just
then
for
her
to
appreciate
the
full
significance
of
the
invitation
captain
lewis
introduced
her
to
lieutenant
hauser
who
was
rather
short
and
stocky
and
had
a
ready
smile
she
gave
nancy
the
comfortable
feeling
that
there
was
really
no
difference
in
their
positions
even
though
miss
hauser
was
already
a
first
lieutenant
your
roommate
is
mabel
larsen
explained
miss
hauser
she
got
in
yesterday
and
already
knows
enough
to
show
you
the
they
went
down
a
long
narrow
hall
a
moment
later
miss
hauser
opened
the
door
of
a
neat
little
room
with
two
beds
attractive
cretonne
drapes
and
comfortable
chairs
and
floor
lamps
an
exclamation
of
delight
escaped
nancy
oh
i
thought
we
d
be
sleeping
on
army
cots
in
tents
you
ll
get
plenty
of
that
later
better
enjoy
these
comforts
while
you
have
them
lieutenant
hauser
warned
her
mabel
s
out
on
the
obstacle
course
right
now
you
ll
have
a
chance
to
do
some
unpacking
and
clean
up
before
she
comes
miss
hauser
pointed
out
a
list
of
rules
tacked
on
the
door
told
nancy
where
the
dining
room
was
and
left
her
to
her
own
devices
an
hour
later
when
nancy
came
back
from
a
hearty
breakfast
with
captain
lewis
she
found
mabel
larsen
stretched
on
her
bed
mabel
merely
lifted
her
head
when
nancy
came
in
and
greeted
her
casually
oh
hello
you
re
the
latest
shavetail
i
suppose
i
m
nancy
dale
and
they
tell
me
you
re
mabel
glad
you
came
sorry
i
can
t
be
very
formal
just
now
but
i
m
all
only
fifteen
minutes
to
get
my
wind
she
groaned
softly
gosh
but
my
legs
ache
what
s
wrong
are
you
ill
oh
nothing
that
won
t
be
worse
tomorrow
just
wait
till
you
try
those
hurdles
mabel
turned
over
cautiously
and
groaned
again
i
might
ve
been
pounded
by
japs
from
the
way
these
shanks
nancy
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
you
must
ve
been
neglecting
your
daily
dozen
before
you
came
i
ve
never
been
one
of
those
exercise
addicts
stated
mabel
i
ve
always
gotten
enough
floor
work
in
the
wards
without
this
one
two
three
mabel
reached
for
a
bottle
of
rubbing
alcohol
and
began
to
massage
her
rather
plump
legs
wait
let
me
do
it
said
nancy
mabel
lay
back
on
the
bed
and
gave
herself
up
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
soothing
touch
of
nancy
s
hands
you
oughter
been
a
masseuse
she
sighed
then
after
a
moment
she
asked
why
were
you
so
late
we
thought
you
were
coming
on
that
early
there
was
a
wreck
said
nancy
reluctant
to
recall
her
trying
experience
mabel
sat
up
suddenly
you
mean
the
train
you
were
on
nancy
nodded
and
gave
her
a
hasty
sketch
of
what
had
happened
and
their
work
with
the
injured
well
if
i
m
not
the
daughter
of
a
sloth
burst
forth
mabel
here
i
am
letting
you
give
me
an
alcohol
rub
when
you
ve
already
been
working
like
a
trooper
for
hours
oh
i
got
a
bit
of
sleep
coming
over
in
the
car
but
miss
lewis
suggested
that
i
go
to
bed
again
till
lunch
time
i
had
breakfast
with
her
just
not
captain
mary
lewis
asked
mabel
nancy
nodded
as
she
began
to
take
off
her
clothes
well
aren
t
you
the
lucky
bloke
exclaimed
mabel
hobnobbing
with
the
majors
and
captains
on
the
very
day
of
your
it
just
happened
that
think
of
the
chance
you
had
to
prove
to
em
right
off
the
bat
what
stuff
you
re
made
of
some
people
do
have
all
the
nancy
didn
t
know
just
what
to
make
of
this
talkative
roommate
but
she
was
too
tired
to
care
just
then
she
found
her
rumpled
pajamas
in
the
zipper
bag
and
got
them
out
in
the
meantime
mabel
was
painfully
putting
on
her
uniform
to
report
to
class
they
ll
probably
give
you
a
bunch
of
this
gear
this
afternoon
mabel
said
i
never
had
so
many
new
duds
all
at
one
time
as
they
issued
to
me
miss
hauser
said
i
d
get
my
uniforms
this
afternoon
and
be
given
my
schedule
too
after
that
experience
this
morning
i
m
rather
glad
i
don
t
have
to
get
down
to
business
till
nancy
crawled
into
bed
and
was
thankful
to
find
it
very
comfortable
she
watched
her
new
friend
straighten
her
tie
and
set
her
new
visor
cap
at
a
rakish
angle
on
her
reddish
curls
boy
do
i
feel
swell
in
this
uniform
boasted
mabel
it
sure
boosts
your
morale
to
feel
you
re
really
one
of
the
bunch
at
last
i
ve
been
raring
to
get
in
for
so
have
i
nancy
told
her
but
i
only
graduated
last
shake
sister
you
re
a
gal
after
my
own
heart
i
just
finished
the
irrepressible
mabel
seized
nancy
s
hand
that
lay
on
the
spread
i
believe
we
re
gonner
hit
it
off
we
ll
make
a
team
to
whip
the
japs
nancy
said
entering
into
the
spirit
of
her
banter
say
that
s
swell
so
you
want
to
go
down
under
too
you
bet
my
brother
s
flying
a
bomber
i
ve
got
a
sweety
out
there
too
yeah
we
ll
make
a
long
and
short
the
chestnut
curls
and
the
mop
your
common
sense
and
my
then
they
were
both
laughing
and
the
ice
was
completely
broken
mabel
glanced
at
her
watch
and
bounded
toward
the
door
be
seeing
you
later
she
called
back
nancy
felt
as
though
a
whirlwind
had
just
passed
and
she
settled
into
her
pillow
with
a
sigh
of
relief
she
felt
certain
she
was
going
to
like
her
new
roommate
though
most
of
her
remarks
were
flippant
she
showed
that
there
was
the
right
sort
of
stuff
underneath
after
a
couple
of
hours
sleep
and
a
shower
nancy
felt
ready
to
tackle
her
new
life
she
spent
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
being
fitted
for
her
clothes
she
was
surprised
to
know
the
old
blue
uniforms
were
no
longer
issued
and
that
she
would
wear
olive
drab
for
dress
they
found
the
japs
wearing
blue
sometimes
in
the
pacific
area
it
proved
confusing
lieutenant
hauser
told
her
white
uniforms
are
not
customarily
worn
either
by
nurses
at
the
easily
spotted
from
the
air
all
these
changes
are
the
result
of
practical
when
nancy
went
out
to
supper
with
her
new
friend
mabel
remarked
leisure
s
a
scarce
commodity
round
here
we
put
in
eight
hours
of
hard
work
every
day
counting
all
the
classes
ward
work
drills
and
stuff
six
days
a
week
too
sister
i
m
used
to
that
nancy
told
her
nancy
s
real
initiation
came
the
next
morning
when
they
were
routed
out
before
daylight
for
half
an
hour
of
calisthenics
mabel
stuck
close
to
give
her
a
prod
or
hint
against
doing
things
wrong
that
morning
nancy
also
noticed
tini
hoffman
for
the
first
time
unlike
her
nickname
tini
was
of
a
large
build
and
she
seemed
not
to
have
the
slightest
sense
of
rhythm
or
coordination
she
was
constantly
getting
out
of
step
and
throwing
the
line
off
all
right
then
i
ll
step
out
snapped
tini
when
she
had
been
reprimanded
the
third
time
i
can
t
do
anything
to
please
you
ll
stay
in
ranks
and
keep
trying
till
you
do
it
correctly
lieutenant
carson
stated
or
else
after
that
the
girl
stomped
about
like
a
spoiled
child
making
the
dust
fly
over
those
around
her
nancy
wondered
why
she
was
here
at
all
if
she
had
not
come
in
the
spirit
of
cooperation
with
the
training
program
too
much
silly
falderal
she
heard
tini
say
in
a
low
tone
when
the
formation
broke
up
i
came
in
to
nurse
the
sick
not
to
do
a
lot
of
crazy
that
afternoon
tini
was
close
to
mabel
and
nancy
when
they
were
jumping
some
hurdles
nancy
s
long
legs
swung
easily
over
the
first
two
but
the
last
took
all
the
ability
she
had
tini
however
didn
t
even
try
to
go
over
the
last
but
quickly
ducked
under
when
the
instructor
wasn
t
looking
go
back
you
cheat
snapped
mabel
we
re
not
going
to
have
any
in
this
mabel
s
bluntness
attracted
the
attention
of
lieutenant
john
warren
who
was
putting
them
through
this
phase
of
their
training
he
called
out
now
now
young
lady
you
have
to
take
it
over
the
top
you
tini
knocked
down
the
bar
twice
before
she
finally
made
that
last
hurdle
she
scraped
her
chin
the
first
time
she
hit
the
gravel
when
their
instructor
was
out
of
hearing
she
gave
him
some
back
talk
and
continued
to
grumble
while
she
crawled
parallel
with
nancy
and
mabel
under
some
lengths
of
chicken
wire
nancy
was
sure
her
palms
had
as
much
earth
on
them
as
skin
when
she
finally
came
triumphantly
through
on
the
other
side
boy
what
an
experience
she
burst
forth
when
she
got
up
to
brush
herself
off
just
imagine
how
much
faster
we
could
do
it
if
the
japs
were
using
the
soles
of
our
shoes
for
target
practice
mabel
reminded
her
there
s
just
no
sense
in
all
this
complained
tini
wiping
her
gritty
palms
on
her
coveralls
nancy
didn
t
like
this
girl
nor
her
attitude
and
found
she
couldn
t
keep
silent
any
longer
looks
as
though
you
d
better
get
out
of
this
right
now
she
snapped
if
i
understand
the
reason
for
all
this
it
s
for
our
own
prepare
us
for
real
trials
to
come
if
we
re
sent
into
the
fighting
mind
your
own
business
snapped
tini
like
a
spoiled
child
i
ve
got
a
right
to
blow
off
if
i
want
she
stalked
on
to
the
next
test
here
they
were
required
to
swing
by
a
rope
down
the
side
of
a
ravine
nancy
and
mabel
followed
slowly
and
mabel
said
if
they
keep
her
on
she
ll
get
our
unit
into
trouble
sure
as
i
doubt
if
they
keep
her
with
such
an
she
griped
like
that
all
the
way
through
nurse
s
training
mabel
explained
oh
was
she
in
your
class
yes
we
came
here
together
too
you
have
to
hand
it
to
tini
though
she
has
a
keen
mind
and
makes
grand
marks
they
had
no
grounds
for
turning
her
down
i
she
makes
me
feel
as
uncomfortable
as
those
suspects
on
the
train
yeah
agreed
mabel
there
re
more
ways
of
working
against
uncle
sam
than
outright
chapter
three
suspects
in
the
busy
days
that
followed
nancy
with
the
other
girls
of
her
unit
was
plunged
into
the
intensive
work
of
preparing
for
service
in
the
fighting
zones
fully
alert
to
the
importance
of
these
instructions
nancy
worked
even
harder
than
she
had
during
her
nurse
s
training
here
they
must
put
the
lectures
and
discussions
into
practice
at
once
the
day
after
her
arrival
there
were
lectures
on
military
courtesy
and
customs
of
the
service
they
were
told
how
to
wear
their
uniforms
and
how
to
recognize
the
various
insignia
of
office
in
their
room
afterwards
nancy
and
mabel
had
lots
of
fun
practicing
the
military
salute
you
ve
got
to
learn
to
do
it
automatically
said
mabel
your
fingers
should
go
to
your
forehead
when
you
see
a
superior
officer
as
instinctively
as
your
foot
goes
to
the
car
brake
in
an
and
i
suppose
it
will
prove
to
be
a
restriction
emergency
if
you
don
t
nancy
came
back
with
a
laugh
for
the
next
day
or
two
they
saluted
every
time
they
passed
each
other
in
their
room
and
had
some
good
laughs
over
their
actions
tini
hoffman
says
she
hates
to
salute
mabel
confided
she
says
it
makes
her
feel
if
tini
isn
t
careful
she
s
going
to
get
kicked
out
of
this
training
camp
nancy
said
i
don
t
like
her
attitude
one
neither
do
the
instructors
but
she
s
got
an
uncle
who
s
a
colonel
or
he
s
one
of
the
bigwigs
in
the
training
i
don
t
imagine
that
will
have
any
influence
if
she
doesn
t
make
the
grade
nancy
replied
i
d
hate
to
think
of
the
kind
of
army
we
d
have
if
it
you
may
be
right
mabel
conceded
but
what
s
more
i
don
t
even
like
her
name
it
s
much
too
i
think
we
ought
to
be
careful
about
things
like
that
warned
nancy
there
re
plenty
of
good
loyal
americans
you
know
with
yes
of
course
but
when
a
foreign
name
goes
along
with
a
rebellious
attitude
it
makes
you
something
happened
a
week
later
to
make
the
two
girls
think
more
seriously
than
ever
of
tini
hoffman
and
her
strange
conduct
after
their
eight
hours
of
work
the
nurses
were
free
to
seek
recreation
go
into
the
village
on
shopping
tours
or
to
movies
and
they
were
usually
ready
for
a
change
when
their
day
s
work
was
over
one
evening
nancy
and
mabel
had
stopped
in
a
drugstore
for
a
soda
after
going
to
the
movies
and
they
came
unexpectedly
upon
tini
the
drugstore
they
had
entered
was
very
narrow
in
the
rear
with
little
private
booths
down
each
wall
and
an
aisle
in
between
for
serving
the
girls
slipped
into
one
of
the
booths
to
have
their
soda
and
chat
about
the
picture
couples
filled
all
the
other
seats
and
crowded
around
the
tables
in
front
most
of
them
were
men
and
women
in
uniform
we
re
lucky
to
get
seats
said
mabel
while
waiting
for
their
order
to
be
filled
nancy
said
oh
i
meant
to
get
some
cleansing
i
ll
get
em
for
you
offered
mabel
i
promised
to
pick
up
a
package
here
for
miss
hauser
she
phoned
her
order
while
mabel
was
at
the
drug
counter
nancy
sat
idly
gazing
around
at
the
chatting
groups
then
suddenly
she
noticed
tini
hoffman
directly
across
the
aisle
tini
was
so
busy
talking
to
a
man
in
civilian
clothes
that
she
hadn
t
noticed
her
dormitory
mates
she
sat
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
her
hands
folded
under
her
dimpled
chin
while
her
blond
countenance
beamed
on
her
companion
nancy
felt
sure
tini
s
hair
was
bleached
and
wondered
what
it
would
look
like
after
several
months
in
the
pacific
islands
it
was
too
to
be
natural
it
proved
amusing
to
find
tini
so
pleased
with
her
situation
for
once
so
fascinated
was
nancy
in
watching
tini
that
mabel
was
returning
before
she
gave
the
gentleman
opposite
tini
a
fleeting
glance
then
suddenly
her
eyes
became
fixed
where
had
she
seen
that
lean
profile
before
she
tried
to
hold
herself
under
control
as
her
mind
tied
up
the
loose
ends
of
memory
the
longer
she
stared
the
more
positive
she
became
that
the
glasses
and
small
mustache
belonged
to
the
same
man
who
had
sat
beside
the
blond
corporal
the
day
she
left
her
home
town
though
she
had
had
only
a
hasty
glance
as
she
went
down
the
aisle
of
the
train
those
faces
had
become
indelibly
impressed
upon
her
mind
as
mabel
came
nearer
nancy
saw
tini
s
companion
watching
covertly
she
couldn
t
blame
any
man
for
being
attracted
by
mabel
for
she
was
really
worth
looking
at
in
her
trimly
fitting
uniform
with
her
cap
sitting
jauntily
on
her
golden
curls
but
the
man
s
glance
had
little
admiration
in
it
only
a
sort
of
cynical
calculation
nancy
felt
she
must
know
if
he
was
really
the
blond
corporal
s
train
mate
impulsively
she
said
as
mabel
handed
her
the
package
she
had
bought
she
deliberately
used
the
german
word
for
thank
you
and
spoke
loud
enough
to
be
heard
across
the
aisle
her
trick
brought
the
expected
result
for
the
man
turned
sharply
toward
her
mabel
glided
into
the
seat
opposite
and
glanced
at
her
with
a
puzzled
frown
when
it
was
too
late
for
regrets
nancy
felt
the
hot
blood
welling
to
her
face
others
may
have
heard
her
too
and
what
would
they
think
illustration
discovered
tini
across
the
there
was
even
a
chance
that
the
man
might
recognize
her
as
the
same
girl
who
had
sat
in
front
of
them
on
the
train
even
though
she
had
worn
a
green
suit
then
and
was
now
clad
in
olive
drab
at
least
she
thought
ruefully
i
could
swear
he
s
the
same
man
but
what
s
he
doing
here
with
tini
hoffman
mabel
had
to
speak
to
her
twice
before
she
heeded
they
make
grand
sodas
here
don
t
they
sure
do
nancy
stuck
a
couple
of
straws
in
hers
so
hard
they
bent
double
what
s
wrong
asked
mabel
under
her
breath
nancy
glanced
warily
at
the
couple
across
the
aisle
nudged
mabel
with
her
foot
and
laid
her
finger
cautiously
on
her
lips
before
she
placed
the
fresh
straws
in
her
glass
mabel
wisely
changed
the
subject
and
remarked
cleansing
tissues
are
sure
hard
to
get
now
guess
we
ll
have
to
get
all
ours
hereafter
at
the
we
ll
need
plenty
to
take
we
get
to
go
yeah
my
friend
lydia
in
north
africa
wrote
me
we
d
better
take
along
plenty
of
stuff
like
suddenly
nancy
was
impatient
to
be
through
with
their
sodas
and
out
of
the
drugstore
she
meant
to
take
no
chances
on
suspects
this
time
but
report
what
she
had
seen
to
captain
lewis
she
finished
her
soda
in
a
hurry
and
reached
to
the
back
of
the
table
for
her
purse
let
s
get
going
she
suggested
not
till
i
finish
the
last
spoonful
of
this
ice
cream
mabel
said
firmly
i
d
think
about
it
regretfully
every
time
i
m
marooned
somewhere
on
a
desert
over
then
i
ll
go
ahead
and
be
what
s
all
the
hurry
mabel
wanted
to
know
an
edge
in
her
tone
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
nancy
saw
that
the
sleek
gentleman
across
the
aisle
was
watching
them
then
she
noticed
that
tini
s
attention
had
wandered
sufficiently
from
her
companion
to
recognize
them
hiya
she
said
with
a
proud
toss
of
her
head
which
plainly
showed
her
personal
triumph
over
their
dateless
condition
nancy
returned
the
greeting
and
led
the
way
out
when
they
were
on
the
street
mabel
slipped
her
arm
through
nancy
s
and
inquired
what
s
wrong
you
acted
as
though
you
were
sitting
on
nettles
would
have
been
mild
to
the
prickles
i
what
do
you
mean
that
man
with
tini
looked
exactly
like
the
one
who
was
with
the
blond
corporal
i
told
you
about
on
the
oh
so
that
s
why
you
thanked
me
in
german
of
course
i
wanted
to
see
if
i
could
get
a
reaction
out
of
and
did
you
i
ll
say
he
shot
a
glance
at
me
as
if
i
d
poked
him
in
the
mabel
grunted
don
t
see
where
that
proves
anything
anybody
using
german
words
in
these
times
should
surely
make
people
sit
up
and
take
but
i
could
swear
he
s
the
same
mabel
glasses
small
mustache
lean
face
and
a
very
immaculate
tailored
look
about
his
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
go
straight
to
captain
lewis
i
m
taking
no
chances
again
even
if
it
gets
tini
into
she
may
be
working
with
she
s
certainly
acted
in
a
way
to
make
us
suspicious
agreed
nancy
oh
she
s
always
acted
like
the
backs
of
those
over
her
i
never
paid
much
attention
to
that
she
s
an
only
child
very
spoiled
her
parents
have
oodles
of
then
she
didn
t
have
to
take
nurse
s
a
way
to
make
a
mabel
laughed
significantly
again
at
the
time
she
went
in
she
was
in
love
with
one
of
the
hospital
internes
it
gave
her
a
chance
to
be
with
him
evidently
she
didn
t
get
she
sure
didn
t
soon
after
he
got
settled
with
his
practice
he
married
a
real
sweet
girl
by
that
time
tini
was
so
nearly
through
her
training
she
couldn
t
quit
without
causing
lots
of
strange
for
her
to
take
on
the
hardships
of
the
army
nurse
she
wanted
to
get
away
from
home
and
the
catty
people
who
enjoyed
her
being
too
bad
to
have
such
an
experience
so
young
said
nancy
suddenly
feeling
sorry
for
tini
she
surely
was
thrilled
at
having
that
new
fellow
they
were
moving
into
the
throng
at
the
bus
stop
now
and
fell
silent
for
they
had
been
warned
about
too
much
talk
within
the
hearing
of
others
spies
can
find
meaning
in
your
most
innocent
remarks
major
reed
had
warned
them
they
couldn
t
find
seats
together
anyhow
so
the
girls
rode
in
silence
back
to
the
camp
quite
a
number
of
other
nurses
were
coming
back
to
the
camp
on
the
same
bus
but
nancy
was
glad
not
to
sit
with
any
of
them
for
she
wanted
to
think
about
what
she
would
say
to
captain
lewis
when
she
went
straight
on
to
their
room
with
mabel
her
friend
said
thought
you
were
going
to
report
what
you
saw
to
cap
n
i
didn
t
want
any
of
the
others
to
see
me
going
to
her
explained
nancy
i
ll
wait
a
few
minutes
till
they
re
all
in
their
rooms
this
thing
is
best
kept
under
sure
i
agree
with
tini
s
made
enough
enemies
without
adding
suspicion
to
her
when
the
halls
were
empty
nancy
slipped
downstairs
miss
lewis
s
bedroom
was
next
to
her
office
but
to
her
consternation
she
found
all
the
lights
out
she
hesitated
to
wake
her
yet
didn
t
want
to
wait
till
morning
to
make
her
revelations
over
and
over
again
she
had
been
haunted
by
the
idea
that
the
train
wreck
might
have
been
averted
if
those
passengers
had
been
apprehended
in
time
yet
she
still
couldn
t
see
what
she
might
have
done
about
it
but
this
time
she
did
know
what
to
do
and
she
meant
to
do
it
she
was
still
hesitating
in
the
hall
when
she
noticed
a
light
in
an
office
farther
down
and
heard
men
talking
suddenly
she
recognized
major
reed
s
hearty
laughter
the
hours
they
had
worked
together
that
night
at
the
wreck
had
made
him
seem
so
human
and
likeable
to
nancy
that
their
difference
in
station
could
never
again
be
a
barrier
to
understanding
eagerly
she
hurried
toward
his
office
the
door
stood
open
she
paused
in
the
doorway
till
her
eyes
came
to
rest
on
the
major
among
the
group
of
men
may
i
speak
to
you
major
reed
she
asked
he
glanced
at
her
surprised
then
asked
anything
wrong
miss
dale
he
crushed
his
cigarette
into
an
ash
tray
before
he
moved
toward
the
door
i
meant
to
talk
to
captain
lewis
but
her
lights
were
out
nancy
explained
as
she
backed
into
the
hall
indicating
that
their
conversation
must
be
private
i
must
speak
to
yes
he
said
when
they
were
outside
and
the
door
was
closed
what
s
wrong
i
think
i
just
saw
the
man
who
was
with
the
corporal
that
day
on
the
where
in
a
drugstore
in
the
village
i
don
t
want
him
to
get
away
as
the
blond
man
the
blond
didn
t
stated
major
reed
with
a
chuckle
the
fbi
now
have
him
in
their
not
really
exclaimed
nancy
her
face
lighting
yes
it
will
be
some
time
before
he
s
in
circulation
again
if
ever
but
this
d
you
say
you
saw
him
nancy
gave
a
hurried
report
of
her
encounter
with
the
suspect
and
tini
in
the
drugstore
while
she
talked
the
major
stroked
his
chin
and
stared
at
the
floor
i
see
you
say
he
was
dating
miss
hoffman
i
haven
t
any
idea
where
she
met
him
of
major
reed
glanced
at
his
watch
you
came
in
on
the
last
bus
he
asked
yes
i
did
tini
hoffman
come
with
you
i
don
t
think
so
in
fact
i
m
sure
the
bunch
of
us
came
up
from
the
bus
stop
then
she
ll
have
to
come
on
the
next
bus
or
be
late
checking
he
was
silent
a
moment
then
spoke
again
as
if
thinking
aloud
he
would
already
have
put
her
on
the
camp
bus
before
anyone
could
make
it
to
town
in
a
car
to
follow
nancy
admitted
this
was
true
it
seemed
too
late
to
put
anyone
on
his
trail
tonight
tini
will
probably
be
dating
him
again
she
said
she
seemed
tickled
pink
with
major
reed
dug
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
and
admitted
yes
that
seems
the
surest
chance
but
i
can
t
ask
you
to
act
as
a
spy
against
one
of
your
fellow
nor
do
i
want
any
such
position
stated
nancy
frankly
but
where
the
welfare
of
our
unit
or
our
country
is
involved
major
reed
i
fear
we
have
no
he
looked
her
squarely
in
the
eyes
then
with
frank
admiration
you
have
a
wise
head
on
your
shoulders
miss
dale
if
anything
else
comes
up
let
me
they
heard
the
last
busload
of
girls
out
front
long
after
mabel
and
nancy
were
already
in
bed
it
was
so
much
later
than
nancy
expected
major
reed
might
after
all
have
reached
the
bus
station
in
time
to
see
their
suspect
put
tini
aboard
she
wondered
what
he
had
done
about
it
chapter
four
the
gas
chamber
the
following
morning
a
scheduled
lecture
on
military
law
was
postponed
for
an
impromptu
talk
by
major
reed
nancy
s
heart
skipped
a
beat
when
lieutenant
hauser
introduced
the
major
to
the
assembled
unit
instinctively
she
felt
his
appearance
had
something
to
do
with
what
she
had
told
him
last
night
and
she
was
right
he
talked
to
them
for
an
hour
on
the
subtle
ways
in
which
the
enemy
succeeded
in
getting
information
he
admonished
the
nurses
about
silence
in
public
places
and
prohibited
discussion
outside
the
camp
grounds
about
what
was
going
on
inside
he
warned
them
against
picking
up
conversations
with
strange
men
who
might
craftily
get
information
from
them
he
finished
his
talk
by
giving
a
actual
incidents
where
absolutely
loyal
men
and
women
had
witlessly
supplied
the
enemy
with
vital
information
this
is
for
your
protection
as
well
as
for
our
boys
out
there
on
the
battlefronts
he
told
them
i
warn
you
to
make
no
close
contacts
with
as
the
girls
filed
out
of
the
lecture
room
there
was
awe
in
their
whispered
remarks
most
of
them
felt
more
keenly
than
ever
the
responsibilities
of
the
task
ahead
as
they
went
to
the
grounds
for
instructions
in
using
gas
masks
ida
hall
and
tini
hoffman
were
close
to
nancy
and
mabel
i
noticed
you
had
a
mighty
date
last
night
nancy
heard
ida
saying
to
tini
where
d
you
pick
him
up
i
didn
t
pick
him
up
retorted
tini
i
met
him
in
recently
when
i
was
on
vacation
after
finishing
my
nurse
s
oh
i
ida
s
manner
showed
she
didn
t
like
tini
any
more
than
most
of
the
others
you
surely
can
t
accuse
him
of
trying
to
pick
me
up
tini
flared
fully
aware
of
the
implications
in
ida
s
remarks
following
so
close
on
that
lecture
he
encouraged
me
to
come
into
the
anc
in
fact
he
was
the
very
one
who
suggested
you
must
have
made
a
hit
with
him
put
in
nancy
to
have
him
come
all
the
way
over
here
to
see
tini
looked
pleased
and
toyed
with
her
blond
curls
before
she
said
well
you
see
he
s
a
traveling
salesman
and
gets
huh
he
must
be
luckier
than
most
if
he
can
still
get
gas
to
be
a
traveling
salesman
commented
mabel
oh
he
uses
the
trains
his
territory
is
too
wide
for
a
car
in
these
nancy
smiled
disarmingly
as
she
asked
trying
to
seem
casual
dating
him
tonight
if
he
can
arrange
his
business
so
he
can
be
back
in
the
there
was
no
more
time
for
probing
for
their
instructor
sergeant
fuller
was
calling
them
to
attention
on
the
hill
where
they
had
already
received
their
preliminary
instruction
in
putting
on
and
taking
off
their
gas
masks
the
structure
of
the
masks
had
been
explained
in
detail
and
a
lecture
given
on
the
various
types
of
gas
and
how
to
care
for
gas
casualties
this
morning
however
came
their
first
really
difficult
test
they
had
to
go
through
the
gas
chamber
as
they
called
the
little
house
on
the
hill
where
the
tests
were
made
gosh
i
ll
sure
be
glad
when
this
is
over
moaned
a
small
girl
grace
warner
whom
they
had
dubbed
grace
actually
looked
no
more
than
sixteen
and
wore
her
hair
with
a
which
made
her
round
childish
face
seem
even
more
immature
her
voice
too
had
a
thin
babyish
quality
though
the
nurses
teased
her
quite
a
bit
she
was
a
general
favorite
shorty
was
between
nancy
and
mabel
when
they
lined
up
for
the
test
her
big
brown
eyes
were
apprehensive
as
she
looked
at
nancy
and
said
if
we
could
go
through
there
once
and
have
it
over
with
i
wouldn
t
mind
so
much
but
three
the
first
won
t
be
so
hard
nancy
said
consolingly
we
just
walk
through
the
front
door
and
out
the
be
sure
our
masks
don
t
leak
or
only
tear
gas
anyhow
mabel
added
it
s
not
nearly
so
bad
as
the
that
s
what
you
think
said
shorty
one
of
our
nurses
back
home
said
she
got
badly
burned
about
the
neck
and
wrists
when
she
took
the
she
probably
wasn
t
as
snugly
protected
as
we
are
that
s
why
they
make
our
shirts
now
with
the
extra
protection
flaps
at
the
cuffs
and
front
no
skin
exposed
explained
mabel
the
nurses
stood
in
line
their
gas
masks
on
already
they
could
hear
laughter
and
nervous
giggles
on
the
other
side
as
the
first
of
the
group
marched
through
and
came
out
triumphantly
to
take
off
their
masks
till
time
for
the
next
test
nancy
and
her
friends
didn
t
mind
the
first
test
so
much
though
they
were
glad
enough
to
hurry
out
the
back
door
on
the
second
trip
they
went
in
with
their
gas
masks
on
took
them
off
inside
then
hurried
out
illustration
i
ll
be
glad
when
this
is
over
moaned
oh
boy
is
this
fresh
air
good
exclaimed
nancy
when
she
rushed
out
the
back
door
it
was
awful
wailed
shorty
my
face
is
stinging
all
over
i
wouldn
t
go
in
there
again
for
anything
but
you
have
to
stated
nancy
the
hardest
test
is
yet
to
i
can
t
i
just
can
t
wailed
shorty
her
cheeks
wet
with
tears
that
had
not
all
been
caused
by
the
stinging
gas
if
you
don
t
go
through
it
you
ll
never
get
overseas
nancy
warned
her
i
don
t
see
why
they
put
us
through
all
this
misery
wailed
shorty
we
know
how
to
put
on
gas
masks
in
case
there
s
any
trouble
over
yonder
no
sense
in
torturing
ourselves
like
this
when
we
may
never
have
to
put
em
on
nancy
caught
shorty
by
the
shoulders
and
shook
her
slightly
now
you
cut
out
that
kind
of
talk
or
they
ll
not
let
you
go
down
under
with
come
on
warned
mabel
it
s
our
turn
nancy
caught
shorty
s
hand
come
on
honey
she
said
in
a
wheedling
tone
we
ll
go
through
nancy
herself
had
really
dreaded
this
final
ordeal
but
having
to
bolster
shorty
s
confidence
left
her
little
thought
for
her
own
fears
she
shoved
her
little
friend
through
the
door
saying
now
put
on
the
shorty
already
had
her
mask
over
her
face
when
nancy
followed
through
the
door
in
spite
of
their
speed
their
trembling
hands
fumbled
a
bit
before
the
masks
could
be
put
into
place
and
so
they
felt
a
bit
of
stinging
when
they
were
securely
masked
however
nancy
urged
the
excited
girl
toward
the
back
door
it
wasn
t
so
bad
after
all
was
it
asked
nancy
after
she
jerked
her
mask
off
and
filled
her
lungs
with
fresh
air
could
ve
been
worse
but
i
guess
i
never
would
have
got
through
at
all
nancy
if
you
hadn
t
made
me
shorty
admitted
in
a
shamefaced
manner
hope
we
don
t
ever
have
to
use
these
for
the
real
thing
mabel
said
i
heard
a
major
just
returned
from
overseas
tell
about
how
the
japs
often
cry
wolf
about
gas
said
nancy
sitting
on
the
brown
pine
carpet
with
the
others
to
rest
a
bit
what
do
you
wolf
asked
shorty
when
our
men
are
coming
ashore
from
the
landing
craft
the
japs
often
throw
up
a
and
cry
gas
they
say
there
s
nothing
breaks
the
men
s
morale
easier
than
the
fear
of
gas
nancy
explained
that
s
just
too
horrible
to
conceive
of
said
ida
hall
at
least
it
s
consoling
to
know
it
hasn
t
been
used
so
far
put
in
mabel
no
telling
what
they
ll
do
at
the
desperate
end
nancy
warned
them
i
don
t
mean
to
miss
a
trick
in
these
i
heard
we
ll
have
to
go
through
the
gas
chamber
again
at
the
port
of
embarkation
ida
hall
informed
them
good
night
flared
shorty
as
if
three
times
would
not
be
these
masks
belong
at
the
training
center
they
ll
issue
us
new
ones
at
the
port
we
have
to
test
them
out
ida
explained
the
weather
had
turned
warm
and
nancy
was
glad
to
get
back
to
their
quarters
and
have
a
good
shower
when
the
day
s
classes
and
drills
were
over
mail
came
twice
a
day
and
the
nurses
always
haunted
their
boxes
right
after
breakfast
and
just
before
the
evening
meal
nancy
talked
with
her
parents
every
sunday
over
telephone
and
had
letters
from
them
and
friends
back
home
almost
every
day
letters
had
never
meant
so
much
to
her
in
all
her
life
she
could
now
appreciate
how
important
they
were
to
tommy
and
the
other
boys
out
there
that
evening
nancy
was
thrilled
to
find
a
letter
from
tommy
which
had
been
sent
on
from
home
one
from
the
south
pacific
she
cried
waving
the
letter
at
mabel
who
was
just
opening
her
own
box
and
i
have
one
from
my
jake
exclaimed
mabel
what
a
day
for
the
long
and
short
of
our
unit
the
girls
moved
out
of
the
milling
crowd
at
the
mail
boxes
and
opened
their
letters
near
a
window
nancy
stopped
in
the
midst
of
her
reading
to
tell
mabel
joyfully
he
has
only
a
few
more
missions
to
fly
and
then
he
ll
be
coming
home
now
wouldn
t
that
be
something
if
i
got
sent
out
there
while
he
comes
back
surely
fate
wouldn
t
play
you
such
a
mean
trick
as
that
nancy
is
your
sweetie
all
right
asked
nancy
he
is
now
but
the
poor
chap
s
been
in
the
hospital
he
didn
t
say
what
for
isn
t
that
just
like
a
man
better
watch
out
he
may
fall
for
some
of
those
if
he
s
that
fickle
i
d
rather
know
it
now
mabel
said
with
a
toss
of
her
head
but
really
i
m
not
uneasy
jake
s
sold
on
my
red
head
there
aren
t
so
many
redheads
you
he
d
better
not
go
to
turkey
then
they
tell
me
there
re
plenty
of
dames
there
put
in
one
of
the
nurses
near
by
who
had
overheard
their
conversation
nancy
finished
her
letters
and
while
waiting
for
mabel
she
noticed
tini
standing
not
far
from
them
there
was
a
scowl
on
her
face
as
she
impatiently
tapped
her
fingers
on
the
window
ledge
a
slit
envelope
and
an
open
letter
were
in
her
hands
nancy
couldn
t
help
noticing
the
return
address
on
the
envelope
hotel
bad
news
asked
nancy
my
date
had
to
leave
unexpectedly
tini
replied
makes
me
sick
you
ve
been
lucky
to
have
him
here
at
all
nancy
said
most
of
us
have
been
dateless
for
three
huh
i
always
have
dates
wherever
i
sure
you
re
different
mabel
said
sarcastically
her
long
acquaintance
with
tini
left
little
patience
with
her
superior
attitude
the
rest
of
us
made
up
our
minds
when
we
came
into
the
army
nurse
corps
to
give
personal
consideration
second
place
for
the
zat
so
snapped
tini
rudely
turning
her
back
nancy
and
mabel
exchanged
significant
glances
as
they
left
for
the
mess
hall
as
nancy
ate
her
appetizing
dinner
she
thought
over
what
she
had
just
learned
she
felt
actually
sick
at
heart
over
this
unpleasant
business
of
suspecting
a
fellow
student
she
had
no
desire
to
be
a
spy
yet
when
she
recalled
the
horrible
scenes
at
that
wreck
caused
by
sabotage
she
shivered
she
would
never
forget
the
dead
and
dying
she
had
ministered
to
that
awful
morning
as
much
as
she
hated
the
unpleasant
position
into
which
circumstances
had
again
thrust
her
nancy
was
determined
to
let
no
squeamishness
make
her
keep
silent
she
had
no
choice
but
to
report
what
she
had
just
learned
about
tini
s
date
to
major
reed
if
the
man
was
really
an
enemy
spy
he
must
not
be
allowed
to
escape
again
chapter
five
official
notice
nancy
excused
herself
before
mabel
and
her
friends
had
finished
eating
and
left
the
mess
hall
she
found
major
reed
alone
this
time
sitting
at
his
desk
she
was
not
unmindful
of
the
brightening
of
his
face
when
he
saw
her
he
was
such
a
large
man
he
seemed
older
than
he
really
was
nancy
had
at
first
thought
he
was
about
thirty
but
now
he
seemed
nearer
he
had
gone
far
for
one
so
young
come
in
miss
nancy
he
said
cordially
he
jumped
up
and
placed
a
chair
for
her
then
closed
the
door
you
have
more
information
it
may
or
may
not
be
important
she
told
him
a
little
sadly
frankly
major
reed
i
don
t
like
this
business
of
reporting
on
a
fellow
i
dare
not
hide
what
i
i
fully
appreciate
the
awkwardness
of
the
situation
he
said
with
understanding
but
these
are
really
times
that
try
men
s
souls
we
have
to
do
many
things
differently
i
ll
say
she
agreed
i
was
just
reading
here
said
the
major
indicating
a
magazine
he
had
put
down
at
her
entrance
that
our
says
the
time
is
past
when
we
must
see
no
evil
hear
no
evil
and
tell
no
evil
we
must
do
all
three
until
evil
is
wiped
out
right
now
you
are
in
a
peculiar
position
and
the
only
one
on
whom
i
can
i
ll
try
not
to
betray
your
trust
she
said
i
learned
just
now
that
tini
s
friend
had
been
staying
at
hotel
carlton
over
in
the
city
i
m
afraid
he
s
already
left
there
he
wrote
her
he
had
to
leave
suddenly
the
major
s
hearty
laughter
filled
the
little
room
so
he
got
wise
to
the
fact
that
he
was
being
watched
you
already
knew
he
was
staying
there
major
reed
became
wary
we
had
a
line
on
but
how
asked
nancy
tini
did
come
in
on
that
next
bus
the
other
night
nobody
here
had
time
to
get
into
the
village
and
follow
him
after
he
put
tini
on
the
i
acted
on
your
information
promptly
there
s
such
a
thing
as
the
telephone
he
reminded
nancy
he
made
this
unsatisfactory
explanation
with
a
finality
that
told
her
she
must
inquire
no
further
into
his
end
of
the
business
have
you
learned
anything
else
he
asked
yes
tini
told
us
she
met
him
in
charleston
he
s
a
traveling
salesman
uses
the
trains
instead
of
a
car
he
suggested
that
tini
join
the
army
nurse
so
major
reed
s
dark
eyebrows
lifted
slightly
mabel
larsen
took
nurse
s
training
in
the
same
hospital
with
her
she
said
tini
went
into
it
originally
because
she
was
crazy
about
one
of
the
internes
but
that
may
be
only
gossip
for
it
does
sound
mean
i
m
afraid
tini
isn
t
very
well
major
reed
was
abstractedly
making
crosses
on
a
scrap
of
paper
finally
his
pencil
stopped
and
he
looked
squarely
across
at
nancy
has
miss
hoffman
done
anything
to
make
you
feel
she
has
gotten
on
the
inside
merely
to
supply
information
to
our
enemies
that
s
a
stiff
question
i
know
it
is
but
you
re
in
a
better
position
to
judge
of
such
things
than
any
of
the
tini
gripes
a
lot
about
regulations
and
the
hardships
of
the
military
training
but
mabel
said
she
was
always
complaining
during
her
nurse
s
training
she
s
an
only
child
her
family
has
plenty
of
money
and
she
s
rather
spoiled
all
those
things
have
to
be
taken
into
nancy
saw
the
ghost
of
a
smile
flicker
around
the
major
s
nice
lips
then
he
said
but
you
ve
evaded
my
oh
no
i
m
not
trying
to
evade
because
i
honestly
don
t
think
tini
has
the
makings
of
a
spy
i
think
she
s
motivated
entirely
by
selfishness
she
would
be
horribly
bored
here
without
ll
go
with
most
anybody
rather
than
be
i
suppose
with
a
little
flattery
a
man
could
wheedle
a
good
bit
out
of
you
may
be
right
nancy
conceded
she
rose
to
leave
and
he
stood
up
all
this
has
been
a
great
help
he
told
her
but
keep
in
mind
it
s
still
between
us
she
was
almost
at
the
door
when
he
added
and
by
the
notice
has
just
been
put
on
the
bulletin
board
that
will
interest
oh
are
we
going
to
be
sent
overseas
soon
he
laughed
again
you
re
optimistic
some
nurses
have
been
waiting
to
go
over
for
a
year
or
more
and
here
you
re
expecting
to
go
in
a
few
it
has
been
done
nancy
came
back
promptly
oh
major
reed
if
they
d
only
send
me
to
the
south
pacific
in
a
hurry
i
have
a
brother
out
there
who
s
almost
finished
his
flying
missions
if
i
get
there
before
he
comes
back
i
may
have
a
chance
to
see
just
keep
your
shirt
on
he
told
her
you
ll
probably
get
into
the
thick
of
it
before
it
s
all
over
i
m
afraid
there
s
more
than
we
dreamed
of
ahead
that
notice
out
there
says
you
re
to
get
a
taste
of
tent
life
starting
oh
that
s
really
to
my
liking
exclaimed
nancy
she
hurried
away
to
find
mabel
and
tell
her
the
news
on
sunday
just
before
supper
nancy
and
mabel
were
packed
to
start
off
by
army
truck
at
dawn
next
morning
it
was
exciting
to
put
into
practice
their
instructions
about
packing
compactly
for
travel
for
they
were
to
move
on
now
as
if
they
were
going
into
a
combat
area
seems
like
the
real
thing
said
mabel
eagerly
they
had
had
their
supper
and
were
ready
for
bed
early
when
they
heard
a
knock
on
their
door
it
proved
to
be
lieutenant
hauser
call
for
you
miss
dale
she
said
when
they
opened
the
door
nancy
stood
stunned
for
a
moment
her
arrangement
with
the
folks
back
home
was
that
she
would
call
them
every
sunday
at
two
o
clock
as
long
as
phone
calls
of
that
kind
were
permissible
she
had
talked
with
her
mother
and
father
only
a
few
hours
ago
though
she
had
not
been
able
to
tell
them
she
was
moving
on
to
another
address
they
would
have
to
be
informed
about
that
later
when
the
unit
had
arrived
safely
to
have
them
call
back
like
this
alarmed
her
she
knew
no
one
else
who
would
call
her
by
telephone
here
she
said
you
had
a
call
mabel
repeated
when
nancy
still
stood
where
she
had
received
the
message
but
why
would
they
be
calling
back
nancy
wanted
to
know
oh
come
on
gal
exclaimed
mabel
wrapping
her
housecoat
around
her
and
taking
nancy
s
arm
how
will
you
ever
face
all
those
bombs
if
you
get
so
scared
over
a
little
telephone
bell
ringing
nancy
could
think
only
that
something
terrible
must
have
happened
to
her
parents
she
let
mabel
lead
her
like
a
to
the
phone
in
lieutenant
hauser
s
office
hello
is
nancy
oh
dad
that
you
i
was
afraid
something
was
wrong
with
you
or
mabel
could
hear
dale
s
deep
voice
as
she
stood
close
to
nancy
no
we
re
all
right
but
we
had
upsetting
news
just
now
from
the
from
the
mean
about
tommy
asked
nancy

been
missing
in
action
over
enemy
territory
since
the
second
of
oh

wailed
nancy
it

just
can
t
god

t
let
anything

if

came
the
firm
voice
confidently
over
the
wire
you

on
praying
like
we
ve
been
doing
all
along
and
he
ll
be
taken
care
oh

wish

for
me
said
nancy
and
tell
her
i
ll
pray
harder
than
nancy
put
down
the
phone
and
faced
mabel
i
could
hear
what
he
said
her
friend
told
her
gently
don
t
give
up
hope
nancy
lots
of
times
they
turn
up
after
they
re
reported
missing
maybe
he
s
not
oh
no
he
s
not
nancy
asserted
firmly
i
m
not
going
to
think
of
it
for
a
minute
he
wrote
me
in
that
last
letter
he
could
feel
our
prayers
helping
protect
him
and
he
s
going
to
feel
it
more
than
ever
from
sunrise
till
the
following
day
the
convoy
rolled
smoothly
west
along
the
paved
highway
at
noon
they
stopped
in
a
large
city
to
eat
a
lunch
the
canteen
girls
had
prepared
it
was
good
to
get
out
and
stretch
their
legs
after
sitting
on
the
hard
truck
seats
all
morning
no
one
knew
where
they
were
going
or
how
long
they
would
be
on
their
way
so
the
nurses
made
the
best
of
their
hour
s
rest
they
took
turns
in
the
canteen
dressing
room
freshening
up
to
continue
their
journey
while
they
rested
nancy
slipped
her
brother
s
last
letter
from
her
pocket
and
it
mabel
caught
her
at
it
and
tried
to
cheer
her
come
on
now
she
said
it
does
no
good
i
m
not
grieving
makes
me
feel
more
certain
he
s
going
to
come
out
all
right
when
i
his
let
s
take
a
sprint
around
the
block
suggested
mabel
we
have
a
few
minutes
before
we
take
not
a
bad
idea
a
little
exercise
will
do
us
we
may
never
get
a
peep
at
this
burg
again
i
sure
don
t
mean
to
miss
anything
on
the
other
girls
were
out
pacing
up
and
down
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
canteen
but
nancy
and
mabel
wanted
to
see
more
they
were
in
the
heart
of
town
and
the
street
back
of
the
canteen
had
many
attractive
shop
windows
nancy
kept
glancing
at
her
watch
as
they
paused
to
admire
the
pretty
dresses
do
you
feel
like
someone
who
s
renounced
the
world
when
you
look
at
those
dresses
asked
mabel
oh
well
it
won
t
be
forever
nancy
said
consolingly
at
least
we
can
still
wear
evening
dresses
for
dances
on
the
post
miss
hauser
yeah
that
will
be
a
slight
morale
i
never
felt
more
smartly
dressed
than
i
do
in
this
uniform
continued
nancy
i
must
admit
they
do
look
rather
stunning
mabel
agreed
the
next
store
carried
drugs
and
they
were
about
to
pass
by
when
nancy
seized
mabel
s
arm
say
that
looks
like
tini
in
there
mabel
stepped
back
and
looked
in
sure
is
come
on
i
ll
get
some
dental
floss
and
see
what
she
s
up
as
they
went
in
tini
s
back
was
toward
them
she
sat
on
a
stool
at
the
soda
counter
drinking
a
coke
why
had
she
come
here
for
a
coke
when
they
had
all
the
cold
drinks
they
wanted
back
at
the
canteen
tini
was
leaning
across
the
counter
turning
her
charm
on
the
soda
jerker
who
was
at
least
five
years
her
junior
what
was
she
up
to
now
nancy
wondered
chapter
six
camouflage
nancy
was
not
too
surprised
when
she
found
tini
having
a
whispered
conversation
with
the
soda
jerker
in
the
strange
town
tini
seemed
always
involved
in
some
undercurrent
she
glanced
at
her
watch
and
saw
they
had
only
five
minutes
before
the
transport
was
due
to
move
on
we
ve
got
to
beat
it
she
told
mabel
better
come
along
tini
or
you
ll
be
left
behind
warned
mabel
as
they
went
toward
the
door
tini
threw
her
money
on
the
counter
and
overtook
the
girls
don
t
see
why
you
wanted
a
coke
round
here
when
we
had
plenty
of
free
ones
at
the
canteen
mabel
said
oh
just
an
excuse
to
talk
to
the
clerk
i
wanted
to
ask
him
if
carl
benton
had
been
here
carl
benton
repeated
nancy
as
they
almost
ran
toward
their
trucks
you
mean
that
fellow
you
dated
back
yonder
sure
he
sells
supplies
said
he
came
through
here
did
that
chap
know
him
asked
nancy
dumb
he
s
only
had
that
job
a
few
surely
you
ve
heard
from
him
since
he
left
said
mabel
not
without
an
acid
flavor
in
her
tone
you
bet
but
i
thought
if
he
was
around
this
way
i
might
get
a
chance
to
see
him
may
as
well
put
him
out
of
your
mind
nancy
suggested
gal
if
my
hunch
is
right
we
won
t
be
doing
any
dating
till
we
get
through
some
maneuvers
ahead
of
us
said
mabel
toward
sunset
it
began
to
look
as
though
mabel
s
hunch
had
some
material
foundation
they
turned
off
the
paved
highway
and
bumped
for
five
miles
over
a
rutted
clay
road
before
they
entered
a
swamp
made
shadowy
by
the
spanish
moss
that
hung
from
the
oaks
cypress
and
sweet
gum
trees
though
the
nurses
were
tired
after
their
long
day
s
travel
nancy
and
mabel
exchanged
satisfied
glances
say
gal
whispered
mabel
looks
like
they
re
preparing
us
for
the
real
we
ll
sure
have
to
sleep
under
nets
down
here
or
there
won
t
be
any
snoozing
said
nancy
the
sun
had
already
gone
down
leaving
a
red
glow
in
the
west
when
the
convoy
circled
a
clearing
in
the
swamp
where
there
was
a
small
tent
village
already
set
up
the
passengers
climbed
out
gratefully
each
nurse
loaded
with
her
personal
baggage
lieutenant
hauser
called
the
roll
and
assigned
four
girls
to
each
tent
the
tents
were
numbered
so
the
nurses
hurried
off
to
see
what
their
new
homes
were
like
four
cots
and
that
s
all
exclaimed
mabel
the
first
to
reach
number
four
their
new
habitation
nancy
s
heart
had
taken
a
dive
when
she
learned
that
tini
and
her
former
ida
hall
were
to
share
the
tent
with
mabel
and
herself
had
this
been
prearranged
by
major
reed
she
wondered
she
certainly
had
no
desire
to
continue
serving
as
a
day
and
night
watchman
for
tini
hoffman
must
think
we
re
made
of
cast
iron
complained
tini
when
she
tried
out
her
cot
but
here
are
mattress
cases
said
nancy
we
can
stuff
em
with
spanish
moss
from
the
trees
and
make
grand
mattresses
we
used
to
do
that
when
dad
took
us
fishing
in
the
river
not
a
bad
idea
agreed
ida
they
took
their
casings
and
hurried
off
under
the
trees
to
fill
them
before
dark
the
suggestion
spread
and
soon
the
swamp
was
alive
with
nurses
preparing
for
a
comfortable
night
s
sleep
their
mess
hall
was
a
long
tent
in
the
center
of
the
camp
they
ate
by
lantern
light
the
food
was
all
from
cans
and
cold
but
the
nurses
were
too
hungry
that
night
to
be
critical
say
this
is
going
to
be
real
fun
said
mabel
as
they
made
their
way
back
to
their
tents
by
flashlights
though
it
was
spring
the
swampy
air
had
a
penetrating
chill
which
however
did
not
discourage
the
mosquitoes
at
all
when
we
used
to
go
camping
we
drove
away
the
pests
with
a
big
campfire
said
nancy
thinking
sadly
of
the
good
times
she
had
had
with
her
dad
tommy
and
their
friends
at
their
swamp
shack
no
fires
here
said
ida
i
heard
lieutenant
hauser
say
we
must
live
just
as
if
we
were
in
range
of
enemy
each
tent
had
one
lantern
that
hung
from
the
center
pole
under
it
nancy
nailed
a
puny
mirror
which
had
to
serve
all
of
them
in
turn
they
transformed
canned
goods
packing
boxes
into
chairs
their
individual
toilet
articles
had
to
be
fished
out
from
their
musette
bags
every
time
they
were
used
as
neither
mabel
nor
tini
had
ever
been
camping
they
had
their
initiation
that
night
in
sleeping
under
mosquito
nets
gosh
feels
like
a
prison
in
here
exclaimed
mabel
a
prison
you
ll
be
glad
to
stay
in
nancy
informed
her
when
you
hear
how
those
mosquitoes
sing
outside
long
before
day
however
each
of
the
nurses
was
rolled
in
a
blanket
under
her
net
and
the
discouraged
pests
had
returned
to
their
swamp
muck
illustration
nurses
washed
their
clothes
in
the
in
the
days
that
followed
the
nurses
discovered
what
it
meant
to
do
all
their
bathing
and
clothes
washing
in
the
shallows
along
the
river
shore
with
only
a
compass
to
guide
them
they
learned
to
cut
their
way
through
the
dense
undergrowth
of
the
river
swamp
more
than
one
rattler
had
to
be
killed
in
the
process
but
many
others
they
left
alone
as
they
had
been
given
careful
instructions
about
poisonous
snakes
and
insects
in
various
parts
of
the
world
they
crossed
streams
and
lagoons
in
high
boots
and
several
times
ate
from
their
mess
kits
the
food
they
prepared
for
themselves
on
hikes
all
nursing
work
was
suspended
while
they
were
put
through
these
physical
fitness
tests
to
nancy
s
amazement
tini
hoffman
stood
hers
along
with
the
others
for
she
seemed
to
understand
its
significance
tini
became
another
person
when
there
were
no
men
around
on
whom
to
turn
her
charms
they
had
been
camping
on
the
river
shore
only
three
days
when
at
breakfast
one
morning
they
were
given
orders
to
be
prepared
to
leave
by
noon
i
m
surely
ready
to
go
said
tini
who
sat
next
to
nancy
on
the
long
bench
at
the
table
it
s
been
an
eternity
since
we
had
any
they
seemed
so
remote
from
civilization
here
that
it
seemed
ages
to
nancy
also
since
she
had
heard
what
was
going
on
in
the
rest
of
the
world
but
their
high
hopes
proved
premature
as
they
were
not
yet
scheduled
for
city
lights
lieutenant
hauser
gave
the
orders
every
group
is
to
take
down
its
own
tent
roll
and
pack
it
according
to
previous
buzzing
with
talk
and
excitement
the
nurses
scattered
to
their
various
quarters
nancy
had
left
her
washing
on
a
bush
over
night
so
snatched
it
up
as
she
hurried
back
to
begin
packing
ten
minutes
before
twelve
all
tents
had
been
cleared
to
the
last
tent
peg
and
the
nurses
began
to
pack
their
belongings
into
the
trucks
in
which
they
had
arrived
it
was
thrilling
and
exciting
business
for
none
of
the
trainees
knew
where
the
next
stop
would
be
to
their
surprise
the
convoy
did
not
move
out
by
the
way
it
had
come
instead
it
turned
toward
the
river
the
nurses
had
discovered
no
bridges
in
all
their
hikes
up
and
down
the
small
stream
so
they
were
not
surprised
when
the
trucks
had
to
cross
the
stream
at
a
shallow
ford
for
the
first
time
they
had
a
sample
of
what
it
would
be
like
to
travel
where
there
were
no
paved
roads
and
bridges
after
leaving
the
river
the
trucks
moved
on
to
higher
ground
they
left
the
trees
behind
and
plowed
through
roads
winding
through
a
pine
forest
at
noon
they
stopped
to
eat
from
tins
under
the
sighing
pines
then
they
learned
they
were
not
on
their
way
back
to
their
original
training
center
in
about
two
hours
we
will
pitch
our
tents
again
explained
lieutenant
hauser
some
of
your
most
difficult
work
is
just
ahead
our
camp
will
have
a
public
highway
on
one
side
but
i
warn
you
to
talk
to
no
one
outside
our
unit
or
give
out
any
information
about
the
tests
you
re
going
you
mean
we
can
t
even
write
our
friends
about
what
we
ve
been
doing
on
this
trip
asked
mabel
certainly
not
too
many
times
spies
have
deduced
from
the
nature
of
a
group
s
training
what
its
overseas
destination
might
a
surprised
murmur
swept
over
the
semicircle
of
young
women
sitting
on
the
carpet
of
brown
pine
needles
nancy
wondered
about
the
letters
tini
had
written
every
day
while
they
were
in
camp
she
herself
had
written
long
descriptions
of
their
camping
life
to
her
parents
but
she
realized
now
those
letters
she
had
been
hoping
to
mail
would
have
to
be
torn
up
but
miss
hauser
was
continuing
this
period
is
a
for
actual
overseas
duty
we
must
conform
to
all
restrictions
we
would
have
overseas
duty
those
were
the
magic
words
they
had
long
wanted
to
hear
they
brought
a
joyous
outburst
from
the
eager
nurses
that
ended
in
clapping
aren
t
we
the
lucky
blokes
exclaimed
mabel
and
say
it
looks
as
though
it
s
going
to
be
in
the
tropics
nancy
whispered
when
they
rose
to
go
back
to
the
trucks
tini
began
to
complain
it
s
utterly
silly
not
letting
us
tell
anything
about
what
we
ve
been
doing
in
the
ah
gee
who
minds
that
asked
mabel
after
all
we
agreed
to
submit
ourselves
to
this
rigorous
of
course
we
did
said
nancy
i
m
sure
they
have
good
reasons
for
all
these
restrictions
you
can
never
tell
what
spies
may
make
of
the
smallest
bit
of
information
that
may
leak
when
they
were
rolling
along
again
in
their
trucks
nancy
recalled
how
tini
had
spent
all
her
spare
time
back
on
the
river
shore
writing
letters
every
night
she
had
pushed
her
cot
close
to
the
lantern
and
sat
under
her
mosquito
bar
to
finish
her
writing
with
her
usual
lack
of
consideration
for
others
she
kept
the
light
burning
till
the
tent
swarmed
with
mosquitoes
moths
and
other
insects
i
bet
she
ll
try
to
mail
those
letters
in
spite
of
what
lieutenant
hauser
said
nancy
thought
with
disgust
for
the
next
hours
however
there
was
no
time
to
dwell
on
her
tent
mate
s
tendency
to
insubordination
the
nurses
had
thought
they
had
stiff
training
in
the
swamp
but
they
truly
got
a
taste
of
real
training
when
their
journey
ended
in
the
pine
thicket
at
three
that
afternoon
no
sooner
were
the
ropes
tied
to
the
last
tent
peg
than
they
were
ordered
to
a
field
they
found
several
soldiers
with
guns
in
the
bushy
cover
on
the
edge
of
the
field
when
the
nurses
came
up
in
their
coveralls
and
shoes
sergeant
tanner
gave
them
instructions
we
re
going
to
let
you
find
out
what
it
feels
like
to
be
fleeing
with
the
enemy
firing
behind
you
he
said
a
mischievous
twinkle
in
his
brown
eyes
you
re
to
start
across
the
field
and
every
time
a
blast
of
firing
comes
you
re
to
fall
on
your
we
won
t
need
any
second
invitation
to
do
that
said
mabel
with
a
giggle
when
the
whistle
blows
that
s
your
order
to
advance
again
continued
the
sergeant
nancy
looked
at
the
guns
with
some
apprehension
she
would
be
truly
glad
when
this
was
over
shorty
was
all
again
nancy
i
ll
run
close
to
you
she
said
sure
agreed
nancy
recalling
their
trying
time
at
the
gas
chamber
somehow
i
always
feel
safer
when
you
re
at
the
signal
they
were
off
across
the
corn
stubble
left
from
last
year
s
harvest
as
a
child
nancy
had
read
how
that
other
hart
and
other
women
of
georgia
advancing
in
a
field
of
corn
stubble
had
taken
part
in
the
battle
of
kettle
creek
and
driven
the
british
from
upper
georgia
during
the
revolution
how
little
she
had
dreamed
that
she
another
nancy
six
generations
later
would
be
rehearsing
for
battle
in
a
war
for
liberty
that
encircled
the
globe
in
just
such
a
field
the
nurses
had
run
only
about
a
hundred
feet
when
there
came
a
roar
of
gunfire
behind
and
far
overhead
almost
everyone
wondered
if
her
neighbor
had
been
struck
as
she
saw
her
dive
for
the
earth
golly
moses
groaned
mabel
i
m
scared
stiff
nancy
giggled
nervously
as
she
turned
to
see
her
pal
s
forehead
smeared
with
dirt
where
she
had
tried
to
go
through
the
corn
furrow
exciting
but
awful
she
agreed
at
the
sound
of
the
whistle
they
were
off
again
over
and
over
the
gruelling
performance
was
repeated
then
they
had
to
turn
and
come
back
across
the
field
in
the
face
of
the
fire
nancy
found
this
easier
at
least
they
could
see
that
the
shots
were
going
far
above
their
heads
most
of
them
came
in
across
the
goal
line
triumphantly
though
some
were
slightly
hysterical
between
laughter
and
fear
only
two
or
three
staggered
back
tense
and
shaken
during
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
their
men
instructors
gave
them
illustrations
of
jungle
camouflage
in
the
densely
wooded
section
below
the
pine
thicket
and
bordering
a
creek
they
had
to
try
to
locate
a
half
dozen
men
whose
helmets
and
garments
had
been
camouflaged
hide
and
seek
when
we
were
kids
was
never
half
as
thrilling
as
this
said
nancy
as
she
and
mabel
started
off
on
the
search
next
morning
nancy
mabel
and
ida
hall
were
among
the
dozen
nurses
instructed
to
camouflage
themselves
and
hide
in
the
woods
for
the
others
to
locate
nancy
had
dabbled
at
painting
in
school
and
did
a
fairly
good
imitation
of
bay
leaves
across
mabel
s
face
and
coveralls
then
before
their
small
mirror
she
touched
up
her
own
countenance
to
look
like
woods
shadows
a
net
was
secured
over
her
helmet
and
in
it
she
twisted
pieces
of
jasmine
vines
and
bay
leaves
leaving
some
of
the
vines
to
trail
down
across
her
face
they
were
given
ten
minutes
to
hide
before
the
others
of
their
unit
were
sent
in
search
of
them
nancy
found
a
spot
of
dense
growth
not
far
from
the
highway
where
a
scuppernong
vine
trailed
over
some
low
bushes
and
a
jasmine
crowned
an
old
stump
with
yellow
blossoms
she
stretched
flat
under
the
scuppernong
and
stuck
her
head
among
the
yellow
blossoms
certainly
she
could
not
have
found
a
more
fragrant
hiding
place
she
heard
the
shot
fired
for
the
search
to
begin
then
came
faint
sounds
of
the
cautious
searchers
in
spite
of
orders
whoops
and
little
screeches
escaped
the
nurses
when
anyone
was
discovered
several
passed
close
enough
for
nancy
to
touch
them
but
still
she
wasn
t
noticed
like
an
ostrich
sticking
his
head
in
the
sand
nancy
closed
her
eyes
at
each
approach
feeling
somehow
that
she
was
better
hidden
that
way
someone
was
coming
near
almost
at
a
run
when
the
shot
was
fired
to
end
the
race
nancy
was
thrilled
to
know
she
was
among
those
who
had
missed
being
found
she
was
about
to
crawl
out
of
her
hiding
place
when
she
saw
that
the
approaching
girl
was
tini
hoffman
tini
seemed
to
have
no
interest
in
the
search
however
but
was
intent
on
reaching
the
highway
while
nancy
had
crouched
under
the
bushes
she
had
heard
several
cars
go
by
cautiously
she
lifted
her
head
as
tini
passed
and
saw
some
letters
sticking
from
her
coverall
pocket
suspicion
stirred
no
doubt
tini
was
intent
on
mailing
those
letters
she
had
written
in
the
swamp
describing
their
activities
instantly
nancy
had
a
hunch
that
she
meant
to
stop
some
passing
car
and
get
the
driver
to
put
her
letters
into
the
nearest
post
office
but
she
couldn
t
run
out
there
and
accuse
her
of
such
an
intention
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
watch
her
she
saw
tini
running
and
in
the
distance
a
farmer
s
truck
coming
down
the
hill
nancy
crawled
from
her
hiding
place
and
hurried
from
tree
to
bush
on
tini
s
trail
the
car
was
quite
close
now
and
tini
jumped
a
ditch
and
ran
to
the
pavement
so
intent
was
she
on
attracting
the
driver
s
attention
she
was
completely
unaware
of
nancy
s
approach
tini
waved
her
letters
and
the
driver
slowed
when
he
stopped
she
called
out
will
you
drop
these
letters
at
the
nearest
post
office
for
me
sure
lady
agreed
the
farmer
at
the
wheel
glad
to
comodate
you
with
a
leap
across
the
ditch
nancy
was
at
tini
s
side
she
reached
for
the
letters
as
tini
extended
them
toward
the
man
you
know
you
shouldn
t
do
that
tini
she
burst
forth
the
farmer
gaped
in
amazement
at
this
strange
creature
draped
in
leaves
and
covered
with
splotches
of
paint
how
dare
you
burst
forth
tini
i
ve
a
perfect
you
have
not
give
me
my
i
will
not
and
if
you
try
to
take
them
i
ll
report
the
whole
business
to
lieutenant
reckon
i
ll
be
moving
on
said
the
farmer
uneasily
looking
at
both
of
them
as
if
he
thought
they
had
just
escaped
from
an
asylum
he
chugged
his
motor
into
action
but
before
he
rolled
off
he
glanced
at
them
compassionately
and
said
y
all
better
be
good
now
and
go
back
to
the
sylum
so
doc
can
take
care
o
chapter
seven
letters
as
the
farmer
s
truck
rolled
away
tini
glared
at
nancy
she
stomped
her
shoes
on
the
pavement
and
burst
forth
how
dare
you
hand
me
my
letters
laughing
suddenly
nancy
handed
them
to
her
he
thought
we
had
escaped
from
the
asylum
across
the
hill
she
chuckled
you
look
like
a
lunatic
and
you
act
like
one
tini
turned
and
stalked
back
into
the
pine
thicket
nancy
took
off
her
helmet
mopped
her
hot
face
with
her
sleeve
and
followed
she
finally
overtook
tini
and
asked
why
did
you
do
that
tini
i
have
a
right
to
mail
letters
if
i
then
why
didn
t
you
send
them
through
the
regular
channels
at
the
camp
who
wants
somebody
pawing
over
your
letters
looking
at
addresses
asked
tini
i
don
t
believe
anybody
pries
into
who
our
letters
are
sent
and
what
business
is
it
of
yours
tini
stopped
suddenly
and
turned
on
nancy
any
regulations
given
to
this
unit
concern
us
all
stated
nancy
firmly
zat
so
tini
s
tone
was
biting
with
sarcasm
and
if
i
broke
the
regulations
it
would
be
your
business
to
jack
me
suddenly
nancy
s
tone
became
pleading
tini
can
t
you
see
that
all
these
rules
are
for
our
own
good
and
the
safety
of
the
boys
out
yonder
we
re
offering
our
lives
to
save
i
understand
what
we
re
going
into
the
same
as
you
nancy
dale
but
some
of
the
restrictions
are
utterly
we
ve
got
to
trust
the
judgment
of
our
superiors
about
that
they
understand
the
whole
situation
better
than
we
i
see
no
reason
why
we
can
t
tell
our
family
and
friends
what
we
ve
been
doing
i
didn
t
let
out
any
military
secrets
in
those
the
other
night
under
the
net
you
asked
me
how
to
spell
camouflage
you
were
evidently
telling
them
about
our
instructions
in
tini
s
fair
face
flushed
well
what
of
it
she
snapped
it
s
no
secret
that
our
men
use
you
shouldn
t
write
about
it
for
the
simple
reason
that
lieutenant
hauser
ordered
us
to
say
nothing
of
the
things
we
ve
been
doing
on
this
trip
those
are
orders
the
very
fact
that
you
tried
to
get
somebody
outside
to
post
your
letters
proves
you
have
a
guilty
conscience
about
the
whole
and
where
did
you
get
the
right
to
jack
me
up
about
anything
i
do
i
have
only
the
right
that
every
american
should
try
to
see
that
information
about
our
military
activities
doesn
t
get
into
the
hands
of
our
so
you
re
implying
that
my
family
and
friends
are
enemies
tini
s
eyes
were
flashing
fire
now
oh
tini
this
is
so
absurd
mourned
nancy
of
course
it
s
absurd
your
trying
to
stop
my
sending
mail
suddenly
nancy
lost
all
patience
she
stopped
short
and
by
her
very
manner
forced
tini
to
stop
you
have
no
reason
in
you
tini
she
exclaimed
now
i
ll
give
you
two
either
hand
those
letters
to
lieutenant
hauser
to
be
mailed
or
burn
so
since
when
have
i
had
to
take
orders
from
you
nancy
ignored
the
question
and
continued
you
know
perfectly
well
that
the
rest
of
us
tore
up
the
letters
we
wrote
in
the
swamp
before
we
knew
we
were
not
to
write
descriptions
of
what
we
had
been
doing
those
letters
you
have
must
have
been
written
back
there
you
ve
had
no
time
for
writing
since
we
came
on
tini
ignored
the
plain
truth
with
which
she
had
been
faced
and
started
on
toward
camp
nancy
caught
up
with
her
saying
if
you
don
t
do
one
or
the
other
you
ll
place
me
in
the
embarrassing
position
of
having
to
report
what
just
happened
to
lieutenant
so
you
re
one
of
the
spying
little
tattletales
nancy
s
brown
eyes
were
full
of
fire
now
as
she
said
tini
hoffman
this
is
no
schoolgirl
business
we
re
in
thousands
of
lives
may
sometime
be
at
stake
because
some
thoughtless
person
like
you
has
seen
no
sense
in
certain
censorship
restrictions
if
we
don
t
conform
to
those
regulations
now
it
ll
be
too
late
to
learn
how
when
we
get
over
there
i
m
taking
no
chances
tini
no
matter
what
you
or
anyone
else
may
call
with
this
statement
nancy
swung
away
from
tini
and
took
the
nearest
path
back
to
camp
before
the
tent
tops
were
in
sight
however
tini
overtook
her
all
right
she
said
in
a
peevish
tone
if
it
ll
ease
your
pain
i
ll
burn
the
dern
that
s
the
sensible
thing
they
stalked
on
under
the
sighing
pines
in
silence
nancy
felt
quite
wretched
over
the
whole
situation
not
only
at
tini
s
persistent
disregard
of
the
regulations
but
at
the
awkwardness
of
her
own
position
in
discovering
her
at
it
time
and
again
however
she
was
determined
to
see
that
tini
did
burn
the
letters
and
said
as
they
came
in
sight
of
the
cook
s
fire
you
could
burn
the
letters
there
tini
and
have
it
over
sullenly
tini
stuck
her
four
letters
into
the
flames
nancy
paused
a
moment
beside
her
to
see
that
they
really
burned
while
they
waited
a
group
of
nurses
had
come
in
with
a
camouflaged
captive
oh
there
s
tini
one
of
them
called
did
you
catch
nancy
me
catch
nancy
exclaimed
tini
with
mock
humility
it
s
nancy
who
catches
me
always
what
do
you
mean
asked
ida
hall
who
was
in
the
group
she
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
sensing
that
something
was
very
wrong
between
them
nancy
s
much
too
good
for
me
to
catch
her
at
anything
continued
tini
unmindful
of
how
her
sarcasm
might
be
taken
when
she
stalked
off
alone
nancy
spoke
to
ida
wearily
i
was
still
hiding
when
the
gun
was
then
you
and
janice
williams
were
the
only
two
who
weren
t
caught
lieutenant
hauser
told
her
a
few
minutes
later
you
ll
have
the
honor
of
presiding
at
supper
and
serving
the
ice
cream
and
this
brought
exclamations
of
delight
which
only
subsided
when
lieutenant
hauser
lifted
her
hand
for
silence
but
i
have
something
that
i
think
will
be
even
more
welcome
she
said
hope
it
s
mail
from
home
said
nancy
during
the
past
week
she
had
longed
for
that
letter
her
mother
had
been
writing
on
the
night
she
heard
about
tommy
exactly
what
it
is
said
miss
hauser
as
the
mail
was
dug
from
the
big
mail
pouch
and
handed
to
the
nurses
happy
exclamations
went
up
one
by
one
the
girls
went
to
their
own
quarters
to
enjoy
their
letters
in
the
privacy
of
their
cots
nancy
kicked
off
her
muddy
shoes
and
discarded
her
dirty
painted
coveralls
and
sat
under
her
mosquito
net
she
ripped
open
her
mother
s
oldest
letter
she
couldn
t
keep
back
the
tears
as
she
read
the
brave
words
written
while
her
own
heart
must
have
been
so
heavy
we
must
not
let
ourselves
think
for
a
moment
that
our
tommy
is
dead
her
mother
wrote
if
he
is
a
prisoner
of
the
japs
he
will
need
all
the
prayers
and
helpful
thoughts
we
can
send
him
only
last
week
at
church
philip
brinkley
who
was
shot
down
over
germany
and
made
a
prisoner
told
us
a
little
about
his
escape
but
the
thing
that
impressed
me
most
was
what
he
said
about
our
prayers
he
said
he
could
actually
feel
the
prayers
we
sent
up
for
him
at
our
meeting
you
know
that
s
when
we
especially
hold
thoughts
for
those
who
have
gone
over
we
must
make
tommy
feel
our
support
and
god
s
that
way
too
tears
were
swimming
in
nancy
s
eyes
when
she
finished
the
letter
not
because
she
feared
tommy
was
really
dead
but
for
the
beautiful
bravery
of
her
mother
s
letter
she
dried
her
eyes
finally
and
picked
up
the
rest
of
her
mail
two
were
from
girl
friends
back
home
another
from
an
old
beau
then
her
heart
skipped
a
beat
when
she
saw
the
last
was
from
australia
it
wasn
t
tommy
s
writing
though
the
script
was
slightly
familiar
when
she
ripped
open
the
letter
she
saw
it
was
from
her
mother
s
friend
miss
anna
darien
in
sydney
miss
anna
and
her
mother
had
been
in
college
together
instead
of
marrying
miss
anna
had
specialized
in
philosophy
and
was
now
a
lecturer
of
international
repute
the
war
had
caught
her
in
australia
and
there
she
must
stay
for
the
duration
when
nancy
read
the
prized
letter
she
called
across
to
mabel
on
the
next
cot
say
listen
to
anna
darien
a
friend
of
ours
in
australia
saw
tommy
not
really
what
does
she
say
about
him
mabel
asked
dropping
her
own
letters
to
listen
to
nancy
ll
read
it
to
you
she
says
you
can
imagine
my
surprise
when
tommy
on
a
brief
furlough
came
to
call
on
me
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
anyone
could
mature
so
fast
in
three
years
since
i
saw
him
back
in
the
when
was
that
written
asked
mabel
nancy
glanced
at
the
date
oh
my
months
ago
took
a
long
time
to
come
they
used
to
reach
us
in
a
quite
a
while
before
your
brother
took
that
fatal
yes
but
it
s
wonderful
to
hear
from
somebody
who
s
seen
him
that
go
on
what
else
did
she
say
urged
mabel
he
asked
me
to
write
you
continued
nancy
he
knew
you
would
be
delighted
to
hear
from
someone
who
s
seen
him
over
here
you
d
really
be
proud
of
this
brother
of
yours
nancy
what
a
responsibility
it
is
to
be
a
pilot
on
a
bomber
already
his
chest
is
gay
with
decorations
but
to
me
he
s
the
same
dear
boy
he
used
to
be
when
i
visited
your
home
he
told
me
to
tell
you
not
to
worry
about
him
that
if
the
nips
get
on
his
trail
he
ll
play
the
same
trick
on
them
he
used
to
play
on
you
he
said
you
d
remember
his
childhood
prank
that
always
brought
you
to
by
this
time
all
four
nurses
in
the
tent
were
listening
and
ida
hall
asked
what
was
that
nancy
nancy
was
trembling
between
tears
and
laughter
as
she
explained
he
used
to
play
dead
and
he
trained
our
old
dog
bozo
to
do
it
too
i
used
to
tag
him
around
something
awful
and
just
to
get
even
he
d
sometimes
sprawl
on
the
ground
looking
dead
as
hector
and
bozo
would
be
near
by
his
old
legs
flopped
over
many
times
i
thought
tommy
wasn
t
breathing
i
d
shake
him
and
begin
to
cry
then
he
d
jump
up
and
grab
me
then
i
d
be
mad
sure
enough
not
a
bad
playing
dead
commented
mabel
one
of
the
fellows
we
had
in
the
hospital
back
yonder
said
he
tried
it
once
and
the
japs
just
passed
right
over
him
in
the
field
if
he
d
batted
an
eyelash
they
would
have
jabbed
one
of
their
awful
bayonets
right
through
his
illustration
couldn
t
keep
back
the
before
nancy
had
a
chance
to
read
all
her
letters
the
warning
bell
sounded
for
them
to
prepare
for
chow
she
had
only
time
for
a
face
and
hands
washing
using
her
helmet
as
a
basin
a
clean
pair
of
coveralls
was
the
extent
of
her
for
the
honored
place
beside
janice
williams
at
the
table
every
one
was
in
a
high
mood
they
all
made
merry
over
the
best
dessert
they
had
had
since
they
left
their
original
camp
through
the
hilarity
nancy
felt
an
undercurrent
of
expectancy
as
if
some
important
news
were
about
to
break
through
even
lieutenant
hauser
seemed
in
a
buoyant
mood
when
all
had
been
served
ice
cream
and
cake
janice
leaned
closer
to
nancy
and
said
i
hear
that
major
reed
came
out
on
the
truck
that
brought
the
treat
from
the
when
while
we
were
out
on
something
must
be
cooking
nancy
said
with
anticipation
nell
streets
cut
her
foot
so
didn
t
go
on
the
hunt
she
saw
the
major
and
lieutenant
hauser
having
a
long
wonder
what
s
up
nell
has
a
hunch
we
re
going
to
be
alerted
before
so
they
ve
really
been
putting
us
through
the
paces
wouldn
t
it
be
wonderful
if
they
sent
us
to
the
south
pacific
tini
hoffman
sat
next
to
janice
and
nancy
suddenly
became
aware
that
she
was
listening
to
their
conversation
i
can
fully
understand
now
why
lieutenant
hauser
insists
that
we
say
nothing
about
the
nature
of
our
training
continued
janice
it
surely
indicates
the
tropics
that
information
in
a
spy
s
hands
might
place
a
few
bombs
in
our
that
s
exactly
why
we
can
t
be
too
careful
said
nancy
she
glanced
at
tini
and
saw
that
she
actually
had
the
conscience
to
flush
under
the
memory
of
what
she
had
been
about
to
do
later
as
they
returned
to
their
tents
in
the
twilight
tini
overtook
nancy
i
m
glad
you
made
me
burn
those
letters
nancy
she
said
it
was
thoughtless
of
me
to
try
to
send
i
m
glad
you
realize
it
tini
of
course
it
s
not
easy
for
any
of
us
to
submit
to
so
many
restrictions
but
we
have
to
submit
if
we
expect
to
be
of
any
i
was
afraid
my
best
beau
would
think
i
didn
t
care
it
s
been
so
long
since
i
sent
him
a
letter
but
i
had
two
from
him
just
now
he
says
he
knows
there
ll
often
be
long
intervals
when
we
can
t
hear
from
each
other
he
s
so
understanding
murmured
tini
we
ve
got
to
think
of
the
good
of
our
unit
and
our
boys
over
yonder
tini
said
nancy
and
ourselves
but
she
wasn
t
so
certain
even
as
she
spoke
that
the
spoiled
tini
would
think
of
anything
but
her
own
wishes
next
time
she
was
tempted
to
break
the
regulations
chapter
eight
port
of
embarkation
at
breakfast
the
following
morning
lieutenant
hauser
rapped
for
attention
with
her
knife
expectant
faces
turned
quickly
toward
her
for
the
feeling
that
important
changes
were
just
ahead
had
swept
the
camp
like
a
tidal
wave
i
have
good
news
for
you
said
lieutenant
hauser
the
nurses
waited
for
no
more
their
eager
exclamations
swelled
into
cheers
that
swept
the
mess
tent
an
odd
expression
tightened
their
commanding
officer
s
face
a
moment
before
she
continued
i
see
our
enemies
are
not
the
only
ones
who
get
a
foresight
of
our
this
brought
an
alarmed
silence
but
miss
hauser
quickly
relieved
their
tension
by
smiling
as
she
said
naturally
you
ve
been
looking
forward
to
and
preparing
for
this
news
we
have
been
ordered
to
a
port
of
this
really
brought
cheers
that
rang
through
the
pine
woods
when
where
two
thoughtless
ones
asked
eagerly
those
are
sealed
orders
replied
lieutenant
hauser
we
ll
know
where
only
when
we
get
there
my
immediate
orders
are
to
tell
you
to
be
ready
to
roll
out
of
this
camp
in
an
those
who
had
not
eaten
all
their
breakfast
forgot
to
finish
as
they
hurried
off
to
pack
and
roll
up
their
tents
just
a
minute
she
called
after
the
ones
the
orders
i
have
already
given
about
writing
of
our
activities
are
more
binding
than
ever
if
you
must
write
home
merely
say
you
re
well
and
busy
there
was
one
train
wreck
not
so
long
ago
when
someone
let
it
slip
about
troop
movements
you
don
t
want
to
invite
any
such
disaster
for
the
first
time
nancy
felt
a
gulf
widening
between
herself
and
the
two
loved
ones
back
home
this
was
really
her
first
great
test
someone
had
asked
miss
hauser
a
question
nancy
had
not
heard
but
now
she
listened
while
their
first
lieutenant
said
i
think
it
might
be
safer
just
to
send
out
cards
then
you
ll
be
more
careful
not
to
say
on
them
anything
that
might
betray
our
at
noon
that
day
their
convoy
drew
up
at
the
rear
of
a
hotel
in
a
city
so
large
it
had
taken
them
a
half
hour
to
reach
its
busy
center
they
were
herded
into
a
long
room
where
a
hotel
clerk
assigned
them
their
quarters
there
were
to
be
only
two
to
a
room
once
more
so
nancy
and
mabel
managed
to
get
together
again
when
nancy
found
there
was
a
bath
with
shower
she
was
exuberant
won
t
it
be
wonderful
to
get
really
clean
all
over
once
more
she
was
peeling
off
her
coveralls
as
she
talked
we
d
better
enjoy
the
while
we
can
get
it
mabel
warned
i
figure
we
ve
got
a
long
train
journey
ahead
no
matter
whether
we
embark
on
the
atlantic
or
the
the
changes
were
swift
from
then
on
they
had
lunch
and
an
elaborate
dinner
that
evening
in
a
private
dining
room
to
nancy
s
delight
major
reed
had
lunch
with
them
before
leaving
the
dining
room
captain
lewis
who
had
arrived
with
him
gave
them
a
talk
praising
their
diligence
and
cooperation
during
the
training
period
just
before
she
finished
she
said
i
would
suggest
that
you
stay
in
your
rooms
and
rest
as
you
must
be
on
your
way
again
during
the
that
was
all
no
one
knew
what
would
be
their
method
of
transportation
or
where
their
destination
might
as
well
be
a
prisoner
complained
tini
when
she
packed
into
the
elevator
beside
nancy
i
wanted
to
get
my
hair
set
i
look
a
nancy
nudged
her
and
whispered
be
quiet
elevator
boys
have
ears
the
nurses
found
the
hall
of
the
floor
they
had
taken
over
jammed
with
baggage
brought
over
from
their
basic
training
camp
nancy
s
and
mabel
s
foot
lockers
had
already
been
placed
in
their
room
everything
seems
to
run
smooth
as
magic
said
mabel
wish
they
d
let
us
go
to
the
stores
to
get
a
few
i
imagine
we
ll
be
given
time
to
get
the
necessities
at
the
port
of
embarkation
said
nancy
i
hear
we
have
to
take
more
shots
and
physical
exams
after
we
get
there
that
takes
at
eleven
o
clock
that
night
they
marched
aboard
their
pullman
as
nancy
had
seen
those
soldiers
file
into
the
fatal
eight
cars
less
than
six
weeks
earlier
it
seemed
incredible
that
she
had
learned
so
much
in
such
a
short
time
though
nancy
was
generally
ready
for
sleep
she
felt
wide
awake
that
night
she
had
no
patience
to
wait
till
morning
to
learn
whether
they
were
traveling
east
or
west
two
nurses
had
been
assigned
to
each
lower
berth
and
one
to
the
upper
nancy
mabel
and
tini
had
one
section
so
nancy
quickly
volunteered
to
sleep
in
the
lower
with
mabel
you
re
larger
than
either
of
us
she
said
to
tini
you
ll
need
more
stretching
thanks
said
tini
accepting
the
favor
as
if
she
were
really
more
entitled
to
it
than
the
others
i
never
slept
with
i
wouldn
t
get
a
when
the
two
friends
packed
into
the
lower
nancy
whispered
i
can
hardly
wait
till
morning
to
see
whether
we
re
going
east
or
would
seem
too
good
to
be
true
to
be
sent
to
the
south
pacific
said
mabel
if
training
s
any
indication
they
ve
certainly
been
preparing
us
for
they
turned
out
the
light
and
after
a
while
mabel
raised
the
shade
a
little
she
lifted
her
head
and
peered
out
after
an
interval
she
whispered
nancy
we
really
are
heading
west
how
can
you
tell
by
the
stars
s
the
north
star
and
the
big
dipper
low
on
the
nancy
remembered
enough
from
her
girl
scout
days
to
recognize
the
northern
constellation
at
the
left
of
the
train
for
several
minutes
she
kept
lifting
her
head
to
peer
out
and
assure
herself
that
they
were
really
keeping
an
even
course
into
the
west
finally
she
settled
back
with
a
feeling
of
great
satisfaction
and
tried
to
sleep
the
pullman
was
silent
now
except
for
the
humming
of
the
wheels
beneath
them
nancy
was
almost
asleep
when
she
heard
a
peculiar
sound
overhead
she
opened
her
eyes
and
saw
through
a
crack
at
the
edge
of
the
berth
that
tini
s
light
still
burned
she
concentrated
her
attention
on
the
almost
imperceptible
sound
it
was
like
the
scratching
of
a
pen
on
paper
instantly
she
knew
tini
was
at
her
letter
writing
again
do
you
hear
something
mabel
she
asked
nudging
her
friend
mabel
lifted
a
sleepy
head
to
listen
somebody
writing
with
a
scratchy
pen
must
be
tini
never
would
have
thought
she
d
be
careful
enough
to
keep
a
maybe
it
s
a
but
miss
hauser
asked
us
only
to
send
i
m
afraid
tini
doesn
t
give
much
heed
to
what
miss
hauser
well
it
s
not
my
little
red
wagon
said
mabel
and
settled
back
on
her
pillow
her
regular
breathing
soon
indicated
that
she
slept
nancy
stayed
awake
long
after
the
pen
scratching
stopped
wondering
uneasily
about
tini
it
seemed
uncanny
how
the
girl
was
always
stuck
right
under
her
nose
did
her
superior
officers
do
it
by
deliberate
intent
before
she
finally
slept
she
made
up
her
mind
to
be
more
alert
than
ever
where
tini
was
concerned
the
following
two
days
however
were
so
filled
with
the
wonders
of
travel
that
nancy
temporarily
forgot
that
tini
could
be
such
a
thorn
in
the
flesh
she
had
never
been
west
of
the
mississippi
for
the
first
time
she
saw
the
great
western
plains
and
thrilled
when
the
mountain
ranges
beyond
loomed
on
the
horizon
she
had
never
dreamed
mere
color
could
be
so
intoxicating
until
their
long
train
crossed
the
first
canyon
it
was
like
a
fantastic
dream
yet
a
sight
never
to
be
forgotten
the
nurses
had
the
best
food
the
diner
afforded
on
their
swaying
journeys
to
and
from
the
diner
they
discovered
that
the
train
contained
many
soldiers
none
of
the
nurses
lacked
for
diverting
companionship
then
but
tini
couldn
t
be
satisfied
with
one
she
must
keep
two
or
three
buzzing
around
her
all
the
time
on
the
second
day
at
noon
nancy
and
mabel
were
in
the
diner
when
the
train
stopped
longer
than
usual
at
a
station
nancy
sitting
next
the
window
glanced
out
to
see
tini
hurrying
across
the
tracks
and
into
the
waiting
room
nancy
could
have
sworn
her
right
pocket
was
bulky
with
something
letters
no
doubt
tini
was
gone
only
a
few
minutes
before
she
returned
carrying
a
magazine
but
nancy
was
sure
her
pocket
looked
less
bulky
stubborn
as
a
mule
said
nancy
to
herself
in
disgust
she
was
determined
to
send
a
letter
to
carl
in
spite
of
the
number
of
men
available
many
of
the
nurses
spent
their
time
playing
cards
or
catching
up
on
their
magazine
and
book
reading
for
which
there
had
been
little
chance
during
their
weeks
of
training
on
the
third
day
they
at
the
city
of
embarkation
army
trucks
were
waiting
to
take
them
to
another
temporary
abode
again
it
was
a
large
hotel
where
an
entire
floor
was
assigned
to
them
cots
had
been
put
in
the
double
bedrooms
and
again
nancy
was
packed
in
with
the
she
had
had
in
the
tents
they
had
only
an
hour
before
they
were
to
report
in
room
three
for
instructions
everyone
was
eager
to
hear
about
the
next
step
and
the
room
was
full
before
the
hour
was
up
first
and
most
important
said
lieutenant
hauser
when
she
stood
before
them
once
more
you
are
to
hint
to
no
one
that
we
are
preparing
to
embark
no
nurse
is
to
leave
the
hotel
without
signing
the
register
when
she
goes
out
and
when
she
returns
i
prefer
that
you
go
shopping
or
to
the
theater
in
groups
there

relieved
that
they
would
be
allowed
to
go
out
and
do
some
shopping

unit

smiled
knowingly

chance
to
dress
up

for
a
long
time
i
want
you
to
enjoy
yourselves
as
much
as
you
can
to
the
movies
see
some
good
shows
but
always
be
careful
to
observe
strictly
the
rules
i
have
laid
the
nurses
found
however
that
the
evenings
were
about
the
only
time
they
had
for
recreation
for
there
were
numberless
things
to
be
done
in
preparation
for
departure
when
mabel
read
her
list
of
instructions
she
fell
back
on
her
bed
i
ll
never
get
my
shopping
done
she
groaned
i
ll
feel
like
a
by
the
time
we
finish
with
all
these
plague
cholera
typhus
yellow
nancy
scoffed
you
re
such
a
mabel
you
know
we
ve
already
had
lots
of
them
this
final
checkup
won
t
be
so
at
least
i
m
already
immunized
to
smallpox
and
have
had
my
typhoid
but
say
doesn
t
that
list
really
spell
the
tropics
to
you
nancy
asked
happily
wouldn
t
dad
and
mom
be
thrilled
to
know
i
m
headed
in
tommy
s
direction
with
present
restrictions
on
mail
it
ll
be
a
long
time
before
they
hear
that
mabel
reminded
her
anybody
heard
when
we
re
sailing
asked
tini
if
you
ask
me
i
don
t
want
to
know
ida
hall
told
her
too
much
responsibility
to
have
such
i
figure
it
ll
take
at
least
a
week
to
unwind
all
this
red
tape
said
mabel
they
even
want
us
to
make
our
wills
golly
moses
i
haven
t
anything
to
will
anybody
just
a
few
pieces
of
cheap
jewelry
money
s
never
stuck
to
my
fingers
long
enough
for
me
to
accumulate
you
ll
be
getting
more
pay
overseas
nancy
reminded
her
and
there
won
t
be
any
place
to
spend
it
if
we
really
get
near
the
front
however
mabel
did
make
out
a
will
of
sorts
the
two
friends
went
together
to
attend
to
this
bit
of
business
nancy
s
will
was
only
a
simple
statement
leaving
all
she
had
to
her
parents
as
they
left
the
office
where
their
signatures
had
been
witnessed
mabel
said
with
rare
seriousness
i
haven
t
any
near
kin
nancy
so
i
m
leaving
all
i
have
to
oh
mabel
she
exclaimed
her
eyes
suddenly
blinded
with
tears
not
that
i
have
anything
much
i
d
just
like
you
to
know
how
you
rate
with
nancy
squeezed
her
friend
s
arm
and
said
softly
i
ve
never
had
a
friend
like
you
close
i
mean
you
surely
find
out
about
people
when
you
live
as
close
to
them
as
we
have
these
last
makes
us
seem
we
ve
already
known
each
other
a
mabel
always
afraid
of
seriousness
and
sentiments
said
with
a
laugh
as
they
approached
their
room
i
wouldn
t
have
told
you
about
it
if
i
d
had
enough
to
make
it
worth
your
while
to
put
a
spider
in
my
chapter
nine
alert
during
those
first
busy
days
at
the
hotel
nancy
saw
little
of
tini
though
she
managed
to
get
in
always
before
eleven
and
was
at
hand
for
breakfast
she
took
most
of
her
other
meals
out
one
noon
when
nancy
mabel
and
shorty
were
on
a
shopping
expedition
they
came
across
tini
in
a
swanky
chinese
restaurant
sitting
at
a
table
with
a
woman
obviously
about
ten
years
her
senior
nancy
s
trio
in
a
high
mood
was
having
a
final
fling
they
had
carefully
checked
over
their
funds
to
be
sure
they
would
have
enough
for
a
meal
in
this
expensive
restaurant
they
were
surprised
and
not
altogether
pleased
to
find
tini
ahead
of
them
with
someone
who
would
probably
foot
her
bill
she
hasn
t
paid
a
particle
of
attention
to
what
miss
hauser
said
about
our
going
in
groups
mabel
grumbled
on
seeing
tini
has
she
ever
paid
attention
to
any
regulations
she
could
break
and
get
by
with
asked
shorty
whose
round
babyish
eyes
took
in
more
than
her
guileless
face
betrayed
nancy
gave
her
attention
to
the
menu
card
but
when
the
other
two
were
occupied
with
thoughts
of
food
she
sent
the
woman
sitting
opposite
tini
a
critical
look
the
stranger
was
a
blonde
like
tini
but
her
chic
hat
and
smart
clothes
could
not
hide
the
hard
sophistication
in
her
face
a
group
of
wacs
came
into
the
dining
room
and
nancy
saw
the
woman
s
eyes
follow
them
to
their
seats
two
army
nurses
not
of
their
unit
entered
a
moment
later
and
again
she
trailed
them
nancy
made
up
her
mind
to
ask
tini
later
about
the
woman
then
tried
to
dismiss
the
unpleasant
subject
and
enjoy
this
meal
they
had
been
anticipating
the
chop
suey
and
chinese
tea
proved
to
be
all
that
had
been
anticipated
though
they
dawdled
long
over
the
food
tini
and
her
companion
were
still
at
their
table
when
nancy
and
her
friends
rose
to
go
when
they
had
left
their
tips
and
paid
for
their
food
mabel
said
in
an
impish
tone
i
ve
gotter
pass
by
tini
s
table
on
the
way
now
mabel
what
are
you
up
to
asked
nancy
mabel
made
a
face
at
her
and
retorted
none
of
your
business
tini
s
back
had
been
to
them
but
now
she
glanced
up
and
saw
them
and
nancy
noticed
the
flustered
look
on
her
face
hiya
blondie
burst
forth
mabel
chow
was
swell
wasn
t
it
tini
nodded
at
them
coolly
at
the
door
mabel
said
oh
boy
did
she
and
her
friend
snoot
us
did
you
say
asked
nancy
in
a
sarcastic
tone
you
shouldn
t
tease
her
so
mabel
shorty
chided
tini
s
such
a
stickler
for
social
form
only
added
nancy
not
military
dumb
bloke
that
s
all
the
sense
she
has
said
mabel
in
disgust
the
girls
spent
another
hour
shopping
then
were
too
weary
for
any
more
that
day
so
returned
to
the
hotel
they
stopped
in
the
lobby
for
mabel
to
get
a
magazine
and
shorty
some
mints
too
tired
to
stand
nancy
dropped
into
one
of
the
large
chairs
in
sight
of
the
elevator
she
was
sitting
there
in
a
fog
of
weariness
when
she
saw
tini
and
her
luncheon
companion
come
in
and
ring
for
the
elevator
so
thought
nancy
you
re
either
taking
her
up
to
our
is
against
regulations
or
she
lives
in
the
hotel
herself
in
either
case
i
mean
to
find
out
where
she
nancy
had
no
time
to
let
mabel
and
shorty
know
she
was
going
up
but
made
a
dive
for
the
elevator
as
the
passengers
crammed
in
their
room
was
on
the
eighth
floor
but
to
her
relief
tini
s
friend
got
off
at
the
seventh
several
other
nurses
got
off
at
the
next
floor
with
nancy
and
tini
but
the
two
girls
found
themselves
side
by
side
as
they
approached
their
own
door
mabel
certainly
embarrassed
me
in
the
restaurant
this
noon
said
tini
in
an
ugly
mood
oh
you
know
mabel
exclaimed
nancy
she
slipped
her
key
in
the
lock
and
opened
the
door
she
s
very
common
and
loud
at
times
snapped
tini
but
with
a
heart
of
gold
stated
nancy
i
d
trust
mabel
with
my
own
hump
grunted
tini
as
she
tossed
her
cap
to
the
bed
nancy
sat
down
on
her
cot
and
slipped
her
aching
feet
into
her
bedroom
slippers
that
was
a
beautifully
dressed
woman
you
were
with
where
d
you
meet
her
asked
nancy
she
s
carl
s
aunt
webber
he
made
me
promise
to
look
her
up
if
we
got
to
the
west
he
did
does
she
live
at
this
hotel
i
noticed
she
got
off
at
the
floor
oh
no
she
s
only
visiting
to
meet
i
see
but
how
could
she
know
you
were
here
carl
wired
how
did
carl
know
suddenly
tini
flared
and
what
business
is
it
of
yours
oh
what
a
nettle
you
are
said
nancy
mabel
came
in
a
few
minutes
later
you
really
got
ahead
of
us
she
told
nancy
didn
t
know
you
were
coming
on
then
her
gaze
fell
on
tini
and
she
left
the
rest
of
her
remark
unfinished
sure
said
tini
sitting
up
suddenly
she
had
to
come
up
and
spy
on
me
and
my
why
tini
hoffman
exclaimed
ida
hall
lifting
her
head
from
the
bed
where
she
had
been
recovering
from
the
of
some
shots
how
can
you
be
so
rude
mabel
went
to
the
foot
of
tini
s
bed
and
fairly
shook
it
in
her
rage
let
me
tell
you
something
tini
hoffman
if
you
didn
t
have
a
bad
conscience
about
the
way
you
ve
broken
the
regulations
ever
since
you
got
into
this
unit
you
wouldn
t
make
such
a
mabel
s
right
ida
hall
agreed
anyone
who
can
t
stand
up
under
watching
by
all
the
rest
has
no
right
to
stay
with
us
this
is
serious
business
tini
you
can
bet
your
bottom
dollar
none
of
us
is
going
to
let
anything
crooked
get
tini
began
turning
the
pages
of
a
magazine
to
show
them
how
little
importance
she
put
on
what
they
said
a
strained
silence
filled
the
room
and
nancy
was
thankful
when
it
was
time
to
dress
for
dinner
mabel
was
a
fast
dresser
and
sat
checking
over
the
list
of
necessities
while
she
waited
for
the
others
well
i
think
i
have
everything
mentioned
on
this
list
that
i
want
to
take
she
concluded
do
you
gals
want
me
to
read
it
over
to
see
if
you
ve
forgotten
anything
good
idea
said
nancy
giving
her
auburn
curls
a
final
touch
she
had
had
her
hair
set
early
that
morning
and
wondered
when
she
would
ever
get
inside
a
hairdresser
s
again
illustration
she
s
carl
s
aunt
webber
tini
told
bathrobe
bedroom

mabel
began
for
goodness
sake
burst
forth
tini
can
t
you
see
i
m
reading
i
ve
checked
that
list
a
dozen
times
and
have
everything
on
if
them

orders
shavetail
hoffman
i
ll
desist
exclaimed
mabel
snapping
to
attention
and
giving
tini
a
mocking
salute
come
on
girls
let
s
beat
it
she
added
turning
to
ida
and
nancy
i
m
ready
for
more
though
mabel
tried
to
dissipate
the
stormy
atmosphere
by
her
light
mood
nancy
could
not
shake
off
her
depression
and
a
sense
of
foreboding
the
nurses
and
medical
officers
had
a
long
private
dining
room
at
the
rear
of
the
first
floor
nancy
noticed
that
for
a
change
everyone
seemed
to
be
on
hand
major
reed
was
in
a
high
mood
as
he
sat
with
a
group
of
his
medical
officers
nancy
s
heart
swelled
with
pride
when
she
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
of
their
personnel
here
were
medical
men
trained
in
all
branches
of
healing
and
nurses
with
various
specializations
for
assisting
them
at
the
end
of
the
meal
when
nancy
was
finishing
a
piece
of
lemon
chiffon
pie
she
glanced
up
to
note
that
the
room
had
been
cleared
of
waiters
and
sergeant
bohler
was
standing
at
the
rear
door
by
which
they
entered
then
all
eyes
were
drawn
as
if
by
some
strong
attraction
toward
major
reed
now
standing
by
his
table
i
have
the
privilege
of
informing
you
he
began
that
we
have
been
alerted
no
member
of
this
unit
will
leave
the
hotel
again
nor
may
you
use
any
telephone
send
out
any
mail
or
by
any
means
communicate
with
any
person
outside
this
room
that
we
will
embark
in
a
few
hours
everyone
must
be
packed
and
ready
to
leave
at
any
moment
when
you
come
down
to
meals
again
come
prepared
to
march
to
your
ship
if
necessary
everything
in
your
rooms
must
be
ready
for
instant
no
cheers
greeted
this
order
for
any
demonstration
might
bring
information
to
alert
spies
they
knew
were
not
far
off
sergeant
bohler
left
the
door
the
waiters
returned
to
clear
off
the
tables
and
the
nurses
and
doctors
went
straight
to
their
quarters
when
their
door
was
closed
mabel
burst
forth
exuberantly
boy
oh
boy
to
think
we
have
sailing
orders
at
last
i
ve
got
that
hollow
feeling
for
the
first
time
since
i
left
home
said
ida
hall
a
little
wistfully
it
surely
does
make
you
feel
serious
when
you
stop
to
think
what
we
may
have
to
go
through
before
we
get
back
to
these
shores
said
nancy
but
we
re
going
to
see
the
world
gals
before
we
get
back
mabel
was
the
only
one
who
had
no
close
relatives
to
leave
behind
so
her
wings
had
no
silken
cords
to
bind
them
to
home
shores
wish
they
d
waited
another
day
dern
it
exclaimed
tini
just
my
luck
though
wonder
how
long
we
ll
have
to
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
spoken
since
they
returned
to
the
room
i
imagine
major
reed
doesn
t
even
know
that
said
nancy
we
ll
just
have
to
be
ready
to
go
at
any
she
was
already
gathering
up
her
toilet
articles
from
the
dresser
as
she
spoke
i
ve
heard
they
often
go
aboard
ship
about
midnight
said
ida
we
d
better
keep
on
most
of
our
it
was
about
ten
o
clock
before
they
finished
packing
and
turned
out
the
lights
taking
off
only
their
coats
the
four
nurses
lay
down
on
top
of
their
beds
nancy
dropped
into
a
light
sleep
but
was
roused
by
an
almost
imperceptible
movement
near
the
door
well
after
midnight
though
the
room
was
in
total
darkness
she
knew
someone
was
moving
across
the
carpet
a
beam
of
light
fell
across
tini
s
empty
bed
as
the
door
was
opened
with
noiseless
caution
and
tini
herself
stepped
into
the
hall
chapter
ten
embarkation
the
moment
nancy
saw
tini
step
into
the
hall
she
knew
she
was
intent
on
making
some
secret
contact
with
someone
outside
their
unit
with
noiseless
speed
she
jumped
from
her
bed
and
followed
through
the
door
in
her
stocking
feet
in
spite
of
her
prompt
action
tini
had
vanished
by
the
time
she
reached
the
dimly
lighted
hall
she
couldn
t
have
rung
for
the
elevator
and
taken
it
in
so
short
a
time
with
swift
insight
nancy
surmised
she
was
headed
for
her
friend
on
the
seventh
floor
by
way
of
the
stairs
how
glad
she
was
she
had
made
a
point
of
asking
webber
s
room
number
at
the
desk
last
night
before
dinner
for
an
instant
nancy
stood
there
in
the
silent
hall
in
an
agony
of
indecision
what
should
she
do
she
was
tortured
between
two
tini
herself
was
a
spy
in
their
midst
or
had
innocently
but
foolhardily
let
herself
be
drawn
into
a
net
of
spies
no
matter
which
she
was
it
seemed
obvious
her
intention
was
to
let
webber
know
they
were
alerted
she
thought
of
major
reed
even
had
she
known
his
room
number
she
would
have
hesitated
to
go
to
his
room
at
this
hour
of
the
night
lieutenant
hauser
was
three
doors
down
the
hall
even
while
nancy
was
trying
to
decide
what
she
should
do
she
was
on
her
way
there
to
her
relief
she
saw
light
under
the
crack
of
miss
hauser
s
door
and
found
her
superior
officer
fully
dressed
nancy
wasted
no
time
in
preliminary
explanations
but
burst
forth
as
soon
as
she
was
inside
tini
hoffman
has
gone
webber
s
room
she
said
she
s
carl
benton
s
sister
they
ll
find
out
we
re
thanks
nancy
this
is
not
unexpected
lieutenant
hauser
said
and
acted
promptly
picking
up
the
phone
connect
me
with
major
reed
room
she
told
the
operator
a
moment
later
she
was
saying
into
the
phone
this
is
blanche
hauser
nancy
has
reported
the
expected
set
off
the
she
was
as
cool
as
a
veteran
under
fire
when
she
put
the
phone
back
in
its
cradle
we
re
not
surprised
nancy
she
said
seeing
the
girl
s
puzzled
look
we
have
the
trap
set
and
had
to
let
things
go
this
far
in
order
to
spring
nancy
s
brown
eyes
were
wide
with
wonder
as
she
asked
then
tini
a
spy
i
think
a
fool
in
the
hands
of
spies
nancy
wanted
to
cry
but
she
couldn
t
let
her
superior
officer
see
her
give
way
in
this
crisis
miss
hauser
came
to
where
nancy
had
dropped
limply
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
she
placed
her
hand
affectionately
on
her
shoulder
and
said
of
course
i
know
all
that
s
happened
before
through
major
reed
you
ve
been
wonderful
as
old
plymouth
rock
without
such
as
you
our
national
freedom
would
long
since
have
been
it
hasn
t
been
an
easy
position
nancy
admitted
we
ve
been
fully
aware
of
that
but
when
you
stop
to
realize
you
ve
probably
saved
our
convoy
from
some
horrible
disaster
what
does
any
of
that
matter
are
you
sure
it
s
not
too
late
i
hope
so
your
prompt
action
has
always
been
taken
just
in
time
you
d
better
go
back
to
your
room
now
or
your
other
roommates
may
rouse
and
be
i
m
afraid
i
ll
never
sleep
not
knowing
what
s
you
deserve
a
full
explanation
nancy
but
it
probably
won
t
come
before
sailing
i
m
not
at
liberty
to
say
more
major
reed
will
have
to
do
with
what
composure
she
could
command
nancy
went
back
to
her
room
and
crept
to
her
cot
without
rousing
the
others
she
strained
her
ears
at
the
sound
of
the
elevator
gliding
up
and
down
several
times
but
it
told
her
nothing
of
the
stark
drama
being
enacted
on
the
floor
below
never
before
had
she
felt
so
like
a
small
cog
in
a
gigantic
machine
she
must
perform
her
function
efficiently
leaving
to
a
greater
mind
the
finished
product
that
the
machine
turned
out
toward
dawn
she
finally
went
to
sleep
and
didn
t
rouse
till
her
two
friends
were
ready
for
breakfast
tini
must
be
hungry
this
morning
said
ida
hall
she
s
already
gone
but
she
left
her
coat
and
cap
mabel
observed
nancy
said
not
a
word
as
she
touched
up
her
lips
when
they
returned
to
their
room
an
hour
later
all
the
things
tini
had
left
on
her
bed
musette
bag
pistol
belt
canteen
short
coat
and
overcoat
were
gone
when
ida
hall
commented
on
this
mabel
observed
her
foot
locker
and
suitcase
too
something
s
gone
wrong
what
nancy
could
only
remain
silent
feeling
miserable
and
deceitful
even
while
she
wondered
what
had
actually
become
of
tini
when
nothing
more
was
seen
of
their
blond
roommate
by
lunchtime
mabel
confronted
miss
hauser
with
a
question
about
her
in
the
dining
room
miss
hauser
s
manner
was
as
casual
as
could
be
when
she
replied
miss
hoffman
didn
t
pass
all
the
tests
she
said
some
do
fail
to
get
over
at
the
last
minute
you
silently
the
trio
went
back
to
their
room
each
sat
on
the
side
of
her
bed
staring
into
space
after
an
interval
mabel
said
she
didn
t
fail
on
her
physicals
i
can
bet
you
that
tini
s
strong
as
a
and
just
as
stubborn
about
having
her
own
way
ida
asserted
nancy
offered
no
opinion
for
fear
she
would
betray
more
than
she
should
the
afternoon
dragged
by
nancy
brought
shorty
in
to
be
a
fourth
at
a
table
of
bridge
and
they
played
until
time
to
go
down
for
dinner
i
didn
t
think
units
were
held
over
after
alert
more
than
hours
complained
mabel
sure
wish
we
d
get
on
the
maybe
the
convoy
is
delayed
somehow
suggested
ida
nancy
wondered
if
tini
had
anything
to
do
with
the
delay
she
tried
to
forget
the
unpleasant
incident
when
they
were
in
the
dining
room
that
evening
she
suggested
you
girls
had
better
lay
in
a
good
meal
this
may
be
the
last
you
ll
get
before
you
re
too
seasick
to
they
took
her
advice
and
put
in
full
orders
a
few
in
the
crowded
dining
room
had
started
eating
and
nancy
had
taken
only
one
bite
from
the
breast
of
a
chicken
when
major
reed
came
in
his
face
told
all
who
turned
toward
him
that
the
moment
had
come
this
is
it
he
said
when
he
rapped
for
attention
you
will
file
out
immediately
to
the
room
across
the
hall
and
wait
further
orders
your
room
baggage
will
be
taken
care
now
they
understood
why
they
had
been
told
to
come
to
meals
prepared
for
marching
orders
they
filed
into
a
across
the
hall
some
did
not
even
sit
down
expecting
to
be
on
their
way
to
the
docks
at
once
however
when
an
hour
passed
and
marching
orders
had
not
yet
come
they
lit
more
cigarettes
and
hunted
seats
nancy
mabel
ida
and
shorty
huddled
together
on
a
window
seat
why
in
heck
didn
t
they
let
us
finish
our
dinner
mabel
wanted
to
know
i
ll
see
that
wasted
juicy
steak
to
my
dying
i
d
be
glad
for
even
a
drink
of
water
said
shorty
no
law
against
drinking
from
your
canteen
nancy
told
her
i
guess
this
situation
rates
as
an
the
time
dragged
into
an
eternity
everyone
wondered
what
had
happened
would
they
be
sent
back
to
their
rooms
for
another
night
s
sleep
then
at
long
last
major
reed
appeared
to
give
them
the
final
alert
nancy
glanced
at
her
watch
it
was
ten
minutes
of
twelve
they
had
been
waiting
in
this
room
over
four
hours
she
wondered
what
was
back
of
the
delay
they
were
packed
into
trucks
waiting
in
the
alley
at
the
back
of
the
hotel
then
by
dark
back
streets
their
convoy
approached
the
dock
when
the
nurses
were
lined
up
beside
a
long
warehouse
nancy
s
heart
swelled
with
pride
that
she
was
one
of
this
brave
snappy
unit
every
nurse
wore
her
dress
uniform
and
carried
her
overcoat
over
one
arm
her
musette
bag
filled
with
a
score
of
oddments
she
might
need
in
an
emergency
was
slung
over
her
shoulder
in
her
pistol
belt
was
a
kit
and
on
her
left
hip
was
a
freshly
filled
canteen
with
a
rhythmic
shush
shush
of
many
feet
they
passed
by
the
long
warehouse
and
went
across
the
dock
to
the
great
ship
rising
like
a
giant
from
the
water
to
nancy
it
seemed
incredible
that
anything
so
large
could
remain
afloat
she
had
taken
only
two
ocean
trips
in
her
life
and
those
were
on
small
steamers
between
charleston
and
new
york
in
the
good
old
days
when
no
subs
darkened
the
waters
nor
death
wings
roared
overhead
they
marched
up
the
long
gangplank
and
were
directed
to
their
quarters
everything
moved
with
oiled
smoothness
the
staterooms
had
been
turned
into
bunk
rooms
some
of
the
larger
ones
that
had
once
been
luxury
suites
had
as
many
as
sixteen
bunks
lining
the
walls
three
tiers
deep
with
a
double
bunk
to
each
tier
fortunately
nancy
mabel
ida
and
shorty
got
together
once
more
in
a
small
cabin
each
nurse
would
have
to
use
her
bunk
for
lying
dressing
and
sitting
for
all
floor
space
was
filled
with
the
hand
luggage
each
nurse
hung
her
helmet
on
the
head
of
the
bunk
close
to
her
life
preserver
and
canteen
in
her
musette
bag
nancy
had
crammed
what
she
thought
she
might
need
in
case
they
had
to
take
to
lifeboats
she
had
a
small
flashlight
some
milk
chocolate
a
change
of
undies
an
extra
pair
of
dark
glasses
cleansing
tissues
a
small
comb
two
tins
of
concentrated
food
and
many
other
odds
and
ends
an
hour
after
going
aboard
the
nurses
slipped
off
their
coats
and
caps
and
stretched
out
on
the
bunks
prepared
to
jump
up
the
moment
there
was
any
indication
of
leaving
the
dock
but
for
hours
longer
there
came
that
steady
tramp
tramp
of
soldiers
feet
as
the
transport
was
packed
to
tightness
it
was
still
dark
however
when
mabel
shook
nancy
out
of
a
sound
sleep
to
say
i
think
we
re
moving
the
other
two
girls
were
already
pulling
on
their
overcoats
to
go
on
deck
and
together
they
rushed
out
faint
streaks
of
dawn
were
in
the
sky
hawsers
had
already
been
released
and
the
giant
ship
was
being
eased
out
of
the
harbor
by
tugs
that
looked
like
midgets
in
comparison
the
first
light
of
day
was
striking
glints
from
the
water
when
they
slipped
through
the
submarine
net
at
the
mouth
of
the
harbor
the
waved
at
them
and
nancy
thought
a
little
wistfully
that
this
was
the
only
farewell
they
had
had
she
watched
the
shoreline
of
our
country
recede
not
without
a
feeling
of
sadness
dulling
her
joy
but
her
sadness
was
more
for
those
she
left
behind
than
any
fear
of
what
might
be
ahead
she
was
young
and
strong
and
eager
to
do
her
share
fully
aware
of
the
privilege
and
responsibility
of
being
part
of
this
great
task
force
her
group
huddled
close
together
had
fallen
silent
when
suddenly
the
loud
speaker
began
to
bellow
life
personnel
must
wear
life
there
was
a
general
exodus
to
individual
quarters
to
don
the
uncomfortable
rig
which
they
dubbed
their
mae
not
until
their
journey
ended
weeks
hence
could
they
be
separated
from
them
again
nancy
couldn
t
sit
still
after
she
was
safely
girded
in
her
life
jacket
she
kept
popping
her
head
up
to
the
porthole
to
see
what
was
happening
outside
one
of
the
others
filled
the
spot
every
time
she
vacated
it
they
had
orders
to
line
up
for
breakfast
at
seven
the
nurses
were
scheduled
to
eat
first
it
was
an
hour
however
before
they
had
been
served
and
could
finish
eating
when
they
reached
the
deck
again
nancy
burst
forth
look
girls
this
is
the
real
thing
they
joined
her
at
the
rail
to
see
that
their
transport
was
now
one
of
a
great
convoy
of
vessels
of
all
sorts
moving
steadily
into
the
southwest
isn
t
it
said
shorty
i
can
hardly
believe
we
re
really
on
our
way
at
last
said
nancy
happily
chapter
eleven
at
sea
that
journey
across
the
pacific
was
a
experience
though
the
intensive
training
of
the
last
busy
weeks
was
over
there
was
still
plenty
of
routine
in
their
lives
abandon
ship
drills
were
part
of
every
day
s
program
they
never
knew
when
they
were
coming
nor
whether
this
time
it
was
the
real
thing
every
nurse
swathed
in
her
mae
west
must
be
standing
at
attention
by
the
lifeboat
assigned
her
when
the
colonel
passed
for
inspection
nor
did
his
inspection
stop
there
but
their
quarters
must
always
be
tidied
so
as
to
bear
the
scrutiny
of
those
piercing
gray
eyes
the
soldiers
laughed
at
the
women
when
they
appeared
with
the
most
unexpected
items
to
be
taken
along
just
in
case
this
life
drill
was
the
real
thing
ida
hall
invariably
came
out
wearing
dark
glasses
while
mabel
always
brought
a
rubber
bathing
cap
i
ve
got
to
protect
my
permanent
from
the
salt
water
she
explained
when
a
young
sergeant
asked
if
she
was
going
swimming
i
figure
i
won
t
get
another
wave
any
time
nancy
had
a
horror
of
being
adrift
without
lights
and
water
so
always
had
her
flashlight
and
a
canteen
if
i
forget
everything
else
i
hope
i
won
t
leave
my
knife
behind
said
janice
i
may
need
it
to
slay
sharks
or
cut
up
fish
to
though
they
got
what
fun
they
could
from
this
serious
business
it
gave
nancy
a
feeling
of
safety
to
know
that
everything
had
been
so
carefully
planned
for
their
welfare
she
couldn
t
help
wondering
at
times
however
if
tini
s
wilfulness
had
really
supplied
the
enemy
with
information
they
sought
about
the
convoy
she
had
caught
only
occasional
glimpses
of
major
reed
but
at
no
time
was
there
opportunity
to
speak
with
him
privately
so
her
curiosity
about
the
whole
matter
had
to
be
stilled
every
time
she
looked
across
at
the
great
flotilla
of
ships
to
port
and
starboard
fore
and
aft
her
sense
of
security
grew
stronger
she
was
never
weary
of
watching
the
sea
and
those
other
ships
in
spite
of
their
drills
and
regulations
they
had
much
real
leisure
which
was
most
welcome
after
so
many
weeks
of
rigorous
training
most
of
the
small
discomforts
of
the
crowded
transport
could
be
endured
but
nancy
did
feel
the
pinch
of
their
limited
water
supply
with
so
much
water
all
about
them
it
seemed
strange
to
be
rationed
on
water
but
on
such
a
packed
ship
the
water
supply
was
a
real
problem
they
had
to
line
up
for
the
bathroom
then
each
nurse
was
allowed
only
a
basin
full
of
water
for
bathing
and
clothes
washing
the
girls
had
to
dodge
about
their
cabins
to
avoid
the
lines
of
clothes
constantly
drying
however
most
of
them
stayed
in
their
cabins
only
for
sleeping
and
dressing
so
could
make
the
best
of
what
could
not
be
helped
for
dinner
the
first
evening
they
changed
to
their
summer
beige
suits
for
there
was
to
be
dancing
afterward
there
were
numberless
men
for
every
girl
so
none
lacked
for
partners
nancy
was
surprised
about
ten
o
clock
that
first
evening
to
glance
around
and
discover
major
reed
asking
her
for
the
next
dance
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
spoken
to
her
since
tini
had
vanished
from
their
midst
oh
you
she
exclaimed
eagerly
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
they
moved
on
to
the
floor
but
the
place
was
so
packed
it
was
like
trying
to
dance
on
a
dime
nancy
laughed
and
said
it
s
impossible
and
the
air
s
thick
enough
to
slice
he
added
why
endure
it
when
there
s
so
much
grand
fresh
air
on
deck
do
let
s
go
outside
agreed
nancy
i
ve
been
wondering
what
the
stars
are
like
out
they
escaped
to
the
deck
by
a
side
door
and
finally
worked
their
way
to
the
prow
the
on
the
ship
made
the
spangle
of
stars
a
thousand
times
more
brilliant
than
nancy
had
ever
seen
them
they
stood
at
the
rail
a
few
minutes
watching
the
brilliant
points
of
light
swim
crazily
in
a
dome
of
purple
velvet
illustration
abandon
ship
drills
were
held
every
i
can
hardly
wait
to
see
the
southern
cross
said
nancy
a
wonderful
sight
he
told
her
two
of
the
stars
point
toward
the
south
pole
as
polaris
indicates
the
you
ve
been
down
under
before
she
asked
eagerly
i
came
out
in
the
late
spring
before
pearl
harbor
a
civilian
then
i
remember
i
was
at
pago
pago
about
the
middle
of
i
ve
never
been
any
farther
than
new
york
by
steamer
nancy
confessed
i
didn
t
dare
hope
i
d
really
make
it
down
where
i
want
most
to
things
do
work
out
sometimes
he
said
with
deep
content
they
have
for
they
fell
silent
a
moment
while
they
watched
the
other
darkened
ships
moving
across
the
wide
expanse
after
an
interval
he
said
in
a
low
tone
miss
dale
this
is
the
first
opportunity
i
ve
had
to
thank
you
for
your
there
was
nothing
else
i
could
of
course
but
you
did
it
more
tactfully
and
successfully
than
many
others
would
naturally
i
ve
been
curious
to
know
what
really
happened
the
other
night
when
i
went
to
miss
hauser
about
it
s
a
long
story
that
goes
way
back
he
began
and
glanced
around
once
more
to
be
sure
no
one
else
was
in
hearing
distance
you
ve
helped
us
trap
two
of
a
ring
we
ve
been
trailing
a
long
oh
major
reed
really
their
specialty
has
been
getting
in
with
women
in
the
service
not
only
nurses
but
wacs
waves
and
even
red
cross
workers
to
worm
information
from
them
by
subtle
tricks
at
which
they
re
very
and
tini
hoffman
s
temperament
made
her
a
gold
mine
for
them
i
should
exactly
we
took
some
great
chances
letting
her
stay
as
long
as
she
did
but
it
proved
to
be
worth
it
in
the
then
you
did
spring
the
trap
miss
hauser
spoke
of
indeed
we
did
we
had
had
a
plainclothes
man
watching
tini
ever
since
we
got
to
port
but
without
you
on
the
inside
even
he
might
have
oh
breathed
nancy
just
beginning
to
realize
fully
how
important
had
been
her
position
we
had
had
an
eye
on
this
woman
who
posed
under
the
name
of
webber
before
she
serves
as
the
sister
of
any
of
the
ring
who
have
girls
coming
into
the
i
see
said
nancy
she
looked
capable
of
such
a
sister
tini
got
in
such
a
dither
to
see
webber
that
night
because
carl
said
he
was
flying
out
to
see
her
before
she
left
she
was
to
meet
him
for
lunch
at
the
chinese
restaurant
next
alert
orders
came
and
she
couldn
t
get
out
so
she
thought
she
had
to
go
to
webber
so
carl
could
understand
why
she
broke
the
then
tini
was
not
really
spy
said
nancy
in
a
tone
of
relief
she
couldn
t
bear
to
think
that
even
of
tini
foolish
when
it
comes
to
a
realization
of
the
danger
she
might
have
placed
this
convoy
did
that
have
anything
to
do
with
the
delay
in
our
leaving
i
m
afraid
it
but
you
haven
t
told
me
just
what
did
happen
down
there
in
room
we
had
placed
a
dictaphone
in
webber
s
room
while
she
was
out
and
let
tini
have
her
say
to
get
the
record
before
we
went
in
to
take
them
both
into
custody
fortunately
tini
mentioned
the
name
of
the
place
she
was
to
meet
carl
next
noon
and
it
was
a
simple
matter
for
the
fbi
to
be
there
to
pick
him
up
he
had
shaved
his
small
mustache
but
otherwise
the
description
you
first
gave
served
an
excellent
well
what
do
you
know
about
that
nancy
said
in
wonder
how
little
she
had
dreamed
when
she
went
into
the
service
that
she
would
become
involved
in
such
a
plot
i
was
so
miserable
over
the
whole
business
she
added
after
an
interval
but
tini
was
always
placed
right
under
my
nose
i
couldn
t
help
knowing
the
awful
things
she
we
placed
her
close
to
you
deliberately
we
knew
you
were
entirely
to
be
trusted
he
said
she
flushed
in
the
darkness
and
after
a
moment
murmured
thank
you
major
reed
i
ll
try
never
to
betray
that
miss
hauser
told
me
one
of
your
roommates
asked
about
miss
hoffman
after
she
had
been
gone
a
half
day
so
i
presume
you
gave
no
hint
of
what
you
knew
to
the
no
i
didn
t
tini
had
given
herself
a
bad
enough
name
there
was
no
use
making
it
you
have
a
wise
head
on
your
shoulders
her
pulse
quickened
as
he
called
her
by
her
first
name
no
tini
s
not
really
a
one
of
those
thoughtless
people
who
can
do
as
much
harm
as
a
real
spy
said
the
major
and
you
d
be
surprised
nancy
to
know
how
many
of
those
are
crippling
our
war
nancy
sighed
we
really
do
walk
a
narrow
plank
over
dangerous
waters
don
t
we
indeed
we
do
he
agreed
but
for
everyone
who
would
betray
us
there
s
millions
loyal
to
the
core
like
i
appreciate
your
telling
me
just
what
happened
naturally
i
ve
been
wondering
but
hadn
t
dared
you
have
a
right
to
know
if
anyone
does
such
service
as
you
ve
rendered
never
brings
medals
have
to
keep
too
quiet
about
these
undercover
at
least
i
m
glad
it
s
all
over
and
we
don
t
have
anyone
else
like
tini
in
our
unit
they
re
a
grand
of
are
you
telling
me
he
exclaimed
nancy
lifted
her
head
feeling
a
wonderful
sense
of
freedom
as
she
drank
in
great
gulps
of
the
clean
fresh
air
my
it
s
great
to
be
our
way
she
said
it
really
is
he
agreed
then
he
hastened
to
ask
say
nancy
have
you
seen
the
sick
bay
you
mean
there
s
a
hospital
aboard
almost
inactive
now
but
it
ll
be
jammed
on
the
return
how
do
you
find
it
i
ll
take
you
down
and
show
you
through
right
after
breakfast
tomorrow
he
suggested
oh
that
would
be
swell
nancy
went
to
sleep
that
night
with
a
feeling
of
eager
anticipation
for
the
morning
sleeping
was
a
tight
squeeze
amid
all
their
possessions
several
times
during
the
night
nancy
was
vaguely
aware
of
mabel
giving
her
a
shove
and
ordering
keep
to
your
side
gal
but
on
the
whole
she
got
the
best
sleep
she
had
had
in
three
nights
when
she
remarked
about
resting
so
well
mabel
said
yeah
i
believe
you
could
sleep
through
storms
fire
and
nancy
s
visit
to
the
sick
bay
was
really
her
first
preview
of
the
seriousness
of
overseas
life
here
were
careful
preparations
for
looking
after
those
who
were
giving
their
blood
in
battle
and
must
be
taken
home
for
recovery
the
sick
bay
was
really
a
miniature
hospital
they
ve
thought
of
everything
that
might
possibly
be
needed
to
help
our
men
explained
major
reed
to
the
nurses
for
nancy
had
asked
to
bring
her
three
roommates
along
this
operating
room
alone
seems
a
miracle
to
looks
about
like
any
other
to
me
said
nancy
it
s
so
built
that
any
jolt
or
tilting
is
overcome
before
it
reaches
the
operator
s
i
ve
heard
of
such
marvels
said
nancy
with
deep
interest
much
like
the
floating
studios
which
radio
companies
use
to
counteract
something
of
the
same
idea
said
major
reed
they
were
shown
the
laboratory
a
small
pharmacy
and
some
contagious
wards
the
bunks
were
hung
from
stanchions
there
were
dental
chairs
and
protected
sections
for
cases
in
fact
everything
was
there
to
make
a
miniature
hospital
maybe
we
ll
get
a
chance
to
work
in
one
of
these
on
the
way
back
said
shorty
this
one
will
probably
be
in
use
before
we
get
over
major
reed
told
them
among
so
many
passengers
there
ll
no
doubt
be
some
who
will
need
attention
on
the
if
you
need
help
let
us
know
said
nancy
when
they
thanked
the
young
doctor
who
had
shown
them
through
so
the
carefree
days
slipped
by
the
air
was
bracing
the
food
excellent
nancy
felt
her
skirts
grow
a
bit
tighter
at
the
waist
and
knew
she
was
gaining
weight
she
didn
t
object
for
she
was
sure
much
hard
work
and
a
rationed
diet
would
soon
reduce
her
to
the
old
measurements
there
were
games
of
all
sorts
long
walks
along
the
decks
new
acquaintances
to
broaden
life
s
horizon
and
every
night
dancing
for
those
who
liked
the
bright
lights
of
indoors
nancy
and
whoever
she
happened
to
be
with
generally
chose
the
deck
with
its
stars
and
glimpses
of
their
convoy
there
was
a
hilarious
celebration
when
they
crossed
the
equator
and
another
when
they
crossed
the
international
date
line
they
began
to
feel
then
that
they
were
truly
in
another
sort
of
life
before
reaching
port
they
had
left
the
budding
summer
of
their
own
hemisphere
for
the
approaching
winter
of
this
strange
southern
world
then
one
noon
nancy
and
mabel
stood
at
the
rail
and
saw
their
first
flying
fish
we
re
approaching
land
nancy
exclaimed
eagerly
and
re
terns
skimming
the
froth
in
our
wake
mabel
noticed
an
hour
later
planes
came
out
to
meet
them
circling
overhead
like
guardian
wings
to
watch
them
safely
into
port
and
then
at
last
their
first
glimpse
of
a
foreign
shore
then
a
few
minutes
later
the
word
went
round
identifying
the
harbor
in
which
they
would
land
it
s
sydney
they
say
mabel
cried
nancy
joyously
i
can
hardly
believe
we
ve
really
reached
chapter
twelve
a
dream
though
there
had
been
no
one
to
bid
them
farewell
there
was
plenty
of
welcome
awaiting
the
army
nurses
on
reaching
sydney
australian
red
cross
workers
greeted
the
young
women
when
they
had
marched
down
the
long
gangplanks
cars
were
ready
to
drive
them
to
the
beautiful
house
set
amid
lovely
trees
and
flowers
where
they
were
to
stay
temporarily
the
nurses
had
so
long
been
accustomed
to
the
motion
of
the
ship
that
they
now
felt
a
little
giddy
and
unsteady
on
their
feet
i
ll
surely
be
glad
to
get
my
legs
adjusted
to
earth
once
more
said
nancy
feel
as
though
i
couldn
t
walk
straight
mabel
complained
say
but
isn
t
this
a
swell
joint
she
added
glancing
around
the
lovely
room
to
which
she
and
nancy
had
been
assigned
there
was
everything
for
their
comfort
the
pretty
curtains
and
bedspreads
were
a
joy
after
the
bareness
of
their
ship
cabin
the
bath
had
a
real
tub
in
which
they
could
compensate
for
weeks
of
indifferent
bathing
they
had
left
late
spring
at
home
but
found
approaching
winter
on
their
arrival
in
the
southern
hemisphere
their
heavy
coats
were
in
order
on
all
excursions
outdoors
funny
but
i
had
the
idea
we
d
have
to
go
round
out
here
half
dressed
drinking
ices
and
waving
fans
said
mabel
tommy
prepared
me
for
this
said
nancy
a
little
wistfully
he
left
home
last
fall
and
found
spring
when
he
got
here
strange
but
he
seems
so
much
closer
now
that
i
m
gee
nancy
wouldn
t
it
be
wonderful
if
he
did
turn
up
oh
he
must
he
will
mabel
yet
sometimes
i
think
it
s
sort
of
selfish
of
me
think
he
may
be
spared
when
such
terrible
things
have
happened
to
other
i
guess
it
s
natural
for
us
all
to
have
such
these
horrible
things
can
t
happen
to
i
suppose
we
ll
have
to
get
into
the
thick
of
it
before
we
fully
realize
how
terrible
it
really
is
said
nancy
sensing
that
their
first
real
tests
were
not
far
off
that
evening
after
dinner
lieutenant
hauser
called
them
together
and
said
we
ll
have
several
days
here
in
sydney
we
don
t
know
exactly
how
long
before
we
ll
be
moved
out
to
an
evacuation
hospital
you
ve
all
earned
a
little
vacation
take
this
time
to
see
the
city
and
enjoy
yourselves
to
the
full
our
real
work
is
not
far
in
the
eyes
sparkled
while
happy
laughter
and
comments
filled
the
room
the
only
restrictions
continued
lieutenant
hauser
are
to
guard
your
tongue
and
be
back
in
your
rooms
by
eleven
at
night
the
red
cross
volunteers
have
planned
many
things
for
you
but
you
re
free
to
do
as
you
like
have
a
good
time
for
you
ll
need
pleasant
memories
when
you
get
into
the
thick
of
i
m
going
to
phone
miss
anna
darien
nancy
told
mabel
at
once
maybe
i
can
go
over
to
see
her
oh
you
mean
your
mother
s
friend
who
wrote
you
about
seeing
tommy
yes
i
can
hardly
wait
to
hear
what
she
has
to
say
about
him
don
t
you
want
to
come
with
me
sure
but
won
t
she
be
surprised
when
she
hears
your
voice
over
the
phone
she
lives
somewhere
on
the
harbor
it
will
all
be
sightseeing
just
the
same
explained
nancy
i
never
dreamed
sydney
was
such
a
huge
place
they
say
it
s
as
large
as
some
of
our
biggest
american
it
s
surely
nice
to
be
in
a
foreign
city
where
people
speak
english
said
nancy
does
make
it
seem
more
homelike
admitted
mabel
even
if
they
do
express
things
a
little
marian
albans
a
red
cross
volunteer
helped
nancy
get
in
touch
with
miss
darien
in
a
distant
section
of
the
city
miss
anna
was
as
delighted
to
hear
nancy
s
voice
as
nancy
was
to
hear
a
familiar
loved
friend
speaking
in
a
strange
land
even
slight
bonds
grow
stronger
when
mere
acquaintances
meet
in
a
strange
land
and
those
bonds
that
are
already
strong
are
drawn
much
closer
nancy
felt
almost
as
happy
as
if
she
were
going
to
see
her
own
mother
i
hope
this
phone
call
isn
t
all
my
dear
said
miss
anna
over
the
wire
we
must
have
time
for
a
visit
with
each
that
s
what
i
called
for
explained
nancy
we
have
several
days
to
do
just
as
we
please
i
want
to
come
out
there
to
see
just
fine
but
it
s
not
easy
to
get
here
my
dear
you
ll
have
to
come
early
in
the
morning
on
the
ferry
that
crosses
the
harbor
to
take
workers
from
here
over
to
the
city
there
isn
t
another
ferry
until
it
comes
to
bring
the
workers
home
our
manpower
is
very
much
rationed
then
i
ll
come
early
and
stay
late
nancy
said
with
a
laugh
when
she
put
down
the
phone
marian
albans
said
i
ll
be
glad
to
see
you
to
the
ferry
it
would
be
rather
complicated
to
give
you
directions
for
going
that
s
awfully
nice
of
you
said
nancy
gratefully
that
will
make
it
easier
and
you
can
point
out
the
sights
as
we
when
mabel
learned
she
would
have
to
spend
the
entire
day
she
decided
to
go
only
to
the
ferry
with
nancy
so
she
could
do
more
in
the
city
when
they
went
out
early
next
morning
a
stormy
wind
was
blowing
which
marian
albans
called
a
southerly
feels
as
if
it
s
right
off
the
south
pole
she
said
as
the
two
americans
and
the
australian
went
out
into
the
street
bundled
in
overcoats
and
mufflers
they
caught
a
tram
as
the
australians
called
their
street
cars
for
a
long
ride
through
the
fascinating
streets
of
the
strange
city
by
the
time
they
reached
the
quay
where
nancy
was
to
take
a
ferry
across
the
harbor
a
driving
rain
cut
off
their
view
wind
whipped
the
water
into
whitecaps
and
the
crossing
promised
to
be
rough
do
i
have
to
walk
very
far
after
i
leave
the
ferry
nancy
asked
i
ve
only
been
over
there
once
a
place
near
your
friend
s
address
but
you
take
a
tram
on
the
other
side
up
the
bluff
and
get
off
at
military
road
explained
marian
marian
was
a
very
girl
who
told
them
her
parents
had
come
out
to
australia
a
few
years
before
her
birth
she
had
a
fair
aristocratic
face
and
the
natural
bloom
in
her
cheeks
of
which
so
many
english
girls
may
well
be
proud
maybe
miss
anna
will
come
to
meet
me
said
nancy
hopefully
illustration
was
delighted
to
hear
a
familiar
i
hope
so
said
marian
for
there
s
a
walk
through
the
bush
after
you
get
off
the
tram
on
the
other
the
bush
repeated
nancy
marian
laughed
i
believe
you
d
call
it
the
they
put
nancy
aboard
the
almost
empty
ferry
and
started
back
to
the
tram
in
the
storm
it
was
some
time
before
the
ferry
moved
out
across
the
harbor
in
the
pelting
chill
rain
nancy
thought
it
was
too
bad
to
have
such
a
miserable
day
for
her
excursion
for
the
rain
cut
off
most
of
her
view
as
the
ferry
finally
moved
slowly
away
from
the
dock
this
was
the
first
time
since
she
had
left
home
that
nancy
had
really
been
alone
suddenly
she
felt
loosened
and
detached
from
all
her
recent
experiences
and
viewed
her
training
as
through
a
telescope
though
the
time
had
not
been
long
since
she
left
home
she
felt
as
different
as
if
actual
years
had
been
required
for
her
preparation
the
fact
that
her
brother
had
been
on
this
very
ferry
on
his
last
visit
to
sydney
brought
him
still
closer
to
her
he
had
constantly
been
in
the
back
of
her
mind
during
her
trip
at
sea
and
today
she
felt
more
strongly
than
ever
that
he
was
really
alive
she
thought
how
lucky
she
was
to
be
sent
into
his
field
of
operations
it
seemed
prophetic
to
her
that
somehow
somewhere
they
were
going
to
meet
again
the
ferry
staggered
through
the
gale
around
a
point
of
land
and
soon
came
into
sight
of
the
woods
on
the
other
shore
nancy
was
thrilled
to
find
miss
anna
waiting
for
her
bracing
herself
as
the
wind
whipped
at
her
raincape
her
face
was
damp
with
the
mist
as
she
caught
nancy
to
her
and
gave
her
a
hearty
kiss
how
good
to
see
a
little
bit
of
america
she
said
and
how
stunning
you
look
in
that
uniform
she
held
nancy
off
at
arm
s
length
to
inspect
her
regardless
of
the
rain
beating
down
on
them
and
nancy
felt
almost
as
happy
as
if
she
were
being
welcomed
by
her
own
mother
we
ll
be
wet
as
rats
by
the
time
we
get
up
to
the
house
said
miss
anna
but
it
ll
be
cozy
and
warm
they
caught
a
tram
promptly
and
were
soon
on
the
path
through
the
dripping
bush
it
swung
back
toward
the
water
and
presently
nancy
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
large
community
building
in
which
miss
anna
made
her
home
with
many
other
workers
of
various
sorts
the
house
stood
on
a
bluff
overlooking
the
water
what
a
heavenly
place
exclaimed
nancy
looking
around
delightedly
so
it
is
agreed
miss
anna
her
small
brown
eyes
twinkling
they
stepped
inside
the
door
and
she
threw
back
her
raincape
nancy
followed
her
upstairs
after
taking
off
her
galoshes
and
dripping
cap
and
overcoat
the
breakfast
they
sat
down
to
a
few
minutes
later
was
a
feast
indeed
to
one
who
had
eaten
camp
and
ship
fare
so
long
there
were
peaches
covered
with
thick
cream
to
start
with
scrambled
eggs
delicious
hot
muffins
and
golden
butter
such
as
nancy
had
not
seen
in
a
long
time
we
have
our
own
cows
and
chickens
here
explained
miss
anna
by
way
of
apology
for
the
excellent
items
on
which
others
were
so
closely
rationed
i
had
some
coffee
made
especially
for
you
most
everyone
out
here
you
know
drinks
and
it
is
really
good
coffee
said
nancy
gratefully
most
of
the
other
residents
of
the
house
had
hurried
off
to
catch
the
ferry
back
to
the
city
so
nancy
and
her
friend
were
not
disturbed
while
at
their
breakfast
nancy
told
of
her
training
and
her
voyage
and
answered
numerous
questions
about
mutual
friends
back
home
finally
she
burst
forth
i
can
hardly
wait
to
hear
about
he
looked
what
he
said
when
you
last
saw
he
looked
really
marvelous
in
his
uniform
but
he
was
a
little
nervous
and
i
m
afraid
his
visit
here
wasn
t
very
why
what
happened
the
very
night
he
was
here
they
caught
some
jap
subs
in
the
really
seems
i
do
remember
hearing
something
about
the
nervy
little
nips
slipping
into
sydney
and
we
had
a
box
seat
for
the
whole
performance
miss
anna
went
on
you
mean
it
was
really
near
enough
to
see
what
happened
miss
anna
nodded
her
alert
eyes
flashing
during
the
night
i
was
awakened
by
the
most
infernal
as
though
it
came
from
the
very
bowels
of
the
you
might
imagine
being
a
forerunner
of
a
volcanic
eruption
but
it
really
came
from
under
the
water
out
in
the
harbor
the
sub
s
heavens
you
must
have
been
terrified
to
be
so
that
was
only
the
beginning
then
came
our
big
guns
roaring
from
the
forts
over
on
george
s
heights
the
reverberations
shook
some
pictures
off
my
it
must
have
been
like
an
earthquake
put
in
nancy
then
for
a
half
hour
there
was
peace
and
by
that
time
it
was
almost
daylight
then
the
commotion
broke
loose
again
i
got
into
my
clothes
and
went
out
to
find
tommy
looking
from
the
hall
window
it
was
really
the
sight
of
a
lifetime
there
were
four
little
corvettes
dropping
depth
bombs
as
they
careened
around
the
harbor
in
wide
oh
boy
i
ll
bet
tommy
was
excited
nancy
exclaimed
he
kept
saying
oh
miss
anna
if
i
were
only
in
my
plane
wouldn
t
my
bombardier
like
to
drop
a
few
we
d
soon
blow
those
subs
to
but
the
corvettes
were
doing
a
good
job
every
time
they
dropped
a
depth
charge
a
huge
waterspout
burst
high
in
the
such
a
terrific
noise
i
think
i
should
have
been
than
at
a
football
we
were
too
tense
and
frightened
but
those
corvettes
did
get
that
what
happened
then
a
huge
dredge
boat
came
out
with
cranes
and
sat
over
the
spot
where
the
sub
lay
on
the
bottom
but
it
was
three
days
before
they
could
get
it
to
the
and
by
that
time
tommy
was
gone
said
nancy
wistfully
he
was
really
disappointed
not
to
be
able
to
wait
and
see
it
brought
to
the
top
but
he
had
to
go
back
on
duty
i
wrote
him
all
about
it
though
the
dredge
finally
brought
the
sub
up
vertically
and
it
was
towed
across
to
sharpe
what
an
experience
that
must
have
all
she
had
been
about
feet
long
but
the
rear
end
had
been
blown
away
what
crafty
creatures
those
japs
are
you
know
the
front
of
that
sub
looked
like
the
mandibles
of
a
beetle
it
was
equipped
with
cutting
apparatus
to
tear
through
the
harbor
gives
me
the
shivers
to
think
how
close
they
came
said
nancy
they
say
one
of
the
subs
got
caught
in
the
nets
at
the
harbor
how
many
dead
japs
were
there
asked
nancy
six
their
bodies
were
burned
according
to
japanese
custom
and
their
ashes
were
buried
with
military
they
didn
t
deserve
it
exclaimed
nancy
bitterly
miss
anna
looked
at
her
with
an
odd
expression
we
must
not
become
bitter
or
intolerant
even
toward
our
enemies
she
said
with
gentle
persuasiveness
we
would
appreciate
our
dead
being
given
honorable
burial
wouldn
t
we
oh
yes
of
course
exclaimed
nancy
thinking
at
once
of
her
brother
and
how
she
had
prayed
that
the
enemy
would
treat
him
humanely
if
he
had
fallen
into
their
hands
but
she
had
seen
too
many
pictures
of
scores
of
people
thrown
into
common
graves
to
credit
the
enemy
with
ever
treating
any
as
considerately
as
these
men
from
the
japanese
sub
had
been
treated
if
by
treating
their
prisoners
fairly
it
will
make
life
easier
for
even
a
few
of
ours
in
their
prison
camps
it
will
be
worth
the
effort
said
miss
anna
but
it
makes
me
positively
ill
when
i
think
that
tommy
may
have
fallen
into
their
hands
said
nancy
it
would
be
better
a
thousand
times
if
he
were
dead
miss
anna
told
her
with
conviction
tommy
had
nothing
to
fear
in
death
but
horrible
things
to
endure
if
he
s
a
prisoner
of
the
i
m
sure
you
re
right
nancy
said
but
i
simply
can
t
believe
he
s
can
don
t
let
wishful
thinking
keep
you
from
facing
reality
my
dear
there
re
many
things
worse
than
death
in
this
i
m
sure
of
that
but
tommy
isn
t
dead
just
know
it
suddenly
miss
anna
s
palm
stroked
nancy
s
cheek
caressingly
i
hope
you
re
right
my
dear
i
must
admit
i
too
have
a
feeling
that
tommy
is
alive
somewhere
and
needs
nancy
glanced
at
her
friend
s
strong
kindly
face
and
asked
what
makes
you
think
that
way
miss
anna
i
ve
never
lost
the
feeling
since
i
first
learned
his
plane
had
gone
down
over
enemy
territory
then
the
other
night
i
had
such
a
vivid
a
dream
suddenly
nancy
recalled
that
one
of
miss
anna
s
lectures
had
been
on
the
significance
and
meaning
of
dreams
she
added
her
own
illuminating
interpretation
to
what
the
psychologists
had
learned
on
the
subject
i
thought
i
was
moving
through
the
jungle
trying
to
locate
a
voice
that
was
calling
me
then
as
i
went
nearer
i
recognized
it
as
tommy
s
he
was
burning
with
fever
and
i
brought
him
water
from
a
spring
i
was
so
distressed
because
the
water
didn
t
quench
his
thirst
then
i
woke
suddenly
with
his
words
ringing
in
my
ears
thank
you
just
the
same
miss
i
ve
hoped
all
along
that
tommy
survived
a
forced
landing
since
that
dream
i
ve
felt
certain
that
he
is
tears
were
shining
in
nancy
s
eyes
as
she
said
you
really
are
a
comfort
miss
her
friend
went
to
a
bookcase
and
took
out
a
small
volume
of
poetry
here
are
some
verses
written
by
anna
bright
a
friend
of
mine
who
lost
her
son
in
the
last
war
instead
of
grieving
she
used
her
genius
to
give
comfort
to
those
who
had
had
similar
sorrows
listen
to
this
were
he
dead
could
i
weep
for
one
who
gladly
bore
a
cross
that
i
might
sleep
in
peace
could
i
shed
tears
for
one
who
died
for
duty
who
laid
aside
his
fears
that
i
might
see
the
beauty
of
a
brave
soul
who
went
undaunted
to
the
fray
nor
cared
though
he
be
rent
in
twain
that
is
really
the
way
most
of
them
go
said
nancy
not
only
our
tommy
but
thousands
of
not
only
our
men
but
our
women
too
in
this
war
said
miss
anna
i
only
wish
i
were
young
enough
to
do
more
you
re
a
privileged
girl
nancy
to
be
prepared
to
do
so
chapter
thirteen
tommy
s
bombardier
nancy
s
unit
went
into
action
in
northern
australia
the
trip
up
to
the
new
hospital
was
an
exciting
experience
to
these
nurses
most
of
whom
had
never
left
the
states
before
seems
queer
to
find
it
so
much
warmer
as
we
go
north
said
nancy
during
their
first
day
s
travel
by
train
i
feel
as
though
i
m
living
upside
down
or
something
remarked
mabel
when
we
re
asleep
it
s
broad
daylight
at
home
while
it
s
warm
at
home
we
re
shivering
though
it
was
late
fall
in
the
southern
hemisphere
flowers
were
still
blooming
in
great
profusion
in
gardens
and
parks
many
of
the
flowers
were
unfamiliar
but
nancy
did
recognize
the
hibiscus
bushes
the
trees
too
were
strangers
to
them
and
had
strange
names
they
saw
the
eucalyptus
for
the
first
time
another
tree
had
needles
like
the
pine
back
home
but
fewer
branches
which
made
it
less
picturesque
to
many
of
the
american
girls
this
was
like
another
world
yet
when
the
train
stopped
at
stations
along
the
way
veterans
of
the
various
campaigns
came
up
to
the
windows
of
their
carriage
to
greet
them
speaking
english
and
asking
about
america
most
of
them
had
faces
as
if
each
year
of
fighting
had
been
like
ten
of
ordinary
life
some
were
so
newly
returned
from
the
fighting
they
still
had
that
fixed
dull
look
in
their
eyes
that
was
to
become
so
familiar
to
the
nurses
later
the
look
of
men
who
had
seen
awful
things
never
to
be
forgotten
i
know
your
men
will
be
glad
to
see
you
american
sisters
said
a
veteran
of
dunkirk
at
one
station
they
learned
that
the
australian
nurses
were
always
called
the
hospital
to
which
they
were
assigned
proved
to
be
far
more
comfortable
than
they
had
anticipated
several
blocks
of
bungalows
in
a
small
town
had
been
taken
over
for
hospital
use
these
houses
reminded
nancy
of
farmhouses
in
her
own
southland
for
they
were
built
high
off
the
ground
on
stilts
so
the
air
could
circulate
under
them
like
the
american
houses
also
they
were
surrounded
by
wide
porches
again
the
nurses
were
packed
four
in
a
room
and
nancy
had
the
same
congenial
roommates
she
had
had
on
the
boat
there
was
little
chance
to
think
of
their
own
comfort
however
for
they
were
plunged
at
once
into
work
for
the
first
time
since
they
left
california
their
foot
lockers
were
brought
to
their
rooms
and
once
more
they
had
all
their
baggage
it
seemed
good
to
settle
down
and
actually
begin
the
work
for
which
they
had
trained
and
traveled
halfway
around
the
world
the
girls
had
just
started
unpacking
when
news
spread
that
a
convoy
of
patients
a
day
overdue
was
coming
in
these
were
american
boys
who
had
been
given
first
treatments
in
field
hospitals
and
had
been
flown
back
from
the
front
in
a
nancy
had
donned
her
seersucker
uniform
and
received
her
first
assignment
from
lieutenant
hauser
the
walls
had
been
torn
out
of
the
entire
lower
floor
of
several
bungalows
to
make
wards
about
feet
in
length
nancy
s
heart
went
out
in
compassion
when
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
those
long
rows
of
beds
and
the
faces
on
those
gray
with
weariness
suffering
and
dirt
her
first
job
and
that
of
many
other
nurses
was
to
get
the
men
cleaned
up
and
begin
dressing
their
wounds
the
bandages
had
not
been
touched
during
the
trying
convoy
journey
from
the
landing
field
it
s
glad
i
am
to
see
ye
said
the
first
man
to
whom
nancy
ministered
it
must
have
taken
courage
to
force
that
smile
to
his
round
irish
face
for
gangrene
had
taken
hold
of
his
leg
and
nancy
knew
it
would
have
to
be
taken
off
promptly
and
glad
i
am
to
be
here
she
told
him
cheerfully
how
s
everything
back
home
the
next
boy
wanted
to
know
oh
just
fine
we
got
here
only
ten
days
haven
t
had
a
scratch
of
mail
in
nearly
four
months
i
hear
you
all
are
having
it
pretty
tough
with
the
rationing
and
strikes
and
we
haven
t
a
thing
to
complain
of
as
to
food
nancy
retorted
we
re
still
living
like
so
re
we
agreed
the
man
whose
arm
had
been
shot
off
except
once
when
we
ran
short
of
on
an
island
without
we
ll
make
that
up
to
you
here
nancy
assured
him
and
swallowed
hard
on
the
lump
in
her
throat
she
wasn
t
going
to
let
any
of
this
get
her
down
or
she
couldn
t
go
on
looking
after
them
i
ll
see
you
get
an
extra
helping
of
dessert
this
very
say
if
you
get
a
whiff
of
apple
pie
please
label
a
hunk
for
suddenly
the
blue
eyes
above
the
shaggy
beard
flashed
you
know
it
was
a
funny
thing
while
i
was
lying
out
there
on
the
beach
when
they
blew
my
arm
into
the
sea
i
got
to
thinking
about
ma
s
apple
pies
queer
how
a
fellow
can
think
of
such
a
thing
at
a
time
like
that
like
a
dumb
bloke
i
didn
t
worry
about
the
arm
much
just
thought
now
it
would
be
just
too
bad
if
i
never
get
to
taste
one
o
ma
s
apple
pies
again
nancy
laughed
in
spite
of
her
stinging
tears
i
ll
see
that
you
get
a
whole
pie
if
i
have
to
make
it
myself
she
promised
him
illustration
how
s
everything
back
home
the
boy
and
so
she
went
down
the
line
of
beds
cheering
and
joking
with
them
while
she
looked
after
their
wounds
there
were
few
complaints
but
how
eagerly
they
welcomed
the
gentle
hands
that
came
to
minister
to
them
most
were
ready
with
brave
banter
but
some
too
ill
for
speech
turned
pleading
eyes
that
spoke
volumes
toward
nancy
nancy
s
supper
hour
was
forgotten
there
were
too
many
who
still
needed
attention
when
her
period
of
duty
was
over
she
went
back
to
her
room
feeling
utterly
spent
this
first
contact
with
those
fresh
from
the
fighting
zone
had
taken
more
out
of
her
than
she
had
anticipated
in
spite
of
the
physical
weariness
nancy
had
a
wonderful
sense
of
at
the
moment
she
felt
certain
there
was
no
greater
work
in
the
world
than
that
of
any
army
nurse
mabel
and
shorty
had
already
gone
out
on
duty
when
nancy
and
ida
hall
returned
to
their
room
nancy
was
relieved
to
see
that
mabel
had
put
her
clothes
in
order
the
two
nurses
who
had
been
off
duty
had
arranged
hanging
places
for
their
garments
mabel
had
even
put
nancy
s
pajamas
on
the
foot
of
her
bunk
and
her
bedroom
slippers
were
near
by
it
s
really
going
to
be
very
comfy
here
said
nancy
when
she
came
in
from
a
shower
at
the
end
of
the
hall
however
she
found
that
ida
hall
was
already
asleep
nancy
scarcely
remembered
getting
into
her
double
decker
before
she
also
was
asleep
that
was
the
beginning
of
a
routine
that
lasted
for
several
weeks
eight
hours
work
eight
hours
sleep
eight
hours
for
eating
bathing
washing
clothes
and
a
bit
of
recreation
even
the
southern
hemisphere
which
came
in
june
had
but
a
slight
cooling
effect
on
them
for
they
were
too
close
to
the
equator
nancy
had
been
almost
two
months
in
australia
before
she
had
her
first
letters
from
home
there
were
a
round
dozen
from
her
parents
eagerly
she
climbed
up
under
her
mosquito
bar
to
enjoy
them
there
was
always
the
possibility
that
there
might
be
news
that
tommy
was
found
so
many
of
their
friends
who
had
first
been
reported
missing
had
later
returned
the
fact
that
miss
anna
also
had
a
hunch
that
tommy
still
lived
had
boosted
nancy
s
own
belief
that
he
would
eventually
be
returned
to
them
with
her
usual
orderliness
nancy
arranged
the
home
letters
according
to
date
and
opened
the
oldest
first
each
letter
was
filled
with
bits
of
news
of
home
and
friends
and
encouraging
words
for
herself
but
she
read
on
and
on
without
finding
the
news
about
tommy
she
had
just
picked
up
a
letter
from
a
friend
when
she
heard
ida
hall
exclaim
oh
say
there
comes
more
work
nancy
crawled
down
from
her
perch
to
look
out
the
window
and
saw
a
convoy
rolling
into
the
streets
between
the
hospital
buildings
first
there
were
trucks
packed
with
the
wounded
who
were
able
to
sit
up
these
were
followed
by
red
cross
ambulances
loaded
with
the
seriously
they
ll
more
than
fill
the
long
tent
they
put
up
back
of
ward
three
nancy
predicted
she
was
right
they
filled
the
tent
to
overflowing
and
some
had
to
be
packed
into
the
already
crowded
bungalow
wards
nancy
was
now
serving
on
night
duty
orders
came
before
she
went
on
that
evening
to
report
for
duty
in
the
tent
where
the
new
patients
had
been
put
it
was
already
dark
when
she
took
her
flashlight
dimmed
with
blue
paper
and
crossed
the
street
behind
the
buildings
to
go
to
her
new
assignment
bee
tarver
the
nurse
she
was
relieving
told
her
the
men
had
all
been
bathed
fed
and
their
wounds
looked
after
night
duty
was
easier
of
course
though
nancy
sometimes
had
to
struggle
to
keep
awake
she
was
rather
relieved
to
know
there
would
be
plenty
to
do
tonight
as
bee
described
the
various
cases
number
three
there
may
have
to
have
another
hypo
he
s
very
disturbed
she
explained
some
would
have
to
have
sulpha
tablets
and
others
must
have
attention
at
regular
intervals
one
poor
chap
who
couldn
t
move
must
have
his
position
eased
occasionally
nancy
went
her
rounds
and
toward
midnight
sat
down
at
the
end
of
the
long
tent
just
inside
the
mosquito
netting
this
end
of
the
tent
was
close
to
the
bush
and
the
sounds
of
many
strange
insects
was
like
a
pulse
beat
in
the
night
once
she
heard
planes
droning
far
off
under
the
sky
occasionally
a
groan
escaped
someone
in
the
tent
their
new
tent
ward
boasted
no
floor
and
nancy
had
to
keep
on
the
alert
for
frogs
and
insects
that
got
under
the
netting
in
spite
of
all
their
precautions
she
finally
decided
the
creatures
must
come
up
from
the
earth
she
had
just
caught
a
green
frog
in
a
small
box
and
was
taking
him
to
the
door
when
there
came
a
prolonged
groan
from
cot
three
she
washed
her
hands
in
the
basin
near
the
door
and
hurried
to
the
patient
who
had
been
sleeping
ever
since
she
came
in
the
electric
wiring
had
not
even
been
finished
so
she
picked
up
a
lantern
and
hung
it
on
the
tent
post
above
the
suffering
patient
she
turned
around
and
was
moving
closer
when
the
man
on
the
bed
lifted
his
head
and
stared
at
her
with
wild
eyes
then
a
joyous
expression
broke
over
the
gaunt
face
as
he
cried
tommy
old
boy
i
knew
you
d
get
away
from
nancy
wore
her
seersucker
trousers
and
shirt
and
had
her
head
tied
in
a
kerchief
a
precaution
against
the
wind
that
blew
eternally
across
their
campsite
if
the
patient
had
fired
a
gun
at
her
however
she
could
not
have
been
more
shocked
when
he
called
her
tommy
could
he
possibly
mean
her
tommy
her
own
lost
brother
when
she
recovered
from
the
shock
she
went
nearer
the
bed
the
man
his
face
haggard
from
suffering
fell
back
to
the
pillow
in
disappointment
he
groaned
i
thought
sure
you
were
tommy
she
whispered
softly
putting
a
soothing
hand
on
his
forehead
and
brushing
back
the
hair
tommy
who
tommy
dale
of
course
never
another
pilot
like
nancy
was
so
excited
she
scarcely
knew
what
she
was
saying
as
she
asked
you
thought
i
was
tommy
i
could
have
sworn
those
were
tommy
s
eyes
but
maybe
they
did
get
him
he
made
me
jump
first
the
sick
man
rambled
on
but
the
plane
was
still
in
the
air
when
i
saw
it
and
tommy
was
in
it
she
encouraged
him
gently
fearing
his
memories
might
be
so
fragile
the
least
shock
would
shatter
them
tommy
would
stick
it
till
everybody
was
safely
he
broke
off
as
the
feverish
eyes
came
back
to
the
brown
ones
bending
over
him
your
eyes
are
enough
like
tommy
s
to
belong
to
him
but
maybe
i
m
dying
at
last
and
you
re
really
tommy
come
to
see
me
i
m
tommy
s
sister
she
said
with
bated
breath
he
could
only
stare
for
a
moment
incredulously
no
it
can
t
be
he
finally
burst
forth
things
like
that
don
t
she
pulled
her
dog
tag
from
under
her
shirt
and
held
her
flash
so
he
could
read
the
inscription
glory
be
to
the
saints
he
burst
forth
seizing
her
hand
and
pressing
it
to
his
lips
nancy
put
her
flashlight
on
the
foot
of
the
cot
for
she
was
trembling
she
pulled
a
packing
box
closer
to
the
man
and
sat
down
from
sheer
inability
to
stand
do
you
feel
able
to
tell
me
what
happened
she
asked
gosh
yes
he
said
emphatically
i
can
get
well
now
who
couldn
t
with
tommy
s
sister
for
nurse
i
know
all
about
you
he
said
his
eyes
beginning
to
have
a
more
normal
expression
tommy
read
me
all
your
oh
then
you
re
bruce
williams
his
bombardier
sure
we
were
real
buddies
tom
and
i
no
crew
ever
had
a
finer
pilot
he
never
gave
me
an
order
i
didn
t
want
to
follow
until
that
last
command
to
jump
and
leave
him
alone
to
his
do
you
think
there
s
any
chance
he
may
be
living
we
were
over
territory
if
he
survived
the
jump
there
re
nine
chances
out
of
ten
he
s
a
but
they
didn
t
make
you
a
prisoner
she
exclaimed
oh
yes
they
did
three
long
months
they
held
me
that
s
why
i
m
in
this
broke
my
leg
in
the
parachute
landing
and
it
never
healed
properly
and
we
were
all
but
starved
to
death
i
hoped
many
a
time
while
i
was
a
prisoner
that
tommy
was
dead
and
out
of
such
oh
no
don
t
say
that
exclaimed
nancy
tears
starting
to
her
eyes
i
ve
never
felt
that
tommy
was
dead
he
must
come
back
to
us
sometime
bruce
closed
his
eyes
wearily
and
turned
from
her
a
second
i
guess
you
haven
t
seen
enough
yet
nancy
the
ones
who
get
a
clean
ticket
to
the
other
side
are
the
lucky
blokes
nancy
thought
of
the
poem
she
had
copied
from
miss
anna
darien
s
book
were
he
dead
could
i
weep
for
one
who
gladly
bore
a
cross
that
i
might
sleep
in
peace
she
took
the
sunburned
hand
lying
on
the
sheet
and
stroked
it
gently
tommy
s
friend
brought
her
brother
so
much
closer
to
her
did
any
more
of
tommy
s
crew
come
through
alive
he
shook
his
head
not
that
i
know
of
two
of
us
were
picked
up
by
a
jap
boat
and
taken
to
a
prison
camp
pete
crawford
died
of
his
injuries
three
days
after
we
got
i
shouldn
t
let
you
talk
any
more
she
said
gently
you
must
sleep
i
don
t
want
to
sleep
it
s
been
so
long
since
i
talked
to
anyone
who
he
smiled
diffidently
then
apologized
that
may
sound
oh
i
do
know
i
do
it
s
next
best
thing
to
finding
tommy
having
you
here
thanks
nancy
thanks
a
fellow
gets
to
feeling
awful
sorry
for
himself
when
he
s
sick
out
here
alone
now
it
looks
as
if
i
ve
got
something
to
get
well
but
you
won
t
get
well
unless
you
obey
my
orders
and
go
to
sleep
she
said
with
playful
severity
as
she
pulled
the
sheet
up
around
his
damp
chest
and
tucked
him
in
he
caught
her
hand
again
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
before
she
turned
away
there
were
a
thousand
questions
she
wanted
to
ask
but
she
dared
not
tax
his
frail
strength
further
tonight
tomorrow
after
he
had
slept
she
would
ask
him
more
about
tommy
s
last
flight
chapter
fourteen
bruce
s
report
during
her
off
hours
next
day
nancy
went
back
to
see
bruce
she
found
him
propped
up
having
his
lunch
how
much
better
you
look
she
said
he
smiled
at
her
brightly
you
gave
me
a
new
lease
on
life
last
she
laughed
and
suddenly
he
glanced
up
from
his
bowl
of
soup
with
an
expression
of
appraisal
say
but
you
re
pretty
he
said
after
his
inspection
much
prettier
than
those
pictures
tommy
nancy
was
glad
she
had
left
her
hair
unbound
and
taken
pains
with
her
but
she
flushed
and
said
don
t
you
dare
hand
me
blarney
bruce
williams
i
m
too
tall
to
be
the
idea
i
hear
that

the
kind
they
re
hunting
for
the
new
york
shows
tommy
s
only
one
inch
taller
than

and
our
coloring
and
eyes
are
so
much
wonder
you
thought
my
eyes
were
his
last
night
everyone
says

lots
sure
people
used
to
take
us
for
twins
when
we
were
growing
it
s
the
eyes
that
are
so
much
in
those
dale
eyes
that
goes
straight
to
your
she
sat
down
on
a
packing
box
by
his
bed
and
said
i
wanted
to
ask
you
last
night
how
you
finally
got
away
from
those
i
guess
god
just
answered
my
prayers
and
sent
our
own
boys
to
manka
oh
were
you
there
when
they
took
it
that
s
where
they
kept
the
ones
who
weren
t
able
to
work
in
their
fields
i
d
been
better
off
if
i
could
have
worked
they
get
more
food
i
hear
and
have
a
better
chance
to
store
up
supplies
for
we
ve
had
some
accounts
back
home
from
those
who
escape
she
told
him
but
just
how
were
you
freed
those
japs
just
cleared
out
and
left
us
to
our
fate
when
the
firing
got
too
warm
some
of
our
own
men
were
killed
by
the
american
firing
that
s
how
i
got
the
spatter
of
shrapnel
in
my
it
must
have
been
marvelous
to
see
your
own
countrymen
coming
ashore
on
that
island
she
said
you
re
tellin
me
he
exclaimed
santa
claus
at
christmas
when
i
was
a
kid
was
never
more
welcome
than
those
khaki
uniforms
coming
in
through
the
had
you
been
on
the
same
island
all
the
time
he
nodded
as
he
finished
his
soup
and
pushed
the
bowl
to
one
side
of
the
tray
i
haven
t
a
very
clear
idea
of
the
location
he
admitted
i
never
paid
much
attention
to
the
directions
my
job
was
to
spill
those
bombs
at
the
right
place
i
didn
t
worry
about
the
he
cleared
a
place
on
the
tray
and
began
to
draw
an
imaginary
map
with
his
finger
see
it
was
something
like
this
here
s
australia
and
over
here
s
new
caledonia
where
we
took
off
and
here
re
the
islands
we
headed
wait
a
minute
said
nancy
i
ll
get
a
map
then
you
can
sketch
me
a
more
detailed
plan
of
the
area
you
operated
sure
agreed
bruce
then
a
shadow
crossed
his
face
but
what
s
the
use
we
can
t
go
out
there
and
look
for
who
knows
she
asked
stubbornly
clinging
to
her
hopes
i
may
sometime
get
to
the
islands
i
want
to
hear
every
detail
you
can
recall
about
the
of
course
i
ll
do
the
map
for
then
he
added
hastily
but
don
t
go
for
paper
sure
i
ll
get
that
later
but
right
now
i
want
you
to
tell
me
everything
you
can
remember
about
that
last
trip
with
i
could
never
forget
any
detail
of
it
did
you
know
it
was
tommy
s
last
mission
before
he
would
be
free
to
go
home
nancy
s
heart
almost
stopped
beating
for
a
moment
no
i
didn
t
he
had
written
us
he
was
almost
through
however
and
would
be
coming
home
it
s
that
last
flight
that
generally
gives
our
pilots
the
jitters
bruce
explained
and
the
last
five
or
six
are
no
i
can
well
imagine
naturally
we
had
our
bird
tuned
up
and
checked
down
to
the
last
bolt
she
took
off
singing
as
sweet
as
any
lark
as
we
flew
into
the
northwest
we
had
spilled
our
load
on
some
jap
oil
tankers
and
were
on
our
way
back
when
those
nasty
zeros
knocked
one
of
our
engines
out
of
how
about
the
crew
then
but
the
next
hail
of
fire
got
our
jack
turner
tom
kept
his
head
until
the
other
engine
began
to
sputter
for
a
while
he
tried
to
make
it
closer
to
our
own
territory
but
it
was
no
nancy
was
folding
the
hem
of
the
sheet
into
tight
little
creases
while
she
listened
tensely
then
you
had
to
jump
she
asked
bruce
nodded
again
every
man
knew
his
job
of
course
we
had
done
it
time
and
again
in
practice
i
destroyed
my
bombsight
all
our
bombs
had
already
been
spilled
but
i
saw
that
the
doors
were
tightly
closed
ready
for
the
plane
to
hit
the
what
was
the
use
of
taking
all
those
precautions
when
you
had
to
jump
anyhow
you
know
that
bombsight
nancy
is
america
s
own
prize
possession
no
bombardier
leaves
that
for
anybody
to
investigate
peter
wouldn
t
ever
let
anybody
through
the
pearly
gates
who
had
left
that
little
instrument
intact
behind
nancy
smiled
in
spite
of
her
heavy
heart
i
don
t
see
how
you
can
keep
up
your
joking
like
better
to
laugh
than
janice
who
was
on
duty
came
to
take
bruce
s
tray
away
when
she
had
gone
nancy
asked
you
didn
t
see
tommy
jump
after
you
hit
the
water
no
i
think
he
meant
to
ditch
the
plane
after
we
were
out
he
loved
that
bird
like
something
human
he
meant
to
stick
to
her
till
the
last
then
you
think
he
went
down
with
her
to
the
a
captain
with
his
ship
oh
no
if
he
landed
on
the
water
there
d
be
a
few
minutes
when
he
could
get
out
and
try
to
swim
to
one
of
the
rubber
oh
you
had
rubber
boats
sure
pete
crawford
our
radio
man
pulled
the
levers
to
release
the
life
boats
just
before
he
jumped
you
know
they
inflate
as
they
go
down
vernon
goodwin
our
top
gunner
had
filled
them
with
water
food
supplies
and
navigation
did
you
find
one
of
them
when
you
jumped
we
were
lucky
pete
and
i
came
down
close
together
and
reached
one
of
the
boats
we
might
have
made
it
somewhere
with
the
provisions
we
had
if
those
japs
hadn
t
picked
us
up
before
illustration
did
you
see
tommy
jump
nancy
asked
if
you
saw
tommy
still
in
the
air
after
you
got
into
the
boat
he
must
have
been
too
far
away
to
swim
to
any
of
the
other
boats
after
he
hit
the
i
ve
worried
a
lot
about
that
bruce
told
her
but
it
looked
to
me
as
though
the
plane
was
turned
back
in
our
direction
there
was
a
wooded
island
on
the
horizon
and
pretty
soon
our
ship
was
so
low
we
lost
sight
of
it
behind
those
an
island
exclaimed
nancy
do
you
think
tommy
might
have
swum
to
it
that
was
our
only
hope
for
tommy
and
the
others
some
jumped
after
we
did
and
might
have
come
down
nearer
that
island
pete
and
i
started
paddling
in
that
direction
but
we
d
both
been
hurt
and
the
distances
were
deceiving
my
cracked
leg
had
begun
to
swell
and
any
movement
was
agony
pete
checked
out
clean
for
a
spell
and
i
was
afraid
he
was
gone
before
we
realized
what
had
happened
the
island
was
nowhere
to
be
nancy
smoothed
out
his
sheet
and
sat
silent
after
a
moment
she
said
bruce
when
you
draw
that
map
of
the
islands
write
down
the
names
of
all
tommy
s
crew
and
the
positions
they
now
why
do
you
want
that
i
may
run
across
some
of
the
others
somewhere
maybe
someone
was
nearer
tommy
when
he
ditched
and
will
know
what
became
of
now
don
t
you
go
getting
your
hopes
up
nancy
there
s
not
a
chance
in
a
hundred
that
any
of
the
others
will
turn
you
do
what
i
ask
anyhow
persisted
nancy
when
i
get
home
i
ll
write
to
the
families
of
all
the
crew
and
tell
them
what
i
know
even
though
there
may
be
no
hope
it
s
some
comfort
to
know
the
i
suppose
that
would
give
our
relatives
some
satisfaction
bruce
admitted
i
ve
been
so
full
of
my
own
woes
since
i
got
back
i
haven
t
thought
of
the
folks
back
home
wanting
to
hear
about
the
who
in
your
condition
wouldn
t
be
preoccupied
with
his
own
woes
asked
nancy
understandingly
but
we
re
going
to
have
you
on
your
feet
again
before
too
nancy
did
all
in
her
power
to
speed
bruce
s
recovery
in
the
weeks
that
followed
she
felt
a
real
personal
pride
in
his
improvement
at
last
there
came
a
day
when
he
was
able
to
walk
to
the
recreation
room
with
only
the
aid
of
a
stick
and
her
arm
the
nurses
had
fixed
up
this
room
for
the
use
of
convalescing
patients
i
mustn
t
get
well
too
fast
bruce
said
with
a
twinkle
in
his
nice
gray
eyes
or
they
ll
be
sending
me
away
from
bruce
was
sitting
opposite
nancy
at
a
game
of
bridge
that
day
and
she
thought
how
really
handsome
he
was
now
that
he
had
shaved
off
his
beard
and
his
gaunt
cheeks
were
beginning
to
fill
out
pat
walden
the
chap
for
whom
nancy
had
finally
made
the
apple
pie
sat
opposite
mabel
nancy
had
devised
a
rack
with
nails
driven
through
wood
for
pat
to
stand
his
cards
in
while
he
played
with
his
one
hand
her
mother
had
sent
out
some
magazines
published
for
the
handicapped
in
the
states
nancy
and
pat
had
quite
an
interesting
time
exploring
the
back
issues
in
search
of
gadgets
to
help
the
the
magazines
had
gone
the
rounds
of
others
who
must
begin
life
all
over
with
various
handicaps
pat
had
a
way
of
making
jokes
about
his
trouble
and
nancy
had
played
the
game
with
him
as
he
learned
to
do
things
with
one
hand
many
of
the
boys
however
were
sullen
and
sensitive
about
their
afflictions
and
with
these
the
nurses
had
to
pretend
that
their
handicaps
didn
t
exist
though
the
wounds
in
bruce
s
side
had
been
slow
in
healing
and
he
would
always
limp
from
the
improperly
knit
leg
bone
at
least
his
body
was
whole
and
the
doctors
assured
him
he
would
be
strong
again
at
the
moment
the
number
of
cases
was
slightly
reduced
in
number
many
of
the
earlier
patients
had
been
sent
to
ports
to
be
taken
home
on
ships
that
brought
nurses
and
men
over
i
heard
a
rumor
today
said
mabel
that
we
may
be
moved
to
the
soon
asked
nancy
eagerly
don
t
know
i
just
got
a
whiff
of
a
nothing
would
thrill
me
bruce
threw
down
a
card
with
vigor
and
glanced
across
at
his
that
s
the
way
they
treat
us
pat
eager
to
leave
us
to
our
you
ll
be
moving
on
yourselves
before
too
long
nancy
assured
him
just
when
i
m
beginning
to
enjoy
life
here
said
bruce
nancy
looks
forward
to
leaving
nancy
flushed
seeing
the
other
two
at
the
table
figuratively
cock
their
ears
oh
you
ll
soon
be
able
to
get
along
without
any
nursing
nancy
assured
him
i
can
never
get
along
again
in
this
life
without
you
he
told
her
regardless
of
their
audience
say
what
s
all
this
burst
forth
mabel
a
public
proposal
in
broad
open
daylight
don
t
be
silly
exclaimed
nancy
bruce
laughed
heartily
at
nancy
s
chagrin
thanks
a
lot
mabel
for
helping
me
out
i
ve
been
trying
to
figure
out
a
good
opening
for
a
proposal
for
the
last
you
ll
surely
have
to
make
an
improvement
before
i
ll
accept
you
stated
nancy
triumphantly
trumping
bruce
s
ace
bruce
looked
from
mabel
to
pat
walden
and
said
mischievously
you
ll
both
stand
witness
that
she
s
practically
accepted
stick
to
your
card
playing
bruce
said
nancy
pertly
this
is
no
time
to
settle
down
to
marriage
we
have
a
war
to
but
it
s
not
too
early
to
begin
making
plans
for
the
peace
he
retorted
promptly
chapter
fifteen
parting
the
nurses
made
quite
a
festive
occasion
out
of
the
fourth
of
july
although
it
was
midwinter
northern
australia
was
close
enough
to
the
equator
for
the
weather
to
be
like
midsummer
at
home
nancy
as
chairman
of
the
program
committee
started
weeks
ahead
trying
to
collect
flags
and
bunting
to
decorate
the
wards
miss
anna
darien
and
the
red
cross
workers
back
in
sydney
sent
her
boxes
that
were
real
gold
mines
for
her
purpose
their
hospital
was
not
far
from
a
camp
of
negro
soldiers
from
the
states
these
colored
men
were
primarily
employed
in
pushing
convoys
through
northern
australia
nancy
knowing
how
beautifully
some
of
them
sang
suggested
that
major
reed
invite
a
group
over
to
entertain
the
wounded
on
their
american
holiday
nancy
feared
rain
might
spoil
their
program
which
was
to
be
outdoors
but
she
took
chances
on
having
the
bandstand
arranged
in
the
middle
of
the
street
within
view
of
most
of
the
buildings
though
they
had
sloshed
through
enough
rain
to
float
a
transport
the
last
weeks
the
sky
actually
cleared
a
few
hours
before
time
for
their
program
for
a
change
the
nurses
all
donned
their
white
uniforms
and
in
spite
of
the
heat
the
medical
officers
put
on
coats
and
ties
the
convalescents
still
in
pajamas
were
supplied
with
benches
around
the
bandstand
everyone
seemed
excited
at
the
prospect
of
a
little
diversion
say
but
you
look
like
an
angel
in
that
white
uniform
bruce
exclaimed
when
he
saw
nancy
he
could
walk
almost
erect
now
without
bending
to
the
pain
in
his
side
he
had
been
given
new
clothes
which
he
wore
for
the
first
time
that
day
and
nancy
thought
him
even
more
handsome
than
ever
in
his
lieutenant
s
uniform
you
re
not
yourself
she
told
him
for
the
time
do
i
look
good
enough
to
be
your
husband
now
bruce
she
began
severely
i
have
to
keep
my
mind
on
this
program
and
can
t
think
of
the
future
just
all
right
all
right
he
said
and
grinned
impishly
i
won
t
ask
you
again
today
but
i
make
no
promises
for
i
have
a
surprise
for
you
she
said
when
she
was
about
to
leave
him
on
one
of
the
seats
hope
you
ll
like
i
like
anything
you
do
he
assured
her
i
m
not
so
sure
she
retorted
remember
i
m
from
georgia
and
you
from
new
york
i
can
t
imagine
what
difference
that
would
ever
just
wait
and
the
convalescents
band
led
off
with
star
spangled
though
nancy
had
stood
at
attention
a
thousand
times
or
more
she
still
thrilled
to
the
stirring
music
and
her
heart
swelled
with
pride
that
she
was
now
an
essential
part
of
these
great
armies
intent
upon
keeping
their
own
flags
waving
over
all
the
lands
of
the
free
and
homes
of
the
brave
after
the
national
anthem
lieutenant
hauser
led
the
nurses
in
singing
the
then
the
negro
chorus
stepped
forward
to
give
them
a
program
of
spirituals
in
sonorous
harmonizing
voices
first
they
chanted
m
goin
down
de
river
o
then
their
choir
leader
sang
a
solo
with
a
group
behind
him
humming
an
accompaniment
soft
and
sweet
as
any
organ
they
finished
off
their
first
group
with
low
sweet
which
brought
such
storms
of
applause
the
spiritual
had
to
be
repeated
when
the
hospital
band
struck
up
a
march
a
group
of
nurses
stepped
out
bearing
flags
of
the
allied
nations
and
took
a
snappy
turn
around
the
flagpole
every
spectator
down
to
the
last
crippled
convalescent
sprang
to
his
feet
and
stood
at
salute
then
suddenly
sousa
s
march
blended
into
the
lilting
strains
of
as
the
gallant
music
rang
through
the
australian
bush
nancy
who
carried
the
american
flag
in
the
center
of
the
group
of
nations
suddenly
unfurled
a
small
confederate
flag
beneath
the
stars
and
stripes
bruce
williams
and
pat
walden
standing
on
the
sidelines
were
the
first
to
notice
the
stars
and
bars
and
started
cheering
the
colored
troops
caught
their
enthusiasm
and
began
to
sing
with
the
band
a
moment
later
every
spectator
was
singing
the
old
song
with
all
the
zest
possible
when
the
band
crashed
out
the
last
notes
the
marching
group
broke
up
amid
much
clapping
and
cheers
you
made
a
real
hit
with
that
nancy
said
major
reed
when
nancy
went
back
to
the
grandstand
where
he
sat
the
major
gave
a
brief
talk
on
the
cause
for
which
they
were
fighting
he
praised
the
fine
courage
of
the
men
who
had
already
paid
so
great
a
price
and
spoke
words
of
commendation
for
the
nurses
and
doctors
who
were
serving
them
so
faithfully
after
the
outdoor
program
nancy
and
miss
hauser
went
into
the
wards
with
the
negro
chorus
which
was
glad
to
sing
the
familiar
songs
over
and
over
so
that
all
might
hear
when
they
had
finished
nancy
and
miss
hauser
were
thanking
the
singers
when
nancy
said
to
sam
turner
leader
of
the
chorus
there
s
surely
something
very
familiar
about
your
face
sam
s
wide
mouth
spread
in
a
grin
reckon
so
plenty
people
seen
dis
mug
miss
i
used
to

sam
rolling

s

up
fifty
dollar
in
tips
on
de
way
he
grinned
knowingly
dey
wus
neber
quite
so
flush
comin
back
from
florida
in
de
that
s
all
a
thing
of
the
past
now

this
big
job

said
nancy
yas
m
sho
is
miss
i
se
mighty
glad
to
see
y
all
folks
from
down
home
he
pin
wid
when
the
singers
had
driven
away
nancy
s
superior
officer
turned
to
her
and
said
we
have
you
to
thank
for
a
wonderful
program
nancy
i
had
no
idea
you
could
get
up
anything
so
thanks
said
nancy
happily
it
really
went
off
more
smoothly
than
i
expected
but
i
never
could
have
done
it
without
miss
anna
darien
and
the
red
cross
back
in
sydney
they
got
me
the
colors
for
decorations
and
the
flags
of
the
different
not
the
confederate
flag
questioned
lieutenant
hauser
and
smiled
reminiscently
at
the
hurrah
it
had
created
nancy
lowered
her
eyes
i
was
a
little
nervous
as
to
how
they
might
receive
that
she
admitted
you
made
quite
a
hit
i
m
sure
i
never
felt
such
a
wave
of
enthusiasm
as
they
put
into
illustration
there
s
something
familiar
about
your
face
so
many
of
the
boys
here
at
the
hospital
are
southern
boys
nancy
explained
and
i
knew
the
negroes
would
love
but
where
did
you
get
the
flag
persisted
miss
hauser
i
brought
it
over
with
me
nancy
confessed
you
see
it
s
the
same
little
flag
that
my
dale
carried
all
through
the
civil
war
dad
gave
it
to
me
just
before
i
left
he
said
it
had
brought
through
his
campaigns
safely
and
he
thought
it
might
bring
me
good
i
suppose
there
s
still
a
lot
of
sentiment
in
the
south
about
that
old
flag
said
miss
hauser
yes
there
is
it
would
be
hard
for
anyone
else
to
understand
how
we
feel
about
the
lost
cause
not
that
we
would
change
things
as
they
are
now
but
we
have
a
lot
of
respect
and
love
for
those
old
fellows
who
fought
and
suffered
so
much
for
what
they
thought
was
right
there
were
some
marvelous
military
leaders
among
them
you
indeed
there
were
agreed
lieutenant
hauser
our
men
study
the
military
tactics
of
lee
jackson
and
the
i
didn
t
know
that
said
nancy
but
i
m
glad
to
hear
when
they
were
about
to
separate
miss
hauser
said
oh
i
almost
reed
has
asked
to
see
you
when
your
work
is
nancy
lifted
her
eyebrows
slightly
wondering
what
was
brewing
thanks
she
said
i
ll
go
she
found
major
reed
in
his
office
he
had
already
discarded
his
coat
and
tie
and
was
drinking
a
coke
i
ll
have
one
sent
in
for
you
he
said
as
he
motioned
nancy
to
a
chair
beside
his
desk
chairs
were
luxuries
and
nancy
sat
down
gratefully
for
she
suddenly
felt
very
tired
a
fresh
supply
just
came
in
from
the
states
major
reed
explained
as
he
opened
her
bottle
my
that
tastes
like
the
corner
drugstore
at
home
said
nancy
he
studied
her
a
moment
then
asked
homesick
oh
no
i
m
having
a
wonderful
his
face
relaxed
i
was
afraid
you
were
of
course
i
d
like
better
than
anything
else
to
see
mom
and
dad
and
have
a
peep
at
all
the
folks
back
home
but
i
d
want
to
be
right
here
the
next
you
wouldn
t
mind
going
even
deeper
into
it
he
asked
she
sent
him
a
speculative
glance
oh
major
reed
are
we
going
to
get
out
to
the
islands
you
guessed
for
a
moment
nancy
felt
as
uplifted
as
she
had
been
on
the
night
she
took
her
florence
nightingale
pledge
so
long
ago
major
reed
was
opening
the
door
to
the
goal
for
which
she
had
worked
so
long
you
ve
been
such
a
good
scout
nancy
and
put
on
such
a
splendid
program
today
this
was
the
only
reward
i
could
offer
you
right
tell
you
a
little
ahead
of
the
others
that
we
re
soon
going
out
into
the
pacific
i
fear
the
work
here
will
seem
like
play
compared
with
what
we
ll
meet
i
m
ready
and
eager
to
go
she
assured
him
when
do
we
leave
shortly
but
you
are
not
to
mention
it
until
it
s
officially
the
general
announcement
was
made
sooner
than
nancy
dared
evenings
later
they
had
to
be
ready
to
leave
the
following
morning
the
new
nursing
unit
was
expected
in
that
night
to
take
over
before
nancy
started
packing
she
went
to
find
bruce
williams
and
tell
him
he
was
genuinely
distressed
i
was
afraid
it
was
too
much
good
luck
having
you
here
even
this
long
he
said
but
you
won
t
be
here
much
longer
either
she
told
him
she
leaned
across
the
table
in
the
recreation
room
where
he
had
been
reading
i
ll
tell
you
something
if
you
won
t
mention
oh
jimminy
nancy
are
you
really
going
to
marry
me
don
t
be
silly
she
exclaimed
we
ve
got
a
war
to
win
first
i
was
going
to
tell
you
that
you
re
going
to
be
sent
home
with
the
next
bunch
that
goes
out
from
say
but
that
great
see
if
i
hadn
t
been
sent
out
first
i
d
be
the
one
left
seems
as
if
it
can
t
be
home
at
last
for
so
long
i
gave
up
hopes
of
ever
seeing
the
folks
as
you
call
them
down
he
caught
her
hand
and
looked
pleadingly
into
her
eyes
but
nancy
when
you
come
home
too
will
you
promise
to
think
seriously
about
what
i
ve
been
asking
you
every
day
for
the
first
time
she
took
him
seriously
and
said
i
surely
will
bruce
and
you
won
t
forget
to
pray
that
somehow
tommy
will
get
back
to
us
you
bet
i
won
t
when
she
stood
up
to
leave
he
started
to
rise
also
but
she
pressed
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
holding
him
down
firmly
for
it
was
still
difficult
for
him
to
get
up
and
down
don
t
stand
she
said
i
must
run
suddenly
she
bent
and
kissed
him
lightly
on
the
forehead
then
hurried
away
before
he
could
come
after
her
making
their
parting
harder
nancy
found
that
the
most
trying
aspect
of
her
work
was
making
friends
then
having
to
leave
them
behind
chapter
sixteen
beach
landing
the
convoy
in
which
they
moved
out
into
the
pacific
again
was
quite
different
from
that
in
which
they
had
come
across
there
were
beach
landing
boats
of
many
kinds
in
the
great
fleet
though
this
indicated
that
they
were
to
go
ashore
on
some
beach
nancy
s
unit
had
no
idea
what
island
that
would
be
to
most
it
was
a
matter
of
indifference
but
to
nancy
it
was
immensely
important
in
which
direction
their
convoy
moved
in
her
musette
bag
she
had
tucked
away
the
little
map
bruce
had
drawn
for
her
with
the
names
of
tommy
s
bomber
crew
she
would
never
give
up
hope
of
learning
more
from
some
of
them
as
to
tommy
s
fate
the
crowded
transport
on
which
they
traveled
could
not
supply
all
with
sleeping
quarters
nancy
and
mabel
were
among
the
women
who
volunteered
to
sleep
on
deck
the
first
night
the
second
night
they
took
a
turn
below
but
found
it
so
crowded
and
the
air
so
bad
they
preferred
their
bed
rolls
on
deck
bathing
was
practically
taboo
as
their
water
supply
had
to
be
conserved
for
drinking
the
second
day
out
jap
fliers
discovered
them
so
that
helmets
and
mae
wests
were
their
inseparable
companions
their
voyage
across
from
home
seemed
like
a
pleasure
cruise
by
comparison
i
ll
surely
have
more
sympathy
with
the
dirty
men
we
have
to
clean
up
hereafter
said
mabel
trying
to
reach
under
her
mae
west
to
do
a
bit
of
scratching
i
ve
been
wondering
if
i
ve
gotten
fleas
or
something
said
nancy
i
remind
myself
of
old
bozo
back
home
he
s
always
clawing
at
some
part
of
his
when
the
jap
planes
came
over
they
had
their
first
real
chance
to
discover
of
what
stuff
they
were
made
to
nancy
s
consternation
she
was
almost
paralysed
with
fear
she
glanced
at
the
few
possessions
she
had
with
her
wondering
which
she
ought
to
take
to
the
lifeboat
it
was
awful
to
see
those
busters
sending
up
great
waterspouts
where
they
fell
and
never
to
know
if
the
next
would
land
in
their
midst
what
a
relief
it
was
when
their
own
planes
went
into
action
and
the
japs
turned
tail
but
the
aggravating
zeros
came
over
again
in
the
night
decks
had
been
cleared
and
nancy
and
mabel
huddled
side
by
side
on
a
bunk
listening
to
attackers
and
defenders
roaring
overhead
nancy
had
been
in
a
florida
hurricane
once
that
made
her
feel
like
this
all
night
long
the
oncoming
gusts
of
wind
had
threatened
to
level
the
beach
cottage
she
wondered
how
she
had
ever
survived
that
night
when
almost
momentarily
she
had
expected
death
but
tonight
she
lived
the
horrible
experience
all
over
again
no
one
could
tell
as
a
plane
zoomed
low
over
their
ship
whether
it
was
a
jap
or
american
time
and
again
they
braced
themselves
for
the
explosion
they
were
certain
must
come
she
and
mabel
clutched
each
other
s
hands
till
their
fingers
ached
it
s
beginning
to
look
as
though
major
reed
has
my
courage
she
whispered
ruefully
to
mabel
i
never
before
realized
how
wicked
i
am
groaned
mabel
all
my
sins
seem
rising
up
to
slap
me
in
the
face
suddenly
nancy
laughed
hysterically
you
re
the
limit
mabel
giggled
and
their
tension
was
broken
let
s
put
on
our
helmets
and
go
out
in
the
hall
where
we
can
keep
up
with
what
s
happening
mabel
suggested
i
always
feel
better
in
a
thunderstorm
when
i
m
standing
where
i
can
see
the
lightning
they
went
out
to
the
passage
nearest
their
lifeboat
and
felt
more
comfortable
almost
immediately
after
they
stationed
themselves
there
however
the
attackers
were
driven
off
and
peace
descended
once
more
on
the
dark
flotilla
not
until
next
morning
did
they
learn
that
a
ship
some
distance
behind
them
had
been
struck
and
sent
to
the
bottom
she
was
a
tanker
and
only
about
half
her
crew
were
picked
up
by
neighboring
vessels
but
for
the
grace
of
god
that
might
have
been
us
said
nancy
sadly
when
they
were
approaching
the
end
of
their
dangerous
voyage
the
nurses
learned
some
details
of
the
situation
they
were
to
face
their
destination
was
koshu
island
half
of
which
had
already
been
taken
from
the
japs
the
prolonged
struggle
to
gain
complete
possession
of
the
area
had
caused
many
casualties
making
a
hospital
unit
imperative
there
would
be
many
more
casualties
they
knew
from
this
reinforcing
armada
of
which
they
were
a
part
to
replace
those
being
sent
out
from
the
island
by
plane
excitement
rippled
over
the
transport
when
the
troops
and
nurses
sighted
their
destination
a
fluted
outline
of
ragged
palms
silhouetted
against
a
tropical
sky
the
which
they
were
to
occupy
had
been
taken
weeks
ago
so
the
landing
would
not
be
as
dangerous
as
it
had
been
for
the
earlier
force
about
a
mile
offshore
the
flotilla
came
to
anchor
all
morning
nancy
and
her
companions
watched
the
landing
craft
of
many
types
push
in
close
against
the
beach
putting
men
and
munitions
ashore
much
of
the
infantry
had
come
all
the
way
from
australia
aboard
the
larger
landing
craft
when
these
boats
had
discharged
their
passengers
they
returned
to
the
transports
and
filled
up
again
on
one
of
these
landing
craft
for
infantry
nancy
s
unit
went
ashore
while
they
waited
their
turn
watching
the
maneuvers
over
the
wide
theater
of
action
major
reed
proffered
nancy
his
field
glasses
she
shared
them
with
mabel
who
stood
at
her
side
do
look
yonder
she
said
pointing
to
the
eastern
end
of
the
island
mabel
whistled
softly
when
she
adjusted
the
glasses
that
must
have
been
where
they
took
the
she
said
our
artillery
surely
did
riddle
that
piece
of
coconut
most
of
the
trees
had
been
topped
and
reminded
nancy
of
blackened
chimneys
she
had
seen
once
when
several
city
blocks
burned
the
open
beach
lying
between
the
jungle
and
the
sea
was
strewn
with
the
wreckage
of
a
campsite
no
nurse
had
been
allowed
to
bring
more
than
she
could
carry
in
her
own
hands
so
nancy
s
suitcase
and
musette
bag
were
packed
to
heavy
tightness
for
two
hours
they
waited
with
their
baggage
around
them
but
at
last
they
went
aboard
the
landing
craft
nancy
was
relieved
when
finally
the
boat
moved
toward
shore
to
see
that
they
were
not
headed
for
that
point
to
the
east
buzzards
still
circled
above
it
and
she
surmised
they
had
not
yet
completed
their
ghastly
task
of
cleaning
up
the
remains
of
battle
it
was
exciting
to
see
landing
ramps
go
down
on
each
side
of
the
craft
s
bow
like
stairs
descending
into
the
shallow
surf
the
nurses
watched
while
the
first
men
went
ashore
their
helmets
on
their
bodies
padded
with
their
packs
their
guns
held
high
above
the
lapping
waves
then
a
line
of
men
formed
from
the
long
ramps
to
the
sandy
beach
as
guard
while
the
women
went
ashore
nancy
mabel
and
fifty
others
took
off
their
shoes
stuffed
their
stockings
inside
tied
their
shoes
together
by
the
laces
and
hung
them
around
their
necks
they
rolled
the
legs
of
their
coveralls
high
above
their
knees
and
with
many
excited
squeals
and
giggles
hurried
down
the
ramps
and
into
the
cool
water
breaking
on
the
shore
as
soon
as
she
reached
the
beach
nancy
sat
down
to
put
on
her
shoes
for
the
sands
were
burning
hot
before
she
rose
she
paused
to
say
a
silent
prayer
of
thanksgiving
that
at
last
she
was
on
one
of
the
pacific
islands
the
goal
of
her
dreams
these
many
months
surely
looks
as
though
we
re
in
for
tropical
living
here
remarked
mabel
glancing
at
the
jungle
wall
not
far
from
the
lapping
tide
look
farther
down
the
beach
nancy
pointed
out
isn
t
that
a
marvelous
sight
as
far
as
they
could
see
along
the
beach
landing
craft
of
every
sort
were
pushing
up
to
shore
the
one
next
their
own
infantry
craft
was
a
huge
affair
and
even
while
they
looked
its
large
doors
opened
toward
land
a
tank
rumbled
forth
into
shallow
water
and
rolled
up
to
dry
land
it
was
followed
by
several
others
gosh
doesn
t
it
thrill
you
to
think
how
fast
and
efficiently
our
country
works
said
mabel
they
tell
me
it
wasn
t
till
the
fall
of
that
the
first
models
of
these
landing
ships
were
look
at
this
surely
the
japs
can
t
beat
a
country
like
ours
said
nancy
proudly
but
even
while
she
spoke
there
came
a
rumbling
of
heavy
guns
far
beyond
that
jungle
wall
mabel
had
taken
off
her
helmet
to
let
the
wind
play
through
her
red
hair
that
was
like
a
nimbus
around
her
face
in
the
sunshine
suddenly
at
the
sound
of
firing
she
slapped
the
helmet
back
on
her
head
say
but
that
doesn
t
sound
as
if
it
s
going
to
be
so
easy
to
whip
them
she
groaned
farther
out
in
the
deep
water
they
could
see
troops
still
being
transferred
from
the
great
transports
to
the
landing
craft
another
landing
boat
pushed
up
to
the
beach
close
to
where
they
stood
it
didn
t
look
to
be
longer
than
about
a
hundred
feet
when
its
ramp
was
lowered
it
disgorged
so
many
trucks
and
small
tanks
they
wondered
how
they
had
all
been
stored
inside
as
far
as
they
could
see
along
the
beach
troops
equipment
and
boxes
of
supplies
filled
almost
every
available
foot
of
space
the
earlier
invading
army
had
cleared
a
road
with
tractors
through
the
heart
of
the
jungle
the
leveled
trees
had
been
used
on
the
most
swampy
ground
to
make
corduroy
roads
but
the
hospital
unit
was
not
to
follow
the
marching
troops
into
the
interior
illustration
craft
pushed
up
to
a
small
detachment
of
men
set
up
camp
east
of
the
road
while
the
western
side
was
cleared
for
the
hospital
site
a
small
stream
meandered
through
the
grounds
to
supply
them
with
water
for
bathing
and
laundry
they
had
brought
their
own
drinking
water
against
the
possibility
of
not
finding
pure
water
a
squad
of
negroes
cleared
underbrush
from
under
the
towering
palms
cut
a
few
trees
here
and
there
and
with
almost
magic
swiftness
the
tent
hospital
went
up
those
men
took
care
of
the
long
tents
that
were
to
serve
as
hospital
wards
and
mess
hall
but
the
nurses
put
up
their
own
sleeping
quarters
the
first
night
they
had
to
sleep
on
their
bedding
rolls
on
the
beach
for
their
campsite
had
not
been
entirely
cleared
before
the
second
night
however
nancy
mabel
shorty
and
ida
were
prepared
to
sleep
in
their
own
tent
i
never
dreamed
we
could
be
so
cozily
settled
in
so
short
a
time
said
nancy
even
their
mosquito
bars
were
up
and
they
had
the
prospect
of
a
decent
night
s
sleep
for
the
previous
one
had
been
a
nightmare
only
by
covering
up
completely
could
they
be
free
of
the
torturing
pricks
of
mosquitoes
and
then
they
sweltered
at
intervals
during
the
first
hours
there
had
come
the
rumble
of
heavy
firing
in
the
distance
like
an
approaching
thunderstorm
no
doubt
those
troops
and
tanks
that
had
moved
on
beyond
the
jungle
wall
were
already
in
the
thick
of
the
fight
an
hour
before
sunset
of
their
second
day
ashore
the
thundering
reverberations
were
increased
before
dark
their
tent
hospital
not
yet
ready
for
patients
was
precipitated
into
action
ambulances
began
rolling
in
from
the
north
those
first
patients
had
to
be
stretchered
on
the
sands
of
the
beach
to
nancy
s
amazement
she
found
that
some
were
not
bloody
wounded
men
in
reply
to
her
inquiry
about
them
captain
crawford
said
they
tell
me
they
re
men
freed
when
they
took
over
a
native
some
had
evidently
been
in
line
of
the
attacking
fire
nancy
discovered
as
she
bent
over
a
chap
with
a
shredded
arm
were
you
a
prisoner
of
the
japs
she
asked
not
even
as
he
replied
nancy
realized
from
his
look
that
he
must
have
been
one
of
the
attackers
i
got
this
as
we
took
the
village
those
poor
creatures
in
that
ambulance
yonder
were
many
of
them
asked
nancy
wishing
she
could
look
after
them
a
dozen
or
so
i
suppose
more
had
been
there
but
had
passed
beyond
our
who
are
they
did
you
hear
any
of
their
names
sister
we
didn
t
stop
for
that
they
were
americans
and
that
was
enough
for
nancy
had
been
cutting
away
the
boy
s
bloody
shirt
as
she
talked
and
now
she
began
to
clean
his
wound
captain
crawford
came
to
probe
for
lead
nancy
gave
the
soldier
a
hypo
and
the
doctor
went
back
to
his
first
patient
while
it
took
effect
you
nurses
and
doctors
got
here
just
in
time
said
the
young
corporal
gratefully
then
you
were
here
before
she
asked
three
weeks
we
ve
been
driving
em
you
were
lucky
to
escape
so
glad
they
waited
till
you
got
here
he
said
beginning
to
look
drowsy
a
few
minutes
later
the
boy
was
sleeping
his
wound
dressed
and
nancy
rose
to
go
to
the
next
cot
she
sent
a
fleeting
glance
along
the
beach
and
under
the
towering
palms
where
men
with
all
manner
of
wounds
were
lying
here
was
work
enough
for
a
hundred
nurses
she
saw
there
would
be
no
sleep
for
any
of
the
fifty
who
were
here
tonight
a
doctor
near
by
was
amputating
an
arm
working
fast
while
the
daylight
lasted
mabel
worked
with
the
released
prisoners
she
was
giving
plasma
to
one
evidently
at
the
point
of
death
nancy
paused
to
give
her
a
hand
she
was
amazed
to
see
that
the
man
s
hair
was
snow
white
wonder
how
anyone
this
old
got
into
the
service
she
whispered
to
mabel
the
man
s
face
was
brown
and
creased
as
cracked
leather
only
a
loin
cloth
hung
about
his
waist
while
every
rib
could
be
counted
in
his
shriveled
body
his
limbs
were
mere
bones
making
the
joints
seem
abnormally
large
in
spite
of
all
this
they
could
see
he
had
once
been
a
powerful
tall
man
he
looks
too
dark
to
be
an
american
said
nancy
dubiously
this
sun
can
cook
anybody
s
skin
that
brown
look
his
dog
tag
s
still
on
that
gives
his
data
said
mabel
for
she
had
already
referred
to
it
to
get
his
blood
type
the
man
was
in
a
coma
there
seemed
slight
chance
they
could
bring
him
around
yet
there
was
life
still
in
his
pulse
and
they
did
everything
which
modern
science
knew
to
strengthen
that
feeble
spark
nancy
picked
up
the
tag
from
the
bony
chest
and
read
vernon
yep
i
noticed
that
when
i
looked
for
his
blood
type
said
mabel
nearest
relative
goodwin
graceville
not
only
an
american
but
a
southerner
exclaimed
nancy
protestant
religion
vernon
goodwin
she
repeated
softly
to
her
surprise
the
sick
man
s
eyelids
fluttered
and
nancy
thought
the
light
of
consciousness
welled
up
as
he
looked
at
her
a
moment
the
lips
tried
to
move
but
no
words
came
there
s
something
familiar
in
that
name
common
enough
name
back
could
he
be
one
of
tommy
s
bomber
crew
again
the
eyelids
fluttered
and
again
the
lips
tried
to
move
mabel
i
ve
got
to
know
exclaimed
nancy
i
m
going
to
run
up
to
our
tent
to
get
that
list
bruce
wrote
for
nancy
was
back
in
five
minutes
but
mabel
had
moved
to
the
next
man
her
face
was
shining
with
an
inner
light
when
she
went
up
to
her
friend
and
said
it
is
one
of
them
mabel
vernon
goodwin
tommy
s
well
of
all
things
burst
forth
mabel
it
s
a
little
world
after
but
he
may
die
poor
soul
he
has
only
a
slim
chance
i
d
say
even
to
realize
he
s
been
rescued
much
less
to
tell
you
about
the
but
mabel
we
ve
got
to
bring
him
surely
he
can
tell
us
about
tommy
why
tommy
may
even
be
among
these
as
the
idea
seized
her
nancy
hurried
off
to
search
the
faces
of
those
prisoners
she
looked
at
each
emaciated
face
with
hope
only
to
turn
away
with
a
heavy
heart
then
the
idea
came
to
her
that
tommy
s
suffering
might
have
changed
him
beyond
recognition
so
she
went
back
among
the
prisoners
this
time
examining
their
dog
tags
when
she
passed
mabel
a
second
time
her
friend
gave
her
a
sharp
look
and
said
snap
out
of
it
nancy
you
d
better
get
back
on
the
job
or
they
ll
be
jacking
you
up
for
shirking
nancy
flushed
and
came
to
herself
with
a
start
she
had
never
received
a
reprimand
of
that
sort
and
would
have
felt
disgraced
to
merit
it
in
this
first
real
testing
hour
several
times
during
the
night
however
she
returned
to
see
about
vernon
goodwin
at
last
as
she
turned
her
light
on
his
face
to
watch
his
breathing
she
thought
she
saw
a
faint
color
in
his
dry
lips
he
must
live
he
must
she
kept
saying
the
words
to
herself
if
he
died
she
might
never
know
what
had
really
become
of
tommy
vernon
seemed
her
last
hope
of
gaining
some
clue
that
might
lead
to
rescuing
him
chapter
seventeen
the
gunner
s
story
the
systematic
routine
of
nursing
in
which
nancy
and
her
fellow
workers
had
been
so
carefully
trained
had
to
be
forgotten
in
the
trying
days
that
followed
although
the
nurses
went
on
duty
at
stated
intervals
theoretically
to
work
for
eight
hours
few
ever
stopped
before
reaching
the
point
of
exhaustion
even
with
their
large
and
unit
there
were
not
half
enough
to
meet
the
need
if
the
nurses
back
home
could
fly
out
here
for
one
to
see
how
badly
we
need
help
said
nancy
they
couldn
t
get
into
the
anc
fast
don
t
you
m
going
to
tell
em
a
few
things
in
my
next
letters
home
mabel
assured
her
mabel
was
beginning
to
look
something
like
a
guinea
egg
for
the
hot
sun
and
constant
glare
had
peppered
her
fair
face
with
freckles
she
wore
her
hair
pinned
up
tightly
under
her
kerchief
as
most
of
the
others
did
wind
blew
almost
constantly
across
the
island
and
without
some
protection
hair
would
always
be
in
their
faces
nancy
had
burned
badly
on
their
last
sea
voyage
and
was
now
beginning
to
peel
there
s
one
consolation
she
remarked
to
mabel
everybody
looks
about
as
bad
as
everybody
and
who
gives
a
hang
mabel
wanted
to
know
there
re
really
more
important
things
to
think
about
it
s
what
you
can
do
and
hold
up
under
that
counts
these
it
took
some
time
for
nancy
to
condition
herself
to
that
constant
rumble
of
artillery
at
first
each
reverberation
that
shook
their
tent
poles
set
her
aquiver
she
knew
that
every
blast
only
increased
the
number
of
dead
and
wounded
life
on
koshu
was
as
complicated
as
a
circus
besides
the
continual
rumble
of
artillery
as
the
americans
pushed
north
across
the
island
there
was
the
constant
drone
of
planes
overhead
at
first
nancy
had
the
impulse
to
run
out
and
look
up
to
discover
whether
they
were
japs
or
americans
but
she
soon
learned
to
trust
their
sirens
to
give
her
warning
of
danger
she
had
her
job
to
do
if
she
was
to
keep
fit
for
it
she
must
concentrate
on
her
own
part
of
the
great
task
by
the
third
day
the
hospital
was
full
to
overflowing
nancy
and
her
quartette
offered
their
private
tent
to
give
shelter
to
more
wounded
other
nurses
followed
their
example
the
negro
camp
helpers
built
the
nurses
a
long
shelter
roofed
with
palm
fronds
some
of
the
island
natives
dubbed
fuzzy
wuzzies
because
of
their
bushy
heads
directed
the
construction
the
nurses
called
their
new
quarters
the
dormitory
though
there
was
plenty
of
fresh
air
there
was
certainly
little
privacy
who
has
time
for
privacy
these
days
nancy
wanted
to
know
their
new
quarters
proved
to
be
much
cooler
than
the
tents
mosquito
bars
were
hung
from
the
rafters
by
the
time
the
nurses
were
able
to
crawl
under
their
nets
they
were
so
exhausted
they
missed
none
of
the
luxuries
of
normal
life
to
be
able
to
stretch
out
and
sleep
awhile
on
a
canvas
cot
seemed
luxury
enough
the
little
area
which
each
nurse
s
cot
covered
was
her
small
kingdom
her
gas
mask
and
helmet
hung
from
the
head
of
the
bed
when
she
was
not
on
duty
her
packed
musette
bag
was
at
the
foot
beneath
the
cot
was
her
suitcase
and
other
possessions
the
day
after
they
moved
into
their
dormitory
nancy
found
a
snake
reposing
in
the
cool
shadows
under
her
cot
he
was
the
harmless
sort
so
with
a
long
stick
she
prodded
him
until
he
decided
to
seek
more
peaceful
quarters
on
the
path
leading
to
the
stream
next
morning
nancy
stuck
her
foot
into
her
shoe
to
find
a
lizard
had
spent
the
night
there
she
tossed
the
inhabited
away
with
such
a
screech
all
her
neighbors
lifted
sleepy
heads
to
see
if
the
japs
had
labeled
a
bomb
for
her
though
nancy
made
light
of
the
small
difficulties
of
their
quarters
her
heart
was
often
heavy
as
she
anxiously
watched
and
prayed
for
vernon
goodwin
s
recovery
during
the
first
hours
after
they
placed
him
in
the
tent
it
seemed
that
life
would
flicker
out
at
any
moment
the
news
got
round
that
vernon
had
been
one
of
tommy
dale
s
bomber
crew
and
the
entire
staff
concentrated
their
efforts
toward
his
recovery
lieutenant
herbert
york
in
charge
of
his
ward
gave
him
every
treatment
that
modern
science
had
discovered
for
restoring
life
to
a
starved
body
to
her
great
satisfaction
they
transferred
nancy
to
his
ward
on
the
fourth
day
vernon
showed
the
first
real
promise
of
recovery
an
hour
after
daylight
nancy
was
scheduled
to
go
off
duty
but
she
didn
t
want
to
leave
vernon
he
had
roused
and
his
lids
had
fluttered
open
several
times
to
the
watching
nurse
s
delight
his
look
of
confusion
had
vanished
wouldn
t
you
like
something
to
eat
she
asked
hopefully
lieutenant
york
said
you
could
have
something
this
he
turned
his
head
and
looked
at
her
a
long
time
you
re
an
american
nurse
he
whispered
as
if
he
could
scarcely
believe
the
wonderful
truth
she
nodded
and
smiled
then
she
took
a
grip
on
herself
to
keep
from
saying
anything
that
would
shock
him
i
suppose
i
don
t
look
very
much
like
one
in
this
seersucker
suit
and
with
my
head
tied
up
but
you
re
safe
in
an
american
hospital
vernon
and
you
re
going
to
get
well
she
assured
him
i
never
thought
it
could
happen
he
whispered
he
turned
his
head
slowly
as
if
looking
for
someone
did
they
bring
the
others
out
he
asked
after
an
interval
who
she
asked
the
rest
of
the
bomber
crew
a
shadow
darkened
his
eyes
was
tommy
with
them
she
asked
then
she
was
frightened
for
fear
his
answer
would
bring
an
end
to
all
her
hopes
no
she
repeated
in
an
agony
of
suspense
he
wouldn
t
come
back
with
wouldn
t
come
back
from
that
island
where
we
went
mean
tommy
really
got
safely
ashore
somewhere
yes
three
of
us
suddenly
vernon
stopped
and
fixed
his
gaze
on
her
did
you
know
tommy
he
s
my
the
ill
man
showed
no
shock
or
surprise
at
this
but
he
stared
at
her
for
some
time
before
he
continued
i
think
i
knew
that
his
tone
grew
more
puzzled
don
t
know
how
unless
it
was
because
you
kept
pulling
me
back
from
the
wouldn
t
let
me
maybe
you
realized
some
of
the
things
we
said
around
you
while
you
were
so
desperately
ill
nancy
told
him
do
you
feel
able
to
tell
me
more
about
tommy
was
he
injured
when
he
jumped
illustration
made
us
leave
him
all
of
us
were
one
way
or
another
tommy
got
his
in
here
the
emaciated
hand
lying
on
the
sheet
indicated
his
stomach
he
made
jim
and
me
start
off
in
our
rubber
boat
we
had
picked
up
some
valuable
information
from
the
japs
that
called
for
counteraction
right
and
he
made
you
leave
him
there
hardest
thing
i
ever
had
to
do
but
he
was
our
captain
and
we
had
to
obey
getting
through
with
that
information
may
save
thousands
of
lives
tommy
told
us
he
was
like
that
tommy
was
by
staying
we
might
ve
saved
him
but
he
wouldn
t
hear
of
it
when
so
much
was
at
but
couldn
t
you
have
brought
him
away
with
you
she
wailed
he
was
too
ill
to
sit
up
that
burning
sun
would
have
finished
him
in
a
few
hours
even
if
the
japs
hadn
t
got
they
did
get
you
before
you
came
through
with
the
information
he
was
silent
a
moment
as
if
gathering
strength
for
the
awful
memories
picked
us
up
at
sea
he
said
finally
we
had
water
food
and
navigation
instruments
and
might
have
made
it
all
she
feared
the
thoughts
of
what
followed
would
be
too
harrowing
and
stopped
him
there
i
ll
go
get
you
some
milk
she
said
then
you
must
rest
before
you
talk
any
nancy
dared
not
weary
vernon
with
more
questioning
just
then
so
was
silent
while
she
fed
him
the
milk
through
a
tube
the
information
he
had
already
given
was
broken
at
intervals
for
him
to
gather
strength
for
the
effort
you
must
sleep
some
more
she
suggested
when
he
had
taken
the
nourishment
and
i
ll
come
back
to
see
you
again
this
for
the
first
time
in
many
weeks
nancy
found
it
impossible
to
sleep
when
she
was
finally
stretched
on
her
cot
she
often
used
a
blinder
across
her
eyes
to
shut
out
the
glare
when
she
had
difficulty
sleeping
in
the
day
but
this
time
it
did
no
good
at
all
she
could
not
stop
the
working
of
her
troubled
mind
even
though
her
tired
body
cried
out
for
rest
nor
did
she
like
to
take
anything
to
make
herself
sleep
for
she
knew
under
the
present
stress
how
easy
it
would
be
to
get
into
such
a
habit
after
tossing
from
side
to
side
for
a
couple
of
hours
she
finally
got
up
and
went
down
to
the
spring
to
do
her
washing
soon
her
undies
and
seersucker
suits
were
flapping
on
a
line
between
two
palm
trees
near
their
shelter
then
she
took
a
bath
in
the
wash
hole
at
the
stream
which
they
had
made
private
by
an
arrangement
of
palm
leaf
screens
when
nancy
was
coming
back
up
the
path
from
the
stream
she
met
major
reed
since
they
had
landed
on
the
island
there
had
been
little
thought
or
time
for
military
formalities
the
entire
unit
from
the
highest
officers
to
the
youngest
shavetails
had
become
a
harmonious
working
whole
however
nancy
saluted
now
as
she
came
face
to
face
with
the
major
on
the
path
he
was
about
to
pass
on
when
suddenly
he
paused
and
said
nancy
there
s
no
need
of
killing
yourself
you
look
all
washed
maybe
i
look
pale
because
i
just
had
a
bath
she
told
him
a
rare
luxury
he
chuckled
and
admitted
you
do
look
mighty
clean
then
almost
immediately
he
was
serious
again
i
ve
just
come
from
your
ward
and
york
told
me
you
worked
long
beyond
your
time
this
more
were
coming
in
than
the
nurses
on
duty
could
handle
she
explained
then
for
fear
she
would
be
given
more
credit
than
she
deserved
nancy
hastened
to
add
and
vernon
goodwin
was
so
much
better
i
thought
he
might
rouse
at
any
moment
and
be
able
to
tell
me
and
did
he
yes
he
did
major
he
told
me
a
little
about
tommy
he
wasn
t
able
to
talk
briefly
nancy
repeated
what
she
had
learned
from
vernon
did
he
know
the
name
of
the
island
where
they
came
down
rather
i
didn
t
ask
him
i
was
afraid
to
let
him
talk
too
much
his
life
still
hangs
by
a
thin
how
long
since
you
talked
with
him
nancy
glanced
at
her
watch
nearly
three
want
to
try
again
oh
yes
if
you
don
t
think
it
would
be
too
much
strain
on
they
went
to
the
ward
and
made
their
way
down
through
the
long
rows
of
cots
they
were
a
pitiful
lot
those
wounded
men
with
bandages
of
every
sort
but
they
wanted
no
pity
for
they
called
themselves
the
lucky
guys
for
having
so
much
comfort
and
attention
some
were
able
to
be
propped
up
for
the
noon
meal
while
others
must
be
patiently
fed
a
liquid
diet
shorty
warner
was
feeding
vernon
a
thin
broth
through
a
tube
when
major
reed
and
nancy
paused
by
his
bed
the
ghost
of
a
smile
flickered
to
the
gunner
s
face
when
he
recognized
nancy
he
asked
for
you
as
soon
as
he
woke
shorty
explained
feel
like
talking
a
bit
old
chap
asked
the
major
touching
the
prematurely
white
head
and
giving
it
a
friendly
pat
think
so
major
i
know
miss
nancy
is
anxious
to
hear
all
about
so
he
was
alive
when
you
left
him
he
was
sir
but
i
fear
he
was
mortally
wounded
think
he
had
a
spatter
of
lead
in
his
have
got
it
when
they
killed
our
though
vernon
s
voice
was
very
weak
nancy
saw
that
talking
was
less
effort
than
it
had
been
earlier
can
you
give
us
an
idea
of
the
location
of
that
island
the
major
asked
not
too
accurate
i
fear
vernon
admitted
i
ve
been
through
such
horrible
things
since
i
d
say
it
s
not
more
than
a
day
s
journey
by
water
from
at
this
information
nancy
s
heart
leaped
up
once
more
with
hope
you
took
that
fatal
flight
you
know
long
before
we
started
cleaning
up
this
area
major
reed
reminded
him
so
the
nurse
was
just
telling
me
i
ve
sort
of
lost
track
of
was
it
a
large
island
asked
nancy
big
enough
for
a
man
to
get
lost
in
its
surrounded
by
reefs
no
large
boat
could
get
in
close
to
its
plenty
like
that
in
this
region
said
major
reed
jim
and
i
passed
no
others
in
our
life
boat
as
we
came
south
then
those
devils
picked
us
what
about
jim
nancy
asked
he
had
a
nasty
wound
in
his
hip
gangrene
ended
his
misery
two
days
after
they
put
us
in
the
prison
camp
i
ve
wished
a
thousand
times
it
could
have
been
me
looking
down
on
this
wreck
of
a
man
nancy
wondered
how
he
had
lived
through
the
ordeal
any
japs
on
the
island
where
you
three
got
ashore
asked
the
major
no
village
there
or
camp
nor
any
sign
there
d
ever
been
any
the
place
was
a
solid
jungle
except
for
a
narrow
fringe
of
beach
but
we
did
find
a
jap
plane
wrecked
on
the
reef
her
crew
had
evidently
all
been
wiped
out
by
our
was
that
where
you
got
the
information
captain
dale
wanted
you
to
bring
back
to
us
vernon
nodded
i
brought
the
jap
papers
away
in
the
lining
of
my
coat
later
when
they
were
found
on
me
those
fiends
stripped
me
of
every
rag
for
fear
i
might
have
more
of
their
information
hidden
in
my
vernon
managed
a
rueful
smile
that
s
why
you
found
me
in
only
a
loin
did
tommy
have
water
and
food
with
him
nancy
asked
you
bet
there
was
a
good
spring
close
by
he
didn
t
need
water
but
we
left
him
most
of
our
food
and
medicine
and
the
supplies
we
took
from
the
zero
we
put
everything
right
to
hand
poor
tommy
was
already
too
miserable
to
crawl
more
than
a
few
feet
from
where
we
left
tears
were
streaming
down
nancy
s
face
but
she
stubbornly
held
to
her
hopes
she
couldn
t
give
tommy
up
now
even
after
hearing
the
worst
it
s
not
likely
he
could
be
living
still
but
don
t
feel
too
badly
about
it
miss
nancy
vernon
said
kindly
there
s
plenty
of
things
worse
than
death
in
this
i
m
afraid
we
ve
let
you
talk
too
much
this
time
said
major
reed
sleep
some
more
now
and
we
ll
see
you
when
nancy
and
the
major
were
outside
she
said
oh
major
do
you
think
there
s
anything
we
could
do
about
it
would
they
be
willing
to
send
a
searching
plane
out
to
look
for
tommy
of
course
they
would
my
dear
but
goodwin
s
information
is
rather
vague
about
some
things
we
ll
wait
till
tomorrow
maybe
with
the
aid
of
a
map
he
ll
be
able
to
give
us
more
accurate
oh
major
i
don
t
know
how
to
thank
you
don
t
have
to
young
lady
captain
dale
is
about
as
important
to
the
air
forces
as
he
is
to
you
we
don
t
give
up
such
men
without
a
they
walked
on
a
few
steps
before
he
added
now
you
must
go
back
and
get
some
rest
we
can
t
afford
to
have
any
sick
nurses
on
our
chapter
eighteen
a
test
vernon
goodwin
had
a
relapse
that
night
and
for
the
next
few
days
nancy
feared
they
had
learned
all
from
him
they
would
ever
know
in
the
meantime
however
glorious
news
was
brought
back
from
the
fighting
front
the
great
number
of
reinforcing
troops
had
finished
the
job
for
which
they
had
come
the
last
nest
of
yellow
jackets
had
been
cleaned
from
the
island
this
news
called
for
such
a
celebration
as
the
nurses
had
not
had
since
july
fourth
for
their
work
had
lightened
somewhat
planes
had
taken
some
of
their
serious
cases
back
to
hospitals
in
australia
even
when
the
wounded
were
brought
in
after
the
final
victory
there
were
still
some
beds
unoccupied
so
the
nurses
found
a
few
hours
out
of
every
to
give
to
personal
needs
once
more
and
a
bit
of
recreation
but
nancy
had
little
heart
for
amusement
during
those
trying
days
she
could
think
of
nothing
but
vernon
goodwin
lying
at
the
point
of
death
and
that
tommy
might
be
alive
still
somewhere
in
that
jungle
a
day
s
boat
ride
to
the
north
ah
snap
out
of
it
nancy
wheedled
mabel
the
afternoon
before
the
party
when
she
came
upon
her
pal
sitting
on
her
cot
staring
into
space
we
ve
all
decided
to
put
on
our
whites
for
the
shindig
it
will
be
good
for
the
morale
of
the
patients
to
see
us
looking
like
real
nurses
for
we
ll
only
make
ourselves
targets
for
the
zeros
that
come
can
t
you
realize
yet
they
ve
cleared
out
those
yellow
jackets
we
ve
got
something
to
celebrate
i
m
really
tired
mabel
said
nancy
stretching
out
on
her
cot
i
honestly
don
t
feel
like
going
up
to
the
mess
hall
to
the
oh
but
honey
you
can
t
miss
it
i
ll
tell
you
something
as
an
inducement
we
have
a
surprise
some
of
the
fuzzy
wuzzies
are
going
to
put
on
a
special
ceremonial
kind
they
use
to
celebrate
their
own
these
island
natives
had
been
most
valuable
in
bringing
back
the
wounded
from
the
fighting
front
ned
holbrook
one
of
nancy
s
patients
who
had
a
broken
back
had
been
brought
out
by
them
on
a
litter
they
were
as
careful
with
me
as
any
mother
ned
told
her
they
saved
my
life
nancy
that
s
sure
i
never
could
have
stood
the
jolting
of
our
ambulance
over
those
corduroy
nancy
had
read
many
articles
in
the
magazines
and
papers
of
australia
about
the
fuzzy
wuzzies
and
the
help
they
had
been
to
the
allies
but
she
had
to
see
them
in
action
to
appreciate
their
amazing
gentleness
and
value
it
seemed
incredible
that
these
men
who
looked
so
savage
with
their
bushy
heads
and
their
bodies
naked
except
for
loin
cloths
could
make
such
good
hospital
aides
she
had
often
wondered
how
they
acted
in
their
native
villages
and
she
knew
the
ceremonial
dance
would
be
something
to
remember
always
the
last
plane
that
came
out
from
australia
explained
mabel
brought
some
packages
from
the
red
cross
for
us
to
give
the
native
helpers
we
opened
one
just
to
see
what
they
contained
boy
will
those
fuzzies
be
thrilled
what
s
in
them
each
one
had
a
loin
cloth
and
a
new
girdle
a
string
of
beads
a
bracelet
an
ornamental
hair
pin
and
a
package
of
mabel
laughed
i
still
can
t
get
used
to
those
men
wearing
fancy
hair
i
m
sure
they
re
meant
more
for
service
than
ornamentation
replied
nancy
yesterday
a
couple
of
fuzzies
came
in
with
a
litter
as
soon
as
we
had
the
wounded
man
on
the
bed
they
sat
down
on
the
ground
nearby
and
began
scratching
their
woolly
heads
with
those
when
they
start
that
i
always
give
them
a
wide
berth
i
don
t
relish
the
idea
of
any
of
the
inhabitants
of
those
bushy
mops
jumping
on
mabel
scratched
her
head
at
the
very
idea
then
added
but
it
will
be
fun
watching
the
dance
and
seeing
them
get
the
i
m
afraid
i
ll
have
to
miss
it
said
nancy
ruefully
as
she
yawned
and
stretched
on
the
cot
mabel
pulled
the
mosquito
net
aside
and
wheedled
ah
come
on
lazy
bones
she
caught
nancy
s
hand
to
pull
her
off
the
cot
then
stopped
suddenly
your
hand
s
hot
as
fire
she
exclaimed
nancy
you
re
not
so
loud
somebody
will
hear
i
m
afraid
i
have
malaria
i
ve
already
started
taking
quinine
think
i
had
a
chill
on
the
ward
just
and
you
stuck
it
numskull
please
mabel
don
t
talk
so
loud
somebody
will
hear
they
may
even
send
me
back
if
they
find
i
have
malaria
i
m
going
to
doctor
myself
and
knock
it
when
that
bug
gets
a
grip
on
you
it
s
not
so
easy
as
you
please
don
t
tell
anyone
mabel
it
would
be
awful
to
be
sent
away
right
now
just
as
i
m
about
to
get
on
tommy
s
of
you
don
t
want
me
to
if
you
re
not
better
in
a
day
or
two
though
you
ve
got
to
see
one
of
the
when
the
nurses
who
shared
their
outdoor
quarters
started
off
to
the
mess
hall
in
white
nancy
said
wistfully
it
sure
makes
me
think
of
home
seeing
you
all
in
mabel
placed
a
glass
of
fruit
juice
on
a
box
under
nancy
s
net
before
leaving
and
ordered
her
to
sleep
the
girls
had
been
gone
only
a
few
minutes
when
nancy
dropped
into
a
feverish
sleep
she
was
roused
some
time
later
by
sounds
of
the
fuzzy
wuzzies
ceremonial
drums
she
went
to
sleep
again
with
them
ringing
in
her
ears
and
didn
t
rouse
till
dawn
she
was
wet
with
perspiration
and
realized
her
fever
had
burned
itself
out
though
she
was
weak
and
her
head
ringing
from
quinine
she
got
into
her
clothes
and
went
on
duty
she
knew
she
would
have
hours
before
a
chill
gripped
her
again
if
her
heavy
doses
of
quinine
were
not
sufficient
yet
to
knock
it
out
how
glad
she
was
afterward
that
she
did
force
herself
to
go
on
duty
as
she
entered
the
ward
to
take
shorty
s
place
her
little
friend
said
vernon
woke
during
the
night
and
asked
for
why
didn
t
you
send
for
me
mabel
wouldn
t
let
me
she
said
you
were
all
in
but
he
s
much
better
this
some
nancy
waited
for
no
more
but
hurried
to
the
gunner
s
bed
he
was
finishing
some
cereal
and
gave
her
a
wan
smile
as
she
drew
near
that
s
the
way
you
must
eat
commented
nancy
taking
his
emptied
mess
kit
you
ll
get
well
i
believe
i
will
miss
nancy
i
may
yet
be
able
to
point
out
that
island
where
we
left
oh
if
you
only
could
vernon
i
believe
i
could
though
a
gunner
doesn
t
bother
his
head
with
where
he
s
enough
to
think
about
to
hit
the
targets
but
i
do
remember
something
about
how
that
island
looked
from
the
air
and
i
sure
had
to
pay
attention
to
directions
when
we
were
leaving
in
that
rubber
is
it
due
north
from
here
she
asked
no
i
d
say
to
the
entirely
surrounded
by
coral
reefs
as
much
as
we
saw
passages
here
and
there
large
enough
for
small
though
vernon
s
voice
was
still
cracked
and
weak
nancy
could
see
he
was
able
to
coordinate
his
thoughts
more
easily
than
during
their
earlier
conversations
major
reed
said
a
searching
plane
would
be
sent
nancy
told
him
but
of
course
we
could
do
nothing
while
you
were
so
has
it
been
very
long
almost
a
sort
of
reaction
i
suppose
from
our
too
vigorous
efforts
to
bring
you
back
but
you
re
going
to
make
it
this
time
she
assured
him
sorry
i
delayed
things
he
apologized
poor
he
s
still
hanging
on
i
guess
he
s
given
up
hope
how
long
has
it
been
i
ve
lost
track
of
the
government
notified
us
that
tommy
was
missing
in
action
on
march
second
this
is
illustration
vernon
goodwin
gained
lord
vernon
groaned
miss
nancy
i
don
t
see
how
he
could
have
made
it
till
now
there
wasn
t
enough
but
there
would
probably
be
fruits
coconuts
fish
like
we
have
on
this
island
tommy
would
find
some
way
to
catch
fish
nancy
said
stubbornly
clinging
to
her
little
shreds
of
hope
it
took
all
the
will
power
she
had
to
keep
on
her
job
that
day
for
she
hadn
t
realized
how
fever
could
sap
one
s
vitality
when
she
started
back
to
her
quarters
in
the
late
afternoon
she
stopped
off
to
tell
major
reed
what
vernon
had
said
as
she
talked
an
odd
expression
came
into
his
face
she
feared
he
had
lost
interest
and
would
not
push
the
searching
expedition
i
m
afraid
vernon
goodwin
won
t
be
well
enough
to
go
with
any
searching
party
before
we
have
to
leave
major
reed
finally
revealed
what
was
on
his
mind
nancy
s
pale
face
grew
more
wan
oh
major
reed
our
job
here
is
almost
finished
planes
can
clear
out
the
patients
faster
and
faster
now
that
koshu
has
been
taken
we
can
expect
orders
for
a
change
at
any
tired
and
ill
as
she
was
the
news
upset
nancy
more
than
anything
had
since
she
first
heard
tommy
was
missing
she
took
a
grip
on
the
tent
pole
to
steady
her
wobbly
knees
major
reed
was
aware
of
her
condition
and
said
you
look
actually
ill
nancy
don
t
drive
yourself
so
up
a
he
turned
away
a
minute
and
rummaged
in
a
box
of
medicines
he
found
a
bottle
of
golden
pills
and
handed
them
to
her
take
these
vitamins
two
a
day
till
you
get
your
pep
nancy
thanked
him
and
hesitated
a
moment
wondering
if
she
ought
to
confess
about
the
chill
yesterday
she
decided
against
it
however
feeling
confident
she
could
take
care
of
herself
she
was
to
wonder
later
if
things
might
have
been
different
had
she
spoken
then
nancy
s
second
chill
struck
her
the
next
morning
before
she
was
out
of
bed
and
at
the
hour
she
should
have
reported
for
duty
she
was
burning
with
fever
mabel
was
scheduled
to
have
the
day
off
so
offered
to
take
nancy
s
place
she
would
report
nancy
in
need
of
a
day
s
rest
and
otherwise
keep
silent
their
other
dormitory
companions
were
also
asked
not
to
betray
her
nancy
kept
up
her
medicine
and
by
dinner
time
that
evening
was
feeling
somewhat
better
hoping
to
evade
too
many
inquiries
she
decided
to
appear
at
the
mess
hall
with
mabel
shorty
and
ida
shorty
and
mabel
were
in
high
spirits
and
kept
them
laughing
with
funny
stories
about
the
fuzzy
wuzzies
throughout
the
meal
and
nancy
s
morale
mounted
several
degrees
the
four
friends
who
had
grown
so
companionable
during
these
months
of
service
little
dreamed
that
was
the
last
meal
they
would
have
together
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
but
their
routine
came
to
an
unexpected
end
just
as
they
were
leaving
the
mess
hall
lieutenant
hauser
rapped
on
the
table
and
called
out
in
her
clear
tone
all
nurses
report
for
instructions
just
outside
the
mess
somethin
cookin
mabel
said
with
conviction
i
ve
felt
it
all
the
nurses
found
major
reed
outside
standing
beside
lieutenant
hauser
under
the
palms
orders
have
come
through
began
the
major
when
he
lifted
his
hand
for
attention
instantly
the
ripple
of
light
talk
ceased
and
every
ear
became
alert
for
the
coming
change
half
of
us
are
to
move
up
to
open
a
new
hospital
the
rest
will
follow
when
this
camp
has
been
cleared
of
patients
the
situation
is
now
so
well
in
hand
that
any
on
koshu
island
needing
special
treatment
may
be
quickly
flown
out
to
larger
nancy
caught
mabel
s
hand
at
this
dreaded
news
it
threatened
to
shatter
all
her
high
hopes
of
an
expedition
to
search
for
tommy
mabel
fully
aware
of
the
cause
of
nancy
s
concern
whispered
consolingly
maybe
you
ll
be
allowed
to
stay
behind
and
see
it
i
m
afraid
no
one
will
push
the
expedition
unless
i
m
here
she
replied
especially
if
vernon
s
sent
back
to
a
base
the
moving
unit
will
be
prepared
to
leave
at
once
the
transport
will
stand
by
to
pick
us
up
at
any
hour
now
explained
major
reed
the
following
nurses
will
leave
for
the
new
he
then
proceeded
to
read
a
list
of
about
names
when
he
called
mabel
s
name
nancy
clutched
at
her
friend
s
hand
desperately
she
had
scarcely
recovered
from
that
shock
before
her
own
name
was
called
weakened
as
she
was
with
illness
and
fatigue
she
had
to
take
a
grip
on
herself
to
keep
back
the
tears
you
re
too
sick
now
to
make
a
change
mabel
said
knowing
how
very
much
nancy
wanted
to
stay
here
i
m
going
to
tell
them
you
ve
been
having
this
was
a
real
temptation
to
nancy
a
week
or
two
longer
on
koshu
might
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world
where
tommy
was
concerned
but
had
she
any
right
to
put
her
own
personal
considerations
ahead
of
this
call
to
more
dangerous
service
they
might
even
think
she
was
using
her
illness
or
tommy
s
rescue
as
an
excuse
to
cling
to
the
safer
work
here
on
koshu
island
her
thoughts
moved
swiftly
but
her
decision
was
unshakable
when
she
replied
no
mabel
i
agreed
to
give
myself
to
this
work
i
ll
go
wherever
they
send
chapter
nineteen
adrift
change
had
always
been
stimulating
to
nancy
but
this
time
she
found
she
could
not
shake
off
her
depression
even
after
she
was
aboard
ship
koshu
island
was
a
safe
haven
she
was
reluctant
to
leave
in
total
darkness
they
went
aboard
the
transport
and
in
total
darkness
they
moved
out
to
sea
again
this
ship
had
detached
itself
from
the
convoy
to
pick
up
the
nurses
and
several
hundred
troops
perhaps
by
daylight
they
would
again
be
part
of
a
great
flotilla
the
air
on
deck
was
cold
after
the
tropical
nights
they
had
endured
ashore
nancy
s
weakened
condition
made
her
to
chill
she
buttoned
her
overcoat
tightly
and
turned
up
her
collar
keeping
her
mae
west
slung
over
her
shoulder
immediately
on
going
aboard
and
even
before
they
were
on
the
move
they
had
an
abandon
ship
drill
and
became
acquainted
with
the
position
of
their
lifeboats
nancy
s
and
mabel
s
boat
was
number
four
not
more
than
fifty
steps
from
the
lounge
where
they
were
to
spend
the
night
there
was
not
a
bunk
left
on
the
tightly
packed
ship
to
assign
to
these
last
passengers
they
were
merely
picked
up
enroute
to
the
ship
s
destination
since
they
expected
to
go
ashore
some
time
the
following
morning
their
discomforts
would
not
be
too
prolonged
i
surely
hate
to
leave
said
mabel
as
koshu
island
became
a
dark
smudge
on
the
horizon
our
life
back
there
will
be
something
to
remember
as
usual
were
hard
for
nancy
too
but
most
of
all
she
had
hated
to
say
to
vernon
goodwin
he
had
brought
tommy
so
close
to
her
once
more
how
she
had
hated
to
disturb
him
with
the
news
of
her
departure
she
had
urged
him
to
insist
that
they
send
out
a
searching
plane
as
soon
as
he
was
able
to
go
i
ve
made
major
reed
promise
to
see
it
through
nancy
told
vernon
now
everything
depends
on
your
speedy
i
ll
do
my
best
he
promised
but
i
surely
hate
to
see
you
no
more
than
i
hate
to
so
much
at
stake
here
she
replied
but
when
you
re
in
the
service
it
s
uncle
sam
who
gives
the
vernon
s
bony
hand
took
hers
a
moment
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
you
miss
nancy
i
doubt
if
i
would
have
come
the
whole
staff
was
pulling
for
you
she
reminded
him
he
saw
how
frail
and
worried
she
looked
and
tried
to
speak
consolingly
you
go
on
to
your
new
duties
with
an
easy
mind
miss
nancy
i
ll
give
em
no
rest
till
a
plane
goes
looking
for
tom
we
ll
bring
him
back
if
he
s
still
on
that
there
were
others
too
whom
nancy
had
left
behind
with
real
hauser
major
reed
ida
and
shorty
were
special
favorites
having
mabel
with
her
however
meant
more
than
any
of
the
others
could
have
they
ll
be
following
pretty
soon
said
mabel
who
seemed
able
to
drift
more
lightly
through
the
changing
currents
of
their
life
than
nancy
could
i
know
that
s
the
program
now
but
you
never
can
tell
what
will
happen
in
this
man
s
they
spoke
almost
in
whispers
for
they
had
been
warned
against
loud
speech
on
deck
the
great
ship
moved
silently
over
the
dark
waters
so
quiet
was
everything
aboard
that
the
wash
of
the
waves
along
the
hull
was
the
only
audible
sound
above
the
low
throb
of
the
engines
only
once
did
they
hear
the
drone
of
a
plane
low
on
the
horizon
their
journey
promised
to
be
as
peaceful
and
uneventful
as
a
summer
excursion
up
the
hudson
mabel
janice
and
a
couple
of
men
officers
made
up
a
bridge
game
toward
midnight
but
nancy
felt
too
exhausted
to
play
with
her
musette
bag
and
helmet
beside
her
her
mae
west
dangling
from
one
shoulder
she
tried
to
get
some
sleep
on
a
couch
by
drawing
her
knees
up
under
her
chin
she
was
fairly
comfortable
the
game
near
by
was
still
going
on
when
she
dozed
at
the
sound
of
a
terrific
explosion
shaking
the
ship
from
prow
to
stem
nancy
woke
with
a
jolt
to
find
herself
on
the
floor
total
darkness
shut
her
in
like
a
pall
while
pandemonium
broke
loose
she
clutched
at
her
buckling
it
into
place
as
she
called
through
the
wild
confusion
mabel
where
are
you
her
friend
must
have
been
sleeping
on
the
floor
near
by
for
she
replied
almost
in
nancy
s
ear
here
so
this
is
it
even
while
she
spoke
there
came
the
thunderous
voice
of
the
captain
through
the
loud
speakers
abandon
ship
we
have
been
struck
we
are
going
down
to
nancy
s
surprise
now
that
the
crisis
was
upon
them
she
felt
calm
and
collected
all
lights
had
gone
out
with
that
first
impact
but
she
had
carefully
memorized
the
route
from
her
couch
to
the
lifeboat
clinging
to
mabel
with
one
hand
she
felt
around
for
her
musette
bag
and
helmet
she
couldn
t
locate
her
helmet
but
she
did
find
her
bag
got
your
bag
she
asked
mabel
went
to
sleep
on
even
as
she
spoke
mabel
fished
out
a
flashlight
dimmed
with
blue
paper
lights
twinkled
here
and
there
as
people
hurried
by
some
babbling
hysterically
others
silently
intent
on
reaching
their
boats
the
deck
listed
with
a
sickening
lurch
just
as
nancy
and
mabel
got
through
the
door
they
went
sliding
with
alarming
speed
toward
the
rail
some
caught
completely
off
their
guard
were
plunged
into
the
water
god
help
us
moaned
mabel
she
s
going
under
before
we
can
get
to
our
no
here
it
is
exclaimed
nancy
swinging
her
own
light
to
a
focus
on
number
four
it
was
one
of
the
smaller
boats
but
three
people
were
already
inside
a
man
gave
them
a
hand
a
woman
spoke
as
they
climbed
in
where
are
the
rest
there
re
supposed
to
be
many
i
don
t
know
mabel
replied
the
woman
s
voice
was
not
that
of
any
of
their
own
nurses
we
can
t
wait
much
longer
said
the
man
she
s
listing
why
don
t
they
hurry
wailed
the
woman
don
t
be
frightened
here
s
someone
now
said
another
man
reassuringly
is
this
number
eight
a
man
s
voice
asked
as
he
stumbled
toward
the
boat
no
but
you
get
in
said
the
man
who
had
spoken
first
no
time
to
hunt
yours
she
s
going
down
any
he
gave
the
man
s
arm
a
jerk
and
pulled
him
into
the
boat
another
man
evidently
a
sailor
let
the
boat
into
the
water
the
ship
lurched
dangerously
and
oily
spray
drenched
the
boat
they
were
not
a
dozen
oar
strokes
away
when
acrid
smoke
billowed
from
every
opening
as
the
ship
suddenly
burst
into
flames
the
oarsmen
had
a
race
to
clear
the
area
where
flames
lapped
at
the
water
it
was
awful
to
see
that
towering
bulk
become
a
flaming
carnival
for
some
jap
watching
through
the
periscope
of
the
sub
that
had
struck
them
a
few
minutes
later
the
mighty
ship
went
down
with
such
an
explosive
churning
of
water
that
those
in
the
lifeboats
had
to
cling
to
the
gunwale
to
keep
from
being
swept
overboard
for
some
time
after
the
flames
were
extinguished
they
drifted
in
stygian
darkness
nancy
couldn
t
even
see
mabel
sitting
next
to
her
in
those
first
stunned
moments
of
escape
nancy
had
been
aware
of
other
boats
around
them
and
people
in
the
water
but
when
they
found
themselves
in
calmer
seas
some
time
after
the
sinking
they
seemed
to
be
utterly
alone
where
are
the
others
the
strange
woman
across
from
them
asked
god
only
knows
replied
her
companion
by
the
location
of
their
voices
nancy
surmised
they
also
were
sitting
side
by
side
there
was
some
comfort
in
feeling
the
physical
nearness
of
another
in
that
vast
empty
darkness
we
ll
drop
anchor
and
ride
it
out
here
till
morning
the
seaman
decided
we
were
due
to
be
in
sight
of
the
convoy
by
dawn
if
they
got
our
sos
somebody
should
pick
us
up
the
last
man
they
had
taken
aboard
had
not
spoken
since
their
arrival
nancy
wondered
if
he
had
gone
overboard
while
the
boat
pitched
so
wildly
after
the
ship
went
down
but
a
few
minutes
later
she
realized
she
was
ankle
deep
in
water
when
she
lifted
her
feet
she
struck
something
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
somebody
s
lying
in
the
bottom
she
exclaimed
she
found
she
had
lost
her
flashlight
in
the
scramble
but
mabel
had
hers
don
t
use
a
flash
warned
the
sailor
those
yellow
devils
can
see
one
miles
they
could
tell
he
was
bending
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
as
he
spoke
then
they
could
hear
him
tugging
at
something
it
s
that
last
chap
who
came
aboard
he
said
he
must
have
been
knocked
lucky
he
knowing
he
has
anything
to
worry
about
said
the
other
man
the
sailor
eased
the
man
s
head
to
a
higher
level
and
began
bailing
out
the
water
but
the
small
boat
heaved
and
pulled
on
her
anchor
chain
so
they
took
in
almost
as
much
as
he
cleared
out
in
another
hour
the
girl
across
from
nancy
was
violently
sick
but
it
was
not
long
before
nancy
mabel
and
the
other
man
were
all
agonizing
over
the
side
of
the
boat
only
the
sailor
and
the
sleeping
man
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
kept
steady
stomachs
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
nancy
prayed
for
death
to
relieve
her
suffering
sick
cold
and
miserable
as
she
was
the
struggle
didn
t
seem
worth
the
effort
from
troubled
dozing
against
mabel
s
shoulder
nancy
woke
to
find
dawn
breaking
on
a
sea
as
empty
and
placid
as
a
mountain
lake
no
rescue
ship
nor
even
any
lifeboat
was
visible
on
all
that
gray
expanse
how
could
she
endure
this
awful
plight
that
daylight
had
revealed
nancy
s
gaze
came
back
from
her
futile
search
to
look
around
at
her
companions
the
bluejacket
sat
on
the
floor
in
the
prow
his
arms
bent
over
the
seat
cradling
his
head
she
discovered
it
was
a
young
corporal
who
had
come
aboard
last
he
still
slept
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
the
girl
across
from
them
was
a
nurse
of
another
unit
she
lay
on
the
seat
the
first
class
private
who
sat
beside
her
couldn
t
have
been
more
than
nineteen
nancy
thought
as
she
studied
the
sleeping
face
everyone
was
covered
with
an
oily
scum
that
had
swept
over
them
from
the
sinking
boat
and
nancy
knew
she
must
look
as
repulsive
as
the
rest
even
before
her
inspection
was
finished
the
sailor
roused
and
dragged
himself
to
the
seat
he
took
one
look
across
the
empty
water
well
if
that
ain
t
a
way
to
do
us
he
growled
when
the
drowsy
corporal
sat
up
and
wanted
to
know
what
the
row
was
about
they
all
beat
it
off
to
safety
without
ever
waiting
to
see
who
else
was
they
may
have
gone
under
for
all
you
know
said
mabel
where
s
the
water
asked
the
corporal
i
m
dry
as
a
you
ll
get
your
share
along
with
the
rest
stated
the
bluejacket
he
had
the
look
of
a
seasoned
seaman
nancy
judged
him
to
be
well
over
thirty
the
oldest
person
aboard
suddenly
he
seemed
to
accept
the
situation
with
what
grace
he
could
he
glanced
around
at
his
and
said
well
ladies
and
gentlemen
looks
like
we
re
in
for
even
while
he
spoke
a
brilliant
red
sun
slowly
became
a
burning
disk
where
sea
and
sky
met
it
seemed
a
warning
of
what
they
had
to
endure
first
thing
in
order
said
the
sailor
is
to
take
stock
of
all
and
nancy
and
mabel
reached
into
their
musette
bags
to
bring
out
their
bars
of
chocolate
and
the
small
tins
of
concentrated
food
to
add
to
the
common
stock
nancy
noticed
that
the
girl
across
from
them
had
her
canteen
but
no
bag
i
see
the
young
ladies
are
good
seamen
and
have
brought
their
canteens
continued
the
sailor
i
have
mine
too
said
the
private
putting
his
hand
to
his
hip
looks
like
i
forgot
mine
said
the
dazed
corporal
making
a
futile
search
for
his
canteen
the
bluejacket
got
out
the
boat
s
supplies
and
stored
with
them
what
nancy
and
mabel
had
contributed
there
was
food
and
water
enough
surely
to
last
until
they
were
picked
up
and
navigation
instruments
too
in
case
no
help
came
illustration
corporal
reached
for
the
water
i
want
some
water
now
demanded
the
complaining
corporal
reaching
for
the
water
keg
between
the
bluejacket
s
feet
you
ll
get
your
water
when
portions
are
dealt
to
all
alike
stated
the
sailor
that
s
what
you
think
growled
the
corporal
and
made
a
lunge
for
the
water
the
young
private
sitting
behind
him
swung
out
a
strong
hand
and
drew
the
man
back
before
he
could
reach
the
sailor
it
took
some
handling
to
get
him
quiet
in
the
stem
of
the
boat
well
away
from
the
frightened
women
you
ll
face
court
martial
for
this
growled
the
corporal
i
m
your
superior
officer
i
m
in
command
of
this
boat
if
anyone
is
put
in
command
it
must
be
one
of
the
nurses
said
the
private
promptly
they
are
all
that
suits
me
fine
said
the
bluejacket
we
know
nothing
about
what
should
be
done
here
nancy
told
them
miserably
or
at
least
i
don
t
i
ll
leave
it
up
to
mabel
she
paused
to
glance
at
the
other
girl
hilda
newton
said
the
strange
nurse
but
heavens
i
have
no
idea
what
we
should
neither
have
i
stated
mabel
if
you
re
all
agreed
i
move
we
put
the
bluejacket
in
command
he
probably
knows
more
about
this
business
than
all
of
us
put
this
met
with
the
hearty
approval
of
all
except
the
surly
still
befuddled
corporal
the
sailor
introduced
himself
as
olan
meyer
and
the
rest
in
turn
told
their
names
a
few
minutes
later
olan
dealt
out
the
morning
s
portion
of
food
and
water
and
so
began
the
monotonous
round
of
nights
and
days
that
were
to
stretch
on
as
endlessly
as
the
sea
on
which
they
drifted
chapter
twenty
the
plane
at
the
end
of
the
first
week
when
there
was
still
no
hope
of
rescue
nor
any
sight
of
land
their
water
had
to
be
reduced
to
one
portion
a
day
only
by
the
notches
olan
meyer
cut
on
the
stem
seat
could
they
tell
how
much
time
had
passed
after
the
first
few
sunrises
days
and
nights
seemed
a
muddled
succession
without
hope
of
ending
once
they
saw
a
smudge
of
smoke
on
the
horizon
but
it
vanished
swiftly
another
time
nancy
thought
she
heard
the
drone
of
a
plane
but
no
moving
speck
appeared
in
all
the
cloudless
blazing
blue
overhead
she
wondered
if
her
mind
was
weakening
and
she
was
beginning
to
hear
sounds
as
a
wanderer
in
the
desert
sees
mirages
on
their
second
day
afloat
nancy
had
had
another
chill
then
to
her
amazement
after
the
fever
had
burned
itself
out
the
attacks
did
not
come
back
her
illness
made
her
think
of
the
small
golden
vitamins
major
reed
had
given
her
she
found
them
still
in
her
musette
bag
by
dealing
them
out
one
a
day
to
each
person
there
would
be
enough
to
last
them
two
weeks
a
sail
had
been
hoisted
after
their
conference
the
first
morning
and
olan
meyer
steered
toward
what
he
believed
was
their
original
destination
but
the
wind
soon
died
down
the
sail
fell
slack
and
it
was
only
useful
as
shade
from
the
blazing
sun
the
day
after
her
fever
cleared
nancy
was
sitting
beside
olan
as
he
studied
the
pacific
map
which
had
been
placed
in
the
lifeboat
along
with
a
book
of
navigation
instructions
where
is
koshu
island
on
this
map
she
asked
after
a
brief
search
he
pointed
it
out
with
a
grimy
finger
do
you
know
of
any
islands
northeast
of
it
she
asked
plenty
why
there
was
a
day
by
water
from
koshu
where
they
tell
me
my
brother
s
plane
went
down
nancy
explained
his
gunner
was
made
a
prisoner
by
the
japs
he
turned
up
at
our
hospital
back
there
on
koshu
soon
as
he
s
able
he
s
going
to
guide
a
plane
back
to
the
got
any
more
details
asked
olan
nothing
except
that
the
island
was
covered
with
a
jungle
as
far
as
vernon
knew
there
were
no
native
villages
and
it
was
surrounded
by
coral
reefs
entirely
so
that
no
big
boats
could
go
close
but
he
said
there
were
passages
where
small
boats
could
enter
the
twelve
hours
journey
north
of
koshu
repeated
olan
while
making
some
mental
calculations
we
must
have
been
somewhere
in
that
neighborhood
when
we
were
oh
are
we
asked
nancy
eagerly
we
were
he
corrected
lord
knows
where
we
re
at
now
a
fair
wind
for
hours
took
us
in
the
opposite
he
pointed
out
where
he
surmised
they
had
been
sunk
and
indicated
the
approximate
direction
in
which
the
wind
had
taken
them
i
figure
the
group
of
reefs
and
islands
you
re
talking
about
is
somewhere
back
and
northeast
of
koshu
she
observed
wouldn
t
it
be
safer
to
try
to
go
back
in
that
direction
you
re
optimistic
lady
distances
in
a
tub
like
this
take
a
hundred
times
longer
to
cover
than
on
our
i
know
that
but
we
may
as
well
be
going
somewhere
definitely
as
drifting
like
this
we
might
even
be
able
to
locate
the
island
where
tommy
was
any
land
no
matter
jungle
would
be
a
thousand
times
better
than
this
said
hilda
newton
it
was
two
days
later
however
before
another
breath
of
wind
came
to
stiffen
their
sail
the
heat
was
almost
unbearable
by
day
while
the
cold
penetrated
to
their
marrow
at
night
nancy
thanked
her
lucky
stars
that
she
had
been
wearing
her
overcoat
at
the
time
they
were
struck
and
that
mabel
had
brought
hers
along
hilda
had
not
been
so
fortunate
when
the
breeze
stirred
at
last
nancy
sat
beside
olan
watching
how
he
set
the
sail
into
the
course
he
desired
it
made
little
difference
to
any
of
the
others
what
direction
they
took
so
long
as
it
brought
an
end
to
their
misery
the
very
fact
that
they
were
moving
boosted
their
morale
but
the
fair
wind
was
only
a
brief
hope
it
fell
away
after
a
few
hours
and
the
horrible
pall
of
inaction
closed
down
on
them
again
sometimes
for
an
hour
or
so
they
would
recite
poetry
tell
jokes
or
ask
to
keep
their
minds
off
reality
in
this
way
the
first
week
dragged
by
not
once
during
that
time
was
there
a
drop
of
rain
to
renew
their
diminishing
water
supply
so
far
they
had
used
only
from
the
lifeboat
s
supply
saving
the
individual
canteens
for
a
reserve
the
corporal
ned
owens
showed
little
improvement
in
disposition
even
after
his
mind
cleared
he
kept
aloof
from
the
others
and
seldom
took
part
in
the
nurses
attempts
to
brighten
their
situation
the
first
few
days
a
fever
kept
him
on
fire
with
thirst
and
he
was
violently
seasick
knowing
something
of
what
he
must
be
enduring
nancy
offered
him
her
portion
of
water
at
the
end
of
an
unusually
hot
day
you
take
it
and
i
ll
knock
your
block
off
olan
flared
when
ned
hesitated
at
the
offer
rather
than
precipitate
a
fight
nancy
finally
drank
the
water
herself
by
the
end
of
the
first
week
the
feud
between
the
two
men
which
started
with
selfishness
on
one
side
and
firmness
on
the
other
had
grown
to
alarming
proportions
every
time
olan
dealt
out
the
water
ned
accused
him
of
giving
him
less
than
his
portion
one
evening
after
they
had
sat
through
the
worst
heat
they
had
yet
endured
ned
demanded
that
olan
give
him
his
entire
allotment
of
water
and
let
him
drink
it
as
he
pleased
i
won
t
do
it
you
haven
t
got
the
grit
to
restrain
yourself
olan
stated
nancy
had
been
surprised
to
find
just
before
their
evening
ritual
of
food
and
drink
that
ned
had
moved
next
to
olan
on
the
boat
seat
suddenly
just
as
olan
was
measuring
out
a
portion
of
water
ned
s
arm
swung
round
and
struck
him
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
caught
unawares
the
keg
slipped
from
olan
s
hand
to
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
the
precious
fluid
gurgled
out
into
the
bilge
water
while
the
two
men
went
into
a
grip
nancy
grabbed
the
keg
from
under
their
feet
but
she
was
not
quick
enough
to
save
more
than
half
of
the
remaining
water
she
dragged
the
keg
with
her
toward
the
prow
as
the
raging
men
grappled
jim
benton
and
hilda
were
sitting
in
the
prow
and
the
slack
sail
had
at
first
cut
off
their
view
of
what
was
happening
the
men
were
already
at
each
other
s
throats
before
jim
realized
there
was
a
row
and
rushed
to
separate
them
terrified
the
women
feared
the
struggle
would
capsize
the
boat
they
huddled
together
in
the
prow
to
keep
a
balance
the
corporal
was
a
much
larger
man
than
the
bluejacket
and
soon
had
him
down
on
the
seat
his
hands
clawing
at
his
throat
jim
could
not
break
their
grip
with
his
bare
hands
hilda
had
snatched
up
one
of
the
oars
as
if
to
help
suddenly
he
seized
it
from
her
and
cracked
it
down
over
ned
owens
s
head
the
corporal
crumpled
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
like
a
crushed
egg
the
moment
his
hands
relaxed
their
grip
on
olan
s
throat
the
man
rolled
into
the
water
with
a
list
of
the
boat
without
a
moment
s
hesitation
jim
benton
went
in
after
him
shoes
and
all
the
shock
of
the
cold
water
revived
olan
s
faculties
sufficiently
for
him
to
get
a
death
grip
on
jim
in
spite
of
all
the
soldier
could
do
to
break
the
hold
olan
pulled
him
down
under
the
waves
with
him
the
horrified
women
stared
helpless
to
save
either
one
nancy
was
making
a
motion
to
get
out
of
her
shoes
when
mabel
held
her
back
by
main
force
you
re
insane
she
screamed
you
haven
t
strength
to
do
anything
for
but
it
was
already
too
late
even
while
mabel
held
nancy
back
the
two
men
went
down
again
and
they
saw
them
no
more
too
stunned
for
speech
they
could
only
stand
and
stare
hoping
against
hope
that
they
might
come
up
again
then
hilda
the
little
girl
wavered
and
mabel
gently
eased
her
to
the
bottom
of
the
boat
as
consciousness
slipped
from
her
after
bathing
her
face
with
sea
water
mabel
and
nancy
dragged
her
up
to
the
boat
seat
and
nancy
held
her
head
in
her
lap
for
a
long
time
they
were
too
stunned
for
speech
mabel
was
the
first
to
say
anything
as
she
stared
with
fixed
eyes
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
now
we
re
left
to
the
mercy
of
that
thing
she
moaned
pointing
to
the
corporal
it
would
be
better
if
we
were
all
dead
said
nancy
in
a
hollow
voice
mabel
finally
prodded
ned
owens
with
her
foot
turning
him
over
blood
flowed
from
the
gash
on
the
back
of
his
head
made
by
the
oar
even
though
she
dreaded
to
see
him
regain
consciousness
the
instincts
of
her
profession
would
not
be
denied
she
finally
squatted
in
the
bilge
water
to
do
what
she
could
for
his
injuries
she
cleaned
the
wound
after
a
fashion
and
dusted
it
with
some
sulfa
drug
from
her
kit
then
drew
the
edges
together
with
some
sticking
plaster
they
feared
he
would
roll
into
the
sea
if
they
dragged
him
to
the
seat
so
they
pulled
him
into
the
prow
where
only
his
feet
were
in
the
water
when
hilda
stirred
again
she
sat
up
her
fixed
eyes
turned
across
the
waves
that
had
swallowed
the
men
she
was
like
one
under
the
influence
of
dope
and
made
no
complaint
only
sat
there
hour
after
hour
as
if
the
life
had
gone
from
her
too
mabel
took
a
last
look
at
ned
in
the
twilight
and
saw
he
was
still
breathing
though
he
showed
no
signs
of
regaining
consciousness
if
he
ll
only
stay
that
way
till
morning
she
said
i
ll
feel
much
for
once
mabel
s
wish
was
fulfilled
the
first
rays
of
daylight
revealed
the
corporal
lying
where
she
had
left
him
she
bent
over
him
almost
eagerly
her
shaking
fingers
that
pressed
his
wrist
found
no
pulse
god
is
good
she
said
fervently
looking
up
from
her
knees
at
the
other
two
no
telling
what
we
ve
been
his
passing
was
such
a
relief
to
them
all
that
even
hilda
found
interest
enough
to
help
them
heave
the
body
over
into
the
sea
when
the
lapping
green
water
had
swallowed
him
up
nancy
said
let
s
recite
the
psalm
for
our
she
emphasized
the
all
for
in
spite
of
their
relief
at
this
last
death
she
felt
that
none
should
be
excluded
from
their
simple
burial
ritual
with
the
knowledge
of
navigation
that
she
had
picked
up
from
olan
nancy
steered
a
southeast
course
with
every
fair
wind
that
blew
though
their
number
was
now
only
half
the
original
she
dared
not
increase
their
water
supply
as
so
much
had
been
lost
when
their
keg
overturned
by
careful
economy
they
would
have
food
and
water
for
a
few
more
days
after
the
death
of
the
three
men
they
rarely
spoke
there
seemed
nothing
left
to
say
and
speech
was
such
an
effort
with
rasping
vocal
chords
and
cracked
lips
once
they
sighted
a
smudge
of
smoke
that
promised
to
be
a
boat
on
the
horizon
though
there
was
always
the
possibility
it
might
be
a
japanese
boat
even
captivity
seemed
preferable
to
their
present
condition
nancy
tacked
to
catch
a
bit
of
wind
taking
her
in
that
direction
but
a
nearer
approach
showed
them
it
was
merely
mist
from
spray
breaking
on
a
reef
but
the
island
was
barren
with
not
a
single
palm
to
pierce
the
burning
sky
before
night
closed
them
in
they
saw
other
reefs
but
all
were
barren
they
decided
to
lower
their
sail
and
drop
anchor
for
the
night
to
keep
the
current
from
sweeping
them
against
some
hidden
reef
twice
during
that
day
nancy
had
thought
she
heard
the
drone
of
a
distant
plane
if
any
had
passed
they
had
been
hidden
by
fleecy
clouds
in
the
following
day
they
were
becalmed
again
under
a
cloudless
sky
by
crouching
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
during
the
hottest
hours
they
could
shade
their
heads
under
the
boat
seat
making
the
heat
slightly
more
endurable
nancy
was
lying
there
almost
in
a
coma
when
there
came
the
sound
of
a
plane
clear
and
not
too
far
away
for
a
moment
she
did
not
stir
believing
it
the
sound
she
had
imagined
a
score
of
times
before
then
suddenly
mabel
called
out
nancy
it
a
plane
i
can
see
it
coming
this
way
hilda
added
hoist
the
sail
they
can
see
us
easier
with
the
sail
up
cried
mabel
her
last
reserve
of
strength
pouring
out
into
action
the
three
of
them
tugged
at
the
sail
a
moment
then
mabel
stopped
to
bend
over
her
musette
bag
i
m
going
to
try
flashing
a
mirror
at
them
she
explained
she
opened
her
compact
containing
a
mirror
almost
as
large
as
her
palm
i
ve
heard
of
people
catching
the
sun
s
rays
in
a
mirror
and
attracting
planes
that
they
had
discussed
this
as
one
device
for
getting
the
attention
of
fliers
in
the
early
days
of
their
shipwreck
nancy
and
hilda
got
the
limp
sail
up
while
mabel
set
the
mirror
to
catch
the
sun
s
rays
and
reflect
them
toward
the
approaching
plane
then
they
realized
that
the
silver
speck
was
not
coming
straight
over
but
would
pass
well
to
the
south
oh
dear
god
make
it
come
on
prayed
mabel
both
the
other
nurses
were
praying
too
in
a
frenzy
of
hope
and
despair
mabel
tried
the
mirror
trick
she
had
practiced
several
times
three
long
flashes
from
the
mirror
then
three
short
then
three
again
and
again
she
repeated
the
signal
but
the
plane
kept
steadily
on
its
course
nancy
felt
she
couldn
t
endure
to
see
it
go
entirely
out
of
sight
moaning
she
pressed
her
face
into
the
slack
sail
and
leaned
against
their
mast
certain
this
was
their
last
hope
chapter
rescued
oh
mabel
they
re
going
on
they
don
t
see
us
wailed
nancy
when
the
plane
dipped
low
on
the
horizon
better
a
thousand
times
that
they
had
never
seen
it
at
all
than
to
endure
this
agony
of
disappointment
but
mabel
was
too
intent
upon
her
sun
and
mirror
trick
to
heed
nancy
s
despair
she
shifted
her
position
as
the
plane
moved
on
and
continued
flashing
the
mirror
into
the
sky
suddenly
hilda
cried
out
re
turning
they
ve
seen
incredible
as
it
seemed
the
plane
was
swinging
back
toward
them
but
it
was
still
very
high
as
it
came
on
it
may
be
a
jap
hilda
dropped
the
words
like
a
bomb
into
their
midst
they
had
been
so
obsessed
with
the
hope
of
rescue
by
their
own
people
that
their
dulled
minds
had
not
counted
on
that
possibility
too
late
now
said
mabel
they
evidently
saw
my
light
could
any
thing
be
worse
than
this
asked
nancy
their
bloodshot
sunken
eyes
watched
in
an
agony
of
suspense
as
the
drone
of
the
plane
beat
harder
and
harder
on
their
sensitive
ears
that
were
so
long
conditioned
to
silence
suddenly
nancy
s
straining
eyes
recognized
the
insignia
of
her
own
air
force
and
she
burst
forth
above
the
roar
of
the
plane
that
was
now
almost
overhead
there
s
our
white
star
in
the
blue
circle
it
s
one
of
our
planes
they
began
waving
frantically
as
the
plane
circled
high
above
them
the
pilot
was
obviously
taking
no
chances
that
this
might
be
some
trick
of
the
japs
from
the
burned
color
of
their
skins
they
could
be
mistaken
for
japs
from
above
then
nancy
thought
of
the
american
flag
she
always
kept
in
her
musette
bag
with
the
battered
confederate
relic
it
was
rather
small
but
surely
bright
enough
to
be
distinguished
from
above
she
was
trembling
like
a
leaf
in
a
gale
when
she
found
it
and
waved
it
aloft
almost
immediately
the
plane
dipped
lower
why
it
s
a
hydro
burst
forth
mabel
the
great
ship
sped
south
again
dipping
nearer
the
water
about
a
mile
away
she
turned
back
skimming
above
the
waves
until
she
settled
down
with
a
great
splash
and
came
gliding
easily
toward
them
then
the
broad
wings
were
at
rest
and
the
motor
silent
a
hearty
voice
from
the
plane
called
out
can
you
row
closer
we
ll
try
replied
nancy
but
she
feared
her
faint
cracked
voice
did
not
cover
the
distance
between
them
the
oars
had
not
been
touched
since
that
horrible
day
when
the
men
had
died
mabel
found
one
under
the
seat
two
of
them
could
scarcely
handle
it
they
could
as
well
have
used
toothpicks
for
all
the
movement
their
feeble
efforts
brought
we
can
t
make
it
wailed
nancy
and
would
have
wept
had
her
eyes
not
been
too
burned
out
for
tears
never
mind
we
ll
come
over
replied
a
kindly
voice
a
rubber
boat
appeared
under
the
plane
wings
and
two
men
paddled
it
easily
toward
them
when
hilda
fell
twice
in
trying
to
get
over
the
gunwale
one
of
the
fliers
stepped
aboard
and
took
her
wasted
form
into
his
arms
though
nancy
and
mabel
were
both
weak
and
trembling
with
excitement
they
managed
to
get
into
the
rubber
boat
with
the
help
of
the
second
man
the
other
man
went
back
for
their
coats
and
bags
and
soon
they
were
under
the
shadow
of
the
great
wings
eager
hands
lifted
them
bodily
into
the
cabin
nancy
could
never
recall
afterward
all
that
was
said
and
done
as
they
were
lifted
inside
but
she
did
remember
one
man
s
hushed
voice
as
he
said
three
army
illustration
hands
lifted
them
bodily
into
the
those
men
in
their
spotless
clothes
seemed
like
angels
to
the
shipwrecked
women
they
were
put
into
bunks
and
almost
as
if
by
magic
someone
was
handing
nancy
a
thermos
top
filled
with
hot
tea
these
things
couldn
t
be
real
she
kept
telling
herself
she
had
only
hoped
they
would
happen
for
so
long
that
now
she
believed
they
could
not
be
true
a
doctor
the
fliers
called
lieutenant
holmes
questioned
them
about
how
much
they
had
had
to
eat
and
drink
then
allowed
them
to
have
a
small
portion
of
concentrated
food
from
a
tin
and
gave
them
a
cup
of
water
but
nancy
came
back
to
her
thermos
top
of
tea
it
seemed
heavenly
to
have
something
hot
she
could
feel
reviving
strength
flow
to
her
very
toes
good
thing
we
brought
that
hot
thermos
along
one
of
the
men
remarked
thought
tom
would
appreciate
it
replied
his
companion
nancy
stared
incredulously
at
the
man
tom
she
repeated
i
had
a
brother
named
tom
he
was
lost
she
saw
the
men
look
at
each
other
tom
brother
asked
the
flier
who
had
given
her
her
food
she
nodded
you
can
t
nancy
dale
army
nurse
she
replied
suddenly
a
man
in
army
clothes
turned
sharply
from
where
he
held
a
can
of
food
for
hilda
and
stared
at
her
then
nancy
saw
that
the
hair
under
his
cap
was
snow
white
her
eyes
so
long
conditioned
to
the
glare
could
see
little
when
she
was
brought
inside
but
now
she
stared
at
this
man
incredulously
was
this
another
mirage
she
brushed
her
hands
across
her
hollow
eyes
and
looked
again
take
it
easy
said
the
man
with
the
pale
thin
face
you
re
going
to
be
all
right
miss
nancy
i
didn
t
recognize
you
at
you
can
t
be
vernon
she
whispered
but
i
am
he
assured
her
you
asked
us
to
come
out
and
look
for
tommy
and
here
we
you
ve
found
him
we
re
on
our
way
to
pick
him
up
now
vernon
explained
but
you
d
better
lie
down
now
and
keep
yourself
quiet
or
you
won
t
be
able
to
greet
him
when
we
take
him
he
forced
her
to
lie
down
and
she
glanced
across
to
see
others
looking
after
mabel
and
hilda
you
may
not
find
him
she
said
wearily
a
person
can
stand
just
so
she
felt
it
would
not
be
so
terrible
after
all
if
tommy
were
really
dead
those
who
had
known
bitter
depths
of
suffering
had
told
her
many
times
that
there
were
things
worse
than
death
and
in
those
awful
days
adrift
she
had
learned
it
was
true
she
had
even
stopped
praying
that
tommy
might
live
how
could
she
have
been
so
cruel
all
along
as
to
try
to
hold
him
to
a
life
of
such
hardships
a
plane
has
already
been
over
the
island
vernon
explained
in
answer
to
her
doubts
a
man
signaled
us
from
the
beach
it
must
ve
been
when
she
asked
we
thought
we
heard
a
plane
yesterday
why
didn
t
you
rescue
him
then
there
was
no
place
to
land
only
a
seaplane
can
get
near
the
great
motors
of
the
plane
roared
into
action
again
as
vernon
finished
speaking
he
motioned
her
to
lie
back
and
rest
for
even
his
voice
was
not
yet
strong
enough
to
carry
above
that
roar
nancy
had
a
struggle
to
force
her
mind
to
any
degree
of
calmness
the
swift
changes
of
the
last
few
minutes
and
her
renewed
hope
about
tommy
brought
an
enervating
reaction
though
the
island
where
tommy
had
been
marooned
was
the
goal
of
their
sailing
from
the
time
olan
learned
of
it
nancy
could
scarcely
believe
they
had
actually
come
within
reasonable
range
of
it
that
the
rescue
expedition
which
she
had
instigated
back
on
koshu
island
would
be
the
means
of
saving
her
own
life
too
seemed
now
almost
uncanny
this
war
had
certainly
woven
some
strange
and
incredible
designs
into
the
tapestry
of
life
so
relieved
was
she
to
sink
into
the
comfort
of
that
berth
and
know
she
would
be
taken
back
to
safety
that
not
even
her
suspense
about
tommy
kept
off
her
drowsiness
as
the
plane
gained
height
she
felt
as
she
once
had
when
going
under
an
anesthetic
some
time
later
a
gentle
hand
on
her
cheek
roused
her
we
re
flying
over
the
island
vernon
said
in
her
ear
she
was
confused
for
a
moment
then
asked
is
there
a
window
where
i
can
look
out
he
helped
her
down
and
over
to
a
window
from
where
she
could
see
the
verdant
blotch
entirely
surrounded
by
a
blue
lagoon
fringed
with
reefs
on
which
tumbling
waves
broke
an
emerald
set
in
sapphire
and
pearls
the
plane
crossed
the
island
at
great
height
then
circled
and
came
back
much
lower
just
leaving
a
safe
margin
above
the
towering
palms
he
signaled
from
the
western
shore
vernon
said
nancy
saw
the
gunner
s
hand
tremble
violently
as
he
steadied
himself
against
the
seat
in
front
the
great
ship
roared
south
then
north
above
the
western
shore
of
the
island
there
he
is
there
he
is
cried
nancy
tears
of
joy
streaming
down
her
thin
cheeks
there
really
was
a
man
waving
something
white
from
the
way
he
ran
back
and
forth
nancy
saw
he
was
not
weak
from
hunger
as
she
was
a
few
minutes
later
the
plane
moved
off
a
safe
distance
from
the
reefs
and
taxied
cautiously
nearer
one
of
the
inlets
a
small
rubber
motorboat
manned
by
three
men
headed
toward
a
passage
in
the
barrier
reef
nancy
wondered
if
she
could
live
through
the
interval
until
she
could
know
if
the
marooned
man
was
really
tommy
she
and
vernon
crossed
to
the
opposite
window
which
gave
a
view
toward
the
island
but
the
plane
was
too
low
for
them
to
see
beyond
the
high
waves
pounding
on
the
reef
i
m
sure
i
look
like
a
scarecrow
said
nancy
suddenly
aware
of
her
looks
could
they
spare
me
a
little
water
to
try
to
scrub
some
of
the
grime
off
my
face
and
hands
vernon
put
a
bit
of
water
in
a
helmet
and
took
a
folded
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
to
use
as
a
washcloth
he
even
produced
a
small
piece
of
soap
though
nancy
scrubbed
and
scrubbed
and
felt
slightly
better
for
the
performance
she
decided
that
nothing
less
than
a
day
s
soaking
in
hot
water
would
produce
satisfactory
results
she
saw
that
mabel
and
hilda
still
slept
and
she
left
them
in
peace
already
she
was
beginning
to
wonder
when
they
would
let
her
have
more
water
and
another
portion
of
food
but
lieutenant
holmes
had
been
very
positive
in
dealing
out
the
amount
they
could
have
at
first
vernon
and
captain
crawford
the
young
pilot
filled
the
seemingly
interminable
interval
by
asking
nancy
about
the
shipwreck
while
she
gave
them
the
horrible
details
nancy
s
gaze
kept
turning
toward
that
door
through
which
the
boatmen
would
return
how
long
were
you
adrift
asked
captain
crawford
nancy
shook
her
head
i
m
not
sure
olan
meyer
made
notches
on
the
stern
seat
until
he
that
it
didn
t
seem
to
matter
there
re
seven
notches
on
the
they
left
koshu
island
on
october
third
vernon
recalled
this
is
the
thirteen
days
said
nancy
seems
more
like
thirteen
she
glanced
toward
the
door
again
why
don
t
they
come
back
could
they
have
struck
a
reef
the
captain
glanced
at
his
watch
not
quite
time
but
even
as
he
spoke
the
throb
of
the
motorboat
beat
on
their
ears
again
they
re
coming
she
cried
and
staggered
toward
the
exit
minutes
had
never
seemed
so
long
to
nancy
but
eventually
the
boat
came
into
range
aquiver
with
expectancy
she
searched
the
faces
of
the
boatmen
then
her
gaze
came
to
rest
on
a
man
with
a
long
brown
beard
sick
with
suspense
for
she
could
not
believe
that
man
was
tommy
she
wavered
and
the
oncoming
boat
blurred
she
felt
vernon
s
arm
about
her
waist
steadying
her
suspense
fear
then
incredible
joy
followed
in
swift
succession
for
tommy
was
calling
her
name
her
head
was
whirling
so
that
he
seemed
very
far
away
but
there
he
was
really
stepping
into
the
plane
a
moment
later
she
was
in
his
arms
then
all
her
agony
was
dissolved
in
complete
joy
for
his
arms
about
her
gave
assurance
that
their
suffering
was
over
they
told
me
you
were
here
he
said
when
he
could
command
himself
to
speak
and
also
about
the
horrible
things
you
ve
been
no
more
awful
than
half
so
bad
she
said
looking
up
into
his
eyes
that
had
been
so
much
like
hers
before
her
own
became
so
hollow
after
the
first
month
i
didn
t
fare
so
badly
he
reassured
her
for
a
while
i
didn
t
believe
i
d
make
it
since
my
stomach
healed
though
it
s
been
you
don
t
look
starved
she
said
a
man
can
live
a
long
time
on
fruit
roots
coconuts
and
fish
but
say
will
i
be
glad
to
have
a
real
meal

more
