william
blake
the
narrow
house
part
i
the
hot
bright
street
looked
almost
deserted
a
sign
swung
before
the
disheveled
building
at
the
corner
and
on
a
purple
ground
one
could
read
the
notice
robinson
son
builders
painted
in
tall
white
letters
some
broken
plaster
had
been
thrown
from
one
of
the
windows
and
lay
on
the
dusty
sidewalk
in
a
glaring
heap
the
house
next
door
was
as
badly
in
need
of
improvements
as
the
one
undergoing
alterations
the
dingy
brick
walls
were
streaked
by
the
drippage
from
the
leaky
tin
gutter
that
ran
along
the
roof
the
massive
shutters
thrown
back
from
the
long
windows
were
rotting
away
below
the
lifted
panes
very
clean
worn
curtains
hung
slack
like
things
exhausted
by
the
heat
some
papers
had
been
thrust
in
the
tin
letter
box
before
the
clumsy
dark
green
door
and
as
farley
emerged
from
the
house
she
stopped
to
glance
at
them
before
descending
to
the
street
one
of
the
papers
had
a
kansas
city
postmark
and
she
thought
it
must
have
come
for
her
husband
from
a
certain
woman
whom
she
was
trying
to
forget
she
placed
the
papers
clumsily
back
where
she
had
found
them
as
she
passed
down
the
stone
stairs
she
stooped
to
toss
a
bright
scrap
of
orange
peel
to
the
gutter
she
sighed
as
she
did
it
not
even
taking
the
trouble
to
brush
the
dust
from
the
shabby
white
cotton
gloves
she
wore
her
skirt
was
too
long
behind
and
as
she
dragged
her
feet
across
the
pavement
it
swept
the
ground
after
her
she
glanced
into
the
place
which
was
being
repaired
and
wished
that
something
might
be
done
to
improve
her
home
at
any
rate
now
that
her
winnie
had
become
reconciled
to
her
parents
things
would
be
better
and
price
were
rich
they
had
a
carriage
and
an
automobile
farley
told
herself
that
it
was
because
of
her
grandchildren
that
the
end
of
the
long
family
quarrel
brought
some
relief
winnie
two
babies
a
girl
and
a
boy
would
now
enjoy
many
things
which
the
farleys
had
not
been
able
to
provide
farley
thought
of
them
going
to
church
in
fine
carriage
farley
knew
that
she
should
have
taken
the
part
of
her
son
laurence
who
had
been
responsible
for
the
disagreement
but
somehow
it
had
been
impossible
to
condemn
winnie
the
poor
girl
was
not
strong
laurie
was
a
harsh
man
he
was
stubborn
he
did
not
forgive
easily
and
would
suffer
everything
rather
than
admit
himself
in
the
wrong
he
had
been
like
that
as
a
youth
and
idly
as
one
in
a
boat
allows
a
hand
to
trail
along
the
silken
surface
of
the
water
the
woman
allowed
her
mind
to
drift
with
the
surface
of
long
past
events
she
had
reached
the
butcher
shop
had
almost
gone
by
it
how
do
you
do
farley
nice
warm
weather
we
having
the
butcher
had
a
hooked
nose
and
when
he
smiled
it
seemed
to
press
down
his
thick
brown
mustache
that
framed
his
even
white
teeth
so
beautifully
he
settled
his
apron
over
his
stomach
and
gazed
at
her
hungrily
and
affectionately
above
the
glass
top
of
the
counter
as
though
he
were
trying
to
hypnotize
her
into
buying
some
of
the
coral
pink
sausages
which
reposed
beside
a
block
of
ice
in
the
transparent
case
the
meat
shop
was
as
white
as
death
it
smelt
of
blood
and
sawdust
and
its
tiled
interior
offered
a
refuge
from
the
heat
without
i
want
a
piece
of
can
you
give
me
a
nice
rib
roast
today
no
what
do
you
ask
for
those
hens
farley
as
always
hesitated
when
she
spoke
and
lines
as
fine
as
hairs
traced
themselves
on
her
pale
dry
hastily
powdered
forehead
her
vague
rather
squinting
eyes
traveled
undecidedly
over
the
big
pieces
of
meat
the
shoulders
the
forelegs
the
haunches
of
different
shades
of
red
streaked
with
tallow
or
suet
that
swung
on
hooks
in
the
shadow
against
the
tiling
of
the
walls
the
fowls
dangled
in
a
row
a
little
to
the
fore
of
the
meat
the
feet
of
the
hens
were
a
sickly
bluish
yellow
and
the
toes
cramped
together
yet
flaccid
still
suggested
the
fatigue
which
follows
agony
the
eyes
bulged
under
thin
lids
and
on
the
heads
and
necks
about
the
beaks
bunches
of
reddish
brown
feathers
had
been
left
as
decorations
the
butcher
took
one
down
and
laying
it
on
the
counter
pinched
up
the
plump
flesh
between
his
forefinger
and
thumb
you
could
never
find
a
better
fed
hen
than
that
he
told
her
nice
firm
solid
meat
you
see
they
are
just
in
and
i
was
so
sure
of
getting
rid
of
them
i
did
not
even
put
them
on
the
ice
yet
they
not
storage
fowls
i
buy
them
from
a
young
man
who
has
a
farm
out
near
where
my
sister
lives
at
southbridge
farley
in
spite
of
a
gala
occasion
and
the
fact
that
and
price
were
to
do
her
the
condescension
of
coming
to
dinner
at
her
house
the
next
day
had
not
intended
to
buy
anything
so
expensive
as
chicken
for
all
those
people
it
would
take
two
hens
but
though
she
tried
her
best
not
to
allow
the
butcher
to
catch
her
eye
she
knew
he
was
staring
at
her
intently
and
that
the
white
teeth
were
flashing
almost
cruelly
under
the
brown
mustache
beneath
the
hooked
nose
it
heightened
a
conviction
of
weakness
which
she
never
failed
to
experience
when
she
was
called
upon
to
decide
anything
especially
in
the
presence
of
other
people
and
she
wished
she
had
asked
alice
to
buy
the
meat
before
she
went
to
work
of
course
alice
would
spend
too
much
but
what
she
got
was
sure
to
be
nice
and
the
diners
were
certain
to
praise
it
i
will
take
two
of
the
hens
said
farley
moistening
the
dry
down
along
her
lips
be
sure
you
give
me
fat
ones
she
went
on
frowning
while
she
fumbled
in
the
pocketbook
for
the
money
she
did
not
cease
to
be
aware
of
the
pleasant
confident
manner
of
the
butcher
as
with
deft
fingers
he
ran
his
hand
into
the
bird
and
with
a
slight
clawing
sound
tore
out
a
heap
of
discolored
entrails
so
neatly
that
not
one
burst
then
he
slit
the
chicken
neck
and
extracted
its
crop
farley
was
anxious
to
get
away
she
never
had
any
peace
of
mind
except
when
she
was
by
herself
i
sure
you
will
be
pleased
declared
the
butcher
with
a
slight
bow
as
he
took
the
money
she
handed
him
her
short
white
hand
was
corded
with
bluish
veins
and
her
fingers
were
slightly
knotted
and
bent
from
gout
they
had
hovered
almost
palpitantly
over
her
worn
black
purse
while
she
tried
to
make
up
her
mind
whether
to
give
him
the
exact
amount
or
to
ask
him
to
change
the
five
dollars
which
alice
had
turned
over
to
her
that
morning
at
last
she
gave
him
the
five
dollars
and
when
he
counted
the
sum
due
her
into
her
palm
the
dull
brightness
of
the
pieces
of
money
swam
slightly
before
her
eyes
and
she
had
no
idea
whether
or
not
the
amount
returned
to
her
was
what
was
owing
the
butcher
bowed
again
managing
to
appear
deferential
where
shall
i
send
them
he
asked
inclining
his
ear
toward
her
and
in
a
low
hurried
voice
she
recalled
the
number
he
had
forgotten
they
must
be
sent
right
away
she
insisted
or
i
ca
get
them
ready
with
a
gallant
inclination
of
the
head
the
butcher
promised
to
send
them
at
once
she
made
her
way
through
the
gloom
and
as
she
pushed
the
screen
door
open
a
large
blue
fly
rose
stupidly
and
bumped
against
her
face
she
was
obliged
to
go
to
the
grocer
and
to
the
bakery
and
when
she
approached
her
home
again
it
was
already
three
in
the
afternoon
may
winnie
little
girl
an
unhealthy
looking
child
with
lustrous
skin
large
vapid
glazed
blue
eyes
and
thin
damp
curls
of
hair
which
clung
to
her
hollow
shoulders
rose
from
the
shadowed
doorstep
hello
grandma
she
called
with
one
hand
smoothing
the
front
of
her
faded
pink
gingham
dress
while
with
the
other
she
pressed
her
weight
against
the
grimy
iron
balustrade
farley
eyes
frowned
wearily
but
a
conscientious
smile
came
to
her
lips
that
were
twisted
a
little
with
repugnance
where
mamma
may
she
asked
not
looking
at
the
child
is
she
lying
down
may
sucked
her
middle
finger
and
wagged
her
head
from
side
to
side
her
smile
was
vacant
in
its
timorous
interest
do
you
want
to
take
one
of
my
bundles
may
nodded
her
head
up
and
down
and
accepted
the
parcel
her
small
arm
twined
around
it
loosely
the
front
door
was
ajar
opening
into
a
familiar
smelling
twilight
and
she
hopped
after
her
grandmother
into
the
house
as
farley
entered
the
darkened
bedroom
winnie
in
a
cheap
fancy
négligé
of
lilac
and
pink
rose
from
an
old
lounge
and
came
forward
to
meet
her
winnie
small
pointed
face
was
haggard
and
smeary
with
tears
she
gazed
at
her
with
a
childish
look
of
reproach
o
mamma
farley
i
know
laurie
will
say
some
terrible
thing
again
she
wrung
her
hands
that
were
plump
through
the
palm
and
had
tapering
fingers
which
curved
backward
at
the
tips
i
have
been
lying
here
all
afternoon
worrying
about
what
may
happen
tomorrow
as
she
spoke
she
glanced
beyond
her
head
to
the
heavily
beveled
mirror
in
the
old
bureau
and
her
rapt
tragic
face
became
even
more
voluptuously
tragic
as
it
contemplated
itself
now
winnie
i
have
talked
to
laurence
and
he
realizes
perfectly
well
that
he
ca
say
what
he
thinks
to
your
father
he
will
let
bygones
be
bygones
just
like
the
rest
of
us
o
mamma
farley
you
do
know
laurie
and
he
hates
papa
and
mamma
so
and
he
has
no
mercy
on
me
sometimes
i
think
he
hates
me
too
farley
hair
hung
in
straight
wisps
below
the
edge
of
her
shiny
old
black
velvet
turban
which
was
tilted
askew
her
withered
face
became
harshly
kind
she
had
more
firmness
when
she
was
with
winnie
than
in
the
presence
of
other
people
you
must
remember
winnie
that
i
have
known
laurie
considerably
longer
than
you
have
pull
yourself
together
and
rest
and
do
worry
about
this
any
more
i
know
it
will
be
all
right
may
had
followed
her
grandmother
and
now
stood
awkwardly
and
apologetically
on
one
foot
watching
the
two
women
when
her
mother
glanced
at
her
her
face
quivered
a
little
she
looked
at
the
floor
and
rubbed
the
scaled
toe
of
her
slipper
against
the
raveled
blue
nap
of
the
carpet
i
am
going
to
make
a
cake
today
farley
sighed
as
she
turned
toward
the
door
there
my
usual
saturday
baking
too
you
better
keep
still
so
you
wo
be
feeling
worse
tomorrow
if
i
get
through
in
time
tonight
i
going
to
press
your
yellow
dress
for
you
i
want
you
to
look
pretty
she
left
the
room
winnie
was
not
sure
that
she
wanted
to
look
pretty
she
was
a
little
ashamed
of
the
feeling
but
she
would
have
liked
to
create
with
her
parents
the
impression
that
the
farleys
had
not
treated
her
well
this
was
from
no
desire
to
injure
the
farleys
but
rather
from
an
intuition
as
to
what
kind
of
story
of
the
past
years
would
please
and
price
most
and
present
their
daughter
in
the
most
interesting
light
may
sidling
reluctantly
toward
the
hall
still
watched
her
mother
winnie
eyes
with
soft
hostile
possessiveness
fastened
themselves
on
her
little
girl
face
may
would
have
preferred
not
to
meet
her
mother
eyes
so
straight
come
here
may
winnie
sank
suddenly
to
her
knees
and
held
out
her
arms
may
walked
forward
seeming
not
able
to
stop
herself
you
love
mamma
anyway
do
you
yes
may
said
there
were
bubbles
of
saliva
on
her
lips
because
she
would
not
take
her
finger
away
from
her
mouth
do
think
i
selfish
may
winnie
shook
may
a
little
then
held
the
child
to
her
a
shudder
ran
like
a
live
uncontrolled
thing
between
them
may
was
ashamed
of
the
shudder
as
if
it
had
been
her
fault
winnie
drew
away
and
stared
at
her
daughter
winnie
eyes
were
soft
and
wistful
with
hurt
but
underneath
their
darkness
as
under
a
cloud
may
saw
something
she
was
afraid
of
it
was
angry
with
itself
and
demanded
that
she
give
it
something
she
did
not
know
what
to
give
it
to
escape
it
she
wanted
to
cry
winnie
wanted
to
make
may
cry
but
hated
her
for
crying
you
love
me
may
i
your
mamma
you
must
love
me
i
do
may
said
her
eyes
were
black
with
tears
but
because
she
wanted
to
cry
she
could
not
keep
her
lips
from
smiling
a
little
as
well
as
you
love
papa
may
felt
accused
of
something
she
could
not
make
herself
speak
she
was
sorry
and
wanted
her
mother
to
strike
her
then
you
love
papa
best
oh
may
that
cruel
you
must
love
him
best
winnie
excited
manner
was
contagious
may
did
not
know
how
to
explain
what
was
the
matter
and
suddenly
burst
into
tears
winnie
moved
back
again
and
watched
the
little
girl
with
her
arm
over
her
face
crying
may
sobs
lessened
without
knowing
what
had
occurred
she
felt
utterly
subjugated
she
wanted
to
love
her
mother
but
the
soft
angrily
caressing
eyes
would
not
let
her
when
would
her
mother
let
her
stop
crying
there
were
no
tears
any
more
it
was
hard
to
cry
without
tears
poor
naughty
mamma
does
know
what
she
done
may
with
her
eyes
shut
stole
out
a
hand
which
trembled
on
her
face
you
do
love
me
then
may
you
must
you
must
love
papa
best
i
do
they
kissed
may
saw
that
her
mother
eyes
were
like
things
standing
in
their
own
shadows
and
loving
themselves
they
liked
being
sad
they
yearned
over
may
face
but
it
was
as
if
they
did
not
see
it
and
were
yearning
for
themselves
go
play
with
bobby
then
dear
and
do
hurt
poor
mamma
like
that
i
wo
may
ran
out
and
left
winnie
looking
into
the
glass
beyond
where
the
child
had
been
winnie
could
not
understand
how
she
could
be
blamed
for
anything
she
was
so
innocent
so
childlike
at
one
time
laurence
had
been
able
to
discover
no
faults
in
her
she
recalled
the
early
months
of
their
marriage
and
remembered
that
in
those
days
whenever
she
had
reason
to
think
him
displeased
with
her
she
made
funny
little
pictures
of
herself
with
her
hands
over
her
eyes
and
signing
them
poor
winnie
left
them
under
his
plate
at
table
where
he
found
them
at
the
next
meal
a
pang
of
hatred
shot
through
her
mingled
with
the
recollection
of
caresses
involuntary
on
his
part
she
felt
a
need
for
justifying
her
increasing
hardness
of
heart
and
when
she
regarded
herself
sadly
in
the
mirror
she
was
reassured
it
was
as
if
in
the
way
her
tousled
reddish
curls
shot
back
the
light
there
was
something
that
contradicted
blame
it
was
four
through
the
window
the
sunshine
on
the
row
of
houses
opposite
paled
their
red
bricks
to
the
purplish
tint
of
old
rose
petals
at
the
end
of
the
street
where
the
square
began
bunches
of
raw
green
foliage
floated
with
a
heavy
stillness
above
the
smutty
roofs
steeped
in
light
behind
the
bright
leaves
the
blue
sky
melted
into
itself
as
into
its
own
dream
laurence
came
home
early
on
saturdays
and
winnie
decided
to
dress
as
she
opened
the
front
of
her
négligé
bobby
entered
the
room
and
made
her
hesitate
he
sweated
and
panted
dragging
his
feet
and
lugging
with
both
hands
a
small
tin
bucket
filled
with
the
dirt
he
had
dug
in
the
back
yard
he
was
very
fat
he
wore
overalls
and
there
was
dirt
smeared
in
the
creases
of
his
neck
under
his
firm
chin
bobby
how
can
you
dirt
nice
dirt
bobby
explained
everything
about
him
showed
that
he
belonged
to
himself
his
brown
eyes
were
passively
against
his
mother
grunting
laboriously
he
stooped
and
began
to
empty
the
rich
purplish
earth
on
the
blue
carpet
winnie
eyes
flashed
do
you
dare
do
that
bobby
she
sprang
toward
him
trying
to
be
angry
he
did
not
mind
he
kept
his
fat
shoulders
bent
to
his
task
stop
it
i
say
only
a
few
grains
of
the
damp
dark
soil
remained
in
the
bright
bucket
she
gripped
his
elbow
he
glanced
at
her
his
solemn
eyes
twinkling
with
a
kind
of
placid
malice
his
grasp
on
the
tin
handle
relaxed
and
he
sat
down
very
flat
on
his
plump
bottom
winnie
dropped
down
beside
him
and
began
to
laugh
she
could
not
have
said
why
but
she
always
felt
flattered
by
his
defiance
now
what
shall
i
do
she
demanded
they
stared
at
each
other
i
makin
a
house
bobby
said
there
were
still
harsh
lights
in
his
placid
eyes
they
made
her
ashamed
and
glad
that
she
was
his
mother
her
heart
beat
very
fast
and
escaping
from
an
emotion
which
perplexed
and
disturbed
her
she
threw
her
arms
about
him
and
buried
her
face
against
his
cool
ear
and
his
moist
cool
cheek
oh
you
love
me
you
love
me
i
know
you
love
me
she
crooned
rocking
him
against
her
you
love
me
as
well
as
you
do
papa
i
know
you
do
bobby
wriggled
do
love
papa
he
said
but
you
must
you
know
you
must
there
was
a
sob
in
winnie
voice
she
was
sick
she
said
to
herself
that
was
why
she
wanted
to
be
loved
love
papa
you
must
love
papa
but
love
mamma
too
oh
bobby
poor
mamma
bobby
tried
to
pull
away
again
but
she
had
felt
some
one
looking
at
them
and
she
would
not
let
him
go
bobby
breath
was
warm
on
her
half
bare
breast
she
turned
her
head
guilty
and
ready
to
cry
with
hatred
of
her
guilt
laurence
was
in
the
doorway
she
knew
he
had
hesitated
there
but
when
she
looked
at
him
he
walked
straight
forward
past
her
with
the
air
of
having
only
just
arrived
hello
he
said
glad
you
are
up
look
what
bobby
done
she
let
bobby
go
into
mischief
as
usual
eh
laurence
said
he
walked
to
the
wardrobe
and
hung
up
his
hat
he
had
a
short
bulky
figure
the
head
and
shoulders
too
big
for
the
rest
of
him
he
had
thick
brown
hair
coarse
and
very
slightly
sprinkled
with
gray
his
skin
was
ruddy
but
did
not
look
fresh
as
he
walked
with
his
swaying
awkward
stride
he
held
his
head
forward
and
a
little
to
one
side
his
coat
sagged
on
the
hips
and
was
caught
up
toward
the
back
seam
his
hands
did
not
appear
to
belong
to
him
they
were
short
disproportionately
small
and
very
delicate
bobby
you
should
be
made
to
clean
up
winnie
said
laurence
came
over
and
looked
at
the
pile
of
dirt
may
was
all
bobby
said
he
wanted
to
get
away
from
his
father
he
ran
out
he
made
a
mess
all
right
can
i
help
you
up
laurence
leaned
to
her
and
she
gave
him
her
weak
hands
she
wanted
him
to
feel
them
weak
in
his
his
mouth
twitched
a
little
as
he
pulled
her
to
her
feet
she
hated
the
furtive
bitterness
that
was
in
all
he
did
for
her
yet
it
struck
a
fire
from
her
she
leaned
against
him
she
was
frail
and
plaintive
he
seemed
to
stiffen
against
her
softness
she
loved
herself
wistfully
her
eyes
lifted
to
his
face
to
marry
her
he
had
given
up
the
prospect
of
a
career
in
science
an
expedition
to
africa
with
one
of
his
old
professors
had
been
abandoned
at
that
time
he
had
finished
college
and
was
working
for
a
scientific
degree
she
was
eighteen
winnie
felt
herself
still
to
be
good
pretty
and
sweet
she
had
a
right
to
something
beside
this
distant
tenderness
she
knew
there
had
been
times
when
simply
a
look
a
glance
a
word
from
her
had
carried
him
off
his
feet
after
these
occasions
there
were
symptoms
of
on
his
part
yet
he
was
proud
of
her
she
was
certain
often
without
his
being
aware
of
it
she
had
seen
him
betray
to
others
a
secret
vanity
in
possessing
her
surely
it
was
no
disgrace
to
yield
to
her
she
had
sometimes
caught
him
staring
at
her
abstractedly
yet
with
such
unyielding
curiosity
that
it
made
her
shiver
to
remember
it
she
clung
to
him
so
that
he
could
not
look
at
her
like
that
now
do
you
feel
well
enough
to
dress
for
dinner
laurence
asked
yes
laurie
i
feel
all
right
if
if
what
he
was
always
harsh
when
he
joked
she
twisted
the
button
of
his
coat
his
eyes
narrowed
against
hers
as
though
he
were
shutting
her
out
his
sweet
harsh
lips
smiled
he
gave
her
a
kiss
and
moved
out
of
her
arms
going
to
the
window
she
was
ill
the
doctor
had
advised
another
operation
without
it
she
could
have
no
more
children
she
would
die
she
looked
at
laurence
he
hurt
her
the
line
of
his
back
against
her
forced
her
into
herself
it
was
a
pain
but
when
she
remembered
what
a
serious
state
of
health
she
was
in
most
of
her
bitterness
passed
away
from
her
an
expression
of
sweetness
and
resignation
came
into
her
face
her
eyes
shone
in
tears
under
her
reddish
disheveled
hair
in
her
illness
she
felt
superior
to
her
husband
and
was
able
to
love
herself
more
completely
i
heard
from
mamma
today
again
laurence
she
began
gently
yes
laurence
had
hesitated
before
replying
she
wanted
him
to
turn
round
he
kept
his
gaze
fixed
on
the
street
beyond
the
open
window
a
soft
current
of
motion
stirred
the
bright
heavy
air
blue
with
whirling
motes
she
could
see
his
hair
slowly
lifted
past
his
head
the
sky
was
pale
with
light
the
sunshine
floated
from
the
dim
quivering
sky
she
kept
watching
his
shoulders
in
the
sagging
coat
i
believe
you
had
rather
see
me
miserable
all
the
rest
of
my
life
oh
laurence
how
can
you
i
ca
hurt
mamma
any
longer
even
to
please
you
to
please
me
laurence
voice
was
sharp
and
sarcastic
yet
it
did
not
reproach
she
hated
its
tolerance
of
course
i
know
i
ca
please
you
she
said
she
could
not
see
his
face
and
it
was
almost
unbearable
not
to
know
whether
he
was
smiling
or
not
she
felt
him
going
farther
away
from
her
because
of
her
mother
it
was
cruel
now
whenever
he
did
not
want
to
touch
her
he
said
she
was
sick
she
hugged
her
sickness
but
she
hated
him
for
talking
about
it
now
winnie
he
was
facing
her
i
tried
to
efface
myself
as
much
as
possible
as
regards
your
parents
if
you
were
nervous
and
ill
you
would
realize
that
the
time
has
passed
for
reproaching
me
forgive
me
there
nothing
to
forgive
she
was
irritated
because
he
would
not
forgive
her
but
she
went
to
him
and
laid
her
head
against
his
coat
a
tremor
shot
through
him
when
she
touched
him
and
she
did
not
know
whether
she
was
agitating
him
in
a
manner
complimentary
to
herself
or
not
but
something
in
her
hardened
he
had
no
right
to
conceal
himself
oh
laurie
they
were
still
against
each
other
she
felt
him
waiting
for
her
to
lift
her
head
when
people
married
they
became
one
she
was
conscious
of
feeling
cruel
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
nothing
to
reproach
herself
with
i
cut
myself
on
my
manicure
scissors
today
you
must
be
stern
with
me
he
could
not
help
thinking
what
a
common
little
hand
she
had
he
was
sorry
for
her
what
a
tragedy
his
lips
rested
on
the
finger
an
instant
without
giving
themselves
they
quivered
a
little
an
emotion
that
was
unpleasant
and
at
the
same
time
exhilarating
swept
through
her
and
seemed
to
lift
her
from
her
feet
she
thought
sadly
and
complacently
of
how
much
she
had
suffered
for
him
already
where
is
may
laurence
asked
suddenly
he
felt
that
in
kissing
winnie
finger
he
had
committed
himself
to
some
unknown
almost
sinister
thing
he
resented
the
stupidity
of
his
thought
downstairs
i
suppose
when
he
talked
of
may
winnie
was
glad
to
leave
him
she
felt
as
if
he
were
lying
to
her
laurence
moved
toward
the
door
his
gross
body
large
in
the
darkening
room
winnie
seemed
to
know
each
detail
of
him
as
he
passed
into
the
dark
hall
it
was
painful
to
know
him
so
distinctly
she
tried
in
vain
to
revive
the
blurred
apperception
of
him
which
she
had
had
in
earlier
days
she
wanted
people
to
see
him
as
she
had
seen
him
then
his
rocking
walk
humiliated
her
and
when
visitors
were
present
she
tried
to
inveigle
him
into
sitting
in
an
armchair
where
his
heavy
handsome
profile
would
be
silhouetted
against
the
light
his
awkward
body
at
rest
i
do
think
it
is
right
for
him
to
show
an
exaggerated
preference
for
one
child
she
told
herself
he
does
love
may
he
exaggerates
his
feeling
for
her
out
of
pique
winnie
could
not
forgive
him
for
being
kinder
to
may
than
she
was
she
found
a
match
among
the
shadows
the
invisible
sun
made
patches
of
bronze
light
in
the
dark
the
match
flared
like
a
long
soft
wound
of
flame
the
gas
rushed
out
of
the
jet
with
a
thick
hiss
and
the
flame
spread
into
a
fan
it
was
a
wing
covered
with
yellow
down
blue
at
the
quill
the
wind
sucked
at
it
soundlessly
she
walked
to
the
window
which
the
gas
flame
had
already
made
dark
the
sky
was
bunches
of
black
leaves
on
the
trees
in
the
square
cut
the
dim
fiery
horizon
into
twinkling
segments
a
telegraph
pole
rose
up
like
a
finger
higher
than
the
houses
and
appeared
to
lean
heavily
against
the
quiet
beyond
behind
flecks
of
cloud
putrescent
stars
shone
as
through
flecks
of
foam
on
an
enchanted
sea
winnie
pressed
her
head
against
the
cold
pane
laurence
herself
old
age
she
would
never
be
happy
a
peaceful
vanity
took
the
place
of
her
unrest
she
realized
an
ethereal
quality
in
herself
which
coincided
with
the
whiteness
of
her
little
hands
she
was
aware
of
her
hands
delicate
and
precious
against
her
breast
her
breathing
tightened
she
did
not
want
to
remember
the
ugliness
of
the
long
illness
she
had
had
and
to
think
of
the
operation
which
threatened
her
threw
her
into
a
panic
when
people
talked
too
much
to
her
of
death
she
only
saw
something
ugly
which
she
did
not
understand
she
wanted
to
get
away
from
it
she
felt
that
she
should
not
be
forced
to
think
of
death
it
did
not
belong
to
her
if
people
only
loved
her
and
allowed
her
to
be
herself
she
gave
everything
she
turned
away
from
the
window
and
walked
back
to
the
mirror
alice
was
the
last
to
reach
home
for
dinner
she
closed
the
front
door
briskly
after
her
its
thud
was
muffled
and
at
the
same
time
emphasized
by
the
quiet
of
the
empty
street
behind
it
she
whistled
as
she
took
off
her
hat
the
tramp
of
her
feet
toward
the
was
like
a
man
hello
mamma
farley
hello
laurie
glad
to
see
you
down
winnie
she
tweaked
bobby
ear
hello
aunt
alice
his
voice
was
thick
like
a
small
amused
buddha
he
looked
at
her
may
thought
aunt
alice
was
not
going
to
notice
her
but
aunt
alice
patted
the
little
girl
head
may
was
terrified
and
relieved
when
the
big
hand
brushed
her
hair
heavily
she
smiled
at
aunt
alice
but
aunt
alice
did
not
see
her
then
her
face
grew
stupid
with
perplexity
again
and
her
eyes
were
like
two
dark
bright
empty
things
and
under
her
frilled
apron
though
she
tried
to
hold
her
chest
in
tight
you
could
see
her
heart
beat
farley
who
had
been
upstairs
was
the
last
to
enter
the
when
alice
saw
him
her
homely
rugged
face
lit
with
peremptory
condescending
affection
and
she
said
come
and
sit
by
me
this
minute
papa
farley
your
soup
is
cold
what
do
you
mean
by
being
so
late
farley
was
always
embarrassed
by
alice
officious
regard
but
he
would
not
permit
himself
to
become
impatient
he
was
a
large
handsome
man
ten
years
younger
than
his
wife
his
hair
was
prematurely
white
there
were
heavy
lines
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
one
deep
fold
between
his
brows
but
otherwise
his
face
was
smooth
and
fresh
his
lips
were
compressed
continually
into
a
smile
he
veiled
his
disconcerted
rather
empty
blue
eyes
under
defensively
lowered
lids
he
gave
a
quick
glance
around
the
brightly
lit
table
winnie
improving
that
good
yes
you
look
better
alice
observed
to
her
winnie
made
a
little
moue
as
she
met
the
cheerful
but
accurate
scrutiny
of
eyes
winnie
felt
aggrieved
by
this
clearness
of
gaze
in
resenting
it
she
pitied
alice
who
had
coarse
sallow
skin
and
large
hands
and
feet
winnie
has
every
reason
to
be
better
her
father
and
mother
are
coming
to
dinner
with
us
farley
conversation
was
always
studiedly
general
her
voice
was
weak
and
toneless
and
a
little
harsh
but
she
spoke
carefully
with
an
agreeable
intonation
while
she
talked
her
stubby
uncertain
hand
grasped
the
hilt
of
a
long
knife
and
the
thin
flashing
blade
sunk
into
the
brown
crusted
beefsteak
so
that
the
beautiful
blood
spurted
from
the
soft
pink
inner
flesh
and
mingled
with
the
grease
that
was
cooling
and
coating
the
bottom
of
the
dish
she
laid
fat
pieces
of
pink
meat
on
the
successive
plates
which
she
removed
from
a
cracked
white
pile
before
her
the
boiled
potatoes
were
overdone
and
burst
apart
when
she
tried
to
serve
them
on
the
thin
yellow
skin
which
hardened
over
their
mealy
insides
there
were
spots
i
glad
winnie
we
all
glad
no
grievance
is
worth
hugging
like
this
farley
held
his
hand
to
his
eyes
but
he
spoke
determinedly
they
all
knew
how
hard
it
must
be
for
him
to
accede
to
a
meeting
with
price
laurence
alice
and
winnie
thought
of
the
unkind
things
which
price
had
said
about
their
family
scandal
at
the
time
of
the
break
and
wondered
if
he
would
refer
to
it
again
farley
liked
to
do
hard
things
if
his
resolution
hurt
him
he
kept
it
and
was
not
afraid
of
it
he
was
comfortable
in
the
bare
cheaply
furnished
because
he
felt
that
if
he
had
desired
happiness
he
might
not
have
been
there
and
as
he
was
very
punctilious
in
his
duties
toward
his
wife
he
was
able
to
relieve
the
oppressive
sense
of
sin
which
he
had
carried
with
him
during
most
of
his
life
winnie
and
alice
were
both
watching
laurence
his
face
was
bitterly
impassive
on
a
former
occasion
he
had
insulted
price
his
present
resignation
was
full
of
disgust
winnie
felt
that
he
was
giving
her
to
her
mother
you
not
eating
dear
i
let
the
children
stay
up
because
you
were
feeling
better
i
thought
we
would
celebrate
farley
eyelashes
were
whitish
she
carried
nose
glasses
fastened
to
a
gold
hook
on
the
breast
of
the
black
waist
she
had
washed
herself
and
ironed
so
badly
she
squinted
when
she
smiled
yet
her
eyes
did
not
look
glad
but
tired
i
trying
mamma
farley
winnie
sweet
mouth
was
tremulous
she
was
glad
to
feel
it
tremulous
how
could
laurence
give
her
over
simply
because
her
heart
would
not
let
her
refuse
her
mother
any
longer
alice
cut
her
beefsteak
with
brisk
emphatic
strokes
she
took
big
bites
and
chewed
them
with
an
air
of
exaggerated
relish
she
felt
herself
to
be
the
one
person
in
the
world
who
understood
laurence
but
she
knew
that
he
feared
and
resented
her
understanding
he
had
always
been
saturnine
and
had
lived
his
life
alone
at
college
he
paid
his
own
way
until
he
won
a
medal
which
entitled
him
to
a
scholarship
after
this
he
devoted
himself
to
research
work
in
biology
alice
imagination
had
never
quite
encompassed
his
impulse
in
marrying
winnie
and
it
was
still
more
difficult
to
understand
why
winnie
had
committed
herself
even
in
the
days
of
courtship
winnie
had
often
fled
in
tears
from
her
lover
she
was
ashamed
of
his
deliberated
vulgarities
though
they
piqued
and
invited
her
alice
could
not
comprehend
it
winnie
and
laurence
had
been
secretly
married
when
the
prices
commanded
their
daughter
to
leave
her
husband
laurence
had
withdrawn
from
the
decision
and
told
her
to
do
as
she
liked
she
had
not
been
able
to
make
herself
leave
him
she
did
not
know
that
she
wanted
to
her
parents
had
cut
her
off
ten
months
later
may
was
born
laurence
took
his
scientific
knowledge
to
the
laboratory
of
a
manufacturer
of
serums
and
began
to
make
a
living
i
used
up
most
of
your
five
dollars
on
some
hens
today
alice
farley
conscience
was
heavy
with
the
sudden
silence
at
the
table
it
merged
into
her
own
inner
silence
and
became
the
voice
of
herself
from
which
she
was
anxious
to
escape
good
you
work
so
hard
mamma
farley
do
winnie
not
wanting
mamma
farley
to
work
felt
sad
and
nice
again
and
justified
before
laurence
i
used
to
it
farley
mouth
puckered
in
a
prim
tired
smile
the
mouth
was
satisfied
with
itself
so
it
drew
up
like
that
do
deprive
mamma
of
the
joy
of
martyrdom
winnie
alice
insisted
laughing
shortly
farley
kept
her
withered
lips
smiling
but
her
eyes
dull
and
confused
with
resentment
felt
covertly
and
bitterly
for
her
daughter
face
alice
ate
oblivious
farley
with
physical
irritation
felt
alice
eating
beefsteak
and
swallowing
it
half
chewed
you
leave
mother
alone
alice
expend
your
benevolent
energies
somewhere
else
laurence
his
lip
twitching
with
repression
stared
hard
and
smiling
into
alice
eyes
her
eyes
were
a
sad
brown
a
little
dull
they
were
quiet
eyes
staring
back
unreproachfully
as
though
they
understood
the
pain
of
his
laurence
had
a
constant
unreasoning
impulse
to
defy
alice
thanks
alice
answered
with
tired
sarcasm
i
do
need
any
one
to
look
after
me
laurence
farley
said
her
voice
cheerful
her
mouth
wry
and
tight
her
lids
drooped
farley
was
restless
your
mother
is
right
we
must
give
and
price
a
royal
welcome
tomorrow
we
must
put
ourselves
in
their
place
there
are
two
sides
to
everything
and
it
takes
a
great
deal
of
determination
to
make
the
first
overture
they
done
that
now
it
up
to
us
farley
was
always
afraid
that
the
incipient
quarrel
between
alice
and
her
mother
would
develop
plainer
proportions
he
did
not
see
the
group
about
him
clearly
but
a
helpless
smile
was
on
his
face
in
terror
of
their
unkindliness
he
showed
them
how
noble
he
was
there
was
another
silence
farley
could
not
bear
it
has
ridge
decided
when
he
will
leave
for
europe
alice
farley
knife
and
fork
in
her
weak
hands
clattered
against
her
plate
alice
was
silent
a
moment
he
wo
leave
before
next
month
she
said
she
was
very
intent
on
her
food
a
flush
went
across
her
forehead
like
a
burn
half
under
her
stringy
brown
hair
laurence
gave
her
a
quick
glance
of
involuntary
inquiry
winnie
stared
at
her
with
soft
sharpness
does
the
doctor
think
his
eyes
will
get
well
farley
asked
too
clouded
with
his
own
concerns
to
be
aware
of
the
tension
in
face
he
hopes
so
it
is
nervous
strain
and
overwork
mostly
there
was
some
sort
of
infection
but
that
came
as
a
result
then
you
have
a
vacation
he
ca
take
you
to
europe
no
alice
said
almost
angrily
i
know
where
i
can
get
green
things
cheap
mamma
that
market
on
smith
street
i
see
where
ridge
has
been
attacked
by
all
his
radical
friends
he
seems
to
have
most
of
the
world
down
on
him
for
that
last
book
alice
would
not
see
laurence
sneer
he
too
good
for
all
of
them
she
said
sharply
winnie
pursed
her
mouth
it
was
an
effort
not
to
laugh
to
see
alice
show
feeling
for
a
man
like
ridge
made
one
hysterical
farley
was
not
thinking
of
alice
or
of
horace
ridge
again
and
again
as
if
in
spite
of
himself
he
allowed
his
gaze
to
rest
on
winnie
his
disturbed
him
and
if
he
could
avoid
it
he
never
looked
her
in
the
eye
if
he
could
keep
from
noticing
the
throats
and
breasts
and
arms
of
women
he
was
usually
all
right
then
if
he
were
obliged
to
see
them
clearly
he
wanted
to
weep
with
the
pain
of
it
and
when
tears
again
blurred
his
vision
he
was
relieved
marriage
had
been
a
failure
there
had
been
he
felt
terrible
things
in
his
life
sex
had
invariably
placed
him
in
the
wrong
so
sex
must
be
the
expression
of
a
perverse
impulse
tainted
as
he
considered
it
like
other
men
he
struggled
to
exalt
himself
into
a
vagueness
in
which
particular
women
did
not
exist
winnie
despised
him
but
she
would
not
admit
it
to
herself
i
so
glad
to
see
you
better
so
glad
farley
repeated
irrelevantly
uncomfortable
because
he
felt
the
sweetness
of
face
too
intimately
thank
you
dear
papa
farley
winnie
laid
her
hand
gently
on
his
big
fist
resting
on
the
table
he
withdrew
his
fingers
but
as
he
did
so
gave
her
hand
an
apologetic
pat
her
little
fingers
felt
to
her
like
iron
under
his
big
soft
hand
she
knew
he
was
afraid
when
she
touched
him
vulgar
old
man
she
said
to
herself
she
despised
him
so
that
she
wanted
to
touch
him
again
out
of
her
superiority
dear
papa
farley
there
was
helpless
moisture
in
his
eyes
which
he
could
not
keep
from
her
i
have
some
work
today
i
forego
dessert
alice
got
up
with
sudden
awkwardness
and
pushed
her
chair
back
she
smiled
at
them
all
not
seeing
them
when
she
had
gone
they
were
pleased
and
yet
ashamed
of
themselves
knowing
why
she
went
did
you
get
your
deal
through
father
laurence
asked
impatiently
after
a
moment
they
were
all
relieved
of
the
silence
too
heavy
with
alice
the
window
was
open
and
the
thick
dark
night
coming
warm
and
moist
into
the
bedroom
made
alice
feel
as
though
some
one
breathed
into
her
face
close
against
her
stifling
her
the
yellow
gas
flame
rushed
up
from
the
jet
with
a
stealthy
noise
the
street
outside
was
still
alice
sat
down
before
her
typewriter
and
stared
at
it
suddenly
her
full
breasts
heaved
oh
my
god
she
buried
her
face
her
blouse
pulled
tight
across
her
shoulders
as
she
stretched
her
arms
in
front
of
her
horace
ridge
was
going
to
europe
to
remain
two
years
he
might
get
well
he
might
die
his
eyes
she
felt
herself
lost
in
the
darkness
of
his
eyes
then
something
broke
in
her
i
tell
him
i
go
with
him
she
dared
not
see
herself
in
the
glass
opposite
once
she
had
abandoned
herself
to
her
desire
to
be
beautiful
she
remembered
with
a
horrible
sense
of
humiliation
the
hours
spent
behind
locked
doors
when
she
had
tried
to
make
herself
into
something
men
would
like
one
day
she
had
done
her
hair
a
new
way
and
going
into
the
had
caught
laurence
ridiculing
eyes
upon
her
that
was
before
he
married
winnie
alice
realized
that
something
had
gone
wild
in
her
she
had
picked
a
paper
knife
from
a
table
and
hurled
it
at
him
and
it
had
cut
his
hand
his
face
had
turned
scarlet
then
white
then
scarlet
again
he
had
gone
out
as
if
he
were
glad
without
speaking
to
her
after
that
she
fixed
her
hair
the
old
way
and
avoided
the
mirror
she
did
not
want
to
realize
what
she
was
nothing
existed
but
work
when
she
met
a
pretty
woman
in
the
streets
alice
had
a
sense
of
outrage
a
flame
burnt
in
her
then
she
tried
to
be
patient
and
it
grew
cool
she
wore
heavy
careless
clothing
she
was
generous
to
winnie
most
of
all
it
relieved
alice
to
buy
presents
for
the
children
it
was
the
evening
before
when
she
came
home
from
work
that
bobby
met
her
in
the
hall
then
there
was
jam
on
his
unperturbed
face
you
donna
bring
me
sumpin
he
reminded
her
she
held
out
a
top
for
an
instant
a
cold
gleam
of
possession
lit
bobby
still
eyes
in
his
fat
face
he
grasped
the
top
and
moved
a
little
away
from
her
his
air
was
suspicious
when
he
was
sure
the
top
was
his
the
cold
light
died
from
his
face
he
was
smooth
and
shut
into
himself
again
he
was
like
a
china
baby
to
get
at
his
soul
one
needed
to
break
him
you
like
it
eh
alice
demanded
her
eyes
were
more
violently
hard
than
his
she
seemed
to
like
him
against
her
will
she
bent
down
his
lips
brushed
her
cheek
dutifully
and
she
felt
as
though
a
mark
had
been
left
there
she
imagined
it
a
spot
like
frost
with
five
points
like
a
leaf
tan
i
go
as
he
went
away
from
her
the
spot
burned
her
inexorably
bobby
descended
to
the
back
yard
he
seemed
to
know
how
futile
a
thing
alice
was
compared
to
himself
with
her
face
buried
on
the
oilcloth
cover
of
the
typewriter
thoughts
all
confused
ran
on
god
art
suggestions
that
had
come
to
her
as
horace
ridge
dictated
his
book
then
in
the
turmoil
she
could
see
horace
ridge
big
figure
still
against
the
light
of
the
window
where
he
worked
alice
felt
herself
light
clear
and
vacuous
absorbed
in
the
substantiality
of
this
picture
christ
died
on
a
cross
she
felt
sick
as
with
disgust
good
to
others
hate
winnie
alice
could
not
bear
to
think
of
the
children
born
of
winnie
bobby
born
of
winnie
she
could
not
think
of
him
virgin
mary
there
seemed
something
secret
and
awful
in
maternity
some
desecration
she
felt
the
child
helplessly
intimate
with
the
mother
body
he
did
not
want
her
other
religions
no
time
to
read
up
buddha
sex
marriage
laurie
was
an
atheist
he
wanted
to
be
perverse
must
be
something
nice
pictures
art
beauty
when
she
said
beauty
to
herself
her
heart
was
hard
with
resentment
men
rot
they
did
not
understand
she
cried
a
few
moments
thinking
of
nothing
but
it
was
as
if
something
unseen
grew
strong
with
her
weakness
it
drank
her
misery
and
left
her
dry
she
got
up
feverish
and
stood
before
the
glass
hating
herself
her
waist
had
pulled
apart
in
front
and
she
saw
the
swell
of
her
big
firm
breast
her
face
was
heavy
and
ugly
with
rebellion
sallow
the
eyes
inflamed
she
saw
her
breast
strange
shiver
of
curiosity
about
herself
why
did
it
hurt
her
to
see
her
breast
she
covered
it
up
she
looked
at
herself
into
her
hot
eyes
something
cried
inside
her
for
mercy
but
she
would
not
take
her
hot
angry
eyes
from
the
face
in
the
glass
no
use
to
beat
about
the
bush
and
pretend
to
be
highfalutin
wanted
what
winnie
wanted
disliked
winnie
she
had
a
corroding
sensation
in
her
throat
as
though
she
tasted
metal
then
shame
mounted
hot
over
her
as
though
it
were
swallowing
her
she
resisted
being
swallowed
her
skin
quivered
against
the
hot
cold
engulfing
sense
of
degradation
she
was
like
a
bird
alive
in
a
snake
body
something
tightened
in
her
soul
and
the
emotion
she
had
experienced
the
moment
before
flowed
away
from
her
receding
it
left
a
hardened
accretion
like
petrifying
lava
flowing
down
cold
from
a
volcanic
crater
still
she
stared
at
herself
homely
woman
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
veins
crept
like
snakes
along
her
arms
life
stealing
upon
one
through
the
veins
stealthy
life
running
red
and
silent
in
its
bitterness
through
the
body
where
to
go
to
horace
ridge
he
has
any
woman
he
wants
famous
man
me
she
felt
slightly
intoxicated
by
a
frank
acknowledgment
of
her
absurdity
her
horror
of
herself
crept
over
her
body
shameful
because
of
no
use
i
ca
endure
it
her
wrist
pressed
against
her
teeth
and
made
a
mark
but
no
blood
came
she
wanted
to
tear
away
her
flesh
but
it
seemed
to
resist
her
it
was
full
of
hurt
where
her
teeth
had
pressed
life
sucked
at
her
like
a
wild
beast
she
turned
from
the
mirror
and
hurled
herself
face
downward
sobbing
on
the
bed
her
body
oppressed
her
she
cried
a
long
time
the
work
would
have
to
go
at
last
she
crept
off
the
bed
and
undressed
herself
and
put
out
the
light
but
she
lay
awake
and
the
darkness
remained
electric
and
horrible
she
closed
her
eyes
and
tried
to
shut
out
its
intimacy
mamma
and
papa
farley
what
was
wrong
between
them
sex
horror
she
tried
to
keep
her
thoughts
from
integrating
child
she
bit
her
wrist
again
and
turned
over
in
bed
too
proud
to
hate
winnie
other
girls
their
faces
opened
against
hers
they
were
white
and
flowering
in
the
dark
eyes
open
waiting
to
receive
men
she
shivered
one
must
think
about
these
things
winnie
maternity
bobby
seemed
slimed
all
over
with
winnie
to
wash
bobby
clean
clean
of
winnie
alice
was
still
awhile
she
was
dark
inside
but
the
dark
grew
calm
she
began
to
go
over
things
very
clearly
what
was
passion
fourteen
years
old
pain
words
written
on
back
fences
i
am
glad
to
be
out
of
it
poor
little
winnie
outside
cool
cool
ache
of
being
outside
life
horace
ridge
settled
form
quiet
against
the
dancing
window
he
turned
in
his
chair
kind
eyes
behind
glasses
he
could
keep
people
outside
him
because
he
had
all
they
could
give
him
already
there
behind
brown
agate
eyes
albert
price
short
trousers
face
like
a
girl
they
knew
she
years
old
outside
their
lives
she
did
not
want
her
body
if
she
could
only
make
horace
ridge
understand
that
she
had
no
body
clothes
made
her
virgin
when
she
was
a
mother
if
she
could
undress
herself
he
would
know
that
she
was
a
mother
clothes
made
him
years
old
radical
critic
of
life
and
manners
ruined
health
blindness
incipient
she
wanted
to
undress
him
to
show
him
how
little
he
was
oh
dear
she
cried
it
hurt
but
less
oh
dear
life
was
a
muddle
when
one
ceased
to
desire
there
was
quiet
bitter
and
beautiful
quiet
laurence
winnie
mamma
and
papa
far
away
from
her
pathetic
with
distance
horace
ridge
far
away
from
her
her
loving
him
cool
nothing
she
wanted
nothing
heart
in
the
breast
coolly
melted
like
water
in
a
still
cup
in
the
bed
in
the
darkness
her
still
heart
reflected
the
shadows
of
hot
summer
pavements
brick
houses
with
fronts
beaten
flat
and
dull
by
sun
the
moment
before
nightfall
when
lights
burst
from
the
theater
fronts
and
the
streets
were
gay
with
people
in
pale
colored
clothes
then
the
heart
was
still
was
cool
was
water
into
which
the
darkness
came
gratefully
covering
the
loneliness
alice
was
sorry
for
herself
because
she
had
a
mother
like
farley
poor
papa
farley
alice
loved
him
and
despised
him
she
did
not
love
her
mother
on
sunday
when
alice
went
downstairs
farley
had
on
her
gray
taffeta
dress
and
was
intent
on
setting
the
house
right
she
walked
stooped
a
little
forward
her
shoulders
drawn
together
the
eyeglasses
that
hung
on
her
chest
twinkled
short
straight
soft
hairs
floated
unpinned
at
the
nape
of
her
neck
when
she
turned
her
head
the
withered
skin
made
fine
swirls
of
wrinkles
about
her
throat
she
walked
very
fast
about
the
parlor
putting
the
chairs
in
place
she
took
short
steps
so
that
her
haste
appeared
feverish
the
occasion
seemed
to
fill
her
with
a
kind
of
worried
happiness
farley
had
put
on
his
frock
coat
he
had
no
dignity
in
it
do
work
too
hard
mother
he
went
into
the
smiling
in
bland
anticipation
of
whomever
should
be
there
alice
was
at
table
she
was
ashamed
of
her
red
eyes
and
barely
glanced
up
what
would
mamma
do
if
we
forgot
for
one
day
to
object
to
her
working
so
hard
farley
spread
his
and
sat
down
on
the
oak
chair
with
the
imitation
leather
seat
alice
remarks
about
her
mother
made
him
feel
guilty
we
should
have
gotten
up
earlier
so
your
mother
would
have
the
dishes
to
worry
about
i
going
to
wash
alice
said
shortly
it
was
a
hot
day
the
clouded
sky
was
a
colorless
glare
a
thick
wind
stirred
the
ragged
awnings
upstairs
before
the
bedroom
windows
for
a
moment
the
sun
came
out
as
though
an
eye
had
opened
the
house
fronts
were
a
pale
bright
pink
dust
made
little
eddies
in
the
empty
sunday
street
the
awnings
lifted
then
hung
inert
like
broken
wings
when
a
wagon
passed
you
could
hear
above
the
rattle
of
the
wheels
the
muffled
thud
of
the
horse
feet
striking
the
soft
asphalt
may
was
on
the
front
steps
she
wore
a
very
stiffly
starched
white
dress
and
a
pink
sash
wilted
and
wrinkled
by
many
tyings
her
hair
was
brushed
back
very
smooth
and
gathered
away
from
her
forehead
with
a
flapping
bow
pale
with
interest
her
small
face
turned
toward
the
corner
of
the
square
as
she
watched
for
the
prices
to
come
in
the
parlor
winnie
stood
out
of
sight
behind
the
freshly
laundered
curtains
and
watched
too
laurence
had
left
the
house
she
wondered
if
he
were
going
to
avoid
her
parents
as
the
time
passed
the
sun
disappeared
again
and
shadows
flowed
into
the
street
which
was
as
gray
and
still
as
water
when
the
equipage
with
shining
lacquered
sides
flashed
into
the
empty
place
may
looked
at
it
bewildered
but
winnie
had
seen
it
through
the
window
and
recognized
her
parents
the
carriage
drew
up
before
the
house
and
the
wheels
scraping
the
curb
made
a
long
rasping
sound
the
chestnut
horses
were
fat
their
harness
twinkled
they
wriggled
the
stumps
of
their
clipped
tails
against
the
cruppers
that
constrained
them
on
their
breasts
where
the
circingles
had
rubbed
and
on
their
flanks
and
buttocks
the
hair
was
darkened
and
matted
with
lather
may
was
afraid
and
proud
because
the
beautiful
horses
stood
before
her
home
they
stamped
a
shiver
ran
along
their
satin
bellies
their
breasts
and
forelegs
quivered
with
tension
as
they
jerked
their
heads
in
the
check
reins
and
pressed
the
street
with
harsh
hoofs
below
their
rigid
ankles
watching
them
may
uttered
a
little
cry
of
terror
and
delight
but
she
thought
some
one
had
heard
her
and
she
clapped
her
hand
over
her
mouth
the
footman
had
jumped
from
his
place
and
and
price
were
descending
from
the
carriage
indoors
winnie
felt
her
heart
swell
with
a
pain
of
pride
these
were
her
parents
all
these
years
she
had
been
robbed
of
this
oh
mamma
farley
they
come
they
come
i
thought
i
should
never
see
them
again
winnie
smooth
fingers
clutched
farley
stiff
nerveless
palm
what
shall
i
do
it
has
been
my
fault
has
it
mamma
farley
winnie
soft
relentless
gaze
clung
to
her
face
farley
nervously
desired
to
evade
winnie
made
her
feel
guilty
of
the
situation
with
which
she
had
nothing
to
do
now
dear
now
dear
we
wo
talk
about
who
to
blame

your
mother
have
written
the
note
she

she
intended
to
reproach
you
but
papa
and
laurence
has
come
back
yet
he
and
papa
will
quarrel
again

should
have
let
him
do
this
way
mamma
farley
oh
feel
my
hands
they
so
cold
her
eyes
large
and
dark
shone
with
a
languid
and
deliberate
excitement
she
wished
that
alice
were
in
the
room
to
see
her
wry
thoughts
of
laurence
resentment
in
winnie
mind
was
like
grit
in
something
that
otherwise
would
have
moved

what

i
do
mamma
farley

oh

ca
how

laurence
leave

farley
called
on
again
to
explain
laurence
made
some
meaningless
gestures
clasped
and
unclasped
her
hands
her
fingers
pressed
hard
as
they
intertwined
made
her
knuckles
glow
white
now
dear
now
dear

go
with
me

ca

it
if
papa

anything
to

farley
across
the
brightly
swept
parlor
carpet
and
into
the
hall

already
opened
the
front
door
and

stood
against
the
light
of
the
street
their
faces
in
shadow
behind
them
the
coachman
was
turning
the
carriage
away
the
footman

straight

very
white

was
a
labored
smile

his
beaver
hat
and
revealed
the
top
of
his
broad
flat
head
bald
and
bright
above
his
hard
eyes
which
were
like
cloudy
stones
of
pale
blue
his

thrust
sullenly
forward

under
his
thin
mustache
there
was
no
color

under
his
chin
where
he
had
not
shaved
clean
you
might
detect
his
beard
by
a
colorless
shining
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
and
hesitation

shook
mamma
they
lay
in

out
and
patted
her
father
arm
he
took
her
hand
she
kissed
him
not
wanting

made
her
think
of
herself
she
wanted
to
relax
in
joyous
agony
lifting
her
soft
strange
eyes
to
her
mother
winnie
was
double
knowing
as
before
a
mirror
how
she
looked
sweet
to
have
people
unkind
when
you
could
forgive
them
but
behind
everything
the
recollection
of
laurie
intruded
harshly
in
the
background
farley
stood
uneasily
and
may
afraid
to
enjoy
the
family
happiness
yet
unable
to
leave
hopped
from
one
foot
to
the
other
with
subdued
exclamations
her
face
alternately
blank
with
confusion
or
atremble
with
response

cry
winnie
dear
we
are
all
so
glad
mrs
farley
price
pushed
winnie
gently
aside
and
put
out
a
frail
hand
determined
though
it
shook
a
little
farley
fingers
were
clumsy
fumbling
for

in
a

fashion

emotion

before
him
wonderingly
no
one

all
stopped

kissed
her
may
knew
the
kiss
to
be
stale
dry
with
a
bitter
smell
and
was
ashamed
of
knowing
the
dry
bitter
kiss
drank
of
may
coolness
she
was
dumb
under
the
caress
of
the
sick
hand
the
parlor
was
clean
and
gloomy
sit
down

farley
said
i
we
she
was
trembling
all
over
she
wept
because
of
the
rightness
of
things
such
a
glare
she
tottered
to
the
shade
her
silk
dress
rustled
there
farley
we
all
right
an
experience
like
this
is
good
for
all
of
us
christ

taught
us
to
forgive
our
enemies
and
when
we
do
i
believe
we
never
have
cause
to
regret
it

down
awkwardly
and
coughed
severely
into
his
mustache
his
furtive
gaze
traveled
malignantly
about
the
shabby
room
d
price
mr
price
alice
walked
heavily
in
among
them
price
turned
around
disconcerted
their
hands
touched
alice
seemed
to
take
charge
of
things
price
suddenly
felt
weak
and
was
obliged
to
seat
herself
winnie
was
annoyed
she
went
up
to
alice
plaintively
oh

so
happy
alice
she
wept
alice
was
still
like
a
warm
rock
we
happy
to
see
you
happy
as

remained
gruff
and
unmoved
winnie
became
more
humble

hard
and

happiness

must
begin
to
take
better
care

pulled
winnie
to
her
winnie
eyes
rapacious
with
humility
were
lifted
again
farley
came
in
casting
a
rapid
glance
around
the
group
his
smile
was
patient
fear
made
him
tired
well
well
we
so
mrs
price
he
stopped
before
her
not
sure
that
she
would
shake
hands
with
him
she
gave
him
her
finger
tips
and
he
took
them
miserably
yes
i
sure
you
all
enjoy
seeing
winnie
happy
price
said
she
was
cold
and
kind
farley
knew
what
she
was
thinking
of
helen
out
in
kansas
city
they
had
spoken
of
the
old
scandal
in
objecting
to
winnie
marriage
mr
price
hello
farley
hello
price
got
up
reluctantly
his
hand
clasp
was
a
condescension
farley
had
given
his
hand
limply
his
mouth
bent
with
acceptance
his
smile
was
still
tolerant
but
a
little
bitter
and
he
did
not
look
up
winnie
comes
first
farley
time
to
disagree
about
other
things
later
i
hope

are
through

down
again
abruptly
i
so
happy
papa
farley
winnie
eyes

shuddered
trying
not
to
see
them
fearful
that
he
would
forget
to
smile
i
glad
you

dear
winnie
clapped
her
hands
and
turned
once
more
to
her
mother
bobby
you
have
seen
bobby
oh
he
the
dearest
he
upstairs
taking
a
nap
alice
stood
defiantly
in
the
center
of
the
gloomy
room
her
feet
apart
her
stout
hips
set
out
want
me
to
see
if
he
awake
suppose
we
all
go
out
and
leave
winnie
alone
with
her
parents
for
a
few
minutes
farley
suggested
her
voice
quavering
slightly
she
puckered
her
lips
and
frowned
smiling
about
her
at
the
group
when
she
stood
up
her
gray
taffeta
dress
settled
slowly
with
a
calm
sound
in
folds
about
her
the
hem
lay
out
on
the
carpet
she
had
a
scrap
of
yellow
lace
at
her
neck
and
above
it
in
her
withered
loose
skin
you
could
see
the
flutter
of
a
pulse
we
certainly
should
alice
said
why
that
very
nice
i
do
price
looked
around
uncertain
yes
yes
come
may
farley
took
may
small
cold
hand
moist
in
her
dry
one
alice
went
first
and
farley
shuffled
after
the
others
head
bent
smiling
not
sure
why
they
were
going
out
price
had
risen
with
her
husband
and
stood
sad
and
calm
watching
them
leave
life
had
wrung
her
but
she
had
grown
sure
in
compromise
there
was
dignity
in
her
sureness
well
said
price
shortly
i
do
see
that
husband
of
yours
about
winnie
started
tremulously
she
smiled
at
him
with
a
relaxed
mouth
papa
dear
i
know
she
gulped
still
smiling
yes
i
know
i
know
i
suppose
he
run
away
from
us
he
probably
be
in
later
wo
he
dear
price
transparent
smile
was
a
thin
shield
guarding
winnie
from
her
father
winnie
tried
to
speak
then
she
gave
way
and
flung
her
white
arms
about
her
mother
throat
oh
there
there
i
know
confound
him
said
price
very
savagely
biting
his
mustache
please
perry
oh
that
all
right
that
all
right
i
not
going
to
lose
my
temper
do
cry
winnie
sweet
winnie
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
that
whether
he
refused
to
meet
us
or
not
price
asked
oh
mother
papa
i
do
cry
winnie
it
all
right
your
father
has
resolved
to
overlook
things
and
if
he
can
bring
himself
to
do
that
about
what
has
already
happened
this
last
little
rudeness
certainly
wo
matter
but
he
said
he
he
would
come
he
did
eh
and
then
went
out
now
perry
please
replying
to
his
wife
pale
smile
price
coughed
ambiguously
you
need
never
be
afraid
of
your
father
conducting
himself
in
anything
but
a
generous
manner
winnie
i
wish
you
might
have
been
at
church
last
sunday
when
he
presented
the
new
organ
i
know
but
that
all
very
well
dear
price
voice
had
a
disappearing
quality
it
floated
and
drifted
from
her
lips
and
her
words
died
away
from
her
like
the
shed
petals
of
a
flower
i
want
i
want
you
and
papa
to
let
me
be
happy
i
i
sometimes
i
think
nobody
happy
mamma
and
papa
farley
are
not
i
above
winnie
bowed
head
and
price
exchanged
glances
they
do
deserve
to
be
price
snorted
after
a
minute
winnie
glanced
up
price
face
twitched
with
worry
now
perry
dear
please
remember
we
decided
not
to
speak
of
that
again
she
nodded
toward
the
closed
door
of
the
hall
i
suppose
by
now
you
have
heard
all
about
mamma
and
papa
farley
winnie
all
the
things
that
worried
your
father
so
that
he
tried
to
tell
you
about
when
you
and
laurence
ran
away
but
living
here
with
them
as
you
are
i
think
it
best
for
us
to
try
to
forget
it
farley
is
a
very
woman
and
has
borne
her
lot
very
patiently
winnie
wanted
to
ask
more
she
hid
her
face
again
once
laurie
laurence
never
talks
of
it
and
you
know
before
when
papa
tried
to
tell
me
how
it
was
you
would
let
him
what
was
it
mamma
do
we
need
to
talk
about
it
dear
price
stroked
winnie
hair
it
was
the
talk
about
the
town
i
do
see
why
she
should
hear
it
i
wanted
her
to
know
it
all
before
so
that
she
could
understand
my
objection
to
such
a
match
but
we
never
understood
clearly
how
it
was
ourselves
perry
you
know
when
winnie
was
married
and
you
wanted
to
tell
her
i
thought
it
was
no
fit
topic
for
a
young
girl
i
said
yes
i
know
you
but
if
she
had
known
all
about
the
thing
from
the
start
she
might
have
made
a
better
match
for
herself
at
any
rate
she
old
enough
to
hear
things
now
winnie
looked
up
and
stood
away
from
her
mother
please
papa
laurie
yes
perry
it
is
right
to
winnie
we
must
feel
this
way
about
her
husband
winnie
little
face
was
hard
and
a
small
soft
fire
of
malice
burned
in
her
eyes
though
she
resented
laurence
she
was
with
him
against
her
parents
she
would
have
exulted
in
making
them
feel
his
inexorableness
because
he
was
strong
against
them
she
seemed
to
feel
herself
inside
his
strength
corroding
it
with
her
weakness
mingled
with
her
desire
to
swallow
her
world
was
a
vague
terror
of
her
loneliness
when
it
should
happen
well
that
all
right
vivien
i
say
nothing
about
her
husband
but
that
of
hers
it
seems
to
me
the
more
she
knows
about
him
the
better
perry
but
in
their
house
price
was
weary
her
smile
seemed
to
hurt
her
her
white
hands

winnie
was
drawn
up
taut
cautious
like
a
savage
on
a
spoor

to
tell
me
all
of
it

said
but

a
woman

miserable
woman

was
entangled
with

that
filthy
affair

do
remember
whether
i
told
you
that
he
tried
to
leave
farley
and
live
with

a
child

gruffly
and
hurriedly
in
a
low
voice
and
chewed
his
mustache
winnie
trembled
with
excitement
mamma
and
papa
farley
laurie
she
felt
crafty
and
sure
of
herself
why

told
her
all
of
this
he
did
not
like
to
have
her
speak

things

on
his
toes
and
sucked
his
mustache
in
and
out
they
committed
every
sin
which
the
flesh
has
been
heir
to
since
the
fall
of
man
so
i
suppose
they
had
a
child
too
you
do
know
i
have
it
on
very
good
authority
that
they
did
the
child
of
course

spirited
away
and
where
did
the
woman
go
out
west
to
kansas
or
texas
something
still
he
rose
on
his
toes
the
flavor
of
his
mustache
seemed
to
give
him
a
peculiar
relish
oh
papa
how
awful
i
did
know
it
was
as
bad
as
that
winnie
dilated
with
her
secret
a
quick
passionate
resolution
of
triumph
shot
through
her
her
eyes
shone
tragically
winnie
my
dear
you

in
no
state
to
hear
things
like
this
price
said
there
was
a
light
knock
at
the
door
psh

a
little
but
continued
to
elevate
and
lower
himself
on
his
toes
and
stare
at
the
ceiling
winnie
clutched
her
hands
to
her
breast
come
in
price
lifted
her
trembling
voice
alice

in
the
doorway

conscious
pain

alice
out

bedroom

cluttered
by
too
great
an
attempt
at
coziness

grown
a
little
shabby
the
yellow
shades
were
drawn
under
the
lace
curtains
the
blue
carpet
showed
here
and
there
a
warp
of
colorless
cords
on
the
sofa
the
velvet
and
plush
pillows
were
embroidered
with
mottos
and
flowers
there
were
a
heavy
bureau
an
bed
and
bobby
crib
may
slept
in
the
nursery
across
the
hall
bobby
his
eyes
still
opaque
with
sleep
sat
upright
in
bed
a
dreamy
look
of
disapprobation
on
his
face
price
could
say
nothing
for
a
moment
then
how
lovely
how
lovely
what
a
beautiful
healthy
child
winnie
caught
him
in
her
arms
farley
moved
forward
feebly
shocked
he
too
heavy
oh
you
must
do
that
winnie
winnie
turned
and
gave
him
to
her
mother

sodden
and
relaxed
in
his
grandmother
arms

resigned

over
him
agitatedly
he
so
beautiful
feeling
ashamed
she
knew
not
why
she
kissed
him
look
perry
fine
boy
said
price
winnie
danced
about
i
knew
you
think
so
farley
waited
sheepishly
approving
with
his
patience
we
all
proud
of
him
said
alice
shortly
price
glanced
up
with
a
start
he
a
fine
grandson
she
declared
after
a
minute
there
was
something
defiant
in
the
way
she
stroked
his
hair
but
she
remained
very
gentle
and
ladylike
may
stood
to
one
side
quivering
she
wanted
them
to
see
her
but
for
fear
they
might
send
her
away
kept
very
quiet
when
bobby
did
not
want
to
be
petted
she
was
uncomfortable
and
when
he
liked
it
she
was
happy
too
laurence
had
come
into
the
house
and
finding
the
lower
floor
deserted
had
gone
upstairs
he
stood
in
the
bedroom
doorway
winnie
saw
him
first
she
was
disconcerted
for
a
moment
a
little
shiver
of
excitement
went
through
her
but
she
recovered
herself
as
she
gazed
at
him
and
felt
small
and
strong
laurie
she
made
a
cooing
sound
of
pleasure
she
turned
to
her
mother
oh
mamma
i
want
you
and
laurie
to
hug
price
face
was
stained
with
faint
color
she
grew
brittle
and
tense
in
her
uncertainty
holding
bobby
on
her
arm
she
put
her
hand
out
it
was
as
if
she
put
her
hand
between
herself
and
laurence
i
hope
we
both
love
winnie
enough
to
overlook
things
she
said
i
hope
so
price
he
agreed
coming
forward
his
lids
drooping
as
if
to
shut
out
the
painful
sight
of
them
all
he
smiled
in
shame
they
shook
hands
now
papa
winnie
led
her
father
forward
by
his
coat
sleeve
d
farley
d
price
was
bluff
and
reluctant
their
hands
barely
touched
laurence
kept
his
glance
on
the
carpet
now
i
am
so
happy
winnie
clung
to
her
husband
arm
her
softness
sank
into
him
he
felt
that
if
he
lived
he
must
harden
himself
against
it
when
she
finally
freed
him
he
drew
a
deep
unconscious
breath
then
he
forced
his
somber
eyes
full
on
price
face
i
am
thankful
for
winnie
sake
that
you
and
price
made
up
your
minds
to
this
he
said
we
wo
reproach
ourselves
with
the
past
farley
price
interrupted
he
would
not
allow
his
wife
to
be
addressed
in
lieu
of
himself
i
never
reproached
myself
price
laurence
answered
coldly
still
he
looked
away
i
do
doubt
it
laurence
farley
i
do
doubt
it
manner
was
full
of
secret
scorn
he
rocked
on
his
toes
and
sucked
his
mustache
ends
again
the
babies
are
dears
price
said
bobby
is
wonderful
laurence
regarded
bobby
sit
up
hold
your
head
up
do
act
as
though
you
were
half
asleep
do
be
cross
with
him
laurie
winnie
pouted
laurence
was
torn
he
must
refuse
to
praise
bobby
as
the
prices
praised
him
laurence
felt
that
he
could
not
protect
his
child
against
the
approbation
of
his
enemies
may
sidled
up
to
her
father
when
she
touched
him
he
did
not
look
down
at
her
but
put
his
arm
about
her
he
held
his
shame
of
her
close
in
his
heart
like
a
wound
that
he
would
not
let
be
seen
he
stroked
her
hair
bobby
is
too
heavy
for
you
price
farley
protested
coming
forward
with
an
air
of
furtive
protest
no
no
price
exaggeratedly
polite
held
him
closer
and
smiled
the
smile
made
farley
helpless
price
knew
it
farley
had
been
outside
the
group
now
he
moved
nearer
price
and
leaning
forward
shook
bobby
inert
fist
you
like
your
old
grandad
eh
you
like
your
old
grandad
bobby
scowled
on
them
all
and
put
his
thumb
to
his
mouth
what
did
i
tell
you
about
sucking
your
thumb
laurence
demanded
sternly
winnie
sweet
eyes
covert
with
knowledge
gloated
on
her
face
do
be
cross
to
him
laurie
when
everything
so
nice
stop
sucking
your
thumb
laurence
took
bobby
thumb
down
from
his
mouth
for
heaven
sake
leave
him
alone
you
nag
him
to
death
all
this
ohing
and
ahing
is
enough
to
drive
him
to
something
worse
than
sucking
his
thumb
alice
said
shortly
laurence
gave
her
a
swift
contemptuous
glance
of
anger
but
controlled
himself
that
a
good
boy
he
said
more
kindly
as
bobby
lifted
himself
straighter
and
stared
around
oh
everything
so
nice
i
was
so
afraid
it
would
be
winnie
sighed
again
with
happiness
laurence
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
the
delicate
hand
that
below
the
coarse
sleeve
of
his
coat
was
like
the
revelation
of
a
secret
you
did
think
your
husband
was
going
to
refuse
to
shake
hands
with
me
i
hope
price
demanded
his
unsmiling
joviality
was
terrifying
no
one
could
ever
say
exactly
when
he
became
serious
and
he
was
perfectly
aware
of
the
tremors
of
uncertainty
that
stirred
in
his
hearers
he
enjoyed
disturbing
them
we
are
exercising
mutual
forbearance
laurence
put
in
quietly
in
the
irritation
of
price
presence
something
was
slipping
from
laurence
grasp
it
was
only
that
he
continued
to
hold
himself
forbearance
toward
me
i
hope
you
do
think
i
want
you
to
exercise
forbearance
toward
my
religious
views
young
man
has
he
come
to
his
senses
since
you
married
him
winnie
winnie
smiled
feebly
laurence
looked
at
the
floor
his
lip
twitched
price
seemed
to
wish
to
drown
out
the
echo
of
his
words
in
the
ears
of
those
present
and
began
to
talk
fiercely
to
bobby
fine
child
father
not
going
to
raise
you
up
to
be
a
prizefighter
is
he
surprise
me
i
hope
your
mother
bring
you
up
as
a
godfearing
man
she
must
leave
your
education
regarding
the
next
world
to
your
father
you
better
take
him
in
hand
winnie
he
stared
at
his
daughter
with
his
vague
hard
eyes
laurence
felt
his
parenthood
raped
winnie
and
i
have
come
to
a
perfect
understanding
regarding
bobby
education
he
sneered
price
glanced
up
at
laurence
have
eh
ai
you
an
atheist
last
time
i
talked
with
you
did
you
tell
me
you
were
an
atheist
i
did
price
i
afraid
i
am
deficient
in
tact
smiling
laurence
lifted
eyes
in
which
the
light
of
hate
was
drawn
inward
toward
some
obscure
point
of
agony
price
set
bobby
on
the
floor
his
legs
were
stiff
with
being
held
and
he
made
a
few
steps
away
from
her
uncertainly
like
a
drunkard
the
dear
child
she
murmured
uneasily
her
quiet
smile
was
over
her
face
like
the
still
surface
of
a
pool
filled
underneath
with
little
frightened
fish
tact
eh
price
was
not
sure
what
the
remark
meant
but
to
give
himself
time
permitted
a
knowing
twinkle
to
creep
into
his
eyes
he
rose
on
his
toes
if
you
leave
off
trying
to
set
up
science
in
the
place
of
god
we
overlook
your
lack
of
tact
he
conceded
finally
laurence
bit
his
lips
he
assumed
an
irritating
air
of
indulgent
amusement
it
was
irresistible
he
dared
not
look
at
winnie
i
sworn
to
preserve
a
reverential
silence
in
regard
to
all
of
your
pet
fallacies
mr
price
my
pet
fallacies
eh
the
years
have
taught
you
respect
for
the
opinions
of
your
betters
then
i
never
met
them
laurence
said
farley
coughed
price
had
called
bobby
back
and
was
talking
to
him
in
a
low
tone
very
intently
farley
talked
to
bobby
too
alice
made
with
her
tongue
a
clicking
sound
of
impatience
laurence
had
moved
away
from
may
she
watched
the
men
in
controversy
her
mouth
hung
stupidly
open
she
had
a
shivering
white
face
and
her
eyes
were
all
pupil
she
looked
as
though
she
had
drowned
herself
in
the
darkness
of
her
own
eyes
please
you
two
winnie
laced
and
unlaced
her
fingers
you
have
you
know
when
you
in
the
wrong
do
you
on
the
rare
occasions
when
that
happens
laurence
said
with
an
ostentatious
affectation
of
good
humor
and
you
have
found
out
yet
that
you
committing
a
sin
when
you
set
yourself
up
in
opposition
to
divine
truth
you
very
complaisant
young
man
very
complaisant
but
i
tell
you
that
natural
science
is
out
of
date
the
darwinists
and
haeckelists
and
the
rest
of
the
dirty
crew
have
to
come
crawling
back
to
the
creator
they
denied
with
their
tails
between
their
legs
you
making
a
dangerous
admission
in
acknowledging
such
an
appendage
mr
price
smiling
at
the
floor
laurence
reached
out
and
drew
may
to
him
again
he
defied
them
with
his
loyalty
to
her
am
i
the
devil
had
a
tail
before
he
ever
heard
of
darwin
seems
to
me
price
was
still
uneasy
but
swelled
a
little
with
the
readiness
of
his
retort
laurie
winnie
patted
laurence
sleeve
her
voice
humble
the
humility
in
her
voice
inferred
something
in
him
which
outraged
his
and
i
have
a
doubt
that
as
in
the
present
case
the
ass
had
ears
he
said
sharply
winnie
began
to
cry
i
go
winnie
he
told
her
it
was
inevitable
he
had
been
that
way
before
with
price
his
hand
fell
from
may
shoulder
he
walked
out
in
the
silence
the
group
could
hear
the
thick
beat
of
his
feet
as
he
descended
the
carpeted
stairs
and
the
reverberation
of
the
front
door
which
he
slammed
as
he
passed
into
the
street
price
face
was
a
dull
red
he
puffed
out
his
cheeks
that
what
it
comes
to
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
unutterably
and
turned
with
a
gesture
of
departure
and
dismissal
please
do
go
father
farley
was
wringing
her
hands
as
may
watched
she
seemed
to
be
weeping
from
her
own
eyes
her
mother
tears
for
heaven
sake
do
take
laurence
seriously
price
said
alice
price
lifted
both
hands
with
the
palms
out
i
do
i
do
god
forbid
that
any
one
should
take
that
foolhardy
blasphemy
seriously
farley
passed
his
hand
over
his
face
as
though
to
brush
away
a
cloud
his
eyes
were
uneasy
his
smile
one
of
apology
laurence
will
regret
it
as
soon
as
he
is
in
the
street
regret
regret
not
the
right
emotion
to
recall
that
kind
of
talk
i
take
no
account
of
what
he
said
to
me
but
no
one
can
go
about
in
contempt
of
the
god
who
made
him
and
not
suffer
for
it
i
know
farley
hesitated
his
lips
quivered
a
little
oh
i
knew
i
could
be
happy
sobbed
winnie
price
took
her
daughter
in
her
arms
now
dear
your
father
has
made
up
his
mind
to
be
forbearing
he
wo
go
back
on
his
word
no
i
wo
go
back
on
my
word
but
i
do
know
whether
i
can
ever
bring
myself
to
the
point
of
coming
into
this
house
again
not
when
that
man
here
you
ought
to
take
laurence
seriously
price
alice
repeated
i
think
we
ought
to
forget
about
him
and
not
spoil
winnie
day
i
ca
forget
about
him
alice
winnie
lifted
her
head
indignantly
from
her
mother
shoulder
deep
in
her
imagination
winnie
in
a
lace
nightdress
was
putting
her
arms
about
laurie
neck
her
veins
swelled
strong
and
taut
with
confidence
she
resented
the
injustice
of
being
forced
to
choose
between
laurence
and
her
parents
because
of
other
things
she
could
not
forgive
she
would
pardon
him
the
day
scene
but
she
would
not
pardon
her
parents
yet
it
all
right
dear
miss
farley
do
mean
that
she
only
wants
us
to
forget
the
things
your
husband
said
to
your
father
and
i
think
that
is
exactly
right
after
he
considers
it
i
am
sure
he
will
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
acted
wrongly
and
be
sorry
too
i
had
so
much
trouble
winnie
went
on
come
bobby
let
us
all
go
downstairs
and
play
games
and
help
mamma
to
forget
her
troubles
alice
jerked
bobby
hand
leaning
on
her
mother
winnie
followed
farley
her
eyes
with
unshed
tears
of
perplexity
shambled
after
her
dress
rustling
and
disturbing
her
desire
for
farley
descended
the
stairs
with
finger
tips
gliding
along
the
rail
smiling
the
abased
smile
of
a
blind
man
may
hesitating
on
each
step
dragged
unnoticed
a
long
way
behind
in
the
early
morning
the
cloudy
air
had
a
texture
like
wet
wool
the
sky
radiated
colorless
heat
like
a
pool
of
warm
water
which
one
saw
into
from
the
depths
work
had
not
yet
begun
on
the
corner
house
but
in
front
of
it
dangled
platforms
suspended
from
pulleys
the
vacant
windows
smeared
with
paint
gave
the
house
the
look
of
a
silly
face
smeared
with
weeping
an
expression
of
tortured
immobility
alice
on
her
way
to
work
had
just
emerged
from
her
front
doorway
as
she
descended
to
the
street
she
watched
ahead
of
her
a
tall
very
thin
woman
in
a
worn
silk
blouse
and
an
old
skirt
that
still
smacked
of
an
ultra
mode
the
woman
dragged
beside
her
a
very
little
boy
in
tight
pants
and
a
gay
shirt
the
little
boy
swinging
by
her
hand
leaned
heavily
away
from
her
to
pull
a
small
red
wooden
wagon
after
him
when
the
woman
turned
her
head
alice
saw
her
bright
blonde
hair
combed
in
glossy
and
salient
puffs
a
cheap
and
unconscious
defiance
above
her
wasted
face
and
her
breasts
sucked
dry
on
her
flat
body
alice
walked
after
her
life
thinking
of
money
in
the
hot
bed
they
touched
each
other
rent
due
the
child
began
to
cry
old
maid
barricaded
behind
ridicule
coolness
of
being
outside
loneliness
like
a
cool
wound
the
woman
went
on
taller
narrower
in
distance
with
her
long
limbs
and
graceful
stoop
she
resembled
a
sculptured
angel
tomb
apartment
the
woman
walked
before
alice
into
a
narrow
marble
doorway
the
stone
rolled
back
and
the
angel
went
into
the
tomb
haggard
and
bitter
face
a
little
rouge
put
on
carelessly
despair
no
one
knows
why
laurence
had
come
in
during
the
night
and
gone
to
sleep
on
the
box
couch
without
disturbing
winnie
in
the
morning
she
was
the
first
to
awaken
it
had
rained
before
dawn
the
hot
sun
floated
outside
the
window
in
voluptuous
mists
the
white
curtains
seemed
stained
with
the
light
they
swayed
and
parted
and
between
their
folds
the
moist
air
flowed
heavily
from
the
steaming
street
winnie
could
hear
the
staccato
tap
of
a
hammer
on
the
house
next
door
horses
hoofs
rang
on
the
asphalt
with
a
flat
sound
the
curtains
opened
like
lips
and
made
a
whispering
noise
then
winnie
could
see
the
wet
bronze
roof
opposite
shining
blankly
against
the
faint
bright
sky
the
room
was
crowded
with
the
atmosphere
of
two
people
who
have
quarreled
they
were
oppressed
by
their
consciousness
of
each
other
through
the
darkness
of
his
shut
lids
laurence
only
feigning
sleep
tried
to
ascend
above
the
close
room
and
his
almost
intolerable
awareness
of
winnie
presence
she
had
seen
his
lids
flutter
tired
and
sweet
she
regarded
him
mercilessly
she
could
see
how
tense
the
lines
of
his
body
were
under
the
couch
cover
he
had
drawn
up
over
his
feet
his
lids
pressed
tight
together
twitched
a
little
laurie
with
a
helpless
feeling
he
opened
his
eyes
winnie
heart
beat
combatively
triumphantly
i
been
lying
here
looking
at
you
she
said
her
plaintive
pout
begging
him
to
infer
everything
bobby
still
asleep
bobby
lay
in
his
little
bed
relaxed
like
a
drowned
child
his
lips
were
pale
his
face
damp
with
the
heat
his
shock
of
blonde
hair
fell
back
on
the
pillow
away
from
his
head
winnie
beside
her
big
baby
abandoned
herself
to
a
sense
of
dependence
which
she
felt
him
to
justify
yes
i
must
have
slept
very
hard
in
an
effort
to
hide
his
surprise
laurence
responded
quickly
to
her
overture
he
sat
up
smiling
elaborately
and
began
rubbing
his
eyes
winnie
would
not
let
him
escape
through
such
casualness
are
you
still
angry
with
me
laurie
she
lifted
herself
among
the
pillows
and
rested
on
one
elbow
there
was
a
terrible
youngness
about
her
soft
hungrily
uplifted
face
her
thin
neck
the
collar
bones
showing
below
her
white
throat
her
eagerness
was
too
vivid
he
was
conscious
of
her
rapacious
youth
it
made
him
tired
youth
demanding
of
him
life
and
more
life
winnie
was
ill
but
there
was
no
rest
for
them
even
in
her
pain
he
felt
old
and
afraid
of
her
as
though
he
would
never
be
able
to
get
up
from
the
couch
angry
with
you
was
i
angry
with
you
he
covered
his
eyes
his
lips
smiling
below
his
fingers
were
deprecating
he
stood
up
slowly
and
lifted
his
trousers
from
a
chair
he
felt
ridiculous
to
himself
putting
them
on
laurie
please
do
be
angry
with
me
for
wanting
to
see
mamma
he
was
hurt
without
knowing
how
she
hurt
him
please
kiss
me
laurie
dear
do
be
angry
i
ca
bear
to
have
you
angry
with
me
her
eyes
strangely
defenseless
opened
softly
to
his
their
softness
enveloped
him
and
drew
him
down
against
the
harsh
little
sparks
of
reserve
that
burnt
in
their
depths
kiss
you
he
said
he
took
her
fingers
in
his
and
kissed
them
his
lips
were
grudging
he
still
smiled
do
accuse
me
of
being
angry
with
you
winnie
i
want
you
to
have
your
mother
back
but
i
want
you
too
kiss
me
not
like
that
he
leaned
forward
and
his
lips
brushed
hers
but
she
would
not
let
him
go
she
was
so
slight
pulling
him
down
that
he
could
not
resist
her
she
pressed
her
mouth
hard
against
his
face
do
be
angry
with
me
i
not
angry
was
angry
each
word
was
a
little
shake
to
loosen
himself
from
her
you
wo
talk
to
papa
that
way
again
i
wo
give
myself
the
opportunity
i
wo
see
him
again
oh

he
withdrew
above
her
making
himself
paternal
you
must
be
sensible
about
this
thing
winnie

i
want
you
to
see

little
unreasonable
i
ca

sick

laurie
i
wo

operated
on
i
bear
it
her
voice
was
passionate
she
shrank
looking
smaller
among
the
big
pillows
he
pushed
her
into
the
limbo
of
invalidism
she
did
not
know
how
to
get
out
his
kindness
was
a
wall
between
them
he
smoothed
her
hair
she
was
crushed
under
his
tolerant
hand
smoothing
away
curls
from
her
face
shall
i
tell
mamma
farley
you
are
ready
for
your
breakfast
she
gazed
at
him
her
eyes
hurt
him
they
stabbed
him
through
the
silence
she
made
laurie
i
think
we
are
going
to
be
so
happy
and
then
all
at
once
when
you
talk
about
my
being
sick
you
seem
so
far
away
you
do
love
me
she
clung
to
his
arm
of
course
then
kiss
me
again
he
kissed
her
her
terrible
hunger
hurt
and
confused
him
he
would
rather
not
have
seen
her
thin
throat
that
suggested
a
young
swan
her
pointed
chin
her
eyes
and
the
reddish
hair
which
had
slipped
in
confusion
about
her
shoulders
the
room
filled
with
her
choked
him
her
clothes
on
a
chair
some
soiled
satin
slippers
the
mirror
from
which
she
seemed
always
to
shine
her
child
asleep
hers
and
his
together
he
could
not
explain
himself
felt
that
he
was
growing
hard
he
was
ashamed
of
not
loving
her
enough
ashamed
of
the
strength
it
gave
him
to
know
that
he
was
not
for
her
now
that
her
health
was
keeping
them
apart
i
want
us
to
be
happier
than
anybody
laurie
your
father
you
never
talk
to
me
about
it
that
woman
out
west
who
had
a
child
by
him
so
so
terrible
she
felt
his
resentment
of
her
persistent
reference
to
it
there
was
something
drunken
in
her
which
made
her
sling
out
words
that
were
not
wanted
she
regretted
a
little
this
waste
of
her
hoarded
knowledge
but
at
the
same
time
she
was
glad
he
did
not
want
to
talk
of
it
she
felt
injured
because
he
did
not
want
to
talk
to
her
of
it
she
leaned
against
him
the
tears
ran
from
her
blind
uplifted
eyes
that
nonsense
winnie
what
have
we
to
do
with
them
i
want
you
to
be
happy
too
he
sat
down
beside
her
she
felt
hopeless
as
though
she
had
lost
him
not
just
me
laurie
both
of
us
of
course
both
of
us
she
was
crushed
you
did
know
i
knew
all
about
your
father
laurie
no
i
never
told
you
the
details
because
it
did
seem
worth
while
you
never
tell
me
anything
not
about
yourself
or
anything
i
did
think
i
could
tell
you
anything
about
myself
you
did
know
already
do
joke
i
want
you
to
love
me
i
do
love
you
she
was
tired
she
buried
her
face
in
the
pillows
he
rose
from
the
bed
and
put
on
the
rest
of
his
clothes
but
when
he
said
to
her
she
would
not
answer
him
he
outraged
the
essence
of
her
sex
she
was
weak
she
wanted
him
to
be
weaker
than
she
she
felt
that
he
owed
it
to
her
it
was
a
crumb
from
his
strength
she
felt
to
be
weak
to
her
who
had
to
be
weak
to
the
whole
world
she
would
not
forgive
him
laurence
went
out
of
the
room
out
of
the
house
a
pale
fiery
mist
rose
up
from
between
the
houses
and
filled
the
wet
morning
street
the
houses
with
lowered
blinds
were
secret
and
filled
with
women
girls
going
to
work
came
out
of
the
houses
like
the
words
of
women
women
going
to
market
passed
slowly
before
him
with
their
baskets
pregnant
women
walked
before
him
in
confidence
the
uncolored
atmosphere
threw
back
the
sky
it
was
the
mirror
of
women
laurence
felt
crowded
between
the
bodies
of
women
and
houses
he
walked
quickly
with
his
head
bent
on
the
concrete
pavements
washed
white
as
bones
by
the
storm
of
the
night
before
were
puddles
dark
and
still
they
quivered
now
and
again
like
quiet
minds
touched
by
the
horror
of
a
recollection
the
reflections
of
the
houses
lay
deep
in
them
shattered
like
dead
things
farley
stumbled
up
the
dark
stairway
her
knotted
fingers
with
their
skin
kept
a
tense
and
fearful
grasp
on
the
scratched
rim
of
the
lacquered
tray
on
the
clean
frayed
napkin
she
had
put
one
of
her
best
plates
and
on
it
rested
a
bloody
peach
and
a
dull
bright
knife
the
peach
balanced
uncertainly
rolled
a
little
as
farley
moved
the
knife
clinked
black
coffee
beaded
with
gold
turned
to
saffron
when
it
poured
over
into
the
saucer
the
toast
burnt
a
little
along
the
edges
slid
back
and
forth
in
the
napkin
which
enfolded
it
she
stopped
before
winnie
room
winnie
her
voice
sounded
cracked
with
fatigue
with
the
tip
of
her
black
slipper
which
was
rough
and
gray
with
wear
she
pushed
the
door
back
the
room
opened
bright
before
her
her
smile
grew
hard
and
solicitous
winnie
sat
up
straight
among
the
creased
pillows
against
the
dark
old
headboard
her
eyes
were
red
she
smiled
too
and
was
consciously
brave
good
morning
mamma
farley

how
you
have
worked
for
poor
little
me
put
the
tray
down
and
let
me
kiss
you
bobby
is
awake
farley
asked
embarrassed
by
her
own
pleasure
as
she
pressed
bitter
and
grateful
lips
to
winnie
firm
cheek
are

glad
i
was
happy

shakily
on
the
tossed
bed
clothes

too
mamma
farley
dear
i
want
you
to
be
happy
too
winnie
held
out
a
small
inexorable
hand
and
farley
unable
to
behave
otherwise
took
it
winnie
squeezed
her
fingers
i
know
you
have
always
been
happy
mamma
dear
winnie
dim
eyes
were
lustful
with
pity
farley
was
frightened
her
hand
trembled
and
she
tried
to
pull
back
and
resist
the
invitation
of
sympathy
papa
farley
ought
to
love
you
more
than
anybody
in
the
world
winnie
asserted
passionately
tender
farley
was
shaken
who
been
talking
to
winnie
she
pressed
her
lips
quiveringly
shut
her
eyeglasses
twinkled
and
shuddered
with
her
heaving
breast
winnie
felt
herself
strong
with
a
love
that
nothing
could
resist
exultant
she
gloated
inwardly
over
the
knotted
hand
that
trembled
in
her
grasp
your
parents
i
do
know
we
wo
talk
about
old
people
troubles
winnie
farley
was
recovering
herself
perhaps
winnie
did
mean
that
i
suppose
papa
farley
loves
me
in
his
way
just
as
you
love
me
in
yours
winnie
would
not
let
her
go
you
stand
up
for
him
you
so
good
to
him
she
insisted
with
a
kind
of
worshiping
commiseration
why
should
i
be
farley
dared
trying
to
smile
while
she
frowned
her
evasive
eyes
shifting
a
little
because
he
do
deserve
it
because
he
did
what
he
did
oh
mamma
farley
i
know
you
do
want
me
to
talk
about
it
but
i
ca
help
it
i
love
you
so
you
so
wonderful
to
me
winnie
eyes
shone
mercilessly
sweet
into
the
hunted
eyes
of
the
elder
woman
i
do
know
what
you
mean
winnie
they
looked
at
each
other
mamma
farley
could
not
look
she
picked
at
the
sheet
you
dear
you
dear
winnie
hugged
her
she
was
crying
again
they
leaned
apart
and
regarded
one
another
inflamed
withered
eyelids
twitched
do
you
think
laurence
really
loves
me
i
so
afraid
winnie
said
suddenly
of
course
winnie
oh
mamma
farley
i
want
to
be
happy
i
could
bear
it
if
laurence
she
buried
her
face
in
mamma
farley
dress
farley
stroked
her
hair
we
all
foolish
when
we
young
but
god
is
good
to
us
when
we
grow
old
we
can
have
a
little
peace
but
you
young
enough
even
for
the
kind
of
thing
you
want
her
pale
mouth
had
a
shriveled
look
of
bitterness
love
between
men
and
women
the
love
you
are
thinking
about
is
not
much
in
life
winnie
but
i
could
bear
not
to
have
not
to
have
anybody
love
me
look
in
the
mirror
they
love
you
farley
eyes
in
her
wet
wrinkled
face
were
hard
with
contempt
under
the
seared
granuled
lids
winnie
lying
back
gloated
over
the
thin
white
hair
the
lined
flaccid
cheeks
and
the
eyes
that
glowed
with
weeping
winnie
swam
in
the
strength
of
love
like
a
swimmer
sure
of
himself
in
trusted
waters
she
was
grateful
to
the
age
and
ugliness
which
did
not
claim
her
farley
did
not
want
winnie
to
gaze
at
her
any
more
look
awake
she
said
winnie
was
satisfied
and
ready
to
be
glad
of
bobby
too
the
child
sat
up
drunkenly
his
touseled
hair
matted
with
sweat
lay
dark
on
his
brow
his
eyelids
were
pale
and
swollen
with
sleep
he
rubbed
them
with
his
fists
children
are
the
surest
happiness
farley
said
winnie
was
oppressed
i
so
afraid
of
being
sick
mamma
farley
you
soon
be
well
i
hope
farley
had
an
air
of
resolution
and
dismissal
she
went
squinting
to
the
crib
my
what
a
sleepy
boy
laurie
love
children
winnie
had
a
terrible
sense
that
she
was
losing
some
unknown
thing
which
was
precious
and
belonged
to
her
but
of
which
she
was
afraid
his
night
drawers
are
too
small
his
grandmother
have
to
make
him
some
there
some
nice
stuff
at
that
store
next
to
the
bakery
they
talked
of
shops
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
seemed
to
lift
with
the
lightness
and
sureness
of
their
talk
they
were
safe
and
at
rest
among
unchanging
irrelevances
women
knew
best
the
sureness
of
trifles
these
were
the
things
which
did
not
change
which
men
could
not
change
late
afternoon
there
was
no
sun
below
the
blank
gray
sky
the
long
blank
street
along
the
street
a
pair
of
sleek
and
ponderous
black
horses
with
thick
manes
and
shaggy
fetlocks
plodded
before
a
loaded
dray
their
bodies
rocked
and
swayed
tensely
with
strain
their
huge
feet
clattered
and
strove
against
the
asphalt
the
hands
of
the
driver
red
with
full
knotted
veins
hung
loose
between
his
knees
holding
the
slack
reins
his
body
in
a
khaki
shirt
was
hunched
forward
miserably
from
his
fat
stupid
face
his
eyes
glanced
dully
under
a
bare
thatch
of
neutral
tinted
hair
only
the
horses
purposeful
and
immense
in
their
obedience
seemed
to
understand
in
the
gutter
a
mild
and
tired
pushed
dry
manure
into
heaps
again
and
again
he
stooped
and
lifted
the
shovel
and
the
manure
fell
into
a
cart
he
wore
ragged
white
gloves
too
large
for
him
he
was
patient
but
his
gaze
roamed
vague
with
speculation
servant
of
the
horses
that
dirtied
the
street
he
was
less
sure
than
they
at
the
corner
house
work
was
over
for
the
day
the
abandoned
platforms
of
the
painters
dangled
loosely
on
the
long
ropes
through
the
smeared
you
saw
empty
rooms
blank
as
the
faces
of
idiot
women
waiting
for
love
alice
walked
slowly
home
from
work
she
saw
her
own
windows
where
the
awnings
did
not
stir
drooping
they
cast
their
scalloped
outlines
vaguely
into
the
depths
of
the
glass
may
was
on
the
front
step
hello
may
aunt
alice
voice
very
gruff
may
sucked
her
finger
and
ducked
her
head
sidewise
smiling
her
finger
slipped
out
of
her
mouth
with
a
plop
she
put
it
back
between
her
wet
lips
coming
in
aunt
alice
held
the
door
back
may
went
after
her
into
the
hall
that
was
full
of
the
smell
of
baking
bread
aunt
alice
threw
off
her
hat
and
walked
into
the
may
trailed
after
her
in
limp
timidity
winnie
in
her
lilac
négligé
sat
in
an
armchair
oh
alice
i
been
talking
to
the
doctor
again
and
he
so
horrid
he
says
i
should
have
been
operated
on
right
after
bobby
was
born
and
now
i
getting
worse
alice
stood
beside
the
chair
and
stared
down
doctors
like
to
croak
winnie
reached
up
and
clutched
alice
square
dark
hand
winnie
white
fingers
were
little
claws
digging
into
alice
swarthy
flesh
say
i
do
have
to
i
ca
alice
i
ca
well
i
certainly
would
until
i
got
into
better
shape
nervously
than
you
are
now
mother
wants
me
to
go
away
with
her
and
i
do
dare
i
know
it
would
do
me
good
but
i
do
dare
alice
winnie
half
sobbed
do
dare
what
rot
why
should
you
dare
laurie
will
hate
me
if
i
go
off
with
mother
it
does
matter
how
sick
i
am
he
will
hate
me
winnie
you
talking
the
most
unmitigated
nonsense
i
not
alice
you
do
know
he
ca
forgive
me
for
wanting
to
be
kind
to
mother
i
have
noticed
any
signs
of
unforgiveness
on
his
part
i
admit
he
acted
like
a
fool
on
sunday
but
i
suppose
he
ca
be
blamed
your
father
not
the
easiest
person
in
the
world
to
get
on
with
himself
i
know
but
you
do
understand
sometimes
i
think
laurie
hates
me
for
being
sick
he
do
love
me
any
more
i
know
he
do
laurence
hate
you
for
being
sick
good
god
then
alice
added
you
should
talk
this
way
before
may
winnie
winnie
had
her
eyes
shut
she
made
a
gesture
away
with
her
hands
go
out
may
may
moved
into
a
shadow
by
the
door
but
she
did
not
go
out
i
ca
bear
being
sick
it
me
so
old
papa
farley
that
time
papa
farley
that
woman
they
had
a
child
told
me
oh
do
you
suppose
laurence
will
do
like
that
like
what
alice
voice
was
sharp
almost
threatening
with
distrust
winnie
kept
her
eyes
shut
and
wrung
her
hands
i
thought
you
knew
all
about
it
alice
about
what
do
act
as
though
you
could
forgive
me
that
woman
out
west
and
and
your
father
started
to
get
a
divorce
and
gave
it
up
so
afraid
laurence
wo
love
me
any
more
alice
knew
that
her
parents
had
had
some
trouble
it
was
the
year
she
was
away
at
school
she
had
heard
fragments
allusions
now
she
felt
strange
she
wanted
to
hear
more
but
could
not
not
from
winnie
lips
alice
coarsely
fine
face
burnt
bronze
with
shame
her
sad
eyes
of
thick
brown
searched
winnie
evasive
features
distrustfully
you
must
talk
about
this
winnie
alice
said
in
the
first
place
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
laurence
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
laurence
cares
for
nobody
but
you
and
never
will
i
do
believe
he
feels
hard
toward
you
because
you
want
to
see
your
mother
now
you
angry
with
me
i
not
i
going
upstairs
to
wash
and
brush
you
cut
out
this
morbid
nonsense
winnie
alice
smiled
a
hard
kind
dismissing
smile
and
turned
away
walking
briskly
out
with
her
firm
awkward
stride
may
edged
out
of
the
shadow
and
came
nearer
her
mother
it
was
half
dark
in
the
room
winnie
sniffed
oblivious
to
may
may
came
and
stood
very
near
she
reached
over
and
passed
a
hesitant
hand
along
the
arm
of
her
mother
chair
winnie
started
may
drew
back
and
stood
teetering
on
one
foot
her
face
alternately
dark
and
smiling
oh
may
i
you
to
go
out
may
hung
her
head
a
sort
of
shiver
like
the
shimmer
of
water
passed
over
her
pale
uneasy
face
she
wanted
to
go
toward
her
mother
wanted
almost
unendurably
to
go
but
something
in
her
mother
held
her
off
may
was
in
torment
between
the
two
impulses
which
possessed
her
equally
winnie
wiped
her
eyes
come
here
she
said
at
last
may
went
forward
smiling
trembling
half
released
you
love
me
may
may
could
not
speak
she
choked
with
affirmation
her
face
was
in
winnie
warm
neck
may
lost
herself
in
the
warm
throat
and
the
soft
hair
if
she
did
not
have
to
see
her
mother
eyes
it
was
well
may
had
a
terror
of
eyes
they
made
her
know
things
about
herself
which
she
could
not
bear
sharp
looks
splintered
her
consciousness
winnie
overcoming
a
shudder
admitted
the
caress
you
always
love
mother
wo
you
after
the
evening
meal
farley
took
a
newspaper
into
the
there
he
sat
by
the
lamp
with
the
green
shade
through
the
still
room
the
light
concentrated
under
the
lamp
shade
rushed
to
the
carpet
on
the
way
it
spread
glistening
over
the
oak
table
and
brightened
of
farley
face
the
newspaper
in
his
hands
was
glassy
with
light
the
print
looked
gray
the
rain
that
made
the
air
sharp
had
not
yet
fallen
and
the
dim
curtains
against
the
open
windows
shook
now
and
then
as
with
sudden
palpitant
breaths
alice
walked
about
the
room
nervously
several
times
she
went
to
the
window
and
glanced
out
when
she
pulled
the
curtain
back
her
newspaper
flapped
against
his
hand
but
he
showed
no
impatience
alice
came
and
stood
before
his
chair
come
go
for
a
walk
with
me
walk
he
looked
up
at
her
he
was
vaguely
patient
and
smiling
a
little
is
it
raining
no
come
along
alice
took
his
arm
he
folded
his
paper
carefully
and
placed
it
on
the
table
then
stiff
and
heavy
in
his
movements
he
got
up
alice
dragged
him
into
the
hall
and
he
took
his
hat
down
you
ought
to
have
something
over
your
head
he
said
to
her
rubbish
it
summer
come
on
alice
flung
the
front
door
wide
the
wind
took
their
breaths
for
a
second
he
stumbled
a
little
as
he
followed
her
down
the
steps
and
into
the
empty
street
overhead
the
moon
a
lurid
yellow
scudded
between
transparent
black
clouds
it
too
stormy
to
walk
we
must
go
far
or
the
rain
will
catch
us
it
wo
yet
awhile
i
had
to
get
out
of
that
house
alice
linked
her
arm
in
his
she
could
feel
his
discomfort
in
her
talk
as
though
it
came
through
her
sleeve
against
him
i
sorry
to
hear
you
talk
about
your
home
like
that
alice
farley
sounded
hurt
who
would
i
loathe
mamma
that
all
farley
arm
quivered
where
it
brushed
alice
shoulder
unjust
to
her
she
done
the
best
she
can
for
you
has
she
well
my
god
she
could
have
done
worse
i
do
think
you
just
to
her
they
walked
on
alice
heavy
skirt
beat
her
ankles
above
her
stout
shoes
farley
flapped
paper
rustled
in
the
gutter
you
make
me
sick
about
being
just
to
mamma
alice
said
almost
tenderly
whom
was
she
ever
just
to
what
about
being
just
to
yourself
we
ca
ask
too
much
for
ourselves
in
this
life
farley
said
soberly
bosh
i
wish
to
heaven
you
had
left
her
that
time
when
you
wanted
to
farley
was
shocked
alice
had
never
spoken
to
him
like
this
his
arm
quivered
more
than
ever
unable
to
reply
to
her
for
the
moment
he
was
a
rolling
his
astonishment
over
and
over
and
making
it
ready
for
speech
i
hardly
know
how
to
answer
you
alice
i
do
think
there
ever
was
a
time
when
i
could
have
taken
any
joy
which
came
through
a
sacrifice
of
other
people
happiness
i
he
was
confused
by
his
own
words
he
stopped
talking
suddenly
alice
could
feel
that
his
body
was
rigid
against
hers
he
could
not
forgive
her
not
even
when
you
loved
that
wilson
eh
she
remembered
the
name
all
at
once
having
heard
it
long
ago
farley
stopped
still
he
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
his
other
arm
fell
away
from
alice
it
took
him
an
instant
to
answer
her
she
tapped
her
foot
on
the
pavement
the
wind
whizzed
in
their
ears
alice
i
you
are
referring
to
things
too
personal
to
i
ought
to
resent
it
resent
it
i
be
glad
to
see
you
resent
something
she
wanted
him
to
strike
fire
against
her
mother
dullness
he
could
not
bear
her
smile
your
mother
is
a
good
woman
i
suppose
she
is
god
save
us
from
good
women
farley
walked
on
slowly
he
walked
like
an
old
man
it
made
him
feel
tired
when
he
thought
that
anyone
questioned
the
nobility
and
excellence
of
his
resolution
when
you
have
had
more
experience
of
life
alice
you
will
see
how
easily
we
err
and
how
it
always
better
to
accept
the
weight
of
old
burdens
rather
than
assume
new
ones
i
not
likely
to
be
offered
new
ones
what
do
you
mean
what
i
say
ugly
old
maid
at
my
life
will
go
on
like
this
forever
and
ever
farley
was
ashamed
with
alice
because
she
told
the
truth
about
herself
it
hurt
him
to
face
her
ugliness
and
not
be
allowed
to
lie
to
her
that
morbid
talk
he
said
walking
more
slowly
and
rubbing
his
forehead
again
bosh
i
not
morbid
my
life
ends
where
it
began
that
all
the
one
who
makes
me
sick
why
do
you
kick
out
of
this
why
do
you
find
somebody
with
some
who
means
something
to
you
and
go
off
and
be
happy
some
people
may
admire
you
for
all
this
giving
up
your
soul
and
allowing
it
to
be
spit
on
but
i
do
her
heart
was
hard
against
him
it
relieved
her
to
push
her
father
from
her
out
into
life
it
helped
her
to
make
him
live
in
her
stead
large
round
raindrops
pressed
their
foreheads
softly
like
rounded
lips
the
rain
falling
through
the
chill
air
was
warm
i
hardly
think
it
has
been
any
sacrifice
of
my
for
me
to
do
my
duty
toward
your
mother
he
answered
resentfully
they
walked
on
quickly
a
little
apart
alice
was
silent
with
irritation
she
tried
to
fill
her
soul
with
the
calm
of
disgust
but
she
was
feverish
against
his
inertia
farley
felt
himself
misunderstood
alice
had
been
reading
in
bed
it
was
late
at
night
the
room
was
very
still
she
heard
farley
tired
step
on
the
back
stair
coming
up
from
the
kitchen
mamma
alice
called
in
a
sharp
subdued
voice
farley
ambled
slowly
forward
and
leaned
against
the
portal
she
squinted
at
alice
wearily
well
come
in
i
want
to
go
to
bed
early
i
had
so
many
things
to
do
she
entered
the
room
uncertainly
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
her
tired
hands
twitched
a
little
in
her
slack
lap
her
hair
was
untidy
sweat
glistened
on
her
gray
upper
lip
above
her
pale
brown
mouth
when
she
turned
her
head
alice
saw
the
thick
white
down
on
her
cheek
her
glasses
were
on
her
nose
and
behind
them
her
blank
eyes
regarded
her
daughter
stealthily
you
do
seem
to
be
well
alice
i
noticed
how
fidgety
you
been
getting
in
this
heat
i
wish
it
were
only
the
heat
alice
sat
up
and
hugged
her
knees
with
her
big
bare
arms
her
nightgown
was
loose
it
showed
her
heavy
neck
and
the
swell
of
her
large
breast
her
hair
had
slipped
down
and
hung
in
moist
dull
locks
about
her
hard
intent
face
do
you
think
this
operation
winnie
has
to
go
through
with
is
serious
farley
rocked
herself
a
little
her
heel
tapped
the
carpet
restlessly
i
do
know
how
can
you
tell
at
any
rate
her
parents
can
afford
to
give
her
the
best
care
yes
but
that
the
worst
of
it
the
worst
of
it
laurence
ca
bear
to
have
her
take
things
from
them
farley
spoke
in
a
worn
flat
voice
and
rocked
herself
again
how
absurd
oh
he
have
to
let
them
help
there
nothing
else
to
do
i
suppose
that
why
winnie
always
in
hysterics
lately
is
she
my
god
mamma
take
a
little
interest
in
something
tears
of
protest
rose
in
farley
eyes
her
mouth
shook
she
made
an
effort
to
rise
then
sank
back
no
i
take
no
interest
in
anything
but
work
she
said
bitterly
keeping
house
for
you
and
your
father
why
do
you
do
it
then
my
god
you
could
have
stopped
ten
years
ago
seeing
her
mother
eyes
fill
with
tears
alice
own
dry
eyes
felt
a
sudden
coolness
whom
do
you
do
it
for
laurence
and
i
are
old
enough
to
look
out
for
ourselves
farley
shoulders
drooped
and
shivered
she
wagged
her
head
on
her
lean
neck
in
helpless
protest
and
reproach
her
body
rocked
i
suppose
your
father
do
need
me
she
said
scornfully
crudely
wiping
the
sweat
from
her
face
with
her
hand
she
looked
like
a
blind
woman
hearing
alice
from
a
long
way
off
of
course
he
does
need
you
you
ought
to
have
found
that
out
the
time
he
tried
to
get
a
divorce
from
you
alice
mysteriously
urged
to
cruelty
bore
down
upon
her
mother
alice
eyes
glittered
inscrutably
farley
could
not
bear
them
she
stood
at
last
tottering
a
little
her
breath
came
quickly
and
raspingly
hush
i
tell
you
hush
brought
this
up
before
there
something
cruel
in
you
makes
you
want
to
go
over
and
over
things
that
are
done
with
i
suppose
you
think
i
an
interfering
old
maid
i
do
know
what
you
are
and
you
do
want
to
know
alice
sounded
amused
it
was
an
unpleasant
sound
farley
gazing
very
deliberately
at
the
carpet
blew
her
nose
i
never
discussed
my
relation
to
your
father
with
his
children
and
i
not
going
to
now
i
sacrificed
myself
for
what
i
thought
best
and
it
nobody
business
but
my
own
sacrificed
echoed
alice
contemptuously
i
wo
listen
to
you
and
that
all
there
is
to
it
i
never
expected
gratitude
so
i
not
disappointed
farley
not
looking
back
dragged
into
the
hall
alice
lay
still
an
instant
her
expression
one
of
relentless
retrospect
her
eyes
were
enigmatic
but
her
mouth
was
twisted
with
disgust
and
her
nostrils
were
wide
and
tense
she
reached
above
her
head
and
turned
out
the
light
the
curtain
flapped
staccato
fingers
of
rain
tapped
on
the
pane
in
the
room
it
was
dark
the
narrow
dark
the
walls
of
the
room
drew
near
she
felt
herself
pressed
between
them
alice
tossed
from
side
to
side
when
she
lay
quiet
finally
the
darkness
receded
from
her
touched
her
lids
softly
in
passing
death
oh
my
god
i
want
life
she
sat
up
in
bed
holding
her
heavy
breasts
father
a
great
body
unmotivated
alice
hot
will
sought
for
a
world
to
impregnate
mother
who
had
given
birth
meaninglessly
horace
ridge
she
grew
cool
with
despair
desireless
the
hot
sheets
turned
cool
far
away
the
beat
of
rain
on
the
window
under
the
lifted
sash
the
wind
swept
through
the
room
frozen
pain
threads
of
frozen
wonder
embroidering
the
hot
dark
wet
wind
beat
the
soggy
awnings
against
the
glass
a
dank
smell
came
in
it
was
a
cold
august
morning
the
pale
sky
was
filled
with
a
dim
still
light
in
the
the
yellow
shades
half
lowered
strained
the
gloomy
radiance
through
them
and
made
it
a
heavy
orange
the
tablecloth
splattered
with
coffee
stains
like
old
blood
was
overcast
with
trembling
reflections
of
yellow
the
morning
meal
was
over
the
empty
plates
were
scattered
about
smeared
with
hardened
egg
the
half
of
a
muffin
was
mashed
on
the
dingy
carpet
farley
a
little
away
from
the
table
sat
reading
his
paper
farley
was
collecting
the
débris
of
breakfast
her
feeble
hands
moved
among
the
dishes
with
shaken
determination
was
your
egg
fried
enough
she
asked
yes
yes
very
nice
farley
glanced
up
and
gave
his
wife
a
sightless
smile
troubled
by
what
alice
had
said
to
him
he
was
uncomfortable
when
farley
spoke
he
began
to
fold
his
paper
what
he
was
finished
with
he
pushed
out
of
his
mind
into
darkness
alice
had
dragged
his
memories
and
now
the
past
came
up
to
him
like
a
corpse
floating
helen
out
west
she
might
come
east
next
month
he
hoped
not
his
son
place
where
he
sent
money
he
paid
to
be
allowed
to
stop
thinking
about
it
i
worried
about
winnie
i
thought
her
reconciliation
with
her
parents
would
improve
her
frame
of
mind
but
now
she
seems
more
nervous
and
unhappy
than
ever
the
thought
of
that
operation
preys
on
her
mind
well
i
think
she
ought
to
go
out
into
the
country
for
a
rest
before
there
any
more
talk
of
operation
she
thinks
laurence
will
never
be
able
to
forgive
her
if
she
goes
off
with
her
mother
and
father
oh
now
i
think
that
too
bad
she
must
think
things
like
that
about
laurence
farley
talked
kindly
with
a
sort
of
clerical
remoteness
his
lips
smiled
wearily
his
head
was
bent
he
stood
up
farley
picked
up
her
pile
of
dishes
put
the
dishes
between
herself
and
life
the
talk
with
alice
the
night
before
had
made
farley
feel
furtive
do
work
too
hard
farley
walked
out
farley
saw
may
outside
in
the
hall
come
here
may
see
if
you
can
help
me
take
the
plates
to
the
kitchen
may
came
in
glad
to
be
called
her
grandmother
did
not
look
at
her
she
picked
up
a
plate
with
a
cup
on
it
she
walked
into
the
kitchen
taking
careful
steps
the
rim
of
the
plate
held
with
both
hands
pressed
so
tightly
against
her
breast
that
it
cut
the
cup
jiggled
rhythmically
bumping
time
to
may
steps
may
mouth
hung
open
her
face
was
bewildered
with
anxiety
her
breath
came
fast
with
immense
relief
she
reached
the
sink
and
leaning
over
slipped
the
plate
into
it
farley
had
to
talk
to
some
one
she
wanted
to
push
the
trifles
forward
in
her
life
and
crowd
back
the
darkness
filling
it
with
bright
hard
things
baubles
grocerymen
and
dishes
so
she
asked
may
has
our
groceryman
gone
by
here
this
morning
he
promised
to
call
and
exchange
that
condensed
milk
for
evaporated
milk
no
may
said
farley
frowning
her
brows
twitching
looked
at
may
farley
could
not
see
the
little
girl
without
feeling
an
irritable
prompting
to
command
her
go
wash
your
face
and
see
if
your
mother
is
awake
if
she
is
do
rouse
her
do
let
bobby
see
you
or
he
begin
to
clamor
to
get
out
of
bed
may
ran
dutifully
out
do
clatter
up
the
steps
farley
called
sharply
may
walked
very
softly
up
the
creaking
stairs
farley
had
the
soiled
clothes
to
count
she
left
the
dishes
to
soak
and
went
into
the
again
with
the
big
bundle
tied
in
a
sheet
one
two
three
four
she
untied
the
sheet
and
began
to
count
she
could
not
count
fast
enough
she
crammed
her
mind
with
numbers
it
was
like
trying
to
fill
a
slack
sack
to
cover
something
hidden
at
the
bottom
shirts
socks
not
darned
must
darn
today
alice
stockings
alice
is
a
hard
selfish
girl
tablecloths
two
two
murmuring
what
did
i
say
sacrifice
we
must
all
make
sacrifices
the
home
one
two
her
heart
smoldered
damply
in
its
resignation
she
squeezed
love
out
of
her
heart
those
awful
days
ten
years
older
people
one
did
not
know
seemed
to
seek
one
accusingly
in
the
street
furtively
she
recalled
the
birth
of
her
son
remembrance
of
a
strength
that
had
somehow
become
weariness
winnie
in
the
dark
doorway
winnie
appeared
in
a
muslin
dress
she
was
smiling
a
little
wan
her
hair
was
dressed
high
she
looked
plaintive
yet
determined
i
wo
be
sick
and
lie
around
she
said
i
going
to
help
you
work
you
going
to
do
nothing
of
the
sort
you
sit
right
down
here
and
i
give
you
your
breakfast
at
once
did
that
child
wake
you
up
after
all
no
i
was
awake
well
sit
down
oh
mamma
farley
i
want
to
fix
my
own
egg
winnie
protesting
without
conviction
allowed
herself
to
be
pressed
into
a
chair
where
did
you
leave
bobby
he
still
asleep
well
you
had
no
business
to
get
up
winnie
gazed
up
with
sweet
greedy
eyes
i
do
dare
be
sick
any
more
sick
people
are
horrid
nobody
loves
them
winnie
mouth
was
patient
quivering
below
her
lifted
eyes
yes
nobody
loves
them
farley
joked
laboriously
you
dear
winnie
reached
out
and
grasped
farley
hand
eyes
like
brown
bees
crept
with
their
glance
into
the
vague
combative
eyes
before
them
thinking
of
yesterday
talk
winnie
gaze
pierced
the
pongee
blouse
and
the
sagging
black
skirt
and
saw
the
small
form
beneath
winnie
looks
invited
to
pain
as
to
a
bath
of
wine
enjoyed
with
closed
eyes
farley
eyes
filled
with
tears
ugly
and
old
before
winnie
pity
farley
was
a
woman
beaten
back
by
a
lover
she
put
forth
a
smile
that
was
like
a
weak
and
gentle
hand
caressing
an
enemy
bless
you
dear
you
sit
still
while
i
get
your
breakfast
she
walked
out
quickly
when
laurence
came
home
to
dinner
winnie
still
dressed
in
her
best
was
alone
in
the
hello
you
assumed
a
new
rôle
he
said
from
the
doorway
she
could
see
that
finding
her
there
made
him
uncomfortable
she
smiled
at
him
with
a
kind
of
happy
pain
he
came
forward
he
was
kind
and
distant
his
lips
brushed
her
hair
she
gazed
up
at
him
her
eyes
with
crushed
back
lids
and
lifted
lashes
melted
open
for
his
i
do
want
to
be
sick
laurie
i
got
to
go
away
with
mother
you
wo
hate
me
for
going
away
with
her
i
do
need
a
change
so
he
stood
before
her
with
a
kind
of
mocking
fatigue
but
she
saw
that
he
was
sunk
deep
in
himself
she
wanted
to
drag
him
up
he
shook
his
head
i
do
know
what
to
say
to
you
lately
she
reached
up
and
laced
him
with
her
arms
am
i
so
unreasonable
oh
laurie
i
do
want
to
die
he
seated
himself
helplessly
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
why
think
about
something
so
improbable
as
dying
but
i
might
i
want
you
to
care
she
whispered
do
you
think
i
care
his
voice
had
a
grating
note
as
he
tried
to
be
light
of
course
yes
i
guess
so
but
it
so
awful
to
think
about
then
do
think
of
it
i
ca
help
it
death
the
word
had
not
been
alive
to
her
until
this
moment
suddenly
she
heard
it
about
her
whispering
like
wings
she
floated
beyond
laurence
beyond
the
room
with
a
quick
intake
of
breath
she
shut
out
terror
grown
too
delicious
then
you
will
let
me
go
away
with
mother
you
wo
stop
loving
me
laurie
i
shake
you
for
talking
nonsense
he
said
getting
up
she
hated
him
for
escaping
her
but
her
mind
was
made
up
and
the
next
day
when
her
mother
called
the
morning
of
departure
was
set
settling
her
on
her
flat
nose
before
her
fixed
and
despairing
eyes
price
pressed
winnie
face
to
her
flat
black
bosom
i
so
glad
dear
it
was
so
foolish
of
my
little
girl
to
hold
out
against
having
her
parents
do
anything
for
her
your
father
is
so
good
winnie
there
is
nothing
i
can
ask
for
you
that
he
is
willing
to
give
you
must
deprive
him
of
that
pleasure
winnie
thought
of
laurie
and
was
stiff
in
her
mother
embrace
yet
at
that
moment
could
not
have
said
which
of
them
was
most
irritating
price
always
avoided
laurence
name
when
price
had
gone
winnie
lay
in
her
room
on
the
couch
excited
and
oppressed
she
said
death
to
herself
and
the
word
echoed
inside
her
like
a
cry
down
a
long
hall
then
the
echo
was
lost
in
the
deeps
of
darkness
but
it
continued
to
quiver
below
the
surface
of
her
life
winnie
thought
of
being
sick
she
was
harsh
with
a
knowledge
of
herself
she
would
not
be
sick
closing
her
eyes
she
imagined
her
mouth
with
a
kind
of
horror
of
its
own
act
it
pressed
laurence
she
woke
up
the
noonday
sun
outside
was
pale
with
rain
winnie
heard
footsteps
in
the
still
noon
street
death
the
dancing
word
fluttered
ahead
of
the
hurrying
feet
winnie
moved
fretfully
on
the
couch
she
saw
death
as
the
face
of
an
insistent
stranger
thrust
into
her
own
stupid
thing
which
she
did
not
know
she
pushed
it
aside
feebly
feeling
for
what
had
meaning
to
her
laurence
bobby
price
all
at
once
she
realized
that
laurence
had
come
home
for
something
and
was
in
the
room
he
rummaged
at
his
desk
he
was
subdued
in
his
movements
trying
not
to
rouse
her
she
watched
him
between
lids
he
was
familiar
to
her
the
very
crooked
set
of
his
thick
neck
in
his
broad
shoulders
was
food
to
her
hungrily
she
opened
her
eyes
wider
and
lifted
herself
to
her
elbow
what
the
matter
laurie
her
whisper
sharp
and
sweet
pierced
the
somber
stillness
of
the
room
where
the
shades
had
been
drawn
for
her
to
rest
hello
i
came
to
get
a
note
book
did
i
wake
you
he
had
started
at
the
sound
of
his
name
but
as
he
faced
her
he
held
himself
contained
in
his
sharp
cold
smile
i
do
care
i
been
having
horrid
dreams
laurie
that
a
silly
thing
to
do
do
make
fun
of
me
come
sit
by
me
a
minute
i
have
much
time
dear
he
came
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
couch
do
you
want
the
shades
up
it
so
gloomy
i
want
you
first
see
how
cold
my
hands
are
she
gave
him
her
hands
he
took
them
as
though
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
them
his
eyes
were
still
full
of
the
brightness
of
the
street
and
he
could
not
see
her
plainly
i
want
you
to
love
me
oh
laurie
you
do
love
me
she
groped
up
his
arms
his
cheek
until
she
had
found
his
mouth
she
covered
it
up
with
her
hand
she
did
not
want
it
to
speak
against
her
when
he
tried
to
talk
she
pulled
him
down
until
his
eyes
pressed
her
breast
she
drew
him
deeper
into
the
warm
covers
on
the
tumbled
couch
she
was
cold
her
hands
said
that
he
must
warm
her
memories
of
pain
were
silver
veins
in
her
body
twisting
herself
on
the
couch
to
bring
him
nearer
she
wrenched
her
arm
sharp
pang
of
happiness
love
me
she
entreated
her
mouth
clung
against
his
she
could
feel
the
force
of
his
quickening
heart
beats
as
though
they
were
her
own
the
muscles
in
his
arm
twitched
under
the
cloth
of
the
sleeve
which
brushed
her
cheek
her
nostrils
dilated
against
his
arm
the
smell
of
his
body
was
bitter
she
wanted
to
drink
in
the
vividness
of
his
strong
live
flesh
that
resisted
her
around
the
dimmed
squares
of
the
yellow
shades
light
entering
made
shining
borders
noises
drifted
in
the
light
under
the
bright
edges
of
the
yellow
shades
hammering
from
the
house
on
the
corner
reverberated
through
the
room
winnie
i
ca
you
must
you
not
well
enough
you
excite
yourself
like
this
she
felt
him
passive
in
his
resistance
reluctantly
her
arms
slipped
away
her
resentful
eyes
shone
at
him
from
the
gloom
with
a
small
and
pointed
light
he
leaned
away
from
her
patting
her
hair
as
he
came
gradually
to
his
feet
he
did
not
want
to
see
her
because
she
made
him
feel
guilty
toward
himself
then
he
was
obliged
to
look
when
he
smiled
at
her
he
kept
her
outside
his
eyes
he
seemed
relieved
in
spite
of
himself
poor
little
sick
girl
he
said
as
to
a
child
i
glad
you
going
away
with
your
mother
we
give
you
a
nice
rest
and
have
you
all
fixed
up
you
do
love
me
she
said
looking
at
him
stormily
please
winnie
things
are
hard
enough
his
face
was
drawn
with
the
effort
of
his
continued
smile
you
do
she
turned
over
and
closed
her
eyes
do
be
absurd
he
joked
uncomfortably
but
she
would
not
look
at
him
he
walked
out
on
tiptoe
as
though
he
thought
her
asleep
when
she
knew
he
was
gone
she
began
to
cry
and
keeping
her
eyes
closed
moved
her
head
from
side
to
side
and
struck
into
the
pillows
with
her
fist
laurence
did
not
go
home
to
dinner
but
remained
working
at
the
laboratory
until
after
midnight
as
he
walked
home
the
city
streets
washed
thinly
with
light
were
yet
thronged
his
mind
was
sharply
intent
on
itself
it
was
like
the
keel
of
a
ship
parting
the
swarming
life
before
it
but
as
he
drew
nearer
the
place
where
winnie
was
his
heart
strained
he
felt
suffocated
there
were
women
standing
in
doorways
their
shadows
wove
the
darkness
together
and
drew
it
tight
about
his
heart
he
hated
his
work
but
the
doing
of
it
gave
him
relief
for
it
could
not
enter
him
the
glow
from
a
street
lamp
fell
on
his
own
house
walls
that
held
winnie
the
big
gilt
figures
on
the
transom
above
the
door
glistened
on
the
glass
that
gave
back
a
blank
reflection
of
the
light
he
put
in
his
latch
key
the
door
swinging
away
from
him
seemed
drawn
inward
with
the
pull
of
the
darkness
it
shut
ponderously
behind
him
he
hesitated
a
moment
resisting
some
unknown
inevitability
it
was
very
still
in
the
dark
only
the
stairs
were
half
revealed
by
the
pallor
of
the
light
that
came
in
high
up
from
the
street
he
walked
up
softly
and
opened
the
bedroom
door
he
could
hear
a
breath
like
the
respiration
of
shadow
he
knew
it
was
bobby
then
somehow
he
realized
that
winnie
was
awake
and
holding
herself
apart
from
the
dark
he
did
not
speak
she
did
not
speak
he
sat
down
and
began
to
take
off
his
shoes
as
he
laid
the
shoes
away
from
him
he
was
aware
of
her
awareness
as
though
she
were
seeing
him
stoop
forward
in
the
dark
he
had
a
sense
of
his
own
motion
as
a
pale
line
etched
across
a
thick
surface
when
he
unbuckled
his
belt
and
began
to
draw
his
trousers
over
his
feet
he
felt
the
sharp
sweep
of
his
moving
arms
tearing
the
quiescence
of
the
room
he
stood
up
naked
his
cold
toes
gripped
the
hot
nap
of
the
roughened
carpet
he
pulled
on
his
pajamas
and
the
white
cloth
as
it
was
drawn
up
his
legs
was
cool
white
fire
that
burnt
upward
from
his
bare
feet
the
room
seemed
a
final
blackness
into
which
the
dark
of
the
night
outside
had
flowed
and
gathered
as
in
a
pool
still
feeling
himself
burning
white
in
the
cool
cloth
laurence
walked
to
the
side
of
the
bed
and
looked
down
to
see
if
winnie
were
asleep
very
faintly
he
saw
the
rigid
line
of
her
body
but
through
her
nightdress
he
perceived
her
tense
like
a
protest
he
could
not
see
her
eyes
but
he
shivered
with
the
feeling
that
they
were
very
wide
open
and
sightless
the
darkness
was
against
her
eyes
holding
her
rigid
upon
the
white
sheet
in
the
dark
bed
laurie
i
thought
you
were
asleep
he
did
not
know
why
he
lied
she
did
not
answer
at
once
and
he
stood
waiting
laurie
he
felt
suddenly
feverish
in
his
cold
clothes
she
reached
out
and
touched
him
the
feel
of
her
hand
flowed
along
his
hand
and
up
the
veins
of
his
arm
he
felt
as
though
her
hand
had
been
laid
upon
his
heart
his
heart
beat
quickly
he
denied
his
heart
he
was
passive
he
stood
apart
from
himself
he
was
unrelated
to
winnie
sick
and
tense
in
the
bed
laurie
she
whispered
again
she
drew
him
down
beside
her
you
are
sick
winnie
he
said
sure
of
himself
he
did
not
resist
her
she
reached
up
groping
to
cover
his
mouth
it
made
her
angry
when
he
told
her
she
was
sick
she
did
not
want
him
to
build
up
words
between
them
she
tried
to
draw
him
into
herself
into
the
formlessness
of
contact
oh
i
ca
sleep
laurie
i
want
you
to
love
me
i
do
love
you
winnie
if
i
seem
not
to
love
you
it
is
because
you
are
sick
i
not
sick
i
wo
be
sick
you
do
love
me
i
do
please
love
me
i
die
if
you
do
love
me
laurie
he
resisted
her
she
drew
his
hand
to
her
and
placed
it
like
a
cup
over
the
swell
of
her
breast
he
trembled
winnie
my
darling
we
must
laurie
i
go
mad
why
winnie
i
love
you
winnie
but
he
did
not
love
her
she
seemed
to
him
like
a
sickness
they
were
both
sick
with
her
kiss
me
again
he
kissed
her
his
palm
tingled
with
the
strangeness
of
her
breast
i
ca
let
you
go
from
me
laurie
i
do
want
to
she
held
him
suddenly
she
was
no
longer
strange
his
hand
read
the
strangeness
of
her
with
the
relief
of
familiarity
she
burned
him
with
wonder
winnie
felt
him
yield
and
was
glad
but
her
triumph
congealed
in
agony
she
fell
away
from
him
she
was
cold
she
was
still
the
throbbing
of
her
body
came
to
her
like
an
echo
which
she
could
scarcely
hear
she
had
forgotten
the
meaning
of
it
who
was
this
man
she
was
afraid
she
waited
for
him
to
leave
her
laurence
was
tired
with
the
feeling
of
winnie
that
flowed
through
his
body
she
was
in
his
veins
degrading
him
with
possession
if
she
should
have
a
child
he
would
not
think
of
it
he
walked
over
to
the
couch
and
climbed
upon
it
he
would
not
think
driving
his
thoughts
from
him
as
he
lay
down
he
felt
the
flap
of
the
window
shade
and
the
respiration
of
bobby
rattling
in
his
empty
mind
he
tossed
his
body
was
hot
the
sheet
he
pulled
over
him
made
him
shiver
then
he
grew
cold
and
longed
for
the
heat
to
cover
him
up
he
felt
naked
he
wanted
to
lie
drowned
in
heat
miles
thick
in
darkness
winnie
awoke
it
was
morning
the
room
was
cool
and
bright
sunshine
made
the
curtains
glow
patches
of
light
shuddered
delicately
here
and
there
on
the
carpet
a
spear
of
sunshine
shattered
itself
on
the
laurence
slept
on
the
couch
with
one
arm
tossed
up
and
his
head
thrown
back
his
mouth
was
open
his
face
in
sleep
seemed
stupid
with
pain
bobby
slept
too
stirring
and
murmuring
a
little
winnie
found
something
oppressive
in
the
sight
of
people
yet
asleep
like
this
in
the
full
blaze
of
the
sun
winnie
mind
was
clear
and
calm
with
the
ease
that
came
of
sleep
but
in
the
center
of
her
being
there
was
a
dark
spot
of
indecipherable
vividness
last
night
a
dark
spot
of
terror
laurence
had
been
frightened
by
what
they
had
done
she
wanted
him
to
be
frightened
death
if
she
had
a
child
she
would
suffer
not
he
white
and
holy
she
felt
herself
a
beautiful
stillness
in
the
turmoil
of
cowardice
she
could
not
part
with
this
fear
if
she
had
a
child
death
was
her
hand
from
which
he
could
not
escape
midnight
the
street
lamps
shone
into
the
bedroom
making
bright
shadows
of
the
drawn
shades
the
bureau
the
bed
bits
of
furniture
here
and
there
darker
than
the
darkness
reflected
the
light
heavily
laurence
stood
outside
the
door
in
the
hall
he
was
trembling
afraid
of
his
own
room
he
had
stayed
away
all
day
because
he
could
not
see
winnie
because
he
hoped
that
when
he
reached
home
she
would
be
asleep
it
was
quiet
he
opened
the
door
and
stepped
inside
the
sudden
draught
lifted
the
shades
ponderously
and
let
them
drop
again
fresh
clean
wind
from
the
quiet
midnight
street
surged
into
the
room
light
floated
in
under
the
lifted
shades
it
seemed
as
if
the
wind
cold
and
shining
were
washing
away
the
darkness
winnie
was
awake
again
laurence
stood
still
he
waited
a
long
time
he
felt
shaken
if
i
take
her
again
she
will
die
he
did
not
believe
it
he
went
toward
her
with
a
nausea
of
relief
die
was
the
word
of
a
song
it
was
the
strange
music
of
passion
that
said
die
he
waited
by
the
bed
he
wanted
her
to
tell
him
to
go
away
he
could
feel
her
still
and
looking
at
him
when
he
knelt
by
the
bed
and
reached
his
arms
around
her
he
wanted
her
to
evade
him
winnie
she
trembled
when
he
touched
her
he
wanted
her
to
speak
but
she
was
quiet
she
let
him
kiss
her
mouth
death
his
understanding
could
not
hold
the
vagueness
of
the
strange
escaping
word
he
felt
her
thinning
from
his
grasp
his
veins
swelled
with
death
then
he
became
the
glad
in
spite
of
himself
of
the
drunkenness
of
moving
with
the
unseen
through
the
banality
of
sex
which
oppressed
him
there
pushed
the
will
of
an
exalted
and
passionate
horror
he
took
her
they
were
dead
winnie
lay
face
downward
and
sobbed
there
was
no
triumph
in
her
now
she
felt
herself
as
if
already
large
with
child
heavy
and
helpless
through
the
darkness
of
her
closed
lids
she
could
see
as
if
before
her
laurence
coarse
and
handsome
head
his
eyes
turned
toward
her
with
their
strained
gaze
and
the
odd
set
of
his
neck
that
kept
his
face
always
a
little
to
one
side
she
knew
now
how
much
she
hated
him
laurence
walking
along
the
deserted
streets
was
relieved
to
find
the
long
vistas
ending
in
darkness
the
night
rose
high
and
expressionless
before
him
beyond
the
dim
lights
the
horizon
was
a
clear
quiet
stretch
like
a
lake
of
glass
covered
with
flowering
stars
his
pain
was
choked
in
him
suffocated
by
the
quiet
his
mind
was
sick
yet
with
winnie
sickness
but
the
pain
of
her
no
longer
belonged
to
him
he
wondered
if
she
would
have
a
child
if
he
had
killed
her
but
the
agony
of
his
conjecture
related
to
something
already
finished
she
had
made
him
love
her
against
them
both
he
did
not
want
love
like
that
it
could
never
be
otherwise
they
were
separated
from
each
other
by
their
own
bodies
part
ii
as
farley
walked
home
from
business
he
had
a
troubled
look
when
he
came
into
his
own
street
he
scarcely
seemed
aware
of
his
whereabouts
for
several
days
he
had
been
restless
and
ill
at
ease
with
himself
his
resentment
toward
alice
was
blunted
and
dispersed
by
his
determination
to
think
well
of
the
world
he
needed
this
charity
to
think
well
of
himself
what
disturbed
and
depressed
him
most
was
her
forcible
suggestion
of
incompleteness
in
things
which
he
had
looked
upon
as
finished
he
went
up
the
steps
there
was
a
kansas
city
newspaper
in
the
box
it
hurt
him
to
take
it
out
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
when
he
opened
the
front
door
and
stepped
into
the
empty
hall
the
first
look
of
the
place
pained
him
with
its
harsh
familiarity
but
when
he
had
laid
his
hat
down
he
passed
on
into
the
and
seated
himself
in
one
of
the
old
chairs
and
his
antagonism
and
desire
to
exist
in
separateness
melted
in
the
faintly
bitter
sense
of
inevitability
which
he
experienced
the
old
house
with
the
low
ceilings
and
broad
stone
mantelpieces
and
the
walls
hung
in
stained
dark
figured
papers
just
as
he
had
bought
it
with
the
first
savings
of
his
married
life
represented
the
known
asserting
him
through
his
identity
with
it
he
leaned
forward
closing
his
eyes
and
pinching
his
lids
together
between
his
thumbs
and
forefingers
farley
had
heard
him
come
she
could
not
keep
away
when
she
entered
the
room
however
she
pretended
to
be
surprised
i
oh
i
did
hear
you
i
came
for
a
dust
cloth
winnie
has
gone
out
in
the
price
carriage
to
do
some
shopping
farley
scattered
her
words
before
her
as
a
cuttlefish
throws
out
its
vaguely
disguising
substance
farley
lifted
his
head
with
a
heavy
patient
smile
but
she
would
not
look
at
him
well
well
i
thought
that
dust
cloth
was
here
she
fumbled
among
the
chairs
she
was
very
and
intent
she
saw
that
he
was
depressed
and
it
made
her
uneasy
farley
could
see
her
profile
her
lined
withered
lips
her
dry
finely
wrinkled
skin
which
was
a
thin
film
of
disguise
over
her
melting
flesh
the
expression
of
nervous
good
humor
in
her
evasive
eyes
was
like
a
gauze
scarf
laid
over
a
spectacle
of
horror
the
two
people
afraid
of
their
fear
of
each
other
were
like
alien
creatures
haltered
with
one
chain
can
i
help
you
farley
asked
no
no
alice
has
come
home
has
she
as
far
as
i
know
she
has
shall
i
send
her
to
you
when
she
comes
no
that
all
right
that
all
right
farley
hurried
out
she
went
into
the
a
last
streak
of
sunshine
filtered
through
the
clouds
and
came
over
the
back
yard
into
the
room
there
were
some
tumblers
in
a
tray
on
the
sideboard
that
caught
the
specks
of
light
that
were
like
bubbles
of
fire
in
the
colorless
glass
each
day
the
sun
touched
the
same
spots
with
the
same
light
there
was
assurance
and
finality
in
the
undeviating
rays
of
the
tired
sun
farley
felt
quiet
among
the
chairs
and
tables
she
saw
some
lint
on
the
ragged
carpet
and
stooped
to
pick
it
off
she
craved
intimacy
with
the
still
things
her
touch
could
dominate
they
enlarged
her
and
she
was
afraid
of
those
who
would
speak
some
terrible
word
of
love
or
money
to
destroy
their
permanence
when
she
went
to
the
sideboard
and
opened
the
drawer
in
which
the
tablecloths
were
kept
her
furtive
thoughts
slipped
between
the
linen
and
as
her
hands
moved
over
it
the
cool
glazed
feel
of
the
starched
fabric
was
a
denial
of
change
and
heat
in
the
farley
leaned
back
in
his
chair
again
his
eyes
half
closed
in
his
low
chair
his
gaze
was
on
a
level
with
the
polished
top
of
the
table
glazed
silverish
with
the
dimming
light
the
arms
of
the
imitation
mahogany
rocker
were
as
bright
and
enigmatic
as
glass
some
pictures
on
the
wall
were
indecipherable
beneath
streaked
reflections
an
old
painting
of
lake
lucerne
hung
over
the
mantel
shelf
the
pigment
was
faded
and
the
canvas
was
seamed
with
fine
irregular
cracks
when
farley
glanced
upward
at
this
picture
he
experienced
a
voluptuous
sense
of
futility
he
stared
at
it
a
long
time
but
the
spell
of
inertia
did
not
last
he
became
uneasy
again
he
was
afraid
his
wife
might
come
back
so
he
walked
across
the
hall
to
the
disorderly
little
room
that
was
called
his
study
there
were
a
desk
and
a
leather
lounge
with
protruding
springs
and
on
the
walls
two
or
three
old
advertising
calendars
decorated
with
hunting
scenes
or
pictures
of
setter
dogs
farley
sat
down
before
the
littered
desk
and
began
his
letter
dear
helen
he
wrote
to
her
about
his
regard
for
her
and
their
mutual
sense
of
responsibility
toward
their
son
and
he
wanted
to
say
something
else
but
when
he
attempted
to
recall
more
intimate
phrases
it
revived
his
sense
of
sin
he
felt
embarrassed
and
gave
it
up
it
was
seven
in
the
evening
the
sun
had
gone
the
sky
at
the
zenith
was
pale
but
along
the
horizon
the
clouds
glowed
with
pink
from
the
city
light
had
receded
like
a
tide
and
rows
of
housetops
on
the
length
of
the
sky
were
like
objects
left
there
by
a
departing
sea
they
were
separate
and
waited
as
darkness
gathered
it
gathered
first
in
the
house
fronts
like
an
added
heaviness
above
the
houses
the
sky
floated
higher
paler
the
sky
dilated
and
soared
then
the
shining
pallor
grew
dim
the
sky
sent
itself
down
in
grayness
to
the
dark
streets
where
the
lamp
lights
floated
in
the
dust
as
in
clouds
of
ash
the
house
fronts
flaked
with
light
disintegrated
in
the
general
vagueness
horace
ridge
was
ready
to
depart
on
his
last
night
before
sailing
he
had
sent
for
alice
to
help
him
finish
some
work
she
passed
out
of
the
twilight
into
the
tiled
corridor
of
the
building
in
which
he
lived
the
marble
walls
wavered
in
light
lights
clustered
above
the
wainscot
stabbed
her
eyes
a
sleepy
hallboy
in
a
tan
uniform
vacantly
watched
her
approach
she
ignored
the
elevators
and
walked
up
the
one
flight
of
stairs
and
along
the
brown
velvet
carpet
to
the
door
she
wanted
when
she
rang
the
small
bell
under
the
brass
plate
she
heard
the
tinkle
in
the
depths
of
her
being
sharp
like
a
light
moving
under
deep
water
so
keen
was
her
perception
of
his
coming
that
she
was
not
conscious
of
separate
incidents
footsteps
the
sigh
of
the
opening
door
but
in
one
act
he
was
there
in
the
place
where
she
had
expected
him
he
held
a
hand
over
his
eyes
that
were
guarded
with
a
green
shade
miss
alice
i
merciless
these
days
must
get
something
done
while
the
doing
of
it
is
in
me
he
smiled
with
his
mouth
his
eyes
mysterious
out
of
sight
you
merciless
to
yourself
we
all
know
that
alice
said
he
walked
after
her
into
the
library
without
seeing
him
she
was
aware
of
the
uncertainty
of
his
tired
steps
she
was
ashamed
of
her
deep
consciousness
of
his
hesitation
knowing
that
he
tried
to
conceal
his
half
gestures
from
her
he
sat
down
rather
heavily
and
she
stood
in
the
center
of
the
room
unpinning
her
hat
i
would
like
to
have
taken
you
for
a
lark
on
my
last
night
instead
of
setting
you
to
work
you
be
glad
to
forget
about
me
his
mouth
still
smiled
and
his
big
hand
moved
up
to
his
eyes
under
the
shade
alice
did
not
answer
then
she
said
are
you
sure
you
feel
well
enough
to
work
she
had
the
brusque
presumptuous
manner
which
she
knew
he
tolerated
the
old
dog
has
a
lot
of
fight
in
him
yet
you
must
draw
too
many
conclusions
from
appearances
the
big
room
with
the
high
shelves
was
gloomy
in
candle
light
these
esthetic
shadows
will
spoil
your
eyes
you
better
get
that
student
lamp
down
he
said
alice
walked
briskly
to
a
stand
in
the
corner
and
took
down
the
light
she
carried
it
over
to
his
table
you
better
move
it
shines
there
it
hurt
her
to
tell
him
what
to
do
i
sit
with
my
back
to
it
alice
pushed
a
heap
of
books
aside
and
arranged
the
green
cord
attachment
over
the
crowded
table
blindness
better
after
all
he
ca
see
me
she
thought
bitterly
she
sat
down
with
her
writing
pad
in
her
lap
he
rubbed
his
forehead
wearily
his
shoulders
sagged
big
beneath
his
loose
coat
there
was
passive
strength
in
his
consciousness
of
defeat
she
was
aware
of
it
the
room
closed
them
like
a
coffin
their
life
was
their
own
it
did
not
flow
in
from
the
street
beyond
the
window
the
square
was
sprinkled
with
lights
the
trees
were
clouds
of
darkness
but
here
and
there
separate
leaves
up
against
the
lamps
glistened
like
wet
metal
he
sighed
i
trying
to
line
up
my
vocabulary
in
battle
order
miss
alice
i
ready
go
ahead
he
did
not
begin
at
once
she
watched
his
bowed
head
thick
brown
hair
there
was
beard
on
his
cheek
suddenly
she
had
a
horror
of
herself
creeping
upon
his
thoughts
through
his
weakness
she
shuddered
shifting
her
book
dark
flesh
aware
of
the
world
slipping
away
flesh
touched
by
the
world
without
as
regards
the
international
polity
of
the
she
interrupted
say
that
again
mr
ridge
he
had
dictated
several
sentences
and
she
had
not
heard
him
since
the
she
began
to
write
the
wind
fluttered
the
paper
on
her
knee
her
hands
with
big
knuckles
moved
decisively
over
the
sheet
i
wearing
you
out
bother
you
not
he
liked
her
positiveness
a
half
a
paragraph
or
so
and
i
will
have
reached
the
end
of
my
tether
go
ahead
when
he
had
finished
he
leaned
back
turning
himself
so
that
he
could
look
at
her
and
she
could
tell
by
his
mouth
that
he
was
happier
i
taxed
your
patience
have
any
patience
alice
said
making
a
wry
face
she
wanted
to
cry
she
stood
up
i
have
this
all
typed
by
tomorrow
afternoon
when
does
the
boat
sail
ten
tomorrow
night
they
were
silent
he
still
smiled
his
blunt
fingers
tapping
the
arm
of
his
chair
but
the
corners
of
his
full
lips
sagged
with
fatigue
under
the
stiff
edges
of
his
mustache
and
he
was
pale
alice
got
her
hat
down
from
the
shelf
you
need
some
one
to
take
care
of
you
she
said
trying
to
sound
angry
she
was
afraid
her
words
hurt
him
her
heart
beat
very
fast
young
harrison
is
going
along
to
keep
me
from
walking
overboard
in
an
absent
moment
they
were
quiet
again
alice
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
go
out
the
trees
in
the
square
seemed
to
have
crowded
closer
against
the
open
windows
the
leaves
looked
like
tin
in
the
auras
of
light
she
stared
into
the
street
that
had
grown
still
well
if
i
do
get
down
to
the
boat
i
send
somebody
she
held
out
her
hand
he
stood
up
being
so
big
he
looked
more
helpless
behind
his
shade
he
took
her
hand
and
held
it
in
both
his
god
bless
you
miss
alice
she
could
not
speak
he
saw
that
she
was
disturbed
he
was
kind
a
big
stout
man
smiling
her
throat
closed
take
a
real
rest
she
ordered
in
a
short
thick
voice
their
hands
dropped
apart
i
probably
be
forced
to
in
spite
of
myself
well
i
glad
of
it
she
turned
quickly
and
went
toward
the
door
he
followed
her
and
stumbled
a
little
she
tried
not
to
look
back
at
him
this
has
been
awfully
good
of
you
he
said
after
her
in
his
slow
kind
way
she
could
not
bear
his
slow
kindness
she
did
not
answer
ca
i
get
a
taxicab
for
you
could
feel
uncomfortable
with
such
luxuries
you
go
to
bed
and
rest
she
glanced
back
once
he
stood
huge
in
his
fatigue
with
his
drooped
gentle
mouth
in
an
attitude
as
if
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
his
hands
she
bit
her
lips
the
door
closed
she
was
in
the
corridor
stupid
with
light
on
the
stairs
she
met
the
hallboy
who
stood
aside
he
had
a
vacant
gaze
as
if
the
empty
brilliance
of
the
hall
had
dizzied
him
when
she
passed
into
the
still
street
she
felt
as
though
she
slipped
into
an
inner
darkness
she
was
two
and
the
self
that
suffered
heavy
and
dark
sank
through
an
oblivious
other
and
out
of
knowledge
i
can
not
bear
it
she
went
through
the
park
there
were
people
on
the
benches
in
the
darkness
she
walked
quickly
past
them
into
the
circles
under
the
lamps
what
shall
i
do
lies
i
think
i
going
mad
she
went
on
her
heels
clicked
on
the
deserted
street
against
the
window
of
a
house
she
passed
a
lamp
with
a
red
shade
glowed
softly
the
new
moon
over
the
trees
was
like
a
fragment
of
ice
what
does
it
come
to
sheep
wag
wag
tail
mistress
mary
far
away
over
the
hills
the
street
dark
over
the
hills
dark
darkness
is
one
there
are
no
eyes
in
the
dark
horace
walking
she
pressed
her
knuckles
against
her
lips
and
dug
her
teeth
into
the
flesh
sweet
to
feel
softly
her
agony
flowed
through
the
wound
of
her
teeth
when
she
reached
home
she
passed
quickly
through
the
dimly
lit
hallway
and
so
up
the
long
stairs
escaping
notice
the
hinges
creaked
as
she
opened
the
door
of
her
dark
room
she
went
in
quickly
and
closed
it
and
rested
against
the
lintel
panting
her
head
thrown
back
her
mind
was
fire
and
ice
she
must
kill
this
agony
a
little
light
floated
in
from
the
street
through
the
open
window
she
could
see
her
bureau
with
its
white
cover
and
the
sparkle
of
toilet
instruments
on
it
she
went
there
and
picked
up
a
pair
of
scissors
plunging
the
points
twice
into
her
flesh
with
quick
stabs
feeling
numbness
and
relief
she
stood
stupidly
watching
the
blood
dark
and
colorless
gather
on
her
forearm
mary
had
a
little
lamb
i
mad
washed
in
the
blood
of
the
lamb
she
sank
to
her
knees
then
relaxed
on
the
floor
in
a
half
sitting
posture
her
head
thrown
back
against
the
bed
her
hat
awry
one
hand
holding
the
ache
of
her
bleeding
wrist
the
glow
from
the
street
lamp
bewildering
her
eyes
price
gruff
and
solemn
tried
to
hasten
the
departure
well
winifred
you
ready
his
smoky
eyes
were
everywhere
and
on
no
one
he
waved
the
hand
that
held
his
hat
winnie
had
on
a
new
cloak
and
a
pretty
little
blue
straw
turban
laurie
will
be
angry
when
he
sees
mother

been
buying
me
clothes
bobby
bobby
my
darling
she
hugged
him
to
her
trying
to
wring
from
him
some
assurance
that
she
would
be
with
him
when
she
was
gone
allowing
himself
to
be
kissed
he
stirred
an
instant
and
was
calm
he
was
water
broad
and
profound
winnie
felt
herself
sinking
into
his
passive
depths
oh
bobby
you
hurts
my
arm
she
drew
away
from
him
and
felt
part
of
her
still
there
lost
in
his
passive
clearness
you
wo
forget
mamma
mamma
farley

help
you

his
hair
with
taut
wistful
gestures
winnie
cheeks
were
bright
price

on
a
trim
black
traveling
suit
of
handsome
cloth
and
a
simple
but
distinguished
hat
very
precisely
worn
is
laurie
upstairs
mamma
farley
farley
looked
up
abstracted
she
dangled
in
the
general
emotion
like
a
puppet
suspended
over
a
torrent
swayed
but
unmoved
i
think
so
dear
she
tried
not
to
see
price
so
like
herself
but
lifted
up
by
social
confidence
i
going
up
to
see
him
all
right
dear
nine
price
said
sternly
taking
out
his
watch
and
looking
at
it
with
an
air
of
reprimand
just
a
moment
father
winnie
ran
up
the
long
dingy
stairs
to
the
door
of
her
room
it
was
open
and
before
she
entered
she
saw
laurence
standing
in
the
confusion
of
packing
which
she
had
left
and
looking
at
a
book
when
she
stood
beside
him
he
glanced
up
carefully
his
lips
were
drawn
she
thought
he
smiled
at
her
as
if
she
were
a
stranger
off
she
was
breathing
quickly
her
eyes
shining
at
him
reproachfully
through
her
fluff
of
hair
under
the
new
hat
the
gas
light
to
one
side
made
his
hair
glossy
and
threw
shadows
in
the
hollows
of
his
cheeks
are
you
going
to
the
train
laurie
do
you
think
the
family
will
be
happier
if
i
am
not
there
to
spoil
the
rapport
of
departure
smiling
he
stared
at
her
with
his
hard
pained
eyes
she
had
the
feeling
that
he
was
a
long
way
off
she
felt
sorry
for
herself
oh
laurie
please
have
some
pity
for
me
do
be
nasty
tonight
it
pity
for
you
that
keeps
me
here
my
dear
girl
she
could
not
speak
death
i
may
be
pregnant
a
sharp
small
fear
bit
her
breast
with
its
teeth
because
she
was
hurt
inside
she
despised
his
ignorance
she
wanted
to
poison
his
calm
with
her
fear
but
the
triumph
of
injury
was
sweet
to
her
she
held
it
close
you
be
glad
now
she
was
trembling
glad
of
what
dear
girl
that
i
gone
winnie
please
not
tonight
he
gazed
straight
at
her
his
smiling
patience
was
too
bitter
her
pride
could
not
forgive
him
tears
of
shame
and
hate
rose
to
her
eyes
you
do
love
me
any
more
i
know
that
he
would
not
look
at
her
turning
over
the
leaves
of
the
book
his
small
hand
shook
its
whiteness
and
delicacy
irritated
her
oh
laurie
i
ca
go
away
angry
she
put
her
hand
on
his
sleeve
the
roughness
and
realness
of
his
sleeve
hurt
her
hand
she
did
not
want
it
without
looking
up
he
reached
an
arm
around
her
have
you
talked
to
the
doctor
winnie
he
could
not
look
at
her
yes
she
whispered
lying
when
she
lied
she
blamed
him
more
are
you
sure
you
all
right
winnie
he
forced
out
the
words
very
deliberately
they
were
like
stones
to
his
lips
she
hesitated
an
instant
then
she
said
yes
kiss
me
oh
laurie
so
awful
i
it
so
awful
i
he
put
the
book
down
and
faced
her
in
her
embrace
she
thought
he
seemed
calm
and
satisfied
as
though
the
doctor
had
become
proxy
for
his
conscience
winnie
eyes
fiercely
soft
stared
into
his
and
made
him
feel
furtive
and
depressed
he
kissed
her
to
keep
from
looking
at
her
when
their
mouths
were
together
his
cruelty
made
her
strong
she
forgave
him
he
was
a
dark
thing
close
to
her
smothering
her
with
his
breath
his
clothed
body
dissolved
in
her
immediate
recognition
of
his
flesh
and
she
had
a
sickish
sensation
as
of
life
stirring
in
her
shamelessly
kind
and
unmoved
he
had
believed
this
impossible
thing
she
moved
away
from
him
in
spite
of
herself
and
with
a
pang
she
felt
how
his
hand
dropped
away
in
relief
that
she
did
not
want
it
she
would
not
go
away
you
do
love
me
please
do
let
us
torture
each
other
winnie
you
are
going
away
to
get
well
suppose
i
should
die
laurence
but
you
wo
die
again
he
drew
her
uncomfortably
to
him
his
head
throbbed
he
tried
to
give
her
what
she
wanted
her
shuddering
lips
moved
over
his
face
and
he
drooped
helplessly
under
them
like
a
beast
in
the
rain
he
tried
to
love
her
she
hated
him
so
that
she
could
not
bear
to
have
him
go
away
from
her
death
she
tried
to
keep
that
word
in
her
it
was
a
child
she
had
conceived
to
which
she
refused
birth
she
wanted
to
carry
death
dead
in
her
if
anything
terrible
happens
if
i
have
to
be
operated
on
her
words
stumbled
but
nothing
will
happen
you
nervous
winnie
you
all
nervous
and
sick
this
stay
in
the
country
will
make
you
over
and
you
be
glad
to
see
me
well
again
she
leaned
back
from
him
searching
his
set
kind
face
with
her
tearful
eyes
of
course
my
dear
girl
of
course
winnie
alice
called
i
coming
winnie
gave
him
another
swift
little
bitter
kiss
and
slipped
from
his
arms
as
she
went
out
she
glanced
back
smiling
and
pathetic
he
hurt
her
and
she
wanted
to
remind
him
how
pretty
she
was
she
was
small
and
light
with
dread
his
being
composed
itself
in
darkness
and
peace
but
his
composure
was
an
ache
blank
and
broad
above
the
housetops
huge
masses
of
cloud
smutted
like
torrents
of
snow
moved
steadily
surf
of
a
gigantic
tide
sweeping
the
stillness
of
the
far
vacant
sky
it
was
noonday
alice
passed
briskly
up
the
steps
and
opened
the
dusty
front
door
mamma
farley
was
in
the
behind
drawn
shades
she
did
not
answer
when
she
heard
alice
heavy
footsteps
she
shivered
alice
came
to
the
door
and
looked
in
her
mother
squinted
at
her
bewilderedly
then
glanced
away
you
still
here
are
you
i
been
down
and
finished
up
the
business
ridge
left
me
to
do
farley
rose
wearily
as
if
driven
her
knees
were
slack
under
her
trailing
skirt
her
posture
sagged
i
should
have
started
the
children
lunch
she
said
i
start
the
children
lunch
but
it
is
foolish
for
you
to
sit
moping
here
moping
farley
scoffed
her
throat
shook
she
gulped
and
her
thin
neck
showed
a
corded
undulation
along
its
length
well
what
if
you
did
see
that
papa
had
a
telegram
from
wilson
what
of
it
is
it
anything
new
farley
tight
mouth
puckered
along
the
edges
like
fruit
left
too
long
in
the
sun
she
stared
resentfully
at
alice
new
farley
interrogated
alice
took
off
her
hat
and
whirled
it
in
her
hand
i
do
see
why
the
fact
that
she
happens
to
be
passing
through
town
makes
the
situation
between
you
and
papa
worse
than
it
is
all
the
time
you
know
the
relation
between
them
it
gone
on
for
twelve
years
now
she
probably
thinks
her
claim
on
him
is
just
as
good
as
yours
for
a
moment
the
hard
center
of
farley
vision
dissolved
in
unshed
tears
and
she
saw
alice
far
off
as
in
a
vision
of
the
dying
why
do
you
quit
this
thing
if
you
do
like
it
alice
went
on
you
can
come
and
live
with
me
and
leave
papa
to
do
what
he
pleases
then
farley
face
went
hard
again
with
malice
and
fear
and
her
brow
flushed
with
a
streak
like
a
whiplash
her
fingers
had
short
blunt
yellowish
nails
flecked
with
white
her
hands
made
impotent
gestures
she
was
like
a
sheep
searching
for
a
gate
when
she
must
leap
over
a
wall
it
evident
how
little
you
understand
your
father
she
said
defiantly
alice
gave
a
disagreeable
laugh
she
felt
herself
building
her
world
sound
like
her
own
upon
ramparts
of
pain
your
father
has
always
felt
that
he
had
to
make
atonement
for
what
he
did
that
no
matter
what
kind
of
a
woman
wilson
was
that
she
farley
could
not
go
on
well
he
did
have
a
child
by
her
because
he
preferred
you
farley
whole
face
trembled
with
her
sense
of
outrage
and
impotence
her
eyes
squinting
a
little
were
those
of
a
creature
who
takes
no
pride
in
its
rage
whatever
you
say
i
ca
forget
my
duty
to
your
father
i
wish
you
had
never
heard
of
this
you
a
coarse
cold
woman
alice
alice
smiled
glad
her
mother
had
hurt
her
yes
you
told
me
that
before
they
faced
each
other
farley
trying
to
speak
but
unable
alice
saw
how
ugly
her
mother
was
and
was
ashamed
of
seeing
it
farley
turned
her
head
a
little
and
there
were
spiked
wisps
of
hair
clinging
on
the
nape
of
her
scrawny
freckled
neck
let
me
go
out
farley
said
stumbling
suddenly
toward
the
door
in
a
blind
gesture
of
protest
and
escape
i
not
keeping
you
alice
said
everything
would
be
well
enough
if
you
were
bent
on
persecuting
me
farley
called
back
alice
was
very
calm
i
not
persecuting
you
if
you
really
prefer
to
go
on
this
way
tied
like
a
millstone
about
papa
neck
it
is
your
own
affair
i
suppose
though
i
ca
help
protesting
when
i
see
it
farley
was
gone
alice
felt
a
kind
of
hysterical
relief
in
her
mother
exit
it
was
a
cool
delicate
morning
the
curtains
swung
in
the
opened
windows
before
the
cool
darkened
room
the
iron
rails
along
the
area
made
light
black
embroideries
of
shadow
among
blobs
and
flecks
of
gold
on
the
basement
front
even
the
tap
of
hoofs
in
the
street
sounded
as
though
the
horses
trod
in
hesitation
in
farley
light
shivered
against
the
edges
of
knives
and
forks
laid
on
the
clean
cloth
and
flew
off
in
sparks
laurence
had
gone
but
farley
and
alice
had
just
seated
themselves
at
table
farley
was
more
abstracted
and
uncomfortable
than
usual
is
your
mother
well
alice
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
she
sat
down
and
last
night
she
scarcely
ate
anything
i
hate
to
see
her
spend
so
much
time
in
the
kitchen
she
saw
the
telegram
you
dropped
yesterday
morning
alice
said
farley
flushed
and
fine
lines
came
between
his
eyes
but
before
he
could
say
what
hovered
on
his
lips
farley
came
in
and
he
was
silent
farley
arms
were
limp
with
the
weight
of
the
tray
she
carried
her
fingers
clutched
at
the
edges
there
was
something
exasperating
in
her
manner
that
suggested
the
senseless
tremor
of
frightened
wings
her
hands
were
unsteady
and
some
of
the
contents
of
the
coffee
urn
splashed
on
her
wrist
alice
got
up
give
me
that
tray
she
took
it
firmly
now
you
sit
down
and
eat
i
i
had
something
to
eat
farley
said
weakly
at
the
same
time
sitting
down
farley
glanced
at
her
but
looked
away
quickly
he
could
not
bear
to
see
her
fear
which
was
like
a
fear
of
him
he
cleared
his
throat
are
you
feeling
well
mother
alice
kept
a
rigorous
gaze
full
of
cruel
pity
steadily
upon
her
face
why
yes
i
she
turned
to
alice
i
have
so
much
to
do
alice
i
ca
as
she
assisted
herself
to
her
feet
her
flabby
grip
fell
from
the
edge
of
the
table
she
swayed
a
little
i
left
the
oven
on
you
sit
down
alice
tried
to
push
her
back
no
no
i
must
turn
it
off
she
brushed
by
and
left
alice
looking
after
her
farley
tried
to
be
elaborately
unmindful
of
and
he
pretended
not
to
see
his
wife
wearily
bowed
head
and
the
palsied
tremor
of
her
thin
neck
as
she
went
out
her
shoulders
rounded
her
knees
loose
her
head
thrust
forward
her
feet
dragging
the
carpet
she
left
vividly
the
impression
of
her
very
thin
neck
taut
and
elongated
like
the
neck
of
a
goose
when
it
attempts
flight
she
held
her
sharp
elbows
at
right
angles
to
her
sides
with
the
same
rigid
anticipation
of
haste
has
has
farley
could
not
bear
to
confess
to
the
actuality
could
you
let
her
rest
for
a
week
alice
you
do
expect
to
get
another
position
at
once
as
long
as
you
are
at
home
it
seems
to
me
that
you
and
i
could
combine
to
keep
the
house
going
and
let
her
off
she
would
do
it
pottering
around
consoles
her
more
than
anything
else
there
was
silence
farley
gulped
his
coffee
his
face
remained
flushed
and
there
were
tears
of
discomfort
in
his
eyes
know
what
the
matter
with
mamma
father
alice
subdued
voice
sounded
to
him
almost
threatening
farley
gazed
at
his
daughter
helplessly
why
no
i
no
he
looked
so
much
like
a
startled
baby
that
alice
wanted
to
laugh
she
knows
wilson
is
in
town
and
farley
interrupted
hurriedly
but
my
dear
child
i
i
he
moved
his
knife
and
fork
nervously
about
alice
felt
strong
her
frankness
gave
her
the
relief
which
the
maniac
feels
in
his
cruelty
when
he
touches
flesh
and
it
responds
to
him
with
sentience
do
think
i
do
understand
your
situation
father
i
do
i
simply
trying
to
look
at
it
from
mamma
standpoint
he
glanced
up
their
eyes
met
alice
had
swung
back
on
the
two
rear
legs
of
her
chair
her
coarse
hand
on
the
edge
of
the
table
holding
her
steady
her
eyes
were
excited
her
mouth
harsh
with
determination
to
make
him
feel
she
longed
for
that
sympathetic
quiver
darkness
behind
her
thoughts
two
sharp
strokes
from
the
scissors
let
out
the
clotted
honey
of
pain
too
sweet
for
the
veins
mamma
does
really
love
you
any
more
than
you
love
her
papa
farley
glanced
nervously
toward
the
kitchen
door
his
features
suddenly
relaxed
in
the
flaccidness
of
his
eyes
shone
dimly
i
do
think
you
realize
the
true
satisfaction
there
is
in
duty
well
done
alice
he
said
shakily
things
may
be
this
is
no
place
to
to
discuss
details
but
i
would
not
knowingly
hurt
your
mother
for
anything
on
earth
alice
watched
him
narrowly
and
saw
him
loving
himself
in
his
tears
i
did
suppose
you
have
the
courage
to
go
out
and
commit
murder
if
that
what
you
mean
she
said
sharply
her
chair
bumped
against
the
floor
and
she
stood
up
farley
was
desperate
there
is
more
than
one
kind
of
perfectly
genuine
affection
his
voice
was
unsteady
he
drew
lines
and
cross
lines
on
the
table
cloth
with
his
knife
alice
laughed
and
tapped
her
foot
on
the
floor
he
was
hurt
by
her
laughing
but
he
would
not
look
at
her
he
felt
that
he
had
allowed
his
parental
advantage
to
escape
him
and
he
did
not
know
how
to
reassert
it
farley
made
uneasy
by
the
murmur
of
monotonously
subdued
voices
was
afraid
to
stay
away
any
longer
she
came
in
very
intent
on
the
plate
of
biscuits
she
carried
pretending
that
she
considered
nothing
unusual
afoot
the
atmosphere
of
this
moral
cellar
has
ruined
mine
and
laurie
life
alice
said
angrily
as
if
driven
to
the
words
by
the
sight
of
her
mother
face
farley
was
bewildered
and
angry
farley
slipped
the
plate
of
biscuits
to
the
table
and
sank
weakly
in
a
chair
farley
rose
i
wo
have
you
talk
this
way
before
your
mother
alice
in
the
depths
of
him
he
was
profoundly
alarmed
but
on
the
surface
he
was
sure
of
himself
again
alice
hated
herself
but
she
stood
at
bay
i
respect
your
mother
he
said
and
you
should
do
far
more
than
respect
her
i
want
to
respect
her
but
she
does
respect
herself
farley
wept
helplessly
in
silence
i
wo
have
you
insult
her
alice
i
not
insulting
her
i
not
the
one
who
takes
it
for
granted
that
she
is
willing
to
go
on
forever
and
ever
in
this
equivocal
fashion
done
her
the
honor
of
thinking
she
might
be
glad
to
separate
from
you
and
leave
you
free
to
live
decently
i
go
away
alice
i
go
away
my
children
do
love
me
farley
squinted
her
lids
together
and
throwing
back
her
head
wrung
her
hands
abandonedly
mother
farley
laid
a
soothing
hand
on
her
hair
dry
and
silky
like
fur
she
moved
away
from
him
shaking
her
hands
her
lids
relaxed
smoothly
over
her
eyes
and
the
tears
coursed
more
easily
through
her
worn
lashes
and
fell
upon
the
nose
glasses
dangling
from
the
gold
hook
on
her
breast
you
probably
be
glad
i
gone
oh
my
god
this
is
the
reward
of
my
life
hush
mother
hush
you
talking
nonsense
nobody
even
dreams
of
you
going
away
why
it
preposterous
alice
says
you
want
me
to
go
she
moaned
alice
does
know
what
she
is
talking
about
i
need
you
as
much
as
you
need
me
but
alice
wants
me
to
go
my
children
do
want
me
she
opened
eyes
that
were
blank
with
the
abnormality
of
her
passion
you
do
want
me
mother
she
struggled
to
her
feet
and
brushed
past
him
he
began
to
follow
her
but
halted
half
way
to
the
door
with
an
air
of
helpless
indecision
i
sorry
papa
alice
said
after
a
minute
he
could
not
answer
he
put
his
hand
to
his
head
and
walked
away
from
her
for
a
moment
he
stood
by
the
window
with
his
hands
over
his
eyes
at
last
he
said
it
is
cruel
and
useless
to
subject
your
mother
to
a
thing
like
this
not
to
mention
that
i
do
deserve
it
alice
i
know
it
papa
but
i
hate
to
have
to
keep
looking
at
the
thing
you
and
mamma
are
of
no
earthly
use
to
each
other
and
it
seems
so
stupid
for
you
to
sacrifice
yourself
to
a
lie
like
this
farley
hung
his
head
and
smoothed
his
broad
brow
with
slow
trembling
fingers
readjustments
are
expensive
alice
i
know
they
are
but
you
ca
blame
me
for
wanting
to
see
things
right
they
were
silent
farley
was
uncomfortable
he
did
not
know
what
was
expected
of
him
you
must
try
to
comfort
your
mother
he
said
at
last
she
probably
find
some
comfort
for
herself
alice
said
bitterly
well
i
must
go
to
the
office
my
first
duty
to
her
is
there
trying
not
to
hurry
farley
his
face
averted
walked
out
his
back
as
he
disappeared
through
the
doorway
looked
stiff
and
weary
he
seemed
weak
and
humiliated
like
a
big
dog
in
pain
at
the
noon
hour
farley
came
downstairs
and
shambled
about
the
house
forcing
herself
on
alice
sight
but
refusing
to
speak
as
farley
fingers
fell
into
their
wonted
tasks
the
scene
of
the
morning
became
less
real
to
her
than
the
feel
of
cloth
and
the
posture
of
furniture
the
habit
of
contentment
crept
back
upon
her
she
wanted
nothing
of
others
what
should
they
want
of
her
dryly
she
preserved
her
already
antagonism
on
the
glass
windows
that
stretched
twinkling
with
light
across
the
broad
front
of
the
bakery
and
lunch
room
the
name
was
inscribed
in
a
half
moon
of
raised
white
letters
behind
the
glass
were
mounds
of
iced
cakes
and
piles
of
glossy
yellow
rolls
resting
in
wooden
trays
a
german
with
flat
cheek
bones
a
stiff
mustache
and
narrow
eyes
stood
in
his
undershirt
and
trousers
draped
with
a
soiled
apron
and
laid
out
a
new
supply
of
cakes
with
alternate
chocolate
and
white
so
that
they
formed
a
geometric
pattern
behind
him
on
a
rear
wall
a
large
clock
marked
six
the
hands
on
the
stark
white
dial
rigid
as
the
limbs
of
the
crucified
above
him
lights
glowed
through
globes
of
clouded
glass
groups
of
wagon
drivers
and
workmen
in
gray
jumpers
sat
at
the
tables
and
leaning
forward
with
chests
to
the
marble
tops
slopped
coffee
from
their
saucers
and
shoveled
huge
accretions
of
potatoes
and
meat
into
their
mouths
in
the
attitudes
of
hunting
animals
outside
in
the
dusk
light
spread
hazily
about
the
lamps
in
the
street
over
the
roofs
stars
quivered
delicately
like
fiery
flowers
of
pale
green
on
a
shaken
spray
old
women
crept
along
in
the
vague
brightness
their
backs
bent
parcels
of
bread
and
bits
of
bloody
meat
held
preciously
to
their
shrunken
breasts
or
clutched
in
the
knots
of
their
shawls
a
policeman
leaning
against
a
post
twirled
his
club
and
stared
smugly
into
the
bright
vacant
faces
of
two
girls
in
large
black
velvet
hats
farley
very
genteel
in
her
shabbiness
shrank
from
the
burly
men
and
the
rough
children
who
ran
almost
under
her
feet
but
she
felt
superior
to
them
and
the
sight
of
them
steadied
her
against
life
for
years
she
had
bought
bread
at
the
bakery
as
she
went
in
the
smell
of
baked
bread
floated
against
her
face
like
a
palpable
assurance
of
unchanging
things
but
the
memory
of
the
morning
scene
crept
over
her
like
a
coldness
which
she
seemed
to
feel
in
the
roots
of
her
hair
it
was
pain
to
feel
the
warmth
of
life
flowing
away
her
coldness
shuddered
miserably
against
the
heat
of
the
room
some
rolls
please
fifteen
cents
worth
farley
smile
was
like
the
smile
of
the
drowned
pale
through
water
her
voice
was
so
modulated
that
the
friendly
blonde
woman
with
her
childlike
eyes
had
to
lean
from
behind
the
counter
and
ask
again
what
was
wanted
farley
waited
for
the
rolls
to
be
wrapped
the
steam
from
the
shining
coffee
urns
enveloped
her
every
day
for
a
dozen
years
the
world
motionless
in
an
atmosphere
which
held
the
gestures
of
the
german
baker
and
the
big
blonde
woman
with
the
smiling
face
farley
walked
home
slowly
the
bag
of
bread
dangled
in
her
cramped
hand
as
she
faced
the
chill
wind
blowing
against
her
from
the
direction
of
her
home
chill
wind
of
strangeness
farley
and
alice
were
in
the
house
alice
minded
the
children
farley
awaited
his
dinner
to
farley
they
were
wild
fish
out
of
the
sea
caught
in
her
glass
they
were
in
the
house
making
confident
motions
there
as
fish
swim
at
their
ease
in
an
aquarium
they
were
terrible
as
the
sea
in
a
farley
mounted
the
front
steps
alice
and
farley
were
a
pain
she
would
not
admit
she
shut
them
out
it
should
be
night
and
she
would
remain
in
the
night
where
they
meant
nothing
as
she
walked
through
the
hall
to
the
kitchen
she
felt
strong
again
with
the
monotony
of
life
beds
chairs
tables
walls
rose
strong
about
her
she
made
herself
still
like
the
walls
farley
pushed
the
bedroom
door
back
she
did
not
speak
alice
could
barely
distinguish
the
form
which
agitated
the
darkness
with
its
quiet
the
two
women
felt
for
each
other
through
the
gloom
they
were
like
water
insects
fumbling
with
antennæ
mamma
is
that
you
alice
sat
up
straight
in
bed
farley
her
heart
beating
unevenly
felt
the
harsh
stiffening
of
alice
outline
against
the
white
blot
of
the
sheet
farley
tried
to
speak
she
felt
as
though
the
darkness
were
binding
her
lips
with
gray
transparent
folds
of
shadow
tough
as
silk
yes
what
the
matter
alice
threw
the
sheet
back
and
stood
up
on
the
floor
half
seen
she
upreared
enormously
like
a
wraith
your
father
is
home
yet
farley
said
well
what
of
it
i
know
where
he
is
farley
voice
sounded
cracked
then
you
ought
not
to
worry
he
with
that
woman
farley
words
clacked
like
castanets
in
trembling
hands
then
fell
soundless
alice
pitied
her
mother
and
grew
hard
well
you
knew
he
was
going
to
see
her
there
was
a
silence
then
farley
said
i
know
i
ca
expect
any
sympathy
from
you
my
own
child
connives
with
her
father
to
get
rid
of
me
i
sorry
things
are
like
this
mamma
but
i
wo
be
blamed
for
them
if
i
were
you
i
would
allow
myself
to
be
placed
in
this
kind
of
a
position
oh
i
know
you
i
know
you
farley
voice
broke
as
with
age
and
vindictiveness
she
turned
and
went
out
stumbling
over
the
edge
of
the
matting
and
catching
the
door
lintel
as
she
passed
into
the
light
alice
stood
quietly
a
moment
resisting
the
contagion
of
her
panic
then
conquering
stubbornness
she
followed
farley
was
in
the
back
of
the
hall
leaning
against
the
stair
rail
she
was
in
her
nightdress
that
fell
like
hanging
water
white
through
the
gloom
she
was
making
a
slow
way
toward
the
kitchen
what
are
you
trying
to
do
mamma
alice
called
her
body
uncorseted
was
heavy
she
walked
quickly
after
her
mother
she
knew
what
her
mother
was
trying
to
do
farley
dallied
a
little
but
she
would
not
answer
her
hands
were
hid
carrying
something
alice
came
up
behind
she
caught
her
mother
quickly
from
the
back
give
me
that
pistol
do
you
hear
me
no
no
i
wo
the
scrawny
body
bent
forward
and
doubled
itself
against
alice
reaching
hand
give
it
here
alice
was
quiet
and
sure
with
excitement
her
big
breast
heaved
under
her
loose
nightgown
her
hair
was
tumbled
about
and
her
coarse
face
was
red
with
effort
let
me
then
you
and
your
father
can
do
what
you
please
rubbish
let
it
go
i
say
alice
fingers
were
on
the
gun
its
hardness
and
coldness
reassured
her
of
she
knew
not
what
she
wanted
to
hurt
me
alice
thought
what
other
reason
did
she
have
for
coming
to
me
about
it
oh
oh
you
hurt
my
wrist
alice
clutched
her
mother
fingers
and
was
cruel
to
them
the
strong
fingers
pressed
and
twisted
still
stronger
give
me
that
gun
it
dropped
with
a
dull
clatter
on
the
bare
floor
farley
power
over
others
was
her
power
to
hurt
herself
now
it
was
gone
she
was
feeble
you
try
to
get
your
father
to
leave
me
you
want
to
see
me
left
here
without
anything
and
you
wo
let
me
kill
myself
she
hiccoughed
beginning
to
cry
the
gaslight
on
the
wall
was
turned
low
alice
reached
for
the
screw
and
sent
the
flame
up
so
that
a
yellow
flood
swept
the
shadows
away
farley
eyes
squinted
at
the
light
she
huddled
against
the
wall
her
gray
hair
undone
clung
to
her
bare
neck
above
her
open
nightdress
her
eyes
lifted
to
alice
were
opaque
with
misery
below
her
nightdress
her
feet
were
bare
her
toes
with
bulbous
joints
rested
flaccid
on
the
scrap
of
brown
carpet
at
the
head
of
the
stair
she
turned
away
from
alice
and
began
to
fumble
blindly
for
the
rail
where
are
you
going
farley
slid
herself
feebly
along
the
rail
and
down
the
first
step
i
do
know
i
do
know
she
wailed
stop
acting
like
that
mamma
you
know
you
can
stand
up
i
ca
i
ca
i
do
care
what
becomes
of
me
alice
caught
her
mother
in
a
grasp
of
repugnance
and
pulled
her
back
you
got
to
brace
up
you
do
care
what
i
think
of
you
or
what
you
do
to
me
but
you
have
to
have
a
little
pride
and
a
sense
of
responsibility
toward
bobby
and
may
you
ca
let
them
see
a
thing
like
this
is
laurence
home
yet
no
he
not
home
why
should
i
feel
responsible
for
bobby
and
may
you
think
i
not
fit
for
them
you
want
to
take
them
away
from
me
i
not
going
to
pamper
you
by
arguing
with
you
if
i
seriously
thought
that
you
wanted
to
end
your
life
i
should
consider
that
interference
was
none
of
my
business
but
and
yet
you
expect
me
to
live
none
of
your
business
oh
my
god
but
as
you
have
no
real
intention
of
killing
yourself
you
have
no
right
to
subject
me
to
a
scene
like
this
i
want
a
little
peace
a
little
peace
oh
my
god
a
little
peace
farley
shut
her
eyes
and
let
her
head
fall
backward
and
forward
limply
as
though
there
were
no
vertebræ
in
her
neck
alice
shook
her
stop
it
mamma
farley
rocked
herself
like
a
drunken
woman
finally
her
eyes
yet
closed
she
shuddered
and
was
still
are
you
calm
now
yes
i
calm
whatever
i
do
makes
no
difference
to
you
nothing
i
do
affects
you
you
hard
as
nails
we
wo
talk
about
that
you
can
affect
me
but
because
that
is
just
what
you
want
to
do
i
not
going
to
let
you
i
want
to
do
she
says
i
want
to
do
i
have
to
talk
you
into
a
state
of
common
sense
still
farley
head
nodded
as
if
with
sleep
and
her
eyes
remained
shut
common
sense
yes
common
sense
she
repeated
like
a
dream
echoing
me
in
that
stupid
way
wo
keep
me
from
going
on
stupid
she
calls
it
a
stupid
way
my
god
my
god
what
agony
farley
almost
shrieked
out
agony
her
knotted
hands
clutched
her
flat
breasts
as
if
with
hunger
her
voice
was
dully
intense
her
wrinkled
lids
twitched
why
does
she
twitch
her
face
alice
lips
curled
almost
like
a
snarl
you
find
me
giving
away
and
raving
too
if
you
do
watch
out
mamma
i
ca
stand
too
much
of
this
farley
opened
her
eyes
slowly
but
she
kept
her
gaze
vague
against
the
solid
antagonism
of
alice
eyes
i
going
back
to
my
room
now
i
ca
sleep
but
i
wo
burden
you
any
longer
with
the
sight
of
me
you
can
tell
your
father
i
not
going
to
trouble
him
any
more
he
can
start
his
proceedings
for
divorce
i
do
know
what
the
prices
will
say
what
they
will
think
they
probably
imagined
just
as
i
did
that
the
whole
thing
was
over
twelve
years
ago
when
i
went
through
so
much
humiliation
to
save
your
father
it
took
the
diabolical
vileness
of
my
own
daughter
to
draw
her
father
and
this
woman
together
again
after
we
had
a
happy
home
and
were
all
at
peace
i
did
have
a
happy
home
papa
has
a
happy
home
i
know
i
vile
guilty
of
all
manner
of
vileness
it
was
vile
of
me
to
slave
and
work
as
i
done
and
take
all
of
the
responsibility
off
laurence
hands
and
slave
for
winnie
and
the
children
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
winnie
and
the
children
i
do
know
what
charge
your
father
can
bring
then
as
soon
as
he
gets
it
he
can
rush
off
and
marry
that
thing
to
judge
by
the
way
she
was
going
when
i
saw
her
she
must
be
and
fat
by
now
but
your
father
wo
mind
so
long
as
she
not
me
then
my
daughter
will
be
freed
of
me
winnie
and
laurence
can
get
somebody
else
to
fetch
and
carry
and
clean
up
for
their
children
as
you
say
i
have
no
right
here
i
ought
not
to
be
alive
but
you
can
tell
your
father
how
it
is
and
he
find
a
way
to
get
rid
of
me
alice
was
still
like
a
mountain
that
all
right
mamma
i
tell
papa
what
you
say
that
you
are
willing
for
him
to
arrange
for
a
divorce
is
that
all
right
that
it
that
it
let
him
arrange
it
anyway
he
will
and
do
have
too
much
consideration
for
my
feelings
let
him
tell
the
judge
that
worn
out
my
good
looks
so
i
do
attract
him
any
longer
alice
had
heard
the
door
slam
below
stairs
she
stared
at
her
unconscious
face
and
said
nothing
farley
dragging
her
feet
exaggeratedly
moved
off
into
her
bedroom
then
alice
pattered
quickly
down
the
stairs
and
met
her
father
in
the
hall
he
had
heard
voices
and
looked
alarmed
is
anything
the
matter
he
asked
seeing
her
face
angry
and
elated
and
that
she
wore
only
her
nightgown
yes
come
into
the
alice
said
they
walked
in
farley
was
a
long
time
finding
the
light
he
felt
choked
by
the
guilty
beating
of
his
heart
when
he
had
made
the
room
bright
he
turned
to
alice
almost
in
fear
she
looked
so
ugly
flushed
with
her
hair
in
confusion
and
her
angry
eyes
i
been
talking
to
mamma
alice
said
breathlessly
farley
face
was
drawn
he
blinked
at
the
light
gaining
time
i
asked
you
not
to
talk
to
your
mother
he
said
uncomfortably
i
know
you
did
but
she
talked
to
me
and
i
could
keep
my
mouth
shut
she
began
by
saying
she
knew
where
you
had
gone
she
says
she
willing
to
agree
to
a
divorce
farley
did
not
know
what
to
say
the
situation
had
been
forced
upon
him
unaware
and
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
this
is
nonsense
alice
your
mother
knows
that
he
held
his
brow
with
his
hand
why
is
it
nonsense
you
given
up
most
of
your
life
to
her
but
i
do
see
why
you
should
keep
on
doing
it
farley
could
not
understand
what
was
happening
nor
how
it
was
he
felt
borne
forward
on
an
invisible
current
that
flowed
from
alice
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
you
must
start
these
things
alice
alice
watched
him
contemptuously
do
blame
me
for
the
nightmare
of
lies
and
hypocrisy
that
exists
between
you
and
mamma
farley
kept
rubbing
his
head
then
he
walked
stealthily
to
the
hall
door
and
closed
it
his
eyes
as
he
lifted
them
to
alice
face
had
the
blind
awareness
of
a
sheep
he
seemed
to
know
all
and
to
perceive
nothing
you
must
misunderstand
me
alice
it
is
true
that
a
satisfying
companionship
can
not
exist
between
me
and
your
mother
but
she
and
i
have
made
compromises
for
each
other
that
have
made
it
possible
for
us
to
live
and
i
ca
think
lightly
of
hurting
her
they
were
silent
farley
shaded
his
eyes
with
an
unsteady
hand
you
did
go
to
see
wilson
tonight
did
you
alice
asked
after
a
minute
yes
she
is
passing
through
town
i
had
seen
her
for
three
years
my
god
you
do
need
to
apologize
for
it
they
were
quiet
again
so
you
do
want
to
accept
anything
from
mamma
even
if
she
is
willing
to
give
you
do
understand
alice
that
very
fact
makes
me
even
more
responsible
for
my
own
resolutions
his
voice
shook
look
here
papa
i
always
imagined
you
had
sacrificed
yourself
outright
to
mamma
weakness
and
dependency
and
now
when
you
have
a
chance
to
get
away
from
her
and
live
with
somebody
who
is
younger
whom
you
seem
to
care
for
you
actually
seem
to
be
dodging
the
issue
just
as
though
you
were
contented
with
your
situation
you
must
remember
that
wilson
must
be
considered
that
what
i
selfishly
want
he
stopped
patiently
through
all
these
years
he
had
strained
forward
like
an
animal
pulling
a
loaded
cart
and
now
the
cart
was
being
taken
from
him
he
was
disconcerted
to
find
himself
still
straining
forward
pulling
at
nothingness
bewildered
he
tried
to
save
his
ideal
of
himself
you
must
remember
we
have
never
really
considered
a
divorce
possible
well
papa
of
course
i
ca
decide
your
life
for
you
if
you
feel
that
you
owe
it
to
your
son
she
turned
resolutely
he
felt
her
scorn
he
hated
her
but
he
could
not
bear
to
have
her
go
he
covered
his
face
she
walked
out
he
could
hear
her
run
up
the
stairs
her
bare
feet
making
a
soft
sound
he
wanted
to
call
her
back
but
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
it
was
necessary
to
him
to
think
well
of
himself
farley
went
about
her
housework
with
renewed
determination
she
would
speak
to
no
one
but
laurence
at
the
table
she
served
them
all
but
if
there
was
any
general
talk
she
did
not
hear
it
farley
grew
into
the
habit
of
giving
her
furtive
looks
he
forgot
to
eat
he
talked
mostly
to
bobby
and
may
the
weather
was
quite
mild
but
farley
took
to
wearing
an
old
red
cashmere
shawl
and
pulling
it
tight
about
her
throat
when
her
husband
or
her
daughter
sought
her
averted
gaze
she
wrapped
herself
tighter
and
shivered
ostentatiously
bobby
was
too
young
to
note
changes
which
did
not
directly
affect
his
interest
but
may
with
her
shining
eyes
of
a
little
stuffed
goat
ruminated
in
her
own
way
on
what
was
making
her
grandmother
eccentric
the
little
girl
pale
lips
parted
loosely
in
wonder
as
ignoring
her
food
she
watched
her
grandmother
oblivious
face
bent
over
the
coffee
farley
was
conscious
of
this
gaze
which
had
in
it
neither
approval
nor
condemnation
she
felt
at
a
disadvantage
before
the
child
and
when
may
asked
for
anything
found
it
difficult
not
to
push
her
away
with
expressions
of
violence
laurence
saw
that
something
was
wrong
again
between
his
parents
alice
with
her
damned
interference
he
told
himself
when
his
mother
spoke
to
him
his
voice
was
gentle
but
he
could
not
endure
other
people
pain
he
kept
away
from
her
as
much
as
possible
in
this
web
of
silence
between
her
father
and
mother
alice
felt
herself
caught
by
threads
of
iron
she
could
not
move
one
morning
when
she
and
her
mother
were
alone
alice
said
i
told
papa
that
you
were
willing
for
him
to
arrange
a
divorce
farley
face
in
its
deliberated
vagueness
quivered
like
a
gray
jelly
but
she
kept
her
eyes
away
and
her
body
did
not
quicken
to
more
expressive
life
yes
i
supposed
you
did
i
suppose
by
now
the
two
of
you
have
fixed
it
up
you
have
to
talk
sensibly
about
it
or
he
ca
do
it
farley
gave
alice
one
weak
terrible
look
alice
could
not
bear
the
look
to
get
away
from
it
and
from
a
desire
to
do
something
violent
she
walked
into
the
the
children
were
playing
in
the
back
yard
when
bobby
fell
down
and
hurt
himself
may
sat
flat
on
the
grass
before
the
sandpile
but
when
she
saw
that
bobby
was
hurt
she
struggled
to
her
feet
on
her
thin
legs
like
a
weak
young
colt
and
went
to
help
him
you
full
of
dirt
she
squatted
before
him
brushing
his
clothes
her
stiff
petticoats
tilted
up
in
front
her
buttocks
in
small
soiled
drawers
swinging
close
to
the
earth
just
then
aunt
alice
came
out
of
the
kitchen
door
and
stood
on
the
step
in
the
sunshine
her
bare
hair
showed
a
burnt
brown
the
wind
whipped
her
heavy
skirts
against
her
stout
thighs
she
saw
bobby
crying
with
his
mouth
open
and
his
eyes
shut
trying
to
squeeze
the
tears
from
between
his
lids
hush
that
bobby
are
you
ashamed
of
yourself
bobby
cried
louder
when
she
came
down
the
path
her
undeviating
approach
made
him
mad
with
passion
dow
he
shouted
when
aunt
alice
reached
him
he
pounded
against
her
stomach
with
his
fists
she
clasped
his
plump
wrists
folded
in
fat
and
held
them
while
he
struggled
until
the
dirt
and
sweat
with
which
they
were
grimed
rolled
up
under
her
fingers
at
this
moment
she
loved
him
more
intensely
because
she
could
hurt
him
dow
he
kept
shouting
his
hair
was
tumbled
about
his
face
he
was
red
with
passion
when
he
had
freed
himself
he
ran
toward
the
house
i
hate
aunt
alice
i
hate
aunt
alice
i
wants
my
dranma
he
called
back
with
sudden
confidence
may
sidled
toward
her
aunt
we
been
mud
pies
and
coverin
with
sand
like
icin
she
said
alice
looked
down
pale
may
hair
shining
like
a
dead
sun
alice
all
at
once
hated
may
hair
because
it
was
pale
and
bright
it
too
chilly
to
make
mud
pies
for
heaven
sake
do
put
your
dirty
hands
on
me
may
with
a
violent
push
alice
put
the
little
girl
aside
and
walked
briskly
up
the
path
a
few
surprised
tears
trickled
from
the
resigned
and
shining
misery
of
may
eyes
she
watched
her
aunt
move
toward
the
house
conscious
of
may
pale
hair
floating
after
her
in
unsubstantial
brightness
alice
rushed
up
the
stairs
to
her
room
she
pulled
down
the
shades
longing
for
the
heaviness
of
dark
the
room
in
shadow
was
a
pool
on
which
alice
unhappiness
dreamy
and
intermittent
floated
like
a
swamp
light
outside
the
softness
of
the
room
where
solitude
allowed
her
to
relax
the
soul
of
her
family
surrounded
her
rearing
its
ramparts
of
towers
beaten
in
the
iron
of
years
where
will
my
light
go
to
ugly
old
maid
emancipation
of
women
why
did
i
not
tell
him
that
i
loved
him
darkness
floated
from
her
words
the
morning
was
gray
the
windows
along
the
street
were
fathomlessly
blank
across
the
asphalt
wet
wheel
tracks
stretched
glistening
and
sinuous
like
black
rubber
snakes
farley
stepped
into
the
street
and
closed
the
front
door
stealthily
behind
him
too
agitated
to
endure
breakfast
with
his
family
he
remembered
the
cheap
restaurant
around
the
corner
a
place
lined
with
grotesque
mirrors
and
white
and
narrow
like
the
corridor
of
a
ship
when
he
went
in
he
found
the
floor
covered
with
linoleum
smeared
and
darkened
with
grease
and
the
cloth
on
the
table
where
he
seated
himself
was
stained
with
splashes
of
wine
the
waiter
came
up
a
soft
heavy
man
whose
feet
pressed
the
floor
as
soundlessly
as
those
of
a
panther
farley
took
the
list
of
dishes
from
the
waiter
hand
fat
like
the
hand
of
a
corpse
the
waiter
sad
little
eyes
were
set
in
a
broad
white
face
stubbled
with
bluish
beard
when
he
moved
away
he
was
like
a
ghost
his
large
hips
swayed
his
soiled
apron
floated
over
a
generous
belly
as
profound
as
sleep
flies
buzzed
against
the
walls
and
fell
back
upon
the
table
coverings
and
the
cracked
cruets
opaque
from
many
fillings
farley
stirred
gray
crystals
of
sugar
into
the
blackness
of
his
coffee
then
clouded
it
with
the
pale
milk
that
brimmed
the
squat
white
pitcher
he
tried
to
think
things
out
but
he
had
nurtured
his
on
the
verity
of
abnegation
and
it
was
hard
for
him
to
accept
as
a
blessing
the
thing
which
it
had
given
him
so
much
comfort
to
do
without
safe
in
the
conviction
that
there
would
be
no
end
to
his
sacrifice
he
had
allowed
full
abandon
to
his
mystical
and
repressed
nature
helen
wilson
had
become
glorified
and
beyond
attainment
he
was
in
terror
of
seeing
her
too
clearly
when
her
neat
figure
a
little
stout
emerged
distinctly
from
the
chaos
of
his
reflections
he
deliberately
let
down
a
curtain
of
confusion
across
the
mirror
of
his
consciousness
after
dinner
farley
went
into
the
and
seated
himself
in
an
armchair
he
had
scarcely
exchanged
a
word
with
any
one
during
the
meal
he
bent
his
head
in
his
hands
the
light
from
the
shaded
lamp
glistened
obliquely
along
the
thin
parting
of
his
hair
and
his
baldish
scalp
farley
made
pretexts
to
come
near
him
in
the
afternoon
she
had
been
mending
a
nightdress
of
may
and
left
it
on
top
of
the
magazine
rack
and
now
she
came
to
get
it
she
was
a
long
time
putting
her
sewing
things
together
farley
saw
her
but
he
did
not
stir
alice
had
followed
her
mother
into
the
room
and
halted
abruptly
behind
her
farley
did
not
see
alice
farley
started
a
little
glanced
at
his
daughter
and
looked
away
again
alice
watching
the
two
people
felt
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
weighted
with
inertias
these
people
forced
her
back
into
herself
into
her
own
dumbness
she
wanted
to
shatter
her
silence
with
their
cries
turn
around
here
and
look
at
papa
mamma
alice
said
suddenly
farley
would
not
look
your
father
knows
what
i
think
she
said
after
a
minute
she
glanced
at
alice
farley
wore
her
and
the
irridescence
of
glass
added
remoteness
to
her
hostile
uneasy
eyes
the
gold
clasp
drawing
the
flesh
together
on
her
nose
gave
a
twist
of
severity
to
her
dry
obscure
face
her
hate
seemed
to
flow
uncertainly
through
the
crystals
and
flash
defiance
in
the
gold
center
the
little
gold
clasp
of
the
was
like
the
claw
of
impotence
buried
in
its
own
flesh
alice
tapped
the
floor
with
her
foot
do
you
know
what
mamma
thinks
papa
i
sure
i
do
farley
stared
under
his
fingers
at
the
floor
where
the
dim
pattern
of
the
carpet
grew
more
dim
i
know
what
you
have
told
me
i
ca
stand
the
atmosphere
here
if
you
and
she
do
find
some
way
to
talk
it
out
you
drive
laurence
and
me
insane
farley
sighed
deeply
i
ready
and
willing
to
discuss
anything
i
have
felt
lately
that
i
have
become
an
intruder
in
your
mother
eyes
but
i
hardly
know
what
has
happened
alice
farley
glanced
at
the
bright
baldish
spot
in
her
husband
scalp
it
seemed
to
her
the
center
of
the
unreality
in
which
she
had
existed
of
late
and
she
was
as
if
held
together
by
the
grip
of
the
glasses
on
her
nose
the
one
tense
and
sure
sensation
which
contradicted
her
feeling
of
dispersion
then
she
looked
at
alice
i
ca
leave
may
and
bobby
upstairs
alone
even
to
talk
things
over
she
pulled
the
red
shawl
about
her
neck
and
started
for
the
door
it
seems
to
me
you
and
your
father
have
settled
my
life
for
me
anyway
she
called
back
farley
did
not
move
for
a
moment
after
her
exit
then
he
stood
up
and
making
a
hopeless
gesture
with
his
hands
walked
out
in
silence
shaking
his
head
his
thoughts
were
eddying
in
a
current
which
sucked
down
his
he
wanted
to
give
back
her
happiness
to
his
wife
that
it
might
make
him
beautiful
in
his
own
eyes
he
wanted
the
cool
peace
of
purchased
misery
alice
left
alone
was
hot
and
futile
i
shall
go
out
of
me
in
dark
blood
she
walked
to
the
window
the
street
was
empty
over
the
housetops
the
quiet
sky
and
the
cold
moon
she
leaned
her
forehead
against
the
glass
and
looked
into
the
street
she
felt
suddenly
tired
endless
capable
of
giving
birth
to
endless
selves
she
was
tired
she
could
not
die
she
was
like
a
mother
bearing
herself
forever
like
endless
children
part
iii
there
was
a
blacksmith
forge
down
the
road
by
the
farmhouse
where
winnie
and
her
mother
were
staying
in
the
morning
in
the
silence
the
first
sound
winnie
heard
was
the
chiming
of
the
hammer
like
a
bell
there
were
maple
trees
against
her
window
the
leaves
were
yellowing
when
the
sun
shone
through
them
they
were
a
silken
veil
of
light
the
days
were
long
and
bright
the
farmer
wife
was
busy
with
household
tasks
and
winnie
and
her
mother
spent
uninterrupted
hours
on
the
long
narrow
veranda
when
price
embroidered
or
read
a
novel
while
winnie
listened
winnie
was
oppressed
by
the
silence
she
had
not
cared
at
first
to
believe
that
she
would
have
a
child
but
the
dark
thought
ran
along
after
her
like
a
dog
that
will
not
be
beaten
off
she
knew
it
was
there
in
her
mind
but
she
would
not
recognize
it
beach
came
into
the
country
to
visit
her
he
spoke
of
the
care
she
must
give
to
her
health
and
he
told
her
that
if
she
continued
to
improve
over
a
long
time
she
might
be
able
to
evade
the
operation
it
was
only
when
he
gave
her
hope
that
despair
forced
her
to
realize
herself
she
gazed
at
him
in
helpless
terror
when
he
turned
to
speak
to
her
mother
winnie
left
the
room
and
while
he
remained
she
did
not
come
back
after
the
doctor
had
gone
price
entered
the
farm
bedroom
and
found
winnie
lying
on
her
face
winnie
my
darling
you
are
sobbing
your
heart
out
body
trembled
and
her
precise
voice
shook
she
laid
her
hand
on
winnie
wrist
but
winnie
could
not
tell
she
glanced
up
her
little
face
dim
with
despair
winnie
are
you
in
pain
shall
i
call
the
doctor
again
winnie
my
darling
dear
child
answer
me
you
must
not
act
like
this
but
winnie
buried
her
head
in
pillows
and
would
not
reply
she
had
wept
out
all
she
wanted
to
say
she
was
sodden
she
was
still
there
was
nothing
left
in
her
but
silence
price
tears
of
anxiety
in
her
eyes
gripped
winnie
wrists
and
held
them
tight
they
were
still
together
the
wooden
clock
ticked
on
the
low
mantel
then
price
said
winnie
if
you
can
not
manage
to
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
i
shall
telegraph
your
father
crushed
against
price
finality
winnie
struggled
to
free
herself
i
want
to
die
oh
i
want
to
die
she
said
and
every
time
she
said
die
something
in
her
shouted
against
the
dumbness
of
her
throat
life
life
the
shriek
was
against
laurence
and
against
the
living
child
that
had
come
to
consume
her
price
shivered
as
with
cold
but
she
tried
to
be
calm
winnie
speaking
very
low
you
use
some
something
terrible
has
happened
you
have
heard
something
from
home
which
you
have
not
told
me
i
am
your
mother
i
love
you
better
than
anything
in
the
world
and
you
have
no
right
to
keep
me
in
ignorance
of
anything
that
is
troubling
you
her
lips
were
bluish
and
her
upper
lip
was
wet
with
sweat
the
skin
on
her
hands
was
withered
like
white
crêpe
and
the
veins
swelled
in
her
trembling
wrists
the
clock
ticked
winnie
murmured
something
in
the
pillow
price
waited
outside
the
open
window
the
evening
air
congealed
in
heaviness
it
hung
cold
and
bitter
over
the
moist
grass
the
smell
of
weeds
floated
into
the
room
price
looked
out
and
saw
that
each
stalk
of
golden
rod
in
the
meadow
opposite
was
separately
still
the
sky
was
blue
stone
only
the
pine
trees
seemed
warm
against
the
vacuous
shining
of
twilight
for
night
was
terrible
descending
in
brightness
it
was
a
mirror
in
the
pale
still
sky
it
was
nothing
slowly
the
darkness
grew
up
from
the
earth
and
as
the
trees
darkened
the
earth
began
to
grow
into
being
winnie
was
glad
of
the
darkness
when
the
room
grew
dark
she
did
not
hold
the
child
separately
in
her
body
it
lay
with
her
in
the
body
of
the
dark
and
she
was
freed
of
it
mamma
she
sat
up
her
body
a
harsh
gray
stroke
of
determination
against
the
white
inert
pillow
yes
my
dear
price
smoothed
her
child
brow
oh
i
am
so
glad
you
are
quieter
winnie
out
of
the
silence
from
which
the
sun
had
passed
the
moon
suddenly
unrolled
huge
and
white
and
dry
as
a
dead
flower
a
darting
across
the
window
and
the
dry
white
face
of
the
moon
so
gorgeously
lifeless
was
a
gold
thorn
sinking
into
the
quiet
flesh
of
shadow
voices
sounded
from
the
road
the
lowest
branches
of
the
trees
yet
trembled
with
light
then
the
world
died
away
in
the
chirping
of
insects
and
the
bleat
of
frogs
i
will
light
a
lamp
darling
price
went
over
to
a
table
she
could
barely
be
seen
the
match
spurted
suddenly
into
flame
and
she
was
plain
again
when
the
lamp
was
lit
the
night
outside
went
black
and
the
moon
now
vast
and
green
and
strange
rushed
gorgeously
against
the
lifted
window
pane
lamplight
sucked
at
the
shadows
but
could
not
draw
them
utterly
to
itself
so
that
the
corners
of
the
big
room
remained
vague
and
only
here
and
there
some
object
gave
out
a
grudging
glint
price
was
stiff
but
shaken
and
gentle
now
winnie
darling
tell
me
what
has
made
you
like
this
she
came
to
the
bed
and
looked
down
winnie
threw
back
her
head
and
with
closed
eyes
plucked
at
the
bedclothes
i
ca

and
sweeter

babies
winnie
began
to
throw
herself
about
in
the
bed
again
oh

rather
be
dead
than
to
be
sick
and
have
another
baby
i
know
i
going
to
die

another
baby
price
did
not
receive
the
words
they
were
strange
they
remained
outside
her
then
all
at
once
without
her
being
aware
of
the
moment
their
meaning
entered
into
her
and
burnt
her
with
terror
what
do
you
mean
winnie
this
is
possible
price
seated
herself
shakily
on
the
bed
and
took
winnie
struggling
hands
again
ba
this
is
nonsense
winnie
she
held
winnie
hands
firmly
her
own
hands
were
dry
and
hot
price
felt
strange
with
herself
the
words
had
changed
her
she
was
in
a
new
place
how
long
has
this
she
tried
to
speak
her
throat
was
dry
she
could
not
go
on
oh
do
ask
me
six
weeks
two
months
i
do
know
winnie
are
you
sure
of
this
i
sure
of
it
price
grip
on
winnie
arms
relaxed
winnie
lay
still
moaning
price
got
up
her
eyes
looked
wasted
with
fear
she
stared
helplessly
at
her
daughter
oh
winnie
what
shall
i
do
for
you
winnie
nostrils
very
wide
open
quivered
like
those
of
a
mare
crazy
with
a
painful
bit
i
wo
i
die
first
she
said
i
wo
laurence
was
around
her
in
her
formless
like
smoke
her
animosity
to
him
was
living
its
separate
life
within
her
she
sobbed
herself
into
numbness
she
would
not
feel
it
she
wanted
the
life
in
her
to
lie
cold
and
numb
her
breasts
swelled
she
thought
she
could
feel
the
milk
flowing
through
them
like
shame
through
her
flesh
price
walked
up
and
down
the
room
clasping
and
unclasping
her
hands
yes
i
send
for
beach
we
must
send
for
beach
i
can
not
understand
your
husband
winnie
bewildered
by
the
catastrophe
as
she
was
it
gave
her
a
certain
feeling
of
assurance
to
be
able
unreservedly
to
condemn
laurence
again
she
gazed
at
winnie
prone
on
the
bed
and
felt
suddenly
sickened
with
futility
all
of
price
sickened
and
armed
against
laurence
she
wanted
to
snatch
the
child
from
the
taint
of
its
father
as
from
a
disease
why
did
you
tell
me
this
sooner
winnie
something
might
have
been
done
you
know
how
unwise
this
is
in
your
state
winnie
stared
at
her
mother
i
going
to
die
again
tears
swam
in
price
eyes
but
she
would
not
unbend
herself
no
dear
you
are
not
going
to
die
we
will
take
good
care
of
you
and
you
will
come
through
this
terrible
thing
winnie
stirred
wearily
and
impatiently
i
do
care
i
going
to
die
she
was
stubborn
and
calm
now
die
was
a
stupid
word
like
dust
it
settled
dully
upon
her
pain
price
wrote
a
letter
to
farley
winnie
is
evidently
going
to
have
another
baby
this
is
a
great
misfortune
i
can
not
understand
how
laurence
allowed
this
to
occur
in
her
state
you
may
imagine
it
was
apparent
that
price
was
alarmed
and
that
in
writing
the
letter
her
hand
had
trembled
but
it
was
plain
too
that
in
her
veiled
reproaches
she
was
still
delicately
gratifying
her
hatred
of
laurence
winnie
waiting
for
beach
refused
to
stay
in
bed
she
got
up
and
put
on
a
flowered
négligé
and
sat
by
the
open
window
looking
down
the
long
wet
road
she
hated
the
hill
that
set
itself
up
heavily
between
her
and
the
sky
she
hated
life
that
came
to
the
end
of
itself
abruptly
like
the
road
to
the
horizon
at
the
end
of
the
hill
when
beach
came
in
winnie
spoke
to
him
resentfully
and
when
her
mother
told
him
what
was
the
matter
blushed
a
defiant
crimson
it
was
a
delicate
situation
to
consider
all
three
people
thought
of
laurence
with
condemnation
but
mention
of
him
was
eschewed
when
price
talked
her
voice
was
choked
with
pent
opprobrium
beach
told
winnie
to
undo
her
dressing
gown
when
he
examined
her
his
hot
hands
touched
her
cold
body
here
and
there
lightly
she
felt
her
body
harshen
to
his
touch
it
was
at
the
moment
when
his
hand
touched
her
that
the
child
became
hers
it
was
not
that
she
wanted
the
child
but
that
she
wanted
the
thing
the
man
could
not
touch
she
hated
the
day
when
the
child
would
no
longer
be
secret
after
the
doctor
had
touched
her
and
made
her
aware
of
the
child
she
ceased
in
part
to
feel
that
laurence
was
in
the
child
flesh
she
would
have
liked
to
think
of
herself
as
the
only
creature
capable
of
giving
birth
beach
was
uncomfortable
he
talked
vaguely
he
had
advised
her
against
having
a
child
but
because
it
would
have
been
better
to
avoid
this
contingency
there
was
no
reason
to
suppose
she
would
not
pull
through
all
right
above
all
he
told
price
keep
her
mind
off
herself
do
not
allow
her
to
become
depressed
nearly
four
months
had
passed
while
winnie
remained
in
the
country
with
her
mother
autumn
was
at
a
close
one
day
winnie
felt
her
flesh
move
this
quickening
was
as
though
she
had
never
before
known
herself
with
child
she
conjectured
for
the
first
time
all
of
the
inevitable
details
of
the
baby
birth
there
was
nothing
to
speculate
she
felt
herself
caught
in
the
grip
of
this
horrible
sameness
one
sunday
price
came
down
from
town
to
see
them
he
had
the
air
of
a
victor
and
price
who
was
conquering
the
exultance
of
her
resentment
toward
laurence
felt
guilty
in
understanding
her
secret
content
that
man
ought
to
be
killed
price
said
to
his
wife
he
ought
to
be
strung
up
and
tarred
and
feathered
nothing
is
too
severe
to
do
to
a
fellow
like
that
i
suppose
you
say
that
for
winnie
sake
we
must
keep
our
hands
off
price
was
agitated
oh
yes
we
must
try
to
keep
the
peace
for
winnie
sake
you
must
remember
perry
this
is
a
hard
time
for
her
price
walked
back
and
forth
across
the
room
flapping
his
with
his
hands
and
blowing
out
his
mustache
i
should
say
it
was
i
should
say
it
was
he
repeated
he
had
his
head
lowered
like
that
of
a
bull
about
to
charge
and
in
the
depths
of
his
murky
blue
eyes
glowed
a
surreptitious
spark
of
triumph
bad
blood
in
that
farley
family
he
said
winnie
came
into
the
room
reluctantly
prepared
to
resist
her
bullying
her
soft
eyes
were
hard
with
reserves
price
came
up
to
her
and
gave
her
a
dominating
caress
well
winifred
how
are
you
my
dear
little
girl
she
returned
his
perfunctory
kiss
her
moist
lips
cool
with
distaste
feeling
pretty
badly
dear
no
father
i
feeling
pretty
well
he
cleared
his
throat
he
was
disappointed
i
ought
to
be
going
home
winnie
pouted
smiling
a
little
but
mother
wo
let
me
i
had
letters
from
laurie
and
mamma
farley
just
today
and
they
are
worried
about
me
worried
about
you
so
are
we
worried
about
you
i
like
to
know
where
home
is
if
it
not
right
here
with
your
mother
your
own
mother
is
certainly
the
one
to
take
care
of
you
when
you
in
this
state
mamma
farley
took
care
of
me
when
my
other
two
babies
were
born
winnie
said
stiffly
price
choked
and
to
relieve
himself
went
to
the
window
and
spit
price
began
to
speak
tremulously
for
his
comfort
those
were
circumstances
we
could
help
dear
thank
heaven
that
this
time
when
you
are
really
more
seriously
in
need
of
us
we
are
here
beside
you
to
do
everything
in
our
power
i
think
winnie
ought
to
lie
down
and
rest
price
said
shepherding
her
husband
out
of
the
room
before
his
exultance
should
become
too
crass
laurence
came
heavily
into
the
house
and
hung
up
his
hat
all
day
he
had
felt
the
new
child
a
fiery
thread
through
the
blackness
of
his
mind
sewing
him
to
earth
his
fear
of
the
new
child
smoldered
like
a
hot
ache
in
the
back
of
his
brain
years
old
he
could
not
bear
to
recall
in
detail
the
incidents
of
his
life
he
had
achieved
nothing
so
he
had
ceased
to
believe
in
achievement
as
a
boy
he
had
invariably
thought
of
himself
in
grandiose
and
rôles
when
girls
had
come
into
his
dreams
they
had
come
in
gratitude
to
receive
some
contemptuous
beneficence
at
his
hands
he
was
ashamed
now
when
he
recalled
the
gauche
sense
of
superiority
that
had
showed
itself
in
bad
manners
and
yet
his
habit
of
mind
remained
the
same
when
he
ceased
to
give
himself
he
would
admit
equality
and
he
could
not
do
that
his
pride
bound
him
to
endless
obligations
against
winnie
he
obliterated
gladness
in
himself
and
denied
his
acquisitive
spirit
she
should
have
him
all
and
he
would
be
nothing
the
door
in
the
hall
opened
behind
laurence
and
closed
with
a
sharp
click
of
the
latch
laurence
moved
in
the
heaviness
of
circles
but
alice
movements
were
always
angular
and
resistant
hello
laurie
she
said
coldly
they
seldom
talked
together
the
gas
flame
burnt
blue
in
the
cold
hall
alice
took
off
her
beaver
sailor
hat
and
hung
it
beside
laurence
derby
she
looked
at
him
the
patience
she
read
in
his
coarse
florid
face
was
like
everything
else
in
the
house
the
house
at
night
was
a
monstrous
phlegmatic
beast
half
drowned
its
inmates
were
sightless
parasites
alice
was
pugnacious
what
the
matter
with
you
she
joked
brusquely
winnie
has
had
twins
has
she
winnie
all
right
laurence
said
how
do
you
regard
the
prospect
of
becoming
a
proud
father
a
third
time
laurence
she
demanded
suddenly
she
knew
she
was
offensive
but
felt
she
must
wrench
something
from
this
huge
mass
of
bitterly
desponding
flesh
the
world
was
muted
with
fleshiness
and
heaviness
only
in
her
own
body
pain
rang
clear
and
sharp
and
chiming
sweet
her
pain
was
her
beauty
that
she
kept
inside
herself
it
was
her
virginity
she
felt
that
he
had
no
beauty
of
pain
you
are
the
only
thing
that
reconciles
me
to
it
alice
he
retorted
sourly
a
benighted
old
spinster
eh
well
i
have
a
pretty
wife
and
shall
soon
have
three
lovely
children
my
state
has
its
compensatory
illusions
ah
yes
i
suppose
it
has
she
did
not
know
what
more
to
say
to
him
he
walked
into
the
ignoring
her
it
was
a
moment
before
she
could
make
herself
follow
him
if
winnie
died
how
did
these
things
happen
laurence
was
almost
like
a
murderer
for
a
moment
she
envied
him
then
in
her
terrible
emptiness
she
felt
herself
more
beautiful
than
he
mad
i
going
mad
he
does
know
laurence
wanted
to
get
away
from
her
his
expression
of
life
was
always
bitter
and
cheap
and
he
knew
it
but
he
was
rather
proud
of
the
exquisiteness
which
made
it
unendurable
for
him
to
tell
the
truth
to
himself
he
despised
alice
for
the
brutal
veracity
of
her
introspection
alice
carried
pain
of
self
like
a
banner
he
felt
that
her
arrogant
suffering
showed
a
want
of
fineness
to
dare
to
see
as
she
did
he
felt
one
must
be
emotionally
dull
winnie
was
false
and
puerile
but
because
he
felt
that
the
truth
would
kill
winnie
she
seemed
to
him
more
delicate
and
beautiful
than
alice
alice
recognized
that
laurence
hated
her
because
she
understood
him
too
well
she
could
not
comprehend
this
she
would
have
let
herself
be
known
even
in
utter
contempt
she
was
clouded
now
with
the
murk
of
herself
that
no
one
would
know
she
wanted
to
be
known
to
be
cleansed
winnie
was
tired
of
the
country
that
left
her
too
much
with
herself
she
hated
the
empty
road
in
the
bleak
days
and
the
black
tree
at
the
end
that
swayed
against
the
damp
green
twilights
she
was
glad
when
price
agreed
that
it
was
time
for
them
to
go
back
to
the
city
they
left
the
farmhouse
at
night
price
had
sent
his
car
out
and
in
it
they
were
driven
to
the
station
ten
miles
away
it
was
moonlight
the
pine
trees
along
the
road
tossed
their
green
hair
in
the
wind
the
long
boughs
swept
the
ground
the
trees
clutched
the
earth
with
their
roots
as
if
in
a
frenzy
they
would
not
give
way
at
the
deserted
station
one
light
burned
over
the
window
where
the
telegraph
operator
worked
they
sat
for
a
long
time
in
the
dim
waiting
room
until
the
big
train
fiery
and
terrible
rushed
out
of
nothing
and
came
to
a
standstill
at
the
end
of
the
platform
when
they
went
into
the
long
dim
car
hung
with
green
curtains
every
one
was
asleep
price
helped
her
daughter
to
undress
and
winnie
lay
down
on
her
side
in
the
lower
berth
with
the
window
shade
up
as
she
lay
there
and
the
train
began
to
move
the
oppression
of
the
last
few
weeks
culminated
in
her
emotions
in
an
unreasoning
panic
and
she
imagined
that
she
was
already
dead
it
was
foggy
the
train
passed
through
a
railway
yard
and
winnie
saw
rows
of
empty
cars
long
and
low
that
were
like
monsters
with
lusterless
hides
and
opaque
eyes
submerged
in
mist
hundreds
of
dull
eyes
stared
from
the
dimly
shining
windows
the
pale
eyes
of
the
cars
delicate
bridges
floated
over
her
head
as
the
train
passed
beneath
them
and
the
swinging
arms
of
derricks
and
huge
machines
lifted
through
the
mist
were
as
frail
as
lace
lights
burst
against
the
mist
like
rotted
stars
and
there
were
other
lights
that
opened
upon
her
suddenly
glad
and
unseeing
as
the
eyes
of
blind
men
raised
in
delight
the
moon
small
with
distance
slimed
over
with
fog
was
green
like
money
lost
a
long
time
the
telegraph
wires
stretched
across
the
pale
landscape
tautly
like
harpstrings
one
after
another
the
flat
branched
poles
seemed
to
open
submissive
palms
to
the
passing
train
winnie
wanted
the
morning
she
wanted
to
get
back
to
mamma
farley
and
her
familiar
commonplace
before
expanding
in
voluptuous
rebellion
winnie
wanted
to
know
that
the
cage
was
sure
somehow
mamma
farley
made
her
more
certain
of
its
sureness
in
the
morning
they
alighted
in
the
teeming
station
and
winnie
anxious
not
to
be
seen
walked
a
little
behind
price
winnie
was
ashamed
of
herself
she
felt
herself
cold
and
isolated
in
the
vividness
of
the
life
she
contained
at
the
big
gate
at
the
end
of
the
track
they
met
laurence
well
winnie
well
mrs
price
winnie
looked
up
at
him
with
eyes
shuddering
in
softness
she
showed
him
her
helplessness
against
which
he
could
not
defend
himself
when
she
lifted
her
mouth
he
had
to
kiss
her
she
was
ashamed
of
his
shabby
clothes
laurence
tried
to
say
something
to
price
you
look
well
yes
and
winnie
has
gotten
along
very
nicely
with
me
how
is
your
mother
how
are
the
children
she
did
not
look
at
him
and
while
she
talked
she
moistened
her
lips
that
were
like
paper
under
her
tongue
in
the
waiting
room
they
met
price
he
had
arrived
at
the
train
a
few
moments
late
and
the
confusion
of
the
incoming
crowd
had
carried
them
past
him
before
he
knew
it
he
was
gruff
and
short
with
laurence
farley
he
turned
quickly
to
winnie
well
winnie
you
back
are
you
how
is
she
vivien
mother
and
i
are
going
to
keep
a
tight
hold
on
you
my
young
lady
we
are
going
to
see
that
your
health
is
taken
care
of
after
this
you
let
us
take
you
and
winnie
home
in
the
carriage
price
said
to
laurence
i
have
a
taxicab
for
winnie
mrs
price
he
took
winnie
arm
she
protested
a
little
it
seems
so
absurd
price
demurred
preserving
her
poise
but
plainly
irritated
laurence
pretending
not
to
hear
dragged
winnie
on
winnie
pouted
and
hung
back
you
come
to
see
me
this
afternoon
mother
she
called
over
her
shoulder
price
nodded
and
smiled
it
was
sunday
winnie
had
fallen
sick
and
to
escape
the
feeling
of
tension
that
prevailed
at
home
laurence
went
into
the
country
for
a
long
walk
winnie
might
die
then
what
in
the
sense
of
oppression
he
experienced
the
thought
of
winnie
danger
awoke
something
in
him
which
he
refused
to
recognize
which
was
like
a
stealthy
and
terrible
hope
of
relief
he
walked
on
immersed
in
himself
scarcely
realizing
that
he
moved
then
the
ardor
of
his
imaginings
subsided
in
the
familiar
contours
of
being
and
he
saw
the
road
again
stretching
before
him
like
a
shadowed
light
and
the
pale
trees
standing
away
on
either
side
against
the
dim
enormous
sky
laurence
wondered
if
he
had
grown
suddenly
old
formerly
without
articulating
it
he
had
experienced
a
sense
of
immanence
on
every
hand
now
he
felt
dry
and
exhausted
in
his
nameless
understanding
everything
remained
outside
him
he
had
lost
the
power
of
enlarging
his
being
from
his
numbness
he
regarded
enviously
what
he
considered
the
illusions
of
others
and
yet
his
exhaustion
seemed
to
him
the
sum
of
life
and
he
could
not
but
consider
with
contempt
all
those
who
imagined
that
there
was
anything
further
only
the
horror
that
was
between
winnie
and
himself
gave
him
a
little
life
the
hideousness
of
his
fatherhood
made
his
apathy
glow
a
little
like
an
illumined
grimace
through
sheer
irrelevance
it
seemed
to
have
some
meaning
he
began
to
depend
on
this
ugly
fact
of
the
child
he
did
not
want
yet
he
could
not
bear
to
be
in
the
sickroom
where
winnie
was
her
sweetly
pathetic
commonplace
was
so
grotesquely
familiar
that
he
could
scarcely
endure
to
be
aware
of
it
close
to
the
sense
of
what
she
held
in
these
days
she
was
keenly
dramatizing
herself
she
glanced
stealthily
sidewise
at
the
mirror
and
the
madonna
look
came
into
her
face
when
bobby
and
may
were
beside
her
she
drew
them
within
her
thin
little
arms
and
pressed
them
to
her
breast
with
an
air
of
ecstasy
and
reverence
but
she
did
not
care
to
have
them
close
to
her
for
long
and
if
they
fell
into
some
childish
dispute
she
called
in
a
peevish
complaining
voice
for
mamma
farley
and
said
that
no
one
considered
her
or
remembered
that
she
was
sick
when
laurence
reached
home
after
his
walk
it
was
eleven
he
passed
through
the
still
house
and
up
the
stairs
to
the
bedroom
wondering
if
winnie
were
asleep
when
he
opened
the
door
he
saw
the
light
shining
on
her
where
she
lay
on
the
lounge
with
her
eyes
shut
her
mop
of
reddish
hair
was
tangled
about
her
face
turned
to
one
side
on
the
pillows
the
gold
edges
of
her
lashes
rested
delicately
on
her
shadowed
cheek
she
heard
laurence
and
stirred
with
a
nauseous
sense
of
inevitability
he
waited
for
her
to
turn
upon
him
her
look
of
conscious
sweetness
you
were
gone
so
long
laurie
she
blinked
at
him
and
smiled
drowsily
yes
he
said
i
went
for
a
long
walk
she
made
a
little
mouth
i
been
back
such
a
little
while
i
think
you
ought
to
leave
me
when
it
sunday
laurie
you
like
me
better
if
you
do
see
too
much
of
me
his
joke
was
stiff
he
looked
as
though
his
false
smile
hurt
him
winnie
gazed
at
him
her
mouth
began
to
quiver
i
get
so
lonesome
laurie
mamma
farley
goes
off
with
bobby
and
may
and
alice
is
always
poked
away
in
her
room
he
did
not
answer
this
it
cold
in
here
mother
should
have
let
the
fire
die
down
he
walked
over
to
the
grate
and
with
his
fingers
laid
some
lumps
out
of
the
scuttle
upon
the
hot
coals
keep
that
shawl
around
you
winnie
had
i
better
call
mother
and
tell
her
to
help
you
to
get
to
bed
he
came
back
to
her
she
did
not
speak
to
him
tears
rolled
from
her
open
eyes
and
left
wet
smears
along
her
lifted
face
all
worn
out
eh
he
touched
her
hair
uncomfortably
i
call
mother
she
always
knows
what
to
do
for
you
i
do
she
clung
to
his
hand

do
hate

like
this
do

be
foolish
winnie

out
or

way
he
put
her
gently
from
him
i
going
to
call
mother
she
began
to
sob
you
want
to
go
i
do
want
you
to
touch
me
if
you
hate
me
smiling
wearily
he
looked
at
her
it
was
a
kind
of
relief
to
him
to
be
unable
to
defend
himself
since
i
make
you
cry
i
think
i
better
go
winnie
oh
she
sobbed
you
make
me
cry
by
not
wanting
me
you
hurt
me
so
you
so
cruel
still
he
stood
helpless
not
touching
her
for
your
own
sake
you
must
stop
winnie
if
if
you
call
mamma
farley
in
here
now
i
i
kill
myself
no
you
wo
winnie
his
voice
shook
but
if
you
do
want
me
to
call
her
i
wo
winnie
became
a
little
calmer
then
she
said
more
soberly
you
neglect
and
despise
me
i
do
winnie
you
do
she
sat
up
quickly
her
eyes
insisted
on
his
reply
do
you
believe
that
does
my
life
really
indicate
that
to
you
her
little
face
was
hard
you
do
things
for
me
she
contended
but
it
not
because
you
love
me
his
smile
faltered
he
shrugged
wearily
it
would
be
hopeless
for
me
to
attempt
to
justify
myself
winnie
but
for
the
sake
of
your
health
and
your
baby
he
looked
at
her
straightforwardly
we
must
try
to
overcome
this
continual
bickering
she
looked
steadily
with
her
dissolving
gaze
against
his
unpenetrated
eyes
oh
i
wish
my
children
did
belong
to
you
she
said
suddenly
he
glanced
away
from
her
if
i
thought
you
and
the
children
could
do
without
me
i
might
agree
to
resign
my
parental
rights
he
said
with
a
slight
sneer
she
pressed
her
hands
together
regarding
him
in
silence
finally
she
said
oh
i
know
you
be
glad
to
she
was
crying
soundlessly
he
does
not
love
me
she
felt
sorry
for
herself
she
felt
the
slightness
of
her
body
and
the
fragileness
of
her
bones
she
was
new
and
real
to
herself
in
her
illusion
of
smallness
that
made
it
easier
for
her
to
relinquish
her
pride
she
turned
her
face
from
him
and
lay
back
on
the
pillow
again
voluptuously
she
was
conscious
of
her
weakness
with
infinite
and
exquisite
contempt
she
loved
herself
laurie
her
fingers
picked
the
cover
she
did
not
look
at
them
but
she
knew
them
little
and
thin
and
remembered
how
small
they
were
when
he
held
them
in
his
clumsiness
wo
you
kiss
me
laurie
hating
himself
for
his
helplessness
he
leaned
over
her
and
kissed
her
she
lifted
her
arms
to
him
oh
laurie
when
i
sick
and
you
feel
this
way
if
i
should
die
i
could
bear
it
she
said
but
you
wo
die
winnie
you
wo
die
he
gave
up
leaning
his
face
against
her
hair
why
could
they
never
touch
he
felt
the
child
stir
in
her
against
him
and
the
child
seemed
so
terrible
and
real
that
he
longed
for
some
terrible
realness
in
them
with
which
to
understand
the
child
winnie
felt
the
child
stirring
between
them
and
was
ashamed
it
kept
her
from
remembering
sweetly
the
slightness
of
her
body
and
the
smallness
of
her
pretty
outstretched
arms
she
was
ugly
and
inert
at
the
mercy
of
the
child
love
me
laurie
she
moaned
i
ca
help
being
like
this
she
was
unfair
to
him
but
the
agony
in
her
voice
was
sweet
to
her
stop
winnie
you
have
no
right
to
say
things
like
that
he
could
not
speak
any
more
he
held
her
close
up
against
him
to
herself
she
was
small
and
ugly
with
child
in
a
small
dark
room
she
kissed
his
hair
stiff
and
bitter
against
her
mouth
she
envied
him
the
wonder
of
the
fear
he
felt
for
her
but
while
there
was
resentment
in
her
it
elated
her
to
inspire
this
horror
of
pity
small
and
weak
as
she
was
her
hands
were
the
hands
of
joy
and
agony
she
was
jealous
of
her
closeness
to
death
half
afraid
that
the
doctor
was
wrong
she
wanted
to
be
in
danger
secretly
her
weakness
fed
on
its
new
strength
dear
laurie
she
said
tenderly
he
kissed
her
again
i
worried
until
i
not
fit
to
be
with
you
winnie
he
said
then
he
got
up
i
call
mother
you
must
go
to
sleep
with
tears
in
his
eyes
he
smiled
at
her
good
night
laurie
dear
her
voice
was
stifled
in
tears
but
she
smiled
too
when
he
went
out
and
she
was
alone
in
the
room
the
recollection
of
his
pained
face
made
her
feel
that
he
had
taken
something
from
her
that
belonged
to
her
that
she
was
incapable
of
holding
after
christmas
winnie
was
moved
into
the
back
room
over
the
kitchen
because
it
was
warmer
for
her
so
there
were
a
rag
carpet
here
an
cherry
bedstead
and
a
chest
of
drawers
on
the
flowered
wall
beside
the
bed
hung
a
german
print
which
represented
a
gamekeeper
who
had
caught
some
children
stealing
apples
it
was
a
very
old
print
with
a
cracked
glass
the
children
in
the
picture
had
strange
oldish
faces
the
girls
wore
long
skirts
and
the
boy
had
pants
the
gamekeeper
with
and
red
raddled
cheeks
was
dressed
in
a
high
hat
a
short
brown
waistcoat
and
tight
trousers
to
the
right
of
him
in
the
foreground
of
the
scene
two
little
dachshunds
stood
sedately
at
attention
winnie
stared
at
the
picture
until
she
hated
it
sharp
specks
of
light
flecked
the
worn
green
shades
that
darkened
the
windows
the
room
faced
east
and
at
four
winnie
watched
the
sun
set
over
the
dim
purple
housetops
then
it
was
a
flat
white
metal
disk
with
a
harsh
rim
of
whiter
fire
but
half
an
hour
later
it
was
only
a
pinkish
welter
around
which
floated
wispy
clouds
that
looked
burning
hot
like
feathers
dipped
in
molten
by
five
everything
had
disintegrated
in
the
lilac
dust
of
twilight
the
doctor
advised
winnie
that
in
order
to
avoid
a
premature
confinement
she
must
move
about
as
little
as
possible
but
she
was
so
bored
when
she
was
alone
that
she
sometimes
put
on
a
fancy
house
gown
powdered
her
nose
and
went
downstairs
every
one
by
an
exaggerated
consideration
seemed
determined
to
make
her
aware
of
her
state
as
she
walked
she
was
obliged
to
sway
grotesquely
backward
to
balance
the
weight
she
carried
before
her
when
she
passed
the
long
mirror
in
the
parlor
and
saw
herself
hideous
and
inflated
she
burst
into
tears
her
mother
was
often
at
the
house
and
there
was
nothing
so
sickening
to
winnie
as
the
sweet
platitudes
which
price
was
constantly
uttering
the
dear
little
baby
price
would
say
what
a
wonderful
thing
it
is
to
be
a
mother
her
flat
face
was
alight
with
the
sickish
reflection
of
a
memory
that
was
growing
dim
farley
with
no
more
animation
was
less
refined
and
winnie
could
say
things
to
the
which
the
mother
would
not
have
listened
to
for
some
reason
it
satisfied
winnie
to
discuss
her
condition
with
irrelevant
vulgarity
she
hated
her
family
for
dedicating
her
to
this
sordid
thing
every
minute
of
her
life
there
was
something
false
in
their
heightened
regard
of
her
which
existed
because
she
was
sick
and
weak
she
had
become
accustomed
to
feeling
the
baby
move
in
her
its
life
had
become
definite
and
independent
of
her
it
lay
in
her
complete
as
though
it
had
no
right
there
yet
her
mother
in
particular
talked
as
though
the
child
were
a
hope
and
a
wonder
still
in
dream
as
though
they
must
keep
their
hearts
fixed
upon
it
and
pray
it
into
being
it
seemed
to
winnie
that
her
life
was
being
taken
away
and
given
to
the
child
there
was
almost
a
frenzy
about
farley
attention
to
work
she
got
up
at
half
past
five
in
the
morning
and
in
the
still
gray
dawn
when
the
grass
in
the
back
yard
was
silver
with
rime
she
took
out
the
ashes
in
a
big
bucket
and
emptied
them
into
the
bin
in
the
alley
the
gray
dust
settled
on
her
uncovered
hair
but
she
did
not
seem
to
know
it
stiff
locks
sticky
with
dirt
hung
about
her
grimed
face
her
flannel
waist
was
half
out
of
the
band
of
her
draggled
skirt
her
hands
crimson
at
the
knuckles
and
grained
with
the
filth
of
labor
clutched
the
ash
can
stiffly
farley
knew
his
wife
abstraction
was
intended
as
a
rebuke
to
him
but
he
wanted
to
hide
behind
it
her
continually
averted
face
bewildered
him
and
at
the
same
time
left
him
grateful
his
life
had
been
ruined
he
had
sacrificed
everything
and
now
he
was
offered
the
opportunity
to
escape
since
helen
had
left
the
city
again
the
project
for
their
future
which
had
been
forced
into
his
mind
appeared
to
him
as
a
dream
out
of
which
he
had
been
allotted
the
impossible
task
of
making
reality
his
wife
concentrating
herself
upon
household
things
seemed
to
him
strong
and
natural
she
had
ground
under
her
feet
she
had
selected
the
carpet
she
walked
on
it
was
hers
when
he
passed
through
a
room
where
she
was
at
work
and
she
swept
dust
into
his
eyes
he
did
not
rebel
the
grit
in
his
eyes
was
the
truth
of
her
right
he
had
no
carpet
and
no
house
in
which
to
make
his
dream
he
knew
that
even
though
he
had
bought
the
house
it
was
hers
because
she
wanted
it
in
his
uncertainty
he
was
ashamed
before
her
because
her
wants
were
so
definite
and
limited
sometimes
in
his
confusion
he
passed
judgment
upon
himself
before
he
knew
whom
it
was
that
he
judged
in
a
panic
he
tried
to
find
some
sure
conception
of
himself
to
hold
against
the
ebb
and
flow
of
his
irresolution
winnie
precarious
health
gave
him
the
loophole
he
needed
until
the
baby
was
born
he
must
hold
in
abeyance
the
contemplation
of
his
own
affairs
he
owed
it
to
her
poor
little
winnie
he
often
said
i
miss
her
so
when
she
is
not
at
meals
she
should
be
the
first
thought
of
all
of
us
now
we
should
let
our
individual
problems
go
until
we
can
see
her
through
her
trouble
his
wife
understood
that
he
was
excusing
himself
for
what
he
had
not
done
in
the
beginning
of
their
disagreement
when
she
was
frightened
with
the
strangeness
of
her
situation
she
had
waited
in
a
numb
agony
of
quiescence
for
the
first
legal
steps
to
be
taken
nothing
had
occurred
and
she
still
waited
but
there
was
furtive
listening
in
her
attitude
she
listened
and
in
spite
of
herself
was
glad
the
gas
jet
was
shaded
so
that
the
glow
fell
only
on
half
the
bed
where
the
footboard
made
darkness
like
an
echo
on
the
wall
winnie
supper
untasted
was
in
a
tray
on
a
chair
tea
black
with
long
standing
and
shriveled
toast
on
a
chipped
plate
on
the
chest
of
drawers
glasses
and
medicine
bottles
marked
themselves
in
separate
blackness
against
the
blank
brilliant
wall
in
front
of
them
was
a
china
holder
with
a
bent
candle
beside
which
some
one
had
laid
the
core
of
an
apple
about
the
big
the
frame
of
purplish
wood
was
rich
with
satin
reflections
but
the
glass
it
surrounded
was
gray
and
still
and
mirrored
a
part
of
the
bed
and
the
german
print
as
though
they
were
a
long
way
off
the
fire
had
burned
low
and
the
room
was
hot
and
had
a
close
smell
winnie
wore
a
thick
cotton
nightdress
with
long
sleeves
ruffles
of
coarse
embroidery
set
stiffly
away
from
her
thin
wrists
she
felt
herself
hot
and
light
against
the
cold
pillow
and
the
cold
damp
linen
the
window
shades
were
up
and
she
could
see
the
moonlight
faint
outside
the
moonlight
grew
in
the
room
as
the
fire
died
down
the
steady
burn
of
the
gas
flame
was
cold
like
liquid
glass
flowing
over
the
dark
winnie
feet
grew
cold
she
began
to
shiver
the
cold
crept
up
her
legs
under
her
nightdress
it
was
like
grass
growing
up
her
the
fire
in
the
grate
sputtered
and
flared
out
again
it
grew
too
bright
it
stung
her
the
brightness
flowed
into
her
eyes
until
they
were
like
hot
pools
and
she
could
not
see
when
farley
came
to
take
the
tray
away
winnie
had
a
high
fever
and
beach
had
to
be
called
in
the
same
evening
it
was
four
in
the
afternoon
in
winnie
bedroom
the
window
was
slightly
lifted
to
let
in
the
soft
spring
air
the
room
was
flooded
with
an
glow
pink
dots
of
sunlight
moved
on
the
wall
the
polished
chest
of
drawers
and
the
cherry
bedstead
were
a
deep
rich
red
there
were
lilac
shadows
on
the
cool
sheets
hollowed
by
upraised
knees
the
picture
of
the
gamekeeper
dissolved
in
pale
sunshine
winnie
was
sunk
in
a
dream
when
a
sudden
pain
widened
her
eyes
she
sat
up
astonished
for
she
knew
what
the
pain
meant
it
was
like
a
challenge
the
child
had
come
to
wrestle
with
her
the
pain
came
again
and
she
clenched
her
fists
until
the
nails
made
little
red
in
her
soft
full
palms
she
had
closed
her
eyes
but
when
she
opened
them
they
shone
with
a
new
and
fierce
aliveness
winnie
spread
her
toes
out
tensely
against
nothing
each
time
the
pain
came
to
her
she
seemed
to
know
the
whole
world
with
her
hips
and
thighs
then
she
lay
back
exhausted
feeling
knowledge
ebb
away
in
the
tingling
peace
of
relief
when
farley
came
into
the
room
to
carry
away
the
soiled
lunch
tray
winnie
was
unable
to
speak
but
the
shifting
determined
eyes
of
the
older
woman
gave
one
quick
glance
and
guessed
what
had
come
about
farley
ran
out
and
called
beach
and
price
on
the
telephone
later
she
remembered
laurence
winnie
was
aware
of
the
confusion
in
her
room
she
even
understood
that
the
physician
and
her
mother
were
discussing
whether
or
not
she
should
be
moved
to
a
hospital
but
in
the
reality
of
suffering
their
voices
and
faces
were
unreal
if
there
had
been
no
surcease
winnie
could
not
have
borne
it
but
just
when
she
felt
that
she
could
endure
least
pain
went
out
of
her
like
a
quenched
light
and
she
sank
faintly
as
if
into
a
memory
of
herself
it
had
grown
dark
a
shaded
lamp
was
lit
a
nurse
had
come
from
the
hospital
and
price
and
farley
were
sent
out
the
nurse
was
a
tall
woman
with
a
plump
sallow
face
and
small
confident
eyes
her
nose
was
fat
with
widened
nostrils
that
were
slightly
inflamed
her
peaked
cap
set
up
very
high
on
her
untidy
gray
hair
when
she
walked
her
starched
skirt
rattled
like
paper
she
came
and
stood
by
the
bedside
and
was
harsh
and
still
like
the
shadows
on
the
wall
beach
was
a
stooped
man
with
a
bald
head
and
inscrutably
professional
eyes
in
his
shirt
sleeves
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
winnie
bed
rattling
the
chain
on
his
vest
or
looking
at
his
watch
and
coughing
occasionally
sometimes
he
spoke
to
the
nurse
in
an
undertone
when
he
laid
his
cold
hand
covered
with
blond
hair
on
winnie
warm
flesh
she
shuddered
to
his
touch
she
hated
the
assertive
hand
on
her
demanding
her
back
out
of
pain
the
heavy
hand
weighed
down
her
glory
and
she
sank
back
dimmed
the
bent
candle
on
the
chest
of
drawers
made
another
black
bent
candle
behind
it
on
the
wall
back
of
the
row
of
medicine
bottles
were
other
bottles
that
seemed
never
to
have
moved
since
the
world
began
the
pictures
had
each
their
separate
stillness
of
shadow
the
print
of
the
german
gamekeeper
floated
drowned
on
the
gray
becalmed
glass
opposite
a
heavy
breath
bellied
the
shade
before
the
window
and
swung
it
slowly
inward
then
it
relaxed
heavily
into
its
place
against
the
sill
outside
the
moonless
night
as
if
choked
with
quiet
crowded
up
from
the
empty
street
when
winnie
lifted
her
lids
a
little
they
showed
only
the
lower
rim
of
the
irises
beach
examined
the
purplish
nails
on
her
cold
hands
and
felt
her
pulse
uneasily
suddenly
winnie
clutched
at
the
nurse
hands
and
with
eyes
open
and
unseeing
uttered
shriek
after
shriek
the
sick
woman
was
lost
in
pain
as
in
a
wilderness
her
hands
and
feet
were
strange
the
bed
was
strange
in
the
vast
bed
so
far
from
one
end
to
the
other
she
had
lost
her
feet
she
knew
there
was
blood
on
her
the
world
poured
from
her
molten
the
nurse
put
the
chloroform
cap
over
winnie
nose
then
her
head
detached
itself
from
her
body
and
floated
over
the
bed
her
head
danced
like
a
golden
thistle
on
a
pool
of
blood
her
lightness
expanded
she
was
vastly
light
and
the
body
in
the
bed
in
the
dark
pool
grew
still
and
small
and
far
off
she
was
pale
and
angry
with
joy
but
through
the
mist
of
herself
something
leaped
angrily
upon
her
and
dragged
her
to
earth
hot
claws
sank
into
her
she
sank
nerveless
in
the
infinite
darkness
she
was
in
bed
again
the
vast
bed
stretched
from
side
to
side
of
the
unseen
sky
and
oscillated
like
a
ship
not
enough
chloroform
she
wanted
to
tell
them
but
they
were
too
far
away
they
could
not
have
heard
she
saw
the
bright
things
in
the
doctor
bag
then
long
claws
of
steel
she
wanted
to
scream
her
tongue
and
lips
were
wool
she
knew
that
far
away
out
of
the
darkness
which
did
not
belong
to
her
something
warm
and
moist
slipped
the
child
emerged
from
the
blackness
in
which
she
was
still
caught
the
child
passed
from
the
torture
which
went
on
without
it
farley
it
over
you
can
rest
the
nurse
leaned
close
winnie
felt
the
nurse
breath
dry
and
hot
as
a
sirocco
blown
on
her
cold
ear
across
the
dark
what
did
it
matter
to
the
rocking
dark
that
the
child
was
born
her
wrists
floated
her
heart
strained
and
gathered
itself
as
if
for
its
most
profound
joy
but
the
great
joy
to
which
she
opened
slowly
transfigured
itself
an
ugly
and
living
shudder
ran
through
her
the
joy
refused
her
at
the
instant
in
which
she
knew
it
entirely
she
ceased
to
be
her
heart
stopped
beating
she
fell
back
noiseless
the
nurse
with
the
child
in
her
lap
sat
by
a
porcelain
basin
cleansing
the
baby
with
a
big
sponge
beach
called
her
and
she
laid
the
baby
in
the
new
crib
while
she
went
quickly
for
farley
when
the
nurse
had
returned
and
beach
was
working
attempting
to
revive
winnie
laurence
came
into
the
room
he
saw
the
excitement
and
helplessness
of
the
doctor
once
eyelids
seemed
to
twitch
then
laurence
leaned
forward
with
a
curious
unconscious
eagerness
he
asked
for
only
one
thing
he
wanted
to
know
that
winnie
was
dead
stealthily
and
suspiciously
he
watched
the
corpse
hating
the
small
relaxed
body
that
had
tortured
him
with
its
suffering
he
wanted
to
know
that
there
was
no
more
pain
part
iv
farley
had
taken
the
baby
with
its
crib
into
the
nursery
she
was
seated
in
a
low
rocker
crying
by
the
nursery
fire
when
may
woke
up
roused
from
sleep
by
her
grandmother
sobs
may
saw
farley
with
trembling
lips
that
seemed
withered
by
grief
lifting
her
head
and
swaying
her
thin
body
one
knotted
hand
clutched
to
her
breast
as
if
in
unendurable
pain
what
the
matter
grandma
farley
may
asked
when
she
could
endure
the
mystery
no
longer
she
was
like
an
inquisitive
little
animal
expecting
to
be
beaten
but
determined
to
gain
its
end
farley
pretended
not
to
have
heard
she
was
ashamed
because
she
did
not
know
how
to
explain
her
suffering
to
the
child
is
is
anybody
sick
grandmother
is
mamma
worse
may
asked
again
with
piping
persistence
she
saw
the
crib
and
some
vagueness
in
it
curiously
agitated
what
that
she
said
excitedly
farley
rose
stiffly
her
figure
half
black
and
half
shining
against
the
firelight
her
spectacles
glinted
where
they
were
fastened
on
her
untidy
flannel
waist
her
old
black
skirt
was
glossed
green
where
the
fireshine
caught
in
its
folds
the
gray
down
on
her
cheek
glistened
like
a
mist
separate
strands
of
her
hair
were
threads
of
metal
hot
and
bright
on
her
head
she
turned
and
looked
at
may
a
small
vague
figure
across
the
room
in
the
white
bed
may
eyes
with
their
dilated
pupils
were
quick
even
in
the
shadow
farley
fumbled
her
hands
painfully
along
the
folds
of
her
skirt
go
to
sleep
go
to
sleep
child
she
said
in
a
voice
harsh
with
fear
day
was
breaking
around
the
dark
edges
of
the
lowered
shades
livid
squares
of
light
were
widening
against
the
wall
with
a
stealthy
gesture
may
sunk
into
the
bedclothes
again
and
pulled
the
cold
sheet
up
to
her
chin
but
her
eyes
alive
in
her
pale
little
face
over
the
edge
of
the
quilt
followed
her
grandmother
movements
covertly
farley
thought
she
heard
a
sound
from
the
crib
and
went
swiftly
to
it
may
quivering
with
eagerness
sat
up
again
what
that
grandmother
farley
bent
lower
over
the
crib
her
voice
choked
that
your
new
little
brother
she
said
may
delighted
by
the
excitement
and
puzzled
and
interested
by
her
grandmother
tears
threw
the
covers
away
from
her
and
clutching
the
rail
at
the
side
of
the
bed
pulled
herself
to
her
naked
knees
so
that
she
could
look
i
want
to
see
grandma
farley
she
begged
i
want
to
get
out
she
had
already
slipped
one
bare
leg
over
the
bar
and
was
half
way
to
the
floor
get
back
into
bed
this
instant
may
you
take
cold
and
wake
bobby
too
farley
lifted
the
baby
all
wrapped
in
blankets
and
carried
it
to
may
bedside
without
sympathy
and
with
the
impersonal
curiosity
of
a
child
the
little
girl
stared
at
the
baby
small
sharp
features
and
dull
bluish
unrecognizing
eyes
she
was
accustomed
in
examining
picture
books
to
see
fat
children
with
round
faces
and
she
thought
it
did
not
resemble
a
baby
whose
is
it
is
it
mamma
she
asked
where
did
she
get
it
can
i
touch
it
she
laid
a
small
finger
on
the
bundle
then
drew
back
with
a
shudder
of
alienation
how
can
you
bear
to
touch
it
grandma
farley
could
not
speak
she
began
to
cry
again
an
involuntary
of
astonishment
parted
may
lips
when
she
saw
the
small
tears
gather
in
the
dirty
corners
of
her
grandmother
eyes
and
slip
along
the
flaccid
shriveled
cheeks
and
finally
fall
in
gray
spots
of
moisture
on
the
flannel
in
which
the
baby
was
wrapped
farley
felt
that
she
should
tell
may
something
about
her
mother
but
did
not
know
how
to
begin
go
to
sleep
you
wake
bobby
show
you
the
baby
in
the
morning
it
morning
already
may
pointed
out
after
a
minute
farley
moving
away
with
averted
face
glanced
at
the
gray
luminousness
which
stole
under
the
shade
and
blanched
the
wainscot
no
matter
if
it
is
she
said
it
not
morning
for
you
go
to
sleep
hesitating
may
clung
to
the
bedrail
but
she
slipped
at
last
into
the
sheet
soon
after
in
spite
of
her
resistance
she
had
fallen
asleep
again
and
lay
breathing
deeply
and
evenly
with
her
lips
parted
in
dreaming
interest
laurence
went
out
of
the
death
chamber
into
the
hall
where
the
gray
light
of
the
cold
spring
morning
came
dimly
from
the
street
through
the
transom
a
milk
cart
stopped
outside
he
could
hear
the
clatter
of
tins
as
it
came
to
a
halt
and
the
hurrying
feet
of
the
driver
running
down
the
area
steps
and
up
again
bottles
were
jostled
together
with
a
dull
clink
the
man
outside
whistled
the
horse
shoes
chimed
on
the
cold
hard
street
and
the
milk
wagon
rumbled
away
the
noises
blurring
in
distance
there
were
more
footsteps
dull
methodic
one
man
called
to
another
there
was
a
musical
shiver
of
breaking
glass
curses
uttered
in
a
hoarse
male
voice
and
the
flat
thud
of
running
feet
laurence
opened
the
front
door
and
looked
into
the
street
above
the
dull
housetops
were
stone
blue
clouds
the
arc
light
burning
over
the
pavement
opposite
was
like
a
ball
of
pale
unraveling
silk
on
the
windows
of
the
houses
with
their
lowered
blinds
the
sunless
day
was
reflected
in
livid
brightness
he
could
not
bear
the
light
and
he
turned
back
into
the
house
into
the
darkened
parlor
where
the
leaves
of
plants
on
the
stand
in
the
corner
seemed
to
burn
with
a
bluish
fire
he
could
see
the
begonia
leaves
like
pink
hairy
flesh
and
the
gray
fur
of
fern
fronds
the
long
pier
glass
in
darkness
was
like
black
silver
it
was
as
though
he
had
never
seen
himself
move
formlessly
forward
on
its
surface
he
was
cold
he
could
not
stay
there
softly
and
quickly
he
went
out
into
the
hall
and
mounted
the
stairs
again
he
put
his
hand
on
the
knob
of
the
bedroom
door
and
fancied
that
it
swung
inward
of
itself
beach
had
gone
but
the
nurse
was
still
in
the
room
she
had
her
back
turned
to
the
door
and
was
folding
up
some
clothes
the
gas
flame
had
been
extinguished
the
window
curtains
were
open
objects
in
the
room
were
plainly
visible
throwing
no
anchorage
of
shadow
about
them
laurence
went
toward
the
bed
he
set
his
feet
down
carefully
as
if
he
were
afraid
of
being
heard
when
he
reached
her
he
saw
she
had
not
moved
she
would
never
move
a
sob
of
agony
and
relief
shook
him
from
head
to
foot
the
nurse
coughed
discreetly
scarcely
aware
of
it
he
heard
her
starched
dress
rustle
and
her
shoes
creak
as
she
tiptoed
out
he
knelt
down
by
the
bed
the
last
hour
of
winnie
suffering
was
yet
real
and
terrible
to
him
he
pulled
the
sheet
back
from
her
face
she
had
not
moved
she
was
dead
stillness
revolved
about
him
in
eternal
motion
winnie
lay
in
the
center
of
quickness
she
was
dead
he
wanted
to
rush
out
of
the
circle
filled
with
her
warmth
the
stillness
revolved
again
she
held
her
pain
shut
in
her
he
would
never
know
it
again
he
hated
to
leave
the
room
where
the
silence
was
quick
out
of
the
silence
his
pain
was
waiting
to
grasp
him
about
winnie
the
house
revolved
in
wider
and
wider
circles
at
the
edge
of
which
her
quickness
died
away
he
threw
himself
into
the
vortex
of
her
terrific
quiet
it
caught
him
and
twisted
him
and
bore
him
to
its
center
he
was
dead
he
would
never
live
again
he
became
one
with
the
endless
word
she
was
timeless
in
the
bed
in
silence
when
laurence
stumbled
into
the
hall
he
came
upon
his
father
well
son
i
do
know
what
to
say
my
god
i
do
know
what
to
say
farley
turned
away
sobbing
laurence
was
numbed
to
the
sound
of
his
father
words
and
waited
for
the
echo
of
silence
to
die
away
they
walked
downstairs
and
into
the
alice
was
in
the
room
and
and
price
were
both
there
seated
near
a
window
it
was
like
a
holiday
christmas
or
easter
to
see
the
family
together
in
the
early
morning
in
the
artificial
illumination
laurence
covered
his
face
alice
went
over
to
him
and
patted
his
shoulder
you
must
eat
some
breakfast
laurie
the
kindness
in
her
voice
hurt
him
he
wanted
to
go
away
but
she
took
his
hand
and
he
was
too
sick
to
rebel
against
her
so
he
let
her
lead
him
forward
through
the
portières
into
the
next
room
where
the
table
was
set
may
and
bobby
had
been
dressed
early
and
seated
at
table
for
they
were
going
for
the
day
to
a
neighbor
house
over
her
brown
serge
dress
that
was
becoming
too
short
and
tight
may
wore
a
fancy
clean
white
apron
the
bow
on
her
hair
was
of
her
best
red
ribbon
but
it
was
already
half
untied
and
dangled
in
a
huge
loop
above
one
of
her
ears
bobby
too
was
in
a
new
blue
woolen
blouse
he
was
bibless
and
the
porridge
he
was
eating
trickled
in
gluey
drops
of
milk
and
sugar
over
his
chin
and
down
his
dickey
he
could
not
get
it
out
of
his
head
that
this
was
a
celebration
and
several
times
he
had
asked
aunt
alice
where
the
presents
were
may
was
discreet
enough
to
attend
to
her
food
but
she
ate
slowly
and
methodically
and
was
in
no
hurry
to
leave
when
she
saw
her
father
led
in
by
aunt
alice
as
if
he
were
a
blind
man
it
seemed
a
part
of
the
general
strangeness
and
excitement
may
understood
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
her
mother
yet
her
information
was
too
meager
to
project
anything
but
vague
images
in
her
mind
at
one
moment
the
unexpectedness
of
it
all
elated
her
her
eyes
shone
she
shuddered
with
happiness
and
her
drawers
were
wet
but
the
exaltation
produced
by
the
sense
of
mystery
was
followed
by
depression
tears
gathered
among
her
lashes
and
rolled
down
her
cheeks
as
she
realized
that
her
father
was
crying
too
after
the
children
had
been
sent
away
the
embalmer
arrived
and
went
upstairs
and
when
the
wreath
was
hung
on
the
door
it
seemed
almost
as
if
winnie
had
died
again
the
house
now
stood
out
from
other
houses
what
the
family
had
wanted
to
conceal
like
a
shame
was
revealed
to
the
world
their
grief
no
longer
belonged
to
themselves
when
they
went
to
a
window
and
looked
out
their
differentness
separated
them
infinitely
from
the
people
in
the
street
they
were
crushed
by
their
consciousness
of
separateness
the
day
was
interminable
toward
evening
in
the
twilight
they
sat
in
the
huddled
in
their
chairs
relaxed
by
emotion
they
looked
drunk
their
gestures
as
they
shifted
their
postures
limply
were
the
gestures
of
debauch
with
bleered
vague
eyes
they
peered
spiritlessly
at
one
another
out
of
the
shadows
the
sun
had
gone
down
and
there
was
only
a
chilly
whiteness
in
the
center
of
the
room
and
in
front
of
the
windows
in
the
gloom
the
drunken
people
floated
in
their
senseless
grief
like
fish
they
stirred
languidly
or
they
got
up
took
some
aimless
steps
and
resumed
their
places
no
one
suggested
a
light
they
were
ashamed
of
their
exhaustion
and
their
dry
eyes
in
terror
of
not
caring
enough
they
began
to
talk
dwelling
on
harrying
details
in
order
to
wring
from
each
other
the
stimulus
which
would
draw
a
little
moisture
from
their
dry
lids
really
they
were
sick
with
fatigue
they
wanted
to
sleep
they
made
themselves
tense
against
weariness
they
did
not
know
whether
if
they
made
a
light
brightness
would
rouse
them
from
their
disgraceful
torpor
or
merely
reveal
their
plight
farley
who
had
been
in
the
death
chamber
came
downstairs
and
when
he
stumbled
over
a
stool
by
the
door
of
the
room
he
lit
the
gas
then
the
reddish
glow
made
of
their
swollen
inflamed
faces
they
saw
each
other
and
found
that
they
could
cry
again
the
tears
came
peacefully
now
without
effort
their
strength
flowed
from
them
under
their
lids
their
heads
floated
confusedly
above
the
bodies
to
which
they
were
secured
by
their
attenuated
necks
in
which
they
were
conscious
of
the
nausea
and
indigestion
of
weakness
the
contemplation
of
so
much
misery
left
farley
as
weak
as
jelly
but
in
the
very
completeness
of
his
mental
and
physical
depletion
he
felt
relief
at
the
moment
when
he
descended
from
the
room
where
the
dead
woman
lay
to
the
strange
twilight
inhabited
by
her
sodden
family
he
gave
up
he
no
longer
attempted
to
escape
from
his
vision
of
himself
with
a
feeling
of
luxury
he
admitted
his
incapacity
for
change
he
was
brazen
in
his
inward
confession
of
failure
his
ideals
were
too
high
they
could
never
be
realized
in
this
life
he
could
not
go
back
he
had
a
sense
of
utter
humiliation
and
failure
yet
at
the
same
time
was
subtly
grateful
for
his
degradation
the
fumes
of
fatigue
permitted
a
vague
indulgence
to
his
he
put
helen
away
from
him
forever
death
was
a
bitterness
and
a
peace
alice
had
set
out
some
cold
meat
on
the
table
in
the
but
no
one
thought
to
eat
from
somewhere
in
the
cold
a
fly
came
and
buzzed
feebly
about
the
frayed
meat
on
the
big
sheep
bone
that
lay
disconsolately
in
a
congealed
pool
of
grease
in
the
middle
of
the
glossy
blue
dish
no
one
came
into
the
the
teapot
covered
at
first
with
a
bloom
of
moisture
grew
heavy
and
drops
of
water
collected
at
its
base
the
young
fly
clung
to
the
huge
flayed
bone
of
the
dead
beast
it
crawled
on
moist
quivering
legs
along
the
dry
and
fleshless
parts
only
to
slip
back
uncertainly
when
it
clutched
at
the
fat
in
the
empty
it
was
as
if
the
silence
had
stripped
the
burned
flesh
from
the
dead
bone
the
gas
light
shone
very
bright
on
the
stupidity
of
the
table
at
which
no
one
sat
the
tablecloth
was
white
and
lustrous
from
the
iron
the
chairs
stood
vacantly
about
the
vacant
meal
the
dry
highly
polished
tumblers
and
the
plates
the
coffin
was
on
a
table
in
the
parlor
it
had
a
movable
inside
which
was
pushed
up
so
that
the
shoulders
and
head
of
the
corpse
protruded
above
the
box
stiffly
yet
as
if
of
themselves
the
head
and
shoulders
of
the
corpse
uprose
from
the
sides
of
the
coffin
the
smooth
strange
face
like
the
face
of
a
wax
angel
rose
up
complaisantly
above
the
sides
of
the
box
the
german
woman
at
the
bakery
who
was
out
of
bed
with
a
child
ten
days
old
had
come
to
act
as
for
the
other
child
in
the
nursery
opposite
the
death
chamber
she
sat
pressing
the
infant
lips
to
the
stiff
brown
nipple
on
her
full
white
breast
it
caught
the
nipple
weakly
and
hungrily
but
it
did
not
have
the
strength
to
keep
it
the
brown
teat
sloppy
with
saliva
fell
from
its
small
strained
mouth
the
baby
squeezed
its
thumbs
under
its
wrinkled
fingers
its
hands
half
opened
and
shut
its
weak
eyes
did
not
see
the
nipple
it
had
lost
and
it
began
to
cry
fretfully
without
shedding
any
tears
the
stout
woman
had
a
sense
of
unusualness
and
impropriety
in
allowing
the
dead
woman
baby
to
take
her
breast
but
she
overcame
the
feeling
before
she
permitted
it
to
become
plain
to
herself
with
firm
fingers
she
pressed
the
stiff
nipple
between
the
slobbering
lips
the
baby
scratched
her
delicate
skin
with
its
soft
nails
its
hands
clutched
in
the
agony
of
its
satisfaction
it
pressed
and
grappled
with
her
resilient
breast
and
left
there
faint
red
marks
of
delight
and
rage
it
was
happy
it
sucked
with
fierce
unseeing
content
its
sightless
eyes
stared
angrily
its
cheeks
were
drawn
in
and
relaxed
unceasingly
when
the
breast
slipped
out
again
it
despaired
its
furry
forehead
wrinkled
above
its
wizened
face
its
opaque
eyes
grew
sharp
and
merciless
with
baffled
desire
like
a
small
blind
beast
fumbling
the
air
it
moved
its
head
searchingly
from
side
to
side
sucking
it
seemed
impossible
for
the
scrawny
and
emaciated
child
to
satisfy
itself
the
woman
took
the
breast
away
and
the
infant
was
angry
once
more
its
eyes
drew
up
out
of
sight
beneath
its
overhanging
lids
its
whole
body
writhed
in
protest
it
was
a
healthy
child
the
woman
said
because
on
the
second
day
it
could
scream
like
that
by
and
by
it
grew
tired
of
its
rage
and
went
to
sleep
it
slept
with
its
lids
apart
like
a
drunken
thing
showing
its
bleared
irises
and
monotonously
vigorously
it
drew
the
air
in
and
out
of
its
mouth
it
seemed
angry
and
merciless
even
in
its
sleep
on
the
way
to
the
distant
cemetery
laurence
rode
in
the
carriage
with
his
father
both
men
were
under
the
illusion
that
the
carriage
remained
fixed
while
the
confused
faces
in
the
streets
were
hurried
past
them
like
bright
leaves
and
driftwood
torn
by
some
hidden
stream
when
the
hearse
came
to
a
halt
near
the
grave
price
in
the
carriage
behind
them
had
to
be
aroused
from
a
stupor
and
assisted
to
her
feet
her
knees
shook
she
gazed
wildly
and
incredulously
about
and
when
they
were
lowering
the
coffin
into
the
hole
she
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
reproach
winnie
my
god
winnie
as
if
she
expected
the
dead
woman
to
rise
in
response
and
give
some
comforting
assurance
laurence
refused
to
see
what
was
going
on
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
bright
ground
and
permitted
himself
to
realize
nothing
more
than
that
though
the
march
day
was
fresh
the
sun
was
warm
on
his
back
but
as
the
minister
last
words
were
said
laurence
felt
the
agitation
of
people
turning
away
and
something
in
him
refused
to
reconcile
itself
to
the
irrevocable
thing
which
had
occurred
recognizing
no
one
he
walked
aimlessly
apart
among
strange
graves
those
who
regarded
him
found
in
him
the
same
fascination
and
repugnance
which
had
pervaded
the
body
as
it
lay
in
the
coffin
in
some
way
he
seemed
to
belong
to
it
among
the
untended
graves
stood
an
unpainted
kiosk
the
dusty
stair
that
led
to
it
yet
littered
with
leaves
of
the
autumn
past
it
was
a
meaningless
thing
empty
like
the
words
on
the
tombstones
words
of
which
the
earth
had
already
hidden
the
meaning
the
wind
blew
very
high
up
the
long
hillside
in
the
cold
still
sun
it
shook
the
stiff
glossy
blades
of
dry
yellow
grass
and
disturbed
the
small
sharp
shadows
that
laced
their
roots
the
bare
trees
rocked
heavily
from
the
earth
and
swung
their
polished
branches
together
on
one
grave
a
faded
cotton
flag
drooped
under
an
iron
star
by
another
was
a
wreath
of
tin
and
wax
white
roses
and
orange
blossoms
soiled
and
spotted
with
rust
in
a
wooden
case
with
a
broken
glass
over
the
top
an
iron
bench
had
sunk
into
the
ground
and
was
fixed
there
with
a
leg
uplifted
in
an
attitude
of
resignation
some
blue
glass
jars
were
filled
with
dried
crocus
buds
and
the
greenish
ooze
of
the
rotting
stems
above
the
hard
twinkling
slope
of
grass
the
sky
was
a
cold
pure
blue
pine
trees
tall
and
conical
were
flaming
satin
dark
against
the
flat
white
burning
disk
of
the
sun
in
a
shining
tree
the
white
sun
burnt
innocently
like
an
enormous
christmas
candle
there
was
happiness
in
the
strong
bitter
smell
of
the
pine
trees
warmed
by
the
sun
the
light
that
floated
thin
between
their
branches
was
sprayed
fine
from
the
circle
of
heat
like
the
stiff
hot
hair
of
an
angel
burning
harsh
and
glorious
as
it
floated
from
a
halo
the
wind
rushed
up
against
the
trees
and
they
stirred
darkly
as
in
a
shining
sleep
the
branches
swayed
crossed
each
other
and
fell
back
among
the
graves
there
were
obelisks
like
paralytic
fingers
stripped
dry
to
the
bone
pointing
up
a
geranium
in
a
pot
was
still
on
a
grave
like
a
red
glass
flame
among
the
tombs
it
slept
encased
in
brightness
a
fruit
tree
in
premature
bloom
was
shedding
its
blighted
petals
heavily
the
tree
weighted
with
white
shed
its
ripe
silence
the
petals
fell
and
mingled
with
the
satin
flakes
of
light
on
the
trembling
grass
the
still
grave
posts
were
deep
in
silence
the
silence
was
asleep
it
did
not
know
itself
silence
crept
waist
high
breast
high
drowned
in
itself
it
was
asleep
when
the
sun
sank
out
from
the
night
from
the
horizon
the
dark
trees
rolled
angrily
the
remote
stars
flashed
blue
sparks
like
a
paler
rage
but
infinitely
deep
from
the
night
of
the
earth
the
tombstones
floated
up
laurence
could
not
believe
in
death
he
did
not
know
it
but
he
was
sick
with
death
because
it
oppressed
his
unbelief
he
wanted
to
take
it
into
himself
and
understand
it
yet
the
same
breath
which
desired
knowledge
was
filled
with
protest
he
wanted
to
get
away
from
the
thing
which
crushed
him
with
its
unknown
being
crushed
him
in
the
blankness
of
the
still
sunshine
and
the
cold
wind
above
the
damp
new
grave
when
he
reached
home
after
the
funeral
the
children
had
come
back
may
clung
about
her
father
because
of
her
fear
of
him
she
seemed
to
know
him
better
than
others
knew
him
for
her
own
sake
he
wanted
her
to
hate
him
to
keep
herself
separate
from
his
pity
of
her
he
felt
his
pity
for
others
in
him
like
a
rottenness
he
would
have
torn
the
sickness
out
of
his
flesh
but
it
was
through
him
decaying
him
his
blood
was
dry
if
he
saw
anything
unworthy
he
immediately
discovered
its
weakness
and
sheltered
it
with
his
contempt
he
could
not
be
clean
and
strong
and
harsh
for
himself
that
was
why
he
could
fight
for
nothing
that
he
wished
because
his
enemies
were
inside
him
and
in
order
to
destroy
them
he
had
to
tear
and
torture
himself
if
the
sickness
in
him
had
been
his
own
he
could
have
cured
it
but
it
was
the
sickness
of
his
children
of
alice
of
his
father
and
mother
as
a
young
man
he
had
never
been
able
to
carry
a
decision
into
effect
since
he
could
never
clearly
distinguish
his
own
pains
from
the
pains
of
those
he
opposed
as
a
boy
his
pride
made
him
suffer
with
a
sense
of
misunderstood
greatness
winnie
had
drunk
that
suffering
out
of
him
he
had
drained
himself
dry
that
her
agony
might
be
rich
winnie
had
drunk
his
want
he
was
empty
his
heart
was
old
he
flung
his
children
away
he
was
free
but
free
was
the
name
of
a
thing
he
had
lost
while
winnie
lived
there
was
a
certain
vividness
in
his
fatigue
his
resentment
of
her
had
held
him
together
he
analyzed
the
family
and
told
himself
that
it
was
a
monster
which
fed
on
pain
it
had
grown
stronger
while
winnie
had
been
weak
and
sick
it
was
yet
stronger
now
that
she
was
dead
when
night
came
he
thought
of
winnie
who
had
always
been
afraid
to
be
alone
left
in
the
dark
and
the
silence
and
the
wet
earth
about
twelve
it
began
to
rain
she
was
more
still
out
there
because
of
the
rain
he
saw
the
plump
stiff
body
happy
in
its
box
the
rain
softened
its
plumpness
the
dead
woman
was
lost
in
the
thick
night
in
the
rain
always
the
night
said
nothing
but
in
one
place
far
off
where
the
grave
was
the
night
became
bright
and
horrible
he
understood
the
night
where
it
came
from
the
grave
in
the
darkness
the
dead
woman
stirred
the
cold
was
bright
in
the
whiteness
of
her
face
here
was
where
the
dark
ended
in
itself
the
rain
fell
upon
her
he
could
not
tear
her
from
the
rain
or
from
his
horror
of
her
he
was
locked
in
his
horror
of
her
as
in
a
perpetual
embrace
she
was
dead
she
lived
in
him
endlessly
never
could
he
be
delivered
except
into
greater
intimacy
forever
he
belonged
to
her
to
her
white
face
with
shut
eyes
to
its
passive
torture
to
its
movelessness
against
rain
he
felt
already
the
day
cold
like
this
still
like
this
when
she
would
have
him
utterly
almost
it
seemed
that
he
remembered
something
one
evening
after
the
children
had
eaten
alice
said
i
undress
the
kiddikins
is
it
time
for
the
baby
bottle
mamma
farley
wanted
to
give
the
baby
his
bottle
but
there
was
meat
burning
in
the
oven
so
she
resigned
the
office
to
alice
if
he
still
asleep
do
wake
him
up
alice
went
upstairs
carrying
the
bottle
in
one
hand
and
holding
fist
with
the
other
may
came
behind
when
they
reached
the
nursery
the
baby
seemed
so
quiet
that
alice
set
the
bottle
on
the
mantel
shelf
and
began
to
undress
bobby
it
was
summery
dusk
in
the
room
outside
the
window
the
city
melted
in
hyacinth
mist
the
gold
lights
in
the
houses
across
the
street
were
still
like
a
row
of
crocuses
everything
else
seemed
to
be
shaken
in
the
trembling
dusk
the
room
quivered
unreal
in
the
half
dark
may
watched
aunt
alice
climb
into
bed
bobby
he
did
say
his
prayers
aunt
alice
well
he
can
say
his
prayers
tomorrow
night
may
knew
that
she
too
would
not
be
allowed
to
say
her
prayers
aunt
alice
was
awful
aunt
alice
in
the
dark
like
a
tower
prayers
seemed
an
incantation
against
an
evil
which
aunt
alice
desired
can
you
undo
your
own
dress
may
squirmed
and
bent
forward
her
hand
reached
up
to
the
first
button
here
at
that
rate
it
will
take
you
all
night
out
of
the
darkness
again
aunt
alice
hand
heavy
and
hot
and
sure
she
clutched
shoulder
and
gave
it
a
little
shake
wriggler
the
clothes
slipped
off
may
felt
her
nakedness
piercing
the
dark
suddenly
aunt
alice
caught
her
and
faced
her
about
naked
as
she
was
what
makes
you
act
as
though
i
were
an
ogress
may
aunt
alice
hands
hurt
may
was
no
longer
aware
that
aunt
alice
existed
separate
from
the
dark
it
was
shadow
itself
that
bit
into
the
flesh
i
i
do
know
may
giggled
her
eyes
shone
with
arrested
tears
did
i
ever
hurt
you
suppose
i
had
pinched
you
like
this
slapped
you
aunt
alice
hand
flew
out
of
the
dark
and
fastened
itself
alive
and
stinging
on
may
cheek
it
was
a
light
slap
almost
in
play
but
may
died
under
it
she
was
stupid
like
a
mirror
she
sobbed
painlessly
what
are
you
crying
for
as
if
i
had
really
hurt
you
may
did
not
care
any
more
so
she
went
on
crying
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
you
wake
the
baby
up
may
cried
hush
i
say
alice
held
may
against
her
breast
in
a
fierce
unkind
smothering
hug
so
that
the
baby
might
not
hear
her
cry
she
uncurled
may
loose
fingers
and
laid
them
against
her
breast
in
the
darkness
she
wanted
may
to
be
conscious
of
breasts
burning
and
unfolding
of
themselves
she
wanted
may
to
help
her
to
understand
her
breasts
may
felt
aunt
alice
big
and
soft
under
her
palm
she
did
not
want
her
she
had
no
name
for
the
feel
of
her
beyond
the
consciousness
of
softness
which
she
did
not
like
she
was
naked
and
chilled
her
palm
sunk
upon
the
big
bosom
where
aunt
alice
pressed
it
and
she
shuddered
away
from
the
yielding
flesh
she
did
not
want
to
know
why
aunt
alice
was
like
that
why
aunt
front
swelled
softly
thick
under
her
fingers
why
aunt
alice
heart
beat
with
a
steady
and
terrible
hammer
here
get
away
from
me
and
put
on
your
nightgown
you
silly
little
girl
may
was
glad
to
be
freed
and
pulled
the
gown
on
her
head
caught
in
the
fabric
but
she
struggled
through
until
finally
her
face
peeped
out
only
a
blind
blur
of
face
in
the
dim
room
get
into
bed
aunt
alice
sounded
sharp
and
commanding
again
may
felt
more
than
ever
she
was
unloved
but
remembering
the
feel
of
the
big
bosom
was
glad
free
may
scampered
across
the
cold
bare
floor
on
her
bare
feet
she
braced
her
toes
in
the
rail
of
the
bed
and
swung
herself
over
then
she
snuggled
down
quick
alice
could
not
shake
off
the
sensation
she
had
had
with
the
little
naked
girl
in
her
arms
the
child
small
thin
nakedness
was
like
a
knife
alice
wanted
the
child
nakedness
to
cut
her
heavy
flesh
into
feeling
she
went
over
to
the
crib
in
the
dark
she
could
feel
the
baby
staring
up
awake
making
no
sound
she
turned
to
the
mantel
shelf
for
the
bottle
and
offered
it
to
his
lips
which
she
could
barely
see
his
small
hands
touched
her
meaninglessly
he
accepted
the
bottle
he
was
content
she
could
hear
him
sucking
she
knelt
by
the
crib
by
the
baby
that
ignored
her
she
gave
herself
to
it
she
betrayed
it
sweetly
oh
baby
she
wept
enjoying
her
shame
she
wanted
to
put
its
hands
in
her
breast
its
lips
in
her
breast
in
the
dark
room
she
wanted
to
tear
off
her
clothes
to
give
the
baby
her
nakedness
but
the
baby
could
not
take
her
it
could
not
show
her
herself
in
time
it
would
give
the
light
of
pain
to
some
one
but
now
it
was
little
with
small
hands
alice
could
not
bear
the
baby
any
more
what
did
she
want
she
went
out
of
the
nursery
and
into
her
own
room
and
closed
the
door
what
did
she
want
she
began
to
pull
her
clothes
off
first
her
blouse
her
skin
prickled
with
chill
the
darkness
was
thick
about
her
it
loved
her
horace
ridge
her
clothes
slipped
off
she
pulled
off
her
shoes
and
stockings
and
the
floor
and
the
slick
matting
knew
her
feet
the
darkness
knew
her
her
body
was
white
and
stiff
against
the
dark
with
a
sensual
agony
she
knew
how
ugly
she
was
horace
ridge
she
could
not
bear
his
name
his
pain
through
the
door
she
could
hear
laurence
and
her
father
talking
as
they
passed
through
the
hall
take
this
body
away
from
me
i
do
not
know
it
i
can
no
longer
bear
the
company
of
this
unknown
thing
she
lay
down
in
the
bed
and
pulled
the
sheets
up
spring
if
mamma
farley
calls
me
to
dinner
she
said
to
herself
i
shall
be
sick
in
the
dark
street
a
boy
whistled
she
heard
girls
laugh
through
the
window
a
tree
over
the
opposite
roof
moved
its
black
foliage
against
the
bloom
of
the
sky
clouds
streaked
with
rose
a
hard
moon
thin
like
a
shell
lay
up
there
glowing
inside
itself
with
a
cold
secret
light
alice
felt
her
body
harsh
like
the
moon
he
did
not
love
me
they
make
me
ugly
because
unmeaning
beauty
straight
white
tall
like
a
temple
you
can
not
be
beautiful
alone
i
open
my
heart
i
take
the
world
to
my
heart
i
am
beauty
but
my
body
is
dark
in
the
temple
alice
alice
waited
a
moment
smothering
i
shall
not
answer
alice
alice
lips
against
the
crack
of
the
closed
door
yes
mamma
did
the
baby
drink
his
milk
yes
dinner
get
cold
alice
put
her
clothes
on
feeling
as
though
she
had
been
sick
why
do
i
go
she
went
downstairs
and
into
the
feeling
lost
in
the
glow
of
the
flame
that
sputtered
above
the
table
there
was
cream
tomato
soup
already
served
a
thick
curdling
a
little
in
the
sweated
plates
hello
alice
good
evening
alice
farley
was
drinking
his
soup
timidly
and
without
enjoyment
surreptitiously
his
blunt
fingers
crumbled
atoms
of
a
crust
he
did
not
look
at
his
wife
but
his
eyes
searched
the
faces
of
his
children
warily
have
your
beef
rare
laurence
farley
asked
yes
laurence
said
casually
his
mother
always
served
him
first
he
stretched
his
legs
under
the
table
he
sat
heavily
in
his
chair
as
if
he
had
fallen
there
he
took
big
gulps
of
soup
and
tilted
his
dish
then
he
began
to
wipe
butter
from
his
knife
on
a
ragged
piece
of
bread
there
was
a
kind
of
satisfaction
of
disgust
in
all
he
did
i
hear
ridge
is
dangerously
ill
alice
his
eyes
were
hard
with
curiosity
as
he
glanced
at
her
but
not
unsympathetic
well
alice
gave
him
a
combative
stare
if
you
threatening
to
express
any
satisfaction
about
it
please
keep
your
mouth
shut
i
was
never
down
on
ridge
personally
he
has
written
some
fool
books
but
i
am
every
sorry
to
hear
that
he
is
sick
i
better
write
to
him
and
give
him
your
sympathy
no
need
to
be
sarcastic
alice
laurence
said
farley
coughed
in
spite
of
the
impracticability
of
his
views
sure
none
of
us
wish
ridge
out
of
the
way
alice
frayed
the
edges
of
her
slice
of
beef
by
futile
jabs
with
her
fork
but
she
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
eat
suddenly
these
people
became
intolerable
to
her
she
rose
without
a
word
and
walked
out
of
the
room
they
stared
at
her
disappearing
back
what
the
matter
alice
laurence
called
he
got
up
glancing
at
his
mother
shall
i
go
after
her
farley
had
so
hardened
in
her
determination
to
keep
silence
that
it
was
difficult
for
her
to
speak
of
commonplace
matters
leave
her
alone
she
said
in
a
grating
voice
laurence
shrugged
and
sat
down
again
she
probably
feels
that
we
are
not
sympathetic
in
regard
to
ridge
farley
said
he
smiled
painfully
and
apologetically
no
i
do
think
we
are
said
laurence
comfortably
farley
had
shut
herself
up
again
alice
went
out
through
the
kitchen
and
stood
in
the
back
yard
it
was
foggy
close
to
the
earth
the
street
lamps
beyond
the
high
back
wall
diffused
their
brightness
in
the
thickness
of
the
night
so
that
the
darkness
seemed
atingle
with
a
whitish
blush
the
light
from
the
open
door
behind
her
streamed
out
and
cut
the
darkness
with
a
blade
where
it
fell
the
grass
was
milk
rich
and
thick
with
color
alice
walked
to
the
alley
gate
and
fumbled
with
the
cold
latch
until
she
had
opened
it
fog
lay
in
the
lamplit
alley
like
a
bright
breath
up
and
down
the
street
beyond
the
cold
roofs
were
heavy
on
the
solid
houses
their
dead
finality
was
like
a
threat
against
the
vague
and
living
dark
alice
felt
as
though
she
were
rushing
out
of
herself
like
an
unseen
storm
she
wanted
to
lose
her
body
in
the
dark
but
at
the
end
of
the
alley
people
were
passing
and
she
could
see
the
square
turgid
as
a
river
where
lights
of
cabs
and
automobiles
floated
trembled
disappeared
and
reappeared
again
she
was
in
terror
of
them
she
no
longer
wanted
to
be
known
to
herself
she
turned
and
shut
the
gate
and
ran
back
up
the
walk
to
the
house
the
kitchen
was
vacant
bare
a
moth
spun
in
near
the
quivering
gas
flame
on
the
stove
the
pots
and
pans
crusted
with
food
leaned
together
half
upset
there
was
white
oilcloth
on
the
table
and
on
the
floor
a
scrap
of
threadbare
red
carpet
bread
was
making
in
a
covered
bowl
on
a
shelf
back
of
the
stove
the
baby
clothes
which
farley
had
been
ironing
hung
in
a
corner
on
a
line
on
a
chair
the
bread
board
was
laid
out
with
a
heel
of
bread
and
a
large
knife
alice
picked
up
the
knife
she
wanted
to
cleave
her
vision
of
herself
but
she
must
cleave
it
surely
she
was
afraid
she
dropped
the
knife
and
at
the
clatter
almost
ran
from
the
room
she
went
quickly
but
very
softly
up
the
creaking
back
stairway
her
breath
was
choking
and
guilty
she
remembered
where
laurie
kept
his
pistol
and
she
passed
into
his
room
and
fumbled
in
the
bureau
drawer
among
his
clothes
when
she
had
the
pistol
in
her
hand
suddenly
she
felt
sure
of
herself
she
did
not
want
to
do
it
now
not
that
night
she
was
ashamed
of
having
left
the
and
decided
to
go
downstairs
once
more
before
she
went
she
carried
the
pistol
to
her
room
and
hid
it
she
felt
calm
for
the
first
time
it
seemed
as
if
her
whole
body
was
hers
as
in
a
love
embrace
she
was
not
afraid
of
understanding
it
she
rested
in
relief
in
intimacy
with
herself
nothing
separated
her
from
herself
alice
threw
a
gray
woolen
bathrobe
about
her
over
her
nightgown
and
went
downstairs
to
get
the
morning
paper
sunlight
came
over
the
transom
of
the
street
door
and
blue
motes
floated
down
a
spreading
ladder
of
light
the
light
and
the
whirling
motes
sank
into
the
soft
dingy
nap
of
the
carpet
as
into
a
vortex
there
was
a
deep
spot
of
radiance
putty
colored
like
a
pool
of
dust
still
in
the
gloom
alice
opened
the
door
and
took
the
paper
in
as
she
carried
it
upstairs
the
steps
creaked
under
her
short
broad
bare
feet
she
went
into
her
room
the
folded
paper
was
slick
and
cold
it
rattled
as
she
opened
it
her
eyes
ran
over
the
columns
and
the
gray
print
seemed
to
shift
and
dance
and
come
together
like
the
broken
figures
in
a
kaleidoscope
horace
ridge
was
dead
she
laid
the
paper
on
the
bed
the
paper
seemed
a
strange
thing
the
room
the
bed
the
chairs
were
words
what
she
knew
had
no
word
she
felt
exalted
almost
happy
she
dressed
and
put
on
her
hat
and
placed
laurie
pistol
in
her
bag
when
she
shut
the
pistol
in
the
bag
she
had
a
foolish
feeling
that
she
was
doing
something
irrelevant
but
her
reason
told
her
that
she
had
to
have
it
when
she
opened
the
front
door
a
second
time
she
knew
that
mamma
farley
was
up
because
the
milk
bottle
had
been
taken
in
the
street
had
been
washed
and
smelt
sweet
a
child
trundled
a
baby
carriage
up
and
down
the
block
the
carriage
went
through
the
wet
and
left
gray
glistening
tracks
where
the
concrete
had
already
dried
some
negro
workmen
in
huge
clumsy
coats
and
shoes
went
by
alice
closed
the
door
softly
behind
her
she
had
a
vague
idea
that
she
would
go
to
the
cemetery
where
winnie
was
buried
she
would
take
the
train
a
short
distance
and
walk
the
rest
of
the
way
she
reached
the
station
it
was
full
of
stopped
clocks
marking
the
hours
of
appointed
departures
the
stopped
clocks
and
the
stir
of
people
in
the
shed
made
one
feel
that
the
world
had
stopped
the
motionless
agitation
reminded
one
of
the
restless
stillness
of
the
dead
it
was
very
dirty
an
employee
in
a
blue
denim
jacket
pushed
a
trash
receiver
along
the
platform
and
carelessly
swept
up
some
piles
of
fruit
peel
and
cigarette
stubs
and
smeared
over
places
where
people
had
spit
alice
walked
through
the
gate
and
out
to
the
track
sunshine
came
through
the
roof
of
the
shed
and
burned
the
cinders
like
black
diamonds
the
atmosphere
had
a
palpable
texture
and
was
acrid
with
smoke
an
engine
rushed
down
upon
her
steaming
and
shining
the
red
cars
were
covered
with
a
film
of
dust
that
made
them
orange
bright
the
windows
glittered
alice
climbed
into
the
long
car
filled
with
grimy
green
plush
seats
and
sat
down
by
a
window
that
was
smeared
along
the
ledge
with
cinders
people
came
in
girls
men
a
woman
with
a
crying
baby
their
faces
too
looked
wan
and
orange
in
the
bright
clear
morning
sunlight
the
train
started
feeling
it
move
alice
was
terrified
it
seemed
to
her
that
already
something
had
begun
which
she
could
not
control
it
was
as
though
the
train
were
carrying
her
out
of
herself
fields
swept
by
there
was
a
marsh
where
the
water
twinkled
with
a
moving
shudder
among
the
still
reeds
then
came
an
aqueduct
on
a
hill
were
red
brick
houses
set
with
shimmering
glass
and
above
the
cold
roofs
the
raw
green
of
fresh
leaves
against
the
cold
pure
blue
of
the
morning
sky
a
station
with
a
neat
park
about
it
another
station
alice
rose
and
swayed
forward
down
the
aisle
of
the
moving
train
at
the
next
stop
she
got
out
it
was
lonely
the
station
house
was
a
little
deserted
brick
building
of
only
one
room
alice
walked
along
the
dusty
road
between
the
wet
bright
fields
it
was
going
to
rain
the
sky
was
clotted
with
cloud
through
the
vapors
the
illumined
shadows
of
the
sun
rays
were
outspread
like
shadowy
fingers
of
fire
by
itself
close
to
the
road
was
a
whitewashed
wooden
church
and
a
bush
with
leaves
burnt
up
against
it
in
beauty
and
derision
alice
felt
all
at
once
that
she
could
go
no
further
she
took
out
the
pistol
she
looked
all
about
her
she
was
suddenly
ashamed
feeling
as
though
she
were
playing
a
dangerous
game
she
held
the
pistol
to
her
breast
she
wanted
the
pistol
to
go
off
but
she
was
afraid
to
pull
the
trigger
she
tried
the
cold
ring
of
metal
against
her
temple
she
felt
herself
ridiculous
vainly
she
attempted
to
recall
winnie
in
the
coffin
horrible
and
gone
forever
she
sat
down
limply
on
a
grass
bank
by
the
roadside
the
gray
motionless
foliage
of
the
trees
grew
thick
and
cumulus
against
the
rainy
sky
in
her
lax
hand
she
held
the
pistol
stupid
pistol
which
could
no
longer
convince
her
of
its
purpose
it
lay
inertly
on
her
palm
that
rested
among
the
long
gray
grasses
brushed
flat
to
the
earth
with
their
dull
crystal
weight
of
dew
death
she
kept
repeating
the
bright
word
to
herself
she
was
dead
she
could
not
believe
in
death
she
stood
up
and
shook
her
skirts
and
put
the
pistol
in
the
bag
she
felt
stupid
and
sick
her
boots
were
all
over
dust
and
burrs
clung
to
her
petticoats
she
hardly
saw
what
was
around
her
she
had
never
felt
such
heaviness
in
her
life
she
walked
back
and
sat
down
in
the
dirty
little
until
a
train
should
come
already
she
fretted
against
herself
she
did
not
believe
in
death
she
could
not
hurt
herself
enough
she
felt
herself
grow
mean
and
hard
and
withered
in
her
unbelief
she
went
back
part
v
laurence
felt
cleaner
and
happier
in
his
attitude
toward
winnie
than
he
had
ever
been
able
to
feel
when
she
was
alive
he
did
not
go
to
the
cemetery
very
often
but
he
saw
to
it
that
there
were
flowers
planted
in
the
plot
and
that
the
place
was
well
cared
for
he
was
cold
and
still
inside
himself
his
soul
had
been
turned
to
iron
and
he
weighed
carefully
in
the
scales
of
justice
what
had
been
done
by
her
and
what
by
him
he
refused
to
pity
her
or
himself
but
this
could
not
last
his
justice
began
to
live
and
to
ache
with
the
pain
of
its
own
decisions
then
he
threw
it
all
away
it
was
only
when
he
allowed
himself
to
despise
winnie
thoroughly
that
he
could
love
her
he
would
not
be
killed
with
remorse
his
children
were
his
greatest
pain
he
was
so
close
to
bobby
that
his
pride
in
the
child
was
only
a
hurt
laurence
was
harsh
with
the
child
and
before
strangers
did
nothing
but
find
fault
one
day
bobby
dropped
his
toy
engine
out
of
the
window
and
when
it
fell
in
the
street
a
bad
boy
ran
off
with
it
bobby
came
crying
to
his
father
but
laurence
would
give
no
sympathy
if
may
cried
like
that
nobody
would
be
surprised
laurence
said
why
did
you
go
out
and
make
the
boy
give
it
back
he
would
div
it
back
he
wanted
it
bobby
bored
his
scrubby
fists
into
his
streaming
eyes
his
sobs
were
futile
and
rebellious
go
out
and
take
it
away
from
him
next
time
you
let
some
little
ragamuffin
in
the
street
run
off
with
your
toys
do
come
to
me
about
it
may
would
probably
let
anybody
that
wanted
to
run
off
with
the
dearest
thing
that
she
possessed
but
that
no
excuse
for
you
bobby
was
so
angry
that
for
a
moment
he
forgot
to
cry
he
did
not
understand
his
father
cross
words
but
they
were
not
what
he
wanted
and
he
hated
them
unmoved
in
her
humility
may
heard
herself
deprecated
she
accepted
contempt
as
the
poor
take
dirt
her
father
tolerant
disapproval
lay
on
her
ugliness
but
she
could
not
think
how
she
would
be
without
it
and
yet
he
never
scolded
her
when
her
grandmother
was
provoked
with
her
he
only
said
leave
her
alone
you
ca
change
her
and
he
always
petted
her
but
may
knew
wordlessly
that
he
was
only
kind
to
her
she
was
humble
something
inside
her
died
faintly
it
was
like
a
death
at
the
end
of
a
sickness
a
relief
which
she
dimly
felt
as
defeat
yet
she
was
fond
of
her
father
she
was
glad
he
did
not
scold
her
she
would
run
to
meet
him
when
he
came
home
from
work
and
cling
delightedly
with
her
little
claws
to
his
strong
small
hands
mostly
she
was
unaware
of
the
tightening
and
stiffening
of
his
wrist
and
of
his
readiness
to
loose
her
when
she
let
her
palm
slip
from
his
she
was
even
oblivious
to
the
contrast
presented
by
the
spontaneity
of
his
brusque
affection
for
bobby
it
was
only
now
and
then
as
by
some
unnamed
sixth
sense
she
knew
that
he
was
not
wanting
her
touch
then
she
would
draw
back
bewildered
and
ashamed
of
herself
but
neither
sad
nor
angry
and
would
find
herself
in
her
stupidity
weltering
in
that
same
shadow
which
was
always
on
her
soul
whether
he
forgot
it
or
not
however
if
he
was
willing
to
forgive
her
if
he
felt
contrite
for
what
he
had
shown
and
held
out
his
hand
to
her
her
heart
immediately
lifted
she
was
up
above
herself
in
the
sure
definite
outlines
of
his
world
and
she
was
glad
she
clapped
her
hands
and
danced
there
was
not
a
spark
of
jealousy
or
reproach
in
her
too
yielding
nature
laurence
half
concealing
it
from
himself
despised
her
subconscious
forgiveness
but
since
he
could
do
nothing
to
improve
his
relation
with
her
he
was
very
generous
with
candy
and
sweets
and
playthings
the
baby
could
sit
up
now
propped
against
pillows
it
was
fat
and
well
it
had
pallid
skin
and
red
blond
hair
its
heavy
cheeks
hung
forward
and
between
them
was
sunk
its
droll
loose
mouth
very
red
and
wet
its
very
blue
eyes
conveyed
neither
pleasure
surprise
nor
recognition
as
yet
but
it
showed
anger
and
even
delight
with
its
hands
and
arms
and
its
body
that
was
long
with
fat
bowed
legs
it
liked
best
to
sit
in
the
bath
its
weak
back
supported
by
its
grandmother
hand
and
strike
the
clear
green
surface
of
the
water
with
its
stiff
outspread
palm
laurence
never
in
his
heart
admitted
a
relation
with
the
baby
the
child
disconcerted
him
he
was
ashamed
of
his
intimacy
with
it
and
that
it
took
him
for
granted
when
he
leaned
toward
it
it
held
out
its
fat
arms
with
their
creased
wrists
and
went
to
him
it
sat
unsteadily
on
his
knee
the
blond
hair
on
its
head
was
furry
and
lustrous
and
grew
down
the
flat
length
of
its
skull
at
the
back
into
the
thick
fold
of
its
neck
as
it
moved
its
body
its
head
bobbled
as
though
it
were
about
to
topple
off
when
laurence
touched
the
baby
delicate
skin
he
found
it
always
damp
with
a
cold
fragrant
sweat
and
if
he
pressed
the
flesh
it
mottled
with
color
like
a
bruise
with
an
eager
gesture
it
would
reach
out
and
clutch
his
watch
chain
it
liked
to
jerk
and
dangle
the
chain
sometimes
laurence
teased
it
and
it
fretted
laurence
said
that
the
baby
was
stupid
of
course
he
ca
know
you
he
only
four
months
old
farley
defended
indignantly
laurence
sentimentalized
his
mother
devotion
to
the
baby
but
that
did
not
alter
his
own
reaction
the
child
made
no
appeal
to
him
he
gave
it
back
to
the
grandmother
he
did
not
want
it
near
him
for
long
at
a
time
occasionally
when
he
leaned
over
the
carriage
and
let
its
fingers
stray
through
his
stiff
hair
he
lost
himself
in
the
feeble
touch
of
its
hands
it
knew
nothing
it
did
not
care
it
was
almost
as
if
it
loved
him
without
knowing
him
and
somehow
he
wanted
to
be
loved
like
that
it
relieved
him
of
himself
eh
you
little
beggar
he
would
exclaim
floundering
with
the
foolish
word
and
he
would
shake
its
clutching
finger
roughly
as
the
baby
stared
at
him
it
made
a
happy
sound
its
soul
sweet
and
a
little
blank
lay
on
the
surface
of
its
eyes
and
there
was
something
awesome
in
its
stupid
naked
little
looks
among
the
grown
people
who
had
forgotten
how
to
be
naked
like
that
even
with
themselves
laurence
flushed
and
his
eyes
dimmed
with
emotion
the
softness
and
helplessness
of
the
baby
took
his
male
self
he
wanted
to
do
something
for
it
he
could
not
even
buy
it
a
sweet
poor
little
thing
poor
little
thing
he
murmured
to
himself
however
the
definiteness
of
his
responsibility
toward
it
was
a
relief
to
him
in
the
unsettled
state
of
his
life
it
was
five
months
after
winnie
death
before
laurence
began
frankly
to
consider
his
freedom
and
what
he
should
do
with
it
it
came
over
him
suddenly
and
he
knew
that
he
must
have
been
thinking
of
it
before
without
having
realized
it
it
made
him
feel
unreal
and
as
if
he
did
not
even
belong
to
himself
any
more
the
children
had
his
mother
and
winnie
parents
and
required
no
sacrifice
of
him
he
tried
to
stir
himself
to
rebel
against
the
children
he
might
go
abroad
and
leave
them
and
do
some
of
the
things
which
had
been
impossible
before
he
could
not
do
it
he
did
not
want
to
enough
his
disgust
with
himself
gave
him
a
sort
of
peace
he
flowed
out
of
himself
in
his
despair
like
a
thing
too
full
that
has
been
relieved
his
spirit
was
sodden
there
was
nothing
he
wanted
nothing
he
wanted
to
do
and
yet
he
played
with
the
idea
of
departing
from
his
present
life
he
talked
vaguely
about
himself
in
a
way
that
disturbed
secretly
growing
peace
of
mind
she
gave
him
side
glances
but
she
did
not
dare
to
show
openly
that
there
was
anything
to
fear
laurence
deliberately
allowed
his
dress
to
become
more
and
more
untidy
when
he
met
a
woman
in
a
bus
or
a
car
he
was
consciously
impolite
then
all
at
once
he
saw
himself
inwardly
and
knew
that
women
were
troubling
him
that
he
had
not
actually
eliminated
them
in
his
desires
so
he
went
one
day
and
found
a
prostitute
and
as
if
it
were
to
slay
something
in
himself
let
her
take
him
to
her
room
the
experience
did
nothing
for
him
he
came
away
feeling
sore
and
beaten
he
resented
women
he
was
restless
some
unadmitted
thing
wanted
its
own
in
his
life
to
his
father
and
mother
he
began
to
talk
more
than
ever
about
going
to
europe
farley
never
rebuked
him
when
he
talked
of
leaving
her
but
her
mouth
drew
into
a
pucker
and
he
could
see
that
she
cried
he
never
gave
her
any
comfort
when
she
did
this
but
after
he
left
her
it
was
as
though
he
had
been
through
an
illness
which
had
taken
his
strength
her
tears
had
drained
his
determination
he
did
not
care
he
was
dull
he
wondered
what
was
the
matter
with
him
when
laurence
looked
at
his
mother
stooped
back
in
its
dowdy
cotton
dress
and
the
wispy
hair
clinging
to
the
sweated
nape
of
her
yellow
wrinkled
neck
her
verbal
acceptance
of
his
resolution
to
go
abroad
maddened
him
he
was
not
certain
that
he
wanted
to
go
and
he
required
her
articulate
resistance
to
force
him
to
it
instead
she
persisted
in
speaking
to
others
of
laurence
departure
as
though
it
were
already
a
settled
thing
farley
said
i
do
know
i
do
know
you
know
what
you
want
laurence
he
felt
that
no
one
but
himself
understood
growing
old
what
his
wife
knew
of
old
age
he
did
not
regard
as
knowledge
she
was
old
without
understanding
it
he
had
stopped
writing
to
helen
without
ever
having
made
any
definite
proposal
to
her
he
felt
obliged
to
send
her
checks
for
their
boy
but
if
she
did
not
acknowledge
them
though
it
hurt
him
he
was
glad
he
tried
not
to
think
of
her
his
conviction
of
age
was
born
of
knowledge
that
was
deep
in
his
flesh
and
so
it
was
good
it
was
beyond
doubt
it
was
his
he
felt
without
being
able
to
express
it
that
truth
was
at
the
end
of
things
and
that
what
he
had
come
to
now
was
truth
because
there
was
nothing
more
it
was
the
end
of
life
he
felt
that
some
day
it
would
matter
very
little
whether
laurence
went
abroad
or
not
alice
restless
eccentricity
troubled
farley
like
a
dream
but
he
knew
that
her
unrest
would
grow
weak
like
his
own
she
would
know
truth
as
he
knew
it
when
he
left
the
where
he
had
been
with
laurence
and
alice
alice
said
papa
farley
walks
as
though
he
were
a
hundred
maybe
he
is
you
very
cryptic
laurence
i
tired
alice
well
you
have
grown
tired
through
exerting
yourself
on
behalf
of
any
one
else
alice
said
sharply
nor
have
you
i
think
i
done
something
for
children
i
wish
god
had
provided
you
with
a
family
alice
tears
rose
to
alice
dull
ravaged
eyes
she
stared
at
him
helplessly
good
god
she
said
at
last
and
what
are
you
laurence
sat
very
still
and
unmoved
smiling
his
pipe
between
his
teeth
but
his
lip
trembled
in
a
sneer
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
be
expected
to
know
he
said
alice
could
not
bear
him
near
her
she
went
out
her
heavy
hips
swinging
with
a
kind
of
reluctant
determination
under
her
dingy
rough
cloth
skirt
her
broad
fleshy
shoulders
defiantly
set
laurence
noted
familiarly
wondering
why
it
hurt
him
how
her
wet
brown
hair
was
half
combed
tucked
askew
and
that
her
collar
was
off
the
band
of
her
blouse
at
the
nape
of
her
neck
showing
a
patch
of
swarthy
skin
she
rushed
up
the
stairs
and
he
could
hear
her
slam
the
door
of
her
room
he
almost
imagined
he
could
hear
her
shriek
as
he
had
one
time
at
night
when
laurence
talked
to
alice
about
going
away
she
said
good
god
go
anywhere
if
you
had
had
any
guts
you
would
have
gone
before
this
farley
hearing
this
was
afraid
of
alice
violence
yet
hoarded
the
consciousness
of
the
weakness
to
which
it
confessed
alice
face
was
already
debauched
with
some
secret
passion
farley
grew
hard
and
strong
against
it
you
must
mention
ridge
in
alice
presence
she
told
laurence
one
day
when
she
said
it
she
looked
strong
and
secret
they
were
at
table
alice
had
not
come
down
to
dinner
may
had
been
permitted
the
occasion
to
eat
with
her
elders
in
her
small
dumb
face
her
eyes
turned
on
her
grandmother
were
timidly
alive
with
interest
may
face
was
like
a
yellow
pearl
melting
in
its
coldness
with
the
terrified
warmth
of
her
eyes
she
sat
squirming
in
her
chair
smoothing
her
dress
down
over
her
stomach
but
when
her
grandmother
frowned
at
her
she
undid
herself
may
do
you
want
farley
leaned
toward
the
child
may
knew
what
her
grandmother
thought
may
was
in
terrible
fear
of
being
sent
off
to
the
toilet
before
she
could
tell
what
she
had
to
say
aunt
alice
talks
to
herself
she
blurted
out
shrilly
immediately
she
said
it
the
table
surrounded
by
grown
people
melted
away
from
her
and
she
was
in
herself
half
drowned
as
in
a
lake
of
pitch
tingling
with
moonlight
when
may
came
out
of
herself
she
saw
her
grandmother
making
knowing
grimaces
at
laurence
and
grandpa
farley
looking
ashamed
and
unhappy
then
may
was
sorry
she
had
told
about
aunt
alice
how
do
you
know
aunt
alice
talks
to
herself
laurence
asked
may
looked
at
her
father
intensely
like
a
little
surprised
doe
each
experience
to
her
was
unique
and
absolute
like
a
forest
creature
there
was
no
recognition
in
her
seeing
and
because
all
faces
were
strange
to
her
she
knew
them
better
i
i
i
heard
her
lots
of
times
in
her
room
and
when
when
we
were
out
walking
her
small
hand
continued
to
smooth
her
stiff
dress
over
her
hollow
little
belly
and
she
felt
her
ring
burning
a
cold
circle
around
her
finger
ring
that
was
a
pain
and
a
joy
to
her
farley
ashamed
for
alice
played
with
his
fork
farley
said
alice
always
had
a
terrible
temper
and
got
her
feelings
hurt
needlessly
but
i
never
imagined
she
would
develop
the
crazy
morbidness
she
has
shown
lately
farley
could
not
bear
the
talk
about
pain
any
longer
he
got
up
i
think
i
send
alice
her
dinner
he
said
to
no
one
in
particular
he
added
i
have
some
letters
to
write
so
i
wo
wait
until
the
rest
of
you
are
finished
when
farley
was
out
of
hearing
farley
said
pursing
her
lips
you
know
there
was
insanity
in
your
father
family
laurence
yes
you
told
me
once
aunt
celia
then
laurence
frowned
at
his
mother
and
nodded
toward
may
he
hated
his
mother
attitude
toward
alice
but
because
he
loathed
it
he
always
defended
it
what
his
instinct
warned
him
against
he
always
refused
to
give
up
when
his
mother
weakly
resistant
looked
at
him
with
her
unyielding
eyes
it
was
because
of
the
very
shudder
which
it
gave
him
that
he
hardened
himself
to
take
it
he
was
kind
to
her
as
an
apology
for
his
contempt
farley
turned
to
may
fold
up
your
napkin
may
rolled
the
soft
cloth
in
her
little
trembling
hand
she
had
hoped
when
she
spoke
that
her
father
and
grandmother
would
somehow
relieve
her
of
aunt
alice
whom
she
carried
inside
her
so
oppressively
but
now
she
knew
they
would
not
go
upstairs
and
begin
to
undress
yourself
farley
said
yes
may
slid
to
her
tiptoes
her
belly
ached
with
a
kind
of
sickish
hunger
she
went
out
into
the
hall
to
the
foot
of
the
stair
and
laid
her
pale
hand
on
the
cold
slick
rail
which
caught
dim
reflections
from
the
bright
open
door
of
the
she
would
have
to
go
up
alone
past
aunt
alice
door
the
dark
did
not
want
her
because
she
had
told
it
was
white
and
blind
against
her
eyes
quivering
in
every
limb
she
tiptoed
up
the
steps
when
laurence
was
alone
with
his
mother
he
said
a
little
sharply
alice
is
inclined
to
be
a
busybody
and
to
make
herself
generally
obnoxious
mother
but
i
do
believe
her
condition
is
as
bad
as
you
seem
to
imagine
you
must
remember
that
all
old
maids
do
go
mad
farley
kept
her
eyes
away
you
do
see
what
i
do
you
heard
may
alice
has
had
this
curious
obsession
of
trying
to
separate
me
from
her
father
farley
could
not
go
on
she
stood
up
and
began
to
draw
off
the
tablecloth
to
shake
the
crumbs
out
the
gas
jet
hissed
softly
above
them
and
the
white
curtains
before
the
open
windows
were
like
white
stirring
shadows
against
the
thick
night
beyond
laurence
began
to
talk
of
some
indifferent
subject
and
farley
dared
not
bring
him
back
to
the
thing
of
which
she
wished
to
speak
one
afternoon
a
fancy
struck
laurence
to
abandon
work
and
go
out
to
winnie
grave
summer
was
passing
and
it
was
half
cold
again
the
sunshine
was
a
pale
fluid
trickling
across
the
withering
grass
of
the
cemetery
the
maples
were
already
beginning
to
turn
and
their
ghostly
scarlet
leaves
were
like
pale
flattened
flames
he
stood
by
the
grave
and
heard
the
hissing
of
the
wind
through
the
sunny
grass
and
the
rattle
of
husks
in
the
cornfield
that
ran
along
the
cemetery
wall
the
plowed
fields
beyond
were
purple
plush
misted
with
a
fire
of
green
nearer
dirty
brown
sheep
moved
over
the
stubble
between
laurence
and
the
sun
was
glowing
foliage
that
seemed
to
burn
with
a
secret
the
sight
of
the
mound
beaten
in
by
the
autumn
winds
and
already
somewhat
sunken
made
him
sick
when
he
went
home
he
said
to
his
mother
i
some
good
news
for
you
i
given
up
the
struggle
farley
did
not
look
at
him
when
he
said
this
she
was
startled
and
afraid
to
answer
at
once
they
were
in
the
kitchen
and
smiling
a
little
she
stared
before
her
into
the
sink
by
which
she
stood
the
clear
stream
of
water
dancing
with
light
hung
like
a
thread
of
glass
as
it
flowed
slowly
from
the
shiny
spigot
into
the
porcelain
bowl
the
back
door
was
ajar
and
the
smell
of
wet
dying
grass
floated
into
the
room
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
at
last
he
had
seated
himself
in
a
careless
heap
near
the
table
his
eyes
were
bright
and
as
he
gazed
at
her
with
a
sharp
pained
look
seemed
sightless
just
that
i
have
decided
there
is
no
more
escape
from
old
age
in
europe
than
at
coney
island
farley
was
afraid
of
showing
how
relieved
she
was
so
she
asked
do
your
father
and
alice
know
that
dinner
is
nearly
ready
laurence
rose
and
went
out
of
the
room
to
call
them
with
a
shiver
of
wonderment
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
to
watch
his
broad
back
and
rocking
legs
as
he
disappeared
now
he
get
married
again
she
told
herself
farley
did
not
know
what
was
occurring
but
she
felt
herself
growing
strong
again
in
the
house
her
husband
was
coming
back
to
her
he
tried
to
court
her
favor
and
without
appearing
conscious
of
it
she
showed
a
growing
toleration
for
him
winnie
death
she
explained
to
herself
had
shocked
them
into
their
senses
and
she
was
glad
with
a
weak
malicious
gladness
which
she
would
not
admit
to
escape
the
responsibility
of
her
own
emotions
she
began
to
go
to
church
more
frequently
having
god
on
her
side
in
her
humility
she
felt
triumphantly
cruel
but
as
if
to
conceal
her
relief
from
herself
she
developed
an
even
greater
passion
for
than
she
had
hitherto
shown
farley
felt
her
shabbiness
as
a
reproach
to
him
and
he
begged
her
to
buy
clothes
but
she
was
always
able
to
think
of
some
excuse
for
not
doing
so
tonight
when
he
came
into
the
kitchen
he
had
a
large
pasteboard
box
under
his
arm
he
could
not
persuade
her
to
look
at
it
her
hands
were
in
the
rushing
she
would
not
turn
round
if
you
have
bought
me
a
dress
she
said
i
do
want
it
you
know
how
may
needs
school
clothes
and
laurence
seems
to
take
no
responsibility
whatever
for
her
appearance
and
there
that
leaky
ceiling
in
the
bathroom
that
i
have
been
trying
to
get
mended
for
a
month
you
might
have
seen
to
some
of
those
things
before
you
spent
money
on
clothes
for
me
heaven
knows
it
matters
little
enough
to
anybody
whether
i
am
dressed
up
or
not
and
she
added
if
you
insist
on
my
having
clothes
you
should
have
given
me
the
money
to
buy
them
i
could
probably
have
gotten
something
more
economical
and
at
least
been
sure
that
it
fit
farley
listened
to
her
he
had
a
tired
apologetic
smile
almost
ashamed
he
felt
sorry
for
her
and
for
himself
he
was
patient
now
mother
i
think
laurence
and
i
can
promise
you
that
the
bathroom
ceiling
will
be
mended
in
a
few
days
and
if
you
would
only
look
at
the
clothes
you
could
see
whether
they
fit
or
not
and
if
they
did
i
could
exchange
them
it
is
as
if
i
did
appreciate
the
thought
she
stopped
keeping
him
outside
her
outside
her
vague
ungiving
eyes
i
have
to
be
practical
for
the
lot
of
you
she
said
well
mother
you
can
be
as
practical
as
you
like
about
the
house
but
i
want
to
keep
you
looking
nice
she
was
on
the
verge
of
retorting
to
him
but
she
restrained
herself
he
felt
that
she
was
about
to
say
something
which
he
could
not
answer
and
that
it
was
time
for
him
to
leave
her
alone
he
went
out
the
room
was
still
but
for
the
swish
of
the
brush
that
was
making
the
white
sink
glow
with
cleanliness
in
farley
knotted
unsteady
fingers
the
back
of
the
scrubbing
brush
bumped
on
the
sides
of
the
porcelain
bowl
a
fly
buzzed
fiercely
in
the
luminous
dark
against
the
windowpane
then
was
still
like
a
spring
that
had
fiercely
unwound
farley
rested
an
instant
the
brush
slid
from
her
fingers
and
clattered
against
a
dish
she
wiped
her
eyes
with
her
apron
she
was
tired
but
with
weak
patience
victoriously
ungiving
she
held
out
against
life
the
end
