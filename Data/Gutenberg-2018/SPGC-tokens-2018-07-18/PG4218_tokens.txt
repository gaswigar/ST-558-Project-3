guthrie
carey
began
life
young
he
was
not
a
week
over
when
between
two
voyages
he
married
lily
harrison
simply
because
she
was
a
poor
pretty
homeless
little
girl
who
had
to
earn
her
living
as
a
nondescript
in
hard
situations
and
never
had
a
holiday
he
saw
her
in
a
sandridge
slaving
beyond
her
powers
and
made
up
his
mind
that
she
should
rest
with
sailor
zeal
and
promptitude
he
got
the
consent
of
her
father
who
was
glad
to
be
rid
of
her
out
of
the
way
of
a
new
wife
took
the
trembling
clinging
child
to
the
nearest
parson
and
made
her
a
pensioner
on
his
small
wages
in
a
tiny
lodging
of
her
own
they
honeymooned
for
a
fortnight
off
and
on
as
his
ship
could
spare
him
the
happiest
pair
of
mortals
in
the
wide
world
and
then
parted
in
tears
and
anguish
unspeakable
for
the
best
part
of
a
twelvemonth
he
came
back
to
find
himself
a
father
wonderful
experience
for
never
was
such
a
heavenly
mystery
of
a
child
never
such
an
angelic
young
mother
eighteen
and
with
the
bloom
of
that
most
beautifying
convalescence
like
a
halo
about
her
he
was
first
mate
now
with
a
master
certificate
and
a
raised
salary
it
was
time
to
make
a
home
so
while
she
nursed
the
baby
in
sandridge
with
the
aid
of
a
devoted
friend
the
landlady
cousin
guthrie
carey
busied
himself
across
the
way
at
williamstown
fixing
up
a
modest
house
he
also
had
a
devoted
friend
in
the
person
of
a
customs
officer
whose
experienced
wife
took
charge
of
the
operations
lily
was
to
see
nothing
until
all
was
ready
for
her
it
was
to
be
a
pleasant
surprise
the
last
touches
had
been
given
tea
put
in
the
caddy
meat
and
butter
in
the
safe
flowers
in
the
vases
mrs
hardacre
in
her
best
gown
spread
a
festive
and
bill
her
spouse
stood
by
with
a
government
launch
to
take
the
proud
young
husband
to
his
wife
and
to
bring
them
back
together
lily
awaited
him
trembling
tearful
wild
with
the
joy
of
going
home
her
had
come
to
sandridge
to
see
her
off
and
had
brought
her
a
present
of
a
macintosh
on
the
merits
of
which
she
dilated
with
fervour
as
she
twirled
it
round
and
round
buttons
right
down
to
the
feet
she
urged
persuasively
and
cape
hanging
below
the
waist
the
second
mrs
harrison
was
a
big
woman
you
might
go
through
a
deluge
in
it
and
so
stylish
my
dear
you
can
wear
it
when
you
go
out
in
threatening
weather
of
an
afternoon
and
be
quite
smart
well
it
pretty
threatening
now
said
guthrie
uneasily
i
know
that
it
would
be
wiser
oh
no
no
lily
implored
no
trains
tonight
no
way
but
this
guthrie
i
ca
get
wet
in
this
nice
waterproof
i
do
care
how
it
blows
the
more
the
better
with
you
with
me
but
baby
we
can
keep
him
safe
he
is
going
to
be
rolled
in
your
rug
we
can
take
him
inside
if
it
is
cold
oh
we
must
go
by
sea
guthrie
call
this
sea
he
mocked
it
was
sea
to
her
who
had
never
been
beyond
the
heads
she
expected
to
concentrate
in
the
trip
across
the
bay
the
interest
of
years
of
travel
on
land
there
was
nothing
like
blue
water
to
this
sailor
wife
whose
heart
had
been
upon
it
for
so
many
anxious
months
the
extravagance
of
her
partiality
was
the
joke
of
husband
and
friends
against
her
all
right
said
guthrie
come
along
then
he
was
impatient
to
get
her
away
from
these
people
and
under
his
own
roof
the
macintosh
was
again
pressed
upon
her
oh
thanks
thanks
but
i
think
i
wo
put
it
on
just
yet
as
it
is
not
raining
my
dress
is
warm
her
dress
was
the
wedding
dress
chosen
for
use
as
well
as
beauty
a
delicate
pink
stuff
with
a
watered
sash
to
match
in
which
she
looked
like
a
on
day
she
had
a
fancy
to
go
to
her
home
in
state
and
also
to
make
an
appearance
that
would
do
her
husband
credit
before
mr
and
mrs
hardacre
here
is
your
fascinator
my
dear
said
the
motherly
landlady
offering
the
substitute
for
lily
hat
let
me
tie
it
on
for
you
there
the
fascinator
of
white
wool
made
and
adjusted
properly
accounts
for
its
name
and
guthrie
was
sure
that
he
had
never
seen
a
lovelier
picture
than
his
darling
face
in
that
soft
frame
she
was
ready
now
as
ready
as
she
meant
to
be
until
the
customs
launch
had
seen
her
and
turned
to
pick
up
the
large
bundle
that
had
the
little
baby
in
the
middle
of
it
i
carry
him
lily
no
no
mr
carey
i
going
to
carry
him
said
the
landlady
cousin
a
strapping
young
woman
whose
arms
were
equal
to
the
task
as
far
as
the
boat
at
any
rate
she
did
so
the
elder
ladies
supporting
her
on
either
side
guthrie
and
lily
led
the
procession
hand
in
hand
ah
how
like
another
world
it
was
coming
out
upon
that
breezy
platform
from
the
streets
and
how
royal
a
proceeding
it
seemed
to
lily
to
be
the
setting
apart
of
a
government
vessel
solely
and
entirely
to
convey
her
to
her
new
abode
as
if
she
were
a
little
queen
going
to
her
husband
kingdom
she
could
not
help
holding
herself
with
dignity
if
not
with
a
trifle
of
vaingloriousness
as
between
eager
hands
and
admiring
eyes
she
stepped
down
into
it
now
have
you
got
everything
the
landlady
called
from
the
pier
oh
everything
everything
in
the
world
guthrie
shouted
in
reply
where
your
waterproof
lily
screeched
the
better
put
it
on
my
dear
and
i
advise
you
to
sit
under
cover
both
of
you
you
be
drenched
if
you
do
in
this
wind
why
mr
hardacre
blowing
a
perfect
gale
a
bit
fresh
bill
admitted
just
enough
to
keep
us
lively
all
aboard
mr
casey
pass
the
word
sir
when
you
ready
ready
called
guthrie
and
then
he
said
something
to
the
men
bill
hardacre
and
his
mate
dugald
finlayson
about
having
everything
on
board
all
his
life
and
happiness
or
something
to
that
effect
at
which
they
laughed
and
chaffed
him
as
the
launch
backed
from
the
pier
and
started
off
in
the
tearing
hurry
characteristic
of
customs
boats
lily
was
in
the
cabin
with
the
baby
and
the
landlady
cousin
who
had
round
mr
hardacre
to
give
her
a
return
passage
after
seeing
the
little
family
safe
home
husband
and
wife
had
frowned
at
the
suggestion
of
having
her
with
them
on
the
launch
but
when
they
had
shut
her
in
out
of
sight
and
hearing
and
found
themselves
free
to
follow
their
own
devices
untrammelled
by
their
child
they
did
not
mind
so
much
had
you
better
guthrie
began
when
his
wife
reappeared
clinging
to
the
but
she
exclaimed
again
no
no
let
me
be
outside
with
you
she
wanted
to
feel
at
sea
with
him
to
bathe
herself
under
the
shelter
of
his
protection
in
the
magnificent
tempestuous
inspiring
night
to
her
cooped
up
all
her
life
in
streets
and
prosaic
circumstances
there
was
something
in
the
present
situation
too
poetical
for
words
no
bride
who
had
married
money
and
was
setting
out
by
upon
her
luxurious
european
tour
could
have
been
more
keenly
sensible
of
the
romance
of
foreign
travel
than
she
crossing
hobson
bay
in
a
borrowed
customs
launch
while
the
squally
darkness
surrounding
and
isolating
her
and
her
mate
immeasurably
enhanced
the
charm
i
want
to
see
it
to
feel
it
she
pleaded
the
air
is
so
clean
and
fresh
the
sea
is
so
grand
tonight
how
beautiful
it
smells
guthrie
i
must
have
been
born
for
a
wife
i
love
it
so
of
course
you
were
the
sailor
assented
heartily
no
manner
of
doubt
about
that
well
sit
here
if
you
prefer
it
sweetheart
on
the
stern
grating
only
mind
you
do
catch
cold
and
do
let
us
get
that
pretty
frock
spoiled
before
the
williamstown
folks
have
seen
it
he
steadied
her
while
she
stood
to
have
the
big
macintosh
drawn
closely
about
her
the
round
cape
flapping
far
and
wide
in
the
rough
wind
was
like
an
unmanageable
sail
he
said
and
when
she
was
again
seated
he
tucked
it
about
her
knees
and
feet
buttons
being
hard
to
find
and
fasten
he
pulled
the
two
fronts
of
the
garment
one
over
the
other
across
her
lap
and
she
sat
upon
the
outer
one
then
he
readjusted
the
white
fascinator
winding
the
fluffy
ends
round
her
neck
and
finally
encircling
all
with
his
stalwart
arm
there
she
sat
resting
against
him
her
left
hand
in
his
left
hand
her
contented
eyes
shining
like
stars
in
the
dark
they
were
practically
alone
in
space
their
deck
companions
having
thoughtfully
turned
their
backs
and
made
themselves
as
remote
as
possible
a
long
sigh
fluttered
through
lily
parted
lips
from
her
surcharged
heart
guthrie
heard
it
through
all
the
clamour
of
the
gale
for
it
really
was
a
gale
and
the
noise
of
the
screw
and
fiercely
snorting
funnel
he
stopped
his
face
to
hers
tired
pet
no
she
murmured
oh
no
what
then
only
happy
perfectly
happy
same
here
he
said
careless
how
he
tempted
fate
only
more
so
their
lips
met
and
were
holding
that
sweetest
kiss
of
lovers
that
are
man
and
wife
when
a
wave
driven
by
the
wind
flung
a
shower
of
spray
at
them
giving
each
a
playful
slap
of
the
face
as
a
hint
not
to
be
too
confident
had
you
better
get
inside
he
urged
as
he
wiped
her
cheek
be
rougher
still
directly
oh
no
it
splendid
the
rougher
the
better
i
so
glad
it
rough
i
ca
take
any
harm
so
well
wrapped
up
and
with
you
my
husband
ah
lil
the
hug
he
gave
her
in
acknowledgment
of
the
word
made
her
gasp
for
breath
he
was
so
carried
away
that
he
had
to
use
both
arms
whereby
a
lurch
of
the
boat
nearly
unseated
him
never
he
declared
in
an
intense
whisper
never
shall
you
come
to
harm
my
precious
one
while
you
got
me
to
protect
you
i
can
promise
you
that
dear
she
returned
in
the
same
kind
of
tone
i
know
i
never
shall
and
she
cuddled
closer
up
to
him
and
he
took
a
firmer
grip
of
her
there
was
no
rail
for
either
to
hold
to
and
drawing
out
from
the
shelter
of
the
pier
and
meeting
the
force
of
the
southerly
swell
the
launch
had
begun
to
dance
like
a
cork
on
boiling
water
why
there
quite
a
sea
on
remarked
guthrie
with
a
laugh
i
hope
it
wo
make
you
she
echoed
with
fine
scorn
i
am
a
sailor
wife
sir
bless
your
little
heart
i
been
myself
many
a
time
and
for
not
much
more
than
this
either
however
it
soon
be
over
there
home
waiting
for
us
lil
where
where
she
interrupted
him
with
a
tender
eagerness
the
launch
was
tossed
high
in
the
air
and
the
lights
of
williamstown
stretched
across
the
darkness
in
front
of
them
like
a
band
of
jewels
oh
you
ca
distinguish
it
said
guthrie
but
it
there
it
one
of
those
lights
mrs
hardacre
said
she
was
going
to
keep
the
blind
up
and
the
gas
flaring
so
that
we
might
see
it
as
we
came
over
that
what
i
shall
do
when
you
come
back
next
time
said
the
girl
with
a
voice
like
a
dove
cooing
make
a
beacon
to
guide
you
home
no
fear
that
i
shall
mistake
the
course
little
woman
he
had
an
irresistible
impulse
to
hug
her
with
both
arms
again
and
they
happened
to
be
on
the
verge
of
the
river
current
hardacre
and
finlayson
both
shouted
look
out
sir
but
he
was
not
looking
out
his
sailor
eyes
were
otherwise
occupied
and
so
he
did
not
perceive
the
enemy
of
love
making
the
spring
to
seize
him
just
as
he
was
folding
his
mate
to
his
breast
he
heard
the
warning
cry
and
it
was
then
too
late
to
avert
the
catastrophe
in
the
same
instant
a
sudden
wave
struck
the
launch
and
nearly
turned
her
over
and
the
young
wife
and
husband
holding
to
nothing
but
one
another
and
simply
sitting
upon
an
unprotected
plank
were
tipped
out
as
easily
as
balls
from
a
capsized
basket
oh
this
is
too
absurd
that
was
guthrie
mental
ejaculation
in
the
astonishing
first
moment
a
sailor
who
had
come
through
what
he
had
come
through
to
let
himself
be
caught
unawares
by
such
a
paltry
mischance
as
this
then
what
an
unspeakable
ass
to
have
been
so
careless
to
have
shown
himself
incapable
of
protecting
his
wife
after
all
his
boasts
would
he
ever
hear
the
last
of
it
as
long
as
he
lived
poor
little
woman
how
cold
the
water
felt
when
he
thought
of
her
tender
skin
and
her
pretty
dress
that
she
had
set
such
store
by
in
which
she
had
intended
to
go
to
church
with
him
on
sunday
utterly
destroyed
of
course
well
he
must
make
shift
to
afford
her
another
and
smarter
one
and
get
it
made
quickly
she
should
have
her
pick
and
choice
as
the
following
wave
soused
his
uprising
head
slapping
him
full
in
the
face
so
as
to
confuse
and
blind
him
for
a
second
or
two
the
fear
that
she
might
get
a
dose
of
it
before
they
could
pull
her
out
made
him
sharply
anxious
if
she
got
a
bad
cold
a
shock
to
her
nerves
perhaps
a
serious
illness
he
would
never
forgive
himself
and
what
a
sell
that
would
be
what
waste
of
this
precious
holiday
this
second
honeymoon
so
much
sweeter
than
the
first
after
the
weary
waiting
for
it
he
cleared
his
eyes
and
had
a
momentary
view
of
the
surroundings
before
another
wave
rushed
upon
him
waves
they
were
by
george
he
would
not
have
believed
it
possible
that
such
a
sea
would
be
running
right
up
here
in
this
little
of
a
bay
it
had
seemed
rough
on
the
boat
but
viewed
from
the
surface
it
might
have
been
the
middle
of
atlantic
wastes
they
were
in
the
river
channel
worse
luck
and
the
south
wind
was
dead
on
to
it
bringing
up
the
swell
from
outside
and
the
swell
that
had
set
that
way
for
days
was
so
heavy
as
to
drive
him
back
faster
than
his
powerful
limbs
could
propel
him
in
the
other
direction
at
first
the
launch
seemed
to
want
to
dance
over
him
but
when
he
rose
on
a
swirl
of
water
to
take
his
bearings
after
the
first
bewilderment
she
was
a
couple
of
lengths
away
cutting
the
most
extraordinary
capers
in
her
efforts
to
put
about
her
own
lights
and
those
of
the
beacons
at
the
river
mouth
showed
him
all
her
stern
grating
and
bright
deck
fittings
as
she
heeled
over
hanging
to
the
side
of
one
of
those
ridiculous
ocean
rollers
out
of
bounds
and
he
thought
it
no
wonder
that
he
even
he
had
been
tossed
off
under
the
circumstances
the
crew
who
were
not
sitting
on
a
skimming
dish
as
it
were
had
their
work
cut
out
to
hold
on
as
he
looked
he
measured
his
drift
with
serious
disquietude
although
the
preposterous
idea
of
anybody
being
drowned
had
not
as
yet
occurred
to
him
drowned
here
a
good
joke
indeed
why
they
were
within
hail
of
sandridge
and
ships
or
they
would
have
been
but
for
the
noise
of
wind
and
water
which
smothered
lesser
sounds
and
the
lights
of
williamstown
amongst
them
that
of
the
little
home
awaiting
him
studded
the
shore
on
the
other
hand
near
and
clear
like
the
eyes
of
a
host
of
watching
friends
and
in
hobson
bay
which
could
hardly
cover
the
body
of
a
sunk
yacht
and
right
up
by
the
river
which
had
to
be
dredged
all
the
time
to
keep
it
open
but
where
was
lily
it
scared
him
to
find
himself
out
of
arm
reach
of
her
forced
back
by
the
swell
and
not
to
see
her
immediately
when
he
was
able
to
look
he
saw
the
launch
which
of
course
was
entirely
occupied
in
her
rescue
and
saw
two
white
buoys
floating
and
saw
a
line
thrown
but
nothing
else
except
the
wild
water
that
buffeted
him
and
the
moonless
night
overhead
and
he
remembered
that
the
river
channel
indeed
hobson
bay
in
any
part
was
just
as
dangerous
as
to
one
who
could
not
swim
the
thought
clutched
him
like
a
hand
at
his
throat
got
her
he
yelled
in
a
fury
of
terror
got
her
see
her
he
strained
to
make
himself
heard
by
the
men
on
the
launch
in
a
way
to
burst
his
heart
they
shouted
something
that
he
could
not
understand
and
a
line
came
whizzing
past
him
he
caught
it
as
it
dropped
and
soon
lessened
the
distance
between
them
then
he
perceived
a
long
stretching
out
into
the
darkness
it
went
up
and
down
with
the
toss
of
the
boat
like
the
of
an
impatient
and
a
few
yards
beyond
its
reach
where
it
touched
water
there
was
a
dim
smudge
he
knew
it
for
the
full
cape
of
lily
macintosh
outspread
upon
the
waves
they
alternately
rumpled
and
smoothed
it
flapping
it
into
all
shapes
as
they
tossed
and
toyed
with
it
but
by
the
mercy
of
heaven
it
had
held
her
up
in
the
middle
of
the
mass
he
could
see
her
dear
little
head
hanging
forward
and
downward
just
under
the
surface
out
of
which
a
larger
or
smaller
speck
of
her
white
fascinator
rose
and
gleamed
as
each
roll
swung
her
up
into
the
light
of
the
boat
lamp
turned
upon
the
spot
this
told
him
that
she
was
already
helpless
and
unconscious
although
ten
seconds
had
not
elapsed
since
she
went
over
god
send
that
she
had
not
struck
anything
that
her
heart
was
not
weak
that
she
was
not
subject
to
any
of
the
mysterious
consequences
of
shock
peculiar
to
the
more
than
ordinarily
complex
women
at
any
rate
she
had
not
had
time
to
drown
he
had
seen
a
man
recovered
after
being
under
for
forty
minutes
and
in
less
than
one
they
would
be
taking
her
full
speed
to
williamstown
signalling
for
the
doctor
as
they
went
what
would
the
fellows
ashore
make
of
the
three
whistles
three
times
there
before
they
got
across
they
would
know
the
launch
that
blew
them
and
her
present
errand
and
think
perhaps
that
the
crew
were
on
the
spree
but
no
they
would
have
more
sense
than
that
they
would
look
at
the
wild
night
and
conclude
that
something
had
happened
so
would
the
doctor
who
would
hear
the
summons
from
his
bed
what
would
they
all
say
to
him
guthrie
carey
with
his
good
seaman
record
behind
him
when
he
brought
his
wife
home
in
such
a
state
of
dilapidation
however
all
well
that
ends
well
let
him
only
have
her
safely
there
and
he
would
not
mind
what
anybody
said
and
he
take
precious
good
care
not
to
run
any
risks
with
her
again
as
he
was
and
cramped
in
his
overcoat
he
made
a
violent
bound
towards
the
floating
cape
lunged
twice
caught
it
at
the
second
try
and
pulled
it
eagerly
alas
too
eagerly
he
felt
the
tug
of
lily
weight
only
just
long
enough
to
be
sure
that
she
was
there
and
then
the
fastenings
gave
way
and
she
slipped
through
the
empty
garment
swam
up
to
him
on
the
edge
of
a
new
wave
which
clapped
it
over
his
face
like
a
gigantic
plaster
oh
this
was
dreadful
she
would
be
rescued
eventually
of
course
amongst
them
they
would
not
let
her
drown
not
if
skill
and
courage
had
any
show
at
all
but
the
fact
that
she
was
in
danger
could
no
longer
be
ignored
she
was
a
little
delicate
thing
already
overcome
and
precious
time
was
wasting
when
every
second
was
of
the
most
stupendous
consequence
with
a
frenzied
gesture
guthrie
shook
off
the
cloak
spluttered
spat
and
made
a
dive
to
intercept
her
as
she
went
down
wondering
as
he
did
so
whether
breath
and
strength
would
hold
out
if
he
missed
her
and
had
to
follow
her
to
the
bottom
the
swing
of
the
swell
was
awful
and
the
darkness
of
the
blind
night
too
cruel
for
words
if
only
i
had
this
cursed
coat
off
he
dumbly
sobbed
if
only
i
could
get
rid
of
these
damned
laced
boots
bad
words
would
have
been
forgivable
even
had
he
not
been
a
sailor
he
missed
her
groped
desperately
to
the
verge
of
suffocation
and
came
up
to
cough
and
groan
and
pump
breath
enough
to
take
him
down
again
it
would
have
cost
five
minutes
to
get
his
clothes
off
and
there
was
not
a
single
second
to
spare
now
see
her
he
shrieked
a
sign
bill
hardacre
shouted
but
we
catch
her
when
she
rises
take
a
turn
o
the
line
round
you
sir
so
we
can
haul
you
in
but
there
was
not
even
time
for
that
in
the
frightful
race
of
these
vital
moments
she
was
gone
and
she
must
be
found
and
there
was
but
her
husband
to
look
for
her
the
two
other
men
were
few
enough
for
the
safety
of
the
launch
as
she
was
then
situated
and
besides
hardacre
could
be
more
useful
to
lily
above
water
than
below
the
neighbouring
ships
lay
undisturbed
putting
off
no
boats
to
help
in
all
that
band
of
lights
ringing
the
black
welter
of
the
bay
like
stars
out
of
the
infinite
shining
calmly
upon
an
abandoned
world
not
one
was
moving
guthrie
carey
gave
a
last
look
round
identified
the
window
of
what
was
to
have
been
his
home
where
the
fire
was
burning
brightly
the
little
supper
spread
good
mrs
hardacre
watching
for
them
at
the
door
heard
the
landlady
cousin
wailing
lil
lil
and
again
plunged
under
arms
wide
and
eyes
staring
and
heart
bursting
with
despair
everything
in
him
seemed
bursting
an
agonising
sensation
as
his
overstrained
lungs
collapsed
and
the
power
of
his
strong
limbs
failed
him
then
everything
seemed
to
break
away
and
let
in
the
floods
of
lethe
with
a
rush
confusion
and
forgetfulness
and
a
whirl
of
dreams
settling
to
a
strange
peace
an
irresistible
sleep
as
if
he
had
swallowed
a
magic
opiate
the
sea
took
him
as
a
nurse
takes
a
helpless
child
and
floated
him
up
from
the
place
where
he
had
been
savagely
groping
something
met
him
floating
down
upon
him
and
his
arms
went
round
it
of
their
own
accord
but
they
were
powerless
to
clasp
or
hold
it
it
passed
him
sinking
gently
and
lay
where
it
sank
under
all
the
turmoil
as
still
as
the
rocking
tide
would
let
it
the
launch
sounded
her
steam
whistle
furiously
from
both
sides
of
the
bay
it
was
heard
screeching
through
the
windy
night
like
a
fiend
possessed
and
men
got
up
hastily
to
ask
what
was
the
matter
another
launch
put
out
from
williamstown
and
a
police
boat
from
sandridge
and
the
anchored
ships
awoke
and
hailed
them
soon
boats
were
tossing
about
the
spot
they
tossed
for
two
hours
and
bill
hardacre
dived
seven
times
with
a
rope
round
his
waist
while
the
widowed
young
husband
lay
on
the
cabin
floor
between
two
doctors
the
baby
and
the
landlady
cousin
keening
over
him
well
said
dugald
finlayson
as
at
last
they
headed
for
williamstown
through
the
now
lessening
storm
with
a
bundle
in
tarpaulin
beside
them
it
do
seem
as
if
the
powers
above
take
a
pleasure
in
tripping
us
up
when
we
least
expect
it
aye
said
bill
hardacre
sitting
crying
in
his
wet
clothes
he
said
as
we
were
starting
he
got
all
he
wanted
now
i
thinks
to
myself
at
the
time
thinks
i
an
unlucky
thing
to
say
but
who
is
to
judge
luck
in
this
world
poor
little
lily
harrison
was
a
helpless
creature
and
had
almost
in
her
except
vanity
chapter
ii
sincerely
he
believed
when
he
was
on
his
feet
again
that
his
life
was
wrecked
for
ever
he
did
suffer
from
insomnia
even
with
his
splendid
constitution
for
months
which
proved
the
poignant
insistency
of
his
grief
making
thinking
a
disease
instead
of
a
healthy
function
he
performed
his
duties
mechanically
rigidly
like
an
engine
stoked
from
the
outside
he
no
longer
had
pleasure
or
interest
in
them
the
flavour
was
gone
from
life
it
had
become
a
necessary
burden
to
be
borne
as
best
he
could
at
one
time
he
even
questioned
the
right
of
the
moral
law
to
ask
him
to
bear
it
under
the
circumstances
he
used
to
look
at
the
blue
water
beneath
him
and
long
to
be
beneath
it
sharing
the
fate
of
his
loved
and
lost
he
did
not
want
to
live
without
her
he
wanted
to
die
at
at
he
was
a
man
again
physically
and
mentally
sound
doing
all
reverence
to
the
memory
of
his
dead
wife
a
flawless
angel
in
the
retrospect
while
finding
natural
solace
in
the
company
of
living
women
who
were
also
young
and
fair
the
living
women
were
much
in
evidence
from
the
first
nothing
but
the
sea
could
keep
them
from
trying
to
comfort
him
a
big
fellow
with
a
square
hard
face
and
a
fist
to
fell
an
ox
that
was
just
the
kind
of
man
to
call
for
coddling
apart
from
the
fact
that
he
was
a
widower
had
been
married
for
as
long
as
five
weeks
altogether
with
his
heart
in
his
wife
grave
and
with
that
pathetic
adjunct
a
baby
when
he
would
consent
to
recognise
the
world
of
affairs
again
and
the
claims
of
youth
and
manhood
against
it
he
found
but
of
course
there
is
no
need
to
specify
all
the
things
he
found
one
was
a
batch
of
invitations
awaiting
each
arrival
of
his
ship
in
port
first
two
then
four
then
women
notes
begging
him
to
come
to
as
many
hospitable
houses
for
change
and
rest
and
to
bring
the
baby
he
could
not
bring
the
baby
for
reasons
which
he
did
not
honestly
present
as
a
rule
but
which
he
reluctantly
disclosed
to
alice
urquhart
one
night
at
five
creeks
alice
had
written
one
of
the
six
notes
they
were
six
because
it
was
christmas
time
for
she
was
the
sister
of
jim
urquhart
who
was
the
friend
of
an
down
on
his
luck
through
droughts
and
reduced
to
balancing
ledgers
in
a
melbourne
office
who
was
the
friend
of
one
of
those
doctors
of
williamstown
whose
skill
had
brought
guthrie
carey
to
life
after
he
had
been
drowned
jim
having
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
latter
took
his
sister
to
inspect
the
ship
and
to
have
tea
in
the
mate
cabin
hence
the
return
visit
which
the
captain
who
loved
his
chief
officer
stretched
a
point
to
sanction
there
were
at
five
creeks
station
besides
jim
a
mrs
urquhart
and
several
children
but
alice
the
eldest
of
the
family
was
the
general
manager
of
her
household
ever
struggling
with
her
brother
who
maintained
it
to
lift
it
and
herself
out
of
the
ruts
in
which
her
father
had
left
it
stuck
she
was
close
on
thirty
sad
to
say
and
there
were
three
girls
below
her
and
nothing
happened
from
year
to
year
and
she
was
weary
of
the
monotony
do
come
and
see
us
she
wrote
to
guthrie
carey
one
of
the
men
she
had
ever
known
not
excepting
the
splendid
claud
dalzell
do
come
and
see
us
and
bring
the
baby
country
air
will
do
it
good
and
the
house
is
full
of
nurses
for
it
he
went
himself
out
of
friendship
for
jim
and
after
dinner
sat
in
the
verandah
with
alice
and
explained
why
he
had
not
brought
the
baby
jim
had
then
gone
off
to
doctor
a
sick
horse
and
mrs
urquhart
was
putting
children
to
bed
i
believe
alice
rallied
him
that
you
thought
it
infra
dig
he
protested
earnestly
that
she
was
wrong
no
it
was
not
that
not
that
ignorant
of
the
details
of
the
tragedy
of
his
life
she
scented
a
mystery
about
the
child
was
it
perhaps
not
right
in
its
head
she
wondered
or
afflicted
with
a
hare
lip
son
or
daughter
she
ventured
cautiously
a
boy
said
guthrie
carey
still
with
that
unfatherly
air
of
discontent
sometimes
i
wish
it
was
a
girl
she
could
look
after
me
i
could
have
her
trained
to
be
my
housekeeper
and
sew
my
buttons
on
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
you
would
have
to
wait
a
long
time
said
alice
turning
admiring
eyes
upon
his
comely
person
noting
with
regret
that
he
could
not
be
within
several
years
of
her
own
age
it
is
quite
a
young
infant
is
it
yes
that
is
let
me
see
fifteen
months
and
a
little
over
yes
it
will
be
fifteen
months
on
thursday
since
he
lost
his
mother
time
had
done
so
much
for
him
that
he
could
now
speak
of
her
to
a
stranger
and
he
was
then
only
a
few
weeks
old
poor
poor
little
thing
sighed
alice
urquhart
it
was
by
the
way
a
particularly
sympathetic
night
soft
still
solitary
with
a
full
moon
they
both
felt
it
besides
he
had
had
an
excellent
dinner
five
creeks
was
poor
but
it
lived
well
oh
laughed
the
guest
without
merriment
in
his
laugh
you
waste
pity
on
him
miss
urquhart
he
all
right
rolls
in
fat
never
ailed
a
thing
in
his
life
might
take
the
prize
at
a
baby
show
so
they
tell
me
i
have
not
seen
him
myself
for
a
good
while
what
why
he
in
melbourne
is
he
not
far
out
and
you
have
been
home
to
see
him
i
have
got
a
home
i
gave
it
up
when
you
know
i
knew
i
should
never
be
there
and
you
ca
leave
a
house
and
a
young
child
to
servants
the
little
time
that
i
did
try
to
carry
on
by
myself
i
made
a
dismal
mess
of
it
the
woman
i
trusted
to
he
meant
mrs
hardacre
feeding
it
with
thick
arrowroot
she
have
killed
it
to
a
certainty
indeed
yes
the
idea
but
it
is
incredible
what
some
fools
of
women
can
do
in
the
way
of
mismanaging
a
baby
the
remark
implied
expert
knowledge
on
the
speaker
part
a
mother
of
children
herself
too
said
guthrie
reflectively
and
looking
it
if
ever
a
woman
did
while
a
girl
who
never
had
any
took
to
the
job
like
a
duck
to
water
knew
just
what
to
do
and
how
to
do
it
i
will
say
that
for
her
instinct
miss
urquhart
remarked
to
the
man
in
the
moon
who
seemed
to
survey
the
couple
with
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
i
sure
though
i
say
it
that
i
could
give
many
a
mother
points
myself
i
no
doubt
you
could
i
heard
somebody
say
the
other
day
that
mothers
are
born
not
made
very
true
too
you
see
it
in
the
little
girls
nursing
their
dolls
i
do
think
anything
of
a
that
does
want
a
doll
as
soon
as
it
can
speak
i
always
loved
them
declared
alice
casually
he
leaned
forward
to
look
at
a
spider
web
that
the
silver
light
had
just
touched
making
it
shine
out
from
its
background
of
dark
leaves
and
verandah
post
and
there
was
danger
of
rupture
to
the
delicate
thread
of
the
topic
that
was
weaving
so
charming
a
conversation
wherefore
the
young
lady
hastened
to
inquire
what
had
become
of
his
little
son
i
suppose
she
said
he
is
with
his
mother
people
slowly
resuming
his
attitude
of
repose
the
guest
considered
the
question
not
exactly
with
a
friend
of
his
mother
not
her
family
unfortunately
she
had
no
family
to
speak
of
and
mine
is
in
england
neither
of
us
had
a
soul
here
who
really
belonged
to
us
that
was
just
the
difficulty
it
must
have
been
a
great
difficulty
murmured
alice
in
a
feeling
tone
i
believe
you
assented
guthrie
with
emphasis
in
fact
it
put
me
into
the
most
ridiculous
hole
the
most
confounded
fix
one
that
i
ca
for
the
life
of
me
see
my
way
out
of
one
that
however
i
must
talk
about
it
to
you
it
not
a
thing
that
one
ought
to
talk
about
to
anybody
and
yet
he
yearned
to
talk
about
it
and
now
and
to
this
particularly
sympathetic
woman
who
was
not
young
and
giddy
but
like
himself
experienced
in
the
troubles
of
life
such
as
weighed
him
down
there
was
something
about
her
that
irresistibly
appealed
to
him
and
he
did
not
know
what
but
an
author
who
knows
everything
knows
exactly
what
it
was
it
was
the
moonlight
night
a
few
words
from
her
backed
by
the
nameless
influences
of
the
hour
unloosed
his
tongue
you
must
think
me
an
unnatural
parent
he
said
it
not
that
at
all
i
awfully
fond
of
him
i
got
his
photograph
in
my
pocket
i
show
it
to
you
when
we
go
in
the
last
one
for
the
time
being
i
get
a
new
one
about
every
other
mail
in
all
sorts
of
clothes
and
no
clothes
but
all
as
fat
as
butter
and
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
with
the
joy
of
life
you
never
saw
such
a
fetching
little
cuss
i
give
anything
to
get
hold
of
him
if
i
could
but
surely
his
own
father
no
it
sounds
absurd
to
you
naturally
but
that
because
you
understand
the
situation
i
ca
conceive
of
any
situation
of
course
not
it
a
preposterous
situation
and
i
just
drifted
into
it
i
do
know
how
oh
i
do
know
it
was
for
the
child
own
sake
so
that
you
really
must
call
me
a
heartless
parent
any
more
miss
urquhart
nobody
would
do
that
who
knew
what
i
suffered
for
him
mr
carey
made
a
gesture
and
sighed
deeply
even
in
the
beginning
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
get
out
of
it
having
once
got
in
he
continued
after
a
pause
but
it
has
been
going
on
so
long
getting
worse
and
worse
every
day
and
every
hour
till
now
i
all
tangled
up
like
that
moth
in
that
spider
web
pointing
to
a
little
insect
tragedy
going
on
beside
them
miss
urquhart
leaned
forward
resting
her
arms
on
her
knees
and
spreading
her
hands
in
the
enchanting
moonlight
which
made
them
look
white
as
pearls
and
made
her
rather
worn
face
look
as
if
finely
carved
in
ivory
it
was
a
graceful
thoughtful
confidential
pose
and
her
eyes
uplifted
soft
and
kind
gleamed
just
under
his
eyes
i
so
sorry
she
murmured
but
if
i
do
know
what
the
trouble
is
oh
do
tell
me
if
you
rather
not
i
ca
help
you
can
i
and
i
do
wish
i
could
so
do
i
but
i
afraid
nobody
can
help
me
and
yet
perhaps
a
fresh
eye
a
woman
clearer
insight
he
paused
irresolute
then
succumbed
to
temptation
look
here
miss
urquhart
i
just
tell
you
how
it
is
if
you
promise
not
to
speak
of
it
again
you
are
no
gossip
i
know
how
did
he
know
and
it
will
be
such
a
blessed
relief
to
tell
somebody
and
perhaps
you
could
advise
me
after
all
let
me
try
she
broke
in
encouragingly
for
an
instant
her
pearly
hand
touched
his
sleeve
you
may
trust
me
she
said
i
sure
of
it
i
sure
of
it
he
responded
warmly
he
drew
his
chair
closer
took
a
moment
to
collect
himself
and
plunged
headlong
you
see
she
was
related
to
the
people
my
poor
wife
lived
with
when
we
were
first
married
and
she
was
a
lot
with
her
it
was
lonesome
for
her
with
me
away
at
sea
and
they
got
to
be
sort
of
chums
she
was
with
us
the
night
i
lost
my
poor
girl
i
ca
talk
about
that
now
but
some
day
i
tell
you
and
i
know
she
was
awfully
fond
of
her
that
was
just
the
difficulty
you
are
speaking
queried
alice
gently
of
the
person
who
has
the
baby
exactly
i
see
you
begin
to
understand
i
think
so
said
alice
with
a
smile
broad
enough
to
be
visible
in
moonlight
but
what
was
the
difficulty
well
you
know
being
so
really
fond
of
her
and
all
that
wishing
to
do
it
for
the
sake
of
her
dear
friend
what
could
i
say
especially
as
those
women
were
killing
the
unfortunate
brat
between
them
she
was
not
so
very
young
and
was
evidently
clever
at
managing
yes
interposed
alice
smiling
still
and
peculiarly
situated
for
undertaking
the
job
having
a
good
home
and
only
an
old
mother
who
let
her
do
what
she
liked
and
awfully
set
on
the
baby
from
the
first
and
wanting
an
object
in
life
as
she
said
but
chiefly
it
was
for
lily
sake
to
see
lily
child
messed
about
by
just
anybody
and
killed
with
arrowroot
and
stuff
was
more
than
she
could
stand
to
tell
the
truth
i
could
stand
it
either
and
she
begged
me
to
let
her
have
it
to
look
after
as
there
was
no
female
friend
or
relative
nearer
to
it
than
she
was
what
could
i
do
she
lived
in
a
nice
healthy
spot
and
there
was
the
old
mother
with
her
experience
and
i
was
obliged
to
go
to
sea
and
and
well
i
just
had
to
say
yes
and
be
thankful
to
say
it
we
got
the
the
doctor
found
a
we
engaged
the
sort
of
nurse
that
does
everything
you
know
a
fine
strapping
young
woman
in
the
pink
of
condition
and
and
well
there
it
was
and
at
the
first
blush
the
worst
of
the
trouble
seemed
over
instead
of
just
beginning
i
gave
up
my
house
and
went
off
to
sea
miserable
enough
as
you
may
suppose
but
at
least
with
an
easy
mind
about
the
boy
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
as
far
as
my
poor
lily
was
concerned
i
felt
i
had
acted
for
the
best
indeed
i
do
for
the
life
of
me
understand
how
any
man
could
have
acted
otherwise
under
the
circumstances
the
listener
listening
intently
here
put
a
quiet
question
did
you
pay
her
which
caused
the
narrator
to
wince
like
a
galled
horse
ah
there
you
hit
the
weak
spot
miss
urquhart
right
in
the
he
declared
sighing
furiously
if
i
could
have
paid
her
of
course
there
have
been
no
difficulty
at
all
but
she
would
be
paid
you
ought
to
have
insisted
on
it
said
alice
severely
i
did
insist
i
insisted
all
i
knew
but
she
said
it
was
a
labour
of
love
for
her
friend
and
seemed
so
hurt
at
the
idea
of
money
being
brought
into
the
question
that
i
was
ashamed
to
press
her
beyond
a
certain
point
she
let
me
pay
for
the
nurse
board
and
that
was
all
the
baby
did
eat
anything
you
see
and
they
were
comfortably
off
with
lots
of
spare
room
in
their
house
and
i
just
looked
on
it
as
a
sort
of
temporary
visit
until
i
came
back
until
i
should
be
able
to
turn
round
a
bit
but
with
another
sigh
he
there
yet
miss
urquhart
nodded
with
an
air
of
utter
wisdom
of
course
you
went
to
see
the
child
three
times
whenever
i
was
in
port
and
found
him
always
the
same
so
beautifully
cared
for
that
upon
my
soul
i
never
saw
a
baby
in
my
life
so
sweet
and
clean
and
jolly
as
a
little
sandboy
all
the
time
too
that
means
that
he
had
a
perfect
constitution
inherited
from
you
evidently
and
that
you
were
fortunate
in
the
nurse
very
fortunate
but
it
appeared
that
beyond
beyond
running
the
commissariat
department
so
to
speak
she
did
next
to
nothing
for
him
miss
the
lady
i
spoke
of
did
everything
made
herself
a
perfect
slave
to
him
bought
his
clothes
oh
groaned
the
wretched
man
i
suppose
so
what
did
i
know
about
a
baby
clothes
and
she
would
answer
my
questions
said
he
was
all
right
and
did
want
for
anything
as
i
could
see
with
my
own
eyes
i
tried
making
presents
used
to
bring
her
curios
and
things
found
out
her
birthday
and
sent
her
a
jewel
took
every
chance
i
could
see
to
work
off
the
obligation
but
it
was
no
use
she
gave
me
a
birthday
present
after
i
given
her
one
well
if
moths
will
go
into
spiders
webs
laughed
his
companion
they
must
take
the
consequences
sometimes
they
get
helped
out
he
replied
some
beneficent
godlike
being
puts
out
an
omnipotent
finger
he
looked
at
her
and
she
looked
at
him
at
this
moment
they
seemed
to
have
known
one
another
intimately
for
years
the
moon
again
tell
me
everything
she
said
and
i
help
you
out
so
then
he
told
her
that
he
had
not
this
time
visited
his
son
he
might
have
added
that
he
had
come
to
five
creeks
partly
to
avoid
being
visited
by
him
cowardly
and
weak
he
frankly
confessed
himself
but
the
thing
was
too
confoundedly
awkward
too
embarrassing
altogether
but
she
writes
she
writes
continually
tells
me
what
he
weighs
and
when
he
got
a
fresh
tooth
and
how
he
crawls
about
the
carpet
and
into
her
bed
of
a
morning
and
imitates
the
cat
mewing
and
drinks
i
do
know
how
many
pints
of
new
milk
a
day
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
believe
the
rascal
has
the
appetite
of
a
young
tiger
and
yet
i
ca
pay
for
what
he
eats
the
nurse
was
long
ago
dispensed
with
so
that
i
not
even
her
board
to
send
a
cheque
for
that
they
might
by
chance
make
a
trifle
of
profit
out
of
it
seems
too
late
now
to
simply
take
the
child
away
and
there
leave
it
i
have
the
shabby
courage
to
do
such
a
thing
and
besides
he
might
come
to
any
sort
of
grief
poor
little
chap
in
that
case
there
no
doubt
in
the
world
that
her
taking
of
him
and
doing
for
him
have
been
the
salvation
of
his
health
and
perhaps
his
life
and
i
know
by
what
she
tells
me
that
he
regularly
dotes
on
her
as
so
he
ought
and
would
howl
his
very
head
off
if
i
took
him
from
her
what
could
i
do
with
him
if
i
did
take
him
i
no
home
and
nobody
to
look
after
it
if
i
had
and
hired
servants
are
the
deuce
with
a
lone
man
at
their
mercy
it
would
be
worse
now
than
it
was
at
first
and
so
with
another
heavy
sigh
see
the
situation
i
just
swallowed
up
body
and
bones
drowned
fathoms
deep
in
a
sea
of
debt
and
obligation
that
i
can
never
by
any
possibility
struggle
out
of
except
except
continued
alice
with
the
candid
air
of
a
kind
and
sensible
sister
except
by
marrying
her
you
mean
yes
i
see
the
situation
i
appreciate
your
point
of
view
i
should
understand
it
if
it
were
not
that
she
unquestionably
laid
the
trap
for
you
deliberately
just
as
that
spider
laid
his
for
moths
and
flies
and
marriage
by
capture
has
gone
out
oh
do
say
that
the
man
protested
in
haste
i
would
not
for
a
moment
accuse
her
of
that
she
was
lily
friend
it
was
for
her
it
was
out
of
pure
womanly
compassion
for
the
motherless
child
at
any
rate
in
the
beginning
and
even
now
i
have
no
right
whatever
to
suppose
but
you
know
it
all
the
same
every
word
you
have
said
to
me
tells
me
that
you
know
it
you
may
as
well
be
frank
he
squirmed
a
little
in
his
chair
but
confessed
as
required
well
but
it
a
caddish
thing
to
say
i
think
she
does
expect
it
and
has
she
the
right
to
expect
it
however
that
neither
here
nor
there
the
point
is
that
in
common
honesty
and
manliness
i
should
repay
her
if
i
can
and
there
no
other
way
at
least
i
ca
see
any
other
way
it
is
my
fault
and
not
hers
that
i
do
take
to
the
notion
for
a
better
woman
never
walked
nor
one
that
would
make
a
better
mother
to
the
boy
but
somehow
you
do
like
to
have
your
free
choice
do
you
he
had
come
as
far
as
this
that
he
could
entertain
the
idea
of
choice
which
meant
a
second
choice
it
would
be
utterly
wrong
absolutely
immoral
downright
wicked
to
forego
it
alice
declaimed
with
energy
it
would
be
nothing
short
of
criminal
mr
carey
she
argued
the
point
with
eloquence
even
excitedly
and
when
she
had
brought
him
to
reason
very
willing
to
be
brought
leaned
back
in
her
chair
with
a
joyous
air
oh
we
will
arrange
it
she
reassured
him
there
are
plenty
of
ways
i
tell
you
bending
forward
again
and
gazing
earnestly
into
eyes
from
which
something
that
had
been
looking
out
of
them
seemed
to
have
drawn
back
hastily
you
shall
introduce
me
to
her
and
i
will
bring
him
away
up
here
for
a
visit
he
ought
to
be
in
the
country
in
summer
and
he
will
come
with
me
i
know
and
wo
miss
her
after
a
couple
of
days
i
can
get
you
a
nurse
cheap
from
some
of
the
selectors
and
one
more
or
less
makes
not
the
slightest
difference
in
a
house
like
this
and
i
will
take
care
of
him
for
you
until
you
come
back
next
voyage
or
for
just
as
long
as
you
will
trust
him
to
me
so
the
difficulty
will
solve
itself
without
any
fuss
do
you
see
guthrie
carey
felt
unable
to
reply
he
could
only
murmur
again
and
again
you
are
awfully
good
miss
urquhart
my
word
you
are
too
good
altogether
later
he
declared
more
firmly
that
he
could
not
think
of
troubling
her
nonsense
she
returned
lightly
it
is
all
settled
chapter
iii
decidedly
he
was
a
coward
with
all
his
brawn
and
inches
for
he
dared
not
protest
that
all
was
not
settled
he
certainly
told
himself
that
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
but
he
also
told
himself
that
he
would
be
a
fool
to
do
practically
the
same
thing
that
he
had
done
before
he
passed
a
sleepless
night
poor
fellow
cogitating
the
matter
and
in
the
morning
when
the
moon
was
gone
saw
clearly
himself
where
the
path
of
prudence
lay
still
he
lacked
courage
to
make
it
clear
to
miss
urquhart
even
while
he
saw
her
laying
out
with
enthusiasm
that
road
of
her
own
which
his
terrified
imagination
pictured
her
marching
along
presently
bearing
the
baby
aloft
in
her
arms
and
dragging
him
on
a
behind
her
it
was
not
until
that
he
suddenly
became
a
brave
man
about
five
minutes
after
the
arrival
of
deborah
pennycuick
she
rode
over
from
redford
all
by
herself
as
her
frequent
custom
was
to
see
how
five
creeks
was
getting
on
and
to
talk
over
plans
for
christmas
she
wore
a
brown
holland
habit
over
the
most
beautifully
moulded
form
and
entering
the
house
tossed
aside
a
shady
hat
from
the
most
beautiful
face
that
ever
delighted
eyes
of
man
and
virile
heart
of
it
is
in
such
plain
terms
that
one
must
describe
this
noble
creature
words
in
are
unworthy
of
the
theme
being
introduced
by
alice
urquhart
guthrie
carey
in
a
sense
expanded
on
the
spot
into
a
fresh
stage
a
larger
scope
of
being
with
his
unleaping
recognition
of
her
inspiring
greatness
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
never
looked
upon
a
woman
before
lily
of
course
had
been
an
angel
i
thought
i
should
just
strike
lunch
she
said
as
she
came
like
a
sunbeam
into
the
dim
threadbare
comfortable
room
where
the
meal
was
ready
i
as
hungry
as
a
hunter
mrs
urquhart
the
homely
old
woman
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
and
spread
her
arms
the
visitor
incarnate
dignity
bent
to
the
maternal
caress
with
willing
affection
yet
with
the
tolerant
air
of
that
does
not
run
to
gush
the
children
gathered
round
her
and
hung
upon
her
undeterred
by
the
fact
that
she
had
no
kisses
or
fondlings
for
them
jim
stood
motionless
glowing
at
the
back
of
his
fixed
eyes
when
the
family
had
done
greeting
her
guthrie
was
brought
forward
this
is
mr
carey
deb
who
oh
yes
i
know
and
the
frank
hand
large
strong
and
beautiful
like
every
bit
of
her
went
out
to
him
as
if
she
had
really
known
him
it
is
on
mr
carey
account
that
i
have
come
to
tell
you
that
you
must
bring
him
over
to
redford
at
once
we
were
going
to
said
alice
for
it
was
the
natural
thing
to
take
every
five
creeks
visitor
to
redford
as
soon
as
possible
i
was
writing
to
you
only
this
morning
well
we
just
wanted
to
make
sure
my
father
you
will
excuse
him
for
not
calling
on
you
he
is
not
able
to
get
about
as
he
used
poor
old
man
hears
that
you
belong
to
a
family
at
home
which
was
very
intimate
with
his
family
when
he
was
young
do
you
come
from
norfolk
no
replied
the
sailor
still
in
his
dream
oh
dear
what
a
pity
he
will
be
so
disappointed
we
have
been
hearing
about
the
careys
of
wellwood
all
our
lives
never
were
such
people
apparently
and
when
he
heard
your
name
and
got
the
idea
that
you
were
of
the
clan
nothing
would
do
but
that
you
must
be
fetched
at
once
to
talk
to
him
about
them
are
you
even
a
second
cousin
or
something
my
grandfather
was
born
at
wellwood
ah
that
right
that
all
we
want
that
makes
you
a
carey
of
wellwood
of
course
i
hope
you
know
the
place
i
have
seen
it
but
my
grandfather
was
a
younger
son
and
a
he
was
kicked
out
he
quite
broke
off
never
mind
you
need
go
into
inconvenient
particulars
try
and
remember
all
you
know
that
nice
about
the
hall
and
the
family
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
mary
carey
but
no
she
would
be
before
your
time
of
course
there
was
an
old
mary
carey
she
married
a
spencer
she
was
pointed
out
to
me
last
time
i
was
at
home
the
type
nose
and
chin
together
goodness
keep
that
dark
too
for
mercy
sake
she
is
his
ideal
woman
it
is
for
her
sake
he
wants
you
to
talk
wellwood
with
if
you
spoil
his
pleasure
with
that
hint
of
i
never
forgive
you
i
hope
i
know
better
guthrie
smiled
coming
to
himself
a
little
i
am
sure
you
do
said
she
and
turned
from
him
to
take
her
chair
at
table
then
we
bring
him
tomorrow
alice
said
seating
herself
this
afternoon
said
the
visitor
commandingly
alice
wanted
another
moonlight
talk
about
the
baby
and
knew
the
small
chance
of
getting
it
where
deborah
pennycuick
was
and
she
raised
obstacles
fighting
for
delay
deborah
calmly
turned
to
jim
anything
to
hinder
your
coming
this
afternoon
jim
nothing
said
mr
urquhart
promptly
the
matter
was
evidently
settled
they
sat
down
to
lunch
and
the
talk
was
brisk
it
was
almost
confined
to
the
visitor
and
alice
although
the
former
carefully
avoided
the
shutting
out
of
the
hostess
from
the
conversation
in
which
she
was
incapable
of
taking
a
brilliant
part
jim
in
the
host
place
sat
dumb
and
still
except
for
his
alertness
in
anticipating
his
little
wants
guthrie
carey
on
her
other
hand
was
equally
silent
neither
of
the
two
men
heard
what
she
talked
about
for
listening
to
the
mere
notes
of
her
charming
voice
after
luncheon
she
put
on
her
sensible
straw
hat
you
must
drive
mr
carey
she
said
to
jim
i
just
ride
ahead
and
let
them
know
you
are
coming
let
us
all
go
together
said
alice
i
drive
mr
carey
and
jim
can
escort
you
but
there
was
no
gainsaying
deborah
pennycuick
when
she
had
expressed
her
views
you
have
to
get
ready
she
pointed
out
and
you
do
it
quicker
if
i
not
here
besides
i
ca
wait
they
all
went
out
with
her
to
the
gate
where
her
superb
horse
pawed
the
gravel
and
champed
upon
his
bit
jim
sent
her
springing
to
the
saddle
from
his
horny
palm
like
a
bird
let
out
of
it
and
they
watched
in
silence
while
she
crossed
two
paddocks
leaped
two
sets
of
and
disappeared
as
a
small
dot
of
white
handkerchief
from
the
landscape
what
riding
guthrie
carey
ejaculated
under
his
breath
she
the
best
horsewoman
in
the
country
jim
urquhart
commented
slowly
after
a
still
pause
he
was
a
slow
to
some
people
a
dull
and
heavy
man
who
talked
little
and
less
of
deborah
pennycuick
than
of
any
subject
in
the
world
his
world
and
what
a
howling
beauty
the
sailor
added
in
the
same
whisper
of
awe
again
the
bushman
spoke
muttering
deeply
in
his
beard
she
is
as
good
as
she
is
beautiful
mrs
urquhart
took
her
levelled
hand
from
her
eyes
and
turned
to
contribute
her
testimony
there
mr
carey
goes
the
flower
of
the
western
district
you
find
her
match
amongst
the
best
in
england
i
was
with
her
mother
when
she
was
born
not
a
soul
else
and
put
her
into
her
first
clothes
that
i
helped
to
make
and
a
bonny
one
she
was
even
then
with
her
black
eyes
that
stared
up
at
me
as
much
as
to
say
are
you
i
like
to
know
dear
it
seems
like
yesterday
and
it
nigh
twenty
years
ago
all
poor
sally
pennycuick
girls
are
good
girls
and
the
youngest
is
going
to
be
handsome
too
rose
the
third
is
not
at
all
poor
mary
i
do
know
who
she
takes
after
the
father
was
the
one
with
the
good
looks
but
sally
was
a
fine
woman
too
poor
dear
old
sally
i
wish
she
was
here
to
see
that
girl
mrs
urquhart
and
mrs
pennycuick
plain
brave
working
women
of
the
rough
old
times
wives
of
husbands
incapable
of
companioning
them
as
they
companioned
each
other
had
been
great
friends
on
them
had
devolved
the
drudgery
of
the
pioneer
without
its
romance
they
had
had
year
in
year
out
the
task
of
two
headstrong
and
unthrifty
men
who
neither
owned
their
help
nor
thanked
them
for
it
the
inglorious
of
so
many
obscure
women
and
had
strengthened
each
other
hands
and
hearts
that
had
had
so
little
other
support
pennycuick
she
is
not
living
i
presume
guthrie
enticed
the
garrulous
lady
to
proceed
dear
no
she
died
when
francie
was
a
baby
and
mrs
urquhart
gave
the
details
of
her
friend
last
illness
in
full
deb
was
just
a
little
trot
of
a
thing
her
father
idol
he
would
allow
her
mother
to
correct
her
the
least
bit
though
she
was
a
wilful
puss
with
a
temper
of
her
own
ruled
the
house
she
did
just
as
she
does
now
if
she
had
had
such
a
good
heart
she
have
grown
up
unbearable
there
never
was
a
child
in
this
world
so
spoiled
but
spoiling
good
for
her
she
says
it
to
be
hoped
so
for
spoiling
she
have
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
she
born
to
get
the
best
of
everything
is
debbie
pennycuick
fortunately
her
father
rich
though
not
so
rich
as
he
used
to
be
and
when
she
leaves
her
beautiful
home
it
be
to
go
to
another
as
good
or
better
she
got
to
marry
well
that
girl
never
get
along
as
a
poor
woman
with
her
extravagant
ways
it
never
do
mrs
urquhart
voice
had
subtly
changed
and
something
in
it
made
the
blood
rise
to
the
cheeks
of
the
listeners
it
never
do
to
put
her
into
an
ordinary
where
often
she
could
get
servants
for
love
or
money
because
of
the
dull
life
and
might
have
to
cook
for
station
hands
herself
and
even
do
the
washing
at
a
pinch
jim
wheeled
round
suddenly
and
strode
back
to
the
house
the
house
as
he
was
quite
aware
which
his
mother
alluded
to
she
agitated
by
the
movement
and
without
completing
her
sentence
turned
and
trotted
after
him
alice
was
left
leaning
over
the
gate
at
guthrie
carey
side
you
will
enjoy
this
visit
she
remarked
calmly
ignoring
the
little
scene
redford
is
a
beautiful
place
quite
one
of
the
of
the
district
and
they
do
things
very
well
there
mary
is
ostensibly
the
housekeeper
she
really
does
all
the
hard
work
but
it
is
deb
who
makes
the
house
what
it
is
after
she
came
home
from
school
she
got
her
father
to
build
the
new
part
since
then
they
have
had
much
more
company
than
they
used
to
have
mary
who
had
been
out
for
some
years
did
care
for
gaieties
she
is
a
dear
girl
we
are
all
awfully
fond
of
her
but
she
has
a
most
curious
complexion
quite
bright
red
as
if
her
skin
had
something
the
matter
with
it
although
it
has
of
course
that
goes
against
her
miss
deborah
complexion
is
wonderful
yes
but
oh
deb
is
to
be
compared
with
mary
in
anything
except
looks
she
is
eaten
up
with
vanity
one
ca
be
surprised
and
is
very
dictatorial
and
overbearing
you
could
see
that
at
lunch
but
mary
is
so
gentle
so
unselfish
her
father
right
hand
and
i
do
think
miss
deborah
seemed
because
you
do
know
her
i
do
she
simply
loathes
children
while
mary
would
mother
all
the
orphan
asylums
in
the
world
if
she
could
i
always
tell
her
that
her
mission
in
life
is
to
run
a
creche
or
should
be
lawks
how
she
will
envy
me
when
i
get
that
boy
of
yours
to
look
after
guthrie
feet
seemed
to
take
tight
hold
of
the
ground
really
miss
urquhart
er
i
ca
thank
you
for
your
goodness
in
in
asking
him
up
here
but
i
been
thinking
i
made
up
my
mind
that
the
best
thing
i
can
do
is
to
take
him
home
to
my
own
people
the
idea
was
an
inspiration
of
the
desperate
moment
how
to
put
it
into
practice
he
knew
not
and
she
tried
to
show
him
that
it
was
impracticable
but
he
stuck
to
it
as
to
a
he
would
write
to
his
sister
all
the
he
owned
apparently
and
find
somebody
who
was
going
home
and
is
it
time
to
be
putting
our
things
together
miss
pennycuick
told
us
we
were
to
be
there
for
tea
at
four
if
possible
chapter
iv
behold
him
at
redford
with
his
in
his
hand
he
was
safe
now
from
talk
about
the
baby
but
he
was
also
cut
off
from
the
lovely
deborah
now
wandering
about
her
extensive
grounds
with
another
young
man
old
father
pennycuick
had
him
fast
they
sat
together
under
a
verandah
of
the
great
house
there
were
no
pilots
then
said
the
old
man
puffing
comfortably
at
his
pipe
there
were
no
pilots
then
and
we
had
to
feel
our
way
along
with
the
cast
the
lead
we
got
ashore
at
williamstown
on
backs
and
walked
to
melbourne
crossed
the
yarra
on
a
punt
not
far
from
where
prince
bridge
now
is
yes
said
guthrie
carey
he
seemed
to
be
listening
attentively
his
strong
square
face
set
like
a
mask
but
his
eyes
roamed
here
and
there
bread
the
small
loaf
mr
pennycuick
dribbled
into
his
dreaming
ears
eggs
sixpence
apiece
cheap
enough
too
compared
with
the
gold
prices
but
gold
was
not
thought
of
for
ten
years
after
that
i
tell
you
sir
those
were
the
times
before
the
gold
brought
all
the
in
the
sailor
murmured
something
to
the
effect
that
he
supposed
they
were
we
got
our
club
and
a
couple
of
branch
banks
and
a
and
governor
la
trobe
and
bishop
perry
and
the
nicest
lot
of
fellows
that
ever
came
together
to
make
a
new
country
we
were
as
happy
as
kings
all
young
men
i
was
barely
when
i
took
up
redford
named
after
our
place
at
home
you
know
our
place
at
home
of
course
i
have
seen
it
from
the
road
answered
the
guest
arrested
in
his
mental
wanderings
by
the
mention
of
his
own
age
you
must
have
seen
it
often
living
so
close
i
never
lived
close
myself
i
am
a
londoner
it
all
the
same
your
people
do
the
pennycuicks
and
the
careys
have
been
neighbours
for
generations
i
am
only
distantly
related
to
that
family
a
carey
is
a
carey
persisted
the
old
man
who
had
determined
to
have
it
so
from
the
first
and
he
would
listen
to
no
disclaimers
he
had
already
referred
darkly
to
that
mary
carey
of
the
hooked
nose
and
pointed
chin
his
eldest
daughter
he
said
had
been
named
after
her
this
eldest
daughter
with
her
face
had
shyly
drawn
near
and
taken
a
chair
at
her
father
elbow
where
she
sat
very
quietly
busily
tatting
plain
though
her
face
was
she
had
beautiful
hands
her
play
with
thread
and
shuttle
just
under
guthrie
eyes
held
them
watchful
for
a
time
the
time
during
which
no
sign
of
deborah
white
gown
was
to
be
perceived
upon
the
landscape
my
brother
and
i
we
never
hit
it
off
somehow
so
when
my
father
died
i
cleared
you
do
remember
his
funeral
i
suppose
no
no
that
was
before
your
time
they
hung
the
church
all
over
with
black
broadcloth
of
the
best
that
was
the
way
in
those
days
and
the
cloth
was
the
parson
perquisite
the
funeral
hangings
used
to
keep
him
in
coats
and
trousers
and
they
used
to
deal
out
long
silk
to
all
the
mourners
silk
that
would
stand
alone
as
they
say
and
the
wives
made
mantles
and
aprons
of
them
they
went
down
from
mother
to
daughter
like
the
best
china
and
family
spoons
that
how
women
took
care
of
their
clothes
when
i
was
young
they
did
want
new
frocks
and
fallals
every
week
like
some
folks
i
could
name
and
he
pinched
his
daughter
ear
talk
to
deb
father
said
mary
i
have
not
had
a
new
frock
for
a
great
many
weeks
aye
deb
the
one
that
girl
got
to
marry
a
millionaire
or
i
know
where
she
be
almost
mrs
urquhart
words
and
like
hers
they
pricked
sharply
into
the
feelings
of
our
young
man
his
eyes
went
once
more
to
discover
the
white
gown
afar
off
trailing
unheeded
along
a
dusty
garden
path
the
old
man
saw
it
too
and
his
genial
countenance
clouded
over
well
he
continued
after
a
thoughtful
pause
poor
old
billy
dalzell
and
i
we
emigrated
together
he
had
a
devil
of
a
stepfather
and
no
home
to
speak
of
we
were
mates
at
school
and
we
made
up
our
minds
to
start
out
for
ourselves
you
remember
the
dalzells
of
the
grange
of
course
i
ca
say
that
i
do
sir
well
they
gone
now
billy
father
went
the
pace
and
the
mortgagees
sold
him
up
and
if
his
mother
had
given
him
a
bit
when
we
started
billy
would
have
had
a
penny
she
pawned
all
she
could
lay
her
hands
on
for
him
we
found
out
afterwards
billy
was
cut
up
about
that
and
got
by
heggarty
for
it
when
he
found
it
out
she
was
a
fool
that
woman
everybody
could
see
what
heggarty
was
except
her
old
dalzell
was
a
gentleman
anyhow
with
all
his
faults
the
white
dress
drew
nearer
and
its
grey
tweed
companion
the
host
was
once
more
wasting
his
story
on
deaf
ears
so
we
started
off
and
when
we
got
here
we
went
in
together
he
had
enough
to
buy
a
mob
of
cattle
and
a
dray
and
team
and
so
had
i
we
loaded
up
with
all
the
necessaries
and
hired
three
good
men
and
travelled
till
we
found
country
took
us
about
five
months
at
last
we
came
here
and
put
our
pegs
in
and
i
started
off
to
melbourne
for
the
license
ten
pounds
and
leave
to
renew
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
here
i
stuck
ever
since
billy
he
took
up
other
land
and
got
married
and
died
poor
chap
and
that
his
boy
over
there
pointing
with
his
pipe
and
he
never
be
the
man
his
father
was
if
he
lives
to
a
hundred
the
person
referred
to
was
he
in
the
grey
tweed
who
sauntered
with
such
assurance
at
deborah
side
he
was
a
tall
graceful
and
most
young
fellow
but
guthrie
carey
was
prepared
to
believe
heartily
the
statement
that
dalzell
junior
would
never
be
the
man
his
father
was
you
shall
see
the
identical
hut
mr
pennycuick
kindly
promised
down
by
the
creek
where
those
big
willows
are
i
planted
them
myself
not
good
enough
for
a
my
daughters
say
but
the
best
thing
i
can
wish
for
them
is
that
they
may
be
as
happy
in
their
good
houses
as
i
was
in
that
old
shanty
aye
in
spite
of
many
a
hard
time
i
had
there
with
blacks
and
what
not
we
cut
the
stuff
billy
and
i
and
set
the
whole
thing
up
and
all
our
furniture
was
our
and
a
few
stools
and
a
table
we
washed
in
a
tin
bowl
on
a
block
outside
the
door
not
so
particular
about
tubbing
and
clean
shirts
in
those
days
our
windows
were
holes
of
a
handy
size
for
gun
barrels
and
the
shutters
we
put
up
o
nights
were
squares
of
bark
hung
on
to
nails
by
strips
of
green
hide
many
the
time
i
woke
to
see
one
of
tilted
up
and
a
pair
of
eyes
looking
in
sometimes
friends
sometimes
foes
we
were
ready
for
either
when
billy
went
and
i
thought
i
get
married
too
then
i
built
a
better
house
brick
this
time
and
workmen
from
melbourne
to
do
it
that
it
over
there
now
the
kitchens
and
and
imported
furniture
er
i
am
not
boring
you
i
hope
oh
dear
no
i
am
deeply
interested
well
billy
and
i
the
tale
seemed
interminable
billy
and
i
we
gave
sixty
pounds
apiece
for
our
stock
horses
and
the
same
for
a
ton
of
flour
and
went
right
over
ballarat
without
knowing
it
camped
there
sir
and
did
see
the
gold
we
must
actually
have
crunched
under
our
boot
heels
and
billy
had
misfortunes
and
died
poor
as
a
rat
it
was
in
the
family
mrs
was
all
right
though
she
used
to
send
a
brother
of
hers
to
melbourne
market
with
her
cattle
and
cash
being
scarce
he
would
sometimes
have
to
take
land
deeds
for
them
and
she
be
wild
with
him
for
it
but
what
was
the
consequence
those
bits
of
paper
that
she
thought
so
worthless
that
it
a
wonder
she
took
the
trouble
to
save
them
gave
her
city
lots
that
turned
out
as
good
as
gold
mines
she
sold
too
soon
or
she
have
made
millions
and
died
of
a
broken
heart
they
say
when
she
found
out
that
mistake
still
she
left
a
lot
more
than
it
good
for
a
young
fellow
to
start
life
with
that
boy
has
been
to
cambridge
and
now
he
loafs
about
the
club
pretends
to
be
a
judge
of
wine
gets
every
stitch
of
clothes
from
london
pah
mr
pennycuick
spat
neatly
and
with
precision
over
the
verandah
floor
into
a
but
these
mother
darlings
you
know
them
if
mrs
dalzell
could
see
him
now
i
daresay
she
be
bursting
with
pride
for
there
no
denying
that
he
a
chap
but
his
father
would
be
ashamed
of
him
daddy
dear
mary
gently
expostulated
so
he
would
an
idle
finicking
scamp
that
never
do
an
honest
stroke
of
work
as
long
as
he
lives
and
i
wish
deb
would
waste
her
time
listening
to
his
nonsense
is
it
about
time
to
be
getting
ready
for
dinner
moll
mary
looked
through
a
window
at
a
clock
indoors
and
said
it
was
guthrie
hailed
the
news
and
rose
to
his
feet
but
not
yet
did
he
escape
his
host
hoisting
himself
heavily
out
of
his
big
cane
chair
hollowed
like
a
basin
under
his
vast
weight
extended
a
detaining
hand
come
with
me
to
my
office
a
minute
he
half
whispered
i
like
to
show
you
something
with
apparent
alertness
but
sighing
inwardly
guthrie
followed
his
host
to
the
room
in
the
old
part
of
the
house
which
he
called
his
office
mr
pennycuick
carefully
shut
the
door
opened
a
desk
full
of
drawers
and
and
brought
forth
a
bit
of
cardboard
with
a
shy
air
he
had
never
shown
it
to
his
family
and
doubtless
would
not
have
shown
it
now
if
he
had
not
been
growing
old
and
soft
and
sentimental
it
was
a
prim
and
niggling
little
drawing
of
english
redford
a
flat
facade
with
swallows
as
big
as
condors
flying
over
the
roofs
and
dogs
that
could
never
have
got
through
any
doorway
gambolling
on
the
lawn
in
front
a
tiny
carey
in
one
corner
was
just
and
only
just
visible
to
the
naked
eye
this
was
done
for
me
when
we
were
both
young
by
her
your
aunt
said
mr
pennycuick
gloating
upon
his
treasure
over
guthrie
shoulder
not
my
aunt
explained
guthrie
i
do
know
what
relation
but
a
long
way
farther
off
than
that
i
am
only
a
very
small
carey
you
know
sir
mr
pennycuick
testily
intimated
as
before
that
to
be
a
carey
at
all
was
enough
for
him
it
was
his
excuse
for
these
confidences
of
which
he
was
half
ashamed
while
guthrie
studied
the
poor
picture
trying
to
look
as
interested
as
he
was
expected
to
be
his
host
turned
and
stared
down
into
the
drawer
that
had
held
it
for
so
many
years
other
things
were
there
the
usual
dead
flowers
still
holding
together
still
fusty
to
the
nose
the
usual
yellowing
ball
glove
the
usual
dance
and
invitation
cards
and
faded
letters
with
their
edges
frayed
a
with
an
embroidered
mixed
up
with
in
coloured
silks
upon
perforated
card
backed
by
a
still
gleaming
red
satin
ribbon
looped
at
one
end
and
fringed
out
at
the
other
the
book
that
it
was
tucked
into
the
language
of
flowers
a
large
valentine
in
a
wrapper
with
many
broken
seals
some
newspaper
cuttings
half
a
sixpence
with
a
hole
in
it
and
a
daguerreotype
in
a
leather
case
this
last
he
took
up
opened
and
gazed
at
steadily
until
his
companion
was
compelled
to
interrupt
him
with
an
inquiring
eye
then
he
passed
it
over
and
guthrie
turned
it
this
way
and
that
until
he
caught
the
outlines
of
a
long
aquiline
face
between
bunched
ringlets
and
a
long
bodice
with
a
deep
point
which
he
understood
to
have
belonged
to
his
distant
relative
at
some
period
before
he
was
born
and
this
he
murmured
politely
yes
said
mr
pennycuick
that
her
and
i
never
shown
it
to
a
soul
before
not
even
to
my
wife
a
a
sweet
expression
fair
was
she
fair
as
a
lily
and
as
pure
and
as
beautiful
gentle
as
a
dove
with
blue
eyes
guthrie
did
not
care
for
this
type
just
now
he
liked
them
dark
and
flashing
and
spirited
like
miss
deborah
but
he
murmured
sympathetically
the
loveliest
woman
in
england
the
old
man
maundered
on
surely
you
must
have
heard
of
her
in
the
family
guthrie
had
not
only
heard
of
her
as
we
know
he
had
seen
her
but
he
shook
a
denying
head
and
dropped
another
hint
of
his
own
position
in
the
family
outside
the
royal
enclosure
as
it
were
well
now
i
just
tell
you
what
happened
said
mr
pennycuick
turning
to
the
open
drawer
again
strictly
between
ourselves
of
course
and
only
because
you
are
a
carey
you
understand
somehow
you
bring
it
all
back
he
was
fumbling
with
the
big
valentine
getting
it
out
of
its
case
yes
guthrie
encouraged
him
while
inwardly
chafing
to
be
gone
you
see
this
it
was
an
exquisite
structure
of
foamy
paper
lace
silver
doves
cupids
transfixed
hearts
and
wreaths
of
flowers
miraculously
delicate
how
it
had
kept
its
frail
form
intact
for
the
many
years
of
its
age
was
a
wonder
to
behold
you
see
this
said
the
old
man
well
when
i
was
a
young
fellow
the
of
february
was
a
time
i
can
tell
you
you
fellows
nowadays
you
know
what
fun
is
nor
how
to
go
nor
anything
i
was
at
old
redford
that
year
and
she
was
at
wellwood
and
all
through
the
sleet
and
snow
i
rode
there
after
dark
tied
my
horse
to
a
tree
crept
up
that
you
know
it
and
round
by
the
east
terrace
to
the
porch
and
laid
my
valentine
on
the
and
clanged
the
bell
and
hid
behind
the
till
the
man
came
out
to
get
it
then
i
went
home
and
last
thing
at
night
there
was
a
at
the
door
at
redford
and
i
dashed
out
to
catch
whoever
it
was
her
brother
she
sent
but
was
quite
smart
enough
if
only
i
seen
him
i
should
have
known
as
i
ought
to
have
without
that
but
i
did
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
she
send
the
answer
so
soon
and
she
had
disguised
her
writing
in
the
address
and
there
was
another
girl
name
of
myrtle
vining
who
used
to
have
myrtle
on
her
and
all
over
the
place
and
here
these
flowers
looked
to
me
as
if
they
were
meant
for
myrtle
and
these
two
crossed
arrows
are
like
capital
v
and
how
i
came
to
be
such
an
egregious
dolt
lord
only
knows
well
paid
for
it
that
i
have
i
paid
for
it
look
here
do
touch
i
show
you
what
i
found
out
when
it
was
too
late
after
she
played
shy
with
me
till
i
got
angry
and
left
her
and
it
was
all
over
my
eyes
are
good
enough
to
see
it
now
but
i
suppose
it
there
still
with
infinite
care
and
the
small
blade
of
his
he
lifted
the
tiny
tip
of
a
tiny
cupid
wing
with
bent
head
and
puckered
eyelids
guthrie
peered
under
and
read
yours
written
on
a
space
of
paper
hardly
larger
than
a
pin
head
in
my
valentine
that
night
said
mr
pennycuick
i
asked
her
to
have
me
i
did
hide
it
up
in
this
way
i
knew
while
i
wondered
that
she
took
no
notice
that
she
must
have
seen
it
this
was
her
answer
and
i
never
got
it
sir
till
she
was
married
to
another
man
and
then
by
the
merest
accident
then
i
could
even
have
the
satisfaction
of
telling
her
that
i
got
it
and
how
it
was
i
had
got
it
before
of
course
i
was
going
to
upset
her
after
she
was
married
to
another
man
i
had
to
let
her
think
what
she
liked
of
me
guthrie
was
certainly
interested
now
but
not
as
interested
as
he
would
have
been
the
day
before
the
day
before
this
story
would
have
moved
him
to
pour
out
the
tale
of
his
own
untimely
and
irreparable
loss
he
and
old
mr
pennycuick
would
metaphorically
speaking
have
mingled
their
tears
together
you
forget
off
and
on
said
mr
pennycuick
as
he
wrapped
up
his
treasure
with
shaking
hands
and
excessive
care
perhaps
for
years
at
a
time
while
you
are
at
work
and
full
of
affairs
but
it
comes
back
especially
when
you
are
old
and
lonely
and
you
think
how
different
your
life
might
have
been
you
do
know
anything
about
these
things
yet
perhaps
when
you
are
an
old
man
like
me
you
will
guthrie
did
know
no
one
better
he
believed
but
he
did
not
say
unknown
to
himself
he
had
reached
that
stage
which
mr
pennycuick
came
to
when
he
began
courting
sally
dimsdale
who
had
made
him
such
a
good
and
faithful
and
uninteresting
wife
it
is
better
to
have
loved
and
lost
than
never
to
have
loved
at
all
says
the
old
proverb
true
enough
but
one
might
write
it
this
way
with
even
more
truth
it
is
better
to
love
and
lose
than
to
love
and
gain
one
means
by
love
romantic
love
of
course
chapter
dinner
was
over
they
had
all
gone
up
to
the
big
which
was
the
feature
of
the
part
the
third
house
of
the
series
which
now
made
one
the
new
part
was
incongruously
solid
and
modern
with
a
storey
comprising
the
and
its
staircase
only
which
overtopped
the
adjacent
roofs
below
it
was
a
corresponding
and
both
apartments
were
furnished
richly
in
the
fashion
of
the
time
tons
of
solid
mahogany
in
the
latter
and
a
pasture
of
carpet
and
brocade
upholsterings
in
the
former
lit
up
with
gilded
and
as
by
rays
of
a
pale
sun
curly
rosewood
sofas
and
and
marbled
and
mirrored
chiffonniers
and
the
like
were
in
such
profusion
upstairs
as
to
do
away
with
the
air
of
bleakness
common
to
a
chamber
of
large
size
and
arrangement
a
fine
grand
piano
stood
open
in
a
prominent
place
four
large
shaded
lamps
and
four
piano
candles
pleasantly
irradiated
the
whole
while
three
french
windows
opening
on
a
balcony
still
stood
wide
to
the
summer
night
by
the
great
white
marble
mantelpiece
under
the
great
filling
the
huge
chair
specially
dedicated
to
his
use
father
pennycuick
sat
in
comfortable
gossip
with
his
old
friend
thornycroft
of
bundaboo
it
irked
him
to
separate
himself
from
pipe
and
newspaper
baggy
coat
and
slouchy
slippers
and
his
corpulent
frame
objected
to
stairs
but
when
he
had
guests
he
considered
it
his
duty
to
toil
up
after
them
in
patent
shoes
and
dining
costume
and
sit
amongst
them
until
music
or
card
games
were
on
the
way
when
he
would
retire
as
unobtrusively
as
his
size
and
heavy
footstep
permitted
it
was
the
custom
to
pretend
not
to
see
or
hear
him
go
and
it
would
have
annoyed
him
exceedingly
had
anyone
bidden
him
the
pair
talked
shop
after
the
manner
of
old
squatters
when
they
sit
apart
but
the
tall
spare
grey
man
with
the
thoughtful
face
more
like
a
soldier
than
a
was
not
thinking
much
of
his
flocks
and
herds
his
thoughts
followed
the
direction
of
his
quiet
eyes
focussed
upon
an
amber
silk
gown
and
its
immediate
surroundings
mr
thornycroft
was
deborah
godfather
and
at
was
to
all
the
sisters
quite
an
elderly
man
a
sort
of
bachelor
uncle
to
the
family
one
with
no
concern
in
such
youthful
pastimes
as
and
marrying
except
as
a
benevolent
onlooker
and
and
so
the
veiled
vigilance
of
his
regard
was
not
noticed
as
it
would
not
have
been
understood
by
anybody
but
other
eyes
similarly
occupied
were
plainer
to
read
jim
urquhart
of
course
jim
as
ineligible
for
the
most
coveted
post
in
the
western
district
as
he
well
could
be
by
reason
of
the
family
already
depending
upon
him
together
with
the
load
of
debt
left
along
with
it
by
his
deceased
father
a
pal
of
mr
pennycuick
in
the
gay
and
good
old
times
still
contrived
to
bring
himself
within
the
radius
of
deborah
observation
whenever
occasion
served
and
being
there
although
silent
and
keeping
to
the
background
his
gaze
followed
her
as
the
gaze
of
an
opossum
follows
a
light
on
a
dark
night
with
the
same
still
absorption
nothing
but
her
returning
gaze
could
divert
it
from
its
mark
it
was
so
natural
so
calmly
customary
so
unobtrusive
that
nobody
cared
to
attach
importance
to
it
he
sat
now
far
back
against
the
green
brocade
hangings
of
a
corner
window
where
he
could
see
the
beloved
profile
in
the
middle
of
the
room
his
big
hands
clasped
his
big
bony
knees
and
his
long
loose
body
hung
forward
out
of
the
little
chair
that
was
never
built
for
such
as
he
and
he
seemed
given
over
to
rose
pennycuick
tale
of
the
pony
that
had
corns
and
the
cat
that
had
been
mangled
in
a
cruel
rabbit
trap
he
gave
her
wise
counsel
regarding
the
treatment
of
these
poor
things
his
deep
drawling
voice
an
unnoticed
instrument
in
the
orchestra
of
tongues
but
his
sunburnt
face
held
itself
steadily
in
the
one
direction
from
the
day
that
he
came
to
manhood
his
soul
had
kept
the
same
attitude
towards
the
woman
to
whom
the
profile
belonged
but
he
never
alluded
to
the
fact
save
in
this
silent
way
then
there
was
the
reverend
bennet
goldsworthy
church
of
england
minister
as
his
style
and
title
ran
privately
mr
pennycuick
did
not
like
him
but
for
the
sake
of
the
priestly
office
and
as
being
a
parishioner
he
gave
him
the
freedom
of
the
house
and
much
besides
the
parson
buggy
never
went
empty
away
redford
hams
vegetables
poultry
butter
and
eggs
kept
his
larder
supplied
his
was
derived
therefrom
also
his
horse
also
his
cow
when
his
cow
began
to
fail
he
promptly
mentioned
the
fact
he
was
mentioning
it
now
to
mary
pennycuick
yes
he
was
saying
a
propos
of
his
motherless
little
girl
whom
he
often
brought
to
redford
for
change
of
air
leaving
her
to
the
care
of
the
sisters
until
convenient
to
him
to
reclaim
her
yes
it
will
mean
much
to
my
child
in
after
life
to
have
had
the
refining
influences
of
this
house
at
the
most
impressionable
age
truth
was
that
ruby
was
growing
a
little
old
for
her
kindergarten
and
he
wanted
redford
to
offer
her
gratis
of
course
a
share
in
francie
governess
i
could
not
endure
to
see
her
grow
up
like
the
daughters
of
so
many
of
my
brother
clergy
ignorant
of
the
very
rudiments
of
decent
life
meaning
not
decent
life
in
the
ordinary
acceptation
of
the
term
but
the
life
that
included
evening
dress
and
she
has
caught
the
colonial
accent
already
at
that
horrid
school
is
the
new
keeow
coming
says
she
and
by
the
way
that
reminds
me
your
good
father
promised
me
the
cow
a
fortnight
ago
the
one
we
have
gives
us
hardly
enough
milk
for
the
table
we
have
had
no
butter
from
her
for
months
i
am
so
sorry
grieved
mary
as
if
redford
had
failed
in
its
sacred
duty
of
hospitality
i
will
tell
him
about
it
the
men
have
all
been
so
busy
with
the
shearing
she
was
also
distressed
that
she
could
not
definitely
invite
ruby
for
the
impending
holidays
but
deb
had
issued
her
commands
that
redford
was
not
to
be
saddled
with
a
nurseless
child
at
christmas
when
everybody
hands
would
be
full
mary
was
ruby
willing
when
redford
had
her
in
charge
she
was
also
the
kindest
hostess
of
them
all
to
ruby
father
to
her
was
left
the
task
of
entertaining
him
and
she
never
neglected
it
naturally
he
gave
her
no
thanks
when
he
said
that
what
ruby
needed
was
a
mother
tender
care
it
was
at
deborah
he
looked
who
never
turned
a
in
his
direction
at
any
time
except
when
good
manners
obliged
her
and
who
was
not
tender
to
ruby
whom
she
called
that
brat
and
had
smartly
spanked
on
several
occasions
a
beautiful
woman
can
not
help
having
objectionable
lovers
any
more
than
a
king
can
help
a
cat
looking
at
him
this
man
a
most
useful
little
underbred
person
typical
of
so
large
a
class
in
the
colonial
church
was
deb
pet
aversion
and
did
not
know
it
he
was
not
made
to
see
his
own
deficiencies
as
she
saw
them
when
first
she
flashed
upon
his
dazzled
vision
splendid
in
a
scarlet
dinner
gown
and
carrying
her
regal
head
as
if
the
earth
belonged
to
her
he
really
saw
no
reason
why
he
with
his
qualifications
of
comparative
youth
good
looks
his
sort
of
good
looks
and
notorious
pulpit
eloquence
should
not
aspire
to
rush
in
where
so
many
feared
to
tread
his
rush
had
been
checked
at
the
outset
but
he
was
still
unaware
of
the
nature
of
the
barrier
that
deb
held
rigid
between
them
he
continued
to
gaze
at
her
with
his
ardent
little
black
eyes
as
if
no
barrier
were
there
and
it
was
because
he
did
so
that
deb
who
could
not
slap
him
for
it
slapped
ruby
sometimes
and
called
her
a
brat
and
would
not
have
her
asked
to
redford
for
the
holidays
thereby
giving
occasion
to
envious
alice
urquhart
for
that
warning
to
guthrie
carey
not
to
trust
his
baby
to
her
there
was
still
another
lover
present
the
favoured
lover
he
sat
with
alice
near
the
piano
where
francie
and
her
governess
were
playing
duets
listening
without
listening
to
his
companion
jerky
talk
those
pathetic
attempts
to
attract
him
which
so
many
girls
were
not
too
proud
to
make
obvious
to
his
keen
apprehension
claud
distinction
was
that
he
was
the
most
polished
young
man
of
his
social
circle
he
had
had
all
the
advantages
that
money
could
give
and
in
addition
was
naturally
refined
and
handsome
to
hear
claud
dalzell
read
poetry
or
sing
german
to
his
own
graceful
accompaniment
was
to
make
a
poet
of
the
listener
to
dance
with
him
was
pure
enchantment
to
another
good
dancer
he
was
the
best
horseman
in
the
land
and
if
his
present
host
could
not
appreciate
his
many
charms
except
perhaps
the
last
named
others
did
the
whole
race
of
girls
more
or
less
fell
down
and
worshipped
him
he
sat
with
alice
urquhart
because
he
could
not
sit
with
deborah
or
rather
because
he
would
not
condescend
to
share
her
with
that
mate
of
a
tramp
cargo
boat
as
he
styled
guthrie
carey
whom
she
had
made
happy
at
last
she
had
rescued
him
from
her
father
clutches
she
had
called
him
to
a
chair
beside
her
where
there
was
no
room
for
a
third
chair
her
glistening
skirt
flowed
over
his
modest
toes
her
firm
round
arm
flung
along
the
chair
arm
between
them
made
him
feel
like
peter
ibbotson
before
the
venus
of
milo
it
was
so
perfect
a
piece
of
human
sculpture
she
lay
back
slowly
fanning
herself
and
smiling
her
eyes
wandering
all
the
time
in
neighbourhood
without
actually
touching
him
a
tall
dignified
as
well
as
beautiful
young
woman
knowing
herself
to
be
such
and
unspoiled
by
the
knowledge
she
wore
her
crown
with
the
air
of
feeling
herself
entitled
to
it
but
it
was
an
unconscious
air
without
a
trace
of
petty
vanity
behind
it
everything
about
her
was
large
and
generous
and
incorruptibly
wholesome
even
her
undoubted
high
temper
and
this
was
her
charm
to
every
man
who
knew
her
not
less
than
her
lovely
face
guthrie
carey
and
who
shall
blame
him
basked
in
his
good
luck
but
every
now
and
then
he
looked
up
and
met
the
glower
of
claud
dalzell
with
a
steely
eye
these
two
men
each
so
fine
of
his
kind
met
with
the
sentiments
of
rival
stags
in
the
mating
season
the
impulse
to
fight
sight
and
assure
the
of
the
unfittest
came
just
as
naturally
to
them
as
to
the
less
civilised
animals
each
recognised
in
the
other
not
merely
a
personal
rival
but
an
opposing
type
it
amused
deborah
who
grasped
the
situation
as
surely
as
they
did
to
note
the
bristling
antipathy
behind
the
careful
politeness
of
their
mutual
regard
if
it
did
not
bristle
under
her
immediate
eye
it
crawled
look
out
for
the
articles
of
virtue
claud
had
warned
her
earlier
in
the
evening
that
big
sailor
of
yours
is
rather
like
a
bull
in
a
china
shop
he
nearly
had
the
carved
table
over
just
now
he
does
know
just
how
to
judge
distance
in
relation
to
his
bulk
i
like
to
know
his
fighting
weight
when
he
plants
his
hoof
you
can
feel
the
floor
shake
he
is
a
fine
figure
of
a
man
deb
commented
with
a
smile
i
ca
yawned
mr
dalzell
casually
stand
a
person
who
eats
curry
with
a
knife
and
fork
it
was
pretty
tough
that
curry
i
expect
he
could
get
it
to
pieces
with
a
spoon
he
did
not
try
to
i
never
noticed
i
should
remember
to
notice
a
little
trifle
like
that
my
dear
girl
it
is
the
little
trifle
that
marks
the
man
oh
said
deb
and
then
she
sought
guthrie
carey
and
brought
him
to
sit
beside
her
that
gentleman
sings
well
remarked
guthrie
tepidly
at
the
conclusion
of
a
finely
rendered
song
i
often
wish
i
could
do
those
ornamental
things
unfortunately
a
man
who
has
his
work
if
he
sticks
to
it
properly
gets
no
time
to
qualify
i
afraid
i
shall
never
shine
at
tricks
tell
me
about
your
work
said
clever
deb
smiling
behind
her
waving
fan
at
once
she
had
him
quite
happy
talking
about
himself
no
effort
was
necessary
to
draw
him
out
that
she
deigned
to
listen
to
him
was
enough
his
struggles
as
boy
boy
his
tough
battle
for
the
first
certificate
his
complicated
trials
as
second
mate
holding
theoretically
an
authority
that
was
practically
none
his
rise
to
be
qualified
master
and
actual
mate
no
position
in
his
eyes
evidently
his
anticipation
of
the
master
extra
and
the
pass
in
steam
which
might
lead
to
anything
the
whole
tale
was
told
her
in
terse
straightforward
fashion
but
with
an
art
new
to
the
modest
who
hated
brag
as
much
as
cowardice
he
bragged
in
in
challenge
of
the
formidable
equipment
of
his
rival
and
how
interested
she
was
how
well
she
understood
his
case
that
it
was
better
than
the
swellest
to
make
your
own
way
by
your
own
exertions
and
splendid
to
have
done
so
much
while
still
on
the
right
side
of
thirty
so
much
he
had
done
more
than
that
he
had
been
a
husband
and
father
at
but
this
his
most
distinguished
exploit
was
not
mentioned
chapter
vi
he
mentioned
it
next
day
however
he
had
to
for
after
breakfast
a
letter
forwarded
from
five
creeks
reached
him
from
the
caretaker
the
lady
of
whom
he
stood
in
such
undignified
dread
the
sight
of
her
handwriting
paled
his
brown
face
and
set
his
stout
heart
fluttering
what
did
she
want
of
him
he
kept
the
letter
unopened
for
some
time
because
he
was
afraid
to
know
although
convinced
beforehand
that
he
did
know
that
of
course
it
was
the
visit
he
should
have
paid
before
coming
up
country
when
at
last
he
drew
the
sheet
from
its
envelope
as
if
it
had
come
from
an
infected
house
and
had
not
been
fumigated
and
cast
a
hurried
glance
over
the
contents
he
found
that
the
unexpected
had
happened
once
more
the
wildly
unexpected
she
was
going
to
be
married
he
was
a
general
merchant
in
prosperous
business
and
there
was
nothing
to
wait
for
except
mr
instructions
as
to
what
was
to
be
done
with
the
dear
little
boy
she
would
feel
acutely
the
parting
from
him
after
he
had
been
from
his
birth
like
a
child
of
her
own
but
mr
carey
would
understand
that
she
could
not
now
continue
her
labour
of
love
on
his
behalf
that
she
had
others
to
consider
but
she
knew
of
a
most
excellent
substitute
a
dear
friend
of
her
own
who
had
long
taken
the
deepest
interest
in
darling
harry
and
with
whom
she
was
sure
he
would
be
as
safe
and
happy
as
with
herself
she
had
expected
to
see
mr
carey
when
he
arrived
to
arrange
matters
she
hoped
he
would
come
as
soon
as
possible
in
the
bewilderment
of
his
mingled
elation
and
anxieties
the
young
father
did
not
know
what
to
do
for
the
moment
while
recognising
the
urgent
need
for
action
he
must
go
as
soon
as
possible
of
course
but
he
could
not
depart
suddenly
without
a
reason
and
to
give
the
reason
would
be
to
give
himself
away
to
alice
urquhart
besides
a
outing
had
been
planned
on
purpose
for
him
the
possibilities
in
connection
with
it
were
enormous
and
five
days
of
his
leave
were
unexpended
still
he
must
think
it
over
he
must
have
advice
so
as
a
first
instalment
of
duty
he
scrawled
a
recklessly
affectionate
letter
full
of
gratitude
to
her
who
had
been
his
good
genius
and
the
guardian
angel
of
his
boy
he
did
not
disguise
his
envy
of
the
general
merchant
whose
vows
of
love
could
not
have
excelled
in
fervent
expression
the
good
wishes
of
the
writer
for
the
happiness
of
the
betrothed
pair
he
hoped
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
his
dear
old
friend
on
the
following
day
or
the
day
after
that
at
latest
and
he
promised
himself
the
satisfaction
of
squandering
his
saved
pay
on
such
a
wedding
present
as
would
at
least
cover
the
cost
of
the
bread
and
milk
the
boy
had
devoured
at
her
expense
guthrie
dropped
his
letter
in
the
while
they
were
calling
to
him
that
it
was
time
to
start
and
he
turned
the
key
of
silence
upon
his
secret
until
he
could
pour
it
into
the
right
ear
it
was
a
wonder
he
did
not
pour
it
into
mary
for
she
drove
him
to
bundaboo
and
nobody
could
have
been
more
sympathetic
than
she
she
was
the
virtual
mother
of
the
family
who
loved
children
and
she
was
not
she
could
not
be
a
a
sensible
man
in
domestic
difficulties
could
not
have
sought
a
wiser
confidante
yet
he
resisted
stubbornly
all
her
gentle
invitations
to
confide
in
the
first
place
he
did
not
want
to
go
with
her
in
the
while
deb
and
dalzell
rode
he
did
not
like
to
see
it
taken
for
granted
as
it
seemed
to
be
by
all
that
a
sailor
on
horseback
must
necessarily
make
a
fool
of
himself
the
slight
to
his
was
enough
to
dull
the
edge
of
his
joy
in
the
general
merchant
proceedings
for
as
the
reader
will
remember
he
was
still
but
he
had
to
weigh
down
the
springs
of
a
little
basket
thing
no
better
than
an
invalid
and
see
the
young
exquisite
whom
he
could
have
tossed
over
his
shoulder
with
one
hand
show
off
feats
of
fancy
horsemanship
to
make
deb
dark
eyes
kindle
mr
pennycuick
had
carelessly
asked
billy
degenerate
son
to
school
a
bit
a
creature
which
for
weeks
had
not
allowed
a
man
upon
his
back
and
had
had
no
exercise
beyond
his
voluntary
scamperings
about
the
paddock
from
which
he
had
been
brought
dancing
with
excitement
and
indignation
all
the
stablemen
had
been
required
to
get
his
bridle
and
saddle
on
he
now
wheeled
round
and
round
in
the
large
space
left
for
him
while
claud
dalzell
in
his
london
riding
clothes
and
with
his
air
of
a
reigning
prince
warily
turned
with
him
guthrie
carey
in
the
waiting
had
but
one
interest
in
the
performance
his
hopeful
anticipation
of
a
fatal
or
at
least
a
ridiculous
result
but
there
was
no
fear
of
that
and
evidently
deb
knew
it
sitting
her
own
dancing
chestnut
how
her
beautiful
eyes
glowed
she
gloried
in
the
ring
of
breathless
witnesses
to
the
prowess
of
her
knight
many
a
time
did
she
scoff
and
scowl
at
the
dandyisms
which
she
deemed
effeminate
this
was
one
of
the
moments
which
showed
the
man
as
she
desired
him
through
those
fine
fingers
with
the
polished
filbert
nails
the
shortened
reins
were
drawn
and
held
as
by
clamps
of
steel
so
was
the
head
by
the
lock
of
mane
in
the
same
hand
when
no
one
was
looking
although
every
eye
believed
itself
fixed
upon
him
his
left
foot
found
its
stirrup
his
right
gave
a
hop
and
like
lightning
he
had
sprung
up
and
round
without
touching
the
horse
until
fairly
down
in
the
saddle
so
that
the
animal
was
robbed
of
his
best
chance
of
getting
the
rider
off
which
is
at
the
moment
before
he
is
quite
on
no
other
chance
was
offered
to
the
baffled
one
although
he
kicked
like
a
demon
for
nearly
ten
minutes
i
wish
guthrie
carey
ground
through
his
strong
teeth
that
the
cranky
beast
would
break
his
neck
it
was
not
the
beast
neck
he
meant
but
deb
called
bravo
well
done
indeed
and
when
the
battle
was
over
called
the
victor
to
her
with
her
lovely
face
of
pride
and
joy
right
willingly
he
went
and
they
sailed
away
together
like
the
wind
and
were
lost
to
view
yes
this
was
dalzell
hour
she
knew
nothing
of
the
brave
deeds
of
common
and
constant
as
eating
and
drinking
and
performed
to
no
audience
and
for
no
reward
alice
urquhart
and
rose
pennycuick
also
on
horseback
followed
the
flying
pair
then
a
buggy
containing
jim
and
schoolgirl
francie
her
governess
gone
home
for
holidays
today
and
a
load
of
ironwork
for
a
blacksmith
on
the
route
last
of
all
mary
and
the
sailor
for
all
the
world
like
the
old
father
and
mother
of
the
party
mr
pennycuick
excused
himself
from
excursions
nowadays
and
so
did
miss
keene
the
elderly
and
quite
uninfluential
duenna
of
the
house
when
one
was
needed
she
did
the
flowers
and
knitted
singlets
for
everybody
the
shetlands
pattered
along
at
a
great
rate
but
did
not
come
up
with
the
riders
until
they
were
nearly
at
bundaboo
and
all
the
way
a
long
way
guthrie
carey
had
to
make
efforts
not
to
bore
his
hostess
they
talked
about
the
clear
air
and
the
land
the
richest
in
the
colony
but
now
without
a
blade
of
green
upon
it
and
made
comments
upon
three
bullock
drays
piled
with
wool
bales
and
two
camping
sundowners
and
one
chinaman
hawker
cart
which
they
encountered
on
the
way
and
that
was
about
all
the
was
a
different
affair
tea
had
been
served
in
mr
thornycroft
cool
hats
and
gloves
had
been
collected
orders
sent
to
the
stables
and
the
young
sailor
panting
to
emulate
the
prowess
of
his
rival
and
thereby
compel
miss
deborah
to
respect
him
was
asking
one
and
another
what
were
the
arrangements
for
the
return
journey
i
said
rose
who
hugged
a
puppy
in
her
arms
a
puppy
long
possessed
but
only
now
old
enough
to
leave
its
mother
i
am
going
in
the
buggy
with
jim
would
you
rather
go
in
the
inquired
carey
anxiously
you
could
make
a
better
lap
on
the
lower
seat
i
could
ride
your
horse
home
for
you
if
they
lend
me
a
saddle
yours
could
be
put
in
the
buggy
even
as
he
spoke
deb
came
round
the
corner
from
somewhere
with
swift
steps
and
a
brilliant
complexion
dalzell
hurrying
after
her
mr
carey
she
called
while
the
sailor
was
still
yards
away
from
her
molly
and
i
are
going
to
change
skirts
i
am
tired
with
my
ride
this
morning
and
am
going
to
drive
home
will
you
trust
your
neck
to
me
would
he
not
indeed
he
was
but
a
pawn
in
the
game
but
what
did
that
matter
eighteen
miles
absolutely
alone
with
her
and
possibly
half
of
them
in
the
dark
no
saddle
horse
in
the
world
could
have
tempted
him
now
he
could
hardly
speak
his
gratitude
and
joy
delighted
miss
deborah
delighted
delighted
but
dalzell
black
as
thunder
swung
aside
muttering
in
his
teeth
oh
oh
francie
loud
whisper
followed
did
you
hear
what
he
said
he
said
that
because
you
cut
along
jim
drawl
broke
in
and
get
ready
if
you
want
to
ride
mr
thornycroft
tucked
deb
into
the
with
the
solicitude
of
a
mother
fixing
up
a
young
baby
going
out
with
its
nurse
he
insisted
that
she
should
wear
a
shawl
over
her
linen
jacket
and
brought
forth
an
armful
of
softest
wool
indian
wove
where
did
you
get
this
she
asked
fondling
it
for
she
loved
fine
fabrics
never
mind
said
he
put
it
on
i
am
suspicious
of
these
shawls
and
fallals
that
bundaboo
seems
full
of
who
is
the
hidden
lady
he
only
smiled
at
her
ah
godpapa
you
spoil
me
she
drew
the
wrap
about
her
and
he
assisted
to
adjust
it
with
gentle
skill
then
he
turned
abruptly
to
carey
as
to
a
groom
see
that
she
does
throw
that
off
it
will
be
chilly
presently
no
she
better
drive
she
knows
the
road
but
take
care
of
her
is
he
an
old
dear
said
deb
to
carey
as
they
drove
off
he
has
been
a
second
father
to
me
ever
since
i
was
a
child
she
did
not
hurry
the
ponies
being
anxious
not
to
appear
to
be
tearing
after
her
offended
swain
the
evening
is
the
pleasantest
time
to
be
out
this
weather
she
said
lolling
back
in
her
seat
and
i
sure
i
do
want
to
look
at
dinner
after
such
a
lunch
as
i
have
eaten
i
do
know
how
you
feel
i
feel
the
same
he
assured
her
with
truth
so
for
her
own
purposes
she
made
their
drive
half
as
long
again
as
it
need
have
been
and
was
so
friendly
so
free
so
intimate
leading
that
poor
innocent
to
the
belief
that
his
great
rival
was
already
virtually
out
of
his
way
he
was
an
unsophisticated
who
with
that
rival
help
had
reached
a
certain
stage
and
crisis
another
one
of
his
man
life
and
let
us
be
honest
in
our
diagnosis
the
bubbles
of
mr
thornycroft
fine
champagne
still
ran
in
his
blood
and
brightened
his
brain
lifting
him
above
the
prosaic
where
a
craven
timidity
would
have
smothered
him
not
touching
the
balance
of
his
wits
be
it
understood
just
heartening
him
no
more
twice
and
thrice
she
branched
off
from
the
road
to
show
him
something
that
could
well
have
waited
for
another
day
she
was
imprudent
enough
to
introduce
him
to
so
sentimental
a
spot
as
the
family
cemetery
established
at
a
time
when
there
were
only
dalzells
and
pennycuicks
to
feed
it
their
shepherds
were
killed
by
the
blacks
said
deb
as
she
pushed
the
ponies
up
to
the
wall
and
he
rose
in
the
carriage
to
look
over
the
top
and
they
buried
them
here
marking
the
place
with
a
pile
of
stones
there
were
other
deaths
and
they
enclosed
the
piece
of
land
then
a
brother
of
mr
dalzell
and
a
girl
and
mr
dalzell
himself
wished
to
be
put
here
beside
his
brother
not
his
wife
she
would
she
lies
in
the
melbourne
cemetery
then
some
of
our
babies
then
mother
she
was
the
last
i
do
suppose
there
will
be
any
more
now
the
state
will
insist
on
taking
charge
of
us
real
english
churchyard
elms
crowded
about
the
wall
and
blightingly
overshadowed
the
lonely
group
of
graves
english
ivy
instead
of
neatly
clothing
the
wall
as
it
had
been
meant
to
do
straggled
wildly
over
the
part
of
the
enclosure
which
had
once
been
a
garden
around
them
out
of
it
like
wrecks
dead
sticks
of
poked
up
and
ragged
things
that
had
gone
to
seed
the
turf
was
parched
away
like
the
grass
of
the
surrounding
paddocks
the
mounds
were
cracked
the
several
of
them
ornate
and
costly
stained
with
the
drip
from
the
trees
and
birds
and
some
distinctly
out
of
the
perpendicular
it
ought
not
to
look
like
this
deb
apologised
for
it
it
ought
to
have
been
seen
to
we
used
to
come
often
and
bring
water
from
the
dam
but
one
forgets
as
time
goes
on
one
does
think
or
care
poor
dead
people
how
out
of
it
they
are
and
we
shall
be
the
same
some
day
neglected
and
abandoned
just
like
this
do
muttered
guthrie
carey
shivering
the
ghost
of
his
sweet
lily
seemed
to
reproach
him
with
deb
voice
but
the
fifteen
months
old
had
no
chance
with
the
glowing
live
woman
born
into
his
life
but
yesterday
and
no
blame
to
him
either
and
no
wrong
to
the
dead
if
one
can
look
at
the
thing
dispassionately
and
with
an
unbiased
mind
let
us
go
and
see
the
dam
deb
cheered
him
as
she
turned
the
heads
you
have
seen
our
big
dam
have
you
everybody
that
comes
to
redford
must
see
that
or
father
will
want
to
know
the
reason
why
folly
some
people
call
it
because
he
spent
so
much
money
on
it
but
father
is
not
one
to
spoil
the
ship
for
a
of
paint
he
likes
to
do
things
thoroughly
so
do
i
and
soon
they
halted
on
the
embankment
of
a
sheet
of
water
shining
like
a
mirror
in
a
setting
of
hills
their
dun
day
colour
changed
to
a
heavenly
under
the
poetic
evening
sky
why
it
is
a
lake
said
guthrie
carey
you
could
hold
regattas
on
it
we
do
now
and
then
with
our
little
boats
we
have
three
over
there
pointing
with
her
whip
to
a
white
shed
on
the
farther
shore
and
swimming
matches
we
used
sometimes
when
we
were
younger
to
come
down
on
hot
nights
and
be
mermaids
once
we
moored
ourselves
out
in
the
middle
away
from
the
mosquitoes
and
slept
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
under
the
stars
how
charming
it
was
holiday
time
and
our
parents
were
away
we
took
cushions
and
things
and
it
was
great
fun
but
keziah
reported
us
and
we
were
never
allowed
to
do
it
again
they
sat
in
the
on
the
dam
embankment
gazing
silently
a
flock
of
wildfowl
had
been
scared
away
by
their
approach
and
now
not
a
wing
not
an
eye
was
near
at
a
great
distance
curlews
wailed
only
to
make
the
stillness
and
solitude
more
exquisite
more
profound
the
purple
of
the
hills
grew
deeper
and
softer
the
lake
a
mere
pulseless
shimmer
through
the
twilight
haze
and
then
last
touch
of
magic
the
moon
swam
up
the
same
moon
that
had
transfigured
five
creeks
garden
and
alice
urquhart
last
night
he
poured
out
his
soul
to
deborah
pennycuick
first
it
was
only
the
story
of
the
baby
the
story
he
had
told
alice
with
some
omissions
and
additions
he
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
ask
deb
invaluable
advice
deb
well
aware
of
the
influence
of
a
summer
night
and
certain
accessories
tried
her
best
to
be
practical
she
asked
straight
questions
about
the
baby
where
have
you
got
him
where
does
this
friend
live
who
has
been
recommended
to
you
in
sandridge
all
at
sandridge
that
dirty
low
part
that
no
place
to
rear
a
boy
in
bring
him
into
the
bush
to
clean
air
if
you
want
to
make
a
man
of
him
i
know
a
dear
nice
woman
she
is
our
overseer
wife
who
has
no
children
and
is
dying
to
get
hold
of
one
somehow
or
other
we
might
make
some
arrangement
with
her
i
am
sure
and
if
so
the
little
fellow
would
be
in
clover
we
all
look
after
him
of
course
while
you
were
at
sea
oh
oh
oh
the
young
father
heart
simply
exhaled
itself
in
gratitude
too
vast
for
words
ah
there
was
no
hanging
back
now
not
the
baby
only
but
the
was
laid
at
deborah
feet
you
go
and
fetch
him
tomorrow
said
she
and
i
talk
to
mrs
kelsey
while
you
are
away
then
i
meet
you
at
the
station
on
your
return
to
help
you
with
him
and
tell
you
what
mrs
kelsey
says
though
i
have
no
doubt
of
what
it
will
be
but
we
keep
him
at
redford
for
a
bit
till
he
gets
used
to
everybody
and
you
must
stay
with
him
all
you
can
until
your
ship
sails
his
eyes
were
full
of
tears
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
shawl
again
he
leaned
to
her
it
was
no
use
the
moon
and
his
feelings
were
too
much
for
him
they
were
talking
of
the
baby
and
the
word
love
had
not
been
and
was
not
going
to
be
mentioned
but
there
the
thing
was
unmistakable
to
her
keen
intelligence
looming
like
a
frontier
on
the
road
ahead
she
grasped
his
big
trembling
hand
and
with
it
held
him
back
meeting
his
adoring
gaze
with
steady
eyes
and
mouth
my
dear
boy
do
do
do
spoil
this
nice
evening
it
was
all
that
was
necessary
and
still
so
kind
so
gentle
with
him
no
scorn
no
offended
dignity
no
displeasure
even
she
who
could
punish
insolence
with
anybody
was
never
hard
upon
the
humble
admirer
only
too
soft
in
fact
with
all
her
basic
firmness
and
incapable
of
the
coquetry
that
so
commonly
makes
beauty
vile
face
of
waxen
angel
with
paw
of
desert
beast
that
was
not
deborah
pennycuick
a
sob
broke
from
him
i
am
a
damned
fool
he
muttered
savagely
and
by
a
violent
effort
collected
himself
i
beg
your
pardon
that
all
right
she
said
turning
the
ponies
from
the
embankment
and
whipping
them
to
a
gallop
chapter
vii
there
was
a
moon
the
next
night
also
it
did
not
appreciably
affect
him
this
time
down
in
dirty
sandridge
hobnobbing
with
the
caretaker
and
the
general
merchant
who
shutting
his
shop
at
six
was
free
to
make
the
sailor
acquaintance
and
help
him
to
spend
a
pleasant
evening
but
it
turned
redford
garden
with
its
fine
old
trees
and
lawns
into
the
usual
bit
of
fairyland
for
those
who
strayed
therein
redford
was
packed
with
christmas
guests
the
waggonette
that
had
taken
guthrie
carey
to
the
train
had
returned
full
of
them
and
batches
had
been
arriving
at
intervals
through
the
day
at
the
sisters
were
sharing
rooms
rose
had
come
to
deb
frances
to
mary
and
the
unmarried
men
were
all
at
the
bachelors
quarters
it
was
a
hot
night
and
deb
under
the
circumstances
was
disinclined
for
sleep
she
paid
visits
to
one
guest
chamber
and
another
for
private
gossips
and
when
she
returned
to
her
own
where
placid
rose
had
long
composed
herself
she
roamed
the
floor
like
a
caged
animal
it
is
no
use
my
coming
to
bed
yet
she
addressed
her
sister
i
could
not
sleep
i
should
only
kick
about
and
disturb
you
i
sit
down
and
read
a
bit
she
found
a
novel
and
an
and
made
deliberate
efforts
to
tranquillise
herself
soon
rose
heard
sighs
and
phews
and
sudden
rustlings
and
slappings
and
then
the
bang
of
a
book
upon
the
floor
i
ca
read
and
the
light
brings
the
mosquitoes
it
too
hot
in
here
i
going
out
to
get
cool
rosie
mumbled
drowsy
rose
and
the
light
was
extinguished
and
the
blind
of
the
french
window
rattled
up
deb
flung
both
leaves
wide
like
all
the
redford
doors
they
were
never
locked
or
barred
and
drifting
over
the
verandah
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
it
with
her
feet
on
the
gravel
she
had
tossed
off
her
pearl
necklace
and
a
of
wilted
roses
otherwise
she
sat
in
full
evening
dress
and
the
night
air
bathed
her
bare
neck
and
arms
also
the
mosquitoes
found
them
a
delicious
morsel
so
that
she
had
to
turn
her
lacy
skirt
up
over
her
head
to
be
quite
comfortable
from
under
this
hood
the
dark
lamps
of
her
eyes
shone
forth
gazing
steadily
into
the
dim
world
into
the
bit
of
future
that
she
thought
she
saw
unveiled
the
loom
of
the
trees
the
glimmer
of
flowering
bushes
the
open
spaces
of
lawn
and
pallid
pathways
the
translucent
sky
the
rising
moon
these
things
made
the
picture
but
were
to
all
intents
invisible
to
the
inward
sight
she
really
saw
nothing
until
suddenly
a
spark
appeared
out
of
the
shadows
moved
along
a
hedge
of
laurels
and
fixed
itself
in
the
neighbourhood
of
a
distant
then
at
once
she
stiffened
like
a
cat
that
has
heard
a
mouse
squeak
or

wing
rustle
she
was
alert
on
the
instant
concentrated
upon
the
phenomenon
instinct
recognised
the
tip
of
a
cigar
which
had
the
handsome
face
of
claud
dalzell
behind
it
what
is
he
doing
out
of
doors
at
this
time
of
night
she
wondered
and
the
little
star
began
to
draw
her
like
a
magnet
the
world
becomes
another
world
in
these
mystic
hours
it
has
new
rulers
and
new
laws
or
rather
it
has
none
the
moon
sways
more
than
ocean
tides
in
broad
day
deb
would
no
more
have
stalked
a
man
than
she
would
a
crocodile
in
this
soft
free
empty
irresponsible
night
the
primal
woman
was
out
of
her
husk
one
with
the
animal
that
calls
through
the
moonlit
silence
for
its
mate
twenty
times
had
she
snubbed
an
ardent
lover
at
the
behest
of
all
sorts
of
reasons
and
instincts
cultivated
for
her
guidance
by
generations
of
wise
men
now
all
in
a
moment
came
this
impulse
to
give
herself
to
him
unasked
she
could
not
resist
it
like
deb
claud
had
not
been
inclined
to
sleep
and
for
much
the
same
reason
the
guest
chamber
usually
allotted
to
him
being
needed
for
a
lady
he
had
been
sent
to
the
bachelors
quarters
a
dormitory
amongst
the
outbuildings
very
useful
for
the
accommodation
of
the
occasional
or
and
to
take
the
overflow
of
company
on
festive
occasions
jim
urquhart
when
at
redford
always
slept
there
he
preferred
it
particularly
when
he
had
companions
with
whom
to
smoke
and
talk
sheep
and
perhaps
play
cards
at
liberty
for
the
bachelors
quarters
had
its
own
and
supplies
and
one
could
sit
by
a
blazing
hearth
all
night
if
so
disposed
without
incommoding
anybody
generally
four
bachelor
beds
were
made
up
and
a
screened
end
of
the
room
stacked
with
the
material
for
twice
as
many
more
at
christmas
all
were
in
use
and
lined
the
two
long
walls
which
dalzell
called
herding
and
disliked
extremely
while
recognising
that
it
was
a
necessary
arrangement
to
which
it
was
his
duty
to
conform
the
herd
was
undressing
itself
in
a
miscellaneous
manner
yawning
chaffing
cutting
stupid
jokes
some
of
them
at
his
expense
until
the
process
was
at
an
end
and
he
could
reasonably
assume
the
fellows
to
be
asleep
he
preferred
the
gardens
to
the
bachelors
quarters
and
the
free
night
enfolded
him
the
rising
moon
uplifted
him
in
the
usual
way
he
being
like
deb
like
guthrie
carey
an
instrument
fitted
to
respond
to
their
mute
appeals
perhaps
even
more
finely
fitted
than
guthrie
or
deb
for
he
had
what
are
called
gifts
of
intellect
and
imagination
transcending
theirs
faculties
of
mind
which
lacking
worthy
use
bred
in
him
a
sort
of
chronic
melancholy
the
poetic
discontent
of
the
unappreciated
and
misunderstood
a
mood
to
which
moonlight
ministers
as
wine
to
the
drinking
fever
at
once
an
exquisite
exasperation
and
a
divine
appeasement
he
was
a
poet
a
painter
a
musician
possibly
a
soldier
or
a
king
possibly
anything
spoiled
blighted
by
that
misnamed
good
fortune
which
the
lucky
workers
who
had
to
work
so
naturally
and
stupidly
envied
him
the
proper
stimulus
to
the
worthy
development
of
the
manhood
latent
in
him
had
been
taken
from
him
at
the
start
and
now
he
wandered
amongst
his
dilettantisms
dissatisfied
and
ineffectual
he
lived
beneath
himself
in
his
common
intercourse
with
others
he
ate
his
heart
when
he
was
alone
unconsciously
by
force
of
habit
he
selected
the
most
comfortable
and
cleanly
of
the
and
made
sure
that
the
best
of
cigars
was
drawing
perfectly
before
he
gave
himself
to
his
meditations
on
this
particular
moonlight
night
then
he
began
to
think
of
deb
in
the
same
new
way
that
carey
had
begun
to
think
of
her
after
discovering
a
dangerous
rival
in
the
field
to
claud
guthrie
was
dangerous
in
his
rude
bulk
and
strength
the
knitted
brute
power
that
the
sea
and
his
hard
life
had
given
him
to
guthrie
claud
was
dangerous
in
the
highbred
beauty
and
finish
of
his
person
clothes
and
manners
and
in
the
astounding
cleverness
that
he
displayed
each
man
feared
the
force
of
those
qualities
which
he
lacked
himself
and
was
secretly
ashamed
of
lacking
claud
dalzell
considered
this
matter
of
the
rival
not
a
probable
but
a
possible
rival
seriously
for
the
first
time
hitherto
he
had
had
an
easy
mind
in
his
relations
with
the
beauty
of
the
countryside
she
was
his
for
all
he
wanted
of
her
and
feeling
this
he
had
taken
no
steps
to
register
his
claim
he
had
not
even
yet
proposed
to
her
matrimony
was
not
a
fashionable
institution
it
was
indeed
a
jest
in
his
set
a
young
man
with
a
heap
of
money
was
not
expected
to
tie
himself
down
as
if
he
were
a
poor
clerk
on
a
hundred
a
year
the
conditions
of
club
life
with
as
many
domestic
hearths
to
visit
as
he
wished
and
to
stay
away
from
when
he
chose
the
luxury
and
freedom
of
pampered
bachelorhood
had
not
only
been
deemed
appropriate
but
necessary
to
his
peculiar
needs
and
organisation
he
had
not
considered
himself
a
marrying
man
but
now
the
new
idea
came
to
him
to
make
his
rights
in
deb
secure
certainly
he
could
not
contemplate
the
possibility
of
doing
without
her
he
had
loved
her
that
much
for
years
within
the
last
day
or
two
he
had
loved
her
twice
that
much
and
now
the
moonlight
showed
him
his
love
enthroned
above
all
his
lesser
loves
a
thing
of
heaven
where
they
were
of
the
earth
consecrated
a
great
passion
to
lift
him
out
of
himself
he
sat
and
smoked
spiritually
bemused
his
brain
running
like
a
fountain
with
melodies
of
music
and
poetry
notes
and
words
that
sang
in
his
ears
and
murmured
on
his
lips
without
his
hearing
them
so
a
distant
curlew
thrilled
him
to
a
more
ecstatic
melancholy
with
its
call
through
the
world
and
he
did
not
notice
it
all
the
influences
of
the
gentle
night
contributed
to
his
inspired
mood
but
love
was
the
first
violin
in
that
orchestra
under
conductorship
nature
whose
hour
it
was
walking
a
god
in
the
garden
of
eden
in
the
cool
of
the
day
and
here
came
deb
gliding
towards
him
by
a
path
that
he
could
not
see
holding
her
lace
skirts
tightly
bunched
in
her
nervous
hands
youth
to
youth
beauty
to
beauty
man
to
woman
woman
to
man
the
magnet
to
the
steel
they
were
just
elements
of
the
elements
for
once
in
their
lives
how
fortunate
that
i
put
on
black
tonight
thought
deb
as
she
pursued
her
stealthy
way
at
the
back
of
bushes
and
something
that
does
not
rustle
how
beautiful
she
was
tonight
thought
claud
how
a
dark
dress
throws
up
that
superb
neck
of
hers
i
take
her
to
europe
and
show
her
to
the
sculptors
and
painters
but
where
the
hand
that
could
carve
that
shape
or
the
paint
that
could
give
her
colour
i
have
a
london
season
with
her
and
see
her
snuff
out
the
debutantes
no
about
deb
wine
and
fire
and
withal
so
proud
and
unapproachable
that
hulking
brute
imagines
but
he
find
his
mistake
if
he
attempts
to
cross
the
line
beauty
passion
purity
what
a
blend
she
a
woman
alone
the
blue
rose
of
women
and
she
is
mine
he
murmured
to
some
cadence
of
a
schubert
serenade
my
deb
my
love
my
love
my
queen
and
suddenly
stopped
short
in
his
musings
her
foot
crunched
the
gravel
behind
him
without
turning
his
head
he
sat
alertly
motionless
for
several
minutes
listening
holding
his
breath
then
he
dropped
his
cigar
gently
fine
night
deb
he
remarked
aloud
there
was
no
immediate
answer
but
presently
a
low
chuckle
from
the
laurel
bushes
how
did
you
know
it
was
me
she
asked
imitating
his
casual
tone
could
explain
i
sure
it
was
borne
in
on
me
somehow
you
did
not
see
me
i
do
want
to
see
in
your
case
i
feel
you
there
was
another
brief
silence
and
then
she
rustled
off
a
step
or
two
well
i
just
came
out
to
look
for
a
book
i
left
here
somewhere
what
book
it
does
matter
it
is
too
late
to
read
tonight
anyhow
it
spoils
books
to
leave
them
out
all
night
i
will
help
you
to
find
it
he
got
up
and
pretended
to
look
about
it
is
not
on
this
seat
perhaps
miss
keene
has
taken
it
in
she
is
always
after
me
to
pick
up
my
litters
it
wo
rain
anyway
so
it
does
matter
no
it
wo
rain
tonight
awfully
nice
night
is
it
i
came
over
here
to
get
a
quiet
smoke
and
let
those
fellows
subside
a
bit
i
could
not
stand
their
noise
and
the
place
is
stifling
i
afraid
so
i
so
sorry
we
have
to
put
you
there
but
you
know
oh
of
course
i
do
mind
a
bit
it
is
hot
indoors
wherever
you
are
if
it
were
not
for
the
mosquitoes
it
would
be
nice
to
sleep
in
hammocks
under
the
trees
this
weather
i
have
often
thought
so
i
ca
breathe
shut
up
rose
is
in
my
room
tonight
and
she
seems
like
a
whole
crowd
i
had
to
come
out
to
cool
myself
and
to
get
your
book
what
book
was
it
the
er
clough
poems
how
many
copies
have
you
because
one
of
them
has
been
in
my
pocket
for
two
days
well
i
do
want
it
she
put
out
her
hand
he
took
it
and
held
it
the
moonlight
now
was
very
bright
but
not
bright
enough
to
reveal
his
smile
or
her
blush
however
neither
could
be
hidden
from
the
second
sight
of
love
go
yet
debbie
i
never
get
a
word
with
you
these
days
you
are
so
taken
up
with
all
sorts
of
people
and
you
have
had
time
to
get
cool
yet
i
know
you
have
by
the
feel
of
your
hand
she
tried
to
withdraw
it
but
did
not
try
very
hard
my
dear
boy
she
trembled
do
you
know
what
time
it
is
it
must
be
simply
all
hours
what
does
that
matter
we
are
not
keeping
anybody
up
and
tomorrow
to
be
considered
christmas
eve
is
always
such
a
busy
tiring
sufficient
for
the
day
let
us
take
things
as
we
can
get
them
besides
you
will
sleep
all
the
better
for
it
five
minutes
more
or
less
he
pulled
gently
but
firmly
at
the
imprisoned
hand
well
just
five
minutes
although
it
really
she
was
drawn
down
to
the
bench
beside
him
and
the
man
in
the
moon
as
he
looked
into
their
shining
happy
eyes
seemed
to
wink
knowingly
oh
debbie
is
it
a
heavenly
night
oh
debbie
his
arms
went
round
her
and
she
simply
melted
into
them
oh
my
love
five
minutes
it
ran
to
an
hour
and
a
half
before
she
scudded
across
the
lawn
to
bed
and
it
was
mary
the
busy
housekeeper
who
on
her
busiest
day
drove
to
the
station
to
meet
guthrie
carey
and
the
baby
and
the
baby
cheap
and
temporary
mary
though
she
was
not
deb
was
too
sweet
and
good
for
words
she
put
the
little
hired
girl
on
the
front
seat
with
the
groom
and
sat
in
the
body
of
the
waggonette
to
talk
to
guthrie
and
to
take
care
of
his
child
there
was
no
awkward
shyness
on
her
part
now
and
no
boredom
on
his
little
harry
fused
them
she
had
remembered
to
bring
fresh
milk
and
rusks
for
a
possibly
hungry
baby
and
he
sat
on
her
lap
as
she
fed
him
and
cooed
to
her
when
his
mouth
was
not
too
full
and
seemed
to
forget
that
any
other
had
ever
existed
his
relieved
and
astonished
pleasure
in
the
sight
was
only
equalled
by
mary
pleasure
in
seeing
his
pleasure
is
he
a
jolly
little
cuss
miss
pennycuick
he
is
a
perfect
darling
crooned
mary
kissing
him
and
in
fact
harry
carey
was
a
fine
clean
wholesome
child
as
worthy
of
his
old
family
as
any
born
under
the
ancestral
roof
mary
shouldered
him
as
if
he
belonged
to
her
when
they
arrived
at
redford
shortly
before
the
dinner
hour
now
mr
carey
you
must
go
to
the
bachelors
quarters
i
am
sorry
to
say
but
he
will
not
miss
you
since
you
have
been
away
from
him
for
so
long
he
knows
me
now
said
mary
proudly
and
i
will
take
charge
of
him
you
may
safely
leave
him
to
us
now
indeed
yes
i
know
that
said
the
thankful
parent
and
hastened
to
his
new
quarters
to
receive
the
greetings
and
chaffings
of
the
young
bachelors
and
to
dress
himself
for
dinner
while
mary
carried
the
baby
into
the
house
calling
on
keziah
moon
to
come
to
her
the
inadequate
trailing
at
her
heels
the
house
party
gathered
in
the
glazed
corridor
of
the
middle
part
a
long
narrow
room
that
had
once
been
a
verandah
and
that
led
to
the
new
big
to
await
the
summons
to
the
meal
here
deb
beautiful
in
limp
white
silk
that
showed
up
the
lovely
carmine
of
her
cheeks
came
forward
to
welcome
the
returned
guest
with
an
eager
warmth
that
sadly
misled
him
he
sat
down
to
his
dinner
a
few
minutes
later
with
his
head
in
a
whirl
and
his
appetite
nowhere
as
an
effect
of
that
cordial
pressure
of
the
hand
those
tender
eyes
and
that
blush
upon
him
then
as
he
came
to
himself
there
crept
into
his
mind
a
sense
that
things
had
been
happening
while
he
was
away
all
the
eyes
around
the
table
seemed
continually
to
turn
either
towards
deb
who
still
flushed
and
bestowing
smiles
upon
anybody
and
anything
was
certainly
different
from
her
usual
stately
self
or
upon
claud
dalzell
who
sat
beside
her
and
seemed
to
have
appropriated
some
of
her
lost
dignity
or
upon
mr
pennycuick
who
fumbled
oddly
with
carving
knife
and
gravy
spoon
and
gave
other
evidences
guthrie
thought
of
having
been
upset
and
shaken
the
young
man
was
still
fumbling
himself
for
light
upon
these
mysteries
when
they
were
dispelled
by
a
shock
that
for
the
moment
stunned
him
mr
pennycuick
called
for
a
certain
brand
of
wine
long
famous
at
his
board
when
it
came
and
the
bottles
were
being
sent
round
he
stood
up
with
a
trembling
goblet
in
his
hand
the
eyes
round
the
table
dropped
all
but
guthrie
which
stared
at
the
old
man
there
no
time
like
the
present
began
the
host
if
a
thing
has
to
be
done
he
repeated
this
strange
and
embarrassing
introductory
remark
and
then
spent
some
time
in
clearing
his
throat
and
blowing
his
nose
and
trying
to
wipe
up
the
wine
he
was
shaking
over
when
the
fidgets
had
seized
upon
the
whole
company
he
rushed
his
fence
ahem
i
must
ask
you
my
friends
to
fill
your
glasses
in
honour
of
an
event
an
event
that
has
just
transpired
in
our
midst
that
that
i
am
sure
will
interest
you
all
that
in
short
my
dear
daughter
deborah
and
the
man
of
her
choice
who
knows
i
hope
what
a
lucky
dog
he
is
he
does
claud
interjected
and
there
was
eager
all
round
the
table
everyone
again
excepting
guthrie
leaning
forward
to
cast
wreathed
smiles
at
the
seated
couple
i
have
given
my
consent
said
mr
pennycuick
i
have
given
my
consent
my
daughter
shall
be
happy
in
her
own
way
and
i
hope
he
see
to
it
that
she
gets
all
she
bargains
for
he
is
the
son
of
my
oldest
friend
a
man
that
was
better
than
a
brother
to
me
the
whitest
straightest
but
there
no
words
to
say
what
he
was
only
the
son
of
such
a
man
anybody
with
billy
blood
in
him
ought
to
be
if
he
is
he
is
sang
deb
in
her
rich
ringing
voice
oh
please
do
say
any
more
father
well
my
dear
i
know
i
am
no
hand
at
but
i
can
wish
you
luck
both
of
you
and
i
do
and
i
want
our
friends
here
old
friends
of
the
family
to
do
the
same
good
wishes
may
bring
good
fortune
but
for
all
we
know
they
may
do
something
towards
it
and
anyway
she
may
as
well
have
all
her
chances
ladies
and
gentlemen
long
life
and
happiness
to
deborah
pennycuick
and
her
husband
that
is
to
be
a
general
turmoil
broke
out
cheers
handshakings
kissings
with
a
sob
or
two
from
the
overwrought
and
guthrie
with
no
heart
upon
his
sleeve
bowed
and
drank
with
the
rest
when
the
demonstration
was
over
and
the
company
back
in
its
chairs
dalzell
was
left
standing
his
sat
beside
him
her
elbow
on
the
table
her
face
shaded
by
her
hand
on
behalf
of
my
dear
wife
that
is
to
be
said
claud
with
a
quiet
mastery
of
himself
that
was
in
striking
contrast
to
the
old
agitation
and
as
a
grateful
duty
of
my
own
i
beg
to
thank
you
all
and
especially
mr
pennycuick
for
this
great
kindness
for
your
generous
sympathy
with
us
in
our
present
happiness
mr
pennycuick
seems
to
have
a
doubt
natural
to
anyone
in
the
circumstances
but
inevitable
in
a
father
the
father
of
such
a
daughter
as
to
my
being
qualified
to
appreciate
the
gift
he
has
just
bestowed
upon
me
i
can
assure
him
and
all
of
you
that
i
am
overwhelmed
with
the
sense
of
my
good
fortune
and
of
my
unworthiness
of
it
i
am
unworthy
i
admit
it
but
it
shall
be
the
business
of
my
life
to
correct
that
fault
if
it
is
a
fault
and
not
merely
a
misfortune
that
i
can
not
help
to
the
best
of
my
power
i
will
prove
by
deeds
not
words
that
i
do
know
her
value
deb
hand
under
the
table
here
stole
towards
his
that
hung
at
his
side
and
he
stood
holding
it
until
he
finished
speaking
fortune
has
been
kind
in
granting
me
the
means
to
surround
her
with
material
comfort
to
give
so
rare
a
jewel
the
setting
appropriate
to
it
for
the
rest
i
must
trust
to
her
generosity
i
feel
quite
safe
in
trusting
to
it
we
have
known
each
other
i
believe
we
have
loved
each
other
from
childhood
i
hope
mr
pennycuick
will
take
that
as
some
guarantee
that
his
little
misgivings
are
unnecessary
the
orator
twisted
his
moustache
and
glanced
down
at
the
bowed
head
beside
him
she
seems
to
be
a
little
taken
aback
by
the
suddenness
of
this
public
announcement
but
i
can
say
that
it
does
not
come
a
moment
too
soon
for
me
mr
pennycuick
has
made
me
a
proud
man
i
glory
in
my
position
as
his
daughter
affianced
husband
i
wish
to
parade
it
as
openly
as
possible
however
to
spare
her
i
will
say
no
more
just
now
ladies
and
gentlemen
bowing
to
right
and
left
i
thank
you
again
he
sat
down
amid
thunders
of
applause
and
leaning
back
in
his
chair
he
looked
straight
and
full
at
guthrie
carey
guthrie
carey
erect
calm
as
a
stone
image
returned
the
look
steadily
there
was
absolutely
no
expression
in
his
eyes
chapter
viii
carey
junior
joined
the
christmas
party
after
breakfast
and
was
handed
round
mary
introduced
him
he
was
with
shining
cheeks
and
a
damp
and
glossy
and
his
blue
eyes
stared
at
the
strange
crowd
stolidly
for
several
minutes
before
he
suddenly
crumpled
up
his
face
and
uttered
a
howl
of
terror
what
is
it
queried
dalzell
with
raised
brows
pretending
that
he
had
never
seen
such
a
thing
before
it
a
baby
frances
explained
dancing
round
it
baby
baby
shaking
the
new
rattle
that
was
one
of
its
christmas
gifts
look
at
me
baby
it
is
mr
carey
baby
oh
come
and
speak
to
him
mr
carey
he
is
frightened
of
so
many
strangers
the
stalwart
father
in
the
background
glowered
upon
the
son
disgracing
him
red
as
beetroot
embarrassed
and
annoyed
he
strode
forward
the
yelling
infant
cast
one
glance
at
him
and
yelled
louder
than
before
i
should
have
let
him
come
the
sailor
growled
he
had
got
up
from
the
wrong
side
of
the
bed
that
morning
and
was
in
the
mood
to
regret
everything
even
that
he
had
been
born
i
do
know
what
possessed
me
to
let
you
be
bothered
with
the
brat
i
ring
for
his
nurse
this
was
unanimously
objected
to
the
ladies
gathered
round
with
honeyed
words
and
tinkling
baubles
to
pacify
the
little
guest
deborah
snatched
him
from
her
sister
arms
and
ran
with
him
into
the
garden
where
she
tossed
him
still
writhing
and
wailing
up
and
down
and
dipped
his
face
into
flowers
and
played
other
pranks
calculated
to
enchant
the
average
baby
this
baby
turned
on
her
for
her
pains
and
having
slapped
her
cheeks
grabbed
her
beautiful
hair
and
tore
it
down
about
her
ears
the
next
instant
he
felt
the
weight
of
the
hand
from
which
his
own
had
derived
its
strength
you
brute
cried
deb
shielding
the
offending
little
arm
from
a
second
blow
a
great
big
man
like
you
to
strike
a
tender
mite
like
this
is
hardly
the
word
the
irate
parent
sneered
and
mite
as
he
is
he
is
not
to
do
things
of
that
sort
guthrie
glared
at
her
sacred
locks
dishevelled
i
awfully
sorry
he
sha
do
it
again
i
take
him
away
tomorrow
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
sort
flashed
deb
you
are
not
fit
to
have
the
care
of
him
he
shall
stay
here
where
he
will
be
treated
as
a
baby
ought
to
be
not
smacked
and
knocked
about
for
nothing
at
all
i
admire
his
pluck
quoth
dalzell
sauntering
up
so
do
i
said
deb
but
she
handed
her
sobbing
burden
to
mary
here
take
him
moll
while
i
put
my
hair
up
poor
little
fellow
she
need
not
have
been
so
severe
she
might
have
known
that
it
was
because
the
cheeks
and
hair
were
hers
that
the
baby
had
been
punished
for
his
assault
on
them
she
could
have
seen
that
she
was
wringing
the
culprit
heart
perhaps
she
did
and
had
no
room
in
her
own
to
care
she
stood
on
the
sunny
garden
path
and
lifted
her
hands
to
her
head
a
lovely
pose
here
let
me
said
claud
dalzell
she
let
him
which
was
cruellest
of
all
guthrie
turned
his
murderous
eyes
from
the
group
and
sauntered
away
out
of
the
garden
out
of
their
sight
unrecalled
apparently
unnoticed
mary
carried
the
crying
child
into
the
house
then
for
an
hour
the
silly
fellow
walked
alone
in
the
most
solitary
places
that
he
could
find
revelling
in
the
thought
that
it
was
christmas
day
and
he
singled
out
by
fate
to
have
no
share
in
its
happy
circumstances
no
home
no
friends
no
love
like
other
men
nothing
to
make
life
worth
living
save
only
the
baby
son
that
he
had
apart
from
the
sting
of
deb
comment
on
it
he
repented
him
of
that
blow
a
great
big
man
like
him
to
strike
a
tender
mite
like
this
a
motherless
babe
his
precious
lily
bequest
to
him
aye
indeed
it
was
the
act
of
a
brute
whatever
the
provocation
the
mite
was
a
waif
too
alone
in
the
world
when
his
father
was
at
sea
pathetically
helpless
with
no
defence
against
blows
and
unkindness
the
reflection
brought
dimness
to
the
man
hard
blue
eyes
and
turned
his
steps
houseward
he
arrived
to
find
a
large
brake
at
the
door
the
body
was
filling
with
other
persons
the
sailor
knew
not
cared
not
whom
he
looked
up
at
the
radiant
figure
in
front
she
looked
down
on
him
with
kindness
as
if
nothing
had
happened
why
mr
carey
are
you
coming
to
church
she
called
to
him
not
not
today
i
think
he
answered
without
premeditation
christmas
day
she
hinted
invitingly
you
do
always
get
the
chance
you
know
i
know
but
thanks
i
rather
not
he
bluntly
persisted
hating
himself
for
the
churlish
response
and
all
the
time
wanting
to
go
certain
to
have
gone
if
he
had
given
himself
time
to
think
soldiers
and
sailors
with
their
habit
of
unquestioning
obedience
to
authority
are
almost
always
good
churchmen
and
as
she
had
pointed
out
this
offer
of
christian
privileges
did
not
come
to
him
every
year
he
had
not
anticipated
it
on
this
occasion
knowing
redford
to
be
situated
at
least
ten
miles
from
a
church
oh
well
said
deborah
scenting
spite
i
daresay
it
is
more
comfortable
in
the
cool
house
and
then
she
left
him
in
the
position
of
a
idler
preferring
comfort
to
duty
a
foil
to
his
more
conscientious
rival
when
the
dust
of
the
departure
had
cleared
away
he
sat
on
not
in
the
cool
house
but
on
the
hot
verandah
nursing
his
griefs
in
solitude
he
seemed
the
only
person
left
behind
or
else
he
seemed
forgotten
as
a
guest
of
no
account
what
a
christmas
day
was
again
his
thought
while
he
dragged
before
his
mind
eye
old
pictures
of
his
english
home
his
dead
mother
santa
claus
stockings
and
all
sorts
of
pathetic
things
he
resolved
to
quit
redford
on
the
morrow
and
spend
the
last
hours
of
his
leave
in
establishing
his
son
elsewhere
then
mary
pennycuick
came
out
to
him
with
that
son
in
her
arms
her
face
was
redeemed
from
its
plainness
by
the
tender
motherliness
and
the
no
less
tender
friendliness
of
its
expression
that
of
little
harry
was
cherubic
the
heart
of
the
lonely
man
warmed
to
both
he
has
come
to
tell
daddy
that
he
is
a
good
boy
now
explained
mary
proudly
guthrie
ejaculated
sonny
boy
and
held
out
his
arms
the
baby
bearing
no
malice
tumbled
into
them
and
was
at
once
occupied
with
his
father
the
three
subsided
upon
two
cane
chairs
looking
as
mary
keenly
comprehended
like
a
family
you
have
stayed
at
home
because
of
him
the
man
complained
fretfully
but
the
girl
hastened
to
perjure
herself
with
the
assertion
that
she
had
done
nothing
of
the
kind
she
then
persuaded
him
to
the
that
his
child
was
not
only
no
nuisance
to
the
house
but
its
positive
delight
and
she
earnestly
talked
him
out
of
his
cruel
resolve
to
return
it
to
bad
air
and
all
sorts
of
domestic
risks
how
can
he
be
any
burden
on
us
she
pleaded
we
need
never
see
him
unless
we
like
only
of
course
we
shall
like
it
is
entirely
an
arrangement
between
you
and
mrs
kelsey
unless
she
bethought
herself
unless
you
like
to
consider
an
idea
of
alice
urquhart
oh
no
he
broke
in
i
rather
mrs
kelsey
a
proper
business
agreement
if
i
could
feel
absolutely
certain
well
you
can
said
mary
the
beginning
and
end
of
all
the
trouble
to
us
is
our
answering
for
mrs
kelsey
she
was
once
our
nurse
and
we
know
her
ways
for
the
rest
she
is
as
independent
of
us
as
that
lady
in
sandridge
in
that
case
of
course
i
very
little
time
and
really
i
know
where
to
turn
perhaps
until
after
this
voyage
yes
then
if
you
are
dissatisfied
you
can
make
a
change
she
assumed
the
matter
settled
and
began
to
go
into
details
deb
saw
mrs
kelsey
while
you
were
away
she
willing
enough
she
says
ten
shillings
a
week
would
cover
everything
the
drainage
is
all
right
kelsey
will
see
that
he
has
one
cow
milk
they
feed
him
well
but
they
wo
give
him
rich
things
she
the
most
careful
woman
he
be
out
in
the
air
getting
strong
all
the
time
he
want
hardly
any
clothes
in
the
country
deb
says
he
be
better
without
shoes
and
socks
i
hope
he
be
kept
out
of
miss
deborah
way
after
that
exhibition
nonsense
she
was
too
rough
and
ready
with
him
and
she
did
mind
a
bit
of
course
not
she
says
she
likes
boys
to
be
boys
he
is
a
thorough
boy
mary
proudly
declared
bending
to
kiss
a
chubby
knee
harry
acknowledged
the
caress
with
a
thumping
smack
of
her
bowed
head
gently
gently
warned
the
father
amiably
now
what
do
you
say
to
our
walking
over
to
interview
mrs
kelsey
mary
pushed
her
advantage
home
i
daresay
she
will
be
busy
but
give
us
a
few
minutes
it
would
be
a
satisfaction
to
her
to
speak
to
you
herself
and
here
is
a
good
opportunity
they
wo
be
home
much
before
two
guthrie
fetched
his
straw
hat
mary
retied
the
baby
flapping
and
they
set
forth
let
me
have
him
she
begged
no
he
is
too
heavy
for
you
the
father
carried
the
child
who
loved
the
feel
of
the
strong
arms
in
which
he
jumped
up
and
down
continuing
to
make
play
with
his
sturdy
little
fists
instead
of
striking
back
guthrie
answered
the
baby
assaults
with
roars
and
gestures
that
sent
the
little
man
into
fits
of
delight
mary
laughed
in
chorus
keeping
touch
with
the
happy
creature
over
the
towering
shoulder
reared
between
them
it
was
more
than
ever
like
a
little
family
taking
its
sunday
stroll
mrs
kelsey
had
her
christmas
dinner
in
hand
but
came
to
them
in
her
big
white
apron
and
sleeves
rolled
to
her
dimpled
elbows
smiling
charming
in
her
plain
reposeful
straightforward
attitude
towards
the
visitors
and
their
mission
no
sooner
had
he
beheld
her
orderly
and
cheerful
house
looked
into
her
kind
eyes
and
heard
her
sincere
speech
than
the
young
father
was
satisfied
that
he
had
found
a
good
place
for
his
little
son
the
child
seemed
to
know
it
too
for
when
the
strange
woman
drew
him
to
her
broad
lap
calmly
as
if
used
to
doing
it
he
surrendered
himself
without
a
protest
when
presently
she
gave
him
a
drink
of
milk
and
a
biscuit
to
munch
he
regaled
himself
peaceably
with
the
air
of
feeling
quite
at
home
when
he
had
finished
his
lunch
he
played
with
a
collie
puppy
i
do
my
best
for
him
sir
and
i
not
let
these
young
ladies
spoil
him
if
i
can
help
it
said
mrs
kelsey
with
a
smile
at
mary
pennycuick
terms
had
been
arranged
and
everything
settled
i
hope
you
will
be
able
to
keep
him
from
being
any
bother
to
them
said
guthrie
earnestly
bother
crowed
mary
whose
intention
was
to
visit
the
child
daily
we
see
to
that
mr
carey
never
fear
mrs
kelsey
suggested
beginning
her
duties
with
the
aid
of
the
little
nurse
at
once
but
mary
would
not
hear
of
parting
the
boy
from
his
father
while
they
could
be
together
so
he
was
carried
back
to
redford
to
be
the
plaything
of
the
housekeeper
room
for
the
rest
of
the
day
my
baby
mary
began
to
call
him
she
had
to
preside
at
the
great
dinner
but
was
not
visible
to
her
family
for
hours
before
and
after
it
was
a
better
christmas
to
guthrie
carey
in
the
end
than
in
the
beginning
deb
came
back
from
church
chastened
in
spirit
to
make
up
to
him
for
her
unkindness
on
the
score
of
which
her
warm
heart
had
reproached
her
she
made
him
play
billiards
with
her
after
tea
while
claud
was
resting
after
his
labours
she
chaffed
him
deliciously
on
his
errors
in
the
game
she
forgot
to
ask
after
his
baby
but
she
asked
whether
it
would
not
be
possible
to
get
his
leave
extended
when
he
said
no
he
had
had
more
than
his
share
already
she
commended
him
for
his
sense
of
duty
and
in
her
seriousness
was
more
enchanting
than
in
her
fun
but
i
do
wish
we
could
have
kept
you
longer
she
flattered
him
in
her
sweet
way
however
we
shall
have
a
hostage
for
your
return
several
new
people
came
to
dinner
including
mr
goldsworthy
and
ruby
the
latter
sent
at
once
by
deb
command
to
keep
little
carey
company
spacious
redford
was
taxed
to
the
utmost
to
accommodate
its
guests
and
never
was
better
christmas
cheer
provided
in
the
old
hall
of
english
redford
than
its
son
in
exile
dispensed
under
his
australian
roof
when
every
leaf
was
put
into
the
it
was
so
long
that
mary
at
one
end
was
beyond
speaking
distance
of
her
father
at
the
other
and
those
at
the
sides
could
scarce
use
their
elbows
as
they
ate
the
banquet
was
prodigious
with
speeches
to
wind
up
with
mr
goldsworthy
in
his
oration
disgusted
deb
by
referring
to
the
host
as
princely
and
to
the
ladies
of
the
house
as
his
bevy
of
beautiful
daughters
and
if
the
truth
must
be
told
the
crowning
ceremony
of
the
loving
cup
was
a
bit
superfluous
it
found
the
host
already
fuddled
beyond
a
doubt
and
several
of
the
guests
under
suspicion
of
being
so
but
in
the
opinion
of
all
redford
had
celebrated
christmas
in
an
unsurpassably
proper
manner
two
mornings
later
a
waggonette
was
packed
with
luggage
and
four
passengers
mary
pennycuick
guthrie
carey
the
baby
and
the
little
nurse
they
proceeded
in
a
body
to
the
overseer
house
where
the
load
was
halved
mary
the
baby
and
one
box
were
left
with
mrs
kelsey
reinforced
by
the
collie
puppy
and
a
plate
of
sugared
strawberries
the
sailor
and
the
nursemaid
after
a
few
poignant
moments
went
on
to
a
distant
railway
station
have
an
easy
mind
said
mary
outside
the
parlour
door
he
will
be
well
off
with
her
and
we
shall
all
be
looking
after
him
how
can
i
thank
you
said
the
parting
guest
barely
able
to
articulate
he
wrung
her
hand
and
looked
at
her
kind
red
face
with
feelings
unspeakable
god
bless
you
god
reward
you
for
your
goodness
to
the
little
chap
and
me
he
was
including
all
the
family
in
his
benediction
and
it
was
the
father
in
him
that
was
so
touched
and
overcome
none
the
less
she
accepted
the
tribute
for
her
own
and
to
her
womanhood
it
was
wealth
indeed
she
stood
in
the
porch
to
watch
the
wheels
of
his
departing
chariot
flash
through
the
sun
and
dust
she
stared
long
at
the
vacant
point
of
disappearance
like
one
entranced
when
she
came
to
herself
she
ran
into
the
house
and
fell
upon
little
harry
my
baby
she
crooned
passionately
my
baby
carey
junior
responded
with
his
ready
fist
pushing
her
from
him
he
was
feeding
the
puppy
with
a
strawberry
and
she
put
her
head
in
the
way
fie
you
must
do
that
said
mrs
kelsey
mindful
of
her
responsibilities
that
rude
oh
let
him
pleaded
the
girl
infatuated
with
that
look
of
his
father
in
his
face
and
she
dropped
on
her
knees
before
him
and
kissed
a
dangling
foot
with
which
he
kicked
her
mouth
let
him
do
what
he
likes
so
long
as
he
happy
not
at
all
her
old
nurse
reproved
her
i
promised
mr
carey
that
he
should
not
be
spoiled
he
was
not
spoiled
the
admirable
brooking
no
interference
with
her
system
improved
him
into
a
child
as
well
as
the
healthiest
and
most
beautiful
in
all
that
countryside
it
was
a
standing
grievance
at
redford
that
she
would
not
allow
him
to
be
always
on
show
there
subject
to
mary
indulgence
and
caprices
and
the
temptations
of
the
housekeeper
only
mr
kelsey
who
was
his
idol
was
permitted
to
withdraw
him
from
mrs
kelsey
eye
the
man
used
to
take
the
child
with
a
toy
whip
in
his
little
hand
on
the
saddle
before
him
and
let
him
think
he
was
guiding
the
steady
horse
and
doing
all
the
business
of
the
station
as
well
the
overseer
confessed
in
bad
weather
when
he
had
to
ride
alone
that
he
was
lost
without
his
little
mate
hardly
weaned
he
used
to
brag
and
knows
every
beast
on
the
place
as
well
as
i
do
myself
this
was
gross
exaggeration
yet
was
the
infant
harry
a
conspicuously
forward
child
with
the
makings
of
a
man
in
him
visible
to
all
his
hearty
whoas
and
carried
as
far
as
the
overseer
gruff
voice
and
the
picture
of
the
jolly
boy
with
his
rosy
joyous
face
and
his
fair
curls
blowing
in
the
wind
was
one
to
kindle
the
admiration
of
all
who
saw
it
the
phrase
continually
on
the
lips
of
his
adopted
family
and
connections
was
his
father
be
surprised
when
he
sees
him
they
enjoyed
in
anticipation
the
grateful
praises
that
would
be
heaped
upon
them
then
but
guthrie
carey
never
saw
his
son
again
the
baby
went
with
his
to
the
local
township
and
it
was
supposed
caught
the
infection
of
typhoid
there
from
some
unknown
source
having
caught
it
the
robust
little
body
unused
to
any
ailment
was
wrecked
at
once
where
a
frail
child
might
easily
have
weathered
the
storm
no
little
prince
of
blood
royal
could
have
been
better
nursed
and
more
strenuously
fought
for
but
three
days
after
he
had
visibly
sickened
he
was
dead
and
then
the
wail
went
up
oh
what
will
his
father
say
when
guthrie
came
prepared
by
letters
from
as
bereaved
as
himself
it
was
but
from
one
day
to
the
next
only
to
hear
the
particulars
and
to
see
the
little
grave
deborah
was
away
from
home
but
in
any
case
mary
would
have
been
the
one
to
perform
the
sad
duties
of
the
occasion
they
were
hers
by
right
she
took
him
to
the
family
cemetery
on
the
only
evening
of
his
stay
and
herself
speechless
and
weeping
showed
him
the
whole
place
renovated
and
made
beautiful
for
the
sake
of
the
latest
comer
no
weeds
no
dead
no
vampire
ivy
now
but
an
orderly
garden
new
planted
and
watered
and
in
the
midst
a
small
mound
heaped
with
flowers
she
had
visited
the
child
daily
while
he
lived
at
mrs
kelsey
now
she
almost
daily
visited
his
grave
they
dropped
on
their
knees
beside
it
close
as
bride
and
bridegroom
on
altar
steps
as
father
and
mother
at
the
firstborn
cradle
the
dusk
was
melting
into
moonlight
they
could
not
see
each
other
faces
when
his
big
frame
heaved
with
heavy
sobs
she
laid
a
timid
hand
her
beautiful
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
when
he
felt
that
sympathetic
woman
touch
he
turned
suddenly
and
kissed
her
afterwards
he
did
not
remember
that
he
had
done
it
she
seemed
to
cling
to
him
when
next
morning
the
time
came
for
him
to
go
you
will
come
again
she
implored
him
in
a
trembling
whisper
you
will
come
here
when
you
return
next
time
oh
surely
he
replied
whispering
too
and
to
the
full
as
deeply
moved
but
when
he
got
away
it
was
to
other
lands
that
he
turned
his
eyes
in
the
search
for
new
interests
to
occupy
his
lonely
life
with
lily
and
the
baby
dead
and
deborah
pennycuick
given
to
another
man
australia
had
no
more
hold
on
him
his
first
letter
to
redford
notified
that
he
had
changed
into
another
line
and
that
the
name
of
his
new
ship
was
the
dovedale
she
traded
to
the
west
indies
he
forgot
to
write
again
when
not
very
long
afterwards
he
went
back
to
his
old
line
at
the
invitation
of
the
company
as
captain
of
the
ship
on
which
he
had
served
as
mate
chapter
ix
dovedale
hullo
mr
pennycuick
broke
the
silence
of
his
newspaper
reading
why
is
that
well
upon
my
soul
it
does
seem
as
if
some
folks
were
born
unlucky
here
that
poor
young
fellow
first
he
loses
a
charming
wife
before
he
been
married
any
time
and
then
the
finest
child
going
and
now
here
he
gone
himself
before
his
prime
with
no
end
of
a
career
before
him
who
cried
deb
from
the
where
she
was
helping
herself
to
a
hot
cake
young
carey
our
carey
oh
it
him
all
right
worse
luck
his
been
wrecked
and
only
two
saved
to
tell
the
tale
look
here
he
passed
the
newspaper
pressed
under
his
broad
thumb
deb
stood
to
read
the
indicated
item
while
her
father
watched
her
face
neither
of
them
noticed
mary
peculiar
appearance
nor
marked
her
departure
from
the
room
we
must
inquire
about
this
said
deb
earnestly
we
must
get
the
names
of
those
on
board
he
may
have
been
on
leave
she
was
a
prompt
person
and
as
she
spoke
looked
at
the
clock
a
little
after
four
and
laid
the
paper
down
i
drive
you
to
the
station
daddy
and
telegraph
to
the
shipping
people
and
his
doctor
friend
we
get
authentic
information
somehow
if
we
have
to
cable
home
for
it
they
were
off
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
having
sent
a
message
to
mary
by
miss
keene
to
explain
their
errand
they
dined
in
the
township
while
waiting
for
replies
and
came
home
late
at
night
with
the
melancholy
news
confirmed
since
it
happened
to
be
the
transition
moment
when
mr
carey
had
ceased
to
be
a
mate
and
was
only
a
prospective
commander
the
authorities
in
melbourne
consulting
latest
advices
had
no
doubt
of
his
having
been
on
the
dovedale
to
the
last
those
of
them
who
presently
found
themselves
mistaken
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
say
so
they
left
it
to
time
and
the
newspapers
but
meanwhile
mary
pennycuick
sadly
complicated
the
case
when
deb
and
her
father
returned
from
their
expedition
it
was
to
hear
from
frances
an
excited
story
of
how
the
elder
sister
had
hidden
behind
locked
doors
and
not
only
refused
dinner
but
denied
speech
to
all
comers
we
know
she
there
because
she
said
away
to
miss
keene
when
she
knocked
first
but
since
then
she
has
said
a
word
not
for
hours
and
hours
i
been
listening
at
her
door
since
miss
madden
let
me
out
of
school
i
should
be
surprised
said
frances
who
had
a
fine
imagination
if
she
committed
suicide
poor
mr
carey
was
her
lover
you
know
pooh
said
deb
she
knew
whose
lover
poor
mr
carey
had
been
but
she
ran
to
mary
room
in
some
concern
she
tried
the
handle
of
the
door
and
then
rapped
sharply
molly
open
this
door
she
commanded
and
there
was
a
rustle
inside
a
shuffling
step
and
the
lock
clicked
she
marched
in
to
see
mary
fling
herself
back
on
the
bed
from
which
she
had
risen
with
a
protesting
wail
oh
why
ca
you
all
let
me
alone
why
what
the
matter
deb
climbed
on
the
bed
and
tried
to
lift
the
head
to
her
breast
a
signal
for
the
grief
to
burst
forth
molly
sweetheart
what
all
this
about
oh
my
love
my
love
keened
mary
wildly
oh
deb
oh
deb
he
was
my
all
and
he
dead
and
i
ca
bear
it
i
ca
i
ca
deb
pursed
her
lips
and
the
colour
rose
in
her
clear
cheek
she
saw
the
situation
so
pathetic
and
so
ignominious
she
could
not
understand
a
woman
falling
in
love
with
and
then
breaking
her
heart
for
a
man
who
had
never
cared
for
her
but
then
deb
face
was
not
heavy
and
bricky
with
prominent
and
a
forehead
four
inches
high
my
precious
she
crooned
as
tenderly
as
if
she
understood
it
all
and
as
if
her
immense
pity
was
not
mixed
with
contempt
do
do
it
does
matter
about
me
but
do
let
the
others
think
it
would
be
too
undignified
darling
a
casual
acquaintance
though
a
dear
good
boy
as
ever
lived
there
was
nobody
like
him
deb
and
he
was
my
all
no
no
mary
you
do
know
debbie
oh
nobody
knows
and
wrapping
her
head
in
her
arms
again
mary
abandoned
herself
to
her
despair
deb
got
off
the
bed
lit
candles
and
poured
water
and
eau
de
cologne
into
a
she
returned
with
a
fragrant
sponge
with
which
she
stroked
what
she
could
reach
of
her
sister
face
come
now
said
she
briskly
you
must
have
a
little
pride
dear
you
must
give
way
like
this
for
a
man
who
did
not
and
you
know
he
did
not
mary
broke
in
with
sudden
passion
lifting
her
distorted
countenance
to
the
cruel
light
he
did
she
affirmed
you
have
no
business
to
sneer
and
say
he
did
he
did
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
the
girl
had
brooded
for
months
over
a
few
acts
and
words
magnifying
them
through
the
spectacles
that
nature
and
her
needs
had
provided
deb
put
her
pitying
arms
round
her
sister
shoulders
but
my
dear
i
know
we
all
know
how
could
you
know
when
you
were
not
at
home
nobody
knows
nobody
but
him
and
me
feeling
deb
continued
scepticism
in
the
silence
of
her
caresses
mary
burst
out
recklessly
would
he
have
kissed
me
if
he
had
not
deb
arm
was
withdrawn
she
twisted
half
round
to
look
in
mary
face
mary
covered
it
with
her
pretty
hands
weeping
bitterly
is
that
did
he
do
that
asked
deb
in
a
low
tone
that
night
that
last
night
oh
i
ought
not
to
have
spoken
of
it
when
we
were
at
our
little
grave
it
was
that
precious
child
that
drew
us
together
you
think
he
had
gone
away
and
forgotten
but
i
know
he
had
not
he
would
have
come
back
he
promised
to
he
gave
me
his
dear
photograph
i
have
not
shown
it
to
anybody
but
here
it
is
and
still
sobbing
and
with
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
she
reached
to
a
drawer
by
the
bedside
and
dragged
out
this
further
testimony
to
her
claim
it
was
wrapped
in
layers
of
like
her
valentine
and
displayed
it
with
a
touching
pride
before
handing
it
to
deb
she
gazed
at
it
with
grotesquely
distorted
face
kissed
it
pressed
it
to
her
bosom
kissed
it
again
and
moaned
over
it
rocking
to
and
fro
then
when
she
had
pushed
it
from
her
flung
herself
into
her
former
attitude
of
complete
abandonment
to
grief
very
calmly
deb
carried
the
picture
to
the
and
held
it
behind
a
candle
there
he
was
big
strong
healthy
manly
with
that
clear
brow
that
square
chin
that
steady
good
mouth
and
he
looked
her
straight
in
the
eyes
was
it
possible
that
a
countenance
could
so
deceive
no
more
tears
from
deb
for
his
untimely
fate
had
it
been
his
face
in
the
flesh
it
could
not
possibly
have
gazed
in
that
undaunted
way
at
hers
her
expression
would
have
withered
him
she
returned
to
the
also
when
no
guests
were
in
the
house
to
report
to
her
father
mary
has
gone
to
bed
she
said
quietly
she
is
very
much
upset
by
this
business
it
appears
there
was
something
between
her
and
mr
carey
she
expected
him
to
come
back
for
her
what
mary
cried
rose
waiting
with
frances
to
say
goodnight
there
triumphed
frances
what
did
i
say
mary
their
father
echoed
rose
surprised
tone
the
dickens
you
do
say
so
poor
little
soul
poor
little
girlie
well
i
never
thought
of
that
did
you
deb
never
father
not
for
a
moment
i
suppose
it
was
the
child
it
must
have
been
the
child
mr
pennycuick
was
deeply
concerned
i
wonder
why
he
never
said
anything
he
addressed
deb
when
rose
and
frances
had
been
sent
to
bed
eh
deb
seems
strange
do
it
we
had
so
much
talk
together
quite
like
a
sort
of
son
he
was
aye
i
could
have
made
a
son
of
that
fellow
poor
lad
poor
lad
suppose
he
thought
it
was
the
straight
thing
to
bind
a
girl
of
ours
till
he
was
in
a
better
position
it
be
just
like
him
well
but
mary
of
all
people
this
was
the
puzzle
to
all
it
must
have
been
the
baby
she
certainly
did
dote
on
that
child
and
me
love
my
dog
eh
but
to
think
of
her
keeping
it
so
close
all
that
time
afraid
i
make
a
fuss
i
suppose
you
could
have
told
her
deb
that
i
do
stand
in
my
children
way
for
the
sake
of
my
own
feelings
and
a
carey
of
wellwood
is
for
us
to
sniff
at
either
if
he
is
poor
a
carey
has
been
good
enough
for
a
pennycuick
before
today
god
i
wish
i
known
i
might
have
got
him
something
better
to
do
and
saved
them
both
from
this
poor
old
girl
is
she
very
bad
debbie
shall
i
go
and
talk
to
her
a
bit
i
would
tonight
father
if
i
were
you
replied
deb
with
a
weary
air
she
is
quieter
now
and
i
have
given
her
something
to
send
her
to
sleep
i
will
keep
my
door
open
and
go
and
look
at
her
through
the
night
i
think
she
will
be
better
tomorrow
on
the
morrow
mary
was
at
least
more
she
came
amongst
her
family
with
the
look
of
one
who
had
passed
through
an
illness
and
shrinking
from
the
first
words
and
glances
but
they
all
gathered
her
to
their
hearts
and
murmured
loving
sympathy
in
her
ears
and
tenderly
fussed
over
her
and
waited
upon
her
her
father
took
her
to
his
sanctum
and
showed
her
his
old
daguerreotype
and
valentine
and
told
her
they
should
be
hers
at
his
death
miss
keene
excited
as
an
old
maid
is
over
anybody
love
affair
wanted
to
take
over
the
as
well
as
the
doing
of
the
flowers
in
order
to
leave
the
mourner
free
to
enjoy
the
full
luxury
of
her
state
the
governess
assumed
to
be
above
love
affairs
was
very
strict
with
frances
holding
her
to
tasks
set
on
purpose
to
prevent
her
from
teasing
her
eldest
sister
but
frances
had
informed
the
servants
overnight
that
mr
carey
was
drowned
and
that
he
had
been
miss
pennycuick
affianced
husband
all
the
time
unbeknown
to
anybody
and
the
tale
was
already
spreading
far
and
wide
to
the
urquharts
at
five
creeks
to
mr
thornycroft
at
bundaboo
to
mr
goldsworthy
and
his
parishioners
to
the
editor
of
the
local
paper
so
that
soon
the
family
friends
were
arriving
to
press
mary
hand
and
condole
with
her
to
show
her
how
she
had
risen
in
the
world
as
a
woman
in
the
eyes
of
all
no
no
she
protested
when
the
affianced
husband
was
too
literally
taken
for
granted
it
was
not
a
formal
engagement
it
was
only
defending
herself
against
the
puzzled
stare
and
lifted
eyebrow
only
that
we
understood
each
other
he
was
coming
back
if
he
had
lived
the
wish
was
father
to
the
thought
good
honest
girl
as
she
was
she
had
persuaded
herself
to
this
that
he
would
have
come
back
if
he
had
lived
and
that
then
the
omitted
formalities
called
for
by
that
graveside
kiss
would
certainly
have
been
observed
it
seems
incredible
but
rampant
sex
does
stranger
things
every
day
of
the
week
there
is
at
any
rate
nothing
extraordinary
in
the
way
she
clung
to
the
sweet
dignity
that
a
similar
belief
on
the
part
of
others
brought
to
her
the
poor
plain
girl
who
had
always
been
out
of
it
the
photograph
was
now
put
into
a
costly
frame
and
set
up
in
her
room
for
anybody
to
see
frances
would
often
sneak
in
with
a
visitor
to
show
the
manner
of
man
who
would
have
married
molly
there
were
even
times
when
mary
herself
was
the
exhibitor
at
other
times
she
might
have
been
found
kneeling
before
it
as
at
a
shrine
and
weeping
her
eyes
out
and
she
put
off
her
colours
and
ornaments
and
wore
black
and
nobody
made
any
objection
the
hero
of
romance
was
given
to
her
unquestioningly
and
with
him
a
respect
and
consideration
such
as
she
had
never
known
before
lovers
talked
to
her
of
their
love
affairs
feeling
that
she
was
now
one
of
them
her
father
maundered
to
her
for
hours
at
a
stretch
of
the
old
mary
carey
at
last
secure
of
sympathy
and
a
perfect
listener
deb
was
reserved
and
silent
but
otherwise
as
devoted
as
the
rest
and
then
came
the
inevitable
discovery
that
guthrie
carey
was
not
dead
after
all
it
was
made
at
five
creeks
while
frances
was
on
a
holiday
visit
to
her
friend
belle
urquhart
at
redford
nobody
thought
of
reading
the
shipping
columns
in
the
newspaper
their
interest
was
supposed
to
be
gone
for
ever
but
jim
urquhart
glanced
at
them
daily
looking
for
the
arrival
of
a
friend
from
overseas
and
one
day
he
saw
a
ship
name
that
was
familiar
to
him
and
bracketed
with
it
the
name
of
carey
as
its
commander
the
coincidence
was
startling
he
pointed
it
out
to
a
man
staying
in
the
house
a
stranger
to
the
redford
family
and
to
the
district
there
was
a
mate
named
carey
on
this
ship
a
while
ago
he
changed
into
that
unfortunate
dovedale
that
was
wrecked
and
was
lost
with
her
odd
that
the
captain
of
his
old
vessel
should
have
the
same
name
same
initial
too
our
friend
was
guthrie
guthrie
carey
oh
i
know
guthrie
carey
met
him
in
london
last
year
just
after
the
dovedale
wreck
he
told
me
of
his
narrow
escape
was
really
going
with
her
on
her
last
voyage
and
only
prevented
at
the
last
moment
by
the
offer
of
this
captaincy
from
his
former
owners
the
same
man
do
you
know
him
they
all
told
how
much
they
knew
him
and
there
was
great
commotion
at
five
creeks
jim
was
for
driving
to
redford
to
warn
mr
pennycuick
against
disseminating
the
newspaper
through
the
house
too
rashly
alice
and
her
mother
each
volunteered
to
go
with
him
so
as
to
break
it
with
feminine
skilfulness
to
mary
whose
reason
might
be
destroyed
by
too
sudden
a
gorge
of
joy
like
the
stomach
of
a
starved
man
by
clumsy
feeding
but
while
they
anxiously
discussed
what
ought
to
be
done
frances
was
doing
the
enterprising
young
lady
slipped
away
and
with
belle
help
caught
and
saddled
her
pony
and
was
off
to
redford
as
if
wolves
were
at
her
heels
no
war
correspondent
on
active
service
ever
did
a
smarter
trick
to
get
ahead
of
other
papers
she
burst
into
the
family
circle
violently
mary
mary
deb
rose
father
mr
carey
is
alive
he
was
drowned
he
was
on
the
dovedale
he
was
just
going
but
they
wanted
him
back
and
they
made
him
a
captain
and
he
here
now
his
ship
came
in
last
night
and
there
it
is
in
the
paper
and
his
name
and
mr
mills
at
five
creeks
saw
him
himself
after
the
dovedale
was
wrecked
and
he
knows
him
well
and
he
in
melbourne
now
and
i
expect
he
be
here
directly
perhaps
he
coming
up
now
this
very
minute
she
was
checked
by
angry
exclamations
from
all
persons
addressed
except
mary
she
at
the
moment
bending
over
a
table
cutting
out
straightened
herself
and
stood
stockstill
and
staring
while
first
her
bricky
face
went
dark
purple
all
over
and
then
seemed
drained
in
three
seconds
of
every
drop
of
blood
she
heard
the
words
carey
is
alive
and
instantly
believed
them
at
the
same
moment
her
vanished
and
she
saw
the
bare
ground
of
her
love
affair
exactly
as
it
was
as
guthrie
himself
would
see
it
and
just
how
she
had
deceived
herself
and
others
her
healthy
heart
and
nervous
system
could
not
support
her
under
the
impact
of
such
a
shock
she
reeled
as
she
stood
spun
half
round
and
fell
backwards
into
arms
you
little
fool
deb
rated
the
dismayed
child
to
blurt
it
out
like
that
never
mind
father
it
all
right
she
has
fainted
but
soon
come
round
go
and
get
a
somebody
tell
keziah
to
bring
a
little
brandy
do
speak
to
anybody
else
where
argus
while
rose
was
flying
for
restoratives
and
frances
speeding
through
the
house
with
her
great
news
deb
and
her
father
exchanged
significant
glances
over
mary
prostrate
form
it
is
more
than
a
year
said
deb
and
he
has
not
even
written
to
her
i
write
to
him
said
mr
pennycuick
grinding
his
teeth
write
to
him
it
was
the
tone
in
which
he
might
have
said
i
wring
his
neck
for
him
but
when
mary
came
round
and
perceived
his
mood
and
intentions
she
implored
him
not
to
write
went
on
her
knees
and
almost
shrieked
in
her
frantic
fear
of
his
doing
so
oh
father
do
do
if
he
does
not
remember
if
he
does
not
want
to
come
you
would
not
drag
him
by
force
and
he
never
bound
himself
he
never
really
asked
me
very
likely
he
did
not
mean
anything
after
all
not
mean
anything
shouted
the
indignant
father
he
can
kiss
a
girl
a
daughter
of
mine
and
not
mean
anything
i
make
him
tell
me
whether
he
dared
not
to
mean
anything
no
father
commanded
deb
you
must
not
write
to
him
it
is
not
for
a
pennycuick
to
fling
herself
at
any
man
head
let
him
alone
we
do
want
him
treat
him
as
i
hope
molly
is
going
to
do
with
the
contempt
that
he
deserves
mr
pennycuick
stormed
and
muttered
but
obeyed
and
for
two
days
captain
carey
was
left
to
the
anathemas
of
redford
and
the
countryside
as
a
heartless
jilt
to
mary
extreme
anguish
she
tried
to
water
down
the
concoction
that
she
stood
answerable
for
to
take
blame
off
him
and
put
it
on
herself
but
she
dared
not
go
far
enough
to
convince
anybody
that
she
was
not
sacrificing
herself
to
shield
him
it
was
a
horrible
position
for
a
and
even
girl
and
the
misery
of
it
was
aggravated
by
the
constant
effort
to
efface
its
signs
and
evidences
she
was
left
with
no
outlook
in
life
but
to
get
through
twenty
thirty
forty
years
somehow
and
come
to
a
little
peace
at
last
when
everything
would
be
forgotten
and
her
one
forlorn
hope
was
that
guthrie
would
not
discover
her
crime
would
keep
up
the
neglect
with
which
he
had
treated
his
old
friends
and
not
come
near
them
he
might
have
done
this
for
the
fact
was
that
he
now
had
a
dawning
affair
in
another
quarter
had
not
frances
intervened
to
her
inaction
at
such
a
crisis
was
intolerable
and
since
nobody
else
would
do
it
she
wrote
to
guthrie
carey
herself
she
wrote
she
said
to
welcome
him
back
to
life
and
to
australia
and
to
congratulate
him
on
being
a
captain
incidentally
she
mentioned
other
matters
and
asked
questions
which
she
was
well
aware
could
only
be
answered
in
person
frances
since
his
first
acquaintance
with
her
had
shot
up
into
a
slim
tall
girl
exquisite
in
colouring
and
the
daintiness
of
her
figure
and
face
although
unlike
deb
in
every
way
people
were
beginning
to
compare
them
as
rival
beauties
frances
private
opinion
being
that
there
was
no
comparison
she
had
nearly
done
with
governesses
short
frocks
and
pigtails
and
was
ardently
anticipating
the
power
and
glory
coming
to
her
when
she
should
be
a
woman
two
days
after
the
clandestine
postage
of
her
letter
to
captain
carey
a
new
housemaid
brought
mary
his
on
a
silver
tray
mary
knew
before
looking
at
it
having
heard
nothing
of
the
letter
and
no
sound
of
his
arrival
in
his
hired
buggy
what
name
it
bore
her
forlorn
hope
had
been
too
forlorn
to
stand
for
anything
but
despair
she
had
expected
the
catastrophe
from
the
first
chapter
x
how
she
got
into
the
room
the
isolated
big
which
somebody
else
who
was
aware
of
his
arrival
had
directed
that
he
was
to
be
shown
into
mary
knew
not
but
she
was
there
he
stood
perfectly
still
massive
and
inflexible
to
receive
her
without
approaching
him
or
he
her
to
shake
hands
without
looking
at
his
face
or
anywhere
near
it
she
perceived
the
adamantine
set
of
lips
the
cold
gaze
more
withering
than
fire
which
informed
her
that
he
knew
all
and
she
sank
crouching
into
a
chair
and
hid
her
face
but
her
back
was
against
the
wall
now
the
coward
stage
was
past
in
the
most
desperately
false
position
that
a
girl
could
occupy
she
made
no
further
attempt
to
run
away
from
the
truth
perhaps
because
she
saw
that
it
was
useless
when
he
began
very
politely
but
with
no
beating
about
the
bush
to
say
i
daresay
you
are
surprised
to
see
me
miss
pennycuick
but
i
was
told
and
since
i
came
up
here
i
have
been
told
again
by
several
different
persons
something
that
i
want
you
to
help
me
to
understand
she
jerked
herself
upright
and
stopped
him
with
a
swift
gesture
and
the
cry
of
i
know
i
know
what
you
have
been
told
and
i
have
nothing
to
say
i
can
not
contradict
it
she
was
a
piteous
object
in
her
shaking
anguish
but
he
looked
at
her
of
course
without
a
scrap
of
pity
do
you
think
you
really
know
he
questioned
her
with
cold
gravity
perhaps
i
have
been
given
an
exaggerated
version
i
was
in
hopes
that
it
was
altogether
an
invention
of
miss
francie
i
know
of
old
that
she
is
prone
to
make
reckless
statements
francie
she
was
kind
enough
to
write
me
a
long
letter
to
congratulate
me
on
my
promotion
she
told
me
all
the
family
news
and
she
said
she
asked
me
but
really
i
have
the
cheek
to
repeat
her
words
his
cold
face
had
become
hot
and
his
manner
agitated
go
on
said
she
calming
under
the
perception
that
the
worst
had
come
utterly
to
the
worst
well
if
you
will
forgive
me
she
asked
me
in
effect
when
i
was
coming
to
marry
you
and
why
i
had
kept
the
engagement
a
secret
so
long
he
paused
one
dark
red
blush
to
note
the
effect
of
so
brutal
a
stroke
she
said
meeting
his
eyes
for
the
first
time
and
you
believed
it
at
once
of
me
no
miss
pennycuick
i
laughed
i
said
to
myself
is
another
of
miss
francie
mare
nests
but
when
i
read
on
she
told
me
so
many
things
they
were
incredible
but
still
i
felt
i
had
to
sift
the
matter
and
since
i
came
up
today
other
people
i
been
to
five
creeks
and
had
a
talk
with
jim
urquhart
now
i
do
know
what
to
think
at
least
there
is
but
one
thing
that
i
can
think
the
chair
she
had
taken
had
a
high
back
and
against
this
she
laid
her
head
as
if
too
weary
to
support
it
lack
of
sleep
and
appetite
had
paled
her
florid
colour
to
a
sickly
hue
and
she
looked
wan
and
languid
as
a
dying
woman
but
still
he
did
not
pity
her
as
he
must
have
done
had
her
face
been
half
as
beautiful
as
deb
or
francie
miss
pennycuick
he
continued
as
she
kept
silence
i
want
to
get
the
hang
of
this
thing
will
you
tell
me
straight
yes
or
no
have
you
been
giving
it
out
that
i
left
redford
two
years
ago
engaged
to
you
her
first
impulse
was
to
cry
out
oh
no
no
not
quite
so
bad
as
that
but
on
second
thoughts
she
said
yes
practically
sudden
rage
seemed
to
seize
him
he
sat
up
he
crossed
his
knees
he
uncrossed
them
he
twisted
this
way
and
that
he
muttered
good
god
as
if
the
pious
ejaculation
had
referred
to
the
other
person
and
his
stare
at
her
was
cruel
but
but
i
have
been
racking
my
brains
to
remember
anything
surely
i
never
gave
you
i
am
perfectly
convinced
i
have
the
best
reason
for
being
absolutely
certain
that
i
could
not
have
given
you
never
she
broke
in
of
course
not
it
was
all
my
own
invention
you
admit
it
thank
you
you
formally
relieve
me
of
the
imputation
i
have
so
long
lain
under
without
knowing
it
of
having
run
away
from
my
duty
she
said
lifelessly
we
thought
you
were
dead
hah
i
see
you
thought
it
did
matter
what
you
said
of
a
dead
man
but
dead
men
characters
should
be
all
the
more
sacred
because
they
can
not
defend
them
i
should
be
sorry
indeed
to
leave
behind
me
such
a
reputation
as
i
seem
to
have
hereabouts
though
indeed
a
man
is
very
helpless
in
these
cases
he
is
at
a
hopeless
disadvantage
when
a
woman
is
his
traducer
i
can
see
that
jim
urquhart
will
never
be
a
friend
of
mine
again
whatever
happens
he
shall
know
the
truth
everybody
shall
know
the
truth
said
mary
how
can
everybody
know
the
truth
only
by
my
own
affidavit
and
that
would
not
be
believed
besides
it
is
not
for
me
to
deny
at
the
cost
of
branding
a
lady
a
liar
it
was
the
straight
word
regardless
of
manners
with
this
man
you
need
not
i
know
how
to
do
it
so
that
people
will
believe
i
am
going
to
write
a
letter
to
the
newspaper
a
plain
statement
that
will
fully
exonerate
you
he
nearly
jumped
out
of
his
chair
with
the
fright
she
gave
him
you
will
do
nothing
so
ridiculous
he
exclaimed
angrily
it
is
the
only
way
said
she
the
only
way
to
make
sure
if
you
do
he
menaced
her
i
shall
simply
write
another
for
the
next
issue
to
flatly
contradict
you
then
you
would
be
a
liar
that
does
matter
in
the
least
i
must
be
a
man
first
i
am
not
going
to
let
you
ruin
yourself
ah
that
is
done
already
nothing
can
make
it
worse
for
me
he
looked
at
her
taking
in
the
words
in
some
sort
understanding
them
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
look
at
him
and
what
he
saw
behind
the
look
went
to
his
kindly
heart
he
felt
for
her
for
the
first
time
may
i
go
now
she
whispered
his
answer
was
to
move
to
a
seat
beside
her
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
he
said
in
more
humane
tones
how
you
came
to
do
it
i
would
like
to
understand
and
i
ca
for
the
life
of
me
you
must
have
had
some
reason
did
i
do
anything
unknowing
she
shook
her
head
hopelessly
no
you
were
only
kind
and
good
as
you
would
have
been
to
anyone
kind
and
good
rubbish
it
was
you
all
of
you
who
were
kind
and
good
oh
i
do
forget
what
you
did
for
me
and
never
shall
i
feel
it
was
the
very
feeling
that
had
so
oppressed
him
in
the
case
of
the
lady
at
sandridge
under
a
load
of
obligation
to
you
that
i
can
never
hope
to
discharge
but
still
but
still
though
i
trust
i
showed
some
of
the
gratitude
i
felt
i
can
not
remember
how
i
came
to
give
you
the
idea
i
must
have
done
something
i
suppose
one
is
a
blundering
fool
without
knowing
it
no
she
protested
no
no
it
was
my
own
idea
entirely
but
i
ca
reconcile
that
with
your
character
miss
pennycuick
nor
can
i
she
laughed
bitterly
there
a
mystery
somewhere
did
anybody
tell
you
anything
did
miss
frances
put
constructions
on
innocent
appearances
did
no
mary
resolutely
stopped
him
it
is
good
of
you
to
try
to
make
excuses
but
there
is
no
excuse
for
me
none
francie
only
said
what
she
knew
i
let
them
believe
you
were
my
lover
i
am
i
never
had
one
and
and
oh
i
thought
that
at
least
you
might
be
mine
when
you
were
dead
i
did
not
mean
to
be
a
liar
as
you
called
me
yes
that
is
the
right
word
forgive
me
for
using
it
he
muttered
you
do
not
realise
at
first
that
you
are
lying
when
you
only
act
lies
and
do
speak
them
and
i
did
think
that
perhaps
that
possibly
of
course
i
was
ridiculously
wrong
it
was
atrocious
unforgivable
i
do
ask
you
to
forgive
me
i
do
want
you
to
but
those
dear
days
when
our
little
boy
oh
you
know
and
when
you
kissed
me
that
night
beside
his
grave
what
a
lightning
change
came
over
the
young
man
as
if
the
word
had
been
an
electric
current
suddenly
shot
into
him
kissed
you
it
was
nothing
you
did
not
know
you
did
it
but
here
hold
on
this
is
serious
did
i
kiss
you
you
are
sure
you
are
not
dreaming
i
would
not
be
very
likely
to
dream
that
she
said
with
a
strange
smile
but
of
course
it
was
only
at
such
a
time
as
you
would
have
kissed
your
sister
anybody
your
very
forgetting
it
shows
that
but
a
dim
memory
was
awakening
in
him
frightfully
perturbing
to
his
mind
i
kissed
you
he
repeated
and
slowly
realised
that
he
had
been
that
consummate
ass
the
poor
baby
dead
hand
had
retained
its
old
power
to
entrap
a
simpleton
unawares
well
simpleton
or
not
guthrie
carey
was
guthrie
carey
accustomed
to
meet
vital
emergencies
with
boldness
and
promptness
accustomed
also
to
take
his
own
views
of
what
was
a
man
part
at
such
times
while
she
implored
him
to
say
no
more
about
that
kiss
crying
shame
upon
herself
for
mentioning
it
he
sat
in
silence
thinking
hard
as
soon
as
she
had
done
he
spoke
miss
pennycuick
i
now
understand
everything
you
are
completely
justified
it
is
i
who
have
been
to
blame
and
he
then
in
precise
language
such
as
no
real
lover
could
have
used
but
still
as
prettily
as
was
possible
under
the
circumstances
requested
the
honour
of
her
hand
in
marriage
to
his
astonishment
she
laughed
it
was
a
cackle
and
quickly
turned
into
a
wail
she
faced
him
again
head
up
and
hands
down
that
mr
carey
is
the
one
way
out
of
it
that
is
utterly
absolutely
eternally
impossible
why
he
demanded
with
his
man
dull
incomprehension
and
went
on
to
demonstrate
that
there
was
no
other
i
do
not
wish
he
lied
chivalrously
to
take
any
other
i
i
believe
me
i
am
not
ungrateful
for
your
for
your
thinking
a
great
deal
more
of
me
than
i
deserve
i
will
try
to
show
myself
worthy
a
magnanimous
arm
attempted
to
encircle
her
she
backed
from
it
and
rose
hurriedly
from
her
chair
with
what
he
would
have
imagined
a
gesture
of
repulsion
if
he
had
not
known
her
from
her
own
showing
so
for
his
embraces
he
rose
too
do
not
she
cried
breathlessly
passionately
as
if
i
could
dream
what
can
you
think
of
me
to
imagine
that
i
would
for
a
moment
she
broke
from
him
and
ran
towards
the
door
sobbing
with
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
in
three
strides
he
was
there
before
her
cutting
off
her
retreat
so
she
swung
back
into
the
room
cast
herself
on
the
floor
beside
a
sofa
and
throwing
up
her
arms
plunged
her
head
down
between
them
into
the
depths
of
a
large
cushion
which
smothered
cries
that
would
otherwise
have
been
shrieks
she
abandoned
all
effort
to
control
herself
except
the
effort
to
hide
which
was
futile
guthrie
carey
first
feeling
was
of
alarm
lest
anyone
should
hear
and
come
in
to
see
what
was
the
matter
he
felt
like
wanting
to
guard
the
door
but
in
a
minute
or
two
his
soft
heart
was
so
worked
upon
by
the
spectacle
before
him
that
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
however
little
he
might
want
to
marry
mary
pennycuick
he
was
not
going
to
be
answerable
for
this
sort
of
thing
so
he
marched
resolutely
to
the
sofa
and
stooped
to
lift
the
convulsed
creature
bodily
into
his
arms
he
might
as
well
have
tried
to
grasp
a
sleeping
porcupine
how
dare
you
she
cried
shrilly
whirling
to
her
feet
dilating
like
a
hooded
snake
before
his
astonished
eyes
how
dare
you
touch
me
he
was
too
cowed
to
answer
and
she
stood
a
moment
all
fire
and
fury
glaring
at
him
her
face
distorted
her
hands
clenched
then
she
whirled
out
of
the
room
and
this
time
he
made
no
effort
to
stop
her
he
dropped
back
on
the
sofa
and
said
to
himself
helplessly
well
i
blowed
there
was
stillness
for
some
time
this
part
of
the
house
seemed
quite
empty
save
for
one
buzzing
fly
which
he
or
mary
had
let
in
the
little
housekeeper
was
very
particular
about
flies
in
summer
every
window
and
being
every
door
labelled
with
a
printed
request
to
the
user
to
shut
it
and
his
dazed
mind
occupied
itself
with
the
idea
of
how
this
insect
would
have
distressed
her
if
she
had
not
had
so
much
else
to
think
of
he
had
an
impulse
to
hunt
it
for
her
sake
through
the
space
in
which
it
careered
in
long
tacks
with
such
energy
and
noise
but
standing
up
he
was
seized
with
a
stronger
impulse
to
leave
the
house
forthwith
and
everything
in
it
he
wanted
liberty
to
consider
his
position
and
further
proceedings
before
he
faced
the
family
as
he
approached
the
door
it
was
opened
from
without
deb
stood
on
the
threshold
pale
proud
with
tight
lips
and
sombre
eyes
she
bowed
to
him
as
only
she
could
bow
to
a
person
she
was
offended
with
would
you
kindly
see
my
father
in
his
office
mr
carey
she
inquired
with
stony
formality
he
wishes
to
speak
to
you
certainly
miss
deborah
he
replied
not
daring
to
preface
the
words
with
even
a
i
want
to
see
him
i
want
to
see
him
particularly
deb
swept
round
to
lead
the
way
downstairs
an
embarrassing
march
it
was
tandem
fashion
through
the
long
passages
of
the
rambling
house
while
trying
to
arrange
his
thoughts
for
the
coming
interview
captain
carey
studied
her
imperious
back
and
shoulders
the
haughty
poise
of
her
head
and
though
he
was
not
the
one
that
had
behaved
badly
he
had
never
felt
so
small
at
the
door
of
the
she
dismissed
him
with
a
jerk
of
the
hand
you
know
your
way
said
she
and
vanished
she
is
more
beautiful
than
ever
was
his
poignant
thought
as
he
walked
away
from
her
and
from
all
the
glorious
life
that
she
suggested
to
such
a
dull
and
common
doom
mr
pennycuick
at
first
was
a
terrible
figure
struggling
between
his
and
his
instincts
of
courtesy
to
a
guest
sir
said
he
i
am
sorry
that
i
have
to
speak
to
you
under
my
own
roof
in
another
place
i
could
better
have
expressed
what
i
have
to
say
but
before
he
could
get
to
the
gist
of
the
matter
mary
intervened
miss
keene
has
some
refreshment
for
mr
carey
in
the
she
said
and
father
i
want
if
you
please
to
have
a
word
with
you
first
she
had
recovered
and
wore
a
rigid
determined
air
contrasting
with
the
sailor
bewilderment
which
was
so
great
that
he
found
himself
driven
from
the
office
before
he
had
made
up
his
mind
whether
he
ought
to
go
or
stay
he
sat
down
to
his
unnecessary
meal
and
tried
to
eat
while
an
embarrassed
maiden
lady
talked
platitudes
to
him
did
he
find
it
very
dusty
in
town
miss
keene
knitting
feverishly
was
anxious
to
be
informed
and
did
he
think
the
country
looked
well
for
the
time
of
year
he
was
relieved
from
this
tedium
by
another
summons
to
the
office
fortified
with
a
glass
of
good
wine
he
returned
to
the
encounter
inwardly
calling
upon
his
gods
to
direct
him
how
to
meet
it
he
found
poor
old
father
pennycuick
aged
ten
years
in
the
hour
since
he
had
seen
him
last
but
he
still
stood
in
massive
dignity
a
true
son
of
his
old
race
well
mr
carey
said
he
i
have
had
a
great
many
troubles
of
late
sir
but
never
one
like
this
i
thought
that
losing
money
the
fruits
of
a
lifetime
of
hard
work
was
a
thing
to
fret
over
and
then
again
i
thought
that
money
no
consequence
so
long
as
you
got
your
children
alive
and
well
that
that
was
everything
i
know
better
now
i
know
there
things
may
happen
to
a
man
worse
than
death
worse
than
losing
everything
belonging
to
him
no
matter
what
it
is
when
that
child
was
a
little
thing
she
had
an
illness
and
the
doctors
gave
her
up
two
nights
her
mother
and
i
sat
up
watching
her
expecting
every
breath
to
be
the
last
and
was
no
word
for
what
we
felt
i
cried
like
a
calf
and
i
prayed
i
never
prayed
like
it
before
or
since
and
fools
we
are
to
ask
the
almighty
for
we
do
know
what
now
i
wish
he
had
taken
her
and
i
told
her
so
then
you
have
been
very
cruel
mr
pennycuick
guthrie
carey
replied
sharply
and
as
unjust
as
cruel
she
has
done
nothing
i
know
what
she
done
the
stern
parent
interposed
i
would
have
believed
it
if
anybody
else
had
told
me
but
i
have
her
own
word
for
it
and
if
she
has
been
a
liar
once
i
still
know
when
to
believe
her
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
what
she
has
said
then
i
will
make
my
statement
the
old
man
put
up
his
hand
do
perjure
yourself
said
he
grimly
smiling
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
try
to
let
us
down
easily
but
you
can
spare
your
breath
excuses
only
make
it
worse
there
nothing
to
be
said
for
her
and
you
really
oblige
me
by
not
going
into
details
i
only
sent
for
you
to
make
such
amends
as
i
can
to
apologise
most
humbly
to
express
my
sorrow
my
shame
my
unspeakable
humiliation
that
a
child
of
mine
a
pennycuick
a
girl
i
thought
was
nothing
if
not
maidenly
and
and
the
very
soul
of
honour
and
straightness
and
proper
pride
you
speak
as
if
she
was
not
all
that
now
now
and
done
a
low
contemptible
thing
like
that
oh
i
understand
it
i
ca
it
too
monstrous
except
that
i
have
her
word
for
it
she
says
she
did
it
and
so
there
it
is
and
sir
i
beg
your
pardon
on
behalf
of
the
house
that
she
has
disgraced
the
house
that
reared
her
and
thought
her
so
different
he
gulped
coughed
and
gave
guthrie
a
chance
to
put
in
a
word
mr
pennycuick
the
simple
fact
is
that
i
made
love
to
your
daughter
made
her
an
offer
of
marriage
snarled
the
other
wheeling
round
i
kissed
her
mr
pennycuick
snapped
his
thumb
and
finger
derisively
that
kind
of
kiss
as
good
as
asked
for
it
was
not
as
good
as
asked
for
your
daughter
is
not
that
kind
of
woman
i
thought
not
but
she
says
she
is
pay
no
heed
to
what
she
says
her
morbid
conscientiousness
runs
away
with
her
i
tell
you
the
plain
truth
as
man
to
man
without
any
hysterics
i
kissed
her
of
my
own
free
will
your
daughter
sir
and
i
am
here
now
to
stand
by
my
act
if
she
will
forgive
my
my
tardiness
as
you
know
i
was
in
no
position
then
to
aspire
to
marriage
with
a
lady
of
this
family
i
am
not
now
but
i
am
better
off
than
i
was
will
you
give
your
consent
to
our
engagement
no
roared
mr
pennycuick
looking
as
if
threatened
with
an
apoplectic
fit
i
see
her
engaged
to
the
devil
first
like
mary
he
seemed
to
take
the
generous
offer
as
a
personal
insult
guthrie
carey
conscious
of
doing
the
duty
of
a
gentleman
at
enormous
cost
could
not
understand
why
chapter
xi
captain
carey
while
leaving
it
to
be
understood
that
he
held
himself
engaged
to
mary
pennycuick
until
further
orders
realised
the
welcome
fact
that
in
the
meantime
he
was
honourably
free
and
he
excused
himself
from
staying
to
dinner
but
scarcely
had
he
driven
off
in
his
hired
buggy
than
that
of
mr
goldsworthy
clattered
into
the
stableyard
it
was
the
good
man
habit
when
on
his
parochial
visitations
to
redford
at
meal
times
or
at
whenever
distances
allowed
he
called
it
most
appropriately
his
second
home
and
walked
into
the
house
as
if
it
really
belonged
to
him
two
or
three
times
a
week
the
first
person
that
he
encountered
on
this
occasion
was
frances
who
had
waylaid
guthrie
carey
on
his
departure
and
whom
he
had
left
standing
under
the
back
porch
aglow
with
excitement
she
was
a
picture
in
her
pale
blue
frock
put
on
for
his
eyes
and
with
her
mane
of
burnished
gold
falling
about
her
sparkling
face
but
the
parson
accustomed
to
regard
her
as
a
child
was
unaffected
by
the
sight
surely
he
exclaimed
with
agitation
that
was
young
mr
carey
that
i
passed
at
the
gate
just
now
he
had
his
hat
pulled
over
his
eyes
and
did
not
stop
to
speak
to
me
but
the
figure
was
his
said
frances
bursting
to
be
the
first
to
say
it
very
much
in
the
flesh
still
is
he
and
oh
to
think
he
gone
like
this
just
as
we
got
him
back
so
big
and
handsome
and
such
a
dear
as
he
would
have
made
she
stamped
her
foot
what
do
you
think
mr
goldsworthy
he
came
for
her
today
just
as
he
promised
and
then
she
turned
round
and
have
him
we
thought
he
jilted
her
and
instead
of
that
she
jilted
him
oh
i
could
smack
her
to
have
such
a
chance
she
and
after
all
the
fuss
she
made
about
him
and
throw
it
away
but
i
think
he
come
back
before
his
ship
sails
he
said
he
would
and
perhaps
she
be
less
of
an
idiot
by
then
she
better
unless
she
wants
to
die
an
old
maid
oh
if
it
was
me
mr
goldsworthy
penetrated
to
the
where
something
of
the
same
tale
was
repeated
to
him
yes
guthrie
carey
was
alive
and
well
and
had
been
up
to
see
them
yes
he
had
asked
for
mary
now
that
he
was
a
captain
but
she
had
finally
decided
against
marrying
a
sailor
wisely
perhaps
at
any
rate
it
was
her
business
the
family
did
not
wish
to
discuss
the
matter
when
mr
goldsworthy
found
that
mary
did
not
come
to
dinner
he
drew
some
conclusions
for
himself
he
told
himself
there
was
something
fishy
in
the
affair
something
behind
that
was
purposely
kept
from
him
but
he
was
hungry
and
the
fragrant
soup
steamed
under
his
nose
and
glittered
in
his
spoon
it
was
so
admirably
clear
just
now
the
doings
of
the
redford
cook
were
of
more
concern
to
him
than
doings
but
although
he
enjoyed
the
meal
to
which
he
had
looked
forward
all
day
he
enjoyed
it
much
less
than
usual
a
more
sensitive
person
in
his
place
must
have
found
it
wretched
deb
was
a
chilling
hostess
her
frigid
dignity
and
forced
politeness
caused
discomfort
even
to
him
thereby
lowering
her
status
in
his
eyes
lessening
the
ardour
of
his
admiration
for
her
mr
pennycuick
such
a
stickler
for
hospitality
scarcely
spoke
a
word
to
the
guest
rose
was
a
nobody
but
still
might
have
done
something
in
the
way
of
entertainment
and
she
quite
ignored
him
looking
down
as
if
to
hide
eyes
that
had
been
crying
frances
was
eager
to
engage
in
conversation
but
was
bidden
roughly
by
her
father
to
hold
her
tongue
the
stately
governess
wore
only
more
ostentatiously
than
usual
the
detached
air
that
always
marked
her
out
of
school
and
it
was
left
to
poor
miss
keene
with
her
timid
platitudes
to
keep
up
an
appearance
of
civility
mr
pennycuick
vanished
abruptly
after
dinner
it
was
presently
rumoured
that
he
was
not
well
and
had
gone
to
bed
frances
was
taken
away
to
prepare
lessons
rose
and
deborah
came
and
went
coffee
was
served
the
parson
was
again
left
to
miss
keene
who
would
not
be
pumped
for
confidences
further
than
to
admit
that
mary
was
keeping
her
room
with
a
headache
in
consequence
of
the
agitating
visit
of
captain
carey
but
laboriously
talked
parish
to
him
without
appearing
to
know
anything
of
the
subject
so
the
poor
man
actually
became
so
bored
that
he
changed
his
mind
about
staying
for
the
night
he
remembered
that
there
was
a
good
moon
and
that
he
had
an
early
engagement
next
morning
and
ordered
his
buggy
soon
after
nine
afterwards
he
believed
that
it
was
the
direct
voice
of
the
lord
that
had
called
him
to
take
his
journey
home
at
that
hour
he
drove
alone
having
a
steady
redford
mare
that
stood
quietly
at
gates
and
doors
and
no
groom
a
luxury
almost
unknown
amongst
country
parsons
who
must
all
keep
horses
the
night
was
beautiful
still
cool
and
clear
the
moon
so
full
that
he
could
see
for
miles
because
of
this
he
took
his
daylight
short
cuts
across
country
preferring
grass
when
he
could
get
it
to
the
dusty
summer
road
and
one
of
his
short
cuts
led
along
the
top
of
the
embankment
of
the
big
dam
he
slackened
speed
at
this
spot
touched
by
the
beauty
of
the
scene
which
could
hardly
have
appealed
in
vain
to
any
man
who
had
just
had
a
good
dinner
how
peacefully
the
still
water
lay
under
the
shining
moon
that
moon
which
is
capable
of
making
not
soft
young
lovers
only
but
the
toughest
old
stagers
sentimental
nay
maudlin
at
times
an
intoxicant
purged
of
the
grossness
of
spirituous
liquors
but
acting
on
the
brain
in
precisely
the
same
way
mr
goldsworthy
already
uplifted
by
good
redford
wine
felt
the
effect
of
the
lovely
night
in
dim
poetic
stirrings
of
his
sordid
little
soul
he
mused
of
god
and
heaven
and
the
other
things
that
he
made
sermons
out
of
in
a
disinterested
unprofessional
way
these
being
the
lines
along
which
his
imagination
worked
surely
the
lord
is
in
this
place
was
the
unspoken
thought
elevating
and
inspiring
with
which
he
surveyed
the
placid
lake
and
the
dreaming
hills
and
it
is
good
for
me
to
be
here
he
felt
even
at
the
cost
of
a
redford
bed
and
breakfast
and
the
choice
vegetables
that
the
gardener
would
have
put
into
his
buggy
in
the
morning
but
what
was
this
a
boat
adrift
from
out
of
the
shadow
of
the
white
shed
on
the
further
shore
a
black
spot
moved
one
of
the
boats
that
should
have
been
locked
up
since
no
one
was
allowed
to
use
them
without
mr
pennycuick
permission
it
came
into
the
open
moonlight
into
the
middle
of
that
silver
mirror
and
he
saw
that
oars
propelled
it
and
saw
the
figure
of
the
person
wielding
them
who
had
dared
to
take
this
liberty
with
sacred
redford
property
he
wondered
with
the
indignation
of
a
and
he
assumed
a
poacher
after
the
fish
that
mr
pennycuick
had
been
trying
with
characteristic
perseverance
and
unsuccess
to
naturalise
in
his
dam
but
looking
harder
the
clergyman
saw
the
figure
rise
in
the
boat
and
that
it
was
a
woman
almost
at
the
same
instant
he
saw
that
it
had
disappeared
seizing
whip
and
reins
he
lashed
his
mare
to
a
gallop
along
the
embankment
and
down
its
steep
side
where
she
nearly
upset
him
and
round
the
lake
shore
the
buggy
rocking
like
a
cradle
to
the
point
nearest
to
the
boat
now
visibly
adrift
and
empty
he
jumped
to
the
ground
tore
off
his
coat
and
vest
which
had
a
valuable
watch
attached
flinging
them
and
his
hat
and
presently
his
boots
into
the
buggy
and
with
a
word
of
warning
to
the
mare
he
plunged
into
the
water
to
the
rescue
of
some
poor
fool
whom
as
yet
he
had
not
identified
he
returned
to
shore
with
mary
pennycuick
in
his
arms
spent
and
panting
from
his
struggle
and
awed
by
the
tragical
significance
of
the
affair
his
heart
exulted
at
his
deed
he
thanked
god
that
he
had
been
in
time
with
a
fervour
proportionate
to
her
rank
and
consequence
and
anticipated
the
splendid
reward
awaiting
him
as
the
benefactor
of
the
great
family
entitled
to
their
full
confidence
and
eternal
gratitude
but
also
he
was
filled
with
solicitude
for
the
poor
girl
she
was
unconscious
when
he
laid
her
down
on
the
grass
but
choked
and
moaned
when
he
set
to
work
to
revive
her
and
realised
that
she
was
back
in
life
and
misery
after
he
had
succeeded
in
getting
some
whisky
down
her
throat
contents
of
the
flask
he
always
carried
as
a
preventive
of
chills
and
remedy
for
undue
fatigues
and
from
which
he
had
first
helped
himself
they
sat
upon
the
ground
side
by
side
his
arm
round
her
waist
her
head
feeling
only
that
it
was
cushioned
somewhere
on
his
shoulder
the
night
was
so
warm
and
windless
that
their
wet
clothes
were
little
discomfort
to
them
but
he
kept
grasping
and
wringing
handfuls
with
the
hand
at
liberty
while
he
supported
her
with
the
other
the
danger
of
damp
things
was
more
terrifying
to
him
now
than
the
danger
of
death
had
been
a
few
minutes
ago
there
there
he
said
soothingly
you
feel
better
now
do
you
then
i
just
put
on
my
coat
if
you
do
mind
i
wrap
you
up
in
the
buggy
rug
and
we
get
back
to
redford
as
soon
as
we
can
and
in
the
morning
dear
you
wake
up
sorry
for
this
this
madness
and
you
never
do
it
again
will
you
hysteria
he
said
to
himself
her
head
turned
by
this
love
affair
he
treated
her
badly
whatever
they
may
say
and
it
has
unhinged
her
mind
this
thought
disposed
him
to
be
gentle
with
her
when
she
positively
refused
to
be
taken
back
to
redford
leave
me
here
she
implored
him
i
can
not
go
home
i
will
not
go
home
my
father
told
me
he
wished
i
was
dead
oh
i
should
have
been
dead
now
if
you
had
left
me
alone
and
then
they
would
have
been
satisfied
and
i
should
have
been
out
of
my
misery
which
is
more
than
i
can
bear
oh
mr
goldsworthy
do
do
mad
as
a
hatter
poor
thing
he
thought
as
he
desisted
from
his
effort
to
raise
her
why
her
father
thinks
the
world
of
her
but
something
had
to
be
done
it
was
unwise
to
use
force
in
these
cases
nor
could
he
have
brought
himself
to
use
it
and
of
course
he
could
not
leave
her
at
the
dam
or
leave
her
at
all
while
she
was
in
her
present
mood
and
without
other
protection
at
the
same
time
it
was
imperatively
necessary
that
he
should
get
out
of
his
wet
clothes
her
also
he
mentioned
this
latter
fact
and
it
was
touching
to
see
her
own
careful
housewifely
instincts
assert
themselves
through
all
her
mental
agony
oh
you
are
wet
she
mourned
feeling
him
it
did
not
matter
about
herself
oh
i
am
so
sorry
do
do
go
home
at
once
and
take
them
off
and
have
something
hot
before
you
go
to
bed
i
will
he
said
if
you
will
go
with
me
a
moment
reflection
showed
him
that
this
was
the
best
course
to
take
her
to
his
own
house
and
send
a
message
to
mr
pennycuick
that
she
was
there
and
safe
the
thought
of
the
town
frightened
her
she
dreaded
to
go
anywhere
out
of
the
solitude
of
nature
in
which
she
had
tried
to
hide
but
he
assured
her
of
privacy
and
protection
and
she
was
spent
and
beaten
and
she
gave
in
like
a
child
she
stood
to
be
wrapped
in
the
rug
and
lifted
into
the
buggy
and
they
proceeded
on
their
way
to
his
home
where
his
old
sister
kept
house
for
him
and
mothered
his
child
with
the
aid
of
one
servant
it
was
nearly
midnight
when
they
arrived
and
the
parsonage
was
dark
miss
goldsworthy
not
expecting
him
was
sitting
up
with
a
sick
parishioner
half
a
mile
off
ruby
and
the
maid
were
fast
asleep
when
the
latter
was
heard
stirring
in
her
room
her
master
called
a
few
questions
to
her
and
then
bade
her
go
back
to
bed
we
do
want
her
poking
round
he
whispered
to
mary
as
when
together
they
had
hurried
the
mare
into
her
stall
he
led
the
drooping
girl
to
his
study
and
how
grateful
she
was
to
him
for
this
consideration
he
closed
the
door
behind
them
and
led
her
gently
to
his
own
she
clung
to
the
hand
that
was
so
kind
to
her
in
her
need
bidding
her
keep
the
rug
about
her
so
as
not
to
wet
the
furniture
and
he
lit
a
kerosene
stove
that
was
one
of
his
private
luxuries
always
available
when
the
was
not
he
exhorted
his
charge
to
comfort
herself
by
the
poor
blaze
while
he
fetched
such
odds
and
ends
of
clothes
as
he
could
gather
from
his
sister
room
and
then
he
told
her
to
change
her
wet
garments
for
these
dry
ones
while
he
performed
the
same
operation
for
himself
elsewhere
she
obeyed
him
as
meekly
as
a
child
and
was
sitting
huddled
in
miss
goldsworthy
faded
flannel
when
he
returned
carrying
a
kettle
and
a
tray
now
i
will
make
you
a
nice
hot
cup
of
tea
said
he
cheerily
planting
the
kettle
on
a
round
hole
at
the
top
of
the
stove
and
the
tray
on
his
writing
table
you
put
your
clothes
in
the
passage
that
right
we
dry
them
presently
oh
yes
starting
to
cut
bread
and
butter
you
must
have
something
to
eat
you
have
had
no
dinner
he
forced
her
to
eat
and
to
drink
the
hot
tea
and
she
did
feel
the
better
for
it
over
her
cup
she
lifted
swimming
eyes
to
his
face
whispering
you
are
good
to
me
and
he
remarked
to
himself
that
she
was
not
mad
as
he
had
thought
when
the
meal
was
disposed
of
he
felt
that
the
time
for
explanations
and
for
considering
how
to
deal
with
the
extraordinary
situation
had
come
now
my
dear
he
began
taking
on
something
of
the
parson
air
at
last
the
first
thing
to
be
done
is
to
inform
your
family
of
your
whereabouts
i
must
go
and
find
up
somebody
to
take
a
message
to
them
to
relieve
their
minds
she
roused
from
her
to
plead
for
a
reprieve
not
yet
not
yet
whatever
she
had
to
face
let
her
rest
for
a
little
first
they
had
parted
with
her
for
the
night
they
would
not
go
to
her
room
she
knew
outcast
as
she
now
was
from
the
sympathy
of
them
all
they
would
not
miss
her
before
the
morning
and
oh
she
could
not
go
home
she
had
disgraced
her
family
her
own
father
had
wished
her
dead
she
was
a
wicked
woman
not
fit
to
live
but
if
she
must
live
let
it
be
anywhere
anywhere
rather
than
at
redford
now
at
this
repetition
of
her
strange
charge
against
a
doting
father
and
the
mention
of
disgrace
a
distressing
suspicion
came
into
the
mind
he
calculated
the
length
of
time
between
guthrie
carey
visits
he
looked
at
her
searchingly
no
there
was
no
evidence
that
she
had
done
the
special
wrong
but
that
there
was
wrong
of
some
sort
somewhere
was
evident
enough
i
know
your
father
affection
for
you
he
said
seriously
and
i
can
not
believe
that
he
would
express
himself
as
you
say
he
did
i
deserved
it
she
said
i
do
blame
him
nobody
could
there
must
indeed
have
been
some
grave
reason
there
was
there
was
what
was
it
oh
do
ask
me
she
wailed
covering
her
face
but
crossing
over
to
her
side
he
took
one
of
the
shielding
hands
and
holding
it
tenderly
assured
her
that
she
must
tell
him
he
was
her
pastor
he
was
her
best
friend
just
now
he
was
her
champion
prepared
to
fight
her
battle
whatever
it
was
and
to
do
this
successfully
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
know
all
in
the
end
she
told
him
not
all
but
the
main
facts
he
thought
it
the
silliest
case
of
making
a
mountain
of
a
molehill
that
he
had
ever
heard
of
he
was
convinced
there
was
more
in
the
background
to
account
for
the
violent
emotions
aroused
to
account
for
a
good
girl
leaving
a
good
home
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
drown
herself
in
his
conjectures
he
made
guthrie
carey
the
villain
of
the
piece
the
young
man
who
after
creating
all
the
disturbance
had
significantly
cleared
out
sailors
were
an
immoral
lot
a
sweetheart
in
every
port
as
the
world
knew
and
this
fellow
why
you
had
only
to
look
at
his
big
brawny
build
mr
goldsworthy
was
a
small
man
to
see
that
he
had
a
brutal
nature
at
any
rate
the
parson
was
satisfied
that
the
heroine
of
the
story
remained
a
pure
girl
foolish
but
womanly
and
very
very
unfortunate
as
she
sat
weeping
by
his
side
dependent
solely
upon
his
protection
he
stroked
her
hand
and
looked
at
it
so
shapely
and
the
hand
of
a
pennycuick
of
the
great
house
a
hand
that
would
be
full
of
gold
some
day
and
his
thoughts
were
busy
the
beautiful
deborah
was
gone
and
could
never
have
been
for
him
he
had
been
an
idiot
to
think
it
she
had
no
bent
towards
religion
was
ruinously
dressy
and
extravagant
unhousewifely
as
a
woman
could
be
but
miss
pennycuick
great
lady
as
she
was
could
cook
and
sew
was
a
master
hand
with
servants
and
with
children
and
had
never
failed
of
interest
in
the
church
nor
in
him
they
had
always
been
the
best
of
friends
he
and
she
did
it
not
seem
that
providence
had
decreed
they
should
be
more
why
had
he
been
sent
to
the
dam
in
the
nick
of
time
when
he
had
intended
to
stay
at
redford
until
morning
why
was
she
sitting
here
now
alone
with
him
in
his
study
cut
off
from
everybody
else
in
the
world
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
in
it
looks
were
of
small
account
when
one
considered
her
rank
and
the
fortune
she
would
inherit
but
of
course
he
did
not
admit
to
himself
that
he
considered
any
one
of
these
three
things
nor
that
she
was
of
age
and
her
own
mistress
although
she
had
just
forced
the
fact
upon
him
when
promising
him
to
make
no
further
attempt
upon
her
life
she
announced
an
intention
to
find
a
situation
somewhere
in
which
she
would
be
able
to
support
herself
apart
from
her
family
and
away
from
all
who
knew
her
no
what
he
considered
was
the
will
of
god
and
the
dictates
of
his
conscience
she
had
been
given
into
his
hands
he
was
bound
to
take
care
of
her
and
there
was
but
one
way
to
do
it
it
would
be
wrong
and
cruel
to
force
her
back
to
redford
it
was
preposterous
to
think
of
making
a
governess
or
companion
of
her
a
daughter
of
the
proud
pennycuicks
she
could
not
remain
in
his
house
as
she
was
without
scandal
although
he
was
a
clergyman
with
a
sister
housekeeper
here
they
were
now
past
midnight
and
practically
without
a
soul
in
the
house
and
he
so
young
still
and
if
he
might
presume
to
say
it
so
attractive
he
put
the
case
to
her
guardedly
gradually
plainly
at
last
and
argued
it
for
a
full
hour
while
she
drooped
and
wept
gazing
at
the
smelly
stove
and
shaking
her
head
wearily
by
the
time
dawn
came
and
she
was
quite
worn
out
he
had
won
her
consent
to
be
his
wife
which
meant
for
her
a
footing
somewhere
and
at
the
same
time
a
means
to
commit
suicide
without
violating
the
law
miss
goldsworthy
who
was
but
his
humble
slave
came
home
put
the
forlorn
girl
to
bed
and
made
a
wedding
breakfast
for
her
while
she
was
there
mr
goldsworthy
took
the
opportunity
to
fill
up
marriage
papers
in
his
study
ruby
was
sent
to
school
as
usual
before
her
return
therefrom
mary
pennycuick
had
been
led
to
the
altar
of
the
adjacent
church
the
white
frock
in
which
she
had
tried
to
drown
herself
dried
and
ironed
to
make
her
bridal
robe
a
neighbouring
clergyman
and
crony
of
the
bridegroom
performed
the
ceremony
old
miss
goldsworthy
the
chief
witness
deposed
bewildered
wept
bitterly
the
bride
was
unmoved
until
little
ruby
returning
during
the
course
of
the
ghastly
wedding
breakfast
was
brought
up
giggling
and
staring
to
kiss
her
new
mamma
when
the
new
mamma
snatched
the
child
to
her
breast
and
went
off
into
wild
hysterics
there
there
said
the
new
husband
pleased
with
the
maternal
gesture
but
alarmed
by
her
excitement
you
are
overwrought
you
have
had
no
sleep
you
must
come
and
rest
my
dear
come
and
lie
down
you
can
have
ruby
with
you
if
you
like
while
i
go
and
settle
things
at
redford
no
i
wo
be
long
i
just
see
your
father
and
be
back
by
have
the
opened
charlotte
it
never
was
opened
except
for
visitors
and
we
will
sit
there
this
evening
and
meanwhile
make
her
some
tea
or
something
and
see
that
she
has
all
she
wants
come
my
love
he
led
her
to
the
door
of
a
room
and
she
shrank
back
from
it
with
a
shriek
well
well
he
soothed
her
the
spare
room
if
you
like
oh
promise
me
promise
me
yes
yes
just
as
you
wish
darling
i
would
not
hurry
you
she
turned
to
miss
goldsworthy
and
clung
to
her
save
me
save
me
was
what
the
desperate
clutch
meant
but
what
the
paralysed
tongue
could
not
articulate
she
was
in
a
high
fever
and
delirious
on
her
wedding
night
and
a
week
later
at
death
door
when
she
came
out
of
her
illness
reconciled
to
her
family
meekly
obedient
to
her
husband
she
was
a
wreck
of
herself
a
prisoner
for
life
bound
hand
and
foot
more
pitiable
than
she
would
have
been
as
a
dead
body
fished
out
of
the
dam
the
tragic
disproportion
between
crimes
and
punishments
in
this
world
chapter
xii
mrs
goldsworthy
was
reconciled
to
her
relations
through
her
illness
the
greatest
peacemaker
in
families
save
death
and
for
her
sake
they
made
a
show
of
tolerating
her
husband
after
they
had
given
him
some
bad
hours
behind
her
back
but
the
whole
affair
was
like
a
blight
on
redford
which
was
never
the
same
place
again
mr
pennycuick
had
a
slight
stroke
on
hearing
all
the
bad
news
at
once
it
was
light
enough
to
be
passed
over
and
hushed
up
but
his
vigour
and
faculties
declined
from
that
hour
with
a
rapidity
that
could
be
marked
from
day
to
day
a
changed
man
observed
his
neighbours
one
to
another
at
the
same
time
they
hinted
that
other
things
were
not
as
they
used
to
be
that
the
old
man
had
had
losses
that
redford
was
heavily
burdened
that
the
proud
pennycuicks
already
humbled
were
likely
to
experience
a
further
fall
certainly
the
governess
was
dispensed
with
and
the
dashing
withdrawn
from
the
local
racecourses
and
agricultural
of
which
it
had
long
been
the
constant
and
conspicuous
ornament
to
be
sold
at
public
auction
without
reason
given
the
great
hospitable
house
got
a
character
for
dullness
for
the
first
time
in
its
history
no
lights
or
laughter
flowed
from
the
windows
of
the
big
of
an
evening
the
lawns
lay
dark
and
still
while
downstairs
a
rubber
of
whist
or
a
hand
at
cribbage
with
jim
urquhart
or
mr
thornycroft
represented
what
was
left
of
the
gaieties
of
the
past
these
men
these
old
fogies
as
fretful
frances
styled
them
both
were
not
of
those
who
shunned
redford
because
it
had
grown
dull
on
the
contrary
they
now
according
to
frances
again
virtually
lived
there
and
it
was
the
absent
her
true
kindred
for
whom
her
soul
longed
he
who
most
openly
resented
the
change
having
next
to
mary
been
most
instrumental
in
causing
it
was
deborah
lover
claud
dalzell
he
had
been
none
too
gracious
a
lover
although
graceful
enough
when
all
was
well
seeing
that
he
had
continued
his
bachelor
life
with
all
its
social
obligations
after
as
before
his
engagement
and
had
allowed
this
to
run
to
nearly
two
years
without
coming
to
any
effective
understanding
about
the
but
when
in
the
thick
of
her
troubles
he
descended
upon
redford
merely
to
denounce
the
goldsworthy
marriage
as
a
personal
affront
and
as
it
were
to
tax
her
with
it
then
her
loving
indulgence
did
not
suffice
to
excuse
him
as
usual
he
went
to
his
room
first
to
wash
and
change
he
hated
to
pass
the
door
of
a
with
the
dust
of
travel
on
him
he
could
not
shake
hands
with
equanimity
until
he
had
restored
his
person
and
toilet
to
their
normal
perfection
which
meant
more
or
less
the
restoring
of
his
nerves
and
temper
to
repose
so
he
appeared
on
this
occasion
fresh
and
finished
to
the
last
degree
the
finest
gentleman
in
the
world
the
very
light
of
deb
eyes
and
the
satisfaction
of
her
own
fastidious
taste
walking
in
to
her
where
she
awaited
him
in
the
herself
to
match
with
as
much
care
as
she
had
taken
when
she
had
no
more
serious
matter
to
think
of
than
how
to
dress
to
please
him
he
met
her
apparently
as
usual
she
turning
to
him
as
to
a
rock
in
a
weary
land
flung
herself
into
his
arms
with
more
than
her
usual
oh
darling
she
breathed
in
that
delicious
voice
of
hers
it
is
good
to
see
you
i
have
wanted
you
so
badly
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
come
before
he
replied
kissing
her
gravely
somebody
has
been
wanted
to
deal
with
that
extraordinary
girl
ah
poor
girl
do
you
know
she
is
very
ill
with
brain
fever
keziah
has
gone
to
nurse
her
it
must
have
been
that
coming
on
she
was
out
of
her
mind
i
should
think
so
and
everybody
else
too
apparently
what
were
you
all
about
debbie
not
to
see
this
goldsworthy
affair
going
on
under
your
noses
it
has
been
going
on
it
has
been
guthrie
carey
until
now
i
am
told
it
was
frances
who
had
told
him
in
the
passage
just
now
that
she
refused
carey
only
the
day
before
she
did
in
order
to
make
a
runaway
match
with
this
parson
fellow
the
facts
speak
for
themselves
ah
sighed
deb
turning
to
the
i
expect
we
do
know
all
the
facts
she
meant
that
he
did
not
know
them
he
only
knew
what
frances
knew
and
providentially
they
had
been
able
to
keep
the
episode
of
the
dam
out
of
the
published
story
that
was
the
secret
of
mary
herself
her
husband
her
father
and
this
one
sister
and
they
kept
it
close
even
from
claud
dalzell
i
will
tell
him
some
day
when
we
are
married
deb
had
promised
herself
but
as
things
fell
out
she
never
did
tell
him
and
it
was
on
account
of
her
part
in
the
suppressed
event
that
she
now
forbore
to
call
him
behind
his
back
what
she
had
not
hesitated
to
call
him
before
his
face
that
is
failed
to
show
that
she
fully
shared
her
lover
indignation
at
the
mesalliance
and
the
scandalous
way
that
it
had
been
brought
about
but
good
heavens
claud
took
his
cup
perfunctorily
from
her
hand
and
at
once
set
it
down
are
more
facts
necessary
she
has
made
a
clandestine
marriage
with
a
man
whose
bishop
will
turn
him
out
of
the
church
i
hope
they
were
right
i
suppose
in
concluding
that
no
one
here
would
consent
to
it
and
what
conceivable
circumstances
could
excuse
such
an
act
illness
said
deb
madness
nonsense
there
too
much
method
in
it
it
is
obviously
but
the
climax
of
a
long
intrigue
a
course
of
duplicity
that
i
could
never
have
believed
possible
in
a
girl
like
mary
although
i
have
always
thought
him
cad
enough
for
anything
have
your
tea
said
deb
a
trifle
it
will
be
cold
and
she
sat
down
with
her
own
cup
and
began
to
sip
it
with
a
leisurely
air
a
clandestine
marriage
remarked
claud
ignoring
her
advice
logically
implies
a
clandestine
engagement
carey
was
but
a
red
herring
across
the
trail
and
you
ought
to
have
known
it
deb
well
i
did
said
she
shortly
he
took
a
turn
up
and
down
the
room
trying
to
preserve
his
wonted
calm
but
he
was
intensely
irritated
by
her
attitude
i
can
not
understand
you
he
complained
with
a
hard
edge
to
his
voice
i
should
have
thought
that
you
you
of
all
people
would
have
been
wild
as
wild
as
i
am
she
exasperated
him
with
a
little
laugh
and
a
truly
cutting
sarcasm
it
is
bad
form
to
show
that
you
are
wild
you
know
even
if
you
feel
so
i
am
just
wondering
whether
you
feel
so
you
are
not
used
to
hiding
your
feelings
at
any
rate
from
me
i
expected
to
find
you
out
of
your
mind
almost
what
the
use
if
i
raved
till
doomsday
i
could
alter
anything
the
mischief
is
done
it
is
no
use
crying
over
spilt
milk
my
dear
you
look
as
if
you
did
not
want
to
cry
do
i
as
if
it
did
not
much
matter
to
you
whether
it
was
spilt
or
not
it
does
matter
to
me
compared
with
what
it
matters
to
her
well
it
matters
to
me
claud
dalzell
announced
in
a
high
tone
the
crust
of
his
fine
manners
giving
to
the
pressure
of
the
volcano
within
i
stand
the
connection
if
you
can
carey
was
bad
enough
but
he
had
some
claim
beside
his
coat
to
rank
as
a
gentleman
this
crawling
ass
who
would
lick
your
boots
for
sixpence
to
have
him
patting
me
on
the
back
and
calling
himself
my
brother
good
god
it
too
sickening
not
your
brother
deb
gently
corrected
him
he
is
mine
if
he
is
yours
oh
not
necessarily
deb
said
claud
with
an
air
of
desperation
planting
himself
before
her
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
looked
up
at
him
with
narrowing
eyes
and
stiffening
lips
what
is
there
to
do
she
returned
are
you
going
to
put
up
with
this
this
outrage
to
condone
everything
to
tolerate
that
fellow
at
redford
taking
the
position
of
a
son
of
the
house
or
are
you
going
to
show
them
both
that
they
have
forfeited
their
right
ever
to
set
foot
upon
the
place
again
my
sister
too
you
mean
certainly
if
you
can
still
bring
yourself
to
call
her
your
sister
she
belongs
to
him
now
not
to
us
she
has
voluntarily
cut
herself
off
from
her
world
let
her
go
deb
if
you
love
me
he
paused
and
deb
smiled
into
his
handsome
but
disgusted
face
ah
is
that
to
be
a
test
of
love
she
asked
i
understand
i
am
to
choose
between
you
well
she
rose
towering
drawing
the
big
diamond
from
her
engagement
finger
i
am
going
to
her
now
i
ought
to
have
been
there
hours
ago
but
waited
back
to
receive
you
and
pray
do
come
again
to
this
contaminated
house
we
have
too
horribly
gone
down
in
the
world
i
know
it
and
i
would
not
have
you
compromised
on
any
account
we
pennycuicks
we
do
abandon
our
belongings
especially
when
they
may
be
dying
we
sink
or
swim
together
she
held
the
jewel
out
to
him
what
rot
he
blurted
vulgarly
flushing
with
anger
that
was
not
unmixed
with
shame
why
will
you
wilfully
misunderstand
me
put
it
on
deb
put
it
on
and
do
be
so
childish
i
will
not
put
it
on
said
she
until
you
apologise
for
the
things
you
have
been
saying
to
me
and
the
manner
of
your
saying
them
my
dear
child
i
do
apologise
humbly
if
i
have
said
what
i
should
perhaps
i
have
but
i
thought
we
were
past
the
need
for
reserves
and
for
weighing
words
you
and
i
and
really
debbie
you
know
hush
she
stopped
him
from
further
arguing
but
she
did
not
stop
him
from
taking
her
hand
and
cramming
the
diamond
back
into
its
old
place
i
must
go
father
can
not
he
is
ill
himself
and
miss
keene
is
too
frightfully
modest
to
nurse
him
alone
so
that
i
must
send
keziah
back
and
stay
ca
miss
keene
go
and
send
her
back
and
stay
oh
she
would
be
no
use
in
such
an
illness
as
mary
and
i
must
see
for
myself
how
things
are
whether
they
are
taking
proper
care
of
the
poor
unfortunate
child
is
she
so
very
ill
i
did
not
know
that
there
was
commiseration
in
his
tone
but
in
his
heart
he
hoped
that
the
deservedly
sick
woman
would
crown
her
escapades
by
dying
as
quickly
as
possible
then
perhaps
he
could
forgive
her
deb
gave
him
sundry
confidences
on
his
appearing
to
take
them
in
a
proper
spirit
she
gave
him
some
more
tea
and
so
they
lapsed
into
their
normal
relations
when
she
again
urged
the
need
for
her
to
be
getting
off
on
her
errand
of
mercy
he
magnanimously
offered
to
drive
her
she
accepted
with
a
full
heart
and
her
arms
about
his
neck
while
she
was
getting
ready
he
repacked
his
portmanteau
and
ordered
it
to
be
put
into
the
buggy
it
no
use
my
going
back
he
said
to
her
when
they
were
on
the
road
with
you
away
and
your
father
too
ill
to
see
me
i
put
up
at
the
hotel
tonight
and
go
on
to
town
in
the
morning
you
can
send
for
me
there
whenever
you
want
me
you
know
just
as
you
like
dear
said
deb
quietly
and
for
the
rest
of
their
journey
they
talked
commonplaces
when
they
reached
the
parsonage
gate
from
which
the
and
a
group
of
street
gossips
scattered
in
panic
at
their
approach
the
lovers
shook
hands
perfunctorily
goodbye
then
for
a
little
while
said
claud
you
do
want
me
to
come
in
do
you
certainly
not
said
she
coldly
you
know
that
it
is
totally
against
my
judgment
and
my
wishes
that
you
go
in
yourself
deb
yes
but
one
own
judgment
must
be
one
guide
thus
they
parted
each
with
a
grievance
against
the
other
a
root
of
bitterness
to
be
nourished
by
much
thinking
about
it
and
by
the
circumstance
that
poor
mary
neither
died
nor
was
repudiated
claud
drove
on
to
the
hotel
to
be
further
disgusted
with
his
accommodation
and
his
dinner
deb
walked
into
the
house
which
hitherto
she
had
visited
in
a
spirit
of
kindly
condescension
to
be
revolted
by
the
new
aspect
which
her
changed
relations
with
it
now
gave
to
its
every
feature
ruby
neglected
with
a
face
the
flustered
maid
tousled
grubby
her
frock
gaping
the
horrible
hall
with
its
paper
and
staring
linoleum
the
prim
trivial
unaired
unused
with
its
pathetic
attempts
at
elegance
deb
inwardly
curled
up
at
the
sight
of
these
things
as
things
now
belonging
to
the
family
when
the
master
of
the
house
came
hurrying
in
to
her
rusty
unshaven
abject
she
would
have
changed
places
with
a
christian
of
old
rome
facing
a
lion
of
the
amphitheatre
oh
this
is
good
of
you
this
is
kind
indeed
mr
goldsworthy
greeted
her
and
threatened
in
his
grateful
emotion
to
fall
at
her
feet
i
did
not
dare
to
hope
but
deb
shudderingly
swept
him
aside
with
his
gratitude
and
his
excuses
and
his
timid
justifications
he
could
stand
up
before
his
other
critics
he
had
a
clear
conscience
he
said
but
before
her
he
knew
himself
for
what
he
was
he
followed
her
like
a
dog
to
room
obeyed
her
directions
like
a
slave
wept
when
she
consented
to
say
no
more
and
stooped
to
beg
from
him
a
solemn
vow
and
promise
that
he
would
be
good
to
his
wife
this
was
after
the
doctors
had
refused
to
permit
his
wife
removal
to
redford
to
be
nursed
and
after
redford
had
practically
been
in
command
of
his
establishment
for
seven
weeks
christmas
is
the
time
for
reconciliations
and
by
christmas
mary
was
convalescent
pale
as
she
had
never
been
since
childhood
and
wearing
a
little
cap
over
her
shaved
head
very
humble
and
gentle
and
strangely
docile
in
her
attitude
towards
her
captor
who
now
gave
himself
all
the
airs
of
a
husband
of
his
class
he
was
the
benevolent
despot
of
his
the
god
of
the
machine
she
was
as
properly
submissive
as
if
born
in
the
ranks
negatively
so
that
is
to
say
positively
her
manifestations
of
duty
to
him
took
the
form
of
services
and
endearments
bestowed
upon
his
child
and
sister
her
first
occupation
after
she
could
use
her
hands
was
to
improve
ruby
wardrobe
the
little
girl
now
her
own
appealed
to
her
motherly
heart
a
saving
interest
in
her
wrecked
life
the
poor
old
was
the
other
prop
to
which
she
clung
for
a
footing
in
the
new
and
alien
world
which
was
now
all
her
home
when
miss
goldsworthy
proposed
to
go
out
into
a
situation
not
to
be
in
the
way
of
the
new
wife
and
when
her
brother
would
have
approved
the
plan
as
only
right
and
proper
and
as
facilitating
his
schemes
for
the
raising
of
the
tone
of
his
establishment
to
redford
level
mary
protested
vehemently
and
with
tears
the
only
occasion
of
her
showing
a
pennycuick
spirit
since
renouncing
the
pennycuick
name
the
old
maid
for
her
part
was
enthusiastically
devoted
to
the
new
whom
it
was
her
joy
to
pet
and
coddle
i
can
be
of
use
to
her
she
tremblingly
commended
herself
to
her
brother
i
can
take
the
drudgery
of
the
housework
off
her
and
save
her
in
the
parish
well
perhaps
so
said
mr
goldsworthy
and
sincerely
desiring
to
endear
himself
to
his
aristocratic
wife
he
consented
to
her
wish
the
whole
goldsworthy
family
was
transferred
to
redford
while
on
the
pretext
of
disinfecting
it
the
parsonage
was
painted
and
papered
what
deb
called
decently
and
its
more
offensive
furniture
replaced
mary
was
provided
with
a
trousseau
and
many
useful
wedding
presents
a
cheque
from
her
father
for
pounds
amongst
them
they
did
not
forgive
her
but
they
pretended
excellently
that
they
did
without
any
pretence
at
all
they
tried
to
make
the
best
of
a
bad
job
to
this
end
they
gathered
their
friends
together
as
usual
at
christmas
mr
thornycroft
and
the
urquharts
needed
no
pressing
they
came
to
see
mary
the
day
she
returned
home
and
showed
her
the
old
affection
without
asking
questions
mr
thornycroft
wedding
presents
to
her
were
magnificent
a
complete
service
of
silver
plate
and
house
linen
of
the
finest
deb
wrote
to
claud
i
suppose
we
shall
see
you
as
usual
for
he
had
always
spent
christmas
at
redford
unless
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
he
wrote
back
i
think
not
this
time
he
was
the
only
defaulter
he
will
never
have
a
chance
to
refuse
again
said
deb
fiercely
as
she
tore
up
his
note
his
absence
was
too
marked
not
to
provoke
frequent
comment
and
whenever
it
was
alluded
to
in
her
hearing
her
spine
stiffened
and
her
head
went
up
it
was
quite
evident
to
her
family
that
the
rift
in
the
lute
was
serious
and
strange
to
say
it
was
her
father
who
might
have
been
expected
to
hail
the
signs
who
was
most
concerned
to
see
them
he
expostulated
with
her
when
she
spoke
bitterly
of
billy
son
as
once
he
had
been
so
ready
to
do
himself
well
my
dear
said
he
i
can
understand
it
if
you
ca
i
would
come
myself
if
i
was
in
his
place
to
with
the
sort
of
thing
we
got
to
mix
up
with
if
i
can
mix
up
with
it
quoth
proud
deborah
yes
yes
i
know
but
you
must
consider
the
silly
way
that
he
been
reared
i
do
like
his
taking
upon
himself
to
criticise
what
we
choose
to
do
but
no
doubt
goldsworthy
is
a
pretty
big
pill
to
swallow
to
a
chap
like
him
always
so
faddy
about
breeding
and
manners
and
that
sort
of
thing
if
he
is
too
faddy
for
the
society
that
i
can
put
up
with
though
it
be
that
of
said
deb
he
is
too
faddy
for
me
father
now
my
dear
do
talk
so
the
old
man
pleaded
with
her
quite
agitated
by
her
mood
we
all
have
our
little
weaknesses
we
have
to
make
allowances
for
temperament
and
for
bringing
up
do
let
a
trifle
like
this
estrange
you
two
do
debbie
for
my
sake
let
me
go
down
to
my
grave
feeling
that
one
of
you
at
least
is
safe
and
happy
and
well
provided
for
decidedly
thought
deborah
father
is
not
the
same
man
that
he
was
before
his
illness
she
understood
the
cause
of
his
change
of
views
on
her
engagement
better
a
few
weeks
later
he
had
parted
with
his
eldest
daughter
then
and
the
emotion
of
the
event
had
fatally
affected
him
owing
to
some
obscure
working
of
the
influence
which
her
social
position
had
brought
to
her
husband
the
latter
had
been
promoted
to
the
charge
of
a
melbourne
parish
the
affair
was
arranged
while
they
were
still
at
redford
and
just
on
the
completion
of
the
improvements
to
the
local
parsonage
in
spite
of
all
they
had
done
to
make
this
first
home
fit
for
her
family
and
friends
were
unanimous
in
hailing
her
removal
to
another
and
more
distant
one
out
of
the
buzz
of
the
gossip
of
her
native
neighbourhood
as
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
but
when
it
came
to
the
point
of
sending
her
forth
to
battle
with
her
fate
alone
for
the
rest
of
her
life
the
wrench
was
dreadful
she
was
the
bravest
of
them
all
under
the
ordeal
the
shattered
father
whose
right
hand
she
had
been
for
so
many
happy
years
and
whose
heart
was
broken
with
the
weight
of
his
responsibility
for
her
misfortunes
was
completely
overwhelmed
she
had
not
been
gone
twelve
hours
when
deb
found
him
in
his
office
chair
unable
to
rise
from
it
or
to
answer
her
questions
and
he
never
spoke
again
he
made
signs
that
he
wanted
claud
sent
for
and
when
the
young
man
quickly
came
looked
significant
things
at
him
and
deb
as
they
stood
by
his
bedside
hand
in
hand
then
he
lapsed
into
stupor
and
died
without
waiting
for
a
third
stroke
through
all
the
shock
and
sorrow
of
the
time
claud
was
mainstay
and
consolation
he
took
the
role
of
nearest
male
relative
the
right
to
which
was
undisputed
by
mr
goldsworthy
preoccupied
with
the
important
interests
of
his
new
parish
also
by
mr
thornycroft
and
jim
urquhart
who
of
course
stood
by
to
serve
her
as
far
as
she
would
allow
them
it
was
claud
who
gave
the
orders
for
the
funeral
and
superintended
the
ceremonies
and
acted
as
chief
mourner
it
was
claud
to
whom
the
household
looked
for
direction
as
if
acknowledging
him
to
be
the
new
master
it
was
on
claud
breast
that
deb
wept
who
so
rarely
wept
and
his
word
that
she
obeyed
as
if
he
were
already
her
husband
and
in
all
that
he
did
for
her
and
in
all
that
he
did
not
do
he
showed
the
grace
the
tact
the
tenderness
the
thoughtfulness
of
her
ideal
lover
and
gentleman
but
there
came
a
day
when
he
fell
again
below
the
indispensable
standard
when
the
rift
in
the
lute
that
had
seemed
closed
gaped
suddenly
and
this
time
beyond
repair
it
was
when
after
close
investigation
of
the
deceased
man
affairs
and
some
heated
interviews
with
one
of
the
executors
deb
being
the
other
claud
discovered
that
the
pennycuick
wealth
was
that
redford
was
mortgaged
to
the
hilt
and
that
if
the
estate
was
realised
and
cleared
as
deb
desired
it
should
be
nothing
would
be
left
for
her
and
her
sisters
that
is
to
say
a
paltry
three
or
four
hundred
a
year
amongst
them
less
than
deb
could
spend
comfortably
on
her
clothes
alone
he
was
too
upset
by
the
discovery
and
a
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
that
mr
thornycroft
had
subsequently
given
him
to
preserve
that
calm
demeanour
which
was
his
study
and
his
pride
he
came
in
to
deb
where
she
sat
alone
and
expressed
his
feelings
as
the
ordinary
man
is
wont
to
do
to
the
woman
who
loves
and
belongs
to
him
what
could
your
father
have
been
dreaming
of
he
rudely
interrogated
her
to
let
the
place
go
to
pieces
like
this
drifting
behind
year
after
year
and
doing
nothing
to
stop
it
not
cutting
down
one
of
the
living
expenses
not
giving
us
the
least
hint
of
how
things
really
were
he
gave
several
hints
said
deb
in
that
voice
which
always
grew
so
portentously
quiet
when
his
was
raised
if
we
had
had
the
sense
to
take
them
i
have
been
putting
two
and
two
together
for
some
time
so
that
i
am
not
altogether
taken
by
surprise
why
did
you
tell
me
because
you
were
not
here
for
one
thing
because
it
was
private
business
for
another
he
seems
not
to
have
made
it
his
business
to
take
any
care
of
his
children
interests
said
claud
bitterly
bringing
you
up
as
he
has
done
with
the
right
to
expect
that
you
were
to
be
properly
provided
for
and
then
leaving
you
literally
paupers
not
literally
paupers
corrected
deb
gently
we
shall
be
quite
independent
still
and
if
you
want
to
insult
my
father
now
that
he
is
dead
the
best
of
fathers
if
he
did
have
misfortunes
in
business
and
make
mistakes
do
it
somewhere
else
not
in
this
room
you
have
no
right
to
take
that
tone
with
me
deb
no
she
raised
sarcastic
eyebrows
under
which
her
deep
eyes
gleamed
well
i
suppose
i
have
now
i
forgot
my
new
place
i
am
very
sorry
claud
rising
and
making
a
gesture
with
her
hands
that
he
had
seen
before
very
sorry
indeed
that
i
did
not
know
i
was
going
to
be
a
poor
woman
and
a
nobody
when
you
did
me
the
honour
to
select
me
to
be
your
wife
now
that
you
have
shown
me
that
i
am
disqualified
for
the
position
she
held
out
the
big
diamond
with
a
cold
smile
that
vulgar
deb
he
loftily
admonished
her
fending
off
her
hand
you
know
i
am
not
actuated
by
those
low
motives
do
let
us
have
this
cheap
melodrama
for
pity
sake
put
it
on
but
no
more
would
she
put
it
on
he
had
revealed
his
disappointment
that
she
was
not
something
more
than
herself
that
beautiful
and
adorable
self
that
she
quite
knew
the
worth
of
and
he
had
permitted
himself
to
take
liberties
of
speech
with
her
that
she
instinctively
felt
to
be
provoked
by
the
circumstance
that
she
was
no
longer
rich
and
powerful
deb
love
was
great
but
her
pride
was
greater
chapter
xiii
deb
sat
amid
the
ruins
of
her
home
she
occupied
the
lid
of
a
deal
that
enclosed
a
few
hundreds
of
books
and
one
that
was
half
filled
stood
before
her
with
a
scatter
of
odd
volumes
on
the
floor
around
the
floor
which
was
that
of
the
once
cosy
was
carpetless
its
usual
furniture
stood
about
all
in
the
wrong
places
naked
and
forlorn
mr
thornycroft
leaned
against
the
flowerless
and
surveyed
the
scene
or
rather
the
central
figure
with
sleeves
turned
back
from
her
strong
wrists
and
a
grey
smudge
on
her
beautiful
nose
that
cottage
that
you
talk
about
said
he
will
not
hold
all
those
oh
books
do
take
any
space
she
replied
brusquely
they
are
no
more
than
tapestry
or
frescoes
i
shall
have
cases
made
to
fit
flat
to
the
walls
that
will
cost
money
one
must
have
the
bare
necessaries
of
life
i
presume
i
shall
be
able
to
afford
that
much
pine
boards
will
do
i
can
aspinall
them
aspinall
is
very
nice
but
sometimes
it
gets
on
the
edges
of
your
books
and
spoils
them
no
it
does
i
have
an
aspinalled
in
my
room
now
and
not
a
mark
ever
came
off
it
did
you
paint
it
i
did
are
you
going
to
leave
it
there
i
must
it
is
a
fixture
that
all
right
i
am
glad
you
are
going
to
leave
something
something
i
leave
all
except
a
library
of
books
and
a
collection
of
forty
odd
pictures
that
you
will
have
to
hang
over
the
books
you
would
not
have
us
part
with
family
portraits
and
a
grand
piano
extra
sized
calculated
to
fill
a
suburban
villa
all
by
itself
pianos
make
nothing
and
the
girls
must
practise
better
keep
a
good
instrument
than
sell
it
for
fifty
pounds
and
spend
the
money
on
a
bad
one
certainly
if
you
can
stow
it
but
with
seven
and
the
biggest
chesterfield
sofa
extant
and
a
large
i
can
have
that
in
my
room
along
with
a
and
a
wardrobe
and
i
do
know
how
many
chests
of
drawers
the
wardrobe
will
stand
in
a
passage
somewhere
we
must
have
places
to
put
our
clothes
a
house
with
passages
of
that
capacity
well
never
you
mind
if
i
ca
find
room
for
my
things
i
can
sell
them
in
melbourne
as
well
as
here
having
squandered
a
small
fortune
on
the
carriage
down
better
leave
them
with
me
debbie
and
let
me
send
you
what
you
want
afterwards
thank
you
you
would
not
have
them
to
send
afterwards
oh
i
think
i
would
no
i
shall
settle
everything
before
i
leave
and
the
sale
will
be
held
immediately
the
furniture
first
and
then
the
place
her
mouth
closed
upon
the
words
like
a
steel
snap
just
as
you
please
about
that
he
said
quietly
any
time
will
suit
me
by
public
auction
she
added
with
a
sharp
glance
at
him
to
the
highest
bidder
yes
was
his
laconic
comment
me
not
necessarily
said
she
roused
by
the
small
word
that
held
such
large
meanings
there
are
a
few
other
rich
persons
in
the
western
district
to
whom
redford
may
appear
desirable
there
are
he
agreed
easily
i
know
several
but
i
shall
outbid
them
she
was
strongly
agitated
oh
i
hope
they
wo
let
you
why
he
asked
at
first
she
fenced
with
the
question
because
you
do
want
it
you
have
more
land
already
than
one
man
ought
to
have
i
do
know
about
what
i
ought
to
have
but
i
know
that
if
you
persist
in
throwing
redford
away
i
shall
take
it
he
smiled
at
her
angry
perturbation
if
i
find
i
have
enough
money
to
outbid
everybody
but
i
think
i
have
i
can
sell
bundaboo
if
you
have
redford
i
will
yes
and
every
stick
and
stone
that
belongs
to
it
and
have
people
talking
and
saying
that
you
did
it
for
something
else
and
not
business
reasons
people
would
be
right
for
once
but
i
wo
have
it
cried
deb
i
wo
stand
being
an
object
of
your
benevolence
you
want
to
pay
a
lot
more
than
the
place
is
worth
so
as
to
augment
our
income
you
as
good
as
own
it
i
want
to
keep
your
home
for
you
against
you
change
your
mind
the
last
thing
i
shall
do
i
assure
you
particularly
after
your
saying
that
her
nose
in
spite
of
the
smut
on
it
testified
to
her
indignant
dignity
up
in
the
air
with
its
fine
nostrils
quivering
now
look
here
godpapa
i
will
not
have
redford
put
up
to
auction
i
sell
privately
and
to
somebody
else
you
can
not
oh
indeed
not
when
i
am
executor
certainly
not
except
with
the
permission
of
your
she
fell
to
pleading
oh
let
me
do
let
me
you
know
what
i
want
to
square
up
all
the
debts
and
have
done
with
them
i
ca
sleep
for
thinking
of
what
we
owe
you
already
do
you
know
how
much
it
is
nearly
forty
thou
he
checked
her
with
an
impatient
wave
of
the
hand
all
the
debts
will
be
provided
for
of
course
the
lawyers
will
adjust
those
matters
i
do
trust
you
she
urged
looking
at
him
less
angrily
but
still
as
puzzled
and
distressed
i
know
you
have
designs
to
benefit
me
somehow
unfairly
and
because
it
me
and
if
you
only
knew
how
i
hated
to
be
benefited
i
do
nobody
better
that
is
why
i
am
letting
you
do
a
lot
of
things
that
wo
benefit
you
but
just
the
opposite
things
you
will
repent
of
horribly
knowing
your
independent
spirit
i
do
not
offer
my
advice
oh
not
effectively
i
do
not
force
it
upon
you
i
do
not
bring
my
undoubted
powers
to
bear
upon
you
for
your
good
ah
because
i
know
of
course
that
you
would
rather
suffer
anything
than
be
guided
by
me
she
softened
instantly
i
am
not
such
a
fool
i
hope
but
but
you
will
bring
friendship
into
business
you
did
things
for
my
father
that
you
know
you
would
never
have
dreamt
of
doing
for
strangers
that
you
never
ought
to
have
done
at
all
and
now
you
want
to
be
twice
as
idiotically
generous
to
us
because
we
are
girls
and
out
of
pity
for
us
to
do
us
a
kindness
as
it
is
called
when
if
you
only
knew
she
had
risen
and
drifted
to
him
where
he
stood
and
now
laid
a
hand
on
his
arm
he
put
a
hand
over
it
and
looked
into
her
pleading
eyes
he
seemed
not
to
have
heard
her
last
remark
to
be
far
away
in
mind
from
the
point
of
discussion
and
his
fixed
and
strange
gaze
perplexed
and
then
embarrassed
her
how
he
feels
our
going
she
thought
to
herself
and
turned
her
face
from
his
and
tried
to
turn
his
apparently
sad
thoughts
if
you
would
only
let
me
sell
redford
to
somebody
else
and
have
the
lump
money
to
pay
all
the
debts
in
a
plain
way
that
i
could
understand
and
take
the
remainder
for
ourselves
and
know
that
we
were
straight
and
free
i
would
do
anything
you
liked
to
ask
me
in
return
he
still
kept
silence
and
that
tight
grasp
upon
her
hand
so
she
looked
at
him
again
and
his
stare
was
bewildering
i
wonder
said
he
slowly
i
wonder
if
i
were
to
take
you
at
your
word
whether
you
would
stick
to
it
try
me
said
she
i
will
deborah
pennycuick
if
i
let
you
sell
redford
and
pay
all
debts
with
your
own
hands
will
you
i
am
your
godfather
and
something
over
fifty
and
it
is
quite
preposterous
of
course
but
still
you
said
anything
will
you
be
my
wife
oh
this
was
the
unexpected
happening
with
a
vengeance
never
had
she
imagined
such
a
notion
on
the
part
of
this
staid
and
venerable
person
she
flushed
hotly
and
wrenched
her
imprisoned
hand
free
i
do
like
stupid
jokes
she
muttered
overcome
with
confusion
do
i
give
you
the
impression
that
i
am
joking
he
asked
if
you
are
serious
that
is
worse
said
she
then
i
know
you
are
only
trying
another
way
of
providing
for
me
you
believe
i
have
only
just
thought
of
it
have
you
i
have
thought
of
it
since
you
were
fifteen
my
dear
but
never
mind
we
will
call
it
a
joke
if
you
think
that
the
least
of
two
evils
i
see
you
do
the
incident
is
closed
the
bargain
is
off
and
i
can
buy
redford
when
it
is
put
up
for
sale
goodbye
goddaughter
no
i
stay
to
lunch
today
i
have
some
business
to
attend
to
but
of
course
i
shall
see
you
again
before
you
go
and
when
he
did
see
her
again
he
gave
not
the
smallest
sign
of
what
had
happened
so
that
she
almost
grew
to
feel
that
she
must
have
dreamt
it
that
same
afternoon
jim
urquhart
who
was
always
doing
so
rode
over
to
redford
to
see
if
he
could
help
her
pack
he
wondered
at
her
abstracted
manner
and
her
sudden
change
of
mind
concerning
the
piano
and
wardrobe
and
other
things
having
laboriously
packed
books
and
pictures
she
now
proposed
to
unpack
half
of
them
she
wanted
to
see
what
room
she
would
have
in
her
cottage
first
in
fact
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
did
not
know
what
she
wanted
she
was
evidently
tired
and
overwrought
oh
jim
she
moaned
from
amongst
the
dust
and
litter
it
is
a
wrench
what
do
you
suppose
it
is
for
us
he
returned
gloomily
without
you
at
redford
i
trying
not
to
think
of
it
so
am
i
but
it
no
use
it
has
got
to
come
i
suppose
there
is
no
way
out
none
that
is
all
settled
i
have
told
mr
thornycroft
and
he
tease
me
any
more
do
you
think
you
will
be
happy
down
there
cooped
up
in
streets
i
know
i
shall
not
but
the
streets
down
there
will
be
better
than
the
streets
of
a
bush
township
why
streets
at
all
why
not
stay
about
here
somewhere
where
you
have
us
all
near
you
exiled
from
redford
no
thank
you
besides
where
could
we
stay
detached
cottages
do
grow
in
these
parts
then
he
blurted
it
out
i
have
never
said
anything
deb
i
knew
i
was
fit
for
you
and
i
am
not
now
i
got
to
look
after
my
dear
old
mother
and
the
children
who
have
got
anybody
else
and
i
could
give
you
a
home
worthy
of
you
perhaps
never
no
matter
how
i
worked
and
tried
but
if
love
is
any
good
and
the
things
that
after
all
make
homes
not
money
and
fine
furniture
dear
old
boy
do
she
pleaded
with
twitching
lips
i
may
as
well
now
i
have
begun
said
he
i
do
suppose
it
is
any
use
but
i
just
like
you
to
know
once
as
far
as
my
life
is
my
own
it
is
yours
any
day
you
like
it
has
been
since
i
was
a
boy
and
it
will
be
for
a
good
while
yet
i
wo
say
for
ever
because
you
tell
what
going
to
happen
but
i
ready
to
bet
my
soul
that
it
will
be
for
ever
now
do
just
what
you
feel
inclined
to
debbie
i
not
going
to
press
you
i
know
my
place
too
well
but
if
you
should
think
it
a
better
plan
to
live
with
me
and
have
me
work
for
you
and
take
care
of
you
the
best
i
can
why
any
heaven
that
coming
to
us
simply
wo
be
in
it
not
for
me
he
looked
at
her
across
the
between
them
and
dropped
his
voice
to
add
but
you
would
of
course
i
would
dear
jim
she
cried
with
warm
impulsiveness
that
is
i
might
a
good
man
like
you
is
worth
a
worldful
of
money
and
furniture
i
do
live
for
those
things
as
you
seem
to
think
but
but
you
know
how
it
is
i
ca
change
about
from
one
to
another
he
dropped
the
saddest
no
into
the
pregnant
pause
no
deb
no
i
expected
that
staunch
through
everything
that
you
all
over
well
with
a
movement
as
if
to
pull
himself
together
staunch
too
we
equals
in
that
anyhow
and
do
you
forget
it
i
not
bother
you
any
more
i
never
have
bothered
you
have
i
but
i
here
when
you
want
me
body
and
soul
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
you
remember
that
stretching
his
horny
hand
across
to
her
and
being
in
the
same
instant
electrified
by
the
touch
of
her
lips
upon
it
oh
i
will
i
will
the
evening
post
brought
a
ship
letter
guthrie
carey
was
in
port
he
had
been
there
long
enough
to
hear
the
news
that
deborah
pennycuick
was
penniless
and
that
claud
dalzell
had
deserted
her
so
he
had
written
to
her
at
length
the
longest
letter
of
his
life
ten
pages
she
took
it
to
her
bedroom
and
sat
down
to
read
it
while
at
the
same
time
she
rested
a
little
before
dinner
she
had
frowned
over
the
envelope
now
she
smiled
over
the
first
pages
she
sighed
over
the
middle
ones
she
even
wept
a
little
over
the
last
then
she
wrote
out
an
answer
and
sent
it
by
a
groom
to
the
nearest
telegraph
office
please
do
not
come
am
writing
thus
she
cast
aside
in
one
day
three
good
men
and
true
to
one
who
was
not
worthy
to
be
ranked
with
any
of
them
but
that
is
the
way
of
love
chapter
xiv
there
was
an
attic
at
the
top
of
a
dark
flight
of
stairs
in
the
suburban
villa
that
was
now
the
sisters
home
it
contained
a
fireplace
and
a
long
dormer
window
three
square
casements
in
a
row
of
which
the
outer
pair
opened
like
doors
facing
the
morning
sun
and
a
country
landscape
the
previous
tenants
had
used
it
for
a
box
and
lumber
room
and
left
it
cobwebbed
filthy
and
asphyxiating
deb
ordered
a
charwoman
to
clean
it
and
a
man
to
distemper
the
grubby
plaster
and
stain
the
floor
and
then
laid
down
rugs
and
assembled
tables
and
books
and
and
girls
odds
and
ends
whereby
it
was
transformed
into
a
cosy
boudoir
and
their
favourite
room
hither
came
mary
when
she
could
escape
from
that
treadmill
of
which
she
never
spoke
bringing
her
boy
to
astonish
his
aunts
with
his
cleverness
and
astonishing
them
herself
with
the
heretical
notions
which
an
intimate
association
with
orthodoxy
seemed
to
have
implanted
in
her
but
bennet
was
not
admitted
nor
any
other
outsider
the
little
bricked
hearth
when
reminiscent
wood
fires
burned
on
it
was
a
pleasant
in
cold
weather
but
it
was
the
window
in
the
projecting
gable
towards
which
the
sisters
most
commonly
converged
it
was
about
eight
feet
long
by
two
feet
high
and
close
up
under
it
nearly
flush
with
its
sill
stood
a
substantial
table
the
chairs
at
either
end
comfortably
filling
the
rest
of
the
alcove
they
could
sit
here
to
write
or
sew
or
drink
afternoon
tea
and
look
out
upon
as
pleasant
a
rural
landscape
the
malvern
hills
as
any
suburban
villa
could
command
it
was
that
view
indeed
which
had
decided
deb
to
take
the
house
there
was
of
course
a
towny
foreground
to
it
and
this
it
was
rather
than
the
distant
blue
ranges
that
held
the
gaze
of
rose
pennycuick
when
she
looked
forth
the
of
the
villa
next
to
their
own
it
was
a
enclosure
spacious
and
and
amongst
its
appointments
displayed
a
platform
of
brickwork
slightly
raised
above
the
asphalted
ground
and
supporting
the
biggest
and
best
that
she
had
ever
seen
those
are
nice
people
she
remarked
for
they
have
given
their
dog
as
good
a
house
as
they
have
given
themselves
is
it
a
beauty
i
wish
to
goodness
everybody
was
as
considerate
for
the
poor
things
i
wonder
what
sort
of
a
dear
beast
it
is
she
watched
so
long
for
its
appearance
that
she
thought
the
kennel
untenanted
but
presently
saw
a
maid
come
out
from
the
kitchen
with
a
tin
dish
this
she
dumped
upon
the
brick
platform
turning
her
back
instantly
and
a
fine
ruffed
collie
stepped
over
the
kennel
threshold
to
get
his
dinner
chained
cried
rose
and
she
never
spoke
to
him
deb
looked
over
her
shoulder
sympathetically
concerned
is
he
really
what
a
shame
i
expect
they
are
too
awfully
clean
and
tidy
to
stand
a
dog
paws
on
anything
but
no
doubt
they
let
him
out
for
a
run
rose
waited
for
days
and
never
saw
this
happen
the
master
of
the
house
and
a
dapper
young
man
his
son
went
to
town
every
morning
at
a
certain
hour
evidently
for
the
day
business
a
stout
smart
lady
with
smart
daughters
was
seen
going
forth
in
the
afternoons
the
maids
took
their
little
outings
but
no
one
took
the
dog
he
lived
alone
on
his
patch
of
brick
either
hidden
in
the
kennel
or
lying
in
the
sun
with
his
nose
between
his
paws
he
had
his
food
regularly
for
it
was
a
regular
household
but
beyond
that
no
notice
seemed
taken
of
him
rose
worked
up
from
day
to
day
declared
at
last
that
she
could
not
stand
it
why
what
can
you
do
said
deb
he
is
their
dog
not
yours
oh
i
do
know
but
i
must
do
something
one
moonlight
night
she
heard
him
always
silent
and
supine
except
when
suspicious
persons
came
into
the
yard
baying
softly
to
himself
plainly
to
her
voicing
the
weariness
of
his
unhappy
life
she
sat
up
in
bed
and
listened
to
him
and
to
his
master
shouting
to
him
at
intervals
to
be
quiet
and
she
wept
with
sympathetic
grief
it
was
a
saturday
night
on
sunday
morning
she
excused
herself
from
going
to
church
she
saw
deb
and
francie
go
and
she
saw
the
family
of
the
next
house
go
heard
their
front
door
bang
and
caught
gleams
of
smart
dresses
through
the
foliage
of
their
front
garden
then
she
put
on
her
hat
and
stole
forth
to
intercede
for
the
collie
with
the
cook
of
his
establishment
a
person
who
had
once
been
observed
to
pat
his
head
the
gleaming
door
at
which
she
rang
with
a
determined
hand
but
a
fluttering
heart
was
to
her
dismay
opened
to
her
by
a
young
man
the
son
of
the
house
whom
she
had
seen
going
to
business
every
morning
tailored
beautifully
and
wearing
a
silk
hat
that
dazzled
one
he
was
now
in
a
very
old
suit
and
collarless
so
that
at
first
she
did
not
recognise
him
the
desire
of
each
was
to
turn
and
fly
but
the
necessity
upon
them
was
to
face
their
joint
mishap
and
see
it
through
crimson
the
young
man
mumbled
apologies
for
his
state
of
unreadiness
to
receive
ladies
equally
crimson
rose
begged
him
not
to
mention
it
and
apologised
for
her
own
untimely
call
miss
pennycuick
i
believe
stammered
he
with
an
awkward
bow
miss
rose
pennycuick
yes
said
she
struggling
through
her
overwhelming
embarrassment
i
called
i
wanted
i
i
might
i
speak
to
you
for
just
one
minute
mr
breen
she
had
lived
beside
him
long
enough
to
know
his
name
also
his
occupation
the
breens
were
drapers
their
shop
in
the
city
was
not
to
be
compared
with
buckley
nunn
or
robertson
moffat
but
it
was
a
good
shop
in
its
way
as
this
good
home
of
the
proprietors
testified
certainly
said
young
mr
breen
whose
name
was
peter
with
pleasure
by
all
means
walk
in
miss
pennycuick
she
walked
into
a
gorgeous
where
all
was
of
the
best
and
wore
that
shining
air
of
furniture
too
valuable
for
daily
use
mr
peter
drew
up
a
cream
linen
blind
that
was
one
mass
of
lace
insertion
and
apologised
anew
for
his
unseemly
costume
the
fact
is
miss
pennycuick
i
hope
you
wo
be
shocked
at
my
doing
such
things
on
sunday
i
was
cleaning
my
gun
there
is
a
holiday
this
week
and
i
am
going
shooting
with
a
friend
it
was
he
i
expected
to
see
when
i
went
to
the
door
in
this
state
oh
said
rose
more
at
her
ease
i
often
do
things
on
sundays
i
do
see
why
not
in
fact
i
am
doing
something
now
she
cast
about
for
words
wherein
to
explain
her
errand
while
he
shot
a
stealthy
glance
at
her
though
not
beautiful
like
deb
and
francie
she
was
a
wholesome
healthy
bonnie
creature
and
he
was
as
well
aware
of
her
position
in
life
as
she
was
of
his
i
came
mr
breen
i
thought
there
were
only
servants
in
the
house
i
am
sure
you
must
wonder
how
i
can
take
such
a
liberty
such
an
utter
stranger
but
i
wanted
to
speak
about
that
poor
dog
of
yours
bruce
ah
enlightenment
seemed
to
come
to
the
young
man
you
have
called
to
complain
of
the
row
he
made
last
night
we
were
only
saying
at
breakfast
no
no
indeed
rose
spread
out
protesting
hands
and
ceased
to
feel
embarrassed
not
to
complain
of
him
poor
dear
but
but
if
you
will
forgive
such
impertinence
to
ask
somebody
i
thought
i
should
see
your
cook
who
looks
kind
to
do
something
to
make
his
life
a
little
less
miserable
miserable
mr
breen
broke
in
and
sat
up
stiffening
as
if
half
inclined
to
be
offended
even
with
this
very
nice
young
lady
there
is
a
dog
in
the
country
better
off
we
had
his
place
in
the
yard
built
on
purpose
for
him
had
his
kennel
made
to
a
special
design
a
lovely
kennel
i
never
saw
a
better
clean
straw
every
few
days
all
his
food
cooked
but
chained
mr
breen
and
a
collie
too
well
we
could
have
him
messing
all
over
the
place
at
any
rate
my
people
would
oh
i
assure
you
miss
pennycuick
bruce
is
in
clover
he
was
only
baying
the
moon
dogs
often
do
that
it
only
their
fun
though
it
is
fun
to
us
fun
sighed
rose
helplessly
and
she
fixed
her
eyes
upon
her
companion
as
they
sat
on
the
edges
of
their
brocaded
chairs
with
no
sense
that
he
was
a
strange
young
man
a
gaze
that
troubled
and
disconcerted
him
i
am
sure
she
answered
earnestly
that
you
have
a
kind
heart
one
has
only
to
look
at
you
to
know
it
the
idea
never
occurred
to
me
before
he
mumbled
flattered
by
her
discernment
and
no
more
offended
with
her
i
am
sure
no
one
could
mean
better
by
a
dog
than
you
giving
him
all
those
nice
things
she
continued
but
but
you
do
think
you
try
to
imagine
yourself
chained
up
in
one
spot
night
and
day
week
in
and
week
out
with
nothing
to
do
no
interests
no
amusements
unable
to
get
to
your
work
to
go
shooting
with
your
friends
to
do
anything
that
you
were
born
to
do
and
consider
how
you
would
like
it
mr
peter
submitted
to
her
humbly
the
fact
that
he
was
not
a
dog
and
you
think
you
are
not
both
made
of
the
same
stuff
that
just
where
people
make
the
mistake
even
the
kindest
of
them
mr
breen
i
once
had
a
long
talk
with
the
curator
of
a
zoological
garden
and
he
told
me
that
animals
in
confinement
suffer
mentally
just
as
we
should
do
in
their
place
unless
they
have
occupation
and
companionship
they
go
out
of
their
minds
they
get
sullen
and
savage
and
people
say
they
are
vicious
and
punish
them
when
it
is
only
misery
he
said
no
happy
dog
ever
got
hydrophobia
unless
it
was
bitten
and
that
it
was
to
save
themselves
from
going
mad
that
squirrels
kept
whirling
their
wheel
and
tigers
running
round
and
round
their
cages
they
want
notice
and
change
and
work
or
they
can
not
bear
it
the
stagnation
kills
them
or
i
wish
it
did
kill
them
quicker
than
it
does
look
at
your
bruce
born
to
work
sheep
to
scamper
over
miles
of
country
free
as
air
to
be
mates
with
some
man
who
would
know
the
value
of
such
a
friend
and
be
worthy
of
him
oh
it
is
too
cruel
never
had
rose
displayed
such
eloquence
and
a
sudden
glisten
in
her
candid
eyes
put
the
piercing
climax
to
it
mr
peter
kind
heart
which
had
been
growing
softer
and
softer
with
every
word
she
spoke
was
in
melting
state
upon
my
soul
he
declared
you
put
quite
a
new
light
on
it
you
do
indeed
miss
pennycuick
i
see
your
point
of
view
exactly
but
with
the
utmost
willingness
to
meet
her
views
he
was
unable
to
see
how
to
do
it
it
was
easy
to
say
let
him
off
the
chain
but
the
mater
who
was
very
particular
would
never
stand
a
dog
muddying
the
verandahs
and
digging
holes
for
his
bones
in
the
he
mr
peter
was
an
only
son
and
she
would
do
most
things
for
him
but
he
was
afraid
she
would
draw
the
line
at
that
well
you
might
at
least
take
him
for
walks
rose
pleaded
nobody
could
object
to
that
yes
i
might
take
him
for
walks
the
young
man
conceded
thoughtfully
of
course
i
do
get
home
from
business
till
and
i
have
to
leave
directly
after
breakfast
our
pepper
when
we
go
to
town
takes
us
to
the
station
and
sees
us
off
and
you
are
not
at
business
on
saturday
afternoons
i
usually
play
tennis
or
something
on
saturday
afternoons
well
take
him
and
let
him
see
you
play
tennis
he
love
it
i
question
whether
my
club
would
but
see
here
miss
pennycuick
i
was
going
to
meet
some
lady
friends
this
afternoon
but
now
i
wo
i
will
take
him
for
a
walk
instead
and
i
get
up
in
the
mornings
and
give
him
a
run
before
breakfast
there
oh
how
kind
how
good
you
are
she
exclaimed
delightedly
not
at
all
he
returned
glowing
it
is
you
who
are
good
taking
all
this
trouble
about
us
i
am
only
ashamed
that
you
should
have
had
to
do
it
and
that
you
should
have
caught
me
in
this
state
another
blushing
reference
to
his
distressing
toilet
never
mind
your
state
she
consoled
him
sweetly
rising
from
her
chair
i
like
you
better
in
this
state
than
i
do
when
you
are
smart
i
thought
you
were
too
smart
to
to
condescend
to
trouble
yourself
about
a
poor
dog
i
am
sorry
you
had
such
a
bad
opinion
of
me
it
was
simply
the
thing
did
occur
to
me
until
you
mentioned
it
i
know
but
it
is
all
right
now
well
i
must
go
you
will
never
get
your
gun
cleaned
at
this
rate
bother
the
gun
this
is
better
than
i
mean
wo
you
take
a
glass
of
wine
she
declined
emphatically
and
with
haste
and
hurried
into
the
hall
he
opened
the
front
door
for
her
and
they
stood
together
for
a
moment
on
the
dustless
mathematically
laid
upon
verandah
boards
as
white
as
almonds
what
a
lovely
garden
remarked
rose
as
she
stepped
down
to
it
those
were
her
words
but
what
she
really
said
in
her
mind
was
who
would
think
he
was
a
draper
francie
was
aroused
from
her
sunday
afternoon
snooze
on
the
sofa
what
is
the
matter
with
that
dog
she
complained
pettishly
surely
after
howling
like
a
starved
dingo
all
night
be
quiet
pepper
one
of
you
is
enough
rose
terrier
was
up
and
fidgeting
with
pricked
ears
they
must
be
killing
him
cried
deb
lifting
her
handsome
head
from
her
book
oh
no
said
rose
that
sort
of
bark
means
joy
not
pain
poor
dear
beast
what
making
him
joyful
i
wonder
i
must
go
up
and
see
said
rose
who
had
carefully
refrained
from
mentioning
her
forenoon
proceedings
the
drowsy
pair
sank
back
upon
their
cushions
only
pepper
accompanied
her
to
the
attic
room
he
jumped
upon
the
window
seat
wriggling
and
yapping
and
they
looked
forth
together
from
the
open
casement
upon
the
spectacle
of
bruce
and
mr
peter
apparently
engaged
in
mortal
combat
the
collie
had
realised
that
he
was
off
the
chain
and
about
to
take
a
walk
and
was
expressing
himself
not
merely
in
frenzied
yells
but
in
acrobatic
feats
that
threatened
to
overwhelm
his
master
the
latter
with
a
cane
in
his
hand
and
a
flower
in
his
jumped
and
dodged
wildly
to
escape
the
leaping
mass
his
face
puckered
with
anxiety
for
the
results
of
his
experiment
pepper
delighted
comments
drew
his
eyes
upwards
and
he
made
shift
to
raise
his
hat
with
a
smile
that
was
instantly
and
generously
repaid
rose
nodded
and
waved
her
hand
and
peter
went
off
making
gestures
and
casting
backward
glances
at
her
until
he
was
a
mere
dot
upon
the
distant
road
with
another
dot
circling
around
him
dear
fellow
she
mused
when
he
was
out
of
sight
chapter
xv
bruce
went
unchained
within
limits
and
had
a
run
nearly
every
day
workmen
came
to
put
a
railing
and
gate
to
the
back
verandah
of
his
establishment
and
mrs
breen
kept
a
fidgety
watch
upon
his
movements
but
evidently
the
only
son
will
ruled
and
he
was
more
than
faithful
to
his
compact
with
rose
she
was
able
to
see
this
from
her
commanding
window
and
to
hear
it
from
bruce
mouth
and
day
by
day
her
heart
warmed
towards
bruce
master
many
were
the
friendly
smiles
and
salutes
that
passed
between
the
attic
window
and
the
breen
all
unknown
to
rose
sisters
they
were
walking
with
her
one
saturday
afternoon
when
they
met
mr
peter
and
the
collie
pepper
ran
forward
to
greet
bruce
and
they
sniffed
at
each
other
noses
and
wagged
their
respective
tails
in
a
friendly
way
deb
was
remarking
to
rose
that
their
pity
for
the
dog
had
been
quite
misplaced
when
a
bow
from
her
sister
and
a
lift
of
the
hat
by
the
young
man
caused
her
to
stop
short
and
raise
her
fine
brows
inquiringly
rose
i
i
spoke
to
him
one
day
explained
rose
pink
as
her
pinkest
namesake
about
bruce
who
bruce
that
bruce
his
dog
frances
came
running
up
rose
said
she
indignantly
did
you
bow
to
that
man
he
is
our
neighbour
next
door
mumbled
rose
i
know
that
so
is
the
but
is
that
a
reason
why
you
should
bow
to
him
do
you
know
who
those
people
are
they
are
perfectly
respectable
people
i
believe
said
rose
growing
restive
drapers
said
frances
witheringly
i
should
care
if
they
were
they
have
a
beautiful
dog
and
young
mr
breen
is
very
kind
to
him
and
i
i
thanked
him
for
it
oh
deb
was
that
necessary
my
dear
perhaps
not
but
i
did
well
be
careful
rosie
we
are
not
at
redford
now
you
know
girls
living
alone
and
going
about
in
public
places
and
that
sort
of
person
frances
broke
in
crossly
always
takes
advantage
of
a
little
notice
why
he
looked
at
you
as
if
you
were
friends
and
equals
rose
rose
turned
to
retort
again
but
feeling
the
weight
of
opinion
against
her
forbore
and
she
was
glad
she
had
never
mentioned
the
circumstances
under
which
she
had
made
poor
peter
breen
acquaintance
on
a
later
afternoon
she
was
in
the
attic
room
sewing
at
a
frock
for
robbie
goldsworthy
robert
pennycuick
after
the
grandfather
who
had
been
expected
to
leave
much
money
while
deb
and
frances
entertained
visitors
downstairs
old
keziah
had
brought
her
tea
and
cakes
and
she
had
had
a
pleasant
time
with
her
work
and
her
thoughts
and
her
view
of
bruce
and
his
premises
when
suddenly
frances
flounced
in
now
madam
exclaimed
the
irate
young
lady
we
have
to
thank
you
for
this
what
did
i
say
give
these
people
an
inch
and
they
will
take
an
ell
a
mile
indeed
if
they
can
get
it
what
people
inquired
rose
faintly
those
breen
people
those
drapers
they
have
had
the
cheek
to
come
and
call
on
us
to
call
and
leave
their
cards
and
third
wednesday
as
if
they
expected
us
to
call
back
again
who
came
mrs
and
miss
with
half
the
shop
upon
their
backs
debbie
deb
was
coming
in
behind
her
you
are
not
going
to
return
the
call
of
those
people
i
trust
oh
i
do
know
smiled
deb
easily
it
would
please
them
and
it
would
hurt
us
there
would
be
no
need
of
course
to
return
a
second
one
i
should
think
it
would
not
hurt
us
rose
spoke
up
to
behave
like
decent
people
i
never
heard
that
it
was
considered
high
breeding
and
fine
manners
to
snub
your
inferiors
if
they
are
your
inferiors
you
have
to
snub
them
said
frances
if
they
do
know
manners
themselves
a
very
gentle
snub
said
deb
we
are
not
going
to
be
rude
to
the
poor
things
we
will
call
once
that
is
i
will
in
a
few
months
time
after
all
it
was
hardly
their
fault
no
it
is
rose
fault
please
rose
in
future
be
so
good
as
to
consider
your
family
a
little
as
well
as
your
neighbours
dogs
rose
only
reply
was
to
start
the
and
drive
it
vehemently
but
her
heart
burned
within
her
evidently
peter
mother
and
sister
had
been
insulted
in
her
house
after
he
had
been
so
good
to
her
he
did
not
appear
in
the
yard
that
evening
and
next
day
when
he
did
his
face
was
turned
from
her
all
the
time
the
day
after
that
she
rattled
the
window
and
encouraged
pepper
to
bark
to
draw
the
young
man
attention
having
ready
for
him
a
smile
that
should
counteract
francie
frowns
if
smiles
could
do
it
but
again
he
took
no
notice
then
she
was
sure
that
his
feelings
had
been
hurt
mrs
and
miss
breen
had
returned
to
report
a
cool
reception
of
the
overtures
that
had
been
made
almost
certainly
at
his
instigation
had
probably
reproached
him
for
exposing
them
to
the
insolence
of
snobs
oh
it
was
horrid
and
doubtless
he
thought
her
as
bad
as
the
rest
she
had
not
gone
downstairs
to
see
his
mother
and
sister
and
how
was
he
to
know
she
had
been
ignorant
that
they
were
there
and
still
he
took
bruce
out
for
walks
before
breakfast
and
after
business
in
the
afternoons
when
he
might
have
been
playing
tennis
and
enjoying
himself
she
bore
with
this
state
of
things
for
some
time
then
suddenly
determined
to
end
it
where
there
a
will
there
a
way
one
of
deb
petticoats
showed
signs
of
fraying
and
she
must
have
fresh
lace
for
it
immediately
rose
offered
to
go
to
town
to
fetch
it
taking
with
her
the
money
for
her
purchase
never
before
had
she
been
to
breen
if
not
third
or
fourth
was
its
class
amongst
melbourne
shops
and
the
pennycuicks
had
always
been
accustomed
to
the
best
but
when
she
turned
in
at
the
somewhat
narrow
and
encumbered
doorway
she
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
note
how
far
the
shop
ran
back
and
how
and
busy
and
solidly
prosperous
it
seemed
he
was
there
not
to
her
great
relief
behind
the
counter
but
in
a
sort
of
raised
office
place
at
the
farther
end
attending
to
the
books
apparently
while
keeping
an
eye
upon
other
matters
hardly
had
she
set
foot
upon
the
carpeted
aisle
when
his
head
popped
up
from
behind
his
desk
and
she
saw
herself
recognised
as
it
was
her
object
to
be
recognised
and
to
speak
to
him
she
passed
the
lace
department
the
ribbons
the
silks
the
dress
stuffs
until
she
reached
the
manchester
department
where
they
sold
towels
and
and
beautiful
satin
in
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
here
she
halted
and
asked
sweetly
for
torchon
lace
all
the
way
had
peter
watched
her
but
with
his
head
down
as
if
wishing
to
hide
from
her
he
fancies
i
shall
be
ashamed
of
him
because
he
keeps
a
shop
thought
she
and
that
was
exactly
what
he
did
fancy
knowing
the
world
and
its
funny
little
inconsistent
social
ways
so
when
informed
that
she
had
left
the
lace
counter
far
behind
her
and
while
turning
to
retrace
her
steps
she
frankly
sought
his
eye
and
catching
it
bowed
and
smiled
with
all
the
friendliness
that
could
be
expressed
in
such
fashion
that
smile
drew
peter
out
but
still
he
came
with
a
bashful
and
hesitating
air
as
if
uncertain
of
his
reception
so
that
she
had
to
meet
him
with
bold
hand
extended
how
do
you
do
mr
breen
how
is
bruce
but
i
see
how
well
he
is
and
happy
thanks
to
you
i
am
so
sorry
i
did
not
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
your
mother
and
sister
when
they
were
so
kind
as
to
call
the
other
day
but
i
did
not
know
they
were
in
the
house
till
they
were
gone
he
glowed
with
joy
he
clasped
her
hand
with
a
vigour
that
made
it
tingle
for
a
minute
afterwards
i
was
sorry
too
he
said
my
old
mater
is
a
good
soul
i
think
you
and
she
i
wanted
her
to
see
you
another
time
perhaps
oh
i
hope
so
we
are
such
near
neighbours
she
was
ready
to
say
anything
that
would
make
him
feel
he
was
not
being
treated
as
a
shopman
and
did
you
have
your
day
shooting
were
you
successful
well
with
modest
pride
i
came
upon
snipe
unexpectedly
and
brought
home
a
couple
of
brace
if
i
had
thought
you
would
condescend
to
accept
them
miss
pennycuick
if
i
had
dared
oh
thank
you
very
much
but
i
could
not
have
let
you
rob
your
mother
conscious
of
heightened
colour
and
several
pairs
of
watching
eyes
rose
hastily
put
out
her
hand
peter
took
it
respectfully
slightly
abashed
can
i
is
there
anything
anything
i
can
do
for
you
yes
please
she
said
struggling
to
remember
what
it
was
some
er
lace
torchon
for
my
sister
that
is
what
i
came
for
this
way
said
peter
gently
and
they
walked
down
the
long
narrow
shop
together
closely
scrutinised
by
the
young
women
behind
the
counters
two
or
three
of
these
with
ingratiating
smirks
converged
upon
the
spot
where
their
young
chief
halted
and
called
aloud
for
torchon
lace
the
favoured
one
brought
forth
the
stock
unexpectedly
large
and
valuable
and
the
girl
was
soon
able
to
make
her
choice
she
wanted
one
dozen
yards
and
there
was
a
piece
of
fourteen
that
peter
styled
a
remnant
for
her
benefit
if
he
could
have
presented
it
to
her
free
of
cost
he
would
have
loved
to
do
so
as
it
was
she
made
an
excellent
bargain
i
only
hope
they
wo
ask
me
where
i
got
it
she
said
to
herself
on
the
way
home
happily
they
did
not
the
usual
buckley
was
taken
for
granted
and
deb
slashed
up
the
lace
without
noticing
that
she
had
fourteen
yards
for
twelve
but
rose
was
a
poor
schemer
and
it
was
inevitable
that
she
should
soon
be
found
out
the
sisters
were
gathered
about
their
window
table
in
the
attic
room
on
the
following
afternoon
keziah
had
brought
their
tea
and
amid
the
litter
of
their
needlework
they
drank
it
leisurely
enjoying
a
spell
of
rest
both
casements
stood
wide
deb
at
one
end
gazed
wistfully
at
the
malvern
hills
frances
at
the
other
looked
down
on
objects
nearer
home
rose
had
purposely
drawn
her
chair
back
farther
into
the
room
a
joyous
bark
arose
there
your
young
man
rose
said
frances
flippantly
really
the
dandy
has
surpassed
himself
knickerbockers
and
a
norfolk
jacket
if
you
please
why
actually
a
horse
he
is
going
out
to
ride
this
it
is
to
be
a
in
these
levelling
times
he
is
not
a
said
reckless
rose
how
do
you
know
returned
frances
swiftly
proprietors
do
wait
behind
the
counter
that
is
where
he
has
had
to
learn
his
business
of
course
said
deb
but
there
is
nothing
disgraceful
in
counters
do
be
snobbish
francie
every
trade
profession
too
for
that
matter
has
to
have
a
counter
of
some
sort
of
course
it
has
said
rose
heartened
oh
but
to
see
a
man
a
miserable
apology
for
a
man
measuring
out
calicoes
and
ribbons
and
tapes
and
buttons
and
stays
and
garters
and
all
sorts
of
things
that
a
man
has
no
right
to
touch
pugh
only
women
sell
the
stays
and
garters
corrected
rose
vehemently
and
at
least
young
mr
breen
is
not
a
miserable
apology
for
a
man
he
is
as
much
a
real
man
as
anybody
else
goes
out
shooting
plays
tennis
again
francie
pounced
on
her
how
do
you
know
why
why
you
can
see
he
is
one
of
that
sort
squirmed
poor
rose
oh
said
frances
significantly
with
a
firm
stare
at
her
scarlet
face
deb
there
is
more
in
this
than
meets
the
eye
even
than
meets
the
eye
i
do
care
what
you
say
struck
rose
blindly
do
tease
her
deb
interposed
and
do
be
putting
preposterous
ideas
into
the
child
head
please
deb
i
am
not
a
child
no
my
dear
you
are
not
and
therefore
you
know
as
well
as
we
do
that
young
mr
breen
is
nothing
to
us
did
i
say
he
was
anything
it
is
francie
that
makes
horrid
vulgar
insinuations
but
how
do
you
know
that
he
shoots
and
plays
tennis
persisted
frances
with
a
darkling
smile
because
he
told
me
so
there
in
five
minutes
the
inquisitor
had
drawn
forth
the
whole
innocent
tale
she
fell
back
in
her
chair
while
deb
seemed
to
congeal
slowly
oh
moaned
frances
no
wonder
they
thought
they
could
come
and
call
and
make
friends
with
us
and
no
wonder
she
added
more
viciously
that
there
he
stands
leering
up
at
this
window
when
his
horse
has
been
ready
this
half
hour
is
he
doing
that
asked
deb
quickly
look
at
him
deb
rose
and
looked
then
with
a
firm
hand
closed
the
two
little
windows
and
drew
down
the
blinds
with
a
sob
of
rage
rose
jumped
from
her
almost
flung
her
cup
and
saucer
upon
the
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
thereupon
the
little
family
resolved
itself
into
a
strong
government
and
one
rebel
when
i
do
want
to
marry
a
shopkeeper
said
weeping
rose
to
her
sisters
then
it
will
be
time
enough
to
make
yourselves
ridiculous
but
they
thought
not
no
use
said
they
to
shut
the
stable
door
after
the
steed
is
stolen
danger
or
the
beginning
of
danger
had
distinctly
declared
itself
and
it
was
their
part
to
guard
the
threatened
point
so
they
took
steps
to
guard
it
the
name
of
breen
was
not
mentioned
but
its
flavour
lurked
in
every
mouthful
of
conversation
like
the
taste
of
garlic
that
has
been
rubbed
round
the
salad
bowl
in
the
salad
that
has
not
touched
it
it
filled
the
domestic
atmosphere
with
a
subtle
acrimoniousness
unknown
to
it
before
and
rose
was
watched
not
openly
but
systematically
enough
for
her
to
know
it
never
allowed
to
go
out
alone
or
to
sit
in
the
attic
after
a
certain
hour
driven
into
brooding
loneliness
and
disaffection
in
other
words
towards
her
instead
of
from
him
chapter
xvi
now
that
she
could
no
longer
entertain
deb
refused
to
be
entertained
much
to
the
discontent
of
frances
who
pined
continually
for
a
larger
and
brighter
life
so
that
the
invitations
fell
off
to
nothing
before
the
excuse
of
the
deep
mourning
was
worn
out
but
when
mrs
urquhart
always
maternally
solicitous
for
her
poor
sally
girls
wrote
to
beg
them
to
spend
christmas
at
five
creeks
deb
and
frances
who
did
not
for
different
reasons
wish
to
go
themselves
agreed
that
it
would
be
very
thing
for
rose
to
do
so
she
would
be
absolutely
safe
up
there
and
with
her
old
social
world
about
her
and
old
interests
to
occupy
her
mind
would
recover
that
respect
for
herself
which
seemed
to
have
been
more
or
less
impaired
by
association
with
suburban
villadom
they
hoped
she
would
stay
at
five
creeks
a
long
long
time
and
if
only
jim
would
keep
her
altogether
sighed
frances
i
would
be
content
with
jim
now
i
wish
to
goodness
he
would
said
deb
with
fervour
not
thinking
particularly
of
her
sister
as
she
spoke
the
matter
was
put
to
rose
and
she
consented
to
go
five
creeks
was
better
than
lorne
which
had
been
spoken
of
and
the
companionship
of
alice
than
the
shepherding
sisters
in
the
close
limits
of
seaside
lodgings
besides
rose
was
a
born
bush
girl
she
was
tenderly
escorted
to
spencer
street
and
put
into
the
hands
of
jim
himself
in
town
on
station
business
alice
met
them
at
the
other
end
and
the
two
friends
slept
or
rather
bunked
together
the
house
being
full
for
the
christmas
dance
and
talked
the
night
through
but
not
a
word
about
peter
breen
passed
rose
lips
so
full
of
words
as
they
were
next
day
the
and
chinese
lanterns
the
sandwiches
and
creams
and
what
not
occupied
her
every
moment
and
thought
until
it
was
time
to
dress
when
the
interest
of
the
ball
itself
became
supreme
well
there
one
good
thing
said
alice
as
hemmed
into
a
corner
of
a
small
room
crowded
with
girls
she
laced
rose
bodice
we
shall
not
want
for
men
there
be
one
to
each
girl
and
three
over
the
simpsons
alone
have
promised
to
bring
six
the
simpsons
were
new
people
at
bundaboo
which
mr
thornycroft
had
let
he
now
lived
at
redford
in
a
third
part
of
the
great
house
the
other
being
closed
he
was
not
coming
to
the
ball
alice
said
getting
too
old
for
balls
in
their
white
frocks
and
flowers
the
friends
went
to
the
and
in
the
thick
of
the
arrivals
jim
brought
up
from
the
bachelors
quarters
the
six
bundaboo
young
men
mrs
simpson
introduced
them
to
mrs
urquhart
and
her
bevy
of
assistant
hostesses
mr
leader
mr
henry
leader
down
from
queensland
mr
parkinson
english
my
two
sons
whom
you
know
my
nephew
mr
breen
thus
do
the
sportive
fates
love
to
make
mock
of
the
most
family
plans
rose
and
peter
faced
each
other
sharing
one
blush
between
them
their
natural
pleasure
and
astonishment
was
only
equalled
by
their
mutual
admiration
what
a
little
love
she
is
in
that
pretty
gown
thought
he
a
connoisseur
in
gowns
and
who
would
take
him
for
a
draper
now
thought
she
noting
the
vigorous
frame
and
the
perfect
correctness
of
its
garb
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
one
did
take
him
for
a
draper
and
no
one
cared
what
he
was
since
he
was
mrs
simpson
nephew
and
a
man
as
soon
as
it
was
understood
that
a
previous
acquaintanceship
existed
between
them
rose
was
given
peter
to
take
care
of
to
show
round
and
introduce
they
walked
off
elated
well
i
never
expected
to
see
you
here
said
she
nor
i
you
said
he
i
thought
i
was
never
going
to
see
you
any
more
how
is
your
mother
how
is
dear
bruce
will
anyone
take
him
for
walks
while
you
are
away
how
terribly
he
will
miss
you
well
it
is
something
to
be
missed
even
by
a
dog
what
a
nice
face
your
aunt
has
is
she
your
father
no
my
mother
they
are
very
much
alike
but
you
do
know
my
mother
the
blessed
urquhart
children
romped
up
to
them
at
this
opportune
moment
thrusting
forward
their
basket
of
programmes
rose
and
peter
each
took
a
card
and
peter
proceeded
to
business
with
pleasure
said
rose
and
then
oh
if
you
like
well
only
one
more
round
one
i
belong
to
the
house
and
must
distribute
myself
no
no
that
enough
leave
room
for
all
the
nice
girls
i
am
going
to
introduce
you
to
miss
alice
urquhart
mr
breen
dear
mrs
simpson
nephew
and
a
friend
of
mine
in
town
it
slipped
out
unawares
peter
air
as
he
scribbled
miss
urquhart
on
his
card
was
seraphic
later
alice
snatched
a
chance
to
whisper
to
rose
what
a
fellow
who
is
he
and
rose
hastened
to
explain
that
she
knew
him
only
very
slightly
they
had
their
first
waltz
together
and
he
danced
delightfully
this
was
a
fresh
agreeable
surprise
to
rose
as
if
drapers
did
not
take
dancing
lessons
and
make
use
of
them
like
other
people
she
was
almost
indiscreet
in
her
eulogies
on
his
performance
but
there
was
not
room
for
all
or
half
or
a
quarter
to
dance
at
once
and
the
crowded
house
was
hot
and
the
night
outside
soft
dry
delicious
and
the
five
creeks
garden
was
simply
made
to
be
sat
out
in
so
presently
rose
and
peter
found
themselves
leaning
over
a
gate
at
the
end
of
a
long
sequestered
path
that
said
rose
nodding
towards
open
paddock
is
the
boys
cricket
ground
they
play
matches
in
the
holidays
with
the
stations
round
that
fence
leads
to
alice
yes
said
peter
but
now
look
here
miss
rose
tell
me
straight
and
true
am
i
to
understand
that
my
position
in
life
makes
me
unfit
to
associate
with
you
what
nonsense
she
protested
scarlet
in
the
darkness
what
utter
stuff
i
am
in
retail
trade
confessed
peter
mournfully
and
lots
of
people
think
that
awful
why
even
the
bookmakers
and
jew
usurers
look
down
on
us
not
that
i
care
a
straw
i
should
think
not
except
when
it
comes
to
your
family
what
does
it
matter
about
my
family
when
i
ah
do
you
do
you
forgive
me
for
being
a
shopkeeper
as
if
i
ever
thought
of
it
mocked
rose
which
was
disingenuous
of
her
i
do
mind
what
anybody
is
if
he
nice
himself
do
you
think
i
nice
i
am
not
going
to
pander
to
such
egregious
vanity
do
you
think
i
am
a
gentleman
do
i
pass
for
one
say
in
a
house
like
this
i
am
not
going
to
answer
any
more
of
those
horrid
indelicate
unnecessary
questions
ah
i
see
you
do
i
do
she
flamed
out
indignant
with
him
you
know
i
do
would
i
if
i
did
her
mouth
was
stopped
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
it
happened
before
either
of
them
knew
it
he
was
carried
away
and
she
was
overwhelmed
an
earthquake
could
not
have
given
them
a
greater
shock
forgive
me
he
muttered
tremulously
when
it
was
too
late
i
know
i
ought
to
have
but
i
could
help
it
you
are
not
angry
it
was
dashed
impudence
but
oh
i
say
we
shall
never
get
such
a
chance
as
this
again
could
you
do
you
think
put
up
with
me
could
you
i
have
loved
you
ever
since
that
dear
morning
that
you
came
about
bruce
could
you
try
to
care
for
me
a
little
bit
i
give
up
the
business
if
you
wished
and
go
into
something
else
if
you
mention
that
blessed
business
again
laughed
rose
hysterically
i
wo
speak
to
you
any
more
i
wo
i
wo
he
promised
a
joyful
ring
in
his
young
voice
as
long
as
you
do
mind
and
of
course
i
would
like
to
disappoint
the
old
pater
and
thank
god
there
plenty
of
money
to
make
you
comfortable
wherever
you
like
to
live
yes
yes
i
know
it
awful
cheek
i
no
business
to
count
chickens
like
this
but
here
we
are
face
to
face
at
last
no
one
to
keep
me
from
speaking
to
you
and
oh
darling
it
must
be
time
for
the
next
dance
and
i
engaged
for
it
then
go
go
she
urged
the
one
after
this
is
ours
and
i
will
wait
here
for
you
till
you
come
back
it
is
only
jim
and
he
does
matter
i
must
be
alone
to
think
to
make
up
my
mind
you
angel
for
he
knew
what
that
meant
off
he
went
to
get
through
his
duty
dance
as
best
he
could
rose
stayed
behind
dodging
amongst
the
bushes
to
hide
her
white
dress
deaf
to
jim
strident
calls
and
then
presently
the
lovers
flitted
out
of
the
gate
across
the
boys
cricket
ground
and
down
the
bank
of
one
of
the
five
creeks
where
rose
knew
of
a
nice
seat
beyond
the
area
of
possible
disturbance
as
they
sat
down
on
it
together
they
leaned
inwards
her
head
drooping
to
his
shoulder
and
his
arm
sliding
round
her
waist
in
the
most
natural
way
in
the
world
then
silence
packed
full
beyond
in
the
moonlit
waste
curlews
wailing
sweetly
behind
a
piano
barely
audible
from
the
humming
house
what
the
matter
asked
alice
urquhart
when
her
bedfellow
broke
out
crying
suddenly
for
no
reason
that
appeared
oh
i
do
know
cackled
rose
i
am
upset
with
all
this
this
what
has
upset
you
aha
i
saw
you
and
that
young
mr
breen
making
off
into
the
garden
you
been
having
a
proposal
i
suppose
yes
sobbed
rose
between
two
foolish
laughs
and
forthwith
poured
out
the
whole
story
to
her
bosom
friend
she
and
peter
had
decided
not
to
disclose
it
to
a
soul
until
further
consideration
but
she
was
so
full
that
a
touch
caused
her
to
run
over
miss
urquhart
feelings
when
she
realised
the
fact
that
one
of
the
pennycuicks
was
committed
to
marry
a
draper
expressed
themselves
at
first
in
a
rather
chilling
silence
but
subsequently
having
reviewed
the
situation
from
its
several
sides
and
weighed
the
pros
and
cons
she
decided
to
assist
her
friend
to
make
the
best
of
it
as
against
all
potential
enemies
of
course
they
will
be
as
mad
as
so
many
march
hares
said
alice
referring
to
the
other
pennycuicks
but
after
all
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
what
is
there
in
a
draper
shop
any
more
than
in
a
warehouse
and
that
quite
aristocratic
if
it
big
enough
trade
is
trade
and
why
we
should
make
chalk
of
one
and
cheese
of
another
passes
me
oh
you
only
got
to
be
rich
nowadays
to
be
received
anywhere
these
breens
seem
well
off
and
anyway
there
are
the
simpsons
they
are
all
right
solid
comfort
my
dear
is
not
to
be
despised
especially
when
a
girl
ca
pick
and
choose
and
may
possibly
never
get
another
chance
he
is
awfully
presentable
too
and
most
gentlemanly
i
am
sure
oh
on
the
whole
if
you
ask
me
i
say
stick
to
him
alice
voice
was
sad
and
she
sighed
inwardly
i
going
to
stick
to
him
said
rose
well
you
may
count
on
me
i
get
them
all
asked
here
for
a
picnic
and
we
go
over
to
bundaboo
to
invite
them
tomorrow
mrs
simpson
said
he
was
only
with
her
for
a
few
days
you
darling
and
if
i
were
in
your
place
rose
i
marry
him
just
as
soon
as
he
wanted
me
to
i
walk
out
and
get
it
done
quietly
and
tell
them
afterwards
it
would
save
a
lot
of
unpleasantness
and
it
force
the
hostile
clans
to
try
and
make
one
family
when
they
never
could
i
do
see
why
they
could
mrs
simpson
is
his
mother
sister
oh
well
we
shall
see
i
do
know
about
deb
and
mary
but
france
can
be
all
sorts
of
a
cat
when
the
fit
takes
her
and
as
she
is
certain
to
oppose
it
to
the
bitter
end
she
will
never
have
done
irritating
his
people
and
setting
everybody
at
loggerheads
however
never
mind
that
now
she
enveloped
rose
in
a
comforting
embrace
we
just
enjoy
ourselves
while
we
can
and
until
we
must
start
the
fuss
with
the
girls
at
home
we
keep
things
dark
shall
we
just
you
and
i
and
he
you
can
tell
him
when
you
see
him
tomorrow
that
i
am
his
friend
i
will
i
will
and
he
will
adore
you
for
your
goodness
alice
with
still
no
lover
of
her
own
was
pleased
with
this
prospect
and
so
rose
had
a
heavenly
time
for
a
week
or
two
peter
extending
his
visit
to
match
hers
and
went
home
within
a
day
of
him
in
good
heart
for
the
inevitable
struggle
chapter
xvii
the
starting
of
the
fuss
was
thus
described
by
the
starter
in
her
first
letter
to
her
friend
oh
my
dear
it
is
simply
awful
there
is
not
a
scrap
of
hope
dear
old
deb
is
the
worst
because
she
cries
fancy
deb
crying
i
do
care
what
francie
says
and
does
only
if
she
were
not
my
sister
i
would
never
speak
to
her
again
even
mary
is
antagonistic
though
i
believe
she
would
be
if
it
were
not
for
that
insufferable
husband
of
hers
he
thinks
himself
and
puts
it
into
her
head
that
we
are
all
going
to
fall
into
the
bottomless
pit
if
we
let
trade
into
the
family
as
if
and
more
of
the
aristocracy
of
the
country
were
not
traders
and
my
peter
is
as
good
as
her
parson
any
day
but
i
do
care
except
for
deb
i
do
hate
her
to
have
to
cry
through
me
and
to
be
so
kind
at
the
same
time
she
scolds
francie
for
being
horrid
that
does
no
good
she
says
and
she
is
quite
right
and
then
asks
me
if
i
have
any
love
left
for
her
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
it
makes
me
feel
like
a
selfish
brute
and
yet
it
would
not
be
unselfish
to
sacrifice
peter
really
i
am
quite
distracted
i
have
hardly
slept
a
wink
since
i
came
back
further
details
followed
i
did
not
know
until
i
got
a
letter
from
him
by
the
gardener
that
peter
came
this
morning
to
call
the
call
and
was
not
let
in
keziah
had
been
got
at
you
must
know
and
works
against
us
the
old
liar
told
him
under
instructions
of
course
that
none
of
us
was
at
home
she
that
goes
to
church
every
sunday
and
pretends
to
be
so
pious
old
hypocrite
well
as
i
was
reading
peter
letter
the
rings
and
who
should
it
be
but
old
daddy
breen
coming
to
demand
what
we
mean
by
it
snubbing
his
precious
son
whom
he
thinks
good
enough
for
a
princess
and
so
he
is
he
was
not
going
to
be
turned
from
the
door
not
he
and
presently
i
heard
him
and
deb
at
it
hammer
and
tongs
in
the
and
she
came
up
to
me
afterwards
simply
in
flames
she
was
wild
my
dear
she
has
left
off
crying
and
started
to
fight
papa
breen
i
am
afraid
he
is
a
bit
bumptious
for
what
she
calls
his
class
in
life
turned
the
scale
and
now
she
is
as
implacable
as
francie
she
says
she
will
not
have
the
house
of
pennycuick
disgraced
or
words
to
that
effect
while
she
is
alive
to
prevent
it
and
when
i
ask
her
to
be
just
to
peter
who
is
no
more
answerable
for
his
family
than
i
am
for
mine
and
not
to
judge
him
before
she
knows
a
scrap
about
him
she
simply
looks
at
me
as
if
she
itched
to
box
my
ears
is
it
too
hard
other
girls
have
such
a
lovely
time
when
they
are
engaged
everybody
considering
them
and
giving
them
opportunities
to
be
together
there
not
going
to
be
anything
of
that
sort
for
us
i
can
plainly
see
well
i
shall
not
give
him
up
so
they
need
not
think
it
i
have
seen
my
poor
old
boy
he
was
much
cut
up
but
feels
better
now
he
asked
me
to
go
and
see
his
mother
the
moment
i
walked
in
and
he
said
here
she
is
the
darling
opened
her
arms
and
we
just
hugged
as
if
i
was
her
daughter
already
there
is
nobody
like
mothers
papa
breen
came
home
while
i
was
there
i
thought
he
was
going
to
be
aggrieved
but
he
was
not
with
me
if
it
is
not
a
snobbish
thing
to
say
he
is
rather
proud
of
his
son
choice
he
was
a
bit
too
fussy
and
outspoken
and
dear
peter
got
the
fidgets
wondering
what
he
would
say
next
but
i
did
not
mind
he
talked
about
building
us
a
house
but
peter
whispered
to
me
that
that
would
take
too
long
and
that
already
he
had
one
in
his
eye
i
know
it
a
lovely
place
with
the
prettiest
grounds
and
stables
and
and
all
nothing
is
too
good
for
me
i
tried
to
pacify
the
girls
by
telling
them
i
should
have
a
comfortable
home
but
they
seem
to
think
that
the
vulgarest
feature
of
the
whole
affair
it
may
be
but
it
nice
would
you
condescend
to
come
and
stay
with
a
draper
wife
sometimes
we
are
going
to
have
bruce
to
live
with
us
then
i
made
peter
come
home
with
me
and
i
took
him
in
myself
to
see
deb
he
behaved
as
nicely
as
possible
but
it
was
no
use
is
of
age
mr
breen
says
deb
with
that
look
of
hers
will
do
as
she
chooses
but
she
will
never
do
this
with
my
consent
and
i
feel
i
never
shall
papa
breen
sticks
in
her
throat
if
only
she
had
seen
peter
before
his
father
came
and
not
after
but
i
daresay
it
would
have
been
the
same
they
are
too
eaten
up
with
their
prejudices
to
begin
to
know
him
it
is
quite
hopeless
here
i
live
in
my
own
home
without
a
friend
and
he
is
treated
like
a
pariah
my
poor
dear
boy
he
has
been
to
see
me
two
or
three
times
as
he
has
a
perfect
right
to
do
and
they
have
just
had
him
shown
into
the
and
left
him
to
me
neither
of
them
coming
near
and
this
while
bennet
goldsworthy
loafs
all
over
the
house
as
if
it
was
his
own
and
presumes
to
look
at
me
in
a
superior
sort
of
way
as
if
i
was
one
of
his
dirty
little
children
in
disgrace
they
bring
him
up
into
the
attic
even
our
own
private
room
mine
as
much
as
theirs
they
never
did
it
before
and
it
is
only
because
he
is
banded
with
them
against
me
well
i
would
marry
bennet
goldsworthy
if
there
was
not
another
man
in
the
world
i
have
my
ring
such
diamonds
too
valuable
i
tell
peter
but
he
says
nothing
can
be
that
and
i
know
they
ca
help
seeing
it
because
the
whole
room
flashes
when
i
turn
it
this
way
and
that
like
blue
lightning
playing
but
they
all
pretend
not
to
since
they
find
they
can
not
break
our
engagement
the
idea
is
to
ignore
it
as
if
it
was
something
so
low
as
to
be
beneath
their
notice
perhaps
they
fancy
that
will
wear
me
out
but
it
wo
if
they
had
been
nice
and
pleaded
with
me
and
if
peter
had
not
been
so
very
dear
and
good
i
might
have
caved
in
but
not
now
and
indeed
i
am
sure
i
never
should
anyway
only
we
might
have
agreed
to
differ
without
quarrelling
which
we
never
did
before
oh
it
is
too
miserable
poor
mr
and
mrs
breen
must
hate
the
very
name
of
pennycuick
and
they
will
end
by
hating
me
if
this
goes
on
peter
has
bought
the
house
and
is
asking
me
to
hurry
our
marriage
to
get
me
out
of
it
he
says
a
private
ceremony
would
not
be
dishonourable
under
the
circumstances
it
seems
to
me
a
mean
sort
of
way
to
go
to
him
but
what
do
you
think
my
dear
wrote
alice
urquhart
i
think
peter
is
right
next
time
he
asks
you
you
say
yes
it
will
be
a
real
kindness
to
both
families
who
would
never
know
what
to
do
with
a
house
wedding
besides
then
you
might
have
to
be
given
away
by
walk
out
quietly
and
unbeknown
and
do
come
back
write
from
the
blue
mountains
or
somewhere
ever
rose
breen
and
later
on
when
things
have
settled
down
their
hearts
will
melt
and
they
will
come
and
see
you
let
me
know
what
day
and
i
will
run
down
to
the
dentist
to
see
fair
play
and
sign
the
register
now
you
need
not
have
any
scruples
child
because
the
whole
of
your
husband
family
approve
of
the
match
simpsons
delighted
if
a
little
huffy
for
the
moment
to
see
solid
worth
looked
down
upon
and
deb
and
the
others
are
certain
to
come
round
when
they
find
it
is
no
use
doing
anything
else
outsiders
do
matter
and
i
should
hate
touting
for
wedding
presents
in
such
a
mixed
concern
as
for
your
clothes
you
have
plenty
when
you
want
more
you
can
get
them
cost
price
at
the
shop
it
is
a
very
good
shop
i
hear
and
i
mean
to
be
a
steady
customer
from
this
out
oh

and
i
will
come
and
see
you
old
girl
nows
and
thens
when
i
have
to
go
to
town
and
you
and
peter
must
spend
all
your
christmases
up
here
while
he
is
seeing
his
people
at
bundaboo
you
can
camp
with
me
like
old
times
at
the
last
moment
rose
broke
down
and
wept
upon
the
breast
of
her
favourite
sister
in
the
act
of
bidding
her
goodbye
perhaps
because
frances
chanced
to
be
absent
at
the
time
oh
debbie
darling
i
wo
deceive
you
i
am
not
going
shopping
i
am
going
into
melbourne
to
get
married
to
get
married
quietly
and
have
done
with
it
so
as
not
to
be
a
nuisance
to
you
any
more
married
gasped
deb
holding
the
agitated
creature
at
what
now
and
you
spring
this
on
us
without
a
word
of
warning
what
was
the
use
deb
you
know
what
you
would
have
said
i
have
got
to
have
him
dear
i
really
have
and
this
seemed
the
only
way
where
is
he
waiting
till
i
ready
they
have
a
carriage
outside
his
mother
and
sister
are
going
with
us
his
father
will
join
us
when
we
get
there
and
alice
urquhart
who
is
in
town
and
one
of
his
cousins
from
bundaboo
quite
respectable
and
you
see
only
very
quiet
so
as
not
to
trouble
you
and
the
girls
and
poor
dear
bennet
goldsworthy
more
than
we
can
help
not
trouble
us
broke
in
deb
her
face
that
had
paled
a
moment
ago
flaming
scarlet
rose
in
your
wildest
aberrations
i
did
not
credit
you
with
being
capable
of
humiliating
us
to
this
extent
ah
you
always
say
that
if
you
only
knew
him
but
some
day
you
will
and
then
you
will
wonder
how
you
could
have
set
yourself
against
us
so
i
ca
help
it
deb
i
did
it
for
the
best
marry
him
i
must
and
will
and
i
am
only
trying
to
do
it
in
a
way
as
inoffensive
to
you
as
possible
you
call
this
an
inoffensive
way
but
those
people
can
not
be
expected
to
know
they
can
they
do
do
insult
them
any
more
they
are
giving
me
everything
they
can
think
of
to
make
me
happy
and
here
i
have
no
home
no
love
no
sympathy
from
anybody
tears
gushed
from
her
eyes
and
deb
as
from
the
same
spring
they
were
instantly
locked
in
each
other
arms
poor
little
rosie
poor
dear
child
but
you
do
understand
pet
you
do
know
what
you
are
doing
going
right
out
of
your
class
out
of
your
world
but
to
a
good
husband
debbie
and
the
man
i
love
and
that
first
of
all
and
i
must
go
to
him
now
i
must
not
keep
him
waiting
bless
you
dearest
i
am
happy
now
never
mind
the
others
you
can
tell
them
after
i
gone
but
i
felt
that
i
must
speak
to
you
before
i
went
oh
i
am
so
glad
i
did
goodbye
darling
i
must
go
you
must
not
go
said
deb
swallowing
her
tears
and
resuming
her
imperious
air
not
this
way
rose
as
if
your
family
had
cast
you
off
how
can
you
treat
us
so
child
but
perhaps
we
deserve
it
only
you
do
see
what
you
are
doing
as
clearly
as
we
do
deb
deb
do
stop
me
they
are
waiting
it
is
late
now
the
pale
with
fright
struggled
in
her
sister
strong
hands
which
held
her
fast
where
is
mr
breen
demanded
deb
waiting
at
his
house
waiting
for
me
i
must
send
for
him
oh
deb
not
now
when
everything
is
settled
and
they
have
had
all
the
expense
and
trouble
will
you
fetch
him
rose
if
i
let
you
go
for
one
minute
only
no
i
wo
stop
it
i
ca
of
course
but
i
must
go
with
you
rose
i
must
oh
debbie
would
you
oh
how
i
wish
i
had
known
before
yes
run
and
bring
him
we
must
drive
faster
that
all
oh
deb
how
happy
this
will
make
us
but
run
away
and
fetch
him
ask
him
with
my
compliments
if
he
will
be
so
good
and
i
will
get
my
hat
on
while
you
are
gone
how
she
managed
it
was
a
mystery
but
by
the
time
the
bridegroom
appeared
deb
was
in
her
best
walking
costume
hatted
and
veiled
with
a
pair
of
new
gloves
in
her
hand
mr
breen
said
she
grave
and
stately
i
am
going
to
ask
a
favour
of
you
allow
me
to
take
my
sister
to
the
church
and
give
her
away
peter
was
naturally
flurried
besides
being
a
trifle
overawed
he
mumbled
something
to
the
effect
that
he
was
sure
his
family
would
be
quite
agreeable
and
that
his
sister
would
give
up
her
place
in
the
carriage
and
go
by
train
and
deb
facing
him
with
the
air
of
a
duchess
thought
how
thoroughly
shoppy
his
manner
was
his
splendid
new
clothes
helped
to
give
her
that
impression
fine
dressing
was
one
of
the
breens
trifling
errors
of
taste
as
drapers
which
damned
them
in
her
eyes
but
what
would
she
have
thought
if
he
had
not
done
all
honour
to
his
bride
in
this
respect
we
will
go
by
train
said
she
decisively
i
have
already
delayed
you
a
little
and
you
must
be
there
first
the
train
will
be
quicker
than
driving
so
that
we
shall
be
quite
in
time
she
smiled
as
she
caught
his
swift
glance
of
alarm
at
rose
no
i
am
not
going
to
kidnap
her
i
only
wish
to
observe
the
proprieties
a
little
for
her
sake
if
the
proprieties
have
not
been
observed
retorted
peter
suddenly
bold
it
has
not
been
all
my
fault
miss
pennycuick
perhaps
not
she
said
gently
for
she
was
a
generous
woman
perhaps
not
at
any
rate
holding
out
her
hand
we
must
let
bygones
be
bygones
now
be
good
to
her
that
is
all
i
ask
peter
seized
her
hand
in
his
superfine
glove
and
wrung
it
emotionally
while
rose
embraced
her
sister
left
arm
and
kissed
her
sleeve
then
after
a
hurried
consultation
of
timetables
the
bridegroom
retired
and
was
presently
seen
to
clatter
past
the
house
in
the
bridal
carriage
which
had
white
horses
to
it
to
deb
disgust
she
and
rose
talked
little
on
their
journey
rose
was
questioned
about
clothes
and
and
asked
whether
she
had
a
safe
pocket
anywhere
on
rose
answering
that
she
had
deb
pressed
into
it
a
closed
envelope
which
she
charged
her
sister
not
to
open
until
away
on
her
honeymoon
rose
disobeyed
the
order
and
found
a
hastily
scrawled
cheque
for
one
hundred
pounds
money
which
she
knew
could
ill
be
spared
oh
you
darling
she
murmured
fondly
but
i
wo
take
it
deb
i
wo
it
would
leave
you
poor
for
years
while
i
shall
have
heaps
of
everything
if
you
do
broke
in
deb
tragically
stern
and
determined
if
you
do
take
it
and
buy
your
first
clothes
with
it
i
will
never
forgive
you
as
long
as
i
live
child
do
you
see
rose
saw
this
much
deb
horror
of
the
thought
of
being
beholden
to
the
breens
for
a
trousseau
reluctantly
she
pocketed
the
gift
but
i
shall
never
want
it
you
know
i
do
care
about
that
said
deb
the
bridegroom
relief
of
mind
when
he
saw
the
bride
coming
was
so
great
as
to
do
away
with
all
the
usual
embarrassment
of
a
man
so
circumstanced
ha
now
we
are
all
right
he
said
to
harry
simpson
cousin
and
best
man
and
forthwith
acted
as
if
the
trouble
were
over
instead
of
just
beginning
there
was
nothing
shoppy
in
his
demeanour
now
even
to
prejudiced
eye
the
sisters
walked
up
the
nave
to
the
altar
hand
in
hand
deb
passed
the
bridesmaid
alice
urquhart
without
a
look
her
people
had
brought
the
young
pair
together
and
were
answerable
for
these
consequences
and
similarly
ignored
those
walking
mrs
and
miss
breen
she
landed
her
charge
at
the
appointed
hassock
and
quietly
facing
the
clergyman
stood
still
and
amid
the
usual
tearful
flutter
apparently
the
calmest
of
the
party
but
poor
deb
suffered
pangs
unspeakable
and
her
excessive
dignity
was
maintained
only
by
the
sternest
effort
in
the
vestry
after
the
ceremony
she
was
introduced
by
the
bride
to
her
new
relations
and
papa
breen
with
a
great
show
of
magnanimity
expressed
his
satisfaction
at
seeing
miss
pennycuick
on
this
suspicious
occasion
and
formally
invited
her
to
what
he
called
a
little
snack
at
menzies
where
a
gorgeous
wedding
breakfast
had
been
prepared
at
his
orders
thank
you
very
much
mr
breen
she
said
affably
it
would
have
given
me
great
pleasure
but
if
you
will
excuse
me
i
must
run
home
to
my
other
sisters
whom
i
left
in
ignorance
of
this
this
event
which
concerns
them
so
nearly
oh
deb
do
come
pleaded
the
bride
no
the
line
had
to
be
drawn
somewhere
deb
was
very
kind
very
polite
very
plausible
with
her
excuses
but
to
menzies
with
those
people
and
their
carriage
she
would
not
go
chapter
xviii
rose
had
never
been
reckoned
a
person
of
importance
by
her
family
but
now
that
she
was
gone
there
remained
a
terrible
emptiness
where
she
had
been
she
was
one
of
those
unselfish
members
of
households
to
whom
falls
the
the
the
fetching
and
carrying
the
filling
of
gaps
generally
and
at
every
turn
deb
and
frances
missed
her
unobtrusive
ministrations
which
they
had
accepted
as
as
much
matters
of
course
as
the
attentions
of
the
butcher
and
baker
it
was
presently
perceived
that
keziah
missed
her
too
that
keziah
who
had
loyally
opposed
the
plebeian
marriage
was
become
a
turncoat
and
renegade
blessing
where
she
should
have
cursed
blaming
where
she
should
have
praised
yes
blaming
even
queen
deborah
who
needless
to
say
took
her
head
off
for
it
it
had
been
keziah
own
choice
to
follow
the
sisters
into
exile
and
to
share
the
privations
involved
in
their
change
of
life
she
had
given
up
her
redford
luxuries
and
importance
to
become
a
general
servant
with
only
her
kitchen
to
sit
in
for
their
sakes
and
she
had
cheerfully
abided
by
her
choice
until
rose
went
rose
was
the
one
who
had
understood
the
cost
of
the
sacrifice
and
who
had
lightened
it
by
sympathetic
companionship
they
had
cleaned
rooms
and
made
cakes
and
puddings
and
set
hens
and
stirred
jam
and
ironed
frocks
and
laces
together
they
had
spent
hours
in
pleasant
gossip
over
the
many
homely
subjects
that
interested
both
their
relation
had
been
more
that
of
mother
and
daughter
than
of
servant
and
mistress
regarding
her
as
virtually
her
child
keziah
had
been
quick
to
spring
to
the
side
of
authority
in
the
matter
of
the
irregular
the
natural
parental
impulse
was
to
nip
it
in
the
bud
but
providence
had
decided
the
issue
in
this
case
and
a
flirtatious
girl
was
one
thing
and
a
respectable
married
woman
another
and
keziah
was
lonely
and
felt
neglected
and
put
upon
when
nobody
came
to
talk
to
her
in
her
kitchen
or
to
help
her
with
her
cooking
and
ironing
and
particularly
after
she
had
told
deb
that
it
was
a
shame
to
bear
malice
to
miss
rose
now
and
deb
had
commanded
her
to
mind
her
own
business
she
was
suspected
of
treacherous
visits
to
the
house
next
door
she
was
known
to
have
spent
sunday
afternoons
with
mrs
peter
herself
the
iniquity
of
these
proceedings
was
in
the
secrecy
she
observed
or
tried
to
observe
regarding
them
it
was
she
who
knew
before
anybody
else
when
a
baby
breen
was
coming
and
if
a
married
woman
was
a
personage
to
keziah
an
incipient
mother
was
a
being
of
the
highest
rank
she
had
forgiven
mary
everything
for
the
sake
of
her
boy
now
she
took
the
news
that
rose
was
what
she
called
interesting
to
deb
and
demanded
that
action
should
be
taken
upon
it
with
an
air
that
was
almost
truculent
deb
of
course
did
not
believe
in
being
spoken
to
even
by
keziah
in
that
way
has
the
muffin
boy
been
she
inquired
with
a
steady
look
it
too
soon
yet
and
i
can
tell
you
miss
deb
that
if
it
was
you
in
her
place
she
would
keep
it
up
like
this
and
at
such
a
time
too
when
the
muffin
boy
comes
keziah
please
pay
him
the
sixpence
we
owe
him
from
last
week
you
will
find
the
money
on
my
well
i
do
care
i
call
it
a
shame
not
to
go
to
her
perhaps
you
would
like
to
go
to
her
yourself
deb
swiftly
changed
her
tone
i
like
nothing
better
the
old
woman
retorted
with
spirit
if
you
are
agreeable
i
am
perfectly
agreeable
well
it
was
only
the
other
day
she
said
she
give
anything
to
have
me
if
it
was
for
taking
me
away
from
you
oh
pray
do
consider
that
i
can
easily
get
somebody
else
said
deb
affably
though
her
surprise
at
the
idea
of
keziah
wanting
to
leave
her
was
only
equalled
by
her
dismay
keziah
also
surprised
to
find
herself
of
so
much
less
consequence
than
she
had
supposed
said
that
if
that
was
the
case
she
go
and
see
miss
rose
about
it
you
can
go
now
said
deb
thank
you
miss
deb
i
will
said
keziah
as
soon
as
i
have
cleared
up
would
a
month
notice
suit
you
i
do
wish
to
put
you
about
at
all
a
month
will
be
ample
said
deb
a
week
if
you
like
i
see
what
miss
rose
says
said
keziah
rose
after
the
interview
wrote
affectionately
to
deb
to
say
she
would
not
dream
of
taking
keziah
if
deb
wanted
her
deb
wrote
affectionately
to
rose
to
say
that
she
would
be
rather
glad
than
otherwise
to
make
the
change
as
the
work
was
too
much
for
such
an
old
woman
so
keziah
went
over
to
the
breen
camp
where
she
had
comfort
and
companionship
and
her
own
way
in
everything
and
deb
began
to
experiment
with
the
common
or
garden
as
purveyed
by
melbourne
registry
offices
she
loathed
these
creatures
one
and
all
they
were
of
a
race
unknown
at
redford
and
she
was
singularly
unlucky
in
the
specimens
that
fell
to
her
although
some
of
them
could
have
been
made
something
of
by
a
mistress
who
knew
how
to
do
it
it
is
only
fair
to
state
that
they
loathed
her
for
a
finicking
unreasonable
poor
woman
who
gave
herself
the
airs
of
a
wealthy
lady
they
came
at
the
rate
of
two
a
month
and
each
one
as
she
passed
seemed
to
leave
the
little
house
meaner
dingier
more
damaged
than
before
it
was
not
living
it
was
pigging
frances
said
and
deb
agreed
with
her
although
when
keziah
ventured
to
call
one
day
to
inquire
into
the
state
of
things
deb
calmly
asserted
that
all
was
well
in
despair
she
tried
a
in
the
person
of
miss
keene
dying
to
return
to
her
dear
family
from
relations
who
did
not
want
her
on
any
terms
whatever
we
ask
her
to
do
we
must
do
ourselves
said
deb
to
grumbling
frances
who
seemed
never
willing
to
do
anything
and
of
course
we
shall
have
to
get
a
washwoman
and
a
charwoman
to
scrub
but
it
will
be
cheaper
in
the
end
and
oh
anything
rather
than
sticky
and
greasy
spoons
and
those
awful
voices
hailing
one
all
over
the
house
but
it
was
not
cheaper
nor
was
the
arrangement
satisfactory
in
any
way
after
the
first
fortnight
miss
keene
spoiled
at
redford
as
they
had
been
was
as
unfit
for
crude
housework
and
she
aggravated
her
incompetence
by
weeping
over
it
she
had
not
gathered
from
letters
that
the
change
in
the
family
fortunes
was
as
great
as
it
now
proved
to
be
and
deb
had
not
anticipated
the
effect
of
adversity
upon
one
so
easily
depressed
she
had
no
poor
thing
she
struggled
and
muddled
sighing
for
flowers
for
the
vases
while
the
beds
were
unmade
and
when
she
saw
a
certain
look
on
deb
face
wept
and
mourned
and
gave
up
hope
so
they
pigged
still
although
they
did
not
defile
the
furniture
with
unwashed
hands
and
the
plate
and
crockery
with
greasy
with
no
knowledge
of
cookery
they
lived
too
much
on
tinned
provisions
a
diet
as
wasteful
as
it
was
unwholesome
feeding
their
with
the
same
and
their
efforts
to
support
the
burden
of
their
domestic
responsibilities
deprived
them
of
outdoor
exercise
and
mental
rest
and
recreation
kept
them
at
too
close
quarters
with
one
another
each
rubbing
her
quivering
prickles
upon
the
irritable
skins
of
the
other
two
frances
bore
the
strain
with
least
and
and
since
she
had
to
vent
her
on
someone
naturally
made
miss
keene
her
victim
when
it
was
a
choice
between
her
and
deb
the
poor
lady
grew
more
and
more
disappointed
discouraged
and
tearful
she
became
subject
to
indigestion
headaches
disordered
nerves
finally
fell
ill
and
had
to
have
the
doctor
the
doctor
said
she
was
completely
run
down
and
that
rest
and
change
of
air
were
indispensable
she
went
away
to
her
relatives
weeping
still
wrapped
in
deb
cloak
and
with
all
deb
ready
money
in
her
pocket
and
she
did
not
come
back
then
deb
tried
to
carry
on
alone
any
sort
of
registry
office
drudge
would
have
been
welcome
now
but
had
become
an
expense
that
she
dared
not
continue
moreover
the
spectre
of
poverty
looming
so
distinct
and
unmistakable
in
the
house
was
a
thing
to
hide
if
possible
from
anybody
who
could
go
outside
and
talk
about
it
the
thing
had
become
a
living
terror
to
herself
its
claws
jew
so
velvety
and
innocent
when
her
wilful
ignorance
made
first
acquaintance
with
them
but
nobody
not
even
mr
thornycroft
not
even
jim
certainly
not
rose
could
be
allowed
to
play
perseus
to
this
proud
andromeda
until
she
could
free
herself
they
were
not
even
to
know
that
she
was
bound
of
course
she
need
not
have
been
bound
it
was
her
own
fault
she
should
have
managed
better
with
the
resources
at
her
disposal
than
to
bring
herself
to
such
a
pass
and
that
so
soon
either
mary
or
rose
would
certainly
have
done
so
in
her
place
but
nature
had
not
made
her
or
frances
whose
rapacities
had
been
one
cause
of
the
financial
breakdown
for
the
role
of
domestic
economists
they
had
been
dowered
with
their
lovely
faces
for
other
purposes
that
the
fine
plumage
is
for
the
sun
was
a
fact
well
understood
by
frances
at
any
rate
and
she
was
wild
at
the
wrongs
wrought
by
sordid
circumstances
her
father
and
sister
heedlessness
upon
herself
she
thought
only
of
herself
deb
was
getting
old
and
she
deserved
to
suffer
anyway
but
what
had
frances
done
to
be
deprived
of
her
of
all
her
chances
of
success
in
life
eighteen
and
no
coming
out
beautiful
and
nobody
to
see
it
marriageable
and
out
of
the
track
of
all
the
eligible
men
amongst
whom
she
might
have
had
her
pick
and
choice
she
had
reason
for
her
passionate
rebelliousness
against
this
state
of
things
for
while
a
pretty
face
is
theoretically
its
own
fortune
anywhere
we
all
see
for
ourselves
how
many
are
passed
over
simply
for
want
of
an
attractive
setting
it
was
quite
on
the
cards
that
she
might
share
the
fate
of
those
beauties
in
humble
life
to
whom
romantic
accidents
do
not
occur
for
all
her
golden
hair
and
aristocratic
profile
her
figure
of
a
sylph
and
complexion
of
a
wild
rose
the
fear
of
this
future
combined
with
the
acute
discomfort
of
the
present
to
make
her
desperate
she
cast
about
for
a
way
of
escape
a
pathway
to
the
sun
one
only
offered
the
landlord
he
was
an
elderly
landlord
who
had
lately
buried
a
frumpy
old
wife
and
he
was
as
deeply
tainted
with
trade
as
peter
breen
but
he
had
retired
long
since
from
personal
connection
with
breweries
and
and
a
brewer
in
the
social
scale
was
only
just
below
a
wholesale
importer
if
that
and
he
was
manifestly
rolling
in
money
after
the
manner
of
his
kind
half
the
streets
around
belonged
to
him
and
his
house
towered
up
in
the
midst
of
his
other
houses
a
great
white
block
with
a
pillared
portico
a
young
palace
by
comparison
above
all
he
had
no
known
children
from
the
first
he
had
taken
an
interest
in
his
pretty
he
had
liked
to
call
in
person
to
inquire
if
the
cellar
kept
dry
and
the
chimney
had
ceased
smoking
and
he
had
been
most
generous
in
offering
improvements
and
repairs
before
they
were
even
asked
for
deb
had
blighted
these
overtures
on
her
own
account
and
frances
herself
had
said
the
rudest
things
about
them
and
him
but
not
lately
in
the
utter
dullness
and
barrenness
of
her
life
she
had
been
glad
to
accept
the
civilities
of
anything
in
the
shape
of
a
man
to
try
her
hand
on
any
material
all
the
armoury
of
the
born
beauty
was
hers
and
she
knew
as
well
how
to
use
each
weapon
effectively
as
a
blind
kitten
knows
how
to
suck
milk
they
were
easily
successful
with
the
old
fool
who
is
ever
more
of
a
fool
than
the
young
fool
and
when
she
found
that
she
found
something
to
entertain
her
she
not
only
received
mr
ewing
when
he
called
but
talked
to
him
at
the
gate
when
he
went
past
and
he
went
past
several
times
a
day
now
when
the
situation
at
home
had
grown
desperate
and
she
was
looking
all
ways
for
means
to
save
herself
his
amusing
infatuation
became
a
matter
for
serious
thought
could
she
she
was
a
hard
case
but
even
she
wavered
he
was
probably
sixty
and
she
was
eighteen
oh
she
could
but
when
after
miss
keene
departure
deb
told
her
they
could
no
longer
afford
hired
help
and
that
she
frances
must
give
up
her
lazy
ways
and
take
her
share
of
that
intolerable
housework
then
frances
changed
her
mind
beggars
could
not
be
choosers
deb
felt
like
the
camel
under
the
last
straw
when
the
announcement
of
the
proposed
marriage
was
made
to
her
it
was
worse
than
mary
worse
than
rose
worse
than
any
other
misfortune
that
had
befallen
the
family
she
sat
down
and
wept
at
the
thought
of
what
the
pennycuicks
had
come
to
she
rated
frances
furiously
she
reasoned
with
her
she
pleaded
with
her
she
tried
to
bribe
her
but
frances
was
getting
boxes
of
diamonds
and
sets
of
furs
and
lace
and
what
not
and
it
was
useless
for
deb
to
attempt
to
outbid
the
giver
of
these
things
or
to
part
her
sister
from
them
she
loved
the
old
man
frances
said
he
certainly
was
a
rather
and
most
generous
old
man
and
he
was
going
to
take
her
everywhere
and
give
her
a
good
time
and
she
would
never
have
to
go
shabby
again
as
long
as
she
lived
and
if
deb
refused
her
a
proper
wedding
law
or
no
law
she
would
run
away
with
him
as
mary
had
run
away
with
bennet
goldsworthy
and
rose
with
peter
breen
whether
this
dire
threat
prevailed
or
the
temptation
of
the
money
or
whether
she
could
not
any
longer
fight
against
fate
deb
gave
in
after
all
frances
was
not
to
be
judged
as
an
ordinary
girl
she
was
a
prosaic
little
minx
for
which
reason
deb
pitied
the
prospective
husband
more
than
she
did
her
and
if
she
did
not
do
this
bad
thing
now
the
chances
were
that
she
would
do
a
worse
thing
later
on
she
was
made
to
disport
herself
in
the
sunshine
of
the
world
she
was
of
the
type
of
woman
that
must
have
men
about
her
she
would
get
her
rights
as
she
called
them
somehow
by
fair
means
or
foul
deb
was
sufficiently
a
woman
of
the
world
herself
to
recognise
this
and
the
uselessness
of
thinking
she
could
alter
it
well
money
is
a
consolatory
thing
she
knew
its
value
now
and
there
was
that
additional
comfort
which
of
course
she
did
not
own
to
the
thought
of
where
mr
ewing
would
be
when
mrs
ewing
was
in
her
prime
you
dear
old
thing
the
patronised
her
elder
sister
james
is
so
pleased
to
have
your
consent
and
he
says
he
wo
ask
you
to
give
me
my
share
of
what
father
left
us
it
would
be
but
a
drop
in
the
bucket
anyway
you
are
to
keep
it
all
yourself
deb
had
had
whole
control
of
the
fragments
of
his
once
large
fortune
left
by
mr
pennycuick
to
his
four
daughters
on
behalf
of
any
of
them
unmarried
or
under
age
but
mary
and
rose
although
peter
had
also
protested
against
it
had
been
paid
the
value
of
their
shares
whence
the
jew
element
in
the
present
difficulties
and
the
unforeseen
marriage
of
frances
at
eighteen
threatened
total
bankruptcy
to
the
remaining
sister
yet
deb
said
with
fierce
determination
of
course
you
will
have
what
is
your
due
like
the
others
i
sure
he
wo
take
it
deb
he
said
he
would
i
do
care
what
he
says
it
concerns
you
and
me
not
him
i
really
should
not
miss
it
dear
i
am
to
have
a
thousand
a
year
to
draw
against
for
just
nothing
but
my
clothes
and
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
said
deb
you
can
give
your
own
income
to
the
poor
you
really
wo
keep
it
is
it
likely
i
would
keep
what
does
belong
to
me
well
then
said
frances
her
easy
conscience
satisfied
we
can
put
it
into
my
trousseau
i
must
have
a
decent
trousseau
must
i
of
course
frances
saw
to
it
that
she
had
a
decent
one
now
was
the
time
the
only
time
that
she
should
want
her
money
and
she
did
not
spare
it
she
ordered
right
and
left
and
deb
seemed
equally
reckless
the
bills
were
left
for
her
to
settle
of
course
made
out
in
her
name
mr
ewing
pressed
for
permission
to
pay
them
and
the
cost
of
the
wedding
and
miss
pennycuick
could
hardly
forgive
him
the
deadly
insult
he
also
desired
that
she
should
occupy
her
villa
and
she
gave
him
notice
on
the
spot
i
shall
not
continue
to
keep
house
when
i
am
alone
said
she
grandly
i
intend
to
travel
for
a
time
the
wedding
was
quiet
but
as
decent
as
the
trousseau
the
other
sisters
were
invited
and
bennet
goldsworthy
who
delighted
in
the
connection
and
received
a
thumping
fee
performed
the
ceremony
deb
gave
the
bride
away
but
was
also
treated
as
the
bridesmaid
and
had
a
diamond
bracelet
forced
upon
her
she
sold
it
as
soon
as
the
back
was
turned
together
with
every
article
of
jewellery
in
her
possession
every
bit
of
silver
plate
and
all
her
furniture
the
breakfast
was
very
elegant
and
served
in
a
private
room
at
one
of
the
best
hotels
the
bride
handsome
luggage
had
also
been
brought
thither
and
it
was
the
of
the
family
which
so
seldom
met
there
also
when
she
had
parted
from
frances
deb
parted
from
mary
so
silent
and
constrained
and
from
rose
for
her
station
in
her
rich
gown
and
brussels
lace
but
nevertheless
sniffed
at
and
condescended
to
by
her
still
more
wealthy
sister
and
from
the
uncongenial
to
whom
she
was
so
discouragingly
polite
their
expressed
anxiety
to
befriend
and
to
see
more
of
her
was
gently
but
firmly
ignored
i
will
write
she
said
i
will
see
you
again
soon
i
will
let
you
know
my
plans
and
they
went
there
were
no
friends
to
go
for
she
had
insisted
on
inviting
none
for
fear
of
the
lynx
eyes
and
the
destructive
influence
upon
her
plans
of
mr
thornycroft
and
jim
she
gained
the
one
end
she
had
schemed
for
throughout
to
get
past
the
risks
of
the
public
marriage
and
back
to
her
struggle
in
obscurity
unmolested
unpitied
unshamed
the
urquharts
wrote
and
mr
thornycroft
when
he
sent
his
present
but
she
had
bluffed
them
with
her
implied
misrepresentations
and
hurt
their
feelings
by
not
wanting
them
at
the
wedding
jim
was
easily
snubbed
mr
thornycroft
though
he
did
not
mention
it
was
ill
at
the
time
so
she
got
rid
of
all
possible
hindrances
and
then
professing
to
go
travelling
went
nobody
knew
where
and
was
virtually
lost
for
years
frances
drove
away
from
the
hotel
in
her
smart
carriage
with
her
smart
luggage
and
smart
maid
and
her
amorous
old
husband
and
never
thought
or
cared
what
was
to
become
of
her
abandoned
sister
she
could
only
think
of
her
own
exciting
affairs
partly
they
were
unsatisfactory
no
doubt
all
her
rights
were
not
hers
even
now
no
not
by
a
long
way
but
oh
how
much
better
was
this
than
the
drab
and
shabby
and
barren
existence
for
ever
left
behind
she
was
bound
indeed
yet
she
was
free
freer
than
another
might
have
been
in
her
place
and
far
far
less
bound
one
must
expect
to
pay
some
tax
to
fortune
for
such
extraordinary
gifts
and
frances
was
not
the
one
to
pay
it
in
heart
blood
she
was
philosophically
prepared
to
pay
it
in
her
own
coin
and
be
done
with
it
and
then
give
herself
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
pleasures
of
her
lot
her
first
enjoyment
was
in
her
beautiful
dress
grey
cloth
and
chinchilla
fur
with
flushes
of
pink
as
delicate
as
the
rose
of
her
cheeks
and
in
her
knowledge
of
the
effect
she
made
in
that
dream
of
a
costume
there
was
no
hiding
her
light
under
a
bushel
any
more
the
highway
and
the
middle
of
it
for
her
now
her
proud
husband
strutting
there
beside
her
and
every
turning
to
look
at
and
to
admire
her
there
was
joy
in
the
occupancy
of
the
best
suite
of
rooms
in
the
best
hotel
at
every
place
she
stopped
at
during
her
gay
and
bridal
holiday
joy
in
the
dainty
meals
so
long
unknown
in
the
obsequious
servants
in
the
plentiful
theatres
in
the
carriage
that
took
her
to
them
in
the
having
one
hair
done
to
perfection
by
an
expert
maid
in
sweeping
forth
with
one
silks
and
laces
trailing
and
one
diamonds
on
these
were
the
delights
for
which
her
little
soul
had
so
long
yearned
she
now
pursued
them
greedily
she
could
not
rest
if
she
were
not
doing
something
to
display
herself
and
feed
her
craving
for
what
is
known
as
seeing
the
world
her
husband
was
almost
as
obsequious
as
the
servants
doubtless
because
from
the
first
she
took
the
beauty
high
hand
with
him
as
well
as
the
attitude
of
the
superior
naturally
assumed
by
youth
towards
age
and
he
enjoyed
the
sensation
she
made
almost
as
much
as
she
did
visibly
he
swelled
and
preened
himself
when
his
venerable
contemporaries
cast
the
eye
of
surprise
not
to
say
of
envy
upon
the
conjunction
of
his
complacent
figure
and
that
of
the
bride
who
might
have
been
his
he
toiled
for
that
pleasure
and
to
make
pleasure
for
her
as
no
old
gentleman
should
toil
he
gave
her
everything
she
asked
for
including
his
own
ease
and
consequence
his
own
vital
health
and
strength
but
the
honeymoon
waned
and
the
novelty
wore
off
and
prudence
and
old
habits
resumed
their
sway
he
grew
tired
of
incessant
gadding
about
alarmed
at
his
symptoms
of
physical
overstrain
weary
for
his
and
his
club
and
his
men
friends
and
his
masculine
occupations
she
on
the
other
hand
insatiable
for
admiration
and
excitement
still
was
weary
of
his
constant
company
it
became
the
of
her
festive
days
growing
from
a
necessary
bore
to
an
intolerable
irritation
as
the
dimensions
of
her
little
court
of
younger
gallants
enlarged
about
her
therefore
she
had
no
objection
to
his
halting
on
the
toilsome
path
so
long
as
he
allowed
her
to
go
on
alone
it
was
not
a
case
of
allowing
however
he
might
object
and
did
but
he
was
no
match
for
her
either
in
diplomacy
or
in
fight
and
her
cajoleries
were
usually
sufficient
for
her
ends
without
calling
out
the
reserves
behind
them
in
any
contest
between
selfishness
and
unselfishness
the
result
is
a
foregone
conclusion
so
she
began
to
go
about
with
miscellaneous
escorts
to
play
the
combined
parts
of
frisky
matron
and
society
beauty
an
intoxicating
experience
while
the
supporter
of
that
proud
position
played
the
humble
role
of
chief
unseen
and
unconsidered
in
the
basement
of
the
fabric
he
attended
to
his
investments
and
increasing
infirmities
and
made
secret
visits
to
a
married
daughter
wife
of
a
big
who
hated
her
young
and
whose
existence
frances
ignored
one
day
guthrie
carey
after
several
voyages
to
other
ports
appeared
again
in
melbourne
he
had
just
landed
and
was
strolling
along
collins
street
when
he
encountered
a
vision
of
loveliness
that
almost
took
away
his
breath
what
it
is
not
miss
frances
surely
it
is
not
smiled
she
all
her
beauty
at
its
conscious
best
as
she
recognised
his
which
was
that
of
a
man
of
men
splendid
in
his
strong
prime
and
she
told
him
who
she
was
and
a
few
other
things
as
they
stood
on
the
pavement
she
so
graceful
in
her
mature
he
staring
at
her
stupidly
distraught
like
a
bewildered
i
had
no
idea
he
mumbled
that
i
was
married
alas
yes
with
a
sad
shake
of
the
head
we
girls
are
fated
i
think
miss
deb
oh
not
deb
she
has
escaped
so
far
is
she
well
i
have
not
seen
her
lately
but
i
am
sure
she
is
she
always
is
she
is
not
in
melbourne
no
i
do
quite
know
where
she
is
she
has
got
a
wandering
fit
on
come
and
have
some
lunch
with
me
and
i
tell
you
all
the
news
they
turned
into
a
restaurant
and
had
a
meal
which
took
a
long
time
to
get
through
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
they
parted
on
the
understanding
that
he
would
dine
with
her
later
in
her
own
house
at
the
end
of
the
few
days
that
were
virtually
filled
with
him
mrs
ewing
sat
down
in
her
fine
boudoir
to
weep
over
her
hard
fate
oh
why
was
he
the
one
to
have
the
money
oh
why
do
we
meet
again
now
that
it
is
too
late
at
the
end
of
a
few
more
days
she
went
to
her
old
husband
to
ask
him
how
he
was
he
said
he
was
a
bit
troubled
with
his
lumbago
but
otherwise
fairly
well
what
you
want
said
she
is
a
he
thought
not
he
had
never
found
the
sea
suit
him
and
travelling
was
a
great
fatigue
and
it
was
the
wrong
time
of
year
for
it
anyhow
they
had
a
good
home
and
it
was
the
best
place
but
she
knew
better
she
had
made
up
her
mind
and
it
was
useless
for
him
to
rebel
the
was
decided
on
not
so
much
because
it
would
benefit
his
health
as
because
his
young
wife
had
not
seen
england
and
europe
and
was
dying
to
do
so
then
they
discussed
routes
the
thing
to
do
said
mrs
ewing
is
not
to
crowd
up
with
that
lot
in
the
mail
steamers
where
you
ca
do
as
you
like
or
have
any
special
attentions
but
to
go
in
a
smaller
vessel
where
you
would
be
of
some
importance
and
have
your
liberty
and
plenty
of
space
and
no
tiresome
rules
and
restrictions
my
dear
child
you
do
know
those
lines
i
do
i
assure
you
you
be
very
sorry
for
yourself
if
i
let
you
travel
by
them
they
are
not
your
style
at
all
yes
i
was
talking
to
captain
carey
about
it
and
that
was
his
advice
and
he
knows
on
his
ship
they
have
accommodation
for
about
six
passengers
and
he
suggested
that
if
we
were
quick
about
it
we
might
be
able
to
secure
the
whole
so
as
to
be
exactly
as
if
we
were
on
a
yacht
of
our
own
they
have
a
fair
cook
but
we
could
take
any
servants
we
liked
and
make
ourselves
comfortable
in
our
own
way
nobody
to
interfere
with
us
he
does
go
through
the
hot
canal
he
will
be
back
from
sydney
in
three
weeks
just
nice
time
to
get
ready
in
of
course
they
went
that
way
and
perhaps
it
is
better
to
leave
the
rest
of
the
story
to
the
imagination
of
the
reader
who
one
hopes
for
guthrie
carey
sake
is
a
person
as
well
as
a
dispassionate
student
of
human
nature
chapter
xix
deb
was
at
redford
once
more
in
her
own
room
too
surrounded
by
familiar
objects
the
and
the
wardrobe
and
the
aspinalled
that
was
a
fixture
amongst
other
things
she
had
not
taken
them
to
her
suburban
villa
nor
sent
for
them
afterwards
meanwhile
mr
thornycroft
had
bought
them
with
the
place
and
taken
care
of
them
as
of
everything
that
she
had
left
behind
they
had
been
in
his
possession
now
for
several
years
the
strange
thing
in
the
room
was
mr
thornycroft
himself
mr
thornycroft
on
the
little
white
bed
that
deb
used
to
sleep
on
his
hair
white
his
once
stalwart
frame
reduced
to
a
pale
wreck
of
skin
and
bone
you
will
forgive
me
for
coming
here
he
apologised
i
have
not
been
using
the
things
but
they
had
me
moved
for
coolness
the
aspect
and
being
able
to
get
a
current
through
i
am
thankful
they
did
it
is
the
best
place
for
you
this
weather
but
there
one
thing
i
shall
never
forgive
you
that
you
did
let
me
know
before
she
was
sitting
at
his
bedside
holding
his
hand
she
too
much
changed
thinner
sadder
shabbier
or
rather
less
splendidly
turned
out
than
had
been
her
wont
in
earlier
days
beautiful
as
ever
notwithstanding
infinitely
more
so
in
the
sick
man
eyes
why
should
i
bother
you
i
have
been
very
bad
just
the
old
asthma
off
and
on
it
is
only
lately
that
i
have
felt
it
upsetting
my
heart
and
you
know
i
am
used
to
being
alone
he
spoke
with
the
asthma
pant
and
a
throb
of
the
lean
throat
that
she
could
not
bear
to
see
his
head
was
propped
high
so
that
they
squarely
faced
each
other
his
eyes
were
full
of
tenderness
and
content
hers
of
tears
you
have
been
pretty
lonely
yourself
by
all
accounts
said
he
stroking
her
hand
it
odd
to
think
of
you
in
that
case
debbie
i
felt
it
odd
myself
she
smiled
with
a
whisk
of
her
handkerchief
but
like
you
i
am
getting
used
to
it
where
dalzell
all
this
time
do
know
do
care
please
talk
of
him
nobody
else
oh
dear
no
never
will
be
i
am
going
to
take
up
nursing
or
something
you
he
mocked
do
you
suppose
i
ca
wait
till
i
have
got
you
over
this
attack
and
then
tell
me
if
i
ca
i
am
going
to
stay
with
you
godpapa
until
you
are
better
i
have
spoken
to
your
housekeeper
and
she
is
quite
agreeable
if
you
are
he
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
reply
to
that
hint
but
just
smiled
and
closed
his
eyes
she
took
up
a
fan
and
fanned
him
watching
him
anxiously
it
was
a
roasting
february
day
and
he
was
breathing
very
badly
have
you
given
up
your
house
he
asked
when
he
could
speak
long
ago
no
use
my
staying
there
alone
besides
i
could
not
afford
it
francie
not
much
good
to
you
i
suppose
oh
i
do
want
her
to
be
good
to
me
keziah
moon
has
deserted
you
of
course
oh
keziah
she
was
moped
to
death
poor
old
woman
i
found
her
a
nuisance
and
then
those
babies
of
rose
were
so
irresistible
i
thought
she
better
go
as
rose
i
believe
she
is
in
her
element
is
rose
happy
with
her
draper
i
do
know
i
suppose
so
you
do
see
much
of
her
not
much
and
mary
i
have
seen
her
for
months
her
husband
and
i
do
hit
it
off
somehow
deb
how
much
have
you
to
live
on
that
my
business
sir
not
the
business
of
a
doting
godfather
in
the
absence
of
nearer
male
relatives
no
his
business
is
only
to
see
that
i
learn
the
catechism
and
present
myself
to
be
confirmed
and
i
done
both
that
all
except
to
let
his
doting
godchild
take
care
of
him
when
he
is
now
do
talk
any
more
he
was
too
exhausted
to
do
so
and
while
he
lay
feebly
fighting
for
breath
the
trained
nurse
came
in
and
took
command
in
the
evening
that
functionary
gave
a
professional
opinion
he
is
worried
about
something
she
said
to
deb
and
it
is
very
bad
for
him
do
you
know
what
it
is
not
in
the
least
said
deb
promptly
i
have
not
been
seeing
him
for
years
i
am
sorry
to
say
and
have
not
the
slightest
knowledge
of
his
affairs
but
next
day
she
seemed
to
get
an
inkling
of
what
the
worry
was
mr
thornycroft
when
they
were
alone
together
begged
her
to
tell
him
if
she
had
any
money
difficulties
debts
she
supposed
and
to
be
frank
with
him
for
old
times
and
her
father
sake
what
are
you
bothering
your
mind
about
that
she
gently
scolded
him
i
assure
you
i
am
all
right
i
have
any
difficulties
or
hardly
any
not
now
i
have
no
rent
you
see
they
do
charge
you
anything
where
you
board
no
redford
never
has
charged
folks
for
board
seriously
she
hastened
to
add
in
earnest
tones
i
have
all
i
want
and
if
i
try
presently
to
earn
more
it
will
be
because
i
think
everybody
ought
to
earn
his
living
or
hers
you
earned
yours
i
despise
people
who
just
batten
on
the
earnings
of
others
and
never
do
a
hand
turn
for
themselves
batten
he
murmured
ironically
with
a
troubled
smile
you
look
as
if
you
had
been
battening
do
you
debbie
i
a
business
man
and
i
know
you
ca
get
behindhand
in
money
matters
and
pull
up
again
just
when
you
want
to
you
ca
get
straight
merely
by
anticipating
income
when
there
nothing
extra
coming
in
tell
me
if
you
do
mind
how
you
managed
she
flushed
and
her
eyes
dropped
then
she
faced
him
honestly
i
will
tell
you
she
declared
i
wanted
to
confess
it
though
horribly
ashamed
to
and
i
afraid
you
think
i
did
not
value
it
i
did
indeed
i
hated
to
part
with
it
but
i
was
so
hard
up
and
i
know
which
way
to
turn
or
what
else
to
do
and
never
came
to
me
well
i
did
in
a
way
i
i
sold
your
pearls
that
right
debbie
that
a
load
off
my
mind
it
is
the
best
thing
you
could
have
done
with
them
no
indeed
i
have
regretted
it
ever
since
how
much
did
they
give
you
a
tremendous
lot
three
hundred
and
fifty
guineas
the
swindlers
they
were
worth
two
thousand
what
she
was
thunderstruck
you
gave
me
a
necklace
worth
two
thousand
guineas
i
only
wish
you
let
me
give
you
a
score
or
two
at
the
same
price
on
condition
that
you
sold
them
for
whenever
you
needed
a
little
cash
she
was
quite
upset
by
this
remark
and
what
had
given
rise
to
it
impulsively
too
impulsively
considering
how
weak
he
was
she
kissed
his
damp
forehead
and
rushed
weeping
from
his
sight
in
the
hot
evening
while
the
trained
nurse
had
her
tea
at
grateful
leisure
in
the
housekeeper
room
deb
again
took
that
nurse
place
she
sat
by
the
pillow
of
the
patient
leaning
against
it
holding
his
hand
in
hers
only
the
sound
of
the
cruel
north
wind
and
his
more
cruel
breathing
disturbed
the
stillness
that
enveloped
them
she
hoped
he
was
sleeping
until
he
spoke
suddenly
in
a
way
that
showed
him
only
too
wide
awake
debbie
he
said
if
i
was
quite
sure
i
would
not
get
well
this
time
i
should
put
that
question
to
you
again
what
question
dear
she
queried
softly
the
question
i
asked
you
just
before
you
left
redford
i
do
remember
oh
yes
that
one
but
if
you
consented
i
might
recover
it
would
be
enough
to
make
me
then
you
would
repent
she
was
silent
agitated
in
every
fibre
of
her
but
thinking
hard
what
put
that
idea
into
your
head
she
whispered
still
holding
his
hand
it
was
never
put
in
it
was
there
always
since
you
were
a
kiddie
it
seems
so
strange
i
thought
i
was
always
a
kiddie
to
you
that
does
seem
the
natural
relationship
does
it
there
fell
another
long
silence
and
listening
to
his
dragging
breath
her
heart
smote
her
she
squeezed
his
bony
hand
i
will
stay
with
you
anyway
she
comforted
him
he
turned
his
head
on
the
pillow
kiss
me
he
sighed
with
eyes
closed
she
did
again
and
again
the
night
was
suffocating
she
could
not
sleep
for
the
heat
and
her
thoughts
and
when
towards
morning
she
heard
the
nurse
stirring
she
got
up
to
inquire
how
he
was
pretty
bad
the
nurse
said
it
this
awful
weather
i
ca
cool
the
room
though
i
got
all
the
doors
and
windows
open
and
the
wet
sheets
hanging
up
it
air
he
wants
and
there
is
any
if
it
change
soon
i
afraid
his
strength
wo
hold
out
it
did
not
change
and
consequently
grew
worse
to
bear
the
parching
and
scorching
of
each
day
being
carried
over
into
the
next
what
the
newspapers
call
a
was
drawing
to
its
culmination
which
generally
reaches
the
verge
of
the
unbearable
even
to
the
well
and
strong
just
before
the
change
that
lightning
change
to
coolness
and
even
coldness
which
comes
while
one
draws
a
breath
how
many
a
life
has
hung
upon
the
chance
of
the
blessed
moment
coming
in
time
the
nurse
looked
at
the
thermometer
in
despair
darkness
had
not
taken
degrees
from
yesterday
temperature
of
degrees
when
another
blazing
sun
arose
the
fierce
wind
had
raved
and
calmed
and
raved
and
calmed
but
it
had
not
shifted
she
wetted
and
she
fanned
turn
and
turn
about
with
deb
the
livelong
day
without
freshening
the
dead
air
that
soaked
the
house
and
seemed
to
soak
the
world
the
fagged
and
perspiring
doctor
a
great
friend
of
the
patient
who
came
twice
daily
came
again
too
tired
to
care
very
much
even
for
this
special
case
he
looked
at
it
and
shook
his
head
and
begged
for
a
cool
drink
for
the
lord
sake
and
then
having
muddled
the
wits
he
had
tried
to
stimulate
with
quarts
of
went
away
saying
i
can
do
nothing
send
for
me
at
once
if
you
see
a
change
at
sunset
the
sick
man
was
very
low
his
weak
heart
and
his
distressed
lungs
labouring
heavily
while
the
sweat
of
agony
glistened
on
his
forehead
and
plastered
his
white
hair
to
his
head
deb
was
frantic
with
fear
and
grief
she
summoned
the
doctor
again
sending
commands
to
him
to
summon
more
doctors
the
best
in
melbourne
and
any
number
of
them
in
defiance
of
mr
thornycroft
known
wishes
to
the
contrary
at
the
same
time
she
sent
for
the
clergyman
dear
she
crooned
in
the
patient
ear
when
he
seemed
a
little
easier
mr
bentley
will
be
here
presently
mr
thornycroft
brows
seemed
to
gather
a
momentary
frown
over
his
closed
eyes
i
rather
not
deb
oh
not
for
that
but
the
wind
will
change
soon
and
then
you
will
feel
better
and
then
you
said
it
would
help
you
to
get
well
i
will
if
you
like
he
opened
his
eyes
and
gazed
at
her
it
took
him
a
few
seconds
to
understand
ah
darling
he
breathed
between
his
pants
and
with
an
effort
drew
her
hand
to
his
lips
then
they
were
his
last
words
whispered
very
low
never
mind
now
debbie
so
long
as
you
are
here
he
seemed
to
drowse
into
a
kind
of
in
spite
of
his
too
obvious
and
audible
suffering
she
sat
beside
him
sponging
and
fanning
him
listening
to
his
shallow
jerky
wheezy
respiration
watching
for
the
subtle
something
in
the
stifling
room
that
should
announce
a
change
of
wind
thinking
of
mr
bentley
coming
and
many
other
things
the
weary
nurse
came
back
from
her
brief
rest
and
cup
of
tea
and
sat
down
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
she
studied
the
patient
face
intently
for
some
time
and
felt
his
feet
then
she
took
the
fan
from
deborah
hand
you
go
and
lie
down
miss
pennycuick
mrs
dobson
will
come
and
sit
with
me
for
a
while
no

said
deb
he
wants
me
to
be
here
i
can
not
leave
him
after
a
few
more
minutes
of
silence
the
nurse
said
again
you
had
better
go
miss
pennycuick
when
deb
repeated
her
refusal
the
nurse
went
out
to
fetch
the
housekeeper
to
persuade
her
a
minute
afterwards
deb
lifted
her
head
with
a
jerk
and
sniffed
eagerly
at
the
same
instant
she
heard
a
distant
door
bang
thank
god
she
ejaculated
and
flew
to
the
windows
that
all
day
had
had
to
be
shut
tight
against
the
furnace
blast
outside
and
flung
them
wide
one
after
the
other
the
trees
in
the
old
garden
were
bending
and
rustling
the
sweet
cool
air
came
pouring
in
the
wind

she
whispered
almost
hysterically
to
the
nurse
and
the
housekeeper
as
they
stealthily
crept
in
and
as
they
all
gathered
round
the
bed
he
is
better
already
his
breathing
is
easier
the
nurse
bent
over
the
long
figure
on
the
bed
he
is
not
breathing

all

chapter
xx
jim
urquhart
had
been
fighting
bush
fires
for
several
days
when
the
wind
changed
and
carried
them
back
over
the
burnt
ground
that
extinguished
them
when
he
rode
home
dead
beat
from
helping
a
neighbour
who
had
helped
him
it
was
to
meet
the
news
that
mr
thornycroft
was
dead
and
mrs
urquhart
gone
to
redford
to
support
deborah
pennycuick
mr
thornycroft
had
been
ailing
with
his
asthma
so
long
and
making
so
little
fuss
about
it
that
his
friends
had
come
to
regard
him
as
practically
ailing
nothing
the
death
that
had
slowly
stalked
him
for
years
came
upon
them
with
the
shock
of
the
unexpected
so
the
newspapers
said
jim
heart
smote
him
for
that
he
had
been
so
taken
up
with
the
fire
epidemic
as
to
have
neglected
for
over
a
week
to
inquire
after
the
old
man
it
smote
him
more
when
he
heard
that
deb
had
been
at
redford
through
the
ordeal
without
anyone
near
her
he
had
known
too
well
had
made
it
his
business
to
know
that
she
had
had
a
struggling
life
to
think
of
for
a
long
time
but
under
various
pretexts
she
had
kept
everybody
at
and
further
refusing
aid
or
pity
now
there
had
come
a
chance
to
do
something
for
her
and
he
had
been
out
of
the
way
and
duty
still
detained
him
to
arrange
about
destroyed
fences
and
foodless
stock
duty
that
had
to
be
considered
first
even
before
her
when
at
last
he
was
free
to
put
himself
at
her
disposal
a
dozen
men
had
jumped
his
claim
the
manager
of
redford
met
him
when
a
few
miles
from
the
place
you
are
behind
the
fair
mr
urquhart
cried
he
as
they
drew
rein
alongside
and
his
tone
and
his
face
were
strangely
cheerful
considering
that
his
good
employer
of
twenty
years
had
been
buried
only
yesterday
as
usual
within
a
few
hours
of
his
death
but
i
suppose
you
have
heard
the
news
what
you
have
then
i
am
the
first
to
congratulate
you
extending
a
cordial
hand
the
will
was
read
this
morning
and
you
got
the
biggest
legacy
a
cool
five
thousand
sir
five
thousand
jim
never
on
particularly
intimate
terms
with
the
testator
had
not
thought
of
the
will
and
the
idea
that
he
might
have
an
interest
in
it
never
crossed
his
mind
five
thousand
it
is
said
of
drowning
people
that
they
see
the
whole
panorama
of
their
lives
in
the
last
seconds
of
consciousness
in
the
instant
pause
that
followed
the
manager
announcement
jim
saw
five
creeks
renovated
and
prosperous
and
deb
children
running
about
the
old
rooms
and
paddocks
and
calling
him
father
a
home
not
quite
unworthy
of
his
goddess
now
and
one
that
loneliness
and
poverty
would
have
taught
her
to
appreciate
he
stared
at
the
burly
manager
like
a
man
in
a
dream
i
get
a
nice
little
windfall
myself
which
i
never
expected
the
latter
continued
his
tale
the
servants
are
well
provided
for
and
there
are
odd
sums
for
a
lot
of
english
relatives
i
suppose
they
are
and
a
good
bit
for
charities
but
yours
is
the
biggest
individual
legacy
and
i
glad
of
it
and
i
not
surprised
because
i
heard
him
many
a
time
speak
well
of
you
for
the
way
you
worked
to
keep
up
your
place
and
look
after
the
family
but
said
jim
coming
down
from
his
clouds
of
glory
i
thought
i
thought
there
be
more
than
that
than
what
you
surely
expect
oh
i
see
the
manager
threw
up
his
head
and
roared
my
good
fellow
the
estate
altogether
is
worth
a
quarter
of
a
million
then
who
gets
it
miss
pennycuick
she
here
now
and
could
believe
it
when
they
told
her
though
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
it
was
a
natural
thing
for
him
to
do
having
been
such
friends
with
the
old
man
and
she
his
a
lucky
young
woman
my
word
jim
swelled
heart
collapsed
and
sank
like
a
burst
balloon
his
vanished
in
thin
air
to
be
built
no
more
that
settles
it
he
said
to
himself
according
to
his
code
of
manly
honour
and
a
man
could
not
possibly
even
with
five
thousand
pounds
in
hand
ask
a
girl
with
a
quarter
of
a
million
to
marry
him
a
little
more
conversation
if
it
can
be
called
such
when
one
talked
and
the
other
did
not
even
listen
and
he
parted
with
the
garrulous
manager
and
rode
on
to
the
house
deb
met
him
with
a
welcome
that
severely
tried
his
spartan
fortitude
without
in
the
least
weakening
his
resolve
although
she
did
not
know
it
being
still
filled
with
grief
for
her
lifelong
friend
it
was
the
power
and
command
that
he
had
endowed
her
with
which
gave
that
charming
air
of
fearless
and
open
affection
to
her
manner
oh
my
dear
dear
boy
she
addressed
him
and
all
but
kissed
him
before
his
mother
eyes
i
am
so
glad
to
have
you
here
jim
dear
mrs
urquhart
thinks
you
can
be
spared
will
you
stay
here
for
a
bit
and
help
me
to
settle
things
there
is
so
much
to
do
and
it
is
my
duty
to
attend
to
everything
myself
there
are
the
lawyers
and
people
of
course
everybody
is
so
kind
but
i
want
a
man
of
my
own
beside
me
certainly
deb
he
replied
without
wincing
for
as
long
as
you
want
me
if
i
can
run
home
every
other
day
or
so
for
a
look
round
he
stayed
in
company
with
his
mother
for
a
month
then
when
he
went
to
live
at
home
again
he
spent
at
least
half
his
days
at
redford
acting
as
deb
man
indoors
and
out
her
real
legal
adviser
her
real
station
manager
her
confidential
the
doer
of
all
the
work
connected
with
the
administration
of
her
estate
and
never
although
she
exposed
him
to
almost
every
sort
of
temptation
never
once
stepped
off
the
line
that
he
had
marked
for
himself
another
person
was
not
so
scrupulous
though
to
be
sure
he
was
not
so
poor
claud
dalzell
drifting
from
one
resort
of
the
wealthy
to
another
in
scotland
in
norway
shooting
in
the
rockies
hunting
in
the
shires
yachting
everywhere
and
everywhere
adored
of
a
crowd
of
women
as
idle
as
himself
was
loafing
at
monte
carlo
when
he
heard
of
mr
thornycroft
death
and
accession
to
his
throne
ennui
and
satiety
possessed
the
popular
young
man
at
the
moment
for
he
was
made
for
better
things
and
his
dissatisfied
soul
tormented
him
and
a
vision
of
redford
and
the
beautiful
girl
who
was
like
wine
and
fire
a
blend
of
passion
and
purity
that
now
impressed
him
as
unique
rose
before
his
mental
eyes
with
the
effect
of
in
a
dry
land
his
thoughts
went
back
to
the
days
when
they
rode
and
made
love
together
the
sunny
days
before
the
clouds
gathered
it
was
that
past
which
glorified
her
all
at
once
not
the
present
not
mr
thornycroft
money
not
the
halo
of
elegance
and
consequence
that
again
adorned
her
he
never
suspected
otherwise
for
a
moment
and
that
was
why
he
did
not
hesitate
to
book
a
passage
to
australia
that
very
day
deb
was
at
redford
when
he
arrived
that
she
would
never
part
with
the
place
again
she
had
declared
on
the
day
that
it
came
into
her
possession
and
she
was
now
establishing
herself
there
she
said
for
life
she
had
gone
through
the
whole
great
rambling
house
sorting
and
rearranging
the
furniture
that
was
in
it
adding
the
cream
of
the
contents
of
the
best
shops
in
town
she
made
a
clean
sweep
of
the
now
fittings
of
the
big
replacing
them
with
parquet
rugs
and
divans
and
things
of
the
softest
finest
and
most
costly
kind
she
arranged
the
for
herself
afresh
also
the
glazed
corridor
which
became
a
beautiful
art
gallery
and
also
the
remainder
of
the
long
unused
rooms
she
called
to
her
all
the
favourite
old
servants
except
keziah
moon
who
was
happy
where
she
was
and
old
miss
keene
to
play
chaperon
once
more
with
nothing
to
do
but
arrange
flowers
and
doze
at
peace
in
the
lap
of
luxury
deb
wanted
jim
for
her
manager
at
a
ridiculous
salary
but
he
would
not
take
the
post
he
did
however
procure
her
an
excellent
substitute
she
commissioned
him
to
buy
her
he
knew
what
she
liked
regardless
of
expense
an
english
groom
was
given
charge
of
them
when
they
arrived
so
easily
did
the
magnificent
woman
slide
back
into
her
magnificent
ways
for
all
her
good
taste
and
unpretentiousness
when
claud
dalzell
was
driven
in
his
hired
buggy
from
the
township
to
her
door
his
critical
eye
took
in
the
many
changes
that
the
old
homestead
had
undergone
with
high
approval
used
as
he
was
to
far
finer
houses
and
the
best
of
everything
he
felt
that
here
was
as
fair
a
as
even
he
could
desire
redford
with
a
quarter
of
a
million
behind
it
with
this
setting
of
sunshine
and
spaciousness
missed
so
much
more
than
he
had
known
till
now
inclined
what
a
haven
of
rest
and
pleasure
after
the
crowded
and
fatiguing
experiences
of
his
later
years
he
was
shown
upstairs
to
the
big
he
hardly
knew
where
he
was
with
the
carpet
and
festooned
and
gilding
and
vanished
and
these
stuffs
and
subtle
harmonies
around
him
he
could
recognise
nothing
but
a
few
pictures
and
the
old
piano
the
latter
spread
with
a
gem
of
chinese
embroidery
on
which
stood
a
gem
of
a
satsuma
bowl
filled
with
fine
chrysanthemums
it
was
late
in
autumn
now
and
while
he
wandered
about
examining
this
and
that
with
the
pleasure
of
a
satisfied
connoisseur
deb
stood
in
the
downstairs
with
clenched
hands
and
teeth
staring
at
his
card
on
a
table
before
her
he
has
the
cheek
she
thought
afire
with
indignation
never
so
hot
and
bitter
as
when
directed
against
one
we
love
who
has
offended
us
he
has
the
unspeakable
effrontery
to
come
and
see
me
now
when
he
never
came
near
me
all
those
hard
years
never
cared
how
i
muddled
and
struggled
nor
whether
i
was
alive
or
dead
but
she
must
see
him
of
course
and
she
must
maintain
her
proper
dignity
no
descending
to
vulgar
reproaches
still
less
to
weak
condonation
she
took
a
moment
to
calm
herself
and
walked
forth
to
the
interview
many
things
upheld
her
but
the
dead
hand
of
mr
thornycroft
was
her
stoutest
support
she
needed
it
when
she
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
facing
the
door
awaiting
her
stood
the
figure
that
really
seemed
the
one
thing
wanting
to
complete
the
beauty
of
the
beautiful
house
he
had
never
in
his
younger
days
been
so
as
he
was
now
in
any
company
in
any
part
of
the
world
he
must
have
attracted
notice
as
a
gentleman
in
person
and
manners
of
the
very
finest
type
and
how
she
did
love
that
sort
how
her
lonely
and
hungry
heart
longed
for
him
when
she
saw
him
the
only
man
she
had
ever
deemed
her
natural
mate
and
at
the
same
time
how
she
hated
him
for
the
disappointment
and
the
humiliation
that
he
had
brought
her
outraged
her
robust
and
her
quarter
of
a
million
sufficed
to
save
her
from
a
temptation
she
would
not
have
fallen
into
for
the
world
she
swept
forward
to
shake
hands
with
him
with
the
grave
affability
of
a
great
lady
to
a
guest
any
guest
and
it
was
plain
from
the
expression
of
his
sensitive
face
that
he
was
as
keenly
appreciative
of
her
enhanced
beauty
and
as
she
of
his
black
was
not
her
colour
she
was
too
dark
and
she
had
discarded
it
for
pale
greys
and
whites
with
touches
of
black
about
them
today
a
creamy
woollen
thick
and
soft
and
hanging
about
her
like
the
drapery
of
a
greek
statue
was
an
inspiration
in
becoming
gowns
the
maid
who
had
dressed
her
hair
was
a
mistress
of
the
art
and
miss
pennycuick
step
and
poise
well
she
was
a
great
lady
and
carried
herself
accordingly
her
old
lover
was
charmed
he
held
her
hand
and
would
have
held
it
thrice
as
long
and
looked
into
her
eyes
too
overcome
it
appeared
to
speak
how
do
you
do
she
said
evading
his
intense
gaze
what
a
man
you
are
for
dropping
on
one
in
this
unexpected
sensational
way
why
you
write
and
tell
me
you
were
around
she
made
a
movement
to
withdraw
her
hand
he
held
it
fast
debbie
said
he
in
quite
a
tremulous
voice
remarkable
in
one
constitutionally
so
and
debbie
you
turned
me
out
of
your
house
when
i
came
to
see
you
last
i
hope
you
have
a
different
welcome
for
me
this
time
to
the
best
of
my
belief
she
laughed
you
insisted
upon
going
i
am
sure
you
were
asked
to
stay
to
lunch
or
whatever
it
was
by
the
way
have
you
lunched
now
she
showed
concern
for
her
obligations
as
his
hostess
yes
thank
you
at
least
it
does
matter
he
had
to
relinquish
her
hand
and
when
she
immediately
made
towards
the
he
followed
and
arrested
her
let
us
have
our
talk
first
he
pleaded
i
do
want
anything
to
eat
until
i
know
until
i
feel
that
you
do
grudge
it
oh
i
do
grudge
it
she
took
him
literally
not
one
square
meal
at
any
rate
the
only
thing
i
am
obliged
to
grudge
is
for
any
length
of
time
to
single
gentlemen
but
that
is
not
a
question
of
hospitality
as
you
know
sit
down
and
tell
me
all
the
news
he
sat
down
she
also
about
two
yards
off
across
the
gulf
of
persian
rug
he
looked
at
her
steadily
you
are
angry
with
me
he
observed
why
debbie
is
it
still
the
old
quarrel
after
all
these
years
then
her
face
changed
like
a
filled
lamp
when
you
put
a
match
to
it
she
said
in
a
deep
breathless
way
do
you
know
how
many
years
it
is
more
in
sorrow
and
surprise
than
in
anger
he
guessed
her
meaning
after
a
moment
thought
is
that
my
fault
the
number
of
years
has
been
of
your
choosing
he
pointed
out
forbearingly
you
sent
me
away
when
i
never
wanted
to
go
you
broke
it
off
altogether
against
my
wish
you
never
relented
never
made
a
sign
even
now
i
come
back
uninvited
it
was
a
clear
case
and
all
he
asked
for
was
bare
justice
why
did
you
come
before
uninvited
why
did
you
come
back
to
me
when
i
was
poor
and
lonely
claud
i
have
been
in
every
sort
of
trouble
my
father
is
dead
i
have
lost
all
my
sisters
in
one
way
and
another
i
have
been
living
in
cheap
lodgings
doing
without
what
i
always
thought
were
the
necessaries
of
life
to
keep
francie
going
and
to
get
debts
paid
off
i
have
been
ill
i
have
been
unhappy
i
have
sometimes
been
penniless
and
you
have
carefully
passed
by
on
the
other
side
like
that
man
in
the
bible
and
left
me
to
my
fate
he
was
genuinely
shocked
he
knew
that
she
had
been
horribly
down
in
the
world
but
not
that
she
had
suffered
to
this
extent
seeing
her
sitting
there
in
her
beautiful
gown
in
her
beautiful
room
without
one
trace
of
those
sordid
years
about
her
his
heart
ached
to
think
of
them
my
darling
i
never
knew
why
not
she
said
swiftly
because
you
never
tried
to
know
never
cared
to
know
but
now
that
i
can
be
a
credit
to
you
again
the
moment
you
hear
that
i
have
had
a
great
fortune
left
to
me
now
you
come
back
do
you
mean
to
say
he
demanded
sternly
that
you
think
you
honestly
think
i
have
come
back
to
you
on
account
of
your
money
she
returned
his
cold
searching
gaze
in
kind
honestly
she
said
i
do
think
so
there
is
no
way
out
of
it
he
rose
deliberately
bowed
to
her
and
picked
up
his
hat
he
was
not
really
mercenary
or
if
he
was
he
did
not
know
it
and
he
was
as
intensely
proud
as
she
was
he
felt
that
he
had
received
the
deadliest
insult
ever
dealt
him
in
his
life
and
one
that
he
could
never
forget
or
forgive
without
another
word
he
turned
to
the
door
and
walked
out
she
stood
still
and
watched
him
go
a
calm
smile
curving
her
lips
a
very
cyclone
of
passion
tearing
through
her
heart
and
she
scorned
to
recall
him
chapter
xxi
deb
yearned
to
have
her
australian
sisters
frances
was
european
with
her
at
redford
as
in
the
old
days
she
hated
to
be
luxuriating
there
without
them
but
for
a
time
the
husbands
stood
in
the
way
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
ask
them
too
the
draper
she
hardly
knew
at
all
in
her
correspondence
with
rose
his
name
was
rarely
mentioned
by
either
except
in
comprehensive
messages
at
the
end
of
letters
and
bennet
goldsworthy
company
deb
said
simply
made
her
ill
it
had
made
her
ill
since
after
her
father
death
the
clergyman
had
permitted
himself
in
her
hearing
to
vent
his
personal
disappointment
at
the
unexpected
smallness
of
his
wife
inheritance
the
man
had
presumed
to
take
the
air
of
one
reasonably
aggrieved
he
had
even
dropped
angry
words
about
deception
in
the
first
heat
of
his
chagrin
as
if
said
haughty
deb
it
was
not
enough
for
him
to
have
married
one
of
us
when
he
was
understood
to
say
that
he
had
arranged
his
life
in
accordance
with
the
expectations
he
had
been
given
the
right
to
entertain
deb
withering
comment
was
as
if
his
life
matters
but
she
was
intolerant
in
her
dislikes
poor
mr
goldsworthy
incurable
cadger
that
he
was
was
bound
to
feel
the
family
reverses
acutely
when
he
had
married
miss
pennycuick
for
her
good
in
that
risky
manner
he
had
naturally
expected
to
be
rewarded
for
the
deed
if
ever
it
be
safe
to
trust
to
appearances
it
had
seemed
safe
then
so
far
as
the
solidity
of
the
position
was
concerned
they
had
imposed
upon
him
with
their
careless
splendour
they
had
misled
him
by
their
condonation
of
the
marriage
which
restored
mary
to
her
privileges
as
a
daughter
of
the
house
most
thoroughly
had
they
taken
him
in
by
that
voluntary
wedding
gift
of
five
hundred
pounds
with
his
habit
which
he
took
to
be
the
general
habit
of
getting
all
he
could
and
giving
nothing
that
he
was
not
obliged
to
give
he
could
not
understand
the
airy
flinging
away
of
all
that
money
when
there
was
no
call
for
it
only
as
a
proof
that
mr
pennycuick
had
more
than
he
needed
for
all
the
legitimate
claims
on
him
and
the
old
man
had
said
again
and
again
that
his
daughters
would
share
and
share
alike
in
whatever
he
had
to
leave
when
mr
bentley
the
new
parson
came
young
sincere
devoted
a
poor
preacher
and
a
hard
worker
who
refused
to
batten
on
redford
bounty
all
the
old
furniture
of
the
parsonage
was
made
over
to
him
on
time
payment
and
the
goldsworthys
began
life
in
melbourne
on
the
basis
of
a
rich
wife
it
was
surprising
how
the
legend
grew
amongst
his
set
that
mr
goldsworthy
had
a
rich
wife
that
she
might
dress
the
part
on
all
occasions
so
that
there
would
be
no
mistake
about
it
the
trousseau
was
added
to
it
was
also
subtracted
from
for
the
simplicity
that
was
her
taste
and
distinction
was
hateful
in
his
sight
when
she
looked
common
in
a
cotton
gown
she
lowered
his
dignity
in
the
world
and
amongst
his
professional
fellows
supposed
to
be
so
envious
of
it
in
spite
of
her
red
face
deb
had
had
to
suffer
the
shock
of
seeing
her
sister
in
silk
of
a
morning
more
than
once
and
it
had
been
reported
to
her
though
she
did
not
believe
it
that
mary
wore
a
jewelled
necklace
to
church
on
sundays
deb
did
not
go
to
bennet
church
which
was
fortunately
a
long
way
from
her
home
and
she
had
been
to
his
melbourne
house
but
twice
on
her
first
visit
she
had
penetrated
to
mary
room
and
been
horrified
to
find
the
husband
clothes
hung
up
in
it
from
her
and
his
razors
and
brushes
mixed
up
with
her
things
on
her
the
arrangement
in
the
country
parsonage
was
to
be
accounted
for
to
find
it
here
made
deliberately
and
of
malice
prepense
was
to
see
what
gulfs
now
yawned
between
mary
old
life
and
the
new
one
deb
reached
forth
for
a
comb
and
drew
back
her
hand
as
if
she
had
inadvertently
touched
a
snake
mary
red
face
went
purple
as
she
explained
that
there
was
not
space
in
that
house
for
a
there
was
space
enough
going
to
waste
in
the
where
deb
had
her
feelings
hurt
on
her
second
visit
it
was
a
very
large
room
sharing
the
front
of
the
house
with
a
large
study
and
behind
them
all
the
other
rooms
huddled
as
of
no
account
none
of
them
bigger
than
keziah
redford
storeroom
the
study
was
sacred
to
the
master
of
the
house
the
to
company
one
look
showed
deb
that
mary
never
sat
there
and
that
it
was
not
she
who
had
chosen
and
arranged
the
furniture
the
foundation
of
the
scheme
was
a
costly
suite
upholstered
in
palish
silk
brocade
the
separate
pieces
standing
at
fixed
intervals
apart
on
a
gorgeous
axminster
carpet
when
deb
entered
the
room
mr
goldsworthy
was
bending
over
the
central
sofa
excited
and
talking
loudly
miss
goldsworthy
and
mary
stood
by
mute
and
drooping
ruby
looked
on
irresponsibly
with
joy
in
her
eye
what
the
matter
inquired
deb
advancing
as
she
was
not
a
great
lady
then
but
quite
the
contrary
mr
goldsworthy
explained
what
was
the
matter
with
scarcely
any
modification
of
his
minatory
air
a
caller
had
called
yesterday
bringing
with
her
a
little
boy
mary
had
thoughtlessly
fed
the
little
boy
with
soft
cake
and
the
little
boy
had
first
made
his
hands
sticky
with
it
and
then
pawed
the
sofa
which
had
cost
him
nearly
twenty
pounds
part
of
mary
pounds
greasy
marks
had
been
left
on
that
lovely
brocade
for
which
he
not
she
had
given
shillings
a
yard
and
which
he
had
forbidden
children
to
be
allowed
to
sit
on
as
if
that
were
not
bad
enough
they
those
two
poor
women
had
without
telling
him
tried
to
take
the
marks
out
with
some
wretched
chemist
stuff
which
had
not
taken
them
out
but
only
spread
them
more
now
the
sofa
was
completely
spoiled
and
what
to
do
he
did
not
know
unless
he
could
match
the
brocade
which
was
scarcely
likely
and
ill
could
he
afford
to
be
buying
brocade
and
so
on
finally
he
went
out
to
consult
with
a
furniture
repairer
of
his
acquaintance
banging
doors
behind
him
deb
cast
a
scornful
glance
upon
the
smudged
brocade
what
a
fuss
about
nothing
she
brushed
the
subject
by
my
brother
is
very
particular
about
this
room
miss
goldsworthy
apologised
for
him
so
i
see
and
he
is
very
fond
of
this
brocade
which
he
chose
himself
it
certainly
is
very
pretty
do
you
think
so
but
too
delicate
to
wear
well
i
am
always
frightened
to
see
children
go
near
it
or
even
people
when
it
has
been
raining
or
if
they
have
been
gathering
dust
it
does
show
every
spot
so
and
it
was
the
fault
i
signed
to
mary
to
give
him
a
biscuit
but
his
mother
picked
out
that
cake
which
had
jam
in
it
it
is
very
unfortunate
i
wonder
at
his
being
vexed
why
do
you
have
chintz
covers
moll
oh
he
would
like
it
to
be
covered
up
miss
goldsworthy
struck
in
and
seemed
shocked
herself
at
the
suggested
waste
mary
lifted
dull
eyes
to
her
sister
face
come
and
have
some
tea
she
said
come
auntie
it
is
no
use
your
worrying
yourself
and
they
went
into
the
poky
living
room
which
smelt
of
meals
and
had
tea
and
the
sort
of
barren
talk
that
the
presence
of
the
third
person
necessitated
mary
seemed
purposely
to
avoid
a
when
miss
goldsworthy
went
to
fetch
the
baby
ruby
was
kept
at
her
side
only
when
the
boy
appeared
did
mary
brighten
into
a
likeness
to
her
old
self
she
was
a
born
mother
and
her
child
consoled
her
then
in
the
midst
of
the
baby
worship
back
came
the
still
agitated
husband
and
father
the
furniture
man
with
him
and
the
house
was
filled
anew
with
the
affair
of
the
soiled
sofa
so
that
presence
as
also
her
departure
attracted
little
attention
as
her
pushed
out
a
valedictory
hand
she
noticed
a
that
had
the
grime
of
days
upon
it
he
economises
in
the
wash
she
soliloquised
with
wrinkling
nostril
and
curling
lip
and
in
those
filthy
cheap
coals
that
choke
the
grate
with
dust
and
in
tea
that
is
undrinkable
oh
what
a
house
and
she
had
not
been
there
since
but
now
her
benevolence
embraced
the
world
and
the
world
included
bennet
goldsworthy
it
was
no
longer
in
his
power
to
make
her
feel
ill
the
sun
of
her
prosperity
shining
on
him
at
her
sister
side
poor
struggling
little
man
gave
him
a
pathetic
and
appealing
interest
in
fact
it
was
to
him
that
her
maternal
dispositions
towards
her
family
drew
her
first
thank
god
she
said
to
herself
i
can
now
make
things
a
bit
easier
for
that
poor
child
she
wo
let
me
i
daresay
but
he
will
she
took
the
humble
tram
to
their
suburb
and
rang
at
their
parsonage
door
having
considerately
sent
word
that
she
was
coming
due
preparations
had
been
made
to
receive
her
she
was
shown
into
the
which
had
not
a
displaced
chair
and
where
the
axminster
and
the
cherished
brocade
still
looked
as
good
as
new
almost
her
first
act
was
to
search
for
the
grease
marks
on
the
sofa
the
spot
was
indicated
by
a
bleached
patch
and
she
sat
down
on
it
alone
for
a
few
minutes
on
this
occasion
the
old
aunt
had
been
ordered
to
keep
in
the
background
ruby
also
after
due
consideration
of
her
claims
had
been
denied
the
share
she
clamoured
for
of
the
impending
excitement
and
sent
out
of
the
house
mary
had
had
her
directions
and
remained
invisible
for
a
time
she
was
employed
in
getting
robert
ready
for
inspection
brushing
his
best
jacket
tying
his
best
while
he
jerked
about
under
her
hands
and
freely
criticised
her
labours
on
his
behalf
for
robert
took
after
his
father
as
a
knowing
person
he
was
in
fact
a
bright
and
clever
lad
who
knew
some
things
better
than
his
mother
did
she
was
ever
proud
to
admit
it
but
his
own
open
acceptance
of
superiority
and
readiness
to
keep
it
before
her
eyes
at
all
times
was
one
of
the
secret
crosses
of
her
life
weighed
down
with
so
many
however
if
you
marry
the
wrong
man
you
can
not
expect
to
have
the
right
children
and
it
was
something
that
this
boy
had
the
genuineness
of
his
intellectual
gifts
to
give
her
an
excuse
to
adore
him
there
that
will
do
it
is
very
bad
form
you
know
to
be
so
fussy
about
people
coming
and
so
anxious
about
what
they
may
think
about
you
the
young
authority
upon
etiquette
instructed
the
gentlewoman
who
had
done
him
the
honour
to
be
his
mother
and
mary
took
the
rebuke
humbly
bennet
goldsworthy
alone
came
softly
into
the
to
receive
the
distinguished
guest
he
had
grown
fat
and
tubby
and
a
phrase
of
claud
dalzell
flashed
into
deb
memory
as
she
marked
the
manner
of
his
approach
that
crawling
ass
that
would
lick
your
boots
for
sixpence
the
noonday
sun
does
not
affect
polished
metal
more
obviously
than
deb
wealth
affected
him
this
is
good
of
you
he
murmured
brokenly
pressing
her
gloved
hand
this
is
indeed
good
of
you
i
ought
to
have
been
before
she
returned
graciously
it
was
so
easy
to
be
gracious
to
him
now
i
have
been
wanting
to
come
but
you
can
not
imagine
how
many
hindrances
i
have
had
oh
but
i
can
indeed
with
earnest
emphasis
i
can
indeed
and
have
grieved
that
i
was
not
able
to
be
of
some
service
to
you
in
your
your
very
difficult
position
i
did
not
like
to
seem
to
force
myself
upon
you
but
i
hoped
i
confidently
hoped
that
you
would
send
for
me
if
it
was
in
my
power
to
be
of
the
slightest
assistance
to
you
oh
yes
thank
you
so
much
if
i
had
needed
anybody
but
there
were
only
too
many
kind
friends
aha
yes
i
expect
so
his
eye
lighted
and
his
lip
curled
craftily
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
of
that
the
carcase
is
you
know
the
rest
i
am
not
a
carcase
she
rallied
him
playfully
for
quite
the
first
time
in
her
life
no
indeed
i
should
have
said
ah
my
dear
de
miss
pennycuick
you
will
find
plenty
and
to
spare
of
friends
professing
anxiety
to
serve
you
when
their
only
object
is
to
serve
themselves
i
expect
so
she
assented
smiling
so
young
a
girl
subtle
flattery
this
now
that
deb
was
in
her
late
thirties
to
be
suddenly
called
to
a
position
of
such
immense
danger
and
responsibility
but
cheeringly
i
said
when
i
heard
of
it
that
mr
thornycroft
had
justified
my
high
opinion
of
his
judgment
and
character
it
is
not
often
that
great
wealth
comes
into
hands
so
worthy
of
it
i
am
afraid
they
are
not
very
worthy
sighed
deb
mr
goldsworthy
knew
better
he
knew
her
better
not
only
from
personal
intercourse
the
observation
and
intuition
of
a
man
trained
to
read
character
but
from
the
loving
representations
of
his
dear
wife
where
is
she
miss
pennycuick
asked
abruptly
not
out
i
hope
out
hardly
she
will
be
here
in
a
moment
i
am
afraid
when
you
see
her
you
will
think
her
looking
delicate
the
state
of
her
health
is
a
matter
of
the
most
anxious
concern
to
me
what
is
the
matter
with
her
health
she
was
always
well
at
home
we
used
to
think
her
the
strongest
of
the
family
until
until
she
fell
into
the
clutches
of
that
dreadful
man
mr
goldsworthy
concluded
for
her
oh
deb
coloured
and
frowned
that
is
not
what
i
was
going
to
say
what
she
had
really
been
going
to
say
was
until
her
marriage
and
why
do
you
rake
up
that
old
story
i
thought
it
had
all
been
forgotten
long
ago
it
has
been
unpleasantly
revived
said
mr
goldsworthy
solemnly
and
it
is
my
duty
to
tell
you
about
it
if
you
have
not
heard
deb
looked
equally
annoyed
and
alarmed
what
has
been
revived
she
asked
he
dropped
his
voice
apologetically
i
have
been
hearing
of
his
going
on
in
exactly
the
same
way
with
another
oh
sighed
deb
relieved
that
it
was
not
mary
who
had
been
the
reviver
then
it
no
business
of
ours
thank
goodness
pardon
me
it
is
very
much
our
business
he
urged
weightily
i
grieve
to
tell
you
that
it
is
your
sister
mrs
ewing
who
is
implicated
in
the
affair
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
know
nothing
about
it
deb
knew
something
and
so
she
put
the
question
by
i
do
encourage
scandalmongers
mrs
ewing
is
young
and
thoughtless
and
pretty
which
naturally
lays
her
open
to
ill
natured
gossip
my
informant
is
one
of
the
least
of
women
she
is
a
person
of
the
highest
principle
ah
those
women
i
know
them
mr
goldsworthy
was
nonplussed
for
the
moment
he
could
not
accept
the
suggestion
that
deb
was
not
but
he
gave
up
his
informant
there
is
ample
evidence
that
the
man
is
mrs
ewing
lover
he
grieved
he
has
been
seen
with
her
in
the
most
equivocal
situations
i
do
wish
to
go
into
details
to
mention
things
unfit
for
a
young
girl
ears
i
hope
not
put
in
deb
her
patience
giving
out
i
am
not
fond
of
that
kind
of
talk
i
should
not
believe
either
in
any
nasty
tales
connected
with
my
sister
or
with
captain
carey
and
you
ought
not
to
listen
to
them
for
mary
sake
you
should
not
pander
to
your
ladies
you
should
tell
them
to
be
more
charitable
and
to
mind
their
own
business
a
year
ago
the
parson
would
have
taken
umbrage
at
this
rebuke
he
now
hastened
to
deprecate
displeasure
on
the
part
of
the
one
whom
of
all
the
world
he
most
desired
to
please
far
be
it
from
me
to
speak
ill
of
anyone
belonging
to
you
he
declared
solemnly
but
still
he
could
not
help
it
the
most
person
if
he
be
greedy
will
seek
to
ingratiate
himself
with
power
by
disparagement
of
rival
suitors
he
was
following
an
impulse
that
might
be
described
as
an
instinct
in
trying
to
weaken
deb
favour
towards
the
rest
of
her
relatives
in
order
to
concentrate
as
much
as
possible
upon
himself
to
push
back
as
it
were
the
hands
that
he
imagined
eagerly
outstretched
to
her
palm
upwards
that
the
more
might
be
dropped
into
his
own
he
asked
her
if
she
had
seen
mrs
breen
and
sighed
over
that
plebeian
connection
i
may
be
poor
said
he
but
i
do
come
of
a
good
family
it
is
unfortunate
perhaps
but
we
can
not
help
our
prejudices
it
is
a
ridiculous
prejudice
said
deb
especially
in
a
country
like
this
oh
it
is
it
is
i
own
it
but
well
you
know
she
brusquely
brought
him
back
to
the
question
of
mary
health
it
is
mary
that
i
want
to
hear
about
tell
me
before
she
comes
in
what
is
the
matter
with
her
he
was
willingly
confidential
she
has
worries
said
he
worries
that
you
my
dear
young
lady
in
your
position
know
nothing
of
would
not
understand
if
i
were
to
tell
you
i
have
been
in
positions
to
understand
most
kinds
of
worries
said
deb
what
are
they
money
worries
well
i
have
a
delicacy
in
oh
you
need
not
have
i
know
of
course
that
you
can
not
have
been
too
well
off
and
i
am
here
on
purpose
to
do
something
for
you
if
you
will
allow
me
there
was
no
need
to
beat
about
the
bush
she
knew
since
mary
was
out
of
hearing
me
exactly
if
you
do
mind
in
strict
confidence
of
course
no
need
to
trouble
her
and
i
shall
not
say
anything
he
told
her
with
fullness
and
fervour
when
he
had
expressed
his
too
fulsome
gratitude
i
have
done
my
best
miss
pennycuick
you
bade
me
be
good
to
her
i
gave
you
my
solemn
promise
and
i
can
conscientiously
say
that
i
have
kept
my
word
well
so
he
had
according
to
his
lights
he
had
been
an
exemplary
husband
but
circumstances
have
been
against
me
in
the
first
place
i
was
in
error
somewhat
as
you
know
in
regard
to
my
wife
expectations
from
her
father
i
did
not
marry
her
for
her
money
as
you
also
know
but
appearances
were
such
that
i
naturally
concluded
she
would
have
a
considerable
income
of
her
own
i
did
not
care
for
myself
one
way
or
the
other
but
i
was
glad
to
believe
that
there
would
be
the
means
to
continue
to
her
the
mode
of
life
that
she
had
been
used
to
i
acted
upon
this
supposition
false
as
it
turned
out
and
anticipated
most
imprudently
i
confess
the
little
fortune
that
i
imagined
to
be
secure
when
we
came
here
where
living
is
so
much
more
expensive
than
in
the
country
with
no
redford
to
draw
upon
i
surrounded
my
wife
with
the
comforts
that
were
her
due
and
which
i
fully
believed
she
had
every
right
to
he
waved
his
hand
over
the
still
blooming
axminster
carpet
and
the
brocaded
suite
the
family
was
not
allowed
to
sit
on
i
spent
we
spent
the
little
capital
represented
by
your
father
wedding
present
i
had
an
erroneous
idea
that
it
was
to
be
an
annual
allowance
pending
the
eventual
division
of
the
estate
and
then
well
then
you
know
what
happened
deb
nodded
did
you
she
inquired
feelingly
borrow
of
those
professional
she
was
prepared
to
be
very
sympathetic
in
that
case
but
mr
goldsworthy
repelled
the
suggestion
with
scorn
certainly
not
i
never
borrowed
money
in
my
life
i
struggled
and
scraped
and
saved
as
best
i
could
i
endeavoured
in
vain
to
augment
my
small
income
by
little
speculations
harmless
little
dabblings
in
mining
shares
i
but
i
wo
bore
you
with
these
disagreeables
pulling
himself
up
with
an
air
of
forced
cheerfulness
but
i
want
to
know
said
deb
you
spoke
of
worries
worries
worries
now
are
you
still
he
spread
his
hands
and
wagged
his
head
i
rather
not
talk
about
our
troubles
he
sighed
i
do
want
to
dim
the
sunshine
of
your
and
suddenly
his
eye
flashed
and
his
brow
contracted
with
annoyance
mary
somewhat
hesitatingly
to
be
sure
walked
in
robert
had
insisted
that
the
pater
was
all
wrong
in
his
idea
that
it
was
proper
for
him
alone
to
receive
the
visitor
and
for
the
mistress
of
the
house
to
linger
inhospitably
after
it
was
known
that
she
must
know
of
the
visitor
arrival
robert
had
coerced
his
mother
into
doing
the
correct
thing
politely
he
opened
the
door
for
her
that
of
course
was
absolutely
the
correct
thing
and
escorted
her
forward
with
the
aplomb
of
a
man
of
the
world
nicely
blended
with
the
respectfulness
appropriate
to
a
nephew
and
a
ah
here
she
is
mr
goldsworthy
exclaimed
heartily
the
sisters
were
at
once
in
each
other
arms
deb
pierced
to
the
heart
by
mary
aged
and
faded
looks
was
the
most
demonstrative
of
the
two
mary
struck
her
after
a
moment
as
being
a
little
reserved
and
chilly
as
if
on
the
watch
to
repel
benevolence
as
soon
as
it
should
take
tangible
form
deb
understood
and
was
warned
to
be
circumspect
and
this
is
our
boy
grown
out
of
knowledge
eh
mary
stepped
swiftly
aside
to
let
robert
come
forward
and
there
was
no
mistaking
the
sentiments
held
in
common
by
the
parents
with
regard
to
their
son
their
two
faces
were
mirrors
for
each
other
suffused
with
the
same
tender
pride
perhaps
the
child
has
reconciled
her
to
the
rest
of
it
deb
hazarded
a
hope
she
may
be
happy
for
mary
smiled
and
moved
alertly
about
the
room
she
accepted
her
husband
ostentatious
hand
and
chair
and
when
he
resumed
the
conversation
or
rather
restarted
it
on
the
subject
of
achievements
at
school
she
followed
where
he
led
so
long
as
he
did
not
seem
leading
towards
deb
pocket
backing
him
up
in
the
most
wifely
manner
can
it
be
possible
deb
kept
asking
herself
glad
at
heart
to
see
such
signs
which
yet
lessened
her
pity
for
and
interest
in
her
sister
but
mary
with
all
the
pride
of
the
pennycuicks
in
her
was
not
one
to
let
on
her
skeleton
was
locked
tight
in
the
cupboard
it
belonged
to
when
visitors
were
about
especially
such
a
visitor
as
this
and
also
when
they
were
not
about
so
far
as
she
could
have
it
so
so
that
a
sort
of
air
of
entertaining
company
pervaded
the
room
deb
felt
a
constraint
with
her
sister
and
that
she
was
making
no
way
with
her
mission
but
robert
stepped
into
the
breach
with
mary
son
the
impulsive
lady
of
redford
was
unexpectedly
pleased
there
was
not
a
trace
of
pennycuick
to
be
discerned
in
him
nevertheless
he
was
a
intelligent
and
interesting
boy
he
sat
by
her
on
the
sacred
brocaded
sofa
while
she
brightly
questioned
him
brightly
answering
her
with
aptness
and
good
sense
his
parents
beaming
on
the
pair
even
the
father
content
to
play
second
fiddle
to
give
the
son
his
chance
here
at
any
rate
thought
deb
was
material
to
hand
for
the
work
she
had
come
to
do
i
love
boys
she
remarked
and
so
she
did
as
some
people
love
dogs
and
robert
and
i
are
going
to
be
great
friends
are
we
robert
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
say
so
aunt
robert
replied
with
characteristic
propriety
but
do
you
know
i
do
think
i
shall
call
you
robert
she
went
on
it
has
a
prim
sound
but
it
was
the
primness
of
himself
that
she
wanted
to
break
down
and
it
does
suit
a
boy
of
your
tender
years
i
think
i
call
you
bob
if
you
do
mind
i
wish
you
would
he
adroitly
answered
her
what
is
your
bent
towards
in
the
way
of
a
career
bob
he
said
he
thought
the
law
to
be
a
judge
some
day
you
do
care
for
station
life
oh
he
does
his
father
eagerly
interposed
he
loves
it
but
he
has
had
so
few
chances
which
is
your
school
bob
a
seminary
of
no
repute
was
named
and
the
father
again
intervened
to
regret
that
it
was
not
one
of
the
public
schools
but
they
unfortunately
have
been
beyond
our
means
here
mary
broke
in
with
praises
of
the
seminary
it
had
such
an
excellent
headmaster
was
so
conveniently
situated
really
better
in
many
ways
than
one
of
the
great
schools
and
then
robert
broke
in
my
dear
mother
he
ejaculated
in
a
compassionate
and
forbearing
way
ah
bob
knows
it
is
not
better
laughed
deb
and
it
is
mary
you
are
no
authority
my
dear
which
of
the
public
schools
do
you
fancy
bob
he
mentioned
his
choice
and
the
university
scholarships
that
were
to
be
had
there
debbie
implored
mrs
goldsworthy
under
her
breath
hissed
her
husband
you
be
quiet
molly
deb
playfully
adjured
her
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
you
or
with
anybody
except
bob
and
me
you
come
and
spend
your
next
vacation
with
me
at
redford
bob
and
then
we
can
talk
it
all
over
together
she
nodded
to
him
meaningly
he
smiled
with
perfect
comprehension
how
can
we
thank
you
mr
goldsworthy
murmured
emotionally
for
he
also
understood
it
is
too
too
it
all
right
pater
the
remarkable
boy
silenced
him
aunt
deborah
knows
how
we
feel
about
it
mary
sat
in
stolid
silence
for
once
indifferent
to
her
husband
dumb
command
then
tears
welled
into
her
tired
eyes
she
pocketed
her
pride
for
her
child
sake
it
had
been
her
hopeless
longing
for
years
to
give
her
darling
splendid
abilities
full
scope
he
will
repay
you
debbie
she
said
ah
do
be
so
grudging
so
ungenerous
cried
deb
tea
and
cakes
were
brought
in
and
bob
as
he
was
thenceforth
to
be
styled
waited
upon
his
aunt
in
the
correctest
manner
he
had
by
this
time
taken
on
an
air
that
seemed
to
say
you
and
i
understand
the
ropes
you
must
excuse
these
poor
parents
of
mine
who
were
not
born
with
our
perceptions
and
deb
no
more
proof
against
this
sort
of
thing
than
meaner
mortals
had
a
feeling
of
special
proprietorship
in
him
which
she
found
pleasant
although
he
was
not
exactly
the
that
she
could
have
wished
which
of
course
it
would
have
been
preposterous
to
expect
in
a
son
of
bennet
goldsworthy
bennet
goldsworthy
accompanied
her
to
the
gate
when
she
went
away
forbidding
mary
to
expose
herself
hatless
to
the
wind
and
there
the
benevolent
aunt
intentions
were
more
distinctly
formulated
i
wish
to
take
entire
charge
of
his
education
if
you
will
allow
me
he
is
a
very
promising
boy
and
should
have
all
his
chances
let
me
send
him
to
the
melbourne
grammar
after
christmas
and
as
a
boarder
if
you
do
mind
there
are
such
advantages
both
in
position
and
for
study
in
living
at
the
school
i
leave
everything
everything
in
your
hands
murmured
the
grateful
father
by
the
way
as
an
what
about
your
little
girl
she
was
not
a
little
girl
now
and
had
finished
with
school
but
oh
the
boon
that
a
few
good
lessons
in
music
and
languages
would
be
to
her
that
matter
was
settled
well
now
said
deb
we
must
think
about
mary
she
is
frightfully
thin
i
can
see
that
she
has
had
too
many
worries
as
you
say
she
must
be
taken
out
of
them
i
want
to
have
her
at
redford
with
me
as
soon
as
she
can
get
ready
and
give
her
a
good
long
rest
and
feed
her
up
and
make
her
fat
and
strong
i
only
wish
you
could
prevail
on
her
he
sighed
but
i
am
afraid
you
will
not
get
her
to
go
anywhere
without
me
i
have
a
devoted
wife
miss
pennycuick
even
if
she
had
not
tacitly
forbidden
deborah
in
her
poor
days
he
would
not
have
ventured
upon
the
liberty
now
that
she
was
rich
too
devoted
if
that
can
be
she
insists
upon
sharing
all
my
burdens
though
i
fain
would
spare
her
i
know
well
that
say
what
i
will
she
will
never
consent
to
leaving
me
to
struggle
with
them
alone
you
have
not
told
me
what
they
are
said
deb
who
saw
that
he
was
in
dread
of
her
going
before
he
could
do
so
oh
debts
debts
debts
he
answered
with
a
reckless
air
the
millstone
that
we
hung
about
our
necks
when
we
anticipated
that
she
would
have
money
and
lived
accordingly
and
were
then
left
stranded
the
eternal
trying
to
make
a
shilling
go
as
far
as
a
pound
to
make
bricks
without
straw
like
the
captive
israelites
of
old
but
why
do
you
ask
me
i
hate
to
talk
about
it
he
made
a
gesture
of
putting
the
miserable
subject
aside
it
was
very
hard
on
you
deb
said
gently
contradicting
the
deb
of
an
earlier
time
and
different
state
of
things
to
have
those
expectations
which
were
certainly
justified
and
to
be
disappointed
as
you
were
i
feel
that
we
pennycuicks
were
to
blame
in
that
oh
dear
no
he
earnestly
assured
her
and
that
an
obligation
rests
on
me
now
that
i
have
the
means
to
make
some
compensation
to
you
to
mary
rather
it
is
like
you
to
think
of
that
but
really
and
i
put
a
blank
cheque
in
my
pocket
and
a
stylographic
pen
and
will
you
let
me
she
drew
forth
the
articles
mentioned
and
made
a
desk
of
the
top
rail
of
the
gate
will
you
do
me
the
favour
to
accept
from
me
what
shall
i
say
five
hundred
pounds
would
that
relieve
you
and
mary
of
the
immediate
worries
he
said
it
would
with
the
mental
reservation
that
it
did
not
amount
to
what
he
had
been
defrauded
of
by
mr
pennycuick
she
had
made
a
mistake
in
the
designation
of
her
gift
but
the
slight
coolness
of
his
acknowledgement
quickly
gave
place
to
grateful
fervour
as
he
realised
what
the
immediate
five
hundred
pounds
would
do
for
him
and
read
in
her
words
an
implication
that
the
sum
was
but
an
instalment
of
what
she
felt
to
be
his
due
he
was
incoherent
in
his
thanks
and
benedictions
as
he
slipped
the
cheque
into
his
pocket
and
you
will
let
me
have
mary
at
redford
oh
yes
she
will
not
want
to
go
but
i
shall
make
her
and
do
not
tell
her
more
than
you
can
help
about
this
little
private
transaction
she
might
feel
i
will
tell
her
nothing
that
is
likely
to
vex
her
do
not
pray
do
not
only
take
these
sordid
worries
off
her
shoulders
and
give
her
what
she
needs
and
do
let
her
toil
and
moil
remember
it
is
for
her
i
do
it
there
was
a
little
sting
in
that
last
remark
but
he
was
too
happy
to
feel
it
chapter
xxii
now
what
to
do
for
rose
rose
had
written
warm
congratulations
to
her
sister
without
mentioning
any
desire
for
a
personal
interview
ever
since
her
marriage
she
had
refrained
from
giving
invitations
to
her
family
leaving
the
initiative
in
social
matters
to
them
a
mark
of
consideration
and
good
taste
on
her
part
which
they
had
quite
approved
of
and
intercourse
had
been
limited
to
afternoon
calls
more
or
less
affectionate
and
informal
but
stopping
short
at
meals
in
common
under
the
roof
of
either
party
now
however
deb
craved
for
a
fuller
sympathy
with
the
and
of
her
sisters
and
now
it
seemed
so
perfectly
easy
to
go
to
her
house
in
pursuit
of
it
she
despatched
an
impulsive
note
dearest
i
want
a
quiet
talk
with
you
about
all
that
has
happened
may
i
come
to
lunch
tomorrow
so
as
to
make
a
long
afternoon
of
it
if
not
convenient
fix
a
day
to
lunch
with
me
but
i
am
not
so
tied
as
you
are
and
besides
i
should
like
to
have
peter
advice
on
one
or
two
little
matters
of
business
if
it
would
not
bother
him
of
course
after
he
comes
from
town
do
keep
him
at
home
on
purpose
to
which
rose
replied
by
telegram
shall
expect
you
early
tomorrow
for
a
long
day
peter
delighted
to
place
himself
at
your
disposal
so
deb
set
off
next
morning
full
of
benevolent
intentions
to
gather
poor
humdrum
rose
and
her
in
his
way
truly
worthy
husband
into
the
sphere
of
her
golden
prosperity
also
incidentally
to
warm
herself
in
the
light
of
faithful
and
familiar
eyes
since
her
final
dismissal
of
claud
dalzell
although
she
was
satisfied
with
that
act
and
ready
to
repeat
it
again
if
necessary
she
had
been
conscious
of
a
personal
loneliness
not
sensibly
mitigated
by
her
wealth
someone
of
my
own
was
the
want
of
her
warm
heart
and
rose
with
no
petty
grudge
for
past
answered
that
need
with
open
arms
never
was
hostess
more
cordial
to
honoured
guest
peter
also
was
at
home
he
had
been
to
town
and
back
again
and
now
stood
upon
his
spotless
doorstep
and
anon
upon
his
handsome
hearthrug
determined
that
his
house
should
lack
nothing
befitting
the
great
occasion
it
was
all
in
gala
dress
flowers
festive
the
best
foot
foremost
and
yet
whereas
there
was
no
hiding
the
in
the
ingratiating
bennet
goldsworthy
there
was
no
finding
him
in
this
proud
host
and
husband
whose
desire
was
only
to
do
his
dear
wife
credit
neither
of
them
said
in
word
or
manner
why
did
you
come
like
this
before
deb
knew
that
her
welcome
would
have
been
the
same
and
had
hard
work
not
to
show
too
frankly
her
sense
of
their
magnanimity
as
it
was
she
nearly
kissed
peter
in
the
hall
such
a
nice
warm
comfortable
hospitable
entrance
to
as
comfortable
a
home
in
its
undeniably
style
as
she
had
ever
been
inside
of
the
more
striking
in
its
effect
by
contrast
with
mary
peter
cuffs
were
like
the
driven
snow
he
was
charmingly
fresh
and
clean
well
barbered
and
well
tailored
grown
quite
handsome
too
now
that
he
had
filled
out
and
matured
as
for
rose
i
hear
frances
wrote
from
paris
that
poor
rose
has
become
a
perfect
tub
mrs
peter
was
almost
as
broad
as
she
was
long
but
what
health
in
the
sunny
face
what
opulent
in
the
full
curves
of
her
figure
gowned
in
a
fashion
to
satisfy
even
deb
exigent
taste
they
did
not
tell
her
it
was
good
of
her
to
come
to
see
them
but
they
told
her
in
all
the
languages
of
courtesy
that
they
were
mighty
glad
she
had
come
she
was
taken
into
the
full
of
soft
chairs
and
sofas
that
anybody
might
sit
on
and
with
a
fire
of
clear
coals
in
a
grate
that
glittered
with
constant
polishing
but
everything
in
peter
establishment
seemed
to
shine
with
pure
cleanliness
he
took
after
his
mother
who
modest
in
other
things
was
fond
of
offering
a
sovereign
to
anybody
who
would
find
a
cobweb
in
her
house
deb
was
peeled
of
her
furs
by
peter
with
the
greatest
deference
and
politeness
but
with
none
of
the
obsequiousness
that
had
sickened
her
elsewhere
he
laid
down
her
sable
cloak
with
the
reverence
of
one
who
knew
its
value
and
he
asked
rose
in
a
whisper
if
her
sister
would
like
a
glass
of
wine
before
lunch
the
smiling
matron
shook
her
head
and
whispered
something
else
which
sent
him
out
of
the
room
then
while
he
skipped
about
in
the
background
attending
to
the
wines
and
beers
she
convoyed
the
guest
to
the
very
luxurious
bedroom
where
keziah
dandled
the
youngest
of
the
breen
children
the
rest
had
had
their
dinners
and
gone
out
so
as
not
to
be
made
too
much
of
by
a
silly
mother
if
it
could
be
helped
warm
was
the
greeting
between
keziah
and
her
late
mistress
and
many
the
questions
about
redford
and
the
old
folks
but
there
was
no
hint
that
mrs
moon
hankered
after
the
big
and
the
dignities
and
privileges
of
her
former
home
her
heart
was
with
rose
babies
now
there
what
do
you
think
of
this
she
demanded
as
she
proudly
displayed
her
charge
and
being
invited
thereto
condescendingly
laid
it
in
deb
outstretched
arms
it
was
a
pretty
healthy
creature
fat
dainty
and
about
two
months
old
still
in
the
whitest
and
finest
of
long
clothes
little
duck
deb
crooned
and
rubbed
her
cheek
almost
with
passion
on
its
skin
robert
nose
indeed
was
dislocated
on
the
spot
oh
rosie
she
presently
blurted
out
i
would
like
to
have
this
child
would
you
replied
rose
all
smiles
no
but
seriously
and
without
joking
i
really
would
you
know
i
daresay
laughed
the
plump
little
mother
and
her
laugh
was
echoed
by
keziah
as
she
passed
into
the
adjoining
nursery
to
leave
the
long
parted
sisters
to
themselves
now
look
here
the
guest
addressed
the
hostess
thoughtfully
and
deliberately
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
if
you
will
give
her
to
me
i
will
bring
her
up
and
educate
her
as
perfectly
as
care
and
money
can
do
it
she
shall
take
the
name
of
pennycuick
and
be
my
daughter
and
my
heiress
and
the
future
representative
of
the
family
and
she
added
for
her
own
inward
ear
we
can
live
at
home
or
somewhere
if
necessary
where
breens
and
such
will
not
have
the
chance
to
interfere
with
us
as
if
i
would
give
my
baby
away
rose
sweetly
jeered
her
even
for
a
kingdom
you
have
five
more
and
may
have
another
five
or
it
looks
like
it
but
none
to
spare
besides
you
wo
want
other
people
children
when
you
get
your
own
how
about
her
being
the
heiress
then
i
shall
never
have
children
of
my
own
said
deb
with
tightened
lips
that
is
why
i
want
to
adopt
one
rose
laughed
the
idea
to
scorn
of
course
you
will
cried
she
you
must
all
the
money
in
the
world
is
nothing
compared
with
a
baby
i
would
give
one
of
mine
for
twenty
fortunes
not
if
i
had
to
earn
their
keep
at
the
not
even
for
the
child
own
advantage
it
is
not
to
any
child
advantage
to
grow
up
thinking
that
its
mother
did
not
care
to
be
a
mother
to
it
said
rose
nor
yet
possibly
to
grow
up
to
look
down
on
her
rose
deb
guilty
face
flamed
scarlet
or
on
her
father
rose
continued
with
soft
but
firm
persistence
she
must
have
a
father
too
deb
and
peter
would
not
give
his
job
away
any
more
than
i
would
give
mine
he
thinks
the
world
of
them
all
he
is
just
as
good
a
father
as
he
is
a
husband
with
a
lift
of
head
and
lighting
of
eye
come
to
me
my
precious
as
the
baby
whimpered
come
to
its
own
mother
then
no
no
debbie
dear
you
be
a
mother
yourself
in
the
natural
and
proper
way
you
will
find
it
a
deal
better
than
being
rich
marry
some
good
kind
man
straight
away
before
you
waste
any
more
of
your
young
years
i
am
sure
there
must
be
dozens
dying
to
have
you
dying
to
have
the
handling
of
mr
thornycroft
money
said
deb
with
a
bitterness
that
surprised
her
sister
oh
no
said
she
you
are
sufficient
attraction
without
that
i
shall
never
know
it
but
this
thought
deb
is
a
very
turn
that
the
conversation
is
taking
these
people
and
rose
has
become
one
of
them
have
quite
the
tradesman
idea
of
marriage
any
kind
man
will
do
they
can
not
be
expected
to
understand
she
watched
rose
billowing
down
into
her
and
pretended
to
herself
that
she
was
not
envious
it
would
have
been
a
experiment
to
adopt
this
child
and
i
shall
probably
live
to
be
thankful
that
my
offer
was
refused
she
inwardly
argued
while
her
beautiful
eyes
melted
at
the
spectacle
of
the
happy
mother
snuggling
the
babe
to
her
bared
breast
it
is
a
charming
little
creature
now
but
it
would
probably
grow
up
common
whatever
its
education
and
environment
blood
will
tell
and
if
she
took
the
name
of
pennycuick
she
could
not
pass
it
on
after
all
a
boy
is
best
so
robert
goldsworthy
remained
in
the
position
his
gifts
had
gained
for
him
after
an
admirable
meal
in
the
course
of
which
deb
made
herself
most
charming
to
her
while
rose
retired
as
much
as
possible
from
the
conversation
in
order
that
he
might
shine
to
the
best
advantage
those
little
matters
of
business
that
had
been
mentioned
were
discussed
they
were
trifles
invented
for
the
purpose
of
compliments
to
mr
breen
and
the
serious
energy
with
which
he
applied
himself
to
each
case
and
his
exhaustive
treatment
of
it
showed
his
thorough
enjoyment
of
the
part
alloted
to
him
by
the
distinguished
woman
who
was
so
accomplished
in
the
art
of
giving
pleasure
especially
to
men
frankly
deb
always
preferred
a
man
to
talk
to
and
she
was
agreeably
surprised
to
find
that
peter
was
very
intelligent
and
acquainted
with
several
things
beside
shopkeeping
rose
was
simply
enchanted
to
find
herself
out
by
him
when
she
was
not
stealing
from
the
room
to
leave
the
coast
clear
she
was
beaming
over
her
needlework
in
the
background
still
as
a
mouse
not
by
word
or
look
would
she
spoil
his
chance
of
proving
to
deb
what
he
really
was
how
mistaken
in
him
she
and
the
others
had
been
it
was
peter
who
escorted
the
guest
round
the
garden
and
stables
mrs
peter
excusing
herself
in
the
greenhouse
miss
pennycuick
who
was
fond
of
flowers
obtained
that
she
declared
would
be
most
valuable
to
her
in
the
management
of
her
redford
houses
which
she
implied
that
he
must
see
in
the
interview
with
the
carriage
horse
rose
had
a
little
brougham
not
as
her
sisters
supposed
for
paying
calls
on
other
drapers
wives
which
she
had
small
leisure
for
but
for
shoppings
and
airings
and
taking
children
to
dentists
and
pantomimes
miss
pennycuick
was
instructive
in
her
turn
feeling
legs
and
advising
about
firing
and
bandages
with
the
recognised
authority
of
an
expert
old
bruce
padding
at
his
master
heels
was
greeted
by
name
patted
and
shaken
hands
with
as
if
he
had
never
abetted
rebels
and
the
discovery
of
a
litter
of
choice
puppies
gave
opportunity
for
the
making
of
a
little
present
which
was
graciously
received
after
tea
rose
was
invited
to
show
her
house
a
further
proof
of
her
sister
tact
and
powers
of
divination
now
peter
was
left
behind
he
used
the
opportunity
to
cut
flowers
for
deb
to
take
away
with
her
and
the
little
matron
was
in
her
glory
from
top
to
bottom
and
every
cupboard
and
corner
and
the
numerous
appliances
and
the
stocks
of
silver
linen
china
the
ample
furnishings
of
every
part
the
solid
goodness
of
every
bit
of
material
all
was
displayed
with
modest
pride
the
complacence
of
one
who
knows
there
is
nothing
to
hide
or
apologise
for
is
it
a
nice
home
debbie
could
any
woman
wish
for
a
better
home
she
asked
again
and
again
unable
to
restrain
herself
and
deb
with
a
few
secret
reservations
said
yes
and
no
with
kindly
warmth
thinking
to
herself
happy
child
to
be
satisfied
so
easily
how
much
happier
than
we
who
want
the
moon
i
often
wonder
why
i
am
so
blessed

poor
molly
who
deserved
so
much
more
lives
the
life
she
does
ah
deb
what
a
marriage
she
spoke
of
it
exactly
as
bennet
goldsworthy
had
spoken
of
hers
in
a
spirit
compounded
of
benevolence
and
contempt
the
former
element
preponderating
in
him
the
latter
in
her
at
the
moment
she
was
exhibiting
the
complete
appointments
of
peter
my
husband
may
be
a
draper
said
she
but
at
least
he
does
not
shave
in
my
room
the
survey
of
the
house
ended
at
the
nurseries
rose
had
purposely
left
the
best
till
last
her
throwing
open
of
the
door
revealed
a
picture
so
charming
that
it
persuaded
deb
to
accept
an
invitation
to
dinner
in
order
that
she
might
do
justice
to
it
oh
what
a
delightful
room
she
cried
as
her
eyes
ran
round
its
pictured
walls
glowing
in
the
evening
firelight
not
large
enough
now
the
smiling
mother
objected
we
are
going
to
build
new
ones
a
wing
at
the
back
and
turn
these
into
bedrooms
for
the
elder
children
who
will
soon
be
old
enough
to
have
their
own

what
little

jane
and
pennycuick
deb
started
at
the
name
and
was
uncertain
whether
it
pleased
her
or
not
in
this
connection
the
baby
but
one
in
the
tub
under
the
hands
of
old
keziah
are
they
not
sweet
they
really
were
full
of
life
and
fun
the
pride
of
the
maternal
heart
was
amply
justified
deb
plunged
into
the
group
delightedly
kissed
them
teased
them
tickled
them
did
everything
a
proper
aunt
should
do
and
rose
was
in
ecstasies
oh
debbie
she
pleaded
do
go
yet
stay
with
them
for
a
little
stay
and
see
baby
undressed
i
always
do
it
myself
and
have
a
bit
of
dinner
with
us
you
will
wo
you
give
me
my
nursing
apron
jane
as
she
tied
the
sheet
of
flannel
over
her
smart
gown
she
whispered
to
jane
go
down
and
tell
mr
breen
that
miss
pennycuick
is
going
to
stay
to
dinner
then
she
turned
up
her
sleeves
settled
herself
upon
a
low
chair
and
with
and
belaced
toilet
basket
and
warming
around
her
performed
the
task
that
made
this
hour
the
happiest
of
her
happy
day
as
closely
as
the
romping
children
allowed
deb
watched
her
and
marvelled
at
her
quick
skill
and
lightness
of
hand
who
would
have
thought
that
little
rose
could
be
so
clever
the
healthy
baby
so
deftly
handled
raised
no
protest
but
curled
her
toes
as
if
she
enjoyed
it
and
when
all
was
done
the
perfumed
creature
was
laid
to
its
young
mother
generous
breast
and
sucked
itself
to
sleep
in
five
minutes
deb
wistfully
observant
began
to
dimly
apprehend
that
to
wish
rose
marriage
undone
would
be
about
as
kind
as
to
wish
back
to
earth
the
dead
whom
we
believe
in
heaven
meanwhile
peter
had
been
bustling
about
after
such
dinner
arrangements
as
he
could
attend
to
mr
thornycroft
himself
had
never
taken
more
pains
to
please
this
guest
deb
enjoyed
strawberries
for
the
first
time
that
season
and
a
glass
of
wine
that
even
claud
could
not
have
carped
at
coffee
was
brought
to
the
from
which
rose
slipped
away
for
a
whispered
colloquy
with
her
husband
in
the
hall
the
result
of
which
was
that
they
came
in
together
to
ask
miss
pennycuick
to
do
them
the
honour
of
standing
godmother
to
the
baby
deb
put
the
crown
upon
the
gracious
day
by
promptly
consenting
but
that
she
thought
with
some
chagrin
as
she
rolled
homewards
or
rather
bedwards
with
peter
flowers
in
the
carriage
beside
her
that
is
the
extent
of
my
tether
in
this
direction
a
christening
mug
and
a
bit
of
jewellery
on
her
birthdays
i
shall
be
allowed
that
otherwise
i
can
be
of
no
more
use
to
them
than
if
i
were
a
workhouse
pauper
they
are
independent
of
me
and
of
everybody
chapter
xxiii
the
years
passed
and
the
destinies
of
our
friend
began
to
take
final
shape
the
bread
cast
upon
the
waters
returned
the
chickens
came
home
to
roost
one
winter
morning
captain
guthrie
carey
brought
his
ship
into
hobson
bay
the
agents
of
his
company
sent
letters
to
him
there
he
took
one
from
the
sheaf
and
read
it
carefully
read
it
four
times
then
he
tore
it
into
little
pieces
and
dropped
it
over
the
side
the
pilot
and
the
first
officer
wondered
at
the
concentrated
gravity
of
his
mien
at
the
faraway
look
in
his
cold
blue
eyes
yet
is
was
a
very
short
and
simple
letter
there
were
no
names
inside
and
it
merely
said
i
returned
by
last
mail
and
am
at
the
above
address
i
shall
be
at
home
tomorrow
afternoon
at
five
of
course
i
am
seeing
nobody
so
we
shall
be
quite
undisturbed
be
punctual
if
possible
the
above
address
was
the
big
house
that
had
belonged
to
the
late
mr
ewing
tomorrow
afternoon
was
but
an
hour
off
at
five
precisely
captain
carey
shed
his
ulster
in
the
palatial
vestibule
and
at
the
heels
of
a
marched
through
the
warm
hall
and
up
the
shallow
muffled
stairs
to
the
familiar
a
long
room
the
lower
end
of
which
was
in
shadow
and
the
upper
illuminated
like
a
shrine
with
rosy
lamps
projecting
from
a
forest
of
chimney
ornament
and
a
great
bright
red
fire
twinkling
upon
tiles
and
brass
the
big
palms
were
in
their
big
pots
spreading
and
bowing
over
settees
and
cosy
corners
every
bowl
and
vase
overflowed
with
the
choicest
flowers
although
it
was
wintry
june
and
the
was
ready
the
old
seductive
chairs
and
tables
were
grouped
upon
the
persian
hearthrug
in
the
old
way
with
the
sheltering
screen
half
round
them
indications
of
the
desire
of
the
mistress
of
the
house
to
give
him
special
welcome
were
too
marked
and
many
to
be
ignored
he
was
left
here
to
meditate
in
solitude
for
a
few
minutes
and
he
did
all
the
meditating
that
was
possible
in
the
time
his
heart
thumped
rather
faster
than
was
necessary
but
his
strong
face
was
a
picture
of
composed
determination
indeed
it
was
not
easy
to
recognise
the
young
guthrie
carey
of
old
redford
days
in
this
stern
tough
substantial
man
steady
as
a
rock
amid
the
winds
and
waves
of
incalculable
fate
just
now
he
had
the
look
of
a
military
commander
braced
for
a
pitched
battle
and
the
has
been
won
for
many
a
less
courageous
enterprise
than
that
on
which
he
was
now
engaged
leaning
his
broad
shoulders
on
the
ledge
of
the
mantelpiece
and
roasting
his
stout
calves
at
the
glorious
fire
he
watched
the
distant
doorway
with
narrowed
but
eyes
when
he
saw
the
dim
curtain
lift
to
let
in
the
light
from
the
landing
and
a
slim
figure
he
straightened
himself
and
set
his
teeth
hard
it
had
to
be
faced
and
fought
he
felt
and
the
sooner
it
was
over
the
better
for
them
both
she
came
fluttering
up
to
him
with
both
hands
held
out
how
white
they
were
against
the
crape
and
how
wonderfully
her
complexion
and
her
hair
were
set
off
by
the
black
robe
and
the
fine
lawn
bands
at
throat
and
wrists
he
loathed
the
mockery
of
the
widow
weeds
but
thought
he
had
never
seen
her
look
so
lovely
oh
guthrie
oh
what
years
it
seems
were
you
wondering
what
had
become
of
me
but
i
could
somehow
i
did
feel
that
i
could
before
she
cast
herself
into
his
arms
in
the
most
natural
way
in
the
world
he
laid
one
of
them
round
her
waist
lightly
and
kissed
her
brow
then
when
she
lifted
it
for
the
purpose
her
mouth
the
sweetest
mouth
that
ever
made
a
pair
of
soft
eyes
omnipotent
after
some
seconds
of
silence
she
looked
at
him
questioningly
all
with
nervous
excitement
her
delicate
cheek
was
pink
like
a
la
france
rose
it
was
so
good
of
you
to
come
she
murmured
humbly
it
was
it
did
bother
you
you
were
not
wanting
to
do
something
else
were
you
dear
there
was
revealed
in
tone
and
manner
the
fact
that
even
selfish
frances
had
come
to
care
for
something
more
than
for
herself
no
oh
no
he
replied
rather
breathlessly
i
was
going
up
the
country
this
afternoon
but
fortunately
i
got
your
letter
in
time
oh
if
you
had
what
should
i
have
done
i
could
stand
it
any
longer
guthrie
it
is
four
whole
months
since
though
it
seems
like
yesterday
and
how
are
you
he
broke
in
taking
a
fresh
grip
of
the
sword
as
it
were
he
held
her
off
from
him
glancing
at
her
shoulder
her
skirt
anything
but
her
eyes
which
were
her
sword
and
deadly
oh
do
look
at
me
she
exclaimed
shrinking
i
hate
myself
in
this
horrible
gown
i
feel
so
mean
and
hypocritical
though
i
do
mourn
for
him
guthrie
you
must
not
think
i
feel
happy
because
he
is
dead
no
indeed
i
wish
i
could
but
one
must
conform
to
a
certain
extent
must
one
and
every
respect
that
i
can
possibly
show
to
his
memory
especially
after
the
way
he
has
treated
me
i
suppose
you
heard
what
guthrie
had
heard
but
asked
the
question
to
fill
time
five
thousand
a
year
said
she
at
my
absolute
and
entire
disposal
with
no
restriction
or
condition
of
any
sort
or
kind
she
made
the
announcement
in
a
level
tone
and
without
a
smile
but
he
detected
the
triumph
and
satisfaction
underneath
and
feeling
much
the
stronger
for
it
he
observed
gravely
that
the
dead
man
was
a
good
man
and
i
always
knew
it
francie
worse
luck
oh
so
did
i
far
far
too
good
for
the
likes
of
me
but
well
we
need
not
talk
about
that
now
we
could
help
ourselves
could
we
and
the
past
is
past
everything
is
different
now
oh
guthrie
what
it
is
to
kiss
you
without
feeling
that
i
am
doing
wrong
she
kissed
him
as
she
said
it
pressing
him
to
her
of
course
he
kissed
her
back
but
his
hands
on
her
waist
were
rigid
as
if
he
wore
an
evening
shirt
and
was
afraid
of
her
crushing
the
front
of
it
she
might
have
noticed
this
if
she
had
not
caught
a
glimpse
of
herself
at
the
moment
in
a
mirror
behind
him
one
thing
she
said
i
did
draw
the
line
at
i
positively
refused
to
wear
a
cap
i
knew
i
knew
you
could
have
borne
that
holding
her
charming
head
rippled
all
over
with
goldenchestnut
curls
and
coils
just
in
front
of
his
eyes
she
pleaded
for
confirmation
of
this
statement
you
could
have
stood
seeing
me
in
a
cap
could
you
guthrie
as
far
as
i
can
judge
he
replied
nobody
asks
you
to
wear
caps
these
days
whether
you
a
widow
or
not
why
the
very
grandmothers
go
about
in
yellow
fringes
and
things
pretending
they
are
thirty
or
forty
when
everybody
knows
they
are
twice
that
at
the
least
when
i
was
a
youngster
there
used
to
be
old
ladies
my
mother
was
one
but
the
race
has
died
out
i
at
any
rate
am
not
an
old
lady
mrs
ewing
remarked
with
a
joyous
smile
my
yellow
fringes
and
things
are
all
my
own
and
so
is
my
complexion
and
so
are
my
teeth
her
smile
widened
to
reveal
their
pearly
excellence
she
took
his
hand
and
rubbed
the
back
of
it
on
her
downy
cheek
and
laid
the
palm
on
her
soft
thick
locks
even
yet
she
did
not
see
that
anything
was
the
matter
confident
in
her
still
young
beauty
and
in
the
fact
that
he
now
knew
for
certain
that
the
bulk
of
her
husband
property
was
hers
how
often
she
had
wondered
whether
he
knew
or
not
feeling
sure
that
he
must
have
heard
the
news
at
some
of
the
many
ports
he
had
put
into
since
it
had
become
a
matter
of
public
knowledge
and
why
he
allowed
days
and
weeks
even
months
to
pass
without
making
a
sign
there
had
always
been
the
cables
anyway
she
put
it
down
to
his
delicacy
his
sense
of
the
awkwardness
of
the
situation
his
consideration
for
her
we
will
have
tea
first
she
said
touching
the
then
we
shall
not
be
disturbed
any
more
we
can
talk
till
oh
how
i
wish
you
could
stay
for
dinner
and
a
long
long
evening
but
it
is
better
not
to
do
things
of
that
sort
yet
do
you
think
better
not
to
run
risks
of
making
scandal
now
that
there
no
longer
any
need
for
it
much
better
said
captain
carey
firmly
and
after
all
there
are
lots
of
ways
that
we
can
meet
without
doing
anything
improper
i
have
thought
of
heaps
i
can
go
to
sydney
i
can
go
home
for
that
matter
i
am
a
perfectly
free
agent
and
we
have
now
less
than
of
a
year
guthrie
i
want
you
to
let
me
have
the
twelve
months
good
it
is
a
long
wait
i
know
but
we
should
feel
the
benefit
of
it
afterwards
she
glanced
down
the
room
in
alarm
and
saw
the
door
open
to
admit
the
servant
she
had
summoned
he
brought
teapot
and
kettle
hot
cakes
and
muffins
and
arranged
them
with
unnecessary
carefulness
on
the
little
table
by
the
fireside
hostess
and
guest
watched
his
slow
manoeuvres
with
an
impatient
but
fascinated
gaze
and
tried
to
think
about
something
to
talk
about
for
his
edification
and
could
not
thank
you
willis
that
will
do
willis
i
ring
if
i
want
anything
else
i
do
know
captain
carey
whether
you
are
one
of
those
people
who
despise
tea
and
cake
they
were
alone
once
more
captain
carey
refused
the
proffered
refreshment
mrs
ewing
making
no
effort
to
persuade
him
took
a
few
mouthfuls
hastily
then
she
set
her
cup
down
and
with
a
quick
flirt
of
the
hand
extinguished
the
two
pink
lamps
they
were
too
we
do
want
lights
to
talk
by
she
said
in
a
casual
way
the
firelight
is
enough
i
think
firelight
at
this
hour
so
much
the
pleasantest
do
you
oh
yes
he
responded
desperately
and
indeed
was
glad
of
the
shelter
of
a
shadow
on
his
face
but
he
said
to
himself
with
clenched
hands
and
a
long
indrawn
breath
now
comes
the
a
very
large
and
wide
sofa
low
full
of
springs
and
down
pillows
stood
in
the
cosy
firelight
a
great
tall
curving
screen
behind
it
mrs
ewing
as
she
had
done
many
times
before
crossed
over
to
this
sofa
sank
into
its
yielding
depths
and
looking
up
at
her
companion
patted
the
empty
seat
beside
her
the
man
hesitated
for
an
instant
and
then
as
he
had
done
many
times
before
obeyed
the
significant
gesture
but
now
the
time
for
preparation
for
hesitation
had
expired
it
was
necessary
to
brace
himself
for
the
decisive
deed
even
as
she
clasped
her
hands
beneath
his
ear
he
unclasped
them
gently
but
firmly
and
drew
them
down
with
his
back
to
the
firelight
she
could
not
see
his
face
but
he
could
see
hers
and
the
swift
change
in
its
expression
she
was
puzzled
and
surprised
but
as
her
hands
were
still
held
fast
in
his
iron
fists
resting
on
his
knee
she
was
not
conscious
of
the
state
of
the
case
my
girl
he
said
clearing
his
throat
she
had
allowed
him
so
many
liberties
that
this
mode
of
address
was
quite
in
order
you
and
i
can
speak
plainly
to
each
other
there
no
need
for
us
to
beat
about
the
bush
is
there
of
course
not
she
replied
all
at
sea
as
to
what
this
portended
but
jumping
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
going
to
be
proud
about
the
money
it
would
be
an
odd
thing
if
we
took
to
being
shy
at
this
time
of
day
it
would
would
it
he
cleared
his
throat
again
and
made
a
fresh
start
look
here
francie
do
do
that
listen
to
me
child
i
am
not
a
child
sir
allow
me
to
inform
you
that
i
was
last
birthday
she
was
so
pleased
to
think
she
was
only
rich
and
free
with
her
life
in
her
hands
and
half
a
thirty
still
when
she
might
have
dragged
on
till
she
was
old
and
grey
or
in
her
grave
and
why
am
i
not
to
do
that
since
when
have
you
lost
your
taste
for
kisses
then
suddenly
with
an
anxious
cry
guthrie
darling
what
is
the
matter
with
you
nothing
he
said
hastily
nothing
of
course
except
that
we
must
be
serious
and
sensible
and
and
talk
things
over
quietly
dear
as
you
say
you
are
not
a
child
no
more
am
i
we
know
the
ropes
francie
do
we
we
outgrown
the
delusions
of
boys
and
girls
we
had
our
experiences
as
man
and
woman
eh
you
know
what
i
mean
no
need
to
mince
matters
to
go
in
for
conventional
nonsense
you
and
i
we
can
talk
straight
to
each
other
at
a
time
like
this
as
he
laboured
painfully
to
explain
without
explaining
her
face
faded
like
a
sunny
landscape
when
a
wet
fog
crawls
over
it
for
francie
though
it
was
she
loved
him
she
loved
him
all
she
knew
guthrie
she
moaned
piteously
have
you
left
off
caring
for
me
no
francie
of
course
i
have
have
you
while
i
have
been
away
and
in
so
much
trouble
been
putting
another
woman
in
my
place
certainly
not
is
it
that
you
do
like
to
live
on
his
money
guthrie
i
should
not
like
to
live
on
it
decidedly
not
but
the
fact
is
i
have
given
the
money
a
thought
then
why
why
are
you
like
this
i
tell
you
francie
i
tell
you
plainly
it
seems
infernally
brutal
but
i
sure
you
know
i
would
say
a
thing
to
hurt
you
if
i
could
help
it
oh
go
on
there
were
red
roses
in
her
cheeks
now
and
a
sparkle
that
was
not
all
firelight
in
her
eyes
it
is
this
dear
do
try
to
take
your
hands
away
i
am
going
to
keep
them
i
must
have
you
listen
to
me
till
i
quite
done
it
is
this
francie
love
as
we
very
well
know
i
mean
our
sort
of
love
is
one
thing
and
marriage
another
what
oh
is
that
it
ah
ah
i
see
now
take
your
own
case
said
he
with
a
relentless
air
have
you
proved
it
up
to
the
hilt
proved
what
that
marriage
is
a
failure
of
course
marriage
is
a
failure
when
it
is
blundered
into
as
i
blundered
into
mine
when
i
was
too
young
and
ignorant
to
know
a
thing
about
it
that
is
not
saying
it
would
be
a
failure
now
it
would
be
a
dead
failure
francie
i
am
absolutely
convinced
of
it
because
you
have
grown
tired
of
me
because
somebody
else
has
got
hold
of
you
behind
my
back
because
oh
because
you
men
are
all
alike
thinking
of
nothing
but
the
amusement
of
the
hour
sucking
a
as
if
she
were
an
orange
and
throwing
her
aside
like
the
useless
skin
without
honour
without
constancy
selfish
heartless
treacherous
hush
francie
do
talk
rubbish
i
may
be
like
other
men
i
no
doubt
i
am
but
i
not
all
that
when
i
make
an
engagement
i
keep
it
when
i
take
obligations
and
responsibilities
upon
me
i
do
my
best
to
fulfil
them
most
men
do
decent
men
but
they
never
have
justice
done
them
in
these
cases
in
these
cases
she
echoed
scornfully
everybody
knows
what
their
conduct
is
in
these
cases
the
world
is
well
used
to
it
oh
i
ought
to
have
known
if
i
had
been
the
most
incredible
fool
it
was
not
for
want
of
warnings
but
you
seemed
so
different
the
idea
that
you
could
play
with
a
woman
in
this
way
compromise
her
change
all
her
life
and
spoil
it
utterly
and
then
back
out
oh
oh
can
you
sit
there
and
tell
me
that
you
have
incurred
no
responsibility
in
your
dealings
with
me
guthrie
making
me
love
you
as
i
did
making
me
a
bad
woman
unfaithful
to
my
good
husband
the
most
honourable
the
most
trustful
of
men
did
i
do
that
honour
bright
now
francie
oh
this
is
too
much
she
burst
out
furiously
springing
from
her
seat
and
being
dragged
back
by
his
iron
grasp
of
her
hands
let
me
go
sir
i
have
had
insults
enough
and
in
my
own
house
with
no
husband
to
protect
me
sit
down
he
commanded
and
for
god
sake
do
do
go
on
like
that
i
ca
stand
it
i
am
not
insulting
you
dear
not
wilfully
insulting
you
not
more
than
i
am
forced
to
i
only
want
us
both
to
understand
the
case
as
it
is
surely
you
and
i
are
not
afraid
to
speak
out
to
face
the
truth
you
are
not
crying
francie
no
no
indeed
i
not
do
you
flatter
yourself
i
am
not
hurt
and
i
not
the
sort
of
person
to
go
begging
a
man
to
marry
me
either
i
do
think
i
really
do
think
that
i
am
quite
so
poorly
off
as
all
that
comes
to
here
she
laughed
but
only
for
an
instant
if
you
were
to
go
down
on
your
knees
before
me
guthrie
i
would
not
have
you
now
after
the
things
you
have
said
to
me
the
statement
calmed
and
strengthened
him
he
felt
able
to
say
the
rest
quite
right
francie
dozens
of
men
will
come
courting
you
as
soon
as
you
go
out
again
and
any
one
of
them
will
make
you
a
better
husband
than
i
should
have
done
but
not
a
better
friend
i
hope
you
will
always
remember
that
many
thanks
will
you
be
so
very
kind
as
to
release
my
hands
captain
carey
they
ache
one
moment
i
want
to
make
sure
of
the
last
chance
i
shall
get
to
explain
to
tell
you
exactly
what
i
mean
you
who
are
old
enough
experienced
enough
to
understand
i
do
want
to
defend
myself
francie
not
at
all
i
am
not
the
cad
to
say
woman
tempted
me
and
i
did
eat
i
do
blame
you
dear
i
do
blame
anybody
a
woman
is
a
woman
and
a
lovely
woman
like
you
well
the
way
things
are
managed
in
this
world
i
do
believe
she
can
help
herself
but
look
here
francie
a
man
is
a
man
too
and
a
good
deal
more
so
if
you
were
a
girl
i
would
say
this
but
you
knew
you
knew
what
you
were
doing
when
you
laid
yourself
out
to
be
sweet
and
and
kind
to
a
fellow
as
you
were
to
me
did
you
take
me
for
an
old
maid
or
a
social
purity
society
you
know
you
did
a
man
does
his
best
but
he
too
heavily
handicapped
i
wo
say
by
nature
perhaps
by
habit
which
is
second
nature
the
habit
of
generations
inherited
in
his
blood
and
his
case
is
not
on
with
your
case
and
especially
when
he
is
a
sailor
so
cut
off
so
deprived
very
well
and
so
it
happened
as
it
happened
never
mind
about
the
right
and
wrong
what
wrong
today
may
be
right
tomorrow
and
in
any
case
no
arguing
can
undo
what
done
we
leave
that
she
sat
before
him
panting
and
the
roses
in
her
cheeks
were
white
happily
the
fire
had
grown
a
little
dull
by
this
time
for
myself
he
continued
speaking
slowly
as
if
trying
to
think
things
out
for
myself
whether
i
ought
to
repent
or
not
i
do
i
ca
theoretically
i
know
it
is
always
the
man
who
is
in
the
wrong
and
i
should
have
been
foully
in
the
wrong
i
should
be
unfit
to
live
if
you
had
been
an
unmarried
girl
francie
or
if
i
had
been
the
the
oh
she
moaned
bitterly
grasping
his
point
of
view
if
not
the
plain
justice
of
it
but
i
have
brought
it
on
myself
i
have
only
myself
to
thank
i
made
myself
cheap
and
must
take
the
consequences
it
is
not
that
he
said
kindly
but
still
feeling
in
his
unsophisticated
brain
that
it
was
i
do
hold
you
cheap
my
dear
i
want
to
disabuse
your
mind
of
that
idea
that
i
am
throwing
anything
in
your
teeth
good
god
i
should
think
not
it
would
come
ill
from
me
i
have
no
conventional
views
about
these
things
none
but
look
here
now
if
you
were
my
wife
i
should
never
see
you
with
another
fellow
without
thinking
well
you
know
what
i
should
think
and
feeling
myself
like
poor
old
ewing
oh
i
am
a
brute
it
was
revealed
to
him
all
at
once
do
do
forgive
me
pray
do
apologise
she
cried
in
a
high
shaking
voice
it
is
best
as
you
say
to
speak
plainly
not
to
mince
matters
especially
as
there
is
no
one
to
call
you
to
account
for
what
you
say
and
it
would
be
worse
for
you
ever
so
much
he
continued
earnestly
having
got
into
the
way
of
of
this
sort
of
thing
i
afraid
i
might
be
tempted
again
that
i
could
honestly
promise
in
short
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
we
are
neither
of
us
domesticated
so
to
speak
there
that
will
do
she
broke
in
coldly
furious
but
with
a
volcano
in
her
breast
that
threatened
eruption
and
devastation
shortly
will
you
let
me
go
captain
carey
or
must
i
call
my
servants
to
my
assistance
i
have
only
servants
now
yes
yes
and
he
released
one
hand
i
will
if
you
say
you
forgive
me
francie
i
made
an
awful
mess
of
it
i
know
they
rose
together
and
the
other
hand
was
freed
it
was
the
right
hand
and
she
returned
it
to
him
immediately
she
said
between
clenched
teeth
he
held
her
tightly
once
more
may
i
come
and
see
you
again
may
i
write
i
can
say
it
better
in
writing
you
have
said
all
that
needs
to
be
said
there
is
no
necessity
to
write
if
you
write
to
me
i
shall
return
the
letter
unopened
but
why
it
is
surely
absurd
for
us
to
put
on
airs
of
dignity
with
one
another
francie
you
do
mean
us
to
part
like
this
she
stepped
quickly
across
the
hearthrug
and
with
a
passionate
gesture
pressed
the
button
of
the
bell
evidently
to
summon
willis
to
show
him
out
so
he
took
up
his
hat
offended
in
his
turn
and
for
the
first
time
feeling
fairly
easy
in
his
mind
as
to
the
way
he
was
treating
her
but
the
tragedy
of
the
moment
was
turned
to
vulgar
comedy
by
her
alarm
at
the
fact
that
she
had
struck
the
bell
before
relighting
the
pink
lamps
oh
where
are
the
matches
she
whispered
excitedly
i
ca
find
them
here
here
he
cried
fumbling
for
his
own
pocket
box
and
their
flurried
hands
got
mixed
as
she
turned
the
taps
while
he
applied
the
light
to
the
burners
the
instant
after
they
had
restored
the
room
to
its
normal
condition
the
butler
appeared
mrs
ewing
turned
to
him
with
the
amazing
of
a
woman
accustomed
to
extricate
herself
at
a
moment
notice
from
an
awkward
fix
willis
she
said
sweetly
and
even
smiled
as
she
spoke
will
you
please
have
a
cab
fetched
for
captain
carey
he
is
rather
late
for
a
dinner
engagement
the
butler
acknowledged
the
order
and
withdrew
in
the
light
of
the
pink
lamps
the
late
combatants
looked
strangely
at
one
another
and
you
would
have
married
mary
the
woman
commented
upon
the
issue
of
the
fight
it
was
both
a
taunt
and
an
accusation
the
man
lifted
his
brows
questioningly
as
at
a
loss
to
comprehend
her
meaning
has
that
anything
to
do
with
it
he
asked
do
see
the
connection
the
sentences
were
short
but
signified
many
things
chapter
xxiv
frances
ewing
was
a
shady
name
thereafter
to
those
in
the
know
pennycuick
blood
and
pride
notwithstanding
she
seemed
to
lose
her
own
sustaining
when
she
lost
the
respect
of
the
man
she
loved
when
he
showed
her
with
such
barbarous
and
uncompromising
candour
the
essential
difference
between
a
mistress
and
a
wife
of
course
she
got
over
that
grievous
affair
which
for
a
time
broke
whatever
heart
she
had
to
break
her
freedom
and
her
money
her
youth
and
her
beauty
were
still
hers
and
she
made
the
most
of
them
and
that
most
was
a
great
deal
in
her
cosmopolitan
sets
she
was
a
popular
and
distinguished
figure
from
one
fashionably
rowdy
continental
resort
to
another
she
carried
her
rich
jewels
and
trappings
and
her
personal
magnetism
and
sat
down
for
the
season
to
a
campaign
of
social
stratagem
and
sentimental
intrigue
to
the
indulgence
of
her
unbridled
appetite
for
excitement
and
the
admiration
of
men
and
ever
at
the
end
when
it
was
time
to
move
on
to
another
bijou
apartment
in
another
place
there
was
a
fresh
scalp
at
her
girdle
and
nothing
as
it
were
to
show
for
it
until
at
last
her
vanity
was
tempted
with
a
title
and
she
married
an
italian
count
who
if
all
tales
were
true
paid
the
debt
that
his
sex
owed
her
with
heavy
interest
but
those
tales
did
not
reach
the
ears
of
the
sisters
at
home
to
them
with
the
object
of
suitably
impressing
them
she
wrote
an
occasional
note
of
which
half
the
words
were
titles
of
nobility
and
the
humbler
relatives
accepted
the
fact
of
her
unapproachable
elevation
above
them
the
breens
made
easy
jokes
upon
the
subject
mr
goldsworthy
jealousy
of
her
was
overcome
by
his
pride
in
the
connection
we
had
a
letter
from
my
the
countess
the
other
day
he
would
amiably
remark
and
proceed
to
repeat
and
amplify
the
fashionable
intelligence
contained
therein
instead
of
taking
away
her
character
as
he
had
been
used
to
do
deborah
was
the
only
sister
with
whom
she
can
be
said
to
have
corresponded
and
deborah
had
a
shrewd
suspicion
that
all
was
not
gold
that
glittered
in
francie
lot
deborah
had
the
best
means
of
knowing
being
herself
a
and
what
is
called
a
society
woman
as
well
known
in
the
resorts
of
such
as
frances
herself
but
although
they
seemed
to
run
so
closely
and
so
much
upon
the
same
lines
there
was
as
wide
a
gap
of
social
difference
and
between
them
as
between
any
two
of
their
family
and
deb
was
not
one
to
think
evil
of
her
own
flesh
and
blood
if
it
was
possible
to
think
good
she
too
might
have
filled
her
letters
to
australia
with
titles
of
nobility
nobility
of
a
firmer
standing
than
the
countess
and
her
friends
could
boast
of
had
she
been
inclined
to
do
so
a
baronial
hall
dating
from
the
conquest
a
ducal
castle
not
to
speak
of
a
royal
presence
chamber
was
nothing
to
deborah
pennycuick
after
a
while
to
see
her
on
a
crowded
london
staircase
laughing
with
a
prince
or
a
prime
minister
was
a
common
object
of
the
season
for
a
number
of
years
while
varnishing
days
and
first
nights
would
have
lacked
charm
for
the
society
reporter
who
could
not
place
her
fine
figure
and
her
french
gowns
in
his
pictures
of
these
scenes
goodwood
and
cowes
were
familiar
with
her
striking
face
and
her
expert
interest
in
horses
and
yachts
highland
english
claimed
her
for
their
own
southern
europe
the
nile
bayreuth
in
short
wherever
social
life
was
bright
comfortable
and
select
there
she
turned
up
promiscuous
as
the
spirit
moved
her
to
be
welcomed
as
a
matter
of
course
men
young
and
old
continued
to
pay
her
homage
which
was
not
just
the
sort
of
homage
they
paid
to
frances
proposals
of
marriage
were
or
might
have
been
if
not
nipped
in
the
bud
almost
as
plentiful
as
invitations
to
country
houses
in
the
autumn
and
she
relished
it
all
with
singular
enjoyment
until
she
began
to
feel
the
approach
of
that
winter
and
evening
of
life
which
has
so
sharp
a
chill
for
those
who
have
loved
the
sun
claud
dalzell
was
likewise
a
denizen
of
the
great
world
that
was
hers
and
not
francie
and
close
corporation
as
it
is
they
were
never
far
off
each
other
beat
seldom
in
ignorance
of
each
other
whereabouts
at
the
same
time
they
also
did
not
touch
it
was
known
throughout
the
great
world
which
is
so
small
that
there
was
a
deadly
feud
between
them
and
tactful
hostesses
took
pains
not
to
bring
them
into
juxtaposition
in
public
places
when
meetings
occurred
by
accident
only
the
most
frigid
bows
were
interchanged
for
in
quite
early
times
when
the
australian
heiress
as
she
was
improperly
styled
was
taking
london
more
or
less
by
storm
she
chanced
to
overhear
a
brief
colloquy
not
intended
for
her
ears
who
is
that
glorious
woman
that
came
in
with
the
duchess
i
do
see
her
just
now
but
she
had
a
red
frock
on
with
black
lace
over
it
dark
hair
and
diamond
stars
not
half
as
bright
and
fine
as
her
eyes
by
jove
it
must
be
miss
pennycuick
an
australian
lady
she
is
with
the
duchess
party
oh
is
that
miss
pennycuick
well
now
i
can
believe
what
i
heard
of
her
being
so
charming
she
carries
it
in
her
face
she
was
charming
until
she
came
into
her
money
that
has
quite
spoilt
her
it
was
claud
dalzell
who
said
it
and
deb
heard
him
say
it
she
moved
off
out
of
the
press
that
had
brought
her
within
reach
of
his
cold
voice
not
to
be
mistaken
by
her
for
any
other
voice
and
she
vowed
through
clenched
teeth
that
never
again
would
she
come
within
that
distance
of
him
if
she
could
help
it
the
years
as
they
passed
only
strengthened
this
determination
each
proud
inclination
of
the
head
each
ceremonious
lift
of
the
hat
added
bitterness
to
their
mutual
resentment
to
his
feeling
that
she
was
spoiled
by
her
money
and
to
her
feeling
that
he
wilfully
misjudged
her
the
breach
was
widened
by
their
unconcealed
flirtations
a
description
mentally
applied
to
the
most
ordinary
acquaintanceships
on
either
side
but
not
inappropriate
in
all
cases
claud
ever
loved
the
company
of
handsome
women
who
appreciated
him
deb
naturally
inclined
to
nice
men
in
preference
to
the
nicest
women
and
each
liked
to
show
the
other
that
he
or
she
was
still
of
high
importance
to
somebody
rumours
of
impending
marriage
were
continually
being
wafted
to
his
ears
or
hers
but
nothing
came
of
them
he
was
confirmed
in
luxurious
bachelorhood
she
was
aware
of
many
and
could
not
bring
herself
to
value
any
of
her
disinterested
suitors
at
the
price
of
her
freedom
so
the
lovers
drifted
more
and
more
apart
until
somehow
they
lost
sight
of
each
other
altogether
and
meanwhile
the
years
made
them
old
without
their
knowing
it
she
was
unreasonably
upset
on
one
occasion
by
the
offer
of
a
specific
for
grey
hair
from
a
fashionable
london
it
was
absolutely
permanent
harmless
and
undetectable
he
said
but
i
am
not
grey
she
indignantly
informed
him
whereupon
she
saw
his
keen
professional
eye
wander
about
her
brow
as
he
murmured
something
about
the
faint
beginnings
that
might
as
well
be
checked
at
home
she
studied
the
matter
carefully
in
a
strong
light
and
called
rosalie
her
maid
to
aid
her
the
little
frenchwoman
assured
her
that
a
microscope
was
needed
to
detect
a
white
thread
in
that
beautiful
mass
of
dark
with
a
microscope
no
doubt
as
many
as
half
a
dozen
might
be
discerned
dimly
just
where
it
waved
back
from
mademoiselle
face
that
same
afternoon
she
and
rosalie
left
town
for
one
of
their
visits
it
was
a
weepy
autumn
day
and
she
was
not
as
fresh
as
usual
the
combined
with
some
troublesome
shopping
had
tired
her
and
the
disquieting
suspicion
laid
hold
of
her
that
she
was
more
easily
fatigued
than
she
used
to
be
while
reading
her
novel
in
the
train
she
counted
her
years
and
compared
herself
with
the
women
she
knew
whose
ages
were
recorded
in
the
peerage
and
who
could
therefore
be
proved
to
be
as
old
as
herself
some
of
them
were
wrinkled
hags
carelessness
or
doubtless
she
reflected
and
neither
charge
could
be
laid
at
her
door
that
horrid
man
it
was
dark
night
when
they
reached
the
little
station
belonging
to
the
mansion
that
was
their
goal
a
dozen
other
guests
and
their
servants
and
baggage
crowded
the
platform
and
carriages
and
the
yard
behind
and
deb
was
at
once
in
charge
of
a
tall
footman
rosalie
struggling
through
the
press
with
and
chattering
french
to
one
of
her
familiars
in
the
rear
distracted
stationmaster
and
porters
uncovered
to
the
stately
woman
as
she
passed
it
was
all
a
matter
of
course
to
her
these
days
she
was
too
late
for
the
big
the
men
had
gone
to
the
the
women
to
their
own
firesides
after
a
brief
but
affectionate
interview
with
her
titled
hostess
deb
was
soon
at
hers
slippered
and
sipping
the
jaded
woman
stimulant
warming
the
damp
and
dismalness
out
of
her
assuring
herself
confidently
that
she
was
not
an
old
woman
and
had
no
intention
of
becoming
one
certainly
when
rosalie
had
dressed
her
she
was
entitled
to
an
easy
mind
the
best
of
everything
tonight
in
vindication
of
her
still
unimpaired
beauty
and
potency
shimmering
brocade
of
her
favourite
red
and
lace
like
fairy
work
and
then
that
magnificent
breast
and
massive
throat
and
the
stately
head
crowned
with
the
famous
five
stars
whose
flashing
made
the
eye
wink
and
which
yet
were
dimmed
by
the
light
of
her
dark
eyes
she
surveyed
herself
with
full
content
when
the
last
touch
had
been
given
her
and
her
slow
sweep
corridors
and
grand
staircase
was
a
triumphal
march
she
knew
that
her
entrance
into
the
crowd
downstairs
could
no
more
fail
of
its
customary
effect
than
could
the
appearance
of
the
sun
next
morning
or
one
should
rather
say
the
announcement
of
dinner
to
the
tired
and
hungry
shooting
men
she
was
met
at
the
foot
of
the
grand
staircase
by
her
host
and
immediately
surrounded
in
the
close
press
of
friends
she
did
not
notice
the
strangers
time
was
too
short
and
they
were
too
many
a
lord
of
her
acquaintance
who
still
hoped
to
make
her
his
lady
took
her
into
dinner
and
called
upon
all
her
powers
of
wit
and
repartee
to
meet
his
conversational
tactics
during
the
meal
it
was
an
exhilarating
encounter
and
of
sufficient
interest
to
keep
her
eyes
in
the
boat
moreover
the
table
was
immense
and
the
chief
of
the
strangers
sitting
on
her
side
of
it
a
long
way
off
after
dinner
there
was
little
comedietta
played
on
the
boards
of
the
toy
theatre
belonging
to
the
house
many
of
the
ladies
were
in
their
places
before
the
men
still
craving
repose
after
their
hard
work
could
hoist
themselves
from
their
chairs
in
the
deb
having
helped
to
coach
one
of
the
amateur
performers
was
early
in
her
seat
in
front
some
of
her
admirers
did
manage
to
squeeze
in
beside
and
behind
her
from
time
to
time
but
the
particular
stranger
haughtily
held
aloof
then
when
the
play
was
over
there
was
an
impromptu
dance
for
the
theatre
was
an
annexe
to
the
it
was
the
young
folk
who
began
it
but
older
ladies
joined
in
and
all
the
men
but
the
hardened
sportsmen
who
saw
a
chance
to
sneak
to
their
snuggery
and
before
the
time
the
really
old
women
obviously
past
their
dancing
days
sat
around
and
looked
on
and
gossiped
to
one
another
and
for
a
time
deb
sat
with
them
she
was
certainly
tired
for
her
and
the
fact
struck
her
that
she
had
not
danced
for
a
long
time
she
had
shirked
balls
having
only
too
many
entertainments
to
choose
from
she
thought
it
likely
that
she
would
be
stiff
and
heavy
on
her
feet
from
want
of
practice
a
horrible
idea
to
her
who
had
once
danced
like
a
feather
in
the
wind
a
good
stone
had
been
added
to
her
weight
since
she
had
last
waltzed
with
satisfaction
to
herself
that
also
was
not
a
pleasing
thought
so
when
her
dinner
lord
essayed
to
entice
her
she
shook
her
head
a
dozen
other
men
and
the
cream
of
them
too
there
was
comfort
in
that
followed
his
example
and
made
her
charming
compliments
when
she
said
laughingly
that
she
was
too
old
for
these
frivolities
too
old
gracious
heavens
they
apostrophised
space
it
was
to
hear
them
but
they
went
off
easily
and
were
soon
dancing
with
the
young
girls
sylphs
as
airy
and
agile
as
she
had
once
been
and
by
degrees
she
drew
apart
from
the
old
ladies
and
their
talk
which
she
hated
to
seem
even
to
herself
to
belong
to
and
presently
found
herself
in
the
extraordinary
position
of
sitting
alone
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
with
eyes
half
shut
looked
at
the
whirling
couples
and
dreamed
of
the
days
the
dances
the
youth
that
were
no
more
she
saw
not
this
splendid
saloon
but
a
shabby
small
room
in
an
old
bush
house
the
walls
not
panelled
with
paintings
by
and
starred
with
clusters
of
electric
lights
but
with
wreaths
of
homely
evergreens
and
smelly
kerosene
lamps
and
amid
the
happy
throng
that
jostled
for
room
to
dance
there
a
girl
and
a
young
man
newly
betrothed
anticipating
an
immortal
paradise
in
each
other
arms
and
she
looked
up
and
saw
claud
dalzell
watching
her
he
was
horribly
aged
illness
it
seemed
and
had
grown
quite
white
that
splendid
lover
with
whom
she
had
danced
as
no
girl
here
knew
how
to
dance
in
the
golden
prime
of
everything
their
eyes
met
and
there
must
have
been
in
both
pairs
something
that
neither
of
them
had
seen
before
he
crossed
to
her
side
at
once
and
she
did
not
freeze
him
when
he
got
there
how
do
you
do
i
have
been
wondering
if
you
were
going
to
recognise
me
how
do
you
do
i
did
know
you
were
here
i
never
saw
you
until
this
moment
i
have
been
standing
there
for
ten
minutes
i
did
not
notice
i
was
thinking
you
were
deeply
i
was
trying
to
guess
what
you
were
thinking
of
i
wonder
did
you
i
wonder
was
it
by
any
chance
he
dropped
his
voice
five
creeks
she
was
quite
startled
and
discomposed
by
this
extraordinary
divination
having
no
time
to
decide
how
she
would
take
it
she
filled
the
embarrassed
moment
with
a
laugh
goodness
i
no
idea
that
my
face
was
such
a
i
believe
i
was
that
funny
old
room
with
ridges
in
the
floor
and
the
ceiling
nearly
on
your
head
how
did
we
manage
to
dance
in
it
well
we
did
manage
somehow
did
we
they
gazed
at
the
figures
wheeling
past
them
blankly
unresponsive
to
casual
stares
and
smiles
they
seemed
to
hear
the
rotten
shut
so
long
ago
creak
on
their
rusty
hinges
heard
anything
of
the
urquharts
lately
yes
alice
was
married
the
other
day
to
a
widower
with
fourteen
children
she
has
not
been
very
happy
at
home
i
fear
with
wife
harold
has
the
place
now
you
know
jim
gave
it
up
to
him
when
he
married
when
who
married
harold
what
jim
doing
he
is
my
manager
at
redford
mr
dalzell
smiled
darkly
he
likes
that
i
suppose
i
do
know
whether
he
likes
it
or
not
i
sure
but
i
do
i
know
that
everything
right
when
he
is
there
married
lawks
no
the
most
confirmed
old
bachelor
on
the
face
of
the
earth
they
fell
silent
again
still
gazing
into
the
room
deb
lay
back
and
fanned
herself
claud
leaned
forward
and
nursed
his
knee
he
ought
now
to
have
asked
news
of
her
sisters
but
he
avoided
mentioning
any
of
them
been
back
lately
deb
not
for
years
i
am
ashamed
to
say
anybody
living
at
redford
miss
keene
and
a
few
servants
only
too
bad
is
it
oh
i
must
go
soon
and
see
the
old
place
but
this
european
life
somehow
the
longer
you
live
it
the
less
you
feel
you
can
live
any
other
i
used
to
feel
that
but
now
one
gets
awfully
tired
of
things
oh
i
do
but
then
you
keep
so
horribly
young
do
you
know
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
she
flushed
up
like
a
girl
thank
you
that
a
very
pleasing
compliment
although
i
know
you
can
not
mean
it
i
like
not
to
mean
it
i
like
to
have
found
you
as
old
as
i
am
myself
how
cruel
of
you
not
that
you
are
such
a
methuselah
as
you
would
try
to
make
out
there
are
not
five
years
between
us
he
broke
in
sharply
i
know
back
went
memory
in
a
flash
to
a
succession
of
childish
birthdays
their
and
festive
celebrations
his
was
in
november
and
his
party
was
usually
a
picnic
hers
was
in
may
and
was
kept
in
the
house
with
big
fires
and
a
crowned
with
a
iced
cake
and
and
in
the
evening
she
recalled
wild
contests
with
an
imperious
little
boy
who
could
never
conquer
her
except
by
stooping
to
it
and
the
silliness
of
their
behaviour
to
each
other
when
they
grew
from
children
into
boy
and
girl
not
much
fun
in
birthdays
now
deb
he
seemed
to
comment
on
her
thoughts
oh
well
she
sighed
vaguely
and
at
that
instant
the
music
stopped
someone
gave
the
signal
to
retire
from
the
bedwards
they
were
parted
by
the
crowd
that
gathered
about
them
when
the
dancing
ceased
and
he
did
not
find
her
again
even
to
say
chapter
xxv
the
shooting
men
were
up
first
to
their
early
breakfast
it
seemed
to
deb
a
matter
of
course
that
claud
would
be
of
this
virile
company
it
was
his
saving
grace
as
a
man
when
he
was
young
that
he
was
a
keen
and
accomplished
sportsman
after
an
indifferent
night
she
rose
lazily
and
late
found
as
she
expected
only
a
few
more
women
in
the
and
ate
her
own
meal
alone
at
one
of
the
little
tables
the
hostess
drifted
in
amongst
the
last
and
stopped
a
moment
to
shake
hands
and
exchange
a
word
it
seems
a
beautiful
day
she
said
and
we
shall
be
making
up
a
party
to
go
out
and
lunch
with
the
guns
you
will
join
us
of
course
but
deb
thought
of
claud
amongst
the
guns
and
of
the
horrible
risk
of
appearing
to
run
after
him
and
she
replied
sweetly
that
although
she
would
have
loved
the
outing
she
was
afraid
she
must
stay
at
home
owing
to
important
letters
that
had
to
be
written
for
the
afternoon
post
all
right
said
the
hostess
i
stay
too
there
are
plenty
without
me
and
we
have
a
drive
later
on
she
passed
to
her
and
deb
rose
and
went
upstairs
to
see
what
she
could
find
to
attend
to
in
the
way
of
pressing
correspondence
she
had
the
status
of
a
married
lady
in
this
great
house
as
everywhere
that
is
to
say
a
of
her
own
a
very
cosy
place
between
tea
and
the
just
now
however
rosalie
was
busy
in
it
the
maid
offered
to
retire
to
the
adjoining
but
deb
said
oh
never
mind
go
on
and
gathering
her
and
papers
went
downstairs
again
to
make
herself
comfortable
in
the
library
she
loved
a
good
library
to
sit
in
and
generally
found
privacy
therein
at
this
time
of
day
the
library
here
was
magnificent
in
stately
comfort
books
in
thousands
busts
old
masters
muffling
turkey
carpets
a
great
bright
still
fire
and
armchairs
so
big
and
soft
that
it
was
strange
they
could
stand
empty
she
drew
up
one
of
them
and
sat
awhile
toasting
her
feet
and
turning
precious
leaves
it
was
the
interval
covered
by
claud
breakfast
and
then
set
herself
to
the
business
she
was
supposed
to
be
engaged
in
dear
francie
i
tried
at
shops
to
match
your
chinese
satin
but
nowhere
could
i
get
the
exact
shade
if
you
like
i
will
try
again
when
i
go
back
to
town
but
if
i
were
you
i
would
not
attempt
to
make
it
go
with
any
modern
stuff
which
could
not
help
looking
crude
beside
it
i
would
have
quite
another
material
and
colour
what
do
you
stay
to
she
paused
reflectively
the
tip
of
her
between
her
teeth
her
eyes
fixed
absently
upon
the
green
park
beyond
the
open
window
composing
a
gorgeous
costume
in
her
mind
before
she
could
even
decide
whether
to
advise
a
with
crepe
de
chine
or
a
with
oriental
cashmere
one
of
the
noiseless
library
doors
swung
back
and
a
man
came
in
without
noticing
her
still
figure
he
strolled
over
to
a
certain
shelf
opened
a
book
that
he
wanted
and
stood
with
his
back
to
her
turning
over
the
leaves
so
he
had
not
gone
with
the
men
how
horrid
and
what
a
nuisance
that
he
should
find
her
here
well
she
was
not
going
to
put
herself
out
for
him
she
lowered
her
pen
softly
and
began
to
scratch
the
paper
over
which
she
bent
absorbedly
he
turned
round
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
oh
it
you
claud
good
morning
why
i
thought
you
would
be
out
with
the
guns
this
fine
day
fine
day
do
you
call
it
there
a
wind
like
a
knife
and
you
sit
here
with
the
window
wide
open
he
marched
towards
it
and
shut
it
with
violence
it
was
a
great
glass
door
between
stone
mullions
above
it
and
two
of
glittering
transparency
three
coats
of
many
quarterings
enriched
the
of
the
stately
room
she
watched
him
with
the
beginning
of
a
smile
upon
her
lips
the
humour
of
the
situation
appealed
to
her
i
like
an
open
window
she
remarked
mildly
if
you
remember
i
always
did
he
came
towards
her
looking
at
her
gloomily
looking
himself
thin
and
grey
and
shivery
but
always
like
a
prince
you
have
more
flesh
to
keep
you
warm
than
i
have
said
he
quite
roughly
thank
you
she
bridled
and
flushed
her
massive
figure
for
a
woman
of
her
years
was
perfect
but
of
course
she
was
as
sensitive
as
the
female
always
is
to
the
suspicion
that
she
was
too
fat
you
have
not
lost
the
art
of
paying
graceful
compliments
i
meant
it
for
one
said
he
replying
to
her
scoffing
tone
you
put
me
to
shame
deb
with
your
vigour
and
youthfulness
i
know
how
old
you
are
and
you
do
look
it
by
ten
years
and
you
are
a
beauty
still
let
me
tell
you
it
may
not
be
a
graceful
compliment
but
at
least
it
is
sincere
even
these
girls
here
nonsense
about
beauty
at
my
time
of
life
she
broke
in
but
she
smiled
behind
her
frown
and
forgave
him
his
remark
about
her
flesh
you
and
i
are
too
old
to
talk
that
sort
of
stuff
now
do
you
think
i
am
so
very
old
he
asked
her
standing
before
her
as
if
inviting
a
serious
judgment
she
glanced
quickly
over
him
his
moustache
was
white
his
face
scratched
with
fine
lines
about
the
eyes
he
stooped
at
the
shoulders
and
his
chest
had
hollowed
in
yet
she
could
have
returned
his
compliment
and
called
him
a
beauty
still
he
was
so
to
her
every
line
and
movement
of
his
body
had
a
distinction
all
his
own
and
what
a
shame
it
is
she
thought
for
that
profile
to
crumble
away
before
it
has
been
carved
in
marble
we
are
in
the
same
boat
she
answered
him
there
are
not
five
years
between
us
five
years
put
us
out
of
the
same
boat
he
rejoined
especially
when
they
are
virtually
fifteen
deb
i
know
you
think
me
an
old
man
you
what
i
think
is
that
you
are
a
sick
man
she
said
kindly
are
you
claud
you
used
to
be
so
strong
for
all
your
slenderness
what
is
the
matter
with
you
everything
nothing
only
that
i
feel
old
and
that
i
have
been
used
to
feeling
old
and
that
it
so
so
loathsome
i
sure
it
is
she
laughed
rallying
him
i
can
understand
your
being
sick
if
you
have
come
to
that
but
why
do
you
let
yourself
why
do
you
think
about
it
why
do
you
own
to
it
in
that
abject
way
i
never
do
i
determined
not
to
be
an
old
woman
until
i
am
obliged
and
i
do
paint
either
she
added
and
my
hair
is
my
own
he
seemed
to
study
her
cheek
and
her
hair
she
coloured
up
dipped
her
pen
and
looked
at
her
unfinished
letter
he
wandered
off
a
step
or
two
and
returned
do
you
know
this
thing
of
hamerton
he
inquired
in
a
casual
way
extending
the
volume
he
held
she
took
it
laying
down
her
pen
a
considerable
literary
discussion
ensued
during
which
he
fetched
more
books
from
the
shelves
to
show
her
it
began
to
appear
that
he
meant
to
spend
the
whole
morning
with
her
possibly
taking
it
for
granted
that
it
was
her
desire
to
have
him
that
idea
if
he
entertained
it
must
be
corrected
at
once
she
resumed
her
pen
with
a
air
deb
said
he
then
do
you
mind
if
i
read
here
for
a
little
while
i
wo
disturb
you
it
so
nice
and
quiet
away
from
those
chattering
women
oh
certainly
she
politely
acquiesced
but
do
you
think
want
you
with
all
the
other
men
away
now
your
opportunity
to
be
made
much
of
i
do
care
to
be
made
much
of
just
because
i
am
the
only
man
oh
but
you
would
always
be
more
than
that
of
course
i
not
more
than
an
old
fogey
when
the
young
fellows
are
around
they
will
take
no
notice
of
me
at
well
i
getting
used
to
it
i
getting
to
know
my
place
if
that
was
your
place
you
would
soon
vacate
it
how
can
i
vacate
it
when
people
begin
to
take
me
for
an
old
fogey
they
not
have
the
honour
of
my
company
in
their
houses
that
very
well
for
you
wait
till
the
time
comes
and
i
suppose
you
like
it
anyhow
you
seem
to
enjoy
all
this
waving
a
hand
around
as
if
you
were
a
girl
who
had
never
seen
anything
i
sick
and
tired
of
the
whole
show
then
do
have
any
more
to
do
with
it
go
home
home
what
home
have
i
a
lovely
flat
in
town
they
tell
me
where
you
give
the
best
dinners
and
ladies
theatre
parties
and
things
pshaw
i
am
hardly
ever
there
i
hate
the
racket
of
london
in
the
season
i
not
up
to
it
nowadays
and
you
would
have
me
stranded
in
piccadilly
at
this
time
of
year
i
presume
i
obliged
to
spend
the
winter
down
south
and
by
the
same
token
i
must
soon
be
getting
off
or
these
east
winds
and
damp
mists
will
play
the
deuce
with
my
bronchitis
oh
it
bronchitis
is
it
i
knew
it
was
something
i
suppose
been
coddling
yourself
with
hot
rooms
and
all
sorts
of
flannel
things
that
the
way
people
make
themselves
tender
and
get
chills
and
chest
complaints
and
get
old
before
their
time
the
doctors
insist
on
flannel
the
natural
wool
all
of
them
the
greatest
mistake
in
the
world
i
used
to
wear
it
because
i
thought
the
doctors
ought
to
know
and
i
was
always
getting
colds
now
i
never
let
a
bit
of
wool
touch
my
skin
have
for
years
and
years
and
never
know
what
it
means
to
have
a
cold
that
is
contrary
to
all
the
traditions
he
remarked
seriously
addressing
her
handsome
back
for
she
was
still
supposed
to
be
writing
her
letter
i
ca
believe
that
it
is
due
to
not
wearing
flannel
debbie
it
your
splendid
vitality
your
being
so
different
from
other
people
nothing
of
the
sort
you
try
it
not
just
now
of
course
with
winter
beginning
but
when
warm
weather
comes
again
and
so
on
the
hostess
broke
in
upon
their
while
they
were
still
engrossed
in
this
interesting
topic
she
was
drawn
into
it
and
made
a
disciple
of
by
deb
who
attributed
all
her
own
blooming
health
and
practical
youthfulness
to
linen
underclothing
combined
with
plenty
of
fresh
air
and
after
all
since
was
hopeless
she
did
go
out
to
lunch
with
the
guns
claud
remained
alone
and
disconsolate
by
the
library
fire
she
was
due
to
leave
the
house
next
day
and
left
although
conscious
of
a
strange
hankering
to
stay
and
during
the
interval
gave
mr
dalzell
no
further
opportunity
to
talk
about
his
bronchitis
and
other
things
he
was
not
aware
that
she
was
to
go
so
soon
until
she
was
gone
and
then
he
found
himself
with
livelier
feelings
than
had
stirred
his
languid
being
for
many
a
day
he
was
not
only
annoyed
and
disappointed
at
being
deprived
of
the
refreshment
of
her
stimulating
society
he
was
incensed
with
her
mode
of
departure
which
seemed
to
imply
an
intention
to
evade
him
does
she
still
think
that
i
am
after
her
money
he
asked
himself
with
scorn
of
her
mean
suspiciousness
just
because
i
was
magnanimous
enough
to
ignore
the
past
he
went
down
south
to
play
a
little
at
monte
carlo
and
cruise
a
little
in
the
mediterranean
to
kill
time
through
the
detestable
winter
which
made
itself
felt
wherever
he
was
and
she
went
to
london
to
see
about
francie
gown
and
up
north
to
bracing
scotland
and
down
to
wellwood
for
christmas
and
back
to
the
racket
of
london
in
the
spring
and
neither
of
them
had
spent
a
lonelier
time
in
all
their
lives
quite
a
fresh
and
peculiar
sense
of
homelessness
and
uncomforted
old
age
took
possession
of
them
both
all
through
the
kaleidoscopic
of
the
season
through
which
she
moved
magnificently
notwithstanding
she
was
unconsciously
seeking
him
it
was
her
impression
from
all
she
had
heard
of
his
tastes
and
ways
that
he
could
not
keep
away
from
that
common
rendezvous
of
his
class
and
kind
she
did
not
find
him
but
all
the
same
he
was
there
he
returned
from
his
winter
haunts
sooner
than
his
wont
while
still
the
april
winds
were
full
of
menace
for
him
exposed
himself
to
those
winds
seeking
her
caught
a
chill
neglected
it
a
most
unusual
thing
and
fell
into
an
illness
that
confined
him
to
his
bed
for
many
weeks
it
was
not
until
june
that
deb
heard
of
it
he
was
truly
so
much
of
an
old
fogey
now
in
the
society
of
which
he
had
once
been
such
a
distinguished
ornament
that
his
disappearance
was
long
unnoticed
and
when
at
last
someone
noticed
it
in
deb
hearing
the
light
and
callous
way
in
which
his
trouble
was
referred
to
went
to
her
heart
knowing
all
she
knew
one
of
her
generous
impulses
came
to
her
on
the
spot
and
an
hour
later
she
was
at
the
door
of
his
chambers
inquiring
after
him
his
man
a
very
jewel
of
a
man
received
her
at
the
door
gravely
cautiously
keeping
it
half
shut
he
reported
his
master
mending
but
still
weak
and
not
able
to
see
anyone
females
of
all
kinds
were
sternly
discouraged
by
this
prudent
person
from
force
of
old
habit
oh
of
course
not
said
deb
just
give
him
my
card
please
and
say
i
very
glad
to
hear
he
is
not
as
ill
as
i
feared
on
pain
of
dismissal
from
the
best
service
he
had
ever
known
and
he
had
known
it
now
for
a
long
time
manton
had
to
find
the
address
as
soon
as
it
was
supplied
to
him
claud
sent
for
her
to
come
and
see
him
are
we
not
old
enough
now
to
dispense
with
chaperons
he
wrote
and
the
sight
of
his
after
all
these
long
years
moved
her
strangely
if
you
think
not
bring
the
deafest
old
post
of
your
acquaintance
only
do
come
i
have
had
anybody
to
speak
to
for
a
week
of
course
we
are
old
enough
commented
deb
as
she
read
the
words
the
idea
of
fussing
about
chaperons
and
that
nonsense
at
our
time
of
life
and
she
proceeded
to
array
herself
in
her
most
youthful
summer
dress
which
was
also
the
choicest
of
her
stock
taking
the
utmost
pains
to
match
toque
and
gloves
while
full
of
indignation
against
his
friends
for
so
shamefully
neglecting
him
boldly
she
ascended
to
his
in
the
wake
of
manton
who
presently
brought
tea
and
at
intervals
tended
the
fire
apparently
without
once
casting
an
eye
upon
her
claud
was
up
and
dressed
in
her
honour
while
fit
only
for
his
bed
in
the
midst
of
the
refined
luxury
that
he
had
gathered
about
him
he
looked
but
the
ghost
of
a
man
worn
with
his
illness
and
the
fatigue
of
preparing
for
her
it
was
one
of
those
english
summers
that
never
answered
to
its
name
and
he
sat
in
a
overcoat
considered
more
respectful
than
a
in
a
heat
that
almost
choked
her
but
with
swelling
heart
she
hurried
to
his
side
and
after
greetings
drew
a
chair
close
up
to
his
took
the
hand
he
silently
extended
and
held
it
in
a
long
warm
maternal
clasp
manton
retired
and
shut
the
door
the
invalid
lay
back
on
his
cushions
and
closed
his
eyes
the
visitor
watching
him
detected
an
oozing
tear
the
first
she
had
ever
seen
there
how
did
it
happen
she
crooned
and
followed
the
question
with
many
more
of
the
same
sort
to
which
he
replied
as
to
a
mother
or
a
nurse
it
this
beastly
climate
he
complained
it
upsets
me
every
time
though
this
is
the
worst
bout
i
had
yet
i
really
ca
stand
it
debbie
even
in
june
when
you
think
you
were
safe
just
look
at
it
it
was
raining
slightly
as
he
spoke
well
why
do
you
try
to
stand
it
said
she
why
not
come
back
to
your
own
country
you
be
safe
there
if
anywhere
i
been
thinking
of
it
said
he
it
has
been
in
my
mind
all
winter
the
thought
of
that
good
soaking
sunshine
that
we
used
to
have
and
think
nothing
of
the
riviera
is
a
patch
on
it
aye
i
get
warm
there
but
what
a
life
now
i
am
not
like
you
i
got
nothing
and
nobody
to
go
back
to
i
should
be
giving
up
everything
the
little
that
i
have
left
and
god
knows
life
is
empty
enough
as
it
is
well
i
going
she
broke
in
and
am
i
nobody
he
sprang
up
in
his
chair
you
you
going
time
i
did
she
laughed
i
have
set
eyes
on
my
property
and
my
two
sisters
since
goodness
knows
when
he
held
out
his
shaking
hands
his
face
was
working
pitifully
debbie
debbie
he
wailed
like
a
lost
child
will
you
take
me
will
you
have
me
she
caught
him
in
her
strong
arms
dearest
we
will
go
together
she
murmured
and
he
fell
sobbing
on
her
breast
it
was
not
in
the
least
what
she
had
meant
to
say
or
to
do
but
the
appeal
was
irresistible
it
was
too
terrible
to
see
him
him
her
young
prince
of
such
towering
pride
and
beauty
brought
down
to
this
but
she
soon
had
him
out
of
his
slough
of
despond
and
climbing
the
hills
of
hope
again
with
something
of
his
old
gallant
air
the
rapidity
of
his
convalescence
was
astonishing
by
the
end
of
july
he
was
well
enough
to
be
married
chapter
xxvi
the
first
letter
signed
deborah
dalzell
was
addressed
strange
to
say
to
guthrie
carey
not
to
the
commander
of
the
ss
aphrodite
via
his
shipping
office
but
to
guthrie
carey
wellwood
hall
norfolk
for
a
great
change
had
taken
place
in
the
circumstances
of
her
old
friend
one
day
a
few
years
earlier
he
had
been
called
from
the
sea
somewhere
off
the
coast
of
south
america
to
take
his
place
as
a
and
amongst
the
great
squires
of
england
quite
the
very
last
thing
he
could
have
anticipated
in
his
wildest
dreams
three
sons
of
the
reigning
carey
had
been
capsized
in
a
gale
while
out
yachting
the
reigning
carey
on
hearing
of
the
catastrophe
had
been
seized
with
a
fit
that
proved
fatal
in
a
few
hours
his
eldest
wife
as
an
effect
of
the
same
shock
had
given
birth
to
a
male
infant
the
sole
grandson
one
brother
had
died
childless
another
leaving
daughters
only
the
third
guthrie
father
was
also
dead
thus
the
unexpected
happened
as
it
has
a
way
of
doing
in
this
world
and
the
mate
of
old
redford
days
had
become
the
head
of
a
county
family
his
experiences
had
trained
him
for
the
change
he
took
it
soberly
without
losing
his
head
a
bristling
array
of
were
gradually
transformed
into
a
circle
of
respectful
friends
some
of
them
assisted
him
to
settle
himself
in
his
unfamiliar
seat
to
teach
him
the
duties
of
his
high
station
he
was
teachable
but
independent
not
shutting
his
eyes
and
opening
his
mouth
to
swallow
all
the
creeds
they
chose
to
put
into
it
but
studying
every
branch
of
the
science
of
landlordism
in
the
light
of
his
own
intelligence
and
beliefs
when
he
had
fairly
mastered
the
situation
he
married
one
of
his
cousins
he
was
in
his
robust
which
comes
so
much
later
to
men
than
to
women
she
was
well
on
in
her
thirties
a
comely
sensible
young
lady
and
a
most
excellent
coadjutor
to
a
squire
new
to
the
business
an
eminently
wise
selection
said
his
brother
squires
when
the
engagement
was
announced
the
wedding
was
a
great
family
function
and
county
event
it
meant
that
the
careys
instead
of
being
split
up
and
scattered
to
the
winds
remained
together
united
in
amity
it
meant
that
the
dignity
of
the
old
house
was
to
be
kept
up
when
a
year
later
wellwood
rang
bells
and
lit
bonfires
in
honour
of
a
son
and
heir
nothing
seemed
wanting
to
confirm
the
general
impression
that
our
guthrie
was
not
only
a
wise
but
a
singularly
fortunate
man
it
was
an
impression
that
guthrie
shared
from
the
point
of
view
that
he
had
now
reached
in
life
he
believed
himself
favoured
beyond
the
common
lot
he
loved
wellwood
full
of
the
memorials
of
his
ancient
race
he
enjoyed
his
settled
and
comfortable
place
therein
after
the
homeless
roving
of
so
many
years
the
feel
of
solid
land
under
his
feet
and
under
his
life
for
which
every
sailor
pines
despite
whatever
spell
the
sea
may
lay
on
him
he
was
proud
of
his
wife
who
was
also
his
good
friend
and
confidante
he
was
egregiously
proud
of
his
handsome
boy
and
the
day
of
the
young
romance
of
the
great
passion
of
those
sordid
little
fires
which
beckon
to
men
whose
nature
craves
for
warmth
and
whose
yule
is
cold
that
day
was
past
love
is
one
thing
and
marriage
another
he
had
once
said
without
really
meaning
it
but
he
had
spoken
truer
than
he
knew
moreover
the
shocking
statement
was
not
nearly
so
awful
as
it
seemed
the
very
conditions
of
married
life
are
fatal
to
love
as
love
is
understood
by
the
yet
unmarried
lovers
insanely
sanguine
of
human
necessity
asking
the
impossible
and
no
blame
to
them
because
they
are
made
so
but
no
matter
that
thing
which
comes
afterwards
to
the
and
and
which
they
do
think
worth
calling
love
that
sober
faithful
forbearing
friendship
that
mutual
need
which
endures
all
the
time
and
is
ever
more
deeply
satisfied
and
satisfying
instead
of
less
is
no
bad
substitute
yet
how
the
world
of
imagination
dominates
the
world
of
fact
how
much
fairer
the
unseen
than
the
seen
how
much
more
precious
the
good
we
have
not
than
the
good
we
have
in
his
private
desk
in
his
private
study
guthrie
kept
just
as
old
mr
pennycuick
had
kept
his
valentine
a
faded
spotted
photograph
of
poor
little
lily
in
the
saucer
bonnet
with
lace
brides
to
it
that
she
was
married
in
and
when
wellwood
was
humming
with
shooting
parties
and
the
like
and
its
lady
doing
the
honours
of
the
house
with
all
the
forethought
and
devotion
that
she
could
bring
to
the
task
the
stout
squire
would
be
sitting
in
his
sanctum
under
lock
and
key
gazing
at
that
sweet
which
had
the
luck
to
be
dead
and
gone
lily
in
the
retrospect
was
the
faultless
woman
the
ideal
wife
and
love
young
dream
in
one
i
have
had
my
day
was
the
thought
of
his
heart
as
he
looked
across
the
gulf
of
strenuous
chequered
disappointing
years
to
that
idyll
of
the
far
past
which
her
pictured
form
brought
back
to
him
whatever
is
lacking
now
i
have
known
the
fullness
of
love
and
bliss
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
perfect
union
between
man
and
woman
rare
as
it
may
be
it
will
be
remembered
that
he
was
married
to
her
actually
for
a
period
not
exceeding
five
weeks
in
all
and
deborah
pennycuick
who
would
have
made
such
a
magnificent
lady
of
wellwood
who
was
in
fact
asked
to
take
the
post
before
it
was
offered
to
the
cousin
she
came
to
spend
christmas
under
his
roof
while
still
a
spinster
on
the
tacit
understanding
that
neither
was
a
subject
for
nonsense
any
more
deb
and
mrs
carey
were
close
friends
deb
was
the
godmother
of
the
heir
the
homelikeness
of
wellwood
was
intensified
by
her
intercourse
while
there
with
english
redford
and
the
descendants
of
that
brother
with
whom
old
mr
pennycuick
had
been
unable
to
hit
it
off
humdrum
persons
whose
attraction
for
her
lay
in
their
name
and
blood
and
the
fact
that
they
could
show
her
the
arms
and
portraits
of
her
ancestors
and
the
wainscotted
room
in
which
her
father
was
born
it
was
to
wellwood
that
she
went
to
be
married
from
the
old
home
of
the
careys
she
was
driven
to
the
old
church
of
the
pennycuicks
full
of
mouldering
monuments
to
a
nearly
vanished
race
it
was
buried
in
its
rural
solitude
far
from
railways
and
and
newspaper
reporters
and
the
wedding
was
as
quiet
as
quiet
could
be
guthrie
was
acting
brother
and
gave
her
away
he
never
of
course
disclosed
the
secret
that
was
his
and
francie
honest
brother
as
he
longed
to
be
but
perhaps
even
had
she
known
it
and
her
own
austere
chastity
notwithstanding
she
might
have
been
enough
to
judge
him
kindlier
than
is
the
wont
of
the
sex
which
does
not
know
all
and
have
still
held
him
worthy
to
be
to
her
the
friend
he
was
as
she
knew
him
she
loved
him
and
turned
to
him
naturally
when
she
needed
a
brother
services
and
so
it
was
to
him
that
she
wrote
first
at
the
end
of
the
short
journey
just
to
tell
him
that
she
and
her
bridegroom
had
arrived
safely
and
that
claud
was
standing
the
fatigue
much
better
than
they
could
have
hoped
she
did
not
write
to
frances
until
she
had
her
husband
on
the
high
seas
she
did
not
write
at
all
to
mary
or
rose
not
wishing
them
to
know
of
her
marriage
until
she
could
personally
it
to
them
it
was
not
difficult
to
ensure
this
since
for
many
a
year
they
had
all
been
so
separated
by
their
respective
circumstances
that
they
were
no
longer
sisters
in
the
old
redford
sense
the
business
of
each
was
her
own
and
not
supposed
to
interest
the
rest
only
such
domestic
events
as
were
of
serious
moment
were
formally
reported
amongst
them
and
were
never
deemed
serious
enough
to
use
the
cable
for
the
pair
came
home
very
quietly
sydney
was
the
port
of
arrival
and
here
deb
divined
on
the
part
of
her
husband
a
desire
to
be
left
in
peace
to
recruit
after
laborious
travelling
in
the
care
of
his
devoted
and
accomplished
man
while
she
went
forward
to
get
the
fuss
over
those
sisters
were
the
shadows
upon
his
now
sunny
path
although
he
did
not
say
so
he
wanted
to
get
to
redford
without
having
to
kiss
them
and
talk
to
their
offensive
on
the
way
so
deb
proposed
to
do
what
she
felt
he
wished
and
paid
no
heed
to
the
dutiful
objections
which
he
could
not
make
to
sound
genuine
in
her
ears
she
telegraphed
instructions
to
bob
goldsworthy
to
engage
rooms
for
her
and
to
meet
her
signing
the
message
aunt
deborah
her
only
herald
bob
was
duly
at
spencer
street
elegant
in
curled
moustaches
and
a
become
a
swell
young
barrister
since
she
had
seen
him
last
he
was
sure
of
the
impression
he
would
create
upon
his
discriminating
aunt
and
had
no
notion
that
her
first
flashing
glance
at
him
was
accompanied
by
a
flashing
thought
of
how
her
adopted
son
would
too
surely
be
ranked
by
her
more
discriminating
husband
with
the
bounders
of
his
implacable
disdain
on
the
platform
while
explaining
that
he
knew
it
was
not
the
proper
thing
to
do
in
a
public
place
he
embraced
the
majestic
figure
in
the
splendid
sable
cloak
deb
said
bother
the
proper
thing
and
kissed
him
readily
charily
however
because
conscious
of
teeth
that
were
not
pennycuick
teeth
and
perversely
objecting
to
the
faultless
costume
but
looking
at
the
she
perceived
upon
the
sleeve
another
encircled
his
glittering
tall
hat
not
oh
bob
not
your
mother
she
gasped
he
shook
his
head
and
asked
a
question
about
her
luggage
aunt
rose
your
uncle
oh
aunt
deb
do
she
is
my
aunt
i
know
but
he
bob
spread
deprecating
hands
they
are
both
well
i
believe
i
think
i
heard
that
the
fiftieth
baby
arrived
last
week
is
that
your
maid
in
the
brown
oh
but
bob
tell
me
they
have
lost
any
of
those
nice
children
i
do
trust
i
should
hardly
have
been
in
mourning
on
their
account
no
fat
and
tough
as
little
pigs
by
the
look
of
them
it
is
my
father
aunt
deb
i
thought
you
knew
what
she
stopped
on
their
way
towards
rosalie
and
the
luggage
van
you
do
say
yes
a
couple
of
months
ago
the
mater
wrote
to
you
i
have
been
wandering
from
place
to
place
the
letter
never
reached
me
pneumonia
supervening
upon
influenza
that
is
what
the
doctors
called
it
but
it
was
really
a
complication
of
disorders
some
of
them
of
long
standing
between
you
and
me
aunt
deb
he
took
a
great
deal
more
than
was
good
for
him
latterly
and
that
told
upon
him
his
blood
was
bad
you
know
he
was
always
a
man
deb
nodded
forgetting
that
it
was
a
son
who
spoke
she
was
saying
to
herself
bennet
goldsworthy
whom
we
made
sure
would
live
for
ever
bennet
goldsworthy
of
all
people
what
a
relief
that
will
be
to
claud
and
then
she
thought
of
her
widowed
sister
with
a
rush
of
pity
and
compunction
he
was
her
husband
after
all
bob
light
attention
to
the
subject
was
already
gone
he
was
staring
at
one
of
the
great
trunks
covered
with
foreign
labels
rosalie
was
telling
him
how
many
more
mrs
dalzell
had
oh
yes
said
deb
confused
and
crimson
i
forgot
to
mention
i
suppose
you
do
know
that
i
am
married
to
an
old
friend
of
our
family
your
mother
will
know
him
well
by
the
way
bob
i
must
go
and
see
her
at
once
we
have
some
lunch
first
i
must
wash
and
change
my
clothes
then
will
you
stay
at
the
hotel
and
settle
rosalie
and
see
to
things
no
i
would
rather
go
alone
stay
in
town
and
dine
with
me
and
do
look
so
shocked
my
good
boy
as
if
i
cut
you
off
with
a
shilling
my
marriage
will
make
no
difference
to
you
aunt
deb
with
dignified
reproach
as
if
i
thought
of
that
but
somehow
she
felt
sure
he
did
think
of
it
they
had
luncheon
together
at
the
hotel
and
sat
awhile
to
digest
it
and
to
talk
things
over
while
they
sipped
coffee
he
told
her
how
he
had
furnished
his
bachelor
rooms
the
artistic
woodwork
the
curios
the
colours
how
he
had
hunted
for
the
right
shade
of
red
what
he
had
given
for
a
particular
rug
which
alone
would
blend
and
harmonise
she
was
brightly
interested
in
these
things
and
promised
to
go
and
see
them
she
was
to
go
to
lunch
next
day
he
thought
he
could
safely
undertake
not
to
poison
her
with
bad
cooking
or
unsound
wine
he
lived
in
chambers
in
parliament
place
this
engagement
booked
she
asked
him
for
his
mother
address
mary
lived
in
a
small
street
in
richmond
such
a
slum
said
bob
disgustedly
but
she
would
do
it
in
spite
of
all
that
i
could
say
and
rushed
there
too
when
he
had
hardly
been
dead
a
week
it
was
not
decent
as
i
told
her
to
be
advertising
the
sale
two
days
after
the
funeral
but
she
is
a
peculiar
woman
she
is
a
pennycuick
said
mrs
dalzell
reprovingly
she
would
not
care
to
go
on
living
in
a
house
that
she
had
ceased
to
have
the
right
to
live
in
i
should
not
myself
but
she
might
have
gone
to
another
place
you
must
insist
on
her
going
to
another
i
am
afraid
my
influence
is
not
enough
to
persuade
her
my
dear
boy
i
am
convinced
that
if
you
asked
her
to
walk
into
a
burning
fiery
furnace
she
would
do
it
to
please
you
without
a
moment
hesitation
she
is
that
way
in
some
things
poor
dear
but
in
others
i
may
talk
till
i
have
no
voice
left
and
she
wo
listen
and
she
was
set
on
this
scheme
she
has
a
mania
for
for
that
sort
of
thing
one
would
never
believe
that
she
was
your
sister
she
would
hate
to
live
like
other
people
she
simply
loves
to
be
a
nobody
i
ca
understand
it
you
try
your
influence
with
her
will
you
well
order
a
carriage
for
me
and
i
will
put
on
my
things
he
pressed
her
to
allow
him
to
escort
her
which
was
obviously
the
proper
thing
when
she
refused
again
and
went
off
like
any
nobody
alone
he
returned
to
his
chambers
leaving
rosalie
to
the
unimportant
persons
whose
business
it
was
to
look
after
her
mrs
breen
house
was
in
east
melbourne
and
deb
directed
the
coachman
to
drive
there
first
she
remembered
the
fiftieth
baby
that
was
but
a
few
days
old
i
must
see
how
the
poor
child
is
doing
deb
said
not
alluding
to
the
baby
and
soon
she
saw
again
the
garden
large
for
that
locality
and
the
spacious
white
house
almost
glittering
in
the
sun
she
had
sniffed
at
the
bourgeois
villa
she
thought
it
bourgeois
still
but
who
could
help
admiring
those
windowpanes
like
diamonds
and
that
grass
like
velvet
and
that
air
of
perfect
which
pervaded
every
inch
of
the
place
as
the
carriage
entered
the
fine
gates
a
flock
of
little
breens
attached
to
a
perambulator
two
nurses
and
five
dogs
were
coming
out
of
it
and
she
stopped
to
accost
and
kiss
them
each
child
was
as
fresh
as
a
daisy
its
hair
like
floss
silk
with
careful
brushing
its
petticoats
as
dainty
as
its
frock
its
socks
and
boots
immaculate
there
was
nannie
her
godchild
shot
up
slim
and
tall
from
the
dumpling
baby
that
her
aunt
remembered
showing
plainly
the
wholesome
woman
that
she
was
presently
to
become
deb
gazed
at
her
with
aches
of
regret
she
had
thought
them
for
ever
stifled
in
claud
companionship
for
her
own
lost
motherhood
and
of
lesser
but
still
poignant
regret
that
she
had
not
been
allowed
to
adopt
nannie
in
bob
goldsworthy
place
the
joy
of
dressing
and
taking
out
a
daughter
of
that
stamp
of
having
her
at
home
with
one
to
make
the
tea
and
to
chat
with
and
to
lean
on
old
keziah
came
to
the
door
keziah
sleek
and
placid
like
the
family
she
served
delighted
to
welcome
the
distinguished
traveller
but
still
more
delighted
to
brag
about
the
last
breen
baby
a
lovely
boy
without
spot
or
blemish
said
keziah
three
times
over
and
that
makes
eleven
and
not
one
too
many
and
miss

doing
fine
thank
you
i
go
and
prepare
her
for
the
surprise
so
it
do
upset
her
constance
quite
a
grown
young
lady
met
her
aunt
on
the
stairs
kathleen
and
lucy
rose
from
the
piano
in
the
where
they
had
been
entertaining
their
mother
at
a
safe
distance
with
their
pieces
they
too
had
to
be
greeted
and
kissed
and
sweeter
flesh
to
kiss
no
lips
could
ask
for
my
husband

be
a
draper
rose

with
a
handsomer
family
mentally
deb
compared
the
cool
cheeks
of
her
breen
nieces
with
her
goldsworthy
nephew
mouth
covering
those
unpleasant
teeth
it
would
have
been
fairer
to
compare
him
with
her
breen
nephews
but
there
the
contrast
would
have
been
nearly
as
great
john
at
business
with
his
father
and
pennycuick
learning
station
management
with
the
simpsons
at
bundaboo
had
the
fresh
and
cleanly
appearance
of
all
rose
children
in
physical
matters
they
were
as
clean
as
they
looked
bob
did
not
look
unclean
but
with
all
his
excessive
smartness
he
looked
unfresh
that
look
and
the
thing
it
meant
were
his
legacy
to
him
at
last
deb
reached
her
sister
room
it
was
another
addition
to
the
house
and
marked
like
each
former
one
the
prosperity
of
the
shop
supporting
it
the
fastidious
travelled
eye
appraised
the
rich
rugs
and
hangings
the
massive
suite
the
bed
and
took
in
the
general
air
of
warm
luxury
and
unstinted
comfort
even
before
it
fell
upon
rose
herself
rose
fat
and
fair
and
the
picture
of
content
sitting
in
the
softest
of
and
the
smartest
of
gowns
and
slippers
by
the
brightest
of
wood
fires
with
a
tableful
of
new
novels
and
magazines
on
one
side
of
her
and
a
frilly
cradle
on
the
other
my
husband
may
be
a
draper
she
had
remarked
at
various
times
but
he
does
give
me
a
good
home
deb
so
long
homeless
amid
her
wealth
conceded
at
this
moment
without
a
grudge
that
rose
humble
little
arrow
of
ambition
had
fairly
hit
the
mark
they
embraced
with
all
the
warmth
of
the
old
redford
days
a
few
hasty
questions
and
answers
were
exchanged
and
their
heads
met
over
the
cradle
you
poor
child
deb
exclaimed
as
a
matter
of
form
have
you
done
with
this
kind
of
thing
yet
oh
said
rose
i
should
feel
lost
without
one
now
and
we
wanted
another
boy
we
have
only
three
you
know
is
he
a
darling
number
eleven
fast
asleep
was
fished
from
his
downy
bed
and
laid
in
his
aunt
arms
eagerly
extended
for
him
his
clothes
might
have
been
woven
by
fairies
and
he
smelt
like
a
violet
bed
in
spring
strange
thrills
sharper
than
those
that
nannie
had
set
going
shook
deb
big
heart
as
she
cuddled
and
kissed
him
the
older
i
get
she
confessed
the
greater
fool
i
am
about
a
baby
and
you
do
have
such
nice
babies
rose
yes
simpered
rose
they
are
nicer
than
most
certainly
i
sure
i
do
know
why
her
eyes
gloated
on
the
white
bundle
she
fidgeted
to
get
it
back
ah
debbie
i
wish
i
wish
you
knew
i
know
you
do
my
dear
laughed
deb
a
little
queerly
and
she
returned
the
baby
in
order
to
hunt
for
her
handkerchief
and
if
you
must
know
the
truth
so
do
i
it
tantalising
to
see
you
with
more
than
your
share
while
i
have
none
and
never
shall
have
worse
luck
well
blowing
her
nose
cheerfully
it
no
use
crying
over
spilt
milk
is
it
and
i
tipped
the
can
over
myself
so
i
ca
complain
how
peter
rose
told
her
how
peter
was
so
dear
so
good
and
then
had
so
much
to
say
about
the
children
one
by
one
through
all
the
eleven
of
them
that
it
was
quite
in
a
hurry
at
last
that
deb
disclosed
her
secret
and
rose
not
only
sustained
no
shock
which
would
have
been
bad
for
her
but
could
see
nothing
in
the
marriage
worth
fussing
about
except
the
fact
that
it
came
too
late
for
a
family
such
a
sordidly
domestic
person
was
she
she
mourned
and
condoled
over
this
spilt
milk
so
sure
that
poor
deb
was
but
hungrily
lapping
up
drops
with
the
dust
of
the
floor
that
deb
grew
almost
angry
she
took
back
her
own
words
and
said
she
was
glad
there
were
no
children
to
come
between
her
and
her
husband
who
needed
only
each
other
she
implied
that
this
union
had
a
higher
significance
than
could
be
grasped
by
a
mere
suckler
of
fools
nice
fools
no
doubt
and
chronicler
of
small
beer
however
good
the
brew
she
believed
it
too
love
great
solemn
immortal
love
passionate
and
suffering
was
a
thing
unknown
to
comfortable
commonplace
rose
as
doubtless
to
peter
also
they
were
dear
good
people
and
fortunate
in
their
ignorance
and
in
what
it
spared
them
but
it
was
annoying
when
ignorance
assumed
superior
knowledge
and
wanted
to
teach
its
grandmother
to
suck
eggs
was
it
come
to
this
that
marriage
and
a
family
were
synonymous
terms
no
indeed
nor
ever
would
while
intelligent
men
and
women
walked
the
earth
deb
reserved
the
more
sacred
confidences
for
mary
ear
mary
had
loved
strangely
indeed
but
tragically
with
pain
and
loss
the
dignified
concomitants
of
the
divine
state
mary
would
understand
chapter
xxvii
mary
house
was
a
chill
and
meagre
contrast
to
that
of
rose
but
there
was
nothing
cold
in
mary
welcome
to
deb
darling
and
smothering
embrace
of
furs
the
slim
woman
responded
with
a
grip
and
pressure
that
represented
all
her
strength
deb
although
not
the
eldest
was
the
mother
of
the
family
as
well
as
the
second
mother
of
bob
where
is
he
were
mary
first
words
and
deb
smiled
inwardly
to
see
her
as
absurd
in
her
mother
vanity
and
preoccupation
as
rose
herself
but
this
was
a
case
of
a
widow
only
son
and
the
visitor
was
thankful
for
such
a
beginning
to
the
interview
where
is
he
cried
the
anxious
voice
he
was
to
have
met
you
and
he
never
fails
this
is
not
like
him
oh
deb
struck
in
easily
he
was
there
all
right
looking
after
his
old
aunt
like
a
good
boy
he
wanted
to
bring
me
but
i
told
him
he
could
be
more
useful
looking
after
rosalie
and
my
things
i
thought
we
rather
be
by
ourselves
molly
poor
old
girl
you
know
i
never
heard
a
word
until
he
told
me
just
now
your
letter
did
not
reach
me
they
kissed
again
in
the
passage
of
the
little
house
you
will
send
away
the
carriage
debbie
mary
urged
without
visible
emotion
there
are
stables
in
the
next
street
you
will
take
off
your
hat
and
stay
with
me
a
little
indeed
i
will
dearest
if
you
will
have
me
are
you
alone
quite
alone
where
the
old
lady
oh
dead
dead
long
ago
and
ruby
mary
looked
confused
ruby
ruby
is
do
you
know
an
actress
in
london
doing
very
well
they
tell
me
miss
pearla
gold
in
the
profession
gracious
why
i
seen
her
burlesque
tights
the
minx
well
she
must
be
coining
money
anyhow
i
hope
she
does
forget
to
make
some
return
for
all
the
trouble
she
has
been
to
you
she
forgets
everything
said
the
and
we
are
thankful
for
it
bob
hates
the
thought
it
is
hard
on
him
who
is
so
different
do
allude
to
it
before
him
please
he
feels
it
too
keenly
debbie
what
did
you
think
of
my
boy
oh
splendid
was
the
cordial
response
i
could
hardly
believe
my
eyes
is
he
not
the
fond
mother
urged
and
it
is
not
only
his
appearance
debbie
they
say
he
is
the
cleverest
lawyer
in
melbourne
he
is
so
learned
so
acute
he
has
a
practice
already
that
many
a
barrister
well
known
and
of
twice
his
age
might
envy
the
pale
woman
for
her
bricky
colour
had
faded
out
thrilled
and
glowed
yes
he
told
me
said
deb
and
it
was
good
hearing
indeed
but
i
always
knew
what
he
had
in
him
to
herself
she
said
if
he
is
so
well
off
does
he
let
her
live
like
this
poverty
though
decent
poverty
proclaimed
itself
in
every
detail
of
the
mean
which
stood
in
the
most
depressing
street
imaginable
it
made
the
wealthy
sister
heart
ache
and
how
are
you
yourself
debbie
mary
remembered
to
ask
as
she
shut
the
door
upon
the
departing
carriage
you
look
well
how
is
francie
we
want
you
to
tell
us
all
about
her
grand
doings
bob
is
greatly
interested
in
his
italian
aunt
he
thinks
he
would
like
to
take
a
vacation
trip
to
see
her
some
day
by
the
way
did
he
tell
you
that
rose
has
another
is
she
a
perfect
little
rabbit
and
quite
delighted
keziah
says
as
she
talked
in
this
detachment
from
her
personal
affairs
she
led
the
way
up
bare
stairs
to
her
small
bedroom
the
resplendent
woman
behind
her
took
note
of
the
widow
excessive
thinness
the
greyness
of
her
straight
tight
hair
the
rigid
lines
of
a
black
stuff
gown
that
had
not
a
scrap
of
trimming
on
it
not
even
the
lawn
widows
use
and
thought
of
bennet
goldsworthy
annoyance
when
his
wife
was
proved
to
have
fallen
behind
the
mode
and
as
she
expatiated
upon
the
charms
of
rose
eleventh
baby
deb
bright
dark
eyes
roved
about
mary
room
in
which
she
recognised
a
few
of
the
plainer
furnishings
of
the
nuptial
chamber
of
the
past
but
not
a
trace
of
the
person
who
had
been
so
much
amongst
them
once
his
boots
on
the
floor
his
clothes
on
the
his
razors
and
brushes
on
the
were
gone
so
were
a
basin
and
ewer
from
the
double
so
was
the
wide
bed
in
place
of
the
latter
a
small
one
originally
bob
had
been
set
up
at
the
head
of
which
lay
one
large
pillow
fairly
glistening
with
the
shine
of
its
fresh
although
darned
linen
sheath
carpet
and
curtains
essential
to
the
departed
housefather
had
disappeared
the
bare
windows
stood
open
to
what
fresh
air
there
was
the
floor
polished
and
with
one
rug
at
the
bedside
exhaled
the
sweet
perfume
of
beeswax
and
turpentine
it
was
all
so
pathetic
to
the
visitor
so
eloquent
of
loss
and
change
that
she
exclaimed
catching
her
sister
in
her
arms
oh
you
poor
thing
you
poor
poor
thing
mrs
goldsworthy
returned
the
embrace
tenderly
but
not
the
emotional
impulse
you
are
so
dear
and
kind
she
said
in
a
gentle
but
quite
steady
voice
i
am
so
glad
you
came
so
thankful
to
have
you
but
we
talk
about
that
if
you
do
mind
i
think
it
is
best
not
to
dwell
on
troubles
if
you
can
help
it
tell
me
about
yourself
i
suppose
you
have
had
lunch
well
then
we
will
have
a
nice
cup
of
tea
take
off
that
heavy
cloak
what
lovely
fur
and
your
hat
too
what
a
smart
affair
you
always
have
such
taste
no
i
am
not
wearing
crape
it
is
such
rough
uncomfortable
stuff
and
so
perishable
and
the
rule
is
not
hard
and
fast
nowadays
as
it
used
to
be
it
would
be
stupid
to
make
it
so
in
a
climate
like
this
do
you
want
a
comb
dear
how
brown
your
hair
keeps
still
then
let
us
go
downstairs
to
the
fire
the
fire
was
in
a
little
bare
parlour
as
austerely
appointed
as
the
bedroom
a
was
drawn
up
to
the
hearth
the
kettle
placed
on
the
coals
there
seemed
no
servant
on
the
premises
but
the
neatness
upstairs
was
repeated
below
everything
was
speckless
polished
smelling
of
its
own
purity
well
it
was
a
good
thing
poor
molly
could
interest
herself
in
these
matters
and
her
resolve
not
to
brood
over
her
troubles
if
it
was
genuine
and
not
only
a
heroic
pose
both
noble
and
wise
so
deb
reflected
and
such
was
the
calmness
of
the
emotional
atmosphere
the
cheering
effect
of
tea
and
rest
and
sisterly
companionship
the
discursiveness
of
the
talk
that
she
soon
found
herself
telling
mary
the
secret
that
she
was
so
sure
the
widow
would
hear
with
special
sympathy
and
understanding
it
is
awfully
selfish
she
began
to
bother
you
with
my
affairs
at
such
a
time
as
this
but
you
got
to
know
it
some
time
the
fact
is
some
folks
would
say
there
no
fool
like
an
old
fool
and
perhaps
you
agree
with
them
but
no
i
do
think
you
will
not
you
for
you
know
the
fact
is
do
laugh
but
i
sure
nobody
can
help
it
i
have
been
and
gone
and
got
married
molly
there
and
after
all
it
seemed
that
she
had
not
come
to
the
right
place
for
sympathy
and
understanding
mary
did
not
laugh
but
she
stared
in
a
wooden
manner
that
was
even
more
hurtful
to
the
feelings
of
the
new
wife
well
she
cried
brusquely
after
a
painful
pause
is
there
any
just
cause
or
impediment
that
you
know
of
you
look
as
if
you
thought
i
had
no
business
to
be
happy
like
other
people
oh
if
you
are
happy
but
i
am
so
surprised
who
is
it
guess
said
deb
i
could
not
i
have
an
idea
some
englishman
of
course
deb
shook
her
head
european
then
some
prince
or
count
as
big
as
francie
or
bigger
deb
wrinkled
a
disdainful
nose
it
is
no
use
moll
you
would
not
come
near
it
in
fifty
tries
tell
you
claud
dalzell
what
the
deadly
enemy
this
time
mrs
goldsworthy
did
laugh
deb
joined
in
funny
is
it
i
feel
sarcastically
like
going
into
fits
myself
when
i
think
of
it
it
is
so
screamingly
absurd
and
how
it
happened
i
ca
tell
you
unless
it
is
that
we
are
fallen
into
our
dotage
i
suppose
it
must
be
that
you
in
your
dotage
mary
mocked
with
an
affectionate
sincerity
that
was
grateful
to
her
sister
ear
you
are
the
youngest
of
us
all
and
always
will
be
do
you
ever
look
at
yourself
in
the
glass
upright
as
a
dart
and
your
pretty
wavy
hair
so
thick
and
scarcely
a
grey
thread
in
it
of
course
i
do
know
how
it
may
be
with
him
i
have
not
seen
him
for
such
ages
oh
he
is
a
perfect
badger
for
greyness
not
that
i
ever
saw
a
badger
by
the
way
and
he
walks
with
a
stick
and
has
dreadful
chronic
things
the
matter
with
him
from
eating
and
drinking
too
much
all
his
life
and
never
taking
enough
exercise
quite
the
old
man
i
should
have
called
him
a
few
months
ago
but
he
is
better
now
mrs
goldsworthy
gave
a
little
shudder
and
her
unsympathetic
gravity
returned
i
see
she
sighed
your
benevolent
heart
has
run
away
with
you
as
usual
his
infirmities
appealed
to
your
pity
you
married
him
so
that
you
might
nurse
and
take
care
of
him
not
at
all
deb
broke
in
warmly
and
do
you
talk
about
his
infirmities
in
that
way
he
is
no
more
infirm
than
you
are
did
i
say
he
was
that
was
my
joke
he
always
was
the
handsomest
man
that
i
ever
set
eyes
on
and
he
is
the
same
still
no
my
dear
i
have
not
married
him
to
take
care
of
him
but
so
that
he
may
take
care
of
me
i
lonely
i
want
somebody
i
come
to
the
time
of
life
when
i
am
of
no
account
to
the
young
folks
not
even
to
bob
who
would
not
give
me
a
second
thought
if
i
was
a
poor
woman
no
molly
dear
it
is
no
use
your
pretending
you
know
it
as
well
as
i
do
and
quite
natural
too
it
is
the
same
with
all
of
them
nothing
but
money
gives
me
importance
in
their
eyes
and
what
money
it
wo
keep
you
warm
in
the
winter
of
your
days
nothing
will
except
a
companion
that
is
in
the
same
boat
that
is
what
i
want
it
may
be
silly
but
i
do
somebody
to
go
down
into
the
valley
of
the
shadow
with
me
and
he
feels
the
same
something
in
mary
face
as
she
stared
into
the
fire
something
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
conversation
drove
her
into
this
line
of
there
is
no
and
young
nonsense
in
our
case
we
are
not
quite
such
idiots
as
that
comes
to
it
is
just
that
we
begin
to
feel
the
cold
as
it
were
and
are
going
to
camp
together
to
keep
each
other
warm
that
all
mary
remained
silent
well
i
must
go
said
deb
jumping
up
as
if
washing
her
hands
of
a
disappointing
job
the
carriage
must
be
there
and
bob
will
be
starving
for
his
dinner
no
use
asking
you
to
join
us
i
know
but
you
must
come
to
redford
soon
molly
or
somewhere
out
of
this
when
you
feel
better
and
able
you
shall
have
rooms
entirely
to
yourself
and
need
see
anybody
i
will
come
tomorrow
and
you
must
let
me
talk
to
you
about
it
mrs
goldsworthy
was
stooping
to
sweep
a
sprinkle
of
ashes
out
of
the
fender
she
was
like
an
old
maid
in
her
faddy
tidiness
and
when
she
turned
her
face
was
working
as
if
to
repress
tears
deb
caught
her
up
a
moan
bursting
from
her
lips
oh
what
a
brute
i
am
when
you
poor
poor
old
girl
have
to
finish
it
alone
but
darling
after
all
you
have
had
the
good
years
a
child
of
your
own
a
home
we
shall
get
only
the
dregs
at
the
bottom
of
the
cup
so
it
is
not
so
very
unfair
is
it
then
mary
pent
emotion
issued
in
a
laugh
with
her
face
on
her
sister
shoulder
she
tried
herself
to
silence
it
i
ca
help
it
she
apologised
i
would
if
i
could
debbie
go
oh
my
dear
do
think
i
envy
you
do
go
yet
i
want
to
tell
you
something
i
may
never
have
another
chance
of
course
i
go
i
want
to
stay
said
deb
at
once
and
she
stayed
the
coachman
was
dismissed
to
get
his
meal
and
instructed
to
telephone
to
bob
to
do
the
same
the
sisters
had
a
little
picnic
dinner
by
themselves
washing
up
their
plates
and
dishes
in
the
neat
kitchen
deb
insisting
upon
taking
part
in
the
performance
and
sat
long
by
the
fireside
afterwards
fortunately
although
the
season
was
late
spring
it
was
a
cold
day
for
the
clear
red
fire
was
the
one
bit
of
brightness
to
charm
a
visitor
to
that
poor
house
it
crackled
cosily
toasting
their
toes
outstretched
upon
the
melting
their
mood
to
such
glowing
confidences
as
they
had
not
exchanged
since
mary
was
in
her
teens
no
lamps
were
lighted
the
widow
was
frugal
with
gas
when
eyes
were
idle
her
extravagant
sister
loved
firelight
to
talk
in
but
for
a
while
it
seemed
that
mary
had
nothing
particular
to
communicate
deb
did
not
like
to
put
direct
questions
but
again
and
again
led
the
conversation
in
the
likely
direction
to
find
mary
avoiding
it
like
a
shying
horse
she
would
not
talk
of
her
husband
but
interested
herself
for
an
hour
in
the
subject
of
guthrie
carey
guthrie
wife
his
child
his
home
discussing
the
matter
with
a
calmness
that
made
deb
forget
how
delicate
a
one
it
was
then
mary
had
a
hundred
questions
to
ask
probably
on
bob
account
about
the
countess
of
whom
she
had
known
nothing
of
late
years
while
deb
had
learned
something
from
time
to
time
and
could
give
an
approximately
true
tale
quite
another
hour
was
taken
up
with
francie
wrongs
and
as
to
which
deb
was
more
frank
with
this
sister
than
she
would
have
been
with
rose
it
is
no
use
blinking
the
fact
she
said
straight
out
that
francie
is
no
better
than
she
should
be
i
ca
understand
it
no
pennycuick
that
ever
i
heard
of
took
that
line
before
she
has
a
dog
life
with
that
ruffian
no
doubt
and
of
course
the
poor
child
never
had
a
chance
to
enjoy
the
right
thing
in
the
right
way
though
that
was
her
own
fault
i
do
think
mary
broke
in
that
anything
is
anybody
fault
that
a
most
dangerous
heathen
doctrine
my
dear
but
i
admit
there
something
in
it
poor
francie
she
was
born
at
a
disadvantage
with
that
fascinating
face
of
hers
set
on
the
foundation
of
so
light
a
character
she
was
too
pretty
to
start
with
the
pretty
people
get
so
spoiled
so
filled
with
their
own
conceit
that
they
grow
up
expecting
a
world
made
on
purpose
for
them
they
grab
right
and
left
if
the
plums
do
fall
into
their
mouths
directly
they
open
them
because
it
gets
to
be
a
sort
of
matter
of
course
that
they
should
have
everything
and
do
exactly
as
they
like
and
the
plain
ones
they
are
born
at
a
worse
disadvantage
still
no
they
are
not
look
at
rose
francie
with
her
gilded
wretchedness
thinks
rosie
lot
quite
despicable
but
i
can
tell
you
molly
she
is
the
most
utterly
comfortable
and
contented
little
soul
on
the
face
of
this
earth
she
would
not
change
places
with
a
queen
but
rose
is
not
plain
rose
is
the
happy
medium
and
they
are
the
lucky
ones
the
inconspicuous
people
the
sort
what
luck
deb
vaguely
moralised
i
suppose
we
make
our
luck
it
does
depend
on
our
faces
but
on
ourselves
ah
no
mrs
goldsworthy
received
the
platitude
with
a
laugh
we
do
make
anything
we
are
made
it
is
just
a
dance
of
marionettes
debbie
poor
puppets
of
flesh
and
blood
treated
as
if
they
were
just
wood
and
nails
and
glue
who
set
us
up
to
make
a
game
of
us
like
this
who
does
pull
the
strings
debbie
it
is
a
mystery
to
me
then
deb
waited
for
what
was
coming
next
possibly
it
will
be
cleared
up
some
day
she
murmured
putting
out
her
strong
beautiful
hand
to
touch
her
sister
knee
whether
it
is
a
fairy
tale
or
not
one
must
cherish
the
hope
not
i
mary
cut
in
swiftly
that
same
mary
who
was
once
conspicuous
in
her
family
for
pious
orthodoxy
no
more
experiments
in
human
existence
for
me
a
few
years
of
peace
and
cleanness
as
i
am
as
i
now
am
i
hope
for
that
and
for
nothing
more
i
do
want
anything
more
i
rather
not
to
be
let
alone
for
the
rest
of
the
time
and
then
to
be
done
with
it
that
sums
up
all
the
hope
i
have
or
need
ah
my
dear
no
debbie
do
look
at
me
with
those
eyes
do
pity
me
in
that
tone
of
voice
i
am
only
a
heathen
against
my
will
not
so
as
not
to
care
what
happens
to
me
which
i
believe
is
what
you
think
i
am
not
even
sorry
i
wish
i
was
but
i
ca
be
in
fact
i
am
so
happy
really
that
i
am
going
about
in
a
sort
of
dream
trying
to
realise
it
happy
perhaps
is
not
the
word
i
should
say
unmiserable
i
am
more
unmiserable
than
i
have
ever
been
i
think
since
i
was
born
deb
swift
intelligence
grasped
the
truth
ah
then
she
was
not
so
insensate
as
we
thought
but
made
allowance
for
what
she
diagnosed
as
a
morbid
condition
of
mental
health
are
you
happier
than
you
were
at
redford
young
and
loved
and
with
everything
nice
about
you
yes
because
then
although
of
course
i
did
have
everything
i
had
no
idea
of
the
value
of
what
i
had
you
ca
be
really
happy
unless
you
know
that
you
are
happy
i
did
not
know
it
then
but
now
i
do
deb
glance
flashed
round
the
poor
room
and
out
of
the
window
into
the
squalid
street
she
thought
of
bob
who
almost
openly
despised
the
mother
who
adored
him
she
calculated
the
loneliness
the
poverty
the
to
her
ugliness
of
the
existence
which
mary
as
i
am
was
intended
to
describe
and
she
groaned
aloud
oh
my
dear
was
it
really
so
awful
as
that
that
the
mere
relief
from
it
can
mean
so
much
to
you
i
am
not
going
to
complain
said
mary
it
was
not
awful
by
fault
certainly
not
by
his
he
did
his
best
he
was
really
good
to
me
it
could
not
have
happened
at
all
except
through
his
being
good
to
me
doing
what
he
did
that
night
i
am
not
in
the
least
bitter
against
him
he
was
as
he
was
made
just
as
i
am
it
had
to
be
i
suppose
the
maker
of
the
puppets
did
care
whether
we
belonged
or
not
the
hand
that
pulled
the
strings
and
tangled
them
jerked
us
into
the
mire
together
anyhow
oh
do
pleaded
deb
do
blaspheme
like
that
what
is
religion
for
if
not
to
keep
us
from
making
blunders
and
to
help
us
to
bear
it
when
they
are
made
and
to
trust
to
trust
where
we
can
not
see
deb
was
unused
to
preaching
and
broke
down
but
her
eyes
were
sermons
more
impressive
than
any
of
the
thousands
that
mary
had
heard
some
day
said
mary
when
i
get
into
a
place
where
i
can
not
hear
religion
spoken
of
nor
see
it
practised
i
may
learn
the
value
of
it
i
hope
so
i
have
a
chance
of
it
now
the
way
is
clear
i
am
through
the
wood
at
last
deb
drew
her
filmy
handkerchief
across
her
eyes
yes
i
know
mary
smiled
at
her
sister
grief
but
it
is
only
for
this
once
debbie
dear
i
did
want
to
let
you
know
to
have
the
delight
of
not
being
a
liar
and
a
shuffler
for
once
i
shall
not
say
such
things
again
i
am
not
going
to
shock
anybody
else
for
bob
sake
bob
of
course
must
be
considered
after
all
it
was
his
father
none
of
us
even
the
freest
can
be
a
free
agent
altogether
i
understand
that
i
shall
hold
my
tongue
the
blessed
thing
is
that
that
will
be
sufficient
a
negative
attitude
with
the
mouth
shut
one
is
not
driven
any
longer
to
positive
deceit
without
even
being
able
to
say
that
you
ca
help
it
oh
debbie
you
have
been
a
free
woman
why
why
you
keep
so
but
with
all
your
freedom
and
all
your
money
you
know
the
meaning
of
such
luxury
as
i
live
in
now
deb
gazed
at
her
sister
rapt
face
glowing
in
the
firelight
and
wondered
if
the
brain
behind
it
could
be
altogether
sane
to
call
that
happiness
she
ejaculated
with
sad
irony
and
scorn
if
you
must
fix
a
name
to
it
yes
the
widow
considered
thoughtfully
after
all
does
not
go
far
enough
i
am
happy
for
debbie
turning
to
look
into
the
dark
troubled
eyes
i
clean
now
i
never
thought
to
be
again
to
know
anything
so
exquisitely
sweet
either
in
earth
or
heaven
i
clean
body
and
soul
day
and
night
inside
and
outside
at
last
oh
poor
girl
deb
moaned
with
tears
when
she
realised
what
this
meant
rich
corrected
mary
rich
dear
with
just
a
roof
and
a
crust
of
bread
well
said
deb
presently
what
about
that
roof
and
crust
of
bread
since
we
are
telling
each
other
everything
tell
me
what
your
resources
are
do
say
it
is
not
my
business
i
know
it
is
but
i
shall
be
wretched
if
you
do
let
me
make
it
mine
a
little
how
much
have
you
i
do
know
i
do
care
i
have
given
money
a
thought
it
does
matter
but
it
does
matter
you
ca
even
keep
clean
without
a
bathtub
and
a
bit
of
soap
but
what
am
i
thinking
of
of
course
you
will
settle
all
that
with
bob
the
little
word
of
three
letters
brought
mrs
goldsworthy
down
from
her
clouds
at
once
oh
no
she
cried
quickly
almost
fearfully
on
no
account
would
i
interfere
with
his
arrangements
his
career
he
would
do
everything
that
was
right
and
dutiful
i
am
sure
but
i
would
sooner
starve
than
take
charity
from
my
own
child
but
there
no
need
to
take
it
from
anybody
i
have
all
i
want
how
much
i
could
tell
you
to
a
pound
or
two
but
enough
for
my
small
wants
they
do
seem
small
indeed
where
are
you
going
to
live
wo
you
come
to
me
molly
redford
is
big
enough
and
it
morally
yours
as
much
as
mine
you
should
have
your
own
rooms
all
the
privacy
you
like
no
darling
thank
you
all
the
same
i
have
made
my
plans
i
am
going
to
have
a
little
cottage
somewhere
in
the
country
where
there
is
no
dust
or
smoke
or
people
where
i
can
walk
on
clean
earth
and
grass
and
smell
only
trees
and
rain
and
the
growing
things
alone
oh
yes
of
course
i
shall
see
you
sometimes
and
my
boy
but
for
a
home
all
the
home
i
can
want
or
wish
for
now
that
is
my
dream
i
do
think
said
deb
that
i
ever
heard
human
ambition
and
happiness
expressed
in
such
terms
before
it
was
the
final
result
of
mary
experiment
in
the
business
of
a
woman
life
deb
drove
back
to
her
hotel
thoughtful
and
sad
and
tired
when
rosalie
had
left
her
for
the
night
she
wrote
to
claud
by
way
of
comforting
herself
she
told
him
what
she
had
been
doing
described
her
interviews
with
rose
and
mary
respectively
and
the
impressions
they
had
left
on
her
of
all
the
four
of
us
she
concluded
her
letter
i
am
the
only
one
who
has
been
fortunate
in
love
i
found
my
mate
in
the
beginning
before
there
was
time
to
make
mistakes
the
right
man
whom
i
could
love
in
the
right
way
and
we
have
been
kept
for
each
other
through
all
these
years
although
for
a
long
time
we
did
not
know
it
and
now
we
are
together
or
shall
be
in
a
few
days
never
to
part
again
it
is
the
only
in
the
family
i
do
except
rose
because
i
call
that
a
which
has
had
a
happy
ending
chapter
xxviii
down
the
middle
of
the
big
in
two
rows
of
six
pens
each
with
an
aisle
between
them
the
bleating
sheep
were
massed
they
had
been
driven
into
that
aisle
and
thus
distributed
as
a
crowd
of
soldiers
might
be
packed
into
their
pews
at
church
and
twelve
little
gates
had
then
been
shut
upon
them
each
gate
had
a
corresponding
one
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
pen
opening
upon
a
broad
lane
of
floor
and
facing
a
doorway
into
outside
pens
and
the
sunny
paddocks
of
the
background
between
gate
and
door
on
his
own
section
of
the
boarded
lane
a
sweating
man
with
shears
performed
prodigies
of
strength
and
skill
every
few
minutes
he
snatched
a
heavy
sheep
from
the
pen
beside
him
flung
it
with
a
round
turn
into
a
sitting
posture
between
his
knees
and
with
the
calm
indifference
to
its
violent
objections
of
the
spider
to
those
of
the
fly
that
he
makes
into
a
parcel
sliced
off
its
coat
like
a
cook
peeling
a
potato
the
fleece
gently
fell
upon
the
floor
as
you
may
see
an
unnoticed
shawl
slip
from
an
old
lady
shoulders
and
before
it
could
realise
what
had
happened
the
poor
naked
animal
found
itself
shot
through
the
doorway
to
stagger
headlong
down
the
sloping
stage
that
was
its
returning
path
to
freedom
twelve
of
these
stalwart
and
strenuous
operators
lining
the
long
walls
at
regular
intervals
six
a
side
were
at
it
with
might
and
main
payment
by
results
being
the
rule
in
this
department
of
industry
and
attendant
boys
strolled
up
and
down
picking
the
fleeces
from
the
floor
and
carrying
them
to
the
sorter
table
one
was
the
whose
business
it
was
to
dab
a
brushful
of
tar
upon
any
scarlet
patch
appearing
upon
a
white
where
the
shears
had
clipped
too
close
the
sorter
or
classer
stood
behind
his
long
table
above
and
at
right
angles
to
the
lines
of
and
shearers
near
him
on
either
hand
were
racks
like
narrow
built
against
the
walls
behind
him
the
hydraulic
press
cranked
and
creaked
as
its
attendants
fed
and
manipulated
it
and
the
great
bales
that
others
were
sewing
up
weighing
and
branding
were
mounting
high
in
the
transepts
of
the
building
the
two
arms
of
the
capital
the
air
was
thick
with
woolly
particles
and
the
smell
of
sheep
the
floor
was
dark
and
slippery
and
everything
one
touched
humid
with
the
impalpable
grease
of
the
silky
fleeces
circulating
all
about
the
shed
strict
downright
dirty
business
was
the
order
of
the
day
the
manager
jim
urquhart
in
a
battered
felt
hat
and
a
slouchy
old
tweed
suit
stood
by
the
sorter
table
his
vigilant
eye
suddenly
fixed
upon
it
as
each
fleece
was
brought
up
shaken
out
trimmed
tested
with
thumb
and
finger
rolled
into
a
light
bundle
inside
out
and
flung
into
one
or
another
of
the
adjacent
racks
he
followed
the
process
as
if
it
were
something
new
to
him
the
shade
of
difference
in
the
texture
of
the
staple
of
one
fleece
as
compared
with
another
appeared
of
more
concern
to
him
than
the
absolute
difference
which
seemed
to
shout
for
notice
between
deborah
dalzell
and
the
other
features
of
the
scene
a
snowy
lacy
petticoat
all
but
swept
the
greasy
floor
an
equally
spotless
skirt
fresh
from
the
laundry
gathered
up
in
one
strong
pendant
hand
gleamed
like
light
against
its
background
of
greasy
woodwork
and
greasy
wool
the
majestic
figure
of
the
lady
of
redford
advanced
towards
him
her
lord
strolled
behind
her
often
but
not
for
many
a
long
day
had
the
vision
of
her
beautiful
face
come
to
jim
in
this
fashion
a
radiance
upon
prosaic
business
that
it
was
not
allowed
to
interfere
with
now
for
the
first
time
his
eye
avoided
his
heart
shrank
from
recognising
it
then
he
lifted
his
gaze
at
last
for
she
was
close
beside
him
and
what
a
ray
of
loving
shone
on
him
from
those
orbs
of
hers
undulled
by
the
years
that
had
lightly
frosted
her
dark
hair
she
put
out
her
hand
and
held
it
out
until
he
had
apologised
for
his
greasy
paw
and
given
it
to
her
warm
grasp
why
have
you
been
to
see
me
to
see
us
she
asked
him
smiling
did
you
know
we
came
home
last
night
i
thought
you
might
be
tired
or
unpacking
jim
lamely
excused
himself
but
whenever
it
is
convenient
to
you
deb
mrs
dalzell
i
am
always
close
by
i
can
come
at
any
time
he
looked
at
her
husband
claud
you
remember
jim
it
was
so
many
years
since
the
men
had
met
that
the
question
was
not
uncalled
for
they
nodded
to
each
other
across
the
enormous
gulf
that
separated
them
while
deb
explained
to
her
husband
what
an
invaluable
manager
she
had
jim
had
grown
homelier
and
shabbier
with
his
advancing
years
claud
more
and
more
exquisitely
finished
until
he
now
stood
in
his
costume
his
short
pointed
beard
the
same
tone
of
as
his
flannel
suit
his
features
the
hue
of
old
ivory
a
perfect
model
of
patrician
only
there
was
plenty
of
vigour
still
manifest
in
the
bushman
bony
frame
while
the
man
of
the
world
wore
a
valetudinarian
air
leaning
on
the
arm
of
his
regal
upright
wife
eh
is
it
like
old
times
she
mused
aloud
as
her
eyes
roamed
about
the
shed
where
every
sweating
worker
was
finding
time
to
gaze
at
her
i
see
some
of
the
old
faces
there
harry
fox
and
old
david
and
is
that
keziah
grandson
i
must
go
and
speak
to
them
she
left
her
husband
at
the
sorter
table
that
he
and
jim
might
get
reacquainted
men
never
learned
to
know
each
other
while
women
were
in
the
way
and
it
seemed
to
them
both
a
long
time
before
she
came
back
claud
asked
questions
about
the
clip
and
other
matters
of
business
and
he
criticised
the
manager
management
rather
behind
the
times
is
it
for
a
place
like
redford
i
thought
all
the
big
stations
sheared
by
machinery
now
i
only
been
waiting
for
miss
mrs
dalzell
return
to
advise
her
to
have
the
machines
said
jim
scrupulous
to
give
deb
husband
all
possible
information
we
must
have
them
of
course
i
believe
in
scientific
methods
mr
dalzell
did
not
ask
jim
how
his
sisters
were
and
how
his
brothers
were
getting
on
did
not
remember
that
he
had
any
and
when
deb
came
back
to
be
gently
but
firmly
ordered
out
of
that
dirty
place
by
her
new
lord
and
master
the
latter
failed
to
take
although
he
did
not
fail
to
perceive
the
hint
of
her
eyes
that
jim
should
be
asked
to
dinner
no
said
he
linking
his
arm
in
hers
as
they
left
the
shed
no
outsiders
debbie
i
want
you
all
to
myself
now
and
the
words
and
tone
were
so
sweet
to
her
that
she
could
not
be
sorry
for
the
possible
hurt
to
jim
feelings
she
was
young
again
today
with
her
husband
making
love
to
her
like
this
that
theory
of
their
having
come
together
merely
to
keep
each
other
warm
on
the
cold
road
to
the
grave
was
laughingly
flung
to
the
winds
she
laid
her
strong
right
hand
on
his
limp
upon
her
arm
and
expanded
her
deep
chest
to
the
sunny
morning
air
oh
claud
oh
is
it
wonderful
after
all
these
years
you
remember
that
night
that
night
in
the
garden
the
seat
is
there
still
we
will
go
and
sit
on
it
tonight
my
dear
i
dare
not
sit
out
after
sunset
so
subject
as
i
am
to
bronchitis
no
no
of
course
not
i
forgot
your
bronchitis
this
is
the
time
for
you
to
be
out
and
this
air
will
soon
make
another
man
of
you
dear
is
it
a
heavenly
climate
is
it
divine
this
sun
look
here
claud
we
got
some
capital
horses
or
we
had
i
ask
jim
what
do
you
say
to
a
ride
a
long
lovely
bush
ride
like
the
old
rides
we
used
to
have
together
words
can
not
describe
the
pang
that
went
through
her
when
he
shook
his
head
indifferently
and
said
he
was
too
old
for
such
violent
exercise
now
stuff
she
cried
besides
i
have
been
on
a
horse
for
so
long
that
i
should
know
how
to
sit
him
he
teased
her
lazily
you
would
like
to
see
me
tumble
off
at
your
hall
door
before
the
servants
would
you
oh
claud
and
to
think
how
you
used
to
ride
but
of
course
she
knew
this
was
a
joke
and
laughed
it
off
it
nothing
but
sheer
indolence
said
she
patting
the
hand
on
her
arm
that
shapely
ivory
hand
with
its
polished
filbert
nails
and
i
see
that
my
mission
in
life
is
to
cure
you
of
it
come
we
will
make
a
start
with
a
real
country
walk
she
began
to
drag
him
away
from
the
bowered
homestead
but
he
planted
his
feet
and
took
his
hand
from
her
arm
not
now
debbie
he
objected
gently
but
with
that
subtle
note
of
mastership
that
had
struck
so
sharply
into
jim
sensitiveness
it
is
and
the
letters
will
be
at
the
house
by
this
time
what
do
letters
matter
to
us
that
we
ca
tell
until
we
see
them
they
went
in
out
of
the
sunshine
to
their
in
the
shade
the
english
mail
had
arrived
and
it
was
very
interesting
letters
from
lords
and
ladies
piles
of
papers
of
fashionable
intelligence
voices
from
that
world
which
one
of
the
pair
had
already
begun
to
hanker
to
be
back
in
although
not
yet
distinctly
conscious
of
it
the
bride
fetched
her
and
busied
herself
with
a
piece
of
useless
embroidery
while
the
bridegroom
read
aloud
to
her
passages
from
the
epistles
of
his
titled
correspondents
and
from
the
printed
chronicles
of
their
doings
here
and
there
she
had
dreamed
of
his
reading
again
the
sort
of
things
that
he
used
to
read
while
she
sewed
and
listened
but
in
the
life
that
he
had
lived
and
grown
to
there
had
been
no
room
for
learning
and
the
arts
he
had
dropped
them
with
his
health
and
his
horsemanship
long
ago
the
coroneted
letters
and
the
morning
post
occupied
them
until
luncheon
at
luncheon
as
at
every
other
meal
despite
the
new
expressed
desire
to
have
his
wife
to
himself
his
valet
was
present
as
butler
watching
over
the
dyspeptic
diet
and
seeing
that
the
wine
was
right
neither
master
nor
man
trusted
anybody
else
to
do
this
it
was
a
large
crumple
in
deb
manton
attachment
to
claud
who
seemed
unable
to
do
anything
without
his
servant
help
and
the
latter
cool
relegation
of
herself
to
the
second
place
in
the
menage
it
was
all
very
well
for
her
to
give
her
husband
the
premier
place
she
did
it
gladly
but
for
manton
to
take
possession
of
redford
as
a
mere
appendage
of
his
lord
was
quite
another
matter
it
was
still
the
honeymoon
and
he
might
do
as
he
liked
or
rather
as
claud
liked
but
it
was
not
difficult
to
foresee
the
day
when
the
valet
who
dictated
to
her
cook
would
become
too
much
for
the
proud
spirit
of
the
lady
of
the
house
with
whom
it
had
ever
been
dangerous
to
make
too
free
or
to
foretell
what
would
happen
then
claud
dozed
through
the
afternoon
like
most
idle
and
luxurious
men
he
drank
a
great
deal
of
wine
which
made
him
sleepy
and
deb
took
the
opportunity
to
go
all
through
her
house
and
put
everything
in
order
they
met
again
at
tea
and
had
a
stroll
about
the
garden
and
happy
dinner
was
a
rather
silent
function
deb
wished
for
jim
and
regretted
her
easy
abandonment
of
him
claud
never
talked
when
he
was
eating
the
business
was
too
serious
and
manton
was
there
but
while
her
husband
smoked
over
his
coffee
serene
and
charming
she
sat
alone
with
him
revelling
in
his
wit
and
gaiety
telling
herself
that
he
was
indeed
the
splendid
fellow
she
had
always
thought
him
then
they
went
up
to
the
big
he
was
used
to
big
rooms
and
he
flung
himself
at
full
length
upon
one
of
the
downy
couches
and
she
put
silk
pillows
under
his
head
while
she
was
doing
it
he
pulled
her
down
to
him
and
kissed
her
it
nice
is
it
he
murmured
in
her
ear
for
answer
she
pressed
her
lips
to
his
ivory
brows
and
his
dropped
eyelids
her
big
heart
was
too
full
for
speech
now
i
am
going
to
play
to
you
she
whispered
and
went
off
to
the
old
piano
that
the
tuner
had
prepared
for
this
sacred
purpose
what
years
it
was
since
she
had
cared
to
touch
piano
keys
and
never
since
the
of
her
youth
had
she
played
as
she
did
now
all
the
old
things
that
he
had
ever
cared
for
with
the
old
passion
in
them
and
while
she
played
he
slumbered
peacefully
jim
when
his
day
of
hard
work
was
over
went
back
to
his
house
all
the
home
he
knew
had
a
bath
put
on
clean
clothes
ate
perfunctorily
of
roast
mutton
and
bread
and
jam
and
sat
down
with
his
pipe
on
the
top
step
of
his
verandah
where
he
hugged
his
knees
and
watched
the
stars
come
out
he
was
a
confirmed
old
bachelor
now
set
his
sisters
said
in
his
bachelor
ways
none
of
them
lived
with
him
to
keep
his
house
and
cheer
him
up
it
was
too
dull
for
them
with
the
mistress
of
redford
never
there
and
besides
he
did
not
want
cheering
for
himself
he
preferred
dullness
an
old
working
housekeeper
did
for
him
cooking
his
simple
meals
eggs
and
bacon
alternating
with
chops
for
breakfast
and
mutton
and
bread
and
jam
for
his
with
a
fowl
for
sundays
keeping
his
few
plain
rooms
clean
and
his
socks
mended
a
hundred
or
two
a
year
must
have
covered
his
household
expenses
the
hundreds
remaining
of
his
handsome
income
went
to
shore
up
the
of
his
kindred
who
had
the
habit
of
falling
back
on
him
when
their
funds
ran
out
or
anything
else
went
wrong
with
them
he
was
a
great
reader
books
lined
the
walls
of
his
otherwise
meagrely
furnished
rooms
they
represented
the
one
personal
extravagance
that
he
indulged
in
and
newspapers
and
magazines
came
by
every
mail
in
these
and
in
his
thoughts
he
lived
when
not
intent
upon
the
affairs
of
the
estate
which
in
the
eyes
of
some
appeared
wholly
to
absorb
him
tonight
his
thoughts
sufficed
the
latest
parcel
from
mullens
lay
untied
the
new
american
periodicals
with
wrappers
intact
deb
was
home
again
that
was
enough
food
for
the
mind
at
present
but
oh
what
a
his
own
and
only
boss
no
longer
as
heretofore
but
subject
to
a
husband
who
clearly
meant
to
be
his
master
and
as
clearly
meant
him
to
have
no
mistress
any
more
neither
in
the
way
of
business
nor
in
the
way
of
sentiment
could
she
be
again
to
him
what
she
had
been
throughout
his
life
the
altar
of
his
sacrifice
the
goddess
of
his
simple
worship
his
guide
his
goal
he
must
not
hope
nor
try
nor
even
long
for
her
now
that
one
last
comfort
was
taken
from
him
well
he
walked
about
while
the
fiercest
paroxysm
racked
him
as
some
of
us
in
our
rush
to
lotion
or
anodyne
he
sought
the
soothing
of
the
starry
night
the
cool
darkness
that
had
so
often
brought
him
peace
to
get
away
from
the
faintly
audible
tinkling
of
the
banjo
and
their
songs
he
strolled
in
the
opposite
direction
and
that
was
towards
the
dark
mass
of
the
trees
encircling
her
house
her
home
in
which
he
had
no
part
mechanically
he
noted
a
garden
gate
open
she
had
left
it
so
open
to
the
rabbits
against
which
its
section
of
the
miles
of
fencing
the
grounds
had
been
so
carefully
provided
and
he
went
forward
to
shut
it
being
there
he
had
a
distant
view
of
the
big
windows
thrown
up
and
letting
out
wide
streams
of
light
across
the
lawn
and
while
he
stood
to
gaze
at
them
picturing
what
within
he
could
not
see
he
heard
the
piano
debbie
playing
and
so
she
had
an
appreciative
audience
although
she
did
not
know
it
below
her
windows
out
of
the
light
jim
poor
old
jim
sat
like
a
statue
his
head
thrown
back
his
eyes
uplifted
tears
running
down
his
hairy
face
it
was
the
most
exquisitely
miserable
hour
of
his
life
or
so
he
thought
he
did
not
know
what
a
highly
favoured
mortal
he
really
was
in
that
his
beautiful
was
never
to
be
spoiled
by
a
happy
ending
