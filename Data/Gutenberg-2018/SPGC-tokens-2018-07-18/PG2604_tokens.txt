the
longest
journey
by
forster
part
cambridge
i
the
cow
is
there
said
ansell
lighting
a
match
and
holding
it
out
over
the
carpet
no
one
spoke
he
waited
till
the
end
of
the
match
fell
off
then
he
said
again
she
is
there
the
cow
there
you
have
not
proved
it
said
a
voice
i
have
proved
it
to
i
have
proved
to
myself
that
she
isn
t
said
the
voice
the
cow
is
not
ansell
frowned
and
lit
another
match
she
s
there
for
me
he
declared
i
don
t
care
whether
she
s
there
for
you
or
not
whether
i
m
in
cambridge
or
iceland
or
dead
the
cow
will
be
it
was
philosophy
they
were
discussing
the
existence
of
objects
do
they
exist
only
when
there
is
some
one
to
look
at
them
or
have
they
a
real
existence
of
their
own
it
is
all
very
interesting
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
difficult
hence
the
cow
she
seemed
to
make
things
easier
she
was
so
familiar
so
solid
that
surely
the
truths
that
she
illustrated
would
in
time
become
familiar
and
solid
also
is
the
cow
there
or
not
this
was
better
than
deciding
between
objectivity
and
subjectivity
so
at
oxford
just
at
the
same
time
one
was
asking
what
do
our
rooms
look
like
in
the
vac
look
here
ansell
i
m
there
in
the
meadow
the
cow
s
there
you
re
there
the
cow
s
there
do
you
agree
so
far
well
well
if
you
go
the
cow
stops
but
if
i
go
the
cow
goes
then
what
will
happen
if
you
stop
and
i
go
several
voices
cried
out
that
this
was
quibbling
i
know
it
is
said
the
speaker
brightly
and
silence
descended
again
while
they
tried
honestly
to
think
the
matter
out
rickie
on
whose
carpet
the
matches
were
being
dropped
did
not
like
to
join
in
the
discussion
it
was
too
difficult
for
him
he
could
not
even
quibble
if
he
spoke
he
should
simply
make
himself
a
fool
he
preferred
to
listen
and
to
watch
the
stealing
out
past
the
into
the
tranquil
october
air
he
could
see
the
court
too
and
the
college
cat
teasing
the
college
tortoise
and
the
with
upon
their
heads
hot
food
for
one
that
must
be
for
the
geographical
don
who
never
came
in
for
hall
cold
food
for
three
apparently
at
a
head
for
some
one
he
did
not
know
hot
food
a
la
carte
obviously
for
the
ladies
haunting
the
next
staircase
cold
food
for
two
at
two
shillings
going
to
ansell
s
rooms
for
himself
and
ansell
and
as
it
passed
under
the
lamp
he
saw
that
it
was
meringues
again
then
the
bedmakers
began
to
arrive
chatting
to
each
other
pleasantly
and
he
could
hear
ansell
s
bedmaker
say
oh
dang
when
she
found
she
had
to
lay
ansell
s
tablecloth
for
there
was
not
a
breath
stirring
the
great
elms
were
motionless
and
seemed
still
in
the
glory
of
midsummer
for
the
darkness
hid
the
yellow
blotches
on
their
leaves
and
their
outlines
were
still
rounded
against
the
tender
sky
those
elms
were
dryads
so
rickie
believed
or
pretended
and
the
line
between
the
two
is
subtler
than
we
admit
at
all
events
they
were
lady
trees
and
had
for
generations
fooled
the
college
statutes
by
their
residence
in
the
haunts
of
youth
but
what
about
the
cow
he
returned
to
her
with
a
start
for
this
would
never
do
he
also
would
try
to
think
the
matter
out
was
she
there
or
not
the
cow
there
or
not
he
strained
his
eyes
into
the
night
either
way
it
was
attractive
if
she
was
there
other
cows
were
there
too
the
darkness
of
europe
was
dotted
with
them
and
in
the
far
east
their
flanks
were
shining
in
the
rising
sun
great
herds
of
them
stood
browsing
in
pastures
where
no
man
came
nor
need
ever
come
or
plashed
by
the
brink
of
impassable
rivers
and
this
moreover
was
the
view
of
ansell
yet
tilliard
s
view
had
a
good
deal
in
it
one
might
do
worse
than
follow
tilliard
and
suppose
the
cow
not
to
be
there
unless
oneself
was
there
to
see
her
a
cowless
world
then
stretched
round
him
on
every
side
yet
he
had
only
to
peep
into
a
field
and
click
it
would
at
once
become
radiant
with
bovine
life
suddenly
he
realized
that
this
again
would
never
do
as
usual
he
had
missed
the
whole
point
and
was
overlaying
philosophy
with
gross
and
senseless
details
for
if
the
cow
was
not
there
the
world
and
the
fields
were
not
there
either
and
what
would
ansell
care
about
sunlit
flanks
or
impassable
streams
rickie
rebuked
his
own
groveling
soul
and
turned
his
eyes
away
from
the
night
which
had
led
him
to
such
absurd
conclusions
the
fire
was
dancing
and
the
shadow
of
ansell
who
stood
close
up
to
it
seemed
to
dominate
the
little
room
he
was
still
talking
or
rather
jerking
and
he
was
still
lighting
matches
and
dropping
their
ends
upon
the
carpet
now
and
then
he
would
make
a
motion
with
his
feet
as
if
he
were
running
quickly
backward
upstairs
and
would
tread
on
the
edge
of
the
fender
so
that
the
went
flying
and
the
dishes
crashed
against
each
other
in
the
hearth
the
other
philosophers
were
crouched
in
odd
shapes
on
the
sofa
and
table
and
chairs
and
one
who
was
a
little
bored
had
crawled
to
the
piano
and
was
timidly
trying
the
prelude
to
rhinegold
with
his
knee
upon
the
soft
pedal
the
air
was
heavy
with
good
and
the
pleasant
warmth
of
tea
and
as
rickie
became
more
sleepy
the
events
of
the
day
seemed
to
float
one
by
one
before
his
acquiescent
eyes
in
the
morning
he
had
read
theocritus
whom
he
believed
to
be
the
greatest
of
greek
poets
he
had
lunched
with
a
merry
don
and
had
tasted
zwieback
biscuits
then
he
had
walked
with
people
he
liked
and
had
walked
just
long
enough
and
now
his
room
was
full
of
other
people
whom
he
liked
and
when
they
left
he
would
go
and
have
supper
with
ansell
whom
he
liked
as
well
as
any
one
a
year
ago
he
had
known
none
of
these
joys
he
had
crept
cold
and
friendless
and
ignorant
out
of
a
great
public
school
preparing
for
a
silent
and
solitary
journey
and
praying
as
a
highest
favour
that
he
might
be
left
alone
cambridge
had
not
answered
his
prayer
she
had
taken
and
soothed
him
and
warmed
him
and
had
laughed
at
him
a
little
saying
that
he
must
not
be
so
tragic
yet
awhile
for
his
boyhood
had
been
but
a
dusty
corridor
that
led
to
the
spacious
halls
of
youth
in
one
year
he
had
made
many
friends
and
learnt
much
and
he
might
learn
even
more
if
he
could
but
concentrate
his
attention
on
that
cow
the
fire
had
died
down
and
in
the
gloom
the
man
by
the
piano
ventured
to
ask
what
would
happen
if
an
objective
cow
had
a
subjective
calf
ansell
gave
an
angry
sigh
and
at
that
moment
there
was
a
tap
on
the
door
come
in
said
rickie
the
door
opened
a
tall
young
woman
stood
framed
in
the
light
that
fell
from
the
passage
ladies
whispered
in
great
agitation
yes
he
said
nervously
limping
towards
the
door
he
was
rather
lame
yes
please
come
in
can
i
be
any
good
wicked
boy
exclaimed
the
young
lady
advancing
a
gloved
finger
into
the
room
wicked
wicked
boy
he
clasped
his
head
with
his
hands
agnes
oh
how
perfectly
awful
wicked
intolerable
boy
she
turned
on
the
electric
light
the
philosophers
were
revealed
with
unpleasing
suddenness
my
goodness
a
oh
really
rickie
you
are
too
bad
i
say
again
wicked
abominable
intolerable
boy
i
ll
have
you
horsewhipped
if
you
please
she
turned
to
the
symposium
which
had
now
risen
to
its
feet
if
you
please
he
asks
me
and
my
brother
for
the
we
accept
at
the
station
no
rickie
we
drive
to
where
his
old
lodgings
were
trumpery
road
or
some
such
name
and
he
s
left
them
i
m
furious
and
before
i
can
stop
my
brother
he
s
paid
off
the
cab
and
there
we
are
stranded
i
ve
walked
walked
for
miles
pray
can
you
tell
me
what
is
to
be
done
with
rickie
he
must
indeed
be
horsewhipped
said
tilliard
pleasantly
then
he
made
a
bolt
for
the
door
tilliard
do
stop
let
me
introduce
miss
pembroke
don
t
all
go
for
his
friends
were
flying
from
his
visitor
like
mists
before
the
sun
oh
agnes
i
am
so
sorry
i
ve
nothing
to
say
i
simply
forgot
you
were
coming
and
everything
about
thank
you
thank
you
and
how
soon
will
you
remember
to
ask
where
herbert
is
where
is
he
then
i
shall
not
tell
but
didn
t
he
walk
with
you
i
shall
not
tell
rickie
it
s
part
of
your
punishment
you
are
not
really
sorry
yet
i
shall
punish
you
again
she
was
quite
right
rickie
was
not
as
much
upset
as
he
ought
to
have
been
he
was
sorry
that
he
had
forgotten
and
that
he
had
caused
his
visitors
inconvenience
but
he
did
not
feel
profoundly
degraded
as
a
young
man
should
who
has
acted
discourteously
to
a
young
lady
had
he
acted
discourteously
to
his
bedmaker
or
his
gyp
he
would
have
minded
just
as
much
which
was
not
polite
of
him
first
i
ll
go
and
get
food
do
sit
down
and
rest
oh
let
me
introduce
ansell
was
now
the
sole
remnant
of
the
discussion
party
he
still
stood
on
the
hearthrug
with
a
burnt
match
in
his
hand
miss
pembroke
s
arrival
had
never
disturbed
him
let
me
introduce
ansell
miss
there
came
an
awful
moment
a
moment
when
he
almost
regretted
that
he
had
a
clever
friend
ansell
remained
absolutely
motionless
moving
neither
hand
nor
head
such
behaviour
is
so
unknown
that
miss
pembroke
did
not
realize
what
had
happened
and
kept
her
own
hand
stretched
out
longer
than
is
maidenly
coming
to
supper
asked
ansell
in
low
grave
tones
i
don
t
think
so
said
rickie
helplessly
ansell
departed
without
another
word
don
t
mind
us
said
miss
pembroke
pleasantly
why
shouldn
t
you
keep
your
engagement
with
your
friend
herbert
s
finding
lodgings
that
s
why
he
s
not
here
and
they
re
sure
to
be
able
to
give
us
some
dinner
what
jolly
rooms
you
ve
got
oh
no
not
a
bit
i
say
i
am
sorry
i
am
sorry
i
am
most
awfully
what
about
ansell
then
he
burst
forth
ansell
isn
t
a
gentleman
his
father
s
a
draper
his
uncles
are
farmers
he
s
here
because
he
s
so
clever
just
on
account
of
his
brains
now
sit
down
he
isn
t
a
gentleman
at
and
he
hurried
off
to
order
some
dinner
what
a
snob
the
boy
is
getting
thought
agnes
a
good
deal
mollified
it
never
struck
her
that
those
could
be
the
words
of
affection
that
rickie
would
never
have
spoken
them
about
a
person
whom
he
disliked
nor
did
it
strike
her
that
ansell
s
humble
birth
scarcely
explained
the
quality
of
his
rudeness
she
was
willing
to
find
life
full
of
trivialities
six
months
ago
and
she
might
have
minded
but
now
she
cared
not
what
men
might
do
unto
her
for
she
had
her
own
splendid
lover
who
could
have
knocked
all
these
unhealthy
undergraduates
into
a
she
dared
not
tell
gerald
a
word
of
what
had
happened
he
might
have
come
up
from
wherever
he
was
and
half
killed
ansell
and
she
determined
not
to
tell
her
brother
either
for
her
nature
was
kindly
and
it
pleased
her
to
pass
things
over
she
took
off
her
gloves
and
then
she
took
off
her
and
began
to
admire
them
these
were
a
freak
of
hers
her
only
freak
she
had
always
wanted
some
and
the
day
gerald
asked
her
to
marry
him
she
went
to
a
shop
and
had
her
ears
pierced
in
some
wonderful
way
she
knew
that
it
was
right
and
he
had
given
her
the
rings
little
gold
knobs
copied
the
jeweller
told
them
from
something
prehistoric
and
he
had
kissed
the
spots
of
blood
on
her
handkerchief
herbert
as
usual
had
been
shocked
i
can
t
help
it
she
cried
springing
up
i
m
not
like
other
she
began
to
pace
about
rickie
s
room
for
she
hated
to
keep
quiet
there
was
nothing
much
to
see
in
it
the
pictures
were
not
attractive
nor
did
they
attract
her
school
groups
watts
sir
percival
a
dog
running
after
a
rabbit
a
man
running
after
a
maid
a
cheap
brown
madonna
in
a
cheap
green
frame
in
short
a
collection
where
one
mediocrity
was
generally
cancelled
by
another
over
the
door
there
hung
a
long
photograph
of
a
city
with
waterways
which
agnes
who
had
never
been
to
venice
took
to
be
venice
but
which
people
who
had
been
to
stockholm
knew
to
be
stockholm
rickie
s
mother
looking
rather
sweet
was
standing
on
the
mantelpiece
some
more
pictures
had
just
arrived
from
the
framers
and
were
leaning
with
their
faces
to
the
wall
but
she
did
not
bother
to
turn
them
round
on
the
table
were
dirty
teacups
a
flat
chocolate
cake
and
omar
khayyam
with
an
oswego
biscuit
between
his
pages
also
a
vase
filled
with
the
crimson
leaves
of
autumn
this
made
her
smile
then
she
saw
her
host
s
shoes
he
had
left
them
lying
on
the
sofa
rickie
was
slightly
deformed
and
so
the
shoes
were
not
the
same
size
and
one
of
them
had
a
thick
heel
to
help
him
towards
an
even
walk
ugh
she
exclaimed
and
removed
them
gingerly
to
the
bedroom
there
she
saw
other
shoes
and
boots
and
pumps
a
whole
row
of
them
all
deformed
ugh
poor
boy
it
is
too
bad
why
shouldn
t
he
be
like
other
people
this
hereditary
business
is
too
she
shut
the
door
with
a
sigh
then
she
recalled
the
perfect
form
of
gerald
his
athletic
walk
the
poise
of
his
shoulders
his
arms
stretched
forward
to
receive
her
gradually
she
was
comforted
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
but
might
i
ask
how
many
to
lay
it
was
the
bedmaker
aberdeen
three
i
think
said
agnes
smiling
pleasantly
mr
elliot
ll
be
back
in
a
minute
he
has
gone
to
order
dinner
thank
you
plenty
of
teacups
to
wash
up
but
teacups
is
easy
washing
particularly
elliot
why
are
his
so
easy
because
no
nasty
corners
in
them
to
hold
the
dirt
anderson
he
s
crinkly
noctagons
and
one
wouldn
t
believe
the
difference
it
was
i
bought
these
for
elliot
his
one
thought
is
to
save
one
trouble
i
never
seed
such
a
thoughtful
gentleman
the
world
i
say
will
be
the
better
for
she
took
the
teacups
into
the
gyp
room
and
then
returned
with
the
tablecloth
and
added
if
he
s
i
m
afraid
he
isn
t
strong
said
agnes
oh
miss
his
nose
i
don
t
know
what
he
d
say
if
he
knew
i
mentioned
his
nose
but
really
i
must
speak
to
someone
and
he
has
neither
father
nor
mother
his
nose
it
poured
twice
with
blood
in
the
yes
it
s
a
thing
that
ought
to
be
known
i
assure
you
that
little
room
and
in
any
case
elliot
s
a
gentleman
that
can
ill
afford
to
lose
it
luckily
his
friends
were
up
and
i
always
say
they
re
more
like
brothers
than
anything
nice
for
him
he
has
no
real
oh
hornblower
he
is
a
merry
gentleman
and
tilliard
too
and
elliot
himself
likes
his
romp
at
times
why
it
s
the
merriest
staircase
in
the
buildings
last
night
the
bedmaker
from
w
said
to
me
what
are
you
doing
to
my
gentlemen
here
s
ansell
come
back
ot
with
his
collar
i
said
and
a
good
some
bedders
keep
their
gentlemen
just
so
but
surely
miss
the
world
being
what
it
is
the
longer
one
is
able
to
laugh
in
it
the
bedmakers
have
to
be
comic
and
dishonest
it
is
expected
of
them
in
a
picture
of
university
life
it
is
their
only
function
so
when
we
meet
one
who
has
the
face
of
a
lady
and
feelings
of
which
a
lady
might
be
proud
we
pass
her
by
yes
said
miss
pembroke
and
then
their
talk
was
stopped
by
the
arrival
of
her
brother
it
is
too
bad
he
exclaimed
it
is
really
too
now
bertie
boy
bertie
boy
i
ll
have
no
i
am
not
peevish
agnes
but
i
have
a
full
right
to
be
pray
why
did
he
not
meet
us
why
did
he
not
provide
rooms
and
pray
why
did
you
leave
me
to
do
all
the
settling
all
the
lodgings
i
knew
are
full
and
our
bedrooms
look
into
a
mews
i
can
not
help
it
and
then
look
here
it
really
is
too
he
held
up
his
foot
like
a
wounded
dog
it
was
dripping
with
water
oho
this
explains
the
peevishness
off
with
it
at
once
it
ll
be
another
of
your
i
really
think
i
had
he
sat
down
by
the
fire
and
daintily
unlaced
his
boot
i
notice
a
great
change
in
university
tone
i
can
never
remember
swaggering
three
abreast
along
the
pavement
and
charging
inoffensive
visitors
into
a
gutter
when
i
was
an
undergraduate
one
of
the
men
too
wore
an
eton
tie
but
the
others
i
should
say
came
from
very
queer
schools
if
they
came
from
any
schools
at
pembroke
was
nearly
twenty
years
older
than
his
sister
and
had
never
been
as
handsome
but
he
was
not
at
all
the
person
to
knock
into
a
gutter
for
though
not
in
orders
he
had
the
air
of
being
on
the
verge
of
them
and
his
features
as
well
as
his
clothes
had
the
clerical
cut
in
his
presence
conversation
became
pure
and
colourless
and
full
of
understatements
and
just
as
if
he
was
a
real
clergyman
neither
men
nor
boys
ever
forgot
that
he
was
there
he
had
observed
this
and
it
pleased
him
very
much
his
conscience
permitted
him
to
enter
the
church
whenever
his
profession
which
was
the
scholastic
should
demand
it
no
gutter
in
the
world
s
as
wet
as
this
said
agnes
who
had
peeled
off
her
brother
s
sock
and
was
now
toasting
it
at
the
embers
on
a
pair
of
tongs
surely
you
know
the
running
water
by
the
edge
of
the
trumpington
road
it
s
turned
on
occasionally
to
clear
away
the
refuse
a
most
primitive
idea
when
i
was
up
we
had
a
joke
about
it
and
called
it
the
how
complimentary
you
foolish
girl
not
after
me
of
course
we
called
it
the
pem
because
it
is
close
to
pembroke
college
i
remember
he
smiled
a
little
and
twiddled
his
toes
then
he
remembered
the
bedmaker
and
said
my
sock
is
now
dry
my
sock
your
sock
is
sopping
no
you
don
t
she
twitched
the
tongs
away
from
him
aberdeen
without
speaking
fetched
a
pair
of
rickie
s
socks
and
a
pair
of
rickie
s
shoes
thank
you
ah
thank
you
i
am
sure
elliot
would
allow
then
he
said
in
french
to
his
sister
has
there
been
the
slightest
sign
of
frederick
now
do
call
him
rickie
and
talk
english
i
found
him
here
he
had
forgotten
about
us
and
was
very
sorry
now
he
s
gone
to
get
some
dinner
and
i
can
t
think
why
he
isn
t
aberdeen
left
them
he
wants
pulling
up
sharply
there
is
nothing
original
in
true
originality
lies
elsewhere
really
the
lower
classes
have
no
nous
however
can
i
wear
such
deformities
for
he
had
been
madly
trying
to
cram
a
foot
into
a
shoe
don
t
said
agnes
hastily
don
t
touch
the
poor
fellow
s
the
sight
of
the
smart
stubby
patent
leather
made
her
almost
feel
faint
she
had
known
rickie
for
many
years
but
it
seemed
so
dreadful
and
so
different
now
that
he
was
a
man
it
was
her
first
great
contact
with
the
abnormal
and
unknown
fibres
of
her
being
rose
in
revolt
against
it
she
frowned
when
she
heard
his
uneven
tread
upon
the
stairs
agnes
before
he
arrives
you
ought
never
to
have
left
me
and
gone
to
his
rooms
alone
a
most
elementary
transgression
imagine
the
unpleasantness
if
you
had
found
him
with
friends
if
gerald
rickie
by
now
had
got
into
a
fluster
at
the
kitchens
he
had
lost
his
head
and
when
his
turn
came
he
had
had
to
wait
he
had
yielded
his
place
to
those
behind
saying
that
he
didn
t
matter
and
he
had
wasted
more
precious
time
buying
bananas
though
he
knew
that
the
pembrokes
were
not
partial
to
fruit
amid
much
tardy
and
chaotic
hospitality
the
meal
got
under
way
all
the
spoons
and
forks
were
anyhow
for
aberdeen
s
virtues
were
not
practical
the
fish
seemed
never
to
have
been
alive
the
meat
had
no
kick
and
the
cork
of
the
college
claret
slid
forth
silently
as
if
ashamed
of
the
contents
agnes
was
particularly
pleasant
but
her
brother
could
not
recover
himself
he
still
remembered
their
desolate
arrival
and
he
could
feel
the
waters
of
the
pem
eating
into
his
instep
rickie
cried
the
lady
are
you
aware
that
you
haven
t
congratulated
me
on
my
engagement
rickie
laughed
nervously
and
said
why
no
no
more
i
say
something
pretty
i
hope
you
ll
be
very
happy
he
mumbled
but
i
don
t
know
anything
about
oh
you
awful
boy
herbert
isn
t
he
just
the
same
but
you
do
know
something
about
gerald
so
don
t
be
so
chilly
and
cautious
i
ve
just
realized
looking
at
those
groups
that
you
must
have
been
at
school
together
did
you
come
much
across
him
very
little
he
answered
and
sounded
shy
he
got
up
hastily
and
began
to
muddle
with
the
coffee
but
he
was
in
the
same
house
surely
that
s
a
house
group
he
was
a
he
made
his
coffee
on
the
simple
system
one
had
a
brown
pot
into
which
the
boiling
stuff
was
poured
just
before
serving
one
put
in
a
drop
of
cold
water
and
the
idea
was
that
the
grounds
fell
to
the
bottom
wasn
t
he
a
kind
of
athletic
marvel
couldn
t
he
knock
any
boy
or
master
down
if
he
had
wanted
to
said
pembroke
who
had
not
spoken
for
some
time
if
he
had
wanted
to
echoed
rickie
i
do
hope
agnes
you
ll
be
most
awfully
happy
i
don
t
know
anything
about
the
army
but
i
should
think
it
must
be
most
awfully
pembroke
laughed
faintly
yes
rickie
the
army
is
a
most
interesting
profession
the
profession
of
wellington
and
marlborough
and
lord
roberts
a
most
interesting
profession
as
you
observe
a
profession
that
may
mean
death
death
rather
than
that
s
nice
said
rickie
speaking
to
himself
any
profession
may
mean
dishonour
but
one
isn
t
allowed
to
die
instead
the
army
s
different
if
a
soldier
makes
a
mess
it
s
thought
rather
decent
of
him
isn
t
it
if
he
blows
out
his
brains
in
the
other
professions
it
somehow
seems
i
am
not
competent
to
pronounce
said
pembroke
who
was
not
accustomed
to
have
his
schoolroom
satire
commented
on
i
merely
know
that
the
army
is
the
finest
profession
in
the
world
which
reminds
me
rickie
have
you
been
thinking
about
yours
not
at
all
now
herbert
don
t
bother
him
have
another
but
rickie
my
dear
boy
you
re
twenty
it
s
time
you
thought
the
tripos
is
the
beginning
of
life
not
the
end
in
less
than
two
years
you
will
have
got
your
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
i
don
t
you
re
aren
t
you
asked
agnes
but
her
brother
proceeded
i
have
seen
so
many
promising
brilliant
lives
wrecked
simply
on
account
of
this
not
settling
soon
enough
my
dear
boy
you
must
think
consult
your
tastes
if
possible
but
think
you
have
not
a
moment
to
lose
the
bar
like
your
father
oh
i
wouldn
t
like
that
at
i
don
t
mention
the
oh
rickie
do
be
a
clergyman
said
miss
pembroke
you
d
be
simply
killing
in
a
he
looked
at
his
guests
hopelessly
their
kindness
and
competence
overwhelmed
him
i
wish
i
could
talk
to
them
as
i
talk
to
myself
he
thought
i
m
not
such
an
ass
when
i
talk
to
myself
i
don
t
believe
for
instance
that
quite
all
i
thought
about
the
cow
was
aloud
he
said
i
ve
sometimes
wondered
about
writing
said
pembroke
with
the
tone
of
one
who
gives
everything
its
trial
well
what
about
writing
what
kind
of
writing
i
rather
like
he
suppressed
something
in
his
throat
i
rather
like
trying
to
write
little
why
i
made
sure
it
was
poetry
said
agnes
you
re
just
the
boy
for
i
had
no
idea
you
wrote
would
you
let
me
see
something
then
i
could
the
author
shook
his
head
i
don
t
show
it
to
any
one
it
isn
t
anything
i
just
try
because
it
amuses
what
is
it
about
silly
are
you
ever
going
to
show
it
to
any
one
i
don
t
think
pembroke
did
not
reply
firstly
because
the
meringue
he
was
eating
was
after
all
rickie
s
secondly
because
it
was
gluey
and
stuck
his
jaws
together
agnes
observed
that
the
writing
was
really
a
very
good
idea
there
was
rickie
s
aunt
she
could
push
him
aunt
emily
never
pushes
any
one
she
says
they
always
rebound
and
crush
i
only
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
your
aunt
once
i
should
have
thought
her
a
quite
uncrushable
person
but
she
would
be
sure
to
help
i
couldn
t
show
her
anything
she
d
think
them
even
sillier
than
they
always
running
yourself
down
there
speaks
the
artist
i
m
not
modest
he
said
anxiously
i
just
know
they
re
pembroke
s
teeth
were
clear
of
meringue
and
he
could
refrain
no
longer
my
dear
rickie
your
father
and
mother
are
dead
and
you
often
say
your
aunt
takes
no
interest
in
you
therefore
your
life
depends
on
yourself
think
it
over
carefully
but
settle
and
having
once
settled
stick
if
you
think
that
this
writing
is
practicable
and
that
you
could
make
your
living
by
it
that
you
could
if
needs
be
support
a
wife
then
by
all
means
write
but
you
must
work
work
and
drudge
begin
at
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
and
work
rickie
s
head
drooped
any
metaphor
silenced
him
he
never
thought
of
replying
that
art
is
not
a
ladder
with
a
curate
as
it
were
on
the
first
rung
a
rector
on
the
second
and
a
bishop
still
nearer
heaven
at
the
top
he
never
retorted
that
the
artist
is
not
a
bricklayer
at
all
but
a
horseman
whose
business
it
is
to
catch
pegasus
at
once
not
to
practise
for
him
by
mounting
tamer
colts
this
is
hard
hot
and
generally
ungraceful
work
but
it
is
not
drudgery
for
drudgery
is
not
art
and
can
not
lead
to
it
of
course
i
don
t
really
think
about
writing
he
said
as
he
poured
the
cold
water
into
the
coffee
even
if
my
things
ever
were
decent
i
don
t
think
the
magazines
would
take
them
and
the
magazines
are
one
s
only
chance
i
read
somewhere
too
that
marie
corelli
s
about
the
only
person
who
makes
a
thing
out
of
literature
i
m
certain
it
wouldn
t
pay
i
never
mentioned
the
word
pay
said
pembroke
uneasily
you
must
not
consider
money
there
are
ideals
i
have
no
rickie
she
exclaimed
horrible
boy
no
agnes
i
have
no
then
he
got
very
red
for
it
was
a
phrase
he
had
caught
from
ansell
and
he
could
not
remember
what
came
next
the
person
who
has
no
ideals
she
exclaimed
is
to
be
i
think
so
too
said
pembroke
sipping
his
coffee
life
without
an
ideal
would
be
like
the
sky
without
the
rickie
looked
towards
the
night
wherein
there
now
twinkled
innumerable
stars
gods
and
heroes
virgins
and
brides
to
whom
the
greeks
have
given
their
names
life
without
an
ideal
repeated
pembroke
and
then
stopped
for
his
mouth
was
full
of
coffee
grounds
the
same
affliction
had
overtaken
agnes
after
a
little
jocose
laughter
they
departed
to
their
lodgings
and
rickie
having
seen
them
as
far
as
the
porter
s
lodge
hurried
singing
as
he
went
to
ansell
s
room
burst
open
the
door
and
said
look
here
whatever
do
you
mean
by
it
by
what
ansell
was
sitting
alone
with
a
piece
of
paper
in
front
of
him
on
it
was
a
diagram
a
circle
inside
a
square
inside
which
was
again
a
square
by
being
so
rude
you
re
no
gentleman
and
i
told
her
he
slammed
him
on
the
head
with
a
sofa
cushion
i
m
certain
one
ought
to
be
polite
even
to
people
who
aren
t
not
saved
was
a
phrase
they
applied
just
then
to
those
whom
they
did
not
like
or
intimately
know
and
i
believe
she
is
saved
i
never
knew
any
one
so
always
and
kind
she
s
been
kind
to
me
ever
since
i
knew
her
i
wish
you
d
heard
her
trying
to
stop
her
brother
you
d
have
certainly
come
round
not
but
what
he
was
only
being
nice
as
well
but
she
is
really
nice
and
i
thought
she
came
into
the
room
so
beautifully
do
you
know
oh
of
course
you
despise
music
but
anderson
was
playing
wagner
and
he
d
just
got
to
the
part
where
they
sing
rheingold
rheingold
and
the
sun
strikes
into
the
waters
and
the
music
which
up
to
then
has
so
often
been
in
e
flat
goes
into
d
sharp
i
have
not
understood
a
single
word
partly
because
you
talk
as
if
your
mouth
was
full
of
plums
partly
because
i
don
t
know
whom
you
re
talking
miss
pembroke
whom
you
i
saw
no
who
came
in
no
one
came
you
re
an
ass
shrieked
rickie
she
came
in
you
saw
her
come
in
she
and
her
brother
have
been
to
you
only
think
so
they
were
not
really
but
they
stop
till
you
only
think
that
they
are
but
oh
look
here
shut
up
the
girl
like
an
empress
i
saw
no
empress
nor
any
girl
nor
have
you
seen
ansell
don
t
elliot
i
never
rag
and
you
know
it
she
was
not
really
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
then
rickie
exclaimed
i
ve
got
you
you
say
or
was
it
tilliard
no
you
say
that
the
cow
s
there
well
there
these
people
are
then
got
you
yah
did
it
never
strike
you
that
phenomena
may
be
of
two
kinds
one
those
which
have
a
real
existence
such
as
the
cow
two
those
which
are
the
subjective
product
of
a
diseased
imagination
and
which
to
our
destruction
we
invest
with
the
semblance
of
reality
if
this
never
struck
you
let
it
strike
you
rickie
spoke
again
but
received
no
answer
he
paced
a
little
up
and
down
the
sombre
roam
then
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
watched
his
clever
friend
draw
within
the
square
a
circle
and
within
the
circle
a
square
and
inside
that
another
circle
and
inside
that
another
square
why
will
you
do
that
no
answer
are
they
real
the
inside
one
is
the
one
in
the
middle
of
everything
that
there
s
never
room
enough
to
ii
a
little
this
side
of
madingley
to
the
left
of
the
road
there
is
a
secluded
dell
paved
with
grass
and
planted
with
it
could
not
have
been
worth
a
visit
twenty
years
ago
for
then
it
was
only
a
scar
of
chalk
and
it
is
not
worth
a
visit
at
the
present
day
for
the
trees
have
grown
too
thick
and
choked
it
but
when
rickie
was
up
it
chanced
to
be
the
brief
season
of
its
romance
a
season
as
brief
for
a
as
a
man
its
divine
interval
between
the
bareness
of
boyhood
and
the
stuffiness
of
age
rickie
had
discovered
it
in
his
second
term
when
the
january
snows
had
melted
and
left
fiords
and
lagoons
of
clearest
water
between
the
inequalities
of
the
floor
the
place
looked
as
big
as
switzerland
or
norway
as
indeed
for
the
moment
it
was
and
he
came
upon
it
at
a
time
when
his
life
too
was
beginning
to
expand
accordingly
the
dell
became
for
him
a
kind
of
church
a
church
where
indeed
you
could
do
anything
you
liked
but
where
anything
you
did
would
be
transfigured
like
the
ancient
greeks
he
could
even
laugh
at
his
holy
place
and
leave
it
no
less
holy
he
chatted
gaily
about
it
and
about
the
pleasant
thoughts
with
which
it
inspired
him
he
took
his
friends
there
he
even
took
people
whom
he
did
not
like
procul
este
profani
exclaimed
a
delighted
aesthete
on
being
introduced
to
it
but
this
was
never
to
be
the
attitude
of
rickie
he
did
not
love
the
vulgar
herd
but
he
knew
that
his
own
vulgarity
would
be
greater
if
he
forbade
it
ingress
and
that
it
was
not
by
preciosity
that
he
would
attain
to
the
intimate
spirit
of
the
dell
indeed
if
he
had
agreed
with
the
aesthete
he
would
possibly
not
have
introduced
him
if
the
dell
was
to
bear
any
inscription
he
would
have
liked
it
to
be
this
way
to
heaven
painted
on
a
by
the
and
he
did
not
realize
till
later
years
that
the
number
of
visitors
would
not
thereby
have
sensibly
increased
on
the
blessed
monday
that
the
pembrokes
left
he
walked
out
here
with
three
friends
it
was
a
day
when
the
sky
seemed
enormous
one
cloud
as
large
as
a
continent
was
voyaging
near
the
sun
whilst
other
clouds
seemed
anchored
to
the
horizon
too
lazy
or
too
happy
to
move
the
sky
itself
was
of
the
palest
blue
paling
to
white
where
it
approached
the
earth
and
the
earth
brown
wet
and
odorous
was
engaged
beneath
it
on
its
yearly
duty
of
decay
rickie
was
open
to
the
complexities
of
autumn
he
felt
extremely
tiny
extremely
tiny
and
extremely
important
and
perhaps
the
combination
is
as
fair
as
any
that
exists
he
hoped
that
all
his
life
he
would
never
be
peevish
or
unkind
elliot
is
in
a
dangerous
state
said
ansell
they
had
reached
the
dell
and
had
stood
for
some
time
in
silence
each
leaning
against
a
tree
it
was
too
wet
to
sit
down
how
s
that
asked
rickie
who
had
not
known
he
was
in
any
state
at
all
he
shut
up
keats
whom
he
thought
he
had
been
reading
and
slipped
him
back
into
his
scarcely
ever
was
he
without
a
book
he
s
trying
to
like
then
he
s
done
for
said
widdrington
he
s
he
s
trying
to
like
the
others
gave
shrill
agonized
cries
he
wants
to
bind
the
college
together
he
wants
to
link
us
to
the
beefy
i
do
like
hornblower
he
protested
i
don
t
and
hornblower
tries
to
like
that
part
doesn
t
but
he
does
try
to
like
you
he
tries
not
to
despise
you
it
is
altogether
a
most
tilliard
started
them
said
widdrington
tilliard
thinks
it
such
a
pity
the
college
should
be
split
into
oh
tilliard
said
ansell
with
much
irritation
but
what
can
you
expect
from
a
person
who
s
eternally
beautiful
the
other
night
we
had
been
discussing
a
long
time
and
suddenly
the
light
was
turned
on
every
one
else
looked
a
sight
as
they
ought
but
there
was
tilliard
sitting
neatly
on
a
little
chair
like
an
undersized
god
with
not
a
curl
crooked
i
should
say
he
will
get
into
the
foreign
why
are
most
of
us
so
ugly
laughed
rickie
it
s
merely
a
sign
of
our
salvation
merely
another
sign
that
the
college
is
the
college
isn
t
split
cried
rickie
who
got
excited
on
this
subject
with
unfailing
regularity
the
college
is
and
has
been
and
always
will
be
one
what
you
call
the
beefy
set
aren
t
a
set
at
all
they
re
just
the
rowing
people
and
naturally
they
chiefly
see
each
other
but
they
re
always
nice
to
me
or
to
any
one
of
course
they
think
us
rather
asses
but
it
s
quite
in
a
pleasant
that
s
my
whole
objection
said
ansell
what
right
have
they
to
think
us
asses
in
a
pleasant
way
why
don
t
they
hate
us
what
right
has
hornblower
to
smack
me
on
the
back
when
i
ve
been
rude
to
him
well
what
right
have
you
to
be
rude
to
him
because
i
hate
him
you
think
it
is
so
splendid
to
hate
no
one
i
tell
you
it
is
a
crime
you
want
to
love
every
one
equally
and
that
s
worse
than
impossible
it
s
wrong
when
you
denounce
sets
you
re
really
trying
to
destroy
i
maintain
said
rickie
it
was
a
verb
he
clung
to
in
the
hope
that
it
would
lend
stability
to
what
followed
i
maintain
that
one
can
like
many
more
people
than
one
and
i
maintain
that
you
hate
many
more
people
than
you
i
hate
no
one
he
exclaimed
with
extraordinary
vehemence
and
the
dell
that
it
hated
no
one
we
are
obliged
to
believe
you
said
widdrington
smiling
a
little
but
we
are
sorry
about
not
even
your
father
asked
ansell
rickie
was
silent
not
even
your
father
the
cloud
above
extended
a
great
promontory
across
the
sun
it
only
lay
there
for
a
moment
yet
that
was
enough
to
summon
the
lurking
coldness
from
the
earth
does
he
hate
his
father
said
widdrington
who
had
not
known
oh
good
but
his
father
s
dead
he
will
say
it
doesn
t
still
it
s
something
do
you
hate
yours
ansell
did
not
reply
rickie
said
i
say
i
wonder
whether
one
ought
to
talk
like
this
about
hating
dead
people
yes
did
you
hate
your
mother
asked
widdrington
rickie
turned
crimson
i
don
t
see
hornblower
s
such
a
rotter
remarked
the
other
man
whose
name
was
james
james
you
are
diplomatic
said
ansell
you
are
trying
to
tide
over
an
awkward
moment
you
can
widdrington
was
crimson
too
in
his
wish
to
be
sprightly
he
had
used
words
without
thinking
of
their
meanings
suddenly
he
realized
that
father
and
mother
really
meant
father
and
mother
people
whom
he
had
himself
at
home
he
was
very
uncomfortable
and
thought
rickie
had
been
rather
queer
he
too
tried
to
revert
to
hornblower
but
ansell
would
not
let
him
the
sun
came
out
and
struck
on
the
white
ramparts
of
the
dell
rickie
looked
straight
at
it
then
he
said
abruptly
i
think
i
want
to
i
think
you
do
replied
ansell
shouldn
t
i
be
rather
a
fool
if
i
went
through
cambridge
without
talking
it
s
said
never
to
come
so
easy
again
all
the
people
are
dead
too
i
can
t
see
why
i
shouldn
t
tell
you
most
things
about
my
birth
and
parentage
and
talk
away
if
you
bore
us
we
have
with
this
invitation
rickie
began
to
relate
his
history
the
reader
who
has
no
book
will
be
obliged
to
listen
to
it
some
people
spend
their
lives
in
a
suburb
and
not
for
any
urgent
reason
this
had
been
the
fate
of
rickie
he
had
opened
his
eyes
to
filmy
heavens
and
taken
his
first
walk
on
asphalt
he
had
seen
civilization
as
a
row
of
villas
and
society
as
a
state
in
which
men
do
not
know
the
men
who
live
next
door
he
had
himself
become
part
of
the
grey
monotony
that
surrounds
all
cities
there
was
no
necessity
for
this
it
was
only
rather
convenient
to
his
father
elliot
was
a
barrister
in
appearance
he
resembled
his
son
being
weakly
and
lame
with
hollow
little
cheeks
a
broad
white
band
of
forehead
and
stiff
impoverished
hair
his
voice
which
he
did
not
transmit
was
very
suave
with
a
fine
command
of
cynical
intonation
by
altering
it
ever
so
little
he
could
make
people
wince
especially
if
they
were
simple
or
poor
nor
did
he
transmit
his
eyes
their
peculiar
flatness
as
if
the
soul
looked
through
dirty
the
unkindness
of
them
the
cowardice
the
fear
in
them
were
to
trouble
the
world
no
longer
he
married
a
girl
whose
voice
was
beautiful
there
was
no
caress
in
it
yet
all
who
heard
it
were
soothed
as
though
the
world
held
some
unexpected
blessing
she
called
to
her
dogs
one
night
over
invisible
waters
and
he
a
tourist
up
on
the
bridge
thought
that
is
extraordinarily
in
time
he
discovered
that
her
figure
face
and
thoughts
were
adequate
also
and
as
she
was
not
impossible
socially
he
married
her
i
have
taken
a
plunge
he
told
his
family
the
family
hostile
at
first
had
not
a
word
to
say
when
the
woman
was
introduced
to
them
and
his
sister
declared
that
the
plunge
had
been
taken
from
the
opposite
bank
things
only
went
right
for
a
little
time
though
beautiful
without
and
within
elliot
had
not
the
gift
of
making
her
home
beautiful
and
one
day
when
she
bought
a
carpet
for
the
that
clashed
he
laughed
gently
said
he
really
couldn
t
and
departed
departure
is
perhaps
too
strong
a
word
in
elliot
s
mouth
it
became
my
husband
has
to
sleep
more
in
he
often
came
down
to
see
them
nearly
always
unexpectedly
and
occasionally
they
went
to
see
him
father
s
house
as
rickie
called
it
only
had
three
rooms
but
these
were
full
of
books
and
pictures
and
flowers
and
the
flowers
instead
of
being
squashed
down
into
the
vases
as
they
were
in
mummy
s
house
rose
gracefully
from
frames
of
lead
which
lay
coiled
at
the
bottom
as
doubtless
the
sea
serpent
has
to
lie
coiled
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
once
he
was
let
to
lift
a
frame
out
only
once
for
he
dropped
some
water
on
a
creton
i
think
he
s
going
to
have
taste
said
elliot
languidly
it
is
quite
possible
his
wife
replied
she
had
not
taken
off
her
hat
and
gloves
nor
even
pulled
up
her
veil
elliot
laughed
and
soon
afterwards
another
lady
came
in
and
they
went
away
why
does
father
always
laugh
asked
rickie
in
the
evening
when
he
and
his
mother
were
sitting
in
the
nursery
it
is
a
way
of
your
father
why
does
he
always
laugh
at
me
am
i
so
funny
then
after
a
pause
you
have
no
sense
of
humour
have
you
mummy
elliot
who
was
raising
a
thread
of
cotton
to
her
lips
held
it
suspended
in
amazement
you
told
him
so
this
afternoon
but
i
have
seen
you
he
nodded
wisely
i
have
seen
you
laugh
ever
so
often
one
day
you
were
laughing
alone
all
down
in
the
sweet
was
i
yes
were
you
laughing
at
me
i
was
not
thinking
about
you
cotton
please
a
reel
of
no
white
from
my
chest
of
drawers
left
hand
drawer
now
which
is
your
left
hand
the
side
my
pocket
and
if
you
had
no
pocket
the
side
my
bad
foot
i
meant
you
to
say
the
side
my
heart
is
said
elliot
holding
up
the
duster
between
them
most
of
us
i
mean
all
of
us
can
feel
on
one
side
a
little
watch
that
never
stops
ticking
so
even
if
you
had
no
bad
foot
you
would
still
know
which
is
the
left
no
white
please
no
i
ll
get
it
for
she
had
remembered
that
the
dark
passage
frightened
him
these
were
the
outlines
rickie
filled
them
in
with
the
slowness
and
the
accuracy
of
a
child
he
was
never
told
anything
but
he
discovered
for
himself
that
his
father
and
mother
did
not
love
each
other
and
that
his
mother
was
lovable
he
discovered
that
elliot
had
dubbed
him
rickie
because
he
was
rickety
that
he
took
pleasure
in
alluding
to
his
son
s
deformity
and
was
sorry
that
it
was
not
more
serious
than
his
own
elliot
had
not
one
scrap
of
genius
he
gathered
the
pictures
and
the
books
and
the
mechanically
not
in
any
impulse
of
love
he
passed
for
a
cultured
man
because
he
knew
how
to
select
and
he
passed
for
an
unconventional
man
because
he
did
not
select
quite
like
other
people
in
reality
he
never
did
or
said
or
thought
one
single
thing
that
had
the
slightest
beauty
or
value
and
in
time
rickie
discovered
this
as
well
the
boy
grew
up
in
great
loneliness
he
worshipped
his
mother
and
she
was
fond
of
him
but
she
was
dignified
and
reticent
and
pathos
like
tattle
was
disgusting
to
her
she
was
afraid
of
intimacy
in
case
it
led
to
confidences
and
tears
and
so
all
her
life
she
held
her
son
at
a
little
distance
her
kindness
and
unselfishness
knew
no
limits
but
if
he
tried
to
be
dramatic
and
thank
her
she
told
him
not
to
be
a
little
goose
and
so
the
only
person
he
came
to
know
at
all
was
himself
he
would
play
halma
against
himself
he
would
conduct
solitary
conversations
in
which
one
part
of
him
asked
and
another
part
answered
it
was
an
exciting
game
and
concluded
with
the
formula
thank
you
i
am
glad
to
have
met
you
i
hope
before
long
we
shall
enjoy
another
and
then
perhaps
he
would
sob
for
loneliness
for
he
would
see
real
people
real
brothers
real
friends
doing
in
warm
life
the
things
he
had
pretended
shall
i
ever
have
a
friend
he
demanded
at
the
age
of
twelve
i
don
t
see
how
they
walk
too
fast
and
a
brother
i
shall
never
no
loss
interrupted
widdrington
but
i
shall
never
have
one
and
so
i
quite
want
one
even
when
he
was
thirteen
elliot
entered
on
his
illness
the
pretty
rooms
in
town
would
not
do
for
an
invalid
and
so
he
came
back
to
his
home
one
of
the
first
consequences
was
that
rickie
was
sent
to
a
public
school
elliot
did
what
she
could
but
she
had
no
hold
whatever
over
her
husband
he
worries
me
he
declared
he
s
a
joke
of
which
i
have
got
would
it
be
possible
to
send
him
to
a
private
tutor
s
no
said
elliot
who
had
all
the
money
i
agree
that
boys
ought
to
rough
it
but
when
a
boy
is
lame
and
very
delicate
he
roughs
it
sufficiently
if
he
leaves
home
rickie
can
t
play
games
he
doesn
t
make
friends
he
isn
t
brilliant
thinking
it
over
i
feel
that
as
it
s
like
this
we
can
t
ever
hope
to
give
him
the
ordinary
education
perhaps
you
could
think
it
over
no
i
am
sure
that
things
are
best
for
him
as
they
are
the
knocks
quite
as
many
corners
off
him
as
he
can
stand
he
hates
it
but
it
is
good
for
him
a
public
school
will
not
be
good
for
him
it
is
too
rough
instead
of
getting
manly
and
hard
he
will
my
head
rickie
departed
in
a
state
of
bewildered
misery
which
was
scarcely
ever
to
grow
clearer
each
holiday
he
found
his
father
more
irritable
and
a
little
weaker
elliot
was
quickly
growing
old
she
had
to
manage
the
servants
to
hush
the
neighbouring
children
to
answer
the
correspondence
to
paper
and
the
rooms
and
all
for
the
sake
of
a
man
whom
she
did
not
like
and
who
did
not
conceal
his
dislike
for
her
one
day
she
found
rickie
tearful
and
said
rather
crossly
well
what
is
it
this
time
he
replied
oh
mummy
i
ve
seen
your
wrinkles
your
grey
hair
i
m
sudden
tenderness
overcame
her
and
she
cried
my
darling
what
does
it
matter
whatever
does
it
matter
now
he
had
never
known
her
so
emotional
yet
even
better
did
he
remember
another
incident
hearing
high
voices
from
his
father
s
room
he
went
upstairs
in
the
hope
that
the
sound
of
his
tread
might
stop
them
elliot
burst
open
the
door
and
seeing
him
exclaimed
my
dear
if
you
please
he
s
hit
she
tried
to
laugh
it
off
but
a
few
hours
later
he
saw
the
bruise
which
the
stick
of
the
invalid
had
raised
upon
his
mother
s
hand
god
alone
knows
how
far
we
are
in
the
grip
of
our
bodies
he
alone
can
judge
how
far
the
cruelty
of
elliot
was
the
outcome
of
extenuating
circumstances
but
elliot
could
accurately
judge
of
its
extent
at
last
he
died
rickie
was
now
fifteen
and
got
off
a
whole
week
s
school
for
the
funeral
his
mother
was
rather
strange
she
was
much
happier
she
looked
younger
and
her
mourning
was
as
unobtrusive
as
convention
permitted
all
this
he
had
expected
but
she
seemed
to
be
watching
him
and
to
be
extremely
anxious
for
his
opinion
on
any
subject
more
especially
on
his
father
why
at
last
he
saw
that
she
was
trying
to
establish
confidence
between
them
but
confidence
can
not
be
established
in
a
moment
they
were
both
shy
the
habit
of
years
was
upon
them
and
they
alluded
to
the
death
of
elliot
as
an
irreparable
loss
now
that
your
father
has
gone
things
will
be
very
shall
we
be
poorer
mother
no
oh
but
naturally
things
will
be
very
yes
for
instance
your
poor
father
liked
being
near
london
but
i
almost
think
we
might
move
would
you
like
that
of
course
he
looked
down
at
the
ground
he
was
not
accustomed
to
being
consulted
and
it
bewildered
him
perhaps
you
might
like
quite
a
different
life
better
he
giggled
it
s
a
little
difficult
for
me
said
elliot
pacing
vigorously
up
and
down
the
room
and
more
and
more
did
her
black
dress
seem
a
mockery
in
some
ways
you
ought
to
be
consulted
nearly
all
the
money
is
left
to
you
as
you
must
hear
some
time
or
other
but
in
other
ways
you
re
only
a
boy
what
am
i
to
do
i
don
t
know
he
replied
appearing
more
helpless
and
unhelpful
than
he
really
was
for
instance
would
you
like
me
to
arrange
things
exactly
as
i
like
oh
do
he
exclaimed
thinking
this
a
most
brilliant
suggestion
the
very
nicest
thing
of
and
he
added
in
his
way
i
shall
be
as
wax
in
your
hands
she
smiled
very
well
darling
you
shall
and
she
pressed
him
lovingly
as
though
she
would
mould
him
into
something
beautiful
for
the
next
few
days
great
preparations
were
in
the
air
she
went
to
see
his
father
s
sister
the
gifted
and
vivacious
aunt
emily
they
were
to
live
in
the
country
somewhere
right
in
the
country
with
grass
and
trees
up
to
the
door
and
birds
singing
everywhere
and
a
tutor
for
he
was
not
to
go
back
to
school
unbelievable
he
was
never
to
go
back
to
school
and
the
had
written
saying
that
he
regretted
the
step
but
that
possibly
it
was
a
wise
one
it
was
raw
weather
and
elliot
watched
over
him
with
ceaseless
tenderness
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
not
do
too
much
to
shield
him
and
to
draw
him
nearer
to
her
put
on
your
greatcoat
dearest
she
said
to
him
i
don
t
think
i
want
it
answered
rickie
remembering
that
he
was
now
fifteen
the
wind
is
bitter
you
ought
to
put
it
but
it
s
so
do
put
it
on
he
was
not
very
often
irritable
or
rude
but
he
answered
oh
i
shan
t
catch
cold
i
do
wish
you
wouldn
t
keep
on
he
did
not
catch
cold
but
while
he
was
out
his
mother
died
she
only
survived
her
husband
eleven
days
a
coincidence
which
was
recorded
on
their
tombstone
such
in
substance
was
the
story
which
rickie
told
his
friends
as
they
stood
together
in
the
shelter
of
the
dell
the
green
bank
at
the
entrance
hid
the
road
and
the
world
and
now
as
in
spring
they
could
see
nothing
but
ramparts
and
the
evergreen
foliage
of
the
firs
only
from
time
to
time
would
a
beech
leaf
flutter
in
from
the
woods
above
to
comment
on
the
waning
year
and
the
warmth
and
radiance
of
the
sun
would
vanish
behind
a
passing
cloud
about
the
greatcoat
he
did
not
tell
them
for
he
could
not
have
spoken
of
it
without
tears
iii
ansell
a
provincial
draper
of
moderate
prosperity
ought
by
rights
to
have
been
classed
not
with
the
cow
but
with
those
phenomena
that
are
not
really
there
but
his
son
with
pardonable
illogicality
excepted
him
he
never
suspected
that
his
father
might
be
the
subjective
product
of
a
diseased
imagination
from
his
earliest
years
he
had
taken
him
for
granted
as
a
most
undeniable
and
lovable
fact
to
be
born
one
thing
and
grow
up
another
ansell
had
accomplished
this
without
weakening
one
of
the
ties
that
bound
him
to
his
home
the
rooms
above
the
shop
still
seemed
as
comfortable
the
garden
behind
it
as
gracious
as
they
had
seemed
fifteen
years
before
when
he
would
sit
behind
miss
appleblossom
s
central
throne
and
she
like
some
allegorical
figure
would
send
the
change
and
receipted
bills
spinning
away
from
her
in
little
boxwood
balls
at
first
the
young
man
had
attributed
these
happy
relations
to
his
own
tact
but
in
time
he
perceived
that
the
tact
was
all
on
the
side
of
his
father
ansell
was
not
merely
a
man
of
some
education
he
had
what
no
education
can
bring
the
power
of
detecting
what
is
important
like
many
fathers
he
had
spared
no
expense
over
his
boy
he
had
borrowed
money
to
start
him
at
a
rapacious
and
fashionable
private
school
he
had
sent
him
to
tutors
he
had
sent
him
to
cambridge
but
he
knew
that
all
this
was
not
the
important
thing
the
important
thing
was
freedom
the
boy
must
use
his
education
as
he
chose
and
if
he
paid
his
father
back
it
would
certainly
not
be
in
his
own
coin
so
when
stewart
said
at
cambridge
can
i
read
for
the
moral
science
tripos
ansell
had
only
replied
this
philosophy
do
you
say
that
it
lies
behind
everything
yes
i
think
so
it
tries
to
discover
what
is
good
and
then
my
boy
you
had
better
read
as
much
of
it
as
you
and
a
year
later
i
d
like
to
take
up
this
philosophy
seriously
but
i
don
t
feel
why
not
because
it
brings
in
no
return
i
think
i
m
a
great
philosopher
but
then
all
philosophers
think
that
though
they
don
t
dare
to
say
so
but
however
great
i
am
i
shan
t
earn
money
perhaps
i
shan
t
ever
be
able
to
keep
myself
i
shan
t
even
get
a
good
social
position
you
ve
only
to
say
one
word
and
i
ll
work
for
the
civil
service
i
m
good
enough
to
get
in
ansell
liked
money
and
social
position
but
he
knew
that
there
is
a
more
important
thing
and
replied
you
must
take
up
this
philosophy
seriously
i
another
thing
there
are
the
there
is
enough
money
now
to
get
mary
and
maud
as
good
husbands
as
they
and
mary
and
maud
took
the
same
view
it
was
in
this
plebeian
household
that
rickie
spent
part
of
the
christmas
vacation
his
own
home
such
as
it
was
was
with
the
silts
needy
cousins
of
his
father
s
and
combined
to
a
peculiar
degree
the
restrictions
of
hospitality
with
the
discomforts
of
a
such
pleasure
as
he
had
outside
cambridge
was
in
the
homes
of
his
friends
and
it
was
a
particular
joy
and
honour
to
visit
ansell
who
though
as
free
from
social
snobbishness
as
most
of
us
will
ever
manage
to
be
was
rather
careful
when
he
drove
up
to
the
facade
of
his
shop
i
like
our
new
lettering
he
said
thoughtfully
the
words
stewart
ansell
were
repeated
again
and
again
along
the
high
street
curly
gold
letters
that
seemed
to
float
in
tanks
of
glazed
chocolate
rather
said
rickie
but
he
wondered
whether
one
of
the
bonds
that
kept
the
ansell
family
united
might
not
be
their
complete
absence
of
taste
a
surer
bond
by
far
than
the
identity
of
it
and
he
wondered
this
again
when
he
sat
at
tea
opposite
a
long
row
of
crayons
stewart
as
a
baby
stewart
as
a
small
boy
with
large
feet
stewart
as
a
larger
boy
with
smaller
feet
mary
reading
a
book
whose
leaves
were
as
thick
as
eiderdowns
and
yet
again
did
he
wonder
it
when
he
woke
with
a
gasp
in
the
night
to
find
a
harp
in
luminous
paint
throbbing
and
glowering
at
him
from
the
adjacent
wall
watch
and
pray
was
written
on
the
harp
and
until
rickie
hung
a
towel
over
it
the
exhortation
was
partially
successful
it
was
a
very
happy
visit
miss
appleblosssom
who
now
acted
as
housekeeper
had
met
him
before
during
her
expedition
to
cambridge
and
her
admiration
of
university
life
was
as
shrill
and
as
genuine
now
as
it
had
been
then
the
girls
at
first
were
a
little
aggressive
for
on
his
arrival
he
had
been
tired
and
maud
had
taken
it
for
haughtiness
and
said
he
was
looking
down
on
them
but
this
passed
they
did
not
fall
in
love
with
him
nor
he
with
them
but
a
morning
was
spent
very
pleasantly
in
in
the
back
garden
ansell
was
rather
different
to
what
he
was
in
cambridge
but
to
rickie
not
less
attractive
and
there
was
a
curious
charm
in
the
hum
of
the
shop
which
swelled
into
a
roar
if
one
opened
the
partition
door
on
a
listen
to
your
money
said
rickie
i
wish
i
could
hear
mine
i
wish
my
money
was
i
don
t
mine
s
dead
money
it
s
come
to
me
through
about
six
dead
people
getting
a
little
smaller
and
a
little
more
respectable
each
time
on
account
of
the
it
needed
to
get
why
did
your
people
too
once
keep
a
shop
oh
not
as
bad
as
that
they
only
swindled
about
a
hundred
years
ago
an
elliot
did
something
shady
and
founded
the
fortunes
of
our
i
never
knew
any
one
so
relentless
to
his
ancestors
you
make
up
for
your
soapiness
towards
the
you
d
be
relentless
if
you
d
heard
the
silts
as
i
have
talk
about
a
fortune
small
perhaps
but
unsoiled
by
trade
of
course
aunt
emily
is
rather
different
oh
goodness
me
i
ve
forgotten
my
aunt
she
lives
not
so
far
i
shall
have
to
call
on
accordingly
he
wrote
to
mrs
failing
and
said
he
should
like
to
pay
his
respects
he
told
her
about
the
ansells
and
so
worded
the
letter
that
she
might
reasonably
have
sent
an
invitation
to
his
friend
she
replied
that
she
was
looking
forward
to
their
you
mustn
t
go
round
by
the
trains
said
ansell
it
means
changing
at
salisbury
by
the
road
it
s
no
great
way
stewart
shall
drive
you
over
salisbury
plain
and
fetch
you
there
s
too
much
snow
said
ansell
then
the
girls
shall
take
you
in
their
that
i
will
said
maud
who
was
not
unwilling
to
see
the
inside
of
cadover
but
rickie
went
round
by
the
trains
we
have
all
missed
you
said
ansell
when
he
returned
there
is
a
general
feeling
that
you
are
no
nuisance
and
had
better
stop
till
the
end
of
the
this
he
could
not
do
he
was
bound
for
christmas
to
the
silts
as
a
real
guest
silt
had
written
underlining
the
word
real
twice
and
after
christmas
he
must
go
to
the
pembrokes
these
are
no
reasons
the
only
real
reason
for
doing
a
thing
is
because
you
want
to
do
it
i
think
the
talk
about
engagements
is
i
think
perhaps
it
is
said
rickie
but
he
went
never
had
the
turkey
been
so
athletic
or
the
tied
into
its
cloth
so
tightly
yet
he
knew
that
both
these
symbols
of
hilarity
had
cost
money
and
it
went
to
his
heart
when
silt
said
in
a
hungry
voice
have
you
thought
at
all
of
what
you
want
to
be
no
well
why
should
you
you
have
no
need
to
be
and
at
dessert
i
wonder
who
cadover
goes
to
i
expect
money
will
follow
money
it
always
it
was
with
a
guilty
feeling
of
relief
that
he
left
for
the
pembrokes
the
pembrokes
lived
in
an
adjacent
suburb
or
rather
sububurb
the
tract
called
sawston
celebrated
for
its
public
school
their
style
of
life
however
was
not
particularly
suburban
their
house
was
small
and
its
name
was
shelthorpe
but
it
had
an
air
about
it
which
suggested
a
certain
amount
of
money
and
a
certain
amount
of
taste
there
were
decent
in
the
madonnas
of
acknowledged
merit
hung
upon
the
stairs
a
replica
of
the
hermes
of
praxiteles
of
course
only
the
bust
stood
in
the
hall
with
a
real
palm
behind
it
agnes
in
her
way
was
a
good
housekeeper
and
kept
the
pretty
things
well
dusted
it
was
she
who
insisted
on
the
strip
of
brown
holland
that
led
diagonally
from
the
front
door
to
the
door
of
herbert
s
study
boys
grubby
feet
should
not
go
treading
on
her
indian
square
it
was
she
who
always
cleaned
the
and
washed
the
bust
and
the
leaves
of
the
palm
in
short
if
a
house
could
speak
and
sometimes
it
does
speak
more
clearly
than
the
people
who
live
in
it
the
house
of
the
pembrokes
would
have
said
i
am
not
quite
like
other
houses
yet
i
am
perfectly
comfortable
i
contain
works
of
art
and
a
microscope
and
books
but
i
do
not
live
for
any
of
these
things
or
suffer
them
to
disarrange
me
i
live
for
myself
and
for
the
greater
houses
that
shall
come
after
me
yet
in
me
neither
the
cry
of
money
nor
the
cry
for
money
shall
ever
be
pembroke
was
at
the
station
he
did
better
as
a
host
than
as
a
guest
and
welcomed
the
young
man
with
real
friendliness
we
were
all
coming
but
gerald
has
strained
his
ankle
slightly
and
wants
to
keep
quiet
as
he
is
playing
next
week
in
a
match
and
needless
to
say
that
explains
the
absence
of
my
gerald
dawes
yes
he
s
with
us
i
m
so
glad
you
ll
meet
so
am
i
said
rickie
with
extreme
awkwardness
does
he
remember
me
vivid
also
was
rickie
s
remembrance
of
him
a
splendid
fellow
asserted
pembroke
i
hope
that
agnes
is
thank
you
yes
she
is
well
and
i
think
you
re
looking
more
like
other
people
i
ve
been
having
a
very
good
time
with
a
indeed
that
s
right
who
was
that
rickie
had
a
young
man
s
reticence
he
generally
spoke
of
a
friend
a
person
i
know
a
place
i
was
when
the
book
of
life
is
opening
our
readings
are
secret
and
we
are
unwilling
to
give
chapter
and
verse
pembroke
who
was
half
way
through
the
volume
and
had
skipped
or
forgotten
the
earlier
pages
could
not
understand
rickie
s
hesitation
nor
why
with
such
awkwardness
he
should
pronounce
the
harmless
dissyllable
ansell
wasn
t
that
the
pleasant
fellow
who
asked
us
to
lunch
no
that
was
anderson
who
keeps
below
you
didn
t
see
ansell
the
ones
who
came
to
breakfast
were
tilliard
and
of
course
and
since
then
you
have
been
with
the
silts
how
are
they
very
well
thank
you
they
want
to
be
remembered
to
the
pembrokes
had
formerly
lived
near
the
elliots
and
had
shown
great
kindness
to
rickie
when
his
parents
died
they
were
thus
rather
in
the
position
of
family
friends
please
remember
us
when
you
he
added
almost
roguishly
the
silts
are
kindness
itself
all
the
same
it
must
be
just
a
little
dull
we
thought
and
we
thought
that
you
might
like
a
change
and
of
course
we
are
delighted
to
have
you
besides
that
goes
without
it
s
very
good
of
you
said
rickie
who
had
accepted
the
invitation
because
he
felt
he
ought
to
not
a
bit
and
you
mustn
t
expect
us
to
be
otherwise
than
quiet
on
the
holidays
there
is
a
library
of
a
sort
as
you
know
and
you
will
find
gerald
a
splendid
will
they
be
married
soon
oh
no
whispered
pembroke
shutting
his
eyes
as
if
rickie
had
made
some
terrible
faux
pas
it
will
be
a
very
long
engagement
he
must
make
his
way
first
i
have
seen
such
endless
misery
result
from
people
marrying
before
they
have
made
their
yes
that
is
so
said
rickie
despondently
thinking
of
the
silts
it
s
a
sad
unpalatable
truth
said
pembroke
thinking
that
the
despondency
might
be
personal
but
one
must
accept
it
my
sister
and
gerald
i
am
thankful
to
say
have
accepted
it
though
naturally
it
has
been
a
little
their
cab
lurched
round
the
corner
as
he
spoke
and
the
two
patients
came
in
sight
agnes
was
leaning
over
the
creosoted
and
behind
her
there
stood
a
young
man
who
had
the
figure
of
a
greek
athlete
and
the
face
of
an
english
one
he
was
fair
and
cleanshaven
and
his
colourless
hair
was
cut
rather
short
the
sun
was
in
his
eyes
and
they
like
his
mouth
seemed
scarcely
more
than
slits
in
his
healthy
skin
just
where
he
began
to
be
beautiful
the
clothes
started
round
his
neck
went
an
collar
and
a
tie
and
the
rest
of
his
limbs
were
hidden
by
a
grey
lounge
suit
carefully
creased
in
the
right
places
lovely
lovely
cried
agnes
banging
on
the
gate
your
train
must
have
been
to
the
hullo
said
the
athlete
and
vomited
with
the
greeting
a
cloud
of
it
must
have
been
imprisoned
in
his
mouth
some
time
for
no
pipe
was
visible
hullo
returned
rickie
laughing
violently
they
shook
hands
where
are
you
going
rickie
asked
agnes
you
aren
t
grubby
why
don
t
you
stop
gerald
get
the
large
herbert
has
letters
but
we
can
sit
here
till
lunch
it
s
like
the
garden
of
shelthorpe
was
nearly
all
in
front
an
unusual
and
pleasant
arrangement
the
front
gate
and
the
servants
entrance
were
both
at
the
side
and
in
the
remaining
space
the
gardener
had
contrived
a
little
lawn
where
one
could
sit
concealed
from
the
road
by
a
fence
from
the
neighbour
by
a
fence
from
the
house
by
a
tree
and
from
the
path
by
a
bush
this
is
the
lovers
bower
observed
agnes
sitting
down
on
the
bench
rickie
stood
by
her
till
the
chair
arrived
are
you
smoking
before
lunch
asked
dawes
no
thank
you
i
hardly
ever
no
vices
aren
t
you
at
cambridge
now
what
s
your
college
rickie
told
him
do
you
know
carruthers
rather
i
mean
carruthers
who
got
his
socker
rather
he
s
secretary
to
the
college
musical
a
carruthers
dawes
seemed
offended
he
tapped
on
his
teeth
and
remarked
that
the
weather
bad
no
business
to
be
so
warm
in
winter
but
it
was
fiendish
before
christmas
said
agnes
he
frowned
and
asked
do
you
know
a
man
called
gerrish
do
you
know
james
never
heard
of
he
s
my
year
too
he
got
a
blue
for
hockey
his
second
i
know
nothing
about
the
rickie
winced
at
the
abbreviation
it
was
at
that
time
the
proper
thing
to
speak
of
the
i
haven
t
the
time
pursued
dawes
no
no
said
rickie
politely
i
had
the
chance
of
being
an
undergrad
myself
and
by
jove
i
m
thankful
i
didn
t
why
asked
agnes
for
there
was
a
pause
puts
you
back
in
your
profession
men
who
go
there
first
before
the
army
start
hopelessly
behind
the
same
with
the
stock
exchange
or
painting
i
know
men
in
both
and
they
ve
never
caught
up
the
time
they
lost
in
the
varsity
unless
of
course
you
turn
i
love
cambridge
said
she
all
those
glorious
buildings
and
every
one
so
happy
and
running
in
and
out
of
each
other
s
rooms
all
day
that
might
make
an
undergrad
happy
but
i
beg
leave
to
state
it
wouldn
t
me
i
haven
t
four
years
to
throw
away
for
the
sake
of
being
called
a
varsity
man
and
hobnobbing
with
rickie
was
prepared
to
find
his
old
schoolfellow
ungrammatical
and
bumptious
but
he
was
not
prepared
to
find
him
peevish
athletes
he
believed
were
simple
straightforward
people
cruel
and
brutal
if
you
like
but
never
petty
they
knocked
you
down
and
hurt
you
and
then
went
on
their
way
rejoicing
for
this
rickie
thought
there
is
something
to
be
said
he
had
escaped
the
sin
of
despising
the
physically
strong
a
sin
against
which
the
physically
weak
must
guard
but
here
was
dawes
returning
again
and
again
to
the
subject
of
the
university
full
of
transparent
jealousy
and
petty
spite
nagging
nagging
nagging
like
a
maiden
lady
who
has
not
been
invited
to
a
rickie
wondered
whether
after
all
ansell
and
the
extremists
might
not
be
right
and
bodily
beauty
and
strength
be
signs
of
the
soul
s
damnation
he
glanced
at
agnes
she
was
writing
down
some
orderings
for
the
tradespeople
on
a
piece
of
paper
her
handsome
face
was
intent
on
the
work
the
bench
on
which
she
and
gerald
were
sitting
had
no
back
but
she
sat
as
straight
as
a
dart
he
though
strong
enough
to
sit
straight
did
not
take
the
trouble
why
don
t
they
talk
to
each
other
thought
rickie
gerald
give
this
paper
to
the
i
can
give
it
to
the
other
slavey
can
t
i
she
d
be
well
there
s
he
s
busy
oh
you
know
where
the
kitchen
is
take
it
to
the
he
disappeared
slowly
behind
the
tree
what
do
you
think
of
him
she
immediately
asked
he
murmured
civilly
has
he
changed
since
he
was
a
schoolboy
in
a
do
tell
me
all
about
him
why
won
t
you
she
might
have
seen
a
flash
of
horror
pass
over
rickie
s
face
the
horror
disappeared
for
thank
god
he
was
now
a
man
whom
civilization
protects
but
he
and
gerald
had
met
as
it
were
behind
the
scenes
before
our
decorous
drama
opens
and
there
the
elder
boy
had
done
things
to
him
absurd
things
not
worth
chronicling
separately
an
bed
is
nothing
pinches
kicks
boxed
ears
twisted
arms
pulled
hair
ghosts
at
night
inky
books
befouled
photographs
amount
to
very
little
by
themselves
but
let
them
be
united
and
continuous
and
you
have
a
hell
that
no
devil
can
devise
between
rickie
and
gerald
there
lay
a
shadow
that
darkens
life
more
often
than
we
suppose
the
bully
and
his
victim
never
quite
forget
their
first
relations
they
meet
in
clubs
and
country
houses
and
clap
one
another
on
the
back
but
in
both
the
memory
is
green
of
a
more
strenuous
day
when
they
were
boys
together
he
tried
to
say
he
was
the
right
kind
of
boy
and
i
was
the
wrong
but
cambridge
would
not
let
him
smooth
the
situation
over
by
if
he
had
been
the
wrong
kind
of
boy
gerald
had
been
a
worse
kind
he
murmured
we
are
different
very
and
miss
pembroke
perhaps
suspecting
something
asked
no
more
but
she
kept
to
the
subject
of
dawes
humorously
depreciating
her
lover
and
discussing
him
without
reverence
rickie
laughed
but
felt
uncomfortable
when
people
were
engaged
he
felt
that
they
should
be
outside
criticism
yet
here
he
was
criticizing
he
could
not
help
it
he
was
dragged
in
i
hope
his
ankle
is
never
was
bad
he
s
always
fussing
over
he
plays
next
week
in
a
match
i
think
herbert
i
dare
say
he
shall
we
be
going
pray
go
if
you
like
i
shall
stop
at
home
i
ve
had
enough
of
cold
it
was
all
very
colourless
and
odd
gerald
returned
saying
i
can
t
stand
your
cook
what
s
she
want
to
ask
me
questions
for
i
can
t
stand
talking
to
servants
i
say
if
i
speak
to
you
well
and
good
and
it
s
another
thing
besides
if
she
were
well
i
hope
our
ugly
cook
will
have
lunch
ready
in
a
minute
said
agnes
we
re
frightfully
unpunctual
this
morning
and
i
daren
t
say
anything
because
it
was
the
same
yesterday
and
if
i
complain
again
they
might
leave
poor
rickie
must
be
why
the
silts
gave
me
all
these
sandwiches
and
i
ve
never
eaten
them
they
always
stuff
and
you
thought
you
d
better
eh
said
dawes
in
case
you
weren
t
stuffed
miss
pembroke
who
somewhat
economically
looked
annoyed
the
voice
of
pembroke
was
now
heard
calling
from
the
house
frederick
frederick
my
dear
boy
pardon
me
it
was
an
important
letter
about
the
church
defence
otherwise
come
in
and
see
your
he
was
glad
to
quit
the
little
lawn
he
had
learnt
too
much
there
it
was
dreadful
they
did
not
love
each
other
more
dreadful
even
than
the
case
of
his
father
and
mother
for
they
until
they
married
had
got
on
pretty
well
but
this
man
was
already
rude
and
brutal
and
cold
he
was
still
the
school
bully
who
twisted
up
the
arms
of
little
boys
and
ran
pins
into
them
at
chapel
and
struck
them
in
the
stomach
when
they
were
swinging
on
the
horizontal
bar
poor
agnes
why
ever
had
she
done
it
ought
not
somebody
to
interfere
he
had
forgotten
his
sandwiches
and
went
back
to
get
them
gerald
and
agnes
were
locked
in
each
other
s
arms
he
only
looked
for
a
moment
but
the
sight
burnt
into
his
brain
the
man
s
grip
was
the
stronger
he
had
drawn
the
woman
on
to
his
knee
was
pressing
her
with
all
his
strength
against
him
already
her
hands
slipped
off
him
and
she
whispered
don
t
you
hurt
her
face
had
no
expression
it
stared
at
the
intruder
and
never
saw
him
then
her
lover
kissed
it
and
immediately
it
shone
with
mysterious
beauty
like
some
star
rickie
limped
away
without
the
sandwiches
crimson
and
afraid
he
thought
do
such
things
actually
happen
and
he
seemed
to
be
looking
down
coloured
valleys
brighter
they
glowed
till
gods
of
pure
flame
were
born
in
them
and
then
he
was
looking
at
pinnacles
of
virgin
snow
while
pembroke
talked
the
riot
of
fair
images
increased
they
invaded
his
being
and
lit
lamps
at
unsuspected
shrines
their
orchestra
commenced
in
that
suburban
house
where
he
had
to
stand
aside
for
the
maid
to
carry
in
the
luncheon
music
flowed
past
him
like
a
river
he
stood
at
the
springs
of
creation
and
heard
the
primeval
monotony
then
an
obscure
instrument
gave
out
a
little
phrase
the
river
continued
unheeding
the
phrase
was
repeated
and
a
listener
might
know
it
was
a
fragment
of
the
tune
of
tunes
nobler
instruments
accepted
it
the
clarionet
protected
the
brass
encouraged
and
it
rose
to
the
surface
to
the
whisper
of
violins
in
full
unison
was
love
born
flame
of
the
flame
flushing
the
dark
river
beneath
him
and
the
virgin
snows
above
his
wings
were
infinite
his
youth
eternal
the
sun
was
a
jewel
on
his
finger
as
he
passed
it
in
benediction
over
the
world
creation
no
longer
monotonous
acclaimed
him
in
widening
melody
in
brighter
radiances
was
love
a
column
of
fire
was
he
a
torrent
of
song
was
he
greater
than
either
the
touch
of
a
man
on
a
woman
it
was
the
merest
accident
that
rickie
had
not
been
disgusted
but
this
he
could
not
know
pembroke
when
he
called
the
two
dawdlers
into
lunch
was
aware
of
a
hand
on
his
arm
and
a
voice
that
murmured
don
t
they
may
be
he
stared
and
struck
the
gong
to
its
music
they
approached
priest
and
high
priestess
rickie
can
i
give
these
sandwiches
to
the
boot
boy
said
the
one
he
would
love
the
gong
be
quick
the
gong
are
you
smoking
before
lunch
said
the
other
but
they
had
got
into
heaven
and
nothing
could
get
them
out
of
it
others
might
think
them
surly
or
prosaic
he
knew
he
could
remember
every
word
they
spoke
he
would
treasure
every
motion
every
glance
of
either
and
so
in
time
to
come
when
the
gates
of
heaven
had
shut
some
faint
radiance
some
echo
of
wisdom
might
remain
with
him
outside
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
saw
them
very
little
during
his
visit
he
checked
himself
because
he
was
unworthy
what
right
had
he
to
pry
even
in
the
spirit
upon
their
bliss
it
was
no
crime
to
have
seen
them
on
the
lawn
it
would
be
a
crime
to
go
to
it
again
he
tried
to
keep
himself
and
his
thoughts
away
not
because
he
was
ascetic
but
because
they
would
not
like
it
if
they
knew
this
behaviour
of
his
suited
them
admirably
and
when
any
gracious
little
thing
occurred
to
them
any
little
thing
that
his
sympathy
had
contrived
and
allowed
they
put
it
down
to
chance
or
to
each
other
so
the
lovers
fall
into
the
background
they
are
part
of
the
distant
sunrise
and
only
the
mountains
speak
to
them
rickie
talks
to
pembroke
amidst
the
unlit
valleys
of
our
world
iv
sawston
school
had
been
founded
by
a
tradesman
in
the
seventeenth
century
it
was
then
a
tiny
in
a
tiny
town
and
the
city
company
who
governed
it
had
to
drive
half
a
day
through
the
woods
and
heath
on
the
occasion
of
their
annual
visit
in
the
twentieth
century
they
still
drove
but
only
from
the
railway
station
and
found
themselves
not
in
a
tiny
town
nor
yet
in
a
large
one
but
amongst
innumerable
residences
detached
and
which
had
gathered
round
the
school
for
the
intentions
of
the
founder
had
been
altered
or
at
all
events
amplified
instead
of
educating
the
poore
of
my
home
he
now
educated
the
upper
classes
of
england
the
change
had
taken
place
not
so
very
far
back
till
the
nineteenth
century
the
was
still
composed
of
day
scholars
from
the
neighbourhood
then
two
things
happened
firstly
the
school
s
property
rose
in
value
and
it
became
rich
secondly
for
no
obvious
reason
it
suddenly
emitted
a
quantity
of
bishops
the
bishops
like
the
stars
from
a
roman
candle
were
all
colours
and
flew
in
all
directions
some
high
some
low
some
to
distant
colonies
one
into
the
church
of
rome
but
many
a
father
traced
their
course
in
the
papers
many
a
mother
wondered
whether
her
son
if
properly
ignited
might
not
burn
as
bright
many
a
family
moved
to
the
place
where
living
and
education
were
so
cheap
where
were
not
looked
down
upon
and
where
the
orthodox
and
the
were
said
to
be
combined
the
school
doubled
its
numbers
it
built
new
laboratories
and
a
gymnasium
it
dropped
the
prefix
it
coaxed
the
sons
of
the
local
tradesmen
into
a
new
foundation
the
commercial
school
built
a
couple
of
miles
away
and
it
started
it
had
not
the
gracious
antiquity
of
eton
or
winchester
nor
on
the
other
hand
had
it
a
conscious
policy
like
lancing
wellington
and
other
purely
modern
foundations
where
tradition
served
it
clung
to
them
where
new
departures
seemed
desirable
they
were
made
it
aimed
at
producing
the
average
englishman
and
to
a
very
great
extent
it
succeeded
here
pembroke
passed
his
happy
and
industrious
life
his
technical
position
was
that
of
master
to
a
form
low
down
on
the
modern
side
but
his
work
lay
elsewhere
he
organized
if
no
organization
existed
he
would
create
one
if
one
did
exist
he
would
modify
it
an
organization
he
would
say
is
after
all
not
an
end
in
itself
it
must
contribute
to
a
when
one
good
custom
seemed
likely
to
corrupt
the
school
he
was
ready
with
another
he
believed
that
without
innumerable
customs
there
was
no
safety
either
for
boys
or
men
perhaps
he
is
right
and
always
will
be
right
perhaps
each
of
us
would
go
to
ruin
if
for
one
short
hour
we
acted
as
we
thought
fit
and
attempted
the
service
of
perfect
freedom
the
school
caps
with
their
elaborate
symbolism
were
his
his
the
that
showed
how
far
a
boy
could
swim
his
the
hierarchy
of
jerseys
and
blazers
it
was
he
who
instituted
bounds
and
call
and
the
two
sorts
of
and
the
three
sorts
of
caning
and
the
sawtonian
a
magazine
his
plump
finger
was
in
every
pie
the
dome
of
his
skull
mild
but
impressive
shone
at
every
master
s
meeting
he
was
generally
acknowledged
to
be
the
coming
man
his
last
achievement
had
been
the
organization
of
the
they
had
been
left
too
much
to
themselves
and
were
weak
in
esprit
de
corps
they
were
apt
to
regard
home
not
school
as
the
most
important
thing
in
their
lives
moreover
they
got
out
of
their
parents
hands
they
did
their
preparation
any
time
and
some
times
anyhow
they
shirked
games
they
were
out
at
all
hours
they
ate
what
they
should
not
they
smoked
they
bicycled
on
the
asphalt
now
all
was
over
like
boarders
they
were
to
be
in
at
and
were
not
allowed
out
after
unless
with
a
written
order
from
their
parent
or
guardian
they
too
must
work
at
fixed
hours
in
the
evening
and
before
breakfast
next
morning
from
to
games
were
compulsory
they
must
not
go
to
parties
in
term
time
they
must
keep
to
bounds
of
course
the
reform
was
not
complete
it
was
impossible
to
control
the
dieting
though
on
a
printed
circular
were
implored
to
provide
simple
food
and
it
is
also
believed
that
some
mothers
disobeyed
the
rule
about
preparation
and
allowed
their
sons
to
do
all
the
work
and
have
a
longer
sleep
in
the
morning
but
the
gulf
between
and
boarders
was
considerably
lessened
and
grew
still
narrower
when
the
too
were
organized
into
a
house
with
and
colours
of
their
own
through
the
house
said
pembroke
one
learns
patriotism
for
the
school
just
as
through
the
school
one
learns
patriotism
for
the
country
our
only
course
therefore
is
to
organize
the
into
a
the
headmaster
agreed
as
he
often
did
and
the
new
community
was
formed
pembroke
to
avoid
the
tongues
of
malice
had
refused
the
post
of
for
himself
saying
to
jackson
who
taught
the
sixth
you
keep
too
much
in
the
background
here
is
a
chance
for
but
this
was
a
failure
jackson
a
scholar
and
a
student
neither
felt
nor
conveyed
any
enthusiasm
and
when
confronted
with
his
house
would
say
well
i
don
t
know
what
we
re
all
here
for
now
i
should
think
you
d
better
go
home
to
your
he
returned
to
his
background
and
next
term
pembroke
was
to
take
his
place
such
were
the
themes
on
which
pembroke
discoursed
to
rickie
s
civil
ear
he
showed
him
the
school
and
the
library
and
the
subterranean
hall
where
the
might
leave
their
coats
and
caps
and
where
on
festal
occasions
they
supped
he
showed
him
jackson
s
pretty
house
and
whispered
were
it
not
for
his
brilliant
intellect
it
would
be
a
case
of
quickmarch
he
showed
him
the
happily
completed
and
the
chapel
unhappily
still
in
need
of
funds
rickie
was
impressed
but
then
he
was
impressed
by
everything
of
course
a
house
of
seemed
a
little
shadowy
after
agnes
and
gerald
but
he
imparted
some
reality
even
to
that
the
said
pembroke
is
most
gratifying
we
never
expected
to
manage
it
this
year
but
before
the
easter
holidays
every
boy
received
a
subscription
card
and
was
given
to
understand
that
he
must
collect
thirty
shillings
you
will
scarcely
believe
me
but
they
nearly
all
responded
next
term
there
was
a
dinner
in
the
great
school
and
all
who
had
collected
not
thirty
shillings
but
as
much
as
a
pound
were
invited
to
it
for
naturally
one
was
not
precise
for
a
few
shillings
the
response
being
the
really
valuable
thing
practically
the
whole
school
had
to
they
must
enjoy
the
court
ah
it
isn
t
used
very
much
racquets
as
i
daresay
you
know
is
rather
an
expensive
game
only
the
wealthier
boys
play
and
i
m
sorry
to
say
that
it
is
not
of
our
wealthier
boys
that
we
are
always
the
proudest
but
the
point
is
that
no
public
school
can
be
called
until
it
has
one
they
are
building
them
right
and
and
now
you
must
finish
the
chapel
now
we
must
complete
the
he
paused
reverently
and
said
and
here
is
a
fragment
of
the
original
rickie
at
once
had
a
rush
of
sympathy
he
too
looked
with
reverence
at
the
morsel
of
jacobean
brickwork
ruddy
and
beautiful
amidst
the
stones
of
the
modern
apse
the
two
men
who
had
so
little
in
common
were
thrilled
with
patriotism
they
rejoiced
that
their
country
was
great
noble
and
old
thank
god
i
m
english
said
rickie
suddenly
thank
him
indeed
said
pembroke
laying
a
hand
on
his
back
we
ve
been
nearly
as
great
as
the
greeks
i
do
believe
greater
i
m
sure
than
the
italians
though
they
did
get
closer
to
beauty
greater
than
the
french
though
we
do
take
all
their
ideas
i
can
t
help
thinking
that
england
is
immense
english
literature
pembroke
removed
his
hand
he
found
such
patriotism
somewhat
craven
genuine
patriotism
comes
only
from
the
heart
it
knows
no
parleying
with
reason
english
ladies
will
declare
abroad
that
there
are
no
fogs
in
london
and
pembroke
though
he
would
not
go
to
this
was
only
restrained
by
the
certainty
of
being
found
out
on
this
occasion
he
remarked
that
the
greeks
lacked
spiritual
insight
and
had
a
low
conception
of
woman
as
to
women
oh
there
they
were
dreadful
said
rickie
leaning
his
hand
on
the
chapel
i
realize
that
more
and
more
but
as
to
spiritual
insight
i
don
t
quite
like
to
say
and
i
find
plato
too
difficult
but
i
know
men
who
don
t
and
i
fancy
they
mightn
t
agree
with
far
be
it
from
me
to
disparage
plato
and
for
philosophy
as
a
whole
i
have
the
greatest
respect
but
it
is
the
crown
of
a
man
s
education
not
the
foundation
myself
i
read
it
with
the
utmost
profit
but
i
have
known
endless
trouble
result
from
boys
who
attempt
it
too
soon
before
they
were
but
if
those
boys
had
died
first
cried
rickie
with
sudden
vehemence
without
knowing
what
there
is
to
know
or
isn
t
to
know
said
pembroke
sarcastically
or
what
there
isn
t
to
know
exactly
that
s
my
dear
rickie
what
do
you
mean
if
an
old
friend
may
be
frank
you
are
talking
great
and
with
a
few
formulae
he
propped
up
the
young
man
s
orthodoxy
the
props
were
unnecessary
rickie
had
his
own
equilibrium
neither
the
revivalism
that
assails
a
boy
at
about
the
age
of
fifteen
nor
the
scepticism
that
meets
him
five
years
later
could
sway
him
from
his
allegiance
to
the
church
into
which
he
had
been
born
but
his
equilibrium
was
personal
and
the
secret
of
it
useless
to
others
he
desired
that
each
man
should
find
his
own
what
does
philosophy
do
the
propper
continued
does
it
make
a
man
happier
in
life
does
it
make
him
die
more
peacefully
i
fancy
that
in
the
herbert
spencer
will
get
no
further
than
the
rest
of
us
ah
rickie
i
wish
you
could
move
among
the
school
boys
and
see
their
healthy
contempt
for
all
they
can
not
touch
here
he
was
going
too
far
and
had
to
add
their
spiritual
capacities
of
course
are
another
then
he
remembered
the
greeks
and
said
which
proves
my
original
submissive
signs
as
of
one
propped
appeared
in
rickie
s
face
pembroke
then
questioned
him
about
the
men
who
found
plato
not
difficult
but
here
he
kept
silence
patting
the
school
chapel
gently
and
presently
the
conversation
turned
to
topics
with
which
they
were
both
more
competent
to
deal
does
agnes
take
much
interest
in
the
school
not
as
much
as
she
did
it
is
the
result
of
her
engagement
if
our
naughty
soldier
had
not
carried
her
off
she
might
have
made
an
ideal
schoolmaster
s
wife
i
often
chaff
him
about
it
for
he
a
little
despises
the
intellectual
professions
natural
perfectly
natural
how
can
a
man
who
faces
death
feel
as
we
do
towards
mensa
or
tupto
perfectly
true
absolutely
pembroke
remarked
to
himself
that
frederick
was
improving
if
a
man
shoots
straight
and
hits
straight
and
speaks
straight
if
his
heart
is
in
the
right
place
if
he
has
the
instincts
of
a
christian
and
a
gentleman
then
i
at
all
events
ask
no
better
husband
for
my
how
could
you
get
a
better
he
cried
do
you
remember
the
thing
in
the
clouds
and
he
quoted
as
well
as
he
could
from
the
invitation
of
the
dikaios
logos
the
description
of
the
young
athenian
perfect
in
body
placid
in
mind
who
neglects
his
work
at
the
bar
and
trains
all
day
among
the
woods
and
meadows
with
a
garland
on
his
head
and
a
friend
to
set
the
pace
the
scent
of
new
leaves
is
upon
them
they
rejoice
in
the
freshness
of
spring
over
their
heads
the
whispers
to
the
elm
perhaps
the
most
glorious
invitation
to
the
brainless
life
that
has
ever
been
given
yes
yes
said
pembroke
who
did
not
want
a
out
of
aristophanes
nor
had
he
got
one
for
dawes
would
not
have
bothered
over
the
garland
or
noticed
the
spring
and
would
have
complained
that
the
friend
ran
too
slowly
or
too
fast
and
as
for
her
but
he
could
think
of
no
classical
parallel
for
agnes
she
slipped
between
examples
a
kindly
medea
a
cleopatra
with
a
sense
of
duty
these
suggested
her
a
little
she
was
not
born
in
greece
but
came
overseas
to
it
a
dark
intelligent
princess
with
all
her
splendour
there
were
hints
of
splendour
still
hidden
hints
of
an
older
richer
and
more
mysterious
land
he
smiled
at
the
idea
of
her
being
not
ansell
clever
as
he
was
had
made
a
bad
blunder
she
had
more
reality
than
any
other
woman
in
the
world
pembroke
looked
pleased
at
this
boyish
enthusiasm
he
was
fond
of
his
sister
though
he
knew
her
to
be
full
of
faults
yes
i
envy
her
he
said
she
has
found
a
worthy
helpmeet
for
life
s
journey
i
do
believe
and
though
they
chafe
at
the
long
engagement
it
is
a
blessing
in
disguise
they
learn
to
know
each
other
thoroughly
before
contracting
more
intimate
rickie
did
not
assent
the
length
of
the
engagement
seemed
to
him
unspeakably
cruel
here
were
two
people
who
loved
each
other
and
they
could
not
marry
for
years
because
they
had
no
beastly
money
not
all
herbert
s
pious
skill
could
make
this
out
a
blessing
it
was
bad
enough
being
so
rich
at
the
silts
here
he
was
more
ashamed
of
it
than
ever
in
a
few
weeks
he
would
come
of
age
and
his
money
be
his
own
what
a
pity
things
were
so
crookedly
arranged
he
did
not
want
money
or
at
all
events
he
did
not
want
so
much
suppose
he
meditated
for
he
became
much
worried
over
this
suppose
i
had
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
less
than
i
shall
have
well
i
should
still
have
enough
i
don
t
want
anything
but
food
lodging
clothes
and
now
and
then
a
railway
fare
i
haven
t
any
tastes
i
don
t
collect
anything
or
play
games
books
are
nice
to
have
but
after
all
there
is
mudie
s
or
if
it
comes
to
that
the
free
library
oh
my
profession
i
forgot
i
shall
have
a
profession
well
that
will
leave
me
with
more
to
spare
than
and
he
supposed
away
till
he
lost
touch
with
the
world
and
with
what
it
permits
and
committed
an
unpardonable
sin
it
happened
towards
the
end
of
his
visit
another
airless
day
of
that
mild
january
dawes
was
playing
against
a
scratch
team
of
cads
and
had
to
go
down
to
the
ground
in
the
morning
to
settle
something
rickie
proposed
to
come
too
hitherto
he
had
been
no
nuisance
you
will
be
frightfully
bored
said
agnes
observing
the
cloud
on
her
lover
s
face
and
gerald
walks
like
a
i
had
a
little
thought
of
the
museum
this
morning
said
pembroke
it
is
very
strong
in
flint
ah
that
s
your
line
rickie
i
do
envy
you
and
herbert
the
way
you
enjoy
the
i
almost
think
i
ll
go
with
dawes
if
he
ll
have
me
i
can
walk
quite
fast
just
to
the
ground
and
back
arrowheads
are
wonderful
but
i
don
t
really
enjoy
them
yet
though
i
hope
i
shall
in
pembroke
was
offended
but
rickie
held
firm
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
was
back
at
the
house
alone
nearly
crying
oh
did
the
wretch
go
too
fast
called
miss
pembroke
from
her
bedroom
window
i
went
too
fast
for
he
spoke
quite
sharply
and
before
he
had
time
to
say
he
was
sorry
and
didn
t
mean
exactly
that
the
window
had
shut
they
ve
quarrelled
she
thought
whatever
about
she
soon
heard
gerald
returned
in
a
cold
stormy
temper
rickie
had
offered
him
money
my
dear
fellow
don
t
be
so
cross
the
child
s
if
it
was
i
d
forgive
that
but
i
can
t
stand
now
gerald
that
s
where
i
hate
you
you
don
t
know
what
it
is
to
pity
the
woman
s
job
so
you
wish
i
d
taken
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
from
him
did
you
ever
hear
such
blasted
cheek
marry
us
he
you
and
me
a
hundred
pounds
down
and
as
much
annual
he
of
course
to
pry
into
all
we
did
and
we
to
kowtow
and
eat
to
him
if
that
s
rickety
elliot
s
idea
of
a
soldier
and
an
englishman
it
isn
t
mine
and
i
wish
i
d
had
a
she
was
roaring
with
laughter
you
re
babies
a
pair
of
you
and
you
re
the
worst
why
couldn
t
you
let
the
little
silly
down
gently
there
he
was
puffing
and
sniffing
under
my
window
and
i
thought
he
d
insulted
you
why
didn
t
you
accept
accept
he
thundered
it
would
have
taken
the
nonsense
out
of
him
for
ever
why
he
was
only
talking
out
of
a
more
fool
well
don
t
be
angry
with
a
fool
he
means
no
harm
he
muddles
all
day
with
poetry
and
old
dead
people
and
then
tries
to
bring
it
into
life
it
s
too
funny
for
gerald
repeated
that
he
could
not
stand
unhealthiness
i
don
t
call
that
exactly
i
do
and
why
he
could
give
the
money
s
what
do
you
mean
he
became
shy
i
hadn
t
meant
to
tell
you
it
s
not
quite
for
a
for
like
most
men
who
are
rather
animal
he
was
intellectually
a
prude
he
says
he
can
t
ever
marry
owing
to
his
foot
it
wouldn
t
be
fair
to
posterity
his
grandfather
was
crocked
his
father
too
and
he
s
as
bad
he
thinks
that
it
s
hereditary
and
may
get
worse
next
generation
he
s
discussed
it
all
over
with
other
undergrads
a
bright
lot
they
must
be
he
daren
t
risk
having
any
children
hence
the
hundred
she
stopped
laughing
oh
little
beast
if
he
said
all
that
he
was
encouraged
to
proceed
hitherto
he
had
not
talked
about
their
school
days
now
he
told
her
everything
the
as
he
called
it
the
pins
in
chapel
and
how
one
afternoon
he
had
tied
him
on
to
a
tree
trunk
and
then
ran
away
of
course
only
for
a
moment
for
this
she
scolded
him
well
but
she
had
a
thrill
of
joy
when
she
thought
of
the
weak
boy
in
the
clutches
of
the
strong
one
v
gerald
died
that
afternoon
he
was
broken
up
in
the
football
match
rickie
and
pembroke
were
on
the
ground
when
the
accident
took
place
it
was
no
good
torturing
him
by
a
drive
to
the
hospital
and
he
was
merely
carried
to
the
little
pavilion
and
laid
upon
the
floor
a
doctor
came
and
so
did
a
clergyman
but
it
seemed
better
to
leave
him
for
the
last
few
minutes
with
agnes
who
had
ridden
down
on
her
bicycle
it
was
a
strange
lamentable
interview
the
girl
was
so
accustomed
to
health
that
for
a
time
she
could
not
understand
it
must
be
a
joke
that
he
chose
to
lie
there
in
the
dust
with
a
rug
over
him
and
his
knees
bent
up
towards
his
chin
his
arms
were
as
she
knew
them
and
their
admirable
muscles
showed
clear
and
clean
beneath
the
jersey
the
face
too
though
a
little
flushed
was
uninjured
it
must
be
some
curious
joke
gerald
what
have
you
been
doing
he
replied
i
can
t
see
you
it
s
too
oh
i
ll
soon
alter
that
she
said
in
her
old
brisk
way
she
opened
the
pavilion
door
the
people
who
were
standing
by
it
moved
aside
she
saw
a
deserted
meadow
steaming
and
grey
and
beyond
it
slateroofed
cottages
row
beside
row
climbing
a
shapeless
hill
towards
london
the
sky
was
yellow
there
that
s
she
sat
down
by
him
again
and
drew
his
hand
into
her
own
now
we
are
all
right
aren
t
we
where
are
you
this
time
she
could
not
reply
what
is
it
where
am
i
going
wasn
t
the
rector
here
said
she
after
a
silence
he
explained
heaven
and
thinks
that
i
but
i
couldn
t
tell
a
parson
but
i
don
t
seem
to
have
any
use
for
any
of
the
things
we
are
christians
said
agnes
shyly
dear
love
we
don
t
talk
about
these
things
but
we
believe
them
i
think
that
you
will
get
well
and
be
as
strong
again
as
ever
but
in
any
case
there
is
a
spiritual
life
and
we
know
that
some
day
you
and
i
i
shan
t
do
as
a
spirit
he
interrupted
sighing
pitifully
i
want
you
as
i
am
and
it
can
not
be
managed
the
rector
had
to
say
so
i
want
i
don
t
want
to
talk
i
can
t
see
you
shut
that
she
obeyed
and
crept
into
his
arms
only
this
time
her
grasp
was
the
stronger
her
heart
beat
louder
and
louder
as
the
sound
of
his
grew
more
faint
he
was
crying
like
a
little
frightened
child
and
her
lips
were
wet
with
his
tears
bear
it
bravely
she
told
him
i
can
t
he
whispered
it
isn
t
to
be
done
i
can
t
see
you
and
passed
from
her
trembling
with
open
eyes
she
rode
home
on
her
bicycle
leaving
the
others
to
follow
some
ladies
who
did
not
know
what
had
happened
bowed
and
smiled
as
she
passed
and
she
returned
their
salute
oh
miss
is
it
true
cried
the
cook
her
face
streaming
with
tears
agnes
nodded
presumably
it
was
true
letters
had
just
arrived
one
was
for
gerald
from
his
mother
life
which
had
given
them
no
warning
seemed
to
make
no
comment
now
the
incident
was
outside
nature
and
would
surely
pass
away
like
a
dream
she
felt
slightly
irritable
and
the
grief
of
the
servants
annoyed
her
they
sobbed
ah
look
at
his
marks
ah
little
he
thought
little
he
thought
in
the
brown
holland
strip
by
the
front
door
a
heavy
football
boot
had
left
its
impress
they
had
not
liked
gerald
but
he
was
a
man
they
were
women
he
had
died
their
mistress
ordered
them
to
leave
her
for
many
minutes
she
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
rubbing
her
eyes
an
obscure
spiritual
crisis
was
going
on
should
she
weep
like
the
servants
or
should
she
bear
up
and
trust
in
the
consoler
time
was
the
death
of
a
man
so
terrible
after
all
as
she
invited
herself
to
apathy
there
were
steps
on
the
gravel
and
rickie
elliot
burst
in
he
was
splashed
with
mud
his
breath
was
gone
and
his
hair
fell
wildly
over
his
meagre
face
she
thought
these
are
the
people
who
are
left
alive
from
the
bottom
of
her
soul
she
hated
him
i
came
to
see
what
you
re
doing
he
cried
he
knelt
beside
her
and
she
said
would
you
please
go
away
yes
dear
agnes
of
course
but
i
must
see
first
that
you
her
breath
caught
her
eves
moved
to
the
treads
going
outwards
so
firmly
so
irretrievably
he
panted
it
s
the
worst
thing
that
can
ever
happen
to
you
in
all
your
life
and
you
ve
got
to
mind
it
you
ve
got
to
mind
it
they
ll
come
saying
bear
up
trust
to
no
no
they
re
wrong
mind
through
all
her
misery
she
knew
that
this
boy
was
greater
than
they
supposed
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
with
intense
conviction
cried
but
i
know
i
understand
it
s
your
death
as
well
as
his
he
s
gone
agnes
and
his
arms
will
never
hold
you
again
in
god
s
name
mind
such
a
thing
and
don
t
sit
fencing
with
your
soul
don
t
stop
being
great
that
s
the
one
crime
he
ll
never
forgive
she
faltered
who
who
forgives
at
the
sound
of
his
name
she
slid
forward
and
all
her
dishonesty
left
her
she
acknowledged
that
life
s
meaning
had
vanished
bending
down
she
kissed
the
footprint
how
can
he
forgive
me
she
sobbed
where
has
he
gone
to
you
could
never
dream
such
an
awful
thing
he
couldn
t
see
me
though
i
opened
the
door
wide
plenty
of
light
and
then
he
could
not
remember
the
things
that
should
comfort
him
he
wasn
t
a
he
wasn
t
ever
a
great
reader
and
he
couldn
t
remember
the
things
the
rector
tried
and
he
couldn
t
i
came
and
i
couldn
t
she
could
not
speak
for
tears
rickie
did
not
check
her
he
let
her
accuse
herself
and
fate
and
herbert
who
had
postponed
their
marriage
she
might
have
been
a
wife
six
months
but
herbert
had
spoken
of
and
of
all
life
before
them
he
let
her
kiss
the
footprints
till
their
marks
gave
way
to
the
marks
of
her
lips
she
moaned
he
is
gone
where
is
he
and
then
he
replied
quite
quietly
he
is
in
she
begged
him
not
to
comfort
her
she
could
not
bear
it
i
did
not
come
to
comfort
you
i
came
to
see
that
you
mind
he
is
in
heaven
agnes
the
greatest
thing
is
her
hatred
was
lulled
she
murmured
dear
rickie
and
held
up
her
hand
to
him
through
her
tears
his
meagre
face
showed
as
a
seraph
s
who
spoke
the
truth
and
forbade
her
to
juggle
with
her
soul
dear
rickie
but
for
the
rest
of
my
life
what
am
i
to
do
anything
if
you
remember
that
the
greatest
thing
is
i
don
t
know
you
she
said
tremulously
you
have
grown
up
in
a
moment
you
never
talked
to
us
and
yet
you
understand
it
all
tell
me
again
i
can
only
trust
you
where
he
he
is
in
you
are
sure
it
puzzled
her
that
rickie
who
could
scarcely
tell
you
the
time
without
a
saving
clause
should
be
so
certain
about
immortality
vi
he
did
not
stop
for
the
funeral
pembroke
thought
that
he
had
a
bad
effect
on
agnes
and
prevented
her
from
acquiescing
in
the
tragedy
as
rapidly
as
she
might
have
done
as
he
expressed
it
one
must
not
court
sorrow
and
he
hinted
to
the
young
man
that
they
desired
to
be
alone
rickie
went
back
to
the
silts
he
was
only
there
a
few
days
as
soon
as
term
opened
he
returned
to
cambridge
for
which
he
longed
passionately
the
journey
thither
was
now
familiar
to
him
and
he
took
pleasure
in
each
landmark
the
fair
valley
of
tewin
water
the
cutting
into
hitchin
where
the
train
traverses
the
chalk
baldock
church
royston
with
its
promise
of
downs
were
nothing
in
themselves
but
dear
as
stages
in
the
pilgrimage
towards
the
abode
of
peace
on
the
platform
he
met
friends
they
had
all
had
pleasant
vacations
it
was
a
happy
world
the
atmosphere
alters
cambridge
according
to
her
custom
welcomed
her
sons
with
open
drains
pettycury
was
up
so
was
trinity
street
and
navvies
peeped
out
of
king
s
parade
here
it
was
gas
there
electric
light
but
everywhere
something
and
always
a
smell
it
was
also
the
day
that
the
wheels
fell
off
the
station
tram
and
rickie
who
was
naturally
inside
was
among
the
passengers
who
sustained
no
injury
but
a
shock
and
had
as
hearty
a
laugh
over
the
mishap
afterwards
as
any
tilliard
fled
into
a
hansom
cursing
himself
for
having
tried
to
do
the
thing
cheaply
hornblower
also
swept
past
yelling
derisively
with
his
luggage
neatly
piled
above
his
head
let
s
get
out
and
walk
muttered
ansell
but
rickie
was
succouring
a
distressed
female
aberdeen
oh
aberdeen
i
never
saw
you
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
i
am
so
very
aberdeen
was
cold
she
did
not
like
being
spoken
to
outside
the
college
and
was
also
distrait
about
her
basket
hitherto
no
genteel
eye
had
even
seen
inside
it
but
in
the
collision
its
little
calico
veil
fell
off
and
there
was
revealed
nothing
the
basket
was
empty
and
never
would
hold
anything
illegal
all
the
same
she
was
distrait
and
we
shall
meet
later
sir
i
dessy
was
all
the
greeting
rickie
got
from
her
now
what
kind
of
a
life
has
aberdeen
he
exclaimed
as
he
and
ansell
pursued
the
station
road
here
these
bedders
come
and
make
us
comfortable
we
owe
an
enormous
amount
to
them
their
wages
are
absurd
and
we
know
nothing
about
them
off
they
go
to
barnwell
and
then
their
lives
are
hidden
i
just
know
that
aberdeen
has
a
husband
but
that
s
all
she
never
will
talk
about
him
now
i
do
so
want
to
fill
in
her
life
i
see
of
it
what
s
the
other
half
she
may
have
a
real
jolly
house
in
good
taste
with
a
little
garden
and
books
and
pictures
or
again
she
mayn
t
but
in
any
case
one
ought
to
know
i
know
she
d
dislike
it
but
she
oughtn
t
to
dislike
after
all
bedders
are
to
blame
for
the
present
lamentable
state
of
things
just
as
much
as
gentlefolk
she
ought
to
want
me
to
come
she
ought
to
introduce
me
to
her
they
had
reached
the
corner
of
hills
road
ansell
spoke
for
the
first
time
he
said
ugh
drains
yes
a
spiritual
rickie
laughed
i
expected
it
from
your
the
one
you
never
answered
i
answer
none
of
your
letters
you
are
quite
hopeless
by
now
you
can
go
to
the
bad
but
i
refuse
to
accompany
you
i
refuse
to
believe
that
every
human
being
is
a
moving
wonder
of
supreme
interest
and
tragedy
and
beauty
which
was
what
the
letter
in
question
amounted
to
you
ll
find
plenty
who
will
believe
it
it
s
a
very
popular
view
among
people
who
are
too
idle
to
think
it
saves
them
the
trouble
of
detecting
the
beautiful
from
the
ugly
the
interesting
from
the
dull
the
tragic
from
the
melodramatic
you
had
just
come
from
sawston
and
were
apparently
carried
away
by
the
fact
that
miss
pembroke
had
the
usual
amount
of
arms
and
rickie
was
silent
he
had
told
his
friend
how
he
felt
but
not
what
had
happened
ansell
could
discuss
love
and
death
admirably
but
somehow
he
would
not
understand
lovers
or
a
dying
man
and
in
the
letter
there
had
been
scant
allusion
to
these
concrete
facts
would
cambridge
understand
them
either
he
watched
some
dons
who
were
peeping
into
an
excavation
and
throwing
up
their
hands
with
humorous
gestures
of
despair
these
men
would
lecture
next
week
on
catiline
s
conspiracy
on
luther
on
evolution
on
catullus
they
dealt
with
so
much
and
they
had
experienced
so
little
was
it
possible
he
would
ever
come
to
think
cambridge
narrow
in
his
short
life
rickie
had
known
two
sudden
deaths
and
that
is
enough
to
disarrange
any
placid
outlook
on
the
world
he
knew
once
for
all
that
we
are
all
of
us
bubbles
on
an
extremely
rough
sea
into
this
sea
humanity
has
built
as
it
were
some
little
breakwaters
scientific
knowledge
civilized
restraint
so
that
the
bubbles
do
not
break
so
frequently
or
so
soon
but
the
sea
has
not
altered
and
it
was
only
a
chance
that
he
ansell
tilliard
and
aberdeen
had
not
all
been
killed
in
the
tram
they
waited
for
the
other
tram
by
the
roman
catholic
church
whose
florid
bulk
was
already
receding
into
twilight
it
is
the
first
big
building
that
the
incoming
visitor
sees
oh
here
come
the
colleges
cries
the
protestant
parent
and
then
learns
that
it
was
built
by
a
papist
who
made
a
fortune
out
of
movable
eyes
for
dolls
built
out
of
doll
s
eyes
to
contain
idols
that
at
all
events
is
the
legend
and
the
joke
it
watches
over
the
apostate
city
taller
by
many
a
yard
than
anything
within
and
asserting
however
wildly
that
here
is
eternity
stability
and
bubbles
unbreakable
upon
a
windless
sea
a
costly
hymn
tune
announced
five
o
clock
and
in
the
distance
the
more
lovable
note
of
mary
s
could
be
heard
speaking
from
the
heart
of
the
town
then
the
tram
arrived
the
slow
stuffy
tram
that
plies
every
twenty
minutes
between
the
unknown
and
the
marketplace
and
took
them
past
the
desecrated
grounds
of
downing
past
addenbrookes
hospital
girt
like
a
venetian
palace
with
a
mantling
canal
past
the
fitz
william
towering
upon
immense
substructions
like
any
roman
temple
right
up
to
the
gates
of
one
s
own
college
which
looked
like
nothing
else
in
the
world
the
porters
were
glad
to
see
them
but
wished
it
had
been

hansom

turned
aside
to
some
large
lighted
windows
the
abode
of
a
hospitable
don
and
from
other
windows
there
floated
familiar
voices
and
the
familiar
mistakes
in
a
beethoven
sonata
the
college
though
small
was
civilized
and
proud
of
its
civilization
it
was
not
sufficient
glory
to
be
a
blue
there
nor
an
additional
glory
to
get
drunk
many
a
maiden
lady
who
had
read
that
cambridge
men
were
sad
dogs
was
surprised
and
perhaps
a
little
disappointed
at
the
reasonable
life
which
greeted
her
miss
appleblossom
in
particular
had
had
a
tremendous
shock
the
sight
of
young
fellows
making
tea
and
drinking
water
had
made
her
wonder
whether
this
was
cambridge
college
at
all
it
is
so
she
exclaimed
afterwards
it
is
just
as
i
say
and
what
s
more
i
wouldn
t
have
it
otherwise
stewart
says
it
s
as
easy
as
easy
to
get
into
the
swim
and
not
at
all
the
direction
of
the
swim
was
determined
a
little
by
the
genius
of
the
place
for
places
have
a
genius
though
the
less
we
talk
about
it
the
better
and
a
good
deal
by
the
tutors
and
resident
fellows
who
treated
with
rare
dexterity
the
products
that
came
up
yearly
from
the
public
schools
they
taught
the
perky
boy
that
he
was
not
everything
and
the
limp
boy
that
he
might
be
something
they
even
welcomed
those
boys
who
were
neither
limp
nor
perky
but
odd
those
boys
who
had
never
been
at
a
public
school
at
all
and
such
do
not
find
a
welcome
everywhere
and
they
did
everything
with
ease
one
might
almost
say
with
nonchalance
so
that
the
boys
noticed
nothing
and
received
education
often
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
but
rickie
turned
to
none
of
these
friends
for
just
then
he
loved
his
rooms
better
than
any
person
they
were
all
he
really
possessed
in
the
world
the
only
place
he
could
call
his
own
over
the
door
was
his
name
and
through
the
paint
like
a
grey
ghost
he
could
still
read
the
name
of
his
predecessor
with
a
sigh
of
joy
he
entered
the
perishable
home
that
was
his
for
a
couple
of
years
there
was
a
beautiful
fire
and
the
kettle
boiled
at
once
he
made
tea
on
the
and
ate
the
biscuits
which
aberdeen
had
brought
for
him
up
from
anderson
s
gentlemen
she
said
must
learn
to
give
and
he
sighed
again
and
again
like
one
who
had
escaped
from
danger
with
his
head
on
the
fender
and
all
his
limbs
relaxed
he
felt
almost
as
safe
as
he
felt
once
when
his
mother
killed
a
ghost
in
the
passage
by
carrying
him
through
it
in
her
arms
there
was
no
ghost
now
he
was
frightened
at
reality
he
was
frightened
at
the
splendours
and
horrors
of
the
world
a
letter
from
miss
pembroke
was
on
the
table
he
did
not
hurry
to
open
it
for
she
and
all
that
she
did
was
overwhelming
she
wrote
like
the
sibyl
her
sorrowful
face
moved
over
the
stars
and
shattered
their
harmonies
last
night
he
saw
her
with
the
eyes
of
blake
a
virgin
widow
tall
veiled
consecrated
with
her
hands
stretched
out
against
an
everlasting
wind
why
should
she
write
her
letters
were
not
for
the
likes
of
him
nor
to
be
read
in
rooms
like
his
we
are
not
leaving
sawston
she
wrote
i
saw
how
selfish
it
was
of
me
to
risk
spoiling
herbert
s
career
i
shall
get
used
to
any
place
now
that
he
is
gone
nothing
of
that
sort
can
matter
every
one
has
been
most
kind
but
you
have
comforted
me
most
though
you
did
not
mean
to
i
can
not
think
how
you
did
it
or
understood
so
much
i
still
think
of
you
as
a
little
boy
with
a
lame
leg
i
know
you
will
let
me
say
this
and
yet
when
it
came
to
the
point
you
knew
more
than
people
who
have
been
all
their
lives
with
sorrow
and
rickie
burnt
this
letter
which
he
ought
not
to
have
done
for
it
was
one
of
the
few
tributes
miss
pembroke
ever
paid
to
imagination
but
he
felt
that
it
did
not
belong
to
him
words
so
sincere
should
be
for
gerald
alone
the
smoke
rushed
up
the
chimney
and
he
indulged
in
a
vision
he
saw
it
reach
the
outer
air
and
beat
against
the
low
ceiling
of
clouds
the
clouds
were
too
strong
for
it
but
in
them
was
one
chink
revealing
one
star
and
through
this
the
smoke
escaped
into
the
light
of
stars
innumerable
then
but
then
the
vision
failed
and
the
voice
of
science
whispered
that
all
smoke
remains
on
earth
in
the
form
of
smuts
and
is
troublesome
to
aberdeen
i
am
jolly
unpractical
he
mused
and
what
is
the
point
of
it
when
real
things
are
so
wonderful
who
wants
visions
in
a
world
that
has
agnes
and
gerald
he
turned
on
the
electric
light
and
pulled
open
the
there
among
spoons
and
corks
and
string
he
found
a
fragment
of
a
little
story
that
he
had
tried
to
write
last
term
it
was
called
the
bay
of
the
fifteen
islets
and
the
action
took
place
on
john
s
eve
off
the
coast
of
sicily
a
party
of
tourists
land
on
one
of
the
islands
suddenly
the
boatmen
become
uneasy
and
say
that
the
island
is
not
generally
there
it
is
an
extra
one
and
they
had
better
have
tea
on
one
of
the
ordinaries
pooh
volcanic
says
the
leading
tourist
and
the
ladies
say
how
interesting
the
island
begins
to
rock
and
so
do
the
minds
of
its
visitors
they
start
and
quarrel
and
jabber
fingers
burst
up
through
the
fingers
of
sea
devils
the
island
tilts
the
tourists
go
mad
but
just
before
the
catastrophe
one
man
integer
vitae
scelerisque
purus
sees
the
truth
here
are
no
devils
other
muscles
other
minds
are
pulling
the
island
to
its
subterranean
home
through
the
advancing
wall
of
waters
he
sees
no
grisly
faces
no
ghastly
medieval
limbs
but
but
what
nonsense
when
real
things
are
so
wonderful
what
is
the
point
of
pretending
and
so
rickie
deflected
his
enthusiasms
hitherto
they
had
played
on
gods
and
heroes
on
the
infinite
and
the
impossible
on
virtue
and
beauty
and
strength
now
with
a
steadier
radiance
they
transfigured
a
man
who
was
dead
and
a
woman
who
was
still
alive
vii
love
say
orderly
people
can
be
fallen
into
by
two
methods
through
the
desires
through
the
imagination
and
if
the
orderly
people
are
english
they
add
that
is
the
inferior
method
and
characteristic
of
the
south
it
is
inferior
yet
those
who
pursue
it
at
all
events
know
what
they
want
they
are
not
puzzling
to
themselves
or
ludicrous
to
others
they
do
not
take
the
wings
of
the
morning
and
fly
into
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
sea
before
walking
to
the
registry
office
they
can
not
breed
a
tragedy
quite
like
rickie
s
he
is
of
course
absurdly
young
not
and
he
will
be
engaged
to
be
married
at
he
has
no
knowledge
of
the
world
for
example
he
thinks
that
if
you
do
not
want
money
you
can
give
it
to
friends
who
do
he
believes
in
humanity
because
he
knows
a
dozen
decent
people
he
believes
in
women
because
he
has
loved
his
mother
and
his
friends
are
as
young
and
as
ignorant
as
himself
they
are
full
of
the
wine
of
life
but
they
have
not
tasted
the
cup
let
us
call
it
the
teacup
of
experience
which
has
made
men
of
pembroke
s
type
what
they
are
oh
that
teacup
to
be
taken
at
prayers
at
friendship
at
love
till
we
are
quite
sane
efficient
quite
experienced
and
quite
useless
to
god
or
man
we
must
drink
it
or
we
shall
die
but
we
need
not
drink
it
always
here
is
our
problem
and
our
salvation
there
comes
a
moment
god
knows
when
at
which
we
can
say
i
will
experience
no
longer
i
will
create
i
will
be
an
but
to
do
this
we
must
be
both
acute
and
heroic
for
it
is
not
easy
after
accepting
six
cups
of
tea
to
throw
the
seventh
in
the
face
of
the
hostess
and
to
rickie
this
moment
has
not
as
yet
been
offered
ansell
at
the
end
of
his
third
year
got
a
first
in
the
moral
science
tripos
being
a
scholar
he
kept
his
rooms
in
college
and
at
once
began
to
work
for
a
fellowship
rickie
got
a
creditable
second
in
the
classical
tripos
part
and
retired
to
sallow
lodgings
in
mill
bane
carrying
with
him
the
degree
of
and
a
small
exhibition
which
was
quite
as
much
as
he
deserved
for
part
ii
he
read
greek
archaeology
and
got
a
second
all
this
means
that
ansell
was
much
cleverer
than
rickie
as
for
the
cow
she
was
still
going
strong
though
turning
a
little
academic
as
the
years
passed
over
her
we
are
bound
to
get
narrow
sighed
rickie
he
and
his
friend
were
lying
in
a
meadow
during
their
last
summer
term
in
his
incurable
love
for
flowers
he
had
plaited
two
garlands
of
buttercups
and
and
ansell
s
lean
jewish
face
was
framed
in
one
of
them
cambridge
is
wonderful
but
but
it
s
so
tiny
you
have
no
idea
at
least
i
think
you
have
no
idea
how
the
great
world
looks
down
on
i
read
the
letters
in
the
it
s
a
bad
how
cambridge
has
lost
touch
with
the
was
she
ever
intended
to
touch
them
she
satisfies
said
rickie
mysteriously
neither
the
professions
nor
the
public
schools
nor
the
great
thinking
mass
of
men
and
women
there
is
a
general
feeling
that
her
day
is
over
and
naturally
one
feels
pretty
do
you
still
write
short
stories
because
your
english
has
gone
to
the
devil
you
think
and
talk
in
journalese
define
a
great
thinking
rickie
sat
up
and
adjusted
his
floral
crown
estimate
the
worth
of
a
general
silence
and
thirdly
where
is
the
great
world
oh
that
yes
that
exclaimed
ansell
rising
from
his
couch
in
violent
excitement
where
is
it
how
do
you
set
about
finding
it
how
long
does
it
take
to
get
there
what
does
it
think
what
does
it
do
what
does
it
want
oblige
me
with
specimens
of
its
art
and
silence
till
you
do
my
opinions
will
be
as
follows
there
is
no
great
world
at
all
only
a
little
earth
for
ever
isolated
from
the
rest
of
the
little
solar
system
the
earth
is
full
of
tiny
societies
and
cambridge
is
one
of
them
all
the
societies
are
narrow
but
some
are
good
and
some
are
bad
just
as
one
house
is
beautiful
inside
and
another
ugly
observe
the
metaphor
of
the
houses
i
am
coming
back
to
it
the
good
societies
say
tell
you
to
do
this
because
i
am
the
bad
ones
say
tell
you
to
do
that
because
i
am
the
great
world
not
because
i
am
peckham
or
or
lane
but
i
am
the
great
they
lie
and
fools
like
you
listen
to
them
and
believe
that
they
are
a
thing
which
does
not
exist
and
never
has
existed
and
confuse
great
which
has
no
meaning
whatever
with
good
which
means
salvation
look
at
this
great
wreath
it
ll
be
dead
tomorrow
look
at
that
good
flower
it
ll
come
up
again
next
year
now
for
the
other
metaphor
to
compare
the
world
to
cambridge
is
like
comparing
the
outsides
of
houses
with
the
inside
of
a
house
no
intellectual
effort
is
needed
no
moral
result
is
attained
you
only
have
to
say
oh
what
a
difference
and
then
come
indoors
again
and
exhibit
your
broadened
i
never
shall
come
indoors
again
said
rickie
that
s
the
whole
and
his
voice
began
to
quiver
it
s
well
enough
for
those
who
ll
get
a
fellowship
but
in
a
few
weeks
i
shall
go
down
in
a
few
years
it
ll
be
as
if
i
ve
never
been
up
it
matters
very
much
to
me
what
the
world
is
like
i
can
t
answer
your
questions
about
it
and
that
s
no
loss
to
you
but
so
much
the
worse
for
me
and
then
you
ve
got
a
house
not
a
metaphorical
one
but
a
house
with
father
and
sisters
i
haven
t
and
never
shall
have
there
ll
never
again
be
a
home
for
me
like
cambridge
i
shall
only
look
at
the
outside
of
homes
according
to
your
metaphor
i
shall
live
in
the
street
and
it
matters
very
much
to
me
what
i
find
you
ll
live
in
another
house
right
enough
said
ansell
rather
uneasily
only
take
care
you
pick
out
a
decent
one
i
can
t
think
why
you
flop
about
so
helplessly
like
a
bit
of
seaweed
in
four
years
you
ve
taken
as
much
root
as
any
where
i
should
say
you
ve
been
fortunate
in
your
oh
that
but
he
was
not
cynical
or
cynical
in
a
very
tender
way
he
was
thinking
of
the
irony
of
friendship
so
strong
it
is
and
so
fragile
we
fly
together
like
straws
in
an
eddy
to
part
in
the
open
stream
nature
has
no
use
for
us
she
has
cut
her
stuff
differently
dutiful
sons
loving
husbands
responsible
fathers
these
are
what
she
wants
and
if
we
are
friends
it
must
be
in
our
spare
time
abram
and
sarai
were
sorrowful
yet
their
seed
became
as
sand
of
the
sea
and
distracts
the
politics
of
europe
at
this
moment
but
a
few
verses
of
poetry
is
all
that
survives
of
david
and
jonathan
i
wish
we
were
labelled
said
rickie
he
wished
that
all
the
confidence
and
mutual
knowledge
that
is
born
in
such
a
place
as
cambridge
could
be
organized
people
went
down
into
the
world
saying
we
know
and
like
each
other
we
shan
t
but
they
did
forget
for
man
is
so
made
that
he
can
not
remember
long
without
a
symbol
he
wished
there
was
a
society
a
kind
of
friendship
office
where
the
marriage
of
true
minds
could
be
registered
why
labels
to
know
each
other
i
have
taught
you
pessimism
he
looked
at
his
watch
what
time
not
rickie
got
up
why
go
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
caught
hold
of
rickie
s
ankle
i
ve
got
that
miss
pembroke
to
lunch
that
girl
whom
you
say
never
s
then
why
go
all
this
week
you
have
pretended
miss
pembroke
awaited
you
wednesday
miss
pembroke
to
lunch
thursday
miss
pembroke
to
tea
now
again
and
you
didn
t
even
invite
to
cambridge
no
but
the
hall
man
they
re
stopping
with
has
so
many
engagements
that
she
and
her
friend
can
often
come
to
me
i
m
glad
to
say
i
don
t
think
i
ever
told
you
much
but
over
two
years
ago
the
man
she
was
going
to
marry
was
killed
at
football
she
nearly
died
of
grief
this
visit
to
cambridge
is
almost
the
first
amusement
she
has
felt
up
to
taking
oh
they
go
back
tomorrow
give
me
breakfast
all
but
i
shall
see
you
this
evening
i
shall
be
round
at
your
paper
on
schopenhauer
lem
me
don
t
go
he
said
idly
it
s
much
better
for
you
to
talk
to
lem
me
go
it
s
amusing
that
you
re
so
feeble
you
simply
can
t
get
away
i
wish
i
wanted
to
bully
rickie
laughed
and
suddenly
over
balanced
into
the
grass
ansell
with
unusual
playfulness
held
him
prisoner
they
lay
there
for
few
minutes
talking
and
ragging
aimlessly
then
rickie
seized
his
opportunity
and
jerked
away
go
go
yawned
the
other
but
he
was
a
little
vexed
for
he
was
a
young
man
with
great
capacity
for
pleasure
and
it
pleased
him
that
morning
to
be
with
his
friend
the
thought
of
two
ladies
waiting
lunch
did
not
deter
him
stupid
women
why
shouldn
t
they
wait
why
should
they
interfere
with
their
betters
with
his
ear
on
the
ground
he
listened
to
rickie
s
departing
steps
and
thought
he
wastes
a
lot
of
time
keeping
engagements
why
will
he
be
pleasant
to
fools
and
then
he
thought
why
has
he
turned
so
unhappy
it
isn
t
as
it
he
s
a
philosopher
or
tries
to
solve
the
riddle
of
existence
and
he
s
got
money
of
his
thus
thinking
he
fell
asleep
meanwhile
rickie
hurried
away
from
him
and
slackened
and
stopped
and
hurried
again
he
was
due
at
the
union
in
ten
minutes
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
there
he
dared
not
meet
miss
pembroke
he
loved
her
the
devil
must
have
planned
it
they
had
started
so
gloriously
she
had
been
a
goddess
both
in
joy
and
sorrow
she
was
a
goddess
still
but
he
had
dethroned
the
god
whom
once
he
had
glorified
equally
slowly
slowly
the
image
of
gerald
had
faded
that
was
the
first
step
rickie
had
thought
no
matter
he
will
be
bright
again
just
now
all
the
radiance
chances
to
be
in
and
on
her
he
had
fixed
his
eyes
he
thought
of
her
awake
he
entertained
her
willingly
in
dreams
he
found
her
in
poetry
and
music
and
in
the
sunset
she
made
him
kind
and
strong
she
made
him
clever
through
her
he
kept
cambridge
in
its
proper
place
and
lived
as
a
citizen
of
the
great
world
but
one
night
he
dreamt
that
she
lay
in
his
arms
this
displeased
him
he
determined
to
think
a
little
about
gerald
instead
then
the
fabric
collapsed
it
was
hard
on
rickie
thus
to
meet
the
devil
he
did
not
deserve
it
for
he
was
comparatively
civilized
and
knew
that
there
was
nothing
shameful
in
love
but
to
love
this
woman
if
only
it
had
been
any
one
else
love
in
return
that
he
could
expect
from
no
one
being
too
ugly
and
too
unattractive
but
the
love
he
offered
would
not
then
have
been
vile
the
insult
to
miss
pembroke
who
was
consecrated
and
whom
he
had
consecrated
who
could
still
see
gerald
and
always
would
see
him
shining
on
his
everlasting
throne
this
was
the
crime
from
the
devil
the
crime
that
no
penance
would
ever
purge
she
knew
nothing
she
never
would
know
but
the
crime
was
registered
in
heaven
he
had
been
tempted
to
confide
in
ansell
but
to
what
purpose
he
would
say
i
love
miss
and
stewart
would
reply
you
and
then
i
m
never
going
to
tell
you
ass
again
after
all
it
was
not
a
practical
question
agnes
would
never
hear
of
his
fall
if
his
friend
had
been
as
he
expressed
it
labelled
if
he
had
been
a
father
or
still
better
a
brother
one
might
tell
him
of
the
discreditable
passion
but
why
irritate
him
for
no
reason
thinking
i
am
always
angling
for
sympathy
i
must
stop
myself
he
hurried
onward
to
the
union
he
found
his
guests
half
way
up
the
stairs
reading
the
advertisements
of
coaches
for
the
long
vacation
he
heard
lewin
say
i
wonder
what
he
ll
end
by
a
little
overacting
his
part
he
apologized
nonchalantly
for
his
lateness
it
s
always
the
same
cried
agnes
last
time
he
forgot
i
was
coming
she
wore
a
flowered
muslin
something
indescribably
liquid
and
cool
it
reminded
him
a
little
of
those
swift
piercing
streams
neither
blue
nor
green
that
gush
out
of
the
dolomites
her
face
was
clear
and
brown
like
the
face
of
a
mountaineer
her
hair
was
so
plentiful
that
it
seemed
banked
up
above
it
and
her
little
toque
though
it
answered
the
note
of
the
dress
was
almost
ludicrous
poised
on
so
much
natural
glory
when
she
moved
the
sunlight
flashed
on
her
he
led
them
up
to
the
by
now
he
was
conscious
of
his
limitations
as
a
host
and
never
attempted
to
entertain
ladies
in
his
lodgings
moreover
the
union
seemed
less
intimate
it
had
a
faint
flavour
of
a
london
club
it
marked
the
undergraduate
s
nearest
approach
to
the
great
world
amid
its
waiters
and
serviettes
one
felt
impersonal
and
able
to
conceal
the
private
emotions
rickie
felt
that
if
miss
pembroke
knew
one
thing
about
him
she
knew
everything
during
this
visit
he
took
her
to
no
place
that
he
greatly
loved
sit
down
ladies
fall
to
i
m
sorry
i
was
out
towards
coton
with
a
dreadful
lewin
pushed
up
her
veil
she
was
a
typical
chaperon
always
pleasant
always
hungry
and
always
tired
year
after
year
she
came
up
to
cambridge
in
a
tight
silk
dress
and
year
after
year
she
nearly
died
of
it
her
feet
hurt
her
limbs
were
cramped
in
a
canoe
black
spots
danced
before
her
eyes
from
eating
too
much
mayonnaise
but
still
she
came
if
not
as
a
mother
as
an
aunt
if
not
as
an
aunt
as
a
friend
still
she
ascended
the
roof
of
king
s
still
she
counted
the
balls
of
clare
still
she
was
on
the
point
of
grasping
the
organization
of
the
may
races
and
who
is
your
friend
she
asked
his
name
is
well
now
did
i
see
him
two
years
ago
as
a
bedmaker
in
something
they
did
at
the
foot
lights
oh
how
i
you
didn
t
see
ansell
at
the
foot
lights
said
agnes
smiling
how
do
you
know
asked
rickie
he
d
scarcely
be
so
do
you
remember
seeing
him
for
a
what
a
memory
she
had
and
how
splendidly
during
that
moment
she
had
behaved
isn
t
he
marvellously
clever
i
believe
oh
give
me
clever
people
cried
lewin
they
are
kindness
itself
at
the
hall
but
i
assure
you
i
am
depressed
at
times
one
can
not
talk
for
i
never
hear
about
him
rickie
but
isn
t
he
really
your
greatest
friend
i
don
t
go
in
for
greatest
do
you
mean
you
like
us
all
equally
all
differently
those
of
you
i
ah
you
ve
caught
it
cried
lewin
mr
elliot
gave
it
you
there
agnes
laughed
and
her
elbows
on
the
table
regarded
them
both
through
her
fingers
a
habit
of
hers
then
she
said
can
t
we
see
the
great
ansell
oh
let
s
or
would
he
frighten
me
he
would
frighten
you
said
rickie
he
s
a
trifle
my
good
rickie
if
you
knew
the
deathly
dullness
of
sawston
every
one
saying
the
proper
thing
at
the
proper
time
i
so
proper
herbert
so
proper
why
weirdness
is
the
one
thing
i
long
for
do
arrange
i
m
afraid
there
s
no
opportunity
ansell
goes
some
vast
bicycle
ride
this
afternoon
this
evening
you
re
tied
up
at
the
hall
and
tomorrow
you
but
there
s
breakfast
tomorrow
said
agnes
look
here
rickie
bring
ansell
to
breakfast
with
us
at
lewin
seconded
the
invitation
bad
luck
again
said
rickie
boldly
i
m
already
fixed
up
for
breakfast
i
ll
tell
him
of
your
very
kind
let
s
have
him
alone
murmured
agnes
my
dear
girl
i
should
die
through
the
floor
oh
it
ll
be
all
right
about
breakfast
i
rather
think
we
shall
get
asked
this
evening
by
that
shy
man
who
has
the
pretty
rooms
in
oh
very
well
where
is
it
you
breakfast
rickie
he
faltered
to
ansell
s
it
is
it
seemed
as
if
he
was
making
some
great
admission
so
was
he
that
he
thought
the
two
women
exchanged
glances
had
agnes
already
explored
that
part
of
him
that
did
not
belong
to
her
would
another
chance
step
reveal
the
part
that
did
he
asked
them
abruptly
what
they
would
like
to
do
after
lunch
anything
said
lewin
anything
in
the
a
walk
a
boat
ely
a
drive
some
objection
was
raised
to
each
to
tell
the
truth
she
said
at
last
i
do
feel
a
wee
bit
tired
and
what
occurs
to
me
is
this
you
and
agnes
shall
leave
me
here
and
have
no
more
bother
i
shall
be
perfectly
happy
snoozling
in
one
of
these
delightful
chairs
do
what
you
like
and
then
pick
me
up
after
alas
it
s
against
regulations
said
rickie
the
union
won
t
trust
lady
visitors
on
its
premises
but
who
s
to
know
i
m
alone
with
a
lot
of
men
in
the
how
s
each
to
know
that
i
m
not
with
the
others
that
would
shock
rickie
said
agnes
laughing
he
s
frightfully
no
i
m
not
said
rickie
thinking
of
his
recent
shiftiness
over
breakfast
then
come
for
a
walk
with
me
i
want
exercise
some
connection
of
ours
was
once
rector
of
madingley
i
shall
walk
out
and
see
the
lewin
was
accordingly
left
in
the
union
this
is
jolly
agnes
exclaimed
as
she
strode
along
the
somewhat
depressing
road
that
leads
out
of
cambridge
past
the
observatory
do
i
go
too
fast
no
thank
you
i
get
stronger
every
year
if
it
wasn
t
for
the
look
of
the
thing
i
should
be
quite
but
you
don
t
care
for
the
look
of
the
thing
it
s
only
ignorant
people
who
do
that
perhaps
i
care
i
like
people
who
are
and
beautiful
they
are
of
some
use
in
the
world
i
understand
why
they
are
there
i
can
not
understand
why
the
ugly
and
crippled
are
there
however
healthy
they
may
feel
inside
don
t
you
know
how
turner
spoils
his
pictures
by
introducing
a
man
like
a
bolster
in
the
foreground
well
in
actual
life
every
landscape
is
spoilt
by
men
of
worse
shapes
you
sound
like
a
bolster
with
the
stuffing
they
laughed
she
always
blew
his
cobwebs
away
like
this
with
a
puff
of
humorous
mountain
air
just
now
the
associations
he
attached
to
her
were
various
she
reminded
him
of
a
heroine
of
meredith
s
but
a
heroine
at
the
end
of
the
book
all
had
been
written
about
her
she
had
played
her
mighty
part
and
knew
that
it
was
over
he
and
he
alone
was
not
content
and
wrote
for
her
daily
a
trivial
and
impossible
sequel
last
time
they
had
talked
about
gerald
but
that
was
some
six
months
ago
when
things
felt
easier
today
gerald
was
the
faintest
blur
fortunately
the
conversation
turned
to
pembroke
and
to
education
did
women
lose
a
lot
by
not
knowing
greek
a
heap
said
rickie
roughly
but
modern
languages
thus
they
got
to
germany
which
he
had
visited
last
easter
with
ansell
and
thence
to
the
german
emperor
and
what
a
he
made
and
from
him
to
our
own
king
still
prince
of
wales
who
had
lived
while
an
undergraduate
at
madingley
hall
here
it
was
and
all
the
time
he
thought
it
is
hard
on
her
she
has
no
right
to
be
walking
with
me
she
would
be
ill
with
disgust
if
she
knew
it
is
hard
on
her
to
be
they
looked
at
the
hall
and
went
inside
the
pretty
little
church
some
arundel
prints
hung
upon
the
pillars
and
agnes
expressed
the
opinion
that
pictures
inside
a
place
of
worship
were
a
pity
rickie
did
not
agree
with
this
he
said
again
that
nothing
beautiful
was
ever
to
be
regretted
you
re
cracked
on
beauty
she
whispered
they
were
still
inside
the
church
do
hurry
up
and
write
something
beautiful
i
believe
you
can
i
m
going
to
lecture
you
seriously
all
the
way
home
take
care
that
you
don
t
waste
your
they
continued
the
conversation
outside
but
i
ve
got
to
hate
my
own
writing
i
believe
that
most
people
come
to
that
stage
not
so
early
though
what
i
write
is
too
silly
it
can
t
happen
for
instance
a
stupid
vulgar
man
is
engaged
to
a
lovely
young
lady
he
wants
her
to
live
in
the
towns
but
she
only
cares
for
woods
she
shocks
him
this
way
and
that
but
gradually
he
tames
her
and
makes
her
nearly
as
dull
as
he
is
one
day
she
has
a
last
explosion
over
the
snobby
wedding
presents
and
flies
out
of
the
window
shouting
freedom
and
truth
near
the
house
is
a
little
dell
full
of
and
she
runs
into
it
he
comes
there
the
next
moment
but
she
s
awfully
exciting
where
oh
lord
she
s
a
dryad
cried
rickie
in
great
disgust
she
s
turned
into
a
rickie
it
s
very
good
indeed
the
kind
of
thing
has
something
in
it
of
course
you
get
it
all
through
greek
and
latin
how
upset
the
man
must
be
when
he
sees
the
girl
he
doesn
t
see
her
he
never
guesses
such
a
man
could
never
see
a
so
you
describe
how
she
turns
just
before
he
comes
up
no
indeed
i
don
t
ever
say
that
she
does
turn
i
don
t
use
the
word
dryad
i
think
you
ought
to
put
that
part
plainly
otherwise
with
such
an
original
story
people
might
miss
the
point
have
you
had
any
luck
with
it
magazines
i
haven
t
tried
i
know
what
the
stuff
s
worth
you
see
a
year
or
two
ago
i
had
a
great
idea
of
getting
into
touch
with
nature
just
as
the
greeks
were
in
touch
and
seeing
england
so
beautiful
i
used
to
pretend
that
her
trees
and
coppices
and
summer
fields
of
parsley
were
alive
it
s
funny
enough
now
but
it
wasn
t
funny
then
for
i
got
in
such
a
state
that
i
believed
actually
believed
that
fauns
lived
in
a
certain
double
hedgerow
near
the
cog
magogs
and
one
evening
i
walked
a
mile
sooner
than
go
through
it
good
gracious
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
he
moved
to
the
other
side
of
the
road
it
s
all
right
now
i
ve
changed
those
follies
for
others
but
while
i
had
them
i
began
to
write
and
even
now
i
keep
on
writing
though
i
know
better
i
ve
got
quite
a
pile
of
little
stories
all
harping
on
this
ridiculous
idea
of
getting
into
touch
with
i
wish
you
weren
t
so
modest
it
s
simply
splendid
as
an
idea
though
but
tell
me
about
the
dryad
who
was
engaged
to
be
married
what
was
she
like
i
can
show
you
the
dell
in
which
the
young
person
disappeared
we
pass
it
on
the
right
in
a
it
does
seem
a
pity
that
you
don
t
make
something
of
your
talents
it
seems
such
a
waste
to
write
little
stories
and
never
publish
them
you
must
have
enough
for
a
book
life
is
so
full
in
our
days
that
short
stories
are
the
very
thing
they
get
read
by
people
who
d
never
tackle
a
novel
for
example
at
our
dorcas
we
tried
to
read
out
a
long
affair
by
henry
james
herbert
saw
it
recommended
in
the
there
was
no
doubt
it
was
very
good
but
one
simply
couldn
t
remember
from
one
week
to
another
what
had
happened
so
now
our
aim
is
to
get
something
that
just
lasts
the
hour
i
take
you
seriously
rickie
and
that
is
why
i
am
so
offensive
you
are
too
modest
people
who
think
they
can
do
nothing
so
often
do
nothing
i
want
you
to
it
thrilled
him
like
a
she
took
him
seriously
could
he
but
thank
her
for
her
divine
affability
but
the
words
would
stick
in
his
throat
or
worse
still
would
bring
other
words
along
with
them
his
breath
came
quickly
for
he
seldom
spoke
of
his
writing
and
no
one
not
even
ansell
had
advised
him
to
plunge
but
do
you
really
think
that
i
could
take
up
literature
why
not
you
can
try
even
if
you
fail
you
can
try
of
course
we
think
you
tremendously
clever
and
i
met
one
of
your
dons
at
tea
and
he
said
that
your
degree
was
not
in
the
least
a
proof
of
your
abilities
he
said
that
you
knocked
up
and
got
flurried
in
examinations
oh
her
cheek
flushed
i
wish
i
was
a
man
the
whole
world
lies
before
them
they
can
do
anything
they
aren
t
cooped
up
with
servants
and
tea
parties
and
twaddle
but
where
s
this
dell
where
the
dryad
disappeared
we
ve
passed
he
had
meant
to
pass
it
it
was
too
beautiful
all
he
had
read
all
he
had
hoped
for
all
he
had
loved
seemed
to
quiver
in
its
enchanted
air
it
was
perilous
he
dared
not
enter
it
with
such
a
woman
how
long
ago
she
turned
back
i
don
t
want
to
miss
the
dell
here
it
must
be
she
added
after
a
few
moments
and
sprang
up
the
green
bank
that
hid
the
entrance
from
the
road
oh
what
a
jolly
place
go
right
in
if
you
want
to
see
it
said
rickie
and
did
not
offer
to
go
with
her
she
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
the
view
for
a
few
steps
will
increase
a
view
in
cambridgeshire
the
wind
blew
her
dress
against
her
then
like
a
cataract
again
she
vanished
pure
and
cool
into
the
dell
the
young
man
thought
of
her
feelings
no
longer
his
heart
throbbed
louder
and
louder
and
seemed
to
shake
him
to
pieces
rickie
she
was
calling
from
the
dell
for
an
answer
he
sat
down
where
he
was
on
the
margin
she
could
call
as
loud
as
she
liked
the
devil
had
done
much
but
he
should
not
take
him
to
her
rickie
and
it
came
with
the
tones
of
an
angel
he
drove
his
fingers
into
his
ears
and
invoked
the
name
of
gerald
but
there
was
no
sign
neither
angry
motion
in
the
air
nor
hint
of
january
mist
june
fields
of
june
sky
of
june
songs
of
june
grass
of
june
beneath
him
grass
of
june
over
the
tragedy
he
had
deemed
immortal
a
bird
called
out
of
the
dell
rickie
a
bird
flew
into
the
dell
did
you
take
me
for
the
dryad
she
asked
she
was
sitting
down
with
his
head
on
her
lap
he
had
laid
it
there
for
a
moment
before
he
went
out
to
die
and
she
had
not
let
him
take
it
away
i
prayed
you
might
not
be
a
woman
he
whispered
darling
i
am
very
much
a
woman
i
do
not
vanish
into
groves
and
trees
i
thought
you
would
never
did
you
expect
i
hoped
i
called
inside
the
dell
it
was
neither
june
nor
january
the
chalk
walls
barred
out
the
seasons
and
the
did
not
seem
to
feel
their
passage
only
from
time
to
time
the
odours
of
summer
slipped
in
from
the
wood
above
to
comment
on
the
waxing
year
she
bent
down
to
touch
him
with
her
lips
he
started
and
cried
passionately
never
forget
that
your
greatest
thing
is
over
i
have
forgotten
i
am
too
weak
you
shall
never
forget
what
i
said
to
you
then
is
greater
than
what
i
say
to
you
now
what
he
gave
you
then
is
greater
than
anything
you
will
get
from
she
was
frightened
again
she
had
the
sense
of
something
abnormal
then
she
said
what
is
all
this
nonsense
and
folded
him
in
her
arms
viii
ansell
stood
looking
at
his
which
was
laid
for
four
instead
of
two
his
bedmaker
equally
peevish
explained
how
it
had
happened
last
night
at
one
in
the
morning
the
porter
had
been
awoke
with
a
note
for
the
kitchens
and
in
that
note
elliot
said
that
all
these
things
were
to
be
sent
to
ansell
s
the
fools
have
sent
the
original
order
as
well
here
s
the
for
two
i
can
t
move
for
the
note
being
ambiguous
the
kitchens
judged
best
to
send
it
she
spoke
of
the
kitchens
in
a
way
much
as
one
speaks
of
parliament
who
s
to
pay
for
it
he
peeped
into
the
new
dishes
kidneys
entombed
in
an
omelette
hot
roast
chicken
in
watery
gravy
a
glazed
but
pallid
pie
and
who
s
to
wash
it
up
said
the
bedmaker
to
her
help
outside
ansell
had
disputed
late
last
night
concerning
schopenhauer
and
was
a
little
cross
and
tired
he
bounced
over
to
tilliard
who
kept
opposite
tilliard
was
eating
gooseberry
jam
did
elliot
ask
you
to
breakfast
with
me
no
said
tilliard
mildly
well
you
d
better
come
and
bring
every
one
you
so
tilliard
came
bearing
himself
a
little
formally
for
he
was
not
very
intimate
with
his
neighbour
out
of
the
window
they
called
to
widdrington
but
he
laid
his
hand
on
his
stomach
thus
indicating
it
was
too
late
who
s
to
pay
for
it
repeated
ansell
as
a
man
appeared
from
the
buttery
carrying
coffee
on
a
bright
tin
tray
college
coffee
how
nice
remarked
tilliard
who
was
cutting
the
pie
but
before
term
ends
you
must
come
and
try
my
new
machine
my
sister
gave
it
me
there
is
a
bulb
at
the
top
and
as
the
water
boils
he
might
have
the
that
s
rickie
all
over
violently
economical
and
then
loses
his
head
and
all
the
things
go
give
them
to
the
bedder
while
they
re
this
was
done
she
accepted
them
dispassionately
with
the
air
of
one
who
lives
without
nourishment
tilliard
continued
to
describe
his
sister
s
coffee
machine
what
s
that
they
could
hear
panting
and
rustling
on
the
stairs
it
sounds
like
a
lady
said
tilliard
fearfully
he
slipped
the
piece
of
pie
back
it
fell
into
position
like
a
brick
is
it
here
am
i
right
is
it
here
the
door
opened
and
in
came
lewin
oh
horrors
i
ve
made
a
that
s
all
right
said
ansell
awkwardly
i
wanted
elliot
where
are
they
we
expect
elliot
said
tilliard
don
t
tell
me
i
m
right
cried
lewin
and
that
you
re
the
terrifying
and
with
obvious
relief
she
wrung
tilliard
warmly
by
the
hand
i
m
ansell
said
ansell
looking
very
uncouth
and
grim
how
stupid
of
me
not
to
know
it
she
gasped
and
would
have
gone
on
to
i
know
not
what
but
the
door
opened
again
it
was
rickie
here
s
miss
pembroke
he
said
i
am
going
to
marry
there
was
a
profound
silence
we
oughtn
t
to
have
done
things
like
this
said
agnes
turning
to
lewin
we
have
no
right
to
take
ansell
by
surprise
it
is
rickie
s
fault
he
was
that
obstinate
he
would
bring
us
he
ought
to
be
he
ought
indeed
said
tilliard
pleasantly
and
bolted
not
till
he
gained
his
room
did
he
realize
that
he
had
been
less
apt
than
usual
as
for
ansell
the
first
thing
he
said
was
why
didn
t
you
the
in
such
a
situation
lewin
was
of
priceless
value
she
led
the
way
to
the
table
observing
i
quite
agree
with
miss
pembroke
i
loathe
surprises
never
shall
i
forget
my
horror
when
the
painted
the
dove
s
cage
with
the
dove
inside
he
did
it
as
a
surprise
poor
parsival
nearly
died
his
feathers
were
bright
green
well
give
me
the
said
rickie
i
like
the
bedder
s
got
well
there
you
are
what
s
there
to
be
annoyed
about
and
while
the
cage
was
drying
we
put
him
among
the
bantams
they
had
been
the
greatest
allies
but
i
suppose
they
took
him
for
a
parrot
or
a
hawk
or
something
that
bantams
hate
for
while
his
cage
was
drying
they
picked
out
his
feathers
and
picked
and
picked
out
his
feathers
till
he
was
perfectly
bald
hugo
look
said
i
this
is
the
end
of
parsival
let
me
have
no
more
he
burst
into
thus
did
lewin
create
an
atmosphere
at
first
it
seemed
unreal
but
gradually
they
got
used
to
it
and
breathed
scarcely
anything
else
throughout
the
meal
in
such
an
atmosphere
everything
seemed
of
small
and
equal
value
and
the
engagement
of
rickie
and
agnes
like
the
feathers
of
parsival
fluttered
lightly
to
the
ground
ansell
was
generally
silent
he
was
no
match
for
these
two
quite
clever
women
only
once
was
there
a
hitch
they
had
been
talking
gaily
enough
about
the
betrothal
when
ansell
suddenly
interrupted
with
when
is
the
marriage
mr
ansell
said
agnes
blushing
i
wish
you
hadn
t
asked
that
that
part
s
dreadful
not
for
years
as
far
as
we
can
but
rickie
had
not
seen
as
far
he
had
not
talked
to
her
of
this
at
all
last
night
they
had
spoken
only
of
love
he
exclaimed
oh
t
lewin
laughed
roguishly
why
this
delay
asked
ansell
agnes
looked
at
rickie
who
replied
i
must
get
money
worse
i
thought
you
d
got
he
hesitated
and
then
said
i
must
get
my
foot
on
the
ladder
ansell
began
with
on
which
ladder
but
lewin
using
the
privilege
of
her
sex
exclaimed
not
another
word
if
there
s
a
thing
i
abominate
it
is
plans
my
head
goes
whirling
at
what
she
really
abominated
was
questions
and
she
saw
that
ansell
was
turning
serious
to
appease
him
she
put
on
her
clever
manner
and
asked
him
about
germany
how
had
it
impressed
him
were
we
so
totally
unfitted
to
repel
invasion
was
not
german
scholarship
overestimated
he
replied
discourteously
but
he
did
reply
and
if
she
could
have
stopped
him
thinking
her
triumph
would
have
been
complete
when
they
rose
to
go
agnes
held
ansell
s
hand
for
a
moment
in
her
own
she
said
it
was
very
unconventional
of
us
to
come
as
we
did
but
i
don
t
think
any
of
us
are
conventional
he
only
replied
the
ladies
started
off
rickie
lingered
behind
to
whisper
i
would
have
it
so
i
would
have
you
begin
square
together
i
can
t
talk
yet
i
ve
loved
her
for
years
can
t
think
what
she
s
done
it
for
i
m
going
to
write
short
stories
i
shall
start
this
afternoon
she
declares
there
may
be
something
in
as
soon
as
he
had
left
tilliard
burst
in
white
with
agitation
and
crying
did
you
see
my
awful
faux
pas
about
the
horsewhip
what
shall
i
do
i
must
call
on
elliot
or
had
i
better
write
miss
pembroke
will
not
mind
said
ansell
gravely
she
is
he
knelt
in
an
and
hid
his
face
in
the
back
it
was
like
a
bomb
said
tilliard
it
was
meant
to
i
do
feel
a
fool
what
must
she
think
never
mind
tilliard
you
ve
not
been
as
big
a
fool
as
myself
at
all
events
you
told
her
he
must
be
tilliard
hummed
a
little
tune
he
hated
anything
nasty
and
there
was
nastiness
in
ansell
what
did
you
tell
her
he
asked
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
think
damn
those
ah
yes
one
hates
one
s
friends
to
get
engaged
it
makes
one
feel
so
old
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
the
brother
just
above
me
has
lately
married
and
my
sister
was
quite
sick
about
it
though
the
thing
was
suitable
in
every
damn
these
women
then
said
ansell
bouncing
round
in
the
chair
damn
these
particular
they
looked
and
spoke
like
exactly
their
diplomacy
was
ladylike
their
lies
were
ladylike
they
ve
caught
elliot
in
a
most
ladylike
way
i
saw
it
all
during
the
one
moment
we
were
natural
generally
we
were
clattering
after
the
married
one
whom
like
a
fool
i
took
for
a
fool
but
for
one
moment
we
were
natural
and
during
that
moment
miss
pembroke
told
a
lie
and
made
rickie
believe
it
was
the
what
did
she
say
she
said
see
instead
of
i
tilliard
burst
into
laughter
this
jaundiced
young
philosopher
with
his
kinky
view
of
life
was
too
much
for
him
she
said
we
see
repeated
ansell
instead
of
i
see
and
she
made
him
believe
that
it
was
the
truth
she
caught
him
and
makes
him
believe
that
he
caught
her
she
came
to
see
me
and
makes
him
think
that
it
is
his
idea
that
is
what
i
mean
when
i
say
that
she
is
a
you
are
too
subtle
for
me
my
dull
eyes
could
only
see
two
happy
i
never
said
they
weren
t
then
my
dear
ansell
why
are
you
so
cut
up
it
s
beastly
when
a
friend
marries
and
i
grant
he
s
rather
young
but
i
should
say
it
s
the
best
thing
for
him
a
decent
woman
and
you
have
proved
not
one
thing
against
her
a
decent
woman
will
keep
him
up
to
the
mark
and
stop
him
getting
slack
she
ll
make
him
responsible
and
manly
for
much
as
i
like
rickie
i
always
find
him
a
little
effeminate
and
really
his
voice
grew
sharper
for
he
was
irritated
by
ansell
s
conceit
and
really
you
talk
as
if
you
were
mixed
up
in
the
affair
they
pay
a
civil
visit
to
your
rooms
and
you
see
nothing
but
dark
plots
and
challenges
to
war
cried
ansell
crashing
his
fists
together
it
s
war
then
oh
what
a
lot
of
said
tilliard
can
t
a
man
and
woman
get
engaged
my
dear
boy
excuse
me
talking
like
this
what
on
earth
is
it
to
do
with
us
we
re
his
friends
and
i
hope
we
always
shall
be
but
we
shan
t
keep
his
friendship
by
fighting
we
re
bound
to
fall
into
the
background
wife
first
friends
some
way
after
you
may
resent
the
order
but
it
is
ordained
by
the
point
is
not
what
s
ordained
by
nature
or
any
other
fool
but
what
s
you
are
hopelessly
unpractical
said
tilliard
turning
away
and
let
me
remind
you
that
you
ve
already
given
away
your
case
by
acknowledging
that
they
re
she
is
happy
because
she
has
conquered
he
is
happy
because
he
has
at
last
hung
all
the
world
s
beauty
on
to
a
single
peg
he
was
always
trying
to
do
it
he
used
to
call
the
peg
humanity
will
either
of
these
happinesses
last
his
can
t
hers
only
for
a
time
i
fight
this
woman
not
only
because
she
fights
me
but
because
i
foresee
the
most
appalling
catastrophe
she
wants
rickie
partly
to
replace
another
man
whom
she
lost
two
years
ago
partly
to
make
something
out
of
him
he
is
to
write
in
time
she
will
get
sick
of
this
he
won
t
get
famous
she
will
only
see
how
thin
he
is
and
how
lame
she
will
long
for
a
jollier
husband
and
i
don
t
blame
her
and
having
made
him
thoroughly
miserable
and
degraded
she
will
bolt
if
she
can
do
it
like
a
such
were
the
opinions
of
stewart
ansell
ix
seven
letters
written
in
june
cambridge
dear
rickie
i
would
rather
write
and
you
can
guess
what
kind
of
letter
this
is
when
i
say
it
is
a
fair
copy
i
have
been
making
rough
drafts
all
the
morning
when
i
talk
i
get
angry
and
also
at
times
try
to
be
clever
two
reasons
why
i
fail
to
get
attention
paid
to
me
this
is
a
letter
of
the
prudent
sort
if
it
makes
you
break
off
the
engagement
its
work
is
done
you
are
not
a
person
who
ought
to
marry
at
all
you
are
unfitted
in
body
that
we
once
discussed
you
are
also
unfitted
in
soul
you
want
and
you
need
to
like
many
people
and
a
man
of
that
sort
ought
not
to
marry
you
never
were
attached
to
that
great
sect
who
can
like
one
person
only
and
if
you
try
to
enter
it
you
will
find
destruction
i
have
read
in
books
and
i
can
not
afford
to
despise
books
they
are
all
that
i
have
to
go
by
that
men
and
women
desire
different
things
man
wants
to
love
mankind
woman
wants
to
love
one
man
when
she
has
him
her
work
is
over
she
is
the
emissary
of
nature
and
nature
s
bidding
has
been
fulfilled
but
man
does
not
care
a
damn
for
nature
or
at
least
only
a
very
little
damn
he
cares
for
a
hundred
things
besides
and
the
more
civilized
he
is
the
more
he
will
care
for
these
other
hundred
things
and
demand
not
only
a
wife
and
children
but
also
friends
and
work
and
spiritual
freedom
i
believe
you
to
be
extraordinarily
yours
ever
shelthorpe
sawston
park
road
sawston
dear
ansell
but
i
m
in
love
a
detail
you
ve
forgotten
i
can
t
listen
to
english
essays
the
wretched
agnes
may
be
an
emissary
of
nature
but
i
only
grinned
when
i
read
it
i
may
be
extraordinarily
civilized
but
i
don
t
feel
so
i
m
in
love
and
i
ve
found
a
woman
to
love
me
and
i
mean
to
have
the
hundred
other
things
as
well
she
wants
me
to
have
them
friends
and
work
and
spiritual
freedom
and
everything
you
and
your
books
miss
this
because
your
books
are
too
sedate
read
poetry
not
only
shelley
understand
beatrice
and
clara
middleton
and
brunhilde
in
the
first
scene
of
gotterdammerung
understand
goethe
when
he
says
the
eternal
feminine
leads
us
on
and
don
t
write
another
english
yours
ever
affectionately
cambridge
dear
rickie
what
am
i
to
say
understand
xanthippe

elsa
in
the
question
scene
of
lohengrin
understand
euripides
when
he
says
the
eternal
feminine
leads
us
a
pretty
dance
i
shall
say
nothing
of
the
sort
the
allusions
in
this
english
essay
shall
not

as
follows
she
is
not
serious
she
is
not
truthful

my
dear
stewart
you
couldn
t
know
i
didn
t
know
for
a
moment
but
this
letter
of
yours
is
the
most
wonderful
thing
that
has
ever
happened
to
me
yet
more
wonderful
i
don
t
exaggerate
than
the
moment
when
agnes
promised
to
marry
me
i
always
knew
you
liked
me
but
i
never
knew
how
much
until
this
letter
up
to
now
i
think
we
have
been
too
much
like
the
strong
heroes
in
books
who
feel
so
much
and
say
so
little
and
feel
all
the
more
for
saying
so
little
now
that
s
over
and
we
shall
never
be
that
kind
of
an
ass
again
we
ve
hit
by
accident
upon
something
permanent
you
ve
written
to
me
i
hate
the
woman
who
will
be
your
wife
and
i
write
back
hate
her
can
t
i
love
you
both
she
will
never
come
between
us
stewart
she
wouldn
t
wish
to
but
that
s
by
the
way
because
our
friendship
has
now
passed
beyond
intervention
no
third
person
could
break
it
we
couldn
t
ourselves
i
fancy
we
may
quarrel
and
argue
till
one
of
us
dies
but
the
thing
is
registered
i
only
wish
dear
man
you
could
be
happier
for
me
it
s
as
if
a
light
was
suddenly
held
behind
the
world
shelthorpe

sawston
dear
lewin
the
time
goes
flying
but
i
am
getting
to
learn
my
wonderful
boy
we
speak
a
great
deal
about
his
work
he
has
just
finished
a
curious
thing
called
nemi
about
a
roman
ship
that
is
actually
sunk
in
some
lake
i
can
not
think
how
he
describes
the
things
when
he
has
never
seen
them
if
as
i
hope
he
goes
to
italy
next
year
he
should
turn
out
something
really
good
meanwhile
we
are
hunting
for
a
publisher
herbert
believes
that
a
collection
of
short
stories
is
hard
to
get
published
it
is
after
all
better
to
write
one
long
one
but
you
must
not
think
we
only
talk
books
what
we
say
on
other
topics
can
not
so
easily
be
repeated
oh
mrs
lewin
he
is
a
dear
and
dearer
than
ever
now
that
we
have
him
at
sawston
herbert
in
a
quiet
way
has
been
making
inquiries
about
those
cambridge
friends
of
his
nothing
against
them
but
they
seem
to
be
terribly
eccentric
none
of
them
are
good
at
games
and
they
spend
all
their
spare
time
thinking
and
discussing
they
discuss
what
one
knows
and
what
one
never
will
know
and
what
one
had
much
better
not
know
herbert
says
it
is
because
they
have
not
got
enough
to
ever
your
grateful
and
affectionate
friend
agnes
pembroke
shelthorpe
sawston
park
road
sawston
dear
silt
thank
you
for
the
congratulations
which
i
have
handed
over
to
the
delighted
rickie
the
congratulations
were
really
addressed
to
agnes
a
social
blunder
which
pembroke
deftly
corrects
i
am
sorry
that
the
rumor
reached
you
that
i
was
not
pleased
anything
pleases
me
that
promises
my
sister
s
happiness
and
i
have
known
your
cousin
nearly
as
long
as
you
have
it
will
be
a
very
long
engagement
for
he
must
make
his
way
first
the
dear
boy
is
not
nearly
as
wealthy
as
he
supposed
having
no
tastes
and
hardly
any
expenses
he
used
to
talk
as
if
he
were
a
millionaire
he
must
at
least
double
his
income
before
he
can
dream
of
more
intimate
ties
this
has
been
a
bitter
pill
but
i
am
glad
to
say
that
they
have
accepted
it
bravely
hoping
that
you
and
silt
will
profit
by
your
week
at
remain
yours
very
sincerely
herbert
pembroke
cadover
wilts
dear
miss
pembroke
agnes
i
hear
that
you
are
going
to
marry
my
nephew
i
have
no
idea
what
he
is
like
and
wonder
whether
you
would
bring
him
that
i
may
find
out
isn
t
september
rather
a
nice
month
you
might
have
to
go
to
stone
henge
but
with
that
exception
would
be
left
unmolested
i
do
hope
you
will
manage
the
visit
we
met
once
at
lewin
s
and
i
have
a
very
clear
recollection
of
believe
me
yours
sincerely

the
rain
tilted
a
little
from
the
for
the
most
part
it
fell
from
a
grey
cloud
silently
but
now
and
then
the
tilt
increased
and
a
kind
of
sigh
passed
over
the
country
as
the
drops
lashed
the
walls
trees
shepherds
and
other
motionless
objects
that
stood
in
their
slanting
career
at
times
the
cloud
would
descend
and
visibly
embrace
the
earth
to
which
it
had
only
sent
messages
and
the
earth
itself
would
bring
forth
clouds
clouds
of
a
whiter
breed
which
formed
in
shallow
valleys
and
followed
the
courses
of
the
streams
it
seemed
the
beginning
of
life
again
god
said
shall
we
divide
the
waters
from
the
land
or
not
was
not
the
firmament
labour
and
glory
sufficient
at
all
events
it
was
the
beginning
of
life
pastoral
behind
which
imagination
can
not
travel
yet
complicated
people
were
getting
wet
not
only
the
shepherds
for
instance
the
was
sopping
so
was
the
vicar
s
wife
so
were
the
lieutenant
and
the
peevish
damsels
in
his
battleston
car
gallantry
charity
and
art
pursued
their
various
missions
perspiring
and
muddy
while
out
on
the
slopes
beyond
them
stood
the
eternal
man
and
the
eternal
dog
guarding
eternal
sheep
until
the
world
is
vegetarian
inside
an
arbour
which
faced
east
and
thus
avoided
the
bad
weather
there
sat
a
complicated
person
who
was
dry
she
looked
at
the
drenched
world
with
a
pleased
expression
and
would
smile
when
a
cloud
would
lay
down
on
the
village
or
when
the
rain
sighed
louder
than
usual
against
her
solid
shelter
ink
paperclips
and
foolscap
paper
were
on
the
table
before
her
and
she
could
also
reach
an
umbrella
a
waterproof
a
and
an
electric
bell
her
age
was
between
elderly
and
old
and
her
forehead
was
wrinkled
with
an
expression
of
slight
but
perpetual
pain
but
the
lines
round
her
mouth
indicated
that
she
had
laughed
a
great
deal
during
her
life
just
as
the
clean
tight
skin
round
her
eyes
perhaps
indicated
that
she
had
not
often
cried
she
was
dressed
in
brown
silk
a
brown
silk
shawl
lay
most
becomingly
over
her
beautiful
hair
after
long
thought
she
wrote
on
the
paper
in
front
of
her
the
subject
of
this
memoir
first
saw
the
light
at
wolverhampton
on
may
the
she
laid
down
her
pen
and
said
ugh
a
robin
hopped
in
and
she
welcomed
him
a
sparrow
followed
and
she
stamped
her
foot
she
watched
some
thick
white
water
which
was
sliding
like
a
snake
down
the
gutter
of
the
gravel
path
it
had
just
appeared
it
must
have
escaped
from
a
hollow
in
the
chalk
up
behind
the
earth
could
absorb
no
longer
the
lady
did
not
think
of
all
this
for
she
hated
questions
of
whence
and
wherefore
and
the
ways
of
the
earth
our
dull
stepmother
bored
her
unspeakably
but
the
water
just
the
snake
of
water
was
amusing
and
she
flung
her
golosh
at
it
to
dam
it
up
then
she
wrote
feverishly
the
subject
of
this
memoir
first
saw
the
light
in
the
middle
of
the
night
it
was
twenty
to
eleven
his
pa
was
a
parson
but
he
was
not
his
pa
s
son
and
never
went
to
there
was
the
sound
of
a
train
and
presently
white
smoke
appeared
rising
laboriously
through
the
heavy
air
it
distracted
her
and
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
sat
perfectly
still
doing
nothing
at
last
she
pushed
the
spoilt
paper
aside
took
afresh
piece
and
was
beginning
to
write
on
may
the
when
there
was
a
crunch
on
the
gravel
and
a
furious
voice
said
i
am
sorry
for
flea
i
daresay
i
am
sorry
for
him
too
said
the
lady
her
voice
was
languid
and
pleasant
who
is
he
flea
s
a
liar
and
the
next
time
we
meet
he
ll
be
a
off
slipped
a
sodden
ulster
he
hung
it
up
angrily
upon
a
peg
the
arbour
provided
several
but
who
is
he
and
why
has
he
that
disastrous
name
flea
fleance
all
the
thompsons
are
named
out
of
shakespeare
he
grazes
the
ah
i
see
a
pet
lamb
shepherd
one
of
my
shepherds
the
last
time
i
go
with
his
sheep
but
not
the
last
time
he
sees
me
i
am
sorry
for
him
he
dodged
me
do
you
mean
to
say
she
became
animated
that
you
have
been
out
in
the
wet
keeping
the
sheep
of
flea
thompson
i
had
he
blew
on
his
fingers
and
took
off
his
cap
water
trickled
over
his
unshaven
cheeks
his
hair
was
so
wet
that
it
seemed
worked
upon
his
scalp
in
bronze
get
away
bad
dog
screamed
the
lady
for
he
had
given
himself
a
shake
and
spattered
her
dress
with
water
he
was
a
powerful
boy
of
twenty
admirably
muscular
but
rather
too
broad
for
his
height
people
called
him
podge
until
they
were
dissuaded
then
they
called
him
stephen
or
mr
then
he
said
you
can
call
me
podge
if
you
as
for
flea
he
began
tempestuously
he
sat
down
by
her
and
with
much
heavy
breathing
told
the
story
flea
has
a
girl
at
wintersbridge
and
i
had
to
go
with
his
sheep
while
he
went
to
see
her
two
hours
we
agreed
half
an
hour
to
go
an
hour
to
kiss
his
girl
and
half
an
hour
back
and
he
had
my
bike
four
hours
four
hours
and
seven
minutes
i
was
on
the
rings
with
a
fool
of
a
dog
and
sheep
doing
all
they
knew
to
get
the
my
farm
is
a
mystery
to
me
said
the
lady
stroking
her
fingers
some
day
you
must
really
take
me
to
see
it
it
must
be
like
a
gilbert
and
sullivan
opera
with
a
chorus
of
agitated
employers
how
is
it
that
i
have
escaped
why
have
i
never
been
summoned
to
milk
the
cows
or
flay
the
pigs
or
drive
the
young
bullocks
to
the
pasture
he
looked
at
her
with
astonishingly
blue
eyes
the
only
dry
things
he
had
about
him
he
could
not
see
into
her
she
would
have
puzzled
an
older
and
clever
man
he
may
have
seen
round
her
a
thing
of
beauty
you
are
not
but
i
sometimes
think
you
are
a
joy
for
i
beg
your
pardon
oh
you
understand
right
enough
she
exclaimed
irritably
and
then
smiled
for
he
was
conceited
and
did
not
like
being
told
that
he
was
not
a
thing
of
beauty
large
and
steady
feet
she
continued
have
this
disadvantage
you
can
knock
down
a
man
but
you
will
never
knock
down
a
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
i
m
not
likely
oh
never
mind
never
never
mind
i
was
being
funny
i
repent
tell
me
about
the
sheep
why
did
you
go
with
them
i
did
tell
you
i
had
but
why
he
had
to
see
his
but
why
his
eyes
shot
past
her
again
it
was
so
obvious
that
the
man
had
to
see
his
girl
for
two
hours
though
not
for
four
hours
seven
minutes
did
you
have
any
lunch
i
don
t
hold
with
regular
did
you
have
a
book
i
don
t
hold
with
books
in
the
open
none
of
the
older
men
did
you
commune
with
yourself
or
don
t
you
hold
with
that
oh
lord
don
t
ask
me
you
distress
me
you
rob
the
pastoral
of
its
lingering
romance
is
there
no
poetry
and
no
thought
in
england
is
there
no
one
in
all
these
downs
who
warbles
with
eager
thought
the
doric
lay
chaps
sing
to
themselves
at
times
if
you
mean
i
dream
of
arcady
i
open
my
eyes
wiltshire
of
amaryllis
flea
thompson
s
girl
of
the
pensive
shepherd
twitching
his
mantle
blue
you
in
an
ulster
aren
t
you
sorry
for
me
may
i
put
in
a
pipe
by
all
means
put
a
pipe
in
in
return
tell
me
of
what
you
were
thinking
for
the
four
hours
and
the
seven
he
laughed
shyly
you
do
ask
a
man
such
did
you
simply
waste
the
time
i
suppose
i
thought
that
colonel
robert
ingersoll
says
you
must
be
at
the
sound
of
this
name
he
whisked
open
a
little
cupboard
and
declaring
i
haven
t
a
moment
to
spare
took
out
of
it
a
pile
of
clarion
and
other
reprints
adorned
as
to
their
covers
with
bald
or
bearded
apostles
of
humanity
selecting
a
bald
one
he
began
at
once
to
read
occasionally
exclaiming
that
s
got
them
that
s
knocked
genesis
with
similar
ejaculations
of
an
aspiring
mind
she
glanced
at
the
pile
reran
minus
the
style
darwin
minus
the
modesty
a
comic
edition
of
the
book
of
job
by
excelsior
pittsburgh
the
beginning
of
life
with
diagrams
angel
or
ape
by
julia
chunk
she
was
amused
and
wondered
idly
what
was
passing
within
his
narrow
but
not
uninteresting
brain
did
he
suppose
that
he
was
going
to
find
out
she
had
tried
once
herself
but
had
since
subsided
into
a
sprightly
orthodoxy
why
didn
t
he
read
poetry
instead
of
wasting
his
time
between
books
like
these
and
country
like
that
the
cloud
parted
and
the
increase
of
light
made
her
look
up
over
the
valley
she
saw
a
grave
sullen
down
and
on
its
flanks
a
little
brown
smudge
her
sheep
together
with
her
shepherd
fleance
thompson
returned
to
his
duties
at
last
a
trickle
of
water
came
through
the
arbour
roof
she
shrieked
in
dismay
that
s
all
right
said
her
companion
moving
her
chair
but
still
keeping
his
place
in
his
book
she
dried
up
the
spot
on
the
manuscript
then
she
wrote
anthony
eustace
failing
the
subject
of
this
memoir
was
born
at
but
she
wrote
no
more
she
was
fidgety
another
drop
fell
from
the
roof
likewise
an
earwig
she
wished
she
had
not
been
so
playful
in
flinging
her
golosh
into
the
path
the
boy
who
was
overthrowing
religion
breathed
somewhat
heavily
as
he
did
so
another
earwig
she
touched
the
electric
bell
i
m
going
in
she
observed
it
s
far
too
again
the
cloud
parted
and
caused
her
to
add
weren
t
you
rather
kind
to
flea
but
he
was
deep
in
the
book
he
read
like
a
poor
person
with
lips
apart
and
a
finger
that
followed
the
print
at
times
he
scratched
his
ear
or
ran
his
tongue
along
a
straggling
blonde
moustache
his
face
had
after
all
a
certain
beauty
at
all
events
the
colouring
was
regal
a
steady
crimson
from
throat
to
forehead
the
sun
and
the
winds
had
worked
on
him
daily
ever
since
he
was
born
the
face
of
a
strong
man
thought
the
lady
let
him
thank
his
stars
he
isn
t
a
silent
strong
man
or
i
d
turn
him
into
the
suddenly
it
struck
her
that
he
was
like
an
irish
terrier
he
worried
infinity
as
if
it
was
a
bone
gnashing
his
teeth
he
tried
to
carry
the
eternal
subtleties
by
violence
as
a
man
he
often
bored
her
for
he
was
always
saying
and
doing
the
same
things
but
as
a
philosopher
he
really
was
a
joy
for
ever
an
inexhaustible
buffoon
taking
up
her
pen
she
began
to
caricature
him
she
drew
a
where
rabbits
were
at
play
in
four
dimensions
before
she
had
introduced
the
principal
figure
she
was
interrupted
by
the
footman
he
had
come
up
from
the
house
to
answer
the
bell
on
seeing
her
he
uttered
a
respectful
cry
madam
are
you
here
i
am
very
sorry
i
looked
for
you
everywhere
elliot
and
miss
pembroke

an
hour

inquired
after
you
have
they
had
tea
yes
leighton
yes
i
believe
you
knew
she
was
here
all
the
time
you
didn
t
want
to
wet
your
pretty
you
must
not
call
me
she
to
the
servants
said
mrs
failing
as
they
walked
away
she
limping
with
a
stick
he
holding
a
great
umbrella
over
her
i
will
not
have
then
more
pleasantly
and
don
t
tell
him
he
lies
we
all
lie
i
knew
quite
well
they
were
coming
by
the
train
i
saw
it
that
reminds
me
another
child
run
over
at
the
roman
crossing
whish
bang
oh
my
foot
oh
my
foot
my
foot
said
mrs
failing
and
paused
to
take
breath
bad
he
asked
callously
leighton
with
bowed
head
passed
them
with
the
manuscript
and
disappeared
among
the
laurels
the
twinge
of
pain
which
had
been
slight
passed
away
and
they
proceeded
descending
a
green
airless
corridor
which
opened
into
the
gravel
drive
isn
t
it
odd
said
mrs
failing
that
the
greeks
should
be
enthusiastic
about
laurels
that
apollo
should
pursue
any
one
who
could
possibly
turn
into
such
a
frightful
plant
what
do
you
make
of
rickie
oh
i
don
t
shall
i
lend
you
his
story
to
read
he
made
no
reply
don
t
you
think
stephen
that
a
person
in
your
precarious
position
ought
to
be
civil
to
my
relatives
sorry
mrs
failing
i
meant
to
be
civil
i
only
hadn
t
anything
to
she
a
laughed
are
you
a
dear
boy
i
sometimes
wonder
or
are
you
a
brute
again
he
had
nothing
to
say
then
she
laughed
more
mischievously
and
said
how
can
you
be
either
when
you
are
a
philosopher
would
you
mind
telling
me
i
am
so
anxious
to
learn
what
happens
to
people
when
they
die
don
t
ask
he
knew
by
bitter
experience
that
she
was
making
fun
of
him
oh
but
i
do
ask
you
those
paper
books
of
yours
are
so
for
instance
what
has
happened
to
the
child
you
say
was
killed
on
the
line
the
rain
increased
the
drops
pattered
hard
on
the
leaves
and
outside
the
corridor
men
and
women
were
struggling
however
stupidly
with
the
facts
of
life
inside
it
they
wrangled
she
teased
the
boy
and
laughed
at
his
theories
and
proved
that
no
man
can
be
an
agnostic
who
has
a
sense
of
humour
suddenly
she
stopped
not
through
any
skill
of
his
but
because
she
had
remembered
some
words
of
bacon
the
true
atheist
is
he
whose
hands
are
cauterized
by
holy
she
thought
of
her
distant
youth
the
world
was
not
so
humorous
then
but
it
had
been
more
important
for
a
moment
she
respected
her
companion
and
determined
to
vex
him
no
more
they
left
the
shelter
of
the
laurels
crossed
the
broad
drive
and
were
inside
the
house
at
last
she
had
got
quite
wet
for
the
weather
would
not
let
her
play
the
simple
life
with
impunity
as
for
him
he
seemed
a
piece
of
the
wet
look
here
she
cried
as
he
hurried
up
to
his
attic
don
t
shave
he
was
delighted
with
the
permission
i
have
an
idea
that
miss
pembroke
is
of
the
type
that
pretends
to
be
unconventional
and
really
isn
t
i
want
to
see
how
she
takes
it
don
t
in
the
she
could
hear
the
guests
conversing
in
the
subdued
tones
of
those
who
have
not
been
welcomed
having
changed
her
dress
and
glanced
at
the
poems
of
milton
she
went
to
them
with
uplifted
hands
of
apology
and
horror
but
i
must
have
tea
she
announced
when
they
had
assured
her
that
they
understood
otherwise
i
shall
start
by
being
cross
agnes
stop
me
give
me
agnes
looking
pleased
moved
to
the
table
and
served
her
hostess
rickie
followed
with
a
pagoda
of
sandwiches
and
little
cakes
i
feel
years
younger
rickie
you
are
so
like
your
father
i
feel
it
is
years
ago
and
that
he
is
bringing
your
mother
to
see
me
for
the
first
time
it
is
curious
almost
terrible
to
see
history
repeating
the
remark
was
not
tactful
i
remember
that
visit
well
she
continued
thoughtfully
i
suppose
it
was
a
wonderful
visit
though
we
none
of
us
knew
it
at
the
time
we
all
fell
in
love
with
your
mother
i
wish
she
would
have
fallen
in
love
with
us
she
couldn
t
bear
me
could
she
i
never
heard
her
say
so
aunt
no
she
wouldn
t
i
am
sure
your
father
said
so
though
my
dear
boy
don
t
look
so
shocked
your
father
and
i
hated
each
other
he
said
so
i
said
so
i
say
so
say
so
too
then
we
shall
start
just
a
cocoanut
agnes
don
t
you
agree
that
it
s
always
best
to
speak
out
oh
rather
mrs
failing
but
i
m
shockingly
so
am
i
said
the
lady
i
like
to
get
down
to
the
hullo
slippers
slippers
in
the
drawingroom
a
young
man
had
come
in
silently
agnes
observed
with
a
feeling
of
regret
that
he
had
not
shaved
rickie
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
remembered
who
it
was
and
shook
hands
with
him
you
ve
grown
since
i
saw
you
he
showed
his
teeth
amiably
how
long
was
that
asked
mrs
failing
three
years
wasn
t
it
came
over
from
the
ansells
how
disgraceful
rickie
why
don
t
you
come
and
see
me
oftener
he
could
not
retort
that
she
never
asked
him
agnes
will
make
you
come
oh
let
me
introduce
wonham
miss
i
am
deputy
hostess
said
agnes
may
i
give
you
some
tea
thank
you
but
i
have
had
a
little
it
is
one
of
the
shepherds
said
mrs
failing
in
low
tones
agnes
smiled
rather
wildly
lewin
had
warned
her
that
cadover
was
an
extraordinary
place
and
that
one
must
never
be
astonished
at
anything
a
shepherd
in
the
no
harm
still
one
ought
to
know
whether
it
was
a
shepherd
or
not
at
all
events
he
was
in
gentleman
s
clothing
she
was
anxious
not
to
start
with
a
blunder
and
therefore
did
not
talk
to
the
young
fellow
but
tried
to
gather
what
he
was
from
the
demeanour
of
rickie
i
am
sure
mrs
failing
that
you
need
not
talk
of
making
people
come
to
cadover
there
will
be
no
difficulty
i
should
thank
you
my
dear
do
you
know
who
once
said
those
exact
words
to
me
who
rickie
s
did
she
really
my
was
a
dear
you
will
have
heard
rickie
s
praises
but
now
you
must
hear
mine
i
never
knew
a
woman
who
was
so
unselfish
and
yet
had
such
capacities
for
does
one
generally
exclude
the
other
asked
rickie
unselfish
people
as
a
rule
are
deathly
dull
they
have
no
colour
they
think
of
other
people
because
it
is
easier
they
give
money
because
they
are
too
stupid
or
too
idle
to
spend
it
properly
on
themselves
that
was
the
beauty
of
your
mother
she
gave
away
but
she
also
spent
on
herself
or
tried
the
light
faded
out
of
the
in
spite
of
it
being
september
and
only
six
from
her
low
chair
agnes
could
see
the
trees
by
the
drive
black
against
a
blackening
sky
that
drive
was
half
a
mile
long
and
she
was
praising
its
gravelled
surface
when
rickie
called
in
a
voice
of
alarm
i
say
when
did
our
train
arrive
i
said
it
arrived
at
on
the
said
wonham
i
want
to
know
when
it
got
to
the
station
i
tell
you
again
it
was
punctual
i
tell
you
i
looked
at
my
watch
i
can
do
no
agnes
was
amazed
was
rickie
mad
a
minute
ago
and
they
were
boring
each
other
over
dogs
what
had
happened
now
now
quarrelling
already
asked
mrs
failing
the
footman
bringing
a
lamp
lit
up
two
angry
faces
he
says
he
says
he
says
we
ran
over
a
so
you
did
you
ran
over
a
child
in
the
village
at
by
my
watch
your
train
was
late
you
couldn
t
have
got
to
the
station
till
i
don
t
believe
it
we
had
passed
the
village
by
agnes
hadn
t
we
passed
the
village
it
must
have
been
an
express
that
ran
over
the
now
is
it
likely
he
appealed
to
the
practical
world
is
it
likely
that
the
company
would
run
a
stopping
train
and
then
an
express
three
minutes
after
it
a
child
said
rickie
i
can
t
believe
that
the
train
killed
a
he
thought
of
their
journey
they
were
alone
in
the
carriage
as
the
train
slackened
speed
he
had
caught
her
for
a
moment
in
his
arms
the
rain
beat
on
the
windows
but
they
were
in
heaven
you
ve
got
to
believe
it
said
the
other
and
proceeded
to
rub
it
his
healthy
irritable
face
drew
close
to
rickie
s
two
children
were
kicking
and
screaming
on
the
roman
crossing
your
train
being
late
came
down
on
them
one
of
them
was
pulled
off
the
line
but
the
other
was
caught
how
will
you
get
out
of
that
and
how
will
you
get
out
of
it
cried
mrs
failing
turning
the
tables
on
him
where
s
the
child
now
what
has
happened
to
its
soul
you
must
know
agnes
that
this
young
gentleman
is
a
oh
drop
all
that
said
wonham
suddenly
collapsing
drop
it
where
on
my
nice
carpet
i
hate
philosophy
remarked
agnes
trying
to
turn
the
subject
for
she
saw
that
it
made
rickie
unhappy
so
do
i
but
i
daren
t
say
so
before
stephen
he
despises
us
no
i
don
t
said
the
victim
swaying
to
and
fro
on
the
whither
he
had
retreated
yes
he
does
he
won
t
even
trouble
to
answer
us
stephen
podge
answer
me
what
has
happened
to
the
child
s
soul
he
flung
open
the
window
and
leant
from
them
into
the
dusk
they
heard
him
mutter
something
about
a
bridge
what
did
i
tell
you
he
won
t
answer
my
the
delightful
moment
was
approaching
when
the
boy
would
lose
his
temper
she
knew
it
by
a
certain
tremor
in
his
heels
there
wants
a
bridge
he
exploded
a
bridge
instead
of
all
this
rotten
talk
and
the
it
wouldn
t
break
you
to
build
a
bridge
then
the
child
s
soul
as
you
call
it
well
nothing
would
have
happened
to
the
child
at
a
gust
of
night
air
entered
accompanied
by
rain
the
flowers
in
the
vases
rustled
and
the
flame
of
the
lamp
shot
up
and
smoked
the
glass
slightly
irritated
she
ordered
him
to
close
the
window
xi
cadover
was
not
a
large
house
but
it
is
the
largest
house
with
which
this
story
has
dealings
and
must
always
be
thought
of
with
respect
it
was
built
about
the
year
and
favoured
the
architecture
of
ancient
rome
chiefly
by
means
of
five
lank
pilasters
which
stretched
from
the
top
of
it
to
the
bottom
between
the
pilasters
was
the
glass
front
door
to
the
right
of
them
the
drawing
room
windows
to
the
left
of
them
the
windows
of
the
above
them
a
triangular
area
which
the
servants
knew
as
a
pendiment
and
which
had
in
its
middle
a
small
round
hole
according
to
the
usage
of
palladio
the
classical
note
was
also
sustained
by
eight
grey
steps
which
led
from
the
building
down
into
the
drive
and
by
an
attempt
at
a
formal
garden
on
the
adjoining
lawn
the
lawn
ended
in
a
ha
ha
who
shall
regard
it
and
thence
the
bare
land
sloped
down
into
the
village
the
main
garden
walled
was
to
the
left
as
one
faced
the
house
while
to
the
right
was
that
laurel
avenue
leading
up
to
failing
s
arbour
it
was
a
comfortable
but
not
very
attractive
place
and
to
a
certain
type
of
mind
its
situation
was
not
attractive
either
from
the
distance
it
showed
as
a
grey
box
huddled
against
evergreens
there
was
no
mystery
about
it
you
saw
it
for
miles
its
hill
had
none
of
the
beetling
romance
of
devonshire
none
of
the
subtle
contours
that
prelude
a
cottage
in
kent
but
profferred
its
burden
crudely
on
a
huge
bare
palm
there
s
cadover
visitors
would
say
how
small
it
still
looks
we
shall
be
late
for
and
the
view
from
the
windows
though
extensive
would
not
have
been
accepted
by
the
royal
academy
a
valley
containing
a
stream
a
road
a
railway
over
the
valley
fields
of
barley
and
wurzel
divided
by
no
pretty
hedges
and
passing
into
a
great
and
formless
down
this
was
the
outlook
desolate
at
all
times
and
almost
terrifying
beneath
a
cloudy
sky
the
down
was
called
cadbury
range
cocoa
squares
if
you
were
young
and
funny
because
high
upon
it
one
can
not
say
on
the
top
there
being
scarcely
any
tops
in
wiltshire
because
high
upon
it
there
stood
a
double
circle
of
entrenchments
a
bank
of
grass
enclosed
a
ring
of
turnips
which
enclosed
a
second
bank
of
grass
which
enclosed
more
turnips
and
in
the
middle
of
the
pattern
grew
one
small
tree

the
competent
reader
will
decide
the
thompson
family
knew
it
to
be
far
older
than
the
war
it
was
the
property
of
government
it
was
full
of
gold
and
dead
soldiers
who
had
fought
with
the
soldiers
on
castle
rings
and
been
beaten
the
road
to
londinium
having
forded
the
stream
and
crossed
the
valley
road
and
the
railway
passed
up
by
these
entrenchments
the
road
to
london
lay
half
a
mile
to
the
right
of
them
to
complete
this
survey
one
must
mention
the
church
and
the
farm
both
of
which
lay
over
the
stream
in
cadford
between
them
they
ruled
the
village
one
claiming
the
souls
of
the
labourers
the
other
their
bodies
if
a
man
desired
other
religion
or
other
employment
he
must
leave
the
church
lay
up
by
the
railway
the
farm
was
down
by
the
water
meadows
the
vicar
a
gentle
charitable
man
scarcely
realized
his
power
and
never
tried
to
abuse
it
wilbraham
the
agent
was
of
another
mould
he
knew
his
place
and
kept
others
to
theirs
all
society
seemed
spread
before
him
like
a
map
the
line
between
the
county
and
the
local
the
line
between
the
labourer
and
the
artisan
he
knew
them
all
and
strengthened
them
with
no
uncertain
touch
everything
with
him
was
graduated
carefully
graduated
civility
towards
his
superior
towards
his
inferiors
carefully
graduated
incivility
so
for
he
was
a
thoughtful
person
so
alone
declared
he
could
things
be
kept
together
perhaps
the
comic
muse
to
whom
so
much
is
now
attributed
had
caused
his
estate
to
be
left
to
mr
failing
mr
failing
was
the
author
of
some
brilliant
books
on
socialism
that
was
why
his
wife
married
him
and
for
years
he
reigned
up
at
cadover
and
tried
to
put
his
theories
into
practice
he
believed
that
things
could
be
kept
together
by
accenting
the
similarities
not
the
differences
of
men
we
are
all
much
more
alike
than
we
confess
was
one
of
his
favourite
speeches
as
a
speech
it
sounded
very
well
and
his
wife
had
applauded
but
when
it
resulted
in
hard
work
evenings
in
the
and
long
unobtrusive
talks
with
dull
people
she
got
bored
in
her
piquant
way
she
declared
that
she
was
not
going
to
love
her
husband
and
succeeded
he
took
it
quietly
but
his
brilliancy
decreased
his
health
grew
worse
and
he
knew
that
when
he
died
there
was
no
one
to
carry
on
his
work
he
felt
besides
that
he
had
done
very
little
toil
as
he
would
he
had
not
a
practical
mind
and
could
never
dispense
with
wilbraham
for
all
his
tact
he
would
often
stretch
out
the
hand
of
brotherhood
too
soon
or
withhold
it
when
it
would
have
been
accepted
most
people
misunderstood
him
or
only
understood
him
when
he
was
dead
in
after
years
his
reign
became
a
golden
age
but
he
counted
a
few
disciples
in
his
a
few
young
labourers
and
tenant
farmers
who
swore
tempestuously
that
he
was
not
really
a
fool
this
he
told
himself
was
as
much
as
he
deserved
cadover
was
inherited
by
his
widow
she
tried
to
sell
it
she
tried
to
let
it
but
she
asked
too
much
and
as
it
was
neither
a
pretty
place
nor
fertile
it
was
left
on
her
hands
with
many
a
groan
she
settled
down
to
banishment
wiltshire
people
she
declared
were
the
stupidest
in
england
she
told
them
so
to
their
faces
which
made
them
no
brighter
and
their
county
was
worthy
of
them
no
distinction
in
it
no
style
simply
land
but
her
wrath
passed
or
remained
only
as
a
graceful
fretfulness
she
made
the
house
comfortable
and
abandoned
the
farm
to
wilbraham
with
a
good
deal
of
care
she
selected
a
small
circle
of
acquaintances
and
had
them
to
stop
in
the
summer
months
in
the
winter
she
would
go
to
town
and
frequent
the
salons
of
the
literary
as
her
lameness
increased
she
moved
about
less
and
at
the
time
of
her
nephew
s
visit
seldom
left
the
place
that
had
been
forced
upon
her
as
a
home
just
now
she
was
busy
a
prominent
politician
had
quoted
her
husband
the
young
generation
asked
who
is
this
mr
failing
and
the
publishers
wrote
now
is
the
she
was
collecting
some
essays
and
penning
an
introductory
memoir
rickie
admired
his
aunt
but
did
not
care
for
her
she
reminded
him
too
much
of
his
father
she
had
the
same
affliction
the
same
heartlessness
the
same
habit
of
taking
life
with
a
laugh
as
if
life
is
a
pill
he
also
felt
that
she
had
neglected
him
he
would
not
have
asked
much
as
for
prospects
they
never
entered
his
head
but
she
was
his
only
near
relative
and
a
little
kindness
and
hospitality
during
the
lonely
years
would
have
made
incalculable
difference
now
that
he
was
happier
and
could
bring
her
agnes
she
had
asked
him
to
stop
at
once
the
sun
as
it
rose
next
morning
spoke
to
him
of
a
new
life
he
too
had
a
purpose
and
a
value
in
the
world
at
last
leaning
out
of
the
window
he
gazed
at
the
earth
washed
clean
and
heard
through
the
pure
air
the
distant
noises
of
the
farm
but
that
day
nothing
was
to
remain
divine
but
the
weather
his
aunt
for
reasons
of
her
own
decreed
that
he
should
go
for
a
ride
with
the
wonham
boy
they
were
to
look
at
old
sarum
proceed
thence
to
salisbury
lunch
there
see
the
sights
call
on
a
certain
canon
for
tea
and
return
to
cadover
in
the
evening
the
arrangement
suited
no
one
he
did
not
want
to
ride
but
to
be
with
agnes
nor
did
agnes
want
to
be
parted
from
him
nor
stephen
to
go
with
him
but
the
clearer
the
wishes
of
her
guests
became
the
more
determined
was
mrs
failing
to
disregard
them
she
smoothed
away
every
difficulty
she
converted
every
objection
into
a
reason
and
she
ordered
the
horses
for
nine
it
is
a
bore
he
grumbled
as
he
sat
in
their
little
private
breaking
his
upon
the
coachman
s
gaiters
i
can
t
ride
i
shall
fall
off
we
should
have
been
so
happy
here
it
s
just
like
aunt
emily
can
t
you
imagine
her
saying
afterwards
lovers
are
absurd
i
made
a
point
of
keeping
them
apart
and
then
everybody
with
a
pretty
foretaste
of
the
future
agnes
knelt
before
him
and
did
the
gaiters
up
who
is
this
wonham
by
the
bye
i
don
t
know
some
connection
of
failing
s
i
does
he
live
here
he
used
to
be
at
school
or
something
he
seems
to
have
grown
into
a
tiresome
i
suppose
that
mrs
failing
has
adopted
i
suppose
so
i
believe
that
she
has
been
quite
kind
i
do
hope
she
ll
be
kind
to
you
this
morning
i
hate
leaving
you
with
why
you
say
she
likes
yes
but
that
wouldn
t
prevent
you
see
she
doesn
t
mind
what
she
says
or
what
she
repeats
if
it
amuses
her
if
she
thought
it
really
funny
for
instance
to
break
off
our
engagement
she
d
dear
boy
what
a
frightful
remark
but
it
would
be
funnier
for
us
to
see
her
trying
whatever
could
she
do
he
kissed
the
hands
that
were
still
busy
with
the
fastenings
nothing
i
can
t
see
one
thing
we
simply
lie
open
to
each
other
you
and
i
there
isn
t
one
new
corner
in
either
of
us
that
she
could
reveal
it
s
only
that
i
always
have
in
this
house
the
most
awful
feeling
of
why
if
any
one
says
or
does
a
foolish
thing
it
s
always
here
all
the
family
breezes
have
started
here
it
s
a
kind
of
focus
for
aimed
and
aimless
scandal
you
know
when
my
father
and
mother
had
their
special
quarrel
my
aunt
was
mixed
up
in
it
i
never
knew
how
or
how
much
but
you
may
be
sure
she
didn
t
calm
things
down
unless
she
found
things
more
entertaining
rickie
rickie
cried
the
lady
from
the
garden
your
s
we
really
oughtn
t
to
talk
of
her
like
this
here
whispered
agnes
it
s
a
horrible
the
habit
of
the
country
agnes
ugh
this
gossip
suddenly
he
flung
his
arms
over
her
dear
dear
let
s
beware
of
i
don
t
know
what
of
nothing
at
all
oh
buck
up
yelled
the
irritable
stephen
which
am
i
to
shorten
left
stirrup
or
right
left
shouted
agnes
how
many
holes
they
hurried
down
on
the
way
she
said
i
m
glad
of
the
warning
now
i
m
prepared
your
aunt
will
get
nothing
out
of
her
betrothed
tried
to
mount
with
the
wrong
foot
according
to
his
invariable
custom
she
also
had
to
pick
up
his
whip
at
last
they
started
the
boy
showing
off
pretty
consistently
and
she
was
left
alone
with
her
hostess
dido
is
quiet
as
a
lamb
said
mrs
failing
and
stephen
is
a
good
fielder
what
a
blessing
it
is
to
have
cleared
out
the
men
what
shall
you
and
i
do
this
heavenly
morning
i
m
game
for
have
you
quite
unpacked
any
letters
to
write
no
then
let
s
go
to
my
arbour
no
we
won
t
it
gets
the
morning
sun
and
it
ll
be
too
hot
already
she
regretted
clearing
out
the
men
on
such
a
morning
she
would
have
liked
to
drive
but
her
third
animal
had
gone
lame
she
feared
too
that
miss
pembroke
was
going
to
bore
her
however
they
did
go
to
the
arbour
in
languid
tones
she
pointed
out
the
various
objects
of
interest
there
s
the
cad
which
goes
into
the
something
which
goes
into
the
avon
cadbury
rings
opposite
cadchurch
to
the
extreme
left
you
can
t
see
it
you
were
there
last
night
it
is
famous
for
the
drunken
parson
and
the
then
cad
dauntsey
then
cadford
that
side
of
the
stream
connected
with
cadover
this
observe
the
fertility
of
the
wiltshire
a
terrible
lot
of
cads
said
agnes
brightly
mrs
failing
divided
her
guests
into
those
who
made
this
joke
and
those
who
did
not
the
latter
class
was
very
small
the
vicar
of
cadford
not
the
nice
drunkard
declares
the
name
is
really
chadford
and
he
worried
on
till
i
put
up
a
window
to
chad
in
our
church
his
cambridge
wife
pronounces
it
i
could
smack
them
both
how
do
you
like
podge
ah
you
jump
i
meant
you
to
how
do
you
like
podge
wonham
very
nice
said
agnes
laughing
nice
he
is
a
there
was
a
long
interval
of
silence
each
lady
looked
without
much
interest
at
the
view
failing
s
attitude
towards
nature
was
severely
aesthetic
an
attitude
more
sterile
than
the
severely
practical
she
applied
the
test
of
beauty
to
shadow
and
odour
and
sound
they
never
filled
her
with
reverence
or
excitement
she
never
knew
them
as
a
resistless
trinity
that
may
intoxicate
the
worshipper
with
joy
if
she
liked
a
ploughed
field
it
was
only
as
a
spot
of
colour
not
also
as
a
hint
of
the
endless
strength
of
the
earth
and
today
she
could
approve
of
one
cloud
but
object
to
its
fellow
as
for
miss
pembroke
she
was
not
approving
or
objecting
at
all
a
hero
she
queried
when
the
interval
had
passed
her
voice
was
indifferent
as
if
she
had
been
thinking
of
other
things
a
hero
yes
didn
t
you
notice
how
heroic
he
was
i
don
t
think
i
not
at
dinner
ah
agnes
always
look
out
for
heroism
at
dinner
it
is
their
great
time
they
live
up
to
the
stiffness
of
their
shirt
fronts
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
never
noticed
how
he
set
down
rickie
oh
that
about
poetry
said
agnes
laughing
rickie
would
not
mind
it
for
a
moment
but
why
do
you
single
out
that
as
heroic
to
snub
people
to
set
them
down
to
be
rude
to
them
to
make
them
feel
small
surely
that
s
the
lifework
of
a
hero
i
shouldn
t
have
said
that
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
wonham
was
wrong
over
the
poetry
i
made
rickie
look
it
up
but
of
course
a
hero
always
is
to
me
she
persisted
rather
gently
a
hero
has
always
been
a
strong
wonderful
being
who
champions
ah
wait
till
you
are
the
dragon
i
have
been
a
dragon
most
of
my
life
i
think
a
dragon
that
wants
nothing
but
a
peaceful
cave
then
in
comes
the
strong
wonderful
delightful
being
and
gains
a
princess
by
piercing
my
hide
no
seriously
my
dear
agnes
the
chief
characteristics
of
a
hero
are
infinite
disregard
for
the
feelings
of
others
plus
general
inability
to
understand
but
surely
wonham
yes
aren
t
we
being
unkind
to
the
poor
boy
ought
we
to
go
on
talking
agnes
waited
remembering
the
warnings
of
rickie
and
thinking
that
anything
she
said
might
perhaps
be
repeated
though
even
if
he
was
here
he
wouldn
t
understand
what
we
are
wouldn
t
understand
mrs
failing
gave
the
least
flicker
of
an
eye
towards
her
companion
did
you
take
him
for
clever
i
don
t
think
i
took
him
for
she
smiled
i
have
been
thinking
of
other
things
and
another
but
do
think
for
a
moment
of
stephen
i
will
describe
how
he
spent
yesterday
he
rose
at
eight
from
eight
to
eleven
he
sang
the
song
was
called
father
s
boots
will
soon
fit
he
stopped
once
to
say
to
the
footman
she
ll
never
finish
her
book
she
idles
she
being
i
at
eleven
he
went
out
and
stood
in
the
rain
till
four
but
had
the
luck
to
see
a
child
run
over
at
the
by
four
he
had
knocked
the
bottom
out
of
agnes
looked
bewildered
aren
t
you
impressed
i
was
i
told
him
that
he
was
on
no
account
to
unsettle
the
vicar
open
that
cupboard
one
of
those
sixpenny
books
tells
podge
that
he
s
made
of
hard
little
black
things
another
that
he
s
made
of
brown
things
larger
and
squashy
there
seems
a
discrepancy
but
anything
is
better
for
a
thoughtful
youth
than
to
be
made
in
the
garden
of
eden
let
us
eliminate
the
poetic
at
whatever
cost
to
the
when
for
a
moment
she
spoke
more
gravely
here
he
is
at
twenty
with
nothing
to
hold
on
by
i
don
t
know
what
s
to
be
done
i
suppose
it
s
my
fault
but
i
ve
never
had
any
bother
over
the
church
of
england
have
you
of
course
i
go
with
my
church
said
miss
pembroke
who
hated
this
style
of
conversation
i
don
t
know
i
m
sure
i
think
you
should
consult
a
would
rickie
help
me
rickie
would
do
anything
he
and
mrs
failing
noted
the
half
official
way
in
which
she
vouched
for
her
lover
but
of
course
rickie
is
a
little
complicated
i
doubt
whether
wonham
would
understand
him
he
wants
doesn
t
he
some
one
who
s
a
little
more
assertive
and
more
accustomed
to
boys
some
one
more
like
my
agnes
she
seized
her
by
the
arm
do
you
suppose
that
pembroke
would
undertake
my
podge
she
shook
her
head
his
time
is
so
filled
up
he
gets
a
next
term
besides
after
all
i
don
t
know
what
herbert
would
morality
he
would
teach
him
morality
the
articles
may
come
of
themselves
but
if
you
have
no
morals
you
come
to
grief
morality
is
all
i
demand
from
herbert
pembroke
he
shall
be
excused
the
use
of
the
globes
you
know
of
course
that
stephen
s
expelled
from
a
public
school
he
the
school
was
not
a
public
one
and
the
expulsion
or
rather
request
for
removal
had
taken
place
when
stephen
was
fourteen
a
violent
spasm
of
dishonesty
such
as
often
heralds
the
approach
of
manhood
had
overcome
him
he
stole
everything
especially
what
was
difficult
to
steal
and
hid
the
plunder
beneath
a
loose
plank
in
the
passage
he
was
betrayed
by
the
inclusion
of
a
ham
this
was
the
crisis
of
his
career
his
benefactress
was
just
then
rather
bored
with
him
he
had
stopped
being
a
pretty
boy
and
she
rather
doubted
whether
she
would
see
him
through
but
she
was
so
raged
with
the
letters
of
the
schoolmaster
and
so
delighted
with
those
of
the
criminal
that
she
had
him
back
and
gave
him
a
prize
no
said
agnes
i
didn
t
know
i
should
be
happy
to
speak
to
herbert
but
as
i
said
his
time
will
be
very
full
but
i
know
he
has
friends
who
make
a
speciality
of
weakly
or
or
unusual
my
dear
i
ve
tried
it
stephen
kicked
the
weakly
boys
and
robbed
apples
with
the
unusual
ones
he
was
expelled
agnes
began
to
find
mrs
failing
rather
tiresome
wherever
you
trod
on
her
she
seemed
to
slip
away
from
beneath
your
feet
agnes
liked
to
know
where
she
was
and
where
other
people
were
as
well
she
said
my
brother
thinks
a
great
deal
of
home
life
i
daresay
he
d
think
that
wonham
is
best
where
he
is
with
you
you
have
been
so
kind
to
him
you
she
paused
have
been
to
him
both
father
and
i
m
too
hot
was
failing
s
reply
it
seemed
that
miss
pembroke
had
at
last
touched
a
topic
on
which
she
was
reticent
she
rang
the
electric
bell
it
was
only
to
tell
the
footman
to
take
the
reprints
to
wonham
s
room
and
then
murmuring
something
about
work
proceeded
herself
to
the
house
mrs
failing
said
agnes
who
had
not
expected
such
a
speedy
end
to
their
chat
call
me
aunt
emily
my
dear
aunt
emily
what
did
you
think
of
that
story
rickie
sent
you
it
is
bad
said
mrs
failing
but
but
then
she
escaped
having
told
the
truth
and
yet
leaving
a
pleasurable
impression
behind
her
xii
the
excursion
to
salisbury
was
but
a
poor
business
in
fact
rickie
never
got
there
they
were
not
out
of
the
drive
before
wonham
began
doing
acrobatics
he
showed
rickie
how
very
quickly
he
could
turn
round
in
his
saddle
and
sit
with
his
face
to
aeneas
s
tail
i
see
said
rickie
coldly
and
became
almost
cross
when
they
arrived
in
this
condition
at
the
gate
behind
the
house
for
he
had
to
open
it
and
was
afraid
of
falling
as
usual
he
anchored
just
beyond
the
fastenings
and
then
had
to
turn
dido
who
seemed
as
long
as
a
battleship
to
his
relief
a
man
came
forward
and
murmuring
worst
gate
in
the
parish
pushed
it
wide
and
held
it
respectfully
thank
you
cried
rickie
many
but
stephen
who
was
riding
into
the
world
back
first
said
majestically
no
no
it
doesn
t
count
you
needn
t
think
it
does
you
make
it
worse
by
touching
your
hat
four
hours
and
seven
minutes
you
ll
see
me
the
man
answered
nothing
eh
but
i
ll
hurt
him
he
chanted
as
he
swung
into
position
that
was
flea
eh
but
he
s
forgotten
my
fists
eh
but
i
ll
hurt
why
ventured
rickie
last
night
over
cigarettes
he
had
been
bored
to
death
by
the
story
of
flea
the
boy
had
a
little
reminded
him
of
gerald
the
gerald
of
history
not
the
gerald
of
romance
he
was
more
genial
but
there
was
the
same
brutality
the
same
peevish
insistence
on
the
pound
of
flesh
hurt
him
till
he
learns
what
learns
of
course
retorted
stephen
neither
of
them
was
very
civil
they
did
not
dislike
each
other
but
they
each
wanted
to
be
somewhere
else
exactly
the
situation
that
mrs
failing
had
expected
he
behaved
badly
said
rickie
because
he
is
poorer
than
we
are
and
more
ignorant
less
money
has
been
spent
on
teaching
him
to
well
i
ll
teach
him
for
perhaps
his
fists
are
stronger
than
yours
they
aren
t
i
after
this
conversation
flagged
rickie
glanced
back
at
cadover
and
thought
of
the
insipid
day
that
lay
before
him
generally
he
was
attracted
by
fresh
people
and
stephen
was
almost
fresh
they
had
been
to
him
symbols
of
the
unknown
and
all
that
they
did
was
interesting
but
now
he
cared
for
the
unknown
no
longer
he
knew
wilbraham
passed
them
in
his
and
lifted
his
hat
to
his
employer
s
nephew
stephen
he
ignored
he
could
not
find
him
on
the
map
good
morning
said
rickie
what
a
lovely
morning
i
say
called
the
other
another
child
dead
wilbraham
who
had
seemed
inclined
to
chat
whipped
up
his
horse
and
left
them
there
goes
an
out
and
outer
said
stephen
and
then
as
if
introducing
an
entirely
new
subject
don
t
you
think
flea
thompson
treated
me
disgracefully
i
suppose
he
did
but
i
m
scarcely
the
person
to
the
allusion
fell
flat
and
he
had
to
explain
it
i
should
have
done
the
same
myself
promised
to
be
away
two
hours
and
stopped
oh
i
understand
you
being
in
love
you
mean
he
smiled
and
nodded
oh
i
ve
no
objection
to
flea
loving
he
says
he
can
t
help
it
but
as
long
as
my
fists
are
stronger
he
s
got
to
keep
it
in
in
line
a
man
like
that
when
he
s
got
a
girl
thinks
the
rest
can
go
to
the
devil
he
goes
cutting
his
work
and
breaking
his
word
wilbraham
ought
to
sack
him
i
promise
you
when
i
ve
a
girl
i
ll
keep
her
in
line
and
if
she
turns
nasty
i
ll
get
rickie
smiled
and
said
no
more
but
he
was
sorry
that
any
one
should
start
life
with
such
a
creed
all
the
more
sorry
because
the
creed
caricatured
his
own
he
too
believed
that
life
should
be
in
a
line
a
line
of
enormous
length
full
of
countless
interests
and
countless
figures
all
well
beloved
but
woman
was
not
to
be
kept
to
this
line
rather
did
she
advance
it
continually
like
some
triumphant
general
making
each
unit
still
more
interesting
still
more
lovable
than
it
had
been
before
he
loved
agnes
not
only
for
herself
but
because
she
was
lighting
up
the
human
world
but
he
could
scarcely
explain
this
to
an
inexperienced
animal
nor
did
he
make
the
attempt
for
a
long
time
they
proceeded
in
silence
the
hill
behind
cadover
was
in
harvest
and
the
horses
moved
regretfully
between
the
sheaves
stephen
had
picked
a
grass
leaf
and
was
blowing
catcalls
upon
it
he
blew
very
well
and
this
morning
all
his
soul
went
into
the
wail
for
he
was
ill
he
was
tortured
with
the
feeling
that
he
could
not
get
away
and
do
do
something
instead
of
being
civil
to
this
anaemic
prig
four
hours
in
the
rain
was
better
than
this
he
had
not
wanted
to
fidget
in
the
rain
but
now
the
air
was
like
wine
and
the
stubble
was
smelling
of
wet
and
over
his
head
white
clouds
trundled
more
slowly
and
more
seldom
through
broadening
tracts
of
blue
there
never
had
been
such
a
morning
and
he
shut
up
his
eyes
and
called
to
it
and
whenever
he
called
rickie
shut
up
his
eyes
and
winced
at
last
the
blade
broke
we
don
t
go
quick
do
we
he
remarked
and
looked
on
the
weedy
track
for
another
i
wish
you
wouldn
t
let
me
keep
you
if
you
were
alone
you
would
be
galloping
or
something
of
that
i
was
told
i
must
go
your
pace
he
said
mournfully
and
you
promised
miss
pembroke
not
to
well
i
ll
but
he
could
not
rise
above
a
gentle
trot
and
even
that
nearly
jerked
him
out
of
the
saddle
sit
like
this
said
stephen
can
t
you
see
like
this
rickie
lurched
forward
and
broke
his
thumb
nail
on
the
horse
s
neck
it
bled
a
little
and
had
to
be
bound
up
thank
you
awfully
kind
no
tighter
please
i
m
simply
spoiling
your
i
can
t
think
how
a
man
can
help
riding
you
ve
only
to
leave
it
to
the
horse
so
so
just
as
you
leave
it
to
water
in
rickie
left
it
to
dido
who
stopped
immediately
i
said
leave
his
voice
rose
irritably
i
didn
t
say
of
course
she
stops
if
you
die
first
you
sit
her
as
if
you
re
sandow
exercising
and
then
you
sit
like
a
corpse
can
t
you
tell
her
you
re
alive
that
s
all
she
in
trying
to
convey
the
information
rickie
dropped
his
whip
stephen
picked
it
up
and
rammed
it
into
the
belt
of
his
own
norfolk
jacket
he
was
scarcely
a
fashionable
horseman
he
was
not
even
graceful
but
he
rode
as
a
living
man
though
rickie
was
too
much
bored
to
notice
it
not
a
muscle
in
him
was
idle
not
a
muscle
working
hard
when
he
returned
from
the
gallop
his
limbs
were
still
unsatisfied
and
his
manners
still
irritable
he
did
not
know
that
he
was
ill
he
knew
nothing
about
himself
at
all
like
a
howdah
in
the
zoo
he
grumbled
mother
failing
will
buy
and
he
proceeded
to
criticize
his
benefactress
rickie
keenly
alive
to
bad
taste
tried
to
stop
him
and
gained
instead
a
criticism
of
religion
stephen
overthrew
the
mosaic
cosmogony
he
pointed
out
the
discrepancies
in
the
gospels
he
levelled
his
wit
against
the
most
beautiful
spire
in
the
world
now
rising
against
the
southern
sky
between
whiles
he
went
for
a
gallop
after
a
time
rickie
stopped
listening
and
simply
went
his
way
for
dido
was
a
perfect
mount
and
as
indifferent
to
the
motions
of
aeneas
as
if
she
was
strolling
in
the
elysian
fields
he
had
had
a
bad
night
and
the
strong
air
made
him
sleepy
the
wind
blew
from
the
plain
cadover
and
its
valley
had
disappeared
and
though
they
had
not
climbed
much
and
could
not
see
far
there
was
a
sense
of
infinite
space
the
fields
were
enormous
like
fields
on
the
continent
and
the
brilliant
sun
showed
up
their
colours
well
the
green
of
the
turnips
the
gold
of
the
harvest
and
the
brown
of
the
newly
turned
clods
were
each
contrasted
with
morsels
of
grey
down
but
the
general
effect
was
pale
or
rather
silvery
for
wiltshire
is
not
a
county
of
heavy
tints
beneath
these
colours
lurked
the
unconquerable
chalk
and
wherever
the
soil
was
poor
it
emerged
the
grassy
track
so
gay
with
scabious
and
bedstraw
was
at
the
bottom
of
its
ruts
a
dazzling
amphitheatre
gleamed
in
the
flank
of
a
distant
hill
cut
for
some
olympian
audience
and
here
and
there
whatever
the
surface
crop
the
earth
broke
into
little
embankments
little
ditches
little
mounds
there
had
been
no
lack
of
drama
to
solace
the
gods
in
cadover
the
perilous
house
agnes
had
already
parted
from
mrs
failing
his
thoughts
returned
to
her
was
she
the
soul
of
truth
in
safety
was
her
purity
vexed
by
the
lies
and
selfishness
would
she
elude
the
caprice
which
had
he
vaguely
knew
caused
suffering
before
ah
the
frailty
of
joy
ah
the
myriads
of
longings
that
pass
without
fruition
and
the
turf
grows
over
them
better
men
women
as
noble
they
had
died
up
here
and
their
dust
had
been
mingled
but
only
their
dust
these
are
morbid
thoughts
but
who
dare
contradict
them
there
is
much
good
luck
in
the
world
but
it
is
luck
we
are
none
of
us
safe
we
are
children
playing
or
quarreling
on
the
line
and
some
of
us
have
rickie
s
temperament
or
his
experiences
and
admit
it
so
he
mused
that
anxious
little
speck
and
all
the
land
seemed
to
comment
on
his
fears
and
on
his
love
their
path
lay
upward
over
a
great
bald
skull
half
grass
half
stubble
it
seemed
each
moment
there
would
be
a
splendid
view
the
view
never
came
for
none
of
the
inclines
were
sharp
enough
and
they
moved
over
the
skull
for
many
minutes
scarcely
shifting
a
landmark
or
altering
the
blue
fringe
of
the
distance
the
spire
of
salisbury
did
alter
but
very
slightly
rising
and
falling
like
the
mercury
in
a
thermometer
at
the
most
it
would
be
half
hidden
at
the
least
the
tip
would
show
behind
the
swelling
barrier
of
earth
they
passed
two
a
great
event
the
bare
patch
said
stephen
was
owing
to
the
gallows
rickie
nodded
he
had
lost
all
sense
of
incident
in
this
great
solitude
more
solitary
than
any
alpine
range
he
and
agnes
were
floating
alone
and
for
ever
between
the
shapeless
earth
and
the
shapeless
clouds
an
immense
silence
seemed
to
move
towards
them
a
lark
stopped
singing
and
they
were
glad
of
it
they
were
approaching
the
throne
of
god
the
silence
touched
them
the
earth
and
all
danger
dissolved
but
ere
they
quite
vanished
rickie
heard
himself
saying
is
it
exactly
what
we
intended
yes
said
a
man
s
voice
it
s
the
old
they
were
in
another
valley
its
sides
were
thick
with
trees
down
it
ran
another
stream
and
another
road
it
too
sheltered
a
string
of
villages
but
all
was
richer
larger
and
more
beautiful
the
valley
of
the
avon
below
amesbury
i
ve
been
asleep
said
rickie
in
awestruck
tones
never
said
the
other
facetiously
pleasant
dreams
perhaps
i
m
really
tired
of
apologizing
to
you
how
long
have
you
been
holding
me
on
all
in
the
day
s
he
gave
him
back
the
reins
where
s
that
round
hill
gone
where
the
good
niggers
go
i
want
a
this
is
nature
s
joke
in
wiltshire
her
one
joke
you
toil
on
windy
slopes
and
feel
very
primeval
you
are
miles
from
your
fellows
and
lo
a
little
valley
full
of
elms
and
cottages
before
rickie
had
waked
up
to
it
they
had
stopped
by
a
thatched
and
stephen
was
yelling
like
a
maniac
for
beer
there
was
no
occasion
to
yell
he
was
not
very
thirsty
and
they
were
quite
ready
to
serve
him
nor
need
he
have
drunk
in
the
saddle
with
the
air
of
a
warrior
who
carries
important
dispatches
and
has
not
the
time
to
dismount
a
real
soldier
bound
on
a
similar
errand
rode
up
to
the
inn
and
stephen
feared
that
he
would
yell
louder
and
was
hostile
but
they
made
friends
and
treated
each
other
and
slanged
the
proprietor
and
ragged
the
pretty
girls
while
rickie
as
each
wave
of
vulgarity
burst
over
him
sunk
his
head
lower
and
lower
and
wished
that
the
earth
would
swallow
him
up
he
was
only
used
to
cambridge
and
to
a
very
small
corner
of
that
he
and
his
friends
there
believed
in
free
speech
but
they
spoke
freely
about
generalities
they
were
scientific
and
philosophic
they
would
have
shrunk
from
the
empirical
freedom
that
results
from
a
little
beer
that
was
what
annoyed
him
as
he
rode
down
the
new
valley
with
two
chattering
companions
he
was
more
skilled
than
they
were
in
the
principles
of
human
existence
but
he
was
not
so
indecently
familiar
with
the
examples
a
sordid
village
scandal
such
as
stephen
described
as
a
huge
joke
sprang
from
certain
defects
in
human
nature
with
which
he
was
theoretically
acquainted
but
the
example
he
blushed
at
it
like
a
maiden
lady
in
spite
of
its
having
a
parallel
in
a
beautiful
idyll
of
theocritus
was
experience
going
to
be
such
a
splendid
thing
after
all
were
the
outside
of
houses
so
very
beautiful
that
s
spicy
the
soldier
was
saying
got
any
more
like
that
i
se
got
a
pome
said
stephen
and
drew
a
piece
of
paper
from
his
pocket
the
valley
had
broadened
old
sarum
rose
before
them
ugly
and
majestic
write
this
yourself
he
asked
chuckling
rather
said
stephen
lowering
his
head
and
kissing
aeneas
between
the
ears
but
who
s
old
em
ly
rickie
winced
and
frowned
now
you
re
asking
old
em
ly
she
limps
and
as
i
am
so
tired
said
rickie
why
should
he
stand
it
any
longer
he
would
go
home
to
the
woman
he
loved
do
you
mind
if
i
give
up
salisbury
but
we
ve
seen
nothing
cried
stephen
i
shouldn
t
enjoy
anything
i
am
so
absurdly
left
turn
then
all
in
the
day
s
he
bit
at
his
moustache
angrily
good
gracious
me
man
of
course
i
m
going
back
alone
i
m
not
going
to
spoil
your
day
how
could
you
think
it
of
me
stephen
gave
a
loud
sigh
of
relief
if
you
do
want
to
go
home
here
s
your
whip
don
t
fall
off
say
to
her
you
wanted
it
or
there
might
be
certainly
thank
you
for
your
kind
care
of
old
em
ly
she
limps
and
as
soon
he
was
out
of
earshot
soon
they
were
lost
to
view
soon
they
were
out
of
his
thoughts
he
forgot
the
coarseness
and
the
drinking
and
the
ingratitude
a
few
months
ago
he
would
not
have
forgotten
so
quickly
and
he
might
also
have
detected
something
else
but
a
lover
is
dogmatic
to
him
the
world
shall
be
beautiful
and
pure
when
it
is
not
he
ignores
it
he
s
not
tired
said
stephen
to
the
soldier
he
wants
his
and
they
winked
at
each
other
and
cracked
jokes
over
the
eternal
comedy
of
love
they
asked
each
other
if
they
d
let
a
girl
spoil
a
morning
s
ride
they
both
exhibited
a
profound
cynicism
stephen
who
was
quite
without
ballast
described
the
household
at
cadover
he
should
say
that
rickie
would
find
miss
pembroke
kissing
the
footman
i
say
the
footman
s
kissing
old
em
jolly
day
said
stephen
his
voice
was
suddenly
constrained
he
was
not
sure
whether
he
liked
the
soldier
after
all
nor
whether
he
had
been
wise
in
showing
him
his
compositions
old
em
ly
she
limps
and
as
all
right
thomas
that
ll
old
em
ly
i
wish
you
d
dry
up
like
a
good
fellow
this
is
the
lady
s
horse
you
know
hang
it
after
don
t
you
see
when
a
fellow
s
on
a
horse
he
can
t
let
another
fellow
kind
of
don
t
you
know
the
man
did
know
there
s
sense
in
he
said
approvingly
peace
was
restored
and
they
would
have
reached
salisbury
if
they
had
not
had
some
more
beer
it
unloosed
the
soldier
s
fancies
and
again
he
spoke
of
old
em
ly
and
recited
the
poem
with
aristophanic
variations
jolly
day
repeated
stephen
with
a
straightening
of
the
eyebrows
and
a
quick
glance
at
the
other
s
body
he
then
warned
him
against
the
variations
in
consequence
he
was
accused
of
being
a
member
of
the
his
blood
boiled
at
this
he
refuted
the
charge
and
became
great
friends
with
the
soldier
for
the
third
time
any
objection
to
saucy
and
tackleton
rather
the
soldier
sang
saucy
and
it
is
really
a
work
for
two
voices
most
of
the
sauciness

thomas

before
retorted
the
boy
the
other
concluded
he
might
now
say
anything
so
he
might
the
name
of
old
emily
excepted
stephen
cared
little
about
his
benefactress
s
honour
but
a
great
deal
about
his
own
he
had
made
mrs
failing
into
a
test
for
the
moment
he
would
die
for
her
as
a
knight
would
die
for
a
glove
he
is
not
to
be
distinguished
from
a
hero
old
sarum
was
passed
they
approached
the
most
beautiful
spire
in
the
world
lord
another
of
these
large
churches
said
the
soldier
unfriendly
to
gothic
he
lifted
both
hands
to
his
nose
and
declared
that
old
em
ly
was
buried
there
he
lay
in
the
mud
his
horse
trotted
back
towards
amesbury
stephen
had
twisted
him
out
of
the
saddle
i
ve
done
him
he
yelled
though
no
one
was
there
to
hear
he
rose
up
in
his
stirrups
and
shouted
with
joy
he
flung
his
arms
round
aeneas
s
neck
the
elderly
horse
understood
capered
and
bolted
it
was
a
centaur
that
dashed
into
salisbury
and
scattered
the
people
in
the
stable
he
would
not
dismount
i
ve
done
him
he
yelled
to
the
ostlers
apathetic
men
stretching
upwards
he
clung
to
a
beam
aeneas
moved
on
and
he
was
left
hanging
greatly
did
he
incommode
them
by
his
exercises
he
pulled
up
he
circled
he
kicked
the
other
customers
at
last
he
fell
to
the
earth
deliciously
fatigued
his
body
worried
him
no
longer
he
went
like
the
baby
he
was
to
buy
a
white
linen
hat
there
were
soldiers
about
and
he
thought
it
would
disguise
him
then
he
had
a
little
lunch
to
steady
the
beer
this
day
had
turned
out
admirably
all
the
money
that
should
have
fed
rickie
he
could
spend
on
himself
instead
of
toiling
over
the
cathedral
and
seeing
the
stuffed
penguins
he
could
stop
the
whole
thing
in
the
cattle
market
there
he
met
and
made
some
friends
he
watched
the
and
saw
how
necessary
it
was
to
have
a
confident
manner
he
spoke
confidently
himself
about
lambs
and
people
listened
he
spoke
confidently
about
pigs
and
they
roared
with
laughter
he
must
learn
more
about
pigs
he
witnessed
a
performance
not
too
of
punch
and
judy
hullo
podge
cried
a
naughty
little
girl
he
tried
to
catch
her
and
failed
she
was
one
of
the
cadford
children
for
salisbury
on
market
day
though
it
is
not
picturesque
is
certainly
representative
and
you
read
the
names
of
half
the
wiltshire
villages
upon
the
carriers
carts
he
found
in
penny
farthing
street
the
cart
from
wintersbridge
it
would
not
start
for
several
hours
but
the
passengers
always
used
it
as
a
club
and
sat
in
it
every
now
and
then
during
the
day
no
less
than
three
ladies
were
these
now
staring
at
the
shafts
one
of
them
was
flea
thompson
s
girl
he
asked
her
quite
politely
why
her
lover
had
broken
faith
with
him
in
the
rain
she
was
silent
he
warned
her
of
approaching
vengeance
she
was
still
silent
but
another
woman
hoped
that
a
gentleman
would
not
be
hard
on
a
poor
person
something
in
this
annoyed
him
it
wasn
t
a
question
of
gentility
and
poverty
it
was
a
question
of
two
men
he
determined
to
go
back
by
cadbury
rings
where
the
shepherd
would
now
be
he
did
but
this
part
must
be
treated
lightly
he
rode
up
to
the
culprit
with
the
air
of
a
saint
george
spoke
a
few
stern
words
from
the
saddle
tethered
his
steed
to
a
hurdle
and
took
off
his
coat
are
you
ready
he
asked
yes
sir
said
flea
and
flung
him
on
his
back
that
s
not
fair
he
protested
the
other
did
not
reply
but
flung
him
on
his
head
how
on
earth
did
you
learn
that
by
trying
often
said
flea
stephen
sat
on
the
ground
picking
mud
out
of
his
forehead
i
meant
it
to
be
fists
he
said
gloomily
i
know
it
s
jolly
smart
though
and
and
i
beg
your
pardon
all
it
cost
him
a
great
deal
to
say
this
but
he
was
sure
that
it
was
the
right
thing
to
say
he
must
acknowledge
the
better
man
whereas
most
people
if
they
provoke
a
fight
and
are
flung
say
you
can
not
rob
me
of
my
moral
there
was
nothing
further
to
be
done
he
mounted
again
not
exactly
depressed
but
feeling
that
this
delightful
world
is
extraordinarily
unreliable
he
had
never
expected
to
fling
the
soldier
or
to
be
flung
by
flea
one
nips
or
is
nipped
he
thought
and
never
knows
beforehand
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
many
people
had
more
in
them
than
i
suppose
while
others
were
just
the
other
way
round
i
haven
t
seen
that
sort
of
thing
in
ingersoll
but
it
s
quite
then
his
thoughts
turned
to
a
curious
incident
of
long
ago
when
he
had
been
nipped
as
a
little
boy
he
was
trespassing
in
those
woods
when
he
met
in
a
narrow
glade
a
flock
of
sheep
they
had
neither
dog
nor
shepherd
and
advanced
towards
him
silently
he
was
accustomed
to
sheep
but
had
never
happened
to
meet
them
in
a
wood
before
and
disliked
it
he
retired
slowly
at
first
then
fast
and
the
flock
in
a
dense
mass
pressed
after
him
his
terror
increased
he
turned
and
screamed
at
their
long
white
faces
and
still
they
came
on
all
stuck
together
like
some
horrible
jell
if
once
he
got
into
them
bellowing
and
screeching
he
rushed
into
the
undergrowth
tore
himself
all
over
and
reached
home
in
convulsions
mr
failing
his
only
friend
was
sympathetic
but
quite
stupid
pan
ovium
custos
he
sympathetic
as
he
pulled
out
the
thorns
why
not
pan
ovium
stephen
learnt
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
at
school
a
pan
of
eggs
for
he
still
remembered
how
the
other
boys
looked
as
he
peeped
at
them
between
his
legs
awaiting
the
descending
cane
so
he
returned
full
of
pleasant
disconnected
thoughts
he
had
had
a
rare
good
time
he
liked
every
one
even
that
poor
little
elliot
and
yet
no
one
mattered
they
were
all
out
on
the
landing
he
saw
the
housemaid
he
felt
skittish
and
irresistible
should
he
slip
his
arm
round
her
waist
perhaps
better
not
she
might
box
his
ears
and
he
wanted
to
smoke
on
the
roof
before
dinner
so
he
only
said
please
will
you
stop
the
boy
blacking
my
brown
boots
and
she
with
downcast
eyes
answered
yes
sir
i
will
his
room
was
in
the
pediment
classical
architecture
like
all
things
in
this
world
that
attempt
serenity
is
bound
to
have
its
lapses
into
the
undignified
and
cadover
lapsed
hopelessly
when
it
came
to
stephen
s
room
it
gave
him
one
round
window
to
see
through
which
he
must
lie
upon
his
stomach
one
trapdoor
opening
upon
the
leads
three
iron
girders
three
beams
six
buttresses
no
circling
unless
you
count
the
walls
no
walls
unless
you
count
the
ceiling
and
in
its
embarrassment
presented
him
with
the
gurgly
cistern
that
supplied
the
bath
water
here
he
lived
absolutely
happy
and
unaware
that
mrs
failing
had
poked
him
up
here
on
purpose
to
prevent
him
from
growing
too
bumptious
here
he
worked
and
sang
and
practised
on
the
ocharoon
here
in
the
crannies
he
had
constructed
shelves
and
cupboards
and
useless
little
drawers
he
had
only
one
picture
the
demeter
of
onidos
and
she
hung
straight
from
the
roof
like
a
joint
of
meat
once
she
was
in
the
but
mrs
failing
had
got
tired
of
her
and
decreed
her
removal
and
this
degradation
now
she
faced
the
sunrise
and
when
the
moon
rose
its
light
also
fell
on
her
and
trembled
like
light
upon
the
sea
for
she
was
never
still
and
if
the
draught
increased
she
would
twist
on
her
string
and
would
sway
and
tap
upon
the
rafters
until
stephen
woke
up
and
said
what
he
thought
of
her
want
your
nose
he
would
murmur
don
t
you
wish
you
may
get
it
then
he
drew
the
clothes
over
his
ears
while
above
him
in
the
wind
and
the
darkness
the
goddess
continued
her
motions
today
as
he
entered
he
trod
on
the
pile
of
sixpenny
reprints
leighton
had
brought
them
up
he
looked
at
the
portraits
in
their
covers
and
began
to
think
that
these
people
were
not
everything
what
a
fate
to
look
like
colonel
ingersoll
or
to
marry
julia
chunk
the
demeter
turned
towards
him
as
he
bathed
and
in
the
cold
water
he
sang
they
aren
t
beautiful
they
aren
t
modest
i
d
just
as
soon
follow
an
old
stone
goddess
and
sprang
upward
through
the
skylight
on
to
the
roof
years
ago
when
a
nurse
was
washing
him
he
had
slipped
from
her
soapy
hands
and
got
up
here
she
implored
him
to
remember
that
he
was
a
little
gentleman
but
he
forgot
the
fact
if
it
was
a
fact
and
not
even
the
butler
could
get
him
down
mr
failing
who
was
sitting
alone
in
the
garden
too
ill
to
read
heard
a
shout
am
i
an
acroterium
he
looked
up
and
saw
a
naked
child
poised
on
the
summit
of
cadover
yes
he
replied
but
they
are
unfashionable
go
in
and
the
vision
had
remained
with
him
as
something
peculiarly
gracious
he
felt
that
nonsense
and
beauty
have
close
connections
closer
connections
than
art
will
allow
and
that
both
would
remain
when
his
own
heaviness
and
his
own
ugliness
had
perished
mrs
failing
found
in
his
remains
a
sentence
that
puzzled
her
i
see
the
respectable
mansion
i
see
the
smug
fortress
of
culture
the
doors
are
shut
the
windows
are
shut
but
on
the
roof
the
children
go
dancing
for
stephen
was
a
child
no
longer
he
never
stood
on
the
pediment
now
except
for
a
bet
he
never
or
scarcely
ever
poured
water
down
the
chimneys
when
he
caught
the
cat
he
seldom
dropped
her
into
the
housekeeper
s
bedroom
but
still
when
the
weather
was
fair
he
liked
to
come
up
after
bathing
and
get
dry
in
the
sun
today
he
brought
with
him
a
towel
a
pipe
of
tobacco
and
rickie
s
story
he
must
get
it
done
some
time
and
he
was
tired
of
the
reprints
the
sloping
gable
was
warm
and
he
lay
back
on
it
with
closed
eyes
gasping
for
pleasure
starlings
criticized
him
snots
fell
on
his
clean
body
and
over
him
a
little
cloud
was
tinged
with
the
colours
of
evening
good
good
he
whispered
good
oh
good
and
opened
the
manuscript
reluctantly
what
a
production
who
was
this
girl
where
did
she
go
to
why
so
much
talk
about
trees
i
take
it
he
wrote
it
when
feeling
bad
he
murmured
and
let
it
fall
into
the
gutter
it
fell
face
downwards
and
on
the
back
he
saw
a
neat
little
resume
in
miss
pembroke
s
handwriting
intended
for
such
as
him
allegory
man
modern
civilization
in
bad
sense
girl
getting
into
touch
with
in
touch
with
nature
the
girl
was
a
tree
he
lit
his
pipe
and
gazed
at
the
radiant
earth
the
foreground
was
hidden
but
there
was
the
village
with
its
elms
and
the
roman
road
and
cadbury
rings
there
too
were
those
woods
and
little
beech
copses
crowning
a
waste
of
down
not
to
mention
the
air
or
the
sun
or
water
good
oh
good
in
touch
with
nature
what
cant
would
the
books
think
of
next
his
eyes
closed
he
was
sleepy
good
oh
good
sighing
into
his
pipe
he
fell
asleep
xiii
glad
as
agnes
was
when
her
lover
returned
for
lunch
she
was
at
the
same
time
rather
dismayed
she
knew
that
mrs
failing
would
not
like
her
plans
altered
and
her
dismay
was
justified
their
hostess
was
a
little
stiff
and
asked
whether
stephen
had
been
obnoxious
indeed
he
hasn
t
he
spent
the
whole
time
looking
after
from
which
i
conclude
he
was
more
obnoxious
than
rickie
praised
him
diligently
but
his
candid
nature
showed
everything
through
his
aunt
soon
saw
that
they
had
not
got
on
she
had
expected
this
almost
planned
it
nevertheless
she
resented
it
and
her
resentment
was
to
fall
on
him
the
storm
gathered
slowly
and
many
other
things
went
to
swell
it
weakly
people
if
they
are
not
careful
hate
one
another
and
when
the
weakness
is
hereditary
the
temptation
increases
elliots
had
never
got
on
among
themselves
they
talked
of
the
family
but
they
always
turned
outwards
to
the
health
and
beauty
that
lie
so
promiscuously
about
the
world
rickie
s
father
had
turned
for
a
time
at
all
events
to
his
mother
rickie
himself
was
turning
to
agnes
and
mrs
failing
now
was
irritable
and
unfair
to
the
nephew
who
was
lame
like
her
horrible
brother
and
like
herself
she
thought
him
invertebrate
and
conventional
she
was
envious
of
his
happiness
she
did
not
trouble
to
understand
his
art
she
longed
to
shatter
him
but
knowing
as
she
did
that
the
human
thunderbolt
often
rebounds
and
strikes
the
wielder
she
held
her
hand
agnes
watched
the
approaching
clouds
rickie
had
warned
her
now
she
began
to
warn
him
as
the
visit
wore
away
she
urged
him
to
be
pleasant
to
his
aunt
and
so
convert
it
into
a
success
he
replied
why
need
it
be
a
success
a
reply
in
the
manner
of
ansell
she
laughed
oh
that
s
so
like
you
men
all
theory
what
about
your
great
theory
of
hating
no
one
as
soon
as
it
comes
in
useful
you
drop
i
don
t
hate
aunt
emily
honestly
but
certainly
i
don
t
want
to
be
near
her
or
think
about
her
don
t
you
think
there
are
two
great
things
in
life
that
we
ought
to
aim
at
truth
and
kindness
let
s
have
both
if
we
can
but
let
s
be
sure
of
having
one
or
the
other
my
aunt
gives
up
both
for
the
sake
of
being
and
stephen
wonham
pursued
agnes
there
s
another
person
you
hate
or
don
t
think
about
if
you
prefer
it
put
like
the
truth
is
i
m
changing
i
m
beginning
to
see
that
the
world
has
many
people
in
it
who
don
t
matter
i
had
time
for
them
once
not
there
was
only
one
gate
to
the
kingdom
of
heaven
now
agnes
surprised
him
by
saying
but
the
wonham
boy
is
evidently
a
part
of
your
aunt
s
life
she
laughs
at
him
but
she
is
fond
of
what
s
that
to
do
with
it
you
ought
to
be
pleasant
to
him
on
account
of
why
on
earth
she
flushed
a
little
i
m
one
ought
to
consider
one
s
hostess
and
fall
in
with
her
life
after
we
leave
it
s
another
thing
but
while
we
take
her
hospitality
i
think
it
s
our
her
good
sense
triumphed
henceforth
he
tried
to
fall
in
with
aunt
emily
s
life
aunt
emily
watched
him
trying
the
storm
broke
as
storms
sometimes
do
on
sunday
sunday
church
was
a
function
at
cadover
though
a
strange
one
the
pompous
landau
rolled
up
to
the
house
at
a
quarter
to
eleven
then
mrs
failing
said
why
am
i
being
hurried
and
after
an
interval
descended
the
steps
in
her
ordinary
clothes
she
regarded
the
church
as
a
sort
of
and
refused
even
to
wear
a
bonnet
there
the
village
was
shocked
but
at
the
same
time
a
little
proud
it
would
point
out
the
carriage
to
strangers
and
gossip
about
the
pale
smiling
lady
who
sat
in
it
always
alone
always
late
her
hair
always
draped
in
an
expensive
shawl
this
sunday
though
late
as
usual
she
was
not
alone
miss
pembroke
en
grande
toilette
sat
by
her
side
rickie
looking
plain
and
devout
perched
opposite
and
stephen
actually
came
too
murmuring
that
it
would
be
the
benedicite
which
he
had
never
minded
there
was
also
the
litany
which
drove
him
into
the
air
again
much
to
failing
s
delight
she
enjoyed
this
sort
of
thing
it
amused
her
when
her
protege
left
the
pew
looking
bored
athletic
and
dishevelled
and
groping
most
obviously
for
his
pipe
she
liked
to
keep
a
thoroughbred
pagan
to
shock
people
he
s
gone
to
worship
nature
she
whispered
rickie
did
not
look
up
don
t
you
think
he
s
charming
he
made
no
reply
charming
whispered
agnes
over
his
head
during
the
sermon
she
analysed
her
guests
miss
pembroke
undistinguished
unimaginative
tolerable
rickie
intolerable
and
how
pedantic
she
mused
he
smells
of
the
university
library
if
he
was
stupid
in
the
right
way
he
would
be
a
she
looked
round
the
tiny
church
at
the
whitewashed
pillars
the
humble
pavement
the
window
full
of
magenta
saints
there
was
the
vicar
s
wife
and
wilbraham
s
bonnet
ugh
the
rest
of
the
congregation
were
poor
women
with
flat
hopeless
faces
she
saw
them
sunday
after
sunday
but
did
not
know
their
names
diversified
with
a
few
reluctant
and
the
vile
little
school
children
row
upon
row
ugh
what
a
hole
thought
mrs
failing
whose
christianity
was
the
type
best
described
as
what
a
hole
for
a
cultured
woman
i
don
t
think
it
has
blunted
my
sensations
though
i
still
see
its
squalor
as
clearly
as
ever
and
my
nephew
pretends
he
is
worshipping
pah
the
above
her
the
vicar
spoke
of
the
danger
of
hurrying
from
one
dissipation
to
another
she
treasured
his
words
and
continued
i
can
not
stand
smugness
it
is
the
one
the
unpardonable
sin
fresh
air
the
fresh
air
that
has
made
stephen
wonham
fresh
and
companionable
and
strong
even
if
it
kills
i
will
let
in
the
fresh
thus
reasoned
mrs
failing
in
the
facile
vein
of
ibsenism
she
imagined
herself
to
be
a
scandinavian
heroine
really
she
was
an
english
old
lady
who
did
not
mind
giving
other
people
a
chill
provided
it
was
not
infectious
agnes
on
the
way
back
noted
that
her
hostess
was
a
little
snappish
but
one
is
so
hungry
after
morning
service
and
either
so
hot
or
so
cold
that
he
would
be
a
saint
indeed
who
becomes
a
saint
at
once
mrs
failing
after
asserting
vindictively
that
it
was
impossible
to
make
a
living
out
of
literature
was
courteously
left
alone
and
moselle
might
yet
work
miracles
and
agnes
still
hoped
for
the
introductions
the
introductions
to
certain
editors
and
publishers
on
which
her
whole
diplomacy
was
bent
rickie
would
not
push
himself
it
was
his
besetting
sin
well
for
him
that
he
would
have
a
wife
and
a
loving
wife
who
knew
the
value
of
enterprise
unfortunately
lunch
was
a
quarter
of
an
hour
late
and
during
that
quarter
of
an
hour
the
aunt
and
the
nephew
quarrelled
she
had
been
inveighing
against
the
morning
service
and
he
quietly
and
deliberately
replied
if
organized
religion
is
anything
and
it
is
something
to
me
it
will
not
be
wrecked
by
a
harmonium
and
a
dull
mrs
failing
frowned
i
envy
you
it
is
a
great
thing
to
have
no
sense
of
i
think
i
have
a
sense
of
beauty
which
leads
me
astray
if
i
am
not
but
this
is
a
great
relief
to
me
i
thought
the
present
day
young
man
was
an
agnostic
isn
t
agnosticism
all
the
thing
at
cambridge
nothing
is
the
thing
at
cambridge
if
a
few
men
are
agnostic
there
it
is
for
some
grave
reason
not
because
they
are
irritated
with
the
way
the
parson
says
his
agnes
intervened
well
i
side
with
aunt
emily
i
believe
in
don
t
my
dear
side
with
me
he
will
only
say
you
have
no
sense
of
religion
excuse
me
said
rickie
perhaps
he
too
was
a
little
hungry
i
never
suggested
such
a
thing
i
never
would
suggest
such
a
thing
why
can
not
you
understand
my
position
i
almost
feel
it
is
that
you
won
i
try
to
understand
your
position
night
and
day
dear
what
you
mean
what
you
like
why
you
came
to
cadover
and
why
you
stop
here
when
my
presence
is
so
obviously
unpleasing
to
luncheon
is
served
said
leighton
but
he
said
it
too
late
they
discussed
the
beef
and
the
moselle
in
silence
the
air
was
heavy
and
ominous
even
the
wonham
boy
was
affected
by
it
shivered
at
times
choked
once
and
hastened
anew
into
the
sun
he
could
not
understand
clever
people
agnes
in
a
brief
anxious
interview
advised
the
culprit
to
take
a
solitary
walk
she
would
stop
near
aunt
emily
and
pave
the
way
for
an
apology
don
t
worry
too
much
it
doesn
t
really
i
suppose
not
dear
but
it
seems
a
pity
considering
we
are
so
near
the
end
of
our
rudeness
and
grossness
matter
and
i
ve
shown
both
and
already
i
m
sorry
and
i
hope
she
ll
let
me
apologize
but
from
the
selfish
point
of
view
it
doesn
t
matter
a
straw
she
s
no
more
to
us
than
the
wonham
boy
or
the
boot
which
way
will
you
walk
i
think
to
that
entrenchment
look
at
they
were
sitting
on
the
steps
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
cadsbury
rings
and
then
let
it
rest
for
a
moment
on
her
shoulder
you
re
changing
me
he
said
gently
god
bless
you
for
he
enjoyed
his
walk
cadford
was
a
charming
village
and
for
a
time
he
hung
over
the
bridge
by
the
mill
so
clear
was
the
stream
that
it
seemed
not
water
at
all
but
some
invisible
quintessence
in
which
the
happy
minnows
and
the
weeds
were
vibrating
and
he
paused
again
at
the
roman
crossing
and
thought
for
a
moment
of
the
unknown
child
the
line
curved
suddenly
certainly
it
was
dangerous
then
he
lifted
his
eyes
to
the
down
the
entrenchment
showed
like
the
rim
of
a
saucer
and
over
its
narrow
line
peeped
the
summit
of
the
central
tree
it
looked
interesting
he
hurried
forward
with
the
wind
behind
him
the
rings
were
curious
rather
than
impressive
neither
embankment
was
over
twelve
feet
high
and
the
grass
on
them
had
not
the
exquisite
green
of
old
sarum
but
was
grey
and
wiry
but
nature
if
she
arranges
anything
had
arranged
that
from
them
at
all
events
there
should
be
a
view
the
whole
system
of
the
country
lay
spread
before
rickie
and
he
gained
an
idea
of
it
that
he
never
got
in
his
elaborate
ride
he
saw
how
all
the
water
converges
at
salisbury
how
salisbury
lies
in
a
shallow
basin
just
at
the
change
of
the
soil
he
saw
to
the
north
the
plain
and
the
stream
of
the
cad
flowing
down
from
it
with
a
tributary
that
broke
out
suddenly
as
the
chalk
streams
do
one
village
had
clustered
round
the
source
and
clothed
itself
with
trees
he
saw
old
sarum
and
hints
of
the
avon
valley
and
the
land
above
stone
henge
and
behind
him
he
saw
the
great
wood
beginning
unobtrusively
as
if
the
down
too
needed
shaving
and
into
it
the
road
to
london
slipped
covering
the
bushes
with
white
dust
chalk
made
the
dust
white
chalk
made
the
water
clear
chalk
made
the
clean
rolling
outlines
of
the
land
and
favoured
the
grass
and
the
distant
coronals
of
trees
here
is
the
heart
of
our
island
the
chilterns
the
north
downs
the
south
downs
radiate
hence
the
fibres
of
england
unite
in
wiltshire
and
did
we
condescend
to
worship
her
here
we
should
erect
our
national
shrine
people
at
that
time
were
trying
to
think
imperially
rickie
wondered
how
they
did
it
for
he
could
not
imagine
a
place
larger
than
england
and
other
people
talked
of
italy
the
spiritual
fatherland
of
us
all
perhaps
italy
would
prove
marvellous
but
at
present
he
conceived
it
as
something
exotic
to
be
admired
and
reverenced
but
not
to
be
loved
like
these
unostentatious
fields
he
drew
out
a
book
it
was
natural
for
him
to
read
when
he
was
happy
and
to
read
out
loud
and
for
a
little
time
his
voice
disturbed
the
silence
of
that
glorious
afternoon
the
book
was
shelley
and
it
opened
at
a
passage
that
he
had
cherished
greatly
two
years
before
and
marked
as
very
i
never
was
attached
to
that
great
sect
whose
doctrine
is
that
each
one
should
select
out
of
the
world
a
mistress
or
a
friend
and
all
the
rest
though
fair
and
wise
commend
to
cold
oblivion
though
it
is
the
code
of
modern
morals
and
the
beaten
road
which
those
poor
slaves
with
weary
footsteps
tread
who
travel
to
their
home
among
the
dead
by
the
broad
highway
of
the
world
and
so
with
one
sad
friend
perhaps
a
jealous
foe
the
dreariest
and
the
longest
journey
it
was
very
good
fine
poetry
and
in
a
sense
true
yet
he
was
surprised
that
he
had
ever
selected
it
so
vehemently
this
afternoon
it
seemed
a
little
inhuman
half
a
mile
off
two
lovers
were
keeping
company
where
all
the
villagers
could
see
them
they
cared
for
no
one
else
they
felt
only
the
pressure
of
each
other
and
so
progressed
silent
and
oblivious
across
the
land
he
felt
them
to
be
nearer
the
truth
than
shelley
even
if
they
suffered
or
quarrelled
they
would
have
been
nearer
the
truth
he
wondered
whether
they
were
henry
adams
and
jessica
thompson
both
of
this
parish
whose
banns
had
been
asked
for
the
second
time
in
the
church
this
morning
why
could
he
not
marry
on
fifteen
shillings
and
be
looked
at
them
with
respect
and
wished
that
he
was
not
a
cumbersome
gentleman
presently
he
saw
something
less
pleasant
his
aunt
s
pony
carriage
it
had
crossed
the
railway
and
was
advancing
up
the
roman
road
along
by
the
straw
sacks
his
impulse
was
to
retreat
but
someone
waved
to
him
it
was
agnes
she
waved
continually
as
much
as
to
say
wait
for
mrs
failing
herself
raised
the
whip
in
a
nonchalant
way
stephen
wonham
was
following
on
foot
some
way
behind
he
put
the
shelley
back
into
his
pocket
and
waited
for
them
when
the
carriage
stopped
by
some
hurdles
he
went
down
from
the
embankment
and
helped
them
to
dismount
he
felt
rather
nervous
his
aunt
gave
him
one
of
her
disquieting
smiles
but
said
pleasantly
enough
aren
t
the
rings
a
little
immense
agnes
and
i
came
here
because
we
wanted
an
antidote
to
the
morning
pang
said
the
church
bell
suddenly
pang
pang
it
sounded
petty
and
ludicrous
they
all
laughed
rickie
blushed
and
agnes
with
a
glance
that
said
apologize
darted
away
to
the
entrenchment
as
though
unable
to
restrain
her
curiosity
the
pony
won
t
move
said
mrs
failing
leave
him
for
stephen
to
tie
up
will
you
walk
me
to
the
tree
in
the
middle
booh
i
m
tired
give
me
your
arm
unless
you
re
tired
as
no
i
came
out
partly
in
the
hope
of
helping
how
sweet
of
she
contrasted
his
blatant
unselfishness
with
the
hardness
of
stephen
stephen
never
came
out
to
help
you
but
if
you
got
hold
of
him
he
was
some
good
he
didn
t
wobble
and
bend
at
the
critical
moment
her
fancy
compared
rickie
to
the
cracked
church
bell
sending
forth
its
message
of
pang
pang
to
the
countryside
and
stephen
to
the
young
pagans
who
were
said
to
lie
under
this
field
guarding
their
pagan
gold
this
place
is
full
of
ghosties
she
remarked
have
you
seen
any
yet
i
ve
kept
on
the
outer
rim
so
let
s
go
to
the
tree
in
the
here
s
the
the
bank
of
grass
where
he
had
sat
was
broken
by
a
gap
through
which
chariots
had
entered
and
farm
carts
entered
now
the
track
following
the
ancient
track
led
straight
through
turnips
to
a
similar
gap
in
the
second
circle
and
thence
continued
through
more
turnips
to
the
central
tree
pang
said
the
bell
as
they
paused
at
the
entrance
you
needn
t
unharness
shouted
mrs
failing
for
stephen
was
approaching
the
carriage
yes
i
will
he
retorted
you
will
will
you
she
murmured
with
a
smile
i
wish
your
brother
wasn
t
quite
so
uppish
let
s
get
on
doesn
t
that
church
distract
you
it
s
so
faint
here
said
rickie
and
it
sounded
fainter
inside
though
the
earthwork
was
neither
thick
nor
tall
and
the
view
though
not
hidden
was
greatly
diminished
he
was
reminded
for
a
minute
of
that
chalk
pit
near
madingley
whose
ramparts
excluded
the
familiar
world
agnes
was
here
as
she
had
once
been
there
she
stood
on
the
farther
barrier
waiting
to
receive
them
when
they
had
traversed
the
heart
of
the
camp
admire
my
said
mrs
failing
they
are
said
to
grow
so
splendidly
on
account
of
the
dead
soldiers
isn
t
it
a
sweet
thought
need
i
say
it
is
your
brother
s
wonham
s
he
suggested
it
was
the
second
time
that
she
had
made
the
little
slip
she
nodded
and
he
asked
her
what
kind
of
ghosties
haunted
this
curious
field
the
was
her
prompt
reply
he
leans
against
the
tree
in
the
middle
especially
on
sunday
afternoons
and
all
the
worshippers
rise
through
the
turnips
and
dance
round
oh
these
were
decent
people
he
replied
looking
downwards
soldiers
and
shepherds
they
have
no
ghosts
they
worshipped
mars
or
perhaps
not
the
pang
went
the
church
and
was
silent
for
the
afternoon
service
had
begun
they
entered
the
second
entrenchment
which
was
in
height
breadth
and
composition
similar
to
the
first
and
excluded
still
more
of
the
view
his
aunt
continued
friendly
agnes
stood
watching
them
soldiers
may
seem
decent
in
the
past
she
continued
but
wait
till
they
turn
into
tommies
from
bulford
camp
who
rob
the
i
don
t
mind
bulford
camp
said
rickie
looking
though
in
vain
for
signs
of
its
snowy
tents
the
men
there
are
the
sons
of
the
men
here
and
have
come
back
to
the
old
country
war
s
horrible
yet
one
loves
all
continuity
and
no
one
could
mind
a
indeed
what
about
your
brother
a
shepherd
if
ever
there
was
look
how
he
bores
you
don
t
be
so
but
oh
you
mean
your
brother
he
glanced
at
her
nervously
he
had
never
known
her
so
queer
before
perhaps
it
was
some
literary
allusion
that
he
had
not
caught
but
her
face
did
not
at
that
moment
suggest
literature
in
the
differential
tones
that
one
uses
to
an
old
and
infirm
person
he
said
stephen
wonham
isn
t
my
brother
aunt
my
dear
you
re
that
precise
one
can
t
say
every
they
approached
the
central
tree
how
you
do
puzzle
me
he
said
dropping
her
arm
and
beginning
to
laugh
how
could
i
have
a
she
made
no
answer
then
a
horror
leapt
straight
at
him
and
he
beat
it
back
and
said
i
will
not
be
the
tree
in
the
centre
revolved
the
tree
disappeared
and
he
saw
a
room
the
room
where
his
father
had
lived
in
town
gently
he
told
himself
still
laughing
he
said
i
with
a
it
s
not
the
horror
leapt
again
and
he
exclaimed
it
s
a
foul
lie
my
dear
my
dear
it
s
a
foul
lie
he
wasn
t
i
won
t
stand
my
dear
before
you
say
several
noble
things
remember
that
it
s
worse
for
him
than
for
you
worse
for
your
brother
for
your
for
your
younger
but
he
heard
her
no
longer
he
was
gazing
at
the
past
which
he
had
praised
so
recently
which
gaped
ever
wider
like
an
unhallowed
grave
turn
where
he
would
it
encircled
him
it
took
visible
form
it
was
this
double
entrenchment
of
the
rings
his
mouth
went
cold
and
he
knew
that
he
was
going
to
faint
among
the
dead
he
started
running
missed
the
exit
stumbled
on
the
inner
barrier
fell
into
darkness
get
his
head
down
said
a
voice
get
the
blood
back
into
him
that
s
all
he
wants
leave
him
to
me
elliot
the
blood
was
returning
elliot
wake
up
he
woke
up
the
earth
he
had
dreaded
lay
close
to
his
eyes
and
seemed
beautiful
he
saw
the
structure
of
the
clods
a
tiny
beetle
swung
on
the
grass
blade
on
his
own
neck
a
human
hand
pressed
guiding
the
blood
back
to
his
brain
there
broke
from
him
a
cry
not
of
horror
but
of
acceptance
for
one
short
moment
he
understood
stephen
he
began
and
then
he
heard
his
own
name
called
rickie
rickie
agnes
hurried
from
her
post
on
the
margin
and
as
if
understanding
also
caught
him
to
her
breast
stephen
offered
to
help
them
further
but
finding
that
he
made
things
worse
he
stepped
aside
to
let
them
pass
and
then
sauntered
inwards
the
whole
field
with
concentric
circles
was
visible
and
the
broad
leaves
of
the
turnips
rustled
in
the
gathering
wind
miss
pembroke
and
elliot
were
moving
towards
the
cadover
entrance
mrs
failing
stood
watching
in
her
turn
on
the
opposite
bank
he
was
not
an
inquisitive
boy
but
as
he
leant
against
the
tree
he
wondered
what
it
was
all
about
and
whether
he
would
ever
know
xiv
on
the
way
back
at
that
very
where
he
had
paused
on
his
upward
route
rickie
stopped
suddenly
and
told
the
girl
why
he
had
fainted
hitherto
she
had
asked
him
in
vain
his
tone
had
gone
from
him
and
he
told
her
harshly
and
brutally
so
that
she
started
away
with
a
horrified
cry
then
his
manner
altered
and
he
exclaimed
will
you
mind
are
you
going
to
mind
of
course
i
mind
she
whispered
she
turned
from
him
and
saw
up
on
the
two
figures
that
seemed
to
be
of
enormous
size
they
re
watching
us
they
stand
on
the
edge
watching
us
this
country
s
so
open
you
you
can
t
they
watch
us
wherever
we
go
of
course
you
they
heard
the
rumble
of
the
train
and
she
pulled
herself
together
come
dearest
we
shall
be
run
over
next
we
re
saying
things
that
have
no
but
on
the
way
back
he
repeated
they
can
still
see
us
they
can
see
every
inch
of
this
road
they
watch
us
for
and
when
they
arrived
at
the
steps
there
sure
enough
were
still
the
two
figures
gazing
from
the
outer
circle
of
the
rings
she
made
him
go
to
his
room
at
once
he
was
almost
hysterical
leighton
brought
out
some
tea
for
her
and
she
sat
drinking
it
on
the
little
terrace
of
course
she
minded
again
she
was
menaced
by
the
abnormal
all
had
seemed
so
fair
and
so
simple
so
in
accordance
with
her
ideas
and
then
like
a
corpse
this
horror
rose
up
to
the
surface
she
saw
the
two
figures
descend
and
pause
while
one
of
them
harnessed
the
pony
she
saw
them
drive
downward
and
knew
that
before
long
she
must
face
them
and
the
world
she
glanced
at
her
engagement
ring
when
the
carriage
drove
up
mrs
failing
dismounted
but
did
not
speak
it
was
stephen
who
inquired
after
rickie
she
scarcely
knowing
the
sound
of
her
own
voice
replied
that
he
was
a
little
tired
go
and
put
up
the
pony
said
mrs
failing
rather
sharply
agnes
give
me
some
it
is
rather
strong
said
agnes
as
the
carriage
drove
off
and
left
them
alone
then
she
noticed
that
mrs
failing
herself
was
agitated
her
lips
were
trembling
and
she
saw
the
boy
depart
with
manifest
relief
do
you
know
she
said
hurriedly
as
if
talking
against
time
do
you
know
what
upset
rickie
i
do
indeed
has
he
told
any
one
else
i
believe
agnes
have
i
been
a
fool
you
have
been
very
unkind
said
the
girl
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
for
a
moment
mrs
failing
was
annoyed
unkind
i
do
not
see
that
at
all
i
believe
in
looking
facts
in
the
face
rickie
must
know
his
ghosts
some
time
why
not
this
afternoon
she
rose
with
quiet
dignity
but
her
tears
came
faster
that
is
not
so
you
told
him
to
hurt
him
i
can
not
think
what
you
did
it
for
i
suppose
because
he
was
rude
to
you
after
church
it
is
a
mean
cowardly
revenge
what
what
if
it
s
a
lie
then
mrs
failing
it
is
sickening
of
you
there
is
no
other
word
sickening
i
am
sorry
a
nobody
like
myself
to
speak
like
this
how
could
you
oh
how
could
you
demean
yourself
why
not
even
a
poor
person
her
indignation
was
fine
and
genuine
but
her
tears
fell
no
longer
nothing
menaced
her
if
they
were
not
really
brothers
it
is
not
a
lie
my
clear
sit
down
i
will
swear
so
much
solemnly
it
is
not
a
lie
but
agnes
waited
we
can
call
it
a
lie
if
we
i
am
not
so
childish
you
have
said
it
and
we
must
all
suffer
you
have
had
your
fun
i
conclude
you
did
it
for
fun
you
can
not
go
back
he
she
pointed
towards
the
stables
and
could
not
finish
her
sentence
i
have
not
been
a
fool
agnes
did
not
understand
my
dense
lady
can
t
you
follow
i
have
not
told
stephen
one
single
word
neither
before
nor
there
was
a
long
silence
indeed
mrs
failing
was
in
an
awkward
position
rickie
had
irritated
her
and
in
her
desire
to
shock
him
she
had
imperilled
her
own
peace
she
had
felt
so
unconventional
upon
the
hillside
when
she
loosed
the
horror
against
him
but
now
it
was
darting
at
her
as
well
suppose
the
scandal
came
out
stephen
who
was
absolutely
without
delicacy
would
tell
it
to
the
people
as
soon
as
tell
them
the
time
his
paganism
would
be
too
assertive
it
might
even
be
in
bad
taste
after
all
she
had
a
prominent
position
in
the
neighbourhood
she
was
talked
about
respected
looked
up
to
after
all
she
was
growing
old
and
therefore
though
she
had
no
true
regard
for
rickie
nor
for
agnes
nor
for
stephen
nor
for
stephen
s
parents
in
whose
tragedy
she
had
assisted
yet
she
did
feel
that
if
the
scandal
revived
it
would
disturb
the
harmony
of
cadover
and
therefore
tried
to
retrace
her
steps
it
is
easy
to
say
shocking
things
it
is
so
different
to
be
connected
with
anything
shocking
life
and
death
were
not
involved
but
comfort
and
discomfort
were
the
silence
was
broken
by
the
sound
of
feet
on
the
gravel
agnes
said
hastily
is
that
really
true
that
he
knows
nothing
you
rickie
and
i
are
the
only
people
alive
that
know
he
realizes
what
he
is
with
a
precision
that
is
sometimes
alarming
who
he
is
he
doesn
t
know
and
doesn
t
care
i
suppose
he
would
know
when
i
m
dead
there
are
aunt
emily
before
he
comes
may
i
say
to
you
i
m
sorry
i
was
so
rude
mrs
failing
had
not
disliked
her
courage
my
dear
you
may
we
re
all
off
our
hinges
this
sunday
sit
down
by
me
agnes
obeyed
and
they
awaited
the
arrival
of
stephen
they
were
clever
enough
to
understand
each
other
the
thing
must
be
hushed
up
the
matron
must
repair
the
consequences
of
her
petulance
the
girl
must
hide
the
stain
in
her
future
husband
s
family
why
not
who
was
injured
what
does
a
man
want
with
a
grown
brother
rickie
upstairs
how
grateful
he
would
be
to
them
for
saving
him
stephen
i
m
tired
of
you
go
and
bathe
in
the
all
and
the
whole
thing
was
settled
she
liked
no
fuss
and
so
did
he
he
sat
down
on
the
step
to
tighten
his
bootlaces
then
he
would
be
ready
mrs
failing
laid
two
or
three
sovereigns
on
the
step
above
him
agnes
tried
to
make
conversation
and
said
with
averted
eyes
that
the
sea
was
a
long
way
off
the
sea
s
downhill
that
s
all
i
know
about
he
swept
up
the
money
with
a
word
of
pleasure
he
was
kept
like
a
baby
in
such
things
then
he
started
off
but
slowly
for
he
meant
to
walk
till
the
morning
he
will
be
gone
days
said
mrs
failing
the
comedy
is
finished
let
us
come
she
went
to
her
room
the
storm
that
she
had
raised
had
shattered
her
yet
because
it
was
stilled
for
a
moment
she
resumed
her
old
emancipated
manner
and
spoke
of
it
as
a
comedy
as
for
miss
pembroke
she
pretended
to
be
emancipated
no
longer
people
like
stephen
wonham
were
social
thunderbolts
to
be
shunned
at
all
costs
or
at
almost
all
costs
her
joy
was
now
unfeigned
and
she
hurried
upstairs
to
impart
it
to
rickie
i
don
t
think
we
are
rewarded
if
we
do
right
but
we
are
punished
if
we
lie
it
s
the
fashion
to
laugh
at
poetic
justice
but
i
do
believe
in
half
of
it
cast
bitter
bread
upon
the
waters
and
after
many
days
it
really
will
come
back
to
these
were
the
words
of
mr
failing
they
were
also
the
opinions
of
stewart
ansell
another
unpractical
person
rickie
was
trying
to
write
to
him
when
she
entered
with
the
good
news
dear
we
re
saved
he
doesn
t
know
and
he
never
is
to
know
i
can
t
tell
you
how
glad
i
am
all
the
time
we
saw
them
standing
together
up
there
she
wasn
t
telling
him
at
all
she
was
keeping
him
out
of
the
way
in
case
you
let
it
out
oh
i
like
her
she
may
be
unwise
but
she
is
nice
really
she
said
i
ve
been
a
fool
but
i
haven
t
been
a
fool
you
must
forgive
her
rickie
i
ve
forgiven
her
and
she
me
for
at
first
i
was
so
angry
with
her
oh
my
darling
boy
i
am
so
glad
he
was
shivering
all
over
and
could
not
reply
at
last
he
said
why
hasn
t
she
told
him
because
she
has
come
to
her
but
she
can
t
behave
to
people
like
that
she
must
tell
because
he
must
be
told
such
a
real
such
a
real
thing
the
girl
echoed
screwing
up
her
forehead
but
but
you
don
t
mean
you
re
glad
about
it
his
head
bowed
over
the
letter
my
god
no
but
it
s
a
real
thing
she
must
tell
him
i
nearly
told
him
myself
up
there
when
he
made
me
look
at
the
ground
but
you
happened
to
prevent
how
providence
had
watched
over
them
she
won
t
tell
him
i
know
that
then
agnes
darling
he
drew
her
to
the
table
we
must
talk
together
a
little
if
she
won
t
then
we
ought
we
tell
him
cried
the
girl
white
with
horror
tell
him
now
when
everything
has
been
comfortably
arranged
you
see
darling
he
took
hold
of
her
hand
what
one
must
do
is
to
think
the
thing
out
and
settle
what
s
right
i
m
still
all
trembling
and
stupid
i
see
it
mixed
up
with
other
things
i
want
you
to
help
me
it
seems
to
me
that
here
and
there
in
life
we
meet
with
a
person
or
incident
that
is
symbolical
it
s
nothing
in
itself
yet
for
the
moment
it
stands
for
some
eternal
principle
we
accept
it
at
whatever
costs
and
we
have
accepted
life
but
if
we
are
frightened
and
reject
it
the
moment
so
to
speak
passes
the
symbol
is
never
offered
again
is
this
nonsense
once
before
a
symbol
was
offered
to
me
i
shall
not
tell
you
how
but
i
did
accept
it
and
cherished
it
through
much
anxiety
and
repulsion
and
in
the
end
i
am
rewarded
there
will
be
no
reward
this
time
i
think
from
such
a
man
the
son
of
such
a
man
but
i
want
to
do
what
is
because
doing
right
is
its
own
reward
said
agnes
anxiously
i
do
not
think
that
i
have
seen
few
examples
of
it
doing
right
is
simply
doing
i
think
that
all
you
say
is
wonderfully
clever
but
since
you
ask
me
it
is
nonsense
dear
rickie
thank
you
he
said
humbly
and
began
to
stroke
her
hand
but
all
my
disgust
my
indignation
with
my
father
my
love
for
he
broke
off
he
could
not
bear
to
mention
the
name
of
his
mother
i
was
trying
to
say
i
oughtn
t
to
follow
these
impulses
too
much
there
are
others
things
truth
our
duty
to
acknowledge
each
man
accurately
however
vile
he
is
and
apart
from
ideals
here
she
had
won
the
battle
and
leaving
ideals
aside
i
couldn
t
meet
him
and
keep
silent
it
isn
t
in
me
i
should
blurt
it
but
you
won
t
meet
him
she
cried
it
s
all
been
arranged
we
ve
sent
him
to
the
sea
isn
t
it
splendid
he
s
gone
my
own
boy
won
t
be
fantastic
will
he
then
she
fought
the
fantasy
on
its
own
ground
and
bye
the
bye
what
you
call
the
symbolic
moment
is
over
you
had
it
up
by
the
rings
you
tried
to
tell
him
i
interrupted
you
it
s
not
your
fault
you
did
all
you
she
thought
this
excellent
logic
and
was
surprised
that
he
looked
so
gloomy
so
he
s
gone
to
the
sea
for
the
present
that
does
settle
it
has
aunt
emily
talked
about
him
yet
no
ask
her
tomorrow
if
you
wish
to
know
ask
her
kindly
it
would
be
so
dreadful
if
you
did
not
part
friends
and
what
s
that
it
was
stephen
calling
up
from
the
drive
he
had
come
back
agnes
threw
out
her
hand
in
despair
elliot
the
voice
called
they
were
facing
each
other
silent
and
motionless
then
rickie
advanced
to
the
window
the
girl
darted
in
front
of
him
he
thought
he
had
never
seen
her
so
beautiful
she
was
stopping
his
advance
quite
frankly
with
widespread
arms
elliot
he
moved
forward
into
what
he
pretended
to
himself
he
would
rather
see
his
brother
before
he
answered
that
it
was
easier
to
acknowledge
him
thus
but
at
the
back
of
his
soul
he
knew
that
the
woman
had
conquered
and
that
he
was
moving
forward
to
acknowledge
her
if
he
calls
me
again
he
thought
elliot
well
if
he
calls
me
once
again
i
will
answer
him
vile
as
he
he
did
not
call
again
stephen
had
really
come
back
for
some
tobacco
but
as
he
passed
under
the
windows
he
thought
of
the
poor
fellow
who
had
been
nipped
nothing
serious
said
mrs
failing
and
determined
to
shout
to
him
and
once
or
twice
as
he
followed
the
river
into
the
darkness
he
wondered
what
it
was
like
to
be
so
weak
not
to
ride
not
to
swim
not
to
care
for
anything
but
books
and
a
girl
they
embraced
passionately
the
danger
had
brought
them
very
near
to
each
other
they
both
needed
a
home
to
confront
the
menacing
tumultuous
world
and
what
weary
years
of
work
of
waiting
lay
between
them
and
that
home
still
holding
her
fast
he
said
i
was
writing
to
ansell
when
you
came
do
you
owe
him
a
letter
he
paused
i
was
writing
to
tell
him
about
this
he
would
help
us
he
always
picks
out
the
important
darling
i
don
t
like
to
say
anything
and
i
know
that
ansell
would
keep
a
secret
but
haven
t
we
picked
out
the
important
point
for
ourselves
he
released
her
and
tore
the
letter
up
xv
the
sense
of
purity
is
a
puzzling
and
at
times
a
fearful
thing
it
seems
so
noble
and
it
starts
as
one
with
morality
but
it
is
a
dangerous
guide
and
can
lead
us
away
not
only
from
what
is
gracious
but
also
from
what
is
good
agnes
in
this
tangle
had
followed
it
blindly
partly
because
she
was
a
woman
and
it
meant
more
to
her
than
it
can
ever
mean
to
a
man
partly
because
though
dangerous
it
is
also
obvious
and
makes
no
demand
upon
the
intellect
she
could
not
feel
that
stephen
had
full
human
rights
he
was
illicit
abnormal
worse
than
a
man
diseased
and
rickie
remembering
whose
son
he
was
gradually
adopted
her
opinion
he
too
came
to
be
glad
that
his
brother
had
passed
from
him
untried
that
the
symbolic
moment
had
been
rejected
stephen
was
the
fruit
of
sin
therefore
he
was
sinful
he
too
became
a
sexual
snob
and
now
he
must
hear
the
unsavoury
details
that
evening
they
sat
in
the
walled
garden
agues
according
to
arrangement
left
him
alone
with
his
aunt
he
asked
her
and
was
not
answered
you
are
shocked
she
said
in
a
hard
mocking
voice
it
is
very
nice
of
you
to
be
shocked
and
i
do
not
wish
to
grieve
you
further
we
will
not
allude
to
it
again
let
us
all
go
on
just
as
we
are
the
comedy
is
he
could
not
tolerate
this
his
nerves
were
shattered
and
all
that
was
good
in
him
revolted
as
well
to
the
horror
of
agnes
who
was
within
earshot
he
replied
you
used
to
puzzle
me
aunt
emily
but
i
understand
you
at
last
you
have
forgotten
what
other
people
are
like
continual
selfishness
leads
to
that
i
am
sure
of
it
i
see
now
how
you
look
at
the
world
nice
of
me
to
be
shocked
i
want
to
go
tomorrow
if
i
certainly
dear
the
morning
trains
are
the
and
so
the
disastrous
visit
ended
as
he
walked
back
to
the
house
he
met
a
certain
poor
woman
whose
child
stephen
had
rescued
at
the
and
who
had
decided
after
some
delay
that
she
must
thank
the
kind
gentleman
in
person
he
has
got
some
brute
courage
thought
rickie
and
it
was
decent
of
him
not
to
boast
about
but
he
had
labelled
the
boy
as
bad
and
it
was
convenient
to
revert
to
his
good
qualities
as
seldom
as
possible
he
preferred
to
brood
over
his
coarseness
his
caddish
ingratitude
his
irreligion
out
of
these
he
constructed
a
repulsive
figure
forgetting
how
slovenly
his
own
perceptions
had
been
during
the
past
week
how
dogmatic
and
intolerant
his
attitude
to
all
that
was
not
love
during
the
packing
he
was
obliged
to
go
up
to
the
attic
to
find
the
dryad
manuscript
which
had
never
been
returned
leighton
came
too
and
for
about
half
an
hour
they
hunted
in
the
flickering
light
of
a
candle
it
was
a
strange
ghostly
place
and
rickie
was
quite
startled
when
a
picture
swung
towards
him
and
he
saw
the
demeter
of
cnidus
shimmering
and
grey
leighton
suggested
the
roof
stephen
sometimes
left
things
on
the
roof
so
they
climbed
out
of
the
skylight
the
night
was
perfectly
still
and
continued
the
search
among
the
gables
enormous
stars
hung
overhead
and
the
roof
was
bounded
by
chasms
impenetrable
and
black
it
doesn
t
matter
said
rickie
suddenly
convinced
of
the
futility
of
all
that
he
did
oh
let
us
look
properly
said
leighton
a
kindly
pliable
man
who
had
tried
to
shirk
coming
but
who
was
genuinely
sympathetic
now
that
he
had
come
they
were
rewarded
the
manuscript
lay
in
a
gutter
charred
and
smudged
the
rest
of
the
year
was
spent
by
rickie
partly
in
bed
he
had
a
curious
breakdown
partly
in
the
attempt
to
get
his
little
stories
published
he
had
written
eight
or
nine
and
hoped
they
would
make
up
a
book
and
that
the
book
might
be
called
pan
he
was
very
energetic
over
this
he
liked
to
work
for
some
imperceptible
bloom
had
passed
from
the
world
and
he
no
longer
found
such
acute
pleasure
in
people
failing
s
old
publishers
to
whom
the
book
was
submitted
replied
that
greatly
as
they
found
themselves
interested
they
did
not
see
their
way
to
making
an
offer
at
present
they
were
very
polite
and
singled
out
for
special
praise
andante
pastorale
which
rickie
had
thought
too
sentimental
but
which
agnes
had
persuaded
him
to
include
the
stories
were
sent
to
another
publisher
who
considered
them
for
six
weeks
and
then
returned
them
a
fragment
of
red
cotton
placed
by
agnes
between
the
leaves
had
not
shifted
its
position
can
t
you
try
something
longer
rickie
she
said
i
believe
we
re
on
the
wrong
track
try
an
out
and
out
my
notion
just
now
he
replied
is
to
leave
the
passions
on
the
she
nodded
and
tapped
for
the
waiter
they
had
met
in
a
london
restaurant
i
can
t
soar
i
can
only
indicate
that
s
where
the
musicians
have
the
pull
for
music
has
wings
and
when
she
says
tristan
and
he
says
isolde
you
are
on
the
heights
at
once
what
do
people
mean
when
they
call
love
music
artificial
i
know
what
they
mean
though
i
can
t
exactly
explain
or
couldn
t
you
make
your
stories
more
obvious
i
don
t
see
any
harm
in
that
uncle
willie
floundered
hopelessly
he
doesn
t
read
much
and
he
got
muddled
i
had
to
explain
and
then
he
was
delighted
of
course
to
write
down
to
the
public
would
be
quite
another
thing
and
horrible
you
have
certain
ideas
and
you
must
express
them
but
couldn
t
you
express
them
more
clearly
you
see
he
got
no
further
than
you
the
soul
and
the
body
the
soul
s
what
matters
said
agnes
and
tapped
for
the
waiter
again
he
looked
at
her
admiringly
but
felt
that
she
was
not
a
perfect
critic
perhaps
she
was
too
perfect
to
be
a
critic
actual
life
might
seem
to
her
so
real
that
she
could
not
detect
the
union
of
shadow
and
adamant
that
men
call
poetry
he
would
even
go
further
and
acknowledge
that
she
was
not
as
clever
as
himself
and
he
was
stupid
enough
she
did
not
like
discussing
anything
or
reading
solid
books
and
she
was
a
little
angry
with
such
women
as
did
it
pleased
him
to
make
these
concessions
for
they
touched
nothing
in
her
that
he
valued
he
looked
round
the
restaurant
which
was
in
soho
and
decided
that
she
was
incomparable
at
two
i
call
on
the
editor
of
the
he
s
got
a
stray
story
to
look
at
and
he
s
written
about
oh
rickie
rickie
why
didn
t
you
put
on
a
boiled
shirt
he
laughed
and
teased
her
the
soul
s
what
matters
we
literary
people
don
t
care
about
well
you
ought
to
care
and
i
believe
you
do
can
t
you
change
too
he
had
rooms
in
south
kensington
and
i
ve
forgot
my
there
s
for
you
she
shook
her
head
naughty
naughty
boy
whatever
will
you
do
send
in
my
name
or
ask
for
a
bit
of
paper
and
write
it
hullo
that
s
tilliard
tilliard
blushed
partly
on
account
of
the
faux
pas
he
had
made
last
june
partly
on
account
of
the
restaurant
he
explained
how
he
came
to
be
pigging
in
soho
it
was
so
frightfully
convenient
and
so
frightfully
cheap
just
why
rickie
brings
me
said
miss
pembroke
and
i
suppose
you
re
here
to
study
life
said
tilliard
sitting
down
i
don
t
know
said
rickie
gazing
round
at
the
waiters
and
the
guests
doesn
t
one
want
to
see
a
good
deal
of
life
for
writing
there
s
life
of
a
sort
in
soho
un
peu
de
faisan
s
il

agnes
also
grabbed
at
the
waiter
and
paid
she
always
did
the
paying
rickie
muddled
with
his
purse
i
m
cramming
pursued
tilliard
and
so
naturally
i
come
into
contact
with
very
little
at
present
but
later
on
i
hope
to
see
he
blushed
a
little
for
he
was
talking
for
rickie
s
edification
it
is
most
frightfully
important
not
to
get
a
narrow
or
academic
outlook
don
t
you
think
a
person
like
ansell
who
goes
from
cambridge
home
home
cambridge
it
must
tell
on
him
in
but
ansell
is
a
a
very
kinky
one
said
tilliard
abruptly
not
my
idea
of
a
philosopher
how
goes
his
dissertation
he
never
answers
my
letters
replied
rickie
he
never
would
i
ve
heard
nothing
since
it
s
a
pity
he
sends
in
this
year
there
are
so
many
good
people
in
he
d
have
afar
better
chance
if
he
so
i
said
but
he
wouldn
t
wait
he
s
so
keen
about
this
particular
what
is
it
asked
agnes
about
things
being
real
wasn
t
it
tilliard
that
s
near
well
good
luck
to
him
said
the
girl
and
good
luck
to
you
tilliard
later
on
i
hope
we
ll
meet
they
parted
tilliard
liked
her
though
he
did
not
feel
that
she
was
quite
in
his
couche
sociale
his
sister
for
instance
would
never
have
been
lured
into
a
soho
restaurant
except
for
the
experience
of
the
thing
tilliard
s
couche
sociale
permitted
experiences
provided
his
heart
did
not
go
out
to
the
poor
and
the
unorthodox
he
might
stare
at
them
as
much
as
he
liked
it
was
seeing
life
agnes
put
her
lover
safely
into
an
omnibus
at
cambridge
circus
she
shouted
after
him
that
his
tie
was
rising
over
his
collar
but
he
did
not
hear
her
for
a
moment
she
felt
depressed
and
pictured
quite
accurately
the
effect
that
his
appearance
would
have
on
the
editor
the
editor
was
a
tall
neat
man
of
forty
slow
of
speech
slow
of
soul
and
extraordinarily
kind
he
and
rickie
sat
over
a
fire
with
an
enormous
table
behind
them
whereon
stood
many
books
waiting
to
be
reviewed
i
m
sorry
he
said
and
paused
rickie
smiled
feebly
your
story
does
not
he
tapped
it
i
have
read
it
with
very
great
pleasure
it
convinces
in
parts
but
it
does
not
convince
as
a
whole
and
stories
don
t
you
think
ought
to
convince
as
a
whole
they
ought
indeed
said
rickie
and
plunged
into
but
the
editor
checked
him
no
no
please
don
t
talk
like
that
i
can
t
bear
to
hear
any
one
talk
against
imagination
there
are
countless
openings
for
imagination
for
the
mysterious
for
the
supernatural
for
all
the
things
you
are
trying
to
do
and
which
i
hope
you
will
succeed
in
doing
i
m
not
objecting
to
imagination
on
the
contrary
i
d
advise
you
to
cultivate
it
to
accent
it
write
a
really
good
ghost
story
and
we
d
take
it
at
once
or
he
suggested
it
as
an
alternative
to
imagination
or
you
might
get
inside
life
it
s
worth
life
echoed
rickie
anxiously
he
looked
round
the
pleasant
room
as
if
life
might
be
fluttering
there
like
an
imprisoned
bird
then
he
looked
at
the
editor
perhaps
he
was
sitting
inside
life
at
this
very
moment
see
life
elliot
and
then
send
us
another
he
held
out
his
hand
i
am
sorry
i
have
to
say
no
thank
you
it
s
so
much
nicer
to
say
yes
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
young
man
s
sleeve
and
added
well
the
interview
s
not
been
so
alarming
after
all
has
it
i
don
t
think
that
either
of
us
is
a
very
alarming
person
was
not
rickie
s
reply
it
was
what
he
thought
out
afterwards
in
the
omnibus
his
reply
was
ow
delivered
with
a
slight
giggle
as
he
rumbled
westward
his
face
was
drawn
and
his
eyes
moved
quickly
to
the
right
and
left
as
if
he
would
discover
something
in
the
squalid
fashionable
streets
some
bird
on
the
wing
some
radiant
archway
the
face
of
some
god
beneath
a
beaver
hat
he
loved
he
was
loved
he
had
seen
death
and
other
things
but
the
heart
of
all
things
was
hidden
there
was
a
password
and
he
could
not
learn
it
nor
could
the
kind
editor
of
the
holborn
teach
him
he
sighed
and
then
sighed
more
piteously
for
had
he
not
known
the
password
once
known
it
and
forgotten
it
already
but
at
this
point
his
fortunes
become
intimately
connected
with
those
of
pembroke
part
sawston
xvi
in
three
years
pembroke
had
done
much
to
solidify
the
at
sawston
school
if
they
were
not
solid
they
were
at
all
events
curdling
and
his
activities
might
reasonably
turn
elsewhere
he
had
served
the
school
for
many
years
and
it
was
really
time
he
should
be
entrusted
with
a
the
headmaster
an
impulsive
man
who
darted
about
like
a
minnow
and
gave
his
mother
a
great
deal
of
trouble
agreed
with
him
and
also
agreed
with
jackson
when
she
said
that
jackson
had
served
the
school
for
many
years
and
that
it
was
really
time
he
should
be
entrusted
with
a
consequently
when
dunwood
house
fell
vacant
the
headmaster
found
himself
in
rather
a
difficult
position
dunwood
house
was
the
largest
and
most
lucrative
of
the
it
stood
almost
opposite
the
school
buildings
originally
it
had
been
a
villa
residence
a
villa
covered
with
creepers
and
crowned
with
terracotta
dragons
annison
founder
of
its
glory
had
lived
here
and
had
had
one
or
two
boys
to
live
with
him
times
changed
the
fame
of
the
bishops
blazed
brighter
the
school
increased
the
one
or
two
boys
became
a
dozen
and
an
addition
was
made
to
dunwood
house
that
more
than
doubled
its
size
a
huge
new
building
replete
with
every
convenience
was
stuck
on
to
its
right
flank
dormitories
cubicles
studies
a
a
parquet
floors
pipes
no
expense
was
spared
and
the
twelve
boys
roamed
over
it
like
princes
baize
doors
communicated
on
every
floor
with
annison
s
part
and
he
an
anxious
gentleman
would
stroll
backwards
and
forwards
a
little
depressed
at
the
hygienic
splendours
and
conscious
of
some
vanished
intimacy
somehow
he
had
known
his
boys
better
when
they
had
all
muddled
together
as
one
family
and
algebras
lay
strewn
upon
the
drawing
room
chairs
as
the
house
filled
his
interest
in
it
decreased
when
he
retired
which
he
did
the
same
summer
that
rickie
left
cambridge
it
had
already
passed
the
summit
of
excellence
and
was
beginning
to
decline
its
numbers
were
still
satisfactory
and
for
a
little
time
it
would
subsist
on
its
past
reputation
but
that
mysterious
asset
the
tone
had
lowered
and
it
was
therefore
of
great
importance
that
annison
s
successor
should
be
a
man
coates
who
came
next
in
seniority
was
passed
over
and
rightly
the
choice
lay
between
pembroke
and
jackson
the
one
an
organizer
the
other
a
humanist
jackson
was
master
of
the
sixth
and
with
the
exception
of
the
headmaster
who
was
too
busy
to
impart
knowledge
the
only
intellect
in
the
school
but
he
could
not
or
rather
would
not
keep
order
he
told
his
form
that
if
it
chose
to
listen
to
him
it
would
learn
if
it
didn
t
it
wouldn
t
one
half
listened
the
other
half
made
paper
frogs
and
bored
holes
in
the
raised
map
of
italy
with
their
penknives
when
the
penknives
gritted
he
punished
them
with
undue
severity
and
then
forgot
to
make
them
show
the
punishments
up
yet
out
of
this
chaos
two
facts
emerged
half
the
boys
got
scholarships
at
the
university
and
some
of
them
including
several
of
the
sort
remained
friends
with
him
throughout
their
lives
moreover
he
was
rich
and
had
a
competent
wife
his
claim
to
dunwood
house
was
stronger
than
one
would
have
supposed
the
qualifications
of
pembroke
have
already
been
indicated
they
prevailed
but
under
conditions
if
things
went
wrong
he
must
promise
to
resign
in
the
first
place
said
the
headmaster
you
are
doing
so
splendidly
with
the
your
attitude
towards
the
parents
is
magnificent
i
don
t
know
how
to
replace
you
there
whereas
of
course
the
parents
of
a
boarder
of
course
said
pembroke
the
parent
of
a
boarder
who
only
had
to
remove
his
son
if
he
was
discontented
with
the
school
was
naturally
in
a
more
independent
position
than
the
parent
who
had
brought
all
his
goods
and
chattels
to
sawston
and
was
renting
a
house
there
now
the
parents
of
boarders
this
is
my
second
point
practically
demand
that
the
should
have
a
a
most
unreasonable
demand
said
pembroke
to
my
mind
also
a
bright
motherly
matron
is
quite
sufficient
but
that
is
what
they
demand
and
that
is
why
do
you
see
we
have
to
regard
your
appointment
as
experimental
possibly
miss
pembroke
will
be
able
to
help
you
or
i
don
t
know
whether
if
ever
he
left
the
sentence
unfinished
two
days
later
pembroke
proposed
to
orr
he
had
always
intended
to
marry
when
he
could
afford
it
and
once
he
had
been
in
love
violently
in
love
but
had
laid
the
passion
aside
and
told
it
to
wait
till
a
more
convenient
season
this
was
of
course
the
proper
thing
to
do
and
prudence
should
have
been
rewarded
but
when
after
the
lapse
of
fifteen
years
he
went
as
it
were
to
his
spiritual
larder
and
took
down
love
from
the
top
shelf
to
offer
him
to
orr
he
was
rather
dismayed
something
had
happened
perhaps
the
god
had
flown
perhaps
he
had
been
eaten
by
the
rats
at
all
events
he
was
not
there
pembroke
was
conscientious
and
romantic
and
knew
that
marriage
without
love
is
intolerable
on
the
other
hand
he
could
not
admit
that
love
had
vanished
from
him
to
admit
this
would
argue
that
he
had
deteriorated
whereas
he
knew
for
a
fact
that
he
had
improved
year
by
year
each
year
be
grew
more
moral
more
efficient
more
learned
more
genial
so
how
could
he
fail
to
be
more
loving
he
did
not
speak
to
himself
as
follows
because
he
never
spoke
to
himself
but
the
following
notions
moved
in
the
recesses
of
his
mind
it
is
not
the
fire
of
youth
but
i
am
not
sure
that
i
approve
of
the
fire
of
youth
look
at
my
sister
once
she
has
suffered
twice
she
has
been
most
imprudent
and
put
me
to
great
inconvenience
besides
for
if
she
was
stopping
with
me
she
would
have
done
the
housekeeping
i
rather
suspect
that
it
is
a
nobler
riper
emotion
that
i
am
laying
at
the
feet
of
it
never
took
him
long
to
get
muddled
or
to
reverse
cause
and
effect
in
a
short
time
he
believed
that
he
had
been
pining
for
years
and
only
waiting
for
this
good
fortune
to
ask
the
lady
to
share
it
with
him
orr
was
quiet
clever
kindly
capable
and
amusing
and
they
were
old
acquaintances
altogether
it
was
not
surprising
that
he
should
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
nor
very
surprising
that
she
should
refuse
but
she
refused
with
a
violence
that
alarmed
them
both
he
left
her
house
declaring
that
he
had
been
insulted
and
she
as
soon
as
he
left
passed
from
disgust
into
tears
he
was
much
annoyed
there
was
a
certain
miss
herriton
who
though
far
inferior
to
orr
would
have
done
instead
of
her
but
now
it
was
impossible
he
could
not
go
offering
himself
about
sawston
having
engaged
a
matron
who
had
the
reputation
for
being
bright
and
motherly
he
moved
into
dunwood
house
and
opened
the
michaelmas
term
everything
went
wrong
the
cook
left
the
boys
had
a
disease
called
roseola
agnes
who
was
still
drunk
with
her
engagement
was
of
no
assistance
but
kept
flying
up
to
london
to
push
rickie
s
fortunes
and
to
crown
everything
the
matron
was
too
bright
and
not
motherly
enough
she
neglected
the
little
boys
and
was
overattentive
to
the
big
ones
she
left
abruptly
and
the
voice
of
jackson
arose
prophesying
disaster
should
he
avert
it
by
taking
orders
parents
do
not
demand
that
a
should
be
a
clergyman
yet
it
reassures
them
when
he
is
and
he
would
have
to
take
orders
some
time
if
he
hoped
for
a
school
of
his
own
his
religious
convictions
were
ready
to
hand
but
he
spent
several
uncomfortable
days
hunting
up
his
religious
enthusiasms
it
was
not
unlike
his
attempt
to
marry
orr
but
his
piety
was
more
genuine
and
this
time
he
never
came
to
the
point
his
sense
of
decency
forbade
him
hurrying
into
a
church
that
he
reverenced
moreover
he
thought
of
another
solution
agnes
must
marry
rickie
in
the
christmas
holidays
and
they
must
come
both
of
them
to
sawston
she
as
housekeeper
he
as
the
girl
was
a
good
worker
when
once
she
was
settled
down
and
as
for
rickie
he
could
easily
be
fitted
in
somewhere
in
the
school
he
was
not
a
good
classic
but
good
enough
to
take
the
lower
fifth
he
was
no
athlete
but
boys
might
profitably
note
that
he
was
a
perfect
gentleman
all
the
same
he
had
no
experience
but
he
would
gain
it
he
had
no
decision
but
he
could
simulate
it
above
all
thought
pembroke
it
will
be
something
regular
for
him
to
of
course
this
was
not
above
dunwood
house
held
that
position
but
pembroke
soon
came
to
think
that
it
was
and
believed
that
he
was
planning
for
rickie
just
as
he
had
believed
he
was
pining
for
orr
agnes
when
she
got
back
from
the
lunch
in
soho
was
told
of
the
plan
she
refused
to
give
any
opinion
until
she
had
seen
her
lover
a
telegram
was
sent
to
him
and
next
morning
he
arrived
he
was
very
susceptible
to
the
weather
and
perhaps
it
was
unfortunate
that
the
morning
was
foggy
his
train
had
been
stopped
outside
sawston
station
and
there
he
had
sat
for
half
an
hour
listening
to
the
unreal
noises
that
came
from
the
line
and
watching
the
shadowy
figures
that
worked
there
the
gas
was
alight
in
the
great
and
in
its
depressing
rays
he
and
agnes
greeted
each
other
and
discussed
the
most
momentous
question
of
their
lives
they
wanted
to
be
married
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
they
wanted
it
both
of
them
dreadfully
but
should
they
marry
on
these
terms
i
d
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
you
see
when
the
scholastic
agencies
sent
me
circulars
after
the
tripos
i
tore
them
up
at
there
are
the
holidays
said
agnes
you
would
have
three
months
in
the
year
to
yourself
and
you
could
do
your
writing
but
who
ll
read
what
i
ve
written
and
he
told
her
about
the
editor
of
the
she
became
extremely
grave
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
she
had
always
mistrusted
the
little
stories
and
now
people
who
knew
agreed
with
her
how
could
rickie
or
any
one
make
a
living
by
pretending
that
greek
gods
were
alive
or
that
young
ladies
could
vanish
into
trees
a
sparkling
society
tale
full
of
verve
and
pathos
would
have
been
another
thing
and
the
editor
might
have
been
convinced
by
it
but
what
does
he
mean
rickie
was
saying
what
does
he
mean
by
life
i
know
what
he
means
but
i
can
t
exactly
explain
you
ought
to
see
life
rickie
i
think
he
s
right
there
and
tilliard
was
right
when
he
said
one
oughtn
t
to
be
he
stood
in
the
twilight
that
fell
from
the
window
she
in
the
twilight
of
the
gas
i
wonder
what
ansell
would
say
he
murmured
oh
poor
ansell
he
was
somewhat
surprised
why
was
ansell
poor
it
was
the
first
time
the
epithet
had
been
applied
to
him
but
to
change
the
conversation
said
agnes
if
we
did
marry
we
might
get
to
italy
at
easter
and
escape
this
horrible
yes
perhaps
there
perhaps
life
would
be
there
he
thought
of
renan
who
declares
that
on
the
acropolis
at
athens
beauty
and
wisdom
do
exist
really
exist
as
external
powers
he
did
not
aspire
to
beauty
or
wisdom
but
he
prayed
to
be
delivered
from
the
shadow
of
unreality
that
had
begun
to
darken
the
world
for
it
was
as
if
some
power
had
pronounced
against
him
as
if
by
some
heedless
action
he
had
offended
an
olympian
god
like
many
another
he
wondered
whether
the
god
might
be
appeased
by
work
hard
uncongenial
work
perhaps
he
had
not
worked
hard
enough
or
had
enjoyed
his
work
too
much
and
for
that
reason
the
shadow
was
falling
and
above
all
a
schoolmaster
has
wonderful
opportunities
for
doing
good
one
mustn
t
forget
to
do
good
for
what
other
reason
are
we
here
let
us
give
up
our
refined
sensations
and
our
comforts
and
our
art
if
thereby
we
can
make
other
people
happier
and
better
the
woman
he
loved
had
urged
him
to
do
good
with
a
vehemence
that
surprised
her
he
exclaimed
i
ll
do
think
it
over
she
cautioned
though
she
was
greatly
pleased
no
i
think
over
things
too
the
room
grew
brighter
a
boy
s
laughter
floated
in
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
people
were
as
important
and
vivid
as
they
had
been
six
months
before
then
he
was
at
cambridge
idling
in
the
parsley
meadows
and
weaving
perishable
garlands
out
of
flowers
now
he
was
at
sawston
preparing
to
work
a
beneficent
machine
no
man
works
for
nothing
and
rickie
trusted
that
to
him
also
benefits
might
accrue
that
his
wound
might
heal
as
he
laboured
and
his
eyes
recapture
the
holy
grail
xvii
in
practical
matters
pembroke
was
often
a
generous
man
he
offered
rickie
a
good
salary
and
insisted
on
paying
agnes
as
well
and
as
he
housed
them
for
nothing
and
as
rickie
would
also
have
a
salary
from
the
school
the
money
question
disappeared
if
not
forever
at
all
events
for
the
present
i
can
work
you
in
he
said
leave
all
that
to
me
and
in
a
few
days
you
shall
hear
from
the
headmaster
he
shall
create
a
vacancy
and
once
in
we
stand
or
fall
together
i
am
resolved
on
rickie
did
not
like
the
idea
of
being
worked
in
but
he
was
determined
to
raise
no
difficulties
it
is
so
easy
to
be
refined
and
when
we
have
nothing
to
do
but
the
active
useful
man
can
not
be
equally
particular
rickie
s
programme
involved
a
change
in
values
as
well
as
a
change
of
occupation
adopt
a
frankly
intellectual
attitude
pembroke
continued
i
do
not
advise
you
at
present
even
to
profess
any
interest
in
athletics
or
organization
when
the
headmaster
writes
he
will
probably
ask
whether
you
are
an
man
boldly
say
no
a
bold
no
is
at
times
the
best
take
your
stand
upon
classics
and
general
classics
a
second
in
the
tripos
general
culture
a
smattering
of
english
literature
and
less
than
a
smattering
of
french
that
is
how
we
begin
then
we
get
you
a
little
post
say
that
of
librarian
and
so
on
until
you
are
rickie
laughed
the
headmaster
wrote
the
reply
was
satisfactory
and
in
due
course
the
new
life
began
sawston
was
already
familiar
to
him
but
he
knew
it
as
an
amateur
and
under
an
official
gaze
it
grouped
itself
afresh
the
school
a
bland
gothic
building
now
showed
as
a
fortress
of
learning
whose
outworks
were
the
those
straggling
roads
were
full
of
the
houses
of
the
parents
of
the
these
shops
were
in
bounds
those
out
how
often
had
he
passed
dunwood
house
he
had
once
confused
it
with
its
rival
cedar
view
now
he
was
to
live
there
perhaps
for
many
years
on
the
left
of
the
entrance
a
large
saffron
full
of
cosy
corners
and
dumpy
chairs
here
the
parents
would
be
received
on
the
right
of
the
entrance
a
study
which
he
shared
with
herbert
here
the
boys
would
be
caned
he
hoped
not
often
in
the
hall
a
framed
certificate
praising
the
drains
the
bust
of
hermes
and
a
carved
teak
monkey
holding
out
a
salver
some
of
the
furniture
had
come
from
shelthorpe
some
had
been
bought
from
annison
some
of
it
was
new
but
throughout
he
recognized
a
certain
decision
of
arrangement
nothing
in
the
house
was
accidental
or
there
merely
for
its
own
sake
he
contrasted
it
with
his
room
at
cambridge
which
had
been
a
jumble
of
things
that
he
loved
dearly
and
of
things
that
he
did
not
love
at
all
now
these
also
had
come
to
dunwood
house
and
had
been
distributed
where
each
was
seemly
sir
percival
to
the
the
photograph
of
stockholm
to
the
passage
his
chair
his
inkpot
and
the
portrait
of
his
mother
to
the
study
and
then
he
contrasted
it
with
the
ansells
house
to
which
their
resolute
had
given
unity
he
was
extremely
sensitive
to
the
inside
of
a
house
holding
it
an
organism
that
expressed
the
thoughts
conscious
and
subconscious
of
its
inmates
he
was
equally
sensitive
to
places
he
would
compare
cambridge
with
sawston
and
either
with
a
third
type
of
existence
to
which
for
want
of
a
better
name
he
gave
the
name
of
it
must
not
be
thought
that
he
is
going
to
waste
his
time
these
contrasts
and
comparisons
never
took
him
long
and
he
never
indulged
in
them
until
the
serious
business
of
the
day
was
over
and
as
time
passed
he
never
indulged
in
them
at
all
the
school
returned
at
the
end
of
january
before
he
had
been
settled
in
a
week
his
health
had
improved
but
not
greatly
and
he
was
nervous
at
the
prospect
of
confronting
the
assembled
house
all
day
long
cabs
had
been
driving
up
full
of
boys
in
bowler
hats
too
big
for
them
and
agnes
had
been
superintending
the
numbering
of
the
said
hats
and
the
placing
of
them
in
cupboards
since
they
would
not
be
wanted
till
the
end
of
the
term
each
boy
had
or
should
have
had
a
bag
so
that
he
need
not
unpack
his
box
till
the
morrow
one
boy
had
only
a
parcel
tied
with
hairy
string
and
rickie
heard
the
firm
pleasant
voice
say
but
you
ll
bring
a
bag
next
term
and
the
submissive
yes
elliot
of
the
reply
in
the
passage
he
ran
against
the
head
boy
who
was
alarmingly
like
an
undergraduate
they
looked
at
each
other
suspiciously
and
parted
two
minutes
later
he
ran
into
another
boy
and
then
into
another
and
began
to
wonder
whether
they
were
doing
it
on
purpose
and
if
so
whether
he
ought
to
mind
as
the
day
wore
on
the
noises
grew
of
feet
breakdowns
jolly
little
squawks
and
the
cubicles
were
assigned
and
the
bags
unpacked
and
the
bathing
arrangements
posted
up
and
herbert
kept
on
saying
all
this
is
informal
all
this
is
informal
we
shall
meet
the
house
at
eight
and
so
at
eight
ten
rickie
put
on
his
cap
and
gown
hitherto
symbols
of
pupilage
now
to
be
symbols
of
dignity
the
very
cap
and
gown
that
widdrington
had
so
recently
hung
upon
the
college
fountain
herbert
similarly
attired
was
waiting
for
him
in
their
private
where
also
sat
agnes
ravenously
devouring
scrambled
eggs
but
you
ll
wear
your
hoods
she
cried
herbert
considered
and
them
said
she
was
quite
right
he
fetched
his
white
silk
rickie
the
fragment
of
rabbit
s
wool
that
marks
the
degree
of
thus
attired
they
proceeded
through
the
baize
door
they
were
a
little
late
and
the
boys
who
were
marshalled
in
the
preparation
room
were
getting
uproarious
one
forgetting
how
far
his
voice
carried
shouted
cave
here
comes
the
and
another
young
devil
yelled
the
whelk
s
brought
a
pet
with
him
you
mustn
t
mind
said
herbert
kindly
we
masters
make
a
point
of
never
minding
nicknames
unless
of
course
they
are
applied
openly
in
which
case
a
thousand
lines
is
not
too
rickie
assented
and
they
entered
the
preparation
room
just
as
the
prefects
had
established
order
here
herbert
took
his
seat
on
a
chair
while
rickie
like
a
sat
near
him
on
a
chair
with
somewhat
shorter
legs
each
chair
had
a
desk
attached
to
it
and
herbert
flung
up
the
lid
of
his
and
then
looked
round
the
preparation
room
with
a
quick
frown
as
if
the
contents
had
surprised
him
so
impressed
was
rickie
that
he
peeped
sideways
but
could
only
see
a
little
in
the
desk
then
he
noticed
that
the
boys
were
impressed
too
their
chatter
ceased
they
attended
the
room
was
almost
full
the
prefects
instead
of
lolling
disdainfully
in
the
back
row
were
ranged
like
councillors
beneath
the
central
throne
this
was
an
innovation
of
pembroke
s
carruthers
the
head
boy
sat
in
the
middle
with
his
arm
round
lloyd
it
was
lloyd
who
had
made
the
matron
too
bright
he
nearly
lost
his
colours
in
consequence
these
two
were
grown
up
beside
them
sat
tewson
a
saintly
child
in
the
spectacles
who
had
risen
to
this
height
by
reason
of
his
immense
learning
he
like
the
others
was
a
school
prefect
the
house
prefects
an
inferior
brand
were
beyond
and
behind
came
the
indistinguishable
many
the
faces
all
looked
alike
as
yet
except
the
face
of
one
boy
who
was
inclined
to
cry
school
said
pembroke
slowly
closing
the
lid
of
the
desk
school
is
the
world
in
then
he
paused
as
a
man
well
may
who
has
made
such
a
remark
it
is
not
however
the
intention
of
this
work
to
quote
an
opening
address
rickie
at
all
events
refused
to
be
critical
herbert
s
experience
was
far
greater
than
his
and
he
must
take
his
tone
from
him
nor
could
any
one
criticize
the
exhortations
to
be
patriotic
athletic
learned
and
religious
that
flowed
like
a
fugue
from
pembroke
s
mouth
he
was
a
practised
speaker
that
is
to
say
he
held
his
audience
s
attention
he
told
them
that
this
term
the
second
of
his
reign
was
the
term
for
dunwood
house
that
it
behooved
every
boy
to
labour
during
it
for
his
house
s
honour
and
through
the
house
for
the
honour
of
the
school
taking
a
wider
range
he
spoke
of
england
or
rather
of
great
britain
and
of
her
continental
foes
portraits
of
hung
on
the
wall
and
he
pointed
to
them
he
quoted
imperial
poets
he
showed
how
patriotism
had
broadened
since
the
days
of
shakespeare
who
for
all
his
genius
could
only
write
of
his
country
as
this
fortress
built
by
nature
for
herself
against
infection
and
the
hand
of
war
this
hazy
breed
of
men
this
little
world
this
precious
stone
set
in
the
silver
and
it
seemed
that
only
a
short
ladder
lay
between
the
preparation
room
and
the
hegemony
of
the
globe
then
he
paused
and
in
the
silence
came
sob
sob
sob
from
a
little
boy
who
was
regretting
a
villa
in
guildford
and
his
mother
s
half
acre
of
garden
the
proceeding
terminated
with
the
broader
patriotism
of
the
school
anthem
recently
composed
by
the
organist
words
and
tune
were
still
a
matter
for
taste
and
it
was
pembroke
and
he
only
because
he
had
the
music
who
gave
the
right
intonation
to
perish
each
laggard
let
it
not
be
said
that
sawston
such
within
her
walls
hath
come
come
he
said
pleasantly
as
they
ended
with
harmonies
in
the
style
of
richard
strauss
this
will
never
do
we
must
grapple
with
the
anthem
this
term
you
re
as
tuneful
as
as
hearty
laughter
and
then
the
whole
house
filed
past
them
and
shook
hands
but
how
did
it
impress
you
herbert
asked
as
soon
as
they
were
back
in
their
own
part
agnes
had
provided
them
with
a
tray
of
food
the
meals
were
still
anyhow
and
she
had
to
fly
at
once
to
see
after
the
boys
i
liked
the
look
of
i
meant
rather
how
did
the
house
impress
you
as
a
house
i
don
t
think
i
thought
said
rickie
rather
nervously
it
is
not
easy
to
catch
the
spirit
of
a
thing
at
once
i
only
saw
a
roomful
of
my
dear
rickie
don
t
be
so
diffident
you
are
perfectly
right
you
only
did
see
a
roomful
of
boys
as
yet
there
s
nothing
else
to
see
the
house
like
the
school
lacks
tradition
look
at
winchester
look
at
the
traditional
rivalry
between
eton
and
harrow
tradition
is
of
incalculable
importance
if
a
school
is
to
have
any
status
why
should
sawston
be
without
yes
tradition
is
of
incalculable
value
and
i
envy
those
schools
that
have
a
natural
connection
with
the
past
of
course
sawston
has
a
past
though
not
of
the
kind
that
you
quite
want
the
sons
of
poor
tradesmen
went
to
it
at
first
so
wouldn
t
its
traditions
be
more
likely
to
linger
in
the
commercial
school
he
concluded
nervously
you
have
a
great
deal
to
learn
a
very
great
deal
listen
to
me
why
has
sawston
no
traditions
his
round
rather
foolish
face
assumed
the
expression
of
a
conspirator
bending
over
the
mutton
he
whispered
i
can
tell
you
why
owing
to
the
how
can
traditions
flourish
in
such
soil
picture
the
s
life
at
home
for
meals
at
home
for
preparation
at
home
for
sleep
running
home
with
every
fancied
wrong
there
are
in
your
class
and
mark
my
words
they
will
give
you
ten
times
as
much
trouble
as
the
boarders
late
slovenly
stopping
away
at
the
slightest
pretext
and
then
the
letters
from
the
parents
why
has
my
boy
not
been
moved
this
term
why
has
my
boy
been
moved
this
term
i
am
a
dissenter
and
do
not
wish
my
boy
to
subscribe
to
the
school
can
you
let
my
boy
off
early
to
water
the
garden
remember
that
i
have
been
a
and
tried
to
infuse
some
esprit
de
corps
into
them
it
is
practically
impossible
they
come
as
units
and
units
they
remain
worse
they
infect
the
boarders
their
pestilential
critical
discontented
attitude
is
spreading
over
the
school
if
i
had
my
own
way
he
stopped
somewhat
abruptly
was
that
why
you
laughed
at
their
singing
not
at
all
not
at
all
it
is
not
my
habit
to
set
one
section
of
the
school
against
the
after
a
little
they
went
the
rounds
the
boys
were
in
bed
now
called
herbert
standing
in
the
corridor
of
the
cubicles
and
from
behind
each
of
the
green
curtains
came
the
sound
of
a
voice
replying
sir
he
observed
into
each
dormitory
then
he
went
to
the
switch
in
the
passage
and
plunged
the
whole
house
into
darkness
rickie
lingered
behind
him
strangely
impressed
in
the
morning
those
boys
had
been
scattered
over
england
leading
their
own
lives
now
for
three
months
they
must
change
everything
see
new
faces
accept
new
ideals
they
like
himself
must
enter
a
beneficent
machine
and
learn
the
value
of
esprit
de
corps
good
luck
attend
them
good
luck
and
a
happy
release
for
his
heart
would
have
them
not
in
these
cubicles
and
dormitories
but
each
in
his
own
dear
home
amongst
faces
and
things
that
he
knew
next
morning
after
chapel
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
his
class
towards
that
he
felt
very
differently
esprit
de
corps
was
not
expected
of
it
it
was
simply
two
dozen
boys
who
were
gathered
together
for
the
purpose
of
learning
latin
his
duties
and
difficulties
would
not
lie
here
he
was
not
required
to
provide
it
with
an
atmosphere
the
scheme
of
work
was
already
mapped
out
and
he
started
gaily
upon
familiar
words
pan
ovium
custos
tua
si
tibi
maenala
curae
adsis
o
tegaee
do
you
think
that
beautiful
he
asked
and
received
the
honest
answer
no
sir
i
don
t
think
i
he
met
herbert
in
high
spirits
in
the
quadrangle
during
the
interval
but
herbert
thought
his
enthusiasm
rather
amateurish
and
cautioned
him
you
must
take
care
they
don
t
get
out
of
hand
i
approve
of
a
lively
teacher
but
discipline
must
be
established
i
felt
myself
a
learner
not
a
teacher
if
i
m
wrong
over
a
point
or
don
t
know
i
mean
to
tell
them
at
herbert
shook
his
head
it
s
different
if
i
was
really
a
scholar
but
i
can
t
pose
as
one
can
i
i
know
much
more
than
the
boys
but
i
know
very
little
surely
the
honest
thing
is
to
be
myself
to
them
let
them
accept
or
refuse
me
as
that
that
s
the
only
attitude
we
shall
any
of
us
profit
by
in
the
pembroke
was
silent
then
he
observed
there
is
as
you
say
a
higher
attitude
and
a
lower
attitude
yet
here
as
so
often
can
not
we
find
a
golden
mean
between
them
what
s
that
said
a
dreamy
voice
they
turned
and
saw
a
tall
spectacled
man
who
greeted
the
newcomer
kindly
and
took
hold
of
his
arm
what
s
that
about
the
golden
mean
mr
jackson
elliot
elliot
jackson
said
herbert
who
did
not
seem
quite
pleased
rickie
have
you
a
moment
to
spare
me
but
the
humanist
spoke
to
the
young
man
about
the
golden
mean
and
the
pinchbeck
mean
adding
you
know
the
greeks
aren
t
broad
church
clergymen
they
really
aren
t
in
spite
of
much
conflicting
evidence
boys
will
regard
sophocles
as
a
kind
of
enlightened
bishop
and
something
tells
me
that
they
are
mr
jackson
is
a
classical
enthusiast
said
herbert
he
makes
the
past
live
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
the
humdrum
and
i
am
warning
him
against
the
humdrum
past
that
s
another
point
elliot
impress
on
your
class
that
many
greeks
and
most
romans
were
frightfully
stupid
and
if
they
disbelieve
you
read
ctesiphon
with
them
or
valerius
flaccus
whatever
is
that
noise
it
comes
from
your
i
think
snapped
the
other
master
so
it
does
ah
yes
i
expect
they
are
putting
your
little
tewson
into
the
i
always
lock
my
in
the
interval
yes
and
carry
the
key
in
my
ah
but
elliot
i
am
a
cousin
of
widdrington
s
he
wrote
to
me
about
you
i
am
so
glad
will
you
first
of
all
come
to
supper
next
sunday
i
am
afraid
put
in
herbert
that
we
poor
housemasters
must
deny
ourselves
festivities
in
term
but
mayn
t
he
come
once
just
once
may
my
dear
jackson
my
is
not
a
baby
he
decides
for
rickie
naturally
refused
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
hearing
herbert
said
this
is
a
little
unfortunate
who
is
widdrington
i
knew
him
at
let
me
explain
how
we
stand
he
continued
after
a
pause
jackson
is
the
worst
of
the
reactionaries
here
while
i
why
should
i
conceal
it
have
thrown
in
my
lot
with
the
party
of
progress
you
will
see
how
we
suffer
from
him
at
the
masters
meetings
he
has
no
talent
for
organization
and
yet
he
is
always
inflicting
his
ideas
on
others
it
was
like
his
impertinence
to
dictate
to
you
what
authors
you
should
read
and
meanwhile
the
room
like
a
and
a
school
prefect
being
put
into
the
basket
my
good
rickie
there
s
nothing
to
smile
at
how
is
the
school
to
go
on
with
a
man
like
that
it
would
be
a
case
of
quick
march
if
it
was
not
for
his
brilliant
intellect
that
s
why
i
say
it
s
a
little
unfortunate
you
will
have
very
little
in
common
you
and
rickie
did
not
answer
he
was
very
fond
of
widdrington
who
was
a
quaint
sensitive
person
and
he
could
not
help
being
attracted
by
jackson
whose
welcome
contrasted
pleasantly
with
the
official
breeziness
of
his
other
colleagues
he
wondered
too
whether
it
is
so
very
reactionary
to
contemplate
the
antique
it
is
true
that
i
vote
conservative
pursued
pembroke
apparently
confronting
some
objector
but
why
because
the
conservatives
rather
than
the
liberals
stand
for
progress
one
must
not
be
misled
by
didn
t
you
want
to
ask
me
something
ah
yes
you
found
a
boy
in
your
form
called
varden
varden
yes
there
drop
on
him
heavily
he
has
broken
the
statutes
of
the
school
he
is
attending
as
a
the
statutes
provide
that
a
boy
must
reside
with
his
parents
or
guardians
he
does
neither
it
must
be
stopped
you
must
tell
the
where
does
the
boy
live
at
a
certain
orr
s
who
has
no
connection
with
the
school
of
any
kind
it
must
be
stopped
he
must
either
enter
a
or
but
why
should
i
tell
said
rickie
he
remembered
the
boy
an
unattractive
person
with
protruding
ears
it
is
the
business
of
his
exactly
here
we
come
back
again
who
is
now
the
jackson
once
again
as
if
anything
was
jackson
s
business
i
handed
the
house
back
last
term
in
a
most
flourishing
condition
it
has
already
gone
to
rack
and
ruin
for
the
second
time
to
return
to
varden
i
have
unearthed
a
job
jackson
and
orr
are
friends
do
you
see
it
all
works
i
see
it
does
or
the
headmaster
will
never
sanction
it
when
it
s
put
to
him
but
why
should
i
put
it
said
rickie
twisting
the
ribbons
of
his
gown
round
his
fingers
because
you
re
the
boy
s
is
that
a
reason
of
course
it
i
only
wondered
whether
he
did
not
like
to
say
that
he
wondered
whether
he
need
do
it
his
first
morning
by
some
means
or
other
you
must
find
out
of
course
you
know
already
but
you
must
find
out
from
the
boy
i
know
i
have
it
where
s
his
health
certificate
he
had
forgotten
just
like
them
well
when
he
brings
it
it
will
be
signed
by
orr
and
you
must
look
at
it
and
say
orr
orr
orr
or
something
to
that
effect
and
then
the
whole
thing
will
come
naturally
the
bell
rang
and
they
went
in
for
the
hour
of
school
that
concluded
the
morning
varden
brought
his
health
certificate
a
pompous
document
asserting
that
he
had
not
suffered
from
roseola
or
kindred
ailments
in
the
holidays
and
for
a
long
time
rickie
sat
with
it
before
him
spread
open
upon
his
desk
he
did
not
quite
like
the
job
it
suggested
intrigue
and
he
had
come
to
sawston
not
to
intrigue
but
to
labour
doubtless
herbert
was
right
and
jackson
and
orr
were
wrong
but
why
could
they
not
have
it
out
among
themselves
then
he
thought
i
am
a
coward
and
that
s
why
i
m
raising
these
objections
called
the
boy
up
to
him
and
it
did
all
come
out
naturally
more
or
less
hitherto
varden
had
lived
with
his
mother
but
she
had
left
sawston
at
christmas
and
now
he
would
live
with
orr
mr
jackson
sir
said
it
would
be
all
yes
yes
said
rickie
quite
he
remembered
herbert
s
dictum
masters
must
present
a
united
front
if
they
do
not
the
he
sent
the
boy
back
to
his
seat
and
after
school
took
the
compromising
health
certificate
to
the
headmaster
the
headmaster
was
at
that
time
easily
excited
by
a
breach
of
the
constitution
parents
or
guardians
he
reputed
parents
or
guardians
and
flew
with
those
words
on
his
lips
to
jackson
to
say
that
rickie
was
a
cat
is
to
put
it
too
strongly
herbert
was
strictly
honourable
and
never
pushed
him
into
an
illegal
or
really
dangerous
position
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
on
this
and
on
many
other
occasions
he
had
to
do
things
that
he
would
not
otherwise
have
done
there
was
always
some
diplomatic
corner
that
had
to
be
turned
always
something
that
he
had
to
say
or
not
to
say
as
the
term
wore
on
he
lost
his
independence
almost
without
knowing
it
he
had
much
to
learn
about
boys
and
he
learnt
not
by
direct
observation
for
which
he
believed
he
was
unfitted
but
by
sedulous
imitation
of
the
more
experienced
masters
originally
he
had
intended
to
be
friends
with
his
pupils
and
pembroke
commended
the
intention
highly
but
you
can
not
be
friends
either
with
boy
or
man
unless
you
give
yourself
away
in
the
process
and
pembroke
did
not
commend
this
he
for
personal
intercourse
substituted
the
safer
personal
influence
and
gave
his
junior
hints
on
the
setting
of
kindly
traps
in
which
the
boy
does
give
himself
away
and
reveals
his
shy
delicate
thoughts
while
the
master
intact
commends
or
corrects
them
originally
rickie
had
meant
to
help
boys
in
the
anxieties
that
they
undergo
when
changing
into
men
at
cambridge
he
had
numbered
this
among
life
s
duties
but
here
is
a
subject
in
which
we
must
inevitably
speak
as
one
human
being
to
another
not
as
one
who
has
authority
or
the
shadow
of
authority
and
for
this
reason
the
elder
could
suggest
nothing
but
a
few
formulae
formulae
like
kindly
traps
were
not
in
rickie
s
line
so
he
abandoned
these
subjects
altogether
and
confined
himself
to
working
hard
at
what
was
easy
in
the
house
he
did
as
herbert
did
and
referred
all
doubtful
subjects
to
him
in
his
form
oddly
enough
he
became
a
martinet
it
is
so
much
simpler
to
be
severe
he
grasped
the
school
regulations
and
insisted
on
prompt
obedience
to
them
he
adopted
the
doctrine
of
collective
responsibility
when
one
boy
was
late
he
punished
the
whole
form
i
can
t
help
it
he
would
say
as
if
he
was
a
power
of
nature
as
a
teacher
he
was
rather
dull
he
curbed
his
own
enthusiasms
finding
that
they
distracted
his
attention
and
that
while
he
throbbed
to
the
music
of
virgil
the
boys
in
the
back
row
were
getting
unruly
but
on
the
whole
he
liked
his
form
work
he
knew
why
he
was
there
and
herbert
did
not
overshadow
him
so
completely
what
was
amiss
with
herbert
he
had
known
that
something
was
amiss
and
had
entered
into
partnership
with
open
eyes
the
man
was
kind
and
unselfish
more
than
that
he
was
truly
charitable
and
it
was
a
real
pleasure
to
him
to
give
pleasure
to
others
certainly
he
might
talk
too
much
about
it
afterwards
but
it
was
the
doing
not
the
talking
that
he
really
valued
and
benefactors
of
this
sort
are
not
too
common
he
was
moreover
diligent
and
conscientious
his
heart
was
in
his
work
and
his
adherence
to
the
church
of
england
no
mere
matter
of
form
he
was
capable
of
affection
he
was
usually
courteous
and
tolerant
then
what
was
amiss
why
in
spite
of
all
these
qualities
should
rickie
feel
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
him
nay
that
he
was
wrong
as
a
whole
and
that
if
the
spirit
of
humanity
should
ever
hold
a
judgment
he
would
assuredly
be
classed
among
the
goats
the
answer
at
first
sight
appeared
a
graceless
one
it
was
that
herbert
was
stupid
not
stupid
in
the
ordinary
sense
he
had
a
brain
and
acquired
knowledge
easily
but
stupid
in
the
important
sense
his
whole
life
was
coloured
by
a
contempt
of
the
intellect
that
he
had
a
tolerable
intellect
of
his
own
was
not
the
point
it
is
in
what
we
value
not
in
what
we
have
that
the
test
of
us
resides
now
rickie
s
intellect
was
not
remarkable
he
came
to
his
worthier
results
rather
by
imagination
and
instinct
than
by
logic
an
argument
confused
him
and
he
could
with
difficulty
follow
it
even
on
paper
but
he
saw
in
this
no
reason
for
satisfaction
and
tried
to
make
such
use
of
his
brain
as
he
could
just
as
a
weak
athlete
might
lovingly
exercise
his
body
like
a
weak
athlete
too
he
loved
to
watch
the
exploits
or
rather
the
efforts
of
others
their
efforts
not
so
much
to
acquire
knowledge
as
to
dispel
a
little
of
the
darkness
by
which
we
and
all
our
acquisitions
are
surrounded
cambridge
had
taught
him
this
and
he
knew
if
for
no
other
reason
that
his
time
there
had
not
been
in
vain
and
herbert
s
contempt
for
such
efforts
revolted
him
he
saw
that
for
all
his
fine
talk
about
a
spiritual
life
he
had
but
one
test
for
things
success
success
for
the
body
in
this
life
or
for
the
soul
in
the
life
to
come
and
for
this
reason
humanity
and
perhaps
such
other
tribunals
as
there
may
be
would
assuredly
reject
him
xviii
meanwhile
he
was
a
husband
perhaps
his
union
should
have
been
emphasized
before
the
crown
of
life
had
been
attained
the
vague
yearnings
the
misread
impulses
had
found
accomplishment
at
last
never
again
must
he
feel
lonely
or
as
one
who
stands
out
of
the
broad
highway
of
the
world
and
fears
like
poor
shelley
to
undertake
the
longest
journey
so
he
reasoned
and
at
first
took
the
accomplishment
for
granted
but
as
the
term
passed
he
knew
that
behind
the
yearning
there
remained
a
yearning
behind
the
drawn
veil
a
veil
that
he
could
not
draw
his
wedding
had
been
no
mighty
landmark
he
would
often
wonder
whether
such
and
such
a
speech
or
incident
came
after
it
or
before
since
that
meeting
in
the
soho
restaurant
there
had
been
so
much
to
do
clothes
to
buy
presents
to
thank
for
a
brief
visit
to
a
training
college
a
honeymoon
as
brief
in
such
a
bustle
what
spiritual
union
could
take
place
surely
the
dust
would
settle
soon
in
italy
at
easter
he
might
perceive
the
infinities
of
love
but
love
had
shown
him
its
infinities
already
neither
by
marriage
nor
by
any
other
device
can
men
insure
themselves
a
vision
and
rickie
s
had
been
granted
him
three
years
before
when
he
had
seen
his
wife
and
a
dead
man
clasped
in
each
other
s
arms
she
was
never
to
be
so
real
to
him
again
she
ran
about
the
house
looking
handsomer
than
ever
her
cheerful
voice
gave
orders
to
the
servants
as
he
sat
in
the
study
correcting
compositions
she
would
dart
in
and
give
him
a
kiss
dear
girl
he
would
murmur
with
a
glance
at
the
rings
on
her
hand
the
tone
of
their
marriage
life
was
soon
set
it
was
to
be
a
frank
and
before
long
he
found
it
difficult
to
speak
in
a
deeper
key
one
evening
he
made
the
effort
there
had
been
more
beauty
than
was
usual
at
sawston
the
air
was
pure
and
quiet
tomorrow
the
fog
might
be
here
but
today
one
said
it
is
like
the
arm
in
arm
they
strolled
in
the
stopping
at
times
to
notice
the
crocuses
or
to
wonder
when
the
daffodils
would
flower
suddenly
he
tightened
his
pressure
and
said
darling
why
don
t
you
still
wear
she
laughed
my
taste
has
improved
so
after
all
they
never
mentioned
gerald
s
name
but
he
hoped
it
was
still
dear
to
her
he
did
not
want
her
to
forget
the
greatest
moment
in
her
life
his
love
desired
not
ownership
but
confidence
and
to
a
love
so
pure
it
does
not
seem
terrible
to
come
second
he
valued
emotion
not
for
itself
but
because
it
is
the
only
final
path
to
intimacy
she
ever
robust
and
practical
always
discouraged
him
she
was
not
cold
she
would
willingly
embrace
him
but
she
hated
being
upset
and
would
laugh
or
thrust
him
off
when
his
voice
grew
serious
in
this
she
reminded
him
of
his
mother
but
his
mother
he
had
never
concealed
it
from
himself
had
glories
to
which
his
wife
would
never
attain
glories
that
had
unfolded
against
a
life
of
horror
a
life
even
more
horrible
than
he
had
guessed
he
thought
of
her
often
during
these
earlier
months
did
she
bless
his
union
so
different
to
her
own
did
she
love
his
wife
he
tried
to
speak
of
her
to
agnes
but
again
she
was
reluctant
and
perhaps
it
was
this
aversion
to
acknowledge
the
dead
whose
images
alone
have
immortality
that
made
her
own
image
somewhat
transient
so
that
when
he
left
her
no
mystic
influence
remained
and
only
by
an
effort
could
he
realize
that
god
had
united
them
forever
they
conversed
and
differed
healthily
upon
other
topics
a
rifle
corps
was
to
be
formed
she
hoped
that
the
boys
would
have
proper
uniforms
instead
of
shooting
in
their
old
clothes
as
jackson
had
suggested
there
was
tewson
could
nothing
be
done
about
him
he
would
slink
away
from
the
other
prefects
and
go
with
boys
of
his
own
age
there
was
lloyd
he
would
not
learn
the
school
anthem
saying
that
it
hurt
his
throat
and
above
all
there
was
varden
who
to
rickie
s
bewilderment
was
now
a
member
of
dunwood
house
he
had
to
go
somewhere
said
agnes
lucky
for
his
mother
that
we
had
a
yes
but
when
i
meet
orr
i
can
t
help
feeling
oh
orr
who
cares
for
her
her
teeth
are
drawn
if
she
chooses
to
insinuate
that
we
planned
it
let
her
hers
was
rank
dishonesty
she
attempted
to
set
up
a
orr
who
was
quite
rich
had
attempted
no
such
thing
she
had
taken
the
boy
out
of
charity
and
without
a
thought
of
being
unconstitutional
but
in
had
come
this
officious
limpet
and
upset
the
headmaster
and
she
was
scolded
and
varden
was
scolded
and
jackson
was
scolded
and
the
boy
was
scolded
and
placed
with
pembroke
whom
she
revered
less
than
any
man
in
the
world
naturally
enough
she
considered
it
a
further
attempt
of
the
authorities
to
snub
the
for
whose
advantage
the
school
had
been
founded
she
and
jackson
discussed
the
subject
at
their
and
the
latter
lady
was
sure
that
no
good
no
good
of
any
kind
would
come
to
dunwood
house
from
such
plunder
we
say
let
them
talk
persisted
rickie
but
i
never
did
like
letting
people
talk
we
are
right
and
they
are
wrong
but
i
wish
the
thing
could
have
been
done
more
quietly
the
headmaster
does
get
so
excited
he
has
given
a
gang
of
foolish
people
their
opportunity
i
don
t
like
being
branded
as
the
s
foe
when
i
think
how
much
i
would
have
given
to
be
a
myself
my
father
found
me
a
nuisance
and
put
me
through
the
mill
and
i
can
never
forget
it
particularly
the
there
s
very
little
bullying
here
said
agnes
there
was
very
little
bullying
at
my
school
there
was
simply
the
atmosphere
of
unkindness
which
no
discipline
can
dispel
it
s
not
what
people
do
to
you
but
what
they
mean
that
i
don
t
physical
pain
doesn
t
hurt
at
least
not
what
i
call
hurt
if
a
man
hits
you
by
accident
or
play
but
just
a
little
tap
when
you
know
it
comes
from
hatred
is
too
terrible
boys
do
hate
each
other
i
remember
it
and
see
it
again
they
can
make
strong
isolated
friendships
but
of
general
they
haven
t
a
all
i
know
is
there
s
very
little
bullying
you
see
the
notion
of
develops
late
you
can
just
see
its
beginning
here
among
the
prefects
up
at
cambridge
it
flourishes
amazingly
that
s
why
i
pity
people
who
don
t
go
up
to
cambridge
not
because
a
university
is
smart
but
because
those
are
the
magic
years
and
with
luck
you
see
up
there
what
you
couldn
t
see
before
and
mayn
t
ever
see
again
aren
t
these
the
magic
years
the
lady
demanded
he
laughed
and
hit
at
her
i
m
getting
somewhat
involved
but
hear
me
o
agnes
for
i
am
practical
i
approve
of
our
public
schools
long
may
they
flourish
but
i
do
not
approve
of
the
system
it
isn
t
an
inevitable
adjunct
good
gracious
me
she
shrieked
have
you
gone
mad
silence
madam
don
t
betray
me
to
herbert
or
i
ll
give
us
the
sack
but
seriously
what
is
the
good
of
throwing
boys
so
much
together
isn
t
it
building
their
lives
on
a
wrong
basis
they
don
t
understand
each
other
i
wish
they
did
but
they
don
t
they
don
t
realize
that
human
beings
are
simply
marvellous
when
they
do
the
whole
of
life
changes
and
you
get
the
true
thing
but
don
t
pretend
you
ve
got
it
before
you
have
patriotism
and
esprit
de
corps
are
all
very
well
but
masters
a
little
forget
that
they
must
grow
from
sentiment
they
can
not
create
one
can
not
can
not
can
not
i
never
cared
a
straw
for
england
until
i
cared
for
englishmen
and
boys
can
t
love
the
school
when
they
hate
each
other
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
will
now
conclude
my
address
and
most
of
it
is
copied
out
of
the
truth
is
he
was
suddenly
ashamed
he
had
been
carried
away
on
the
flood
of
his
old
emotions
cambridge
and
all
that
it
meant
had
stood
before
him
passionately
clear
and
beside
it
stood
his
mother
and
the
sweet
family
life
which
nurses
up
a
boy
until
he
can
salute
his
equals
he
was
ashamed
for
he
remembered
his
new
resolution
to
work
without
criticizing
to
throw
himself
vigorously
into
the
machine
not
to
mind
if
he
was
pinched
now
and
then
by
the
elaborate
wheels
mr
ansell
cried
his
wife
laughing
somewhat
shrilly
aha
now
i
understand
it
s
just
the
kind
of
thing
poor
ansell
would
say
well
i
m
brutal
i
believe
it
does
varden
good
to
have
his
ears
pulled
now
and
then
and
i
don
t
care
whether
they
pull
them
in
play
or
not
boys
ought
to
rough
it
or
they
never
grow
up
into
men
and
your
mother
would
have
agreed
with
me
oh
yes
and
you
re
all
wrong
about
patriotism
it
can
can
create
a
she
was
unusually
precise
and
had
followed
his
thoughts
with
an
attention
that
was
also
unusual
he
wondered
whether
she
was
not
right
and
regretted
that
she
proceeded
to
say
my
dear
boy
you
mustn
t
talk
these
heresies
inside
dunwood
house
you
sound
just
like
one
of
that
reactionary
jackson
set
who
want
to
fling
the
school
back
a
hundred
years
and
have
nothing
but
all
dressed
the
jackson
set
have
their
you
d
better
join
the
dunwood
house
set
has
its
for
rickie
suffered
from
the
primal
curse
which
is
not
as
the
authorized
version
suggests
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
but
the
knowledge
of
then
stick
to
the
dunwood
house
i
do
and
again
he
was
ashamed
why
would
he
see
the
other
side
of
things
he
rebuked
his
soul
not
unsuccessfully
and
then
they
returned
to
the
subject
of
varden
i
m
certain
he
suffers
said
he
for
she
would
do
nothing
but
laugh
each
boy
who
passes
pulls
his
ears
very
funny
no
doubt
but
every
day
they
stick
out
more
and
get
redder
and
this
afternoon
when
he
didn
t
know
he
was
being
watched
he
was
holding
his
head
and
moaning
i
hate
the
look
about
his
i
hate
the
whole
boy
nasty
weedy
well
i
m
a
nasty
weedy
thing
if
it
comes
to
no
you
aren
t
she
cried
kissing
him
but
he
led
her
back
to
the
subject
could
nothing
be
suggested
he
drew
up
some
new
rules
alterations
in
the
times
of
going
to
bed
and
so
on
the
effect
of
which
would
be
to
provide
fewer
opportunities
for
the
pulling
of
varden
s
ears
the
rules
were
submitted
to
herbert
who
sympathized
with
weakliness
more
than
did
his
sister
and
gave
them
his
careful
consideration
but
unfortunately
they
collided
with
other
rules
and
on
a
closer
examination
he
found
that
they
also
ran
contrary
to
the
fundamentals
on
which
the
government
of
dunwood
house
was
based
so
nothing
was
done
agnes
was
rather
pleased
and
took
to
teasing
her
husband
about
varden
at
last
he
asked
her
to
stop
he
felt
uneasy
about
the
boy
almost
superstitious
his
first
morning
s
work
had
brought
sixty
pounds
a
year
to
their
hotel
xix
they
did
not
get
to
italy
at
easter
herbert
had
the
offer
of
some
private
pupils
and
needed
rickie
s
help
it
seemed
unreasonable
to
leave
england
when
money
was
to
be
made
in
it
so
they
went
to
ilfracombe
instead
they
spent
three
weeks
among
the
natural
advantages
and
unnatural
disadvantages
of
that
resort
it
was
out
of
the
season
and
they
encamped
in
a
huge
hotel
which
took
them
at
a
reduction
by
a
disastrous
chance
the
jacksons
were
down
there
too
and
a
good
deal
of
constrained
civility
had
to
pass
between
the
two
families
constrained
it
was
not
in
jackson
s
case
at
all
times
he
was
ready
to
talk
and
as
long
as
they
kept
off
the
school
it
was
pleasant
enough
but
he
was
very
indiscreet
and
feminine
tact
had
often
to
intervene
go
away
dear
ladies
he
would
then
observe
you
think
you
see
life
because
you
see
the
chasms
in
it
yet
all
the
chasms
are
full
of
female
the
ladies
smiled
anxiously
to
rickie
he
was
friendly
and
even
intimate
they
had
long
talks
on
the
deserted
capstone
while
their
wives
sat
reading
in
the
winter
garden
and
pembroke
kept
an
eye
upon
the
tutored
youths
once
i
had
tutored
youths
said
jackson
but
i
lost
them
all
by
letting
them
paddle
with
my
nieces
it
is
so
impossible
to
remember
what
is
and
sooner
or
later
their
talk
gravitated
towards
his
central
passion
the
fragments
of
sophocles
some
day
never
said
herbert
he
would
edit
them
at
present
they
were
merely
in
his
blood
with
the
zeal
of
a
scholar
and
the
imagination
of
a
poet
he
reconstructed
lost
dramas
niobe
phaedra
philoctetes
against
troy
whose
names
but
for
an
accident
would
have
thrilled
the
world
is
it
worth
it
he
cried
had
we
better
be
planting
potatoes
and
then
we
had
but
this
is
the
second
agnes
did
not
approve
of
these
colloquies
jackson
was
not
a
buffoon
but
he
behaved
like
one
which
is
what
matters
and
from
the
winter
garden
she
could
see
people
laughing
at
him
and
at
her
husband
who
got
excited
too
she
hinted
once
or
twice
but
no
notice
was
taken
and
at
last
she
said
rather
sharply
now
you
re
not
to
rickie
i
won
t
have
he
s
a
type
that
suits
me
he
knows
people
i
know
or
would
like
to
have
known
he
was
a
friend
of
tony
failing
s
it
is
so
hard
to
realize
that
a
man
connected
with
one
was
great
uncle
tony
seems
to
have
been
he
loved
poetry
and
music
and
pictures
and
everything
tempted
him
to
live
in
a
kind
of
cultured
paradise
with
the
door
shut
upon
squalor
but
to
have
more
decent
people
in
the
world
he
sacrificed
everything
to
that
he
would
have
smashed
the
whole
if
it
would
help
him
i
really
couldn
t
go
as
far
as
that
i
don
t
think
one
need
go
as
far
pictures
might
have
to
be
smashed
but
not
music
or
poetry
surely
they
help
and
jackson
doesn
t
think
so
well
i
won
t
have
it
and
that
s
she
laughed
for
her
voice
had
a
little
been
that
of
the
professional
scold
you
see
we
must
hang
together
he
s
in
the
reactionary
he
doesn
t
know
it
he
doesn
t
know
that
he
is
in
any
camp
at
his
wife
is
which
comes
to
the
still
it
s
the
holidays
he
and
jackson
had
drifted
apart
in
the
term
chiefly
owing
to
the
affair
of
varden
we
were
to
have
the
holidays
to
ourselves
you
and
following
some
line
of
thought
he
continued
he
cheers
one
up
he
does
believe
in
poetry
smart
sentimental
books
do
seem
absolutely
absurd
to
him
and
gods
and
fairies
far
nearer
to
reality
he
tries
to
express
all
modern
life
in
the
terms
of
greek
mythology
because
the
greeks
looked
very
straight
at
things
and
demeter
or
aphrodite
are
thinner
veils
than
the
survival
of
the
fittest
or
a
marriage
has
been
arranged
and
other
draperies
of
modern
and
do
you
know
what
that
means
it
means
that
poetry
not
prose
lies
at
the
no
i
can
tell
you
what
it
means
his
mouth
fell
she
was
sweeping
away
the
cobwebs
with
a
vengeance
i
hope
you
re
wrong
he
replied
for
those
are
the
lines
on
which
i
ve
been
writing
however
badly
for
the
last
two
but
you
write
stories
not
he
looked
at
his
watch
lessons
again
one
never
has
a
moment
s
poor
rickie
you
shall
have
a
real
holiday
in
the
and
she
called
after
him
to
say
remember
dear
about
jackson
don
t
go
talking
so
much
to
rather
arbitrary
her
tone
had
been
a
little
arbitrary
of
late
but
what
did
it
matter
jackson
was
not
a
friend
and
he
must
risk
the
chance
of
offending
widdrington
after
the
lesson
he
wrote
to
ansell
whom
he
had
not
seen
since
june
asking
him
to
come
down
to
ilfracombe
if
only
for
a
day
on
reading
the
letter
over
its
tone
displeased
him
it
was
quite
pathetic
it
sounded
like
a
cry
from
prison
i
can
t
send
him
such
nonsense
he
thought
and
wrote
again
but
phrase
it
as
he
would
the
letter
always
suggested
that
he
was
unhappy
what
s
wrong
he
wondered
i
could
write
anything
i
wanted
to
him
so
he
scrawled
come
on
a
but
even
this
seemed
too
serious
the
followed
the
letters
and
agnes
found
them
all
in
the
basket
then
she
said
i
ve
been
thinking
oughtn
t
you
to
ask
ansell
over
a
breath
of
sea
air
would
do
the
poor
thing
there
was
no
difficulty
now
he
wrote
at
once
my
dear
stewart
we
both
so
much
wish
you
could
come
but
the
invitation
was
refused
a
little
uneasy
he
wrote
again
using
the
dialect
of
their
past
intimacy
the
effect
of
this
letter
was
not
pathetic
but
jaunty
and
he
felt
a
keen
regret
as
soon
as
it
slipped
into
the
box
it
was
a
relief
to
receive
no
reply
he
brooded
a
good
deal
over
this
painful
yet
intangible
episode
was
the
pain
all
of
his
own
creating
or
had
it
been
produced
by
something
external
and
he
got
the
answer
that
brooding
always
gives
it
was
both
he
was
morbid
and
had
been
so
since
his
visit
to
cadover
quicker
to
register
discomfort
than
joy
but
none
the
less
ansell
was
definitely
brutal
and
agnes
definitely
jealous
brutality
he
could
understand
alien
as
it
was
to
himself
jealousy
equally
alien
was
a
harder
matter
let
husband
and
wife
be
as
sun
and
moon
or
as
moon
and
sun
shall
they
therefore
not
give
greeting
to
the
stars
he
was
willing
to
grant
that
the
love
that
inspired
her
might
be
higher
than
his
own
yet
did
it
not
exclude
them
both
from
much
that
is
gracious
that
dream
of
his
when
he
rode
on
the
wiltshire
expanses
a
curious
dream
the
lark
silent
the
earth
dissolving
and
he
awoke
from
it
into
a
valley
full
of
men
she
was
jealous
in
many
ways
sometimes
in
an
open
humorous
fashion
sometimes
more
subtly
never
content
till
we
had
extended
our
patronage
and
if
possible
our
pity
she
began
to
patronize
and
pity
ansell
and
most
sincerely
trusted
that
he
would
get
his
fellowship
otherwise
what
was
the
poor
fellow
to
do
ridiculous
as
it
may
seem
she
was
even
jealous
of
nature
one
day
her
husband
escaped
from
ilfracombe
to
morthoe
and
came
back
ecstatic
over
its
fangs
of
slate
piercing
an
oily
sea
sounds
like
an
hippopotamus
she
said
peevishly
and
when
they
returned
to
sawston
through
the
virgilian
counties
she
disliked
him
looking
out
of
the
windows
for
all
the
world
as
if
nature
was
some
dangerous
woman
he
resumed
his
duties
with
a
feeling
that
he
had
never
left
them
again
he
confronted
the
assembled
house
this
term
was
again
the
term
school
still
the
world
in
miniature
the
music
of
the
fugue
entered
into
him
more
deeply
and
he
began
to
hum
its
little
phrases
the
same
routine
the
same
diplomacies
the
same
old
sense
of
only
half
knowing
boys
or
men
he
returned
to
it
all
and
all
that
changed
was
the
cloud
of
unreality
which
ever
brooded
a
little
more
densely
than
before
he
spoke
to
his
wife
about
this
he
spoke
to
her
about
everything
and
she
was
alarmed
and
wanted
him
to
see
a
doctor
but
he
explained
that
it
was
nothing
of
any
practical
importance
nothing
that
interfered
with
his
work
or
his
appetite
nothing
more
than
a
feeling
that
the
cow
was
not
really
there
she
laughed
and
how
is
the
cow
today
soon
passed
into
a
domestic
joke
xx
ansell
was
in
his
favourite
haunt
the
of
the
british
museum
in
that
space
he
always
could
find
peace
he
loved
to
see
the
volumes
rising
tier
above
tier
into
the
misty
dome
he
loved
the
chairs
that
glide
so
noiselessly
and
the
radiating
desks
and
the
central
area
where
the
catalogue
shelves
curve
round
the
superintendent
s
throne
there
he
knew
that
his
life
was
not
ignoble
it
was
worth
while
to
grow
old
and
dusty
seeking
for
truth
though
truth
is
unattainable
restating
questions
that
have
been
stated
at
the
beginning
of
the
world
failure
would
await
him
but
not
disillusionment
it
was
worth
while
reading
books
and
writing
a
book
or
two
which
few
would
read
and
no
one
perhaps
endorse
he
was
not
a
hero
and
he
knew
it
his
father
and
sister
by
their
steady
goodness
had
made
this
life
possible
but
all
the
same
it
was
not
the
life
of
a
spoilt
child
in
the
next
chair
to
him
sat
widdrington
engaged
in
his
historical
research
his
desk
was
edged
with
enormous
volumes
and
every
few
moments
an
assistant
brought
him
more
they
rose
like
a
wall
against
ansell
towards
the
end
of
the
morning
a
gap
was
made
and
through
it
they
held
the
following
conversation
i
ve
been
stopping
with
my
cousin
at
m
it
was
quite
exciting
the
air
rang
with
battle
about
of
the
masters
have
lost
their
heads
and
are
trying
to
produce
a
gimcrack
copy
of
eton
last
term
you
know
with
a
great
deal
of
puffing
and
blowing
they
fixed
the
numbers
of
the
school
this
term
they
want
to
create
a
new
they
are
very
but
the
more
they
create
the
less
room
they
leave
for
the
local
mothers
are
frantic
and
so
is
my
queer
cousin
i
never
knew
him
so
excited
over
things
there
was
an
indignation
meeting
at
his
house
he
is
supposed
to
look
after
the
interests
but
no
one
thought
he
would
least
of
all
the
people
who
gave
him
the
post
the
speeches
were
most
eloquent
they
argued
that
the
school
was
founded
for
and
that
it
s
intolerable
to
handicap
them
one
poor
lady
cried
here
s
my
harold
in
the
school
and
my
toddie
coming
on
as
likely
as
not
i
shall
be
told
there
is
no
vacancy
for
him
then
what
am
i
to
do
if
i
go
what
s
to
become
of
harold
and
if
i
stop
what
s
to
become
of
toddie
i
must
say
i
was
touched
family
life
is
more
real
than
national
life
at
least
i
ve
ordered
all
these
books
to
prove
it
is
and
i
fancy
that
the
bust
of
euripides
agreed
with
me
and
was
sorry
for
the
mothers
jackson
will
do
what
he
can
he
didn
t
quite
like
to
state
the
naked
is
that
boardinghouses
pay
he
explained
it
to
me
afterwards
they
are
the
only
future
open
to
a
stupid
master
it
s
easy
enough
to
be
a
beak
when
you
re
young
and
athletic
and
can
offer
the
latest
university
smattering
the
difficulty
is
to
keep
your
place
when
you
get
old
and
stiff
and
younger
smatterers
are
pushing
up
behind
you
crawl
into
a
and
you
re
safe
a
master
s
life
is
frightfully
tragic
jackson
s
fairly
right
himself
because
he
has
got
a
intellect
but
i
met
a
poor
brute
who
was
hired
as
an
athlete
he
has
missed
his
shot
at
a
and
there
s
nothing
in
the
world
for
him
to
do
but
to
trundle
down
the
ansell
yawned
i
saw
rickie
too
once
i
dined
another
yawn
my
cousin
thinks
elliot
one
of
the
most
horrible
women
he
has
ever
seen
he
calls
her
medusa
in
she
s
so
pleasant
too
but
certainly
it
was
a
very
stony
what
kind
of
stoniness
no
one
stopped
talking
for
a
that
s
the
real
kind
said
ansell
moodily
the
only
well
i
he
continued
am
inclined
to
compare
her
to
an
electric
light
click
she
s
on
click
she
s
off
no
waste
no
i
wish
she
d
she
ll
never
fuse
unless
anything
was
to
happen
at
the
what
do
you
mean
by
the
main
said
ansell
who
always
pursued
a
metaphor
relentlessly
widdrington
did
not
know
what
he
meant
and
suggested
that
ansell
should
visit
sawston
to
see
whether
one
could
know
it
is
no
good
me
going
i
should
not
find
elliot
she
has
no
real
rickie
i
very
much
doubt
it
i
had
two
letters
from
ilfracombe
last
april
and
i
very
much
doubt
that
the
man
who
wrote
them
can
bending
downwards
he
began
to
adorn
the
manuscript
of
his
dissertation
with
a
square
and
inside
that
a
circle
and
inside
that
another
square
it
was
his
second
dissertation
the
first
had
failed
i
think
he
exists
he
is
so
ansell
nodded
how
did
you
know
he
was
unhappy
because
he
was
always
after
a
pause
he
added
what
clever
young
men
we
are
aren
t
we
i
expect
we
shall
get
asked
in
marriage
soon
i
say
widdrington
shall
we
accept
of
course
it
is
not
young
manly
to
say
i
meant
shall
we
ever
do
a
more
tremendous
thing
fuse
no
said
widdrington
promptly
we
shall
never
do
that
in
all
our
he
added
i
think
you
might
go
down
to
sawston
i
have
already
refused
or
ignored
three
so
i
what
s
the
good
of
it
said
ansell
through
his
teeth
i
will
not
put
up
with
little
things
i
would
rather
be
rude
than
to
listen
to
twaddle
from
a
man
i
ve
known
you
might
go
down
to
sawston
just
for
a
night
to
see
i
saw
him
last
month
at
least
so
tilliard
informs
me
he
says
that
we
all
three
lunched
together
that
rickie
paid
and
that
the
conversation
was
most
well
i
contend
that
he
does
exist
and
that
if
you
go
oh
i
can
t
be
clever
any
longer
you
really
must
go
man
i
m
certain
he
s
miserable
and
lonely
dunwood
house
reeks
of
commerce
and
snobbery
and
all
the
things
he
hated
most
he
doesn
t
do
anything
he
doesn
t
make
any
friends
he
is
so
odd
too
in
this
row
that
has
just
started
he
s
gone
for
my
cousin
would
you
believe
it
quite
spitefully
it
made
quite
a
difficulty
when
i
wanted
to
dine
it
isn
t
like
him
either
the
sentiments
or
the
behaviour
i
m
sure
he
s
not
himself
pembroke
used
to
look
after
the
and
so
he
can
t
very
well
take
the
lead
against
them
and
perhaps
rickie
s
doing
his
dirty
work
and
has
overdone
it
as
decent
people
generally
do
he
s
even
altering
to
talk
to
yet
he
s
not
been
married
a
year
pembroke
and
that
wife
simply
run
him
i
don
t
see
why
they
should
and
no
more
do
you
and
that
s
why
i
want
you
to
go
to
sawston
if
only
for
one
ansell
shook
his
head
and
looked
up
at
the
dome
as
other
men
look
at
the
sky
in
it
the
great
arc
lamps
sputtered
and
flared
for
the
month
was
again
november
then
he
lowered
his
eyes
from
the
cold
violet
radiance
to
the
books
no
widdrington
no
we
don
t
go
to
see
people
because
they
are
happy
or
unhappy
we
go
when
we
can
talk
to
them
i
can
not
talk
to
rickie
therefore
i
will
not
waste
my
time
at
i
think
you
re
right
said
widdrington
softly
but
we
are
bloodless
brutes
i
wonder
we
were
different
people
something
might
be
done
to
save
him
that
is
the
curse
of
being
a
little
intellectual
you
and
our
sort
have
always
seen
too
clearly
we
stand
aside
and
meanwhile
he
turns
into
stone
two
philosophic
youths
repining
in
the
british
museum
what
have
we
done
what
shall
we
ever
do
just
drift
and
criticize
while
people
who
know
what
they
want
snatch
it
away
from
us
and
perhaps
you
are
that
sort
i
m
not
when
the
moment
comes
i
shall
hit
out
like
any
ploughboy
don
t
believe
those
lies
about
intellectual
people
they
re
only
written
to
soothe
the
majority
do
you
suppose
with
the
world
as
it
is
that
it
s
an
easy
matter
to
keep
quiet
do
you
suppose
that
i
didn
t
want
to
rescue
him
from
that
ghastly
woman
action
nothing
s
easier
than
action
as
fools
testify
but
i
want
to
act
the
superintendent
is
looking
at
us
i
must
get
back
to
my
you
think
this
all
nonsense
said
ansell
detaining
him
please
remember
that
if
i
do
act
you
are
bound
to
help
widdrington
looked
a
little
grave
he
was
no
anarchist
a
few
plaintive
cries
against
elliot
were
all
that
he
prepared
to
emit
there
s
no
mystery
continued
ansell
i
haven
t
the
shadow
of
a
plan
in
my
head
i
know
not
only
rickie
but
the
whole
of
his
history
you
remember
the
day
near
madingley
nothing
in
either
helps
me
i
m
just
but
what
for
for
the
spirit
of
widdrington
was
surprised
it
was
a
phrase
unknown
to
their
philosophy
they
had
trespassed
into
poetry
you
can
t
fight
medusa
with
anything
else
if
you
ask
me
what
the
spirit
of
life
is
or
to
what
it
is
attached
i
can
t
tell
you
i
only
tell
you
watch
for
it
myself
i
ve
found
it
in
books
some
people
find
it
out
of
doors
or
in
each
other
never
mind
it
s
the
same
spirit
and
i
trust
myself
to
know
it
anywhere
and
to
use
it
but
at
this
point
the
superintendent
sent
a
message
widdrington
then
suggested
a
stroll
in
the
galleries
it
was
foggy
they
needed
fresh
air
he
loved
and
admired
his
friend
but
today
he
could
not
grasp
him
the
world
as
ansell
saw
it
seemed
such
a
fantastic
place
governed
by
laws
what
more
could
one
do
than
to
see
rickie
as
often
as
possible
to
invite
his
confidence
to
offer
him
spiritual
support
and
elliot
what
power
could
fuse
a
respectable
woman
ansell
consented
to
the
stroll
but
as
usual
only
breathed
depression
the
comfort
of
books
deserted
him
among
those
marble
goddesses
and
gods
the
eye
of
an
artist
finds
pleasure
in
texture
and
poise
but
he
could
only
think
of
the
vanished
incense
and
deserted
temples
beside
an
unfurrowed
sea
let
us
go
he
said
i
do
not
like
carved
you
are
too
particular
said
widdrington
you
are
always
expecting
to
meet
living
people
one
never
does
i
am
content
with
the
parthenon
and
he
moved
along
a
few
yards
of
it
while
ansell
followed
conscious
only
of
its
pathos
there
s
tilliard
he
observed
shall
we
kill
him
please
said
widdrington
and
as
he
spoke
tilliard
joined
them
he
brought
them
news
that
morning
he
had
heard
from
rickie
elliot
was
expecting
a
child
a
child
said
ansell
suddenly
bewildered
oh
i
forgot
interposed
widdrington
my
cousin
did
tell
you
forgot
well
after
all
i
forgot
that
it
might
be
we
are
indeed
young
he
leant
against
the
pedestal
of
ilissus
and
remembered
their
talk
about
the
spirit
of
life
in
his
ignorance
of
what
a
child
means
he
wondered
whether
the
opportunity
he
sought
lay
here
i
am
very
glad
said
tilliard
not
without
intention
a
child
will
draw
them
even
closer
together
i
like
to
see
young
people
wrapped
up
in
their
i
suppose
i
must
be
getting
back
to
my
dissertation
said
ansell
he
left
the
parthenon
to
pass
by
the
monuments
of
our
more
reticent
beliefs
the
temple
of
the
ephesian
artemis
the
statue
of
the
cnidian
demeter
honest
he
knew
that
here
were
powers
he
could
not
cope
with
nor
as
yet
understand
xxi
the
mists
that
had
gathered
round
rickie
seemed
to
be
breaking
he
had
found
light
neither
in
work
for
which
he
was
unfitted
nor
in
a
woman
who
had
ceased
to
respect
him
and
whom
he
was
ceasing
to
love
though
he
called
himself
fickle
and
took
all
the
blame
of
their
marriage
on
his
own
shoulders
there
remained
in
agnes
certain
terrible
faults
of
heart
and
head
and
no
would
diminish
them
the
glamour
of
wedlock
had
faded
indeed
he
saw
now
that
it
had
faded
even
before
wedlock
and
that
during
the
final
months
he
had
shut
his
eyes
and
pretended
it
was
still
there
but
now
the
mists
were
breaking
that
november
the
supreme
event
approached
he
saw
it
with
nature
s
eyes
it
dawned
on
him
as
on
ansell
that
personal
love
and
marriage
only
cover
one
side
of
the
shield
and
that
on
the
other
is
graven
the
epic
of
birth
in
the
midst
of
lessons
he
would
grow
dreamy
as
one
who
spies
a
new
symbol
for
the
universe
a
fresh
circle
within
the
square
within
the
square
shall
be
a
circle
within
the
circle
another
square
until
the
visual
eye
is
baffled
here
is
meaning
of
a
kind
his
mother
had
forgotten
herself
in
him
he
would
forget
himself
in
his
son
he
was
at
his
duties
when
the
news
arrived
taking
preparation
boys
are
marvellous
creatures
perhaps
they
will
sink
below
the
brutes
perhaps
they
will
attain
to
a
woman
s
tenderness
though
they
despised
rickie
and
had
suffered
under
agnes
s
meanness
their
one
thought
this
term
was
to
be
gentle
and
to
give
no
trouble
rickie
one
moment
his
face
grew
ashen
he
followed
herbert
into
the
passage
closing
the
door
of
the
preparation
room
behind
him
oh
is
she
safe
he
whispered
yes
yes
said
herbert
but
there
sounded
in
his
answer
a
sombre
hostile
note
our
boy
girl
a
girl
dear
rickie
a
little
daughter
she
she
is
in
many
ways
a
healthy
child
she
will
live
oh
a
flash
of
horror
passed
over
his
face
he
hurried
into
the
preparation
room
lifted
the
lid
of
his
desk
glanced
mechanically
at
the
boys
and
came
out
again
lewin
appeared
through
the
door
that
led
into
their
own
part
of
the
house
both
going
on
well
she
cried
but
her
voice
also
was
grave
exasperated
what
is
it
he
gasped
it
s
something
you
daren
t
tell
only
this
stuttered
herbert
you
mustn
t
mind
when
you
see
she
s
lewin
disappeared
lame
but
not
as
lame
as
i
am
oh
my
dear
boy
worse
don
t
oh
be
a
man
in
this
come
away
from
the
preparation
room
remember
she
ll
live
in
many
ways
healthy
only
just
this
one
the
horror
of
that
week
never
passed
away
from
him
to
the
end
of
his
life
he
remembered
the
excuses
the
consolations
that
the
child
would
live
suffered
very
little
if
at
all
would
walk
with
crutches
would
certainly
live
god
was
more
merciful
a
window
was
opened
too
wide
on
a
draughty
day
after
a
short
painless
illness
his
daughter
died
but
the
lesson
he
had
learnt
so
glibly
at
cambridge
should
be
heeded
now
no
child
should
ever
be
born
to
him
again
xxii
that
same
term
there
took
place
at
dunwood
house
another
event
with
their
private
tragedy
it
seemed
to
have
no
connection
but
in
time
rickie
perceived
it
as
a
bitter
comment
its
developments
were
unforeseen
and
lasting
it
was
perhaps
the
most
terrible
thing
he
had
to
bear
varden
had
now
been
a
boarder
for
ten
months
his
health
had
broken
in
the
previous
term
partly
it
is
to
be
feared
as
the
result
of
the
indifferent
food
and
during
the
summer
holidays
he
was
attacked
by
a
series
of
agonizing
earaches
his
mother
a
feeble
person
wished
to
keep
him
at
home
but
herbert
dissuaded
her
soon
after
the
death
of
the
child
there
arose
at
dunwood
house
one
of
those
waves
of
hostility
of
which
no
boy
knows
the
origin
nor
any
master
can
calculate
the
course
varden
had
never
been
popular
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
be
but
he
had
never
been
seriously
bullied
hitherto
one
evening
nearly
the
whole
house
set
on
him
the
prefects
absented
themselves
the
bigger
boys
stood
round
and
the
lesser
boys
to
whom
power
was
delegated
flung
him
down
and
rubbed
his
face
under
the
desks
and
wrenched
at
his
ears
the
noise
penetrated
the
baize
doors
and
herbert
swept
through
and
punished
the
whole
house
including
varden
whom
it
would
not
do
to
leave
out
the
poor
man
was
horrified
he
approved
of
a
little
healthy
roughness
but
this
was
pure
brutalization
what
had
come
over
his
boys
were
they
not
gentlemen
s
sons
he
would
not
admit
that
if
you
herd
together
human
beings
before
they
can
understand
each
other
the
great
god
pan
is
angry
and
will
in
the
end
evade
your
regulations
and
drive
them
mad
that
night
the
victim
was
screaming
with
pain
and
the
doctor
next
day
spoke
of
an
operation
the
suspense
lasted
a
whole
week
comment
was
made
in
the
local
papers
and
the
reputation
not
only
of
the
house
but
of
the
school
was
imperilled
if
only
i
had
known
repeated
herbert
if
only
i
had
known
i
would
have
arranged
it
all
differently
he
should
have
had
a
the
boy
did
not
die
but
he
left
sawston
never
to
return
the
day
before
his
departure
rickie
sat
with
him
some
time
and
tried
to
talk
in
a
way
that
was
not
pedantic
in
his
own
sorrow
which
he
could
share
with
no
one
least
of
all
with
his
wife
he
was
still
alive
to
the
sorrows
of
others
he
still
fought
against
apathy
though
he
was
losing
the
battle
don
t
lose
heart
he
told
him
the
world
isn
t
all
going
to
be
like
this
there
are
temptations
and
trials
of
course
but
nothing
at
all
of
the
kind
you
have
had
but
school
is
the
world
in
miniature
is
it
not
sir
asked
the
boy
hoping
to
please
one
master
by
echoing
what
had
been
told
him
by
another
he
was
always
on
the
lookout
for
sympathy
it
was
one
of
the
things
that
had
contributed
to
his
downfall
i
never
noticed
that
myself
i
was
unhappy
at
school
and
in
the
world
people
can
be
very
varden
sighed
and
rolled
about
his
eyes
are
the
fellows
sorry
for
what
they
did
to
me
he
asked
in
an
affected
voice
i
am
sure
i
forgive
them
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
we
ought
to
forgive
our
enemies
oughtn
t
we
sir
but
they
aren
t
your
enemies
if
you
meet
in
five
years
time
you
may
find
each
other
splendid
the
boy
would
not
admit
this
he
had
been
reading
some
revivalistic
literature
we
ought
to
forgive
our
enemies
he
repeated
and
however
wicked
they
are
we
ought
not
to
wish
them
evil
when
i
was
ill
and
death
seemed
nearest
i
had
many
kind
letters
on
this
rickie
knew
about
these
many
kind
varden
had
induced
the
silly
nurse
to
write
to
people
people
of
all
sorts
people
that
he
scarcely
knew
or
did
not
know
at
all
detailing
his
misfortune
and
asking
for
spiritual
aid
and
sympathy
i
am
sorry
for
them
he
pursued
i
would
not
like
to
be
like
rickie
sighed
he
saw
that
a
year
at
dunwood
house
had
produced
a
sanctimonious
prig
don
t
think
about
them
varden
think
about
anything
beautiful
say
music
you
like
music
be
happy
it
s
your
duty
you
can
t
be
good
until
you
ve
had
a
little
happiness
then
perhaps
you
will
think
less
about
forgiving
people
and
more
about
loving
i
love
them
already
and
rickie
in
desperation
asked
if
he
might
look
at
the
many
kind
letters
permission
was
gladly
given
a
neat
bundle
was
produced
and
for
about
twenty
minutes
the
master
perused
it
while
the
invalid
kept
watch
on
his
face
rooks
cawed
out
in
the
and
close
under
the
window
there
was
the
sound
of
delightful
laughter
a
boy
is
no
devil
whatever
boys
may
be
the
letters
were
chilly
productions
somewhat
clerical
in
tone
by
whomsoever
written
varden
because
he
was
ill
at
the
time
had
been
taken
seriously
the
writers
declared
that
his
illness
was
fulfilling
some
mysterious
purpose
suffering
engendered
spiritual
growth
he
was
showing
signs
of
this
already
they
consented
to
pray
for
him
some
majestically
others
shyly
but
they
all
consented
with
one
exception
who
worded
his
refusal
as
follows
dear
varden
i
ought
to
say
that
i
never
remember
seeing
you
i
am
sorry
that
you
are
ill
and
hope
you
are
wrong
about
it
why
did
you
not
write
before
for
i
could
have
helped
you
then
when
they
pulled
your
ear
you
ought
to
have
gone
like
this
here
was
a
rough
sketch
i
could
not
undertake
praying
but
would
think
of
you
instead
if
that
would
do
i
am
in
april
built
rather
heavy
ordinary
broad
face
with
eyes
etc
i
write
all
this
because
you
have
mixed
me
with
some
one
else
for
i
am
not
married
and
do
not
want
to
be
i
can
not
think
of
you
always
but
will
promise
a
quarter
of
an
hour
daily
say
and
might
come
to
see
you
when
you
are
better
that
is
if
you
are
a
kid
and
you
read
like
one
i
have
been
yours
sincerely
stephen
wonham
xxiii
riekie
went
straight
from
varden
to
his
wife
who
lay
on
the
sofa
in
her
bedroom
there
was
now
a
wide
gulf
between
them
she
like
the
world
she
had
created
for
him
was
unreal
agnes
darling
he
began
stroking
her
hand
such
an
awkward
little
thing
has
what
is
it
dear
just
wait
till
i
ve
added
up
this
she
had
got
over
the
tragedy
she
got
over
everything
when
she
was
at
leisure
he
told
her
hitherto
they
had
seldom
mentioned
stephen
he
was
classed
among
the
unprofitable
dead
she
was
more
sympathetic
than
he
expected
dear
rickie
she
murmured
with
averted
eyes
how
tiresome
for
i
wish
that
varden
had
stopped
with
well
he
leaves
us
for
good
yes
yes
and
i
made
him
answer
the
letter
and
apologize
they
had
never
met
it
was
some
confusion
with
a
man
in
the
church
army
living
at
a
place
called
codford
i
asked
the
nurse
it
is
all
there
the
matter
i
suppose
so
if
matters
ever
if
by
the
person
does
call
i
will
just
see
him
and
say
that
the
boy
has
you
or
i
have
got
over
all
nonsense
by
this
time
he
s
absolutely
nothing
to
me
he
took
up
the
tradesman
s
book
and
played
with
it
idly
on
its
crimson
cover
was
stamped
a
grotesque
sheep
how
stale
and
stupid
their
life
had
become
don
t
talk
like
that
though
she
said
uneasily
think
how
disastrous
it
would
be
if
you
made
a
slip
in
speaking
to
would
it
it
would
have
been
disastrous
once
but
i
expect
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
aunt
emily
has
made
the
slip
his
wife
was
displeased
you
need
not
talk
in
that
cynical
way
i
credit
aunt
emily
with
better
feeling
when
i
was
there
she
did
mention
the
matter
but
only
once
she
and
i
and
all
who
have
any
sense
of
decency
know
better
than
to
make
slips
or
to
think
of
making
agnes
kept
up
what
she
called
the
family
she
had
been
once
alone
to
cadover
and
also
corresponded
with
mrs
failing
she
had
never
told
rickie
anything
about
her
visit
nor
had
he
ever
asked
her
but
from
this
moment
the
whole
subject
was
reopened
most
certainly
he
knows
nothing
she
continued
why
he
does
not
even
realize
that
varden
lives
in
our
house
we
are
perfectly
safe
unless
aunt
emily
were
to
die
perhaps
then
but
we
are
perfectly
safe
for
the
when
she
did
mention
the
matter
what
did
she
say
we
had
a
long
talk
said
agnes
quietly
she
told
me
nothing
new
nothing
new
about
the
past
i
mean
but
we
had
a
long
talk
about
the
present
i
think
and
her
voice
grew
displeased
again
that
you
have
been
both
wrong
and
foolish
in
refusing
to
make
up
your
quarrel
with
aunt
wrong
and
wise
i
should
it
isn
t
to
be
expected
that
she
so
much
older
and
so
sensitive
can
make
the
first
step
but
i
know
she
d
he
glad
to
see
as
far
as
i
can
remember
that
final
scene
in
the
garden
i
accused
her
of
forgetting
what
other
people
were
she
ll
never
pardon
me
for
saying
agnes
was
silent
to
her
the
phrase
was
meaningless
yet
rickie
was
correct
mrs
failing
had
resented
it
more
than
anything
at
all
events
she
suggested
you
might
go
and
see
no
dear
thank
you
she
is
after
all
she
was
going
to
say
your
father
s
sister
but
the
expression
was
scarcely
a
happy
one
and
she
turned
it
into
she
is
after
all
growing
old
and
so
are
we
all
he
cried
with
a
lapse
of
tone
that
was
now
characteristic
in
him
she
oughtn
t
to
be
so
isolated
from
her
proper
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
still
playing
with
the
book
he
remarked
you
forget
she
s
got
her
favourite
a
bright
red
flush
spread
over
her
cheeks
what
is
the
matter
with
you
this
afternoon
she
asked
i
should
think
you
d
better
go
for
a
before
i
go
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
with
he
also
flushed
why
do
you
want
me
to
make
it
up
with
my
aunt
because
it
s
right
and
so
or
because
she
is
old
i
don
t
understand
she
retorted
but
her
eyes
dropped
his
sudden
suspicion
was
true
she
was
legacy
hunting
agnes
dear
agnes
he
began
with
passing
tenderness
how
can
you
think
of
such
things
you
behave
like
a
poor
person
we
don
t
want
any
money
from
aunt
emily
or
from
any
one
else
it
isn
t
virtue
that
makes
me
say
it
we
are
not
tempted
in
that
way
we
have
as
much
as
we
want
for
the
present
she
answered
still
looking
aside
there
isn
t
any
future
he
cried
in
a
gust
of
despair
rickie
what
do
you
mean
what
did
he
mean
he
meant
that
the
relations
between
them
were
fixed
that
there
would
never
be
an
influx
of
interest
nor
even
of
passion
to
the
end
of
life
they
would
go
on
beating
time
and
this
was
enough
for
her
she
was
content
with
the
daily
round
the
common
task
performed
indifferently
but
he
had
dreamt
of
another
helpmate
and
of
other
things
we
don
t
want
money
why
we
don
t
even
spend
any
on
travelling
i
ve
invested
all
my
salary
and
more
as
far
as
human
foresight
goes
we
shall
never
want
and
his
thoughts
went
out
to
the
tiny
grave
you
spoke
of
right
and
proper
but
the
right
and
proper
thing
for
my
aunt
to
do
is
to
leave
every
penny
she
s
got
to
her
lip
quivered
and
for
one
moment
he
thought
that
she
was
going
to
cry
what
am
i
to
do
with
you
she
said
you
talk
like
a
person
in
i
ll
put
it
in
prose
he
s
lived
with
her
for
twenty
years
and
he
ought
to
be
paid
for
poor
agnes
indeed
what
was
she
to
do
the
first
moment
she
set
foot
in
cadover
she
had
thought
oh
here
is
money
we
must
try
and
get
being
a
lady
she
never
mentioned
the
thought
to
her
husband
but
she
concluded
that
it
would
occur
to
him
too
and
now
though
it
had
occurred
to
him
at
last
he
would
not
even
write
his
aunt
a
little
note
he
was
to
try
her
yet
further
while
they
argued
this
point
he
flashed
out
with
i
ought
to
have
told
him
that
day
when
he
called
up
to
our
room
there
s
where
i
went
wrong
rickie
in
those
days
i
was
sentimental
i
minded
for
two
pins
i
d
write
to
him
this
afternoon
why
shouldn
t
he
know
he
s
my
brother
what
s
all
this
ridiculous
mystery
she
became
incoherent
but
why
not
a
reason
why
he
shouldn
t
a
reason
why
he
should
know
she
retorted
i
never
heard
such
rubbish
give
me
a
reason
why
he
should
because
the
lie
we
acted
has
ruined
our
she
looked
in
bewilderment
at
the
room
it
s
been
like
a
poison
we
won
t
acknowledge
how
many
times
have
you
thought
of
my
brother
i
ve
thought
of
him
every
day
not
in
love
don
t
misunderstand
only
as
a
medicine
i
shirked
down
in
what
they
call
the
subconscious
self
he
has
been
hurting
his
voice
broke
oh
my
darling
we
acted
a
lie
then
and
this
letter
reminds
us
of
it
and
gives
us
one
more
chance
i
have
to
say
we
lied
i
should
be
lying
again
if
i
took
quite
all
the
blame
let
us
ask
god
s
forgiveness
together
then
let
us
write
as
coldly
as
you
please
to
stephen
and
tell
him
he
is
my
father
s
her
reply
need
not
be
quoted
it
was
the
last
time
he
attempted
intimacy
and
the
remainder
of
their
conversation
though
long
and
stormy
is
also
best
forgotten
thus
the
first
effect
of
varden
s
letter
was
to
make
them
quarrel
they
had
not
openly
disagreed
before
in
the
evening
he
kissed
her
and
said
how
absurd
i
was
to
get
angry
about
things
that
happened
last
year
i
will
certainly
not
write
to
the
she
returned
the
kiss
but
he
knew
that
they
had
destroyed
the
habit
of
reverence
and
would
quarrel
again
on
his
rounds
he
looked
in
at
varden
and
asked
nonchalantly
for
the
letter
he
carried
it
off
to
his
room
it
was
unwise
of
him
for
his
nerves
were
already
unstrung
and
the
man
he
had
tried
to
bury
was
stirring
ominously
in
the
silence
he
examined
the
handwriting
till
he
felt
that
a
living
creature
was
with
him
whereas
he
because
his
child
had
died
was
dead
he
perceived
more
clearly
the
cruelty
of
nature
to
whom
our
refinement
and
piety
are
but
as
bubbles
hurrying
downwards
on
the
turbid
waters
they
break
and
the
stream
continues
his
father
as
a
final
insult
had
brought
into
the
world
a
man
unlike
all
the
rest
of
them
a
man
dowered
with
coarse
kindliness
and
rustic
strength
a
kind
of
cynical
ploughboy
against
whom
their
own
misery
and
weakness
might
stand
more
vividly
relieved
born
an
elliot
born
a
so
the
vile
phrase
ran
but
here
was
an
elliot
whose
badness
was
not
even
gentlemanly
for
that
stephen
was
bad
inherently
he
never
doubted
for
a
moment
and
he
would
have
children
he
not
rickie
would
contribute
to
the
stream
he
through
his
remote
posterity
might
mingled
with
the
unknown
sea
thus
musing
he
lay
down
to
sleep
feeling
diseased
in
body
and
soul
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
night
was
the
most
terrible
he
had
ever
known
he
revisited
cambridge
and
his
name
was
a
grey
ghost
over
the
door
then
there
recurred
the
voice
of
a
gentle
shadowy
woman
aberdeen
it
doesn
t
seem
hardly
those
had
been
her
words
her
only
complaint
against
the
mysteries
of
change
and
death
she
bowed
her
head
and
laboured
to
make
her
gentlemen
comfortable
she
was
labouring
still
as
he
lay
in
bed
he
asked
god
to
grant
him
her
wisdom
that
he
might
keep
sorrow
within
due
bounds
that
he
might
abstain
from
extreme
hatred
and
envy
of
stephen
it
was
seldom
that
he
prayed
so
definitely
or
ventured
to
obtrude
his
private
wishes
religion
was
to
him
a
service
a
mystic
communion
with
good
not
a
means
of
getting
what
he
wanted
on
the
earth
but
tonight
through
suffering
he
was
humbled
and
became
like
aberdeen
hour
after
hour
he
awaited
sleep
and
tried
to
endure
the
faces
that
frothed
in
the
gloom
his
aunt
s
his
father
s
and
worst
of
all
the
triumphant
face
of
his
brother
once
he
struck
at
it
and
awoke
having
hurt
his
hand
on
the
wall
then
he
prayed
hysterically
for
pardon
and
rest
yet
again
did
he
awake
and
from
a
more
mysterious
dream
he
heard
his
mother
crying
she
was
crying
quite
distinctly
in
the
darkened
room
he
whispered
never
mind
my
darling
never
mind
and
a
voice
echoed
never
mind
come
away
let
them
die
out
let
them
die
he
lit
a
candle
and
the
room
was
empty
then
hurrying
to
the
window
he
saw
above
mean
houses
the
frosty
glories
of
orion
henceforward
he
deteriorates
let
those
who
censure
him
suggest
what
he
should
do
he
has
lost
the
work
that
he
loved
his
friends
and
his
child
he
remained
conscientious
and
decent
but
the
spiritual
part
of
him
proceeded
towards
ruin
xxiv
the
coming
months
though
full
of
degradation
and
anxiety
were
to
bring
him
nothing
so
terrible
as
that
night
it
was
the
crisis
of
this
agony
he
was
an
outcast
and
a
failure
but
he
was
not
again
forced
to
contemplate
these
facts
so
clearly
varden
left
in
the
morning
carrying
the
fatal
letter
with
him
the
whole
house
was
relieved
the
good
angel
was
with
the
boys
again
or
else
as
herbert
preferred
to
think
they
had
learnt
a
lesson
and
were
more
humane
in
consequence
at
all
events
the
disastrous
term
concluded
quietly
in
the
christmas
holidays
the
two
masters
made
an
abortive
attempt
to
visit
italy
and
at
easter
there
was
talk
of
a
cruise
in
the
aegean
herbert
actually
went
and
enjoyed
athens
and
delphi
the
elliots
paid
a
few
visits
together
in
england
they
returned
to
sawston
about
ten
days
before
school
opened
to
find
that
widdrington
was
again
stopping
with
the
jacksons
intercourse
was
painful
for
the
two
families
were
scarcely
on
speaking
terms
nor
did
the
triumphant
scaffoldings
of
the
new
make
things
easier
the
party
of
progress
had
carried
the
day
widdrington
was
by
nature
touchy
but
on
this
occasion
he
refused
to
take
offence
and
often
dropped
in
to
see
them
his
manner
was
friendly
but
critical
they
agreed
he
was
a
nuisance
then
agnes
left
very
abruptly
to
see
mrs
failing
and
while
she
was
away
rickie
had
a
little
stealthy
intercourse
her
absence
convenient
as
it
was
puzzled
him
silt
half
goose
half
had
recently
paid
a
flying
visit
to
cadover
and
thence
had
flown
without
an
invitation
to
sawston
generally
she
was
not
a
welcome
guest
on
this
occasion
agnes
had
welcomed
her
and
so
rickie
thought
had
made
her
promise
not
to
tell
him
something
that
she
knew
the
ladies
had
talked
mysteriously
mr
silt
would
be
one
with
you
there
said
silt
could
there
be
any
connection
between
the
two
visits
agnes
s
letters
told
him
nothing
they
never
did
she
was
too
clumsy
or
too
cautious
to
express
herself
on
paper
a
drive
to
stonehenge
an
anthem
in
the
cathedral
aunt
emily
s
love
and
when
he
met
her
at
waterloo
he
learnt
nothing
if
there
was
anything
to
learn
from
her
face
how
did
you
enjoy
yourself
were
you
and
she
alone
sometimes
sometimes
other
will
uncle
tony
s
essays
be
published
here
she
was
more
communicative
the
book
was
at
last
in
proof
aunt
emily
had
written
a
charming
introduction
but
she
was
so
idle
she
never
finished
things
off
they
got
into
an
omnibus
for
the
army
and
navy
stores
she
wanted
to
do
some
shopping
before
going
down
to
sawston
did
you
read
any
of
the
essays
every
one
delightful
couldn
t
put
them
down
now
and
then
he
spoilt
them
by
statistics
but
you
should
read
his
descriptions
of
nature
he
agrees
with
you
says
the
hills
and
trees
are
alive
aunt
emily
called
you
his
spiritual
heir
which
i
thought
nice
of
her
we
both
so
lamented
that
you
have
stopped
she
quoted
fragments
of
the
essays
as
they
went
up
in
the
stores
lift
what
else
did
you
talk
about
i
ve
told
you
all
my
news
now
for
yours
let
s
have
tea
they
sat
down
in
the
corridor
amid
ladies
in
every
stage
of
fatigue
haggard
ladies
scarlet
ladies
ladies
with
parcels
that
twisted
from
every
finger
like
joints
of
meat
gentlemen
were
scarcer
but
all
were
of
the
type
to
which
rickie
himself
now
belonged
i
haven
t
done
anything
he
said
feebly
ate
read
been
rude
to
tradespeople
talked
to
widdrington
herbert
arrived
this
morning
he
has
brought
a
most
beautiful
photograph
of
the
mr
widdrington
what
did
you
talk
about
she
might
have
heard
every
word
it
was
only
the
feeling
of
pleasure
that
he
wished
to
conceal
even
when
we
love
people
we
desire
to
keep
some
corner
secret
from
them
however
small
it
is
a
human
right
it
is
personality
she
began
to
him
but
they
were
interrupted
a
young
lady
at
an
adjacent
table
suddenly
rose
and
cried
yes
it
is
you
i
thought
so
from
your
it
was
maud
ansell
oh
do
come
and
join
us
he
cried
let
me
introduce
my
maud
bowed
quite
stiffly
but
agnes
taking
it
for
was
not
offended
then
i
will
come
she
continued
in
shrill
pleasant
tones
adroitly
poising
her
tea
things
on
either
hand
and
transferring
them
to
the
elliots
table
why
haven
t
you
ever
come
to
us
pray
i
think
you
didn
t
ask
me
you
weren
t
to
be
she
sprawled
forward
with
a
wagging
finger
but
her
eyes
had
the
honesty
of
her
brother
s
don
t
you
remember
the
day
you
left
us
father
said
now
elliot
or
did
he
call
you
elliot
how
one
does
forget
anyhow
father
said
you
weren
t
to
wait
for
an
invitation
and
you
said
no
i
won
ours
is
a
house
she
turned
somewhat
haughtily
to
agnes
and
the
second
spare
room
on
account
of
a
harp
that
hangs
on
the
wall
is
always
reserved
for
stewart
s
how
is
ansell
your
brother
maud
s
face
fell
hadn
t
you
heard
she
said
in
tones
he
hasn
t
got
his
fellowship
it
s
the
second
time
he
s
failed
that
means
he
will
never
get
one
he
will
never
be
a
don
nor
live
in
cambridge
and
that
as
we
had
oh
poor
poor
fellow
said
elliot
with
a
remorse
that
was
sincere
though
her
congratulations
would
not
have
been
i
am
so
very
but
maud
turned
to
rickie
mr
elliot
you
might
know
tell
me
what
is
wrong
with
stewart
s
philosophy
what
ought
he
to
put
in
or
to
alter
so
as
to
succeed
agnes
who
knew
better
than
this
smiled
i
don
t
know
said
rickie
sadly
they
were
none
of
them
so
clever
after
all
hegel
she
continued
vindictively
they
say
he
s
read
too
much
hegel
but
they
never
tell
him
what
to
read
instead
their
own
stuffy
books
i
suppose
look
here
no
that
s
the
after
a
little
groping
she
produced
a
copy
of
mind
and
handed
it
round
as
if
it
was
a
geological
specimen
inside
that
there
s
a
paragraph
written
about
something
stewart
s
written
about
before
and
there
it
says
he
s
read
too
much
hegel
and
it
seems
now
that
that
s
been
the
trouble
all
her
voice
trembled
i
call
it
most
unfair
and
the
fellowship
s
gone
to
a
man
who
has
counted
the
petals
on
an
rickie
had
no
inclination
to
smile
i
wish
stewart
had
tried
oxford
i
don
t
wish
it
you
say
that
she
continued
hotly
and
then
you
never
come
to
see
him
though
you
knew
you
were
not
to
wait
for
an
if
it
comes
to
that
miss
ansell
retorted
rickie
in
the
laughing
tones
that
one
adopts
on
such
occasions
stewart
won
t
come
to
me
though
he
has
had
an
yes
chimed
in
agnes
we
ask
ansell
again
and
again
and
he
will
have
none
of
maud
looked
at
her
with
a
flashing
eye
my
brother
is
a
very
peculiar
person
and
we
ladies
can
t
understand
him
but
i
know
one
thing
and
that
s
that
he
has
a
reason
all
round
for
what
he
does
look
here
i
must
be
getting
on
waiter
bill
please
separately
of
course
call
the
army
and
navy
cheap
i
know
better
how
does
the
drapery
department
compare
said
agnes
sweetly
the
girl
gave
a
sharp
choking
sound
gathered
up
her
parcels
and
left
them
rickie
was
too
much
disgusted
with
his
wife
to
speak
appalling
person
she
gasped
it
was
naughty
of
me
but
i
couldn
t
help
it
what
a
dreadful
fate
for
a
clever
man
to
fail
in
life
completely
and
then
to
be
thrown
back
on
a
family
like
that
maud
is
a
snob
and
a
philistine
but
in
her
case
something
she
glanced
at
him
but
proceeded
in
her
suavest
tones
do
let
us
make
one
great
united
attempt
to
get
ansell
to
what
a
changeable
friend
you
are
when
we
were
engaged
you
were
always
talking
about
would
you
finish
your
tea
and
then
we
will
buy
the
linoleum
for
the
but
she
returned
to
the
subject
again
not
only
on
that
day
but
throughout
the
term
could
nothing
be
done
for
poor
ansell
it
seemed
that
she
could
not
rest
until
all
that
he
had
once
held
dear
was
humiliated
in
this
she
strayed
outside
her
nature
she
was
unpractical
and
those
who
stray
outside
their
nature
invite
disaster
rickie
goaded
by
her
wrote
to
his
friend
again
the
letter
was
in
all
ways
unlike
his
old
self
ansell
did
not
answer
it
but
he
did
write
to
jackson
with
whom
he
was
not
acquainted
dear
jackson
i
understand
from
widdrington
that
you
have
a
large
house
i
would
like
to
tell
you
how
convenient
it
would
be
for
me
to
come
and
stop
in
it
june
suits
me
yours
truly
stewart
ansell
to
which
jackson
replied
that
not
only
in
june
but
during
the
whole
year
his
house
was
at
the
disposal
of
ansell
and
of
any
one
who
resembled
him
but
agnes
continued
her
life
cheerfully
beating
time
she
too
knew
that
her
marriage
was
a
failure
and
in
her
spare
moments
regretted
it
she
wished
that
her
husband
was
handsomer
more
successful
more
dictatorial
but
she
would
think
no
no
one
mustn
t
grumble
it
can
t
be
ansell
was
wrong
in
she
might
ever
leave
rickie
spiritual
apathy
prevented
her
nor
would
she
ever
be
tempted
by
a
jollier
man
here
criticism
would
willingly
alter
its
tone
for
agnes
also
has
her
tragedy
she
belonged
to
the
type
not
necessarily
an
elevated
one
that
loves
once
and
once
only
her
love
for
gerald
had
not
been
a
noble
passion
no
imagination
transfigured
it
but
such
as
it
was
it
sprang
to
embrace
him
and
he
carried
it
away
with
him
when
he
died

by
an
effort
of
the
will
she
had
warmed
herself
for
rickie
she
is
not
conscious
of
her
tragedy
and
therefore
only
the
gods
need
weep
at
it
but
it
is
fair
to
remember
that
hitherto
she
moves
as
one
from
whom
the
inner
life
has
been
withdrawn
xxv
i
am
afraid
said
agnes
unfolding
a
letter
that
she
had
received
in
the
morning
that
things
go
far
from
satisfactorily
at
the
three
were
alone
at
supper
it
was
the
june
of
rickie
s
second
year
at
sawston
indeed
said
herbert
who
took
a
friendly
interest
in
what
way
do
you
remember
us
talking
of
stephen
stephen
wonham
who
by
an
odd
coincidence
yes
who
wrote
last
year
to
that
miserable
failure
varden
i
it
is
about
i
did
not
like
the
tone
of
his
agnes
had
made
her
first
move
she
waited
for
her
husband
to
reply
to
it
but
he
though
full
of
a
painful
curiosity
would
not
speak
she
moved
again
i
don
t
think
herbert
that
aunt
emily
much
as
i
like
her
is
the
kind
of
person
to
bring
a
young
man
up
at
all
events
the
results
have
been
disastrous
this
what
has
happened
a
tangle
of
she
lowered
her
voice
dear
really
was
mrs
failing
fond
of
him
she
used
to
be
she
let
him
live
at
cadover
ever
since
he
was
a
little
boy
naturally
that
can
not
rickie
never
spoke
and
now
he
has
taken
to
be
violent
and
rude
she
went
on
in
short
a
beggar
on
horseback
who
is
he
has
he
got
relatives
she
has
always
been
both
father
and
mother
to
him
now
it
must
all
come
to
an
end
i
blame
her
and
she
blames
herself
for
not
being
severe
enough
he
has
grown
up
without
fixed
principles
he
has
always
followed
his
inclinations
and
one
knows
the
result
of
herbert
assented
to
me
failing
s
course
is
perfectly
plain
she
has
a
certain
responsibility
she
must
pay
the
youth
s
passage
to
one
of
the
colonies
start
him
handsomely
in
some
business
and
then
break
off
all
how
funny
it
is
exactly
what
she
is
going
to
i
shall
then
consider
that
she
has
behaved
in
a
thoroughly
honourable
he
held
out
his
plate
for
gooseberries
his
letter
to
varden
was
neither
helpful
nor
sympathetic
and
if
written
at
all
it
ought
to
have
been
both
i
am
not
in
the
least
surprised
to
learn
that
he
has
turned
out
badly
when
you
write
next
would
you
tell
her
how
sorry
i
am
indeed
i
will
two
years
ago
when
she
was
already
a
little
anxious
she
did
so
wish
you
could
undertake
him
i
could
not
alter
a
grown
but
in
his
heart
he
thought
he
could
and
smiled
at
his
sister
amiably
terrible
isn
t
it
he
remarked
to
rickie
rickie
who
was
trying
not
to
mind
anything
assented
and
an
onlooker
would
have
supposed
them
a
dispassionate
trio
who
were
sorry
both
for
mrs
failing
and
for
the
beggar
who
would
bestride
her
horses
backs
no
longer
a
new
topic
was
introduced
by
the
arrival
of
the
evening
post
herbert
took
up
all
the
letters
as
he
often
did
jackson
he
exclaimed
what
does
the
fellow
want
he
read
and
his
tone
was
mollified
dear
pembroke
could
you
elliot
and
elliot
come
to
supper
with
us
on
saturday
next
i
should
not
merely
be
pleased
i
should
be
grateful
my
wife
is
writing
formally
to
elliot
here
agnes
take
your
letter
but
i
venture
to
write
as
well
and
to
add
my
more
uncouth
an
it
is
time
but
ridiculous
person
does
he
think
that
we
can
leave
the
house
deserted
and
all
go
out
pleasuring
in
term
time
rickie
a
letter
for
mine
s
the
formal
invitation
said
agnes
how
very
odd
ansell
will
be
there
surely
we
asked
him
here
did
you
know
he
knew
the
jacksons
this
makes
refusal
very
difficult
said
herbert
who
was
anxious
to
accept
at
all
events
rickie
ought
to
i
do
not
want
to
go
said
rickie
slowly
opening
his
own
letter
as
agnes
says
ansell
has
refused
to
come
to
us
i
can
not
put
myself
out
for
who
s
yours
from
she
demanded
mrs
silt
replied
herbert
who
had
seen
the
handwriting
i
trust
she
does
not
want
to
pay
us
a
visit
this
term
with
the
examinations
impending
and
all
the
machinery
at
full
pressure
though
rickie
you
will
have
to
accept
the
jacksons
i
can
not
possibly
go
i
have
been
too
rude
with
widdrington
we
always
meet
here
i
ll
stop
with
the
boys
his
voice
caught
suddenly
he
had
opened
silt
s
letter
the
silts
are
not
ill
i
hope
no
but
i
say
he
looked
at
his
wife
i
do
think
this
is
going
too
far
really
what
has
happened
it
is
going
too
far
he
repeated
he
was
nerving
himself
for
another
battle
i
can
not
stand
this
sort
of
thing
there
are
he
laid
the
letter
down
it
was
herbert
who
picked
it
up
and
read
aunt
emily
has
just
written
to
us
we
are
so
glad
that
her
troubles
are
over
in
spite
of
the
expense
it
never
does
to
live
apart
from
one
s
own
relatives
so
much
as
she
has
done
up
to
now
he
goes
next
saturday
to
canada
what
you
told
her
about
him
just
turned
the
scale
she
has
asked
us
no
it
s
too
much
he
interrupted
what
i
told
her
told
her
about
him
no
i
will
have
it
out
at
last
agnes
yes
said
his
wife
raising
her
eyes
from
jackson
s
formal
invitation
it
s
you
it
s
you
i
never
mentioned
him
to
her
why
i
ve
never
seen
her
or
written
to
her
since
i
accuse
then
herbert
overbore
him
and
he
collapsed
he
was
asked
what
he
meant
why
was
he
so
excited
of
what
did
he
accuse
his
wife
each
time
he
spoke
more
feebly
and
before
long
the
brother
and
sister
were
laughing
at
him
he
felt
bewildered
like
a
boy
who
knows
that
he
is
right
but
can
not
put
his
case
correctly
he
repeated
i
ve
never
mentioned
him
to
her
it
s
a
libel
never
in
my
and
they
cried
my
dear
rickie
what
an
absurd
fuss
then
his
brain
cleared
his
eye
fell
on
the
letter
that
his
wife
had
received
from
his
aunt
and
he
reopened
the
battle
agnes
give
me
that
letter
if
you
mrs
jackson
s
my
aunt
she
put
her
hand
on
it
and
looked
at
him
doubtfully
she
saw
that
she
had
failed
to
bully
him
my
aunt
s
letter
he
repeated
rising
to
his
feet
and
bending
over
the
table
towards
her
why
dear
yes
why
indeed
echoed
herbert
he
too
had
bullied
rickie
but
from
a
purer
motive
he
had
tried
to
stamp
out
a
dissension
between
husband
and
wife
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
intervened
the
letter
for
this
reason
it
will
show
me
what
you
have
done
i
believe
you
have
ruined
stephen
you
have
worked
at
it
for
two
years
you
have
put
words
into
my
mouth
to
turn
the
scale
against
him
he
goes
to
canada
and
all
the
world
thinks
it
is
owing
to
me
as
i
said
before
i
advise
you
to
stop
smiling
you
have
gone
a
little
too
they
were
all
on
their
feet
now
standing
round
the
little
table
agnes
said
nothing
but
the
fingers
of
her
delicate
hand
tightened
upon
the
letter
when
her
husband
snatched
at
it
she
resisted
and
with
the
effect
of
a
harlequinade
everything
went
on
the
floor
lamb
mint
sauce
gooseberries
lemonade
whisky
at
once
they
were
swamped
in
domesticities
she
rang
the
bell
for
the
servant
cries
arose
dusters
were
brought
broken
crockery
a
wedding
present
picked
up
from
the
carpet
while
he
stood
wrathfully
at
the
window
regarding
the
obscured
sun
s
decline
i
must
see
her
letter
he
repeated
when
the
agitation
was
over
he
was
too
angry
to
be
diverted
from
his
purpose
only
slight
emotions
are
thwarted
by
an
interlude
of
farce
i
ve
had
enough
of
this
quarrelling
she
retorted
you
know
that
the
silts
are
inaccurate
i
think
you
might
have
given
me
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
if
you
will
know
have
you
forgotten
that
ride
you
took
with
him
i
he
was
again
bewildered
the
ride
where
i
dreamt
the
ride
where
you
turned
back
because
you
could
not
listen
to
a
disgraceful
poem
i
don
t
the
poem
was
aunt
emily
he
read
it
to
you
and
a
stray
soldier
afterwards
you
told
me
you
said
really
it
is
shocking
his
ingratitude
she
ought
to
know
about
it
she
does
know
and
i
should
be
glad
of
an
he
had
said
something
of
the
sort
in
a
fit
of
irritation
silt
was
right
he
had
helped
to
turn
the
scale
whatever
i
said
you
knew
what
i
meant
you
knew
i
d
sooner
cut
my
tongue
out
than
have
it
used
against
him
even
he
sighed
had
he
ruined
his
brother
a
curious
tenderness
came
over
him
and
passed
when
he
remembered
his
own
dead
child
we
have
ruined
him
then
have
you
any
objection
to
we
we
have
disinherited
i
decide
against
you
interposed
herbert
i
have
now
heard
both
sides
of
this
deplorable
affair
you
are
talking
most
criminal
nonsense
disinherit
sentimental
twaddle
it
s
been
clear
to
me
from
the
first
that
mrs
failing
has
been
imposed
upon
by
the
wonham
man
a
person
with
no
legal
claim
on
her
and
any
one
who
exposes
him
performs
a
public
duty
and
gets
money
he
was
always
uneasy
at
the
word
who
mentioned
money
just
understand
me
herbert
and
of
what
it
is
that
i
accuse
my
tears
came
into
his
eyes
it
is
not
that
i
like
the
wonham
man
or
think
that
he
isn
t
a
drunkard
and
worse
he
s
too
awful
in
every
way
but
he
ought
to
have
my
aunt
s
money
because
he
s
lived
all
his
life
with
her
and
is
her
nephew
as
much
as
i
am
you
see
my
father
went
he
stopped
amazed
at
himself
how
easy
it
had
been
to
say
he
was
withering
up
the
power
to
care
about
this
stupid
secret
had
died
when
herbert
understood
his
first
thought
was
for
dunwood
house
why
have
i
never
been
told
was
his
first
remark
we
settled
to
tell
no
one
said
agnes
rickie
in
his
anxiety
to
prove
me
a
liar
has
broken
his
i
ought
to
have
been
told
said
herbert
his
anger
increasing
had
i
known
i
could
have
averted
this
deplorable
let
me
conclude
it
said
rickie
again
collapsing
and
leaving
the
his
impulse
was
to
go
straight
to
cadover
and
make
a
statement
of
the
position
to
stephen
then
the
man
would
be
armed
and
perhaps
fight
the
two
women
successfully
but
he
resisted
the
impulse
why
should
he
help
one
power
of
evil
against
another
let
them
go
intertwined
to
destruction
to
enrich
his
brother
would
be
as
bad
as
enriching
himself
if
their
aunt
s
money
ever
did
come
to
him
he
would
refuse
to
accept
it
that
was
the
easiest
and
most
dignified
course
he
troubled
himself
no
longer
with
justice
or
pity
and
the
next
day
he
asked
his
wife
s
pardon
for
his
behaviour
in
the
the
conversation
continued
agnes
without
much
difficulty
gained
her
brother
as
an
ally
she
acknowledged
that
she
had
been
wrong
in
not
telling
him
and
he
then
declared
that
she
had
been
right
on
every
other
point
she
slurred
a
little
over
the
incident
of
her
treachery
for
herbert
was
sometimes
clearsighted
over
details
though
easily
muddled
in
a
general
survey
mrs
failing
had
had
plenty
of
direct
causes
of
complaint
and
she
dwelt
on
these
she
dealt
too
on
the
very
handsome
way
in
which
the
young
man
though
he
knew
nothing
had
never
asked
to
know
was
being
treated
by
his
aunt
handsome
is
the
word
said
herbert
i
hope
not
indulgently
he
does
not
deserve
and
she
knew
that
he
like
herself
could
remember
money
and
that
it
lent
an
acknowledged
halo
to
her
cause
it
is
not
a
savoury
subject
he
continued
with
sudden
stiffness
i
understand
why
rickie
is
so
hysterical
my
impulse
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
is
to
abandon
it
at
once
but
if
i
am
to
be
of
any
use
to
you
i
must
hear
it
all
there
are
moments
when
we
must
look
facts
in
the
she
did
not
shrink
from
the
subject
as
much
as
he
thought
as
much
as
she
herself
could
have
wished
two
years
before
it
had
filled
her
with
a
physical
loathing
but
by
now
she
had
accustomed
herself
to
it
i
am
afraid
bertie
boy
there
is
nothing
else
to
bear
i
have
tried
to
find
out
again
and
again
but
aunt
emily
will
not
tell
me
i
suppose
it
is
natural
she
wants
to
shield
the
elliot
name
she
only
told
us
in
a
fit
of
temper
then
we
all
agreed
to
keep
it
to
ourselves
then
rickie
again
mismanaged
her
and
ever
since
she
has
refused
to
let
us
know
any
a
most
unsatisfactory
so
i
she
sat
down
again
with
a
sigh
mrs
failing
had
been
a
great
trial
to
her
orderly
mind
she
is
an
odd
woman
she
is
always
laughing
she
actually
finds
it
amusing
that
we
know
no
they
are
an
odd
they
are
herbert
with
unusual
sweetness
bent
down
and
kissed
her
she
thanked
him
their
tenderness
soon
passed
they
exchanged
it
with
averted
eyes
it
embarrassed
them
there
are
moments
for
all
of
us
when
we
seem
obliged
to
speak
in
a
new
unprofitable
tongue
one
might
fancy
a
seraph
vexed
with
our
normal
language
who
touches
the
pious
to
blasphemy
the
blasphemous
to
piety
the
seraph
passes
and
we
proceed
unaltered
conscious
however
that
we
have
not
been
ourselves
and
that
we
may
fail
in
this
function
yet
again
so
agnes
and
herbert
as
they
proceeded
to
discuss
the
jackson
s
had
an
uneasy
memory
of
spiritual
deserts
spiritual
streams
xxvi
poor
ansell
was
actually
sitting
in
the
garden
of
dunwood
house
it
was
sunday
morning
the
air
was
full
of
roasting
beef
the
sound
of
a
manly
hymn
taken
very
fast
floated
over
the
road
from
the
school
chapel
he
frowned
for
he
was
reading
a
book
the
essays
of
anthony
eustace
failing
he
was
here
on
account
of
this
book
at
least
so
he
told
himself
it
had
just
been
published
and
the
jacksons
were
sure
that
elliot
would
have
a
copy
for
a
book
one
may
go
anywhere
it
would
not
have
been
logical
to
enter
dunwood
house
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
rickie
when
rickie
had
not
come
to
supper
yesterday
to
see
him
he
was
at
sawston
to
assure
himself
of
his
friend
s
grave
with
quiet
eyes
he
had
intended
to
view
the
sods
with
unfaltering
fingers
to
inscribe
the
epitaph
love
remained
but
in
high
matters
he
was
practical
he
knew
that
it
would
be
useless
to
reveal
it
morning
said
a
voice
behind
him
he
saw
no
reason
to
reply
to
this
superfluous
statement
and
went
on
with
his
reading
morning
said
the
voice
again
as
for
the
essays
the
thought
was
somewhat
and
he
picked
many
holes
in
it
nor
was
he
anything
but
bored
by
the
prospect
of
the
brotherhood
of
man
however
mr
failing
stuck
to
his
guns
such
as
they
were
and
fired
from
them
several
good
remarks
very
notable
was
his
distinction
between
coarseness
and
vulgarity
coarseness
revealing
something
vulgarity
concealing
something
and
his
avowed
preference
for
coarseness
vulgarity
to
him
had
been
the
primal
curse
the
shoddy
reticence
that
prevents
man
opening
his
heart
to
man
the
power
that
makes
against
equality
from
it
sprang
all
the
things
that
he
hated
class
shibboleths
ladies
lidies
the
game
laws
the
conservative
party
all
the
things
that
accent
the
divergencies
rather
than
the
similarities
in
human
nature
whereas
coarseness
but
at
this
point
herbert
pembroke
had
scrawled
with
a
blue
pencil
childish
one
reads
no
morning
repeated
the
voice
ansell
read
further
for
here
was
the
book
of
a
man
who
had
tried
however
unsuccessfully
to
practice
what
he
preached
mrs
failing
in
her
introduction
described
with
delicate
irony
his
difficulties
as
a
landlord
but
she
did
not
record
the
love
in
which
his
name
was
held
nor
could
her
irony
touch
him
when
he
cried
attain
the
practical
through
the
unpractical
there
is
no
other
ansell
was
inclined
to
think
that
the
unpractical
is
its
own
reward
but
he
respected
those
who
attempted
to
journey
beyond
it
we
must
all
of
us
go
over
the
mountains
there
is
certainly
no
other
road
nice
morning
said
the
voice
it
was
not
a
nice
morning
so
ansell
felt
bound
to
speak
he
answered
no
why
a
clod
of
earth
immediately
struck
him
on
the
back
he
turned
round
indignantly
for
he
hated
physical
rudeness
a
square
man
of
ruddy
aspect
was
pacing
the
gravel
path
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
he
was
very
angry
then
he
saw
that
the
clod
of
earth
nourished
a
blue
lobelia
and
that
a
wound
of
corresponding
size
appeared
on
the
bed
he
was
not
so
angry
i
expect
they
will
mind
it
he
reflected
last
night
at
the
jacksons
agnes
had
displayed
a
brisk
pity
that
made
him
wish
to
wring
her
neck
maude
had
not
exaggerated
pembroke
had
patronized
through
a
sorrowful
voice
and
large
round
eyes
till
he
met
these
people
he
had
never
been
told
that
his
career
was
a
failure
apparently
it
was
they
would
never
have
been
civil
to
him
if
it
had
been
a
success
if
they
or
theirs
had
anything
to
fear
from
him
in
many
ways
ansell
was
a
conceited
man
but
he
was
never
proud
of
being
right
he
had
foreseen
rickie
s
catastrophe
from
the
first
but
derived
from
this
no
consolation
in
many
ways
he
was
pedantic
but
his
pedantry
lay
close
to
the
vineyards
of
life
far
closer
than
that
fetich
experience
of
the
innumerable
he
had
a
great
many
facts
to
learn
and
before
he
died
he
learnt
a
suitable
quantity
but
he
never
forgot
that
the
holiness
of
the
heart
s
imagination
can
alone
classify
these
facts
can
alone
decide
which
is
an
exception
which
an
example
how
unpractical
it
all
is
that
was
his
comment
on
dunwood
house
how
they
live
together
without
love
they
work
without
conviction
they
seek
money
without
requiring
it
they
die
and
nothing
will
have
happened
either
for
themselves
or
for
it
is
a
comment
that
the
academic
mind
will
often
make
when
first
confronted
with
the
world
but
he
was
becoming
illogical
the
clod
of
earth
had
disturbed
him
brushing
the
dirt
off
his
back
he
returned
to
the
book
what
a
curious
affair
was
the
essay
on
gaps
solitude
pacing
the
fields
of
england
has
a
dialogue
with
seclusion
he
poor
little
man
lives
in
the
choicest
scenery
among
rocks
forests
emerald
lawns
azure
lakes
to
keep
people
out
he
has
built
round
his
domain
a
high
wall
on
which
is
graven
his
motto
procul
este
but
he
can
not
enjoy
himself
his
only
pleasure
is
in
mocking
the
absent
profane
they
are
in
his
mind
night
and
day
their
blemishes
and
stupidities
form
the
subject
of
his
great
poem
in
the
heart
of
then
solitude
tells
him
that
so
it
always
will
be
until
he
makes
a
gap
in
the
wall
and
permits
his
seclusion
to
be
the
sport
of
circumstance
he
obeys
the
profane
invade
him
but
for
short
intervals
they
wander
elsewhere
and
during
those
intervals
the
heart
of
nature
is
revealed
to
him
this
dialogue
had
really
been
suggested
to
mr
failing
by
a
talk
with
his
it
also
touched
ansell
he
looked
at
the
man
who
had
thrown
the
clod
and
was
now
pacing
with
obvious
youth
and
impudence
upon
the
lawn
shall
i
improve
my
soul
at
his
expense
he
thought
i
suppose
i
had
in
friendly
tones
he
remarked
were
you
waiting
for
pembroke
no
said
the
young
man
why
ansell
after
a
moment
s
admiration
flung
the
essays
at
him
they
hit
him
in
the
back
the
next
moment
he
lay
on
his
own
back
in
the
lobelia
pie
but
it
hurts
he
gasped
in
the
tones
of
a
puzzled
civilization
what
you
do
hurts
for
the
young
man
was
nicking
him
over
the
shins
with
the
rim
of
the
book
cover
little
ow
then
say
pax
something
revolted
in
ansell
why
should
he
say
pax
freeing
his
hand
he
caught
the
little
brute
under
the
chin
and
was
again
knocked
into
the
lobelias
by
a
blow
on
the
mouth
say
pax
he
repeated
pressing
the
philosopher
s
skull
into
the
mould
and
he
added
with
an
anxiety
that
was
somehow
not
offensive
i
do
advise
you
you
d
really
ansell
swallowed
a
little
blood
he
tried
to
move
and
he
could
not
he
looked
carefully
into
the
young
man
s
eyes
and
into
the
palm
of
his
right
hand
which
at
present
swung
unclenched
and
he
said
pax
shake
hands
said
the
other
helping
him
up
there
was
nothing
ansell
loathed
so
much
as
the
hearty
britisher
but
he
shook
hands
and
they
stared
at
each
other
awkwardly
with
civil
murmurs
they
picked
the
little
blue
flowers
off
each
other
s
clothes
ansell
was
trying
to
remember
why
they
had
quarrelled
and
the
young
man
was
wondering
why
he
had
not
guarded
his
chin
properly
in
the
distance
a
hymn
swung
off
fight
the
good
fight
with
all
thy
they
would
be
across
from
the
chapel
soon
your
book
sir
thank
you
sir
why
cried
the
young
man
why
it
s
what
we
want
at
least
the
binding
s
exactly
the
it
s
called
essays
said
ansell
then
that
s
it
mrs
failing
you
see
she
wouldn
t
call
it
that
because
three
w
s
you
see
in
a
row
she
said
are
vulgar
and
sound
like
tolstoy
if
you
ve
heard
of
ansell
confessed
to
an
acquaintance
and
then
said
do
you
think
what
we
want
vulgar
he
was
not
at
all
interested
but
he
desired
to
escape
from
the
atmosphere
of
pugilistic
courtesy
more
painful
to
him
than
blows
themselves
it
is
the
same
book
said
the
other
same
title
same
he
weighed
it
like
a
brick
in
his
muddy
hands
open
it
to
see
if
the
inside
corresponds
said
ansell
swallowing
a
laugh
and
a
little
more
blood
with
it
with
a
liberal
allowance
of
he
turned
the
pages
over
and
read
the
rural
silence
that
is
not
a
poet
s
luxury
but
a
practical
need
for
all
yes
it
is
the
same
smiling
pleasantly
over
the
discovery
he
handed
it
back
to
the
owner
and
is
it
true
i
beg
your
pardon
is
it
true
that
rural
silence
is
a
practical
need
don
t
ask
me
have
you
ever
tried
it
what
rural
a
field
with
no
noise
in
it
i
suppose
you
mean
i
don
t
ansell
smiled
but
a
slight
fire
in
the
man
s
eye
checked
him
after
all
this
was
a
person
who
could
knock
one
down
moreover
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
be
teased
he
had
it
in
him
to
retort
no
why
he
was
not
stupid
in
essentials
he
was
irritable
in
ansell
s
eyes
a
frequent
sign
of
grace
sitting
down
on
the
upturned
seat
he
remarked
i
like
the
book
in
many
ways
i
don
t
think
what
we
want
would
have
been
a
vulgar
title
but
i
don
t
intend
to
spoil
myself
on
the
chance
of
mending
the
world
which
is
what
the
creed
amounts
to
nor
am
i
keen
on
rural
curse
he
said
thoughtfully
sucking
at
an
empty
pipe
tobacco
rickie
s
is
invariably
who
says
i
know
rickie
well
you
know
his
aunt
it
s
a
possible
link
be
gentle
with
rickie
don
t
knock
him
down
if
he
doesn
t
think
it
s
a
nice
the
other
was
silent
do
you
know
him
well
kind
he
was
not
inclined
to
talk
the
wish
to
smoke
was
very
violent
in
him
and
ansell
noticed
how
he
gazed
at
the
wreaths
that
ascended
from
bowl
and
stem
and
how
when
the
stem
was
in
his
mouth
he
bit
it
he
gave
the
idea
of
an
animal
with
just
enough
soul
to
contemplate
its
own
bliss
united
with
refinement
such
a
type
was
common
in
greece
it
is
not
common
today
and
ansell
was
surprised
to
find
it
in
a
friend
of
rickie
s
rickie
if
he
could
even
kind
of
know
such
a
creature
must
be
stirring
in
his
grave
do
you
know
his
wife
too
oh
yes
in
a
way
i
know
agnes
but
thank
you
for
this
tobacco
last
night
i
nearly
died
i
have
no
take
the
whole
pouch
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
he
did
fight
the
good
had
scarcely
ended
so
quickly
had
their
intimacy
grown
i
suppose
you
re
a
friend
of
rickie
s
ansell
was
tempted
to
reply
i
don
t
know
him
at
but
it
seemed
no
moment
for
the
severer
truths
so
he
said
i
knew
him
well
at
cambridge
but
i
have
seen
very
little
of
him
is
it
true
that
his
baby
was
lame
i
believe
his
teeth
closed
on
his
pipe
chapel
was
over
the
organist
was
prancing
through
the
voluntary
and
the
first
ripple
of
boys
had
already
reached
dunwood
house
in
a
few
minutes
the
masters
would
be
here
too
and
ansell
who
was
becoming
interested
hurried
the
conversation
forward
have
you
come
far
from
wiltshire
do
you
know
wiltshire
and
for
the
first
time
there
came
into
his
face
the
shadow
of
a
sentiment
the
passing
tribute
to
some
mystery
it
s
a
good
country
i
live
in
one
of
the
finest
valleys
out
of
salisbury
plain
i
mean
i
have
you
been
dismissed
from
cadover
without
a
penny
in
your
pocket
he
was
alarmed
at
this
such
knowledge
seemed
simply
diabolical
ansell
explained
that
if
his
boots
were
chalky
if
his
clothes
had
obviously
been
slept
in
if
he
knew
mrs
failing
if
he
knew
wiltshire
and
if
he
could
buy
no
tobacco
then
the
deduction
was
possible
you
do
just
attend
he
murmured
the
house
was
filling
with
boys
and
ansell
saw
to
his
regret
the
head
of
agnes
over
the
thuyia
hedge
that
separated
the
small
front
garden
from
the
side
lawn
where
he
was
sitting
after
a
few
minutes
it
was
followed
by
the
heads
of
rickie
and
pembroke
all
the
heads
were
turned
the
other
way
but
they
would
find
his
card
in
the
hall
and
if
the
man
had
left
any
message
they
would
find
that
too
what
are
you
he
demanded
who
are
you
your
name
i
don
t
care
about
that
but
it
interests
me
to
class
people
and
up
to
now
i
have
failed
with
i
he
stopped
ansell
reflected
that
there
are
worse
answers
i
really
don
t
know
what
i
am
used
to
think
i
was
something
special
but
strikes
me
now
i
feel
much
like
other
chaps
used
to
look
down
on
the
labourers
used
to
take
for
granted
i
was
a
gentleman
but
really
i
don
t
know
where
i
do
one
belongs
to
the
place
one
sleeps
in
and
to
the
people
one
eats
as
often
as
not
i
sleep
out
of
doors
and
eat
by
myself
so
that
doesn
t
get
you
any
a
silence
akin
to
poetry
invaded
ansell
was
it
only
a
pose
to
like
this
man
or
was
he
really
wonderful
he
was
not
romantic
for
romance
is
a
figure
with
outstretched
hands
yearning
for
the
unattainable
certain
figures
of
the
greeks
to
whom
we
continually
return
suggested
him
a
little
one
expected
nothing
of
him
no
purity
of
phrase
nor
swift
edged
thought
yet
the
conviction
grew
that
he
had
been
back
somewhere
back
to
some
table
of
the
gods
spread
in
a
field
where
there
is
no
noise
and
that
he
belonged
for
ever
to
the
guests
with
whom
he
had
eaten
meanwhile
he
was
simple
and
frank
and
what
he
could
tell
he
would
tell
to
any
one
he
had
not
the
suburban
reticence
ansell
asked
him
why
did
mrs
failing
turn
you
out
of
cadover
i
should
like
to
hear
that
because
she
was
tired
of
me
because
again
i
couldn
t
keep
quiet
over
the
farm
hands
i
ask
you
is
it
right
he
became
incoherent
ansell
caught
and
they
grow
old
they
don
t
play
games
it
ends
they
can
t
an
illustration
emerged
take
a
kitten
if
you
fool
about
with
her
she
goes
on
playing
well
into
a
but
mrs
failing
minded
no
mice
being
mice
said
the
young
man
blankly
what
i
was
going
to
say
is
that
some
one
was
jealous
of
my
being
at
cadover
i
ll
mention
no
names
but
i
fancy
it
was
silt
i
m
sorry
for
her
if
it
was
anyhow
she
set
mrs
failing
against
me
it
came
on
the
top
of
other
things
and
out
i
what
did
silt
whose
name
i
don
t
mention
say
he
looked
guilty
i
don
t
know
easy
enough
to
find
something
to
say
the
point
is
that
she
said
something
you
know
i
don
t
know
your
name
mine
s
wonham
but
i
m
more
grateful
than
i
can
put
it
over
this
tobacco
i
mean
you
ought
to
know
there
is
another
side
to
this
quarrel
it
s
wrong
but
it
s
ansell
told
him
not
to
be
uneasy
he
lad
already
guessed
that
there
might
be
another
side
but
he
could
not
make
out
why
wonham
should
have
come
straight
from
the
aunt
to
the
nephew
they
were
now
sitting
on
the
upturned
seat
what
we
want
a
good
deal
shattered
lay
between
them
on
account
of
reasons
there
was
a
row
i
don
t
know
you
can
guess
the
style
of
thing
she
wanted
to
treat
me
to
the
colonies
and
had
up
the
parson
to
talk
and
make
out
that
a
boundless
continent
was
the
place
for
a
lad
like
me
i
said
i
can
t
run
up
to
the
rings
without
getting
tired
nor
gallop
a
horse
out
of
this
view
without
tiring
it
so
what
is
the
point
of
a
boundless
continent
then
i
saw
that
she
was
frightened
of
me
and
bluffed
a
bit
more
and
in
the
end
i
was
nipped
she
caught
me
just
like
her
when
i
had
nothing
on
but
flannels
and
was
coming
into
the
house
having
licked
the
cadchurch
team
she
stood
up
in
the
doorway
between
those
stone
pilasters
and
said
no
never
again
and
behind
her
was
wilbraham
whom
i
tried
to
turn
out
and
the
gardener
and
poor
old
leighton
who
hates
being
hurt
she
said
there
s
a
hundred
pounds
for
you
at
the
london
bank
and
as
much
more
in
december
go
i
said
keep
your
money
and
tell
me
whose
son
i
i
didn
t
care
really
i
only
said
it
on
the
of
hurting
her
sure
enough
she
caught
on
to
the
doorhandle
being
lame
and
said
i
can
t
i
promised
i
don
t
really
want
to
and
wilbraham
did
stare
then
she
s
very
queer
she
burst
out
laughing
and
went
for
the
packet
after
all
and
we
heard
her
laugh
through
the
window
as
she
got
it
she
rolled
it
at
me
down
the
steps
and
she
says
a
leaf
out
of
the
eternal
comedy
for
you
stephen
or
something
of
that
sort
i
opened
it
as
i
walked
down
the
drive
she
laughing
always
and
catching
on
to
the
handle
of
the
front
door
of
course
it
wasn
t
comic
at
all
but
down
in
the
village
there
were
both
cricket
teams
already
a
little
tight
and
the
mad
plumber
shouting
rights
of
man
they
knew
i
was
turned
out
we
did
have
a
row
and
kept
it
up
too
they
daren
t
touch
wilbraham
s
windows
but
there
isn
t
much
glass
left
up
at
cadover
when
you
start
it
s
worth
going
on
but
in
the
end
i
had
to
cut
they
subscribed
a
bob
here
and
a
bob
there
and
these
are
flea
thompson
s
sundays
i
sent
a
line
to
leighton
not
to
forward
my
own
things
i
don
t
fancy
them
they
aren
t
really
he
did
not
mention
his
great
symbolic
act
performed
it
is
to
be
feared
when
he
was
rather
drunk
and
the
friendly
policeman
was
looking
the
other
way
he
had
cast
all
his
flannels
into
the
little
millpond
and
then
waded
himself
through
the
dark
cold
water
to
the
new
clothes
on
the
other
side
some
one
had
flung
his
pipe
and
his
packet
after
him
the
packet
had
fallen
short
for
this
reason
it
was
wet
when
he
handed
it
to
ansell
and
ink
that
had
been
dry
for
years
had
begun
to
run
again
i
wondered
if
you
re
right
about
the
hundred
pounds
said
ansell
gravely
it
is
pleasant
to
be
proud
but
it
is
unpleasant
to
die
in
the
night
through
not
having
any
but
i
m
not
proud
look
how
i
ve
taken
your
pouch
the
hundred
pounds
was
well
can
t
you
see
yourself
it
was
quite
different
it
was
so
to
speak
inconvenient
for
me
to
take
the
hundred
pounds
or
look
again
how
i
took
a
shilling
from
a
boy
who
earns
nine
bob
proves
pretty
conclusively
i
m
not
ansell
saw
it
was
useless
to
argue
he
perceived
beneath
the
slatternly
use
of
words
the
man
buttoned
up
in
them
just
as
his
body
was
buttoned
up
in
a
shoddy
suit
and
he
wondered
more
than
ever
that
such
a
man
should
know
the
elliots
he
looked
at
the
face
which
was
frank
proud
and
beautiful
if
truth
is
beauty
of
mercy
or
tact
such
a
face
knew
little
it
might
be
coarse
but
it
had
in
it
nothing
vulgar
or
wantonly
cruel
may
i
read
these
papers
he
said
of
course
oh
yes
didn
t
i
say
i
m
rickie
s
come
here
to
tell
him
the
news
he
doesn
t
know
there
it
is
put
shortly
for
you
i
was
saying
though
that
i
bolted
in
the
dark
slept
in
the
above
salisbury
the
sheds
where
they
keep
the
cardboard
men
you
know
never
locked
up
as
they
ought
to
be
i
turned
the
whole
place
upside
down
to
teach
here
is
your
packet
again
said
ansell
thank
you
how
interesting
he
rose
from
the
seat
and
turned
towards
dunwood
house
he
looked
at
the
the
cheap
picturesque
gables
the
terracotta
dragons
clawing
a
dirty
sky
he
listened
to
the
clink
of
plates
and
to
the
voice
of
pembroke
taking
one
of
his
innumerable
he
looked
at
the
bed
of
lobelias
how
interesting
what
else
was
there
to
say
one
must
be
the
son
of
some
one
remarked
stephen
and
that
was
all
he
had
to
say
to
him
those
names
on
the
moistened
paper
were
mere
antiquities
he
was
neither
proud
of
them
nor
ashamed
a
man
must
have
parents
or
he
can
not
enter
the
delightful
world
a
man
if
he
has
a
brother
may
reasonably
visit
him
for
they
may
have
interests
in
common
he
continued
his
narrative
how
in
the
night
he
had
heard
the
clocks
how
at
daybreak
instead
of
entering
the
city
he
had
struck
eastward
to
save
money
while
ansell
still
looked
at
the
house
and
found
that
all
his
imagination
and
knowledge
could
lead
him
no
farther
than
this
how
interesting
and
what
do
you
think
of
that
for
a
holy
horror
for
a
what
said
ansell
his
thoughts
far
away
this
man
i
am
telling
you
about
who
gave
me
a
lift
towards
andover
who
said
i
was
a
blot
on
god
s
one
o
clock
struck
it
was
strange
that
neither
of
them
had
had
any
summons
from
the
house
he
said
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
myself
he
said
i
ll
not
be
the
means
of
bringing
shame
to
an
honest
gentleman
and
i
told
him
not
to
be
a
fool
i
said
i
knew
what
i
was
about
rickie
and
agnes
are
properly
educated
which
leads
people
to
look
at
things
straight
and
not
go
screaming
about
blots
a
man
like
me
with
just
a
little
reading
at
odd
hours
i
ve
got
so
far
and
rickie
has
been
through
and
elliot
oh
she
won
t
mind
and
i
told
the
man
so
but
he
kept
on
saying
i
ll
not
be
the
means
of
bringing
shame
to
an
honest
gentleman
and
lady
until
i
got
out
of
his
rotten
his
eye
watched
the
man
a
nonconformist
driving
away
over
god
s
earth
i
caught
the
train
by
running
i
got
to
waterloo
at
here
the
fluttered
towards
them
would
wonham
come
in
elliot
would
be
glad
to
see
him
now
mrs
elliot
cried
ansell
not
elliot
it
s
all
the
same
said
stephen
and
moved
towards
the
house
you
see
i
only
left
my
name
they
don
t
know
why
i
ve
perhaps
elliot
sees
me
meanwhile
the
looked
blank
elliot
had
not
said
so
he
had
been
with
elliot
and
pembroke
in
the
study
now
the
gentlemen
had
gone
upstairs
all
right
i
can
after
all
rickie
was
treating
him
as
he
had
treated
rickie
as
one
in
the
grave
to
whom
it
is
futile
to
make
any
loving
motion
gone
upstairs
to
brush
his
hair
for
dinner
the
irony
of
the
situation
appealed
to
him
strongly
it
reminded
him
of
the
greek
drama
where
the
actors
know
so
little
and
the
spectators
so
much
but
by
the
bye
he
called
after
stephen
i
think
i
ought
to
tell
you
don
t
what
is
it
don
t
then
he
was
silent
he
had
been
tempted
to
explain
everything
to
tell
the
fellow
how
things
stood
that
he
must
avoid
this
if
he
wanted
to
attain
that
that
he
must
break
the
news
to
rickie
gently
that
he
must
have
at
least
one
battle
royal
with
agnes
but
it
was
contrary
to
his
own
spirit
to
coach
people
he
held
the
human
soul
to
be
a
very
delicate
thing
which
can
receive
eternal
damage
from
a
little
patronage
stephen
must
go
into
the
house
simply
as
himself
for
thus
alone
would
he
remain
there
i
ought
to
knock
my
pipe
out
was
that
it
by
no
means
go
in
your
pipe
and
he
hesitated
torn
between
propriety
and
desire
then
he
followed
the
into
the
house
smoking
as
he
entered
the
rang
and
there
was
the
sound
of
rushing
feet
which
died
away
into
shuffling
and
silence
through
the
window
of
the
boys
came
the
colourless
voice
of
rickie
benedictus
ansell
prepared
himself
to
witness
the
second
act
of
the
drama
forgetting
that
all
this
world
and
not
part
of
it
is
a
stage
xxvii
the
took
wonham
to
the
study
he
had
been
in
the
before
but
had
got
bored
and
so
had
strolled
out
into
the
garden
now
he
was
in
better
spirits
as
a
man
ought
to
be
who
has
knocked
down
a
man
as
he
passed
through
the
hall
he
sparred
at
the
teak
monkey
and
hung
his
cap
on
the
bust
of
hermes
and
he
greeted
elliot
with
a
pleasant
clap
of
laughter
oh
i
ve
come
with
the
most
tremendous
news
he
cried
she
bowed
but
did
not
shake
hands
which
rather
surprised
him
but
he
never
troubled
over
he
seldom
watched
people
and
never
thought
that
they
were
watching
him
nor
could
he
guess
how
much
it
meant
to
her
that
he
should
enter
her
presence
smoking
had
she
not
said
once
at
cadover
oh
please
smoke
i
love
the
smell
of
a
pipe
would
you
sit
down
exactly
there
she
placed
him
at
a
large
table
opposite
an
inkpot
and
a
pad
of
will
you
tell
your
tremendous
news
to
me
my
brother
and
my
husband
are
giving
the
boys
their
ah
said
stephen
who
had
had
neither
time
nor
money
for
breakfast
in
london
i
told
them
not
to
wait
for
so
he
came
to
the
point
at
once
he
trusted
this
handsome
woman
his
strength
and
his
youth
called
to
hers
expecting
no
prudish
response
it
s
very
odd
it
is
that
i
m
rickie
s
brother
i
ve
just
found
out
i
ve
come
to
tell
you
yes
he
felt
in
his
pocket
for
the
papers
i
ought
to
have
yes
i
m
illegitimate
legally
speaking
that
is
i
ve
been
turned
out
of
cadover
i
haven
t
a
penny
i
there
is
no
occasion
to
inflict
the
her
face
which
had
been
an
even
brown
began
to
flush
slowly
in
the
centre
of
the
cheeks
the
colour
spread
till
all
that
he
saw
of
her
was
suffused
and
she
turned
away
he
thought
he
had
shocked
her
and
so
did
she
neither
knew
that
the
body
can
be
insincere
and
express
not
the
emotions
we
feel
but
those
that
we
should
like
to
feel
in
reality
she
was
quite
calm
and
her
dislike
of
him
had
nothing
emotional
in
it
as
yet
you
see
he
began
he
was
determined
to
tell
the
fidgety
story
for
the
sooner
it
was
over
the
sooner
they
would
have
something
to
eat
delicacy
he
lacked
and
his
sympathies
were
limited
but
such
as
they
were
they
rang
true
he
put
no
decorous
phantom
between
him
and
his
desires
i
do
see
i
have
seen
for
two
she
sat
down
at
the
head
of
the
table
where
there
was
another
into
this
she
dipped
a
pen
i
have
seen
everything
wonham
who
you
are
how
you
have
behaved
at
cadover
how
you
must
have
treated
mrs
failing
yesterday
and
now
her
voice
became
very
grave
i
see
why
you
have
come
here
penniless
before
you
speak
we
know
what
you
will
his
mouth
fell
open
and
he
laughed
so
merrily
that
it
might
have
given
her
a
warning
but
she
was
thinking
how
to
follow
up
her
first
success
and
i
thought
i
was
bringing
tremendous
news
he
cried
i
only
twisted
it
out
of
mrs
failing
last
night
and
rickie
knows
too
we
have
known
for
two
but
come
by
the
bye
if
you
ve
known
for
two
years
how
is
it
you
didn
t
the
laugh
died
out
of
his
eyes
you
aren
t
ashamed
he
asked
half
rising
from
his
chair
you
aren
t
like
the
man
towards
andover
please
please
sit
down
said
agnes
in
the
even
tones
she
used
when
speaking
to
the
servants
let
us
not
discuss
side
issues
i
am
a
horribly
direct
person
wonham
i
go
always
straight
to
the
she
opened
a
chequebook
i
am
afraid
i
shall
shock
you
for
how
much
he
was
not
attending
there
is
the
paper
we
suggest
you
shall
she
pushed
towards
him
a
document
just
composed
by
herbert
in
consideration
of
the
sum
of
i
agree
to
perpetual
silence
to
restrain
from
libellous
never
to
molest
the
said
frederick
elliot
by
intruding
his
brain
was
not
quick
he
read
the
document
over
twice
and
he
could
still
say
but
what
s
that
cheque
for
it
is
my
husband
s
he
signed
for
you
as
soon
as
we
heard
you
were
here
we
guessed
you
had
come
to
be
silenced
here
is
his
signature
but
he
has
left
the
filling
in
for
me
for
how
much
i
will
cross
it
shall
i
you
will
just
have
started
a
banking
account
if
i
understand
mrs
failing
rightly
it
is
not
quite
accurate
to
say
you
are
penniless
i
heard
from
her
just
before
you
returned
from
your
cricket
she
allows
you
two
hundred
i
think
but
this
additional
sum
shall
i
date
the
cheque
saturday
or
for
tomorrow
at
last
he
found
words
knocking
his
pipe
out
on
the
table
he
said
slowly
here
s
a
very
bad
it
is
quite
possible
retorted
agnes
she
was
glad
she
had
taken
the
offensive
instead
of
waiting
till
he
began
his
blackmailing
as
had
been
the
advice
of
rickie
aunt
emily
had
said
that
very
spring
one
s
only
hope
with
stephen
is
to
start
bullying
here
he
was
quite
bewildered
smearing
the
with
his
thumb
he
asked
to
read
the
document
again
a
stamp
and
all
he
remarked
they
had
anticipated
that
his
claim
would
exceed
two
pounds
i
see
all
right
it
takes
a
fool
a
minute
never
mind
i
ve
made
a
bad
you
refuse
she
exclaimed
for
he
was
standing
at
the
door
then
do
your
worst
we
defy
you
that
s
all
right
elliot
he
said
roughly
i
don
t
want
a
scene
with
you
nor
yet
with
your
husband
we
ll
say
no
more
about
it
it
s
all
right
i
mean
no
but
your
signature
then
you
must
sign
you
he
pushed
past
her
and
said
as
he
reached
for
his
cap
there
that
s
all
right
it
s
my
mistake
i
m
he
spoke
like
a
farmer
who
has
failed
to
sell
a
sheep
his
manner
was
utterly
prosaic
and
up
to
the
last
she
thought
he
had
not
understood
her
but
it
s
money
we
offer
you
she
informed
him
and
then
darted
back
to
the
study
believing
for
one
terrible
moment
that
he
had
picked
up
the
blank
cheque
when
she
returned
to
the
hall
he
had
gone
he
was
walking
down
the
road
rather
quickly
at
the
corner
he
cleared
his
throat
spat
into
the
gutter
and
disappeared
there
s
an
odd
finish
she
thought
she
was
puzzled
and
determined
to
recast
the
interview
a
little
when
she
related
it
to
rickie
she
had
not
succeeded
for
the
paper
was
still
unsigned
but
she
had
so
cowed
stephen
that
he
would
probably
rest
content
with
his
two
hundred
and
never
come
troubling
them
again
clever
management
for
one
knew
him
to
be
rapacious
she
had
heard
tales
of
him
lending
to
the
poor
and
exacting
repayment
to
the
uttermost
farthing
he
had
also
stolen
at
school
moderately
triumphant
she
hurried
into
the
she
had
just
remembered
ansell
she
not
rickie
had
received
his
card
oh
ansell
she
exclaimed
awaking
him
from
some
haven
t
either
rickie
or
herbert
been
out
to
you
now
do
come
into
dinner
to
show
you
aren
t
offended
you
will
find
all
of
us
assembled
in
the
boys
to
her
annoyance
he
accepted
that
is
if
the
jacksons
are
not
expecting
the
jacksons
did
not
matter
if
he
might
brush
his
clothes
and
bathe
his
lip
he
would
like
to
come
oh
what
has
happened
to
you
and
oh
my
pretty
lobelias
he
replied
a
momentary
contact
with
reality
and
she
who
did
not
look
for
sense
in
his
remarks
hurried
away
to
the
to
announce
him
the
was
not
unlike
the
preparation
room
there
was
the
same
parquet
floor
and
dado
of
shiny
pitchpine
on
its
walls
also
were
imperial
portraits
and
over
the
harmonium
to
which
they
sang
the
evening
hymns
was
spread
the
union
jack
sunday
dinner
the
most
pompous
meal
of
the
week
was
in
progress
her
brother
sat
at
the
head
of
the
high
table
her
husband
at
the
head
of
the
second
to
each
he
gave
a
reassuring
nod
and
went
to
her
own
seat
which
was
among
the
junior
boys
the
beef
was
being
carried
out
she
stopped
it
mr
ansell
is
coming
she
called
herbert
there
is
more
room
by
you
sit
up
straight
the
boys
sat
up
straight
and
a
respectful
hush
spread
over
the
room
here
he
is
called
rickie
cheerfully
taking
his
cue
from
his
wife
oh
this
is
splendid
ansell
came
in
i
m
so
glad
you
managed
this
i
couldn
t
leave
these
wretches
last
night
the
boys
tittered
suitably
the
atmosphere
seemed
normal
even
herbert
though
longing
to
hear
what
had
happened
to
the
blackmailer
gave
adequate
greeting
to
their
guest
come
in
ansell
come
here
take
us
as
you
find
us
i
understood
said
stewart
that
i
should
find
you
all
elliot
told
me
i
should
on
that
understanding
i
it
was
at
once
evident
that
something
had
gone
wrong
ansell
looked
round
the
room
carefully
then
clearing
his
throat
and
ruffling
his
hair
he
began
i
can
not
see
the
man
with
whom
i
have
talked
intimately
for
an
hour
in
your
the
worst
of
it
was
they
were
all
so
far
from
him
and
from
each
other
each
at
the
end
of
a
tableful
of
inquisitive
boys
the
two
masters
looked
at
agnes
for
information
for
her
reassuring
nod
had
not
told
them
much
she
looked
hopelessly
back
i
can
not
see
this
man
repeated
ansell
who
remained
by
the
harmonium
in
the
midst
of
astonished
waitresses
is
he
to
be
given
no
lunch
herbert
broke
the
silence
by
fresh
greetings
rickie
knew
that
the
contest
was
lost
and
that
his
friend
had
sided
with
the
enemy
it
was
the
kind
of
thing
he
would
do
one
must
face
the
catastrophe
quietly
and
with
dignity
perhaps
ansell
would
have
turned
on
his
heel
and
left
behind
him
only
vague
suspicions
if
elliot
had
not
tried
to
talk
him
down
man
she
cried
what
man
oh
i
know
terrible
bore
did
he
get
hold
of
you
thus
committing
their
first
blunder
and
causing
ansell
to
say
to
rickie
have
you
seen
your
brother
i
have
have
you
been
told
he
was
here
rickie
s
answer
was
inaudible
have
you
been
told
you
have
a
brother
let
us
continue
this
conversation
continue
it
my
dear
man
how
can
we
until
you
know
what
i
m
talking
about
you
must
think
me
mad
but
i
tell
you
solemnly
that
you
have
a
brother
of
whom
you
ve
never
heard
and
that
he
was
in
this
house
ten
minutes
he
paused
impressively
your
wife
has
happened
to
see
him
first
being
neither
serious
nor
truthful
she
is
keeping
you
apart
telling
him
some
lie
and
not
telling
you
a
there
was
a
murmur
of
alarm
one
of
the
prefects
rose
and
ansell
set
his
back
to
the
wall
quite
ready
for
a
battle
for
two
years
he
had
waited
for
his
opportunity
he
would
hit
out
at
elliot
like
any
ploughboy
now
that
it
had
come
rickie
said
there
is
a
slight
misunderstanding
i
like
my
wife
have
known
what
there
is
to
know
for
two
years
a
dignified
rebuff
but
their
second
blunder
exactly
said
agnes
now
i
think
ansell
had
better
go
exploded
ansell
i
ve
everything
to
say
yet
i
beg
your
pardon
elliot
i
am
concerned
with
you
no
longer
this
man
he
turned
to
the
avenue
of
faces
this
man
who
teaches
you
has
a
brother
he
has
known
of
him
two
years
and
been
ashamed
he
has
oh
oh
how
it
fits
together
rickie
it
s
you
not
silt
who
must
have
sent
tales
of
him
to
your
aunt
it
s
you
who
ve
turned
him
out
of
cadover
it
s
you
who
ve
ordered
him
to
be
ruined
now
herbert
arose
out
of
my
sight
sir
but
have
it
from
me
first
that
rickie
and
his
aunt
have
both
behaved
most
generously
no
no
agnes
i
ll
not
be
interrupted
garbled
versions
must
not
get
about
if
the
wonham
man
is
not
satisfied
now
he
must
be
insatiable
he
can
not
levy
blackmail
on
us
for
ever
sir
i
give
you
two
minutes
then
you
will
be
expelled
by
two
minutes
sang
ansell
i
can
say
a
great
deal
in
he
put
one
foot
on
a
chair
and
held
his
arms
over
the
quivering
room
he
seemed
transfigured
into
a
hebrew
prophet
passionate
for
satire
and
the
truth
oh
keep
quiet
for
two
minutes
he
cried
and
i
ll
tell
you
something
you
ll
be
glad
to
hear
you
re
a
little
afraid
stephen
may
come
back
don
t
be
afraid
i
bring
good
news
you
ll
never
see
him
nor
any
one
like
him
again
i
must
speak
very
plainly
for
you
are
all
three
fools
i
don
t
want
you
to
say
afterwards
poor
ansell
tried
to
be
generally
i
don
t
mind
but
i
should
mind
today
please
listen
stephen
is
a
bully
he
drinks
he
knocks
one
down
but
he
would
sooner
die
than
take
money
from
people
he
did
not
love
perhaps
he
will
die
for
he
has
nothing
but
a
few
pence
that
the
poor
gave
him
and
some
tobacco
which
to
my
eternal
glory
he
accepted
from
me
please
listen
again
why
did
he
come
here
because
he
thought
you
would
love
him
and
was
ready
to
love
you
but
i
tell
you
don
t
be
afraid
he
would
sooner
die
now
than
say
you
were
his
brother
please
listen
again
now
stewart
don
t
go
on
like
that
said
rickie
bitterly
it
s
easy
enough
to
preach
when
you
are
an
outsider
you
would
be
more
charitable
if
such
a
thing
had
happened
to
yourself
easy
enough
to
be
unconventional
when
you
haven
t
suffered
and
know
nothing
of
the
facts
you
love
anything
out
of
the
way
anything
queer
that
doesn
t
often
happen
and
so
you
get
excited
over
this
it
s
useless
my
dear
man
you
have
hurt
me
but
you
will
never
upset
me
as
soon
as
you
stop
this
ridiculous
scene
we
will
finish
our
dinner
spread
this
scandal
add
to
it
i
m
too
old
to
mind
such
nonsense
i
can
not
help
my
father
s
disgrace
on
the
one
hand
nor
on
the
other
will
i
have
anything
to
do
with
his
blackguard
of
a
so
the
secret
was
given
to
the
world
agnes
might
colour
at
his
speech
herbert
might
calculate
the
effect
of
it
on
the
entries
for
dunwood
house
but
he
cared
for
none
of
these
things
thank
god
he
was
withered
up
at
last
please
listen
again
resumed
ansell
please
correct
two
slight
mistakes
firstly
stephen
is
one
of
the
greatest
people
i
have
ever
met
secondly
he
s
not
your
father
s
son
he
s
the
son
of
your
it
was
rickie
not
ansell
who
was
carried
from
the
hall
and
it
was
herbert
who
pronounced
the
blessing
benedicto
a
profound
stillness
succeeded
the
storm
and
the
boys
slipping
away
from
their
meal
told
the
news
to
the
rest
of
the
school
or
put
it
in
the
letters
they
were
writing
home
xxviii
the
soul
has
her
own
currency
she
mints
her
spiritual
coinage
and
stamps
it
with
the
image
of
some
beloved
face
with
it
she
pays
her
debts
with
it
she
reckons
saying
this
man
has
worth
this
man
is
and
in
time
she
forgets
its
origin
it
seems
to
her
to
be
a
thing
unalterable
divine
but
the
soul
can
also
have
her
bankruptcies
perhaps
she
will
be
the
richer
in
the
end
in
her
agony
she
learns
to
reckon
clearly
fair
as
the
coin
may
have
been
it
was
not
accurate
and
though
she
knew
it
not
there
were
treasures
that
it
could
not
buy
the
face
however
beloved
was
mortal
and
as
liable
as
the
soul
herself
to
err
we
do
but
shift
responsibility
by
making
a
standard
of
the
dead
there
is
indeed
another
coinage
that
bears
on
it
not
man
s
image
but
god
s
it
is
incorruptible
and
the
soul
may
trust
it
safely
it
will
serve
her
beyond
the
stars
but
it
can
not
give
us
friends
or
the
embrace
of
a
lover
or
the
touch
of
children
for
with
our
fellow
mortals
it
has
no
concern
it
can
not
even
give
the
joys
we
call
trivial
fine
weather
the
pleasures
of
meat
and
drink
bathing
and
the
hot
sand
afterwards
running
dreamless
sleep
have
we
learnt
the
true
discipline
of
a
bankruptcy
if
we
turn
to
such
coinage
as
this
will
it
really
profit
us
so
much
if
we
save
our
souls
and
lose
the
whole
world
part
wiltshire
xxix
robert
there
is
no
occasion
to
mention
his
surname
he
was
a
young
farmer
of
some
education
who
tried
to
coax
the
aged
soil
of
wiltshire
scientifically
came
to
cadover
on
business
and
fell
in
love
with
elliot
she
was
there
on
her
bridal
visit
and
he
an
obscure
nobody
was
received
by
mrs
failing
into
the
house
and
treated
as
her
social
equal
he
was
in
a
bucolic
way
and
people
sometimes
mistook
him
for
a
gentleman
until
they
saw
his
hands
he
discovered
this
and
one
of
the
slow
gentle
jokes
he
played
on
society
was
to
talk
upon
some
cultured
subject
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
then
suddenly
reveal
them
do
you
go
in
for
boating
the
lady
would
ask
and
then
he
explained
that
those
particular
weals
are
made
by
the
handles
of
the
plough
upon
which
she
became
extremely
interested
but
found
an
early
opportunity
of
talking
to
some
one
else
he
played
this
joke
on
elliot
the
first
evening
not
knowing
that
she
observed
him
as
he
entered
the
room
he
walked
heavily
lifting
his
feet
as
if
the
carpet
was
furrowed
and
he
had
no
evening
clothes
every
one
tried
to
put
him
at
his
ease
but
she
rather
suspected
that
he
was
there
already
and
envied
him
they
were
introduced
and
spoke
of
byron
who
was
still
fashionable
out
came
his
hands
the
only
rough
hands
in
the
the
only
hands
that
had
ever
worked
she
was
filled
with
some
strange
approval
and
liked
him
after
dinner
they
met
again
to
speak
not
of
byron
but
of
manure
the
other
people
were
so
clever
and
so
amusing
that
it
relieved
her
to
listen
to
a
man
who
told
her
three
times
not
to
buy
artificial
manure
ready
made
but
if
she
would
use
it
to
make
it
herself
at
the
last
moment
because
the
ammonia
evaporated
here
were
two
packets
of
powder
did
they
smell
no
mix
them
together
and
pour
some
coffee
an
appalling
smell
at
once
burst
forth
and
every
one
began
to
cough
and
cry
this
was
good
for
the
earth
when
she
felt
sour
for
he
knew
when
the
earth
was
ill
he
knew
too
when
she
was
hungry
he
spoke
of
her
tantrums
the
strange
unscientific
element
in
her
that
will
baffle
the
scientist
to
the
end
of
time
study
away
elliot
he
told
her
read
all
the
books
you
can
get
hold
of
but
when
it
comes
to
the
point
stroll
out
with
a
pipe
in
your
mouth
and
do
a
bit
of
as
he
talked
the
earth
became
a
living
being
or
rather
a
being
with
a
living
skin
and
manure
no
longer
dirty
stuff
but
a
symbol
of
regeneration
and
of
the
birth
of
life
from
life
so
it
goes
on
for
ever
she
cried
excitedly
he
replied
not
for
ever
in
time
the
fire
at
the
centre
will
cool
and
nothing
can
go
on
he
advanced
into
love
with
open
eyes
slowly
heavily
just
as
he
had
advanced
across
the
drawing
room
carpet
but
this
time
the
bride
did
not
observe
his
tread
she
was
listening
to
her
husband
and
trying
not
to
be
so
stupid
when
he
was
close
to
her
so
close
that
it
was
difficult
not
to
take
her
in
his
arms
he
spoke
to
mr
failing
and
was
at
once
turned
out
of
cadover
i
m
sorry
said
mr
failing
as
he
walked
down
the
drive
with
his
hand
on
his
guest
s
shoulder
i
had
no
notion
you
were
that
sort
any
one
who
behaves
like
that
has
to
stop
at
the
any
one
any
he
sighed
heavily
not
for
any
personal
grievance
but
because
he
saw
how
unruly
how
barbaric
is
the
soul
of
man
after
all
this
man
was
more
civilized
than
most
are
you
angry
with
me
sir
he
called
him
sir
not
because
he
was
richer
or
cleverer
or
smarter
not
because
he
had
helped
to
educate
him
and
had
lent
him
money
but
for
a
reason
more
profound
for
the
reason
that
there
are
gradations
in
heaven
i
did
think
you
that
a
man
like
you
wouldn
t
risk
making
people
unhappy
my
i
don
t
say
this
to
stop
you
loving
her
something
else
must
do
that
my
as
far
as
i
know
doesn
t
care
for
you
one
little
bit
if
you
had
said
anything
if
she
had
guessed
that
a
chance
person
was
in
this
fearful
state
you
would
simply
have
opened
hell
a
woman
of
her
sort
would
have
lost
all
i
knew
mr
failing
removed
his
hand
he
was
displeased
but
something
here
said
robert
incoherently
this
he
struck
himself
heavily
on
the
heart
this
here
doing
something
so
unusual
makes
it
not
matter
what
she
loses
i
after
a
silence
he
asked
have
i
quite
followed
you
sir
in
that
business
of
the
brotherhood
of
man
how
do
you
mean
i
thought
love
was
to
bring
it
love
of
another
man
s
wife
sensual
love
you
have
understood
nothing
then
he
was
ashamed
and
cried
i
understand
nothing
for
he
remembered
that
sensual
and
spiritual
are
not
easy
words
to
use
that
there
are
perhaps
not
two
aphrodites
but
one
aphrodite
with
a
janus
face
i
only
understand
that
you
must
try
to
forget
i
will
not
promise
me
just
this
then
not
to
do
anything
i
m
straight
no
boasting
but
i
couldn
t
do
a
crooked
thing
no
not
if
i
and
so
appallingly
straight
was
he
in
after
years
that
mr
failing
wished
that
he
had
phrased
the
promise
differently
robert
simply
waited
he
told
himself
that
it
was
hopeless
but
something
deeper
than
himself
declared
that
there
was
hope
he
gave
up
drink
and
kept
himself
in
all
ways
clean
for
he
wanted
to
be
worthy
of
her
when
the
time
came
women
seemed
fond
of
him
and
caused
him
to
reflect
with
pleasure
they
do
run
after
me
there
must
be
something
in
me
good
i
d
be
done
for
if
there
wasn
for
six
years
he
turned
up
the
earth
of
wiltshire
and
read
books
for
the
sake
of
his
mind
and
talked
to
gentlemen
for
the
sake
of
their
patois
and
each
year
he
rode
to
cadover
to
take
off
his
hat
to
elliot
and
perhaps
to
speak
to
her
about
the
crops
mr
failing
was
generally
present
and
it
struck
neither
man
that
those
dull
little
visits
were
so
many
words
out
of
which
a
lonely
woman
might
build
sentences
then
robert
went
to
london
on
business
he
chanced
to
see
elliot
with
a
strange
lady
the
time
had
come
he
became
diplomatic
and
called
at
elliot
s
rooms
to
find
things
out
for
if
elliot
was
happier
than
he
could
ever
make
her
he
would
withdraw
and
love
her
in
renunciation
but
if
he
could
make
her
happier
he
would
love
her
in
fulfilment
elliot
admitted
him
as
a
friend
of
his
s
and
felt
very
as
he
did
so
robert
however
was
a
success
the
youngish
men
there
found
him
interesting
and
liked
to
shock
him
with
tales
of
naughty
london
and
naughtier
paris
they
spoke
of
experience
and
sensations
and
seeing
life
and
when
a
smile
ploughed
over
his
face
concluded
that
his
prudery
was
vanquished
he
saw
that
they
were
much
less
vicious
than
they
supposed
one
boy
had
obviously
read
his
sensations
in
a
book
but
he
could
pardon
vice
what
he
could
not
pardon
was
triviality
and
he
hoped
that
no
decent
woman
could
pardon
it
either
there
grew
up
in
him
a
cold
steady
anger
against
these
silly
people
who
thought
it
advanced
to
be
shocking
and
who
described
as
something
particularly
choice
and
educational
things
that
he
had
understood
and
fought
against
for
years
he
inquired
after
elliot
and
a
boy
tittered
it
seemed
that
she
did
not
know
that
she
lived
in
a
remote
suburb
taking
care
of
a
skinny
baby
i
shall
call
some
time
or
other
said
robert
do
said
elliot
smiling
and
next
time
he
saw
his
wife
he
congratulated
her
on
her
rustic
admirer
she
had
suffered
terribly
she
had
asked
for
bread
and
had
been
given
not
even
a
stone
people
talk
of
hungering
for
the
ideal
but
there
is
another
hunger
quite
as
divine
for
facts
she
had
asked
for
facts
and
had
been
given
views
emotional
standpoints
attitudes
towards
to
a
woman
who
believed
that
facts
are
beautiful
that
the
living
world
is
beautiful
beyond
the
laws
of
beauty
that
manure
is
neither
gross
nor
ludicrous
that
a
fire
not
eternal
glows
at
the
heart
of
the
earth
it
was
intolerable
to
be
put
off
with
what
the
elliots
called
philosophy
and
if
she
refused
to
be
told
that
she
had
no
sense
of
humour
tarrying
into
the
elliot
it
had
sounded
so
splendid
for
she
was
a
penniless
child
with
nothing
to
offer
and
the
elliots
held
their
heads
high
for
what
reason
what
had
they
ever
done
except
say
sarcastic
things
and
limp
and
be
refined
mr
failing
suffered
too
but
she
suffered
more
inasmuch
as
frederick
was
more
impossible
than
emily
he
did
not
like
her
he
practically
lived
apart
he
was
not
even
faithful
or
polite
these
were
grave
faults
but
they
were
human
ones
she
could
even
imagine
them
in
a
man
she
loved
what
she
could
never
love
was
a
dilettante
robert
brought
her
an
armful
of
he
laid
it
on
the
table
put
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
kept
them
there
till
the
end
of
the
visit
she
knew
quite
well
why
he
had
come
and
though
she
also
knew
that
he
would
fail
she
loved
him
too
much
to
snub
him
or
to
stare
in
virtuous
indignation
why
have
you
come
she
asked
gravely
and
why
have
you
brought
me
so
many
flowers
my
garden
is
full
of
them
he
answered
sweetpeas
need
picking
down
and
generally
speaking
flowers
are
plentiful
in
she
broke
his
present
into
bunches
so
much
for
the
so
much
for
the
nursery
so
much
for
the
kitchen
and
her
husband
s
room
he
would
be
down
for
the
night
the
most
beautiful
she
would
keep
for
herself
presently
he
said
your
husband
is
no
good
i
ve
watched
him
for
a
week
i
m
thirty
and
not
what
you
call
hasty
as
i
used
to
be
or
thinking
that
nothing
matters
like
the
french
no
i
m
a
plain
britisher
yet
i
i
ve
begun
wrong
end
elliot
i
should
have
said
that
i
ve
thought
chiefly
of
you
for
six
years
and
that
though
i
talk
here
so
respectfully
if
i
once
unhooked
my
hands
there
was
a
pause
then
she
said
with
great
sweetness
thank
you
i
am
glad
you
love
me
and
rang
the
bell
what
have
you
done
that
for
he
cried
because
you
must
now
leave
the
house
and
never
enter
it
i
don
t
go
alone
and
he
began
to
get
furious
her
voice
was
still
sweet
but
strength
lay
in
it
too
as
she
said
you
either
go
now
with
my
thanks
and
blessing
or
else
you
go
with
the
police
i
am
elliot
we
need
not
discuss
elliot
i
am
elliot
and
if
you
make
one
step
towards
me
i
give
you
in
but
the
maid
answered
the
bell
not
of
the
but
of
the
front
door
they
were
joined
by
elliot
who
held
out
his
hand
with
much
urbanity
it
was
not
taken
he
looked
quickly
at
his
wife
and
said
am
i
de
trop
there
was
a
long
silence
at
last
she
said
frederick
turn
this
man
my
love
why
robert
said
that
he
loved
her
then
i
am
de
trop
said
elliot
smoothing
out
his
gloves
he
would
give
these
sodden
barbarians
a
lesson
my
hansom
is
waiting
at
the
door
pray
make
use
of
don
t
she
cried
almost
affectionately
dear
frederick
it
isn
t
a
play
just
tell
this
man
to
go
or
send
for
the
on
the
contrary
it
is
french
comedy
of
the
best
type
don
t
you
agree
sir
that
the
police
would
be
an
inartistic
error
he
was
perfectly
calm
and
collected
whereas
they
were
in
a
pitiable
state
turn
him
out
at
once
she
cried
he
has
insulted
your
wife
save
me
save
me
she
clung
to
her
husband
and
wept
he
was
going
i
had
managed
him
he
would
never
have
known
elliot
repulsed
her
if
you
don
t
feel
inclined
to
start
at
once
he
said
with
easy
civility
let
us
have
a
little
tea
my
dear
sir
do
forgive
me
for
not
shooting
you
nous
avons
change
tout
cela
please
don
t
look
so
nervous
please
do
unclasp
your
hands
he
was
alone
that
s
all
right
he
exclaimed
and
strolled
to
the
door
the
hansom
was
disappearing
round
the
corner
that
s
all
right
he
repeated
in
more
quavering
tones
as
he
returned
to
the
and
saw
that
it
was
littered
with
their
colour
got
on
his
nerves
magenta
crimson
magenta
crimson
he
tried
to
pick
them
up
and
they
escaped
he
trod
them
underfoot
and
they
multiplied
and
danced
in
the
triumph
of
summer
like
a
thousand
butterflies
the
train
had
left
when
he
got
to
the
station
he
followed
on
to
london
and
there
he
lost
all
traces
at
midnight
he
began
to
realize
that
his
wife
could
never
belong
to
him
again
mr
failing
had
a
letter
from
stockholm
it
was
never
known
what
impulse
sent
them
there
i
am
sorry
about
it
all
but
it
was
the
only
the
letter
censured
the
law
of
england
which
obliges
us
to
behave
like
this
or
else
we
should
never
get
married
i
shall
come
back
to
face
things
she
will
not
come
back
till
she
is
my
wife
he
must
bring
an
action
soon
or
else
we
shall
try
one
against
him
it
seems
all
very
unconventional
but
it
is
not
really
it
is
only
a
difficult
start
we
are
not
like
you
or
your
wife
we
want
to
be
just
ordinary
people
and
make
the
farm
pay
and
not
be
noticed
all
our
and
they
were
capable
of
living
as
they
wanted
the
class
difference
which
so
intrigued
mrs
failing
meant
very
little
to
them
it
was
there
but
so
were
other
things
they
both
cared
for
work
and
living
in
the
open
and
for
not
speaking
unless
they
had
got
something
to
say
their
love
of
beauty
like
their
love
for
each
other
was
not
dependent
on
detail
it
grew
not
from
the
nerves
but
from
the
soul
i
believe
a
leaf
of
grass
is
no
less
than
the
journey
work
of
the
stars
and
the
pismire
is
equally
perfect
and
a
grain
of
sand
and
the
egg
of
the
wren
and
the
tree
toad
is
a
oeuvre
for
the
highest
and
the
running
blackberry
would
adorn
the
parlours
of
they
had
never
read
these
lines
and
would
have
thought
them
nonsense
if
they
had
they
did
not
dissect
indeed
they
could
not
but
she
at
all
events
divined
that
more
than
perfect
health
and
perfect
weather
more
than
personal
love
had
gone
to
the
making
of
those
seventeen
days
ordinary
people
cried
mrs
failing
on
hearing
the
letter
at
that
time
she
was
young
and
daring
why
they
re
divine
they
re
forces
of
nature
they
re
as
ordinary
as
volcanoes
we
all
knew
my
brother
was
disgusting
and
wanted
him
to
be
blown
to
pieces
but
we
never
thought
it
would
happen
do
look
at
the
thing
bravely
and
say
as
i
do
that
they
are
guiltless
in
the
sight
of
i
think
they
are
replied
her
husband
but
they
are
not
guiltless
in
the
sight
of
you
conventional
she
exclaimed
in
disgust
what
they
have
done
means
misery
not
only
for
themselves
but
for
others
for
your
brother
though
you
will
not
think
of
him
for
the
little
boy
did
you
think
of
him
and
perhaps
for
another
child
who
will
have
the
whole
world
against
him
if
it
knows
they
have
sinned
against
society
and
you
do
not
diminish
the
misery
by
proving
that
society
is
bad
or
foolish
it
is
the
saddest
truth
i
have
yet
perceived
that
the
beloved
republic
here
she
took
up
a
book
of
which
swinburne
speaks
she
put
the
book
down
will
not
be
brought
about
by
love
alone
it
will
approach
with
no
flourish
of
trumpets
and
have
no
declaration
of
independence
and
worse
still
are
the
things
that
sometimes
help
it
most
and
that
is
why
we
should
start
for
stockholm
this
he
waited
for
her
indignation
to
subside
and
then
continued
i
don
t
know
whether
it
can
be
hushed
up
i
don
t
yet
know
whether
it
ought
to
be
hushed
up
but
we
ought
to
provide
the
opportunity
there
is
no
scandal
yet
if
we
go
it
is
just
possible
there
never
will
be
any
we
must
talk
over
the
whole
thing
and
and
lie
interrupted
mrs
failing
who
hated
travel
and
see
how
to
avoid
the
greatest
there
was
to
be
no
scandal
by
the
time
they
arrived
robert
had
been
drowned
elliot
described
how
they
had
gone
swimming
and
how
since
he
always
lived
inland
the
great
waves
had
tired
him
they
had
raced
for
the
open
sea
what
are
your
plans
he
asked
i
bring
you
a
message
from
i
heard
him
call
she
continued
but
i
thought
he
was
laughing
when
i
turned
it
was
too
late
he
put
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
sank
for
he
would
only
have
drowned
me
with
him
i
should
have
done
the
mrs
failing
was
thrilled
and
kissed
her
but
mr
failing
knew
that
life
does
not
continue
heroic
for
long
and
he
gave
her
the
message
from
her
husband
would
she
come
back
to
him
to
his
intense
astonishment
at
first
to
his
regret
she
replied
i
will
think
about
it
if
i
loved
him
the
very
least
bit
i
should
say
no
if
i
had
anything
to
do
with
my
life
i
should
say
no
but
it
is
simply
a
question
of
beating
time
till
i
die
nothing
that
is
coming
matters
i
may
as
well
sit
in
his
and
dust
his
furniture
since
he
has
suggested
and
elliot
though
he
made
certain
stipulations
was
positively
glad
to
see
her
people
had
begun
to
laugh
at
him
and
to
say
that
his
wife
had
run
away
she
had
not
she
had
been
with
his
sister
in
sweden
in
a
half
miraculous
way
the
matter
was
hushed
up
even
the
silts
only
scented
something
when
stephen
was
born
it
was
abroad
when
he
came
to
england
it
was
as
the
child
of
a
friend
of
failing
s
elliot
returned
unsuspected
to
her
husband
but
though
things
can
be
hushed
up
there
is
no
such
thing
as
beating
time
and
as
the
years
passed
she
realized
her
terrible
mistake
when
her
lover
sank
eluding
her
last
embrace
she
thought
as
agnes
was
to
think
after
her
that
her
soul
had
sunk
with
him
and
that
never
again
should
she
be
capable
of
earthly
love
nothing
mattered
she
might
as
well
go
and
be
useful
to
her
husband
and
to
the
little
boy
who
looked
exactly
like
him
and
who
she
thought
was
exactly
like
him
in
disposition
then
stephen
was
born
and
altered
her
life
she
could
still
love
people
passionately
she
still
drew
strength
from
the
heroic
past
yet
to
keep
to
her
bond
she
must
see
this
son
only
as
a
stranger
she
was
protected
be
the
conventions
and
must
pay
them
their
fee
and
a
curious
thing
happened
her
second
child
drew
her
towards
her
first
she
began
to
love
rickie
also
and
to
be
more
than
useful
to
him
and
as
her
love
revived
so
did
her
capacity
for
suffering
life
more
important
grew
more
bitter
she
minded
her
husband
more
not
less
and
when
at
last
he
died
and
she
saw
a
glorious
autumn
beautiful
with
the
voices
of
boys
who
should
call
her
mother
the
end
came
for
her
as
well
before
she
could
remember
the
grave
in
the
alien
north
and
the
dust
that
would
never
return
to
the
dear
fields
that
had
given
it
xxx
stephen
the
son
of
these
people
had
one
instinct
that
troubled
him
at
night
especially
out
of
doors
it
seemed
rather
strange
that
he
was
alive
the
dry
grass
pricked
his
cheek
the
fields
were
invisible
and
mute
and
here
was
he
throwing
stones
at
the
darkness
or
smoking
a
pipe
the
stones
vanished
the
pipe
would
burn
out
but
he
would
be
here
in
the
morning
when
the
sun
rose
and
he
would
bathe
and
run
in
the
mist
he
was
proud
of
his
good
circulation
and
in
the
morning
it
seemed
quite
natural
but
at
night
why
should
there
be
this
difference
between
him
and
the
acres
of
land
that
cooled
all
round
him
until
the
sun
returned
what
lucky
chance
had
heated
him
up
and
sent
him
warm
and
lovable
into
a
passive
world
he
had
other
instincts
but
these
gave
him
no
trouble
he
simply
gratified
each
as
it
occurred
provided
he
could
do
so
without
grave
injury
to
his
fellows
but
the
instinct
to
wonder
at
the
night
was
not
to
be
thus
appeased
at
first
he
had
lived
under
the
care
of
mr
failing
the
only
person
to
whom
his
mother
spoke
freely
the
only
person
who
had
treated
her
neither
as
a
criminal
nor
as
a
pioneer
in
their
rare
but
intimate
conversations
she
had
asked
him
to
educate
her
son
i
will
teach
him
latin
he
answered
the
rest
such
a
boy
must
latin
at
all
events
was
a
failure
who
could
attend
to
virgil
when
the
sound
of
the
thresher
arose
and
you
knew
that
the
stack
was
decreasing
and
that
rats
rushed
more
plentifully
each
moment
to
their
doom
but
he
was
fond
of
mr
failing
and
cried
when
he
died
elliot
a
pleasant
woman
died
soon
after
there
was
something
fatal
in
the
order
of
these
deaths
mr
failing
had
made
no
provision
for
the
boy
in
his
will
his
wife
had
promised
to
see
to
this
then
came
elliot
s
death
and
before
the
new
home
was
created
the
sudden
death
of
elliot
she
also
left
stephen
no
money
she
had
none
to
leave
chance
threw
him
into
the
power
of
mrs
failing
let
things
go
on
as
they
are
she
thought
i
will
take
care
of
this
pretty
little
boy
and
the
ugly
little
boy
can
live
with
the
silts
after
my
death
well
the
papers
will
be
found
after
my
death
and
they
can
meet
then
i
like
the
idea
of
their
mutual
ignorance
it
is
he
was
then
twelve
with
a
few
brief
intervals
of
school
he
lived
in
wiltshire
until
he
was
driven
out
life
had
two
distinct
sides
the
and
the
other
in
the
people
talked
a
good
deal
laughing
as
they
talked
being
clever
they
did
not
care
for
animals
one
man
had
never
seen
a
hedgehog
in
the
other
life
people
talked
and
laughed
separately
or
even
did
neither
on
the
whole
in
spite
of
the
wet
and
gamekeepers
this
life
was
preferable
he
knew
where
he
was
he
glanced
at
the
boy
or
later
at
the
man
and
behaved
accordingly
there
was
no
law
the
policeman
was
negligible
nothing
bound
him
but
his
own
word
and
he
gave
that
sparingly
it
is
impossible
to
be
romantic
when
you
have
your
heart
s
desire
and
such
a
boy
disappointed
mrs
failing
greatly
his
parents
had
met
for
one
brief
embrace
had
found
one
little
interval
between
the
power
of
the
rulers
of
this
world
and
the
power
of
death
he
was
the
child
of
poetry
and
of
rebellion
and
poetry
should
run
in
his
veins
but
he
lived
too
near
the
things
he
loved
to
seem
poetical
parted
from
them
he
might
yet
satisfy
her
and
stretch
out
his
hands
with
a
pagan
s
yearning
as
it
was
he
only
rode
her
horses
and
trespassed
and
bathed
and
worked
for
no
obvious
reason
upon
her
fields
affection
she
did
not
believe
in
and
made
no
attempt
to
mould
him
and
he
for
his
part
was
very
content
to
harden
untouched
into
a
man
his
parents
had
given
him
excellent
gifts
health
sturdy
limbs
and
a
face
not
ugly
gifts
that
his
habits
confirmed
they
had
also
given
him
a
cloudless
spirit
the
spirit
of
the
seventeen
days
in
which
he
was
created
but
they
had
not
given
him
the
spirit
of
their
sit
years
of
waiting
and
love
for
one
person
was
never
to
be
the
greatest
thing
he
knew
philosophy
had
postponed
the
quarrel
between
them
incurious
about
his
personal
origin
he
had
a
certain
interest
in
our
eternal
problems
the
interest
never
became
a
passion
it
sprang
out
of
his
physical
growth
and
was
soon
merged
in
it
again
or
as
he
put
it
himself
i
must
get
fixed
up
before
he
was
soon
fixed
up
as
a
materialist
then
he
tore
up
the
sixpenny
reprints
and
never
amused
mrs
failing
so
much
again
about
the
time
he
fixed
himself
up
he
took
to
drink
he
knew
of
no
reason
against
it
the
instinct
was
in
him
and
it
hurt
nobody
here
as
elsewhere
his
motions
were
decided
and
he
passed
at
once
from
roaring
jollity
to
silence
for
those
who
live
on
the
fuddled
borderland
who
crawl
home
by
the
railings
and
maunder
repentance
in
the
morning
he
had
a
biting
contempt
a
man
must
take
his
tumble
and
his
headache
he
was
in
fact
as
little
disgusting
as
is
conceivable
and
hitherto
he
had
not
strained
his
constitution
or
his
will
nor
did
he
get
drunk
as
often
as
agnes
suggested
the
real
quarrel
gathered
elsewhere
presentable
people
have
run
wild
in
their
youth
but
the
hour
comes
when
they
turn
from
their
boorish
company
to
higher
things
this
hour
never
came
for
stephen
somewhat
a
bully
by
nature
he
kept
where
his
powers
would
tell
and
continued
to
quarrel
and
play
with
the
men
he
had
known
as
boys
he
prolonged
their
youth
unduly
they
won
t
settle
down
said
wilbraham
to
his
wife
they
re
wanting
things
it
s
the
germ
of
a
trades
union
i
shall
get
rid
of
a
few
of
the
then
stephen
rushed
up
to
mrs
failing
and
worried
her
it
wasn
t
fair
was
a
good
sort
he
did
his
work
keen
about
it
no
why
should
he
be
why
should
he
be
keen
about
somebody
else
s
land
but
keen
enough
and
very
keen
on
she
laughed
and
said
a
word
about
to
wilbraham
wilbraham
blazed
up
how
could
the
farm
go
on
without
discipline
how
could
there
be
discipline
if
stephen
interfered
stephen
liked
power
he
spoke
to
the
men
like
one
of
themselves
and
pretended
it
was
all
equality
but
he
took
care
to
come
out
top
natural
of
course
that
being
a
gentleman
he
should
but
not
natural
for
a
gentleman
to
loiter
all
day
with
poor
people
and
learn
their
work
and
put
wrong
notions
into
their
heads
and
carry
their
newfangled
grievances
to
mrs
failing
which
partly
accounted
for
the
deficit
on
the
past
she
rebuked
stephen
then
he
lost
his
temper
was
rude
to
her
and
insulted
wilbraham
the
worst
days
of
failing
s
rule
seemed
to
be
returning
and
stephen
had
a
practical
experience
and
also
a
taste
for
battle
that
her
husband
had
never
possessed
he
drew
up
a
list
of
grievances
some
absurd
others
fundamental
no
newspapers
in
the
you
could
put
a
plate
under
the
thompsons
door
no
level
no
allotments
and
no
time
to
work
in
them
wilbraham
s
underpaid
aren
t
you
a
little
unwise
she
asked
coldly
i
am
more
bored
than
you
think
over
the
she
was
wanting
to
correct
the
proofs
of
the
book
and
rewrite
the
prefatory
memoir
in
her
irritation
she
wrote
to
agnes
agnes
replied
sympathetically
and
mrs
failing
clever
as
she
was
fell
into
the
power
of
the
younger
woman
they
discussed
him
at
first
as
a
wretch
of
a
boy
then
he
got
drunk
and
somehow
it
seemed
more
criminal
all
that
she
needed
now
was
a
personal
grievance
which
agnes
casually
supplied
though
vindictive
she
was
determined
to
treat
him
well
and
thought
with
satisfaction
of
our
distant
colonies
but
he
burst
into
an
odd
passion
he
would
sooner
starve
than
leave
england
why
she
asked
are
you
in
love
he
picked
up
a
lump
of
the
were
by
the
arbour
and
made
no
answer
the
vicar
murmured
it
is
not
like
going
abroad
greater
britain
blood
is
thicker
than
water
a
lump
of
chalk
broke
her
window
on
the
saturday
thus
stephen
left
wiltshire
do
not
brand
him
as
a
socialist
he
had
no
quarrel
with
society
nor
any
particular
belief
in
people
because
they
are
poor
he
only
held
the
creed
of
here
am
i
and
there
are
you
and
therefore
class
distinctions
were
trivial
things
to
him
and
life
no
decorous
scheme
but
a
personal
combat
or
a
personal
truce
for
the
same
reason
ancestry
also
was
trivial
and
a
man
not
the
dearer
because
the
same
woman
was
mother
to
them
both
yet
it
seemed
worth
while
to
go
to
sawston
with
the
news
perhaps
nothing
would
come
of
it
perhaps
friendly
intercourse
and
a
home
while
he
looked
around
when
they
wronged
him
he
walked
quietly
away
he
never
thought
of
allotting
the
blame
nor
or
appealing
to
ansell
who
still
sat
brooding
in
the
he
only
knew
that
educated
people
could
be
horrible
and
that
a
clean
liver
must
never
enter
dunwood
house
again
the
air
seemed
stuffy
he
spat
in
the
gutter
was
it
yesterday
he
had
lain
in
the
over
salisbury
slightly
aggrieved
he
wondered
why
he
was
not
back
there
now
i
ought
to
have
written
first
he
reflected
here
is
my
money
gone
i
can
not
move
the
elliots
have
as
it
were
practically
robbed
that
was
the
only
grudge
he
retained
against
them
their
suspicions
and
insults
were
to
him
as
the
curses
of
a
tramp
whom
he
passed
by
the
wayside
they
were
dirty
people
not
his
sort
he
summed
up
the
complicated
tragedy
as
a
take
while
rickie
was
being
carried
upstairs
and
while
ansell
had
he
known
it
was
dashing
about
the
streets
for
him
he
lay
under
a
railway
arch
trying
to
settle
his
plans
he
must
pay
back
the
friends
who
had
given
him
shillings
and
clothes
he
thought
of
flea
whose
sundays
he
was
spoiling
poor
flea
who
ought
to
be
in
them
now
shining
before
his
girl
i
daresay
he
ll
be
ashamed
and
not
go
to
see
her
and
then
she
ll
take
the
other
he
was
also
very
hungry
that
worm
elliot
would
be
through
her
lunch
by
now
trying
his
braces
round
him
and
tearing
up
those
old
wet
documents
he
stepped
forth
to
make
money
a
villainous
young
brute
he
looked
his
clothes
were
dirty
and
he
had
lost
the
spring
of
the
morning
touching
the
walls
frowning
talking
to
himself
at
times
he
slouched
disconsolately
northwards
no
wonder
that
some
tawdry
girls
screamed
at
him
or
that
matrons
averted
their
eyes
as
they
hurried
to
afternoon
church
he
wandered
from
one
suburb
to
another
till
he
was
among
people
more
villainous
than
himself
who
bought
his
tobacco
from
him
and
sold
him
food
again
the
neighbourhood
went
up
and
families
instead
of
sitting
on
their
doorsteps
would
sit
behind
thick
muslin
curtains
again
it
would
go
down
into
a
more
avowed
despair
far
into
the
night
he
wandered
until
he
came
to
a
solemn
river
majestic
as
a
stream
in
hell
therein
were
gathered
the
waters
of
central
england
those
that
flow
off
hindhead
off
the
chilterns
off
wiltshire
north
of
the
plain
therein
they
were
made
intolerable
ere
they
reached
the
sea
but
the
waters
he
had
known
escaped
their
course
lay
southward
into
the
avon
by
forests
and
beautiful
fields
even
swift
even
pure
until
they
mirrored
the
tower
of
christchurch
and
greeted
the
ramparts
of
the
isle
of
wight
of
these
he
thought
for
a
moment
as
he
crossed
the
black
river
and
entered
the
heart
of
the
modern
world
here
he
found
employment
he
was
not
hampered
by
genteel
traditions
and
as
it
was
near
managed
to
get
taken
on
at
a
furniture
warehouse
he
moved
people
from
the
suburbs
to
london
from
london
to
the
suburbs
from
one
suburb
to
another
his
companions
were
hurried
and
querulous
in
particular
he
loathed
the
foreman
a
pious
humbug
who
allowed
no
swearing
but
indulged
in
something
far
more
degraded
the
cockney
repartee
the
london
intellect
so
pert
and
shallow
like
a
stream
that
never
reaches
the
ocean
disgusted
him
almost
as
much
as
the
london
physique
which
for
all
its
dexterity
is
not
permanent
and
seldom
continues
into
the
third
generation
his
father
had
he
known
it
had
felt
the
same
for
between
elliot
and
the
foreman
the
gulf
was
social
not
spiritual
both
spent
their
lives
in
trying
to
be
clever
and
tony
failing
had
once
put
the
thing
into
words
there
s
no
such
thing
as
a
londoner
he
s
only
a
country
man
on
the
road
to
at
the
end
of
ten
days
he
had
saved
scarcely
anything
once
he
passed
the
bank
where
a
hundred
pounds
lay
ready
for
him
but
it
was
still
inconvenient
for
him
to
take
them
then
duty
sent
him
to
a
suburb
not
very
far
from
sawston
in
the
evening
a
man
who
was
driving
a
trap
asked
him
to
hold
it
and
by
mistake
tipped
him
a
sovereign
stephen
called
after
him
but
the
man
had
a
woman
with
him
and
wanted
to
show
off
and
though
he
had
meant
to
tip
a
shilling
and
could
not
afford
that
he
shouted
back
that
his
sovereign
was
as
good
as
any
one
s
and
that
if
stephen
did
not
think
so
he
could
do
various
things
and
go
to
various
places
on
the
action
of
this
man
much
depends
stephen
changed
the
sovereign
into
a
postal
order
and
sent
it
off
to
the
people
at
cadford
it
did
not
pay
them
back
but
it
paid
them
something
and
he
felt
that
his
soul
was
free
a
few
shillings
remained
in
his
pocket
they
would
have
paid
his
fare
towards
wiltshire
a
good
county
but
what
should
he
do
there
who
would
employ
him
today
the
journey
did
not
seem
worth
while
tomorrow
perhaps
he
thought
and
determined
to
spend
the
money
on
pleasure
of
another
kind
went
for
a
ride
on
an
electric
tram
from
the
top
he
saw
the
sun
descend
a
disc
with
a
dark
red
edge
the
same
sun
was
descending
over
salisbury
intolerably
bright
out
of
the
golden
haze
the
spire
would
be
piercing
like
a
purple
needle
then
mists
arose
from
the
avon
and
the
other
streams
lamps
flickered
but
in
the
outer
purity
the
villages
were
already
slumbering
salisbury
is
only
a
gothic
upstart
beside
these
for
generations
they
have
come
down
to
her
to
buy
or
to
worship
and
have
found
in
her
the
reasonable
crisis
of
their
lives
but
generations
before
she
was
built
they
were
clinging
to
the
soil
and
renewing
it
with
sheep
and
dogs
and
men
who
found
the
crisis
of
their
lives
upon
stonehenge
the
blood
of
these
men
ran
in
stephen
the
vigour
they
had
won
for
him
was
as
yet
untarnished
out
on
those
downs
they
had
united
with
rough
women
to
make
the
thing
he
spoke
of
as
himself
the
last
of
them
has
rescued
a
woman
of
a
different
kind
from
streets
and
houses
such
as
these
as
the
sun
descended
he
got
off
the
tram
with
a
smile
of
expectation
a
lay
opposite
and
a
boy
in
a
dirty
uniform
was
already
lighting
its
enormous
lamp
his
lips
parted
and
he
went
in
two
hours
later
when
rickie
and
herbert
were
going
the
rounds
a
brick
came
crashing
at
the
study
window
herbert
peered
into
the
garden
and
a
hooligan
slipped
by
him
into
the
house
wrecked
the
hall
lurched
up
the
stairs
fell
against
the
banisters
balanced
for
a
moment
on
his
spine
and
slid
over
herbert
called
for
the
police
rickie
who
was
upon
the
landing
caught
the
man
by
the
knees
and
saved
his
life
what
is
it
cried
agnes
emerging
it
s
stephen
come
back
was
the
answer
hullo
stephen
xxxi
hither
had
rickie
moved
in
ten
days
from
disgust
to
penitence
from
penitence
to
longing
from
a
life
of
horror
to
a
new
life
in
which
he
still
surprised
himself
by
unexpected
words
hullo
stephen
for
the
son
of
his
mother
had
come
back
to
forgive
him
as
she
would
have
done
to
live
with
him
as
she
had
planned
he
s
drunk
this
time
said
agnes
wearily
she
too
had
altered
the
scandal
was
ageing
her
and
ansell
came
to
the
house
daily
hullo
stephen
but
stephen
was
now
insensible
stephen
you
live
here
good
gracious
me
interposed
herbert
my
advice
is
that
we
all
go
to
bed
the
less
said
the
better
while
our
nerves
are
in
this
state
very
well
rickie
of
course
wonham
sleeps
the
night
if
you
they
carried
the
drunken
mass
into
the
spare
room
a
mass
of
scandal
it
seemed
to
one
of
them
a
symbol
of
redemption
to
the
other
neither
acknowledged
it
a
man
who
would
answer
them
back
after
a
few
hours
rest
ansell
thought
he
would
never
forgive
me
said
rickie
for
once
he
s
come
to
bed
now
i
and
as
rickie
laid
his
hand
on
the
sleeper
s
hair
he
added
you
won
t
do
anything
foolish
will
you
you
are
still
in
a
morbid
state
your
poor
mother
pardon
me
dear
boy
it
is
my
turn
to
speak
out
you
thought
it
was
your
father
and
minded
it
is
your
mother
surely
you
ought
to
mind
more
i
have
been
too
far
back
said
rickie
gently
ansell
took
me
on
a
journey
that
was
even
new
to
him
we
got
behind
right
and
wrong
to
a
place
where
only
one
thing
matters
that
the
beloved
should
rise
from
the
but
you
won
t
do
anything
rash
why
should
i
remember
poor
agnes
he
stammered
i
i
am
the
first
to
acknowledge
that
we
might
have
pursued
a
different
policy
but
we
are
committed
to
it
now
it
makes
no
difference
whose
son
he
is
i
mean
he
is
the
same
person
you
and
i
and
my
sister
stand
or
fall
together
it
was
our
agreement
from
the
first
i
hope
no
more
of
these
distressing
scenes
with
her
there
s
a
dear
fellow
i
assure
you
they
make
my
heart
things
will
quiet
down
to
bed
now
i
insist
upon
that
very
well
said
rickie
and
when
they
were
in
the
passage
locked
the
door
from
the
outside
we
want
no
more
muddles
he
explained
pembroke
was
left
examining
the
hall
the
bust
of
hermes
was
broken
so
was
the
pot
of
the
palm
he
could
not
go
to
bed
without
once
more
sounding
rickie
you
ll
do
nothing
rash
he
called
the
notion
of
him
living
here
was
of
course
a
passing
impulse
we
three
have
adopted
a
common
now
you
go
away
called
a
voice
that
was
almost
flippant
i
never
did
belong
to
that
great
sect
whose
doctrine
is
that
each
one
should
select
at
least
i
m
not
going
to
belong
to
it
any
longer
go
away
to
a
good
night
s
rest
is
what
you
need
threatened
herbert
and
retired
not
to
find
one
for
himself
but
rickie
slept
the
guilt
of
months
and
the
remorse
of
the
last
ten
days
had
alike
departed
he
had
thought
that
his
life
was
poisoned
and
lo
it
was
purified
he
had
cursed
his
mother
and
ansell
had
replied
you
may
be
right
but
you
stand
too
near
to
settle
step
backwards
pretend
that
it
happened
to
me
do
you
want
me
to
curse
my
mother
now
step
forward
and
see
whether
anything
has
something
had
changed
he
had
journeyed
as
on
rare
occasions
a
man
must
till
he
stood
behind
right
and
wrong
on
the
banks
of
the
grey
torrent
of
life
love
is
the
only
flower
a
little
way
up
the
stream
and
a
little
way
down
had
rickie
glanced
and
he
knew
that
she
whom
he
loved
had
risen
from
the
dead
and
might
rise
again
come
away
let
them
die
out
let
them
die
surely
that
dream
was
a
vision
also
he
hurried
to
the
window
to
remember
with
a
smile
that
orion
is
not
among
the
stars
of
june
let
me
die
out
she
will
continue
he
murmured
and
in
making
plans
for
stephen
s
happiness
fell
asleep
next
morning
after
breakfast
he
announced
that
his
brother
must
live
at
dunwood
house
they
were
awed
by
the
very
moderation
of
his
tone
there
s
nothing
else
to
be
done
cadover
s
hopeless
and
a
boy
of
those
tendencies
can
t
go
drifting
there
is
also
the
question
of
a
profession
for
him
and
his
we
have
to
thank
ansell
for
this
was
all
that
agnes
could
say
and
i
foresee
disaster
was
the
contribution
of
herbert
there
s
plenty
of
money
about
rickie
continued
quite
a
man
too
much
it
has
been
one
of
our
absurdities
don
t
look
so
sad
herbert
i
m
sorry
for
you
people
but
he
s
sure
to
let
us
down
for
his
experience
of
drunkards
and
of
stephen
was
small
he
supposed
that
he
had
come
without
malice
to
renew
the
offer
of
ten
days
ago
it
is
the
end
of
dunwood
rickie
nodded
and
hoped
not
agnes
who
was
not
looking
well
began
to
cry
oh
it
is
too
bad
she
complained
when
i
ve
saved
you
from
him
all
these
but
he
could
not
pity
her
nor
even
sympathize
with
her
wounded
delicacy
the
time
for
such
nonsense
was
over
he
would
take
his
share
of
the
blame
it
was
cant
to
assume
it
all
perhaps
he
was
he
did
not
realize
how
large
his
share
was
nor
how
his
very
virtues
were
to
blame
for
her
deterioration
if
i
had
a
girl
i
d
keep
her
in
line
is
not
the
remark
of
a
fool
nor
of
a
cad
rickie
had
not
kept
his
wife
in
line
he
had
shown
her
all
the
workings
of
his
soul
mistaking
this
for
love
and
in
consequence
she
was
the
worse
woman
after
two
years
of
marriage
and
he
on
this
morning
of
freedom
was
harder
upon
her
than
he
need
have
been
the
spare
room
bell
rang
herbert
had
a
painful
struggle
between
curiosity
and
duty
for
the
bell
for
chapel
was
ringing
also
and
he
must
go
through
the
drizzle
to
school
he
promised
to
come
up
in
the
interval
rickie
who
had
rapped
his
head
that
sunday
on
the
edge
of
the
table
was
still
forbidden
to
work
before
him
a
quiet
morning
lay
secure
of
his
victory
he
took
the
portrait
of
their
mother
in
his
hand
and
walked
leisurely
upstairs
the
bell
continued
to
ring
see
about
his
breakfast
he
called
to
agnes
who
replied
very
the
handle
of
the
spare
room
door
was
moving
slowly
i
m
coming
he
cried
the
handle
was
still
he
unlocked
and
entered
his
heart
full
of
charity
but
within
stood
a
man
who
probably
owned
the
world
rickie
scarcely
knew
him
last
night
he
had
seemed
so
colorless
no
negligible
in
a
few
hours
he
had
recaptured
motion
and
passion
and
the
imprint
of
the
sunlight
and
the
wind
he
stood
not
consciously
heroic
with
arms
that
dangled
from
broad
stooping
shoulders
and
feet
that
played
with
a
hassock
on
the
carpet
but
his
hair
was
beautiful
against
the
grey
sky
and
his
eyes
recalling
the
sky
unclouded
shot
past
the
intruder
as
if
to
some
worthier
vision
so
intent
was
their
gaze
that
rickie
himself
glanced
backwards
only
to
see
the
neat
passage
and
the
banisters
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
then
the
lips
beat
together
twice
and
out
burst
a
torrent
of
amazing
words
add
it
all
up
and
let
me
know
how
much
i
d
sooner
have
died
it
never
took
me
that
way
before
i
must
have
broken
pounds
worth
if
you
ll
not
tell
the
police
i
promise
you
shan
t
lose
elliot
i
swear
but
it
may
be
months
before
i
send
it
everything
is
to
be
new
you
ve
not
to
be
a
penny
out
of
pocket
do
you
see
do
let
me
go
this
once
what
s
the
trouble
asked
rickie
as
if
they
had
been
friends
for
years
my
dear
man
we
ve
other
things
to
talk
about
gracious
me
what
a
fuss
if
you
d
smashed
the
whole
house
i
wouldn
t
mind
so
long
as
you
came
i
d
sooner
have
died
gulped
stephen
you
did
nearly
it
was
i
who
caught
you
never
mind
yesterday
s
rag
what
can
you
manage
for
breakfast
the
face
grew
more
angry
and
more
puzzled
yesterday
wasn
t
a
rag
he
said
without
focusing
his
eyes
i
was
drunk
but
naturally
meant
meant
what
to
smash
you
bad
liquor
did
what
elliot
couldn
t
i
ve
put
myself
in
the
wrong
you
ve
got
it
was
a
poor
beginning
as
i
have
got
you
said
rickie
controlling
himself
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
you
there
has
been
a
ghastly
but
stephen
with
a
countryman
s
persistency
continued
on
his
own
line
he
meant
to
be
civil
but
rickie
went
cold
round
the
mouth
for
he
had
not
even
been
angry
with
them
until
he
was
drunk
they
had
been
dirty
people
not
his
sort
then
the
trivial
injury
recurred
and
he
had
reeled
to
smash
them
as
he
passed
and
i
will
pay
for
everything
was
his
refrain
with
which
the
sighing
of
raindrops
mingled
you
shan
t
lose
a
penny
if
only
you
let
me
you
ll
pay
for
my
coffin
if
you
talk
like
that
any
longer
will
you
one
forgive
my
frightful
behaviour
two
live
with
me
for
his
only
hope
was
in
a
cheerful
precision
stephen
grew
more
agitated
he
thought
it
was
some
trick
i
was
saying
i
made
an
unspeakable
mistake
ansell
put
me
right
but
it
was
too
late
to
find
you
don
t
think
i
got
off
easily
ansell
doesn
t
spare
one
and
you
ve
got
to
forgive
me
to
share
my
life
to
share
my
i
ve
brought
you
this
photograph
i
want
it
to
be
the
first
thing
you
accept
from
me
you
have
the
greater
right
i
know
all
the
story
now
you
know
who
it
is
oh
yes
but
i
don
t
want
to
drag
all
that
it
is
only
her
wish
if
we
live
together
she
was
planning
it
when
she
i
can
t
follow
because
to
share
your
life
did
you
know
i
called
here
last
sunday
week
yes
but
then
i
only
knew
half
i
thought
you
were
my
father
s
stephen
s
anger
and
bewilderment
were
increasing
he
stuttered
what
what
s
the
odds
if
you
did
i
hated
my
father
said
rickie
i
loved
my
and
never
had
the
phrases
seemed
so
destitute
of
meaning
last
sunday
week
interrupted
stephen
his
voice
suddenly
rising
i
came
to
call
on
you
not
as
this
or
that
s
son
not
to
fall
on
your
neck
nor
to
live
here
nor
damn
your
dirty
little
mind
i
meant
to
say
i
didn
t
come
for
money
sorry
sorry
i
simply
came
as
i
was
and
i
haven
t
altered
yes
yet
our
mother
for
me
she
has
risen
from
the
dead
since
then
i
know
i
was
wrong
and
where
do
i
come
in
he
kicked
the
hassock
i
haven
t
risen
from
the
dead
i
haven
t
altered
since
last
sunday
week
i
m
he
stuttered
again
he
could
not
quite
explain
what
he
was
the
man
towards
andover
after
all
he
was
having
principles
but
you
ve
his
voice
broke
i
mind
it
i
m
i
don
t
alter
blackguard
one
week
live
here
the
next
i
keep
to
one
or
the
other
you
ve
hurt
something
most
badly
in
me
that
i
didn
t
know
was
don
t
let
us
talk
said
rickie
it
gets
worse
every
minute
simply
say
you
forgive
me
shake
hands
and
have
done
with
that
i
won
t
that
i
couldn
t
in
fact
i
don
t
know
what
you
then
rickie
began
a
new
appeal
not
to
pity
for
now
he
was
in
no
mood
to
whimper
for
all
its
pathos
there
was
something
heroic
in
this
meeting
i
warn
you
to
stop
here
with
me
stephen
no
one
else
in
the
world
will
look
after
you
as
far
as
i
know
you
have
never
been
really
unhappy
yet
or
suffered
as
you
should
do
from
your
faults
last
night
you
nearly
killed
yourself
with
drink
never
mind
why
i
m
willing
to
cure
you
i
am
willing
and
i
warn
you
to
give
me
the
chance
forgive
me
or
not
as
you
choose
i
care
for
other
things
stephen
looked
at
him
at
last
faintly
approving
the
offer
was
ridiculous
but
it
did
treat
him
as
a
man
let
me
tell
you
of
a
fault
of
mine
and
how
i
was
punished
for
it
continued
rickie
two
years
ago
i
behaved
badly
to
you
up
at
the
rings
no
even
a
few
days
before
that
we
went
for
a
ride
and
i
thought
too
much
of
other
matters
and
did
not
try
to
understand
you
then
came
the
rings
and
in
the
evening
when
you
called
up
to
me
most
kindly
i
never
answered
but
the
ride
was
the
beginning
ever
since
then
i
have
taken
the
world
at
i
have
bothered
less
and
less
to
look
it
in
the
face
until
not
only
you
but
every
one
else
has
turned
unreal
never
ansell
he
kept
away
and
somehow
saved
himself
but
every
one
else
do
you
remember
in
one
of
tony
failing
s
books
cast
bitter
bread
upon
the
waters
and
after
many
days
it
really
does
come
back
to
you
this
had
been
true
of
my
life
it
will
be
equally
true
of
a
drunkard
s
and
i
warn
you
to
stop
with
i
can
t
stop
after
that
cheque
said
stephen
more
gently
but
i
do
remember
the
ride
i
was
a
bit
bored
agnes
who
had
not
been
seeing
to
the
breakfast
chose
this
moment
to
call
from
the
passage
of
course
he
can
t
stop
she
exclaimed
for
better
or
worse
it
s
settled
we
ve
none
of
us
altered
since
last
sunday
there
you
re
right
elliot
he
shouted
starting
out
of
the
temperate
past
we
haven
t
with
a
rare
flash
of
insight
he
turned
on
rickie
i
see
your
game
you
don
t
care
about
me
drinking
or
to
shake
my
hand
it
s
some
one
else
you
want
to
cure
as
it
were
that
old
photograph
you
talk
to
me
but
all
the
time
you
look
at
the
he
snatched
it
up
i
ve
my
own
ideas
of
good
manners
and
to
look
friends
between
the
eyes
is
one
of
them
and
this
he
tore
the
photograph
across
and
this
he
tore
it
again
and
these
he
flung
the
pieces
at
the
man
who
had
sunk
into
a
chair
for
my
part
i
m
then
rickie
was
heroic
no
longer
turning
round
in
his
chair
he
covered
his
face
the
man
was
right
he
did
not
love
him
even
as
he
had
never
hated
him
in
either
passion
he
had
degraded
him
to
be
a
symbol
for
the
vanished
past
the
man
was
right
and
would
have
been
lovable
he
longed
to
be
back
riding
over
those
windy
fields
to
be
back
in
those
mystic
circles
beneath
pure
sky
then
they
could
have
watched
and
helped
and
taught
each
other
until
the
word
was
a
reality
and
the
past
not
a
torn
photograph
but
demeter
the
goddess
rejoicing
in
the
spring
ah
if
he
had
seized
those
high
opportunities
for
they
led
to
the
highest
of
all
the
symbolic
moment
which
if
a
man
accepts
he
has
accepted
life
the
voice
of
agnes
which
had
lured
him
then
for
my
sake
she
had
whispered
pealed
over
him
now
in
triumph
abruptly
it
broke
into
sobs
that
had
the
effect
of
rain
he
started
up
the
anger
had
died
out
of
stephen
s
face
not
for
a
subtle
reason
but
because
here
was
a
woman
near
him
and
unhappy
she
tried
to
apologize
and
brought
on
a
fresh
burst
of
tears
something
had
upset
her
they
heard
her
locking
the
door
of
her
room
from
that
moment
their
intercourse
was
changed
why
does
she
keep
crying
today
mused
rickie
as
if
he
spoke
to
some
mutual
friend
i
can
make
a
guess
said
stephen
and
his
heavy
face
flushed
did
you
insult
her
he
asked
feebly
but
who
s
gerald
rickie
raised
his
hand
to
his
mouth
she
looked
at
me
as
if
she
knew
me
and
then
gasps
gerald
and
started
gerald
is
the
name
of
some
one
she
once
so
i
there
was
a
long
silence
in
which
they
could
hear
a
piteous
gulping
cough
where
is
he
now
asked
stephen
and
then
you
rickie
nodded
bad
this
sort
of
i
didn
t
know
of
this
particular
thing
she
acted
as
if
she
had
forgotten
him
perhaps
she
had
and
you
woke
him
up
there
are
queer
tricks
in
the
world
she
is
overstrained
she
has
probably
been
plotting
ever
since
you
burst
in
last
against
me
stephen
stood
irresolute
i
suppose
you
and
she
pulled
together
he
said
at
last
get
away
from
us
man
i
mind
losing
you
yet
it
s
as
well
you
don
t
oh
that
s
out
of
the
question
said
stephen
brushing
his
cap
if
you
ve
guessed
anything
i
d
be
obliged
if
you
didn
t
mention
it
i
ve
no
right
to
ask
but
i
d
be
he
nodded
and
walked
slowly
along
the
landing
and
down
the
stairs
rickie
accompanied
him
and
even
opened
the
front
door
it
was
as
if
agnes
had
absorbed
the
passion
out
of
both
of
them
the
suburb
was
now
wrapped
in
a
cloud
not
of
its
own
making
sigh
after
sigh
passed
along
its
streets
to
break
against
dripping
walls
the
school
the
houses
were
hidden
and
all
civilization
seemed
in
abeyance
only
the
simplest
sounds
the
simplest
desires
emerged
they
agreed
that
this
weather
was
strange
after
such
a
sunset
that
s
a
collie
said
stephen
listening
i
wish
you
d
have
some
breakfast
before
no
food
thanks
but
you
know
he
paused
it
s
all
been
a
muddle
and
i
ve
no
objection
to
your
coming
along
with
the
cloud
descended
lower
come
with
me
as
a
man
said
stephen
already
out
in
the
mist
not
as
a
brother
who
cares
what
people
did
years
back
we
re
alive
together
and
the
rest
is
cant
here
am
i
rickie
and
there
are
you
a
fair
wreck
they
ve
no
use
for
you
here
never
had
any
if
the
truth
was
known
and
they
ve
only
made
you
beastly
this
house
so
to
speak
has
the
rot
it
s
that
you
should
stephen
wait
a
minute
what
do
you
mean
wait
s
what
we
won
t
do
said
stephen
at
the
gate
i
must
ask
he
did
wait
for
a
minute
and
sobs
were
heard
faint
hopeless
vindictive
then
he
trudged
away
and
rickie
soon
lost
his
colour
and
his
form
but
a
voice
persisted
saying
come
i
do
mean
it
come
i
will
take
care
of
you
i
can
manage
the
words
were
kind
yet
it
was
not
for
their
sake
that
rickie
plunged
into
the
impalpable
cloud
in
the
voice
he
had
found
a
surer
guarantee
habits
and
sex
may
change
with
the
new
generation
features
may
alter
with
the
play
of
a
private
passion
but
a
voice
is
apart
from
these
it
lies
nearer
to
the
racial
essence
and
perhaps
to
the
divine
it
can
at
all
events
overleap
one
grave
xxxii
pembroke
did
not
receive
a
clear
account
of
what
had
happened
when
he
returned
for
the
interval
his
sister
he
told
her
frankly
was
concealing
something
from
him
she
could
make
no
reply
had
she
gone
mad
she
wondered
hitherto
she
had
pretended
to
love
her
husband
why
choose
such
a
moment
for
the
truth
but
i
understand
rickie
s
position
he
told
her
it
is
an
unbalanced
position
yet
i
understand
it
i
noted
its
approach
while
he
was
ill
he
imagines
himself
his
brother
s
keeper
therefore
we
must
make
concessions
we
must
the
negotiations
were
still
progressing
in
november
the
month
during
which
this
story
draws
to
its
close
i
understand
his
position
he
then
told
her
it
is
both
weak
and
defiant
he
is
still
with
those
ansells
read
this
letter
which
thanks
me
for
his
little
stories
we
sent
them
last
month
you
remember
such
of
them
as
we
could
find
it
seems
that
he
fills
up
his
time
by
writing
he
has
already
written
a
she
only
gave
him
half
her
attention
for
a
beautiful
wreath
had
just
arrived
from
the
florist
s
she
was
taking
it
up
to
the
cemetery
today
her
child
had
been
dead
a
year
on
the
other
hand
he
has
altered
his
will
fortunately
he
can
not
alter
much
but
i
fear
that
what
is
not
settled
on
you
will
go
should
i
read
what
i
wrote
on
this
point
and
also
my
minutes
of
the
interview
with
old
ansell
and
the
copy
of
my
correspondence
with
stephen
wonham
but
her
fly
was
announced
while
he
put
the
wreath
in
for
her
she
ran
for
a
moment
upstairs
a
few
tears
had
come
to
her
eyes
a
scandalous
divorce
would
have
been
more
bearable
than
this
withdrawal
people
asked
why
did
her
husband
leave
her
and
the
answer
came
oh
nothing
particular
he
only
couldn
t
stand
her
she
lied
and
taught
him
to
lie
she
kept
him
from
the
work
that
suited
him
from
his
friends
from
his
brother
in
a
word
she
tried
to
run
him
which
a
man
won
t
a
few
tears
not
many
to
her
life
never
showed
itself
as
a
classic
drama
in
which
by
trying
to
advance
our
fortunes
we
shatter
them
she
had
turned
stephen
out
of
wiltshire
and
he
fell
like
a
thunderbolt
on
sawston
and
on
herself
in
trying
to
gain
failing
s
money
she
had
probably
lost
money
which
would
have
been
her
own
but
irony
is
a
subtle
teacher
and
she
was
not
the
woman
to
learn
from
such
lessons
as
these
her
suffering
was
more
direct
three
men
had
wronged
her
therefore
she
hated
them
and
if
she
could
would
do
them
harm
these
negotiations
are
quite
useless
she
told
herbert
when
she
came
downstairs
we
had
much
better
bide
our
time
tell
me
just
about
stephen
wonham
he
drew
her
into
the
study
again
wonham
is
or
was
in
scotland
learning
to
farm
with
connections
of
the
ansells
i
believe
the
money
is
to
go
towards
setting
him
up
apparently
he
is
a
hard
worker
he
also
drinks
she
nodded
and
smiled
more
than
he
did
my
informant
tilliard
oh
i
ought
not
to
have
mentioned
his
name
he
is
one
of
the
better
sort
of
rickie
s
cambridge
friends
and
has
been
dreadfully
grieved
at
the
collapse
but
he
does
not
want
to
be
mixed
up
in
it
this
autumn
he
was
up
in
the
lowlands
close
by
and
very
kindly
made
a
few
unobtrusive
inquiries
for
me
the
man
is
becoming
an
habitual
she
smiled
again
stephen
had
evoked
her
secret
and
she
hated
him
more
for
that
than
for
anything
else
that
he
had
done
the
poise
of
his
shoulders
that
morning
it
was
no
more
had
recalled
gerald
if
only
she
had
not
been
so
tired
he
had
reminded
her
of
the
greatest
thing
she
had
known
and
to
her
cloudy
mind
this
seemed
degradation
she
had
turned
to
him
as
to
her
lover
with
a
look
which
a
man
of
his
type
understood
she
had
asked
for
his
pity
for
one
terrible
moment
she
had
desired
to
be
held
in
his
arms
even
herbert
was
surprised
when
she
said
i
m
glad
he
drinks
i
hope
he
ll
kill
himself
a
man
like
that
ought
never
to
have
been
perhaps
the
sins
of
the
parents
are
visited
on
the
children
said
herbert
taking
her
to
the
carriage
yet
it
is
not
for
us
to
i
feel
sure
he
will
be
punished
what
right
has
he
she
broke
off
what
right
had
he
to
our
common
humanity
it
was
a
hard
lesson
for
any
one
to
learn
for
agnes
it
was
impossible
stephen
was
illicit
abnormal
worse
than
a
man
diseased
yet
she
had
turned
to
him
he
had
drawn
out
the
truth
my
dear
don
t
cry
said
her
brother
drawing
up
the
windows
i
have
great
hopes
of
tilliard
the
silts
have
written
mrs
failing
will
do
what
she
can
as
she
drove
to
the
cemetery
her
bitterness
turned
against
ansell
who
had
kept
her
husband
alive
in
the
days
after
stephen
s
expulsion
if
he
had
not
been
there
rickie
would
have
renounced
his
mother
and
his
brother
and
all
the
outer
world
troubling
no
one
the
mystic
inherent
in
him
would
have
prevailed
so
ansell
himself
had
told
her
and
ansell
too
had
sheltered
the
fugitives
and
given
them
money
and
saved
them
from
the
ludicrous
checks
that
so
often
stop
young
men
but
when
she
reached
the
cemetery
and
stood
beside
the
tiny
grave
all
her
bitterness
all
her
hatred
were
turned
against
rickie
but
he
ll
come
back
in
the
end
she
thought
a
wife
has
only
to
wait
what
are
his
friends
beside
me
they
too
will
marry
i
have
only
to
wait
his
book
like
all
that
he
has
done
will
fail
his
brother
is
drinking
himself
away
poor
aimless
rickie
i
have
only
to
keep
civil
he
will
come
back
in
the
she
had
moved
and
found
herself
close
to
the
grave
of
gerald
the
flowers
she
had
planted
after
his
death
were
dead
and
she
had
not
liked
to
renew
them
there
lay
the
athlete
and
his
dust
was
as
the
little
child
s
whom
she
had
brought
into
the
world
with
such
hope
with
such
pain
xxxiii
that
same
day
rickie
feeling
neither
poor
nor
aimless
left
the
ansells
for
a
night
s
visit
to
cadover
his
aunt
had
invited
him
why
he
could
not
think
nor
could
he
think
why
he
should
refuse
the
invitation
she
could
not
annoy
him
now
and
he
was
not
vindictive
in
the
dell
near
madingley
he
had
cried
i
hate
no
one
in
his
ignorance
now
with
full
knowledge
he
hated
no
one
again
the
weather
was
pleasant
the
county
attractive
and
he
was
ready
for
a
little
change
maud
and
stewart
saw
him
off
stephen
who
was
down
for
the
holiday
had
been
left
with
his
chin
on
the
luncheon
table
he
had
wanted
to
come
also
rickie
pointed
out
that
you
can
not
visit
where
you
have
broken
the
windows
there
was
an
argument
there
generally
was
and
now
the
young
man
had
turned
sulky
let
him
do
what
he
likes
said
ansell
he
knows
more
than
we
do
he
knows
is
he
to
get
drunk
rickie
asked
most
and
to
go
where
he
isn
t
asked
maud
though
liking
a
little
spirit
in
a
man
declared
this
to
be
impossible
well
i
wish
you
joy
rickie
called
as
the
train
moved
away
he
means
mischief
this
evening
he
told
me
piously
that
he
felt
it
beating
up
but
we
ll
wait
for
you
to
pass
they
cried
for
the
salisbury
train
always
backed
out
of
the
station
and
then
returned
and
the
ansell
family
including
stewart
took
an
incredible
pleasure
in
seeing
it
do
this
the
carriage
was
empty
rickie
settled
himself
down
for
his
little
journey
first
he
looked
at
the
coloured
photographs
then
he
read
the
directions
for
obtaining
and
felt
the
texture
of
the
cushions
through
the
windows
a
interested
him
then
he
saw
the
ugly
little
town
that
was
now
his
home
and
up
its
chief
street
the
ansells
memorable
facade
the
spirit
of
a
genial
comedy
dwelt
there
it
was
so
absurd
so
kindly
the
house
was
divided
against
itself
and
yet
stood
metaphysics
commerce
social
aspirations
all
lived
together
in
harmony
ansell
had
done
much
but
one
was
tempted
to
believe
in
a
more
capricious
power
the
power
that
abstains
from
one
nips
or
is
nipped
and
never
knows
beforehand
quoted
rickie
and
opened
the
poems
of
shelley
a
man
less
foolish
than
you
supposed
how
pleasant
it
was
to
read
if
business
worried
him
if
stephen
was
noisy
or
ansell
perverse
there
still
remained
this
paradise
of
books
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
read
nothing
for
two
years
then
the
train
stopped
for
the
shunting
and
he
heard
protests
from
minor
officials
who
were
working
on
the
line
they
complained
that
some
one
who
didn
t
ought
to
had
mounted
on
the
footboard
of
the
carriage
stephen
s
face
appeared
convulsed
with
laughter
with
the
action
of
a
swimmer
he
dived
in
through
the
open
window
and
fell
comfortably
on
rickie
s
luggage
and
rickie
he
declared
it
was
the
finest
joke
ever
known
rickie
was
not
so
sure
you
ll
be
run
over
next
he
said
what
did
you
do
that
for
i
m
coming
with
you
he
giggled
rolling
all
that
he
could
on
to
the
dusty
floor
now
stephen
this
is
too
bad
get
up
we
went
into
the
whole
question
i
know
and
i
settled
we
wouldn
t
go
into
it
again
spoiling
my
well
it
s
execrable
now
he
was
waving
to
the
ansells
and
showing
them
a
piece
of
soap
it
was
all
his
luggage
and
even
that
he
abandoned
for
he
flung
it
at
stewart
s
lofty
brow
i
can
t
think
what
you
ve
done
it
for
you
know
how
strongly
i
stephen
replied
that
he
should
stop
in
the
village
meet
rickie
at
the
lodge
gates
that
kind
of
thing
it
s
execrable
taste
he
repeated
trying
to
keep
grave
well
you
did
all
you
could
he
exclaimed
with
sudden
sympathy
leaving
me
talking
to
old
ansell
you
might
have
thought
you
d
got
your
way
i
ve
as
much
taste
as
most
chaps
but
hang
it
your
aunt
isn
t
the
german
emperor
she
doesn
t
own
you
ass
sputtered
rickie
who
had
taken
to
laugh
at
nonsense
again
no
she
isn
t
he
repeated
blowing
a
kiss
out
of
the
window
to
maidens
why
we
started
for
wiltshire
on
the
wet
morning
when
stewart
found
us
at
sawston
railway
station
he
smiled
happily
i
never
thought
we
should
pull
well
we
didn
t
we
never
did
what
we
meant
it
s
nonsense
that
i
couldn
t
have
managed
you
alone
i
ve
a
notion
slip
out
after
your
dinner
this
evening
and
we
ll
get
thundering
tight
i
ve
a
notion
i
won
it
d
do
you
no
end
of
good
you
ll
get
to
know
people
shepherds
carters
he
waved
his
arms
vaguely
indicating
democracy
then
you
ll
and
then
but
i
ll
catch
you
promised
stephen
we
shall
carry
you
up
the
hill
to
bed
in
the
morning
you
wake
have
your
row
with
old
em
ly
she
kicks
you
out
we
meet
we
ll
meet
at
the
rings
he
danced
up
and
down
the
carriage
some
one
in
the
next
carriage
punched
at
the
partition
and
when
this
happens
all
lads
with
mettle
know
that
they
must
punch
the
partition
back
thank
you
i
ve
a
notion
i
won
t
said
rickie
when
the
noise
had
subsided
subsided
for
a
moment
only
for
the
following
conversation
took
place
to
an
accompaniment
of
dust
and
bangs
except
as
regards
the
rings
we
will
meet
then
i
ll
get
tight
by
no
you
won
yes
i
will
i
swore
to
do
something
special
this
evening
i
feel
like
in
that
case
i
get
out
at
the
next
he
was
laughing
but
quite
determined
stephen
had
grown
too
dictatorial
of
late
the
ansells
spoilt
him
it
s
bad
enough
having
you
there
at
all
having
you
there
drunk
is
impossible
i
d
sooner
not
visit
my
aunt
than
think
when
i
sat
with
her
that
you
re
down
in
the
village
teaching
her
labourers
to
be
as
beastly
as
yourself
go
if
you
will
but
not
with
why
shouldn
t
i
have
a
good
time
while
i
m
young
if
i
don
t
harm
any
one
said
stephen
defiantly
need
we
discuss
oh
i
can
stop
myself
any
minute
i
choose
i
just
say
i
won
t
to
you
or
any
other
fool
and
i
don
rickie
knew
that
the
boast
was
true
he
continued
there
is
also
a
thing
called
morality
you
may
learn
in
the
bible
and
also
from
the
greeks
that
your
body
is
a
so
you
said
in
your
longest
probably
i
wrote
like
a
prig
for
the
reason
that
i
have
never
been
tempted
in
this
way
but
surely
it
is
wrong
that
your
body
should
escape
i
don
t
follow
he
retorted
punching
it
isn
t
right
even
for
a
little
time
to
forget
that
you
i
suppose
you
ve
never
been
tempted
to
go
to
sleep
just
then
the
train
passed
through
a
coppice
in
which
the
grey
undergrowth
looked
no
more
alive
than
firewood
yet
every
twig
in
it
was
waiting
for
the
spring
rickie
knew
that
the
analogy
was
false
but
argument
confused
him
and
he
gave
up
this
line
of
attack
also
do
be
more
careful
over
life
if
your
body
escapes
you
in
one
thing
why
not
in
more
a
man
will
have
other
you
mean
women
said
stephen
quietly
pausing
for
a
moment
in
this
game
but
that
s
absolutely
different
that
would
be
harming
some
one
is
that
the
only
thing
that
keeps
you
straight
what
else
should
and
he
looked
not
into
rickie
but
past
him
with
the
wondering
eyes
of
a
child
rickie
nodded
and
referred
himself
to
the
window
he
observed
that
the
country
was
smoother
and
more
plastic
the
woods
had
gone
and
under
a
sky
long
contours
of
earth
were
flowing
and
merging
rising
a
little
to
bear
some
coronal
of
beeches
parting
a
little
to
disclose
some
green
valley
where
cottages
stood
under
elms
or
beside
translucent
waters
it
was
wiltshire
at
last
the
train
had
entered
the
chalk
at
last
it
slackened
at
a
wayside
platform
without
speaking
he
opened
the
door
what
s
that
for
to
go
stephen
had
forgotten
the
threat
he
said
that
this
was
not
playing
the
game
surely
i
can
t
have
you
going
promise
to
behave
decently
he
was
seized
and
pulled
away
from
the
door
we
change
at
salisbury
he
remarked
there
is
an
hour
to
wait
you
will
find
me
it
isn
t
fair
exploded
stephen
it
s
a
lowdown
trick
how
can
i
let
you
go
back
promise
oh
yes
yes
yes
but
for
this
occasion
no
no
for
the
rest
of
your
yes
yes
very
well
i
for
the
rest
of
your
life
somehow
it
pleased
him
that
stephen
should
bang
him
crossly
with
his
elbow
and
say
no
get
out
you
ve
gone
too
so
had
the
train
the
porter
at
the
end
of
the
wayside
platform
slammed
the
door
and
they
proceeded
toward
salisbury
through
the
slowly
modulating
downs
rickie
pretended
to
read
over
the
book
he
watched
his
brother
s
face
and
wondered
how
bad
temper
could
be
consistent
with
a
mind
so
radiant
in
spite
of
his
obstinacy
and
conceit
stephen
was
an
easy
person
to
live
with
he
never
fidgeted
or
nursed
hidden
grievances
or
indulged
in
a
shoddy
pride
though
he
spent
rickie
s
money
as
slowly
as
he
could
he
asked
for
it
without
apology
you
must
put
it
down
against
me
he
would
say
in
time
it
was
still
very
vague
he
would
rent
or
purchase
a
farm
there
is
no
formula
in
which
we
may
sum
up
decent
people
so
ansell
had
preached
and
had
of
course
proceeded
to
offer
a
formula
they
must
be
serious
they
must
be
serious
not
in
the
sense
of
glum
but
they
must
be
convinced
that
our
life
is
a
state
of
some
importance
and
our
earth
not
a
place
to
beat
time
on
of
so
much
stephen
was
convinced
he
showed
it
in
his
work
in
his
play
in
his
and
above
all
though
the
fact
is
hard
to
his
sacred
passion
for
alcohol
drink
today
is
an
unlovely
thing
between
us
and
the
heights
of
cithaeron
the
river
of
sin
now
flows
yet
the
cries
still
call
from
the
mountain
and
granted
a
man
has
responded
to
them
it
is
better
he
respond
with
the
candour
of
the
greek
i
shall
stop
at
the
thompsons
now
said
the
disappointed
reveller
rickie
did
not
press
his
triumph
but
it
was
a
happy
moment
partly
because
of
the
triumph
partly
because
he
was
sure
that
his
brother
must
care
for
him
stephen
was
too
selfish
to
give
up
any
pleasure
without
grave
reasons
he
was
certain
that
he
had
been
right
to
disentangle
himself
from
sawston
and
to
ignore
the
threats
and
tears
that
still
tempted
him
to
return
here
there
was
real
work
for
him
to
do
moreover
though
he
sought
no
reward
it
had
come
his
health
was
better
his
brain
sound
his
life
washed
clean
not
by
the
waters
of
sentiment
but
by
the
efforts
of
a
stephen
was
man
first
brother
afterwards
herein
lay
his
brutality
and
also
his
virtue
look
me
in
the
face
don
t
hang
on
me
clothes
that
don
t
belong
as
you
did
on
your
wife
giving
her
saint
s
robes
whereas
she
was
simply
a
woman
of
her
own
sort
who
needed
careful
watching
tear
up
the
photographs
here
am
i
and
there
are
you
the
rest
is
the
rest
was
not
cant
and
perhaps
stephen
would
confess
as
much
in
time
but
rickie
needed
a
tonic
and
a
man
not
a
brother
must
hold
it
to
his
lips
i
see
the
old
spire
he
called
and
then
added
i
don
t
mind
seeing
it
no
one
does
as
far
as
i
know
people
have
come
from
the
other
side
of
the
world
to
see
it
pious
people
but
i
don
t
hold
with
he
was
young
enough
to
be
uneasy
the
cathedral
a
fount
of
superstition
must
find
no
place
in
his
life
at
the
age
of
twenty
he
had
settled
things
i
ve
got
my
own
philosophy
he
once
told
ansell
and
i
don
t
care
a
straw
about
ansell
s
mirth
had
annoyed
him
not
a
little
and
it
was
strange
that
one
so
settled
should
feel
his
heart
leap
up
at
the
sight
of
an
old
spire
i
regard
it
as
a
public
building
he
told
rickie
who
agreed
it
s
useful
too
as
a
his
attitude
today
was
defensive
it
was
part
of
a
subtle
change
that
rickie
had
noted
in
him
since
his
return
from
scotland
his
face
gave
hints
of
a
new
maturity
you
can
see
the
old
spire
from
the
ridgeway
he
said
suddenly
laying
a
hand
on
rickie
s
knee
before
rain
as
clearly
as
any
telegraph
how
far
is
the
ridgeway
seventeen
which
direction
north
naturally
north
again
from
that
you
see
devizes
the
vale
of
pewsey
and
the
other
downs
also
towards
bath
it
is
something
of
a
view
you
ought
to
get
on
the
i
shouldn
t
have
time
for
or
beacon
hill
or
let
s
do
if
it
s
fine
i
suggest
the
it
will
be
then
he
murmured
the
names
of
villages
i
wish
you
could
live
here
said
rickie
kindly
i
believe
you
love
these
particular
acres
more
than
the
whole
stephen
replied
that
this
was
not
the
case
he
was
only
used
to
them
he
wished
they
were
driving
out
instead
of
waiting
for
the
cadchurch
train
they
had
advanced
into
salisbury
and
the
cathedral
a
public
building
was
grey
against
a
tender
sky
rickie
suggested
that
while
waiting
for
the
train
they
should
visit
it
he
spoke
of
the
incomparable
north
porch
i
ve
never
been
inside
it
and
i
never
will
sorry
to
shock
you
rickie
but
i
must
tell
you
plainly
i
m
an
atheist
i
don
t
believe
in
i
do
said
rickie
when
a
man
dies
it
s
as
if
he
s
never
been
he
asserted
the
train
drew
up
in
salisbury
station
here
a
little
incident
took
place
which
caused
them
to
alter
their
plans
they
found
outside
the
station
a
trap
driven
by
a
small
boy
who
had
come
in
from
cadford
to
fetch
some
that
ll
do
us
said
stephen
and
called
to
the
boy
if
i
pay
your
back
and
if
i
give
you
sixpence
as
well
will
you
let
us
drive
back
in
the
trap
the
boy
said
no
it
will
be
all
right
said
rickie
i
am
failing
s
the
boy
shook
his
head
and
you
know
wonham
the
boy
couldn
t
say
he
didn
t
then
what
s
your
objection
why
what
is
it
why
not
but
stephen
leant
against
the
and
spoke
of
other
matters
presently
the
boy
said
did
you
say
you
d
pay
my
back
wonham
yes
said
a
bystander
didn
t
you
hear
him
i
heard
him
right
now
stephen
laid
his
hand
on
the
saying
what
i
want
though
is
this
trap
here
of
yours
see
to
drive
in
back
myself
and
as
he
spoke
the
bystander
followed
him
in
canon
what
he
wants
though
is
that
there
trap
of
yours
see
to
drive
hisself
back
i
ve
no
objection
said
the
boy
as
if
deeply
offended
for
a
time
he
sat
motionless
and
then
got
down
remarking
i
won
t
rob
you
of
your
silly
little
fool
snapped
rickie
as
they
drove
through
the
town
stephen
looked
surprised
what
s
wrong
with
the
boy
he
had
to
think
it
over
no
one
had
asked
him
to
do
such
a
thing
before
next
time
he
d
let
us
have
the
trap
quick
not
if
he
had
driven
in
for
a
cabbage
instead
of
he
never
would
drive
in
for
a
rickie
shuffled
his
feet
but
his
irritation
passed
he
saw
that
the
little
incident
had
been
a
quiet
challenge
to
the
civilization
that
he
had
known
fill
up
every
moment
induce
esprit
de
he
reviewed
the
watchwords
of
the
last
two
years
and
found
that
they
ignored
personal
contest
personal
truces
personal
love
by
following
them
sawston
school
had
lost
its
quiet
usefulness
and
become
a
frothy
sea
wherein
plunged
dunwood
house
that
unnecessary
ship
humbled
he
turned
to
stephen
and
said
no
you
re
right
nothing
is
wrong
with
the
boy
he
was
honestly
thinking
it
but
stephen
had
forgotten
the
incident
or
else
he
was
not
inclined
to
talk
about
it
his
assertive
fit
was
over
the
direct
road
from
salisbury
to
cadover
is
extremely
dull
the
city
which
god
intended
to
keep
by
the
river
did
she
not
move
there
being
thirsty
in
the
reign
of
william
rufus
the
city
had
strayed
out
of
her
own
plain
climbed
up
her
slopes
and
tumbled
over
them
in
ugly
cataracts
of
brick
the
cataracts
are
still
short
and
doubtless
they
meet
or
create
some
commercial
need
but
instead
of
looking
towards
the
cathedral
as
all
the
city
should
they
look
outwards
at
a
pagan
entrenchment
as
the
city
should
not
they
neglect
the
poise
of
the
earth
and
the
sentiments
she
has
decreed
they
are
the
modern
spirit
through
them
the
road
descends
into
an
unobtrusive
country
where
nevertheless
the
power
of
the
earth
grows
stronger
streams
do
divide
distances
do
still
exist
it
is
easier
to
know
the
men
in
your
valley
than
those
who
live
in
the
next
across
a
waste
of
down
it
is
easier
to
know
men
well
the
country
is
not
paradise
and
can
show
the
vices
that
grieve
a
good
man
everywhere
but
there
is
room
in
it
and
leisure
i
suppose
said
rickie
as
the
twilight
fell
this
kind
of
thing
is
going
on
all
over
perhaps
he
meant
that
towns
are
after
all
excrescences
grey
fluxions
where
men
hurrying
to
find
one
another
have
lost
themselves
but
he
got
no
response
and
expected
none
turning
round
in
his
seat
he
watched
the
winter
sun
slide
out
of
a
quiet
sky
the
horizon
was
primrose
and
the
earth
against
it
gave
momentary
hints
of
purple
all
faded
no
pageant
would
conclude
the
gracious
day
and
when
he
turned
eastward
the
night
was
already
established
those
verlands
said
stephen
scarcely
above
his
breath
what
are
verlands
he
pointed
at
the
dusk
and
said
our
name
for
a
kind
of
then
he
drove
his
whip
into
its
socket
and
seemed
to
swallow
something
rickie
straining
his
eyes
for
verlands
could
only
see
a
tumbling
wilderness
of
brown
are
there
many
local
words
there
have
i
suppose
they
die
the
conversation
turned
curiously
in
the
tone
of
one
who
replies
he
said
i
expect
that
some
time
or
other
i
shall
i
expect
you
will
said
rickie
and
wondered
a
little
why
the
reply
seemed
not
abrupt
would
we
see
the
rings
in
the
daytime
from
here
we
do
see
them
but
mrs
failing
once
said
no
decent
woman
would
have
did
you
agree
to
that
drive
a
little
will
you
the
horse
went
slowly
forward
into
the
wilderness
that
turned
from
brown
to
black
then
a
luminous
glimmer
surrounded
them
and
the
air
grew
cooler
the
road
was
descending
between
parapets
of
chalk
but
rickie
mightn
t
i
find
a
girl
naturally
not
refined
and
be
happy
with
her
in
my
own
way
i
would
tell
her
straight
i
was
nothing
much
faithful
of
course
but
that
she
should
never
have
all
my
thoughts
out
of
no
disrespect
to
her
but
because
all
one
s
thoughts
can
t
belong
to
any
single
while
he
spoke
even
the
road
vanished
and
invisible
water
came
gurgling
through
the
the
horse
had
chosen
the
ford
you
can
t
own
people
at
least
a
fellow
can
t
it
may
be
different
for
a
poet
let
the
horse
drink
and
i
want
to
marry
some
one
and
don
t
yet
know
who
she
is
which
a
poet
again
will
tell
you
is
disgusting
does
it
disgust
you
being
nothing
much
surely
i
d
better
go
gently
for
it
s
something
rather
outside
that
makes
one
marry
if
you
follow
me
not
exactly
oneself
don
t
hurry
the
horse
we
want
to
marry
and
yet
i
can
t
explain
i
fancy
i
ll
go
wading
this
is
our
romantic
love
is
greater
than
this
there
are
men
and
women
we
know
it
from
history
who
have
been
born
into
the
world
for
each
other
and
for
no
one
else
who
have
accomplished
the
longest
journey
locked
in
each
other
s
arms
but
romantic
love
is
also
the
code
of
modern
morals
and
for
this
reason
popular
eternal
union
eternal
ownership
these
are
tempting
baits
for
the
average
man
he
swallows
them
will
not
confess
his
mistake
and
perhaps
to
cover
it
cries
dirty
cynic
at
such
a
man
as
stephen
rickie
watched
the
black
earth
unite
to
the
black
sky
but
the
sky
overhead
grew
clearer
and
in
it
twinkled
the
plough
and
the
central
stars
he
thought
of
his
brother
s
future
and
of
his
own
past
and
of
how
much
truth
might
lie
in
that
antithesis
of
ansell
s
a
man
wants
to
love
mankind
a
woman
wants
to
love
one
at
all
events
he
and
his
wife
had
illustrated
it
and
perhaps
the
conflict
so
tragic
in
their
own
case
was
elsewhere
the
salt
of
the
world
meanwhile
stephen
called
from
the
water
for
matches
there
was
some
trick
with
paper
which
mr
failing
had
showed
him
and
which
he
would
show
rickie
now
instead
of
talking
nonsense
bending
down
he
illuminated
the
dimpled
surface
of
the
ford
quite
a
he
said
and
his
face
flickered
out
in
the
darkness
yes
give
me
the
loose
paper
quick
crumple
it
into
a
rickie
obeyed
though
intent
on
the
transfigured
face
he
believed
that
a
new
spirit
dwelt
there
expelling
the
crudities
of
youth
he
saw
steadier
eyes
and
the
sign
of
manhood
set
like
a
bar
of
gold
upon
steadier
lips
some
faces
are
knit
by
beauty
or
by
intellect
or
by
a
great
passion
had
stephen
s
waited
for
the
touch
of
the
years
but
they
played
as
boys
who
continued
the
nonsense
of
the
railway
carriage
the
paper
caught
fire
from
the
match
and
spread
into
a
rose
of
flame
now
gently
with
me
said
stephen
and
they
laid
it
flowerlike
on
the
stream
gravel
and
tremulous
weeds
leapt
into
sight
and
then
the
flower
sailed
into
deep
water
and
up
leapt
the
two
arches
of
a
bridge
it
ll
strike
they
cried
no
it
won
t
it
s
chosen
the
left
and
one
arch
became
a
fairy
tunnel
dropping
diamonds
then
it
vanished
for
rickie
but
stephen
who
knelt
in
the
water
declared
that
it
was
still
afloat
far
through
the
arch
burning
as
if
it
would
burn
forever
xxxiv
the
carriage
that
mrs
failing
had
sent
to
meet
her
nephew
returned
from
cadchurch
station
empty
she
was
preparing
for
a
solitary
dinner
when
he
somehow
arrived
full
of
apologies
but
more
sedate
than
she
had
expected
she
cut
his
explanations
short
never
mind
how
you
got
here
you
are
here
and
i
am
quite
pleased
to
see
he
changed
his
clothes
and
they
proceeded
to
the
there
was
a
bright
fire
but
the
curtains
were
not
drawn
mr
failing
had
believed
that
windows
with
the
night
behind
are
more
beautiful
than
any
pictures
and
his
widow
had
kept
to
the
custom
it
was
brave
of
her
to
persevere
lumps
of
chalk
having
come
out
of
the
night
last
june
for
some
obscure
reason
not
so
obscure
to
rickie
she
had
preserved
them
as
mementoes
of
an
episode
seeing
them
in
a
row
on
the
mantelpiece
he
expected
that
their
first
topic
would
be
stephen
but
they
never
mentioned
him
though
he
was
latent
in
all
that
they
said
it
was
of
mr
failing
that
they
spoke
the
essays
had
been
a
success
she
was
really
pleased
the
book
was
brought
in
at
her
request
and
between
the
courses
she
read
it
aloud
to
her
nephew
in
her
soft
yet
unsympathetic
voice
then
she
sent
for
the
press
notices
after
all
no
one
despises
them
and
read
their
comments
on
her
introduction
she
wielded
a
graceful
pen
was
apt
adequate
suggestive
indispensable
unnecessary
so
the
meal
passed
pleasantly
away
for
no
one
could
so
well
combine
the
formal
with
the
unconventional
and
it
only
seemed
charming
when
papers
littered
her
stately
table
my
man
wrote
very
nicely
she
observed
now
you
read
me
something
out
of
him
that
you
like
read
the
true
he
took
the
book
and
found
let
us
love
one
another
let
our
children
physical
and
spiritual
love
one
another
it
is
all
that
we
can
do
perhaps
the
earth
will
neglect
our
love
perhaps
she
will
confirm
it
and
suffer
some
spire
mound
for
the
new
generations
to
he
wrote
that
when
he
was
young
later
on
he
doubted
whether
we
had
better
love
one
another
or
whether
the
earth
will
confirm
anything
he
died
a
most
unhappy
he
could
not
help
saying
not
knowing
that
the
earth
had
confirmed
has
she
it
is
quite
possible
we
meet
so
seldom
in
these
days
she
and
i
do
you
see
much
of
the
earth
a
do
you
expect
that
she
will
confirm
you
it
is
quite
beware
of
her
rickie
i
i
think
beware
of
her
surely
going
back
to
her
really
is
going
back
throwing
away
the
artificiality
which
though
you
young
people
won
t
confess
it
is
the
only
good
thing
in
life
don
t
pretend
you
are
simple
once
i
pretended
don
t
pretend
that
you
care
for
anything
but
for
clever
talk
such
as
this
and
for
the
talk
said
leighton
afterwards
certainly
was
clever
but
it
meant
something
all
the
he
heard
no
more
for
his
mistress
told
him
to
retire
and
my
nephew
this
being
so
make
up
your
quarrel
with
your
she
stretched
out
her
hand
to
him
with
real
feeling
it
is
easier
now
than
it
will
be
later
poor
lady
she
has
written
to
me
foolishly
and
often
but
on
the
whole
i
side
with
her
against
you
she
would
grant
you
all
that
you
fought
for
all
the
people
all
the
theories
i
have
it
in
her
writing
that
she
will
never
interfere
with
your
life
she
can
not
help
interfering
said
rickie
with
his
eyes
on
the
black
windows
she
despises
me
besides
i
do
not
love
i
know
my
dear
nor
she
you
i
am
not
being
sentimental
i
say
once
more
beware
of
the
earth
we
are
conventional
people
and
conventions
if
you
will
but
see
it
are
majestic
in
their
way
and
will
claim
us
in
the
end
we
do
not
live
for
great
passions
or
for
great
memories
or
for
anything
he
threw
up
his
head
we
now
listen
to
me
i
am
serious
and
friendly
tonight
as
you
must
have
observed
i
have
asked
you
here
partly
to
amuse
myself
you
belong
to
my
march
past
but
also
to
give
you
good
advice
there
has
been
a
volcano
a
phenomenon
which
i
too
once
greatly
admired
the
eruption
is
over
let
the
conventions
do
their
work
now
and
clear
the
rubbish
away
my
age
is
and
i
tell
you
solemnly
that
the
important
things
in
life
are
little
things
and
that
people
are
not
important
at
all
go
back
to
your
he
looked
at
her
and
was
filled
with
pity
he
knew
that
he
would
never
be
frightened
of
her
again
only
because
she
was
serious
and
friendly
did
he
trouble
himself
to
reply
there
is
one
little
fact
i
should
like
to
tell
you
as
confuting
your
theory
the
idea
of
a
story
a
long
story
had
been
in
my
head
for
a
year
as
a
dream
to
amuse
myself
the
kind
of
amusement
you
would
recommend
for
the
future
i
should
have
had
time
to
write
it
but
the
people
round
me
coloured
my
life
and
so
it
never
seemed
worth
while
for
the
story
is
not
likely
to
pay
then
came
the
volcano
a
few
days
after
it
was
over
i
lay
in
bed
looking
out
upon
a
world
of
rubbish
two
men
i
know
one
intellectual
the
other
very
much
the
reverse
burst
into
the
room
they
said
what
happened
to
your
short
stories
they
weren
t
good
but
where
are
they
why
have
you
stopped
writing
why
haven
t
you
been
to
italy
you
must
write
you
must
go
because
to
write
to
go
is
well
i
have
written
and
yesterday
we
sent
the
long
story
out
on
its
rounds
the
men
do
not
like
it
for
different
reasons
but
it
mattered
very
much
to
them
that
i
should
write
it
and
so
it
got
written
as
i
told
you
this
is
only
one
fact
other
facts
i
trust
have
happened
in
the
last
five
months
but
i
mention
it
to
prove
that
people
are
important
and
therefore
however
much
it
inconveniences
my
wife
i
will
not
go
back
to
and
italy
asked
mrs
failing
this
question
he
avoided
italy
must
wait
now
that
he
had
the
time
he
had
not
the
money
or
what
is
the
long
story
about
then
about
a
man
and
a
woman
who
meet
and
are
somewhat
of
a
tour
de
force
i
he
frowned
in
literature
we
needn
t
intrude
our
own
limitations
i
m
not
so
silly
as
to
think
that
all
marriages
turn
out
like
mine
my
character
is
to
blame
for
our
catastrophe
not
my
dear
i
too
have
married
marriage
is
to
but
here
again
he
seemed
to
know
better
well
she
said
leaving
the
table
and
moving
with
her
dessert
to
the
mantelpiece
so
you
are
abandoning
marriage
and
taking
to
literature
and
are
because
as
we
used
to
say
at
cambridge
the
cow
is
there
the
world
is
real
again
this
is
a
room
that
a
window
outside
is
the
go
he
pointed
to
the
floor
the
day
is
straight
below
shining
through
other
windows
into
other
you
are
very
odd
she
said
after
a
pause
and
i
do
not
like
you
at
all
there
you
sit
eating
my
biscuits
and
all
the
time
you
know
that
the
earth
is
round
who
taught
you
i
am
going
to
bed
now
and
all
the
night
you
tell
me
you
and
i
and
the
biscuits
go
plunging
eastwards
until
we
reach
the
sun
but
breakfast
will
be
at
nine
as
usual
she
rang
the
bell
twice
and
her
maid
came
with
her
candle
and
her
it
was
her
habit
of
late
to
go
to
her
room
as
soon
as
dinner
was
over
for
she
had
no
one
to
sit
up
with
rickie
was
impressed
by
her
loneliness
and
also
by
the
mixture
in
her
of
insight
and
obtuseness
she
was
so
quick
so
so
imaginative
even
but
all
the
same
she
had
forgotten
what
people
were
like
finding
life
dull
she
had
dropped
lies
into
it
as
a
chemist
drops
a
new
element
into
a
solution
hoping
that
life
would
thereby
sparkle
or
turn
some
beautiful
colour
she
loved
to
mislead
others
and
in
the
end
her
private
view
of
false
and
true
was
obscured
and
she
misled
herself
how
she
must
have
enjoyed
their
errors
over
stephen
but
her
own
error
had
been
greater
inasmuch
as
it
was
spiritual
entirely
leighton
came
in
with
some
coffee
feeling
it
unnecessary
to
light
the
lamp
for
one
small
young
man
he
persuaded
rickie
to
say
he
preferred
the
so
rickie
sat
down
by
the
fire
playing
with
one
of
the
lumps
of
chalk
his
thoughts
went
back
to
the
ford
from
which
they
had
scarcely
wandered
still
he
heard
the
horse
in
the
dark
drinking
still
he
saw
the
mystic
rose
and
the
tunnel
dropping
diamonds
he
had
driven
away
alone
believing
the
earth
had
confirmed
him
he
stood
behind
things
at
last
and
knew
that
conventions
are
not
majestic
and
that
they
will
not
claim
us
in
the
end
as
he
mused
the
chalk
slipped
from
his
fingers
and
fell
on
the
which
broke
the
china
said
leighton
was
expensive
he
believed
it
was
impossible
to
match
it
now
each
cup
was
different
it
was
a
harlequin
set
the
saucer
without
the
cup
was
therefore
useless
would
elliot
please
explain
to
mrs
failing
how
it
happened
rickie
promised
he
would
explain
he
had
left
stephen
preparing
to
bathe
and
had
heard
him
working
like
an
animal
splashing
in
the
shallows
breathing
heavily
as
he
swam
the
pools
at
times
reeds
snapped
or
clods
of
earth
were
pulled
in
by
the
fire
he
remembered
it
was
again
november
should
you
like
a
walk
he
asked
leighton
and
told
him
who
stopped
in
the
village
tonight
leighton
was
pleased
at
nine
o
clock
the
two
young
men
left
the
house
under
a
sky
that
was
still
only
bright
in
the
zenith
it
will
rain
tomorrow
leighton
said
my
brother
says
fine
fine
tomorrow
leighton
echoed
now
which
do
you
mean
asked
rickie
laughing
since
the
plumes
of
the
touched
over
the
drive
only
a
very
little
light
penetrated
it
was
clearer
outside
the
lodge
gate
and
bubbles
of
air
which
wiltshire
seemed
to
have
travelled
from
an
immense
distance
broke
gently
and
separately
on
his
face
they
paused
on
the
bridge
he
asked
whether
the
little
fish
and
the
bright
green
weeds
were
here
now
as
well
as
in
the
summer
the
footman
had
not
noticed
over
the
bridge
they
came
to
the
of
which
one
led
to
salisbury
and
the
other
up
through
the
string
of
villages
to
the
railway
station
the
road
in
front
was
only
the
roman
road
the
one
that
went
on
to
the
downs
turning
to
the
left
they
were
in
cadford
he
will
be
with
the
thompsons
said
rickie
looking
up
at
dark
eaves
perhaps
he
s
in
bed
perhaps
he
will
be
at
the
no
tonight
he
is
with
the
with
the
after
a
dozen
paces
he
said
the
thompsons
have
gone
where
why
they
were
turned
out
by
wilbraham
on
account
of
our
broken
are
you
sure
five
families
were
turned
that
s
bad
for
stephen
said
rickie
after
a
pause
he
was
looking
forward
oh
it
s
monstrous
in
any
case
but
the
thompsons
have
gone
to
london
said
leighton
why
that
family
they
say
it
s
been
in
the
valley
hundreds
of
years
and
never
got
beyond
shepherding
to
various
parts
of
let
us
try
the
antelope
let
us
try
the
the
inn
lay
up
in
the
village
rickie
hastened
his
pace
this
tyranny
was
monstrous
some
men
of
the
age
of
undergraduates
had
broken
windows
and
therefore
they
and
their
families
were
to
be
ruined
the
fools
who
govern
us
find
it
easier
to
be
severe
it
saves
them
trouble
to
say
the
innocent
must
suffer
with
the
it
even
gives
them
a
thrill
of
pride
against
all
this
wicked
nonsense
against
the
wilbrahams
and
pembrokes
who
try
to
rule
our
world
stephen
would
fight
till
he
died
stephen
was
a
hero
he
was
a
law
to
himself
and
rightly
he
was
great
enough
to
despise
our
small
moralities
he
was
attaining
love
this
evening
rickie
caught
ansell
s
enthusiasm
and
felt
it
worth
while
to
sacrifice
everything
for
such
a
man
the
antelope
said
leighton
those
lights
under
the
greatest
would
you
please
ask
if
he
s
there
and
if
he
d
come
for
a
turn
with
me
i
don
t
think
i
ll
go
leighton
opened
the
door
they
saw
a
little
room
blue
with
flanking
the
fire
were
deep
settles
hiding
all
but
the
legs
of
the
men
who
lounged
in
them
between
the
settles
stood
a
table
covered
with
mugs
and
glasses
the
scene
was
picturesque
fairer
than
the
cutglass
palaces
of
the
town
oh
yes
he
s
there
he
called
and
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
came
out
would
he
come
no
i
shouldn
t
say
so
replied
leighton
with
a
furtive
glance
he
knew
that
rickie
was
a
milksop
first
night
you
know
sir
among
old
yes
i
know
said
rickie
but
he
might
like
a
turn
down
the
village
it
looks
stuffy
inside
there
and
poor
fun
probably
to
watch
others
leighton
shut
the
door
what
was
that
he
called
after
you
oh
nothing
a
man
when
he
s
drunk
he
says
the
worst
he
s
ever
heard
at
least
so
they
a
man
when
he
s
drunk
yes
but
stephen
isn
t
drinking
no
he
couldn
t
be
if
he
broke
a
promise
i
don
t
pretend
he
s
a
saint
i
don
t
want
him
one
but
it
isn
t
in
him
to
break
a
yes
sir
i
in
the
train
he
promised
me
not
to
drink
nothing
theatrical
just
a
promise
for
these
few
no
no
sir
stamped
rickie
yes
no
yes
can
t
you
speak
out
is
he
drunk
or
isn
t
he
leighton
justly
exasperated
cried
he
can
t
stand
and
i
ve
told
you
so
again
and
stephen
shouted
rickie
darting
up
the
steps
heat
and
the
smell
of
beer
awaited
him
and
he
spoke
more
furiously
than
he
had
intended
is
there
any
one
here
who
s
sober
he
cried
the
landlord
looked
over
the
bar
angrily
and
asked
him
what
he
meant
he
pointed
to
the
deep
settles
inside
there
he
s
drunk
tell
him
he
s
broken
his
word
and
i
will
not
go
with
him
to
the
very
well
you
won
t
go
with
him
to
the
rings
said
the
landlord
stepping
forward
and
slamming
the
door
in
his
face
in
the
room
he
was
only
angry
but
out
in
the
cool
air
he
remembered
that
stephen
was
a
law
to
himself
he
had
chosen
to
break
his
word
and
would
break
it
again
nothing
else
bound
him
to
yield
to
temptation
is
not
fatal
for
most
of
us
but
it
was
the
end
of
everything
for
a
hero
he
s
suddenly
ruined
he
cried
not
yet
remembering
himself
for
a
little
he
stood
by
the
clutching
the
ridges
of
its
bark
even
so
would
he
wrestle
tomorrow
and
stephen
imperturbable
reply
my
body
is
my
or
worse
still
he
might
wrestle
with
a
pliant
stephen
who
promised
him
glibly
again
while
he
prayed
for
a
miracle
to
convert
his
brother
it
struck
him
that
he
must
pray
for
himself
for
he
too
was
ruined
why
what
s
the
matter
asked
leighton
stephen
s
only
being
with
friends
elliot
sir
don
t
break
down
nothing
s
happened
bad
no
one
s
died
yet
or
even
hurt
ever
kind
he
took
hold
of
rickie
s
arm
and
pitying
such
a
nervous
fellow
set
out
with
him
for
home
the
shoulders
of
orion
rose
behind
them
over
the
topmost
boughs
of
the
elm
from
the
bridge
the
whole
constellation
was
visible
and
rickie
said
may
god
receive
me
and
pardon
me
for
trusting
the
but
elliot
what
have
you
done
that
s
wrong
gone
bankrupt
leighton
for
the
second
time
pretended
again
that
people
were
real
may
god
have
mercy
on
me
leighton
dropped
his
arm
though
he
did
not
understand
a
chill
of
disgust
passed
over
him
and
he
said
i
will
go
back
to
the
antelope
i
will
help
them
put
stephen
to
do
i
will
wait
for
you
then
he
leant
against
the
parapet
and
prayed
passionately
for
he
knew
that
the
conventions
would
claim
him
soon
god
was
beyond
them
but
ah
how
far
beyond
and
to
be
reached
after
what
degradation
at
the
end
of
this
childish
detour
his
wife
awaited
him
not
less
surely
because
she
was
only
his
wife
in
name
he
was
too
weak
books
and
friends
were
not
enough
little
by
little
she
would
claim
him
and
corrupt
him
and
make
him
what
he
had
been
and
the
woman
he
loved
would
die
out
in
drunkenness
in
debauchery
and
her
strength
would
be
dissipated
by
a
man
her
beauty
defiled
in
a
man
she
would
not
continue
that
mystic
rose
and
the
face
it
illumined
meant
nothing
the
stream
he
was
above
it
now
meant
nothing
though
it
burst
from
the
pure
turf
and
ran
for
ever
to
the
sea
the
bather
the
shoulders
of
all
meant
nothing
and
were
going
nowhere
the
whole
affair
was
a
ridiculous
dream
leighton
returned
saying
haven
t
you
seen
stephen
they
say
he
followed
us
he
can
still
walk
i
told
you
he
wasn
t
so
i
don
t
think
he
passed
me
ought
one
to
look
he
wandered
a
little
along
the
roman
road
again
nothing
mattered
at
the
he
leant
on
the
gate
to
watch
a
slow
goods
train
pass
in
the
glare
of
the
engine
he
saw
that
his
brother
had
come
this
way
perhaps
through
some
sodden
memory
of
the
rings
and
now
lay
drunk
over
the
rails
wearily
he
did
a
man
s
duty
there
was
time
to
raise
him
up
and
push
him
into
safety
it
is
also
a
man
s
duty
to
save
his
own
life
and
therefore
he
tried
the
train
went
over
his
knees
he
died
up
in
cadover
whispering
you
have
been
right
to
mrs
failing
she
wrote
of
him
to
lewin
afterwards
as
one
who
has
failed
in
all
he
undertook
one
of
the
thousands
whose
dust
returns
to
the
dust
accomplishing
nothing
in
the
interval
agnes
and
i
buried
him
to
the
sound
of
our
cracked
bell
and
pretended
that
he
had
once
been
alive
the
other
who
was
always
honest
kept
xxxv
from
the
window
they
looked
over
a
sober
valley
whose
sides
were
not
too
sloping
to
be
ploughed
and
whose
trend
was
followed
by
a
track
it
was
late
on
sunday
afternoon
and
the
valley
was
deserted
except
for
one
labourer
who
was
coasting
slowly
downward
on
a
rosy
bicycle
the
air
was
very
quiet
a
jay
screamed
up
in
the
woods
behind
but
the
who
roost
early
were
already
silent
since
the
window
opened
westward
the
room
was
flooded
with
light
and
stephen
finding
it
hot
was
working
in
his
shirtsleeves
you
guarantee
they
ll
sell
he
asked
with
a
pen
between
his
teeth
he
was
tidying
up
a
pile
of
manuscripts
i
guarantee
that
the
world
will
be
the
gainer
said
pembroke
now
a
clergyman
who
sat
beside
him
at
the
table
with
an
expression
of
refined
disapproval
on
his
face
i
d
got
the
idea
that
the
long
story
had
its
points
but
that
these
shorter
things
didn
t
what
s
the
word
convince
is
probably
the
word
you
want
but
that
type
of
criticism
is
quite
a
thing
of
the
past
have
you
seen
the
illustrated
american
edition
i
don
t
might
i
send
you
a
copy
i
think
you
ought
to
possess
thank
his
eye
wandered
the
bicycle
had
disappeared
into
some
trees
and
thither
through
a
cloudless
sky
the
sun
was
also
descending
is
all
quite
plain
said
pembroke
submit
these
ten
stories
to
the
magazines
and
make
your
own
terms
with
the
editors
then
i
have
your
word
for
it
you
will
join
forces
with
me
and
the
four
stories
in
my
possession
together
with
yours
should
make
up
a
volume
which
we
might
well
call
pan
are
you
sure
pipes
haven
t
been
used
up
already
pembroke
clenched
his
teeth
he
had
been
bearing
with
this
sort
of
thing
for
nearly
an
hour
if
that
is
the
case
we
can
select
another
a
title
is
easy
to
come
by
but
that
is
the
idea
it
must
suggest
the
stories
as
i
have
twice
explained
to
you
all
centre
round
a
nature
theme
pan
being
the
god
of
i
know
that
said
stephen
impatiently
being
the
god
of
all
right
let
s
get
furrard
i
ve
learnt
it
was
years
since
the
schoolmaster
had
been
interrupted
and
he
could
not
stand
it
very
well
he
said
i
bow
to
your
superior
knowledge
of
the
classics
let
us
oh
yes
the
introduction
there
must
be
one
it
was
the
introduction
with
all
those
wrong
details
that
sold
the
other
you
overwhelm
me
i
never
penned
the
memoir
with
that
if
you
won
t
do
one
keynes
must
my
sister
leads
a
busy
life
i
could
not
ask
her
i
will
do
it
myself
since
you
and
the
binding
the
binding
said
pembroke
coldly
must
really
be
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
publisher
we
can
not
be
concerned
with
such
details
our
task
is
purely
his
attention
wandered
he
began
to
fidget
and
finally
bent
down
and
looked
under
the
table
what
have
we
here
he
asked
stephen
looked
also
and
for
a
moment
they
smiled
at
each
other
over
the
prostrate
figure
of
a
child
who
was
cuddling
pembroke
s
boots
she
s
after
the
blacking
he
explained
if
we
left
her
there
she
d
lick
them
indeed
is
that
so
very
safe
it
never
did
me
any
harm
come
up
your
tongue
s
can
i
she
was
understood
to
ask
whether
she
could
clean
her
tongue
on
a
lollie
no
no
said
pembroke
lollipops
don
t
clean
little
girls
yes
they
do
he
retorted
but
she
won
t
get
he
lifted
her
on
his
knee
and
rasped
her
tongue
with
his
handkerchief
dear
little
thing
said
the
visitor
perfunctorily
the
child
began
to
squall
and
kicked
her
father
in
the
stomach
stephen
regarded
her
quietly
you
tried
to
hurt
me
he
said
hurting
doesn
t
count
trying
to
hurt
counts
go
and
clean
your
tongue
yourself
get
off
my
tears
of
another
sort
came
into
her
eyes
but
she
obeyed
him
how
s
the
great
bertie
he
asked
thank
you
my
nephew
is
perfectly
well
how
came
you
to
hear
of
his
existence
through
the
silts
of
course
it
isn
t
five
miles
to
pembroke
raised
his
eyes
mournfully
i
can
not
conceive
how
the
poor
silts
go
on
in
that
great
house
whatever
she
intended
it
could
not
have
been
that
the
house
the
farm
the
money
everything
down
to
the
personal
articles
that
belong
to
mr
failing
and
should
have
reverted
to
his
family
it
s
legal
interstate
i
do
not
dispute
it
but
it
is
a
lesson
to
one
to
make
a
will
keynes
and
myself
were
they
ll
do
there
they
offered
me
the
agency
but
he
looked
down
the
cultivated
slopes
his
manners
were
growing
rough
for
he
saw
few
gentlemen
now
and
he
was
either
incoherent
or
else
alarmingly
direct
however
if
lawrie
silt
s
a
cockney
like
his
father
and
if
my
next
is
a
boy
and
like
me
a
shy
beautiful
look
came
into
his
eyes
and
passed
unnoticed
they
ll
do
he
repeated
they
turned
out
wilbraham
and
built
new
cottages
and
bridged
the
railway
and
made
other
necessary
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
pembroke
took
out
his
watch
i
wonder
if
i
might
have
the
trap
i
mustn
t
miss
my
train
must
i
it
is
good
of
you
to
have
granted
me
an
interview
it
is
all
quite
plain
a
case
of
half
and
of
half
and
half
said
the
young
farmer
slowly
what
do
you
take
me
for
half
and
half
when
i
provide
ten
of
the
stories
and
you
only
four
i
i
stammered
pembroke
i
consider
you
did
me
over
the
long
story
and
i
m
damned
if
you
do
me
over
the
short
ones
hush
if
you
please
hush
if
only
for
your
little
girl
s
he
lifted
a
clerical
palm
you
did
me
his
voice
drove
and
all
the
articles
won
t
stop
me
saying
so
that
long
story
was
meant
to
be
mine
i
got
it
written
you
ve
done
me
out
of
every
penny
it
fetched
it
s
dedicated
to
me
flat
out
and
you
even
crossed
out
the
dedication
and
tidied
me
out
of
the
introduction
listen
to
me
pembroke
you
ve
done
people
all
your
life
i
think
without
knowing
it
but
that
won
t
comfort
us
a
wretched
devil
at
your
school
once
wrote
to
me
and
he
d
been
done
sham
food
sham
religion
sham
straight
talks
and
when
he
broke
down
you
said
it
was
the
world
in
he
snatched
at
him
roughly
but
i
ll
show
you
the
he
twisted
him
round
like
a
baby
and
through
the
open
door
they
saw
only
the
quiet
valley
but
in
it
a
rivulet
that
would
in
time
bring
its
waters
to
the
sea
look
even
at
that
and
up
behind
where
the
plain
begins
and
you
get
on
the
solid
chalk
think
of
us
riding
some
night
when
you
re
ordering
your
hot
bottle
that
s
the
world
and
there
s
no
miniature
world
there
s
one
world
pembroke
and
you
can
t
tidy
men
out
of
it
they
answer
you
back
do
you
hear
they
answer
back
if
you
do
them
if
you
tell
a
man
this
way
that
four
sheep
equal
ten
he
answers
back
you
re
a
pembroke
was
speechless
and
such
is
human
nature
he
chiefly
resented
the
allusion
to
the
hot
bottle
an
unmanly
luxury
in
which
he
never
indulged
contenting
himself
with
nightsocks
enough
there
is
no
witness
present
as
you
have
doubtless
but
there
was
for
a
little
voice
cried
oh
mummy
they
re
fighting
such
fun
and
feet
went
pattering
up
the
stairs
enough
you
talk
of
doing
but
what
about
the
money
out
of
which
you
did
my
sister
what
about
this
picture
he
pointed
to
a
faded
photograph
of
stockholm
which
you
caused
to
be
filched
from
the
walls
of
my
house
what
about
enough
let
us
conclude
this
disheartening
scene
you
object
to
my
terms
name
yours
i
shall
accept
them
it
is
futile
to
reason
with
one
who
is
the
worse
for
stephen
was
quiet
at
once
steady
on
he
said
gently
steady
on
in
that
direction
take
for
your
four
stories
and
the
introduction
and
i
will
keep
for
then
he
went
to
harness
the
horse
while
pembroke
watching
his
broad
back
desired
to
bury
a
knife
in
it
the
desire
passed
partly
because
it
was
unclerical
partly
because
he
had
no
knife
and
partly
because
he
soon
blurred
over
what
had
happened
to
him
all
criticism
was
rudeness
he
never
heeded
it
for
he
never
needed
it
he
was
never
wrong
all
his
life
he
had
ordered
little
human
beings
about
and
now
he
was
equally
magisterial
to
big
ones
stephen
was
a
lout
whom
owing
to
some
flaw
in
the
regulations
he
could
not
send
up
to
the
headmaster
to
be
caned
this
attitude
makes
for
tranquillity
before
long
he
felt
merely
an
injured
martyr
his
brain
cleared
he
stood
deep
in
thought
before
the
only
other
picture
that
the
bare
room
boasted
the
demeter
of
cnidus
outside
the
sun
was
sinking
and
its
last
rays
fell
upon
the
immortal
features
and
the
shattered
knees
offered
their
fragrance
and
with
it
there
entered
those
more
mysterious
scents
that
come
from
no
one
flower
or
clod
of
earth
but
from
the
whole
bosom
of
evening
he
tried
not
to
be
cynical
but
in
his
heart
he
could
not
regret
that
tragedy
already
conventionalized
indistinct
of
course
death
is
a
terrible
thing
yet
death
is
merciful
when
it
weeds
out
a
failure
if
we
look
deep
enough
it
is
all
for
the
best
he
stared
at
the
picture
and
nodded
stephen
who
had
met
his
visitor
at
the
station
had
intended
to
drive
him
back
there
but
after
their
spurt
of
temper
he
sent
him
with
the
boy
he
remained
in
the
doorway
glad
that
he
was
going
to
make
money
glad
that
he
had
been
angry
while
the
glow
of
the
clear
sky
deepened
and
the
silence
was
perfected
and
the
scents
of
the
night
grew
stronger
old
vagrancies
awoke
and
he
resolved
that
dearly
as
he
loved
his
house
he
would
not
enter
it
again
till
dawn
goodnight
he
called
and
then
the
child
came
running
and
he
whispered
quick
then
bring
me
a
he
repeated
and
a
pleasant
voice
called
through
an
upper
window
why
he
did
not
answer
until
the
child
was
wrapped
up
in
his
arms
it
is
time
that
she
learnt
to
sleep
out
he
cried
if
you
want
me
we
re
out
on
the
hillside
where
i
used
to
the
voice
protested
saying
this
and
that
stewart

in
the
house
said
the
man
and
it
can
not
matter
and
i
am
going
stephen
i
wish
you
wouldn
t

wish
you
wouldn
t

promise

won
t
say
foolish
things
to
her
don
t
i
wish
you

come
up
for
a
minute
the
child
whose
face
was
laid
against
his
felt
the
muscles
in
it
harden
don
t
tell
her
foolish
things
about
yourself
things
that
aren
t
any
longer
true

t
worry

with
old
dead
dreadfulness
to
please
me

tonight

laughed
impertinently
i

m
being
kept
in
line
she
called
and
though
he
could
not
see
her
she
stretched
her
arms
towards
him
for
a
time
he
stood
motionless
under
her
window
musing
on
his
happy
tangible
life
then
his
breath
quickened
and
he
wondered
why
he
was
here
and
why
he
should
hold
a
warm
child
in
his
arms
it
s
time
we
were
starting
he
whispered
and
showed
the
sky
whose
orange
was
already
fading
into
green
wish
everything
dear
mummy
she
said
sleepily
goodnight
dear
house
you
pictures
long
picture
stone
lady
i
see
you
through
the
window
your
faces
are
the
twilight
descended
he
rested
his
lips
on
her
hair
and
carried
her
without
speaking
until
he
reached
the
open
down
he
had
often
slept
here
himself
alone
and
on
his
and
he
knew
that
the
turf
was
dry
and
that
if
you
laid
your
face
to
it
you
would
smell
the
thyme
for
a
moment
the
earth
aroused
her
and
she
began
to
chatter
my
prayers
she
said
anxiously
he
gave
her
one
hand
and
she
was
asleep
before
her
fingers
had
nestled
in
its
palm
their
touch
made
him
pensive
and
again
he
marvelled
why
he
the
accident
was
here
he
was
alive
and
had
created
life
by
whose
authority
though
he
could
not
phrase
it
he
believed
that
he
guided
the
future
of
our
race
and
that
century
after
century
his
thoughts
and
his
passions
would
triumph
in
england
the
dead
who
had
evoked
him
the
unborn
whom
he
would
evoke
he
governed
the
paths
between
them
by
whose
authority
out
in
the
west
lay
cadover
and
the
fields
of
his
earlier
youth
and
over
them
descended
the
crescent
moon
his
eyes
followed
her
decline
and
against
her
final
radiance
he
saw
or
thought
he
saw
the
outline
of
the
rings
he
had
always
been
grateful
as
people
who
understood
him
knew
but
this
evening
his
gratitude
seemed
a
gift
of
small
account
the
ear
was
deaf
and
what
thanks
of
his
could
reach
it
the
body
was
dust
and
in
what
ecstasy
of
his
could
it
share
the
spirit
had
fled
in
agony
and
loneliness
never
to
know
that
it
bequeathed
him
salvation
he
filled
his
pipe
and
then
sat
pressing
the
unlit
tobacco
with
his
thumb
what
am
i
to
do
he
thought
can
he
notice
the
things
he
gave
me
a
parson
would
know
but
what
s
a
man
like
me
to
do
who
works
all
his
life
out
of
doors
as
he
wondered
the
silence
of
the
night
was
broken
the
whistle
of
pembroke
s
train
came
faintly
and
a
lurid
spot
passed
over
the
land
passed
and
the
silence
returned
one
thing
remained
that
a
man
of
his
sort
might
do
he
bent
down
reverently
and
saluted
the
child
to
whom
he
had
given
the
name
of
their
mother
