paths
of
intrigue
the
cliffs
rose
sheer
from
the
jungle
towering
ramparts
of
stone
that
glinted
and
dull
crimson
in
the
rising
sun
and
curved
away
and
away
to
east
and
west
above
the
waving
emerald
ocean
of
fronds
and
leaves
it
looked
insurmountable
that
giant
palisade
with
its
sheer
curtains
of
solid
rock
in
which
bits
of
quartz
winked
dazzlingly
in
the
sunlight
but
the
man
who
was
working
his
tedious
way
upward
was
already
halfway
to
the
top
he
came
of
a
race
of
hillmen
accustomed
to
scaling
forbidding
crags
and
he
was
a
man
of
unusual
strength
and
agility
his
only
garment
was
a
pair
of
short
red
silk
breeks
and
his
sandals
were
slung
to
his
back
out
of
his
way
as
were
his
sword
and
dagger
the
man
was
powerfully
built
supple
as
a
panther
his
skin
was
bronzed
by
the
sun
his
black
mane
confined
by
a
silver
band
about
his
temples
his
iron
muscles
quick
eyes
and
sure
feet
served
him
well
here
for
it
was
a
climb
to
test
these
qualities
to
the
utmost
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
below
him
waved
the
jungle
an
equal
distance
above
him
the
rim
of
the
cliffs
was
etched
against
the
morning
sky
he
labored
like
one
driven
by
the
necessity
of
haste
yet
he
was
forced
to
move
at
a
snail
pace
clinging
like
a
fly
on
a
wall
his
groping
hands
and
feet
found
niches
and
knobs
precarious
holds
at
best
and
sometimes
he
virtually
hung
by
his
finger
nails
yet
upward
he
went
clawing
squirming
fighting
for
every
foot
at
times
he
paused
to
rest
his
aching
muscles
and
shaking
the
sweat
out
of
his
eyes
twisted
his
head
to
stare
searchingly
out
over
the
jungle
combing
the
green
expanse
for
any
trace
of
human
life
or
motion
now
the
summit
was
not
far
above
him
and
he
observed
only
a
few
feet
above
his
head
a
break
in
the
sheer
stone
of
the
cliff
an
instant
later
he
had
reached
it
a
small
cavern
just
below
the
edge
of
the
rim
as
his
head
rose
above
the
lip
of
its
floor
he
grunted
he
clung
there
his
elbows
hooked
over
the
lip
the
cave
was
so
tiny
that
it
was
little
more
than
a
niche
cut
in
the
stone
but
held
an
occupant
a
shriveled
mummy
arms
folded
on
the
withered
breast
upon
which
the
shrunken
head
was
sunk
sat
in
the
little
cavern
the
limbs
were
bound
in
place
with
rawhide
thongs
which
had
become
mere
rotted
wisps
if
the
form
had
ever
been
clothed
the
ravages
of
time
had
long
ago
reduced
the
garments
to
dust
but
thrust
between
the
crossed
arms
and
the
shrunken
breast
there
was
a
roll
of
parchment
yellowed
with
age
to
the
color
of
old
ivory
the
climber
stretched
forth
a
long
arm
and
wrenched
away
this
cylinder
without
investigation
he
thrust
it
into
his
girdle
and
hauled
himself
up
until
he
was
standing
in
the
opening
of
the
niche
a
spring
upward
and
he
caught
the
rim
of
the
cliffs
and
pulled
himself
up
and
over
almost
with
the
same
motion
there
he
halted
panting
and
stared
downward
it
was
like
looking
into
the
interior
of
a
vast
bowl
rimmed
by
a
circular
stone
wall
the
floor
of
the
bowl
was
covered
with
trees
and
denser
vegetation
though
nowhere
did
the
growth
duplicate
the
jungle
denseness
of
the
outer
forest
the
cliffs
marched
around
it
without
a
break
and
of
uniform
height
it
was
a
freak
of
nature
not
to
be
paralleled
perhaps
in
the
whole
world
a
vast
natural
amphitheater
a
circular
bit
of
forested
plain
three
or
four
miles
in
diameter
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
world
and
confined
within
the
ring
of
those
palisaded
cliffs
but
the
man
on
the
cliffs
did
not
devote
his
thoughts
to
marveling
at
the
topographical
phenomenon
with
tense
eagerness
he
searched
the
below
him
and
exhaled
a
gusty
sigh
when
he
caught
the
glint
of
marble
domes
amidst
the
twinkling
green
it
was
no
myth
then
below
him
lay
the
fabulous
and
deserted
palace
of
alkmeenon
conan
the
cimmerian
late
of
the
baracha
isles
of
the
black
coast
and
of
many
other
climes
where
life
ran
wild
had
come
to
the
kingdom
of
keshan
following
the
lure
of
a
fabled
treasure
that
outshone
the
hoard
of
the
turanian
kings
keshan
was
a
barbaric
kingdom
lying
in
the
eastern
hinterlands
of
kush
where
the
broad
grasslands
merge
with
the
forests
that
roll
up
from
the
south
the
people
were
a
mixed
race
a
dusky
nobility
ruling
a
population
that
was
largely
pure
negro
the
rulers
princes
and
high
priests
claimed
descent
from
a
white
race
which
in
a
mythical
age
had
ruled
a
kingdom
whose
capital
city
was
alkmeenon
conflicting
legends
sought
to
explain
the
reason
for
that
race
eventual
downfall
and
the
abandonment
of
the
city
by
the
survivors
equally
nebulous
were
the
tales
of
the
teeth
of
gwahlur
the
treasure
of
alkmeenon
but
these
misty
legends
had
been
enough
to
bring
conan
to
keshan
over
vast
distances
of
plain
jungle
and
mountains
he
had
found
keshan
which
in
itself
was
considered
mythical
by
many
northern
and
western
nations
and
he
had
heard
enough
to
confirm
the
rumors
of
the
treasure
that
men
called
the
teeth
of
gwahlur
but
its
he
could
not
learn
and
he
was
confronted
with
the
necessity
of
explaining
his
presence
in
keshan
unattached
strangers
were
not
welcome
there
but
he
was
not
nonplussed
with
cool
assurance
he
made
his
offer
to
the
stately
plumed
suspicious
grandees
of
the
barbarically
magnificent
court
he
was
a
professional
in
search
of
employment
he
said
he
had
come
to
keshan
for
a
price
he
would
train
the
armies
of
keshan
and
lead
them
against
punt
their
hereditary
enemy
whose
recent
successes
in
the
field
had
aroused
the
fury
of
keshan
irascible
king
this
proposition
was
not
so
audacious
as
it
might
seem
conan
fame
had
preceded
him
even
into
distant
keshan
his
exploits
as
a
chief
of
the
black
corsairs
those
wolves
of
the
southern
coasts
had
made
his
name
known
admired
and
feared
throughout
the
black
kingdoms
he
did
not
refuse
tests
devised
by
the
dusky
lords
skirmishes
along
the
borders
were
incessant
affording
the
cimmerian
plenty
of
opportunities
to
demonstrate
his
ability
at
fighting
his
reckless
ferocity
impressed
the
lords
of
keshan
already
aware
of
his
reputation
as
a
leader
of
men
and
the
prospects
seemed
favorable
all
conan
secretly
desired
was
employment
to
give
him
legitimate
excuse
for
remaining
in
keshan
long
enough
to
locate
the
of
the
teeth
of
gwahlur
then
there
came
an
interruption
thutmekri
came
to
keshan
at
the
head
of
an
embassy
from
zembabwei
thutmekri
was
a
stygian
an
adventurer
and
a
rogue
whose
wits
had
recommended
him
to
the
twin
kings
of
the
great
hybrid
trading
kingdom
which
lay
many
days
march
to
the
east
he
and
the
cimmerian
knew
each
other
of
old
and
without
love
thutmekri
likewise
had
a
proposition
to
make
to
the
king
of
keshan
and
it
also
concerned
the
conquest
of
punt
which
kingdom
incidentally
lying
east
of
keshan
had
recently
expelled
the
zembabwan
traders
and
burned
their
fortresses
his
offer
outweighed
even
the
prestige
of
conan
he
pledged
himself
to
invade
punt
from
the
east
with
a
host
of
black
spearmen
shemitish
archers
and
mercenary
swordsmen
and
to
aid
the
king
of
keshan
to
annex
the
hostile
kingdom
the
benevolent
kings
of
zembabwei
desired
only
a
monopoly
of
the
trade
of
keshan
and
her
tributaries
and
as
a
pledge
of
good
faith
some
of
the
teeth
of
gwahlur
these
would
be
put
to
no
base
usage
thutmekri
hastened
to
explain
to
the
suspicious
chieftains
they
would
be
placed
in
the
temple
of
zembabwei
beside
the
squat
gold
idols
of
dagon
and
derketo
sacred
guests
in
the
holy
shrine
of
the
kingdom
to
seal
the
covenant
between
keshan
and
zembabwei
this
statement
brought
a
savage
grin
to
conan
hard
lips
the
cimmerian
made
no
attempt
to
match
wits
and
intrigue
with
thutmekri
and
his
shemitish
partner
zargheba
he
knew
that
if
thutmekri
won
his
point
he
would
insist
on
the
instant
banishment
of
his
rival
there
was
but
one
thing
for
conan
to
do
find
the
jewels
before
the
king
of
keshan
made
up
his
mind
and
flee
with
them
but
by
this
time
he
was
certain
that
they
were
not
hidden
in
keshia
the
royal
city
which
was
a
swarm
of
thatched
huts
crowding
about
a
mud
wall
that
enclosed
a
palace
of
stone
and
mud
and
bamboo
while
he
fumed
with
nervous
impatience
the
high
priest
gorulga
announced
that
before
any
decision
could
be
reached
the
will
of
the
gods
must
be
ascertained
concerning
the
proposed
alliance
with
zembabwei
and
the
pledge
of
objects
long
held
holy
and
inviolate
the
oracle
of
alkmeenon
must
be
consulted
this
was
an
awesome
thing
and
it
caused
tongues
to
wag
excitedly
in
palace
and
hut
not
for
a
century
had
the
priests
visited
the
silent
city
the
oracle
men
said
was
the
princess
yelaya
the
last
ruler
of
alkmeenon
who
had
died
in
the
full
bloom
of
her
youth
and
beauty
and
whose
body
had
miraculously
remained
unblemished
throughout
the
ages
of
old
priests
had
made
their
way
into
the
haunted
city
and
she
had
taught
them
wisdom
the
last
priest
to
seek
the
oracle
had
been
a
wicked
man
who
had
sought
to
steal
for
himself
the
curiously
cut
jewels
that
men
called
the
teeth
of
gwahlur
but
some
doom
had
come
upon
him
in
the
deserted
palace
from
which
his
acolytes
fleeing
had
told
tales
of
horror
that
had
for
a
hundred
years
frightened
the
priests
from
the
city
and
the
oracle
but
gorulga
the
present
high
priest
as
one
confident
in
his
knowledge
of
his
own
integrity
announced
that
he
would
go
with
a
handful
of
followers
to
revive
the
ancient
custom
and
in
the
excitement
tongues
buzzed
indiscreetly
and
conan
caught
the
clue
for
which
he
had
sought
for
weeks
the
overheard
whisper
of
a
lesser
priest
that
sent
the
cimmerian
stealing
out
of
keshia
the
night
before
the
dawn
when
the
priests
were
to
start
riding
as
hard
as
he
dared
for
a
night
and
a
day
and
a
night
he
came
in
the
early
dawn
to
the
cliffs
of
alkmeenon
which
stood
in
the
southwestern
corner
of
the
kingdom
amidst
uninhabited
jungle
which
was
taboo
to
common
men
none
but
the
priests
dared
approach
the
haunted
vale
within
a
distance
of
many
miles
and
not
even
a
priest
had
entered
alkmeenon
for
a
hundred
years
no
man
had
ever
climbed
these
cliffs
legends
said
and
none
but
the
priests
knew
the
secret
entrance
into
the
valley
conan
did
not
waste
time
looking
for
it
steeps
that
balked
these
people
horsemen
and
dwellers
of
plain
and
level
forest
were
not
impossible
for
a
man
born
in
the
rugged
hills
of
cimmeria
now
on
the
summit
of
the
cliffs
he
looked
down
into
the
circular
valley
and
wondered
what
plague
war
or
superstition
had
driven
the
members
of
that
ancient
race
forth
from
their
stronghold
to
mingle
with
and
be
absorbed
by
the
tribes
that
hemmed
them
in
this
valley
had
been
their
citadel
there
the
palace
stood
and
there
only
the
royal
family
and
their
court
dwelt
the
real
city
stood
outside
the
cliffs
those
waving
masses
of
green
jungle
vegetation
hid
its
ruins
but
the
domes
that
glistened
in
the
leaves
below
him
were
the
unbroken
pinnacles
of
the
royal
palace
of
alkmeenon
which
had
defied
the
corroding
ages
swinging
a
leg
over
the
rim
he
went
down
swiftly
the
inner
side
of
the
cliffs
was
more
broken
not
quite
so
sheer
in
less
than
half
the
time
it
had
taken
him
to
ascend
the
outer
side
he
dropped
to
the
swarded
valley
floor
with
one
hand
on
his
sword
he
looked
alertly
about
him
there
was
no
reason
to
suppose
men
lied
when
they
said
that
alkmeenon
was
empty
and
deserted
haunted
only
by
the
ghosts
of
the
dead
past
but
it
was
conan
nature
to
be
suspicious
and
wary
the
silence
was
primordial
not
even
a
leaf
quivered
on
a
branch
when
he
bent
to
peer
under
the
trees
he
saw
nothing
but
the
marching
rows
of
trunks
receding
and
receding
into
the
blue
gloom
of
the
deep
woods
nevertheless
he
went
warily
sword
in
hand
his
restless
eyes
combing
the
shadows
from
side
to
side
his
springy
tread
making
no
sound
on
the
sward
all
about
him
he
saw
signs
of
an
ancient
civilization
marble
fountains
voiceless
and
crumbling
stood
in
circles
of
slender
trees
whose
patterns
were
too
symmetrical
to
have
been
a
chance
of
nature
and
underbrush
had
invaded
the
evenly
planned
groves
but
their
outlines
were
still
visible
broad
pavements
ran
away
under
the
trees
broken
and
with
grass
growing
through
the
wide
cracks
he
glimpsed
walls
with
ornamental
copings
lattices
of
carven
stone
that
might
once
have
served
as
the
walls
of
pleasure
pavilions
ahead
of
him
through
the
trees
the
domes
gleamed
and
the
bulk
of
the
structure
supporting
them
became
more
apparent
as
he
advanced
presently
pushing
through
a
screen
of
branches
he
came
into
a
comparatively
open
space
where
the
trees
straggled
unencumbered
by
undergrowth
and
saw
before
him
the
wide
pillared
portico
of
the
palace
as
he
mounted
the
broad
marble
steps
he
noted
that
the
building
was
in
far
better
state
of
preservation
than
the
lesser
structures
he
had
glimpsed
the
thick
walls
and
massive
pillars
seemed
too
powerful
to
crumble
before
the
assault
of
time
and
the
elements
the
same
enchanted
quiet
brooded
over
all
the
pad
of
his
sandaled
feet
seemed
startlingly
loud
in
the
stillness
somewhere
in
this
palace
lay
the
effigy
or
image
which
had
in
times
past
served
as
oracle
for
the
priests
of
keshan
and
somewhere
in
the
palace
unless
that
indiscreet
priest
had
babbled
a
lie
was
hidden
the
treasure
of
the
forgotten
kings
of
alkmeenon
conan
passed
into
a
broad
lofty
hall
lined
with
tall
columns
between
which
arches
gaped
their
door
long
rotted
away
he
traversed
this
in
a
twilight
dimness
and
at
the
other
end
passed
through
great
bronze
doors
which
stood
partly
open
as
they
might
have
stood
for
centuries
he
emerged
into
a
vast
domed
chamber
which
must
have
served
as
audience
hall
for
the
kings
of
alkmeenon
it
was
octagonal
in
shape
and
the
great
dome
up
to
which
the
lofty
ceiling
curved
obviously
was
cunningly
pierced
for
the
chamber
was
much
better
lighted
than
the
hall
which
led
to
it
at
the
farther
side
of
the
great
room
there
rose
a
dais
with
broad
steps
leading
up
to
it
and
on
that
dais
there
stood
a
massive
chair
with
ornate
arms
and
a
high
back
which
once
doubtless
supported
a
canopy
conan
grunted
explosively
and
his
eyes
lit
the
golden
throne
of
alkmeenon
named
in
immemorial
legendry
he
weighed
it
with
a
practised
eye
it
represented
a
fortune
in
itself
if
he
were
but
able
to
bear
it
away
its
richness
fired
his
imagination
concerning
the
treasure
itself
and
made
him
burn
with
eagerness
his
fingers
itched
to
plunge
among
the
gems
he
had
heard
described
by
in
the
market
squares
of
keshia
who
repeated
tales
handed
down
from
mouth
to
mouth
through
the
centuries
jewels
not
to
be
duplicated
in
the
world
rubies
emeralds
diamonds
bloodstones
opals
sapphires
the
loot
of
the
ancient
world
he
had
expected
to
find
the
seated
on
the
throne
but
since
it
was
not
it
was
probably
placed
in
some
other
part
of
the
palace
if
indeed
such
a
thing
really
existed
but
since
he
had
turned
his
face
toward
keshan
so
many
myths
had
proved
to
be
realities
that
he
did
not
doubt
that
he
would
find
some
kind
of
image
or
god
behind
the
throne
there
was
a
narrow
arched
doorway
which
doubtless
had
been
masked
by
hangings
in
the
days
of
alkmeenon
life
he
glanced
through
it
and
saw
that
it
let
into
an
alcove
empty
and
with
a
narrow
corridor
leading
off
from
it
at
right
angles
turning
away
from
it
he
spied
another
arch
to
the
left
of
the
dais
and
it
unlike
the
others
was
furnished
with
a
door
nor
was
it
any
common
door
the
portal
was
of
the
same
rich
metal
as
the
throne
and
carved
with
many
curious
arabesques
at
his
touch
it
swung
open
so
readily
that
its
hinges
might
recently
have
been
oiled
inside
he
halted
staring
he
was
in
a
square
chamber
of
no
great
dimensions
whose
marble
walls
rose
to
an
ornate
ceiling
inlaid
with
gold
gold
friezes
ran
about
the
base
and
the
top
of
the
walls
and
there
was
no
door
other
than
the
one
through
which
he
had
entered
but
he
noted
these
details
mechanically
his
whole
attention
was
centered
on
the
shape
which
lay
on
an
ivory
dais
before
him
he
had
expected
an
image
probably
carved
with
the
skill
of
a
forgotten
art
but
no
art
could
mimic
the
perfection
of
the
figure
that
lay
before
him
it
was
no
effigy
of
stone
or
metal
or
ivory
it
was
the
actual
body
of
a
woman
and
by
what
dark
art
the
ancients
had
preserved
that
form
unblemished
for
so
many
ages
conan
could
not
even
guess
the
very
garments
she
wore
were
intact
and
conan
scowled
at
that
a
vague
uneasiness
stirring
at
the
back
of
his
mind
the
arts
that
preserved
the
body
should
not
have
affected
the
garments
yet
there
they
were
gold
set
with
concentric
circles
of
small
gems
gilded
sandals
and
a
short
silken
skirt
upheld
by
a
jeweled
girdle
neither
cloth
nor
metal
showed
any
signs
of
decay
yelaya
was
coldly
beautiful
even
in
death
her
body
was
like
alabaster
slender
yet
voluptuous
a
great
crimson
jewel
gleamed
against
the
darkly
piled
foam
of
her
hair
conan
stood
frowning
down
at
her
and
then
tapped
the
dais
with
his
sword
possibilities
of
a
hollow
containing
the
treasure
occurred
to
him
but
the
dais
rang
solid
he
turned
and
paced
the
chamber
in
some
indecision
where
should
he
search
first
in
the
limited
time
at
his
disposal
the
priest
he
had
overheard
babbling
to
a
courtesan
had
said
the
treasure
was
hidden
in
the
palace
but
that
included
a
space
of
considerable
vastness
he
wondered
if
he
should
hide
himself
until
the
priests
had
come
and
gone
and
then
renew
the
search
but
there
was
a
strong
chance
that
they
might
take
the
jewels
with
them
when
they
returned
to
keshia
for
he
was
convinced
that
thutmekri
had
corrupted
gorulga
conan
could
predict
thutmekri
plans
from
his
knowledge
of
the
man
he
knew
that
it
had
been
thutmekri
who
had
proposed
the
conquest
of
punt
to
the
kings
of
zembabwei
which
conquest
was
but
one
move
toward
their
real
goal
the
capture
of
the
teeth
of
gwahlur
those
wary
kings
would
demand
proof
that
the
treasure
really
existed
before
they
made
any
move
the
jewels
thutmekri
asked
as
a
pledge
would
furnish
that
proof
with
positive
evidence
of
the
treasure
reality
the
kings
of
zembabwei
would
move
punt
would
be
invaded
simultaneously
from
the
east
and
the
west
but
the
zembabwans
would
see
to
it
that
the
keshani
did
most
of
the
fighting
and
then
when
both
punt
and
keshan
were
exhausted
from
the
struggle
the
zembabwans
would
crush
both
races
loot
keshan
and
take
the
treasure
by
force
if
they
had
to
destroy
every
building
and
torture
every
living
human
in
the
kingdom
but
there
was
always
another
possibility
if
thutmekri
could
get
his
hands
on
the
hoard
it
would
be
characteristic
of
the
man
to
cheat
his
employers
steal
the
jewels
for
himself
and
decamp
leaving
the
zembabwan
emissaries
holding
the
sack
conan
believed
that
this
consulting
of
the
oracle
was
but
a
ruse
to
persuade
the
king
of
keshan
to
accede
to
thutmekri
wishes
for
he
never
for
a
moment
doubted
that
gorulga
was
as
subtle
and
devious
as
all
the
rest
mixed
up
in
this
grand
swindle
conan
had
not
approached
the
high
priest
himself
because
in
the
game
of
bribery
he
would
have
no
chance
against
thutmekri
and
to
attempt
it
would
be
to
play
directly
into
the
stygian
hands
gorulga
could
denounce
the
cimmerian
to
the
people
establish
a
reputation
for
integrity
and
rid
thutmekri
of
his
rival
at
one
stroke
he
wondered
how
thutmekri
had
corrupted
the
high
priest
and
just
what
could
be
offered
as
a
bribe
to
a
man
who
had
the
greatest
treasure
in
the
world
under
his
fingers
at
any
rate
he
was
sure
that
the
oracle
would
be
made
to
say
that
the
gods
willed
it
that
keshan
should
follow
thutmekri
wishes
and
he
was
sure
too
that
it
would
drop
a
few
pointed
remarks
concerning
himself
after
that
keshia
would
be
too
hot
for
the
cimmerian
nor
had
conan
had
any
intention
of
returning
when
he
rode
away
in
the
night
the
oracle
chamber
held
no
clue
for
him
he
went
forth
into
the
great
and
laid
his
hands
on
the
throne
it
was
heavy
but
he
could
tilt
it
up
the
floor
beneath
a
thick
marble
dais
was
solid
again
he
sought
the
alcove
his
mind
clung
to
a
secret
crypt
near
the
oracle
painstakingly
he
began
to
tap
along
the
walls
and
presently
his
taps
rang
hollow
at
a
spot
opposite
the
mouth
of
the
narrow
corridor
looking
more
closely
he
saw
that
the
crack
between
the
marble
panel
at
that
point
and
the
next
was
wider
than
usual
he
inserted
a
and
pried
silently
the
panel
swung
open
revealing
a
niche
in
the
wall
but
nothing
else
he
swore
feelingly
the
aperture
was
empty
and
it
did
not
look
as
if
it
had
ever
served
as
a
crypt
for
treasure
leaning
into
the
niche
he
saw
a
system
of
tiny
holes
in
the
wall
about
on
a
level
with
a
man
mouth
he
peered
through
and
grunted
understandingly
that
was
the
wall
that
formed
the
partition
between
the
alcove
and
the
oracle
chamber
those
holes
had
not
been
visible
in
the
chamber
conan
grinned
this
explained
the
mystery
of
the
oracle
but
it
was
a
bit
cruder
than
he
had
expected
gorulga
would
plant
either
himself
or
some
trusted
minion
in
that
niche
to
talk
through
the
holes
and
the
credulous
acolytes
would
accept
it
as
the
veritable
voice
of
yelaya
remembering
something
the
cimmerian
drew
forth
the
roll
of
parchment
he
had
taken
from
the
mummy
and
unrolled
it
carefully
as
it
seemed
ready
to
fall
to
pieces
with
age
he
scowled
over
the
dim
characters
with
which
it
was
covered
in
his
roaming
about
the
world
the
giant
adventurer
had
picked
up
a
wide
smattering
of
knowledge
particularly
including
the
speaking
and
reading
of
many
alien
tongues
many
a
sheltered
scholar
would
have
been
astonished
at
the
linguistic
abilities
for
he
had
experienced
many
adventures
where
knowledge
of
a
strange
language
had
meant
the
difference
between
life
and
death
these
characters
were
puzzling
at
once
familiar
and
unintelligible
and
presently
he
discovered
the
reason
they
were
the
characters
of
archaic
pelishtim
which
possessed
many
points
of
difference
from
the
modern
script
with
which
he
was
familiar
and
which
three
centuries
ago
had
been
modified
by
conquest
by
a
nomad
tribe
this
older
purer
script
baffled
him
he
made
out
a
recurrent
phrase
however
which
he
recognized
as
a
proper
name
he
gathered
that
it
was
the
name
of
the
writer
scowling
his
lips
unconsciously
moving
as
he
struggled
with
the
task
he
blundered
through
the
manuscript
finding
much
of
it
untranslatable
and
most
of
the
rest
of
it
obscure
he
gathered
that
the
writer
the
mysterious
had
come
from
afar
with
his
servants
and
entered
the
valley
of
alkmeenon
much
that
followed
was
meaningless
interspersed
as
it
was
with
unfamiliar
phrases
and
characters
such
as
he
could
translate
seemed
to
indicate
the
passing
of
a
very
long
period
of
time
the
name
of
yelaya
was
repeated
frequently
and
toward
the
last
part
of
the
manuscript
it
became
apparent
that
knew
that
death
was
upon
him
with
a
slight
start
conan
realized
that
the
mummy
in
the
cavern
must
be
the
remains
of
the
writer
of
the
manuscript
the
mysterious
pelishtim
the
man
had
died
as
he
had
prophesied
and
his
servants
obviously
had
placed
him
in
that
open
crypt
high
up
on
the
cliffs
according
to
his
instructions
before
his
death
it
was
strange
that
was
not
mentioned
in
any
of
the
legends
of
alkmeenon
obviously
he
had
come
to
the
valley
after
it
had
been
deserted
by
the
original
inhabitants
the
manuscript
indicated
as
much
but
it
seemed
peculiar
that
the
priests
who
came
in
the
old
days
to
consult
the
oracle
had
not
seen
the
man
or
his
servants
conan
felt
sure
that
the
mummy
and
this
parchment
were
more
than
a
hundred
years
old
had
dwelt
in
the
valley
when
the
priests
came
of
old
to
bow
before
dead
yelaya
yet
concerning
him
the
legends
were
silent
telling
only
of
a
deserted
city
haunted
only
by
the
dead
why
had
the
man
dwelt
in
this
desolate
spot
and
to
what
unknown
destination
had
his
servants
departed
after
disposing
of
their
corpse
conan
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
thrust
the
parchment
back
into
his
girdle
he
started
violently
the
skin
on
the
backs
of
his
hands
tingling
startlingly
shockingly
in
the
slumberous
stillness
there
had
boomed
the
deep
strident
clangor
of
a
great
gong
he
wheeled
crouching
like
a
great
cat
sword
in
hand
glaring
down
the
narrow
corridor
from
which
the
sound
had
seemed
to
come
had
the
priests
of
keshia
arrived
this
was
improbable
he
knew
they
would
not
have
had
time
to
reach
the
valley
but
that
gong
was
indisputable
evidence
of
human
presence
conan
was
basically
a
such
subtlety
as
he
possessed
had
been
acquired
through
contact
with
the
more
devious
races
when
taken
off
guard
by
some
unexpected
occurrence
he
reverted
instinctively
to
type
so
now
instead
of
hiding
or
slipping
away
in
the
opposite
direction
as
the
average
man
might
have
done
he
ran
straight
down
the
corridor
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
his
sandals
made
no
more
sound
than
the
pads
of
a
panther
would
have
made
his
eyes
were
slits
his
lips
unconsciously
asnarl
panic
had
momentarily
touched
his
soul
at
the
shock
of
that
unexpected
reverberation
and
the
red
rage
of
the
primitive
that
is
wakened
by
threat
of
peril
always
lurked
close
to
the
surface
of
the
cimmerian
he
emerged
presently
from
the
winding
corridor
into
a
small
open
court
something
glinting
in
the
sun
caught
his
eye
it
was
the
gong
a
great
gold
disk
hanging
from
a
gold
arm
extending
from
the
crumbling
wall
a
brass
mallet
lay
near
but
there
was
no
sound
or
sight
of
humanity
the
surrounding
arches
gaped
emptily
conan
crouched
inside
the
doorway
for
what
seemed
a
long
time
there
was
no
sound
or
movement
throughout
the
great
palace
his
patience
exhausted
at
last
he
glided
around
the
curve
of
the
court
peering
into
the
arches
ready
to
leap
either
way
like
a
flash
of
light
or
to
strike
right
or
left
as
a
cobra
strikes
he
reached
the
gong
stared
into
the
arch
nearest
it
he
saw
only
a
dim
chamber
littered
with
the
debris
of
decay
beneath
the
gong
the
polished
marble
flags
showed
no
footprints
but
there
was
a
scent
in
the
air
a
faintly
fetid
odor
he
could
not
classify
his
nostrils
dilated
like
those
of
a
wild
beast
as
he
sought
in
vain
to
identify
it
he
turned
toward
the
arch
with
appalling
suddenness
the
seemingly
solid
flags
splintered
and
gave
way
under
his
feet
even
as
he
fell
he
spread
wide
his
arms
and
caught
the
edges
of
the
aperture
that
gaped
beneath
him
the
edges
crumbled
off
under
his
clutching
fingers
down
into
utter
darkness
he
shot
into
black
icy
water
that
gripped
him
and
whirled
him
away
with
breathless
speed
a
goddess
awakens
the
cimmerian
at
first
made
no
attempt
to
fight
the
current
that
was
sweeping
him
through
lightless
night
he
kept
himself
afloat
gripping
between
his
teeth
the
sword
which
he
had
not
relinquished
even
in
his
fall
and
did
not
even
seek
to
guess
to
what
doom
he
was
being
borne
but
suddenly
a
beam
of
light
lanced
the
darkness
ahead
of
him
he
saw
the
surging
seething
black
surface
of
the
water
in
turmoil
as
if
disturbed
by
some
monster
of
the
deep
and
he
saw
the
sheer
stone
walls
of
the
channel
curved
up
to
a
vault
overhead
on
each
side
ran
a
narrow
ledge
just
below
the
arching
roof
but
they
were
far
out
of
his
reach
at
one
point
this
roof
had
been
broken
probably
fallen
in
and
the
light
was
streaming
through
the
aperture
beyond
that
shaft
of
light
was
utter
blackness
and
panic
assailed
the
cimmerian
as
he
saw
he
would
be
swept
on
past
that
spot
of
light
and
into
the
unknown
blackness
again
then
he
saw
something
else
bronze
ladders
extended
from
the
ledges
to
the
water
surface
at
regular
intervals
and
there
was
one
just
ahead
of
him
instantly
he
struck
out
for
it
fighting
the
current
that
would
have
held
him
to
the
middle
of
the
stream
it
dragged
at
him
as
with
tangible
animate
slimy
hands
but
he
buffeted
the
rushing
surge
with
the
strength
of
desperation
and
now
drew
closer
and
closer
inshore
fighting
furiously
for
every
inch
now
he
was
even
with
the
ladder
and
with
a
fierce
gasping
plunge
he
gripped
the
bottom
rung
and
hung
on
breathless
a
few
seconds
later
he
struggled
up
out
of
the
seething
water
trusting
his
weight
dubiously
to
the
corroded
rungs
they
sagged
and
bent
but
they
held
and
he
clambered
up
onto
the
narrow
ledge
which
ran
along
the
wall
scarcely
a
man
length
below
the
curving
roof
the
tall
cimmerian
was
forced
to
bend
his
head
as
he
stood
up
a
heavy
bronze
door
showed
in
the
stone
at
a
point
even
with
the
head
of
the
ladder
but
it
did
not
give
to
conan
efforts
he
transferred
his
sword
from
his
teeth
to
its
scabbard
spitting
blood
for
the
edge
had
cut
his
lips
in
that
fierce
fight
with
the
river
and
turned
his
attention
to
the
broken
roof
he
could
reach
his
arms
up
through
the
crevice
and
grip
the
edge
and
careful
testing
told
him
it
would
bear
his
weight
an
instant
later
he
had
drawn
himself
up
through
the
hole
and
found
himself
in
a
wide
chamber
in
a
state
of
extreme
disrepair
most
of
the
roof
had
fallen
in
as
well
as
a
great
section
of
the
floor
which
was
laid
over
the
vault
of
a
subterranean
river
broken
arches
opened
into
other
chambers
and
corridors
and
conan
believed
he
was
still
in
the
great
palace
he
wondered
uneasily
how
many
chambers
in
that
palace
had
underground
water
directly
under
them
and
when
the
ancient
flags
or
tiles
might
give
way
again
and
precipitate
him
back
into
the
current
from
which
he
had
just
crawled
and
he
wondered
just
how
much
of
an
accident
that
fall
had
been
had
those
rotten
flags
simply
chanced
to
give
way
beneath
his
weight
or
was
there
a
more
sinister
explanation
one
thing
at
least
was
obvious
he
was
not
the
only
living
thing
in
that
palace
that
gong
had
not
sounded
of
its
own
accord
whether
the
noise
had
been
meant
to
lure
him
to
his
death
or
not
the
silence
of
the
palace
became
suddenly
sinister
fraught
with
crawling
menace
could
it
be
someone
on
the
same
mission
as
himself
a
sudden
thought
occurred
to
him
at
the
memory
of
the
mysterious
was
it
not
possible
that
this
man
had
found
the
teeth
of
gwahlur
in
his
long
residence
in
alkmeenon
that
his
servants
had
taken
them
with
them
when
they
departed
the
possibility
that
he
might
be
following
a
infuriated
the
cimmerian
choosing
a
corridor
which
he
believed
led
back
toward
the
part
of
the
palace
he
had
first
entered
he
hurried
along
it
stepping
gingerly
as
he
thought
of
that
black
river
that
seethed
and
foamed
somewhere
below
his
feet
his
speculations
recurrently
revolved
about
the
oracle
chamber
and
its
cryptic
occupant
somewhere
in
that
vicinity
must
be
the
clue
to
the
mystery
of
the
treasure
if
indeed
it
still
remained
in
its
immemorial
the
great
palace
lay
silent
as
ever
disturbed
only
by
the
swift
passing
of
his
sandaled
feet
the
chambers
and
halls
he
traversed
were
crumbling
into
ruin
but
as
he
advanced
the
ravages
of
decay
became
less
apparent
he
wondered
briefly
for
what
purpose
the
ladders
had
been
suspended
from
the
ledges
over
the
subterranean
river
but
dismissed
the
matter
with
a
shrug
he
was
little
interested
in
speculating
over
unremunerative
problems
of
antiquity
he
was
not
sure
just
where
the
oracle
chamber
lay
from
where
he
was
but
presently
he
emerged
into
a
corridor
which
led
back
into
the
great
under
one
of
the
arches
he
had
reached
a
decision
it
was
useless
for
him
to
wander
aimlessly
about
the
palace
seeking
the
hoard
he
would
conceal
himself
somewhere
here
wait
until
the
keshani
priests
came
and
then
after
they
had
gone
through
the
farce
of
consulting
the
oracle
he
would
follow
them
to
the
of
the
gems
to
which
he
was
certain
they
would
go
perhaps
they
would
take
only
a
few
of
the
jewels
with
them
he
would
content
himself
with
the
rest
drawn
by
a
morbid
fascination
he
the
oracle
chamber
and
stared
down
again
at
the
motionless
figure
of
the
princess
who
was
worshipped
as
a
goddess
entranced
by
her
frigid
beauty
what
cryptic
secret
was
locked
in
that
marvelously
molded
form
he
started
violently
the
breath
sucked
through
his
teeth
the
short
hairs
prickled
at
the
back
of
his
scalp
the
body
still
lay
as
he
had
first
seen
it
silent
motionless
in
of
jeweled
gold
gilded
sandals
and
silken
shirt
but
now
there
was
a
subtle
difference
the
lissom
limbs
were
not
rigid
a
touched
the
cheeks
the
lips
were
red
with
a
panicky
curse
conan
ripped
out
his
sword
she
alive
at
his
words
the
long
dark
lashes
lifted
the
eyes
opened
and
gaped
up
at
him
inscrutably
dark
lustrous
mystical
he
glared
in
frozen
speechlessness
she
sat
up
with
a
supple
ease
still
holding
his
ensorceled
stare
he
licked
his
dry
lips
and
found
voice
are
are
you
yelaya
he
stammered
am
yelaya
the
voice
was
rich
and
musical
and
he
stared
with
new
wonder
not
fear
i
will
not
harm
you
if
you
do
my
bidding
can
a
dead
woman
come
to
life
after
all
these
centuries
he
demanded
as
if
skeptical
of
what
his
senses
told
him
a
curious
gleam
was
beginning
to
smolder
in
his
eyes
she
lifted
her
arms
in
a
mystical
gesture
am
a
goddess
a
thousand
years
ago
there
descended
upon
me
the
curse
of
the
greater
gods
the
gods
of
darkness
beyond
the
borders
of
light
the
mortal
in
me
died
the
goddess
in
me
could
never
die
here
i
have
lain
for
so
many
centuries
to
awaken
each
night
at
sunset
and
hold
my
court
as
of
yore
with
specters
drawn
from
the
shadows
of
the
past
man
if
you
would
not
view
that
which
will
blast
your
soul
for
ever
get
hence
quickly
i
command
you
go
the
voice
became
imperious
and
her
slender
arm
lifted
and
pointed
conan
his
eyes
burning
slits
slowly
sheathed
his
sword
but
he
did
not
obey
her
order
he
stepped
closer
as
if
impelled
by
a
powerful
fascination
without
the
slightest
warning
he
grabbed
her
up
in
a
grasp
she
screamed
a
very
scream
and
there
was
a
sound
of
ripping
silk
as
with
one
ruthless
wrench
he
tore
off
her
skirt
ha
his
bark
was
full
of
angry
contempt
he
ignored
the
frantic
writhings
of
his
captive
thought
it
was
strange
that
a
princess
of
alkmeenon
would
speak
with
a
corinthian
accent
as
soon
as
i
gathered
my
wits
i
knew
i
seen
you
somewhere
you
muriela
zargheba
corinthian
this
birthmark
on
your
hip
proves
it
i
saw
it
once
when
zargheba
was
whipping
you
goddess
bah
he
smacked
the
betraying
hip
contemptuously
and
resoundingly
with
his
open
hand
and
the
girl
yelped
piteously
all
her
imperiousness
had
gone
out
of
her
she
was
no
longer
a
mystical
figure
of
antiquity
but
a
terrified
and
humiliated
such
as
can
be
bought
at
almost
any
shemitish
she
lifted
up
her
voice
and
wept
unashamedly
her
captor
glared
down
at
her
with
angry
triumph
ha
so
you
were
one
of
the
veiled
women
zargheba
brought
to
keshia
with
him
did
you
think
you
could
fool
me
you
little
idiot
a
year
ago
i
saw
you
in
akbitana
with
that
swine
zargheba
and
i
forget
faces
or
women
figures
i
think
i
squirming
about
in
his
grasp
she
threw
her
slender
arms
about
his
massive
neck
in
an
abandon
of
terror
tears
coursed
down
her
cheeks
and
her
sobs
quivered
with
a
note
of
hysteria
please
do
hurt
me
do
i
had
to
do
it
zargheba
brought
me
here
to
act
as
the
oracle
you
sacrilegious
little
hussy
rumbled
conan
you
not
fear
the
gods
crom
is
there
no
honesty
anywhere
please
she
begged
quivering
with
abject
fright
disobey
zargheba
oh
what
shall
i
do
i
shall
be
cursed
by
these
heathen
gods
do
you
think
the
priests
will
do
to
you
if
they
find
out
you
an
impostor
he
demanded
at
the
thought
her
legs
refused
to
support
her
and
she
collapsed
in
a
shuddering
heap
clasping
conan
knees
and
mingling
incoherent
pleas
for
mercy
and
protection
with
piteous
protestations
of
her
innocence
of
any
malign
intention
it
was
a
vivid
change
from
her
pose
as
the
ancient
princess
but
not
surprising
the
fear
that
had
nerved
her
then
was
now
her
undoing
is
zargheba
he
demanded
yammering
damn
it
and
answer
me
the
palace
she
whimpered
for
the
priests
many
men
with
him
we
came
alone
it
was
much
like
the
satisfied
grunt
of
a
hunting
lion
must
have
left
keshia
a
few
hours
after
i
did
did
you
climb
the
cliffs
she
shook
her
head
too
choked
with
tears
to
speak
coherently
with
an
impatient
imprecation
he
seized
her
slim
shoulders
and
shook
her
until
she
gasped
for
breath
you
quit
that
blubbering
and
answer
me
how
did
you
get
into
the
valley
knew
the
secret
way
she
gasped
priest
gwarunga
told
him
and
thutmekri
on
the
south
side
of
the
valley
there
is
a
broad
pool
lying
at
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
there
is
a
under
the
surface
of
the
water
that
is
not
visible
to
the
casual
glance
we
ducked
under
the
water
and
entered
it
the
cave
slopes
up
out
of
the
water
swiftly
and
leads
through
the
cliffs
the
opening
on
the
side
of
the
valley
is
masked
by
heavy
thickets
climbed
the
cliffs
on
the
east
side
he
muttered
what
then
came
to
the
palace
and
zargheba
hid
me
among
the
trees
while
he
went
to
look
for
the
chamber
of
the
oracle
i
do
not
think
he
fully
trusted
gwarunga
while
he
was
gone
i
thought
i
heard
a
gong
sound
but
i
was
not
sure
presently
zargheba
came
and
took
me
into
the
palace
and
brought
me
to
this
chamber
where
the
goddess
yelaya
lay
upon
the
dais
he
stripped
the
body
and
clothed
me
in
the
garments
and
ornaments
then
he
went
forth
to
hide
the
body
and
watch
for
the
priests
i
have
been
afraid
when
you
entered
i
wanted
to
leap
up
and
beg
you
to
take
me
away
from
this
place
but
i
feared
zargheba
when
you
discovered
i
was
alive
i
thought
i
could
frighten
you
away
were
you
to
say
as
the
oracle
he
asked
was
to
bid
the
priests
to
take
the
teeth
of
gwahlur
and
give
some
of
them
to
thutmekri
as
a
pledge
as
he
desired
and
place
the
rest
in
the
palace
at
keshia
i
was
to
tell
them
that
an
awful
doom
threatened
keshan
if
they
did
not
agree
to
thutmekri
proposals
and
oh
yes
i
was
to
tell
them
that
you
were
to
be
skinned
alive
immediately
wanted
the
treasure
where
he
or
the
zembabwans
could
lay
hand
on
it
easily
muttered
conan
disregarding
the
remark
concerning
himself
carve
his
liver
yet
gorulga
is
a
party
to
this
swindle
of
course
he
believes
in
his
gods
and
is
incorruptible
he
knows
nothing
about
this
he
will
obey
the
oracle
it
was
all
thutmekri
plan
knowing
the
keshani
would
consult
the
oracle
he
had
zargheba
bring
me
with
the
embassy
from
zembabwei
closely
veiled
and
secluded
i
damned
muttered
conan
priest
who
honestly
believes
in
his
oracle
and
can
not
be
bribed
crom
i
wonder
if
it
was
zargheba
who
banged
that
gong
did
he
know
i
was
here
could
he
have
known
about
that
rotten
flagging
where
is
he
now
girl
in
a
thicket
of
lotus
trees
near
the
ancient
avenue
that
leads
from
the
south
wall
of
the
cliffs
to
the
palace
she
answered
then
she
renewed
her
importunities
conan
have
pity
on
me
i
am
afraid
of
this
evil
ancient
place
i
know
i
have
heard
stealthy
footfalls
padding
about
me
oh
conan
take
me
away
with
you
zargheba
will
kill
me
when
i
have
served
his
purpose
here
i
know
it
the
priests
too
will
kill
me
if
they
discover
my
deceit
is
a
devil
he
bought
me
from
a
who
stole
me
out
of
a
caravan
bound
through
southern
koth
and
has
made
me
the
tool
of
his
intrigues
ever
since
take
me
away
from
him
you
can
not
be
as
cruel
as
he
do
leave
me
to
be
slain
here
please
please
she
was
on
her
knees
clutching
at
conan
hysterically
her
beautiful
face
upturned
to
him
her
dark
silken
hair
flowing
in
disorder
over
her
white
shoulders
conan
picked
her
up
and
set
her
on
his
knee
to
me
i
protect
you
from
zargheba
the
priests
shall
not
know
of
your
perfidy
but
you
got
to
do
as
i
tell
you
she
faltered
promises
of
explicit
obedience
clasping
his
corded
neck
as
if
seeking
security
from
the
contact
when
the
priests
come
you
act
the
part
of
yelaya
as
zargheba
planned
it
be
dark
and
in
the
torchlight
they
never
know
the
difference
but
you
say
this
to
them
it
is
the
will
of
the
gods
that
the
stygian
and
his
shemitish
dogs
be
driven
from
keshan
they
are
thieves
and
traitors
who
plot
to
rob
the
gods
let
the
teeth
of
gwahlur
be
placed
in
the
care
of
the
general
conan
let
him
lead
the
armies
of
keshan
he
is
beloved
of
the
gods
she
shivered
with
an
expression
of
desperation
but
acquiesced
zargheba
she
cried
kill
me
worry
about
zargheba
he
grunted
take
care
of
that
dog
you
do
as
i
say
here
put
up
your
hair
again
it
fallen
all
over
your
shoulders
and
the
gem
fallen
out
of
it
he
replaced
the
great
glowing
gem
himself
nodding
approval
worth
a
room
full
of
slaves
itself
alone
here
put
your
skirt
back
on
it
torn
down
the
side
but
the
priests
will
never
notice
it
wipe
your
face
a
goddess
does
cry
like
a
whipped
schoolgirl
by
crom
you
do
look
like
yelaya
face
hair
figure
and
all
if
you
act
the
goddess
with
the
priests
as
well
as
you
did
with
me
you
fool
them
easily
try
she
shivered
i
going
to
find
zargheba
at
that
she
became
panicky
again
do
leave
me
alone
this
place
is
haunted
nothing
here
to
harm
you
he
assured
her
impatiently
but
zargheba
and
i
going
to
look
after
him
i
be
back
shortly
i
be
watching
from
close
by
in
case
anything
goes
wrong
during
the
ceremony
but
if
you
play
your
part
properly
nothing
will
go
wrong
and
turning
he
hastened
out
of
the
oracle
chamber
behind
him
muriela
squeaked
wretchedly
at
his
going
twilight
had
fallen
the
great
rooms
and
halls
were
shadowy
and
indistinct
copper
friezes
glinted
dully
through
the
dusk
conan
strode
like
a
silent
phantom
through
the
great
halls
with
a
sensation
of
being
stared
at
from
the
shadowed
recesses
by
invisible
ghosts
of
the
past
no
wonder
the
girl
was
nervous
amid
such
surroundings
he
glided
down
the
marble
steps
like
a
slinking
panther
sword
in
hand
silence
reigned
over
the
valley
and
above
the
rim
of
the
cliffs
stars
were
blinking
out
if
the
priests
of
keshia
had
entered
the
valley
there
was
not
a
sound
not
a
movement
in
the
greenery
to
betray
them
he
made
out
the
ancient
avenue
wandering
away
to
the
south
lost
amid
clustering
masses
of
fronds
and
bushes
he
followed
it
warily
hugging
the
edge
of
the
paving
where
the
shrubs
massed
their
shadows
thickly
until
he
saw
ahead
of
him
dimly
in
the
dusk
the
clump
of
the
strange
growth
peculiar
to
the
black
lands
of
kush
there
according
to
the
girl
zargheba
should
be
lurking
conan
became
stealth
personified
a
shadow
he
melted
into
the
thickets
he
approached
the
lotus
grove
by
a
circuitous
movement
and
scarcely
the
rustle
of
a
leaf
proclaimed
his
passing
at
the
edge
of
the
trees
he
halted
suddenly
crouched
like
a
suspicious
panther
among
the
deep
shrubs
ahead
of
him
among
the
dense
leaves
showed
a
pallid
oval
dim
in
the
uncertain
light
it
might
have
been
one
of
the
great
white
blossoms
which
shone
thickly
among
the
branches
but
conan
knew
that
it
was
a
man
face
and
it
was
turned
toward
him
he
shrank
quickly
deeper
into
the
shadows
had
zargheba
seen
him
the
man
was
looking
directly
toward
him
seconds
passed
that
dim
face
had
not
moved
conan
could
make
out
the
dark
tuft
below
that
was
the
short
black
beard
and
suddenly
conan
was
aware
of
something
unnatural
zargheba
he
knew
was
not
a
tall
man
standing
erect
his
head
would
scarcely
top
the
cimmerian
shoulder
yet
that
face
was
on
a
level
with
conan
own
was
the
man
standing
on
something
conan
bent
and
peered
toward
the
ground
below
the
spot
where
the
face
showed
but
his
vision
was
blocked
by
undergrowth
and
the
thick
boles
of
the
trees
but
he
saw
something
else
and
he
stiffened
through
a
slot
in
the
underbrush
he
glimpsed
the
stem
of
the
tree
under
which
apparently
zargheba
was
standing
the
face
was
directly
in
line
with
that
tree
he
should
have
seen
below
that
face
not
the
but
zargheba
body
but
there
was
no
body
there
suddenly
tenser
than
a
tiger
who
stalks
his
prey
conan
glided
deeper
into
the
thicket
and
a
moment
later
drew
aside
a
leafy
branch
and
glared
at
the
face
that
had
not
moved
nor
would
it
ever
move
again
of
its
own
volition
he
looked
on
zargheba
severed
head
suspended
from
the
branch
of
the
tree
by
its
own
long
black
hair
the
return
of
the
oracle
conan
wheeled
supplely
sweeping
the
shadows
with
a
fiercely
questing
stare
there
was
no
sign
of
the
murdered
man
body
only
yonder
the
tall
lush
grass
was
trampled
and
broken
down
and
the
sward
was
dabbled
darkly
and
wetly
conan
stood
scarcely
breathing
as
he
strained
his
ears
into
the
silence
the
trees
and
bushes
with
their
great
pallid
blossoms
stood
dark
still
and
sinister
etched
against
the
deepening
dusk
primitive
fears
whispered
at
the
back
of
conan
mind
was
this
the
work
of
the
priests
of
keshan
if
so
where
were
they
was
it
zargheba
after
all
who
had
struck
the
gong
again
there
rose
the
memory
of
and
his
mysterious
servants
was
dead
shriveled
to
a
hulk
of
wrinkled
leather
and
bound
in
his
hollowed
crypt
to
greet
the
rising
sun
for
ever
but
the
servants
of
were
unaccounted
for
there
was
no
proof
they
had
ever
left
the
valley
conan
thought
of
the
girl
muriela
alone
and
unguarded
in
that
great
shadowy
palace
he
wheeled
and
ran
back
down
the
shadowed
avenue
and
he
ran
as
a
suspicious
panther
runs
poised
even
in
full
stride
to
whirl
right
or
left
and
strike
death
blows
the
palace
loomed
through
the
trees
and
he
saw
something
else
the
glow
of
fire
reflecting
redly
from
the
polished
marble
he
melted
into
the
bushes
that
lined
the
broken
street
glided
through
the
dense
growth
and
reached
the
edge
of
the
open
space
before
the
portico
voices
reached
him
torches
bobbed
and
their
flare
shone
on
glossy
ebon
shoulders
the
priests
of
keshan
had
come
they
had
not
advanced
up
the
wide
overgrown
avenue
as
zargheba
had
expected
them
to
do
obviously
there
was
more
than
one
secret
way
into
the
valley
of
alkmeenon
they
were
filing
up
the
broad
marble
steps
holding
their
torches
high
he
saw
gorulga
at
the
head
of
the
parade
a
profile
chiseled
out
of
copper
etched
in
the
torch
glare
the
rest
were
acolytes
giant
black
men
from
whose
skins
the
torches
struck
highlights
at
the
end
of
the
procession
there
stalked
a
huge
negro
with
an
unusually
wicked
cast
of
countenance
at
the
sight
of
whom
conan
scowled
that
was
gwarunga
whom
muriela
had
named
as
the
man
who
had
revealed
the
secret
of
the
to
zargheba
conan
wondered
how
deeply
the
man
was
in
the
intrigues
of
the
stygian
he
hurried
toward
the
portico
circling
the
open
space
to
keep
in
the
fringing
shadows
they
left
no
one
to
guard
the
entrance
the
torches
streamed
steadily
down
the
long
dark
hall
before
they
reached
the
door
at
the
other
end
conan
had
mounted
the
other
steps
and
was
in
the
hall
behind
them
slinking
swiftly
along
the
wall
he
reached
the
great
door
as
they
crossed
the
huge
their
torches
driving
back
the
shadows
they
did
not
look
back
in
single
file
their
ostrich
plumes
nodding
their
tunics
contrasting
curiously
with
the
marble
and
arabesqued
metal
of
the
ancient
palace
they
moved
across
the
wide
room
and
halted
momentarily
at
the
golden
door
to
the
left
of
the
gorulga
voice
boomed
eerily
and
hollowly
in
the
great
empty
space
framed
in
sonorous
phrases
unintelligible
to
the
lurking
listener
then
the
high
priest
thrust
open
the
golden
door
and
entered
bowing
repeatedly
from
his
waist
and
behind
him
the
torches
sank
and
rose
showering
flakes
of
flame
as
the
worshippers
imitated
their
master
the
gold
door
closed
behind
them
shutting
out
sound
and
sight
and
conan
darted
across
the
and
into
the
alcove
behind
the
throne
he
made
less
sound
than
a
wind
blowing
across
the
chamber
tiny
beams
of
light
streamed
through
the
apertures
in
the
wall
as
he
pried
open
the
secret
panel
gliding
into
the
niche
he
peered
through
muriela
sat
upright
on
the
dais
her
arms
folded
her
head
leaning
back
against
the
wall
within
a
few
inches
of
his
eyes
the
delicate
perfume
of
her
foamy
hair
was
in
his
nostrils
he
could
not
see
her
face
of
course
but
her
attitude
was
as
if
she
gazed
tranquilly
into
some
far
gulf
of
space
over
and
beyond
the
shaven
heads
of
the
black
giants
who
knelt
before
her
conan
grinned
with
appreciation
little
slut
an
actress
he
told
himself
he
knew
she
was
shriveling
with
terror
but
she
showed
no
sign
in
the
uncertain
flare
of
the
torches
she
looked
exactly
like
the
goddess
he
had
seen
lying
on
that
same
dais
if
one
could
imagine
that
goddess
imbued
with
vibrant
life
gorulga
was
booming
forth
some
kind
of
a
chant
in
an
accent
unfamiliar
to
conan
and
which
was
probably
some
invocation
in
the
ancient
tongue
of
alkmeenon
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
of
high
priests
it
seemed
interminable
conan
grew
restless
the
longer
the
thing
lasted
the
more
terrific
would
be
the
strain
on
muriela
if
she
snapped
he
hitched
his
sword
and
dagger
forward
he
could
not
see
the
little
trollop
tortured
and
slain
by
these
men
but
the
chant
deep
and
indescribably
ominous
came
to
a
conclusion
at
last
and
a
shouted
acclaim
from
the
acolytes
marked
its
period
lifting
his
head
and
raising
his
arms
toward
the
silent
form
on
the
dais
gorulga
cried
in
the
deep
rich
resonance
that
was
the
natural
attribute
of
the
keshani
priest
great
goddess
dweller
with
the
great
one
of
darkness
let
thy
heart
be
melted
thy
lips
opened
for
the
ears
of
thy
slave
whose
head
is
in
the
dust
beneath
thy
feet
speak
great
goddess
of
the
holy
valley
thou
knowest
the
paths
before
us
the
darkness
that
vexes
us
is
as
the
light
of
the
midday
sun
to
thee
shed
the
radiance
of
thy
wisdom
on
the
paths
of
thy
servants
tell
us
oh
mouthpiece
of
the
gods
what
is
their
will
concerning
thutmekri
the
stygian
the
burnished
mass
of
hair
that
caught
the
torchlight
in
dull
bronze
gleams
quivered
slightly
a
gusty
sigh
rose
from
the
blacks
half
in
awe
half
in
fear
muriela
voice
came
plainly
to
conan
ears
in
the
breathless
silence
and
it
seemed
cold
detached
impersonal
though
the
cimmerian
winced
at
the
corinthian
accent
is
the
will
of
the
gods
that
the
stygian
and
his
shemitish
dogs
be
driven
from
keshan
she
was
repeating
his
exact
words
are
thieves
and
traitors
who
plot
to
rob
the
gods
let
the
teeth
of
gwahlur
be
placed
in
the
care
of
the
general
conan
let
him
lead
the
armies
of
keshan
he
is
beloved
of
the
gods
there
was
a
quiver
in
her
voice
as
she
ended
and
conan
began
to
sweat
believing
she
was
on
the
point
of
an
hysterical
collapse
but
the
blacks
did
not
notice
any
more
than
they
identified
the
corinthian
accent
of
which
they
knew
nothing
they
smote
their
palms
softly
together
and
a
murmur
of
wonder
and
awe
rose
from
them
gorulga
eyes
glittered
fanatically
in
the
torchlight
has
spoken
he
cried
in
an
exalted
voice
is
the
will
of
the
gods
long
ago
in
the
days
of
our
ancestors
they
were
made
taboo
and
hidden
at
the
command
of
the
gods
who
wrenched
them
from
the
awful
jaws
of
gwahlur
the
king
of
darkness
in
the
birth
of
the
world
at
the
command
of
the
gods
the
teeth
of
gwahlur
were
hidden
at
their
command
they
shall
be
brought
forth
again
oh
goddess
give
us
your
leave
to
go
to
the
secret
of
the
teeth
to
secure
them
for
him
whom
the
gods
love
have
my
leave
to
go
answered
the
false
goddess
with
an
imperious
gesture
of
dismissal
that
set
conan
grinning
again
and
the
priests
backed
out
ostrich
plumes
and
torches
rising
and
falling
with
the
rhythm
of
their
genuflexions
the
gold
door
closed
and
with
a
moan
the
goddess
fell
back
limply
on
the
dais
she
whimpered
faintly
he
hissed
through
the
apertures
and
turning
glided
from
the
niche
and
closed
the
panel
a
glimpse
past
the
jamb
of
the
carven
door
showed
him
the
torches
receding
across
the
great
but
he
was
at
the
same
time
aware
of
a
radiance
that
did
not
emanate
from
the
torches
he
was
startled
but
the
solution
presented
itself
instantly
an
early
moon
had
risen
and
its
light
slanted
through
the
pierced
dome
which
by
some
curious
workmanship
intensified
the
light
the
shining
dome
of
alkmeenon
was
no
fable
then
perhaps
its
interior
was
of
the
curious
whitely
flaming
crystal
found
only
in
the
hills
of
the
black
countries
the
light
flooded
the
and
seeped
into
the
chambers
immediately
adjoining
but
as
conan
made
toward
the
door
that
led
into
the
he
was
brought
around
suddenly
by
a
noise
that
seemed
to
emanate
from
the
passage
that
led
off
from
the
alcove
he
crouched
at
the
mouth
staring
into
it
remembering
the
clangor
of
the
gong
that
had
echoed
from
it
to
lure
him
into
a
snare
the
light
from
the
dome
filtered
only
a
little
way
into
that
narrow
corridor
and
showed
him
only
empty
space
yet
he
could
have
sworn
that
he
had
heard
the
furtive
pad
of
a
foot
somewhere
down
it
while
he
hesitated
he
was
electrified
by
a
woman
strangled
cry
from
behind
him
bounding
through
the
door
behind
the
throne
he
saw
an
unexpected
spectacle
in
the
crystal
light
the
torches
of
the
priests
had
vanished
from
the
great
hall
outside
but
one
priest
was
still
in
the
palace
gwarunga
his
wicked
features
were
convulsed
with
fury
and
he
grasped
the
terrified
muriela
by
the
throat
choking
her
efforts
to
scream
and
plead
shaking
her
brutally
between
his
thick
red
lips
his
voice
hissed
like
a
cobra
game
are
you
playing
did
not
zargheba
tell
you
what
to
say
aye
thutmekri
told
me
are
you
betraying
your
master
or
is
he
betraying
his
friends
through
you
slut
i
twist
off
your
false
head
but
first
i
a
widening
of
his
captive
lovely
eyes
as
she
stared
over
his
shoulder
warned
the
huge
black
he
released
her
and
wheeled
just
as
sword
lashed
down
the
impact
of
the
stroke
knocked
him
headlong
backward
to
the
marble
floor
where
he
lay
twitching
blood
oozing
from
a
ragged
gash
in
his
scalp
conan
started
toward
him
to
finish
the
job
for
he
knew
that
the
priest
sudden
movement
had
caused
the
blade
to
strike
flat
but
muriela
threw
her
arms
convulsively
about
him
done
as
you
ordered
she
gasped
hysterically
me
away
oh
please
take
me
away
ca
go
yet
he
grunted
want
to
follow
the
priests
and
see
where
they
get
the
jewels
there
may
be
more
loot
hidden
there
but
you
can
go
with
me
where
the
gem
you
wore
in
your
hair
must
have
fallen
out
on
the
dais
she
stammered
feeling
for
it
was
so
frightened
when
the
priests
left
i
ran
out
to
find
you
and
this
big
brute
had
stayed
behind
and
he
grabbed
me
go
get
it
while
i
dispose
of
this
carcass
he
commanded
on
that
gem
is
worth
a
fortune
itself
she
hesitated
as
if
loth
to
return
to
that
cryptic
chamber
then
as
he
grasped
gwarunga
girdle
and
dragged
him
into
the
alcove
she
turned
and
entered
the
oracle
room
conan
dumped
the
senseless
black
on
the
floor
and
lifted
his
sword
the
cimmerian
had
lived
too
long
in
the
wild
places
of
the
world
to
have
any
illusions
about
mercy
the
only
safe
enemy
was
a
headless
enemy
but
before
he
could
strike
a
startling
scream
checked
the
lifted
blade
it
came
from
the
oracle
chamber
conan
she
come
back
the
shriek
ended
in
a
gurgle
and
a
scraping
shuffle
with
an
oath
conan
dashed
out
of
the
alcove
across
the
throne
dais
and
into
the
oracle
chamber
almost
before
the
sound
had
ceased
there
he
halted
glaring
bewilderedly
to
all
appearances
muriela
lay
placidly
on
the
dais
eyes
closed
as
in
slumber
in
thunder
are
you
doing
he
demanded
acidly
this
any
time
to
be
playing
jokes
his
voice
trailed
away
his
gaze
ran
along
the
ivory
thigh
molded
in
the
silk
skirt
that
skirt
should
gape
from
girdle
to
hem
he
knew
because
it
had
been
his
own
hand
that
tore
it
as
he
ruthlessly
stripped
the
garment
from
the
dancer
writhing
body
but
the
skirt
showed
no
rent
a
single
stride
brought
him
to
the
dais
and
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
ivory
body
snatched
it
away
as
if
it
had
encountered
hot
iron
instead
of
the
cold
immobility
of
death
he
muttered
his
eyes
suddenly
slits
of
not
muriela
it
yelaya
he
understood
now
that
frantic
scream
that
had
burst
from
muriela
lips
when
she
entered
the
chamber
the
goddess
had
returned
the
body
had
been
stripped
by
zargheba
to
furnish
the
accouterments
for
the
pretender
yet
now
it
was
clad
in
silk
and
jewels
as
conan
had
first
seen
it
a
peculiar
prickling
made
itself
manifest
among
the
short
hairs
at
the
base
of
conan
scalp
he
shouted
suddenly
where
the
devil
are
you
the
walls
threw
back
his
voice
mockingly
there
was
no
entrance
that
he
could
see
except
the
golden
door
and
none
could
have
entered
or
departed
through
that
without
his
knowledge
this
much
was
indisputable
yelaya
had
been
replaced
on
the
dais
within
the
few
minutes
that
had
elapsed
since
muriela
had
first
left
the
chamber
to
be
seized
by
gwarunga
his
ears
were
still
tingling
with
the
echoes
of
muriela
scream
yet
the
corinthian
girl
had
vanished
as
if
into
thin
air
there
was
but
one
explanation
that
offered
itself
to
the
cimmerian
if
he
rejected
the
darker
speculation
that
suggested
the
supernatural
somewhere
in
the
chamber
there
was
a
secret
door
and
even
as
the
thought
crossed
his
mind
he
saw
it
in
what
had
seemed
a
curtain
of
solid
marble
a
thin
perpendicular
crack
showed
and
in
the
crack
hung
a
wisp
of
silk
in
an
instant
he
was
bending
over
it
that
shred
was
from
muriela
torn
skirt
the
implication
was
unmistakable
it
had
been
caught
in
the
closing
door
and
torn
off
as
she
was
borne
through
the
opening
by
whatever
grim
beings
were
her
captors
the
bit
of
clothing
had
prevented
the
door
from
fitting
perfectly
into
its
frame
thrusting
his
into
the
crack
conan
exerted
leverage
with
a
corded
forearm
the
blade
bent
but
it
was
of
unbreakable
akbitanan
steel
the
marble
door
opened
conan
sword
was
lifted
as
he
peered
into
the
aperture
beyond
but
he
saw
no
shape
of
menace
light
filtering
into
the
oracle
chamber
revealed
a
short
flight
of
steps
cut
out
of
marble
pulling
the
door
back
to
its
fullest
extent
he
drove
his
dagger
into
a
crack
in
the
floor
propping
it
open
then
he
went
down
the
steps
without
hesitation
he
saw
nothing
heard
nothing
a
dozen
steps
down
the
stair
ended
in
a
narrow
corridor
which
ran
straight
away
into
gloom
he
halted
suddenly
posed
like
a
statue
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
staring
at
the
paintings
which
frescoed
the
walls
half
visible
in
the
dim
light
which
filtered
down
from
above
the
art
was
unmistakably
pelishtim
he
had
seen
frescoes
of
identical
characteristics
on
the
walls
of
asgalun
but
the
scenes
depicted
had
no
connection
with
anything
pelishtim
except
for
one
human
figure
frequently
recurrent
a
lean
old
man
whose
racial
characteristics
were
unmistakable
they
seemed
to
represent
various
sections
of
the
palace
above
several
scenes
showed
a
chamber
he
recognized
as
the
oracle
chamber
with
the
figure
of
yelaya
stretched
upon
the
ivory
dais
and
huge
black
men
kneeling
before
it
and
there
were
other
figures
too
figures
that
moved
through
the
deserted
palace
did
the
bidding
of
the
pelishtim
and
dragged
unnamable
things
out
of
the
subterranean
river
in
the
few
seconds
conan
stood
frozen
hitherto
unintelligible
phrases
in
the
parchment
manuscript
blazed
in
his
brain
with
chilling
clarity
the
loose
bits
of
the
pattern
clicked
into
place
the
mystery
of
was
a
mystery
no
longer
nor
the
riddle
of
servants
conan
turned
and
peered
into
the
darkness
an
icy
finger
crawling
along
his
spine
then
he
went
along
the
corridor
and
without
hesitation
moving
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
darkness
as
he
drew
farther
away
from
the
stair
the
air
hung
heavy
with
the
odor
he
had
scented
in
the
court
of
the
gong
now
in
utter
blackness
he
heard
a
sound
ahead
of
him
the
shuffle
of
bare
feet
or
the
swish
of
loose
garments
against
stone
he
could
not
tell
which
but
an
instant
later
his
outstretched
hand
encountered
a
barrier
which
he
identified
as
a
massive
door
of
carven
metal
he
pushed
against
it
fruitlessly
and
his
sought
vainly
for
a
crack
it
fitted
into
the
sill
and
jambs
as
if
molded
there
he
exerted
all
his
strength
his
feet
straining
against
the
door
the
veins
knotting
in
his
temples
it
was
useless
a
charge
of
elephants
would
scarcely
have
shaken
that
titanic
portal
as
he
leaned
there
he
caught
a
sound
on
the
other
side
that
his
ears
instantly
identified
it
was
the
creak
of
rusty
iron
like
a
lever
scraping
in
its
slot
instinctively
action
followed
recognition
so
spontaneously
that
sound
impulse
and
action
were
practically
simultaneous
and
as
his
prodigious
bound
carried
him
backward
there
was
the
rush
of
a
great
bulk
from
above
and
a
thunderous
crash
filled
the
tunnel
with
deafening
vibrations
bits
of
flying
splinters
struck
him
a
huge
block
of
stone
he
knew
from
the
sound
dropped
on
the
spot
he
had
just
quitted
an
instant
slower
thought
or
action
and
it
would
have
crushed
him
like
an
ant
conan
fell
back
somewhere
on
the
other
side
of
that
metal
door
muriela
was
a
captive
if
she
still
lived
but
he
could
not
pass
that
door
and
if
he
remained
in
the
tunnel
another
block
might
fall
and
he
might
not
be
so
lucky
it
would
do
the
girl
no
good
for
him
to
be
crushed
into
a
purple
pulp
he
could
not
continue
his
search
in
that
direction
he
must
get
above
ground
and
look
for
some
other
avenue
of
approach
he
turned
and
hurried
toward
the
stair
sighing
as
he
emerged
into
comparative
radiance
and
as
he
set
foot
on
the
first
step
the
light
was
blotted
out
and
above
him
the
marble
door
rushed
shut
with
a
resounding
reverberation
something
like
panic
seized
the
cimmerian
then
trapped
in
that
black
tunnel
and
he
wheeled
on
the
stair
lifting
his
sword
and
glaring
murderously
into
the
darkness
behind
him
expecting
a
rush
of
ghoulish
assailants
but
there
was
no
sound
or
movement
down
the
tunnel
did
the
men
beyond
the
door
if
they
were
men
believe
that
he
had
been
disposed
of
by
the
fall
of
the
stone
from
the
roof
which
had
undoubtedly
been
released
by
some
sort
of
machinery
then
why
had
the
door
been
shut
above
him
abandoning
speculation
conan
groped
his
way
up
the
steps
his
skin
crawling
in
anticipation
of
a
knife
in
his
back
at
every
stride
yearning
to
drown
his
in
a
barbarous
burst
of
he
thrust
against
the
door
at
the
top
and
cursed
soulfully
to
find
that
it
did
not
give
to
his
efforts
then
as
he
lifted
his
sword
with
his
right
hand
to
hew
at
the
marble
his
groping
left
encountered
a
metal
bolt
that
evidently
slipped
into
place
at
the
closing
of
the
door
in
an
instant
he
had
drawn
this
bolt
and
then
the
door
gave
to
his
shove
he
bounded
into
the
chamber
like
a
snarling
incarnation
of
fury
ferociously
desirous
to
come
to
grips
with
whatever
enemy
was
hounding
him
the
dagger
was
gone
from
the
floor
the
chamber
was
empty
and
so
was
the
dais
yelaya
had
again
vanished
crom
muttered
the
cimmerian
she
alive
after
all
he
strode
out
into
the
baffled
and
then
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
stepped
behind
the
throne
and
peered
into
the
alcove
there
was
blood
on
the
smooth
marble
where
he
had
cast
down
the
senseless
body
of
gwarunga
that
was
all
the
black
man
had
vanished
as
completely
as
yelaya
the
teeth
of
gwahlur
baffled
wrath
confused
the
brain
of
conan
the
cimmerian
he
knew
no
more
how
to
go
about
searching
for
muriela
than
he
had
known
how
to
go
about
searching
for
the
teeth
of
gwahlur
only
one
thought
occurred
to
him
to
follow
the
priests
perhaps
at
the
of
the
treasure
some
clue
would
be
revealed
to
him
it
was
a
slim
chance
but
better
than
wandering
about
aimlessly
as
he
hurried
through
the
great
shadowy
hall
that
led
to
the
portico
he
half
expected
the
lurking
shades
to
come
to
life
behind
him
with
rending
fangs
and
talons
but
only
the
beat
of
his
own
rapid
heart
accompanied
him
into
the
moonlight
that
dappled
the
shimmering
marble
at
the
foot
of
the
wide
steps
he
cast
about
in
the
bright
moonlight
for
some
sign
to
show
him
the
direction
he
must
go
and
he
found
it
petals
scattered
on
the
sward
told
where
an
arm
or
garment
had
brushed
against
a
branch
grass
had
been
pressed
down
under
heavy
feet
conan
who
had
tracked
wolves
in
his
native
hills
found
no
insurmountable
difficulty
in
following
the
trail
of
the
keshani
priests
it
led
away
from
the
palace
through
masses
of
shrubbery
where
great
pale
blossoms
spread
their
shimmering
petals
through
verdant
tangled
bushes
that
showered
blooms
at
the
touch
until
he
came
at
last
to
a
great
mass
of
rock
that
jutted
like
a
titan
castle
out
from
the
cliffs
at
a
point
closest
to
the
palace
which
however
was
almost
hidden
from
view
by
trees
evidently
that
babbling
priest
in
keshia
had
been
mistaken
when
he
said
the
teeth
were
hidden
in
the
palace
this
trail
had
led
him
away
from
the
place
where
muriela
had
disappeared
but
a
belief
was
growing
in
conan
that
each
part
of
the
valley
was
connected
with
that
palace
by
subterranean
passages
crouching
in
the
deep
shadows
of
the
bushes
he
scrutinized
the
great
jut
of
rock
which
stood
out
in
bold
relief
in
the
moonlight
it
was
covered
with
strange
grotesque
carvings
depicting
men
and
animals
and
creatures
that
might
have
been
gods
or
devils
the
style
of
art
differed
so
strikingly
from
that
of
the
rest
of
the
valley
that
conan
wondered
if
it
did
not
represent
a
different
era
and
race
and
was
itself
a
relic
of
an
age
lost
and
forgotten
at
whatever
immeasurably
distant
date
the
people
of
alkmeenon
had
found
and
entered
the
haunted
valley
a
great
door
stood
open
in
the
sheer
curtain
of
the
cliff
and
a
gigantic
dragon
head
was
carved
about
it
so
that
the
open
door
was
like
the
dragon
gaping
mouth
the
door
itself
was
of
carven
bronze
and
looked
to
weigh
several
tons
there
was
no
lock
that
he
could
see
but
a
series
of
bolts
showing
along
the
edge
of
the
massive
portal
as
it
stood
open
told
him
that
there
was
some
system
of
locking
and
unlocking
a
system
doubtless
known
only
to
the
priests
of
keshan
the
trail
showed
that
gorulga
and
his
henchmen
had
gone
through
that
door
but
conan
hesitated
to
wait
until
they
emerged
would
probably
mean
to
see
the
door
locked
in
his
face
and
he
might
not
be
able
to
solve
the
mystery
of
its
unlocking
on
the
other
hand
if
he
followed
them
in
they
might
emerge
and
lock
him
in
the
cavern
throwing
caution
to
the
winds
he
glided
silently
through
the
great
portal
somewhere
in
the
cavern
were
the
priests
the
teeth
of
gwahlur
and
perhaps
a
clue
to
the
fate
of
muriela
personal
risks
had
never
yet
deterred
the
cimmerian
from
any
purpose
moonlight
illumined
for
a
few
yards
the
wide
tunnel
in
which
he
found
himself
somewhere
ahead
of
him
he
saw
a
faint
glow
and
heard
the
echo
of
a
weird
chanting
the
priests
were
not
so
far
ahead
of
him
as
he
had
thought
the
tunnel
debouched
into
a
wide
room
before
the
moonlight
played
out
an
empty
cavern
of
no
great
dimensions
but
with
a
lofty
vaulted
roof
glowing
with
a
phosphorescent
encrustation
which
as
conan
knew
was
a
common
phenomenon
in
that
part
of
the
world
it
made
a
ghostly
in
which
he
was
able
to
see
a
bestial
image
squatting
on
a
shrine
and
the
black
mouths
of
six
or
seven
tunnels
leading
off
from
the
chamber
down
the
widest
of
these
the
one
directly
behind
the
squat
image
which
looked
toward
the
outer
opening
he
caught
the
gleam
of
torches
wavering
whereas
the
phosphorescent
glow
was
fixed
and
heard
the
chanting
increase
in
volume
down
it
he
went
recklessly
and
was
presently
peering
into
a
larger
cavern
than
the
one
he
had
just
left
there
was
no
phosphorus
here
but
the
light
of
the
torches
fell
on
a
larger
altar
and
a
more
obscene
and
repulsive
god
squatting
upon
it
before
this
repugnant
deity
gorulga
and
his
ten
acolytes
knelt
and
beat
their
heads
upon
the
ground
while
chanting
monotonously
conan
realized
why
their
progress
had
been
so
slow
evidently
approaching
the
secret
crypt
of
the
teeth
was
a
complicated
and
elaborate
ritual
he
was
fidgeting
in
nervous
impatience
before
the
chanting
and
bowing
were
over
but
presently
they
rose
and
passed
into
the
tunnel
which
opened
behind
the
idol
their
torches
bobbed
away
into
the
nighted
vault
and
he
followed
swiftly
not
much
danger
of
being
discovered
he
glided
along
the
shadows
like
a
creature
of
the
night
and
the
black
priests
were
completely
engrossed
in
their
ceremonial
mummery
apparently
they
had
not
even
noticed
the
absence
of
gwarunga
emerging
into
a
cavern
of
huge
proportions
about
whose
upward
curving
walls
ledges
marched
in
tiers
they
began
their
worship
anew
before
an
altar
which
was
larger
and
a
god
which
was
more
disgusting
than
any
encountered
thus
far
conan
crouched
in
the
black
mouth
of
the
tunnel
staring
at
the
walls
reflecting
the
lurid
glow
of
the
torches
he
saw
a
carven
stone
stair
winding
up
from
tier
to
tier
of
the
galleries
the
roof
was
lost
in
darkness
he
started
violently
and
the
chanting
broke
off
as
the
kneeling
blacks
flung
up
their
heads
an
inhuman
voice
boomed
out
high
above
them
they
froze
on
their
knees
their
faces
turned
upward
with
a
ghastly
blue
hue
in
the
sudden
glare
of
a
weird
light
that
burst
blindingly
up
near
the
lofty
roof
and
then
burned
with
a
throbbing
glow
that
glare
lighted
a
gallery
and
a
cry
went
up
from
the
high
priest
echoed
shudderingly
by
his
acolytes
in
the
flash
there
had
been
briefly
disclosed
to
them
a
slim
white
figure
standing
upright
in
a
sheen
of
silk
and
a
glint
of
gold
then
the
blaze
smoldered
to
a
throbbing
pulsing
luminosity
in
which
nothing
was
distinct
and
that
slim
shape
was
but
a
shimmering
blue
of
ivory
screamed
gorulga
his
brown
features
ashen
have
you
followed
us
what
is
your
pleasure
that
weird
unhuman
voice
rolled
down
from
the
roof
under
that
arching
vault
that
magnified
and
altered
it
beyond
recognition
to
the
unbelievers
woe
to
the
false
children
of
keshia
doom
to
them
which
deny
their
deity
a
cry
of
horror
went
up
from
the
priests
gorulga
looked
like
a
shocked
vulture
in
the
glare
of
the
torches
do
not
understand
he
stammered
are
faithful
in
the
chamber
of
the
oracle
you
told
us
not
heed
what
you
heard
in
the
chamber
of
the
oracle
rolled
that
terrible
voice
multiplied
until
it
was
as
though
a
myriad
voices
thundered
and
muttered
the
same
warning
of
false
prophets
and
false
gods
a
demon
in
my
guise
spoke
to
you
in
the
palace
giving
false
prophecy
now
harken
and
obey
for
only
i
am
the
true
goddess
and
i
give
you
one
chance
to
save
yourselves
from
doom
the
teeth
of
gwahlur
from
the
crypt
where
they
were
placed
so
long
ago
alkmeenon
is
no
longer
holy
because
it
has
been
desecrated
by
blasphemers
give
the
teeth
of
gwahlur
into
the
hands
of
thutmekri
the
stygian
to
place
in
the
sanctuary
of
dragon
and
derketo
only
this
can
save
keshan
from
the
doom
the
demons
of
the
night
have
plotted
take
the
teeth
of
gwahlur
and
go
return
instantly
to
keshia
there
give
the
jewels
to
thutmekri
and
seize
the
foreign
devil
conan
and
flay
him
alive
in
the
great
square
there
was
no
hesitation
in
obeying
chattering
with
fear
the
priests
scrambled
up
and
ran
for
the
door
that
opened
behind
the
bestial
god
gorulga
led
the
flight
they
jammed
briefly
in
the
doorway
yelping
as
wildly
waving
torches
touched
squirming
black
bodies
they
plunged
through
and
the
patter
of
their
speeding
feet
dwindled
down
the
tunnel
conan
did
not
follow
he
was
consumed
with
a
furious
desire
to
learn
the
truth
of
this
fantastic
affair
was
that
indeed
yelaya
as
the
cold
sweat
on
the
backs
of
his
hands
told
him
or
was
it
that
little
hussy
muriela
turned
traitress
after
all
if
it
was
before
the
last
torch
had
vanished
down
the
black
tunnel
he
was
bounding
vengefully
up
the
stone
stair
the
blue
glow
was
dying
down
but
he
could
still
make
out
that
the
ivory
figure
stood
motionless
on
the
gallery
his
blood
ran
cold
as
he
approached
it
but
he
did
not
hesitate
he
came
on
with
his
sword
lifted
and
towered
like
a
threat
of
death
over
the
inscrutable
shape
he
snarled
as
she
been
for
a
thousand
years
ha
from
the
dark
mouth
of
a
tunnel
behind
him
a
dark
form
lunged
but
the
sudden
deadly
rush
of
unshod
feet
had
reached
the
cimmerian
quick
ears
he
whirled
like
a
cat
and
dodged
the
blow
aimed
murderously
at
his
back
as
the
gleaming
steel
in
the
dark
hand
hissed
past
him
he
struck
back
with
the
fury
of
a
roused
python
and
the
long
straight
blade
impaled
his
assailant
and
stood
out
a
foot
and
a
half
between
his
shoulders
conan
tore
his
sword
free
as
the
victim
sagged
to
the
floor
gasping
and
gurgling
the
man
writhed
briefly
and
stiffened
in
the
dying
light
conan
saw
a
black
body
and
ebon
countenance
hideous
in
the
blue
glare
he
had
killed
gwarunga
conan
turned
from
the
corpse
to
the
goddess
thongs
about
her
knees
and
breast
held
her
upright
against
a
stone
pillar
and
her
thick
hair
fastened
to
the
column
held
her
head
up
at
a
few
yards
distance
these
bonds
were
not
visible
in
the
uncertain
light
must
have
come
to
after
i
descended
into
the
tunnel
muttered
conan
must
have
suspected
i
was
down
there
so
he
pulled
out
the
dagger
conan
stooped
and
wrenched
the
identical
weapon
from
the
stiffening
fingers
glanced
at
it
and
replaced
it
in
his
own
girdle
shut
the
door
then
he
took
yelaya
to
befool
his
brother
idiots
that
was
he
shouting
a
while
ago
you
could
recognize
his
voice
under
this
echoing
roof
and
that
bursting
blue
flame
i
thought
it
looked
familiar
it
a
trick
of
the
stygian
priests
thutmekri
must
have
given
some
of
it
to
gwarunga
he
could
easily
have
reached
this
cavern
ahead
of
his
companions
evidently
familiar
with
the
plan
of
the
caverns
by
hearsay
or
by
maps
handed
down
in
the
priestcraft
he
had
entered
the
cave
after
the
others
carrying
the
goddess
followed
a
circuitous
route
through
the
tunnels
and
chambers
and
ensconced
himself
and
his
burden
on
the
balcony
while
gorulga
and
the
other
acolytes
were
engaged
in
their
endless
rituals
the
blue
glare
had
faded
but
now
conan
was
aware
of
another
glow
emanating
from
the
mouth
of
one
of
the
corridors
that
opened
on
the
ledge
somewhere
down
that
corridor
there
was
another
field
of
phosphorus
for
he
recognized
the
faint
steady
radiance
the
corridor
led
in
the
direction
the
priests
had
taken
and
he
decided
to
follow
it
rather
than
descend
into
the
darkness
of
the
great
cavern
below
doubtless
it
connected
with
another
gallery
in
some
other
chamber
which
might
be
the
destination
of
the
priests
he
hurried
down
it
the
illumination
growing
stronger
as
he
advanced
until
he
could
make
out
the
floor
and
the
walls
of
the
tunnel
ahead
of
him
and
below
he
could
hear
the
priests
chanting
again
abruptly
a
doorway
in
the
wall
was
limned
in
the
phosphorus
glow
and
to
his
ears
came
the
sound
of
soft
hysterical
sobbing
he
wheeled
and
glared
through
the
door
he
was
looking
again
into
a
chamber
hewn
out
of
solid
rock
not
a
natural
cavern
like
the
others
the
domed
roof
shone
with
the
phosphorous
light
and
the
walls
were
almost
covered
with
arabesques
of
beaten
gold
near
the
farther
wall
on
a
granite
throne
staring
for
ever
toward
the
arched
doorway
sat
the
monstrous
and
obscene
pteor
the
god
of
the
pelishtim
wrought
in
brass
with
his
exaggerated
attributes
reflecting
the
grossness
of
his
cult
and
in
his
lap
sprawled
a
limp
white
figure
i
be
damned
muttered
conan
he
glanced
suspiciously
about
the
chamber
seeing
no
other
entrance
or
evidence
of
occupation
and
then
advanced
noiselessly
and
looked
down
at
the
girl
whose
slim
shoulders
shook
with
sobs
of
abject
misery
her
face
sunk
in
her
arms
from
thick
bands
of
gold
on
the
idol
arms
slim
gold
chains
ran
to
smaller
bands
on
her
wrists
he
laid
a
hand
on
her
naked
shoulder
and
she
started
convulsively
shrieked
and
twisted
her
face
toward
him
she
made
a
spasmodic
effort
to
go
into
the
usual
clinch
but
the
chains
hindered
her
he
cut
through
the
soft
gold
as
close
to
her
wrists
as
he
could
grunting
have
to
wear
these
bracelets
until
i
can
find
a
chisel
or
a
file
let
go
of
me
damn
it
you
actresses
are
too
damned
emotional
what
happened
to
you
anyway
i
went
back
into
the
oracle
chamber
she
whimpered
saw
the
goddess
lying
on
the
dais
as
i
first
seen
her
i
called
out
to
you
and
started
to
run
to
the
door
then
something
grabbed
me
from
behind
it
clapped
a
hand
over
my
mouth
and
carried
me
through
a
panel
in
the
wall
and
down
some
steps
and
along
a
dark
hall
i
did
see
what
it
was
that
had
hold
of
me
until
we
passed
through
a
big
metal
door
and
came
into
a
tunnel
whose
roof
was
alight
like
this
chamber
i
nearly
fainted
when
i
saw
they
are
not
humans
they
are
gray
hairy
devils
that
walk
like
men
and
speak
a
gibberish
no
human
could
understand
they
stood
there
and
seemed
to
be
waiting
and
once
i
thought
i
heard
somebody
trying
the
door
then
one
of
the
things
pulled
a
metal
lever
in
the
wall
and
something
crashed
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
they
carried
me
on
and
on
through
winding
tunnels
and
up
stone
stairways
into
this
chamber
where
they
chained
me
on
the
knees
of
this
abominable
idol
and
then
they
went
away
oh
conan
what
are
they
of
he
grunted
found
a
manuscript
that
told
me
a
number
of
things
and
then
stumbled
upon
some
frescoes
that
told
me
the
rest
was
a
pelishtim
who
wandered
into
the
valley
with
his
servants
after
the
people
of
alkmeenon
had
deserted
it
he
found
the
body
of
princess
yelaya
and
discovered
that
the
priests
returned
from
time
to
time
to
make
offerings
to
her
for
even
then
she
was
worshipped
as
a
goddess
made
an
oracle
of
her
and
he
was
the
voice
of
the
oracle
speaking
from
a
niche
he
cut
in
the
wall
behind
the
ivory
dais
the
priests
never
suspected
never
saw
him
or
his
servants
for
they
always
hid
themselves
when
the
men
came
lived
and
died
here
without
ever
being
discovered
by
the
priests
crom
knows
how
long
he
dwelt
here
but
it
must
have
been
for
centuries
the
wise
men
of
the
pelishtim
know
how
to
increase
the
span
of
their
lives
for
hundreds
of
years
i
seen
some
of
them
myself
why
he
lived
here
alone
and
why
he
played
the
part
of
oracle
no
ordinary
human
can
guess
but
i
believe
the
oracle
part
was
to
keep
the
city
inviolate
and
sacred
so
he
could
remain
undisturbed
he
ate
the
food
the
priests
brought
as
an
offering
to
yelaya
and
his
servants
ate
other
things
i
always
known
there
was
a
subterranean
river
flowing
away
from
the
lake
where
the
people
of
the
puntish
highlands
throw
their
dead
that
river
runs
under
this
palace
they
have
ladders
hung
over
the
water
where
they
can
hang
and
fish
for
the
corpses
that
come
floating
through
recorded
everything
on
parchment
and
painted
walls
he
died
at
last
and
his
servants
mummified
him
according
to
instructions
he
gave
them
before
his
death
and
stuck
him
in
a
cave
in
the
cliffs
the
rest
is
easy
to
guess
his
servants
who
were
even
more
nearly
immortal
than
he
kept
on
dwelling
here
but
the
next
time
a
high
priest
came
to
consult
the
oracle
not
having
a
master
to
restrain
them
they
tore
him
to
pieces
so
since
then
until
gorulga
nobody
came
to
talk
to
the
oracle
obvious
they
been
renewing
the
garments
and
ornaments
of
the
goddess
as
they
seen
do
doubtless
there
a
sealed
chamber
somewhere
where
the
silks
are
kept
from
decay
they
clothed
the
goddess
and
brought
her
back
to
the
oracle
room
after
zargheba
had
stolen
her
and
by
the
way
they
took
off
zargheba
head
and
hung
it
in
a
thicket
she
shivered
yet
at
the
same
time
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
never
whip
me
again
this
side
of
hell
agreed
conan
come
on
gwarunga
ruined
my
chances
with
his
stolen
goddess
i
going
to
follow
the
priests
and
take
my
chance
of
stealing
the
loot
from
them
after
they
get
it
and
you
stay
close
to
me
i
ca
spend
all
my
time
looking
for
you
the
servants
of
she
whispered
fearfully
have
to
take
our
chance
he
grunted
do
know
what
in
their
minds
but
so
far
they
have
shown
any
disposition
to
come
out
and
fight
in
the
open
come
on
taking
her
wrist
he
led
her
out
of
the
chamber
and
down
the
corridor
as
they
advanced
they
heard
the
chanting
of
the
priests
and
mingling
with
the
sound
the
low
sullen
rushing
of
waters
the
light
grew
stronger
above
them
as
they
emerged
on
a
gallery
of
a
great
cavern
and
looked
down
on
a
scene
weird
and
fantastic
above
them
gleamed
the
phosphorescent
roof
a
hundred
feet
below
them
stretched
the
smooth
floor
of
the
cavern
on
the
far
side
this
floor
was
cut
by
a
deep
narrow
stream
brimming
its
rocky
channel
rushing
out
of
impenetrable
gloom
it
swirled
across
the
cavern
and
was
lost
again
in
darkness
the
visible
surface
reflected
the
radiance
above
the
dark
seething
waters
glinted
as
if
flecked
with
living
jewels
frosty
blue
lurid
red
shimmering
green
an
iridescence
conan
and
his
companion
stood
upon
one
of
the
ledges
that
banded
the
curve
of
the
lofty
wall
and
from
this
ledge
a
natural
bridge
of
stone
soared
in
a
arch
over
the
vast
gulf
of
the
cavern
to
join
a
much
smaller
ledge
on
the
opposite
side
across
the
river
ten
feet
below
it
another
broader
arch
spanned
the
cave
at
either
end
a
carven
stair
joined
the
extremities
of
these
flying
arches
conan
gaze
following
the
curve
of
the
arch
that
swept
away
from
the
ledge
on
which
they
stood
caught
a
glint
of
light
that
was
not
the
lurid
phosphorus
of
the
cavern
on
that
small
ledge
opposite
them
there
was
an
opening
in
the
cave
wall
through
which
stars
were
glinting
but
his
full
attention
was
drawn
to
the
scene
beneath
them
the
priests
had
reached
their
destination
there
in
a
sweeping
angle
of
the
cavern
wall
stood
a
stone
altar
but
there
was
no
idol
upon
it
whether
there
was
one
behind
it
conan
could
not
ascertain
because
some
trick
of
the
light
or
the
sweep
of
the
wall
left
the
space
behind
the
altar
in
total
darkness
the
priests
had
stuck
their
torches
into
holes
in
the
stone
floor
forming
a
semicircle
of
fire
in
front
of
the
altar
at
a
distance
of
several
yards
then
the
priests
themselves
formed
a
semicircle
inside
the
crescent
of
torches
and
gorulga
after
lifting
his
arms
aloft
in
invocation
bent
to
the
altar
and
laid
hands
on
it
it
lifted
and
tilted
backward
on
its
hinder
edge
like
the
lid
of
a
chest
revealing
a
small
crypt
extending
a
long
arm
into
the
recess
gorulga
brought
up
a
small
brass
chest
lowering
the
altar
back
into
place
he
set
the
chest
on
it
and
threw
back
the
lid
to
the
eager
watchers
on
the
high
gallery
it
seemed
as
if
the
action
had
released
a
blaze
of
living
fire
which
throbbed
and
quivered
about
the
opened
chest
conan
heart
leaped
and
his
hand
caught
at
his
hilt
the
teeth
of
gwahlur
at
last
the
treasure
that
would
make
its
possessor
the
richest
man
in
the
world
his
breath
came
fast
between
his
clenched
teeth
then
he
was
suddenly
aware
that
a
new
element
had
entered
into
the
light
of
the
torches
and
of
the
phosphorescent
roof
rendering
both
void
darkness
stole
around
the
altar
except
for
that
glowing
spot
of
evil
radiance
cast
by
the
teeth
of
gwahlur
and
that
grew
and
grew
the
blacks
froze
into
basaltic
statues
their
shadows
streaming
grotesquely
and
gigantically
out
behind
them
the
altar
was
laved
in
the
glow
now
and
the
astounded
features
of
gorulga
stood
out
in
sharp
relief
then
the
mysterious
space
behind
the
altar
swam
into
the
widening
illumination
and
slowly
with
the
crawling
light
figures
became
visible
like
shapes
growing
out
of
the
night
and
silence
at
first
they
seemed
like
gray
stone
statues
those
motionless
shapes
hairy
yet
hideously
human
but
their
eyes
were
alive
cold
sparks
of
gray
icy
fire
and
as
the
weird
glow
lit
their
bestial
countenances
gorulga
screamed
and
fell
backward
throwing
up
his
long
arms
in
a
gesture
of
frenzied
horror
but
a
longer
arm
shot
across
the
altar
and
a
misshapen
hand
locked
on
his
throat
screaming
and
fighting
the
high
priest
was
dragged
back
across
the
altar
a
fist
smashed
down
and
gorulga
cries
were
stilled
limp
and
broken
he
sagged
across
the
altar
his
brains
oozing
from
his
crushed
skull
and
then
the
servants
of
surged
like
a
bursting
flood
from
hell
on
the
black
priests
who
stood
like
images
then
there
was
slaughter
grim
and
appalling
conan
saw
black
bodies
tossed
like
chaff
in
the
inhuman
hands
of
the
slayers
against
whose
horrible
strength
and
agility
the
daggers
and
swords
of
the
priests
were
ineffective
he
saw
men
lifted
bodily
and
their
heads
cracked
open
against
the
stone
altar
he
saw
a
flaming
torch
grasped
in
a
monstrous
hand
thrust
inexorably
down
the
gullet
of
an
agonized
wretch
who
writhed
in
vain
against
the
arms
that
pinioned
him
he
saw
a
man
torn
in
two
pieces
as
one
might
tear
a
chicken
and
the
bloody
fragments
hurled
clear
across
the
cavern
the
massacre
was
as
short
and
devastating
as
the
rush
of
a
hurricane
in
a
burst
of
red
abysmal
ferocity
it
was
over
except
for
one
wretch
who
fled
screaming
back
the
way
the
priests
had
come
pursued
by
a
swarm
of
shapes
of
horror
which
reached
out
their
hands
for
him
fugitive
and
pursuers
vanished
down
the
black
tunnel
and
the
screams
of
the
human
came
back
dwindling
and
confused
by
the
distance
muriela
was
on
her
knees
clutching
conan
legs
her
face
pressed
against
his
knee
and
her
eyes
tightly
shut
she
was
a
quaking
quivering
mold
of
abject
terror
but
conan
was
galvanized
a
quick
glance
across
at
the
aperture
where
the
stars
shone
a
glance
down
at
the
chest
that
still
blazed
open
on
the
altar
and
he
saw
and
seized
the
desperate
gamble
going
after
that
chest
he
grated
here
mitra
no
in
an
agony
of
fright
she
fell
to
the
floor
and
caught
at
his
sandals
do
do
leave
me
still
and
keep
your
mouth
shut
he
snapped
disengaging
himself
from
her
frantic
clasp
he
disregarded
the
tortuous
stair
he
dropped
from
ledge
to
ledge
with
reckless
haste
there
was
no
sign
of
the
monsters
as
his
feet
hit
the
floor
a
few
of
the
torches
still
flared
in
their
sockets
the
phosphorescent
glow
throbbed
and
quivered
and
the
river
flowed
with
an
almost
articulate
muttering
scintillant
with
undreamed
radiances
the
glow
that
had
heralded
the
appearance
of
the
servants
had
vanished
with
them
only
the
light
of
the
jewels
in
the
brass
chest
shimmered
and
quivered
he
snatched
the
chest
noting
its
contents
in
one
lustful
glance
strange
curiously
shapen
stones
that
burned
with
an
icy
fire
he
slammed
the
lid
thrust
the
chest
under
his
arm
and
ran
back
up
the
steps
he
had
no
desire
to
encounter
the
hellish
servants
of
his
glimpse
of
them
in
action
had
dispelled
any
illusion
concerning
their
fighting
ability
why
they
had
waited
so
long
before
striking
at
the
invaders
he
was
unable
to
say
what
human
could
guess
the
motives
or
thoughts
of
these
monstrosities
that
they
were
possessed
of
craft
and
intelligence
equal
to
humanity
had
been
demonstrated
and
there
on
the
cavern
floor
lay
crimson
proof
of
their
bestial
ferocity
the
corinthian
girl
still
cowered
on
the
gallery
where
he
had
left
her
he
caught
her
wrist
and
yanked
her
to
her
feet
grunting
guess
time
to
go
too
bemused
with
terror
to
be
fully
aware
of
what
was
going
on
the
girl
suffered
herself
to
be
led
across
the
dizzy
span
it
was
not
until
they
were
poised
over
the
rushing
water
that
she
looked
down
voiced
a
startled
yelp
and
would
have
fallen
but
for
conan
massive
arm
about
her
growling
an
objurgation
in
her
ear
he
snatched
her
up
under
his
free
arm
and
swept
her
in
a
flutter
of
limply
waving
arms
and
legs
across
the
arch
and
into
the
aperture
that
opened
at
the
other
end
without
bothering
to
set
her
on
her
feet
he
hurried
through
the
short
tunnel
into
which
this
aperture
opened
an
instant
later
they
emerged
upon
a
narrow
ledge
on
the
outer
side
of
the
cliffs
that
circled
the
valley
less
than
a
hundred
feet
below
them
the
jungle
waved
in
the
starlight
looking
down
conan
vented
a
gusty
sigh
of
relief
he
believed
that
he
could
negotiate
the
descent
even
though
burdened
with
the
jewels
and
the
girl
although
he
doubted
if
even
he
unburdened
could
have
ascended
at
that
spot
he
set
the
chest
still
smeared
with
blood
and
clotted
with
his
brains
on
the
ledge
and
was
about
to
remove
his
girdle
in
order
to
tie
the
box
to
his
back
when
he
was
galvanized
by
a
sound
behind
him
a
sound
sinister
and
unmistakable
here
he
snapped
at
the
bewildered
corinthian
girl
move
and
drawing
his
sword
he
glided
into
the
tunnel
glaring
back
into
the
cavern
halfway
across
the
upper
span
he
saw
a
gray
deformed
shape
one
of
the
servants
of
was
on
his
trail
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
brute
had
seen
them
and
was
following
them
conan
did
not
hesitate
it
might
be
easier
to
defend
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
but
this
fight
must
be
finished
quickly
before
the
other
servants
could
return
he
ran
out
on
the
span
straight
toward
the
oncoming
monster
it
was
no
ape
neither
was
it
a
man
it
was
some
shambling
horror
spawned
in
the
mysterious
nameless
jungles
of
the
south
where
strange
life
teemed
in
the
reeking
rot
without
the
dominance
of
man
and
drums
thundered
in
temples
that
had
never
known
the
tread
of
a
human
foot
how
the
ancient
pelishtim
had
gained
lordship
over
them
and
with
it
eternal
exile
from
humanity
was
a
foul
riddle
about
which
conan
did
not
care
to
speculate
even
if
he
had
had
opportunity
man
and
monster
they
met
at
the
highest
arch
of
the
span
where
a
hundred
feet
below
rushed
the
furious
black
water
as
the
monstrous
shape
with
its
leprous
gray
body
and
the
features
of
a
carven
unhuman
idol
loomed
over
him
conan
struck
as
a
wounded
tiger
strikes
with
every
ounce
of
thew
and
fury
behind
the
blow
that
stroke
would
have
sheared
a
human
body
asunder
but
the
bones
of
the
servant
of
were
like
tempered
steel
yet
even
tempered
steel
could
not
wholly
have
withstood
that
furious
stroke
ribs
and
parted
and
blood
spouted
from
the
great
gash
there
was
no
time
for
a
second
stroke
before
the
cimmerian
could
lift
his
blade
again
or
spring
clear
the
sweep
of
a
giant
arm
knocked
him
from
the
span
as
a
fly
is
flicked
from
a
wall
as
he
plunged
downward
the
rush
of
the
river
was
like
a
knell
in
his
ears
but
his
twisted
body
fell
halfway
across
the
lower
arch
he
wavered
there
precariously
for
one
instant
then
his
clutching
fingers
hooked
over
the
farther
edge
and
he
scrambled
to
safety
his
sword
still
in
his
other
hand
as
he
sprang
up
he
saw
the
monster
spurting
blood
hideously
rush
toward
the
of
the
bridge
obviously
intending
to
descend
the
stair
that
connected
the
arches
and
renew
the
feud
at
the
very
ledge
the
brute
paused
in
and
conan
saw
it
too
muriela
with
the
jewel
chest
under
her
arm
stood
staring
wildly
in
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
with
a
triumphant
bellow
the
monster
scooped
her
up
under
one
arm
snatched
the
jewel
chest
with
the
other
hand
as
she
dropped
it
and
turning
lumbered
back
across
the
bridge
conan
cursed
with
passion
and
ran
for
the
other
side
also
he
doubted
if
he
could
climb
the
stair
to
the
higher
arch
in
time
to
catch
the
brute
before
it
could
plunge
into
the
labyrinth
of
tunnels
on
the
other
side
but
the
monster
was
slowing
like
clockwork
running
down
blood
gushed
from
that
terrible
gash
in
his
breast
and
he
lurched
drunkenly
from
side
to
side
suddenly
he
stumbled
reeled
and
toppled
sidewise
pitched
headlong
from
the
arch
and
hurtled
downward
girl
and
jewel
chest
fell
from
his
nerveless
hands
and
muriela
scream
rang
terribly
above
the
snarl
of
the
water
below
conan
was
almost
under
the
spot
from
which
the
creature
had
fallen
the
monster
struck
the
lower
arch
glancingly
and
shot
off
but
the
writhing
figure
of
the
girl
struck
and
clung
and
the
chest
hit
the
edge
of
the
span
near
her
one
falling
object
struck
on
one
side
of
conan
and
one
on
the
other
either
was
within
arm
length
for
the
fraction
of
a
split
second
the
chest
teetered
on
the
edge
of
the
bridge
and
muriela
clung
by
one
arm
her
face
turned
desperately
toward
conan
her
eyes
dilated
with
the
fear
of
death
and
her
lips
parted
in
a
haunting
cry
of
despair
conan
did
not
hesitate
nor
did
he
even
glance
toward
the
chest
that
held
the
wealth
of
an
epoch
with
a
quickness
that
would
have
shamed
the
spring
of
a
hungry
jaguar
he
swooped
grasped
the
girl
arm
just
as
her
fingers
slipped
from
the
smooth
stone
and
snatched
her
up
on
the
span
with
one
explosive
heave
the
chest
toppled
on
over
and
struck
the
water
ninety
feet
below
where
the
body
of
the
servant
of
had
already
vanished
a
splash
a
jetting
flash
of
foam
marked
where
the
teeth
of
gwahlur
disappeared
for
ever
from
the
sight
of
the
man
conan
scarcely
wasted
a
downward
glance
he
darted
across
the
span
and
ran
up
the
cliff
stair
like
a
cat
carrying
the
limp
girl
as
if
she
had
been
an
infant
a
hideous
ululation
caused
him
to
glance
over
his
shoulder
as
he
reached
the
higher
arch
to
see
the
other
servants
streaming
back
into
the
cavern
below
blood
dripping
from
their
bared
fangs
they
raced
up
the
stair
that
wound
from
tier
to
tier
roaring
vengefully
but
he
slung
the
girl
unceremoniously
over
his
shoulder
dashed
through
the
tunnel
and
went
down
the
cliffs
like
an
ape
himself
dropping
and
springing
from
hold
to
hold
with
breakneck
recklessness
when
the
fierce
countenances
looked
over
the
ledge
of
the
aperture
it
was
to
see
the
cimmerian
and
the
girl
disappearing
into
the
forest
that
surrounded
the
cliffs
said
conan
setting
the
girl
on
her
feet
within
the
sheltering
screen
of
branches
can
take
our
time
now
i
do
think
those
brutes
will
follow
us
outside
the
valley
anyway
i
got
a
horse
tied
at
a
close
by
if
the
lions
have
eaten
him
crom
devils
what
are
you
crying
about
now
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
her
slim
shoulders
shook
with
sobs
lost
the
jewels
for
you
she
wailed
miserably
was
my
fault
if
i
obeyed
you
and
stayed
out
on
the
ledge
that
brute
would
never
have
seen
me
you
should
have
caught
the
gems
and
let
me
drown
i
suppose
i
should
he
agreed
forget
it
never
worry
about
what
past
and
stop
crying
will
you
that
better
come
on
mean
you
going
to
keep
me
take
me
with
you
she
asked
hopefully
else
do
you
suppose
i
do
with
you
he
ran
an
approving
glance
over
her
figure
and
grinned
at
the
torn
skirt
which
revealed
a
generous
expanse
of
tempting
curves
can
use
an
actress
like
you
there
no
use
going
back
to
keshia
there
nothing
in
keshan
now
that
i
want
we
go
to
punt
the
people
of
punt
worship
an
ivory
woman
and
they
wash
gold
out
of
the
rivers
in
wicker
baskets
i
tell
them
that
keshan
is
intriguing
with
thutmekri
to
enslave
them
which
is
true
and
that
the
gods
have
sent
me
to
protect
them
for
about
a
houseful
of
gold
if
i
can
manage
to
smuggle
you
into
their
temple
to
exchange
places
with
their
ivory
goddess
we
skin
them
out
of
their
jaw
teeth
before
we
get
through
with
them
