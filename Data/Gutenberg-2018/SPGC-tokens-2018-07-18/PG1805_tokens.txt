a
trust
is
its
weakest
point
said
jeff
peters
that
said
i
sounds
like
one
of
those
unintelligible
remarks
such
as
is
a
policeman
it
is
not
said
jeff
there
are
no
relations
between
a
trust
and
a
policeman
my
remark
was
an
epitogram
an
axis
a
kind
of
in
parvo
what
it
means
is
that
a
trust
is
like
an
egg
and
it
is
not
like
an
egg
if
you
want
to
break
an
egg
you
have
to
do
it
from
the
outside
the
only
way
to
break
up
a
trust
is
from
the
inside
keep
sitting
on
it
until
it
hatches
look
at
the
brood
of
young
colleges
and
libraries
that
chirping
and
peeping
all
over
the
country
yes
sir
every
trust
bears
in
its
own
bosom
the
seeds
of
its
destruction
like
a
rooster
that
crows
near
a
georgia
colored
methodist
camp
meeting
or
a
republican
announcing
himself
a
candidate
for
governor
of
texas
i
asked
jeff
jestingly
if
he
had
ever
during
his
checkered
plaided
mottled
pied
and
dappled
career
conducted
an
enterprise
of
the
class
to
which
the
word
trust
had
been
applied
somewhat
to
my
surprise
he
acknowledged
the
corner
once
said
he
and
the
state
seal
of
new
jersey
never
bit
into
a
charter
that
opened
up
a
solider
and
safer
piece
of
legitimate
octopusing
we
had
everything
in
our
favor
wind
water
police
nerve
and
a
clean
monopoly
of
an
article
indispensable
to
the
public
there
was
a
trust
buster
on
the
globe
that
could
have
found
a
weak
spot
in
our
scheme
it
made
rockefeller
little
kerosene
speculation
look
like
a
bucket
shop
but
we
lost
out
some
unforeseen
opposition
came
up
i
suppose
i
said
no
sir
it
was
just
as
i
said
we
were
it
was
a
case
of
there
was
a
rift
within
the
loot
as
albert
tennyson
says
you
remember
i
told
you
that
me
and
andy
tucker
was
partners
for
some
years
that
man
was
the
most
talented
conniver
at
stratagems
i
ever
saw
whenever
he
saw
a
dollar
in
another
man
hands
he
took
it
as
a
personal
grudge
if
he
could
take
it
any
other
way
andy
was
educated
too
besides
having
a
lot
of
useful
information
he
had
acquired
a
big
amount
of
experience
out
of
books
and
could
talk
for
hours
on
any
subject
connected
with
ideas
and
discourse
he
had
been
in
every
line
of
graft
from
lecturing
on
palestine
with
a
lot
of
magic
lantern
pictures
of
the
annual
clothiers
association
convention
at
atlantic
city
to
flooding
connecticut
with
bogus
wood
alcohol
distilled
from
nutmegs
one
spring
me
and
andy
had
been
over
in
mexico
on
a
flying
trip
during
which
a
philadelphia
capitalist
had
paid
us
for
a
half
interest
in
a
silver
mine
in
chihuahua
oh
yes
the
mine
was
all
right
the
other
half
interest
must
have
been
worth
two
or
three
thousand
i
often
wondered
who
owned
that
mine
in
coming
back
to
the
united
states
me
and
andy
stubbed
our
toes
against
a
little
town
in
texas
on
the
bank
of
the
rio
grande
the
name
of
it
was
bird
city
but
it
was
the
town
had
about
inhabitants
mostly
men
i
figured
out
that
their
principal
means
of
existence
was
in
living
close
to
tall
chaparral
some
of
were
stockmen
and
some
gamblers
and
some
horse
peculators
and
plenty
were
in
the
smuggling
line
me
and
andy
put
up
at
a
hotel
that
was
built
like
something
between
a
and
a
sectional
bookcase
it
began
to
rain
the
day
we
got
there
as
the
saying
is
juniper
aquarius
was
sure
turning
on
the
water
plugs
on
mount
amphibious
now
there
were
three
saloons
in
bird
city
though
neither
andy
nor
me
drank
but
we
could
see
the
townspeople
making
a
triangular
procession
from
one
to
another
all
day
and
half
the
night
everybody
seemed
to
know
what
to
do
with
as
much
money
as
they
had
the
third
day
of
the
rain
it
slacked
up
awhile
in
the
afternoon
so
me
and
andy
walked
out
to
the
edge
of
town
to
view
the
mudscape
bird
city
was
built
between
the
rio
grande
and
a
deep
wide
arroyo
that
used
to
be
the
old
bed
of
the
river
the
bank
between
the
stream
and
its
old
bed
was
cracking
and
giving
away
when
we
saw
it
on
account
of
the
high
water
caused
by
the
rain
andy
looks
at
it
a
long
time
that
man
intellects
was
never
idle
and
then
he
unfolds
to
me
a
instantaneous
idea
that
has
occurred
to
him
right
there
was
organized
a
trust
and
we
walked
back
into
town
and
put
it
on
the
market
first
we
went
to
the
main
saloon
in
bird
city
called
the
blue
snake
and
bought
it
it
cost
us
and
then
we
dropped
in
casual
at
mexican
joe
place
referred
to
the
rain
and
bought
him
out
for
the
other
one
came
easy
at
the
next
morning
bird
city
woke
up
and
found
itself
an
island
the
river
had
busted
through
its
old
channel
and
the
town
was
surrounded
by
roaring
torrents
the
rain
was
still
raining
and
there
was
heavy
clouds
in
the
northwest
that
presaged
about
six
more
mean
annual
rainfalls
during
the
next
two
weeks
but
the
worst
was
yet
to
come
bird
city
hopped
out
of
its
nest
waggled
its
pin
feathers
and
strolled
out
for
its
matutinal
toot
lo
mexican
joe
place
was
closed
and
likewise
the
other
little
life
saving
station
so
naturally
the
body
politic
emits
thirsty
ejaculations
of
surprise
and
ports
hellum
for
the
blue
snake
and
what
does
it
find
there
behind
one
end
of
the
bar
sits
jefferson
peters
octopus
with
a
sixshooter
on
each
side
of
him
ready
to
make
change
or
corpses
as
the
case
may
be
there
are
three
bartenders
and
on
the
wall
is
a
ten
foot
sign
reading
drinks
one
dollar
andy
sits
on
the
safe
in
his
neat
blue
suit
and
cigar
on
the
lookout
for
emergencies
the
town
marshal
is
there
with
two
deputies
to
keep
order
having
been
promised
free
drinks
by
the
trust
well
sir
it
took
bird
city
just
ten
minutes
to
realize
that
it
was
in
a
cage
we
expected
trouble
but
there
was
any
the
citizens
saw
that
we
had
the
nearest
railroad
was
thirty
miles
away
and
it
would
be
two
weeks
at
least
before
the
river
would
be
fordable
so
they
began
to
cuss
amiable
and
throw
down
dollars
on
the
bar
till
it
sounded
like
a
selection
on
the
xylophone
there
was
about
adults
in
bird
city
that
had
arrived
at
years
of
indiscretion
and
the
majority
of
required
from
three
to
twenty
drinks
a
day
to
make
life
endurable
the
blue
snake
was
the
only
place
where
they
could
get
till
the
flood
subsided
it
was
beautiful
and
simple
as
all
truly
great
swindles
are
about
ten
the
silver
dollars
dropping
on
the
bar
slowed
down
to
playing
and
marches
instead
of
jigs
but
i
looked
out
the
window
and
saw
a
hundred
or
two
of
our
customers
standing
in
line
at
bird
city
savings
and
loan
and
i
knew
they
were
borrowing
more
money
to
be
sucked
in
by
the
clammy
tendrils
of
the
octopus
at
the
fashionable
hour
of
noon
everybody
went
home
to
dinner
we
told
the
bartenders
to
take
advantage
of
the
lull
and
do
the
same
then
me
and
andy
counted
the
receipts
we
had
taken
in
we
calculated
that
if
bird
city
would
only
remain
an
island
for
two
weeks
the
trust
would
be
able
to
endow
the
chicago
university
with
a
new
dormitory
of
padded
cells
for
the
faculty
and
present
every
worthy
poor
man
in
texas
with
a
farm
provided
he
furnished
the
site
for
it
andy
was
especial
inroaded
by
at
our
success
the
rudiments
of
the
scheme
having
originated
in
his
own
surmises
and
premonitions
he
got
off
the
safe
and
lit
the
biggest
cigar
in
the
house
illustration
andy
was
especial
inroaded
by
says
he
do
suppose
that
anywhere
in
the
world
you
could
find
three
cormorants
with
brighter
ideas
about
the
proletariat
than
the
firm
of
peters
satan
and
tucker
incorporated
we
have
sure
handed
the
small
consumer
a
giant
blow
in
the
sole
apoplectic
region
no
says
i
does
look
as
if
we
would
have
to
take
up
gastritis
and
golf
or
be
measured
for
kilts
in
spite
of
ourselves
this
little
turn
in
bug
juice
is
verily
all
to
the
skibo
and
i
can
stand
it
says
i
rather
batten
than
bant
any
day
andy
pours
himself
out
four
fingers
of
our
best
rye
and
does
with
it
as
was
so
intended
it
was
the
first
drink
i
had
ever
known
him
to
take
way
of
liberation
says
he
the
gods
and
then
after
thus
doing
umbrage
to
the
heathen
diabetes
he
drinks
another
to
our
success
and
then
he
begins
to
toast
the
trade
beginning
with
raisuli
and
the
northern
pacific
and
on
down
the
line
to
the
little
ones
like
the
school
book
combine
and
the
oleomargarine
outrages
and
the
lehigh
valley
and
great
scott
coal
federation
all
right
andy
says
i
drink
the
health
of
our
brother
monopolists
but
do
overdo
the
wassail
you
know
our
most
eminent
and
loathed
live
on
weak
tea
and
dog
biscuits
andy
went
in
the
back
room
awhile
and
came
out
dressed
in
his
best
clothes
there
was
a
kind
of
murderous
and
soulful
look
of
gentle
riotousness
in
his
eye
that
i
did
like
i
watched
him
to
see
what
turn
the
whiskey
was
going
to
take
in
him
there
are
two
times
when
you
never
can
tell
what
is
going
to
happen
one
is
when
a
man
takes
his
first
drink
and
the
other
is
when
a
woman
takes
her
latest
in
less
than
an
hour
andy
skate
had
turned
to
an
ice
yacht
he
was
outwardly
decent
and
managed
to
preserve
his
aquarium
but
inside
he
was
impromptu
and
full
of
unexpectedness
says
he
you
know
that
i
a
crater
a
living
crater
a
hypothesis
says
i
you
not
irish
why
do
you
say
according
to
the
rules
and
syntax
of
america
the
crater
of
a
volcano
says
he
all
aflame
and
crammed
inside
with
an
assortment
of
words
and
phrases
that
have
got
to
have
an
exodus
i
can
feel
millions
of
synonyms
and
parts
of
speech
rising
in
me
says
he
i
got
to
make
a
speech
of
some
sort
drink
says
andy
drives
me
to
oratory
could
do
no
worse
says
i
my
earliest
recollections
says
he
seemed
to
stimulate
my
sense
of
recitation
and
rhetoric
why
in
bryan
second
campaign
says
andy
used
to
give
me
three
gin
rickeys
and
i
speak
two
hours
longer
than
billy
himself
could
on
the
silver
question
finally
they
persuaded
me
to
take
the
gold
cure
you
got
to
get
rid
of
your
excess
verbiage
says
i
not
go
out
on
the
river
bank
and
speak
a
piece
it
seems
to
me
there
was
an
old
named
cantharides
that
used
to
go
and
disincorporate
himself
of
his
windy
numbers
along
the
seashore
says
andy
must
have
an
audience
i
feel
like
if
i
once
turned
loose
people
would
begin
to
call
senator
beveridge
the
grand
young
sphinx
of
the
wabash
i
got
to
get
an
audience
together
jeff
and
get
this
oral
distension
assuaged
or
it
may
turn
in
on
me
and
i
go
about
feeling
like
a
edition
de
luxe
of
n
southworth
what
special
subject
of
the
theorems
and
topics
does
your
desire
for
vocality
seem
to
be
connected
with
i
asks
ai
particular
says
andy
am
equally
good
and
varicose
on
all
subjects
i
can
take
up
the
matter
of
russian
immigration
or
the
poetry
of
john
keats
or
the
tariff
or
kabyle
literature
or
drainage
and
make
my
audience
weep
cry
sob
and
shed
tears
by
turns
andy
says
i
you
are
bound
to
get
rid
of
this
accumulation
of
vernacular
suppose
you
go
out
in
town
and
work
it
on
some
indulgent
citizen
me
and
the
boys
will
take
care
of
the
business
everybody
will
be
through
dinner
pretty
soon
and
salt
pork
and
beans
makes
a
man
pretty
thirsty
we
ought
to
take
in
more
by
midnight
so
andy
goes
out
of
the
blue
snake
and
i
see
him
stopping
men
on
the
street
and
talking
to
by
and
by
he
has
half
a
dozen
in
a
bunch
listening
to
him
and
pretty
soon
i
see
him
waving
his
arms
and
elocuting
at
a
crowd
on
a
corner
when
he
walks
away
they
string
out
after
him
talking
all
the
time
and
he
leads
down
the
main
street
of
bird
city
with
more
men
joining
the
procession
as
they
go
it
reminded
me
of
the
old
legerdemain
that
i
read
in
books
about
the
pied
piper
of
heidsieck
charming
the
children
away
from
the
town
illustration
and
he
leads
down
the
main
street
of
bird
city
one
came
and
then
two
and
three
got
under
the
wire
for
place
and
not
a
bird
citizen
came
in
for
a
drink
the
streets
were
deserted
except
for
some
ducks
and
ladies
going
to
the
stores
there
was
only
a
light
drizzle
falling
then
a
lonesome
man
came
along
and
stopped
in
front
of
the
blue
snake
to
scrape
the
mud
off
his
boots
says
i
has
happened
this
morning
there
was
hectic
gaiety
afoot
and
now
it
seems
more
like
one
of
them
ruined
cities
of
tyre
and
siphon
where
the
lone
lizard
crawls
on
the
walls
of
the
main
whole
town
says
the
muddy
man
up
in
sperry
wool
warehouse
listening
to
your
make
a
speech
he
is
some
gravy
on
delivering
himself
of
audible
sounds
relating
to
matters
and
conclusions
says
the
man
i
hope
he
adjourn
sine
qua
non
pretty
soon
says
i
trade
languishes
not
a
customer
did
we
have
that
afternoon
at
six
two
mexicans
brought
andy
to
the
saloon
lying
across
the
back
of
a
burro
we
put
him
in
bed
while
he
still
muttered
and
gesticulated
with
his
hands
and
feet
then
i
locked
up
the
cash
and
went
out
to
see
what
had
happened
i
met
a
man
who
told
me
all
about
it
andy
had
made
the
finest
two
hour
speech
that
had
ever
been
heard
in
texas
he
said
or
anywhere
else
in
the
world
was
it
about
i
asked
says
he
when
he
got
through
every
man
in
bird
city
signed
the
pledge
for
a
year
jeff
peters
as
a
personal
magnet
jeff
peters
has
been
engaged
in
as
many
schemes
for
making
money
as
there
are
recipes
for
cooking
rice
in
charleston
best
of
all
i
like
to
hear
him
tell
of
his
earlier
days
when
he
sold
liniments
and
cough
cures
on
street
corners
living
hand
to
mouth
heart
to
heart
with
the
people
throwing
heads
or
tails
with
fortune
for
his
last
coin
i
struck
fisher
hill
arkansaw
said
he
in
a
buckskin
suit
moccasins
long
hair
and
a
diamond
ring
that
i
got
from
an
actor
in
texarkana
i
do
know
what
he
ever
did
with
the
pocket
knife
i
swapped
him
for
it
i
was
the
celebrated
indian
medicine
man
i
carried
only

off
like
at

had
sold
two
dozen

fifty
cents
apiece
when
i
felt
somebody
pull
my
coat
tail
i
knew
what
that
meant
so
i
climbed
down
and
sneaked
a
five
dollar
bill
into
the
hand
of
a
man
with
a
german
silver
star
on
his
lapel

and
waits
by

by
a
young

satisfied
with

profit
he
had
plenty
of
offers
to

mayor
says
i
time
will
come
soon
when

is
a
success

you
be
sure
that

gate
i
says

now
andy
i
reckon

capital
to
go
into
business
together
modern
rural
sports
jeff
peters
must
be
reminded
whenever
he
is
called
upon
pointedly
for
a
story
he
will
maintain
that
his
life
has
been
as
devoid
of
incident
as
the
longest
of
trollope
novels
but
lured
he
will
divulge
therefore
i
cast
many
and
divers
flies
upon
the
current
of
his
thoughts
before
i
feel
a
nibble
i
notice
said
i
that
the
western
farmers
in
spite
of
their
prosperity
are
running
after
their
old
populistic
idols
again
it
the
running
season
said
jeff
for
farmers
shad
maple
trees
and
the
connemaugh
river
i
know
something
about
farmers
i
thought
i
struck
one
once
that
had
got
out
of
the
rut
but
andy
tucker
proved
to
me
i
was
mistaken
a
farmer
always
a
sucker
said
andy
the
man
that
shoved
into
the
front
row
among
bullets
ballots
and
the
ballet
he
the
and
gristle
of
the
country
said
andy
i
do
know
who
we
would
do
without
him
one
morning
me
and
andy
wakes
up
with
cents
between
us
in
a
yellow
pine
hotel
on
the
edge
of
the
belt
of
southern
indiana
how
we
got
off
the
train
there
the
night
before
i
ca
tell
you
for
she
went
through
the
village
so
fast
that
what
looked
like
a
saloon
to
us
through
the
car
window
turned
out
to
be
a
composite
view
of
a
drug
store
and
a
water
tank
two
blocks
apart
why
we
got
off
at
the
first
station
we
could
belongs
to
a
little
oroide
gold
watch
and
alaska
diamond
deal
we
failed
to
pull
off
the
day
before
over
the
kentucky
line
when
i
woke
up
i
heard
roosters
crowing
and
smelt
something
like
the
fumes
of
acid
and
heard
something
heavy
fall
on
the
floor
below
us
and
a
man
swearing
up
andy
says
i
in
a
rural
community
somebody
has
just
tested
a
gold
brick
downstairs
we
go
out
and
get
coming
to
us
from
a
farmer
and
then
yoicks
and
away
farmers
was
always
a
kind
of
reserve
fund
to
me
whenever
i
was
in
hard
luck
i
go
to
the
crossroads
hook
a
finger
in
a
suspender
recite
the
prospectus
of
my
swindle
in
a
mechanical
kind
of
a
way
look
over
what
he
had
give
him
back
his
keys
whetstone
and
papers
that
was
of
no
value
except
to
owner
and
stroll
away
without
asking
any
questions
farmers
are
not
fair
game
to
me
as
high
up
in
our
business
as
me
and
andy
was
but
there
was
times
when
we
found
useful
just
as
wall
street
does
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
now
and
then
when
we
went
down
stairs
we
saw
we
was
in
the
midst
of
the
finest
farming
section
we
ever
see
about
two
miles
away
on
a
hill
was
a
big
white
house
in
a
grove
surrounded
by
a
agricultural
agglomeration
of
fields
and
barns
and
pastures
and
house
is
that
we
asked
the
landlord
says
he
the
domicile
and
the
arboreal
terrestrial
and
horticultural
accessories
of
farmer
ezra
plunkett
one
of
our
county
most
progressive
citizens
after
breakfast
me
and
andy
with
eight
cents
capital
left
casts
the
horoscope
of
the
rural
potentate
me
go
alone
says
i
of
us
against
one
farmer
would
look
as
as
roosevelt
using
both
hands
to
kill
a
grizzly
right
says
andy
like
to
be
a
true
sport
even
when
i
only
collecting
rebates
from
the
rutabag
raisers
what
bait
are
you
going
to
use
for
this
ezra
thing
andy
asks
me
i
says
first
thing
that
come
to
hand
in
the
suit
case
i
reckon
i
take
along
some
of
the
new
income
tax
receipts
and
the
recipe
for
making
clover
honey
out
of
clabber
and
apple
peelings
and
the
order
blanks
for
the
mcguffey
readers
which
afterwards
turn
out
to
be
mccormick
reapers
and
the
pearl
necklace
found
on
the
train
and
a
goldbrick
and
a
be
enough
says
andy
one
of
the
lot
ought
to
land
on
ezra
and
say
jeff
make
that
succotash
fancier
give
you
nice
clean
new
bills
it
a
disgrace
to
our
department
of
agriculture
civil
service
and
pure
food
law
the
kind
of
stuff
some
of
these
farmers
hand
out
to
use
i
had
to
take
rolls
from
that
looked
like
bundles
of
microbe
cultures
captured
out
of
a
red
cross
ambulance
so
i
goes
to
a
livery
stable
and
hires
a
buggy
on
my
looks
i
drove
out
to
the
plunkett
farm
and
hitched
there
was
a
man
sitting
on
the
front
steps
of
the
house
he
had
on
a
white
flannel
suit
a
diamond
ring
golf
cap
and
a
pink
ascot
tie
boarder
says
i
to
myself
like
to
see
farmer
ezra
plunkett
says
i
to
him
see
him
says
he
seems
to
be
on
your
mind
i
never
answered
a
word
i
stood
still
repeating
to
myself
the
rollicking
lines
of
that
merry
jingle
man
with
the
hoe
when
i
looked
at
this
farmer
the
little
devices
i
had
in
my
pocket
for
buncoing
the
brows
seemed
as
hopeless
as
trying
to
shake
down
the
beef
trust
with
a
mittimus
and
a
parlor
rifle
says
he
looking
at
me
close
up
i
see
the
left
pocket
of
your
coat
sags
a
good
deal
out
with
the
goldbrick
first
i
rather
more
interested
in
the
bricks
than
i
am
in
the
trick
notes
and
the
lost
silver
mine
story
i
had
a
kind
of
cerebral
sensation
of
foolishness
in
my
ideas
of
ratiocination
but
i
pulled
out
the
little
brick
and
unwrapped
my
handkerchief
off
it
dollar
and
eighty
cents
says
the
farmer
hefting
it
in
his
hand
it
a
trade
lead
in
it
is
worth
more
than
that
says
i
dignified
i
put
it
back
in
my
pocket
right
says
he
i
sort
of
wanted
it
for
the
collection
starting
i
got
a
one
last
week
for
just
then
a
telephone
bell
rings
in
the
house
in
bunk
says
the
farmer
look
at
my
place
it
kind
of
lonesome
here
sometimes
i
think
that
new
york
calling
we
went
inside
the
room
looked
like
a
broadway
stockbroker
light
oak
desks
two
spanish
leather
upholstered
chairs
and
couches
oil
paintings
in
gilt
frames
a
foot
deep
and
a
ticker
hitting
off
the
news
in
one
corner
hello
says
this
funny
farmer
that
the
regent
theatre
yes
this
is
plunkett
of
woodbine
centre
reserve
four
orchestra
seats
for
friday
evening
my
usual
ones
yes
friday
run
over
to
new
york
every
two
weeks
to
see
a
show
says
the
farmer
hanging
up
the
receiver
catch
the
flyer
at
indianapolis
spend
ten
hours
in
the
heyday
of
night
on
the
yappian
way
and
get
home
in
time
to
see
the
chickens
go
to
roost
hours
later
oh
the
pristine
hubbard
squasherino
of
the
period
is
getting
geared
up
some
for
the
annual
meeting
of
the
association
do
you
think
mr
bunk
seem
to
perceive
says
i
kind
of
hiatus
in
the
agrarian
traditions
in
which
heretofore
i
have
reposed
confidence
bunk
says
he
yellow
primrose
on
the
river
brim
is
getting
to
look
to
us
reubs
like
a
holiday
edition
de
luxe
of
the
language
of
flowers
with
deckle
edges
and
frontispiece
just
then
the
telephone
calls
him
again
hello
says
he
that
perkins
at
milldale
i
told
you
was
too
much
for
that
horse
have
you
got
him
there
good
let
me
see
him
get
away
from
the
transmitter
now
make
him
trot
in
a
circle
faster
yes
i
can
hear
him
keep
on
faster
yet
that
do
now
lead
him
up
to
the
phone
closer
get
his
nose
nearer
there
now
wait
no
i
do
want
that
horse
what
no
not
at
any
price
he
interferes
and
he
windbroken
goodbye
bunk
says
the
farmer
you
begin
to
realize
that
agriculture
has
had
a
hair
cut
you
belong
in
a
bygone
era
why
tom
lawson
himself
knows
better
than
to
try
to
catch
an
agriculturalist
napping
it
saturday
the
fourteenth
on
the
farm
you
bet
now
look
here
and
see
how
we
keep
up
with
the
doings
he
shows
me
a
machine
on
a
table
with
two
things
for
your
ears
like
the
affairs
i
puts
it
on
and
listens
a
female
voice
starts
up
reading
headlines
of
murders
accidents
and
other
political
casualities
you
hear
says
the
farmer
a
synopsis
of
news
in
the
new
york
chicago
louis
and
san
francisco
papers
it
is
wired
in
to
our
rural
news
bureau
and
served
hot
to
subscribers
on
this
table
you
see
the
principal
dailies
and
weeklies
of
the
country
also
a
special
service
of
advance
sheets
of
the
monthly
magazines
i
picks
up
one
sheet
and
sees
that
it
headed
advance
proofs
in
july
the
will
say
and
so
forth
the
farmer
rings
up
somebody
his
manager
i
reckon
and
tells
him
to
let
that
herd
of
jerseys
go
at
a
head
and
to
sow
the
field
in
wheat
and
to
have
extra
cans
ready
at
the
station
for
the
milk
trolley
car
then
he
passes
the
henry
clays
and
sets
out
a
bottle
of
green
chartreuse
and
goes
over
and
looks
at
the
ticker
tape
gas
up
two
points
says
he
very
well
monkey
with
copper
i
asks
back
says
he
raising
his
hand
i
call
the
dog
i
told
you
not
to
waste
your
time
after
a
while
he
says
if
you
do
mind
my
telling
you
your
company
begins
to
cloy
slightly
i
got
to
write
an
article
on
the
chimera
of
communism
for
a
magazine
and
attend
a
meeting
of
the
race
track
association
this
afternoon
of
course
you
understand
by
now
that
you
ca
get
my
proxy
for
your
remedy
whatever
it
may
be
well
sir
all
i
could
think
of
to
do
was
to
go
out
and
get
in
the
buggy
the
horse
turned
round
and
took
me
back
to
the
hotel
i
hitched
him
and
went
in
to
see
andy
in
his
room
i
told
him
about
this
farmer
word
for
word
and
i
sat
picking
at
the
table
cover
like
one
bereft
of
sagaciousness
do
understand
it
says
i
humming
a
sad
and
foolish
little
song
to
cover
my
humiliation
andy
walks
up
and
down
the
room
for
a
long
time
biting
the
left
end
of
his
mustache
as
he
does
when
in
the
act
of
thinking
says
he
finally
believe
your
story
of
this
expurgated
rustic
but
i
am
not
convinced
it
looks
incredulous
to
me
that
he
could
have
inoculated
himself
against
all
the
preordained
systems
of
bucolic
bunco
now
you
never
regarded
me
as
a
man
of
special
religious
proclivities
did
you
jeff
says
andy
says
i
but
says
i
not
to
wound
his
feelings
have
also
observed
many
church
members
whose
said
proclivities
were
not
so
outwardly
developed
that
they
would
show
on
a
white
handkerchief
if
you
rubbed
with
it
have
always
been
a
deep
student
of
nature
from
creation
down
says
andy
i
believe
in
an
ultimatum
design
of
providence
farmers
was
made
for
a
purpose
and
that
was
to
furnish
a
livelihood
to
men
like
me
and
you
else
why
was
we
given
brains
it
is
my
belief
that
the
manna
that
the
israelites
lived
on
for
forty
years
in
the
wilderness
was
only
a
figurative
word
for
farmers
and
they
kept
up
the
practice
to
this
day
and
now
says
andy
am
going
to
test
my
theory
once
a
farmer
always
a
in
spite
of
the
veneering
and
the
orifices
that
a
spurious
civilization
has
brought
to
him
fail
same
as
i
did
says
i
one
shook
off
the
shackles
of
the
he
entrenched
behind
the
advantages
of
electricity
education
literature
and
intelligence
try
said
andy
are
certain
laws
of
nature
that
free
rural
delivery
ca
overcome
andy
fumbles
around
awhile
in
the
closet
and
comes
out
dressed
in
a
suit
with
brown
and
yellow
checks
as
big
as
your
hand
his
vest
is
red
with
blue
dots
and
he
wears
a
high
silk
hat
i
noticed
he
soaked
his
sandy
mustache
in
a
kind
of
blue
ink
barnums
says
i
a
ringer
for
a
circus
thimblerig
man
says
andy
the
buggy
outside
wait
here
till
i
come
back
i
wo
be
long
two
hours
afterwards
andy
steps
into
the
room
and
lays
a
wad
of
money
on
the
table
hundred
and
sixty
dollars
said
he
me
tell
you
he
was
in
he
looked
me
over
and
began
to
guy
me
i
did
say
a
word
but
got
out
the
walnut
shells
and
began
to
roll
the
little
ball
on
the
table
i
whistled
a
tune
or
two
and
then
i
started
up
the
old
formula
up
lively
gentlemen
says
i
watch
the
little
ball
it
costs
you
nothing
to
look
there
you
see
it
and
there
you
do
guess
where
the
little
joker
is
the
quickness
of
the
hand
deceives
the
eye
steals
a
look
at
the
farmer
man
i
see
the
sweat
coming
out
on
his
forehead
he
goes
over
and
closes
the
front
door
and
watches
me
some
more
directly
he
says
i
bet
you
twenty
i
can
pick
the
shell
the
ball
under
now
that
goes
on
andy
is
nothing
new
to
relate
he
only
had
cash
in
the
house
when
i
left
he
followed
me
to
the
gate
there
was
tears
in
his
eyes
when
he
shook
hands
bunk
says
he
thank
you
for
the
only
real
pleasure
i
had
in
years
it
brings
up
happy
old
days
when
i
was
only
a
farmer
and
not
an
agriculturalist
god
bless
you
here
jeff
peters
ceased
and
i
inferred
that
his
story
was
done
then
you
think
i
began
yes
said
jeff
something
like
that
you
let
the
farmers
go
ahead
and
amuse
themselves
with
politics
farming
a
lonesome
life
and
they
been
against
the
shell
game
before
the
chair
of
philanthromathematics
i
see
that
the
cause
of
education
has
received
the
princely
gift
of
more
than
fifty
millions
of
dollars
said
i
was
gleaning
the
stray
items
from
the
evening
papers
while
jeff
peters
packed
his
briar
pipe
with
plug
cut
which
same
said
jeff
calls
for
a
new
deck
and
a
recitation
by
the
entire
class
in
philanthromathematics
is
that
an
allusion
i
asked
it
is
said
jeff
i
never
told
you
about
the
time
when
me
and
andy
tucker
was
philanthropists
did
i
it
was
eight
years
ago
in
arizona
andy
and
me
was
out
in
the
gila
mountains
with
a
wagon
prospecting
for
silver
we
struck
it
and
sold
out
to
parties
in
tucson
for
they
paid
our
check
at
the
bank
in
silver
a
thousand
dollars
in
a
sack
we
loaded
it
in
our
wagon
and
drove
east
a
hundred
miles
before
we
recovered
our
presence
of
intellect
thousand
dollars
does
sound
like
so
much
when
reading
the
annual
report
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
or
listening
to
an
actor
talking
about
his
salary
but
when
you
can
raise
up
a
wagon
sheet
and
kick
around
your
bootheel
and
hear
every
one
of
ring
against
another
it
makes
you
feel
like
you
was
a
bank
with
the
clock
striking
twelve
the
third
day
out
we
drove
into
one
of
the
most
specious
and
tidy
little
towns
that
nature
or
rand
and
mcnally
ever
turned
out
it
was
in
the
foothills
and
mitigated
with
trees
and
flowers
and
about
head
of
cordial
and
dilatory
inhabitants
the
town
seemed
to
be
called
floresville
and
nature
had
not
contaminated
it
with
many
railroads
fleas
or
eastern
tourists
me
and
andy
deposited
our
money
to
the
credit
of
peters
and
tucker
in
the
esperanza
savings
bank
and
got
rooms
at
the
skyview
hotel
after
supper
we
lit
up
and
sat
out
on
the
gallery
and
smoked
then
was
when
the
philanthropy
idea
struck
me
i
suppose
every
grafter
gets
it
sometime
when
a
man
swindles
the
public
out
of
a
certain
amount
he
begins
to
get
scared
and
wants
to
return
part
of
it
and
if
you
watch
close
and
notice
the
way
his
charity
runs
you
see
that
he
tries
to
restore
it
to
the
same
people
he
got
it
from
as
a
hydrostatical
case
take
let
say
a
a
made
his
millions
selling
oil
to
poor
students
who
sit
up
nights
studying
political
economy
and
methods
for
regulating
the
trusts
so
back
to
the
universities
and
colleges
goes
his
conscience
dollars
there
b
got
his
from
the
common
laboring
man
that
works
with
his
hands
and
tools
how
he
to
get
some
of
the
remorse
fund
back
into
their
overalls
says
b
do
it
in
the
name
of
education
i
skinned
the
laboring
man
says
he
to
himself
according
to
the
old
proverb
charity
covers
a
multitude
of
skins
so
he
puts
up
eighty
million
dollars
worth
of
libraries
and
the
boys
with
the
dinner
pail
that
builds
gets
the
benefit
the
books
asks
the
reading
public
dinna
ken
says
b
offered
ye
libraries
and
there
they
are
i
suppose
if
i
given
ye
preferred
steel
trust
stock
instead
ye
have
wanted
the
water
in
it
set
out
in
cut
glass
decanters
hoot
for
ye
but
as
i
said
the
owning
of
so
much
money
was
beginning
to
give
me
philanthropitis
it
was
the
first
time
me
and
andy
had
ever
made
a
pile
big
enough
to
make
us
stop
and
think
how
we
got
it
says
i
wealthy
not
beyond
the
dreams
of
average
but
in
our
humble
way
we
are
comparatively
as
rich
as
greasers
i
feel
as
if
i
like
to
do
something
for
as
well
as
to
humanity
was
thinking
the
same
thing
jeff
says
he
been
gouging
the
public
for
a
long
time
with
all
kinds
of
little
schemes
from
selling
celluloid
collars
to
flooding
georgia
with
hoke
smith
presidential
campaign
buttons
i
like
myself
to
hedge
a
bet
or
two
in
the
graft
game
if
i
could
do
it
without
actually
banging
the
cymbalines
in
the
salvation
army
or
teaching
a
bible
class
by
the
bertillon
system
we
do
says
andy
free
grub
to
the
poor
or
send
a
couple
of
thousand
to
george
cortelyou
says
i
got
too
much
money
to
be
implicated
in
plain
charity
and
we
have
got
enough
to
make
restitution
so
we
look
about
for
something
that
about
half
way
between
the
two
the
next
day
in
walking
around
floresville
we
see
on
a
hill
a
big
red
brick
building
that
appears
to
be
disinhabited
the
citizens
speak
up
and
tell
us
that
it
was
begun
for
a
residence
several
years
before
by
a
mine
owner
after
running
up
the
house
he
finds
he
only
had
left
to
furnish
it
with
so
he
invests
that
in
whiskey
and
jumps
off
the
roof
on
a
spot
where
he
now
requiescats
in
pieces
as
soon
as
me
and
andy
saw
that
building
the
same
idea
struck
both
of
us
we
would
fix
it
up
with
lights
and
pen
wipers
and
professors
and
put
an
iron
dog
and
statues
of
hercules
and
father
john
on
the
lawn
and
start
one
of
the
finest
free
educational
institutions
in
the
world
right
there
so
we
talks
it
over
to
the
prominent
citizens
of
floresville
who
falls
in
fine
with
the
idea
they
give
a
banquet
in
the
engine
house
to
us
and
we
make
our
bow
for
the
first
time
as
benefactors
to
the
cause
of
progress
and
enlightenment
andy
makes
an
speech
on
the
subject
of
irrigation
in
lower
egypt
and
we
have
a
moral
tune
on
the
phonograph
and
pineapple
sherbet
andy
and
me
did
lose
any
time
in
philanthropping
we
put
every
man
in
town
that
could
tell
a
hammer
from
a
step
ladder
to
work
on
the
building
dividing
it
up
into
class
rooms
and
lecture
halls
we
wire
to
frisco
for
a
car
load
of
desks
footballs
arithmetics
penholders
dictionaries
chairs
for
the
professors
slates
skeletons
sponges
cravenetted
gowns
and
caps
for
the
senior
class
and
an
open
order
for
all
the
truck
that
goes
with
a
university
i
took
it
on
myself
to
put
a
campus
and
a
curriculum
on
the
list
but
the
telegraph
operator
must
have
got
the
words
wrong
being
an
ignorant
man
for
when
the
goods
come
we
found
a
can
of
peas
and
a
among
while
the
weekly
papers
was
having
cuts
of
me
and
andy
we
wired
an
employment
agency
in
chicago
to
express
us
six
professors
immediately
one
english
literature
one
dead
languages
one
chemistry
one
political
economy
democrat
preferred
one
logic
and
one
wise
to
painting
italian
and
music
with
union
card
the
esperanza
bank
guaranteed
salaries
which
was
to
run
between
and
well
sir
we
finally
got
in
shape
over
the
front
door
was
carved
the
words
world
university
peters
tucker
patrons
and
proprietors
and
when
september
the
first
got
a
on
the
calendar
the
begun
to
roll
in
first
the
faculty
got
off
the
express
from
tucson
they
was
mostly
young
spectacled
and
with
sentiments
divided
between
ambition
and
food
andy
and
me
got
billeted
on
the
floresvillians
and
then
laid
for
the
students
they
came
in
bunches
we
had
advertised
the
university
in
all
the
state
papers
and
it
did
us
good
to
see
how
quick
the
country
responded
two
hundred
and
nineteen
husky
lads
aging
along
from
up
to
chin
whiskers
answered
the
clarion
call
of
free
education
they
ripped
open
that
town
sponged
the
seams
turned
it
lined
it
with
new
mohair
and
you
could
have
told
it
from
harvard
or
goldfields
at
the
march
term
of
court
they
marched
up
and
down
the
streets
waving
flags
with
the
university
colors
and
blue
and
they
certainly
made
a
lively
place
of
floresville
andy
made
them
a
speech
from
the
balcony
of
the
skyview
hotel
and
the
whole
town
was
out
celebrating
in
about
two
weeks
the
professors
got
the
students
disarmed
and
herded
into
classes
i
do
believe
there
any
pleasure
equal
to
being
a
philanthropist
me
and
andy
bought
high
silk
hats
and
pretended
to
dodge
the
two
reporters
of
the
floresville
gazette
the
paper
had
a
man
to
kodak
us
whenever
we
appeared
on
the
street
and
ran
our
pictures
every
week
over
the
column
headed
notes
andy
lectured
twice
a
week
at
the
university
and
afterward
i
would
rise
and
tell
a
humorous
story
once
the
gazette
printed
my
pictures
with
abe
lincoln
on
one
side
and
marshall
wilder
on
the
other
andy
was
as
interested
in
philanthropy
as
i
was
we
used
to
wake
up
of
nights
and
tell
each
other
new
ideas
for
booming
the
university
says
i
to
him
one
day
something
we
overlooked
the
boys
ought
to
have
dromedaries
that
andy
asks
something
to
sleep
in
of
course
says
i
colleges
have
you
mean
pajamas
says
andy
do
not
says
i
mean
dromedaries
but
i
never
could
make
andy
understand
so
we
never
ordered
of
course
i
meant
them
long
bedrooms
in
colleges
where
the
scholars
sleep
in
a
row
well
sir
the
world
university
was
a
success
we
had
scholars
from
five
states
and
territories
and
floresville
had
a
boom
a
new
shooting
gallery
and
a
pawn
shop
and
two
more
saloons
started
and
the
boys
got
up
a
college
yell
that
went
this
way
raw
raw
done
done
done
peters
tucker
lots
of
fun
world
university
hip
hurrah
the
scholars
was
a
fine
lot
of
young
men
and
me
and
andy
was
as
proud
of
as
if
they
belonged
to
our
own
family
but
one
day
about
the
last
of
october
andy
comes
to
me
and
asks
if
i
have
any
idea
how
much
money
we
had
left
in
the
bank
i
guesses
about
sixteen
thousand
balance
says
andy
says
i
with
a
kind
of
a
yell
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
them
infernal
sons
of
horse
thieves
have
soaked
us
for
that
much
less
says
andy
to
helvetia
with
philanthropy
says
i
necessarily
says
andy
says
he
run
on
a
good
business
basis
is
one
of
the
best
grafts
going
i
look
into
the
matter
and
see
if
it
ca
be
straightened
out
the
next
week
i
am
looking
over
the
payroll
of
our
faculty
when
i
run
across
a
new
name
professor
james
darnley
mccorkle
chair
of
mathematics
salary
per
week
i
yells
so
loud
that
andy
runs
in
quick
this
says
i
professor
of
mathematics
at
more
than
a
year
how
did
this
happen
did
he
get
in
through
the
window
and
appoint
himself
wired
to
frisco
for
him
a
week
ago
says
andy
ordering
the
faculty
we
seemed
to
have
overlooked
the
chair
of
mathematics
good
thing
we
did
says
i
can
pay
his
salary
two
weeks
and
then
our
philanthropy
will
look
like
the
ninth
hole
on
the
skibo
golf
links
a
while
says
andy
see
how
things
turn
out
we
have
taken
up
too
noble
a
cause
to
draw
out
now
besides
the
further
i
gaze
into
the
retail
philanthropy
business
the
better
it
looks
to
me
i
never
thought
about
investigating
it
before
come
to
think
of
it
now
goes
on
andy
the
philanthropists
i
ever
knew
had
plenty
of
money
i
ought
to
have
looked
into
that
matter
long
ago
and
located
which
was
the
cause
and
which
was
the
effect
i
had
confidence
in
andy
chicanery
in
financial
affairs
so
i
left
the
whole
thing
in
his
hands
the
university
was
flourishing
fine
and
me
and
andy
kept
our
silk
hats
shined
up
and
floresville
kept
on
heaping
honors
on
us
like
we
was
millionaires
instead
of
almost
busted
philanthropists
the
students
kept
the
town
lively
and
prosperous
some
stranger
came
to
town
and
started
a
faro
bank
over
the
red
front
livery
stable
and
began
to
amass
money
in
quantities
me
and
andy
strolled
up
one
night
and
piked
a
dollar
or
two
for
sociability
there
were
about
fifty
of
our
students
there
drinking
rum
punches
and
shoving
high
stacks
of
blues
and
reds
about
the
table
as
the
dealer
turned
the
cards
up
dang
it
andy
says
i
little
sons
of
have
got
more
money
than
you
and
me
ever
had
look
at
the
rolls
they
pulling
out
of
their
pistol
pockets
says
andy
good
many
of
them
are
sons
of
wealthy
miners
and
stockmen
it
very
sad
to
see
wasting
their
opportunities
this
way
at
christmas
all
the
students
went
home
to
spend
the
holidays
we
had
a
farewell
blowout
at
the
university
and
andy
lectured
on
music
and
prehistoric
literature
of
the
archipelagos
each
one
of
the
faculty
answered
to
toasts
and
compared
me
and
andy
to
rockefeller
and
the
emperor
marcus
autolycus
i
pounded
on
the
table
and
yelled
for
professor
mccorkle
but
it
seems
he
was
present
on
the
occasion
i
wanted
a
look
at
the
man
that
andy
thought
could
earn
a
week
in
philanthropy
that
was
on
the
point
of
making
an
assignment
the
students
all
left
on
the
night
train
and
the
town
sounded
as
quiet
as
the
campus
of
a
correspondence
school
at
midnight
when
i
went
to
the
hotel
i
saw
a
light
in
andy
room
and
i
opened
the
door
and
walked
in
there
sat
andy
and
the
faro
dealer
at
a
table
dividing
a
high
stack
of
currency
in
packages
says
andy
thousand
apiece
come
in
jeff
says
he
is
our
share
of
the
profits
of
the
first
half
of
the
scholastic
term
of
the
world
university
incorporated
and
philanthropated
are
you
convinced
now
says
andy
philanthropy
when
practiced
in
a
business
way
is
an
art
that
blesses
him
who
gives
as
well
as
him
who
receives
says
i
feeling
fine
admit
you
are
the
doctor
this
time
be
leaving
on
the
morning
train
says
andy
better
get
your
collars
and
cuffs
and
press
clippings
together
says
i
be
ready
but
andy
says
i
wish
i
could
have
met
that
professor
james
darnley
mccorkle
before
we
went
i
had
a
curiosity
to
know
that
man
be
easy
says
andy
turning
around
to
the
faro
dealer
says
andy
hands
with
mr
peters
the
hand
that
riles
the
world
many
of
our
great
men
said
i
apropos
of
many
things
have
declared
that
they
owe
their
success
to
the
aid
and
encouragement
of
some
brilliant
woman
i
know
said
jeff
peters
i
read
in
history
and
mythology
about
joan
of
arc
and
mme
yale
and
caudle
and
eve
and
other
noted
females
of
the
past
but
in
my
opinion
the
woman
of
is
of
little
use
in
politics
or
business
what
she
best
in
anyway
men
make
the
best
cooks
milliners
nurses
housekeepers
stenographers
clerks
hairdressers
and
launderers
about
the
only
job
left
that
a
woman
can
beat
a
man
in
is
female
impersonator
in
vaudeville
i
would
have
thought
said
i
that
occasionally
anyhow
you
would
have
found
the
wit
and
intuition
of
woman
valuable
to
you
in
your
lines
of
er
business
now
would
you
said
jeff
with
an
emphatic
nod
would
you
have
imagined
that
but
a
woman
is
an
absolutely
unreliable
partner
in
any
straight
swindle
she
liable
to
turn
honest
on
you
when
you
are
depending
upon
her
the
most
i
tried
once
bill
humble
an
old
friend
of
mine
in
the
territories
conceived
the
illusion
that
he
wanted
to
be
appointed
united
states
marshall
at
that
time
me
and
andy
was
doing
a
square
legitimate
business
of
selling
walking
canes
if
you
unscrewed
the
head
of
one
and
turned
it
up
to
your
mouth
a
half
pint
of
good
rye
whiskey
would
go
trickling
down
your
throat
to
reward
you
for
your
act
of
intelligence
the
deputies
was
annoying
me
and
andy
some
and
when
bill
spoke
to
me
about
his
officious
aspirations
i
saw
how
the
appointment
as
marshall
might
help
along
the
firm
of
peters
tucker
illustration
selling
walking
canes
says
bill
to
me
are
a
man
of
learning
and
education
besides
having
knowledge
and
information
concerning
not
only
rudiments
but
facts
and
attainments
do
says
i
i
have
never
regretted
it
i
am
not
one
says
i
would
cheapen
education
by
making
it
free
tell
me
says
i
is
of
the
most
value
to
mankind
literature
or
horse
racing
er
playing
the
po
i
mean
of
course
the
poets
and
the
great
writers
have
got
the
call
of
course
says
bill
says
i
why
do
the
master
minds
of
finance
and
philanthropy
says
i
us
to
get
into
a
and
let
us
into
a
library
free
is
that
distilling
into
the
masses
says
i
correct
estimate
of
the
relative
value
of
the
two
means
of
and
disorder
are
arguing
outside
of
my
faculties
of
sense
and
rhetoric
says
bill
i
wanted
you
to
do
is
to
go
to
washington
and
dig
out
this
appointment
for
me
i
have
no
ideas
of
cultivation
and
intrigue
i
a
plain
citizen
and
i
need
the
job
i
killed
seven
men
says
bill
got
nine
children
i
been
a
good
republican
ever
since
the
first
of
may
i
ca
read
nor
write
and
i
see
no
reason
why
i
ai
illegible
for
the
office
and
i
think
your
partner
tucker
goes
on
bill
also
a
man
of
sufficient
ingratiation
and
connected
system
of
mental
delinquency
to
assist
you
in
securing
the
appointment
i
will
give
you
preliminary
says
bill
for
drinks
bribes
and
carfare
in
washington
if
you
land
the
job
i
will
pay
you
more
cash
down
and
guarantee
you
impunity
in
whiskey
for
twelve
months
are
you
patriotic
to
the
west
enough
to
help
me
put
this
thing
through
the
whitewashed
wigwam
of
the
great
father
of
the
most
eastern
flag
station
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
says
bill
illustration
i
a
plain
citizen
and
i
need
the
job
well
i
talked
to
andy
about
it
and
he
liked
the
idea
immense
andy
was
a
man
of
an
involved
nature
he
was
never
content
to
plod
along
as
i
was
selling
to
the
peasantry
some
little
tool
like
a
combination
steak
beater
shoe
horn
marcel
waver
monkey
wrench
nail
file
potato
masher
and
multum
in
parvo
tuning
fork
andy
had
the
artistic
temper
which
is
not
to
be
judged
as
a
preacher
or
a
moral
man
is
by
purely
commercial
deflections
so
we
accepted
bill
offer
and
strikes
out
for
washington
says
i
to
andy
when
we
get
located
at
a
hotel
on
south
dakota
avenue
andy
for
the
first
time
in
our
lives
we
got
to
do
a
real
dishonest
act
lobbying
is
something
we
never
been
used
to
but
we
got
to
scandalize
ourselves
for
bill
humble
sake
in
a
straight
and
legitimate
business
says
i
could
afford
to
introduce
a
little
foul
play
and
chicanery
but
in
a
disorderly
and
heinous
piece
of
malpractice
like
this
it
seems
to
me
that
the
straightforward
and
aboveboard
way
is
the
best
i
propose
says
i
we
hand
over
of
this
money
to
the
chairman
of
the
national
campaign
committee
get
a
receipt
lay
the
receipt
on
the
desk
and
tell
him
about
bill
the
president
is
a
man
who
would
appreciate
a
candidate
who
went
about
getting
office
that
way
instead
of
pulling
wires
andy
agreed
with
me
but
after
we
talked
the
scheme
over
with
the
hotel
clerk
we
give
that
plan
up
he
told
us
that
there
was
only
one
way
to
get
an
appointment
in
washington
and
that
was
through
a
lady
lobbyist
he
gave
us
the
address
of
one
he
recommended
a
avery
who
he
said
was
high
up
in
sociable
and
diplomatic
rings
and
circles
the
next
morning
at
me
and
andy
called
at
her
hotel
and
was
shown
up
to
her
reception
room
this
avery
was
a
solace
and
a
balm
to
the
eyesight
she
had
hair
the
color
of
the
back
of
a
twenty
dollar
gold
certificate
blue
eyes
and
a
system
of
beauty
that
would
make
the
girl
on
the
cover
of
a
july
magazine
look
like
a
cook
on
a
monongahela
coal
barge
she
had
on
a
low
necked
dress
covered
with
silver
spangles
and
diamond
rings
and
ear
bobs
her
arms
was
bare
and
she
was
using
a
desk
telephone
with
one
hand
and
drinking
tea
with
the
other
boys
says
she
after
a
bit
is
it
illustration
boys
what
is
it
i
told
her
in
as
few
words
as
possible
what
we
wanted
for
bill
and
the
price
we
could
pay
western
appointments
says
she
easy
see
now
says
she
could
put
that
through
for
us
no
use
fooling
with
the
territorial
delegates
i
guess
says
she
senator
sniper
would
be
about
the
man
he
from
somewheres
in
the
west
let
see
how
he
stands
on
my
private
menu
card
she
takes
some
papers
out
of
a
with
the
letter
over
it
says
she
marked
with
a
star
that
means
ready
to
serve
now
let
see
age
married
twice
presbyterian
likes
blondes
tolstoi
poker
and
stewed
terrapin
sentimental
at
third
bottle
of
wine
yes

goes
on
am
sure
i
can
have
your
friend
bummer
appointed
minister
to
brazil
says
i
united
states

this
sort

me
all
the
memoranda

to
our

i
any
woman
ever
helped
a

but
how
does
it
come
out
say
they

ought
to
be
toady
extraordinary
to
the
court
of
bridget
or
head
porter
of
the
island
of
porto
rico
i
going
to
see
about
it
this
lady
i
says
to
andy
against
the
authorities
at
washington
with
her
baggage
and
munitions
consisting
of
five
dozen
indiscriminating
letters
written
to
her
by
a
member
of
the
cabinet
when
she
was
a
letter
of
introduction
from
king
leopold
to
the
smithsonian
institution
and
a
pink
silk
costume
with
canary
colored
spats
and
then
what
i
goes
has
the
letters
printed
in
the
evening
papers
that
match
her
costume
she
lectures
at
an
informal
tea
given
in
the
palm
room
of
the
b
depot
and
then
calls
on
the
president
the
ninth
assistant
secretary
of
commerce
and
labor
the
first
of
the
blue
room
and
an
unidentified
colored
man
are
waiting
there
to
grasp
her
by
the
hands
and
feet
they
carry
her
out
to
street
and
leave
her
on
a
cellar
door
that
ends
it
the
next
time
we
hear
of
her
she
is
writing
postcards
to
the
chinese
minister
asking
him
to
get
arthur
a
job
in
a
tea
store
says
andy
do
think
avery
will
land
the
marshalship
for
bill
do
not
says
i
do
not
wish
to
be
a
septic
but
i
doubt
if
she
can
do
as
well
as
you
and
me
could
have
done
do
agree
with
you
says
andy
bet
you
she
does
proud
of
having
a
higher
opinion
of
the
talent
and
the
powers
of
negotiation
of
ladies
we
was
back
at
avery
hotel
at
the
time
she
appointed
she
was
looking
pretty
and
fine
enough
as
far
as
that
went
to
make
any
man
let
her
name
every
officer
in
the
country
but
i
had
much
faith
in
looks
so
i
was
certainly
surprised
when
she
pulls
out
a
document
with
the
great
seal
of
the
united
states
on
it
and
henry
in
a
fine
big
hand
on
the
back
might
have
had
it
the
next
day
boys
says
avery
smiling
had
the
slightest
trouble
in
getting
it
says
she
just
asked
for
it
that
all
now
i
like
to
talk
to
you
a
while
she
goes
on
i
awfully
busy
and
i
know
you
excuse
me
i
got
an
ambassadorship
two
consulates
and
a
dozen
other
minor
applications
to
look
after
i
can
hardly
find
time
to
sleep
at
all
you
give
my
compliments
to
humble
when
you
get
home
of
course
well
i
handed
her
the
which
she
pitched
into
her
desk
drawer
without
counting
i
put
bill
appointment
in
my
pocket
and
me
and
andy
made
our
adieus
we
started
back
for
the
territory
the
same
day
we
wired
bill
landed
get
the
tall
glasses
ready
and
we
felt
pretty
good
andy
joshed
me
all
the
way
about
how
little
i
knew
about
women
right
says
i
admit
that
she
surprised
me
but
it
the
first
time
i
ever
knew
one
of
to
manipulate
a
piece
of
business
on
time
without
getting
it
bungled
up
in
some
way
says
i
down
about
the
edge
of
arkansas
i
got
out
bill
appointment
and
looked
it
over
and
then
i
handed
it
to
andy
to
read
andy
read
it
but
did
add
any
remarks
to
my
silence
the
paper
was
for
bill
all
right
and
a
genuine
document
but
it
appointed
him
postmaster
of
dade
city
me
and
andy
got
off
the
train
at
little
rock
and
sent
appointment
to
him
by
mail
then
we
struck
northeast
toward
lake
superior
i
never
saw
bill
humble
after
that
the
exact
science
of
matrimony
as
i
have
told
you
before
said
jeff
peters
i
never
had
much
confidence
in
the
perfidiousness
of
woman
as
partners
or
coeducators
in
the
most
innocent
line
of
graft
they
are
not
trustworthy
they
deserve
the
compliment
said
i
i
think
they
are
entitled
to
be
called
the
honest
sex
why
should
they
be
said
jeff
they
got
the
other
sex
either
grafting
or
working
overtime
for
they
all
right
in
business
until
they
get
their
emotions
or
their
hair
touched
up
too
much
then
you
want
to
have
a
flat
footed
heavy
breathing
man
with
sandy
whiskers
five
kids
and
a
building
and
loan
mortgage
ready
as
an
understudy
to
take
her
desk
now
there
was
that
widow
lady
that
me
and
andy
tucker
engaged
to
help
us
in
that
little
matrimonial
agency
scheme
we
floated
out
in
cairo
when
you
got
enough
advertising
capital
say
a
roll
as
big
as
the
little
end
of
a
wagon
tongue
there
money
in
matrimonial
agencies
we
had
about
and
we
expected
to
double
it
in
two
months
which
is
about
as
long
as
a
scheme
like
ours
can
be
carried
on
without
taking
out
a
new
jersey
charter
we
fixed
up
an
advertisement
that
read
about
like
this
charming
widow
beautiful
home
loving
years
possessing
cash
and
owning
valuable
country
property
would
remarry
would
prefer
a
poor
man
with
affectionate
disposition
to
one
with
means
as
she
realizes
that
the
solid
virtues
are
oftenest
to
be
found
in
the
humble
walks
of
life
no
objection
to
elderly
man
or
one
of
homely
appearance
if
faithful
and
true
and
competent
to
manage
property
and
invest
money
with
judgment
address
with
particulars
lonely
care
of
peters
tucker
agents
cairo
far
so
pernicious
says
i
when
we
had
finished
the
literary
concoction
now
says
i
is
the
lady
andy
gives
me
one
of
his
looks
of
calm
irritation
says
he
thought
you
had
lost
them
ideas
of
realism
in
your
art
why
should
there
be
a
lady
when
they
sell
a
lot
of
watered
stock
on
wall
street
would
you
expect
to
find
a
mermaid
in
it
what
has
a
matrimonial
ad
got
to
do
with
a
lady
listen
says
i
know
my
rule
andy
that
in
all
my
illegitimate
inroads
against
the
legal
letter
of
the
law
the
article
sold
must
be
existent
visible
producible
in
that
way
and
by
a
careful
study
of
city
ordinances
and
train
schedules
i
have
kept
out
of
all
trouble
with
the
police
that
a
five
dollar
bill
and
a
cigar
could
not
square
now
to
work
this
scheme
we
got
to
be
able
to
produce
bodily
a
charming
widow
or
its
equivalent
with
or
without
the
beauty
hereditaments
and
appurtenances
set
forth
in
the
catalogue
and
writ
of
errors
or
hereafter
be
held
by
a
justice
of
the
peace
says
andy
reconstructing
his
mind
it
would
be
safer
in
case
the
post
office
or
the
peace
commission
should
try
to
investigate
our
agency
but
where
he
says
you
hope
to
find
a
widow
who
would
waste
time
on
a
matrimonial
scheme
that
had
no
matrimony
in
it
i
told
andy
that
i
thought
i
knew
of
the
exact
party
an
old
friend
of
mine
zeke
trotter
who
used
to
draw
soda
water
and
teeth
in
a
tent
show
had
made
his
wife
a
widow
a
year
before
by
drinking
some
dyspepsia
cure
of
the
old
doctor
instead
of
the
liniment
that
he
always
got
boozed
up
on
i
used
to
stop
at
their
house
often
and
i
thought
we
could
get
her
to
work
with
us
was
only
sixty
miles
to
the
little
town
where
she
lived
so
i
jumped
out
on
the
and
finds
her
in
the
same
cottage
with
the
same
sunflowers
and
roosters
standing
on
the
washtub
trotter
fitted
our
ad
first
rate
except
maybe
for
beauty
and
age
and
property
valuation
but
she
looked
feasible
and
praiseworthy
to
the
eye
and
it
was
a
kindness
to
zeke
memory
to
give
her
the
job
this
an
honest
deal
you
are
putting
on
peters
she
asks
me
when
i
tell
her
what
we
want
trotter
says
i
tucker
and
me
have
computed
the
calculation
that
men
in
this
broad
and
unfair
country
will
endeavor
to
secure
your
fair
hand
and
ostensible
money
and
property
through
our
advertisement
out
of
that
number
something
like
thirty
hundred
will
expect
to
give
you
in
exchange
if
they
should
win
you
the
carcass
of
a
lazy
and
mercenary
loafer
a
failure
in
life
a
swindler
and
contemptible
fortune
seeker
and
andy
says
i
to
teach
these
preyers
upon
society
a
lesson
it
was
with
difficulty
says
i
me
and
andy
could
refrain
from
forming
a
corporation
under
the
title
of
the
great
moral
and
millennial
malevolent
matrimonial
agency
does
that
satisfy
you
does
peters
says
she
might
have
known
you
have
gone
into
anything
that
was
opprobrious
but
what
will
my
duties
be
do
i
have
to
reject
personally
these
ramscallions
you
speak
of
or
can
i
throw
them
out
in
bunches
job
trotter
says
i
be
practically
a
cynosure
you
will
live
at
a
quiet
hotel
and
will
have
no
work
to
do
andy
and
i
will
attend
to
all
the
correspondence
and
business
end
of
it
course
says
i
of
the
more
ardent
and
impetuous
suitors
who
can
raise
the
railroad
fare
may
come
to
cairo
to
personally
press
their
suit
or
whatever
fraction
of
a
suit
they
may
be
wearing
in
that
case
you
will
be
probably
put
to
the
inconvenience
of
kicking
them
out
face
to
face
we
will
pay
you
per
week
and
hotel
expenses
me
five
minutes
says
trotter
get
my
powder
rag
and
leave
the
front
door
key
with
a
neighbor
and
you
can
let
my
salary
begin
so
i
conveys
trotter
to
cairo
and
establishes
her
in
a
family
hotel
far
enough
away
from
mine
and
andy
quarters
to
be
unsuspicious
and
available
and
i
tell
andy
says
andy
now
that
your
conscience
is
appeased
as
to
the
tangibility
and
proximity
of
the
bait
and
leaving
mutton
aside
suppose
we
revenoo
a
noo
fish
so
we
began
to
insert
our
advertisement
in
newspapers
covering
the
country
far
and
wide
one
ad
was
all
we
used
we
could
have
used
more
without
hiring
so
many
clerks
and
marcelled
paraphernalia
that
the
sound
of
the
gum
chewing
would
have
disturbed
the
we
placed
in
a
bank
to
trotter
credit
and
gave
her
the
book
to
show
in
case
anybody
might
question
the
honesty
and
good
faith
of
the
agency
i
knew
trotter
was
square
and
reliable
and
it
was
safe
to
leave
it
in
her
name
with
that
one
ad
andy
and
me
put
in
twelve
hours
a
day
answering
letters
about
one
hundred
a
day
was
what
came
in
i
never
knew
there
was
so
many
large
hearted
but
indigent
men
in
the
country
who
were
willing
to
acquire
a
charming
widow
and
assume
the
burden
of
investing
her
money
illustration
about
a
day
was
what
came
in
most
of
them
admitted
that
they
ran
principally
to
whiskers
and
lost
jobs
and
were
misunderstood
by
the
world
but
all
of
were
sure
that
they
were
so
chock
full
of
affection
and
manly
qualities
that
the
widow
would
be
making
the
bargain
of
her
life
to
get
every
applicant
got
a
reply
from
peters
tucker
informing
him
that
the
widow
had
been
deeply
impressed
by
his
straightforward
and
interesting
letter
and
requesting
them
to
write
again
stating
more
particulars
and
enclosing
photograph
if
convenient
peters
tucker
also
informed
the
applicant
that
their
fee
for
handing
over
the
second
letter
to
their
fair
client
would
be
enclosed
therewith
there
you
see
the
simple
beauty
of
the
scheme
about
per
cent
of
them
domestic
foreign
noblemen
raised
the
price
somehow
and
sent
it
in
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
except
that
me
and
andy
complained
an
amount
about
being
put
to
the
trouble
of
slicing
open
them
envelopes
and
taking
the
money
out
some
few
clients
called
in
person
we
sent
to
trotter
and
she
did
the
rest
except
for
three
or
four
who
came
back
to
strike
us
for
carfare
after
the
letters
began
to
get
in
from
the
districts
andy
and
me
were
taking
in
about
a
day
one
afternoon
when
we
were
busiest
and
i
was
stuffing
the
two
and
ones
into
cigar
boxes
and
andy
was
whistling
wedding
bells
for
her
a
small
slick
man
drops
in
and
runs
his
eye
over
the
walls
like
he
was
on
the
trail
of
a
lost
gainesborough
painting
or
two
as
soon
as
i
saw
him
i
felt
a
glow
of
pride
because
we
were
running
our
business
on
the
level
see
you
have
quite
a
large
mail
says
the
man
i
reached
and
got
my
hat
on
says
i
been
expecting
you
i
show
you
the
goods
how
was
teddy
when
you
left
washington
i
took
him
down
to
the
riverview
hotel
and
had
him
shake
hands
with
trotter
then
i
showed
him
her
bank
book
with
the
to
her
credit
seems
to
be
all
right
says
the
secret
service
is
says
i
if
you
not
a
married
man
i
leave
you
to
talk
a
while
with
the
lady
we
wo
mention
the
two
dollars
says
he
i
was
i
might
good
day
mrs
peters
toward
the
end
of
three
months
we
had
taken
in
something
over
and
we
saw
it
was
time
to
quit
we
had
a
good
many
complaints
made
to
us
and
trotter
seemed
to
be
tired
of
the
job
a
good
many
suitors
had
been
calling
to
see
her
and
she
did
seem
to
like
that
so
we
decides
to
pull
out
and
i
goes
down
to
trotter
hotel
to
pay
her
last
week
salary
and
say
farewell
and
get
her
check
for
the
when
i
got
there
i
found
her
crying
like
a
kid
that
do
want
to
go
to
school
now
says
i
it
all
about
somebody
sassed
you
or
you
getting
homesick
peters
says
she
tell
you
you
was
always
a
friend
of
zeke
and
i
do
mind
peters
i
in
love
i
just
love
a
man
so
hard
i
ca
bear
not
to
get
him
he
just
the
ideal
always
had
in
mind
illustration
peters
i
in
love
take
him
says
i
is
if
it
a
mutual
case
does
he
return
the
sentiment
according
to
the
specifications
and
painfulness
you
have
described
does
says
she
he
one
of
the
gentlemen
that
been
coming
to
see
me
about
the
advertisement
and
he
wo
marry
me
unless
i
give
him
the
his
name
is
william
wilkinson
and
then
she
goes
off
again
in
the
agitations
and
hysterics
of
romance
trotter
says
i
no
man
more
sympathizing
with
a
woman
affections
than
i
am
besides
you
was
once
the
life
partner
of
one
of
my
best
friends
if
it
was
left
to
me
i
say
take
this
and
the
man
of
your
choice
and
be
happy
could
afford
to
do
that
because
we
have
cleaned
up
over
from
these
suckers
that
wanted
to

a
woman

andy

suspicious

cries

as
she

sorrow
two
days
afterward

andy

better
hurry
and
catch
that
train
i
was
strapping
our
capital
around
me
in
a
memory
belt
like
we
always
carried
it
when
andy
pulls
a
roll
of
large
bills
out
of
his
pocket
and
asks
me
to
put

says
andy
a
midsummer
masquerade
satan
said
jeff
peters
is
a
hard
boss
to
work
for
when
other
people
are
having
their
vacation
is
when
he
keeps
you
the
busiest
as
old
watts
or
paul
or
some
other
diagnostician
says
always
finds
somebody
for
idle
hands
to
do
i
remember
one
summer
when
me
and
my
partner
andy
tucker
tried
to
take
a
layoff
from
our
professional
and
business
duties
but
it
seems
that
our
work
followed
us
wherever
we
went
now
with
a
preacher
it
different
he
can
throw
off
his
responsibilities
and
enjoy
himself
on
the
of
may
he
wraps
mosquito
netting
and
tin
foil
around
the
pulpit
grabs
his
niblick
breviary
and
fishing
pole
and
hikes
for
lake
como
or
atlantic
city
according
to
the
size
of
the
loudness
with
which
he
has
been
called
by
his
congregation
and
sir
for
three
months
he
do
have
to
think
about
business
except
to
hunt
around
in
deuteronomy
and
proverbs
and
timothy
to
find
texts
to
cover
and
exculpate
such
little
midsummer
penances
as
dropping
a
couple
of
looey
door
on
rouge
or
teaching
a
presbyterian
widow
to
swim
but
i
was
going
to
tell
you
about
mine
and
andy
summer
vacation
that
was
one
we
was
tired
of
finance
and
all
the
branches
of
unsanctified
ingenuity
even
andy
whose
brain
rarely
ever
stopped
working
began
to
make
noises
like
a
tennis
cabinet
ho
says
andy
tired
i
got
that
steam
up
the
yacht
corsair
and
ho
for
the
riviera
feeling
i
want
to
loaf
and
indict
my
soul
as
walt
whittier
says
i
want
to
play
pinochle
with
merry
del
val
or
give
a
knouting
to
the
tenants
on
my
tarrytown
estates
or
do
a
monologue
at
a
chautauqua
picnic
in
kilts
or
something
summery
and
outside
the
line
of
routine
and
says
i
have
to
climb
higher
in
the
profession
before
you
can
taste
the
laurels
that
crown
the
footprints
of
the
great
captains
of
industry
now
what
i
like
andy
says
i
be
a
summer
sojourn
in
a
mountain
village
far
from
scenes
of
larceny
labor
and
overcapitalization
i
tired
too
and
a
month
or
so
of
sinlessness
ought
to
leave
us
in
good
shape
to
begin
again
to
take
away
the
white
man
burdens
in
the
fall
andy
fell
in
with
the
rest
cure
at
once
so
we
struck
the
general
passenger
agents
of
all
the
railroads
for
summer
resort
literature
and
took
a
week
to
study
out
where
we
should
go
i
reckon
the
first
passenger
agent
in
the
world
was
that
man
genesis
but
there
much
competition
in
his
day
and
when
he
said
lord
made
the
earth
in
six
days
and
all
very
good
he
had
any
idea
to
what
extent
the
press
agents
of
the
summer
hotels
would
plagiarize
from
him
later
on
when
we
finished
the
booklets
we
perceived
easy
that
the
united
states
from
passadumkeg
maine
to
el
paso
and
from
skagway
to
key
west
was
a
paradise
of
glorious
mountain
peaks
crystal
lakes
new
laid
eggs
golf
girls
garages
cooling
breezes
straw
rides
open
plumbing
and
tennis
and
all
within
two
hours
ride
so
me
and
andy
dumps
the
books
out
the
back
window
and
packs
our
trunk
and
takes
the
tortoise
flyer
for
crow
knob
a
kind
of
a
dernier
resort
in
the
mountains
on
the
line
of
tennessee
and
north
carolina
illustration
dumps
the
books
out
of
the
back
window
we
was
directed
to
a
kind
of
private
hotel
called
woodchuck
inn
and
thither
me
and
andy
bent
and
almost
broke
our
footsteps
over
the
rocks
and
stumps
the
inn
set
back
from
the
road
in
a
big
grove
of
trees
and
it
looked
fine
with
its
broad
porches
and
a
lot
of
women
in
white
dresses
rocking
in
the
shade
the
rest
of
crow
knob
was
a
post
office
and
some
scenery
set
an
angle
of
degrees
and
a
welkin
well
sir
when
we
got
to
the
gate
who
do
you
suppose
comes
down
the
walk
to
greet
us
old
smithers
who
used
to
be
the
best
open
air
painless
dentist
and
electric
liver
pad
faker
in
the
southwest
old
is
dressed
and
has
the
mingled
air
of
a
landlord
and
a
claim
jumper
which
aspect
he
corroborates
by
telling
us
that
he
is
the
host
and
perpetrator
of
woodchuck
inn
i
introduces
andy
and
we
talk
about
a
few
volatile
topics
such
as
will
go
around
at
meetings
of
boards
of
directors
and
old
associates
like
us
three
were
old
leads
us
into
a
kind
of
summer
house
in
the
yard
near
the
gate
and
took
up
the
harp
of
life
and
smote
on
all
the
chords
with
his
mighty
right
says
he
glad
to
see
you
maybe
you
can
help
me
out
of
a
scrape
i
getting
a
bit
old
for
street
work
so
i
leased
this
dogdays
emporium
so
the
good
things
would
come
to
me
two
weeks
before
the
season
opened
i
gets
a
letter
signed
lieut
peary
and
one
from
the
duke
of
marlborough
each
wanting
to
engage
board
for
part
of
the
summer
sir
you
gents
know
what
a
big
thing
for
an
obscure
hustlery
it
would
be
to
have
for
guests
two
gentlemen
whose
names
are
famous
from
long
association
with
icebergs
and
the
coburgs
so
i
prints
a
lot
of
handbills
announcing
that
woodchuck
inn
would
shelter
these
distinguished
boarders
during
the
summer
except
in
places
where
it
leaked
and
i
sends
out
to
towns
around
as
far
as
knoxville
and
charlotte
and
fish
dam
and
bowling
green
now
look
up
there
on
the
porch
gents
says
them
disconsolate
specimens
of
their
fair
sex
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
the
duke
and
the
lieutenant
the
house
is
packed
from
rafters
to
cellar
with
hero
worshippers
four
normal
school
teachers
and
two
abnormal
there
three
high
school
graduates
between
and
there
two
literary
old
maids
and
one
that
can
write
there
a
couple
of
society
women
and
a
lady
from
haw
river
two
elocutionists
are
bunking
in
the
corn
crib
and
i
put
cots
in
the
hay
loft
for
the
cook
and
the
society
editress
of
the
chattanooga
you
see
how
names
draw
gents
says
i
is
it
that
you
seem
to
be
biting
your
thumbs
at
good
luck
you
did
use
to
be
that
way
ai
through
says
was
the
day
for
the
advent
of
the
auspicious
personages
i
goes
down
to
the
depot
to
welcome
two
apparently
animate
substances
gets
off
the
train
both
carrying
bags
full
of
croquet
mallets
and
these
magic
lanterns
with
pushbuttons
i
compares
these
integers
with
the
original
signatures
to
the
letters
and
well
gents
i
reckon
the
mistake
was
due
to
my
poor
eyesight
instead
of
being
the
lieutenant
the
daisy
chain
and
wild
verbena
explorer
was
none
other
than
levi
peevy
a
soda
water
clerk
from
asheville
and
the
duke
of
marlborough
turned
out
to
be
theo
drake
of
murfreesborough
a
bookkeeper
in
a
grocery
what
did
i
do
i
kicked
both
back
on

and
watched
depart
for
the
lowlands

instead
of
the
lieut

the
duke
you
see
the
fix
i
in
gents
goes
on
smithers
told
the
ladies
that
the
notorious
visitors
had
been
detained
on
the
road
by
some
unavoidable
circumstances
that
made
a
noise
like
an
ice
jam
and
an
heiress
but
they
would
arrive
a
day
or
two
later
when
they
find
out
that
they
been
deceived
says
yard
of
cross
barred
muslin
and
natural
waved
switch
in
the
house

pack
up
and
leave
it
a
hard
deal

the
old
man

ye
do
it
gents
he
asks
i
see
that
andy
is
superimposed
with
his
old
hankering
for
the
oral
and
polyglot
system
of
buncoing
that
man
had
a
vocabulary
of
about
words
and
synonyms
which
arrayed
themselves
into
contraband
sophistries
and
parables
when
they
came
out
says
andy
to
old
we
do
it
you
behold
before
you
smithers
two
of
the
finest
equipped
men
on
earth
for
inveigling
the
proletariat
whether
by
word
of
mouth
or
swiftness
of
foot
dukes
come
and
go
explorers
go
and
get
lost
but
me
and
jeff
peters
says
andy
after
the
forever
if
you
say
so
we
the
two
illustrious
guests
you
were
expecting
and
you
find
says
andy
we
give
you
the
true
local
color
of
the
title

from
the
aurora
borealis
to
the
ducal
portcullis
old
is
delighted
he
takes
me
and
andy
up
to
the
inn
by
an
arm
apiece
telling
us
on
the
way
that
the
finest
fruits
of
the
can
and
luxuries
of
the
fast
freights
should
be
ours
without
price
as
long
as
we
would
stay
on
the
porch
says
i
have
the
honor
to
introduce
his
gracefulness
the
duke
of
marlborough
and
the
famous
inventor
of
the
north
pole
lieut
peary
the
skirts
all
flutter
and
the
rocking
chairs
squeak
as
me
and
andy
bows
and
then
goes
on
in
with
old
to
register
and
then
we
washed
up
and
turned
our
cuffs
and
the
landlord
took
us
to
the
rooms
he
been
saving
for
us
and
got
out
a
demijohn
of
north
carolina
real
mountain
dew
i
expected
trouble
when
andy
began
to
drink
he
has
the
artistic
metempsychosis
which
is
half
drunk
when
sober
and
looks
down
on
airships
when
stimulated
after
lingering
with
the
demijohn
me
and
andy
goes
out
on
the
porch
where
the
ladies
are
to
begin
to
earn
our
keep
we
sit
in
two
special
chairs
and
then
the
and
literaterrers
hunched
their
rockers
close
around
us
one
lady
says
to
me
did
that
last
venture
of
yours
turn
out
sir
now
i
clean
forgot
to
have
an
understanding
with
andy
which
i
was
to
be
the
duke
or
the
lieutenant
and
i
could
tell
from
her
question
whether
she
was
referring
to
arctic
or
matrimonial
expeditions
so
i
gave
an
answer
that
would
cover
both
cases
says
i
was
a
freeze
out
right
smart
of
a
freeze
out
and
then
the
flood
gates
of
andy
perorations
was
opened
and
i
knew
which
one
of
the
renowned
ostensible
guests
i
was
supposed
to
be
i
was
either
andy
was
both
and
still
furthermore
it
seemed
that
he
was
trying
to
be
the
mouthpiece
of
the
whole
british
nobility
and
of
arctic
exploration
from
sir
john
franklin
down
it
was
the
union
of
corn
whiskey
and
the
conscientious
fictional
form
that
howletts
admires
so
much
says
andy
smiling
semicircularly
am
truly
glad
to
visit
america
i
do
not
consider
the
magna
charta
says
he
gas
balloons
or
in
any
way
a
detriment
to
the
beauty
and
charm
of
your
american
women
skyscrapers
or
the
architecture
of
your
icebergs
the
next
time
says
andy
i
go
after
the
north
pole
all
the
vanderbilts
in
greenland
wo
be
able
to
turn
me
out
in
the
cold
i
mean
make
it
hot
for
me
us
about
one
of
your
trips
lieutenant
says
one
of
the
normals
says
andy
getting
the
decision
over
a
hiccup
was
in
the
spring
of
last
year
that
i
sailed
the
castle
of
blenheim
up
to
latitude
degrees
fahrenheit
and
beat
the
record
ladies
says
andy
was
a
sad
sight
to
see
a
duke
allied
by
a
civil
and
liturgical
chattel
mortgage
to
one
of
your
first
families
lost
in
a
region
of
semiannual
days
and
then
he
goes
on
four
bells
we
sighted
westminster
abbey
but
there
was
not
a
drop
to
eat
at
noon
we
threw
out
five
sandbags
and
the
ship
rose
fifteen
knots
higher
at
midnight
continues
andy
restaurants
closed
sitting
on
a
cake
of
ice
we
ate
seven
hot
dogs
all
around
us
was
snow
and
ice
six
times
a
night
the
boatswain
rose
up
and
tore
a
leaf
off
the
calendar
so
we
could
keep
time
with
the
barometer
at
says
andy
with
a
lot
of
anguish
on
his
face
huge
polar
bears
sprang
down
the
hatchway
into
the
cabin
and
then
then
lieutenant
says
a
excitedly
andy
gives
a
loud
sob
duchess
shook
me
he
cries
out
and
slides
out
of
the
chair
and
weeps
on
the
porch
well
of
course
that
fixed
the
scheme
the
women
boarders
all
left
the
next
morning
the
landlord
would
speak
to
us
for
two
days
but
when
he
found
we
had
money
to
pay
our
way
he
loosened
up
so
me
and
andy
had
a
quiet
restful
summer
after
all
coming
away
from
crow
knob
with
that
we
enticed
out
of
old
playing
seven
up
shearing
the
wolf
jeff
peters
was
always
eloquent
when
the
ethics
of
his
profession
was
under
discussion
the
only
times
said
he
that
me
and
andy
tucker
ever
had
any
hiatuses
in
our
cordial
intents
was
when
we
differed
on
the
moral
aspects
of
grafting
andy
had
his
standards
and
i
had
mine
i
approve
of
all
of
andy
schemes
for
levying
contributions
from
the
public
and
he
thought
i
allowed
my
conscience
to
interfere
too
often
for
the
financial
good
of
the
firm
we
had
high
arguments
sometimes
one
word
led
on
to
another
till
he
said
i
reminded
him
of
rockefeller
do
know
how
you
mean
that
andy
says
i
we
have
been
friends
too
long
for
me
to
take
offense
at
a
taunt
that
you
will
regret
when
you
cool
off
i
have
yet
says
i
shake
hands
with
a
subpoena
server
one
summer
me
and
andy
decided
to
rest
up
a
spell
in
a
fine
little
town
in
the
mountains
of
kentucky
called
grassdale
we
was
supposed
to
be
horse
drovers
and
good
decent
citizens
besides
taking
a
summer
vacation
the
grassdale
people
liked
us
and
me
and
andy
declared
a
cessation
of
hostilities
never
so
much
as
floating
the
fly
leaf
of
a
rubber
concession
prospectus
or
flashing
a
brazilian
diamond
while
we
was
there
one
day
the
leading
hardware
merchant
of
grassdale
drops
around
to
the
hotel
where
me
and
andy
stopped
and
smokes
with
us
sociable
on
the
side
porch
we
knew
him
pretty
well
from
pitching
quoits
in
the
afternoons
in
the
court
house
yard
he
was
a
loud
red
man
breathing
hard
but
fat
and
respectable
beyond
all
reason

pitching
quoits
in
the
afternoon
in
the
court
house
yard
after
we
talk
on
all
the
notorious
themes
of
the
day
this
murkison
for
such
was
his
entitlements
takes
a
letter
out
of
his
coat
pocket
in
a
careful
careless
way
and
hands
it
to
us
to
read
what
do
you
think
of
that
says
he
laughing
letter
like
that
to
me
me
and
andy
sees
at
a
glance
what
it
is
but
we
pretend
to
read
it
through
it
was
one
of
them
old
time
typewritten
green
goods
letters
explaining
how
for
you
could
get
in
bills
that
an
expert
could
tell
from
the
genuine
and
going
on
to
tell
how
they
were
made
from
plates
stolen
by
an
employee
of
the
treasury
at
washington
of
sending
a
letter
like
that
to
me

murkison
again

sending
a
letter

good
men

says
andy
you
do
answer
the
first
letter
they
let
you
drop
if
you
answer
it
they
write
again
asking
you
to
come
on
with
your
money
and
do
business
think
of
writing
to
me
says
murkison
a
few
days
later
he
drops
around
again
says
he
know
you
are
all
right
or
i
would
confide
in
you
i
wrote
to
them
rascals
again
just
for
fun
they
answered
and
told
me
to
come
on
to
chicago
they
said
telegraph
to
smith
when
i
would
start
when
i
get
there
i
to
wait
on
a
certain
street
corner
till
a
man
in
a
gray
suit
comes
along
and
drops
a
newspaper
in
front
of
me
then
i
am
to
ask
him
how
the
water
is
and
he
knows
it
me
and
i
know
it
him
yes
says
andy
gaping
the
same
old
game
i
often
read
about
it
in
the
papers
then
he
conducts
you
to
the
private
abattoir
in
the
hotel
where
jones
is
already
waiting
they
show
you
brand
new
real
money
and
sell
you
all
you
want
at
five
for
one
you
see
put
it
in
a
satchel
for
you
and
know
it
there
of
course
it
brown
paper
when
you
come
to
look
at
it
afterward
illustration
course
it
brown
paper
they
could
switch
it
on
me
says
murkison
have
built
up
the
best
paying
business
in
grassdale
without
having
witticisms
about
me
you
say
it
real
money
they
show
you
mr
tucker
always
i
see
by
the
papers
that
it
always
is
says
andy
says
murkison
got
it
in
my
mind
that
them
fellows
ca
fool
me
i
think
i
put
a
couple
of
thousand
in
my
jeans
and
go
up
there
and
put
it
all
over
if
bill
murkison
gets
his
eyes
once
on
them
bills
they
show
him
he
never
take
off
of
they
offer
for
and
they
have
to
stick
to
the
bargain
if
i
tackle
that
the
kind
of
trader
bill
murkison
is
yes
i
jist
believe
i
drop
up
chicago
way
and
take
a
to
shot
on
smith
i
guess
the
water
be
fine
enough
me
and
andy
tries
to
get
this
financial
misquotation
out
of
murkison
head
but
we
might
as
well
have
tried
to
keep
the
man
who
rolls
peanuts
with
a
toothpick
from
betting
on
bryan
election
no
sir
he
was
going
to
perform
a
public
duty
by
catching
these
green
goods
swindlers
at
their
own
game
maybe
it
would
teach
a
lesson
after
murkison
left
us
me
and
andy
sat
a
while
prepondering
over
our
silent
meditations
and
heresies
of
reason
in
our
idle
hours
we
always
improved
our
higher
selves
by
ratiocination
and
mental
thought
says
andy
after
a
long
time
unseldom
i
have
seen
fit
to
impugn
your
molars
when
you
have
been
chewing
the
rag
with
me
about
your
conscientious
way
of
doing
business
i
may
have
been
often
wrong
but
here
is
a
case
where
i
think
we
can
agree
i
feel
that
it
would
be
wrong
for
us
to
allow
murkison
to
go
alone
to
meet
those
chicago
green
goods
men
there
is
but
one
way
it
can
end
do
you
think
we
would
both
feel
better
if
we
was
to
intervene
in
some
way
and
prevent
the
doing
of
this
deed
i
got
up
and
shook
andy
tucker
hand
hard
and
long
says
i
may
have
had
one
or
two
hard
thoughts
about
the
heartlessness
of
your
corporation
but
i
retract
now
you
have
a
kind
nucleus
at
the
interior
of
your
exterior
after
all
it
does
you
credit
i
was
just
thinking
the
same
thing
that
you
have
expressed
it
would
not
be
honorable
or
praiseworthy
says
i
us
to
let
murkison
go
on
with
this
project
he
has
taken
up
if
he
is
determined
to
go
let
us
go
with
him
and
prevent
this
swindle
from
coming
off
andy
agreed
with
me
and
i
was
glad
to
see
that
he
was
in
earnest
about
breaking
up
this
green
goods
scheme
do
call
myself
a
religious
man
says
i
a
fanatic
in
moral
bigotry
but
i
ca
stand
still
and
see
a
man
who
has
built
up
his
business
by
his
own
efforts
and
brains
and
risk
be
robbed
by
an
unscrupulous
trickster
who
is
a
menace
to
the
public
good
jeff
says
andy
stick
right
along
with
murkison
if
he
insists
on
going
and
block
this
funny
business
i
hate
to
see
any
money
dropped
in
it
as
bad
as
you
would
well
we
went
to
see
murkison
boys
says
he
ca
consent
to
let
the
song
of
this
chicago
siren
waft
by
me
on
the
summer
breeze
i
fry
some
fat
out
of
this
ignis
fatuus
or
burn
a
hole
in
the
skillet
but
i
be
plumb
diverted
to
death
to
have
you
all
go
along
with
me
maybe
you
could
help
some
when
it
comes
to
cashing
in
the
ticket
to
that
to
shot
yes
really
take
it
as
a
pastime
and
regalement
if
you
boys
would
go
along
too
murkison
gives
it
out
in
grassdale
that
he
is
going
for
a
few
days
with
peters
and
tucker
to
look
over
some
iron
ore
property
in
west
virginia
he
wires
smith
that
he
will
set
foot
in
the
spider
web
on
a
given
date
and
the
three
of
us
lights
out
for
chicago
on
the
way
murkison
amuses
himself
with
premonitions
and
advance
pleasant
recollections
a
gray
suit
says
he
the
southwest
corner
of
wabash
avenue
and
lake
street
he
drops
the
paper
and
i
ask
how
the
water
is
oh
my
my
my
and
then
he
laughs
all
over
for
five
minutes
sometimes
murkison
was
serious
and
tried
to
talk
himself
out
of
his
cogitations
whatever
they
was
says
he
would
have
this
to
get
out
in
grassdale
for
ten
times
a
thousand
dollars
it
would
ruin
me
there
but
i
know
you
all
are
all
right
i
think
it
the
duty
of
every
citizen
says
he
try
to
do
up
these
robbers
that
prey
upon
the
public
i
show
whether
the
water
fine
five
dollars
for
one
that
what
smith
offers
and
he
have
to
keep
his
contract
if
he
does
business
with
bill
murkison
we
got
into
chicago
about
murkison
was
to
meet
the
gray
man
at
half
past
we
had
dinner
at
a
hotel
and
then
went
up
to
room
to
wait
for
the
time
to
come
boys
says
murkison
get
our
gumption
together
and
inoculate
a
plan
for
defeating
the
enemy
suppose
while
i
exchanging
airy
bandage
with
the
gray
capper
you
gents
come
along
by
accident
you
know
and
holler
hello
murk
and
shake
hands
with
symptoms
of
surprise
and
familiarity
then
i
take
the
capper
aside
and
tell
him
you
all
are
jenkins
and
brown
of
grassdale
groceries
and
feed
good
men
and
maybe
willing
to
take
a
chance
while
away
from
home
bring
along
he
say
of
course
if
they
care
to
invest
now
how
does
that
scheme
strike
you
do
you
say
jeff
says
andy
looking
at
me
i
tell
you
what
i
say
says
i
say
let
settle
this
thing
right
here
now
i
do
see
any
use
of
wasting
any
more
time
i
took
a
out
of
my
pocket
and
clicked
the
cylinder
around
a
few
times
undevout
sinful
insidious
hog
says
i
to
murkison
out
that
two
thousand
and
lay
it
on
the
table
obey
with
velocity
says
i
otherwise
alternatives
are
impending
i
am
preferably
a
man
of
mildness
but
now
and
then
i
find
myself
in
the
middle
of
extremities
such
men
as
you
i
went
on
after
he
had
laid
the
money
out
what
keeps
the
jails
and
court
houses
going
you
come
up
here
to
rob
these
men
of
their
money
does
it
excuse
you
i
asks
they
were
trying
to
skin
you
no
sir
you
was
going
to
rob
peter
to
stand
off
paul
you
are
ten
times
worse
says
i
that
green
goods
man
you
go
to
church
at
home
and
pretend
to
be
a
decent
citizen
but
you
come
to
chicago
and
commit
larceny
from
men
that
have
built
up
a
sound
and
profitable
business
by
dealing
with
such
contemptible
scoundrels
as
you
have
tried
to
be
how
do
you
know
says
i
that
green
goods
man
has
a
large
family
dependent
upon
his
extortions
it
you
supposedly
respectable
citizens
who
are
always
on
the
lookout
to
get
something
for
nothing
says
i
support
the
lotteries
and
mines
and
stock
exchanges
and
wire
tappers
of
this
country
if
it
was
for
you
they
go
out
of
business
the
green
goods
man
you
was
going
to
rob
says
i
maybe
for
years
to
learn
his
trade
every
turn
he
makes
he
risks
his
money
and
liberty
and
maybe
his
life
you
come
up
here
all
sanctified
and
vanoplied
with
respectability
and
a
pleasing
post
office
address
to
swindle
him
if
he
gets
the
money
you
can
squeal
to
the
police
if
you
get
it
he
hocks
the
gray
suit
to
buy
supper
and
says
nothing
tucker
and
me
sized
you
up
says
i
came
along
to
see
that
you
got
what
you
deserved
hand
over
the
money
says
i
grass
fed
hypocrite
i
put
the
two
thousand
which
was
all
in
bills
in
my
inside
pocket
get
out
your
watch
says
i
to
murkison
i
do
want
it
says
i
it
on
the
table
and
you
sit
in
that
chair
till
it
ticks
off
an
hour
then
you
can
go
if
you
make
any
noise
or
leave
any
sooner
we
handbill
you
all
over
grassdale
i
guess
your
high
position
there
is
worth
more
than
to
you
then
me
and
andy
left
on
the
train
andy
was
a
long
time
silent
then
he
says
do
you
mind
my
asking
you
a
question
says
i
forty
that
the
idea
you
had
says
he
we
started
out
with
murkison
certainly
says
i
else
could
it
have
been
was
it
yours
too
in
about
half
an
hour
andy
spoke
again
i
think
there
are
times
when
andy
do
exactly
understand
my
system
of
ethics
and
moral
hygiene
says
he
time
when
you
have
the
leisure
i
wish
draw
off
a
diagram
and
of
that
conscience
of
yours
like
to
have
it
to
refer
to
occasionally
innocents
of
broadway
i
hope
some
day
to
retire
from
business
said
jeff
peters
and
when
i
do
i
do
want
anybody
to
be
able
to
say
that
i
ever
got
a
dollar
of
any
man
money
without
giving
him
a
quid
pro
rata
for
it
always
managed
to
leave
a
customer
some
little
gewgaw
to
paste
in
his
scrapbook
or
stick
between
his
seth
thomas
clock
and
the
wall
after
we
are
through
trading
there
was
one
time
i
came
near
having
to
break
this
rule
of
mine
and
do
a
profligate
and
illaudable
action
but
i
was
saved
from
it
by
the
laws
and
statutes
of
our
great
and
profitable
country
one
summer
me
and
andy
tucker
my
partner
went
to
new
york
to
lay
in
our
annual
assortment
of
clothes
and
gents
furnishings
we
was
always
pompous
and
regardless
dressers
finding
that
looks
went
further
than
anything
else
in
our
business
except
maybe
our
knowledge
of
railroad
schedules
and
an
autograph
photo
of
the
president
that
loeb
sent
us
probably
by
mistake
andy
wrote
a
nature
letter
once
and
sent
it
in
about
animals
that
he
had
seen
caught
in
a
trap
lots
of
times
loeb
must
have
read
it
instead
of
lots
and
sent
the
photo
anyhow
it
was
useful
to
us
to
show
people
as
a
guarantee
of
good
faith
me
and
andy
never
cared
much
to
do
business
in
new
york
it
was
too
much
like
pothunting
catching
suckers
in
that
town
is
like
dynamiting
a
texas
lake
for
bass
all
you
have
to
do
anywhere
between
the
north
and
east
rivers
is
to
stand
in
the
street
with
an
open
bag
marked
packages
of
money
here
no
checks
or
loose
bills
taken
you
have
a
cop
handy
to
club
pikers
who
try
to
chip
in
post
office
orders
and
canadian
money
and
that
all
there
is
to
new
york
for
a
hunter
who
loves
his
profession
so
me
and
andy
used
to
just
nature
fake
the
town
we
get
out
our
spyglasses
and
watch
the
woodcocks
along
the
broadway
swamps
putting
plaster
casts
on
their
broken
legs
and
then
we
sneak
away
without
firing
a
shot
one
day
in
the
papier
mâché
palm
room
of
a
chloral
hydrate
and
hops
agency
in
a
side
street
about
eight
inches
off
broadway
me
and
andy
had
thrust
upon
us
the
acquaintance
of
a
new
yorker
we
had
beer
together
until
we
discovered
that
each
of
us
knew
a
man
named
hellsmith
traveling
for
a
stove
factory
in
duluth
this
caused
us
to
remark
that
the
world
was
a
very
small
place
and
then
this
new
yorker
busts
his
string
and
takes
off
his
tin
foil
and
excelsior
packing
and
starts
in
giving
us
his
ellen
terris
beginning
with
the
time
he
used
to
sell
shoelaces
to
the
indians
on
the
spot
where
tammany
hall
now
stands
this
new
yorker
had
made
his
money
keeping
a
cigar
store
in
beekman
street
and
he
had
been
above
fourteenth
street
in
ten
years
moreover
he
had
whiskers
and
the
time
had
gone
by
when
a
true
sport
will
do
anything
to
a
man
with
whiskers
no
grafter
except
a
boy
who
is
soliciting
subscribers
to
an
illustrated
weekly
to
win
the
prize
air
rifle
or
a
widow
would
have
the
heart
to
tamper
with
the
man
behind
with
the
razor
he
was
a
typical
city
reub
i
bet
the
man
had
been
out
of
sight
of
a
skyscraper
in
years
well
presently
this
metropolitan
backwoodsman
pulls
out
a
roll
of
bills
with
an
old
blue
sleeve
elastic
fitting
tight
around
it
and
opens
it
up
peters
says
he
shoving
it
over
the
table
to
me
during
my
fifteen
years
of
business
put
that
in
your
pocket
and
keep
it
for
me
peters
i
glad
to
meet
you
gentlemen
from
the
west
and
i
may
take
a
drop
too
much
i
want
you
to
take
care
of
my
money
for
me
now
let
have
another
beer
illustration
want
you
to
take
care
of
my
money
for
me
better
keep
this
yourself
says
i
are
strangers
to
you
and
you
ca
trust
everybody
you
meet
put
your
roll
back
in
your
pocket
says
i
you
better
run
along
home
before
some
from
the
kaw
river
bottoms
strolls
in
here
and
sells
you
a
copper
mine
i
do
know
says
whiskers
guess
little
old
new
york
can
take
care
of
herself
i
guess
i
know
a
man
that
on
the
square
when
i
see
him
i
always
found
the
western
people
all
right
i
ask
you
as
a
favor
peters
says
he
keep
that
roll
in
your
pocket
for
me
i
know
a
gentleman
when
i
see
him
and
now
let
have
some
more
beer
in
about
ten
minutes
this
fall
of
manna
leans
back
in
his
chair
and
snores
andy
looks
at
me
and
says
reckon
i
better
stay
with
him
for
five
minutes
or
so
in
case
the
waiter
comes
in
i
went
out
the
side
door
and
walked
half
a
block
up
the
street
and
then
i
came
back
and
sat
down
at
the
table
says
i
ca
do
it
it
too
much
like
swearing
off
taxes
i
ca
go
off
with
this
man
money
without
doing
something
to
earn
it
like
taking
advantage
of
the
bankrupt
act
or
leaving
a
bottle
of
eczema
lotion
in
his
pocket
to
make
it
look
more
like
a
square
deal
says
andy
does
seem
kind
of
hard
on
one
professional
pride
to
lope
off
with
a
bearded
pard
competency
especially
after
he
has
nominated
you
custodian
of
his
bundle
in
the
sappy
insouciance
of
his
urban
indiscrimination
suppose
we
wake
him
up
and
see
if
we
can
formulate
some
commercial
sophistry
by
which
he
will
be
enabled
to
give
us
both
his
money
and
a
good
excuse
we
wakes
up
whiskers
he
stretches
himself
and
yawns
out
the
hypothesis
that
he
must
have
dropped
off
for
a
minute
and
then
he
says
he
would
mind
sitting
in
at
a
little
gentleman
game
of
poker
he
used
to
play
some
when
he
attended
high
school
in
brooklyn
and
as
he
was
out
for
a
good
time
why
and
so
forth
andy
brights
up
a
little
at
that
for
it
looks
like
it
might
be
a
solution
to
our
financial
troubles
so
we
all
three
go
to
our
hotel
further
down
broadway
and
have
the
cards
and
chips
brought
up
to
andy
room
i
tried
once
more
to
make
this
babe
in
the
horticultural
gardens
take
his
five
thousand
but
no
that
little
roll
for
me
peters
says
he
oblige
i
ask
you
fer
it
when
i
want
it
i
guess
i
know
when
i
among
friends
a
man
that
done
business
on
beekman
street
for
twenty
years
right
in
the
heart
of
the
wisest
old
village
on
earth
ought
to
know
what
he
about
i
guess
i
can
tell
a
gentleman
from
a
con
man
or
a
flimflammer
when
i
meet
him
i
got
some
odd
change
in
my
clothes
enough
to
start
the
game
with
i
guess
he
goes
through
his
pockets
and
rains
gold
certificates
on
the
table
till
it
looked
like
a
day
in
a
lemon
picture
by
turner
in
the
salons
andy
almost
smiled
the
first
round
that
was
dealt
this
boulevardier
slaps
down
his
hand
claims
low
and
jack
and
big
casino
and
rakes
in
the
pot
andy
always
took
a
pride
in
his
poker
playing
he
got
up
from
the
table
and
looked
sadly
out
of
the
window
at
the
street
cars
gentlemen
says
the
cigar
man
do
blame
you
for
not
wanting
to
play
i
forgotten
the
fine
points
of
the
game
i
guess
it
been
so
long
since
i
indulged
now
how
long
are
you
gentlemen
going
to
be
in
the
city
i
told
him
about
a
week
longer
he
says
that
suit
him
fine
his
cousin
is
coming
over
from
brooklyn
that
evening
and
they
are
going
to
see
the
sights
of
new
york
his
cousin
he
says
is
in
the
artificial
limb
and
lead
casket
business
and
has
crossed
the
bridge
in
eight
years
they
expect
to
have
the
time
of
their
lives
and
he
winds
up
by
asking
me
to
keep
his
roll
of
money
for
him
till
next
day
i
tried
to
make
him
take
it
but
it
only
insulted
him
to
mention
it
use
what
i
got
in
loose
change
says
he
keep
the
rest
for
me
i
drop
in
on
you
and
tucker
afternoon
about
or
says
he
we
have
dinner
together
be
good
after
whiskers
had
gone
andy
looked
at
me
curious
and
doubtful
jeff
says
he
looks
like
the
ravens
are
trying
to
feed
us
two
elijahs
so
hard
that
if
we
turned
down
again
we
ought
to
have
the
audubon
society
after
us
it
wo
do
to
put
the
crown
aside
too
often
i
know
this
is
something
like
paternalism
but
do
you
think
opportunity
has
skinned
its
knuckles
about
enough
knocking
at
our
door
i
put
my
feet
up
on
the
table
and
my
hands
in
my
pockets
which
is
an
attitude
unfavorable
to
frivolous
thoughts
says
i
man
with
the
hirsute
whiskers
has
got
us
in
a
predicament
we
ca
move
hand
or
foot
with
his
money
you
and
me
have
got
a
gentleman
agreement
with
fortune
that
we
ca
break
we
done
business
in
the
west
where
it
more
of
a
fair
game
out
there
the
people
we
skin
are
trying
to
skin
us
even
the
farmers
and
the
remittance
men
that
the
magazines
send
out
to
write
up
goldfields
but
there
little
sport
in
new
york
city
for
rod
reel
or
gun
they
hunt
here
with
either
one
of
two
things
a
slungshot
or
a
letter
of
introduction
the
town
has
been
stocked
so
full
of
carp
that
the
game
fish
are
all
gone
if
you
spread
a
net
here
do
you
catch
legitimate
suckers
in
it
such
as
the
lord
intended
to
be
caught
fresh
guys
who
know
it
all
sports
with
a
little
coin
and
the
nerve
to
play
another
man
game
street
crowds
out
for
the
fun
of
dropping
a
dollar
or
two
and
village
smarties
who
know
just
where
the
little
pea
is
no
sir
says
i
the
grafters
live
on
here
is
widows
and
orphans
and
foreigners
who
save
up
a
bag
of
money
and
hand
it
out
over
the
first
counter
they
see
with
an
iron
railing
to
it
and
factory
girls
and
little
shopkeepers
that
never
leave
the
block
they
do
business
on
that
what
they
call
suckers
here
they
nothing
but
canned
sardines
and
all
the
bait
you
need
to
catch
is
a
pocketknife
and
a
soda
cracker
this
cigar
man
i
went
on
one
of
the
types
he
lived
twenty
years
on
one
street
without
learning
as
much
as
you
would
in
getting
a
shave
from
a
lockjawed
barber
in
a
kansas
crossroads
town
but
he
a
new
yorker
and
he
brag
about
that
all
the
time
when
he
is
picking
up
live
wires
or
getting
in
front
of
street
cars
or
paying
out
money
to
or
standing
under
a
safe
that
being
hoisted
into
a
skyscraper
when
a
new
yorker
does
loosen
up
says
i
like
the
spring
decomposition
of
the
ice
jam
in
the
allegheny
river
he
swamp
you
with
cracked
ice
and
if
you
do
get
out
of
the
way
mighty
lucky
for
us
andy
says
i
this
cigar
exponent
with
the
parsley
dressing
saw
fit
to
bedeck
us
with
his
childlike
trust
and
altruism
for
says
i
money
of
his
is
an
eyesore
to
my
sense
of
rectitude
and
ethics
we
ca
take
it
andy
you
know
we
ca
says
i
we
have
a
shadow
of
a
title
to
it
not
a
shadow
if
there
was
the
least
bit
of
a
way
we
could
put
in
a
claim
to
it
i
be
willing
to
see
him
start
in
for
another
twenty
years
and
make
another
for
himself
but
we
have
sold
him
anything
we
have
been
embroiled
in
a
trade
or
anything
commercial
he
approached
us
friendly
says
i
with
blind
and
beautiful
idiocy
laid
the
stuff
in
our
hands
we
have
to
give
it
back
to
him
when
he
wants
it
illustration
ca
take
it
andy
arguments
says
andy
past
criticism
or
comprehension
no
we
ca
walk
off
with
the
money
as
things
now
stand
i
admire
your
conscious
way
of
doing
business
jeff
says
andy
i
would
propose
anything
that
was
square
in
line
with
your
theories
of
morality
and
initiative
i
be
away
and
most
of
jeff
says
andy
got
some
business
affairs
that
i
want
to
attend
to
when
this
free
greenbacks
party
comes
in
afternoon
hold
him
here
till
i
arrive
we
all
got
an
engagement
for
dinner
you
know
well
sir
about
the
next
afternoon
in
trips
the
cigar
man
with
his
eyes
half
open
having
a
glorious
time
peters
says
he
in
all
the
sights
i
tell
you
new
york
is
the
onliest
only
now
if
you
mind
says
he
lie
down
on
that
couch
and
doze
off
for
about
nine
minutes
before
tucker
comes
i
not
used
to
being
up
all
night
and
if
you
do
mind
peters
i
take
that
five
thousand
i
met
a
man
last
night
that
got
a
sure
winner
at
the
racetrack
excuse
me
for
being
so
impolite
as
to
go
to
sleep
mr
peters
and
so
this
inhabitant
of
the
second
city
in
the
world
reposes
himself
and
begins
to
snore
while
i
sit
there
musing
over
things
and
wishing
i
was
back
in
the
west
where
you
could
always
depend
on
a
customer
fighting
to
keep
his
money
hard
enough
to
let
your
conscience
take
it
from
him
at
andy
comes
in
and
sees
the
sleeping
form
been
over
to
trenton
says
andy
pulling
a
document
out
of
his
pocket
think
i
got
this
matter
fixed
up
all
right
jeff
look
at
that
i
open
the
paper
and
see
that
it
is
a
corporation
charter
issued
by
the
state
of
new
jersey
to
peters
tucker
consolidated
and
amalgamated
aerial
franchise
development
company
limited
to
buy
up
rights
of
way
for
airship
lines
explained
andy
legislature
was
in
session
but
i
found
a
man
at
a
postcard
stand
in
the
lobby
that
kept
a
stock
of
charters
on
hand
there
are
shares
says
andy
to
reach
a
par
value
of
i
had
one
blank
certificate
of
stock
printed
andy
takes
out
the
blank
and
begins
to
fill
it
in
with
a
fountain
pen
whole
bunch
says
he
to
our
friend
in
dreamland
for
did
you
learn
his
name
it
out
to
bearer
says
i
we
put
the
certificate
of
stock
in
the
cigar
man
hand
and
went
out
to
pack
our
suit
cases
illustration
we
put
the
certificate
of
stock
in
the
hand
on
the
ferryboat
andy
says
to
me
your
conscience
easy
about
taking
the
money
now
jeff
should
it
be
says
i
we
any
better
than
any
other
holding
corporation
conscience
in
art
i
never
could
hold
my
partner
andy
tucker
down
to
legitimate
ethics
of
pure
swindling
said
jeff
peters
to
me
one
day
andy
had
too
much
imagination
to
be
honest
he
used
to
devise
schemes
of
so
fraudulent
and
that
they
have
been
allowed
in
the
bylaws
of
a
railroad
rebate
system
myself
i
never
believed
in
taking
any
man
dollars
unless
i
gave
him
something
for
it
something
in
the
way
of
rolled
gold
jewelry
garden
seeds
lumbago
lotion
stock
certificates
stove
polish
or
a
crack
on
the
head
to
show
for
his
money
i
guess
i
must
have
had
new
england
ancestors
away
back
and
inherited
some
of
their
stanch
and
rugged
fear
of
the
police
but
andy
family
tree
was
in
different
kind
i
do
think
he
could
have
traced
his
descent
any
further
back
than
a
corporation
one
summer
while
we
was
in
the
middle
west
working
down
the
ohio
valley
with
a
line
of
family
albums
headache
powders
and
roach
destroyer
andy
takes
one
of
his
notions
of
high
and
actionable
financiering
says
he
been
thinking
that
we
ought
to
drop
these
rutabaga
fanciers
and
give
our
attention
to
something
more
nourishing
and
prolific
if
we
keep
on
snapshooting
these
hinds
for
their
egg
money
we
be
classed
as
nature
fakers
how
about
plunging
into
the
fastnesses
of
the
skyscraper
country
and
biting
some
big
bull
caribous
in
the
chest
says
i
know
my
idiosyncrasies
i
prefer
a
square
style
of
business
such
as
we
are
carrying
on
now
when
i
take
money
i
want
to
leave
some
tangible
object
in
the
other
hands
for
him
to
gaze
at
and
to
distract
his
attention
from
my
spoor
even
if
it
only
a
komical
kuss
trick
finger
ring
for
squirting
perfume
in
a
friend
eye
but
if
you
got
a
fresh
idea
andy
says
i
have
a
look
at
it
i
not
so
wedded
to
petty
graft
that
i
would
refuse
something
better
in
the
way
of
a
subsidy
was
thinking
says
andy
a
little
hunt
without
horn
hound
or
camera
among
the
great
herd
of
the
midas
americanus
commonly
known
as
the
pittsburg
millionaires
new
york
i
asks
sir
says
andy
pittsburg
that
their
habitat
they
like
new
york
they
go
there
now
and
then
just
because
it
expected
of
pittsburg
millionaire
in
new
york
is
like
a
fly
in
a
cup
of
hot
coffee
he
attracts
attention
and
comment
but
he
do
enjoy
it
new
york
ridicules
him
for
blowing
so
much
money
in
that
town
of
sneaks
and
snobs
and
sneers
the
truth
is
he
do
spend
anything
while
he
is
there
i
saw
a
memorandum
of
expenses
for
a
ten
days
trip
to
bunkum
town
made
by
a
pittsburg
man
worth
once
here
the
way
he
set
it
down
fare
to
and
from
cab
fare
to
and
from
hotel
hotel
bill
per
day
tips
total
the
voice
of
new
york
goes
on
andy
town
nothing
but
a
head
waiter
if
you
tip
it
too
much
it
go
and
stand
by
the
door
and
make
fun
of
you
to
the
hat
check
boy
when
a
pittsburger
wants
to
spend
money
and
have
a
good
time
he
stays
at
home
that
where
go
to
catch
him
well
to
make
a
dense
story
more
condensed
me
and
andy
cached
our
paris
green
and
antipyrine
powders
and
albums
in
a
friend
cellar
and
took
the
trail
to
pittsburg
andy
did
have
any
especial
prospectus
of
chicanery
and
violence
drawn
up
but
he
always
had
plenty
of
confidence
that
his
immoral
nature
would
rise
to
any
occasion
that
presented
itself
as
a
concession
to
my
ideas
of
and
rectitude
he
promised
that
if
i
should
take
an
active
and
incriminating
part
in
any
little
business
venture
that
we
might
work
up
there
should
be
something
actual
and
cognizant
to
the
senses
of
touch
sight
taste
or
smell
to
transfer
to
the
victim
for
the
money
so
my
conscience
might
rest
easy
after
that
i
felt
better
and
entered
more
cheerfully
into
the
foul
play
says
i
as
we
strayed
through
the
smoke
along
the
cinderpath
they
call
smithfield
street
you
figured
out
how
we
are
going
to
get
acquainted
with
these
coke
kings
and
pig
iron
squeezers
not
that
i
would
decry
my
own
worth
or
system
of
drawing
room
deportment
and
work
with
the
olive
fork
and
pie
knife
says
i
is
the
entree
nous
into
the
salons
of
the
stogie
smokers
going
to
be
harder
than
you
imagined
there
any
handicap
at
all
says
andy
our
own
refinement
and
inherent
culture
pittsburg
millionaires
are
a
fine
body
of
plain
wholehearted
unassuming
democratic
men
are
rough
but
uncivil
in
their
manners
and
though
their
ways
are
boisterous
and
unpolished
under
it
all
they
have
a
great
deal
of
impoliteness
and
discourtesy
nearly
every
one
of
rose
from
obscurity
says
andy
they
live
in
it
till
the
town
gets
to
using
smoke
consumers
if
we
act
simple
and
unaffected
and
do
go
too
far
from
the
saloons
and
keep
making
a
noise
like
an
import
duty
on
steel
rails
we
wo
have
any
trouble
in
meeting
some
of
socially
well
andy
and
me
drifted
about
town
three
or
four
days
getting
our
bearings
we
got
to
knowing
several
millionaires
by
sight
one
used
to
stop
his
automobile
in
front
of
our
hotel
and
have
a
quart
of
champagne
brought
out
to
him
when
the
waiter
opened
it
turn
it
up
to
his
mouth
and
drink
it
out
of
the
bottle
that
showed
he
used
to
be
a
glassblower
before
he
made
his
money
one
evening
andy
failed
to
come
to
the
hotel
for
dinner
about
he
came
into
my
room
one
jeff
says
he
millions
oil
rolling
mills
real
estate
and
natural
gas
he
a
fine
man
no
airs
about
him
made
all
his
money
in
the
last
five
years
he
got
professors
posting
him
up
now
in
education
art
and
literature
and
haberdashery
and
such
things
i
saw
him
he
just
won
a
bet
of
with
a
steel
corporation
man
that
there
be
four
suicides
in
the
allegheny
rolling
mills
so
everybody
in
sight
had
to
walk
up
and
have
drinks
on
him
he
took
a
fancy
to
me
and
asked
me
to
dinner
with
him
we
went
to
a
restaurant
in
diamond
alley
and
sat
on
stools
and
had
a
sparkling
moselle
and
clam
chowder
and
apple
fritters
he
wanted
to
show
me
his
bachelor
apartment
on
liberty
street
he
got
ten
rooms
over
a
fish
market
with
privilege
of
the
bath
on
the
next
floor
above
he
told
me
it
cost
him
to
furnish
his
apartment
and
i
believe
it
got
worth
of
pictures
in
one
room
and
worth
of
curios
and
antiques
in
another
his
name
scudder
and
he
and
taking
lessons
on
the
piano
and
barrels
of
oil
a
day
out
of
his
wells
right
says
i
canter
satisfactory
but
kay
vooly
voo
what
good
is
the
art
junk
to
us
and
the
oil
that
man
says
andy
sitting
thoughtfully
on
the
bed
what
you
would
call
an
ordinary
scutt
when
he
was
showing
me
his
cabinet
of
art
curios
his
face
lighted
up
like
the
door
of
a
coke
oven
he
says
that
if
some
of
his
big
deals
go
through
he
make
morgan
collection
of
sweatshop
tapestry
and
augusta
beadwork
look
like
the
contents
of
an
ostrich
craw
thrown
on
a
screen
by
a
magic
lantern
then
he
showed
me
a
little
carving
went
on
andy
anybody
could
see
was
a
wonderful
thing
it
was
something
like
years
old
he
said
it
was
a
lotus
flower
with
a
woman
face
in
it
carved
out
of
a
solid
piece
of
ivory
scudder
looks
it
up
in
a
catalogue
and
describes
it
an
egyptian
carver
named
khafra
made
two
of
for
king
rameses
ii
about
the
year
the
other
one
ca
be
found
the
junkshops
and
antique
bugs
have
rubbered
all
europe
for
it
but
it
seems
to
be
out
of
stock
scudder
paid
for
the
one
he
has
well
says
i
sounds
like
the
purling
of
a
rill
to
me
i
thought
we
came
here
to
teach
the
millionaires
business
instead
of
learning
art
from
patient
says
andy
kindly
we
will
see
a
rift
in
the
smoke
ere
long
all
the
next
morning
andy
was
out
i
did
see
him
until
about
noon
he
came
to
the
hotel
and
called
me
into
his
room
across
the
hall
he
pulled
a
roundish
bundle
about
as
big
as
a
goose
egg
out
of
his
pocket
and
unwrapped
it
it
was
an
ivory
carving
just
as
he
had
described
the
millionaire
to
me
went
in
an
old
second
hand
store
and
pawnshop
a
while
ago
says
andy
i
see
this
half
hidden
under
a
lot
of
old
daggers
and
truck
the
pawnbroker
said
he
had
it
several
years
and
thinks
it
was
soaked
by
some
arabs
or
turks
or
some
foreign
dubs
that
used
to
live
down
by
the
river
offered
him
for
it
and
i
must
have
looked
like
i
wanted
it
for
he
said
it
would
be
taking
the
pumpernickel
out
of
his
mouths
to
hold
any
conversation
that
did
not
lead
up
to
a
price
of
i
finally
got
it
for
goes
on
andy
is
the
exact
counterpart
of
carving
it
absolutely
a
dead
ringer
for
it
he
pay
for
it
as
quick
as
he
tuck
a
napkin
under
his
chin
and
why
should
it
be
the
genuine
other
one
anyhow
that
the
old
gypsy
whittled
out
not
indeed
says
i
how
shall
we
go
about
compelling
him
to
make
a
voluntary
purchase
of
it
andy
had
his
plan
all
ready
and
i
tell
you
how
we
carried
it
out
i
got
a
pair
of
blue
spectacles
put
on
my
black
frock
coat
rumpled
my
hair
up
and
became
pickleman
i
went
to
another
hotel
registered
and
sent
a
telegram
to
scudder
to
come
to
see
me
at
once
on
important
art
business
the
elevator
dumped
him
on
me
in
less
than
an
hour
he
was
a
foggy
man
with
a
clarion
voice
smelling
of
connecticut
wrappers
and
naphtha
profess
he
shouts
your
conduct
i
rumpled
my
hair
some
more
and
gave
him

pittsburg
pennsylvania

harmful
and
deleterious
amusements

have
come
from

antiquity
and
i

back
to
andy
hotel
according
to
arrangement
andy
is
walking
up
and
down
the
room
looking
at
his
watch
he
says

just
eleven
minutes
says
andy
catch
the
b
westbound
grab
your
baggage
the
hurry
says
i
was
a
square
deal
and
even
if
it
was
only
an
imitation
of
the
original
carving
it
take
him
some
time
to
find
it
out
he
seemed
to
be
sure
it
was
the
genuine
article
was
says
andy
was
his
own
when
i
was
looking
at
his
curios
yesterday
he
stepped
out
of
the
room
for
a
moment
and
i
pocketed
it
now
will
you
pick
up
your
suit
case
and
hurry
says
i
was
that
story
about
finding
another
one
in
the
pawn
says
andy
of
respect
for
that
conscience
of
yours
come
on
the
man
higher
up
across
our
two
dishes
of
spaghetti
in
a
corner
of
restaurant
jeff
peters
was
explaining
to
me
the
three
kinds
of
graft
every
winter
jeff
comes
to
new
york
to
eat
spaghetti
to
watch
the
shipping
in
east
river
from
the
depths
of
his
chinchilla
overcoat
and
to
lay
in
a
supply
of
clothing
at
one
of
the
fulton
street
stores
during
the
other
three
seasons
he
may
be
found
further
west
his
range
is
from
spokane
to
tampa
in
his
profession
he
takes
a
pride
which
he
supports
and
defends
with
a
serious
and
unique
philosophy
of
ethics
his
profession
is
no
new
one
he
is
an
incorporated
uncapitalized
unlimited
asylum
for
the
reception
of
the
restless
and
unwise
dollars
of
his
fellowmen
in
the
wilderness
of
stone
in
which
jeff
seeks
his
annual
lonely
holiday
he
is
glad
to
palaver
of
his
many
adventures
as
a
boy
will
whistle
after
sundown
in
a
wood
wherefore
i
mark
on
my
calendar
the
time
of
his
coming
and
open
a
question
of
privilege
at
concerning
the
little
table
in
the
corner
between
the
rakish
rubber
plant
and
the
framed
palazzio
della
something
on
the
wall
there
are
two
kinds
of
graft
said
jeff
that
ought
to
be
wiped
out
by
law
i
mean
wall
street
speculation
and
burglary
nearly
everybody
will
agree
with
you
as
to
one
of
them
said
i
with
a
laugh
well
burglary
ought
to
be
wiped
out
too
said
jeff
and
i
wondered
whether
the
laugh
had
been
redundant
about
three
months
ago
said
jeff
it
was
my
privilege
to
become
familiar
with
a
sample
of
each
of
the
aforesaid
branches
of
illegitimate
art
i
was
qua
with
a
member
of
the
housebreakers
union
and
one
of
the
john
napoleons
of
finance
at
the
same
time
interesting
combination
said
i
with
a
yawn
did
i
tell
you
i
bagged
a
duck
and
a
at
one
shot
last
week
over
in
the
ramapos
i
knew
well
how
to
draw
jeff
stories
let
me
tell
you
first
about
these
barnacles
that
clog
the
wheels
of
society
by
poisoning
the
springs
of
rectitude
with
their
eye
said
jeff
with
the
pure
gleam
of
the
in
his
own
as
i
said
three
months
ago
i
got
into
bad
company
there
are
two
times
in
a
man
life
when
he
does
this
when
he
dead
broke
and
when
he
rich
now
and
then
the
most
legitimate
business
runs
out
of
luck
it
was
out
in
arkansas
i
made
the
wrong
turn
at
a
and
drives
into
this
town
of
peavine
by
mistake
it
seems
i
had
already
assaulted
and
disfigured
peavine
the
spring
of
the
year
before
i
had
sold
worth
of
young
fruit
trees
there
plums
cherries
peaches
and
pears
the
peaviners
were
keeping
an
eye
on
the
country
road
and
hoping
i
might
pass
that
way
again
i
drove
down
main
street
as
far
as
the
crystal
palace
drugstore
before
i
realized
i
had
committed
ambush
upon
myself
and
my
white
horse
bill
the
peaviners
took
me
by
surprise
and
bill
by
the
bridle
and
began
a
conversation
that
was
entirely
disassociated
with
the
subject
of
fruit
trees
a
committee
of
ran
some
through
the
armholes
of
my
vest
and
escorted
me
through
their
gardens
and
orchards
their
fruit
trees
had
lived
up
to
their
labels
most
of
had
turned
out
to
be
persimmons
and
dogwoods
with
a
grove
or
two
of
blackjacks
and
poplars
the
only
one
that
showed
any
signs
of
bearing
anything
was
a
fine
young
cottonwood
that
had
put
forth
a
nest
and
half
of
an
old
the
peaviners
protracted
our
fruitless
stroll
to
the
edge
of
town
they
took
my
watch
and
money
on
account
and
they
kept
bill
and
the
wagon
as
hostages
they
said
the
first
time
one
of
them
dogwood
trees
put
forth
an
amsden
june
peach
i
might
come
back
and
get
my
things
then
they
took
off
the
trace
chains
and
jerked
their
thumbs
in
the
direction
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
i
struck
a
lewis
and
clark
lope
for
the
swollen
rivers
and
impenetrable
forests
when
i
regained
intellectualness
i
found
myself
walking
into
an
unidentified
town
on
the
railroad
the
peaviners
left
anything
in
my
pockets
except
a
plug
of
chewing
they
after
my
life
and
that
saved
it
i
bit
off
a
chunk
and
sits
down
on
a
pile
of
ties
by
the
track
to
recogitate
my
sensations
of
thought
and
perspicacity
and
then
along
comes
a
fast
freight
which
slows
up
a
little
at
the
town
and
off
of
it
drops
a
black
bundle
that
rolls
for
twenty
yards
in
a
cloud
of
dust
and
then
gets
up
and
begins
to
spit
soft
coal
and
interjections
i
see
it
is
a
young
man
broad
across
the
face
dressed
more
for
pullmans
than
freights
and
with
a
cheerful
kind
of
smile
in
spite
of
it
all
that
made
phoebe
snow
job
look
like
a
off
says
i
says
he
off
arrived
at
my
destination
what
town
is
this
looked
it
up
on
the
map
yet
says
i
got
in
about
five
minutes
before
you
did
how
does
it
strike
you
says
he
twisting
one
of
his
arms
around
believe
that
shoulder
no
it
all
right
he
stoops
over
to
brush
the
dust
off
his
clothes
when
out
of
his
pocket
drops
a
fine
burglar
steel
jimmy
he
picks
it
up
and
looks
at
me
sharp
and
then
grins
and
holds
out
his
hand
says
he
did
i
see
you
in
southern
missouri
last
summer
selling
colored
sand
at
a
teaspoonful
to
put
into
lamps
to
keep
the
oil
from
exploding
says
i
explodes
it
the
gas
that
forms
that
explodes
but
i
shakes
hands
with
him
anyway
name
bill
bassett
says
he
to
me
if
you
call
it
professional
pride
instead
of
conceit
i
inform
you
that
you
have
the
pleasure
of
meeting
the
best
burglar
that
ever
set
a
on
ground
drained
by
the
mississippi
river
well
me
and
this
bill
bassett
sits
on
the
ties
and
exchanges
brags
as
artists
in
kindred
lines
will
do
it
seems
he
did
have
a
cent
either
and
we
went
into
close
caucus
he
explained
why
an
able
burglar
sometimes
had
to
travel
on
freights
by
telling
me
that
a
servant
girl
had
played
him
false
in
little
rock
and
he
was
making
a
quick
part
of
my
business
says
bill
bassett
play
up
to
the
ruffles
when
i
want
to
make
a
riffle
as
raffles
is
loves
that
makes
the
bit
go
show
me
a
house
with
a
swag
in
it
and
a
pretty
and
you
might
as
well
call
the
silver
melted
down
and
sold
and
me
spilling
truffles
and
that
chateau
stuff
on
the
napkin
under
my
chin
while
the
police
are
calling
it
an
inside
job
just
because
the
old
lady
nephew
teaches
a
bible
class
i
first
make
an
impression
on
the
girl
says
bill
when
she
lets
me
inside
i
make
an
impression
on
the
locks
but
this
one
in
little
rock
done
me
says
he
saw
me
taking
a
trolley
ride
with
another
girl
and
when
i
came
on
the
night
she
was
to
leave
the
door
open
for
me
it
was
fast
and
i
had
keys
made
for
the
doors
upstairs
but
no
sir
she
had
sure
cut
off
my
locks
she
was
a
delilah
says
bill
bassett
it
seems
that
bill
tried
to
break
in
anyhow
with
his
jimmy
but
the
girl
emitted
a
succession
of
bravura
noises
like
the
of
a
and
bill
had
to
take
all
the
hurdles
between
there
and
the
depot
as
he
had
no
baggage
they
tried
hard
to
check
his
departure
but
he
made
a
train
that
was
just
pulling
out
says
bill
bassett
when
we
had
exchanged
memories
of
our
dead
lives
could
eat
this
town
do
look
like
it
was
kept
under
a
yale
lock
suppose
we
commit
some
mild
atrocity
that
will
bring
in
temporary
expense
money
i
do
suppose
you
brought
along
any
hair
tonic
or
rolled
gold
or
similar
swindles
that
you
could
sell
on
the
plaza
to
the
pikers
of
the
paretic
populace
have
you
says
i
left
an
elegant
line
of
patagonian
diamond
earrings
and
sunbursts
in
my
valise
at
peavine
but
they
to
stay
there
until
some
of
those
trees
begin
to
glut
the
market
with
yellow
clings
and
japanese
plums
i
reckon
we
ca
count
on
them
unless
we
take
luther
burbank
in
for
a
partner
well
says
bassett
do
the
best
we
can
maybe
after
dark
i
borrow
a
hairpin
from
some
lady
and
open
the
farmers
and
drovers
marine
bank
with
it
while
we
were
talking
up
pulls
a
passenger
train
to
the
depot
near
by
a
person
in
a
high
hat
gets
off
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
train
and
comes
tripping
down
the
track
towards
us
he
was
a
little
fat
man
with
a
big
nose
and
rat
eyes
but
dressed
expensive
and
carrying
a
careful
as
if
it
had
eggs
or
railroads
bonds
in
it
he
passes
by
us
and
keeps
on
down
the
track
not
appearing
to
notice
the
town
on
says
bill
bassett
to
me
starting
after
him
i
asks
says
bill
you
forgot
you
was
in
the
desert
did
you
see
colonel
manna
drop
down
right
before
your
eyes
do
you
hear
the
rustling
of
general
raven
wings
i
surprised
at
you
elijah
we
overtook
the
stranger
in
the
edge
of
some
woods
and
as
it
was
after
and
in
a
quiet
place
nobody
saw
us
stop
him
bill
takes
the
silk
hat
off
the
man
head
and
brushes
it
with
his
sleeve
and
puts
it
back
does
this
mean
sir
says
the
man
i
wore
one
of
these
says
bill
felt
embarrassed
i
always
done
that
not
having
one
now
i
had
to
use
yours
i
hardly
know
how
to
begin
sir
in
explaining
our
business
with
you
but
i
guess
we
try
your
pockets
first
bill
bassett
felt
in
all
of
them
and
looked
disgusted
even
a
watch
he
says
you
ashamed
of
yourself
you
whited
sculpture
going
about
dressed
like
a
and
financed
like
a
count
you
have
even
got
carfare
what
did
you
do
with
your
transfer
the
man
speaks
up
and
says
he
has
no
assets
or
valuables
of
any
sort
but
bassett
takes
his
and
opens
it
out
comes
some
collars
and
socks
and
a
half
a
page
of
a
newspaper
clipped
out
bill
reads
the
clipping
careful
and
holds
out
his
hand
to
the
party
says
he
accept
the
apologies
of
friends
i
am
bill
bassett
the
burglar
peters
you
must
make
the
acquaintance
of
alfred
ricks
shake
hands
peters
says
bill
about
halfway
between
me
and
you
ricks
in
the
line
of
havoc
and
corruption
he
always
gives
something
for
the
money
he
gets
i
glad
to
meet
you
ricks
you
and
peters
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
attended
a
full
gathering
of
the
national
synod
of
sharks
housebreaking
swindling
and
financiering
all
represented
please
examine
rick
credentials
mr
peters
the
piece
of
newspaper
that
bill
bassett
handed
me
had
a
good
picture
of
this
ricks
on
it
it
was
a
chicago
paper
and
it
had
obloquies
of
ricks
in
every
paragraph
by
reading
it
over
i
harvested
the
intelligence
that
said
alleged
ricks
had
laid
off
all
that
portion
of
the
state
of
florida
that
lies
under
water
into
town
lots
and
sold
to
alleged
innocent
investors
from
his
magnificently
furnished
offices
in
chicago
after
he
had
taken
in
a
hundred
thousand
or
so
dollars
one
of
these
fussy
purchasers
that
are
always
making
trouble
i
had
actually
try
gold
watches
i
sold
with
acid
took
a
cheap
excursion
down
to
the
land
where
it
is
always
just
before
supper
to
look
at
his
lot
and
see
if
it
did
need
a
new
paling
or
two
on
the
fence
and
market
a
few
lemons
in
time
for
the
christmas
present
trade
he
hires
a
surveyor
to
find
his
lot
for
him
they
run
the
line
out
and
find
the
flourishing
town
of
paradise
hollow
so
advertised
to
be
about
rods
and
poles
degrees
of
the
middle
of
lake
okeechobee
this
man
lot
was
under
feet
of
water
and
besides
had
been
preempted
so
long
by
the
alligators
and
gars
that
his
title
looked
fishy
naturally
the
man
goes
back
to
chicago
and
makes
it
as
hot
for
alfred
ricks
as
the
morning
after
a
prediction
of
snow
by
the
weather
bureau
ricks
defied
the
allegation
but
he
could
deny
the
alligators
one
morning
the
papers
came
out
with
a
column
about
it
and
ricks
come
out
by
the
it
seems
the
alleged
authorities
had
beat
him
to
the
box
where
he
kept
his
winnings
and
ricks
has
to
westward
ho
with
only
feetwear
and
a
dozen
english
pokes
in
his
shopping
bag
he
happened
to
have
some
mileage
left
in
his
book
and
that
took
him
as
far
as
the
town
in
the
wilderness
where
he
was
spilled
out
on
me
and
bill
bassett
as
elijah
iii
with
not
a
raven
in
sight
for
any
of
us
then
this
alfred
ricks
lets
out
a
squeak
that
he
is
hungry
too
and
denies
the
hypothesis
that
he
is
good
for
the
value
let
alone
the
price
of
a
meal
and
so
there
was
the
three
of
us
representing
if
we
had
a
mind
to
draw
syllogisms
and
parabolas
labor
and
trade
and
capital
now
when
trade
has
no
capital
there
is
a
dicker
to
be
made
and
when
capital
has
no
money
there
a
stagnation
in
steak
and
onions
that
put
it
up
to
the
man
with
the
jimmy
bushrangers
says
bill
bassett
yet
in
trouble
did
i
desert
a
pal
hard
by
in
yon
wood
i
seem
to
see
unfurnished
lodgings
let
us
go
there
and
wait
till
dark
there
was
an
old
deserted
cabin
in
the
grove
and
we
three
took
possession
of
it
after
dark
bill
bassett
tells
us
to
wait
and
goes
out
for
half
an
hour
he
comes
back
with
a
armful
of
bread
and
spareribs
and
pies
at
a
farmhouse
on
washita
avenue
says
he
drink
and
be
leary
the
full
moon
was
coming
up
bright
so
we
sat
on
the
floor
of
the
cabin
and
ate
in
the
light
of
it
and
this
bill
bassett
begins
to
brag
says
he
with
his
mouth
full
of
country
produce
lose
all
patience
with
you
people
that
think
you
are
higher
up
in
the
profession
than
i
am
now
what
could
either
of
you
have
done
in
the
present
emergency
to
set
us
on
our
feet
again
could
you
do
it
ricksy
must
confess
bassett
says
ricks
speaking
nearly
inaudible
out
of
a
slice
of
pie
at
this
immediate
juncture
i
could
not
perhaps
promote
an
enterprise
to
relieve
the
situation
large
operations
such
as
i
direct
naturally
require
careful
preparation
in
advance
i
know
ricksy
breaks
in
bill
bassett
need
finish
you
need
to
make
the
first
payment
on
a
blond
typewriter
and
four
roomsful
of
quartered
oak
furniture
and
you
need
more
for
advertising
contracts
and
you
need
two
weeks
time
for
the
fish
to
begin
to
bite
your
line
of
relief
would
be
about
as
useful
in
an
emergency
as
advocating
municipal
ownership
to
cure
a
man
suffocated
by
gas
and
your
graft
ai
much
swifter
brother
peters
he
winds
up
says
i
have
seen
you
turn
anything
into
gold
with
your
wand
yet
good
fairy
anybody
could
rub
the
magic
ring
for
a
little
victuals
was
only
getting
the
pumpkin
ready
says
bassett
braggy
and
cheerful
coach
and
six
drive
up
to
the
door
before
you
know
it
miss
cinderella
maybe
you
got
some
scheme
under
your
that
will
give
us
a
start
says
i
fifteen
years
older
than
you
are
and
young
enough
yet
to
take
out
an
endowment
policy
i
been
broke
before
we
can
see
the
lights
of
that
town
not
half
a
mile
away
i
learned
under
montague
silver
the
greatest
street
man
that
ever
spoke
from
a
wagon
there
are
hundreds
of
men
walking
those
streets
this
moment
with
grease
spots
on
their
clothes
give
me
a
gasoline
lamp
a
box
and
a
bar
of
white
castile
soap
cut
into
little
your
two
dollars
snickered
bill
bassett
into
my
discourse
there
was
no
use
arguing
with
that
burglar
he
goes
on
both
finance
has
closed
the
mahogany
desk
and
trade
has
put
the
shutters
up
both
of
you
look
to
labor
to
start
the
wheels
going
all
right
you
admit
it
i
show
you
what
bill
bassett
can
do
bassett
tells
me
and
ricks
not
to
leave
the
cabin
till
he
comes
back
even
if
it
daylight
and
then
he
starts
off
toward
town
whistling
gay
this
alfred
ricks
pulls
off
his
shoes
and
his
coat
lays
a
silk
handkerchief
over
his
hat
and
lays
down
on
the
floor
think
i
will
endeavor
to
secure
a
little
slumber
he
squeaks
day
has
been
fatiguing
my
dear
mr
peters
regards
to
morpheus
says
i
think
i
sit
up
a
while
about
two
as
near
as
i
could
guess
by
my
watch
in
peavine
home
comes
our
laboring
man
and
kicks
up
ricks
and
calls
us
to
the
streak
of
bright
moonlight
shining
in
the
cabin
door
then
he
spreads
out
five
packages
of
one
thousand
dollars
each
on
the
floor
and
begins
to
cackle
over
the
like
a
hen
tell
you
a
few
things
about
that
town
says
he
named
rocky
springs
and
they
building
a
masonic
temple
and
it
looks
like
the
democratic
candidate
for
mayor
is
going
to
get
soaked
by
a
pop
and
judge
tucker
wife
who
has
been
down
with
pleurisy
is
getting
some
better
i
had
a
talk
on
these
liliputian
thesises
before
i
could
get
a
siphon
in
the
fountain
of
knowledge
that
i
was
after
and
there
a
bank
there
called
the
lumberman
fidelity
and
savings
institution
it
closed
for
business
yesterday
with
cash
on
hand
it
will
open
this
morning
with
all
silver
that
the
reason
i
did
bring
more
there
you
are
trade
and
capital
now
will
you
be
bad
young
friend
says
alfred
ricks
holding
up
his
hands
you
robbed
this
bank
dear
me
dear
me
could
call
it
that
says
bassett
sounds
harsh
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
find
out
what
street
it
was
on
that
town
is
so
quiet
that
i
could
stand
on
the
corner
and
hear
the
tumblers
clicking
in
that
safe
lock
right
to
left
twice
to
right
once
to
left
to
as
plain
as
the
yale
captain
giving
orders
in
the
football
dialect
now
boys
says
bassett
is
an
early
rising
town
they
tell
me
the
citizens
are
all
up
and
stirring
before
daylight
i
asked
what
for
and
they
said
because
breakfast
was
ready
at
that
time
and
what
of
merry
robin
hood
it
must
be
yoicks
and
away
with
the
tinkers
chorus
i
stake
you
how
much
do
you
want
speak
up
capital
dear
young
friend
says
this
ground
squirrel
of
a
ricks
standing
on
his
hind
legs
and
juggling
nuts
in
his
paws
have
friends
in
denver
who
would
assist
me
if
i
had
a
hundred
dollars
i
basset
unpins
a
package
of
the
currency
and
throws
five
twenties
to
ricks
how
much
he
says
to
me
your
money
up
labor
says
i
never
yet
drew
upon
honest
toil
for
its
pittance
the
dollars
i
get
are
surplus
ones
that
are
burning
the
pockets
of
damfools
and
greenhorns
when
i
stand
on
a
street
corner
and
sell
a
solid
gold
diamond
ring
to
a
yap
for
i
make
just
and
i
know
he
going
to
give
it
to
a
girl
in
return
for
all
the
benefits
accruing
from
a
ring
his
profits
are
which
of
us
is
the
biggest
fakir
when
you
sell
a
poor
woman
a
pinch
of
sand
for
fifty
cents
to
keep
her
lamp
from
exploding
says
bassett
do
you
figure
her
gross
earnings
to
be
with
sand
at
forty
cents
a
ton
says
i
instruct
her
to
keep
her
lamp
clean
and
well
filled
if
she
does
that
it
ca
burst
and
with
the
sand
in
it
she
knows
it
ca
and
she
do
worry
it
a
kind
of
industrial
christian
science
she
pays
fifty
cents
and
gets
both
rockefeller
and
eddy
on
the
job
it
ai
everybody
that
can
let
the
twins
do
their
work
alfred
ricks
all
but
licks
the
dust
off
of
bill
bassett
shoes
dear
young
friend
says
he
will
never
forget
your
generosity
heaven
will
reward
you
but
let
me
implore
you
to
turn
from
your
ways
of
violence
and
crime
says
bill
hole
in
the
wainscoting
for
yours
your
dogmas
and
inculcations
sound
to
me
like
the
last
words
of
a
bicycle
pump
what
has
your
high
moral
system
of
pillage
brought
you
to
penuriousness
and
want
even
brother
peters
who
insists
upon
contaminating
the
art
of
robbery
with
theories
of
commerce
and
trade
admitted
he
was
on
the
lift
both
of
you
live
by
the
gilded
rule
brother
peters
says
bill
better
choose
a
slice
of
this
embalmed
currency
you
welcome
i
told
bill
bassett
once
more
to
put
his
money
in
his
pocket
i
never
had
the
respect
for
burglary
that
some
people
have
i
always
gave
something
for
the
money
i
took
even
if
it
was
only
some
little
trifle
for
a
souvenir
to
remind
not
to
get
caught
again
and
then
alfred
ricks
grovels
at
bill
feet
again
and
bids
us
adieu
he
says
he
will
have
a
team
at
a
farmhouse
and
drive
to
the
station
below
and
take
the
train
for
denver
it
salubrified
the
atmosphere
when
that
lamentable
took
his
departure
he
was
a
disgrace
to
every
profession
in
the
country
with
all
his
big
schemes
and
fine
offices
he
had
wound
up
unable
even
to
get
an
honest
meal
except
by
the
kindness
of
a
strange
and
maybe
unscrupulous
burglar
i
was
glad
to
see
him
go
though
i
felt
a
little
sorry
for
him
now
that
he
was
ruined
forever
what
could
such
a
man
do
without
a
big
capital
to
work
with
why
alfred
ricks
as
we
left
him
was
as
helpless
as
turtle
on
its
back
he
could
have
worked
a
scheme
to
beat
a
little
girl
out
of
a
penny
when
me
and
bill
bassett
was
left
alone
i
did
a
little
turn
in
my
head
with
a
trade
secret
at
the
end
of
it
thinks
i
i
show
this
burglar
man
the
difference
between
business
and
labor
he
had
hurt
some
of
my
professional
by
casting
his
persians
upon
commerce
and
trade
wo
take
any
of
your
money
as
a
gift
bassett
says
i
to
him
if
you
pay
my
expenses
as
a
travelling
companion
until
we
get
out
of
the
danger
zone
of
the
immoral
deficit
you
have
caused
in
this
town
finances
i
be
obliged
bill
bassett
agreed
to
that
and
we
hiked
westward
as
soon
as
we
could
catch
a
safe
train
when
we
got
to
a
town
in
arizona
called
los
perros
i
suggested
that
we
once
more
try
our
luck
on
that
was
the
home
of
montague
silver
my
old
instructor
now
retired
from
business
i
knew
monty
would
stake
me
to
web
money
if
i
could
show
him
a
fly
buzzing
the
locality
bill
bassett
said
all
towns
looked
alike
to
him
as
he
worked
mainly
in
the
dark
so
we
got
off
the
train
in
los
perros
a
fine
little
town
in
the
silver
region
i
had
an
elegant
little
sure
thing
in
the
way
of
a
commercial
slungshot
that
i
intended
to
hit
bassett
behind
the
ear
with
i
going
to
take
his
money
while
he
was
asleep
but
i
was
going
to
leave
him
with
a
lottery
ticket
that
would
represent
in
experience
to
him
i
think
that
was
the
amount
he
had
when
we
got
off
the
train
but
the
first
time
i
hinted
to
him
about
an
investment
he
turns
on
me
and
disencumbers
himself
of
the
following
terms
and
expressions
peters
says
he
ai
a
bad
idea
to
go
into
an
enterprise
of
some
kind
as
you
suggest
i
think
i
will
but
if
i
do
it
will
be
such
a
cold
proposition
that
nobody
but
robert
peary
and
charlie
fairbanks
will
be
able
to
sit
on
the
board
of
directors
thought
you
might
want
to
turn
your
money
over
says
i
do
says
he
i
ca
sleep
on
one
side
all
night
i
tell
you
brother
peters
says
he
going
to
start
a
poker
room
i
do
seem
to
care
for
the
humdrum
in
swindling
such
as
peddling
and
working
off
breakfast
food
on
barnum
and
bailey
for
sawdust
to
strew
in
their
circus
rings
but
the
gambling
business
says
he
the
profitable
side
of
the
table
is
a
good
compromise
between
swiping
silver
spoons
and
selling
penwipers
at
a
charity
bazar
says
i
bassett
you
do
care
to
talk
over
my
little
business
proposition
says
he
you
know
you
ca
get
a
pasteur
institute
to
start
up
within
fifty
miles
of
where
i
live
i
bite
so
seldom
so
bassett
rents
a
room
over
a
saloon
and
looks
around
for
some
furniture
and
chromos
the
same
night
i
went
to
monty
silver
house
and
he
let
me
have
on
my
prospects
then
i
went
to
the
only
store
in
los
perros
that
sold
playing
cards
and
bought
every
deck
in
the
house
the
next
morning
when
the
store
opened
i
was
there
bringing
all
the
cards
back
with
me
i
said
that
my
partner
that
was
going
to
back
me
in
the
game
had
changed
his
mind
and
i
wanted
to
sell
the
cards
back
again
the
storekeeper
took
at
half
price
yes
i
was
dollars
loser
up
to
that
time
but
while
i
had
the
cards
that
night
i
marked
every
one
in
every
deck
that
was
labor
and
then
trade
and
commerce
had
their
innings
and
the
bread
i
had
cast
upon
the
waters
began
to
come
back
in
the
form
of
cottage
pudding
with
wine
sauce
of
course
i
was
among
the
first
to
buy
chips
at
bill
bassett
game
he
had
bought
the
only
cards
there
was
to
be
had
in
town
and
i
knew
the
back
of
every
one
of
them
better
than
i
know
the
back
of
my
head
when
the
barber
shows
me
my
haircut
in
the
two
mirrors
when
the
game
closed
i
had
the
five
thousand
and
a
few
odd
dollars
and
all
bill
bassett
had
was
the
wanderlust
and
a
black
cat
he
had
bought
for
a
mascot
bill
shook
hands
with
me
when
i
left
peters
says
he
have
no
business
being
in
business
i
was
preordained
to
labor
when
a
no
burglar
tries
to
make
a
james
out
of
his
jimmy
he
perpetrates
an
improfundity
you
have
a
and
efficacious
system
of
luck
at
cards
says
he
go
with
you
and
i
never
afterward
sees
bill
bassett
again
well
jeff
said
i
when
the
autolycan
adventurer
seemed
to
have
divulged
the
gist
of
his
tale
i
hope
you
took
care
of
the
money
that
would
be
a
respecta
that
is
a
considerable
working
capital
if
you
should
choose
some
day
to
settle
down
to
some
sort
of
regular
business
me
said
jeff
virtuously
you
can
bet
i
taken
care
of
that
five
thousand
he
tapped
his
coat
over
the
region
of
his
chest
exultantly
gold
mining
stock
he
explained
every
cent
of
it
shares
par
value
one
dollar
bound
to
go
up
per
cent
within
a
year
the
blue
gopher
mine
just
discovered
a
month
ago
better
get
in
yourself
if
you
any
spare
dollars
on
hand
sometimes
said
i
these
mines
are
not
oh
this
one
solid
as
an
old
goose
said
jeff
fifty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
ore
in
sight
and
per
cent
monthly
earnings
guaranteed
he
drew
out
a
long
envelope
from
his
pocket
and
cast
it
on
the
table
always
carry
it
with
me
said
he
so
the
burglar
ca
corrupt
or
the
capitalist
break
in
and
water
it
i
looked
at
the
beautifully
engraved
certificate
of
stock
in
colorado
i
see
said
i
and
by
the
way
jeff
what
was
the
name
of
the
little
man
who
went
to
denver
the
one
you
and
bill
met
at
the
station
alfred
ricks
said
jeff
was
the
toad
designation
i
see
said
i
the
president
of
this
mining
company
signs
himself
fredericks
i
was
wondering
let
me
see
that
stock
said
jeff
quickly
almost
snatching
it
from
me
to
mitigate
even
though
slightly
the
embarrassment
i
summoned
the
waiter
and
ordered
another
bottle
of
the
barbera
i
thought
it
was
the
least
i
could
do
a
tempered
wind
the
first
time
my
optical
nerves
was
disturbed
by
the
sight
of
buckingham
skinner
was
in
kansas
city
i
was
standing
on
a
corner
when
i
see
buck
stick
his
head
out
of
a
window
of
a
business
block
and
holler
whoa
there
whoa
like
you
would
in
endeavoring
to
assuage
a
team
of
runaway
mules
i
looked
around
but
all
the
animals
i
see
in
sight
is
a
policeman
having
his
shoes
shined
and
a
couple
of
delivery
wagons
hitched
to
posts
then
in
a
minute
downstairs
tumbles
this
buckingham
skinner
and
runs
to
the
corner
and
stands
and
gazes
down
the
other
street
at
the
imaginary
dust
kicked
up
by
the
fabulous
hoofs
of
the
fictitious
team
of
chimerical
quadrupeds
and
then
skinner
goes
back
up
to
the
room
again
and
i
see
that
the
lettering
on
the
window
is
the
farmers
friend
loan
company
by
and
by
comes
down
again
and
i
crossed
the
street
to
meet
him
for
i
had
my
ideas
yes
sir
when
i
got
close
i
could
see
where
he
overdone
it
he
was
reub
all
right
as
far
as
his
blue
jeans
and
cowhide
boots
went
but
he
had
a
matinee
actor
hands
and
the
rye
straw
stuck
over
his
ear
looked
like
it
belonged
to
the
property
man
of
the
old
homestead
co
curiosity
to
know
what
his
graft
was
got
the
best
of
me
was
that
your
team
broke
away
and
run
just
now
i
asks
him
polite
i
tried
to
stop
says
i
but
i
could
i
guess
they
half
way
back
to
the
farm
by
now
gosh
blame
them
darned
mules
says
in
a
voice
so
good
that
i
nearly
apologized
they
bustin
loose
and
then
he
looks
at
me
close
and
then
he
takes
off
his
hayseed
hat
and
says
in
a
different
voice
i
like
to
shake
hands
with
parleyvoo
pickens
the
greatest
street
man
in
the
west
barring
only
montague
silver
which
you
can
no
more
than
allow
i
let
him
shake
hands
with
me
i
learned
under
silver
i
said
i
do
begrudge
him
the
lead
but
what
your
graft
son
i
admit
that
the
phantom
flight
of
the
animals
at
which
you
remarked
has
puzzled
me
somewhat
how
do
you
win
out
on
the
trick
buckingham
skinner
blushed
pocket
money
says
he
that
all
i
am
temporarily
unfinanced
this
little
coup
de
rye
straw
is
good
for
forty
dollars
in
a
town
of
this
size
how
do
i
work
it
why
i
involve
myself
as
you
perceive
in
the
loathsome
apparel
of
the
rural
dub
thus
embalmed
i
am
jonas
stubblefield
a
name
impossible
to
improve
upon
i
repair
noisily
to
the
office
of
some
loan
company
conveniently
located
in
the
front
there
i
lay
my
hat
and
yarn
gloves
on
the
floor
and
ask
to
mortgage
my
farm
for
to
pay
for
my
sister
musical
education
in
europe
loans
like
that
always
suit
the
loan
companies
it
ten
to
one
that
when
the
note
falls
due
the
foreclosure
will
be
leading
the
semiquavers
by
a
couple
of
lengths
well
sir
i
reach
in
my
pocket
for
the
abstract
of
title
but
i
suddenly
hear
my
team
running
away
i
run
to
the
window
and
emit
the
word
or
exclamation
it
may
be
viz
then
i
rush
and
down
the
street
returning
in
a
few
minutes
them
mules
i
says
done
run
away
and
busted
the
doubletree
and
two
traces
now
i
got
to
hoof
it
home
for
i
never
brought
no
money
along
reckon
we
talk
about
that
loan
some
other
time
then
i
spreads
out
my
tarpaulin
like
the
israelites
and
waits
for
the
manna
to
drop
no
stubblefield
says
the
party
in
the
specs
and
dotted
pique
vest
us
by
accepting
this
bill
until
get
your
harness
repaired
and
call
in
at
ten
we
be
pleased
to
accommodate
you
in
the
matter
of
this
loan
it
a
slight
thing
says
buckingham
skinner
modest
but
as
i
said
only
for
temporary
loose
change
it
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
says
i
in
respect
for
his
mortification
in
case
of
an
emergency
of
course
it
small
compared
to
organizing
a
trust
or
bridge
whist
but
even
the
chicago
university
had
to
be
started
in
a
small
way
what
your
graft
these
days
buckingham
skinner
asks
me
the
legitimate
says
i
i
handling
rhinestones
and
oleum
sinapi
electric
headache
battery
and
the
swiss
warbler
bird
call
a
small
lot
of
the
new
queer
ones
and
twos
and
the
bonanza
budget
consisting
of
a
wedding
and
engagement
ring
six
egyptian
lily
bulbs
a
combination
pickle
fork
and
and
fifty
engraved
visiting
cards
no
two
names
alike
all
for
the
sum
of
cents
two
months
ago
says
buckingham
skinner
i
was
doing
well
down
in
texas
with
a
patent
instantaneous
fire
kindler
made
of
compressed
wood
ashes
and
benzine
i
sold
loads
of
in
towns
where
they
like
to
burn
niggers
quick
without
having
to
ask
somebody
for
a
light
and
just
when
i
was
doing
the
best
they
strikes
oil
down
there
and
puts
me
out
of
business
machine
too
slow
now
pardner
they
tells
me
can
have
a
coon
in
hell
with
this
here
petroleum
before
your
old
truck
can
get
him
warm
enough
to
perfess
religion
and
so
i
gives
up
the
kindler
and
drifts
up
here
to
this
little
you
seen
me
doing
pickens
with
the
simulated
farm
and
the
hypothetical
teams
ai
in
my
line
at
all
and
i
ashamed
you
found
me
working
it
no
man
says
i
kindly
need
to
be
ashamed
of
putting
the
skibunk
on
a
loan
corporation
for
even
so
small
a
sum
as
ten
dollars
when
he
is
financially
abashed
still
it
was
quite
the
proper
thing
too
much
like
borrowing
money
without
paying
it
back
i
liked
buckingham
skinner
from
the
start
for
as
good
a
man
as
ever
stood
over
the
axles
and
breathed
gasoline
smoke
and
pretty
soon
we
gets
thick
and
i
let
him
in
on
a
scheme
i
had
in
mind
for
some
time
and
offers
to
go
partners
anything
says
buck
that
is
not
actually
dishonest
will
find
me
willing
and
ready
let
us
perforate
into
the
inwardness
of
your
proposition
i
feel
degraded
when
i
am
forced
to
wear
property
straw
in
my
hair
and
assume
a
bucolic
air
for
the
small
sum
of
ten
dollars
actually
pickens
it
makes
me
feel
like
the
ophelia
of
the
great
occidental
consolidated
theatrical
aggregation
this
scheme
of
mine
was
one
that
suited
my
proclivities
by
nature
i
am
some
sentimental
and
have
always
felt
gentle
toward
the
mollifying
elements
of
existence
i
am
disposed
to
be
lenient
with
the
arts
and
sciences
and
i
find
time
to
instigate
a
cordiality
for
the
more
human
works
of
nature
such
as
romance
and
the
atmosphere
and
grass
and
poetry
and
the
seasons
i
never
skin
a
sucker
without
admiring
the
prismatic
beauty
of
his
scales
i
never
sell
a
little
auriferous
beauty
to
the
man
with
the
hoe
without
noticing
the
beautiful
harmony
there
is
between
gold
and
green
and
that
why
i
liked
this
scheme
it
was
so
full
of
outdoor
air
and
landscapes
and
easy
money
we
had
to
have
a
young
lady
assistant
to
help
us
work
this
graft
and
i
asked
buck
if
he
knew
of
one
to
fill
the
bill
one
says
i
that
is
cool
and
wise
and
strictly
business
from
her
pompadour
to
her
oxfords
no
or
or
crayon
portrait
canvassers
for
this
buck
claimed
he
knew
a
suitable
feminine
and
he
takes
me
around
to
see
miss
sarah
malloy
the
minute
i
see
her
i
am
pleased
she
looked
to
be
the
goods
as
ordered
no
sign
of
the
three
p
about
her
no
peroxide
patchouli
nor
peau
de
soie
about
brown
hair
pleasant
ways
the
kind
of
a
lady
for
the
place
a
description
of
the
sandbag
if
you
please
she
begins
why
says
i
this
graft
of
ours
is
so
nice
and
refined
and
romantic
it
would
make
the
balcony
scene
in
and
juliet
look
like
work
we
talked
it
over
and
miss
malloy
agreed
to
come
in
as
a
business
partner
she
said
she
was
glad
to
get
a
chance
to
give
up
her
place
as
stenographer
and
secretary
to
a
suburban
lot
company
and
go
into
something
respectable
this
is
the
way
we
worked
our
scheme
first
i
figured
it
out
by
a
kind
of
a
proverb
the
best
grafts
in
the
world
are
built
up
on
maxims
and
psalms
and
proverbs
and
esau
fables
they
seem
to
kind
of
hit
off
human
nature
our
peaceful
little
swindle
was
constructed
on
the
old
saying
the
whole
push
loves
a
lover
one
evening
buck
and
miss
malloy
drives
up
like
blazes
in
a
buggy
to
a
farmer
door
she
is
pale
but
affectionate
clinging
to
his
arm
always
clinging
to
his
arm
any
one
can
see
that
she
is
a
peach
and
of
the
cling
variety
they
claim
they
are
eloping
for
to
be
married
on
account
of
cruel
parents
they
ask
where
they
can
find
a
preacher
farmer
says
there
ai
any
preacher
nigher
than
reverend
abels
four
miles
over
on
caney
creek
farmeress
wipes
her
hand
on
her
apron
and
rubbers
through
her
specs
illustration
she
is
a
peach
and
of
the
cling
variety
then
lo
and
look
ye
up
the
road
from
the
other
way
jogs
parleyvoo
pickens
in
a
gig
dressed
in
black
white
necktie
long
face
sniffing
his
nose
emitting
a
spurious
kind
of
noise
resembling
the
long
meter
doxology
says
farmer
if
thar
ai
a
preacher
now
it
transpires
that
i
am
rev
abijah
green
travelling
over
to
little
bethel
for
to
preach
next
sunday
the
young
folks
will
have
it
they
must
be
married
for
pa
is
pursuing
them
with
the
plow
mules
and
the
buckboard
so
the
reverend
green
after
hesitating
marries
in
the
farmer
parlor
and
farmer
grins
and
has
in
cider
and
says
and
farmeress
sniffles
a
bit
and
pats
the
bride
on
the
shoulder
and
parleyvoo
pickens
the
wrong
reverend
writes
out
a
marriage
certificate
and
farmer
and
farmeress
sign
it
as
witnesses
and
the
parties
of
the
first
second
and
third
part
gets
in
their
vehicles
and
rides
away
oh
that
was
an
idyllic
graft
true
love
and
the
lowing
kine
and
the
sun
shining
on
the
red
barns
it
certainly
had
all
other
impostures
i
know
about
beat
to
a
batter
so
the
reverend
green
after
hesitations
marries
in
the
farmer
parlor
i
suppose
i
happened
along
in
time
to
marry
buck
and
miss
malloy
at
about
twenty
i
hated
to
think
how
the
romance
was
going
to
fade
later
on
when
all
them
marriage
certificates
turned
up
in
banks
where
we
discounted
and
the
farmers
had
to
pay
them
notes
of
hand
they
signed
running
from
to
on
the
day
of
may
us
three
divided
about
miss
malloy
nearly
cried
with
joy
you
do
often
see
a
tenderhearted
girl
or
one
that
is
bent
on
doing
right
illustration
on
the
day
of
may
us
three
divided
about
boys
says
she
dabbing
her
eyes
with
a
little
handkerchief
this
stake
comes
in
handier
than
a
powder
rag
at
a
fat
men
ball
it
gives
me
a
chance
to
reform
i
was
trying
to
get
out
of
the
real
estate
business
when
you
fellows
came
along
but
if
you
had
taken
me
in
on
this
neat
little
proposition
for
removing
the
cuticle
of
the
rutabaga
propagators
i
afraid
i
have
got
into
something
worse
i
was
about
to
accept
a
place
in
one
of
these
women
auxiliary
bazars
where
they
build
a
parsonage
by
selling
a
spoonful
of
chicken
salad
and
a
for
cents
and
calling
it
a
business
man
lunch
now
i
can
go
into
a
square
honest
business
and
give
all
them
queer
jobs
the
shake
i
going
to
cincinnati
and
start
a
palm
reading
and
clairvoyant
joint
as
madame
saramaloi
the
egyptian
sorceress
i
shall
give
everybody
a
dollar
worth
of
good
honest
prognostication
boys
take
my
advice
and
go
into
some
decent
fake
get
friendly
with
the
police
and
newspapers
and
you
be
all
right
so
then
we
all
shook
hands
and
miss
malloy
left
us
me
and
buck
also
rose
up
and
sauntered
off
a
few
hundred
miles
for
we
did
care
to
be
around
when
them
marriage
certificates
fell
due
with
about
between
us
we
hit
that
bumptious
little
town
off
the
new
jersey
coast
they
call
new
york
if
there
ever
was
an
aviary
overstocked
with
jays
it
is
that
cosmopolitan
they
call
it
you
bet
so
a
piece
of
you
listen
close
when
they
buzzing
and
trying
to
pull
their
feet
out
of
the
sticky
stuff
little
old
new
york
good
enough
for
us
that
what
they
sing
there
enough
reubs
walk
down
broadway
in
one
hour
to
buy
up
a
week
output
of
the
factory
in
augusta
maine
that
makes
knaughty
knovelties
and
the
little
phine
phun
oroide
gold
finger
ring
that
sticks
a
needle
in
your
friend
hand
you
think
new
york
people
was
all
wise
but
no
they
do
get
a
chance
to
learn
everything
too
compressed
even
the
hayseeds
are
baled
hayseeds
but
what
else
can
you
expect
from
a
town
that
shut
off
from
the
world
by
the
ocean
on
one
side
and
new
jersey
on
the
other
it
no
place
for
an
honest
grafter
with
a
small
capital
there
too
big
a
protective
tariff
on
bunco
even
when
giovanni
sells
a
quart
of
warm
worms
and
chestnut
hulls
he
has
to
hand
out
a
pint
to
an
insectivorous
cop
and
the
hotel
man
charges
double
for
everything
in
the
bill
that
he
sends
by
the
patrol
wagon
to
the
altar
where
the
duke
is
about
to
marry
the
heiress
but
old
is
the
ideal
burg
for
a
refined
piece
of
piracy
if
you
can
pay
the
bunco
duty
imported
grafts
come
pretty
high
the
officers
that
look
after
it
carry
clubs
and
it
hard
to
smuggle
in
even
a
swindle
to
work
brooklyn
with
unless
you
can
pay
the
toll
but
now
me
and
buck
having
capital
descends
upon
new
york
to
try
and
trade
the
metropolitan
backwoodsmen
a
few
glass
beads
for
real
estate
just
as
the
vans
did
a
hundred
or
two
years
ago
at
an
east
side
hotel
we
gets
acquainted
with
romulus
atterbury
a
man
with
the
finest
head
for
financial
operations
i
ever
saw
it
was
all
bald
and
glossy
except
for
gray
side
whiskers
seeing
that
head
behind
an
office
railing
and
you
deposit
a
million
with
it
without
a
receipt
this
atterbury
was
well
dressed
though
he
ate
seldom
and
the
synopsis
of
his
talk
would
make
the
conversation
of
a
siren
sound
like
a
cab
driver
kick
he
said
he
used
to
be
a
member
of
the
stock
exchange
but
some
of
the
big
capitalists
got
jealous
and
formed
a
ring
that
forced
him
to
sell
his
seat
atterbury
got
to
liking
me
and
buck
and
he
begun
to
throw
on
the
canvas
for
us
some
of
the
schemes
that
had
caused
his
hair
to
evacuate
he
had
one
scheme
for
starting
a
national
bank
on
that
made
the
mississippi
bubble
look
as
solid
as
a
glass
marble
he
talked
this
to
us
for
three
days
and
when
his
throat
was
good
and
sore
we
told
him
about
the
roll
we
had
atterbury
borrowed
a
quarter
from
us
and
went
out
and
got
a
box
of
throat
lozenges
and
started
all
over
again
this
time
he
talked
bigger
things
and
he
got
us
to
see
as
he
did
the
scheme
he
laid
out
looked
like
a
sure
winner
and
he
talked
me
and
buck
into
putting
our
capital
against
his
burnished
dome
of
thought
it
looked
all
right
for
a
graft
it
seemed
to
be
just
about
an
inch
and
a
half
outside
of
the
reach
of
the
police
and
as
as
a
mint
it
was
just
what
me
and
buck
wanted
a
regular
business
at
a
permanent
stand
with
an
open
air
spieling
with
tonsilitis
on
the
street
corners
every
evening
so
in
six
weeks
you
see
a
handsome
furnished
set
of
offices
down
in
the
wall
street
neighborhood
with
the
golconda
gold
bond
and
investment
company
in
gilt
letters
on
the
door
and
you
see
in
his
private
room
with
the
door
open
the
secretary
and
treasurer
buckingham
skinner
costumed
like
the
lilies
of
the
conservatory
with
his
high
silk
hat
close
to
his
hand
nobody
yet
ever
saw
buck
outside
of
an
instantaneous
reach
for
his
hat
and
you
might
perceive
the
president
and
general
manager
atterbury
with
his
priceless
polished
poll
busy
in
the
main
office
room
dictating
letters
to
a
shorthand
countess
who
has
got
pomp
and
a
pompadour
that
is
no
less
than
a
guarantee
to
investors
illustration
busy
in
the
main
office
room
dictating
letters
to
a
shorthand
countess
there
is
a
bookkeeper
and
an
assistant
and
a
general
atmosphere
of
varnish
and
culpability
at
another
desk
the
eye
is
relieved
by
the
sight
of
an
ordinary
man
attired
with
unscrupulous
plainness
sitting
with
his
feet
up
eating
apples
with
his
obnoxious
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
that
man
is
no
other
than
colonel
tecumseh
once
parleyvoo
pickens
the
of
the
company
no
recherché
rags
for
me
i
says
to
atterbury
when
we
was
organizing
the
stage
properties
of
the
robbery
i
a
plain
man
says
i
and
i
do
not
use
pajamas
french
or
military
cast
me
for
the
role
of
the
or
i
do
go
on
exhibition
if
you
can
use
me
in
my
natural
though
displeasing
form
do
so
dress
you
up
says
atterbury
i
should
say
not
just
as
you
are
you
worth
more
to
the
business
than
a
whole
roomful
of
the
things
they
pin
chrysanthemums
on
you
to
play
the
part
of
the
solid
but
disheveled
capitalist
from
the
far
west
you
despise
the
conventions
you
got
so
many
stocks
you
can
afford
to
shake
socks
conservative
homely
rough
shrewd
saving
that
your
pose
it
a
winner
in
new
york
keep
your
feet
on
the
desk
and
eat
apples
whenever
anybody
comes
in
eat
an
apple
let
see
you
stuff
the
peelings
in
a
drawer
of
your
desk
look
as
economical
and
rich
and
rugged
as
you
can
i
followed
out
atterbury
instructions
i
played
the
rocky
mountain
capitalist
without
ruching
or
frills
the
way
i
deposited
apple
peelings
to
my
credit
in
a
drawer
when
any
customers
came
in
made
hetty
green
look
like
a
spendthrift
i
could
hear
atterbury
saying
to
victims
as
he
smiled
at
me
indulgent
and
venerating
that
our
colonel
pickens
fortune
in
western
investments
delightfully
plain
manners
but
could
sign
his
check
for
half
a
million
simple
as
a
child
wonderful
head
conservative
and
careful
almost
to
a
fault
illustration
that
our
colonel
pickens
atterbury
managed
the
business
me
and
buck
never
quite
understood
all
of
it
though
he
explained
it
to
us
in
full
it
seems
the
company
was
a
kind
of
cooperative
one
and
everybody
that
bought
stock
shared
in
the
profits
first
we
officers
bought
up
a
controlling
interest
we
had
to
have
that
of
the
shares
at
cents
a
hundred
just
what
the
printer
charged
us
and
the
rest
went
to
the
public
at
a
dollar
each
the
company
guaranteed
the
stockholders
a
profit
of
ten
per
cent
each
month
payable
on
the
last
day
thereof
when
any
stockholder
had
paid
in
as
much
as
the
company
issued
him
a
gold
bond
and
he
became
a
bondholder
i
asked
atterbury
one
day
what
benefits
and
appurtenances
these
gold
bonds
was
to
an
investor
more
so
than
the
immunities
and
privileges
enjoyed
by
the
common
sucker
who
only
owned
stock
atterbury
picked
up
one
of
them
gold
bonds
all
gilt
and
lettered
up
with
flourishes
and
a
big
red
seal
tied
with
a
blue
ribbon
in
a
bowknot
and
he
looked
at
me
like
his
feelings
was
hurt
my
dear
colonel
pickens
says
he
you
have
no
soul
for
art
think
of
a
thousand
homes
made
happy
by
possessing
one
of
these
beautiful
gems
of
the
lithographer
skill
think
of
the
joy
in
the
household
where
one
of
these
gold
bonds
hangs
by
a
pink
cord
to
the
or
is
chewed
by
the
baby
caroling
gleefully
upon
the
floor
ah
i
see
your
eye
growing
moist
colonel
i
have
touched
you
have
i
not
you
have
not
says
i
for
i
been
watching
you
the
moisture
you
see
is
apple
juice
you
ca
expect
one
man
to
act
as
a
human
and
an
art
connoisseur
too
atterbury
attended
to
the
details
of
the
concern
as
i
understand
it
they
was
simple
the
investors
in
stock
paid
in
their
money
and
well
i
guess
that
all
they
had
to
do
the
company
received
it
and
i
do
call
to
mind
anything
else
me
and
buck
knew
more
about
selling
corn
salve
than
we
did
about
wall
street
but
even
we
could
see
how
the
golconda
gold
bond
investment
company
was
making
money
you
take
in
money
and
pay
back
ten
per
cent
of
it
it
plain
enough
that
you
make
a
clean
legitimate
profit
of
per
less
expenses
as
long
as
the
fish
bite
atterbury
wanted
to
be
president
and
treasurer
too
but
buck
winks
an
eye
at
him
and
says
you
was
to
furnish
the
brains
do
you
call
it
good
brain
work
when
you
propose
to
take
in
money
at
the
door
too
think
again
i
hereby
nominate
myself
treasurer
ad
valorem
sine
die
and
by
acclamation
i
chip
in
that
much
brain
work
free
me
and
pickens
we
furnished
the
capital
and
we
handle
the
unearned
increment
as
it
incremates
it
costs
us
for
office
rent
and
first
payment
on
furniture
more
went
for
printing
and
advertising
atterbury
knew
his
business
three
months
to
a
minute
we
last
says
he
a
day
longer
than
that
and
we
have
to
either
go
under
or
go
under
an
alias
by
that
time
we
ought
to
clean
up
and
then
a
money
belt
and
a
lower
berth
for
me
and
the
yellow
journals
and
the
furniture
men
can
pick
the
bones
our
ads
done
the
work
country
weeklies
and
washington
dailies
of
course
says
i
when
we
was
ready
to
make
contracts
man
says
atterbury
as
its
advertising
manager
you
would
cause
a
limburger
cheese
factory
to
remain
undiscovered
during
a
hot
summer
the
game
we
after
is
right
here
in
new
york
and
brooklyn
and
the
harlem
they
the
people
that
the
fenders
and
the
answers
to
correspondents
columns
and
the
pickpocket
notices
are
made
for
we
want
our
ads
in
the
biggest
city
dailies
top
of
column
next
to
editorials
on
radium
and
pictures
of
the
girl
doing
health
exercises
pretty
soon
the
money
begins
to
roll
in
buck
did
have
to
pretend
to
be
busy
his
desk
was
piled
high
up
with
money
orders
and
checks
and
greenbacks
people
began
to
drop
in
the
office
and
buy
stock
every
day
most
of
the
shares
went
in
small
amounts
and
and
and
a
good
many
and
lots
and
the
bald
and
inviolate
cranium
of
president
atterbury
shines
with
enthusiasm
and
demerit
while
colonel
tecumseh
pickens
the
rude
but
reputable
croesus
of
the
west
consumes
so
many
apples
that
the
peelings
hang
to
the
floor
from
the
mahogany
garbage
chest
that
he
calls
his
desk
just
as
atterbury
said
we
ran
along
about
three
months
without
being
troubled
buck
cashed
the
paper
as
fast
as
it
came
in
and
kept
the
money
in
a
safe
deposit
vault
a
block
or
so
away
buck
never
thought
much
of
banks
for
such
purposes
we
paid
the
interest
regular
on
the
stock
we
sold
so
there
was
nothing
for
anybody
to
squeal
about
we
had
nearly
on
hand
and
all
three
of
us
had
been
living
as
high
as
prize
fighters
out
of
training
one
morning
as
me
and
buck
sauntered
into
the
office
fat
and
flippant
from
our
noon
grub
we
met
an
fellow
with
a
bright
eye
and
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
coming
out
we
found
atterbury
looking
like
he
been
caught
a
mile
from
home
in
a
wet
shower
know
that
man
he
asked
us
we
said
we
did
i
do
either
says
atterbury
wiping
off
his
head
but
i
bet
enough
gold
bonds
to
paper
a
cell
in
the
tombs
that
he
a
newspaper
reporter
what
did
he
want
asks
buck
information
says
our
president
said
he
was
thinking
of
buying
some
stock
he
asked
me
about
nine
hundred
questions
and
every
one
of
hit
some
sore
place
in
the
business
i
know
he
on
a
paper
you
ca
fool
me
you
see
a
man
about
half
shabby
with
an
eye
like
a
gimlet
smoking
cut
plug
with
dandruff
on
his
coat
collar
and
knowing
more
than
morgan
and
shakespeare
put
together
if
that
ai
a
reporter
i
never
saw
one
i
was
afraid
of
this
i
do
mind
detectives
and
inspectors
i
talk
to
eight
minutes
and
then
sell
stock
but
them
reporters
take
the
starch
out
of
my
collar
boys
i
recommend
that
we
declare
a
dividend
and
fade
away
the
signs
point
that
way
me
and
buck
talked
to
atterbury
and
got
him
to
stop
sweating
and
stand
still
that
fellow
did
look
like
a
reporter
to
us
reporters
always
pull
out
a
pencil
and
tablet
on
you
and
tell
you
a
story
heard
and
strikes
you
for
the
drinks
but
atterbury
was
shaky
and
nervous
all
day
the
next
day
me
and
buck
comes
down
from
the
hotel
about
on
the
way
we
buys
the
papers
and
the
first
thing
we
see
is
a
column
on
the
front
page
about
our
little
imposition
it
was
a
shame
the
way
that
reporter
intimated
that
we
were
no
blood
relatives
of
the
late
george
childs
he
tells
all
about
the
scheme
as
he
sees
it
in
a
rich
racy
kind
of
a
guying
style
that
might
amuse
most
anybody
except
a
stockholder
yes
atterbury
was
right
it
behooveth
the
gaily
clad
treasurer
and
the
pearly
pated
president
and
the
rugged
of
the
golconda
gold
bond
and
investment
company
to
go
away
real
sudden
and
quick
that
their
days
might
be
longer
upon
the
land
me
and
buck
hurries
down
to
the
office
we
finds
on
the
stairs
and
in
the
hall
a
crowd
of
people
trying
to
squeeze
into
our
office
which
is
already
jammed
full
inside
to
the
railing
they
nearly
all
got
golconda
stock
and
gold
bonds
in
their
hands
me
and
buck
judged
they
been
reading
the
papers
too
we
stopped
and
looked
at
our
stockholders
some
surprised
it
quite
the
kind
of
a
gang
we
supposed
had
been
investing
they
all
looked
like
poor
people
there
was
plenty
of
old
women
and
lots
of
young
girls
that
you
say
worked
in
factories
and
mills
some
was
old
men
that
looked
like
war
veterans
and
some
was
crippled
and
a
good
many
was
just
kids
bootblacks
and
newsboys
and
messengers
some
was
in
overalls
with
their
sleeves
rolled
up
not
one
of
the
gang
looked
like
a
stockholder
in
anything
unless
it
was
a
peanut
stand
but
they
all
had
golconda
stock
and
looked
as
sick
as
you
please
illustration
but
they
all
had
golconda
stock
and
looked
as
sick
as
you
please
i
saw
a
queer
kind
of
a
pale
look
come
on
buck
face
when
he
sized
up
the
crowd
he
stepped
up
to
a
sickly
looking
woman
and
says
madam
do
you
own
any
of
this
stock
i
put
in
a
hundred
dollars
says
the
woman
faint
like
it
was
all
i
had
saved
in
a
year
one
of

a
big
bundle
and
then
buck
and
me
takes
the
journalist
reporter
around
to
another
door
and
we
let
ourselves
into
one
of
the
office
rooms
now
my
literary
friend
says
buck

a
chair
and

from

point
comfort
to
the
golden
gate
we
grafted
a
dollar
whenever
we
saw
one
that
had
a
surplus
look
to
it
but
we
never
went
after
the
simoleon
in
the
toe
of
the
sock
under
the
loose
brick
in
the
corner
of
the
kitchen
hearth
there
an
old
saying
you
may
have
heard
decency
averni
which
means
it
an
easy
slide
from
the
street
faker
dry
goods
box
to
a
desk
in
wall
street
we
took
that
slide
but
we
did
know
exactly
what
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
now
you
ought
to
be
wise
but
you
ai
you
got
new
york
wiseness
which
means
that
you
judge
a
man
by
the
outside
of
his
clothes
that
ai
right
you
ought
to
look
at
the
lining
and
seams
and
the
while
we
are
waiting
for
the
patrol
wagon
you
might
get
out
your
little
stub
pencil
and
take
notes
for
another
funny
piece
in
the
paper
and
then
buck
turns
to
me
and
says
i
do
care
what
atterbury
thinks
he
only
put
in
brains
and
if
he
gets
his
capital

lucky
but

says
i
you
ought
to
know
me
buck
i
did
know
who
was
buying
the
stock
all
right
says
buck
and
then
he
goes
through
the
inside
door
into
the
main
office
and
looks
at
the
gang
trying
to
squeeze
through
the
railing
atterbury
and
his
hat
was
gone
and
buck
makes
a
short
speech
all
you
lambs
get
in
line
you
going
to
get
your
wool
back
shove
so
get
in
a
line

not

say
here
pick
come
and
straighten
out
and
let
through
and
out
by
the
other
door
buck
takes
off
his
coat
pushes
his
silk
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
lights
up
a
reina
victoria
he
sets
at
the
table
with
the
boodle
before
him
all
done
up
in
neat
packages
i
gets
the
stockholders
strung
out
and
marches
single
file
through
from
the
main
room
and
the
reporter
man
passes
out
of
the
side
door
into
the
hall
again
as
they
go
by
buck
takes
up
the
stock
and
the
gold
bonds
paying
cash
dollar
for
dollar
the
same
as
they
paid
in
the
shareholders
of
the
golconda
gold
bond
and
investment
company
hardly
believe
it
they
almost
grabs
the
money
out
of
buck
hands
some
of
the
women
keep
on
crying
for
it
a
custom
of
the
sex
to
cry
when
they
have
sorrow
to
weep
when
they
have
joy
and
to
shed
tears
whenever
they
find
themselves
without
either
illustration
the
shareholders
of
the
golconda
gold
bond
and
investment
company
ca
hardly
believe
it
the
old
women
fingers
shake
when
they
stuff
the
skads
in
the
bosom
of
their
rusty
dresses
the
factory
girls
just
stoop
over
and
flap
their
dry
goods
a
second
and
you
hear
the
elastic
go
pop
as
the
currency
goes
down
in
the
ladies
department
of
the
old
domestic
bank
some
of
the
stockholders
that
had
been
doing
the
jeremiah
act
the
loudest
outside
had
spasms
of
restored
confidence
and
wanted
to
leave
the
money
invested
salt
away
that
chicken
feed
in
your
duds
and
skip
along
says
buck
what
business
have
you
got
investing
in
bonds
the
or
the
crack
in
the
wall
behind
the
clock
for
your
hoard
of
pennies
when
the
pretty
girl
in
the
red
shawl
cashes
in
buck
hands
her
an
extra
twenty
a
wedding
present
says
our
treasurer
from
the
golconda
company
and
say
if
jakey
ever
follows
his
nose
even
at
a
respectful
distance
around
the
corner
where
rosa
steinfeld
lives
you
are
hereby
authorized
to
knock
a
couple
of
inches
of
it
off
when
they
was
all
paid
off
and
gone
buck
calls
the
newspaper
reporter
and
shoves
the
rest
of
the
money
over
to
him
you
begun
this
says
buck
now
finish
it
over
there
are
the
books
showing
every
share
and
bond
issued

the
money
to
cover
except
what
we
spent
to
live
on
you
have
to
act
as
receiver
i
guess
you
do
the
square
thing
on
account
of
your
paper

is
the
best
way
we
know
how
to
settle
it
me
and
our
substantial
but
are
going
to
follow
the
example
of
our
revered
president
and
skip
now
have
you
got
enough
news
for
or
do
you
want
to
interview
us
on
etiquette
and
the
best
way
to
make
over
an
old
taffeta
skirt
news
says
the
newspaper
man
taking
his
pipe
out
do
you
think
i
could
use
this
i
do
want
to
lose
my
job
suppose

go
around
to
the
office
and

what
the
managing
editor
say
he
just
hand
me
a
pass
to
bellevue
and
tell
me
to
come
back
when
i
get
cured
i
might
turn
in
a
story
about
a
sea
serpent
wiggling
up
broadway
but
i
have
got
the
nerve
to
try
with
a
pipe
like
this
a
scheme
excuse
me

giving
back
the
boodle
oh

not
on
the
comic
supplement

ca
understand
it
of
course
says
buck
with
his
hand
on
the
door
knob
me
and
pick
ai
wall
streeters
like
you
know
we
never
allowed
to
swindle
sick
old
women
and
working
girls
and
take
nickels
off
of
kids
in
the
lines
of
graft
we
worked
we
took
money
from
the
people
the
lord
made
to
be
buncoed
sports
and
rounders
and
smart
alecks
and
street
crowds
that
always
have
a
few
dollars
to
throw
away
and
farmers
that
would
ever
be
happy
if
the
grafters
did
come
around
and
play
with
when
they
sold
their
crops
we
never
cared
to
fish
for
the
kind
of
suckers
that
bite
here
no
sir
we
got
too
much
respect
for
the
profession
and
for
ourselves
to
you
mr
receiver
here
says
the
journalist
reporter
wait
a
minute
there
a
broker
i
know
on
the
next
floor
wait
till
i
put
this
truck
in
his
safe
i
want
you
fellows
to
take
a
drink
on
me
before
you
go
on
you
says
buck
winking
solemn
do
you
go
and
try
to
make
believe
at
the
office
you
said
that
thanks
we
ca
spare
the
time
i
reckon
so
long
and
me
and
buck
slides
out
the
door
and
that
the
way
the
golconda
company
went
into
involuntary
liquefaction
if
you
had
seen
me
and
buck
the
next
night
you
have
had
to
go
to
a
little
bum
hotel
over
near
the
west
side
ferry
landings
we
was
in
a
little
back
room
and
i
was
filling
up
a
gross
of
bottles
with
hydrant
water
colored
red
with
aniline
and
flavored
with
cinnamon
buck
was
smoking
contented
and
he
wore
a
decent
brown
derby
in
place
of
his
silk
hat
it
a
good
thing
pick
says
he
as
he
drove
in
the
corks
that
we
got
brady
to
lend
us
his
horse
and
wagon
for
a
week
we
rustle
up
the
stake
by
then
this
hair
tonic
sell
right
along
over
in
jersey
bald
heads
ai
popular
over
there
on
account
of
the
mosquitoes
directly
i
dragged
out
my
valise
and
went
down
in
it
for
labels
hair
tonic
labels
are
out
says
i
only
about
a
dozen
on
hand
buy
some
more
says
buck
we
investigated
our
pockets
and
found
we
had
just
enough
money
to
settle
our
hotel
bill
in
the
morning
and
pay
our
passage
over
the
ferry
plenty
of
the
chill
cure
labels
says
i
after
looking
what
more
do
you
want
says
buck
slap
on
the
chill
season
is
just
opening
up
in
the
hackensack
low
grounds
what
hair
anyway
if
you
have
to
shake
it
off
we
pasted
on
the
chill
cure
labels
about
half
an
hour
and
buck
says
making
an
honest
livin
better
than
that
wall
street
anyhow
it
pick
you
bet
says
i
hostages
to
momus
i
i
never
got
inside
of
the
legitimate
line
of
graft
but
once
but
one
time
as
i
say
i
reversed
the
decision
of
the
revised
statutes
and
undertook
a
thing
that
i
have
to
apologize
for
even
under
the
new
jersey
trust
laws
me
and
caligula
polk
of
muskogee
in
the
creek
nation
was
down
in
the
mexican
state
of
tamaulipas
running
a
peripatetic
lottery
and
monte
game
now
selling
lottery
tickets
is
a
government
graft
in
mexico
just
like
selling
cents
worth
of
for
cents
is
over
here
so
uncle
porfirio
he
instructs
the
to
attend
to
our
case
they
a
sort
of
country
police
but
do
draw
any
mental
crayon
portraits
of
the
worthy
constables
with
a
tin
star
and
a
gray
goatee
the
well
if
we
mount
our
supreme
court
on
broncos
arm
with
winchesters
and
start
out
after
john
doe
we
have
about
the
same
thing
when
the
started
for
us
we
started
for
the
states
they
chased
us
as
far
as
matamoras
we
hid
in
a
brickyard
and
that
night
we
swum
the
rio
grande
caligula
with
a
brick
in
each
hand
which
he
drops
upon
the
soil
of
texas
forgetting
he
had
from
there
we
emigrated
to
san
antone
and
then
over
to
new
orleans
where
we
took
a
rest
and
in
that
town
of
cotton
bales
and
other
adjuncts
to
female
beauty
we
made
the
acquaintance
of
drinks
invented
by
the
creoles
during
the
period
of
louey
cans
in
which
they
are
still
served
at
the
side
doors
the
most
i
can
remember
of
this
town
is
that
me
and
caligula
and
a
frenchman
named
mccarty
wait
a
minute
adolph
mccarty
was
trying
to
make
the
french
quarter
pay
up
the
back
due
on
the
louisiana
purchase
when
somebody
hollers
that
the
johndarms
are
coming
i
have
an
insufficient
recollection
of
buying
two
yellow
tickets
through
a
window
and
i
seemed
to
see
a
man
swing
a
lantern
and
say
all
aboard
i
remembered
no
more
except
that
the
train
butcher
was
covering
me
and
caligula
up
with
augusta
evans
works
and
figs
when
we
become
revised
we
find
that
we
have
collided
up
against
the
state
of
georgia
at
a
spot
hitherto
unaccounted
for
in
time
tables
except
by
an
asterisk
which
means
that
trains
stop
every
other
thursday
on
signal
by
tearing
up
a
rail
we
was
waked
up
in
a
yellow
pine
hotel
by
the
noise
of
flowers
and
the
smell
of
birds
yes
sir
for
the
wind
was
banging
sunflowers
as
big
as
buggy
wheels
against
the
weatherboarding
and
the
chicken
coop
was
right
under
the
window
me
and
caligula
dressed
and
went
the
landlord
was
shelling
peas
on
the
front
porch
he
was
six
feet
of
chills
and
fever
and
hongkong
in
complexion
though
in
other
respects
he
seemed
amenable
in
the
exercise
of
his
sentiments
and
features
caligula
who
is
a
spokesman
by
birth
and
a
small
man
though
and
impatient
of
painfulness
of
any
kind
speaks
up
pardner
says
he
and
be
darned
to
you
would
you
mind
telling
us
why
we
are
at
we
know
the
reason
we
are
where
but
ca
exactly
figure
out
on
account
of
at
what
place
well
gentlemen
says
the
landlord
i
reckoned
would
be
inquiring
this
morning
dropped
off
of
the
train
here
last
night
and
you
was
right
tight
yes
you
was
right
smart
in
liquor
i
can
inform
you
that
you
are
now
in
the
town
of
mountain
valley
in
the
state
of
georgia
on
top
of
that
says
caligula
do
say
that
we
ca
have
anything
to
eat
sit
down
gentlemen
says
the
landlord
and
in
twenty
minutes
call
you
to
the
best
breakfast
you
can
get
anywhere
in
town
that
breakfast
turned
out
to
be
composed
of
fried
bacon
and
a
yellowish
edifice
that
proved
up
something
between
pound
cake
and
flexible
sandstone
the
landlord
calls
it
corn
pone
and
then
he
sets
out
a
dish
of
the
exaggerated
breakfast
food
known
as
hominy
and
so
me
and
caligula
makes
the
acquaintance
of
the
celebrated
food
that
enabled
every
johnny
reb
to
lick
one
and
yankees
for
nearly
four
years
at
a
stretch
the
wonder
to
me
is
says
caligula
that
uncle
robert
lee
boys
did
chase
the
grant
and
sherman
outfit
clear
up
into
hudson
bay
it
would
have
made
me
that
mad
to
eat
this
truck
they
call
mahogany
hog
and
hominy
i
explains
is
the
staple
food
of
this
section
then
says
caligula
they
ought
to
keep
it
where
it
belongs
i
thought
this
was
a
hotel
and
not
a
stable
now
if
we
was
in
muskogee
at
the
lucifer
house
i
show
you
some
breakfast
grub
antelope
steaks
and
fried
liver
to
begin
on
and
venison
cutlets
with
con
and
pineapple
fritters
and
then
some
sardines
and
mixed
pickles
and
top
it
off
with
a
can
of
yellow
clings
and
a
bottle
of
beer
you
wo
find
a
layout
like
that
on
the
bill
of
affairs
of
any
of
your
eastern
restauraws
too
lavish
says
i
i
traveled
and
i
unprejudiced
never
be
a
perfect
breakfast
eaten
until
some
man
grows
arms
long
enough
to
stretch
down
to
new
orleans
for
his
coffee
and
over
to
norfolk
for
his
rolls
and
reaches
up
to
vermont
and
digs
a
slice
of
butter
out
of
a
and
then
turns
over
a
beehive
close
to
a
white
clover
patch
out
in
indiana
for
the
rest
then
he
come
pretty
close
to
making
a
meal
on
the
amber
that
the
gods
eat
on
mount
olympia
too
ephemeral
says
caligula
i
want
ham
and
eggs
or
rabbit
stew
anyhow
for
a
chaser
what
do
you
consider
the
most
edifying
and
casual
in
the
way
of
a
dinner
i
been
infatuated
from
time
to
time
i
answers
with
fancy
ramifications
of
grub
such
as
terrapins
lobsters
reed
birds
jambolaya
and
ducks
but
after
all
there
nothing
less
displeasing
to
me
than
a
beefsteak
smothered
in
mushrooms
on
a
balcony
in
sound
of
the
broadway
streetcars
with
a
playing
down
below
and
the
boys
hollering
extras
about
the
latest
suicide
for
the
wine
give
me
a
reasonable
ponty
cany
and
all
except
a
well
says
caligula
i
reckon
in
new
york
you
get
to
be
a
conniseer
and
when
you
go
around
with
the
you
are
naturally
bound
to
buy
stylish
grub
it
a
great
town
for
epicures
says
i
you
soon
fall
into
their
ways
if
you
was
there
i
heard
it
was
says
caligula
but
i
reckon
i
would
i
can
polish
my
fingernails
all
they
need
myself
ii
after
breakfast
we
went
out
on
the
front
porch
lighted
up
two
of
the
landlord
de
perfectos
and
took
a
look
at
georgia
the
installment
of
scenery
visible
to
the
eye
looked
mighty
poor
as
far
as
we
could
see
was
red
hills
all
washed
down
with
gullies
and
scattered
over
with
patches
of
piny
woods
blackberry
bushes
was
all
that
kept
the
rail
fences
from
falling
down
about
fifteen
miles
over
to
the
north
was
a
little
range
of
mountains
that
town
of
mountain
valley
was
going
about
a
dozen
people
permeated
along
the
sidewalks
but
what
you
saw
mostly
was
and
roosters
and
boys
poking
around
with
sticks
in
piles
of
ashes
made
by
burning
the
scenery
of
uncle
tom
shows
and
just
then
there
passes
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
a
high
man
in
a
long
black
coat
and
a
beaver
hat
all
the
people
in
sight
bowed
and
some
crossed
the
street
to
shake
hands
with
him
folks
came
out
of
stores
and
houses
to
holler
at
him
women
leaned
out
of
windows
and
smiled
and
all
the
kids
stopped
playing
to
look
at
him
our
landlord
stepped
out
on
the
porch
and
bent
himself
double
like
a
carpenter
rule
and
sung
out
colonel
when
he
was
a
dozen
yards
gone
by
and
is
that
alexander
pa
says
caligula
to
the
landlord
and
why
is
he
called
great
that
gentlemen
says
the
landlord
is
no
less
than
colonel
jackson
rockingham
the
president
of
the
sunrise
edenville
tap
railroad
mayor
of
mountain
valley
and
chairman
of
the
perry
county
board
of
immigration
and
public
improvements
been
away
a
good
many
years
has
he
i
asked
no
sir
colonel
rockingham
is
going
down
to
the
for
his
mail
his
take
pleasure
in
greeting
him
thus
every
morning
the
colonel
is
our
most
prominent
citizen
besides
the
height
of
the
stock
of
the
sunrise
edenville
tap
railroad
he
owns
a
thousand
acres
of
that
land
across
the
creek
mountain
valley
delights
sir
to
honor
a
citizen
of
such
worth
and
public
spirit
for
an
hour
that
afternoon
caligula
sat
on
the
back
of
his
neck
on
the
porch
and
studied
a
newspaper
which
was
unusual
in
a
man
who
despised
print
when
he
was
through
he
took
me
to
the
end
of
the
porch
among
the
sunlight
and
drying
i
knew
that
caligula
had
invented
a
new
graft
for
he
chewed
the
ends
of
his
mustache
and
ran
the
left
catch
of
his
suspenders
up
and
down
which
was
his
way
what
is
it
now
i
asks
just
so
it
ai
floating
mining
stocks
or
raising
pennsylvania
pinks
we
talk
it
over
pennsylvania
pinks
oh
that
refers
to
a
scheme
of
the
keystoners
they
burn
the
soles
of
old
women
feet
to
make
them
tell
where
their
money
hid
caligula
words
in
business
was
always
few
and
bitter
you
see
them
mountains
said
he
pointing
and
you
seen
that
colonel
man
that
owns
railroads
and
cuts
more
ice
when
he
goes
to
the
than
roosevelt
does
when
he
cleans
out
what
going
to
do
is
to
kidnap
the
latter
into
the
former
and
inflict
a
ransom
of
ten
thousand
dollars
illegality
says
i
shaking
my
head
i
knew
you
say
that
says
caligula
at
first
sight
it
does
seem
to
jar
peace
and
dignity
but
it
do
i
got
the
idea
out
of
that
newspaper
would
you
commit
aspersions
on
a
equitable
graft
that
the
united
states
itself
has
condoned
and
indorsed
and
ratified
kidnapping
says
i
is
an
immoral
function
in
the
derogatory
list
of
the
statutes
if
the
united
states
upholds
it
it
must
be
a
recent
enactment
of
ethics
along
with
race
suicide
and
rural
delivery
listen
says
caligula
and
i
explain
the
case
set
down
in
the
papers
here
was
a
greek
citizen
named
burdick
harris
says
he
captured
for
a
graft
by
africans
and
the
united
states
sends
two
gunboats
to
the
state
of
tangiers
and
makes
the
king
of
morocco
give
up
seventy
thousand
dollars
to
raisuli
go
slow
says
i
that
sounds
too
international
to
take
in
all
at
once
it
like
thimble
who
got
the
naturalization
papers
was
press
despatches
from
constantinople
says
caligula
see
six
months
from
now
they
be
confirmed
by
the
monthly
magazines
and
then
it
wo
be
long
till
you
notice
alongside
the
photos
of
the
mount
pelee
eruption
photos
in
the
weeklies
it
all
right
pick
this
african
man
raisuli
hides
burdick
harris
up
in
the
mountains
and
advertises
his
price
to
the
governments
of
different
nations
now
you
would
think
for
a
minute
goes
on
caligula
that
john
hay
would
have
chipped
in
and
helped
this
graft
along
if
it
was
a
square
game
would
you
why
no
says
i
i
always
stood
right
in
with
bryan
policies
and
i
could
consciously
say
a
word
against
the
republican
administration
just
now
but
if
harris
was
a
greek
on
what
system
of
international
protocols
did
hay
interfere
it
ai
exactly
set
forth
in
the
papers
says
caligula
i
suppose
it
a
matter
of
sentiment
you
know
he
wrote
this
poem
breeches
and
them
greeks
wear
little
or
none
but
anyhow
john
hay
sends
the
brooklyn
and
the
olympia
over
and
they
cover
africa
with
guns
and
then
hay
cables
after
the
health
of
the
how
are
they
this
morning
he
wires
burdick
harris
alive
yet
or
raisuli
dead
and
the
king
of
morocco
sends
up
the
seventy
thousand
dollars
and
they
turn
burdick
harris
loose
and
there
not
half
the
hard
feelings
among
the
nations
about
this
little
kidnapping
matter
as
there
was
about
the
peace
congress
and
burdick
harris
says
to
the
reporters
in
the
greek
language
that
he
often
heard
about
the
united
states
and
he
admires
roosevelt
next
to
raisuli
who
is
one
of
the
whitest
and
most
gentlemanly
kidnappers
that
he
ever
worked
alongside
of
so
you
see
pick
winds
up
caligula
we
got
the
law
of
nations
on
our
side
we
cut
this
colonel
man
out
of
the
herd
and
corral
him
in
them
little
mountains
and
stick
up
his
heirs
and
assigns
for
ten
thousand
dollars
well
you
seldom
little
territorial
terror
i
answers
you
ca
bluff
your
uncle
tecumseh
pickens
i
be
your
company
in
this
graft
but
i
misdoubt
if
you
absorbed
the
inwardness
of
this
burdick
harris
case
calig
and
if
on
any
morning
we
get
a
telegram
from
the
secretary
of
state
asking
about
the
health
of
the
scheme
i
propose
to
acquire
the
most
propinquitous
and
celeritous
mule
in
this
section
and
gallop
diplomatically
over
into
the
neighboring
and
peaceful
nation
of
alabama
iii
me
and
caligula
spent
the
next
three
days
investigating
the
bunch
of
mountains
into
which
we
proposed
to
kidnap
colonel
jackson
rockingham
we
finally
selected
an
upright
slice
of
topography
covered
with
bushes
and
trees
that
you
could
only
reach
by
a
secret
path
that
we
cut
out
up
the
side
of
it
and
the
only
way
to
reach
the
mountain
was
to
follow
up
the
bend
of
a
branch
that
wound
among
the
elevations
then
i
took
in
hand
an
important
subdivision
of
the
proceedings
i
went
up
to
atlanta
on
the
train
and
laid
in
a
supply
of
the
most
gratifying
and
efficient
lines
of
grub
that
money
could
buy
i
always
was
an
admirer
of
viands
in
their
more
palliative
and
revised
stages
hog
and
hominy
are
not
only
inartistic
to
my
stomach
but
they
give
indigestion
to
my
moral
sentiments
and
i
thought
of
colonel
jackson
rockingham
president
of
the
sunrise
edenville
tap
railroad
and
how
he
would
miss
the
luxury
of
his
home
fare
as
is
so
famous
among
wealthy
southerners
so
i
sunk
half
of
mine
and
caligula
capital
in
as
elegant
a
layout
of
fresh
and
canned
provisions
as
burdick
harris
or
any
other
professional
kidnappee
ever
saw
in
a
camp
i
put
another
hundred
in
a
couple
of
cases
of
bordeaux
two
quarts
of
cognac
two
hundred
havana
regalias
with
gold
bands
and
a
camp
stove
and
stools
and
folding
cots
i
wanted
colonel
rockingham
to
be
comfortable
and
i
hoped
after
he
gave
up
the
ten
thousand
dollars
he
would
give
me
and
caligula
as
good
a
name
for
gentlemen
and
entertainers
as
the
greek
man
did
the
friend
of
his
that
made
the
united
states
his
bill
collector
against
africa
when
the
goods
came
down
from
atlanta
we
hired
a
wagon
moved
them
up
on
the
little
mountain
and
established
camp
and
then
we
laid
for
the
colonel
we
caught
him
one
morning
about
two
miles
out
from
mountain
valley
on
his
way
to
look
after
some
of
his
burnt
umber
farm
land
he
was
an
elegant
old
gentleman
as
thin
and
tall
as
a
trout
rod
with
frazzled
and
specs
on
a
black
string
we
explained
to
him
brief
and
easy
what
we
wanted
and
caligula
showed
him
careless
the
handle
of
his
under
his
coat
what
says
colonel
rockingham
bandits
in
perry
county
georgia
i
shall
see
that
the
board
of
immigration
and
public
improvements
hears
of
this
be
so
unfoolhardy
as
to
climb
into
that
buggy
says
caligula
by
order
of
the
board
of
perforation
and
public
depravity
this
is
a
business
meeting
and
we
anxious
to
adjourn
qua
we
drove
colonel
rockingham
over
the
mountain
and
up
the
side
of
it
as
far
as
the
buggy
could
go
then
we
tied
the
horse
and
took
our
prisoner
on
foot
up
to
the
camp
now
colonel
i
says
to
him
we
after
the
ransom
me
and
my
partner
and
no
harm
will
come
to
you
if
the
king
of
mor
if
your
friends
send
up
the
dust
in
the
mean
time
we
are
gentlemen
the
same
as
you
and
if
you
give
us
your
word
not
to
try
to
escape
the
freedom
of
the
camp
is
yours
i
give
you
my
word
says
the
colonel
all
right
says
i
and
now
it
eleven
and
me
and
polk
will
proceed
to
inculcate
the
occasion
with
a
few
trivialities
in
the
way
of
grub
thank
you
says
the
colonel
i
believe
i
could
relish
a
slice
of
bacon
and
a
plate
of
hominy
but
you
wo
says
i
emphatic
not
in
this
camp
we
soar
in
higher
regions
than
them
occupied
by
your
celebrated
but
repulsive
dish
while
the
colonel
read
his
paper
me
and
caligula
took
off
our
coats
and
went
in
for
a
little
luncheon
just
to
show
him
caligula
was
a
fine
cook
of
the
western
brand
he
could
toast
a
buffalo
or
fricassee
a
couple
of
steers
as
easy
as
a
woman
could
make
a
cup
of
tea
he
was
gifted
in
the
way
of
knocking
together
edibles
when
haste
and
muscle
and
quantity
was
to
be
considered
he
held
the
record
west
of
the
arkansas
river
for
frying
pancakes
with
his
left
hand
broiling
venison
cutlets
with
his
right
and
skinning
a
rabbit
with
his
teeth
at
the
same
time
but
i
could
do
things
and
la
and
handle
the
oil
and
tobasco
as
gently
and
nicely
as
a
french
so
at
twelve
we
had
a
hot
lunch
ready
that
looked
like
a
banquet
on
a
mississippi
river
steamboat
we
spread
it
on
the
tops
of
two
or
three
big
boxes
opened
two
quarts
of
the
red
wine
set
the
olives
and
a
canned
oyster
cocktail
and
a
martini
by
the
colonel
plate
and
called
him
to
grub
colonel
rockingham
drew
up
his
campstool
wiped
off
his
specs
and
looked
at
the
things
on
the
table
then
i
thought
he
was
swearing
and
i
felt
mean
because
i
had
taken
more
pains
with
the
victuals
but
he
was
he
was
asking
a
blessing
and
me
and
caligula
hung
our
heads
and
i
saw
a
tear
drop
from
the
colonel
eye
into
his
cocktail
i
never
saw
a
man
eat
with
so
much
earnestness
and
application
not
hastily
like
a
grammarian
or
one
of
the
canal
but
slow
and
appreciative
like
a
anaconda
or
a
real
in
an
hour
and
a
half
the
colonel
leaned
back
i
brought
him
a
pony
of
brandy
and
his
black
coffee
and
set
the
box
of
havana
regalias
on
the
table
gentlemen
says
he
blowing
out
the
smoke
and
trying
to
breathe
it
back
again
when
we
view
the
eternal
hills
and
the
smiling
and
beneficent
landscape
and
reflect
upon
the
goodness
of
the
creator
who
excuse
me
colonel
says
i
but
there
some
business
to
attend
to
now
and
i
brought
out
paper
and
pen
and
ink
and
laid
before
him
who
do
you
want
to
send
to
for
the
money
i
asks
i
reckon
says
he
after
thinking
a
bit
to
the
of
our
railroad
at
the
general
offices
of
the
company
in
edenville
how
far
is
it
to
edenville
from
here
i
asked
about
ten
miles
says
he
then
i
dictated
these
lines
and
colonel
rockingham
wrote
them
out
i
am
kidnapped
and
held
a
prisoner
by
two
desperate
outlaws
in
a
place
which
is
useless
to
attempt
to
find
they
demand
ten
thousand
dollars
at
once
for
my
release
the
amount
must
be
raised
immediately
and
these
directions
followed
come
alone
with
the
money
to
stony
creek
which
runs
out
of
blacktop
mountains
follow
the
bed
of
the
creek
till
you
come
to
a
big
flat
rock
on
the
left
bank
on
which
is
marked
a
cross
in
red
chalk
stand
on
the
rock
and
wave
a
white
flag
a
guide
will
come
to
you
and
conduct
you
to
where
i
am
held
lose
no
time
after
the
colonel
had
finished
this
he
asked
permission
to
take
on
a
postscript
about
how
he
was
being
treated
so
the
railroad
feel
uneasy
in
its
bosom
about
him
we
agreed
to
that
he
wrote
down
that
he
had
just
had
lunch
with
the
two
desperate
ruffians
and
then
he
set
down
the
whole
bill
of
fare
from
cocktails
to
coffee
he
wound
up
with
the
remark
that
dinner
would
be
ready
about
six
and
would
probably
be
a
more
licentious
and
intemperate
affair
than
lunch
me
and
caligula
read
it
and
decided
to
let
it
go
for
we
being
cooks
were
amenable
to
praise
though
it
sounded
out
of
place
on
a
sight
draft
for
ten
thousand
dollars
i
took
the
letter
over
to
the
mountain
valley
road
and
watched
for
a
messenger
by
and
by
a
colored
equestrian
came
along
on
horseback
riding
toward
edenville
i
gave
him
a
dollar
to
take
the
letter
to
the
railroad
offices
and
then
i
went
back
to
camp

about
four
in

like
an
apron
on
a
broomstick

perambulated
down
the
cliff
again
and
escorted
up
a
man
six
foot

with
a
sandy
beard
and
no
other
dimension
that
you
could
notice

myself

the

to
know

coble
i
came
up
to
disseminate
the

our
general
passenger
agent
is
now
negotiating
a
peachcrate
full
of
our
railroad
bonds
with

into
the
lair
a
person
in
blue
overalls
carrying
an
amount
of
inebriety
and
a
lantern
i
am
so
sure
that
this
is
major
tucker
that
i
do
even
ask
him
until
we
are
up
above
and
then
i
discover
that
it
is
uncle
timothy
the
yard
switchman
at
edenville
who
is
sent
ahead
to
flag
our
understandings
with
the
gossip
that
judge
pendergast
the
railroad
attorney
is
in
the
process
of
mortgaging
colonel
rockingham
farming
lands
to
make
up
the
ransom
while
he
is
talking
two
men
crawl
from
under
the
bushes
into
camp
and
caligula
with
no
white
flag
to
disinter
him
from
his
plain
duty
draws
his
gun
but
again
colonel
rockingham
intervenes
and
introduces
jones

and
fireman

says
batts
but
me
and
jim

my
last

down

i
wiping
off
my

if

wants
to
run
an
excursion
up
here
just
because
we
kidnapped
their
president
let
we
put
out
our
sign
kidnapper
cafe
and
trainmen
home
this
time
i
caught
major
tallahassee
tucker
by
his
own
confession
and
i
felt
easier
i
asked
him
into
the
creek
so
i
could
drown
him
if
he
happened
to
be
a
or
caboose
porter
all
the
way
up
the
mountain
he
driveled
to
me
about
asparagus
on
toast
a
thing
that
his
intelligence
in
life
had
skipped
up
above
i
got
his
mind
segregated
from
food
and
asked
if
he
had
raised
the
ransom
my
dear
sir
says
he
i
succeeded
in
negotiating
a
loan
on
thirty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
the
bonds
of
our
railroad
and
never
mind
just
now
major
says
i
it
all
right
then
wait
till
after
dinner
and
we
settle
the
business
all
of
you
gentlemen
i
continues
to
the
crowd
are
invited
to
stay
to
dinner
we
have
mutually
trusted
one
another
and
the
white
flag
is
supposed
to
wave
over
the
proceedings
the
correct
idea
says
caligula
who
was
standing
by
me
two
and
a
dropped
out
of
a
tree
while
you
was
below
the
last
time
did
the
major
man
bring
the
money
he
says
i
answered
that
he
succeeded
in
negotiating
the
loan
if
any
cooks
ever
earned
ten
thousand
dollars
in
twelve
hours
me
and
caligula
did
that
day
at
six
we
spread
the
top
of
the
mountain
with
as
fine
a
dinner
as
the
personnel
of
any
railroad
ever
engulfed
we
opened
all
the
wine
and
we
concocted
entrées
and
de
and
stirred
up
little
savory
de
and
organized
a
mass
of
grub
such
as
has
been
seldom
instigated
out
of
canned
and
bottled
goods
the
railroad
gathered
around
it
and
the
wassail
and
diversions
was
intense
after
the
feast
me
and
caligula
in
the
line
of
business
takes
major
tucker
to
one
side
and
talks
ransom
the
major
pulls
out
an
agglomeration
of
currency
about
the
size
of
the
price
of
a
town
lot
in
the
suburbs
of
rabbitville
arizona
and
makes
this
outcry
gentlemen
says
he
the
stock
of
the
sunrise
edenville
railroad
has
depreciated
some
the
best
i
could
do
with
thirty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
the
bonds
was
to
secure
a
loan
of
dollars
and
fifty
cents
on
the
farming
lands
of
colonel
rockingham
judge
pendergast
was
able
to
obtain
on
a
ninth
mortgage
the
sum
of
fifty
dollars
you
will
find
the
amount
one
hundred
and
fifty
correct
a
railroad
president
said
i
looking
this
tucker
in
the
eye
and
the
owner
of
a
thousand
acres
of
land
and
yet
gentlemen
says
tucker
the
railroad
is
ten
miles
long
there
any
train
run
on
it
except
when
the
crew
goes
out
in
the
pines
and
gathers
enough
lightwood
knots
to
get
up
steam
a
long
time
ago
when
times
was
good
the
net
earnings
used
to
run
as
high
as
eighteen
dollars
a
week
colonel
rockingham
land
has
been
sold
for
taxes
thirteen
times
there
has
been
a
peach
crop
in
this
part
of
georgia
for
two
years
the
wet
spring
killed
the
watermelons
nobody
around
here
has
money
enough
to
buy
fertilizer
and
land
is
so
poor
the
corn
crop
failed
and
there
was
enough
grass
to
support
the
rabbits
all
the
people
have
had
to
eat
in
this
section
for
over
a
year
is
hog
and
hominy
and
pick
interrupts
caligula
mussing
up
his
red
hair
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
that
i
hands
the
money
back
to
major
tucker
and
then
i
goes
over
to
colonel
rockingham
and
slaps
him
on
the
back
colonel
says
i
i
hope
you
enjoyed
our
little
joke
we
want
to
carry
it
too
far
kidnappers
well
would
it
tickle
your
uncle
my
name
rhinegelder
and
i
a
nephew
of
chauncey
depew
my
friend
a
second
cousin
of
the
editor
of
so
you
can
see
we
are
down
south
enjoying
ourselves
in
our
humorous
way
now
two
quarts
of
cognac
to
open
yet
and
then
the
joke
over
what
the
use
to
go
into
details
one
or
two
will
be
enough
i
remember
major
tallahassee
tucker
playing
on
a
and
caligula
waltzing
with
his
head
on
the
watch
pocket
of
a
tall
i
hesitate
to
refer
to
the
done
by
me
and
patterson
coble
with
colonel
jackson
rockingham
between
us
and
even
on
the
next
morning
when
you
would
think
it
possible
there
was
a
consolation
for
me
and
caligula
we
knew
that
raisuli
himself
never
made
half
the
hit
with
burdick
harris
that
we
did
with
the
sunrise
edenville
tap
railroad
the
ethics
of
pig
on
an
train
i
went
into
the
smoker
and
found
jefferson
peters
the
only
man
with
a
brain
west
of
the
wabash
river
who
can
use
his
cerebrum
cerebellum
and
medulla
oblongata
at
the
same
time
jeff
is
in
the
line
of
unillegal
graft
he
is
not
to
be
dreaded
by
widows
and
orphans
he
is
a
reducer
of
surplusage
his
favorite
disguise
is
that
of
the
at
which
the
spendthrift
or
the
reckless
investor
may
shy
a
few
inconsequential
dollars
he
is
readily
vocalized
by
tobacco
so
with
the
aid
of
two
thick
and
brevas
i
got
the
story
of
his
latest
autolycan
adventure
in
my
line
of
business
said
jeff
the
hardest
thing
is
to
find
an
upright
trustworthy
strictly
honorable
partner
to
work
a
graft
with
some
of
the
best
men
i
ever
worked
with
in
a
swindle
would
resort
to
trickery
at
times
so
last
summer
i
thinks
i
will
go
over
into
this
section
of
country
where
i
hear
the
serpent
has
not
yet
entered
and
see
if
i
can
find
a
partner
naturally
gifted
with
a
talent
for
crime
but
not
yet
contaminated
by
success
i
found
a
village
that
seemed
to
show
the
right
kind
of
a
layout
the
inhabitants
had
found
that
adam
had
been
dispossessed
and
were
going
right
along
naming
the
animals
and
killing
snakes
just
as
if
they
were
in
the
garden
of
eden
they
call
this
town
mount
nebo
and
it
up
near
the
spot
where
kentucky
and
west
virginia
and
north
carolina
corner
together
them
states
do
meet
well
it
was
in
that
neighborhood
anyway
after
putting
in
a
week
proving
i
was
a
revenue
officer
i
went
over
to
the
store
where
the
rude
fourflushers
of
the
hamlet
lied
to
see
if
i
could
get
a
line
on
the
kind
of
man
i
wanted
says
i
after
we
had
rubbed
noses
and
gathered
the
barrel
do
suppose
there
another
community
in
the
whole
world
into
which
sin
and
chicanery
has
less
extensively
permeated
than
this
life
here
where
all
the
women
are
brave
and
propitious
and
all
the
men
honest
and
expedient
must
indeed
be
an
idol
it
reminds
me
says
i
goldstein
beautiful
ballad
entitled
the
deserted
village
which
says
fares
the
land
to
hastening
ills
a
prey
what
art
can
drive
its
charms
away
the
judge
rode
slowly
down
the
lane
mother
for
i
to
be
queen
of
the
may
yes
peters
says
the
storekeeper
reckon
we
air
about
as
moral
and
torpid
a
community
as
there
be
on
the
mounting
according
to
censuses
of
opinion
but
i
reckon
you
ai
ever
met
rufe
tatum
no
says
the
town
constable
ca
hardly
have
ever
that
air
rufe
is
shore
the
monstrousest
scalawag
that
has
escaped
on
the
galluses
and
that
puts
me
in
mind
that
i
ought
to
have
turned
rufe
out
of
the
lockup
before
yesterday
the
thirty
days
he
got
for
killin
yance
goodloe
was
up
then
a
day
or
two
more
wo
hurt
rufe
any
though
now
says
i
in
the
mountain
idiom
tell
me
a
man
in
mount
nebo
as
bad
as
that
says
the
storekeeper
steals
hogs
i
think
i
will
look
up
this
tatum
so
a
day
or
two
after
the
constable
turned
him
out
i
got
acquainted
with
him
and
invited
him
out
on
the
edge
of
town
to
sit
on
a
log
and
talk
business
what
i
wanted
was
a
partner
with
a
natural
rural
to
play
a
part
in
some
little
outrages
that
i
was
going
to
book
with
the
pitfall
gin
circuit
in
some
of
the
western
towns
and
this
tatum
was
born
for
the
role
as
sure
as
nature
cast
fairbanks
for
the
stuff
that
kept
from
sinking
into
the
river
he
was
about
the
size
of
a
first
baseman
and
he
had
ambiguous
blue
eyes
like
the
china
dog
on
the
mantelpiece
that
aunt
harriet
used
to
play
with
when
she
was
a
child
his
hair
waved
a
little
bit
like
the
statue
of
the
at
the
vacation
in
rome
but
the
color
of
it
reminded
you
of
the
in
the
grand
canon
by
an
american
artist
that
they
hang
over
the
holes
in
the
salongs
he
was
the
reub
without
needing
a
touch
you
have
known
him
for
one
even
if
you
seen
him
on
the
vaudeville
stage
with
one
cotton
suspender
and
a
straw
over
his
ear
i
told
him
what
i
wanted
and
found
him
ready
to
jump
at
the
job
such
a
trivial
little
peccadillo
as
the
habit
of
manslaughter
says
i
have
you
accomplished
in
the
way
of
indirect
brigandage
or
nonactionable
thriftiness
that
you
could
point
to
with
or
without
pride
as
an
evidence
of
your
qualifications
for
the
position
says
he
in
his
kind
of
southern
system
of
procrastinated
accents
you
heard
tell
there
ai
any
man
black
or
white
in
the
blue
ridge
that
can
tote
off
a
shoat
as
easy
as
i
can
without
bein
heard
seen
or
cotched
i
can
lift
a
shoat
he
goes
on
of
a
pen
from
under
a
porch
at
the
trough
in
the
woods
day
or
night
anywhere
or
anyhow
and
i
guarantee
nobody
wo
hear
a
squeal
it
all
in
the
way
you
grab
hold
of
and
carry
atterwards
some
day
goes
on
this
gentle
despoiler
of
hope
to
become
reckernized
as
the
champion
of
the
world
proper
to
be
ambitious
says
i
will
do
very
well
for
mount
nebo
but
in
the
outside
world
tatum
it
would
be
considered
as
crude
a
piece
of
business
as
a
bear
raid
on
bay
state
gas
however
it
will
do
as
a
guarantee
of
good
faith
we
go
into
partnership
i
got
a
thousand
dollars
cash
capital
and
with
that
atmosphere
of
yours
we
ought
to
be
able
to
win
out
a
few
shares
of
soon
parted
preferred
in
the
money
market
so
i
attaches
rufe
and
we
go
away
from
mount
nebo
down
into
the
lowlands
and
all
the
way
i
coach
him
for
his
part
in
the
grafts
i
had
in
mind
i
had
idled
away
two
months
on
the
florida
coast
and
was
feeling
all
to
the
ponce
de
leon
besides
having
so
many
new
schemes
up
my
sleeve
that
i
had
to
wear
kimonos
to
hold
i
intended
to
assume
a
funnel
shape
and
mow
a
path
nine
miles
wide
though
the
farming
belt
of
the
middle
west
so
we
headed
in
that
direction
but
when
we
got
as
far
as
lexington
we
found
binkley
brothers
circus
there
and
the
peasantry
romping
into
town
and
pounding
the
belgian
blocks
with
their
sabots
as
artless
and
arbitrary
as
an
extra
session
of
a
datto
bryan
drama
i
never
pass
a
circus
without
pulling
the
and
coming
down
for
a
little
key
west
money
so
i
engaged
a
couple
of
rooms
and
board
for
rufe
and
me
at
a
house
near
the
circus
grounds
run
by
a
widow
lady
named
peevy
then
i
took
rufe
to
a
clothing
store
and
him
he
showed
up
strong
as
i
knew
he
would
after
he
was
rigged
up
in
the
rutabaga
regalia
me
and
old
misfitzky
stuffed
him
into
a
bright
blue
suit
with
a
nile
green
visible
plaid
effect
and
riveted
on
a
fancy
vest
of
a
light
tuskegee
normal
tan
color
a
red
necktie
and
the
yellowest
pair
of
shoes
in
town
they
were
the
first
clothes
rufe
had
ever
worn
except
the
gingham
layette
and
the
butternut
of
his
native
kraal
and
he
looked
as
as
an
igorrote
with
a
new
that
night
i
went
down
to
the
circus
tents
and
opened
a
small
shell
game
rufe
was
to
be
the
capper
i
gave
him
a
roll
of
phony
currency
to
bet
with
and
kept
a
bunch
of
it
in
a
special
pocket
to
pay
his
winnings
out
of
no
i
did
mistrust
him
but
i
simply
manipulate
the
ball
to
lose
when
i
see
real
money
bet
my
fingers
go
on
a
strike
every
time
i
try
it
i
set
up
my
little
table
and
began
to
show
them
how
easy
it
was
to
guess
which
shell
the
little
pea
was
under
the
unlettered
hinds
gathered
in
a
thick
semicircle
and
began
to
nudge
elbows
and
banter
one
another
to
bet
then
was
when
rufe
ought
to
have
up
and
called
the
turn
on
the
little
joker
for
a
few
tens
and
fives
to
get
them
started
but
no
rufe
i
seen
him
two
or
three
times
walking
about
and
looking
at
the
pictures
with
his
mouth
full
of
peanut
candy
but
he
never
came
nigh
the
crowd
piked
a
little
but
trying
to
work
the
shells
without
a
capper
is
like
fishing
without
a
bait
i
closed
the
game
with
only
dollars
of
the
unearned
increment
while
i
had
been
counting
on
yanking
the
yeomen
for
two
hundred
at
least
i
went
home
at
eleven
and
went
to
bed
i
supposed
that
the
circus
had
proved
too
alluring
for
rufe
and
that
he
had
succumbed
to
it
concert
and
all
but
i
meant
to
give
him
a
lecture
on
general
business
principles
in
the
morning
just
after
morpheus
had
got
both
my
shoulders
to
the
shuck
mattress
i
hears
a
houseful
of
unbecoming
and
ribald
noises
like
a
youngster
screeching
with
colic
i
opens
my
door
and
calls
out
in
the
hall
for
the
widow
lady
and
when
she
sticks
her
head
out
i
says
peevy
would
you
mind
choking
off
that
kid
of
yours
so
that
honest
people
can
get
their
rest
says
she
no
child
of
mine
it
the
pig
squealing
that
your
friend
tatum
brought
home
to
his
room
a
couple
of
hours
ago
and
if
you
are
uncle
or
second
cousin
or
brother
to
it
i
appreciate
your
stopping
its
mouth
sir
yourself
if
you
please
i
put
on
some
of
the
polite
outside
habiliments
of
external
society
and
went
into
rufe
room
he
had
gotten
up
and
lit
his
lamp
and
was
pouring
some
milk
into
a
tin
pan
on
the
floor
for
a
squealing
pig
is
this
rufe
says
i
flimflammed
in
your
part
of
the
work
and
put
the
game
on
crutches
and
how
do
you
explain
the
pig
it
looks
like
to
me
do
be
too
hard
on
me
jeff
says
he
know
how
long
i
been
used
to
stealing
shoats
it
got
to
be
a
habit
with
me
and
when
i
see
such
a
fine
chance
i
could
help
takin
it
says
i
you
really
got
kleptopigia
and
maybe
when
we
get
out
of
the
pig
belt
you
turn
your
mind
to
higher
and
more
remunerative
misconduct
why
you
should
want
to
stain
your
soul
with
such
a
distasteful
perverted
roaring
beast
as
that
i
ca
understand
jeff
says
he
ai
in
sympathy
with
shoats
you
understand
like
i
do
this
here
seems
to
me
to
be
an
animal
of
more
than
common
powers
of
ration
and
intelligence
he
walked
half
across
the
room
on
his
hind
legs
a
while
ago
i
going
back
to
bed
says
i
if
you
can
impress
it
upon
your
friend
ideas
of
intelligence
that
he
not
to
make
so
much
noise
was
hungry
says
rufe
go
to
sleep
and
keep
quiet
now
i
always
get
up
before
breakfast
and
read
the
morning
paper
whenever
i
happen
to
be
within
the
radius
of
a
hoe
cylinder
or
a
washington
the
next
morning
i
got
up
early
and
found
a
lexington
daily
on
the
front
porch
where
the
carrier
had
thrown
it
the
first
thing
i
saw
in
it
was
a
ad
on
the
front
page
that
read
like
this
five
thousand
dollars
reward
the
above
amount
will
be
paid
and
no
questions
asked
for
the
return
alive
and
uninjured
of

famous
european
educated
pig
that
strayed
or
was
stolen
from
the
tents
of

last
night
geo
tapley
business
manager
at
the
circus
grounds
i
folded
up
the
paper

into
my
inside
pocket
and
went
to
rufe
room
he
was
nearly
dressed
and
was
feeding

of
the

and
some
well
well

on
the
back
called

a
lot
of
names
last
night
says
rufe
well
says
i
looks
better
to
me
this
morning
i
was
raised
on
a
farm
and
i
very
fond
of
pigs
i
used
to
go
to
bed
at
sundown
so
i
never
saw
one
by
lamplight
before
tell
you
what
i
do
rufe
i
says

you
ten
dollars
for
that
pig
reckon
i
would
sell
this
shoat
says
he
it
was
any
other
one
i
might
not
this
one
i
asked
fearful
that
he
might
know
something
because
says
he
was
the
grandest
achievement
of
my
life
there
ai
airy
other
man
that
could
have
done
it
if
i
ever
have
a
fireside
and
children
i
sit
beside
it
and
tell
how
their
daddy
toted
off
a
shoat
from
a
whole
circus
full
of
people
and
maybe
my
grandchildren
too
they
certainly
be
proud
a
whole
passel
why
says
he
was
two
tents
one
openin
into
the
other
this
shoat
was
on
a
platform
tied
with
a
little
chain
i
seen
a
giant
and
a
lady
with
a
fine
chance
of
bushy
white
hair
in
the
other
tent
i
got
the
shoat
and
crawled
out
from
under
the
canvas
again
without
him
squeakin
as
loud
as
a
mouse
i
put
him
under
my
coat
and
i
must
have
passed
a
hundred
folks
before
i
got
out
where
the
streets
was
dark
i
reckon
i
would
sell
that
shoat
jeff
i
want
ma
to
keep
it
so
there
be
a
witness
to
what
i
done
pig
wo
live
long
enough
i
says
use
as
an
exhibit
in
your
senile
fireside
mendacity
your
grandchildren
will
have
to
take
your
word
for
it
i
give
you
one
hundred
dollars
for
the
animal
rufe
looked
at
me
astonished
shoat
ca
be
worth
anything
like
that
to
you
he
says
do
you
want
him
for
me
casuistically
says
i
with
a
rare
smile
think
that
i
got
an
artistic
side
to
my
temper
but
i
have
i
a
collector
of
pigs
i
scoured
the
world
for
unusual
pigs
over
in
the
wabash
valley
i
got
a
hog
ranch
with
most
every
specimen
on
it
from
a
merino
to
a
poland
china
this
looks
like
a
blooded
pig
to
me
rufe
says
i
believe
it
a
genuine
berkshire
that
why
like
to
have
it
shore
like
to
accommodate
you
says
he
i
got
the
artistic
tenement
too
i
do
see
why
it
ai
art
when
you
can
steal
a
shoat
better
than
anybody
else
can
shoats
is
a
kind
of
inspiration
and
genius
with
me
specially
this
one
i
would
take
two
hundred
and
fifty
for
that
animal
listen
says
i
wiping
off
my
forehead
not
so
much
a
matter
of
business
with
me
as
it
is
art
and
not
so
much
art
as
it
is
philanthropy
being
a
connoisseur
and
disseminator
of
pigs
i
feel
like
i
done
my
duty
to
the
world
unless
i
added
that
berkshire
to
my
collection
not
intrinsically
but
according
to
the
ethics
of
pigs
as
friends
and
coadjutors
of
mankind
i
offer
you
five
hundred
dollars
for
the
animal
says
this
pork
esthete
ai
money
it
sentiment
with
me
hundred
says
i
it
eight
hundred
says
rufe
i
crush
the
sentiment
out
of
my
heart
i
went
under
my
clothes
for
my
and
counted
him
out
forty
gold
certificates
just
take
him
into
my
own
room
says
i
lock
him
up
till
after
breakfast
i
took
the
pig
by
the
hind
leg
he
turned
on
a
squeal
like
the
steam
calliope
at
the
circus
me
tote
him
in
for
you
says
rufe
and
he
picks
up
the
beast
under
one
arm
holding
his
snout
with
the
other
hand
and
packs
him
into
my
room
like
a
sleeping
baby
after
breakfast
rufe
who
had
a
chronic
case
of
haberdashery
ever
since
i
got
his
trousseau
says
he
believes
he
will
amble
down
to
misfitzky
and
look
over
some
socks
and
then
i
got
as
busy
as
a
man
with
the
pasting
on
i
found
an
old
negro
man
with
an
express
wagon
to
hire
and
we
tied
the
pig
in
a
sack
and
drove
down
to
the
circus
grounds
i
found
george
tapley
in
a
little
tent
with
a
window
flap
open
he
was
a
fattish
man
with
an
immediate
eye
in
a
black
with
a
diamond
screwed
into
the
bosom
of
his
red
sweater
you
george
b
tapley
i
asks
swear
it
says
he
i
got
it
says
i
says
he
you
the
guinea
pigs
for
the
asiatic
python
or
the
alfalfa
for
the
sacred
buffalo
says
i
got
beppo
the
educated
hog
in
a
sack
in
that
wagon
i
found
him
rooting
up
the
flowers
in
my
front
yard
this
morning
i
take
the
five
thousand
dollars
in
large
bills
if
handy
george
hustles
out
of
his
tent
and
asks
me
to
follow
we
went
into
one
of
the
in
there
was
a
jet
black
pig
with
a
pink
ribbon
around
his
neck
lying
on
some
hay
and
eating
carrots
that
a
man
was
feeding
to
him
mac
calls
b
wrong
with
the
this
morning
is
there
no
says
the
man
got
an
appetite
like
a
chorus
girl
at
you
get
this
pipe
says
tapley
to
me
too
many
pork
chops
last
night
i
pulls
out
the
paper
and
shows
him
the
ad
says
he
know
anything
about
it
you
beheld
with
your
own
eyes
the
marvelous
porcine
wonder
of
the
kingdom
eating
with
preternatural
sagacity
his
matutinal
meal
unstrayed
and
unstole
good
morning
i
was
beginning
to
see
i
got
in
the
wagon
and
told
uncle
ned
to
drive
to
the
most
adjacent
orifice
of
the
nearest
alley
there
i
took
out
my
pig
got
the
range
carefully
for
the
other
opening
set
his
sights
and
gave
him
such
a
kick
that
he
went
out
the
other
end
of
the
alley
twenty
feet
ahead
of
his
squeal
then
i
paid
uncle
ned
his
fifty
cents
and
walked
down
to
the
newspaper
office
i
wanted
to
hear
it
in
cold
syllables
i
got
the
advertising
man
to
his
window
decide
a
bet
says
i
the
man
who
had
this
ad
put
in
last
night
short
and
fat
with
long
black
whiskers
and
a
was
not
says
the
man
would
measure
about
six
feet
by
four
and
a
half
inches
with
hair
and
dressed
like
the
pansies
of
the
conservatory
at
dinner
time
i
went
back
to
peevy
i
keep
some
soup
hot
for
tatum
till
he
comes
back
she
asks
you
do
says
i
more
than
exhaust
for
firewood
all
the
coal
in
the
bosom
of
the
earth
and
all
the
forests
on
the
outside
of
it
so
there
you
see
said
jefferson
peters
in
conclusion
how
hard
it
is
ever
to
find
a
and
honest
but
i
began
with
the
freedom
of
long
acquaintance
the
rule
should
work
both
ways
if
you
had
offered
to
divide
the
reward
you
would
not
have
lost
jeff
look
of
dignified
reproach
stopped
me
that
do
involve
the
same
principles
at
all
said
he
mine
was
a
legitimate
and
moral
attempt
at
speculation
buy
low
and
sell
high
do
wall
street
endorse
it
bulls
and
bears
and
pigs
what
the
difference
why
not
bristles
as
well
as
horns
and
fur
