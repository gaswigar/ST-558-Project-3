the
art
of
money
getting
or
golden
rules
for
making
money
by
barnum
in
the
united
states
where
we
have
more
land
than
people
it
is
not
at
all
difficult
for
persons
in
good
health
to
make
money
in
this
comparatively
new
field
there
are
so
many
avenues
of
success
open
so
many
vocations
which
are
not
crowded
that
any
person
of
either
sex
who
is
willing
at
least
for
the
time
being
to
engage
in
any
respectable
occupation
that
offers
may
find
lucrative
employment
those
who
really
desire
to
attain
an
independence
have
only
to
set
their
minds
upon
it
and
adopt
the
proper
means
as
they
do
in
regard
to
any
other
object
which
they
wish
to
accomplish
and
the
thing
is
easily
done
but
however
easy
it
may
be
found
to
make
money
i
have
no
doubt
many
of
my
hearers
will
agree
it
is
the
most
difficult
thing
in
the
world
to
keep
it
the
road
to
wealth
is
as
franklin
truly
says
as
plain
as
the
road
to
the
mill
it
consists
simply
in
expending
less
than
we
earn
that
seems
to
be
a
very
simple
problem
micawber
one
of
those
happy
creations
of
the
genial
dickens
puts
the
case
in
a
strong
light
when
he
says
that
to
have
annual
income
of
twenty
pounds
per
annum
and
spend
twenty
pounds
and
sixpence
is
to
be
the
most
miserable
of
men
whereas
to
have
an
income
of
only
twenty
pounds
and
spend
but
nineteen
pounds
and
sixpence
is
to
be
the
happiest
of
mortals
many
of
my
readers
may
say
we
understand
this
this
is
economy
and
we
know
economy
is
wealth
we
know
we
ca
eat
our
cake
and
keep
it
also
yet
i
beg
to
say
that
perhaps
more
cases
of
failure
arise
from
mistakes
on
this
point
than
almost
any
other
the
fact
is
many
people
think
they
understand
economy
when
they
really
do
not
true
economy
is
misapprehended
and
people
go
through
life
without
properly
comprehending
what
that
principle
is
one
says
i
have
an
income
of
so
much
and
here
is
my
neighbor
who
has
the
same
yet
every
year
he
gets
something
ahead
and
i
fall
short
why
is
it
i
know
all
about
economy
he
thinks
he
does
but
he
does
not
there
are
men
who
think
that
economy
consists
in
saving
and
in
cutting
off
two
pence
from
the
laundress
bill
and
doing
all
sorts
of
little
mean
dirty
things
economy
is
not
meanness
the
misfortune
is
also
that
this
class
of
persons
let
their
economy
apply
in
only
one
direction
they
fancy
they
are
so
wonderfully
economical
in
saving
a
where
they
ought
to
spend
twopence
that
they
think
they
can
afford
to
squander
in
other
directions
a
few
years
ago
before
kerosene
oil
was
discovered
or
thought
of
one
might
stop
overnight
at
almost
any
farmer
house
in
the
agricultural
districts
and
get
a
very
good
supper
but
after
supper
he
might
attempt
to
read
in
the
and
would
find
it
impossible
with
the
inefficient
light
of
one
candle
the
hostess
seeing
his
dilemma
would
say
it
is
rather
difficult
to
read
here
evenings
the
proverb
says
must
have
a
ship
at
sea
in
order
to
be
able
to
burn
two
candles
at
once
we
never
have
an
extra
candle
except
on
extra
occasions
these
extra
occasions
occur
perhaps
twice
a
year
in
this
way
the
good
woman
saves
five
six
or
ten
dollars
in
that
time
but
the
information
which
might
be
derived
from
having
the
extra
light
would
of
course
far
outweigh
a
ton
of
candles
but
the
trouble
does
not
end
here
feeling
that
she
is
so
economical
in
tallow
candies
she
thinks
she
can
afford
to
go
frequently
to
the
village
and
spend
twenty
or
thirty
dollars
for
ribbons
and
furbelows
many
of
which
are
not
necessary
this
false
connote
may
frequently
be
seen
in
men
of
business
and
in
those
instances
it
often
runs
to
you
find
good
businessmen
who
save
all
the
old
envelopes
and
scraps
and
would
not
tear
a
new
sheet
of
paper
if
they
could
avoid
it
for
the
world
this
is
all
very
well
they
may
in
this
way
save
five
or
ten
dollars
a
year
but
being
so
economical
only
in
note
paper
they
think
they
can
afford
to
waste
time
to
have
expensive
parties
and
to
drive
their
carriages
this
is
an
illustration
of
saving
at
the
spigot
and
wasting
at
the
penny
wise
and
pound
foolish
punch
in
speaking
of
this
one
idea
class
of
people
says
they
are
like
the
man
who
bought
a
penny
herring
for
his
dinner
and
then
hired
a
coach
and
four
to
take
it
home
i
never
knew
a
man
to
succeed
by
practising
this
kind
of
economy
true
economy
consists
in
always
making
the
income
exceed
the
wear
the
old
clothes
a
little
longer
if
necessary
dispense
with
the
new
pair
of
gloves
mend
the
old
dress
live
on
plainer
food
if
need
be
so
that
under
all
circumstances
unless
some
unforeseen
accident
occurs
there
will
be
a
margin
in
favor
of
the
income
a
penny
here
and
a
dollar
there
placed
at
interest
goes
on
accumulating
and
in
this
way
the
desired
result
is
attained
it
requires
some
training
perhaps
to
accomplish
this
economy
but
when
once
used
to
it
you
will
find
there
is
more
satisfaction
in
rational
saving
than
in
irrational
spending
here
is
a
recipe
which
i
recommend
i
have
found
it
to
work
an
excellent
cure
for
extravagance
and
especially
for
mistaken
economy
when
you
find
that
you
have
no
surplus
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
yet
have
a
good
income
i
advise
you
to
take
a
few
sheets
of
paper
and
form
them
into
a
book
and
mark
down
every
item
of
expenditure
post
it
every
day
or
week
in
two
columns
one
headed
necessaries
or
even
comforts
and
the
other
headed
luxuries
and
you
will
find
that
the
latter
column
will
be
double
treble
and
frequently
ten
times
greater
than
the
former
the
real
comforts
of
life
cost
but
a
small
portion
of
what
most
of
us
can
earn
franklin
says
it
is
the
eyes
of
others
and
not
our
own
eyes
which
ruin
us
if
all
the
world
were
blind
except
myself
i
should
not
care
for
fine
clothes
or
furniture
it
is
the
fear
of
what
grundy
may
say
that
keeps
the
noses
of
many
worthy
families
to
the
grindstone
in
america
many
persons
like
to
repeat
we
are
all
free
and
equal
but
it
is
a
great
mistake
in
more
senses
than
one
that
we
are
born
free
and
equal
is
a
glorious
truth
in
one
sense
yet
we
are
not
all
born
equally
rich
and
we
never
shall
be
one
may
say
there
is
a
man
who
has
an
income
of
fifty
thousand
dollars
per
annum
while
i
have
but
one
thousand
dollars
i
knew
that
fellow
when
he
was
poor
like
myself
now
he
is
rich
and
thinks
he
is
better
than
i
am
i
will
show
him
that
i
am
as
good
as
he
is
i
will
go
and
buy
a
horse
and
buggy
no
i
can
not
do
that
but
i
will
go
and
hire
one
and
ride
this
afternoon
on
the
same
road
that
he
does
and
thus
prove
to
him
that
i
am
as
good
as
he
is
my
friend
you
need
not
take
that
trouble
you
can
easily
prove
that
you
are
as
good
as
he
is
you
have
only
to
behave
as
well
as
he
does
but
you
can
not
make
anybody
believe
that
you
are
rich
as
he
is
besides
if
you
put
on
these
airs
add
waste
your
time
and
spend
your
money
your
poor
wife
will
be
obliged
to
scrub
her
fingers
off
at
home
and
buy
her
tea
two
ounces
at
a
time
and
everything
else
in
proportion
in
order
that
you
may
keep
up
appearances
and
after
all
deceive
nobody
on
the
other
hand
smith
may
say
that
her
neighbor
married
johnson
for
his
money
and
everybody
says
so
she
has
a
nice
dollar
camel
hair
shawl
and
she
will
make
smith
get
her
an
imitation
one
and
she
will
sit
in
a
pew
right
next
to
her
neighbor
in
church
in
order
to
prove
that
she
is
her
equal
my
good
woman
you
will
not
get
ahead
in
the
world
if
your
vanity
and
envy
thus
take
the
lead
in
this
country
where
we
believe
the
majority
ought
to
rule
we
ignore
that
principle
in
regard
to
fashion
and
let
a
handful
of
people
calling
themselves
the
aristocracy
run
up
a
false
standard
of
perfection
and
in
endeavoring
to
rise
to
that
standard
we
constantly
keep
ourselves
poor
all
the
time
digging
away
for
the
sake
of
outside
appearances
how
much
wiser
to
be
a
law
unto
ourselves
and
say
we
will
regulate
our
by
our
income
and
lay
up
something
for
a
rainy
day
people
ought
to
be
as
sensible
on
the
subject
of
as
on
any
other
subject
like
causes
produces
like
effects
you
can
not
accumulate
a
fortune
by
taking
the
road
that
leads
to
poverty
it
needs
no
prophet
to
tell
us
that
those
who
live
fully
up
to
their
means
without
any
thought
of
a
reverse
in
this
life
can
never
attain
a
pecuniary
independence
men
and
women
accustomed
to
gratify
every
whim
and
caprice
will
find
it
hard
at
first
to
cut
down
their
various
unnecessary
expenses
and
will
feel
it
a
great
to
live
in
a
smaller
house
than
they
have
been
accustomed
to
with
less
expensive
furniture
less
company
less
costly
clothing
fewer
servants
a
less
number
of
balls
parties
pleasure
excursions
and
other
extravagances
but
after
all
if
they
will
try
the
plan
of
laying
by
a
or
in
other
words
a
small
sum
of
money
at
interest
or
judiciously
invested
in
land
they
will
be
surprised
at
the
pleasure
to
be
derived
from
constantly
adding
to
their
little
pile
as
well
as
from
all
the
economical
habits
which
are
engendered
by
this
course
the
old
suit
of
clothes
and
the
old
bonnet
and
dress
will
answer
for
another
season
the
croton
or
spring
water
taste
better
than
champagne
a
cold
bath
and
a
brisk
walk
will
prove
more
exhilarating
than
a
ride
in
the
finest
coach
a
social
chat
an
evening
reading
in
the
family
circle
or
an
hour
play
of
hunt
the
slipper
and
blind
man
buff
will
be
far
more
pleasant
than
a
fifty
or
five
hundred
dollar
party
when
the
reflection
on
the
difference
in
cost
is
indulged
in
by
those
who
begin
to
know
the
pleasures
of
saving
thousands
of
men
are
kept
poor
and
tens
of
thousands
are
made
so
after
they
have
acquired
quite
sufficient
to
support
them
well
through
life
in
consequence
of
laying
their
plans
of
living
on
too
broad
a
platform
some
families
expend
twenty
thousand
dollars
per
annum
and
some
much
more
and
would
scarcely
know
how
to
live
on
less
while
others
secure
more
solid
enjoyment
frequently
on
a
twentieth
part
of
that
amount
prosperity
is
a
more
severe
ordeal
than
adversity
especially
sudden
prosperity
easy
come
easy
go
is
an
old
and
true
proverb
a
spirit
of
pride
and
vanity
when
permitted
to
have
full
sway
is
the
undying
which
gnaws
the
very
vitals
of
a
man
worldly
possessions
let
them
be
small
or
great
hundreds
or
millions
many
persons
as
they
begin
to
prosper
immediately
expand
their
ideas
and
commence
expending
for
luxuries
until
in
a
short
time
their
expenses
swallow
up
their
income
and
they
become
ruined
in
their
ridiculous
attempts
to
keep
up
appearances
and
make
a
sensation
i
know
a
gentleman
of
fortune
who
says
that
when
he
first
began
to
prosper
his
wife
would
have
a
new
and
elegant
sofa
that
sofa
he
says
cost
me
thirty
thousand
dollars
when
the
sofa
reached
the
house
it
was
found
necessary
to
get
chairs
to
match
then
carpets
and
tables
to
correspond
with
them
and
so
on
through
the
entire
stock
of
furniture
when
at
last
it
was
found
that
the
house
itself
was
quite
too
small
and
for
the
furniture
and
a
new
one
was
built
to
correspond
with
the
new
purchases
thus
added
my
friend
summing
up
an
outlay
of
thirty
thousand
dollars
caused
by
that
single
sofa
and
saddling
on
me
in
the
shape
of
servants
equipage
and
the
necessary
expenses
attendant
upon
keeping
up
a
fine
a
yearly
outlay
of
eleven
thousand
dollars
and
a
tight
pinch
at
that
whereas
ten
years
ago
we
lived
with
much
more
real
comfort
because
with
much
less
care
on
as
many
hundreds
the
truth
is
he
continued
that
sofa
would
have
brought
me
to
inevitable
bankruptcy
had
not
a
most
unexampled
title
to
prosperity
kept
me
above
it
and
had
i
not
checked
the
natural
desire
to
a
dash
the
foundation
of
success
in
life
is
good
health
that
is
the
substratum
fortune
it
is
also
the
basis
of
happiness
a
person
can
not
accumulate
a
fortune
very
well
when
he
is
sick
he
has
no
ambition
no
incentive
no
force
of
course
there
are
those
who
have
bad
health
and
can
not
help
it
you
can
not
expect
that
such
persons
can
accumulate
wealth
but
there
are
a
great
many
in
poor
health
who
need
not
be
so
if
then
sound
health
is
the
foundation
of
success
and
happiness
in
life
how
important
it
is
that
we
should
study
the
laws
of
health
which
is
but
another
expression
for
the
laws
of
nature
the
nearer
we
keep
to
the
laws
of
nature
the
nearer
we
are
to
good
health
and
yet
how
many
persons
there
are
who
pay
no
attention
to
natural
laws
but
absolutely
transgress
them
even
against
their
own
natural
inclination
we
ought
to
know
that
the
sin
of
ignorance
is
never
winked
at
in
regard
to
the
violation
of
nature
laws
their
infraction
always
brings
the
penalty
a
child
may
thrust
its
finger
into
the
flames
without
knowing
it
will
burn
and
so
suffers
repentance
even
will
not
stop
the
smart
many
of
our
ancestors
knew
very
little
about
the
principle
of
ventilation
they
did
not
know
much
about
oxygen
whatever
other
gin
they
might
have
been
acquainted
with
and
consequently
they
built
their
houses
with
little
feet
bedrooms
and
these
good
old
pious
puritans
would
lock
themselves
up
in
one
of
these
cells
say
their
prayers
and
go
to
bed
in
the
morning
they
would
devoutly
return
thanks
for
the
preservation
of
their
lives
during
the
night
and
nobody
had
better
reason
to
be
thankful
probably
some
big
crack
in
the
window
or
in
the
door
let
in
a
little
fresh
air
and
thus
saved
them
many
persons
knowingly
violate
the
laws
of
nature
against
their
better
impulses
for
the
sake
of
fashion
for
instance
there
is
one
thing
that
nothing
living
except
a
vile
worm
ever
naturally
loved
and
that
is
tobacco
yet
how
many
persons
there
are
who
deliberately
train
an
unnatural
appetite
and
overcome
this
implanted
aversion
for
tobacco
to
such
a
degree
that
they
get
to
love
it
they
have
got
hold
of
a
poisonous
filthy
weed
or
rather
that
takes
a
firm
hold
of
them
here
are
married
men
who
run
about
spitting
tobacco
juice
on
the
carpet
and
floors
and
sometimes
even
upon
their
wives
besides
they
do
not
kick
their
wives
out
of
doors
like
drunken
men
but
their
wives
i
have
no
doubt
often
wish
they
were
outside
of
the
house
another
perilous
feature
is
that
this
artificial
appetite
like
jealousy
grows
by
what
it
feeds
on
when
you
love
that
which
is
unnatural
a
stronger
appetite
is
created
for
the
hurtful
thing
than
the
natural
desire
for
what
is
harmless
there
is
an
old
proverb
which
says
that
habit
is
second
nature
but
an
artificial
habit
is
stronger
than
nature
take
for
instance
an
old
his
love
for
the
quid
is
stronger
than
his
love
for
any
particular
kind
of
food
he
can
give
up
roast
beef
easier
than
give
up
the
weed
young
lads
regret
that
they
are
not
men
they
would
like
to
go
to
bed
boys
and
wake
up
men
and
to
accomplish
this
they
copy
the
bad
habits
of
their
seniors
little
tommy
and
johnny
see
their
fathers
or
uncles
smoke
a
pipe
and
they
say
if
i
could
only
do
that
i
would
be
a
man
too
uncle
john
has
gone
out
and
left
his
pipe
of
tobacco
let
us
try
it
they
take
a
match
and
light
it
and
then
puff
away
we
will
learn
to
smoke
do
you
like
it
johnny
that
lad
dolefully
replies
not
very
much
it
tastes
bitter
by
and
by
he
grows
pale
but
he
persists
and
he
soon
offers
up
a
sacrifice
on
the
altar
of
fashion
but
the
boys
stick
to
it
and
persevere
until
at
last
they
conquer
their
natural
appetites
and
become
the
victims
of
acquired
tastes
i
speak
by
the
book
for
i
have
noticed
its
effects
on
myself
having
gone
so
far
as
to
smoke
ten
or
fifteen
cigars
a
day
although
i
have
not
used
the
weed
during
the
last
fourteen
years
and
never
shall
again
the
more
a
man
smokes
the
more
he
craves
smoking
the
last
cigar
smoked
simply
excites
the
desire
for
another
and
so
on
incessantly
take
the
in
the
morning
when
he
gets
up
he
puts
a
quid
in
his
mouth
and
keeps
it
there
all
day
never
taking
it
out
except
to
exchange
it
for
a
fresh
one
or
when
he
is
going
to
eat
oh
yes
at
intervals
during
the
day
and
evening
many
a
chewer
takes
out
the
quid
and
holds
it
in
his
hand
long
enough
to
take
a
drink
and
then
pop
it
goes
back
again
this
simply
proves
that
the
appetite
for
rum
is
even
stronger
than
that
for
tobacco
when
the
goes
to
your
country
seat
and
you
show
him
your
grapery
and
fruit
house
and
the
beauties
of
your
garden
when
you
offer
him
some
fresh
ripe
fruit
and
say
my
friend
i
have
got
here
the
most
delicious
apples
and
pears
and
peaches
and
apricots
i
have
imported
them
from
spain
france
and
italy
just
see
those
luscious
grapes
there
is
nothing
more
delicious
nor
more
healthy
than
ripe
fruit
so
help
yourself
i
want
to
see
you
delight
yourself
with
these
things
he
will
roll
the
dear
quid
under
his
tongue
and
answer
no
i
thank
you
i
have
got
tobacco
in
my
mouth
his
palate
has
become
narcotized
by
the
noxious
weed
and
he
has
lost
in
a
great
measure
the
delicate
and
enviable
taste
for
fruits
this
shows
what
expensive
useless
and
injurious
habits
men
will
get
into
i
speak
from
experience
i
have
smoked
until
i
trembled
like
an
aspen
leaf
the
blood
rushed
to
my
head
and
i
had
a
palpitation
of
the
heart
which
i
thought
was
heart
disease
till
i
was
almost
killed
with
fright
when
i
consulted
my
physician
he
said
break
off
tobacco
using
i
was
not
only
injuring
my
health
and
spending
a
great
deal
of
money
but
i
was
setting
a
bad
example
i
obeyed
his
counsel
no
young
man
in
the
world
ever
looked
so
beautiful
as
he
thought
he
did
behind
a
fifteen
cent
cigar
or
a
meerschaum
these
remarks
apply
with
tenfold
force
to
the
use
of
intoxicating
drinks
to
make
money
requires
a
clear
brain
a
man
has
got
to
see
that
two
and
two
make
four
he
must
lay
all
his
plans
with
reflection
and
forethought
and
closely
examine
all
the
details
and
the
ins
and
outs
of
business
as
no
man
can
succeed
in
business
unless
he
has
a
brain
to
enable
him
to
lay
his
plans
and
reason
to
guide
him
in
their
execution
so
no
matter
how
bountifully
a
man
may
be
blessed
with
intelligence
if
the
brain
is
muddled
and
his
judgment
warped
by
intoxicating
drinks
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
carry
on
business
successfully
how
many
good
opportunities
have
passed
never
to
return
while
a
man
was
sipping
a
social
glass
with
his
friend
how
many
foolish
bargains
have
been
made
under
the
influence
of
the
nervine
which
temporarily
makes
its
victim
think
he
is
rich
how
many
important
chances
have
been
put
off
until
and
then
forever
because
the
wine
cup
has
thrown
the
system
into
a
state
of
lassitude
neutralizing
the
energies
so
essential
to
success
in
business
verily
wine
is
a
mocker
the
use
of
intoxicating
drinks
as
a
beverage
is
as
much
an
infatuation
as
is
the
smoking
of
opium
by
the
chinese
and
the
former
is
quite
as
destructive
to
the
success
of
the
business
man
as
the
latter
it
is
an
unmitigated
evil
utterly
indefensible
in
the
light
of
philosophy
religion
or
good
sense
it
is
the
parent
of
nearly
every
other
evil
in
our
country
do
mistake
your
vocation
the
safest
plan
and
the
one
most
sure
of
success
for
the
young
man
starting
in
life
is
to
select
the
vocation
which
is
most
congenial
to
his
tastes
parents
and
guardians
are
often
quite
too
negligent
in
regard
to
this
it
very
common
for
a
father
to
say
for
example
i
have
five
boys
i
will
make
billy
a
clergyman
john
a
lawyer
tom
a
doctor
and
dick
a
farmer
he
then
goes
into
town
and
looks
about
to
see
what
he
will
do
with
sammy
he
returns
home
and
says
sammy
i
see
is
a
nice
genteel
business
i
think
i
will
make
you
a
goldsmith
he
does
this
regardless
of
sam
natural
inclinations
or
genius
we
are
all
no
doubt
born
for
a
wise
purpose
there
is
as
much
diversity
in
our
brains
as
in
our
countenances
some
are
born
natural
mechanics
while
some
have
great
aversion
to
machinery
let
a
dozen
boys
of
ten
years
get
together
and
you
will
soon
observe
two
or
three
are
whittling
out
some
ingenious
device
working
with
locks
or
complicated
machinery
when
they
were
but
five
years
old
their
father
could
find
no
toy
to
please
them
like
a
puzzle
they
are
natural
mechanics
but
the
other
eight
or
nine
boys
have
different
aptitudes
i
belong
to
the
latter
class
i
never
had
the
slightest
love
for
mechanism
on
the
contrary
i
have
a
sort
of
abhorrence
for
complicated
machinery
i
never
had
ingenuity
enough
to
whittle
a
cider
tap
so
it
would
not
leak
i
never
could
make
a
pen
that
i
could
write
with
or
understand
the
principle
of
a
steam
engine
if
a
man
was
to
take
such
a
boy
as
i
was
and
attempt
to
make
a
watchmaker
of
him
the
boy
might
after
an
apprenticeship
of
five
or
seven
years
be
able
to
take
apart
and
put
together
a
watch
but
all
through
life
he
would
be
working
up
hill
and
seizing
every
excuse
for
leaving
his
work
and
idling
away
his
time
watchmaking
is
repulsive
to
him
unless
a
man
enters
upon
the
vocation
intended
for
him
by
nature
and
best
suited
to
his
peculiar
genius
he
can
not
succeed
i
am
glad
to
believe
that
the
majority
of
persons
do
find
their
right
vocation
yet
we
see
many
who
have
mistaken
their
calling
from
the
blacksmith
up
or
down
to
the
clergyman
you
will
see
for
instance
that
extraordinary
linguist
the
learned
blacksmith
who
ought
to
have
been
a
teacher
of
languages
and
you
may
have
seen
lawyers
doctors
and
clergymen
who
were
better
fitted
by
nature
for
the
anvil
or
the
lapstone
select
the
right
location
after
securing
the
right
vocation
you
must
be
careful
to
select
the
proper
location
you
may
have
been
cut
out
for
a
hotel
keeper
and
they
say
it
requires
a
genius
to
know
how
to
keep
a
hotel
you
might
conduct
a
hotel
like
and
provide
satisfactorily
for
five
hundred
guests
every
day
yet
if
you
should
locate
your
house
in
a
small
village
where
there
is
no
railroad
communication
or
public
travel
the
location
would
be
your
ruin
it
is
equally
important
that
you
do
not
commence
business
where
there
are
already
enough
to
meet
all
demands
in
the
same
occupation
i
remember
a
case
which
illustrates
this
subject
when
i
was
in
london
in
i
was
passing
down
holborn
with
an
english
friend
and
came
to
the
penny
shows
they
had
immense
cartoons
outside
portraying
the
wonderful
curiosities
to
be
seen
all
for
a
penny
being
a
little
in
the
show
line
myself
i
said
let
us
go
in
here
we
soon
found
ourselves
in
the
presence
of
the
illustrious
showman
and
he
proved
to
be
the
sharpest
man
in
that
line
i
had
ever
met
he
told
us
some
extraordinary
stories
in
reference
to
his
bearded
ladies
his
albinos
and
his
armadillos
which
we
could
hardly
believe
but
thought
it
better
to
believe
it
than
look
after
the
proof
he
finally
begged
to
call
our
attention
to
some
wax
statuary
and
showed
us
a
lot
of
the
dirtiest
and
filthiest
wax
figures
imaginable
they
looked
as
if
they
had
not
seen
water
since
the
deluge
what
is
there
so
wonderful
about
your
statuary
i
asked
i
beg
you
not
to
speak
so
satirically
he
replied
sir
these
are
not
madam
tussaud
wax
figures
all
covered
with
gilt
and
tinsel
and
imitation
diamonds
and
copied
from
engravings
and
photographs
mine
sir
were
taken
from
life
whenever
you
look
upon
one
of
those
figures
you
may
consider
that
you
are
looking
upon
the
living
individual
glancing
casually
at
them
i
saw
one
labeled
henry
viii
and
feeling
a
little
curious
upon
seeing
that
it
looked
like
calvin
edson
the
living
skeleton
i
said
do
you
call
that
the
eighth
he
replied
certainly
sir
it
was
taken
from
life
at
hampton
court
by
special
order
of
his
majesty
on
such
a
day
he
would
have
given
the
hour
of
the
day
if
i
had
resisted
i
said
everybody
knows
that
viii
was
a
great
stout
old
king
and
that
figure
is
lean
and
lank
what
do
you
say
to
that
why
he
replied
you
would
be
lean
and
lank
yourself
if
you
sat
there
as
long
as
he
has
there
was
no
resisting
such
arguments
i
said
to
my
english
friend
let
us
go
out
do
not
tell
him
who
i
am
i
show
the
white
feather
he
beats
me
he
followed
us
to
the
door
and
seeing
the
rabble
in
the
street
he
called
out
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
beg
to
draw
your
attention
to
the
respectable
character
of
my
visitors
pointing
to
us
as
we
walked
away
i
called
upon
him
a
couple
of
days
afterwards
told
him
who
i
was
and
said
my
friend
you
are
an
excellent
showman
but
you
have
selected
a
bad
location
he
replied
this
is
true
sir
i
feel
that
all
my
talents
are
thrown
away
but
what
can
i
do
you
can
go
to
america
i
replied
you
can
give
full
play
to
your
faculties
over
there
you
will
find
plenty
of
elbowroom
in
america
i
will
engage
you
for
two
years
after
that
you
will
be
able
to
go
on
your
own
account
he
accepted
my
offer
and
remained
two
years
in
my
new
york
museum
he
then
went
to
new
orleans
and
carried
on
a
traveling
show
business
during
the
summer
he
is
worth
sixty
thousand
dollars
simply
because
he
selected
the
right
vocation
and
also
secured
the
proper
location
the
old
proverb
says
three
removes
are
as
bad
as
a
fire
but
when
a
man
is
in
the
fire
it
matters
but
little
how
soon
or
how
often
he
removes
avoid
debt
young
men
starting
in
life
should
avoid
running
into
debt
there
is
scarcely
anything
that
drags
a
person
down
like
debt
it
is
a
slavish
position
to
get
in
yet
we
find
many
a
young
man
hardly
out
of
his
teens
running
in
debt
he
meets
a
chum
and
says
look
at
this
i
have
got
trusted
for
a
new
suit
of
clothes
he
seems
to
look
upon
the
clothes
as
so
much
given
to
him
well
it
frequently
is
so
but
if
he
succeeds
in
paying
and
then
gets
trusted
again
he
is
adopting
a
habit
which
will
keep
him
in
poverty
through
life
debt
robs
a
man
of
his
and
makes
him
almost
despise
himself
grunting
and
groaning
and
working
for
what
he
has
eaten
up
or
worn
out
and
now
when
he
is
called
upon
to
pay
up
he
has
nothing
to
show
for
his
money
this
is
properly
termed
working
for
a
dead
horse
i
do
not
speak
of
merchants
buying
and
selling
on
credit
or
of
those
who
buy
on
credit
in
order
to
turn
the
purchase
to
a
profit
the
old
quaker
said
to
his
farmer
son
john
never
get
trusted
but
if
thee
gets
trusted
for
anything
let
it
be
for
because
that
will
help
thee
pay
it
back
again
beecher
advised
young
men
to
get
in
debt
if
they
could
to
a
small
amount
in
the
purchase
of
land
in
the
country
districts
if
a
young
man
he
says
will
only
get
in
debt
for
some
land
and
then
get
married
these
two
things
will
keep
him
straight
or
nothing
will
this
may
be
safe
to
a
limited
extent
but
getting
in
debt
for
what
you
eat
and
drink
and
wear
is
to
be
avoided
some
families
have
a
foolish
habit
of
getting
credit
at
the
stores
and
thus
frequently
purchase
many
things
which
might
have
been
dispensed
with
it
is
all
very
well
to
say
i
have
got
trusted
for
sixty
days
and
if
i
do
have
the
money
the
creditor
will
think
nothing
about
it
there
is
no
class
of
people
in
the
world
who
have
such
good
memories
as
creditors
when
the
sixty
days
run
out
you
will
have
to
pay
if
you
do
not
pay
you
will
break
your
promise
and
probably
resort
to
a
falsehood
you
may
make
some
excuse
or
get
in
debt
elsewhere
to
pay
it
but
that
only
involves
you
the
deeper
a
lazy
young
fellow
was
the
apprentice
boy
horatio
his
employer
said
horatio
did
you
ever
see
a
snail
i
think
i
have
he
drawled
out
you
must
have
met
him
then
for
i
am
sure
you
never
overtook
one
said
the
boss
your
creditor
will
meet
you
or
overtake
you
and
say
now
my
young
friend
you
agreed
to
pay
me
you
have
not
done
it
you
must
give
me
your
note
you
give
the
note
on
interest
and
it
commences
working
against
you
it
is
a
dead
horse
the
creditor
goes
to
bed
at
night
and
wakes
up
in
the
morning
better
off
than
when
he
retired
to
bed
because
his
interest
has
increased
during
the
night
but
you
grow
poorer
while
you
are
sleeping
for
the
interest
is
accumulating
against
you
money
is
in
some
respects
like
fire
it
is
a
very
excellent
servant
but
a
terrible
master
when
you
have
it
mastering
you
when
interest
is
constantly
piling
up
against
you
it
will
keep
you
down
in
the
worst
kind
of
slavery
but
let
money
work
for
you
and
you
have
the
most
devoted
servant
in
the
world
it
is
no
there
is
nothing
animate
or
inanimate
that
will
work
so
faithfully
as
money
when
placed
at
interest
well
secured
it
works
night
and
day
and
in
wet
or
dry
weather
i
was
born
in
the
state
of
connecticut
where
the
old
puritans
had
laws
so
rigid
that
it
was
said
they
fined
a
man
for
kissing
his
wife
on
sunday
yet
these
rich
old
puritans
would
have
thousands
of
dollars
at
interest
and
on
saturday
night
would
be
worth
a
certain
amount
on
sunday
they
would
go
to
church
and
perform
all
the
duties
of
a
christian
on
waking
up
on
monday
morning
they
would
find
themselves
considerably
richer
than
the
saturday
night
previous
simply
because
their
money
placed
at
interest
had
worked
faithfully
for
them
all
day
sunday
according
to
law
do
not
let
it
work
against
you
if
you
do
there
is
no
chance
for
success
in
life
so
far
as
money
is
concerned
john
randolph
the
eccentric
virginian
once
exclaimed
in
congress
speaker
i
have
discovered
the
philosopher
stone
pay
as
you
go
this
is
indeed
nearer
to
the
philosopher
stone
than
any
alchemist
has
ever
yet
arrived
persevere
when
a
man
is
in
the
right
path
he
must
persevere
i
speak
of
this
because
there
are
some
persons
who
are
born
tired
naturally
lazy
and
possessing
no
and
no
perseverance
but
they
can
cultivate
these
qualities
as
davy
crockett
said
this
thing
remember
when
i
am
dead
be
sure
you
are
right
then
go
ahead
it
is
this
this
determination
not
to
let
the
horrors
or
the
blues
take
possession
of
you
so
as
to
make
you
relax
your
energies
in
the
struggle
for
independence
which
you
must
cultivate
how
many
have
almost
reached
the
goal
of
their
ambition
but
losing
faith
in
themselves
have
relaxed
their
energies
and
the
golden
prize
has
been
lost
forever
it
is
no
doubt
often
true
as
shakespeare
says
there
is
a
tide
in
the
affairs
of
men
which
taken
at
the
flood
leads
on
to
fortune
if
you
hesitate
some
bolder
hand
will
stretch
out
before
you
and
get
the
prize
remember
the
proverb
of
solomon
he
becometh
poor
that
dealeth
with
a
slack
hand
but
the
hand
of
the
diligent
maketh
rich
perseverance
is
sometimes
but
another
word
for
many
persons
naturally
look
on
the
dark
side
of
life
and
borrow
trouble
they
are
born
so
then
they
ask
for
advice
and
they
will
be
governed
by
one
wind
and
blown
by
another
and
can
not
rely
upon
themselves
until
you
can
get
so
that
you
can
rely
upon
yourself
you
need
not
expect
to
succeed
i
have
known
men
personally
who
have
met
with
pecuniary
reverses
and
absolutely
committed
suicide
because
they
thought
they
could
never
overcome
their
misfortune
but
i
have
known
others
who
have
met
more
serious
financial
difficulties
and
have
bridged
them
over
by
simple
perseverance
aided
by
a
firm
belief
that
they
were
doing
justly
and
that
providence
would
overcome
evil
with
good
you
will
see
this
illustrated
in
any
sphere
of
life
take
two
generals
both
understand
military
tactics
both
educated
at
west
point
if
you
please
both
equally
gifted
yet
one
having
this
principle
of
perseverance
and
the
other
lacking
it
the
former
will
succeed
in
his
profession
while
the
latter
will
fail
one
may
hear
the
cry
the
enemy
are
coming
and
they
have
got
cannon
got
cannon
says
the
hesitating
general
yes
then
halt
every
man
he
wants
time
to
reflect
his
hesitation
is
his
ruin
the
enemy
passes
unmolested
or
overwhelms
him
while
on
the
other
hand
the
general
of
pluck
perseverance
and
goes
into
battle
with
a
will
and
amid
the
clash
of
arms
the
booming
of
cannon
the
shrieks
of
the
wounded
and
the
moans
of
the
dying
you
will
see
this
man
persevering
going
on
cutting
and
slashing
his
way
through
with
unwavering
determination
inspiring
his
soldiers
to
deeds
of
fortitude
valor
and
triumph
whatever
you
do
do
it
with
all
your
might
work
at
it
if
necessary
early
and
late
in
season
and
out
of
season
not
leaving
a
stone
unturned
and
never
deferring
for
a
single
hour
that
which
can
be
done
just
as
well
now
the
old
proverb
is
full
of
truth
and
meaning
whatever
is
worth
doing
at
all
is
worth
doing
well
many
a
man
acquires
a
fortune
by
doing
his
business
thoroughly
while
his
neighbor
remains
poor
for
life
because
he
only
half
does
it
ambition
energy
industry
perseverance
are
indispensable
requisites
for
success
in
business
fortune
always
favors
the
brave
and
never
helps
a
man
who
does
not
help
himself
it
wo
do
to
spend
your
time
like
micawber
in
waiting
for
something
to
turn
up
to
such
men
one
of
two
things
usually
turns
up
the
poorhouse
or
the
jail
for
idleness
breeds
bad
habits
and
clothes
a
man
in
rags
the
poor
spendthrift
vagabond
says
to
a
rich
man
i
have
discovered
there
is
enough
money
in
the
world
for
all
of
us
if
it
was
equally
divided
this
must
be
done
and
we
shall
all
be
happy
together
but
was
the
response
if
everybody
was
like
you
it
would
be
spent
in
two
months
and
what
would
you
do
then
oh
divide
again
keep
dividing
of
course
i
was
recently
reading
in
a
london
paper
an
account
of
a
like
philosophic
pauper
who
was
kicked
out
of
a
cheap
because
he
could
not
pay
his
bill
but
he
had
a
roll
of
papers
sticking
out
of
his
coat
pocket
which
upon
examination
proved
to
be
his
plan
for
paying
off
the
national
debt
of
england
without
the
aid
of
a
penny
people
have
got
to
do
as
cromwell
said
not
only
trust
in
providence
but
keep
the
powder
dry
do
your
part
of
the
work
or
you
can
not
succeed
mahomet
one
night
while
encamping
in
the
desert
overheard
one
of
his
fatigued
followers
remark
i
will
loose
my
camel
and
trust
it
to
god
no
no
not
so
said
the
prophet
tie
thy
camel
and
trust
it
to
god
do
all
you
can
for
yourselves
and
then
trust
to
providence
or
luck
or
whatever
you
please
to
call
it
for
the
rest
depend
upon
your
own
personal
exertions
the
eye
of
the
employer
is
often
worth
more
than
the
hands
of
a
dozen
employees
in
the
nature
of
things
an
agent
can
not
be
so
faithful
to
his
employer
as
to
himself
many
who
are
employers
will
call
to
mind
instances
where
the
best
employees
have
overlooked
important
points
which
could
not
have
escaped
their
own
observation
as
a
proprietor
no
man
has
a
right
to
expect
to
succeed
in
life
unless
he
understands
his
business
and
nobody
can
understand
his
business
thoroughly
unless
he
learns
it
by
personal
application
and
experience
a
man
may
be
a
manufacturer
he
has
got
to
learn
the
many
details
of
his
business
personally
he
will
learn
something
every
day
and
he
will
find
he
will
make
mistakes
nearly
every
day
and
these
very
mistakes
are
helps
to
him
in
the
way
of
experiences
if
he
but
heeds
them
he
will
be
like
the
yankee
who
having
been
cheated
as
to
quality
in
the
purchase
of
his
merchandise
said
all
right
there
a
little
information
to
be
gained
every
day
i
will
never
be
cheated
in
that
way
again
thus
a
man
buys
his
experience
and
it
is
the
best
kind
if
not
purchased
at
too
dear
a
rate
i
hold
that
every
man
should
like
cuvier
the
french
naturalist
thoroughly
know
his
business
so
proficient
was
he
in
the
study
of
natural
history
that
you
might
bring
to
him
the
bone
or
even
a
section
of
a
bone
of
an
animal
which
he
had
never
seen
described
and
reasoning
from
analogy
he
would
be
able
to
draw
a
picture
of
the
object
from
which
the
bone
had
been
taken
on
one
occasion
his
students
attempted
to
deceive
him
they
rolled
one
of
their
number
in
a
cow
skin
and
put
him
under
the
professor
table
as
a
new
specimen
when
the
philosopher
came
into
the
room
some
of
the
students
asked
him
what
animal
it
was
suddenly
the
animal
said
i
am
the
devil
and
i
am
going
to
eat
you
it
was
but
natural
that
cuvier
should
desire
to
classify
this
creature
and
examining
it
intently
he
said
divided
hoof
graminivorous
it
can
not
be
done
he
knew
that
an
animal
with
a
split
hoof
must
live
upon
grass
and
grain
or
other
kind
of
vegetation
and
would
not
be
inclined
to
eat
flesh
dead
or
alive
so
he
considered
himself
perfectly
safe
the
possession
of
a
perfect
knowledge
of
your
business
is
an
absolute
necessity
in
order
to
insure
success
among
the
maxims
of
the
elder
rothschild
was
one
all
apparent
paradox
be
cautious
and
bold
this
seems
to
be
a
contradiction
in
terms
but
it
is
not
and
there
is
great
wisdom
in
the
maxim
it
is
in
fact
a
condensed
statement
of
what
i
have
already
said
it
is
to
say
you
must
exercise
your
caution
in
laying
your
plans
but
be
bold
in
carrying
them
out
a
man
who
is
all
caution
will
never
dare
to
take
hold
and
be
successful
and
a
man
who
is
all
boldness
is
merely
reckless
and
must
eventually
fail
a
man
may
go
on
and
make
fifty
or
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
speculating
in
stocks
at
a
single
operation
but
if
he
has
simple
boldness
without
caution
it
is
mere
chance
and
what
he
gains
he
will
lose
you
must
have
both
the
caution
and
the
boldness
to
insure
success
the
rothschilds
have
another
maxim
never
have
anything
to
do
with
an
unlucky
man
or
place
that
is
to
say
never
have
anything
to
do
with
a
man
or
place
which
never
succeeds
because
although
a
man
may
appear
to
be
honest
and
intelligent
yet
if
he
tries
this
or
that
thing
and
always
fails
it
is
on
account
of
some
fault
or
infirmity
that
you
may
not
be
able
to
discover
but
nevertheless
which
must
exist
there
is
no
such
thing
in
the
world
as
luck
there
never
was
a
man
who
could
go
out
in
the
morning
and
find
a
purse
full
of
gold
in
the
street
and
another
and
so
on
day
after
day
he
may
do
so
once
in
his
life
but
so
far
as
mere
luck
is
concerned
he
is
as
liable
to
lose
it
as
to
find
it
like
causes
produce
like
effects
if
a
man
adopts
the
proper
methods
to
be
successful
luck
will
not
prevent
him
if
he
does
not
succeed
there
are
reasons
for
it
although
perhaps
he
may
not
be
able
to
see
them
use
the
best
tools
men
in
engaging
employees
should
be
careful
to
get
the
best
understand
you
can
not
have
too
good
tools
to
work
with
and
there
is
no
tool
you
should
be
so
particular
about
as
living
tools
if
you
get
a
good
one
it
is
better
to
keep
him
than
keep
changing
he
learns
something
every
day
and
you
are
benefited
by
the
experience
he
acquires
he
is
worth
more
to
you
this
year
than
last
and
he
is
the
last
man
to
part
with
provided
his
habits
are
good
and
he
continues
faithful
if
as
he
gets
more
valuable
he
demands
an
exorbitant
increase
of
salary
on
the
supposition
that
you
ca
do
without
him
let
him
go
whenever
i
have
such
an
employee
i
always
discharge
him
first
to
convince
him
that
his
place
may
be
supplied
and
second
because
he
is
good
for
nothing
if
he
thinks
he
is
invaluable
and
can
not
be
spared
but
i
would
keep
him
if
possible
in
order
to
profit
from
the
result
of
his
experience
an
important
element
in
an
employee
is
the
brain
you
can
see
bills
up
hands
wanted
but
hands
are
not
worth
a
great
deal
without
heads
beecher
illustrates
this
in
this
wise
an
employee
offers
his
services
by
saving
i
have
a
pair
of
hands
and
one
of
my
fingers
thinks
that
is
very
good
says
the
employer
another
man
comes
along
and
says
he
has
two
fingers
that
think
ah
that
is
better
but
a
third
calls
in
and
says
that
all
his
fingers
and
thumbs
think
that
is
better
still
finally
another
steps
in
and
says
i
have
a
brain
that
thinks
i
think
all
over
i
am
a
thinking
as
well
as
a
working
man
you
are
the
man
i
want
says
the
delighted
employer
those
men
who
have
brains
and
experience
are
therefore
the
most
valuable
and
not
to
be
readily
parted
with
it
is
better
for
them
as
well
as
yourself
to
keep
them
at
reasonable
advances
in
their
salaries
from
time
to
time
do
get
above
your
business
young
men
after
they
get
through
their
business
training
or
apprenticeship
instead
of
pursuing
their
avocation
and
rising
in
their
business
will
often
lie
about
doing
nothing
they
say
i
have
learned
my
business
but
i
am
not
going
to
be
a
hireling
what
is
the
object
of
learning
my
trade
or
profession
unless
i
establish
myself
have
you
capital
to
start
with
no
but
i
am
going
to
have
it
how
are
you
going
to
get
it
i
will
tell
you
confidentially
i
have
a
wealthy
old
aunt
and
she
will
die
pretty
soon
but
if
she
does
not
i
expect
to
find
some
rich
old
man
who
will
lend
me
a
few
thousands
to
give
me
a
start
if
i
only
get
the
money
to
start
with
i
will
do
well
there
is
no
greater
mistake
than
when
a
young
man
believes
he
will
succeed
with
borrowed
money
why
because
every
man
experience
coincides
with
that
of
astor
who
said
it
was
more
difficult
for
him
to
accumulate
his
first
thousand
dollars
than
all
the
succeeding
millions
that
made
up
his
colossal
fortune
money
is
good
for
nothing
unless
you
know
the
value
of
it
by
experience
give
a
boy
twenty
thousand
dollars
and
put
him
in
business
and
the
chances
are
that
he
will
lose
every
dollar
of
it
before
he
is
a
year
older
like
buying
a
ticket
in
the
lottery
and
drawing
a
prize
it
is
easy
come
easy
go
he
does
not
know
the
value
of
it
nothing
is
worth
anything
unless
it
costs
effort
without
and
economy
patience
and
perseverance
and
commencing
with
capital
which
you
have
not
earned
you
are
not
sure
to
succeed
in
accumulating
young
men
instead
of
waiting
for
dead
men
shoes
should
be
up
and
doing
for
there
is
no
class
of
persons
who
are
so
unaccommodating
in
regard
to
dying
as
these
rich
old
people
and
it
is
fortunate
for
the
expectant
heirs
that
it
is
so
nine
out
of
ten
of
the
rich
men
of
our
country
started
out
in
life
as
poor
boys
with
determined
wills
industry
perseverance
economy
and
good
habits
they
went
on
gradually
made
their
own
money
and
saved
it
and
this
is
the
best
way
to
acquire
a
fortune
stephen
girard
started
life
as
a
poor
cabin
boy
and
died
worth
nine
million
dollars
stewart
was
a
poor
irish
boy
and
he
paid
taxes
on
a
million
and
a
half
dollars
of
income
per
year
john
jacob
astor
was
a
poor
farmer
boy
and
died
worth
twenty
millions
cornelius
vanderbilt
began
life
rowing
a
boat
from
staten
island
to
new
york
he
presented
our
government
with
a
steamship
worth
a
million
of
dollars
and
died
worth
fifty
million
there
is
no
royal
road
to
learning
says
the
proverb
and
i
may
say
it
is
equally
true
there
is
no
royal
road
to
wealth
but
i
think
there
is
a
royal
road
to
both
the
road
to
learning
is
a
royal
one
the
road
that
enables
the
student
to
expand
his
intellect
and
add
every
day
to
his
stock
of
knowledge
until
in
the
pleasant
process
of
intellectual
growth
he
is
able
to
solve
the
most
profound
problems
to
count
the
stars
to
analyze
every
atom
of
the
globe
and
to
measure
the
firmament
this
is
a
regal
highway
and
it
is
the
only
road
worth
traveling
so
in
regard
to
wealth
go
on
in
confidence
study
the
rules
and
above
all
things
study
human
nature
for
the
proper
study
of
mankind
is
man
and
you
will
find
that
while
expanding
the
intellect
and
the
muscles
your
enlarged
experience
will
enable
you
every
day
to
accumulate
more
and
more
principal
which
will
increase
itself
by
interest
and
otherwise
until
you
arrive
at
a
state
of
independence
you
will
find
as
a
general
thing
that
the
poor
boys
get
rich
and
the
rich
boys
get
poor
for
instance
a
rich
man
at
his
decease
leaves
a
large
estate
to
his
family
his
eldest
sons
who
have
helped
him
earn
his
fortune
know
by
experience
the
value
of
money
and
they
take
their
inheritance
and
add
to
it
the
separate
portions
of
the
young
children
are
placed
at
interest
and
the
little
fellows
are
patted
on
the
head
and
told
a
dozen
times
a
day
you
are
rich
you
will
never
have
to
work
you
can
always
have
whatever
you
wish
for
you
were
born
with
a
golden
spoon
in
your
mouth
the
young
heir
soon
finds
out
what
that
means
he
has
the
finest
dresses
and
playthings
he
is
crammed
with
sugar
candies
and
almost
killed
with
kindness
and
he
passes
from
school
to
school
petted
and
flattered
he
becomes
arrogant
and
abuses
his
teachers
and
carries
everything
with
a
high
hand
he
knows
nothing
of
the
real
value
of
money
having
never
earned
any
but
he
knows
all
about
the
golden
spoon
business
at
college
he
invites
his
poor
to
his
room
where
he
wines
and
dines
them
he
is
cajoled
and
caressed
and
called
a
glorious
good
follow
because
he
is
so
lavish
of
his
money
he
gives
his
game
suppers
drives
his
fast
horses
invites
his
chums
to
fetes
and
parties
determined
to
have
lots
of
good
times
he
spends
the
night
in
frolics
and
debauchery
and
leads
off
his
companions
with
the
familiar
song
we
wo
go
home
till
morning
he
gets
them
to
join
him
in
pulling
down
signs
taking
gates
from
their
hinges
and
throwing
them
into
back
yards
and
if
the
police
arrest
them
he
knocks
them
down
is
taken
to
the
lockup
and
joyfully
foots
the
bills
ah
my
boys
he
cries
what
is
the
use
of
being
rich
if
you
enjoy
yourself
he
might
more
truly
say
if
you
ca
make
a
fool
of
yourself
but
he
is
fast
hates
slow
things
and
does
see
it
young
men
loaded
down
with
other
people
money
are
almost
sure
to
lose
all
they
inherit
and
they
acquire
all
sorts
of
bad
habits
which
in
the
majority
of
cases
ruin
them
in
health
purse
and
character
in
this
country
one
generation
follows
another
and
the
poor
of
are
rich
in
the
next
generation
or
the
third
their
experience
leads
them
on
and
they
become
rich
and
they
leave
vast
riches
to
their
young
children
these
children
having
been
reared
in
luxury
are
inexperienced
and
get
poor
and
after
long
experience
another
generation
comes
on
and
gathers
up
riches
again
in
turn
and
thus
history
repeats
itself
and
happy
is
he
who
by
listening
to
the
experience
of
others
avoids
the
rocks
and
shoals
on
which
so
many
have
been
wrecked
in
england
the
business
makes
the
man
if
a
man
in
that
country
is
a
mechanic
or
he
is
not
recognized
as
a
gentleman
on
the
occasion
of
my
first
appearance
before
queen
victoria
the
duke
of
wellington
asked
me
what
sphere
in
life
general
tom
thumb
parents
were
in
his
father
is
a
carpenter
i
replied
oh
i
had
heard
he
was
a
gentleman
was
the
response
of
his
grace
in
this
republican
country
the
man
makes
the
business
no
matter
whether
he
is
a
blacksmith
a
shoemaker
a
farmer
banker
or
lawyer
so
long
as
his
business
is
legitimate
he
may
be
a
gentleman
so
any
legitimate
business
is
a
double
blessing
it
helps
the
man
engaged
in
it
and
also
helps
others
the
farmer
supports
his
own
family
but
he
also
benefits
the
merchant
or
mechanic
who
needs
the
products
of
his
farm
the
tailor
not
only
makes
a
living
by
his
trade
but
he
also
benefits
the
farmer
the
clergyman
and
others
who
can
not
make
their
own
clothing
but
all
these
classes
often
may
be
gentlemen
the
great
ambition
should
be
to
excel
all
others
engaged
in
the
same
occupation
the
who
was
about
graduating
said
to
an
old
lawyer
i
have
not
yet
decided
which
profession
i
will
follow
is
your
profession
full
the
basement
is
much
crowded
but
there
is
plenty
of
room
was
the
witty
and
truthful
reply
no
profession
trade
or
calling
is
overcrowded
in
the
upper
story
wherever
you
find
the
most
honest
and
intelligent
merchant
or
banker
or
the
best
lawyer
the
best
doctor
the
best
clergyman
the
best
shoemaker
carpenter
or
anything
else
that
man
is
most
sought
for
and
has
always
enough
to
do
as
a
nation
americans
are
too
superficial
they
are
striving
to
get
rich
quickly
and
do
not
generally
do
their
business
as
substantially
and
thoroughly
as
they
should
but
whoever
excels
all
others
in
his
own
line
if
his
habits
are
good
and
his
integrity
undoubted
can
not
fail
to
secure
abundant
patronage
and
the
wealth
that
naturally
follows
let
your
motto
then
always
be
excelsior
for
by
living
up
to
it
there
is
no
such
word
as
fail
learn
something
useful
every
man
should
make
his
son
or
daughter
learn
some
useful
trade
or
profession
so
that
in
these
days
of
changing
fortunes
of
being
rich
and
poor
tomorrow
they
may
have
something
tangible
to
fall
back
upon
this
provision
might
save
many
persons
from
misery
who
by
some
unexpected
turn
of
fortune
have
lost
all
their
means
let
hope
predominate
but
be
not
too
visionary
many
persons
are
always
kept
poor
because
they
are
too
visionary
every
project
looks
to
them
like
certain
success
and
therefore
they
keep
changing
from
one
business
to
another
always
in
hot
water
always
under
the
harrow
the
plan
of
counting
the
chickens
before
they
are
hatched
is
an
error
of
ancient
date
but
it
does
not
seem
to
improve
by
age
do
not
scatter
your
powers
engage
in
one
kind
of
business
only
and
stick
to
it
faithfully
until
you
succeed
or
until
your
experience
shows
that
you
should
abandon
it
a
constant
hammering
on
one
nail
will
generally
drive
it
home
at
last
so
that
it
can
be
clinched
when
a
man
undivided
attention
is
centered
on
one
object
his
mind
will
constantly
be
suggesting
improvements
of
value
which
would
escape
him
if
his
brain
was
occupied
by
a
dozen
different
subjects
at
once
many
a
fortune
has
slipped
through
a
fingers
because
he
was
engaged
in
too
many
occupations
at
a
time
there
is
good
sense
in
the
old
caution
against
having
too
many
irons
in
the
fire
at
once
be
systematic
men
should
be
systematic
in
their
business
a
person
who
does
business
by
rule
having
a
time
and
place
for
everything
doing
his
work
promptly
will
accomplish
twice
as
much
and
with
half
the
trouble
of
him
who
does
it
carelessly
and
slipshod
by
introducing
system
into
all
your
transactions
doing
one
thing
at
a
time
always
meeting
appointments
with
punctuality
you
find
leisure
for
pastime
and
recreation
whereas
the
man
who
only
half
does
one
thing
and
then
turns
to
something
else
and
half
does
that
will
have
his
business
at
loose
ends
and
will
never
know
when
his
day
work
is
done
for
it
never
will
be
done
of
course
there
is
a
limit
to
all
these
rules
we
must
try
to
preserve
the
happy
medium
for
there
is
such
a
thing
as
being
too
systematic
there
are
men
and
women
for
instance
who
put
away
things
so
carefully
that
they
can
never
find
them
again
it
is
too
much
like
the
red
tape
formality
at
washington
and
dickens
circumlocution
office
all
theory
and
no
result
when
the
astor
house
was
first
started
in
new
york
city
it
was
undoubtedly
the
best
hotel
in
the
country
the
proprietors
had
learned
a
good
deal
in
europe
regarding
hotels
and
the
landlords
were
proud
of
the
rigid
system
which
pervaded
every
department
of
their
great
establishment
when
twelve
at
night
had
arrived
and
there
were
a
number
of
guests
around
one
of
the
proprietors
would
say
touch
that
bell
john
and
in
two
minutes
sixty
servants
with
a
in
each
hand
would
present
themselves
in
the
hall
this
said
the
landlord
addressing
his
guests
is
our
it
will
show
you
we
are
quite
safe
here
we
do
everything
systematically
this
was
before
the
croton
water
was
introduced
into
the
city
but
they
sometimes
carried
their
system
too
far
on
one
occasion
when
the
hotel
was
thronged
with
guests
one
of
the
waiters
was
suddenly
indisposed
and
although
there
were
fifty
waiters
in
the
hotel
the
landlord
thought
he
must
have
his
full
complement
or
his
system
would
be
interfered
with
just
before
he
rushed
down
stairs
and
said
there
must
be
another
waiter
i
am
one
waiter
short
what
can
i
do
he
happened
to
see
boots
the
irishman
pat
said
he
wash
your
hands
and
face
take
that
white
apron
and
come
into
the
in
five
minutes
presently
pat
appeared
as
required
and
the
proprietor
said
now
pat
you
must
stand
behind
these
two
chairs
and
wait
on
the
gentlemen
who
will
occupy
them
did
you
ever
act
as
a
waiter
i
know
all
about
it
sure
but
i
never
did
it
like
the
irish
pilot
on
one
occasion
when
the
captain
thinking
he
was
considerably
out
of
his
course
asked
are
you
certain
you
understand
what
you
are
doing
pat
replied
sure
and
i
knows
every
rock
in
the
channel
that
moment
bang
thumped
the
vessel
against
a
rock
ah
and
that
is
one
of
continued
the
pilot
but
to
return
to
the
pat
said
the
landlord
here
we
do
everything
systematically
you
must
first
give
the
gentlemen
each
a
plate
of
soup
and
when
they
finish
that
ask
them
what
they
will
have
next
pat
replied
ah
an
i
understand
parfectly
the
vartues
of
shystem
very
soon
in
came
the
guests
the
plates
of
soup
were
placed
before
them
one
of
pat
two
gentlemen
ate
his
soup
the
other
did
not
care
for
it
he
said
waiter
take
this
plate
away
and
bring
me
some
fish
pat
looked
at
the
untasted
plate
of
soup
and
remembering
the
instructions
of
the
landlord
in
regard
to
system
replied
not
till
ye
have
ate
yer
supe
of
course
that
was
carrying
system
entirely
too
far
read
the
newspapers
always
take
a
trustworthy
newspaper
and
thus
keep
thoroughly
posted
in
regard
to
the
transactions
of
the
world
he
who
is
without
a
newspaper
is
cut
off
from
his
species
in
these
days
of
telegraphs
and
steam
many
important
inventions
and
improvements
in
every
branch
of
trade
are
being
made
and
he
who
do
consult
the
newspapers
will
soon
find
himself
and
his
business
left
out
in
the
cold
beware
of
outside
operations
we
sometimes
see
men
who
have
obtained
fortunes
suddenly
become
poor
in
many
cases
this
arises
from
intemperance
and
often
from
gaming
and
other
bad
habits
frequently
it
occurs
because
a
man
has
been
engaged
in
outside
operations
of
some
sort
when
he
gets
rich
in
his
legitimate
business
he
is
told
of
a
grand
speculation
where
he
can
make
a
score
of
thousands
he
is
constantly
flattered
by
his
friends
who
tell
him
that
he
is
born
lucky
that
everything
he
touches
turns
into
gold
now
if
he
forgets
that
his
economical
habits
his
rectitude
of
conduct
and
a
personal
attention
to
a
business
which
he
understood
caused
his
success
in
life
he
will
listen
to
the
siren
voices
he
says
i
will
put
in
twenty
thousand
dollars
i
have
been
lucky
and
my
good
luck
will
soon
bring
me
back
sixty
thousand
dollars
a
few
days
elapse
and
it
is
discovered
he
must
put
in
ten
thousand
dollars
more
soon
after
he
is
told
it
is
all
right
but
certain
matters
not
foreseen
require
an
advance
of
twenty
thousand
dollars
more
which
will
bring
him
a
rich
harvest
but
before
the
time
comes
around
to
realize
the
bubble
bursts
he
loses
all
he
is
possessed
of
and
then
he
learns
what
he
ought
to
have
known
at
the
first
that
however
successful
a
man
may
be
in
his
own
business
if
he
turns
from
that
and
engages
ill
a
business
which
he
do
understand
he
is
like
samson
when
shorn
of
his
locks
his
strength
has
departed
and
he
becomes
like
other
men
if
a
man
has
plenty
of
money
he
ought
to
invest
something
in
everything
that
appears
to
promise
success
and
that
will
probably
benefit
mankind
but
let
the
sums
thus
invested
be
moderate
in
amount
and
never
let
a
man
foolishly
jeopardize
a
fortune
that
he
has
earned
in
a
legitimate
way
by
investing
it
in
things
in
which
he
has
had
no
experience
do
indorse
without
security
i
hold
that
no
man
ought
ever
to
indorse
a
note
or
become
security
for
any
man
be
it
his
father
or
brother
to
a
greater
extent
than
he
can
afford
to
lose
and
care
nothing
about
without
taking
good
security
here
is
a
man
that
is
worth
twenty
thousand
dollars
he
is
doing
a
thriving
manufacturing
or
mercantile
trade
you
are
retired
and
living
on
your
money
he
comes
to
you
and
says
you
are
aware
that
i
am
worth
twenty
thousand
dollars
and
do
owe
a
dollar
if
i
had
five
thousand
dollars
in
cash
i
could
purchase
a
particular
lot
of
goods
and
double
my
money
in
a
couple
of
months
will
you
indorse
my
note
for
that
amount
you
reflect
that
he
is
worth
twenty
thousand
dollars
and
you
incur
no
risk
by
endorsing
his
note
you
like
to
accommodate
him
and
you
lend
your
name
without
taking
the
precaution
of
getting
security
shortly
after
he
shows
you
the
note
with
your
endorsement
canceled
and
tells
you
probably
truly
that
he
made
the
profit
that
he
expected
by
the
operation
you
reflect
that
you
have
done
a
good
action
and
the
thought
makes
you
feel
happy
by
and
by
the
same
thing
occurs
again
and
you
do
it
again
you
have
already
fixed
the
impression
in
your
mind
that
it
is
perfectly
safe
to
indorse
his
notes
without
security
but
the
trouble
is
this
man
is
getting
money
too
easily
he
has
only
to
take
your
note
to
the
bank
get
it
discounted
and
take
the
cash
he
gets
money
for
the
time
being
without
effort
without
inconvenience
to
himself
now
mark
the
result
he
sees
a
chance
for
speculation
outside
of
his
business
a
temporary
investment
of
only
is
required
it
is
sure
to
come
back
before
a
note
at
the
bank
would
be
due
he
places
a
note
for
that
amount
before
you
you
sign
it
almost
mechanically
being
firmly
convinced
that
your
friend
is
responsible
and
trustworthy
you
indorse
his
notes
as
a
matter
of
course
unfortunately
the
speculation
does
not
come
to
a
head
quite
so
soon
as
was
expected
and
another
note
must
be
discounted
to
take
up
the
last
one
when
due
before
this
note
matures
the
speculation
has
proved
an
utter
failure
and
all
the
money
is
lost
does
the
loser
tell
his
friend
the
endorser
that
he
has
lost
half
of
his
fortune
not
at
all
he
do
even
mention
that
he
has
speculated
at
all
but
he
has
got
excited
the
spirit
of
speculation
has
seized
him
he
sees
others
making
large
sums
in
this
way
we
seldom
hear
of
the
losers
and
like
other
speculators
he
looks
for
his
money
where
he
loses
it
he
tries
again
endorsing
notes
has
become
chronic
with
you
and
at
every
loss
he
gets
your
signature
for
whatever
amount
he
wants
finally
you
discover
your
friend
has
lost
all
of
his
property
and
all
of
yours
you
are
overwhelmed
with
astonishment
and
grief
and
you
say
it
is
a
hard
thing
my
friend
here
has
ruined
me
but
you
should
add
i
have
also
ruined
him
if
you
had
said
in
the
first
place
i
will
accommodate
you
but
i
never
indorse
without
taking
ample
security
he
could
not
have
gone
beyond
the
length
of
his
tether
and
he
would
never
have
been
tempted
away
from
his
legitimate
business
it
is
a
very
dangerous
thing
therefore
at
any
time
to
let
people
get
possession
of
money
too
easily
it
tempts
them
to
hazardous
speculations
if
nothing
more
solomon
truly
said
he
that
hateth
suretiship
is
sure
so
with
the
young
man
starting
in
business
let
him
understand
the
value
of
money
by
earning
it
when
he
does
understand
its
value
then
grease
the
wheels
a
little
in
helping
him
to
start
business
but
remember
men
who
get
money
with
too
great
facility
can
not
usually
succeed
you
must
get
the
first
dollars
by
hard
knocks
and
at
some
sacrifice
in
order
to
appreciate
the
value
of
those
dollars
advertise
your
business
we
all
depend
more
or
less
upon
the
public
for
our
support
we
all
trade
with
the
public
lawyers
doctors
shoemakers
artists
blacksmiths
showmen
opera
stagers
railroad
presidents
and
college
professors
those
who
deal
with
the
public
must
be
careful
that
their
goods
are
valuable
that
they
are
genuine
and
will
give
satisfaction
when
you
get
an
article
which
you
know
is
going
to
please
your
customers
and
that
when
they
have
tried
it
they
will
feel
they
have
got
their
money
worth
then
let
the
fact
be
known
that
you
have
got
it
be
careful
to
advertise
it
in
some
shape
or
other
because
it
is
evident
that
if
a
man
has
ever
so
good
an
article
for
sale
and
nobody
knows
it
it
will
bring
him
no
return
in
a
country
like
this
where
nearly
everybody
reads
and
where
newspapers
are
issued
and
circulated
in
editions
of
five
thousand
to
two
hundred
thousand
it
would
be
very
unwise
if
this
channel
was
not
taken
advantage
of
to
reach
the
public
in
advertising
a
newspaper
goes
into
the
family
and
is
read
by
wife
and
children
as
well
as
the
head
of
the
home
hence
hundreds
and
thousands
of
people
may
read
your
advertisement
while
you
are
attending
to
your
routine
business
many
perhaps
read
it
while
you
are
asleep
the
whole
philosophy
of
life
is
first
sow
then
reap
that
is
the
way
the
farmer
does
he
plants
his
potatoes
and
corn
and
sows
his
grain
and
then
goes
about
something
else
and
the
time
comes
when
he
reaps
but
he
never
reaps
first
and
sows
afterwards
this
principle
applies
to
all
kinds
of
business
and
to
nothing
more
eminently
than
to
advertising
if
a
man
has
a
genuine
article
there
is
no
way
in
which
he
can
reap
more
advantageously
than
by
sowing
to
the
public
in
this
way
he
must
of
course
have
a
really
good
article
and
one
which
will
please
his
customers
anything
spurious
will
not
succeed
permanently
because
the
public
is
wiser
than
many
imagine
men
and
women
are
selfish
and
we
all
prefer
purchasing
where
we
can
get
the
most
for
our
money
and
we
try
to
find
out
where
we
can
most
surely
do
so
you
may
advertise
a
spurious
article
and
induce
many
people
to
call
and
buy
it
once
but
they
will
denounce
you
as
an
impostor
and
swindler
and
your
business
will
gradually
die
out
and
leave
you
poor
this
is
right
few
people
can
safely
depend
upon
chance
custom
you
all
need
to
have
your
customers
return
and
purchase
again
a
man
said
to
me
i
have
tried
advertising
and
did
not
succeed
yet
i
have
a
good
article
i
replied
my
friend
there
may
be
exceptions
to
a
general
rule
but
how
do
you
advertise
i
put
it
in
a
weekly
newspaper
three
times
and
paid
a
dollar
and
a
half
for
it
i
replied
sir
advertising
is
like
learning
little
is
a
dangerous
thing
a
french
writer
says
that
the
reader
of
a
newspaper
does
not
see
the
first
mention
of
an
ordinary
advertisement
the
second
insertion
he
sees
but
does
not
read
the
third
insertion
he
reads
the
fourth
insertion
he
looks
at
the
price
the
fifth
insertion
he
speaks
of
it
to
his
wife
the
sixth
insertion
he
is
ready
to
purchase
and
the
seventh
insertion
he
purchases
your
object
in
advertising
is
to
make
the
public
understand
what
you
have
got
to
sell
and
if
you
have
not
the
pluck
to
keep
advertising
until
you
have
imparted
that
information
all
the
money
you
have
spent
is
lost
you
are
like
the
fellow
who
told
the
gentleman
if
he
would
give
him
ten
cents
it
would
save
him
a
dollar
how
can
i
help
you
so
much
with
so
small
a
sum
asked
the
gentleman
in
surprise
i
started
out
this
morning
hiccuped
the
fellow
with
the
full
determination
to
get
drunk
and
i
have
spent
my
only
dollar
to
accomplish
the
object
and
it
has
not
quite
done
it
ten
cents
worth
more
of
whiskey
would
just
do
it
and
in
this
manner
i
should
save
the
dollar
already
expended
so
a
man
who
advertises
at
all
must
keep
it
up
until
the
public
know
who
and
what
he
is
and
what
his
business
is
or
else
the
money
invested
in
advertising
is
lost
some
men
have
a
peculiar
genius
for
writing
a
striking
advertisement
one
that
will
arrest
the
attention
of
the
reader
at
first
sight
this
fact
of
course
gives
the
advertiser
a
great
advantage
sometimes
a
man
makes
himself
popular
by
an
unique
sign
or
a
curious
display
in
his
window
recently
i
observed
a
swing
sign
extending
over
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
a
store
on
which
was
the
inscription
in
plain
letters
do
read
the
other
side
of
course
i
did
and
so
did
everybody
else
and
i
learned
that
the
man
had
made
all
independence
by
first
attracting
the
public
to
his
business
in
that
way
and
then
using
his
customers
well
afterwards
genin
the
hatter
bought
the
first
jenny
lind
ticket
at
auction
for
two
hundred
and
dollars
because
he
knew
it
would
be
a
good
advertisement
for
him
who
is
the
bidder
said
the
auctioneer
as
he
knocked
down
that
ticket
at
castle
garden
genin
the
hatter
was
the
response
here
were
thousands
of
people
from
the
fifth
avenue
and
from
distant
cities
in
the
highest
stations
in
life
who
is
the
hatter
they
exclaimed
they
had
never
heard
of
him
before
the
next
morning
the
newspapers
and
telegraph
had
circulated
the
facts
from
maine
to
texas
and
from
five
to
ten
millions
off
people
had
read
that
the
tickets
sold
at
auction
for
jenny
lind
first
concert
amounted
to
about
twenty
thousand
dollars
and
that
a
single
ticket
was
sold
at
two
hundred
and
dollars
to
genin
the
hatter
men
throughout
the
country
involuntarily
took
off
their
hats
to
see
if
they
had
a
genin
hat
on
their
heads
at
a
town
in
iowa
it
was
found
that
in
the
crowd
around
the
post
office
there
was
one
man
who
had
a
genin
hat
and
he
showed
it
in
triumph
although
it
was
worn
out
and
not
worth
two
cents
why
one
man
exclaimed
you
have
a
real
hat
what
a
lucky
fellow
you
are
another
man
said
hang
on
to
that
hat
it
will
be
a
valuable
in
your
family
still
another
man
in
the
crowd
who
seemed
to
envy
the
possessor
of
this
good
fortune
said
come
give
us
all
a
chance
put
it
up
at
auction
he
did
so
and
it
was
sold
as
a
keepsake
for
nine
dollars
and
fifty
cents
what
was
the
consequence
to
genin
he
sold
ten
thousand
extra
hats
per
annum
the
first
six
years
of
the
purchasers
bought
of
him
probably
out
of
curiosity
and
many
of
them
finding
that
he
gave
them
an
equivalent
for
their
money
became
his
regular
customers
this
novel
advertisement
first
struck
their
attention
and
then
as
he
made
a
good
article
they
came
again
now
i
do
say
that
everybody
should
advertise
as
genin
did
but
i
say
if
a
man
has
got
goods
for
sale
and
he
do
advertise
them
in
some
way
the
chances
are
that
some
day
the
sheriff
will
do
it
for
him
nor
do
i
say
that
everybody
must
advertise
in
a
newspaper
or
indeed
use
printers
ink
at
all
on
the
contrary
although
that
article
is
indispensable
in
the
majority
of
cases
yet
doctors
and
clergymen
and
sometimes
lawyers
and
some
others
can
more
effectually
reach
the
public
in
some
other
manner
but
it
is
obvious
they
must
be
known
in
some
way
else
how
could
they
be
supported
be
polite
and
kind
to
your
customers
politeness
and
civility
are
the
best
capital
ever
invested
in
business
large
stores
gilt
signs
flaming
advertisements
will
all
prove
unavailing
if
you
or
your
employees
treat
your
patrons
abruptly
the
truth
is
the
more
kind
and
liberal
a
man
is
the
more
generous
will
be
the
patronage
bestowed
upon
him
like
begets
like
the
man
who
gives
the
greatest
amount
of
goods
of
a
corresponding
quality
for
the
least
sum
still
reserving
for
himself
a
profit
will
generally
succeed
best
in
the
long
run
this
brings
us
to
the
golden
rule
as
ye
would
that
men
should
do
to
you
do
ye
also
to
them
and
they
will
do
better
by
you
than
if
you
always
treated
them
as
if
you
wanted
to
get
the
most
you
could
out
of
them
for
the
least
return
men
who
drive
sharp
bargains
with
their
customers
acting
as
if
they
never
expected
to
see
them
again
will
not
be
mistaken
they
will
never
see
them
again
as
customers
people
do
like
to
pay
and
get
kicked
also
one
of
the
ushers
in
my
museum
once
told
me
he
intended
to
whip
a
man
who
was
in
the
as
soon
as
he
came
out
what
for
i
inquired
because
he
said
i
was
no
gentleman
replied
the
usher
never
mind
i
replied
he
pays
for
that
and
you
will
not
convince
him
you
are
a
gentleman
by
whipping
him
i
can
not
afford
to
lose
a
customer
if
you
whip
him
he
will
never
visit
the
museum
again
and
he
will
induce
friends
to
go
with
him
to
other
places
of
amusement
instead
of
this
and
thus
you
see
i
should
be
a
serious
loser
but
he
insulted
me
muttered
the
usher
exactly
i
replied
and
if
he
owned
the
museum
and
you
had
paid
him
for
the
privilege
of
visiting
it
and
he
had
then
insulted
you
there
might
be
some
reason
in
your
resenting
it
but
in
this
instance
he
is
the
man
who
pays
while
we
receive
and
you
must
therefore
put
up
with
his
bad
manners
my
usher
laughingly
remarked
that
this
was
undoubtedly
the
true
policy
but
he
added
that
he
should
not
object
to
an
increase
of
salary
if
he
was
expected
to
be
abused
in
order
to
promote
my
interest
be
charitable
of
course
men
should
be
charitable
because
it
is
a
duty
and
a
pleasure
but
even
as
a
matter
of
policy
if
you
possess
no
higher
incentive
you
will
find
that
the
liberal
man
will
command
patronage
while
the
sordid
uncharitable
miser
will
be
avoided
solomon
says
there
is
that
scattereth
and
yet
increaseth
and
there
is
that
withholdeth
more
than

but
it
tendeth
to
poverty
of
course
the
only
true
charity
is
that
which
is
from
the
heart
the
best
kind
of
charity
is
to
help
those
who
are
willing
to
help
themselves
promiscuous
almsgiving
without
inquiring
into
the
worthiness
of
the
applicant
is
bad
in
every
sense
but
to
search
out
and
quietly
assist
those
who
are
struggling
for
themselves
is
the
kind
that
scattereth
and
yet
increaseth
but
do
fall
into
the
idea
that
some
persons
practice
of
giving
a
prayer
instead
of
a
potato
and
a
benediction
instead
of
bread
to
the
hungry
it
is
easier
to
make
christians
with
full
stomachs
than
empty
do
blab
some
men
have
a
foolish
habit
of
telling
their
business
secrets
if
they
make
money
they
like
to
tell
their
neighbors
how
it
was
done
nothing
is
gained
by
this
and
ofttimes
much
is
lost
say
nothing
about
your
profits
your
hopes
your
expectations
your
intentions
and
this
should
apply
to
letters
as
well
as
to
conversation
goethe
makes
mephistophilles
say
never
write
a
letter
nor
destroy
one
business
men
must
write
letters
but
they
should
be
careful
what
they
put
in
them
if
you
are
losing
money
be
specially
cautious
and
not
tell
of
it
or
you
will
lose
your
reputation
preserve
your
integrity
it
is
more
precious
than
diamonds
or
rubies
the
old
miser
said
to
his
sons
get
money
get
it
honestly
if
you
can
but
get
money
this
advice
was
not
only
atrociously
wicked
but
it
was
the
very
essence
of
stupidity
it
was
as
much
as
to
say
if
you
find
it
difficult
to
obtain
money
honestly
you
can
easily
get
it
dishonestly
get
it
in
that
way
poor
fool
not
to
know
that
the
most
difficult
thing
in
life
is
to
make
money
dishonestly
not
to
know
that
our
prisons
are
full
of
men
who
attempted
to
follow
this
advice
not
to
understand
that
no
man
can
be
dishonest
without
soon
being
found
out
and
that
when
his
lack
of
principle
is
discovered
nearly
every
avenue
to
success
is
closed
against
him
forever
the
public
very
properly
shun
all
whose
integrity
is
doubted
no
matter
how
polite
and
pleasant
and
accommodating
a
man
may
be
none
of
us
dare
to
deal
with
him
if
we
suspect
false
weights
and
measures
strict
honesty
not
only
lies
at
the
foundation
of
all
success
in
life
financially
but
in
every
other
respect
uncompromising
integrity
of
character
is
invaluable
it
secures
to
its
possessor
a
peace
and
joy
which
can
not
be
attained
without
it
which
no
amount
of
money
or
houses
and
lands
can
purchase
a
man
who
is
known
to
be
strictly
honest
may
be
ever
so
poor
but
he
has
the
purses
of
all
the
community
at
his
disposal
for
all
know
that
if
he
promises
to
return
what
he
borrows
he
will
never
disappoint
them
as
a
mere
matter
of
selfishness
therefore
if
a
man
had
no
higher
motive
for
being
honest
all
will
find
that
the
maxim
of
franklin
can
never
fail
to
be
true
that
honesty
is
the
best
policy
to
get
rich
is
not
always
equivalent
to
being
successful
there
are
many
rich
poor
men
while
there
are
many
others
honest
and
devout
men
and
women
who
have
never
possessed
so
much
money
as
some
rich
persons
squander
in
a
week
but
who
are
nevertheless
really
richer
and
happier
than
any
man
can
ever
be
while
he
is
a
transgressor
of
the
higher
laws
of
his
being
the
inordinate
love
of
money
no
doubt
may
be
and
is
the
root
of
all
evil
but
money
itself
when
properly
used
is
not
only
a
handy
thing
to
have
in
the
house
but
affords
the
gratification
of
blessing
our
race
by
enabling
its
possessor
to
enlarge
the
scope
of
human
happiness
and
human
influence
the
desire
for
wealth
is
nearly
universal
and
none
can
say
it
is
not
laudable
provided
the
possessor
of
it
accepts
its
responsibilities
and
uses
it
as
a
friend
to
humanity
the
history
of
which
is
commerce
is
a
history
of
civilization
and
wherever
trade
has
flourished
most
there
too
have
art
and
science
produced
the
noblest
fruits
in
fact
as
a
general
thing
are
the
benefactors
of
our
race
to
them
in
a
great
measure
are
we
indebted
for
our
institutions
of
learning
and
of
art
our
academies
colleges
and
churches
it
is
no
argument
against
the
desire
for
or
the
possession
of
wealth
to
say
that
there
are
sometimes
misers
who
hoard
money
only
for
the
sake
of
hoarding
and
who
have
no
higher
aspiration
than
to
grasp
everything
which
comes
within
their
reach
as
we
have
sometimes
hypocrites
in
religion
and
demagogues
in
politics
so
there
are
occasionally
misers
among
these
however
are
only
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
but
when
in
this
country
we
find
such
a
nuisance
and
stumbling
block
as
a
miser
we
remember
with
gratitude
that
in
america
we
have
no
laws
of
primogeniture
and
that
in
the
due
course
of
nature
the
time
will
come
when
the
hoarded
dust
will
be
scattered
for
the
benefit
of
mankind
to
all
men
and
women
therefore
do
i
conscientiously
say
make
money
honestly
and
not
otherwise
for
shakespeare
has
truly
said
he
that
wants
money
means
and
content
is
without

friends
