conclusion
the
stretton
street
affair
prologue
is
about
myself
the
whole
circumstances
of
the
stretton
street
affair
were
so
complicated
and
so
amazing
from
start
to
finish
that
had
the
facts
been
related
to
me
i
confess
i
should
never
have
for
a
moment
given
them
credence
that
they
were
hard
undeniable
facts
presenting
a
problem
both
startling
and
sensational
the
reader
will
quickly
learn
from
this
straightforward
narrative
an
open
confession
of
what
actually
occurred
in
all
innocence
and
certainly
without
any
desire
to
achieve
that
ephemeral
notoriety
which
accrues
from
having
one
portrait
in
the
pictorial
press
and
being
besieged
by
interviewers
in
search
of
a
story
i
found
myself
without
seeking
adventure
one
of
the
chief
actors
in
a
drama
which
was
perhaps
one
of
the
strangest
and
most
astounding
of
this
our
twentieth
century
i
almost
hesitate
to
set
down
the
true
facts
so
utterly
amazing
are
they
indeed
as
i
sit
in
the
silence
of
this
old
brown
room
in
a
and
timbered
surrey
farmhouse
with
pen
and
paper
before
me
i
feel
that
it
is
only
by
a
miracle
that
i
have
been
spared
to
narrate
one
of
the
most
complex
and
ingenious
plots
which
the
human
mind
with
malice
aforethought
ever
conceived
i
ought
i
suppose
in
opening
to
tell
you
something
concerning
myself
hugh
garfield
is
my
name
my
age
and
i
am
the
son
of
the
late
reverend
francis
garfield
rector
of
aldingbourne
and
minor
canon
of
chichester
in
the
war
i
served
with
the
royal
air
force
and
obtained
my
pilot
certificate
i
went
to
france
and
afterwards
to
italy
and
on
being
demobilized
returned
to
my
work
as
an
electrical
engineer
in
the
employ
of
francis
and
goldsmith
the
firm
whose
palatial
offices
are
in
great
george
street
westminster
quite
close
to
the
institute
of
electrical
engineers
though
i
had
obtained
my
degree
in
science
i
was
at
the
time
employed
a
good
deal
upon
clerical
work
five
years
of
war
had
of
course
been
something
of
a
to
my
career
but
in
our
reputable
firm
our
places
had
been
kept
open
for
us
for
those
who
returned
and
we
were
alas
only
three
out
of
perhaps
it
was
that
having
done
my
duty
and
obtained
my
captaincy
and
a
military
cross
the
loyal
firm
regarded
me
with
considerable
favour
at
any
rate
it
set
its
face
against
anything
german
even
in
the
days
when
the
enemy
sent
its
ambassador
to
the
court
of
james
and
we
weakheartedly
reopened
trade
with
the
diabolical
huns
and
allowed
them
to
dump
in
their
cheap
and
nasty
goods
just
as
though
no
war
had
happened
francis
and
goldsmith
was
a
private
firm
and
the
principals
were
both
fine
patriotic
britons
though
electrical
appliances
were
coming
from
germany
wholesale
and
being
put
in
to
the
market
at
prices
with
which
british
firms
could
never
hope
to
compete
yet
they
stuck
to
their
old
resolution
when
in
they
had
joined
the
union
of
no
german
goods
would
that
all
other
firms
electrical
and
otherwise
had
done
likewise
before
i
describe
the
amazing
adventures
which
befell
me
i
suppose
i
ought
to
tell
you
the
exact
circumstances
i
had
an
excellent
business
appointment
with
a
salary
which
was
quite
adequate
for
my
modest
needs
as
a
bachelor
further
my
aunt
emily
had
died
and
left
me
quite
a
comfortable
little
fortune
in
addition
i
shared
a
small
flat
in
rivermead
mansions
just
over
hammersmith
bridge
with
another
bachelor
a
young
solicitor
a
alert
fellow
named
henry
hambledon
who
had
created
quite
a
good
practice
with
only
small
fees
of
course
at
the
hammersmith
police
court
and
its
vicinity
i
first
met
hambledon
at
the
front
years
ago
it
seems
in
these
days
when
events
march
on
so
rapidly
for
nearly
a
year
we
were
until
i
was
sent
to
italy
we
met
again
after
the
armistice
and
set
up
housekeeping
together
our
female
kaiserin
being
a
young
lady
of
about
who
looked
after
us
very
well
and
though
she
possessed
many
idiosyncrasies
did
not
rob
us
quite
so
openly
as
do
most
housekeepers
of
the
london
bachelor
home
harry
was
one
of
the
best
of
good
fellows
he
had
seen
a
lot
of
service
ever
since
he
had
responded
to
his
country
call
and
joined
up
as
a
private
we
always
got
on
excellently
together
so
we
had
furnished
our
pleasant
little
flat
quite
comfortably
and
as
harry
had
looked
after
the
artistic
side
of
its
furnishings
aided
by
a
pal
of
his
an
impecunious
artist
who
lived
in
chelsea
it
certainly
was
a
very
passable
bachelor
snuggery
the
small
front
room
commanded
a
view
over
the
river
with
works
wharves
and
high
factory
chimneys
on
the
middlesex
shore
to
the
left
across
the
long
suspension
bridge
was
chiswick
and
kew
while
to
the
right
lay
putney
and
chelsea
before
the
house
flowed
the
great
broad
muddy
river
where
once
each
year
the
university
eights
flashed
past
while
ever
and
anon
year
in
year
out
noisy
tugs
towed
strings
of
black
barges
up
and
down
the
stream
away
across
the
to
the
left
were
the
great
reservoirs
of
london
water
works
a
huge
open
space
always
fresh
and
breezy
even
within
a
stone
throw
of
stifled
hammersmith
with
its
tubes
and
its
used
as
we
both
had
been
to
years
of
roughing
it
the
spot
had
taken
our
fancy
and
we
got
on
famously
together
on
most
evenings
we
were
out
but
sometimes
before
we
turned
in
we
would
sit
and
smoke
and
laugh
over
our
stirring
adventures
and
humorous
incidents
in
the
war
and
the
scraps
we
had
been
safely
through
since
his
demobilization
harry
had
fallen
deeply
in
love
with
an
extremely
pretty
girl
named
norah
peyton
who
lived
in
a
house
overlooking
the
terrace
gardens
at
richmond
and
whose
father
was
partner
in
a
firm
of
importers
in
mincing
lane
as
for
myself
i
was
unattached
like
every
other
young
man
of
my
age
i
had
of
course
had
several
little
affairs
of
the
heart
all
of
which
had
however
died
within
a
few
short
weeks
now
it
happened
that
on
the
evening
of
the
day
prior
to
the
opening
of
this
strange
series
of
adventures
which
befell
me
i
was
in
the
city
of
york
whither
i
had
gone
on
business
for
the
firm
and
as
my
employers
allowed
travelling
expenses
i
entered
an
empty
compartment
of
the
london
express
which
left
york
at
and
was
due
at
king
cross
at
a
few
moments
later
a
appeared
a
man
who
asked
me
in
french
if
the
train
went
to
london
and
on
my
replying
in
the
affirmative
he
thanked
me
profusely
and
joined
me
i
regret
that
i
alas
know
so
very
leetle
of
your
engleesh
he
remarked
pleasantly
and
continued
in
french
sometimes
my
ignorance
places
me
in
great
difficulty
when
here
knowing
french
fairly
well
we
soon
commenced
to
chat
in
that
language
he
struck
me
as
a
man
of
considerable
refinement
and
education
therefore
it
was
no
surprise
to
me
when
he
told
me
that
as
an
official
at
the
head
office
of
the
crédit
lyonnais
in
paris
it
was
his
duty
sometimes
to
visit
their
correspondents
in
the
chief
commercial
centres
of
great
britain
i
am
on
my
way
from
glasgow
back
to
paris
he
said
but
i
had
to
break
my
journey
in
york
this
morning
i
shall
leave
london
for
paris
i
shall
travel
by
the
he
added
it
is
so
much
quicker
and
far
less
fatiguing
i
have
been
backwards
and
forwards
to
the
croydon
aerodrome
quite
half
a
dozen
times
of
late
yes
i
remarked
travel
by
aeroplane
must
be
of
very
considerable
advantage
to
really
busy
men
and
thus
we
chatted
until
dinner
was
announced
and
we
went
together
along
the
corridor
to
the
where
we
sat
opposite
each
other
as
the
train
sped
along
over
the
flat
fertile
country
through
doncaster
and
grantham
on
that
moonlit
winter
night
we
sat
gossiping
pleasantly
for
i
had
looked
forward
to
a
lonely
journey
back
to
london
i
have
knocked
about
ever
since
the
commencement
of
the
war
but
i
abhor
a
lonely
railway
journey
i
had
had
enough
of
slow
railway
journeys
in
france
and
elsewhere
but
on
that
evening
i
confess
i
was
greatly
taken
with
my
he
had
all
the
alertness
and
exquisite
politeness
of
the
parisian
and
he
compelled
me
to
have
a
benedictine
at
his
expense
then
as
a
pro
he
took
one
of
my
cigarettes
later
when
we
had
concluded
the
usual
and
meal
provided
by
the
great
northern
railway
company
i
often
wonder
who
are
the
culinary
artists
who
devise
those
menus
which
face
us
on
all
english
trains
we
returned
to
our
compartment
to
stretch
ourselves
in
our
corners
and
to
smoke
grantham
we
had
passed
and
we
were
approaching
peterborough
the
old
fen
town
with
the
ancient
cathedral
in
french
my
friend
the
banker
kept
up
a
continuous
chatter
even
though
i
was
tired
and
drowsy
he
had
told
me
much
concerning
himself
and
i
in
turn
told
him
of
my
profession
and
where
i
lived
i
did
not
tell
him
very
much
for
i
am
one
of
those
persons
who
prefer
to
keep
themselves
to
themselves
i
seldom
give
strangers
any
information
after
a
time
indeed
i
tired
of
him
at
last
we
entered
king
cross
a
little
late
as
is
usual
on
a
long
run
i
have
to
get
to
the
carlton
my
companion
said
of
course
there
will
be
no
taxis
but
are
not
you
in
london
very
badly
served
in
that
respect
we
in
paris
have
taxis
at
any
hour
when
your
stations
close
i
find
always
a
great
difficulty
in
getting
a
conveyance
by
the
way
could
you
not
dine
with
me
night
i
am
sorry
i
replied
but
i
have
arranged
to
visit
my
uncle
in
orchard
street
two
minutes
later
the
train
drew
up
slowly
and
wishing
my
i
expressed
a
hope
that
one
day
ere
long
we
might
meet
again
i
had
not
given
him
my
card
as
our
acquaintance
was
only
upon
chance
and
well
after
all
he
was
only
a
passing
foreigner
half
an
hour
after
i
had
stepped
from
the
train
i
was
back
again
in
my
cosy
little
flat
in
rivermead
mansions
after
a
very
strenuous
day
on
the
hall
table
lay
a
letter
from
my
solicitors
i
tore
it
open
eagerly
and
read
that
they
regretted
to
inform
me
that
certain
investments
i
had
made
a
year
before
with
the
money
which
my
aunt
had
left
me
had
not
realized
my
expectations
in
other
words
i
had
lost
the
whole
of
my
money
all
i
possessed
was
the
salary
paid
me
by
francis
and
goldsmith
my
heart
stood
still
the
blow
staggered
me
yet
after
all
i
had
been
a
fool
a
fact
which
my
solicitors
had
hinted
at
the
time
i
crushed
the
letter
in
my
hand
and
passed
on
into
the
little
harry
had
gone
out
to
a
dance
and
had
left
a
scribbled
note
on
the
table
saying
that
he
had
his
latchkey
and
would
not
be
back
until
two
or
so
he
wished
me
cheerio
so
having
smoked
a
final
cigarette
i
retired
next
day
i
went
to
the
office
in
great
george
street
and
reported
upon
the
business
i
had
done
in
york
and
good
business
it
was
too
with
the
municipal
electric
supply
and
in
the
evening
i
returned
across
hammersmith
bridge
at
about
six
at
seven
our
buxom
kaiserin
put
our
meal
upon
the
table
a
roast
a
sweet
and
a
wedge
of
cheshire
cheese
the
mind
of
the
dear
old
soul
who
had
so
many
relations
never
rose
above
the
butcher
joint
and
apple
tart
alas
that
cooking
is
an
art
still
unknown
in
our
dear
old
england
we
sit
at
table
only
by
nature
necessity
not
to
enjoy
the
kindly
fruits
of
the
earth
as
do
other
nations
yet
what
could
we
expect
of
the
charlady
who
looked
after
us
and
who
by
the
way
probably
looked
after
her
own
pocket
as
well
the
bachelor
housekeeper
is
always
a
fifteen
puzzle
twelve
for
herself
and
the
remaining
three
for
her
employer
as
sure
as
rain
comes
in
winter
so
does
the
smug
and
sedate
female
who
keeps
house
for
the
unfortunate
unattached
male
place
the
onus
of
housekeeping
bills
upon
him
and
reap
the
desserts
of
life
for
herself
on
that
particular
evening
i
felt
very
tired
for
in
the
five
days
of
my
absence
many
business
matters
had
accumulated
and
i
had
had
much
to
attend
to
harry
who
ate
hurriedly
even
gobbling
his
food
told
me
that
he
was
taking
norah
to
the
theatre
hence
after
dinner
i
was
left
alone
i
read
the
evening
paper
when
he
had
left
and
then
at
eight
stretched
myself
for
it
was
time
that
i
went
out
to
my
uncle
the
evening
was
cold
and
bright
with
twinkling
stars
which
on
nights
in
london
would
have
caused
much
perturbation
among
average
householders
and
their
families
our
kaiserin
had
gone
home
so
i
rose
put
on
my
overcoat
switched
off
the
lights
and
descended
the
stairs
to
hammersmith
bridge
thus
as
you
my
reader
will
realize
i
went
out
in
the
manner
of
a
million
other
men
in
london
on
that
particular
night
of
wednesday
the
seventh
of
november
and
yet
all
unconsciously
i
plunged
into
a
vortex
of
mystery
and
uncertainty
such
as
perhaps
no
other
living
man
has
ever
experienced
again
i
hesitate
to
pen
these
lines
yet
be
patient
and
i
will
endeavour
as
far
as
i
am
able
in
these
cold
printed
pages
to
reveal
exactly
what
occurred
without
any
exaggeration
or
hysterical
meanderings
my
only
object
being
to
present
to
you
a
plain
straightforward
and
unvarnished
narrative
of
those
amazing
occurrences
and
in
what
astounding
circumstances
i
found
myself
surely
it
was
not
any
of
my
own
seeking
as
you
will
readily
understand
because
i
performed
what
i
believed
to
be
a
good
action
as
most
readers
of
these
pages
would
have
done
in
similar
circumstances
i
was
rewarded
by
unspeakable
trouble
tribulation
and
tragedy
chapter
the
first
introduces
oswald
de
gex
i
had
promised
to
call
upon
charles
latimer
my
bachelor
uncle
a
retired
naval
captain
a
somewhat
crusty
old
fellow
who
lived
in
orchard
street
which
runs
between
oxford
street
and
portman
square
i
usually
went
there
twice
a
week
with
that
intent
i
took
a
motor
from
hammersmith
broadway
as
far
as
hyde
park
corner
as
i
stepped
off
the
rain
began
to
fall
so
turning
up
the
collar
of
my
coat
i
hurried
up
park
lane
at
that
hour
half
deserted
when
up
to
oxford
street
i
turned
into
one
of
the
small
highly
aristocratic
streets
leading
into
park
street
as
a
short
cut
to
orchard
street
the
houses
were
all
of
them
fine
town
mansions
of
the
aristocracy
most
of
them
with
deep
porticos
and
deeper
areas
stretton
street
was
essentially
one
inhabited
by
the
highest
in
london
society
i
had
passed
through
it
many
times
as
a
londoner
does
in
making
short
cuts
without
even
noticing
the
name
the
geography
is
usually
only
by
the
landmarks
of
street
corners
and
tube
stations
as
i
hurried
along
through
the
rain
i
suddenly
heard
a
man
voice
behind
me
say
excuse
me
sir
but
may
i
speak
to
you
for
just
one
second
i
turned
and
as
i
halted
a
young
in
livery
with
waistcoat
of
striped
faced
me
i
sorry
sir
he
exclaimed
breathlessly
but
will
you
wait
just
a
moment
what
do
you
want
i
asked
surprised
at
being
thus
accosted
would
you
oblige
my
master
sir
inquired
the
young
man
eagerly
he
is
in
some
very
great
trouble
only
a
moment
sir
just
come
in
and
see
him
do
poor
fellow
he
in
great
trouble
do
come
in
and
see
him
sir
he
begged
amazed
at
this
appeal
and
my
curiosity
aroused
i
consented
and
followed
the
man
back
to
a
great
mansion
about
fifty
yards
away
the
front
door
in
its
deep
portico
stood
open
just
as
the
servant
had
left
it
when
apparently
he
had
dashed
out
into
the
street
to
accost
the
first
i
sure
my
master
will
be
most
grateful
to
you
sir
the
young
footman
said
as
i
crossed
the
threshold
we
passed
through
a
large
square
hall
and
up
a
great
flight
of
stairs
to
the
library
on
the
first
floor
a
big
sombre
room
lined
with
books
from
floor
to
ceiling
evidently
the
den
of
a
studious
man
in
the
grate
there
burned
a
bright
log
fire
and
on
either
side
stood
two
deep
leather
it
was
a
room
possessing
the
acme
of
cosiness
and
comfort
over
the
fireplace
was
set
a
large
circular
painting
of
the
madonna
and
child
evidently
the
work
of
some
italian
master
of
the
seventeenth
century
while
here
and
there
stood
several
exquisite
bronzes
in
the
window
on
the
left
was
set
a
great
carved
renaissance
and
upon
it
burned
an
electric
lamp
with
an
artistic
shade
of
emerald
glass
a
few
moments
later
a
man
in
entered
hurriedly
almost
breathlessly
i
judged
him
to
be
about
and
decidedly
handsome
but
his
complexion
was
a
trifle
sallow
and
his
features
had
a
decidedly
oriental
cast
he
greeted
me
profusely
in
a
quiet
highly
refined
voice
though
his
appearance
was
foreign
yet
he
was
certainly
english
i
really
awfully
sorry
to
trouble
you
sir
he
said
in
a
tone
of
profuse
apology
but
the
fact
is
that
i
find
myself
in
a
state
of
considerable
perplexity
it
is
extremely
good
of
you
to
consent
to
accompany
horton
back
here
i
only
hope
that
i
have
not
interfered
with
any
appointment
you
have
to
keep
not
at
all
i
replied
wondering
who
my
host
might
be
for
the
whole
affair
was
so
sudden
and
unexpected
that
i
was
bewildered
do
sit
down
and
have
a
cigar
said
my
unknown
host
cheerily
and
he
took
up
a
large
silver
box
from
a
side
table
whereon
was
set
a
decanter
of
whisky
a
syphon
of
soda
water
and
four
glasses
upon
a
beautiful
old
tray
of
georgian
silver
i
selected
a
corona
and
sinking
into
the
inviting
chair
lit
it
while
he
also
took
a
cigar
and
having
clipped
off
the
end
lit
up
as
well
we
chatted
affably
for
my
host
was
certainly
geniality
itself
this
is
quite
an
unexpected
visit
i
remarked
laughing
wondering
still
why
i
had
been
called
in
yes
he
said
i
should
not
have
had
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
had
it
not
been
for
the
great
trouble
i
have
and
he
drew
a
deep
sigh
while
across
his
dark
face
passed
an
expression
of
pain
and
regret
some
men
are
happy
others
are
are
well
unfortunately
unhappy
in
their
domestic
life
i
alas
am
one
of
the
latter
he
added
that
is
very
regrettable
i
said
sympathetically
my
wife
he
said
hoarsely
after
a
pause
my
wife
took
out
my
little
boy
this
evening
and
deliberately
left
him
in
westbourne
grove
just
in
order
to
spite
me
then
she
rang
me
up
from
some
and
told
me
what
she
had
done
put
yourself
in
my
place
he
said
would
you
not
be
indignant
would
you
not
be
filled
with
hatred
and
i
certainly
should
was
my
reply
i
a
bachelor
and
sometimes
when
i
see
so
many
unhappy
marriages
i
fear
to
take
the
matrimonial
plunge
myself
ah
take
my
advice
and
remain
single
as
long
as
ever
you
can
my
dear
sir
i
i
have
the
pleasure
of
your
name
garfield
hugh
garfield
i
said
mine
is
de
gex
oswald
de
gex
he
said
you
may
perhaps
have
heard
of
me
heard
of
oswald
de
gex
of
course
i
had
he
was
reputed
to
be
one
of
the
wealthiest
of
men
but
he
lived
mostly
in
paris
or
at
his
magnificent
villa
outside
florence
it
was
common
knowledge
that
he
had
during
the
war
invested
a
level
million
sterling
in
the
war
loan
while
he
was
constantly
giving
great
donations
to
various
charities
somewhat
eccentric
he
preferred
living
abroad
to
spending
his
time
in
england
because
it
was
said
of
some
personal
quarrel
with
another
member
of
the
house
of
commons
which
had
arisen
over
a
debate
soon
after
he
had
been
elected
i
recollected
too
that
his
wife
whose
handsome
pictured
face
so
often
appeared
in
the
newspapers
was
the
daughter
of
a
sporting
baronet
yet
i
had
never
heard
any
whisper
of
such
matrimonial
troubles
as
he
had
just
revealed
to
me
he
seemed
a
most
man
whose
face
under
the
softly
shaded
electric
light
did
not
now
appear
so
sallow
and
foreign
as
at
first
his
eyes
were
dark
and
rather
deeply
set
while
his
mouth
was
narrow
and
refined
with
a
dimple
in
the
centre
of
his
chin
his
cast
of
features
was
certainly
foreign
and
handsome
withal
a
face
full
of
strength
and
character
when
he
spoke
he
slightly
aspirated
his
c
and
now
and
then
he
gesticulated
when
enthusiastic
due
of
course
to
his
long
residence
abroad
often
i
had
read
in
the
newspapers
of
the
splendid
mediæval
castle
which
he
had
bought
from
the
earl
of
weymount
a
castle
perched
high
upon
the
granite
rocks
facing
the
channel
between
the
lizard
and
ruan
he
had
spent
a
fortune
in
restoring
it
yet
he
very
seldom
visited
it
the
historic
place
with
its
surroundings
was
given
over
to
his
agent
at
truro
and
to
a
caretaker
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
had
once
seen
it
while
on
a
summer
tour
in
cornwall
five
years
before
a
great
square
keep
with
four
towers
and
forbidding
one
of
the
most
perfect
specimens
of
the
mediæval
castles
in
england
i
had
been
told
by
the
man
who
drove
the
hired
car
about
its
history
how
in
the
early
fourteenth
century
it
had
been
the
home
of
william
auberville
a
favourite
of
edward
ii
from
the
aubervilles
the
old
fortress
had
passed
a
century
later
into
the
weymount
family
and
had
been
their
ancestral
home
for
centuries
i
chanced
to
mention
that
i
had
seen
the
castle
whereupon
the
millionaire
smiled
and
remarked
i
fear
that
i
not
been
there
lately
i
am
so
very
seldom
in
england
nowadays
besides
the
old
place
is
so
cold
and
gloomy
it
is
draughty
even
on
a
summer
day
my
wife
liked
it
when
we
were
married
liked
it
until
somebody
told
her
of
a
family
legend
how
hugh
de
weymount
in
the
fifteenth
century
walled
up
his
wife
in
the
north
tower
and
left
her
to
starve
to
death
ever
since
she
heard
that
story
she
has
hated
the
old
place
but
he
added
with
a
hard
laugh
it
is
most
probably
not
true
and
if
the
gallant
knight
actually
did
such
a
thing
perhaps
after
all
the
lady
deserved
it
my
friend
certainly
seemed
soured
against
the
opposite
sex
and
surely
he
had
just
cause
to
be
if
his
wife
in
order
to
spite
him
had
deliberately
lost
the
heir
little
oswald
de
gex
in
westbourne
grove
it
was
a
strange
thing
that
the
heir
of
one
of
the
wealthiest
men
in
britain
should
have
been
abandoned
in
bayswater
as
a
bachelor
i
wondered
as
to
the
state
of
mind
of
the
mother
a
mother
who
could
take
out
her
child
on
a
winter
night
without
hat
or
coat
and
deliberately
cast
him
adrift
just
to
annoy
her
husband
but
the
gentler
sex
in
these
days
of
drugs
and
dancing
are
it
must
be
admitted
strangely
abnormal
women
with
crazes
abound
everywhere
that
women
are
emancipated
from
the
almost
oriental
thraldom
in
which
they
lived
in
the
days
of
victoria
the
good
is
a
bright
sign
of
our
times
the
times
of
discovery
refinement
and
mutual
happiness
of
all
classes
but
certain
circles
those
circles
wherein
women
take
drugs
to
enable
them
to
dance
the
better
circles
where
opium
is
smoked
and
where
morals
do
not
count
where
religion
is
scoffed
at
and
relegated
to
the
limbo
of
an
fiction
and
where
only
the
possessor
of
money
counts
there
is
a
strange
and
mysterious
phase
of
society
indescribable
by
the
pen
only
those
who
know
of
them
by
personal
experience
the
experience
of
fast
living
can
understand
it
and
even
the
stands
aghast
at
the
crazes
as
we
sat
chatting
in
that
quiet
comfortable
room
i
confess
that
i
became
rather
fascinated
by
my
host
perhaps
he
was
a
trifle
too
cynical
at
times
but
his
matrimonial
trouble
no
doubt
accounted
for
it
suddenly
he
rose
and
stretched
himself
rather
wearily
i
thought
the
thin
delicate
hand
which
held
his
cigar
was
long
and
tapering
and
upon
his
finger
was
an
antique
florentine
ring
in
the
form
of
a
small
emerald
moth
i
particularly
noticed
it
as
of
very
unusual
pattern
i
recollected
seeing
one
of
the
same
design
in
the
louvre
museum
in
paris
several
years
before
ah
he
sighed
i
shall
very
soon
leave
london
again
thank
goodness
next
week
i
return
to
fiesole
for
the
winter
i
am
no
great
lover
of
london
are
you
mr
garfield
my
business
as
an
electrical
engineer
keeps
me
in
london
was
my
reply
besides
i
have
recently
sustained
a
very
heavy
financial
loss
if
however
i
were
independent
i
should
certainly
live
in
the
country
london
has
to
me
become
unbearable
since
the
war
ah
i
quite
agree
replied
my
host
all
our
fine
british
traditions
seem
to
have
gone
by
the
board
that
at
least
is
my
own
view
but
there
perhaps
i
am
getting
an
old
fogey
i
do
think
so
i
replied
everyone
who
knows
you
de
gex
is
well
aware
of
your
and
your
great
generosity
are
they
he
asked
smiling
wearily
personally
i
care
very
little
popularity
and
prosperity
can
be
manufactured
by
any
shrewd
employed
at
so
much
a
year
without
publicity
the
professional
man
or
woman
would
never
obtain
a
hearing
these
are
the
days
when
incompetency
properly
boomed
raises
the
incompetent
to
greatness
and
even
to
cabinet
rank
neither
would
the
society
woman
ever
obtain
a
friend
without
her
boom
he
went
on
bah
i
sick
of
it
all
he
added
with
a
sweep
of
his
thin
white
hand
but
it
is
refreshing
to
talk
with
you
a
stranger
he
was
certainly
frank
in
his
criticisms
and
i
was
not
at
all
surprised
when
he
commenced
to
question
me
as
to
my
profession
where
i
lived
and
what
were
my
future
plans
i
told
him
quite
openly
of
my
position
and
that
i
lived
in
rivermead
mansions
with
my
friend
hambledon
and
i
also
mentioned
again
the
financial
blow
i
had
just
received
well
he
said
lazily
i
greatly
indebted
to
you
garfield
for
deigning
to
come
in
and
see
a
man
ah
you
do
not
know
how
i
suffer
from
my
wife
hatred
of
me
my
poor
little
oswald
fancy
abandoning
him
in
order
that
the
police
might
find
him
but
happily
he
is
back
think
of
the
publicity
for
the
papers
would
have
been
full
of
my
son
being
lost
then
after
a
pause
he
added
i
hope
we
shall
see
each
other
again
before
i
go
back
to
italy
at
that
moment
the
butler
horton
entered
with
a
card
upon
a
silver
salver
whereupon
i
rose
to
leave
oh
do
go
yet
my
host
urged
quickly
as
he
glanced
at
the
card
is
he
waiting
asked
de
gex
turning
to
his
servant
yes
sir
oh
well
yes
i
see
him
he
said
and
then
excusing
himself
he
rose
and
left
followed
by
the
man
why
i
wondered
had
i
been
invited
there
it
seemed
curious
that
this
exceedingly
rich
man
was
bursting
to
confide
his
domestic
troubles
to
a
perfect
stranger
i
glanced
around
the
handsome
room
upon
the
lay
a
number
of
letters
and
upon
the
red
was
a
big
wad
of
treasury
notes
under
an
elastic
band
cast
aside
heedlessly
as
rich
men
often
do
as
i
sat
there
awaiting
my
host
return
i
recollected
how
in
the
previous
year
i
had
seen
in
the
pictorial
press
photographs
of
the
handsome
de
gex
attired
in
jersey
and
breeches
with
knitted
cap
and
big
woollen
scarf
lying
upon
her
stomach
on
a
sleigh
on
the
cresta
run
in
another
photograph
which
i
recollected
she
was
watching
some
and
still
another
when
she
was
walking
in
the
park
with
a
cabinet
minister
and
his
wife
but
her
husband
never
appeared
in
print
one
of
his
idiosyncrasies
was
that
he
would
never
allow
himself
to
be
photographed
at
the
end
of
the
room
i
noticed
for
the
first
time
a
pair
of
heavy
oaken
communicating
with
the
adjoining
apartment
and
as
i
sat
there
i
fancied
i
heard
a
woman
shrill
but
refined
voice
the
voice
of
a
young
woman
followed
by
a
peal
of
light
almost
hysterical
laughter
in
which
a
man
joined
my
adventure
was
certainly
a
strange
one
i
had
started
out
to
visit
my
prosaic
old
uncle
as
i
so
often
did
and
i
had
anticipated
a
very
boring
time
but
here
i
was
by
a
most
curious
circumstance
upon
friendly
terms
with
one
of
the
richest
men
in
england
further
he
seemed
to
have
taken
an
unusual
fancy
to
me
probably
because
i
had
been
sympathetic
regarding
the
rescue
of
little
oswald
de
gex
but
why
he
should
have
confided
all
this
to
me
i
failed
to
realize
as
i
sat
there
by
the
cheerful
fire
i
heard
the
voices
again
raised
in
the
adjoining
room
the
voices
of
a
man
and
a
woman
suddenly
a
sweet
perfume
greeted
my
nostrils
at
first
it
seemed
like
that
of
an
of
lavender
verbena
and
basalt
such
as
our
grandmothers
decocted
in
their
from
dried
to
give
their
rooms
a
sweet
odour
the
scent
reminded
me
of
my
mother
of
long
ago
gradually
it
became
more
and
more
pungent
it
seemed
as
though
some
pastille
were
burning
somewhere
for
soon
it
became
almost
sickening
an
odour
utterly
overbearing
at
the
same
time
i
felt
a
curious
sensation
creeping
over
me
why
i
could
not
tell
i
was
both
agitated
and
annoyed
i
had
only
half
finished
my
drink
and
it
was
certainly
not
alcohol
that
was
affecting
me
rather
it
seemed
to
be
that
curious
perfume
which
each
moment
grew
more
pungent
i
struggled
against
it
what
would
my
friend
think
if
he
returned
to
find
me
overcome
i
gained
my
feet
with
difficulty
and
managed
to
walk
across
the
carpet
holding
my
breath
certainly
my
night
adventure
was
to
say
the
least
a
curious
one
yet
in
our
days
in
london
the
man
who
ventures
about
town
after
dark
can
easily
meet
with
as
strange
occurrences
and
narrow
escapes
as
ever
were
described
by
the
pioneers
of
central
africa
the
explorer
stanley
himself
declared
that
the
african
jungle
was
safer
than
the
crossing
of
the
strand
i
suppose
i
must
have
remained
in
the
chair
into
which
i
again
sank
for
a
further
ten
minutes
my
head
swam
my
mental
balance
seemed
to
have
become
strangely
upset
by
that
highly
pungent
odour
of
lavender
and
verbena
i
could
even
taste
it
upon
my
tongue
and
somehow
it
seemed
to
paralyse
all
my
senses
save
two
those
of
sight
and
reason
i
had
difficulty
in
moving
my
mouth
my
fingers
and
my
shoulders
but
my
sense
of
smell
seemed
to
have
become
extremely
acute
yet
my
muscles
seemed
rigid
although
my
brain
remained
perfectly
clear
and
unimpaired
it
was
that
scent
of
verbena
now
terrible
and
detestable
a
million
times
more
potent
than
any
bath
soap
which
filled
my
nostrils
so
that
it
seemed
to
choke
me
i
longed
for
fresh
air
by
dint
of
persistent
effort
i
rose
dragged
myself
across
the
room
drew
aside
the
heavy
silken
curtain
and
opening
the
window
leaned
out
into
the
cold
air
gasping
for
breath
where
was
de
gex
for
about
five
minutes
i
remained
there
yet
even
the
night
air
gave
me
little
relief
my
throat
had
become
contracted
until
i
seemed
to
be
choking
by
the
exercise
of
greater
effort
i
staggered
back
aghast
at
the
sudden
and
unaccountable
attack
and
pressed
the
electric
bell
beside
the
fireplace
to
summon
my
host
or
the
estimable
horton
then
i
sank
back
into
the
my
limbs
paralysed
how
long
i
remained
there
i
can
not
tell
for
that
pungent
odour
had
at
last
dulled
my
brain
i
had
heard
of
cocaine
of
opium
and
of
other
drugs
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
be
under
the
influence
of
one
or
the
other
of
them
yet
the
idea
was
absurd
i
was
de
guest
and
i
could
only
suppose
that
my
sudden
seizure
was
due
to
natural
causes
to
some
complication
of
a
mental
nature
which
i
had
never
suspected
the
human
brain
is
a
very
complex
composition
and
its
strange
vagaries
are
only
known
to
alienists
i
seemed
stifled
and
i
sat
clutching
the
arms
of
the
big
leather
chair
when
my
host
at
last
entered
smiling
serenely
and
full
of
apologies
i
awfully
sorry
to
have
left
you
garfield
but
my
agent
called
to
do
some
very
urgent
business
pray
excuse
me
wo
you
i
i
awfully
sorry
i
exclaimed
but
i
i
do
feel
very
well
i
must
apologize
de
gex
but
would
you
ask
your
man
to
order
me
a
taxi
i
well
i
come
over
strangely
queer
since
you
been
out
bah
my
dear
fellow
he
laughed
cheerily
you
surely
be
all
right
in
a
few
minutes
stay
here
and
rest
i
sorry
you
do
feel
well
you
be
better
soon
i
order
my
car
to
take
you
home
in
half
an
hour
then
he
crossed
to
the
telephone
rang
up
a
number
and
ordered
his
car
to
be
at
the
house
in
half
an
hour
then
he
rang
for
horton
who
brought
me
a
liqueur
glass
of
old
brandy
which
at
my
host
suggestion
i
swallowed
de
gex
standing
upon
the
thick
turkey
hearthrug
with
his
cigar
between
his
lips
watched
me
closely
apparently
he
was
considerably
perturbed
at
my
sudden
illness
for
he
expressed
regret
hoping
that
the
brandy
would
revive
me
it
however
had
the
opposite
effect
the
strong
perfume
like
had
confused
my
senses
but
the
brandy
dulled
them
still
further
i
felt
inert
and
unable
to
move
a
muscle
or
even
to
exercise
my
will
power
yet
my
sense
of
sight
was
quite
unimpaired
i
recollect
distinctly
how
the
dark
man
stood
before
me
alert
and
eager
as
he
gazed
intently
into
my
face
as
though
watching
the
progress
of
my
seizure
which
had
so
completely
paralysed
me
of
a
sudden
a
loud
shriek
sounded
from
the
adjoining
room
a
wild
shriek
of
terror
my
host
thin
lips
tightened
the
scream
was
repeated
and
continued
excuse
me
he
exclaimed
as
he
left
the
room
hastily
i
sat
with
ears
alert
it
was
surely
most
strange
that
the
millionaire
whose
name
was
on
everyone
lips
had
confided
in
me
as
he
had
done
why
had
he
done
so
the
screams
of
terror
continued
for
about
half
a
minute
then
they
seemed
stifled
down
to
heavy
sobbing
they
seemed
to
be
hysterical
sobs
as
of
someone
who
had
suffered
from
some
great
shock
i
was
full
of
wonderment
it
was
unusual
i
thought
that
such
noises
should
be
heard
in
a
sedate
west
end
mansion
there
was
a
sob
and
then
silence
a
dead
silence
a
few
moments
later
de
gex
came
in
looking
very
flushed
and
excited
my
troubles
are
ever
on
the
increase
he
exclaimed
breathlessly
come
garfield
come
with
me
he
assisted
me
to
my
feet
and
led
me
out
into
the
corridor
and
into
the
adjoining
room
to
my
surprise
it
was
a
great
handsomely
furnished
bedroom
with
heavy
hangings
of
yellow
silk
before
the
windows
and
a
great
with
a
huge
mirror
with
side
wings
along
one
side
were
wardrobes
built
into
the
wall
the
doors
being
of
satinwood
beautifully
inlaid
in
the
centre
stood
a
handsome
bed
and
upon
it
lay
a
young
and
beautiful
girl
wearing
a
dark
blue
serge
walking
dress
of
the
latest
mode
her
hat
was
off
and
across
her
dark
hair
was
a
band
of
black
velvet
the
light
shining
upon
her
white
face
a
countenance
which
has
ever
since
been
photographed
upon
my
memory
left
the
remainder
of
the
room
in
my
poor
niece
de
gex
said
breathlessly
she
she
has
been
subject
to
fits
of
hysteria
the
doctor
has
warned
her
of
her
heart
you
heard
her
cries
i
i
believe
she
dead
we
both
moved
to
the
bed
my
host
still
supporting
me
i
bent
cautiously
and
listened
but
i
could
hear
no
sound
of
breathing
her
heart
has
ceased
to
beat
he
took
a
hand
mirror
from
the
and
held
it
over
her
mouth
when
he
withdrew
it
it
remained
unclouded
she
dead
he
exclaimed
and
well
i
am
in
despair
first
my
wife
defies
me
and
now
poor
gabrielle
is
dead
how
would
you
feel
i
really
do
know
i
whispered
come
back
with
me
into
the
library
he
urged
we
ca
speak
here
i
well
i
want
to
be
perfectly
frank
with
you
and
he
conducted
me
back
to
the
room
where
we
had
been
seated
together
i
had
resumed
my
seat
much
puzzled
and
excited
by
the
tragedy
that
had
occurred
the
sudden
death
of
my
host
niece
now
look
here
exclaimed
de
gex
standing
upon
the
hearthrug
his
sallow
face
pale
and
drawn
your
presence
here
is
most
opportune
you
must
render
me
assistance
in
this
unfortunate
affair
garfield
i
feel
that
i
can
trust
you
and
i
well
i
hope
you
can
trust
me
in
return
will
you
consent
to
help
me
in
what
way
i
asked
i
in
a
hole
a
desperate
hole
he
said
very
anxiously
poor
gabrielle
has
died
but
if
it
gets
out
that
her
death
is
sudden
then
there
must
be
a
coroner
inquiry
with
all
its
publicity
photographs
in
the
and
perhaps
all
sorts
of
mud
cast
at
me
i
want
to
avoid
all
this
and
you
alone
can
help
me
how
i
inquired
much
perturbed
by
the
tragic
occurrence
by
giving
a
death
certificate
but
i
not
a
doctor
you
can
pass
as
one
he
said
looking
very
straight
at
me
besides
it
is
so
easy
for
you
to
write
out
a
certificate
and
sign
it
with
a
change
of
your
christian
name
there
is
a
gordon
garfield
in
the
list
wo
you
do
it
for
me
and
help
me
out
of
a
very
great
difficulty
do
i
implore
you
he
urged
but
i
i
please
do
not
hesitate
you
have
only
to
give
the
certificate
here
is
pen
and
paper
and
here
is
a
blank
form
my
niece
died
of
heart
disease
for
which
you
have
attended
her
several
times
during
the
past
six
months
i
certainly
have
not
no
he
replied
grinning
i
am
aware
of
that
but
surely
five
thousand
pounds
is
easily
earned
by
writing
out
a
certificate
write
it
you
only
just
copy
it
and
he
bent
and
scribbled
some
words
upon
a
slip
of
paper
five
thousand
pounds
it
was
a
tempting
offer
in
face
of
the
fact
that
i
had
just
lost
practically
a
similar
sum
but
how
do
i
know
that
miss
miss
engledue
he
said
well
how
do
i
know
that
miss
engledue
has
not
well
has
not
met
with
foul
play
i
asked
you
do
my
dear
sir
that
i
admit
yet
you
surely
do
not
suspect
me
of
murdering
my
niece
the
girl
i
have
brought
up
as
my
own
daughter
and
he
laughed
grimly
five
thousand
pounds
is
a
decent
sum
he
added
and
in
this
case
you
can
very
easily
earn
it
by
posing
as
a
medical
man
i
remarked
a
very
serious
offence
again
my
host
smiled
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
well
he
said
after
a
pause
here
is
the
certificate
for
you
to
copy
reject
my
offer
if
you
like
but
i
think
you
must
agree
that
it
is
a
most
generous
one
to
me
money
is
but
little
object
my
only
concern
is
the
annoying
publicity
which
a
coroner
inquiry
must
bring
i
confess
that
i
was
wavering
the
shrewd
clever
man
at
once
realized
the
position
and
again
he
conducted
me
to
the
chamber
where
the
young
girl
was
lying
cold
and
still
i
shall
ever
recollect
that
beautiful
face
white
and
cold
like
chiselled
marble
it
seemed
for
was
apparently
already
setting
in
back
again
in
the
library
oswald
de
gex
took
from
his
safe
a
bundle
of
bank
of
england
notes
and
counted
them
out
fifty
of
them
he
held
them
in
his
hand
with
a
sheet
of
blank
notepaper
bearing
an
address
in
queen
anne
street
cavendish
square
and
a
blank
form
thus
he
tempted
me
and
and
at
last
i
fell
when
i
had
written
and
signed
the
certificate
he
handed
me
the
bundle
of
notes
i
now
remember
that
at
that
moment
he
took
some
pastilles
from
his
pocket
and
placed
one
in
his
mouth
i
thought
perhaps
they
were
throat
lozenges
of
a
sudden
however
the
atmosphere
seemed
to
be
overpoweringly
oppressive
with
the
odour
of
heliotrope
it
seemed
a
house
of
subtle
perfumes
the
effect
upon
me
was
that
of
delirious
intoxication
i
could
hear
nothing
and
i
could
think
of
nothing
my
senses
were
entirely
confused
and
i
became
utterly
dazed
what
did
it
all
mean
i
only
know
that
i
placed
the
wad
of
bank
notes
in
the
inner
pocket
of
my
waistcoat
and
that
i
was
talking
to
the
millionaire
when
of
a
sudden
my
brain
felt
as
though
it
had
suddenly
become
frozen
the
scent
of
verbena
became
nauseating
even
intoxicating
but
upon
oswald
de
gex
who
was
still
munching
his
pastille
the
odour
apparently
had
no
effect
all
i
recollect
further
is
that
i
sank
suddenly
into
a
big
while
my
host
face
grinned
demoniacally
in
complete
satisfaction
i
slowly
lapsed
into
blank
unconsciousness
little
did
i
at
the
time
dream
with
what
amazing
cleverness
the
trap
into
which
i
had
fallen
had
been
baited
but
what
happened
to
me
further
i
will
endeavour
to
describe
to
you
chapter
the
second
the
sister
story
a
strange
sensation
crept
over
me
for
i
suddenly
felt
that
my
brain
dazed
by
that
subtle
odour
of
was
slowly
unclouding
ever
so
slowly
until
to
my
amazement
i
found
myself
seated
upon
a
garden
chair
on
a
long
veranda
which
overlooked
a
sloping
garden
with
the
sunlit
sea
beyond
of
the
lapse
of
time
i
have
no
idea
to
this
day
nor
have
i
any
knowledge
of
what
happened
to
me
all
i
am
able
to
relate
is
the
fact
that
i
found
myself
in
overcoat
and
hat
seated
upon
a
long
terrace
in
the
noon
sunlight
of
winter
i
gazed
around
utterly
astonished
the
clothes
i
wore
seemed
coarse
and
unfamiliar
my
hand
went
to
my
chin
when
i
found
that
i
had
grown
a
beard
my
surroundings
were
strange
and
mysterious
the
houses
on
either
side
were
white
and
inartistic
with
sloping
roofs
and
square
windows
they
were
foreign
evidently
french
the
shrill
siren
of
a
factory
sounded
somewhere
releasing
the
workers
far
away
before
me
a
steamer
away
on
the
horizon
left
a
long
trail
of
smoke
behind
while
here
and
there
showed
the
brown
sails
of
fishing
boats
i
rose
from
my
seat
filled
with
curiosity
and
glanced
at
the
house
before
which
i
stood
it
was
a
big
square
building
of
red
brick
with
many
square
windows
it
seemed
like
a
hospital
or
institution
that
it
was
the
former
was
quickly
revealed
for
a
few
moments
after
i
had
risen
a
in
a
linen
appeared
and
spoke
kindly
to
me
asking
in
french
how
i
felt
on
that
glorious
morning
i
am
quite
all
right
was
my
reply
in
french
but
where
am
i
i
inquired
utterly
dazed
never
mind
where
you
are
replied
the
stout
woman
in
blue
uniform
and
broad
collar
you
have
only
to
get
better
but
i
am
better
i
protested
i
lost
consciousness
in
london
and
now
i
awake
here
to
find
myself
where
you
are
in
good
hands
so
why
trouble
asked
the
sister
very
kindly
you
are
upset
i
know
do
not
worry
take
things
quite
easily
do
not
try
to
recall
the
past
the
past
i
cried
what
has
passed
eh
what
has
happened
since
i
went
through
stretton
street
the
other
night
the
sister
smiled
at
me
she
seemed
inclined
to
humour
me
as
she
would
a
child
do
not
perturb
yourself
i
beg
of
you
she
said
in
a
sympathetic
voice
there
is
really
no
need
for
it
only
just
remain
calm
and
all
will
be
right
but
you
do
not
explain
sister
i
said
why
am
i
here
and
where
am
i
i
asked
gazing
vacantly
around
me
you
are
with
friends
friends
who
have
looked
after
you
was
her
reply
we
are
all
very
sorry
for
your
motor
accident
motor
accident
i
echoed
i
have
had
no
motor
accident
again
the
woman
smiled
in
disbelief
and
it
annoyed
me
indeed
it
goaded
me
to
anger
but
you
told
us
all
about
it
how
you
started
out
from
the
quay
at
boulogne
late
at
night
to
drive
to
abbeville
and
how
your
hired
chauffeur
held
you
up
and
left
you
at
the
roadside
she
said
yet
the
curious
fact
about
your
strange
story
is
the
money
money
what
money
i
gasped
utterly
astounded
by
the
remark
the
money
they
found
upon
you
a
packet
of
bank
notes
the
police
have
the
five
thousand
pounds
in
english
money
i
believe
the
police
why
i
asked
no
she
said
smiling
and
still
humouring
me
as
though
i
were
a
child
do
bother
about
it
now
you
are
a
little
better
we
will
talk
of
it
all
but
where
am
i
i
demanded
still
bewildered
you
are
in
malo
was
her
slow
reply
st
malo
i
echoed
how
did
i
get
here
i
have
no
remembrance
of
it
of
course
you
have
not
replied
the
kindly
woman
in
the
you
are
only
just
recovering
from
what
from
loss
of
memory
and
well
the
doctors
say
you
have
suffered
from
a
complete
nervous
breakdown
i
was
aghast
scarce
believing
myself
to
be
in
my
senses
and
at
the
same
time
wondering
if
it
were
not
all
a
dream
but
no
gradually
all
the
events
of
that
night
in
stretton
street
arose
before
me
i
saw
them
again
in
every
detail
oswald
de
gex
his
servant
horton
and
the
dead
girl
pale
but
very
beautiful
as
she
lay
with
closed
eyes
upon
her
i
recollected
too
the
certificate
i
had
given
for
payment
those
notes
which
the
police
held
in
safe
custody
the
whole
adventure
seemed
a
hideous
nightmare
and
yet
it
was
all
so
real
but
how
did
i
come
to
be
in
malo
how
did
i
travel
from
london
sister
i
said
presently
what
is
the
date
of
the
eleventh
of
december
she
replied
the
affair
at
stretton
street
had
occurred
on
the
night
of
november
over
a
month
before
and
how
long
have
i
been
here
nearly
three
weeks
was
her
answer
was
it
really
possible
that
i
had
been
lost
for
the
previous
ten
days
or
so
i
tried
to
obtain
some
further
facts
from
my
nurse
but
she
refused
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
i
have
been
ordered
by
the
doctors
to
keep
you
very
quiet
she
said
please
do
not
ask
me
to
break
my
promise
you
will
be
much
better
and
they
will
tell
you
everything
but
mine
is
a
strange
case
is
it
not
i
asked
very
strange
she
admitted
we
have
all
been
much
puzzled
concerning
you
then
why
not
tell
me
all
the
circumstances
now
why
keep
me
in
suspense
i
urged
because
you
have
not
yet
quite
recovered
you
are
not
entirely
yourself
come
she
added
kindly
let
us
take
a
little
walk
it
will
do
you
good
for
the
weather
is
so
lovely
at
her
suggestion
i
strolled
by
her
side
through
the
pleasant
grounds
of
the
hospital
down
into
malo
the
busy
streets
of
which
were
however
entirely
unfamiliar
to
me
yet
according
to
the
sister
i
had
walked
in
them
a
number
of
times
before
still
i
had
no
recollection
of
doing
so
i
am
taking
you
for
your
favourite
stroll
she
said
as
we
went
down
one
of
the
steep
tortuous
streets
to
the
little
place
châteaubriand
in
front
of
the
ancient
castle
which
she
told
me
was
now
a
barracks
presently
she
mounted
to
the
ramparts
and
as
we
strolled
round
them
i
admired
the
beautiful
view
of
the
sea
the
many
islets
and
the
curious
appearance
of
the
town
the
tide
was
up
and
the
view
on
that
sunny
december
morning
was
glorious
at
one
point
where
we
halted
my
nurse
pointed
out
the
little
summer
town
of
dinard
and
enogat
and
told
me
the
names
of
the
various
islets
rising
from
the
sea
les
herbiers
the
grand
jardin
la
conchée
and
all
the
rest
but
i
walked
those
ramparts
like
a
man
in
a
dream
a
new
life
had
in
that
past
hour
opened
up
to
me
what
had
occurred
since
i
had
accepted
that
bundle
of
bank
notes
from
the
millionaire
hand
i
did
not
know
i
had
emerged
from
the
darkness
of
unconsciousness
into
the
knowledge
of
things
about
me
and
found
myself
amid
surroundings
which
i
had
never
before
known
in
a
french
hospital
where
they
evidently
viewed
me
as
an
interesting
case
i
stood
against
the
wall
and
gazed
about
my
habit
was
to
carry
my
in
my
upper
waistcoat
pocket
instinctively
i
felt
for
it
and
it
was
there
it
was
not
my
own
silver
case
but
a
big
nickel
one
yet
in
it
there
were
some
of
my
own
brand
i
looked
inquiringly
at
my
nurse
she
smiled
saying
you
have
many
left
why
ca
you
smoke
some
other
brand
you
always
insist
upon
that
one
i
had
so
much
difficulty
in
getting
them
for
you
yesterday
they
are
my
own
particular
fancy
i
said
tapping
one
of
them
upon
the
case
before
lighting
it
i
know
but
here
in
france
they
are
most
difficult
to
get
the
other
day
you
said
you
had
smoked
them
all
through
the
war
and
even
when
you
were
in
italy
you
had
had
them
sent
out
to
you
from
london
that
was
quite
correct
well
sister
i
laughed
i
have
no
recollection
of
saying
that
but
it
is
perfectly
true
it
seems
that
only
this
morning
i
regained
consciousness
professor
thillot
said
you
would
others
gave
you
up
but
he
declared
that
after
careful
nursing
your
memory
would
regain
its
normal
balance
who
is
professor
thillot
the
great
nerve
specialist
of
paris
the
police
engaged
him
to
come
to
see
you
he
was
here
ten
days
ago
and
he
put
you
under
my
charge
i
laughed
then
i
am
still
an
interesting
case
sister
eh
yes
you
certainly
are
but
do
tell
me
more
of
what
i
am
in
ignorance
i
implored
i
want
to
know
how
i
came
here
in
france
when
i
lost
all
consciousness
in
a
house
just
off
park
lane
in
london
she
said
firmly
but
kindly
she
was
a
charming
woman
whose
name
she
gave
me
as
soeur
marie
we
strolled
back
to
the
hospital
but
on
the
way
along
the
quai
i
noticed
it
written
up
i
became
again
confused
my
vision
was
not
as
it
should
have
been
and
my
memory
seemed
blurred
even
of
the
happenings
of
the
past
hour
my
nurse
chatted
as
we
walked
together
through
the
streets
but
i
know
that
my
answers
were
unintelligible
i
felt
i
was
not
myself
all
my
senses
were
keen
as
far
as
i
could
gauge
all
save
that
of
my
memory
of
the
past
as
i
ascended
through
the
pretty
grounds
of
the
hospital
the
sister
beside
me
i
felt
a
curious
failing
of
my
heart
i
experienced
a
sensation
which
i
can
not
here
describe
as
of
one
who
had
lost
all
interest
in
life
and
who
longed
for
death
there
may
be
some
among
my
readers
who
have
experienced
it
perhaps
i
can
not
describe
it
i
merely
explain
that
i
felt
inert
inefficient
and
bored
with
life
no
such
feeling
had
ever
fallen
upon
me
before
hitherto
i
had
been
quick
alert
and
full
of
the
enjoyment
of
living
at
rivermead
mansions
harry
hambledon
and
i
had
prided
ourselves
on
our
alertness
where
was
harry
what
was
he
doing
would
he
be
wondering
why
i
was
absent
from
our
riparian
bachelor
home
i
was
reflecting
upon
all
this
when
suddenly
without
any
apparent
cause
i
once
more
lost
consciousness
we
were
at
that
moment
entering
the
door
of
the
hospital
and
the
sister
had
just
exclaimed
now
do
remain
quite
quiet
and
not
worry
over
the
past
it
will
all
be
right
she
urged
i
know
not
what
words
i
uttered
in
reply
a
curious
sense
of
oppression
had
fallen
upon
me
a
hot
burning
feeling
as
though
my
skull
was
filled
with
molten
metal
while
at
the
back
of
my
neck
was
a
sharp
excruciating
pain
which
caused
me
to
hold
my
breath
the
sister
apparently
noticed
my
sudden
relapse
for
she
expressed
a
hope
that
i
was
not
feeling
worse
i
tried
to
reassure
her
that
i
was
all
right
but
i
know
i
failed
to
do
so
for
once
again
i
lost
all
knowledge
of
things
about
me
after
that
i
recollect
nothing
more
probably
i
walked
on
mechanically
back
to
my
bed
when
my
lapse
had
passed
and
i
again
regained
consciousness
i
found
myself
in
bed
gazing
up
at
the
ceiling
on
either
side
of
me
were
men
also
in
bed
they
were
talking
in
french
i
listened
and
in
a
few
seconds
i
recollected
the
events
of
the
previous
day
then
a
nurse
whom
i
had
not
seen
before
told
us
it
was
time
to
dress
i
obeyed
but
my
clothes
were
entirely
unfamiliar
they
were
coarse
and
did
not
fit
me
while
i
washed
i
burst
out
laughing
the
humour
of
the
situation
struck
me
as
distinctly
amusing
at
one
hour
i
was
myself
at
the
next
i
was
another
being
was
my
case
that
of
jekyll
and
hyde
i
knew
and
i
felt
keenly
about
it
that
i
had
accepted
a
bribe
to
perform
an
illicit
service
i
had
posed
as
a
medical
man
and
given
a
certificate
of
death
but
my
one
and
only
object
in
life
was
to
see
de
gex
and
demand
of
him
a
full
explanation
of
the
amazing
and
suspicious
circumstances
my
lapses
were
intermittent
at
times
i
was
fully
conscious
of
the
past
at
others
my
brain
was
awhirl
and
aflame
i
could
think
of
nothing
see
nothing
only
distorted
visions
of
things
about
me
apparently
hours
had
passed
since
i
walked
in
the
sunshine
the
men
in
the
hospital
ward
were
all
frenchmen
apparently
of
the
lower
class
at
one
end
of
the
room
a
heated
argument
was
in
progress
in
which
four
or
five
men
were
gesticulating
and
wrangling
while
one
man
was
seated
on
his
bed
laughing
idiotically
it
seemed
at
his
own
thoughts
presently
a
tall
thin
man
in
spectacles
entered
and
addressing
me
asked
me
to
follow
him
i
obeyed
and
he
conducted
me
to
a
small
kind
of
office
in
which
two
men
were
standing
both
were
and
of
official
aspect
having
given
me
a
chair
they
all
seated
themselves
when
the
thin
man
who
i
rightly
judged
to
be
the
director
of
the
hospital
commenced
to
interrogate
me
how
do
you
feel
was
his
first
question
which
he
put
in
french
in
a
quiet
kindly
manner
i
feel
much
better
was
my
reply
but
yesterday
my
nurse
revealed
to
me
some
very
extraordinary
facts
concerning
myself
yes
you
have
been
seriously
ill
he
said
but
now
you
are
better
these
gentlemen
wish
to
put
a
few
questions
to
you
they
are
police
officers
i
presume
the
director
nodded
in
the
affirmative
we
wish
to
ascertain
exactly
what
happened
to
you
monsieur
exclaimed
the
elder
of
the
pair
i
really
do
know
i
replied
i
must
have
lost
all
consciousness
in
london
and
in
london
exclaimed
monsieur
leullier
the
prefect
of
police
in
great
surprise
then
how
came
you
here
in
st
malo
i
have
not
the
slightest
idea
was
my
reply
i
only
presume
that
i
was
found
here
you
were
a
passing
along
the
quay
vincent
at
about
two
in
the
morning
found
you
seated
on
the
ground
with
your
back
to
the
wall
moaning
as
though
in
pain
he
called
the
police
and
you
were
removed
on
the
ambulance
to
the
hospital
here
the
doctors
found
that
you
were
in
no
pain
but
that
you
could
give
no
intelligible
account
of
yourself
what
did
i
tell
them
oh
a
number
of
silly
stories
at
one
moment
you
said
you
had
come
from
italy
then
you
said
that
you
had
hired
a
and
the
driver
had
attacked
you
in
the
night
afterwards
you
believed
yourself
to
be
in
some
office
and
talked
about
electrical
engineering
that
is
my
profession
i
said
and
i
told
them
my
name
and
my
address
in
london
facts
which
the
police
carefully
set
down
you
told
us
that
your
name
was
henry
aitken
and
that
you
lived
mostly
in
italy
at
some
place
near
rome
we
have
made
inquiries
by
telegraph
of
a
number
of
people
whom
you
have
mentioned
but
all
their
replies
have
been
in
the
negative
said
the
police
official
well
i
am
now
entirely
in
possession
of
my
full
senses
i
declared
but
how
i
got
to
france
i
have
not
the
slightest
knowledge
i
lost
consciousness
in
a
house
in
stretton
street
in
london
since
then
i
have
known
nothing
until
yesterday
in
what
circumstances
did
you
lapse
into
unconsciousness
asked
the
doctor
looking
intently
at
me
through
his
glasses
for
mine
was
no
doubt
an
extremely
interesting
case
what
do
you
remember
did
you
receive
any
sudden
shock
i
explained
that
being
on
a
visit
to
a
friend
as
i
designated
oswald
de
gex
his
niece
died
very
suddenly
and
after
that
i
became
unconscious
the
prefect
of
police
naturally
became
very
inquisitive
but
i
preferred
not
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
my
intention
was
to
return
to
london
and
demand
from
de
gex
a
full
explanation
of
what
had
actually
occurred
on
that
fatal
night
i
was
full
of
suspicion
regarding
the
sudden
death
of
his
niece
gabrielle
engledue
the
police
official
told
me
that
from
my
clothes
all
the
tabs
bearing
the
tailor
name
had
been
removed
and
also
the
laundry
marks
from
my
underclothes
there
was
nothing
upon
me
that
could
possibly
establish
my
identity
though
in
my
pocket
was
found
five
thousand
pounds
in
bank
notes
which
he
handed
to
me
they
were
intact
the
same
notes
which
de
gex
has
given
me
in
return
for
the
false
death
certificate
i
had
signed
i
sat
utterly
aghast
at
the
story
of
my
discovery
of
the
many
attempts
made
to
establish
my
identity
of
the
visit
of
the
british
to
the
hospital
and
of
his
kindness
towards
me
it
seemed
that
he
had
questioned
me
closely
but
i
had
told
an
utterly
fantastic
story
indeed
as
i
sat
there
i
felt
that
neither
of
my
three
interrogators
believed
a
single
word
of
the
truth
i
related
yet
after
all
i
was
not
revealing
the
whole
truth
certain
recollections
which
i
would
have
forgotten
came
to
me
i
had
i
knew
committed
a
very
serious
criminal
offence
in
posing
as
a
medical
man
and
giving
that
death
certificate
possibly
i
had
been
an
accessory
to
some
great
crime
the
crime
of
murder
that
thought
held
me
anxious
and
filled
me
with
fear
the
prefect
of
police
seemed
entirely
dissatisfied
with
my
explanation
nevertheless
he
was
compelled
to
accept
it
and
an
hour
later
i
was
released
from
the
hospital
before
leaving
however
i
was
shown
the
register
in
which
i
had
signed
my
name
as
henry
aitken
this
i
erased
and
substituted
my
own
name
then
i
thanked
the
tall
thin
director
and
walked
out
into
the
streets
of
malo
a
changed
man
chapter
the
third
who
was
gabrielle
engledue
what
i
wondered
had
happened
during
my
month
of
unconsciousness
i
wandered
into
a
café
and
sat
pondering
afterwards
i
walked
about
the
town
aimlessly
and
rather
hungry
my
own
clothes
had
been
returned
to
me
but
before
i
assumed
them
i
saw
that
every
mark
of
identity
had
been
purposely
removed
even
the
trousers
buttons
which
had
borne
the
name
of
my
tailor
a
reputable
firm
in
new
bond
street
had
been
substituted
but
by
whom
on
the
following
afternoon
i
arrived
in
london
and
drove
straight
to
rivermead
mansions
i
entered
with
my
latchkey
and
on
glancing
around
saw
signs
that
my
friend
hambledon
was
still
living
there
the
fire
in
the
had
been
lit
by
the
kaiserin
ready
for
his
and
everything
seemed
bright
and
cosy
it
was
then
about
four
and
hambledon
would
certainly
not
return
till
six
therefore
after
a
good
wash
a
shave
and
a
clean
collar
i
set
forth
for
stretton
street
to
interview
oswald
de
gex
the
house
in
the
dusk
was
just
as
i
recollected
it
on
that
eventful
night
when
i
was
so
unexpectedly
called
inside
i
rang
the
bell
three
times
until
at
last
the
door
opened
and
a
tall
stalwart
man
appeared
i
inquired
for
de
gex
whereupon
he
replied
de
gex
is
in
italy
sir
oh
when
did
he
leave
town
about
a
month
ago
sir
the
man
answered
you
are
i
suppose
the
caretaker
i
asked
now
i
wonder
if
you
will
do
me
a
very
great
favour
you
may
think
me
a
thief
or
a
burglar
i
laughed
but
the
fact
is
i
have
a
great
desire
to
see
de
gex
house
i
heard
so
much
about
its
beauties
i
wonder
if
you
would
show
me
the
and
the
library
the
man
hesitated
saying
well
sir
i
no
orders
to
show
anyone
over
have
you
a
card
i
at
once
produced
one
from
my
and
added
that
i
was
a
personal
friend
of
the
millionaire
he
read
my
name
and
looked
again
at
me
i
assured
him
that
i
was
not
prospecting
with
a
view
to
burglary
i
only
asking
you
to
do
me
a
favour
i
went
on
and
i
put
a
couple
of
treasury
notes
into
his
hand
you
can
inquire
about
me
at
my
office
if
you
like
they
will
tell
you
i
expect
that
i
have
been
away
on
a
month
leave
the
little
no
doubt
propitiated
him
for
he
invited
me
in
then
he
switched
on
the
light
in
the
hall
and
as
he
did
so
said
i
do
know
what
trouble
i
get
into
with
the
master
he
a
very
eccentric
man
as
you
of
course
know
i
laughed
as
we
ascended
the
soft
carpeted
stairs
i
recollected
the
pattern
a
few
moments
later
we
were
in
the
library
yes
it
was
just
as
i
remembered
it
nothing
had
been
altered
there
was
the
whereon
i
had
copied
out
the
death
certificate
the
big
fireplace
now
empty
and
the
deep
chair
in
which
i
had
sat
there
was
the
window
too
the
window
which
i
had
opened
in
order
to
gasp
for
air
after
that
suffocating
odour
of
as
i
stood
there
the
watchful
caretaker
with
his
eye
upon
me
wondering
no
doubt
i
again
took
in
every
detail
my
return
held
me
more
than
ever
puzzled
what
is
the
room
beyond
i
asked
oh
that
the
mistress
bedroom
he
replied
a
curious
fancy
to
have
her
room
next
to
the
library
but
it
one
of
the
best
rooms
in
the
house
the
master
hates
london
he
lives
all
the
time
in
italy
and
is
only
over
here
just
for
a
week
or
two
in
spring
and
a
week
or
so
before
christmas
i
like
to
see
that
room
i
said
affecting
ignorance
he
took
me
in
in
a
second
i
saw
that
nothing
had
been
changed
since
i
had
stood
there
at
the
of
gabrielle
engledue
a
little
over
a
month
ago
there
was
the
handsome
with
its
inlaid
cupboards
its
great
and
its
fine
bed
the
bed
upon
which
the
beautiful
young
woman
had
been
lying
dead
but
now
the
bed
had
been
and
its
quilted
coverlet
of
pale
pink
silk
was
undisturbed
the
corpse
had
been
removed
and
buried
upon
my
certificate
i
sniffed
to
see
whether
i
could
detect
that
curious
odour
of
but
in
vain
the
air
seemed
fresh
and
not
stifling
as
it
had
been
on
that
night
upon
a
side
table
stood
a
large
photograph
in
a
silver
frame
i
bent
to
look
at
it
whereupon
the
caretaker
said
that
a
good
photograph
of
de
gex
is
it
sir
excellent
i
said
for
it
was
a
really
fine
portrait
does
your
mistress
come
over
from
italy
often
oh
yes
and
she
brings
the
little
boy
over
with
her
she
is
frequently
here
while
her
husband
stays
at
fiesole
i
send
on
his
correspondence
every
day
to
henderson
his
secretary
i
stood
gazing
around
the
room
upon
that
bed
the
beautiful
girl
lay
dead
and
i
had
certified
the
cause
of
her
death
yet
i
had
later
on
been
the
victim
of
some
devil
trick
of
which
i
knew
nothing
i
was
there
to
investigate
yet
though
i
questioned
the
caretaker
very
closely
i
confess
that
i
met
with
little
success
he
was
an
old
and
trusted
servant
of
the
family
hence
to
many
of
my
inquiries
he
remained
dumb
when
do
you
expect
your
master
back
i
asked
at
last
oh
not
for
another
six
months
or
so
where
is
de
gex
ah
that
i
ca
quite
make
out
he
replied
it
a
bit
of
a
mystery
one
night
she
went
away
quite
unexpectedly
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
nobody
knows
where
she
is
her
husband
does
know
or
pretends
he
does
he
said
with
a
knowing
grin
then
she
has
disappeared
i
exclaimed
that
just
it
and
they
were
always
such
a
devoted
pair
little
oswald
was
the
only
thing
she
lived
for
lived
i
echoed
then
do
you
think
she
dead
i
asked
quickly
dead
why
should
we
think
so
if
she
were
we
should
surely
have
seen
it
in
the
papers
but
your
master
has
very
funny
fits
sometimes
i
said
i
heard
about
his
eccentric
ways
of
course
he
has
he
overburdened
with
money
that
what
it
is
henderson
looks
after
all
his
affairs
de
gex
has
no
regard
for
money
henderson
attends
to
everything
phew
i
wish
i
were
a
millionaire
i
find
it
hard
enough
nowadays
to
pay
the
butcher
and
baker
and
make
both
ends
meet
and
so
do
i
i
said
laughing
but
tell
me
where
is
the
young
lady
who
used
to
live
here
de
gex
niece
his
niece
i
do
think
he
has
a
niece
miss
gabrielle
engledue
who
she
i
never
heard
of
her
was
the
man
reply
i
described
her
but
he
shook
his
head
to
my
knowledge
de
gex
has
got
a
niece
he
said
were
you
here
five
weeks
ago
i
inquired
five
weeks
ago
no
i
and
my
wife
went
away
down
to
swanage
to
see
her
sister
the
master
gave
us
a
fortnight
holiday
why
oh
nothing
i
replied
i
merely
inquired
as
i
want
to
clear
up
a
mystery
that
all
what
mystery
the
mystery
of
miss
engledue
your
master
niece
i
answered
but
i
never
heard
of
any
niece
he
said
a
young
lady
of
about
with
dark
hair
and
eyes
and
a
beautiful
complexion
i
said
but
the
old
servant
mind
was
a
blank
of
course
sir
many
people
come
to
visit
de
gex
horton
would
know
them
but
i
do
when
the
master
is
in
town
the
servants
are
here
and
i
down
in
cornwall
at
the
castle
then
you
are
only
here
as
caretaker
when
the
family
is
away
that
it
sir
he
said
but
what
is
the
mystery
about
this
young
lady
you
said
you
knew
de
gex
and
yet
you
wanted
to
look
over
the
house
yes
i
responded
with
a
laugh
i
have
my
own
object
to
clear
up
the
mystery
of
de
gex
niece
well
as
far
as
i
know
he
has
no
niece
but
you
could
easily
find
out
i
suppose
the
man
was
evidently
no
fool
of
course
i
do
know
who
comes
here
or
who
stays
here
when
the
family
is
in
town
he
went
on
i
simply
come
up
and
look
after
the
place
with
my
wife
then
you
were
away
in
swanage
during
the
first
week
of
november
i
asked
very
seriously
yes
we
went
down
on
the
last
day
of
october
and
we
were
back
here
in
the
middle
of
november
my
wife
sister
was
very
ill
and
her
husband
did
expect
her
to
live
so
i
remember
the
dates
only
too
well
then
the
family
were
in
town
on
the
date
i
mention
he
considered
a
moment
oh
of
course
they
were
they
must
have
been
i
glanced
again
around
the
room
full
of
amazement
and
wonder
the
man
failure
to
give
me
any
details
regarding
the
extremely
attractive
girl
who
had
died
upon
his
mistress
bed
held
me
gripped
in
uncertainty
the
mystery
was
even
more
puzzling
now
that
i
had
started
to
investigate
as
i
stood
in
that
room
a
thousand
strange
reflections
flashed
across
my
mind
why
had
i
a
mere
been
called
in
so
suddenly
to
be
taken
into
the
intimacy
of
the
millionaire
household
was
it
by
mere
accident
that
i
had
been
invited
in
or
was
it
by
careful
design
i
had
lost
five
thousand
pounds
by
foolish
speculation
and
yet
i
had
regained
it
by
being
party
to
a
criminal
offence
again
who
was
the
pretty
girl
who
had
first
uttered
those
hysterical
screams
and
then
while
fully
dressed
had
died
upon
de
gex
bed
further
if
the
mysterious
dead
girl
had
been
niece
of
the
millionaire
surely
my
friend
the
caretaker
would
have
known
her
i
confess
that
i
now
became
more
bewildered
than
ever
that
a
girl
named
gabrielle
engledue
whoever
she
might
have
been
had
died
and
that
i
had
forged
a
certificate
showing
the
cause
of
death
were
hard
solid
facts
but
the
mystery
of
it
all
was
complete
that
i
had
been
the
victim
of
some
very
carefully
prepared
and
subtle
plot
was
apparent
and
it
had
become
my
own
affair
to
investigate
it
and
bring
to
justice
those
who
were
responsible
for
the
poor
death
time
after
time
i
questioned
the
caretaker
regarding
the
existence
of
the
millionaire
niece
miss
engledue
but
it
was
plain
to
me
that
he
had
no
knowledge
of
any
such
person
was
there
not
a
death
in
this
house
about
five
weeks
ago
i
asked
death
he
echoed
why
no
sir
you
must
be
dreaming
if
there
had
been
a
death
while
i
was
away
either
my
wife
or
i
would
certainly
have
heard
about
it
and
he
looked
suspiciously
at
me
as
though
he
believed
i
had
taken
leave
of
my
senses
an
hour
later
i
was
back
at
rivermead
mansions
where
harry
for
whom
i
had
left
a
note
was
awaiting
me
as
we
sat
together
before
a
cheerful
fire
i
told
him
of
my
lapse
into
unconsciousness
of
my
loss
of
memory
but
i
did
not
explain
all
that
had
happened
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
had
no
desire
that
anyone
should
know
of
my
guilt
in
posing
as
a
medical
man
and
thus
becoming
implicated
in
the
mysterious
death
of
gabrielle
engledue
my
friend
sat
and
heard
me
smoking
his
pipe
in
silence
extraordinary
he
said
you
ought
to
go
to
the
police
garfield
you
were
doped
without
a
doubt
but
what
was
the
motive
i
been
very
worried
about
you
when
you
had
been
missing
a
week
they
sent
over
from
your
office
and
i
then
went
to
the
police
at
hammersmith
they
made
every
inquiry
and
circulated
your
description
but
they
could
discover
no
trace
of
you
i
have
to
report
that
you
been
found
yes
do
so
morning
i
urged
i
do
want
the
police
following
me
about
thank
you
and
i
laughed
rather
grimly
perhaps
during
the
hours
that
i
lay
awake
that
night
a
thought
suddenly
crossed
my
mind
an
idea
which
next
day
i
promptly
put
into
execution
i
went
to
somerset
house
and
there
searched
the
register
of
deaths
at
first
my
efforts
were
in
vain
but
at
last
i
discovered
what
i
sought
namely
an
entry
that
a
young
woman
named
gabrielle
engledue
single
aged
of
unknown
parentage
had
died
of
heart
trouble
at
no
stretton
street
park
lane
on
the
night
of
november
the
seventh
the
body
having
been
cremated
five
days
later
i
pursued
my
inquiries
in
various
quarters
that
day
and
further
discovered
that
the
funeral
expenses
had
been
defrayed
by
some
person
named
moroni
there
had
been
only
two
mourners
of
whom
moroni
had
been
one
still
feeling
very
ill
i
was
compelled
after
reporting
to
the
office
to
remain
at
home
for
the
three
days
which
followed
to
the
two
heads
of
the
firm
i
fear
the
story
that
i
told
must
have
appeared
somewhat
lame
yet
they
exhibited
no
disbelief
but
on
the
contrary
sympathized
with
me
in
my
strange
and
unaccountable
affliction
in
a
drawer
in
my
bedroom
lay
the
five
thousand
pounds
in
bank
notes
just
as
oswald
de
gex
had
given
to
me
i
of
course
said
nothing
of
them
to
harry
but
once
or
twice
i
drew
them
from
the
old
envelope
in
which
i
had
placed
them
and
turned
them
over
in
wonder
i
decided
that
they
would
be
safer
in
the
bank
but
i
hesitated
to
place
them
to
my
credit
so
i
at
last
put
them
away
in
the
bottom
of
an
old
which
had
belonged
to
my
father
resolving
to
try
to
forget
their
existence
though
perhaps
i
did
at
last
manage
to
forget
the
bribe
yet
i
could
not
put
from
myself
the
memory
of
that
beautiful
girl
the
cause
of
whose
death
i
had
certified
the
perfect
countenance
haunted
me
constantly
in
my
dreams
i
often
saw
her
alive
and
well
the
marvellous
face
was
turned
towards
me
with
merry
dancing
dark
eyes
and
a
tantalizing
smile
an
enticing
smile
of
mystery
at
last
i
resolved
to
go
and
face
oswald
de
gex
so
with
that
object
i
one
morning
left
charing
cross
for
florence
travelling
by
the
rome
express
from
the
gare
de
lyon
in
paris
i
changed
at
pisa
and
at
last
as
the
snail
train
as
it
is
known
in
italy
on
account
of
its
slowness
wound
slowly
up
the
beautiful
valley
of
the
arno
the
old
red
roofs
and
domes
of
firenze
la
bella
came
into
view
the
winter
morning
was
sunny
and
brilliant
with
a
clear
blue
sky
and
as
i
drove
through
the
streets
past
the
duomo
with
its
wonderful
campanile
the
city
was
agog
for
it
happened
to
be
the
of
the
befana
i
had
left
my
bag
at
the
station
and
the
taxi
took
me
to
fiesole
the
little
town
outside
which
lived
the
rich
inglese
oswald
de
gex
long
before
we
arrived
the
driver
pointed
out
the
huge
mediæval
country
house
situated
among
the
olives
and
vines
and
commanding
extensive
views
over
florence
and
the
arno
with
the
blue
mountains
beyond
it
was
a
great
white
house
with
red
tiles
and
overhanging
eaves
palatial
indeed
in
its
dimensions
and
for
centuries
the
summer
residence
of
the
head
of
the
great
family
of
clementini
from
whom
the
english
millionaire
had
bought
it
fifteen
years
before
together
with
all
its
pictures
tapestries
and
antiques
with
the
farms
adjoining
on
entering
the
great
gates
of
seventeenth
century
wrought
iron
we
found
ourselves
in
a
glorious
italian
garden
with
a
wonderful
marble
fountain
and
a
good
deal
of
antique
statuary
and
then
driving
through
the
extensive
grounds
past
a
lake
i
at
last
rang
the
bell
quickly
the
great
door
was
opened
by
an
elderly
englishman
in
livery
to
whom
i
gave
my
card
and
asked
to
see
his
master
the
man
without
hesitation
ushered
me
through
a
huge
hall
with
a
wonderfully
frescoed
ceiling
into
a
large
room
hung
with
priceless
tapestry
and
furnished
with
old
gilt
chairs
covered
with
faded
green
silk
damask
i
however
took
very
little
note
of
my
surroundings
so
anxious
was
i
to
again
meet
my
host
of
stretton
street
face
to
face
not
long
did
i
have
to
wait
before
the
door
opened
and
he
stood
before
me
well
mr
garfield
he
asked
quietly
as
he
advanced
to
what
do
i
owe
the
honour
of
this
visit
ah
i
cried
then
you
recollect
me
i
see
you
know
my
name
yes
it
was
upon
your
card
was
his
quiet
reply
but
forgive
me
i
do
not
recollect
ever
having
met
you
before
i
held
my
breath
i
tried
to
speak
but
for
the
moment
words
failed
me
so
angry
was
i
at
his
cleverly
pretended
ignorance
and
flat
denial
chapter
the
fourth
facing
the
music
do
you
seriously
mean
to
say
that
you
have
no
knowledge
of
me
i
demanded
angrily
looking
the
millionaire
straight
in
the
face
yes
sir
he
replied
i
seriously
mean
what
i
say
but
tell
me
he
demanded
resentfully
why
are
you
here
to
claim
acquaintance
with
me
do
you
really
deny
you
have
ever
seen
me
before
i
asked
astounded
at
his
barefaced
pretence
of
ignorance
never
to
my
knowledge
replied
the
man
whose
countenance
i
so
well
recollected
then
you
forget
a
certain
night
not
so
long
ago
when
i
was
called
into
your
house
in
stretton
street
and
you
chatted
confidentially
with
me
about
your
wife
and
your
little
son
my
dear
sir
he
cried
whatever
do
you
mean
i
have
never
seen
you
at
stretton
street
and
i
have
certainly
never
discussed
my
wife
with
you
i
stood
aghast
at
his
continued
denial
but
you
i
asserted
and
there
was
another
matter
a
matter
about
which
i
must
question
you
the
ah
i
see
he
interrupted
you
here
to
blackmail
me
eh
well
let
me
hear
the
worst
and
across
his
rather
oriental
face
there
spread
a
mocking
half
amused
smile
i
am
not
a
blackmailer
i
protested
angrily
i
want
no
money
only
to
know
the
truth
of
what
well
the
truth
concerning
the
death
of
miss
gabrielle
engledue
the
death
of
miss
gabrielle
engledue
he
cried
i
really
understand
you
mr
garfield
at
mention
of
the
name
i
saw
that
he
started
but
almost
imperceptibly
the
man
was
certainly
a
most
perfect
actor
and
his
protestations
of
ignorance
were
indeed
then
you
actually
deny
all
knowledge
of
the
young
lady
i
said
i
know
no
lady
of
that
name
but
she
is
your
niece
i
have
only
one
niece
lady
shalford
and
how
old
is
she
he
hesitated
for
a
few
moments
then
he
answered
oh
she
must
be
about
she
married
shalford
about
ten
years
ago
and
she
lives
at
wickenham
grange
near
malton
in
yorkshire
and
you
have
no
other
niece
none
i
assure
you
but
why
do
you
ask
such
a
question
you
puzzle
me
not
more
than
you
puzzle
me
de
gex
i
replied
with
pique
it
would
be
so
much
easier
if
you
would
be
frank
and
open
with
me
my
dear
sir
you
seem
to
me
to
have
a
bee
in
your
bonnet
about
something
or
other
tell
me
now
what
is
it
simply
that
you
know
me
very
well
but
you
deny
it
you
never
thought
that
i
should
make
this
unwelcome
reappearance
your
appearance
here
as
a
person
is
certainly
unwelcome
he
retorted
you
first
tell
me
that
you
visited
me
at
stretton
street
well
you
may
have
been
in
the
servants
quarters
for
all
i
know
and
please
do
not
be
insulting
i
cried
angrily
i
have
no
intention
of
offering
you
an
insult
sir
but
your
attitude
is
so
very
extraordinary
you
speak
of
a
girl
named
engledue
that
was
the
name
i
think
and
allege
that
she
is
my
niece
why
because
the
young
lady
is
dead
she
died
under
most
suspicious
circumstances
and
you
know
all
about
it
i
said
bluntly
oh
perhaps
you
will
allege
that
i
am
a
murderer
next
he
laughed
as
though
enjoying
the
joke
it
is
no
laughing
matter
i
cried
in
fury
why
not
i
find
all
your
allegations
most
amusing
and
across
his
dark
handsome
face
there
spread
a
smile
his
was
a
face
that
i
could
never
forget
at
one
moment
its
expression
was
kindly
and
full
of
the
next
it
was
hard
and
unrelenting
the
face
of
an
eccentric
criminal
to
me
they
are
the
reverse
of
amusing
i
said
i
allege
that
on
the
night
of
wednesday
november
the
seventh
last
i
was
passing
your
house
in
stretton
street
park
lane
when
your
man
horton
invited
me
inside
and
well
well
i
need
not
describe
what
occurred
there
for
you
recollect
only
too
vividly
without
a
doubt
but
what
i
demand
to
know
is
why
you
asked
me
in
and
what
happened
to
me
after
you
gave
me
that
money
money
i
gave
you
money
he
cried
why
man
alive
you
dreaming
must
be
i
not
dreaming
at
all
it
is
a
hard
fact
indeed
i
still
have
the
money
five
thousand
pounds
in
bank
notes
oswald
de
gex
looked
at
me
strangely
his
sallow
face
coloured
slightly
and
his
lips
compressed
i
had
cornered
him
a
little
further
firmness
and
he
would
no
doubt
admit
that
we
had
met
at
stretton
street
look
here
garfield
he
said
in
a
changed
voice
this
is
beyond
a
joke
you
now
tell
me
that
i
presented
you
with
five
thousand
pounds
i
do
and
i
repeat
it
but
why
should
i
give
you
this
sum
because
i
assisted
you
in
the
commission
of
a
crime
that
a
lie
he
declared
vehemently
forgive
me
for
saying
so
but
i
can
only
think
that
you
are
not
quite
in
your
right
mind
i
have
not
been
in
my
right
mind
for
a
month
or
more
thanks
to
your
deep
plotting
i
retorted
sharply
further
i
am
telling
the
truth
as
i
shall
later
on
tell
it
before
a
court
of
law
i
intend
to
solve
the
mystery
of
the
death
of
gabrielle
engledue
well
i
will
not
hinder
you
he
laughed
grimly
you
mean
that
you
will
not
assist
me
i
mean
that
i
have
no
knowledge
of
any
such
person
nor
have
i
any
knowledge
of
you
he
said
a
perfect
stranger
you
come
here
present
your
card
and
at
once
start
a
series
of
most
serious
allegations
against
me
the
chief
of
them
being
that
i
gave
you
five
thousand
pounds
for
some
assistance
which
you
refuse
to
describe
if
i
tell
you
you
will
only
deny
it
de
gex
i
exclaimed
bitterly
so
what
is
the
use
none
in
fact
i
do
see
that
any
object
is
to
be
gained
in
prolonging
this
interview
was
his
quick
retort
if
as
you
say
i
gave
you
five
thousand
which
i
certainly
never
did
then
what
more
can
you
want
i
however
suspect
that
the
five
thousand
exists
only
in
your
own
imagination
but
i
have
the
sum
intact
in
a
drawer
at
my
home
in
london
it
would
be
of
interest
to
see
it
are
they
the
same
notes
which
you
say
i
gave
you
the
same
i
answered
and
then
i
went
on
to
tell
him
how
i
had
awakened
to
find
myself
in
malo
and
how
the
french
police
had
taken
possession
of
the
money
found
upon
me
ah
he
exclaimed
at
last
it
all
seems
quite
clear
now
you
had
a
bad
illness
my
dear
fellow
your
brain
has
become
unbalanced
and
you
are
now
subject
to
hallucinations
i
regret
my
hard
words
garfield
he
added
in
a
kindly
tone
i
also
regret
that
your
mental
state
is
what
it
is
i
desire
no
sympathy
i
protested
raising
my
voice
angrily
all
i
want
to
know
is
the
truth
i
have
already
told
you
that
as
far
as
i
am
personally
concerned
no
you
have
denied
everything
and
now
you
try
to
treat
me
as
one
demented
i
declared
in
a
fury
the
existence
of
the
bank
notes
you
gave
me
are
sufficient
evidence
against
you
i
think
not
first
i
doubt
if
they
exist
anywhere
save
in
your
imagination
secondly
if
they
do
then
someone
else
may
have
given
them
to
you
you
did
i
would
recognize
you
among
ten
thousand
men
on
the
night
in
question
you
wore
a
dinner
jacket
and
now
you
are
in
grey
that
is
all
the
difference
well
have
it
your
own
way
he
replied
smiling
though
i
could
see
that
he
had
become
palpably
perturbed
by
my
allegations
whatever
had
been
administered
to
me
some
dope
or
other
no
doubt
it
had
been
intended
that
i
should
be
cast
adrift
on
the
continent
as
a
it
was
that
fact
which
maddened
me
the
poor
girl
might
not
have
been
his
niece
of
course
but
whoever
she
had
been
this
man
had
had
some
very
strange
and
distinct
motive
in
getting
rid
of
her
what
it
was
i
had
vowed
to
discover
it
was
apparent
that
de
gex
was
anxious
to
get
rid
of
me
indeed
as
we
stood
together
in
that
fine
old
room
across
the
marble
floor
of
which
strayed
long
beams
of
sunlight
the
door
opened
and
a
pretty
woman
came
in
she
was
dressed
to
go
out
and
asked
will
you
be
long
dear
it
was
the
beautiful
de
gex
in
an
instant
i
recognized
her
by
the
many
photographs
i
had
seen
in
the
picture
papers
no
i
be
with
you
in
a
minute
dear
is
the
car
there
he
asked
it
been
there
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
if
we
do
go
now
we
shall
be
late
in
meeting
hylda
at
the
station
she
said
glancing
at
me
with
undisguised
annoyance
then
she
left
closing
the
door
after
her
across
my
brain
ran
strange
thoughts
i
recollected
his
words
in
stretton
street
regarding
his
spiteful
wife
when
i
had
been
called
in
to
listen
to
his
matrimonial
troubles
but
husband
and
wife
now
appeared
to
be
on
quite
amicable
and
even
affectionate
terms
i
confess
that
i
was
still
bewildered
as
you
my
reader
in
whom
i
am
here
reposing
confidence
would
i
believe
have
been
had
you
found
yourself
in
similar
circumstances
i
see
that
your
wife
is
eager
to
go
out
i
said
but
i
fear
i
must
before
i
go
press
for
a
direct
answer
to
my
questions
de
gex
my
dear
sir
i
have
answered
them
what
more
can
i
say
he
exclaimed
with
affected
dismay
a
very
great
deal
you
can
tell
me
the
truth
i
have
he
snapped
who
this
girl
engledue
is
i
have
not
a
ghost
of
an
idea
are
you
certain
she
is
dead
positive
i
saw
her
lying
dead
in
the
room
which
adjoins
your
library
what
my
wife
room
he
cried
oh
come
let
us
finish
all
this
silly
talk
when
you
are
at
least
frank
with
me
i
am
but
do
you
deny
that
the
young
lady
gabrielle
engledue
died
there
do
you
not
recollect
that
we
both
stood
at
her
do
talk
such
piffle
de
gex
snapped
no
doubt
believing
in
the
end
that
he
would
convince
me
of
his
ignorance
of
the
whole
tragedy
whatever
had
happened
on
that
november
night
was
no
doubt
to
the
distinct
advantage
of
the
wealthy
man
who
stood
before
me
yet
i
was
faced
with
a
difficulty
he
had
uttered
that
most
ugly
word
blackmail
suppose
he
called
the
police
and
accused
me
of
it
his
word
the
word
of
a
wealthy
financier
would
no
doubt
be
taken
by
a
jury
before
my
own
on
the
other
hand
i
had
up
my
sleeve
a
the
death
and
cremation
of
the
mysterious
gabrielle
engledue
probably
the
poor
victim
was
poisoned
hence
the
object
of
her
cremation
to
remove
all
traces
of
it
yet
opposed
to
that
there
still
remained
my
own
most
serious
offence
of
posing
as
a
medical
man
and
giving
a
forged
certificate
concerning
the
cause
of
death
yes
i
was
only
too
keenly
alive
to
my
own
very
precarious
position
yet
i
was
emboldened
by
de
gex
agitation
and
the
pallor
in
his
sallow
cheeks
he
was
no
doubt
feeling
very
uneasy
and
even
a
millionaire
can
feel
uneasy
when
faced
with
a
witness
of
his
own
offence
de
gex
i
am
not
talking
rubbish
i
said
in
all
seriousness
you
appear
to
forget
that
night
when
your
wife
deserted
your
son
in
westbourne
grove
and
then
laughed
at
you
over
the
telephone
from
a
public
he
looked
at
me
very
straight
with
those
eyes
of
his
really
he
exclaimed
that
is
quite
a
new
feature
in
the
affair
let
me
see
what
did
i
tell
you
your
man
horton
invited
me
a
mere
into
your
house
in
stretton
street
he
said
you
were
very
much
worried
and
asked
if
i
would
meet
you
why
i
can
not
imagine
when
we
met
you
were
very
vague
in
your
statements
and
at
first
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
discover
why
i
had
been
asked
to
meet
you
but
soon
you
confided
to
me
the
fact
that
your
wife
being
spiteful
towards
you
had
abandoned
your
heir
little
oswald
in
westbourne
grove
and
had
then
rung
up
from
a
telling
you
to
find
him
bosh
my
dear
fellow
bosh
was
his
reply
first
you
were
never
there
and
secondly
i
never
complained
of
my
wife
behaviour
to
anyone
certainly
not
to
a
stranger
you
did
to
me
i
certainly
am
not
dreaming
but
you
have
already
admitted
that
you
been
in
hospital
in
malo
suffering
from
loss
of
memory
my
memory
has
now
fortunately
been
restored
i
replied
distorted
without
a
doubt
you
would
never
travel
all
the
way
from
london
to
relate
these
absolutely
silly
stories
to
me
if
you
were
in
your
right
senses
my
dear
garfield
he
said
they
not
silly
stories
but
hard
indisputable
facts
i
declared
resentfully
the
millionaire
had
assumed
an
air
of
nonchalance
for
leaning
against
a
big
old
buhl
table
he
took
out
a
cigarette
from
his
gold
case
and
slowly
lit
it
after
which
he
said
you
must
i
think
really
excuse
me
we
have
to
go
down
into
florence
to
meet
my
who
is
coming
from
london
i
afraid
garfield
that
i
can
not
help
you
any
further
you
mean
you
wo
not
at
all
if
i
knew
anything
of
this
young
lady
who
you
said
died
in
my
wife
bedroom
in
stretton
street
and
at
whose
bedside
you
and
i
stood
together
i
would
tell
you
but
i
really
do
he
tossed
his
cigarette
hastily
out
of
the
open
window
no
he
added
i
wo
hear
any
more
i
have
the
time
or
the
inclination
to
listen
to
the
wanderings
of
any
insane
person
i
had
enough
and
so
have
i
i
retorted
you
are
trying
to
mislead
me
by
affecting
ignorance
of
my
very
existence
but
i
do
intend
that
you
shall
escape
i
added
again
raising
my
voice
hush
please
he
said
in
a
calmer
tone
my
wife
may
overhear
i
do
care
i
cried
in
desperation
you
never
dreamed
that
i
should
arise
against
you
as
i
have
you
are
not
fair
towards
me
if
you
revealed
to
me
in
confidence
the
reason
you
gave
me
that
bribe
of
five
thousand
pounds
then
i
on
my
part
would
have
played
the
straight
game
my
dear
sir
play
whatever
game
you
like
it
is
immaterial
to
me
whether
straight
or
crooked
i
do
know
anything
about
what
you
have
been
talking
and
you
have
only
wasted
your
breath
and
got
out
of
temper
for
nothing
again
i
looked
him
straight
in
the
face
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
strain
of
his
clever
denials
was
telling
upon
him
his
dark
complexion
had
paled
in
his
eyes
there
was
a
fierce
haunted
look
as
that
of
a
man
who
was
straining
every
effort
to
remain
calm
under
the
gravest
circumstances
i
have
no
game
to
play
i
declared
i
only
demand
the
truth
why
was
i
invited
into
your
house
in
stretton
street
to
be
present
as
witness
at
the
poor
girl
death
i
do
know
find
out
for
yourself
my
dear
garfield
laughed
the
rich
man
i
have
no
time
to
discuss
this
silly
affair
further
i
sorry
you
have
troubled
to
come
out
from
london
to
see
me
but
really
yours
has
been
a
fool
errand
and
he
turned
towards
the
door
a
fool
errand
i
echoed
i
am
no
fool
and
my
errand
is
in
deep
earnestness
you
may
try
to
befool
me
but
i
tell
you
that
i
will
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
solve
the
problem
which
you
alone
can
explain
well
get
along
with
your
work
he
laughed
in
open
defiance
i
have
no
further
time
to
waste
and
glancing
at
his
watch
he
opened
the
door
and
abruptly
left
me
chapter
the
fifth
the
city
of
the
lily
full
of
indignation
i
remained
for
a
few
further
moments
in
that
wonderful
old
room
the
room
of
faded
tapestries
with
the
marvellous
painted
ceiling
from
the
window
was
afforded
a
glorious
view
over
the
gardens
where
even
in
winter
tangled
masses
of
flowers
ran
riot
while
beyond
lay
the
picturesque
old
tuscan
city
fiesole
is
distinctly
a
village
of
the
wealthy
for
the
several
colossal
villas
built
in
the
days
of
the
medici
and
even
before
are
now
owned
by
rich
foreigners
many
of
them
english
oswald
de
gex
was
one
of
them
he
had
certainly
foiled
me
i
gritted
my
teeth
and
vowed
that
come
what
might
i
would
compel
him
to
accept
the
inevitable
and
reveal
to
me
the
truth
i
left
the
room
and
found
my
way
alone
across
the
great
marble
entrance
hall
and
out
to
where
my
taxi
awaited
me
i
drove
back
to
florence
where
at
the
station
i
obtained
my
bag
and
then
went
to
the
savoy
hotel
in
the
piazza
vittorio
emanuele
where
i
engaged
a
room
for
a
long
time
i
sat
at
my
window
gazing
down
upon
the
busy
square
below
one
of
the
centres
of
florentine
life
the
bell
of
the
duomo
was
ringing
the
shops
were
mostly
closed
and
all
florence
was
out
in
the
streets
it
being
the
festa
of
the
befana
one
of
the
greatest
of
all
the
festas
of
florence
street
urchins
were
parading
the
thoroughfares
with
horns
and
wildly
shouting
and
there
was
an
exchange
of
presents
on
every
hand
at
the
befana
everyone
in
firenze
goes
mad
with
good
intentions
the
artistic
side
of
the
ancient
lily
city
did
not
interest
me
i
knew
it
of
old
i
had
strolled
on
the
lung
arno
i
had
long
ago
with
my
father
on
a
winter
tour
looked
into
the
little
shops
of
the
coral
and
pearl
merchants
on
the
ponte
vecchio
and
i
had
taken
my
at
doney
or
at
giacosa
i
was
no
stranger
in
florence
my
mind
was
fully
occupied
by
the
deep
mystery
of
gabrielle
engledue
death
and
of
the
millionaire
flat
denial
that
we
had
ever
met
before
as
i
sat
gazing
across
the
square
my
anger
and
indignation
increased
that
de
gex
should
have
dared
to
affect
such
entire
ignorance
surpassed
belief
i
tried
to
form
a
scheme
for
further
action
but
could
think
of
no
way
by
which
to
force
him
to
acknowledge
our
previous
meeting
that
the
beautiful
girl
had
died
and
that
her
body
had
been
cremated
upon
the
false
certificate
i
had
given
was
beyond
all
doubt
but
what
had
been
the
rich
man
motive
how
very
perturbed
and
anxious
he
was
i
had
noticed
though
he
put
such
a
very
brave
face
upon
it
and
appeared
so
imperturbable
that
he
could
treat
such
a
serious
matter
as
a
joke
utterly
amazed
me
nevertheless
i
recollected
that
he
had
long
earned
the
reputation
of
being
highly
eccentric
that
afternoon
i
spent
in
wandering
about
the
sunny
streets
of
florence
in
the
evening
i
dined
at
bonciani
in
the
via
panzani
an
unpretentious
place
at
which
i
well
remembered
having
eaten
famously
when
on
my
last
visit
to
florence
afterwards
having
nothing
to
do
i
went
to
a
variety
show
at
the
alhambra
florence
was
full
of
french
and
english
visitors
as
it
always
is
in
winter
so
next
day
i
formed
a
plan
and
in
pretence
of
desiring
to
rent
a
furnished
flat
i
called
at
the
office
of
a
english
in
the
via
tornabuoni
my
real
object
was
to
ascertain
some
facts
concerning
oswald
de
gex
the
english
clerk
became
quite
enthusiastic
when
i
mentioned
him
de
gex
is
greatly
respected
here
he
hastened
to
tell
me
since
he
bought
the
villa
clementini
outside
fiesole
he
has
lived
here
for
about
eight
months
out
of
the
twelve
italians
love
rich
people
and
because
of
his
wealth
he
is
most
popular
i
see
a
good
deal
of
him
for
we
act
as
agents
for
his
property
in
italy
he
has
quite
a
large
estate
mostly
i
mentioned
that
i
had
met
him
in
london
and
then
asked
in
curiosity
do
you
happen
to
know
anything
of
his
niece
a
tall
very
handsome
girl
miss
engledue
for
a
moment
he
reflected
then
he
said
i
recollect
when
up
at
the
villa
just
before
he
went
to
london
that
was
about
three
months
ago
seeing
a
tall
young
lady
she
came
into
the
library
while
i
was
chatting
with
him
but
i
do
know
her
name
was
she
about
i
asked
eagerly
yes
about
that
age
was
his
reply
but
of
course
i
have
no
idea
whether
it
is
the
young
lady
you
mean
had
you
seen
her
before
i
think
so
once
before
she
was
in
the
car
in
the
cascine
with
de
gex
i
wonder
how
i
could
discover
more
about
her
i
asked
who
would
know
robertson
the
butler
or
henderson
the
secretary
the
butler
would
be
best
i
said
how
could
i
approach
him
do
you
think
i
do
want
to
go
up
to
the
villa
it
would
be
easy
he
often
down
at
the
gambrinus
in
the
afternoon
i
frequently
meet
him
there
and
we
have
a
drink
and
a
chat
would
he
be
there
this
afternoon
i
do
wish
you
would
introduce
me
i
urged
the
matter
is
an
important
personal
one
concerning
myself
he
might
be
down
this
afternoon
about
four
replied
the
alert
young
englishman
who
spoke
italian
so
well
i
look
in
there
at
four
if
you
will
be
about
i
certainly
will
be
there
i
said
and
then
we
went
along
to
giacosa
where
we
each
had
that
speciality
known
as
a
piccolo
at
five
minutes
to
four
that
afternoon
i
entered
the
big
gambrinus
café
which
was
nearly
opposite
my
hotel
on
the
other
side
of
the
piazza
and
i
took
a
seat
just
inside
the
door
the
orchestra
was
playing
and
the
place
was
well
filled
with
a
gay
cosmopolitan
crowd
many
of
them
winter
idlers
i
looked
around
wondering
if
the
butler
robertson
had
arrived
and
waited
in
patience
for
the
coming
of
my
friend
punctually
at
four
he
appeared
and
greeting
me
cast
his
eyes
over
the
many
small
tables
until
suddenly
he
exclaimed
ah
there
he
is
we
walked
to
a
table
some
distance
away
where
a
stoutish
englishman
was
smoking
a
cigarette
and
reading
a
newspaper
with
a
glass
of
vermouth
and
seltzer
before
him
hallo
arthur
he
exclaimed
as
he
raised
his
eyes
to
my
friend
this
is
a
friend
of
mine
garfield
my
companion
said
introducing
me
and
then
we
sat
down
and
began
to
chat
at
last
i
could
possess
myself
in
patience
no
longer
and
addressing
the
millionaire
butler
told
him
frankly
that
i
was
in
search
of
information
concerning
the
young
lady
who
had
been
guest
up
at
the
villa
about
three
months
ago
oh
i
suppose
you
mean
miss
thurston
the
young
american
lady
you
but
she
the
lady
i
mean
is
named
engledue
i
replied
oh
i
do
know
anyone
of
that
name
was
his
reply
miss
thurston
has
stayed
with
us
in
london
and
down
in
cornwall
and
has
been
here
several
times
i
fancy
she
some
relation
of
the
mistress
she
first
came
to
stay
about
three
years
ago
when
she
left
school
in
paris
then
she
went
home
to
america
and
after
six
months
came
back
again
to
us
you
have
any
idea
who
her
parents
are
or
where
she
lived
in
america
she
lived
somewhere
near
detroit
i
believe
that
all
i
know
about
her
i
believe
her
people
are
makers
and
extremely
wealthy
at
least
somebody
said
so
and
she
very
free
with
tips
to
the
when
did
she
leave
here
when
the
master
went
to
london
i
was
to
go
too
but
i
had
influenza
and
had
to
remain
here
and
where
was
de
gex
i
inquired
she
was
already
at
stretton
street
she
and
the
little
boy
went
to
london
early
in
october
but
came
back
at
the
end
of
the
month
then
i
questioned
the
estimable
robertson
concerning
the
domestic
happiness
of
his
master
i
said
i
had
heard
rumours
in
london
of
matrimonial
differences
well
that
a
lie
he
replied
quickly
there
is
a
pair
in
the
whole
of
london
society
who
are
more
devoted
to
each
other
this
greatly
surprised
me
after
the
words
that
had
fallen
from
the
millionaire
lips
again
i
referred
to
the
mysterious
gabrielle
whom
i
described
as
minutely
as
i
was
able
and
apparently
my
description
fitted
that
of
rose
thurston
save
for
the
colour
of
her
hair
you
have
no
idea
where
she
is
i
suppose
not
the
slightest
back
in
america
perhaps
she
seems
to
come
over
every
year
i
wonder
if
you
could
find
out
her
address
i
asked
if
you
could
it
would
be
of
very
great
service
to
me
and
i
handed
him
my
card
expressing
a
hope
that
he
would
refrain
from
mentioning
the
matter
to
his
master
i
try
he
said
but
i
fear
i
sha
succeed
henderson
the
master
secretary
would
know
of
course
the
point
at
issue
now
was
whether
the
young
american
girl
who
had
been
the
millionaire
guest
at
the
villa
and
gabrielle
engledue
were
actually
one
and
the
same
person
if
they
were
then
i
had
made
one
step
towards
the
solution
of
the
enigma
i
confess
to
utter
bewilderment
my
brain
was
still
confused
sometimes
my
skull
seemed
wrapped
in
cotton
wool
from
a
mere
unimportant
person
in
the
world
of
electrical
engineering
i
had
suddenly
become
a
man
upon
whom
rested
a
great
and
criminal
responsibility
in
that
huge
garish
café
with
its
great
arc
lamps
glowing
though
night
had
not
yet
fallen
and
with
a
noisy
orchestra
playing
selections
from
the
latest
crazes
of
music
from
the
revues
in
london
i
sat
with
a
perfectly
open
mind
i
had
been
the
victim
of
some
extremely
clever
plot
but
of
its
motive
of
its
ramifications
or
of
its
conception
i
had
no
knowledge
even
my
wildest
imagination
was
at
fault
all
i
knew
was
that
the
de
gex
the
millionaire
who
lived
up
at
the
huge
villa
clementini
had
plotted
against
the
handsome
girl
and
she
had
died
in
his
wife
bedroom
in
stretton
street
well
robertson
how
can
i
find
out
anything
more
about
miss
thurston
give
me
your
advice
i
try
and
see
what
i
can
do
he
said
perhaps
i
may
be
able
to
get
a
glance
at
the
mistress
address
book
i
have
seen
it
try
yes
do
i
said
very
anxiously
it
means
so
very
much
to
me
why
i
hesitated
my
intention
was
to
mislead
both
of
my
companions
well
i
said
with
a
laugh
the
fact
is
i
i
very
fond
of
her
both
men
exchanged
glances
then
they
smiled
almost
imperceptibly
i
know
but
it
struck
them
as
humorous
that
i
had
fallen
in
love
with
the
daughter
of
a
wealthy
american
of
course
i
not
yet
certain
whether
she
is
the
same
lady
i
went
on
she
may
not
be
but
on
calm
consideration
i
believe
she
is
the
description
you
give
of
her
is
exact
well
exclaimed
the
butler
i
see
if
i
can
get
at
the
address
book
she
keeps
it
in
a
drawer
in
her
boudoir
which
is
usually
locked
but
sometimes
she
leaves
it
open
at
any
rate
i
see
what
i
can
do
and
let
you
know
i
thanked
him
and
told
him
that
i
was
staying
at
the
savoy
then
i
was
compelled
to
discuss
with
the
clerk
the
pretended
renting
of
an
apartment
out
by
the
porta
romana
which
he
said
was
vacant
on
the
following
day
in
order
to
still
sustain
the
deception
i
went
and
viewed
the
place
and
found
it
really
quite
comfortable
and
very
reasonable
but
of
course
i
was
compelled
to
express
dislike
of
it
whereupon
my
friend
promised
to
find
me
another
day
after
day
i
waited
in
florence
hoping
against
hope
that
robertson
would
be
able
to
furnish
me
with
miss
thurston
address
but
though
i
saw
him
several
times
he
reported
that
the
drawer
containing
the
address
book
was
still
locked
de
gex
had
gone
to
rome
and
was
away
for
three
days
the
british
ambassador
was
giving
some
official
function
and
the
millionaire
had
been
invited
indeed
i
read
all
about
it
in
the
on
the
fourth
day
he
returned
for
i
saw
him
in
his
big
yellow
car
driving
along
the
via
calzajoli
an
elegant
italian
the
young
marchese
cerretani
was
seated
at
his
side
and
both
were
laughing
together
twice
i
had
been
up
to
the
villa
clementini
and
wandered
around
its
high
white
walls
which
hid
the
beautiful
gardens
from
the
public
gaze
surely
there
was
no
fairer
spot
in
all
sunny
italy
than
that
chosen
by
the
rich
man
as
his
abode
to
the
hundreds
of
visitors
of
all
nations
who
came
up
by
train
to
fiesole
from
florence
to
lunch
or
dine
at
the
various
pleasant
little
restaurants
the
great
imposing
place
was
pointed
out
as
the
residence
of
the
rich
inglese
the
man
who
possessed
more
money
than
any
of
the
most
wealthy
in
the
kingdom
of
italy
when
i
thought
of
that
fateful
night
in
stretton
street
i
waxed
furious
was
it
possible
that
by
the
possession
of
great
riches
a
man
could
commit
crime
with
impunity
perhaps
what
goaded
me
to
desperation
more
than
anything
was
the
foul
trick
that
had
been
played
upon
me
the
administration
of
that
drug
which
had
caused
me
to
lose
all
sense
of
my
own
being
that
subtle
odour
of
had
gripped
me
until
i
felt
faint
and
inert
beneath
its
perfume
and
it
often
returned
to
me
but
in
fancy
of
course
in
the
winter
sunshine
i
wandered
about
the
busy
streets
of
florence
idling
in
the
cafés
gazing
into
the
many
of
the
dealers
in
faked
pictures
and
faked
antiques
while
often
my
wandering
footsteps
led
me
into
one
or
other
of
the
sights
of
the
city
all
of
which
i
had
visited
before
the
national
museum
at
the
bargello
the
laurenziana
library
with
its
rows
of
priceless
chained
manuscripts
the
chiostro
dello
scalzo
where
andrea
del
wonderful
frescoes
adorn
the
walls
or
into
the
palazzo
vecchio
or
the
galleries
of
the
pitti
or
the
uffizi
i
was
merely
killing
time
in
the
faint
hope
that
the
robertson
might
get
for
me
the
information
which
in
the
circumstances
i
was
naturally
most
eager
to
obtain
in
the
course
of
my
erratic
wanderings
through
the
grand
old
city
with
its
host
of
monuments
of
a
glorious
past
i
was
one
morning
passing
the
great
cathedral
and
noticed
a
number
of
people
entering
there
seemed
to
be
an
unusual
number
of
visitors
so
having
nothing
to
do
i
passed
through
the
narrow
door
into
the
sombre
gloom
of
the
magnificent
old
place
one
of
the
most
noteworthy
and
most
beautiful
sacred
buildings
in
the
world
at
first
entering
from
the
bright
sunshine
of
the
piazza
i
could
scarcely
see
so
dim
was
the
huge
interior
but
slowly
my
vision
rather
bad
since
my
strange
adventure
grew
accustomed
to
the
and
i
saw
that
upon
the
high
altar
there
were
many
long
candles
burning
in
their
brass
sconces
and
before
the
high
altar
three
priests
in
gorgeous
vestments
were
kneeling
in
the
great
cavernous
place
with
its
choir
beneath
the
dome
i
heard
low
prayers
in
latin
men
and
women
who
passed
me
bowed
and
crossed
themselves
while
many
knelt
the
glorious
cathedral
of
santa
maria
del
fiore
so
called
from
the
lily
which
figures
in
the
arms
of
florence
hence
the
lily
city
had
always
an
attraction
for
me
as
it
has
for
every
visitor
to
the
ancient
tuscan
capital
the
stained
glass
of
ghiberti
the
wonderful
mosaics
of
gaddo
gaddi
the
frescoes
of
angels
by
santi
di
tito
and
the
beautiful
pictures
by
the
great
mediæval
masters
all
are
marvellous
and
worth
crossing
the
world
to
see
from
before
the
altar
a
long
spiral
mist
of
incense
was
rising
and
about
me
as
i
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
enormous
interior
many
visitors
were
passing
out
from
the
dim
religious
gloom
into
the
light
of
the
open
doorway
suddenly
my
eyes
caught
sight
of
a
countenance
i
held
my
breath
standing
rooted
to
the
spot
what
i
saw
staggered
belief
was
it
only
a
chimera
of
my
unbalanced
imagination
or
was
it
actual
fact
for
a
few
seconds
i
remained
undecided
then
aghast
and
amazed
i
became
convinced
that
it
was
a
stern
reality
the
mystery
of
the
affair
at
stretton
street
became
in
that
single
moment
a
problem
even
more
than
ever
bewildering
chapter
the
sixth
another
puzzle
kneeling
before
donatello
magnificent
picture
of
the
virgin
over
one
of
the
side
altars
her
outline
dimly
illuminated
by
the
light
of
many
candles
was
a
slim
young
woman
in
deep
mourning
her
head
was
bowed
in
an
attitude
of
great
devotion
but
a
few
moments
later
when
she
raised
her
face
i
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
the
countenance
was
that
of
the
dead
girl
gabrielle
engledue
an
involuntary
exclamation
left
my
lips
and
a
woman
standing
near
me
heard
me
and
wondered
kneeling
beside
the
girl
in
black
was
a
italian
of
about
he
was
somewhat
handsome
though
a
sinister
expression
played
about
his
lips
i
watched
the
pair
for
several
minutes
wondering
whether
in
my
brain
unbalanced
as
it
had
been
the
scene
was
a
mere
chimera
on
my
part
and
that
after
all
the
girl
only
slightly
resembled
the
victim
at
stretton
street
the
latter
i
had
not
seen
in
life
and
death
always
alters
the
features
nevertheless
the
sudden
encounter
was
most
startling
and
from
where
i
stood
behind
a
great
marble
column
i
watched
them
at
last
both
rose
and
crossing
themselves
piously
walked
slowly
to
the
door
i
followed
them
it
surely
could
not
be
that
the
girl
whose
death
certificate
i
had
forged
and
whose
body
had
been
reduced
to
ashes
was
actually
alive
and
well
i
recollected
that
sum
of
five
thousand
pounds
and
the
strange
adventures
which
had
befallen
me
after
i
had
accepted
the
bribe
to
pose
as
a
doctor
and
certify
that
death
had
been
due
to
natural
causes
outside
in
the
bright
sunlight
of
the
piazza
i
obtained
a
full
view
of
her
her
rather
shabby
black
was
evidently
of
good
material
but
her
face
struck
me
as
distinctly
strange
the
expression
in
her
dark
luminous
eyes
was
fixed
as
though
she
were
fascinated
and
utterly
unconscious
of
all
about
her
she
walked
mechanically
without
interest
and
utterly
heedless
of
where
she
went
her
companion
hand
was
upon
her
arm
as
she
crossed
to
the
via
calzajoli
and
i
wondered
if
she
were
blind
i
had
never
before
seen
such
a
blank
hopeless
expression
in
a
eyes
the
man
on
the
contrary
was
shrewd
and
alert
his
eyes
shot
shrewd
glances
from
beneath
black
bushy
eyebrows
with
a
keen
penetrating
gaze
as
though
nothing
escaped
him
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
hurry
her
in
fear
of
being
recognized
he
had
not
noticed
me
hence
in
the
bustle
of
the
busy
street
i
managed
to
get
up
close
behind
them
when
of
a
sudden
i
heard
her
exclaim
not
so
fast
really
i
ca
walk
so
fast
she
spoke
in
english
her
companion
uncouth
and
heedless
still
had
his
hand
upon
her
arm
hurrying
her
along
without
slackening
his
pace
she
seemed
like
a
girl
in
a
dream
truly
she
was
very
handsome
a
strange
tragic
figure
amid
all
the
hubbub
of
florence
the
city
of
noise
and
of
narrow
streets
where
counts
and
rub
shoulders
and
the
tradesmen
are
ever
on
the
look
out
to
profit
if
only
a
few
soldi
upon
the
innocent
foreigner
firenze
la
bella
or
florence
as
the
average
englishman
knows
it
is
surely
a
city
of
strange
people
and
of
strange
moods
by
the
discordant
clanging
of
its
church
bells
the
florentines
are
moved
to
gaiety
or
to
piety
and
by
the
daily
articles
in
the
local
journals
the
or
the
they
can
be
incited
to
riot
or
violence
the
tuscans
fine
aristocratic
nobles
with
ten
centuries
of
lineage
behind
them
and
splendid
peasants
with
all
their
glorious
traditions
of
feudal
servitude
under
the
nobile
are
after
all
like
children
with
a
simplicity
that
is
astounding
combined
with
a
cunning
that
is
amazing
along
the
via
calzajoli
i
followed
the
pair
in
breathless
eagerness
at
that
hour
of
the
morning
the
central
thoroughfare
is
always
crowded
by
business
men
cooks
out
shopping
and
the
foreigners
who
come
in
hand
to
gaze
at
and
admire
the
thousand
wonderful
monuments
of
the
ancient
city
of
medici
the
girl
face
certainly
resembled
very
closely
that
of
the
dead
girl
gabrielle
engledue
the
countenance
i
had
seen
at
stretton
street
was
white
and
lifeless
while
that
of
the
girl
was
fresh
and
rosy
nevertheless
that
blank
expression
upon
her
face
and
the
fact
that
her
companion
had
linked
his
arm
in
hers
both
pointed
to
the
fact
that
either
her
vision
was
dim
or
her
great
dark
eyes
were
actually
sightless
the
man
was
fairly
well
dressed
but
the
girl
was
very
shabby
her
rusty
black
her
cheap
stockings
her
shoes
and
her
faded
hat
combined
to
present
a
picture
of
poverty
indeed
the
very
fact
of
the
neglect
of
her
dress
was
increasing
evidence
that
her
vision
was
dim
for
surely
she
would
not
go
forth
with
the
rent
in
the
elbow
of
her
blouse
did
she
know
that
it
was
torn
just
as
we
were
passing
the
ancient
church
of
or
san
michele
with
its
wonderful
armorial
bearings
by
luca
della
robbia
an
old
man
with
long
white
hair
and
beard
whom
i
took
to
be
one
of
the
mangy
painters
who
copy
the
masterpieces
in
the
uffizi
or
the
pitti
passed
by
and
raising
his
hat
wished
the
pair
buon
giorno
the
girl
companion
returned
the
salute
with
a
slight
expression
of
annoyance
perhaps
at
being
recognized
but
the
girl
took
no
notice
and
did
not
acknowledge
him
the
man
uttered
some
words
in
the
girl
ear
and
then
hurried
her
on
more
quickly
at
the
same
time
glancing
furtively
around
it
was
quite
plain
that
he
had
no
wish
to
be
seen
there
hence
my
curiosity
became
increased
every
moment
i
however
feared
that
he
might
realize
i
was
following
them
but
i
did
not
mean
that
they
should
escape
me
in
the
piazza
della
signorina
they
halted
opposite
that
great
old
building
the
palazzo
vecchio
where
several
people
were
awaiting
an
omnibus
and
as
they
stood
there
the
girl
who
bore
such
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
dead
niece
of
the
millionaire
stared
straight
before
her
taking
no
notice
of
anything
about
her
a
strange
statuesque
pathetic
figure
inert
and
entirely
guided
by
the
man
at
her
side
i
was
compelled
to
draw
back
and
watch
them
from
a
distance
hoping
that
i
might
be
successful
in
following
them
to
their
destination
it
certainly
was
strange
that
the
girl
who
was
so
much
like
gabrielle
engledue
should
be
there
in
florence
within
a
mile
or
two
of
de
villa
as
i
watched
yet
another
person
a
woman
of
about
forty
recognizing
the
girl
companion
smiled
as
she
passed
while
he
on
his
part
raised
his
hat
the
woman
who
had
passed
struck
me
as
being
either
english
or
american
for
there
are
many
residents
in
florence
for
a
second
i
debated
within
myself
and
then
a
moment
later
i
followed
her
until
she
turned
a
corner
in
the
via
di
porta
rossa
then
i
hurried
and
overtaking
her
politely
raised
my
hat
i
trust
you
will
pardon
me
madame
i
exclaimed
in
english
as
she
started
and
looked
at
me
askance
i
presume
you
are
either
english
or
american
i
am
american
she
replied
with
a
pronounced
drawl
please
forgive
my
inquisitiveness
but
i
seek
your
aid
in
a
little
matter
which
is
of
greatest
consequence
to
me
i
went
on
a
moment
ago
as
you
crossed
the
piazza
you
encountered
an
italian
gentleman
and
a
girl
could
you
tell
me
the
gentleman
name
what
the
person
i
bowed
to
a
moment
ago
she
exclaimed
oh
doctor
moroni
moroni
i
recollected
the
name
he
was
one
of
the
mourners
and
the
girl
i
asked
ah
i
do
not
know
i
saw
her
out
with
an
old
woman
the
other
day
but
i
have
no
idea
who
she
is
is
doctor
moroni
a
doctor
of
medicine
i
inquired
yes
the
people
at
the
of
the
lung
arno
where
i
live
always
call
him
in
i
was
ill
six
months
ago
and
he
attended
me
he
lives
in
the
via
cavezzo
near
the
porta
romona
number
six
i
believe
i
am
sure
i
am
extremely
obliged
to
you
i
replied
very
gratefully
i
have
a
very
strong
reason
for
asking
these
questions
reasons
which
concern
the
young
lady
i
added
the
american
woman
smiled
and
then
reiterating
my
thanks
i
raised
my
hat
and
left
her
at
least
i
had
discovered
the
identity
of
the
girl
companion
he
was
a
doctor
hence
it
was
most
probable
that
she
was
under
his
charge
nevertheless
it
was
strange
that
he
should
take
her
to
the
duomo
and
pray
at
her
side
doctors
do
not
usually
act
in
that
manner
with
their
patients
when
i
returned
to
the
piazza
the
pair
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
therefore
i
strolled
to
the
nearest
café
and
sat
down
with
a
cigarette
to
think
out
the
remarkable
affair
one
or
two
features
of
the
problem
now
became
more
than
ever
puzzling
first
in
view
of
the
fact
that
i
had
seen
gabrielle
engledue
lying
dead
and
had
for
a
bribe
of
five
thousand
pounds
signed
a
death
certificate
purporting
to
be
from
doctor
gordon
garfield
of
queen
anne
street
cavendish
square
it
seemed
beyond
credence
that
the
girl
who
had
died
and
been
cremated
should
be
led
about
the
streets
of
florence
by
this
italian
doctor
moroni
oswald
de
gex
denials
were
in
themselves
only
thin
and
yet
they
were
all
very
clever
and
carefully
prepared
the
story
of
how
his
wife
had
left
his
little
son
in
westbourne
grove
to
be
discovered
by
the
police
was
no
doubt
well
thought
out
de
gex
and
his
wife
were
actually
on
most
affectionate
terms
hence
the
tale
he
had
told
had
been
purposely
concocted
in
order
to
mislead
me
besides
his
pretence
that
the
dead
girl
had
been
his
niece
was
of
course
a
similarly
concocted
story
to
mislead
me
and
also
to
discredit
me
if
perchance
i
made
any
unwelcome
inquiries
that
i
had
been
half
asphyxiated
and
then
drugged
until
my
mental
balance
had
been
upset
was
quite
plain
and
it
was
equally
plain
that
de
gex
did
not
intend
that
i
should
be
capable
of
making
inquiries
concerning
the
events
of
that
memorable
november
night
when
i
had
been
thrown
out
of
the
on
that
french
highway
near
malo
the
had
been
purposely
left
in
my
pocket
i
had
already
copied
the
numbers
and
had
called
upon
the
bankers
in
pall
mall
but
there
was
no
record
that
any
of
them
had
been
issued
to
him
that
payment
had
evidently
been
very
well
concealed
on
every
hand
it
appeared
quite
plain
that
i
had
been
the
victim
of
some
strange
and
remarkable
conspiracy
the
motive
of
which
was
entirely
obscure
surely
i
must
have
been
watched
and
my
habits
noted
de
gex
had
known
that
i
frequently
passed
his
door
on
my
way
to
visit
my
uncle
and
further
he
must
have
known
that
i
should
pass
on
that
fateful
night
in
november
when
horton
was
sent
out
to
entice
me
within
but
the
chief
point
of
that
complex
puzzle
was
the
fact
that
there
in
florence
within
a
mile
or
two
of
the
millionaire
almost
regal
residence
i
had
encountered
a
living
girl
who
in
every
feature
was
the
exact
counterpart
of
the
poor
girl
whose
death
and
cremation
stood
recorded
in
the
official
registry
at
somerset
house
when
in
london
i
had
been
half
inclined
to
call
upon
doctor
gordon
garfield
and
explain
the
situation
but
such
confession
must
i
knew
lead
to
my
prosecution
and
inevitable
imprisonment
i
had
taken
a
false
step
while
under
the
baneful
influence
of
some
drug
which
had
stultified
my
own
volition
and
held
me
powerless
to
resist
the
temptation
i
was
now
endeavouring
to
seek
the
truth
that
the
amazing
adventure
in
stretton
street
was
not
the
outcome
of
imagination
was
proved
by
the
entry
in
the
register
at
somerset
house
and
also
by
the
evidence
of
the
cremation
of
the
body
but
that
the
beautiful
girl
i
had
seen
lying
dead
could
now
be
walking
about
the
streets
of
florence
was
of
course
utterly
absurd
was
my
memory
in
my
rather
weak
state
of
health
playing
tricks
with
me
i
began
to
fear
that
such
was
the
case
as
i
sat
over
my
bock
watching
the
tide
of
florentine
life
pass
and
repass
across
the
great
piazza
i
began
to
laugh
at
myself
and
felt
half
inclined
to
abandon
the
inquiry
still
it
was
all
most
mysterious
and
mystifying
why
had
i
been
marked
down
as
a
tool
to
further
the
millionaire
ends
and
who
after
all
was
the
victim
i
tried
to
dismiss
the
apparently
sightless
girl
from
my
mind
but
somehow
the
affair
obsessed
me
i
seemed
impelled
to
go
farther
and
try
to
elucidate
the
mystery
i
endeavoured
to
make
up
my
mind
to
forget
it
all
and
return
to
england
and
to
my
work
at
francis
and
goldsmith
but
all
to
no
avail
my
duty
i
felt
was
to
leave
no
stone
unturned
until
i
had
discovered
whether
gabrielle
engledue
had
died
from
natural
causes
or
as
a
result
of
foul
play
the
pale
tragic
face
of
the
girl
i
had
encountered
in
the
duomo
haunted
me
towards
the
doctor
moroni
i
felt
an
instinctive
dislike
even
though
i
had
no
cause
to
distrust
him
i
think
it
was
the
strange
intuition
i
experienced
at
that
moment
which
caused
me
to
decide
to
act
with
discretion
and
caution
and
to
discover
all
that
i
could
concerning
the
doctor
and
his
companion
with
a
fixed
plan
i
returned
to
my
hotel
ate
my
luncheon
in
the
big
à
which
was
crowded
with
foreigners
wintering
in
florence
then
after
lunch
i
complained
to
the
manager
of
feeling
unwell
and
asked
him
to
telephone
to
doctor
moroni
in
the
via
cavezzo
ah
a
most
excellent
doctor
remarked
the
hotel
manager
he
has
a
very
large
practice
among
the
english
and
americans
and
he
is
quite
popular
i
suppose
you
know
him
no
i
have
only
heard
of
him
and
of
his
cleverness
i
said
with
affected
carelessness
ten
minutes
later
the
manager
sent
me
a
message
by
a
page
that
the
doctor
would
call
at
three
so
in
my
pretended
illness
i
went
to
my
room
and
feigned
the
symptoms
of
acute
indigestion
punctually
the
doctor
arrived
and
greeted
me
in
his
most
professional
manner
i
at
once
explained
that
an
american
lady
of
my
acquaintance
had
recommended
him
whereupon
he
bowed
smiled
and
seating
himself
before
me
inquired
my
symptoms
his
looks
were
certainly
not
an
index
to
his
character
for
though
he
appeared
so
stern
and
taciturn
yet
at
heart
he
was
i
saw
a
very
humorous
man
a
true
tuscan
who
showed
his
white
teeth
when
he
laughed
gesticulated
violently
and
spoke
english
with
a
refined
accent
that
was
particularly
charming
it
is
probably
the
change
of
diet
he
declared
at
last
after
diagnosing
my
symptoms
i
see
many
such
cases
among
foreigners
who
are
unused
to
some
of
our
rather
indigestible
dishes
the
latter
are
very
toothsome
and
they
eat
heartily
with
dire
results
and
he
smiled
so
well
indeed
did
i
describe
my
supposed
ailment
that
before
he
left
he
wrote
me
out
a
prescription
afterwards
i
made
pretence
of
being
a
perfect
stranger
in
florence
i
longed
to
speak
of
oswald
de
gex
but
feared
to
do
so
because
his
suspicions
might
by
that
become
aroused
if
so
then
all
hope
of
discovering
the
true
facts
would
instantly
vanish
i
hope
you
will
soon
be
all
right
and
that
you
will
enjoy
your
visit
to
our
tuscany
he
said
very
pleasantly
florence
is
very
full
of
visitors
just
now
are
you
remaining
long
i
really
ca
tell
was
my
reply
my
business
in
london
may
recall
me
at
any
time
then
i
thanked
him
for
his
visit
and
remarked
that
if
the
mixture
gave
me
no
relief
i
would
probably
call
upon
him
indeed
it
was
for
this
latter
reason
that
i
had
called
him
in
by
making
his
acquaintance
in
that
manner
i
would
i
saw
excite
no
suspicion
and
i
hoped
to
be
able
to
meet
the
girl
who
was
apparently
under
his
charge
while
i
had
been
consulting
him
i
noticed
that
he
seemed
a
man
of
curious
moods
at
one
moment
his
dark
countenance
was
sullen
and
sinister
while
at
the
next
his
face
broadened
into
an
expression
of
he
spoke
english
extremely
well
and
was
apparently
a
man
of
considerable
taste
and
refinement
truly
the
situation
was
so
puzzling
that
i
was
bewildered
after
he
had
gone
i
myself
and
went
across
to
the
gambrinus
where
i
had
an
appointment
with
robertson
i
found
him
seated
alone
at
a
table
in
the
corner
awaiting
me
well
he
said
i
got
that
address
for
you
garfield
the
address
of
miss
thurston
and
he
handed
me
a
slip
of
paper
upon
which
was
written
miss
rose
thurston
cedar
cottage
overstrand
norfolk
but
i
thought
you
said
she
lived
near
detroit
i
remarked
she
and
her
mother
did
live
in
america
but
i
have
discovered
that
they
now
have
a
house
near
cromer
was
the
butler
reply
so
in
acknowledgment
of
his
services
i
passed
him
a
couple
of
italian
notes
and
we
then
had
a
drink
together
while
doing
so
a
strange
thought
crossed
my
mind
could
it
be
possible
that
the
girl
i
had
seen
with
doctor
moroni
and
rose
thurston
were
one
and
the
same
chapter
the
seventh
the
millionaire
apprehensions
that
same
evening
i
made
a
number
of
inquiries
concerning
doctor
moroni
on
every
hand
i
heard
high
praise
of
his
skill
he
was
one
of
the
principal
physicians
at
the
great
hospital
at
gelsomino
and
among
other
of
his
illustrious
patients
there
had
been
a
russian
grand
duke
and
an
austrian
princess
who
lived
in
a
magnificent
villa
upon
the
viale
dei
colli
i
went
about
the
wonderful
city
of
art
collecting
information
concerning
the
doctor
where
and
when
i
could
because
a
startling
fact
had
been
revealed
to
me
by
robertson
namely
that
moroni
was
de
gex
medical
attendant
in
the
when
the
narrow
ancient
of
florence
with
their
ponderous
palaces
with
windows
are
so
and
cavernous
the
place
seems
a
city
of
evil
deeds
as
indeed
it
was
in
the
days
of
the
medici
and
of
the
borgias
as
i
trod
those
streets
between
the
porta
romana
and
santa
maria
novella
i
confess
that
i
became
apprehensive
of
a
nervous
breakdown
that
a
girl
had
been
wilfully
done
to
death
in
that
west
end
mansion
and
that
i
had
accepted
a
bribe
to
aid
and
abet
the
assassin
were
undeniable
facts
the
wealthy
man
evidently
believed
that
for
my
own
sake
and
in
order
to
escape
prosecution
i
would
not
seek
to
solve
the
enigma
now
as
i
reflected
upon
my
interview
at
the
villa
clementini
i
realized
how
artful
he
was
in
denying
everything
and
yet
allowing
me
a
loophole
for
escape
he
had
mentioned
blackmail
an
ugly
word
with
ugly
consequences
that
i
dare
not
go
to
the
metropolitan
police
and
make
any
statement
of
what
i
had
witnessed
or
of
how
i
had
acted
i
still
held
that
five
thousand
pounds
bribe
intact
the
accursed
notes
were
at
the
flat
at
rivermead
mansions
my
position
was
now
untenable
when
that
night
i
retired
to
my
room
i
realized
that
the
situation
was
hopeless
how
could
i
support
any
charge
against
a
man
who
being
a
millionaire
could
purchase
manufactured
evidence
as
is
done
every
day
just
as
easily
as
he
could
purchase
a
cigar
the
evidence
given
in
judicial
courts
in
every
european
capital
in
cases
where
the
party
either
plaintiff
or
defendant
is
well
possessed
of
this
world
goods
is
usually
tainted
in
no
place
on
earth
can
money
work
more
marvels
than
in
a
court
of
law
witnesses
who
make
testimony
a
profession
for
big
fees
appear
in
every
assize
court
in
the
world
and
some
of
them
are
alas
experts
true
it
is
that
every
man
has
his
price
and
the
more
so
in
these
hard
days
of
riot
and
ruin
justice
and
brotherly
love
departed
with
the
victorian
era
the
old
game
of
played
by
our
grandfathers
seems
to
be
the
only
one
practised
in
our
modern
times
with
such
thoughts
i
fell
asleep
next
day
i
spent
in
again
wandering
the
streets
of
florence
hoping
to
obtain
another
glimpse
of
moroni
and
his
fair
charge
i
went
to
the
duomo
and
waited
near
that
where
i
had
first
seen
them
then
as
they
did
not
come
i
idled
before
a
café
in
the
via
calzajoli
and
again
in
the
piazza
della
signorina
but
i
saw
nothing
of
them
that
afternoon
i
spent
the
winter
sunshine
in
the
cascine
the
beautiful
wood
beside
the
arno
where
the
florentines
go
each
day
for
the
either
in
their
landaus
with
armorial
bearings
upon
the
panels
in
modern
or
on
foot
the
afternoon
though
it
was
winter
was
glorious
even
though
the
cold
wind
from
the
apennines
swept
sharply
down
the
valley
yet
everyone
was
wrapped
up
warmly
and
the
fresh
air
was
invigorating
though
i
kept
my
eyes
open
everywhere
i
failed
to
detect
that
slim
figure
in
rusty
black
i
allowed
the
following
day
to
pass
then
at
four
in
the
afternoon
i
called
at
the
house
of
doctor
moroni
in
pretence
of
again
consulting
him
upon
the
door
of
the
great
old
house
now
converted
into
spacious
flats
was
a
small
rather
tarnished
brass
plate
with
the
words
moroni
primo
piano
so
i
climbed
the
wide
stone
stairs
to
the
first
floor
and
rang
the
bell
my
summons
was
answered
by
a
tall
swarthy
italian
maid
who
wore
a
dainty
muslin
apron
but
no
cap
as
is
the
custom
in
italy
she
was
a
piedmontese
for
in
her
hair
she
wore
several
of
those
large
pins
with
round
heads
of
silver
filigree
placed
in
a
semicircle
at
the
back
of
her
head
until
they
formed
a
kind
of
halo
the
signore
dottore
is
at
home
was
her
reply
in
italian
be
pleased
to
enter
and
she
showed
me
along
a
narrow
hall
to
what
was
evidently
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
was
close
on
account
of
the
charcoal
stove
and
the
room
smelt
of
some
disinfectant
i
had
sat
there
for
some
moments
when
i
heard
a
door
open
and
voices
sounded
speaking
in
english
very
well
signore
i
heard
the
doctor
say
i
will
be
up
at
the
villa
at
eleven
good
replied
the
other
you
will
not
be
troubled
by
robertson
this
time
he
will
be
away
i
am
sending
him
on
a
message
to
pisa
as
i
do
not
want
him
about
he
is
too
inquisitive
besides
you
will
not
come
to
the
house
you
quite
understand
where
we
shall
meet
quite
signore
replied
moroni
by
the
mode
in
which
the
doctor
addressed
his
visitor
and
the
mention
of
robertson
it
was
plain
that
he
was
speaking
with
oswald
de
gex
why
was
the
butler
to
be
sent
to
pisa
i
wondered
i
sat
breathless
listening
to
the
footsteps
along
the
hall
and
to
moroni
wishing
his
visitor
good
afternoon
a
few
moments
later
he
opened
the
door
brusquely
and
with
a
pleasant
smile
apologized
for
keeping
me
waiting
then
he
conducted
me
to
his
a
gloomy
frowsy
little
apartment
much
as
is
usual
in
florentine
houses
in
winter
well
he
asked
and
how
do
you
feel
now
mr
garfield
my
reply
was
the
reverse
of
satisfactory
the
mixture
had
done
me
good
i
said
but
i
still
felt
excruciating
pains
after
eating
in
consequence
he
felt
my
pulse
and
took
my
temperature
while
i
on
my
part
strained
my
ears
listening
for
any
feminine
voice
was
the
girl
whose
secret
i
sought
still
there
once
i
heard
a
woman
voice
but
she
cried
in
italian
to
a
named
enrichetta
hence
she
was
probably
the
maid
who
had
admitted
me
moroni
after
he
had
concluded
his
examination
seemed
a
little
puzzled
no
doubt
i
had
in
my
ignorance
described
some
imaginary
symptom
which
was
not
in
accordance
with
what
he
expected
to
find
he
however
gave
me
another
prescription
and
as
he
wrote
it
i
wondered
how
he
would
act
if
he
knew
that
my
object
in
becoming
his
patient
was
to
probe
the
mystery
of
the
affair
in
stretton
street
i
had
at
least
gained
knowledge
of
his
intended
visit
to
the
villa
clementini
unknown
to
the
butler
robertson
he
was
to
be
there
either
at
eleven
that
night
or
at
eleven
next
morning
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
possibly
learn
something
of
interest
if
i
watched
the
doctor
movements
at
the
hours
indicated
your
symptoms
rather
puzzle
me
said
the
doctor
at
last
eyeing
me
from
beneath
his
bushy
black
brows
to
tell
the
truth
i
fancy
you
must
have
eaten
something
poisonous
at
one
of
the
restaurants
they
sometimes
use
tinned
food
which
is
not
quite
good
and
it
sets
up
irritant
poisoning
i
had
a
case
very
similar
to
yours
last
week
the
climate
here
did
not
suit
him
and
he
has
returned
to
england
oh
i
hope
to
be
better
in
a
few
days
doctor
i
said
cheerfully
for
i
was
anxious
for
another
opportunity
to
visit
him
i
wanted
to
see
and
if
possible
speak
in
secret
with
the
girl
who
bore
such
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
dead
gabrielle
engledue
on
returning
to
the
hotel
i
rang
up
the
villa
clementini
and
inquired
for
robertson
in
a
few
moments
i
spoke
to
him
asking
if
he
were
coming
down
to
the
gambrinus
i
sorry
he
replied
i
have
to
go
to
pisa
by
the
eight
train
but
i
shall
be
back
morning
by
that
i
established
the
fact
that
oswald
de
gex
had
an
appointment
with
moroni
at
eleven
that
night
and
not
on
the
following
morning
i
ate
my
dinner
at
bonciani
near
the
station
a
place
little
patronized
by
foreigners
but
where
one
obtains
the
best
tuscan
cooking
and
after
an
hour
or
so
over
coffee
at
the
bottegone
i
took
a
taxi
up
to
fiesole
the
night
was
cold
but
dry
and
moonlit
as
we
ascended
the
steep
hill
a
glorious
panorama
spread
before
us
for
below
lay
the
valley
of
the
arno
with
the
twinkling
lights
of
the
ancient
city
and
the
great
pale
moon
upon
the
shimmering
river
rendering
it
like
a
scene
from
fairyland
and
as
we
went
up
beyond
san
domenico
through
those
lands
which
in
spring
and
summer
are
so
fruitful
with
their
vines
and
olives
two
peasant
swains
passed
chanting
one
of
the
old
those
quaint
of
the
tuscan
the
same
which
have
been
sung
for
centuries
in
and
about
old
firenze
acqua
di
rio
teco
sarò
di
luglio
e
di
gennaio
dove
tu
muori
te
morirò
tuscany
is
essentially
a
land
of
love
where
the
fierce
flame
of
affection
burns
in
the
hearts
of
all
the
people
and
where
a
hot
word
is
quickly
followed
by
a
and
jealousy
is
ever
cruel
and
unrelenting
arriving
at
last
in
the
little
piazza
at
fiesole
where
a
number
of
people
were
awaiting
the
last
tram
to
take
them
back
into
florence
i
alighted
paid
the
man
and
continued
my
journey
on
foot
still
climbing
the
high
road
which
led
through
the
chestnut
woods
of
ricorbico
until
at
last
i
found
myself
at
the
corner
of
the
grounds
of
the
villa
clementini
close
to
a
pair
of
gates
of
mediæval
which
closed
the
south
entrance
to
the
magnificent
domain
on
either
side
of
the
road
were
high
walls
with
tall
cypresses
behind
which
cast
their
deep
shadows
over
the
highway
rendering
it
dark
around
the
entrance
i
glanced
at
my
luminous
wristwatch
a
relic
of
my
war
service
and
found
that
it
still
wanted
ten
minutes
to
eleven
therefore
i
drew
back
beneath
the
wall
and
in
the
black
shadow
awaited
the
millionaire
visitor
to
pass
on
to
the
main
entrance
i
suppose
i
had
been
there
ten
minutes
or
so
when
i
detected
approaching
footsteps
in
the
darkness
and
presently
the
familiar
figure
appeared
in
the
patch
of
moonlight
only
to
be
swallowed
up
in
the
black
shadows
a
moment
later
approaching
the
great
iron
gates
which
were
a
side
entrance
to
the
grounds
he
drew
a
key
from
his
pocket
unlocked
them
easily
and
passed
in
without
however
them
after
him
his
visit
there
was
undoubtedly
a
secret
one
or
de
gex
would
not
have
given
him
the
key
of
the
entrance
he
used
himself
nor
would
he
have
sent
away
his
butler
robertson
the
visitor
footsteps
suddenly
ceased
for
he
was
undoubtedly
crossing
the
grass
in
consequence
i
stole
on
tiptoe
up
to
the
gates
and
entering
saw
in
the
moonlight
that
moroni
was
stealing
along
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
great
country
mansion
many
of
the
windows
of
which
were
illuminated
as
i
halted
my
ears
caught
the
strains
of
orchestral
music
a
waltz
was
being
played
for
as
i
afterwards
knew
a
gay
ball
was
in
progress
the
cars
entering
and
leaving
by
the
main
carriage
road
a
few
seconds
later
i
crept
on
in
the
direction
the
doctor
had
taken
at
first
i
feared
that
as
is
so
often
the
case
in
italy
savage
dogs
might
be
kept
there
at
night
to
attack
any
thief
or
intruder
but
as
moroni
had
entered
so
boldly
it
was
evident
that
if
any
were
kept
there
they
were
that
evening
locked
up
hence
i
went
forward
in
confidence
until
i
came
to
the
edge
of
a
beautiful
lake
lying
unruffled
in
the
moonlight
and
surrounded
by
many
pieces
of
ancient
statuary
most
of
them
and
as
i
turned
a
corner
there
came
into
view
a
large
white
with
a
domed
roof
supported
by
columns
a
kind
of
temple
such
as
one
often
finds
in
the
gardens
of
ancient
italian
villas
the
with
carved
escutcheons
was
a
fashion
of
the
seventeenth
century
as
i
peered
forward
i
saw
moroni
walking
in
the
full
light
approaching
the
place
from
which
a
dark
figure
emerged
and
came
forth
to
meet
him
instantly
i
again
halted
and
straining
my
eyes
recognized
that
the
man
who
was
in
evening
dress
was
the
owner
of
that
palatial
home
they
retired
into
the
together
what
i
wondered
was
the
object
of
that
secret
meeting
it
struck
me
that
perhaps
if
i
succeeded
in
approaching
the
spot
i
might
overhear
some
of
their
confidential
conversation
therefore
i
stole
forward
always
keeping
in
the
shadow
and
treading
upon
the
grass
my
eyes
ever
upon
my
goal
the
stillness
of
the
night
was
unbroken
save
by
the
harsh
clanging
of
the
convent
bell
down
at
san
domenico
and
the
howl
of
a
distant
dog
while
ever
and
anon
bursts
of
dance
music
from
the
villa
reached
my
ears
at
last
by
skirting
a
shrubbery
in
almost
pitch
darkness
and
scratching
my
hands
and
face
badly
i
succeeded
in
gaining
the
rear
of
the
little
marble
temple
and
on
hearing
de
gex
voice
i
drew
back
and
waited
scarce
daring
to
breathe
i
could
hear
my
own
heart
beat
as
i
listened
intently
to
certain
words
distinctly
audible
then
you
think
he
has
suspicions
eh
moroni
what
you
tell
me
is
interesting
but
also
alarming
i
feel
certain
he
has
he
would
not
have
consulted
me
for
an
imaginary
ailment
were
it
not
so
then
he
must
have
seen
her
somewhere
in
florence
and
recognized
her
i
was
a
fool
to
suggest
that
she
should
be
brought
here
so
near
to
me
i
was
a
fool
to
allow
him
to
slip
through
my
fingers
i
pointed
that
out
to
you
at
the
time
remarked
the
italian
doctor
with
a
sigh
but
what
you
have
just
shown
to
me
is
amazing
i
never
dreamed
of
that
he
had
evidently
shown
him
something
in
the
moonlight
well
i
do
intend
that
this
fellow
shall
pry
into
my
affairs
snapped
the
millionaire
i
recognized
that
hard
metallic
voice
of
his
and
it
recalled
to
me
all
those
strange
happenings
on
that
november
night
i
do
not
really
see
if
we
act
boldly
what
we
have
to
fear
said
the
doctor
in
his
very
fair
english
we
then
they
were
both
implicated
in
the
plot
whatever
its
nature
fear
echoed
de
gex
suppose
he
made
some
very
compromising
statement
to
the
london
police
and
in
doing
so
he
would
compromise
himself
he
posed
as
a
medical
man
and
gave
the
death
certificate
in
return
for
payment
five
thousand
pounds
beyond
he
committed
forgery
by
signing
the
name
of
gordon
garfield
no
de
gex
i
feel
sure
he
will
never
court
prosecution
he
may
busy
himself
in
trying
to
solve
what
no
doubt
appears
to
him
a
complete
enigma
as
indeed
it
is
to
us
but
he
will
never
expose
us
the
millionaire
grunted
dubiously
well
what
are
we
to
do
now
what
do
you
suggest
moroni
your
brain
is
always
so
fertile
where
crooked
business
is
concerned
i
have
no
suggestion
i
came
here
to
learn
yours
yes
i
called
you
here
to
show
you
what
i
have
shown
you
and
also
because
i
have
a
certain
person
here
as
guest
at
my
wife
dance
you
know
whom
i
mean
certainly
she
is
equally
dangerous
you
asked
me
to
bring
the
little
tube
here
it
is
but
i
urge
you
to
use
it
with
extreme
caution
when
you
break
the
glass
be
certain
that
none
of
the
jelly
inside
touches
your
fingers
if
it
does
wash
them
instantly
in
carbolic
it
is
highly
contagious
de
gex
gave
vent
to
a
queer
laugh
of
satisfaction
as
no
doubt
he
took
the
mysterious
glass
tube
in
his
hand
i
am
not
yet
certain
whether
to
try
the
experiment
or
not
he
remarked
with
hesitation
it
is
to
say
the
least
a
highly
dangerous
one
you
mean
dangerous
from
the
point
of
view
of
discovery
eh
no
not
at
all
your
act
can
not
be
discovered
but
it
may
be
dangerous
for
yourself
and
those
about
you
highly
dangerous
i
have
obeyed
your
orders
signore
as
i
always
do
and
i
have
brought
it
but
my
suggestion
is
that
you
should
not
break
that
tube
and
disperse
its
contents
you
seem
to
be
growing
unusually
apprehensive
my
dear
moroni
the
appearance
in
florence
of
this
young
electrical
engineer
seems
to
have
quite
upset
you
he
laughed
harshly
i
could
hear
every
word
i
confess
his
presence
here
has
not
inspired
me
with
confidence
we
do
not
know
the
extent
of
his
knowledge
or
what
he
has
discovered
replied
the
doctor
if
he
establishes
one
fact
you
know
to
what
i
refer
then
he
will
become
a
very
grave
menace
to
us
both
but
surely
he
wo
dare
to
reveal
anything
for
his
own
sake
that
is
why
i
made
the
bribe
a
substantial
one
if
he
established
that
one
fact
to
which
i
have
referred
then
it
would
be
quite
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
he
might
face
the
music
and
lay
bare
the
whole
facts
of
the
mystery
of
stretton
street
moroni
remarked
in
a
rather
lower
tone
at
present
i
think
he
will
keep
a
still
tongue
then
one
thing
is
quite
plain
said
the
millionaire
he
must
not
be
allowed
to
prosecute
his
inquiries
any
further
and
it
is
for
you
moroni
to
rid
us
of
this
menace
if
he
is
allowed
to
go
on
then
we
shall
one
day
awake
to
find
our
secret
revealed
i
quite
agree
but
how
shall
we
act
ah
i
leave
that
to
you
replied
de
gex
you
have
many
ways
and
means
within
your
power
he
is
a
patient
of
yours
he
added
grimly
yes
but
i
happen
to
know
that
he
is
sufficiently
wide
awake
not
to
take
any
of
my
mixtures
ah
then
he
suspects
you
you
must
act
with
greatest
caution
moroni
act
as
you
will
but
we
must
at
all
costs
get
rid
of
this
fellow
i
suggested
that
after
the
affair
at
stretton
street
it
would
then
have
been
so
very
easy
i
know
i
was
a
fool
i
did
not
foresee
the
consequences
if
he
met
and
recognized
the
girl
even
now
we
do
not
know
where
and
how
he
met
her
but
the
menace
to
us
is
the
same
we
must
get
rid
of
him
and
quickly
too
the
trap
must
be
baited
and
what
better
bait
than
the
girl
herself
chapter
the
eighth
little
cullerton
for
nearly
half
an
hour
oswald
de
gex
and
the
italian
doctor
moroni
sat
chatting
in
the
darkness
de
gex
apologized
to
his
visitor
for
not
offering
him
a
cigarette
remarking
that
the
striking
of
a
match
might
reveal
their
presence
to
anyone
strolling
in
the
grounds
for
guests
at
dances
frequently
have
that
habit
indeed
after
you
have
gone
moroni
i
am
meeting
the
lady
whom
i
mentioned
and
shall
walk
with
her
outside
here
i
want
to
speak
with
her
in
private
but
surely
that
is
dangerous
exclaimed
the
doctor
instantly
why
if
you
intend
to
act
as
you
say
you
should
not
hold
any
clandestine
meeting
with
her
moroni
suggested
i
shall
take
your
advice
and
preserve
this
little
tube
intact
and
he
paused
intact
at
least
for
the
present
he
added
hence
there
can
be
no
harm
in
leaving
the
ballroom
and
coming
out
into
the
fresh
air
eh
in
that
case
i
see
no
risk
the
only
risk
we
run
is
in
allowing
young
garfield
to
make
inquiries
here
in
florence
when
he
saw
me
i
of
course
denied
everything
but
i
know
that
he
must
have
noticed
how
upset
i
was
at
his
reappearance
well
we
have
decided
to
suppress
him
have
we
not
said
moroni
briefly
and
now
it
is
getting
late
and
my
taxi
is
awaiting
me
down
in
fiesole
so
i
had
better
be
going
have
a
care
that
the
fellow
does
not
meet
her
not
until
you
are
quite
prepared
the
millionaire
urged
and
lose
no
time
in
making
ready
each
day
delay
is
increasingly
dangerous
i
do
not
disregard
the
fact
signore
replied
the
italian
and
next
moment
they
emerged
from
the
little
greek
temple
and
having
walked
a
short
distance
they
parted
de
gex
returning
to
the
house
while
moroni
made
his
way
back
past
the
lake
to
the
gate
when
the
mysterious
millionaire
had
disappeared
i
approached
the
broad
terrace
which
ran
along
the
side
of
the
house
from
which
such
a
wonderful
panorama
of
the
apennines
was
to
be
obtained
if
he
brought
his
lady
guest
out
as
was
his
intention
then
he
no
doubt
would
descend
from
the
terrace
for
i
saw
two
couples
walking
there
as
i
approached
beneath
a
tree
i
took
cover
and
waited
waited
to
establish
the
identity
of
the
person
whom
he
had
marked
down
as
his
next
victim
that
night
i
had
gained
much
knowledge
of
intense
interest
yet
it
all
served
to
puzzle
me
the
more
that
tito
moroni
was
his
accomplice
i
had
established
beyond
doubt
and
equally
that
there
had
been
a
grave
and
conspiracy
against
me
and
further
it
seemed
to
be
intended
that
i
should
again
meet
the
mysterious
girl
in
black
and
that
the
meeting
was
meant
to
be
fatal
to
me
fortune
had
certainly
been
upon
my
side
that
night
otherwise
i
might
have
acted
in
good
faith
and
fallen
into
some
trap
that
the
doctor
of
the
via
cavezzo
was
a
dangerous
malefactor
was
proved
by
the
airy
manner
in
which
he
had
brought
to
his
rich
client
that
little
glass
tube
which
i
of
course
had
not
seen
but
which
he
had
no
doubt
put
into
the
hands
of
his
wealthy
and
unscrupulous
host
the
more
i
reflected
as
i
stood
beneath
the
great
oleander
the
more
puzzled
did
i
become
what
was
it
that
de
gex
had
shown
the
doctor
beneath
the
pale
light
of
the
moon
it
was
evidently
something
which
greatly
surprised
moroni
and
yet
he
had
made
but
little
comment
concerning
it
but
the
chief
mystery
of
all
was
the
whereabouts
of
that
poor
inert
girl
gabrielle
engledue
i
waited
eager
for
the
return
of
the
tall
man
in
evening
clothes
the
man
who
so
much
in
the
public
eye
was
engaged
in
such
a
strange
career
of
wickedness
and
crime
it
seemed
incredible
that
the
immensely
rich
man
whose
name
was
so
constantly
in
the
papers
as
a
generous
patron
of
the
arts
and
a
pious
philanthropist
should
be
implicated
in
such
devil
doings
as
those
of
which
i
had
already
proved
him
to
be
the
author
the
discordant
clanging
of
that
again
aroused
me
to
a
sense
of
my
surroundings
i
saw
upon
the
terrace
before
me
several
men
strolling
smoking
cigarettes
and
with
them
their
fair
partners
wrapped
in
rich
cloaks
and
furs
they
had
come
out
after
supper
to
admire
the
wonderful
moonlit
scene
for
before
them
rose
the
mountains
in
a
long
serrated
range
the
high
apennines
which
divide
the
adriatic
from
the
mediterranean
suddenly
almost
before
i
was
aware
of
it
a
man
and
a
woman
passed
close
to
me
the
figure
revealed
by
the
cold
bright
moon
was
that
of
de
gex
who
had
now
put
on
a
light
coat
while
at
his
side
walked
a
slim
tall
young
woman
wrapped
warmly
in
a
rich
fur
coat
the
diamonds
in
her
fair
hair
gleamed
in
the
moonlight
but
unfortunately
she
had
passed
into
the
shadow
before
i
could
gain
a
glimpse
of
her
features
so
that
was
the
intended
victim
the
woman
to
whom
the
dangerous
contents
of
that
tiny
glass
tube
was
one
day
sooner
or
later
to
be
administered
they
went
forward
towards
the
edge
of
the
placid
lake
hence
i
sprang
upon
the
grass
and
followed
them
as
noiseless
as
a
cat
little
did
the
owner
of
the
great
villa
clementini
dream
that
i
was
lurking
in
such
close
vicinity
they
halted
beside
one
of
the
ancient
statues
of
yellow
marble
a
representation
of
bacchus
crowned
with
vine
leaves
where
they
admired
the
scene
it
was
indeed
glorious
beneath
the
pale
moonlight
lay
the
placid
lake
like
a
mirror
for
no
breath
stirred
from
the
mountains
and
beyond
in
the
mystic
light
rose
the
peaks
far
away
beyond
the
chestnut
forests
of
vallombrosa
there
is
a
charm
in
all
seasons
and
at
all
hours
about
those
ancient
villas
of
tuscany
those
country
mansions
of
the
nobles
which
have
seen
the
tramp
of
men
in
armour
and
in
plush
and
bear
upon
them
the
crumbling
escutcheons
of
races
which
have
been
rulers
for
five
centuries
and
whose
present
descendants
are
perhaps
waiters
in
paris
london
or
new
york
the
english
visitors
to
florence
see
outside
the
florence
club
effeminate
elegants
in
suits
of
blue
serge
and
brown
boots
and
they
sigh
to
think
that
such
specimens
of
humanity
are
the
representatives
of
a
noble
race
disguise
it
as
you
may
poor
italy
is
sadly
decadent
her
glory
has
passed
her
are
ruined
and
her
labour
enemies
are
alas
bent
upon
putting
her
into
the
the
gallant
italian
army
fought
valiantly
against
the
tedesci
it
saved
venice
from
the
heel
of
the
invader
and
it
protected
dalmatia
where
the
population
are
italians
but
italy
is
not
italy
of
days
thanks
to
its
paid
agitators
and
its
political
scandals
with
the
bright
moon
shining
across
the
huge
oleander
beneath
which
i
had
again
taken
cover
i
listened
intently
but
de
gex
speaking
with
his
guest
was
too
far
off
for
me
to
distinguish
anything
he
said
that
he
treated
her
with
the
greatest
courtesy
was
apparent
and
that
he
spoke
to
her
with
the
most
entire
confidence
i
realized
by
my
own
observation
at
once
i
stole
noiselessly
forward
from
one
bush
to
another
until
i
was
close
to
where
the
pair
stood
i
trod
softly
upon
the
grass
my
ears
strained
to
catch
any
word
the
words
i
at
last
caught
were
few
and
uncertain
for
de
gex
was
speaking
in
a
low
and
highly
confidential
tone
at
last
however
on
approaching
a
little
nearer
i
heard
him
exclaim
jack
your
husband
is
a
young
fool
he
has
no
discretion
he
gambles
on
the
stock
exchange
without
any
expert
knowledge
he
came
up
here
to
me
yesterday
afternoon
and
told
me
that
he
must
have
ten
thousand
pounds
to
tide
him
over
and
prevent
him
being
hammered
i
sent
him
away
but
i
shall
see
that
he
has
the
money
how
really
good
of
you
de
gex
exclaimed
the
girl
for
as
far
as
i
could
see
she
was
hardly
a
woman
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
sufficiently
i
know
jack
is
a
born
gambler
his
father
was
on
the
stock
exchange
before
him
and
i
suppose
games
of
chance
are
in
the
breed
of
the
cullertons
not
in
you
i
hope
dorothy
replied
the
millionaire
you
have
had
the
misfortune
to
marry
a
gambler
and
well
my
dear
girl
i
pity
you
gambling
is
worse
than
drink
the
drunkard
can
be
sickened
and
put
off
but
the
gambler
never
now
i
want
you
to
promise
me
one
thing
what
is
that
she
asked
i
shall
see
that
he
has
the
money
but
it
will
come
through
a
second
party
not
through
me
i
do
not
wish
to
appear
to
lend
him
money
otherwise
he
will
still
continue
his
speculations
feeling
that
he
has
me
behind
him
now
you
know
the
truth
dorothy
but
you
must
promise
me
to
say
nothing
nobody
must
know
not
even
my
wife
oh
how
very
good
of
you
to
help
jack
out
of
a
hole
she
exclaimed
of
course
i
remain
silent
but
it
really
is
awfully
kind
of
you
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
i
will
do
it
for
your
sake
dorothy
said
de
gex
bending
to
her
in
confidence
i
am
indebted
to
remember
ah
no
cried
the
young
woman
whose
name
apparently
was
cullerton
no
please
do
refer
to
that
terrible
affair
her
voice
betrayed
emotion
and
apprehension
while
at
that
moment
as
she
turned
her
face
to
the
light
of
the
moon
i
was
able
to
get
a
full
view
of
it
it
was
that
of
a
very
beautiful
young
woman
of
about
rather
with
fair
bobbed
hair
regular
features
and
sweet
lips
but
the
expression
upon
her
countenance
was
one
of
fear
and
apprehension
i
have
no
desire
to
remember
it
said
her
host
we
agreed
at
the
time
that
it
should
be
silence
for
silence
it
was
a
bargain
which
we
have
kept
ever
since
you
have
married
jack
cullerton
and
you
are
happy
except
that
your
husband
is
a
born
gambler
and
of
that
he
must
be
cured
i
know
i
know
she
said
hastily
but
earlier
this
evening
you
promised
to
tell
me
about
gabrielle
i
must
see
her
she
seems
to
have
disappeared
where
is
she
in
london
i
believe
in
london
yet
the
last
time
you
spoke
of
her
you
said
she
was
in
turin
on
her
way
here
to
florence
oswald
de
gex
laughed
lightly
yes
she
came
to
florence
for
a
few
days
but
she
has
returned
to
london
why
are
you
so
anxious
to
see
her
i
want
to
see
her
about
a
matter
which
concerns
jack
and
myself
that
all
replied
young
cullerton
may
i
not
know
asked
her
host
it
is
a
purely
private
matter
was
her
reply
then
from
the
conversation
that
followed
it
seemed
as
though
the
millionaire
was
apprehensive
lest
she
should
meet
the
mysterious
gabrielle
and
i
wondered
whether
it
was
in
order
to
prevent
them
meeting
that
he
entertained
designs
upon
her
life
i
recollected
that
little
glass
tube
which
he
was
carrying
in
secret
in
his
pocket
and
which
the
scoundrelly
italian
had
urged
him
to
refrain
from
using
because
he
might
place
his
own
life
in
jeopardy
i
listened
to
every
word
de
gex
was
evidently
most
anxious
to
know
why
she
sought
gabrielle
so
eagerly
and
gabrielle
i
could
only
surmise
was
the
girl
i
had
seen
stark
and
dead
in
that
handsome
room
in
stretton
street
that
night
of
watchfulness
had
borne
fruit
i
had
learnt
from
de
own
lips
that
another
deep
and
subtle
trap
was
to
be
laid
for
me
a
trap
baited
with
the
girl
herself
further
i
had
established
that
he
intended
that
sooner
or
later
an
accident
should
befall
the
dainty
little
woman
in
that
rich
ermine
cloak
the
woman
with
whom
he
was
chatting
so
affably
also
i
had
learned
her
identity
and
it
now
remained
for
me
to
forewarn
her
of
what
was
intended
the
rich
englishman
had
talked
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
with
dorothy
cullerton
when
at
last
they
returned
to
the
house
while
i
made
my
way
in
the
darkness
back
to
the
gate
when
i
arrived
however
i
found
that
moroni
had
locked
it
after
him
i
was
therefore
compelled
to
climb
the
wrought
ironwork
and
after
several
unsuccessful
attempts
succeeded
in
regaining
the
road
it
was
long
past
midnight
ere
i
found
myself
back
in
fiesole
but
i
discovered
a
belated
cab
and
in
it
i
drove
back
to
florence
full
of
grave
reflections
on
the
following
day
i
bought
in
the
via
tornabuoni
an
english
newspaper
which
publishes
weekly
a
list
of
visitors
to
florence
and
from
it
discovered
that
and
cullerton
were
living
at
the
villa
tassi
out
at
montaguto
about
three
miles
from
the
porta
romana
on
the
opposite
side
of
florence
that
same
morning
i
took
the
steam
tram
from
the
piazza
della
signorina
and
after
three
miles
of
dusty
road
alighted
at
a
spot
beyond
the
little
village
of
galluzzo
in
the
val
crossing
the
brook
i
soon
began
to
ascend
the
hill
of
montaguto
a
pretty
eminence
clothed
with
cypresses
and
olives
and
was
not
long
in
discovering
the
neat
little
villa
one
of
a
number
which
are
let
furnished
each
season
to
wealthy
foreigners
i
noted
as
i
passed
that
it
was
that
the
garden
was
bright
with
flowers
even
though
it
was
winter
and
that
in
the
garage
was
a
small
light
car
which
at
the
moment
was
being
washed
by
an
english
chauffeur
i
longed
to
have
some
excuse
to
call
upon
cullerton
but
could
think
of
none
therefore
i
returned
to
florence
and
pursued
fresh
tactics
the
afternoon
i
spent
making
inquiries
regarding
the
cullertons
and
soon
discovered
that
they
were
intimate
friends
of
monsieur
rameil
the
french
consul
and
his
wife
with
this
knowledge
i
lost
no
time
in
obtaining
an
introduction
to
the
french
consul
and
three
days
later
received
a
card
for
one
of
madame
friday
afternoons
naturally
i
went
and
to
my
delight
cullerton
was
there
also
she
was
a
strikingly
pretty
young
woman
and
apparently
extremely
popular
judging
by
the
manner
in
which
two
or
three
young
italian
elegants
danced
attendance
upon
her
shortly
before
i
left
my
hostess
introduced
me
to
her
and
naturally
i
endeavoured
to
make
myself
extremely
agreeable
but
was
not
the
situation
a
strange
one
and
this
pretty
woman
had
been
marked
down
for
destruction
by
the
mysterious
millionaire
just
as
i
had
been
yet
had
i
told
anyone
of
the
knowledge
i
had
gained
i
would
not
have
been
believed
any
more
than
would
credence
have
been
given
to
the
story
of
my
strange
adventure
in
stretton
street
we
chatted
for
perhaps
ten
minutes
she
asked
me
where
i
was
staying
and
how
long
i
should
be
in
florence
and
then
expressing
a
hope
that
we
should
meet
again
i
bowed
and
left
her
i
had
accomplished
one
step
towards
ascertaining
the
identity
of
the
girl
i
had
seen
dead
in
london
several
days
passed
during
which
i
kept
a
good
look
out
in
the
streets
for
sight
of
doctor
moroni
fair
companion
but
i
was
not
successful
perhaps
she
had
gone
to
london
as
my
host
of
stretton
street
had
asserted
one
afternoon
while
haunting
the
streets
i
suddenly
encountered
cullerton
walking
in
the
via
tornabuoni
and
raising
my
hat
stopped
to
speak
after
a
few
seconds
she
recognized
me
and
i
walked
at
her
side
chatting
her
car
was
waiting
in
the
piazza
santa
trinita
but
before
she
entered
it
she
had
promised
to
send
me
a
card
for
a
little
at
home
she
was
giving
on
the
following
thursday
now
not
until
we
had
parted
did
it
occur
to
me
that
de
gex
might
be
also
going
there
in
that
case
he
certainly
should
not
meet
me
so
i
sought
robertson
aid
concerning
his
master
engagements
and
discovered
that
on
thursday
morning
the
millionaire
was
going
to
leghorn
to
join
his
yacht
for
a
week
cruise
across
to
algiers
therefore
i
accepted
cullerton
invitation
and
found
at
the
villa
a
number
of
pleasant
cosmopolitan
people
whom
i
had
already
met
at
the
french
consul
i
was
introduced
by
my
hostess
to
her
husband
jack
a
man
and
a
typical
young
member
of
the
stock
exchange
afterwards
i
succeeded
in
having
quite
a
long
conversation
with
his
wife
quite
casually
i
mentioned
the
villa
clementini
and
its
owner
do
you
know
him
she
asked
with
interest
he
is
such
a
dear
generous
old
thing
i
have
met
him
once
i
replied
with
affected
unconcern
they
say
he
a
little
eccentric
do
they
his
enemies
say
that
she
replied
but
his
friends
are
full
of
praise
of
him
he
the
most
charming
and
generous
of
men
and
his
great
wealth
allows
him
to
perform
all
sorts
of
kind
actions
they
say
that
he
ca
refuse
anybody
who
asks
for
his
influence
or
help
i
reflected
that
his
influence
was
certainly
a
baneful
one
ah
i
see
you
are
one
of
his
friends
mrs
cullerton
i
said
laughing
yes
i
confess
i
am
then
would
you
be
surprised
if
i
told
you
in
strictest
confidence
that
he
is
not
your
friend
but
one
of
your
bitterest
enemies
i
said
lowering
my
voice
and
looking
straight
into
her
blue
eyes
i
do
understand
you
mr
garfield
she
said
also
lowering
her
voice
i
will
explain
one
day
cullerton
one
day
when
we
are
alone
when
she
whispered
for
madame
rameil
was
approaching
at
the
moment
whenever
you
like
to
make
an
appointment
i
replied
only
i
must
first
hold
you
to
absolute
secrecy
that
agreed
whispered
the
pretty
young
woman
i
will
be
here
alone
at
three
and
then
she
held
out
her
hand
and
aloud
said
garfield
so
sorry
you
have
to
run
away
so
early
chapter
the
ninth
some
plain
speaking
punctually
at
three
next
afternoon
the
buxom
italian
maid
in
dainty
apron
ushered
me
into
cullerton
charming
from
the
long
windows
a
magnificent
view
spread
away
across
the
green
valley
of
the
ema
to
the
great
monastery
of
the
certosa
a
huge
mediæval
pile
which
resembled
a
mediæval
fortress
standing
boldly
against
the
background
of
the
rolling
apennines
scarcely
had
i
stood
there
a
moment
when
my
young
hostess
in
a
becoming
frock
entered
and
greeting
me
closed
the
door
well
garfield
it
really
awfully
good
of
you
to
trouble
to
come
out
to
see
me
i
all
excitement
to
know
what
you
have
to
tell
me
about
de
gex
he
gone
yachting
as
you
perhaps
know
do
sit
down
as
i
did
so
she
passed
me
the
cigarettes
and
took
one
herself
then
when
i
had
held
the
match
for
her
and
had
lit
my
own
i
said
well
cullerton
i
really
do
know
how
to
commence
somehow
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
come
here
to
see
you
i
must
admit
that
i
have
been
manoeuvring
for
several
days
in
order
to
get
an
introduction
to
you
and
to
obtain
an
opportunity
of
seeing
you
alone
and
yet
yes
i
quite
see
that
i
thought
by
your
attitude
in
the
via
tornabuoni
that
you
seemed
very
anxious
to
know
me
and
her
lips
relaxed
into
a
pretty
smile
that
is
so
in
order
to
well
to
warn
you
i
said
very
seriously
warn
me
of
what
pray
i
hesitated
to
be
perfectly
frank
with
her
was
i
saw
quite
impossible
she
might
hear
all
i
said
and
then
inform
de
gex
she
was
his
friend
or
perhaps
she
would
dismiss
me
and
my
story
as
pure
invention
hence
i
resolved
to
preserve
my
own
secret
concerning
the
stretton
street
affair
looking
straight
into
her
face
i
said
i
here
to
warn
you
of
a
very
grave
personal
danger
you
are
really
most
alarming
garfield
she
said
in
suspicion
in
what
danger
am
i
you
are
either
in
possession
of
some
ugly
fact
concerning
de
gex
which
he
desires
suppressed
or
else
you
bar
his
way
to
some
ambitious
achievement
her
face
changed
and
she
held
her
breath
though
it
was
only
for
a
second
i
saw
that
what
i
had
suggested
was
the
truth
her
slim
white
hand
twitched
nervously
upon
her
lap
some
fact
concerning
de
gex
she
gasped
in
feigned
surprise
who
told
you
that
she
asked
her
face
blanching
i
have
not
been
told
but
i
know
it
cullerton
was
my
reply
i
know
that
though
de
gex
is
assisting
your
husband
out
of
a
financial
difficulty
and
pretends
to
be
your
good
friend
he
views
you
as
his
bitter
enemy
as
a
person
whose
lips
must
at
all
hazards
be
closed
really
garfield
what
you
say
is
too
extraordinary
too
amazing
i
do
understand
you
i
know
it
sounds
most
extraordinary
i
said
but
first
tell
me
if
you
know
a
certain
doctor
moroni
who
lives
in
the
via
cavezzo
certainly
the
doctor
attends
de
gex
and
his
family
i
first
met
him
in
london
about
a
year
ago
de
gex
holds
him
in
very
high
esteem
ah
then
you
know
the
doctor
of
course
when
he
was
in
london
he
several
times
came
to
our
house
in
fitzjohn
avenue
and
your
husband
knows
him
i
asked
looking
her
straight
in
the
face
please
tell
me
the
truth
i
urged
no
jack
has
never
met
him
not
to
my
knowledge
i
was
silent
for
a
few
seconds
i
had
established
a
fact
which
i
had
all
along
suspected
then
he
called
in
the
daytime
when
your
husband
was
in
the
city
eh
yes
now
tell
me
did
you
ever
have
any
strange
illness
after
doctor
moroni
had
called
i
inquired
very
seriously
illness
why
no
why
do
you
ask
such
a
curious
question
i
have
reasons
for
asking
it
cullerton
was
my
reply
i
have
called
here
as
your
friend
remember
but
all
this
is
most
bewildering
she
exclaimed
with
a
nervous
little
laugh
why
should
i
be
in
any
personal
peril
because
you
know
something
to
the
detriment
of
that
wealthy
and
somewhat
eccentric
man
i
replied
pardon
me
if
i
put
another
question
to
you
are
you
acquainted
with
a
girl
named
gabrielle
engledue
gabrielle
engledue
she
repeated
no
i
have
never
heard
the
name
i
know
a
gabrielle
gabrielle
tennison
an
old
schoolfellow
of
mine
a
tall
girl
yes
she
is
rather
tall
and
is
her
real
name
engledue
i
asked
quickly
not
to
my
knowledge
is
she
not
de
gex
niece
he
has
no
niece
has
he
except
of
course
lady
shalford
whom
i
know
quite
well
where
is
gabrielle
tennison
in
london
i
believe
are
you
certain
she
is
not
here
in
florence
de
gex
told
me
that
she
came
to
florence
for
a
few
days
to
visit
him
eh
i
suppose
so
but
she
has
returned
to
london
do
you
know
her
address
in
london
i
asked
very
anxiously
i
ask
you
this
in
our
mutual
interests
cullerton
i
added
confidentially
yes
she
lives
with
her
mother
in
a
maisonette
in
longridge
road
earl
court
i
forget
the
number
but
you
could
easily
find
out
and
she
is
there
now
i
presume
i
expect
so
if
what
de
gex
has
told
me
is
the
truth
but
will
he
ever
tell
you
the
truth
i
queried
recollect
that
although
he
poses
as
your
husband
friend
he
is
nevertheless
your
enemy
because
he
fears
you
why
is
that
the
pretty
wife
of
the
young
london
stockbroker
hesitated
i
saw
that
she
was
much
perturbed
by
my
question
i
suppose
he
suspects
that
i
know
certain
things
was
her
low
hard
reply
but
he
has
been
very
good
to
jack
on
several
occasions
he
has
prevented
him
from
being
hammered
on
the
stock
exchange
therefore
i
can
only
be
grateful
to
him
i
looked
the
pretty
woman
straight
in
the
face
and
said
grateful
grateful
to
a
man
whose
dastardly
intention
is
when
the
whim
takes
him
to
send
you
to
your
grave
mrs
cullerton
i
i
really
do
know
what
you
mean
are
you
mad
do
be
more
explicit
she
cried
why
do
you
make
these
terrible
allegations
against
de
gex
please
recollect
cullerton
that
i
am
here
first
in
your
interests
and
secondly
in
my
own
you
and
i
are
now
both
marked
down
as
victims
because
both
of
us
are
in
possession
of
certain
knowledge
which
would
if
exposed
bring
obloquy
and
prosecution
upon
an
exceedingly
wealthy
man
your
husband
yourself
and
myself
are
merely
pawns
in
the
clever
game
which
this
man
is
playing
a
mysterious
game
i
admit
and
one
in
which
he
is
actively
assisted
by
doctor
moroni
but
also
one
in
which
if
we
are
not
both
very
wary
we
shall
find
ourselves
the
victims
of
fatal
circumstances
my
words
seemed
to
impress
the
stockbroker
wife
for
she
asked
well
what
shall
i
do
be
perfectly
frank
with
me
i
replied
promptly
both
of
us
have
all
to
lose
if
we
close
our
eyes
to
the
conspiracy
against
us
on
the
part
of
your
friend
de
gex
and
his
shrewd
and
unscrupulous
accomplice
tito
moroni
moroni
is
one
of
the
most
popular
doctors
in
florence
she
remarked
i
perfectly
aware
of
that
was
my
reply
but
there
is
no
more
dangerous
criminal
than
the
medical
man
who
is
beneath
the
thumb
of
a
millionaire
there
have
been
several
before
the
assizes
in
various
cities
of
europe
many
thanks
alas
to
the
power
of
gold
have
never
been
unmasked
there
have
been
cases
in
hungary
in
france
in
italy
and
in
russia
even
one
case
in
england
which
is
recorded
in
a
big
file
at
scotland
yard
but
in
that
case
there
was
no
prosecution
because
money
means
influence
and
influence
means
the
breaking
of
those
in
office
who
dare
to
oppose
it
then
how
do
you
suggest
that
i
should
act
mr
garfield
asked
young
cullerton
it
is
distressing
news
to
me
that
de
gex
is
my
enemy
and
i
confess
that
at
present
i
can
scarcely
credit
it
i
longed
to
unbosom
myself
to
her
to
tell
her
of
all
that
had
occurred
to
me
since
that
fateful
november
night
when
i
had
passed
through
stretton
street
but
i
was
not
yet
fully
confident
concerning
her
attitude
towards
me
it
might
be
hostile
she
might
seek
de
gex
when
he
returned
from
algiers
and
tell
him
of
our
interview
if
she
did
then
all
hope
of
elucidating
the
mystery
of
gabrielle
death
would
be
at
once
swept
away
yet
i
held
before
me
the
fact
that
the
millionaire
with
that
scoundrelly
italian
intended
to
cast
me
into
my
grave
the
italians
have
all
through
the
centuries
been
experts
in
secret
assassination
the
doges
of
venice
the
borgias
and
the
medici
have
all
had
secret
poisoners
in
their
pay
the
gay
careless
race
which
laughs
when
the
sun
shines
are
just
the
same
after
the
war
as
they
were
in
the
days
of
his
holiness
rodrigo
borgia
your
superstitious
italian
criminal
enters
the
church
and
prays
to
the
madonna
that
his
whatever
it
may
be
from
profiteering
picking
pockets
or
the
secret
assassination
of
an
enemy
may
be
successful
i
allege
that
de
gex
is
your
enemy
cullerton
i
said
i
have
knowledge
of
it
indeed
on
the
night
of
the
ball
at
the
villa
clementini
he
had
in
his
pocket
the
wherewithal
to
bring
upon
you
an
illness
which
must
inevitably
prove
fatal
he
had
a
little
glass
tube
which
he
had
ordered
moroni
to
prepare
but
which
the
doctor
himself
urged
him
not
to
break
for
fear
of
infecting
himself
and
his
family
she
sat
staring
at
me
i
i
really
ca
believe
it
she
gasped
de
gex
would
never
act
in
such
a
dastardly
manner
towards
me
we
are
friends
old
friends
you
may
be
but
i
happen
to
know
the
truth
i
declared
he
pretends
friendship
towards
you
but
his
intentions
are
that
your
lips
shall
be
closed
for
some
reason
he
fears
you
are
you
really
quite
serious
she
asked
looking
me
full
in
the
face
i
certainly
am
i
replied
the
reason
i
am
here
is
to
warn
you
to
have
a
care
of
yourself
that
some
evil
is
intended
i
know
only
i
rely
upon
you
to
keep
the
information
i
have
given
you
to
yourself
watch
de
gex
but
say
nothing
a
i
have
already
promised
that
i
will
remain
silent
she
remarked
you
must
also
say
no
word
to
your
husband
he
is
indebted
to
de
gex
hence
he
might
tell
him
what
i
have
said
and
further
my
name
must
never
be
mentioned
to
de
gex
why
not
he
would
instantly
guess
the
source
of
your
information
but
what
is
your
motive
for
all
this
mr
garfield
my
motive
is
a
simple
one
i
am
trying
to
find
gabrielle
engledue
and
i
am
now
wondering
whether
the
girl
i
am
seeking
is
not
the
same
as
the
young
lady
you
know
as
gabrielle
tennison
where
did
you
meet
this
girl
engledue
asked
cullerton
with
a
queer
inquisitive
look
i
paused
for
a
second
in
london
at
the
house
of
a
mutual
friend
her
expression
caused
me
to
ponder
for
i
discerned
that
she
was
inclined
to
doubt
me
and
why
are
you
seeking
her
now
i
have
a
distinct
object
in
view
you
well
perhaps
you
fallen
in
love
with
her
eh
she
laughed
lightly
not
at
all
i
assured
her
i
have
a
private
but
very
strong
motive
in
discovering
her
i
want
to
put
to
her
certain
questions
about
what
garfield
come
it
is
now
my
turn
to
be
a
little
inquisitive
and
she
laughed
again
about
a
certain
little
matter
in
which
we
are
mutually
interested
was
my
evasive
answer
then
after
a
pause
i
looked
straight
into
her
eyes
and
added
very
earnestly
i
wonder
whether
if
i
should
require
your
help
cullerton
you
would
assist
me
in
what
way
at
present
i
can
not
tell
to
be
frank
i
am
striving
to
solve
a
great
and
inscrutable
mystery
just
now
i
am
amazed
and
bewildered
but
i
feel
that
you
are
the
only
person
who
could
help
me
because
you
and
i
are
equally
in
peril
but
garfield
i
see
no
reason
why
i
should
be
upon
the
brink
of
this
mysterious
abyss
she
cried
you
do
explain
the
situation
sufficiently
fully
because
at
present
i
can
not
do
so
no
one
regrets
it
more
than
myself
there
is
a
grim
mystery
a
very
great
mystery
and
i
intend
with
your
assistance
to
escape
my
enemy
and
clear
it
up
who
is
your
enemy
oswald
de
gex
he
is
my
enemy
as
well
as
yours
i
said
very
seriously
if
you
were
in
the
possession
of
such
facts
as
those
i
have
gathered
during
the
past
week
or
so
you
would
be
startled
and
well
perhaps
terrified
but
i
only
again
beg
of
you
to
have
a
care
of
yourself
you
have
promised
silence
and
i
on
my
part
will
carry
on
my
search
for
the
truth
the
truth
of
what
the
truth
concerning
gabrielle
engledue
the
pretty
little
woman
again
looked
at
me
very
straight
in
the
face
for
some
moments
without
speaking
then
with
a
strange
hardness
about
her
mouth
she
said
garfield
take
it
from
me
you
will
never
discover
what
you
are
in
search
of
the
truth
is
too
well
hidden
what
then
you
know
something
eh
i
cried
quickly
yes
it
is
true
she
answered
in
a
low
hard
voice
i
do
know
something
something
of
a
certain
secret
that
can
never
pass
my
lips
chapter
the
tenth
monsieur
suzor
again
cullerton
words
held
me
breathless
at
first
i
believed
that
i
might
wring
the
truth
from
her
lips
but
i
quickly
saw
that
she
intended
to
preserve
her
secret
at
all
costs
whether
she
actually
believed
what
i
had
told
her
concerning
her
own
peril
was
doubtful
in
any
case
she
seemed
in
some
strange
manner
held
powerless
and
fascinated
by
the
rich
man
who
had
saved
her
speculating
husband
from
ruin
i
remained
there
for
still
another
quarter
of
an
hour
until
her
maid
announced
a
visitor
when
i
was
compelled
to
rise
and
take
my
leave
for
a
few
days
longer
i
remained
in
florence
then
i
left
for
london
on
entering
the
calais
express
at
the
gare
du
nord
in
paris
on
my
way
home
i
was
agreeably
surprised
to
find
among
my
fellow
travellers
to
england
the
affable
french
banker
whom
i
had
met
on
that
memorable
journey
from
york
to
london
he
recognized
me
at
once
and
i
inquired
why
he
was
not
as
usual
crossing
by
air
to
croydon
ah
he
laughed
the
last
time
i
crossed
three
weeks
ago
we
went
into
a
thick
fog
over
the
channel
and
it
was
not
very
comfortable
so
i
prefer
the
rail
just
now
on
this
occasion
we
exchanged
cards
his
name
was
gaston
suzor
and
between
paris
and
calais
we
discussed
many
things
for
he
was
a
man
and
a
true
hater
of
the
boches
on
the
steamer
we
strolled
upon
the
deck
together
and
we
passed
quite
a
pleasant
journey
in
company
he
was
surprised
that
i
had
been
in
italy
but
i
explained
that
i
had
been
granted
long
leave
of
absence
by
my
firm
and
that
i
had
gone
to
florence
upon
private
affairs
we
parted
at
charing
cross
monsieur
suzor
to
go
to
the
carlton
and
i
home
to
our
little
flat
in
rivermead
mansions
a
note
lay
upon
the
table
hambledon
was
away
in
cardiff
and
he
had
left
word
in
case
i
should
return
unexpectedly
the
place
was
cold
and
fireless
and
i
was
glad
to
go
over
to
the
claredon
to
have
my
dinner
my
one
thought
was
of
gabrielle
tennison
who
lived
with
her
mother
in
a
maisonette
at
earl
court
so
i
took
a
taxi
to
longridge
road
and
after
numerous
inquiries
at
neighbouring
shops
in
earl
court
road
i
discovered
in
which
house
lived
tennison
and
her
daughter
the
hour
was
late
therefore
i
felt
that
it
was
useless
to
keep
observation
upon
the
place
in
the
hope
of
the
girl
coming
forth
i
had
no
excuse
to
make
a
call
besides
i
might
if
i
acted
indiscreetly
destroy
all
my
chances
of
solving
the
strange
enigma
therefore
not
until
ten
on
the
following
morning
did
i
take
up
my
vigilant
watch
at
the
end
of
the
road
at
a
spot
from
which
i
had
full
view
of
the
house
in
question
my
watch
proved
a
long
and
weary
one
for
not
until
three
in
the
afternoon
was
my
patience
rewarded
the
front
door
suddenly
opened
and
down
the
steps
came
the
slim
figure
of
a
girl
followed
by
a
woman
as
they
approached
me
i
saw
that
it
was
the
girl
i
had
seen
with
moroni
in
florence
while
the
woman
was
from
her
dress
evidently
an
old
servant
the
girl
of
mystery
was
attired
quite
smartly
in
black
her
appearance
being
very
different
from
the
shabby
figure
she
presented
in
florence
but
her
beautiful
countenance
was
just
as
pathetic
with
that
strange
set
expression
of
ineffable
sadness
she
passed
me
by
without
glancing
at
me
while
the
stout
homely
woman
at
her
side
held
her
arm
linked
in
hers
they
turned
into
earl
court
road
and
walked
towards
kensington
high
street
while
i
followed
at
a
respectable
distance
i
could
not
fail
to
notice
the
grace
of
carriage
of
the
girl
whose
listless
attitude
was
so
mysterious
and
whose
exact
whereabouts
oswald
de
gex
was
concealing
from
his
friend
cullerton
but
the
one
point
which
puzzled
me
sorely
was
whether
the
girl
walking
in
front
of
me
all
unconscious
of
my
presence
was
the
same
that
i
had
seen
dead
at
stretton
street
and
for
whom
i
had
given
a
false
certificate
to
cover
up
what
had
evidently
been
a
crime
with
malice
aforethought
the
pair
now
and
then
became
lost
in
the
crowd
of
in
busy
kensington
but
i
followed
them
occasionally
they
paused
to
look
into
barker
shop
windows
but
the
interest
was
evidently
on
the
part
of
the
for
gabrielle
tennison
or
whatever
her
actual
name
seemed
to
evince
no
heed
of
things
about
her
she
walked
like
one
in
a
dream
with
her
thoughts
afar
off
yet
her
face
was
the
sweetest
most
beautiful
and
yet
the
saddest
i
had
ever
witnessed
tragedy
was
written
upon
her
pale
countenance
and
i
noticed
that
one
or
two
men
and
women
in
passing
the
pair
turned
to
look
back
at
them
in
that
face
of
flawless
beauty
a
strange
story
was
written
a
mystery
which
i
was
strenuously
seeking
to
solve
presently
they
entered
kensington
gardens
strolling
along
the
gravelled
walks
beneath
the
bare
leafless
trees
that
were
so
black
with
london
grime
the
day
was
cold
but
bright
hence
quite
a
number
of
persons
were
walking
there
together
with
the
usual
crowd
of
nursemaids
with
the
children
of
the
from
the
hyde
park
and
kensington
districts
the
pair
passed
leisurely
up
the
broad
walk
when
they
presently
rested
upon
a
seat
nearly
opposite
the
great
façade
of
kensington
palace
i
saw
that
i
had
not
been
noticed
either
by
the
old
servant
or
by
her
mysterious
young
mistress
therefore
i
sank
quickly
upon
a
seat
some
distance
away
but
in
such
a
position
that
i
could
still
see
them
as
they
talked
together
was
gabrielle
engledue
living
or
was
she
dead
or
was
gabrielle
tennison
and
gabrielle
engledue
one
and
the
same
person
a
living
face
is
different
from
that
of
the
same
person
when
dead
hence
the
great
problem
presenting
itself
it
seemed
as
though
in
conversation
the
girl
became
animated
for
she
gesticulated
slightly
as
though
in
angry
protest
at
some
remark
of
her
companion
and
then
suddenly
i
had
a
great
surprise
coming
down
the
broad
walk
i
saw
a
figure
in
a
grey
overcoat
and
soft
brown
hat
which
i
instantly
recognized
he
walked
straight
to
where
the
pair
were
seated
lifted
his
hat
and
then
seated
himself
beside
the
girl
the
man
was
my
french
friend
suzor
that
they
had
gone
there
on
purpose
to
meet
him
was
now
quite
clear
for
after
a
few
moments
the
old
woman
laughed
rose
and
walked
on
in
order
to
leave
the
girl
alone
with
the
frenchman
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
that
clandestine
meeting
for
clandestine
it
was
or
monsieur
suzor
would
have
called
at
longridge
road
possibly
they
expected
that
they
might
be
watched
hence
they
had
met
as
though
by
accident
at
that
spot
where
they
believed
they
would
not
be
observed
gaston
suzor
was
a
shrewd
clever
man
but
what
did
this
friendship
with
gabrielle
tennison
denote
as
i
watched
i
saw
him
speaking
very
earnestly
for
some
time
she
sat
with
her
gloved
hands
idly
in
her
lap
listening
to
his
words
without
comment
then
she
shook
her
head
and
put
up
her
hands
in
protest
afterwards
by
her
attitude
she
seemed
to
be
appealing
to
him
while
he
remained
obdurate
and
unperturbed
i
longed
to
overhear
their
conversation
but
in
the
fading
light
of
that
brief
wintry
afternoon
it
was
impossible
to
approach
closer
i
could
only
sit
and
watch
my
eyes
were
strained
to
see
every
gesture
of
the
pair
now
that
the
stout
figure
of
the
girl
companion
had
disappeared
towards
the
bayswater
road
in
that
oasis
in
the
desert
of
aristocratic
london
one
can
obtain
quite
sylvan
surroundings
true
the
trees
and
vegetation
are
covered
with
a
film
of
grime
from
the
millions
of
smoking
chimneys
of
the
giant
metropolis
still
kensington
gardens
ever
possesses
a
charm
all
its
own
as
a
clandestine
for
lovers
and
loafers
for
nursemaids
and
soldiers
and
for
persons
of
both
sexes
who
wish
for
a
little
quiet
talk
in
the
open
air
in
order
so
often
to
clear
a
hectic
atmosphere
such
i
judged
to
be
the
case
between
gaston
suzor
and
gabrielle
tennison
at
first
the
girl
sat
inert
with
downcast
eyes
listening
to
the
man
but
suddenly
she
raised
her
hands
in
quick
protest
again
and
apparently
became
resentful
even
angry
then
when
he
spoke
some
reassuring
words
she
became
calmer
as
i
sat
there
shrewdly
watching
i
could
not
help
reflecting
upon
a
still
further
problem
which
now
presented
itself
the
very
last
person
in
the
world
whom
i
should
have
suspected
of
being
connected
with
the
strange
affair
at
stretton
street
was
my
affable
friend
the
french
banker
i
now
began
to
wonder
if
my
first
meeting
with
him
in
the
express
train
between
york
and
king
cross
just
before
my
amazing
adventure
had
been
simply
by
chance
or
had
it
any
connection
between
that
meeting
and
the
trap
which
had
without
a
doubt
been
so
cunningly
prepared
for
me
as
i
passed
through
stretton
street
to
my
uncle
house
on
the
following
evening
the
fact
that
i
had
again
met
the
mysterious
suzor
at
the
gare
du
nord
in
paris
just
as
i
was
on
my
way
back
to
london
to
pursue
further
inquiries
was
in
itself
suspicious
i
confess
that
i
sat
utterly
bewildered
one
thing
was
plain
namely
that
he
had
no
suspicion
that
i
was
keeping
such
close
observation
upon
gabrielle
i
knew
where
she
lived
and
to
me
he
had
given
his
hotel
address
at
last
after
quite
twenty
minutes
of
serious
conversation
the
stout
servant
returned
and
after
a
few
pleasant
words
with
her
suzor
rose
and
raising
his
hat
left
them
instantly
it
occurred
to
me
that
as
i
knew
the
girl
abode
it
would
be
more
useful
perhaps
to
watch
the
movements
of
my
friend
the
french
banker
he
took
the
path
which
skirted
the
lake
and
then
cut
down
the
straight
way
which
leads
to
alexandra
gate
into
rotten
row
while
i
followed
him
far
behind
though
i
kept
him
well
in
sight
he
went
swiftly
at
a
swinging
pace
for
he
had
apparently
grown
cold
while
seated
there
in
the
north
wind
the
ground
was
hard
and
frosty
and
the
sky
grey
and
lowering
with
every
evidence
that
a
snowstorm
might
be
expected
he
walked
the
whole
length
of
rotten
row
that
leafy
way
which
is
so
animated
when
social
london
disports
itself
in
the
season
and
which
on
a
black
wintry
afternoon
when
the
smart
set
are
on
the
riviera
or
in
egypt
is
so
dull
and
deserted
at
hyde
park
corner
he
turned
along
piccadilly
until
he
hailed
a
passing
taxi
to
the
driver
of
which
he
gave
deliberate
instructions
i
glanced
around
and
very
fortunately
saw
another
disengaged
taxi
which
i
entered
giving
the
man
instructions
to
keep
the
other
in
view
with
a
promise
of
double
fare
instantly
the
man
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
enterprise
and
away
we
went
towards
the
circus
and
thence
by
way
of
oxford
street
to
the
euston
road
where
before
a
small
private
hotel
quite
close
to
the
station
suzor
descended
and
paying
the
man
entered
for
three
hours
i
waited
outside
but
he
did
not
emerge
then
i
went
to
the
carlton
and
from
the
ascertained
that
monsieur
suzor
was
staying
there
but
he
did
not
always
sleep
there
sometimes
he
would
be
absent
for
two
or
three
nights
he
went
away
into
the
country
the
smart
young
clerk
believed
hence
i
established
the
curious
fact
that
gaston
suzor
when
in
london
had
two
places
of
abode
one
in
that
hotel
and
the
other
in
the
obscurity
of
a
frowsy
house
patronized
by
visitors
to
london
what
could
be
the
motive
i
wondered
i
returned
to
the
carlton
at
midnight
and
inquired
for
monsieur
suzor
the
told
me
that
he
had
not
yet
returned
so
i
went
back
to
the
cold
cheerlessness
of
rivermead
mansions
and
slept
until
the
following
morning
at
each
turn
i
seemed
to
be
confronted
by
mystery
which
piled
upon
mystery
ever
before
my
eyes
i
saw
that
handsome
girl
lying
cold
and
lifeless
and
i
had
forged
a
certificate
in
the
name
of
a
medical
man
upon
which
her
body
had
been
reduced
to
ashes
that
i
had
acted
as
accomplice
to
some
cunning
and
deliberate
crime
i
could
not
disguise
from
myself
it
was
now
up
to
me
to
make
amends
before
god
and
man
to
strive
to
solve
the
enigma
and
to
bring
the
guilty
persons
to
justice
this
was
what
i
was
endeavouring
with
all
my
soul
to
accomplish
yet
the
point
was
whether
gabrielle
engledue
was
really
dead
or
whether
she
still
existed
in
the
person
of
gabrielle
tennison
that
was
the
first
fact
for
me
to
establish
next
morning
i
rose
early
and
gazed
across
the
cold
misty
thames
to
the
great
factories
and
wharves
upon
the
opposite
bank
the
outlook
was
indeed
dull
and
dispiriting
i
stood
recalling
how
moroni
had
walked
with
the
beautiful
girl
in
the
streets
of
florence
unwillingly
it
seemed
for
he
certainly
feared
lest
his
companion
be
recognized
i
also
recollected
the
strange
conversation
i
had
heard
with
my
own
ears
and
the
curious
attitude
which
little
cullerton
had
adopted
towards
me
even
though
she
had
revealed
to
me
the
whereabouts
of
gabrielle
tennison
my
breakfast
was
ready
soon
after
eight
and
afterwards
i
went
to
earl
court
to
watch
the
house
in
longridge
road
by
dint
of
careful
inquiries
in
the
neighbourhood
i
was
told
that
tennison
had
gone
away
a
few
days
before
to
paris
they
believed
the
young
lady
miss
tennison
appears
to
be
rather
peculiar
i
remarked
casually
to
a
woman
at
a
baker
shop
near
by
after
she
had
told
me
that
she
served
them
with
bread
yes
poor
young
lady
replied
the
woman
she
never
been
the
same
since
she
was
taken
ill
last
november
they
say
she
sustained
some
great
shock
which
so
upset
her
that
her
mind
is
now
a
little
affected
old
alford
the
servant
there
tells
me
that
the
poor
girl
will
go
a
whole
day
and
never
open
her
mouth
she
like
one
dumb
how
very
curious
i
remarked
i
wonder
what
kind
of
shock
it
was
that
caused
such
a
change
in
her
was
she
quite
all
right
before
november
perfectly
she
was
a
bright
clever
girl
and
used
often
to
come
in
here
to
me
for
chocolate
and
cakes
she
was
full
of
life
and
merriment
it
is
really
pathetic
to
see
her
as
she
is
nowadays
she
seems
to
be
brooding
over
something
but
what
it
is
nobody
can
make
out
very
remarkable
i
said
i
noticed
her
about
and
have
wondered
at
her
attitude
like
many
others
i
suppose
yes
her
mother
has
taken
her
to
a
number
of
mental
specialists
i
hear
but
nobody
seems
to
be
able
to
do
her
any
good
they
say
suffered
from
some
shock
but
they
ca
tell
exactly
what
it
is
because
the
young
lady
seems
to
have
entirely
lost
her
memory
over
a
certain
period
is
tennison
well
off
i
asked
no
the
reverse
i
should
think
the
baker
wife
replied
heard
that
tennison
was
a
very
rich
man
but
when
he
died
it
was
found
that
he
was
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
and
the
widow
was
left
very
poorly
off
it
is
curious
what
intimate
knowledge
the
little
tradespeople
glean
about
their
neighbours
even
in
london
from
the
woman
i
gathered
one
or
two
facts
of
interest
i
inquired
if
tennison
had
many
visitors
whereupon
she
replied
in
the
negative
and
added
there
used
to
be
an
italian
gentleman
who
called
very
often
a
few
weeks
ago
he
often
walked
out
with
the
young
lady
somebody
said
he
was
a
doctor
but
i
do
know
if
he
was
i
asked
the
woman
to
tell
me
what
he
was
like
when
she
gave
me
an
accurate
description
of
the
mysterious
doctor
of
the
via
cavezzo
so
moroni
had
visited
her
there
in
longridge
road
i
tried
to
ascertain
if
gaston
suzor
had
been
there
also
but
my
informant
had
no
knowledge
of
him
she
had
never
seen
him
walking
with
gabrielle
tennison
as
she
had
so
often
seen
the
italian
i
remained
for
nearly
half
an
hour
chatting
retiring
of
course
when
she
was
compelled
to
serve
customers
and
then
i
left
her
and
walked
round
to
the
house
in
longridge
road
where
i
watched
a
little
while
and
then
returned
to
the
carlton
chapter
the
eleventh
the
absolute
facts
monsieur
suzor
has
not
yet
returned
was
the
reply
of
the
smart
when
i
inquired
for
the
french
banker
but
he
is
often
away
for
two
or
three
days
i
left
the
hotel
and
taking
a
taxi
to
the
euston
road
made
a
thorough
examination
of
the
high
shabby
house
with
its
lace
curtains
a
place
which
bore
over
the
the
words
private
hotel
in
the
broad
light
of
day
it
looked
a
most
dull
uninviting
place
more
so
even
than
its
neighbours
there
are
many
such
hotels
in
the
vicinity
of
euston
station
and
this
seemed
the
most
wretched
of
them
all
for
the
windows
had
not
been
cleaned
for
many
months
while
the
steps
badly
wanted
scrubbing
after
i
had
thoroughly
examined
the
place
in
front
i
went
round
to
the
back
where
i
discovered
to
my
surprise
that
the
house
had
an
exit
at
the
rear
through
a
mews
into
a
drab
dull
street
which
ran
parallel
then
for
the
first
time
the
thought
occurred
to
me
that
on
the
previous
day
the
frenchman
might
have
entered
by
the
front
door
and
passed
out
by
the
back
into
the
next
street
i
waited
an
hour
idling
about
and
then
i
went
boldly
to
the
door
and
knocked
a
slatternly
woman
in
a
torn
and
soiled
apron
opened
the
door
slightly
we
full
up
she
snapped
before
i
could
speak
we
have
any
room
to
let
i
do
require
a
room
i
replied
politely
i
called
to
see
the
french
gentleman
you
have
staying
here
monsieur
suzor
i
thought
she
started
at
mention
of
the
name
for
she
still
held
the
door
ajar
as
though
to
prevent
me
from
peering
inside
we
got
no
french
gent
she
replied
you
made
a
mistake
but
i
saw
him
enter
here
last
night
you
must
been
mistaken
the
woman
said
might
gone
next
door
they
a
lot
of
visitors
but
you
are
full
up
eh
yes
with
our
residents
she
answered
promptly
but
from
her
nervousness
of
manner
i
knew
she
was
not
telling
the
truth
i
was
positive
that
suzor
had
entered
there
but
she
denied
all
knowledge
of
him
why
without
a
doubt
while
i
had
waited
for
him
to
emerge
he
had
passed
out
by
the
back
way
if
so
was
it
possible
that
he
had
seen
and
recognized
me
and
wished
to
escape
unseen
the
house
was
certainly
one
of
mystery
the
woman
was
palpably
perturbed
by
my
inquiry
and
she
seemed
relieved
when
i
turned
away
with
feigned
disappointment
try
next
door
she
suggested
and
disappeared
as
i
walked
along
euston
road
in
the
direction
of
tottenham
court
road
i
fell
to
wondering
whether
that
frowsy
house
was
one
of
those
which
exist
in
various
quarters
of
london
where
thieves
and
persons
hiding
from
the
police
can
find
sanctuary
and
whether
suzor
knowing
that
i
had
seen
him
had
escaped
me
by
passing
through
to
the
back
and
thus
getting
away
i
longed
to
know
the
character
of
the
serious
conversation
he
had
had
with
gabrielle
tennison
that
indeed
was
my
object
to
discover
hence
that
afternoon
i
still
pursued
my
bold
tactics
and
at
about
three
i
rang
the
bell
in
longridge
road
that
act
the
true
consequences
of
which
i
never
dreamed
eventually
brought
upon
me
a
strange
and
sensational
series
of
complications
and
adventures
so
remarkable
that
i
sometimes
think
that
it
is
only
by
a
miracle
i
am
alive
to
set
down
the
facts
in
black
and
white
the
old
alford
opened
the
door
whereupon
i
said
i
trust
you
will
excuse
me
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
am
desirous
of
a
few
minutes
private
conversation
with
you
she
looked
askance
at
me
and
naturally
i
was
a
perfect
stranger
and
servants
do
not
care
to
admit
strangers
to
the
house
when
their
mistress
is
absent
i
know
that
this
is
tennison
house
i
went
on
and
also
that
you
are
left
in
charge
of
miss
gabrielle
it
is
about
her
that
i
wish
to
consult
you
i
think
i
may
be
able
to
tell
you
something
of
interest
and
i
handed
her
my
card
alford
read
the
name
but
at
first
she
seemed
rather
disinclined
to
admit
me
indeed
not
until
i
had
further
whetted
her
curiosity
by
again
telling
her
that
i
could
give
her
some
interesting
information
did
she
show
me
upstairs
to
the
cosy
maisonnette
on
the
first
floor
it
was
a
large
house
which
had
been
divided
into
two
residences
one
the
basement
and
ground
floor
and
the
other
the
first
and
second
floors
it
was
in
the
latter
that
tennison
lived
she
ushered
me
into
a
pretty
small
but
very
tastefully
furnished
in
the
adjoining
room
someone
was
playing
a
piano
no
doubt
it
was
gabrielle
well
alford
i
began
i
have
ventured
to
call
here
because
i
have
learned
of
miss
gabrielle
unfortunate
mental
condition
and
perhaps
i
may
have
a
key
to
it
what
do
you
know
something
sir
asked
the
stout
buxom
woman
for
the
first
time
impressed
by
my
seriousness
do
you
know
anything
of
what
happened
perhaps
was
my
reply
but
first
i
wish
you
to
respect
my
confidence
i
know
you
do
that
in
the
interests
of
the
poor
young
lady
i
do
anything
in
her
interests
sir
she
replied
and
invited
me
to
take
a
seat
she
herself
remained
standing
as
a
servant
should
well
then
say
nothing
to
your
mistress
or
to
anyone
else
regarding
my
visit
first
i
want
you
to
answer
one
or
two
questions
so
as
to
either
confirm
or
negative
certain
suspicions
which
i
hold
suspicions
of
what
she
asked
i
will
reveal
those
in
due
course
i
replied
now
tell
me
what
happened
to
miss
gabrielle
that
she
should
be
in
her
present
mental
state
nobody
can
tell
sir
she
went
out
one
evening
in
november
to
go
to
her
dancing
lesson
and
was
not
seen
again
until
six
days
later
when
she
was
found
on
the
portsmouth
road
between
liphook
and
petersfield
she
had
evidently
walked
a
considerable
distance
and
was
on
her
way
towards
london
when
she
collapsed
at
the
roadside
a
carter
discovered
her
gave
warning
to
the
police
at
petersfield
and
she
was
taken
to
the
hospital
where
it
was
found
that
her
memory
had
entirely
gone
she
could
not
recognize
her
mother
or
anyone
else
on
what
date
did
she
disappear
i
asked
breathlessly
on
november
the
seventh
i
held
my
breath
it
was
on
the
day
of
my
startling
adventure
would
you
describe
to
me
the
exact
circumstances
i
asked
eagerly
i
may
be
able
to
throw
a
very
interesting
light
upon
the
affair
the
woman
hesitated
perhaps
it
was
but
natural
well
she
said
at
last
my
mistress
is
away
i
think
you
ought
to
see
her
sir
why
alford
you
are
the
trusted
servant
of
the
family
and
surely
you
know
the
whole
facts
i
do
she
answered
in
a
low
tense
voice
they
are
most
remarkable
then
tell
me
all
you
know
and
in
return
i
will
try
to
explain
some
matters
which
are
no
doubt
to
you
and
to
tennison
a
mystery
well
after
tea
on
the
day
in
question
the
seventh
of
november
miss
gabrielle
went
out
to
go
to
addison
road
to
gill
dancing
class
she
was
in
the
best
of
health
and
in
high
spirits
because
she
had
that
morning
received
an
invitation
to
go
and
stay
with
her
cousin
leonora
at
newmarket
on
the
following
wednesday
as
far
as
we
know
she
had
not
a
single
trouble
in
the
world
she
had
no
admirers
eh
yes
several
but
she
had
no
serious
flirtations
as
far
as
we
can
make
out
replied
alford
her
mother
had
gone
to
pay
a
visit
and
when
miss
gabrielle
went
out
she
told
me
that
she
would
be
home
at
nine
though
we
waited
till
midnight
she
did
not
return
we
remained
up
all
night
and
next
morning
when
i
went
to
gill
in
addison
road
i
found
that
she
had
left
there
at
six
to
return
home
we
then
went
to
kensington
police
station
and
gave
her
description
to
the
police
what
was
their
theory
i
asked
they
thought
she
had
left
home
of
her
own
accord
that
she
had
a
lover
in
secret
at
least
the
inspector
hinted
at
that
suggestion
of
course
her
mother
was
frantic
i
remarked
but
had
you
no
suspicion
of
any
person
posing
as
her
friend
none
it
was
not
till
six
days
later
about
one
in
the
day
when
a
constable
called
and
told
tennison
that
a
young
lady
answering
the
description
of
her
daughter
had
been
found
at
the
roadside
and
had
been
taken
to
the
cottage
hospital
at
petersfield
we
both
took
the
next
train
from
waterloo
and
on
arrival
at
the
hospital
found
the
poor
girl
lying
in
bed
but
so
strange
was
her
manner
that
she
was
unable
to
recognize
either
of
us
all
she
could
say
were
the
words
green
and
gold
and
she
shuddered
in
horror
as
though
the
colours
terrified
her
these
words
she
constantly
repeated
green
and
gold
green
and
gold
what
was
the
doctor
opinion
he
was
as
much
puzzled
as
we
were
sir
apparently
my
poor
young
mistress
was
found
early
in
the
morning
lying
in
the
hedge
on
the
main
portsmouth
road
her
clothes
were
wet
for
it
had
rained
during
the
night
her
boots
were
very
muddy
and
her
clothes
in
an
awful
state
she
seemed
as
if
she
had
wandered
about
for
hours
but
all
she
could
say
to
us
were
the
words
green
and
gold
did
not
she
recognize
her
mother
i
inquired
no
sir
she
has
recognized
her
even
now
doctors
have
seen
her
i
suppose
oh
yes
half
a
dozen
of
them
including
doctor
moroni
the
great
italian
doctor
he
took
her
to
florence
for
treatment
but
it
did
her
no
good
none
in
the
least
how
did
you
know
moroni
i
asked
quickly
i
think
he
became
interested
in
her
through
one
of
the
doctors
to
whom
tennison
took
her
tennison
did
not
know
moroni
before
this
affair
i
inquired
no
sir
not
to
my
knowledge
he
a
very
nice
gentleman
and
has
been
awfully
kind
to
miss
gabrielle
replied
alford
like
all
the
other
doctors
he
thinks
that
she
has
sustained
some
very
severe
shock
but
of
what
nature
nobody
can
tell
what
other
doctor
has
seen
her
i
asked
oh
well
sir
charles
wendover
in
cavendish
square
has
taken
a
great
interest
in
her
he
has
seen
her
several
times
but
seems
unable
to
restore
her
to
her
normal
state
of
mind
sir
charles
was
one
of
our
greatest
mental
specialists
i
knew
and
if
he
had
been
unable
to
do
anything
then
her
case
must
be
hopeless
but
doctor
moroni
took
her
away
to
italy
i
said
for
what
reason
he
took
her
to
professor
casuto
of
florence
i
think
that
the
name
but
he
could
do
nothing
so
she
was
brought
back
again
now
tell
me
frankly
alford
i
said
looking
the
stout
woman
full
in
the
face
have
you
ever
heard
the
name
of
de
gex
a
rich
gentleman
who
lives
in
stretton
street
just
off
park
lane
de
gex
she
repeated
her
countenance
assuming
a
blank
expression
yes
i
heard
of
him
i
read
of
him
in
the
papers
he
a
millionaire
they
say
you
have
never
heard
of
him
in
connexion
with
miss
tennison
is
she
acquainted
with
him
not
to
my
knowledge
why
do
you
ask
i
have
a
distinct
reason
for
asking
was
my
reply
remember
that
i
am
seeking
to
solve
the
enigma
of
your
young
mistress
present
extraordinary
state
of
mind
any
information
you
can
give
me
will
assist
me
towards
that
end
as
i
spoke
i
heard
a
sweet
contralto
voice
in
the
adjoining
room
break
out
into
a
song
from
one
of
the
popular
revues
it
was
voice
i
knew
all
the
information
i
possess
sir
is
at
your
disposal
the
woman
assured
me
i
only
wish
tennison
was
here
to
answer
your
questions
but
you
know
as
much
as
she
does
i
said
now
tell
me
what
is
your
theory
what
happened
to
your
young
mistress
during
the
time
she
disappeared
alford
lifted
her
hands
in
dismay
what
can
we
think
she
went
away
quite
bright
and
happy
when
she
was
found
wandering
on
the
road
between
london
and
portsmouth
her
memory
was
a
blank
she
was
haggard
worn
and
much
aged
aged
in
those
few
days
of
her
absence
she
could
remember
nothing
and
all
she
could
repeat
were
those
strange
words
green
and
gold
i
wonder
why
those
colours
were
so
impressed
upon
her
memory
i
remarked
ah
that
is
what
puzzles
the
doctors
so
each
evening
just
as
it
grows
dark
she
sits
down
and
is
silent
for
half
an
hour
with
eyes
downcast
as
though
thinking
deeply
then
she
will
suddenly
start
up
and
cry
i
see
i
see
yes
that
terrible
red
green
and
gold
oh
it
horrible
bewildering
fascinating
red
green
and
gold
the
three
colours
seem
to
obsess
her
always
at
nightfall
that
is
what
doctor
moroni
told
me
i
paused
for
a
few
moments
you
never
heard
her
speak
of
de
gex
you
quite
sure
quite
was
alford
reply
my
young
mistress
was
studying
singing
at
the
royal
academy
of
music
hark
you
hear
her
now
has
she
not
a
beautiful
voice
ah
sir
it
is
all
a
great
tragedy
it
has
broken
her
mother
heart
only
to
think
that
the
poor
girl
is
without
memory
and
her
brain
is
entirely
unbalanced
green
and
gold
is
all
that
seems
to
matter
to
her
and
whenever
she
recollects
it
and
the
words
escape
her
drawn
lips
she
seems
petrified
by
horror
what
the
woman
told
me
was
i
realized
the
actual
truth
and
yet
when
i
recollected
that
i
had
seen
the
victim
lying
dead
in
that
spacious
room
in
the
house
of
de
gex
in
stretton
street
i
became
utterly
bewildered
i
had
seen
her
dead
there
i
had
held
a
mirror
to
her
lips
and
it
had
not
become
clouded
yet
in
my
ears
there
now
sounded
the
sweet
tuneful
strains
of
that
from
joy
bells
truly
the
unfortunate
girl
possessed
a
glorious
voice
which
would
make
a
fortune
upon
the
concert
platform
or
the
stage
i
did
my
level
best
to
obtain
more
information
concerning
the
italian
doctor
and
the
man
de
gex
but
the
woman
could
tell
me
absolutely
nothing
she
was
concealing
nothing
from
me
that
i
knew
it
was
only
when
i
mentioned
the
french
banker
monsieur
suzor
that
she
started
and
became
visibly
perturbed
i
have
no
knowledge
of
the
gentleman
she
declared
yet
had
i
not
seen
them
together
in
kensington
gardens
i
do
know
whether
he
is
known
to
you
as
suzor
i
said
then
i
described
him
as
accurately
as
i
could
but
the
woman
shook
her
head
for
the
first
time
she
now
lied
to
me
with
my
own
eyes
i
had
seen
the
man
approach
her
and
the
girl
and
after
they
had
greeted
each
other
she
had
risen
and
left
the
girl
alone
with
him
curiously
enough
when
the
pair
were
alone
together
they
seemed
to
understand
each
other
i
recollected
it
all
most
vividly
to
say
the
least
it
was
strange
why
being
so
frank
upon
other
details
she
so
strenuously
denied
all
knowledge
of
the
affable
frenchman
who
had
been
my
from
york
almost
immediately
preceding
my
strange
adventures
in
the
heart
of
london
my
conversation
with
her
had
been
to
say
the
least
highly
illuminating
and
i
had
learnt
several
facts
of
which
i
had
been
in
ignorance
but
this
fixed
assertion
that
she
knew
nothing
of
the
elusive
frenchman
aroused
my
suspicions
what
was
she
hiding
from
me
i
felt
that
she
was
concealing
some
very
essential
point
one
that
might
well
prove
the
clue
to
the
whole
puzzling
enigma
and
while
we
spoke
the
girl
clear
contralto
rang
out
while
she
herself
played
the
accompaniment
at
length
i
saw
that
i
could
obtain
no
further
information
from
the
servant
therefore
i
begged
to
be
introduced
to
her
young
mistress
assuring
her
of
my
keen
interest
in
the
most
puzzling
problem
apparently
relieved
that
i
pressed
her
no
further
regarding
the
handsome
but
insidious
frenchman
the
woman
at
once
ushered
me
into
the
adjoining
room
a
small
but
one
where
at
the
grand
piano
sat
the
girl
whose
eyes
were
fixed
though
not
sightless
as
i
had
believed
when
in
florence
she
turned
them
suddenly
upon
my
companion
and
stopped
playing
ah
dear
alford
she
exclaimed
i
wondered
if
you
were
at
home
then
she
paused
she
apparently
had
no
knowledge
of
my
presence
for
she
had
not
turned
to
me
though
i
stood
straight
in
her
line
of
gaze
i
thought
you
had
gone
out
to
see
monsieur
to
tell
him
my
message
she
again
paused
and
drew
her
breath
i
stood
gazing
upon
her
beautiful
face
dark
tragic
and
full
of
mystery
she
sat
at
the
piano
her
white
fingers
inert
upon
the
keys
she
wore
a
simple
navy
blue
frock
cut
low
in
the
neck
with
a
touch
of
cream
upon
it
and
edged
with
scarlet
piping
a
dress
which
at
that
moment
was
the
mode
yet
her
pale
blank
countenance
was
indeed
pathetic
a
face
upon
which
tragedy
was
written
i
stood
for
a
moment
gazing
upon
her
perplexed
bewildered
and
breathless
in
mystery
i
spoke
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
turned
to
me
her
reply
low
and
tense
staggered
me
chapter
the
twelfth
red
green
and
gold
i
know
you
she
cried
staring
at
me
as
though
transformed
by
terror
they
told
me
you
would
come
you
are
my
enemy
you
are
here
to
kill
me
to
kill
you
miss
tennison
i
gasped
no
i
am
certainly
not
your
enemy
i
am
your
friend
she
looked
very
hard
at
me
and
i
noticed
that
her
lips
twitched
slightly
you
you
are
garfield
hugh
garfield
she
asked
her
hands
quivering
nervously
yes
that
is
my
name
i
replied
how
do
you
know
it
they
they
told
me
they
told
me
in
florence
the
doctor
pointed
you
out
he
told
me
that
you
were
my
worst
enemy
that
you
intend
to
kill
me
doctor
moroni
told
you
that
i
inquired
kindly
yes
one
day
you
were
in
the
via
tornabuoni
and
he
made
me
take
note
of
you
it
was
then
that
he
told
me
you
were
a
man
of
evil
intentions
and
warned
me
to
be
wary
of
you
i
paused
here
was
yet
another
sinister
action
on
the
part
of
moroni
besides
i
was
unaware
that
he
had
realized
i
had
watched
him
ah
yes
i
see
i
replied
in
an
attempt
to
humour
her
for
she
was
very
sweet
and
full
of
grace
and
beauty
the
doctor
tried
to
set
you
against
me
and
yet
strangely
enough
i
am
your
friend
why
should
he
seek
to
do
this
how
can
i
tell
replied
the
girl
in
a
strange
blank
voice
but
he
evidently
hates
you
he
told
me
that
you
were
also
his
enemy
as
well
as
mine
he
said
that
it
was
his
intention
to
take
steps
to
prevent
you
from
seeking
mischief
against
both
of
us
this
struck
me
as
distinctly
curious
though
the
poor
girl
mind
was
unbalanced
it
was
evident
that
she
could
recollect
some
things
while
her
memory
did
not
serve
her
in
others
of
course
it
was
quite
feasible
that
moroni
on
discovering
that
i
was
on
the
alert
would
warn
her
against
me
suddenly
hoping
to
further
stir
the
chords
of
her
memory
i
asked
have
you
seen
de
gex
lately
who
she
inquired
blankly
oswald
de
gex
who
lives
in
stretton
street
she
shook
her
head
blankly
i
afraid
i
i
do
know
him
she
replied
who
is
he
surely
you
know
stretton
street
i
asked
no
where
is
it
she
inquired
in
that
strange
inert
manner
which
characterized
her
mentality
i
did
not
pursue
the
question
further
for
it
was
evident
that
she
now
had
no
knowledge
of
the
man
in
whose
house
i
had
seen
her
lying
apparently
dead
and
if
she
were
not
dead
whose
body
was
it
that
had
been
cremated
that
was
one
of
the
main
points
of
the
problem
which
try
how
i
would
i
failed
to
grasp
would
the
enigma
ever
be
solved
as
she
stood
in
her
mother
cosy
little
gabrielle
tennison
presented
a
strangely
tragic
figure
in
the
grey
london
light
she
was
very
beautiful
it
was
true
but
upon
her
pale
countenance
was
that
terribly
vacant
look
which
was
the
index
of
her
overwrought
brain
her
memory
had
been
swept
away
by
some
unknown
horror
so
the
doctors
had
declared
and
yet
she
seemed
to
remember
distinctly
what
doctor
moroni
had
alleged
against
me
in
florence
therefore
i
questioned
her
further
concerning
the
italian
and
found
that
she
recollected
quite
a
lot
about
him
he
has
been
very
kind
to
you
has
he
not
i
asked
yes
he
is
an
exceedingly
kind
friend
he
took
me
to
see
several
doctors
in
florence
and
rome
all
of
them
said
i
had
lost
my
memory
and
she
smiled
sweetly
and
have
you
lost
your
memory
a
little
perhaps
but
not
much
here
alford
interrupted
but
you
do
recollect
what
happened
to
you
when
you
were
away
until
you
were
found
wandering
near
petersfield
tell
us
dear
no
no
not
exactly
the
girl
answered
all
i
recollect
is
that
it
was
all
red
green
and
gold
oh
such
bright
dazzling
colours
red
green
and
gold
at
first
they
were
glorious
until
until
sight
of
them
blinded
me
they
seemed
to
burn
into
my
brain
eh
and
she
drew
back
and
placed
her
right
arm
across
her
eyes
as
though
to
shut
out
from
her
gaze
something
that
appalled
her
there
they
are
she
shrieked
i
see
them
again
always
the
same
day
and
night
red
green
and
gold
red
green
and
gold
i
exchanged
glances
with
the
woman
alford
it
was
apparent
that
the
shock
the
girl
had
sustained
had
been
somehow
connected
with
the
colours
red
green
and
gold
i
tried
to
obtain
from
her
some
faint
idea
of
the
nature
of
what
she
had
witnessed
but
she
was
quite
unable
to
explain
that
she
had
fallen
victim
to
some
plot
was
evident
she
remembered
much
of
her
visit
to
florence
i
found
for
when
i
recalled
the
great
duomo
where
i
had
first
seen
her
with
moroni
she
became
quite
talkative
and
told
me
how
much
she
admired
the
magnificent
monuments
the
battistero
the
bigallo
giotto
campanile
and
the
magnificent
pictures
in
the
pitti
and
uffizi
moroni
had
apparently
also
taken
her
to
rome
presumably
to
consult
another
italian
professor
for
she
spoke
vaguely
of
the
corso
and
peter
and
described
the
forum
in
such
a
manner
that
she
must
have
visited
it
while
i
sat
chatting
with
her
it
struck
me
that
in
the
blank
state
of
her
mind
certain
things
stood
out
very
prominently
a
mental
state
well
known
to
alienists
while
others
were
entirely
blotted
out
i
referred
to
the
millionaire
who
lived
in
stretton
street
but
again
she
declared
and
with
truth
that
she
had
no
recollection
of
him
perhaps
miss
tennison
you
knew
him
under
some
other
name
i
said
and
then
proceeded
to
describe
minutely
the
handsome
rather
man
who
had
bribed
me
to
give
that
certificate
of
death
have
you
an
uncle
i
asked
presently
recollecting
that
the
man
at
stretton
street
had
declared
the
victim
to
be
his
niece
i
have
an
uncle
my
mother
brother
he
lives
in
liverpool
again
i
fell
to
wondering
whether
the
beautiful
girl
before
me
was
actually
the
same
person
whose
death
i
had
certified
to
be
due
to
heart
disease
and
who
according
to
the
official
records
had
been
cremated
she
was
very
like
and
yet
well
the
whole
affair
was
a
problem
which
each
hour
became
more
inscrutable
still
the
fact
remained
that
gabrielle
tennison
had
disappeared
suddenly
on
november
the
seventh
the
night
i
had
met
with
my
amazing
adventure
in
reply
to
my
further
questions
as
she
sat
staring
blankly
into
my
face
with
those
great
dark
eyes
of
hers
i
at
last
gathered
that
doctor
moroni
hearing
of
her
case
from
a
specialist
in
harley
street
to
whom
she
had
been
taken
by
the
had
called
upon
her
mother
and
had
had
a
long
interview
with
her
afterwards
he
had
called
daily
and
later
tennison
had
allowed
him
to
take
her
daughter
to
florence
to
consult
another
specialist
at
the
hospital
of
santa
maria
nuova
i
think
you
know
a
cullerton
i
remarked
at
last
the
effect
of
my
words
upon
her
was
almost
electrical
dolly
cullerton
she
shrieked
ah
do
mention
that
woman
name
please
do
not
mention
her
i
believed
that
she
was
a
friend
of
yours
i
said
much
surprised
friend
no
enemy
a
bitter
enemy
then
you
have
quarrelled
she
was
once
your
friend
eh
over
what
have
you
quarrelled
that
is
my
own
affair
she
snapped
in
apparent
annoyance
if
you
know
her
do
trust
her
i
warn
you
then
she
added
she
is
a
wicked
woman
and
her
husband
jack
ah
he
an
excellent
fellow
far
too
good
for
her
why
do
you
entertain
such
antipathy
toward
her
i
asked
do
tell
me
because
it
will
make
my
inquiries
so
very
much
easier
inquiries
what
inquiries
are
you
making
i
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
looking
straight
into
her
eyes
i
replied
very
seriously
i
am
making
inquiries
miss
tennison
into
what
happened
to
you
during
those
days
when
you
disappeared
i
am
seeking
to
bring
punishment
upon
those
who
are
responsible
for
your
present
condition
she
shook
her
head
mournfully
and
a
faint
smile
played
about
her
lips
but
she
did
not
reply
tell
me
more
about
cullerton
i
went
on
she
was
in
florence
when
you
were
there
in
florence
exclaimed
the
girl
as
though
amazed
what
could
she
be
doing
there
she
was
living
in
a
furnished
villa
with
her
husband
and
she
went
on
several
visits
to
de
gex
who
lives
up
at
fiesole
are
you
quite
sure
you
do
not
know
him
i
asked
he
lives
at
the
villa
clementini
have
you
ever
been
there
does
the
villa
clementini
recall
anything
to
you
she
was
thoughtful
for
a
few
moments
and
then
said
i
seem
to
have
heard
of
the
villa
but
in
what
connexion
i
do
not
recollect
you
are
certain
you
do
not
know
the
owner
of
the
villa
i
asked
again
and
described
him
once
more
very
minutely
but
alas
her
mind
seemed
a
perfect
blank
for
what
reason
had
moroni
come
to
london
and
taken
her
with
him
to
florence
but
for
the
matter
of
that
what
could
be
the
motive
of
the
whole
puzzling
affair
and
further
whose
was
the
body
that
had
been
cremated
the
points
i
had
established
all
combined
to
form
an
enigma
which
now
seemed
utterly
beyond
solution
the
pale
tragic
figure
before
me
held
me
incensed
against
those
whose
victim
she
had
been
for
it
seemed
that
for
some
distinct
reason
her
mental
balance
had
been
wantonly
destroyed
again
and
again
as
she
sat
with
her
hands
lying
idly
in
her
lap
she
stared
at
the
carpet
and
repeated
to
herself
in
a
horrified
voice
those
strange
words
red
green
and
gold
red
green
and
gold
can
not
you
recollect
about
those
colours
i
asked
her
kindly
try
and
think
about
them
where
did
you
see
them
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
turning
her
tired
eyes
upon
mine
she
replied
wearily
i
i
ca
remember
i
really
ca
remember
anything
sometimes
her
eyes
were
fixed
straight
before
her
just
as
i
had
seen
her
in
the
via
calzajoli
in
florence
when
i
had
believed
her
to
be
blind
at
such
times
her
gaze
was
vacant
and
she
seemed
to
be
entirely
oblivious
to
all
about
her
at
others
she
seemed
quite
normal
save
that
she
could
not
recall
what
had
occurred
in
those
days
when
she
was
lost
to
her
friends
days
when
i
too
had
been
missing
and
had
returned
to
my
senses
with
my
own
memory
either
distorted
or
blotted
out
could
it
be
that
the
same
drug
or
other
diabolical
method
had
been
used
upon
us
both
and
that
i
the
stronger
of
the
two
had
recovered
while
she
still
remained
in
that
half
demented
state
it
certainly
seemed
so
hence
the
more
i
reflected
the
more
intense
became
my
resolve
to
fathom
the
mystery
and
bring
those
responsible
to
justice
further
she
had
been
terrified
by
being
told
that
i
intended
to
come
there
to
kill
her
moroni
had
purposely
told
her
that
evidently
in
anticipation
that
we
might
meet
he
had
pointed
me
out
in
florence
and
warned
her
that
i
was
her
bitterest
enemy
was
it
therefore
any
wonder
that
she
would
not
tell
me
more
than
absolutely
obliged
do
you
recollect
ever
meeting
a
french
gentleman
named
monsieur
suzor
i
asked
her
presently
instantly
she
exchanged
glances
with
the
woman
alford
no
was
her
slow
reply
her
eyes
again
downcast
i
have
no
knowledge
of
any
such
man
it
was
upon
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
point
out
that
they
had
met
that
mysterious
frenchman
in
kensington
gardens
but
i
hesitated
they
certainly
were
unaware
that
i
had
watched
them
again
my
french
friend
was
a
mystery
i
did
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
our
first
meeting
had
taken
place
on
the
day
before
my
startling
adventure
in
stretton
street
and
i
began
to
wonder
whether
the
man
from
paris
had
not
followed
me
up
to
york
and
purposely
joined
the
train
in
which
i
had
travelled
back
to
london
why
did
both
the
woman
alford
and
gabrielle
tennison
deny
all
knowledge
of
the
man
whom
they
had
met
with
such
precautions
of
secrecy
and
who
when
afterwards
he
discovered
that
i
was
following
him
had
so
cleverly
evaded
me
the
man
suzor
was
evidently
implicated
in
the
plot
though
i
had
never
previously
suspected
it
twice
he
had
travelled
with
me
meeting
me
as
though
by
accident
yet
i
now
saw
that
he
had
been
my
companion
with
some
set
purpose
in
view
what
could
it
be
it
became
quite
plain
that
i
could
not
hope
to
obtain
anything
further
from
either
gabrielle
or
the
servant
therefore
i
assumed
a
polite
and
sympathetic
attitude
and
told
them
that
i
hoped
to
call
again
on
tennison
return
afterwards
i
left
feeling
that
at
least
i
had
gained
some
knowledge
even
though
it
served
to
bewilder
me
the
more
later
i
called
upon
sir
charles
wendover
in
cavendish
square
whom
i
found
to
be
a
quiet
elderly
man
of
severe
professional
aspect
and
demeanour
a
man
whose
photograph
i
had
often
seen
in
the
newspapers
for
he
was
one
of
the
of
mental
specialists
when
i
explained
that
the
object
of
my
visit
was
to
learn
something
of
the
case
of
my
friend
miss
tennison
he
asked
me
to
sit
down
and
then
switched
on
a
and
referred
to
a
big
book
upon
his
writing
table
his
consulting
room
was
dull
and
dark
with
heavy
victorian
furniture
and
a
great
bookcase
filled
with
medical
works
in
the
chair
in
which
i
sat
persons
of
all
classes
had
sat
while
he
had
examined
and
observed
them
and
afterwards
given
his
opinion
to
their
friends
ah
yes
he
exclaimed
when
at
last
he
found
the
notes
he
had
made
upon
the
case
i
saw
the
young
lady
on
the
of
november
a
most
peculiar
case
most
peculiar
leicester
and
franklyn
both
saw
her
but
they
were
just
as
much
puzzled
as
myself
and
through
his
big
round
horn
spectacles
he
continued
reading
to
himself
the
several
pages
of
notes
yes
he
remarked
at
last
i
now
recall
all
the
facts
a
very
curious
case
the
young
lady
disappeared
from
her
friends
and
was
found
some
days
later
wandering
near
petersfield
in
hampshire
in
an
exhausted
condition
she
could
not
account
for
her
disappearance
or
the
state
in
which
she
was
her
memory
had
completely
gone
and
she
has
not
i
believe
yet
recovered
it
no
she
has
not
i
said
but
the
reason
i
have
ventured
to
call
sir
charles
is
to
hear
your
opinion
on
the
case
my
opinion
he
echoed
what
opinion
can
i
hold
when
the
effect
is
so
plain
loss
of
memory
ah
but
how
could
such
a
state
of
mind
be
produced
i
asked
you
ask
me
for
the
cause
that
my
dear
sir
i
can
not
say
was
his
answer
there
are
several
causes
which
would
produce
a
similar
effect
probably
it
was
some
great
shock
but
of
what
nature
we
can
not
possibly
discover
unless
she
herself
recovers
her
normal
memory
so
far
as
to
be
able
to
assist
us
i
see
that
i
have
noted
how
she
constantly
repeats
the
words
green
and
gold
that
combination
of
colours
has
apparently
impressed
itself
upon
her
mind
to
such
an
extent
that
it
has
become
an
obsession
often
she
will
utter
no
other
words
than
those
she
was
seen
by
a
number
of
eminent
men
but
nobody
could
suggest
any
cause
other
than
shock
is
it
possible
that
some
drug
could
have
been
administered
to
her
everything
is
possible
sir
charles
answered
but
i
know
of
no
drug
which
would
produce
such
effect
in
brief
i
confess
that
i
have
no
idea
what
can
have
caused
the
sudden
mental
breakdown
i
felt
impelled
to
relate
to
him
the
whole
story
of
my
own
adventures
but
i
hesitated
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
feared
that
he
might
regard
it
as
he
most
probably
would
have
done
as
a
mere
chimera
of
my
own
imagination
a
girl
i
had
seen
dead
or
believed
i
had
seen
dead
was
now
living
and
she
was
gabrielle
tennison
of
that
i
had
no
doubt
for
the
dates
of
our
adventures
corresponded
and
yet
a
girl
also
named
gabrielle
had
died
and
her
body
had
been
cremated
the
whole
affair
seemed
to
be
beyond
human
credence
and
yet
you
my
reader
have
in
this
record
the
exact
hard
and
undeniable
facts
chapter
the
thirteenth
some
interesting
revelations
next
day
i
went
to
the
office
of
francis
and
goldsmith
and
after
a
consultation
with
both
principals
during
which
i
briefly
outlined
the
curious
circumstances
such
as
i
have
here
related
i
was
granted
further
leave
of
absence
yet
i
entertained
a
distinct
feeling
that
old
francis
somewhat
doubted
the
truth
of
my
statements
but
was
it
surprising
so
extraordinary
had
been
my
adventures
perhaps
you
do
not
credit
my
statements
gentlemen
i
said
before
leaving
their
room
but
one
day
i
hope
to
solve
the
enigma
and
you
will
then
learn
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
stories
that
any
man
has
lived
to
tell
afterwards
i
went
round
to
the
carlton
and
inquired
for
monsieur
suzor
to
my
surprise
he
was
in
therefore
i
was
ushered
up
to
his
private
where
he
greeted
me
very
warmly
so
frankly
welcome
did
he
make
me
indeed
that
i
wondered
whether
after
all
he
had
detected
me
following
him
or
whether
he
had
entered
and
escaped
from
that
house
in
the
euston
road
with
some
entirely
different
motive
ah
my
dear
friend
he
cried
in
his
excellent
english
i
wondered
what
had
become
of
you
i
called
at
rivermead
mansions
three
days
ago
but
i
could
get
no
reply
when
i
rang
at
your
flat
the
porter
said
that
both
you
and
your
friend
were
out
and
he
had
no
idea
when
you
would
return
i
go
back
to
paris
shall
you
fly
across
this
time
i
asked
no
i
go
by
train
i
have
a
lot
of
luggage
some
purchases
i
have
made
for
my
friend
the
baroness
de
henonville
it
was
then
about
five
so
he
ordered
some
tea
and
over
cigarettes
we
chatted
for
nearly
an
hour
the
longer
i
conversed
with
him
the
more
mysterious
he
appeared
why
had
he
crossed
from
paris
to
london
with
me
in
order
to
meet
clandestinely
the
poor
girl
who
was
the
rich
man
victim
that
was
one
point
which
arose
in
my
mind
but
the
main
question
was
the
reason
of
his
supposed
chance
meeting
with
me
in
the
express
between
york
and
london
during
our
chat
i
feared
to
refer
to
gabrielle
lest
he
should
suspect
that
i
knew
of
his
subtle
intrigue
i
could
see
that
he
was
congratulating
himself
upon
his
cleverness
in
misleading
me
therefore
i
chuckled
inwardly
what
i
desired
most
at
that
moment
was
to
establish
the
connexion
between
the
elegant
cosmopolitan
frenchman
and
oswald
de
gex
with
his
wily
accomplice
moroni
that
the
latter
was
a
man
of
criminal
instinct
i
had
long
ago
established
he
was
a
toady
to
a
man
of
immense
wealth
a
clever
medical
man
who
by
reason
of
his
callous
unscrupulousness
was
a
dealer
in
death
in
its
most
insidious
and
form
the
hand
of
death
is
ever
at
the
command
of
every
medical
man
hence
mankind
has
to
thank
the
medical
profession
one
of
the
and
least
recognized
in
the
world
for
its
honesty
frankness
and
strict
uprightness
in
every
profession
we
have
black
sheep
even
alas
in
the
church
but
happily
unscrupulousness
in
those
who
practise
medicine
in
great
britain
is
practically
an
unknown
quantity
but
in
europe
it
is
different
for
in
the
dossiers
held
by
the
police
of
paris
rome
madrid
and
berlin
criminals
who
practise
medicine
are
written
largely
as
witnessed
by
the
evidence
in
more
than
one
famous
trial
where
the
accused
has
been
sentenced
to
death
i
longed
to
go
to
scotland
yard
and
tell
my
story
yet
how
could
i
do
so
when
in
a
drawer
in
my
room
there
reposed
that
bundle
of
bank
of
england
notes
the
price
paid
to
me
for
being
the
accomplice
of
a
mysterious
crime
i
could
only
seek
a
solution
of
the
enigma
alone
and
unaided
by
the
authorities
i
seemed
to
be
making
a
little
headway
yet
each
fact
i
established
added
complications
to
the
amazing
affair
further
i
must
here
confess
to
you
that
during
the
past
day
or
two
i
had
found
myself
actually
in
love
with
the
beautiful
girl
whose
mentality
had
been
wilfully
destroyed
by
some
means
which
medical
science
failed
to
establish
from
the
first
i
had
been
filled
with
great
admiration
for
her
she
was
indeed
very
beautiful
with
wonderful
eyes
and
a
perfect
complexion
there
was
grace
in
every
movement
save
when
at
times
she
held
herself
rigid
with
fixed
blank
eyes
as
though
fascinated
or
gripped
by
some
invisible
power
more
than
once
i
had
wondered
whether
she
were
under
hypnotic
influence
but
that
theory
had
been
completely
negatived
by
sir
charles
wendover
be
that
as
it
may
i
had
now
fallen
desperately
in
love
with
the
girl
whom
i
was
seeking
to
rescue
from
her
enemies
why
had
the
body
of
gabrielle
engledue
been
cremated
if
not
to
destroy
all
evidence
of
a
crime
gabrielle
tennison
still
lived
therefore
another
woman
must
have
lost
her
life
by
foul
means
most
probably
by
poison
in
face
of
the
pains
that
were
taken
by
moroni
to
efface
all
trace
of
the
cause
of
death
over
our
tea
the
affable
french
banker
told
me
of
a
rapid
journey
to
liverpool
which
he
had
taken
a
few
days
before
he
having
some
pressing
business
with
a
man
who
was
on
the
point
of
sailing
for
new
york
the
person
in
question
had
absconded
from
paris
owing
the
bank
a
large
sum
of
money
and
he
had
that
day
cabled
to
the
new
york
police
asking
for
his
arrest
on
landing
i
shall
probably
be
compelled
to
go
across
to
america
and
apply
for
him
to
be
sent
back
to
paris
my
friend
said
so
i
am
going
back
for
instructions
as
he
spoke
i
pondered
was
it
possible
that
he
was
unaware
of
the
surveillance
i
had
kept
upon
him
during
and
after
his
secret
interview
with
gabrielle
if
so
why
had
he
entered
that
dingy
house
in
the
euston
road
and
made
his
exit
by
the
back
way
i
had
established
the
fact
that
the
house
was
to
thieves
of
a
certain
class
who
used
it
in
order
to
escape
being
followed
several
such
houses
exist
in
london
one
is
near
the
elephant
and
castle
another
in
the
clapham
road
while
there
is
one
in
hammersmith
road
and
still
another
just
off
clarence
terrace
at
regent
park
such
houses
serve
as
sanctuaries
for
those
escaping
from
justice
the
latter
know
them
and
as
they
slip
through
they
pay
a
toll
that
the
keeper
of
the
house
will
deny
that
they
have
ever
been
there
the
houses
of
london
and
their
keepers
always
sly
crooks
form
a
particular
study
in
themselves
one
pretends
to
be
a
garage
another
a
private
hotel
a
third
a
small
greengrocer
and
a
fourth
a
boot
repairer
all
those
trades
are
carried
on
as
blinds
the
public
believe
them
to
be
honest
businesses
but
there
is
far
more
business
done
in
concealing
those
wanted
by
the
police
than
in
anything
else
from
suzor
demeanour
i
felt
that
he
did
not
suspect
me
of
having
been
witness
of
his
entry
into
that
frowsy
house
near
euston
station
but
why
had
he
gone
there
he
must
have
feared
that
he
might
be
watched
and
why
the
only
answer
to
that
question
was
that
he
had
met
gabrielle
clandestinely
and
feared
lest
afterwards
he
might
be
followed
but
why
should
he
fear
if
not
implicated
in
the
plot
to
me
it
now
seemed
plain
that
i
had
been
marked
down
as
a
pawn
in
the
game
prior
to
that
day
when
we
travelled
together
from
york
to
london
i
had
not
altogether
recovered
from
the
effect
of
what
had
been
administered
to
me
often
i
felt
a
curious
sensation
of
dizziness
and
of
overwhelming
depression
which
i
knew
was
the
after
effects
of
that
loss
of
all
sense
of
my
surroundings
when
i
had
been
taken
to
the
hospital
in
malo
i
had
been
found
at
the
roadside
in
france
just
as
gabrielle
had
been
found
on
the
highway
near
petersfield
when
i
reflected
my
blood
boiled
the
affable
and
highly
cultured
frenchman
presented
a
further
enigma
he
was
crossing
back
to
paris
next
day
what
if
i
too
went
back
to
paris
and
watched
his
further
movements
as
i
sat
chatting
and
laughing
with
him
i
decided
upon
this
course
when
shortly
afterwards
i
left
i
went
straight
across
hammersmith
bridge
and
found
that
harry
hambledon
had
just
returned
from
his
office
we
sat
together
at
table
whereupon
i
told
him
one
or
two
facts
i
had
discovered
and
urged
him
to
cross
to
paris
with
me
next
day
you
see
you
can
watch
for
you
will
be
a
perfect
stranger
to
suzor
i
will
bear
the
expense
i
still
got
a
little
money
in
the
bank
we
can
see
suzor
off
from
charing
cross
then
take
a
taxi
to
croydon
fly
over
and
be
in
paris
hours
before
he
arrives
at
the
gare
du
nord
there
you
will
wait
for
his
arrival
follow
him
and
see
his
destination
hambledon
who
was
already
much
interested
in
my
strange
adventures
quickly
saw
the
point
i
got
one
or
two
rather
urgent
things
on
he
replied
but
if
you
really
wish
me
to
go
with
you
i
can
telephone
to
my
friend
hardy
and
ask
him
to
look
after
them
for
me
we
sha
be
away
very
long
i
suppose
a
week
at
the
most
i
said
i
want
to
establish
the
true
identity
of
this
banker
friend
of
mine
i
have
a
distinct
suspicion
of
him
and
so
have
i
hambledon
said
depend
upon
it
some
big
conspiracy
has
been
afoot
and
they
are
now
endeavouring
to
cover
up
all
traces
of
their
villainy
i
was
discussing
it
with
norah
when
we
were
walking
in
richmond
park
last
night
i
quite
agree
i
replied
then
we
fly
across
to
paris
at
and
keep
watch
upon
this
man
who
meets
miss
tennison
in
secret
and
then
uses
a
thieves
sanctuary
in
order
to
escape
that
story
of
the
absconding
customer
of
the
bank
is
a
fiction
i
believe
harry
exclaimed
i
certain
it
is
i
said
then
why
should
he
have
told
it
to
you
if
he
did
not
suspect
that
you
had
been
watching
my
friend
queried
i
had
not
considered
that
point
it
was
certainly
strange
to
say
the
least
that
he
should
thus
have
endeavoured
to
mislead
me
next
morning
hambledon
was
up
early
and
went
to
charing
cross
where
he
watched
the
banker
departure
afterwards
he
returned
and
with
our
we
travelled
down
to
the
london
terminal
aerodrome
at
croydon
where
just
before
noon
we
entered
one
of
the
large
passenger
aeroplanes
which
fly
between
london
and
paris
within
half
an
hour
of
our
arrival
at
the
aerodrome
we
were
already
in
the
air
sailing
gaily
southward
towards
lympne
near
folkestone
where
we
had
to
report
previous
to
crossing
the
channel
the
morning
was
bright
and
although
cold
the
visibility
was
excellent
below
us
spread
a
wide
panorama
of
tiny
square
fields
and
small
clusters
of
houses
that
were
villages
and
larger
ones
with
straight
roads
running
like
ribbons
through
them
which
were
towns
the
dark
patches
dotting
the
ground
beneath
us
were
woods
and
coppices
while
running
straight
beneath
was
a
tiny
train
upon
the
railway
between
folkestone
and
london
there
were
three
other
passengers
beside
ourselves
apparently
french
business
men
who
were
all
excitement
it
evidently
being
their
first
flight
very
soon
we
could
see
the
sea
and
presently
we
could
also
discern
the
french
coast
as
we
approached
lympne
the
observer
telephoned
by
wireless
back
to
croydon
telling
them
of
our
position
and
in
a
few
moments
we
were
high
over
the
channel
at
marquise
on
the
other
side
we
again
reported
and
then
following
the
railway
line
we
sped
towards
paris
long
before
the
express
by
which
the
banker
was
travelling
had
left
calais
indeed
shortly
before
three
we
had
installed
ourselves
at
the
hôtel
terminus
at
the
gare
lazare
in
paris
and
afterwards
took
a
stroll
along
the
boulevards
awaiting
the
time
when
the
express
from
calais
was
due
at
the
gare
du
nord
shortly
before
five
hambledon
left
me
and
took
a
taxi
to
the
station
for
the
purpose
of
watching
suzor
arrival
and
ascertaining
his
destination
which
of
course
i
feared
to
do
lest
he
should
recognize
me
it
was
not
until
past
nine
that
evening
that
my
friend
returned
to
the
hotel
he
described
how
suzor
on
arrival
at
the
gare
du
nord
had
been
met
by
a
young
english
lady
and
the
pair
had
driven
straight
to
the
rotonde
restaurant
at
the
corner
of
the
boulevard
haussmann
where
they
had
dined
together
i
dined
near
them
and
one
could
see
plainly
that
their
conversation
was
a
very
earnest
one
declared
my
companion
she
seemed
to
be
relating
something
and
apparently
was
most
apprehensive
while
he
on
his
part
seemed
gravely
perplexed
though
he
ordered
an
expensive
meal
they
scarcely
touched
it
they
sat
in
a
corner
and
spoke
in
english
but
i
could
not
catch
a
single
word
in
response
to
my
request
he
described
suzor
lady
friend
then
he
added
she
wore
only
one
ornament
a
beautiful
piece
of
jade
suspended
round
her
neck
by
a
narrow
black
ribbon
when
they
rose
and
the
waiter
brought
their
coats
i
heard
him
call
her
dorothy
dorothy
cullerton
i
gasped
i
recollect
that
piece
of
chinese
jade
she
wore
in
florence
what
is
she
doing
here
meeting
that
man
clandestinely
the
man
slipped
something
into
her
hand
beneath
the
table
and
she
put
it
into
her
handbag
hambledon
said
i
have
a
suspicion
that
it
was
a
small
roll
of
french
bank
notes
payment
for
some
information
perhaps
i
said
i
do
trust
that
young
stockbroker
wife
well
i
asked
and
what
then
on
leaving
the
rotonde
they
drove
to
the
rue
de
rivoli
where
the
lady
alighted
and
entered
the
hôtel
wagram
while
he
went
along
to
the
hôtel
du
louvre
was
his
reply
i
was
much
puzzled
at
the
secret
meeting
between
the
affable
frenchman
and
young
cullerton
and
next
day
by
watching
the
entrance
to
the
hôtel
wagram
which
was
an
easy
matter
in
the
bustle
of
the
rue
de
rivoli
i
satisfied
myself
that
my
surmise
was
correct
for
at
eleven
she
came
forth
entered
a
taxi
and
drove
away
my
next
inquiry
was
at
the
head
office
of
the
crédit
lyonnais
in
the
boulevard
des
italiens
but
as
i
suspected
the
name
of
my
french
was
unknown
we
have
no
official
of
the
name
of
suzor
replied
the
polite
assistant
director
whom
i
had
asked
to
see
the
gentleman
must
be
pretending
to
be
associated
with
us
monsieur
it
is
not
the
first
time
we
have
heard
of
such
a
thing
so
it
was
apparent
that
suzor
was
not
a
bank
official
after
all
in
the
meantime
hambledon
was
keeping
watch
at
the
hôtel
du
louvre
and
it
was
not
until
afternoon
that
he
rejoined
me
to
report
what
had
occurred
it
seemed
that
suzor
had
just
before
noon
strolled
to
the
grand
café
where
he
had
met
a
man
who
was
awaiting
him
they
took
coffee
together
and
then
entering
a
taxi
drove
out
to
the
bois
where
at
the
pré
catelan
they
were
joined
by
a
smartly
dressed
young
woman
who
was
no
doubt
an
actress
the
three
sat
talking
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
which
the
two
men
left
her
and
returned
to
a
small
restaurant
in
the
boulevard
martin
where
they
took
their
afterwards
suzor
had
returned
to
his
hotel
at
my
suggestion
my
companion
had
become
on
friendly
terms
with
the
under
concierge
who
had
promised
to
inform
him
if
monsieur
suzor
should
chance
to
be
leaving
it
was
well
that
he
had
arranged
this
for
when
at
six
hambledon
again
went
to
the
hotel
the
man
in
uniform
told
him
that
monsieur
suzor
was
leaving
the
quai
at
eleven
that
night
by
the
through
express
for
madrid
i
saw
that
for
me
to
travel
to
spain
by
the
same
train
as
the
man
who
had
posed
as
a
banker
would
be
to
court
exposure
hence
hambledon
volunteered
to
travel
to
the
spanish
capital
in
all
secrecy
while
i
promised
to
join
him
as
soon
as
he
sent
me
his
address
that
journey
was
destined
to
be
an
adventurous
one
indeed
as
i
will
duly
explain
to
you
but
its
results
proved
more
startling
and
astounding
than
we
ever
anticipated
chapter
the
fourteenth
the
gate
of
the
sun
the
spring
morning
was
grey
and
rather
threatening
as
i
left
the
hôtel
de
la
paix
in
madrid
and
walked
from
the
puerta
del
sol
past
the
smart
shops
in
the
carrera
de
san
jeronimo
and
across
the
broad
handsome
plaza
de
canovas
in
order
to
meet
hambledon
at
a
point
which
he
had
indicated
in
the
retiro
park
late
on
the
previous
night
i
had
arrived
in
the
spanish
capital
and
while
hambledon
was
at
the
palace
hotel
in
the
plaza
de
canovas
i
had
gone
to
the
paix
in
the
puerta
del
sol
i
had
been
in
madrid
only
once
before
in
my
life
and
as
i
walked
through
the
gay
thoroughfares
i
recalled
that
proud
saying
of
the
madrileños
de
madrid
al
cielo
y
en
el
cielo
un
ventanillo
para
ver
á
madrid
from
madrid
to
heaven
and
in
heaven
a
loophole
to
look
at
madrid
the
spanish
capital
is
indeed
a
very
fine
city
full
of
life
of
movement
and
of
prosperity
crossing
the
prado
where
the
trees
were
already
in
full
leaf
i
took
that
straight
broad
way
which
led
past
the
royal
academy
and
again
crossing
the
calle
de
alfonso
xii
came
to
the
alcahofa
fountain
the
fountain
of
the
artichoke
near
which
i
waited
for
the
coming
of
my
friend
i
stood
there
upon
ground
that
was
historic
and
as
i
gazed
around
upon
that
sylvan
scene
i
wondered
what
would
be
the
result
of
our
long
journey
from
rivermead
mansions
that
beautiful
park
which
in
the
seventeenth
century
had
been
laid
out
with
such
taste
by
the
de
olivares
the
favourite
of
philip
iv
had
been
the
scene
of
innumerable
festivals
which
swallowed
millions
of
money
and
gave
rise
to
many
biting
pasquinas
and
coplas
it
is
the
hyde
park
of
spanish
society
there
all
the
latest
paris
fashions
are
seen
at
the
hour
of
the
promenade
and
everybody
who
is
anybody
in
spain
must
be
seen
walking
or
riding
along
its
picturesque
paths
i
had
not
long
to
wait
for
hambledon
for
after
a
few
moments
his
familiar
sturdy
figure
came
into
sight
well
hughie
he
exclaimed
as
we
sank
upon
a
seat
together
there
some
deep
game
being
played
here
i
certain
what
game
i
asked
quickly
ah
i
ca
yet
make
it
out
he
replied
but
i
tell
you
occurred
suzor
on
arrival
went
to
the
ritz
where
he
has
a
private
suite
and
after
i
had
watched
him
safely
there
i
took
up
my
quarters
at
the
palace
on
the
other
side
of
the
square
and
started
to
keep
a
watch
upon
our
friend
i
got
the
concierge
at
the
ritz
to
do
something
for
me
for
which
i
paid
him
generously
so
as
to
pave
the
way
for
information
concerning
suzor
in
case
we
may
want
it
good
i
said
there
nothing
like
making
friends
with
a
concierge
he
knows
everything
about
the
visitors
to
his
hotel
and
about
their
friends
also
well
on
the
first
day
suzor
did
not
go
out
at
all
but
on
the
second
morning
at
about
eleven
he
came
forth
very
smartly
dressed
and
strolling
along
the
calle
de
alcalá
turned
into
the
gran
café
where
an
elderly
lady
dressed
in
black
was
awaiting
him
she
was
spanish
without
a
doubt
he
greeted
her
with
studied
courtesy
and
then
sat
down
opposite
her
at
the
little
table
and
ordered
they
conversed
together
in
low
earnest
tones
she
seemed
to
be
questioning
him
while
he
gave
rather
hesitating
replies
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
had
come
to
madrid
in
order
to
meet
her
therefore
when
after
about
half
an
hour
they
parted
i
followed
the
lady
she
took
a
cab
and
drove
to
the
north
station
where
she
took
a
ticket
for
segovia
which
i
found
was
about
sixty
miles
from
here
i
of
course
entered
another
compartment
of
the
train
and
in
about
three
hours
we
reached
our
destination
at
the
station
she
was
met
by
a
handsome
young
girl
who
began
to
ply
her
with
questions
to
which
the
elder
woman
replied
in
monosyllables
as
the
pair
ascended
the
pretty
boulevard
that
led
into
the
picturesque
town
perched
as
it
is
upon
a
rock
between
two
streams
up
the
passeo
just
prior
to
entering
the
ancient
city
so
full
of
antiquities
the
two
ladies
went
in
the
gates
of
a
large
white
house
evidently
the
residence
of
someone
of
importance
unseen
i
watched
the
door
as
it
was
opened
by
a
who
bowed
to
them
as
he
admitted
them
afterwards
i
passed
into
that
most
venerable
city
of
castile
where
i
found
a
hotel
called
the
europeo
where
i
ordered
a
meal
the
waiter
spoke
broken
english
and
when
i
described
the
big
white
house
in
the
passeo
ezequiel
gonzález
and
inquired
who
lived
there
he
replied
that
it
was
the
condesa
de
chamartin
with
her
niece
señorita
carmen
florez
the
countess
was
the
widow
of
an
immensely
wealthy
spaniard
who
had
died
leaving
most
of
his
money
away
from
his
wife
there
were
rumours
afloat
both
in
segovia
and
in
madrid
where
he
had
had
a
fine
house
that
the
widow
was
now
in
quite
poor
circumstances
yet
the
conde
de
chamartin
had
been
one
of
the
richest
men
in
spain
then
i
came
back
and
telegraphed
to
you
in
paris
what
has
suzor
done
since
practically
nothing
he
hardly
ever
goes
out
in
the
daytime
which
shows
me
that
he
is
no
stranger
in
madrid
yet
almost
every
evening
after
dinner
he
goes
alone
to
one
or
other
of
the
theatres
or
to
the
variety
show
at
the
trianon
last
night
he
was
at
at
the
teatro
real
alone
always
alone
then
why
has
he
come
here
to
madrid
i
queried
in
order
to
meet
the
condesa
de
chamartin
but
he
has
already
met
her
she
came
from
segovia
to
keep
that
appointment
hence
one
would
think
he
would
have
returned
to
paris
by
this
time
we
can
only
watch
hambledon
replied
i
will
continue
my
surveillance
but
you
had
better
be
seen
about
as
little
as
possible
he
might
meet
and
recognize
you
should
i
discover
anything
or
should
i
want
to
see
you
i
will
either
telephone
to
you
at
your
hotel
or
we
will
meet
again
at
this
spot
thus
it
was
arranged
and
half
an
hour
later
we
parted
i
walked
back
to
my
hotel
my
thoughts
occupied
by
the
beautiful
girl
who
had
suddenly
so
possessed
me
before
me
by
day
and
by
night
rose
visions
of
the
lovely
countenance
of
that
strange
expression
which
was
so
pathetic
and
so
mysterious
i
recollected
her
sweet
smiles
when
we
had
talked
in
her
mother
in
longridge
road
and
i
knew
that
my
admiration
had
already
ripened
into
love
but
it
was
all
so
mysterious
so
incredible
indeed
that
i
hardly
dared
reflect
upon
those
amazing
events
of
the
immediate
past
the
name
of
the
great
financier
de
gex
was
one
to
conjure
with
all
over
europe
since
my
night
adventure
in
stretton
street
i
had
learnt
much
concerning
him
his
nationality
was
obscure
he
posed
as
an
englishman
but
at
the
same
time
he
was
a
frenchman
an
italian
and
a
greek
his
financial
tentacles
were
spread
throughout
europe
fabulously
wealthy
he
held
a
controlling
interest
in
a
number
of
banks
and
great
industrial
concerns
and
it
was
said
that
he
knew
the
capitals
of
the
world
as
a
milkman
knows
the
streets
of
his
particular
suburb
behind
the
of
great
events
his
intriguing
figure
followed
unseen
unheralded
influencing
dynasties
through
his
secretaries
and
agents
one
of
whom
was
prime
minister
of
a
foreign
kingdom
and
financing
bankrupt
states
now
and
then
he
emerged
from
the
retirement
of
the
villa
clementini
and
would
go
to
paris
brussels
or
rome
and
there
entertain
most
lavishly
ministers
and
aristocrats
of
various
nations
and
frequently
give
them
presents
at
the
one
man
declared
to
me
that
oswald
de
gex
was
the
friend
of
mighty
persons
and
the
moulder
of
mighty
events
he
was
a
man
of
mystery
who
quietly
and
in
secret
juggled
the
destinies
of
nations
in
his
gilded
fingers
wherever
money
has
the
power
to
speak
there
oswald
de
gex
would
be
found
smiling
an
inscrutable
mysterious
smile
but
always
the
centre
of
intrigue
and
adventure
to
outwit
and
expose
such
a
man
i
was
determined
back
in
the
hotel
i
stood
at
the
window
of
my
room
gazing
out
across
the
busy
plaza
upon
the
fine
ministerio
de
la
gobernacion
with
its
great
clock
upon
the
façade
the
gateway
of
the
rising
sun
is
ever
a
scene
of
animation
and
the
more
so
on
a
fiesta
which
it
happened
to
be
that
day
i
stood
there
looking
blankly
out
upon
the
centre
of
madrid
life
it
was
irksome
to
be
compelled
to
remain
in
the
hotel
during
the
daytime
for
fear
of
recognition
by
the
man
suzor
why
had
he
held
that
secret
meeting
with
the
widow
of
the
wealthy
count
chamartin
hambledon
had
certainly
acted
with
discretion
and
promptitude
in
following
the
lady
in
black
to
her
home
in
segovia
could
the
frenchman
visit
to
madrid
be
in
any
way
connected
with
the
affair
at
stretton
street
a
new
and
highly
interesting
feature
had
arisen
in
the
fact
which
i
had
only
recently
discovered
that
suzor
had
apparently
travelled
with
me
from
york
to
london
on
that
afternoon
with
some
set
and
distinct
purpose
he
had
been
most
affable
and
he
had
told
me
all
about
himself
a
story
which
i
now
knew
to
be
fictitious
in
return
i
suppose
i
had
told
him
something
about
myself
but
the
exact
conversation
had
long
ago
escaped
my
memory
i
had
had
no
suspicion
that
the
man
who
had
posed
as
an
important
official
of
one
of
the
best
known
of
french
banking
corporations
was
in
any
way
associated
with
the
mysterious
oswald
de
gex
until
i
had
seen
him
meet
in
secret
the
girl
with
whom
i
had
fallen
so
violently
in
love
i
tried
to
analyse
my
feelings
towards
gabrielle
tennison
but
failed
utterly
i
loved
her
and
loving
her
so
well
i
now
set
my
whole
soul
upon
elucidating
the
mystery
truly
the
problem
was
most
puzzling
presenting
further
complications
at
every
turn
through
the
day
i
idled
about
the
big
hotel
occupying
my
time
in
writing
letters
and
reading
the
papers
the
café
below
in
the
late
afternoon
was
crowded
for
on
the
day
of
a
fiesta
madrid
is
always
agog
with
life
and
movement
when
night
fell
and
i
ate
my
solitary
dinner
in
the
big
restaurant
where
i
specially
ordered
an
with
a
dish
so
dear
to
the
spanish
palate
and
which
can
not
be
procured
beyond
the
confines
of
king
alfonso
kingdom
the
waiter
aided
me
of
course
and
he
smiled
contentedly
when
i
gave
him
his
around
me
there
dined
as
smart
a
set
of
people
as
those
who
frequented
the
carlton
in
london
and
perhaps
the
toilettes
were
even
more
elaborate
in
certain
feminine
details
the
west
end
can
be
eclipsed
both
by
modern
madrid
and
bucharest
while
paris
remains
where
she
has
ever
been
the
inventor
of
feminine
fashion
and
the
alluring
city
of
light
in
madrid
one
has
all
the
prosperity
combined
with
extravagance
the
latest
of
the
rue
de
la
paix
is
seen
at
the
ritz
in
madrid
almost
before
it
is
seen
at
armenonville
and
it
becomes
only
when
it
has
filtered
through
dover
street
or
petticoat
lane
as
that
thoroughfare
is
termed
by
truculent
london
bachelors
after
dinner
i
spent
an
hour
at
the
gay
café
iberia
in
the
carrera
de
san
jeronimo
and
returned
early
to
the
hotel
as
i
entered
the
concierge
met
me
with
a
note
it
was
from
harry
hambledon
written
an
hour
before
urging
me
to
meet
him
at
the
gato
negro
café
the
black
cat
in
the
calle
del
principe
i
lost
no
time
in
keeping
the
appointment
and
on
meeting
my
friend
he
whispered
excitedly
suzor
has
a
visitor
he
arrived
at
the
ritz
at
six
and
they
have
dined
together
he
is
a
man
of
between
forty
and
fifty
rather
and
has
given
his
name
at
the
hotel
as
henri
thibon
rentier
of
bordeaux
aged
nearly
fifty
sallow
i
echoed
are
his
features
of
a
rather
oriental
cast
a
dark
handsome
man
with
eyes
and
a
dimple
in
the
centre
of
his
chin
i
asked
eagerly
yes
that
just
describes
him
de
gex
i
gasped
then
he
is
here
after
dinner
they
went
out
to
the
trianon
they
are
there
now
then
we
will
watch
them
return
to
the
ritz
i
said
we
spent
an
hour
together
in
the
café
after
which
we
rose
and
walked
through
the
streets
and
along
beneath
the
trees
of
the
prado
until
we
came
to
the
great
plaza
where
opposite
the
neptune
fountain
the
fine
hotel
stands
back
behind
its
gardens
we
both
halted
against
the
colossal
fountain
the
waters
of
which
were
plashing
into
the
great
basin
and
found
that
from
where
we
were
standing
we
had
a
good
view
of
the
entrance
to
the
hotel
that
the
theatres
were
over
was
proved
by
the
number
of
cars
and
taxis
that
were
depositing
people
in
who
had
come
to
the
ritz
to
supper
hence
we
had
not
long
to
wait
before
we
distinguished
suzor
and
his
companion
both
in
strolling
on
foot
across
the
plaza
from
the
calle
de
cervantes
in
the
direction
of
the
hotel
in
an
instant
i
recognized
the
form
of
the
mysterious
owner
of
the
house
in
stretton
street
yes
i
cried
i
not
mistaken
but
why
is
he
here
under
the
name
of
thibon
without
a
doubt
he
is
known
in
madrid
why
should
he
seek
to
conceal
his
identity
we
are
here
to
discover
the
motive
of
his
journey
from
italy
according
to
his
passport
he
arrived
from
irun
but
if
he
had
come
direct
from
italy
he
would
have
come
from
the
south
from
barcelona
most
probably
he
has
a
house
in
paris
no
doubt
he
has
followed
his
friend
suzor
from
there
it
will
be
interesting
to
watch
as
i
spoke
the
pair
passed
up
the
steps
of
the
hotel
and
were
lost
to
sight
therefore
we
turned
and
retraced
our
steps
along
the
wide
carrera
de
san
jeronimo
to
my
hotel
where
for
an
hour
hambledon
sat
in
my
room
discussing
the
situation
he
suggested
that
he
should
move
from
the
palace
hotel
to
the
ritz
which
was
only
just
opposite
at
first
it
seemed
a
good
idea
but
on
reflection
i
did
not
agree
because
i
feared
lest
he
might
be
recognized
by
suzor
de
gex
of
course
would
not
know
him
but
with
suzor
the
danger
of
recognition
was
always
great
if
either
realized
that
they
were
being
watched
all
chances
of
solving
the
problem
would
instantly
disappear
only
by
secret
and
patient
watchfulness
could
we
discover
the
motive
of
that
amazing
affair
near
park
lane
and
again
the
truth
of
what
actually
occurred
on
that
fateful
november
night
there
is
no
doubt
some
further
devil
game
is
in
progress
here
i
declared
as
harry
sat
upon
my
bed
smoking
a
cigarette
while
i
was
stretched
in
an
and
it
is
up
to
us
to
discover
what
it
is
and
whether
it
has
any
bearing
upon
the
plot
against
poor
gabrielle
tennison
yes
agreed
hambledon
we
must
watch
all
their
actions
for
it
is
now
evident
that
this
fellow
suzor
is
deeply
implicated
in
the
conspiracy
whatever
its
nature
chapter
the
fifteenth
the
intruder
during
the
next
few
days
i
remained
idle
in
the
hotel
not
daring
to
go
out
while
it
was
light
and
leaving
the
surveillance
upon
de
gex
and
his
friend
to
my
old
friend
hambledon
each
night
we
met
at
one
café
or
another
as
we
appointed
when
he
would
report
to
me
what
he
had
witnessed
during
the
day
it
seemed
that
de
gex
or
monsieur
thibon
as
he
preferred
to
call
himself
shared
suzor
private
and
curiously
enough
he
also
did
not
go
out
in
the
daytime
after
all
that
was
not
surprising
for
such
a
great
figure
in
international
finance
was
probably
in
the
spanish
capital
i
had
learnt
that
he
had
had
a
hand
in
the
finances
of
spain
and
had
made
some
huge
profits
thereby
this
man
of
mystery
and
intrigue
was
i
felt
there
in
madrid
with
some
malice
aforethought
the
very
fact
that
he
feared
to
be
recognized
was
in
itself
sufficient
proof
on
the
other
hand
suzor
now
went
out
in
the
daytime
going
hither
and
thither
as
though
transacting
business
for
his
friend
hambledon
had
reported
to
me
how
he
had
sent
three
cipher
telegrams
by
wireless
from
the
correo
central
in
the
calle
carretas
the
first
was
to
london
the
second
on
the
following
noon
to
an
address
in
paris
and
the
third
at
one
in
the
morning
to
moroni
in
florence
the
message
to
the
latter
was
in
figures
groups
of
five
numerals
as
used
by
the
british
admiralty
besides
he
had
also
posted
several
letters
in
that
big
box
at
the
chief
marked
extranjero
the
message
to
moroni
was
highly
suspicious
harry
hambledon
as
a
solicitor
was
of
course
a
very
acute
person
and
in
addition
he
had
very
fortunately
entered
into
the
true
spirit
of
the
adventure
though
he
longed
to
be
back
again
at
richmond
with
his
pretty
norah
peyton
yet
the
mystery
of
the
whole
affair
had
bewildered
him
and
he
was
as
keen
as
i
was
myself
in
elucidating
the
strange
enigma
moroni
was
no
doubt
a
tool
in
the
hands
of
that
quiet
man
who
by
reason
of
his
colossal
wealth
and
huge
financial
resources
could
even
make
and
unmake
dynasties
oswald
de
gex
the
man
who
without
nationality
or
patriotism
pulled
a
hundred
financial
strings
both
in
europe
and
in
america
held
the
sinister
doctor
moroni
in
his
pay
i
could
discern
that
fact
just
as
i
could
see
that
the
man
suzor
who
had
so
cleverly
posed
as
an
official
of
the
crédit
lyonnais
was
one
of
the
many
confidential
agents
of
the
mysterious
de
gex
one
evening
i
went
by
appointment
to
the
nuevo
club
to
which
i
had
been
admitted
as
a
foreign
member
and
in
the
i
awaited
hambledon
at
last
he
came
through
the
big
swing
doors
and
approaching
me
excitedly
exclaimed
they
both
gone
out
to
segovia
to
see
the
countess
de
chamartin
de
gex
sent
a
wire
early
this
morning
and
then
on
receipt
of
a
reply
they
hired
a
car
and
drove
out
to
keep
the
appointment
chamartin
was
a
spanish
financier
de
gex
is
one
of
international
fame
a
millionaire
i
remarked
the
wits
of
de
gex
are
perhaps
pitted
against
the
widow
and
the
executors
of
the
dead
man
do
you
agree
entirely
was
hambledon
reply
i
follow
the
trend
of
your
thoughts
hugh
de
gex
is
the
controlling
influence
of
great
events
but
why
should
he
seek
to
send
you
into
an
asylum
for
the
insane
with
the
same
motive
that
he
endeavoured
to
send
into
such
an
asylum
poor
gabrielle
tennison
i
said
bitterly
in
law
we
have
an
old
adage
which
says
the
motive
and
you
also
discover
the
miscreant
harry
remarked
i
agreed
and
as
much
bewildered
as
he
exclaimed
well
as
far
as
we
can
discern
there
is
something
very
underhand
in
this
meeting
but
the
count
widow
is
a
cheery
person
despite
her
mournful
black
and
perhaps
after
all
we
may
be
upon
a
wrong
scent
exactly
de
gex
may
be
attracted
by
her
handsome
niece
the
señorita
carmen
florez
eh
he
may
but
as
the
dead
count
was
a
great
financier
oswald
de
gex
may
be
working
in
the
interests
of
the
widow
or
to
the
contrary
to
the
contrary
said
my
friend
without
hesitation
next
morning
hambledon
told
me
that
de
gex
and
suzor
did
not
return
to
the
ritz
until
nearly
one
apparently
they
had
dined
and
spent
the
evening
in
segovia
on
that
same
day
at
noon
my
curiosity
aroused
i
took
train
to
the
town
with
its
wonderful
cathedral
the
alcazar
and
the
aqueduct
built
by
augustus
the
largest
piece
of
roman
work
extant
in
spain
rivalling
as
it
does
the
walls
of
tarragona
without
difficulty
i
discovered
the
fine
country
house
of
the
countess
de
chamartin
situated
high
up
on
the
broad
paseo
she
had
never
seen
me
therefore
i
had
no
hesitation
in
idling
in
the
vicinity
in
order
to
catch
sight
of
her
or
her
niece
their
descriptions
having
been
given
to
me
by
my
friend
hambledon
till
it
was
growing
dark
i
waited
in
vain
when
suddenly
i
had
a
very
narrow
escape
a
big
dusty
grey
limousine
came
rapidly
up
the
hill
and
halted
close
to
where
i
was
standing
from
it
there
alighted
gaston
suzor
who
without
hesitation
entered
the
big
iron
gates
and
disappeared
into
the
garden
fortunately
he
was
in
such
haste
and
so
preoccupied
that
he
did
not
notice
me
hence
i
crossed
the
road
and
hid
behind
a
wall
where
i
had
a
good
view
of
the
car
about
twenty
minutes
later
he
emerged
again
and
with
him
was
a
young
girl
wearing
a
small
toque
and
a
rich
sable
coat
no
second
glance
was
needed
to
realize
that
it
was
the
señorita
carmen
florez
niece
of
the
countess
the
elegant
frenchman
held
the
door
open
politely
for
her
and
after
she
had
entered
he
got
in
beside
her
whereupon
the
car
turned
and
went
down
the
hill
and
out
of
sight
it
occurred
to
me
that
suzor
had
come
from
madrid
to
fetch
her
and
that
surmise
later
proved
to
be
correct
for
on
returning
to
the
capital
at
ten
hambledon
called
at
the
hôtel
de
la
paix
and
as
we
sat
upstairs
in
my
bedroom
he
informed
me
that
the
young
girl
had
arrived
by
car
at
the
ritz
and
had
dined
with
de
gex
and
his
companion
the
countess
who
had
apparently
been
in
madrid
since
the
morning
and
who
had
attended
a
charity
at
the
comedia
had
arrived
at
the
ritz
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
her
niece
it
was
evident
therefore
that
they
were
well
known
to
de
gex
who
as
i
afterwards
ascertained
had
been
a
friend
of
the
late
count
the
four
had
dined
privately
together
in
suzor
and
according
to
the
information
given
to
hambledon
by
the
concierge
a
number
of
papers
had
been
produced
and
examined
immediately
after
the
coffee
had
been
served
i
understand
that
the
production
of
the
papers
had
a
most
disturbing
effect
upon
the
countess
hambledon
told
me
she
gave
vent
to
a
cry
of
amazement
and
afterwards
burst
into
a
fit
of
tears
at
least
that
is
what
the
waiter
told
the
concierge
the
countess
is
very
well
known
at
the
ritz
for
she
moves
in
the
court
circle
and
is
often
at
the
smart
functions
so
constantly
held
there
and
the
niece
i
asked
she
is
certainly
both
smart
and
i
can
discover
but
little
concerning
her
harry
replied
she
is
not
known
at
all
she
has
apparently
only
gone
to
live
with
her
aunt
at
segovia
since
the
count
death
i
wonder
what
was
in
the
papers
which
so
affected
the
lady
i
remarked
de
gex
evidently
invited
them
to
dinner
in
order
to
make
some
disclosure
and
to
prove
it
by
the
production
of
documents
evidently
replied
my
companion
in
any
case
the
countess
and
her
niece
have
just
started
to
return
for
home
the
widow
being
very
upset
at
what
has
been
revealed
to
her
what
can
it
have
been
i
wonder
could
not
the
waiter
ascertain
the
nature
of
the
disclosure
no
i
saw
him
myself
afterwards
and
he
explained
that
the
documents
in
question
were
produced
just
after
he
had
left
the
room
he
heard
the
countess
utter
a
cry
of
dismay
and
when
he
again
entered
the
room
in
pretence
of
clearing
away
the
he
found
the
lady
in
tears
while
her
niece
declared
hotly
in
french
do
not
believe
it
i
will
never
believe
it
a
number
of
legal
documents
were
spread
out
upon
the
table
and
de
gex
was
holding
one
of
them
in
his
hand
then
the
object
of
the
visit
of
the
precious
pair
seems
to
have
been
to
disclose
some
hitherto
secret
to
the
widow
of
the
spanish
financier
eh
yes
my
friend
agreed
it
certainly
seems
so
and
then
he
rose
and
left
downstairs
in
the
palm
court
the
gay
crowd
was
pouring
through
to
the
restaurant
for
supper
after
the
theatre
for
smart
madrid
is
gay
at
night
and
there
is
as
much
dancing
and
fun
there
on
a
smaller
scale
of
course
as
there
is
in
the
west
end
the
pretty
dresses
the
laughter
the
sibilant
whispers
and
the
coat
are
the
same
in
madrid
and
bucharest
as
in
london
or
paris
or
any
other
capital
the
hour
of
midnight
is
the
same
hour
of
relaxation
when
even
judges
smile
after
their
day
upon
the
bench
and
the
will
laugh
at
a
risky
story
so
after
harry
had
gone
refusing
to
have
supper
with
me
lest
somebody
should
notice
us
together
i
strolled
about
and
selecting
a
table
in
the
corner
ate
my
solitary
meal
having
had
no
dinner
that
day
it
was
past
midnight
before
i
ascended
in
the
lift
to
my
room
i
undressed
and
when
in
bed
i
read
the
until
i
suppose
i
dropped
off
to
sleep
i
knew
nothing
until
later
i
was
awakened
by
some
slight
movement
in
an
instant
i
was
seized
by
a
strange
intuition
of
danger
and
my
wits
became
acute
next
second
i
was
on
the
alert
there
had
been
three
lights
burning
when
i
retired
now
there
was
but
one
i
had
bolted
my
door
yet
it
was
now
slightly
ajar
i
lay
and
listened
outside
i
heard
the
hum
of
a
car
receding
across
the
great
square
afterwards
a
church
bell
began
to
clang
discordantly
as
they
all
do
in
spain
the
light
was
over
the
in
the
corner
and
so
shaded
that
the
room
was
quite
dim
someone
had
been
in
my
room
i
grasped
my
automatic
pistol
which
i
kept
under
the
pillow
and
jumping
out
of
bed
crossed
to
the
where
i
had
put
my
watch
and
on
taking
them
from
my
pocket
as
i
did
so
i
heard
the
click
of
an
electric
light
switch
and
next
instant
the
room
was
in
darkness
for
a
second
i
was
nonplussed
i
knew
however
that
i
was
not
alone
in
the
room
so
i
dashed
across
to
the
door
my
pistol
in
my
hand
and
gaining
it
before
the
intruder
could
escape
turned
on
the
lights
before
me
stood
revealed
a
tall
man
in
his
shirt
and
trousers
who
seeing
my
pistol
at
once
put
up
his
hands
crying
in
spanish
ah
no
no
it
is
a
mistake
holy
madonna
i
have
mistaken
the
room
i
thought
my
friend
pedro
was
here
a
thousand
apologies
señor
a
thousand
apologies
but
my
door
was
bolted
how
did
you
get
in
i
demanded
fiercely
no
señor
it
was
not
bolted
i
have
been
taken
very
unwell
i
was
seeking
my
friend
pedro
he
stammered
pale
and
frightened
come
to
my
room
and
i
will
show
you
my
papers
to
prove
that
i
am
no
thief
but
a
advocate
of
burgos
i
told
him
roughly
to
turn
his
face
to
the
wall
while
i
went
through
my
belongings
to
satisfy
myself
that
nothing
had
been
stolen
all
seemed
in
order
and
the
fellow
explanation
seemed
to
be
quite
feasible
save
for
the
fact
that
i
distinctly
remembered
bolting
the
door
nevertheless
i
began
to
wonder
whether
i
had
not
misjudged
him
come
along
to
my
room
señor
he
urged
i
will
show
you
my
identity
papers
i
have
to
offer
you
a
thousand
apologies
i
followed
him
to
a
room
near
the
end
of
the
corridor
where
he
quickly
produced
documents
and
papers
showing
that
his
name
was
juan
salavera
an
advocate
who
lived
in
the
calle
de
vittoria
in
burgos
he
showed
me
the
portrait
of
his
wife
and
child
which
he
carried
in
his
wallet
and
a
small
painted
miniature
of
his
mother
and
other
proofs
of
his
integrity
including
a
case
well
filled
with
notes
i
trust
señor
that
you
will
no
longer
accuse
me
of
being
a
thief
he
said
our
encounter
would
have
been
distinctly
amusing
had
we
not
so
frightened
each
other
as
we
have
done
i
laughed
for
i
felt
convinced
that
he
was
a
respectable
person
and
i
really
began
to
feel
uncomfortable
indeed
i
muttered
an
apology
for
my
rather
rough
behaviour
and
at
the
same
time
i
noticed
upon
the
left
side
of
his
neck
a
deep
scar
probably
left
by
an
abscess
my
dear
señor
it
was
quite
forgiveable
in
the
circumstances
he
declared
offering
me
a
cigarette
and
taking
one
himself
i
had
supper
at
a
restaurant
after
the
theatre
and
ate
something
which
had
disagreed
with
me
half
an
hour
ago
i
felt
faint
so
i
rose
and
went
to
find
my
friend
pedro
espada
who
came
with
me
from
burgos
and
i
entered
your
room
in
mistake
he
must
be
in
the
room
next
yours
shall
we
seek
him
i
asked
no
i
feel
much
better
now
thanks
was
his
reply
the
fright
has
chased
away
all
faintness
besides
we
should
have
to
go
down
to
the
office
and
ascertain
in
which
room
he
really
is
i
shall
be
all
right
now
he
assured
me
he
went
on
to
say
that
he
had
come
to
madrid
in
connexion
with
a
large
estate
in
granada
to
which
a
client
of
his
had
laid
claim
i
shall
be
here
for
a
week
at
least
therefore
i
hope
you
will
give
me
the
pleasure
of
spending
an
evening
with
pedro
and
myself
we
will
dine
at
a
restaurant
and
go
to
one
of
the
variety
theatres
afterwards
i
thanked
him
and
laughing
at
our
encounter
we
parted
quite
good
friends
on
returning
to
my
room
i
examined
the
bolt
and
found
that
the
screws
of
the
brass
socket
had
been
forced
from
the
woodwork
and
it
was
lying
on
the
floor
that
fact
caused
suspicion
to
again
arise
in
my
mind
surely
considerable
force
must
have
been
used
to
break
away
the
socket
from
the
woodwork
yet
i
had
heard
nothing
however
i
returned
to
bed
and
leaving
the
lights
on
i
reflected
upon
the
strange
episode
the
fellow
excuse
was
quite
a
legitimate
one
yet
i
could
not
put
from
myself
the
fact
that
the
door
had
been
forced
by
whom
if
not
by
him
and
yet
he
was
so
cool
it
seemed
impossible
that
he
was
a
thief
whom
i
had
caught
after
half
an
hour
i
rose
again
and
thoroughly
examined
the
bolt
when
my
suspicion
was
increased
by
a
strange
discovery
in
my
absence
the
socket
of
the
bolt
had
been
removed
the
screw
holes
enlarged
and
filled
up
with
bread
kneaded
into
a
paste
into
this
the
screws
had
been
placed
so
that
although
i
had
bolted
the
door
i
could
not
secure
it
for
the
smallest
pressure
from
outside
would
break
the
fastening
from
the
woodwork
the
dodge
was
one
often
practised
by
hotel
thieves
but
what
proof
had
i
that
the
lawyer
from
burgos
had
prepared
that
bolt
i
had
no
means
of
knowing
when
the
screws
had
been
rendered
unstable
or
by
whom
it
might
have
been
done
even
before
i
had
occupied
that
room
for
the
paste
was
hard
and
crumbling
nevertheless
the
fact
remained
that
my
door
had
been
prepared
for
a
midnight
theft
and
i
had
found
a
stranger
in
my
room
so
with
a
resolve
to
make
further
inquiry
next
morning
i
threw
myself
down
and
slept
i
must
have
been
tired
and
overwrought
for
it
was
past
nine
when
i
awoke
and
drew
up
the
blinds
then
as
i
crossed
to
ring
the
bell
for
my
coffee
and
hot
water
i
made
a
very
curious
discovery
chapter
the
sixteenth
another
strange
disclosure
on
the
ground
close
to
my
bed
were
three
carpet
pins
which
had
apparently
spilt
accidentally
out
of
a
box
the
sharp
point
of
each
was
upturned
and
it
was
a
marvel
that
during
the
night
i
had
not
stepped
upon
them
how
had
they
come
there
was
it
by
accident
or
design
that
they
were
beside
my
bed
at
first
i
wondered
whether
the
hotel
upholsterer
had
been
at
work
on
the
previous
day
and
had
left
them
behind
he
might
have
used
them
for
pinning
down
my
carpet
i
took
one
up
and
examined
it
next
second
i
stood
aghast
the
others
i
also
took
up
handling
them
very
gingerly
for
around
the
points
of
each
was
some
colourless
transparent
substance
which
looked
like
vaseline
such
a
substance
was
not
ordinarily
upon
the
points
of
carpet
pins
a
horrible
thought
flashed
across
my
mind
therefore
i
carefully
placed
the
three
pins
upon
the
small
glass
tray
upon
the
and
dressed
as
quickly
as
i
could
reflecting
the
while
upon
my
adventure
with
the
stranger
whom
i
had
taken
to
be
a
thief
i
shaved
swallowed
the
coffee
which
the
young
waiter
brought
me
and
at
once
descended
to
the
bureau
when
in
french
i
inquired
of
the
clerk
for
señor
salavera
he
examined
the
register
and
replied
politely
we
have
no
one
of
that
name
staying
here
señor
what
i
cried
he
was
in
room
last
night
number
was
señor
solier
replied
the
smart
young
clerk
he
paid
his
bill
and
left
just
after
seven
this
morning
but
i
saw
his
identification
papers
his
passport
letters
addressed
to
him
as
señor
salavera
that
may
be
so
señor
was
the
suave
reply
but
he
registered
here
as
señor
solier
and
then
he
dropped
into
english
which
he
spoke
very
fairly
of
course
people
who
stay
at
hotels
do
not
always
give
their
correct
names
they
do
not
wish
them
published
in
lists
in
the
newspapers
perhaps
it
is
only
natural
and
he
smiled
have
you
any
one
named
pedro
espada
in
the
hotel
i
inquired
again
he
consulted
his
register
but
shook
his
head
nobody
of
that
name
he
replied
i
hesitated
then
i
asked
did
the
gentleman
who
spent
the
night
in
room
depart
alone
the
called
the
uniformed
concierge
and
asked
did
number
leave
alone
yes
was
the
reply
he
caught
the
early
express
for
zaragoza
he
was
going
on
to
barcelona
he
told
me
he
went
in
the
omnibus
no
one
with
him
nobody
when
did
he
arrive
i
asked
the
night
before
last
he
was
alone
with
only
a
handbag
i
charged
him
with
a
deposit
for
his
room
have
you
ever
seen
him
before
i
asked
never
to
my
recollection
neither
have
i
remarked
the
concierge
he
seemed
very
afraid
of
being
seen
i
noticed
him
in
the
lounge
last
night
he
left
this
morning
quite
suddenly
and
without
taking
anything
even
a
cup
of
coffee
he
left
in
a
violent
hurry
eh
i
exclaimed
well
knowing
the
reason
well
i
added
i
wish
to
see
the
manager
i
will
inform
him
the
clerk
replied
and
he
went
to
the
telephone
a
minute
later
after
exchanging
a
few
words
in
spanish
he
turned
to
me
saying
you
will
find
the
manager
office
on
the
first
floor
if
you
take
the
lift
the
man
will
direct
you
señor
a
few
minutes
later
i
was
seated
in
the
office
of
an
elderly
man
a
typical
courteous
smiling
and
eager
to
hear
any
complaint
that
i
might
have
to
make
at
once
i
told
him
of
my
curious
adventure
of
the
previous
night
and
of
the
sudden
flight
of
the
mysterious
stranger
whom
i
had
discovered
in
my
room
that
is
certainly
strange
sir
he
replied
in
english
his
excuse
was
a
very
ingenious
one
to
say
the
least
i
think
we
ought
to
inform
the
police
do
you
not
agree
i
told
him
of
my
discovery
of
the
carpet
pins
and
asked
his
advice
as
to
whom
i
might
send
them
for
chemical
analysis
at
once
he
suggested
professor
vega
of
the
princesa
hospital
in
the
calle
alberto
aguilera
adding
the
professor
often
dines
here
if
you
wish
i
will
take
you
to
him
so
still
leaving
the
three
carpet
pins
upon
the
little
glass
tray
i
wrapped
it
in
paper
and
together
we
went
round
to
the
hospital
where
i
was
introduced
to
a
tall
man
in
a
long
linen
coat
to
him
i
explained
how
i
had
found
the
pins
on
the
carpet
beside
my
bed
and
asking
whether
he
would
submit
them
to
examination
he
looked
at
them
critically
first
with
the
naked
eye
and
afterwards
by
means
of
a
large
then
he
grunted
in
dissatisfaction
and
promised
that
next
day
or
the
day
after
he
would
tell
me
the
result
of
his
analysis
as
we
drove
back
to
the
hotel
the
manager
remarked
it
is
a
very
curious
affair
sir
to
say
the
least
one
does
not
scatter
carpet
pins
about
a
bedroom
and
particularly
when
the
points
are
smeared
with
some
mysterious
substance
if
they
had
been
there
before
you
retired
to
bed
the
chambermaid
must
certainly
have
seen
them
she
makes
a
round
of
the
rooms
each
night
at
ten
besides
the
facts
that
the
bolt
had
been
tampered
with
and
also
that
the
man
who
occupied
left
so
early
and
so
hurriedly
are
additionally
suspicious
yes
he
added
i
think
we
ought
to
see
the
police
with
that
object
he
took
me
at
once
to
señor
andrade
the
chief
of
police
a
short
stout
alert
little
man
who
heard
me
with
keen
interest
and
seemed
very
puzzled
the
intruder
explanation
was
certainly
a
very
clever
one
he
remarked
in
french
it
is
a
pity
you
did
not
demand
to
see
his
friend
pedro
espada
if
you
had
you
would
have
discovered
him
to
be
nonexistent
but
he
was
so
clever
i
answered
he
told
me
that
at
that
hour
he
could
not
discover
in
which
room
his
friend
was
really
sleeping
but
the
was
on
duty
exclaimed
the
hotel
manager
he
had
the
register
and
would
have
been
able
at
once
to
tell
you
the
number
of
the
room
the
fellow
seemed
so
frank
in
revealing
to
me
his
money
the
portraits
of
his
family
and
his
private
letters
that
i
had
taken
his
statement
as
the
truth
yet
even
now
i
could
not
believe
that
he
had
any
sinister
design
not
until
the
professor
had
examined
those
three
carpet
pins
in
response
to
close
questions
put
to
me
by
señor
andrade
with
whom
was
señor
rivero
the
head
of
the
detective
branch
i
gave
a
description
of
my
midnight
visitor
as
accurately
as
i
could
i
told
them
how
i
had
covered
him
with
my
automatic
pistol
and
how
afterwards
we
had
laughed
together
at
our
mental
fear
of
each
other
señor
rivero
the
chief
of
the
branch
of
criminal
investigation
suddenly
stopped
me
when
i
mentioned
the
scar
upon
the
neck
of
the
advocate
from
burgos
did
you
notice
that
there
was
any
deformity
of
his
hands
he
asked
quickly
in
an
instant
i
recollected
that
the
little
finger
of
his
right
hand
had
been
amputated
at
the
first
joint
and
i
told
him
so
ah
exclaimed
the
shrewd
official
perhaps
we
may
here
find
something
of
interest
just
a
few
moments
and
he
rose
and
left
us
we
chatted
with
señor
andrade
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
the
detective
returned
with
a
bundle
of
papers
and
four
photographs
of
a
man
taken
in
police
style
upon
one
negative
full
face
half
and
profile
the
instant
he
placed
it
before
me
i
exclaimed
why
that
is
salavera
i
thought
as
much
remarked
the
famous
detective
with
a
grim
smile
he
is
not
salavera
but
rodriquez
despujol
one
of
the
most
dangerous
criminals
in
spain
despujol
cried
señor
andrade
and
he
was
in
madrid
last
night
then
he
added
ah
if
we
had
but
known
true
but
why
was
he
in
the
english
gentleman
room
queried
the
detective
he
is
a
dangerous
character
and
one
would
have
thought
that
instead
of
being
covered
he
would
on
being
cornered
have
drawn
his
knife
and
attacked
his
adversary
despujol
is
no
amateur
the
chief
of
police
agreed
we
wanted
him
for
the
last
five
years
for
the
assassination
of
the
banker
monteros
in
the
train
between
cordova
and
malaga
and
yet
he
always
evades
us
even
though
he
is
one
of
the
most
audacious
thieves
in
europe
but
his
friend
pedro
i
remarked
startled
at
what
i
had
now
learned
he
does
not
exist
replied
the
detective
you
no
doubt
had
a
lucky
escape
had
you
demanded
to
see
his
friend
he
would
no
doubt
have
killed
you
he
is
a
man
of
colossal
strength
a
veritable
tiger
they
say
but
what
was
the
motive
i
asked
i
have
no
valuables
save
my
watch
and
tie
pin
and
fifty
pounds
in
english
money
surely
it
was
not
worth
while
to
kill
me
for
that
no
that
just
it
replied
the
detective
whose
chagrin
was
so
apparent
that
despujol
had
slipped
through
his
fingers
the
game
was
not
worth
the
candle
so
he
returned
after
proving
to
you
his
bona
fides
and
these
bona
fides
he
always
carries
in
order
to
extricate
himself
from
any
ugly
situation
but
the
carpet
pins
asked
the
hotel
manager
the
director
of
the
spanish
secret
police
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
until
professor
vega
can
make
a
report
we
can
do
nothing
it
is
no
use
basing
theories
upon
mere
surmises
so
we
can
only
wait
for
señor
vega
to
tell
us
what
he
discovers
meanwhile
we
will
try
and
secure
despujol
though
i
fear
he
has
too
long
a
start
of
us
he
crossed
the
room
to
the
telephone
and
a
few
minutes
later
spoke
in
spanish
into
the
instrument
in
sharp
authoritative
tones
i
understood
him
to
be
speaking
to
the
police
commissary
at
zaragoza
explaining
that
the
criminal
despujol
had
left
madrid
for
that
city
and
giving
the
train
by
which
he
was
supposed
to
be
travelling
then
in
turn
he
spoke
to
the
commissaries
of
alcazar
salamanca
valladolid
and
arroyo
thus
informing
the
police
along
all
the
lines
of
railway
leading
from
the
capital
it
was
evident
that
what
i
had
told
them
caused
considerable
excitement
indeed
after
the
head
of
the
detective
department
had
concluded
giving
his
instructions
over
the
telephone
he
turned
to
me
and
translated
into
french
the
black
record
of
the
stranger
whom
i
had
discovered
in
my
room
that
he
was
a
bold
and
audacious
criminal
was
quickly
apparent
in
the
sud
express
travelling
between
madrid
and
paris
he
had
drugged
and
robbed
an
italian
jeweller
of
a
wallet
containing
a
quantity
of
diamonds
which
he
took
to
london
at
once
and
disposed
of
to
a
receiver
of
stolen
property
at
kilburn
another
of
his
daring
exploits
was
the
theft
of
the
famous
murillo
from
the
castle
of
setefillas
near
seville
this
he
sold
to
a
dealer
in
brussels
who
afterwards
smuggled
it
to
new
york
where
it
was
bought
by
a
private
collector
for
a
very
large
sum
yet
again
a
few
months
later
he
enticed
a
bank
messenger
in
barcelona
into
a
house
he
had
taken
for
the
purpose
and
having
knocked
him
down
robbed
him
of
his
wallet
containing
a
quantity
of
english
bank
notes
and
negotiable
securities
up
to
five
years
before
he
had
been
convicted
many
times
but
he
now
seemed
to
be
able
to
commit
robberies
with
impunity
and
always
get
off
free
it
was
believed
that
he
lived
in
secret
somewhere
abroad
and
only
came
to
spain
to
commit
thefts
probably
he
passed
to
and
fro
to
france
by
one
of
the
obscure
mountain
tracks
through
the
pyrenees
known
only
to
those
who
dealt
in
contraband
and
there
are
many
in
that
chain
of
mountains
in
any
case
the
police
were
now
hot
again
upon
his
track
suddenly
the
head
of
the
detective
department
had
another
inspiration
and
rang
up
both
jaca
and
pamplona
which
are
at
the
end
of
each
railway
line
towards
the
barrier
of
mountains
which
form
the
french
frontier
if
he
is
on
his
way
to
france
he
will
go
to
either
one
place
or
the
other
he
said
but
have
they
his
photograph
i
asked
a
copy
of
this
photograph
taken
at
the
prison
of
barcelona
is
in
every
detective
office
in
spain
was
his
reply
rodriquez
despujol
is
the
most
dangerous
and
elusive
criminal
at
large
he
went
on
he
never
leaves
anything
to
chance
no
doubt
he
believed
that
you
were
in
possession
of
something
valuable
and
his
intention
was
to
drug
you
and
get
it
but
you
were
too
quick
for
him
my
chief
surprise
is
why
when
he
found
himself
cornered
as
he
was
that
he
did
not
draw
his
knife
and
attack
you
but
i
had
a
pistol
i
said
despujol
does
not
fear
pistols
before
you
could
pull
the
trigger
he
could
have
pounced
upon
you
like
a
cat
replied
the
police
official
well
he
certainly
entirely
misled
me
i
exclaimed
i
even
offered
him
an
apology
for
my
attitude
towards
him
the
three
men
laughed
heartily
an
apology
to
despujol
cried
the
chief
of
police
how
very
amusing
i
consider
that
i
was
very
lucky
i
said
he
seems
to
be
a
most
desperate
character
he
is
answered
señor
andrade
we
have
had
inquiries
for
him
from
all
over
europe
during
the
war
it
seems
that
he
served
as
a
spy
of
germany
in
france
hence
the
military
authorities
there
are
very
anxious
to
get
him
but
you
think
he
lives
in
france
and
crosses
the
frontier
every
now
and
then
yes
we
received
information
to
that
effect
about
a
year
ago
he
probably
lives
as
a
poor
but
perfectly
honest
man
in
one
of
the
remote
villages
in
the
pyrenees
and
is
perhaps
held
in
high
esteem
by
all
around
him
it
was
the
case
of
the
notorious
maurice
tricoche
who
escaped
us
for
years
and
lived
near
luchon
until
he
was
betrayed
by
a
woman
whose
husband
he
had
maltreated
perhaps
despujol
will
also
be
betrayed
we
hope
so
i
can
not
understand
why
the
fellow
dared
to
put
foot
into
madrid
when
he
knows
how
active
we
are
in
search
of
him
remarked
señor
rivero
turning
to
me
he
must
have
followed
you
with
evil
intent
the
explanation
of
mistaking
your
room
was
of
course
a
good
one
but
entirely
false
i
longed
to
tell
the
police
all
about
the
mystery
of
stretton
street
and
the
grave
suspicions
concerning
the
great
international
financier
who
was
at
that
moment
at
the
ritz
yet
i
hesitated
for
two
reasons
the
first
being
that
i
feared
lest
my
story
should
be
disbelieved
and
secondly
because
i
had
on
behalf
of
the
beautiful
girl
with
whom
i
had
fallen
in
love
set
out
to
solve
the
enigma
by
myself
and
bring
the
culprit
to
justice
if
despujol
is
arrested
i
will
willingly
come
forward
and
give
evidence
that
is
if
i
am
still
in
spain
i
promised
but
both
police
officials
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
the
detective
remarked
despujol
is
a
will
o
the
wisp
there
seems
little
hope
of
our
ever
securing
him
nevertheless
we
shall
continue
to
do
our
best
to
allow
you
to
face
him
again
one
day
and
then
señor
you
will
realize
what
a
miraculous
escape
you
have
had
chapter
the
seventeenth
what
the
professor
found
when
i
met
my
friend
hambledon
in
secret
at
two
that
day
under
the
trees
at
a
spot
in
the
retiro
not
far
from
the
great
plaza
de
la
independencia
we
sat
down
and
i
described
to
him
my
strange
midnight
adventure
he
listened
in
amazement
which
was
increased
when
i
told
him
how
the
police
had
recognized
in
the
inoffensive
lawyer
of
burgos
the
notorious
bandit
despujol
who
was
wanted
not
only
by
scotland
yard
but
by
the
police
of
europe
but
those
carpet
pins
are
a
curious
feature
of
the
affair
hughie
he
remarked
yes
the
police
seem
to
attach
no
importance
to
them
but
i
do
so
do
i
the
opinion
of
professor
vega
may
throw
some
light
upon
the
affair
i
shall
call
at
the
princesa
hospital
i
said
and
then
i
inquired
the
latest
information
concerning
de
gex
and
his
french
friend
there
was
little
to
report
de
gex
had
not
been
out
of
the
hotel
though
suzor
had
gone
to
purchase
some
cigars
at
eleven
that
morning
while
suzor
was
absent
de
gex
had
according
to
the
friendly
concierge
received
a
visitor
a
spanish
woman
of
the
she
had
asked
to
see
him
and
on
her
name
being
sent
up
the
great
one
at
once
gave
orders
for
her
to
be
admitted
again
the
floor
waiter
became
inquisitive
and
heard
the
financier
speaking
in
english
with
his
visitor
unfortunate
most
unfortunate
he
heard
de
gex
say
i
am
very
glad
however
that
you
have
come
to
me
so
quickly
you
had
a
telegram
from
siguenza
eh
i
received
it
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
sir
the
woman
had
replied
in
broken
english
then
de
gex
had
apparently
given
her
something
for
her
services
and
dismissed
her
a
telegram
from
siguenza
i
exclaimed
when
my
friend
harry
had
told
me
this
now
siguenza
is
on
the
direct
line
from
here
to
the
pyrenees
and
the
french
frontier
that
telegram
may
be
from
despujol
while
in
flight
if
so
the
police
have
set
a
trap
for
him
at
his
end
either
at
jaca
beneath
mont
perdu
or
at
pamplona
i
wonder
if
he
be
caught
he
might
go
on
to
zaragoza
and
then
turn
to
barcelona
and
marseilles
hambledon
remarked
all
the
frontiers
are
watched
so
it
seems
almost
impossible
for
him
to
escape
but
i
added
i
wonder
if
this
information
conveyed
by
the
spanish
woman
really
concerned
the
fugitive
i
wonder
a
man
like
de
gex
with
so
many
financial
irons
in
the
fire
and
with
agents
in
every
european
capital
is
bound
to
receive
visits
from
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
people
who
bring
him
information
for
profit
when
one
deals
in
colossal
sums
as
he
does
one
has
to
cultivate
people
of
all
classes
hambledon
said
personally
i
do
think
the
woman
information
had
anything
to
do
with
your
mysterious
friend
hurried
departure
he
added
i
do
i
highly
suspicious
there
was
some
motive
that
he
did
not
attack
me
as
he
could
so
easily
have
done
for
he
a
most
desperate
character
and
has
committed
several
murders
when
cornered
his
explanation
was
really
wonderful
and
i
admit
that
i
was
so
completely
deceived
that
i
actually
apologized
to
him
but
i
went
on
we
may
perhaps
know
more
when
we
learn
the
truth
from
professor
vega
hence
at
noon
next
day
i
called
at
the
great
hospital
in
the
calle
alberto
aguilera
and
was
ushered
into
the
professor
room
ah
my
dear
monsieur
he
exclaimed
in
french
knowing
that
i
spoke
spanish
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
i
am
very
glad
you
have
called
those
pins
which
upholsterers
often
use
and
which
you
have
submitted
to
me
are
most
interesting
from
a
toxicological
point
of
view
what
i
gasped
were
they
poisoned
undoubtedly
replied
the
old
expert
and
by
somebody
who
is
with
the
very
latest
and
undetectable
poison
i
searched
for
alkaloids
and
glucosids
and
used
kippenberger
process
and
then
the
tests
of
marne
meyer
scheiblen
and
dragendorff
since
you
brought
the
three
pins
to
me
i
have
been
active
all
the
time
for
the
problem
much
interests
me
at
last
though
i
did
not
think
that
the
substance
could
possibly
contain
so
subtle
deadly
and
as
yet
unknown
poison
i
applied
sonnenschein
reagent
phosphomolybdic
acid
and
then
i
obtained
a
result
only
an
hour
ago
indeed
and
what
was
the
result
professor
he
looked
me
straight
in
the
face
and
replied
you
have
had
a
very
narrow
escape
from
death
monsieur
a
very
narrow
one
had
you
placed
your
foot
upon
one
of
those
upturned
points
you
would
have
fallen
dead
within
five
seconds
why
because
each
of
the
points
of
those
three
pins
left
there
as
though
by
accident
by
some
upholsterer
employed
by
the
hotel
was
impregnated
by
one
of
the
most
deadly
of
all
poisons
it
is
called
by
men
of
my
profession
orosin
after
its
discoverer
orosi
and
is
certainly
a
most
dangerous
poison
in
the
hands
of
anyone
with
criminal
intent
because
no
examination
known
to
the
medical
profession
would
be
able
to
detect
whether
the
victim
had
been
murdered
or
died
of
natural
causes
it
astounds
me
i
gasped
no
doubt
but
to
me
of
course
it
is
a
most
interesting
piece
of
research
and
the
professor
went
on
i
have
never
met
this
substance
before
though
i
had
heard
whispers
of
it
professor
orosi
who
lived
in
cologne
a
few
years
ago
and
is
now
dead
produced
this
poison
quite
accidentally
and
among
his
intimate
friends
disclosed
its
existence
though
he
had
no
idea
how
to
test
for
it
with
certainty
for
five
years
all
toxicologists
made
constant
tests
until
apparently
quite
by
accident
professor
sonnenschein
of
hanover
discovered
the
reagent
which
would
reveal
the
actual
glucosid
and
determine
its
identity
it
gives
a
precipitate
he
added
holding
up
for
my
inspection
a
small
containing
a
liquid
of
the
colour
he
had
indicated
marvellous
i
exclaimed
i
had
no
idea
that
medical
science
could
carry
inquiries
so
far
i
know
that
in
criminal
cases
in
london
our
pathologists
with
their
for
arsenic
fix
the
guilt
upon
poisoners
in
a
manner
most
amazing
but
i
have
never
heard
of
this
secret
and
most
subtle
poison
which
was
placed
beside
my
bed
the
intention
being
for
me
to
tread
upon
the
impregnated
pin
and
if
you
had
done
so
you
would
have
been
taken
with
a
sudden
fatal
seizure
the
cause
of
which
would
never
have
been
detected
you
mean
i
should
have
died
of
poison
you
certainly
would
no
medical
aid
would
have
been
of
any
avail
for
orosin
is
the
most
deadly
substance
which
has
ever
been
discovered
it
is
indeed
good
for
humanity
that
it
is
known
to
only
a
few
toxicologists
but
that
in
itself
reveals
the
fact
monsieur
that
an
exceedingly
clever
and
secret
attack
has
been
made
upon
your
life
a
single
puncture
of
the
skin
with
one
or
other
of
those
pins
which
were
placed
so
conveniently
at
your
bedside
when
you
sprang
out
to
meet
the
intruder
and
you
would
by
this
time
have
been
buried
as
one
whose
death
had
been
due
to
natural
causes
i
held
my
breath
this
declaration
by
one
of
the
greatest
professors
of
toxicology
in
europe
staggered
me
a
dastardly
attempt
had
been
made
upon
me
by
one
of
the
most
notorious
of
modern
criminals
why
no
attempt
at
assassination
is
made
without
some
motive
and
the
game
must
ever
be
worth
the
candle
the
whole
of
the
dramatic
incidents
of
the
night
flashed
across
my
memory
how
i
had
faced
the
fellow
in
my
room
challenged
him
at
the
point
of
my
pistol
and
compelled
him
to
give
me
meekly
proofs
of
his
respectability
truly
it
was
all
humorous
but
only
from
point
of
view
i
recollected
those
pins
which
apparently
had
been
left
so
carelessly
in
my
room
each
held
for
me
a
sudden
and
suspicious
death
the
slightest
puncture
of
the
skin
would
inevitably
prove
fatal
the
professor
continued
feeling
yourself
pricked
you
would
naturally
remove
the
pin
and
very
quickly
afterwards
death
would
supervene
so
prior
to
it
you
yourself
would
no
doubt
have
removed
all
trace
of
the
crime
it
is
as
well
that
such
poison
is
not
generally
known
or
it
would
be
used
by
many
who
wished
to
get
rid
of
their
friends
i
remarked
the
professor
laughed
and
agreed
saying
there
are
several
poisons
of
the
same
type
which
are
known
only
to
toxicologists
and
we
are
very
careful
not
to
allow
the
public
sufficient
knowledge
of
them
i
must
confess
that
i
never
dreamed
when
i
commenced
my
investigations
that
i
was
in
the
presence
of
orosin
there
is
sufficient
in
this
little
tube
and
he
held
it
to
the
light
to
kill
a
hundred
persons
it
certainly
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
of
known
compounds
so
it
is
evident
that
the
man
despujol
entered
my
room
and
placed
the
pins
there
intending
that
i
should
step
upon
one
or
other
of
them
i
gasped
without
doubt
and
it
seems
little
short
of
a
marvel
that
you
escaped
said
the
professor
it
certainly
does
i
remarked
but
i
must
tell
the
police
of
the
fact
you
have
established
the
affair
now
assumes
a
new
phase
the
man
was
not
in
my
room
with
the
intention
of
robbery
but
in
order
to
encompass
my
death
by
secret
means
if
you
had
not
so
fortunately
avoided
treading
upon
the
pins
you
certainly
would
not
be
alive
at
the
moment
remarked
the
professor
again
reflectively
examining
the
yellow
fluid
in
the
tube
what
motive
could
the
man
have
had
in
gaining
access
to
your
room
and
placing
the
pins
there
i
suppose
he
did
not
risk
putting
them
there
before
you
went
to
bed
as
you
might
have
picked
one
up
on
your
boot
and
that
would
have
drawn
your
attention
to
them
by
placing
them
there
after
you
were
in
bed
he
hoped
that
on
getting
out
your
bare
foot
would
come
into
contact
with
one
of
the
impregnated
points
it
was
certainly
a
most
fiendish
plot
i
declared
and
i
thank
you
professor
for
taking
all
this
trouble
with
your
analysis
and
so
establishing
the
truth
i
will
go
to
the
police
and
inform
them
yes
i
wish
you
to
do
that
for
the
fellow
is
undoubtedly
in
possession
of
orosin
and
intends
to
use
it
perhaps
he
has
already
killed
people
by
the
same
subtle
and
secret
means
he
must
be
arrested
at
all
costs
i
said
already
the
police
all
over
spain
are
watching
for
him
and
special
surveillance
is
being
kept
along
all
the
railways
and
on
the
frontier
any
person
with
orosin
in
his
possession
should
be
detained
and
examined
the
professor
declared
i
wonder
where
he
obtained
it
who
knows
i
exclaimed
but
i
was
reflecting
whether
after
all
my
presence
in
madrid
was
not
known
to
de
gex
if
so
was
it
possible
that
he
had
hired
the
notorious
despujol
to
attack
me
in
secret
of
course
we
know
that
there
is
a
secret
traffic
in
poisons
with
the
police
have
established
that
fact
over
and
over
again
said
professor
vega
but
the
vendors
are
very
difficult
to
trace
one
was
found
only
six
months
ago
a
doctor
living
in
a
suburb
of
copenhagen
but
orosin
is
not
known
to
a
dozen
people
beyond
those
who
study
toxicology
hence
this
man
despujol
must
have
been
supplied
with
it
by
someone
who
knew
the
suspicion
had
arisen
in
my
mind
that
de
gex
and
his
agent
suzor
knew
that
i
was
in
madrid
for
the
purpose
of
watching
them
and
they
had
resorted
to
a
very
clever
and
secret
means
of
getting
rid
of
me
once
and
for
all
if
the
notorious
criminal
despujol
was
in
their
pay
he
would
no
doubt
afterwards
blackmail
them
now
that
the
desperate
plot
had
failed
again
could
it
be
possible
that
moroni
had
had
any
hand
in
supplying
this
most
effective
and
dangerous
of
all
secret
poisons
to
the
spanish
malefactor
who
snapped
his
defiant
fingers
under
the
very
nose
of
the
police
as
i
sat
in
that
quiet
room
of
the
professor
a
room
that
smelt
strongly
of
chemicals
though
it
was
filled
mostly
with
books
i
could
not
refrain
from
shuddering
when
i
reflected
upon
the
narrow
escape
i
had
had
yet
if
de
gex
resorted
to
such
measures
he
must
certainly
hold
me
in
great
fear
besides
if
my
life
was
threatened
so
also
was
that
of
my
friend
harry
hambledon
who
remained
so
vigilant
in
the
serene
belief
that
his
presence
was
undetected
at
that
time
i
never
dreamed
that
the
great
financier
who
controlled
the
destinies
of
certain
european
states
never
moved
without
a
police
official
being
in
attendance
and
that
surveillance
was
kept
upon
him
as
though
he
were
royalty
travelling
incognito
de
gex
it
seemed
was
ever
afraid
that
one
of
his
enemies
the
hundreds
whom
he
had
ruined
by
dint
of
sharp
practice
unscrupulous
dealing
and
flagrant
bribery
might
seek
revenge
hence
though
neither
hambledon
nor
myself
knew
of
it
both
de
gex
and
his
toady
and
agent
gaston
suzor
were
well
aware
of
our
presence
and
moreover
were
kept
posted
concerning
our
movements
from
day
to
day
though
we
were
in
ignorance
of
all
this
yet
the
desperate
nature
of
the
plot
against
me
caused
me
to
wonder
what
exactly
was
the
fear
in
which
de
gex
held
me
of
course
it
concerned
gabrielle
tennison
but
exactly
how
i
failed
to
surmise
one
thing
was
certain
that
the
of
europe
intended
to
rid
himself
of
me
and
in
this
he
was
being
aided
by
certain
of
his
friends
chief
among
whom
were
suzor
and
moroni
that
the
assassin
despujol
was
only
a
paid
servant
was
quite
clear
but
the
pay
must
have
been
a
very
handsome
sum
to
cause
him
to
dare
to
come
to
madrid
so
boldly
and
run
the
risk
of
arrest
i
smiled
at
my
own
innocence
when
i
remembered
how
completely
he
had
imposed
upon
me
by
showing
me
his
papers
of
identity
and
the
photographs
of
his
pretended
family
truly
only
a
great
criminal
could
have
remained
so
imperturbed
and
polite
to
the
man
whom
he
intended
should
die
this
drug
orosin
is
a
very
mysterious
one
i
suppose
i
remarked
a
few
seconds
later
as
the
professor
who
had
offered
me
a
cigar
was
in
the
act
of
lighting
up
yes
a
very
weak
solution
taken
by
the
mouth
produces
extraordinary
effects
upon
the
human
brain
the
latter
almost
instantly
becomes
unbalanced
and
the
victim
lapses
into
an
unconscious
state
for
days
even
for
weeks
he
said
very
often
the
brain
is
quite
normal
save
that
a
complete
loss
of
memory
follows
the
return
to
consciousness
in
other
cases
orosin
has
produced
complete
and
hopeless
dementia
always
hopeless
i
asked
eagerly
recollecting
my
own
case
and
that
of
gabrielle
tennison
not
always
hopeless
there
have
been
cases
that
have
been
cured
do
you
know
any
personally
i
demanded
breathlessly
there
are
one
or
two
very
few
on
record
professor
gourbeil
the
alienist
of
lyons
has
observed
two
patients
who
recovered
but
the
majority
of
cases
where
orosin
has
been
administered
were
found
incurable
the
mind
is
blank
the
memory
completely
destroyed
and
the
general
health
so
undermined
that
only
the
strongest
persons
can
withstand
the
strain
at
once
i
described
gabrielle
symptoms
and
general
attitude
whereupon
the
professor
said
what
you
tell
me
are
the
exact
symptoms
exhibited
by
a
person
to
whom
a
small
dose
of
orosin
has
been
administered
in
most
cases
however
such
a
state
of
mind
develops
into
actual
insanity
with
a
homicidal
tendency
such
a
patient
should
be
very
carefully
watched
for
in
ninety
per
cent
the
chance
of
a
cure
is
alas
beyond
expectation
chapter
the
eighteenth
more
about
the
one
very
important
fact
i
had
established
orosin
was
the
obscure
and
drug
that
had
been
administered
to
gabrielle
tennison
as
well
as
to
myself
by
the
of
europe
at
his
palatial
house
in
stretton
street
gabrielle
being
the
weaker
was
still
suffering
from
its
paralysing
effects
while
i
the
stronger
had
practically
recovered
yet
it
had
been
intended
by
the
daring
despujol
that
a
fatal
accident
should
now
befall
me
and
could
anything
be
plainer
than
that
the
fellow
for
whom
the
police
were
searching
so
eagerly
was
a
hireling
of
the
man
de
gex
who
went
in
fear
of
me
that
most
secret
and
most
potent
of
all
poisons
might
be
known
to
moroni
indeed
it
apparently
was
known
to
him
and
the
endeavour
had
been
to
introduce
it
into
my
system
by
means
of
an
infected
carpet
pin
on
leaving
professor
vega
i
at
once
sent
a
note
round
to
hambledon
and
awaited
his
arrival
when
he
came
i
related
all
the
professor
had
told
me
well
hugh
he
said
we
now
know
the
truth
and
it
remains
for
us
to
combat
the
fiends
if
you
are
marked
down
no
doubt
i
am
also
so
it
behoves
us
both
to
be
very
wary
why
ca
we
tell
the
police
the
whole
circumstances
i
suggested
my
dear
fellow
they
would
believe
you
and
they
would
arrest
such
a
powerful
man
as
oswald
de
gex
was
his
serious
reply
money
can
buy
immunity
from
arrest
in
every
country
in
europe
and
especially
de
gex
money
for
it
can
be
distributed
in
secret
by
his
agents
no
if
we
are
to
be
successful
we
must
lay
our
plans
just
as
cleverly
as
he
lays
his
we
must
allow
him
to
believe
that
we
are
entirely
unsuspicious
of
his
plotting
that
is
our
only
way
i
realized
that
there
was
much
truth
in
his
argument
it
remained
with
us
to
pretend
ignorance
therefore
we
resolved
to
still
watch
and
wait
a
few
hours
later
i
told
señor
andrade
the
chief
of
police
of
the
professor
discovery
that
the
points
of
the
pins
had
been
infected
with
orosin
the
newly
discovered
drug
which
in
small
doses
produced
loss
of
memory
and
insanity
and
in
larger
doses
sudden
death
in
reply
he
informed
me
that
though
every
effort
had
been
made
to
trace
the
elusive
fugitive
all
had
been
in
vain
and
that
he
was
still
at
large
but
if
he
has
this
terrible
drug
in
his
possession
he
is
more
than
ever
a
danger
to
society
the
spanish
official
went
on
speaking
in
french
i
thank
you
for
all
the
information
you
have
given
me
and
you
may
rely
upon
me
to
take
every
possible
step
towards
securing
his
arrest
i
was
in
telegraphic
communication
with
the
paris
sûreté
only
this
morning
concerning
him
i
will
wire
them
again
they
have
been
stirred
into
activity
by
the
message
i
sent
them
after
your
call
to
see
me
i
longed
again
to
be
frank
with
the
affable
señor
andrade
yet
i
saw
that
if
i
were
i
might
negative
all
chance
of
solving
the
problem
which
concerned
the
health
and
life
of
the
girl
whom
i
had
grown
to
love
so
fervently
upon
a
sudden
impulse
i
remarked
with
affected
carelessness
i
hear
that
our
english
financier
de
gex
is
at
the
ritz
yes
he
replied
he
is
here
under
an
assumed
name
in
connexion
with
some
big
railway
scheme
in
estremadura
a
line
between
toledo
and
merida
it
is
badly
wanted
and
has
been
talked
of
for
years
there
is
a
huge
stretch
of
country
south
of
the
tagus
as
far
as
villa
nueva
without
any
railway
communication
the
king
himself
has
been
agitating
for
the
development
of
that
rich
agricultural
region
for
the
last
ten
years
and
now
it
seems
as
though
your
great
financier
monsieur
de
gex
is
here
to
consult
with
the
ministry
of
communications
yes
i
said
realizing
in
what
high
esteem
that
of
millions
was
held
i
do
not
think
i
would
care
to
have
such
colossal
wealth
as
his
remarked
the
chief
of
police
as
soon
as
he
arrived
from
paris
i
had
orders
from
the
ministry
to
place
him
under
surveillance
because
it
seems
he
goes
in
fear
of
some
personal
attack
upon
him
by
whom
i
asked
instantly
interested
the
information
is
vague
was
his
reply
then
taking
up
a
large
yellow
paper
from
his
desk
he
said
it
seems
that
he
has
applied
to
the
ministry
for
personal
protection
and
for
a
daily
report
of
anyone
who
may
be
keeping
observation
upon
him
there
is
a
young
englishman
living
at
the
palace
hotel
who
seems
unduly
interested
in
the
gentleman
movements
we
are
watching
him
i
held
my
breath
this
was
an
unexpected
revelation
de
gex
was
in
fear
of
us
and
had
resorted
to
that
ruse
in
order
to
keep
himself
posted
upon
hambledon
movements
truly
the
situation
was
daily
growing
more
complicated
surely
such
a
man
as
de
gex
a
man
who
is
noted
not
only
for
his
immense
wealth
but
for
his
generous
contributions
to
charity
could
not
have
enemies
i
remarked
everyone
has
enemies
my
dear
was
the
police
suave
reply
señor
de
gex
was
here
in
madrid
a
year
ago
when
he
made
a
similar
application
to
the
ministry
for
personal
surveillance
he
was
here
in
connexion
with
the
foundation
of
the
new
madrid
and
southern
spain
banking
corporation
which
is
guaranteed
by
a
group
of
french
and
dutch
financiers
of
whom
señor
de
gex
is
the
head
he
paused
and
then
continued
he
seems
highly
strung
and
nervous
all
men
who
are
in
the
public
eye
seem
to
be
the
same
foreigners
visiting
madrid
often
apply
for
surveillance
yet
there
is
certainly
no
need
of
it
and
i
confess
to
you
that
my
staff
is
after
all
unduly
worked
i
can
quite
imagine
that
i
said
but
is
a
strict
watch
kept
upon
de
gex
yes
and
upon
his
agent
monsieur
suzor
also
has
monsieur
suzor
been
in
madrid
before
he
was
here
two
years
ago
when
señor
de
gex
had
some
big
financial
deal
with
the
count
chamartin
who
was
head
of
the
miramar
shipping
company
of
barcelona
they
say
he
bought
the
whole
fleet
of
steamers
from
count
chamartin
was
count
chamartin
wealthy
yes
a
millionaire
without
a
doubt
but
it
is
said
that
shortly
before
his
death
he
quarrelled
with
his
wife
why
nobody
knows
she
lives
at
segovia
and
their
house
here
in
the
capital
has
just
been
sold
was
any
attempt
made
upon
de
gex
i
asked
well
a
mysterious
young
frenchman
called
one
night
at
the
ritz
and
demanded
to
see
him
he
was
very
excited
and
when
he
was
refused
admission
upstairs
he
flourished
a
revolver
my
agent
on
duty
arrested
the
stranger
who
was
after
examination
deported
for
that
señor
de
gex
sent
me
a
letter
of
thanks
and
the
which
you
see
i
wear
the
pin
he
indicated
consisted
of
a
single
black
pearl
with
the
base
surrounded
by
diamonds
an
expensive
piece
of
jewellery
that
in
itself
was
sufficient
to
show
that
oswald
de
gex
was
a
in
the
art
of
bribery
and
that
he
had
established
in
the
minds
of
the
authorities
of
the
spanish
capital
that
when
he
came
there
he
came
in
the
interests
of
the
government
and
hence
he
could
do
no
wrong
ah
how
i
longed
to
be
able
to
tell
my
story
to
that
charming
official
but
i
saw
that
if
i
did
so
he
would
not
only
disbelieve
me
but
put
me
down
as
an
exaggerating
fool
so
i
held
my
tongue
i
further
questioned
him
concerning
de
gex
and
his
friend
suzor
monsieur
suzor
has
been
in
madrid
before
he
said
he
is
agent
of
señor
de
gex
but
how
wealthy
the
latter
must
be
during
the
war
he
made
a
big
loan
to
our
government
the
real
extent
of
it
is
not
known
but
some
say
that
he
can
pull
the
strings
of
the
cabinet
in
any
way
he
wishes
though
the
king
disapproved
of
the
whole
transaction
at
least
that
is
the
rumour
yet
after
all
señor
de
gex
is
a
true
friend
of
spain
even
though
he
like
all
financiers
obtains
huge
percentages
upon
his
loans
true
i
laughed
men
of
wealth
are
seldom
philanthropists
one
finds
more
true
philanthropy
among
the
poor
and
in
the
artistic
circles
of
lower
bohemia
than
in
the
circles
of
the
philanthropy
is
not
written
in
the
dictionary
of
the
those
blatant
profiteers
with
their
motors
and
their
places
in
the
country
who
having
fattened
upon
the
lives
of
the
brave
fellows
who
fought
and
died
to
save
europe
from
the
unholy
hun
are
now
enjoying
their
lives
while
the
widows
and
orphans
of
heroes
starve
ah
garfield
with
that
i
entirely
agree
sighed
the
astute
man
seated
at
his
with
the
three
telephones
at
his
elbow
in
my
official
career
as
head
of
the
police
department
of
madrid
i
have
watched
recent
events
and
i
have
seen
how
men
who
were
little
removed
from
the
category
of
the
worst
criminals
have
suddenly
jumped
into
wealth
with
its
consequent
notoriety
and
the
power
which
is
inseparable
from
the
possessor
of
money
the
international
financier
oswald
de
gex
is
one
of
those
i
said
you
can
not
close
your
eyes
to
that
fact
you
appear
to
entertain
some
antipathy
towards
him
he
remarked
a
little
surprised
it
seemed
no
not
at
all
i
assured
him
smiling
i
only
speak
broadly
all
these
great
financiers
fatten
upon
the
ruin
of
honest
folk
i
hardly
think
that
such
is
the
case
with
señor
de
gex
he
remarked
but
you
are
english
and
you
probably
know
more
than
myself
concerning
his
career
nobody
in
england
knows
much
about
him
was
my
reply
we
only
know
that
he
is
immensely
wealthy
and
that
his
riches
are
daily
increased
by
the
various
ventures
which
he
finances
he
is
a
great
support
to
our
ministry
of
finance
declared
the
chief
of
police
it
was
count
chamartin
who
first
interested
him
in
spain
i
believe
in
any
case
they
combined
to
finance
a
number
of
industrial
enterprises
including
the
great
guadajoz
copper
mine
which
must
in
itself
have
brought
them
both
a
fortune
you
said
that
the
count
is
dead
i
remarked
yes
he
died
quite
suddenly
last
year
he
was
one
of
the
most
popular
men
at
court
and
his
tragic
death
caused
a
great
sensation
he
was
taken
ill
in
the
sud
express
while
travelling
from
madrid
to
keep
an
appointment
with
señor
de
gex
in
paris
and
though
he
was
taken
from
the
train
on
its
arrival
at
san
sebastian
and
conveyed
to
the
hospital
he
died
a
few
moments
after
reaching
there
he
had
a
weak
heart
and
had
consulted
two
doctors
only
a
month
previously
they
had
ordered
him
a
complete
rest
and
change
but
contrary
to
their
advice
he
continued
attending
to
his
affairs
with
fatal
result
and
the
countess
ah
poor
lady
she
was
beside
herself
with
grief
she
was
his
second
wife
his
first
was
the
daughter
of
an
englishman
who
lived
in
madrid
the
present
countess
is
the
daughter
of
the
marquis
avellanosa
of
algeciras
and
they
were
a
most
devoted
pair
she
now
lives
in
segovia
in
comparative
seclusion
the
count
untimely
end
was
a
great
loss
to
spain
it
was
news
to
me
that
oswald
de
gex
was
in
madrid
with
his
agent
suzor
in
connexion
with
the
new
railway
scheme
indeed
what
i
had
just
been
told
was
all
amazing
and
showed
de
gex
to
be
a
man
of
outstanding
genius
the
of
europe
took
good
care
to
inform
himself
of
any
person
who
watched
his
movements
or
sought
to
inquire
into
his
business
it
certainly
was
a
to
pretend
fear
of
assassination
and
compel
the
police
to
act
as
his
personal
guard
by
that
means
he
had
learnt
that
hambledon
and
myself
were
in
madrid
on
purpose
to
discover
what
we
could
hence
he
had
hired
the
assassin
despujol
to
set
that
dastardly
trap
for
me
again
it
was
upon
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
reveal
the
suspicions
i
had
of
the
great
financier
but
i
refrained
because
i
could
see
that
my
companion
held
de
gex
in
high
esteem
as
a
friend
and
financial
mainstay
of
his
country
a
few
moments
later
i
reverted
to
the
possibility
of
the
arrest
of
despujol
for
if
arrested
he
might
betray
de
gex
as
the
person
who
had
paid
him
to
place
those
infected
pins
in
my
room
in
such
case
my
story
would
be
heard
and
investigated
but
the
chief
of
police
shook
his
head
dubiously
i
fear
that
he
has
again
gone
into
safe
hiding
up
in
the
mountains
somewhere
without
a
doubt
he
replied
it
was
an
act
of
considerable
daring
to
come
boldly
to
madrid
and
stay
at
your
hotel
when
he
knows
full
well
the
for
him
is
raised
everywhere
and
that
there
is
actually
ten
thousand
pesetas
offered
as
reward
for
his
capture
someone
may
betray
him
i
suggested
with
a
smile
yes
we
hope
so
one
of
his
friends
male
or
female
will
no
doubt
do
so
and
come
one
day
to
us
for
the
reward
not
till
then
shall
we
know
the
truth
of
that
strange
attempt
upon
your
life
the
motive
could
not
have
been
robbery
as
you
had
nothing
worth
taking
save
your
watch
if
he
had
been
found
in
de
gex
room
at
the
ritz
one
could
have
understood
it
i
smiled
the
chief
of
police
never
suspected
the
true
facts
of
the
case
facts
within
my
own
knowledge
which
were
of
such
an
amazing
and
startling
character
that
i
hesitated
to
relate
them
when
i
left
my
friend
i
again
sought
hambledon
and
told
him
all
i
had
learnt
h
he
grunted
very
wily
of
de
gex
to
get
the
police
to
keep
an
eye
upon
me
if
i
not
careful
i
shall
suddenly
find
myself
under
arrest
as
a
suspicious
person
who
is
in
the
habit
of
loitering
in
the
vicinity
of
the
great
financier
yes
i
agreed
this
seems
to
put
an
end
to
our
present
activity
does
it
not
well
he
apparently
knows
that
we
are
watching
hambledon
said
what
a
pity
we
can
not
tell
the
police
all
we
know
if
we
did
we
should
not
be
believed
and
moreover
they
hear
a
word
against
the
great
man
who
is
such
a
friend
to
spain
money
buys
reputation
remember
nobody
knows
that
better
than
de
gex
hambledon
was
standing
at
my
bedroom
window
looking
thoughtfully
down
upon
the
puerta
del
sol
with
its
crowd
of
hurrying
it
seems
a
miserable
ending
to
all
our
careful
surveillance
upon
suzor
does
it
he
grumbled
true
it
does
but
now
that
the
pair
are
on
the
alert
i
can
not
see
that
anything
can
be
gained
by
remaining
in
madrid
longer
i
pointed
out
then
you
intend
to
give
up
the
quest
for
the
truth
not
by
any
means
i
replied
quickly
i
intend
at
all
hazards
and
at
all
costs
to
still
fathom
the
mystery
what
we
have
learned
since
we
came
to
spain
puts
quite
a
different
complexion
upon
matters
we
are
now
in
possession
of
certain
facts
concerning
de
gex
facts
of
which
we
had
no
suspicion
we
had
never
dreamed
that
to
further
his
ends
he
did
not
hesitate
to
employ
a
notorious
criminal
to
commit
murder
with
malice
aforethought
neither
did
we
know
anything
of
his
financial
dealings
with
the
spanish
ministry
of
finance
or
his
partnership
with
the
conde
de
chamartin
or
that
the
drug
he
used
upon
poor
gabrielle
and
myself
was
the
obscure
but
most
deadly
and
dangerous
orosin
all
these
are
points
which
may
in
the
near
future
be
of
greatest
advantage
to
us
therefore
we
must
not
despair
let
us
take
courage
and
continue
to
probe
the
mystery
for
the
sake
of
poor
gabrielle
tennison
i
urged
let
us
act
as
quietly
and
discreetly
as
our
enemy
is
acting
and
we
may
yet
attain
success
chapter
the
nineteenth
the
track
of
despujol
having
decided
to
still
remain
in
madrid
i
deemed
it
advisable
to
engage
the
services
of
a
private
inquiry
agent
to
watch
the
movements
of
de
gex
and
suzor
who
still
remained
at
the
ritz
the
living
under
an
assumed
name
never
went
out
in
the
daytime
though
suzor
often
went
forth
paying
visits
to
certain
banks
and
commercial
offices
in
connexion
with
the
proposed
new
railway
the
man
we
engaged
was
an
elderly
of
the
seville
police
named
pardo
who
very
soon
discovered
the
identity
of
the
secret
agent
employed
to
keep
surveillance
upon
de
gex
on
behalf
of
the
police
so
that
no
harm
should
befall
him
in
consequence
i
took
pardo
into
my
confidence
and
calling
him
to
my
hotel
explained
that
i
desired
to
keep
secret
watch
upon
the
frenchman
suzor
without
the
knowledge
of
the
detective
watching
de
gex
i
particularly
desire
to
know
the
addresses
of
any
telegram
which
suzor
may
send
probably
he
may
send
some
message
to
italy
if
so
please
discover
the
address
and
the
text
of
the
message
i
believed
that
de
gex
might
communicate
with
moroni
now
that
the
plot
of
despujol
had
failed
i
will
watch
señor
was
the
spaniard
reply
if
señor
suzor
sends
any
telegram
i
shall
probably
obtain
a
copy
of
it
they
know
me
well
at
the
chief
telegraph
office
señor
suzor
appears
to
be
transacting
a
considerable
amount
of
business
in
madrid
a
scheme
for
a
new
railway
i
understand
yes
i
know
all
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
find
out
who
visits
de
gex
and
whether
any
telegrams
are
sent
by
either
him
or
mr
suzor
i
quite
understand
señor
was
the
detective
reply
as
he
rose
and
a
few
minutes
later
withdrew
late
in
the
evening
two
days
afterwards
i
returned
to
the
hotel
to
find
the
man
pardo
awaiting
me
after
i
had
taken
him
up
to
my
room
and
closed
the
door
he
drew
a
piece
of
paper
from
his
pocket
saying
in
french
señor
suzor
sent
a
telegram
at
eight
this
evening
of
which
this
is
a
copy
the
message
he
handed
me
was
in
a
pencilled
scribble
and
was
in
english
as
follows
charles
rabel
rue
de
lalande
important
that
i
should
see
you
meet
me
at
hôtel
luxembourg
nîmes
without
fail
next
monday
at
o
the
initial
o
stood
for
oswald
oswald
de
gex
so
the
of
europe
contemplated
leaving
madrid
i
thanked
the
man
pardo
who
said
señor
suzor
did
not
dispatch
the
telegram
from
the
chief
office
in
the
calle
del
correo
but
from
the
branch
office
in
the
plaza
del
progreso
he
apparently
wished
to
send
it
in
secret
i
wonder
why
i
asked
the
spaniard
raised
his
shoulders
the
address
conveyed
nothing
to
me
but
the
message
was
proof
that
de
gex
intended
to
leave
spain
and
further
it
was
a
source
of
satisfaction
to
know
his
destination
in
case
he
slipped
away
suddenly
after
pardo
had
gone
i
sat
and
pondered
it
struck
me
as
very
curious
that
suzor
should
have
gone
to
a
distant
telegraph
office
in
order
to
send
the
message
it
seemed
that
he
feared
to
be
recognized
by
the
at
the
chief
telegraph
office
for
over
an
hour
i
smoked
reflectively
i
confess
that
a
curious
suspicion
had
arisen
in
my
mind
a
suspicion
that
became
so
strong
that
just
about
eleven
i
entered
the
jefatura
superior
de
policia
in
the
calle
de
la
princesa
and
again
inquired
for
señor
andrade
fortunately
he
had
been
detained
in
his
office
and
i
was
shown
into
his
presence
he
seemed
surprised
to
see
me
but
at
once
he
became
interested
when
i
said
i
have
a
distinct
suspicion
that
i
know
the
whereabouts
of
despujol
have
you
he
exclaimed
quickly
what
causes
you
to
suspect
a
man
whom
i
believe
to
be
an
acquaintance
of
his
has
sent
an
urgent
telegram
to
charles
rabel
rue
de
lalande
in
montauban
in
france
making
an
appointment
to
meet
him
at
the
hôtel
luxembourg
at
nîmes
next
monday
at
noon
who
is
his
friend
he
asked
eagerly
i
regret
señor
andrade
that
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
answer
that
question
the
whole
matter
is
only
one
of
suspicion
very
strong
suspicion
the
chief
of
police
looked
very
straight
at
me
ah
then
you
are
in
possession
of
certain
secret
knowledge
concerning
the
man
who
made
such
a
dastardly
attempt
upon
your
life
he
remarked
and
you
suspect
this
charles
rabel
at
montauban
to
be
the
fugitive
eh
exactly
i
replied
he
asked
me
to
repeat
the
address
which
he
scribbled
down
and
then
looking
up
said
personally
señor
garfield
i
think
your
suspicions
are
unfounded
despujol
if
he
is
ever
found
will
be
discovered
in
hiding
somewhere
in
the
mountains
of
the
north
but
why
not
in
montauban
i
asked
he
is
apparently
a
man
judging
from
his
conversation
with
me
he
speaks
french
well
and
perhaps
passes
as
a
french
subject
he
could
pass
for
a
spaniard
an
italian
a
greek
or
a
frenchman
andrade
remarked
and
as
forged
passports
are
so
cheap
nowadays
and
almost
impossible
to
detect
the
means
of
escape
of
such
a
daring
criminal
are
both
numerous
and
easy
but
he
added
i
am
interested
in
this
person
whom
you
believe
to
be
a
friend
of
the
fugitive
can
not
you
tell
me
who
he
is
i
shook
my
head
and
smiling
replied
i
have
only
come
here
to
tell
you
of
a
very
distinct
suspicion
i
entertain
that
despujol
is
at
montauban
then
his
friend
is
your
enemy
eh
he
suggested
his
dark
penetrating
eyes
fixed
upon
mine
you
know
the
motive
of
that
trap
which
despujol
set
for
you
and
yet
you
will
not
reveal
it
to
me
again
i
shook
my
head
and
smiled
it
would
make
my
task
much
easier
he
remarked
i
am
aware
of
that
but
at
present
mine
is
only
a
suspicion
i
have
no
actual
knowledge
that
charles
rabel
is
the
man
you
are
so
desirous
of
arresting
and
you
really
refuse
to
tell
me
who
sent
this
message
he
asked
in
a
tone
of
disappointment
it
was
sent
in
secret
i
answered
indeed
it
was
that
fact
which
caused
me
to
suspect
you
can
of
course
obtain
the
original
of
the
telegram
by
applying
for
it
from
the
authorities
but
it
is
only
signed
by
an
initial
how
did
you
obtain
knowledge
of
it
again
i
have
no
intention
of
disclosing
the
source
of
my
information
señor
andrade
i
replied
as
politely
as
i
could
i
am
as
a
matter
of
fact
here
in
madrid
attempting
to
solve
a
very
remarkable
mystery
which
occurred
in
london
a
few
months
ago
this
is
most
interesting
you
never
told
me
that
before
he
exclaimed
i
confess
i
wondered
with
what
motive
you
and
your
friend
señor
hambledon
living
at
separate
hotels
had
in
remaining
here
it
was
regarded
as
suspicious
by
the
detective
force
that
being
such
intimate
friends
you
lived
at
separate
hotels
and
met
only
in
secret
reports
have
reached
me
of
your
movements
and
of
your
meetings
he
laughed
more
than
once
you
have
been
regarded
as
suspected
persons
he
added
well
i
hope
you
do
not
regard
me
as
a
suspected
person
any
longer
señor
andrade
i
exclaimed
with
a
smile
no
no
he
laughed
but
i
confess
you
are
something
of
a
mystery
why
should
the
notorious
despujol
dare
to
put
his
foot
into
madrid
and
lay
that
deadly
plot
to
kill
you
you
know
the
motive
and
yet
you
will
not
disclose
it
to
me
not
at
present
i
said
if
it
is
found
that
charles
rabel
is
really
despujol
then
i
will
come
forward
and
state
all
that
i
know
you
promise
that
i
do
very
well
then
i
will
give
orders
to
have
your
suspicions
investigated
replied
the
patient
urbane
official
a
detective
shall
leave
by
the
next
train
for
montauban
with
a
request
to
the
prefect
of
police
of
the
department
of
for
the
arrest
of
the
individual
in
question
if
he
should
be
identified
then
i
will
accompany
him
i
said
excellent
he
exclaimed
it
would
be
well
if
señor
rivero
the
head
of
the
detective
department
whom
you
have
met
went
in
person
to
france
i
will
ring
him
up
at
his
house
he
took
up
the
telephone
and
a
few
minutes
later
spoke
rapidly
in
spanish
to
the
chief
detective
of
spain
presently
after
a
rapid
conversation
he
put
down
the
receiver
and
said
señor
rivero
will
meet
you
at
the
delicias
station
at
two
morning
the
express
for
barcelona
leaves
at
from
barcelona
you
can
get
direct
to
nîmes
and
on
to
montauban
and
he
added
i
only
hope
you
will
be
successful
in
arresting
the
notorious
despujol
i
thanked
him
and
suggested
that
if
we
should
be
fortunate
enough
to
identify
him
we
should
watch
for
the
keeping
of
the
appointment
at
the
hôtel
luxembourg
at
nîmes
on
the
following
monday
with
whom
is
he
keeping
the
appointment
asked
señor
andrade
that
i
will
disclose
later
was
my
reply
i
know
that
the
appointment
has
been
fixed
and
if
we
watch
we
shall
i
feel
assured
gain
some
knowledge
of
considerable
interest
as
you
wish
replied
the
chief
of
police
who
now
seemed
convinced
by
my
manner
that
i
was
in
possession
of
certain
actual
facts
you
will
meet
señor
rivero
eh
certainly
i
said
then
i
wish
the
pair
of
you
the
good
fortune
of
arresting
the
assassin
despujol
he
said
as
we
shook
hands
and
parted
i
drove
at
once
to
hambledon
hotel
where
i
found
that
he
had
just
retired
to
bed
as
he
stood
in
his
pyjamas
surprised
at
my
unexpected
visit
at
that
hour
i
told
him
what
i
had
arranged
then
i
will
remain
here
and
watch
de
gex
departure
he
said
yes
but
be
very
careful
of
yourself
i
urged
keep
your
revolver
handy
for
you
never
know
when
an
attack
may
be
made
upon
you
these
fellows
though
great
men
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
employ
desperate
characters
to
do
their
dirty
work
i
quite
alive
to
that
fact
hugh
replied
my
friend
but
we
give
up
till
we
punish
those
responsible
for
poor
miss
state
will
we
no
we
wo
i
declared
determinedly
of
course
we
may
be
on
a
wrong
scent
but
something
seems
to
tell
me
that
we
are
pretty
hot
on
the
trail
the
assassin
despujol
would
never
have
been
employed
by
them
if
they
did
not
hold
us
in
dread
your
journey
to
montauban
will
prove
whether
you
are
right
hugh
he
said
and
then
after
arranging
that
he
should
follow
suzor
should
de
gex
leave
without
him
and
that
he
should
at
once
wire
me
word
to
the
poste
restante
at
nîmes
i
left
and
returning
to
the
hotel
packed
my
and
later
met
the
but
famous
detective
the
latter
proved
an
amusing
companion
who
during
the
long
night
journey
to
the
mediterranean
recounted
to
me
many
of
his
interesting
experiences
his
french
was
better
than
his
english
so
we
conversed
in
the
former
tongue
there
was
no
sleeping
carriage
upon
the
train
therefore
after
my
companion
had
spoken
to
the
conductor
we
made
ourselves
as
comfortable
as
we
could
in
the
compartment
which
had
been
reserved
for
us
at
three
in
the
morning
with
true
spanish
forethought
he
produced
some
sandwiches
fresh
fruit
and
a
bottle
of
excellent
wine
upon
which
we
made
a
hearty
meal
after
which
we
dozed
in
our
corners
till
dawn
throughout
the
day
my
companion
who
was
quite
as
eager
as
myself
to
arrest
the
notorious
despujol
chatted
in
french
as
we
went
slowly
down
the
fertile
valley
of
the
ebro
and
suddenly
out
to
where
on
our
right
lay
the
broad
blue
sea
not
until
late
afternoon
did
we
arrive
at
barcelona
and
having
two
hours
to
wait
we
went
along
the
paseo
de
san
juan
to
the
francia
station
and
having
deposited
our
bags
there
strolled
along
to
the
plaza
de
cataluña
where
at
the
gay
maison
dorée
we
had
coffee
and
cigarettes
while
my
companion
read
the
and
i
watched
the
picturesque
crowd
about
us
rivero
knew
barcelona
well
so
after
we
had
finished
our
cigarettes
we
took
a
taxi
to
the
central
police
office
where
we
had
a
chat
with
the
chief
of
the
detective
department
a
short
stout
little
man
with
a
round
boyish
face
and
a
black
moustache
after
that
we
took
another
taxi
along
to
the
in
the
plaza
de
la
constitución
it
being
the
feast
of
george
the
patron
saint
of
catalonia
which
accounted
for
the
bustle
and
gaiety
of
the
city
then
after
an
interesting
we
returned
to
the
station
and
set
out
upon
our
slow
journey
through
the
rich
wine
lands
of
catalonia
with
their
quaint
mediæval
villages
and
towns
with
occasional
glimpses
of
sapphire
sea
and
passing
over
many
ravines
and
gullies
we
at
last
long
after
nightfall
entered
a
long
tunnel
at
the
end
of
which
was
the
station
of
the
french
frontier
the
usual
prying
douaniers
were
quickly
at
work
and
after
some
coffee
at
the
restaurant
baqué
which
is
so
well
known
to
travellers
to
southern
spain
we
the
train
for
narbonne
where
in
the
morning
we
changed
and
travelled
to
montauban
by
way
of
carcassonne
and
toulouse
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
on
arrival
at
our
destination
we
took
rooms
at
the
hôtel
du
midi
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
tarn
to
the
prosperous
pleasant
little
french
town
once
a
headquarter
of
the
inquisition
and
even
now
containing
in
its
museum
the
axe
and
many
instruments
of
torture
after
a
wash
and
a
meal
for
we
were
both
very
hungry
we
set
out
to
find
monsieur
charles
rabel
whose
address
was
rue
de
lalande
number
we
crossed
the
wonderful
old
brick
bridge
from
villebourbon
to
the
town
a
bridge
built
in
the
fourteenth
century
with
an
internal
passage
running
beneath
the
roadway
to
the
ancient
château
then
making
our
way
past
the
old
church
of
jacques
with
its
fine
gothic
octagonal
tower
and
passing
through
a
number
of
streets
we
found
ourselves
in
the
narrow
rue
de
lalande
just
as
we
entered
the
street
which
contained
a
number
of
small
shops
i
halted
he
must
not
see
me
i
exclaimed
i
quite
agree
replied
the
spanish
detective
there
is
a
little
café
over
there
go
in
and
wait
for
me
i
will
make
some
discreet
inquiries
concerning
this
monsieur
rabel
hence
we
parted
and
while
señor
rivero
sauntered
along
the
street
in
search
of
the
house
in
question
i
went
into
the
café
and
ordered
a
bock
full
of
anxiety
lest
after
all
this
man
rabel
should
be
a
respectable
citizen
i
waited
time
passed
slowly
half
an
hour
went
by
i
ordered
a
mazagran
and
sat
smoking
trying
to
suppress
my
eagerness
an
hour
elapsed
an
hour
and
a
half
two
hours
i
waited
yet
another
until
the
proprietor
of
the
café
began
to
look
askance
at
me
then
i
paid
and
rising
went
out
into
the
street
it
was
now
dark
there
was
no
sign
of
my
friend
the
spanish
police
agent
he
had
disappeared
i
stood
upon
the
pavement
full
of
anxiety
and
bewilderment
what
could
have
happened
to
him
chapter
the
twentieth
mademoiselle
jacquelot
i
returned
to
my
rather
room
at
the
hôtel
du
midi
which
overlooked
the
place
outside
the
station
in
the
suburb
across
the
river
and
sank
into
a
chair
to
reflect
the
concierge
a
lad
who
wore
the
concierge
cap
the
concierge
being
off
duty
at
his
evening
meal
informed
me
that
my
friend
had
not
returned
he
seemed
an
alert
french
lad
of
that
type
so
frequently
seen
in
continental
hotels
señor
rivero
had
disappeared
for
an
hour
i
waited
seated
alone
in
my
room
reflecting
deeply
my
sole
desire
and
fixed
object
was
to
solve
the
enigma
of
gabrielle
tennison
unfortunate
mental
state
and
to
bring
to
justice
those
unscrupulous
blackguards
responsible
for
it
as
i
sat
there
her
pale
beautiful
face
arose
before
me
the
wonderful
countenance
of
the
girl
who
had
in
such
a
strange
and
indescribable
manner
taken
possession
of
my
soul
to
analyse
my
feelings
towards
her
was
impossible
i
put
to
myself
the
query
why
i
loved
her
but
i
was
utterly
unable
to
answer
it
i
loved
her
most
passionately
and
devotedly
that
was
all
the
tragedy
of
the
situation
was
that
i
loved
one
who
alas
could
not
return
my
affection
as
a
girl
with
her
mental
balance
unaffected
could
do
her
poor
unbalanced
brain
could
never
allow
her
to
understand
me
or
to
return
my
love
i
was
tired
after
the
long
sleepless
journey
from
spain
and
i
suppose
i
must
have
dozed
in
my
chair
i
awoke
suddenly
hearing
a
tap
upon
the
door
and
an
elderly
chambermaid
entered
with
a
telegram
i
tore
it
open
and
found
it
had
been
dispatched
from
castelsarrasin
and
was
from
rivero
saying
absence
unavoidable
hope
to
be
back
by
midnight
where
is
castelsarrasin
i
inquired
of
the
woman
it
is
about
sixteen
kilomètres
from
here
replied
the
buxom
woman
in
the
strong
accent
of
toulouse
it
is
on
the
road
to
agen
and
the
railway
junction
for
just
a
small
town
they
say
that
the
name
is
a
corruption
of
at
least
my
mother
used
to
tell
me
so
what
i
wondered
had
taken
the
head
of
the
madrid
detective
force
out
there
he
must
be
following
some
fresh
clue
so
i
went
forth
across
the
bridge
to
a
big
café
opposite
the
theatre
and
there
idled
till
nearly
midnight
when
i
returned
eagerly
to
meet
my
friend
he
entered
my
room
just
before
one
in
the
morning
tired
and
dusty
for
he
appeared
to
have
walked
a
long
distance
i
had
some
cognac
and
a
syphon
of
seltzer
awaiting
him
and
sinking
exhausted
into
a
chair
he
took
a
long
and
refreshing
drink
before
he
spoke
well
he
said
with
a
sigh
you
have
been
wondering
why
i
disappeared
so
mysteriously
eh
the
fact
is
i
was
compelled
on
making
inquiry
of
a
shoemaker
who
has
a
little
shop
near
charles
rabel
house
i
learned
that
the
man
for
whom
we
are
searching
lived
in
a
flat
on
the
first
floor
of
the
house
kept
by
a
widow
named
cailliot
but
he
was
frequently
absent
in
england
or
in
italy
only
for
short
spells
was
he
there
for
he
was
a
commercial
traveller
representing
a
lyons
firm
of
silkweavers
as
we
were
speaking
the
shoemaker
pointed
to
a
rather
smart
young
woman
who
was
at
that
moment
leaving
the
house
and
said
that
is
mademoiselle
jacquelot
the
fiancée
of
monsieur
charles
she
might
tell
you
where
he
is
i
do
not
think
he
is
at
home
i
saw
him
four
days
ago
and
spoke
to
him
as
he
passed
but
i
believe
he
has
left
again
i
thanked
him
and
at
once
followed
mademoiselle
hence
i
had
no
time
to
tell
you
for
i
had
no
idea
where
she
was
going
i
saw
that
by
following
fiancée
i
might
gain
some
useful
knowledge
she
walked
to
the
station
and
took
a
ticket
for
castelsarrasin
i
did
the
same
we
had
half
an
hour
to
wait
but
i
spent
it
patiently
and
when
we
left
i
travelled
alone
with
her
in
the
same
compartment
soon
i
managed
to
get
into
conversation
with
her
whereupon
i
mentioned
that
i
had
a
friend
monsieur
charles
rabel
in
montauban
and
that
we
had
met
in
paris
he
had
once
shown
me
her
photograph
and
i
believed
i
was
not
mistaken
that
she
was
mademoiselle
jacquelot
at
first
she
was
surprised
but
i
told
her
a
very
plausible
story
whereupon
she
explained
that
charles
had
gone
to
toulouse
on
business
three
days
before
but
that
he
was
returning
at
noon
she
herself
lived
in
castelsarrasin
but
do
you
anticipate
that
we
shall
discover
in
charles
rabel
the
notorious
despujol
i
inquired
eagerly
rivero
raised
his
shoulders
and
elevated
his
black
eyebrows
saying
from
facts
i
gathered
from
mademoiselle
concerning
him
i
certainly
think
that
we
are
really
upon
his
track
it
hardly
seems
possible
but
we
must
remain
in
patience
till
then
if
we
find
our
surmise
correct
we
must
act
with
the
greatest
caution
if
we
are
to
watch
him
to
nîmes
where
he
is
to
meet
your
mysterious
friend
the
man
whose
name
you
refuse
to
reveal
when
they
meet
you
will
at
once
recognize
him
i
said
i
may
be
mistaken
i
added
but
i
do
not
anticipate
that
i
am
if
all
goes
well
then
you
will
arrest
the
notorious
despujol
i
only
wish
that
the
fellow
would
fall
into
my
hands
replied
my
companion
if
so
then
revelations
will
be
made
that
will
startle
europe
and
incidentally
gain
you
promotion
in
the
service
eh
i
laughed
he
nodded
and
admitted
i
hope
so
señor
garfield
i
sincerely
hope
so
he
replied
and
we
parted
for
the
night
next
day
i
woke
early
and
sought
my
friend
we
idled
about
till
nearly
noon
when
we
went
together
to
the
railway
station
to
watch
the
arrival
of
the
train
from
toulouse
a
number
of
people
were
about
for
the
dusty
lumbering
express
from
bordeaux
to
marseilles
had
at
that
moment
arrived
and
considerable
bustle
ensued
in
consequence
while
we
stood
watching
the
crowd
señor
rivero
suddenly
touched
my
arm
and
whispered
look
yonder
the
girl
in
dark
blue
that
is
mademoiselle
jacquelot
she
must
not
see
me
i
wonder
why
she
is
here
if
not
to
warn
him
of
the
inquiries
made
concerning
him
by
a
stranger
i
glanced
in
the
direction
he
had
indicated
and
saw
a
tall
slim
rather
girl
sauntering
idly
in
our
direction
her
attention
had
for
the
moment
been
diverted
by
an
advertisement
upon
the
wall
quick
cried
my
friend
let
us
slip
back
here
and
next
moment
we
had
repassed
the
barrier
back
into
the
if
she
sees
me
her
suspicions
will
be
aroused
if
they
are
not
already
aroused
said
my
companion
the
fact
that
she
is
here
gives
rise
to
the
question
whether
she
is
really
so
innocent
as
she
pretends
she
may
know
of
her
lover
escapades
and
suspects
me
of
having
followed
her
out
to
her
home
if
she
does
suspect
then
she
is
cleverer
than
you
anticipated
i
remarked
yes
but
in
any
case
we
had
better
act
independently
you
return
to
the
platform
for
she
has
never
seen
you
you
will
remain
well
concealed
and
watch
them
meet
while
i
shall
be
at
the
exit
to
identify
him
if
you
find
that
you
can
not
get
near
enough
to
him
without
courting
observation
as
he
spoke
the
bell
was
clanging
and
there
came
the
roar
of
the
engine
entering
the
big
echoing
station
i
slipped
back
instantly
upon
the
platform
and
standing
at
a
point
against
the
corner
of
the
bookstand
where
i
hoped
to
escape
unobserved
i
turned
my
head
away
as
the
train
came
along
then
when
it
drew
up
i
held
my
breath
anxiously
as
i
turned
around
the
girl
in
navy
blue
was
not
far
from
me
searching
along
the
train
until
of
a
sudden
she
espied
a
man
in
a
dark
overcoat
and
velour
hat
who
had
just
alighted
carrying
in
his
hand
a
small
leather
case
his
countenance
was
ruddy
and
he
had
a
small
black
moustache
my
heart
fell
the
man
was
a
stranger
to
me
the
countenance
was
not
that
of
the
man
whom
i
had
surprised
in
my
bedroom
at
madrid
he
bent
and
greeted
her
affectionately
but
next
moment
it
was
apparent
that
she
was
explaining
something
which
caused
his
countenance
to
grow
serious
he
put
one
or
two
swift
questions
to
her
then
halting
suddenly
he
glanced
at
his
watch
i
strove
to
get
sufficiently
near
to
look
well
into
his
face
but
i
feared
recognition
would
he
pass
out
of
the
exit
where
the
famous
spanish
detective
was
awaiting
him
rivero
knew
despujol
by
photographs
and
indeed
had
been
present
when
he
had
been
convicted
on
the
last
occasion
a
few
years
before
mademoiselle
friend
hesitated
for
some
moments
and
then
accosting
a
porter
asked
a
question
the
man
pointed
to
a
train
on
the
opposite
platform
was
it
possible
that
what
mademoiselle
had
told
him
had
scared
him
it
seemed
so
for
with
a
sudden
resolve
instead
of
walking
to
the
exit
he
entered
the
and
bought
another
ticket
in
an
instant
i
dashed
to
the
exit
where
the
spaniard
was
waiting
and
in
a
few
breathless
words
told
him
of
the
man
intention
to
my
amazement
señor
rivero
heard
me
unmoved
i
was
awaiting
you
he
said
the
man
you
have
been
watching
is
not
despujol
at
all
despujol
whom
i
recognized
passed
out
a
few
moments
ago
and
took
a
cab
to
his
house
in
the
rue
de
lalande
then
you
have
seen
him
i
gasped
yes
it
is
rodriquez
despujol
without
a
doubt
monsieur
garfield
you
have
not
been
mistaken
and
we
must
certainly
thank
you
for
putting
us
upon
the
track
of
this
dangerous
assassin
then
after
all
my
surmise
is
correct
and
he
will
go
on
monday
to
meet
his
paymaster
in
nîmes
i
said
the
plot
against
me
failed
probably
a
second
attempt
is
to
be
made
we
shall
be
careful
not
to
be
seen
until
he
travels
to
nîmes
laughed
rivero
well
satisfied
at
the
progress
he
had
made
but
i
wonder
who
is
the
man
whom
mademoiselle
has
met
i
remarked
she
has
evidently
warned
him
of
some
danger
if
that
so
we
ought
to
see
him
my
friend
exclaimed
let
us
go
together
on
to
the
platform
and
watch
so
long
as
mademoiselle
does
not
recognize
me
we
are
safe
with
the
reassuring
knowledge
that
the
man
who
was
being
sought
for
by
the
whole
police
of
europe
had
gone
to
his
unsuspicious
abode
in
the
rue
de
lalande
we
returned
to
the
far
platform
where
a
train
stood
waiting
to
leave
it
was
the
for
paris
by
way
of
bourges
the
man
was
already
in
a
compartment
and
as
he
stood
with
his
head
out
of
the
window
mademoiselle
was
chatting
with
him
truly
his
stay
in
montauban
had
not
been
long
the
instant
rivero
caught
sight
of
the
fellow
face
he
exclaimed
holy
madonna
why
it
is
mateo
sanz
the
we
been
searching
everywhere
for
him
he
shot
and
killed
a
carabineer
near
malaga
a
month
ago
next
second
he
had
left
me
and
a
few
moments
later
hurried
back
he
had
bought
a
ticket
sanz
does
not
know
me
as
soon
as
we
left
the
station
and
are
away
from
mademoiselle
i
shall
be
all
right
remain
here
i
will
wire
you
and
in
any
case
we
shall
be
together
in
nîmes
on
monday
but
be
careful
not
to
be
seen
by
despujol
he
is
a
wary
bird
remember
then
unseen
by
mademoiselle
he
entered
a
compartment
of
the
train
just
as
the
signal
was
given
to
start
the
train
moved
off
and
i
was
left
alone
surely
much
had
happened
in
those
few
exciting
moments
but
why
had
mademoiselle
jacquelot
warned
her
friend
the
if
she
had
warned
him
because
of
rivero
inquiries
concerning
despujol
then
she
could
also
warn
the
latter
again
it
was
curious
that
she
met
sanz
and
did
not
meet
despujol
further
it
was
a
strange
fact
that
the
pair
of
spanish
criminals
had
not
travelled
together
unless
there
was
some
reason
for
it
perhaps
there
was
i
watched
mademoiselle
as
she
passed
out
of
the
station
to
a
little
restaurant
where
she
had
a
frugal
meal
then
she
returned
and
took
a
ticket
back
to
her
home
in
castelsarrasin
rivero
now
had
his
hands
full
not
only
had
he
identified
in
the
respectable
commercial
traveller
charles
rabel
the
notorious
assassin
despujol
but
he
had
also
quite
accidentally
come
across
sanz
the
who
of
late
had
terrorized
the
south
of
spain
and
whose
daring
depredations
were
upon
everyone
lips
mademoiselle
seemed
to
be
a
friend
of
both
men
i
returned
to
my
hotel
close
by
and
ate
my
alone
my
position
was
a
very
unenviable
one
for
i
feared
to
go
over
into
the
town
lest
i
should
come
face
to
face
with
the
man
who
had
so
cunningly
made
an
attempt
upon
me
as
the
hireling
of
oswald
de
gex
but
my
thoughts
were
ever
of
my
beloved
the
girl
who
was
the
victim
of
some
foul
plot
into
which
i
too
had
been
drawn
a
mystery
which
i
was
devoting
my
whole
life
to
solve
at
five
that
evening
i
received
a
telegram
from
harry
in
madrid
telling
me
that
all
was
quiet
and
our
friend
meaning
de
gex
never
went
out
to
this
i
replied
in
a
cryptic
way
that
our
suspicions
had
been
verified
and
that
the
person
of
whom
we
were
in
search
we
had
discovered
we
were
only
now
waiting
for
the
appointment
to
be
kept
at
the
hôtel
de
luxembourg
at
nîmes
next
day
passed
uneventfully
in
order
to
kill
time
i
took
train
to
the
quaint
little
town
of
moissac
an
ancient
little
place
on
the
tarn
about
kilomètres
distant
and
there
spent
the
hours
wandering
about
the
countryside
which
is
so
famed
for
its
grapes
in
autumn
i
did
not
return
to
montauban
till
after
seven
and
while
i
sat
at
dinner
the
waiter
handed
me
another
telegram
it
was
from
rivero
and
having
been
sent
from
lyons
read
all
well
just
returning
to
montauban
later
i
busied
myself
with
and
found
that
he
would
be
due
to
arrive
about
six
on
the
following
morning
therefore
i
possessed
myself
in
patience
and
i
was
still
in
bed
when
in
the
morning
he
entered
my
room
well
he
exclaimed
in
french
as
he
sank
wearily
into
a
chair
had
a
swift
and
weary
journey
sanz
has
been
alarmed
by
the
girl
why
i
can
not
tell
did
she
go
to
see
despujol
no
i
replied
she
did
see
him
but
went
straight
home
you
have
not
ventured
near
despujol
i
hope
no
i
have
hardly
ventured
into
the
town
good
well
we
shall
make
a
double
arrest
he
went
on
when
the
train
arrived
at
the
junction
at
montlucon
at
midnight
sanz
evidently
fearing
lest
he
was
followed
slipped
out
of
the
train
and
into
another
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
platform
it
is
a
favourite
dodge
of
elusive
persons
of
his
type
so
unseen
by
him
i
also
joined
the
train
and
we
travelled
across
to
lyons
there
he
went
to
a
house
in
the
rue
chevreuil
close
to
the
river
and
when
i
had
him
safely
there
i
went
to
the
bureau
of
police
and
asked
that
observation
should
be
kept
upon
him
until
such
time
that
we
in
spain
should
demand
his
arrest
and
extradition
the
lyons
police
know
me
very
well
so
two
agents
were
at
once
detailed
for
that
duty
and
i
immediately
made
my
way
back
here
it
seems
that
sanz
is
also
wanted
in
france
for
a
exploit
outside
orleans
therefore
our
discovery
is
indeed
a
lucky
one
will
sanz
be
arrested
i
asked
yes
i
have
already
reported
by
telegram
to
señor
andrade
in
madrid
he
will
at
once
ask
them
in
paris
to
order
the
arrest
and
despujol
we
have
now
to
await
his
journey
to
nîmes
to
keep
this
mysterious
appointment
with
your
friend
not
my
friend
i
remarked
rather
with
my
bitterest
enemy
chapter
the
at
the
hôtel
luxembourg
as
a
detective
rivero
was
of
outstanding
shrewdness
he
knew
that
more
could
be
gained
by
patience
than
by
sharp
activity
hence
he
did
not
go
near
the
rue
de
lalande
indeed
on
the
saturday
night
we
both
left
montauban
together
and
travelled
by
that
slow
route
through
the
aveyron
by
way
of
sévérac
down
to
the
ancient
city
of
nîmes
that
quaint
quiet
old
place
which
contains
more
monuments
of
antiquity
than
any
other
town
in
france
early
in
the
morning
we
alighted
at
the
station
high
upon
a
viaduct
after
a
sleepless
night
and
drove
to
a
small
commercial
hotel
the
cheval
blanc
in
the
place
des
arènes
nearly
opposite
the
luxembourg
where
the
of
europe
had
appointed
to
meet
the
infamous
despujol
when
i
inquired
for
a
telegram
one
was
handed
to
me
it
was
from
hambledon
saying
that
de
gex
had
left
for
nîmes
and
suzor
was
returning
to
paris
therefore
he
would
follow
the
latter
having
installed
ourselves
in
the
hotel
rivero
went
to
the
concierge
and
taking
him
into
his
confidence
over
a
note
told
him
that
he
was
very
anxious
to
know
whether
a
gentleman
named
rabel
had
arrived
at
the
luxembourg
would
he
ask
the
concierge
there
privately
on
the
telephone
the
man
in
uniform
at
once
rang
up
the
luxembourg
and
addressing
the
concierge
as
his
dear
henri
made
the
inquiry
the
reply
was
that
monsieur
rabel
was
expected
at
noon
ask
if
a
gentleman
is
expected
who
has
engaged
a
private
rivero
said
the
reply
came
back
that
a
gentleman
believed
to
be
english
had
arrived
in
the
night
and
now
occupied
the
best
suite
his
name
was
monsieur
johnson
of
london
i
then
described
de
gex
to
the
concierge
who
repeated
the
description
to
the
other
hotel
yes
he
said
turning
again
to
me
henri
believes
it
is
the
same
gentleman
whom
you
describe
who
is
he
asked
rivero
much
puzzled
wait
and
you
will
see
i
replied
laughing
for
we
now
seemed
to
be
within
an
ace
of
success
just
before
midday
we
watched
the
arrival
of
the
train
from
montauban
and
from
it
there
descended
the
man
we
expected
the
notorious
despujol
though
his
features
were
unmistakable
he
was
made
up
to
look
much
older
his
hair
being
made
grey
above
the
ears
at
his
side
there
walked
a
man
whom
i
instantly
recognized
and
sight
of
him
i
must
confess
caused
me
to
hold
my
breath
it
was
the
italian
doctor
moroni
we
drew
back
and
hastening
to
a
taxi
returned
at
once
to
our
hotel
from
the
door
of
which
we
could
see
the
entrance
to
the
luxembourg
where
a
few
moments
later
we
saw
both
the
travellers
enter
what
further
devil
work
was
now
in
progress
we
watched
the
hotel
in
patience
until
just
before
three
the
trio
came
forth
laughing
airily
why
look
gasped
rivero
despujol
is
with
your
great
english
financier
señor
de
gex
i
smiled
triumphantly
i
told
you
that
i
had
a
surprise
in
store
for
you
i
exclaimed
but
if
despujol
is
with
him
it
must
be
with
some
evil
intent
that
is
certain
while
señor
de
gex
was
in
madrid
we
had
orders
to
afford
him
police
protection
rivero
said
possibly
he
suspected
that
some
attempt
might
be
made
upon
him
certainly
he
has
no
idea
of
that
man
true
identity
yes
he
has
for
he
has
come
here
specially
to
meet
him
in
secret
but
why
that
italian
should
be
here
i
can
only
surmise
he
is
a
doctor
from
florence
named
moroni
a
man
of
very
evil
repute
but
why
should
señor
de
gex
meet
such
people
in
secret
asked
rivero
much
astonished
i
suppose
there
is
some
strong
motive
why
they
should
meet
the
more
so
now
that
i
have
proved
to
you
that
the
notorious
despujol
is
a
hireling
of
this
wealthy
man
de
gex
a
hireling
he
gasped
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
de
gex
hired
despujol
to
make
that
attempt
upon
my
life
and
i
have
a
suspicion
one
not
yet
entirely
verified
that
moroni
prepared
that
deadly
orosin
by
the
agency
of
which
it
was
hoped
that
i
should
meet
with
my
death
do
you
really
suggest
that
de
gex
one
of
the
and
most
philanthropic
men
in
europe
actually
hired
despujol
to
go
to
your
room
that
night
my
companion
asked
his
eyes
following
the
trio
as
they
walked
together
and
chatted
beneath
the
trees
of
the
avenue
feuchères
i
do
and
further
de
gex
has
every
motive
in
closing
my
lips
ah
then
you
hold
some
secret
of
his
perhaps
asked
rivero
a
new
interest
being
instantly
aroused
i
do
one
that
i
intend
to
expose
when
i
obtain
sufficient
corroborative
evidence
i
answered
with
determination
but
is
not
the
fact
of
the
three
men
meeting
here
in
secret
under
assumed
names
sufficient
proof
to
you
that
some
fresh
plot
is
afoot
certainly
it
is
rivero
agreed
but
i
wish
you
would
reveal
to
me
the
whole
facts
it
is
unnecessary
was
my
reply
you
are
here
only
to
deal
with
despujol
i
promised
i
would
bring
you
to
him
and
i
have
done
so
instead
of
living
in
obscurity
in
a
frontier
village
in
the
pyrenees
as
you
in
madrid
believed
i
have
shown
you
that
he
lives
in
montauban
where
he
passes
as
an
industrious
commercial
traveller
if
you
search
that
house
in
the
rue
de
lalande
you
might
find
a
quantity
of
stolen
property
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
has
already
been
searched
by
the
police
of
montauban
at
my
request
he
replied
the
raid
was
made
last
night
after
charles
rabel
had
left
i
received
a
telegram
from
the
commissary
of
police
only
an
hour
ago
to
the
effect
that
six
heavy
cases
of
samples
had
been
opened
and
in
them
was
found
a
great
quantity
of
stolen
jewellery
negotiable
securities
and
other
objects
of
value
including
two
valuable
paintings
which
were
missing
from
the
prado
museum
three
years
ago
then
my
information
has
been
of
some
little
use
to
you
eh
of
enormous
use
señor
garfield
you
will
no
doubt
receive
an
official
letter
of
thanks
from
the
ministry
of
the
interior
he
replied
but
we
must
act
very
warily
despujol
will
not
risk
remaining
here
for
long
besides
some
friend
may
telegraph
to
him
that
the
police
have
been
to
the
rue
de
lalande
once
more
it
was
upon
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
explain
the
manner
in
which
i
had
become
implicated
in
the
evil
deeds
of
oswald
de
gex
and
his
sycophants
when
of
a
sudden
he
added
you
must
really
forgive
me
señor
garfield
but
you
are
an
entire
mystery
to
me
you
have
never
been
frank
with
me
never
once
i
have
been
as
frank
as
i
dared
i
replied
i
tell
you
that
i
am
here
to
watch
and
to
strive
to
elucidate
a
great
plot
one
which
concerns
myself
and
the
woman
i
love
we
have
both
been
victims
of
a
vile
and
desperate
conspiracy
and
whom
do
you
suspect
oswald
de
gex
with
what
motive
he
asked
for
he
held
the
enormously
wealthy
financial
friend
of
spain
in
awe
and
admiration
that
alas
is
an
enigma
to
me
i
only
know
that
he
has
made
an
attempt
upon
my
life
and
that
at
least
one
woman
has
been
sent
to
the
grave
by
foul
means
do
you
really
infer
that
señor
de
gex
is
an
assassin
he
asked
incredulously
i
only
tell
you
what
i
know
señor
rivero
i
replied
quietly
i
said
that
i
would
lead
you
to
the
secret
abode
of
despujol
and
i
think
i
have
now
fulfilled
my
promise
and
shown
you
that
he
is
on
friendly
terms
with
the
great
financier
whom
you
in
spain
all
hold
in
such
high
esteem
there
is
certainly
no
man
more
welcome
in
madrid
than
señor
de
gex
replied
the
police
official
at
the
ritz
whether
in
his
own
name
or
incognito
he
constantly
receives
our
greatest
politicians
and
most
prominent
personages
even
the
king
has
more
than
once
commanded
him
to
the
palace
in
order
to
confer
with
him
upon
acute
financial
problems
in
the
interests
of
our
country
and
yet
you
infer
that
señor
de
gex
is
an
assassin
i
not
only
infer
it
i
said
but
i
openly
allege
it
i
added
hotly
as
i
thought
of
gabrielle
rivero
glancing
at
me
quickly
raised
his
shoulders
with
a
gesture
of
disbelief
very
well
i
said
at
least
i
have
proved
to
you
that
he
is
a
secret
friend
of
the
notorious
despujol
why
is
he
here
in
nîmes
to
consult
with
de
gex
and
his
friend
the
italian
moroni
if
not
for
purposes
of
evil
despujol
has
made
desperate
war
upon
society
and
it
is
de
gex
who
secretly
finances
him
hence
he
is
the
servant
of
the
man
with
money
the
spaniard
reflected
well
he
exclaimed
at
last
what
you
have
revealed
is
certainly
most
interesting
and
if
you
wish
to
capture
despujol
you
must
lose
no
time
i
assured
him
remember
he
and
his
gang
have
agents
everywhere
with
eyes
and
ears
open
he
will
soon
know
of
the
raid
upon
his
retreat
in
montauban
no
doubt
he
will
agreed
my
companion
they
will
return
presently
and
then
we
will
arrest
him
in
the
meantime
i
will
call
upon
the
commissary
of
police
come
with
me
we
at
once
took
a
cab
to
the
prefecture
where
we
were
ushered
into
the
presence
of
monsieur
coulagne
a
rather
tall
elegant
man
with
the
rosette
of
the
legion
of
honour
in
his
coat
when
rivero
introduced
himself
the
commissary
bowed
to
us
both
and
bade
us
be
seated
in
a
few
quick
sentences
the
spanish
detective
explained
the
object
of
his
mission
and
producing
his
authority
from
the
spanish
ministry
requested
the
arrest
of
the
infamous
bandit
despujol
but
is
despujol
actually
in
nîmes
cried
the
commissary
astounded
he
certainly
is
i
identified
him
on
his
arrival
here
at
midday
we
have
been
searching
for
him
for
over
two
years
he
is
wanted
among
other
things
for
the
murder
of
madame
lescot
a
wealthy
widow
of
ah
then
it
is
not
a
matter
for
extradition
eh
remarked
rivero
we
want
him
for
a
dozen
crimes
of
violence
in
spain
he
attempted
the
death
of
my
english
companion
here
monsieur
garfield
who
will
give
evidence
against
him
the
commissary
pressed
an
electric
button
whereupon
his
secretary
appeared
in
a
few
rapid
sentences
the
tall
elegant
french
official
gave
orders
and
the
secretary
retired
at
once
to
execute
them
despujol
is
a
desperate
character
he
is
always
armed
and
possesses
abnormal
strength
he
could
strangle
his
strongest
opponent
rivero
remarked
i
have
taken
precautions
replied
monsieur
coulagne
smiling
i
have
ordered
ten
men
in
plain
clothes
to
go
at
once
unobtrusively
to
the
hôtel
du
luxembourg
and
arrest
him
when
he
returns
that
will
frighten
de
gex
and
moroni
i
said
quickly
and
if
they
are
frightened
they
will
escape
rivero
laughed
i
knew
that
he
entirely
disbelieved
my
statement
in
his
eyes
the
wealthy
friend
of
spain
could
do
no
wrong
did
not
his
king
invite
him
to
conference
in
ignorance
of
course
of
his
true
character
i
was
not
surprised
at
rivero
attitude
yet
i
had
hoped
that
despujol
arrest
would
be
effected
without
the
knowledge
of
de
gex
and
his
sinister
medical
friend
i
pointed
this
out
whereupon
rivero
remarked
with
sarcasm
if
what
you
allege
against
señor
de
gex
and
his
friend
be
true
they
ought
also
to
be
arrested
yes
they
ought
and
they
will
be
when
i
am
able
to
bring
forward
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
them
i
replied
warmly
why
i
ask
you
should
oswald
de
gex
be
in
secret
association
with
that
dangerous
bandit
the
spaniard
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
while
at
the
request
a
dossier
was
brought
in
and
then
they
both
went
through
a
long
catalogue
of
crimes
alleged
to
have
been
instigated
or
actually
committed
by
the
man
whom
i
had
found
in
my
bedroom
and
who
had
so
cleverly
deceived
me
the
list
was
a
formidable
one
and
showed
how
elusive
was
the
man
whom
the
police
of
europe
had
been
hunting
for
so
long
among
the
big
batch
of
papers
was
a
report
in
english
from
the
metropolitan
police
at
scotland
yard
stating
that
the
individual
in
question
had
arrived
in
london
on
a
certain
date
and
stayed
with
a
respectable
family
at
ham
near
richmond
representing
himself
to
be
a
lawyer
from
barcelona
thence
he
had
gone
to
glasgow
where
he
stayed
at
a
certain
hotel
and
then
moved
to
oban
afterwards
he
had
come
south
again
to
luton
in
bedfordshire
where
all
trace
of
him
had
been
lost
well
laughed
rivero
triumphantly
we
shall
take
good
care
not
to
lose
him
now
no
said
the
commissary
of
police
my
men
will
be
armed
and
will
take
him
alive
or
dead
and
de
gex
and
moroni
will
then
instantly
flee
i
said
full
of
regret
that
i
had
taken
that
step
which
might
so
easily
result
in
destroying
all
my
chances
of
solving
that
puzzling
enigma
of
gabrielle
tennison
nevertheless
it
was
a
source
of
satisfaction
that
at
last
despujol
had
by
my
watchfulness
been
run
to
earth
suddenly
the
telephone
at
monsieur
coulagne
elbow
rang
and
after
listening
he
exclaimed
the
men
are
already
posted
round
the
hotel
so
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
await
his
return
hence
i
went
forth
with
rivero
and
the
commissary
led
by
the
latter
we
approached
the
place
de
through
a
labyrinth
of
narrow
back
streets
until
on
gaining
the
hotel
we
saw
idling
in
the
vicinity
a
number
of
men
who
were
apparently
quite
disinterested
we
entered
the
hotel
boldly
and
drawing
back
to
the
end
of
the
lounge
after
a
whispered
word
with
the
concierge
we
waited
for
a
full
hour
we
remained
there
in
eager
impatience
until
suddenly
a
figure
whom
i
recognized
as
doctor
moroni
showed
in
the
doorway
he
was
alone
he
ascended
to
his
room
where
he
remained
for
about
ten
minutes
then
descending
he
went
to
the
bureau
and
inquired
for
the
bill
of
his
friend
and
himself
announcing
his
intention
of
departing
for
paris
by
the
train
which
left
in
half
an
hour
rivero
who
had
been
standing
near
him
unrecognized
crossed
quickly
to
where
with
the
commissary
i
sat
well
back
from
observation
and
gasped
they
gone
he
is
also
leaving
evidently
they
suspected
they
were
under
observation
ah
despujol
is
a
very
wary
bird
replied
monsieur
coulagne
rising
and
walking
out
into
the
place
where
he
whispered
some
hurried
words
to
a
stout
man
who
was
sauntering
by
and
who
was
his
chief
inspector
in
a
few
moments
more
than
half
the
lurking
police
agents
had
disappeared
to
make
inquiries
at
the
railway
station
and
in
various
quarters
and
when
he
rejoined
us
moroni
having
returned
upstairs
he
said
despujol
can
not
yet
have
gone
very
far
i
have
given
orders
for
all
railway
stations
within
two
hundred
kilomètres
to
be
warned
let
us
return
to
my
bureau
and
await
reports
and
what
about
moroni
i
asked
he
will
be
followed
i
have
already
seen
to
that
was
the
reply
back
at
the
prefecture
monsieur
coulagne
was
soon
speaking
rapidly
over
the
telephone
then
we
waited
for
news
of
the
fugitive
none
came
until
about
two
hours
afterwards
the
result
of
inquiries
was
told
to
us
by
an
inspector
it
seemed
that
on
the
previous
day
a
large
open
car
driven
by
a
chauffeur
put
into
carli
garage
a
big
establishment
in
the
boulevard
des
arènes
the
chauffeur
asked
for
a
receipt
for
the
car
saying
that
he
had
to
go
by
train
to
marseilles
and
that
his
master
would
probably
call
for
the
car
on
the
following
day
and
produce
the
receipt
he
asked
that
it
should
be
filled
up
with
petrol
in
readiness
for
his
master
about
two
hours
before
the
police
made
inquiry
three
gentlemen
entered
the
garage
the
descriptions
of
whom
tallied
with
those
of
de
gex
despujol
and
moroni
de
gex
produced
the
receipt
for
the
car
he
paid
for
the
petrol
and
he
and
despujol
drove
away
bidding
farewell
to
moroni
despujol
drove
the
car
ah
exclaimed
rivero
despujol
would
not
risk
the
train
he
always
arranges
a
secret
means
of
escape
in
this
case
he
prepared
it
on
the
day
before
without
a
doubt
he
knew
that
watch
was
being
kept
or
was
it
that
de
gex
knew
that
i
was
here
i
suggested
well
in
any
case
remarked
the
commissary
of
police
the
pair
have
got
clear
away
and
though
we
will
do
our
best
it
will
no
doubt
be
extremely
difficult
to
rediscover
them
they
will
change
the
on
the
car
and
perhaps
repaint
it
who
knows
despujol
is
one
of
the
most
desperate
characters
in
all
europe
and
oswald
de
gex
is
equally
dangerous
i
declared
for
i
was
still
no
nearer
the
truth
chapter
the
gabrielle
at
home
i
had
been
back
in
london
a
little
over
a
week
when
i
read
in
the
paper
one
morning
a
paragraph
which
possessed
for
me
a
peculiar
interest
it
ran
as
follows
the
notorious
spanish
bandit
rodriquez
despujol
who
has
for
several
years
terrorized
murcia
and
andalusia
and
has
committed
several
murders
is
dead
the
police
have
been
searching
for
him
everywhere
but
so
elusive
was
he
that
he
always
evaded
them
the
celebrated
spanish
detective
señor
rivero
learnt
a
short
time
ago
that
the
wanted
man
had
been
seen
at
nîmes
where
he
cleverly
contrived
to
escape
by
car
certain
clues
came
into
the
hands
of
the
police
and
by
these
señor
rivero
was
able
to
trace
the
fugitive
to
denia
not
far
from
valencia
he
was
hiding
in
a
small
cottage
in
an
just
outside
the
town
the
place
was
surrounded
by
police
but
despujol
discovering
this
opened
fire
upon
them
from
one
of
the
windows
and
also
threw
a
hand
grenade
among
them
with
result
that
two
carabineers
were
killed
and
four
others
injured
among
the
latter
being
señor
rivero
himself
a
desperate
fight
ensued
but
in
the
end
the
bandit
received
a
bullet
in
the
head
which
proved
fatal
a
large
quantity
of
stolen
property
of
all
sorts
has
been
discovered
in
rooms
which
the
criminal
occupied
in
montauban
in
france
despujol
latest
exploit
was
an
attempt
to
administer
in
secret
a
very
deadly
poison
to
an
englishman
who
was
visiting
madrid
it
was
that
attempted
crime
which
aroused
señor
rivero
activities
which
have
had
the
effect
of
ridding
spain
of
one
of
its
most
notorious
assassins
i
read
the
report
twice
so
the
defiant
despujol
was
dead
and
poor
rivero
had
sustained
injuries
nothing
was
said
of
the
powerful
financier
friendship
with
the
bandit
when
i
showed
it
to
hambledon
he
remarked
at
least
you
been
the
means
not
only
of
putting
an
end
to
despujol
ignoble
career
but
also
of
restoring
a
quantity
of
very
valuable
property
to
its
owners
true
but
it
brings
us
no
nearer
a
solution
of
the
affair
at
stretton
street
was
my
reply
gabrielle
mother
had
returned
to
london
and
that
evening
i
called
upon
her
by
appointment
i
found
her
a
refined
woman
with
a
pale
anxious
face
and
eyes
when
i
mentioned
gabrielle
who
was
in
the
adjoining
room
she
sighed
and
exclaimed
ah
garfield
it
is
a
great
trial
to
me
poor
child
i
can
not
think
what
happened
to
her
nobody
can
tell
she
least
of
all
doctor
moroni
has
been
very
good
for
he
is
greatly
interested
in
her
case
they
have
told
me
that
you
called
some
time
ago
and
evinced
an
interest
in
her
yes
tennison
i
said
i
feel
a
very
deep
interest
in
your
daughter
because
well
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
too
after
a
strange
adventure
here
in
london
one
night
completely
lost
my
sense
of
identity
and
when
i
came
to
a
knowledge
of
things
about
me
i
was
in
a
hospital
in
france
having
been
found
unconscious
at
the
roadside
many
days
after
my
adventure
in
london
how
very
curious
tennison
remarked
instantly
interested
gabrielle
was
found
at
the
roadside
do
you
think
then
that
there
is
any
connexion
between
your
case
and
hers
yes
tennison
i
replied
promptly
it
is
for
that
reason
i
am
in
active
search
of
the
truth
in
the
interests
of
your
daughter
as
well
as
of
those
of
my
own
what
do
you
suspect
mr
garfield
asked
gabrielle
mother
as
we
sat
in
that
little
room
where
on
the
table
in
the
centre
stood
an
old
filled
with
la
france
roses
i
suspect
many
things
in
some
my
suspicions
have
proved
correct
in
others
i
am
still
entirely
in
the
dark
one
important
point
however
i
have
established
namely
the
means
by
which
this
curious
mysterious
effect
has
been
produced
upon
the
minds
of
both
your
daughter
and
myself
when
one
knows
the
disease
then
it
is
not
difficult
to
search
for
the
cure
i
know
how
the
effect
was
produced
and
further
i
know
the
name
of
the
medical
man
who
has
effected
cures
in
similar
cases
you
do
she
exclaimed
eagerly
well
gabrielle
has
seen
a
dozen
specialists
all
of
whom
have
been
puzzled
professor
gourbeil
of
lyons
has
been
able
to
gain
complete
cures
in
two
cases
orosin
a
newly
discovered
poison
is
the
drug
that
was
used
and
the
professor
has
a
wider
knowledge
of
the
effect
of
that
highly
dangerous
substance
than
any
person
living
you
should
arrange
to
take
your
daughter
to
him
the
widow
shook
her
head
and
in
a
mournful
tone
replied
ah
i
am
afraid
it
would
be
useless
doctor
moroni
took
her
to
several
specialists
but
they
all
failed
to
restore
her
brain
to
its
normal
activity
professor
gourbeil
is
the
only
man
who
has
ever
been
able
to
completely
cure
a
person
to
whom
orosin
has
been
administered
and
that
has
been
in
two
cases
only
so
the
chance
is
very
remote
even
if
she
saw
him
exclaimed
the
widow
despairingly
i
think
tennison
that
gabrielle
should
see
him
in
any
case
i
said
i
agree
the
poor
girl
condition
is
most
pitiable
at
times
she
seems
absolutely
normal
and
talks
of
things
about
her
in
quite
a
reasonable
manner
but
she
never
seems
able
to
concentrate
her
thoughts
they
always
wander
swiftly
from
one
subject
to
another
i
have
noticed
too
that
her
vision
is
affected
sometimes
she
will
declare
that
a
vivid
red
is
blue
when
we
look
into
shop
windows
together
she
will
refer
to
a
yellow
dress
as
mauve
a
pink
as
white
at
times
she
can
not
distinguish
colours
yet
now
and
then
her
vision
becomes
quite
normal
i
have
had
some
difficulty
tennison
in
that
way
myself
i
said
when
i
first
left
malo
after
recovering
consciousness
of
the
present
i
one
day
saw
a
grass
field
and
it
appeared
to
be
bright
blue
again
an
omnibus
in
london
which
i
knew
to
be
blue
was
a
peculiar
dull
red
so
my
symptoms
were
the
same
as
your
daughter
it
seems
proved
that
both
of
you
are
of
some
desperate
plot
garfield
said
the
widow
but
what
could
have
been
its
motive
that
i
am
striving
with
all
my
might
to
establish
i
answered
if
i
can
only
obtain
from
your
daughter
the
true
facts
concerning
her
adventures
on
that
fatal
night
last
november
then
it
will
materially
assist
me
towards
fixing
the
guilt
upon
the
person
i
suspect
in
this
i
beg
your
aid
tennison
i
said
i
have
only
just
returned
from
several
weeks
abroad
during
which
i
have
gained
considerable
knowledge
which
in
the
end
will
i
hope
lead
me
to
the
solution
of
the
problem
i
then
told
her
of
my
journey
to
spain
and
afterwards
to
nîmes
but
i
mentioned
nothing
concerning
either
oswald
de
gex
or
despujol
at
that
moment
gabrielle
unaware
of
my
presence
entered
she
was
dressed
in
a
simple
grey
frock
with
short
sleeves
and
cut
discreetly
low
and
looked
very
sweet
on
seeing
me
she
drew
back
but
next
second
she
put
out
her
slim
white
hand
in
greeting
and
with
a
delightful
smile
exclaimed
why
why
garfield
i
i
remember
you
you
called
upon
me
some
weeks
ago
did
you
not
yes
miss
tennison
i
did
i
replied
as
i
sprang
from
my
chair
and
bent
over
her
hand
so
you
recollect
me
eh
i
do
they
said
that
you
would
call
upon
me
she
replied
her
beautiful
face
suddenly
clouding
who
told
you
that
i
asked
doctor
moroni
he
warned
me
that
you
were
my
enemy
i
drew
a
long
breath
for
i
discerned
the
depth
of
the
plot
not
your
enemy
miss
tennison
i
assured
her
but
your
friend
your
friend
who
is
trying
his
best
to
solve
the
problem
of
your
your
illness
yes
gabrielle
dear
garfield
is
certainly
your
friend
i
know
that
declared
her
mother
kindly
doctor
moroni
must
have
been
mistaken
why
should
he
have
warned
you
against
meeting
mr
garfield
i
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
i
said
of
course
tennison
you
have
no
previous
knowledge
of
me
you
are
taking
me
entirely
at
my
own
estimation
when
i
meet
a
young
man
who
is
open
and
frank
as
you
are
i
trust
him
she
said
quietly
you
know
that
woman
intuition
seldom
errs
i
laughed
well
i
answered
i
am
striving
to
solve
the
mystery
of
what
occurred
on
the
night
of
november
the
seventh
of
what
occurred
to
your
daughter
as
well
as
to
myself
tennison
endeavoured
to
obtain
from
me
a
description
of
my
adventure
but
i
managed
to
evade
her
questions
i
wonder
why
doctor
moroni
warned
gabrielle
against
you
she
remarked
presently
it
is
a
mystery
yes
tennison
it
is
all
a
mystery
a
complete
mystery
to
me
why
doctor
moroni
of
all
men
should
take
an
interest
in
your
daughter
he
is
certainly
not
a
man
to
be
trusted
and
i
in
turn
warn
you
against
him
why
he
has
been
so
good
to
gabrielle
the
reason
of
my
warning
is
that
he
is
her
enemy
as
well
as
mine
i
said
glancing
at
the
beautiful
girl
whose
countenance
had
alas
now
grown
inanimate
again
but
i
do
not
understand
tennison
exclaimed
why
should
the
doctor
be
gabrielle
enemy
ah
that
i
can
not
tell
except
that
he
fears
lest
she
should
recover
and
reveal
the
truth
a
serious
truth
which
would
implicate
him
do
you
think
he
had
any
hand
in
the
mysterious
affair
i
certainly
do
was
my
reply
and
then
i
told
her
of
my
journey
to
italy
and
of
my
discovery
of
her
daughter
with
moroni
in
florence
but
how
did
you
know
my
daughter
she
asked
because
on
that
fatal
night
i
saw
her
in
a
house
in
london
you
saw
her
where
in
the
house
of
a
mutual
enemy
who
tennison
i
exclaimed
quietly
at
present
i
can
not
reveal
to
you
more
than
i
have
done
please
excuse
me
when
i
have
fully
verified
my
suspicions
i
will
explain
all
that
occurred
to
me
all
that
is
within
my
knowledge
until
then
please
remain
in
patience
i
never
dreamed
that
gabrielle
had
a
single
enemy
in
the
world
i
can
not
understand
it
she
exclaimed
neither
can
i
but
the
fact
remains
the
greatest
care
should
be
exercised
regarding
your
daughter
why
did
she
meet
that
frenchman
in
kensington
gardens
i
have
only
just
heard
about
it
was
her
mother
reply
it
appears
that
doctor
moroni
introduced
them
she
had
only
seen
him
once
before
then
turning
to
the
girl
her
mother
asked
what
did
he
say
to
you
he
brought
me
an
urgent
and
secret
message
from
doctor
moroni
telling
me
that
there
was
a
plot
against
my
life
she
replied
in
a
slow
mechanical
voice
the
doctor
sent
word
to
me
that
garfield
would
probably
call
and
endeavour
to
be
friendly
with
me
but
that
he
was
my
enemy
and
i
should
have
no
dealings
with
him
ah
i
exclaimed
so
that
was
the
second
warning
given
you
miss
tennison
it
is
more
than
ever
plain
that
they
fear
lest
by
meeting
we
shall
discover
the
plot
and
its
instigators
what
else
did
he
say
he
told
me
that
doctor
moroni
was
still
in
florence
but
that
he
would
be
coming
to
london
again
very
soon
and
that
he
would
call
he
urged
me
at
the
same
time
to
tell
nobody
that
he
had
seen
me
or
that
he
had
warned
me
against
you
not
even
my
mother
all
that
is
in
no
way
surprising
i
remarked
for
i
happen
to
know
that
monsieur
suzor
and
the
doctor
are
on
terms
of
closest
friendship
a
partnership
for
evil
how
as
i
have
already
explained
miss
tennison
i
have
not
yet
fully
solved
the
enigma
though
i
have
learned
a
number
of
facts
which
though
they
increase
the
mystery
yet
they
give
some
clue
to
the
solution
of
the
enigma
but
their
evil
design
asked
her
mother
their
evil
design
is
against
us
both
hence
your
daughter
interests
have
become
my
own
i
replied
my
sole
object
is
to
bring
to
justice
those
who
have
for
their
own
ends
no
doubt
for
financial
gain
been
guilty
of
the
astounding
plot
against
your
daughter
you
may
believe
doctor
moroni
and
his
friend
suzor
as
you
will
tennison
but
i
shall
not
withdraw
from
my
present
attitude
that
they
fear
me
is
conclusively
proved
i
quite
see
your
point
said
the
refined
lady
then
i
do
urge
you
to
have
a
care
of
miss
gabrielle
i
exclaimed
if
it
is
known
as
it
may
be
that
i
have
been
here
an
effort
will
surely
be
made
to
close
the
mouth
of
one
or
other
of
us
these
men
are
desperate
i
have
already
proved
them
so
therefore
we
must
take
every
precaution
against
surprise
why
not
go
to
the
police
suggested
tennison
because
the
whole
circumstances
are
so
strange
that
if
i
related
them
at
scotland
yard
i
should
not
be
believed
was
my
reply
no
i
with
my
friend
hambledon
must
carry
on
our
inquiries
alone
if
we
are
sufficiently
wary
and
active
we
may
i
hope
gather
sufficient
evidence
to
elucidate
the
mystery
of
your
daughter
present
mental
condition
and
also
the
reason
why
a
similar
attempt
was
made
upon
myself
well
garfield
exclaimed
the
charming
elderly
lady
with
a
sigh
i
only
hope
you
will
be
successful
in
your
quest
after
the
truth
this
blow
upon
me
is
i
confess
a
most
terrible
one
it
is
so
distressing
to
see
my
poor
child
in
such
an
uncertain
state
of
mentality
sometimes
as
i
have
told
you
she
is
quite
normal
though
she
has
no
knowledge
of
what
occurred
to
her
and
at
other
times
she
is
painfully
vague
and
often
erratic
in
her
actions
she
must
consult
professor
gourbeil
the
great
alienist
at
lyons
he
has
a
wide
knowledge
of
the
symptoms
and
effects
of
orosin
the
poor
lady
sighed
and
with
tired
sad
eyes
looked
upon
her
daughter
who
had
sunk
into
a
chair
with
her
pointed
chin
resting
upon
her
palms
unfortunately
garfield
i
am
not
rich
she
said
in
a
low
earnest
tone
i
will
give
most
willingly
all
i
possess
in
order
that
my
poor
child
be
restored
to
her
normal
senses
but
i
have
very
little
in
these
days
when
everything
is
so
dear
and
taxation
strangles
one
in
face
of
what
they
told
us
during
the
war
that
they
were
making
england
a
place
fit
for
heroes
to
live
in
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
now
making
it
fit
for
germans
and
aliens
to
live
in
my
dear
tennison
our
discussion
does
not
concern
politics
i
said
anxious
for
the
future
of
the
graceful
girl
whom
i
had
grown
to
love
so
dearly
even
though
her
brain
was
unbalanced
at
first
i
regarded
it
as
strange
that
being
of
oswald
de
gex
and
his
desperate
unscrupulous
accomplices
who
included
the
assassin
despujol
i
had
been
drawn
towards
her
by
some
unknown
and
invisible
attraction
but
when
i
analysed
my
feelings
and
surveyed
the
situation
calmly
i
saw
that
it
was
not
more
extraordinary
than
in
any
other
circumstances
when
a
man
seeing
a
woman
who
fulfills
all
his
high
ideals
falls
desperately
in
love
with
her
and
worships
at
her
shrine
chapter
the
the
it
was
july
the
london
season
later
in
these
modern
days
was
already
on
the
wane
the
derby
and
ascot
had
been
won
in
glorious
weather
there
had
been
splendid
cricket
at
lord
fine
polo
at
hurlingham
and
henley
week
had
just
passed
london
society
was
preparing
for
the
country
the
continental
spas
and
the
sea
leaving
the
metropolis
to
the
american
cousins
who
were
each
week
invading
london
big
hotels
i
was
back
at
francis
and
goldsmith
hard
at
work
as
i
had
been
before
my
strange
adventure
while
harry
was
busy
at
his
legal
work
in
the
police
courts
from
our
windows
looking
across
the
thames
between
the
trees
on
the
towing
path
we
had
a
wide
view
of
the
river
with
the
chimneys
of
the
factories
on
the
opposite
bank
on
the
right
was
putney
the
starting
place
of
the
university
boat
race
and
on
the
left
the
great
reservoirs
and
the
bend
of
the
river
behind
which
lay
mortlake
the
finish
of
the
course
each
morning
when
i
rose
and
dressed
i
looked
out
upon
the
wide
and
somewhat
uninteresting
vista
racking
my
brains
how
to
further
proceed
with
my
campaign
against
the
great
intriguer
who
could
by
his
immense
wealth
juggle
with
dynasties
with
tennison
i
had
become
on
very
friendly
terms
fearing
to
reveal
myself
as
having
taken
that
bundle
of
bank
of
england
notes
as
a
bribe
i
held
back
from
her
what
had
actually
happened
to
me
on
that
fateful
night
but
i
had
become
a
frequent
guest
at
longridge
road
and
often
spent
many
delightful
hours
with
gabrielle
who
at
times
seemed
quite
in
her
normal
senses
yet
at
others
she
became
vague
and
spoke
in
awed
tones
about
what
she
had
seen
all
red
green
and
gold
and
often
i
sat
at
home
smoking
and
wondering
what
she
had
seen
that
had
so
impressed
her
often
too
i
discussed
it
with
tennison
and
with
harry
hambledon
but
neither
of
us
could
suggest
any
solution
of
the
mystery
tennison
on
account
of
the
slump
in
securities
owing
to
the
war
was
i
knew
in
rather
straitened
circumstances
when
i
again
suggested
a
visit
to
the
great
specialist
in
lyons
she
shook
her
head
and
told
me
frankly
that
she
could
not
afford
it
de
gex
had
it
seemed
sought
his
victims
among
those
who
had
been
ruined
by
the
war
she
had
however
told
me
that
her
brother
a
shipping
agent
living
in
liverpool
who
was
gabrielle
godfather
was
deeply
interested
in
her
i
suggested
that
she
should
write
to
him
and
urge
that
as
a
last
resort
gabrielle
should
consult
professor
gourbeil
the
latter
had
been
successful
in
restoring
to
their
normal
mental
condition
patients
who
had
been
infected
with
orosin
that
most
dangerous
and
puzzling
of
the
discoveries
of
modern
toxicologists
tennison
had
acted
upon
my
advice
had
i
been
in
a
financial
position
to
pay
gabrielle
expenses
to
lyons
i
would
have
done
so
most
willingly
but
my
journey
to
spain
had
depleted
my
resources
and
though
i
had
those
bank
of
england
notes
still
reposing
in
a
drawer
at
home
i
dared
not
change
one
of
them
lest
by
such
action
i
should
have
accepted
and
profited
upon
the
bribe
which
de
gex
had
so
cleverly
pressed
upon
me
in
the
first
week
of
july
tennison
wrote
to
me
and
that
evening
i
went
over
to
see
her
after
leaving
the
office
in
westminster
it
was
a
hot
dry
night
when
london
lay
beneath
its
haze
of
dust
after
a
heat
spell
parched
and
choked
gabrielle
was
out
at
the
house
of
one
of
her
school
friends
hence
we
sat
alone
together
in
the
cool
a
room
which
was
essentially
that
of
a
woman
of
taste
and
refinement
a
few
seconds
after
i
had
entered
a
tall
man
came
in
whereupon
tennison
introduced
him
as
her
brother
charles
from
liverpool
the
man
glanced
at
me
sharply
and
then
smiling
pleasantly
took
my
hand
i
have
come
up
to
see
my
sister
regarding
poor
gabrielle
he
said
when
we
were
seated
i
understand
that
you
have
experienced
similar
symptoms
to
hers
and
have
recovered
i
have
not
completely
recovered
i
replied
often
i
have
little
recurrences
of
lapse
of
memory
for
periods
from
a
few
moments
to
a
quarter
of
an
hour
my
sister
has
told
me
that
you
believe
that
poor
gabrielle
and
yourself
are
of
some
plot
i
am
certain
of
it
maxwell
i
replied
and
i
have
already
devoted
considerable
time
and
more
money
than
i
could
really
afford
in
an
attempt
to
solve
the
mystery
of
it
all
can
you
explain
the
whole
circumstances
he
asked
i
am
deeply
interested
in
my
unfortunate
niece
i
can
relate
to
you
a
few
of
the
facts
if
you
wish
to
hear
them
was
my
reply
i
certainly
had
no
intention
of
telling
him
all
that
i
knew
or
of
the
death
and
cremation
of
the
mysterious
gabrielle
engledue
whoever
she
might
have
been
so
i
explained
practically
what
i
had
told
his
sister
i
also
described
how
professor
vega
at
madrid
had
told
me
of
the
two
cures
effected
by
professor
gourbeil
of
lyons
my
sister
tells
me
that
you
suggest
gabrielle
should
consult
him
maxwell
said
but
she
has
consulted
so
many
specialists
doctor
moroni
has
been
most
kind
to
her
he
took
her
to
doctors
in
paris
and
in
italy
but
they
could
do
nothing
well
i
think
that
as
professor
gourbeil
has
cured
two
persons
of
the
deadly
effects
of
the
drug
miss
tennison
should
see
him
i
remarked
i
quite
agree
it
is
for
that
reason
i
have
come
to
london
he
said
i
understand
that
you
garfield
take
a
personal
interest
in
my
niece
therefore
i
want
to
ask
you
a
favour
namely
that
if
i
pay
the
expenses
would
you
accompany
my
sister
and
her
daughter
to
lyons
willingly
but
i
will
pay
my
own
expenses
please
was
my
prompt
reply
at
first
he
would
not
hear
of
it
until
i
declined
to
go
unless
i
went
independently
and
then
we
arranged
for
our
departure
four
days
later
we
descended
at
the
big
busy
perrache
station
at
lyons
from
the
lumbering
which
had
brought
us
from
paris
and
entered
the
terminus
hôtel
which
adjoins
the
platform
later
from
the
concierge
we
found
that
professor
gourbeil
of
the
facultés
des
sciences
et
de
médecine
lived
in
the
avenue
felix
faure
and
i
succeeded
over
the
telephone
in
making
an
appointment
with
him
for
the
following
day
at
noon
this
i
kept
going
to
him
alone
in
order
to
explain
matters
i
found
him
to
be
a
short
man
with
a
shock
of
white
hair
and
a
short
white
beard
his
house
was
a
rather
large
one
standing
back
in
a
garden
full
of
flowers
and
the
room
in
which
he
received
me
was
shaded
and
cool
i
told
him
of
professor
vega
recommendation
whereupon
he
exclaimed
in
french
ah
i
know
professor
vega
we
met
last
year
at
our
conference
in
paris
a
very
brilliant
man
then
as
briefly
as
i
could
i
explained
how
the
deadly
drug
orosin
had
been
surreptitiously
administered
to
gabrielle
and
myself
and
its
effects
upon
us
both
orosin
exclaimed
the
old
savant
raising
his
thin
hands
ah
there
is
not
much
hope
of
the
lady
recovery
i
have
known
of
only
two
cases
within
my
experience
the
effect
of
orosin
upon
the
human
brain
is
mysterious
and
lasting
it
produces
a
state
of
the
with
which
we
can
not
cope
a
larger
dose
produces
strong
homicidal
tendencies
and
inevitable
death
and
a
still
larger
dose
almost
instantaneous
death
i
told
him
how
we
both
had
lost
all
sense
of
our
surroundings
for
weeks
and
how
we
were
both
found
at
the
roadside
she
in
hampshire
and
i
in
france
you
were
both
victims
of
some
plot
that
is
evident
of
course
you
have
invoked
the
aid
of
the
police
i
did
not
reply
i
certainly
feared
to
seek
the
assistance
of
scotland
yard
he
explained
to
me
practically
what
professor
vega
had
done
regarding
orosin
and
its
terrible
effect
there
have
been
other
cases
of
its
administration
said
the
great
alienist
somebody
must
be
preparing
the
drug
and
selling
it
for
sinister
purposes
though
it
is
so
little
known
as
yet
that
its
manufacturer
must
be
an
expert
toxicologist
with
special
knowledge
have
you
seen
many
cases
of
its
administration
i
asked
eagerly
yes
quite
a
number
was
the
old
professor
reply
i
am
in
communication
with
doctor
duroc
of
the
salpêtrière
in
paris
and
together
we
are
keeping
a
record
of
the
cases
where
orosin
is
administered
by
some
mysterious
hand
whose
we
have
no
idea
we
leave
that
to
the
sûreté
but
you
say
that
your
adventure
and
that
of
mademoiselle
occurred
in
london
i
repeated
my
story
then
i
ventured
to
ask
do
you
professor
know
anything
of
a
doctor
moroni
of
florence
the
man
reflected
for
a
moment
and
then
moving
in
his
chair
replied
i
fancy
i
have
heard
his
name
moroni
moroni
yes
i
am
sure
someone
has
mentioned
him
as
a
toxicologist
probably
i
do
not
really
remember
i
believe
i
met
him
at
one
of
the
conferences
in
paris
or
geneva
he
was
with
one
of
your
english
professors
one
of
your
whose
name
at
the
moment
escapes
my
memory
he
gave
evidence
in
that
curious
case
of
alleged
poison
at
the
old
bailey
in
london
a
year
ago
but
is
doctor
moroni
known
as
an
expert
in
poison
not
to
my
personal
knowledge
possibly
he
is
and
i
have
heard
his
name
in
that
connexion
why
do
you
ask
because
he
has
had
my
friend
miss
tennison
under
his
care
he
has
taken
her
to
see
several
specialists
in
italy
then
in
a
sudden
burst
of
confidence
i
told
him
of
my
great
love
for
the
girl
who
like
myself
had
been
attacked
in
secret
further
i
told
him
that
the
reason
of
my
steady
inquiry
was
in
her
interests
as
well
as
in
my
own
my
dear
monsieur
garfield
now
that
you
are
so
frank
with
me
i
will
do
my
utmost
in
the
interests
of
both
of
you
declared
the
dear
old
professor
as
he
rose
and
crossed
to
the
window
what
you
have
told
me
interests
me
intensely
i
see
by
your
travels
to
spain
and
the
south
that
you
are
leaving
no
stone
unturned
to
arrive
at
a
true
solution
of
the
problem
and
i
will
help
you
orosin
is
the
least
known
and
most
dangerous
drug
that
has
ever
been
discovered
in
our
modern
civilization
used
with
evil
intent
it
is
unsuspected
and
wellnigh
undiscoverable
for
the
symptoms
often
resemble
those
of
certain
diseases
of
the
brain
the
person
to
whom
the
drug
is
administered
either
exhibits
an
exhilaration
akin
to
undue
excess
of
alcohol
or
else
the
functions
of
the
brain
are
entirely
distorted
with
a
complete
loss
of
memory
or
a
chronic
aberration
of
the
brain
that
is
the
case
of
my
friend
miss
tennison
i
said
very
well
i
will
see
her
and
endeavour
to
do
what
i
can
to
restore
her
said
the
elegant
old
french
savant
but
remember
i
hold
out
no
hope
in
all
cases
orosin
destroys
the
brain
it
seems
to
create
a
slow
degeneracy
of
the
cells
which
nobody
yet
can
understand
we
know
the
effect
but
we
can
not
up
to
the
present
combat
it
there
are
yet
many
things
in
human
life
of
which
the
medical
men
are
in
as
complete
ignorance
as
those
who
study
electricity
and
we
try
to
do
our
best
to
the
extent
of
our
knowledge
my
dear
monsieur
and
if
you
will
bring
mademoiselle
to
me
at
three
i
will
try
to
make
my
diagnosis
i
thanked
him
for
his
perfectly
open
declaration
and
then
i
left
that
he
was
the
greatest
living
authority
on
the
symptoms
and
effect
of
the
mysterious
drug
orosin
i
felt
confident
i
only
longed
that
he
would
take
gabrielle
beneath
his
charge
and
endeavour
to
restore
her
brain
to
its
normal
function
punctually
at
three
next
day
i
called
with
my
beloved
and
her
mother
at
the
house
embowered
in
roses
and
geraniums
up
on
the
hill
above
the
broad
rhône
river
we
were
ushered
in
by
an
old
silent
and
stately
the
professor
quickly
appeared
his
sharp
eyes
upon
the
patient
i
wonder
if
you
will
allow
me
madame
to
take
your
daughter
into
my
alone
he
asked
in
good
english
it
will
be
best
for
me
to
question
her
without
any
other
person
being
present
most
certainly
tennison
replied
then
turning
to
gabrielle
she
said
the
professor
wants
to
put
a
few
questions
to
you
dear
will
you
go
with
him
into
the
next
room
gabrielle
and
tragic
looked
at
me
strangely
and
then
meekly
followed
the
old
professor
into
his
the
door
was
closed
and
tennison
waited
with
me
in
silence
the
window
of
the
room
was
open
and
through
it
came
the
sweet
scent
of
the
roses
and
climbing
jasmine
with
the
buzz
of
the
summer
insects
and
the
chatter
of
the
birds
for
the
house
was
high
up
on
that
hill
above
the
great
capital
of
the
rhône
i
rose
and
looked
out
upon
the
garden
so
well
ordered
for
the
professor
was
it
seemed
a
lover
of
roses
the
blossoms
running
riot
everywhere
suddenly
as
we
remained
in
silence
we
heard
gabrielle
voice
raised
until
she
shouted
fierce
defiant
words
in
english
no
she
shrieked
it
was
not
that
not
that
you
try
and
fix
upon
me
a
deed
that
i
did
not
do
why
should
you
do
this
why
should
you
do
this
pardon
mademoiselle
we
heard
the
professor
say
in
a
quiet
calm
tone
pardon
please
i
do
not
allege
it
i
have
only
asked
a
simple
question
your
question
is
insulting
doctor
declared
my
beloved
loudly
why
should
you
insinuate
such
a
thing
mademoiselle
i
insinuate
nothing
replied
the
professor
i
am
endeavouring
to
ascertain
the
exact
state
of
your
mental
balance
your
anger
is
in
itself
a
most
gratifying
feature
a
thousand
pardons
if
you
feel
that
i
have
insulted
you
he
added
with
the
extreme
politeness
of
his
race
then
through
the
folding
doors
which
divided
the
apartments
we
heard
him
say
will
you
please
give
me
both
your
hands
and
look
directly
into
my
eyes
there
was
a
silence
we
could
hear
the
professor
sigh
but
he
made
no
comment
his
examination
occupied
nearly
an
hour
he
put
to
her
many
searching
questions
in
an
endeavour
to
restore
her
memory
as
to
what
happened
but
without
avail
those
questions
seemed
to
perturb
her
for
of
a
sudden
she
cried
loudly
indeed
she
almost
shrieked
in
terror
ah
no
no
save
me
she
implored
i
i
ca
stand
it
i
ca
i
really
ca
see
look
look
there
it
is
again
all
red
green
and
gold
all
red
green
and
gold
and
we
could
hear
her
expressions
of
fear
as
she
gazed
upon
some
imaginary
object
which
held
her
terrified
we
heard
the
kindly
old
professor
putting
many
questions
to
her
in
an
endeavour
to
discover
what
gave
rise
to
that
nameless
horror
which
she
so
often
experienced
but
her
replies
were
most
vague
she
seemed
unable
to
describe
the
chimera
of
her
imagination
yet
it
was
only
too
plain
that
on
that
fatal
night
she
had
seen
something
bearing
those
colours
which
had
so
impressed
itself
upon
her
mind
as
distinctly
horrible
that
it
constantly
recurred
to
her
yet
she
was
unable
to
describe
it
owing
to
her
mental
aberration
time
after
time
she
implored
the
professor
protection
from
some
imaginary
peril
and
time
after
time
after
she
had
begged
him
to
remain
near
her
she
repeated
those
mysterious
and
meaningless
words
red
green
and
gold
red
green
and
gold
in
breathless
anxiety
we
listened
but
all
we
could
hear
were
the
professor
sighs
of
despair
which
meant
far
more
to
tennison
and
myself
than
any
of
his
words
could
convey
we
knew
that
upon
poor
gabrielle
the
girl
i
loved
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
the
deadly
drug
had
done
its
work
and
that
she
was
alas
incurable
her
case
was
hopeless
even
in
the
hands
of
the
one
man
in
all
europe
who
knew
the
effects
of
orosin
and
had
only
in
two
cases
effected
cures
i
looked
at
her
mother
in
silence
she
knew
my
thoughts
for
tears
were
now
coursing
down
her
pale
cheeks
both
of
us
knew
the
worst
our
journey
had
been
in
vain
that
thought
caused
me
to
grit
my
teeth
against
de
gex
and
his
unholy
hirelings
i
would
follow
and
unmask
them
i
would
avenge
the
innocent
girl
whom
i
loved
so
dearly
even
though
it
should
cost
me
my
life
chapter
the
yet
another
mystery
the
first
week
in
august
was
unusually
hot
and
dry
in
london
gabrielle
and
tennison
had
remained
in
lyons
for
professor
gourbeil
had
suggested
that
his
patient
should
as
a
desperate
resource
remain
under
his
treatment
for
a
few
weeks
he
gave
practically
no
hope
of
her
recovery
the
dose
of
orosin
that
had
been
administered
was
he
declared
a
larger
one
than
that
which
de
gex
had
introduced
into
my
drink
on
that
night
of
horrors
the
effect
upon
me
had
been
to
muddle
my
brain
so
that
i
had
accepted
those
bank
of
england
notes
as
bribe
to
assist
the
of
europe
in
his
foul
and
mysterious
plot
my
companion
harry
hambledon
was
still
earning
his
guineas
at
hammersmith
police
court
gradually
establishing
a
reputation
he
had
bought
a
small
car
and
each
sunday
he
took
norah
out
for
runs
to
the
hut
at
wisley
to
the
burford
bridge
hotel
where
the
genial
hunt
one
of
the
last
remaining
bohemians
of
the
days
of
the
junior
garrick
club
welcomed
them
to
the
wooton
hatch
or
up
to
those
more
pretentious
and
less
comfortable
hostelries
on
hindhead
motoring
had
roused
a
new
interest
in
my
friend
i
loved
the
open
road
but
with
the
heavy
expenses
i
had
recently
sustained
i
could
not
afford
it
besides
my
firm
had
just
secured
a
big
electric
lighting
contract
with
the
corporation
of
chichester
and
i
was
constantly
travelling
between
that
city
and
london
sometimes
by
rail
and
sometimes
in
francis
car
i
suppose
i
must
have
carried
on
my
work
satisfactorily
after
the
generous
leave
the
firm
one
of
those
stately
ones
which
have
still
survived
the
war
had
accorded
me
but
my
thoughts
were
ever
of
my
beloved
gabrielle
the
beautiful
girl
whom
though
her
mind
was
so
strongly
unbalanced
i
yet
loved
with
all
the
strength
of
my
being
every
few
days
we
exchanged
letters
sometimes
tennison
wrote
to
me
from
the
quiet
little
pension
in
the
rue
paul
bert
in
lyons
but
her
letters
were
always
despairing
poor
gabrielle
was
just
the
same
she
still
had
no
other
vista
in
life
than
her
immediate
one
and
she
still
in
her
reflective
moments
gave
vent
to
that
strange
ejaculation
of
those
mysterious
words
red
green
and
gold
red
green
and
gold
i
confess
that
i
went
about
my
business
in
a
despairing
mood
more
than
once
i
passed
by
that
dark
forbidding
house
in
stretton
street
the
blinds
of
which
were
drawn
for
ever
since
the
winter
it
had
been
closed
with
the
caretaker
in
charge
pass
along
park
lane
and
the
mayfair
neighbourhood
in
august
and
you
will
see
the
holland
blinds
drawn
everywhere
the
filled
with
geraniums
and
marguerites
are
drooping
for
they
have
served
their
turn
and
the
families
are
out
of
town
enjoying
themselves
in
scotland
in
norway
or
at
the
french
spas
honest
londoners
may
sweat
and
toil
with
their
begrudged
fourteen
days
at
the
sea
or
in
the
country
but
society
caring
nothing
for
unhealthy
trades
or
labour
unless
a
strike
perchance
affects
their
pockets
or
their
comforts
drifts
to
where
it
can
flirt
dance
or
gamble
amid
gay
surroundings
denied
in
london
by
our
sanctimonious
whenever
i
passed
along
stretton
street
there
spread
over
my
mind
the
strange
and
inexplicable
events
of
that
night
when
de
horton
had
dashed
out
after
me
and
suddenly
implored
me
to
see
his
master
ah
i
saw
the
amazing
cleverness
of
the
whole
plot
a
plot
such
as
could
only
be
conceived
by
a
master
brain
de
gex
dark
sinister
countenance
haunted
me
in
my
dreams
true
he
was
a
man
who
swayed
the
finances
of
europe
suave
smiling
and
with
an
extremely
polished
and
refined
exterior
but
why
suzor
had
purposely
become
acquainted
with
me
and
why
i
had
afterwards
been
enticed
into
that
house
of
tragedy
were
in
themselves
two
points
the
motive
of
which
i
failed
to
grasp
late
one
evening
i
passed
the
house
going
out
of
my
way
purposely
to
do
so
when
to
my
amazement
i
saw
standing
upon
the
doorstep
and
about
to
enter
his
car
no
other
person
than
oswald
de
gex
himself
behind
him
stood
a
strange
who
at
the
moment
seemed
to
be
taking
some
instructions
in
the
darkness
de
gex
could
not
distinguish
me
therefore
i
drew
back
and
watched
the
financier
enter
the
car
and
drive
away
so
oswald
de
gex
was
back
in
london
and
in
august
i
had
passed
the
house
on
the
previous
afternoon
and
seen
that
as
usual
the
faded
holland
blinds
were
drawn
just
as
they
had
been
for
months
an
indication
to
callers
that
the
owner
was
away
i
looked
again
the
blinds
were
still
down
next
day
being
sunday
i
watched
and
though
at
four
in
the
afternoon
de
gex
came
forth
and
strolled
round
to
his
club
in
james
street
the
blinds
were
still
drawn
it
being
evident
that
the
unscrupulous
man
who
juggled
with
european
dynasties
was
living
there
in
obscurity
and
in
pretence
of
absence
why
my
watchfulness
was
increased
my
thoughts
being
ever
upon
the
avenging
of
the
injury
done
to
the
sweet
girl
i
so
dearly
loved
that
poor
unfortunate
creature
whose
brain
had
been
destroyed
by
the
dastardly
administration
of
that
poison
only
known
to
students
of
toxicology
in
my
waking
hours
i
conjured
up
scenes
of
how
mother
and
daughter
living
in
that
obscure
pension
in
busy
lyons
went
each
day
to
the
professor
house
and
how
the
kindly
old
savant
did
his
best
to
restore
her
brain
to
its
normal
activity
one
hot
day
i
had
been
to
reading
on
business
for
the
firm
and
on
arrival
at
paddington
i
bought
an
evening
paper
and
took
it
home
to
rivermead
mansions
as
usual
harry
and
i
had
dinner
together
and
after
he
had
gone
out
to
richmond
i
sat
by
the
open
window
which
looked
upon
the
beside
the
thames
and
with
my
pipe
in
my
mouth
scanned
the
day
news
of
a
sudden
i
came
across
a
heading
which
attracted
me
and
read
as
follows
the
sudden
death
is
announced
at
his
house
outside
amsterdam
of
baron
harte
van
veltrup
the
dutch
financier
who
for
some
years
was
in
active
association
with
the
spanish
banker
the
late
count
de
chamartin
the
count
died
recently
in
san
sebastian
just
after
he
with
van
veltrup
had
promoted
a
great
railway
scheme
in
central
spain
the
circumstances
of
the
baron
death
appear
to
be
somewhat
mysterious
says
our
amsterdam
correspondent
three
days
ago
the
banker
who
is
a
widower
went
to
the
hague
where
in
a
private
room
in
an
obscure
hotel
he
met
a
man
on
business
the
meeting
was
apparently
in
secret
for
he
told
his
valet
that
he
did
not
wish
anyone
to
know
of
the
mysterious
visitor
for
a
certain
financial
reason
the
man
remained
with
the
baron
for
nearly
an
hour
after
which
the
financier
went
home
in
his
car
to
amsterdam
his
valet
driving
on
the
way
the
servant
noticed
that
his
master
seemed
very
perturbed
once
or
twice
muttering
threats
beneath
his
breath
on
arrival
at
his
house
facing
vondel
park
he
dressed
ate
his
dinner
alone
and
was
about
to
his
car
to
drive
to
the
park
schouwburg
where
opera
was
being
given
that
night
when
he
staggered
and
fell
just
outside
the
gate
and
expired
in
a
few
moments
though
a
medical
examination
proved
that
death
was
due
to
heart
failure
some
comment
has
been
caused
by
the
story
of
his
master
mysterious
visitor
at
the
hague
the
latter
he
describes
as
with
a
small
dark
moustache
a
ruddy
complexion
wearing
round
spectacles
he
thinks
the
latter
were
worn
for
purposes
of
disguise
three
doctors
have
however
declared
that
death
ensued
from
natural
causes
hence
the
police
discredit
the
story
baron
van
veltrup
who
was
well
known
in
international
finance
was
a
frequent
visitor
to
london
where
he
had
permanent
chambers
in
jermyn
street
he
was
in
the
habit
of
receiving
strange
callers
persons
who
probably
gave
him
secret
information
regarding
government
concessions
and
other
such
matters
therefore
it
is
not
believed
that
the
man
whom
he
met
in
secret
has
any
connexion
with
his
sudden
and
lamented
death
the
baron
contributed
most
generously
to
dutch
charities
especially
to
the
blinden
institution
of
which
he
was
one
of
the
governors
some
of
his
financial
deals
were
of
outstanding
magnitude
the
last
loan
to
peru
was
made
through
his
house
in
combination
with
that
of
chamartin
in
madrid
while
he
negotiated
a
big
loan
to
serbia
immediately
before
the
war
as
well
as
obtaining
the
concessions
for
two
new
railways
in
northern
italy
and
in
portugal
the
reputation
of
the
house
of
veltrup
was
one
of
the
highest
standing
and
the
untimely
death
has
cast
a
gloom
over
financial
circles
in
all
the
european
capitals
i
raised
my
eyes
from
the
paper
and
gazed
across
the
thames
now
growing
grey
in
the
evening
light
outside
the
soft
wind
whispered
in
the
trees
and
across
the
long
suspension
bridge
ran
an
endless
stream
of
motor
traffic
into
and
out
of
london
the
affair
in
amsterdam
was
certainly
curious
but
what
attracted
me
most
was
the
fact
that
the
dead
baron
had
been
a
partner
with
the
late
count
chamartin
whose
widow
i
knew
by
sight
the
count
had
also
died
very
suddenly
so
within
a
short
time
of
each
other
two
men
whose
names
were
ones
to
conjure
with
in
international
finance
had
both
died
the
valet
story
i
did
not
doubt
i
knew
that
such
men
as
the
late
baron
were
often
compelled
in
their
own
interests
to
receive
visits
from
mysterious
and
often
undesirable
persons
most
of
whom
were
paid
for
their
information
every
giant
of
finance
employs
his
secret
agents
whose
duty
it
is
to
keep
his
principal
informed
of
the
various
political
and
other
secrets
in
europe
indeed
the
great
financiers
know
more
of
the
underground
currents
of
foreign
politics
than
they
do
at
any
embassy
or
ministry
of
foreign
affairs
it
is
their
duty
to
know
the
secrets
of
nations
and
they
profit
upon
their
knowledge
i
sat
ruminating
the
sudden
deaths
of
the
two
pillars
of
finance
was
to
say
the
least
a
curious
coincidence
i
recollected
that
chamartin
had
been
associated
with
de
gex
and
the
object
of
the
journey
to
madrid
had
apparently
been
to
interview
his
dead
widow
i
also
remembered
professor
vega
description
of
the
deadly
effect
of
that
secret
poison
orosin
that
it
might
cause
almost
instant
death
and
that
all
doctors
would
attribute
the
cause
to
heart
failure
this
caused
me
to
ponder
for
a
long
time
i
read
and
the
report
of
the
baron
death
and
when
i
retired
to
bed
harry
not
having
yet
returned
i
could
not
sleep
so
haunted
was
i
by
vague
suspicions
next
day
i
found
that
i
could
not
apply
myself
to
work
at
the
office
so
gave
it
up
and
once
more
wandered
towards
hyde
park
corner
and
up
park
lane
where
again
i
passed
through
stretton
street
the
blinds
of
the
big
dark
mansion
were
all
lowered
indicating
that
its
owner
was
still
out
of
town
yet
i
knew
that
he
was
living
in
the
half
darkness
of
that
closed
house
why
several
days
passed
when
unable
to
rest
i
at
last
asked
leave
of
absence
from
old
francis
and
crossed
by
the
from
harwich
to
the
hook
of
holland
on
the
following
day
i
found
myself
in
quaint
old
amsterdam
that
city
built
upon
the
sand
in
defiance
of
a
certain
text
in
matthew
the
city
with
its
great
network
of
canals
and
its
many
barges
as
i
left
my
hotel
and
walked
to
the
dam
the
central
square
of
the
city
my
nostrils
were
saluted
upon
one
side
by
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
adorning
the
windows
and
the
odour
of
while
on
the
other
was
the
smell
of
tar
and
the
fumes
of
the
humble
kitchens
of
sailing
vessels
i
happened
to
know
an
englishman
employed
as
clerk
to
a
firm
of
dutch
forwarding
agents
whose
offices
were
in
the
dam
and
this
man
whose
name
was
graham
i
at
once
sought
we
went
out
to
a
café
together
and
i
explained
the
object
of
my
visit
namely
the
investigation
of
the
death
of
baron
van
veltrup
graham
at
once
regarded
me
with
considerable
astonishment
for
very
naturally
he
could
not
make
out
why
i
should
take
such
a
keen
interest
in
the
death
of
one
of
the
richest
men
in
holland
the
baron
died
of
heart
failure
my
friend
said
the
doctors
are
agreed
upon
that
his
valet
told
some
extraordinary
story
but
no
credence
has
been
placed
in
it
there
has
been
a
good
deal
in
the
papers
concerning
the
unfortunate
affair
but
the
excitement
has
now
all
died
down
the
baron
was
i
believe
buried
yesterday
i
know
that
there
is
no
suspicion
that
death
was
due
to
foul
play
graham
i
said
but
i
confess
that
in
face
of
certain
knowledge
i
possess
i
am
not
altogether
satisfied
with
the
doctor
conclusion
my
friend
smiled
incredulously
at
first
the
police
were
i
heard
inclined
to
suspect
foul
play
but
after
full
investigation
they
are
now
quite
satisfied
as
to
the
cause
of
death
be
that
as
it
may
i
intend
to
make
a
few
discreet
inquiries
i
replied
resolutely
i
want
you
if
you
will
to
assist
me
he
smiled
again
in
undisguised
disbelief
of
course
you
are
at
liberty
to
express
your
own
opinion
he
said
with
some
reluctance
and
if
you
wish
i
will
assist
you
but
i
really
think
garfield
that
you
will
be
only
wasting
your
time
and
mine
i
hope
not
i
assured
him
were
i
not
in
possession
of
certain
exclusive
information
i
should
not
venture
to
come
here
from
london
and
trouble
you
as
i
am
doing
graham
whom
i
had
known
for
a
number
of
years
looked
very
straight
at
me
what
is
the
nature
of
this
exclusive
information
he
inquired
you
are
concealing
something
hugh
yes
i
know
i
am
was
my
reply
as
i
smiled
at
him
i
am
here
to
discover
the
truth
regarding
the
death
of
baron
van
veltrup
then
you
suspect
foul
play
eh
asked
my
friend
yes
i
do
i
replied
in
a
low
voice
and
i
want
you
graham
to
put
me
in
touch
with
the
baron
valet
he
is
a
man
named
folcker
a
swede
according
to
the
newspapers
i
dare
say
i
could
find
him
if
you
can
you
will
assist
me
very
much
i
must
have
a
chat
with
him
i
said
i
feel
somehow
that
in
face
of
the
strange
facts
within
my
knowledge
that
he
can
give
me
the
clue
to
the
cause
of
his
death
graham
smiled
he
seemed
to
regard
me
as
a
person
whose
mind
was
not
quite
sound
but
i
will
give
him
his
due
he
propitiated
me
and
promised
to
get
into
touch
with
oscar
folcker
by
virtue
of
the
wide
ramifications
of
the
firm
by
which
graham
was
employed
i
knew
that
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
hence
i
was
not
surprised
when
next
day
he
rang
me
up
on
the
telephone
to
my
hotel
and
told
me
that
he
had
been
able
to
find
the
valet
folcker
who
would
call
upon
me
at
six
that
evening
chapter
the
what
the
valet
knew
at
the
time
appointed
as
i
stood
in
the
hall
a
tall
rather
spruce
young
man
entered
and
spoke
to
the
concierge
who
at
once
brought
him
over
to
me
i
took
him
into
a
corner
of
the
lounge
and
when
we
were
seated
i
told
him
of
my
suspicions
and
my
quest
like
many
swedes
he
spoke
english
and
in
reply
said
well
sir
i
was
in
the
baron
service
for
five
years
and
i
knew
his
habits
very
well
he
was
an
excellent
master
most
kind
and
generous
and
with
him
i
have
travelled
europe
up
and
down
we
were
very
often
in
london
where
the
baron
had
bachelor
chambers
in
jermyn
street
i
know
that
i
said
but
tell
me
what
you
know
and
what
you
suspect
concerning
his
untimely
end
there
was
foul
play
sir
he
said
unhesitatingly
the
baron
was
a
strong
healthy
man
who
lived
frugally
and
though
he
dealt
in
millions
of
francs
yet
he
was
most
quiet
in
his
habits
and
his
boast
was
that
he
was
never
out
of
bed
after
ten
though
very
rich
he
devoted
nearly
half
his
income
yearly
to
charitable
institutions
i
know
the
extent
of
his
contributions
to
the
needy
for
i
have
often
seen
him
draw
the
cheques
well
tell
me
exactly
what
happened
i
asked
the
affair
presents
some
very
puzzling
features
sir
he
replied
one
morning
while
dressing
my
master
told
me
that
he
had
to
motor
to
the
hague
as
he
wished
to
meet
in
strict
secrecy
a
man
who
would
call
to
see
him
at
a
little
hotel
called
the
rhijn
in
the
oranje
straat
he
asked
me
to
drive
him
there
so
that
mullard
the
chauffeur
should
have
no
knowledge
of
the
visit
this
i
promised
to
do
for
i
can
drive
a
car
we
arrived
early
in
the
afternoon
and
the
baron
who
was
unknown
at
the
obscure
little
place
ordered
lunch
for
us
both
he
ate
his
in
the
private
room
he
had
engaged
and
at
about
three
the
visitor
arrived
he
inquired
of
the
proprietor
and
was
shown
into
the
baron
private
room
i
judged
him
to
be
about
forty
of
middle
height
and
wearing
big
round
tortoiseshell
glasses
like
those
americans
so
often
wear
he
was
and
walked
with
a
slight
limp
and
what
happened
while
your
master
was
with
the
stranger
the
baron
came
out
and
told
me
to
go
to
the
garage
with
the
car
and
i
was
telephoned
for
an
hour
later
when
i
met
him
again
he
seemed
to
be
in
an
ill
and
petulant
mood
for
he
told
me
to
drive
back
to
amsterdam
with
all
speed
he
also
again
made
me
promise
to
tell
nobody
of
the
secret
meeting
and
then
i
asked
anxiously
on
arrival
home
he
washed
dressed
and
dined
alone
afterwards
he
put
on
his
gloves
grey
suède
ones
ready
to
go
but
exchanged
them
for
a
pair
of
white
ones
as
he
recollected
that
he
was
going
to
the
opera
then
he
walked
out
to
the
car
but
suddenly
cried
my
head
my
head
and
fell
on
to
the
pavement
i
was
just
behind
him
when
he
did
so
and
hurried
to
get
him
up
but
he
was
already
unconscious
and
scarcely
before
we
could
get
him
into
the
house
he
expired
and
why
do
you
suspect
foul
play
i
asked
i
feel
certain
that
my
master
did
not
die
from
natural
causes
declared
the
you
suspect
that
the
individual
in
round
spectacles
had
a
hand
in
it
eh
i
do
but
how
i
have
no
idea
the
police
my
suspicions
but
if
my
suspicions
are
unfounded
why
has
not
the
stranger
come
forward
there
has
been
a
lot
about
the
affair
in
the
papers
yes
i
said
it
certainly
appears
strange
for
there
can
be
no
cause
for
secrecy
now
that
the
baron
is
dead
even
if
some
great
financial
transaction
had
been
involved
my
master
often
received
very
queer
visitors
said
folcker
once
he
entertained
two
very
shabby
individuals
when
he
was
at
with
de
gex
with
de
gex
i
echoed
was
the
baron
a
friend
of
his
yes
an
intimate
friend
they
often
had
big
deals
together
in
which
count
chamartin
who
lived
in
madrid
participated
ah
that
is
distinctly
interesting
i
said
did
the
baron
when
in
london
visit
de
gex
at
stretton
street
frequently
they
were
mutually
interested
in
the
great
netherlands
shipping
combine
about
a
year
ago
replied
the
valet
and
you
usually
travelled
with
your
master
i
suppose
nearly
always
we
were
frequently
in
paris
berlin
rome
or
madrid
and
naturally
i
learnt
a
good
deal
about
his
business
his
most
intimate
friend
was
de
gex
do
you
happen
to
know
him
i
gritted
my
teeth
and
replied
in
the
affirmative
a
very
charming
man
the
valet
declared
he
was
always
very
good
to
the
servants
i
used
to
look
after
him
when
he
visited
us
here
in
amsterdam
did
you
ever
meet
a
friend
of
his
a
frenchman
named
suzor
i
asked
yes
once
when
we
stayed
with
de
gex
at
florence
he
was
a
fellow
guest
with
my
master
and
an
italian
doctor
named
moroni
folcker
shook
his
head
as
he
replied
i
have
no
recollection
of
an
italian
doctor
we
were
in
florence
only
two
weeks
of
course
you
know
de
gex
butler
a
man
named
horton
i
asked
no
the
man
i
know
is
named
farmer
i
have
been
to
stretton
street
for
over
a
year
it
would
therefore
appear
that
horton
was
a
new
servant
but
have
you
any
idea
how
your
master
died
was
my
next
query
none
only
something
tells
me
that
he
fell
victim
to
a
plot
for
his
assassination
why
because
he
more
than
once
told
me
that
if
he
died
certain
persons
would
derive
great
benefits
who
his
friends
i
suppose
so
including
de
gex
the
man
shook
his
head
saying
ah
that
i
can
not
tell
sir
but
i
know
that
de
gex
owed
the
baron
a
very
considerable
sum
over
a
financial
deal
regarding
some
oil
wells
in
roumania
only
a
few
months
ago
he
mentioned
to
grant
one
of
his
friends
in
my
presence
that
he
hoped
de
gex
would
very
soon
settle
with
him
in
fact
he
seemed
annoyed
at
the
delay
in
the
payment
this
statement
caused
me
to
reflect
deeply
was
it
really
possible
that
the
dutch
baron
death
had
been
due
to
the
machinations
of
this
of
europe
the
fact
that
he
owed
the
dead
man
money
would
serve
as
sufficient
motive
i
did
not
overlook
the
plot
against
myself
one
that
must
have
sent
me
swiftly
into
my
grave
had
it
not
been
for
my
providential
escape
the
whole
amazing
facts
my
meeting
with
suzor
in
the
express
between
york
and
king
cross
the
trap
set
for
me
at
stretton
street
and
my
astounding
adventures
afterwards
all
flashed
through
my
mind
oswald
de
gex
was
a
most
unscrupulous
person
who
had
climbed
to
fame
and
fortune
over
the
ruined
homes
and
bodies
of
his
victims
i
was
now
out
to
obtain
direct
and
undeniable
evidence
of
his
crimes
yet
up
to
the
present
i
could
not
go
much
further
than
mere
surmise
two
of
his
business
friends
count
chamartin
and
baron
van
veltrup
had
died
quite
suddenly
in
the
case
of
the
latter
the
valet
expressed
a
positive
belief
that
his
master
had
not
died
of
natural
causes
this
was
supported
by
the
fact
that
the
baron
received
a
mysterious
visitor
at
an
obscure
hotel
at
the
hague
a
man
who
was
apparently
disguised
by
big
horn
spectacles
and
was
certainly
not
a
dutchman
and
above
all
that
i
held
most
conclusive
evidence
that
both
de
gex
himself
and
the
dead
bandit
despujol
had
used
that
deadly
drug
orosin
to
secure
their
nefarious
ends
but
the
most
irritating
feature
of
the
affair
was
that
i
was
as
far
off
as
ever
from
solving
the
mystery
of
what
happened
on
that
memorable
night
in
stretton
street
or
with
what
motive
i
had
been
induced
to
give
a
death
certificate
that
had
enabled
the
body
of
an
unknown
girl
to
be
cremated
i
questioned
the
valet
folcker
still
further
telling
him
that
i
had
come
especially
from
london
to
endeavour
to
elucidate
the
truth
concerning
his
master
death
he
was
devoted
to
the
baron
and
was
highly
incensed
at
the
attitude
taken
by
the
dutch
police
i
will
give
you
every
assistance
sir
he
replied
excellent
i
said
i
would
very
much
like
to
go
to
the
house
could
you
take
me
there
most
certainly
sir
was
his
response
and
with
willingness
he
accompanied
me
in
a
horse
cab
up
the
cobbled
leidwche
straat
with
its
many
canals
to
the
pleasant
vondel
park
just
outside
the
city
we
stopped
before
a
great
white
house
square
and
rather
inartistic
standing
back
behind
very
high
iron
railings
to
which
we
were
admitted
by
an
elderly
who
was
in
charge
of
the
place
now
that
its
owner
was
dead
folcker
showed
me
his
master
handsome
which
had
been
left
practically
as
it
was
on
the
night
of
his
tragic
end
he
showed
me
how
the
baron
had
put
on
his
evening
clothes
and
descended
to
dine
he
took
me
into
the
fine
with
big
long
carved
table
in
the
centre
and
showed
me
the
small
round
table
set
in
the
big
bow
window
looking
out
upon
the
garden
at
which
the
baron
always
ate
his
meals
when
alone
after
finishing
his
dinner
the
baron
smoked
one
of
his
petroff
cigarettes
which
were
especially
made
for
him
in
odessa
and
then
calling
me
he
asked
for
his
coat
and
told
me
to
ring
up
for
the
car
folcker
said
he
finished
his
cigarette
and
a
glass
of
kümmel
at
the
same
time
scanning
the
evening
newspaper
all
the
time
he
had
been
eating
however
he
seemed
in
a
very
angry
mood
the
interview
with
the
stranger
at
the
hague
had
somehow
upset
him
for
once
or
twice
he
muttered
angrily
to
himself
now
tell
me
folcker
i
asked
seriously
when
he
entered
that
little
hotel
at
the
hague
he
waited
for
his
mysterious
visitor
did
he
not
yes
sir
the
visitor
arrived
and
you
saw
him
i
understand
that
your
master
came
out
and
saw
you
during
the
interview
yes
about
ten
minutes
after
the
stranger
arrival
the
baron
came
into
the
little
hall
of
the
hotel
and
told
me
that
he
would
not
require
me
for
an
hour
or
perhaps
more
apparently
he
did
not
wish
the
car
to
stand
outside
the
place
for
so
long
lest
it
should
be
recognized
so
he
sent
me
to
a
garage
i
hesitated
then
the
stranger
was
left
inside
the
hotel
alone
yes
sir
for
two
or
three
minutes
why
we
were
standing
out
in
the
hall
and
i
glanced
around
your
master
was
in
quite
good
health
as
he
ate
his
dinner
and
smoked
his
cigarette
i
remarked
quite
he
came
out
of
the
room
and
standing
here
i
gave
him
his
hat
coat
gloves
and
stick
after
he
had
put
on
his
coat
he
drew
on
his
glove
suddenly
he
tore
it
off
again
and
rubbing
his
fingers
together
impatiently
said
forgot
folcker
i
going
to
the
opera
give
me
some
white
gloves
they
were
in
the
drawer
yonder
the
valet
said
pointing
to
a
great
old
carved
flemish
cupboard
so
i
got
them
out
and
handed
them
to
him
he
drew
one
of
them
on
and
walked
down
to
the
gate
to
enter
the
car
when
he
suddenly
fell
upon
the
pavement
outside
you
see
just
yonder
and
he
pointed
through
the
open
door
why
did
he
rub
his
fingers
together
i
wonder
i
remarked
was
it
a
habit
of
his
not
at
all
sir
he
seemed
to
have
a
sudden
pain
in
his
fingers
a
pain
why
i
do
know
sir
it
has
only
this
moment
occurred
to
me
he
flung
off
the
glove
and
tossed
it
upon
the
table
it
still
there
as
you
see
then
he
put
on
the
white
gloves
and
went
down
the
steps
and
collapsed
his
head
was
affected
yes
he
cried
out
twice
that
his
head
hurt
him
the
doctors
attribute
his
death
to
heart
failure
but
personally
i
doubt
it
sir
certain
that
there
was
foul
play
somewhere
i
crossed
to
the
great
carved
table
which
stood
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
wide
hall
tiled
as
it
was
with
ancient
blue
and
white
dutch
tiles
and
from
the
table
took
up
a
pair
of
grey
suède
gloves
they
interested
me
because
after
putting
one
on
the
baron
had
torn
it
off
and
rubbed
his
fingers
is
this
the
glove
your
master
wore
when
he
went
to
the
hague
i
asked
selecting
the
one
yes
sir
i
examined
it
closely
and
very
gingerly
the
exterior
presented
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
on
turning
it
inside
out
i
found
in
the
index
finger
a
tiny
piece
of
steel
which
tumbled
out
upon
the
table
it
was
apparently
a
piece
clipped
from
the
blade
of
a
safety
razor
and
keenly
sharp
anyone
inserting
a
finger
into
the
glove
would
certainly
be
cut
by
the
razor
edge
of
that
sharp
scrap
of
steel
as
it
lay
upon
the
polished
oak
i
bent
to
look
at
it
the
valet
also
standing
near
and
bending
down
in
curiosity
upon
it
something
had
apparently
been
smeared
some
colourless
jelly
it
seemed
had
baron
van
veltrup
fallen
victim
to
orosin
wilfully
administered
that
was
my
instant
suspicion
one
that
was
afterwards
verified
by
the
great
dutch
pathologist
doctor
obelt
who
lived
in
the
amstel
straat
and
to
whom
i
carried
the
mysterious
but
incriminating
scrap
of
steel
without
a
doubt
this
piece
of
has
been
impregnated
with
a
new
and
most
deadly
poison
orosin
he
declared
to
me
on
the
following
evening
as
i
sat
in
his
consulting
room
the
police
have
seen
no
mysterious
circumstances
in
the
unfortunate
death
of
the
baron
who
by
the
way
was
a
very
dear
friend
of
mine
but
now
you
have
brought
me
this
piece
of
steel
which
you
took
from
his
glove
and
which
no
doubt
must
have
caused
a
slight
cut
to
his
finger
and
in
consequence
almost
instant
death
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
take
up
the
matter
with
the
authorities
i
shall
be
much
gratified
doctor
if
you
will
i
urged
speaking
in
french
the
valet
suspicions
of
foul
play
are
entirely
proved
yes
foul
play
committed
by
somebody
who
possesses
expert
toxicological
knowledge
i
confess
that
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
discovered
orosin
the
hint
you
gave
me
caused
me
to
search
for
it
and
that
i
have
found
it
is
undoubted
later
that
day
i
accompanied
the
doctor
to
the
bureau
of
police
where
we
were
met
by
a
very
stolid
official
who
smoked
a
long
thin
cigar
all
the
time
he
talked
to
us
at
first
he
treated
the
affair
as
of
no
importance
the
medical
evidence
had
pronounced
the
baron
death
as
having
been
due
to
natural
causes
the
police
could
not
interfere
further
he
declared
ah
but
thanks
to
the
baron
valet
we
now
have
evidence
of
a
most
subtle
and
deadly
poison
declared
the
dutch
pathologist
i
certify
that
i
have
found
upon
a
small
piece
of
sharp
steel
which
has
been
discovered
in
the
dead
man
glove
traces
of
orosin
one
of
the
least
known
but
most
dangerous
poisons
the
dutch
police
official
straightened
himself
in
his
chair
is
that
really
so
doctor
he
asked
in
surprise
holding
his
cigar
between
his
fingers
yes
it
is
doctor
obelt
replied
the
body
must
be
exhumed
and
an
examination
made
to
ascertain
if
there
is
a
small
cut
in
the
first
finger
of
the
left
hand
if
there
is
then
the
baron
has
been
secretly
murdered
the
valet
has
alleged
this
all
along
but
there
being
no
evidence
we
disbelieved
him
said
the
official
at
once
there
is
now
evidence
direct
evidence
said
the
dutch
doctor
this
englishman
here
is
interested
in
some
way
in
the
baron
death
and
after
discovering
the
scrap
of
he
brought
it
to
me
the
dutch
police
official
knit
his
brows
and
turning
to
me
asked
did
you
yourself
discover
this
piece
of
steel
i
did
from
certain
facts
within
my
knowledge
i
suspected
that
the
baron
had
been
deliberately
killed
the
allegations
of
the
valet
folcker
strengthened
my
suspicions
hence
i
travelled
from
london
and
pursued
my
own
independent
inquiries
which
have
resulted
in
the
discovery
of
the
little
piece
of
blade
inside
the
glove
which
the
baron
wore
when
he
went
to
interview
his
mysterious
visitor
at
the
hague
but
what
evidence
have
we
that
the
mysterious
visitor
the
individual
who
has
been
referred
to
in
the
report
as
the
man
with
the
round
horn
glasses
had
anything
to
do
with
the
affair
according
to
the
baron
servant
the
visitor
was
left
alone
for
a
few
moments
in
the
room
where
van
veltrup
had
put
down
his
gloves
in
order
to
go
out
and
speak
to
his
valet
who
on
that
day
was
acting
as
his
chauffeur
it
was
in
those
moments
of
his
absence
that
the
unknown
visitor
put
the
infected
scrap
of
steel
into
the
baron
glove
did
he
not
wear
the
gloves
on
his
way
back
to
amsterdam
asked
the
police
official
as
he
laid
down
his
thin
cigar
no
i
replied
the
valet
is
certain
that
instead
of
putting
on
his
gloves
he
thrust
them
into
the
pocket
of
his
linen
folcker
says
that
when
his
master
returned
he
took
the
gloves
from
the
pocket
of
the
linen
coat
and
placed
them
on
the
table
in
the
hall
as
was
his
habit
it
was
only
when
the
baron
was
going
out
again
that
he
put
on
the
one
and
then
suddenly
drew
it
off
and
rubbed
his
fingers
the
first
finger
of
his
left
hand
had
undoubtedly
been
cut
and
hence
infected
with
that
substance
which
causes
almost
instant
death
and
the
exact
symptoms
of
heart
disease
orosin
did
you
say
asked
the
head
of
the
amsterdam
police
yes
i
replied
orosin
the
most
dangerous
subtle
and
easily
administered
poison
known
to
our
modern
toxicologists
and
your
great
financier
baron
van
veltrup
has
died
by
the
hand
of
one
who
has
wilfully
administered
it
well
said
the
stolid
man
with
the
scraggy
beard
rather
reluctantly
i
confess
that
this
has
come
to
me
as
a
perfect
revelation
you
have
only
to
order
the
exhumation
of
the
baron
body
and
an
examination
of
the
left
hand
to
be
convinced
that
what
this
englishman
garfield
has
discovered
is
the
actual
truth
declared
doctor
obelt
whose
reputation
as
a
pathologist
was
the
highest
in
the
netherlands
and
against
whose
opinion
even
the
chief
of
police
of
amsterdam
could
raise
no
word
it
shall
be
done
gentlemen
the
stolid
official
assured
us
it
shall
be
done
in
secret
and
at
once
he
was
true
to
his
word
for
at
noon
next
day
i
received
an
invitation
to
call
again
at
the
police
bureau
and
was
there
informed
that
a
small
superficial
cut
upon
the
first
finger
of
the
left
hand
had
been
discovered
therefore
there
was
no
doubt
that
death
had
resulted
from
foul
play
if
such
were
the
case
it
seemed
more
than
probable
that
to
count
de
chamartin
the
intimate
associate
of
oswald
de
gex
a
similar
dose
of
orosin
had
been
administered
chapter
the
more
about
mateo
sanz
the
means
by
which
the
unfortunate
baron
van
veltrup
had
met
with
his
death
was
as
ingenious
as
that
practised
upon
me
by
the
expert
thief
despujol
as
i
reflected
upon
all
the
details
as
related
to
me
by
the
valet
folcker
i
suddenly
recollected
that
the
baron
strange
visitor
the
man
who
must
have
placed
that
sharp
scrap
of
within
his
glove
at
the
moment
when
the
unsuspicious
victim
had
gone
outside
to
speak
with
his
servant
was
described
as
a
man
with
a
red
face
and
a
dark
moustache
a
man
who
answered
such
description
was
the
elusive
friend
of
mademoiselle
jacquelot
of
montauban
the
motor
bandit
mateo
sanz
the
man
who
had
so
cleverly
evaded
the
police
and
who
had
no
doubt
been
an
intimate
friend
of
despujol
in
order
to
confirm
my
suspicions
i
at
once
telegraphed
to
señor
rivero
in
madrid
urging
him
to
send
me
a
copy
of
the
police
photograph
of
sanz
for
identification
purposes
that
same
day
i
received
a
reply
which
informed
me
that
the
photograph
was
in
the
post
hence
i
remained
in
amsterdam
awaiting
its
arrival
four
days
later
it
was
handed
to
me
a
photograph
taken
in
several
positions
of
the
rather
florid
man
whom
i
had
seen
talking
to
mademoiselle
at
the
station
at
montauban
the
man
whom
rivero
had
followed
but
who
on
the
french
police
going
to
arrest
him
was
found
to
have
fled
i
carried
the
photograph
to
folcker
lodgings
and
there
showed
it
to
him
that
is
the
man
who
met
my
master
sir
he
cried
unhesitatingly
only
he
wore
round
horn
spectacles
his
face
and
moustache
are
the
same
he
was
not
dutch
no
this
man
is
a
spaniard
named
sanz
who
is
well
known
to
the
police
i
replied
then
they
should
arrest
him
for
he
is
no
doubt
responsible
for
my
poor
master
death
we
went
together
to
the
bureau
of
police
where
the
valet
formally
identified
the
photograph
and
made
certain
declarations
concerning
the
malefactor
in
question
these
he
signed
i
happen
to
have
seen
this
individual
i
explained
to
the
police
commissary
i
was
with
señor
rivero
head
of
the
spanish
detective
department
and
we
saw
him
at
montauban
but
though
señor
rivero
followed
him
he
escaped
then
he
is
wanted
eh
yes
for
murder
the
dutch
police
official
gave
vent
to
a
low
grunt
very
well
he
said
i
will
have
inquiry
made
i
thank
you
very
much
for
the
information
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
annoyed
because
i
had
dared
to
dispute
his
theory
that
the
late
baron
had
died
from
natural
causes
he
was
a
stolid
man
who
having
once
made
up
his
mind
would
not
hear
any
evidence
to
the
contrary
with
failing
heart
i
saw
that
to
move
him
was
hopeless
so
next
day
i
returned
to
london
piqued
and
angry
yet
satisfied
that
i
had
discovered
the
true
cause
of
the
baron
lamentable
death
weeks
passed
to
pursue
the
inquiry
further
seemed
quite
hopeless
the
summer
went
by
but
tennison
and
her
daughter
still
remained
in
lyons
the
reports
were
never
hopeful
my
poor
darling
was
just
the
same
there
recurred
to
her
ever
and
anon
a
remembrance
of
those
three
colours
which
haunted
her
red
green
and
gold
the
professor
was
most
kind
gabrielle
mother
wrote
me
he
did
everything
in
his
power
and
still
persevered
after
failure
upon
failure
i
fear
poor
gabrielle
will
never
recover
she
wrote
in
one
of
her
letters
the
professor
is
always
optimistic
but
i
can
read
that
in
his
heart
he
has
no
hope
the
next
step
will
i
dread
to
think
be
hopeless
imbecility
with
that
letter
in
my
pocket
i
went
to
the
office
in
westminster
each
day
with
leaden
heart
the
joys
of
life
had
become
blotted
out
i
cared
for
nothing
for
no
one
and
my
interest
in
living
further
had
been
suddenly
swept
away
harry
hambledon
as
we
sat
together
at
breakfast
each
day
tried
in
vain
to
interest
me
in
various
ways
he
urged
me
one
evening
to
go
with
him
and
norah
to
the
palais
de
danse
across
hammersmith
bridge
and
i
was
forced
to
accept
but
instead
of
dancing
i
sat
at
a
side
table
and
sipped
ice
drinks
dancing
had
no
attraction
for
me
very
fortunately
we
were
extremely
busy
at
the
office
four
big
contracts
had
been
entered
into
by
the
firm
for
the
lighting
and
telephones
for
four
new
one
at
bude
in
cornwall
one
in
knightsbridge
another
at
llandudno
in
north
wales
and
the
fourth
at
cromer
hence
i
was
compelled
to
be
ever
on
the
move
between
wales
norfolk
and
cornwall
and
perhaps
this
sudden
activity
prevented
me
from
brooding
too
closely
over
the
hopeless
condition
of
the
girl
with
whom
i
was
so
deeply
in
love
in
these
days
electrical
engineers
have
to
be
pretty
active
in
order
to
pay
their
way
and
though
francis
and
goldsmith
was
an
firm
they
were
nothing
if
not
in
their
methods
one
morning
as
i
sat
in
a
corner
of
the
express
on
my
way
down
to
bude
i
read
in
my
paper
the
following
oswald
de
gex
the
international
financier
is
to
be
entertained
on
thursday
next
to
luncheon
by
the
lord
mayor
and
corporation
at
the
mansion
house
the
prime
ministers
of
spain
and
the
netherlands
who
are
in
london
on
official
business
will
be
included
among
the
guests
de
gex
though
he
has
a
house
in
london
is
seldom
here
he
has
recently
been
engaged
in
a
great
financial
scheme
to
secure
for
england
the
whole
of
the
output
of
the
rich
oil
field
recently
discovered
in
ecuador
so
oswald
de
gex
was
still
in
london
i
held
my
breath
with
his
wall
of
wealth
before
him
he
seemed
invulnerable
i
recollected
those
crisp
bank
of
england
notes
which
still
reposed
in
a
drawer
at
rivermead
mansions
the
bribe
i
had
so
foolishly
accepted
to
become
his
accomplice
in
that
mysterious
crime
gabrielle
engledue
who
was
the
girl
whose
body
because
of
my
false
certificate
had
been
reduced
to
ashes
in
order
to
destroy
all
evidence
of
foul
play
who
was
she
and
what
was
the
motive
if
i
could
only
ascertain
the
latter
then
i
might
be
able
to
reconstruct
the
crime
slowly
piece
by
piece
but
as
far
as
i
could
see
there
was
an
utter
absence
of
motive
long
ago
i
had
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
by
the
death
of
the
unknown
girl
named
engledue
the
unscrupulous
financier
had
added
some
considerable
sum
to
his
bank
balance
but
how
his
crafty
unscrupulousness
was
shown
by
the
manner
in
which
his
partner
to
whom
he
owed
a
big
sum
had
been
cleverly
secretly
killed
by
a
hireling
a
friend
of
the
dead
despujol
oswald
de
gex
posed
to
the
world
as
an
honest
and
upright
man
of
business
whose
financial
aid
was
welcomed
cordially
by
all
the
states
in
europe
he
posed
as
a
philanthropist
and
as
such
earned
a
big
reputation
in
those
countries
in
which
the
operations
of
the
group
he
controlled
were
carried
on
but
i
knew
his
methods
and
i
sat
staggered
at
the
fact
that
the
corporation
of
the
city
of
london
were
about
to
entertain
him
yet
money
counts
always
did
not
the
lord
mayor
and
corporation
once
entertain
the
man
who
gave
a
service
of
gold
to
paul
cathedral
and
who
afterwards
spent
many
years
in
one
of
his
majesty
gaols
my
blood
boiled
within
me
when
i
read
that
announcement
yet
on
calmer
consideration
i
resolved
to
still
wait
and
watch
i
returned
to
london
on
the
following
friday
and
in
the
train
i
read
of
the
splendid
luncheon
given
on
the
previous
day
to
the
and
the
eulogistic
speeches
made
by
two
english
politicians
and
the
two
foreign
premiers
oswald
de
gex
was
declared
to
be
one
of
the
greatest
financiers
of
the
age
and
there
was
a
hint
that
a
certain
allied
government
was
about
to
enlist
his
efforts
with
a
view
to
extricate
it
from
national
bankruptcy
de
gex
was
a
man
who
thought
and
spoke
in
millions
accompanying
the
article
was
a
photograph
of
him
standing
smiling
beside
the
lord
mayor
as
guest
of
the
city
of
london
oswald
de
gex
seldom
allowed
himself
to
be
photographed
but
some
enterprising
press
photographer
had
no
doubt
snapped
him
unawares
his
hesitation
to
be
photographed
public
man
that
he
was
was
but
natural
wherever
you
hear
of
people
in
the
public
eye
male
or
female
who
will
not
allow
their
pictures
to
appear
in
the
papers
you
may
always
suspect
in
that
hesitation
a
dread
of
the
raking
up
of
some
hidden
scandal
many
a
face
which
has
looked
out
upon
us
from
a
pictorial
newspaper
or
a
of
one
daily
journal
has
caused
its
owner
much
terror
and
in
more
than
one
instance
a
rush
into
obscurity
to
avoid
the
police
scotland
yard
and
the
paris
sûreté
have
many
albums
of
photographs
and
it
is
not
generally
known
that
each
day
their
counterparts
are
searched
for
in
the
daily
journals
oswald
de
gex
had
on
that
memorable
day
become
against
his
will
no
doubt
a
lion
of
london
one
heard
nothing
of
de
gex
she
was
still
at
the
villa
clementini
no
doubt
her
name
was
never
mentioned
in
the
very
eulogistic
articles
which
innocent
men
of
fleet
street
penned
concerning
the
man
of
colossal
finance
one
can
never
blame
fleet
street
for
booming
any
man
or
woman
a
couple
of
thousand
pounds
to
a
press
agent
will
secure
for
a
burglar
an
invitation
to
dine
at
a
peer
table
plainly
speaking
in
europe
since
the
war
real
merit
has
become
almost
a
back
number
money
buys
anything
and
anybody
i
fear
that
young
man
as
i
still
am
i
am
a
fierce
critic
of
the
manners
of
our
times
i
learned
my
perhaps
ideas
from
my
father
an
honest
upright
country
parson
who
loved
to
ride
with
the
hounds
who
called
a
spade
a
spade
and
openly
denounced
a
liar
as
such
he
never
minced
matters
and
stuck
to
his
opinion
yet
he
was
a
pious
generous
englishman
who
had
no
use
for
the
international
financier
who
has
lately
become
the
pseudonym
for
a
foreign
adventurer
the
autumn
days
shortened
and
winter
was
approaching
for
the
east
winds
blew
chill
across
the
thames
into
my
room
as
i
shaved
before
my
window
each
morning
tennison
was
still
in
lyons
and
harry
hambledon
went
each
morning
to
his
sordid
work
at
the
hammersmith
police
court
either
prosecuting
or
defending
in
small
cases
his
eloquence
and
shrewdness
as
an
advocate
had
more
than
once
been
commented
upon
by
the
stipendiary
hence
he
was
gradually
working
up
quite
a
lucrative
practice
things
drifted
along
till
the
end
of
october
de
gex
was
living
at
stretton
street
very
occupied
i
ascertained
in
arranging
a
great
development
scheme
for
liberia
that
independent
state
in
west
africa
in
the
city
he
was
constantly
expressing
his
regret
at
the
unfortunate
deaths
of
his
partners
count
de
chamartin
of
madrid
and
the
baron
van
veltrup
of
amsterdam
but
he
had
expressed
himself
ready
to
carry
the
great
deal
through
himself
though
it
involved
the
speculation
of
nearly
two
millions
sterling
i
could
hardly
take
up
any
newspaper
neither
could
you
my
reader
for
that
matter
unless
i
saw
de
gex
referred
to
under
another
name
of
course
he
went
here
and
there
the
guest
of
a
cabinet
minister
playing
golf
with
a
leader
of
the
house
or
spending
a
with
a
duke
until
it
seemed
that
the
world
of
society
had
at
last
prevailed
upon
the
of
millions
to
emerge
from
his
shell
and
take
up
his
position
in
mayfair
when
i
saw
that
he
was
the
guest
of
certain
members
of
the
aristocracy
or
of
war
profiteers
who
dropping
their
aitches
had
bought
ancestral
homes
i
merely
smiled
at
the
ignorance
of
those
who
were
entertaining
one
of
the
greatest
criminals
in
europe
in
the
watch
i
kept
each
evening
upon
the
house
in
stretton
street
my
friend
harry
hambledon
assisted
me
as
we
lurked
in
doorways
in
the
vicinity
we
saw
the
great
ones
of
london
society
of
both
sexes
going
and
coming
for
oswald
de
gex
had
now
commenced
to
entertain
upon
a
lavish
scale
he
gave
smart
and
musical
evenings
which
the
most
exclusive
set
enjoyed
one
night
after
it
had
grown
dark
i
sauntered
along
park
lane
as
was
my
habit
and
having
turned
into
stretton
street
noticed
a
rather
shabbily
dressed
man
evidently
a
foreigner
descending
the
steps
from
de
gex
door
he
turned
in
my
direction
and
we
came
face
to
face
in
an
instant
i
recognized
him
as
the
spaniard
mateo
sanz
he
had
never
seen
me
before
therefore
when
at
a
respectable
distance
i
turned
and
followed
him
along
to
a
street
off
the
edgware
road
where
he
entered
a
private
hotel
what
i
wondered
was
his
object
in
visiting
de
gex
unless
some
other
plot
was
in
progress
i
however
did
not
intend
now
that
i
knew
the
truth
concerning
the
death
of
the
baron
in
amsterdam
that
the
assassin
should
escape
hence
i
took
a
taxi
to
scotland
yard
where
i
was
interviewed
by
a
to
whom
i
revealed
the
of
the
criminal
he
thanked
me
and
then
began
to
inquire
what
i
knew
concerning
him
in
return
i
told
him
of
my
friendship
with
the
great
spanish
detective
rivero
and
how
with
the
latter
i
had
seen
sanz
at
the
station
at
montauban
presently
he
rose
and
telling
me
he
would
search
for
any
request
from
the
spanish
government
for
the
man
arrest
he
left
me
he
returned
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
with
some
papers
in
his
hands
and
said
i
find
that
the
madrid
police
have
applied
to
us
for
this
individual
arrest
and
here
is
his
photograph
and
he
showed
me
one
similar
to
that
which
rivero
had
sent
me
to
amsterdam
i
of
course
made
no
mention
of
oswald
de
gex
but
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
if
sanz
were
arrested
de
gex
might
take
fright
so
i
suggested
that
the
spaniard
be
kept
under
surveillance
until
the
spanish
police
were
communicated
with
i
believe
señor
rivero
suspects
that
sanz
is
one
of
a
very
dangerous
gang
i
said
if
so
it
would
be
well
to
arrest
them
all
are
the
others
in
london
do
you
think
asked
the
tall
official
of
the
criminal
investigation
department
ah
that
i
do
not
know
was
my
reply
i
only
know
that
mateo
sanz
is
a
very
dangerous
person
who
has
been
wanted
for
several
years
well
we
thank
you
very
much
for
your
information
sir
and
we
shall
act
upon
it
at
once
he
replied
and
then
i
went
along
the
stone
corridor
and
out
again
into
parliament
street
well
satisfied
that
i
had
at
last
placed
one
of
the
criminals
in
the
hands
of
the
police
who
would
in
due
course
learn
the
true
facts
concerning
baron
van
veltrup
mysterious
end
chapter
the
a
curious
story
at
scotland
yard
they
acted
upon
my
suggestion
and
at
once
sent
a
wireless
message
to
señor
rivero
in
madrid
telling
him
of
the
discovery
of
the
notorious
mateo
sanz
in
the
meantime
my
curiosity
was
further
aroused
by
a
note
sent
to
me
by
tennison
servant
alford
next
day
saying
that
doctor
moroni
had
called
at
longridge
road
and
that
finding
miss
gabrielle
absent
he
had
put
to
her
a
number
of
questions
concerning
myself
as
i
promised
you
sir
the
woman
wrote
i
pleaded
ignorance
of
everything
he
was
apparently
astonished
to
find
my
mistress
and
miss
gabrielle
away
he
asked
me
for
their
address
but
i
replied
that
they
were
moving
from
place
to
place
on
the
continent
he
seemed
most
annoyed
and
went
away
i
wondered
what
was
his
object
in
going
to
longridge
road
if
not
for
the
purpose
of
some
further
evil
work
though
he
pretended
friendliness
towards
gabrielle
yet
i
knew
that
he
was
her
enemy
just
as
he
was
mine
moroni
was
in
london
hence
he
would
no
doubt
visit
de
gex
hambledon
was
unknown
to
moroni
therefore
he
watched
in
stretton
street
on
the
following
night
and
in
his
work
of
observation
he
was
assisted
by
norah
who
had
been
told
something
of
the
strange
circumstances
though
of
course
not
the
whole
amazing
story
just
before
eleven
harry
and
his
fiancée
arrived
at
rivermead
mansions
in
a
taxi
and
told
me
that
they
had
seen
moroni
arrive
at
stretton
street
about
nine
he
was
admitted
by
a
new
and
rather
supercilious
for
horton
did
not
now
seem
to
be
in
the
great
man
employ
ten
minutes
afterwards
suzor
arrived
harry
said
then
about
half
an
hour
later
moroni
came
out
i
was
passing
the
house
slowly
when
he
came
down
the
steps
muttering
fiercely
to
himself
in
italian
norah
said
he
took
no
notice
of
me
for
he
seemed
extremely
angry
and
excited
indeed
as
he
left
he
glanced
back
at
the
house
his
hands
clenched
and
he
seemed
to
invoke
a
curse
upon
it
by
jove
i
gasped
that
interesting
the
precious
trio
have
perhaps
quarrelled
perhaps
said
hambledon
and
as
a
lawyer
i
venture
to
predict
that
if
they
really
have
we
shall
ere
long
obtain
some
very
interesting
disclosures
norah
stayed
and
had
some
supper
for
we
were
all
desperately
hungry
and
later
on
harry
saw
her
back
to
richmond
three
days
later
in
consequence
of
a
message
sent
to
me
from
the
hotel
cecil
i
went
home
early
from
the
office
to
rivermead
mansions
and
had
only
been
in
five
minutes
when
the
rang
on
opening
it
i
found
my
expected
visitor
señor
rivero
ah
my
dear
friend
cried
the
police
official
as
he
wrung
my
hand
warmly
so
i
have
found
you
at
last
the
made
a
mistake
in
the
address
and
took
me
further
down
the
road
well
so
you
have
been
doing
good
business
for
us
eh
you
have
found
mateo
sanz
yes
i
recognized
him
i
said
i
have
just
been
with
superintendent
risden
of
scotland
yard
and
we
have
seen
our
friend
whom
we
have
wanted
for
so
long
he
is
quite
unsuspicious
but
i
am
told
that
two
days
ago
he
visited
the
house
of
de
gex
yes
he
is
his
friend
just
as
despujol
was
i
remarked
but
i
can
not
understand
that
rivero
declared
it
seems
incredible
that
a
person
of
such
high
standing
as
de
gex
should
number
bandits
among
his
friends
i
revealed
to
you
the
truth
concerning
de
gex
when
we
were
in
nîmes
i
said
even
then
you
were
half
inclined
to
disbelieve
it
now
you
know
the
truth
the
two
business
partners
of
oswald
de
gex
the
conde
de
chamartin
of
madrid
and
the
baron
van
veltrup
of
amsterdam
have
both
died
suddenly
and
at
the
instigation
of
their
unsuspected
friend
it
has
been
proved
that
sanz
introduced
the
tiny
scrap
of
infected
into
the
baron
glove
at
de
gex
instigation
impossible
de
gex
was
the
only
person
to
profit
by
the
baron
death
i
pointed
out
he
owed
a
large
sum
to
the
baron
over
a
financial
deal
and
by
the
latter
death
and
the
destruction
of
certain
papers
he
now
escapes
payment
but
you
surely
do
not
allege
that
de
gex
resorts
to
the
use
of
this
little
known
and
unsuspected
poison
in
order
to
secure
his
own
ends
cried
the
famous
detective
as
he
sat
opposite
me
in
an
when
we
know
the
truth
as
i
hope
we
may
very
soon
then
you
will
be
staggered
i
assured
him
at
present
you
do
not
know
the
whole
of
the
amazing
story
for
certain
private
reasons
i
have
been
unable
to
reveal
it
to
you
but
slowly
piece
by
piece
i
have
been
steadily
working
upon
the
mystery
of
certain
amazing
occurrences
at
de
house
in
stretton
street
by
slow
degrees
and
after
travelling
up
and
down
europe
i
have
at
last
succeeded
in
finding
just
a
streak
of
daylight
through
the
impenetrable
barrier
so
cleverly
contrived
in
order
to
mystify
and
mislead
me
if
you
desire
to
ascertain
the
great
ramifications
of
the
desperate
plots
conceived
by
de
gex
and
his
friends
and
take
steps
to
combat
them
it
will
be
best
to
allow
his
accomplice
sanz
further
liberty
keep
vigilant
watch
but
do
not
allow
him
to
suspect
i
urged
he
will
no
doubt
go
to
stretton
street
again
sanz
though
a
hired
assassin
as
was
his
friend
despujol
should
not
be
arrested
yet
for
the
longer
he
remains
at
liberty
the
more
extensive
will
be
our
information
against
the
of
europe
oswald
de
gex
rivero
spent
the
evening
with
me
we
dined
at
the
clarendon
across
hammersmith
bridge
and
afterwards
we
idled
in
one
of
the
foreign
cafés
near
piccadilly
circus
he
was
in
london
with
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
mateo
sanz
in
his
pocket
but
at
my
suggestion
he
stayed
his
hand
meanwhile
sanz
all
unsuspecting
was
being
carefully
watched
not
only
by
two
from
scotland
yard
but
also
by
two
spanish
detectives
whom
rivero
had
brought
to
london
with
him
two
days
later
in
response
to
a
message
from
rivero
i
called
at
the
hotel
cecil
on
leaving
the
office
he
met
me
in
the
entrance
hall
and
i
noticed
at
once
a
grave
expression
upon
his
face
come
up
to
my
room
he
said
in
french
we
can
talk
quietly
there
in
surprise
i
went
with
him
up
in
the
lift
to
the
third
floor
where
in
a
bedroom
which
overlooked
the
embankment
and
the
thames
beyond
he
turned
suddenly
to
me
and
exclaimed
still
in
french
i
am
very
troubled
and
mystified
monsieur
garfield
when
you
made
those
curious
allegations
against
monsieur
de
gex
i
confess
that
i
laughed
them
to
scorn
but
i
have
learned
several
facts
which
put
an
entirely
fresh
complexion
upon
the
present
circumstances
last
night
mateo
sanz
visited
de
gex
again
the
financier
gave
a
musical
evening
but
after
the
departure
of
all
the
guests
sanz
called
and
was
at
once
admitted
to
de
gex
library
ah
i
exclaimed
i
know
that
room
i
have
sad
cause
to
remember
it
he
remained
there
till
nearly
two
in
the
morning
then
he
returned
on
foot
to
his
hotel
my
information
is
that
on
his
walk
back
he
was
whistling
to
himself
as
though
in
high
spirits
but
that
is
surely
no
extraordinary
circumstance
i
remarked
did
i
not
tell
you
that
de
gex
is
as
friendly
with
sanz
as
he
was
with
despujol
i
know
but
in
face
of
other
facts
i
have
learnt
the
problem
presented
is
an
amazing
one
as
he
spoke
a
tap
came
upon
the
door
and
a
handed
in
a
card
show
the
gentleman
up
rivero
said
in
his
broken
english
here
is
someone
who
will
relate
some
very
strange
facts
he
is
my
friend
gonzalez
maura
an
advocate
who
practised
in
madrid
before
his
appointment
to
our
consulate
here
i
called
at
the
consulate
yesterday
and
saw
him
when
he
related
to
me
some
curious
facts
which
i
have
asked
him
to
repeat
to
you
he
is
here
for
that
purpose
a
few
moments
later
the
ushered
in
a
man
who
bowed
elegantly
when
we
were
introduced
now
my
dear
friend
exclaimed
rivero
when
we
were
all
three
seated
will
you
please
tell
garfield
what
you
explained
to
me
yesterday
certainly
i
merely
tell
you
what
i
know
he
replied
in
very
fair
english
it
is
like
this
before
i
left
madrid
i
was
very
friendly
with
a
country
lawyer
named
ruiz
serrano
who
lived
at
valladolid
for
some
reason
the
late
count
de
chamartin
took
a
great
fancy
to
my
friend
and
constituted
him
his
legal
adviser
an
appointment
which
brought
him
in
quite
a
large
income
to
the
lawyer
of
a
great
financier
fees
are
always
rolling
in
the
count
naturally
took
serrano
into
his
confidence
and
told
him
how
years
ago
he
had
married
the
daughter
of
an
englishman
in
rather
humble
circumstances
living
in
madrid
a
daughter
was
born
to
them
but
later
he
divorced
his
wife
who
died
soon
afterwards
and
then
he
married
a
lady
of
the
madrid
aristocracy
the
present
widow
apparently
he
made
a
will
leaving
the
whole
of
his
fortune
to
his
daughter
by
his
first
wife
save
for
a
small
annuity
to
his
second
wife
and
according
to
the
will
on
the
death
of
his
daughter
the
fortune
was
to
go
to
his
trusted
partner
your
english
financier
oswald
de
gex
i
sat
staring
at
the
stranger
but
uttered
no
word
for
i
was
reflecting
deeply
señor
serrano
arrived
in
london
a
week
ago
and
came
to
consult
me
regarding
the
will
because
it
seems
that
the
count
daughter
who
came
here
to
learn
english
she
having
lived
in
madrid
all
her
life
is
dead
hence
de
gex
has
inherited
the
count
fortune
i
gasped
what
was
the
girl
name
her
name
was
of
course
chamartin
but
in
obedience
to
her
wish
after
the
divorce
she
took
her
mother
maiden
name
and
was
known
as
gabrielle
engledue
gabrielle
engledue
i
echoed
engledue
chapter
the
love
the
conqueror
the
sudden
revelation
of
the
motive
of
the
crime
at
stretton
street
staggered
me
an
hour
later
i
saw
the
count
lawyer
señor
serrano
at
his
hotel
in
russell
square
and
from
him
learned
much
more
regarding
his
late
client
disposition
of
his
property
the
count
had
apparently
not
been
on
very
affectionate
terms
with
his
second
wife
which
accounted
for
him
leaving
the
bulk
of
his
fortune
to
his
daughter
gabrielle
and
in
case
of
her
death
to
his
partner
de
gex
whom
he
had
of
course
believed
to
be
an
honest
man
the
count
had
died
suddenly
several
months
before
his
daughter
he
had
died
from
orosin
no
doubt
administered
by
someone
in
de
gex
pay
then
almost
before
the
will
could
be
proved
in
the
girl
favour
señor
serrano
learned
that
the
girl
herself
had
died
in
england
since
then
he
had
been
constantly
occupied
in
straightening
out
his
late
client
affairs
and
had
now
come
to
london
for
the
first
time
in
order
to
see
oswald
de
gex
who
had
been
constantly
pressing
for
a
settlement
of
the
estate
he
had
seen
him
on
the
previous
day
when
he
appeared
to
be
anxious
that
the
affair
should
be
cleared
up
as
he
spoke
of
his
late
partner
and
of
his
daughter
tears
came
to
his
eyes
said
the
spanish
lawyer
speaking
in
french
tears
in
the
eyes
of
oswald
de
gex
i
smiled
at
the
thought
as
for
rivero
he
now
became
just
as
puzzled
as
i
was
myself
to
me
the
motive
of
poor
gabrielle
engledue
death
was
now
quite
apparent
and
moreover
it
seemed
that
the
reason
de
gex
required
a
forged
death
certificate
was
because
he
was
not
exactly
certain
whether
by
a
examination
any
trace
of
the
drug
could
be
found
he
was
not
quite
sure
that
one
or
other
of
the
great
london
pathologists
might
not
identify
orosin
with
the
count
death
on
the
continent
he
had
taken
the
risk
well
knowing
that
any
ordinary
doctor
would
pronounce
death
as
being
due
to
heart
failure
as
indeed
it
was
in
london
however
he
felt
impelled
to
take
precautions
and
they
were
very
elaborate
and
cunning
ones
as
i
now
knew
with
the
motive
thus
apparent
i
felt
myself
on
the
verge
of
triumph
yet
without
full
knowledge
of
what
occurred
to
my
poor
beloved
on
that
night
how
could
i
denounce
the
whose
favours
were
now
being
sought
by
the
great
ones
of
the
land
i
was
still
in
a
quandary
i
had
established
to
my
own
satisfaction
that
tito
moroni
the
doctor
of
the
via
cavezzo
was
the
person
who
had
distilled
the
orosin
and
who
had
no
doubt
introduced
it
to
his
wealthy
but
unscrupulous
patient
as
a
means
of
ridding
himself
of
unwanted
persons
and
enriching
himself
at
the
same
time
indeed
these
facts
were
eventually
proved
up
to
the
hilt
the
motives
for
the
deaths
of
the
conde
de
chamartin
his
daughter
and
the
philanthropic
dutch
financier
were
all
quite
plain
but
of
course
i
had
said
nothing
to
rivero
or
to
anybody
else
regarding
my
acceptance
of
a
bribe
to
assist
de
gex
in
the
committal
of
a
crime
i
confess
that
on
that
night
of
horror
i
had
no
suspicion
of
foul
play
for
knowing
the
great
financier
as
a
person
of
very
high
standing
i
naturally
believed
the
story
of
his
niece
sudden
death
it
was
not
until
i
found
myself
in
the
hospital
at
malo
that
i
realized
how
cleverly
i
had
been
tricked
the
drug
had
been
administered
to
me
in
just
sufficient
dose
to
ensure
that
my
brain
should
be
affected
and
that
any
story
i
might
afterwards
tell
should
be
discredited
happily
however
i
had
now
nearly
completely
recovered
i
was
the
third
person
known
to
return
to
their
normal
senses
after
a
dose
of
orosin
would
there
be
a
fourth
three
further
days
went
past
watchful
anxious
days
de
gex
was
still
at
stretton
street
apparently
quite
unconscious
that
his
hireling
sanz
was
being
kept
under
close
surveillance
another
plot
was
in
progress
without
a
doubt
twice
again
had
the
elusive
spaniard
who
was
such
a
close
friend
of
the
notorious
despujol
visited
stretton
street
it
seemed
too
that
de
gex
though
anxious
to
return
to
italy
still
remained
in
london
in
the
hope
that
señor
serrano
would
arrange
for
the
immediate
transfer
of
the
count
property
one
could
scarcely
take
up
a
newspaper
without
finding
that
oswald
de
gex
had
attended
this
function
or
that
for
he
was
apparently
courting
the
favours
of
certain
high
political
personages
no
doubt
with
a
view
to
a
place
in
the
next
honours
list
i
smiled
within
myself
as
i
read
of
all
the
great
man
doings
of
his
vast
financial
interests
of
his
estates
in
england
and
in
italy
and
his
assistance
to
the
ministry
of
finance
of
spain
often
indeed
when
at
home
i
discussed
the
situation
with
hambledon
yet
without
the
evidence
of
gabrielle
tennison
we
could
not
act
nearly
a
week
had
passed
since
my
first
meeting
with
the
spanish
lawyer
serrano
tito
moroni
had
apparently
returned
to
italy
for
he
had
not
been
again
to
stretton
street
his
last
visit
there
had
no
doubt
resulted
in
a
quarrel
with
his
wealthy
client
whom
i
had
suspicions
he
was
blackmailing
for
such
would
undoubtedly
be
the
procedure
of
a
blackguard
of
his
calibre
more
than
once
rivero
seemed
anxious
to
secure
the
arrest
of
mateo
sanz
but
i
constantly
urged
him
to
remain
patient
he
frequently
begged
me
to
reveal
the
true
extent
of
my
knowledge
but
i
always
evaded
his
questions
because
i
was
not
yet
in
a
position
to
make
a
triumphant
coup
and
avenge
poor
gabrielle
daily
hourly
indeed
was
she
in
my
thoughts
the
letters
i
received
from
lyons
were
the
reverse
of
hopeful
the
last
one
indeed
reported
that
little
or
no
progress
had
been
noted
during
the
weeks
she
had
been
under
the
care
of
the
kindly
old
professor
one
evening
on
returning
from
the
office
i
found
upon
the
a
note
in
tennison
hand
it
had
been
written
from
longridge
road
a
few
hours
before
and
in
it
she
asked
me
to
call
that
evening
as
they
had
returned
from
france
naturally
i
lost
no
time
in
dashing
over
to
earl
court
and
with
failing
heart
i
entered
the
artistic
little
where
gabrielle
herself
in
a
cool
frock
of
cream
washing
silk
trimmed
with
narrow
edgings
of
jade
green
rose
smiling
to
greet
me
her
face
was
changed
for
her
countenance
was
now
bright
and
vivacious
and
her
eyes
merry
and
sparkling
the
hard
set
expression
had
gone
and
she
looked
very
alert
and
indescribably
sweet
well
mr
garfield
she
cried
merrily
shaking
my
hand
in
warm
welcome
so
different
from
her
usual
apathetic
attitude
towards
me
you
see
we
back
again
mother
has
just
gone
round
to
aunt
in
cromwell
road
but
she
told
me
that
you
would
call
well
miss
tennison
i
exclaimed
holding
her
soft
little
hand
in
mine
and
looking
into
her
eyes
i
hope
i
hope
that
you
feel
better
indeed
you
look
quite
changed
yes
i
can
recollect
everything
now
all
the
past
has
come
back
to
me
thanks
to
the
old
professor
he
was
so
very
kind
and
so
patient
that
i
can
never
thank
him
sufficiently
or
you
garfield
for
discovering
him
i
feel
quite
myself
again
and
it
was
all
so
sudden
at
first
the
treatment
gave
me
no
relief
my
brain
seemed
so
muddled
but
quite
suddenly
one
day
i
found
that
i
could
recollect
the
past
all
that
happened
to
me
on
that
terrible
night
and
in
three
days
the
professor
announced
that
i
had
quite
recovered
my
heart
leapt
with
joy
she
was
cured
cured
tell
me
all
that
you
recollect
regarding
the
events
of
that
night
i
urged
breathlessly
as
we
sat
together
in
the
little
london
i
looked
at
her
countenance
and
realized
now
that
it
was
full
of
life
and
animation
how
very
beautiful
she
was
how
different
from
when
i
had
seen
her
half
dragged
along
the
streets
of
florence
by
her
pretended
friend
moroni
but
justice
was
at
hand
so
i
urged
her
to
tell
me
exactly
what
happened
i
give
it
to
you
my
reader
in
my
love
own
words
just
as
she
related
it
to
me
well
she
said
drawing
a
long
breath
one
night
about
twelve
months
ago
i
was
at
a
private
dance
at
the
house
of
a
friend
in
holland
park
when
i
was
introduced
to
a
young
married
woman
named
cullerton
the
wife
of
a
man
on
the
stock
exchange
i
rather
liked
her
and
as
she
invited
me
to
a
small
dance
which
she
gave
a
week
later
we
soon
became
friends
one
day
while
we
were
walking
together
in
bond
street
we
met
de
gex
the
great
financier
to
whom
she
introduced
me
his
car
was
standing
at
the
kerb
so
he
took
us
back
to
tea
at
his
house
in
stretton
street
while
we
were
at
tea
a
tall
dark
girl
came
in
and
was
introduced
to
us
as
gabrielle
engledue
as
we
sat
at
tea
we
laughed
over
the
similarity
of
our
names
and
she
told
me
that
though
her
mother
had
been
english
she
had
lived
all
her
life
in
madrid
and
had
been
over
here
for
the
purpose
of
studying
english
she
had
been
staying
with
a
family
somewhere
in
essex
but
was
now
at
an
hotel
in
london
for
she
was
returning
to
madrid
in
a
few
days
i
rather
liked
her
and
as
de
gex
was
charming
to
us
both
i
accepted
his
invitation
to
dine
there
a
few
days
later
i
did
not
tell
mother
about
this
for
i
feared
that
being
rather
she
might
disapprove
of
my
new
friendships
we
had
a
delightful
dinner
and
de
gex
took
us
all
three
to
the
theatre
afterwards
and
drove
each
of
us
home
i
was
the
first
and
he
put
me
down
at
the
corner
of
earl
court
road
on
the
night
of
november
the
seventh
at
very
short
notice
de
gex
had
again
invited
miss
engledue
and
myself
through
cullerton
to
dinner
for
she
was
leaving
for
madrid
next
day
her
luggage
having
already
been
sent
to
the
station
she
told
me
we
understood
that
and
cullerton
were
also
coming
we
did
not
put
on
as
de
gex
said
he
intended
to
take
us
to
a
show
at
olympia
afterwards
i
was
i
know
foolish
not
to
tell
mother
where
i
was
going
but
the
reason
for
it
i
have
already
explained
when
i
arrived
at
stretton
street
after
my
dancing
lesson
gabrielle
engledue
was
already
there
chatting
with
de
gex
in
the
library
he
told
me
that
he
had
just
received
a
telephone
message
from
cullerton
saying
that
his
wife
had
been
taken
rather
unwell
and
therefore
could
not
come
so
we
three
sat
down
the
only
other
guest
being
a
man
i
now
recollect
as
one
who
afterwards
proved
my
friend
doctor
moroni
the
meal
was
quite
a
merry
one
for
de
gex
was
quite
a
lady
man
when
his
wife
was
absent
at
that
time
i
understood
that
de
gex
was
remaining
in
italy
the
meal
was
served
by
a
man
whom
the
great
financier
addressed
as
horton
and
just
before
coffee
was
brought
in
i
recollect
that
moroni
left
the
table
and
went
to
the
telephone
then
on
his
return
the
man
horton
brought
in
the
cups
which
were
already
filled
the
man
put
down
a
cup
before
me
but
de
gex
noticing
that
it
was
a
little
too
full
politely
exchanged
his
for
mine
we
were
chatting
and
de
gex
had
just
said
that
it
was
about
time
we
were
off
to
olympia
when
i
sipped
my
coffee
i
noticed
that
both
doctor
moroni
and
our
host
glanced
at
me
curiously
the
coffee
tasted
unusually
sweet
and
also
it
seemed
to
be
slightly
perfumed
i
remember
almost
like
i
had
just
replaced
the
cup
upon
the
table
when
i
felt
a
most
violent
pain
in
my
head
and
cried
out
miss
engledue
was
at
my
side
in
an
instant
but
i
felt
a
sensation
of
giddiness
and
next
moment
i
knew
nothing
more
i
remained
silent
for
a
few
seconds
thinking
deeply
over
her
remarkable
story
then
miss
engledue
was
quite
well
at
the
time
i
asked
quite
she
sprang
to
my
assistance
then
you
were
taken
ill
before
she
became
similarly
affected
was
she
i
did
not
know
that
said
my
beloved
in
surprise
yes
you
were
rendered
unconscious
by
a
drug
which
produced
all
the
symptoms
of
death
but
miss
engledue
was
afterwards
deliberately
killed
gabrielle
stared
at
me
as
though
she
believed
that
i
was
bereft
of
my
senses
was
gabrielle
engledue
killed
she
gasped
surely
she
was
not
she
was
i
replied
and
her
body
was
afterwards
cremated
my
beloved
gave
vent
to
a
shriek
of
horror
and
what
more
natural
she
now
realized
for
the
first
time
that
she
had
been
the
victim
of
a
clever
and
amazing
plot
i
recollect
she
said
that
just
at
the
moment
of
my
sudden
seizure
i
seemed
to
become
fascinated
by
the
gorgeous
spanish
shawl
which
gabrielle
engledue
had
around
her
shoulders
it
was
a
most
beautifully
embroidered
silk
shawl
with
long
heavy
fringe
and
flowers
worked
in
red
green
and
gold
upon
a
silk
fabric
i
had
been
admiring
it
all
the
time
i
sat
at
the
table
but
the
colours
seemed
so
dazzling
as
to
bewilder
me
to
muddle
my
senses
red
green
and
gold
how
often
had
those
words
of
hers
puzzled
me
now
i
knew
the
truth
that
magnificent
spanish
shawl
had
stood
out
in
her
recollection
as
the
last
object
she
had
seen
before
the
deadly
orosin
had
done
its
work
then
i
told
her
my
own
story
i
was
inveigled
by
a
specious
story
into
that
house
soon
after
you
had
sipped
your
coffee
perhaps
even
before
i
said
the
library
was
filled
with
a
curious
overpowering
perfume
of
which
overcame
me
and
then
de
gex
gave
me
a
liqueur
glass
of
brandy
into
which
there
had
been
introduced
that
most
baneful
of
all
drugs
orosin
it
took
immediate
effect
upon
me
and
a
few
moments
later
i
was
shown
you
lying
upon
the
bed
as
though
you
were
dead
indeed
i
believed
you
to
be
dead
and
in
the
muddled
state
of
my
brain
i
actually
gave
a
certificate
with
which
that
fiend
de
gex
had
already
provided
himself
i
declared
that
you
had
died
of
heart
disease
a
malady
for
which
i
had
for
some
months
treated
you
but
i
knew
nothing
more
until
i
was
found
on
the
road
in
hampshire
she
said
and
i
knew
nothing
more
until
i
found
myself
in
a
hospital
over
at
malo
i
went
on
the
drug
orosin
in
small
doses
destroys
the
memory
in
large
doses
it
produces
an
effect
of
death
and
in
still
larger
ones
like
that
administered
to
your
friend
the
girl
miss
engledue
causes
instant
death
with
no
symptoms
that
the
can
distinguish
other
than
the
natural
cause
of
sudden
heart
failure
was
i
given
the
drug
deliberately
asked
gabrielle
looking
at
me
with
her
wonderful
eyes
eyes
so
different
from
those
dulled
fixed
ones
which
i
had
seen
in
the
duomo
in
old
florence
when
she
had
raised
herself
from
praying
in
her
state
while
the
sinister
italian
doctor
stood
behind
her
yes
i
said
de
gex
passed
his
coffee
cup
to
you
smiling
and
without
compunction
well
knowing
the
effect
it
must
have
upon
you
at
the
same
time
his
intention
being
to
kill
your
friend
miss
engledue
by
administering
a
stronger
dose
this
must
have
been
accomplished
by
the
infection
of
some
wound
or
slight
abrasion
of
the
skin
so
that
the
drug
should
be
introduced
directly
into
the
system
and
not
by
the
mouth
such
a
method
would
cause
almost
instant
death
but
did
gabrielle
engledue
die
she
asked
excitedly
yes
she
did
and
by
her
death
de
gex
inherits
the
fortune
of
her
father
a
rich
spaniard
the
conde
de
chamartin
she
looked
at
me
utterly
bewildered
and
well
the
poor
girl
might
be
she
now
realized
that
she
had
been
the
victim
of
an
amazing
plot
conceived
by
a
master
criminal
who
was
at
the
same
time
immensely
wealthy
yet
who
cared
nothing
for
human
life
so
long
as
he
amassed
a
colossal
fortune
all
this
garfield
is
most
astounding
she
declared
gazing
with
bewilderment
around
the
room
it
seems
incredible
yes
miss
tennison
i
know
it
does
i
replied
but
have
patience
and
i
will
prove
to
you
the
true
depth
of
the
villainy
of
our
mutual
enemy
and
his
sycophants
then
of
a
sudden
i
grasped
her
soft
hand
in
mine
and
for
a
few
seconds
held
it
i
looked
steadily
into
her
wonderful
eyes
and
then
slowly
i
raised
her
hand
to
my
lips
and
kissed
it
gabrielle
i
whispered
bending
to
her
in
deep
earnestness
my
triumph
over
your
enemies
is
yours
wait
and
i
will
reveal
to
you
the
whole
facts
facts
more
astounding
than
have
ever
been
conceived
in
the
most
sensational
pages
of
modern
fiction
she
did
not
withdraw
her
hand
and
by
her
inert
attitude
i
realized
with
indescribable
joy
that
she
really
reciprocated
my
love
i
am
not
an
emotional
man
neither
am
i
an
ideal
lover
i
am
only
a
mere
hence
perhaps
the
reader
will
forgive
me
if
i
fail
to
describe
all
the
ecstasy
of
affection
which
i
experienced
at
that
moment
i
loved
gabrielle
tennison
with
all
my
soul
and
i
now
knew
that
she
loved
me
that
surely
was
with
gabrielle
i
had
been
a
of
a
deeply
laid
and
most
foul
plot
that
i
had
been
purposely
marked
down
with
the
aid
of
de
gex
accomplice
and
sycophant
gaston
suzor
was
made
more
than
plain
as
i
pursued
my
inquiries
the
plot
by
which
de
gex
had
hoped
to
secure
his
partner
fortune
was
indeed
worthy
the
evil
mind
of
the
of
europe
the
man
whose
unseen
influence
made
itself
felt
in
every
great
political
move
on
the
continent
the
man
whose
hundred
agents
were
ready
in
secret
to
do
his
bidding
and
perform
any
dirty
work
for
payment
after
the
conde
de
chamartin
had
been
secretly
attacked
in
the
train
on
his
way
to
paris
and
had
died
in
the
hospital
at
san
sebastian
oswald
de
gex
suddenly
found
to
his
dismay
that
whatever
claim
he
made
upon
his
late
partner
estate
practically
the
whole
would
go
to
his
daughter
therefore
while
being
a
little
apprehensive
lest
orosin
could
be
detected
in
a
body
after
death
by
an
expert
pathologist
he
resorted
to
that
elaborate
and
remarkable
plot
in
order
to
exhibit
to
me
what
i
presumed
to
be
the
body
of
gabrielle
engledue
and
induce
me
to
forge
a
death
certificate
in
the
name
of
a
doctor
whose
surname
was
the
same
as
my
own
the
fact
that
he
had
actually
provided
himself
with
a
genuine
sheet
of
the
doctor
notepaper
and
that
as
i
now
learnt
for
the
first
time
moroni
was
actually
in
the
house
when
the
drug
was
given
to
gabrielle
and
myself
prior
to
the
death
of
the
chief
victim
showed
the
utter
callousness
of
the
crime
indeed
gabrielle
engledue
was
actually
witness
of
my
beloved
mysterious
seizure
little
dreaming
that
in
a
short
hour
she
herself
would
fall
victim
to
the
cupidity
of
that
relentless
poisoner
who
by
his
crimes
hoped
to
amass
one
of
the
most
colossal
fortunes
in
the
world
i
sat
with
gabrielle
discussing
the
amazing
affair
until
darkness
slowly
fell
i
told
her
of
my
own
astounding
adventures
and
my
narrow
escape
from
death
in
madrid
to
all
of
which
she
listened
with
breathless
interest
then
rising
i
took
her
hand
again
and
with
whispered
words
i
pressed
my
lips
to
hers
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
but
sacred
caress
she
sighed
i
felt
her
quiver
as
i
pressed
her
to
me
and
then
to
my
delight
i
felt
her
sweet
warm
lips
cling
at
last
affectionately
to
mine
chapter
the
another
plot
among
my
letters
on
the
following
morning
was
a
small
packet
which
i
opened
within
was
a
tablet
of
bearing
the
name
of
a
firm
of
manufacturers
with
it
was
a
typewritten
letter
upon
commercial
paper
with
a
printed
heading
i
was
addressed
as
granfield
and
the
letter
proved
to
be
a
polite
intimation
that
as
the
firm
in
question
was
putting
on
to
the
market
a
new
brand
of
they
begged
me
to
accept
with
their
compliments
the
enclosed
sample
i
was
also
informed
that
if
i
liked
it
i
could
purchase
it
of
their
agents
a
certain
firm
of
chemists
in
king
street
hammersmith
looks
rather
decent
soap
remarked
harry
as
i
passed
it
to
him
and
then
i
it
in
its
paper
and
placed
it
aside
at
eleven
i
sat
with
rivero
gabrielle
and
harry
hambledon
in
the
dull
at
scotland
yard
that
same
room
wherein
i
had
given
information
concerning
the
whereabouts
of
mateo
sanz
the
superintendent
who
received
us
was
a
courtly
man
rather
stout
and
elderly
who
became
intensely
interested
when
i
related
the
whole
story
much
as
i
have
set
it
down
in
the
foregoing
pages
the
consultation
was
a
momentous
one
rivero
sat
amazed
when
i
described
my
chance
meeting
with
gaston
suzor
and
the
clever
manner
in
which
i
had
been
inveigled
into
de
gex
house
in
stretton
street
indeed
on
comparing
gabrielle
story
with
my
own
i
now
saw
that
at
the
time
i
entered
the
house
both
she
and
the
girl
engledue
were
in
their
normal
health
the
coffee
had
not
then
been
served
though
moroni
had
gone
out
of
the
room
no
doubt
to
put
the
drug
into
the
cup
which
was
to
be
offered
to
gabrielle
tennison
and
which
apparently
was
placed
by
mistake
before
the
himself
or
else
the
changing
of
the
cups
was
to
allay
any
suspicion
that
might
arise
in
the
mind
of
the
other
victim
which
was
perhaps
most
likely
according
to
gabrielle
it
seemed
that
at
the
moment
of
her
seizure
horton
the
room
and
said
some
words
in
a
low
tone
to
his
master
whereupon
the
latter
rose
left
the
table
and
evidently
went
to
greet
me
leaving
gabrielle
in
miss
engledue
care
horton
even
though
he
had
been
engaged
in
serving
the
dinner
at
the
rear
of
the
house
was
apparently
also
on
the
for
me
and
now
i
recollected
that
on
my
journey
down
from
york
i
had
mentioned
to
suzor
my
habit
of
going
to
visit
my
uncle
in
orchard
street
on
certain
evenings
he
had
asked
me
to
dine
with
him
on
the
seventh
but
i
had
excused
myself
as
my
uncle
would
expect
me
that
evening
he
evidently
held
previous
knowledge
that
the
route
i
habitually
took
was
through
stretton
street
hence
the
plot
to
get
me
within
that
house
besides
it
was
quite
likely
that
suzor
himself
was
watching
for
me
and
had
sent
horton
out
to
call
me
in
any
case
the
plot
had
been
and
elaborately
thought
out
the
fact
was
plain
that
gabrielle
engledue
who
had
sent
her
luggage
to
the
station
and
was
about
to
return
to
madrid
was
killed
probably
by
the
scratch
of
a
pin
upon
which
orosin
had
been
placed
all
this
is
most
astounding
declared
superintendent
fletcher
of
course
de
gex
contrived
that
no
inquiry
would
be
made
concerning
the
dead
girl
he
might
have
shown
you
the
body
of
miss
engledue
but
he
had
some
motive
in
keeping
it
from
you
and
obtaining
a
death
certificate
for
the
girl
who
was
still
living
the
motive
was
that
he
was
not
quite
certain
whether
the
orosin
could
be
detected
since
then
he
has
grown
bolder
as
witness
the
murder
of
the
baron
van
veltrup
i
replied
but
why
should
he
not
have
shown
you
the
dead
girl
queried
the
superintendent
because
he
no
doubt
wished
to
mystify
me
in
case
of
my
recovery
from
the
effects
of
the
drug
was
my
reply
he
was
not
quite
certain
of
the
effect
that
the
dose
might
have
upon
me
so
in
order
to
entirely
mislead
me
so
that
if
i
recovered
my
statements
would
be
discredited
he
showed
me
a
girl
who
was
still
living
though
to
all
intents
dead
indeed
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
aided
by
moroni
he
purposely
contrived
that
i
should
meet
and
recognize
in
miss
tennison
the
girl
i
had
been
told
was
the
dead
girl
gabrielle
engledue
and
i
confess
that
i
have
been
sorely
puzzled
all
along
that
the
girl
whom
i
had
seen
dead
was
actually
alive
even
though
her
mental
state
was
such
as
to
show
that
she
had
met
with
foul
play
yes
remarked
rivero
the
plot
was
very
cunningly
conceived
especially
the
manner
in
which
you
were
entrapped
and
induced
to
give
the
certificate
here
is
the
money
which
de
gex
gave
me
for
my
share
in
the
crime
i
said
openly
laying
the
bank
notes
upon
the
superintendent
table
i
suppose
some
action
will
be
taken
against
me
but
i
am
prepared
to
take
the
consequences
now
that
i
have
unmasked
one
of
the
greatest
and
most
dangerous
criminals
of
modern
times
you
certainly
have
done
that
garfield
remarked
superintendent
fletcher
and
i
venture
to
think
that
the
part
which
you
have
played
in
solving
this
problem
will
be
taken
into
account
when
your
own
actions
are
considered
it
seems
to
me
remarked
rivero
that
the
reason
the
moroni
evinced
such
a
keen
interest
in
miss
tennison
and
his
reason
for
taking
her
to
a
number
of
specialists
was
solely
in
order
to
gain
their
opinions
and
so
further
study
the
effects
of
the
deadly
drug
which
he
prepared
i
have
learnt
i
said
that
moroni
was
the
laboratory
assistant
of
the
late
professor
orosi
the
discoverer
of
the
drug
ah
then
of
course
he
knows
the
secret
of
its
preparation
how
to
administer
it
and
in
what
doses
remarked
fletcher
even
i
said
i
have
had
yet
another
attempt
upon
my
life
made
by
these
scoundrels
and
from
my
pocket
i
drew
the
little
packet
containing
the
sample
cake
of
which
i
displayed
to
them
all
then
handling
it
in
the
thick
brown
paper
wrapping
i
took
my
and
scraped
the
soap
quickly
revealing
a
number
of
sharp
steel
points
imbedded
in
it
you
see
there
are
sharp
clippings
in
it
each
has
no
doubt
been
treated
with
orosin
i
said
had
i
washed
my
hands
with
it
as
a
trial
they
would
have
become
scratched
and
infected
with
the
deadly
poison
before
i
was
aware
of
it
sanz
has
no
doubt
sent
you
that
remarked
rivero
instantly
well
hugh
it
is
certainly
a
providential
escape
that
you
discovered
in
time
this
latest
plot
against
you
exclaimed
gabrielle
really
the
craft
and
cunning
of
de
gex
is
without
limit
but
i
think
miss
tennison
that
you
need
have
nothing
further
to
fear
from
him
said
the
superintendent
with
satisfaction
he
has
no
doubt
very
powerful
friends
and
if
the
evidence
were
not
so
damning
and
direct
as
that
collected
after
so
much
patience
and
perseverance
by
garfield
he
might
perhaps
wriggle
out
of
it
but
once
we
have
him
he
can
hope
for
no
escape
he
added
and
we
shall
arrest
him
before
an
hour
is
out
fortunately
he
is
still
quite
unsuspicious
though
his
chief
fear
is
of
garfield
and
of
the
ugly
revelations
which
either
moroni
or
sanz
could
make
nevertheless
we
shall
see
conclusion
just
after
noon
i
accompanied
superintendent
fletcher
and
señor
rivero
with
three
detectives
from
scotland
yard
to
the
little
hotel
at
notting
hill
gate
where
mateo
sanz
was
then
staying
for
he
had
twice
changed
his
abode
within
the
past
week
rivero
saw
the
proprietor
and
giving
his
name
as
sanchez
orozco
a
criminal
and
friend
of
his
asked
to
see
his
visitor
who
we
knew
had
taken
the
name
of
nardiz
and
represented
himself
as
an
agent
of
a
firm
of
spanish
wine
exporters
mention
of
the
name
of
orozco
at
once
brought
the
bandit
downstairs
and
as
he
entered
the
little
rivero
covered
him
instantly
with
his
automatic
pistol
shouting
to
him
authoritatively
in
spanish
the
notorious
bandit
staggered
so
completely
was
he
taken
aback
you
know
me
sanz
exclaimed
rivero
you
are
under
arrest
now
tell
me
who
prepared
that
cake
of
soap
which
you
sent
to
mr
garfield
the
question
was
quite
an
unorthodox
procedure
in
english
justice
but
it
was
the
chief
of
the
spanish
detective
department
who
had
arrested
a
spanish
criminal
find
out
was
the
fellow
defiant
retort
it
was
oswald
de
gex
said
rivero
you
wo
deny
that
you
may
as
well
tell
the
truth
and
things
may
go
better
with
you
he
was
despujol
friend
as
well
as
yours
was
he
not
yes
the
man
admitted
sullenly
we
have
both
done
his
dirty
work
and
moroni
assisted
him
you
sent
that
soap
to
mr
garfield
eh
the
man
under
arrest
with
rivero
pistol
still
pointed
at
him
nodded
in
the
affirmative
and
you
went
to
the
hague
and
there
met
the
baron
van
veltrup
you
put
that
little
piece
of
steel
into
his
glove
i
know
that
you
did
rivero
went
on
relentlessly
yes
de
gex
paid
me
for
it
was
his
reply
as
he
paid
despujol
eh
yes
very
well
replied
rivero
i
will
note
your
replies
de
gex
is
expecting
you
to
call
upon
him
is
he
not
yes
at
one
i
was
to
receive
some
money
he
laughed
grimly
the
spaniard
having
been
taken
away
in
a
taxi
to
bow
street
police
station
together
with
his
luggage
we
went
on
to
stretton
street
de
gex
is
not
in
replied
the
who
appeared
in
answer
to
my
ring
never
mind
i
said
my
friends
and
i
have
some
business
with
him
and
i
walked
into
that
big
familiar
hall
followed
by
superintendent
fletcher
señor
rivero
and
two
detectives
we
have
a
meeting
here
i
explained
casually
to
the
smart
who
in
surprise
at
our
sudden
entry
showed
us
to
the
library
that
same
room
in
which
i
remembered
sitting
on
that
fateful
november
night
it
was
nearly
a
year
ago
since
i
had
last
been
in
that
big
handsomely
furnished
apartment
i
did
not
remain
there
for
it
was
my
intention
to
greet
my
murderer
on
his
return
therefore
i
went
to
the
hall
and
there
awaited
him
just
before
one
he
entered
with
his
latchkey
and
he
having
closed
the
door
i
stepped
forward
in
his
path
i
think
you
know
me
de
gex
i
exclaimed
very
firmly
my
eyes
fixed
on
him
he
started
and
for
a
second
went
pale
then
in
indignation
he
exclaimed
who
are
you
what
are
you
doing
here
i
am
here
to
see
you
de
gex
i
replied
quite
calmly
i
do
know
you
he
declared
angrily
perhaps
not
i
laughed
but
there
are
others
with
me
here
who
wish
to
speak
a
few
words
with
you
as
i
said
this
superintendent
fletcher
stepped
forward
while
behind
him
came
the
others
oswald
de
gex
he
asked
is
that
your
name
the
owner
of
the
big
mansion
went
pale
to
the
lips
and
muttered
an
affirmative
i
hold
a
warrant
for
your
arrest
on
the
charge
of
the
wilful
murder
of
gabrielle
engledue
on
the
seventh
of
november
last
said
the
superintendent
your
accomplice
sanz
is
already
under
arrest
i
may
tell
you
and
orders
have
gone
out
to
paris
and
to
florence
for
the
arrest
of
your
friends
suzor
and
moroni
then
turning
to
his
lieutenants
he
gave
orders
for
the
great
financier
to
be
secured
so
utterly
aghast
was
the
guilty
man
at
our
sudden
appearance
and
the
terrible
charge
levelled
against
him
that
he
was
quite
unable
to
speak
he
tried
to
articulate
to
protest
but
his
tongue
seemed
tied
only
a
low
gurgling
sound
escaped
his
lips
and
the
next
second
he
had
collapsed
into
the
arms
of
the
detectives
who
half
carried
him
out
to
the
taxi
which
stood
near
by
in
readiness
he
was
placed
in
a
cell
at
bow
street
to
await
his
appearance
before
the
stipendiary
on
the
following
day
but
an
hour
later
when
the
warder
went
to
him
he
found
him
dead
upon
the
thumb
of
his
left
hand
was
a
slight
punctured
wound
rather
than
face
a
trial
and
the
penalty
for
his
crimes
he
had
killed
himself
by
that
same
most
deadly
drug
by
which
he
had
sought
to
enrich
himself
next
day
all
the
world
rang
with
the
sensational
news
of
the
arrest
and
suicide
of
the
mighty
millionaire
of
europe
but
de
gex
had
many
influential
friends
hence
to
the
public
the
actual
truth
was
never
disclosed
mateo
sanz
was
extradited
to
spain
where
at
the
assize
court
at
madrid
he
was
six
months
later
sentenced
to
death
and
in
due
course
executed
while
moroni
after
many
delays
as
is
usual
in
the
italian
courts
was
sentenced
to
fifteen
years
imprisonment
for
being
in
the
possession
of
orosin
and
also
attempting
to
administer
it
the
charge
against
him
of
having
had
a
hand
in
the
heartless
murder
of
poor
gabrielle
engledue
was
unfortunately
not
substantiated
for
lack
of
evidence
though
the
police
are
still
seeking
everywhere
for
gaston
suzor
he
has
not
up
to
the
present
been
found
they
however
do
not
despair
of
arresting
him
at
first
it
was
resolved
to
seek
the
horton
and
arrest
him
but
as
it
seemed
that
he
had
had
no
actual
hand
in
the
assassination
and
as
moreover
the
murderer
had
committed
suicide
his
evidence
was
not
required
the
after
him
was
dropped
and
myself
what
need
i
say
except
that
i
am
extremely
happy
owing
to
the
sudden
great
rise
of
some
securities
which
my
father
left
me
i
later
found
myself
quite
well
off
indeed
upon
the
death
of
old
francis
a
few
months
ago
i
was
able
to
purchase
a
partnership
in
the
firm
and
i
am
thankful
to
say
we
are
doing
quite
well
in
face
of
the
strenuous
competition
in
electrical
engineering
gabrielle
tennison
the
sweet
girl
whom
i
first
met
under
such
extraordinary
circumstances
is
now
my
wife
we
live
very
happily
in
a
charming
farmhouse
embowered
in
roses
and
honeysuckle
on
the
portsmouth
road
at
cobham
in
surrey
life
nowadays
is
one
of
idyllic
bliss
of
perfect
love
and
undisturbed
peace
different
indeed
from
that
fevered
year
of
struggle
adventure
travel
and
unrest
during
which
i
strove
so
steadily
and
with
all
my
might
to
avenge
the
crimes
of
oswald
de
gex
and
to
unravel
that
tangled
skein
of
the
misdeeds
of
the
international
financier
the
stretton
street
affair
