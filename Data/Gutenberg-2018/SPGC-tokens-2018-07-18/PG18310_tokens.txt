in
a
preface
this
story
is
the
result
of
eight
years
spent
in
ethnological
and
archæological
study
among
the
pueblo
indians
of
new
mexico
the
first
chapters
were
written
more
than
six
years
ago
at
the
pueblo
of
cochiti
the
greater
part
was
composed
in
at
santa
fé
after
i
had
bestowed
upon
the
tehuas
the
same
interest
and
attention
i
had
previously
paid
to
their
neighbours
the
queres
i
was
prompted
to
perform
the
work
by
a
conviction
that
however
scientific
works
may
tell
the
truth
about
the
indian
they
exercise
always
a
limited
influence
upon
the
general
public
and
to
that
public
in
our
country
as
well
as
abroad
the
indian
has
remained
as
good
as
unknown
by
clothing
sober
facts
in
the
garb
of
romance
i
have
hoped
to
make
the
truth
about
the
pueblo
indians
more
accessible
and
perhaps
more
acceptable
to
the
public
in
general
the
sober
facts
which
i
desire
to
convey
may
be
divided
into
three
classes
geographical
ethnological
and
archæological
the
descriptions
of
the
country
and
of
its
nature
are
real
the
descriptions
of
manners
and
customs
of
creed
and
rites
are
from
actual
observations
by
myself
and
other
ethnologists
from
the
statements
of
trustworthy
indians
and
from
a
great
number
of
spanish
sources
of
old
date
in
which
the
pueblo
indian
is
represented
as
he
lived
when
still
unchanged
by
contact
with
european
civilization
the
descriptions
of
architecture
are
based
upon
investigations
of
ruins
still
in
existence
on
the
sites
where
they
are
placed
in
the
story
the
plot
is
my
own
but
most
of
the
scenes
described
i
have
witnessed
and
there
is
a
basis
for
it
in
a
dim
tradition
preserved
by
the
queres
of
cochiti
that
their
ancestors
dwelt
on
the
rito
de
los
frijoles
a
number
of
centuries
ago
and
in
a
similar
tradition
among
the
tehuas
of
the
pueblo
of
santa
clara
in
regard
to
the
of
the
puye
a
word
to
the
linguist
the
dialect
spoken
by
the
actors
is
that
of
cochiti
for
the
queres
that
of
san
juan
for
the
tehuas
in
order
to
avoid
the
complicated
orthography
latterly
adopted
by
scientists
for
indian
dialects
i
have
written
indian
words
and
phrases
as
they
would
be
pronounced
in
continental
languages
the
letter
is
used
to
denote
the
sound
of
a
in
hare
to
those
who
have
so
kindly
assisted
me
in
particular

preface
to
the
second
edition
the
aim
of
our
good
and
lamented
friend
in
writing
this
book
was
to
place
before
the
public
in
novelistic
garb
an
account
of
the
life
and
activities
of
the
pueblo
indians
before
the
coming
of
white
men
the
information
on
which
it
is
based
was
the
result
of
his
personal
observations
during
many
years
of
study
among
the
sedentary
tribes
of
new
mexico
and
in
spanish
archives
pertaining
thereto
in
connection
with
his
researches
for
the
archæological
institute
of
america
he
spent
months
in
continuous
study
at
the
tehua
pueblo
of
san
juan
and
the
queres
pueblo
of
cochití
and
the
regard
in
which
he
was
held
by
the
simple
folk
of
those
and
other
native
villages
was
sincerely
affectionate
bandelier
labors
in
his
chosen
field
were
commenced
at
a
time
when
a
battle
with
hardship
was
a
part
of
the
daily
routine
and
his
method
of
performing
the
tasks
before
him
was
of
the
kind
that
produced
important
results
often
at
the
expense
of
great
suffering
which
on
more
than
one
occasion
almost
shut
out
his
life
because
not
understood
delight
was
not
received
at
first
with
enthusiastic
favor
it
seemed
unlike
the
great
student
of
technical
problems
deliberately
to
write
a
book
the
layman
might
read
with
interest
and
profit
but
his
object
once
comprehended
the
volume
was
received
in
the
spirit
in
which
the
venture
was
initiated
and
for
a
long
while
search
for
a
copy
has
often
been
in
vain
bandelier
has
come
unto
his
own
more
than
one
serious
student
of
the
of
our
southwest
has
frankly
declared
that
the
basis
of
future
investigation
of
the
kind
that
bandelier
inaugurated
will
always
be
the
writings
of
that
eminent
man
had
he
been
permitted
to
live
and
labor
nothing
would
have
given
him
greater
satisfaction
than
the
knowledge
that
the
people
among
whom
he
spent
so
many
years
are
of
those
who
fully
appreciate
the
breadth
of
his
learning
and
who
have
been
instrumental
in
the
creation
by
proclamation
of
the
president
of
the
bandelier
national
monument
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
for
future
generations
some
of
the
archæological
remains
he
was
the
first
to
observe
and
describe
hodge
smithsonian
institution
washington
note
a
special
interest
attaches
to
the
illustrations
now
first
included
in
this
edition
many
of
them
are
from
photographs
made
by
chas
lummis
in
under
the
supervision
of
bandelier
and
with
special
reference
to
the
delight
makers
then
being
written
these
two
friends
were
the
first
students
to
explore
the
tyuonyi
and
its
neighborhood
in
rain
and
shine
afoot
without
blankets
or
overcoats
with
no
more
provision
than
a
little
popcorn
meal
and
sweet
chocolate
they
climbed
the
cliffs
threaded
the
cañons
slept
in
caves
or
under
trees
measured
mapped
and
photographed
the
ruins
and
landscapes
with
a
camera
and
laid
the
for
part
of
bandelier
monumental
final
report
to
the
archæological
institute
of
america
a
few
later
photographs
from
the
same
hand
show
part
of
the
excavation
done
in
the
tyuonyi
by
the
school
of
american
archæology
through
whose
loving
and
grateful
efforts
this
cañon
has
been
set
apart
as
a
national
monument
bearing
the
name
of
its
discoverer
and
chronicler
adolf
bandelier
thanks
are
due
also
to
hon
frederick
hicks
for
six
very
interesting
photographs
of
the
zuñis
and
their
country
in
memory
one
day
of
august
in
the
teeth
of
a
particular
new
mexico
that
whipped
pebbles
the
size
of
a
bean
straight
to
your
face
a
ruddy
bronzed
man
dusty
but
unweary
with
his
tramp
from
zuñi
walked
into
my
solitary
camp
at
los
alamitos
within
the
afternoon
i
knew
that
here
was
the
most
extraordinary
mind
i
had
met
there
and
then
began
the
uncommon
friendship
which
lasted
till
his
death
a
quarter
of
a
century
later
and
a
love
and
admiration
which
will
be
of
my
dearest
memories
so
long
as
i
shall
live
i
was
at
first
suspicious
of
the
memory
which
could
not
only
tell
me
some
queres
word
i
was
searching
for
but
add
policárpio
explained
that
to
me
in
cochití
november
but
i
discovered
that
this
classified
memory
was
an
integral
part
of
this
extraordinary
genius
the
acid
tests
of
collaboration
proved
not
only
this
but
the
judicial
poise
the
marvelous
insight
and
the
intellectual
chastity
of
bandelier
mind
i
can
not
conceive
of
anything
in
the
world
which
would
have
made
him
trim
his
sails
as
a
historian
or
a
student
for
any
advantage
here
or
hereafter
aside
from
keen
mutual
interests
of
documentary
and
ethnologic
study
we
came
to
know
one
another
humanly
by
the
hard
proof
of
the
frontier
thousands
of
miles
of
wilderness
and
desert
we
trudged
side
by
side
camped
starved
shivered
learned
and
were
glad
together
our
joint
pursuits
in
comfort
at
our
homes
in
santa
fé
and
isleta
respectively
will
always
be
memorable
to
me
but
never
so
wonderful
as
that
companioning
in
the
hardships
of
what
was
in
our
day
the
really
difficult
fringe
of
the
southwest
there
was
not
a
decent
road
we
had
no
endowment
no
vehicles
bandelier
was
once
loaned
a
horse
and
after
riding
two
miles
led
it
the
rest
of
the
thirty
so
we
went
always
by
foot
my
big
camera
and
glass
plates
in
the
knapsack
on
my
back
the
heavy
tripod
under
my
arm
his
aneroid
surveying
instruments
and
satchel
of
the
almost
microscopic
notes
which
he
kept
fully
and
precisely
every
night
by
the
even
when
i
had
to
crouch
over
him
and
the
precious
paper
with
my
focusing
cloth
somehow
bestowed
about
him
up
and
down
pathless
cliffs
through
tangled
cañons
fording
icy
streams
and
sands
we
travailed
no
blankets
overcoats
or
other
shelter
and
the
only
commissary
a
few
cakes
of
sweet
chocolate
and
a
small
sack
of
parched
popcorn
meal
our
lodging
was
the
cold
ground
when
we
could
find
a
cave
a
tree
or
anything
to
temper
the
wind
or
keep
off
part
of
the
rain
all
right
if
not
the
open
so
i
came
to
love
him
as
well
as
revere
i
had
known
many
scientists
and
what
happened
when
they
really
got
outdoors
he
was
in
no
way
an
athlete
nor
even
muscular
i
was
both
and
not
very
long
before
had
completed
my
tramp
across
the
continent
but
i
never
had
to
slow
down
for
him
sometimes
it
was
necessary
to
use
laughing
force
to
detain
him
at
dark
where
we
had
water
and
a
leaning
cliff
instead
of
stumbling
on
through
the
trackless
night
to
an
unknown
somewheres
he
has
always
reminded
me
of
john
muir
the
only
other
man
i
have
known
intimately
who
was
as
insatiate
a
climber
and
inspiring
a
talker
but
bandelier
had
one
advantage
he
could
find
common
ground
with
i
have
seen
him
with
presidents
diplomats
irish
mexican
peons
indians
authors
scientists
and
society
within
an
hour
or
so
he
was
easily
the
center
not
unconscious
of
his
power
he
had
an
extraordinary
and
sensitive
modesty
which
handicapped
him
through
life
among
those
who
had
the
gift
of
push
he
never
put
himself
forward
either
in
person
or
in
his
writing
but
something
about
him
fascinated
all
these
classes
of
people
when
he
spoke
his
command
of
english
french
spanish
and
german
might
have
been
expected
but
his
facility
in
acquiring
the
dialects
of
railroad
men
and
cowboys
or
the
language
of
an
indian
tribe
was
almost
uncanny
when
he
first
visited
me
in
isleta
he
knew
just
three
words
of
tigua
in
ten
days
he
could
make
himself
understood
by
the
hour
with
the
principales
in
their
own
unwritten
tongue
of
course
this
was
one
secret
of
his
extraordinary
success
in
learning
the
inner
heart
of
the
indians
i
saw
it
proved
again
in
our
contact
with
the
quíchua
and
aymará
and
other
tribes
of
peru
and
bolivia
i
have
known
many
scholars
and
some
heroes
but
they
seldom
come
in
the
same
original
package
as
i
remember
bandelier
with
smallpox
alone
in
the
snows
of
the
manzanos
his
tens
of
thousands
of
miles
of
tramping
exploring
measuring
describing
in
the
southwest
his
year
afoot
and
alone
in
northern
mexico
with
no
more
weapon
than
a
on
the
trails
of
raiding
apaches
where
scientific
expeditions
ten
years
later
when
the
apache
was
eliminated
needed
armed
convoys
and
enough
for
a
punitive
expedition
and
wrote
pretentious
books
about
what
every
scholar
has
known
for
three
hundred
years
i
deeply
wonder
at
the
dual
quality
of
his
intellect
among
them
all
i
have
never
known
such
student
and
such
explorer
lodged
in
one
tenement
we
were
knit
not
only
thus
but
in
the
very
intimacies
of
life
sharing
hopes
and
bereavements
my
first
son
named
for
him
should
now
be
the
old
home
in
santa
fé
was
as
my
own
the
truly
wonderful
little
woman
he
found
in
peru
for
mate
who
shared
his
hardships
among
the
cannibals
of
the
amazonas
and
elsewhere
and
so
aided
and
still
carries
on
his
work
i
met
in
her
maiden
home
and
am
glad
i
may
still
call
her
friend
naturally
among
my
dearest
memories
of
our
trampings
together
is
that
of
the
rito
the
tyuonyi
it
had
never
in
any
way
been
pictured
before
we
were
the
first
students
that
ever
explored
it
he
had
discovered
it
and
was
writing
the
delight
makers
what
days
those
were
the
weather
was
no
friend
of
ours
nor
of
the
camera
we
were
wet
and
and
cold
by
night
even
in
the
ancient
tiny
caves
but
the
unforgettable
glory
of
it
all
thousands
of
people
annually
visit
the
tyuonyi
at
ease
and
camp
for
weeks
in
comfort
the
school
of
american
archæology
has
a
summer
session
there
and
its
excavations

normal
students
and
budding
archæologists
sleep
in
the
very
caves
identified
of
the
eagle
people
the
turquoise
snake
and
other
clans
and
in
that
enchanted
valley
we
remember
not
only
the
ancients
but
the
man
who
gave
all
this
to
the
world
during
the
six
years
i
was
librarian
of
the
los
angeles
public
library
far
later
no
other
book
on
the
southwest
was
so
eagerly
sought
as
the
delight
makers
we
had
great
trouble
in
getting
our
own
copy
which
slept
in
the
safe
the
many
students
who
wished
copies
of
their
very
own
were
referred
to
dealers
in
americana
who
searched
for
this
already
rare
volume
and
many
were
proud
to
get
it
at
last
at
ten
fifteen
and
even
twenty
times
its
original
price
it

invariably
abrupt
and
often
even
perpendicular
whereas
the
opposite
declivities
though
steep
still
afford
room
for
scanty
vegetation
the
gorges
run
from
west
to
east
that
is
they
descend
from
the
mountain
crests
to
the
rio
grande
cutting
the
long
and
narrow
pedestal
on
which
the
high
summits
are
resting
through
some
but
not
all
of
these
gorges
run
streams
of
clear
water
in
a
few
instances
the
gorge
expands
and
takes
the
proportions
of
a
narrow
vale
then
the
high
timber
that
usually
skirts
the
rivulets
shrinks
to
detached
groves
and
patches
of
clear
land
appear
which
if
cultivated
would
afford
scanty
support
to
one
or
two
modern
families
to
the
village
indian
such
tillable
spots
were
of
the
greatest
value
the
deep
ravine
afforded
shelter
not
only
against
the
climate
but
against
roving
enemies
and
the
land
was
sufficient
for
his
modest
crops
since
his
wants
were
limited
and
game
was
abundant
the
material
of
which
the
walls
of
these
cañons
are
composed
suggested
in
times
past
to
the
indian
the
idea
of
using
them
as
a
home
the
tufa
and
are
so
friable
that
as
we
have
said
the
rock
can
be
dug
or
burrowed
with
the
most
primitive
implements
it
was
easier
in
fact
to
excavate
dwellings
than
to
pile
up
walls
in
the
open
air
therefore
the
northern
sides
of
these
secluded
gorges
are
perforated
in
many
places
by
openings
similar
in
appearance
to
these
openings
are
the
points
of
exit
and
entrance
of
artificial
caves
dug
out
by
sedentary
aborigines
in
times
long
past
they
are
met
with
in
clusters
of
as
many
as
several
hundred
more
frequently
however
the
groups
are
small
sometimes
two
or
more
tiers
of
caves
are
superimposed
from
the
objects
scattered
about
and
in
the
cells
and
from
the
size
and
disposition
of
the
latter
it
becomes
evident
that
the
people
who
excavated
and
inhabited
them
were
on
the
same
level
of
culture
as
the
pueblo
indians
of
new
mexico
it
is
not
surprising
therefore
that
some
traditions
and
myths
are
preserved
among
the
pueblos
concerning
these
thus
the
tehua
indians
of
the
pueblo
of
santa
clara
assert
that
the
artificial
grottos
of
what
they
call
the
puiye
and
the
shufinne
west
of
their
present
abodes
were
the
homes
of
their
ancestors
at
one
time
the
queres
of
cochiti
in
turn
declare
that
the
tribe
to
which
they
belong
occupied
many
centuries
before
the
first
coming
of
europeans
to
new
mexico
the
cluster
of
visible
at
this
day
although
abandoned
and
in
ruins
in
that
romantic
and
picturesquely
secluded
gorge
called
in
the
queres
dialect
tyuonyi
and
in
spanish
el
rito
de
los
frijoles
the
rito
is
a
beautiful
spot
situated
in
a
direct
line
not
over
twenty
miles
west
of
santa
fé
it
can
still
be
reached
only
after
a
long
tedious
travel
it
is
a
narrow
valley
nowhere
broader
than
half
a
mile
and
from
where
it
begins
in
the
west
to
where
it
closes
in
a
dark
and
gloomy
entrance
scarcely
wide
enough
for
two
men
to
pass
abreast
in
the
east
its
length
does
not
exceed
six
miles
its
southern
rim
is
formed
by
the
slope
of
a
timbered
mesa
and
that
slope
is
partly
overgrown
by
shrubbery
the
northern
border
constitutes
a
line
of
vertical
cliffs
of
yellowish
and
white
pumice
projecting
and
like
decorations
of
a
stage
now
perpendicular
and
smooth
for
some
distance
now
sweeping
back
in
the
shape
of
an
arched
segment
these
cliffs
vary
in
height
although
nowhere
are
they
less
than
two
hundred
feet
their
tops
rise
in
huge
pillars
in
crags
and
pinnacles
brushwood
and
pine
timber
crown
the
mesa
of
which
these
fantastic
projections
are
but
the
shaggy
border
through
the
vale
itself
rustles
the
clear
and
cool
brook
to
which
the
name
of
rito
de
los
frijoles
is
applied
it
meanders
on
hugging
the
southern
slope
partly
through
open
spaces
partly
through
groves
of
timber
and
again
past
tall
stately
standing
isolated
in
the
valley
willows
cottonwoods
and
elders
form
small
thickets
along
its
banks
the
rito
is
a
permanent
streamlet
notwithstanding
its
small
size
its
water
freezes
in
winter
but
it
never
dries
up
completely
during
the
summer
months
bunches
of
tall
grass
low
shrubbery
and
cactus
grow
in
the
open
spaces
between
rocky
débris
fallen
from
above
they
also
cover
in
part
low
mounds
of
rubbish
and
ruins
of
a
large
pentagonal
building
erected
formerly
at
the
foot
of
a
slope
leading
to
the
cliffs
in
the
cliffs
themselves
for
a
distance
of
about
two
miles
numerous
caves
dug
out
by
the
hand
of
man
are
visible
some
of
these
are
yet
perfect
others
have
wholly
crumbled
away
except
the
rear
wall
from
a
distance
the
and
indentations
appear
like
so
many
pigeons
nests
in
the
naked
rock
together
with
the
cavities
formed
by
amygdaloid
chambers
and
crevices
caused
by
erosion
they
give
the
cliffs
the
appearance
of
a
huge
irregular
honeycomb
these
ruins
inside
as
well
as
outside
the
northern
walls
of
the
cañon
of
the
rito
bear
testimony
to
the
tradition
still
current
among
the
queres
indians
of
new
mexico
that
the
rito
or
tyuonyi
was
once
inhabited
by
people
of
their
kind
nay
even
of
their
own
stock
but
the
time
when
those
people
wooed
and
wed
lived
and
died
in
that
secluded
vale
is
past
long
long
ago
centuries
previous
to
the
advent
of
the
spaniards
the
rito
was
already
deserted
nothing
remains
but
the
ruins
of
former
abodes
and
the
memory
of
their
inhabitants
among
their
descendants
these
ancient
people
of
the
rito
are
the
actors
in
the
story
which
is
now
to
be
told
the
stage
in
the
main
is
the
rito
itself
the
language
of
the
actors
is
the
queres
dialect
and
the
time
when
the
events
occurred
is
much
anterior
to
the
discovery
of
america
to
the
invention
of
gunpowder
and
the
in
europe
still
the
rito
must
have
appeared
then
much
as
it
appears
now
a
quiet
lovely
picturesque
retreat
peaceful
when
basking
in
the
sunlight
wonderfully
quiet
when
the
stars
sparkled
over
it
or
the
moon
shed
its
floods
of
silver
on
the
cliffs
and
on
the
murmuring
brook
below
in
the
lower
or
western
part
of
its
course
the
tyuonyi
rushes
in
places
through
thickets
and
small
groves
out
of
which
rise
tall
it
is
very
still
on
the
banks
of
the
brook
when
on
a
warm
june
day
is
just
past
and
no
breeze
fans
the
air
not
a
sound
is
heard
beyond
the
rippling
of
the
water
the
birds
are
asleep
and
the
noise
of
human
activity
does
not
reach
there
from
the
cliffs
still
on
the
day
of
which
we
are
now
speaking
a
voice
arose
from
the
thicket
calling
aloud
umo
to
ima
satyumishe
hither
my
brother
another
voice
replied
in
the
same
dialect
adding
see
what
a
big
fish
i
have
caught
it
sounded
as
though
this
second
voice
had
issued
from
the
very
waters
of
the
streamlet
pine
boughs
rustled
branches
bent
and
leaves
shook
a
step
scarcely
audible
was
followed
by
a
noiseless
leap
on
a
boulder
around
which
flowed
streams
of
limpid
water
there
alighted
a
young
indian
he
was
of
medium
height
and
his
hands
and
feet
were
rather
small
and
delicate
he
carried
his
head
erect
with
ease
and
freedom
hair
slightly
waving
streamed
loose
over
temples
and
cheeks
and
was
gathered
at
the
back
in
a
short
thick
knot
in
front
it
parted
naturally
leaving
exposed
a
narrow
strip
of
the
brow
the
features
of
the
face
though
not
regular
were
still
attractive
for
large
black
eyes
shone
bright
from
underneath
heavy
lashes
the
complexion
was
dusky
and
the
skin
had
a
velvety
gloss
form
carriage
and
face
together
betokened
a
youth
of
about
eighteen
years
his
costume
was
very
plain
a
garment
of
unbleached
cotton
coarsely
woven
covered
the
body
as
low
as
the
knee
this
garment
sleeveless
and
soiled
by
wear
was
tied
over
the
right
shoulder
a
scarf
or
belt
of
the
same
material
fastened
it
around
the
waist
feet
arms
and
the
left
shoulder
were
bare
primitive
as
was
this
costume
there
was
nevertheless
an
attempt
here
and
there
at
decoration
the
belt
was
ornamented
with
black
and
white
stitches
from
each
ear
hung
a
turquoise
suspended
by
a
cotton
thread
and
a
necklace
of
coloured
pebbles
strung
on
yucca
fibre
encircled
the
neck
like
a
statue
of
bronze
decked
with
scanty
drapery
and
adorned
with
crude
trinkets
holding
a
bow
in
the
right
hand
while
the
left
clenched
a
few
untipped
arrows
the
youth
stood
on
the
boulder
outlined
against
the
shrubbery
immovable
above
the
running
brook
his
gaze
was
fixed
on
the
opposite
bank
where
a
youngster
was
kneeling
the
latter
was
a
boy
of
perhaps
nine
years
a
dirty
wrap
hung
loosely
over
shoulders
and
back
and
no
necklace
or
decorated
his
body
but
the
childish
features
were
enlivened
by
a
broad
grin
of
satisfaction
and
his
eyes
sparkled
like
coals
just
igniting
while
he
pointed
to
a
large
mountain
trout
which
he
pressed
against
a
stone
with
both
hands
he
looked
at
the
older
youth
with
an
expression
not
merely
of
pleasure
but
of
familiar
intimacy
also
it
was
clear
that
both
boys
were
children
of
the
same
parents
the
younger
one
spoke
first
see
here
okoya
he
began
grinning
while
you
are
older
than
i
and
bigger
and
stronger
i
am
more
cunning
than
you
ever
since
the
sun
came
out
you
have
followed
the
turkeys
and
what
have
you
nothing
your
hands
are
empty
i
have
just
come
down
from
the
field
and
look
i
caught
this
fish
in
the
water
shall
we
fry
and
eat
it
here
or
carry
it
home
to
the
mother
the
older
brother
did
not
relish
the
taunt
his
lips
curled
he
replied
scornfully
any
child
may
catch
a
fish
but
only
men
can
follow
turkeys
the
tzina
is
shy
and
wary
it
knows
how
sure
my
aim
is
therefore
it
hides
when
i
go
out
to
hunt
the
little
one
replied
to
this
pompous
explanation
with
a
clear
mocking
laugh
turkeys
care
nothing
about
you
he
retorted
it
is
nothing
to
them
whether
you
go
out
or
not
shyuote
his
brother
scolded
stop
prating
about
things
of
which
you
do
not
know
it
is
true
i
am
not
one
of
the
order
of
hunters
shyayak
but
i
may
become
so
soon
he
stopped
as
if
a
sudden
thought
had
struck
him
and
then
exclaimed
now
i
know
why
luck
has
failed
me
this
morning
when
i
left
our
houses
i
should
have
scattered
meal
and
placed
a
pebble
on
the
heap
beside
the
trail
and
offered
a
plume
to
our
mother
above
all
this
i
neglected
now
i
am
punished
for
it
by
the
birds
concealing
themselves
for
had
they
come
out
you
would
have
missed
them
tauntingly
replied
the
other
if
you
want
to
kill
turkeys
join
the
koshare
then
you
will
catch
them
with
roots
and
flowers
okoya
grew
angry
hush
foolish
boy
he
retorted
what
are
the
koshare
to
me
speak
about
such
things
here
come
take
your
fish
and
let
us
go
home
with
this
okoya
leaped
over
the
brook
shyuote
whispered
audibly
to
him
yes
you
are
very
fond
of
the
koshare
but
the
sarcastic
remark
was
not
heeded
by
the
elder
lad
who
turned
to
go
shyuote
following
him
proudly
the
little
boy
tossed
his
fish
from
one
hand
to
the
other
beyond
the
straight
and
lofty
pine
trunks
a
whitish
glare
soon
appeared
brilliant
sunlight
broke
through
the
and
played
around
the
dark
needles
turning
them
into
a
brighter
lighter
emerald
green
a
background
of
yellow
and
rocks
visible
now
through
openings
in
the
shrubbery
showed
that
the
boys
were
approaching
a
clear
space
here
the
elder
one
suddenly
stopped
turned
to
his
brother
looked
straight
at
him
and
asked
shyuote
what
have
you
heard
about
the
koshare
instead
of
answering
the
child
looked
down
indifferent
and
silent
as
if
he
had
not
heard
the
query
what
have
you
heard
boy
continued
the
other
shyuote
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
had
no
inclination
to
reply
why
do
you
answer
okoya
persisted
his
brother
looked
up
cast
a
furtive
glance
at
the
interlocutor
then
stared
vacantly
but
with
head
erect
before
him
his
eyes
were
glassy
and
without
any
expression
illustration
the
east
end
of
the
cañon
of
the
tyuonyi
whenever
the
indian
does
not
wish
to
speak
on
any
subject
whatever
it
be
no
power
on
earth
can
compel
him
to
break
silence
okoya
as
an
indian
felt
rather
than
understood
this
and
the
child
refusal
to
answer
a
very
simple
question
aroused
his
suspicions
he
looked
at
the
stubborn
boy
for
a
moment
undecided
whether
he
would
not
resort
to
force
the
child
taunts
had
mortified
his
pride
in
the
first
place
now
that
child
reticence
bred
misgivings
he
nevertheless
restrained
both
anger
and
curiosity
for
the
present
not
because
of
indifference
but
for
policy
sake
and
turned
to
go
shyuote
looked
for
a
moment
as
if
he
wished
to
confess
to
his
brother
all
that
the
latter
inquired
about
but
soon
pouted
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
set
out
after
okoya
in
a
lively
again
the
valley
lay
before
them
they
had
reached
the
end
of
the
grove
smiling
in
the
warm
glow
of
a
june
day
with
a
sky
of
deepest
azure
the
vale
of
the
rito
expanded
between
the
spot
which
the
boys
had
reached
and
the
rocky
gateways
in
the
west
where
that
valley
seemed
to
begin
fields
small
and
covered
with
young
bushy
skirted
the
brook
whose
silvery
thread
was
seen
here
and
there
as
its
meanderings
carried
it
beneath
the
shadow
of
shrubs
and
trees
or
exposed
it
to
the
full
light
of
the
dazzling
sun
in
the
plantations
human
forms
appeared
now
erect
now
bent
down
over
their
work
a
ditch
of
medium
size
bordered
the
fields
on
the
north
carrying
water
from
the
brook
for
purposes
of
irrigation
still
north
of
the
ditch
and
between
it
and
the
cliffs
arose
a
tall
building
which
from
a
distance
looked
like
a
high
clumsy
pile
of
clay
or
reddish
earth
this
pile
was
irregularly
terraced
human
beings
stood
on
the
terraces
or
moved
along
them
now
and
then
one
was
seen
to
rise
from
the
interior
of
the
pile
to
one
of
the
terraced
roofs
or
another
slowly
sank
from
sight
as
if
descending
into
the
interior
of
the
earthy
heap
on
the
outside
beams
leaned
against
it
and
on
them
people
went
up
and
down
as
if
climbing
ladders
thin
films
of
smoke
quivered
in
the
air
from
imperceptible
flues
the
cliffs
themselves
extended
north
of
this
building
and
east
and
west
as
far
as
the
range
of
view
permitted
like
a
yellowish
ribbon
of
towering
height
with
innumerable
flexures
and
alternations
of
light
and
shade
their
base
was
enlivened
by
the
bustle
of
those
who
dwelt
in
caves
all
along
the
foot
of
the
imposing
rocky
wall
where
only
vacant
holes
stare
at
the
visitor
at
the
hour
on
the
day
when
our
story
begins
human
eyes
peered
through
other
doors
were
closed
by
or
robes
sometimes
a
man
a
woman
or
a
child
would
creep
out
of
one
of
these
openings
and
climbing
upward
disappear
in
the
entrance
of
an
upper
tier
of
others
would
descend
the
slope
from
the
cliffs
to
the
fields
while
still
others
returned
from
the
banks
of
the
ditch
or
of
the
brook
at
the
distance
from
which
the
boys
viewed
the
landscape
all
passed
noiselessly
no
human
voice
no
clamour
disturbed
the
stillness
of
the
scene
peaceful
as
nature
appeared
neither
of
the
youth
were
in
the
least
struck
by
its
charms
or
influenced
by
the
spell
which
such
a
tranquil
and
cheerful
landscape
is
likely
to
exercise
upon
thinking
and
feeling
man
with
both
it
was
indifference
for
the
indian
views
nature
with
the
eyes
of
a
materially
interested
spectator
only
but
the
elder
brother
had
another
reason
for
not
noticing
the
beauty
of
the
scene
he
was
not
only
troubled
he
was
seriously
embarrassed
the
hint
thrown
out
by
his
little
brother
about
the
koshare
had
struck
him
for
it
led
to
the
inference
that
the
child
had
knowledge
of
secret
arts
and
occult
practices
of
which
even
he
okoya
although
on
the
verge
of
manhood
had
never
received
any
intimation
far
more
yet
than
this
knowledge
which
shyuote
might
have
obtained
through
mere
accident
the
hint
at
unpleasant
relations
between
okoya
and
the
koshare
startled
the
latter
it
was
perfectly
true
that
he
not
only
disliked
but
even
hated
the
cluster
of
men
to
which
the
name
of
koshare
was
given
in
the
tribe
but
he
had
concealed
his
feelings
as
carefully
as
possible
until
now
only
once
as
far
as
he
could
remember
had
he
spoken
of
his
aversion
and
then
it
was
during
an
absolutely
confidential
conversation
with
his
own
mother
who
seemed
to
entertain
like
sentiments
to
his
father
he
had
never
uttered
a
word
because
his
father
was
himself
a
koshare
whatever
shyuote
knew
he
could
only
have
gathered
by
overhearing
a
conversation
of
the
koshare
among
themselves
in
which
it
was
mentioned
that
he
okoya
harboured
toward
that
brotherhood
in
that
case
he
might
be
exposed
to
serious
danger
since
as
he
believed
those
people
were
in
possession
of
knowledge
of
a
higher
order
and
practised
arts
of
an
occult
nature
against
danger
arising
from
such
a
source
okoya
considered
himself
utterly
defenceless
the
more
he
tried
to
think
over
these
matters
the
more
troubled
his
mind
became
only
one
thought
appeared
logical
and
probable
and
that
was
that
the
boy
had
overheard
one
or
other
of
the
koshare
intimate
conversations
but
how
came
it
that
the
koshare
knew
about
aversion
toward
them
who
could
have
told
them
only
his
mother
knew
the
secret
had
she
perhaps
she
the
thought
was
like
a
spark
which
glowed
for
a
while
grew
to
a
flame
flared
and
flickered
unsteadily
within
his
heart
then
began
to
shrink
no
no
it
was
impossible
it
could
not
be
his
mother
would
never
betray
her
child
the
flame
died
out
the
spark
remained
fast
dying
suddenly
it
blazed
up
again
as
if
some
breath
had
fanned
it
with
renewed
insistence
it
struck
okoya
that
even
if
shyuote
had
merely
overheard
a
conversation
and
the
child
knowledge
was
derived
from
that
source
the
most
extraordinary
part
of
the
information
could
only
have
come
from
one
source
the
person
in
whom
he
had
confided
his
mother
she
alone
could
have
told
the
koshare
that
okoya
hated
them
the
spark
flared
up
anew
it
burst
out
in
a
wild
flame
of
suspicion
it
singed
the
heart
and
smothered
feeling
as
well
as
reason
it
so
completely
absorbed
his
thoughts
that
okoya
forgot
everything
else
instead
of
walking
along
at
a
quiet
easy
gait
he
rushed
fast
and
faster
wrapped
in
dismal
despair
and
in
wild
impotent
wrath
heedless
of
his
little
companion
he
ran
panting
with
agitation
until
shyuote
unable
to
keep
pace
and
startled
at
his
wild
gait
pulled
his
garment
and
begged
him
to
stop
brother
he
cried
why
do
you
go
so
fast
i
can
not
follow
you
okoya
came
to
a
sudden
halt
and
turned
toward
the
boy
like
one
aroused
from
a
sinister
dream
shyuote
stared
at
him
with
surprise
akin
to
fright
how
changed
was
his
appearance
never
before
had
he
seen
him
with
a
countenance
so
haggard
with
eyes
hollow
and
yet
burning
with
a
lurid
glow
loose
hair
hung
down
over
forehead
and
cheeks
perspiration
stood
on
the
brow
in
big
drops
the
child
involuntarily
shrunk
back
and
okoya
noticing
it
gasped
you
are
right
the
day
is
long
yet
and
the
houses
near
we
will
go
slower
bowing
his
head
again
he
went
on
at
a
slower
gait
shyuote
followed
in
silence
although
surprised
at
the
change
in
his
brother
looks
he
did
not
for
a
moment
entertain
the
thought
or
desire
of
inquiring
into
the
cause
of
it
he
was
fully
satisfied
that
as
long
as
okoya
did
not
see
fit
to
speak
of
the
matter
he
had
no
right
to
ask
about
it
in
short
that
it
was
none
of
his
business
meanwhile
dark
and
dismal
thoughts
were
chasing
each
other
within
the
elder
brother
soul
doubt
and
suspicion
became
more
and
more
crushing
he
was
tempted
to
break
the
spell
and
interrogate
shyuote
once
more
even
to
wrench
from
him
if
needs
be
a
full
explanation
the
boy
was
old
enough
to
enjoy
that
great
and
often
disagreeable
quality
of
the
american
indian
reticence
furthermore
he
might
have
been
forbidden
to
speak
if
the
indian
is
not
an
ideal
being
he
is
still
less
a
stolid
mentally
squalid
brute
he
is
not
reticent
out
of
imbecility
or
mental
weakness
he
fails
properly
to
understand
much
of
what
takes
place
around
him
especially
what
happens
within
the
circle
of
our
modern
civilization
but
withal
he
is
far
from
indifferent
toward
his
surroundings
he
observes
compares
thinks
reasons
upon
whatever
he
sees
or
hears
and
forms
opinions
from
the
basis
of
his
own
peculiar
culture
his
senses
are
very
acute
for
natural
phenomena
his
memory
is
excellent
as
often
as
he
sees
fit
to
make
use
of
it
there
is
no
difference
between
him
and
the
caucasian
in
original
faculties
and
the
reticence
peculiar
to
him
under
certain
circumstances
is
not
due
to
lack
of
mental
aptitude
he
does
not
practise
that
reticence
alike
toward
all
a
great
number
of
examples
seems
to
establish
the
fact
that
the
indian
has
developed
a
system
of
casuistry
based
upon
a
remarkably
thorough
knowledge
of
human
nature
certain
matters
are
kept
concealed
from
some
people
whereas
they
are
freely
discussed
with
others
and
the
indian
hardly
ever
keeps
a
secret
to
himself
alone
it
is
nearly
always
shared
by
others
whom
the
matter
directly
concerns
it
may
be
said
of
the
red
man
that
he
keeps
secrets
in
the
same
manner
that
he
lives
namely
in
groups
or
clusters
the
reason
is
that
with
him
individualism
or
the
mental
and
moral
independence
of
the
individual
has
not
attained
the
high
degree
of
development
which
prevails
among
white
races
when
europeans
began
to
colonize
america
in
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
the
social
organization
of
its
inhabitants
presented
a
picture
such
as
had
disappeared
long
before
on
the
continent
of
europe
everywhere
there
prevailed
linguistic
segregation
divisions
into
autonomous
groups
called
tribes
or
stocks
and
within
each
of
these
equally
autonomous
clusters
whose
mutual
alliance
for
purposes
of
sustenance
and
defence
constituted
the
basis
of
tribal
society
the
latter
clusters
were
the
clans
and
they
originated
during
the
beginnings
of
the
human
family
every
clan
formed
a
group
of
supposed
looking
back
to
a
mythical
or
traditional
common
ancestor
descent
from
the
mother
being
always
plain
the
clan
claimed
descent
in
the
female
line
even
if
every
recollection
of
the
female
ancestor
were
lost
and
theoretically
all
the
members
of
one
clan
were
so
many
brothers
and
sisters
this
organization
still
exists
in
the
majority
of
tribes
the
members
of
one
clan
can
not
intermarry
and
if
all
the
women
of
a
clan
die
that
clan
dies
out
also
since
there
is
nobody
left
to
perpetuate
it
the
tribe
is
in
reality
but
a
league
the
clan
is
the
unit
at
the
time
we
speak
of
the
affairs
of
each
tribe
were
administered
by
an
assembly
of
delegates
from
all
its
clans
who
at
the
same
time
arbitrated
inevitable
disputes
between
the
several
each
clan
managed
its
own
affairs
of
which
no
one
outside
of
its
members
needed
to
know
anything
since
the
husbands
always
belonged
to
a
different
consanguine
group
from
their
wives
and
the
children
followed
their
mother
line
of
descent
the
family
was
permanently
divided
there
was
really
no
family
in
our
sense
of
the
word
the
indian
has
an
individual
name
only
he
is
in
addition
distinguished
by
the
name
of
his
clan
which
in
turn
has
its
proper
cognomen
the
affairs
of
the
father
clan
did
not
concern
his
wife
or
his
children
whereas
a
neighbour
might
be
his
confidant
on
such
matters
the
mother
son
and
daughter
spoke
among
themselves
of
matters
of
which
the
father
was
not
entitled
to
know
and
about
which
he
scarcely
ever
felt
enough
curiosity
to
inquire
consequently
there
grew
a
habit
of
not
caring
about
other
people
affairs
unless
they
affected
one
own
and
of
confiding
secrets
to
those
only
whom
they
could
concern
and
who
were
entitled
to
know
them
in
the
course
of
time
the
habit
became
a
rule
of
education
reticence
secrecy
discretion
are
therefore
no
virtues
with
the
indian
they
are
simply
the
result
of
training
okoya
too
had
been
under
the
influence
of
such
training
and
he
knew
that
shyuote
young
as
he
was
had
already
similar
seeds
planted
within
him
but
uncertainty
was
insufferable
it
weighed
too
heavily
upon
him
he
could
no
longer
bear
it
umo
he
burst
out
turning
abruptly
and
looking
at
the
boy
in
an
almost
threatening
manner
how
do
you
know
that
i
dislike
the
koshare
shyuote
cast
his
eyes
to
the
ground
and
remained
silent
his
brother
repeated
the
query
the
little
fellow
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
greater
insistence
the
elder
proceeded
shyuote
tihua
who
told
you
that
the
delight
makers
are
not
precious
to
me
nor
i
to
them
shyuote
shook
his
head
pouted
and
stared
vacantly
to
one
side
he
manifestly
refused
to
answer
cold
perspiration
stood
on
the
brow
of
the
elder
brother
his
body
quivered
in
anguish
he
realized
the
truth
of
his
suspicions
unable
any
longer
to
control
himself
he
cried
it
is
my
mother
who
told
them
trembling
with
clenched
hands
and
gnashing
teeth
he
gazed
at
the
child
unconsciously
shyuote
frightened
at
his
wild
and
menacing
attitude
and
ignorant
of
the
real
cause
of
his
brother
excitement
raised
his
hand
to
his
forehead
and
began
to
sob
a
shout
coming
from
the
immediate
vicinity
aroused
and
startled
okoya
a
voice
called
out
to
him
umo
he
looked
around
in
surprise
they
were
standing
close
to
the
cultivated
plots
and
a
man
loomed
up
from
between
the
he
it
was
who
called
and
as
soon
as
okoya
turned
toward
him
he
beckoned
the
youth
to
come
nearer
okoya
face
darkened
he
reluctantly
complied
leaped
over
the
ditch
walked
up
to
the
interlocutor
and
stood
still
before
him
in
the
attitude
of
quiet
expectancy
with
downcast
eyes
shyuote
had
dropped
to
the
ground
the
call
did
not
interfere
with
his
sobs
he
pouted
rather
than
grieved
okoya
interlocutor
was
a
man
of
strong
build
apparently
in
the
forties
his
features
although
somewhat
flat
and
broad
created
a
favourable
impression
at
first
upon
closer
scrutiny
however
the
eyes
modified
that
impression
they
were
small
and
their
look
piercing
rather
than
bright
his
costume
was
limited
to
a
tattered
of
buckskin
a
collar
of
small
white
shells
encircled
the
neck
and
from
this
necklace
dangled
a
triangular
piece
of
alabaster
flat
and
with
a
carving
on
it
suggesting
the
shape
of
a
his
hair
streamed
loose
over
the
left
ear
where
there
was
fastened
to
the
black
coarse
strands
a
tuft
of
grayish
down
this
individual
eyed
okoya
in
silence
for
a
moment
as
if
inspecting
his
person
then
he
inquired
where
do
you
come
from
the
young
fellow
looked
up
and
replied
from
below
pointing
to
the
lower
end
of
the
gorge
what
did
you
hunt
the
other
continued
glancing
at
the
bow
and
arrows
of
the
boy
tzina
and
with
perceptible
embarrassment
okoya
added
but
i
killed
nothing
the
man
seemed
not
to
heed
the
humiliation
which
this
confession
entailed
and
asked
have
you
seen
tracks
of
the
down
yonder
not
one
but
i
saw
at
a
distance
on
the
slope
two
bears
very
large
and
strong
the
other
shook
his
head
then
there
are
no
mountain
sheep
toward
that
end
of
the
tyuonyi
he
said
waving
his
left
hand
toward
the
southeast
thank
you
boy
at
the
same
time
extending
his
right
to
the
youth
okoya
grasped
it
and
breathed
on
the
outside
of
the
hand
then
he
said
hoa
umo
and
turned
and
sauntered
back
to
where
his
little
brother
was
still
squatting
and
pouting
morose
and
silent
the
man
had
also
turned
around
bent
down
and
gone
on
weeding
the
corn
withal
he
did
not
lose
sight
of
the
boys
on
the
contrary
an
occasional
stealthy
glance
from
his
eyes
shot
over
where
they
met
shyuote
rose
from
the
ground
his
eyes
were
dry
but
he
glanced
at
his
brother
with
misgivings
as
well
as
with
curiosity
the
latter
felt
a
sudden
pang
upon
beholding
the
childish
features
the
short
interruption
though
annoying
at
first
had
diverted
him
from
gloomy
thoughts
now
everything
came
back
to
his
mind
with
renewed
force
the
same
anguish
the
feeling
of
utter
helplessness
in
case
of
impending
danger
indignation
at
what
he
believed
to
have
been
base
treason
on
the
part
of
his
mother
all
this
rushed
upon
him
with
fearful
force
and
he
stood
again
motionless
a
picture
of
wild
perplexity
his
face
betokened
the
state
of
his
mind
shyuote
did
not
dare
to
inquire
of
him
further
than
to
ask
a
very
insignificant
question
namely
who
the
man
was
that
had
called
okoya
answered
readily
for
this
query
was
almost
a
relief
a
diversion
which
enabled
him
to
subdue
his
agitation
tyope
tihua
he
said
hastily
wanted
to
know
if
i
had
seen
any
mountain
sheep
i
told
him
that
i
had
only
seen
let
him
follow
those
he
growled
come
on
satyumishe
it
is
getting
late
while
this
conversation
had
been
carried
on
the
boys
now
hurrying
and
now
slackening
their
pace
had
arrived
within
a
short
distance
of
the
tall
which
was
seen
to
be
a
high
polygonal
building
apparently
closed
on
all
sides
between
them
and
this
edifice
there
was
still
another
lower
one
not
unlike
an
irregular
honeycomb
about
forty
cells
separated
from
each
other
by
walls
of
earth
carried
up
from
the
ground
to
a
few
inches
above
the
terraced
roof
constituted
a
on
which
rested
a
group
of
not
more
than
a
dozen
similar
cells
the
walls
of
this
structure
were
of
stones
irregularly
broken
and
clumsily
piled
but
they
were
covered
by
a
thick
coating
of
clay
so
that
nothing
of
the
rough
core
remained
visible
instead
of
doors
or
entrances
round
or
oval
perforated
these
walls
the
house
appeared
empty
no
smoke
flitted
over
the
flat
roof
the
coating
was
so
recent
that
many
places
were
hardly

an

north
of

a
circular
structure
thirty
feet
in
diameter
rose
a
few
feet
only
above
the
soil
like
the
upper
part
of
a
sunken
cylinder
its
top
was
flat
and
large
flags
of
stone
formed
a
rough
staircase
leading
to
its
roof
in
the
centre
a
square
opening
appeared
out
of
which
a
tall
beam
notched
at
regular
intervals
like
a
primitive
ladder
protruded
and
down
which
also
the
beam
disappeared
as
if
extended
into

of

this
edifice
half
underground
half
above
the
soil
was
what
is
called
in
new
mexico
an
this
spanish
word
has
become
a
technical
term
and
we
shall
hereafter
use
it
in
the
course
of
the
story
as
well
as
the
designations
and
of
the
queres

the

were
at

ten
five
of
which
were
circular
chambers
in
the
rock
of
the
cliffs
these
chambers
or

were
in
the
times

speak
of
gathering
places
for
men
exclusively
no
woman
was
permitted
to
enter
unless
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
food

had
its
own

slept
in
it

surveillance
of
one
or
more
of
the
aged
principals
until
they
married
and
frequently
even
afterward
there
the
young
men
became
acquainted
with
the
affairs
of
their
individual
connections
and
little
by
little
also
with
the
business
of
the
tribe
there
during
the
long
evenings
of
winter
old
men
taught
them
the
songs
and
prayers
embodying
traditions
and
myths
first
of
their
own
clan
then
of
the
tribe
the
estufa
was
school
nay
armory
to
a
certain
extent
it
was
more
many
of
the
prominent
religious
exercises
took
place
in
it
the
estufa
on
special
occasions
became
transformed
into
a
temple
for
the
clan
who
had
reared
it
from
the
depths
of
this
structure
there
came
a
series
of
dull
sounds
like
beats
of
a
drum
the
youngsters
stopped
short
and
looked
at
each
other
in
surprise
the
new
house
whispered
okoya
which
the
corn
clan
have
built
here
is
empty
yet
there
is
somebody
in
its
estufa
what
may
this
mean
let
us
look
into
it
eagerly
suggested
shyuote
go
you
alone
directed
the
elder
brother
i
will
walk
on
and
you
can
overtake
me
that
suited
shyuote
he
crept
stealthily
toward
the
round
building
there
was
an
in
the
rim
which
rose
above
the
ground
crouching
like
a
cat
the
boy
cautiously
peered
through
this
opening
but
quickly
withdrew
with
an
expression
of
disappointment
the
underground
chamber
was
not
even
finished
its
walls
were
dark
and
raw
the
floor
rough
and
on
this
floor
a
young
fellows
in
every
stage
of
dress
or
undress
were
lounging
one
of
them
mechanically
touched
a
small
drum
with
a
stick
while
two
or
three
of
the
others
were
humming
a
monotonous
tune
to
the
rhythm
of
his
rappings
shyuote
stole
away
in
evident
discontent
his
curiosity
was
satisfied
but
at
the
expense
of
his
expectations
loud
laughter
screams
and
animated
talking
diverted
his
attention
and
caused
him
to
run
in
the
direction
of
the
new
house
of
the
corn
clan
he
heard
the
voice
of
his
brother
but
at
the
same
time
women
voices
also
and
as
soon
as
he
turned
the
farther
corner
of
the
building
he
saw
what
was
plainly
a
playful
encounter
between
okoya
and
a
pair
of
young
girls
the
former
had
his
bow
in
hand
ready
to
shoot
and
he
pointed
the
arrow
at
the
maidens
alternately
they
utterly
unconcerned
about
his
weapon
were
pressing
him
with
weapons
of
their
own
which
he
was
much
more
anxious
to
avoid
than
they
his
missiles
these
were
two
pairs
of
very
dirty
hands
filled
and
covered
with
liquid
mud
with
which
the
damsels
attempted
to
decorate
his
person
okoya
was
clearly
on
the
defensive
and
the
advantage
so
far
seemed
on
the
side
of
his
aggressors
shyuote
flew
to
his
assistance
rushing
to
a
large
vessel
of
burnt
clay
standing
alongside
the
wall
and
filled
with
water
he
plunged
both
hands
into
it
and
began
to
bespatter
the
assailants
with
the
not
very
clean
liquid
forthwith
one
of
the
girls
turned
against
the
new
enemy
she
was
older
and
taller
than
shyuote
seizing
his
raven
locks
she
pulled
him
to
the
ground
on
his
face
knelt
on
the
prostrate
form
and
then
and
there
gave
the
boy
a
series
of
energetic
cuffs
against
which
the
youngster
struggled
and
wriggled
in
the
most
desperate
but
absolutely
ineffectual
manner
the
fair
sex
held
the
balance
of
power
and
wielded
it
at
every
attempt
of
shyuote
to
rise
or
to
roll
over
she
pushed
his
face
back
into
the
moist
ground
she
pulled
his
hair
thumped
his
shoulders
and
boxed
his
ears
she
was
in
earnest
and
shyuote
was
powerless
in
her
firm
grasp
he
could
not
even
scream
for
a
thick
coating
of
soil
had
fastened
itself
to
his
features
had
penetrated
into
eye
mouth
and
nostrils
his
fate
was
as
melancholy
as
it
was
ludicrous
it
brought
about
a
truce
between
okoya
and
the
other
maiden
they
dropped
he
the
weapon
she
her
muddy
arms
and
looked
at
the
other
set
of
combatants
with
surprise
and
with
immoderate
laughter
the
indian
is
not
on
such
occasions
when
the
victorious
beauty
at
last
arose
suffering
her
victim
to
turn
over
again
the
merriment
became
uproarious
for
shyuote
presented
the
appearance
of
a
blowing
spitting
coughing
statue
of
dirt
his
looks
were
in
no
manner
improved
by
his
frenzy
after
the
boy
had
rubbed
his
eyes
and
recovered
his
breath
tears
of
rage
rolled
down
his
cheeks
over
patches
of
sand
and
mud
and
when
he
noticed
the
mirth
of
the
others
shyuote
fury
knew
no
bounds
he
rushed
madly
at
the
triumphant
lass
who
did
not
shrink
from
the
hostile
approach
the
contest
was
threatening
to
assume
serious
proportions
when
another
person
appeared
upon
the
scene
at
the
sight
of
whom
even
shyuote
temporarily
stayed
all
demonstrations
while
okoya
seemed
both
startled
and
embarrassed
the
was
a
young
girl
too
she
carried
on
her
head
a
vessel
of
burnt
clay
similar
to
a
flat
urn
decorated
with
black
and
red
designs
on
ground
and
filled
with
water
to
understand
this
scene
we
must
know
that
the
two
girls
had
been
engaged
in
putting
on
the
last
coat
of
plaster
to
the
walls
of
the
abode
of
the
corn
people
when
okoya
suddenly
came
upon
them
at
a
glance
they
saw
that
he
had
been
on
a
hunt
and
also
that
he
had
hunted
in
vain
here
was
a
welcome
opportunity
for
jeering
and
mockery
they
interrupted
their
plastic
labour
and
turned
against
him
with
such
merciless
allusions
to
his
that
unable
any
longer
to
reply
to
their
sarcasm
okoya
threatened
them
in
jest
of
course
with
his
bow
instead
of
desisting
the
girls
at
once
moved
upon
him
with
muddy
hands
the
one
who
last
appeared
upon
the
scene
although
assistant
to
the
others
inasmuch
as
she
carried
the
water
needed
in
the
preparation
of
the
mud
for
plastering
had
not
seen
the
engagement
just
fought
she
looked
at
the
group
in
blank
surprise
stood
still
without
lifting
the
bowl
from
her
head
and
presented
thus
the
appearance
of
a
handsome
statue
dusky
and
graceful
whose
lustrous
black
eyes
alone
moved
glancing
from
one
of
the
members
of
the
group
to
the
other
those
large
expressive
eyes
plainly
asked
what
does
all
this
mean
the
antagonists
of
okoya
and
shyuote
were
buxom
lasses
rather
short
with
flat
faces
prominent
and
bright
eyes
the
third
maiden
was
taller
and
much
more
graceful
her
features
were
less
coarse
less
prominently
distinctive
the
nose
was
the
mouth
also
although
the
lips
were
rather
heavy
the
eyes
were
large
and
beaming
soft
yet
not
without
an
intelligent
expression
all
three
girls
were
dressed
nearly
alike
a
cotton
garment
descended
as
far
as
the
knees
it
was
tied
over
the
left
shoulder
and
the
right
was
exposed
a
scarf
served
as
belt
around
the
waist
arms
and
feet
were
bare
the
long
black
hair
streamed
loosely
two
of
them
wore
heavy
necklaces
of
green
stones
red
pebbles
and
shell
beads
the
last
comer
carried
only
a
single
string
of
shell
beads
with
an
iridescent
conch
fastened
to
it
in
front
of
turquoises
hung
from
the
ears
of
all
three
the
attention
of
the
girl
with
the
urn
on
her
head
soon
rested
on
shyuote
and
she
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
by
a
hearty
peal
of
laughter
this
started
her
companions
again
and
the
one
nearest
to
okoya
exclaimed
mitsha
help
us
throw
the
water
in
your
urn
over
the
head
of
the
boy
okoya
began
it
all
give
it
to
him
too
you
are
strong
enough
at
the
mention
of
okoya
name
the
maiden
addressed
as
mitsha
started
she
threw
a
quick
glance
like
a
flash
at
him
her
face
quivered
and
coloured
slightly
turning
away
she
deposited
the
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
and
remained
standing
her
eyes
directed
to
the
cliffs
her
lithe
fingers
carelessly
playing
with
the
beads
of
her
necklace
she
was
disinclined
to
take
any
part
in
the
fray
and
her
behaviour
acted
as
a
damper
on
the
buoyancy
of
the
others
okoya
hastily
gathered
up
his
arrows
and
called
shyuote
to
his
side
but
the
boy
did
not
care
to
obey
thirst
for
revenge
held
him
to
the
spot
of
his
defeat
he
shook
his
fists
at
the
girls
clenched
his
teeth
and
began
to
threaten
vengeance
and
to
shower
uncomplimentary
expressions
upon
them
as
soon
however
as
the
one
who
had
so
effectually
routed
him
showed
again
a
decided
movement
toward
his
raven
locks
he
beat
a
hasty
retreat
to
his
elder
brother
this
change
of
base
excited
new
hilarity
and
under
a
shower
of
jokes
and
sarcasms
the
two
boys
departed
okoya
walked
along
at
a
steady
gait
but
shyuote
as
soon
as
he
considered
the
distance
safe
enough
turned
around
making
grimaces
at
the
belligerent
damsels
vowing
vengeance
and
uttering
opprobrious
epithets
of
the
choicest
kind
he
noticed
that
the
two
returned
his
compliments
without
reserve
whereas
mitsha
stood
in
silence
leaning
against
the
one
single
look
one
earnest
almost
sad
glance
she
sent
after
the
disappearing
form
of
shyuote
elder
brother
the
main
building
was
now
close
at
hand
it
was
an
irregular
pentagon
and
at
places
two
at
others
three
stories
high
with
one
single
exception
these
stories
formed
terraces
retreating
successively
from
the
ground
to
the
top
like
so
many
steps
of
a
staircase
nowhere
did
there
appear
any
entrance
notched
beams
led
up
to
trapdoors
in
the
roofs
similar
beams
penetrated
into
the
interior
below
absolute
stillness
reigned
about
the
edifice
some
women
scoured
scanty
clothing
in
the
ditch
running
past
the
structure
on
the
terraces
not
a
soul
appeared
the
lads
directed
their
course
toward
that
side
where
the
three
stories
presented
a
perpendicular
wall
and
as
they
neared
it
an
entrance
or
doorway
high
enough
for
a
man
and
wide
enough
for
four
abreast
appeared
in
the
vertical
front
it
led
them
through
a
dark
passage
into
an
interior
court
which
was
fairly
clean
and
contained
three
estufas
its
diameter
did
not
exceed
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
toward
this
court
or
yard
the
stories
of
the
building
descended
in
terraces
also
but
though
everywhere
beams
leaned
up
as
ladders
access
to
the
was
also
afforded
by
narrow
doorways
closed
with
hides
or
mats
it
was
hot
and
quiet
in
this
yard
the
sun
shed
glaring
light
into
it
and
over
the
roofs
naked
urchins
played
and
squirmed
below
whereas
above
an
old
woman
or
some
aged
man
would
cower
motionless
shading
their
blear
eyes
with
one
hand
and
warming
their
cold
frames
in
the
heat
okoya
went
directly
to
one
of
the
openings
lifted
the
deerskin
that
hung
over
it
and
called
out
the
usual
greeting
guatzena
opona
in
responded
a
woman
voice
both
lads
obeyed
the
summons
at
first
the
room
seemed
dark
on
account
of
the
sudden
contrast
with
the
glare
outside
but
as
soon
as
this
first
impression
was
overcome
it
appeared
moderately
lighted
it
was
a
chamber
about
fourteen
feet
long
and
ten
feet
wide
and
its
walls
were
whitewashed
with
burnt
gypsum
and
a
mat
plaited
of
lay
rolled
up
in
one
corner
a
niche
contained
a
small
earthen
bowl
painted
white
with
black
symbolic
figures
a
doorway
to
the
right
led
into
another
compartment
which
seemed
darker
than
the
first
as
soon
as
the
boys
entered
the
room
a
woman
appeared
in
this
side
doorway
she
was
small
slender
and
apparently
years
of
age
her
features
notwithstanding
the
high
were
attractive
though
wan
and
thin
an
air
of
physical
suffering
lay
over
them
like
a
thin
cloudy
veil
at
the
sight
of
this
woman
okoya
heart
began
to
throb
again
for
she
it
was
whom
he
so
direly
suspected
nay
accused
of
treachery
and
deceit
this
woman
was
his
mother

especially
as

and
disposition

slightly
modified

were

lived

rooms
where
we
left
the

at
the
close
of
the
preceding
chapter
formed
such
a
home
in
the
front
one
the
family
slept
at
night
with
the
exception
of
okoya
who
was
obliged
to
join
the
other
youths
in
the
estufa
of
his
clan
the
husband
was
not
always
at
home
after
sunset
but
the
mother
shyuote
and
a
little
girl
four
years
old
invariably
took
their
nightly
rest
there
to
the
little
girl
we
have
not
yet
been
introduced
when
the
boys
returned
she
was
in
the
at
play
and
in
the
usual
state
of
complete
undress
which
is
the
regular
condition
of
indian
children
of
her
age
the
inner
cell
was
kitchen
and
storeroom
and
there
the
family
partook
of
their
meals
among
the
pueblos
the
house
was
in
charge
of
the
women
exclusively
everything
within
the
walls
of
the
house
the
men
clothing
and
weapons
excepted
belonging
to
the
housekeeper
even
the
crops
if
once
housed
were
controlled
by
her
as
long
as
they
were
in
the
field
the
husband
or
masculine
head
of
the
family
could
dispose
of
them
afterward
he
must
consult
the
woman
and
he
could
not
sell
an
ear
of
corn
without
her
consent
it
is
still
so
in
many
villages
formerly
all
the
were
gathered
and
stored
in
the
granaries
of
the
several
clans
whence
each
household
drew
its
supplies
even
the
proceeds
of
communal
hunts
and
fisheries
were
treated
in
this
manner
only
where
the
husband
son
or
brother
killed
game
while
out
alone
could
he
do
with
it
as
he
pleased
not
many
centuries
ago
the
members
of
each
clan
or
rather
the
women
their
offspring
and
aged
people
who
were
taken
care
of
by
their
children
lived
together
they
occupied
a
certain
section
of
the
great
hive
which
the
communal
dwelling
represented
and
such
a
section
was
not
unappropriately
called
in
spanish
a
or
quarter
the
husband
also
stayed
with
his
wife
and
the
younger
children
but
he
had
no
rights
as
owner
or
proprietor
to
his
abode
since
it
was
the
custom
for
women
to
raise
the
walls
of
buildings
and
to
finish
the
house
inside
and
outside
they
owned
it
also
the
man
was
only
tolerated
his
home
was
properly
with
his
clan
whither
he
must
return
in
case
his
spouse
departed
this
life
before
him
it
was
different
in
regard
to
the
fields
each
clan
had
its
particular
holding
and
since
the
devolved
upon
the
men
the
cultivated
plots
belonged
to
them
alone
within
each
allotment
every
member
who
was
of
age
or
so
situated
as
to
have
to
support
himself
or
a
family
owned
and
tilled
a
certain
plot
which
was
his
by
common
consent
although
in
no
manner
determined
by
metes
or
bounds
the
condition
of
ownership
was
regular
improvement
of
the
plot
and
if
that
condition
was
not
complied
with
any
other
member
of
the
same
clan
could
step
in
and
work
it
for
his
own
benefit
in
case
of
death
the
field
reverted
to
the
maternal
relative
of
its
owner
whereas
the
widow
and
children
fell
back
for
support
upon
the
resources
of
their
own
clan
hence
the
singular
feature
that
each
household
got
its
livelihood
from
two
distinct
groups
of
the
home
which
we
have
entered
belonged
to
the
quarters
of
the
gourd
people
or
clan
tanyi
hanutsh
from
which
the
mother
descended
and
okoya
had
slept
at
night
in
the
estufa
of
that
cluster
ever
since
his
thirteenth
year
but
the
cultivated
patch
which
the
father
tilled
pertained
to
the
fields
of
his
clan
that
of
water
tzitz
hanutsh
though
the
water
people
were
his
relatives
the
crop
raised
by
him
found
its
way
into
the
storeroom
of
tanyi
for
the
support
of
the
family
which
he
claimed
as
his
own
okoya
mother
scanned
her
boys
with
a
sober
glance
and
turned
back
into
the
kitchen
without
uttering
a
word
soon
a
grating
sound
issued
from
that
apartment
indicating
that
toasted
corn
was
being
ground
on
the
flat
slab
called
in
queres
and
now
usually
termed
in
new
mexico
the
boys
meanwhile
had
approached
a
niche
in
the
wall
each
one
took
a
pinch
of
yellow
cornmeal
from
the
painted
bowl
and
scattered
it
successively
to
the
north
west
south
east
then
threw
a
little
of
it
up
in
the
air
and
to
the
ground
before
him
during
this
performance
their
lips
moved
as
if
in
prayer
then
they
separated
for
the
spirits
had
been
appealed
to
and
their
entrance
into
their
home
was
under
the
special
protection
of
those
above
shyuote
whose
trout
had
been
ruined
during
the
combat
with
the
girls
threw
himself
on
the
roll
in
the
corner
there
to
mourn
over
his
defeat
okoya
went
out
into
the
both
expected
an
early
meal
for
the
fire
crackled
in
the
dark
kitchen
and
a
clapping
of
hands
gave
evidence
that
were
being
moulded
to
appease
their
hungry
stomachs
the
had
become
very
quiet
even
the
children
had
gone
to
rest
in
a
shady
place
where
they
slept
in
a
promiscuous
heap
a
conglomerate
of
human
bodies
heads
and
limbs
intermingled
the
form
of
an
old
man
rose
out
of
a
hatchway
in
the
and
a
tall
figure
slightly
stooping
clad
in
a
garment
and
with
a
head
of
iron
gray
hair
stood
on
the
flat
roof
he
walked
toward
a
beam
leading
down
into
the
court
seized
its
upper
end
and
descended
with
his
face
toward
the
wall
but
without
faltering
a
few
steps
along
the
house
brought
him
in
front
of
okoya
who
had
squatted
near
the
doorway
of
his
mother
dwelling
the
youth
was
so
absorbed
in
gloomy
thoughts
that
the
man
appearance
was
unexpected
starting
in
surprise
and
hastily
rising
okoya
called
into
the
house
yaya
sa
umo
my
grandfather
the
old
man
gave
a
friendly
nod
to
his
grandchild
and
crossed
the
threshold
stooping
low
still
lower
the
tall
form
had
to
bend
while
entering
the
kitchen
door
he
announced
his
coming
to
the
inmate
in
a
husky
voice
and
the
common
formula
guatzena
raua
the
woman
replied
her
father
squatted
close
to
the
fire
and
fixed
his
gaze
on
his
daughter
she
knelt
on
the
floor
busy
spreading
dough
or
thick
batter
on
a
heated
slab
over
the
fire
she
was
baking
the
as
they
are
called
after
a
short
pause
the
old
man
quietly
inquired
my
child
where
is
your
husband
zashue
tihua
the
woman
answered
without
looking
up
or
interrupting
her
work
is
in
the
fields
when
will
he
come
the
woman
raised
her
right
hand
and
pointed
to
the
hole
in
the
wall
whence
light
came
in
from
the
outside
the
wall
faced
the
west
and
the
height
of
the
loophole
corresponded
to
that
of
the
sun
about
one
hour
before
sunset
give
food
to
the
children
directed
the
old
man
when
they
have
eaten
and
are
gone
i
shall
speak
to
you
the
fire
crackled
and
blazed
and
ruddy
flashes
shot
across
the
features
of
the
woman
was
it
a
mere
reflection
of
the
fire
or
had
her
features
quivered
and
coloured
the
old
man
scanned
those
features
with
a
cold
steady
look
she
removed
from
the
fire
the
sooty
pot
of
clay
in
which
venison
cut
in
small
pieces
was
stewing
together
with
corn
dark
beans
and
a
few
roots
and
herbs
as
seasoning
then
she
called
out
shyuote
come
and
eat
where
is
okoya
the
latter
alone
heard
the
invitation
for
shyuote
had
gone
to
sleep
on
the
hides
the
elder
brother
shook
him
and
went
into
the
kitchen
he
was
followed
by
the
child
who
staggered
from
drowsiness
the
mother
meanwhile
had
placed
on
the
floor
a
pile
of
beside
it
in
an
earthen
bowl
decorated
inside
and
out
with
geometrical
lines
steamed
the
stew
dinner
was
ready
the
table
spread
to
enjoy
this
meal
both
lads
squatted
but
shyuote
still
half
asleep
lost
his
balance
and
tumbled
over
angry
at
the
merriment
which
this
created
the
boy
hastily
grabbed
the
food
but
his
mother
interfered
do
be
so
greedy
uak
remember
those
above
she
said
and
shyuote
imitating
the
example
of
okoya
crossly
muttered
a
prayer
and
scattered
crumbs
before
him
then
only
both
fell
to
eating
this
was
done
by
simply
folding
a
slice
of
the
cake
to
form
a
primitive
ladle
and
dipping
the
contents
of
the
stew
out
with
it
thus
they
swallowed
meat
broth
and
finally
the
ladle
also
okoya
arose
first
uttering
a
plainly
audible
hoa
shyuote
ate
longer
at
last
he
wiped
his
mouth
with
the
seam
of
his
wrap
grumbled
something
intended
for
thanksgiving
and
strolled
back
to
his
resting
place
in
the
front
room
okoya
went
out
into
the
to
be
alone
with
his
forebodings
the
sight
of
his
mother
seemed
oppressive
to
him
after
the
boys
had
gone
the
woman
emptied
the
remainder
of
the
stew
back
into
the
pot
filled
the
painted
bowl
with
water
and
put
both
vessels
in
a
corner
then
she
sat
down
leaning
against
the
wall
looking
directly
toward
her
father
her
face
was
thin
and
wan
her
cheeks
were
hollow
and
her
eyes
had
a
suppressed
look
of
uneasiness
the
old
man
remained
quietly
indifferent
as
long
as
the
meal
lasted
then
he
rose
peeped
cautiously
into
the
outer
apartment
resumed
his
seat
and
spoke
in
a
low
tone
is
it
true
that
you
have
listened
to
kamonyitza
corn
the
woman
started
who
says
so
she
answered
with
sudden
haste
the
koshare
replied
the
old
man
looking
at
her
with
a
cold
steady
gaze
what
do
i
care
for
them
exclaimed
his
daughter
her
lips
curled
with
an
air
of
disdain
it
may
be
spoke
her
father
in
measured
tones
that
you
do
not
wish
to
hear
from
them
but
i
know
that
they
care
for
your
doings
let
them
do
as
they
please
woman
he
warned
speak
not
thus
their
disposition
toward
you
is
not
a
matter
for
indifference
what
reason
have
they
to
follow
my
path
i
am
a
woman
like
many
others
in
the
tribe
nothing
more
or
less
i
stay
with
my
husband
she
went
on
with
greater
animation
i
do
my
duty
what
have
the
delight
makers
to
say
that
might
not
be
for
my
good
and
yet
you
are
not
precious
to
them
neither
are
they
precious
to
me
she
cried
her
eyes
sparkled
her
father
heaved
a
deep
sigh
he
shook
his
head
and
said
in
a
husky
tone
woman
your
ways
are
wrong
i
know
it
and
the
koshare
know
it
also
they
may
know
more
much
more
than
i
could
wish
he
added
and
looked
into
her
eyes
with
a
searching
sorrowful
glance
an
awful
suspicion
lay
in
this
penetrating
look
her
face
flushed
she
bent
her
head
to
avoid
his
gaze
to
the
gloomy
talk
succeeded
a
still
more
gloomy
silence
then
the
woman
lifted
her
head
and
began
entreatingly
my
father
i
do
not
ask
you
to
tell
me
how
you
come
to
know
all
this
but
tell
me
umo
what
are
these
delight
makers
the
koshare
at
every
dance
they
appear
and
always
make
merry
the
people
feel
glad
when
they
see
them
they
must
be
very
wise
they
know
of
everything
going
on
and
drag
it
before
the
people
to
excite
their
mirth
at
the
expense
of
others
how
is
it
that
they
know
so
much
i
am
but
a
woman
and
the
ways
of
the
men
are
not
mine
she
raised
her
face
and
her
eyes
flamed
but
since
i
hear
that
the
delight
makers
wish
me
no
good
i
want
to
know
at
least
what
those
enemies
of
mine
are
the
old
man
lowered
his
glance
and
sighed
my
child
he
began
softly
when
i
was
young
and
a
boy
like
your
son
okoya
i
cared
little
about
the
koshare
now
i
have
learned
more
he
leaned
his
head
against
the
wall
pressed
his
lips
firmly
together
and
continued
the
holders
of
the
paths
of
our
lives
those
who
can
close
them
when
the
time
comes
for
us
to
go
to
shipapu
where
there
is
neither
sorrow
nor
pain
have
many
agents
among
us
p
yatyama
our
father
and
sanashtyaya
our
mother
saw
that
the
world
existed
ere
there
was
light
and
so
the
tribe
lived
in
the
dark
four
are
the
wombs
in
which
people
grew
up
and
lived
ere
maseua
and
oyoy
u
his
brother
led
them
to
where
we
are
now
and
this
world
which
is
round
like
a
shield
is
the
fourth
womb
the
woman
listened
with
childlike
eagerness
her
parted
lips
and
sparkling
eyes
testified
that
everything
was
new
to
her
father
she
interrupted
i
knew
nothing
of
this
you
are
very
wise
but
why
are
women
never
told
such
things
do
cut
off
my
speech
he
said
because
women
are
so
forward
that
is
why
many
things
are
concealed
from
them
but
she
continued
heedless
of
his
rebuke
where
are
the
other
three
worlds
this
question
i
shall
answer
he
said
for
it
is
wise
in
you
to
speak
so
haatze
the
earth
is
round
and
flat
but
it
is
also
thick
like
a
cake
the
other
three
wombs
are
down
below
inside
one
beneath
the
other
at
shipapu
the
people
came
out
upon
this
world
which
is
the
fourth
womb
but
it
was
cold
and
dark
then
the
great
sun
rose
in
the
heavens
above
in
it
p
yatyama
dwells
and
on
it
he
rides
around
the
world
in
one
day
and
one
night
to
see
everything
which
happens
it
is
day
and
light
night
and
dark
we
have
also
summer
and
heat
winter
and
cold
for
this
reason
there
are
and
some
who
like
to
live
when
it
is
cold
and
others
who
enjoy
the
heat
every
tribe
every
clan
has
some
of
both
kinds
thus
they
came
out
of
the
third
world
and
thus
they
have
remained
until
this
day
it
was
cold
at
shipapu
when
the
people
came
out
on
the
surface
and
those
above
saw
that
they
felt
weak
toward
the
south
it
was
warm
and
bright
so
maseua
and
his
brother
said
to
their
children
the
men
of
our
tribe
you
where
there
is
more
light
and
the
summer
people
they
directed
to
go
along
the
rio
grande
the
winter
people
they
sent
south
also
but
far
around
by
the
east
over
the
plains
where
the
great
buffalo
is
roaming
where
the
wind
blows
and
it
is
cold
and
dry
to
both
kinds
of
men
they
said
besides
together
in
the
mountains
and
live
there
in
peace
each
one
getting
food
for
himself
and
others
as
you
are
wont
to
do
but
lest
the
people
might
get
weary
on
their
long
journey
maseua
and
his
brother
commanded
that
from
shipapu
there
should
come
forth
a
man
whose
body
was
painted
white
and
black
and
who
carried
on
his
head
dried
instead
of
feathers
this
man
began
at
once
to
dance
to
jump
and
to
tumble
so
that
the
people
laughed
and
their
hearts
became
glad
this
man
led
the
southward
and
as
often
as
they
grew
tired
he
danced
again
and
made
jests
and
the
tribe
followed
him
until
they
came
to
where
we
are
now
and
all
met
again
the
never
suffered
hunger
in
all
their
wanderings
for
their
leader
was
precious
and
wherever
they
went
he
caused
the
fruits
to
be
ripe
that
man
was
the
koshare
since
that
time
there
have
been
koshare
in
every
tribe
their
task
it
is
to
keep
the
people
happy
and
merry
but
they
must
also
fast
mortify
themselves
and
pray
to
those
above
that
every
kind
of
fruit
may
ripen
in
its
time
even
the
fruit
in
woman
womb
to
them
is
given
the
yellow
flower
from
the
fertile
bottoms
which
makes
the
hearts
of
men
glad
now
you
know
what
the
koshare
are
and
he
added
emphatically
why
you
should
not
laugh
and
make
merry
when
you
are
not
precious
to
them
the
woman
had
listened
with
breathless
attention
at
the
close
however
she
hung
her
head
and
sighed
the
old
man
gazed
at
her
in
silence
in
the
outer
room
the
regular
breathings
of
the
sleeping
boy
were
heard
otherwise
all
was
as
still
as
a
grave
at
last
she
lifted
her
face
again
father
she
asked
are
those
who
are
precious
to
the
holders
of
our
paths
are
they
always
good
i
need
not
tell
you
about
this
he
replied
fixing
upon
her
a
penetrating
glance
i
know
of
nothing
evil
she
stammered
unless
it
be
bad
men
and
yet
you
have
used
owl
feathers
her
face
grew
pale
she
asked
hoarsely
where
should
i
keep
them
the
koshare
know
it
was
the
equally
husky
reply
she
started
her
eyes
gleamed
like
living
coals
have
the
koshare
sent
you
here
father
no
was
the
gloomy
answer
but
if
the
old
men
come
to
me
and
say
the
witch
i
must
do
it
for
you
know
i
am
maseua
and
whatever
the
principals
command
i
must
do
even
if
it
takes
the
life
of
my
only
child
the
woman
rose
to
her
feet
her
attitude
was
one
of
defiance
let
the
koshare
speak
and
do
you
as
you
are
commanded
the
time
must
come
when
i
shall
have
to
die
the
sooner
it
comes
the
sooner
shall
i
find
rest
and
peace
with
our
mother
at
shipapu
her
father
also
had
risen
he
clutched
his
cotton
garment
as
if
a
sudden
chill
went
through
his
body
without
a
word
he
turned
and
went
off
dejected
stooping
with
a
heavy
sigh
the
woman
dropped
to
the
floor
beside
the
hearth
with
a
plaintive
moan
she
drew
her
hair
over
her
face
weep
she
could
not
the
embers
on
the
hearth
glowed
again
casting
a
dull
light
over
the
chamber
say
koitza
as
this
wretched
woman
was
called
was
the
only
child
of
him
with
whom
she
had
just
had
this
dismal
interview
his
name
was
topanashka
tihua
and
he
was
maseua
or
of
the
tribe
in
times
of
peace
the
maseua
is
subordinate
to
the
tapop
or
civil
governor
and
as
often
as
the
latter
communicates
to
him
any
decision
of
the
tribal
council
he
is
bound
to
execute
it
otherwise
the
maseua
is
really
a
superior
functionary
for
he
stands
in
direct
relation
to
the
religious
powers
of
which
we
shall
hereafter
speak
and
these
in
reality
guide
and
command
through
oracles
and
prophetic
utterances
in
war
the
maseua
has
supreme
command
and
the
civil
chief
and
the
diviners
or
must
obey
him
implicitly
as
soon
as
any
campaign
is
started
topanashka
was
a
man
of
great
physical
vigour
notwithstanding
his
age
he
was
highly
respected
for
his
skill
and
bravery
and
for
his
stern
rectitude
and
obedience
to
strict
duty
he
feared
nothing
except
the
supernatural
powers
of
evil
there
is
nothing
the
indian
fears
nay
hates
so
much
as
sorcery
topanashka
could
scarcely
believe
that
his
daughter
had
tampered
with
magic
by
causing
the
corn
to
speak
and
keeping
owl
feathers
in
her
possession
still
if
such
were
really
the
case
he
knew
of
no
other
course
to
pursue
but
to
execute
the
penalty
which
according
to
indian
ideas
she
deserved
and
which
the
leading
men
of
the
tribe
composing
its
council
would
undoubtedly
mete
out
to
her
death
a
cruel
terrible
death
but
she
was
his
only
child
and
ere
he
placed
faith
in
the
suspicion
communicated
to
him
in
secret
by
one
of
the
shamans
in
the
tribe
he
wanted
to
satisfy
himself
from
her
own
behaviour
whether
it
was
true
or
not
to
his
deepest
sorrow
say
koitza
behaviour
seemed
to
prove
that
she
was
not
falsely
accused
it
was
a
terrible
blow
to
the
old
man
who
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
rose
from
a
task
bewildered
and
hopeless
duty
was
to
him
paramount
and
yet
he
could
not
utterly
stifle
the
longing
to
save
his
only
child
from
a
cruel
and
ignominious
fate
his
daughter
too
felt
utterly
wretched
and
despondent
in
the
highest
degree
for
the
accusation
against
her
was
true
she
had
practised
the
dread
art
and
yet
strange
to
say
while
conscious
of
guilt
in
the
bottom
of
her
heart
she
felt
herself
innocent
let
us
recall
the
past
life
of
the
unhappy
being
to
see
whether
there
is
in
it
anything
to
explain
this
apparent
anomaly
when
say
koitza
was
fourteen
years
of
age
her
husband
zashue
tihua
began
to
pay
her
his
first
attentions
he
called
at
her
mother
home
oftener
than
any
other
youth
of
her
tribe
and
one
afternoon
when
she
was
returning
from
the
brook
with
a
jar
filled
with
water
on
her
head
he
stopped
her
dipped
some
water
out
of
the
urn
drank
it
and
whispered
something
to
which
she
gave
no
reply
hurrying
home
as
rapidly
as
possible
she
could
not
speak
to
her
mother
about
this
for
her
mother
was
hopelessly
deaf
and
it
would
not
have
been
proper
to
consult
her
father
since
the
father
belonged
of
course
to
another
clan
a
whole
night
and
one
full
day
say
pondered
over
the
case
at
last
her
mind
was
made
up
the
girl
took
a
dish
filled
with
and
rolls
of
sweet
paste
of
the
and
placed
it
on
her
head
with
this
load
she
climbed
up
the
rugged
slope
leading
to
the
dwellings
of
the
water
clan
to
which
zashue
belonged
the
lad
was
sitting
in
the
cave
inhabited
by
his
family
busying
himself
with
straightening
arrow
shafts
over
the
fire
when
the
girl
pushing
before
her
the
loaded
tray
crept
through
the
silently
she
placed
the
food
before
him
and
went
out
again
without
a
word
this
was
her
affirmative
reply
to
his
wooing
thereafter
zashue
visited
the
quarters
of
the
gourd
people
at
the
big
house
every
night
along
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
in
soft
ground
and
in
a
lonely
sheltered
spot
he
meanwhile
planted
four
stakes
connected
by
from
end
to
end
cotton
threads
were
drawn
lengthwise
and
here
zashue
wove
a
cotton
wrap
day
after
day
the
girl
would
steal
out
to
this
place
also
carrying
food
to
the
young
artisan
she
would
cleanse
his
hair
while
they
chatted
quietly
shyly
at
first
about
the
present
and
the
future
when
the
mantle
was
done
and
it
looked
white
and
firm
zashue
brought
it
to
say
koitza
mother
who
forthwith
understood
the
intention
of
his
gift
and
felt
gratified
at
the
prospect
of
securing
a
who
possessed
cotton
the
plant
was
not
cultivated
near
the
upper
rio
grande
at
that
time
and
had
to
be
obtained
from
the
far
south
by
barter
many
journeys
distant
pueblo
indians
lived
also
and
thither
the
queres
went
at
long
intervals
to
trade
and
to
hunt
the
buffalo
on
the
southwestern
plains
topanashka
also
was
pleased
with
the
suitor
in
due
course
of
time
zashue
tihua
and
say
koitza
therefore
became
man
and
wife
illustration

a
cliff
estufa
of
the
zashue
proved
to
be
a
good
husband
according
to
indian
ideas
he
worked
and
hunted
dutifully
providing
the
storerooms
of
tanyi
hanutsh
with
supplies
of
which
his
wife
and
through
her
he
also
enjoyed
the
benefit
he
spun
cotton
and
wove
it
into
wraps
scarfs
and
sashes
furthermore
he
was
always
and
merry
he
did
not
spend
too
many
nights
out
of
his
wife
home
either
they
had
three
children
okoya
shyuote
and
a
little
girl
of
these
shyuote
became
the
favourite
for
when
the
child
was
yet
small
it
happened
that
his
father
made
a
vow
to
make
a
koshare
of
him
zashue
was
a
delight
maker
himself
and
one
of
the
merriest
of
that
singular
crew
among
them
he
was
perhaps
the
most
popular
for
while
his
strength
and
agility
enabled
him
to
perform
in
a
conspicuous
manner
and
his
ready
wit
and
quick
conception
of
everything
ludicrous
caused
him
to
shine
as
a
great
light
among
that
society
of
official
jesters
so
the
two
lived
in
quiet
and
sober
content
zashue
was
pleased
with
his
spouse
she
kept
her
looks
well
with
advancing
years
and
while
there
is
never
among
indians
that
complete
intimacy
between
man
and
wife
which
engenders
fidelity
under
all
circumstances
while
a
certain
freedom
of
action
is
always
permitted
to
the
man
toward
the
other
sex
say
had
natural
tact
enough
to
never
pry
into
such
matters
she
in
turn
did
her
duty
always
at
home
she
faithfully
fulfilled
her
obligations
as
head
of
the
house
and
naturally
shrank
from
all
society
but
that
of
her
own
sex
and
such
men
as
were
allied
to
her
by
near
ties
of
relationship
when
she
told
her
father
in
that
sad
interview
that
she
was
faithful
to
her
husband
say
had
told
the
truth
and
yet
there
was
something
that
caused
her
to
plead
guilty
the
family
had
lived
contentedly
and
no
cloud
appeared
to
hang
over
them
until
a
few
years
previous
to
the
date
of
our
story
say
koitza
fell
ill
from
want
of
proper
care
mountain
fever
is
not
infrequently
fatal
and
it
was
mountain
fever
that
had
seized
upon
the
delicate
frame
of
the
little
woman
this
fever
is
often
tenacious
and
intermittent
sometimes
it
is
congestive
indian
medicine
may
cure
a
slight
attack
and
prevent
too
frequent
returns
of
more
violent
ones
but
if
the
case
is
a
serious
one
indian
remedies
are
of
no
avail
say
suffered
from
a
slight
attack
at
first
and
recovered
from
it
a
primitive
treatment
was
effective
for
the
time
being
but
in
the
year
ensuing
fever
set
in
again
and
no
sudorific
was
of
any
use
she
tried
a
decoction
of
willow
bark
but
it
did
her
no
good
she
took
the
root
of
the
yucca
or
soapweed
and
drank
the
froth
produced
by
whipping
water
with
it
but
gained
no
relief
the
poor
woman
did
not
know
that
these
remedies
are
not
employed
by
the
indians
in
a
case
like
hers
but
only
for
toothache
and
in
the
case
of
soapweed
for
consumption
thus
it
went
on
for
three
years
during
the
dry
seasons
there
were
no
signs
of
the
illness
but
as
soon
as
in
july
or
august
thunderstorms
shed
their
moisture
over
the
mountains
and
chilly
nights
alternated
with
warm
sunshine
the
fever
made
its
appearance
two
years
before
the
rainy
season
had
lasted
unusually
long
and
it
was
followed
immediately
by
the
attacks
from
the
disease
were
therefore
unusually
violent
and
by
november
say
koitza
thought
herself
dying
from
weakness
and
exhaustion
her
condition
was
such
that
her
husband
felt
alarmed
and
every
effort
was
made
to
relieve
her
by
the
aid
of
such
arts
as
the
indian
believes
in
the
chief
or
great
shaman
of
the
tribe
had
to
come
and
see
the
patient
pray
by
her
side
and
then
go
home
to
fast
and
mortify
himself
for
four
consecutive
days
his
efforts
had
no
effect
whatever
every
indigenous
medicine
that
was
thought
of
had
been
already
used
and
none
had
been
of
any
avail
at
last
the
shaman
encouraged
by
the
many
blue
and
green
stones
cotton
wraps
and
quantities
of
corn
meal
which
zashue
tihua
contributed
in
reward
of
his
juggleries
resolved
to
make
a
final
trial
by
submitting
himself
and
his
associates
to
the
dangerous
ordeal
of
for
the
invalid
sake
this
ceremony
was
always
performed
by
a
certain
group
of
called
therefore
hakanyi
chayani
or
fire
shamans
the
hishtanyi
chayan
was
their
official
head
and
he
with
the
four
others
belonging
to
the
crew
fasted
rigorously
for
four
days
and
nights
then
they
went
to
the
house
of
say
koitza
and
in
her
presence
sang
the
powerful
song
while
each
one
of
them
in
turn
waved
a
burning
bunch
of
long
dry
grass
to
the
six
sacred
regions
and
each
time
bit
off
a
piece
of
the
burning
weed
and
chewed
it
when
all
had
gone
through
the
performances
and
their
mouths
were
well
filled
with
ashes
each
one
gravely
stepped
up
to
the
invalid
and
spat
the
contents
of
his
mouth
in
her
face
then
they
departed
as
quietly
as
they
had
come
and
went
home
to
await
the
results
of
the
wonderful
remedy
it
was
a
last
a
supreme
effort
the
condition
of
say
could
not
fail
to
arouse
the
sympathies
of
her
own
sex
even
outside
of
her
clan
many
were
the
calls
from
compassionate
women
they
would
drop
in
squat
down
tender
their
services
suggest
remedies
and
gossip
only
one
woman
made
herself
directly
useful
and
that
was
shotaye
a
member
of
the
water
clan
shotaye
was
a
strange
woman
nobody
liked
her
and
yet
many
applied
to
her
for
relief
in
secret
for
shotaye
possessed
great
knowledge
of
plants
and
other
remedies
and
she
had
a
keen
practical
sense
but
people
dreaded
her
she
lived
alone
in
her
cave
among
the
abodes
of
the
water
people
and
nobody
knew
but
she
might
know
more
than
the
official
themselves
in
short
the
majority
of
the
tribe
believed
that
shotaye
was
a
witch
but
the
woman
was
so
wary
that
nobody
could
prove
her
to
be
one
shotaye
was
not
an
old
woman
her
appearance
was
not
in
the
least
repulsive
on
the
contrary
the
men
knew
that
the
woman
showed
no
objections
to
occasional
attentions
even
to
intimacy
for
this
reason
also
she
was
not
popular
among
her
own
sex
shotaye
had
had
a
husband
once
but
he
had
left
her
and
was
living
with
another
woman
that
husband
was
called
tyope
badger
a
man
of
strong
physique
and
one
averse
to
monotony
in
conjugal
life
tyope
was
a
scheming
man
cunning
and
unscrupulous
in
the
highest
degree
shotaye
an
energetic
woman
endowed
with
a
powerful
will
of
her
own
had
there
not
been
the
little
cloud
of
marital
inconstancy
on
both
sides
the
pair
would
have
been
for
good
as
well
as
for
evil
tyope
was
a
koshare
rather
than
an
agriculturist
he
spent
his
time
mostly
in
other
people
homes
and
in
the
estufa
of
the
delight
makers
leaving
his
wife
to
provide
for
herself
and
for
him
also
whenever
he
chose
to
remain
at
her
house
in
short
there
were
flaws
on
both
sides
and
shotaye
being
the
held
the
main
power
one
fine
evening
when
tyope
presented
himself
in
the
grotto
occupied
by
his
wife
she
refused
to
recognize
him
any
longer
he
protested
he
stormed
he
menaced
her
it
was
of
no
avail
shotaye
told
him
to
go
and
he
left
henceforth
the
two
were
mortal
enemies
the
woman
said
little
but
he
was
bent
upon
her
destruction
by
every
possible
means
she
kept
on
the
defensive
avoided
all
conflicts
and
was
very
careful
not
to
give
any
cause
for
a
direct
accusation
of
sorcery
she
cured
people
incidentally
never
asking
any
compensation
for
it
she
lived
alone
and
thus
earned
enough
to
be
independent
of
her
own
clan
if
need
be
this
woman
called
on
say
occasionally
but
only
between
the
periods
of
the
attacks
of
fever
on
such
visits
she
would
assist
the
patient
do
the
housework
and
arrange
the
hides
or
covers
for
her
say
harboured
a
wish
to
consult
her
about
her
disease
but
shotaye
studiously
avoided
any
opportunity
for
confidential
talk
one
day
however
when
the
two
were
alone
in
the
kitchen
and
the
invalid
felt
somewhat
relieved
she
opened
her
heart
to
her
visitor
shotaye
listened
very
attentively
and
when
say
had
concluded
instead
of
asking
for
further
details
she
abruptly
asked
whether
say
had
no
suspicion
of
being
bewitched
if
such
a
question
were
put
to
us
we
should
doubt
the
sanity
of
the
questioner
not
so
the
indian
say
felt
like
one
from
whose
eyes
thick
scales
are
suddenly
removed
indeed
she
thought
this
was
the
cause
of
her
evil
this
alone
could
explain
the
tenacity
of
the
disease
its
mysterious
intermittence
she
told
her
interlocutor
that
she
must
be
right
or
else
why
these
regular
returns
and
always
during
the
season
of
rain
shotaye
listened
and
listened
every
word
she
heard
was
in
confirmation
of
her
own
thoughts
say
must
be
under
the
influence
of
some
evil
charm
and
unless
counteracted
by
magic
it
was
clear
to
her
that
the
poor
woman
must
succumb
to
its
workings
whatever
there
is
in
nature
which
the
indian
can
not
grasp
at
once
he
attributes
to
mysterious
supernatural
agencies
he
believes
that
nature
is
pervaded
by
spiritual
essence
individualized
into
an
infinite
number
of
distinct
powers
everything
in
nature
has
a
soul
according
to
him
and
it
is
that
soul
which
causes
it
to
move
or
to
act
upon
its
surroundings
in
general
thus
the
medical
properties
of
animals
of
plants
or
minerals
are
due
to
spiritual
manifestations
his
medical
art
therefore
does
not
consist
merely
in
eliminating
the
physical
cause
of
disease
as
soon
as
any
disease
is
stubborn
there
must
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
some
spiritual
source
and
this
source
can
be
discovered
and
removed
only
by
magic
incantations
therefore
form
an
important
part
of
indian
medicine
the
formulas
therefor
are
the
special
property
of
the
whom
we
shall
hereafter
designate
with
the
much
more
appropriate
name
of
shamans
the
shaman
is
wizard
and
physician
at
the
same
time
he
is
also
a
prophet
augur
and
oracle
his
duty
it
is
not
only
to
protect
from
evil
but
to
counteract
it
he
has
charms
and
incantations
which
he
offers
for
the
production
of
beneficial
natural
phenomena
magic
for
such
purposes
is
regarded
by
the
indian
as
essential
to
the
existence
of
man
magic
however
as
a
black
art
is
the
most
heinous
crime
which
he
can
conceive
the
difference
between
the
two
consists
mainly
in
their
purpose
the
manipulations
are
substantially
the
same
so
are
the
objects
to
know
those
details
is
one
of
the
attributes
of
the
shamans
the
latter
constitute
a
circle
of
their
own
a
cluster
of
adepts
nominally
in
the
arts
of
healing
but
really
in
the
arts
of
magic
that
circle
is
wide
and
whoever
stands
outside
of
it
has
no
right
to
infringe
upon
the
duties
of
its
members
by
attempting
to
follow
their
example
it
is
an
institution
and
its
origin
dates
from
untold
centuries
it
is
subdivided
into
groups
each
of
which
practises
charms
incantations
or
magic
relating
to
certain
human
interests
the
shyayak
are
in
possession
of
the
spell
which
charms
game
in
other
words
they
are
the
shamans
of
the
hunt
the
uakanyi
practise
magic
in
warfare
they
are
the
shamans
of
war
the
chayani
are
physicians
who
combine
with
the
knowledge
of
medicine
proper
the
knowledge
of
magic
curative
powers
they
are
the
shamans
of
medicine
lastly
the
yaya
combine
a
knowledge
of
all
these
different
branches
in
their
essence
they
are
the
prophets
and
priests
these
groups
may
be
described
as
in
a
certain
sense
guilds
but
they
are
secret
societies
also
inasmuch
as
the
arts
and
practices
of
each
are
special
property
which
is
kept
secret
from
the
others
and
from
the
uninitiated
members
in
the
tribe
in
order
to
become
a
member
of
a
society
of
that
kind
secrecy
is
required
and
long
apprenticeship
the
novice
rises
slowly
from
one
degree
of
knowledge
to
another
and
only
few
attain
the
higher
positions
the
members
of
these
secret
societies
are
therefore
magicians
or
wizards
and
when
any
one
dreads
danger
from
evil
sorcery
it
is
his
duty
to
consult
the
proper
shaman
for
relief
unless
he
should
be
sure
of
the
person
of
the
sorcerer
in
which
case
he
may
kill
him
outright
without
even
mentioning
the
deed
in
the
present
instance
say
could
not
resort
to
such
a
summary
expedient
it
was
therefore
the
duty
of
shotaye
who
was
better
informed
on
institutions
and
customs
to
direct
her
sick
friend
to
a
shaman
but
shotaye
was
not
on
good
terms
with
the
official
wizards
particularly
the
chayani
those
who
cured
and
still
less
with
the
highest
religious
powers
the
yaya
it
suited
her
pride
to
attempt
the
experiment
at
her
own
risk
conscious
all
the
while
that
it
was
dangerous
dangerous
for
herself
as
well
as
for
her
patient
for
it
entailed
performances
which
only
the
shaman
can
undertake
and
should
they
be
detected
the
very
crime
of
sorcery
against
which
their
experiments
were
directed
would
be
charged
against
them
shotaye
had
still
another
reason
for
not
encouraging
her
friend
to
speak
to
the
higher
chayani
the
fever
coincided
with
the
rainy
season
as
soon
as
this
was
over
it
subsided
natural
as
this
was
both
women
attributed
it
to
a
mysterious
cause
and
shotaye
suspicious
and
vindictive
even
thought
she
had
discovered
a
clew
to
the
guilty
party
the
rainy
season
in
new
mexico
is
of
course
essential
to
the
growth
of
the
chief
staple
of
the
indian
maize
or
indian
corn
when
therefore
in
july
daily
showers
should
occur
the
principal
shamans
of
each
tribe
and
the
yaya
must
pray
fast
and
mortify
themselves
in
order
that
those
above
may
send
the
needed
rain
the
hishtanyi
chayan
scatters
the
powder
of
the
white
flower
to
the
winds
meanwhile
murmuring
incantations
at
night
he
imitates
thunder
by
whirling
a
flint
knife
attached
to
the
end
of
a
long
string
and
draws
brilliant
flashes
from
pebbles
which
he
strikes
together
in
a
peculiar
manner
for
the
indian
reasons
that
since
rain
is
preceded
in
summer
by
lightning
and
thunder
man
by
imitating
those
heralds
is
calling
the
desired
precipitation
beckoning
it
to
come
this
is
the
time
of
the
year
when
the
koshare
perform
their
chief
work
four
days
and
four
nights
sometimes
longer
they
must
fast
and
pray
in
order
that
the
crops
may
obtain
the
moisture
indispensable
for
ripening
the
people
look
upon
the
delight
makers
with
a
degree
of
respect
akin
to
fear
at
all
times
for
they
are
regarded
as
powerful
intermediaries
in
matters
of
life
and
death
to
the
tribe
but
during
that
particular
time
they
are
considered
as
specially
precious
to
the
higher
powers
shotaye
hated
the
koshare
they
in
turn
disliked
the
woman
and
gave
vent
to
their
dislike
by
turning
her
into
ridicule
at
public
dances
as
often
as
possible
this
she
resented
greatly
but
she
was
powerless
to
retaliate
since
the
delight
makers
enjoy
special
privileges
on
festive
days
the
hatred
was
still
increased
by
the
fact
that
her
former
husband
tyope
was
a
leading
koshare
to
his
influence
she
attributed
the
insults
which
the
jesters
offered
her
and
she
saw
in
the
whole
group
but
a
crowd
of
willing
tools
handled
by
her
personal
enemy
since
say
illness
coincided
with
the
beginning
of
the
rainy
season
the
principal
activity
of
the
koshare
immediately
preceded
the
outbreak
of
the
fever
urged
by
hate
and
desire
for
revenge
shotaye
combined
the
two
facts
in
her
mind
and
drew
the
conclusion
that
the
disease
was
due
to
the
magic
power
of
the
koshare
directed
against
say
for
some
unknown
reason
and
purpose
if
the
koshare
were
guilty
it
was
not
only
useless
it
was
dangerous
even
to
call
upon
any
chayan
for
relief
the
delight
makers
were
the
chief
assistants
of
the
shamans
in
any
public
ceremony
and
indispensable
to
them
in
many
ways
beside
say
koitza
could
not
have
applied
to
a
chayan
without
her
husband
knowledge
and
that
husband
was
a
koshare
so
after
explaining
to
the
invalid
her
suspicions
and
inferences
she
suggested
direct
inquiry
about
the
principals
in
the
supposed
evil
actions
against
her
that
inquiry
could
be
conducted
only
through
sorcery
itself
and
say
at
first
trembled
she
feared
and
not
without
good
cause
an
appeal
to
evil
powers
still
shotaye
spoke
so
plausibly
she
assured
so
strongly
her
friend
of
her
own
discretion
and
fidelity
and
was
so
insistent
upon
her
constant
success
in
everything
she
had
undertaken
as
yet
that
the
woman
yielded
at
last
against
her
own
convictions
something
within
her
seemed
to
speak
and
say
do
not
tread
forbidden
paths
speak
to
your
husband
first
but
the
arguments
on
the
other
side
were
too
strong
her
own
physical
condition
too
weak
she
grasped
the
expected
relief
regardless
of
the
warnings
of
her
conscience
among
the
objects
connected
with
evil
magic
a
certain
kind
of
maize
had
the
power
of
speech
attributed
to
it
it
is
the
variety
called
in
the
queres
language
monyi
ears
of
this
corn
belonging
to
a
witch
are
said
to
speak
in
the
absence
of
their
owner
and
to
tell
of
her
whereabouts
and
doings
shotaye
knew
this
and
herself
but
indifferently
versed
in
the
black
art
concluded
that
the
black
corn
would
also
reveal
if
properly
handled
the
agent
whose
manipulations
caused
say
koitza
sufferings
she
hoped
also
that
by
combining
the
dreaded
grain
with
another
more
powerful
implement
of
sorcery
owl
plumage
she
would
succeed
in
eliciting
from
the
former
all
the
information
desired
the
woman
was
quite
ignorant
of
the
evil
ways
in
which
she
was
about
to
wander
but
she
was
bold
and
daring
and
the
hope
of
injuring
her
enemies
was
a
greater
inducement
than
the
desire
to
relieve
her
friend
the
proposed
manipulation
was
directed
in
fact
much
more
against
her
former
husband
than
against
the
disease
but
how
to
obtain
the
necessary
objects
how
to
secure
black
corn
and
how
and
where
to
get
the
feathers
of
an
owl
both
were
so
well
known
and
so
generally
tabooed
that
inquiry
after
them
would
forthwith
arouse
suspicion
black
maize
might
be
procured
on
the
sly
but
the
other
could
be
found
by
chance
only
by
meeting
with
the
body
of
a
dead
owl
on
the
heights
surrounding
the
tyuonyi
shotaye
was
in
the
habit
of
strolling
alone
all
around
the
rito
over
the
timbered
mesa
as
well
as
through
the
gorges
which
descend
from
the
mountains
on
such
excursions
the
woman
observed
the
most
minute
precautions
for
there
was
danger
danger
from
roaming
indians
of
the
navajo
or
dinne
tribe
and
danger
from
spies
of
her
own
tribe
frequently
people
had
followed
stealthily
in
the
hope
of
surprising
her
at
some
illicit
practice
but
she
had
been
lucky
enough
to
notice
them
in
time
of
what
is
called
the
mesa
del
rito
the
high
bordering
the
tyuonyi
on
the
south
shotaye
knew
every
inch
of
ground
every
tree
and
shrub
on
a
clear
cool
november
day
she
strolled
again
in
that
direction
climbing
the
heights
and
penetrating
into
the
scrubby
timber
interspersed
with
tall
pines
which
covers
the
plateau
for
miles
to
her
delight
she
discovered
the
remains
of
an
owl
at
no
great
distance
from
the
declivity
of
the
rito
beneath
a
rotten
pine
instead
of
picking
up
the
carcass
she
kicked
it
aside
disdainfully
but
took
good
care
to
notice
whither
so
as
to
remember
the
place
it
landed
on
a
and
remained
suspended
from
its
branches
shotaye
went
onward
carelessly
she
looked
for
herbs
and
plants
picking
up
a
handful
here
pulling
out
a
root
there
until
she
had
made
a
long
circuit
which
however
brought
her
back
to
the
place
where
the
dead
owl
was
here
she
stopped
listening
all
the
while
looking
out
for
plants
as
if
by
accident
she
neared
the
bush
on
which
the
carcass
was
still
hanging
and
after
assuring
herself
that
the
body
had
not
been
disturbed
she
brushed
past
so
as
to
cause
it
to
drop
to
the
ground
she
hastily
plucked
a
few
feathers
put
them
with
the
herbs
and
roots
already
gathered
and
turned
homeward
everything
was
quiet
and
still
around
her
only
at
a
short
distance
two
crows
flew
up
croaking
say
koitza
was
not
strong
enough
to
walk
up
to
the
cliffs
therefore
shotaye
when
she
came
to
announce
to
her
friend
that
the
necessary
material
was
at
last
secured
suggested
that
the
incantation
be
performed
at
the
home
of
the
invalid
a
certain
evening
when
zashue
was
sure
to
be
absent
owing
to
a
gathering
of
the
koshare
was
appointed
for
the
purpose
on
that
evening
the
two
women
sat
alone
in
the
kitchen
okoya
was
away
in
the
estufa
of
tanyi
hanutsh
the
two
younger
children
were
fast
asleep
in
the
outer
room
it
was
a
cold
night
but
the
fire
on
the
hearth
had
almost
completely
subsided
only
a
few
embers
remaining
through
the
loophole
in
the
wall
an
occasional
draught
of
chilly
air
entered
say
koitza
clung
to
her
friend
shoulder
shivering
and
trembling
from
fear
as
well
as
from
cold
in
the
centre
of
the
dark
room
shotaye
had
placed
a
few
ears
of
black
corn
and
on
them
two
bundles
of
owl
feathers
each
tied
to
a
chip
of
obsidian
she
had
also
brought
along
some
bark
of
the
red
willow
this
she
pulverized
in
the
hand
and
made
into
two
cigarettes
with
corn
husks
at
that
time
tobacco
was
unknown
to
the
pueblos
and
red
was
the
only
thing
used
for
smoking
while
smoking
itself
was
not
a
relish
but
exclusively
a
sacrifice
handing
one
of
the
cigarettes
to
her
friend
shotaye
directed
her
to
light
it
and
then
puff
the
smoke
successively
to
the
six
mythical
regions
after
this
she
was
to
cast
the
glowing
stub
on
the
pile
of
corn
and
feathers
with
a
shudder
say
koitza
obeyed
these
instructions
her
teeth
chattered
while
the
recited
an
invocation
then
both
huddled
together
to
listen
even
shotaye
felt
afraid
of
the
consequences
for
a
long
time
everything
was
silent
the
cold
draught
from
the
outside
had
stopped
the
women
sat
in
breathless
silence
they
listened
and
listened
nothing
moved
not
a
sound
was
heard
shotaye
overcame
her
first
anxiety
and
repeated
the
dread
formula
all
was
silent
suddenly
a
cold
blast
pervaded
the
room
again
it
fanned
the
embers
to
renewed
life
they
shed
a
faint
glimmer
over
the
chamber
the
women
started
there
was
a
crackling
heard
the
feathers
moved
the
ears
of
corn
seemed
to
change
position
one
of
the
feather
bunches
rolled
on
the
floor
they
nearly
screamed
in
terror
for
their
excited
imagination
caused
them
to
hear
ghostly
sounds
disconnected
uncomprehended
words
it
was
clear
that
the
black
corn
had
spoken
what
it
said
neither
could
tell
but
the
fact
of
having
heard
the
noise
was
sufficient
to
convince
them
that
say
was
under
the
influence
of
an
evil
charm
and
shotaye
took
care
to
add
that
that
charm
was
exercised
by
the
koshare
or
by
some
one
belonging
to
their
society
so
powerful
was
the
effect
of
this
incantation
scene
upon
say
that
she
fainted
after
a
while
she
recovered
and
shotaye
led
her
back
to
the
outer
room
where
after
some
time
she
began
to
slumber
from
sheer
exhaustion
then
the
returned
to
the
caves
taking
with
her
every
vestige
of
the
conjuration
it
was
wise
on
her
part
for
as
soon
as
say
awoke
from
feverish
and
anxious
dreams
her
first
thought
was
about
the
dismal
objects
everything
was
quiet
zashue
had
returned
and
was
quietly
asleep
by
her
side
she
arose
and
glided
into
the
kitchen
noiselessly
stealthily
the
floor
was
clean
she
felt
around
not
a
trace
of
the
objectionable
pile
could
be
noticed
unspeakable
was
the
feeling
of
relief
with
which
she
returned
to
her
husband
side
and
extended
herself
on
the
hides
again
sound
sleep
came
to
her
and
when
she
awoke
it
was
daylight
she
felt
stronger
brighter
yet
thereafter
as
often
as
zashue
approached
her
in
his
harmless
bantering
manner
she
experienced
a
strange
sudden
pang
she
was
reminded
of
having
done
wrong
in
not
having
been
open
with
him
the
indian
conscience
is
hemmed
in
by
bonds
arising
from
his
social
and
religious
organization
why
for
instance
should
she
have
told
her
spouse
he
was
neither
of
her
clan
nor
of
her
party
he
belonged
to
the
summer
people
she
to
those
of
winter
she
stood
outside
of
all
secret
associations
whereas
he
was
a
koshare
the
winter
following
proved
to
be
mild
and
dry
say
recovered
slowly
shotaye
kept
aloof
after
the
conjuration
for
a
long
time
at
least
all
of
a
sudden
she
made
her
appearance
at
the
home
of
her
convalescent
friend
it
was
in
order
to
remind
her
that
the
first
step
was
only
a
preliminary
and
that
it
could
not
effect
a
radical
cure
all
that
had
been
achieved
was
to
prove
that
an
evil
charm
existed
and
that
the
koshare
were
the
wrongdoers
it
remained
now
to
remove
the
spell
by
breaking
the
charm
this
she
represented
had
to
be
attempted
when
the
koshare
were
in
their
greatest
power
and
could
only
be
effected
by
means
of
the
owl
feathers
by
burying
these
feathers
near
the
place
where
the
delight
makers
used
to
assemble
shotaye
asserted
that
not
only
would
the
disease
be
eliminated
forever
but
the
guilty
one
be
punished
according
to
the
measure
of
his
crime
say
would
not
listen
to
any
such
proposals
she
saw
no
necessity
for
going
any
further
in
forbidden
tracks
now
that
her
health
was
restored
why
should
she
attempt
to
harm
a
cluster
of
men
to
which
her
husband
belonged
and
thus
perhaps
imperil
his
life
shotaye
met
this
objection
with
the
assurance
that
the
remedy
was
directed
against
the
guilty
ones
only
and
that
she
herself
did
not
for
a
moment
think
that
zashue
had
participated
in
the
evil
manipulations
against
his
wife
that
consequently
he
was
in
no
manner
exposed
to
danger
say
finally
told
her
visitor
that
she
would
wait
and
see
and
then
decide
winter
went
and
spring
came
warm
summer
followed
with
a
sky
and
sporadic
thunderclouds
all
the
crops
were
planted
irrigated
and
scantily
weeded
now
they
awaited
the
rains
in
order
to
complete
growth
and
prepare
for
maturity
the
great
chayani
had
gone
through
their
official
fasts
they
had
made
their
sacrificial
offerings
in
the
sacred
bowls
dedicated
to
every
day
clouds
loomed
up
in
the
west
distant
thunder
rumbled
but
not
a
drop
of
rain
fell
in
the
rito
and
the
people
began
to
look
gloomy
the
koshare
were
therefore
required
to
go
to
work
earlier
than
usual
they
were
to
fast
four
consecutive
days
between
two
full
moons
the
estufa
in
which
the
delight
makers
used
to
assemble
is
situated
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
cliffs
and
its
access
is
difficult
it
is
a
circular
chamber
in
the
rock
twenty
feet
in
diameter
at
present
the
outer
wall
has
fallen
in
but
a
crease
in
the
floor
indicates
the
place
where
a
little
led
into
the
cave
the
cave
lies
high
so
that
from
it
a
view
of
the
whole
valley
presents
itself
and
at
its
feet
opens
a
narrow
chasm
of
considerable
depth
this
is
a
mere
fissure
so
narrow
that
were
fastened
into
its
sides
like
the
rounds
of
a
and
on
these
the
people
ascended
to
a
narrow
trail
leading
up
to
the
entrance
other
were
scattered
along
this
trail
and
farther
below
they
were
inhabited
by
the
people
of
the
turquoise
clan
all
the
koshare
had
retired
to
this
secluded
spot
and
the
first
day
of
fasting
was
nearly
over
when
shotaye
called
once
more
at
the
home
of
say
the
latter
guessed
the
object
of
her
coming
and
felt
afraid
without
preamble
in
a
sober
way
the
stated
that
the
time
had
come
for
a
decisive
step
and
with
this
she
placed
three
bunches
of
owl
feathers
on
the
floor
in
vain
say
koitza
protested
affirming
that
her
health
was
fully
restored
shotaye
would
not
listen
to
refusal
or
excuse
now
or
never
she
commanded
she
repeated
her
former
assertion
that
the
charm
could
not
hurt
zashue
as
long
as
he
was
not
guilty
for
a
long
while
the
women
sat
arguing
the
matter
at
last
say
koitza
yielded
and
promised
to
comply
night
came
and
the
people
of
the
rito
went
to
rest
the
moon
rose
behind
the
of
the
tetilla
the
rocky
battlements
of
the
cliffs
shone
brightly
above
the
gorge
whose
depths
rested
in
dark
shadow
a
tiny
figure
crept
out
of
the
big
building
and
hurried
down
the
vale
along
the
fields
when
she
reached
the
grove
where
we
met
okoya
and
his
little
brother
for
the
first
time
she
crouched
beneath
a
tree
covered
her
head
and
sobbed
aloud
it
was
a
dire
task
for
say
koitza
this
errand
out
of
which
harm
might
arise
to
the
whole
cluster
to
which
her
husband
belonged
if
the
charm
which
she
clutched
with
trembling
fingers
should
work
against
him
then
he
was
the
guilty
party
so
shotaye
had
insinuated
and
the
word
had
stung
her
like
the
bite
of
a
serpent
it
came
back
to
her
mind
as
she
hurried
to
perform
the
deed
and
caused
her
to
start
she
rose
hastily
and
turned
toward
the
cliffs
the
uppermost
rocks
glistened
fairly
in
the
light
of
the
moon
and
where
the
sharp
line
of
the
shadows
commenced
the
ruddy
glow
of
a
fire
burst
from
an
oblong
aperture
there
was
the
estufa
of
the
koshare
from
it
issued
the
sound
of
hollow
drumming
intermingled
with
the
cadence
of
a
chorus
of
hoarse
voices
a
thrill
went
through
say
she
stopped
again
and
listened
was
not
her
husband
voice
among
them
certainly
he
was
there
doing
his
duty
with
the
rest
and
if
he
was
as
guilty
toward
her
as
the
others
that
monstrous
thought
rose
again
it
pushed
her
onward
she
crawled
ahead
slowly
scarcely
conscious
of
the
danger
attending
her
mission
large
blocks
of
débris
erosive
hillocks
impeded
her
progress
they
crowded
along
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
like
protecting
bulwarks
and
the
trail
wound
around
them
on
a
higher
plane
but
this
trail
she
dared
not
follow
there
was
not
enough
darkness
on
it
she
crept
along
the
base
the
sense
of
danger
coming
to
her
with
the
increasing
obscurity
until
suddenly
she
stood
before
a
cleft
of
almost
inky
hue
here
she
remembered
was
the
ascent
to
the
estufa
here
she
had
to
perform
the
work
and
here
overpowered
by
emotion
and
excitement
she
dropped
behind
an
angular
block
of
stone
unconscious
when
she
recovered
the
chorus
sounded
directly
above
her
and
the
chant
seemed
to
soar
away
like
voices
from
an
upper
world
she
glanced
up
the
dark
fissure
as
through
a
flume
the
were
faintly
visible
over
the
cleft
rested
a
moonlit
sky
but
to
the
rocks
clung
the
figure
of
a
man
that
man
stood
there
a
moment
only
then
shouting
a
few
words
as
if
calling
to
somebody
within
he
disappeared
the
song
was
hushed
say
recognized
the
speaker
it
was
tyope
shotaye
former
husband
and
the
one
whom
the
woman
suspected
of
having
done
her
harm
resolutely
she
went
at
her
task
taking
a
bundle
of
owl
feathers
from
her
wrap
she
presented
it
successively
to
the
six
regions
and
then
buried
it
carefully
in
the
sand
below
where
the
first
traversed
the
fissure
again
she
listened
and
spied
and
creeping
forward
concealed
the
second
bunch
in
another
place
near
by
then
she
whispered
the
sinister
prayer
which
was
to
give
to
the
feathers
the
power
to
do
harm
at
the
close
the
drum
rumbled
again
within
the
cliffs
above
her
and
the
chant
rose
strong
and
rude
covering
her
head
shaking
and
shivering
with
sudden
fear
say
koitza
rushed
from
the
spot
ere
day
broke
she
had
reached
home
again
and
extended
her
weary
frame
by
the
side
of
her
sleeping
children
say
slept
for
the
remainder
of
the
night
a
long
sleep
of
exhaustion
the
next
morning
her
first
task
was
to
bury
the
last
bunch
of
owl
feathers
in
the
kitchen
close
to
the
fireplace
where
it
was
to
protect
her
from
the
inroads
of
enemies
she
felt
weak
but
rather
comfortable
her
only
anxiety
was
now
the
return
of
her
husband
zashue
came
home
at
last
as
ever
but
with
a
lively
appetite
akin
to
hunger
his
wife
received
him
in
a
subdued
manner
bordering
on
obsequiousness
she
was
more
than
ever
bent
on
anticipating
any
desire
on
his
part
all
the
while
afraid
of
detection
every
kind
word
spoken
to
her
caused
remorse
every
joke
pained
her
in
secret
it
recalled
what
she
had
done
to
his
companions
perhaps
to
him
also
the
incantations
of
the
chayani
and
the
fasts
of
the
koshare
seemed
to
have
no
effect
whatever
upon
the
course
of
the
the
heavens
clouded
regularly
every
day
they
shed
their
moisture
all
around
the
tyuonyi
but
not
a
drop
fell
in
the
now
the
three
chief
penitents
of
the
tribe
the
hotshanyi
the
shaykatze
and
the
uishtyaka
were
called
upon
to
use
their
means
of
intercession
with
those
above
they
fasted
prayed
and
made
sacrifices
alternately
for
an
entire
moon
still
it
rained
not
in
new
mexico
local
droughts
are
sometimes
very
pertinacious
plants
withered
the
corn
and
beans
suffered
languished
and
died
the
tribe
looked
forward
to
a
winter
without
vegetable
food
but
say
koitza
was
secretly
glad
for
drought
killed
her
disease
she
felt
stronger
every
day
and
worked
zealously
anxious
to
please
her
husband
and
to
remove
every
suspicion
shotaye
called
on
her
frequently
she
too
felt
proud
of
the
success
of
her
cure
sure
of
the
revenge
she
had
taken
upon
her
enemies
when
a
few
rains
swept
at
last
down
upon
the
vale
it
was
too
late
for
the
crops
only
the
few
stores
kept
in
reserve
and
the
proceeds
of
the
hunt
could
save
the
tribe
from
a
famine
women
and
children
put
on
red
wristbands
to
comfort
their
hearts
in
the
prospective
distress
for
a
winter
without
vegetable
supplies
was
until
then
an
unknown
disaster
say
koitza
also
placed
strips
of
red
buckskin
around
her
arms
ostensibly
she
mourned
for
her
tribe
in
reality
it
was
to
relieve
her
heart
from
the
reproaches
of
her
own
conscience
but
when
winter
set
in
and
the
fever
had
not
put
in
its
appearance
her
mind
gradually
changed
she
lost
all
fear
of
discovery
and
finally
felt
proud
of
what
she
had
done
had
she
not
preserved
herself
for
her
own
husband
for
her
children
instead
of
performing
a
crime
it
was
a
meritorious
act
shotaye
encouraged
her
in
such
thoughts
to
her
it
was
less
the
recovery
of
her
friend
than
the
blow
dealt
the
koshare
particularly
her
former
husband
that
excited
her
satisfaction
and
tickled
her
pride
say
thus
felt
happy
and
at
rest
but
that
fatal
interview
with
her
father
suddenly
dispelled
all
her
fond
dreams
the
old
man
revelations
annihilated
everything
at
one
fell
blow
no
hope
was
left
her
life
was
gone
her
doom
sealed
as
if
lightning
had
struck
her
she
lay
down
by
the
hearth
motionless
for
a
long
while
she
heard
nothing
she
stared
vacantly
her
thoughts
came
and
went
like
nebulous
phantoms
at
last
somebody
entered
the
outer
room
but
the
woman
noticed
him
not
three
times
the
called
her
name
she
gave
no
reply
at
the
fourth
call
koitza
she
started
at
last
and
faintly
answered
opona
zashue
her
husband
entered
the
kitchen
and
inquired
are
you
ill
she
raised
herself
hastily
and
replied
no
but
i
was
asleep
the
sun
is
resting
on
the
western
mountains
said
zashue
give
me
something
to
eat
i
am
tired
she
stirred
the
fire
and
when
dry
brush
flamed
over
the
hearth
she
placed
the
on
it
the
remainder
of
the
cornmeal
she
stirred
with
water
and
began
to
mix
cakes
in
the
usual
way
her
husband
watched
her
pleasantly
zashue
was
indeed
a
indian
lithe
and
of
a
fair
height
with
black
hair
and
large
bright
eyes
he
appeared
the
picture
of
vigour
and
mirth
he
chatted
with
the
utmost
nonchalance
telling
his
wife
about
the
insignificant
happenings
of
the
day
the
prospects
of
the
crops
what
such
and
such
a
one
had
said
to
him
and
what
he
had
told
the
other
in
return
it
was
innocent
gossip
intimate
chat
such
as
a
contented
husband
may
tell
a
wife
in
whom
he
places
entire
confidence
how
happy
she
felt
at
the
harmless
chatter
and
yet
how
intensely
miserable
his
inquiry
are
you
ill
rang
in
her
ears
with
a
sickening
clang
like
some
overwhelming
reproach
why
oh
why
had
she
not
spoken
to
him
in
time
he
was
so
good
to
her
now
it
was
too
late
and
beside
why
anticipate
the
fatal
hour
when
he
must
know
all
why
not
improve
the
few
moments
of
respite
granted
ere
death
came
say
koitza
suffered
him
to
continue
and
listened
with
increasing
interest
to
the
talk
of
her
husband
it
might
be
the
last
time
little
by
little
as
he
went
on
with
harmless
sometimes
very
clumsy
jokes
and
jests
she
became
oblivious
of
her
wretched
prospects
and
her
soul
rested
in
the
present
she
began
to
smile
shyly
at
first
then
she
even
laughed
as
zashue
ate
he
praised
her
cooking
and
that
gratified
her
although
it
filled
her
with
remorse
and
anguish
the
children
came
also
and
squatted
around
the
hearth
okoya
alone
keeping
at
a
distance
and
eyeing
his
mother
suspiciously
could
she
in
his
presence
really
feel
as
merry
as
she
acted
was
it
not
evidence
of
the
basest
deception
on
her
part
so
the
boy
reasoned
from
his
own
standpoint
and
went
out
into
the
in
disgust
the
sun
set
and
a
calm
still
night
sank
down
on
the
rito
de
los
frijoles
as
the
sky
darkened
evidences
of
life
and
mirth
began
to
show
themselves
at
the
bottom
of
the
gorge
as
well
as
along
the
cliffs
monotonous
singing
sounded
from
the
roofs
of
the
big
house
from
caves
and
from
slopes
leading
up
to
them
noisy
talking
clear
ringing
laughter
rose
into
the
night
old
as
well
as
young
seemed
to
enjoy
the
balmy
evening
few
remained
indoors
among
these
were
zashue
and
his
wife
the
woman
leaned
against
him
and
often
looked
up
to
his
face
with
a
smile
she
felt
happy
by
the
side
of
her
husband
and
however
harrowing
the
thought
of
her
future
seemed
to
be
the
present
was
blissful
to
her
after
a
while
zashue
rose
and
his
spouse
followed
him
anxiously
to
the
door
trembling
lest
he
should
leave
her
alone
for
the
night
she
grasped
his
hand
and
he
stood
for
a
while
in
the
outer
doorway
gazing
at
the
sky
every
sound
was
hushed
except
the
rushing
of
the
brook
the
canopy
of
heaven
sparkled
in
wonderful
splendour
its
stars
blazed
shedding
peace
upon
earth
and
to
man
the
woman
hand
quivered
in
that
of
her
spouse
he
turned
and
retired
with
her
to
the
interior
of
the
dwelling

chapter
iii
we
must
now
return
to
the
fields
of
the
rito
and
to
the
spot
where
in
the
first
chapter
of
our
story
okoya
had
been
hailed
by
a
man
whom
he
afterward
designated
as
tyope
tihua
that
individual
was
as
we
have
since
found
the
former
husband
of
shotaye
say
friend
after
the
boys
had
left
tyope
had
continued
to
weed
his
corn
not
with
any
pretence
of
activity
or
haste
but
in
the
slow
persistent
way
peculiar
to
the
sedentary
indian
which
makes
of
him
a
steady
though
not
a
very
profitable
worker
tyope
only
implement
was
a
piece
of
basalt
resembling
a
knife
and
he
weeded
on
without
interruption
until
the
shadows
of
the
plants
extended
from
row
to
row
then
he
straightened
himself
and
scanned
quietly
the
whole
valley
as
far
as
visible
like
one
who
is
tired
and
is
taking
a
last
survey
of
the
scene
of
his
daily
toil
the
fields
were
deserted
everybody
had
left
them
except
himself
tyope
pushed
aside
the
stone
implement
and
turned
to
go
after
leaving
the
corn
he
turned
to
the
right
and
gradually
stooping
went
toward
a
grove
of
low
pines
into
that
grove
he
penetrated
slowly
cautiously
avoiding
the
least
noise
it
was
clearly
his
intention
to
conceal
himself
once
inside
of
the
thicket
of
pine
boughs
he
cowered
and
after
listening
again
and
satisfying
himself
that
nobody
was
around
he
plunged
his
right
arm
beneath
the
branches
that
drooped
down
to
the
surface
when
he
withdrew
it
his
hand
grasped
a
bow
he
placed
this
bow
near
his
feet
and
dived
a
second
time
under
the
branches
pulling
out
another
object
which
proved
to
be
a
quiver
made
of
filled
with
arrows
he
examined
each
of
these
arrows
carefully
trying
their
heads
of
flint
and
obsidian
and
replaced
them
in
such
a
manner
that
the
feathered
ends
projected
from
the
quiver
a
third
time
he
ransacked
the
and
produced
from
beneath
the
boughs
a
short
wooden
his
last
essay
brought
to
light
a
cap
of
thick
enough
to
repel
an
arrow
fired
at
short
range
and
so
fashioned
as
to
protect
the
forehead
to
the
eyebrows
while
behind
it
descended
low
upon
the
neck
this
cap
or
helmet
he
forthwith
placed
upon
his
head
then
he
slung
the
quiver
across
his
shoulders
wound
the
thong
of
the
club
around
his
right
wrist
grasped
the
bow
with
the
left
hand
and
rose
to
his
feet
daylight
was
gone
only
a
flat
golden
segment
blazed
above
the
western
peaks
the
peaks
themselves
with
the
mountains
formed
a
huge
mass
of
dark
purple
over
the
valley
night
hovered
already
but
a
streak
of
mist
trailing
here
and
there
like
a
thin
veil
marked
the
course
of
the
little
brook
it
was
so
dark
that
tyope
could
move
without
any
fear
of
being
seen
he
nevertheless
maintained
a
stooping
position
as
long
as
he
was
on
open
ground
once
in
the
corn
he
followed
its
rows
instead
of
traversing
them
as
if
afraid
of
injuring
the
plants
he
also
examined
carefully
the
edge
of
the
brook
before
crossing
it
to
the
south
side
once
on
the
declivity
leading
up
to
the
mesa
he
climbed
nimbly
and
with
greater
unconcern
for
there
the
shadow
was
so
dense
that
nobody
could
notice
him
from
below
from
the
brink
of
the
tyope
looked
back
upon
the
rito
he
stopped
not
so
much
in
order
to
see
for
it
was
too
dark
but
in
order
to
listen
everything
was
quiet
a
bear
snarled
far
away
but
this
did
not
concern
the
listener
he
strolled
on
through
the
scrubby
timber
of
the
mesa
until
he
arrived
at
a
place
where
tall
pines
towered
up
into
the
starry
sky
when
he
stopped
again
and
remained
for
quite
a
while
looking
up
at
the
heavens
the
great
bear
the
seven
stars
as
the
pueblos
term
it
sparkled
near
the
northern
horizon
and
tyope
seemed
to
watch
that
constellation
with
unusual
interest
now
a
hoarse
dismal
yelping
struck
his
ear
the
barking
of
the
coyote
or
prairie
wolf
twice
three
times
the
howl
was
repeated
in
the
distance
then
tyope
replied
to
it
imitating
its
cry
all
was
still
again
suddenly
the
barking
sounded
much
nearer
and
tyope
moved
toward
the
place
whence
the
sound
issued
brushing
past
the
shrubs
reaching
a
clear
space
he
saw
before
him
the
form
of
a
big
wolf
the
animal
was
standing
immovable
his
tail
drooping
his
head
horizontal
are
you
alone
tyope
whispered
the
apparition
or
beast
whatever
it
might
be
seemed
not
to
excite
the
least
apprehension
the
wolf
bent
its
head
in
reply
without
uttering
a
sound
where
are
the
dinne
tyope
continued
a
hollow
chuckle
seemed
to
proceed
from
the
skull
of
the
animal
it
turned
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
but
a
rustling
of
boughs
and
creaking
of
branches
made
known
the
direction
tyope
followed
the
wolf
moved
swiftly
from
time
to
time
its
husky
barkings
were
heard
and
the
indian
from
the
rito
guided
by
these
signals
followed
as
rapidly
as
possible
at
last
he
saw
the
outlines
of
a
against
a
faint
glow
behind
it
sounded
the
crackling
of
freshly
ignited
brushwood
and
soon
a
light
spread
over
the
surrounding
neighbourhood
stepping
into
the
illuminated
circle
tyope
stood
before
a
man
squatting
by
the
fire
the
man
was
heaping
wood
on
the
fire
which
he
had
just
started
by
his
side
lay
the
skin
of
a
large
wolf
he
seemed
not
to
notice
tyope
although
his
face
was
directed
toward
him
for
his
eyes
disappeared
below
projecting
brows
so
projecting
that
only
now
and
then
a
sudden
flash
quick
as
lightning
broke
out
from
beneath
their
shadow
his
form
indicated
strength
and
endurance
he
was
of
stronger
build
than
the
man
from
the
tyuonyi
a
kilt
of
was
his
only
dress
his
hair
was
wound
around
his
skull
like
a
turban
as
ornaments
the
stranger
wore
a
necklace
of
panther
claws
a
bow
and
some
arrows
were
lying
on
the
wolf
skin
beside
him
without
a
word
tyope
squatted
down
near
the
fire
facing
the
other
indian
it
had
turned
cold
and
both
men
held
their
hands
up
to
the
flame
the
former
glanced
at
the
latter
furtively
from
time
to
time
but
neither
uttered
a
word
the
fire
was
beginning
to
decline
its
light
grew
faint
at
last
the
other
indian
said
when
will
the
koshare
go
into
the
round
house
as
soon
as
the
moon
gives
light
tyope
carelessly
replied
how
many
are
there
of
you
why
do
you
want
to
know
this
inquired
the
man
from
the
rito
in
a
husky
voice
his
companion
chuckled
again
and
said
nothing
he
had
put
an
imprudent
question
he
turned
away
carelessly
placed
more
wood
on
the
fire
and
poked
the
embers
tyope
looked
up
at
the
sky
and
thus
the
vivid
scornful
glance
the
other
threw
on
his
figure
escaped
him
so
far
the
conversation
had
been
carried
on
in
the
queres
language
now
the
stranger
suddenly
spoke
in
another
dialect
and
in
a
more
imperious
tone
art
thou
afraid
of
the
dinne
why
should
i
be
afraid
of
them
responded
tyope
in
his
native
tongue
speak
the
tongue
of
the
dinne
the
other
sternly
commanded
and
a
flash
burst
from
beneath
his
eyebrows
almost
as
savage
as
that
of
a
wolf
thou
hast
courted
the
people
of
my
tribe
they
have
not
sought
after
thee
thou
knowest
their
language
speak
it
therefore
and
then
we
shall
see
he
straightened
himself
displaying
a
youthful
figure
full
of
strength
and
elasticity
tyope
took
this
change
of
manner
very
composedly
he
answered
quietly
in
the
same
dialect
if
thou
wilt
nacaytzusle
i
can
speak
like
thy
people
also
it
is
true
i
came
for
them
but
what
i
wanted
he
emphasized
the
word
was
as
much
for
their
benefit
as
my
own
thou
first
of
all
wast
to
gain
by
my
scheme
his
eyes
closed
and
the
glance
became
as
sharp
as
that
of
a
rattlesnake
nacaytzusle
poked
the
embers
with
a
dry
stick
as
if
thinking
over
the
speech
of
the
other
then
he
asked
thou
sayest
thou
hast
wanted
wantest
thou
no
more
not
so
much
as
hitherto
tyope
stated
positively
what
shall
it
be
now
inquired
the
dinne
i
will
speak
to
thee
so
as
to
be
understood
explained
the
man
from
the
rito
but
thou
shalt
tell
thy
people
only
so
much
of
it
as
i
shall
allow
thee
to
say
thou
art
dinne
it
is
true
and
their
tongue
is
thy
language
but
many
a
time
hast
thou
seen
the
sun
set
and
rise
while
the
houses
wherein
we
dwell
on
the
brook
were
thy
home
when
they
brought
thee
to
us
after
the
day
on
which
topanashka
slaughtered
thy
people
beyond
the
mountains
thou
didst
not
remain
with
us
long
the
moon
has
not
been
bright
often
since
thou
left
us
to
join
thy
people
is
it
not
so
nacaytzusle
answer
me
the
navajo
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
is
true
he
said
but
i
have
nothing
in
common
with
the
house
people
it
may
be
so
now
but
if
thou
dost
not
care
for
the
men
the
women
are
not
without
interest
to
thee
is
it
not
thus
the
tzane
on
the
brook
replied
the
navajo
disdainfully
amount
to
nothing
in
that
case
tyope
flared
up
and
grasped
his
club
speaking
in
the
queres
language
and
with
a
vibrating
tone
why
do
you
look
for
a
companion
in
your
own
tribe
mitsha
koitza
does
not
care
for
a
husband
who
sneaks
around
in
the
timber
like
a
wolf
and
whose
only
feat
consists
in
frightening
the
old
women
of
the
tyuonyi
the
navajo
stared
before
him
with
apparent
stolidity
tyope
continued
you
pretend
to
despise
us
now
yet
enough
has
remained
within
your
heart
from
the
time
when
you
lived
at
the
tyuonyi
and
slept
in
the
estufa
of
shyuamo
hanutsh
to
make
my
daughter
appear
in
your
eyes
better
more
handsome
and
more
useful
than
the
girls
of
the
dinne
the
features
of
the
dinne
did
not
move
he
kept
silent
but
his
right
hand
played
with
the
string
of
the
bow
that
lay
on
the
wolf
skin
nacaytzusle
the
other
began
again
i
promised
to
assist
you
to
obtain
the
girl
against
her
will
mind
mitsha
my
daughter
will
never
go
to
a
home
of
the
dinne
of
her
own
accord
but
i
would
have
stolen
her
for
your
sake
now
i
say
to
you
that
i
have
promised
you
this
child
of
mine
and
i
have
promised
your
people
all
the
green
stones
of
my
tribe
the
first
promise
i
shall
fulfil
if
you
wish
the
other
you
may
tell
your
tribe
i
will
not
hold
to
longer
the
navajo
looked
at
him
in
a
strange
doubtful
way
and
replied
you
have
asked
me
to
be
around
the
tyuonyi
day
after
day
night
after
night
to
watch
every
tree
every
shrub
merely
in
order
to
find
out
what
your
former
wife
shotaye
was
doing
and
to
kill
her
if
i
could
you
have
demanded
he
continued
raising
his
voice
while
he
bent
forward
and
darted
at
the
indian
from
the
rito
a
look
of
suppressed
rage
that
the
dinne
should
come
down
upon
the
tyuonyi
at
the
time
when
the
koshare
should
fast
and
pray
and
should
kill
topanashka
the
great
warrior
so
that
you
might
become
maseua
in
his
place
now
i
tell
you
that
i
shall
not
do
either
the
eyes
of
the
young
savage
flamed
like
living
coals
then
you
shall
not
have
my
child
exclaimed
tyope
i
will
get
her
you
may
help
me
or
not
i
dare
you
to
do
it
tyope
hissed
nacaytzusle
looked
straight
at
him
do
you
believe
he
hissed
in
turn
that
if
i
were
to
go
down
to
the
brook
and
tell
the
tapop
what
you
have
urged
me
and
my
people
to
do
against
your
kin
that
he
would
not
reward
me
tyope
tihua
became
very
quiet
his
features
lost
the
threatening
tension
which
they
had
displayed
his
eyes
opened
and
he
said
in
a
softer
tone
that
is
just
what
i
want
you
to
do
but
i
want
this
from
you
alone
go
and
see
the
tapop
tell
him
not
the
small
talk
about
this
and
that
but
what
you
have
seen
with
your
own
eyes
about
shotaye
that
witch
that
snake
of
her
dark
ways
how
she
sneaked
through
the
brush
on
the
mesa
and
how
she
found
and
gathered
the
plumage
of
the
accursed
owl
tell
him
all
and
i
will
carry
mitsha
to
your
lodges
tied
and
gagged
if
needs
be
why
do
you
send
the
girl
out
alone
i
will
wait
for
her
wherever
you
say
do
you
think
that
i
would
be
so
silly
the
pueblo
retorted
with
a
scornful
laugh
do
you
really
believe
i
would
do
such
a
thing
no
dinne
you
and
your
people
may
be
much
more
cunning
than
mine
in
many
ways
but
we
are
not
so
stupid
as
that
if
i
were
to
do
that
you
would
rob
me
of
my
handsome
maiden
and
that
would
be
the
last
of
it
no
dinne
i
do
not
need
you
to
such
an
extent
i
am
not
obliged
to
have
you
but
if
you
go
to
the
tyuonyi
and
accuse
the
witch
then
you
shall
go
out
free
and
mitsha
must
follow
you
to
the
hogans
of
your
people
whether
she
will
or
not
do
what
i
tell
you
and
i
will
do
as
i
promise
if
you
will
not
neither
will
i
for
mind
i
do
not
need
you
any
longer
tyope
glanced
at
the
stars
with
an
air
of
the
utmost
indifference
nacaytzusle
had
listened
quietly
now
he
said
without
raising
his
eyes
tyope
you
ask
me
to
do
all
this
and
do
not
even
give
me
a
pledge
you
are
wise
tyope
much
wiser
than
we
people
of
the
hogans
give
me
some
token
that
you
also
will
do
what
you
have
said
when
i
have
performed
my
part
give
me
he
pointed
to
the
alabaster
tablet
hanging
on
necklace
that
okpanyi
on
your
neck
it
was
so
dark
that
nacaytzusle
in
extending
his
arm
involuntarily
touched
the
other
chest
tyope
drew
back
at
the
touch
and
replied
rather
excitedly
no
i
will
not
give
you
any
pledge
nothing
at
all
asked
the
navajo
a
slight
rustling
noise
was
heard
at
the
same
time
nothing
tyope
exclaimed
hoarsely
the
savage
thrust
his
arm
out
at
the
pueblo
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
a
dull
thud
followed
his
arm
dropped
and
something
fell
to
the
ground
it
was
an
arrow
whose
head
of
flint
falling
on
the
ashes
caused
the
embers
to
glow
for
an
instant
both
men
sprang
in
opposite
directions
like
snakes
darting
through
the
grass
each
one
concealed
himself
behind
a
bush
the
branches
rustled
and
cracked
for
a
short
space
the
place
around
the
fire
was
vacant
nothing
remained
but
a
dim
streak
of
ruddy
light
tyope
after
repelling
the
assault
upon
him
had
taken
refuge
behind
a
low
when
the
navajo
thrust
a
pointed
arrow
at
his
chest
he
had
numbed
the
arm
of
the
savage
by
a
blow
from
his
club
and
then
both
men
like
true
indians
hurriedly
placed
themselves
under
cover
whence
each
listened
eagerly
to
discover
the
movements
of
his
foe
tyope
could
have
killed
the
navajo
while
close
to
him
for
he
had
the
advantage
in
weapons
but
although
he
really
had
no
further
use
for
the
young
man
he
was
not
so
angry
as
to
take
his
life
still
under
the
circumstances
the
greater
the
caution
displayed
the
better
intimately
acquainted
with
the
character
of
the
dinne
indians
and
that
of
nacaytzusle
in
particular
tyope
had
gone
on
this
errand
well
armed
open
hostility
had
resulted
from
the
interview
it
was
useless
to
make
any
attempt
at
conciliation
speedy
return
to
the
rito
was
the
only
thing
left
this
return
might
become
not
only
difficult
but
dangerous
with
the
young
navajo
concealed
on
the
mesa
tyope
had
known
nacaytzusle
thoroughly
from
childhood
twenty
years
before
the
dinne
had
killed
an
old
woman
from
the
tyuonyi
the
murder
took
place
near
the
gorge
on
the
mesa
north
of
it
whither
she
had
gone
to
collect
the
edible
fruit
of
the
piñon
tree
when
the
corpse
was
discovered
the
scalp
had
been
taken
and
this
rather
than
the
killing
demanded
speedy
revenge
a
number
of
men
of
the
clan
to
which
the
grandmother
belonged
gathered
in
order
to
fast
and
make
the
usual
sacrifices
preliminary
to
the
formation
of
a
war
party
on
the
last
night
of
their
fast
a
delegate
from
the
hishtanyi
chayani
appeared
in
their
midst
and
performed
the
customary
incantations
he
painted
their
bodies
with
the
black
lustrous
powder
of
iron
and
manganese
ore
which
is
believed
to
strike
terror
into
the
hearts
of
enemies
he
selected
their
leader
invested
him
with
the
office
and
blessed
the
to
the
leader
he
gave
a
little
bag
of
buckskin
filled
with
the
powder
of
the
yerba
del
manso
which
still
further
produces
dismay
among
the
foe
that
leader
was
topanashka
tihua
then
in
the
full
vigour
of
manhood
on
the
following
morning
topanashka
left
before
daybreak
with
five
picked
men
in
the
hideous
garb
of
indian
braves
they
penetrated
cautiously
the
mountain
labyrinth
west
of
the
rito
concealing
themselves
during
the
day
and
travelling
at
night
on
the
morning
of
the
fifth
day
they
discovered
a
few
huts
of
the
navajo
whether
or
no
their
inmates
had
participated
in
the
murder
of
the
old
woman
they
did
not
stop
to
inquire
but
pounced
upon
the
people
who
were
still
asleep
the
results
of
the
surprise
were
nine
scalps
and
one
captive
this
captive
was
a
little
boy
and
that
boy
was
nacaytzusle
although
barely
three
years
old
he
was
dragged
to
the
rito
and
had
to
take
part
in
the
solemn
dance
during
which
the
scalps
of
his
parents
were
triumphantly
waved
by
those
who
had
killed
them
afterward
he
was
adopted
into
the
turquoise
clan
for
the
people
of
the
eagle
clan
refused
to
receive
him
the
privilege
of
so
doing
being
theirs
topanashka
disliked
the
appearance
of
the
child
and
his
counsels
weighed
heavily
thus
nacaytzusle
became
an
adopted
son
of
the
queres
but
it
did
not
change
his
nature
his
physique
at
once
indicated
foreign
origin
he
grew
up
to
be
taller
more
than
the
youth
of
the
house
people
and
his
dark
wolfish
look
and
the
angular
cut
of
his
features
betrayed
his
dinne
blood
like
all
the
other
youth
he
received
the
rude
education
which
was
imparted
at
the
estufas
he
showed
considerable
aptitude
for
mastering
songs
and
prayers
after
once
acquiring
the
language
of
his
captors
he
also
watched
the
wizards
as
often
as
opportunity
was
afforded
and
learned
many
a
trick
of
jugglery
tyope
was
struck
by
the
aptitude
for
such
arts
and
practices
it
revealed
natural
tendencies
and
confirmed
tyope
in
the
belief
that
the
navajos
were
born
wizards
that
their
juggleries
and
performances
some
of
which
are
indeed
startling
revealed
the
possession
of
higher
powers
the
pueblos
hold
the
navajos
in
quite
superstitious
respect
tyope
therefore
looked
upon
the
young
fellow
as
one
who
in
course
of
time
might
become
an
invaluable
assistant
he
observed
the
boy
ways
and
became
intimately
acquainted
with
all
his
traits

and
good

nacaytzusle
was
a
successful
hunter
he
was
very
nimble
quick
and
exceedingly
persevering
in
everything
he
undertook
but
he
was
also
a
natural
lounger
and
idler
whenever
he
was
not
busy
with
preparations
for
the
hunt
or
repairing
his
own
scanty
clothing
work
in
the
fields
he
avoided
he
even
showed
marked
contempt
for
the
people
of
the
rito
because
the
men
performed
toil
which
he
regarded
as
degrading
keeping
aloof
from
the
men
society
to
a
certain
extent
he
was
more
attracted
by
the
women
it
was
especially
mitsha
koitza
tyope
daughter
who
attracted
him
and
he
began
to
pay
attentions
to
her
in
a
manner
in
keeping
with
his
wild
temperament
tyope
strange
to
say
was
pleased
to
notice
this
he
would
have
been
happy
to
have
given
his
child
to
the
savage
but
he
had
no
right
to
interfere
in
the
matter
of
marriage
for
this
belonged
to
the
girl
own
clan
to
arrange
the
clan
was
that
of
the
eagle
and
topanashka
was
its
most
influential
member
its
leading
spirit
mitsha
avoided
the
navajo
and
when
nacaytzusle
attempted
to
press
his
suit
the
girl
repelled
his
addresses
in
a
manner
that
showed
her
aversion
to
him
beyond
any
possible
question
had
mitsha
been
less
positive
in
her
behaviour
it
is
quite
likely
that
the
character
of
the
young
captive
might
have
changed
that
he
might
have
softened
little
by
little
entering
into
the
path
traced
by
the
customs
of
sedentary
indians
as
it
was
his
hatred
to
them
increased
and
with
it
the
desire
to
recover
his
independence
by
returning
to
his
kindred
about
a
year
before
then
nacaytzusle
disappeared
from
the
tyuonyi
shortly
afterward
tyope
was
suddenly
accosted
by
him
while
hunting
on
the
mesa
and
a
secret
intercourse
began
which
led
to
the
negotiations
of
which
we
have
just
heard
the
main
purport
these
negotiations
were
now
broken
and
in
a
manner
that
made
a
return
to
the
rito
rather
dangerous
the
very
qualities
which
had
fascinated
tyope
the
wariness
agility
and
persistency
of
the
navajo
his
physical
strength
and
above
all
his
supposed
natural
faculties
for
magic
coupled
with
his
thorough
knowledge
of
the
country
caused
tyope
to
ponder
upon
his
means
of
escape
the
blow
which
he
dealt
the
savage
was
sufficient
to
teach
him
that
a
encounter
would
not
result
favourably
to
him
at
the
same
time
this
slight
injury
could
not
fail
to
exasperate
the
navajo
and
tyope
knew
that
the
savage
would
lie
in
wait
for
him
at
some
point
which
he
had
to
pass
on
his
return
for
the
present
nacaytzusle
was
very
likely
concealed
in
the
vicinity
in
the
same
manner
and
for
the
same
reasons
as
the
pueblo
indian
himself
but
he
was
sure
to
leave
his
and
make
some
movement
toward
preparing
either
an
ambush
or
a
sudden
surprise
tyope
remained
motionless
for
a
while
he
glanced
across
the
space
where
the
fire
had
been
burning
but
every
spark
was
gone
and
it
was
too
dark
to
discern
anything
he
finally
rose
to
his
knees
slowly
and
cautiously
and
turned
his
eyes
in
the
opposite
direction
there
also
was
an
open
space
and
the
dim
starlight
enabled
him
to
discover
that
between
his
station
and
the
nearest
tree
something
similar
to
a
rock
or
ledge
protruded
he
peered
and
listened
then
turned
around
on
his
knees
and
flattening
his
body
on
the
ground
began
to
creep
toward
the
tree
as
soon
as
he
reached
its
foot
he
rose
to
full
height
leaned
against
the
trunk
and
glanced
at
the
stars
they
indicated
that
it
was
past
midnight
and
tyope
felt
uneasy
in
case
he
should
be
delayed
and
reach
the
rito
after
daylight
it
might
excite
suspicions
yet
his
only
safety
lay
in
making
a
wide
circuit
the
dismal
yelping
of
a
prairie
wolf
struck
his
ear
and
to
his
alarm
there
was
at
once
a
reply
near
where
the
interview
had
taken
place
but
slightly
to
the
east
and
more
toward
the
deep
gorge
in
which
the
rio
grande
flows
he
concluded
that
nacaytzusle
had
shifted
his
position
by
placing
himself
on
tyope
supposed
line
of
retreat
but
it
was
also
manifest
that
the
boy
had
not
come
to
the
meeting
alone
that
at
least
one
more
navajo
lurked
in
the
vicinity
at
least
one
perhaps
more
another
wolf
now
howled
in
the
direction
of
the
south
a
fourth
one
was
heard
farther
off
and
both
voices
united
in
a
plaintive
wail
any
one
unacquainted
with
the
remarkable
perfection
with
which
the
navajos
imitate
the
nocturnal
chant
of
the
coyote
would
have
been
deceived
and
have
taken
the
sounds
for
the
voices
of
the
animals
themselves
but
tyope
recognized
them
as
signals
through
which
four
navajo
indians
prowling
around
him
informed
each
other
of
their
positions
and
movements
this
made
his
own
situation
exceedingly
critical
the
only
mitigating
circumstance
was
that
the
four
were
dispersed
and
only
one
of
them
could
as
yet
have
an
idea
of
his
whereabouts
the
indian
from
the
rito
braced
himself
against
the
tree
and
taking
off
his
helmet
laid
it
carefully
beside
him
on
the
ground
then
he
took
off
the
quiver
emptied
it
and
tied
the
strap
to
which
it
was
fastened
around
his
waist
to
this
belt
he
tied
both
the
quiver
and
the
helmet
distributing
them
in
such
a
manner
that
in
the
prevailing
darkness
they
appeared
like
one
of
the
ragged
kilts
of
deerskin
which
formed
the
main
part
of
a
navajo
costume
next
tyope
untied
the
knot
which
held
his
hair
on
the
back
of
the
head
divided
the
long
strands
into
switches
and
began
to
wind
those
around
his
skull
necklace
fetich
and
the
plume
that
adorned
his
sidelock
he
put
in
the
quiver
he
was
now
so
far
transformed
that
any
one
nacaytzusle
excepted
might
have
taken
him
in
the
night
for
a
navajo
warrior
this
metamorphosis
was
performed
rapidly
but
without
anxious
haste
or
confusion
the
howls
had
meanwhile
been
repeated
they
sounded
nearer
than
before
from
the
east
the
south
and
the
southeast
nacaytzusle
alone
to
judge
from
the
signals
which
he
gave
remained
stationary
tyope
abandoning
his
position
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
glided
to
the
nearest
shrub
thence
he
struck
northward
in
the
direction
of
the
rito
he
walked
erect
but
scrupulously
avoided
everything
that
might
create
noise
when
near
the
fireplace
he
stood
still
and
listened
a
wolf
yelped
to
the
right
of
where
the
dinne
of
whom
tyope
was
most
afraid
seemed
to
be
listening
about
two
hundred
steps
from
him
on
the
swelling
of
the
mesa
he
manifestly
expected
the
queres
to
return
the
same
way
he
came
it
was
not
a
sign
of
much
wisdom
but
the
boy
was
young
and
inexperienced
in
the
stratagems
of
indian
warfare
tyope
felt
relieved
suddenly
loud
barking
sounded
directly
in
front
of
him
and
at
no
great
distance
tyope
dropped
on
the
ground
and
began
to
glide
like
a
snake
toward
the
place
whence
this
last
signal
came
he
crouched
behind
a
flat
rock
and
raised
his
eyes
it
was
in
vain
nothing
could
be
seen
in
the
obscurity
he
felt
puzzled
was
this
last
signal
the
voice
of
another
enemy
who
had
hitherto
remained
silent
or
was
it
nacaytzusle
who
had
changed
his
position
at
all
events
it
was
safer
to
rise
and
go
directly
toward
the
spot
rather
than
approach
it
in
a
creeping
posture
he
walked
deliberately
onward
at
the
same
time
calling
out
in
a
low
tone
nacaytzusle
nothing
moved
he
advanced
a
few
steps
and
repeated
nacaytzusle
hast
thou
seen
anything
no
said
a
hollow
voice
near
by
and
a
human
form
arose
as
if
from
beneath
the
surface
the
man
stepped
up
to
tyope
and
to
the
unpeakable
relief
he
looked
stouter
and
shorter
than
nacaytzusle
the
indian
was
unknown
to
him
and
tyope
said
eagerly
the
badger
must
be
hiding
near
where
the
fire
is
we
should
cut
off
his
trail
to
the
north
nacaytzusle
went
too
far
east
there
he
pointed
toward
the
northeast
is
where
he
ought
to
stand
tyope
spoke
the
navajo
language
fluently
thou
art
right
said
the
other
go
thither
and
we
will
be
closer
together
tyope
felt
loath
to
follow
this
advice
for
it
would
have
brought
him
uncomfortably
near
his
most
dangerous
foe
yet
under
the
circumstances
and
to
avoid
all
suspicion
he
accepted
the
suggestion
and
was
about
to
turn
in
the
direction
indicated
when
the
signals
sounded
again
and
simultaneously
from
every
quarter
the
strange
indian
held
him
back
asking
how
is
this
we
are
five
and
four
have
shouted
now
who
art
thou
and
where
dost
thou
come
from
i
came
from
above
tyope
replied
with
affected
composure
they
stood
so
close
together
that
the
navajo
could
notice
some
details
of
tyope
accoutrements
grasping
the
cap
of
buffalo
hide
which
dangled
from
the
belt
of
the
queres
he
inquired
what
dost
thou
carry
here
all
was
lost
for
the
navajos
were
well
acquainted
with
this
garment
peculiar
to
the
war
dress
of
the
pueblos
tyope
saw
that
only
the
most
reckless
act
could
save
him
so
he
dropped
all
his
arrows
which
until
now
he
had
carried
in
his
right
hand
and
thrust
his
club
like
a
into
the
other
face
with
a
yell
of
pain
and
surprise
the
navajo
tumbled
backward
into
a
bush
while
tyope
darted
forward
in
the
direction
of
the
rito
behind
him
sounded
the
hoarse
cries
of
the
wounded
man
loud
yells
answering
they
came
from
four
sides
all
the
pursuers
were
running
at
full
speed
to
the
assistance
of
their
companion
madly
like
a
deer
pursued
by
wolves
tyope
bounded
onward
but
soon
his
speed
slackened
he
believed
that
he
was
safe
and
there
was
no
use
in
tiring
himself
his
movements
were
no
longer
noiseless
as
before
during
his
first
run
he
had
made
so
much
noise
as
to
lead
the
pursuers
directly
on
his
trail
these
pursuers
had
suddenly
become
silent
nevertheless
from
time
to
time
rustling
sounds
struck
the
ear
of
tyope
and
proved
that
the
pursuit
was
carried
on
unrelentingly
he
noticed
a
suspicious
twittering
and
cracking
not
behind
him
but
at
one
side
and
it
approached
he
comprehended
at
once
that
one
of
the
navajos
instead
of
rushing
to
the
rescue
of
the
one
whom
tyope
had
struck
down
had
taken
a
direction
diagonal
to
his
own
with
the
hope
of
intercepting
him
near
the
brink
of
the
declivity
leading
down
into
the
rito
or
perhaps
sooner
a
change
in
his
line
of
flight
was
thereby
rendered
necessary
but
in
what
direction
the
warning
sounds
were
heard
directly
north
of
him
then
everything
became
quiet
the
same
stillness
reigned
all
around
and
this
proved
that
the
pursuers
while
certainly
approaching
with
the
greatest
possible
alacrity
were
anxious
to
cover
their
movements
tyope
stood
still
undecided
what
to
do
the
sound
of
a
breaking
or
bending
twig
faint
though
audible
caused
him
to
crouch
behind
a
cedar
bush
again
he
held
his
breath
listened
and
peered
through
the
branches
soon
a
man
appeared
a
navajo
but
whether
it
was
nacaytzusle
or
not
he
could
not
discover
the
indian
glided
across
the
open
space
as
noiselessly
as
a
spectre
and
disappeared
in
a
northerly
direction
tyope
remained
in
his
concealment
for
a
while
and
as
nothing
more
was
heard
or
seen
he
crawled
to
the
nearest
shrub
to
the
west
there
he
again
listened
and
watched
then
rose
to
his
feet
and
moved
in
a
westerly
direction
the
moon
had
risen
and
its
crescent
shed
a
glimmer
over
the
for
some
time
tyope
walked
on
frequently
he
halted
to
listen
everything
was
still
from
this
he
inferred
that
his
enemies
had
passed
him
and
were
now
stationed
along
the
brink
of
the
gorge
in
order
to
intercept
him
and
that
he
had
gone
far
enough
to
risk
a
descent
from
where
he
stood
it
did
not
seem
likely
that
the
navajos
had
posted
themselves
so
far
up
the
brink
since
he
knew
it
to
be
beyond
the
highest
turning
to
the
north
therefore
he
soon
found
himself
under
the
last
trees
of
the
mesa
beyond
opened
a
whitish
chasm
and
the
northern
cliffs
of
the
rito
rose
like
dim
gigantic
phantoms
here
he
knew
the
descent
had
to
be
made
but
here
also
the
most
imminent
danger
was
lurking
the
brink
of
the
rito
on
the
south
side
is
lined
by
shrubbery
with
high
timber
interspersed
but
ledges
of
friable
volcanic
rocks
advance
in
places
beyond
this
shade
crowning
the
heights
like
irregular
battlements
their
surface
is
bare
and
anything
moving
on
them
might
become
visible
to
a
watchful
eye
notwithstanding
the
dimness
of
the
moonlight
tyope
lay
down
and
began
to
glide
like
a
snake
he
moved
slowly
pushing
his
body
into
every
depression
hugging
closely
every
protuberance
thus
he
succeeded
in
crossing
the
open
space
between
the
woods
and
the
rim
of
the
declivity
now
he
could
overlook
the
valley
beneath
and
glance
down
the
slope
it
was
not
very
steep
and
thickets
covered
it
in
places
but
between
him
and
the
nearest
brush
a
bare
ledge
had
yet
to
be
crossed
he
crept
into
a
wide
fissure
and
then
down
the
crags
were
not
high
scarcely
ten
feet
then
he
pushed
cautiously
on
to
the
open
space
when
near
the
middle
of
it
he
raised
his
head
to
look
around
immediately
a
twang
sounded
from
the
heights
above
him
and
a
whiz
followed
tyope
bounded
to
his
feet
reeled
for
a
moment
another
twang
and
another
whizzing
an
arrow
struck
the
ground
where
he
had
lain
but
already
the
queres
was
away
leaping
from
rock
to
rock
tearing
through
shrubbery
and
thickets
like
a
frightened
mountain
sheep
stones
rolled
from
above
somebody
was
hastening
down
in
pursuit
arrow
upon
arrow
sped
after
the
fugitive
but
tyope
was
safely
out
of
reach
and
in
the
bottom
whither
the
navajo
did
not
dare
to
follow
a
drizzling
noise
like
that
of
pebbles
dropping
from
a
height
told
that
the
pursuer
had
withdrawn
to
the
woods
again
then
all
was
still
down
below
on
the
edge
of
the
brook
lay
tyope
panting
from
exhaustion
his
life
was
safe
and
he
felt
unhurt
but
he
was
overcome
by
emotion
and
effort
as
long
as
the
excitement
had
lasted
his
physical
strength
had
held
out
now
that
all
was
over
he
felt
tired
and
weak
yet
he
could
not
think
of
rest
for
daybreak
was
close
at
hand
he
dipped
some
water
from
the
brook
and
moistened
his
parched
lips
taking
care
not
to
touch
his
face
or
body
with
the
liquid
tyope
was
tired
and
worn
out
but
at
the
same
time
angry
and
when
the
indian
suffers
or
when
he
is
angry
he
neither
washes
nor
bathes
physical
or
mental
pain
disappointment
and
wrath
are
with
him
compatible
only
with
lack
of
cleanliness
and
since
he
becomes
wrathful
or
disappointed
or
sick
quite
as
often
as
we
do
his
bodily
condition
is
frequently
far
from
pleasant
tyope
felt
angry
and
disappointed
at
himself
the
failure
in
regard
to
nacaytzusle
was
not
the
cause
of
his
disappointment
what
angered
him
was
that
he
had
not
killed
the
navajo
whom
he
struck
down
on
the
mesa
and
taken
his
scalp
there
would
have
been
ample
time
and
he
could
have
concealed
the
trophy
returning
for
it
in
the
daytime
he
had
already
taken
one
scalp
in
his
life
but
to
have
missed
this
opportunity
of
securing
a
second
one
was
an
unpardonable
failure
it
was
this
which
caused
him
to
avoid
the
cooling
waters
and
forget
the
demands
of
cleanliness
he
rose
and
walked
on
the
valley
opened
before
him
the
dim
light
of
a
waning
moon
shone
into
it
allowing
a
practised
eye
to
discern
grotto
after
grotto
in
the
cliffs
as
tyope
proceeded
down
the
gorge
following
the
brook
course
he
glanced
at
the
caves
they
were
those
of
the
water
clan
he
frowned
and
clenched
his
fist
in
anger
there
lived
his
enemy
shotaye
his
former
spouse
there
was
her
den
the
abode
of
the
hated
witch
how
often
had
she
crossed
his
path
how
often
warned
those
whom
he
had
planned
to
injure
yes
she
was
a
sorceress
for
she
knew
too
much
about
his
ways
but
now
his
time
would
come
for
he
too
knew
something
concerning
her
that
must
ruin
her
forever
he
had
known
it
for
some
time
but
only
now
was
it
possible
to
accuse
her
he
shook
his
fist
at
the
cliffs
in
silent
rage
the
thought
of
taking
revenge
filled
his
heart
with
sinister
joy
and
made
him
forget
the
fatigue
and
disappointment
of
the
past
hours
he
soon
stood
in
front
of
the
place
where
the
cliffs
form
a
perpendicular
wall
and
where
instead
of
excavating
dwellings
the
people
of
the
eagle
clan
had
built
their
quarters
outside
using
the
smooth
surface
of
the
rock
as
a
rear
wall
a
row
of
terraced
houses
some
three
some
two
stories
high
others
with
a
only
extended
along
the
base
of
the
rocks
looking
like
a
shapeless
ruin
in
the
faint
glow
of
the
moon
toward
this
edifice
tyope
walked
all
was
silent
for
nobody
had
as
yet
risen
from
sleep
he
climbed
on
the
roof
of
a
house
and
stooped
over
the
hatchway
to
listen
it
was
dark
inside
and
only
the
sound
of
regular
breathings
could
be
heard
tyope
descended
into
the
room
two
persons
lay
on
the
floor
fast
asleep
they
were
his
wife
and
daughter
concealing
his
weapons
and
he
stretched
himself
at
full
length
beside
the
others
the
rushing
of
the
brook
was
but
faintly
heard
a
cold
blast
entered
through
the
loophole
in
the
wall
tyope
heaved
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
and
closed
his
weary
eyes
the
night
was
nearly
over
but
he
had
reached
home
before
the
dawn
of
day

chapter
iv
a
bright
morning
followed
the
night
on
which
tyope
underwent
his
adventures
he
slept
long
but
it
attracted
no
undue
attention
and
called
forth
no
remarks
on
the
part
of
his
wife
and
daughter
they
were
wont
to
see
him
come
and
go
at
any
hour
of
the
night
it
was
very
near
noon
when
he
awoke
at
last
and
after
disposing
of
his
late
breakfast
la
mode
du
sauntered
off
to
parts
unknown
to
the
others
the
day
was
one
of
remarkable
beauty
no
dim
foggy
city
sun
cast
a
sullen
glance
at
the
landscape
the
sun
stood
in
the
zenith
of
a
sky
of
the
deepest
azure
like
a
flaming
sparkling
dazzling
meteor
still
its
heat
was
not
oppressive
on
the
mesa
above
the
rito
a
fresh
wind
was
blowing
the
shrubbery
was
gently
moved
by
the
breeze
a
faint
rushing
sound
was
heard
like
distant
waves
surging
back
and
forth
in
the
gorge
a
zephyr
only
fanned
the
tops
of
the
tallest
pines
a
quietness
reigned
a
stillness
like
that
which
the
poets
of
old
ascribe
to
the
elysian
fields
there
is
not
much
bustle
about
the
big
house
on
the
tyuonyi
the
men
are
out
and
at
work
and
the
children
have
retired
to
the
a
group
of
girls
alone
enlivens
the
space
between
the
main
building
and
the
new
home
of
the
corn
people
they
are
gathered
in
a
throng
while
they
talk
laugh
and
chatter
pointing
at
the
fresh
coat
of
clay
which
they
have
finished
applying
to
the
outside
of
the
new
building
their
hands
are
yet
filled
with
the
liquid
material
used
for
plastering
and
they
taunt
each
other
as
to
the
relative
merits
of
their
work
one
of
the
maidens
a
plump
little
thing
with
a
pair
of
lively
eyes
calls
out
to
another
pointing
at
a
spot
where
the
plaster
appears
less
smooth
and
even
see
there
aistshie
you
did
that
you
were
too
lazy
to
go
over
it
again
look
at
my
work
how
even
it
is
compared
with
yours
the
other
girl
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
retorted
it
may
be
but
it
is
not
my
fault
it
is
yours
sayap
you
did
it
yesterday
when
we
beat
off
the
boys
you
pushed
shyuote
against
the
wall
and
he
thumped
his
head
here
see
this
is
the
mark
where
he
struck
the
clay
you
did
this
sayap
not
i
sayap
laughed
and
her
buxom
form
shook
you
are
right
i
did
it
i
served
the
urchin
right
it
was
good
was
it
not
aistshie
how
i
punished
the
brat
and
how
he
looked
afterward
with
his
face
all
one
yes
aistshie
objected
but
i
did
more
i
faced
okoya
despite
his
bow
and
arrows
that
was
more
than
you
did
the
other
girls
interrupted
the
scornful
reply
which
sayap
was
on
the
point
of
giving
they
crowded
around
the
two
with
a
number
of
eager
questions
what
was
it
queried
one
what
happened
yesterday
another
did
you
have
a
quarrel
with
boys
a
third
and
so
on
all
pressed
around
begging
and
coaxing
them
to
tell
the
story
of
adventure
the
heroines
themselves
looked
at
each
other
in
embarrassment
at
last
aistshie
broke
out
you
tell
it
sayap
well
began
the
latter
it
was
yesterday
afternoon
and
we
were
just
putting
on
the
last
touches
of
the
coating
when
okoya
and
little
shyuote
his
brother
a
clod
skilfully
hurled
struck
her
right
ear
filling
it
with
sand
and
cutting
off
the
thread
of
her
narrative
rather
abruptly
sayap
wheeled
around
to
see
whence
the
blow
had
come
the
other
girls
all
laughed
but
she
was
angry
her
wrath
was
raised
to
the
highest
pitch
however
when
she
discovered
that
shyuote
was
the
aggressor
on
a
little
eminence
near
by
stood
the
scamp
dancing
cutting
capers
and
yelling
triumphantly
shyuote
is
small
but
he
knows
how
to
throw
fiend
cried
sayap
in
reply
she
picked
up
a
stone
raised
it
in
the
awkward
manner
in
which
most
girls
handle
missiles
and
running
toward
the
boy
hurled
it
at
him
it
fell
far
short
of
its
mark
of
course
and
shyuote
only
laughed
danced
and
grimaced
so
much
the
more
as
sayap
kept
advancing
and
the
other
girls
followed
he
threw
a
second
clod
which
struck
her
squarely
in
the
face
and
so
sharply
that
blood
flowed
from
her
nose
and
mouth
at
the
same
time
the
rogue
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
come
on
all
of
you
i
am
not
afraid
you
will
never
catch
me
and
as
the
majority
of
his
pursuers
came
on
while
two
or
three
remained
behind
soothing
and
consoling
sayap
who
stood
still
crying
and
bleeding
he
thrust
out
his
tongue
at
them
its
full
length
performed
a
number
of
odious
grimaces
and
then
nimbly
clambered
up
between
a
group
of
erosive
cones
that
lay
in
front
of
the
cliff
he
turned
around
once
more
to
yell
defiance
and
scorn
at
his
pursuers
and
disappeared
on
the
other
side
farther
pursuit
being
hopeless
the
girls
clustered
around
the
weeping
sayap
and
held
a
council
of
war
they
vowed
dire
vengeance
on
the
lad
and
promised
their
injured
sister
to
improve
the
first
opportunity
that
should
present
itself
shyuote
on
the
other
hand
felt
proud
of
his
success
his
revenge
was
he
felt
a
glorious
one
still
he
was
careful
not
to
forget
the
counsels
of
prudence
and
instead
of
returning
to
the
house
by
a
direct
route
which
might
have
carried
him
too
near
the
enraged
damsels
he
sauntered
along
hugging
the
cliffs
for
some
distance
and
then
cautiously
sneaked
into
the
fields
below
the
new
homes
of
the
maize
clan
once
in
the
corn
he
felt
safe
and
was
about
to
cross
the
brook
to
the
south
side
when
the
willows
bordering
the
streamlet
rustled
and
tossed
and
a
voice
called
to
him
from
the
thicket
where
are
you
going
uak
shyuote
stopped
and
looked
around
for
the
speaker
but
nobody
was
visible
again
the
boughs
rustled
and
shook
and
there
emerged
from
the
willows
an
old
man
of
low
stature
with
hair
and
shrivelled
features
he
wore
no
ornaments
at
all
his
wrap
was
without
belt
and
very
dirty
in
his
left
hand
he
held
a
plant
which
he
had
pulled
up
by
the
roots
he
stepped
up
to
shyuote
stood
close
by
his
side
and
growled
at
him
rather
than
spoke
i
asked
you
where
you
were
going
why
do
you
answer
shyuote
was
frightened
and
stammered
in
reply
to
see
my
father
who
is
your
father
zashue
tihua
the
features
of
the
interlocutor
took
on
a
singular
expression
it
was
not
one
of
pleasure
neither
did
it
betoken
anger
if
anything
it
denoted
a
sort
of
grim
satisfaction
if
zashue
is
your
father
continued
he
and
his
eyes
twinkled
strangely
say
koitza
must
be
your
mother
of
course
retorted
the
boy
to
whom
this
interrogatory
seemed
ludicrous
and
okoya
your
brother
the
old
man
persisted
why
do
you
ask
all
this
inquired
the
child
laughingly
a
look
piercing
and
venomous
darted
from
the
eyes
of
the
questioning
man
he
snarled
angrily
because
i
ask
it
i
ask
and
you
shall
answer
me
without
inquiring
why
and
wherefore
do
you
hear
uak
shyuote
hung
his
head
he
felt
afraid
i
forbid
you
to
say
anything
about
what
i
say
to
you
to
your
mother
continued
the
other
grasping
the
left
arm
of
the
boy
shyuote
shook
off
the
grip
and
also
shook
his
head
in
token
of
refusal
the
old
man
seized
the
arm
again
and
clutched
it
so
firmly
with
his
bony
fingers
that
the
lad
screamed
from
pain
let
me
go
he
cried
you
hurt
me
let
me
go
will
you
do
as
i
bid
you
asked
his
tormentor
yes
sobbed
the
child
i
will
obey
my
mother
shall
not
know
anything
let
me
go
you
hurt
the
man
loosened
his
grip
slightly
to
your
father
you
shall
say
that
i
the
koshare
naua
the
boy
looked
up
at
him
at
these
words
in
astonishment
send
word
to
him
through
you
to
come
to
my
house
on
the
night
after
the
one
that
will
follow
this
day
when
the
new
moon
sets
behind
the
mountains
do
you
hear
me
boy
shyuote
stared
at
the
interlocutor
with
mouth
wide
open
and
with
an
expression
of
fear
and
surprise
that
evidently
amused
the
other
he
gave
him
a
last
look
a
sharp
threatening
penetrating
glance
then
his
features
became
less
stern
have
no
fear
he
said
in
a
milder
tone
i
will
not
do
you
any
harm
but
you
must
do
as
i
say
go
to
your
nashtio
now
and
tell
him
what
i
said
with
this
he
wheeled
about
and
left
the
boy
as
abruptly
as
he
had
appeared
shyuote
stood
gaping
and
perplexed
he
felt
very
much
like
crying
his
arm
still
ached
from
the
grip
of
the
old
man
and
while
he
was
rubbing
the
sore
spot
his
anger
rose
at
the
harsh
and
cruel
treatment
he
had
suffered
he
thought
of
rushing
home
to
his
mother
forthwith
and
telling
her
all
about
the
bad
old
man
and
how
he
had
forbidden
him
to
say
anything
to
her
still
the
koshare
naua
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
and
shyuote
young
and
childish
as
he
was
had
some
misgivings
about
betraying
his
confidence
his
father
had
told
him
that
the
naua
or
chief
leader
of
the
koshare
was
a
very
wise
and
therefore
a
very
powerful
man
zashue
who
as
soon
as
shyuote
was
born
had
pledged
the
child
to
become
one
of
the
delight
makers
was
educating
the
lad
gradually
in
his
duties
and
shyuote
had
already
imbibed
enough
of
that
discipline
to
feel
a
tremendous
respect
for
the
leader
of
the
society
to
which
he
was
pledged
to
belong
he
suppressed
the
thoughts
of
rebellion
that
had
arisen
and
strolled
on
crossing
the
creek
and
hunting
for
his
father
among
the
on
the
other
side
but
his
had
left
him
instead
of
being
triumphantly
buoyant
he
felt
morose
and
humiliated
zashue
tihua
was
at
work
in
the
fields
of
the
water
clan
on
the
southern
border
of
the
cultivated
plots
he
was
not
alone
another
young
man
kept
him
company
it
was
his
younger
brother
hayoue
they
were
weeding
side
by
side
and
exchanging
remarks
while
the
work
went
on
zashue
looked
up
and
his
handsome
face
brightened
when
he
discovered
shyuote
coming
toward
them
through
the
maize
a
visit
from
his
favourite
child
although
by
no
means
an
unusual
occurrence
was
always
a
source
of
pleasure
he
liked
to
have
shyuote
around
him
when
he
was
at
work
throwing
a
small
sharp
toward
the
boy
he
called
out
to
him
come
take
this
okpanyi
and
begin
weeding
where
you
stand
weed
toward
us
until
we
meet
and
we
will
go
home
together
to
the
yaya
this
was
still
further
a
source
of
displeasure
to
shyuote
who
above
all
things
disliked
work
he
had
not
come
down
to
the
fields
to
toil
what
he
sought
for
was
a
friendly
chat
with
his
father
a
few
hours
of
lounging
and
loafing
near
him
disappointed
and
pouting
he
bent
over
the
work
assigned
while
the
two
men
went
on
with
their
task
as
well
as
with
their
conversation
hayoue
was
taller
than
his
brother
and
a
strikingly
handsome
young
indian
his
eyes
had
a
more
serious
and
less
mischievous
expression
than
those
of
zashue
he
was
yet
unmarried
but
notwithstanding
a
marked
predilection
for
the
fair
sex
formed
one
of
his
characteristics
he
was
held
in
high
esteem
by
the
leading
men
of
the
tribe
tyope
and
his
adherents
excepted
for
his
sagacity
good
judgment
and
personal
valour
i
tell
you
zashue
spoke
up
shyuote
will
become
a
good
one
hayoue
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
replied
you
should
know
your
own
children
better
than
i
yet
i
tell
you
okoya
also
is
good
besides
he
is
wise
and
reserved
yes
but
he
is
too
much
with
the
women
and
his
mother
stands
nearer
to
him
than
his
father
he
never
follows
me
to
the
fields
unless
i
tell
him
look
at
the
little
one
on
the
other
hand
he
will
be
a
man
while
his
brother
spoke
hayoue
had
quietly
observed
shyuote
and
the
slow
loitering
way
in
which
the
boy
performed
his
work
had
not
escaped
his
observation
he
said
it
may
be
he
certainly
acts
rather
like
an
old
woman
see
how
loath
he
is
to
weed
the
plants
you
always
prefer
okoya
replied
zashue
you
like
him
because
he
never
opens
his
mouth
unless
an
arrow
is
forced
between
his
teeth
and
you
prefer
shyuote
because
you
are
making
a
koshare
of
him
hayoue
answered
with
great
composure
he
surely
will
become
a
good
one
a
better
one
than
i
am
if
he
becomes
as
good
a
delight
maker
as
you
are
zashue
we
may
be
satisfied
shall
you
soon
retire
to
the
estufa
he
inquired
changing
the
subject
of
the
conversation
i
do
know
the
naua
has
not
said
anything
as
yet
but
the
time
is
near
at
hand
when
we
should
begin
to
work
before
going
into
the
round
house
in
the
rocks
we
ought
to
be
sure
that
there
are
no
navajos
in
the
neighbourhood
you
are
kauanyi
a
member
of
the
order
of
warriors
he
added
with
a
at
his
brother
do
you
know
anything
of
the
sneaking
wolves
in
the
mountains
hayoue
denied
any
knowledge
concerning
the
navajos
adding
i
did
not
like
it
when
that
fellow
nacaytzusle
ran
away
from
us
he
knew
too
much
of
our
ways
he
can
do
no
harm
he
is
glad
to
stay
among
his
people
still
i
do
trust
him
hayoue
muttered
neither
would
i
if
i
were
in
your
place
zashue
taunted
and
a
though
mischievous
smile
lit
up
his
features
if
i
were
you
i
would
keep
still
better
guard
over
mitsha
koitza
what
have
i
to
do
with
the
child
of
tyope
exclaimed
the
other
rather
contemptuously
indeed
queried
zashue
so
you
too
are
against
tyope
what
has
he
done
to
you
nothing
but
i
mistrust
him
as
much
as
i
do
the
navajo
these
last
words
were
uttered
in
such
a
positive
manner
they
were
so
earnestly
emphasized
that
they
cut
off
the
conversation
it
was
plain
that
hayoue
had
made
up
his
mind
on
the
subject
and
that
he
did
not
wish
to
have
it
broached
again
sa
nashtio
called
shyuote
over
to
where
the
brothers
were
weeding
in
silence
come
over
here
i
must
tell
you
something
but
i
must
tell
it
to
you
alone
hayoue
at
once
turned
away
while
zashue
called
the
lad
to
him
but
shyuote
protested
saying
that
only
his
father
was
to
hear
his
communication
and
zashue
at
last
went
where
the
boy
was
standing
it
vexed
him
and
he
inquired
rather
gruffly
what
he
had
to
say
shyuote
made
a
very
wise
and
important
face
placed
a
finger
to
his
lips
and
whispered
the
koshare
naua
told
me
to
tell
you
that
you
should
go
to
see
him
not
but
the
day
after
when
the
moon
goes
behind
the
mountains
is
that
all
exclaimed
zashue
disappointed
and
angry
is
that
all
you
had
to
say
that
much
you
might
have
shouted
to
me
there
was
no
need
of
being
so
secret
about
it
and
he
glanced
at
the
insignificant
and
careless
work
the
boy
had
performed
is
that
all
you
have
done
since
you
came
you
are
lazy
uak
go
home
go
home
at
once
to
your
mother
and
tell
her
that
i
shall
not
return
for
the
evening
but
will
stay
with
hayoue
in
the
caves
and
as
shyuote
dismayed
and
troubled
appeared
loath
to
go
zashue
turned
to
him
again
commanding
in
a
very
angry
tone
go
home
go
home
at
once

he
felt
very
much
like

did
i

you
that
shyuote

let

growled
zashue
and
both
went
on
with
the
work
as
before
shyuote
stumbled
across
the
patches
of
corn
rather
than
walked
through
them
he
felt
sad
dejected
and
very
wrathful
all
the
buoyancy
with
which
his
victory
over
the
girls
had
inspired
him
was
gone
since
that
heroic
feat
nothing
but
had
crossed
his
path
he
was
angry
at
his
father
for
scolding
him
and
driving
him
home
in
the
presence
of
hayoue
for
whom
the
boy
had
as
great
a
dislike
as
his
uncle
had
for
him
why
it
was
worse
than
the
threats
and
cuffs
of
the
old
naua
it
was
not
only
an
injustice
it
was
an
insult
so
the
lad
reasoned
and
began
to
brood
over
vengeance
he
was
going
to
show
his
father
that
he
the
boy
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
yes
he
would
show
his
teeth
by
refusing
to
become
a
koshare
would
not
that
be
a
glorious
revenge
the
little
fellow
did
not
know
that
he
was
pledged
to
the
delight
makers
by
a
sacred
vow
of
his
parent
which
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
break
after
a
while
his
thoughts
changed
and
he
concluded
that
it
might
be
better
to
say
nothing
and
to
go
home
and
ask
for
something
to
eat
but
never
never
again
would
he
favour
his
father
with
a
friendly
call
in
the
this
latter
resolve
appeared
to
him
so
satisfactory
the
revenge
so
ample
for
the
injury
received
that
he
forgot
the
past
and
fairly
danced
through
the
fields
hopping
sometimes
on
one
foot
and
sometimes
on
the
other
he
crossed
the
brook
and
reached
the
large
house
almost
to
his
own
surprise
it
was
noon
and
the
full
blaze
of
the
sun
flooded
the
valley
with
light
not
a
breeze
fanned
the
air
nothing
stirred
no
vibrations
troubled
the
picture
which
the
cliffs
the
caves
the
buildings
presented
in
the
dazzling
glare
the
cliffs
had
lost
their
yellowish
hue
and
appeared
white
with
every
protuberance
every
indentation
or
cavity
marked
by
intense
shadows
the
houses
inhabited
by
the
eagle
clan
along
the
foot
of
the
rocks
were
like
a
row
of
irregularly
piled
cubes
and
prisms
each
beam
leaning
against
them
cast
a
streak
of
shadow
on
the
ground
below
the
projecting
beams
of
the
roofs
a
short
black
line
descended
along
the
wall
and
the
towering
rocks
jutted
in
and
out
from
dark
recesses
like
monsters
so
strong
were
the
contrasts
between
shadow
and
light
that
even
shyuote
was
struck
by
it
he
stood
still
and
stared
something
indefinite
a
vague
feeling
of
awe
crept
over
him
for
the
real
grandeur
of
the
scenery
he
had
no
sense
of
appreciation
and
yet
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
everything
about
were
new
and
strange
thousands
of
times
had
he
gazed
at
the
cliffs
of
his
valley
home
but
never
had
they
appeared
to
him
as
they
did
now
so
strong
was
this
impression
and
so
sudden
too
that
he
shrank
from
the
sight
in
amazement
then
he
turned
his
eyes
away
and
walked
rapidly
toward
home
he
was
afraid
to
look
at
the
colossal
pillars
and
walls
they
appeared
to
him
like
giants
threatening
to
move
all
his
plans
for
revenge
every
thought
of
wrath
and
indignation
had
vanished
suddenly
his
left
knee
was
struck
by
a
stone
hurled
with
such
force
that
shyuote
bounded
and
screamed
at
the
same
time
six
or
seven
boys
some
apparently
of
his
age
while
others
were
taller
and
older
rushed
from
the
bushes
skirting
the
ditch
two
of
them
ran
directly
in
front
of
him
they
were
armed
with
sticks
and
short
clubs
and
the
largest
who
seemed
to
be
of
the
same
age
as
okoya
shouted
you
have
injured
sayap
and
caused
her
blood
to
flow
you
rotten
squash
you
shall
suffer
for
it
shyuote
took
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
he
saw
that
only
desperate
running
would
save
him
from
being
roughly
handled
he
darted
off
like
an
arrow
toward
the
in
front
of
him
unfortunately
these
were
the
quarters
of
the
corn
people
who
had
not
yet
moved
into
their
new
homes
to
them
belonged
sayap
and
the
boys
that
were
assailing
shyuote
and
as
the
fugitive
approached
the
slope
he
saw
it
occupied
by
other
youth
ready
and
eager
to
give
him
a
warm
reception
at
the
same
time
the
tallest
of
his
pursuers
was
gaining
on
him
rapidly
rocks
flew
past
his
head
a
stone
struck
him
between
the
ribs
stopping
his
breath
almost
in
despair
he
turned
to
the
left
and
making
a
last
effort
flew
towards
the
houses
of
the
eagle
clan
panting
blinded
by
exertion
and
by
pain
he
reached
one
of
the
beams
leading
to
a
roof
rushed
upward
along
it
and
was
about
to
take
refuge
in
the
room
below
when
a
young
girl
came
up
the
primitive
ladder
down
which
he
had
intended
to
precipitate
himself
issuing
from
the
hatchway
she
quietly
pushed
the
lad
to
one
side
then
as
in
that
moment
one
of
his
pursuers
appeared
on
the
roof
she
stepped
between
him
and
shyuote
get
out
of
the
way
mitsha
let
me
get
at
the
wren
cried
the
youth
who
had
just
climbed
the
roof
shyuote
fled
to
the
very
wall
of
the
rock
he
gave
up
all
hope
and
thought
himself
lost
but
the
girl
quietly
asked
what
do
you
want
with
the
boy
he
has
hurt
sayap
our
sister
the
tall
youngster
answered
he
threw
a
stone
at
her
and
caused
her
to
bleed
now
i
am
going
to
pay
him
for
it
so
will
i
shouted
another
one
from
below
i
too
and
i
he
shall
get
it
from
all
of
us
yelled
a
number
of
youthful
voices
and
in
an
instant
the
roof
was
crowded
with
boys
mitsha
had
placed
herself
so
as
to
shield
the
trembling
lad
with
her
own
body
very
quietly
she
said
do
you
see
that
he
also
is
bleeding
let
him
go
now
it
is
enough
a
stone
had
indeed
grazed
shyuote
scalp
and
blood
was
trickling
down
his
cheek
it
is
not
enough
shouted
one
of
the
older
boys
angrily
get
out
of
the
way
mitsha
you
shall
not
hurt
him
on
this
roof
replied
mitsha
in
a
calm
but
very
positive
tone
do
you
intend
to
protect
him
cried
the
tallest
one
of
the
pursuers
and
another
one
exclaimed
how
does
it
concern
you
you
have
nothing
to
do
here
all
turned
against
the
girl
a
little
fellow
who
carried
several
large
pebbles
in
his
hand
for
the
occasion
endeavoured
to
steal
a
march
around
mitsha
in
order
to
reach
shyuote
but
she
noticed
it
and
grasped
his
arm
and
pulled
him
back
so
vigourously
that
he
reeled
and
fell
at
full
length
on
the
roof
then
she
ordered
them
all
to
leave
forthwith
you
belong
to
the
corn
clan
she
said
and
have
nothing
to
do
here
on
the
houses
of
the
eagle
clan
go
down
get
away
at
once
or
i
will
call
our
men
as
long
as
i
am
here
you
shall
not
touch
the
uak
so
you
take
his
part
cried
the
biggest
one
of
the
invaders
he
raised
a
stick
to
strike
her
lay
down
your
club
you
dirty
ear
of
corn
replied
the
maiden
or
you
will
fare
badly
with
this
she
drew
from
under
her
wrap
a
heavy
it
was
the
same
weapon
which
tyope
had
used
the
night
previous
the
boy
arm
remained
uplifted
but
still
the
attitude
of
the
girl
her
threatening
look
and
resolute
appearance
checked
the
assailants
mitsha
stood
with
apparent
composure
but
her
eyes
sparkled
and
the
expression
of
her
face
denoted
the
utmost
determination
besides
she
was
fully
as
tall
as
most
of
her
opponents
and
the
weapon
she
was
holding
in
readiness
looked
quite
formidable
but
the
superior
number
of
her
assailants
exercised
a
certain
pressure
on
these
assailants
themselves
and
the
indian
under
such
circumstances
has
no
thought
of
chivalrous
feeling
a
dozen
boys
stood
before
the
solitary
maiden
on
the
roof
and
they
were
not
to
be
intimidated
by
her
for
an
instant
only
neither
said
a
word
then
a
threatening
murmur
arose
one
of
the
lads
called
out
to
the
tallest
of
the
crowd
strike
her
down
shohona
a
stone
was
thrown
at
her
but
missed
its
aim
at
this
moment
the
boys
nearest
the
brink
of
the
roof
were
suddenly
thrust
aside
right
and
left
the
one
who
had
threatened
mitsha
with
his
stick
was
pulled
back
and
jerked
to
one
side
violently
and
before
the
astonished
girl
stood
okoya
pale
with
emotion
breathless
with
heaving
chest
and
quivering
from
excitement
he
gasped
to
her
go
down
into
the
room
i
will
protect
my
brother
then
he
turned
to
face
the
assailants
the
scene
on
the
roof
had
attracted
a
large
number
of
spectators
who
had
gathered
below
and
were
exchanging
surmises
and
advice
on
the
merits
of
a
case
about
which
none
of
them
really
knew
anything
now
a
voice
rose
from
amid
this
gaping
and
chattering
crowd
the
sharp
and
screechy
voice
of
an
angry
woman
she
shouted
to
those
who
were
on
the
roof
get
down
from
my
house
get
down
you
scoundrels
if
you
want
to
kill
each
other
do
it
elsewhere
and
not
on
my
home
with
this
the
woman
climbed
on
to
the
roof
she
seized
the
boy
nearest
to
her
by
the
hair
and
pulled
him
fairly
to
the
ground
so
that
the
poor
fellow
howled
from
pain
with
the
other
hand
she
dealt
blows
and
cuffs
and
scratched
and
punched
indiscriminately
among
the
youngsters
so
that
a
sudden
panic
broke
out
among
these
heroes
each
sought
to
get
out
of
her
reach
with
the
greatest
alacrity
she
at
last
released
her
hold
on
the
first
victim
and
reached
out
for
another
but
the
last
of
the
young
corn
people
was
just
tumbling
down
from
the
roof
and
her
clutch
at
his
leg
came
too
late
in
an
instant
the
roof
was
cleared
the
young
braves
from
the
maize
clan
were
ungraciously
received
below
a
number
of
their
parents
had
assembled
and
when
the
woman
began
to
expostulate
they
looked
at
the
matter
from
her
point
of
view
they
saw
that
it
was
an
infringement
a
trespass
upon
the
territory
and
rights
of
another
clan
and
treated
their
pugnacious
sons
to
another
instalment
of
bodily
punishment
as
fast
as
they
came
tumbling
from
above
the
final
result
for
the
incipient
warriors
of
the
corn
people
was
that
they
were
ignominiously
driven
home
while
peace
was
thus
restored
upon
the
ground
it
still
looked
quite
stormy
on
the
roof
the
woman
who
had
so
energetically
interfered
at
last
discovered
okoya
who
was
looking
in
blank
amazement
at
this
sudden
change
of
affairs
forthwith
she
made
a
vicious
grab
at
his
ebony
locks
with
the
pointed
remark
down
with
you
you
stinking
weed
but
mitsha
interfered
mother
she
said
gently
do
not
harm
him
he
was
defending
his
brother
and
me
he
is
none
of
the
others
what
the
woman
screamed
was
it
you
whom
they
were
about
to
strike
these
made
of
black
corn
you
my
child
let
me
tell
them
again
what
they
are
and
she
ran
to
the
brink
of
the
roof
raised
handfuls
of
dust
from
it
and
hurled
them
in
the
direction
of
the
caves
of
the
offenders
she
stamped
she
spat
she
raved
and
heaped
upon
the
heads
of
the
corn
people
their
ancestors
and
their
descendants
every
invective
the
queres
language
contains
to
those
below
this
appeared
decidedly
entertaining
the
men
especially
enjoyed
the
performance
but
mitsha
felt
sorry
she
disliked
to
see
her
mother
display
such
frenzy
and
to
hear
her
use
such
vulgar
language
she
pulled
her
wrap
saying
it
is
enough
now
sanaya
do
you
see
that
those
who
wanted
to
hurt
me
are
gone
their
fathers
and
mothers
are
not
guilty
be
quiet
mother
it
is
all
over
now
her
mother
at
last
yielded
to
these
gentle
remonstrances
turned
away
from
the
brink
and
surveyed
the
roof
she
saw
okoya
standing
before
weeping
shyuote
and
scolding
him
what
are
you
doing
to
this
child
asked
mitsha
mother
still
under
the
pressure
of
her
former
excitement
she
was
ready
for
another
fray
he
is
my
brother
and
the
cause
of
the
whole
trouble
okoya
explained
to
her
i
chide
him
for
it
as
it
is
my
duty
to
do
nevertheless
they
had
no
right
to
kill
him
still
less
to
hurt
the
girl
the
woman
had
at
last
had
time
to
scrutinize
the
looks
of
the
young
man
she
herself
was
not
old
and
when
not
under
the
influence
of
passion
was
rather
comely
okoya
handsome
figure
attracted
her
attention
and
she
stepped
nearer
eyeing
him
closely
where
do
you
belong
she
inquired
in
a
quieter
tone
i
am
tanyi
who
is
your
father
zashue
tihua
the
woman
smiled
she
moved
still
nearer
to
the
young
man
and
continued
i
know
your
father
well
he
is
one
of
us
a
koshare
her
eyes
remained
fastened
on
his
features
she
was
manifestly
more
and
more
pleased
with
his
appearance
but
at
the
same
time
she
occasionally
glanced
toward
her
daughter
mitsha
and
it
struck
her
forcibly
that
mitsha
too
was
handsome
i
know
who
you
are
she
said
smilingly
you
are
okoya
tihua
your
little
brother
is
called
shyuote
and
say
koitza
is
your
mother
name
she
is
a
good
woman
but
and
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
always
sick
have
you
any
cotton
she
suddenly
asked
looking
squarely
into
the
eyes
of
the
boy
no
he
replied
and
his
features
coloured
visibly
but
i
have
some
handsome
skins
mitsha
too
seemed
embarrassed
she
started
to
go
into
the
room
below
but
her
mother
called
her
back
sa
uishe
she
coaxed
wo
you
give
the
mot
tza
something
to
eat
the
faces
of
both
young
people
became
fiery
red
he
stood
like
a
statue
and
yet
his
chest
heaved
he
cast
his
eyes
to
the
ground
mitsha
had
turned
her
face
away
her
whole
body
was
trembling
like
a
leaf
her
mother
persisted
take
him
down
into
the
room
and
feed
him
she
repeated
and
smiled
i
have
nothing
murmured
mitsha
if
such
is
the
case
i
shall
go
and
see
myself
with
these
words
the
woman
descended
the
beam
into
the
room
below
leaving
the
two
alone
on
the
roof
standing
motionless
neither
daring
to
look
at
the
other
while
the
colloquy
between
okoya
and
mitsha
mother
was
going
on
shyuote
had
recovered
somewhat
from
his
fright
and
grief
and
had
sneaked
off
once
on
the
ground
he
walked
still
trembling
and
suspiciously
scanning
the
cliff
wherein
the
corn
people
had
their
abodes
as
straight
as
possible
toward
the
big
house
nobody
interfered
with
him
not
even
his
two
defenders
noticed
that
he
had
gone
they
both
remained
standing
silent
with
hearts
beating
anxiously
okoya
the
woman
called
from
below
come
and
eat
mitsha
come
down
and
give
sa
uishe
something
to
eat
a
thrill
went
through
okoya
whole
frame
she
had
called
him
my
child
he
ventured
to
cast
a
furtive
glance
at
the
maiden
mitsha
had
recovered
her
she
returned
his
shy
glance
with
an
open
free
but
sweet
look
and
said
come
and
partake
of
the
food
there
was
no
resisting
an
invitation
from
her
he
smiled
she
returned
the
smile
in
a
timid
way
as
shy
and
embarrassed
as
his
own
she
descended
first
and
okoya
followed
on
the
floor
of
the
room
the
same
chamber
where
tyope
had
taken
rest
the
night
before
stood
the
usual
meal
and
okoya
partook
of
it
modestly
said
his
prayer
of
thanks
and
uttered
a
plain
sincere
hoya
at
the
end
but
instead
of
rising
as
he
would
have
done
at
home
he
remained
squatting
glancing
at
the
two
women
while
he
ate
the
mother
watched
him
eagerly
her
cunning
eyes
moved
from
his
face
toward
that
of
her
daughter
like
sparks
and
gradually
an
expression
of
satisfaction
mingled
with
that
of
a
settled
resolve
appeared
on
her
features
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
two
would
be
a
handsome
pair
they
seemed
as
the
vulgar
saying
goes
made
for
each
other
and
there
was
something
besides
that
told
that
they
were
fond
of
each
other
also
okoya
had
never
before
entered
this
dwelling
but
the
woman
thought
that
they
had
met
before
nay
that
her
desire
had
been
anticipated
inasmuch
as
the
young
people
already
stood
to
each
other
if
not
in
an
intimate
in
a
more
than
merely
friendly
relation
why
do
you
never
come
to
see
us
asked
the
woman
after
okoya
had
finished
his
meal
i
stay
at
the
estufa
during
the
night
was
the
modest
reply
you
need
have
no
fear
she
answered
pleasantly
tyope
and
your
father
are
good
friends
you
should
become
a
koshare
she
exclaimed
okoya
face
clouded
he
did
not
like
the
suggestion
but
nevertheless
asked
is
she
looking
at
mitsha
a
koshare
also
no
we
had
another
child
a
boy
he
was
to
have
become
a
delight
maker
but
he
died
some
time
ago
the
woman
had
it
on
her
lips
to
say
do
you
become
one
in
his
place
as
our
child
but
she
checked
herself
in
time
it
would
have
been
too
bold
a
proposal
okoya
glanced
at
the
daughter
and
said
timidly
if
you
like
i
shall
come
again
to
see
you
and
mitsha
face
displayed
a
happy
smile
at
the
words
while
her
mother
eagerly
nodded
come
as
often
as
you
can
she
replied
we
emphasizing
the
word
strongly
like
it
it
is
well
then
i
will
go
now
said
okoya
rising
his
face
was
radiant
i
must
go
home
lest
shyuote
get
into
more
trouble
he
is
so
mischievous
and
awkward
he
grasped
the
woman
hand
and
breathed
on
it
gave
a
smiling
look
to
the
girl
who
nodded
at
him
with
a
happy
face
and
returned
to
the
roof
again
thence
he
climbed
down
to
the
ground
how
happy
he
felt
the
sun
seemed
to
shine
twice
as
brightly
as
before
the
air
felt
purer
all
around
him
breathed
life
hope
and
bliss
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
he
turned
back
once
more
to
gaze
at
the
house
where
so
much
joy
had
come
to
him
a
pair
of
lustrous
eyes
appeared
in
the
little
of
the
wall
they
were
those
of
the
maiden
which
were
following
him
on
his
homeward
way
tyope
wife
was
right
in
supposing
that
her
daughter
and
okoya
were
not
strangers
to
each
other
and
yet
not
a
single
word
had
passed
between
them
before
beyond
a
casual
greeting
as
often
as
they
had
met
he
had
said
guatzena
and
she
had
responded
with
raua
but
at
every
meeting
his
voice
was
softer
and
hers
more
timid
and
trembling
each
felt
happy
at
the
sight
of
the
other
but
neither
thought
of
speaking
still
less
of
making
any
advances
okoya
was
aware
of
the
fact
which
he
felt
deeply
and
keenly
that
a
wide
breach
a
seemingly
impassable
chasm
existed
between
him
and
the
girl
that
gap
was
the
relation
in
which
he
stood
toward
tyope
the
girl
father
or
rather
the
relation
in
which
he
fancied
himself
to
stand
toward
him
for
tyope
had
hardly
ever
spoken
to
him
still
less
done
him
any
wrong
but
okoya
mother
had
spoken
of
tyope
as
a
bad
man
as
a
dangerous
man
as
one
whom
it
was
okoya
duty
to
avoid
and
so
her
son
feared
tyope
and
dared
not
think
of
the
bad
man
daughter
as
his
future
companion
through
life
now
everything
was
changed
mitsha
mother
had
said
that
tyope
was
a
friend
of
his
father
and
that
tyope
would
not
be
angry
if
okoya
came
to
her
house
then
he
was
not
after
all
the
fiend
that
say
koitza
had
pictured
him
on
the
contrary
he
appeared
to
okoya
since
the
last
interview
in
the
light
of
an
important
personage
okoya
faith
in
his
mother
was
shaken
before
now
he
began
to
think
that
tyope
after
all
while
he
was
certainly
to
him
an
important
man
was
not
as
bad
as
represented
the
koshare
also
appeared
to
him
in
a
new
and
more
favourable
light
the
adroit
suggestion
made
by
the
woman
that
he
should
join
the
society
bore
its
fruits
okoya
felt
not
only
relieved
but
happy
he
felt
elated
over
his
success
he
was
well
trained
in
the
religious
discipline
of
the
indians
and
now
that
he
saw
hope
before
him
his
next
thought
was
one
of
gratitude
toward
that
mother
of
all
who
though
dwelling
at
the
bottom
of
the
lagune
of
shipapu
at
times
and
then
again
in
the
silvery
moon
was
still
watching
over
the
destinies
of
her
children
on
earth
and
to
whose
loving
guidance
he
felt
his
bright
prospects
due
he
had
no
with
him
these
painted
sticks
to
which
feathers
or
down
of
various
birds
according
to
the
nature
of
the
prayer
they
are
to
signify
are
attached
the
aborigine
deposits
wherever
and
whenever
he
feels
like
addressing
himself
to
the
higher
powers
be
it
for
a
request
in
adoration
only
or
for
thanksgiving
in
a
certain
way
the
or
is
a
substitute
for
prayer
inasmuch
as
he
who
has
not
time
may
deposit
it
hurriedly
as
a
votive
offering
the
paint
which
covers
the
piece
of
stick
to
which
the
feather
is
attached
becomes
appropriately
significant
through
its
colours
the
feather
itself
is
the
symbol
of
human
thought
flitting
as
one
set
adrift
in
the
air
toward
heaven
where
dwell
those
above
but
as
in
the
present
instance
the
indian
has
not
always
a
with
him
so
he
has
recourse
to
an
expedient
simple
and
primitive
two
little
sticks
or
twigs
placed
crosswise
and
held
to
their
place
by
a
rock
or
stone
serve
the
same
purpose
in
case
of
emergency
such
accumulations
of
rocks
little
are
plentiful
around
indian
villages
and
they
represent
votive
offerings
symbolizing
as
many
prayers
there
were
a
number
of
them
at
the
rito
around
the
big
house
along
the
fields
and
on
the
trails
leading
up
to
the
mesa
okoya
went
to
the
nearest
one
and
placed
two
twigs
crosswise
on
it
poising
them
with
a
stone
then
he
scattered
sacred
meal
which
he
always
carried
with
him
in
a
small
leather
wallet
and
thanked
the
sanashtyaya
our
mother
with
an
earnest
then
he
turned
homeward
the
very
thought
of
that
home
however
made
his
heart
heavy
and
sad
for
more
and
more
he
became
convinced
that
his
mother
was
false
to
him
the
assertion
made
by
tyope
wife
that
he
was
welcome
in
her
house
and
that
tyope
would
not
object
to
his
visiting
there
worked
another
breach
in
the
faith
he
was
wont
to
place
in
his
mother
words
not
that
the
invitation
to
join
the
koshare
had
exercised
any
influence
upon
his
opinion
regarding
that
society
of
men
and
women
he
mistrusted
he
hated
he
feared
them
as
much
as
ever
but
toward
tyope
personally
he
felt
differently
his
thoughts
were
carried
back
to
the
gloomy
subject
one
by
one
his
doubts
and
misgivings
returned
with
them
and
a
longing
after
some
friend
to
whom
he
might
communicate
his
fears
and
whom
he
might
consult
with
absolute
confidence
as
he
was
thus
pondering
and
walking
on
slowly
and
more
slowly
he
saw
at
some
distance
two
men
climbing
up
toward
where
the
of
the
water
clan
lay
one
of
them
was
his
father
he
recognized
him
at
once
who
was
his
companion
he
stopped
and
looked
it
was
his
father
brother
hayoue
and
with
this
it
seemed
as
if
a
veil
had
suddenly
dropped
from
his
eyes
the
tall
slender
young
man
yonder
who
was
advancing
up
the
declivity
at
such
an
easy
gait
was
the
friend
upon
whom
he
could
fully
rely
the
adviser
who
would
not
at
least
purposely
lead
him
astray
hayoue
was
but
a
few
years
older
than
okoya
the
relations
between
the
two
were
those
of
two
brothers
and
chums
rather
than
those
of
uncle
and
nephew
hayoue
was
not
a
member
of
his
clan
consequently
not
exposed
to
any
influence
which
his
mother
through
her
father
topanashka
might
attempt
to
exert
hayoue
he
knew
disliked
the
koshare
as
much
as
he
disliked
them
himself
and
hayoue
was
thoroughly
trustworthy
and
discreet
though
very
outspoken
if
necessary
and
fearless
yes
hayoue
was
the
friend
in
need
he
so
anxiously
desired
to
find
and
now
that
he
had
found
him
he
resolved
to
seize
upon
the
first
opportunity
of
consulting
him
on
the
subject
that
so
seriously
troubled
his
mind
he
was
so
delighted
at
this
sudden
discovery
as
it
might
be
called
that
he
attributed
it
to
an
inspiration
from
above
and
stood
for
a
moment
in
doubt
whether
he
should
not
return
to
the
and
offer
another
prayer
of
thanks
to
the
mother
above
for
what
he
considered
to
have
been
a
gift
of
her
goodness
to
him
but
the
house
was
too
near
and
he
bethought
himself
of
shyuote
and
what
the
mischievous
urchin
might
have
done
since
he
had
left
him
he
entered
the
front
room
of
his
mother
dwelling
with
a
lighter
and
easier
mind
than
the
day
before
and
what
he
saw
at
once
diverted
his
thoughts
into
another
widely
different
channel
shyuote
sat
in
a
corner
and
his
eyes
were
red
from
crying
beside
him
stood
say
agitated
and
angry
without
giving
her
elder
son
time
to
speak
she
asked
who
sent
the
boy
to
the
fields
i
do
know
replied
okoya
in
astonishment
he
knew
nothing
of
shyuote
morning
rambles
he
must
know
how
could
i
tell
he
says
that
they
drove
him
from
the
corn
because
he
threw
mud
at
a
girl
added
the
mother
that
is
quite
likely
rejoined
his
elder
brother
that
is
why
the
lads
of
the
corn
clan
intended
to
beat
him
i
presume
why
did
you
not
stay
with
your
father
cried
say
because
he
held
his
arm
up
to
his
eyes
and
commenced
to
sob
because
my
father
drove
me
off
why
did
he
drive
you
away
because
he
stopped
then
raised
his
head
as
if
a
sudden
and
wicked
thought
had
flashed
across
his
mind
his
eyes
sparkled
i
dare
not
tell
he
cast
his
eyes
to
the
ground
and
a
bitter
smile
passed
over
his
lips
why
dare
you
not
tell
both
say
and
okoya
inquired
has
sa
nashtio
told
you
not
to
say
anything
about
it
not
he
but
the
koshare
naua
it
was
like
an
explosion
say
koitza
felt
a
terrible
pang
she
stared
vacantly
at
the
wicked
lad
for
a
moment
and
then
turned
and
went
into
the
kitchen
shyuote
wept
aloud
his
brother
looked
down
upon
him
with
an
expression
of
mingled
compassion
and
curiosity
the
doorway
was
suddenly
darkened
by
a
human
form
and
with
the
usual
the
grandfather
topanashka
entered
the
apartment
okoya
stood
up
quickly
and
replied
raua
opona
what
is
the
boy
crying
for
inquired
the
old
man
the
corn
people
tried
to
hurt
him
because
he
threw
something
at
one
of
their
girls
okoya
explained
is
that
all
i
heard
scolding
and
crying
going
on
here
and
so
i
thought
i
would
come
and
see
what
was
the
matter
where
is
your
yaya
say
when
she
heard
her
father
voice
came
out
and
leaned
against
the
entrance
to
the
kitchen
her
face
was
convulsed
her
eyes
glassy
topanashka
scanned
her
features
quietly
and
then
said
in
a
cold
tone
guatzena
she
understood
the
meaning
of
his
cold
searching
gaze
and
gathered
all
her
strength
to
meet
it
with
composure
shyuote
cries
also
she
said
because
his
father
sent
him
home
from
the
fields
why
did
zashue
do
that
this
he
dare
not
tell
for
the
koshare
naua
her
voice
trembled
at
the
mention
of
the
name
forbade
him
to
say
anything
about
it
her
eyes
clung
to
the
features
of
her
father
topanashka
turned
away
slowly
and
quietly
and
she
followed
him
to
the
door
as
he
was
crossing
the
threshold
he
whispered
to
her
there
is
nothing
new
as
yet
chapter
the
people
of
the
water
clan
dwelt
at
the
western
end
of
the
cliffs
which
border
the
tyuonyi
on
the
north
they
occupied
some
twenty
caves
scooped
out
along
the
base
of
the
rock
and
an
upper
tier
of
a
dozen
more
separated
from
the
lower
by
a
thickness
of
rock
averaging
not
over
three
feet
this
group
of
and
vestiges
thereof
are
still
visible
at
this
day
lay
in
a
angle
formed
by
the
cliffs
which
overhang
in
such
a
manner
as
to
form
a
sheltered
nook
open
to
the
south
ascent
to
their
base
is
quite
steep
and
great
heaps
of
débris
cover
the
slope
the
gorge
is
narrow
a
dense
thicket
interspersed
with
lines
the
course
of
the
brook
and
the
declivity
forming
the
southern
border
of
the
rito
approaches
the
bottom
in
rocky
steps
traversed
laterally
by
ledges
overgrown
with
scrubby
vegetation
vestiges
of
former
occupancy
are
still
scattered
about
the
caves
some
of
these
furnish
a
clew
to
the
manner
in
which
the
dwellings
were
formed
by
scraping
and
burrowing
splinters
of
obsidian
and
of
basalt
sharp
fragments
resembling
clumsy
chisels
or
knives
served
to
dig
an
oblong
hole
in
the
soft
pumice
or
tufa
of
the
cliff
after
this
narrow
cavity
had
penetrated
a
depth
of
one
or
two
feet
the
artisan
began
to
enlarge
it
inside
until
a
room
was
formed
for
which
the
tunnelled
entrance
served
as
a
doorway
the
room
or
cell
was
gradually
finished
in
a
quadrangular
or
polygonal
shape
with
a
ceiling
high
enough
to
permit
a
person
of
average
size
to
stand
erect
not
unfrequently
side
rooms
were
excavated
connecting
with
the
first
by
low
apertures
to
pass
through
which
it
was
necessary
to
stoop
or
even
to
creep
on
all
fours
these
passages
were
too
low
for
doorways
too
short
to
deserve
the
name
of
tunnels
into
the
front
apartment
light
and
air
were
admitted
through
the
entrance
and
sometimes
through
small
apertures
the
side
cells
were
utterly
dark
except
where
excavated
parallel
to
the
face
of
the
rock
when
sometimes
another
entrance
was
opened
to
the
front
sometimes
an
only
admitted
light
and
air
if
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day
when
shyuote
had
his
perilous
adventure
with
the
young
people
of
the
corn
clan
we
had
been
able
to
peep
into
the
third
one
of
the
caves
counting
from
the
west
end
of
the
group
inhabited
by
the
water
people
we
should
have
found
the
apartment
empty
that
is
as
far
as
human
occupancy
was
concerned
but
not
deserted
for
while
its
owner
was
not
there
ample
signs
of
his
presence
only
a
short
time
before
could
be
detected
everywhere
in
the
fireplace
wood
was
smouldering
and
a
faint
smoke
rising
from
this
found
egress
through
a
crude
chimney
this
was
built
over
the
hearth
with
two
vertical
side
slabs
of
pumice
supporting
a
perforated
square
flag
over
which
a
primitive
flue
made
of
rubble
cemented
by
mud
led
to
a
circular
opening
in
the
front
wall
of
the
cave
in
a
corner
stood
the
frame
for
the
or
and
in
it
the
three
plates
of
lava
on
which
the
indian
crushes
and
pulverizes
his
maize
were
placed
in
the
convenient
slanting
position
not
only
the
prismatic
but
freshly
ground
meal
also
lay
in
the
stone
casings
of
the
primitive
mill
and
on
these
the
plates
themselves
deerskins
and
cotton
wraps
were
rolled
in
a
bundle
in
another
corner
others
hung
on
a
line
made
of
rawhide
and
stretched
across
one
end
of
the
room
fastened
to
wooden
pins
driven
into
the
soft
rock
on
the
floor
to
which
a
thick
coating
of
mud
washed
with
blood
and
smoothed
gave
a
black
glossy
appearance
there
were
beside
here
a
few
stone
axes
with
handles
there
some
black
sooty
pots
painted
bowls
and
finally
the
inevitable
with
wide
body
and
narrow
top
decorated
in
the
usual
style
with
geometrical
and
symbolical
figures
painted
in
red
and
black
on
whitish
ground
the
walls
of
the
cave
were
burnished
with
burnt
gypsum
the
ceiling
was
covered
by
a
thick
coat
of
soot
and
a
band
of
yellow
ochre
like
wainscoting
ran
along
the
base
of
the
sides
the
owner
of
this
troglodytic
home
however
is
not
to
be
seen
but
in
a
side
chamber
which
communicates
with
this
apartment
through
one
of
the
dark
and
low
passages
just
described
a
rustling
sound
is
heard
as
of
some
one
rummaging
about
in
darkness
after
a
while
a
woman
head
peeps
through
the
passage
into
the
outer
room
and
little
by
little
the
whole
body
emerges
forcing
itself
through
the
narrow
opening
she
rises
and
stands
erect
in
front
of
the
hearth
and
the
sunbeam
which
still
enters
the
apartment
by
the
round
hole
above
the
fireplace
strikes
her
features
full
and
enables
us
to
scan
them
the
woman
into
whose
dwelling
we
have
pryed
and
who
stands
now
in
the
dim
chamber
as
sole
occupant
and
owner
is
shotaye
tyope
former
wife
and
the
friend
who
has
given
say
koitza
such
ill
advice
if
shotaye
be
a
witch
she
certainly
is
far
from
displaying
the
appearance
often
attributed
to
the
female
sorcerer
there
is
even
something
decidedly
fascinating
about
her
shotaye
although
near
the
forties
is
for
an
indian
woman
undoubtedly
no
wonder
some
other
women
of
the
tribe
are
afraid
of
her
she
is
tall
and
well
rounded
and
her
chest
is
of
that
fulnesss
that
develops
at
an
early
age
in
the
women
of
the
pueblos
her
face
is
even
pretty
her
lips
are
pouting
and
sensual
the
nose
small
and
shaped
like
a
short
pointed
beak
the
high
while
the
chin
indicates
remarkable
determination
magnificent
black
hair
streams
down
her
back
it
is
as
full
as
a
wave
as
lustrous
as
polished
obsidian
her
dress
consists
of
a
buckskin
wrap
without
girdle
embroidered
at
the
lower
end
with
bracelets
of
white
shells
a
necklace
of
feldspar
crystals
and
turquoises
and
strings
of
yellow
cotton
threads
around
her
ankles
complete
the
costume
such
is
the
woman
who
has
played
and
still
plays
an
ominous
part
in
the
history
of
okoya
mother
and
in
the
history
of
the
people
at
the
rito
de
los
frijoles
now
that
we
have
seen
her
home
and
her
person
let
us
proceed
with
the
tale
of
her
doings
on
the
afternoon
to
which
the
close
of
the
preceding
chapter
has
been
devoted
shotaye
had
been
rummaging
about
in
the
inner
cell
of
her
rocky
house
in
search
of
some
medicinal
plant
for
that
cell
was
her
storeroom
laboratory
and
workshop
but
as
the
room
was
without
light
at
all
she
had
entered
it
with
a
lighted
stick
in
her
hand
and
just
as
she
had
begun
her
search
the
flame
had
died
out
so
after
a
vain
attempt
by
groping
in
darkness
she
crawled
back
to
the
exterior
apartment
and
knelt
down
in
front
of
the
hearth
to
fan
the
coals
with
her
breath
and
thus
obtain
another
torch
for
her
explorations
at
that
moment
the
deerskin
robe
closing
the
entrance
to
her
grotto
was
timidly
lifted
and
a
feeble
voice
called
the
usual
greeting
opona
replied
shotaye
turning
toward
the
doorway
a
lithe
figure
crept
into
the
cave
when
near
the
fireplace
it
stood
still
enabling
the
mistress
of
the
dwelling
to
recognize
the
features
of
say
her
friend
and
now
fully
recovered
patient
but
how
different
was
say
appearance
from
what
it
was
when
shotaye
a
few
days
ago
saw
her
last
how
changed
how
thin
and
wan
her
cheeks
how
sunken
her
eyes
how
sallow
and
sickly
her
complexion
her
face
seemed
to
bear
the
seal
of
approaching
death
for
the
eyes
stared
expressionless
the
mouth
twitched
without
speaking
but
one
thought
seized
shotaye
that
her
friend
must
be
ill
very
very
ill
that
the
old
disease
had
returned
in
full
force
and
had
clutched
her
anew
with
perhaps
irresistible
power
anxiously
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
scanned
the
face
of
the
invalid
what
ails
you
my
sister
she
inquired
tenderly
has
disease
come
on
you
again
speak
sa
uishe
speak
to
me
that
i
may
know
her
visitor
only
shook
her
head
and
glanced
about
as
if
seeking
a
place
to
rest
herself
the
gathered
hurriedly
a
few
robes
folded
them
so
as
to
make
a
cushion
near
the
hearth
and
then
gently
urged
say
to
sit
down
on
this
soft
and
easy
seat
she
yielded
and
then
remained
motionless
her
glassy
eyes
staring
vacantly
at
the
floor
sister
shotaye
reiterated
sister
what
ails
you
speak
and
i
will
do
all
i
can
for
you
but
the
other
merely
shook
her
head
and
began
to
shiver
shotaye
noticed
the
wristbands
of
red
leather
on
her
arms
and
it
startled
her
she
asked
eagerly
why
do
you
wear
in
trouble
the
colour
that
should
make
our
hearts
glad
what
has
happened
to
you
that
causes
you
to
seek
relief
for
your
distress
the
tone
of
her
voice
sounded
no
longer
like
entreaty
it
was
an
anxious
nay
stern
command
okoya
mother
raised
her
eyes
with
an
expression
of
intense
misery
she
threw
toward
her
questioner
a
look
imploring
relief
and
protection
and
finally
gasped
they
know
everything
then
her
head
dropped
on
her
knees
she
grasped
her
hair
covered
her
face
and
chest
with
it
and
broke
out
in
convulsive
sobs
they
know
everything
shotaye
repeated
who
know
everything
suddenly
the
truth
seemed
to
flash
upon
her
mind
what
the
koshare
she
cried
in
terror
convulsive
sobs
and
groans
were
the
only
reply
to
her
exclamation
they
amply
confirmed
her
worst
apprehensions
the
koshare
know
all
unconsciously
the
uttered
these
words
while
staring
into
the
remnant
of
gleaming
coals
on
the
hearth
then
she
became
silent
neither
could
say
koitza
utter
a
word
only
from
time
to
time
her
spasmodic
sobs
broke
the
stillness
of
the
room
the
bright
disk
which
the
light
from
the
outside
painted
on
the
wall
opposite
was
fading
little
by
little
a
sign
of
approaching
sunset
shotaye
features
displayed
few
signs
of
the
terror
which
her
disclosures
had
produced
soon
her
face
betokened
that
fear
could
not
retain
its
hold
long
on
her
resolute
mind
that
intense
reflection
had
superseded
dismay
she
turned
to
her
visitor
and
asked
tell
me
sister
how
you
came
to
know
that
the
delight
makers
are
acquainted
with
your
doings
tell
me
and
do
not
weep
and
as
say
remained
silent
and
immovable
she
crouched
beside
her
removed
her
hair
gently
from
her
face
then
raised
her
head
and
placed
it
so
as
to
rest
on
her
bosom
then
she
looked
deep
into
the
eyes
of
the
poor
woman
they
were
glassy
and
almost
lifeless
while
thus
gazing
intently
at
say
shotaye
features
changed
and
became
sad
and
dejected
it
was
for
a
moment
only
soon
the
expression
of
hopelessness
vanished
and
the
lines
of
her
face
became
resolute
hard
and
determined
surprise
had
yielded
to
reflection
reflection
to
pity
and
remorse
now
remorse
in
turn
gave
way
to
determination
shotaye
felt
that
she
much
rather
than
her
friend
was
lost
irretrievably
lost
but
her
energetic
nature
demanded
that
she
should
see
the
situation
clearly
although
the
spasmodic
hints
of
say
her
broken
words
spoke
enough
she
wanted
more
her
mind
craved
the
full
truth
however
terrible
it
might
prove
say
koitza
had
slowly
recovered
from
her
stupor
she
became
quieter
and
quieter
in
the
arms
of
her
resolute
and
sympathizing
friend
consciousness
returned
she
sobbed
no
more
and
from
time
to
time
would
raise
her
eyes
with
a
look
that
besought
pity
mercy
and
assistance
the
eagerly
watched
these
changes
and
repeated
her
previous
query
how
do
you
know
that
the
koshare
are
aware
of
it
sa
nashtio
told
me
moaned
the
poor
woman
shotaye
sighed
this
was
bad
news
indeed
she
muttered
this
is
bad
very
bad
if
the
maseua
knows
it
then
the
tapop
will
not
be
long
without
notice
the
tapop
knows
nothing
breathed
say
but
how
can
the
maseua
have
been
informed
without
the
knowledge
of
the
other
shotaye
asked
with
surprise
he
is
my
father
replied
say
and
wept
aloud
he
is
my
father
and
yet
she
started
to
rise
and
grasped
her
hair
with
both
hands
screaming
he
has
to
kill
me
with
his
own
hands
so
loud
and
piercing
was
her
shriek
that
shotaye
was
seized
with
sudden
fright
rising
quickly
she
ran
to
the
doorway
and
peeped
outside
to
see
if
the
scream
had
attracted
attention
but
there
appeared
to
be
nobody
about
except
a
few
children
who
were
playing
and
romping
in
front
of
the
caves
and
whose
cries
had
drowned
the
shriek
reassured
she
returned
to
say
who
was
lying
with
her
face
on
the
floor
tearing
her
hair
and
uttering
low
convulsive
groans
shotaye
grew
frightened
and
brought
water
in
a
gourd
she
moistened
her
forehead
and
hands
with
the
liquid
rubbed
her
face
and
thus
finally
brought
her
back
to
some
composure
after
drinking
some
water
say
sat
on
the
robes
again
shivering
and
gasping
her
mind
seemed
entirely
gone
the
expression
of
her
features
was
akin
to
idiocy
the
room
had
grown
darker
night
was
approaching
as
soon
as
she
appeared
to
be
quiet
shotaye
felt
tempted
to
resume
her
questionings
but
she
bethought
herself
of
the
late
hour
and
of
the
suspicion
which
might
arise
in
case
say
koitza
should
not
be
home
in
time
still
she
must
ask
some
questions
her
positive
mind
required
some
additional
knowledge
which
must
be
gained
ere
she
could
afford
to
let
her
visitor
return
home
shotaye
returned
to
the
entrance
looked
stealthily
outside
and
listened
dusk
had
set
in
and
the
bottom
of
the
gorge
was
wrapped
in
twilight
the
shrubbery
along
the
brook
appeared
dim
and
pale
the
lofty
pines
looked
like
black
monuments
on
the
southern
declivity
all
detail
had
vanished
but
the
top
of
the
southern
mesa
glistened
yet
like
a
golden
seam
in
the
recess
formed
by
the
angle
of
the
cliffs
which
contained
her
home
the
usual
bustle
of
the
evening
hours
prevailed
and
laughter
merry
and
boisterous
issued
from
a
cave
opposite
that
where
shotaye
concealed
by
folds
of
the
curtain
stood
watching
with
eye
and
ear
in
those
caves
fronting
hers
dwelt
the
family
of
zashue
say
husband
thence
sounded
the
merriment
and
the
woman
recognized
familiar
voices
surely
enough
hayoue
was
there
and
there
could
be
no
mistake
that
clear
laugh
was
from
zashue
himself
shotaye
dropped
the
curtain
and
turned
back
considerably
relieved
if
zashue
was
at
his
mother
and
home
she
reasoned
he
would
not
return
to
the
big
house
that
night
and
since
he
was
so
gay
so
merry
it
was
not
likely
that
he
knew
anything
of
the
terrible
accusation
against
his
wife
and
her
if
that
were
the
case
there
was
no
immediate
danger
since
all
the
koshare
were
not
informed
of
the
matter
returning
to
the
hearth
she
poked
the
embers
placed
on
them
another
stick
of
pitchy
wood
and
fanned
it
with
her
breath
until
the
flames
burst
forth
lively
and
bright
until
then
say
had
remained
motionless
in
her
seat
she
had
taken
no
notice
of
her
friend
movements
but
when
the
wood
flamed
and
a
warm
glow
began
to
spread
over
the
apartment
she
started
like
one
whose
dreams
are
suddenly
disturbed
and
began
to
speak
i
must
go
she
exclaimed
anxiously
i
must
go
home
i
must
cook
for
zashue
he
is
looking
for
me
i
must
go
and
she
attempted
to
rise
shotaye
tried
to
quell
her
sudden
apprehension
but
she
kept
on
with
growing
excitement
i
must
let
me
go
let
me
go
for
he
is
looking
for
me
he
is
not
assured
the
other
be
quiet
he
is
yonder
with
his
people
in
the
cave
there
he
sits
and
there
he
will
stay
till
late
a
sudden
tremor
seized
the
body
of
say
her
hands
shook
like
aspen
leaves
is
he
there
she
gasped
then
he
is
coming
after
me
is
he
not
a
koshare
her
eyes
glistened
with
that
peculiar
glare
which
betokens
aberration
of
the
mind
any
ordinary
indian
woman
would
have
concluded
from
the
appearance
and
utterances
of
say
that
she
was
hopelessly
insane
and
would
either
have
resorted
to
incantations
or
left
her
in
terror
shotaye
although
very
much
frightened
did
not
think
of
desertion
but
only
of
relief
with
keen
she
said
in
a
decided
and
convincing
tone
fear
nothing
sa
tao
he
will
not
come
for
he
knows
nothing
nothing
inquired
say
looking
at
her
with
the
shy
and
sly
glance
of
a
doubting
maniac
nothing
at
all
shotaye
exclaimed
firmly
she
had
recovered
her
ascendency
she
directed
her
glance
commanding
and
convincing
straight
at
the
wavering
gaze
of
the
excited
woman
whose
look
became
dim
and
finally
meek
shotaye
took
advantage
of
the
change
zashue
knows
nothing
at
all
she
asserted
and
that
is
very
very
good
for
it
gives
us
hope
but
if
they
tell
him
and
the
anxious
look
came
back
to
her
face
let
them
tell
if
they
choose
defiantly
exclaimed
the
other
afterward
we
shall
see
say
shook
her
head
in
doubt
but
how
did
the
koshare
come
to
know
about
it
shotaye
again
pressed
the
main
question
i
do
not
know
sighed
say
and
she
again
stared
into
the
fire
and
her
face
quivered
suspiciously
the
quickly
interjected
what
do
the
delight
makers
really
know
about
us
they
know
they
know
that
i
spoke
to
the
corn
is
that
all
no
yes
no
they
know
more
she
spoke
with
greater
vivacity
and
in
a
natural
tone
of
voice

know
about

too
a
deep
sigh
followed
this
reply
and
tears
came
to
her
eyes
say
was
herself
again
shotaye
also
heaved
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
her
friend
mind
was
restored
and
she
had
gained
the
information
but
it
would
have
been
dangerous
to
proceed
further
in
this
conversation
lest
the
cloud
which
had
threatened
say
mental
powers
should
return
and
settle
permanently
so
after
a
short
silence
she
turned
to
her
friend
and
said
in
a
positive
tone
sister
go
home
now
and
rest
easy
nothing
is
lost
as
yet
go
home
be
quiet
and
attend
to
your
work

usual

but

anxiously
exclaimed
leave
them
to

the
other
answered
and
so
powerful
was
her
influence
on
the
timid
mind
of
her
visitor
so
unbounded
the
confidence
which
the
latter
had
in
her
abilities
and
her
faithfulness
that
say
rose
without
a
word
and
like
an
obedient
child
covering
her
head
with
one
corner
of
her
wrap
went
out
and
meekly
strolled
home
it
was
night
and
nobody
noticed
her
okoya
was
already
at
the

and
the
little

were
asleep
say
lay
down
beside
her
sleeping

and
soon
sank
into
a
heavy
slumber
her
body

rest
which
the
mind
might
have
denied
to
her

wanted
the

to
cook
her
food
next
in
order
to
brighten
the
room
for
with
the
dark
and
tangled
subject
on
her
mind
she
felt
the
need
of
light
and
warmth
as
her
companions
in
musing
when
the
flames
rustled
and
crackled
shotaye
squatted
down
in
front
of
them
folded
her
arms
around
her
knees
and
began
to
think
she
felt
far
from
being
as
reassured
about
the
outlook
as
she
had
pretended
to
be
when
she
sent
say
koitza
home
with
soothing
and
comforting
words
but
the
preservation
of
her
friend
mental
powers
was
an
imperative
necessity
had
say
been
permitted
to
fall
a
prey
to
her
momentary
excitement
everything
would
have
been
lost
for
shotaye
had
say
mind
given
way
permanently
the
cause
of
that
calamity
would
have
been
attributed
to
her
and
she
would
have
been
charged
with
her
friend
insanity
in
addition
to
the
charge
of
witchcraft
already
being
formulated
these
thoughts
however
came
to
her
now
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
and
by
the
fireside
so
long
as
her
poor
friend
was
with
her
she
had
acted
almost
instinctively
with
the
quick
grasp
of
an
active
intellect
and
under
the
good
impulses
of
compassion
and
attachment
now
that
she
was
alone
the
time
had
come
to
ponder
and
shotaye
weighed
in
her
mind
the
liabilities
and
assets
of
her
situation
she
began
to
calculate
the
probabilities
for
and
against
it
was
not
difficult
for
her
to
escape
but
this
was
only
possible
when
attempted
alone
with
say
koitza
flight
was
next
to
impossible
beside
it
appeared
very
unlikely
to
her
that
the
woman
would
flee
from
her
children

of
the
as
for
shotaye
the
case
was
different
she
might
leave
her
cave
and
her
scanty
effects
at
any
time
provided
she
knew
where
to
go
this
was
not
so
easy
to
determine
the
navajos
or
dinne
haunted
the
country
around
the
tyuonyi
and
in
case
she
fell
in
with
one
or
more
of
their
number
it
became
a
matter
of
life
or
death
the
moshome
or
enemies
of
her
tribe
might
take
a
fancy
to
the
woman
and
spare
her
but
they
might
feel
wicked
and

her
death
appeared
after
all
not
such
a
terrible
misfortune
for
under
present
circumstances
what
else
could
she
expect
at
the
rito
but
a
horrible
and
atrocious
death
but
shotaye
was
intent
upon
living
not
so
much
for
the
sake
of
life
itself
although
it
had
many
sensual
charms
for
her
as
out
of
a
spirit
of
combativeness
resulting
from
her
resolute
character
as
well
as
from
the
constant
struggles
which
she
had
undergone
during
the
time
of
her
separation
from
her
husband
she
felt
inclined
to
live
if
possible
in
spite
of
her
enemies
to
endure
the
lot
of
a
captive
among
the
navajos
was
repulsive
to
her
instincts
she
hated
to
be
a
drudge
admitting
that
she
succeeded
in
eluding
those
enemies
whither
was
she
to
direct
her
flight
that
there
were
village
communities
similar
to
her
own
at
a
remote
distance
was
known
to
her
but
she
was
aware
of
only
one
in
which
she
might
be
received
and
that
belonged
to
the
tehuas
of
whom
she
knew
that
a
branch
dwelt
in
the
mountains
west
of
the
river
inhabiting
caves
somewhere
in
the
rocks
at
one
day
journey
more
or
less
from
the
rito
between
these
tehuas
and
the
queres
of
the
tyuonyi
there
was
occasional
intercourse
and
a
fairly
beaten
trail
led
from
one
place
to
the
other
but
this
intercourse
was
so
much
interrupted
by
hostilities
and
the
navajos
rendered
the
trail
so
insecure
beside
that
she
had
never
paid
much
attention
to
it
still
there
was
no
doubt
in
her
mind
that
if
she
reached
the
habitations
of
the
tehuas
above
where
the
pueblo
of
santa
clara
now
stands
a
hospitable
reception
would
be
extended
to
her
but
could
she
leave
say
alone
to
her
dismal
fate
after
all
death
was
not
such
a
fearful
thing
so
long
as
no
torture
preceded
or
accompanied
it
death
must
come
to
her
once
at
all
events
and
then
what
of
it
there
need
be
no
care
for
the
hereafter
according
to
her
creed
the
pueblo
indian
knows
of
no
atonement
after
dying
all
sins
all
crimes
are
punished
during
this
life
when
the
soul
is
released
from
the
thralls
of
this
body
and
its
surrounding
nature
it
goes
to
shipapu
at
the
bottom
of
the
lagune
where
there
is
eternal
dancing
and
feasting
and
where
everything
goes
on
as
here
upon
earth
but
with
less
pain
care
anguish
and
danger
why
therefore
shun
death
shotaye
was
in
what
we
should
call
a
philosophic
mood
such
careless
philosophy
may
temporarily
ease
the
mind
since
it
stifles
for
a
moment
the
pangs
of
apprehension
and
dread
but
with
the
temporary
relief
which
shotaye
felt
the
demands
of
physical
nature
grew
more
apparent
in
other
words
she
felt
hungry
and
the
more
so
as
being
now
almost
resolved
to
suffer
death
with
resignation
it
was
imperative
to
live
and
consequently
to
eat
until
death
should
knock
at
her
door
she
poured
a
good
portion
of
the
now
boiling
stew
into
a
smaller
bowl
and
began
to
fish
out
the
morsels
with
her
fingers
while
between
times
she
drank
of
the
broth
the
warm
food
comforted
her
gave
her
strength
and
aroused
her
vital
powers
which
arduous
thinking
had
almost
put
to
sleep
she
placed
the
pot
with
the
stew
in
a
corner
and
sat
down
again
leaning
against
the
wall
no
sleepiness
affected
her
there
was
too
much
to
think
of
as
yet
her
thoughts
returned
to
the
absorbing
subject
of
the
day
and
with
these
thoughts
random
at
first
a
pale
wan
figure
rose
before
her
inner
eye
a
form
well
only
too
well
known
to
her
that
of
say
koitza
she
saw
that
figure
as
she
had
seen
it
not
long
ago
crouching
before
that
very
fire
in
bitterest
despair
bewailing
her
own
lot
lamenting
her
imminent
untimely
death
and
yet
without
one
single
word
of
reproach
for
her
who
had
beguiled
her
into
doing
what
now
might
result
in
the
destruction
of
both
was
not
that
thin
trembling
woman
her
victim
was
she
not
the
one
who
had
led
say
astray
the
indian
knows
not
what
conscience
is
but
he
feels
it
all
the
same
and
shotaye
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
remorse
nevertheless
grew
sad
indeed
she
it
was
who
had
beguiled
the
poor
frail
creature
she
it
was
who
had
caused
her
to
perform
an
act
which
however
immaterial
in
fact
still
entailed
punishment
of
the
severest
kind
according
to
indian
notions
and
creed
she
was
the
real
culprit
not
say
poor
innocent
say
shotaye
felt
that
she
had
done
wrong
and
that
she
alone
deserved
to
suffer
but
would
her
punishment
save
the
other
hardly
according
to
indian
ideas
therefore
while
it
dawned
upon
her
that
by
accusing
herself
boldly
and
publicly
she
might
perhaps
ward
off
the
blow
from
the
head
of
her
meek
and
gentle
accomplice
that
thought
was
quickly
stifled
by
the
other
that
it
was
impracticable
again
a
voice
within
her
spoke
boldly
save
yourself
regardless
of
the
other
yet
she
discarded
that
advice
she
could
not
forsake
her
victim
for
in
addition
to
the
legitimate
motives
of
sympathy
another
and
stronger
reason
prevailed
the
dread
of
the
very
powers
whom
she
thought
to
have
invoked
in
say
behalf
and
to
whose
dark
realm
she
fancied
that
she
would
be
fettered
and
still
faster
riveted
by
committing
an
action
which
she
regarded
as
worse
than
all
her
other
deeds
dismissing
every
thought
of
self
she
resolved
to
remain
true
to
say
happen
what
might
shotaye
had
almost
become
part
of
the
power
that
still
produceth
good
whilst
ever
scheming
she
believed
that
death
stood
plainly
at
her
door
nevertheless
she
hated
to
die
the
philosophy
of
careless
frivolous
resignation
could
not
satisfy
her
strong
vitality
still
less
her
stronger
feelings
of
hatred
against
her
enemies
she
felt
that
there
might
be
a
bare
possibility
of
saving
her
companion
and
the
wish
to
save
herself
at
the
same
time
and
in
the
very
teeth
as
it
were
of
the
koshare
grew
stronger
and
stronger
it
waxed
to
an
intense
longing
for
life
and
revenge
but
what
was
to
be
done
there
was
the
riddle
and
to
solve
it
she
thought
and
thought
shotaye
became
oblivious
of
all
around
her
completely
absorbed
in
her
musings
it
thus
escaped
her
notice
that
the
curtain
over
the
doorway
had
been
cautiously
lifted
several
times
and
that
a
human
face
had
peered
into
the
apartment
she
even
failed
to
hear
the
shuffling
step
of
two
men
who
stealthily
entered
the
room
only
when
they
stood
quite
near
her
did
the
woman
start
and
look
up
both
men
broke
out
into
roaring
laughter
at
her
surprise
shotaye
grew
angry
why
do
you
come
in
so
unceremoniously
she
cried
why
do
you
sneak
in
here
like
a
moshome
or
like
a
prairie
wolf
after
carrion
can
not
you
speak
you
bear
she
scolded
without
rising
her
anger
increased
the
merriment
of
the
intruders
one
of
them
threw
himself
down
by
her
side
forced
his
head
into
her
lap
attempting
to
stroke
her
cheeks
she
pushed
him
from
her
and
recognized
in
him
the
gallant
zashue
say
koitza
husband
he
grasped
both
her
hands
this
she
allowed
but
continued
scolding
go
away
you
hare
let
me
alone
he
again
reached
toward
her
face
but
she
avoided
him
go
home
to
your
woman
i
have
no
use
for
you
the
men
laughed
and
laughed
and
the
other
one
knelt
down
before
her
looking
straight
into
her
face
with
immoderate
merriment
then
she
became
seriously
angry
what
do
you
want
here
she
cried
and
when
the
first
one
attempted
to
encircle
her
waist
she
pushed
him
from
her
with
such
force
that
he
fell
aside
then
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
zashue
followed
be
not
angry
sister
he
said
rubbing
his
sore
shoulder
we
mean
you
no
harm
go
home
and
be
good
to
your
woman
later
on
i
will
he
continued
but
first
we
want
to
see
you
and
talk
to
you
said
hayoue
for
he
was
zashue
companion
afterward
i
shall
go
he
emphasized
the
i
and
grinned
yes
you
are
likely
to
go
home
she
exclaimed
to
mitsha
you
will
go
not
to
your
mother
dwelling
mitsha
is
a
good
girl
replied
the
young
man
but
i
never
go
to
see
her
his
brother
meanwhile
attempted
to
approach
the
woman
again
but
she
forbade
it
go
away
zashue
i
tell
you
for
the
last
time
her
speech
and
manner
of
action
were
very
positive
why
do
you
drive
us
away
he
said
in
a
tone
of
disappointment
i
do
not
drive
you
away
replied
shotaye
you
may
stay
here
a
while
but
then
both
of
you
must
leave
me
her
eyes
nevertheless
gazed
at
the
two
handsome
forms
with
evident
pleasure
but
soon
another
thought
arose
sit
down
she
added
quietly
as
she
grasped
after
the
placed
it
on
the
fire
and
sat
down
so
that
she
was
in
the
shadow
whereas
she
could
plainly
see
the
features
of
both
men
the
visitors
had
squatted
also
they
feared
to
arouse
the
woman
anger
and
the
surprise
they
had
planned
had
failed
hayoue
spoke
up
first
you
are
good
sanaya
you
give
us
food
indeed
she
remonstrated
when
i
am
not
willing
to
do
as
you
want
you
call
me
mother
and
make
an
old
woman
of
me
she
looked
at
the
young
man
smiling
and
winked
at
him
you
are
not
very
young
after
all
he
teased
you
might
easily
be
my
mother
what
i
your
mother
the
mother
of
such
an
elk
you
have
one
mother
already
and
if
you
need
another
go
to
mitsha
mother
with
these
words
she
fixed
her
gaze
on
the
youth
searchingly
and
inquiringly
as
her
face
was
in
the
shadow
hayoue
could
not
well
notice
its
expression
but
he
said
again
and
very
emphatically
i
tell
you
once
more
koitza
that
i
will
not
have
anything
to
do
with
the
girl
she
is
all
right
but
he
stopped
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
zashue
interjected
why
not
tyope
would
then
be
your
nashtio
for
that
very
reason
i
do
not
want
his
daughter
hayoue
exclaimed
looking
straight
at
his
brother
he
was
in
earnest
about
this
matter
and
whenever
hayoue
grew
serious
it
was
best
not
to
tease
him
too
much
shotaye
had
treasured
every
word
noticed
every
look
and
gesture
of
course
she
as
tyope
former
wife
took
care
not
to
take
part
in
the
conversation
as
far
as
tyope
was
concerned
zashue
turned
to
her
with
the
query
sam
m
have
you
any
feathers
shotaye
was
startled
what
might
be
the
import
of
this
suspicious
inquiry
did
he
know
about
her
affair
and
come
only
as
a
spy
she
withheld
her
answer
for
a
moment
just
time
enough
for
reflection
it
was
better
to
seem
unconcerned
so
she
replied
quietly
i
have
if
you
have
hawk
feathers
will
you
give
me
some
the
mention
of
hawk
feathers
reassured
shotaye
at
the
same
time
it
indicated
to
her
a
prospective
trade
and
the
woman
had
always
an
eye
to
business
so
she
placed
both
elbows
on
her
knees
looked
straight
at
zashue
and
inquired
what
will
you
give
me
for
them
nothing
replied
zashue
with
a
laugh
promise
her
the
next
owl
that
you
may
find
hayoue
taunted
be
still
you
crow
scolded
shotaye
with
indignation
you
need
owl
eyes
that
you
may
sneak
about
in
the
dark
after
the
girls
there
is
not
a
single
maiden
safe
when
you
are
at
the
tyuonyi
and
no
man
is
safe
from
you
retorted
the
young
man
you
are
safe
at
any
rate
when
you
call
me
a
you
say
the
truth
he
answered
else
i
would
not
have
come
to
you
shotaye
understood
the
venomous
allusion
and
was
going
to
retort
but
bethought
herself
in
time
and
only
said
in
a
contemptuous
tone
why
should
i
quarrel
with
you
uak
then
turning
to
zashue
and
changing
the
subject
how
many
feathers
do
you
want
and
what
will
you
give
me
for
them
four
but
they
must
be
long
ones
what
will
you
give
me
for
them
let
me
see
the
feathers
with
this
he
rose
without
replying
shotaye
poured
out
two
little
bowls
of
broth
placed
them
before
her
visitors
said
eat
took
a
lighted
stick
from
the
hearth
and
crawled
into
the
dark
passage
leading
to
her
magazine
soon
she
was
heard
to
rummage
about
in
that
apartment
and
a
faint
glow
illuminated
the
low
tunnel
while
the
woman
was
busy
searching
for
the
feathers
the
two
men
partook
of
the
food
she
had
set
before
them
sparingly
as
it
was
a
mere
matter
of
etiquette
but
while
eating
they
exchanged
sly
glances
and
winks
like
bad
boys
bent
upon
some
mischief
at
last
as
shotaye
did
not
return
zashue
stealthily
arose
removed
one
of
the
heavy
from
its
frame
and
placed
it
across
the
mouth
of
the
gangway
then
he
stretched
himself
at
full
length
on
the
floor
with
his
back
leaning
against
the
slab
hayoue
watched
him
and
chuckled
the
light
of
the
torch
shone
through
the
space
which
the
slab
could
not
cover
the
mistress
of
the
cave
was
coming
back
very
soon
however
the
light
disappeared
and
all
grew
silent
the
firebrand
had
been
extinguished
the
woman
was
inside
but
kept
perfectly
still
giving
no
signs
of
impatience
or
disappointment
the
mischievous
men
looked
at
each
other
in
astonishment
they
had
not
expected
that
they
waited
and
waited
nothing
stirred
in
the
inner
room
it
grew
late
and
later
hayoue
had
intended
to
make
other
calls
and
zashue
also
became
impatient
to
go
so
he
called
into
the
dark
passage
shotaye
no
reply
shotaye
shotaye
sam
m
all
was
as
silent
as
the
grave
they
sat
in
expectation
for
a
while
then
he
again
shouted
shotaye
sam
m
come
out
nothing
was
heard
he
noisily
removed
the
from
the
entrance
and
cried
shotaye
we
must
go
bring
the
feathers
let
me
alone
and
go
sounded
the
dull
reply
at
last
give
me
the
feathers
first
zashue
demanded
come
and
get
them
yourself
replied
the
voice
inside
this
was
rather
an
awkward
invitation
for
both
men
like
almost
everybody
else
at
the
rito
were
afraid
of
the
private
room
do
bring
them
zashue
begged
go
i
will
not
come
out
any
more
growled
the
voice
within
shotaye
sister
bring
me
the
feathers
i
will
give
you
a
fine
deerskin
for
them
implored
the
husband
of
say
what
do
you
want
them
for
for
the
dance
you
lie
there
is
no
dance
now
anxiously
and
eagerly
zashue
cried
there
will
certainly
be
a
dance
three
days
hence
we
shall
dance
the
ayash
tyucotz
and
hayoue
who
until
then
had
quietly
enjoyed
the
dialogue
now
interjected
emphatically
certainly
sanaya
in
three
days
what
will
you
give
me
if
i
bring
them
came
the
dull
query
again
from
within
a
hide
go
i
will
keep
my
feathers
i
will
give
you
two
turquoises
give
me
four
demanded
the
it
is
too
much
cried
both
men
at
once
no
reply
followed
shotaye
remained
silent
the
trade
was
broken
off
still
the
younger
brother
felt
disinclined
to
give
up
he
went
to
the
mouth
of
the
passage
and
said
aloud
if
you
give
us
the
feathers
you
shall
have
two
green
stones
and
one
deerskin
is
it
true
do
both
of
you
promise
it
asked
the
woman
after
a
while
yes
yes
cried
both
men
together
then
put
the
things
near
the
hearth
and
sit
down
she
commanded
we
have
them
not
with
us
go
and
get
them
we
can
not
then
i
will
keep
my
feathers
until
you
bring
what
you
have
promised
and
with
these
words
shotaye
crept
smiling
out
of
the
passage
and
planted
herself
before
the
discomfited
men
go
home
now
children
she
said
i
am
tired
i
am
sleepy
they
attempted
to
beg
they
pleaded
and
implored
but
she
was
firm
all
they
finally
obtained
was
her
promise
to
deliver
the
feathers
on
the
next
day
provided
the
price
agreed
upon
was
paid
with
this
the
two
men
had
to
be
satisfied
and
their
exit
was
as
crestfallen
and
disappointed
as
their
entrance
had
been
mischievous
and
buoyant
they
had
been
completely
outwitted
and
foiled
by
the
wily
woman
nevertheless
they
never
thought
for
a
moment
of
obtaining
by
force
what
she
so
positively
refused
it
would
have
been
easy
for
the
two
strong
men
to
overpower
her
but
both
were
afraid
of
the
supernatural
powers
attributed
to
shotaye
for
the
same
reason
they
were
anxious
to
obtain
the
feathers
an
object
coming
from
her
and
having
been
in
her
possession
was
suspected
of
having
acquired
thereby
virtues
which
it
did
not
possess
before
but
these
virtues
were
thought
to
be
beneficial
only
as
long
as
the
object
was
obtained
from
her
in
a
legitimate
way
and
with
her
own
free
will
and
kind
consent
in
the
opposite
case
the
bad
will
of
the
woman
went
with
the
feathers
and
was
thought
to
work
harm
to
their
new
owner
it
was
easy
to
taunt
or
to
tease
shotaye
but
to
arouse
her
anger
appeared
a
dangerous
undertaking
and
as
for
harming
her
person
none
but
the
shamans
would
have
attempted
it
after
her
guests
departure
shotaye
felt
wide
awake
she
had
dismissed
them
not
in
order
to
go
to
rest
but
in
order
to
be
once
more
alone
with
her
thoughts
for
during
the
bantering
conversation
with
the
brothers
she
had
learned
several
important
facts
that
changed
materially
her
plans
in
order
to
ponder
carefully
over
the
different
aspect
of
matters
she
poked
the
fire
again
and
sat
down
by
the
hearth
in
the
same
position
as
before
the
interruption
and
mused
in
the
first
place
it
had
become
clear
to
her
that
zashue
was
utterly
ignorant
of
the
accusation
against
his
wife
next
she
was
convinced
that
hayoue
was
far
from
being
tyope
friend
on
the
contrary
he
seemed
to
dislike
him
thoroughly
hayoue
was
known
to
be
very
outspoken
in
matters
of
sympathy
and
antipathy
and
if
he
were
not
fond
of
tyope
the
latter
certainly
had
come
to
feel
it
in
some
way
or
other
then
for
she
knew
tyope
well
he
doubtless
hated
hayoue
cordially
and
would
have
shown
his
enmity
in
the
dark
underhand
way
peculiar
to
himself
if
hayoue
on
the
other
hand
was
not
favourably
inclined
toward
tyope
it
was
quite
certain
that
he
being
cuirana
nursed
feelings
of
dislike
toward
the
koshare
in
general
any
accusation
therefore
which
the
delight
makers
would
bring
against
say
koitza
was
sure
to
meet
at
first
with
decided
incredulity
on
the
part
of
the
young
man
and
this
incredulity
might
possibly
be
converted
through
adroit
management
into
active
opposition
but
the
most
valuable
piece
of
news
she
had
heard
from
the
intruders
was
that
three
days
hence
a
solemn
dance
the
ayash
tyucotz
was
to
be
performed
at
the
rito
these
ceremonies
which
are
always
of
a
religious
nature
are
proposed
generally
by
the
principal
shamans
to
the
civil
chiefs
in
council
or
privately
either
on
the
strength
of
some
presage
or
dream
or
as
a
public
necessity
the
proposal
agreed
to
as
it
usually
is
the
time
is
set
but
no
publication
is
made
either
of
the
performance
or
of
the
hour
until
the
day
on
which
it
is
to
occur
or
the
evening
previous
but
the
matter
is
talked
about
at
home
in
the
circle
of
friends
and
thus
it
gradually
becomes
known
to
everybody
as
a
public
secret
and
everybody
has
time
to
prepare
for
it
shotaye
mixed
very
little
with
the
people
at
the
rito
she
hardly
ever
went
to
see
any
one
and
such
as
came
to
see
her
had
other
matters
to
talk
about
it
was
no
surprise
to
her
to
learn
that
an
important
dance
was
near
at
hand
but
it
was
a
source
of
much
gratification
nevertheless
for
until
the
dance
was
over
nothing
could
or
would
be
undertaken
against
say
and
herself
after
the
performance
it
was
equally
sure
that
several
days
would
elapse
ere
the
council
could
meet
in
full
as
the
religious
heads
of
the
tribe
had
yet
to
go
through
ceremonies
of
a
private
nature
at
all
events
it
proved
to
her
that
there
was
no
immediate
danger
and
that
she
still
had
time
before
her
with
time
so
the
resolute
and
wary
woman
reasoned
there
was
hope
thus
musing
and
speculating
she
sat
for
a
long
while
the
fire
went
out
but
she
did
not
notice
it
at
last
she
arose
unfolded
several
robes
and
mantles
which
she
easily
found
in
the
dark
and
spread
them
out
on
the
floor
for
her
couch
shotaye
could
go
to
sleep
for
at
last
she
saw
or
thought
she
saw
her
way
clearly
she
had
fully
determined
upon
her
plan
of
action
chapter
vi
shrill
cries
succeeding
one
another
in
quick
succession
ending
in
a
prolonged
shout
proceed
from
the
outer
exit
of
the
gallery
that
opens
upon
the
of
the
large
building
the
final
whoop
caught
up
by
the
cliffs
of
the
tyuonyi
echoes
and
a
prolonged
howl
dying
out
in
a
wail
men
voices
hoarse
and
untrained
are
now
heard
chanting
in
rhythmic
and
monotonous
chorus
they
approach
slowly
moving
with
measured
regularity
and
now
strange
figures
begin
to
emerge
from
the
and
as
they
file
into
the
the
chant
grows
louder
and
louder
a
refrain
breaks
clearly
and
distinctly
upon
the
ear
mingled
with
the
discordant
rumblings
of
a
drum
the
fantastic
procession
advances
forming
a
double
column
composed
of
men
and
women
side
by
side
the
former
are
stamping
and
the
latter
tripping
lightly
but
all
are
keeping
time
they
certainly
present
a
weird
appearance
tricked
out
in
their
gaudy
apparel
and
ornamented
with
flashy
trinkets
the
hair
of
the
men
is
worn
loose
tufts
of
green
and
yellow
feathers
flutter
over
the
forehead
while
around
their
necks
and
dangling
over
their
naked
chests
are
seen
strings
of
porcupine
quills
shell
beads
turquoises
bright
pebbles
feldspar
apatite
anything
in
short
that
glitters
and
shines
bunches
of
similar
material
glisten
in
their
ears
fastened
about
the
waist
and
reaching
as
low
as
the
knee
a
rude
garment
composed
of
white
cotton
cloth
or
of
deerskin
hangs
and
flaps
it
is
ornamented
with
an
embroidery
of
red
and
black
threads
and
quills
of
the
porcupine
below
the
knee
garters
of
buckskin
tinged
red
and
yellow
form
a
fringe
to
which
are
attached
rattles
and
bunches
of
the
ankles
are
encased
with
strips
of
the
white
and
black
fur
of
the
skunk
and
from
the
waist
a
hangs
fastened
to
the
back
and
reaching
almost
as
far
as
the
heel
each
man
carries
a
tuft
of
hawk
feathers
in
his
left
hand
while
the
right
grasps
a
rattle
fashioned
from
a
gourd
and
filled
with
pebbles
the
women
wear
their
ordinary
dress
emphasized
however
with
a
profusion
of
necklaces
wristbands
and
ear
pendants
while
in
each
hand
is
borne
a
bunch
of
pine
twigs
wagging
from
side
to
side
as
they
move
but
by
far
the
most
striking
feature
of
their
costume
is
their
headdress
it
consists
of
a
piece
of
scraped
and
flattened
like
a
board
about
fifteen
inches
long
and
seven
inches
wide
one
end
of
which
is
cut
square
the
other
terminates
in
what
resembles
a
triple
turret
squarely
notched
this
is
painted
green
and
decorated
with
symbolic
figures
in
red
and
yellow
white
feathers
flutter
from
each
of
the
three
projections
and
this
peculiar
headgear
is
held
in
place
by
strips
of
buckskin
attached
to
the
squared
end
and
knotted
about
meshes
of
the
dark
streaming
hair
the
faces
of
both
sexes
are
generously
daubed
with
white
clay
in
addition
to
which
the
men
have
their
naked
chests
upper
arms
and
hands
also
decorated
with
stripes
and
blotches
of
the
same
substance
the
procession
is
a
long
one
couple
follows
couple
the
men
gravely
stamping
the
women
gracefully
tripping
at
the
head
are
the
tallest
and
most
robust
youths
the
best
developed
and
most
buxom
girls
following
these
the
dancers
are
less
and
less
carefully
assorted
and
matched
while
boys
and
old
women
little
girls
and
old
men
bring
up
the
rear
as
the
last
couple
emerges
the
chorus
bursts
out
in
full
force
the
choristers
themselves
issuing
from
the
dark
these
are
twelve
in
number
all
men
dressed
or
undressed
as
each
one
fancy
dictates
their
faces
whitened
like
the
dancers
their
rude
chant
or
rhythmic
shouting
is
in
the
minor
key
they
advance
in
a
body
keeping
time
with
their
feet
gesticulating
in
a
manner
intended
to
convey
the
meaning
of
their
song
in
their
midst
goes
the
an
aged
man
adorned
with
an
eagle
feather
behind
each
ear
like
the
rest
his
face
is
daubed
with
white
paint
his
drum
which
he
thumps
incessantly
with
a
single
stick
being
manufactured
from
a
hollow
tree
both
ends
of
it
are
covered
with
rawhide
and
the
whole
instrument
is
painted
yellow
we
recognize
easily
in
this
musician
the
head
of
the
koshare
late
tormentor
at
no
great
distance
from
the
exit
the
chorus
comes
to
a
halt
but
the
singing
gesticulation
and
beating
of
the
drum
proceed
the
dancers
meanwhile
move
about
the
whole
court
to
the
same
step
but
the
couples
separate
and
change
places
man
steps
beside
man
woman
joins
woman
all
turning
and
passing
each
other
suggesting
by
their
movements
the
flexures
of
a
closely
folded
ribbon
the
couples
then
the
double
rank
strings
out
as
at
first
tramping
and
tripping
in
a
wide
circle
to
the
rhythm
and
measure
of
the
monotonous
music
this
solemn
perambulation
and
primitive
concert
is
witnessed
by
numerous
interested
spectators
and
listened
to
by
a
large
and
attentive
audience
the

entire
population
is
assembled
eagerly
at
times
almost
devoutly
gazing
and
listening
the

at

and

the
monotonous

the
dull
thumping
and
drumming
rise
into
the
deep
blue
sky
from
the
towering
cliffs
whose
pinnacles
look
down
upon
the
weird
scene
from
heights
far
above
the
uppermost
tier
of
spectators
among
those
looking
on
we
may
recognize
some
of
our
acquaintances
seated
upon
one
of
the
terraces
his
chin
resting
on
his
hand
is
topanashka
who
looks
down
upon
the
actors
with
a
grave
cold
seemingly
indifferent
gaze
say
koitza
stands
in
the
doorway
of
her
dwelling
her
wan
face
wearing
an
immobile
expression
her
little
girl
elegantly
arrayed
in
a
and
turquoise
necklace
clings
to
her
wrap
with
one
hand
while
the
other
disappears
in
her
gaping
mouth
the
child
is
half
afraid
half
curious
and
has
an
anxious
troubled
look
shyuote
however
evinces
no
sign
of
embarrassment
or
humility
planted
solidly
on
his
feet
with
legs
well
apart
and
both
arms
arched
he
gapes
and
stares
at
everybody
and
everything
occasionally
fixing
his
glance
upon
the
resplendent

overhead
in

the
mass
of
spectators

are
here

and
more
are
coming
constantly

not
content
themselves
with
devout
and
reverent
admiration
criticism
is
going
on
and
it
is
exercised
with
the
most
unlimited
freedom
should
any
one
attract
attention
to
himself
either
by
the
perfection
or
imperfection
of
his
dress
measured
by
the
standard
of
the
critic
he
is
not
only
mentioned
by
name
and
his
garb
audibly
criticised
but
pointed
at
approvingly
or
derisively
the
men
are
made
the
butt
of
their
own
sex
among
the
audience
while
the
women
praise
or
depreciate
according
as
the
occasion
may
seem
to
require
the
female
members
of
the
procession
frequently
when
the
costume
of
some
dusky
beauty
in
the
arena
is
the
object
of
publicly
expressed
admiration
some
other
within
hearing
may
be
seen
casting
a
covert
glance
of
disappointment
at
her
own
less
successful
apparel
or
she
fixes
her
eyes
upon
her
gorgeous
necklace
with
evident
gratification
satisfied
that
her
own
is
handsomer
than
the
one
that
the

so
much
admire

she
soothes
her
injured
vanity
with
haughty
contempt
for
the
taste
of
those
who
see
so
much
in

rival
to
admire
the
beat
of
the
drum
ceases
the
wild
song
is
hushed
and
the
dancers
break
rank
seeking
rest
they
collect
in
groups
or
mingle
with
the
bystanders
chatting
laughing
panting
their
violent
exercise
has
played
sad
havoc
with
the
paint
upon
their
faces
and
bodies
rendering
them
less
fantastic
but
more
ludicrous
the
drummer
occasionally
raps
his
instrument
to
satisfy
himself
that
it
is
in
order
otherwise
there
is
a
lull
of
which
all
avail
themselves
to
take
part
in
the
general
conversation
children
resume
their
sports
in
the
suddenly
loud
peals
of
laughter
are
heard
on
every
side
and
all
eyes
turn
simultaneously
toward
the
whence
are
issuing
half
a
dozen
creatures
they
do
not
walk
into
the
polygon
but
rather
tumble
into
it
running
hopping
stumbling
cutting
capers
like
a
troop
of
clumsy
clowns
when
they
have
reached
the
centre
of
the
open
space
laughter
becomes
louder
and
more
boisterous
all
around
such
expressions
of
mirth
do
not
merely
signify
amusement
but
are
meant
as
demonstrations
of
applause
the
indian
does
not
applaud
by
clapping
his
hands
or
stamping
his
feet
but
evinces
his
approbation
by
laughter
and
smirks
the
appearance
of
the
six
men
who
have
just
tumbled
into
the
arena
is
not
merely
strange
it
is
positively
disgusting
they
are
covered
with
white
paint
and
with
the
exception
of
tattered
are
absolutely
naked
their
mouths
and
eyes
are
encircled
with
black
rings
their
hair
is
gathered
in
knots
upon
the
tops
of
their
heads
from
which
rise
bunches
of
corn
husks
a
string
of
dangles
from
each
wrist
fragments
of
fossil
wood
hang
from
the
loins
and
to
the
knees
are
fastened
nothing
is
worn
with
a
view
to
ornament
these
seeming
monstrosities
frightful
in
their
ugliness
move
about
quite
nimbly
and
are
boldly
impudent
to
a
degree
approaching
sublimity
notwithstanding
their
uncouth
figures
and
mountebank
tricks
their
movements
at
times
are
undoubtedly
graceful
and
they
appear
to
exercise
a
certain
authority
over
the
entire
pageant
white
is
the
symbolic
paint
of
the
koshare
hence
all
the
actors
who
have
performed
their
several
parts
including
the
coarse
jesters
make
up
and
represent
the
society
of
the
delight
makers
whose
office
it
is
to
open
the
ayash
tyucotz
the
association
whose
name
has
been
selected
as
the
title
of
our
story
is
now
before
us
fully
represented
arrayed
in
its
appropriate
dress
and
engaged
in
the
discharge
of
some
of
its
official
duties
the
clowns
too
the
most
agile
and
sprightly
in
a
word
the
most
amusing
of
the
company
are
only
an
exaggeration
of
the
rest
whose
joint
task
it
is
to
diffuse
mirth
joy
buoyancy
delight
throughout
the
whole
tribe
the
jesters
are
also
the
heralds
and
marshals
of
the
celebration
they
gather
together
in
the
centre
of
the
court
and
carry
on
a
boisterous
conversation
accompanied
with
extravagant
gestures
no
one
interrupts
their
noisy
garrulity
but
the
entire
assemblage
listens
eagerly
hailing
their
clumsy
attempts
at
a
joke
and
their
coarse
sallies
of
wit
with
shrieks
of
laughter
their
jests
are
necessarily
of
the
coarsest
nevertheless
excellent
local
hits
are
made
and
satiric
personalities
of
considerable
pungency
are
not
infrequently
indulged
in
one
of
the
clowns
has
tumbled
down
he
lies
on
his
back
feet
in
the
air
another
takes
hold
of
his
legs
and
drags
him
around
in
the
dust
the
peals
of
laughter
that
greet
this
effort
give
testimony
to
the
estimation
in
which
it
is
held
by
the
if
one
of
the
spectators
has
the
misfortune
to
display
immoderate
enthusiasm
forthwith
he
is
made
the
target
of
merciless
jeering
one
of
the
merrymakers
goes
up
to
him
and
mimics
his
manner
and
actions
in
the
crudest
possible
way
the
people
on
the
terraced
roofs
exhibit
their
joy
by
showering
down
from
their
perches
which
the
performers
greedily
devour
these
things
are
delightful
according
to
indian
notions
and
are
well
fitted
to
show
how
much
of
a
child
he
still
is
a
child
however
it
must
be
remembered
endowed
with
the
physical
strength
passions
and
appetites
of
adult
mankind
the
jesters
scatter
one
of
their
number
runs
up
to
say
koitza
who
shrinks
at
his
approach
nevertheless
he
plants
himself
squarely
in
front
of
her
bends
his
knees
sidewise
so
as
to
describe
a
lozenge
with
his
legs
and
thrusts
out
his
tongue
to
its
fullest
possible
extent
upon
this
the
woman
laughs
for
in
the
grimacing
abomination
she
has
discovered
her
own
husband
zashue
who
thus
pleasantly
makes
himself
known
the
hit
is
simply
magnificent
in
the
judgment
of
his
audience
meanwhile
one
of
his
colleagues
is
astride
a
beam
and
endeavouring
to
crawl
up
it
a
third
is
actually
on
the
roof
and
scatters
the
shrieking
girls
everywhere
by
his
impudent
addresses
another
bursts
from
a
room
on
the
holding
ears
of
corn
in
each
hand
and
throwing
himself
upon
the
earth
begins
to
gnaw
them
as
a
dog
would
a
bone
while
one
of
his
companions
leaps
on
him
and
together
they
give
a
faithful
representation
of
two
prairie
wolves
fighting
over
carrion
the
greatest
uproar
prevails
all
about
the
koshare
are
outdoing
themselves
they
scatter
delirious
joy
pleasure
delight
broadcast
among
the
people
the
rumblings
of
the
drum
are
heard
again
the
men
and
women
dancers
take
their
places
once
more
the
chorus
surround
the
musicians
the
clowns
hush
at
once
and
squat
or
lie
down
along
the
walls
sober
and
dignified
the
strange
de
in
four
lines
the
second
and
third
facing
each
other
and
the
first
and
fourth
fronting
in
opposite
directions
men
and
women
alternate
loud
whoops
and
yells
startle
the
air
the
drum
rolls
and
thunders
each
dancer
brandishes
his
rattle
softly
and
gently
at
first
the
chant
begins
gradually
it
increases
in
power
the
dancers
marking
time
livelier
become
the
motions
stronger
and
stronger
the
chanting
its
text
distinct
and
clearly
enunciated
u
shoto
the
dancers
intermingle
those
in
the
front
shift
to
the
rear
rank
then
all
together
utter
a
piercing
shriek
and
dart
back
to
their
former
positions
the
ceremony
continues
for
upward
of
half
an
hour
during
which
the
same
words
are
sung
the
same
figures
repeated
then
there
is
again
a
pause
and
the
actors
disband
to
rest
and
recuperate
the
clowns
forget
their
dignity
and
set
to
work
with
redoubled
energy
growing
bolder
and
bolder
a
party
of
them
has
penetrated
into
a
apartment
and
are
throwing
the
scanty
furniture
through
the
doorway
now
they
spread
robes
and
mats
in
the
open
court
lie
down
on
them
crack
jokes
and
make
faces
at
the
audience
a
specially
gifted
member
of
the
fraternity
hurries
down
a
beam
with
a
baby
in
his
clutches
which
he
has
powdered
with
ashes
he
dances
about
with
it
and
exhibits
the
squalling
brat
in
every
attitude
as
a
potential
koshare
the
people
scream
and
shout
with
unmixed
pleasure
now
they
point
at
a
pair
of
monsters
one
stamping
and
the
other
tripping
daintily
who
effectually
mimic
the
late
partners
of
the
dance
in
the
most
heartless
manner
another
of
these
hideous
creatures
is
sitting
down
his
head
covered
with
a
dirty
rag
staring
stuttering
and
mumbling
like
an
imbecile
his
pantomime
is
recognized
at
once
as
a
cruel
mimicry
of
the
chief
penitent
while
at
prayer
and
it
is
universally
pronounced
to
be
a
superb
performance
to
the
koshare
nothing
is
sacred
all
things
are
permitted
so
long
as
they
contribute
delight
to
the
tribe
topanashka
appeared
to
be
lonesome
in
his
exalted
seat
upon
the
roof
he
arose
quietly
and
the
bystanders
made
room
for
the
tall
man
as
with
eyes
fixed
on
an
opposite
terrace
he
slowly
descended
and
walked
along
the
houses
without
deigning
to
take
any
notice
of
the
gambols
of
the
koshare
he
brushed
past
say
koitza
and
without
looking
at
her
or
moving
a
feature
muttered
so
that
she
alone
could
hear
watch
lest
they
discover
the
feathers
passing
to
the
other
side
of
the
court
he
seated
himself
near
a
small
slender
man
somewhat
younger
than
himself
this
was
the
tapop
or
chief
civil
officer
at
the
rito
the
woman
was
greatly
frightened
by
her
father
words
it
flashed
upon
her
that
should
the
delight
makers
raid
her
household
and
upset
it
as
they
had
others
the
owl
feathers
might
be
detected
in
the
troubled
state
of
her
mind
she
had
failed
to
destroy
or
even
remove
them
nevertheless
she
could
not
immediately
leave
her
post
through
fear
of
awakening
suspicion
she
must
wait
until
the
dance
should
begin
and
the
goblins
become
quiescent
then
what
then
the
feathers
lay
buried
in
the
earthen
floor
of
the
inner
room
their
removal
must
be
accomplished
with
great
care
in
such
a
manner
as
to
leave
no
signs
of
the
earth
having
been
recently
disturbed
there
was
no
choice
they
must
be
removed
at
all
hazards
there
would
be
ample
time
if
she
could
only
afterward
obliterate
all
traces
of
her
work
luckily
the
kitchen
was
very
dark
and
the
hearth
covered
with
ashes
water
was
there
also
but
she
dare
not
use
it
lest
the
moistened
spot
betray
her
her
mind
was
made
up
however
and
the
attempt
would
be
made
as
soon
as
the
dance
was
renewed
singing
and
drumming
are
heard
once
more
the
dancers
fall
into
line
and
when
the
chorus
was
shouting
the
second
verse
u
and
the
jokers
had
dispersed
say
slowly
retreated
within
the
room
cowered
down
by
the
hearth
a
sharp
in
her
hand
and
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
door
watching
lest
anybody
should
appear
she
listened
with
throbbing
heart
to
discover
whether
there
was
any
shuffling
sound
to
betray
the
approach
of
one
of
the
koshare
she
saw
nothing
and
no
sound
was
heard
except
the
beats
of
the
drum
and
the
monotonous
rhythm
the
woman
began
to
dig
she
dug
with
feverish
haste
the
dance
lacked
interest
for
her
time
and
again
had
she
witnessed
it
and
well
knew
the
figures
now
being
performed
she
made
the
hole
as
small
as
possible
digging
and
digging
anxiously
listening
eagerly
looking
up
now
and
then
at
the
doorway
and
starting
timidly
at
the
least
sound
at
last
her
instrument
struck
a
resisting
though
elastic
object
it
was
the
feathers
cautiously
she
pulled
pulled
them
up
until
she
had
drawn
them
to
the
top
of
the
hole
then
peered
about
her
intently
listening
nothing
outside
the
uproar
went
on
the
chorus
shouting
at
the
top
of
their
voices
wrenching
the
bundle
from
its
she
concealed
it
in
her
bosom
then
carefully
replaced
the
earth
and
clay
put
ashes
on
this
then
clay
rubbed
the
latter
with
a
stone
threw
on
more
ashes
and
more
clay
and
finally
stamped
this
with
her
feet
all
the
while
listening
and
glancing
into
the
outer
room
at
last
when
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
most
rigid
search
could
detect
no
trace
of
her
labours
she
brushed
the
ashes
from
her
wrap
and
went
out
under
the
doorway
again
she
appeared
composed
and
more
cheerful
but
her
heart
was
palpitating
terribly
and
at
every
pulsation
she
felt
the
dangerous
bundle
concealed
beneath
her
clothing
and
she
tightened
still
more
the
belt
encircling
her
waist
the
third
act
of
the
dance
soon
ended
and
the
jesters
went
to
work
once
more
women
and
girls
now
became
the
objects
of
their
attentions
the
screams
and
shrieks
from
the
roof
terraces
when
a
koshare
is
tearing
about
amongst
the
women
loud
as
they
are
are
drowned
by
the
uproarious
laughter
of
the
men
who
enjoy
hugely
the
disgust
and
terror
of
the
other
sex
from
some
of
the
houses
the
white
painted
horrors
have
taken
out
the
kneeling
behind
them
they
heap
dirt
on
their
flat
surfaces
moisten
it
with
water
and
grind
the
mud
as
the
housewife
does
the
corn
yelping
and
wailing
the
while
in
mimicry
of
the
woman
and
her
song
while
similarly
engaged
the
pranks
of
these
fellows
are
simply
silly
and
ugly
the
folly
borders
on
imbecility
and
the
ugliness
is
disgusting
and
yet
nobody
is
shocked
everybody
endures
it
and
laughs
illustration
the
dance
of
the
ayash
tyucotz
say
koitza
herself
enjoyed
seeing
her
sex
made
a
butt
by
coarse
and
vulgar
satyrs
suddenly
two
of
the
beasts
stand
before
her
and
one
of
them
attempts
an
embrace
with
a
loud
shriek
she
pushes
him
away
steps
nimbly
aside
and
so
saves
the
treacherous
bundle
from
his
grasp
both
the
monsters
storm
into
the
house
where
a
terrific
uproar
begins
corn
is
thrown
about
are
disturbed
pots
and
bowls
robes
and
mats
are
dragged
hither
and
thither
they
thump
scratch
and
pound
every
corner
of
her
little
house
gasping
for
breath
quaking
from
terror
and
distress
she
leans
against
the
wall
for
in
the
fellow
who
sought
to
embrace
her
she
recognizes
tyope
all
at
once
he
darts
out
of
the
house
rushing
past
her
with
a
large
ear
of
corn
in
each
hand
which
he
forthwith
hurls
at
the
head
of
one
of
his
comrades
this
provokes
intense
merriment
increased
still
more
by
his
lying
down
and
rolling
over
several
times
the
climax
of
his
humour
is
attained
and
exhibits
itself
in
his
squatting
on
the
ground
close
to
one
of
the
artists
where
he
begins
to
feed
very
eagerly
upon
the
liquid
mud
literally
eating
dirt
but
a
terrible
weight
has
been
lifted
from
the
breast
of
the
poor
woman
for
the
dangerous
man
has
so
she
must
conclude
from
his
actions
discovered
nothing
meanwhile
the
other
koshare
had
stepped
out
of
the
house
with
hands
say
is
unconscious
of
his
approach
and
as
he
passes
her
he
empties
his
treasures
fine
ashes
upon
her
devoted
head
so
sudden
is
his
disappearance
and
so
loud
the
laughter
which
this
display
of
subtle
humour
excites
among
the
bystanders
that
say
koitza
fails
to
recognize
its
author
zashue
her
own
husband
she
feels
much
relieved
and
her
heart
has
grown
light
now
that
the
immediate
danger
is
past
and
intently
she
tries
to
catch
her
eye
but
the
old
man
is
quietly
seated
and
does
not
look
toward
her
the
drum
beats
to
signal
the
close
of
the
intermission
the
clowns
are
becoming
too
impudent
too
troublesome
so
that
an
end
must
be
made
to
their
pranks
the
society
of
the
koshare
will
appear
now
for
the
last
time
as
after
the
next
dance
they
retire
while
this
is
at
its
height
topanashka
rises
and
returns
to
his
former
place
walking
slowly
past
his
daughter
he
looks
at
her
she
meets
his
gaze
cheerfully
and
with
a
slight
nod
of
approbation
he
moves
onward
the
dance
is
over
and
the
koshare
depart
to
scatter
beyond
the
large
house
and
to
rest
on
the
disappearance
of
the
last
of
their
number
including
the
jesters
whoops
and
shouts
fill
the
air
again
from
without
and
a
second
procession
similar
to
the
former
marches
into
the
it
is
composed
of
different
persons
similarly
costumed
except
that
their
paint
is
bluish
instead
of
white
no
clowns
accompany
them
they
go
through
a
similar
performance
and
sing
the
same
songs
but
everything
is
done
with
gravity
and
even
solemnity
this
band
is
more
numerous
by
at
least
ten
couples
and
as
a
consequence
the
spectacle
is
more
striking
on
account
of
a
greater
variety
of
dress
and
finery
a
tall
slender
young
man
opens
the
march
it
is
hayoue
his
partner
is
a
buxom
lass
from
the
bear
clan
kohayo
hanutsh
a
strong
creature
not
so
for
a
girl
as
he
is
for
a
man
yet
of
such
proportion
and
figure
as
strike
the
indian
fancy
they
pay
each
other
little
attention
during
the
pauses
each
one
follows
his
own
bent
and
when
the
time
calls
they
meet
again
in
an
indian
dance
there
is
no
need
of
engaging
partners
though
it
is
not
unusual
for
such
as
fancy
one
another
to
seize
the
opportunity
of
so
doing
the
mere
fact
of
a
certain
boy
stamping
the
earth
beside
a
certain
girl
on
a
certain
occasion
or
a
certain
maiden
tripping
by
the
side
of
a
particular
youth
does
not
call
for
that
active
gossiping
which
would
result
if
a
couple
were
to
dance
with
one
another
alone
at
one
of
our
balls
a
civilized
ball
is
professedly
for
enjoyment
alone
an
indian
dance
is
a
religious
act
a
public
duty
the
society
who
are
now
exercising
their
calisthenics
in
the
court
has
much
similarity
to
the
koshare
yet
their
main
functions
are
distinct
they
are
called
the
cuirana
if
during
the
conversation
in
which
topanashka
informed
his
daughter
as
to
the
origin
of
the
koshare
and
the
ideas
underlying
their
rôle
in
indian
society
say
koitza
had
inquired
of
him
about
the
cuirana
he
might
have
given
her
very
similar
information
with
this
marked
distinction
however
that
whereas
the
former
consider
themselves
summer
people
the
latter
are
regarded
as
winter
men
while
the
koshare
are
specially
charged
with
the
duty
of
furthering
the
ripening
of
the
fruit
the
cuirana
assist
the
sprouting
of
the
seed
the
main
work
of
the
koshare
is
therefore
to
be
done
in
the
summer
and
autumn
that
of
the
cuirana
in
the
spring
and
moreover
while
on
certain
occasions
the
latter
are
masters
of
ceremonies
also
they
never
act
as
clowns
or
official
jesters
their
special
dance
is
never
obscene
like
that
of
the
delight
makers
during
their
performance
therefore
the
public
did
not
exhibit
the
unbounded
hilarity
which
marked
that
of
their
predecessors
the
audience
looked
on
quietly
and
even
with
stolidity
there
was
nothing
to
excite
laughter
and
since
the
figures
were
slavish
repetitions
it
became
monotonous
some
of
the
spectators
withdrew
to
their
houses
and
those
who
remained
belonged
to
the
cliffs
whence
they
had
come
to
witness
the
rite
as
a
serious
and
even
sacred
duty
while
the
dance
of
the
cuirana
is
in
progress
two
of
the
white
painted
clowns
are
standing
outside
of
the
big
building
and
at
some
distance
from
the
new
house
of
yakka
hanutsh
in
earnest
conversation
heat
and
exercise
have
partially
effaced
the
paint
so
that
the
features
of
tyope
tihua
and
of
zashue
the
husband
of
say
can
be
easily
recognized
i
tell
you
satyumishe
asserts
the
latter
you
are
mistaken
or
words
have
been
spoken
to
you
that
are
not
true
this
wife
of
mine
is
good
she
has
nothing
to
do
with
evil
nor
has
she
tampered
with
it
you
have
done
her
wrong
tyope
and
that
is
not
right
his
features
already
distorted
by
the
paint
took
on
an
expression
of
anger
the
other
responded
hastily
and
i
tell
you
zashue
tihua
that
i
saw
your
wife
sitting
by
the
hearth
with
shotaye
his
voice
trembled
at
the
mention
of
her
name
and
i
heard
when
that
mean
low
aniehna
his
eyes
flashed
giving
a
terrible
expression
to
his
already
monstrously
disfigured
countenance
spoke
to
the
yellow
corn
did
you
understand
what
she
said
zashue
interjected
no
but
can
any
one
ask
aught
of
the
yellow
corn
but
evil
i
know
too
that
this
shuatyam
picked
up
the
body
of
an
owl
on
the
mesa
he
pointed
to
the
southern
heights
and
carried
its
feathers
back
to
her
foul
hole
in
the
rocks
but
you
did
not
see
say
with
them
her
husband
looked
in
the
eyes
of
the
other
inquiringly
and
at
the
same
time
threateningly
that
is
the
truth
but
why
does
she
go
with
the
witch
and
for
what
purpose
does
that
female
skunk
need
owl
plumage
if
not
to
harm
the
tribe
she
has
done
harm
too
he
stamped
his
foot
angrily
she
is
the
cause
of
our
having
no
rain
last
summer
she
destroyed
the
ere
it
could
bring
forth
ears
she
did
it
and
your
wife
helped
her
furious
and
with
flaming
eyes
tyope
turned
his
head
and
stared
into
space
are
you
sure
that
shotaye
has
done
this
and
that
it
is
not
p
yatyama
will
did
we
not
fast
and
mortify
ourselves
while
it
was
yet
time
all
of
us
from
the
hotshanyi
down
to
the
youngest
koshare
exclaimed
tyope
was
it
of
any
use
no
for
that
base
woman
had
power
over
us
in
order
to
destroy
the
tribe
i
am
not
defending
her
zashue
muttered
but
it
is
not
certain
that
she
is
guilty
nor
is
it
proven
that
she
is
the
cause
of
the
hunger
we
suffered
last
winter
his
companion
threw
at
him
a
glance
of
intense
rage
the
incredulity
exasperated
tyope
but
he
suppressed
his
feeling
and
spoke
in
a
quieter
tone
come
satyumishe
the
naua
is
expecting
us
and
in
his
presence
we
shall
speak
further
our
father
is
wise
and
will
teach
our
hearts
say
koitza
husband
stood
motionless
looking
away
from
his
friend
come
tyope
urged
placing
his
hand
on
the
other
shoulder
zashue
at
last
turned
around
and
reluctantly
followed
him
both
went
toward
the
new
estufa
of
the
maize
clan
from
this
circular
building
faint
sounds
as
of
a
drum
beaten
by
a
weak
or
lazy
hand
were
issuing
the
principal
koshare
and
the
naua
had
retired
thither
for
recuperation
after
the
dance
although
the
old
man
was
not
of
the
cluster
to
whom
the
estufa
belonged
he
had
obtained
permission
from
yakka
hanutsh
to
use
the
room
on
this
occasion
as
a
meeting
and
dressing
place
for
himself
and
his
associates
the
of
the
corn
people
thus
served
a
twofold
purpose
and
was
used
by
two
distinct
groups
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
rito
at
this
hour
the
koshare
naua
was
its
sole
occupant
he
sat
on
the
floor
holding
the
drum
in
his
lap
and
touching
the
instrument
lightly
from
time
to
time
his
vacant
gaze
was
fixed
upon
a
small
heap
of
dying
embers
nearly
in
the
centre
of
the
room
and
beneath
the
hatchway
occasionally
he
raised
his
head
to
glance
at
the
wall
opposite
him
the
interior
of
the
estufa
appeared
quite
different
from
what
it
did
on
the
day
when
shyuote
peep
into
it
was
so
poorly
rewarded
its
walls
had
been
whitened
and
were
in
addition
covered
with
paintings
the
floor
was
partly
occupied
by
a
remarkable
display
of
equally
strange
objects
the
painting
in
front
of
which
the
old
man
sat
and
at
which
he
gazed
from
time
to
time
represented
in
the
first
place
a
green
disk
surrounded
by
short
red
rays
which
three
white
squares
bordered
with
black
converted
into
something
like
the
rude
semblance
of
a
human
face
this
disk
stood
for
a
picture
of
the
sun
below
it
was
the
symbol
of
the
moon
white
disk
encircled
by
a
black
and
red
ring
and
provided
also
with
square
eyes
and
mouth
still
lower
were
painted
two
crosses
a
red
one
and
a
white
one
both
with
black
border
above
the
sun
there
appeared
a
form
intended
to
be
human
painted
in
very
gaudy
colours
this
was
p
yatyama
the
on
each
side
of
him
rose
a
terraced
pyramid
painted
green
and
from
the
top
of
one
of
these
pyramids
to
that
of
the
other
there
spanned
or
stretched
a
arch
red
yellow
and
blue
over
the
head
on
each
side
of
sun
and
moon
was
the
crudely
executed
picture
of
an
animal
the
one
on
the
right
being
intended
for
a
bear
painted
green
the
one
on
the
left
for
a
panther
painted
red
the
heads
of
these
beasts
were
turned
toward
the
central
figures
still
farther
beyond
these
beasts
of
prey
two
gigantic
green
serpents
with
horned
heads
swept
over
the
remainder
of
the
wall
leaving
but
a
narrow
space
facing
the
sun
where
four
two
green
ones
and
two
of
a
hue
were
painted
below
the
central
figures
and
not
quite
reaching
up
to
them
an
arch
of
wood
painted
green
with
a
yellow
middle
stripe
was
held
aloft
by
two
poles
driven
into
the
floor
of
the
estufa
under
this
arch
stood
a
wooden
screen
green
and
black
with
a
yellow
border
at
the
bottom
while
the
upper
edge
was
carved
into
four
terraced
pyramids
surmounted
by
as
many
black
arches
both
right
and
left
of
the
screen
resembling
of
were
stuck
into
the
floor
this
strange
decoration
expresses
symbolically
a
meaning
similar
to
that
intended
to
be
conveyed
by
the
dance
of
the
ayash
tyucotz
the
soaring
above
the
sun
moon
and
stars
for
the
red
cross
is
the
star
of
morning
the
white
the
evening
star
is
surrounded
by
the
symbols
of
the
principal
phenomena
in
nature
that
are
regarded
as
essentially
beneficent
to
mankind
thus
the
terraced
pyramids
are
the
clouds
for
the
clouds
appear
to
the
indian
as
staircases
leading
to
heaven
and
they
in
turn
support
the
rainbow
the
two
principal
beasts
of
prey
who
feed
upon
game
like
man
and
whose
strength
agility
and
acute
senses
man
hopes
to
acquire
are
represented
as
the
bear
in
the
colour
symbolic
of
the
east
and
the
panther
in
that
of
the
south
farther
away
from
the
are
the
two
monstrous
genii
of
the
and
the
stands
surrounded
by
all
these
elements
and
beings
he
fixes
his
blissful
magic
gaze
upon
the
nourishing
that
they
may
grow
and
that
their
ripe
fruit
may
sustain
the
tribe
thus
much
for
the
allegory
on
the
wall
but
in
order
that
the
wish
and
hope
which
this
allegoric
painting
expresses
on
the
part
of
man
may
become
realized
invocation
rises
before
the
picture
in
the
shape
of
the
screen
denoting
an
altar
on
which
the
rainbow
has
again
settled
down
as
a
messenger
from
above
both
are
green
since
it
is
summer
and
the
summer
sun
or
summer
home
of
the
is
green
also
like
the
earth
covered
with
luxuriant
vegetation
invocation
alone
does
not
suffice
to
incline
the
hearts
of
those
above
kindly
toward
mankind
gratitude
is
required
as
an
earnest
of
sincere
worship
but
this
gratitude
can
be
expressed
by
words
as
well
as
by
deeds
and
prayers
must
precede
accompany
or
follow
the
offering
in
front
of
the
altar
a
row
of
bunches
artistically
composed
of
down
are
placed
on
the
floor
each
of
these
delicate
fabrics
has
sacred
meal
scattered
about
its
base
and
each
of
them
symbolizes
the
soul
of
one
household
they
are
what
the
queres
indian
calls
the
or
mother
dedicated
to
the
who
specially
protects
every
indian
home
all
these
stand
below
the
altar
in
token
of
the
many
prayers
that
each
household
sends
up
to
the
moon
painted
above
that
the
mother
of
all
who
dwells
in
the
silvery
orb
may
thank
her
husband
in
the
sun
for
all
the
good
received
and
implore
him
to
further
shed
his
blessings
on
their
children
between
these
and
the
embers
a
great
number
of
other
objects
are
placed
fetiches
of
stone
animal
figures
sacrificial
bowls
painted
with
symbolic
devices
and
surmounted
by
terraced
prongs
and
wooden
images
of
household
gods
decorated
with
feathers
sacred
meal
is
in
or
about
all
of
them
and
all
stand
for
so
many
intercessors
praying
for
the
good
of
the
people
giving
thanks
in
the
name
of
the
people
and
offering
their
vows
in
token
of
gratitude
similar
to
this
estufa
of
the
corn
clan
are
all
the
other
estufas
on
the
tyuonyi
they
contain
similar
pictures
and
similar
objects
are
grouped
on
the
floors
in
front
of
them
before
the
altars
the
glisten
and
flutter
the
estufas
are
without
human
occupants
their
entrances
alone
are
watched
by
old
men
or
women
outside
to
prevent
the
work
of
invocation
and
gratitude
performed
inside
by
symbolic
advocates
from
being
desecrated
by
rude
or
thoughtless
intruders
while
this
work
is
going
on
thus
silently
and
without
direct
intervention
of
man
man
himself
performs
a
similar
duty
in
the
open
air
through
the
ceremonies
of
the
great
dance
in
this
dance
the
koshare
came
first
for
their
request
was
one
of
immediate
importance
that
the
fruit
may
ripen
is
the
object
of
their
sacramental
performances
even
the
fruit
in
woman
womb
topanashka
had
explained
to
this
end
man
must
contribute
with
delight
and
work
with
love
whoever
mourns
or
harbours
can
not
expect
his
task
to
prosper
in
this
manner
even
the
obscene
performances
of
the
koshare
are
symbolic
and
their
part
in
the
great
dance
is
above
all
an
invocation
next
the
cuirana
came
their
labours
are
over
the
germs
which
they
were
to
protect
with
incantations
have
sprouted
long
ago
and
the
plants
are
ready
for
maturing
for
these
results
of
their
work
they
give
thanks
to
the
thanks
loud
and
emphatic
so
that
he
may
hear
and
see
how
grateful
his
children
are
their
performance
is
a
testimonial
of
gratitude
to
close
the
dance
both
societies
will
finally
appear
together
and
with
them
representatives
of
the
tribe
at
large
all
together
they
will
go
through
the
same
succession
of
ceremonies
in
token
that
all
acquiesce
in
the
sentiments
of
the
koshare
and
the
cuirana
that
each
individual
for
himself
and
in
behalf
of
all
the
others
joins
in
giving
thanks
for
the
past
and
praying
for
the
future
this
is
the
signification
of
the
ayash
tyucotz
when
performed
about
the
time
of
the
summer
solstice
however
clumsy
and
meaningless
it
may
seem
it
is
still
a
solemn
performance
it
gives
public
expression
under
very
strange
forms
to
the
idea
that
has
found
its
most
perfect
utterance
in
the
german
philosopher
definition
of
abject
reliance
upon
god
whereas
in
its
lowest
form
it
is
still
a
vague
and
awful
feeling
about
unity
in
the
powers
of
nature
an
unconscious
acknowledgment
of
the
mysterious
link
connecting
the
material
world
with
a
realm
beyond
it
seated
comfortably
and
alone
surrounded
by
the
symbols
of
his
creed
the
old
leader
of
the
koshare
was
tapping
his
drum
and
humming
softly
a
prayer
on
a
sudden
the
hatchway
above
him
became
darkened
and
as
he
looked
up
he
saw
the
legs
of
a
man
appearing
on
the
uppermost
rounds
of
the
ladder
leading
down
into
the
subterranean
chamber
as
that
man
continued
to
descend
the
body
and
finally
the
head
of
tyope
appeared
then
followed
zashue
tihua
when
both
men
were
below
they
went
to
the
nearest
sacrificial
bowl
each
one
took
from
it
a
pinch
of
yellow
cornmeal
and
scattered
it
in
front
of
the
altar
then
they
turned
to
the
old
man
but
he
did
not
take
any
notice
of
either
of
them
tyope
squatted
by
his
side
while
zashue
remained
erect
sa
nashtio
began
the
former
we
have
not
found
anything
there
is
nothing
added
zashue
rather
excitedly
my
wife
is
innocent
the
naua
raised
his
eyes
with
an
expression
of
astonishment
and
surprise
as
if
failing
to
understand
what
is
it
that
you
have
not
found
he
asked
rather
dreamily
no
coco
tyope
stopped
and
looked
at
the
pictures
on
the
wall
it
is
improper
to
mention
the
names
of
evil
powers
or
agencies
in
presence
of
the
symbols
of
those
above
so
he
corrected
himself
and
said
no
hapi
hapi
the
naua
inquired
with
a
vacant
stare
what
sort
of
hapi
where
did
you
look
for

he
bent
his
head
as
if
trying
to
remember
hapi
exclaimed
tyope
in
the
house
of
say
koitza
this
mot
wife
and
he
pointed
at
his
companion
yes
indeed
the
chief
of
the
koshare
now
recollected
i
know
i
recollect
well
his
eyes
suddenly
brightened
they
assumed
an
expression
of
cunning
as
well
as
of
suspicion
his
quick
glance
moved
back
and
forth
from
one
of
his
visitors
to
the
other
so
you
found
nothing
then
there
is
nothing
you
were
right
zashue
your
wife
is
good
he
gave
a
chuckle
which
he
intended
for
a
benevolent
smile
see
say
husband
exclaimed
turning
to
tyope
the
naua
believes
as
i
do
my
wife
is
no
the
evil
word
he
suppressed
in
time
he
stopped
biting
his
lips
in
embarrassment
tyope
features
moved
not
he
spoke
to
the
chief
of
the
delight
makers
as
quietly
and
calmly
as
possible
i
believe
as
you
do
nashtio
but
while
say
may
be
guiltless
shotaye
is
not
hush
the
naua
sternly
interrupted
think
of
those
here
he
pointed
toward
the
symbols
do
you
know
that
they
must
not
hear
the
name
of
that
woman
tyope
replied
hastily
and
eager
to
drown
the
reprimand
his
chief
had
given
him
what
shall
we
do
naua
the
old
man
became
impatient
do
you
see
that
i
am
at
work
i
am
busy
those
here
he
again
nodded
at
the
idols
leave
me
no
peace
i
must
be
with
them
until
the
last
otshanyi
begins
in
three
days
we
go
to
the
kaaptsh
you
he
all
our
brethren
and
then
we
may
speak
now
leave
me
alone
go
leave
me
go
go
he
cried
and
waved
his
hand
upward
he
was
not
to
be
spoken
to
any
longer
he
began
to
beat
his
drum
and
took
up
the
low
chant
again
zashue
hurriedly
climbed
out
of
the
estufa
and
tyope
followed
with
an
angry
face
when
the
latter
was
on
the
open
ground
again
zashue
stepped
up
to
him
and
said
in
a
very
decided
tone
you
see
now
satyumishe
that
say
is
innocent
hereafter
tyope
leave
her
alone
turning
about
he
walked
toward
the
large
house
tyope
cast
after
him
a
look
less
of
anger
than
of
bitter
disappointment
the
last
act
of
the
great
ceremony
began
a
tremendous
shout
sounded
from
the
outer
entrance
to
the
gallery
leading
into
the
of
the
great
house
the
chant
arose
stronger
and
louder
than
ever
before
and
several
drums
rumbled
at
once
again
were
the
terraces
filled
with
people
the
walls
below
lined
with
spectators
topanashka
sat
on
the
roof
cold
and
impassable
say
koitza
leaned
in
the
doorway
of
her
home
with
a
quiet
almost
smiling
countenance
a
long
array
of
couples
dressed
as
before
but
painted
red
opened
the
procession
then
came
the
cuirana
and
last
the
koshare
topanashka
arose
and
joined
the
dancers
the
tapop
stood
beside
him
and
both
stamped
along
keeping
time
as
if
they
were
young
once
more
the
singers
were
reinforced
by
several
aged
men
with
hair
three
of
whom
wore
dark
wraps
sleeveless
and
covered
with
red
embroidery
these
were
the
chief
penitents
those
without
badges
or
distinctive
dress
the
principal
shamans
of
the
tribe
a
thrill
of
excitement
ran
through
the
spectators
children
on
the
roofs
gathered
in
groups
moving
in
harmony
with
the
strong
rhythmic
noise
below
the
jesters
had
become
very
quiet
they
went
about
gravely
keeping
order
for
the
court
was
now
filled
with
performers
the
green
headdresses
waved
like
reeds
before
the
wind
and
the
whole
space
looked
like
a
rhythmically
wafted
cornfield
when
the
dancers
were
executing
the
beautiful
figure
of
the
planting
of
maize
man
and
woman
bending
outward
simultaneously
each
one
to
his
side
and
all
the
rattles
sounding
as
if
upon
command
everything
around
was
hushed
everybody
looked
on
in
respectful
silence
so
correct
were
the
motions
so
and
so
impressive
the
sight
say
also
felt
genuine
delight
she
thought
of
times
long
past
when
she
too
had
joined
in
the
dance
now
alas
she
could
not
with
all
the
relief
this
day
had
brought
her
there
still
remained
a
dull
weight
in
her
bosom
and
an
inner
voice
forbade
her
to
mingle
with
those
so
sincerely
engaged
in
rites
of
thanksgiving
to
the
powers
of
good
and
happiness
while
she
stood
and
gazed
around
her
attention
was
directed
to
a
young
couple
passing
in
front
of
her
the
handsome
lad
with
the
dark
streaming
hair
was
okoya
and
she
recognized
him
proudly
as
the
youth
on
the
ground
hayoue
perhaps
excepted
but
then
was
not
hayoue
okoya
father
brother
but
who
was
the
girl
by
side
that
slender
figure
of
medium
height
that
earnest
thoughtful
expression
of
the
face
those
lustrous
eyes
whose
were
they
the
two
were
manifestly
a
handsome
pair
and
the
longer
she
watched
them
the
more
she
became
satisfied
that
they
were
the
prettiest
couple
in
the
dance
they
were
certainly
well
matched
her
son
partner
was
the
handsomest
girl
of
the
tribe
of
this
she
was
convinced
and
she
felt
proud
of
it
motherly
pride
caused
her
heart
to
flutter
and
the
instinct
of
woman
made
her
eager
to
know
who
the
maiden
was
who
appeared
such
a
fitting
partner
for
her
own
son
say
koitza
determined
to
improve
the
first
opportunity
that
might
present
itself
for
ascertaining
who
the
girl
was
and
where
she
belonged
the
day
was
drawing
to
a
close
a
day
of
joyful
excitement
for
the
people
of
the
tyuonyi
the
dance
terminated
as
the
sun
went
down
the
dancers
crowded
out
of
the
so
did
the
visitors
it
grew
quieter
and
quieter
on
and
about
the
large
house
the
swarm
of
people
leaving
it
scattered
toward
the
cliffs
in
little
bands
and
thin
streams
separating
and
diverging
from
each
other
like
the
branches
of
an
open
fan
and
yet
after
night
had
come
and
the
moon
had
risen
in
a
cloudless
sky
there
was
still
bustle
everywhere
households
ravaged
by
the
visitations
of
the
koshare
were
being
restored
to
order
the
exhausted
dancers
were
being
feasted
and
the
estufas
were
being
cleared
of
everything
bearing
a
sacred
character
young
men
and
boys
still
loitered
in
groups
repeating
with
hoarse
voices
the
songs
and
chants
they
had
lately
addressed
to
the
ruler
of
day
on
the
terrace
roof
of
the
home
of
tyope
wife
a
young
girl
stood
quite
alone
gazing
at
that
moon
where
the
mother
of
all
mankind
the
sanatyaya
is
supposed
to
reside
it
was
mitsha
koitza
who
had
just
returned
from
the
estufa
of
her
clan
with
the
of
her
own
home
and
who
still
lingered
here
holding
in
her
hands
the
cluster
of
snowy
delicate
feathers
she
thinks
while
her
nimble
fingers
play
with
it
of
the
young
man
who
has
been
her
partner
the
whole
day
who
has
danced
beside
her
so
quiet
modest
and
yet
so
handsome
and
who
once
appeared
to
her
on
this
same
roof
brave
and
resolute
in
her
defence
while
she
thus
stands
gazes
and
dreams
a
flake
of
down
becomes
detached
and
quivers
upward
into
the
calm
still
air
involuntarily
the
maiden
fastens
her
glance
on
the
plumelet
which
flits
upward
and
upward
in
the
direction
of
the
moon
silvery
orb
such
a
flitting
and
floating
plume
is
the
symbol
of
prayer
mitsha
whole
heart
goes
anxiously
with
the
feather
it
rises
and
rises
and
at
last
disappears
as
if
absorbed
by
moonlight
the
features
of
the
maiden
which
till
now
have
carried
an
anxious
pleading
look
brighten
with
a
soft
and
happy
smile
the
mother
above
has
listened
to
her
entreaty
for
the
symbol
of
her
thoughts
the
feather
has
gone
to
rest
on
the
bosom
of
her
who
watches
over
every
house
who
feels
with
every
loving
and
praying
heart
footnotes
footnote
it
was
natural
for
her
to
think
of
removing
the
feathers
as
they
would
in
all
probability
be
looked
for
just
where
she
had
put
them
that
is
under
the
floor
such
was
the
case
at
nambé
in
march
when
owl
feathers
were
found
buried
at
several
places
in
the
pueblo
the
result
of
the
discovery
at
nambé
was
the
slaughter
of
three
men
and
one
woman
for
alleged
witchcraft
by
the
infuriated

prompt
and
energetic
relief
among
the
younger
men
it
was
not
rare
for
some
to
remain
in
company
with
the
fair
sex
until
the
small
hours
of
morning
in
which
case
the
rising
sun
found
them
somewhat
out
of
sleep
but
the
majority
were
glad
to
retire
to
their
habitual
quarters
for
a
good
rest
after
the
day
exertions
and
these
woke
up
the
following
morning
bright
and
active
as
if
nothing
had
happened
to
divert
them
from
the
duties
and
occupations
of
life
to
this
majority
belonged
okoya
after
the
dance
was
over
he
had
loitered
and
lounged
about
for
a
time
with
some
companions
of
his
own
age
but
as
soon
as
the
moon
rose
he
had
sauntered
home
his
mother
was
busy
putting
things
into
shape
for
the
delight
makers
had
left
behind
a
fearful
disorder
shyuote
was
there
too
he
was
careful
not
to
assist
his
mother
but
to
stand
in
her
way
as
much
as
possible
which
action
on
his
part
called
forth
some
very
active
scolding
but
it
struck
okoya
that
she
appeared
more
cheerful
than
before
her
motions
were
brisker
her
step
more
elastic
say
koitza
placed
the
usual
food
before
her
eldest
son
and
at
this
moment
zashue
came
in
also
he
felt
exceedingly
proud
of
his
exploits
as
a
jester
and
was
jollier
than
ever
before
okoya
listened
for
a
while
to
the
clumsy
and
not
always
chaste
jokes
of
his
parent
and
then
retired
to
the
estufa
the
next
morning
bright
and
refreshed
he
strolled
back
to
the
house
for
breakfast
expecting
to
meet
his
father
who
would
assign
him
his
day
work
zashue
had
gone
already
nobody
asked
where
but
it
was
taken
for
granted
that
he
had
gone
to
see
the
old
chief
of
the
delight
makers
about
the
approaching
days
of
penitential
retirement
his
mother
was
up
and
she
addressed
her
son
in
a
pleasant
manner
set
food
before
him
and
then
inquired
sa
uishe
who
was
the
girl
that
danced
by
your
side
it
was
mitsha
koitza
okoya
replied
without
looking
up
mitsha
koitza
she
repeated
where
does
she
belong
tyame
hanutsh
who
is
her
father
tyope
tihua
do
you
like
her
and
he
looked
at
his
mother
pleadingly
as
if
asking
her
forgiveness
and
her
consent
to
his
choice
the
woman
brow
clouded
at
the
mention
of
a
name
so
hateful
to
her
she
looked
hard
at
her
son
and
said
in
a
tone
of
bitter
reproach
and
you
go
with
that
girl
why
not
his
face
darkened
also
have
i
not
told
you
what
kind
of
man
tyope
is
the
girl
is
no
koshare
he
answered
evasively
but
her
mother
is
and
he
both
became
silent
okoya
stared
before
him
his
appetite
was
gone
he
was
angry
and
could
not
eat
any
more
what
right
had
this
woman
although
she
was
his
mother
to
reprove
him
because
he
was
fond
of
a
girl
whose
father
she
did
not
like
was
the
girl
responsible
for
the
deeds
of
her
parents
no
so
he
reasoned
at
once
and
then
his
temper
overcame
him
how
could
his
mother
dare
to
speak
one
single
word
against
the
koshare
had
she
not
betrayed
him
to
them
in
his
thoughts
the
hatred
which
she
pretended
to
display
against
the
koshare
appeared
no
longer
sincere
it
seemed
to
him
hypocrisy
duplicity
deception
such
deceit
could
mean
only
the
darkest
the
most
dangerous
designs
with
the
indian
the
superlative
of
depravity
is
witchcraft
okoya
revolved
in
his
mind
whether
his
mother
was
not
perhaps
his
most
dangerous
enemy
on
the
other
hand
say
koitza
when
she
began
to
question
her
son
had
in
view
a
certain
object
she
was
anxious
to
find
out
who
the
maiden
was
whose
looks
had
at
once
charmed
her
next
she
was
curious
to
know
whether
the
meeting
of
the
two
was
accidental
or
not
therefore
the
leading
question
and
you
go
with
that
girl
under
ordinary
circumstances
his
affirmative
reply
might
have
filled
her
motherly
heart
with
joy
for
mitsha
appearance
had
struck
her
fancy
but
now
it
filled
her
with
dismay
nothing
good
to
her
could
result
from
a
union
between
her
child
and
the
daughter
of
tyope
that
union
would
be
sure
to
lead
okoya
over
to
the
home
of
his
betrothed
which
was
the
home
of
her
mother
where
he
could
not
fail
to
gradually
succumb
to
the
influence
which
that
mother
of
mitsha
a
sensual
cunning
sly
woman
utterly
subservient
to
her
husband
would
undoubtedly
exert
upon
him
it
was
not
maternal
jealousy
that
beset
her
now
and
filled
her
with
flaming
passion
it
was
fear
for
her
own
personal
safety
under
the
influence
of
sudden
displeasure
human
thought
runs
sometimes
astray
with
terrific
swiftness
say
koitza
saw
her
son
already
going
to
the
house
of
that
fiend
tyope
night
after
night
whereas
in
reality
he
had
never
called
there
as
yet
she
fancied
that
she
heard
him
in
conversation
with
this
girl
confiding
in
her
little
by
little
just
as
zashue
used
before
he
and
she
became
man
and
wife
but
what
could
okoya
tell
after
all
that
might
prove
of
harm
to
her
he
was
a
mere
child
as
yet
at
this
stage
of
her
reasoning
a
cloud
rose
within
her
bosom
and
spread
like
wildfire
was
it
not
strange
that
the
discovery
of
the
owl
feathers
the
betrayal
of
that
dread
secret
almost
coincided
with
okoya
open
relations
with
the
daughter
of
the
man
who
she
felt
sure
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
accusation
against
her
a
ghastly
suspicion
flashed
up
and
soon
became
so
vivid
that
no
doubt
could
arise
her
own
son
must
accidentally
have
discovered
the
fatal
feathers
he
himself
without
intending
any
harm
must
have
mentioned
them
to
the
girl
perhaps
even
in
the
presence
of
her
mother
say
became
satisfied
that
she
held
the
key
to
her
betrayal
the
riddle
was
solved
that
solution
dissipated
all
hopes
of
salvation
for
if
her
own
son
was
to
be
witness
against
her
in
the
dreaded
hour
when
the
tribal
council
had
to
determine
for
or
against
her
guilt
there
could
be
no
doubting
his
testimony
and
tyope
would
have
that
testimony
in
any
case
for
if
okoya
should
deny
okoya
own
betrothed
might
be
brought
face
to
face
with
him
as
a
witness
thus
she
reasoned
in
much
less
time
than
it
can
be
written
and
these
conclusions
overwhelmed
her
to
such
a
degree
that
she
turned
away
from
her
favourite
child
in
bitter
passion
with
the
conviction
that
her
son
in
whom
she
had
trusted
was
her
destroying
angel
she
hid
her
face
from
him
in
anger
and
grief
okoya
noticed
his
mother
feelings
her
anger
was
inexplicable
to
him
unless
it
meant
disappointment
in
relation
to
some
of
her
own
supposed
dark
designs
it
made
him
angrier
still
for
say
bitterness
against
the
koshare
was
in
his
opinion
only
feigned
persuaded
that
his
mother
was
false
to
him
and
that
she
was
even
harbouring
evil
designs
he
rose
abruptly
and
left
the
house
in
silence
he
could
no
longer
refuse
to
believe
that
she
was
planning
his
destruction
otherwise
why
did
she
oppose
what
to
him
appeared
the
prelude
to
a
happy
future
and
why
that
apparent
duplicity
on
her
part
condemning
the
koshare
to
his
face
and
as
he
thought
being
in
secret
understanding
with
them
only
one
explanation
was
reasonable
the
only
one
within
reach
of
the
indian
mind
that
say
koitza
was
in
some
connection
with
evil
powers
which
she
for
some
reason
unknown
to
him
was
courting
for
the
purpose
of
his
destruction
in
other
words
that
say
koitza
his
own
mother
was
a
witch
nothing
more
detestable
or
more
dangerous
than
witchcraft
is
conceivable
to
the
indian
to
a
young
and
untrained
mind
like
okoya
the
thought
of
being
exposed
to
danger
from
such
a
source
is
crushing
the
boy
felt
bewildered
dazed
he
leaned
against
the
wall
of
the
great
house
for
support
staring
at
the
huge
cliffs
without
seeing
them
he
looked
at
people
passing
to
and
fro
without
taking
any
notice
of
their
presence
he
could
not
even
think
any
more
but
merely
felt
felt
unutterably
miserable
if
only
he
knew
of
somebody
who
might
help
him
this
was
his
first
thought
after
recovering
strength
and
why
not
speak
to
hayoue
the
idea
was
like
the
recollection
of
a
happy
dream
and
indeed
he
had
harboured
it
before
it
roused
him
to
such
a
degree
that
he
tore
himself
away
from
the
wall
against
which
he
had
leaned
as
on
a
last
staff
and
straightening
himself
he
walked
deliberately
toward
the
upper
end
of
the
rito
where
the
of
the
water
clan
were
situated
hayoue
might
be
at
home
still
it
was
more
than
likely
that
the
don
juan
of
the
rito
had
been
spending
the
last
night
elsewhere
if
at
home
so
much
the
better
if
not
there
was
nothing
left
but
to
wait
until
he
came
the
prospect
of
waiting
and
resting
was
not
an
unpleasant
one
for
okoya
who
felt
exhausted
after
the
shock
of
disappointment
and
disgust
he
had
just
experienced
as
he
slowly
approached
the
recess
wherein
the
grottoes
of
the
water
clan
lay
he
halted
for
a
moment
to
catch
breath
and
just
then
descried
shotaye
who
was
coming
down
toward
him
the
woman
had
been
quite
a
favourite
of
his
ever
since
she
became
so
kind
to
his
sick
mother
nevertheless
he
had
always
felt
afraid
of
her
on
account
of
her
reputation
as
a
doubtful
character
now
the
sight
of
her
made
him
angry
for
she
was
his
mother
friend
and
a
witch
also
so
he
resumed
his
walk
and
passed
her
with
a
short
sulky
shotaye
noticed
his
surly
manner
and
looked
straight
at
him
returning
the
morose
greeting
with
a
loud
that
sounded
almost
like
a
challenge
then
she
went
on
with
a
smile
of
scorn
and
amusement
on
her
lips
she
was
not
afraid
of
the
young
fellow
for
she
attributed
his
surly
ways
to
sitting
up
late
okoya
was
glad
to
get
out
of
the
woman
reach
and
he
did
not
stop
until
at
the
entrance
to
the
caves
which
hayoue
and
his
folk
occupied
there
was
no
necessity
of
announcing
himself
he
merely
lifted
the
curtain
of
rawhide
that
hung
over
the
doorway
and
peeped
in
his
youthful
uncle
so
much
he
saw
at
a
glance
was
not
in
another
young
gentleman
of
the
tribe
lay
on
the
floor
beside
the
other
members
of
the
family
all
were
sound
asleep
yet
and
okoya
dropped
the
curtain
quietly
and
turned
toward
the
brook
on
its
banks
he
selected
a
spot
where
unseen
to
others
he
could
look
down
the
valley
here
he
threw
himself
on
the
ground
to
watch
and
await
hayoue
coming
although
deeply
anxious
to
meet
his
uncle
okoya
entertained
no
thought
of
impatience
he
had
to
wait
that
was
all
beside
his
heart
was
so
heavy
so
full
of
grief
and
despair
that
not
even
his
surroundings
could
divert
him
from
gloomy
thoughts
the
brook
murmured
and
rustled
softly
by
his
side
its
waters
looked
clear
and
limpid
he
neither
heard
nor
saw
them
he
only
longed
to
be
alone
completely
alone
until
his
uncle
should
come
okoya
had
not
performed
his
morning
ablutions
but
there
was
no
thought
of
them
for
he
was
in
deep
sorrow
and
when
the
indian
heart
is
heavy
he
is
very
careful
not
to
flat
on
his
stomach
with
chin
resting
on
both
hands
indifferent
to
the
peculiar
scenery
before
him
he
nevertheless
scanned
the
cliffs
as
far
as
they
were
visible
the
grottoes
of
tzitz
hanutsh
opened
right
in
front
of
him
lower
down
the
entrances
of
a
few
of
the
caves
of
kohaio
hanutsh
could
be
seen
for
the
rocks
jutted
out
like
towering
pillars
they
completely
shut
out
from
his
gaze
the
eastern
of
tzina
hanutsh
farther
to
the
east
the
wall
of
cliffs
swept
around
to
the
southeast
showing
the
houses
of
the
eagle
clan
built
against
its
base
the
caverns
of
yakka
hanutsh
opening
along
a
semicircle
terminating
in
a
sharp
point
of
massive
rocks
in
that
promontory
the
of
some
of
the
dwellings
of
the
cottonwood
people
were
visible
beyond
all
detail
became
undistinguishable
through
the
distance
for
the
north
side
of
the
rito
turned
into
a
dim
yellowish
wall
crowned
by
dark
okoya
lay
there
scanning
watching
every
doorway
back
and
forth
the
whole
length
of
the
view
hours
went
by
there
were
no
signs
of
hayoue
yet
okoya
did
not
rise
in
anger
and
pace
the
ground
with
impatience
he
did
not
scratch
his
head
or
stamp
he
did
not
even
think
of
swearing
he
simply
waited
and
his
patient
waiting
proved
of
comfort
to
him
for
he
gradually
cooled
off
and
freed
from
the
effects
of
his
violent
impressions
began
to
think
what
he
could
do
nothing
absolutely
nothing
at
least
until
he
had
seen
hayoue
to
wait
for
the
latter
was
a
necessity
if
it
took
him
the
whole
day
but
to
wait
in
the
same
posture
for
hours
was
rather
tiresome
so
he
rolled
over
on
his
back
and
folding
his
arms
under
his
head
began
to
gaze
on
the
skies
bright
and
cloudless
as
they
had
appeared
at
sunrise
a
change
had
come
over
them
since
which
attracted
even
okoya
attention
instead
of
the
usual
deep
azure
the
heavens
had
assumed
a
dingy
hue
and
long
white
streamers
traversed
them
like
arches
had
the
boy
looked
in
the
west
he
would
have
seen
shredded
clouds
looming
up
behind
the
mountains
a
sure
sign
of
approaching
rain
but
he
had
become
fascinated
by
what
was
directly
above
him
and
so
he
watched
with
increasing
interest
the
white
arches
overhead
slowly
imperceptibly
they
pushed
up
crossing
the
zenith
and
approaching
the
eastern
horizon
toward
which
the
boy
face
was
turned
and
while
they
shifted
they
grew
in
width
and
density
delicate
filaments
appeared
between
and
connected
bow
with
bow
gradually
thickening
until
the
zenith
was
but
one
vault
of
pale
gray
the
boy
watched
this
process
with
increased
eagerness
it
caused
him
to
forget
his
troubles
he
saw
that
rain
one
of
the
great
blessings
for
which
he
and
his
people
had
so
fervently
prayed
chanted
and
danced
yesterday
was
coming
on
and
his
heart
became
glad
the
spirits
the
shiuana
he
thought
were
kindly
disposed
toward
his
people
and
this
caused
him
to
wonder
what
the
shiuana
might
really
be
and
why
they
acted
so
and
so
and
not
otherwise
the
shiuana
he
had
been
taught
dwelt
in
the
clouds
and
they
were
good
why
then
was
it
that
from
one
and
the
same
cloud
the
beneficial
rain
descended
which
caused
the
food
of
mankind
to
grow
and
also
the
destructive
hail
and
the
deadly
thunderbolt
a
faint
muttering
sound
deep
and
prolonged
struck
his
ear
he
started
for
it
was
distant
thunder
the
shiuana
he
believed
had
read
his
thoughts
and
they
reminded
him
that
their
doings
were
beyond
the
reach
of
his
mind
turning
away
from
the
sights
above
he
looked
again
down
the
valley
there
at
last
came
the
hayoue
slowly
drowsily
like
one
who
has
slept
rather
late
than
long
hayoue
indeed
was
so
sleepy
yet
that
his
nephew
had
to
call
him
thrice
after
the
third
however
he
glanced
around
saw
okoya
beckoning
to
him
and
came
down
to
the
brook
yawning
and
rubbing
his
eyes
he
sat
down
and
okoya
said
satyumishe
i
want
to
speak
to
you
will
you
listen
to
my
speech
hayoue
smiled
but
looked
rather
indifferent
or
as
he
replied
i
will
what
is
it
about
surely
about
mitsha
your
girl
well
she
is
good
he
emphatically
added
but
tyope
is
not
good
not
good
he
exclaimed
looking
up
with
an
expression
of
strong
disgust
and
blowing
through
his
teeth
it
was
clear
that
the
young
man
was
no
friend
to
tyope
okoya
moved
uneasily
and
continued
in
a
muffled
tone
of
voice
you
are
not
right
nashtio
it
is
not
concerning
mitsha
that
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
what
else
then
hayoue
looked
up
in
surprise
as
if
unable
to
comprehend
how
a
boy
of
the
age
of
okoya
could
think
of
anything
else
than
of
some
girl
his
brother
son
took
from
his
neck
the
little
satchel
containing
sacred
meal
without
a
word
he
opened
it
and
scattered
the
flour
in
the
usual
way
to
the
six
regions
then
he
pointed
to
the
clouds
and
whispered
the
shiuana
are
good
at
the
same
time
handing
the
bag
to
his
uncle
the
latter
astonishment
had
reached
its
maximum
the
actions
were
utterly
incomprehensive
to
him
again
the
sound
of
distant
thunder
vibrated
from
the
west
and
the
cliffs
sighed
in
return
they
are
calling
us
okoya
whispered
hayoue
became
suddenly
very
sober
he
performed
the
sacrifice
in
silence
and
then
assumed
the
position
of
an
earnest
and
attentive
listener
do
you
like
the
koshare
began
okoya
in
a
whisper
no
but
why
do
you
ask
this
because
i
do
like
them
either
is
that
all
you
had
to
tell
me
i
could
have
told
you
that
in
their
own
presence
hayoue
seemed
to
be
disappointed
and
vexed
that
is
not
why
i
called
you
umo
okoya
continued
it
is
because
the
koshare
know
that
i
dislike
them
what
if
they
do
know
it
but
they
might
harm
me
they
can
not
otherwise
i
should
have
been
harmed
by
them
long
ago
but
i
do
care
for
them
illustration

picture
lining
up
for
the

lower
picture
the
clowns
okoya
shook
his
head
and
muttered
i
am
afraid
of
the
koshare
the
other
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
am
not
he
said
men
can
do
harm
with
their
hands
and
with
their
weapons
and
against
those
you
have
your
fist
and
the
shield
those
above
he
pointed
at
the
skies
can
harm
us
they
can
kill
us
but
men
why
we
can
defend
ourselves
okoya
felt
shocked
at
words
which
sounded
to
him
like
sacrilegious
talk
timidly
and
morosely
he
objected
do
you
know
that
there
are
witches
witches
there
are
no
witches
again
there
was
a
mutter
from
the
west
a
hollow
solemn
warning
and
the
cliffs
responded
with
a
plaintive
moan
even
incredulous
hayoue
started
and
okoya
sighed
i
will
tell
you
why
i
ask
all
this
said
he
and
he
went
on
to
explain
beginning
with
the
incident
provoked
by
shyuote
he
confessed
to
the
suspicions
which
it
had
aroused
in
his
mind
and
laid
the
whole
process
of
his
reasoning
bare
before
his
listener
his
speech
was
picturesque
but
not
consciously
poetic
for
the
indian
speaks
like
a
child
using
figures
of
speech
not
in
order
to
embellish
but
because
he
lacks
abstract
terms
and
is
compelled
to
borrow
equivalents
from
comparisons
with
surrounding
nature
hayoue
listened
attentively
occasionally
however
he
smiled
at
last
okoya
stopped
and
looked
at
his
friend
in
expectation
the
latter
cast
at
the
boy
a
humorous
glance
he
felt
manifestly
amused
by
his
talk
mot
tza
he
began
in
what
you
have
told
me
there
is
not
more
substance
than
in
the
clouds
above
when
the
shiuana
do
not
dwell
in
them
it
is
colour
white
colour
it
is
nothing
you
have
been
painting
the
picture
is
done
but
no
spirit
is
there
shyuote
is
a
lazy
idle
brat
he
shirks
work
but
when
you
say
to
him
sit
down
and
eat
then
he
all
at
once
becomes
active
in
this
way
he
sneaks
around
from
house
to
house
he
may
have
overheard
something
said
about
you
and
your
ways
he
may
even
have
surprised
the
koshare
while
talking
among
themselves
but
it
is
quite
as
likely
that
the
toad
has
invented
the
whole
story
just
in
order
to
anger
you
for
he
always
finds
time
to
sneak
to
lounge
and
to
hatch
lies
the
lazy
eavesdropper
i
tell
you
what
it
is
that
boy
is
fit
for
nothing
but
a
koshare
and
a
real
good
one
will
he
become
but
okoya
rejoined
if
the
delight
makers
have
spoken
about
the
yaya
and
me
there
must
be
some
cause
for
it
do
you
know
that
these
shutzuna
always
find
some
occasion
for
gossip
hayoue
cried
do
they
run
into
every
house
do
their
women
stick
their
noses
into
every
bowl
in
order
to
find
out
what
the
people
cook
and
eat
rest
easy
satyumishe
your
mother
is
good
she
has
nothing
in
common
with
the
koshare
but
is
not
the
nashtio
one
of
them
your
brother
my
father
is
he
like
the
rest
of
them
hayoue
replied
assuming
an
important
mien
it
is
true
that
brother
is
and
i
do
like
it
but
we
ca
change
it
it
was
so
ordained
long
ago
for
my
father
himself
was
koshare
beside
let
me
tell
you
that
not
all
that
the
koshare
do
is
wrong
if
there
were
no
koshare
it
would
not
be
good
for
the
people
they
must
see
that
those
above
assist
us
when
the
corn
ripens
and
inasmuch
as
they
perform
their
duties
they
are
necessary
to
us
it
is
also
well
that
they
should
bring
joy
and
mirth
among
the
tribe
but
he
raised
his
hand
and
his
eyes
flashed
they
must
not
go
beyond
their
duty
their
leader
shall
not
presume
to
be
more
than
the
hotshanyi
who
has
to
suffer
and
bear
for
our
sake
and
for
our
good
they
shall
do
their
duty
and
no
more
it
is
not
their
duty
to
make
people
believe
that
they
are
wiser
than
the
chayani
and
to
induce
the
people
to
give
them
bowl
after
bowl
full
of
meal
feathers
shells
and
whatever
else
may
be
good
and
precious
for
it
is
not
to
the
koshare
as
a
body
that
all
these
things
are
distributed
it
is
only
their
naua
who
gets
them
and
through
him
his
hanutsh
at
the
expense
of
all
the
other
clans
neither
shall
the
koshare
alone
enjoy
our
makatza
pretending
that
it
pleases
those
above
it
thundered
again
louder
and
longer
than
before
hayoue
stopped
and
then
went
on
zashue
fails
to
see
all
this
he
is
koshare
and
follows
in
the
tracks
of
the
others
like
a
blind
man
but
we
the
cuirana
we
see
it
i
am
not
a
principal
i
can
not
sit
in
council
and
speak
but
withal
i
have
noticed
these
doings
for
a
long
time
i
tell
you
mot
tza
that
if
the
delight
makers
the
old
fiend
who
rules
them
and
tyope
are
not
restrained
very
soon
there
will
be
sorrow
in
the
tribe
the
people
will
become
weak
because
they
will
be
discontented
and
finally
the
moshome
may
come
and
destroy
us
all
but
if
the
koshare
are
so
powerful
retorted
okoya
must
i
not
be
on
my
guard
with
some
of
them
to
be
sure
beware
of
tyope
and
of
the
old
rogue
they
are
base
and
dangerous
men
avoid
shtiranyi
avoid
ture
tihua

and
the
like
of
them

grandfather
brother
do
you
believe
they
would
forsake
you
mind
boy
even
if
the
koshare
be
against
you
you
are
not
lost
there
is
your
umo
topanashka
and
he
has
great
weight
with
the
old
men
with
the
council
and
with
the
people
there
is
your
clan
tanyi
and
in
fine
i
and
my
people
are
here
too
he
uttered
these
words
proudly
looking
at
his
nephew
encouragingly
but
okoya
was
not
fully
reassured
his
doubts
were
not
removed
there
was
one
thing
yet
that
he
held
in
reserve
for
the
last
and
that
was
his
dread
of
witchcraft
and
the
suspicion
that
such
a
danger
threatened
him
from
his
own
mother
he
resolved
to
tell
his
friend
all
including
the
scene
of
the
morning
and
the
conclusions
he
had
drawn
from
it
hayoue
said
he
you
are
good
and
wise
much
wiser
than
i
still
listen
to
me
once
more
louder
and
nearer
sounded
the
thunder
hayoue
bent
over
toward
okoya
a
close
attentive
sympathizing
listener
the
young
man
related
everything
his
relations
with
mitsha
how
he
had
quarrelled
with
his
mother
and
the
conclusions
at
which
he
had
arrived
touching
his
mother
evil
designs
and
practices
at
this
point
hayoue
began
to
laugh
and
laughed
till
he
coughed
and
you
really
believe
this
he
cried
but
at
once
he
grew
very
serious
and
even
stern
mot
tza
it
is
not
right
in
you
to
think
thus
of
your
mother
say
koitza
is
good
she
is
better
than
most
women
at
the
tyuonyi
far
too
good
for
my
brother
zashue
and
better
than
i
or
you
i
know
her
well
and
even
if
there
should
be
witches
which
i
do
not
believe
a
loud
thunderpeal
caused
the
mountains
to
tremble
hayoue
started
shook
his
head
and
muttered
they
call
loudly
it
may
be
that
there
are
witches
at
all
events
he
raised
his
voice
again
if
there
are
such
women
your
mother
does
not
belong
to
them
it
is
not
right
brother
for
you
to
think
such
things
of
your
mother
you
have
done
her
a
great
wrong
for
i
tell
you
again
she
is
good
and
she
is
your
best
friend
where
do
you
belong
whose
blood
is
yours
is
it
your
father
are
the
water
people
your
people
no
tanyi
is
your
hanutsh
your
mother
clan
are
your
kindred
mind
satyumishe
our
life
is
in
our
blood
and
it
is
the
blood
of
her
who
gave
you
life
that
flows
in
your
veins
when
you
say
aught
against
your
mother
you
tarnish
your
own
life
but
why
does
she
not
want
me
to
go
with
mitsha
okoya
asked
and
pouted
do
you
see
why
satyumishe
do
you
understand
it
say
knows
tyope
she
mistrusts
him
and
is
even
afraid
of
him
mitsha
is
a
good
girl
and
your
mother
has
nothing
against
her
but
she
is
her
daughter
and
that
mother
is
tyope
wife
if
mitsha
becomes
your
wife
you
will
go
and
live
with
her
until
tyame
hanutsh
has
a
house
ready
for
mitsha
you
will
even
have
to
stay
at
the
home
of
tyope
wife
now
i
can
not
say
that
hannay
the
wife
of
tyope
is
really
bad
she
is
not
nearly
as
bad
as
he
but
then
hannay
is
silly
and
allows
him
to
make
her
his
tool
everything
that
concerns
her
clan
things
that
he
of
course
is
not
entitled
to
know
she
tattles
to
him
and
she
tells
him
everything
else
that
she
sees
hears
or
imagines
i
know
it
to
be
so
now
your
mother
is
afraid
lest
through
mitsha
mother
first
mitsha
afterward
through
her
you
might
become
entangled
in
the
coils
of
that
tyope
for
i
tell
you
mot
tza
his
eyes
flashed
and
he
shook
his
clenched
fist
toward
the
houses
of
the
eagle
clan
that
man
is
a
bad
man
he
is
bad
from
head
to
foot
and
he
thinks
of
nothing
but
injury
to
others
for
the
sake
of
his
own
benefit
but
what
has
tyope
done
how
do
you
know
that
he
is
such
a
bad
man
that
just
it
he
never
acts
openly
like
the
badger
after
which
he
is
named
he
burrows
and
burrows
in
darkness
and
covers
up
his
ways
and
when
the
earth
caves
in
beneath
those
who
walk
over
his
trap
and
they
fall
he
is
already
far
away
and
looks
as
innocent
and
bland
as
a
badger
on
top
of
the
ground
but
if
you
follow
him
then
he
will
turn
around
and
snap
at
you
like
a
real
tyope
your
mother
is
right
in
fearing
him
perhaps
not
so
much
on
her
account
as
for
your
sake
you
and
mitsha
are
both
very
young
and
that
man
knows
how
to
entrap
such
little
rabbits
okoya
could
not
deny
the
truth
of
his
uncle
speech
he
felt
that
he
had
wronged
his
mother
had
misinterpreted
her
motives
and
now
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
nevertheless
indian
nature
is
exceedingly
wary
and
suspicious
in
all
important
matters
and
it
struck
him
that
hayoue
was
trying
to
dissuade
him
from
his
project
of
union
with
mitsha
knowing
the
propensities
of
his
gallant
uncle
in
the
matter
of
women
he
began
to
suspect
that
the
latter
might
wish
to
estrange
him
from
the
girl
or
frighten
him
off
in
order
to
step
into
his
shoes
so
he
assumed
an
air
of
quiet
indifference
and
said
i
think
it
is
better
after
all
not
to
see
mitsha
any
more
with
this
he
attempted
to
rise
but
hayoue
held
him
back
and
spoke
very
earnestly
no
it
would
not
be
well
you
are
fit
for
each
other
and
you
must
come
together
i
will
help
you
all
i
can
can
you
help
me
okoya
exclaimed
delightfully
surprised
perhaps
i
can
perhaps
not
i
will
talk
to
your
mother
and
get
her
to
be
in
your
favour
but
there
is
one
thing
you
must
promise
me
faithfully
and
that
is
to
be
very
very
careful
when
you
go
to
the
house
of
tyope
wife
and
you
are
asked
about
anything
say
nothing
reveal
nothing
in
regard
to
matters
of
our
clans
but
what
you
might
shout
over
the
housetops
with
perfect
impunity
otherwise
and
his
voice
sounded
like
an
impressive
warning
you
may
do
great
injury
to
the
tribe
but
if
mitsha
herself
inquires
of
me
you
must
be
wise
brother
wiser
than
she
is
for
women
are
seldom
wise
only
forward
curious
and
inquisitive
wisdom
and
the
dandy
of
the
rito
shrugged
his
shoulders
is
a
gift
to
man
never
to
woman
when
you
and
mitsha
are
together
alone
be
wise
do
ask
her
anything
that
does
not
concern
you
and
if
she
begins
to
pry
into
your
matters
you
will
have
a
right
to
say
to
her
do
pry
into
your
affairs
so
do
ask
me
about
those
of
my
people
i
am
sure
that
she
will
let
you
alone
thereafter
for
mitsha
is
a
good
girl
nevertheless
be
careful
for
it
is
as
certain
as
that
the
brook
runs
through
here
that
they
will
attempt
to
draw
you
out
tyope
will
say
to
his
wife
out
this
or
that
from
him
he
may
even
tell
her
why
he
wants
to
know
it
the
woman
goes
to
her
daughter
and
bids
her
ask
the
boy
about
such
and
such
a
thing
but
she
is
careful
not
to
let
out
why
and
that
tyope
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
inquiry
the
girl
suspects
nothing
wrong
and
asks
you
and
you
tell
her
all
you
know
in
this
manner
precious
things
get
little
by
little
into
evil
hands
and
the
end
of
it
is
evil
if
you
will
promise
me
that
you
will
be
very
cautious
i
will
speak
to
say
koitza
such
words
that
she
will
feel
glad
to
see
you
and
mitsha
become
one
okoya
seized
the
hand
of
his
friend
breathed
on
it
then
clasped
it
with
both
hands
lifting
it
up
to
heaven
he
could
not
utter
a
word
joy
and
hope
deprived
him
of
the
power
of
speech
hayoue
suffered
him
to
go
through
this
ceremony
he
also
felt
glad
the
storm
was
drawing
nearer
dense
clouds
hovered
over
the
rito
but
they
did
not
notice
them
louder
and
louder
the
thunders
rolled
and
in
quicker
succession
came
the
peals
they
heeded
not
from
the
heights
in
the
west
there
was
a
sound
of
gushing
rain
they
paid
no
attention
to
it
hayoue
spoke
again
something
i
have
yet
to
tell
you
although
mitsha
may
like
you
and
even
if
her
mother
be
in
your
favour
perhaps
as
much
for
her
own
sake
as
on
her
daughter
account
he
added
with
a
scornful
smile
it
is
by
no
means
certain
that
tyope
will
give
his
consent
if
you
become
his
tool
if
you
let
him
wield
you
as
a
hand
wields
flint
or
stone
then
he
will
be
in
your
favour
if
not
he
will
not
be
he
knows
very
well
how
precious
mitsha
is
and
with
the
aid
of
her
mother
and
of
that
clan
he
hopes
to
sell
his
pretty
girl
to
his
own
best
advantage
unless
you
are
willing
to
let
him
use
you
to
grind
his
corn
as
a
woman
grinds
it
on
the
yanyi
you
have
no
chance
he
will
barter
away
mitsha
to
a
navajo
if
thereby
he
reaches
his
ends
okoya
started
horrified
is
tyope
as
bad
as
that
he
asked
do
you
recollect
nacaytzusle
the
savage
stranger
boy
hayoue
inquired
in
return
i
do
but
he
has
left
us
it
does
not
matter
for
to
that
wild
wolf
he
would
rather
give
mitsha
than
let
her
be
your
wife
there
is
no
danger
of
my
obtaining
her
he
added
with
a
grim
smile
for
he
hates
me
like
a
true
it
is
that
i
too
detest
him
as
i
do
a
spider
okoya
felt
bewildered
why
should
he
give
mitsha
to
a
moshome
he
timidly
inquired
what
would
he
gain
by
it
i
do
know
and
nobody
knows

perhaps
the

and
no

had

it
was

that
whenever
the
koshare
appeared
in
public
she
was
certain
to
stay
at
home
in
point

she
seldom
left
her
cell

it
was
to
ascend
one
of

gathering

herbs
shotaye
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
being
a
strange
and
even
mysterious
being
and
so
long
as
her
services
were
not
absolutely
required
nobody
cared
to
intrude
upon

she
often
received
visitors
of
the

to
the
edge

the
brook

turned
to
the
right
up
the
course
of
the
streamlet
that
the
skies
threatened
to
become
overcast
and
that
rain
might
overtake

little
whenever
the
indian
is
bent
upon
the
performance
of
some
task
sunshine
or
rain
moonlight
or

are
matters
of
indifference
shotaye
strolled
on
regardless
of
things
above
or
below
people
were
of
as
little
interest
to
her
as
the
clouds
the
latter
could
do
her
errand
no
harm
and
that
errand
everybody
might
know
if
they
chose
to
follow
her
wandering
up
the
gorge
of
the
rito
and
along
its
northern
limit
the
woman
soon
reached
the
upper
part
where
the
cliffs
crowd
the
edge
where
the
southern
slopes
become
more
rugged
and
the
valley
terminates
there
a
series
of
gigantic
steps
formed
by
high
and
beetling
rocks
closes
the
rito
to
the
west
down
that
mass
of
ledges
the
brook
trickles
from
its
source
and
a
trail
formerly
much
used
by
the
navajos
on
their
raids
creeps
up
meandering
over
and
between
crags
ledges
and
shelves
of
bare
rock
this
trail
was
seldom
trodden
at
that
time
and
then
only
by
armed
men
for
it
was
regarded
as
dangerous
notwithstanding
the
proximity
of
the
settlement
at
the
rito
the
navajos
dinne
or
moshome
lurked
here
quite
often
and
many
an
unfortunate
had
lost
his
life
while
ascending
the
trail
alone
shotaye
was
therefore
travelling
an
exceedingly
hazardous
road
but
she
did
not
think
of
danger
many
a
time
before
had
she
clambered
up
and
down
this
rocky
labyrinth
and
while
the
dinne
fairly
swarmed
nothing
had
ever
happened
to
her
it
is
true
that
she
was
exceedingly
wary
and
had
in
her
innumerable
excursions
gathered
quite
as
much
knowledge
of
the
tricks
of
war
as
the
most
experienced
scout
so
that
she
felt
almost
intuitively
the
approach
of
danger
she
had
gradually
become
imbued
with
the
idea
that
she
was
invulnerable
therefore
she
moved
along
this
dangerous
trail
with
the
greatest
apparent
furthermore
her
thoughts
so
completely
absorbed
her
that
while
ascending
from
the
level
of
the
rito
she
unconsciously
went
on
thinking
of
nothing
else
but
of
what
say
koitza
had
told
her
in
the
cave
and
of
the
plans
for
relief
which
she
had
begun
to
devise
or
at
least
to
revolve
in
her
mind
the
trail
is
not
only
rough
and
long
it
is
very
steep
in
places
and
the
woman
stopped
for
rest
sitting
on
a
ledge
of
rocks
below
her
the
vale
was
no
longer
visible
a
dark
chasm
yawned
at
her
feet
out
of
it
the
cliffs
of
the
tyuonyi
rose
like
the
heads
of
giants
one
more
difficult
stretch
had
to
be
overcome
before
shotaye
could
reach
the
timber
crowning
the
plateau
on
the
northern
cliffs
of
the
rito
massive
benches
or
ledges
abrupt
and
high
seemed
to
render
farther
ascent
impracticable
but
shotaye
kept
on
after
a
short
stop
without
the
slightest
hesitation
the
trail
wound
its
way
upward
it
crept
from
rocky
step
to
rocky
step
led
her
from
crags
to
narrow
bands
skirting
dizzy
cliffs
until
she
came
to
a
level
where
the
timber
of
the
northern
mesa
was
easily
reached
once
in
the
shade
of
pines
she
looked
around
the
original
object
of
her
expedition
returned
to
her
mind
and
she
scanned
with
particular
care
the
underbrush
in
hope
of
finding
there
the
herbs
on
which
she
based
the
efficacy
of
her
cures
it
thundered
audibly
but
that
was
nothing
to
her
there
close
to
a
grew
one
of
the
coveted
plants
she
went
to
it
knelt
down
and
began
to
pull
it
up
by
the
roots
suddenly
she
felt
both
of
her
upper
arms
seized
with
irresistible
power
her
body
was
jerked
backward
ere
she
could
think
of
resistance
she
was
lying
on
the
ground
not
a
shriek
however
escaped
her
mouth
for
although
surprised
the
woman
had
presence
of
mind
enough
to
think
that
either
tyope
or
some
navajo
must
have
attacked
her
in
either
case
it
was
useless
to
scream
for
in
either
case
she
was
lost
as
soon
however
as
she
was
able
to
glance
at
her
captor
her
worst
fears
were
dispelled
the
man
or
being
whatever
he
might
be
loosened
his
grip
and
stood
erect
he
looked
down
into
her
face
and
grinned
that
grin
did
not
in
the
least
beautify
his
already
horrible
features
the
creature
was
indeed
a
man
but
so
disfigured
by
paint
and
accoutrements
that
any
one
unaccustomed
to
the
appearance
of
indian
warriors
in
full
dress
must
necessarily
have
taken
him
for
some
fiend
or
demon
from
the
nether
world
he
was
of
robust
build
his
muscular
chest
was
naked
to
the
waist
a
kilt
of
covered
his
thighs
and
his
feet
rested
on
small
hoops
laid
horizontally
and
tied
to
them
like
sandals
face
and
body
were
painted
with
a
black
metallic
powder
under
each
eye
there
was
a
red
dash
out
of
this
sinister
face
the
eyes
gleamed
like
living
coals
and
the
smile
though
intended
for
a
friendly
token
appeared
more
like
a
beastly
leer
a
cap
covered
the
skull
to
the
ears
giving
it
the
appearance
of
ghastly
baldness
from
under
this
protection
coarse
locks
of
black
hair
protruded
shotaye
looked
up
at
the
monster
and
strange
to
say
returned
his
horrid
grin
with
a
smile
and
with
encouraging
winks
but
the
man
did
not
move
he
only
let
go
her
arms
so
she
rose
thereupon
he
touched
her
right
arm
with
his
left
hand
pointed
at
himself
with
the
right
and
uttered
in
a
strange
dialect
tehua
afterward
he
pointed
at
her
adding
tema
quio
and
accompanied
these
words
by
most
significant
gestures
shotaye
did
not
understand
the
language
but
the
signs
were
clear
to
her
koitza
she
replied
imitating
his
motions
tehua
hachshtze
and
with
a
wink
amoshko
the
indian
shook
his
head
he
dropped
the
arm
of
the
woman
made
with
both
hands
the
motion
of
stringing
a
bow
and
exclaimed
uan
save
grasping
the
that
hung
from
his
wrist
he
struck
two
or
three
blows
with
it
at
random
repeated
the
words
uan
save
and
looked
askance
this
was
beyond
shotaye
powers
of
comprehension
she
again
pointed
at
herself
saying
tyuonyi
koitza
then
in
the
direction
of
the
rito
made
the
for
killing
and
looked
at
the
stranger
inquiringly
and
with
an
anxious
face
now
the
indian
understood
her
his
eyes
sparkled
he
shook
his
head
emphatically
uttering
nyo
nyo
tema
uan
save
uan
save
at
the
same
time
he
pointed
to
the
west
and
brandished
his
it
became
clear
to
the
woman
that
the
warrior
was
on
an
expedition
against
the
navajos
and
not
after
the
scalps
of
her
own
people
but
it
was
equally
plain
to
her
that
being
on
the
any
kind
of
enjoyment
was
prohibited
to
him
this
was
a
disappointment
and
the
strange
dialogue
came
therefore
to
a
each
eyed
the
other
in
silence
all
at
once
the
stranger
stepped
up
to
her
and
extending
his
arms
to
the
west
asked
uan
save
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
in
silence
quio
he
said
now
and
grasped
her
hand
tupoge
pointing
toward
the
rito
quio
he
beckoned
her
to
go
with
him
puye
waving
his
hand
to
the
north
lastly
he
grinned
and
whispered
cuinda
there
was
no
possibility
of
misunderstanding
the
smile
and
the
motions
although
the
words
of
course
were
beyond
shotaye
comprehension
in
return
she
pointed
to
the
west
again
made
the
conventional
sign
for
night
and
sleep
and
began
to
count
her
fingers
as
she
bent
the
eighth
digit
the
tehua
stopped
her
held
up
every
finger
of
the
right
hand
and
three
of
the
left
described
as
if
in
confirmation
eight
times
an
arch
from
east
to
west
and
concluded
by
pointing
to
the
north
exclaiming
very
emphatically
puye
he
looked
at
her
and
laughed
aloud
as
the
indian
does
when
he
feels
delighted
pressed
both
hands
against
his
chest
and
uttered
proudly
cayamo
shotaye
she
eagerly
replied
the
hero
burst
out
in
immoderate
laughter
shotaye
shotaye
he
repeated
caught
hold
of
one
of
her
hands
caressed
his
chest
with
it
and
danced
about
merrily
exclaiming
cuindae
cayamo
cuindae
shotaye
cuinda
he
counted
the
number
eight
several
times
and
then
suddenly
bent
down
one
of
his
sandals
had
become
loose
these
sandals
consisted
as
mentioned
before
of
wooden
hoops
covered
by
strips
of
and
tied
to
the
naked
foot
with
bands
of
the
same
material
the
wearer
stood
on
them
as
on
wheels
lying
flat
on
the
ground
he
was
able
to
walk
and
even
to
run
at
a
moderate
speed
and
the
prints
which
he
made
being
circular
gave
a
pursuing
enemy
no
clew
to
the
direction
of
his
going
or
coming
while
the
man
was
stooping
and
fastening
the
leather
thongs
shotaye
scanned
his
appearance
thoroughly
she
perceived
on
his
back
aside
from
a
bow
and
the
usual
quiver
filled
with
a
shield
the
painting
on
that
shield
she
examined
with
particular
care
the
target
was
painted
white
with
a
black
rim
and
in
the
centre
was
a
green
crescent
with
four
red
crosses
such
figures
have
no
heraldic
signification
they
are
but
the
creation
of
fancy
or
taste
and
recall
the
designs
of
the
ancient
teutons
which
tacitus
describes
scuta
tantum
lectissimis
coloribus
distinguunt
shotaye
evidently
took
an
interest
in
the
stranger
he
on
the
other
hand
looked
up
to
her
from
time
to
time
with
a
terrific
grin
that
was
intended
for
a
sweet
smile
as
often
as
he
turned
his
face
toward
her
she
sought
to
decipher
his
real
features
which
the
rendered
utterly
unrecognizable
at
last
the
sandal
was
fastened
again
and
the
tehua
stood
erect
he
waved
his
hand
to
the
west
and
north
repeated
the
words
cayamo
cuinda
and
placed
a
finger
on
his
lips
she
nodded
raised
eight
fingers
softly
uttered
raua
raua
shotaye
and
pointed
to
the
north
also
thereupon
he
moved
away
stealthily
but
before
disappearing
in
the
timber
he
turned
around
once
more
and
waved
his
hand
northward
the
woman
replied
with
affirmative
nods
and
after
his
form
had
disappeared
she
also
turned
to
go
her
eyes
sparkled
a
gleam
of
intense
satisfaction
illumined
her
features
as
with
head
erect
and
heedless
of
the
plants
she
had
come
to
gather
she
penetrated
deeper
into
the
forest
she
now
went
due
east
in
a
direction
opposite
to
the
one
the
tehua
had
taken
this
had
been
a
very
remarkable
meeting
indeed
more
than
ever
shotaye
believed
that
she
was
invulnerable
the
queres
of
the
rito
and
the
tehuas
living
north
of
them
on
the
other
side
of
savage
and
more
than
a
day
journey
distant
were
not
always
on
the
best
of
terms
there
was
no
regular
intercourse
between
the
tribes
for
the
speech
of
one
differed
from
that
of
the
other
barter
and
traffic
took
place
at
long
intervals
but
as
not
a
soul
at
the
tyuonyi
spoke
tehua
and
no
one
at
the
puye
understood
queres
such
attempts
at
commercial
intercourse
usually
terminated
in
a
fracas
in
bloodshed
even
and
the
party
offended
sought
to
make
things
even
afterward
by
waylaying
and
murdering
such
of
the
other
side
as
might
chance
to
wander
in
the
neighbourhood
of
their
abodes
actual
warfare
had
taken
place
between
the
tribes
within
the
time
of
recollection
and
engagements
were
fought
one
party
got
worsted
and
ran
home
the
other
went
home
too
and
that
settled
the
matter
for
the
time
being
it
was
therefore
not
at
all
safe
for
an
indian
from
the
rito
to
meet
one
from
the
puye
and
women
made
an
exception
inasmuch
as
they
were
exposed
only
to
capture
and
adoption
in
the
tribe
to
which
their
captors
belonged
such
compulsory
adoption
was
rendered
very
easy
by
the
fact
that
nearly
the
same
clans
existed
among
all
the
pueblos
but
the
eagle
clan
for
instance
which
the
queres
called
tyame
hanutsh
in
their
dialect
bore
in
the
tehua
language
the
name
of
tzedoa
as
soon
as
shotaye
saw
into
whose
hands
she
had
fallen
she
felt
completely
reassured
even
if
she
were
carried
off
a
prisoner
it
was
no
misfortune
when
moreover
she
discovered
that
the
stranger
had
not
even
such
an
object
in
view
but
was
after
the
scalp
of
some
navajo
she
experienced
a
feeling
of
delight
when
at
last
the
indian
readily
understood
her
suggestions
and
went
so
far
as
to
indicate
a
day
when
she
should
come
to
him
at
the
puye
her
gladness
knew
no
bounds
in
the
accidental
meeting
all
her
hopes
for
relief
had
been
realized
she
was
now
able
to
save
herself
by
flight
to
the
other
tribe
but
enough
time
was
left
her
to
provide
for
the
safety
of
her
companion
in
peril
she
had
no
hope
or
thought
of
becoming
the
wife
of
her
new
acquaintance
he
was
probably
married
but
marriage
as
we
have
seen
was
no
obstacle
to
temporary
outside
friendships
she
could
take
refuge
at
the
puye
without
hesitation
and
claim
the
protection
of
her
warrior
in
case
she
afterward
felt
like
tying
herself
to
one
man
only
there
was
no
doubt
in
her
mind
that
a
domestic
animal
of
the
husband
could
easily
be
found
how
often
could
she
have
been
married
at
the
rito
had
the
men
not
looked
upon
her
as
a
witch
the
friend
whom
she
had
now
secured
among
the
tehuas
called
himself
cayamo
thus
much
she
had
guessed
and
guessed
rightly
but
would
she
be
able
to
recognize
him
after
his
face
was
washed
and
the
military
undress
exchanged
for
that
of
civil
life
never
mind
she
had
noted
the
paintings
on
his
shield
and
that
was
enough
there
are
no
two
shields
alike
in
one
village
and
by
uttering
the
name
cayamo
and
describing
the
white
escutcheon
with
a
green
crescent
and
four
red
crosses
a
thing
easy
for
indian
she
could
not
fail
to
identify
him
that
cayamo
would
recognize
her
and
acknowledge
her
acquaintance
she
did
not
doubt
for
a
moment
she
even
hoped
to
meet
him
half
way
on
the
trail
to
the
village
of
his
tribe
provided
the
navajos
did
not
kill
the
hero
while
she
sincerely
hoped
that
he
would
return
safe
and
in
possession
of
many
scalps
there
was
still
a
possibility
of
his
own
scalp
being
taken
by
the
enemy
the
navajos
were
very
cunning
and
their
arrows
were
tipped
with
very
sharp
flint
with
all
her
feelings
for
her
knight
and
the
reliance
she
placed
on
his
broad
shoulders
heavy
neck
strong
arms
and
legs
accidents
remained
possible
in
case
cayamo
should
never
return
to
his
native
village
what
then
well
he
was
not
the
only
man
among
the
tehuas
and
that
consoled
her
there
seemed
to
be
but
one
dark
point
in
the
otherwise
bright
outlook
would
she
have
time
to
put
her
plans
in
execution
would
the
koshare
would
tyope
leave
her
sufficient
respite
things
might
have
taken
place
during
and
after
the
dance
that
changed
the
face
of
matters
and
precipitated
them
beyond
remedy
in
case
for
instance
that
the
delight
makers
had
overturned
say
household
as
they
were
wont
to
overturn
others
and
had
discovered
the
feathers
was
not
all
hope
gone
shotaye
suddenly
recollected
how
okoya
had
greeted
her
that
morning
how
surly
his
glance
how
gruff
and
unfriendly
his
call
was
that
significant
still
if
the
secret
had
been
disclosed
there
would
surely
have
been
some
noise
about
it
the
night
before
on
the
other
hand
it
might
be
that
the
council
had
the
case
in
hand
and
preferred
not
to
make
anything
public
for
the
present
what
if
the
council
were
in
deliberation
at
the
very
moment
discussing
her
fate
and
that
of
her
accomplice
would
it
not
be
safer
instead
of
returning
to
the
rito
to
follow
the
tracks
of
her
new
friend
cayamo
and
join
him
on
his
dangerous
errand
yes
it
would
have
been
safer
provided
cayamo
would
have
tolerated
the
companionship
of
a
woman
but
this
he
was
not
allowed
to
enjoy
and
furthermore
what
would
then
become
of
that
accomplice
of
hers
the
latter
thought
staggered
her
shotaye
was
a
very
strange
woman
she
was
heartless
merciless
remorseless
in
everything
that
concerned
her
relations
to
others
one
person
only
she
excepted
in
her
selfish
calculations
and
that
was
her
accomplice
and
victim
say
koitza
happen
what
might
she
could
not
forsake
say
she
must
at
all
hazards
go
back
to
the
tyuonyi
call
at
her
house
and
find
out
from
her
whether
or
not
anything
had
occurred
that
might
jeopardize
her
plans
and
designs
in
case
matters
were
unchanged
she
intended
to
tell
her
friend
the
occurrence
of
the
day
giving
her
at
the
same
time
directions
for
the
future
shotaye
quickened
her
step
for
the
road
was
long
it
was
not
advisable
to
return
by
the
trail
she
had
taken
in
coming
for
she
needed
a
pretext
for
running
into
the
abode
of
say
koitza
as
if
by
chance
at
last
she
noticed
the
change
in
the
weather
and
the
approaching
shower
and
thought
it
a
good
plan
to
regulate
her
gait
so
as
to
reach
the
valley
and
the
big
house
when
the
storm
broke
she
might
then
seek
shelter
under
her
friend
roof
and
avoid
suspicion
crashing
thunder
roared
in
the
high
sierra
and
as
shotaye
looked
around
she
saw
the
that
swept
down
on
the
mesas
in
advance
of
the
shower
the
sierra
de
la
jara
had
vanished
in
the
clouds
and
gray
fleeces
whirled
about
the
flanks
of
the
sierra
de
san
miguel
she
stood
on
the
brink
above
the
eastern
end
of
the
rito
and
began
to
descend
over
boulders
and
crags
and
through
bushes
only
a
part
of
the
valley
was
visible
in
the
not
a
living
soul
appeared
faster
and
faster
shotaye
ran
regardless
of
rocks
and
shrubbery
the
western
mountains
were
completely
shrouded
lightning
tore
the
clouds
thunder
bellowed
nearer
and
stronger
at
last
she
reached
the
bottom
and
turned
toward
the
houses
panting
perspiring
but
untired
as
she
passed
the
new
house
of
the
corn
clan
the
first
angry
blast
of
the
storm
met
her
and
she
had
to
stop
it
filled
her
with
lively
satisfaction
however
to
see
how
accurately
she
had
regulated
her
movements
she
might
get
into
the
big
house
almost
unnoticed
for
the
rain
began
to
fall
at
the
moment
when
hayoue
and
okoya
found
shelter
in
the
caves
of
the
water
clan
shotaye
dashed
through
the
gangway
of
the
building
a
tremendous
shower
was
falling
and
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
court
she
was
drenched
from
head
to
foot
to
the
great
delight
of
those
who
well
protected
themselves
were
standing
in
the
doorways
of
their
quarters
one
single
voice
called
to
her
to
come
in
but
she
took
no
notice
of
it
blinded
by
the
torrents
of
falling
water
she
groped
her
way
along
the
walls
and
finally
stumbled
into
the
open
door
of
say
koitza
home
not
a
single
thread
of
her
scanty
clothing
was
dry
her
hair
soaked
and
dripping
clung
to
her
forehead
and
cheeks
as
if
glued
to
the
skin
water
filled
her
eyes
nostrils
and
ears
she
removed
the
hair
from
her
brow
shook
herself
coughed
sneezed
and
looked
around
the
room
was
empty
but
in
the
inner
cell
a
fire
crackled
on
the
hearth
and
say
came
out
at
the
sight
of
her
friend
she
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
and
asked
where
do
you
come
from
tziro
kauash
shotaye
coughed
then
in
a
whisper
she
inquired
are
you
alone
say
brow
clouded
and
a
deadly
pang
seized
her
what
meant
this
query
this
call
so
unusual
so
mysterious
in
a
low
hollow
tone
she
replied
we
are
alone
and
turned
back
into
the
kitchen
her
friend
question
sounded
like
a
prelude
to
dismal
tidings
both
women
squatted
close
to
the
fire
not
a
word
was
spoken
the
was
busy
drying
herself
and
the
mistress
of
the
house
was
struck
by
her
rather
cheerful
looks
possibly
her
sad
presentiment
was
wrong
it
was
almost
impossible
to
talk
except
in
a
very
loud
tone
for
the
rain
fairly
roared
peals
of
thunder
followed
each
other
in
quick
succession
flashes
of
yellow
lightning
quivered
outside
of
the
little
the
room
itself
was
very
dark
how
often
had
the
two
women
sat
here
years
ago
in
anxious
doubt
but
hopeful
at
last
how
often
had
say
koitza
complained
to
her
friend
on
this
very
spot
complained
of
her
illness
of
the
sad
outlook
before
her
and
when
she
began
to
recuperate
how
often
she
told
shotaye
about
her
plans
for
the
future
now
that
future
had
come
and
in
what
shape
the
roaring
outside
diminished
gradually
the
thunder
sounded
more
remote
through
the
roof
of
mud
and
brush
rivulets
of
water
began
to
burst
forming
little
puddles
on
the
mud
floor
and
dripping
on
the
heads
of
the
two
women
shotaye
took
no
notice
of
it
but
say
moved
to
avoid
the
moisture
the
roof
seemed
a
sieve
the
floor
became
a
lagune
shotaye
inquired
have
the
koshare
been
here
they
have
the
other
said
and
they
turned
everything
upside
down
but
found
nothing
shotaye
drew
a
long
breath
exclaiming
then
everything
is
right
all
right
and
you
are
safe
but
the
wife
of
zashue
tihua
shook
her
head
mournfully
no
sa
tao
she
replied
it
can
not
save
me
i
am
lost
lost
beyond
hope
rest
easy
sister
believe
me
the
assured
her
you
are
saved
they
can
do
you
no
harm
it
rained
softly
in
the
inside
of
the
room
it
went
on
pat
pat
pat
pat
dripping
through
the
ceiling
shotaye
resumed
the
conversation
speak
sa
tao
she
said
speak
and
tell
me
what
you
think
why
is
it
that
you
still
believe
that
bad
men
will
be
able
to
do
you
harm
you
know
sister
that
you
are
safe
from
them
now
and
that
they
can
not
injure
you
any
more
say
koitza
shook
her
head
gloomily
and
replied
pointing
to
her
ear
and
eye
sanaya
what
the
ear
hears
and
the
eye
sees
the
heart
must
fain
believe
then
speak
to
me
tell
me
sa
uishe
what
it
is
that
your
ear
has
heard
your
eye
has
seen
that
makes
your
heart
so
sad
the
woman
spoke
softly
entreatingly
as
if
she
was
soothing
a
sick
child
but
the
object
of
her
sympathy
sighed
and
continued
in
the
same
tone
of
utter
despondency
sister
had
you
been
present
at
the
ayash
tyucotz
when
all
the
people
danced
and
sang
your
eyes
would
have
seen
what
the
heart
could
not
approve
i
saw
my
son
okoya
tihua
the
child
of
tanyi
hanutsh
dancing
beside
mitsha
koitza
the
girl
from
tyame
and
she
is
the
daughter
of
our
base
enemy
illustration
type
of
old
indian
woman
is
that
all
that
causes
you
trouble
koya
shotaye
very
placidly
asked
listen
to
me
further
yaya
say
entreated
this
morning
i
took
the
boy
to
task
for
it
and
then
i
found
out
that
mitsha
is
near
to
him
nearer
than
his
own
mother
i
discovered
that
he
goes
to
see
her
and
thus
gets
to
the
house
of
the
woman
of
whom
they
say
that
she
is
tyope
ear
and
eye
tongue
and
mouth
what
do
you
say
to
that
sa
tao
shotaye
smiled
have
you
ever
spoken
to
mitsha
never
exclaimed
say
how
could
i
speak
to
one
whose
mother
is
a
and
whose
father
a
carrion
crow
is
that
all
you
know
say
cried
how
mean
tyope
is
if
my
child
goes
to
see
his
child
is
it
not
easy
for
the
young
serpent
to
ask
this
and
that
of
my
son
then
she
will
go
and
tell
the
old
her
mother
who
will
whisper
it
to
tyope
himself
do
you
see
it
sister
the
argument
was
forcible
and
shotaye
felt
the
truth
of
it
the
other
proceeded
okoya
may
have
been
going
with
the
girl
for
a
long
while
and
i
knew
nothing
of
it
have
you
found
out
sister
she
leaned
forward
and
looked
at
her
guest
with
a
very
earnest
expression
how
the
koshare
have
learned
about
the
owl
feathers
in
my
house
the
other
shook
her
head
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
neither
have
i
continued
say
but
might
not
okoya
the
hand
of
her
friend
closed
her
lips
hush
cried
the
imperatively
speak
not
believe
not
think
not
such
a
thing
okoya
is
good
i
too
know
the
boy
he
will
never
do
what
you
suspect
but
say
was
too
excited
to
listen
to
her
she
drew
shotaye
hand
away
from
her
mouth
and
exclaimed
remember
that
it
is
but
a
short
time
that
the
koshare
have
known
about
the
feathers
and
remember
you
that
okoya
is
of
your
own
blood
he
is
young
and
the
makatza
has
great
power
over
him
for
he
likes
her
when
zashue
her
voice
trembled
and
she
turned
her
face
away
with
a
suppressed
sigh
came
to
me
and
i
went
to
him
he
often
told
me
things
about
your
people
things
that
your
hanutsh
would
not
have
liked
had
they
known
that
i
knew
of
them
hush
i
tell
you
again
hush
koitza
the
other
commanded
hush
or
i
will
never
listen
to
you
any
more
you
loathe
your
own
flesh
the
very
entrails
that
have
given
birth
to
the
mot
tza
i
tell
you
again
okoya
is
good
he
is
far
better
than
his
father
thus
much
i
know
and
know
it
well
she
looked
hard
at
the
wife
of
zashue
while
her
lips
disdainfully
curled
say
cast
her
eyes
to
the
ground
she
did
not
care
to
learn
about
her
husband
outside
affairs
it
was
very
still
in
the
dark
room
even
the
rain
was
scarcely
heard
and
from
the
ceiling
it
dripped
in
one
place
only
the
very
spot
where
the
owl
feathers
had
lain
buried
it
seemed
as
if
the
waters
from
heaven
were
eager
to
assist
in
obliterating
every
trace
of
the
fatal
tuft
shotaye
turned
away
from
her
friend
indignantly
the
mere
thought
of
a
mother
accusing
her
child
and
such
a
son
as
okoya
was
revolting
to
her
say
hung
her
head
and
pouted
and
yet
she
felt
that
shotaye
was
right
after
all
and
then
it
was
so
gratifying
to
hear
from
own
lips
how
good
her
son
was
sanaya
she
asked
after
a
while
timidly
tell
me
for
what
you
came
no
the
other
curtly
answered
say
started
be
not
angry
with
me
she
pleaded
i
do
not
mean
anything
wrong
and
yet
you
slander
your
best
child
say
koitza
began
to
sob
shotaye
continued
angrily
you
may
well
weep
whoever
speaks
ill
of
his
own
blood
as
you
do
ought
to
be
sad
and
shed
tears
forever
listen
to
me
koitza
okoya
is
good
he
will
not
betray
anybody
and
least
of
all
his
mother
and
hear
my
words
mitsha
also
is
good
as
good
as
her
father
is
bad
as
wise
as
her
mother
is
foolish
even
if
okoya
had
found
the
feathers
and
had
told
makatza
of
it
she
would
keep
it
to
herself
and
the
secret
would
lie
buried
within
her
heart
as
deep
as
if
it
rested
beneath
the
nethermost
rock
on
which
the
tetilla
stands
and
in
the
end
let
me
tell
you
she
raised
her
head
defiantly
and
her
eyes
flashed
if
okoya
likes
the
girl
and
she
wants
him
they
are
sure
to
come
together
you
can
not
prevent
it
neither
can
tyope
the
tapop
the
hotshanyi
not
even
the
whole
tribe
those
on
high
hold
the
paths
of
our
lives
they
alone
can
do
and
undo
make
and
unmake
say
wept
no
more
she
was
convinced
and
lifted
her
eyes
again
mother
it
was
shyuote
voice
which
called
into
the
outer
room
from
the
mother
come
out
and
look
at
the
fine
rainbow
with
this
he
dashed
into
the
inner
door
and
stood
there
the
very
incarnation
of
dirt
he
had
been
playing
at
delight
makers
in
the
outside
with
some
of
his
comrades
and
was
covered
with
splashes
of
mud
from
head
to
foot
say
bounded
from
her
seat
and
pushed
back
the
forward
youngster
who
is
with
you
sanaya
he
inquired
while
retreating
nobody
you
i
want
to
be
alone
i
have
no
time
to
look
at
your
rainbow
get
away
and
she
hustled
him
outside
and
quickly
returned
to
the
kitchen
but
shyuote
not
satisfied
with
his
mother
statement
rushed
to
the
to
see
for
himself
this
shotaye
had
expected
and
as
soon
as
his
dirty
face
darkened
the
opening
it
received
a
splash
of
muddy
that
caused
the
boy
to
desist
from
further
prying
after
say
had
resumed
her
seat
by
the
hearth
shotaye
bent
toward
her
and
whispered
mark
me
the
shiuana
are
with
us
the
rainbow
stands
in
the
skies
those
above
know
that
what
i
speak
to
you
is
the
truth
okoya
mother
nodded
she
was
fully
convinced
the
took
up
the
former
subject
again
do
not
misunderstand
me
sister
she
said
i
do
not
say
that
it
is
well
that
okoya
should
go
to
the
house
of
the
girl
mother
there
is
danger
in
it
but
your
son
is
careful
and
wise
and
mitsha
is
good
as
good
as
our
mother
on
high
therefore
do
cross
his
path
let
him
go
as
he
pleases
and
if
mitsha
should
come
to
you
be
kind
to
her
for
she
deserves
it
all
this
however
the
tone
of
her
voice
changed
suddenly
is
not
what
i
came
to
see
you
for
what
i
have
to
tell
you
concerns
me
and
you
alone
keep
it
precious
as
precious
as
the
green
stone
hidden
in
the
heart
of
the
yaya
and
whatever
may
happen
be
silent
about
it
as
silent
as
the
mountain
keep
your
lips
closed
against
everybody
until
the
time
comes
when
we
must
speak
say
nodded
eagerly
and
shotaye
was
fully
satisfied
with
the
mute
pledge
for
she
knew
that
the
woman
dared
not
betray
her
believe
me
she
continued
your
life
is
safe
you
will
not
you
can
not
be
harmed
say
koitza
looked
at
her
in
surprise
she
could
not
realize
the
truth
of
these
hopeful
tidings
they
found
nothing
in
your
house
resumed
the
other
because
i
presume
you
removed
the
feathers
in
time
and
in
this
you
were
wise
if
tyope
says
that
he
saw
you
holding
owl
feathers
in
your
hands
and
you
have
not
kept
them
who
can
speak
against
you
at
the
council
rest
assured
of
one
thing
tyope
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
our
troubles
and
unless
he
or
somebody
else
watched
you
while
you
buried
the
hapi
at
the
foot
of
the
beams
on
which
the
koshare
go
up
to
their
cave
nobody
will
believe
him
when
he
rises
against
you
are
you
sure
she
added
that
nobody
saw
you
they
were
all
up
there
so
zashue
himself
told
me
tyope
also
tyope
say
replied
with
animation
i
saw
tyope
he
was
outside
clinging
to
the
rock
on
high
like
a
squirrel
to
a
tree
but
he
could
not
see
me
then
child
you
are
safe
let
them
do
as
they
please
but
if
he
comes
and
says
saw
say
and
shotaye
with
black
corn
and
owl
feathers
on
it
and
i
heard
them
ask
of
the
evil
corn
to
speak
to
them
then
everybody
will
say
is
a
witch
say
only
her
tool
we
must
punish
shotaye
she
must
be
killed
and
that
will
be
the
end
of
it
she
brought
her
face
so
close
to
that
of
her
friend
that
the
latter
while
unable
to
see
her
features
clearly
felt
her
breath
the
last
words
of
the
shocked
say
she
stood
toward
shotaye
almost
in
the
relation
of
a
helpless
child
and
the
thought
of
seeing
her
friend
exposed
to
death
produced
a
feeling
of
dismay
and
sadness
but
sanaya
she
asked
how
can
they
harm
you
and
let
me
go
free
am
i
not
as
guilty
as
you
what
you
did
was
it
not
for
me
for
my
good
why
may
i
not
go
along
if
they
send
you
to
our
mother
at
shipapu
hush
sa
uishe
the
other
retorted
do
not
speak
thus
i
have
led
you
to
do
things
which
those
on
high
do
not
like
so
i
alone
must
suffer
nevertheless
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
other
lap
rest
easy
i
shall
not
die
in
her
simplicity
say
when
shotaye
mentioned
the
probability
of
her
suffering
capital
punishment
had
not
thought
of
her
children
and
of
the
consequences
that
would
arise
in
case
she
herself
were
to
share
that
fate
she
felt
greatly
relieved
upon
hearing
the
speak
so
hopefully
of
her
own
case
for
she
bethought
herself
of
those
whom
she
would
leave
motherless
but
her
curiosity
was
raised
to
the
highest
pitch
eager
and
anxious
to
learn
upon
what
grounds
shotaye
based
her
assurance
of
safety
say
nestled
close
to
her
side
in
order
not
to
lose
a
syllable
of
the
talk
it
was
necessary
for
shotaye
proceeded
in
a
slow
solemn
whisper
sister
i
shall
be
accused
and
you
will
be
accused
also
if
you
are
brought
before
the
council
and
they
ask
you
about
our
doings
deny
everything
say
no
to
everything
except
when
the
black
corn
is
spoken
of
that
you
may
confess
they
will
inquire
of
you
why
we
used
the
evil
cobs
answer
and
mark
well
my
words
that
you
did
not
understand
what
i
was
doing
that
you
only
did
what
i
told
you
to
do
lay
all
the
blame
on
me
but
it
is
not
true
the
little
woman
objected
never
mind
provided
you
go
free
they
then
will
kill
you
say
cried
be
not
concerned
about
me
i
will
save
myself
how
can
you
that
is
my
secret
still
this
i
will
confide
to
you
her
whisper
became
scarcely
audible
as
she
added
i
shall
flee
whither
gasped
say
in
surprise
to
the
tehuas
but
sa
tao
be
silent
as
silent
as
the
stone
as
quiet
as
kohaio
when
in
winter
he
is
asleep
whatever
you
may
hear
heed
it
not
what
you
may
see
do
not
notice
deny
everything
you
can
deny
and
what
you
have
to
confess
lay
on
me
do
as
i
tell
you
sa
uishe
she
insisted
as
say
moved
uneasily
and
trust
to
me
for
the
rest
shotaye
arose
shook
her
wet
garments
and
stepped
into
the
outer
room
there
she
turned
around
once
more
and
repeated
in
a
low
but
impressive
voice
sa
tao
trust
in
me
and
believe
also
that
okoya
is
good
and
mitsha
better
yet
be
kind
to
both
and
be
silent
she
stepped
into
the
and
say
koitza
remained
standing
in
the
doorway
the
rain
had
ceased
the
sky
was
clear
again
all
ablaze
with
the
richest
golden
hues
over
the
crest
of
the
big
houses
it
was
near
sunset
say
watched
her
friend
as
she
went
to
the
entrance
and
as
shotaye
form
vanished
in
the
dark
passage
okoya
emerged
from
it
coming
toward
his
mother
slowly
shyly
but
with
a
smile
on
his
countenance
that
was
surely
a
good
omen
and
she
anticipated
the
timid
guatzena
with
which
he
was
about
to
greet
her
by
a
warm
and
pleasant
raua
opona
chapter
ix
the
interview
between
okoya
and
hayoue
which
took
place
at
almost
the
same
time
that
shotaye
fell
in
with
the
tehua
indian
on
the
mesa
had
completely
changed
the
mind
of
say
koitza
eldest
son
and
turned
his
thoughts
into
another
channel
he
saw
clearly
now
to
what
extent
he
had
been
led
astray
by
mere
imagination
to
what
sinister
depths
his
reasoning
had
carried
him
since
hayoue
talk
okoya
felt
like
another
man
the
world
of
his
thoughts
limited
as
it
was
still
appeared
now
in
rosy
hues
and
encouraging
in
spite
of
all
obstacles
these
obstacles
he
saw
in
their
true
light
and
the
last
warning
of
hayoue
had
made
a
deep
impression
but
obstacles
clearly
understood
are
half
surmounted
already
and
threatened
people
live
long
it
is
not
good
for
man
to
be
alone
okoya
had
felt
the
truth
of
it
bitterly
now
that
he
knew
that
he
was
not
forsaken
he
was
filled
with
strength
and
vigour
on
the
whole
an
indian
is
much
less
exposed
to
isolation
than
a
white
man
for
his
clan
and
in
a
wider
range
his
tribe
stand
by
him
against
outside
danger
but
when
that
danger
arises
within
the
narrow
circle
of
constant
surroundings
there
is
imminent
peril
okoya
had
fancied
that
such
peril
threatened
his
own
existence
and
that
he
stood
alone
and
unsupported
now
he
saw
that
in
any
event
he
would
be
neither
abandoned
nor
forsaken
and
this
imparted
to
his
spirit
a
degree
of
buoyancy
which
he
had
never
experienced
before
when
he
issued
from
the
cave
where
both
his
uncle
and
he
had
found
shelter
the
storm
was
over
and
nature
had
assumed
a
different
aspect
a
heavy
shower
in
the
mountains
of
new
mexico
is
often
followed
by
illuminations
of
peculiar
beauty
so
it
happened
then
the
west
where
the
sun
had
already
descended
behind
the
mountains
was
crossed
by
a
series
of
arches
displaying
successively
from
below
upward
the
most
resplendent
gold
bright
orange
green
and
finally
deep
blue
colours
in
the
eastern
skies
the
hovered
still
in
a
mass
of
inky
clouds
above
the
horizon
but
these
clouds
had
receded
beyond
the
graceful
cone
of
the
tetilla
which
stood
out
in
front
of
the
dark
mass
of
the
storm
sharply
defined
with
a
rosy
hue
cast
over
every
detail
of
its
slopes
the
air
was
of
wonderful
transparency
and
every
tint
of
the
brilliant
heavens
above
and
in
the
west
seemed
to
reproduce
itself
with
increased
intensity
on
the
dark
cloudy
bank
in
the
east
in
the
dazzling
arch
of
a
magnificent
rainbow
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
no
longer
penetrated
the
depths
of
the
vale
they
only
grazed
the
tops
of
the
tallest
pines
changing
them
into
pyramids
of
sparkling
light
okoya
looked
at
the
scenery
before
him
but
its
beauty
was
not
what
caused
him
to
gaze
and
to
smile
the
indian
is
quite
indifferent
to
the
sights
of
nature
except
from
the
standpoint
of
strictest
and
plainest
utilitarianism
the
rainbow
fascinated
the
boy
not
through
its
brilliancy
and
the
perfection
of
the
arch
but
because
the
rainbow
was
in
his
conception
shiuana
and
a
messenger
from
those
above
where
the
ends
of
the
luminous
arch
appear
to
rest
a
message
from
heaven
is
said
to
be
deposited
no
more
favourable
token
could
have
greeted
him
for
although
the
message
was
not
for
him
since
the
brilliant
bow
seemed
to
stand
far
off
from
the
rito
still
the
shiuana
the
spirits
graced
the
sky
with
their
presence
they
appeared
clad
in
the
brightest
hues
and
what
is
bright
and
handsome
is
to
the
indian
a
harbinger
of
good
no
wonder
therefore
that
the
boy
greeted
his
mother
with
a
happy
face
and
a
pleasant
smile
he
had
passed
shotaye
in
the
entrance
and
his
salutation
to
her
was
widely
different
from
the
gruff
notice
he
had
taken
of
her
in
the
morning
when
afterward
he
met
his
mother
gaze
and
saw
how
kindly
she
looked
at
him
how
warm
her
invitation
to
come
in
sounded
his
heart
bounded
with
delight
and
he
obeyed
her
summons
with
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
his
appearance
was
not
very
prepossessing
for
between
the
caves
and
the
big
house
a
number
of
newly
created
and
rivulets
had
crossed
his
path
his
scanty
clothing
was
profusely
bespattered
and
broad
cakes
of
mud
clung
to
the
soles
of
his
naked
feet
before
entering
the
house
he
carelessly
shook
off
and
scraped
away
the
heaviest
flakes
and
then
went
in
and
sat
down
on
the
bundle
of
skins
say
koitza
offered
him
no
change
of
clothing
she
did
not
bring
a
pair
of
slippers
warm
and
dry
for
his
wet
feet
no
she
simply
went
into
the
kitchen
and
let
him
alone
such
is
the
indian
custom
but
in
the
kitchen
she
began
to
move
about
she
was
cooking
and
that
proved
beyond
a
doubt
that
everything
must
be
right
again
after
a
while
she
squatted
in
the
inner
doorway
and
inquired
where
were
you
while
it
was
raining
with
hayoue
how
late
did
he
come
home
she
laughed
he
chimed
in
and
answered
late
enough
i
had
to
wait
a
long
time
before
he
came
and
so
sleepy
was
he
as
tired
and
sleepy
as
a
bear
in
spring
do
you
know
where
he
spent
the
night
the
tone
of
the
conversation
sounded
easy
and
pleasant
i
do
know
the
name
of
the
makatza
here
okoya
laughed
again
and
his
mother
caught
the
contagion
but
she
must
belong
to
oshatsh
he
did
not
say
much
for
he
was
tired
from
yesterday
was
she
a
short
stumpy
girl
i
do
know
it
must
have
been
the
same
one
with
whom
he
was
at
the
dance
i
paid
no
attention
to
her
it
is
haatze
i
know
her
she
is
a
strong
girl
and
tall
do
you
think
he
goes
to
see
her
okoya
asked
it
may
be
and
it
may
be
not
hayoue
goes
to
every
one
he
is
like
a
fly
he
sits
down
everywhere
and
stops
nowhere
okoya
enjoyed
hugely
his
mother
joke
the
latter
with
some
hesitancy
continued
does
he
also
visit
mitsha
koitza
okoya
bent
down
to
avoid
her
glance
then
he
resolutely
replied
no
are
you
sure
of
it
i
am
sure
he
cast
a
furtive
glance
at
his
mother
did
mitsha
tell
you
not
in
the
harsh
tone
of
an
inquisitor
were
these
words
uttered
say
spoke
them
softly
gently
and
okoya
was
comforted
he
was
moved
by
the
question
no
he
replied
in
the
same
manner
hayoue
spoke
to
me
about
it
say
felt
a
decided
relief
it
was
clear
to
her
now
where
okoya
had
spent
the
day
and
how
he
had
spent
it
she
liked
her
husband
younger
brother
and
trusted
him
although
very
fond
of
the
other
sex
hayoue
was
still
honest
and
trustworthy
in
everything
else
her
son
had
evidently
spoken
to
his
uncle
about
mitsha
and
in
say
estimation
he
could
not
have
chosen
a
better
person
in
whom
to
confide
hayoue
she
knew
harboured
toward
tyope
sentiments
akin
to
her
own
his
advice
to
okoya
must
therefore
have
been
sound
on
the
other
hand
she
was
herself
since
the
talk
with
shotaye
greatly
drawn
toward
mitsha
this
made
her
anxious
to
find
out
what
hayoue
thought
of
the
girl
so
she
put
the
direct
question
you
spoke
with
your
nashtio
about
mitsha
i
did
what
says
he
of
the
makatza
had
the
room
been
better
lighted
say
would
have
seen
how
flushed
face
became
notwithstanding
the
tawny
colour
of
his
complexion
the
boy
saw
at
once
that
he
had
confessed
much
more
than
he
had
intended
that
the
secret
of
his
interview
of
the
morning
was
divulged
recede
he
could
not
neither
could
he
conceal
his
embarrassment
he
began
to
twist
the
end
of
his
wrap
and
stammered
he
says
not
much
and
then
he
stared
at
the
doorway
with
that
stolid
air
which
the
indian
assumes
when
he
is
in
trouble
does
he
speak
good
or
ill
say
insisted
good
muttered
okoya
casting
his
eyes
to
the
ground
the
mild
soft
smile
which
played
over
his
mother
features
as
he
uttered
the
word
escaped
him
when
he
raised
his
eyes
again
her
looks
were
serious
though
not
stern
he
was
completely
bewildered
what
had
occurred
to
cause
his
mother
to
speak
in
this
manner
had
she
changed
her
mind
since
morning
and
why
so
suddenly
he
had
of
course
no
thought
of
attributing
to
shotaye
and
to
her
influence
this
surprisingly
favourable
change
for
he
did
not
know
the
intimate
relations
existing
between
her
and
his
mother
so
he
remained
silent
staring
wrapped
in
his
own
musings
his
mother
looked
at
him
in
silence
also
but
with
a
smile
at
last
she
asked
sa
uishe
will
you
eat
yes
he
replied
considerably
relived
by
this
turn
in
the
conversation
he
rose
and
moved
briskly
toward
the
entrance
to
the
cooking
apartment
but
say
held
him
back
tell
me
but
tell
me
the
truth
did
hayoue
say
it
was
well
for
you
to
go
with
mitsha
okoya
was
so
embarrassed
by
this
direct
query
that
he
could
not
answer
at
once
he
stood
still
and
hung
his
head
tell
me
child
say
insisted
he
said
the
words
were
scarcely
audible
that
it
was
well
did
he
also
say
it
was
good
for
you
to
listen
to
the
words
of
tyope
and
his
woman
now
light
began
to
dawn
upon
the
boy
he
felt
a
presentiment
of
something
favourable
no
he
exclaimed
he
said
that
i
must
beware
of
tyope
and
of
his
koitza
but
that
mitsha
i
could
trust
then
it
is
well
sa
uishe
replied
the
mother
come
in
and
eat
okoya
could
hardly
believe
his
senses
had
his
mother
really
said
it
is
well
was
it
possible
that
she
was
satisfied
and
in
sympathy
with
his
feeling
toward
mitsha
such
was
his
surprise
that
he
performed
his
prayers
before
squatting
down
to
the
meal
without
a
thought
of
the
kopishtai
to
whom
he
scattered
crumbs
mechanically
he
forgot
to
eat
and
stared
like
a
blind
man
with
eyes
wide
open
heedless
of
the
food
heedless
of
everything
around
him
eat
said
say
to
him
twice
she
repeated
the
invitation
ere
he
came
to
himself
and
reached
out
for
the
first
morsel
aware
of
his
mute
astonishment
and
conscious
of
his
perplexity
his
mother
finally
asked
what
is
the
matter
with
you
mot
tza
he
merely
shook
his
head
and
stared
very
few
young
indians
in
okoya
condition
would
have
placed
so
much
stress
on
their
mother
consent
or
dissent
all
or
nearly
all
of
them
would
simply
have
left
the
old
home
and
would
have
joined
their
betrothed
at
her
mother
house
and
only
the
clan
and
not
the
family
could
have
interfered
with
their
action
in
the
case
of
okoya
it
was
different
and
unusual
circumstances
complicated
the
matter
clan
was
that
of
topanashka
his
own
maternal
grandfather
and
if
he
spoke
against
the
union
matters
would
be
desperate
his
mother
therefore
held
the
key
to
the
situation
inasmuch
as
through
her
both
the
eagle
clan
to
which
mitsha
belonged
and
tanyi
hanutsh
his
own
consanguine
cluster
could
be
favourably
or
unfavourably
influenced
as
things
appeared
now
all
seemed
most
promising
even
his
mother
who
a
short
time
ago
had
expressed
herself
so
bitterly
against
his
choice
was
now
favourable
to
it
what
could
tyope
do
under
such
circumstances
nothing
at
all
so
the
boy
reasoned
unconsciously
but
beside
he
felt
glad
he
felt
happy
because
his
mother
approved
of
him
he
was
fond
of
his
mother
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
as
fond
as
any
indian
can
be
say
koitza
approved
his
choice
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
and
still
she
had
not
spoken
plainly
as
yet
at
any
other
time
he
would
have
maintained
a
prudent
reserve
and
waited
his
time
to
inquire
he
felt
so
surprised
so
completely
stupefied
that
only
one
course
was
left
him
and
that
was
to
learn
her
real
feelings
by
asking
his
mother
directly
for
an
explanation
of
her
inexplicable
demeanour
when
therefore
say
asked
again
what
ails
you
mot
tza
why
you
eat
he
turned
to
her
with
a
heavy
sigh
placed
both
hands
on
his
knees
and
replied
i
can
not
eat
until
i
have
asked
a
question
of
you
tell
me
yaya
how
it
is
that
this
morning
when
i
said
to
you
that
i
was
going
with
mitsha
koitza
you
grew
angry
at
me
and
now
you
say
it
is
right
tell
me
sanaya
how
it
comes
about
that
you
like
the
girl
in
the
evening
whereas
in
the
morning
she
was
not
precious
to
you
his
mother
smiled
she
sat
down
beside
him
and
her
face
almost
touched
his
own
the
glare
of
the
fire
illuminated
her
features
so
that
their
expression
became
fully
visible
to
him
then
she
spoke
softly
umo
have
i
not
often
said
to
you
of
tyope
is
it
not
so
sa
uishe
okoya
nodded
affirmatively
can
you
suppose
that
i
should
feel
easy
at
heart
if
you
go
to
the
house
where
dwells
the
woman
of
that
man
okoya
trembled
this
was
a
discouraging
beginning
had
he
mistaken
his
mother
views
in
a
faltering
voice
he
replied
no
say
continued
when
for
the
first
time
you
said
and
i
see
each
other
i
felt
afraid
my
heart
spoke
to
me
and
said
your
child
is
lost
and
then
sa
nashka
became
angry
this
was
early
in
the
morning
but
afterward
when
i
was
sitting
alone
here
and
the
shiuana
called
loudly
above
during
the
storm
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
some
kopishtai
whispered
is
good
she
is
as
good
as
okoya
she
will
belong
to
him
and
not
to
her
mother
much
less
to
her
father
and
as
i
was
thinking
i
heard
the
kopishtai
again
saying
to
me
is
good
he
is
your
child
and
mitsha
will
become
your
daughter
for
she
is
of
your
father
own
blood
and
as
the
kopishtai
thus
spoke
the
shiuana
thundered
louder
and
more
loud
then
i
thought
it
must
be
right
and
good
for
the
mot
tza
to
go
to
the
girl
and
i
was
no
longer
angry
and
then
you
came
and
i
asked
you
what
i
wanted
to
know
and
you
told
me
what
hayoue
had
said
so
it
is
well
and
thus
it
shall
remain
the
sigh
of
relief
heaved
by
okoya
at
hearing
these
words
was
as
sincere
as
it
was
deep
he
had
barely
strength
to
ask
in
the
meekest
manner
possible
then
you
have
nothing
against
my
going
to
mitsha
nothing
i
like
to
see
you
go
for
mitsha
is
good
and
her
voice
became
a
whisper
the
shiuana
have
thus
disposed
it
but
she
spoke
louder
again
hear
me
go
to
mitsha
and
to
her
alone
but
i
can
not
disown
her
mother
and
father
you
need
do
nothing
of
the
kind
unless
you
wish
be
pleasant
to
the
man
as
behooves
you
but
be
careful
never
say
sanaya
is
doing
this
or
that
or
they
speak
so
or
so
at
the
estufa
if
tyope
queries
what
is
your
yaya
doing
answer
her
usual
work
if
he
inquires
about
what
is
going
on
in
the
estufa
of
tanyi
hanutsh
reply
to
him
i
am
only
a
boy
and
do
not
know
what
the
men
talk
about
to
tyope
wife
say
nothing
but
what
even
shyuote
might
hear
to
the
makatza
you
can
say
us
be
together
and
live
for
each
other
and
talk
as
is
right
what
concerns
your
hanutsh
shall
be
hidden
from
me
and
i
will
be
silent
on
anything
that
concerns
mine
if
you
will
do
thus
sa
uishe
then
you
can
go
to
see
mitsha
and
i
myself
would
like
to
see
the
girl
who
is
to
become
my
child
this
was
too
much
for
okoya
he
grasped
with
both
his
hands
the
hand
of
his
mother
carried
it
to
his
lips
and
breathed
on
it
then
he
gave
back
the
hand
and
said
with
an
effort
you
are
good
yaya
and
i
will
do
as
you
say
hayoue
said
to
me
the
same
things
you
have
hayoue
is
a
true
friend
his
tongue
is
like
his
heart
and
you
did
right
in
taking
his
advice
a
tall
figure
stepped
into
the
apartment
with
a
shuffling
step
his
loud
greeting
guatzena
cut
off
further
talk
for
a
moment
both
mother
and
son
taken
by
surprise
answered
raua
it
was
hayoue
himself
who
thus
suddenly
appeared
he
complied
with
the
request
to
sit
down
and
afterward
with
the
customary
invitation
to
eat
but
he
seemed
as
much
surprised
as
the
inmates
themselves
for
while
eating
his
glance
flitted
inquiringly
from
mother
to
son
as
if
he
were
astonished
to
see
them
together
when
he
had
finished
he
asked
when
will
zashue
be
here
i
do
not
know
replied
say
hayoue
turned
to
his
nephew
okoya
will
you
let
me
speak
to
your
yaya
alone
these
words
he
accompanied
with
a
knowing
wink
at
the
young
man
it
amused
okoya
to
see
that
his
uncle
came
so
decidedly
in
the
matter
but
he
at
once
rose
and
went
out
in
the
it
was
still
very
damp
and
hardly
anybody
was
outside
of
the
dwellings
but
from
the
estufas
there
sounded
merry
talking
singing
and
the
beating
of
drums
okoya
stood
a
while
in
the
doorway
undecided
whether
he
ought
not
to
go
to
mitsha
at
once
he
wavered
but
at
last
the
impressions
received
during
the
day
especially
the
warnings
about
mitsha
mother
prevailed
and
he
concluded
not
to
go
at
this
time
he
was
afraid
as
yet
to
cross
the
threshold
of
that
woman
home
so
he
crept
into
the
estufa
of
tanyi
hanutsh
sat
down
beside
the
others
and
soon
joined
in
the
chorus
of
discordant
voices
in
the
everlasting
refrain
in
the
meantime
hayoue
had
drawn
closer
to
say
in
the
kitchen
saying
i
have
come
to
speak
to
you
concerning
okoya
she
motioned
to
him
to
remain
where
he
was
and
said
half
in
jest
half
in
earnest
stay
where
you
are
i
hear
you
you
talk
loud
enough
for
me
rest
easy
sam
n
he
replied
with
a
peal
of
laughter
that
fairly
shook
his
tall
and
slender
form
have
no
fear
i
am
tired
out
after
yesterday
but
i
must
talk
to
you
about
the
mot
tza
he
patted
his
knees
and
looked
straight
into
her
face
are
you
aware
that
your
child
goes
with
the
child
of
tyope
i
am
said
say
with
a
smile
what
do
you
think
of
it
good
was
the
simple
reply
and
you
good
yes
in
one
way
and
not
good
in
another
what
do
you
think
of
the
girl
the
woman
inquired
very
very
good
hayoue
emphatically
exclaimed
but
her
mother
and
her
father
he
hissed
through
his
teeth
and
shook
his
head
with
every
sign
of
disgust
they
are
very
very
bad
i
think
as
you
do
said
okoya
mother
and
yet
i
know
that
the
boy
is
good
and
the
girl
is
good
why
should
they
not
go
together
i
say
the
same
but
how
comes
it
that
you
believe
so
now
i
presume
the
mot
tza
has
told
you
a
different
story
say
suggested
with
a
smile
hayoue
nodded
i
thought
differently
she
explained
but
now
my
heart
has
changed
you
are
right
the
young
man
said
approvingly
adding
but
he
must
avoid
the
snares
which
that
tyope
may
set
for
him
and
we
must
preserve
him
from
them
i
warned
him
so
have
i
and
he
promised
to
be
wise
had
we
not
better
speak
to
zashue
suggested
say
koitza
hayoue
remained
thoughtful
for
a
while
then
he
said
i
dislike
to
say
aught
against
my
own
brother
but
in
this
matter
i
dislike
to
speak
to
him
he
is
okoya
father
objected
say
true
but
he
is
koshare
and
completely
under
tyope
influence
nevertheless
do
as
you
like
for
you
know
him
better
than
i
do
he
ought
to
come
soon
say
said
and
rose
she
went
out
a
noise
of
quarrelling
children
was
approaching
the
door
soon
she
clearly
distinguished
the
voice
of
shyuote
scolding
come
with
me
worm
go
home
frog
he
yelled
and
mournful
cries
succeeded
to
his
kind
invitation
at
the
same
time
his
young
sister
propelled
by
a
violent
push
of
his
fist
stumbled
into
the
outer
room
and
grasped
the
dress
of
her
mother
for
protection
satyumishe
is
beating
me
whined
the
little
one
glancing
anxiously
toward
the
entrance
in
the
doorway
appeared
shyuote
himself
a
solid
lump
of
mud
from
head
to
foot
his
black
eyes
stared
out
of
the
dirty
coating
that
covered
his
face
like
living
coals
the
appearance
of
his
mother
put
an
end
to
his
hostile
actions
he
felt
uncertain
about
the
manner
in
which
they
would
be
viewed
by
his
parent
say
quickly
changed
his
forebodings
into
absolute
certainty
are
you
not
ashamed
of
yourself
you
big
ugly
uak
she
scolded
to
beat
your
poor
little
sister
she
would
not
come
home
neither
would
you
lazy
brat
else
you
would
have
been
here
a
long
while
ago
do
not
cry
my
heart
she
turned
to
the
weeping
child
do
not
weep
he
will
not
hurt
you
any
more
the
bad
bad
weep
not
she
took
the
crying
child
into
her
arms
in
order
to
carry
her
into
the
kitchen
but
on
the
way
she
turned
back
and
called
shyuote
what
do
you
want
growled
the
boy
and
stumbled
after
her
do
you
know
where
your
nashtio
is
he
is
coming
go
and
tell
him
to
come
say
that
hayoue
is
here
and
that
he
wants
to
see
him
did
i
not
tell
you
that
he
was
coming
muttered
the
unruly
lad
this
answer
was
too
much
for
hayoue
who
until
now
had
been
a
mere
listener
he
said
in
a
peculiar
tone
of
command
will
you
go
or
not
you
silly
lazy
whelp
go
at
once
or
i
will
lead
you
where
your
father
is
and
he
pretended
to
rise
shyuote
had
not
noticed
the
presence
of
his
uncle
his
sudden
appearance
upon
the
scene
was
to
him
an
unwelcome
sight
and
he
sped
away
with
unusual
and
commendable
alacrity
hayoue
was
greatly
amused
and
laughed
aloud
that
urchin
he
said
is
more
afraid
of
me
than
of
zashue
and
you
together
the
brat
is
no
good
and
will
never
do
for
anything
but
a
koshare
how
different
is
okoya
say
had
again
squatted
near
the
hearth
she
gathered
the
crying
child
into
her
arms
the
little
girl
continued
to
sob
for
a
while
and
at
first
refused
to
eat
finally
say
persuaded
her
to
take
one
of
the
and
still
sobbing
she
pushed
the
greater
portion
of
it
gradually
into
her
little
mouth
thus
chewing
sobbing
and
resting
on
the
lap
of
her
mother
the
child
forgot
all
fear
and
ultimately
forgot
herself
and
fell
asleep
umo
say
began
again
i
think
it
is
better
to
speak
to
zashue
about
it
not
that
he
has
anything
to
do
in
the
matter
but
then
you
know
how
it
is
sooner
or
later
he
must
hear
of
it
and
if
we
tell
him
first
he
may
perhaps
assist
us
in
teaching
okoya
and
advising
him
about
the
future
all
the
boy
needs
is
counsel
for
we
can
not
prevent
him
from
going
to
live
with
the
people
of
tyame
hanutsh
with
this
girl
the
people
of
tyame
hayoue
remarked
are
good
it
is
only
that
woman
of
tyope
who
is
bad
and
after
all
she
is
not
how
would
it
do
suggested
say
to
call
sa
nashtio
hayoue
looked
at
her
like
one
to
whom
has
come
a
sudden
revelation
topanashka
the
maseua
he
said
you
are
right
koya
this
is
a
wise
thought
nashtio
is
very
wise
he
will
give
us
counsel
that
we
can
trust
but
do
you
think
he
is
here
he
was
in
his
cell
while
it
rained
hayoue
rose
i
will
go
and
call
him
he
said
he
can
help
us
zashue
listens
to
the
talk
of
the
old
man
and
what
he
says
goes
far
with
my
brother
with
this
hayoue
ere
say
could
interpose
a
word
went
out
and
left
her
alone
with
the
sleeping
child
she
felt
happy
for
years
past
she
had
not
enjoyed
the
feeling
of
contentment
of
quiet
bliss
that
filled
her
now
it
seemed
as
if
the
danger
that
threatened
her
so
direly
had
vanished
her
thoughts
were
all
with
the
future
of
the
child
whom
only
a
few
hours
ago
she
had
so
bitterly
accused
shotaye
had
worked
wonders
but
it
was
not
the
influence
of
shotaye
alone
that
produced
such
a
great
change
in
the
mind
of
say
koitza
it
was
the
fact
that
at
the
same
time
and
through
the
unwelcome
interruption
by
shyuote
the
shiuana
so
she
believed
had
sent
her
a
message
confirmatory
of
the
woman
admonition
say
did
not
she
could
not
reason
as
we
should
under
similar
circumstances
the
rainbow
of
whose
presence
the
awkward
boy
informed
her
appeared
to
her
not
in
the
natural
order
of
phenomena
but
in
the
light
of
her
creed
as
a
messenger
specially
sent
by
one
or
more
of
the
innumerable
spirits
which
surround
man
in
nature
whose
call
she
had
to
obey
implicitly
this
implicit
slavish
obedience
to
signs
and
tokens
of
a
natural
order
to
which
a
supernatural
origin
is
assigned
is
the
indian
religion
the
life
of
the
indian
is
therefore
merely
a
succession
of
religious
acts
called
forth
by
utterances
of
what
he
supposes
to
be
higher
powers
surrounding
him
and
accompanying
him
on
every
step
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
the
indian
is
a
child
whose
life
is
ruled
by
a
feeling
of
complete
dependence
by
a
desire
to
accommodate
every
action
to
the
wills
and
decrees
of
countless
supernatural
beings
in
the
eyes
of
say
koitza
the
whole
afternoon
appeared
now
like
an
uninterrupted
chain
of
dispensations
from
those
above
she
was
of
course
convinced
that
the
rain
had
come
in
response
to
the
prayers
and
ceremonies
of
yesterday
dance
that
same
rain
had
driven
shotaye
to
shelter
under
her
roof
had
given
the
an
opportunity
to
clear
the
mind
of
say
of
many
a
dismal
fear
many
a
distressing
apprehension
and
suspicion
the
rainbow
in
her
eyes
was
a
token
that
what
the
said
was
true
it
was
also
the
messenger
through
whose
agency
okoya
and
later
on
hayoue
had
drifted
into
her
home
with
cheering
tidings
even
shyuote
had
arrived
at
the
right
moment
in
time
to
be
sent
after
the
husband
and
father
so
happy
felt
say
that
in
view
of
shyuote
opportune
coming
she
almost
regretted
having
scolded
the
boy
an
intense
feeling
of
gratitude
toward
the
powers
above
filled
her
heart
among
these
powers
there
are
two
that
appear
not
so
much
superior
to
the
rest
as
more
intimately
connected
with
the
fate
of
man
as
more
directly
influencing
his
weal
and
woe
these
are
the
prominent
figures
of
the
and
his
spouse
the
it
is
principally
the
latter
that
moves
the
hearts
of
men
and
with
whom
mankind
is
in
most
constant
relations
say
koitza
felt
eager
to
thank
the
mother
above
for
all
she
had
received
that
day
she
went
to
the
recess
in
the
kitchen
wall
where
the
yaya
that
fabric
of
down
tied
into
a
graceful
bunch
of
drooping
plumage
was
carefully
stored
away
wrapped
in
a
cover
of
deerskin
she
took
out
the
plumage
and
placed
it
before
her
on
the
floor
scattered
sacred
meal
around
it
and
whispered
a
prayer
of
thanks
hardly
had
she
replaced
it
when
the
sound
of
voices
approached
the
outer
doorway
it
was
zashue
and
shyuote
who
were
coming
home
together
zashue
seemed
vexed
at
being
called
home
he
looked
around
with
a
scowl
for
hayoue
whom
he
had
expected
to
meet
was
not
there
why
did
you
call
me
koitza
he
grumbled
satyumishe
is
not
here
give
me
something
to
eat
he
threw
himself
down
on
the
floor
shyuote
nestled
by
his
side
proud
of
being
under
his
father
immediate
protection
zashue
said
to
him
have
you
eaten
sa
uishe
not
yet
why
do
you
feed
shyuote
zashue
asked
his
wife
surely
okoya
had
his
stomach
full
long
ago
whereas
this
poor
little
frog
here
this
toad
you
ought
to
call
him
say
interrupted
her
husband
in
a
tone
of
indignation
he
has
been
away
from
home
all
day
as
he
is
wont
to
be
besides
when
he
came
home
at
last
he
beat
his
little
sister
okoya
was
here
early
therefore
okoya
got
what
belonged
to
him
she
placed
the
food
on
the
floor
before
her
husband
and
proceeded
in
a
dry
tone
hayoue
has
gone
to
call
sa
nashtio
i
want
the
maseua
to
hear
what
we
have
to
say
to
you
zashue
was
surprised
at
his
wife
manner
she
spoke
in
a
way
that
betokened
more
resolution
than
he
was
wont
to
see
her
display
but
he
was
in
her
house
and
had
to
accept
the
situation
so
he
fell
to
eating
careful
all
the
while
to
supply
his
favourite
child
with
the
best
morsels
at
the
close
of
the
meal
hayoue
returned
saying
sa
nashtio
is
coming
soon
turning
to
his
brother
he
asked
where
have
you
been
all
day
satyumishe

the
naua

the
short
reply
and
you
at

to
shyuote

the
disobedient
child

is
just
what
you
shall
not
commanded
the
woman
go
out
at
once
lie
down
on
the
hides
even
the
father
became
impatient
now
for
he
saw
that
nothing
would
be
said
in
the
boy
presence
so
he
ordered
him
to
leave
slowly
and
reluctantly
shyuote
obeyed
but
when
his
sullen
glance
accidentally
met
the
eye
of
hayoue
he
accelerated
his
motions
his
uncle
was
not
a
favourite
of
his
well
what
do
you
want
why
did
you
call
me
this
query
zashue
negligently
addressed
to
his
brother
as
if
expecting
the
latter
to
inform
him
of
the
object
of
the
interview
but
it
was
say
koitza
who
undertook
the
task
of
replying
in
earnest
and
measured
tones
she
said
umo
we
have
called
and
sent
for
you
in
order
to
tell
you
that
okoya
my
child
your
son

the
girl
of
tyope
now
we
wish
to
ascertain
what
you
think
of
it
and
what
you
have
to
say
is
that
all
okoya
is
your
child
as
well
as
mine

emphatically
stated

not
be
immaterial

yawned
the
mot

for
himself
it
is
his
business
and
yours
koitza
it
does
not
concern
me
and
still
less
you
turning
to
his
brother
neither
do
i
take
part
in
it
without
request
from
okoya
answered
hayoue
sharply
but
okoya
has
spoken
to
me
about
it
and
begged
me
to
see
his
mother
in
his
behalf
i
have
therefore
a
right
to
be
here
and
to
speak
we
expect
sa
nashtio
also
the
woman
remarked
nashtio
who
tyope
zashue
looked
at
his
wife
in
surprise
tyope
say
exclaimed
he
shall
never
cross
my
threshold
i
mean
topanashka
he
shall
give
his
speech
him
we
want
and
expect
in
that
case
you
do
not
need
me
replied
zashue
attempting
to
rise
i
go
to
my
people
hayoue
touched
his
arm
satyumishe
he
said
gravely
it
is
not
well
for
you
to
leave
us
now
we
must
speak
with
you
more
it
is
none
of
my
business
growled
the
elder
brother
and
yet
you
must
hear
about
it
for
mitsha
is
a
daughter
of
the
koshare
she
is
not
koshare
herself
her
mother
only
and
tyame
hanutsh
are
entitled
to
speak
zashue
was
becoming
impatient
hachshtze
say
interfered
i
know
that
you
are
not
fond
of
okoya
still
he
is
good
far
better
than
shyuote
interjected
the
younger
brother
she
continued
but
mark
my
words
is
it
right
that
our
child
should
go
to
the
house
where
dwells
the
wife
of
a
man
who
for
a
long
time
past
has
sought
to
torment
me
who
harbours
toward
my
hanutsh
and
your
hanutsh
and
who
notwithstanding
that
you
believe
him
to
be
your
friend
and
are
more
attached
to
him
than
you
are
to
your
wife
and
child
is
not
your
friend
at
all
zashue
was
visibly
impressed
by
these
words
of
his
wife
was
she
perhaps
aware
of
the
secret
motives
of
the
upturning
of
her
household
which
he
and
tyope
had
performed
yesterday
he
could
hardly
imagine
that
she
could
know
anything
about
it
and
yet
her
utterances
intimated
some
occurrence
of
the
past
that
had
opened
a
wide
breach
forever
between
her
and
tyope
might
not
that
occurrence
have
prompted
the
latter
to
his
accusation
against
say
this
was
an
entirely
new
idea
to
him
and
while
he
felt
ashamed
of
having
yielded
to
tyope
against
his
own
wife
he
now
began
to
suspect
the
real
motives
which
inspired
the
man
in
his
denunciations
he
replied
hastily
i
am
not
with
tyope
he
is
your
best
friend
hayoue
objected
that
is
not
true
hachshtze
say
said
in
a
tone
of
serious
reminder
speak
not
thus
i
know
that
you
and
tyope
are
good
to
each
other
i
know
that
he
gives
you
advice
and
i
know
too
her
voice
rose
and
grew
solemn
that
you
have
told
him
many
things
which
neither
tzitz
hanutsh
nor
tanyi
hanutsh
like
him
to
know
tyope
is
wise
and
he
is
also
very
bad
the
younger
brother
exclaimed
this
made
zashue
angry
if
he
is
such
a
bad
man
why
do
you
want
to
throw
away
okoya
that
jewel
he
said
with
a
grin
of
irony
on
that
bad
man
daughter
it
seems
that
you
have
called
me
in
only
in
order
to
slander
the
best
of
my
brethren
i
am
koshare
and
will
remain
koshare
whether
it
pleases
you
koitza
or
not
the
mot
tza
here
alluding
to
hayoue
has
still
less
to
say
about
it
he
is
cuirana
and
has
his
people
i
am
koshare
and
have
my
people
okoya
may
do
as
he
pleases
if
he
thinks
that
his
father
brother
is
nearer
to
him
than
his
father
himself
let
him
believe
it
forever
now
let
me
alone
and
as
to
his
makatza
do
as
you
please
i
will
return
to
my
brethren
he
rose
angrily
and
went
out
hayoue
shook
his
head
and
looked
sad
say
drew
a
suppressed
sigh
and
stared
before
her
in
silence
after
a
while
she
rose
and
fed
the
fire
and
a
more
vivid
glow
spread
over
the
room
where
both
sat
again
motionless
absorbed
by
their
own
thoughts
a
shuffling
sound
was
heard
outside
a
muffled
step
in
the
outer
room
then
the
woman
father
entered
the
kitchen
with
the
usual
salutation
spoken
in
a
hoarse
voice
guatzena
he
sat
down
near
the
hearth
where
his
daughter
had
placed
a
deerskin
for
him
holding
both
hands
up
to
the
fire
his
quick
glance
shot
from
one
of
those
present
to
the
other
scanning
the
expression
of
their
features
then
he
asked
quietly
where
is
zashue
he
went
to
the
koshare
hayoue
explained
why
did
you
call
me
say
answered
in
a
meek
submissive
manner
we
wished
to
speak
to
you
nashtio
for
okoya
my
child
has
told
me
something
that
may
be
good
although
it
may
also
not
be
good
it
is
something
i
like
to
see
and
yet
it
also
makes
my
heart
heavy
he
has
spoken
about
it
to
satyumishe
too
she
nodded
at
hayoue
before
he
said
anything
to
me
therefore
hayoue
came
to
see
me
and
we
thought
it
would
be
well
to
seek
your
advice
for
umo
you
are
wise
and
we
are
foolish
you
are
old
and
we
are
but
children
therefore
listen
to
our
speech
kindly
and
then
open
our
hearts
with
your
speech
as
a
father
should
with
his
children
the
old
man
was
flattered
by
this
address
from
his
daughter
and
glanced
at
hayoue
with
the
air
of
one
who
feels
proud
of
the
achievements
of
his
child
the
young
man
too
bowed
in
approbation
topanashka
turned
to
say
and
said
in
an
affable
tone
speak
sa
uishe
i
am
glad
to
listen
sa
nashtio
she
began
okoya
is
young
but
he
is
no
longer
a
child
his
eyes
have
seen
a
girl
and
that
girl
has
pleased
his
heart
so
he
has
gone
to
that
girl
and
may
be
with
her
at
present
i
hold
this
to
be
good
umo
what
do
you
think
it
is
well
and
it
is
good
for
him
and
for
the
tribe
the
old
man
asserted
afterward
he
came
and
said
i
am
going
with
that
makatza
does
she
please
you
i
believe
that
was
right
also
it
was
right
the
woman
omitted
the
incident
of
her
quarrel
with
okoya
as
well
as
her
interview
with
shotaye
and
said
he
also
went
to
hayoue
and
told
him
to
speak
to
me
for
him
was
that
right
sa
nashtio
the
old
man
remained
thoughtful
for
a
while
and
then
declared
it
was
right
should
he
not
have
said
to
his
father
nashtio
do
you
speak
to
the
yaya
for
me
the
reply
was
very
positive
no
why
not
sa
umo
hayoue
interjected
i
will
explain
this
to
you
later
on
topanashka
answered
turning
to
his
daughter
again
he
inquired
who
is
the
makatza
and
to
which
hanutsh
does
she
belong
she
belongs
to
your
people
to
tyame
who
is
her
mother
and
what
is
the
name
of
the
girl
she
is
called
mitsha
koitza
tyope
tihua
is
her
father
and
her
mother
you
know
too
is
all
that
good
also
the
maseua
pressed
his
lips
together
firmly
energetically
lowered
his
eyelids
and
gazed
before
him
in
silence
the
others
exchanged
a
rapid
glance
and
then
both
looked
at
the
ground
remaining
thus
in
expectation
of
the
old
man
reply
he
kept
silent
for
a
long
while
at
last
he
inquired
of
the
woman
do
you
know
the
child
i
have
seen
her
but
have
never
spoken
to
her
do
you
know
her
he
turned
to
hayoue
why
not
replied
hayoue
with
a
smile
i
know
everybody
who
wears
a
petticoat
have
you
been
to
see
her
no
never
topanashka
looked
at
him
suspiciously
no
how
can
you
know
her
then
as
i
know
all
the
others
by
meeting
them
out
of
doors
talking
and
playing
with
them
i
know
them
all
all
and
the
beau
of
the
rito
yawned
complacently
and
stretched
himself
is
she
a
good
girl
continued
topanashka
she
is
the
youth
replied
emphatically
does
she
talk
much
no
is
she
easily
angered
that
i
do
know
i
have
never
teased
her
is
she
a
good
worker
so
they
say
raua
raua
hayoue
exclaimed
tall
yes
strong
i
believe
so
topanashka
became
silent
again
and
both
say
and
hayoue
observed
the
proper
decorum
by
fastening
their
glances
on
the
floor
in
silence
then
the
old
man
raised
his
head
and
spoke
slowly
and
in
solemn
tones
it
is
well
all
you
have
said
to
me
is
well
my
children
the
daughter
of
my
hanutsh
is
a
good
girl
she
is
a
handsome
girl
she
is
a
strong
girl
therefore
she
is
as
a
woman
ought
to
be
okoya
is
like
her
they
belong
to
each
other
and
it
is
wise
for
a
son
of
tanyi
to
wed
a
daughter
of
tyame
the
body
must
be
as
the
heart
each
must
suit
the
heart
and
the
body
of
the
other
and
since
the
two
go
with
each
other
it
is
a
sign
that
they
are
fitted
to
live
together
but
the
hearts
of
men
must
abide
by
what
those
above
he
pointed
upward
command
and
before
we
decide
we
should
ascertain
how
the
shiuana
are
disposed
here
say
interrupted
him
and
suggested
when
he
was
coming
to
speak
to
me
the
rainbow
stood
in
the
skies
is
not
that
a
sign
that
the
shiuana
are
with
my
child
topanashka
smiled
a
kind
benignant
smile
and
said
it
is
right
to
think
thus
sa
uishe
but
remember
that
the
rainbow
is
a
messenger
to
a
great
many
and
for
many
purposes
as
long
as
we
have
not
asked
the
shiuana
themselves
we
can
not
say
we
do
not
know
whether
they
approve
or
not
i
shall
therefore
go
to
the
yaya
of
our
tribe
and
ask
them
to
pray
to
those
above
that
they
may
let
them
know
if
what
we
now
treat
of
is
good
or
not
for
as
long
as
p
yatyama
himself
does
not
connect
the
paths
of
the
two
young
people
all
our
doings
are
in
vain
in
the
meantime
do
not
hinder
okoya
from
seeing
the
girl
and
when
i
come
to
you
with
the
answer
from
those
above
and
that
answer
is
favourable
then
say
go
you
to
the
people
of
the
eagle
and
say
to
them
son
asks
for
your
daughter
in
order
that
your
numbers
may
be
increased
i
myself
like
to
see
the
blood
of
my
children
flow
in
that
of
mine
own
hayoue
and
his
looked
at
each
other
in
mute
admiration
at
this
speech
which
to
them
appeared
so
wise
so
thoroughly
appropriate
topanashka
went
on
you
have
told
me
that
mitsha
is
the
child
of
tyope
that
it
is
true
is
not
good
but
if
okoya
is
strong
and
if
mitsha
is
true
to
him
what
can
tyope
do
he
belongs
to
his
hanutsh
his
daughter
to
hers
and
the
people
of
tyame
have
no
faith
in
those
of
shyuamo
for
they
mistrust
them
but
warn
the
mot
tza
tell
him
to
be
prudent
for
tyope
is
cunning
as
cunning
as
shutzuna
and
as
treacherous
as
the
wildcat
and
my
grandson
is
young
but
let
them
go
together
for
i
am
glad
to
see
tyame
and
tanyi
become
one
often
was
the
admiring
and
affirmative
ejaculation
of
both
his
listeners
every
word
he
had
spoken
was
according
to
their
convictions
and
besides
whatever
he
said
was
law
to
them
hayoue
rose
breathed
on
the
hand
of
the
old
man
said
tro
uashatze
umo
and
left
after
his
departure
topanashka
also
rose
but
before
crossing
the
threshold
he
whispered
to
say
they
found
nothing
nothing
was
tyope
along
he
was
in
that
case
they
may
accuse
you
as
much
as
they
please
they
can
not
do
you
any
harm
but
who
could
have
told
them
that
i
do
not
know
and
can
not
know
but
rest
easy
you
are
safe
with
these
words
he
left
the
dwelling
and
returned
to
his
own
abode
where
his
deaf
consort
was
already
asleep
the
fire
had
gone
out
it
was
dark
in
his
humble
home
still
topanashka
did
not
go
to
rest
but
sat
down
in
a
corner
and
mused
he
felt
happy
in
the
thought
that
okoya
and
mitsha
might
become
united
it
caused
him
pleasure
that
his
grandson
should
wed
a
child
of
his
own
clan
still
with
his
strong
attachment
to
the
faith
or
creed
in
which
he
was
born
he
would
not
yield
to
his
own
wishes
until
the
will
of
the
higher
powers
was
ascertained
to
that
end
he
was
resolved
to
apply
to
the
leading
shamans
of
the
tribe
in
order
however
that
the
shiuana
might
look
favourably
upon
his
request
he
determined
upon
doing
penance
himself
during
four
consecutive
days
until
this
was
performed
he
would
not
even
speak
to
the
the
he
thus
imposed
was
to
be
light
and
not
a
formal
fast
it
limited
itself
to
a
much
less
substantial
nourishment
and
to
a
shorter
rest
during
the
hours
of
night
footnotes

in
the
symbolical
paintings

represented
usually
as

chapter
x
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
speaking
the
chief
civil
officer
of
the
tribe
at
the
rito
its
tapop
or
as
he
is
now
called
governor
was
an
indian
whose
name
was
hoshkanyi
tihua
hoshkanyi
tihua
was
a
man
of
small
stature
his
head
was
nearly
round
or
rather
for
the
lower
jaw
appeared
to
be
broader
than
the
forehead
the
lips
were
thin
and
the
mouth
firmly
set
the
nose
small
and
aquiline
the
eyes
had
usually
a
pleasant
expression
but
when
the
little
man
got
excited
they
sparkled
in
a
manner
that
denoted
not
merely
an
irascible
temper
but
a
disposition
to
become
extremely
venomous
in
speech
and
utterance
hoshkanyi
tihua
was
nimble
and
a
good
hunter
he
seldom
returned
from
a
hunt
without
a
supply
of
game
on
such
occasions
he
was
always
suitably
welcomed
by
his
wife
who
suffered
him
to
skin
the
animal
and
cut
up
the
body
when
that
was
performed
she
allowed
her
husband
to
go
to
rest
but
not
before
for
koay
hoshkanyi
wife
was
not
so
much
his
companion
in
life
as
his
and
however
valiant
the
little
fellow
might
try
to
appear
outside
of
his
home
once
under
the
immediate
influence
of
that
home
particular
mistress
he
became
as
meek
as
a
lamb
koay
was
an
unusually
tall
woman
for
an
indian
she
overtopped
her
husband
by
nearly
a
head
and
the
result
of
this
anomalous
difference
in
size
was
that
hoshkanyi
felt
very
much
afraid
of
her
koay
had
a
temper
of
her
own
besides
which
temper
she
occasionally
displayed
at
the
expense
of
the
little
tapop
bodily
comfort
among
the
pueblo
indians
the
wife
is
by
no
means
the
slave
only
of
the
lord
of
creation
koshkanyi
had
somehow
or
other
acquired
the
reputation
of
being
an
experienced
warrior
whether
he
really
deserved
that
reputation
or
not
was
never
accurately
ascertained
at
all
events
he
was
the
lucky
possessor
of
one
scalp
and
that
gave
him
prestige
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
acquired
the
trophy
in
a
legitimate
way
that
is
he
had
not
stolen
it
once
upon
a
time
a
of
navajos
infested
the
avenues
to
the
rito
they
succeeded
in
killing
a
defenceless
indian
who
had
wandered
from
the
bottom
of
the
gorge
and
whom
they
found
on
the
mesas
somewhere
wending
his
way
back
to
the
homes
of
his
tribe
after
the
fact
became
known
a
party
went
out
to
take
revenge
and
it
so
happened
that
there
was
deep
snow
and
the
murderers
could
easily
be
trailed
on
the
top
of
what
is
called
the
potrero
viejo
the
avengers
surprised
the
navajos
fast
asleep
it
was
bitterly
cold
and
evil
tongues
affirmed
that
the
navajo
whose
scalp
hoshkanyi
tihua
brought
home
had
been
frozen
to
death
previous
to
the
arrival
of
the
hero
from
the
tyuonyi
however
that
may
be
our
governor
returned
with
one
scalp
and
he
was
declared
to
be
manslayer
and
henceforth
counted
among
the
influential
braves
of
his
community
hoshkanyi
tihua
was
by
no
means
silly
he
possessed
the
valuable
faculty
of
keeping
his
mouth
closed
and
of
holding
his
tongue
under
circumstances
when
it
would
be
disadvantageous
to
him
to
speak
this
faculty
had
been
inculcated
after
long
and
earnest
training
by
his
great
wife
whenever
there
was
no
danger
hoshkanyi
proved
very
outspoken
but
as
soon
as
there
was
the
slightest
sign
of
active
opposition
he
became
extremely
wise
and
shrouded
his
views
in
a
cloud
of
dignified
gravity
in
addition
to
these
qualities
hoshkanyi
was
the
happy
owner
of
an
unlimited
amount
of
personal
vanity
his
ambition
had
no
definite
object
provided
some
external
authority
was
associated
with
his
person
after
having
for
a
long
time
fulfilled
the
rather
insignificant
office
of
assistant
to
the
governor
of
the
tribe
his
ambition
at
last
became
gratified
with
the
announcement
that
after
the
governor
demise
the
hotshanyi
or
chief
penitent
and
his
associates
had
designated
him
as
the
incumbent
of
the
office
so
hoshkanyi
tihua
rose
suddenly
to
the
rank
of
one
of
the
chief
dignitaries
of
his
commonwealth
the
choice
thus
made
by
the
religious
heads
of
the
queres
did
not
satisfy
everybody
but
everybody
was
convinced
that
those
above
had
spoken
through
the
mediums
to
whose
care
the
relations
between
mankind
and
the
higher
powers
were
specially
committed
everybody
therefore
accepted
the
nomination
and
the
council
confirmed
it
at
once
the
majority
of
the
clans
opposed
hoshkanyi
because
he
belonged
to
the
turquoise
people
who
were
rendering
themselves
obnoxious
to
many
by
pretensions
which
they
upheld
by
means
of
their
number
and
by
their
connection
with
the
leader
of
the
koshare
the
turquoise
clan
was
beginning
to
assert
in
tribal
affairs
an
unusual
influence
one
that
really
amounted
to
a
pressure
tyame
and
tanyi
particularly
felt
this
growing
power
of
shyuamo
at
the
expense
of
their
influence
of
all
the
less
numerous
groups
tzitz
hanutsh
was
almost
the
only
one
who
took
the
side
of
tanyi
under
all
circumstances
and
this
was
due
exclusively
to
the
fact
that
the
marriage
of
zashue
with
say
koitza
bound
the
two
clans
together
topanashka
himself
was
a
member
of
the
eagle
clan
and
through
him
the
water
clan
feeble
in
numbers
enjoyed
the
support
not
only
of
tanyi
but
also
of
tyame
hanutsh
in
proposing
for
the
vacant
position
of
tapop
a
member
of
the
turquoise
people
the
chief
penitents
had
in
a
measure
acted
discreetly
they
certainly
acted
very
impartially
or
they
considered
that
already
one
important
office
the
office
of
maseua
or
was
held
by
a
member
of
one
of
the
most
numerous
hanutsh
tyame
it
appeared
unwise
to
them
to
refuse
to
as
large
a
cluster
as
shyuamo
an
adequate
representation
in
the
executive
powers
of
the
community
so
they
chose
hoshkanyi
as
a
member
of
the
turquoise
clan
and
proposed
him
for
the
office
of
tapop
or
civil
chief
that
more
opposition
was
not
made
to
this
selection
was
due
to
two
facts
first
to
the
tacit
acknowledgment
on
the
part
of
all
that
it
seemed
fair
to
give
shyuamo
a
share
in
the
tribal
government
and
second
to
the
equally
tacit
conviction
that
hoshkanyi
while
in
appearance
a
man
of
determination
and
perspicacity
was
in
fact
but
a
pompous
and
weak
individual
ambitious
and
vain
and
without
the
faculty
of
doing
harm
in
both
these
points
public
opinion
at
the
rito
was
right
it
will
be
seen
from
what
has
been
said
that
there
prevailed
a
strong
desire
on
the
part
of
the
chief
religious
authorities
to
preserve
a
certain
equilibrium
between
the
components
of
the
tribe
that
anxiety
to
maintain
an
even
balance
of
power
was
in
itself
evidence
of
danger
that
this
equilibrium
might
be
disturbed
the
great
penitents
or
as
they
are
erroneously
called
caciques
had
not
and
could
not
have
any
clear
conception
of
the
condition
of
affairs
in
the
government
of
their
people
men
old
even
prematurely
old
from
the
effects
of
the
life
of
constant
abnegation
and
to
which
they
had
to
resign
themselves
excluded
from
listening
to
anything
that
was
or
might
indicate
strife
and
contention
they
knew
not
what
was
going
on
under
cover
of
apparent
harmony
theoretically
and
from
the
standpoint
of
their
duty
which
consisted
in
praying
and
suffering
for
the
peace
and
happiness
of
the
community
and
thus
securing
these
boons
by
means
of
more
direct
intercourse
with
those
above
their
choice
was
excellent
practically
it
was
the
most
dangerous
step
that
could
have
been
suggested
and
carried
out
they
did
not
consider
that
instead
of
giving
to
shyuamo
a
legitimate
share
in
the
government
of
the
tribe
they
virtually
gave
the
turquoise
people
a
majority
for
the
latter
had
already
two
representatives
of
great
influence
tyope
was
delegate
to
the
council
where
he
represented
his
clan
and
the
koshare
naua
who
also
was
a
member
of
shyuamo
not
only
belonged
to
the
leading
councilmen
but
was
one
of
the
religious
heads
by
adding
hoshkanyi
as
tapop
it
gave
the
turquoise
clan
an
unfair
preponderance
for
while
hoshkanyi
was
a
weak
man
while
he
was
mortally
afraid
of
his
inflexibly
honest
colleague
the
maseua
topanashka
he
was
dependent
upon
tyope
and
upon
the
chief
of
the
delight
makers
because
both
belonged
to
his
clan
he
very
soon
began
to
display
an
utter
flexibility
to
the
desires
of
the
two
individuals
to
the
disadvantage
of
those
who
did
not
coincide
with
their
views
this
marked
preponderance
of
shyuamo
in
tribal
affairs
aroused
apprehensions
on
the
part
of
the
other
strong
clans
it
also
caused
the
greater
number
of
the
weaker
clusters
to
gravitate
toward
the
growing
element
of
power
held
by
the
turquoise
people
a
schism
was
slowly
and
imperceptibly
preparing
itself
among
the
people
of
the
rito
that
schism
was
not
the
work
of
circumstances
it
was
being
systematically
prepared
by
two
crafty
men
tyope
and
the
koshare
naua
illustration
juanico
a
member
of
the
modern
in
working
at
such
a
division
these
two
men
had
in
view
objects
their
aim
in
itself
was
not
absolutely
illegitimate
since
it
foreshadowed
what
would
be
an
inevitable
necessity
in
the
course
of
time
what
rendered
their
doings
reprehensible
and
positively
odious
were
the
means
employed
to
hasten
events
their
object
was
nothing
less
than
to
expel
a
part
of
the
people
for
the
exclusive
benefit
of
the
remainder
the
extent
of
land
that
can
be
cultivated
in
the
gorge
of
the
rito
is
small
and
the
tribe
was
growing
in
numbers
the
time
was
sure
to
come
when
the
crops
would
no
longer
be
adequate
for
all
furthermore
a
positive
danger
threatened
the
people
in
their
dwellings
the
rock
being
extremely
friable
crumbled
constantly
and
now
and
then
inhabited
caves
were
falling
a
prey
to
the
wear
and
tear
of
the
material
in
which
they
had
been
excavated
as
this
slow
decay
was
sure
to
continue
it
was
logical
to
expect
that
room
must
be
found
for
the
houseless
outside
already
the
corn
clan
had
been
compelled
to
build
a
house
in
the
bottom
of
the
valley
all
this
further
tended
to
curtail
the
space
for
agriculture
and
rendered
a
diminution
of
numbers
prospectively
imperative
these
facts
had
been
recognized
by
tyope
and
he
had
talked
with
the
koshare
naua
about
them
for
some
time
past
they
were
the
only
persons
who
had
thought
of
them
not
so
much
deploring
the
necessity
arising
therefrom
in
the
future
as
hailing
them
as
welcome
pretexts
for
their
immediate
personal
aims
neither
tyope
nor
the
naua
had
such
high
ambition
as
to
aspire
to
a
change
of
the
basis
of
social
organization
neither
of
them
had
any
conception
of
government
but
what
was
purely
tribal
but
they
both
aspired
to
offices
and
dignities
such
as
tribal
organization
alone
knows
these
seemed
unattainable
for
them
as
long
as
there
were
other
powerful
clans
at
the
rito
besides
their
own
whereas
in
case
some
of
the
former
were
expelled
it
would
leave
vacant
and
at
their
disposal
the
positions
which
they
coveted
tyope
for
instance
looked
forward
to
the
dignity
of
head
or
maseua
but
as
long
as
topanashka
lived
he
saw
no
chance
for
himself
he
therefore
concocted
with
the
young
navajo
the
sinister
plan
of
murdering
the
old
man
it
was
even
uncertain
in
presence
of
the
two
powerful
clans
of
tanyi
and
tyame
whether
after
the
death
of
topanashka
it
would
be
possible
for
him
to
secure
the
succession
for
the
chief
penitents
who
selected
officially
the
new
incumbent
while
they
were
in
no
manner
accessible
to
outside
influence
might
consider
the
general
tendency
of
affairs
and
for
the
same
reasons
that
they
chose
hoshkanyi
tihua
for
tapop
might
determine
upon
appointing
some
member
of
tanyi
or
tyame
as
maseua
tyope
had
foreseen
such
a
contingency
and
had
therefore
suggested
to
nacaytzusle
the
propriety
of
converting
the
isolated
murder
into
a
butchery
of
the
adult
men
as
far
as
possible
his
suggestion
to
surprise
the
rito
while
the
koshare
were
at
work
in
their
estufa
had
a
double
aim
in
the
first
place
it
made
it
less
dangerous
for
the
navajos
in
the
second
it
appointed
a
time
when
most
of
the
men
of
the
turquoise
clan
were
out
of
reach
of
an
enemy
the
blow
must
then
fall
upon
the
males
of
other
clans
for
the
majority
of
the
koshare
were
from
the
people
of
shyuamo
this
plan
was
out
of
the
question
since
the
night
when
his
negotiations
with
nacaytzusle
had
come
to
such
a
disastrous
termination
but
tyope
had
laid
his
wires
in
other
directions
also
seeing
that
he
could
not
reduce
the
numbers
of
the
tribe
by
one
fell
blow
or
that
at
least
his
endeavours
might
not
succeed
he
was
devising
in
his
peculiar
underhand
way
means
to
create
a
disunion
and
trying
to
secure
for
the
time
of
the
crisis
a
commanding
position
for
his
own
clan
as
he
could
never
have
attempted
all
this
alone
he
needed
an
associate
an
accomplice
that
accomplice
he
readily
found
in
the
old
koshare
naua
in
the
same
manner
that
tyope
aspired
to
the
position
of
the
chief
of
the
delight
makers
was
coveting
the
rank
of
leading
shaman
or
not
the
dignity
of
cacique
for
that
position
entailed
too
many
personal
sacrifices
and
carried
with
it
a
life
of
seclusion
and
retirement
that
presented
no
redeeming
features
but
the
office
of
hishtanyi
chayan
or
principal
was
what
the
naua
desired
to
obtain
that
position
did
not
entail
greater
privations
than
the
one
which
the
old
schemer
occupied
but
it
secured
for
its
incumbent
much
greater
sway
over
the
people
and
placed
him
in
the
position
to
exert
a
degree
of
influence
which
was
beyond
the
pale
of
koshare
magic
the
naua
was
working
toward
his
end
by
ways
and
with
means
different
from
those
employed
by
tyope
his
machinations
were
directed
against
the
religious
heads
of
the
tribe
and
he
persisted
in
securing
for
the
society
of
delight
makers
a
prominence
that
lay
outside
of
their
real
attributes
therefore
hayoue
did
not
speak
amiss
when
in
his
interview
with
okoya
he
accused
the
koshare
and
principally
their
leader
of
attempting
to
usurp
functions
and
rights
belonging
properly
to
the
main
official
shamans
and
thus
secure
for
themselves
undue
advantages
tyope
and
the
old
naua
had
found
each
other
in
accordance
with
the
proverb
about
birds
of
a
feather
their
understanding
was
perfect
although
it
had
been
brought
about
gradually
and
without
the
formality
of
a
conspiracy
each
worked
in
his
own
line
and
with
his
own
means
and
neither
had
any
thought
of
going
beyond
what
the
tribal
organization
could
give
them
there
was
no
idea
of
revolutionizing
or
even
reforming
the
organization
had
one
of
them
entertained
such
a
thought
the
other
would
have
become
his
bitterest
enemy
for
both
were
deeply
imbued
with
the
principles
on
which
rested
the
existence
of
the
society
in
which
they
had
been
born
all
they
aspired
to
was
to
eliminate
a
certain
number
of
men
or
people
in
order
to
secure
with
greater
ease
certain
advantages
it
was
the
survival
of
the
fittest
as
primitive
society
understands
it
and
as
refined
society
attempts
to
enact
though
with
more
refined
means
the
in
the
path
of
these
intriguers
were
the
chief
penitents
the
cacique
or
as
their
titles
run
the
hotshanyi
or
principal
cacique
and
his
two
assistants
the
uishtyaka
and
the
shaykatze
these
men
selected
for
the
purpose
of
doing
penance
for
all
and
thus
obtaining
readier
access
to
the
ear
of
the
immortal
ones
were
the
official
keepers
of
peace
among
the
tribe
for
the
indian
feels
that
a
house
divided
against
itself
can
not
stand
and
that
the
maintenance
of
harmony
through
a
constant
appeal
to
the
higher
powers
is
the
most
important
feature
in
the
life
of
his
tribe
to
discredit
in
an
underhand
way
the
caciques
was
the
special
aim
of
the
koshare
naua
and
to
direct
the
eyes
of
the
people
to
his
own
achievements
in
religious
magic
in
one
word
to
place
the
power
of
the
koshare
and
their
specific
medicine
on
a
higher
plane
than
all
that
the
official
penitents
might
achieve
to
do
this
was
a
very
slow
piece
of
work
and
it
had
to
be
brought
about
in
such
a
manner
that
nobody
could
suspect
his
object
but
both
tyope
and
the
aged
scoundrel
were
working
their
plans
with
the
utmost
caution
and
the
religious
heads
of
the
tribe
had
not
the
slightest
suspicion
of
what
was
going
on
against
them
the
tyuonyi
therefore
was
quiet
on
the
surface
but
there
were
occasional
ripples
of
that
placid
brook
which
earnest
and
thoughtful
observers
could
not
fail
to
notice
hayoue
although
very
young
was
one
of
these
observers
but
none
saw
more
and
penetrated
deeper
into
the
real
state
of
affairs
than
topanashka
he
and
the
hishtanyi
chayan
who
to
some
extent
was
his
trusty
friend
felt
that
a
tempest
was
coming
both
saw
that
the
disturbing
powers
were
rooted
in
the
society
of
the
koshare
that
tyope
and
the
naua
must
be
the
leading
spirits
but
how
and
to
what
ultimate
end
the
machinations
were
intended
escaped
their
penetration
for
the
same
reason
they
could
not
come
actively
to
the
relief
of
the
situation
as
no
overt
action
had
as
yet
been
committed
which
would
justify
an
official
movement
against
the
conspirators
topanashka
had
for
several
days
been
keeping
the
informal
fast
upon
which
he
had
determined
for
the
benefit
of
his
grandson
wooing
it
was
a
warm
pleasant
afternoon
since
the
rain
which
followed
upon
the
ayash
tyucotz
the
sky
had
been
blue
again
as
before
the
season
for
daily
showers
had
not
yet
commenced
and
the
people
were
in
the
as
busy
as
possible
improving
the
bright
days
in
weeding
and
putting
the
ground
in
order
the
bottom
of
the
gorge
therefore
presented
an
active
appearance
men
and
women
moved
about
the
houses
in
and
out
of
the
and
in
the
fields
from
the
tasselled
corn
that
grew
in
these
plots
a
tall
figure
emerged
it
was
topanashka
himself
and
he
directed
his
steps
toward
the
cliffs
at
the
lower
end
where
the
turquoise
people
dwelt
the
old
man
moved
as
usual
with
a
silent
measured
step
which
would
have
appeared
stately
had
not
his
head
leaned
forward
he
was
clad
in
a
wrap
of
unbleached
cotton
and
a
leather
belt
girded
his
loins
around
his
neck
a
string
of
crystals
of
feldspar
was
negligently
thrown
and
a
fetich
of
white
alabaster
representing
rudely
the
form
of
a
panther
depended
from
the
necklace
hanging
upon
his
breast
the
people
of
the
turquoise
or
shyuamo
resided
on
the
lower
range
of
cliffs
and
formed
the
most
easterly
group
of
on
the
rito
here
the
rocks
are
no
longer
absolutely
perpendicular
they
form
steps
and
the
slope
leading
to
them
is
overgrown
with
shrubbery
except
where
erosive
action
of
wind
as
well
as
of
water
or
frost
has
scooped
out
strange
formations
in
advance
of
the
main
wall
these
erosions
are
mostly
regular
cones
between
and
behind
which
open
chasms
and
deep
rents
like
the
one
above
which
as
we
recollect
lies
the
estufa
of
the
koshare
topanashka
walked
toward
the
upper
part
of
the
cluster
of
dwellings
of
shyuamo
where
the
ascending
slope
was
sparsely
covered
with
brush
in
front
of
one
of
the
caves
sat
a
woman
she
was
unusually
tall
for
an
indian
and
neither
young
nor
old
she
appeared
to
be
busy
extracting
the
filaments
from
shrivelled
leaves
of
the
yucca
which
had
been
dried
by
roasting
and
afterward
had
been
buried
to
allow
the
texture
to
decay
so
engrossed
was
the
woman
by
her
task
that
only
when
the
old
man
stood
by
her
side
and
asked
where
is
the
tapop
did
she
notice
his
presence
koay
for
it
was
she
the
towering
consort
of
the
governor
of
the
tyuonyi
did
not
condescend
to
reply
in
words
to
the
inquiry
of
the
she
resorted
to
a
lazy
pantomime
by
gathering
her
two
lips
to
a
projection
and
thrusting
this
protuberance
forward
in
the
direction
of
the
doorway
before
which
she
was
squatting
then
she
resumed
her
occupation
the
visitor
paid
no
further
attention
to
the
uncivil
woman
he
passed
in
front
of
her
unceremoniously
and
entered
the
cave
the
apartment
was
like
those
we
have
previously
described
with
the
single
difference
that
it
was
better
lighted
somewhat
larger
and
that
the
household
effects
scattered
and
hung
around
were
of
a
different
character
implements
of
warfare
a
bow
and
a
quiver
with
arrows
a
shield
convex
and
painted
red
with
a
yellow
disk
and
several
green
lines
in
the
centre
were
suspended
from
the
wall
the
niches
contained
small
vessels
of
burnt
clay
and
a
few
a
low
doorway
led
from
this
room
into
another
and
beyond
that
there
was
even
a
third
cell
so
that
hoshkanyi
tihua
the
civil
chief
of
the
queres
enjoyed
the
luxury
of
occupying
three
apartments
still
this
was
not
the
dwelling
which
he
commonly
inhabited
his
wife
descended
from
the
bear
clan
and
her
home
and
consequently
his
also
was
higher
up
the
gorge
among
the
caves
belonging
to
the
people
of
the
bear
but
as
his
father
had
recently
departed
this
life
and
his
mother
was
left
alone
she
had
begged
her
only
son
to
remain
with
her
until
one
or
the
other
of
her
brothers
or
sisters
might
be
ready
to
take
her
in
charge
either
by
moving
into
her
abode
or
by
her
going
to
them
hoshkanyi
therefore
had
temporarily
gone
to
live
with
his
mother
but
his
portly
consort
was
careful
not
to
let
him
go
alone
they
had
no
children
and
she
felt
constrained
to
keep
an
eye
upon
the
little
man
in
the
room
which
topanashka
had
entered
his
executive
colleague
was
sitting
on
a
round
piece
of
wood
a
low
upright
cylinder
whose
upper
surface
was
slightly
hollowed
out
such
were
the
chairs
of
the
pueblos
in
olden
times
with
the
exception
of
that
garment
peculiar
to
indians
and
babies
and
called
the
governor
manly
form
was
not
concealed
by
any
vestment
whatever
but
while
he
evidently
thought
that
at
home
the
necessities
of
costume
might
be
dispensed
with
he
had
not
abandoned
the
luxuries
of
ornamentation
he
wore
on
his
naked
body
a
necklace
of
wolves
teeth
ear
pendants
of
black
and
green
stones
and
wristbands
of
red
leather
the
latter
he
carried
in
order
to
relieve
his
heart
still
heavy
under
the
severe
blow
that
he
had
experienced
through
the
death
of
his
father
the
tapop
was
also
at
work
by
means
of
the
he
was
attempting
to
perforate
a
diminutive
shell
disk
and
thus
transform
it
into
the
shell
bead
so
essential
to
the
indian
so
intent
was
he
upon
this
arduous
task
that
he
failed
to
notice
the
coming
of
topanashka
and
the
latter
stood
beside
him
for
a
little
while
an
impassive
observer
at
last
hoshkanyi
tihua
looked
up
and
the
visitor
said
to
him
umo
you
have
sent
for
me
and
i
have
come
but
if
you
are
engaged
or
have
no
time
now
i
do
not
mind
returning
again
there
was
a
decided
irony
in
the
manner
in
which
the
old
man
uttered
these
words
and
hoskanyi
felt
it
he
rose
quickly
gathered
a
few
robes
and
spread
them
on
the
ground
in
short
he
was
as
pleasant
and
accommodating
all
at
once
as
he
and
his
wife
had
been
careless
in
the
beginning
topanashka
settled
down
on
the
hides
and
in
the
meantime
the
woman
also
entered
the
room
and
quite
unceremoniously
squatted
beside
the
men
hoshkanyi
said
to
her
we
have
to
talk
together
the
maseua
and
i
he
fastened
on
his
spouse
a
look
timid
and
imploring
it
was
plain
that
he
did
not
venture
to
send
her
out
directly
that
he
was
afraid
of
her
koay
looked
at
him
carelessly
and
said
in
a
very
cool
manner
i
want
to
hear
that
talk
but
i
will
not
allow
it
interposed
topanashka
and
his
cold
piercing
eye
rested
on
the
woman
face
she
cast
hers
to
the
ground
and
he
proceeded
as
long
as
you
are
here
the
tapop
and
i
can
not
speak
she
lifted
her
head
angrily
with
the
manifest
intention
of
rebelling
but
as
soon
as
her
eyes
met
the
cold
determined
glance
of
the
she
felt
a
chill
rose
and
left
the
room
hoshkanyi
tihua
drew
a
sigh
of
relief
he
was
grateful
to
his
visitor
for
having
so
summarily
despatched
his
formidable
spouse
then
he
said
umo
i
have
sent
for
you
because
a
speech
has
been
spoken
here
in
this
house
which
belongs
to
my
mother
that
speech
may
be
good
and
it
may
not
be
good
and
i
cared
not
to
tell
my
thoughts
until
i
had
spoken
to
you
nashtio
the
matters
of
which
it
treated
belong
before
the
council
but
i
do
not
know
whether
to
say
to
you
the
nashtio
of
the
zaashtesh
call
them
together
or
not
he
was
manifestly
troubled
and
fastened
an
uncertain
glance
upon
the
face
of
the
other
topanashka
very
composedly
answered
you
are
as
wise
as
i
umo
you
know
what
your
duties
are
whenever
you
say
to
me
go
and
call
together
the
council
i
shall
do
it
if
you
do
not
tell
me
to
do
so
i
shall
not
hoshkanyi
moved
in
his
seat
the
reply
did
not
suit
him
after
some
hesitation
he
continued
i
know
father
that
you
do
as
the
customs
of
the
zaashtesh
require
he
held
himself
erect
with
an
attempt
at
pride
for
he
felt
that
in
the
present
instance
his
personality
and
word
represented
customs
which
were
law
but
i
do
not
know
that
i
shall
tell
you
so
or
not
do
you
understand
me
umo
i
understand
your
words
tapop
but
you
know
that
i
have
only
to
act
whereas
it
is
your
office
to
speak
the
cool
reply
exasperated
the
little
man
he
retorted
sharply
and
yet
you
have
often
spoken
in
the
council
when
your
hanutsh
wanted
something
topanashka
lifted
his
eyes
and
gazed
fully
calmly
at
the
other
he
even
suppressed
a
smile
then
it
is
your
hanutsh
shyuamo
that
wants
something
this
time
hoshkanyi
felt
as
the
saying
is
very
cheap
his
secret
was
out
and
his
plan
to
obtain
an
expression
of
opinion
from
the
maseua
ere
he
came
to
a
conclusion
himself
a
total
failure
the
latter
added
in
a
deprecating
way
if
you
do
not
know
what
to
do
ask
the
hotshanyi
he
will
give
you
good
advice
this
was
just
what
the
governor
wished
to
avoid
but
he
knew
that
when
topanashka
had
once
expressed
his
opinion
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
dissuade
him
after
an
interval
of
silence
the
civil
chief
looked
up
and
said
come
let
us
go
to
the
hotshanyi
topanashka
thought
over
this
proposal
for
a
moment
it
is
well
he
at
last
assented
i
will
go
with
this
he
rose
the
governor
rose
also
but
was
so
embarrassed
and
excited
that
he
would
have
run
out
as
he
was
in
almost
complete
undress
had
not
the
maseua
reminded
him
by
saying
remember
that
we
are
going
to
the
shiuana
adding
take
some
meal
along
have
you
any
with
you
inquired
hoshkanyi
with
a
venomous
look
the
other
responded
quietly
i
do
not
need
any
you
are
seeking
their
advice
not
i
that
settled
the
matter
as
both
went
out
koay
who
had
been
sitting
as
close
by
the
doorway
as
possible
snappishly
asked
her
husband
where
are
you
going
hachshtze
topanashka
took
the
trouble
of
satisfying
her
curiosity
by
dryly
answering
about
our
own
business
the
icy
look
with
which
he
accompanied
his
retort
subdued
the
woman
the
hotshanyi
or
chief
penitent
lived
with
the
people
of
the
clan
his
abode
consisted
of
two
caves
on
the
lower
and
one
on
the
upper
tier
the
two
officers
of
the
tribe
wandered
slowly
along
the
cliffs
past
the
abodes
of
the
sun
clan
topanashka
walking
as
usual
erect
with
his
head
bent
slightly
forward
hoshkanyi
with
a
pompous
air
glad
to
display
himself
in
company
with
his
much
more
respected
colleague
to
whom
all
the
pleasant
greetings
which
the
two
received
on
their
peregrination
were
really
directed
when
they
reached
the
cave
wherein
the
cacique
resided
hoshkanyi
entered
first
close
to
the
fireplace
which
was
one
of
those
primitive
chimneys
like
the
one
we
have
seen
in
the
home
of
shotaye
an
old
man
was
seated
on
the
floor
his
age
was
certainly
greater
than
topanashka
he
was
of
middle
height
lean
and
even
emaciated
his
eyes
were
dim
and
he
received
the
greetings
of
his
visitors
with
an
air
of
indifference
or
timidity
it
was
difficult
to
determine
which
pointing
to
the
floor
he
said
what
brings
you
to
my
house
children
and
he
coughed
a
hollow
hectic
cough
the
tapop
began
we
wish
do
not
say
we
the
maseua
corrected
him
you
wish
not
i
hoshkanyi
bit
his
lips
and
began
anew
i
and
my
brother
here
have
come
because
i
want
to
ask
you
something
but
if
you
are
at
work
grandfather
then
we
will
go
i
am
not
working
sa
uishe
said
the
cacique
speak
i
listen
what
is
it
you
wish
can
i
see
the
kopishtai
hoshkanyi
whispered
anxiously
the
eyes
of
the
hotshanyi
brightened
his
look
suddenly
became
clear
and
firm
with
surprising
alacrity
he
rose
as
if
he
had
become
younger
at
once
his
whole
figure
although
bent
attained
vigour
and
elasticity
before
leaving
the
cave
he
looked
inquiringly
at
topanashka
who
only
shook
his
head
and
said
in
a
low
tone
i
have
nothing
to
ask
the
two
left
the
room
the
place
where
those
above
were
thought
to
be
accessible
to
the
intercession
of
man
was
the
cave
adjoining
but
there
was
no
communication
between
the
two
chambers
presently
the
cacique
crept
back
to
where
they
had
left
topanashka
alone
and
hoshkanyi
followed
the
former
resumed
his
seat
by
the
hearth
whereas
the
tapop
cowered
in
front
of
him
he
looked
anxiously
in
the
old
man
face
and
at
the
same
time
shot
an
occasional
quick
glance
over
toward
the
maseua
in
a
hollow
voice
the
hotshanyi
said
you
may
speak
now
sa
uishe
the
kopishtai
know
that
you
are
here
sa
umo
hotshanyi
the
tapop
commenced
i
have
listened
to
a
speech
things
have
been
said
to
me
that
concern
the
tribe
he
stopped
short
and
fastened
his
eyes
on
the
floor
this
is
well
the
cacique
said
encouragingly
you
must
hear
what
the
children
of
p
yatyama
and
sanatyaya
are
doing
you
are
their
father
hoshkanyi
sighed
and
appeared
to
be
much
embarrassed
speak
mot
tza
urged
the
old
man
i
do
know
what
to
do
the
little
man
stuttered
have
you
been
asked
to
do
anything
yes
they
have
he
stopped
sighed
again
and
then
proceeded
hastily
and
with
an
expression
of
anguish
in
his
face
shyuamo
hanutsh
asks
that
tzitz
hanutsh
the
hotshanyi
commanded
him
to
desist
stay
stay
hoshkanyi
tihua
he
hoarsely
exclaimed
you
know
that
we
the
mothers
of
the
tribe
will
not
listen
to
anything
that
divides
our
children
among
themselves
or
that
might
cause
division
among
them
you
ask
for
advice
from
me
this
advice
you
shall
receive
but
only
on
things
that
i
can
know
of
and
which
i
dare
to
hear
if
you
speak
to
me
of
strife
and
dispute
i
shall
not
listen
to
it
speak
of
yourself
not
of
others
topanashka
was
an
attentive
listener
but
not
a
muscle
in
his
face
moved
whereas
the
little
tapop
was
manifestly
in
great
trouble
he
coughed
hemmed
and
hawed
twisted
his
body
moved
uneasily
in
his
seat
and
at
last
continued
in
a
faltering
manner
i
do
not
know
whether
or
not
i
ought
to
call
the
council
together
were
you
asked
to
do
it
yes
then
you
must
do
it
it
is
your
duty
replied
the
hotshanyi
he
spoke
imperatively
and
with
remarkable
dignity
of
manner
thus
the
first
point
was
settled
and
the
tapop
with
growing
uneasiness
proceeded
to
his
next
it
has
been
said
to
me
that
i
should
send
my
brother
here
pointing
at
topanashka
to
call
together
the
fathers
now
is
it
well
to
do
so
or
shall
i
send
the
assistant
civil
chieftain
to
the
men
hoshkanyi
spoke
like
a
schoolboy
who
was
delivering
a
disagreeable
message
the
matter
in
itself
seemed
of
no
consequence
at
all
but
the
manner
in
which
the
governor
spoke
and
acted
looked
extremely
suspicious
both
of
his
listeners
became
attentive
the
cacique
displayed
no
signs
of
surprise
but
he
looked
at
the
speaker
fixedly
and
inquired
of
him
speaking
very
slowly
is
my
brother
the
maseua
willing
to
go
i
have
not
asked
him
as
yet
then
ask
him
sternly
commanded
the
old
man
almost
trembling
the
tapop
turned
to
topanashka
who
was
sitting
immovable
with
lips
firmly
set
and
sparkling
eyes
will
you
call
the
council
together
nashtio
no
exclaimed
the
maseua
you
have
heard
what
your
brother
says
coldly
proceeded
the
cacique
you
know
now
what
you
are
to
do
my
brother
will
not
go
and
you
can
only
command
him
if
the
council
orders
you
to
do
so
therefore
send
the
assistant
he
is
your
messenger
do
your
duty
and
nothing
else
for
it
is
not
good
to
attempt
anything
new
unless
p
yatyama
has
so
directed
the
words
were
spoken
in
a
tone
of
solemn
warning
and
even
topanashka
was
startled
for
never
before
had
he
heard
the
hotshanyi
speak
thus
the
old
man
had
always
been
very
meek
and
mild
in
his
utterances
but
now
his
voice
sounded
almost
prophetic
was
he
inspired
by
those
above
did
the
shiuana
speak
through
him
was
there
danger
for
the
tribe
at
all
events
the
conference
had
come
to
a
close
for
the
cacique
had
bent
his
head
and
spoke
no
more
trouashatze
sa
umo
said
topanashka
and
left
the
room
hoshkanyi
followed
hurriedly
the
cacique
took
no
notice
of
their
departure
when
both
men
stood
outside
topanashka
turned
to
the
tapop
coldly
asking
are
you
going
to
call
the
council
i
will
whined
the
little
man
for
what
day
i
do
know
yet
but
i
want
to
know
sternly
almost
menacingly
insisted
the
other
i
want
to
know
for
i
shall
be
present
four
days
from
now
cried
hoshkanyi
trembling
what
time
i
do
know
yet
when
the
moon
rises
he
added
in
despair
as
the
cold
determined
gaze
of
topanashka
met
his
eye
without
a
further
word
the
turned
and
went
off
hoshkanyi
was
utterly
annihilated
he
had
made
a
total
failure
and
as
he
stood
there
like
a
child
that
has
just
been
thoroughly
whipped
he
began
to
curse
the
weakness
that
had
caused
him
to
yield
to
the
advice
and
the
demands
of
tyope
for
it
was
tyope
who
had
brought
him
to
act
the
part
in
which
the
unfortunate
governor
had
so
disgracefully
failed
tyope
when
as
representative
of
the
clan
shyuamo
he
asked
the
tapop
to
call
together
the
council
for
a
matter
wherein
the
turquoise
people
were
interested
had
artfully
told
him
that
as
one
of
their
number
it
would
be
better
if
the
maseua
would
issue
the
call
he
knew
very
well
that
this
was
an
innovation
but
the
deceiver
made
it
apparent
that
if
topanashka
should
yield
and
commit
the
desired
misstep
the
blame
would
of
course
fall
upon
the
and
the
civil
chief
would
profit
by
the
other
mistake
and
would
gain
in
the
opinion
of
the
people
at
the
expense
of
the
maseua
but
tyope
cunning
as
he
was
had
underrated
the
firmness
and
perspicacity
of
topanashka
as
much
as
he
had
overrated
the
abilities
of
hoshkanyi
as
soon
as
the
latter
saw
the
rigidity
of
his
colleague
in
a
matter
of
duty
he
felt
completely
at
sea
he
lost
sight
of
everything
that
tyope
had
recommended
tumbled
from
one
mistake
to
another
and
finally
exposed
himself
to
grave
suspicions
as
the
popular
saying
is
he
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
and
made
an
absolute
miserable
fiasco
all
this
he
saw
clearly
and
he
cursed
tyope
and
cursed
himself
for
having
become
his
tool
more
than
that
he
trembled
when
he
thought
of
what
tyope
would
say
and
also
what
his
own
energetic
wife
would
call
him
and
even
perhaps
do
to
him
if
he
went
home
for
koay
was
sure
to
exact
a
full
report
of
what
had
occurred
and
to
save
himself
nothing
remained
but
to
tell
her
lies
this
he
finally
determined
upon
but
to
tyope
he
could
not
lie
to
tyope
he
must
tell
the
truth
and
then
hoshkanyi
tihua
wended
his
way
home
wrapped
in
thoughts
of
a
very
unsatisfactory
nature
while
the
governor
of
the
queres
was
thus
agitated
by
unpleasant
forebodings
the
mind
of
the
was
not
less
occupied
by
gloomy
thoughts
of
all
the
leading
men
of
the
tribe
topanashka
saw
perhaps
most
clearly
the
sinister
machinations
of
some
of
the
turquoise
people
still
he
had
not
discovered
and
could
not
even
surmise
the
real
object
of
their
intrigues
of
an
intention
to
divide
the
tribe
he
had
no
idea
personal
ambition
greed
and
thirst
for
influence
was
all
he
could
think
of
and
he
felt
sure
that
they
would
not
prevail
for
to
personal
ambition
the
tribal
system
afforded
little
if
any
opportunity
it
was
manifest
however
from
what
hoshkanyi
had
involuntarily
divulged
that
the
clan
shyuamo
intended
to
press
some
claim
against
the
small
water
clan
which
besides
was
so
distantly
located
from
the
abodes
and
the
lands
of
the
turquoise
that
he
could
see
no
just
reason
for
a
claim
it
was
equally
impossible
for
him
to
imagine
the
nature
of
the
claim
quarrels
between
clans
are
always
most
dangerous
for
the
existence
of
a
tribe
for
disruption
and
consequent
weakening
is
likely
to
result
from
them
the
old
man
felt
the
gravest
apprehensions
he
saw
imminent
danger
for
his
people
and
still
he
could
not
arrive
at
any
conclusion
before
the
threatening
storm
had
broken
there
was
no
possibility
of
averting
the
peril
for
he
could
not
even
mention
its
approach
to
any
one
topanashka
was
calm
and
absolutely
brave
his
life
was
nothing
to
him
except
as
indispensable
for
the
performance
of
his
duty
he
knew
long
ago
that
the
leaders
of
the
movement
for
which
the
turquoise
people
were
used
as
hated
him
that
he
was
a
thorn
in
their
flesh
a
stone
in
their
crooked
paths
if
the
revelations
of
hoshkanyi
created
deep
apprehensions
in
him
it
was
out
of
no
personal
fear
in
the
present
instance
it
was
clear
that
a
trap
had
been
set
for
the
purpose
of
decoying
him
into
a
false
move
it
was
the
first
time
that
anything
of
the
kind
had
been
attempted
and
topanashka
looked
upon
it
as
very
serious
not
for
his
individual
sake
but
because
it
showed
that
it
was
undertaken
jointly
with
a
move
that
was
sure
to
bring
about
internal
disturbances
and
was
probably
a
part
of
that
move
itself
and
because
it
exhibited
a
degree
of
boldness
on
the
part
of
the
schemers
which
proved
that
their
plans
were
nearly
if
not
absolutely
mature
a
crisis
was
near
at
hand
he
saw
it
but
it
could
not
be
prevented
a
deep
gloom
settled
on
the
heart
of
the
old
maseua
and
something
like
despondency
crept
over
him
at
times
it
caused
him
to
forget
the
matter
of
his
grandson
wooing
and
his
proposed
appeal
to
the
shiuana
in
behalf
of
okoya
and
to
look
forward
to
the
momentous
time
four
days
hence
when
his
mind
would
become
enlightened
on
the
impending
danger
all
his
thoughts
were
henceforth
with
the
council
and
the
object
for
which
it
was
to
be
held
he
looked
forward
to
it
with
sadness
and
even
with
fear
it
was
clear
to
him
that
the
hour
of
that
council
must
become
an
evil
hour
in
the
annals
of
his
people
chapter
xi
the
four
days
at
the
expiration
of
which
the
council
was
to
take
place
were
drawing
to
a
close
for
it
was
the
night
of
the
fourth
that
on
which
the
uuityam
was
to
meet
it
was
a
beautiful
night
the
full
moon
shone
down
into
the
gorge
in
its
greatest
splendour
and
only
along
the
cliffs
was
it
possible
to
walk
in
the
shadow
the
air
was
cool
and
balmy
not
a
breeze
stirred
and
the
population
of
the
rito
seemed
to
enjoy
the
luminous
still
and
refreshing
hours
that
followed
upon
a
warm
and
busy
day
laughter
singing
shouting
came
from
the
roofs
and
the
vicinity
of
the
houses
as
well
as
from
the
caves
and
their
approaches
the
people
felt
happy
few
if
any
suspected
that
a
momentous
question
agitated
the
minds
of
some
of
their
number
two
men
were
walking
along
the
cliffs
toward
the
group
of
which
the
clan
inhabited
they
hugged
the
rocks
so
closely
that
most
of
the
time
their
figures
disappeared
in
the
inky
shadows
of
projecting
or
beetling
cliffs
and
pillars
one
of
these
men
asked
in
a
low
tone
are
you
going
to
the
uuityam
i
am
replied
the
other
the
words
were
spoken
in
a
tone
sufficiently
loud
to
enable
any
one
acquainted
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
tyuonyi
to
recognize
in
the
first
speaker
tyame
tihua
the
delegate
or
councilman
from
the
eagle
clan
in
the
other
our
old
friend
topanashka
after
exchanging
these
few
words
both
continued
their
walk
in
silence
the
round
chamber
in
which
the
meetings
of
the
tribal
council
were
usually
held
exists
as
a
semicircular
indentation
in
the
cliffs
the
rudely
arched
ceiling
of
which
is
still
covered
with
a
thick
coating
of
soot
the
front
wall
has
crumbled
long
ago
at
the
time
we
speak
of
it
was
entire
and
the
apartment
formed
a
nearly
circular
hall
of
more
than
usual
size
with
a
low
entrance
in
front
and
two
small
on
each
side
of
the
doorway
as
the
two
men
approached
the
place
they
noticed
that
a
number
of
others
were
already
congregated
in
front
of
it
but
that
no
light
issued
from
the
interior
it
was
a
sign
that
the
council
was
not
yet
assembled
and
especially
that
the
religious
chiefs
had
not
made
their
appearance
those
who
were
present
assumed
any
posture
imaginable
provided
it
gave
them
comfort
they
talked
and
conversed
about
very
unimportant
matters
and
laughed
and
joked
there
was
no
division
into
separate
groups
foreshadowing
the
drift
of
opinions
and
of
interests
for
no
lobbying
was
going
on
every
one
seemed
to
be
as
free
and
easy
as
in
his
own
home
or
in
the
estufa
among
his
companions
and
the
greatest
apparent
harmony
prevailed
one
man
only
had
retired
to
a
rocky
recess
where
he
sat
aloof
from
the
others
in
the
darkest
shadow
of
the
already
shadowy
spot
it
was
the
old
chief
of
the
delight
makers
the
koshare
naua
when
the
last
two
comers
reached
the
group
and
offered
the
usual
greeting
the
conversation
in
which
the
delegate
from
tzitz
hanutsh
a
short
stout
man
and
his
colleague
from
oshatsh
had
been
the
loudest
participants
came
to
a
sudden
stop
the
subject
of
the
discussion
was
not
a
reason
for
its
abrupt
breaking
off
for
it
was
merely
the
topic
as
to
whether
two
summers
ago
it
had
rained
as
early
as
this
year
it
was
out
of
respect
for
the
maseua
out
of
deference
to
his
presence
that
the
other
clan
representatives
became
silent
all
except
one
that
one
was
tyope
who
continued
the
subject
as
if
he
intended
to
display
greater
independence
than
the
rest
nevertheless
as
no
one
paid
attention
to
his
speech
he
felt
at
last
constrained
to
drop
into
silence
not
for
a
long
time
however
for
as
if
he
wished
to
atone
for
his
lack
of
civility
he
called
out
to
topanashka
you
are
late
sa
nashtio
early
enough
yet
satyumishe
replied
the
old
man
quietly
and
tyame
remarked
shyuamo
dwells
nearer
to
the
uuityam
than
we
the
turquoise
men
have
everything
close
at
hand
the
tapop
the
place
everything
and
everybody
all
we
have
is
the
maseua
he
added
laughing
and
he
is
very
old
the
laughter
became
general
and
tyope
said
in
a
tone
of
flattery
our
nashtio
is
old
but
he
is
still
stronger
than
you
tyame
he
is
also
wiser
than
all
of
us
together
our
father
is
very
strong
runs
like
a
deer
and
his
eye
is
that
of
an
eagle
there
was
something
like
irony
in
this
speech
but
topanashka
took
no
notice
of
it
he
was
looking
for
the
tapop
a
difficult
task
in
the
darkness
where
a
number
of
men
are
grouped
in
all
kinds
of
postures
finally
he
inquired
where
is
hoshkanyi
not
here
came
a
reply
from
several
voices
and
the
yaya
tza
yaya
was
the
negative
answer
then
we
are
not
too
late
said
the
turning
to
tyame
he
sat
down
among
the
rest
and
the
talk
went
on
as
before
his
arrival
at
last
the
governor
came
he
offered
a
short
greeting
and
received
a
careless
reply
then
he
crawled
into
the
cave
and
his
assistant
followed
him
soon
a
rustling
noise
was
heard
inside
a
grating
like
that
of
a
drill
followed
and
everybody
outside
became
silent
the
tapop
was
starting
the
and
he
used
for
the
purpose
that
venerable
implement
of
primitive
times
the
it
was
a
sacred
performance
therefore
the
sudden
silence
of
all
within
hearing
of
the
process
little
by
little
a
glimmer
of
light
illuminated
the
entrance
of
the
cave
the
fire
had
started
which
was
a
favourable
omen
now
the
conversation
might
be
resumed
but
nobody
entered
the
room
the
fire
was
burning
and
its
light
shone
vividly
through
doorway
and
and
the
men
outside
were
beginning
to
move
and
to
yawn
and
some
had
even
fallen
asleep
but
no
one
gave
a
sign
of
impatience
stillness
prevailed
it
was
so
late
that
all
noise
and
bustle
had
ceased
and
the
rippling
and
rushing
of
the
brook
alone
pervaded
the
night
several
more
men
approached
from
various
directions
their
steps
were
almost
inaudible
and
when
they
reached
the
company
each
invariably
uttered
a
hoarse
guatzena
sa
uishe
one
by
one
the
glided
into
the
estufa
until
six
of
them
had
entered
then
a
metallic
sound
was
heard
within
as
if
two
plates
of
very
hard
material
were
beaten
against
each
other
all
rose
at
once
those
who
had
fallen
asleep
were
shaken
and
pulled
until
they
woke
and
one
after
another
filed
into
the
chamber
topanashka
being
the
last
the
metallic
sound
produced
by
two
plates
of
basalt
had
been
the
call
to
council
the
interior
of
the
estufa
was
as
brightly
illuminated
as
a
small
fire
could
make
it
the
smoke
of
which
found
egress
through
the
door
and
the
two
or
rose
to
the
low
ceiling
where
it
floated
like
a
grayish
cloud
the
air
was
heavy
and
stifling
and
the
odour
of
burning
pitch
proceeded
from
the
pine
wood
with
which
the
flames
were
fed
in
the
centre
of
the
room
close
to
the
fire
the
tapop
had
squatted
with
three
aged
men
by
his
side
in
the
same
posture
all
three
wore
short
black
wraps
with
red
stripes
we
recognize
in
one
of
these
men
who
sit
with
humble
downcast
looks
the
chief
penitent
or
hotshanyi
the
other
two
are
his
assistants
the
shaykatze
and
the
uishtyaka
in
their
immediate
neighbourhood
sat
three
others
whose
hair
also
was
turning
gray
but
they
sat
upright
and
looked
around
with
freedom
and
assurance
their
dress
had
nothing
particular
or
distinctive
about
it
but
each
carried
on
his
head
feathers
of
a
certain
kind
one
with
a
tall
spare
figure
an
intelligent
face
and
dark
complexion
wore
behind
each
ear
one
blue
and
one
yellow
feather
he
was
the
hishtanyi
chayan
the
principal
of
the
tribe
next
to
him
was
the
shkuy
chayan
or
great
shaman
for
the
hunt
equally
tall
slender
and
with
a
thin
face
and
quick
unsteady
glance
the
third
or
shikama
chayan
was
an
individual
of
ordinary
looks
and
coarse
features
who
was
decorated
by
a
single
upright
feather
the
leaders
of
the
societies
of
the
koshare
and
cuirana
had
squatted
among
the
central
group
while
a
projection
that
ran
around
the
whole
room
served
as
a
bench
or
settee
for
the
representatives
of
the
clans
this
arrangement
corresponded
closely
to
the
degree
of
importance
of
the
various
officers
or
rather
to
their
assumed
proximity
to
the
higher
powers
under
whose
protection
the
tribe
believed
itself
to
be
placed
the
tapop
as
chairman
of
the
meeting
occupied
the
middle
together
with
the
principal
religious
functionaries
the
yaya
or
mothers
of
the
tribe
on
the
outer
circumference
were
placed
the
nashtio
or
fathers
the
delegates
of
the
clans
the
koshare
naua
and
his
colleague
of
the
cuirana
held
an
intermediate
position
topanashka
as
military
head
and
the
assistant
governor
who
had
neither
voice
nor
vote
sat
beside
the
entrance
guarding
it
a
lieutenant
of
the
maseua
crouched
outside
to
prevent
the
approach
of
eavesdroppers
as
soon
as
the
rustling
noise
occasioned
by
so
many
people
taking
their
seats
in
a
small
room
had
subsided
the
hishtanyi
chayan
again
seized
the
two
basalt
plates
and
caused
them
to
ring
when
the
metallic
sound
was
heard
everybody
became
very
quiet
and
not
one
of
the
men
that
composed
the
meeting
moved
all
maintained
the
deepest
silence
fastening
their
eyes
on
the
ground
the
shaman
scattered
sacred
meal
to
the
six
regions
then
he
raised
his
eyes
to
the
ceiling
and
finally
turned
to
the
three
caciques
with
the
formal
greeting
guatzena
yaya
then
to
the
others
with
guatzena
nashtio
raising
both
hands
upward
he
pronounced

again
the
speaker
scattered
yellow
meal
in
front
of
the
principal
penitent
who
only
bowed
in
a
dignified
manner
in
response
the
remainder
of
the
assembly
uttered
an
affirmative
and
one
after
the
other
rose
and
deposited
sacrificial
meal
before
the
cacique
when
each
of
them
had
resumed
his
seat
the
hishtanyi
chayan
turned
to
the
tapop
and
looked
inquiringly
hoshkanyi
tihua
assumed
an
air
of
solemn
importance
for
he
was
to
play
a
prominent
rôle
he
glanced
around
the
circle
pompously
but
when
his
eye
caught
the
cold
gaze
of
topanashka
he
felt
almost
a
chill
and
shrank
to
natural
and
more
modest
proportions
he
looked
quickly
in
the
direction
where
tyope
was
sitting
but
the
delegate
from
shyuamo
hanutsh
held
his
face
covered
with
both
hands
and
did
not
notice
the
pleading
look
of
the
little
governor
so
the
latter
began
in
an
unsteady
tone
hotshanyi
shaykatze
uishtyaka
and
you
the
mothers
of
the
tribe
hear
me
hear
me
also
you
who
are
our
fathers
his
voice
grew
stronger
he
was
recovering
assurance
i
have
called
you
together
to
listen
to
what
i
say
he
crowed
the
last
words
rather
than
spoke
them
my
brother
the
nashtio
of
shyuamo
hanutsh
continued
he
has
spoken
to
me
and
said
he
stopped
and
shot
a
glance
of
inquiry
over
toward
tyope
but
tyope
failed
to
note
it
satyumishe
has
said
my
hanutsh
is
numerous
and
has
many
children
but
only
very
little
maize
the
mot
tza
and
the
makatza
are
many
but
of
beans
there
are
few
and
the
field
we
are
tilling
is
small
hoshkanyi
tihua
was
manifestly
pleased
with
his
own
eloquence
for
he
again
looked
around
the
room
for
marks
of
admiration
only
the
icy
look
of
topanashka
met
his
gaze
and
he
proceeded
more
modestly
my
brother
from
shyuamo
then
said
to
me
here
nashtio
tapop
there
are
the
people
from
tzitz
they
are
the
least
in
numbers
on
the
tyuonyi
and
yet
they
have
as
much
ground
as
we
and
they
raised
as
much
maize
and
even
more
beans
for
they
are
higher
up
than
we
and
get
more
water
than
we
now
therefore
call
them
together
all
the
yaya
and
the
fathers
and
say
to
them
shyuamo
hanutsh
demands
from
tzitz
hanutsh
that
it
should
share
its
field
with
us
for
where
there
are
two
mouths
of
shyuamo
there
is
only
one
of
tzitz
but
when
tzitz
raises
one
ear
of
corn
shyuamo
grows
not
more
than
one
he
had
spoken
and
drew
a
heavy
sigh
of
relief
the
most
profound
silence
reigned
tyope
remained
with
his
head
bowed
and
his
face
covered
with
both
hands
topanashka
sat
rigidly
immovable
his
cold
piercing
gaze
fastened
on
the
tapop
the
representative
of
the
water
clan
made
a
very
wry
face
and
looked
at
the
fire
the
tapop
had
yet
to
perform
one
duty
ere
discussion
could
begin
he
turned
to
the
hotshanyi
and
addressed
him
sa
umo
you
and
your
brethren
the
shaykatze
and
the
uishtyaka
i
address
what
do
you
say
to
what
shyuamo
is
asking
speak
yaya
we
are
your
children
we
listen
you
are
old
and
wise
we
are
young
and
weak
the
old
cacique
raised
his
dim
eyes
to
the
speaker
and
replied
in
a
hoarse
voice
i
thank
you
sa
uishe
i
thank
you
for
myself
and
for
my
brethren
here
that
you
have
put
this
question
to
us
but
the
voice
grew
more
steady
and
strong
you
know
that
it
is
our
duty
to
pray
to
fast
and
to
watch
that
peace
may
rule
among
the
zaashtesh
and
that
nothing
may
disturb
it
we
can
not
listen
to
anything
that
calls
forth
two
kinds
of
words
and
that
may
bring
strife
he
emphasized
strongly
the
latter
word
we
can
not
therefore
remain
may
the
shiuana
enlighten
your
hearts
we
shall
pray
that
they
will
counsel
you
to
do
good
only
the
old
hotshanyi
rose
and
went
toward
the
doorway
his
form
was
bent
his
step
faltering
his
two
associates
followed
not
one
of
those
present
dared
to
look
at
them
none
of
them
noticed
the
deeply
mournfully
significant
glance
which
the
cacique
while
he
crept
through
the
door
exchanged
with
topanashka
the
address
which
the
governor
had
directed
to
the
official
penitents
was
a
mere
formality
but
a
formality
that
could
not
be
dispensed
with
it
was
an
act
of
courtesy
toward
those
who
in
the
tribe
as
well
as
in
the
council
represented
the
higher
powers
but
as
these
powers
are
conceived
as
being
good
it
is
not
allowed
to
speak
in
their
presence
of
anything
that
might
in
the
remotest
manner
even
bear
evil
consequences
such
as
disunion
and
strife
therefore
the
caciques
as
soon
as
they
had
been
informed
of
the
subject
could
not
stay
at
the
meeting
but
had
to
retire
this
happens
at
every
discussion
of
a
similar
nature
and
their
departure
was
merely
in
the
ordinary
routine
of
business
nobody
felt
shocked
or
even
surprised
at
it
but
everybody
on
the
other
hand
noticed
the
reply
given
by
the
aged
hotshanyi
felt
it
like
some
dread
warning
the
foreboding
of
some
momentous
question
of
danger
to
the
people
an
uneasy
feeling
crept
over
many
of
the
assistants
who
were
not
like
tyope
and
the
koshare
naua
in
the
secrets
of
the
case
after
the
departure
of
the
caciques
therefore
the
same
dead
silence
prevailed
as
before
the
tapop
broke
the
silence
by
turning
officially
to
the
principal
shaman
and
asking
him
sa
umo
yaya
what
do
you
hold
concerning
the
demand
of
our
children
from
shyuamo
the
chayan
raised
his
face
his
eyes
sparkled
he
gave
his
reply
in
a
positive
tone
i
hold
it
is
well
provided
tzitz
hanutsh
is
satisfied
he
bent
his
head
again
in
token
that
he
had
said
as
much
as
he
cared
to
say
for
the
present
hoshkanyi
tihua
then
interrogated
the
shkuy
chayan
who
very
pointedly
answered
it
is
good
his
colleague
the
shikama
chayan
remained
saying
it
may
be
good
it
may
not
be
good
i
do
not
know
my
hanutsh
is
shutzuna
he
cast
a
rapid
glance
to
where
the
delegate
of
the
people
was
sitting
and
we
have
enough
land
for
ourselves
the
governor
now
addressed
the
same
question
successively
to
the
koshare
naua
and
to
the
leader
of
the
cuirana
the
dim
eyes
of
the
former
began
to
gleam
his
shrivelled
features
assumed
a
hideous
wolfish
expression
as
he
spoke
in
a
voice
trembling
yet
clear
it
is
well
our
brethren
deserve
what
they
demand
if
the
crops
ripen
my
children
from
shyuamo
are
those
who
pray
and
fast
most
of
all
my
hanutsh
alone
counts
more
koshare
than
all
the
others
together
if
they
get
more
land
they
will
fast
and
pray
so
much
the
more
and
this
they
do
not
for
themselves
only
but
for
the
benefit
of
all
who
dwell
on
the
tyuonyi
the
cuirana
naua
on
the
other
hand
gave
a
confused
and
unsatisfactory
reply
in
his
opinion
it
would
be
well
if
both
clans
could
agree
it
was
next
the
turn
of
the
clan
delegates
to
be
called
up
they
were
those
most
directly
interested
but
until
now
they
had
out
of
deference
for
their
religious
leaders
maintained
an
absolutely
passive
attitude
after
the
cuirana
naua
had
spoken
however
many
raised
their
faces
changed
their
positions
some
looked
at
the
tapop
with
an
air
of
expectancy
others
glanced
around
still
others
seemed
to
denote
by
their
demeanour
that
they
were
anxious
and
eager
to
speak
tyope
and
topanashka
alone
did
not
change
their
attitudes
the
former
remained
with
his
head
bent
and
his
face
covered
with
both
hands
the
latter
who
happened
almost
directly
to
face
tyope
with
head
erect
and
an
expression
of
calm
watchfulness
on
his
features
it
was
of
course
impossible
to
foretell
the
general
feeling
among
the
members
of
the
council
in
regard
to
the
demands
of
the
turquoise
people
the
shkuy
chayan
and
the
koshare
naua
had
declared
themselves
favourable
to
their
pretensions
but
on
the
other
hand
the
hishtanyi
chayan
and
his
word
had
greater
weight
than
their
speeches
had
made
a
very
significant
suggestion
by
reminding
the
governor
in
his
reply
that
the
matter
did
not
properly
come
before
the
tribal
council
but
should
be
settled
between
the
two
clans
directly
interested
hoshkanyi
tihua
should
have
taken
the
hint
but
hoshkanyi
tihua
had
not
the
slightest
tact
and
besides
as
a
member
of
the
clan
shyuamo
he
felt
too
much
interested
in
the
matter
not
to
be
eager
to
press
it
at
once
however
imprudent
and
out
of
place
such
action
might
be
he
was
moreover
utterly
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
he
was
nothing
but
a
tool
which
both
tyope
and
the
naua
wielded
to
further
their
perfidious
designs
the
tapop
therefore
called
upon
the
delegate
of
the
sun
clan
to
speak
he
dwelt
not
far
from
the
turquoise
people
and
he
expressed
himself
strongly
in
their
favour
it
is
true
said
he
and
i
know
it
to
be
so
that
my
friends
of
shyuamo
are
hungry
i
know
it
and
it
is
true
also
that
the
water
people
have
too
much
ground
it
is
right
therefore
for
shyuamo
to
ask
for
a
share
of
what
they
have
in
excess
how
much
it
shall
be
they
must
settle
among
themselves
everybody
did
not
appear
to
be
satisfied
with
this
but
when
the
tapop
summoned
the
representative
of
the
bear
clan
to
give
his
opinion
the
speech
of
the
latter
was
not
only
stronger
it
was
even
offensive
to
the
water
people
he
accused
them
of
having
done
wrong
in
not
sharing
their
fields
with
the
clan
of
the
turquoise
some
time
before
since
it
was
the
duty
of
those
who
had
too
much
to
divide
with
those
who
were
poorer
he
said
that
it
was
wrong
on
the
part
of
tzitz
to
have
remained
silent
when
they
knew
how
much
shyuamo
did
for
the
tribe
while
at
the
same
time
they
had
not
enough
for
their
own
existence
he
charged
the
tapop
in
the
name
of
the
council
with
delinquency
in
not
having
required
the
water
people
to
share
their
superabundance
with
those
of
the
turquoise
the
delegate
of
kohaio
was
not
only
aggressive
in
his
speech
but
his
manner
of
delivering
it
was
brusque
and
violent
and
created
quite
a
stir
and
many
of
the
members
cast
glances
at
him
which
were
not
of
a
friendly
nature
it
was
now
the
turn
of
the
delegate
of
the
water
people
and
much
depended
upon
what
he
would
say
for
he
was
besides
the
members
from
shyuamo
the
party
most
interested
in
the
proceedings
kauaitshe
as
he
was
called
was
not
unfortunately
the
man
for
the
situation
short
and
clumsy
in
figure
extremely
and
correspondingly
slow
in
thought
and
action
he
was
intellectually
heavy
and
dull
when
the
demand
upon
his
clan
was
first
formulated
he
listened
to
it
like
one
whom
it
does
not
concern
and
only
gradually
came
to
the
conception
that
the
matter
was
after
all
of
prime
importance
to
him
and
to
those
whose
interests
he
had
been
selected
to
defend
kauaitshe
was
thunderstruck
upon
arriving
at
full
comprehension
he
was
bewildered
and
would
much
rather
have
run
away
from
the
council
but
that
was
impossible
he
heard
the
men
speak
one
by
one
and
what
to
him
caused
most
anxiety
he
saw
the
moment
approaching
when
he
also
would
be
called
upon
and
the
prospect
filled
him
with
dismay
what
should
he
say
what
could
he
say
the
injustice
intended
toward
his
constituents
the
necessity
of
undertaking
a
task
for
which
he
felt
himself
incapable
terrified
him
at
first
and
soon
drove
him
to
utter
despair
and
as
all
weak
and
lazy
natures
when
they
see
themselves
driven
to
the
wall
become
frenzied
kauaitshe
when
the
tapop
turned
to
him
exploded
like
a
loaded
weapon
venting
his
wrath
upon
the
governor
instead
of
calmly
discussing
the
matter
itself
he
saw
in
the
governor
not
only
a
member
of
the
clan
whose
plans
were
detrimental
to
the
interests
of
his
kinsmen
but
chiefly
the
instrument
by
means
of
which
he
was
placed
in
the
present
difficult
position
his
face
turned
dark
then
yellow
his
eyes
glowed
like
embers
bounding
from
his
seat
he
advanced
toward
the
chairman
and
hissed
i
have
heard
yes
his
voice
became
louder
i
have
heard
enough
enough
he
screamed
you
want
to
take
from
us
what
is
ours
you
want
to
rob
us
to
steal
from
my
people
in
order
that
your
people
may
prosper
and
we
may
suffer
that
is
what
you
want
and
he
shook
his
clenched
fist
in
the
face
of
the
tapop
the
latter
started
up
like
an
irate
turkey
and
screamed
you
lie
what
we
want
from
you
is
right
you
are
only
a
few
people
and
you
are
lazy
whereas
we
are
many
and
thrifty
you
are
a
liar
hush
hush
sounded
the
voice
of
the
principal
shaman
between
the
shouts
and
screams
of
the
disputing
parties
no
no
shrieked
kauaitshe
i
will
not
hush
i
will
speak
i
will
tell
these
friends
yelled
the
tapop
in
response
and
both
the
koshare
naua
and
tyope
cried
at
once
we
are
shyuamo
not
shuatyam
their
voices
sounded
like
the
threatening
snarls
of
wild
beasts
hush
hush
the
hishtanyi
chayan
now
sternly
commanded
rising
he
grasped
the
little
governor
by
the
shoulder
pulled
him
back
to
his
place
on
the
floor
and
warningly
raised
his
hand
toward
kauaitshe
whose
mouth
one
of
his
colleagues
had
already
closed
by
force
if
you
hope
for
light
from
those
above
the
warned
the
delegate
from
tzitz
you
must
not
name
in
their
presence
the
powers
of
darkness
to
the
tapop
he
said
do
your
duty
but
do
it
as
it
ought
to
be
done
kauaitshe
reeled
back
to
his
place
where
he
sat
down
in
sullen
silence
it
happened
to
him
as
it
always
does
to
any
one
who
loses
his
temper
at
the
wrong
time
and
in
the
wrong
place
after
the
flurry
is
over
they
find
that
they
have
wasted
all
their
energies
and
remain
henceforth
incapable
of
any
effort
the
delegate
of
the
water
people
was
du
for
the
remainder
of
the
evening
the
incident
had
made
an
impression
on
the
assembly
nearly
everybody
shared
more
or
less
in
the
excitement
now
that
quiet
was
restored
apparent
calmness
seemed
to
prevail
in
their
minds
again
the
men
stared
as
motionless
as
before
but
their
faces
were
dark
and
many
an
eye
displayed
a
spark
of
passionate
fire
topanashka
had
not
moved
during
the
quarrel
and
tyope
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
as
before
hoshkanyi
voice
still
trembled
as
he
called
upon
the
representative
of
tanyi
hanutsh
the
latter
replied
there
is
more
land
yet
at
the
tyuonyi
let
shyuamo
increase
their
ground
from
some
waste
tract
there
is
no
room
for
it
growled
the
koshare
naua
i
say
there
is
defiantly
retorted
the
other
the
delegate
of
the
people
was
not
only
of
the
same
opinion
as
his
predecessor
he
even
mentioned
a
tract
of
waste
land
that
lay
east
of
the
cultivated
plots
from
which
shyuamo
might
take
what
they
needed
the
speaker
of
tzina
hanutsh
however
was
of
an
adverse
opinion
he
remarked
that
it
was
always
better
for
a
smaller
clan
to
divide
their
ground
with
a
more
powerful
one
as
in
that
case
larger
crops
would
be
raised
as
matters
stood
he
added
only
a
portion
of
the
land
belonging
to
the
water
people
was
tilled
this
the
member
from
huashpa
denied
and
reminded
him
that
the
hishtanyi
chayan
had
suggested
that
the
whole
matter
should
be
settled
by
the
two
clans
privately
both
the
cuirana
naua
and
tyame
the
delegate
of
the
eagle
clan
could
not
refrain
from
expressing
their
approval
in
an
audible
manner
by
the
customary
and
the
shikama
chayan
slightly
nodded
assent
it
was
already
late
but
nobody
thought
of
the
hour
on
such
occasions
the
indian
can
sit
up
whole
nights
without
ever
thinking
of
rest
not
only
was
everybody
interested
but
the
excitement
although
barely
visible
on
the
surface
was
rapidly
growing
and
personal
and
spite
cropped
out
more
and
more
tyame
having
expressed
himself
in
favour
of
the
opinion
of
the
delegate
from
huashpa
hanutsh
the
tapop
could
not
refrain
from
going
out
of
the
ordinary
routine
in
order
to
slight
him
and
to
give
the
floor
to
the
member
from
hiits
hanyi
this
flattered
the
popular
delegate
and
he
accordingly
spoke
so
strongly
in
favour
of
the
claim
presented
by
shyuamo
that
at
the
close
of
his
speech
several
voices
at
once
grunted
assent
both
parties
were
growing
decidedly
bitter
tyame
noticed
the
intended
slight
so
when
hoshkanyi
called
him
up
he
opened
his
talk
with
the
remark
one
can
see
that
you
are
shyuamo
that
is
what
i
am
the
little
fellow
bragged
but
you
are
tapop
also
tyame
objected
why
do
you
speak
thus
are
you
angry
that
you
could
not
be
used
for
the
place
venomously
inquired
the
governor
illustration
the
hishtanyi
chayan
or
chief
medicine
man
if
i
were
in
your
place
retorted
the
eagle
i
should
do
as
is
customary
and
call
upon
each
one
in
turn
you
have
time
enough
left
to
speak
against
shyuamo
said
the
chief
of
the
delight
makers
in
a
wicked
manner
that
i
shall
do
most
assuredly
exclaimed
tyame
i
am
against
giving
shyuamo
any
more
ground
than
they
have
at
present
you
have
enough
for
yourselves
for
your
women
and
for
all
your
children
do
more
work
in
the
field
and
do
less
penance
be
shyayak
rather
than
koshare
he
rose
and
turned
toward
tyope
your
woman
belongs
to
our
hanutsh
and
i
know
that
it
is
not
you
who
feed
her
and
so
you
are
all
of
you
you
live
from
other
people
crops
tyope
looked
up
and
his
eyes
flashed
but
in
a
quiet
tone
he
answered
your
woman
is
shyuamo
you
know
best
how
it
is
the
other
continued
with
growing
passion
and
when
your
wife
was
from
tzitz
everybody
knew
that
it
was
not
you
who
supported
her
but
that
she
maintained
you
loud
murmurs
arose
and
the
shkuy
chayan
called
tyame
to
order
so
that
tyope
did
not
have
time
for
a
reply
to
this
insulting
insinuation
of
all
the
clans
represented
three
had
yet
to
express
their
views
these
were
the
clans
of
yakka
of
the
panther
and
shyuamo
the
delegate
of
the
corn
people
was
no
friend
of
tyame
therefore
he
spoke
directly
against
what
the
eagle
had
intimated
he
emphasized
how
detrimental
it
might
become
for
a
small
cluster
to
own
too
much
tillable
land
while
a
large
and
important
clan
was
suffering
for
the
lack
of
vegetable
food
with
notable
shrewdness
he
exposed
to
the
meeting
the
danger
for
the
whole
tribe
in
case
one
of
its
principal
components
should
begin
to
decrease
in
numbers
he
wound
up
by
saying
the
strong
hanutsh
are
those
who
maintain
the
tribe
for
they
are
those
who
give
us
the
most
people
that
do
penance
for
the
welfare
of
all
be
they
koshare
or
cuirana
they
also
have
the
greatest
number
of
warriors
and
hunters
if
they
have
nothing
to
eat
they
can
not
watch
pray
and
fast
in
honour
of
those
above
so
the
shiuana
and
the
kopishtai
become
dissatisfied
with
us
and
withdraw
their
protection
from
their
children
and
we
become
lost
through
suffering
those
to
starve
who
are
most
useful
but
he
omitted
altogether
the
important
fact
that
there
was
still
waste
land
in
the
gorge
and
that
it
was
far
preferable
to
redeem
such
tracts
than
to
create
dissension
still
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
the
clearing
of
timbered
expanses
such
as
those
on
the
eastern
end
of
the
valley
mostly
were
opposed
great
difficulties
to
the
indian
at
the
time
when
the
rito
was
settled
the
native
had
only
stone
implements
to
cut
down
trees
to
clear
brush
even
was
a
tedious
and
protracted
undertaking
when
it
had
to
be
performed
with
stone
axes
and
hatchets
fire
was
the
most
effective
agent
but
fire
in
such
proximity
to
the
dwellings
was
a
dangerous
servant
on
the
western
end
there
was
no
tillable
land
beyond
the
patches
of
the
water
clan
still
if
there
had
been
any
disposition
on
the
part
of
shyuamo
to
be
reasonable
they
would
have
remained
satisfied
with
extending
their
field
slowly
and
gradually
toward
the
east
but
neither
tyope
nor
the
naua
really
wanted
more
land
what
they
desired
was
strife
disunion
an
irremediable
breach
in
the
tribe
the
panther
clan
whose
representative
had
to
speak
now
was
a
cluster
which
belonged
neither
to
the
larger
nor
to
the
smaller
groups
occupying
as
was
the
case
a
section
of
the
big
house
the
panther
people
were
consequently
near
neighbours
of
tanyi
and
they
sympathized
generally
with
the
latter
their
delegate
however
was
koshare
and
he
leaned
not
so
much
toward
the
turquoise
as
toward
what
seemed
to
be
the
desire
of
the
leading
delight
makers
the
naua
and
tyope
he
therefore
expressed
himself
bluntly
in
favour
of
tzitz
hanutsh
giving
up
a
certain
quantity
of
land
to
the
clan
shyuamo
without
stating
his
opinion
or
suggesting
in
the
least
how
it
ought
to
be
done
every
member
of
the
council
tyope
and
topanashka
excepted
had
spoken
the
majority
of
votes
seemed
in
favour
of
the
claim
represented
but
it
is
not
plurality
of
votes
which
decides
but
unanimity
of
opinion
and
conviction
and
finally
and
in
the
last
instance
the
utterances
of
those
who
speak
in
the
name
of
the
powers
above
the
shamans
had
given
their
opinions
the
shkuy
was
manifestly
favourable
to
shyuamo
but
his
colleague
the
hishtanyi
chayan
had
spoken
in
a
manner
that
restricted
the
point
at
issue
to
a
discussion
among
the
clans
directly
interested
the
histanyi
chayan
was
a
personage
of
great
authority
and
many
of
those
who
were
on
the
side
of
the
turquoise
people
thought
his
word
to
be
law
in
the
end
they
had
shown
themselves
friendly
toward
their
brethren
of
shyuamo
willing
however
to
abide
by
what
the
closing
discussion
would
bring
to
light
that
discussion
was
yet
to
commence
and
the
opening
was
to
be
the
speech
of
tyope
himself
much
stress
also
was
laid
upon
what
topanashka
would
say
for
he
too
was
to
take
part
some
had
their
misgivings
concerning
the
real
object
of
the
move
which
every
one
felt
certain
tyope
and
the
koshare
naua
had
set
on
foot
and
when
the
tapop
summoned
tyope
to
speak
at
last
there
was
something
like
a
subdued
flutter
among
the
audience
many
turned
their
heads
in
the
direction
of
the
speaker
others
displayed
in
their
features
the
marks
of
unusual
attention
tyope
rose
slowly
from
his
seat
he
looked
around
quietly
there
was
a
sardonic
smile
on
his
lips
his
eyes
almost
closed
he
spoke
in
a
muffled
voice
slowly
and
very
distinctly
he
was
evidently
master
of
his
subject
and
a
natural
orator
yaya
nashtio
tapop
i
have
heard
what
you
have
all
said
and
it
is
well
for
it
is
well
for
each
one
of
you
to
have
spoken
his
thoughts
in
order
that
the
people
be
pleased
and
delight
come
into
their
hearts
for
there
are
many
of
us
the
fathers
of
the
tribe
and
each
one
has
his
own
thoughts
and
thoughts
are
like
faces
never
two
alike
for
this
reason
did
i
speak
to
our
father
the
tapop
that
he
should
call
in
the
uuityam
in
order
that
all
might
hear
and
that
nobody
could
say
afterward
hanutsh
has
taken
from
tzitz
hanutsh
what
belonged
to
the
water
people
and
behold
we
knew
nothing
about
it
shyuamo
hanutsh
he
raised
his
voice
and
glanced
around
with
flashing
eyes
has
many
people
shyuamo
is
strong
but
the
men
of
the
turquoise
are
just
they
go
about
in
daylight
and
speak
loudly
and
are
not
like
the
water
that
roars
at
night
and
drops
into
silence
as
soon
as
oshatsh
brightens
the
world
after
this
fling
at
the
delegate
of
the
water
clan
tyope
paused
a
moment
he
seemed
to
wait
for
a
reply
but
none
came
the
explanation
of
his
action
in
carrying
the
matter
before
the
council
appearing
to
satisfy
all
shyuamo
hanutsh
he
proceeded
is
great
in
numbers
but
weak
in
strength
for
its
people
have
no
food
for
themselves
and
what
they
raise
is
barely
enough
for
their
koitza
their
makatza
and
the
little
ones
they
themselves
must
starve
he
cried
in
order
that
other
clans
may
increase
through
the
children
which
my
men
beget
with
their
daughters
the
most
profound
silence
followed
these
words
the
speaker
paused
again
and
looked
around
as
if
challenging
an
answer
he
felt
very
sure
of
his
point
we
have
worked
worked
as
hard
as
any
one
on
the
tyuonyi
but
our
numbers
have
grown
faster
than
our
crops
go
and
look
at
the
field
of
shyuamo
and
you
will
see
how
many
are
the
and
how
large
the
ears
of
corn
but
the
field
is
too
small
we
have
not
more
land
than
the
turkey
people
and
not
as
much
as
the
water
clan
when
during
last
summer
no
rain
fell
notwithstanding
all
our
fasting
prayer
and
sacrifice
when
yamunyi
dried
up
and
kaname
shrivelled
tzitz
hanutsh
still
had
enough
to
eat
and
its
men
grew
fat
this
hint
at
the
stout
representative
of
the
water
clan
created
great
hilarity
her
representative
growled
you
are
not
lean
either
without
noticing
this
interruption
tyope
proceeded
its
women
and
its
children
are
well
but
we
at
the
lower
end
of
the
cliffs
he
extended
his
arm
to
the
east
starve
in
order
that
your
daughters
and
the
little
ones
whom
we
have
begotten
to
the
other
clans
shall
not
perish
we
had
no
more
than
food
enough
to
pray
for
to
fast
for
in
order
that
the
shiuana
might
not
let
our
brethren
be
lost
here
the
koshare
naua
as
well
as
the
representative
of
the
panther
clan
uttered
an
audible
and
even
the
shkuy
chayan
nodded
how
many
koshare
are
there
in
tzitz
hanutsh
how
many
in
tanyi
how
many
in
tyame
who
would
sacrifice
themselves
for
the
ripening
of
fruit
how
many
in
huashpa
shyuamo
alone
has
as
many
delight
makers
as
the
remainder
of
the
zaashtesh
one
single
clan
as
many
as
eleven
others
together
and
he
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
and
fastened
on
the
delegate
of
the
water
clan
a
glance
of
strange
fierceness
as
he
cried
while
your
koshare
feed
themselves
well
between
the
fasts
ours
starve
to
regain
strength
after
they
have
watched
prayed
and
starved
this
explosion
of
bitter
reproach
was
again
followed
by
deep
silence
tyope
was
indeed
a
fascinating
speaker
the
maseua
and
the
hishtanyi
chayan
were
the
only
ones
whom
his
oratorical
talent
could
not
lead
astray
he
proceeded
in
a
quieter
tone
we
need
more
land
some
of
our
fathers
have
suggested
that
we
should
extend
our
territory
to
the
eastward
and
open
the
soil
there
they
mean
well
but
there
is
not
enough
and
the
pines
are
too
near
shall
we
go
as
far
as
cuapa
where
there
is
enough
soil
or
where
the
kauaush
descends
to
the
painted
cave
shall
we
go
and
live
where
the
moshome
would
surround
us
and
howl
about
like
hungry
wolves
no
ere
we
do
this
we
have
thought
to
say
to
our
brethren
has
more
land
than
it
needs
tzitz
is
our
brother
and
we
will
ask
them
satyumishe
give
us
some
of
that
of
which
you
have
too
much
so
that
we
may
not
be
lost
but
not
to
the
water
people
alone
did
we
wish
to
speak
no
to
all
of
you
to
the
yaya
nashtio
and
the
tapop
that
you
all
may
know
it
and
assist
us
in
our
need
for
rather
than
starve
we
shall
leave
the
tyuonyi
and
look
for
another
place
and
then
he
concluded
you
will
become
weak
and
we
shall
be
weak
and
the
moshome
the
tehuas
and
the
puyatye
will
be
stronger
than
the
queres
for
we
shall
be
divided
he
resumed
his
seat
in
token
that
his
speech
was
ended
from
all
sides
sounded
the
affirmative
grunt
the
shkuy
chayan
and
the
cuirana
naua
even
nodded
tyope
had
spoken
very
well
hoshkanyi
tihua
was
delighted
with
the
talk
of
his
forgetful
of
his
position
as
chairman
he
looked
around
the
circle
proudly
as
if
to
say
he
can
do
it
better
than
any
one
of
you
the
stillness
that
followed
was
suddenly
broken
by
the
voice
of
the
hishtanyi
chayan
who
called
out
in
a
dry
manner
our
brother
tyope
has
spoken
well
and
all
the
others
have
spoken
as
their
hearts
directed
them
to
speak
but
my
brother
he
emphasized
the
the
maseua
has
not
yet
said
what
he
thinks
my
brother
is
very
wise
let
him
open
his
heart
to
us
there
was
a
slight
commotion
among
the
assembled
parties
the
speech
of
tyope
had
so
monopolized
their
attention
that
none
of
them
had
thought
of
the
maseua
now
they
were
reminded
of
his
presence
through
the
principal
himself
and
that
reminder
acted
like
a
reproach
the
eyes
of
all
tyope
and
the
koshare
naua
excepted
turned
toward
the
doorway
where
topanashka
was
quietly
sitting
the
two
men
from
shyuamo
affected
to
pay
no
further
attention
to
what
was
going
on
topanashka
tihua
remained
sitting
he
directed
his
sharp
keen
glance
to
the
hishtanyi
chayan
as
if
to
him
alone
he
condescended
to
speak
then
he
said
i
believe
as
you
do
nashtio
yaya
but
i
also
believe
as
you
tyope
have
spoken
so
great
was
the
surprise
caused
by
this
that
tyope
lifted
his
face
and
looked
at
the
old
man
in
blank
astonishment
kauaitshe
stared
at
topanashka
like
one
suddenly
aroused
by
a
wondrous
piece
of
news
tyope
is
right
continued
the
maseua
shyuamo
has
not
soil
enough
he
is
also
right
in
saying
that
there
is
not
room
enough
on
the
tyuonyi
for
making
new
plantations
the
delegate
from
the
turquoise
interjected
it
is
true
our
brethren
are
suffering
for
want
of
land
whereon
to
grow
their
corn
it
is
equally
true
that
tzitz
hanutsh
has
more
land
than
it
needs
and
it
is
well
that
shyuamo
should
ask
for
what
it
wants
and
not
leave
the
zaashtesh
forever
tyope
has
well
spoken
nothing
can
describe
the
effect
of
this
speech
even
the
chief
of
the
delight
makers
smiled
approvingly
a
hideous
satanic
grin
of
pleasure
he
felt
like
loving
the
speaker
that
is
provided
the
schemer
had
been
capable
of
liking
anybody
but
himself
the
eyes
of
tyope
sparkled
with
grim
delight
kauaitshe
and
tyame
hung
their
heads
and
reckoned
themselves
lost
forever
the
maseua
continued
still
addressing
the
principal
shaman
but
you
are
right
also
nashtio
yaya
when
you
say
that
it
is
tzitz
hanutsh
who
shall
decide
whether
or
not
it
wishes
to
part
with
some
of
its
fields
for
the
benefit
of
the
turquoise
people
both
tyope
and
the
koshare
naua
grew
very
serious
at
these
words
we
can
not
compel
the
water
people
to
give
up
any
of
their
soil
no
the
shikama
chayan
audibly
whispered
but
if
shyuamo
hanutsh
says
to
tzitz
hanutsh
will
give
you
such
and
such
things
that
are
precious
to
you
if
you
give
us
the
land
and
does
it
then
i
am
in
favour
of
compelling
tzitz
hanutsh
to
give
it
for
it
is
better
thus
than
that
the
tribe
should
be
divided
and
each
part
go
adrift
these
are
my
thoughts
sa
nashtio
yaya
the
hishtanyi
chayan
actively
nodded
assent
and
all
around
the
circle
approving
grunts
were
heard
the
old
man
speech
satisfied
the
majority
of
the
council
with
the
sole
exception
of
those
who
represented
the
clan
shyuamo
it
was
now
their
turn
to
become
excited
and
the
koshare
was
the
first
one
to
display
his
dissatisfaction
what
shall
we
give
he
muttered
we
are
poor
we
have
nothing
why
should
we
give
anything
for
that
which
does
not
help
the
others
it
will
help
us
but
only
us
and
nobody
else
we
give
nothing
because
we
have
nothing
he
hissed
at
last
and
looked
at
tyope
as
if
urging
him
to
be
firm
and
not
to
promise
anything
under
any
circumstances
tyope
remained
mute
the
words
of
the
maseua
appeared
to
leave
him
unmoved
but
tyame
the
man
of
the
eagles
became
incensed
at
this
refusal
on
the
part
of
the
turquoise
people
he
shouted
to
the
koshare
naua
what
you
will
give
nothing
why
are
you
koshare
then
why
are
you
their
chief
do
you
never
receive
anything
for
what
you
do
you
are
wealthy
you
have
green
stones
red
jewels
from
the
water
you
have
and
you
get
from
the
people
everything
that
is
precious
and
makes
the
heart
glad
you
alone
have
more
precious
things
than
all
the
rest
of
us
together
it
is
not
true
exclaimed
tyope
we
are
poor
screeched
the
koshare
naua
kauaitshe
now
interfered
he
had
recovered
from
his
stupor
and
yelled
you
have
much
you
are
wealthy
turning
against
tyope
he
shouted
to
him
why
should
we
before
all
the
others
give
you
the
soil
that
you
want
why
should
we
before
all
the
others
give
it
to
you
for
nothing
you
are
thieves
you
are
moshome
shutzuna
tiatiu
no
he
stamped
his
foot
on
the
ground
no
we
will
give
you
nothing
nothing
at
all
even
if
you
give
us
everything
that
the
koshare
have
schemed
and
stolen
from
the
people
the
commanding
voice
of
the
hishtanyi
sounded
through
the
tumult
hush
hush
but
it
was
of
no
avail
passions
were
aroused
and
both
sides
were
embittered
in
the
highest
degree
the
delegate
from
tanyi
jumped
up
yelling
why
do
you
want
the
ground
from
tzitz
alone
why
not
our
field
also
and
he
placed
himself
defiantly
in
front
of
tyope
the
member
from
huashpa
cried
are
the
water
people
perhaps
to
blame
for
the
drought
of
last
year
they
are
screamed
the
koshare
naua
rising
tapop
i
want
to
speak
make
order
silence
ordered
the
little
governor
but
nobody
paid
any
attention
satyumishe
maseua
now
shouted
the
principal
shaman
keep
order
the
nashtio
koshare
wants
to
speak
the
tall
man
rose
calmly
he
went
toward
the
cluster
of
wrangling
men
and
grasped
kauaitshe
by
the
shoulder
be
quiet
he
ordered
nobody
withstood
his
determined
mien
all
became
silent
topanashka
leaned
back
against
the
wall
his
gaze
fixed
on
the
koshare
everybody
was
in
suspense
in
expectation
of
what
the
naua
might
say
he
coughed
and
began
addressing
the
leading
shaman
yaya
hishtanyi
you
hear
that
the
water
people
refuse
to
give
us
the
land
that
we
so
much
need
they
ask
of
us
that
we
should
give
them
all
we
have
for
a
small
part
of
theirs
the
mot
tza
from
the
hanutsh
huashpa
has
asked
whether
tzitz
hanutsh
is
perhaps
the
cause
that
the
crops
failed
last
year
i
say
it
is
the
cause
of
it
how
so
cried
tyame
through
shotaye
their
sister
replied
the
old
man
slowly
it
was
not
silence
alone
that
followed
this
utterance
a
stillness
ensued
so
sudden
so
dismal
and
so
awful
that
it
seemed
worse
than
a
grave
every
face
grew
sinister
every
one
felt
that
some
dread
revelation
was
coming
tyope
held
his
head
erect
watching
the
face
of
the
old
maseua
topanashka
features
had
not
moved
he
was
looking
at
the
koshare
naua
with
an
air
of
utter
unconcern
the
hishtanyi
chayan
on
the
contrary
raised
his
head
and
the
expression
of
his
features
became
sharp
like
those
of
an
anxious
inquisitor
in
the
eye
of
the
shkuy
chayan
a
sinister
glow
appeared
he
also
had
raised
his
head
and
bent
the
upper
part
of
his
body
forward
the
shikama
chayan
assumed
a
dark
threatening
look
the
name
of
shotaye
had
aroused
dark
suspicions
among
the
their
chief
now
asked
slowly
measuredly
you
accuse
a
woman
of
having
done
harm
to
the
tribe
henceforward
he
and
his
two
colleagues
were
the
pivots
around
which
the
further
proceedings
were
to
revolve
the
tapop
was
forgotten
nobody
paid
attention
to
him
any
longer
i
do
i
say
that
shotaye
the
woman
belonging
to
tzitz
hanutsh
has
carried
destruction
to
the
tribe
in
what
way
in
preventing
the
rain
from
falling
in
season
and
she
has
succeeded
ejaculated
tyope
in
a
low
voice
so
low
that
it
was
not
heard
by
all
the
shkuy
chayan
continued
the
interrogatory
nobody
else
uttered
a
word
not
even
the
hishtanyi
spoke
for
the
present
the
latter
disliked
the
woman
as
much
as
any
of
his
colleagues
but
he
mistrusted
her
accusers
as
well
and
preferred
after
having
taken
the
initiatory
steps
to
remain
an
attentive
listener
and
observer
leaving
it
to
his
associates
to
proceed
with
the
case
the
shkuy
on
the
other
hand
was
eager
to
develop
matters
he
had
been
secretly
informed
some
time
ago
of
what
was
known
concerning
the
witchcraft
proceedings
of
shotaye
and
he
hated
the
woman
more
bitterly
than
any
of
his
colleagues
did
and
as
the
charge
was
the
preventing
of
it
very
directly
affected
his
own
functions
not
more
than
those
of
the
hishtanyi
who
is
but
quite
as
much
for
drought
not
only
affects
the
crops
it
exerts
quite
as
baneful
an
influence
upon
game
and
game
as
food
for
man
is
under
the
special
care
of
the
shkuy
chayan
he
is
the
great
of
the
hunt
drought
artificially
produced
as
the
indian
is
convinced
it
can
be
through
witchcraft
is
one
of
the
greatest
calamities
that
can
be
brought
upon
a
tribe
as
a
crime
it
is
worse
than
murder
for
it
is
an
attempt
at
wholesale
though
slow
extermination
the
sorcerer
or
the
witch
who
deliberately
attempts
to
prevent
becomes
the
object
of
intense
hatred
on
the
part
of
all
the
whole
cluster
of
men
assembled
felt
the
gravity
of
the
charge
they
sat
in
mute
silence
awaiting
the
result
of
the
investigation
which
the
shkuy
chayan
proceeded
to
carry
on
how
do
you
know
that
the
aniehna
he
emphasized
the
untranslatable
word
of
insult
and
his
voice
trembled
with
passion
has
worked
such
evil
to
the
people
the
query
was
directed
to
the
koshare
naua
the
latter
turned
to
tyope
saying
speak
satyumishe
nashtio
he
squatted
again
the
eyes
of
all
topanashka
excepted
who
did
not
for
a
moment
divert
his
gaze
from
the
chief
of
the
delight
makers
were
fixed
on
tyope
he
rose
and
dryly
said
i
saw
when
shotaye
koitza
and
say
koitza
the
daughter
of
our
father
the
maseua
everybody
now
looked
at
the
in
astonishment
dismay
or
sorrow
but
he
remained
completely
impassive
who
lives
in
the
abodes
of
tanyi
hanutsh
caused
the
black
corn
to
answer
their
questions
and
there
were
owl
feathers
along
with
the
corn
it
was
night
and
i
could
not
hear
what
they
said
it
was
in
the
beginning
of
winter
not
last
winter
but
the
winter
before
is
that
all
inquired
the
hishtanyi
chayan
in
turn
it
displeased
him
to
hear
that
tyope
had
been
eavesdropping
in
the
dark
the
man
had
no
business
in
the
big
house
at
night
i
know
also
continued
tyope
that
shotaye
gathered
the
feathers
herself
on
the
kauash
toward
the
south
did
you
see
her
yes
boldly
asserted
tyope
he
lied
for
he
dared
not
tell
the
truth
namely
that
the
young
navajo
was
his
informant
is
that
all
queried
the
hishtanyi
again
after
we
the
koshare
had
prayed
and
done
penance
in
our
own
kaaptsh
i
at
one
time
went
back
to
the
timbers
on
which
we
climb
up
to
the
cave
at
their
foot
below
the
rocks
i
found
this
he
drew
from
beneath
his
wrap
a
little
bundle
and
handed
it
to
the
shaman
who
examined
it
closely
and
gave
it
to
his
colleagues
who
subjected
the
object
to
an
equally
thorough
investigation
those
sitting
along
the
wall
bent
forward
curiously
until
at
last
the
bundle
was
turned
over
to
them
also
so
it
went
from
hand
to
hand
each
one
passing
it
to
the
next
with
sighs
and
marks
of
thorough
disgust
the
bundle
was
composed
of
owl
feathers
tied
to
a
flake
of
black
obsidian
i
found
a
second
one
quietly
said
tyope
pulling
forth
a
similar
bunch
now
the
council
gave
demonstrations
not
only
of
amazement
but
of
violent
indignation
the
shamans
and
topanashka
alone
remained
calm
both
bunches
were
given
to
the
tapop
who
placed
them
on
the
floor
before
him
the
hishtanyi
chayan
inquired
further
where
did
you
find
the
feathers
say
it
once
more
at
the
foot
of
the
rocks
where
we
ascend
to
our
estufa
on
did
you
see
who
put
them
there
no
when
do
you
think
they
were
placed
there
while
the
koshare
were
at
work
in
the
estufa
do
you
know
more
nothing
more
tyope
sat
down
and
the
interrogatory
was
over
it
was
as
still
as
a
grave
in
the
dingy
chamber
no
one
dared
even
to
look
up
for
the
matter
was
in
the
hands
of
the
yaya
and
they
were
still
thinking
over
it
the
demands
of
shyuamo
hanutsh
were
completely
forgotten
the
owl
feathers
had
monopolized
the
attention
and
the
thoughts
of
every
one
in
the
room
at
last
the
hishtanyi
chayan
rose
he
threw
a
glance
at
his
colleagues
who
understood
it
and
rose
also
then
the
great
spoke
in
a
hollow
tone
we
will
go
now
we
shall
speak
to
our
father
the
hotshanyi
that
he
may
help
us
to
consult
those
above
four
days
hence
we
shall
know
what
the
shiuana
think
and
on
the
night
following
he
turned
to
the
tapop
we
will
tell
you
here
what
to
do
in
the
meantime
he
uttered
these
words
like
a
solemn
warning
hush
let
none
of
you
exchange
one
word
on
what
we
have
heard
or
seen
let
none
of
you
say
at
home
know
of
something
evil
or
to
a
friend
things
are
going
on
in
the
tribe
be
silent
so
that
no
one
suspect
the
least
thing
and
that
the
sentence
of
the
shiuana
be
not
interfered
with
nasha
he
concluded
and
went
toward
the
exit
ere
leaving
the
room
however
he
turned
once
more
adding
and
you
go
also
each
one
for
himself
and
alone
let
no
one
of
you
utter
words
but
all
of
you
pray
and
do
penance
keep
open
your
ears
wide
awake
your
eye
and
closed
your
lips
with
this
the
shamans
filed
out
one
after
the
other
their
muffled
steps
were
heard
for
a
moment
as
they
grated
on
the
bare
rock
one
by
one
the
other
members
of
the
council
left
the
chamber
in
silence
each
wending
his
way
homeward
with
gloomy
thoughts
dismal
anticipations
and
dread
apprehension
filled
the
hearts
of
every
one
chapter
xii
at
the
time
when
the
tribal
council
of
the
queres
was
holding
the
stormy
session
which
we
have
described
in
the
preceding
chapter
quite
a
different
scene
was
taking
place
at
the
home
of
the
wife
of
tyope
that
home
we
know
belonged
to
hannay
the
woman
with
whom
tyope
had
consorted
after
his
separation
from
shotaye
and
it
was
also
the
dwelling
in
which
he
resided
when
other
matters
did
not
keep
him
away
the
tie
that
bound
tyope
to
his
second
wife
was
of
rather
a
sensual
nature
hannay
was
a
very
sensual
woman
but
in
addition
to
this
she
possessed
qualities
that
made
her
valuable
to
her
husband
she
was
extremely
inquisitive
listened
well
knew
how
to
inquire
and
was
an
active
reporter
on
her
side
there
was
no
real
affection
for
tyope
but
her
admiration
for
his
intellectual
qualities
so
far
as
she
was
able
to
appreciate
them
knew
no
bounds
it
amounted
almost
to
awe
their
connection
was
consequently
a
partnership
rather
than
anything
else
a
partnership
based
on
physical
affinities
on
mutual
interest
and
on
habit
of
the
higher
sort
of
sympathy
there
was
no
trace
neither
had
room
for
it
among
the
many
occupations
which
their
mode
of
life
and
manner
of
intercourse
called
forth
if
tyope
was
shrewd
and
cunning
and
if
he
made
of
his
own
woman
his
eye
ear
and
mouth
as
has
been
said
in
one
of
the
previous
chapters
hannay
was
not
a
fool
she
did
not
of
course
understand
anything
of
his
plans
and
schemes
and
he
never
thought
it
necessary
to
inform
her
but
she
knew
how
to
manage
him
whenever
anything
aroused
her
curiosity
she
contrived
to
gratify
this
sometimes
in
a
way
that
her
husband
failed
to
detect
by
drawing
from
his
talk
inferences
that
were
exceedingly
correct
and
which
he
had
no
thought
of
furnishing
for
tyope
knew
his
wife
weakness
he
knew
that
if
her
ears
and
her
eyes
were
sharp
her
tongue
was
correspondingly
swift
and
he
tried
to
be
as
guarded
as
possible
toward
her
on
any
topic
which
he
did
not
wish
to
become
public
property
nevertheless
hannay
succeeded
in
outwitting
her
husband
more
than
once
and
in
guessing
with
considerable
accuracy
things
that
he
did
not
regard
as
belonging
within
the
field
of
her
knowledge
so
for
instance
while
he
had
carefully
avoided
stating
to
her
the
object
of
the
council
she
nevertheless
had
put
together
in
her
own
mind
a
number
of
minor
points
and
hints
to
which
he
attached
no
importance
and
had
thus
framed
for
herself
a
probable
purpose
of
the
meeting
that
fell
not
much
short
of
the
real
truth
the
main
desire
that
occupied
hannay
mind
for
the
present
was
the
union
between
okoya
and
her
daughter
mitsha
okoya
had
unknown
to
himself
no
stronger
ally
than
the
mother
of
the
girl
the
motive
that
actuated
her
in
this
matter
was
simply
the
apparent
physical
fitness
of
the
match
and
the
momentary
advantages
that
she
considering
her
own
age
and
the
loose
nature
of
indian
marriages
might
eventually
derive
from
the
daily
presence
of
okoya
at
her
home
in
other
words
she
desired
the
youth
as
much
for
herself
as
for
her
child
and
saw
nothing
wrong
in
this
from
the
day
when
okoya
for
the
first
time
trod
the
roof
of
her
dwelling
in
order
to
protect
mitsha
she
had
set
her
cap
for
him
but
she
knew
that
there
was
no
love
on
the
part
of
tyope
for
the
relatives
of
okoya
paternal
or
maternal
and
she
was
too
much
afraid
of
him
to
venture
open
consent
to
a
union
that
might
be
against
his
wishes
in
her
mind
tyope
was
the
only
in
the
path
of
the
two
young
people
that
is
in
the
way
of
her
own
desires
she
had
consequently
set
to
work
with
a
great
deal
of
tact
and
prudence
in
approaching
tyope
about
the
matter
after
a
number
of
preparatory
skirmishes
she
at
last
ventured
to
tell
him
of
it
to
her
astonishment
he
took
it
quite
composedly
saying
neither
yes
nor
no
and
displaying
no
feeling
at
all
he
saw
not
the
least
objection
to
having
okoya
visit
her
house
as
often
as
he
might
please
in
fact
he
treated
the
matter
with
great
indifference
this
was
a
decided
relief
to
her
and
she
anxiously
waited
for
okoya
first
visit
to
impress
him
most
favourably
regarding
not
merely
herself
but
her
husband
tyope
indeed
did
not
attach
the
slightest
importance
to
okoya
personally
the
youth
had
no
value
for
him
at
present
he
did
not
dislike
him
he
did
not
notice
him
at
all
the
boy
was
as
unobjectionable
to
him
as
any
one
else
whom
he
did
not
need
for
his
purposes
but
there
were
points
connected
with
the
union
that
affected
tyope
designs
very
materially
and
these
would
come
out
in
course
of
time
although
he
foresaw
them
already
in
the
first
place
intermarriage
between
the
clans
of
tanyi
and
tyame
was
not
favourable
to
his
scheme
which
consisted
in
expelling
gradually
or
violently
four
clusters
tanyi
tyame
huashpa
and
tzitz
from
the
rito
the
cluster
he
wanted
to
get
rid
of
on
account
of
shotaye
whom
he
feared
as
much
as
he
hated
the
other
three
he
wished
to
dispossess
of
their
houses
which
were
the
best
secured
against
decay
on
the
tyuonyi
in
order
to
lodge
therein
his
own
relatives
and
their
partisans
had
okoya
aspired
to
the
hand
of
a
daughter
of
the
turquoise
clan
tyope
would
have
been
in
favour
of
his
pretensions
at
once
on
the
other
hand
okoya
was
very
young
he
might
be
flexible
if
properly
handled
and
in
case
the
boy
whose
father
was
already
a
koshare
and
completely
under
tyope
influence
could
be
induced
to
join
the
society
of
the
delight
makers
it
would
be
a
gain
fully
compensating
for
the
other
disadvantages
of
the
situation
one
more
koshare
in
tanyi
and
one
who
would
dwell
with
tyame
besides
after
marriage
was
a
gain
it
would
facilitate
the
realization
of
the
plan
of
a
disruption
of
tribal
ties
by
creating
disunion
among
the
clans
most
powerful
after
shyuamo
tyope
did
not
care
for
the
expulsion
of
certain
special
clusters
as
a
whole
provided
a
certain
number
and
a
certain
kind
of
people
were
removed
but
the
matter
of
making
a
koshare
out
of
okoya
was
a
delicate
undertaking
his
wife
had
already
suggested
as
much
to
him
and
he
had
insinuated
to
her
that
she
might
try
cautioning
her
at
the
same
time
against
undue
precipitation
finally
he
left
the
whole
matter
in
her
hands
without
uttering
either
assent
or
dissent
and
went
about
his
own
more
important
and
much
more
intricate
affairs
hannay
awaited
okoya
with
impatience
but
the
youth
had
not
appeared
again
he
was
afraid
of
tyope
and
also
afraid
of
her
the
warnings
of
his
mother
and
hayoue
he
had
treasured
deeply
and
these
warnings
kept
him
away
from
the
home
of
mitsha
still
he
longed
to
go
there
every
evening
since
the
one
on
which
say
encouraged
him
to
go
he
had
determined
to
pay
the
first
regular
visit
but
as
often
as
the
time
came
his
courage
had
abandoned
him
and
he
had
not
gone
and
yet
he
must
either
go
or
give
up
this
he
realized
plainly
there
might
be
a
possibility
of
some
other
youth
attempting
the
same
and
then
he
would
be
too
late
perhaps
there
was
no
thought
on
his
part
of
giving
up
he
felt
committed
and
yet
he
was
more
afraid
of
going
to
call
on
the
maiden
than
he
would
have
been
of
encountering
some
wild
beast
not
on
mitsha
account
oh
no
he
longed
to
meet
her
at
her
own
home
but
he
feared
both
her
parents
say
koitza
instinctively
noticed
her
son
trouble
and
she
became
apprehensive
lest
out
of
timidity
he
might
suffer
to
escape
him
what
she
now
more
and
more
regarded
as
a
golden
opportunity
at
last
on
the
evening
when
the
council
was
to
meet
a
fact
that
was
well
known
to
all
she
said
to
her
son
i
hear
that
sa
nashtio
maseua
is
going
to
the
uuityam
in
that
case
tyope
will
be
there
also
more
she
did
not
say
but
okoya
treasured
the
hint
and
made
no
remark
about
it
but
at
once
thought
that
the
time
had
come
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
maiden
after
the
sun
had
gone
down
he
went
out
and
leaned
against
the
northern
wall
of
the
big
house
gazing
steadily
at
the
dwellings
of
the
eagle
clan
there
were
too
many
people
about
yet
for
him
to
attempt
the
call
and
furthermore
it
was
so
early
that
the
council
could
hardly
have
assembled
by
the
light
of
the
moon
he
saw
clearly
the
movements
of
the
people
although
it
was
impossible
to
recognize
individuals
at
any
distance
the
boy
sat
down
and
waited
from
where
he
rested
he
could
not
fail
to
notice
when
the
delegates
of
the
clans
that
inhabited
the
big
house
left
for
the
council
and
that
would
be
the
signal
for
his
own
starting
his
heart
beat
he
felt
happy
and
yet
anxious
hope
and
doubt
both
agitated
his
mind
one
of
his
comrades
stealthily
approached
okoya
sat
down
on
the
ground
beside
him
threw
one
arm
around
his
shoulders
and
began
to
sing
loudly
okoya
chimed
in
and
the
two
shouted
at
the
top
of
their
untrained
voices
into
the
clear
still
night
such
is
the
custom
in
indian
villages
a
third
one
joined
them
finally
a
fourth
the
latter
lay
down
on
his
stomach
rested
his
elbows
on
the
ground
his
chin
in
both
hands
and
sang
in
company
with
the
others
soon
after
two
men
issued
from
the
gangway
and
walked
down
the
valley
at
last
another
went
in
the
same
direction
these
were
the
members
of
the
council
and
now
it
was
time
for
okoya
as
soon
as
the
song
reached
a
pause
he
stood
up
said
sha
and
turned
to
go
one
of
his
companions
seized
him
by
the
ankles
saying
it
is
too
early
for
you
to
go
to
see
the
girls
and
all
together
added
laughing
do
go
yet
later
on
we
will
all
go
together
but
okoya
stepped
firmly
on
the
arm
of
him
who
attempted
to
hold
him
back
so
that
the
boy
loosened
his
grip
then
he
jumped
into
the
passage
where
they
could
not
see
him
he
disliked
to
have
any
one
notice
that
he
went
to
see
mitsha
waiting
in
the
dark
passage
for
a
short
time
he
glided
out
at
last
on
the
side
farthest
from
where
the
boys
were
still
sitting
and
singing
crossed
the
ditch
into
the
high
corn
and
went
through
the
latter
upward
until
opposite
the
western
end
of
the
building
crossing
the
ditch
again
he
reached
the
slope
that
led
to
the
buildings
occupied
by
the
people
of
the
eagle
in
order
to
mislead
his
comrades
in
case
they
should
be
on
the
lookout
he
went
higher
up
along
the
cliffs
till
he
reached
the
caves
of
tzina
hanutsh
here
he
looked
back
the
three
boys
were
singing
lustily
the
same
monotonous
rhyme
at
the
same
place
where
he
had
left
them
from
the
rock
dwellings
of
the
turkey
people
there
was
a
gentle
declivity
to
the
houses
which
the
clan
tyame
had
constructed
against
the
perpendicular
wall
of
the
cliffs
okoya
walked
rapidly
now
that
he
had
started
he
longed
to
reach
mitsha
home
children
still
romped
before
the
houses
on
the
roofs
entire
families
were
gathered
loudly
talking
laughing
or
singing
some
of
them
had
even
built
small
fires
and
cooked
their
evening
meal
in
the
wonderfully
cool
and
invigourating
air
the
terrace
of
the
abode
whither
okoya
directed
his
steps
was
deserted
but
a
ray
of
light
passed
through
the
opening
in
the
front
wall
nothing
seemed
to
stir
inside
when
the
boy
approached
had
okoya
glanced
at
that
little
opening
he
might
have
discerned
a
woman
face
which
looked
out
of
it
for
a
moment
and
then
disappeared
within
had
he
stepped
closer
to
the
wall
he
might
have
heard
a
voice
inside
calling
out
in
a
low
tone
mitsha
he
is
coming
but
he
neither
looked
nor
listened
he
was
barely
able
to
think
his
feelings
overpowered
him
completely
wrapped
in
them
he
stood
still
lost
in
conflicting
sentiments
a
human
statue
flooded
by
the
silvery
moonlight
somebody
coughed
within
the
house
but
he
did
not
hear
it
again
the
face
appeared
in
the
small
round
okoya
had
his
face
turned
to
the
east
and
away
from
the
wall
of
the
house
at
last
the
spectator
within
thought
that
the
boy
musings
were
of
a
rather
long
duration
and
she
called
out
sa
uishe
opona
he
started
and
looked
toward
the
dwelling
but
saw
only
two
black
points
peeping
through
the
again
the
voice
spoke
why
do
you
come
in
mot
tza
now
he
became
conscious
that
hannay
was
calling
him
into
her
home
his
first
impulse
was
to
run
away
but
that
was
only
a
passing
thought
and
it
became
clear
to
him
that
he
had
reached
the
place
whither
he
was
going
and
furthermore
that
the
women
were
alone
without
a
word
of
reply
he
climbed
the
roof
and
nimbly
down
into
the
apartment
he
was
still
on
the
ladder
when
hannay
repeated
the
invitation
opona
sa
uishe
his
greeting
was
responded
to
by
a
loud
and
warm
raua
raua
from
the
mother
and
a
faint
slightly
tremulous
raua
from
another
voice
which
from
its
softness
could
only
be
that
of
mitsha
the
room
was
dark
for
the
fire
was
about
to
go
out
but
beside
the
hearth
cowered
a
female
figure
who
had
placed
fresh
wood
on
the
embers
and
was
fanning
them
with
her
breath
it
was
mitsha
at
the
entrance
of
the
visitor
she
quickly
stroked
back
the
hair
that
streamed
over
her
cheeks
and
turned
her
face
half
around
but
this
was
for
a
moment
only
as
soon
as
the
wood
caught
fire
and
light
began
to
spread
over
the
room
she
again
blew
into
the
flames
with
all
her
might
it
was
quite
unnecessary
for
the
fire
burned
lustily
hannay
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
wiping
her
mouth
with
the
back
of
her
hand
stepping
up
to
the
boy
she
said
you
have
not
been
here
for
a
long
time
mot
tza
it
sounded
like
a
friendly
reproach
he
modestly
grasped
her
fingers
breathed
on
her
hand
and
replied
i
could
not
come
you
did
not
want
to
come
said
the
woman
smiling
i
could
not
he
reiterated
you
could
had
you
wished
i
know
it
and
i
know
also
why
you
did
not
come
she
added
well
now
you
are
here
at
last
and
it
is
well
mitsha
give
your
friend
something
to
eat
the
significant
word
friend
fell
on
fertile
soil
it
eased
okoya
at
once
he
sat
down
closer
to
the
hearth
where
the
maiden
was
very
busy
in
a
rather
confused
manner
her
face
turned
from
him
still
as
often
as
the
strands
of
hair
accidentally
parted
on
the
left
cheek
she
shot
quick
at
him
okoya
balancing
himself
on
his
heels
quietly
observed
her
it
was
impossible
to
devote
to
her
his
whole
attention
for
her
mother
had
already
taken
her
seat
close
by
him
and
was
claiming
his
ear
she
offered
slight
attraction
to
the
eye
for
her
squatting
figure
was
not
beautiful
okoya
grew
lively
much
more
lively
than
he
had
been
on
his
first
visit
why
should
i
not
have
wanted
to
see
you
he
asked
i
will
tell
you
hannay
chuckled
because
you
were
afraid
afraid
he
cried
afraid
of
whom
but
within
himself
he
thought
the
woman
was
right
hannay
smiled
of
mitsha
she
said
adding
she
is
naughty
and
strong
a
peal
of
coarse
laughter
accompanied
this
stroke
of
wit
the
girl
was
embarrassed
she
hid
her
face
on
her
lap
okoya
replied
mitsha
does
not
bite
she
certainly
will
not
bite
you
the
mother
answered
causing
the
maiden
to
turn
her
face
away
does
she
bite
others
okoya
asked
again
hannay
laughed
aloud
and
from
the
corner
whither
mitsha
had
retreated
there
sounded
something
like
a
suppressed
laugh
also
it
amused
her
to
think
that
she
might
bite
people
her
mother
however
explained
no
mitsha
does
not
bite
but
if
other
boys
should
come
to
see
her
she
might
perhaps
strike
them
but
you
sa
uishe
the
woman
moved
closer
to
him
you
i
am
sure
she
will
not
send
away
is
it
not
so
mitsha
okoya
may
come
to
see
you
may
he
not
the
poor
girl
was
terribly
embarrassed
by
this
more
than
direct
question
and
okoya
himself
hung
his
head
in
confusion
he
pitied
the
maiden
for
having
such
a
mother
as
mitsha
gave
no
answer
hannay
repeated
speak
sa
uishe
will
you
send
this
mot
tza
away
as
you
do
the
others
no
breathed
the
poor
creature
thus
sorely
pressed
a
thrill
went
through
the
frame
of
okoya
he
looked
up
and
his
eyes
beamed
in
the
reflex
of
the
fire
the
woman
had
watched
him
with
the
closest
attention
and
nothing
escaped
her
notice
her
eyes
also
sparkled
with
pleasure
for
she
felt
sure
of
him
well
why
do
you
give
the
mot
tza
some
food
she
asked
her
daughter
again
on
your
account
he
has
walked
the
long
way
from
the
big
house
is
it
not
so
okoya
yes
the
boy
replied
innocently
quick
as
thought
mitsha
turned
around
and
her
eyes
beamed
on
him
for
an
instant
he
did
not
notice
it
and
she
forthwith
stepped
up
to
the
hearth
even
though
she
lacked
evening
toilette
mitsha
presented
a
handsome
picture
and
her
friend
became
absorbed
in
contemplation
of
the
lithe
graceful
form
she
lifted
the
pot
from
the
fire
placed
the
customary
share
of
its
contents
before
okoya
and
retired
to
a
corner
whence
she
soon
returned
with
a
piece
of
dried
regarded
as
a
great
treat
by
the
indians
because
it
has
a
sweet
taste
as
she
was
placing
the
dessert
on
the
floor
the
boy
extended
his
hand
and
she
laid
the
sweetmeat
in
it
instead
of
depositing
it
where
she
had
originally
intended
okoya
hand
closed
grasping
hers
and
holding
it
fast
mitsha
tried
to
extricate
her
fingers
but
he
clutched
them
in
his
stepping
back
she
made
a
lunge
at
his
upper
arm
which
caused
him
to
let
go
her
hand
at
once
laughing
she
then
sat
down
between
him
and
her
mother
the
ice
was
broken
you
are
very
strong
okoya
assured
her
rubbing
the
sore
limb
she
is
strong
indeed
her
mother
confirmed
she
can
work
well
too
have
you
any
green
paint
the
girl
asked
no
but
i
know
a
place
where
it
is
found
do
you
want
any
i
would
like
to
have
some
for
what
do
you
use
the
green
stone
next
year
i
want
to
paint
and
burn
bowls
and
pots
mitsha
had
no
thought
of
the
inferences
that
he
would
draw
from
her
simple
explanation
he
interpreted
her
words
as
very
encouraging
for
him
not
only
because
the
girl
understood
the
art
of
making
pottery
but
he
drew
the
conclusion
that
she
was
thinking
of
furnishing
a
household
of
her
own
hannay
improved
the
opportunity
to
still
further
praise
her
child
she
said
mitsha
does
not
only
know
how
to
paint
she
can
also
shape
the
uashtanyi
the
atash
and
the
asa
with
this
she
rose
went
to
the
wall
and
began
to
rummage
about
in
some
recess
okoya
had
meanwhile
taken
one
of
the
girl
hands
in
his
playing
with
her
dainty
fingers
which
she
suffered
him
to
do
see
here
the
woman
cried
and
turned
around
he
dropped
the
hand
and
hannay
handed
something
to
him
mitsha
made
this
then
she
sat
down
again
the
object
which
okoya
had
received
from
her
was
a
little
bowl
of
clay
round
and
decorated
on
its
upper
rim
with
four
truncated
and
graded
pyramids
that
rose
like
prongs
at
nearly
equal
intervals
the
vessel
was
neatly
finished
smooth
white
and
painted
with
black
symbolic
designs
there
was
nothing
artistic
in
it
according
to
our
ideas
but
it
was
original
and
quaint
okoya
gazed
at
the
bowl
with
genuine
admiration
placed
it
on
the
floor
and
took
it
up
again
holding
it
so
that
the
light
of
the
fire
struck
the
inside
also
he
shook
his
head
in
astonishment
and
pleasure
mitsha
moved
closer
to
him
with
innocent
pride
she
saw
his
beaming
looks
and
heard
the
admiring
exclamations
with
which
he
pointed
at
the
various
figures
painted
on
the
white
surface
then
she
began
to
explain
to
him
lightning
said
she
indicating
with
her
finger
a
sinuous
black
line
that
issued
from
one
side
of
the
arches
resting
on
a
heavy
black
dash
cloud
he
added
referring
to
the
arches
rain
concluded
the
maiden
pointing
at
several
black
streaks
which
descended
from
the
figure
of
the
clouds
both
broke
out
in
a
hearty
laugh
his
merriment
arose
from
sincere
admiration
hers
from
equally
sincere
joy
at
his
approbation
of
her
work
the
mother
laughed
also
it
amused
her
to
see
how
much
okoya
praised
her
daughter
skill
she
was
overjoyed
at
seeing
the
two
become
more
familiar
okoya
returned
to
his
former
position
placing
the
vessel
on
the
floor
with
tender
care
and
mitsha
resumed
her
sitting
posture
only
she
sat
much
nearer
the
boy
than
before
he
still
examined
the
bowl
with
wonder
who
taught
you
to
make
such
nice
things
he
asked
at
last
an
old
woman
from
mokatsh
look
and
she
took
up
the
vessel
again
pointing
to
its
outside
where
near
the
base
she
had
painted
two
horned
serpents
encircling
the
foot
of
the
bowl
tzitz
shruy
she
laughed
merrily
the
youth
laughed
so
did
the
women
all
three
enjoying
themselves
like
big
happy
children
for
whom
did
you
make
this
okoya
now
inquired
for
my
father
mitsha
proudly
replied
what
may
tyope
want
with
it
asked
the
boy
i
have
seen
uashtanyi
like
this
but
they
stood
before
the
altar
and
there
was
meal
in
them
it
was
when
the
shiuana
appeared
on
the
wall
what
may
sa
nashtio
use
this
for
i
do
know
mitsha
replied
and
her
eye
turned
to
her
mother
timidly
askance
and
with
an
expression
of
doubt
hannay
saw
here
an
excellent
pretext
to
put
in
a
word
of
her
own
which
she
had
wished
to
say
long
before
i
will
tell
you
sa
uishe
i
will
speak
to
you
as
i
would
to
my
own
child
the
artful
flattery
had
its
desired
effect
okoya
became
very
attentive
he
moved
closer
apparently
to
the
mother
in
reality
to
the
daughter
you
know
tyope
is
a
koshare
and
i
am
koshare
too
and
he
is
very
wise
a
great
man
among
those
who
create
delight
now
it
may
be
that
you
know
also
what
we
have
to
do
you
have
to
make
rain
said
the
youth
for
such
was
the
common
belief
among
the
younger
people
about
the
duties
of
the
society
hannay
and
mitsha
looked
at
each
other
smiling
the
of
the
boy
amused
them
you
are
right
the
woman
informed
him
after
we
have
prayed
fasted
and
done
penance
it
ought
to
rain
in
order
that
yamunyi
may
grow
to
koatshit
and
koatshit
ripen
to
yakka
in
these
words
she
artfully
shrouded
the
true
objects
of
the
koshare
it
enhanced
their
importance
in
the
eyes
of
the
uninitiated
listener
by
making
him
believe
that
the
making
of
rain
was
also
an
attribute
of
theirs
see
uak
she
proceeded
on
this
bowl
you
see
everything
painted
that
produces
rain
one
after
the
other
she
pointed
out
the
various
figures
here
you
see
the
tadpole
here
the
frog
here
the
and
the
fish
they
as
they
stand
here
pray
for
rain
for
some
of
them
cry
for
it
when
the
time
comes
others
live
in
the
water
which
is
fed
from
the
clouds
or
they
flit
above
the
pools
in
summer
here
is
the
cloud
and
lightning
and
she
turned
the
vessel
bottom
side
up
here
are
the
shiuana
themselves
pointing
at
the
two
horned
serpents
these
live
everywhere
where
tzitz
is
running
or
standing
in
this
uashtanyi
we
keep
meal
in
order
to
do
sacrifice
at
the
time
when
rain
ought
to
fall
the
pictures
of
the
shiuana
call
the
shiuana
themselves
so
you
see
what
the
koshare
want
with
this
thing
okoya
lips
had
slowly
parted
in
growing
astonishment
and
mitsha
to
whom
the
explanation
was
not
altogether
new
watched
the
expression
of
his
features
with
genuine
delight
and
when
you
pray
and
scatter
meal
out
of
this
pointing
to
the
bowl
does
the
rain
always
come
always
why
then
did
it
not
rain
last
summer
that
i
can
not
tell
you
said
the
woman
only
the
shiuana
know
besides
there
are
bad
people
who
stop
the
rain
from
coming
how
can
they
do
that
cried
both
okoya
and
mitsha
in
surprise
neither
of
them
having
heard
as
yet
of
such
a
thing
i
must
not
tell
you
that
said
hannay
with
a
mysterious
and
important
air
you
are
too
young
to
know
it
tell
me
okoya
her
voice
changed
with
the
change
of
the
subject
does
shotaye
koitza
often
come
to
see
your
mother
this
question
was
highly
imprudent
but
hannay
was
often
imprudent
smart
and
sly
in
a
certain
way
she
was
equally
thoughtless
in
other
matters
the
query
so
sudden
so
abrupt
and
so
uncalled
for
must
she
ought
to
have
foreseen
look
extremely
suspicious
and
yet
okoya
was
on
the
point
of
answering
she
was
at
our
home
a
few
days
ago
in
time
however
he
bethought
himself
of
the
warnings
she
had
received
and
replied
in
an
unsteady
tone
i
do
know
hannay
noticed
his
embarrassed
manner
and
saw
at
a
glance
that
he
was
forewarned
the
no
of
the
boy
told
her
yes
the
discovery
however
that
okoya
was
on
his
guard
was
rather
disagreeable
it
angered
her
so
much
that
her
first
impulse
was
to
send
him
away
but
she
soon
changed
her
mind
the
youth
was
obedient
and
if
now
he
obeyed
the
counsels
of
his
people
why
might
he
not
later
on
become
accustomed
to
submission
to
his
wife
people
also
at
all
events
he
was
and
according
to
hannay
conceptions
folk
were
always
silly
that
smart
but
persons
might
also
prove
extremely
silly
on
occasions
was
far
from
her
thoughts
and
yet
the
very
question
she
had
imprudently
put
to
okoya
was
an
instance
of
it
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
it
might
yet
be
problematic
whether
okoya
would
ever
become
a
traitor
to
his
own
people
she
could
not
conceive
how
anybody
might
be
different
from
her
and
from
tyope
and
of
course
she
had
no
doubt
concerning
his
ultimate
pliability
and
she
relied
also
upon
the
influence
mitsha
would
exert
upon
her
future
husband
taking
it
for
granted
that
her
child
had
the
same
low
standards
as
her
parents
that
child
hannay
regarded
merely
as
a
resource
as
valuable
property
marketable
and
to
be
disposed
of
to
the
most
suitable
bidder
in
her
eyes
okoya
appeared
as
a
very
desirable
one
she
saw
that
the
courtship
if
thus
it
may
be
called
was
advancing
most
favourably
and
thought
it
proper
now
that
the
ball
was
in
motion
to
allow
it
to
roll
alone
for
a
short
time
in
other
words
to
leave
the
house
under
some
pretext
abandoning
the
young
folk
to
themselves
after
her
return
she
intended
to
sound
okoya
again
though
in
a
more
skilful
manner
so
she
replaced
the
bowl
in
its
niche
and
went
toward
the
ladder
before
ascending
it
she
turned
and
said
i
will
be
back
soon
the
youth
smiled
and
she
gave
him
a
knowing
significant
wink
climbed
on
the
roof
and
down
to
the
ground
and
remained
standing
outside
for
a
while
until
she
thought
that
the
young
people
had
forgotten
about
her
then
she
glided
noiselessly
to
the
and
peeped
in
they
still
sat
by
the
hearth
examining
together
some
object
the
nature
of
which
she
could
not
discover
and
mitsha
was
explaining
something
to
the
boy
evidently
the
girl
was
showing
him
another
piece
of
her
handiwork
she
heard
them
laugh
merrily
and
innocently
they
were
like
children
at
play
satisfied
with
the
outlook
hannay
crept
off
to
a
dwelling
where
the
whole
family
was
gathered
on
the
she
took
her
seat
by
the
old
folk
and
joined
in
the
conversation
that
conversation
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
merest
gossip
indian
gossip
as
genuine
as
any
that
is
spoken
in
modern
society
with
this
difference
only
that
the
circle
of
facts
and
ideas
accessible
to
the
indian
mind
is
exceedingly
narrow
and
that
the
gossip
applies
itself
therefore
to
a
much
smaller
number
of
persons
and
things
but
it
is
as
venomous
the
backbiting
as
severe
and
merciless
among
indians
as
among
us
and
there
is
the
same
disposition
to
criticise
everything
that
does
not
strictly
pertain
to
us
and
to
our
favourites
the
same
propensity
to
slander
the
absent
and
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
as
those
present
so
long
as
they
are
within
hearing
distance
gossip
has
a
magic
power
it
fascinates
more
than
any
other
kind
of
conversation
it
fascinated
hannay
and
time
rolled
on
without
her
noticing
it
the
night
was
so
beautiful
so
still
so
placid
and
it
felt
so
comfortable
outside
on
this
terrace
whereon
the
moon
shone
so
brightly
that
hannay
sat
and
sat
listened
and
talked
until
she
had
forgotten
the
young
folk
at
home
suddenly
a
dark
shadow
covered
the
roof
the
change
was
so
abrupt
that
everybody
looked
around
what
a
moment
ago
was
plunged
in
the
silvery
bath
of
the
moon
rays
was
now
wrapped
in
transparent
darkness
but
the
valley
below
and
the
slope
in
front
were
as
softly
radiant
as
before
the
moon
had
disappeared
behind
one
of
the
cliffs
and
the
shadow
of
the
rocks
was
now
cast
over
the
houses
of
the
eagle
it
reminded
the
talkers
that
it
was
late
and
it
also
reminded
hannay
of
her
visitor
she
clambered
hurriedly
off
and
hastened
home
again
she
looked
through
the
circular
vent
it
was
dark
inside
and
still
after
listening
a
while
she
distinguished
regular
breathings
it
was
easy
to
recognize
them
as
those
of
mitsha
who
was
soundly
peacefully
asleep
hannay
as
soon
as
she
reached
the
floor
of
the
apartment
called
out
sa
uishe
no
reply
sa
uishe
no
answer
she
groped
about
in
the
dark
until
her
hands
touched
the
sleeping
form
she
pulled
the
girl
dress
and
shook
her
by
the
arm
until
she
sighed
and
moved
and
then
asked
sa
uishe
has
your
father
come
no
murmured
the
still
dreaming
child
where
is
okoya
he
has
left
will
he
come
again
oh
yes
breathed
mitsha
softly
then
she
turned
over
sighed
and
spoke
no
more
hannay
was
happy
the
boy
would
return
that
was
all
she
cared
for
she
really
liked
him
for
he
was
so
candid
so
good
and
so
with
such
a
much
was
possible
she
thought
okoya
could
certainly
be
moulded
to
become
a
very
useful
tool
to
her
as
well
as
to
tyope
the
woman
felt
elated
over
the
results
of
the
evening
she
felt
sure
that
notwithstanding
one
egregious
mistake
of
which
of
course
she
would
be
careful
not
to
speak
her
husband
would
be
pleased
with
her
management
of
affairs
it
was
long
after
midnight
when
that
husband
returned
to
the
roof
of
his
wife
and
hannay
was
already
fast
asleep
okoya
had
gone
long
before
hannay
thought
of
returning
he
went
home
happy
and
satisfied
that
mitsha
henceforth
belonged
to
him
and
yet
after
all
there
was
a
cloud
on
his
mind
not
a
very
threatening
one
yet
a
cloud
such
as
accompanies
us
everywhere
marring
our
perfect
happiness
whenever
we
fancy
we
have
attained
it
mitsha
had
said
to
him
while
they
were
alone
if
you
were
only
koshare
the
sanaya
would
give
me
to
you
okoya
thereupon
imagined
that
without
hannay
consent
he
could
never
obtain
the
maiden
on
the
other
hand
the
idea
of
joining
the
delight
makers
did
not
at
all
suit
him
he
feared
in
that
case
the
opposition
of
his
mother
after
he
had
returned
to
the
estufa
and
lain
down
among
the
other
boys
who
were
mostly
asleep
he
revolved
the
matter
in
his
mind
for
a
long
time
without
arriving
at
any
conclusion
whatever
had
he
been
less
sincere
and
less
attached
to
his
mother
such
scruples
would
hardly
have
troubled
him
had
he
owned
more
experience
he
would
have
known
that
his
apprehensions
were
groundless
and
that
hannay
could
not
if
she
wished
prevent
him
from
becoming
mitsha
husband
chapter
xiii
when
at
the
close
of
the
eventful
meeting
of
the
council
at
which
the
accusation
against
shotaye
and
say
koitza
had
fallen
like
a
thunderbolt
upon
the
minds
of
all
present
the
principal
shamans
warned
the
members
of
that
council
to
keep
strict
silence
and
to
fast
or
pray
that
reminder
was
not
to
be
understood
as
imposing
on
them
the
obligation
of
rigid
penitence
secrecy
alone
was
obligatory
it
remained
optional
with
each
how
far
he
would
carry
his
contrition
the
three
caciques
however
and
the
chief
had
to
retire
and
begin
rigorous
penitential
ceremonies
therefore
the
hishtanyi
chayan
had
said
that
he
was
going
to
speak
to
the
leading
penitents
at
once
some
of
the
fathers
of
the
tribe
however
took
the
matter
so
much
to
heart
that
they
obeyed
the
injunction
of
the
great
literally
and
took
to
sackcloth
and
ashes
as
soon
as
they
reached
home
their
motives
were
extremely
laudable
but
their
action
was
by
no
means
wise
they
lost
sight
of
what
the
shaman
had
strongly
insisted
upon
namely
that
none
of
them
should
by
displaying
particular
sadness
or
by
dropping
mysterious
hints
attract
attention
and
thus
lead
the
people
to
surmise
or
suspect
something
of
grave
import
the
shaman
knew
the
human
heart
well
at
least
the
hearts
of
his
tribe
but
with
all
his
shrewdness
he
overlooked
the
fact
that
the
very
recommendations
he
gave
had
fallen
on
too
fertile
ground
and
consequently
worked
more
harm
than
good
for
the
majority
of
the
councilmen
were
so
by
the
disclosures
of
tyope
and
of
the
koshare
naua
that
they
went
to
do
penance
with
a
zeal
that
could
not
fail
to
draw
the
attention
of
everybody
around
them
thus
kauaitshe
the
delegate
of
the
water
clan
and
tyame
he
of
the
eagles
and
several
others
considered
it
their
duty
to
fast
not
a
word
concerning
the
meeting
passed
their
lips
but
when
on
the
following
morning
each
one
of
them
retired
to
a
secluded
chamber
or
sat
down
in
a
corner
of
his
room
his
arms
folded
around
his
knees
speechless
motionless
when
he
refused
to
partake
of
the
food
which
his
wife
or
daughter
presented
to
him
when
he
persisted
in
this
attitude
quietly
and
solemnly
it
could
not
fail
to
attract
attention
the
father
brother
or
husband
fasted
whenever
the
indian
does
penance
it
is
because
he
has
something
heavy
on
his
mind
in
the
present
instance
as
it
happened
immediately
after
the
council
it
necessarily
led
to
the
inference
that
at
that
council
momentous
questions
must
have
been
discussed
and
also
that
these
questions
had
not
been
solved
otherwise
why
should
the
councilmen
fast
penitence
with
the
indian
is
akin
to
sacrifice
the
body
is
tormented
because
the
soul
is
beyond
human
reach
the
fasting
is
done
in
order
to
render
the
body
more
accessible
to
the
influence
of
the
mind
often
too
one
fasts
in
order
to
weaken
the
body
in
order
to
free
the
soul
from
its
thralls
and
bring
it
into
a
closer
relation
with
the
powers
regarded
as
supernatural
at
all
events
fasting
and
purifications
were
a
sure
sign
that
serious
affairs
were
in
process
of
development
and
such
proceedings
on
the
part
of
some
of
the
nashtio
could
not
fail
to
produce
results
the
opposite
of
what
the
shaman
had
intended
it
would
have
been
different
had
the
yaya
alone
retired
for
penitential
performances
nobody
would
have
been
struck
by
that
for
everybody
was
accustomed
to
see
them
at
work
as
such
voluntary
sacrifice
on
their
part
is
usually
called
it
was
their
business
but
since
the
nashtio
also
at
least
in
part
performed
similar
acts
it
could
not
help
producing
slowly
and
gradually
but
surely
a
tremendous
amount
of
gossip
and
a
corresponding
number
of
speculations
of
a
rather
gloomy
nature
that
gossip
was
started
in
the
of
tzina
hanutsh
the
stout
representative
of
the
water
clan
had
married
into
that
cluster
and
lived
consequently
among
them
with
his
wife
he
returned
home
wildly
excited
he
did
not
go
to
rest
at
all
and
when
his
family
awoke
they
saw
him
sitting
in
a
corner
as
soon
as
he
declined
to
eat
remaining
there
in
morose
silence
they
all
knew
that
he
was
grieving
and
chastising
himself
everybody
thought
the
nashtio
of
tzitz
since
his
return
from
the
council
is
doing
penance
what
can
have
happened
last
night
owing
to
the
custom
which
compels
a
man
to
marry
outside
of
his
own
clan
the
abodes
of
the
women
of
each
clan
were
frequented
by
their
husbands
they
of
course
belonged
to
different
clans
their
natural
confidants
were
not
their
wives
still
less
their
children
but
their
and
during
the
day
that
followed
the
council
a
man
whose
wife
was
from
the
turkey
people
but
who
himself
belonged
to
shyuamo
went
down
to
the
caves
of
the
latter
there
he
was
received
with
the
remark
the
nashtio
of
the
eagles
tyame
who
lives
with
us
is
fasting
he
replied
in
surprise
and
kauaitshe
is
also
doing
penance
a
third
whose
wife
belonged
to
the
bear
clan
was
within
hearing
and
he
quickly
added
the
delegate
from
dwells
with
kohaio
he
too
is
fasting
it
was
strange
people
said
nothing
but
they
shook
their
heads
and
separated
similar
things
occurred
in
the
houses
of
the
tanyi
there
the
representative
of
the
bear
clan
was
in
retirement
in
the
big
house
news
circulated
faster
than
anywhere
else
on
the
tyuonyi
and
in
a
very
short
time
it
became
known
that
not
only
the
nashtio
from
kohaio
but
especially
that
the
hishtanyi
chayan
and
the
cuirana
naua
were
secluding
themselves
step
by
step
the
news
got
abroad
and
went
from
clan
to
clan
while
the
people
compared
notes
without
expressing
opinions
at
sunset
it
was
known
all
over
the
rito
that
since
the
council
at
least
six
of
the
clan
delegates
were
fasting
besides
the
three
shamans
when
at
last
news
came
that
a
woman
had
gone
to
see
the
wife
of
the
chief
penitent
and
had
heard
from
her
that
her
husband
was
working
things
began
to
look
not
only
strange
but
portentous
in
an
indian
village
gossip
about
public
affairs
comes
to
a
as
soon
as
the
outlook
seems
very
grave
a
sullen
quiet
sets
in
the
hanutsh
recede
from
each
other
and
only
such
as
are
very
intimate
venture
to
interchange
opinions
and
even
they
only
with
the
utmost
caution
for
any
event
that
concerns
the
welfare
of
the
community
is
in
the
mind
of
the
aborigine
intimately
connected
with
the
doings
of
those
above
and
if
the
shiuana
were
to
hear
an
irrelevant
or
unpleasant
utterance
on
the
part
of
their
children
things
might
go
wrong
there
is
beside
the
barrier
between
clan
and
clan
the
mistrust
which
one
connection
feels
always
more
or
less
strongly
toward
the
others
instead
of
the
excitement
and
display
of
passion
that
too
often
accompany
the
preliminaries
of
great
events
in
civilized
communities
and
which
too
often
also
unduly
precipitate
them
among
the
indians
there
is
reticence
they
do
not
run
to
headquarters
for
information
they
make
no
effort
at
interviewing
the
officers
they
simply
and
sullenly
wait
this
patient
waiting
however
is
only
on
the
surface
in
strictly
intimate
circles
apprehensions
are
sometimes
uttered
and
opinions
exchanged
but
this
is
done
in
the
clan
and
rarely
in
the
family
in
the
present
case
it
was
not
reticence
alone
that
prevailed
the
conviction
that
great
things
might
be
brought
to
light
soon
caused
uneasiness
rather
than
anything
else
apprehensions
were
increased
by
the
fact
that
only
a
part
of
the
dignitaries
of
the
tribe
were
doing
penance
the
koshare
naua
was
not
fasting
neither
was
topanashka
and
tyope
went
about
with
the
utmost
unconcern
members
of
the
clans
whose
delegates
kept
secluded
became
suspicious
of
the
fact
that
their
nashtio
appealed
more
particularly
to
the
higher
powers
and
hence
that
his
constituents
such
was
their
conclusion
were
in
danger
of
something
as
yet
concealed
from
the
people
suspicion
led
to
envy
and
finally
to
wrath
against
such
as
appeared
to
be
free
from
the
necessity
of
intercession
tyope
had
thrown
a
firebrand
among
the
tribe
and
the
fire
was
smouldering
yet
but
it
was
merely
a
question
of
time
for
the
flames
to
burst
forth
it
was
even
easy
to
guess
when
it
must
occur
for
no
such
fast
can
last
longer
than
four
days
at
their
expiration
if
not
before
all
doubts
must
be
dispelled
with
this
absolute
certainty
the
people
rested
not
content
but
submitting
to
the
inevitable
only
two
men
among
the
queres
knew
the
whole
truth
of
the
matter
and
these
were
tyope
and
the
old
koshare
naua
they
watched
with
apparent
calmness
but
with
the
greatest
attention
the
approach
of
the
storm
which
they
had
prepared
everything
went
on
to
their
hearts
content
they
did
not
need
to
do
penance
for
their
sinister
plans
were
advancing
satisfactorily
and
a
third
at
the
rito
although
unknown
to
them
also
began
to
see
the
truth
gradually
with
a
distinctness
that
was
fearful
that
was
crushing
to
him
that
man
was
the
head
topanashka
tihua
a
series
of
logical
deductions
brought
him
to
ravel
step
by
step
the
game
that
was
being
played
he
saw
now
why
tzitz
hanutsh
had
been
made
to
bear
the
first
assault
it
was
on
account
of
shotaye
but
as
the
demand
was
put
it
involved
ultimately
the
question
of
residence
and
consequently
an
expulsion
of
the
water
people
this
could
never
have
been
merely
on
account
of
one
woman
and
in
order
to
get
rid
of
her
since
it
was
so
easy
to
put
shotaye
out
of
the
way
by
the
mere
accusation
of
witchcraft
that
accusation
itself
appeared
to
the
old
man
to
be
a
mere
pretext
and
nothing
else
to
expel
the
small
water
clan
alone
was
not
their
object
either
his
daughter
the
child
of
tanyi
was
also
implicated
and
with
this
thought
came
a
flash
of
light
not
one
clan
alone
but
several
were
to
be
removed
and
as
he
now
saw
plainly
mostly
the
clans
occupying
houses
which
were
not
exposed
to
the
dangers
which
threatened
the
from
the
crumbling
rock
tzitz
had
only
served
as
an
for
their
design
that
the
should
make
room
for
the
others
the
more
topanashka
thought
over
it
the
more
he
felt
convinced
that
he
was
right
and
the
stronger
his
convictions
the
more
he
saw
that
the
plans
of
the
two
fiends
tyope
and
the
naua
were
likely
to
succeed
they
were
bad
men
they
were
dangerous
men
but
they
certainly
had
a
pair
of
very
subtle
minds
was
it
possible
to
defeat
their
object
other
men
differently
constituted
from
topanashka
might
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
best
to
leave
the
rito
with
their
people
at
once
without
any
further
wrangling
and
make
room
peaceably
to
this
he
could
never
consent
none
of
his
relatives
or
their
friends
should
be
sacrificed
to
the
intrigues
of
the
turquoise
people
rather
than
yield
he
was
firmly
determined
that
the
turquoise
people
themselves
should
go
but
only
after
they
had
done
their
worst
it
was
true
as
tyope
had
said
that
a
division
of
the
tribe
entailed
a
dangerous
weakening
of
both
fragments
but
then
if
it
must
be
what
else
could
be
done
still
he
was
in
hopes
that
the
shiuana
would
not
consent
to
a
separation
and
in
his
firm
belief
in
the
goodness
of
those
above
he
resolved
when
the
time
came
to
do
his
utmost
for
the
preservation
of
peace
and
unity
but
it
was
a
crushing
weight
to
him
not
a
soul
had
he
with
whom
to
communicate
for
his
lips
were
sealed
not
one
whom
he
might
enlighten
and
prepare
for
the
hour
of
the
crisis
and
he
felt
unconsciously
that
he
was
the
pillar
on
which
rested
the
safety
of
his
people
he
and
the
shiuana
the
feeling
was
no
source
of
pride
it
was
a
terrible
load
which
he
longed
in
vain
to
share
with
some
one
else
topanashka
did
not
attempt
to
do
penance
externally
he
was
too
shrewd
for
that
but
he
prayed
as
much
as
any
one
prayed
for
light
from
above
for
the
immense
courage
to
keep
silent
to
hope
and
to
wait
the
news
that
kauaitshe
the
delegate
from
tzitz
hanutsh
was
fasting
had
reached
the
of
his
cluster
late
in
the
afternoon
zashue
had
carried
it
thither
communicating
the
intelligence
secretly
to
his
mother
and
sister
they
were
speaking
of
it
the
old
woman
with
apprehensions
and
zashue
in
his
usual
frivolous
manner
when
hayoue
entered
do
you
know
said
he
that
the
nashtio
of
tyame
is
doing
penance
so
does
ours
remarked
zashue
growing
serious
he
began
to
see
matters
in
a
different
light
what
may
this
all
be
about
wondered
the
younger
brother
the
elder
brother
shrugged
his
shoulders
sighed
and
rubbed
his
eyes
and
all
four
kept
silent
is
it
perhaps
from
the
uuityam
asked
hayoue
and
his
mother
exclaimed
surely
it
is
then
something
must
have
occurred
continued
hayoue
and
with
a
at
his
brother
i
wonder
if
tyope
is
fasting
also
zashue
denied
it
positively
and
added
the
naua
is
out
of
doors
in
that
case
it
is
our
people
again
who
have
to
suffer
his
passion
was
aroused
he
cried
rather
than
spoke
the
shyuamo
never
suffer
anything
who
knows
but
the
shuatyam
tyope
and
the
old
one
have
again
done
something
to
harm
us
ere
zashue
could
reply
to
this
sally
the
young
man
had
left
the
cave
when
hayoue
stood
outside
he
noticed
shotaye
sitting
on
her
doorstep
guatzena
sam
m
he
called
over
to
her
raua
a
the
woman
answered
extending
her
hand
toward
him
as
if
she
wished
to
give
him
something
he
went
over
to
her
took
the
object
and
looked
at
it
it
was
the
rattle
of
a
snake
where
did
you
get
this
he
asked
i
found
it
above
where
a
rattlesnake
had
been
eaten
do
you
want
it
he
shook
the
rattle
and
inquired
will
you
give
it
to
me
yes
it
is
well
and
now
i
will
tell
you
something
that
you
do
know
yet
our
father
kauaitshe
is
fasting
he
is
right
shotaye
remarked
it
will
make
him
leaner
both
laughed
but
hayoue
said
with
greater
earnestness
tyame
is
doing
penance
also
then
he
is
with
his
woman
from
shyuamo
flippantly
observed
shotaye
it
will
make
turquoises
cheaper
she
turned
away
with
an
indifferent
air
her
careless
manner
struck
the
young
man
and
when
he
saw
that
she
would
not
speak
but
only
gazed
at
the
sky
he
went
off
with
the
present
he
had
received
he
felt
differently
he
took
the
matter
very
seriously
he
directed
his
steps
toward
the
tall
building
where
it
might
be
possible
to
ascertain
something
else
hayoue
was
afraid
of
the
turquoise
people
and
their
designs
shotaye
was
far
from
indifferent
to
the
piece
of
news
which
hayoue
had
brought
to
her
but
neither
was
she
surprised
she
expected
as
much
it
was
therefore
easy
for
her
to
appear
perfectly
calm
and
unconcerned
she
was
fully
convinced
that
her
case
had
been
the
subject
of
last
discussion
in
the
council
but
the
fact
that
the
delegates
were
doing
penance
proved
that
the
matter
was
still
pending
and
that
no
conclusion
had
been
reached
there
was
consequently
time
before
her
still
and
the
reprieve
amounted
to
about
four
days
she
had
time
to
reflect
and
to
prepare
her
course
of
action
the
sooner
she
was
alone
and
left
to
her
own
musings
the
better
and
that
was
why
she
turned
away
so
abruptly
from
the
young
man
hayoue
drew
from
her
manner
the
inference
that
the
woman
busied
herself
with
thoughts
entirely
foreign
to
his
own
and
did
not
wish
to
be
disturbed
but
as
soon
as
he
turned
to
go
she
watched
him
through
one
corner
of
her
eye
when
he
was
far
enough
away
she
rose
and
slowly
crept
back
into
her
dwelling
we
need
not
follow
the
train
of
thought
that
occupied
shotaye
it
was
in
the
main
the
same
that
had
filled
her
mind
during
the
last
week
one
thing
was
certain
she
was
not
silly
enough
to
fast
she
would
not
commit
such
a
blunder
neither
would
she
call
on
say
koitza
she
regarded
her
companion
in
danger
as
sufficiently
advised
and
felt
sure
that
the
wife
of
zashue
was
prepared
for
any
event
why
then
disturb
her
it
might
only
lead
her
into
committing
some
disastrous
blunder
without
shotaye
direct
knowledge
say
was
sure
to
do
nothing
at
all
and
that
was
the
best
for
both
for
the
present
all
that
could
be
done
was
to
remain
absolutely
quiet
and
to
wait
hayoue
on
the
other
hand
was
not
so
philosophical
as
he
strolled
down
the
valley
his
mind
was
deeply
agitated
it
seemed
clear
to
him
that
a
grave
question
had
been
propounded
at
the
council
and
it
could
only
have
originated
through
some
deviltry
on
the
part
of
the
evil
spirits
of
the
turquoise
clan
tyope
and
the
old
naua
this
made
him
very
angry
and
he
vowed
within
himself
that
when
the
time
came
he
would
take
a
very
active
part
in
the
proceedings
he
would
rather
have
commenced
the
fray
at
once
by
slaughtering
tyope
and
his
accomplice
but
then
it
was
not
altogether
the
thing
to
do
neither
would
it
do
to
go
about
and
inquire
at
random
nothing
was
left
to
him
but
to
have
patience
and
wait
waiting
however
did
not
interfere
with
his
disposition
to
talk
with
a
nature
as
outspoken
as
that
of
hayoue
it
was
impossible
to
wait
without
saying
something
to
somebody
about
it
but
to
whom
at
home
he
could
not
speak
for
there
was
zashue
and
he
was
never
impartial
when
any
one
of
the
koshare
was
concerned
okoya
would
be
far
preferable
and
he
determined
upon
looking
him
up
his
nephew
was
not
in
the
big
house
and
hayoue
went
out
to
the
the
indian
goes
to
his
field
frequently
not
in
order
to
work
but
simply
to
lounge
to
seek
company
or
to
watch
the
growing
crops
okoya
was
in
his
father
plot
sitting
comfortably
among
the
corn
but
it
was
not
the
plantation
that
occupied
his
thoughts
they
were
with
mitsha
and
he
pondered
over
what
she
had
told
him
the
night
before
and
how
he
might
succeed
in
making
her
his
beyond
cavil
looking
up
accidentally
he
discerned
the
form
of
his
uncle
coming
toward
him
and
his
face
brightened
he
motioned
hayoue
to
come
and
this
time
hayoue
was
eager
to
meet
okoya
the
uncle
wore
a
gloomy
face
and
the
nephew
noticed
it
at
once
but
he
thought
that
if
his
friend
intended
to
confide
in
him
he
would
do
so
spontaneously
he
had
not
long
to
wait
hayoue
sat
down
alongside
of
him
and
began
do
you
know
where
sa
umo
is
the
maseua
he
is
at
home
i
think
at
least
he
was
there
when
i
went
away
is
he
doing
penance
okoya
stared
at
hayoue
in
astonishment
no
he
ate
with
us
why
should
he
fast
do
you
know
hayoue
continued
to
inquire
that
the
nashtio
of
tzitz
and
the
nashtio
of
tyame
are
fasting
i
did
not
but
i
know
that
the
hishtanyi
chayan
is
at
work
hayoue
extended
his
neck
and
pricked
up
his
ears
what
said
he
the
yaya
also
indeed
the
cuirana
naua
also
did
not
you
know
it
you
are
a
nice
cuirana
the
uncle
shook
his
head
that
is
bad
very
bad
indeed
muttered
he
okoya
was
perplexed
at
last
his
curiosity
overcame
all
diffidence
and
he
asked
what
is
it
satyumishe
nashtio
do
you
know
of
anything
evil
hayoue
looked
at
him
and
said
okoya
you
and
i
are
alike
when
your
heart
is
heavy
you
come
to
me
and
say
heart
is
sad
help
me
to
make
it
light
again
and
when
i
feel
sorrow
i
go
to
you
and
tell
you
of
it
when
you
came
to
me
up
there
he
pointed
to
the
west
it
was
dark
in
your
heart
it
is
night
in
mine
the
speech
both
astonished
and
pleased
the
boy
he
felt
pride
in
the
elder
confidence
but
was
too
modest
to
express
it
so
he
merely
replied
nashtio
i
am
very
young
and
you
are
much
wiser
than
i
how
can
i
speak
so
that
your
heart
may
be
relieved
you
know
how
i
must
speak
and
when
you
tell
me
i
will
try
and
do
it
he
gazed
into
hayoue
features
with
a
timid
doubting
look
he
could
hardly
conceive
that
his
uncle
really
needed
advice
from
him
it
was
hayoue
turn
to
sigh
slowly
he
said
last
night
the
uuityam
was
together
and
the
yaya
and
the
nashtio
are
fasting
okoya
innocently
asked
why
do
they
fast
that
is
just
what
i
want
to
know
hayoue
impatiently
exclaimed
but
surely
it
bodes
nothing
good
why
should
the
wise
men
want
something
that
is
evil
said
the
other
in
surprise
you
are
young
mot
tza
you
are
like
a
child
else
you
would
not
ask
such
a
question
the
wise
men
are
doing
penance
not
because
they
intend
harm
but
in
order
to
prevent
the
people
from
being
harmed
do
you
understand
me
now
it
began
to
dawn
on
okoya
mind
still
he
had
not
fully
grasped
his
uncle
meaning
who
is
going
to
do
evil
things
to
us
are
there
moshome
about
hayoue
was
struck
by
the
remark
he
had
not
thought
of
this
possibility
it
might
be
that
the
older
men
had
learned
something
of
the
approach
or
presence
of
navajos
a
few
moments
of
reflection
however
convinced
him
of
the
utter
improbability
of
the
suggestion
if
there
were
danger
of
this
the
warriors
to
whom
he
belonged
that
is
the
special
group
of
war
magicians
would
have
been
the
first
to
be
informed
of
it
and
they
would
all
be
now
in
the
estufa
preparing
themselves
for
duty
and
the
maseua
first
of
all
instead
of
it
the
old
man
was
up
and
about
as
usual
no
it
could
not
be
and
he
accordingly
said
it
may
be
that
some
sneaking
wolf
is
lurking
about
but
i
do
not
believe
it
see
here
satyumishe
i
belong
to
those
who
know
of
war
and
i
should
certainly
have
heard
if
there
were
any
signs
of
the
dinne
and
our
father
the
maseua
would
not
have
remained
about
the
big
house
no
umo
it
is
not
on
account
of
the
moshome
that
the
yaya
and
nashtio
take
no
food
but
if
there
are
no
moshome
about
whence
could
there
come
danger
to
us
from
there
and
hayoue
pointed
to
distant
cliffs
where
some
of
the
of
shyuamo
were
visible
at
the
diminutive
openings
in
the
rock
why
from
there
from
shyuamo
hanutsh
what
can
shyuamo
want
to
do
harm
for
hayoue
grew
really
impatient
you
think
of
nothing
else
but
your
girl
he
grumbled
have
you
forgotten
already
what
i
told
you
of
tyope
and
of
that
old
the
naua
it
thundered
in
the
distance
a
shower
was
falling
south
of
the
rito
and
its
thunder
sounded
like
low
subterranean
mutterings
hayoue
called
out
do
you
hear
the
shiuana
they
remind
you
of
what
i
said
the
parts
were
reversed
it
was
now
the
uncle
who
reminded
the
nephew
of
the
voices
from
the
higher
world
okoya
hung
his
head
listen
to
me
continued
hayoue
i
know
that
you
do
not
like
it
that
i
speak
against
tyope
but
i
am
right
nevertheless
he
is
a
bad
man
and
a
base
man
he
only
looks
at
what
he
desires
and
to
the
welfare
of
his
hanutsh
toward
others
he
is
and
his
companion
is
worse
yet
the
old
fiend
yes
but
what
can
they
gain
by
doing
evil
to
others
okoya
asked
i
do
know
how
can
i
know
it
then
i
am
much
younger
much
less
wise
than
you
hayoue
saw
the
candour
of
the
boy
and
it
troubled
him
it
was
true
okoya
was
too
young
yet
too
inexperienced
he
could
not
fully
understand
what
hayoue
was
suspecting
and
could
not
give
him
any
light
or
advice
it
was
useless
to
press
him
any
further
but
one
thing
hayoue
had
achieved
at
all
events
he
had
enjoyed
an
opportunity
to
vent
his
feelings
in
full
confidence
and
that
alone
afforded
him
some
relief
after
musing
a
while
he
spoke
again
let
it
be
what
it
may
i
tell
you
this
much
brother
be
careful
and
now
especially
speak
to
nobody
of
what
i
have
told
you
and
should
you
go
to
see
mitsha
keep
your
ears
open
and
your
mouth
shut
i
can
not
find
anybody
to
speak
to
except
you
and
the
maseua
but
our
father
i
dare
not
ask
for
when
the
others
are
fasting
topanashka
lips
are
closed
until
the
time
comes
to
act
meanwhile
brother
we
must
wait
i
am
going
back
to
the
katityam
for
it
is
not
good
to
run
about
and
pry
nobody
knows
anything
but
the
yaya
and
the
nashtio
and
these
do
not
speak
to
us
with
these
words
he
rose
and
left
okoya
alone
much
as
the
latter
was
attached
to
his
father
brother
he
was
still
glad
to
see
him
go
the
sinister
hints
which
hayoue
had
dropped
were
as
good
as
incomprehensible
to
him
that
the
zaashtesh
could
be
damaged
through
some
of
its
own
people
he
could
not
conceive
still
he
believed
it
for
hayoue
had
said
so
and
it
must
be
true
but
it
was
equally
true
that
okoya
thoughts
were
with
his
own
affairs
exclusively
and
his
uncle
talk
affected
him
mainly
on
that
score
it
increased
his
already
uneasy
feelings
the
fear
that
mitsha
would
be
given
him
only
on
condition
that
he
became
koshare
was
now
stronger
than
ever
and
his
prospects
appeared
still
further
complicated
in
the
light
of
disclosures
nevertheless
nothing
was
absolutely
certain
so
far
and
he
could
not
precipitate
matters
in
his
case
too
there
was
nothing
left
but
to
wait
the
shower
which
was
sending
floods
of
moisture
into
the
valleys
farther
south
only
grazed
the
rito
sending
a
short
and
light
rain
upon
its
growing
crops
it
surprised
zashue
upon
his
return
to
the
big
house
and
drove
him
to
shelter
at
his
own
that
is
his
wife
home
he
did
not
really
care
to
go
there
for
since
the
time
when
he
and
tyope
had
searched
the
rooms
zashue
had
kept
rather
away
from
his
spouse
he
did
not
suspect
her
any
longer
but
the
very
conviction
on
his
part
that
she
was
innocent
and
that
consequently
he
had
wronged
her
kept
him
away
from
her
presence
the
weaker
a
man
is
the
less
he
likes
to
acknowledge
guilt
he
feels
ashamed
of
himself
but
will
not
acknowledge
it
the
indian
in
this
respect
is
as
tough
as
other
people
if
not
tougher
to
beg
pardon
for
an
offence
committed
is
to
him
a
very
difficult
task
he
is
a
child
and
children
rarely
make
atonement
unless
compelled
they
conceal
their
guilt
and
so
does
the
indian
if
he
has
wronged
any
one
the
redman
persists
in
acting
as
if
nothing
had
happened
or
he
pouts
or
avoids
the
party
offended
zashue
did
not
pout
but
he
avoided
his
wife
dwelling
as
much
as
possible
and
felt
embarrassed
when
there
or
as
had
been
the
case
a
few
days
ago
when
the
matter
of
okoya
wooing
was
discussed
he
availed
himself
of
the
first
pretext
to
take
leave
it
was
different
he
had
to
go
there
for
shelter
say
received
him
in
her
usual
way
almost
without
a
word
but
with
a
look
that
was
at
once
friendly
searching
and
unsteady
it
was
dark
in
the
inner
room
and
zashue
failed
to
notice
his
wife
glance
say
also
had
heard
of
the
fasts
and
penitence
to
which
some
of
the
officers
of
the
tribe
had
submitted
and
she
rightly
surmised
that
the
accusation
against
shotaye
and
against
herself
perhaps
had
at
last
been
made
and
was
the
cause
of
such
unusual
proceedings
but
shotaye
had
judged
her
well
when
she
decided
upon
not
troubling
say
with
a
visit
it
was
unnecessary
for
say
took
everything
calmly
and
with
perfect
composure
the
positive
assurance
of
shotaye
that
she
was
safe
and
still
more
the
words
of
her
father
to
the
same
effect
had
completely
reassured
the
woman
she
looked
forward
to
coming
events
with
anxious
curiosity
rather
than
with
apprehension
still
as
her
husband
unexpectedly
entered
her
dwelling
she
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
sound
him
and
to
find
out
if
possible
what
he
thought
about
affairs
while
kneading
the
she
therefore
asked
in
a
quiet
cool
manner
hachshtze
do
you
know
that
the
nashtio
are
fasting
all
of
them
i
do
know
she
replied
going
on
with
her
work
and
yet
i
know
this
much
that
sa
nashtio
does
not
fast
he
ate
with
us
and
is
going
about
as
usual
what
may
it
all
mean
he
inquired
of
her
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
asked
does
tyope
do
penance
in
view
of
the
intimate
relations
existing
between
tyope
and
zashue
this
was
a
very
natural
question
and
yet
it
stung
zashue
he
interpreted
it
as
a
covert
thrust
but
as
he
bethought
himself
of
the
charges
which
hayoue
had
uttered
against
the
delegate
from
shyuamo
a
whole
series
of
ideas
rose
within
him
so
suddenly
and
so
far
from
pleasant
or
comforting
to
himself
that
he
forgot
the
conversation
and
inclined
his
head
in
thought
say
koitza
was
too
much
absorbed
by
her
work
to
notice
the
change
in
her
husband
manner
at
once
after
a
few
moments
of
silence
she
reiterated
her
question
zashue
appeared
to
wake
up
he
started
saying
i
do
know
but
why
do
you
ask
this
the
woman
realized
that
her
inquiry
might
have
been
imprudent
but
with
great
assurance
explained
because
he
is
nashtio
and
a
great
one
at
that
shyuamo
is
a
strong
hanutsh
and
what
it
wants
will
be
done
it
alone
can
do
more
than
tzitz
and
tanyi
together
the
quick
bold
apparently
unpremeditated
reply
relieved
zashue
of
an
undefined
feeling
of
suspicion
that
had
arisen
within
him
during
his
moment
of
thoughtfulness
he
had
been
led
from
the
accusations
of
hayoue
against
tyope
unconsciously
to
the
accusation
which
tyope
had
launched
before
against
shotaye
and
his
own
wife
quick
as
lightning
it
flashed
upon
his
mind
that
that
accusation
had
perhaps
been
formulated
again
and
this
time
officially
before
the
council
and
if
say
were
innocent
as
he
still
believed
why
did
she
inquire
about
him
who
was
the
originator
of
it
he
did
not
attribute
her
query
to
a
guilty
conscience
for
the
indian
has
but
a
very
dim
notion
about
human
conscience
if
he
thinks
of
it
at
all
he
would
have
gone
further
and
have
seen
in
the
utterance
of
his
wife
the
evidence
of
some
positive
knowledge
did
say
know
anything
about
the
real
object
of
the
stormy
visit
which
he
and
tyope
paid
to
her
home
during
the
dance
of
the
ayash
tyucotz
her
ready
reply
to
his
mistrustful
inquiry
had
allayed
suspicions
as
to
her
guilt
for
the
time
being
but
on
the
other
hand
he
felt
strong
misgivings
that
she
had
found
out
something
either
of
what
the
koshare
said
or
thought
concerning
her
or
about
the
attempt
which
tyope
and
he
had
failed
in
one
thing
however
grew
to
be
more
and
more
certain
in
his
judgment
namely
that
a
charge
proffered
against
shotaye
was
probably
the
cause
of
the
extraordinary
fastings
going
on
among
the
tribal
heads
more
he
could
not
surmise
still
less
find
out
but
he
determined
upon
being
very
guarded
toward
his
wife
hereafter
say
on
her
side
had
a
similar
feeling
toward
him
the
breach
which
social
customs
already
established
between
man
and
wife
was
gradually
but
surely
widening
still
they
continued
to
talk
quietly
no
one
seeing
them
together
in
the
dingy
kitchen
would
have
suspected
a
lack
of
harmony
or
discontent
much
less
the
sinister
preoccupations
lurking
in
the
heart
of
each
both
felt
that
it
was
useless
that
they
must
abide
their
time
avoid
imprudent
words
and
queries
conceal
from
each
other
their
misgivings
and
wait
chapter
xiv
more
than
eight
days
had
elapsed
since
the
one
on
which
shotaye
had
pledged
her
new
friend
the
tehua
warrior
to
meet
him
at
the
homes
of
his
tribe
she
had
not
redeemed
that
pledge
in
appearance
she
was
unfaithful
to
cayamo
as
her
knight
was
called
and
yet
her
lack
of
compliance
with
her
promise
was
not
intentional
she
calculated
that
her
case
would
have
come
up
by
that
time
and
until
this
occurred
the
energetic
woman
had
no
intention
of
leaving
the
rito
much
less
of
forsaking
her
friend
say
koitza
now
that
her
case
had
been
delayed
the
eight
days
had
grown
to
nearly
ten
the
chayani
and
the
caciques
were
fasting
still
as
well
as
some
of
the
clan
delegates
twelve
days
had
passed
and
it
was
the
last
day
of
official
penance
that
evening
something
was
sure
to
occur
to
relieve
the
situation
so
everybody
thought
at
the
tyuonyi
so
shotaye
thought
herself
but
she
felt
more
than
usually
excited
and
worn
out
it
was
not
fear
it
was
the
natural
longing
of
a
soul
replete
with
energy
and
activity
to
see
a
matter
ended
that
kept
her
in
suspense
in
regard
to
say
koitza
she
felt
perfectly
reassured
the
woman
had
not
shown
herself
at
her
cave
and
must
feel
quiet
cautious
and
careful
when
the
sun
rose
on
the
fourth
day
it
found
shotaye
just
about
to
take
her
morning
meal
that
was
soon
over
for
there
was
no
coffee
no
hot
rolls
no
butter
it
consisted
merely
of
cold
when
she
had
satisfied
her
appetite
she
rose
shook
the
crumbs
from
her
wrap
and
went
out
she
had
made
a
full
toilet
that
is
she
had
rubbed
her
face
with
her
moistened
hands
and
dried
it
with
a
deerskin
whereby
a
little
more
dust
was
added
to
her
cheeks
she
felt
clean
it
was
yet
so
early
that
hardly
any
one
showed
himself
out
of
doors
the
sun
peeped
up
behind
the
volcanic
heights
in
the
east
casting
a
glow
over
the
summits
and
crests
that
rise
above
the
rio
grande
in
that
direction
the
tetilla
stood
out
boldly
crowning
the
black
ridges
with
its
slender
graceful
cone
shotaye
strolled
down
the
rito
a
few
people
were
about
but
regardless
of
these
and
what
they
might
think
or
say
she
wandered
along
past
the
dwellings
of
the
eagle
clan
what
if
tyope
should
see
her
let
him
see
me
she
thought
let
him
become
convinced
that
i
know
nothing
that
i
rest
easy
without
any
suspicion
whatever
of
the
dreadful
fate
he
has
prepared
for
me
later
on
he
may
find
out
that
his
former
wife
is
more
than
a
match
for
him
she
went
on
and
on
and
passed
the
big
house
a
few
men
stood
on
the
roofs
gazing
motionless
in
the
direction
where
the
sun
rose
like
a
mass
of
melted
ore
farther
she
went
always
down
stream
quietly
and
with
the
greatest
apparent
unconcern
a
girl
from
yakka
hanutsh
greeted
her
in
a
friendly
voice
she
returned
the
greeting
cheerfully
the
cliffs
wherein
oshatsh
shutzuna
and
lastly
shyuamo
resided
were
to
her
left
as
she
passed
the
grove
where
okoya
and
shyuote
had
had
their
first
discussion
here
she
turned
to
the
north
in
the
direction
of
the
spot
where
she
had
met
the
tehua
indian
even
on
this
upward
trail
rocky
as
it
was
and
overgrown
with
shrubbery
her
form
was
plainly
distinguishable
from
below
but
shotaye
scorned
to
conceal
herself
she
walked
without
haste
or
hurry
her
errand
was
perfectly
legitimate
and
everybody
might
see
her
undertake
it
everybody
might
indeed
witness
her
doings
as
far
as
these
could
be
seen
she
simply
took
a
walk
on
the
mesa
of
the
bird
ziro
kauash
she
hoped
also
to
gather
some
useful
plants
such
as
the
shkoa
a
vegetable
asclepias
apotz
a
of
the
genus
and
many
other
medicinal
herbs
known
to
the
indian
and
used
by
him
for
it
had
sprinkled
if
not
rained
every
day
of
late
and
last
night
rain
was
still
visible
in
the
drops
that
covered
the
leaves
the
ground
was
soft
and
her
step
left
plainly
distinguishable
tracks
not
only
might
every
one
see
her
she
almost
invited
people
to
follow
her
on
her
wanderings
tyope
the
koshare
naua
the
chayani
might
trail
and
spy
out
her
movements
as
much
and
as
long
as
they
pleased
step
by
step
if
they
wished
for
the
real
object
of
her
stroll
they
would
never
be
able
to
guess
after
reaching
the
top
of
the
plateau
shotaye
sat
down
on
a
protruding
rock
from
which
she
might
look
over
the
whole
valley
beneath
she
cared
little
for
this
her
main
object
was
to
rest
and
to
think
what
she
now
undertook
was
a
step
preliminary
to
the
last
act
a
trail
almost
indistinguishable
so
little
was
it
used
of
late
led
from
the
rito
to
the
north
where
the
tehuas
dwelt
in
caves
in
the
rock
which
they
name
puye
this
trail
was
the
object
of
shotaye
search
we
know
of
her
intention
to
take
refuge
among
the
northern
tribe
of
village
indians
but
she
had
meanwhile
determined
upon
something
else
she
not
only
wanted
to
go
but
had
determined
upon
returning
yes
she
would
return
though
not
alone
with
armed
men
from
the
puye
she
intended
to
return
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
she
would
hide
her
companions
at
the
approaches
to
the
tyuonyi
and
lie
in
wait
for
tyope
and
the
old
delight
maker
for
the
chayani
also
if
possible
the
tehuas
would
reap
many
scalps
she
would
have
had
her
revenge
and
the
deed
could
be
so
performed
as
to
make
those
at
the
rito
believe
that
the
navajos
were
the
perpetrators
this
was
her
plan
and
she
did
not
feel
the
slightest
scruple
or
compunction
for
years
she
had
been
among
her
own
people
the
butt
of
numberless
insults
and
mortifications
now
it
had
gone
so
far
that
her
life
even
was
in
imminent
peril
ere
this
should
be
lost
she
would
prove
to
her
enemies
that
she
was
alive
and
terribly
alive
to
reconnoitre
the
ground
to
study
every
detail
of
it
to
store
her
memory
with
everything
that
might
be
useful
or
valuable
in
the
lay
of
the
land
was
what
she
had
come
for
now
after
she
felt
thoroughly
rested
she
rose
and
continued
her
walk
where
she
had
been
sitting
the
trail
was
plain
for
there
it
descended
into
the
gorge
so
she
only
noticed
the
place
and
then
went
into
the
shrubbery
to
seek
for
plants
she
gathered
a
few
leaves
of
the
shiutui
sauntered
from
to
glanced
from
time
to
time
upward
into
the
tops
of
pines
to
see
whether
they
bore
edible
nuts
of
the
kind
now
called
piñons
or
threw
stones
at
the
noisy
birds
that
fluttered
about
again
she
came
upon
the
trail
and
her
trained
eye
could
follow
it
for
some
distance
until
it
disappeared
in
the
timber
so
far
she
felt
sure
of
her
impressions
for
the
future
and
turned
away
to
the
right
penetrating
deeper
into
the
forest
she
could
find
her
way
even
at
night
for
the
moon
shone
still
besides
once
acquainted
with
the
spot
whence
she
had
to
start
it
mattered
little
whether
there
was
any
path
or
not
the
indian
needs
only
two
points
to
guide
himself
the
place
of
departure
and
the
spot
where
he
wants
to
arrive
moreover
for
her
flight
it
was
better
not
to
follow
the
trail
at
all
she
felt
sure
of
meeting
some
one
of
the
tehuas
in
the
vicinity
of
the
puye
the
topographical
details
attracted
the
woman
attention
much
more
than
the
path
she
studied
them
carefully
pretending
to
hunt
for
plants
unconsciously
she
went
farther
and
farther
regardless
of
time
for
it
was
yet
early
the
surface
of
the
ziro
kauash
is
slightly
undulated
as
well
as
the
mesa
to
the
south
of
the
tyuonyi
the
timber
is
relatively
sparse
the
pines
are
grouped
together
at
intervals
and
juniper
and
cedar
bushes
cover
it
uniformly
like
an
extensive
irregular
plantation
such
is
the
topography
of
the
mesas
west
of
the
rio
grande
from
the
rito
until
one
is
beyond
and
opposite
to
san
ildefonso
they
are
traversed
and
cut
by
deep
ravines
and
cañons
which
run
generally
from
west
to
east
emptying
their
waters
after
storms
into
the
valley
of
the
river
through
narrow
gaps
or
terminating
before
reaching
the
stream
against
a
towering
wall
of
volcanic
rock
ere
shotaye
noticed
it
the
shrubbery
had
begun
to
grow
thinner
until
she
noticed
in
front
something
like
a
vacant
space
indicating
a
gap
beyond
that
gap
there
was
timber
again
this
told
her
that
she
had
reached
the
brink
of
the
first
cañon
north
of
the
rito
in
these
solitudes
game
is
not
by
any
means
so
plentiful
as
might
be
supposed
this
is
particularly
the
case
in
the
vicinity
of
indian
settlements
the
merciless
methods
of
communal
hunting
either
exterminate
or
frighten
away
most
of
the
larger
animals
roaming
tribes
send
parties
of
men
hunters
or
warriors
long
distances
away
and
these
not
only
slaughter
but
frighten
the
deer
the
mountain
sheep
and
the
mountain
goat
driving
them
into
regions
less
accessible
to
man
the
turkey
alone
that
noble
bird
with
its
dark
iridescent
plumage
remains
everywhere
and
shotaye
had
already
heard
their
loud
cackling
and
calling
before
she
entered
the
high
timber
several
gobblers
as
well
as
hens
had
run
away
on
her
approach
at
last
they
rose
into
the
air
one
after
the
other
flapping
their
wings
until
they
settled
down
on
a
tall
piñon
that
was
visible
from
where
the
woman
stood
there
were
four
birds
on
the
tree
with
necks
extended
and
eyelids
alternately
opening
and
shutting
they
peered
down
on
her
ready
to
soar
away
at
the
least
suspicious
motion
shotaye
could
not
resist
glancing
at
them
it
seemed
as
if
something
was
creeping
up
the
tree
very
slowly
like
a
grayish
streak
a
long
body
flattened
itself
against
the
trunk
shotaye
grew
attentive
and
the
more
so
as
the
suspicious
object
all
at
once
disappeared
below
the
nethermost
branches
the
turkeys
themselves
were
so
occupied
with
the
appearance
of
the
woman
that
they
lost
thought
of
everything
else
one
of
them
a
gobbler
braced
himself
up
his
breast
bulged
out
his
head
and
neck
drawn
in
then
quickly
thrusting
them
forward
sent
out
a
loud
cackle
at
this
moment
the
were
violently
tossed
about
with
noisy
flapping
of
their
wings
the
hens
rose
into
the
air
their
companion
flapped
his
wings
but
once
or
twice
and
disappeared
in
the
for
a
moment
the
twigs
and
branches
rustled
and
rattled
then
all
was
still
a
panther
had
surprised
them
and
secured
one
for
his
breakfast
a
long
distance
off
might
be
heard
the
cackling
of
another
gobbler
the
forest
was
full
of
turkeys
shotaye
burst
out
laughing
the
panther
had
done
well
he
had
enough
to
satisfy
his
appetite
besides
and
there
was
no
danger
of
her
being
attacked
the
american
panther
is
not
dangerous
to
man
but
he
carries
a
mouthful
of
very
sharp
teeth
and
his
claws
are
long
he
is
a
powerful
animal
agile
and
large
nobody
can
foretell
what
might
happen
in
case
he
should
be
the
woman
began
to
scan
the
landscape
around
it
was
a
clear
space
and
she
could
see
the
bushes
from
their
tops
down
to
the
ground
the
base
of
one
of
these
bushes
attracted
her
attention
almost
level
with
the
soil
something
black
appeared
beneath
its
branches
as
she
examined
it
more
closely
she
saw
that
it
was
not
really
black
but
of
a
grayish
brown
like
the
colour
of
the
soil
it
was
neither
a
plant
nor
was
it
a
part
of
the
earth
itself
nor
a
stone
it
might
be
some
animal
the
more
she
looked
the
more
she
became
satisfied
that
it
was
neither
animal
skin
nor
fur
the
object
was
hairless
only
the
skin
of
a
human
being
could
appear
so
smooth
her
first
impulse
was
to
hide
but
before
she
could
execute
her
purpose
the
object
moved
slightly
and
something
white
appeared
above
the
black
it
was
and
on
it
there
was
some
object
of
a
red
colour
the
eyes
of
shotaye
sparkled
she
abandoned
all
thoughts
of
concealment
or
of
flight
and
fastened
her
gaze
on
the
strange
thing
beneath
the
shrub
it
became
clearer
and
clearer
to
her
that
it
was
a
human
form
and
that
on
its
back
was
a
white
shield
decorated
with
red
that
shield
she
knew
to
be
cayamo
but
what
could
cayamo
be
doing
here
or
was
it
perhaps
not
he
but
some
navajo
who
had
vanquished
the
proud
warrior
and
was
carrying
home
his
weapons
in
triumph
the
latter
appeared
rather
improbable
and
yet
who
could
tell
at
all
events
the
man
was
alive
for
he
had
moved
it
was
equally
certain
that
he
had
not
seen
her
in
order
to
clear
up
all
doubt
shotaye
looked
around
for
shelter
and
saw
near
by
a
bush
that
afforded
a
scanty
she
glided
to
it
noiselessly
and
changing
her
position
got
nearer
to
him
and
was
even
able
to
see
more
of
his
body
and
dress
the
first
glance
satisfied
her
that
he
was
not
a
navajo
but
a
village
indian
and
indeed
her
friend
cayamo
every
trace
of
fear
disappeared
shotaye
left
the
shelter
of
the
bush
and
stepped
up
toward
him
rather
noisily
at
the
same
time
calling
his
name
he
did
not
reply
and
as
she
came
nearer
the
regular
breathing
and
the
heaving
of
his
chest
showed
the
cause
of
his
silence
the
great
warrior
from
the
puye
was
fast
asleep
under
different
circumstances
she
would
have
left
him
and
quietly
retired
but
now
she
could
not
the
opportunity
was
too
favourable
matters
too
threatening
for
her
she
must
be
recognized
by
him
once
more
must
show
to
him
that
she
still
counted
on
his
pledge
on
his
friendship
his
protection
yet
she
did
not
wake
him
but
went
close
to
his
prostrate
form
and
bent
over
it
even
holding
her
breath
for
a
while
he
slept
profoundly
the
on
his
face
was
sorely
blurred
the
campaign
had
not
improved
his
appearance
the
face
with
closed
eyes
resembled
a
lump
of
dirt
rather
than
a
human
head
his
kilt
was
tattered
and
his
legs
covered
with
scars
and
scratches
the
circular
sandals
much
dilapidated
were
tied
to
the
belt
and
close
to
them
was
another
object
which
shotaye
began
to
examine
attentively
while
her
eyes
flashed
at
the
sight
of
it
it
was
a
piece
of
human
skin
covered
with
gore
and
straight
hair
partly
plaited
her
heart
began
to
pulsate
proudly
and
in
delight
for
she
saw
that
cayamo
had
secured
a
scalp
the
scalp
of
a
navajo
cayamo
was
a
great
warrior
shotaye
was
careful
not
to
touch
the
trophy
for
no
woman
is
allowed
to
handle
the
sacred
token
until
after
its
taking
has
been
duly
celebrated
in
the
great
dance
of
the
tribe
but
lest
the
hero
might
wake
up
prematurely
and
notice
her
presence
in
too
close
proximity
to
the
repulsive
laurels
which
he
had
won
shotaye
quietly
withdrew
and
sat
down
at
some
distance
from
him
where
he
could
easily
see
her
and
quietly
awaited
his
rising
from
the
slumbers
of
fatigue
in
point
of
fact
it
was
not
proper
for
her
to
remain
so
close
to
him
the
warrior
must
keep
aloof
from
the
other
sex
until
he
has
been
purified
and
has
danced
shotaye
relied
upon
the
extraordinary
circumstances
and
upon
his
interpretation
of
her
presence
as
having
run
after
him
to
obtain
his
forgiveness
furthermore
they
were
alone
and
a
few
moments
spent
in
the
practice
of
could
not
she
trusted
deprive
the
scalp
of
the
magic
qualities
attributed
to
it
had
it
been
a
warrior
from
the
rito
she
would
have
left
him
long
ago
cayamo
was
manifestly
tired
for
he
slept
hard
the
sun
stood
close
to
the
zenith
and
still
he
dozed
the
luminary
of
day
did
not
only
illuminate
but
its
heat
was
scorching
the
shadows
under
cover
of
which
cayamo
had
retreated
were
moving
gradually
and
the
unkempt
head
of
the
hero
became
exposed
to
the
most
direct
rays
the
heat
began
to
disturb
him
he
groaned
stretched
himself
moved
uneasily
and
attempted
to
turn
over
in
this
he
bent
his
shield
and
the
hard
leather
struck
him
in
the
ribs
cayamo
woke
up
he
opened
his
eyes
and
yawned
closed
them
again
then
opened
the
lids
a
second
time
when
his
look
became
suddenly
a
stare
of
surprise
he
rose
to
a
sitting
posture
and
grasped
the
bow
as
well
as
his
in
this
position
he
stared
at
the
woman
who
smiled
winking
and
placing
a
finger
on
her
lips
as
soon
as
she
whispered
shotaye
the
threatening
flash
in
his
eye
vanished
he
dropped
both
weapons
and
threw
his
features
into
a
repulsive
hideous
grin
intended
for
a
soft
smile
then
he
rose
it
was
very
plain
that
he
felt
overjoyed
and
that
he
would
fain
have
expressed
his
delight
to
the
woman
through
some
clumsy
caress
but
he
restrained
his
feelings
and
became
serious
extending
his
arm
to
the
west
he
shook
his
head
in
a
warning
manner
pointed
to
himself
made
the
sign
indicating
the
act
of
men
coming
and
said
uan
save
then
he
waved
his
hand
northward
afterward
at
the
sun
and
finally
he
pointed
at
shotaye
uttering
uiye
tha
days
she
could
not
fully
comprehend
until
better
informed
she
drew
the
conclusion
that
the
navajos
were
in
pursuit
of
him
but
more
she
failed
to
understand
to
ascertain
his
meaning
she
pointed
at
him
then
at
herself
raised
four
of
her
fingers
and
asked
tehua
cayamo
shook
his
head
counted
two
on
his
fingers
accompanying
the
gestures
with
the
words
tema
quio
puye
pointing
to
the
north
at
the
same
time
now
her
doubts
were
cleared
shotaye
saw
that
two
days
hence
she
would
be
expected
among
the
tehuas
she
nodded
eagerly
and
rose
if
the
navajos
as
she
rightly
concluded
were
on
her
warrior
trail
it
was
unsafe
for
both
of
them
to
remain
here
long
but
neither
could
she
insinuate
to
cayamo
that
she
would
like
to
go
with
him
at
once
to
her
surprise
the
man
bent
down
and
with
his
fingers
drew
a
line
on
the
ground
which
ran
in
the
direction
where
the
of
the
tehuas
were
situated
the
woman
bent
over
him
with
great
curiosity
tupoge
said
cayamo
indicating
the
southern
end
of
the
line
and
looking
askance
shotaye
nodded
that
she
understood
and
he
slowly
moved
his
fingers
along
the
line
to
the
north
uttering
tema
quio
the
northern
terminus
of
the
streak
he
designated
as
puye
finally
he
made
a
mark
across
the
middle
of
the
line
saying
very
positively
uiye
tha
shotaye
teanyi
these
words
he
accompanied
successively
with
the
signs
for
the
number
two
for
male
indian
and
for
the
meeting
of
two
persons
nothing
could
be
clearer
two
days
hence
shotaye
was
to
leave
the
rito
for
the
puye
and
as
cayamo
himself
would
be
unable
to
meet
her
owing
to
the
ceremonies
which
he
had
to
perform
in
honour
of
the
scalp
some
male
friend
of
his
called
teayni
would
meet
her
and
conduct
her
safely
to
the
abode
of
his
people
with
a
radiant
face
the
woman
nodded
assent
and
made
other
gestures
expressive
of
delight
and
agreement
cayamo
took
advantage
of
his
cowering
posture
to
fasten
the
to
his
naked
feet
and
then
rose
and
took
the
trail
towards
the
north
but
shotaye
held
him
back
in
token
of
misgivings
he
understood
her
motive
but
pointed
to
his
circular
and
smiled
it
was
clear
that
he
trusted
to
the
round
tracks
left
by
that
contrivance
for
safety
so
he
went
on
toward
the
brink
of
the
gorge
that
lay
before
them
as
soon
as
his
form
had
sunk
below
it
shotaye
also
turned
this
time
in
the
direction
of
the
rito
everything
was
right
at
last
she
felt
safe
completely
safe
for
the
road
was
clear
to
her
and
furthermore
cayamo
of
whose
attachment
she
was
now
fully
convinced
would
provide
for
a
guide
during
the
second
half
of
the
journey
which
was
utterly
unknown
to
her
everything
was
moving
to
her
fullest
satisfaction
provided
she
could
escape
from
the
rito
in
regard
to
that
matter
she
had
scarcely
any
doubt
unless
and
this
thought
came
to
her
while
she
was
wending
her
way
slowly
homeward
some
one
should
have
followed
her
and
witnessed
the
strange
meeting
between
her
and
cayamo
in
that
case
everything
might
be
lost
but
there
were
not
the
slightest
marks
of
human
presence
about
nature
even
seemed
to
slumber
in
the
heat
of
the
day
an
occasional
lizard
rustled
through
the
dried
twigs
and
fallen
pine
needles
a
crow
sat
on
a
dry
limb
and
high
up
in
the
air
an
eagle
soared
below
the
mares
tails
that
streamed
over
the
sky
it
would
have
been
very
disagreeable
to
say
the
least
if
one
or
other
of
the
navajos
who
were
in
pursuit
of
cayamo
should
cross
her
path
but
of
this
she
had
little
fear
she
was
already
too
near
the
rito
for
that
soon
the
gorge
opened
at
her
feet
showing
a
placid
lovely
picture
the
little
valley
down
below
huge
pines
raising
their
dark
columns
by
the
side
of
and
the
tall
pile
of
the
big
houses
looming
up
like
an
enormous
round
tower
but
shotaye
was
not
affected
by
scenery
walking
along
the
brink
to
the
west
she
at
last
reached
the
upper
end
where
twelve
days
ago
she
had
ascended
and
where
the
brook
swollen
by
late
rains
now
gushed
down
the
ledges
in
a
series
of
murmuring
cascades
here
she
began
her
descent
and
as
the
sun
disappeared
behind
threatening
clouds
over
the
western
mountains
she
entered
her
home
again
shotaye
had
spent
nearly
the
whole
day
on
the
mesa
had
spent
it
profitably
and
was
so
she
fancied
in
complete
security
as
regarded
her
ultimate
designs
and
yet
had
the
woman
after
taking
leave
of
the
strange
indian
and
after
the
latter
had
gone
out
of
sight
peered
into
the
shadow
of
the
pines
on
one
of
which
the
panther
had
so
nimbly
captured
the
unsuspecting
turkey
she
might
have
noticed
something
that
would
have
greatly
modified
her
ideas
on
this
point
for
behind
one
of
them
there
stood
all
the
while
she
and
the
tehua
were
carrying
on
their
pantomime
a
human
figure
intently
watching
them
pressed
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
there
was
motionless
quiet
calm
not
a
common
spy
but
a
cool
observer
of
her
doings
whose
presence
was
accidental
but
who
not
only
watched
but
at
the
same
time
judged
and
passed
sentence
on
her
actions
a
short
time
after
shotaye
had
set
out
on
her
walk
topanashka
tihua
also
started
in
the
same
direction
with
all
the
he
had
maintained
inward
agitation
and
sorrow
nearly
overcame
him
the
nearer
the
hour
came
when
the
momentous
question
that
was
going
to
shake
the
existence
of
the
tribe
to
its
very
foundations
would
be
taken
in
hand
the
more
conscious
he
became
that
he
was
carrying
a
terrible
load
and
that
upon
his
action
depended
nearly
everything
the
feeling
of
responsibility
was
crushing
he
had
of
course
ascertained
nothing
new
neither
had
he
thought
of
making
notes
of
what
met
his
gaze
but
on
this
last
day
he
felt
the
necessity
of
being
alone
ere
the
dread
moment
came
others
could
not
help
he
was
alone
with
his
thoughts
and
yet
as
he
did
no
fasting
not
alone
in
the
proper
use
of
the
word
on
that
last
day
therefore
he
resolved
upon
retiring
to
some
solitude
it
would
attract
no
undue
attention
and
he
would
have
done
according
to
the
spirit
of
the
shaman
instructions
after
leaving
the
rito
he
climbed
to
the
northern
mesa
and
instead
of
resting
on
its
brink
as
shotaye
had
he
strolled
into
the
timber
perfectly
at
random
hardly
conscious
whither
he
directed
his
steps
and
content
to
be
for
once
alone
with
his
dismal
thoughts
however
much
he
speculated
and
reflected
upon
the
matter
he
drew
not
the
slightest
comfort
from
it
the
main
factor
he
lacked
namely
a
knowledge
of
the
judgment
which
those
above
would
render
this
the
chayani
alone
knew
and
they
alone
would
proclaim
it
at
the
council
if
the
case
of
shotaye
only
had
been
before
the
meeting
his
position
would
have
been
very
simple
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
kill
her
if
found
guilty
and
he
was
ready
to
do
this
at
any
time
he
did
not
especially
hate
the
woman
and
all
he
cared
for
in
such
an
event
was
to
perform
his
duty
in
regard
to
his
daughter
say
he
no
longer
entertained
any
apprehension
matters
however
had
degenerated
into
a
venomous
contention
between
two
clans
amounting
almost
to
a
schism
in
the
tribe
if
now
the
chayani
in
the
name
of
the
shiuana
proclaimed
that
shyuamo
was
right
and
the
others
his
own
clan
included
resisted
what
then
he
had
to
obey
he
had
to
execute
what
those
above
decreed
for
that
purpose
was
he
called
maseua
like
him
who
bears
the
same
name
and
is
the
most
active
among
all
the
deities
on
high
what
the
shiuana
determined
was
right
always
the
old
man
sat
down
under
a
tree
and
attempted
to
ponder
over
this
little
query
of
always
but
he
did
it
in
vain
it
was
a
problem
perhaps
not
beyond
the
reach
of
his
intelligence
if
it
had
been
properly
cultivated
but
far
beyond
the
limits
which
training
and
custom
had
set
to
the
working
powers
of
that
intelligence
he
staggered
from
doubt
to
doubt
and
finally
gave
it
up
no
other
conclusion
could
he
reach
than
to
wait
but
waiting
alone
gives
no
light
does
not
comfort
gives
neither
strength
nor
wisdom
strength
and
wisdom
so
the
indian
believes
are
gifts
from
above
and
can
be
obtained
by
prayer
topanashka
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
would
pray
he
picked
up
a
stone
and
was
searching
his
memory
for
one
of
the
many
formulas
that
the
indian
has
in
his
rituals
when
a
faint
pattering
sound
attracted
his
attention
illustration
looking
out
from
one
of
the
weathered
of
the
it
was
as
if
something
glided
through
brushwood
he
forgot
to
pray
and
listened
now
it
sounded
again
at
a
greater
distance
from
him
only
some
animal
could
have
produced
the
noise
a
human
being
would
either
have
come
up
to
him
if
a
friend
or
kept
absolutely
still
if
a
foe
he
looked
and
looked
and
at
last
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
yellowish
fur
gliding
along
the
ground
when
a
cat
glides
stealthily
she
is
on
the
hunt
his
curiosity
was
fully
aroused
he
longed
to
see
what
the
animal
was
hunting
and
how
he
would
succeed
furthermore
the
panther
is
in
the
eyes
of
the
pueblo
indian
the
symbol
of
the
greatest
physical
power
a
feeling
overcame
the
old
man
as
if
this
symbol
was
presenting
itself
to
him
at
the
very
time
when
he
needed
the
greatest
moral
strength
himself
and
the
animal
appeared
like
a
living
fetich
a
hint
from
those
above
he
followed
the
movements
of
the
puma
eagerly
the
tree
where
the
turkeys
sat
stood
near
he
had
heard
their
gobblings
long
ago
without
paying
any
attention
to
them
but
now
they
explained
the
movements
of
the
gigantic
cat
he
was
creeping
up
to
the
birds
the
puma
approached
the
tree
noiselessly
at
its
foot
he
laid
down
his
head
and
raised
his
tail
sweeping
the
ground
with
nervous
force
now
the
beast
of
prey
began
to
climb
the
trunk
of
the
pine
carefully
and
noiselessly
he
reached
the
lower
branches
and
disappeared
within
their
maze
then
followed
his
spring
and
the
turkeys
flew
away
all
but
one
with
a
tremendous
leap
the
cat
broke
through
the
and
down
on
the
ground
with
the
wriggling
bird
in
his
jaws
and
trotted
off
howling
topanashka
had
witnessed
the
performance
with
interest
and
with
genuine
pleasure
he
admired
the
strength
and
the
swiftness
of
the
animal
hunter
unconsciously
his
thought
turned
back
to
the
intended
prayer
and
he
earnestly
addressed
it
now
to
those
above
that
they
might
give
to
his
heart
the
strength
which
the
panther
had
shown
in
his
limbs
placing
two
sticks
on
the
ground
before
him
and
a
stone
over
them
he
rose
to
go
but
another
sight
met
his
eyes
and
he
stood
still
as
if
rooted
to
the
soil
gazed
and
gazed
his
eyes
opened
wide
then
his
expression
became
dark
and
almost
fierce
on
the
clear
space
beyond
the
pines
on
which
the
puma
had
caught
his
prey
a
woman
sat
near
a
and
in
the
shade
of
the
bush
a
man
rested
the
first
glance
convinced
topanashka
that
the
man
wore
paint
and
carried
the
accoutrements
and
weapons
of
a
warrior
it
was
not
a
warrior
from
the
rito
he
was
positive
it
could
not
be
nor
was
it
a
navajo
he
undoubtedly
belonged
to
some
foreign
tribe
of
village
indians
in
all
probability
to
the
tehuas
what
was
he
here
for
and
what
business
had
the
woman
in
his
company
indians
in
do
not
associate
with
women
topanashka
strained
his
eyes
and
recognized
to
his
astonishment
and
dismay
the
woman
shotaye
he
could
not
contain
himself
any
longer
like
a
shadow
he
moved
forward
and
hid
behind
the
trunk
of
a
pine
whence
he
could
see
more
and
better
from
there
he
witnessed
the
strange
pantomime
of
shotaye
and
cayamo
he
was
too
far
off
to
hear
the
words
but
the
gestures
spoke
plainly
enough
as
they
pointed
and
gesticulated
to
the
west
north
and
south
he
thought
that
they
were
planning
some
murderous
surprise
for
the
queres
that
shotaye
was
betraying
her
own
people
and
conspiring
with
an
enemy
of
her
own
stock
fierce
wrath
filled
his
heart
yes
charge
was
true
the
woman
was
a
witch
and
had
topanashka
been
armed
he
would
have
sought
to
kill
her
on
the
spot
but
though
he
had
no
weapons
his
hand
clutched
a
stone
raised
it
from
the
ground
and
held
it
in
readiness
the
interview
ended
the
tehua
disappeared
and
shotaye
went
in
the
direction
of
the
rito
topanashka
felt
tempted
to
follow
her
at
once
to
overtake
her
if
possible
and
secure
her
person
or
even
to
execute
summary
justice
but
she
was
sure
not
to
escape
him
she
had
evidently
not
noticed
his
presence
and
had
gone
back
to
her
den
in
the
cliffs
in
complete
security
there
on
this
very
evening
he
would
seize
her
drag
her
before
the
uuityam
disclose
her
shameless
and
dangerous
plots
and
doom
her
to
the
horrible
death
she
deserved
to
suffer
whither
was
her
accomplice
the
tehua
going
meanwhile
he
was
probably
returning
to
his
people
to
report
and
to
lead
back
those
in
whose
company
he
intended
to
carry
out
the
projected
assault
the
old
man
could
not
stop
him
being
himself
unarmed
but
he
could
follow
at
a
distance
cautiously
and
without
exposing
himself
to
danger
for
it
was
possible
that
the
hellish
plot
had
developed
much
further
and
that
the
warriors
from
the
north
were
lurking
already
near
by
to
pounce
upon
the
queres
at
daybreak
it
was
not
only
from
the
instinct
of
the
old
warrior
scout
it
was
out
of
a
sense
of
duty
as
head
that
he
determined
at
once
upon
following
the
tehua
as
soon
as
shotaye
too
was
out
of
sight
he
went
over
to
the
spot
where
the
interview
had
taken
place
and
examined
the
soil
carefully
the
round
impression
made
by
a
struck
his
eye
it
proved
to
him
beyond
any
possibility
of
doubt
that
his
inferences
were
correct
the
old
man
straightened
himself
to
his
full
height
his
piercing
glance
went
in
the
direction
whither
the
tehua
had
gone
he
bent
forward
again
and
followed
the
same
line
toward
the
north
the
sun
had
just
set
over
the
rito
it
disappeared
behind
dense
clouds
a
storm
was
gathering
in
the
west
its
wings
were
spreading
like
tentacles
they
pushed
on
to
meet
the
moon
whose
light
was
just
rising
in
the
east
as
a
dim
whitish
arch
the
orb
itself
still
remained
below
the
horizon
gusts
of
wind
whirled
up
the
gorge
from
the
east
at
intervals
causing
the
pines
to
sigh
the
willows
and
poplars
to
rustle
the
corn
whispered
and
tinkled
the
usual
bustle
prevailed
about
the
houses
and
in
front
of
the
caves
before
the
grotto
where
the
council
was
to
meet
that
night
men
were
standing
sitting
or
lounging
they
were
the
delegates
who
had
come
to
listen
at
last
to
the
oracle
which
was
to
be
revealed
to
them
through
the
mouth
of
the
great
shaman
their
number
was
not
yet
complete
the
tapop
tyope
the
koshare
naua
were
there
but
neither
the
caciques
nor
the
chayani
nor
the
maseua
had
put
in
an
appearance
everybody
was
silent
hardly
a
word
was
heard
from
time
to
time
seldom
a
whisper
the
men
were
in
part
exhausted
by
long
penitence
but
mostly
depressed
as
if
some
nightmare
was
still
weighing
upon
them
the
obligation
to
be
silent
imposed
by
the
was
yet
in
force
one
by
one
those
who
were
lacking
came
the
appeared
at
last
and
only
the
yaya
and
the
maseua
were
missing
the
tapop
prompted
by
a
wink
of
the
hishtanyi
chayan
went
into
the
cave
and
prepared
the
it
burned
well
but
nobody
came
distant
thunder
rolled
through
the
clouds
lightning
flashed
from
them
in
fiery
red
tongues
the
wind
continued
to
blow
in
gusts
but
at
long
intervals
only
between
gust
and
gust
it
grew
dismally
anxiously
still
the
singing
shouting
laughing
of
the
people
had
almost
ceased
now
the
wind
again
whirled
up
the
valley
stronger
than
before
and
as
its
noise
ceased
a
plaintive
sound
a
distant
howling
floated
on
the
air
it
waxed
in
strength
and
power
till
it
rose
into
the
night
shrill
and
the
men
listened
in
surprise
sobs
cries
shrieks
from
time
to
time
a
piercing
scream
were
the
dismal
sounds
that
struck
upon
their
ears
all
came
from
the
large
building
it
was
a
lament
by
many
voices
the
sad
lament
over
the
dead
breathlessly
they
listened
hurried
footsteps
rushed
toward
them
several
men
came
running
up
the
slope
when
the
foremost
of
them
reached
the
group
he
asked
panting
where
is
the
tapop
hoshkanyi
tihua
stepped
forward
and
inquired
what
has
happened
what
do
you
want
our
father
the
maseua
gasped
the
man
is
dead
he
was
killed
on
the
ziro
kauash
who
killed
him
demanded
the
principal
chayan
placing
himself
in
front
of
the
speaker
the
indian
raised
his
arm
on
high
from
it
depended
a
circular
object
as
the
pale
light
of
the
rising
moon
fell
on
it
it
was
plainly
distinguishable
as
a
circular
chapter
xv
did
you
find
that
asked
the
shaman
yes
i
found
it
i
and
hayash
tihua
together
where
on
the
kauash
on
the
trail
that
leads
to
the
north
who
killed
sa
nashtio
the
chayan
further
inquired
he
alone
carried
on
the
investigation
hoshkanyi
tihua
had
mingled
with
the
rest
again
and
stood
there
silent
and
speechless
over
the
terrible
news
neither
did
any
of
the
others
utter
a
single
word
but
from
time
to
time
one
or
the
other
shook
his
head
and
sighed
deeply
we
do
know
replied
the
indian
for
we
did
not
find
anything
else
have
you
looked
for
more
emphasized
the
the
other
hung
his
head
as
if
he
felt
the
reproach
no
he
said
in
a
low
tone
why
not
because
we
were
afraid
that
other
tehuas
might
be
around
how
do
you
know
that
the
people
from
the
north
have
killed
our
nashtio
because
the
moshome
dinne
never
wear
such
he
pointed
to
the
sandal
which
he
had
handed
to
the
tapop
did
the
shoe
lie
where
our
father
died
no
we
found
it
closer
to
the
tyuonyi
a
flutter
went
through
the
group
a
movement
of
surprise
and
of
terror
many
persons
had
collected
and
the
steps
of
more
were
heard
coming
up
in
the
valley
the
wind
sighed
louder
than
its
plaintive
moaning
sounded
the
howling
wail
that
continued
in
the
great
house
with
undiminished
power
the
hishtanyi
continued
how
did
the
shuatyam
kill
our
father
his
voice
trembled
as
he
uttered
these
words
with
arrows
have
you
brought
them
along
yes
how
many
one
where
is
the
corpse
at
the
house
of
tanyi
hanutsh
the
shaman
turned
around
tyame
he
called
to
the
delegate
of
the
eagle
clan
do
your
duty
and
you
too
tapop
the
group
was
about
to
disperse
when
the
shikama
chayan
called
back
the
men
who
had
brought
the
news
all
stood
still
and
listened
is
the
head
entire
asked
the
the
scalp
is
not
on
it
a
murmur
of
indignation
arose
the
chayan
turned
away
and
walked
slowly
along
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
toward
his
dwelling
every
one
set
out
for
the
great
house
talking
together
excitedly
but
in
low
voices
the
tapop
tyame
and
the
two
men
who
had
found
the
body
took
the
lead
the
hishtanyi
chayan
and
the
shkuy
chayan
came
last
the
nearer
they
came
to
the
great
building
the
louder
and
more
dismal
sounded
the
lamentations
the
storm
was
approaching
with
threatening
speed
one
dense
mass
of
inky
clouds
shrouded
the
west
from
time
to
time
it
seemed
to
open
and
sheets
of
fire
would
fill
the
gap
to
this
threatening
sky
the
ascended
tremulously
and
plaintively
like
a
timid
appeal
for
redress
in
response
the
heavens
shot
angry
lightning
and
thunderpeals
the
cliffs
on
the
tyuonyi
trembled
and
the
voices
from
above
which
seemed
to
tell
feeble
humanity
below
we
come
it
was
long
before
sunset
when
the
old
of
the
queres
after
having
thoroughly
examined
the
spot
where
the
interview
between
shotaye
and
the
tehua
indian
took
place
began
to
follow
on
the
tracks
of
the
latter
he
was
undertaking
a
difficult
an
extremely
dangerous
task
it
is
not
easy
for
a
man
well
provided
with
weapons
to
pursue
an
armed
indian
but
to
attempt
it
unarmed
is
foolhardiness
the
indian
is
most
dangerous
when
retreating
for
then
he
enjoys
the
best
opportunities
to
display
his
main
tactics
in
warfare
which
are
hiding
and
patient
lurking
he
has
every
opportunity
to
prepare
his
favourite
ambush
and
woe
unto
him
who
runs
after
an
indian
on
the
retreat
unless
the
pursuer
is
thoroughly
prepared
and
well
acquainted
with
the
of
the
redman
the
annals
of
western
warfare
give
sad
evidence
of
the
disastrous
results
the
mountaineers
among
the
indian
tribes
are
those
who
are
best
skilled
in
the
murderous
game
indians
of
the
plains
have
less
occasion
to
cultivate
it
topanashka
tihua
was
aware
that
if
he
followed
the
tehua
he
was
risking
his
own
life
but
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
attempted
such
dangerous
undertakings
and
so
far
he
had
never
failed
with
the
configuration
of
the
ground
and
the
landmarks
in
vegetation
and
scenery
he
was
far
better
acquainted
than
the
tehua
furthermore
he
enjoyed
the
material
advantage
that
the
latter
could
not
have
noticed
him
everything
depended
on
ascertaining
unseen
as
much
as
possible
about
the
enemy
movements
from
some
of
shotaye
gesticulations
the
maseua
had
concluded
that
the
tehua
would
proceed
on
the
old
trail
leading
from
the
rito
to
the
puye
or
at
least
keep
himself
very
near
that
trail
he
was
confirmed
in
it
by
the
direction
which
the
friend
of
the
woman
took
after
leaving
her
topanashka
maintained
therefore
the
same
course
going
slowly
and
with
the
greatest
caution
he
kept
on
the
alert
for
the
least
noise
that
struck
him
as
suspicious
or
for
which
he
could
not
at
once
account
in
consequence
of
the
heat
of
the
day
the
forest
was
remarkably
still
not
a
breeze
sighed
through
the
tops
of
the
pines
for
the
wind
that
blows
toward
a
coming
storm
and
heralds
its
approach
rises
later
in
the
day
the
distant
gobbling
of
turkeys
was
a
sound
that
awakened
no
suspicions
the
more
so
as
it
grew
fainter
and
fainter
receding
in
the
direction
of
the
higher
crests
and
peaks
neither
were
the
numerous
crows
a
source
of
uneasiness
to
him
on
every
clearing
these
birds
gravely
promenaded
by
together
and
his
cautious
gliding
across
such
exposed
places
did
not
in
the
least
discommode
the
dusky
company
as
soon
as
topanashka
came
in
sight
of
the
trail
again
he
kept
near
it
but
to
its
left
gliding
from
tree
to
tree
or
creeping
across
clear
expanses
from
shrub
to
shrub
he
therefore
moved
more
slowly
than
the
tehua
whom
he
was
pursuing
in
this
manner
he
had
advanced
for
quite
a
while
always
keeping
an
eye
on
the
trail
to
his
right
when
he
caught
sight
of
a
suspicious
object
lying
directly
in
the
path
where
the
latter
was
barely
more
than
a
faint
streak
across
the
thin
grass
that
grows
sometimes
on
the
plateaus
in
bunches
at
once
the
old
man
stopped
cowered
behind
a
juniper
and
waited
a
novice
on
the
or
an
inexperienced
white
man
would
have
gone
to
examine
the
strange
object
more
closely
but
the
old
scout
takes
such
unexpected
finds
in
the
light
of
serious
warning
nothing
appears
more
suspicious
to
him
than
something
which
seems
to
have
been
accidentally
dropped
on
a
trail
over
which
hostile
indians
are
retreating
he
forthwith
thinks
of
a
decoy
and
is
careful
not
to
approach
for
topanashka
it
was
doubly
significant
for
had
the
object
purposely
been
placed
there
it
led
to
the
disagreeable
inference
that
the
tehua
was
aware
of
his
pursuit
in
that
case
he
was
sure
to
lie
in
wait
for
him
and
upon
nearer
approach
he
could
expect
an
without
the
least
doubt
that
shot
might
miss
him
but
at
all
events
the
lurking
enemy
would
find
out
that
his
pursuer
was
an
unarmed
man
and
that
there
was
no
danger
in
attacking
him
openly
then
the
situation
would
become
desperate
still
as
the
old
man
had
always
kept
to
the
right
of
the
trail
it
was
possible
that
the
enemy
had
not
so
far
noticed
him
but
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
suspicious
object
that
enemy
must
be
hidden
of
that
he
felt
sure
it
was
a
very
serious
moment
for
any
awkward
movement
or
the
least
noise
might
bring
about
his
destruction
under
such
circumstances
many
a
one
sends
a
short
prayer
to
heaven
for
assistance
in
his
hour
of
need
not
so
the
indian
he
has
only
formulas
and
ritualistic
performances
and
there
was
no
time
to
remember
the
former
or
to
think
of
the
latter
topanashka
strained
his
eyes
to
the
utmost
to
find
out
the
nature
of
the
suspicious
object
that
lay
not
far
from
his
but
he
could
arrive
at
no
satisfactory
result
it
appeared
to
be
round
like
a
flat
disk
but
of
what
material
it
was
made
and
for
what
purpose
it
had
been
manufactured
he
could
not
discover
at
last
it
flashed
upon
him
that
it
might
be
one
of
the
circular
of
the
tehua
whose
tracks
he
had
noticed
from
time
to
time
which
the
owner
might
have
taken
off
and
deposited
here
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
enemy
must
be
close
at
hand
topanashka
had
no
thought
of
turning
back
flight
was
very
difficult
since
he
did
not
know
where
the
foe
lurked
to
wait
was
the
only
thing
to
be
done
wait
until
night
came
and
then
improve
the
darkness
to
return
to
the
rito
in
safety
but
what
of
the
at
which
he
was
compelled
to
assist
crouched
behind
the
cautiously
peering
out
from
behind
it
now
and
then
the
old
warrior
pondered
over
the
situation
at
last
he
saw
what
to
do
slowly
extending
his
feet
and
legs
backward
he
little
by
little
succeeded
in
laying
himself
flat
on
his
stomach
he
had
noticed
that
not
far
behind
him
there
was
another
and
much
taller
bush
toward
this
bush
he
crept
but
like
a
crawfish
feet
foremost
had
his
enemy
stood
otherwise
than
in
a
line
with
the
first
shelter
which
topanashka
had
made
use
of
he
would
surely
have
sent
an
arrow
during
this
retrograde
performance
he
continued
to
crawfish
until
the
tall
bush
was
between
him
and
the
smaller
one
once
covered
by
the
former
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
around
a
peculiar
stillness
reigned
not
a
breeze
stirred
the
sun
was
blazing
hot
notwithstanding
the
long
trailing
clouds
that
traversed
the
sky
kuawk
kuawk
kuawk
sounded
the
cries
of
several
crows
as
they
flew
from
a
neighbouring
tree
they
went
in
the
very
direction
where
topanashka
suspected
the
tehua
to
be
and
alighted
on
a
piñon
in
that
neighbourhood
the
old
man
glanced
not
at
the
birds
but
at
the
trunk
above
which
the
crows
were
sitting
it
was
not
thick
enough
to
conceal
the
body
of
a
man
and
about
it
the
ground
was
bare
if
there
had
been
anybody
hiding
there
the
cunning
and
mistrustful
birds
would
never
have
alighted
the
maseua
took
this
into
consideration
and
began
to
doubt
the
correctness
of
his
former
conclusions
yet
it
was
wiser
not
to
attempt
a
close
examination
of
the
sandal
such
curiosity
might
still
lead
to
fatal
results
like
an
old
fox
topanashka
determined
to
circumvent
the
dangerous
spot
by
describing
a
wide
arc
around
it
he
would
thus
meet
the
trail
farther
north
and
be
able
to
judge
from
signs
there
whether
or
not
the
tehua
was
close
upon
the
rito
first
he
would
have
to
crawl
backward
until
he
was
at
a
sufficient
distance
to
be
out
of
sight
altogether
this
movement
he
began
to
execute
in
his
usual
slow
and
deliberate
manner
crawfishing
until
he
felt
sure
that
he
could
not
be
seen
from
the
point
where
the
crows
had
taken
their
position
once
during
his
retreat
the
birds
fluttered
upward
croaking
but
alighted
again
on
the
same
spot
something
must
have
disturbed
them
topanashka
arose
straightened
himself
and
moved
ahead
as
noiselessly
as
possible
he
maintained
a
course
parallel
to
the
trail
the
old
man
considered
himself
now
as
being
in
the
country
of
the
enemy
and
on
hostile
ground
for
whereas
he
was
in
reality
not
far
from
the
rito
still
possibly
he
had
an
enemy
in
his
rear
it
is
the
custom
of
a
warrior
of
high
rank
in
the
esoteric
cluster
of
the
war
magicians
ere
the
trailing
of
an
enemy
begins
to
pronounce
a
short
prayer
and
topanashka
had
neglected
it
his
indignation
at
the
discovery
of
shotaye
misdeed
was
the
cause
of
this
neglect
now
it
came
to
his
mind
kuawk
kuawk
kuawk
a
crow
flew
overhead
it
came
from
the
tree
where
the
others
had
been
sitting
or
at
least
from
that
direction
to
the
indian
the
crow
is
a
bird
of
ill
omen
its
discordant
voice
is
next
to
the
cry
of
the
owl
regarded
as
the
most
dismal
forewarning
the
use
of
its
plumage
in
magic
is
strongly
condemned
was
it
not
strange
that
those
harbingers
of
misfortune
so
persistently
followed
him
and
that
their
repulsive
croaking
always
interrupted
his
thoughts
topanashka
resolved
to
make
good
on
the
spot
what
he
had
omitted
and
ere
he
moved
to
pray
in
place
of
the
formula
which
the
warrior
recites
when
he
is
on
the
track
of
an
enemy
topanashka
selected
another
one
spoken
upon
entering
dangerous
ground
where
enemies
may
be
lurking
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
latter
was
better
adapted
to
the
occasion
since
he
was
unarmed
and
therefore
unable
to
fight
in
case
of
necessity
he
still
carried
with
him
the
same
fetich
a
rude
alabaster
figure
of
the
panther
which
we
saw
dangling
from
his
necklace
on
the
day
he
went
to
visit
the
tapop
but
the
necklace
he
had
left
at
home
this
time
and
he
carried
the
amulet
in
a
leather
satchel
concealed
under
his
wrap
he
took
out
the
wallet
and
removed
the
fetich
from
it
to
the
back
of
the
figure
was
fastened
a
small
on
the
sides
a
turquoise
and
a
few
shells
were
tied
with
strings
of
yucca
fibre
the
old
man
squatted
on
the
ground
took
from
the
same
satchel
a
pinch
of
sacred
meal
and
scattered
it
to
the
six
regions
then
he
whispered
nashtio
shiuana
kopishtai
make
me
precious
this
day
even
if
the
land
be
full
of
enemies
let
not
my
life
be
threatened
by
them
protect
me
from
them
let
none
of
the
moshome
go
across
this
line
he
drew
a
line
in
the
sand
with
the
give
me
protection
from
them
mokatsh
tyame
shiuana
shield
my
heart
from
the
enemy
while
pronouncing
the
latter
words
he
drew
three
more
lines
breathed
on
the
fetich
placed
it
in
the
satchel
again
and
rose
he
felt
strengthened
for
he
had
performed
his
duty
toward
the
shiuana
had
satisfied
those
above
kuawk
kuawk
kuawk
the
crow
soared
back
over
his
head
the
ugly
bird
topanashka
eyelids
twitched
angrily
he
was
amazed
he
resumed
his
walk
or
rather
his
cautious
gliding
gait
his
head
bent
forward
all
his
faculties
strained
to
see
to
hear
and
to
detect
frequently
he
would
stop
hide
himself
and
listen
all
was
quiet
around
him
for
even
the
crows
kept
silent
or
were
heard
in
the
distance
only
the
glare
of
the
sunlight
was
less
vivid
the
afternoon
was
on
the
wane
the
late
hour
was
not
alone
the
cause
of
the
diminution
of
light
the
sun
was
shrouded
by
heavy
masses
of
clouds
with
the
waning
daylight
it
grew
cooler
a
faint
breeze
being
wafted
over
from
the
rio
grande
the
old
man
rightly
supposed
that
he
was
approaching
the
trail
again
and
would
soon
strike
it
the
cañon
near
which
he
had
surprised
shotaye
and
her
ally
lay
some
distance
in
his
rear
and
to
the
right
for
the
old
trail
crosses
it
at
its
upper
end
and
the
cañon
bends
to
the
north
topanashka
intended
to
reach
this
upper
terminus
he
expected
in
case
other
tehuas
should
be
about
that
they
would
be
hidden
in
that
vicinity
he
wanted
to
strike
the
path
first
and
survey
it
if
from
a
distance
only
then
keep
on
again
in
a
line
parallel
to
its
course
until
it
crossed
the
ravine
afterward
he
would
go
back
to
the
tyuonyi
if
possible
with
the
sandal
as
corroborative
evidence
he
almost
chided
himself
now
for
not
having
picked
up
the
the
more
he
reflected
the
more
he
became
convinced
that
his
suspicions
about
some
ambush
having
been
prepared
by
means
of
the
sandal
were
groundless
the
crows
especially
seemed
to
be
a
sure
sign
of
it
that
bird
is
very
bold
but
also
very
sly
and
had
a
warrior
or
any
human
being
been
in
concealment
would
never
have
selected
his
vicinity
for
a
place
of
comfortable
rest
had
they
not
flown
away
as
soon
as
he
approached
their
and
yet
he
moved
very
slowly
and
noiselessly
but
why
did
the
crows
so
persistently
follow
him
what
signified
their
restlessness
their
loud
and
repeated
cries
it
boded
nothing
good
the
black
pursuivants
either
foretold
or
intended
evil
were
they
real
crows
the
indian
is
so
imbued
with
the
notion
of
sorcery
that
any
animal
that
behaves
unusually
appears
to
him
either
as
a
human
being
changed
into
an
animal
or
some
spirit
which
has
assumed
the
form
for
a
purpose
that
purpose
is
either
good
or
bad
owls
crows
and
also
the
coyote
are
regarded
as
forms
assumed
by
evil
spirits
or
by
men
under
the
influence
of
evil
charms
the
more
topanashka
reflected
upon
the
conduct
of
the
birds
the
more
superstitious
he
became
concerning
them
they
certainly
meant
harm
either
they
sought
to
allure
him
into
danger
or
they
indicated
the
presence
of
imminent
peril
whatever
that
danger
might
be
and
wherever
it
might
lurk
the
man
thought
of
nothing
but
to
do
his
duty
under
all
circumstances
he
was
after
all
glad
that
he
had
not
taken
up
the
sandal
it
had
brought
him
as
far
as
he
was
now
and
he
considered
it
his
duty
to
go
to
the
bitter
end
and
find
out
everything
if
possible
that
he
exposed
himself
more
than
was
really
necessary
did
not
enter
his
mind
he
failed
to
consider
that
if
he
were
killed
nobody
would
be
able
to
give
timely
warning
at
the
rito
and
that
the
very
search
for
him
might
expose
his
people
to
the
danger
which
he
was
striving
to
avert
death
had
little
terror
for
him
it
was
nothing
but
the
end
of
all
pain
and
trouble
as
soon
as
topanashka
believed
that
he
had
come
again
into
proximity
of
the
path
he
resumed
his
previous
methods
of
locomotion
that
is
he
began
to
crawl
on
hands
and
feet
the
timber
was
of
greater
density
here
for
it
was
nearer
the
foot
of
the
mountains
in
proportion
as
the
trees
become
taller
and
as
they
stand
closer
together
the
ground
below
is
freer
from
shrubbery
and
may
be
scanned
from
a
certain
distance
with
greater
ease
nevertheless
the
soil
is
more
rocky
ledges
crop
out
on
the
surface
isolated
blocks
appear
boulders
and
sometimes
low
protuberances
when
topanashka
felt
certain
of
the
proximity
of
the
trail
he
scanned
the
ground
very
carefully
it
was
still
flat
notwithstanding
some
rocky
patches
the
shade
was
deep
and
as
far
as
the
eye
reached
nothing
moved
nothing
suspicious
was
seen
nay
nothing
that
bore
life
except
the
sombre
vegetation
the
wind
increased
in
force
the
pines
faintly
murmured
from
time
to
time
a
blast
penetrated
beneath
them
to
the
surface
of
the
soil
chasing
the
dry
needles
in
fitful
whirls
or
playing
with
the
tall
that
were
growing
profusely
here
if
any
man
was
about
he
certainly
kept
outside
the
range
of
vision
so
the
old
man
reasoned
and
he
began
to
creep
toward
a
place
where
the
smoothness
of
the
rocks
indicated
the
wear
and
tear
of
human
feet
it
was
the
only
trace
of
the
trail
and
barely
visible
as
he
approached
the
place
he
knew
that
he
must
be
seen
but
he
relied
upon
the
fact
that
a
man
lying
flat
on
the
ground
is
very
difficult
to
hit
an
arrow
could
scarcely
strike
him
and
in
no
case
could
the
wound
be
other
than
slight
for
the
shot
must
come
from
a
distance
as
there
was
he
felt
certain
no
one
near
by
he
glided
like
a
snake
or
rather
like
a
huge
lizard
which
crawls
over
obstacles
and
whose
body
adapts
itself
to
depressions
instead
of
crossing
or
bridging
them
over
his
cautious
progress
scarcely
caused
a
leaf
to
rustle
or
a
stone
to
rattle
and
these
noises
were
perceptible
only
in
the
vicinity
of
where
they
were
produced
so
he
pushed
himself
gradually
close
up
to
a
ledge
which
while
of
indifferent
height
still
protected
his
body
somewhat
on
this
ledge
he
expected
to
notice
scratches
which
indicated
that
the
trail
passed
over
it
it
was
as
he
suspected
the
rock
was
slightly
worn
by
human
feet
but
of
fresh
tracks
there
could
of
course
be
no
trace
here
for
only
long
and
constant
wear
and
tear
and
not
an
occasional
hurried
tread
can
leave
marks
behind
but
topanashka
noticed
a
few
fragments
of
rock
and
little
bits
of
stone
that
lay
alongside
the
old
channel
without
lifting
his
head
he
extended
his
arm
grasped
some
of
the
fragments
and
began
to
examine
them
loose
rocks
or
stones
that
have
been
lying
on
the
ground
undisturbed
for
some
time
always
have
their
lower
surface
moist
while
the
upper
dries
rapidly
when
the
yellowish
tufa
of
these
regions
becomes
wet
it
changes
colour
and
grows
of
a
darker
hue
topanashka
had
noticed
that
some
among
the
stones
which
he
was
examining
were
darker
than
the
others
the
indian
when
he
examines
anything
looks
at
it
very
carefully
one
of
the
fragments
was
darker
on
the
surface
of
this
he
felt
sure
as
when
he
removed
them
he
was
careful
to
keep
them
as
they
lay
below
the
piece
had
its
natural
colour
that
of
dry
stone
he
assured
himself
that
the
darker
shade
really
proceeded
from
humidity
it
was
still
moist
the
fragment
therefore
must
have
been
turned
over
and
that
too
a
very
short
time
ago
only
a
large
animal
or
a
man
could
have
done
this
he
looked
closely
to
see
whether
there
were
any
scratches
indicative
of
the
passage
of
or
but
there
were
none
except
those
that
appeared
so
large
as
to
show
plainly
from
a
distance
there
was
every
likelihood
therefore
that
some
human
being
had
but
very
lately
moved
the
stones
and
not
only
since
the
rain
of
last
night
but
since
the
surface
had
had
time
to
dry
again
that
is
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
he
moved
his
body
forward
where
he
could
examine
the
soil
alongside
the
ledge
the
grass
was
nowhere
bent
and
broken
still
that
was
no
sufficient
indication
there
at
last
was
a
plain
human
track
the
impression
of
a
naked
foot
with
its
to
the
north
and
the
impression
was
fresh
but
the
tehua
walked
on
round
sandals
had
he
not
lost
one
of
them
it
was
very
uncomfortable
walking
on
one
of
the
circular
disks
only
topanashka
rose
on
hands
and
feet
and
crept
farther
regardless
of
what
might
be
behind
him
his
eyes
were
directed
northward
and
he
relied
upon
his
ear
to
warn
him
of
danger
in
the
rear
the
trail
lay
before
him
quite
distinct
for
a
short
distance
close
to
it
some
grasses
were
bent
and
on
the
sandy
place
near
by
there
was
a
print
as
if
from
a
small
hoop
but
the
impression
was
old
and
partly
blurred
in
vain
did
the
old
warrior
search
for
other
marks
the
rain
had
obliterated
everything
except
this
faint
trace
that
might
originally
have
been
plainer
because
deeper
it
looked
as
if
the
wearer
of
the
sandal
had
stepped
on
the
with
the
fore
part
of
his
foot
slipped
back
lightly
and
thus
pressed
the
hind
part
of
the
hoop
deeper
into
the
soil
in
that
case
some
trace
of
the
might
still
be
found
and
indeed
a
very
slight
concavity
appeared
behind
the
impression
of
the
sandal
the
heel
was
turned
from
the
north
consequently
the
man
was
going
to
not
coming
from
the
rito
the
tracks
were
surely
old
ones
everything
was
plain
now
the
tehua
had
lost
one
of
his
sandals
and
was
returning
on
his
bare
feet
but
why
should
he
leave
it
why
did
he
not
take
it
along
even
that
topanashka
could
easily
explain
people
from
the
rito
frequently
roamed
over
the
northern
mesa
close
to
the
tyuonyi
he
might
have
noticed
the
presence
of
some
of
them
and
have
fled
in
haste
leaving
his
behind
most
likely
the
ties
or
thongs
had
given
way
and
he
had
no
time
to
mend
them
that
was
an
evidence
also
that
the
man
was
alone
else
he
would
not
have
fled
with
such
precipitation
neither
was
he
in
this
vicinity
any
longer
topanashka
felt
that
his
task
was
done
he
could
not
gain
anything
by
proceeding
farther
kuawk
kuawk
kuawk
sounded
overhead
a
crow
had
been
sitting
quietly
on
the
tree
above
him
but
now
it
flew
off
again
the
unlucky
bird
its
cry
startled
the
old
man
and
he
raised
his
head
to
look
after
the
herald
of
evil
following
him
with
his
eye
all
was
still
then
he
rose
to
his
knees
a
sharp
humming
twang
a
hissing
sound
and
a
thud
followed
in
succession
topanashka
bends
over
and
at
the
same
time
tumbles
forward
on
his
face
there
he
lies
the
left
cheek
and
shoulder
on
the
ground
the
left
arm
with
which
he
has
sought
to
support
the
body
has
slipped
and
it
now
lies
fully
extended
partly
below
the
head
the
prostrate
head
the
chest
is
heaving
painfully
as
if
under
extraordinary
pressure
face
and
neck
are
colouring
the
lips
part
the
throat
makes
a
convulsive
effort
to
swallow
the
eyes
are
starting
they
denote
suffocation
and
terrible
pain
the
legs
twitch
they
seem
struggling
to
come
to
the
rescue
of
the
body
upper
half
from
the
back
of
the
old
man
there
protrudes
an
arrowshaft
it
has
pierced
it
close
to
the
spine
between
it
and
the
right
penetrating
into
the
lungs
where
it
now
stabs
and
smarts
from
a
distant
there
sounds
the
hoarse
kuawk
kuawk
of
the
crow
otherwise
all
is
still
the
wounded
man
coughs
with
the
cough
blood
comes
to
his
lips
light
red
blood
the
thighs
begin
to
struggle
as
if
formication
was
going
on
in
the
muscles
it
is
an
impotent
movement
and
yet
is
done
consciously
for
the
trunk
of
the
body
which
was
beginning
more
and
more
to
yield
now
begins
to
turn
clumsily
backward
the
left
hand
clutches
the
soil
the
arm
is
trying
to
heave
to
lift
but
the
weight
is
too
heavy
the
shaft
inside
too
firmly
and
too
deeply
rooted
nevertheless
the
hips
succeed
in
rising
the
trunk
follows
then
it
tumbles
over
on
the
back
contracts
with
a
moan
of
pain
and
suffering
and
lies
there
trembling
with
spasmodic
shivers
topanashka
has
made
this
superhuman
effort
for
a
purpose
he
feels
that
his
wound
is
severe
that
his
strength
is
gone
his
senses
are
darkened
and
his
thoughts
confused
still
there
is
a
spark
of
life
left
and
that
spark
demands
that
he
should
attempt
to
see
whence
came
the
arrow
that
so
terribly
lacerates
his
breast
but
as
he
has
fallen
over
heavily
the
point
of
the
arrow
has
been
pressed
deeper
flint
an
of
flint
with
notched
edges
tears
the
muscles
do
not
close
about
the
intruder
the
blood
flows
into
the
chest
it
fills
the
lungs
he
suffocates
yet
all
consciousness
has
not
vanished
although
pain
and
oppression
overwhelm
the
physical
instruments
of
consciousness
and
deprive
the
will
of
its
connection
with
its
tools
the
will
longs
to
see
him
who
has
destroyed
its
abode
but
it
no
longer
controls
the
shattered
tissues
the
nerves
shiver
like
the
broken
springs
of
clockwork
ere
they
come
to
a
forever
the
eye
still
distinguishes
light
occasionally
but
it
can
not
see
any
longer
weaker
and
weaker
become
the
breathings
on
both
sides
of
the
mouth
a
fold
begins
to
form
over
the
blood
that
has
curdled
and
dried
new
fillets
stream
to
the
lips
from
within
the
legs
still
twitch
convulsively
now
a
stream
of
blood
gushes
from
the
open
mouth
wave
after
wave
rushes
up
with
such
swiftness
that
bubbles
and
froth
form
between
the
lips
and
remain
there
a
chill
pervades
the
whole
body
it
is
the
last
nervous
tremor
the
lower
jaw
hangs
down
showing
with
fearful
distinctness
the
folds
the
ghastly
folds
of
death
all
is
still
through
the
tops
of
the
pines
comes
a
humming
sound
like
a
chant
a
last
lay
to
the
brave
and
dutiful
man
still
stark
and
stiff
he
lies
in
his
gore
his
career
is
ended
his
soul
has
gone
to
rest
and
thus
all
remained
quiet
for
a
short
time
then
the
grass
was
waved
and
shaken
in
the
direction
to
which
the
old
man
had
turned
his
back
in
the
last
hapless
moment
the
grass
seemed
to
grow
to
suddenly
rise
and
a
figure
appeared
which
had
been
lying
flat
behind
a
projecting
rocky
ledge
as
this
figure
straightened
itself
bunches
of
grass
dropped
from
its
back
to
the
ground
it
was
the
figure
of
a
man
but
it
is
not
the
tehua
indian
who
stands
there
motionless
with
bow
half
drawn
and
an
arrow
in
readiness
who
gazes
over
to
the
corpse
to
see
whether
it
is
really
a
corpse
or
whether
it
will
need
a
second
shaft
to
despatch
it
forever
the
man
is
of
middle
height
and
spare
shaggy
hair
bristles
from
under
the
strands
that
surround
his
head
like
a
turban
he
wears
nothing
but
a
kilt
of
deerskin
from
his
shoulders
hangs
a
quiver
a
flint
knife
depends
from
the
belt
this
man
is
no
village
indian
notwithstanding
that
dark
paint
on
his
body
it
is
one
of
the
hereditary
foes
of
the
sedentary
aborigines
a
navajo
he
is
eying
the
dead
body
suspiciously
if
it
is
surely
dead
the
second
arrow
may
be
saved
those
glassy
eyes
that
sallow
face
and
the
fold
the
ghastly
fold
that
runs
on
both
sides
of
the
mouth
of
that
mouth
filled
with
blood
now
clotting
they
show
that
life
is
gone
still
the
savage
keeps
his
bow
well
in
hand
as
with
head
and
neck
extended
he
steals
forward
slowly
mistrustfully
approaching
his
victim
when
he
is
close
to
the
body
his
eyes
sparkle
with
delight
and
pride
and
his
face
gleams
with
the
triumph
of
some
hellish
spirit
he
touches
the
corpse
it
is
warm
but
surely
lifeless
he
grasps
at
the
wrap
it
is
of
no
value
to
him
although
made
of
cotton
beneath
however
there
must
be
something
that
attracts
his
attention
for
he
quickly
tears
off
the
scanty
dress
and
fumbles
about
the
chest
of
the
victim
a
horrible
grin
of
delight
distorts
his
features
already
hideously
begrimed
for
he
has
found
the
little
bag
and
takes
from
it
the
fetich
of
the

is
a
prize
for
with
it
the
magic
power
that
was
subservient
to
the
victim
while
alive
now
becomes
the
victor
he
handles
the
amulet
carefully
almost
tenderly
breathes
on
it
and
puts
it
back
into
the
bag
then
he
detaches
his
stone
knife
grasps
it
with
the
right
hand
and
with
the
left
clutches
the
gray
hair
of
the
dead
man
and
with
a
sudden
jerk
pulls
the
head
up
then
he
begins
to
cut
the
scalp
with
his
shaggy
of
flint
a
faint
whistling
sound
as
of
some
one
hissing
near
him
is
heard
and
ere
he
looks
up
a
male
voice
by
his
side
has
said
that
is
good
very
good
the
words
are
spoken
in
the
dinne
language
the
murderer
looks
up
staying
his
work
of
mutilation
by
his
side
there
stands
another
navajo
dressed
painted
and
armed
like
himself
a
short
time
after
he
had
risen
from
his
and
was
stealing
over
toward
the
body
of
his
victim
this
other
navajo
had
appeared
in
sight
he
watched
from
the
distance
his
companion
proceedings
and
as
he
recognized
that
he
was
busying
himself
with
some
dead
body
approached
rapidly
though
without
the
least
noise
he
discovered
the
dead
stood
still
fastened
a
piercing
glance
on
the
prostrate
form
and
heaved
a
great
sigh
of
relief
notwithstanding
the
paint
on
his
face
it
was
easy
to
see
how
delighted
he
was
at
the
sight
he
again
advanced
not
unlike
a
cat
which
is
afraid
to
go
too
near
another
that
is
playing
with
a
mouse
for
fear
of
being
scratched
or
bitten
by
her
but
when
unobserved
he
had
reached
the
navajo
he
could
not
withhold
a
joyful
exclamation
that
startled
and
interrupted
the
murderer
he
asked
dost
thou
know
who
that
is
the
other
shrugged
his
shoulders
that
is
topanashka
the
strong
and
wise
warrior
that
is
very
very
good
navajo
number
two
looked
closely
at
the
corpse
then
he
grasped
the
hair
again
and
resumed
the
cutting
number
one
touched
his
arm
why
do
you
do
this
he
asked
the
other
chuckled
dost
thou
not
see
it
nacaytzusle
said
he
the
people
of
the
houses
know
that
we
only
take
a
lock
of
the
hair
if
now
they
find
the
body
and
see
that
this
he
pointed
to
the
skin
is
gone
they
will
think
it
is
one
of
those
up
here
waving
his
hand
to
the
north
that
has
done
it
nacaytzusle
for
he
was
indeed
the
second
navajo
nodded
approvingly
and
suffered
the
other
to
go
on
cutting
scraping
tearing
and
pulling
he
at
last
succeeded
in
making
a
deep
incision
around
the
skull
blood
flowed
over
his
fingers
and
hands
then
he
grasped
the
gray
hair
planted
himself
with
both
feet
on
the
neck
and
pulled
until
the
scalp
was
wrenched
off
and
dangled
in
his
fist
over
the
bare
skull
numberless
fillets
of
blood
began
to
trickle
at
once
changing
the
face
and
neck
of
the
dead
into
a
red
mass
then
he
turned
to
the
other
nodded
and
said
it
is
well
nacaytzusle
turned
his
eyes
upon
the
dead
and
replied
in
a
hoarse
voice
it
is
well
he
scanned
the
surroundings
suspiciously
thou
hast
done
well
very
well
he
said
to
the
murderer
thou
art
strong
and
cunning
this
one
he
touched
the
body
with
his
toes
was
strong
and
wise
also
but
now
he
is
so
no
longer
now
he
hissed
we
can
go
down
into
the
tu
atzissi
and
get
what
we
want
what
dost
thou
mean
nacaytzusle
inquired
the
victorious
navajo
go
thou
back
to
the
hogan
whispered
nacaytzusle
to
him
and
tell
the
men
to
be
there
pointing
southwestward
four
days
from
now
i
will
be
there
and
will
speak
to
them
the
other
nodded
let
us
go
said
he
they
moved
off
in
silence
without
casting
another
glance
at
the
dead
their
direction
was
southwest
they
carefully
avoided
making
the
least
noise
they
spied
and
peered
cautiously
in
every
direction
shy
suspicious
thus
they
vanished
in
the
forest
like
wolves
sneaking
through
timber
evening
had
set
in
stronger
blew
the
wind
and
the
top
of
the
pines
shook
occasionally
with
a
solemn
rushing
sound
that
resembled
distant
thunder
the
breeze
swayed
the
grass
the
blades
nodded
and
bowed
beside
the
remains
of
the
brave
man
as
if
they
were
asking
his
forgiveness
for
the
bloody
deed
of
which
they
had
been
the
innocent
witnesses
a
crow
came
up
flapping
her
wings
and
alighted
on
a
tree
which
stood
near
the
corpse
and
peered
down
upon
the
body
then
she
croaked
hoarsely
jumped
to
a
lower
limb
and
peered
again
thus
the
bird
continued
to
descend
from
one
branch
to
another
croaking
and
chuckling
as
it
were
to
herself
at
last
she
fluttered
down
to
the
ground
a
few
paces
from
the
body
peeped
slyly
over
to
where
it
lay
and
walked
toward
it
with
slow
stately
steps
and
eager
nods
but
something
rattled
in
the
distance
the
bird
head
turned
to
the
east
and
as
quick
as
lightning
she
rose
in
the
air
and
flew
off
with
a
loud
angry
kuawk
kuawk
kuawk
two
men
are
coming
toward
the
spot
they
are
indians
from
tyuonyi
who
came
up
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
with
bows
and
arrows
they
perceive
the
body
and
the
blood
on
it
and
around
it
both
stand
still
terrified
at
the
sight
at
last
one
of
them
exclaims
it
is
one
from
the
zaashtesh
they
run
together
to
the
spot
heedless
of
the
danger
which
may
yet
be
lurking
about
they
bend
over
the
dead
then
look
at
each
other
speechless
confused
at
last
they
find
words
and
exclaim
simultaneously
it
is
our
father
topanashka
tihua
it
is
sa
nashtio
maseua
both
men
are
young
yet
they
weep
their
sorrow
is
so
great
in
presence
of
the
loss
sustained
by
them
and
by
all
that
they
forget
all
caution
had
the
navajos
been
about
still
two
more
of
the
would
have
fallen
they
attempt
to
decide
what
is
to
be
done
their
thoughts
become
confused
for
the
terrible
discovery
distracts
them
little
by
little
they
become
conscious
that
it
is
impossible
to
leave
the
body
here
a
prey
to
the
wolves
and
carrion
crows
that
it
must
be
brought
home
down
into
the
valley
where
he
was
so
beloved
so
worshipped
almost
by
everybody
nothing
else
can
be
done
with
sighs
and
sobs
stifled
groans
and
tears
the
body
is
raised
up
one
supporting
the
head
the
other
the
feet
thus
they
drag
and
carry
it
along
on
the
old
trail
to
the
rito
blood
clings
to
their
hands
and
to
their
dress
never
mind
is
it
not
the
blood
of
a
good
man
and
may
not
with
that
blood
some
of
his
good
qualities
perhaps
pass
into
them
not
a
word
is
spoken
not
even
when
they
lay
down
the
corpse
to
rest
themselves
a
while
in
such
moments
they
stand
motionless
one
by
the
mutilated
head
the
other
at
the
feet
they
look
neither
at
each
other
nor
at
it
for
if
they
should
attempt
it
tears
would
be
sure
to
come
to
their
eyes
without
a
word
they
lift
up
the
body
again
tenderly
as
if
it
were
a
child
and
on
they
go
slowly
painfully
and
silently
it
is
night
now
and
the
forest
is
more
full
of
life
the
dread
voices
of
the
darkness
are
heard
around
them
coyotes
howl
and
whine
in
the
distance
owls
hiss
and
shriek
and
flit
from
tree
to
tree
as
the
panting
men
approach
they
think
not
of
danger
not
even
of
those
who
so
ruthlessly
slaughtered
their
great
and
good
maseua
on
they
go
as
fast
as
the
heavy
load
permits
and
as
their
heavy
hearts
afford
them
strength
now
one
of
them
stumbles
and
falls
and
as
he
rises
he
notices
that
the
object
over
which
he
has
tripped
is
still
clinging
to
his
foot
he
can
not
see
what
it
is
but
grasping
it
discovers
a
round
over
which
he
has
stumbled
whose
thongs
have
remained
between
his
toes
this
discovery
he
communicates
to
his
companion
with
fresh
vigour
they
resume
their
dismal
march
it
is
dark
so
dark
that
nothing
more
can
be
seen
nothing
more
is
heard
save
distant
thunder
and
the
discordant
voices
of
the
night
in
the
forest
slowly
and
silently
they
proceed
homeward
with
their
gory
but
precious
burden

lamentations
over
a
dead
body
are
everywhere
a
sad
and
sickening
performance
to
witness
and
to
hear
among
the
aborigines
of
new
mexico
among
the
sedentary
tribes
at
least
the
official
is
carried
on
for
four
days
the
number
four
plays
a
conspicuous
rôle
in
the
lives
of
those
people
and
it
is
natural
that
it
should
four
are
the
cardinal
points
four
the
seasons
four
times
five
digits
depend
from
hands
and
feet
the
queres
has
not
even
a
distinct
term
for
finger
or
for
toe
he
designates
the
former
as
one
above
the
hand
the
latter
as
one
above
the
foot
four
days
the
redman
fasts
or
does
penance
four
days
he
mourns
for
that
is
the
time
required
by
the
soul
to
travel
from
the
place
where
it
has
been
liberated
from
the
thralls
of
earthly
life
to
the
place
of
eternal
felicity
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
speaking
the
body
was
still
cremated
and
with
it
everything
that
made
up
the
personal
effects
of
the
deceased
if
a
man
his
clothes
his
weapons
his
loom
in
case
he
had
practised
the
art
of
weaving
were
burned
if
a
woman
the
cooking
utensils
were
killed
that
is
either
perforated
at
the
bottom
or
broken
over
the
funeral
pyre
and
afterward
consumed
in
this
manner
the
deceased
was
accompanied
by
his
worldly
goods
in
the
shape
of
smoke
and
steam
through
that
air
in
which
the
soul
travelled
toward
shipapu
in
the
mythical
north
the
road
must
be
long
to
shipapu
else
it
would
not
require
four
entire
days
to
reach
it
and
there
are
neither
nor
houses
on
the
way
where
the
dead
may
stop
for
refreshments
therefore
the
survivors
placed
on
the
spot
where
the
body
had
rested
for
the
last
time
an
effigy
of
the
dead
a
wooden
carving
and
covered
it
with
a
piece
of
cloth
while
by
the
side
of
this
effigy
they
deposited
food
and
water
in
order
that
neither
cold
hunger
nor
thirst
might
cause
the
travelling
spirit
to
suffer
but
the
road
is
not
only
long
it
is
also
dangerous
evil
spirits
lie
in
wait
for
the
deceased
to
capture
him
if
possible
and
hamper
his
ultimate
felicity
to
protect
himself
against
them
a
small
is
added
to
the
other
necessaries
and
to
render
the
journey
safe
beyond
a
doubt
a
magic
circle
is
drawn
encompassing
the
statuette
with
a
circle
of
cruciform
marks
imitating
the
footprints
of
the
shashka
or
as
these
crosses
point
in
all
four
directions
it
is
supposed
that
evil
spirits
will
become
bewildered
and
unable
to
pursue
the
soul
in
its
transit
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
day
with
many
prayers
and
ceremonies
the
circle
is
obliterated
and
the
other
objects
including
the
effigy
are
taken
away
by
the
shamans
to
be
disposed
of
in
a
manner
known
to
them
alone
during
the
period
of
official
mourning
the
loud
wail
was
carried
on
incessantly
or
at
least
at
frequent
intervals
fasting
was
practised
the
women
wept
sobbed
screamed
and
yelled
both
sexes
gathered
daily
around
the
place
where
the
effigy
lay
praying
loudly
for
the
safe
journey
and
arrival
at
shipapu
of
the
defunct
the
women
alone
shed
tears
on
such
occasions
the
men
only
stared
with
a
gloomy
face
and
thoughtful
mien
they
recalled
and
remembered
the
dead
what
the
great
master
of
historical
composition
has
said

by

monotonous

the

her

moved

no

when
the
leader
of
the
choir
broke
out
with
appropriate
gesticulations
she
chimed
in
loudly
when
at
such
a
signal
the
other
women
present
began
to
tear
their
hair
she
did
the
same
and
shouted
at
the
top
of
her
voice
like
the
others
group
after
group
of
mourners
visited
the
room
until
both
clans
tanyi

hannay
too
had
made
her
appearance
she
had
shed
tears
like
a
had
howled
and
whined
more
than
any
one
else
her
grief
was
surely
assumed
for
when
tyope
asked
her
in
the
evening
she
told
him
everything
in
detail
that
she
had
noticed
how
this
one
had
looked
how
such
and
such
a
one
had
yelled
plainly
showing
that
the
flood
of
tears
had
in
no
manner
impeded
her
faculties
of
perception
the
sighs
and
sobs
around
her
in
no
manner
deafened
her
attentive
ear
tyope
listened
with
apparent
indifference
and
said
nothing
she
attended
to
the
weeping
part
he
not
so
much
to
the
duty
of
pious
recollection
as
to
that
of
deep
thinking
over
the
new
phase
which
matters
had
entered
upon
in
consequence
of
the
bloody
event
for
this
sudden
death
of
the
maseua
was
for
his
designs
a
most
fortunate
occurrence
the
only
man
who
in
the
prospective
strife
between
the
clans
might
have
taken
an
attitude
dangerous
perhaps
disastrous
to
his
purposes
was
now
dead
and
the
office
which
that
man
held
had
become
vacant
there
was
but
one
individual
left
in
the
tribe
who
might
yet
prove
a
to
him
that
was
the
hishtanyi
chayan
but
the
great
was
not
so
much
a
man
of
action
as
a
man
of
words
and
the
force
of
his
oracular
utterances
tyope
hoped
to
destroy
through
the
powerful
speeches
of
the
koshare
naua
and
the
strong
medicine
of
the
shkuy
chayan
the
plans
of
tyope
had
been
immensely
furthered
by
the
terrible
accident
they
had
advanced
so
much
that
he
felt
it
indispensable
to
modify
them
to
some
extent
terror
and
dismay
were
great
at
the
rito
and
the
council
had
been
adjourned
there
could
be
no
thought
of
a
fresh
accusation
against
shotaye
until
the
four
days
of
official
mourning
were
past
and
the
campaign
against
the
enemy
which
the
bloody
outrage
imperatively
called
for
the
murder
by
the
tehuas
as
tyope
and
the
others
believed
of
the
principal
of
the
tribe
at
a
time
when
the
two
tribes
were
without
any
communication
with
each
other
was
too
great
an
outrage
not
to
demand
immediate
revenge
the
murder
could
not
have
been
the
result
of
a
misunderstanding
or
accident
else
the
scalp
would
not
have
been
taken
by
the
murderer
it
was
premeditated
an
act
of
deliberate
hostility
a
declaration
of
war
on
the
part
of
the
tehuas
the
dead
man
scalp
had
certainly
wandered
over
to
the
caves
of
the
northern
tribe
it
was
certainly
paraded
there
in
the
solemn
by
which
the
tehuas
beyond
all
doubt
publicly
honoured
and
rewarded
the
murderer
tyope
knew
that
the
queres
were
of
one
mind
and
that
the
official
mourning
alone
kept
them
from
replying
to
this
act
of
unjustifiable
hostility
by
an
attack
upon
the
puye
but
he
also
knew
that
as
soon
as
the
four
days
were
past
a
campaign
against
the
tehuas
would
be
set
on
foot
the
hishtanyi
chayan
had
retired
to
work
and
that
meant
war
he
and
the
shikama
chayan
fasted
and
mourned
together
their
mourning
was
not
only
on
account
of
the
great
loss
suffered
by
the
tribe
in
the
person
of
the
deceased
they
bewailed
a
loss
of
power
that
power
had
gone
over
into
the
enemy
ranks
with
the
scalp
of
the
murdered
man
although
the
death
of
topanashka
was
for
tyope
an
event
of
incalculable
benefit
he
had
exhibited
tokens
of
regret
and
sorrow
his
manner
was
dignified
he
did
not
mourn
in
any
extravagant
fashion
but
conducted
himself
so
that
nobody
could
suspect
the
death
of
the
old
man
to
be
anything
else
than
a
source
of
regret
to
him
furthermore
he
intended
by
his
own
example
to
foster
the
idea
among
his
tribal
brethren
that
the
outrage
was
so
grave
that
it
demanded
immediate
and
prompt
redress
the
carrying
out
of
this
redress
was
of
the
greatest
importance
to
him
the
sooner
it
was
executed
the
better
it
would
suit
his
plans
during
the
last
interview
of
tyope
with
the
young
navajo
the
latter
had
charged
him
with
having
asked
the
dinne
to
kill
the
old
maseua
during
an
incursion
which
his
tribe
were
to
make
into
the
valley
of
the
rito
it
was
true
that
tyope
had
suggested
it
but
he
had
not
told
the
navajo
all
that
he
designed
through
this
act
of
treachery
his
object
was
not
merely
to
rid
himself
of
the
person
of
topanashka
he
sought
an
opportunity
of
becoming
the
ostensible
saviour
of
his
tribe
in
the
hour
of
need
if
the
dinne
had
made
the
premeditated
onslaught
he
would
after
he
had
given
them
time
to
perform
the
murder
have
appeared
upon
the
scene
driven
off
the
assailants
and
thus
recommended
himself
to
the
people
for
the
vacant
position
of
the
game
was
a
double
one
on
his
part
first
he
was
to
betray
his
kinsfolk
to
the
navajos
and
secondly
to
turn
against
the
navajos
in
defense
of
the
betrayed
ones
tyope
realized
that
it
was
a
very
dangerous
game
and
he
had
therefore
desisted
and
even
gone
so
far
as
to
repel
the
young
navajo
at
the
risk
of
his
own
life
as
matters
stood
all
had
gone
far
better
than
he
ever
hoped
for
without
complicity
on
his
part
topanashka
had
been
put
out
of
his
way
and
the
office
coveted
by
tyope
was
vacant
an
important
military
enterprise
was
to
follow
at
once
tyope
intended
to
go
on
this
campaign
at
all
hazards
in
order
to
distinguish
himself
as
much
as
possible
this
he
was
able
to
do
for
he
possessed
all
the
physical
qualities
necessary
for
a
powerful
indian
warrior
and
he
was
very
crafty
cunning
bold
and
experienced
he
belonged
to
the
society
of
war
magicians
and
held
in
his
possession
most
of
the
charms
and
fetiches
used
for
securing
invincibility
there
was
no
doubt
in
his
mind
that
he
would
return
from
the
crowned
with
glory
and
with
scalps
provided
he
was
not
killed
should
he
return
alive
then
the
time
would
come
for
him
to
set
the
koshare
naua
to
work
to
secure
him
the
desired
position
once
made
maseua
he
would
resume
his
former
plans
push
the
case
against
shotaye
to
the
bitter
end
and
try
to
divide
the
tribe
for
the
present
the
two
objects
had
to
be
set
aside
the
expedition
against
the
tehuas
must
take
the
lead
of
everything
else
while
tyope
was
prompted
by
the
grief
and
mourning
that
prevailed
to
display
fresh
activity
and
resort
to
new
intrigues
while
at
the
same
time
his
wife
improved
the
occasion
for
her
customary
prying
listening
and
gossip
their
daughter
mitsha
on
the
other
hand
really
mourned
sincerely
and
grieved
bitterly
she
mourned
for
the
dead
with
the
candour
of
a
child
and
the
feeling
of
a
woman
when
she
too
had
gone
to
the
house
of
the
dead
to
pray
her
tears
flowed
abundantly
and
they
were
genuine
the
girl
did
not
weep
merely
on
account
of
the
deceased
for
she
could
not
know
his
real
worth
and
merits
she
grieved
quite
as
much
on
okoya
account
the
boy
had
been
to
see
her
every
evening
of
late
he
was
there
on
the
night
when
the
corpse
was
brought
home
and
they
heard
the
wail
and
rushed
out
on
the
roof
at
that
moment
hannay
had
returned
full
to
the
brim
with
the
dismal
news
okoya
forgot
everything
and
returned
home
and
mitsha
went
back
to
the
room
and
wept
while
her
mother
proceeded
in
her
account
with
noisy
volubility
mitsha
cried
for
okoya
had
often
spoken
of
his
grandfather
telling
her
how
wise
strong
and
good
sa
umo
maseua
was
she
felt
that
the
young
man
looked
up
to
him
as
to
an
ideal
and
she
wept
quite
as
much
because
of
her
feeling
for
okoya
as
for
the
murdered
of
her
people
while
she
thus
mourned
from
the
bottom
of
her
heart
the
thought
came
to
her
how
she
would
feel
in
case
her
father
was
brought
home
in
the
same
way
mitsha
was
a
good
child
and
tyope
had
always
treated
her
not
only
with
affection
but
with
kindness
he
gave
her
many
precious
things
as
the
indian
calls
the
pebbles
shell
beads
base
turquoises
crystals
with
which
he
decorates
his
body
he
liked
to
see
his
daughter
shine
among
the
daughters
of
the
tribe
with
him
it
was
speculation
not
affection
but
mitsha
knew
nothing
of
this
and
felt
that
in
case
her
parent
should
ever
be
borne
back
to
this
house
dead
and
placed
on
the
floor
before
her
covered
with
gore
she
must
feel
just
as
okoya
felt
now
and
yet
the
dead
man
was
only
his
grandparent
no
it
was
not
possible
for
him
to
be
as
sad
as
she
would
be
in
case
tyope
should
meet
with
such
a
fate
and
then
she
wondered
whether
the
whole
tribe
would
regret
her
father
death
as
much
as
they
regretted
the
loss
of
topanashka
something
within
her
told
that
it
would
not
she
had
already
noticed
that
tyope
was
not
liked
but
why
she
knew
not
okoya
himself
had
intimated
as
much
she
knew
that
the
boy
shunned
her
father
and
her
attachment
to
okoya
had
become
so
deep
that
his
utterances
began
to
modify
her
feelings
toward
her
own
parents
if
she
would
sorrow
and
grieve
for
her
father
loss
if
okoya
was
mourning
over
his
grandfather
demise
how
must
the
child
of
the
murdered
man
of
such
a
man
as
topanashka
feel
his
only
child
was
a
woman
like
herself
a
true
woman
always
feels
for
her
sex
and
sympathizes
with
other
women
grief
and
besides
that
woman
was
the
mother
of
the
youth
who
had
won
her
heart
okoya
had
told
her
a
great
deal
about
his
mother
how
good
she
was
and
how
content
she
was
to
see
him
and
her
become
one
the
girl
was
anxious
to
know
his
mother
but
a
visit
to
a
prospective
is
by
no
means
an
unimportant
step
if
it
is
accompanied
by
a
present
it
bears
the
character
of
an
official
acceptance
of
courtship
that
step
mitsha
was
afraid
as
yet
to
take
it
was
too
early
there
were
too
many
contingencies
in
the
way
still
she
longed
to
go
to
say
koitza
now
but
visits
of
condolence
are
not
in
vogue
among
indians
as
long
as
there
is
loud
mourning
except
at
the
house
where
the
mourning
is
going
on
how
much
mitsha
would
have
given
to
be
permitted
to
go
to
say
sit
down
quietly
in
a
corner
and
modestly
and
without
speaking
a
word
weep
in
her
company
at
the
same
time
she
felt
another
longing
since
the
night
of
the
murder
okoya
had
of
course
not
been
to
see
her
and
she
naturally
longed
to
meet
him
also
in
this
hour
of
sadness
and
trial
once
when
she
had
gone
to
the
brook
for
water
zashue
had
crossed
her
path
but
he
looked
so
dark
and
frowning
that
she
did
not
venture
even
to
greet
him
it
was
the
last
day
of
mourning
and
nearly
everybody
at
the
rito
who
could
or
ought
had
paid
his
respects
to
the
dead
the
chayani
of
lesser
rank
alone
returned
from
time
to
time
to
perform
specially
strong
incantations
in
aid
of
the
still
travelling
soul
mitsha
had
gone
down
to
the
brook
to
get
water
it
occurred
only
once
a
day
during
these
days
for
the
people
of
tyame
fasted
taking
but
one
frugal
meal
daily
everybody
was
very
careful
also
not
to
wash
and
mitsha
herself
was
as
unkempt
as
any
one
else
of
her
clan
bearing
the
huashtanyi
on
her
head
she
was
returning
when
as
she
passed
the
corner
of
the
big
house
her
eyes
discovered
a
man
standing
with
his
back
turned
to
her
gazing
at
the
cliffs
he
seemed
to
face
the
dwellings
of
the
eagle
clan
as
the
girl
approached
the
noise
of
her
step
caused
him
to
turn
and
she
recognized
okoya
the
youth
stepped
up
to
her
his
eyes
were
hollow
and
now
they
became
moist
he
attempted
to
control
himself
to
restrain
the
tears
that
were
coming
to
his
eyes
at
the
sight
of
her
but
he
sobbed
convulsively
when
she
saw
it
tears
came
to
her
eyes
at
once
the
two
children
stood
there
he
struggling
to
hide
his
grief
for
it
was
unmanly
to
weep
and
yet
he
was
young
and
could
not
control
his
feelings
she
as
a
woman
feeling
at
liberty
to
weep
she
wept
but
silently
and
modestly
it
grieved
her
to
see
him
shed
tears
he
too
felt
for
her
but
it
was
soothing
to
his
own
grief
that
mitsha
mourned
he
too
was
longing
to
meet
her
the
four
days
of
separation
had
been
very
long
to
him
he
was
so
good
okoya
at
last
succeeded
in
saying
fresh
tears
came
to
his
eyes
mitsha
merely
nodded
and
covered
her
face
with
a
corner
of
her
wrap
have
you
been
to
him
he
asked
she
nodded
okoya
continued
i
will
come
again
eager
nods
mingled
with
sobs
and
accompanied
by
rubbing
of
the
eyes
were
her
reply
the
nodding
proved
that
his
call
would
be
very
very
welcome
she
uncovered
her
face
her
eyes
beamed
through
tears
and
she
smiled
as
sincerely
as
she
felt
her
grief
the
announcement
that
he
would
return
as
soon
as
the
was
over
made
her
happy
and
her
features
expressed
it
she
went
her
way
quietly
okoya
following
her
with
his
eyes
he
longed
to
say
to
her
come
with
me
and
let
us
go
together
to
my
mother
she
weeps
so
much
but
it
could
not
be
it
was
useless
to
mention
it
about
his
mother
okoya
felt
deeply
concerned
for
she
did
not
bear
her
grief
as
the
others
bore
theirs
she
was
not
noisy
like
the
rest
utterly
oblivious
of
her
daily
task
she
neither
cooked
nor
baked
nor
cared
for
anything
her
husband
and
children
had
to
go
hungry
while
she
sat
in
a
corner
sobbing
and
weeping
it
was
indeed
a
blessing
for
her
that
she
was
able
to
weep
otherwise
her
reason
might
have
given
way
under
the
terrible
and
crushing
blow
with
the
loss
of
her
father
she
felt
as
if
lost
forever
as
if
her
only
support
her
only
hope
had
gone
the
past
came
back
to
her
not
like
an
ugly
dream
but
as
a
fearful
reality
threatening
sure
destruction
between
her
and
the
accusation
which
she
felt
certain
had
been
fulminated
against
her
before
the
council
there
stood
henceforth
no
one
and
at
the
end
of
the
mourning
she
expected
to
be
dragged
before
the
council
at
once
and
condemned
to
death
and
what
sort
of
death
exposed
to
public
wrath
as
a
witch
bound
and
gagged
tied
to
a
tree
with
the
rough
bark
lacerating
her
breast
and
then
beaten
beaten
to
a
jelly
rib
broken
after
rib
limb
after
limb
until
the
soul
left
the
body
wreck
under
the
curses
of
bystanders
oh
if
she
could
only
die
now
a
swift
an
honourable
death
like
that
of
her
father
if
she
could
only
have
seen
shotaye
she
expected
the
surely
to
come
down
to
cheer
her
up
she
felt
a
longing
for
her
friend
a
desire
to
see
her
to
hear
her
voice
but
day
after
day
ran
on
night
after
night
followed
and
shotaye
did
not
come
it
did
not
surprise
her
that
shotaye
did
not
appear
on
the
first
day
but
on
the
evening
of
the
second
she
began
to
tremble
when
the
night
of
the
third
came
her
apprehensions
became
distressing
on
the
fourth
shotaye
must
surely
come
expectation
and
finally
disappointment
almost
tortured
to
death
the
poor
woman
for
shotaye
came
not
everything
seemed
to
conspire
to
render
her
hopelessly
miserable
she
lost
sight
of
her
surroundings
grew
speechless
and
almost
devoid
of
feeling
the
others
explained
her
state
as
one
of
profound
and
very
natural
grief
and
let
her
alone
but
it
was
uncomfortable
in
the
house
when
the
mistress
took
no
notice
of
anything
and
did
not
even
provide
the
most
necessary
things
not
even
therefore
zashue
as
well
as
okoya
preferred
to
go
out
of
doors
there
to
await
the
termination
of
the
disagreeable
period
of
mourning
at
the
end
of
which
they
confidently
expected
say
to
return
to
her
normal
condition
after
he
had
separated
from
mitsha
okoya
sauntered
without
really
knowing
whither
up
the
gorge
and
down
the
northern
side
of
the
cultivated
plots
he
gradually
neared
the
cliffs
and
found
himself
beyond
the
dwellings
of
the
water
clan
and
therefore
beyond
the
uppermost
caves
that
were
inhabited
the
gorge
narrow
and
covered
mostly
with
underbrush
and
pines
afforded
to
his
sight
but
a
single
conspicuous
object
and
toward
this
he
turned
at
once
to
his
right
lay
some
caves
that
had
been
long
ago
forsaken
and
whose
front
wall
had
partly
crumbled
below
the
short
slope
leading
up
to
them
are
the
traces
of
an
old
round
estufa
a
plain
concavity
in
the
ground
indicates
its
site
at
the
time
when
okoya
strolled
about
the
roofing
alone
was
destroyed
and
part
of
the
interior
was
filled
with
blocks
of
stone
that
had
tumbled
from
the
cliffs
crushing
the
roof
okoya
from
where
he
stood
had
the
interior
of
the
ruin
open
before
him
and
he
saw
in
it
partly
sitting
and
partly
reclining
the
figure
of
his
friend
hayoue
it
was
a
welcome
discovery
he
had
not
met
hayoue
since
the
death
of
his
grandfather
for
the
brother
of
zashue
had
avoided
the
great
house
and
its
inmates
on
purpose
he
mourned
earnestly
and
sincerely
and
wished
to
be
alone
with
his
thoughts
but
okoya
was
not
disposed
to
let
him
alone
he
knew
that
if
his
uncle
spoke
to
any
one
he
would
speak
to
him
and
that
if
he
felt
indisposed
to
enter
into
any
conversation
he
would
say
so
at
once
hayoue
was
very
outspoken
the
boy
jumped
down
from
block
to
block
noisily
for
he
wanted
to
attract
his
uncle
attention
beforehand
the
latter
looked
up
as
soon
as
he
saw
who
the
disturber
of
his
musings
was
he
waved
his
hand
beckoning
him
to
come
okoya
obeyed
with
alacrity
for
he
saw
that
hayoue
felt
disposed
to
talk
throwing
himself
down
beside
him
he
waited
patiently
until
the
other
saw
fit
to
open
the
conversation
they
both
remained
for
a
while
in
silence
until
hayoue
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
said
does
zashue
my
brother
mourn
also
not
as
we
do
replied
okoya
yet
he
is
sad
it
is
well
he
is
right
to
feel
sad
sad
for
himself
for
you
for
all
of
us
sa
umo
was
so
good
whispered
the
boy
and
tears
came
to
him
again
but
he
controlled
his
feelings
and
swallowed
his
sobs
he
did
not
wish
the
other
to
see
him
weep
indeed
sa
umo
maseua
was
good
hayoue
emphasized
better
than
any
of
us
truer
than
any
of
us
none
of
us
at
the
tyuonyi
is
as
strong
and
wise
as
he
was
how
could
the
moshome
kill
him
if
he
was
such
a
great
warrior
okoya
naïvely
inquired
see
satyumishe
he
was
struck
from
behind
in
this
way
a
moshome
may
kill
a
bear
and
so
yai
shruy
destroys
the
strongest
mokatsh
sa
umo
had
no
weapons
neither
bow
nor
arrow
nor
club
he
did
not
suppose
that
there
were
any
moshome
lurking
about
as
tiatui
lies
in
wait
for
the
deer
had
sa
nashtio
gone
south
or
toward
the
west
he
would
have
carried
what
was
right
but
over
there
he
pointed
northward
who
would
have
believed
the
people
over
there
to
be
so
mean
as
these
shuatyam
of
tehuas
now
prove
to
be
destruction
come
upon
them
he
spoke
very
excitedly
his
eyes
flashed
and
he
gnashed
his
teeth
shaking
his
clenched
fist
at
the
north
he
hissed
and
destruction
will
come
upon
them
soon
we
shall
go
to
kapo
and
come
back
with
many
scalps
we
will
not
get
one
only
and
crawl
back
as
shutzuna
does
after
he
has
stolen
a
turkey
we
shall
go
soon
very
soon
okoya
yielded
to
the
excitement
which
the
latter
part
of
his
speech
bespoke
his
eyes
sparkled
also
and
his
chest
heaved
at
the
mention
of
blood
satyumishe
he
exclaimed
let
us
go
i
and
you
together
let
us
go
and
get
what
may
please
our
father
heart
hayoue
looked
at
him
it
was
an
earnest
and
significant
look
you
are
right
brother
you
are
wise
and
you
are
good
you
also
know
how
to
hit
with
an
arrow
but
you
are
not
uakanyi
but
i
shall
be
one
if
i
go
with
you
boldly
uttered
the
boy
his
uncle
shook
his
head
and
smiled
do
you
know
sa
uishe
that
every
one
can
not
go
with
the
warriors
when
they
go
on
the
every
one
can
not
say
am
going
and
then
go
as
he
pleases
and
when
he
pleases
every
one
can
not
think
am
strong
and
wise
and
i
will
follow
the
enemy
if
the
shiuana
do
not
help
him
the
strongest
is
weak
and
the
wisest
is
a
child
before
the
foe
see
satyumishe
i
am
as
good
a
uakanyi
as
any
one
but
i
do
not
know
whether
when
the
hishtanyi
chayan
says
in
the
uuityam
which
men
shall
go
and
take
from
the
tehuas
what
is
proper
i
may
go
with
them
perhaps
i
shall
have
to
stay
and
some
other
one
will
go
in
my
stead
must
not
all
go
okoya
asked
he
was
astonished
every
one
must
go
whom
the
maseua
chooses
with
a
sad
expression
he
added
our
maseua
is
no
more
and
ere
the
hotshanyi
has
spoken
to
the
yaya
and
nashtio
and
said
to
them
and
such
a
one
shall
be
maseua
it
is
the
hishtanyi
chayan
who
decides
who
shall
go
and
who
shall
stay
at
home
his
nephew
comprehended
he
nodded
and
inquired
does
not
the
hishtanyi
chayan
fast
and
do
penance
now
our
nashtio
hayoue
replied
with
an
important
and
mysterious
mien
has
much
work
at
present
do
you
know
what
he
is
working
naïvely
asked
okoya
he
is
with
those
above
the
reply
closed
the
conversation
on
that
subject
okoya
changed
the
topic
asking
satyumishe
you
are
not
much
older
than
i
how
comes
it
that
you
are
uakanyi
already
hayoue
felt
quite
flattered
he
was
indeed
very
young
for
a
war
magician
and
he
felt
not
a
little
pride
on
account
of
it
assuming
a
and
important
air
he
turned
to
his
nephew
with
the
query
when
you
go
out
hunting
what
is
the
first
thing
you
do
i
take
my
bow
and
arrow
and
leave
the
house
readily
answered
the
boy
this
is
not
what
i
ask
for
growled
hayoue
what
kind
of
work
do
you
do
ere
you
rise
to
the
kauash
the
boy
understood
at
last
i
place
the
stone
and
speak
to
those
above
if
before
you
go
hunting
you
do
not
speak
to
them
are
you
lucky
no
okoya
mumbled
he
recalled
the
unlucky
of
some
time
ago
when
he
had
forgotten
to
say
his
prayers
before
starting
of
which
we
have
spoken
in
the
first
chapter
why
have
you
no
luck
hayoue
further
asked
because
the
shiuana
are
not
satisfied
replied
the
other
his
uncle
nodded
are
you
a
hunter
he
asked
not
yet
i
am
only
learning
why
do
you
learn
in
order
to
know
when
you
once
know
what
can
you
do
then
i
can
okoya
was
embarrassed
i
can
make
the
shiuana
help
me
that
is
it
hayoue
exclaimed
if
the
shiuana
do
not
help
you
can
do
nothing
no
matter
how
swift
you
run
how
far
you
see
and
how
sure
your
aim
is
but
of
the
shiuana
there
are
many
as
many
as
grains
of
sand
on
the
shore
of
the
great
river
below
here
and
when
we
do
not
know
them
we
can
not
speak
to
them
and
beg
for
assistance
just
as
there
are
shiuana
who
assist
the
hunter
there
are
those
who
help
us
that
we
may
strike
the
enemy
and
take
away
from
him
what
makes
him
strong
that
it
may
strengthen
us
look
at
tyame
the
nashtio
of
tzitz
hanutsh
he
is
swift
and
strong
but
he
knows
not
how
to
call
to
those
above
and
around
to
help
him
take
the
scalp
of
the
moshome
we
must
be
wise
and
listen
to
what
those
speak
who
know
how
to
address
the
shiuana
and
what
to
give
them
we
must
learn
in
order
to
act
i
have
learned
and
thus
i
have
become
uakanyi
and
he
who
will
soon
be
where
in
time
we
also
shall
find
rest
he
taught
me
many
things
he
was
good
and
wise
very
good
our
father
the
maseua
he
added
sighing
deeply
will
you
help
me
to
learn
and
become
uakanyi
okoya
turned
to
him
now
with
flashing
eyes
i
will
surely
i
will
you
shall
become
one
of
us
but
you
know
brother
that
you
must
be
silent
and
keep
your
tongue
tied
you
must
not
say
to
this
or
that
one
am
learning
i
have
learned
such
and
such
things
for
i
am
going
to
become
uakanyi
okoya
of
course
assented
then
he
asked
i
am
not
uakanyi
and
can
the
hishtanyi
chayan
tell
me
to
go
along
too
with
the
men
to
strike
the
tehuas
certainly
for
there
are
not
many
of
us
and
in
the
zaashtesh
all
must
stand
up
for
each
and
each
for
all
but
when
many
go
on
the
there
are
always
some
of
us
with
them
in
order
that
the
shiuana
be
in
our
favour
do
the
shiuana
help
the
tehuas
also
for
the
tehuas
are
people
like
ourselves
are
they
not
they
are
indeed
zaashtesh
like
the
queres
but
i
do
not
know
how
the
shiuana
feel
toward
them
old
men
who
knew
told
me
that
the
moshome
tehua
prayed
to
those
above
and
around
us
and
that
they
call
them
ohua
whether
they
are
the
same
as
ours
i
can
not
tell
but
i
can
not
believe
them
to
be
for
the
kopishtai
who
dwell
over
there
must
be
good
to
their
people
whereas
the
kopishtai
here
are
good
to
us
only
those
who
hold
in
their
hands
the
paths
of
our
lives
help
those
who
do
right
and
give
them
what
is
due
wherever
and
whoever
they
be
how
soon
shall
we
go
against
the
tehuas
the
yaya
chayan
and
the
uishtyaka
perhaps
alone
know
that
as
soon
as
the
hishtanyi
has
done
his
work
he
will
call
the
uuityam
and
then
those
shall
go
that
must
perhaps
i
may
go
perhaps
not
it
may
be
that
both
of
us
will
be
sent
along
but
we
will
go
soon
he
fiercely
muttered
soon
to
take
from
the
tehuas
what
is
precious
to
the
heart
of
our
father
who
now
goes
toward
shipapu
okoya
felt
wildly
excited
and
could
barely
restrain
himself
thirst
for
revenge
joined
the
intense
wish
to
become
a
warrior
but
hayoue
placed
a
damper
on
his
enthusiasm
else
he
might
have
left
that
night
alone
with
bow
and
arrow
and
a
stone
knife
to
hover
about
the
puye
until
some
luckless
tehua
fell
into
his
hands
he
saw
however
that
nothing
could
be
done
without
the
consent
and
support
of
the
higher
powers
and
that
he
must
curb
his
martial
ardour
and
abide
by
the
decisions
of
those
above
the
present
topic
of
conversation
being
exhausted
both
sat
in
silence
for
a
while
each
following
his
own
train
of
thoughts
okoya
was
the
first
to
speak
again
does
your
hanutsh
mourn
the
women
have
gone
to
weep
with
the
dead
replied
hayoue
i
too
am
mourning
he
added
sorrowfully
but
i
mourn
as
is
becoming
to
a
man
crying
and
weeping
belong
only
to
women
i
have
cried
whispered
okoya
timidly
as
he
looked
at
his
friend
with
a
doubting
glance
he
was
ashamed
of
the
confession
and
yet
could
not
restrain
himself
from
making
it
hayoue
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
are
young
satyumishe
and
your
heart
is
young
it
is
like
the
heart
of
a
girl
when
you
have
seen
many
dead
men
and
many
dying
you
will
do
as
i
do
you
will
not
cry
any
more
he
coughed
and
his
face
twitched
nervously
with
all
his
affectation
of
stoicism
he
had
to
struggle
against
tears
in
order
to
suppress
them
completely
he
spoke
very
loudly
at
once
tzitz
hanutsh
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
dead
and
yet
the
women
lament
and
its
men
think
over
the
loss
that
the
tribe
has
sustained
i
tell
you
okoya
we
have
lost
much
we
are
like
children
without
their
mother
like
a
drove
of
turkeys
whose
gobbler
tiatui
or
mokatsh
have
killed
now
his
eyes
flashed
again
and
he
gnashed
his
teeth
now
tyope
and
the
old
naua
are
uppermost
just
wait
until
the
men
have
returned
from
the
and
you
will
see
evil
is
coming
to
us
did
you
notice
satyumishe
on
the
night
when
they
carried
sa
nashtio
maseua
back
to
the
tyuonyi
how
angry
the
shiuana
were
how
the
lightning
flamed
through
the
clouds
and
killed
the
trees
on
the
mesa
i
tell
you
brother
evil
is
coming
to
our
people
for
a
good
man
has
gone
from
us
to
shipapu
but
the
bad
ones
have
been
spared
okoya
shuddered
involuntarily
he
recollected
well
that
awful
night
never
before
had
a
storm
raged
on
the
rito
with
such
fury
frightful
had
been
the
roar
of
the
thunder
prolonged
like
some
tremendous
subterranean
noise
incessant
lightning
had
for
hours
converted
night
into
day
and
many
were
the
lofty
pines
that
had
been
shattered
or
consumed
by
the
fiery
bolts
from
above
the
wind
which
seldom
does
any
damage
at
such
places
had
swept
through
the
gorge
and
over
the
mesas
with
tremendous
force
and
lastly
the
peaceful
lovely
brook
swollen
by
the
waters
that
gushed
from
the
mountains
in
torrents
as
well
as
by
the
rain
falling
in
sheets
had
waxed
into
a
roaring
turbid
stream
it
had
flooded
the
fields
destroying
crops
and
spreading
masses
of
rocky
débris
over
the
tillable
soil
yes
the
heavens
had
come
upon
the
rito
in
their
full
wrath
as
swift
and
terrible
avengers
both
of
them
remembered
well
that
awful
night
and
dropped
into
moody
silence
at
the
dismal
recollection
are
there
any
other
bad
men
at
the
tyuonyi
okoya
asked
but
low
as
if
he
were
afraid
of
the
answer
there
may
be
others
hayoue
muttered
but
those
two
are
certainly
the
worst
okoya
felt
disappointed
tyope
he
saw
must
indeed
be
a
bad
creature
do
you
know
whether
tyope
is
mourning
asked
his
uncle
i
have
not
seen
him
grumbled
the
other
i
am
sure
he
will
look
as
if
his
mother
had
died
scolded
hayoue
he
is
a
great
liar
worse
than
a
navajo
he
puts
on
a
good
face
and
keeps
the
bad
one
inside
i
would
like
to
know
what
the
shiuana
think
of
that
bad
man
have
we
any
bad
women
among
us
okoya
said
to
change
the
conversation
hannay
is
bad
his
uncle
cried
a
pang
went
through
the
heart
of
the
other
youth
his
prospective
father
and
mother
appeared
really
a
pair
of
exquisite
scoundrels
are
there
any
others
i
do
know
still
i
have
heard
hayoue
looked
about
as
if
afraid
of
some
eavesdropper
what
i
tell
you
now
is
only
for
yourself
that
shotaye
is
bad
very
bad
after
being
tyope
wife
for
a
while
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
does
she
speak
to
those
that
can
do
us
harm
okoya
interrupted
in
a
timid
whisper
it
may
be
there
is
no
doubt
but
she
is
a
harlot
i
know
it
myself
and
every
man
on
the
tyuonyi
knows
it
other
women
are
also
spoken
of
but
nobody
says
it
aloud
it
is
not
right
to
speak
thus
of
people
when
we
do
not
know
positively
i
have
not
seen
shotaye
since
our
father
died
she
is
mourning
perhaps
for
her
cave
is
shut
and
the
deerskin
hangs
over
the
doorway
she
is
likely
to
be
inside
in
quiet
until
the
trouble
is
over
and
the
men
can
go
to
her
again
okoya
rose
to
go
are
you
coming
along
he
asked
his
uncle
hayoue
shook
his
head
he
still
wished
to
remain
alone
it
may
be
he
said
that
we
shall
have
to
leave
in
two
days
against
the
tehuas
and
i
shall
remain
so
that
i
may
be
ready
when
the
tapop
calls
upon
us
you
rely
upon
it
satyumishe
we
shall
go
soon
and
when
it
so
happens
that
we
both
must
go
you
shall
come
with
me
that
i
may
teach
you
how
the
scalp
is
taken
thus
dismissed
okoya
sauntered
back
down
the
valley
when
opposite
the
caves
of
the
water
clan
he
furtively
glanced
over
to
the
one
inhabited
by
shotaye
the
deerskin
as
hayoue
had
stated
hung
over
the
opening
and
no
smoke
issued
from
the
hole
that
served
as
vent
and
the
woman
must
be
mourning
very
deeply
or
else
she
was
gone
she
did
not
often
enter
his
thoughts
and
yet
he
wished
shotaye
might
come
now
and
see
his
mother
he
was
convinced
without
knowing
why
that
his
mother
would
have
been
glad
to
see
her
at
all
events
the
dismal
period
of
mourning
was
drawing
rapidly
to
a
close
and
with
it
official
sadness
would
vanish
he
could
hardly
await
the
morrow
on
that
day
he
hoped
that
the
question
would
be
decided
when
the
great
work
of
revenge
should
commence
and
whether
he
would
be
permitted
to
take
part
in
it
the
words
of
his
uncle
had
opened
an
entirely
new
perspective
to
okoya
to
become
uakanyi
was
now
his
aim
his
intense
ambition
as
warrior
and
as
successful
warrior
he
confidently
expected
that
no
one
would
dare
refuse
him
mitsha
this
hope
overcame
the
grief
he
had
harboured
during
the
days
that
elapsed
for
that
grief
belonged
to
the
past
and
as
the
past
now
appeared
to
him
it
seemed
only
a
to
a
proud
and
happy
future

to
the
nature
of
the
country
and
soil
there
is
comparatively
little
soil
at
the
rito
the
mourning
ceremonies
i
have
witnessed
myself
chapter
xvii
okoya
had
been
correct
in
his
surmise
that
shotaye
was
gone
in
vain
say
koitza
pined
her
friend
had
left
never
to
return
when
the
news
of
topanashka
death
reached
her
which
it
did
on
the
very
night
of
the
occurrence
she
saw
at
a
glance
that
henceforth
her
presence
among
the
queres
was
an
impossibility
for
she
knew
that
the
deceased
was
the
only
one
who
could
interpose
himself
between
say
koitza
and
her
enemies
and
thus
wield
an
influence
indirectly
favourable
to
herself
she
recognized
that
henceforth
tyope
was
free
to
act
as
he
pleased
in
the
matter
for
the
would
be
on
his
side
and
she
saw
that
the
days
of
mourning
that
were
sure
to
follow
afforded
her
a
capital
opportunity
for
leaving
the
rito
unobserved
and
executing
her
flight
to
the
tehuas
of
the
puye
shotaye
could
not
believe
that
cayamo
was
the
slayer
of
topanashka
her
warrior
from
the
north
was
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
pursuing
navajos
he
was
too
anxious
to
save
the
scalp
he
had
taken
even
in
case
topanashka
had
overtaken
him
which
seemed
impossible
the
tehua
would
have
avoided
rather
than
attacked
the
unarmed
old
man
and
if
the
maseua
surprised
their
interview
and
followed
her
knight
the
latter
had
too
much
to
be
ever
overtaken
by
his
aged
and
unarmed
pursuer
the
fact
that
the
sandal
had
been
found
shotaye
interpreted
as
evidence
of
cayamo
precipitate
flight
from
her
standpoint
she
reached
the
very
correct
conclusion
that
the
navajos
who
followed
in
cayamo
tracks
and
not
the
tehua
must
have
killed
the
father
of
her
friend
say
but
she
saw
that
her
people
would
fall
into
error
as
to
the
manner
of
topanashka
death
she
saw
that
they
could
not
have
reached
a
different
conclusion
and
also
that
the
error
must
call
forth
extraordinary
measures
of
revenge
she
heard
enough
and
saw
enough
during
the
commotion
prevailing
at
the
rito
when
the
dead
body
was
brought
in
to
become
convinced
that
as
soon
as
the
mourning
ceremonies
were
over
the
queres
would
take
the
against
the
supposed
murderers
of
their
she
took
care
not
to
disabuse
the
minds
of
any
of
her
tribal
brethren
and
said
nothing
but
felt
glad
at
the
opportunity
which
the
proposed
campaign
would
give
her
for
revenge
flight
to
the
tehuas
was
not
only
very
easy
it
could
be
executed
under
circumstances
that
would
give
her
among
the
other
tribe
a
position
of
considerable
importance
it
was
almost
needless
to
avail
herself
of
the
understanding
with
cayamo
she
had
far
more
important
things
to
communicate
by
informing
the
tehuas
of
the
movement
on
foot
against
them
she
appeared
as
a
deserter
from
the
enemy
as
a
timely
friend
if
afterward
as
she
confidently
believed
tyope
should
come
up
with
the
warriors
against
the
tehuas
he
would
find
everything
prepared
for
a
disastrous
reception
matters
looked
exceedingly
promising
for
her
plans
for
all
that
she
did
not
forget
say
koitza
but
she
had
been
to
some
extent
forewarned
and
as
soon
as
say
heard
of
shotaye
absence
she
must
suspect
the
truth
after
all
say
was
in
no
real
danger
until
the
campaign
was
over
there
was
no
time
to
think
of
her
case
and
during
that
campaign
shotaye
would
provide
for
the
queres
such
a
rough
handling
that
no
thoughts
of
witchcraft
trials
would
trouble
them
for
some
time
to
come
for
there
should
be
mourning
sadness
grief
howling
and
gnashing
of
teeth
on
the
rito
on
a
very
large
scale
still
she
did
not
lose
sight
of
the
possibility
that
her
absence
might
be
noticed
at
an
early
day
and
might
arouse
suspicion
it
was
possible
though
not
at
all
likely
as
long
as
people
mourned
nobody
would
care
for
her
after
the
official
mourning
was
over
the
council
would
be
convened
and
the
campaign
announced
thereupon
all
the
men
who
had
to
take
part
would
have
to
retire
for
the
customary
fasts
and
purifications
and
the
yaya
and
the
chayani
would
have
to
work
heavily
her
home
was
not
likely
to
be
visited
by
any
one
for
a
number
of
days
and
when
the
warriors
of
the
queres
were
on
the
march
nobody
would
call
them
back
because
she
had
disappeared
from
the
rito
perfectly
at
rest
in
regard
to
her
own
future
reassured
as
to
the
fate
of
say
koitza
shotaye
had
on
the
night
of
the
second
day
after
the
murder
of
topanashka
left
her
home
and
climbed
to
the
northern
mesa
without
meeting
any
obstacle
when
the
sun
rose
she
found
herself
quite
near
the
place
which
cayamo
as
far
as
she
understood
had
designated
as
the
spot
where
his
friend
teanyi
would
wait
for
her
unacquainted
with
the
real
distance
that
separates
the
rito
from
the
above
santa
clara
she
had
underrated
it
and
it
was
only
at
noon
after
she
had
spent
hours
walking
through
the
pine
timber
and
in
fruitless
waiting
that
a
man
stepped
up
to
her
from
behind
a
tree
and
called
out
teanyi
then
he
added
cayamo
and
inquired
shotaye
he
was
the
and
delegate
and
when
the
sun
stood
at
its
height
the
two
were
travelling
toward
the
puye
together
shotaye
attempted
to
convey
the
idea
to
her
companion
that
the
queres
were
upon
the
point
of
moving
upon
the
tehuas
in
force
her
excited
gesticulations
and
broken
sentences
only
succeeded
in
making
him
believe
that
she
was
herself
the
object
of
lively
pursuit
by
a
considerable
number
of
men
therefore
when
the
pair
reached
the
isolated
rock
called
puye
which
dominates
the
country
far
around
and
along
the
base
of
which
the
dwellings
of
the
tehuas
were
excavated
in
friable
white
in
the
same
manner
as
are
those
of
the
rito
teanyi
left
her
standing
before
the
entrance
to
his
own
went
in
and
called
his
wife
to
take
care
of
the
while
he
ran
to
the
tuyo
as
the
governor
is
called
among
the
tehuas
the
wife
of
teanyi
had
not
been
informed
of
the
nature
of
shotaye
call
and
as
she
took
her
into
her
quarters
she
eyed
her
curiously
and
suspiciously
for
it
was
probably
the
first
time
she
had
seen
a
human
being
that
spoke
a
language
different
from
her
own
she
gave
her
no
food
but
waited
her
return
shotaye
on
her
side
cast
the
quick
glance
of
her
lively
eyes
at
everything
from
time
to
time
she
attempted
a
word
of
conversation
she
smiled
and
gesticulated
but
the
only
response
was
a
shaking
of
the
head
and
facial
expressions
that
denoted
suspicion
rather
than
friendship
teanyi
had
informed
the
tuyo
that
he
had
met
a
woman
from
the
rito
de
los
frijoles
and
had
taken
her
to
his
home
or
rather
to
that
of
his
wife
that
the
woman
was
gesticulating
in
an
unintelligible
manner
and
that
all
he
could
surmise
was
that
there
might
be
queres
approaching
the
puye
with
hostile
intentions
he
said
nothing
about
cayamo
and
his
relations
toward
shotaye
for
cayamo
had
enjoined
absolute
secrecy
the
governor
of
the
tehuas
was
a
different
man
from
the
pompous
little
tapop
of
the
queres
the
latter
would
at
once
have
called
the
council
and
done
everything
to
surround
the
event
and
his
own
person
with
as
much
noise
as
possible
not
so
the
tuyo
of
the
puye
he
only
said
i
will
go
with
you
and
went
to
the
room
of
teanyi
wife
to
see
shotaye
and
investigate
for
himself
the
gesticulations
began
again
and
the
woman
used
every
effort
to
make
herself
understood
the
governor
did
his
best
to
understand
her
but
no
progress
was
made
toward
comprehension
she
even
followed
precedent
in
drawing
a
line
on
the
floor
from
north
to
south
designating
the
southern
end
as
tupoge
the
northern
end
as
puye
for
thus
much
she
had
kept
in
memory
then
she
pointed
out
on
that
line
the
spot
where
topanashka
had
been
killed
and
said
uan
save
and
made
the
for
killing
lastly
she
tried
to
convey
the
idea
that
the
queres
were
in
arms
against
the
tehuas
the
governor
displayed
much
coolness
and
paid
close
attention
during
this
strange
and
almost
comic
interview
he
thought
he
understood
that
a
man
from
the
rito
probably
called
topanashka
had
been
murdered
by
the
dinnes
on
the
trail
leading
to
the
puye
from
the
south
he
also
thought
that
the
queres
were
on
the
to
avenge
the
murder
in
what
manner
this
was
connected
with
the
excited
state
of
the
woman
he
could
not
clearly
see
unless
she
was
perhaps
the
widow
of
the
murdered
man
in
that
event
she
might
have
become
insane
from
fright
and
despair
her
violent
gesticulations
and
the
expression
of
passion
and
agitation
on
her
features
confirmed
his
suspicion
that
shotaye
was
distracted
a
growing
coldness
in
his
manner
at
last
showed
the
woman
what
sort
of
an
impression
she
had
been
creating
and
she
felt
very
uneasy
not
that
her
life
became
endangered
thereby
on
the
contrary
the
indian
is
very
considerate
and
charitable
toward
such
unfortunates
but
from
the
moment
that
the
tehuas
were
convinced
of
her
insanity
they
would
attach
no
longer
any
importance
to
her
warnings
and
a
precious
lapse
of
time
that
should
be
improved
for
immediate
preparations
for
defence
was
irretrievably
lost
the
queres
might
be
allowed
to
approach
and
their
onslaught
would
find
the
tehuas
utterly
unprepared
if
only
cayamo
had
been
present
but
he
dared
not
approach
a
woman
now
for
he
was
at
work
purifying
himself
and
fasting
in
anticipation
of
the
great
day
when
the
scalp
which
he
had
taken
would
be
feasted
over
danced
over
prayed
at
and
sung
to
shotaye
found
herself
in
a
most
painful
situation
she
noticed
how
complacently
the
tuyo
smiled
the
more
she
attempted
to
insist
at
last
he
turned
to
teanyi
and
said
a
few
words
to
the
latter
teanyi
shook
his
head
and
shotaye
followed
the
discussion
that
ensued
between
the
two
men
with
eager
eyes
and
ears
it
soon
became
clear
to
her
that
they
were
of
different
opinions
and
that
each
one
persisted
in
his
own
finally
teanyi
spoke
alone
and
for
quite
a
while
in
a
low
voice
and
the
governor
listened
attentively
and
with
growing
interest
though
teanyi
voice
was
muffled
shotaye
still
overheard
the
word
cayamo
several
times
straining
her
sense
of
hearing
she
caught
the
words
tupoge
tema
quio
finally
shotaye
also
the
tuyo
listened
smiled
winked
slyly
and
at
last
laughed
aloud
at
the
same
time
he
turned
his
face
to
her
and
nodded
most
pleasantly
thereupon
he
said
a
few
words
to
teanyi
aloud
and
the
latter
turned
to
his
family
which
had
little
by
little
congregated
in
the
room
and
repeated
as
appeared
to
shotaye
his
statements
at
the
close
of
his
talk
all
broke
out
in
a
joyful
laugh
the
housewife
who
until
then
had
rather
frowned
at
the
visitor
now
smiled
and
nodded
too
repeating
the
words
not
queres
tehua
woman
wife
of
cayamo
all
laughed
and
the
governor
exclaimed
it
is
well
the
case
was
clear
to
all
cayamo
on
his
expedition
to
secure
scalps
had
picked
up
a
sweetheart
food
was
placed
before
shotaye
and
the
woman
caressed
her
inviting
her
to
eat
in
the
mean
time
one
of
the
boys
had
left
the
room
shotaye
was
still
eating
when
he
returned
in
company
with
an
elderly
man
of
low
stature
whose
greeting
was
answered
with
the
usual
reply
this
man
cowered
down
among
the
rest
and
listened
with
the
closest
attention
to
a
long
speech
of
the
governor
at
the
close
of
it
he
sat
for
a
while
scrutinizing
the
woman
appearance
but
when
she
looked
up
at
him
he
addressed
her
in
her
own
dialect
and
with
the
words
where
do
you
come
from
a
heavy
load
fell
from
shotaye
heart
the
ice
was
broken
henceforth
she
could
explain
herself
in
her
own
tongue
and
inform
the
tehuas
of
everything
that
was
so
important
to
them
so
momentous
to
her
but
her
first
impression
on
hearing
her
tongue
spoken
by
one
who
was
certainly
not
of
her
stock
was
almost
one
of
fright
people
who
spoke
more
than
one
language
were
excessively
rare
at
those
times
and
those
who
happened
to
learn
the
speech
of
another
tribe
kept
it
secret
as
tyope
for
instance
concealed
his
knowledge
of
the
navajo
language
from
the
people
of
the
rito
the
knowledge
of
more
than
one
tongue
was
a
suspicious
and
therefore
a
dangerous
gift
the
man
who
now
conversed
with
shotaye
in
the
queres
dialect
was
not
a
native
of
the
puye
he
belonged
to
the
linguistic
group
of
the
tehuas
but
to
the
southern
branch
the
tanos
who
inhabited
several
villages
west
of
the
rio
grande
and
in
the
country
where
the
city
of
santa
fé
now
stands
between
the
tanos
and
the
queres
there
was
limited
commercial
intercourse
for
the
tanos
claimed
the
veins
of
turquoise
that
abound
on
the
heights
near
some
of
their
villages
and
the
queres
went
thither
at
rare
intervals
to
trade
for
the
gems
which
they
were
unable
to
obtain
by
force
through
this
rare
and
limited
traffic
the
tano
had
become
acquainted
with
some
of
the
men
of
the
rito
and
many
years
ago
had
even
accompanied
them
to
their
home
in
the
mountain
gorge
such
visits
were
literally
great
affairs
at
the
time
and
they
lasted
long
extensive
formalities
were
required
to
ascertain
first
how
far
the
shiuana
appeared
favourable
to
the
and
how
he
should
make
himself
understood
to
them
the
had
to
make
strenuous
efforts
in
behalf
of
the
visitor
equally
long
formalities
preceded
his
departure
and
our
tano
had
in
this
manner
between
reception
residence
and
spent
more
than
a
year
at
the
rito
de
los
frijoles
during
that
time
he
had
acquired
a
knowledge
of
the
queres
language
and
spoke
it
therefore
not
fluently
but
still
intelligibly
as
shotaye
had
appeared
excited
and
agitated
as
long
as
she
felt
helpless
in
matters
of
speech
so
now
she
became
free
easy
and
above
all
calm
and
clear
in
her
utterances
when
she
could
make
herself
understood
the
tano
began
to
question
her
in
a
methodical
and
even
in
an
argumentative
manner
he
spoke
slowly
and
brokenly
but
she
understood
him
and
he
comprehended
fully
her
replies
for
they
were
given
to
the
same
categoric
way
each
of
her
sentences
he
translated
into
tehua
turning
to
the
tuyo
at
the
end
of
every
one
of
her
answers
shotaye
told
him
everything
with
the
exception
of
the
matter
of
the
owl
feathers
for
these
would
have
been
as
dangerous
among
the
tehuas
as
among
the
queres
she
explained
the
misunderstanding
that
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
hostility
displayed
by
the
queres
and
finally
she
insisted
that
there
was
no
time
to
clear
up
that
misunderstanding
and
since
the
queres
were
already
on
the
march
she
urged
speedy
preparation
to
repel
the
assault
she
strained
the
truth
on
the
latter
point
but
the
tuyo
forgave
her
this
manifest
exaggeration
he
knew
that
there
must
be
at
least
five
days
delay
before
the
prospective
campaign
the
further
the
woman
proceeded
in
her
exposition
of
facts
the
more
she
observed
through
her
quick
and
scrutinizing
glance
that
her
listeners
became
deeply
interested
and
that
thoroughly
startled
they
at
last
displayed
marks
of
indignation
that
indignation
it
was
plain
was
against
the
queres
and
shotaye
felt
that
she
had
gained
her
point
the
breach
between
the
tribes
was
now
widened
to
such
an
extent
that
it
could
never
be
healed
at
the
close
of
the
interrogatory
which
had
frequently
been
interrupted
by
exclamations
of
surprise
and
anger
the
mistress
of
the
house
caressed
shotaye
calling
her
sister
the
tuyo
however
merely
nodded
to
her
kindly
uttered
in
a
commanding
tone
a
few
words
to
those
present
and
went
out
to
attend
to
his
duties
of
convening
the
council
but
the
tano
indian
remained
with
shotaye
until
late
in
the
night
he
pretended
to
keep
her
company
and
to
contribute
toward
dispelling
the
feeling
of
loneliness
that
might
overcome
her
in
the
midst
of
people
with
whom
she
could
not
converse
but
in
reality
he
remained
as
a
spy
to
in
a
covert
way
shotaye
was
wary
and
not
one
contradiction
not
one
misstatement
could
he
detect
during
their
talk
then
he
went
where
the
council
had
gathered
reporting
that
according
to
his
conviction
the
woman
was
not
only
sincere
but
exceedingly
it
would
be
superfluous
to
enter
into
details
concerning
the
proceedings
of
the
council
its
composition
and
the
formalities
were
in
the
main
similar
to
those
of
the
council
of
the
queres
one
point
was
earnestly
discussed
the
propriety
of
sending
a
messenger
to
the
queres
to
clear
up
if
possible
the
misunderstanding
but
the
thought
was
finally
discarded
on
the
ground
that
it
was
not
the
tehuas
who
should
make
overtures
of
peace
because
they
were
absolutely
innocent
but
the
queres
for
it
was
they
who
ere
proceeding
to
hostile
demonstrations
should
have
called
on
the
tehuas
for
explanation
had
the
two
tribes
been
on
friendly
terms
it
might
have
been
different
but
there
existed
a
breach
between
them
already
and
if
the
queres
chose
to
still
further
widen
it
the
tehuas
felt
ready
for
any
emergency
it
was
resolved
to
prepare
for
war
at
once
to
call
to
arms
the
entire
male
population
send
ahead
the
necessary
spies
and
thus
prepared
to
wait
with
this
the
matter
went
into
the
hands
of
the
great
and
the
head
the
former
was
almost
an
equivalent
to
the
hishtanyi
chayan
among
the
queres
the
latter
the
exact
equivalent
of
the
maseua
the
rock
of
the
puye
along
whose
base
the
numerous
are
burrowed
out
of
a
very
friable
and
almost
tufa
is
situated
about
ten
miles
west
of
the
rio
grande
and
not
two
miles
south
of
the
picturesque
cañon
of
santa
clara
the
cliff
is
over
one
half
mile
long
and
it
dominates
the
mesa
on
which
it
stands
for
many
miles
there
are
groves
of
timber
surrounding
the
foot
of
the
high
and
rugged
slope
that
leads
up
to
the
while
the
queres
at
the
rito
dwelt
at
the
bottom
of
a
secluded
gorge
the
tehuas
occupied
a
picturesque
citadel
rising
from
a
high
and
level
plateau
northeast
of
the
puye
and
separated
from
it
by
the
cañon
of
santa
clara
there
rises
a
similar
rock
equally
bold
and
striking
and
higher
still
but
not
as
extensive
this
is
called
by
the
tehuas
shu
finne
its
lower
rim
is
also
perforated
by
and
these
were
inhabited
by
a
portion
of
the
same
tribe
during
the
night
runners
were
sent
to
the
shu
finne
calling
upon
its
people
for
assistance
and
videttes
were
placed
on
the
mountains
and
on
the
little
mesa
capping
the
cliff
the
tehuas
were
more
numerous
than
the
queres
of
the
rito
and
might
well
wait
calmly
and
with
dignity
until
the
latter
either
sought
to
negotiate
or
broke
out
in
unjustifiable
warfare
the
five
days
which
as
the
tuyo
had
correctly
inferred
would
be
spent
by
the
people
of
the
tyuonyi
in
mourning
and
in
warlike
preparations
passed
and
no
messenger
of
peace
came
to
the
tehuas
the
queres
remained
in
perfect
confidence
that
those
whom
they
intended
to
surprise
were
in
absolute
ignorance
of
any
evil
intentions
on
their
part
but
when
the
night
of
the
fifth
day
had
shrouded
the
landscape
in
purple
darkness
tehua
warriors
began
to
stream
down
the
slopes
from
the
cliff
and
its
the
deepest
silence
was
observed
instructions
having
been
given
beforehand
and
the
bands
of
armed
men
moved
noiselessly
forward
the
plan
was
not
to
await
the
attack
at
home
but
to
advance
into
the
more
timbered
country
south
of
the
barren
mesa
where
the
cliff
rises
and
to
surprise
the
enemy
on
their
approach
from
reports
of
spies
it
was
known
that
no
queres
were
as
yet
scouring
the
heights
north
of
the
rito
and
the
tehuas
moving
swiftly
were
able
to
place
themselves
in
ambush
in
the
rocky
wilderness
where
later
on
their
descendants
built
and
inhabited
the
now
ruined
village
of
the
pueblo
of
the
bird
one
half
day
journey
would
bring
the
queres
easily
to
that
point
where
they
certainly
would
not
expect
to
be
met
by
armed
foes
there
is
water
in
the
vicinity
and
the
ground
is
broken
with
pine
groves
it
could
be
foretold
with
reasonable
certainty
that
the
enemy
would
move
in
the
direction
of
this
place
for
it
is
the
straightest
course
though
not
the
easiest
from
the
rito
northward
in
this
region
the
tehua
hosts
spread
out
scouts
preceding
even
as
far
as
the
ziro
kauash
the
queres
might
come
for
everything
was
as
ready
as
shotaye
fondest
hopes
could
have
wished
during
these
warlike
preparations
shotaye
found
ample
time
and
opportunity
to
become
initiated
into
the
life
of
her
new
home
the
old
interpreter
proved
a
very
useful
guide
and
she
improved
his
willingness
to
talk
and
to
advise
he
informed
her
that
cayamo
was
free
and
that
as
soon
as
the
story
of
their
meeting
had
become
known
among
the
people
of
the
puye
everybody
began
to
look
upon
her
as
his
future
wife
shortly
before
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
the
time
of
his
retirement
expired
the
ceremonies
on
the
scalp
matter
had
to
be
postponed
on
account
of
the
measures
of
war
and
cayamo
was
able
to
present
himself
to
his
future
spouse
in
the
natural
colour
of
his
skin
and
in
his
usual
costume
their
meeting
was
not
in
the
least
sentimental
both
laughed
aloud
and
joyfully
they
exchanged
gestures
and
signs
plainly
indicating
their
future
duties
and
probable
results
those
present
laughed
in
token
of
approval
and
applause
at
a
hint
from
teanyi
wife
shotaye
placed
some
before
cayamo
he
ate
a
few
morsels
the
courtship
formalities
were
fulfilled
and
the
bridegroom
returned
to
his
duty
as
a
warrior
the
tano
had
informed
the
woman
that
cayamo
belonged
to
the
clan
of
the
sun
in
return
she
communicated
that
the
water
people
were
her
kindred
what
the
queres
called
tzitz
hanutsh
the
tehuas
named
doa
and
the
members
of
the
clan
were
therefore
officially
requested
to
take
their
new
sister
in
charge
some
of
the
old
men
of
the
cluster
came
over
to
the
dwellings
of
the
turquoise
clan
where
the
wife
of
teanyi
lived
in
their
company
came
several
women
who
escorted
shotaye
to
her
new
quarters
on
the
way
to
the
caves
of
doa
one
of
the
women
lightly
touched
shotaye
breast
then
her
own
and
whispered
oyike
it
was
her
name
and
shotaye
communicated
her
own
in
reply
the
woman
shook
her
head
whispering
nyo
shotaye
nyo
tema
shotaye
not
queres
tehua
quio
then
she
grasped
her
hand
and
breathed
into
shotaye
ear
aua
quio
shotaye
easily
understood
the
meaning
of
this
confidential
communication
with
her
change
of
abode
her
name
was
to
change
also
henceforth
she
was
to
be
a
tehua
woman
and
aua
quio
was
to
be
her
name
the
tano
continued
his
visits
as
heretofore
he
plied
the
woman
with
questions
sometimes
of
the
most
complex
nature
his
conduct
in
this
respect
was
characteristic
of
the
suspicious
nature
of
the
indian
generally
the
leaders
of
the
tehuas
mistrusted
shotaye
still
notwithstanding
her
clear
and
positive
talk
and
they
had
instructed
the
tano
to
keep
her
company
and
to
probe
her
sincerity
and
veracity
still
further
but
she
was
more
than
a
match
for
all
of
them
she
saw
through
the
maze
of
the
very
confused
and
bewildering
interrogatory
and
her
replies
were
such
as
to
absolutely
confirm
the
tehuas
in
the
good
opinion
they
had
conceived
of
her
whatever
the
interpreter
reported
to
the
tuyo
that
was
of
any
value
to
the
military
operations
impending
was
immediately
communicated
to
the
through
a
special
runner
for
that
functionary
was
in
the
field
already
with
his
men
shotaye
made
use
of
her
conversations
with
the
tano
indian
to
direct
the
attention
of
the
tehuas
toward
tyope
she
described
him
as
the
leading
warrior
and
the
most
influential
man
on
the
rito
as
the
pivot
around
which
everything
revolved
and
on
whose
life
much
would
depend
but
she
was
artful
enough
not
to
depict
tyope
as
a
bad
man
lest
the
tehuas
might
infer
her
real
purpose
she
spoke
of
him
as
a
man
dangerous
through
his
good
qualities
and
as
a
formidable
adversary
in
short
her
words
produced
such
an
effect
that
the
governor
himself
came
to
interrogate
her
on
the
subject
and
even
caused
the
to
return
from
the
field
on
the
fourth
day
and
had
him
visit
shotaye
in
company
with
the
interpreter
and
secure
a
detailed
and
accurate
description
of
this
dangerous
individual
then
they
went
to
the
and
consulted
him
about
the
propriety
of
taking
shotaye
along
into
the
field
that
she
might
point
out
the
great
warrior
who
so
they
had
become
convinced
must
be
killed
at
all
hazards
in
order
to
insure
success
on
the
evening
of
the
sixth
day
therefore
shotaye
wandered
over
to
tzirege
in
company
with
the
commander
himself
shortly
after
their
arrival
among
the
group
of
warriors
where
the
had
taken
his
position
runners
came
from
the
south
with
news
that
they
had
detected
several
queres
in
full
creeping
northward
from
the
brink
of
the
rito
these
runners
were
at
once
ordered
back
with
strict
injunctions
to
the
scouts
not
to
impede
the
movements
but
to
suffer
them
to
advance
the
tehuas
were
quite
scattered
particularly
in
the
front
as
is
usually
the
case
with
bodies
of
indians
on
the
the
main
bodies
concealed
themselves
between
the
tzirege
and
a
deep
and
broad
ravine
farther
south
called
cañada
ancha
they
kept
in
the
woods
toward
the
mountains
expecting
their
foes
to
approach
on
a
line
closer
to
the
river
the
plan
was
to
allow
the
queres
to
come
up
undisturbed
as
far
as
the
north
side
of
the
cañada
as
the
men
from
the
rito
advanced
the
tehua
scouts
were
to
close
in
from
the
rear
and
follow
them
cautiously
until
the
enemies
were
all
gathered
on
the
desired
spot
with
the
woods
to
their
left
and
rugged
barren
cliffs
and
peaks
to
their
right
then
the
trap
would
be
sprung
and
if
the
queres
took
to
those
bleak
fastnesses
for
defence
it
would
be
easy
to
surround
them
cut
them
off
from
water
and
thus
exterminate
them
completely
night
had
fallen
when
another
message
came
to
the
effect
that
the
numbers
of
the
enemy
were
increasing
and
beginning
to
spread
over
the
timber
in
small
groups
the
sent
a
messenger
to
the
puye
and
after
midnight
the
great
of
war
appeared
in
person
the
shaman
was
like
all
the
others
painted
black
a
tall
plume
taken
from
an
eagle
rose
behind
each
ear
the
left
hand
carried
a
rattle
and
a
little
drum
was
suspended
from
his
shoulder
as
soon
as
he
arrived
one
of
the
warriors
retired
to
a
spot
which
was
almost
hedged
in
by
several
bushy
there
he
built
a
fire
and
as
soon
as
it
burned
he
covered
it
in
such
a
manner
that
only
a
thin
film
of
smoke
arose
from
it
to
this
smouldering
heap
the
shaman
proceeded
alone
and
sat
down
there
he
spent
the
night
muttering
incantations
and
prayers
shaking
his
rattle
and
striking
the
drum
softly
from
time
to
time
the
sounds
that
proceeded
from
his
discordant
music
were
so
faint
that
they
could
be
heard
only
in
close
proximity
they
were
besides
the
only
human
sound
in
this
wilderness
animal
voices
occasionally
disturbed
the
quietness
of
the
night
nobody
would
have
supposed
that
between
the
rito
and
the
mesas
opposite
san
ildefonso
of
several
hundred
indian
warriors
were
hidden
patiently
waiting
or
slowly
moving
forward
it
was
a
quiet
still
night
cool
as
the
nights
mostly
are
in
the
rainy
season
and
dark
the
sky
was
partly
overcast
but
the
clouds
did
not
drift
they
formed
and
dissolved
overhead
and
the
stars
appeared
and
disappeared
alternately
as
the
nebulous
fleeces
disclosed
or
shrouded
them
behind
the
mountain
thunderclouds
rested
and
occasional
flashes
of
lightning
illuminated
the
crests
and
faint
thunder
muttered
in
the
distance
it
had
no
threatening
sound
and
the
lightning
did
not
seem
like
prophetic
writing
on
the
sombre
clouds
it
was
a
pleasant
night
and
an
excellent
one
for
indian
warfare
the
scouts
of
the
tehuas
had
reported
in
the
last
instance
that
the
bulk
of
the
from
the
rito
must
now
be
on
the
move
for
no
fresh
additions
were
coming
up
from
the
gorge
so
careless
and
unconcerned
were
the
queres
so
absolutely
sure
of
the
enemy
ignorance
of
their
designs
that
they
never
thought
of
sending
scouts
to
the
upper
end
of
the
northern
mesa
from
there
a
few
tehuas
had
comfortably
observed
everything
that
happened
in
the
gorge
during
the
day
and
as
evening
came
they
could
report
even
the
numbers
of
the
warriors
who
took
part
in
the
campaign
as
soon
as
these
warriors
were
all
on
the
ziro
kauash
the
tehua
spies
after
warning
those
behind
them
crept
cautiously
into
the
rear
of
the
advancing
foe
all
the
men
from
the
tyuonyi
had
not
been
permitted
to
join
the
expedition
hayoue
was
not
among
them
neither
was
okoya
it
was
a
sad
disappointment
to
the
boy
and
yet
was
he
not
staying
at
home
in
defence
of
his
mother
and
of
mitsha
say
koitza
had
ceased
to
weep
but
the
persistent
neglect
which
she
thought
she
suffered
from
shotaye
grieved
her
at
last
she
asked
okoya
whether
he
had
seen
anything
of
the
his
reply
that
he
thought
she
had
gone
explained
everything
she
recollected
the
confident
words
that
shotaye
had
spoken
to
her
and
concluded
that
the
woman
had
carried
out
her
plan
of
taking
refuge
with
the
tehuas
that
quelled
her
apprehensions
and
allayed
her
fears
shotaye
knew
what
she
was
and
had
to
do
and
shotaye
of
this
say
felt
convinced
was
true
to
her
in
order
to
be
quite
sure
of
the
fact
however
she
strolled
up
to
the
cave
in
the
course
of
an
afternoon
the
rooms
were
empty
and
say
turned
back
one
of
shotaye
neighbours
stopped
her
to
ask
where
the
might
be
say
carelessly
replied
that
she
was
probably
on
the
heights
above
gathering
herbs
the
wily
fugitive
had
left
her
household
as
if
she
were
about
to
return
soon
with
the
exception
of
the
mother
of
okoya
nobody
noticed
her
absence
she
was
known
to
disappear
occasionally
for
several
days
and
furthermore
the
excitement
and
bustle
incident
upon
the
prospective
expedition
against
the
tehuas
engaged
everybody
attention
say
koitza
could
not
help
wondering
whether
shotaye
would
inform
the
tehuas
of
the
impending
attack
perhaps
she
might
perhaps
not
at
all
events
she
felt
relieved
upon
hearing
that
neither
her
son
nor
her
husband
nor
even
hayoue
were
to
go
with
the
warriors
the
enterprise
aroused
within
her
vague
apprehensions
why
she
could
not
tell
but
it
pleased
her
to
learn
that
tyope
was
going
going
as
the
leader
the
of
the
party
illustration
rito
de
los
frijoles
looking
out
from
the
ceremonial
cave
tyope
had
worked
incessantly
and
with
brilliant
results
the
shkuy
chayan
and
the
koshare
naua
had
succeeded
in
so
inveigling
the
principal
shaman
that
he
ordered
that
all
the
men
from
the
water
clan
and
those
from
shyuamo
with
few
exceptions
should
stay
at
home
for
the
protection
of
the
women
and
children
that
included
hayoue
of
whose
abilities
and
popularity
tyope
was
afraid
and
saved
the
turquoise
people
from
the
casualties
of
war
tyope
went
so
far
as
to
praise
hayoue
in
the
council
suggesting
that
the
young
man
should
be
intrusted
with
authority
as
the
suggestion
was
carried
out
at
once
and
afterward
the
hishtanyi
chayan
appointed
tyope
as
of
the
forces
marching
out
he
himself
accompanied
the
body
of
warriors
as
adviser
and
spiritual
guide
to
the
captain
nothing
could
suit
tyope
better
the
man
was
old
and
not
very
strong
and
people
are
often
killed
in
war
after
sunset
the
made
his
appearance
on
the
northern
mesa
and
performed
his
incantations
tyope
and
most
of
the
others
breathed
on
their
and
then
group
after
group
stealthily
moved
onward
the
plan
which
had
been
communicated
to
every
one
in
its
main
points
consisted
in
reaching
before
sunrise
the
very
ground
which
the
tehuas
had
selected
for
their
operations
passing
the
following
day
in
the
woods
of
that
vicinity
in
concealment
and
creeping
up
to
the
puye
the
following
night
then
after
sunrise
when
the
tehuas
would
begin
to
scatter
unarmed
and
unsuspecting
pouncing
upon
them
and
making
a
general
slaughter
tyope
had
under
his
direction
more
than
two
hundred
men
and
they
extended
over
a
wide
front
about
twenty
experienced
warriors
mostly
uakanyi
glided
in
advance
as
scouts
behind
them
came
at
a
suitable
distance
either
single
warriors
or
small
bands
the
main
body
came
last
it
was
divided
into
several
groups
near
the
centre
were
tyope
and
the
shaman
every
one
knew
that
his
duty
for
the
present
consisted
in
searching
for
traces
of
the
enemy
without
exposing
himself
to
discovery
should
a
single
tehua
be
observed
and
it
became
possible
for
a
scout
to
overpower
and
kill
him
without
noise
he
might
do
it
in
case
a
number
of
foes
were
noticed
the
spy
was
to
give
quiet
warning
to
the
man
nearest
to
him
that
one
to
those
in
his
rear
and
they
were
to
send
a
runner
to
inform
tyope
in
the
mean
time
all
were
to
halt
until
orders
came
to
move
in
a
new
direction
for
tyope
although
he
did
not
in
the
least
suspect
that
the
tehuas
were
forewarned
and
still
less
on
the
alert
so
close
by
the
rito
used
every
possible
precaution
in
order
that
the
surprise
might
be
complete
and
the
blow
as
crushing
as
possible
it
was
dark
in
the
timber
and
the
main
body
of
the
queres
approached
the
brink
of
the
first
cañon
north
of
the
rito
while
the
advance
were
cautiously
descending
into
the
bottom
and
the
scouts
were
already
farther
on
tyope
and
the
were
standing
a
short
distance
from
the
descent
of
the
south
side
and
listening
to
the
news
which
a
runner
had
just
brought
in
from
the
front
are
you
sure
you
have
noticed
a
man
the
chayan
asked
in
a
whisper
i
am
sure
of
it
he
crouched
at
the
foot
of
a
replied
the
messenger
positively
has
he
seen
you
demanded
tyope
i
believe
not
when
you
left
was
he
there
still
i
could
not
see
any
more
of
him
how
far
is
it
from
here
where
stands
the
tree
the
chayan
asked
it
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
ravine
near
the
border
to
the
left
tyope
pondered
a
while
then
he
said
to
the
shaman
nashtio
yaya
i
think
we
should
go
more
toward
the
east
what
do
you
say
it
is
well
muttered
the
satyumishe
tyope
said
to
the
runner
go
and
tell
the
men
to
go
along
the
ravine
toward
the
rio
grande
until
the
trees
become
smaller
thence
they
may
go
to
the
north
again
but
slowly
and
carefully
ziua
he
called
to
one
of
the
bystanders
go
and
tell
those
toward
the
left
to
come
where
i
stand
ohotika
calling
another
run
to
the
right
and
command
those
there
to
wait
until
we
join
them
the
runners
left
in
the
directions
indicated
the
information
which
had
just
been
conveyed
to
tyope
was
most
disagreeable
the
presence
of
one
human
being
at
the
time
and
place
indicated
looked
very
suspicious
if
the
man
had
seen
his
warriors
he
would
certainly
run
home
and
give
the
alarm
all
tyope
could
do
now
was
to
keep
as
close
as
possible
to
the
rio
grande
push
up
parallel
with
the
river
as
cautiously
as
possible
and
thus
sneak
beyond
the
enemy
in
case
as
he
still
could
not
believe
the
latter
were
in
anything
like
a
considerable
force
he
would
thus
eventually
place
himself
between
them
and
their
village
after
a
while
the
warriors
from
the
left
came
on
hastily
stumbling
through
the
darkness
all
together
now
went
down
in
an
easterly
direction
where
the
right
wing
if
this
term
can
be
used
was
halting
thence
tyope
despatched
runners
ahead
to
inquire
whether
everything
was
quiet
in
front
to
repeat
the
order
of
slow
marching
and
to
direct
them
to
halt
on
the
northern
brink
of
the
cañada
ancha
when
the
runners
left
the
march
was
resumed
in
the
usual
scattering
manner
as
if
all
were
skirmishers
tyope
and
the
shaman
remained
together
neither
uttered
a
word
the
commander
looked
up
to
the
stars
from
time
to
time
they
were
peeping
out
more
and
more
for
the
clouds
were
dispersing
only
from
the
southwest
distant
thunder
sounded
and
lightning
flashed
occasionally
a
shower
was
falling
in
that
direction
it
was
past
midnight
when
the
main
body
came
up
with
the
advance
guard
after
crossing
the
cañada
ancha
tyope
found
everything
in
order
and
he
directed
a
farther
advance
tyope
was
angry
the
circuit
which
he
had
felt
obliged
to
make
made
a
serious
delay
and
there
was
danger
that
with
the
early
sunrise
of
the
summer
months
he
might
be
behind
to
such
an
extent
as
to
be
unable
to
reach
the
cover
of
the
woods
in
time
if
the
tehuas
were
informed
of
his
approach
they
would
either
prepare
for
his
coming
at
the
puye
and
the
result
of
an
open
attack
would
be
to
say
the
least
extremely
doubtful
or
they
would
come
out
in
force
and
desultory
fighting
would
ensue
in
this
those
who
were
nearest
water
and
supplies
always
had
the
advantage
his
idea
of
striking
a
sudden
blow
appeared
very
much
endangered
by
the
presence
of
tehuas
in
the
forest
he
thought
and
thought
without
arriving
at
any
satisfactory
conclusion
return
to
the
rito
he
could
not
for
such
a
retreat
was
worse
than
disaster
neither
could
he
decide
alone
the
hishtanyi
chayan
was
by
his
side
and
he
had
to
consult
him
so
he
stood
still
and
turned
to
the
shaman
saying
nashtio
yaya
the
night
will
soon
be
over
and
the
sun
may
come
out
from
behind
the
mountain
in
the
east
ko
grunted
the
it
is
far
yet
to
the
houses
of
the
moshome
tehua
the
chayan
stood
still
sa
uishe
nashtio
said
he
the
shiuana
direct
us
to
go
on
a
different
road
i
saw
an
owl
fly
toward
the
moon
let
us
go
away
from
the
river
into
the
kote
to
rest
and
to
hide
until
the
sun
goes
down
again
and
we
may
go
farther
toward
the
katityam
of
the
enemy
this
was
just
as
tyope
wanted
he
disliked
the
idea
of
passing
a
day
concealed
under
cliffs
and
crags
where
a
torrid
sun
shone
and
where
there
was
water
only
in
the
river
beneath
and
at
a
great
depth
but
he
wanted
to
be
sure
of
what
those
above
intended
so
he
asked
again
yaya
chayan
do
the
shiuana
he
emphasized
the
term
say
that
we
should
go
to
the
west
the
spirits
say
that
we
should
go
where
there
is
shade
and
water
let
us
go
to
the
mountains
there
we
shall
find
both
they
are
right
tyope
exclaimed
i
believe
it
is
better
to
stay
there
until
the
sun
has
risen
i
will
send
word
to
the
men
to
turn
to
the
left
and
we
will
sleep
in
the
shade
of
the
trees
until
the
time
comes
to
advance
you
are
right
brother
the
chayan
assented
do
as
you
have
said
the
two
men
had
lagged
behind
the
others
during
this
conversation
tyope
imitated
the
cry
of
an
owl
soon
several
warriors
came
up
to
him
he
directed
them
to
go
to
the
front
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
and
give
orders
that
all
should
move
to
the
westward
a
short
distance
far
enough
to
reach
high
timber
then
all
should
halt
and
prepare
to
pass
the
night
he
himself
moved
a
short
distance
only
in
that
direction
in
company
with
the
shaman
and
selected
a
spot
where
the
mesa
was
covered
with
the
usual
underbrush
and
where
taller
trees
already
began
to
appear
here
he
lay
down
to
rest
with
eyes
wide
open
ready
for
any
emergency
not
far
away
the
found
a
secluded
spot
where
he
sat
down
without
fire
occasionally
touching
the
drum
and
reciting
his
prayers
and
incantations
they
were
the
same
as
those
which
the
shaman
of
the
tehuas
was
directing
to
those
above
at
the
same
time
and
not
far
from
him
but
in
a
different
tongue
for
the
success
of
his
people
and
the
destruction
of
those
for
whom
the
hishtanyi
chayan
was
praying
the
decision
of
tyope
to
penetrate
into
the
forest
to
the
west
brought
the
queres
into
the
very
position
which
the
tehuas
desired
the
scouts
of
the
latter
had
obeyed
punctually
and
diligently
the
orders
which
they
had
received
following
step
by
step
the
advancing
foe
and
reporting
to
headquarters
any
notable
move
they
possessed
the
immense
advantage
of
knowing
every
movement
the
queres
made
from
the
very
beginning
and
were
thus
able
to
observe
them
unseen
as
soon
as
tyope
had
concentrated
his
forces
on
the
northern
brink
of
the
cañada
ancha
the
main
body
of
the
tehuas
receded
slightly
to
the
west
as
soon
as
the
queres
began
to
ascend
in
that
direction
the
retrograde
movement
of
the
others
continued
in
the
centre
whereas
the
left
wing
spread
out
and
the
right
slightly
advanced
to
the
east
along
the
brink
of
the
ravine
the
scouts
were
called
in
with
all
haste
and
reinforced
especially
the
body
that
faced
the
queres
in
the
north
at
the
time
tyope
lay
down
to
rest
his
forces
were
surrounded
everywhere
except
on
the
east
everything
was
ready
for
the
tehuas
to
begin
their
attack
upon
the
unsuspecting
foe
at
daybreak
chapter
xviii
the
change
from
night
to
daylight
in
new
mexico
is
by
no
means
sudden
darkness
yields
slowly
to
the
illumination
streaming
from
the
east
and
when
the
moon
is
shining
one
remains
in
doubt
for
quite
a
while
whether
the
growing
brightness
is
due
to
the
mistress
of
night
or
to
the
lord
of
day
nowhere
is
this
more
perceptible
than
on
high
plateaus
covered
by
sparse
timber
suddenly
awaking
one
is
in
doubt
at
first
whether
it
is
sunrise
or
the
full
moon
that
illuminates
the
landscape
the
shadows
are
weakened
but
objects
are
not
much
more
distinct
a
glow
pervades
the
air
rather
than
a
positive
light
when
the
indian
is
on
the
he
sleeps
but
little
and
never
long
he
prefers
the
day
to
the
night
for
rest
as
he
can
conceal
his
movements
better
in
the
darkness
tyope
had
halted
his
little
army
just
before
daybreak
because
he
felt
afraid
of
going
any
farther
and
because
he
had
arrived
close
to
the
place
where
he
desired
to
remain
during
the
day
without
exposing
his
forces
to
the
chance
of
discovery
none
of
his
men
slept
none
of
them
dozed
even
they
had
all
been
warned
of
the
possible
presence
of
foes
and
although
there
seemed
not
the
slightest
evidence
of
those
foes
being
aware
of
their
coming
yet
the
mere
apprehension
caused
uneasiness
there
was
therefore
increased
watchfulness
on
their
part
every
one
among
the
queres
was
looking
forward
with
anxiety
to
the
hour
when
there
would
be
sufficient
light
to
investigate
the
situation
more
closely
the
sky
had
cleared
the
air
became
cooler
and
the
morning
star
shone
brightly
in
spite
of
the
luminous
crescent
of
a
waning
moon
the
hishtanyi
chayan
was
sitting
at
the
same
place
where
he
had
retired
a
few
hours
before
but
he
no
longer
prayed
he
stared
motionless
tyope
lay
on
his
back
behind
a
he
was
watching
the
sky
and
the
approach
of
dawn
a
number
of
warriors
had
lain
down
in
the
vicinity
awaiting
the
signal
to
move
one
of
these
had
placed
himself
in
such
a
position
that
he
could
glance
at
the
forest
which
loomed
up
before
him
like
a
mass
of
dense
shadows
with
rays
of
moonlight
between
he
peered
into
that
maze
of
darkness
and
light
for
hours
but
nothing
appeared
in
it
worthy
of
note
so
the
queres
warrior
turned
around
on
his
back
in
order
to
change
position
he
saw
the
moon
rise
to
the
zenith
and
the
corona
borealis
disappear
below
the
western
horizon
he
noticed
also
how
the
stars
grew
dimmer
and
dimmer
how
the
shadows
commenced
to
wane
finally
he
fixed
his
gaze
on
the
east
owing
to
the
shrubbery
it
was
not
possible
to
see
distinctly
yet
anything
lying
on
the
ground
could
be
discerned
from
the
place
where
he
lay
the
queres
indian
looked
through
a
lane
bordered
on
both
sides
by
bushes
of
cedar
and
juniper
at
the
end
of
that
lane
he
discovered
a
dark
spot
that
spot
disappeared
while
he
was
still
gazing
at
it
he
strained
his
eyes
to
find
the
spot
again
but
it
had
really
vanished
the
man
from
the
rito
became
suspicious
again
he
looked
but
the
spot
or
object
whatever
it
might
be
had
gone
out
of
sight
altogether
he
crawled
over
to
the
man
nearest
him
told
him
what
had
occurred
and
returned
to
his
post
the
dark
speck
or
thing
had
not
reappeared
but
on
the
right
side
of
the
gallery
formed
by
the
trees
it
seemed
as
if
somewhat
nearer
to
his
own
position
something
black
became
apparent
and
disappeared
in
an
instant
the
scout
strained
both
ear
and
eye
nothing
could
be
heard
and
nothing
else
of
a
suspicious
character
met
his
gaze
meanwhile
his
companion
had
crept
over
to
where
tyope
was
lying
and
had
reported
to
the
commander
the
strange
apparition
tyope
turned
over
so
as
to
face
the
east
and
said
it
is
well
he
also
began
to
scan
the
network
of
shadows
and
illuminated
patches
extending
in
that
direction
the
indian
who
had
spoken
to
him
went
back
to
his
post
but
very
soon
returned
whispering
somebody
has
crossed
over
from
one
tree
to
another
where
tyope
asked
in
a
subdued
voice
there
replied
the
scout
pointing
with
his
hand
toward
a
group
of
bushes
it
is
well
said
the
leader
go
back
and
keep
your
eyes
open
the
indian
crawled
off
tyope
rose
to
his
knees
seized
two
branches
of
the
tree
behind
which
he
had
been
reclining
and
bent
them
asunder
in
this
manner
he
was
able
to
overlook
the
ground
to
the
east
at
a
greater
height
than
before
the
light
had
increased
but
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
discern
any
object
at
a
distance
daylight
was
growing
on
the
waning
night
had
tyope
stood
up
and
looked
toward
the
east
he
would
have
seen
the
dark
sinuous
line
which
the
mountains
east
of
santa
fé
trace
along
that
part
of
the
horizon
their
uppermost
were
beginning
to
glisten
in
the
light
streaming
up
from
beyond
on
tyope
left
a
rustling
sound
was
heard
he
turned
around
one
of
his
men
was
cautiously
approaching
there
are
moshome
in
front
of
us
i
know
it
replied
the
commander
how
many
have
you
seen
two
and
you
saw
them
clearly
yes
but
they
sneaked
off
did
they
seem
to
come
toward
us
they
crept
behind
a
juniper
and
after
that
i
could
see
nothing
more
do
the
others
know
it
not
yet
shall
i
tell
them
go
tell
them
afterward
return
here
to
me
tyope
felt
embarrassed
it
was
clear
to
him
that
several
tehuas
were
lurking
in
the
direction
whence
he
had
come
and
that
they
were
moving
toward
him
it
indicated
that
their
numbers
were
strong
enough
to
engage
him
that
looked
very
very
ominous
if
he
only
knew
how
matters
stood
elsewhere
and
whether
the
enemy
had
shown
himself
at
other
points
tyope
grew
very
uneasy
tactics
in
indian
warfare
reduce
themselves
to
a
game
of
he
who
must
show
himself
first
is
sure
of
suffering
the
greater
loss
tyope
knew
that
in
case
the
tehuas
had
actually
surrounded
him
they
had
the
greater
advantage
at
their
disposal
they
might
wait
much
longer
than
he
and
his
men
they
might
even
wait
for
days
keeping
the
queres
penned
up
in
uncertainty
and
then
break
out
as
soon
as
the
latter
were
sufficiently
exhausted
the
same
scout
approached
again
he
crawled
like
a
mole
nashtio
he
whispered
there
are
moshome
to
the
left
of
us
many
tyope
inquired
hastily
six
of
them
have
been
noticed
that
was
exceedingly
alarming
he
directed
the
man
to
stay
on
the
spot
while
he
glided
through
the
bushes
to
where
the
hishtanyi
chayan
had
spent
the
night
the
was
awake
and
looked
at
the
captain
in
astonishment
tyope
placed
a
finger
on
his
lips
and
shook
his
head
the
shaman
asked
sa
uishe
what
is
it
tzatze
raua
tzatze
raua
tyope
exclaimed
in
a
low
tone
the
tehuas
are
sneaking
about
us
like
shutzuna
there
are
many
of
them
and
they
come
up
from
the
east
what
shall
we
do
yaya
speak
tzatze
raua
the
shaman
repeated
shaking
his
head
as
you
say
the
moshome
come
up
behind
us
i
thought
tyope
suggested
of
sending
word
to
the
men
in
front
to
come
back
and
as
soon
as
we
could
see
anything
striking
the
enemies
in
our
rear
what
do
you
think
of
it
sa
nashtio
many
will
go
to
shipapu
the
chayan
muttered
what
shall
i
do
speak
tyope
insisted
the
last
words
of
the
shaman
frightened
him
the
chayan
gave
no
immediate
reply
but
sat
musing
in
a
manner
indicating
that
his
thoughts
were
with
those
above
at
last
he
raised
his
head
and
replied
we
must
wait
until
the
sun
stands
in
the
sky
tyope
suppressed
a
sigh
however
much
he
attributed
this
answer
of
the
shaman
to
inspiration
from
those
on
high
it
appeared
to
him
dangerous
tyope
felt
very
uneasy
but
he
was
no
coward
in
case
the
worst
had
really
happened
if
the
tehuas
had
anticipated
and
surrounded
him
he
still
inclined
to
the
conviction
that
concentration
of
his
forces
and
a
rapid
onslaught
on
the
foes
in
his
rear
would
not
only
save
him
but
secure
a
reasonable
number
of
coveted
trophies
if
this
could
be
speedily
effected
the
less
important
would
be
his
loss
in
attaining
it
for
as
long
as
the
light
was
faint
and
dim
the
enemy
missiles
could
not
be
discharged
with
certain
aim
he
had
hoped
that
the
chayan
would
assent
to
this
suggestion
now
on
the
contrary
the
oracle
spoke
in
a
manner
that
plainly
indicated
that
the
shiuana
ordered
him
to
wait
until
daylight
it
was
sure
destruction
he
felt
it
but
the
shiuana
spoke
through
the
medium
of
the
old
man
and
the
shiuana
were
of
course
right
he
could
not
complain
or
even
grumble
but
he
might
at
least
prepare
everything
in
advance
so
that
as
soon
as
the
gave
the
signal
his
favourite
move
might
be
executed
with
a
promptness
and
alacrity
that
would
surprise
the
enemy
so
tyope
crept
back
to
the
in
whose
neighbourhood
his
men
were
grouped
dawn
was
coming
on
and
the
shadows
were
beginning
to
assume
definite
shapes
and
directions
tyope
sighed
when
he
noticed
the
approach
of
sunlight
precious
time
was
being
irretrievably
lost
he
relieved
the
warrior
whom
he
had
left
at
his
post
the
latter
whispered
to
him
that
nothing
suspicious
had
turned
up
suddenly
tyope
started
and
pressed
his
ear
to
the
ground
then
he
darted
up
rising
to
his
knees
and
listened
straining
every
nerve
his
head
turned
to
the
southwest
in
that
direction
arose
loud
yells
they
were
followed
by
piercing
cries
soon
the
sounds
mingled
so
as
to
create
a
noise
like
that
which
a
struggle
between
men
and
wolves
might
produce
these
sounds
told
tyope
that
a
severe
engagement
had
commenced
in
that
direction
at
the
same
time
it
struck
him
that
the
main
body
of
the
tehuas
were
probably
south
and
east
of
his
forces
and
that
consequently
by
moving
swiftly
westward
he
could
interpose
himself
between
the
tehuas
and
their
homes
cut
off
their
warriors
from
their
village
and
secure
complete
triumph
but
before
he
could
order
such
a
change
of
tactics
he
ought
to
know
something
definite
from
the
quarter
where
the
fight
had
begun
to
send
a
runner
seemed
unadvisable
for
he
thought
it
unsafe
to
lessen
the
forces
around
him
if
only
by
a
man
several
of
his
companions
had
approached
startled
by
the
sudden
noise
he
motioned
them
to
return
to
their
posts
the
noise
of
the
battle
diminished
then
it
broke
out
anew
and
sounded
nearer
it
seemed
to
extend
to
the
east
in
the
west
and
north
everything
remained
quiet
the
enemy
appeared
to
be
entirely
southwest
and
east
of
the
little
army
which
tyope
commanded
he
felt
relieved
and
a
grim
satisfaction
crept
over
his
mind
he
thought
surely
the
tehuas
have
committed
a
grave
mistake
if
only
his
people
would
report
to
him
now
at
last
the
bushes
rattled
and
a
man
stepped
up
in
a
tone
of
intense
agitation
he
said
where
is
the
i
am
here
replied
tyope
in
a
muffled
voice
motioning
the
warrior
to
lie
down
the
latter
either
failed
to
notice
the
gesture
or
misunderstood
it
and
walked
on
upright
something
whizzed
through
the
branches
of
the
shrubs
the
messenger
bent
as
if
suddenly
folded
up
he
grasped
at
his
stomach
with
his
hand
and
tumbled
to
the
ground
tyope
stood
by
his
side
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
shaft
of
an
arrow
was
sticking
in
his
body
and
in
vain
did
the
wounded
man
try
to
pluck
it
out
regardless
of
the
horrible
pain
the
unfortunate
one
was
suffering
bent
upon
catching
the
drift
of
his
message
before
the
soul
could
escape
the
tortured
body
tyope
almost
lay
down
on
the
groaning
man
what
news
do
you
bring
speak
he
hissed
into
his
ear
the
wounded
warrior
moaned
moaned
again
tyope
grew
wild
speak
he
growled
and
shook
him
by
the
shoulder
so
rudely
that
the
other
screamed
the
moshome
he
gasped
they
they
have
come
on
to
us
a
chill
went
through
his
body
he
lay
there
gasping
incapable
of
speech
tyope
was
frenzied
he
again
shook
the
dying
man
ruthlessly
where
have
they
attacked
he
roared
west
have
they
killed
any
of
our
people
i
do
know
breathed
the
poor
fellow
his
head
was
swaying
it
rolled
back
and
forth
on
the
ground
tyope
could
not
obtain
any
further
reply
so
he
crawled
back
and
left
him
to
die
the
moor
had
done
his
duty
the
moor
might
go
to
shipapu
tyope
had
been
so
eager
to
secure
from
the
dying
man
any
information
the
latter
might
still
be
able
to
impart
that
he
paid
no
immediate
attention
to
the
noise
and
uproar
which
had
arisen
in
his
own
vicinity
almost
at
the
very
moment
when
the
queres
warrior
was
mortally
wounded
one
of
tyope
companions
despatched
one
of
his
arrows
at
a
tehua
whom
he
had
distinctly
seen
in
front
this
shot
he
accompanied
by
a
loud
yell
the
foe
replied
to
the
challenge
in
the
same
manner
arrows
whizzed
and
hissed
through
the
air
crossing
each
other
and
tearing
through
the
shrubbery
or
penetrating
the
trunks
of
trees
with
dull
thuds
the
fight
had
begun
here
too
but
little
if
any
damage
was
done
as
yet
by
either
side
most
of
the
arrows
were
shot
at
random
and
both
parties
whooped
and
yelled
their
purpose
was
manifestly
to
frighten
the
adversary
by
creating
an
exaggerated
impression
of
their
own
numbers
and
strength
all
this
did
not
make
an
unfavourable
impression
upon
tyope
on
the
contrary
as
soon
as
he
saw
that
the
engagement
had
broken
out
in
his
rear
also
he
felt
a
thrill
of
pleasure
and
changed
his
plans
at
once
he
believed
now
in
presence
of
the
attacks
made
by
the
tehuas
that
the
latter
had
indeed
placed
all
their
men
between
him
and
the
rito
and
that
consequently
the
road
to
the
puye
lay
open
and
he
could
rush
up
capture
the
women
and
children
and
hold
them
for
ransom
but
he
must
move
swiftly
and
energetically
leaving
the
fight
to
go
on
as
best
it
might
by
advancing
with
a
part
of
his
forces
first
to
the
west
and
then
straight
to
the
north
tyope
might
execute
his
plan
of
leaving
enough
men
behind
to
make
a
desperate
stand
against
the
tehuas
here
without
the
consent
of
the
hishtanyi
chayan
however
he
felt
unauthorized
to
adopt
decisive
measures
so
he
again
crept
over
to
the
shaman
and
communicated
his
plans
to
him
to
his
delight
the
old
man
rose
and
said
it
is
well
let
us
go
it
was
daylight
now
and
everything
could
be
plainly
seen
the
extended
skirmishing
went
on
with
less
ardour
than
before
neither
party
pressing
the
other
very
closely
tyope
glided
back
to
one
of
his
men
an
arrow
well
directed
struck
the
ground
very
near
whispering
into
his
ear
the
change
of
programme
tyope
took
off
his
shield
turned
it
toward
the
enemy
and
rose
on
his
right
knee
fastened
to
the
left
arm
and
resting
on
the
ground
with
its
lower
rim
the
shield
covered
the
kneeling
man
almost
completely
the
left
hand
held
the
bow
and
the
weapon
slightly
protruded
from
behind
the
protecting
target
tyope
then
pushed
his
body
forward
from
behind
the
bush
where
he
had
been
crouching
hardly
was
the
shield
visible
when
its
owner
felt
a
sudden
blow
against
it
and
the
point
of
an
arrow
came
through
the
hide
the
shot
must
have
come
from
a
short
distance
or
it
would
not
have
pierced
the
shield
ere
tyope
discovered
whence
it
came
his
companion
had
discharged
his
bow
and
with
a
loud
whoop
hurled
himself
forward
where
he
fell
headlong
behind
a
little
tree
wild
yells
sounded
from
the
tehuas
and
several
of
their
warriors
rushed
up
to
the
spot
branches
rattled
and
bushes
shook
as
the
men
brushed
past
them
tyope
had
an
arrow
ready
and
he
despatched
it
at
one
of
his
foes
he
pulled
another
from
the
quiver
without
looking
to
see
whether
the
first
had
struck
a
mark
or
not
darted
up
and
with
a
shout
bounded
ahead
to
encounter
the
enemy
a
shot
grazed
his
right
hand
scratching
the
wrist
and
causing
him
to
drop
his
arrow
for
a
time
the
arm
was
numb
but
tyope
heeded
it
not
where
the
man
who
had
stood
beside
him
had
fallen
a
number
of
warriors
from
both
sides
were
wrangling
a
queres
lay
dead
on
the
dead
body
of
a
tehua
whose
scalp
he
had
intended
to
secure
two
of
his
brethren
were
defending
his
corpse
against
half
a
dozen
tehuas
tyope
right
wrist
had
been
paralyzed
by
the
but
he
raised
his
arm
and
flung
the
that
dangled
from
it
against
the
head
of
the
nearest
foe
the
blow
was
too
feeble
and
tyope
grabbed
the
man
hair
arrows
whizzed
and
shrieked
past
the
fighting
group
shrill
yells
and
wild
howling
sounded
from
every
quarter
the
contending
parties
exchanged
insulting
cries
and
abusive
words
in
both
languages
the
tehua
whom
tyope
had
grabbed
by
the
hair
made
desperate
lunges
at
him
from
below
with
a
sharply
pointed
arrow
he
succeeded
in
slightly
wounding
him
in
several
places
tyope
kicked
him
in
the
abdomen
causing
him
to
double
up
at
once
regardless
of
the
pain
in
the
right
hand
tyope
succeeded
in
grasping
the
at
last
with
it
he
directed
several
blows
at
the
head
of
the
enemy
but
they
were
so
weak
that
only
at
the
third
stroke
did
the
tehua
fall
at
this
juncture
an
arrow
grazed
tyope
temple
he
looked
up
and
saw
that
he
had
been
very
imprudent
in
yielding
so
far
to
ardour
and
excitement
as
to
mingle
with
his
men
in
a
strife
for
the
possession
of
a
single
scalp
and
thus
expose
unduly
his
own
person
he
began
to
think
of
withdrawal
into
the
neighbourhood
of
the
hishtanyi
chayan
but
it
was
not
easy
to
extricate
himself
warding
off
a
blow
aimed
at
his
skull
with
his
shield
he
pushed
it
into
the
face
of
the
new
assailant
with
sufficient
force
to
cause
the
man
to
stagger
then
he
shouted
a
few
words
to
his
own
men
turned
around
and
rushed
back
to
his
tree
where
he
fell
down
at
full
length
exhausted
and
bleeding
the
other
queres
two
in
number
followed
his
example
and
the
tehuas
did
not
pursue
the
result
was
so
far
favourable
to
the
queres
that
they
lost
but
one
man
and
the
tehuas
two
but
the
scalp
of
the
dead
man
from
the
rito
remained
with
the
enemy
when
tyope
had
recovered
his
breath
he
sneaked
back
to
where
he
had
left
the
shaman
as
he
approached
the
spot
he
heard
the
singing
and
beating
his
drum
it
was
a
very
good
sign
to
see
the
shaman
at
work
with
such
enthusiasm
still
tyope
must
disturb
him
sa
nashtio
he
cried
we
must
go
shouted
the
praying
shaman
drumming
incessantly
he
was
in
ecstasies
his
uplifted
eyes
sparkled
he
paid
no
attention
to
what
was
around
him
sa
nashtio
yaya
tyope
anxiously
insisted
do
not
disturb
me
let
me
alone
cried
the
hishtanyi
chayan
aloud
tyope
was
in
despair
arrow
after
arrow
was
flying
past
him
rending
twigs
and
shattering
branches
the
tehuas
shot
faster
than
the
queres
they
must
have
a
large
supply
of
missiles
every
shot
was
accompanied
by
triumphant
yells
the
enemy
was
growing
bolder
again
the
leader
tried
to
rouse
the
to
decisive
action
but
the
latter
only
shook
his
head
in
an
irritated
manner
and
proceeded
with
his
song
louder
and
louder
at
last
he
dropped
his
drum
jumped
to
his
feet
and
began
to
dance
and
to
stamp
shaking
his
rattle
and
wildly
yelling
raua
raua
then
he
stood
still
and
looked
around
as
if
aroused
from
a
dream
at
the
sight
of
tyope
he
remembered
and
spoke
panting
still
it
is
well
they
are
good
those
above
we
will
do
as
you
said
heedless
of
missiles
he
walked
on
into
the
forest
tyope
heaved
a
great
sigh
of
relief
a
small
whistle
made
of
bone
depended
from
tyope
neck
he
raised
it
to
his
lips
and
blew
a
shrill
piercing
blast
the
warriors
in
his
neighbourhood
turned
their
faces
toward
him
he
beckoned
to
one
of
them
to
approach
to
this
man
he
gave
directions
in
a
low
tone
they
were
to
the
effect
that
they
should
offer
the
most
determined
resistance
to
the
enemy
while
at
the
same
time
they
were
to
retire
gradually
but
slowly
from
the
actual
position
as
if
yielding
to
pressure
their
sturdy
resistance
was
to
cover
the
movements
of
the
main
body
tyope
now
stealthily
crept
away
from
the
line
of
the
fight
soon
he
met
a
group
of
his
people
who
outside
of
the
range
of
missiles
were
waiting
to
be
called
into
action
he
sent
the
majority
of
them
to
the
front
to
reinforce
the
others
two
runners
were
despatched
to
the
south
and
southwest
with
orders
with
the
remainder
he
set
out
slowly
penetrating
deeper
into
the
timber
he
thus
collected
one
after
another
the
various
groups
into
a
fairly
compact
body
always
sending
a
few
men
back
to
reinforce
the
fighting
portions
over
one
hundred
men
were
now
engaged
with
the
tehuas
the
remainder
moved
as
tyope
confidently
hoped
upon
the
of
the
unprotected
puye
by
a
detour
which
would
enable
the
queres
to
avoid
the
rather
exposed
site
of
tzirege
a
tremendous
noise
from
the
south
indicated
that
a
encounter
was
going
on
there
the
noise
lasted
but
a
short
time
then
it
subsided
shortly
afterward
a
warrior
rushed
panting
up
to
tyope
nashtio
he
said
the
moshome
have
taken
five
scalps
where
tyope
snorted
there
he
pointed
southward
and
we
three
have
the
people
gone
back
a
little
it
is
well
tell
the
men
to
come
still
farther
this
way
but
very
slowly
he
ordered
five
of
his
own
men
to
go
back
with
the
runner
to
replace
the
five
whom
the
tehuas
had
killed
with
the
rest
he
pushed
forward
he
kept
beside
the
hishtanyi
chayan
and
both
walked
almost
at
the
head
of
their
little
troupe
only
a
few
scouts
preceded
them
so
completely
safe
did
tyope
feel
about
the
west
and
northwest
the
action
in
the
rear
seemed
to
lag
a
wild
uproar
broke
out
in
the
southwest
but
no
messenger
came
with
evil
tidings
the
queres
maintained
themselves
all
was
well
the
engagement
had
lasted
two
hours
already
and
it
might
continue
in
this
way
for
hours
more
without
coming
to
a
crisis
in
the
mean
time
tyope
would
creep
up
to
the
women
and
children
of
the
tehuas
in
case
the
should
be
ultimately
destroyed
by
the
enemy
it
mattered
little
for
by
capturing
the
the
queres
still
remained
masters
of
the
situation
tyope
was
explaining
all
this
to
the
hishtanyi
chayan
and
the
two
in
consequence
of
their
conversation
had
remained
behind
the
foremost
the
shaman
was
listening
and
from
time
to
time
grunting
assent
to
tyope
explanations
suddenly
the
shrubbery
in
front
rattled
and
moved
violently
as
though
deer
were
endeavouring
to
tear
through
it
at
full
speed
at
the
same
time
there
arose
in
that
very
west
which
had
been
so
still
and
close
upon
the
two
men
a
fearful
uttered
by
many
voices
like
wildfire
this
threatening
howl
spread
to
the
west
it
seemed
to
run
along
an
arc
of
a
circle
from
the
northwest
to
the
south
the
warriors
in
front
came
running
back
in
dismay
many
of
them
were
already
wounded
one
reached
the
spot
where
the
commander
and
the
shaman
were
standing
there
he
fell
to
the
ground
headlong
blood
flowing
from
his
mouth
his
body
had
been
shot
through
and
through
however
great
his
surprise
at
that
completely
unexpected
attack
and
however
disastrous
it
must
be
to
all
his
plans
tyope
not
only
did
not
lose
his
head
but
rather
seemed
to
grow
cool
and
and
an
expression
of
sinister
quiet
settled
on
his
features
yet
he
was
internally
far
from
being
at
ease
or
hopeful
he
blew
his
whistle
without
regard
to
his
office
the
old
shaman
crouched
behind
a
shrub
where
placing
his
shield
before
him
he
listened
and
spied
the
had
imitated
tyope
example
the
magician
was
now
turned
into
a
warrior
the
signal
given
by
the
was
heard
by
very
few
only
for
the
yells
of
the
tehuas
drowned
every
other
noise
the
enemy
this
time
rushed
up
without
any
preliminary
skirmishing
and
the
surprise
was
so
sudden
that
the
queres
were
running
back
in
every
direction
with
their
foes
in
close
pursuit
they
had
no
time
to
gather
or
to
hide
ere
tyope
knew
it
his
men
were
far
away
in
his
rear
as
well
as
a
number
of
his
enemies
also
to
his
left
he
noticed
one
of
his
tribe
lying
on
the
ground
dead
and
a
tehua
standing
with
both
feet
on
his
back
cutting
and
jerking
at
the
scalp
of
the
dead
man
tyope
was
alone
for
the
had
fled
the
tehua
was
so
intent
upon
securing
the
trophy
that
he
had
not
seen
tyope
and
he
could
easily
have
killed
him
but
hurried
footsteps
many
voices
and
the
shaking
of
bushes
in
front
showed
plainly
that
quite
a
numerous
body
of
tehuas
was
rapidly
coming
toward
him
his
own
life
was
too
precious
in
this
hour
of
terrible
need
to
permit
exposure
for
the
sake
of
killing
one
enemy
so
he
turned
about
softly
on
his
knees
the
tehua
still
did
not
pay
any
attention
to
him
and
now
the
temptation
was
too
great
he
quickly
placed
an
arrow
on
the
string
and
sent
the
shaft
thanks
to
the
short
distance
between
the
ribs
of
the
unsuspecting
foe
then
with
a
yell
of
triumph
and
defiance
he
darted
off
in
the
direction
whither
his
men
had
scattered
he
had
been
noticed
by
some
of
the
tehuas
who
were
coming
up
from
the
west
and
without
delay
they
followed
in
pursuit
but
it
was
not
easy
to
overtake
a
man
like
tyope
when
fleeing
for
life
the
powerful
onslaught
of
the
tehuas
had
scattered
the
queres
in
such
a
manner
that
friend
and
foe
were
intermingled
in
the
forest
and
it
was
not
safe
for
the
pursuers
to
shoot
at
the
fugitives
who
were
only
occasionally
visible
between
and
bushes
for
the
arrow
might
have
struck
a
friend
tyope
ran
so
fast
that
he
soon
left
his
pursuers
far
behind
him
when
he
noticed
that
their
shouting
sounded
more
distant
he
stopped
crouched
under
a
bush
that
grew
near
the
foot
of
a
large
tree
and
listened
and
peered
again
he
was
breathless
from
the
rapid
flight
and
his
heart
throbbed
so
violently
at
first
that
he
could
not
clearly
distinguish
sound
from
sound
at
last
he
grew
quiet
and
now
heard
the
din
that
seemed
to
fill
the
entire
forest
in
every
direction
except
the
north
it
was
nearest
toward
the
east
and
south
and
there
the
fight
seemed
to
concentrate
above
the
shouting
yelling
whooping
sounded
the
piercing
there
could
be
no
thought
of
still
winning
anything
like
success
for
the
day
was
irretrievably
disastrously
lost
to
save
as
many
of
the
survivors
as
possible
was
all
that
could
be
done
tyope
would
have
raved
had
it
been
of
any
avail
this
terrible
failure
he
saw
clearly
ruined
his
prospects
forever
he
wished
to
die
and
despair
began
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
to
fill
his
heart
the
noise
of
the
battle
was
now
approaching
rapidly
from
the
east
and
south
the
tehuas
were
forcing
his
men
into
a
confused
mass
it
was
no
longer
an
action
it
was
becoming
a
slaughter
a
butchery
of
the
vanquished
tyope
felt
as
if
chills
and
fever
were
alternately
running
through
him
his
people
were
without
head
for
the
hishtanyi
chayan
was
useless
as
a
leader
he
must
try
to
get
through
and
as
it
was
impossible
to
force
a
passage
he
determined
to
steal
through
at
all
hazards
a
number
of
tehuas
had
passed
without
seeing
him
in
their
eagerness
to
reach
the
into
which
the
timbered
plateau
above
the
cañada
ancha
was
converted
tyope
improved
the
opportunity
to
slip
from
one
tree
to
another
toward
where
the
greatest
uproar
was
heard
voices
sounded
quite
near
and
he
cowered
down
between
two
cedars
the
voices
came
nearer
and
the
more
he
listened
the
more
he
became
convinced
that
his
own
tongue
was
spoken
he
was
on
the
point
of
rising
and
going
up
to
the
parties
who
spoke
queres
for
they
must
be
friends
he
distinctly
heard
his
name
he
looked
and
looked
anxiously
for
he
preferred
to
find
out
who
they
were
ere
addressing
them
as
they
came
closer
he
thought
he
recognized
a
woman
voice
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
voices
and
at
last
a
group
of
men
stood
out
between
the
trees
they
were
warriors
of
the
tehuas
and
in
their
midst
was
a
woman
she
was
speaking
to
one
of
them
in
the
language
of
the
rito
and
all
around
her
seemed
to
be
attentively
listening
he
stared
at
her
stared
his
starting
from
their
sockets
his
face
colouring
and
then
becoming
almost
black
had
any
one
seen
tyope
at
that
moment
he
must
have
taken
him
for
some
baffled
and
terrified
demon
from
the
nether
world
he
felt
neither
indignation
nor
passion
his
heart
stood
still
so
wonderful
was
the
discovery
he
was
making
that
he
was
benumbed
body
and
soul
for
that
woman
who
so
confidently
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
enemies
of
her
tribe
and
who
spoke
to
them
with
an
air
of
assurance
bordering
upon
authority
uttering
his
own
name
time
and
again
was
shotaye
once
more
his
passion
came
back
and
delirious
with
rage
and
frenzied
with
fury
he
lifted
the
bow
with
the
ready
arrow
but
so
monstrous
was
the
sight
to
his
eyes
that
his
hand
dropped
paralyzed
and
he
was
unable
to
speed
the
shaft
he
stood
disarmed
and
stared
gaping
like
a
fiend
in
despair
who
does
not
venture
to
oppose
his
master
he
understood
now
the
connection
of
events
the
unexpected
ambush
he
saw
that
it
could
not
have
happened
otherwise
he
saw
it
clearly
to
his
shame
the
woman
whom
he
had
persecuted
for
years
and
whom
he
was
certain
that
he
should
destroy
utterly
at
the
end
of
this
campaign
had
outwitted
him
and
destroyed
his
plans
and
hopes
forever
then
let
her
suffer
for
it
he
raised
his
bow
dropped
it
again
and
stared
it
was
not
pity
that
fettered
his
otherwise
ruthless
hand
it
was
superstitious
fear
that
shotaye
could
have
divined
all
his
secret
moves
and
could
have
saved
herself
at
the
right
moment
filled
him
with
astonishment
and
gradually
with
invincible
dread
she
was
no
common
witch
such
wonderful
insight
such
clear
perception
of
the
means
to
save
herself
and
at
the
same
time
destroy
him
were
not
human
rage
and
passion
disappeared
a
chill
went
through
his
frame
and
his
lower
jaw
hung
down
like
that
of
a
corpse
as
he
stared
motionless
powerless
to
act
and
unable
to
move
a
change
came
over
tyope
a
change
so
sudden
and
so
complete
that
he
was
henceforth
another
man
hope
ambition
revenge
vanished
from
his
thoughts
and
with
them
all
energy
left
him
the
appearance
of
that
woman
crushed
him
utterly
shotaye
appeared
to
him
by
the
side
of
the
great
war
shaman
of
his
enemies
like
some
fiend
to
be
sure
but
a
fiend
of
so
much
higher
rank
than
his
own
that
it
was
futile
to
cope
with
her
the
indian
believes
in
evil
spirits
but
even
they
are
subjected
to
the
power
of
deities
of
a
higher
order
beneficial
to
mankind
as
such
a
shuatyam
the
woman
appeared
to
tyope
as
one
whom
the
shiuana
had
directed
to
accomplish
his
ruin
those
above
not
shotaye
not
the
tehuas
had
vanquished
him
and
against
them
it
was
useless
to
strive
with
a
ghastly
look
of
terror
on
his
countenance
his
eyes
staring
in
uncontrollable
fright
tyope
slowly
receded
mentally
crushed
shivering
and
shuddering
he
at
last
turned
about
and
fled
the
conviction
that
he
was
henceforth
utterly
powerless
had
seized
upon
him
like
an
utter
coward
unmindful
of
his
rank
and
duties
and
bent
only
upon
saving
his
life
tyope
ran
and
ran
until
he
found
himself
in
the
midst
of
the
slaughter
he
had
mechanically
warded
off
some
arrows
which
the
enemy
had
shot
at
his
rapidly
approaching
figure
but
he
passed
in
among
friends
and
foes
heedless
of
both
until
his
mad
career
was
stayed
by
the
brink
of
the
cañada
ancha
in
the
course
of
the
massacre
the
queres
had
succeeded
in
breaking
partly
through
the
enemy
and
gathering
on
the
south
thus
securing
a
line
of
retreat
or
at
least
escape
from
the
bloody
trap
tyope
had
reached
that
point
without
knowing
well
whither
he
was
fleeing
the
sight
of
the
ravine
at
his
feet
stopped
him
he
looked
around
at
first
then
little
by
little
returned
a
man
came
up
to
him
he
was
covered
with
blood
a
drum
was
suspended
from
his
shoulder
it
was
the
hishtanyi
chayan
how
is
everything
tyope
gasped
where
have
you
been
the
shaman
asked
in
a
tone
of
stern
reproach
i
was
cut
off
and
had
to
hide
tyope
flared
up
the
manner
of
the
questioner
irritated
him
and
with
his
anger
a
portion
of
his
former
energy
seemed
to
return
do
you
not
know
that
the
should
carry
the
life
of
his
men
upon
his
own
heart
and
care
for
them
more
than
for
himself
that
he
should
not
hunt
for
scalps
in
the
rear
of
the
enemy
as
shutzuna
follows
a
herd
of
buffaloes
to
eat
a
fallen
calf
the
chayan
hissed
and
you
tyope
roared
do
you
not
know
that
you
should
speak
the
truth
to
the
people
not
say
that
the
shiuana
are
good
that
they
say
it
is
well
while
the
kopishtai
and
the
shuatyam
go
over
to
the
enemy
together
to
help
him
you
are
a
liar
you
lie
like
a
dinne
you
are
foolish
like
a
prairie
dog
when
shutzuna
plays
before
him
it
was
tyope
last
effort
at
passion
he
nearly
cried
from
rage
as
he
brandished
his
in
the
face
of
the
shaman
the
latter
remained
calm
and
spoke
not
a
word
merely
fastening
on
the
maddened
raving
man
a
cold
stern
glance
heedless
of
his
threats
and
insults
he
commanded
hush
tyope
hush
if
the
evil
ones
are
about
us
it
is
because
they
have
followed
along
from
the
tyuonyi
hush
i
say
do
your
duty
at
last
at
the
tyuonyi
if
we
ever
get
there
we
shall
see
further
at
this
moment
several
queres
burst
from
the
timber
one
of
them
cried
to
tyope
nashtio
the
moshome
are
too
strong
they
are
coming
to
kill
you
and
all
of
us
we
must
away
into
the
karitya
and
with
this
he
leaped
from
the
brink
he
had
selected
a
spot
where
the
rim
was
precipitous
for
a
short
distance
over
he
went
a
cry
of
anguish
and
of
helpless
despair
was
heard
then
followed
a
series
of
thuds
as
though
a
heavy
body
were
falling
from
step
to
step
from
the
depths
below
a
faint
moaning
arose
then
all
was
still
the
din
and
noise
of
the
battle
was
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
soon
more
of
the
queres
rushed
out
and
would
in
their
precipitate
flight
have
followed
the
example
of
their
comrade
had
not
others
coming
up
behind
them
held
them
back
regardless
of
the
danger
they
clustered
together
on
the
brink
and
gazed
at
the
shattered
mangled
gory
mass
beneath
which
was
once
the
body
of
one
of
their
companions
the
words
of
the
shaman
fell
upon
tyope
like
another
blow
from
above
they
cowed
him
to
avoid
the
gaze
which
the
old
man
fastened
upon
him
still
he
turned
to
fly
no
longer
a
warrior
no
longer
the
commander
he
was
partly
imbecile
and
absolutely
cowed
he
trembled
but
the
shaman
seized
his
arm
and
restrained
him
pointing
to
the
men
he
said
save
these
if
you
can
tyope
obeyed
for
he
had
no
longer
a
will
of
his
own
he
cast
a
vacant
glance
about
but
arrows
whistled
from
the
timber
the
tehuas
were
coming
the
queres
ran
along
the
brink
to
look
for
a
descent
there
was
no
stopping
them
no
possibility
of
restoring
order
every
one
looked
out
for
himself
tyope
cast
a
pleading
glance
at
the
old
man
by
his
side
and
the
chayan
felt
that
he
must
henceforth
do
what
was
yet
to
be
done
seeing
the
queres
clambering
down
into
the
gorge
in
wild
haste
and
that
others
were
still
rushing
out
of
the
thickets
he
caught
tyope
by
the
shoulder
and
drew
him
along
saying
in
a
milder
tone
follow
me
sa
uishe
he
pitied
the
crestfallen
man
henceforth
it
was
the
who
assumed
the
lead
tyope
gathering
energy
enough
to
act
as
his
lieutenant
the
shaman
was
but
a
mediocre
warrior
still
in
this
dismal
hour
he
was
the
only
salvation
of
the
remaining
queres
not
one
half
of
their
number
succeeded
in
reaching
the
bottom
of
the
cañada
ancha
and
taking
shelter
in
the
groves
of
tall
pines
that
dot
the
vale
it
was
an
anxious
time
for
those
who
had
already
found
safety
behind
trees
when
they
saw
the
stragglers
rush
down
the
rugged
slope
and
tear
through
the
thickets
followed
by
the
tehuas
who
crowded
along
the
brink
in
greatly
superior
numbers
yelling
shooting
arrows
and
waving
triumphantly
the
many
many
scalps
they
had
taken
a
few
of
their
skirmishers
descended
some
distance
but
the
main
pursuit
was
stayed
by
strict
orders
from
the
tehua
as
soon
as
the
first
group
of
fugitives
among
them
hishtanyi
and
tyope
had
reached
the
bottom
of
the
cañada
the
shaman
arrested
their
farther
flight
prevailing
upon
them
to
make
a
stand
their
position
was
temporarily
a
good
one
no
approach
was
possible
without
exposing
the
assailant
to
whereas
the
defenders
were
thoroughly
protected
as
their
numbers
increased
by
accessions
from
those
who
had
also
been
able
to
extricate
themselves
their
courage
returned
and
they
willingly
remained
until
the
time
came
when
the
shaman
and
tyope
by
his
command
should
direct
farther
retreat
the
leaders
of
the
tehuas
saw
this
and
desisted
from
an
attempt
at
complete
extermination
it
would
have
cost
them
dearly
and
would
only
have
increased
the
number
of
their
trophies
so
the
tehuas
remained
above
the
gorge
displaying
a
threatening
front
while
in
reality
the
majority
of
them
returned
home
and
with
them
shotaye
great
was
the
exultation
of
the
woman
when
she
saw
the
triumph
of
her
new
friends
over
her
own
people
she
was
proud
of
this
result
of
her
craftiness
and
her
skill
when
the
engagement
over
she
scanned
the
field
looking
at
the
dead
and
searching
for
tyope
among
them
in
vain
her
disappointment
was
fearful
corpse
after
corpse
she
scrutinized
turning
over
the
ghastly
bodies
peering
into
the
lifeless
features
raising
the
mutilated
heads
to
see
more
closely
more
distinctly
in
vain
tyope
was
not
among
them
tyope
had
escaped
her
revenge
was
sterile
it
had
fallen
on
the
least
guilty
she
too
felt
that
a
higher
hand
must
have
interfered
and
made
her
triumph
next
to
worthless
as
she
scanned
the
bloody
distorted
features
of
the
men
of
her
tribe
in
the
expectation
of
gloating
over
those
of
him
against
whom
she
had
schemed
she
recognized
more
than
one
of
whose
company
she
had
agreeable
recollections
more
than
one
whom
in
her
calculating
way
she
had
made
her
tool
for
a
time
something
like
regret
arose
within
her
regret
at
her
treason
she
went
back
to
the
puye
with
a
sting
in
her
heart
forever
outwardly
she
led
a
contented
life
as
the
consort
of
cayamo
and
the
tehuas
looked
upon
her
as
a
useful
accession
if
not
as
one
who
had
at
one
time
become
the
saviour
of
their
tribe
but
she
could
never
think
of
the
rito
nor
hear
it
mentioned
without
feeling
a
pang
it
was
remorse
but
she
did
not
know
it
never
again
was
she
seen
by
any
of
her
former
people
the
position
in
which
the
queres
had
taken
refuge
was
tenable
only
for
a
short
time
because
the
cañada
ancha
has
no
permanent
there
were
a
few
pools
however
containing
remnants
of
the
rain
that
had
lately
fallen
but
that
was
not
enough
to
abandon
the
groves
in
which
they
felt
comparatively
safe
in
presence
of
the
foe
would
have
been
reckless
so
the
queres
remained
during
the
whole
day
while
the
tehuas
kept
guard
over
them
observing
their
movements
from
the
cover
of
the
timber
on
the
mesa
as
night
set
in
the
hishtanyi
chayan
ordered
a
slow
noiseless
retreat
down
the
cañada
toward
the
rio
grande
tyope
passively
did
what
the
shaman
told
him
he
had
no
longer
a
will
of
his
own
he
who
had
always
judged
others
from
the
standpoint
of
their
usefulness
to
him
as
his
tools
was
now
reduced
mentally
to
be
a
blind
instrument
of
the
man
of
whom
he
expected
to
rid
himself
on
this
very
campaign
all
of
tyope
authority
was
gone
the
men
did
not
reproach
him
did
not
scorn
they
simply
ignored
him
except
when
he
spoke
in
the
name
and
by
direction
of
the
hishtanyi
chayan
the
latter
saw
more
and
more
the
mental
downfall
of
the
and
took
pity
on
him
making
him
his
lieutenant
when
morning
dawned
the
little
troop
halted
on
the
ziro
kauash
they
had
made
a
long
detour
and
now
were
in
dread
lest
the
tehuas
had
prepared
an
ambush
near
home
tyope
himself
was
still
further
concerned
he
who
had
boldly
attempted
to
carry
out
the
most
daring
schemes
was
afraid
of
returning
to
his
people
now
that
these
schemes
had
failed
he
feared
like
a
child
reproach
and
punishment
the
spirit
of
the
man
was
utterly
crushed
when
a
returns
it
never
enters
the
village
directly
but
halts
at
some
distance
and
sends
a
messenger
to
inform
the
people
of
its
approach
the
queres
halted
on
the
ziro
kauash
and
some
of
them
scoured
the
woods
but
no
trace
of
the
enemy
appeared
the
dreaded
ambush
had
not
been
laid
the
tehuas
had
certainly
returned
content
with
victory
and
their
trophies
a
runner
was
sent
to
the
rito
and
the
men
waited
and
waited
even
the
hishtanyi
chayan
became
startled
at
the
long
delay
tyope
squatted
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
he
was
thinking
of
the
reception
that
might
be
in
reserve
for
him
everything
manly
and
strong
had
left
his
heart
nothing
of
it
remained
but
a
languidly
putrid
core
whose
former
fermentation
had
produced
the
effervescence
that
took
the
shape
of
energy
shrewdness
and
daring
at
last
toward
evening
a
man
approached
the
silent
group
he
came
accompanied
by
the
runner
and
every
one
recognized
the
features
of
kauaitshe
the
delegate
from
the
water
clan
he
went
straight
to
tyope
and
the
latter
looked
at
him
timidly
almost
tremblingly
face
looked
sad
and
mournful
but
not
wrathful
he
grasped
the
hand
of
tyope
breathed
on
it
lifted
it
upward
with
both
his
hands
and
said
in
a
tone
of
intense
sorrow
satyumishe
those
above
are
not
kind
to
us
a
terrible
pang
flashed
through
tyope
heart
for
he
had
experienced
how
little
the
shiuana
liked
him
kauaitshe
continued
in
a
low
voice
artless
but
the
more
impressive
for
its
natural
sadness
while
you
went
to
strike
the
tehuas
with
our
men
the
moshome
dinne
came
upon
us
a
shriek
of
dismay
of
terror
issued
from
every
one
present
tyope
excepted
he
only
groaned
and
sinking
shrivelled
pressed
down
his
chest
against
his
knees
as
if
suffering
intense
physical
pain
he
recalled
his
intrigues
with
the
young
navajo
this
last
blow
to
the
tribe
was
his
work
also
in
a
monotonous
voice
the
messenger
of
evil
tidings
proceeded
my
hanutsh
is
no
more
tanyi
hanutsh
is
dispersed
scattered
fleeing
through
the
timber
of
mokatsh
hanutsh
only
one
girl
has
remained
alive
of
tyame
a
few
women
but
your
wife
satyumishe
is
dead
your
child
mitsha
the
moshome
have
carried
away
or
else
she
hides
in
the
timber
and
starves
the
great
house
is
empty
and
fire
comes
out
from
its
roof
your
people
can
have
the
field
of
tzitz
hanutsh
he
added
with
trembling
voice
we
need
it
no
longer
but
your
clan
has
land
enough
now
for
many
of
the
men
of
shyuamo
have
gone
over
to
shipapu
he
dropped
tyope
hand
wiped
away
the
tears
that
were
forcing
themselves
to
his
eyes
and
stood
in
silence
not
one
of
the
bystanders
moved
the
hishtanyi
chayan
lifted
his
eyes
to
the
sky
tyope
stared
vacantly
he
seemed
to
stagger
the
delegate
from
the
water
clan
grasped
his
hand
again
and
said
come
and
see
how
the
shiuana
have
visited
the
tyuonyi
chapter
xix
it
is
contrary
to
the
custom
of
the
indians
for
a
to
enter
their
village
at
once
upon
returning
for
at
least
one
day
the
warriors
must
wait
at
some
distance
from
the
pueblo
they
are
provided
with
the
necessaries
of
life
and
afterward
are
conducted
to
the
village
in
triumph
in
the
present
case
all
these
formalities
were
neglected
but
not
through
spite
or
disapproval
the
terrible
visitation
which
the
rito
had
suffered
changed
everything
the
survivors
of
the
queres
were
anxious
to
have
their
numbers
increased
by
the
returning
warriors
mechanically
tyope
accompanied
his
guide
the
warriors
followed
in
sullen
silence
the
hishtanyi
chayan
alone
holding
his
head
erect
the
visitation
from
above
affected
him
least
of
all
no
one
asked
about
the
details
of
the
navajos
attack
but
all
feared
the
moment
when
their
valley
homes
should
come
in
sight
as
they
neared
the
brink
of
the
gorge
many
lagged
behind
tyope
was
filled
with
thoughts
of
the
most
dismal
nature
he
felt
wretched
crushed
almost
distracted
the
news
brought
by
kauaitshe
weighed
him
down
in
a
manner
that
allowed
neither
hope
or
quietude
his
plans
had
become
realized
but
how
the
loss
of
his
wife
he
hardly
felt
so
much
the
more
did
he
regret
mitsha
disappearance
but
far
above
all
this
loomed
up
the
terrible
consequences
less
of
the
defeat
than
of
the
blow
which
the
navajos
following
the
instructions
he
had
once
given
nacaytzusle
had
struck
during
his
absence
he
had
done
most
toward
bringing
about
the
expedition
to
the
puye
therefore
he
had
led
the
flower
of
the
tribe
into
perdition
during
his
absence
and
that
of
the
majority
of
its
defenders
the
navajos
had
executed
the
fatal
surprise
he
had
often
been
reproached
with
his
intimacy
with
the
young
dinne
and
while
the
savage
remained
at
the
rito
everybody
knew
that
the
boy
was
a
favourite
of
his
what
else
could
the
caciques
the
leading
shamans
infer
but
that
the
savage
had
been
able
to
select
his
time
and
that
he
tyope
had
betrayed
the
tribe
to
the
dinne
and
the
worst
of
it
was
it
was
true
he
had
at
one
time
suggested
the
plan
and
had
abandoned
it
afterward
as
too
dangerous
he
had
suggested
it
with
the
view
of
furthering
his
personal
ends
now
its
execution
took
place
when
he
least
expected
it
and
when
the
very
event
which
he
had
prepared
for
his
benefit
struck
the
most
crushing
blow
he
could
ever
have
imagined
possible
for
him
to
have
suffered
had
tyope
returned
from
the
campaign
victorious
it
might
have
been
different
but
now
the
shiuana
bore
down
upon
him
with
crushing
power
there
was
no
hope
nor
thought
of
his
ever
rising
again
the
best
he
could
expect
was
to
be
set
aside
forever
as
a
broken
useless
unfortunate
but
the
koshare
still
remained
and
they
would
not
forsake
him
in
the
hour
of
need
the
naua
if
alive
would
certainly
not
permit
his
utter
ruin
the
two
conspirators
had
prevailed
upon
the
hishtanyi
so
that
only
a
few
of
the
delight
makers
accompanied
the
of
these
two
or
three
had
escaped
how
had
the
majority
fared
that
majority
which
remained
at
the
rito
for
prudence
sake
tyope
dared
not
ask
questions
he
went
along
mutely
as
if
in
a
dream
the
hishtanyi
chayan
stopped
kauaitshe
and
asked
him
have
any
of
my
brethren
the
yaya
suffered
tyope
heart
throbbed
and
he
turned
his
face
away
so
fearful
was
he
of
the
reply
the
shkuy
chayan
replied
kauaitshe
in
his
simple
manner
is
dead
an
arrow
entered
his
eye
tyope
shivered
misfortune
crowded
upon
misfortune
he
could
no
longer
resist
inquiring
panting
he
asked
is
our
father
the
naua
still
alive
he
lives
and
mourns
after
you
were
gone
with
the
people
he
retired
to
the
place
in
the
cliffs
with
the
koshare
and
when
the
moshome
came
nearly
all
the
men
were
up
there
tyope
head
was
swimming
everything
he
had
prepared
for
the
destruction
of
others
and
the
security
of
his
own
tools
had
come
about
as
he
had
schemed
but
the
results
had
been
fatal
to
him
and
his
the
shiuana
allowed
him
to
apparently
succeed
in
everything
but
they
reserved
for
themselves
the
final
results
it
was
terrible
all
was
lost
he
was
forever
undone
still
if
the
koshare
had
been
at
their
estufa
they
were
out
of
way
satyumishe
he
asked
faltering
have
many
of
my
brethren
perished
nearly
all
was
the
plain
answer
when
the
dinne
came
upon
us
the
koshare
rushed
out
after
bows
and
arrows
but
the
moshome
met
them
before
they
could
reach
the
houses
and
killed
many
before
they
could
get
into
the
cave
the
poor
man
had
to
cling
to
a
tree
for
support
then
he
slipped
down
along
its
trunk
to
the
ground
i
am
very
tired
he
murmured
it
was
not
fatigue
however
it
was
the
ghastly
tidings
which
were
poured
on
his
head
so
slowly
so
surely
with
such
deadly
effect
kauaitshe
looked
at
him
with
genuine
pity
the
hishtanyi
said
nothing
he
was
in
his
thoughts
with
those
above
and
hardly
listened
to
the
conversation
kauaitshe
extended
his
hand
to
tyope
we
are
not
far
from
the
brink
said
he
kindly
come
satyumishe
a
few
steps
only
and
you
may
rest
and
i
will
tell
you
all
how
the
attack
came
and
how
hayoue
saved
the
zaashtesh
from
being
all
driven
into
the
woods
hayoue
is
a
mighty
warrior
he
is
wise
and
very
strong
as
soon
as
our
mourning
is
over
the
hotshanyi
will
make
him
maseua
in
place
of
our
father
topanashka
the
shiuana
have
left
us
hayoue
had
he
gone
with
you
not
one
of
us
would
be
alive
even
that
hayoue
hayoue
whom
tyope
had
left
behind
in
order
to
deprive
him
of
all
opportunity
to
distinguish
himself
hayoue
had
reaped
laurels
whereas
he
had
harvested
only
shame
disgrace
destruction
hayoue
was
a
great
warrior
he
had
averted
a
part
at
least
of
the
disaster
which
tyope
had
secretly
prepared
for
the
tribe
the
hand
of
those
above
weighed
heavily
upon
him
all
he
cared
for
henceforth
all
he
could
hope
for
was
not
to
suffer
the
rightful
doom
which
he
had
intended
for
shotaye
that
kauaitshe
the
poor
simple
man
whom
he
so
disdainfully
rebuked
at
the
council
had
been
selected
to
communicate
to
tyope
all
this
crushing
news
the
latter
did
not
interpret
as
an
intentional
cruelty
the
indian
is
not
malicious
he
will
insult
and
exult
over
the
vanquished
foe
in
the
heat
of
passion
but
he
will
take
the
scalp
and
keep
it
very
carefully
respect
it
and
to
a
certain
extent
the
memory
of
the
slain
but
to
sneer
at
and
taunt
a
fallen
adversary
in
the
hour
of
sadness
and
in
the
condition
in
which
tyope
was
is
not
the
indian
way
that
was
not
what
made
tyope
suffer
what
overpowered
his
faculties
darkened
his
mind
and
deprived
him
of
energy
for
all
time
to
come
were
the
results
that
crowded
upon
him
so
wonderfully
so
completely
at
variance
with
his
own
intentions
and
yet
they
were
strictly
the
consequences
of
what
he
had
schemed
and
done
everything
he
had
thought
of
and
planned
had
taken
place
but
the
results
did
not
coincide
with
his
expectations
those
above
alone
could
have
directed
the
course
of
events
they
were
against
his
doings
he
was
a
doomed
man
the
reader
will
forgive
a
digression
we
will
leave
tyope
and
his
companions
on
the
brink
of
the
rito
and
abandon
them
for
a
while
to
their
sombre
thoughts
nay
we
will
leave
the
rito
even
and
transport
ourselves
to
our
own
day
i
desire
to
relate
a
story
an
indian
tale
of
modern
origin
which
is
authentic
in
so
far
that
it
was
told
me
by
an
indian
friend
years
ago
at
the
village
of
cochiti
where
the
descendants
of
those
who
once
upon
a
time
inhabited
the
caves
on
the
rito
de
los
frijoles
now
live
my
object
in
rehearsing
this
tale
is
to
explain
something
i
have
neglected
namely
the
real
conception
underlying
the
custom
of
taking
the
scalp
of
an
enemy
the
indian
friend
of
whom
i
am
speaking
and
whose
home
i
inhabited
for
quite
a
while
came
over
to
the
little
dingy
room
i
was
occupying
one
winter
evening
the
fire
was
burning
in
a
chimney
not
much
better
than
the
one
shotaye
possessed
at
the
tyuonyi
he
squatted
down
on
his
folded
blanket
rolled
a
cigarette
and
looked
at
me
wistfully
i
felt
that
he
was
disposed
for
a
long
talk
and
returned
his
glance
with
one
of
eager
expectation
casting
his
eyes
to
the
ground
he
asked
me
you
know
that
the
navajos
have
done
us
much
harm
yes
you
and
your
brother
shtiranyi
have
told
me
so
he
curled
his
lip
at
the
reference
to
his
brother
knowledge
and
said
sneeringly
shtiranyi
is
young
he
does
not
know
much
still
he
told
me
a
great
deal
about
the
wars
you
had
with
the
moshome
dinne
did
he
ever
tell
you
of
the
hard
times
the
people
of
cochiti
suffered
three
generations
ago
never
he
knows
nothing
of
them
he
is
too
young
i
he
assumed
an
air
of
solemn
importance
i
will
tell
you
something
something
true
something
that
you
can
believe
for
the
old
men
those
from
a
long
time
ago
tell
it
and
what
they
say
is
so
the
mexicans
never
hear
of
it
and
to
the
americans
we
do
tell
such
things
for
they
think
they
are
too
smart
and
laugh
at
what
we
say
is
the
story
really
true
i
inquired
for
i
saw
that
something
interesting
was
coming
as
true
as
if
i
had
seen
it
myself
but
i
was
not
born
when
it
happened
cochiti
was
larger
then
a
big
village
twice
as
big
as
it
is
but
the
navajos
were
very
powerful
they
attacked
us
in
the
daytime
in
the
fields
they
killed
the
men
who
went
to
gather
firewood
and
they
stole
our
cattle
at
night
they
would
come
to
the
zaashtesh
and
carry
off
the
women
and
the
girls
there
lived
at
the
time
a
young
koitza
who
had
recently
married
and
she
liked
her
husband
one
evening
after
dark
this
woman
went
to
the
corral
there
the
moshome
seized
her
closed
her
mouth
with
their
hands
dragged
her
from
the
village
tied
and
gagged
her
and
placed
her
on
a
horse
then
they
rode
off
as
fast
as
they
could
far
far
away
to
the
northwest
and
the
hogans
of
their
people
the
young
woman
cried
bitterly
but
it
availed
her
nothing
she
had
to
live
with
one
of
the
navajos
had
to
cook
for
him
and
work
his
like
other
women
soon
the
koitza
saw
that
it
was
useless
to
weep
so
she
put
on
a
contented
look
in
the
daytime
while
at
night
she
was
thinking
and
scheming
how
she
might
escape
from
the
enemy
women
are
sometimes
wiser
than
we
are
ourselves
is
it
not
so
sa
ukinyi
certainly
it
was
springtime
when
she
was
captured
she
suffered
summer
to
pass
worked
well
and
appeared
satisfied
the
moshome
began
to
trust
and
even
to
like
her
it
began
to
turn
cool
the
time
came
when
the
piñons
are
ready
for
gathering
and
the
captive
thought
of
flight
one
morning
she
said
to
a
young
woman
of
the
navajos
us
go
and
gather
piñon
both
women
went
to
work
and
prepared
food
for
several
days
then
they
went
out
into
the
timber
far
away
until
they
came
to
a
place
where
there
were
many
there
they
gathered
nuts
and
placed
them
on
the
blankets
and
as
came
on
and
it
became
warm
the
young
navajo
woman
grew
sleepy
so
the
koitza
from
cochiti
said
lay
your
head
on
my
lap
i
will
cleanse
your
hair
as
the
other
was
lying
thus
and
the
queres
woman
cleansed
her
head
she
fell
asleep
thereupon
the
captive
took
a
large
stone
crushed
her
skull
with
it
and
killed
her
was
not
that
very
wise
indeed
i
uttered
but
thought
to
myself
that
the
action
was
not
very
praiseworthy
from
our
point
of
view
then
our
koitza
took
a
knife
scalped
the
dead
and
concealed
the
scalp
under
her
skirt
it
was
now
toward
evening
all
at
once
the
woman
heard
a
voice
calling
to
her
she
was
frightened
and
looked
about
but
saw
nobody
she
lay
down
again
a
voice
spoke
close
to
her
stay
here
no
longer
they
are
uneasy
nothing
was
to
be
seen
and
the
woman
began
to
feel
afraid
for
the
third
time
the
same
voice
said
not
fear
sister
it
is
i
the
ahtzeta
which
speaks
to
thee
go
now
for
the
men
are
saddling
their
horses
to
look
for
us
the
captive
gathered
hastily
as
much
food
as
she
could
carry
with
ease
and
as
the
sun
went
down
the
scalp
spoke
again
is
time
to
go
for
my
people
are
on
their
way
hither
and
it
is
far
to
cochiti
so
she
ran
and
ran
all
the
night
long
and
always
straight
toward
our
pueblo
toward
morning
she
felt
tired
and
the
scalp
spoke
down
to
rest
it
is
far
yet
to
your
people
she
slept
but
soon
woke
again
feeling
fresh
and
bright
then
the
ahtzeta
said
to
her
us
go
now
for
soon
the
dinne
will
be
where
you
took
me
and
where
i
became
yours
on
she
ran
eating
piñons
as
she
went
at
noon
the
scalp
was
heard
to
say
men
have
found
the
place
and
are
searching
for
your
tracks
you
must
go
faster
when
the
sun
set
the
ahtzeta
spoke
again
sister
they
have
found
the
trail
and
follow
it
on
horseback
thus
she
went
all
night
long
and
the
nearer
she
came
to
cochiti
the
more
the
scalp
urged
her
to
quicken
her
speed
for
the
navajos
were
coming
nearer
and
nearer
you
know
asked
he
where
the
are
a
little
this
side
of
cuapa
i
assented
that
whole
track
is
nothing
but
sand
and
drift
but
which
particular
hills
he
meant
i
could
not
of
course
imagine
still
the
indian
knows
every
foot
of
the
country
and
he
supposed
that
i
having
been
over
the
trail
two
or
three
times
recollected
every
detail
of
it
as
well
as
he
did
himself
you
know
also
that
there
are
junipers
right
there
such
was
indeed
the
case
not
only
there
but
all
over
the
country
well
there
about
two
leagues
from
cochiti
the
scalp
spoke
they
are
quite
near
hide
yourself
the
woman
looked
around
but
she
saw
no
other
except
the
junipers
you
know
them
they
are
to
the
left
of
the
trail
i
nodded
of
course
there
are
a
great
many
to
the
left
of
the
trail
then
the
scalp
told
her
into
a
under
the
tree
you
know
the
hole
do
you
i
said
yes
to
this
query
also
around
cochiti
there
are
perhaps
hundreds
of
and
it
might
have
been
one
of
those
although
after
a
full
century
a
rabbit
hole
is
not
supposed
to
be
apparent
the
narrator
was
satisfied
nevertheless
for
i
had
assented
it
is
well
but
as
the
woman
looked
at
that
hole
she
was
frightened
and
replied
is
too
small
into
it
ordered
the
scalp
can
not
even
get
my
head
into
it
objected
the
koitza
from
cochiti
in
quick
they
come
the
scalp
cried
the
woman
tried
and
the
opening
became
larger
and
larger
first
she
found
room
for
her
head
afterward
for
her
shoulders
lastly
her
whole
body
was
inside
as
soon
as
she
was
within
the
hole
closed
again
and
appeared
as
small
as
before
was
not
that
wonderful
i
thought
it
was
strange
indeed
exceedingly
wonderful
i
could
not
refrain
from
asking
my
friend
but
was
it
really
so
so
the
old
men
are
telling
those
from
many
years
ago
it
must
be
true
therefore
do
disturb
me
in
my
speech
and
listen
the
navajos
came
on
they
saw
that
the
tracks
stopped
they
jumped
from
their
horses
and
the
woman
heard
them
go
about
searching
complaining
howling
scolding
at
last
they
mounted
their
horses
again
and
rode
off
when
all
was
quiet
the
scalp
spoke
they
have
gone
get
out
now
and
let
us
return
to
your
people
with
this
the
hole
opened
the
woman
crept
out
and
ran
and
ran
as
fast
as
she
could
when
she
reached
the
cañada
de
la
peralta
the
scalp
spoke
for
the
last
time
saying
to
her
now
you
are
safe
henceforth
i
shall
speak
no
more
and
so
it
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
ravine
stood
her
own
husband
he
recognized
her
at
once
they
went
together
to
the
houses
where
she
lived
for
many
years
he
paused
and
looked
at
me
scanning
my
face
to
see
the
impression
made
by
his
tale
then
he
continued
you
see
now
sa
uishe
how
the
scalp
saved
her
to
whom
it
belonged
therefore
we
take
ahtzeta
for
as
long
as
the
spirit
is
not
at
shipapu
it
follows
him
who
has
taken
the
scalp
and
serves
and
helps
him
and
the
strength
wisdom
and
knowledge
of
him
whose
scalp
has
been
taken
hereafter
belong
to
the
man
who
took
it
they
increase
his
power
and
make
the
tribe
more
powerful
the
appearance
of
the
rito
from
above
presented
at
first
sight
nothing
startling
from
the
tall
building
thin
films
of
smoke
arose
but
no
flames
were
visible
the
house
of
the
corn
clan
seemed
inhabited
for
people
stood
on
its
roof
as
the
returning
warriors
grouped
themselves
on
the
brink
to
look
down
into
the
valley
those
below
stood
still
gazing
at
them
then
they
broke
out
into
a
plaintive
wail
the
women
tore
their
hair
shrieked
screamed
and
wept
the
men
above
gazed
and
listened
in
silence
very
few
men
were
seen
in
the
vale
the
tribe
of
the
queres
seemed
divided
into
two
parties
the
women
lamenting
below
the
men
like
dark
statues
standing
high
above
them
posted
on
yellowish
rocks
among
the
shrubbery
kauaitshe
told
tyope
to
rest
and
he
willingly
complied
his
figure
appeared
less
conspicuous
when
he
sat
down
around
the
two
the
others
gathered
except
the
hishtanyi
who
was
slowly
descending
the
slope
alone
eager
to
hear
the
story
of
the
people
misfortunes
kauaitshe
began
it
was
yesterday
and
the
sun
had
not
yet
come
up
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
all
the
koshare
were
in
the
estufa
over
there
he
pointed
at
the
cliffs
to
his
right
the
makatza
and
our
koitza
were
grinding
corn
many
also
had
gone
to
the
brook
to
wash
away
sadness
and
grief
most
of
them
mainly
those
of
tanyi
huashpa
and
our
women
bathed
higher
up
beyond
the
fields
some
farther
down
shotaye
was
not
among
them
nobody
knows
what
has
become
of
her
tyope
twitched
nervously
he
knew
where
the
woman
had
gone
hayoue
the
man
from
tzitz
proceeded
was
the
only
one
who
carried
weapons
he
had
gone
out
very
early
with
okoya
the
youth
from
tanyi
who
is
his
brother
child
they
had
started
while
it
was
yet
night
following
the
tshinaya
up
to
the
top
of
the
rocks
as
soon
as
it
became
light
they
noticed
tracks
and
heard
sounds
that
told
them
that
there
were
moshome
about
they
went
around
by
the
south
and
as
it
began
to
dawn
they
stood
there
he
pointed
to
a
spot
on
the
southern
mesa
directly
opposite
the
big
house
and
facing
the
latter
that
saved
us
he
cried
if
hayoue
had
not
stood
there
to
watch
we
should
all
have
died
tyope
could
not
help
contrasting
the
watchfulness
of
hayoue
with
his
own
supercilious
negligence
yes
indeed
it
was
all
over
with
him
he
was
good
for
nothing
any
more
i
was
in
the
katityam
kauaitshe
went
on
when
i
heard
the
yells
of
the
savages
in
the
corn
below
they
had
concealed
themselves
there
over
night
and
as
soon
as
the
people
came
forth
from
their
homes
unarmed
not
thinking
of
any
danger
they
rushed
upon
them
and
into
the
big
house
i
grasped
uishtyak
and
the
club
and
ran
for
the
stream
there
everybody
was
screaming
some
were
running
this
way
others
fled
that
way
but
none
could
get
back
to
the
cliffs
none
into
the
houses
for
the
moshome
stood
between
them
and
their
homes
they
fled
toward
the
south
into
the
kote
as
a
mountain
sheep
runs
from
the
panther
but
as
tyame
shoots
down
upon
a
hind
so
the
enemies
flew
after
them
scattering
them
in
every
direction
all
this
happened
so
quickly
brother
that
i
was
not
half
way
down
when
it
was
over
and
a
few
of
the
dinne
rushed
up
to
kill
me
they
were
going
to
the
caves
to
slaughter
the
people
i
ran
back
and
hid
myself
and
as
they
came
up
i
shot
at
one
of
them
so
that
he
died
the
cuirana
naua
killed
another
the
others
ran
away
we
took
their
ahtzeta
and
kept
guard
over
the
caves
but
for
what
there
was
nobody
left
of
tzitz
hanutsh
except
a
few
old
women
and
ciay
tihua
the
little
boy
go
down
we
could
not
for
below
was
such
a
noise
such
fighting
struggling
shouting
and
wailing
the
moshome
tore
the
firebrands
from
the
hearths
set
fire
to
the
beams
dragged
the
cloth
and
the
hides
into
the
and
burned
them
there
fire
came
out
of
the
big
house
and
great
was
the
smoke
and
black
in
the
smoke
we
could
see
how
the
shuatyam
were
dancing
on
the
roofs
and
how
they
threw
the
dead
down
upon
the
ground
so
that
their
bodies
rattled
and
the
blood
spurted
and
spattered
everywhere
satyumishe
it
was
sad
very
sad
but
i
could
not
help
nor
could
the
naua
for
we
were
alone
still
i
have
one
scalp
he
added
with
simple
satisfaction
hayoue
has
many
many
how
many
have
you
brought
home
tyope
cast
his
eyes
to
the
ground
none
he
breathed
he
could
not
conceal
his
contrition
and
shame
kauaitshe
made
no
remark
he
was
not
malicious
from
the
great
house
they
ran
into
that
of
tyame
hanutsh
there
they
killed
your
wife
and
mitsha
my
daughter
tyope
asked
at
last
mitsha
was
at
the
brook
and
fled
with
the
others
nacaytzusle
the
fiend
was
after
her
to
catch
her
but
he
caught
her
not
hayoue
told
us
afterward
that
okoya
tihua
killed
the
savage
just
as
he
had
overtaken
the
girl
okoya
is
strong
and
good
he
will
become
a
great
warrior
like
sa
umo
the
maseua
that
is
if
he
still
live
at
last
a
ray
of
light
seemed
to
penetrate
the
darkness
that
shrouded
tyope
heart
nacaytzusle
was
dead
the
dangerous
accomplice
the
only
one
who
might
have
told
about
tyope
attempted
conspiracy
with
the
navajos
was
forever
silenced
he
felt
relieved
also
to
think
that
mitsha
had
not
become
a
prey
to
the
savage
and
it
pleased
him
to
hear
okoya
praised
if
the
youth
had
still
been
at
the
rito
he
might
have
become
a
support
for
him
where
is
okoya
he
anxiously
inquired
in
the
mountains
or
dead
was
the
reply
when
the
women
fled
up
to
the
mesa
hayoue
and
okoya
ran
to
meet
them
but
the
moshome
were
too
many
and
the
two
became
separated
okoya
killed
the
shuatyam
the
navajo
boy
he
went
close
to
him
and
struck
him
with
his
club
till
he
died
so
hayoue
says
hayoue
remained
behind
he
kept
back
the
dinne
and
then
came
down
through
the
enemy
how
i
do
not
know
and
protected
the
katityam
helping
the
koshare
all
the
moshome
who
entered
the
house
of
the
eagles
twelve
of
them
were
killed
inside
their
scalps
are
with
us
and
when
the
others
saw
it
they
ran
out
of
the
big
house
but
hayoue
and
the
men
followed
and
killed
nine
ere
they
could
hide
on
the
kauash
so
you
have
taken
many
ahtzeta
one
of
the
bystanders
asked
kauaitshe
began
to
count
eleven
two
twelve
nine
he
concluded
adding
without
those
that
okoya
may
have
if
he
be
alive
an
exclamation
of
admiration
and
a
grunt
of
satisfaction
sounded
from
the
lips
of
those
present
but
they
became
silent
and
sad
again
at
once
for
they
the
warriors
had
only
eight
or
nine
all
told
kauaitshe
pride
and
exultation
could
not
last
long
he
bethought
himself
of
the
losses
and
continued
in
a
tone
of
sadness
but
we
have
lost
many
many
nearly
one
hundred
of
our
people
have
gone
over
to
shipapu
and
twice
as
many
are
now
in
the
woods
hungry
and
forlorn
or
the
moshome
have
taken
them
with
them
luckily
they
are
mostly
women
hardly
more
than
twenty
of
the
men
can
have
died
for
it
may
be
that
okoya
is
still
alive
of
these
sixteen
were
koshare
and
the
shkuy
chayan
is
no
more
he
cast
a
glance
of
sincere
pity
at
tyope
the
latter
said
nothing
and
all
the
others
stared
in
mournful
silence
the
lamentations
below
had
gone
on
uninterruptedly
corpses
might
be
seen
lying
on
the
roofs
others
partly
hanging
down
over
the
walls
two
men
were
carrying
a
dead
body
toward
the
caves
of
the
turquoise
people
in
the
distance
a
group
was
seen
dragging
another
corpse
up
the
gorge
below
the
house
of
yakka
hanutsh
there
stood
a
group
of
men
their
faces
turned
toward
the
brink
of
the
mesa
the
nashtio
of
the
water
clan
rose
and
pointed
at
the
group
there
stand
hayoue
the
shikama
chayan
the
three
yaya
the
hotshanyi
shaykatze
and
uishtyaka
and
see
the
hishtanyi
chayan
is
down
on
the
tyuonyi
already
and
goes
up
to
them
let
us
go
now
and
he
turned
to
tyope
you
brother
tell
us
what
you
have
achieved
and
how
you
all
have
fared
we
can
not
receive
you
as
it
behooves
us
there
is
too
much
mourning
on
the
tyuonyi
the
shiuana
have
punished
us
so
that
we
can
not
be
merry
and
glad
therefore
i
have
been
sent
to
receive
you
for
the
men
are
few
in
the
vale
and
he
looked
around
as
if
counting
the
bystanders
of
those
that
went
out
to
avenge
the
death
of
our
father
not
many
have
come
back
either
in
dreary
silence
they
began
to
move
downward
not
a
shout
not
a
whoop
heralded
their
coming
not
a
scalp
was
waved
on
high
in
triumph
in
dead
silence
those
below
watched
the
sombre
forms
as
they
descended
slowly
clambering
over
rocks
rustling
through
bushes
and
coming
nearer
and
nearer
from
the
caves
issued
plaintive
wails
from
the
big
house
moans
and
subdued
crying
ascended
the
lament
over
the
dead
on
the
rito
more
than
a
week
has
elapsed
since
the
return
of
the
discomfited
to
their
desolate
and
ravished
homes
it
is
august
and
the
rains
have
fallen
abundantly
what
little
was
left
of
the
growing
crops
what
the
torrent
has
not
destroyed
and
the
navajos
did
not
lay
waste
looks
promising
but
this
remainder
is
slight
and
there
is
anxiety
lest
the
surviving
inhabitants
may
starve
in
the
dreary
winter
the
formalities
of
mourning
have
therefore
been
performed
hastily
and
superficially
the
remaining
koshare
have
retired
into
the
round
grotto
there
to
fast
and
to
pray
for
the
safe
maturity
of
the
scanty
crops
but
tyope
is
not
among
them
his
accomplice
the
naua
has
forsaken
him
he
too
has
become
convinced
that
everything
is
lost
for
them
and
he
has
thrown
away
tyope
like
a
blunt
and
useless
tool
hereafter
the
naua
attends
strictly
to
his
official
duties
and
to
nothing
beyond
his
duties
for
the
shkuy
chayan
is
dead
the
shikama
chayan
has
no
love
for
him
and
the
old
hishtanyi
who
has
seen
more
of
the
real
nature
of
events
than
any
on
the
rito
went
over
to
the
cave
of
the
old
sinner
and
spake
to
him
a
few
words
the
old
sinner
comprehended
he
has
gone
back
to
his
duties
and
attends
to
them
exclusively
afterward
the
chayan
called
upon
the
chief
penitent
or
hotshanyi
and
spoke
to
him
long
and
earnestly
after
him
to
the
shaykatze
and
the
uishtyaka
lastly
with
all
three
yaya
together
then
the
yaya
went
into
retirement
all
three
in
the
same
place
they
are
fasting
doing
penance
mercilessly
mortifying
themselves
in
order
that
those
above
may
forgive
the
tribe
and
suffer
it
to
prosper
again
all
this
has
taken
place
in
silence
and
secret
and
nothing
has
come
to
the
surface
the
only
thing
that
has
become
public
is
a
general
council
not
merely
of
the
delegates
of
clans
with
the
yaya
but
of
the
tribe
hayoue
assisted
with
zashue
his
brother
tyope
was
present
also
but
he
said
nothing
and
nobody
requested
him
to
speak
he
was
not
outlawed
no
punishment
was
dealt
to
him
he
was
simply
suffered
to
remain
on
that
lower
level
to
which
he
had
naturally
dropped
the
principal
question
agitating
the
council
was
the
nomination
of
a
maseua
or
head
the
caciques
intimated
that
hayoue
would
be
their
choice
and
all
concurred
in
the
selection
but
hayoue
positively
declined
insisting
that
his
clan
had
virtually
ceased
to
exist
on
the
rito
and
that
it
was
his
duty
to
follow
his
people
in
their
distress
zashue
also
spoke
to
the
same
effect
his
wife
say
koitza
and
his
children
had
disappeared
even
to
the
little
girl
whose
brains
were
still
clinging
to
the
walls
of
the
big
house
against
which
the
enemy
had
dashed
her
head
however
much
the
people
insisted
hayoue
remained
firm
in
his
resolve
to
go
after
the
fugitives
and
to
save
them
if
possible
most
of
the
people
thought
them
lost
dead
or
captives
but
both
young
men
were
of
the
opinion
that
there
were
too
many
of
them
and
that
at
least
some
must
have
escaped
it
was
consequently
the
duty
of
the
two
youngest
survivors
to
trace
them
if
possible
the
hishtanyi
chayan
was
the
first
to
accede
to
hayoue
demands
but
conditionally
he
insisted
that
when
their
duties
were
fulfilled
hayoue
and
his
brother
should
return
to
the
rito
with
the
rescued
but
hayoue
refused
to
consent
even
to
this
the
grounds
given
by
him
were
obvious
though
hard
to
listen
to
in
case
they
found
a
few
he
promised
to
return
but
should
there
be
many
yet
alive
he
was
determined
upon
founding
a
new
settlement
he
reproached
the
council
bitterly
for
having
allowed
the
lack
of
arable
soil
to
have
been
taken
as
a
pretext
for
depriving
his
own
small
clan
of
its
allotment
in
order
to
give
it
to
a
larger
one
that
small
clan
should
not
come
back
and
again
be
in
the
way
of
the
others
tzitz
hanutsh
said
he
in
closing
alluding
to
his
own
performances
has
saved
the
tribe
it
has
done
its
duty
now
we
will
go
and
see
whether
our
brethren
and
sisters
are
still
alive
and
in
case
we
find
them
seek
for
another
spot
where
there
will
be
sufficient
room
for
all
every
one
present
did
not
understand
these
words
but
the
members
of
the
council
knew
to
what
the
young
man
was
alluding
and
they
bowed
their
heads
in
shame
even
the
hishtanyi
chayan
felt
the
reproach
for
he
knew
that
it
was
partly
his
fault
since
had
he
followed
the
hint
dropped
by
topanashka
and
his
own
first
impressions
all
might
have
taken
a
different
turn
he
did
not
therefore
insist
any
longer
and
did
not
even
think
it
advisable
to
invoke
the
will
of
those
above
in
aid
of
his
personal
desire
his
silence
determined
the
people
of
the
rito
for
they
took
it
for
granted
that
the
higher
powers
approved
of
resolution
to
leave
it
may
seem
strange
that
the
chayan
did
not
insist
upon
consulting
the
shiuana
first
for
hayoue
would
have
been
compelled
to
abide
by
their
final
decision
here
the
question
arises
how
far
the
indian
shaman
is
sincere
in
his
oracular
utterances
how
much
of
his
decisions
is
honest
error
and
how
much
of
his
official
acts
may
be
deception
or
mere
jugglery
in
most
cases
of
importance
the
shaman
is
honest
he
really
believes
that
what
he
says
is
the
echo
from
a
higher
world
this
firm
belief
is
the
fruit
of
training
and
the
voices
he
hears
the
sights
he
sees
when
alone
with
those
above
are
the
products
of
honest
hallucination
his
training
and
the
long
and
painful
discipline
he
undergoes
in
rising
from
degree
of
knowledge
to
degree
of
knowledge
the
constant
privations
and
bodily
and
mental
tortures
prepare
him
for
a
dreamy
state
in
which
he
becomes
thoroughly
convinced
that
he
really
is
a
medium
as
such
he
speaks
in
council
and
he
is
most
thoroughly
satisfied
that
what
he
says
is
the
truth
of
course
there
are
among
them
some
who
are
rogues
who
profit
by
the
credulity
of
others
and
who
even
invent
tricks
in
order
to
fasten
their
authority
upon
the
people
in
an
illegitimate
manner
these
tricks
themselves
are
not
performed
in
the
majority
of
cases
as
conscious
sleight
of
hand
they
may
have
been
such
at
their
inception
but
their
origin
has
been
forgotten
by
subsequent
generations
and
nothing
has
remained
but
the
bare
wonderful
inexplicable
fact
of
their
performance
thus
they
have
become
in
course
of
time
hallowed
and
the
shaman
who
causes
lightning
to
flash
through
a
dark
room
or
corn
to
grow
and
mature
in
the
course
of
one
day
honestly
believes
in
the
supernatural
origin
of
the
trick
such
men
are
often
very
punctilious
and
while
they
will
go
to
the
direst
extremity
in
what
they
regard
as
their
duties
and
privileges
will
with
equal
scruple
avoid
going
a
single
step
beyond
imbued
with
an
idea
that
they
are
the
of
those
above
they
listen
anxiously
to
everything
that
is
striking
and
strange
and
attribute
to
inspiration
forcible
arguments
as
well
as
their
own
speeches
and
actions
so
it
was
with
the
hishtanyi
chayan
the
refusal
of
hayoue
to
accept
an
honourable
charge
struck
him
as
being
an
expression
of
the
will
of
the
shiuana
against
which
it
was
his
duty
not
to
protest
when
the
young
man
brought
forward
such
strong
arguments
he
was
still
further
confirmed
in
his
belief
and
bowed
to
the
inevitable
in
respectful
silence
at
the
close
of
the
council
the
koshare
retired
to
the
estufa
the
caciques
followed
their
example
and
the
chayan
came
next
but
before
he
withdrew
into
privacy
the
great
had
a
long
talk
with
hayoue
his
object
being
to
strengthen
the
tie
which
united
the
young
man
with
the
people
of
the
rito
and
to
engage
him
not
to
forsake
altogether
the
abode
of
the
spirits
of
his
tribe
hayoue
made
no
definite
promise
beyond
what
he
had
already
pledged
himself
to
at
the
general
meeting
hayoue
and
zashue
had
taken
leave
of
the
invisible
ones
as
well
as
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
tyuonyi
and
ascended
to
the
brink
of
the
southern
mesa
above
the
rito
here
they
turned
around
to
look
back
upon
the
home
to
which
neither
of
them
was
any
longer
strongly
attached
the
sun
was
setting
and
they
wished
to
improve
the
night
for
fear
that
navajos
might
still
be
prowling
about
on
the
mesas
at
the
bottom
of
the
gorge
there
was
little
life
compared
with
the
bustle
that
prevailed
in
former
days
on
the
plateau
the
evening
breeze
fanned
the
trees
in
the
east
distant
lightning
played
about
sombre
clouds
the
is
good
zashue
remarked
to
his
brother
the
zaashtesh
will
not
starve
this
winter
we
have
called
loudly
to
those
above
it
is
well
said
the
other
in
a
tone
of
authority
which
since
his
achievements
he
was
wont
to
assume
toward
his
elder
brother
when
the
koshare
perform
their
duty
they
are
precious
to
the
people
without
the
cuirana
the
elder
replied
the
sprouting
corn
can
not
grow
zashue
had
conceived
a
very
high
opinion
of
hayoue
and
his
weaker
mind
gladly
leaned
upon
the
strong
will
of
the
youth
hayoue
started
it
was
as
if
a
sudden
thought
struck
him
look
see
how
good
the
shiuana
are
we
are
leaving
the
tyuonyi
and
behold
if
we
find
our
people
there
can
be
no
lack
of
food
wherever
we
dwell
i
am
cuirana
you
are
koshare
i
pray
and
fast
for
the
growing
corn
you
do
the
same
for
the
ripening
of
the
grain
it
will
be
well
if
shyuote
is
alive
he
will
help
me
zashue
uttered
these
words
timidly
okoya
will
help
me
hayoue
spoke
with
great
assurance
in
that
case
we
shall
be
four
already
how
often
have
i
told
you
satyumishe
that
okoya
is
good
he
is
a
man
i
saw
it
when
he
struck
nacaytzusle
the
young
moshome
the
elder
brother
said
nothing
he
acknowledged
the
wrong
he
had
done
his
eldest
child
in
case
say
koitza
in
case
shyuote
were
still
alive
it
would
be
owing
to
that
elder
son
of
his
and
his
wife
say
koitza
he
longed
for
now
as
never
before
for
her
sake
he
had
left
everything
his
home
his
field
willingly
he
abandoned
his
whole
past
in
order
to
find
her
he
regretted
all
that
he
had
done
in
that
past
his
suspicions
his
neglect
his
carelessness
to
her
the
fearful
visitations
of
the
latter
days
had
changed
him
completely
all
these
thoughts
he
gathered
in
one
exclamation
if
we
only
find
them
let
us
go
and
search
said
hayoue
turning
to
go
his
brother
followed
him
into
the
woods
henceforth
we
shall
have
to
follow
the
two
adventurers
for
a
while
at
least
therefore
we
also
must
take
leave
of
the
rito
de
los
frijoles
of
its
inhabitants
nothing
striking
can
hereafter
be
told
they
lived
and
died
in
the
seclusion
of
their
valley
gorge
and
neither
the
tehuas
nor
the
navajos
molested
them
in
the
years
following
tyope
continued
to
vegetate
anxiously
taking
care
to
give
no
occasion
for
recalling
his
former
conduct
the
naua
soon
died
the
subsequent
fate
of
the
tribe
is
faintly
delineated
by
dim
historical
traditions
stating
that
they
gradually
emigrated
from
the
rito
in
various
bands
which
little
by
little
in
course
of
time
built
the
villages
inhabited
by
the
queres
indians
of
long
before
the
advent
of
the
spaniards
in
the
sixteenth
century
of
our
era
the
rito
was
deserted
and
forgotten
the
big
house
the
houses
of
the
eagles
and
of
the
corn
clan
are
now
reduced
to
mere
heaps
of
rubbish
overgrown
by
cactus
and
bunches
of
low
grass
most
of
the
have
crumbled
also
but
the
rito
always
remains
a
beautiful
spot
lovely
in
its
solitude
picturesque
and
grand
about
its
ruins
there
hovers
a
charm
which
binds
man
to
the
place
where
untold
centuries
ago
man
lived
loved
suffered
and
died

up
sometimes
drifting
majestically
along
the
horizon
or
crowding
upward
to
spread
dissolve
and
disappear
in
the
zenith
it
is
the
rainy
season
in
new
mexico
with
its
sporadic
showers
its
peculiar
sunlight
moments
of
scorching
heat
and
blasts
of
cool
winds
with
thunder
overhead
to
the
right
and
left
rain
falls
in
streaks
but
without
sultriness
and
with
no
danger
from
violent
or
cyclones
we
are
in
the
beginning
of
the
month
of
september
it
is
warm
but
not
oppressive
and
the
spot
from
which
we
view
the
scenery
around
is
high
open
and
commands
a
wide
extent
of
country
we
stand
on
a
barren
plateau
are
scattered
about
in
confusion
while
tall
arborescent
cacti
rise
between
them
like
skeletons
and
bunches
of
grass
point
upward
here
and
there
north
of
us
the
mesa
expands
in
monotonous
risings
and
swellings
to
the
foot
of
a
tall
exceedingly
graceful
cone
whose
slopes
are
dotted
with
bushes
of
cedar
and
juniper
beyond
it
are
dark
humps
denoting
by
their
shape
that
they
are
extinct
craters
in
the
distance
west
of
that
beautiful
cone
which
is
called
and
very
appropriately
the
tetilla
the
sinuous
profile
of
a
just
peeps
over
the
bleak
line
formed
by
the
mesa
and
its
various
corrugations
nestling
within
its
bosom
rests
the
rito
de
los
frijoles
in
the
south
dense
thunderclouds
overhang
massive
peaks
only
the
base
of
the
sierra
de
sandia
of
the
old
placeres
and
the
numerous
ranges
beyond
is
visible
for
a
heavy
shower
falls
in
that
direction
in
the
east
a
plain
sweeps
into
view
dotted
by
black
specks
looming
up
from
a
reddish
soil
this
plain
rises
gently
to
the
eastward
and
abuts
against
a
tall
whose
summits
also
are
shrouded
in
massive
clouds
we
stand
on
the
bleak
and
wide
mesa
that
interposes
itself
between
the
town
of
santa
fé
and
the
valley
of
the
rio
grande
not
a
living
object
with
the
exception
of
wasps
and
beetles
can
be
seen
everything
appears
dull
and
dead
the
thunder
roars
in
the
distance
and
yet
there
is
life
of
a
higher
order
two
ravens
stalk
about
in
an
earnest
dignified
manner
the
birds
look
exceedingly
and
comically
serious
their
plumage
glistens
in
the
subdued
light
of
the
sun
they
look
out
for
themselves
and
care
nothing
for
the
remainder
of
creation
so
deeply
are
they
imbued
with
a
sentiment
of
their
own
exceptional
position
in
the
realm
of
nature
that
they
pay
no
attention
to
another
phase
of
life
that
shows
itself
near
by
though
not
conspicuously
over
the
surface
of
the
mesa
are
seen
here
and
there
almost
imperceptible
elevations
destitute
of
vegetation
in
these
slight
swellings
apertures
are
visible
out
of
the
latter
the
head
of
a
small
animal
occasionally
protrudes
disappears
again
or
rises
displaying
a
pair
of
front
teeth
then
a
body
pushes
up
from
below
and
a
yellowish
figure
half
squirrel
half
marmot
stands
erect
on
the
hillock
and
utters
a
sharp
squealing
bark
this
barking
is
answered
from
a
neighbouring
protuberance
from
each
hillock
one
of
these
little
animals
crawls
down
and
meeting
one
another
they
stand
up
facing
each
other
scratch
and
bite
for
a
moment
then
separate
and
return
to
their
respective
other
similar
creatures
wriggle
about
in
the
vicinity
the
shrill
barking
sounds
far
and
near
a
colony
of
prairie
dogs
dwells
in
the
neighbourhood
to
this
exhibition
of
animal
life
the
ravens
pay
no
attention
whatever
it
is
beneath
their
notice
their
aims
are
of
a
higher
order
than
those
of
beings
who
live
upon
roots
and
who
burrow
for
their
abode
they
live
on
prey
that
is
far
above
the
simple
products
of
animal
industry
carrion
is
what
they
aspire
to
therefore
they
aspire
with
a
lofty
mien
prying
and
peering
in
every
direction
for
something
fallen
they
are
not
far
from
the
eastern
brink
of
the
mesa
where
the
volcanic
flow
breaks
off
suddenly
in
short
abrupt
palisades
who
knows
what
their
keen
eyes
may
have
espied
along
that
brink
another
actor
appears
upon
the
scene
a
prairie
wolf
or
coyote
consequently
a
rival
a
competitor
of
the
ravens
for
he
is
in
the
same
business
but
he
belongs
to
a
higher
order
for
while
the
ravens
are
scavengers
the
coyote
is
a
hunter
as
well
he
would
even
prey
upon
the
birds
themselves
as
he
approaches
with
tail
drooping
and
ears
erect
and
stops
to
sniff
the
air
and
glance
about
slyly
the
ravens
hop
off
sidewise
away
from
the
dangerous
neighbour
still
they
are
loath
to
go
for
the
wolf
may
discover
something
the
leavings
of
which
they
may
perhaps
enjoy
but
the
coyote
lies
down
with
his
head
between
his
forepaws
and
in
this
attitude
pushes
his
body
forward
almost
imperceptibly
such
motions
are
very
suspicious
the
scavengers
flap
their
wings
rise
into
the
air
and
soar
away
to
some
more
secure
spot
the
coyote
however
seems
in
no
wise
disappointed
at
the
departure
of
the
ravens
he
pays
no
attention
to
their
flight
but
moves
on
toward
the
that
indicate
the
rim
of
the
plateau
there
he
has
noticed
something
an
object
that
lies
motionless
like
a
corpse
it
may
be
a
corpse
and
therefore
something
to
prey
upon
nearer
the
coyote
glides
the
object
is
long
or
elongated
its
colour
is
lighter
than
that
of
the
surrounding
it
but
its
farther
end
is
dark
now
that
end
moves
and
the
head
of
an
indian
a
village
indian
of
new
mexico
looms
up
above
the
boulders
the
coyote
has
seen
enough
for
the
man
is
alive
and
not
carrion
away
the
beast
trots
with
drooping
tail
and
ears
the
indian
who
has
been
lying
there
with
his
face
turned
to
the
east
rises
to
his
knees
and
faces
about
his
features
are
those
of
a
man
on
the
threshold
of
mature
age
we
know
this
man
we
have
seen
him
before
and
yet
it
can
not
be
for
how
thin
how
wan
how
hollow
the
cheeks
how
sunken
the
eyes
the
face
notwithstanding
the
red
paint
appears
sallow
still
it
is
an
old
acquaintance
although
since
we
saw
him
last
he
has
sadly
changed
now
he
turns
his
face
to
the
south
and
we
catch
a
glimpse
of
his
profile
it
is
zashue
tihua
the
indian
from
the
rito
de
los
frijoles
husband
of
say
koitza
and
father
to
okoya
and
shyuote
what
is
he
doing
here
it
is
now
more
than
three
weeks
since
he
and
his
brother
hayoue
took
leave
of
the
tyuonyi
in
order
to
search
for
their
lost
people
they
went
forth
into
that
limited
yet
for
the
indian
immensely
vast
world
called
central
new
mexico
in
a
month
a
travelling
indian
may
easily
be
hundreds
of
miles
away
if
unimpeded
in
his
march
but
we
find
him
here
barely
a
day
journey
from
the
rito
a
strong
man
can
not
have
spent
all
this
time
in
going
such
a
little
distance
he
must
have
wandered
far
strayed
back
and
forth
up
and
down
perhaps
into
the
western
mountains
where
the
navajos
lurk
the
bad
men
who
frightened
his
wife
and
children
away
from
their
homes
or
who
perhaps
captured
or
killed
them
or
he
may
have
gone
to
the
south
where
the
black
cloud
is
hanging
and
where
it
thunders
and
the
hang
like
long
black
veils
of
mourning
he
has
perchance
tramped
down
the
rio
grande
valley
through
sand
by
groves
of
and
where
the
howl
and
wail
now
he
comes
back
unrequited
for
all
his
labour
and
sufferings
for
those
whom
he
sought
are
not
with
him
his
gaze
was
not
directed
to
the
north
when
the
wolf
espied
him
but
to
the
east
he
may
be
on
the
homeward
stretch
but
he
has
not
given
up
all
hope
his
eyes
look
for
those
whom
he
has
lost
he
is
loath
to
give
up
the
search
loath
to
return
alone
to
the
home
which
the
enemy
has
soiled
with
the
lifeblood
of
his
youngest
child
he
is
changed
in
appearance
lean
and
with
hollow
burning
eyes
he
gazes
at
the
clouds
as
if
there
he
might
find
his
missing
wife
and
children
as
he
kneels
and
gazes
another
indian
rises
from
amidst
the
shaggy
blocks
of
lava
a
short
distance
off
stands
up
and
then
sits
down
upon
a
rock
he
turns
his
head
to
the
east
he
too
is
gaunt
and
thin
his
features
are
pale
and
his
eyes
lie
deep
in
their
sockets
on
his
back
hangs
a
shield
but
it
is
soiled
beaten
and
perforated
to
his
arm
is
fastened
a
and
the
quiver
on
his
back
is
with
newly
made
arrows
as
this
indian
turns
his
face
to
the
north
we
recognize
him
also
it
is
hayoue
hayoue
as
emaciated
and
careworn
as
his
brother
zashue
they
are
alone
neither
has
found
anything
yet
zashue
rises
to
go
where
his
brother
is
sitting
as
the
latter
perceives
him
he
points
with
his
arm
to
the
east
there
at
the
farthest
end
of
the
plain
at
the
foot
of
the
high
mountains
a
long
row
of
recedes
in
an
angle
to
this
angle
hayoue
is
pointing
an
untrained
eye
would
have
seen
nothing
but
hills
and
the
lower
end
of
slopes
dark
and
frowning
above
which
seething
clouds
occasionally
disclose
higher
folds
of
mountains
whose
tops
are
shrouded
in
mist
but
zashue
has
no
untrained
eye
he
gazes
and
gazes
at
last
he
turns
around
to
his
brother
with
an
approving
nod
and
says
fire
puyatye
zaashtesh
hayoue
replies
and
each
looks
at
the
other
inquiringly
where
we
might
have
seen
but
the
usual
dim
haze
veiling
distant
objects
they
have
discovered
a
bluish
tint
capping
the
hills
like
a
pale
streak
it
denotes
the
presence
of
smoke
therefore
fire
not
a
burning
forest
for
there
is
no
high
timber
on
that
range
of
but
smoke
arising
from
a
place
where
people
are
dwelling
the
roaming
mountain
indians
the
apaches
or
navajos
settle
nowhere
permanently
the
smoke
has
not
been
produced
by
their
straggling
it
indicates
the
location
of
a
permanent
village
those
village
indians
that
dwell
east
of
the
rio
grande
are
tanos
and
the
queres
call
them
puyatye
there
must
be
a
tano
village
in
that
corner
far
away
where
the
bluish
film
hovers
hayoue
is
right
a
puyatye
zaashtesh
stands
where
lies
the
capital
of
new
mexico
the
old
spanish
settlement
of
santa
fé
the
brothers
cast
their
eyes
to
the
ground
both
seem
to
be
in
doubt
zashue
is
the
first
to
speak
do
you
suppose
that
our
people
might
be
at
that
zaashtesh
hayoue
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
may
be
i
do
know
will
it
be
safe
for
us
to
go
to
the
puyatye
the
other
inquired
doubtfully
the
younger
sighs
and
answers
they
have
never
done
wrong
to
us
still
they
speak
the
tongue
of
the
people
of
karo
it
is
true
but
they
live
nearer
to
us
but
they
are
tehuas
too
like
the
people
of
the
north
and
hayoue
interrupts
him
saying
our
folk
have
gone
to
them
as
often
as
they
wished
and
the
puyatye
have
received
them
well
giving
them
what
was
right
why
should
they
now
be
hard
toward
us
still
if
the
tehuas
have
gone
to
see
them
saying
queres
from
the
tyuonyi
came
to
strike
us
like
moshome
over
night
look
and
see
that
they
do
not
hurt
you
also
and
now
we
come
with
shield
bow
and
arrow
what
can
the
puyatye
think
other
than
that
we
are
moshome
queres
hayoue
feels
the
weight
of
this
observation
he
casts
his
eye
to
the
ground
and
remains
silent
zashue
continues
it
is
true
that
the
moshome
dinne
can
not
have
killed
all
our
people
this
we
found
out
on
the
r
tye
pointing
to
the
sierra
de
san
miguel
ere
i
killed
the
old
man
to
take
ahtzeta
from
him
he
lifted
all
of
his
fingers
four
times
and
pointed
over
here
do
you
not
think
satyumishe
that
he
meant
to
tell
me
thereby
that
forty
of
our
people
escaped
and
fled
to
hanyi
i
do
and
that
is
the
reason
why
i
believe
we
shall
find
them
in
hashyuko
the
eastern
corner
the
queres
name
for
the
place
where
santa
fé
stands
replied
the
other
very
positively
behold
satyumishe
we
have
searched
everywhere
we
could
have
followed
every
trail
we
could
follow
nearly
all
the
tracks
were
those
of
our
people
of
that
i
am
sure
and
how
far
have
we
not
gone
after
them
ten
days
at
least
we
were
in
the
mountains
on
the
tracks
of
the
moshome
dinne
we
fought
them
and
took
ahtzeta
at
last
we
learned
that
many
of
our
women
and
children
had
been
taken
by
those
shuatyam
and
that
we
never
any
more
could
obtain
them
also
that
okoya
was
probably
not
still
alive
then
we
went
south
and
saw
tracks
small
tracks
of
children
larger
ones
of
women
and
a
few
that
were
those
of
men
we
went
toward
cuame
until
we
could
not
see
the
tracks
because
it
had
rained
and
the
rain
had
washed
them
away
to
go
farther
was
useless
for
whither
should
we
go
there
are
other
zaashtesh
farther
down
the
rio
grande
so
the
naua
told
me
replied
zashue
but
these
dwell
far
far
away
he
waved
his
hand
to
the
south
where
it
is
very
warm
and
where
there
are
a
great
many
moshome
those
are
too
far
off
hayoue
said
shaking
his
head
our
people
did
not
go
so
far
without
resting
we
must
have
overtaken
them
for
we
rested
not
the
elder
brother
nodded
he
was
fully
conscious
that
they
had
never
rested
on
the
journey
he
felt
it
now
therefore
brother
hayoue
went
on
i
believe
that
those
whom
we
look
for
are
there
pointing
to
the
east
in
the
sierra
del
valle
are
only
those
whom
the
moshome
have
captured
the
others
must
have
turned
back
along
the
river
crossing
it
to
go
to
the
puyatye
for
there
are
no
moshome
over
here
and
if
the
puyatye
speak
like
the
tehuas
their
hearts
are
different
and
more
like
ours
i
think
we
should
go
to
the
zaashtesh
yonder
at
the
foot
of
the
big
kote
where
the
snow
is
hanging
if
we
do
not
find
them
there
then
i
think
we
should
go
farther
as
far
as
where
the
buffaloes
are
feeding
there
are
villages
there
too
i
have
been
told
and
there
our
people
will
be
if
we
once
know
which
of
them
are
alive
and
free
we
shall
also
know
those
who
are
among
the
moshome
and
can
see
what
to
do
for
them
it
strikes
me
zashue
still
objected
that
if
the
koitza
and
the
little
ones
were
on
this
side
of
the
river
we
must
have
seen
their
tracks
but
it
rains
brother
hayoue
replied
looking
up
at
the
sky
the
shiuana
send
us
rain
every
night
and
often
during
the
day
and
it
washes
away
the
footprints
besides
we
have
merely
followed
the
river
thus
far
and
our
people
may
have
turned
inland
there
is
so
much
sand
on
the
banks
that
the
rain
destroys
all
zashue
looked
up
a
thought
had
struck
him
like
a
flash
have
you
seen
the
ravine
below
here
he
pointed
to
the
south
how
would
it
do
for
us
to
look
there
the
ravine
comes
from
the
river
you
are
right
hayoue
assented
rising
and
moving
slowly
on
the
strong
young
man
was
tired
almost
exhausted
from
endless
roaming
searching
spying
and
from
hunger
and
thirst
combined
zashue
took
a
more
southeasterly
direction
so
that
both
struck
the
brink
of
the
ravine
at
some
distance
apart
from
the
brink
they
looked
down
into
a
deep
cleft
at
the
bottom
of
which
the
little
rio
de
santa
fé
winds
its
course
toward
the
rio
grande
this
cleft
is
the
gorge
which
is
called
cañon
de
las
bocas
south
of
it
the
plateaus
continue
with
barren
undulations
and
whitish
hills
they
rise
gradually
to
the
base
of
a
sombre
mountain
cluster
the
bulk
of
which
was
wrapped
in
clouds
as
well
as
the
huge
mass
of
the
sandia
chain
to
its
right
still
farther
to
the
right
the
rio
grande
valley
opened
chased
along
that
valley
to
meet
a
shower
which
was
sending
into
it
a
cloud
had
meanwhile
gathered
over
the
heads
of
the
wanderers
thunder
reverberated
and
the
raindrops
began
to
fall
the
men
paid
no
attention
they
gazed
down
at
the
little
torrent
beneath
at
the
groups
of
on
its
banks
and
at
the
scattered
patches
of
open
ground
along
its
course
their
desire
was
to
descend
into
the
gorge
to
search
for
traces
of
those
whom
they
longed
for
the
descent
was
impracticable
from
where
they
had
stopped
a
rim
of
vertical
cliffs
of
lava
and
trap
formed
the
upper
border
of
the
cleft
suddenly
hayoue
exclaimed
umo
they
are
not
down
here
or
we
should
see
them
from
above
let
us
go
farther
where
there
are
no
rocks
and
where
the
stream
enters
the
gorge
if
our
people
have
come
through
here
we
must
find
their
tracks
at
the
outlet
it
is
well
replied
zashue
the
shower
drizzled
out
its
main
force
was
spent
on
the
southern
plateaus
and
cool
gusts
of
wind
blew
across
to
the
north
side
when
the
brothers
had
clambered
down
the
rugged
slope
covered
with
scattered
to
the
sandy
nook
where
now
stands
the
hamlet
of
the
clouds
had
again
lifted
over
hashyuko
and
on
the
slope
of
the
high
sierra
the
bluish
cloudlet
swam
clear
and
distinct
much
water
ran
in
the
bed
of
the
river
at
the
mouth
of
the
bocas
and
there
was
no
hope
of
finding
any
tracks
there
the
men
staggered
up
and
down
and
at
last
zashue
stood
still
bent
over
and
appeared
to
examine
something
then
he
called
aloud
come
over
here
with
this
he
raised
something
from
the
ground
hayoue
went
over
to
him
and
both
looked
at
the
object
carefully
it
was
a
piece
of
cloth
made
of
cotton
dyed
black
of
the
size
of
a
hand
torn
off
but
recently
and
soiled
by
mud
and
moisture
hayoue
nodded
the
find
pleased
him
that
is
from
our
women
said
he
the
women
from
the
puyatye
zashue
said
doubtingly
wear
skirts
like
our
koitza
it
is
so
but
the
women
from
hashyuko
do
not
go
so
far
from
their
homes
now
nothing
is
ripe
neither
cactus
figs
nor
yucca
fruit
what
should
they
come
out
here
for
when
do
our
women
ever
go
so
far
from
the
zaashtesh
shotaye
used
to
go
farther
objected
the
elder
shotaye
hayoue
muttered
shotaye
was
you
know
what
she
was
there
is
none
like
her
in
the
world
what
she
may
be
doing
in
case
she
is
alive
nobody
can
tell
i
wish
i
knew
her
to
be
with
say
koitza
now
zashue
sighed
shotaye
is
dead
his
brother
asserted
but
i
believe
that
this
rag
is
from
our
people
and
you
were
right
in
coming
hither
look
pointing
to
the
entrance
of
the
bocas
they
came
through
there
and
from
the
west
even
if
we
find
no
trace
of
them
i
still
believe
that
they
went
to
hashyuko
and
that
we
shall
find
them
there
let
us
go
ere
it
is
too
late
the
last
words
were
uttered
in
such
a
positive
tone
that
zashue
yielded
and
followed
his
brother
who
since
their
discovery
again
moved
with
vigorous
strides
since
the
last
evening
neither
of
them
had
eaten
anything
and
their
meal
then
had
been
scanty
enough
the
discovery
had
infused
new
strength
into
their
exhausted
bodies
and
the
brothers
walked
on
side
by
side
as
if
they
were
well
fed
and
thoroughly
rested
zashue
still
remained
in
doubt
he
would
rather
have
made
further
researches
he
knew
from
the
talk
of
old
men
that
the
tanos
inhabited
villages
farther
south
and
it
was
possible
that
the
fugitives
afraid
of
the
dispositions
of
the
puyatye
that
lived
closer
to
the
tehuas
had
avoided
them
in
order
to
take
refuge
at
a
greater
distance
from
the
people
of
the
puye
but
above
all
zashue
felt
strong
misgivings
in
regard
to
the
reception
which
he
and
his
brother
both
armed
as
they
were
might
find
at
hashyuko
under
different
circumstances
he
would
have
gone
to
the
tanos
without
any
fear
and
would
have
entered
the
village
as
a
guest
now
since
the
queres
of
the
rito
and
the
tehuas
had
come
to
blows
it
was
possible
that
the
latter
had
informed
their
relatives
in
the
southeast
of
what
occurred
and
thus
made
them
suspicious
of
the
queres
he
and
his
brother
carried
the
implements
of
war
but
they
were
not
in
that
looked
very
suspicious
and
they
might
be
taken
for
spies
and
as
soon
as
they
should
be
noticed
some
of
the
tanos
might
lie
in
wait
for
them
with
evil
intentions
if
on
the
other
hand
hayoue
was
right
then
all
would
be
right
but
he
could
not
agree
with
his
brother
on
that
point
a
certain
instinct
told
him
that
the
fugitives
had
wandered
south
instead
of
east
nevertheless
he
yielded
willingly
to
the
superior
energy
and
determination
of
hayoue
zashue
was
a
weak
man
and
glad
to
lean
upon
a
stronger
arm
a
more
determined
will
hayoue
on
his
part
was
fully
convinced
of
the
correctness
of
his
views
he
had
no
thought
of
danger
he
reflected
and
zashue
had
overlooked
this
important
point
that
in
case
the
tehuas
notified
the
tanos
of
recent
occurrences
they
would
not
fail
to
boast
of
their
signal
triumph
and
to
represent
the
defeat
of
the
queres
as
akin
to
complete
destruction
therefore
in
what
light
could
he
and
his
brother
appear
to
the
people
of
hashyuko
than
as
fugitives
from
a
tribe
well
nigh
exterminated
fugitives
of
that
class
are
always
even
by
savages
received
and
treated
as
guests
finally
should
it
come
to
blows
hayoue
was
ready
for
them
also
to
give
as
well
as
take
the
distance
which
separated
the
two
men
from
their
place
of
destination
was
about
twelve
english
miles
the
plain
between
the
upper
or
eastern
mouth
of
the
cañon
of
the
bocas
and
the
foot
of
the
santa
fé
rises
gradually
and
in
even
but
extensive
undulations
it
is
closed
to
the
north
by
a
broad
sandy
ridge
which
skirts
the
northern
bank
of
the
little
santa
fé
stream
that
ridge
extends
from
the
east
where
santa
fé
stands
to
the
volcanic
mesa
through
which
the
cleft
of
the
bocas
meanders
in
the
west
and
the
plain
lies
south
of
it
dipping
in
that
direction
as
well
as
to
the
west
also
several
ravines
with
sloping
borders
run
through
it
from
east
to
west
the
nearest
one
south
of
the
santa
fé
river
is
called
arroyo
hondo
these
gorges
or
channels
are
dry
except
in
the
rainy
season
when
torrents
of
water
gush
down
them
for
a
few
hours
after
some
exceedingly
violent
shower
in
the
mountains
the
vegetation
of
the
plain
consists
mainly
of
juniper
and
tall
arborescent
cacti
hayoue
took
the
direction
to
the
northeast
keeping
between
the
santa
fé
creek
on
their
left
and
the
arroyo
hondo
on
the
right
as
often
happens
during
the
afternoon
the
sky
had
begun
to
clear
and
as
evening
approached
the
tall
santa
fé
sierra
shone
out
majestically
free
from
clouds
the
top
of
baldy
covered
with
snow
the
high
timber
on
the
lower
ridges
appeared
distinct
and
the
folds
of
the
clothed
in
vivid
green
alternated
with
black
yet
luminous
shadows
a
cool
wind
blew
from
the
south
in
gusts
and
the
wanderers
hastened
their
steps
lest
night
should
overtake
them
ere
they
could
reach
the
village
now
distinguishable
below
the
blue
cloud
of
smoke
as
a
reddish
protuberance
on
a
bleak
hill
zashue
stood
still
and
beckoned
his
brother
to
do
the
same
and
listen
from
the
direction
they
were
going
came
faint
cries
the
brothers
looked
at
each
other
there
are
puyatye
over
there
said
hayoue
ko
assented
zashue
then
as
if
making
a
discovery
he
added
they
are
hunting
rabbits
and
hares
you
are
right
surely
they
hunt
rabbits
said
hayoue
his
eyes
brightening
at
the
suggestion
what
shall
we
do
zashue
asked
we
will
go
to
them
at
once
said
the
other
that
is
very
good
very
good
for
us
indeed
for
if
they
hunt
rabbits
all
their
yaya
and
nashtio
will
be
there
too
one
of
the
broad
swellings
which
traverse
the
santa
fé
plain
lay
between
the
young
men
and
the
place
whence
the
sounds
came
it
concealed
the
hunters
from
their
gaze
but
the
manner
in
which
the
cries
seemed
to
shift
proved
that
they
were
swiftly
moving
to
and
fro
zashue
felt
greatly
relieved
for
his
explanation
that
the
tanos
might
be
on
a
general
hunt
for
rabbits
was
probably
true
and
it
was
a
very
good
sign
the
is
usually
a
prelude
to
solemn
dances
therefore
it
was
not
likely
that
the
tanos
suspected
danger
or
had
any
knowledge
of
events
at
the
puye
the
great
still
practised
by
all
the
pueblos
several
times
during
each
year
is
a
communal
undertaking
a
religious
ceremony
in
which
not
only
the
men
take
part
but
the
women
and
children
also
the
object
is
to
obtain
the
skins
which
the
chief
penitents
use
for
some
sacramental
purpose
it
is
also
a
feast
and
a
day
of
rejoicing
and
merriment
for
the
whole
village
the
hunt
is
under
the
direction
of
the
principal
war
captain
and
the
leading
dignitaries
share
the
sport
long
prayers
around
a
fire
which
is
started
outside
of
the
pueblo
opens
the
performance
the
game
is
hunted
and
killed
with
clubs
and
a
lively
and
sometimes
amusing
rivalry
is
displayed
by
both
sexes
in
securing
the
rabbits
which
often
gives
rise
to
very
ludicrous
scenes
sometimes
the
hunt
is
continued
for
several
days
in
succession
when
the
brothers
reached
the
crest
of
the
undulation
they
witnessed
sights
that
to
a
stranger
would
have
been
nearly
incomprehensible
men
women
and
children
were
running
back
and
forth
in
every
direction
no
longer
chasing
game
but
playing
laughing
romping
with
loud
and
boisterous
talk
small
groups
were
already
going
home
loaded
with
game
others
with
empty
hands
to
the
great
amusement
and
merciless
jeering
of
the
successful
hunters
among
the
former
were
men
dressed
in
the
costume
of
women
while
with
the
lucky
ones
women
in
male
attire
paraded
proudly
it
was
an
animated
picture
spread
over
a
wide
expanse
but
it
was
moving
back
to
the
village
in
the
east
and
when
the
indians
from
the
rito
stood
still
to
observe
there
remained
in
their
immediate
vicinity
only
a
few
men
in
female
garb
beyond
them
stood
a
group
of
five
or
six
persons
laughing
and
jesting
over
the
broad
plain
there
rested
a
mild
subdued
glow
of
pleasant
twilight
the
highest
summits
of
the
sierra
glistened
in
fiery
hues
hayoue
stepped
up
boldly
his
brother
keeping
alongside
watchfully
he
was
ready
not
to
flee
but
to
hide
and
use
the
bow
in
case
of
necessity
they
were
noticed
by
those
standing
nearest
the
men
in
women
garb
were
busy
breaking
twigs
and
branches
or
cutting
them
off
with
stone
implements
at
the
sight
of
strangers
they
suspended
work
and
stared
hayoue
laid
aside
his
bow
and
quiver
and
extended
his
right
hand
calling
out
queres
tyuonyi
no
answer
came
zashue
could
not
control
his
mirth
at
the
sight
of
the
men
in
such
guise
he
broke
out
in
a
ringing
laugh
pointed
at
them
and
shouted
puyatye
then
to
himself
with
the
exclamation
koshare
the
salutations
called
forth
no
reply
the
tanos
continued
to
stare
it
was
not
merely
astonishment
which
caused
them
to
remain
motionless
there
was
quite
as
much
embarrassment
on
their
part
for
these
men
in
women
wraps
had
had
to
assume
the
costumes
as
a
punishment
because
they
had
allowed
women
to
outwit
or
them
in
the
joint
pursuit
of
the
same
animal
whenever
a
man
and
a
woman
during
one
of
these
ceremonial
hunts
chase
the
same
rabbit
and
the
woman
succeeds
in
slaying
it
then
her
male
competitor
must
exchange
his
dress
for
that
of
the
successful
woman
who
in
turn
proudly
amidst
applause
and
jeerings
assumes
the
garb
of
the
male
the
man
thereafter
has
to
go
on
hunting
until
he
kills
a
rabbit
himself
and
can
by
offering
it
to
the
woman
reclaim
his
clothing
all
are
not
lucky
enough
to
succeed
and
it
happens
sometimes
that
the
hunt
is
over
before
their
efforts
are
successful
such
unfortunates
are
required
to
gather
a
load
of
firewood
as
big
as
they
can
carry
and
bring
it
to
the
house
of
the
woman
holding
their
clothes
in
pledge
thereupon
the
dresses
are
exchanged
and
the
night
passes
in
the
usual
childish
amusements
for
the
many
in
religious
rites
for
the
religious
functionaries
the
men
first
seen
by
the
brothers
betrayed
by
their
dress
and
occupation
that
they
belonged
to
the
unlucky
ones
they
saw
at
a
glance
that
the
were
village
indians
they
also
recognized
from
their
behaviour
that
they
came
with
friendly
intentions
this
increased
their
embarrassment
for
they
knew
or
at
least
supposed
that
the
strangers
would
see
at
once
the
cause
of
their
strange
appearance
so
great
was
their
uneasiness
that
one
of
them
crouched
behind
a
bush
to
hide
meanwhile
all
the
tehuas
who
had
been
standing
some
distance
off
came
running
up
with
the
exception
of
one
who
was
seen
going
toward
the
pueblo
at
full
speed
the
others
held
their
wooden
clubs
ready
in
case
of
trouble
hayoue
advanced
toward
them
in
his
usual
unconcerned
way
and
saluted
them
with
guatzena
puyatye
zashue
had
remained
behind
keeping
an
eye
on
the
weapons
which
both
of
them
had
laid
on
the
ground
the
tanos
whispered
and
whispered
they
evidently
guessed
at
the
meaning
of
hayoue
words
for
one
of
them
stepped
up
and
replied
with
the
usual
compliment
in
tehua

each
grasped
the
other
hand
hayoue
uttered
queres
and
pointing
to
the
west
tyuonyi
to
this
speech
the
other
replied
by
pointing
at
himself
and
at
his
comrades
with
the
word
tano
then
at
the
village
which
was
still
dimly
visible
in

twilight

thereupon
he
made
the
for
sleep
and
breathed
on
hayoue
hand
the
latter
responded
to
the
compliment
and
gave
zashue
a
signal
to
come
nearer
when
zashue
rejoined
the
group
they
all
greeted
the
queres
in
the
same
manner
and
the
one
who
was
still
holding
hayoue
hand
began
to
pull
him
along
urging
him
to
go
to
the
village
with
them
the
adventurers
from
the
rito
felt
that
they
might
be
welcome
zashue
even
made
an
eccentric
clownish
jump
exclaiming
koshare

boisterous
laughter
broke
out
one
of
the
tanos
threw
his

around

his
voice

whispering

no

was
possible
the

was
a
brother
a
koshare
like
zashue
and
delighted
to
meet
another
from
the
west
more
and
more
lively
the
men
became
on
both
sides
clumsy
attempts
at
explanation
were
made
words
signs
gestures
passed
between
them
while
walking
briskly
on
and
all
were
merry
and
in
good
spirits
it
was
night
behind
the
gigantic
wall
of
mountains
in
the
east
a
whitish
glare
arose
the
light
of
the
rising
moon
the
group
had
reached
the
banks
of
the
rio
de
santa
fé
near
where
now
stands
the
church
of
nuestra
señora
de

before
them
lay
a
dusky
wilderness
abutting
against
steep
hills
on
the
highest
of
those
which
overlooks
the
present
town
in
the
north
a
terraced
mound
could
be
distinguished
and
from
its
sides
luminous
points
twinkled
in
ruddy
light
the
thumping
of
drums
shrill
flutes
and
an
undefined
noise
rhythmic
in
its
character
in
which
human
voices
and
numerous
rattles
were
confusedly
mingled
issued
from
a
quarter
above
which
a
glow
arose
like
that
of
a
fire
burning
within
that
irregular
pile
was
the
pueblo
of
oga
p
hoge
it
stood
where
fort
marcy
was
subsequently
erected
by
the
united
states
troops
the
moon
had
risen
and
rested
on
the
higher
crests
of
the
mountains
its
light
penetrated
the
basin
in
which
now
the
town
of
santa
fé
extends
on
both
banks
of
the
little
stream
and
south
of
it
when
the
moon
thus
stands
over
the
heights
and
looks
down
the
turrets
and
cupolas
of
the
capitol
hospitals
and
seminaries
glisten
in
phosphorescent
light
and
the
towers
of
the
cathedral
loom
up
solemnly
casting
on
the
ground
before
it
shadows
over
elegant
dwellings
over
modest
flat
roofs
of
adobe
houses
over
military
buildings
institutes
for
the
education
of
those
of
all
races
and
creeds
the
moonlight
rests
peacefully
brilliant
music
sounds
in
the
plaza
from
the
heights
in
the
northwest
a
spark
rushes
down
in
serpentine
windings
nearer
and
nearer
the
approaching
railway
train
from
the
south
a
shrill
whistle
is
heard
another
iron
horse
sweeping
up
with
people
and
news
from
the
outside
world
rustle
in
the
evening
breeze
and
their
leaves
dance
alternately
plunged
in
silvery
brightness
and
transparent
night
the
heights
of
fort
marcy
are
deserted
bleak
by
daylight
pale
and
yet
frowning
when
shines
the
moon
since
the
seventeenth
century
life
has
sprung
up
at
its
base
at
the
time
when
hayoue
and
zashue
lived
life
was
above
and
looked
down
upon
a
wilderness
beneath
the
hills
are
wild
formerly
cedar
and
cactus
alone
peopled
the
banks
of
the
river
growing
along
the
rills
and
on
the
formed
by
the
torrent
the
group
of
men
with
hayoue
and
zashue
in
their
midst
halted
on
the
south
bank
this
did
not
suit
zashue
it
struck
him
as
rather
unfriendly
or
at
least
as
suspicious
their
companions
were
evidently
waiting
for
orders
ere
they
crossed
the
river
a
man
came
splashing
through
the
water
and
called
out
something
which
the
queres
of
course
did
not
understand
at
once
all
conversation
ceased
and
the
tanos
became
silent
and
grave
the
spoke
first
he
spoke
rapidly
and
in
a
low
voice
then
grasped
hayoue
hand
to
breathe
on
it
and
held
it
fast
zashue
hands
as
well
had
been
seized
by
two
tanos
his
bow
and
quiver
had
been
removed
from
him
under
some
friendly
pretext
they
were
disarmed
then
all
moved
on
forded
the
stream
and
took
a
trail
that
led
directly
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
where
stood
the
pueblo
all
sounds
of
merriment
above
were
hushed
nothing
moved
but
the
men
and
the
night
wind
rustling
through
the
shrubbery
at
the
foot
of
the
high
hill
other
indians
came
up
these
were
armed
and
they
followed
the
group
all
this
looked
ominous
they
were
no
longer
treated
as
guests
they
were
prisoners
zashue
was
not
so
much
surprised
as
hayoue
for
he
had
always
mistrusted
hayoue
inwardly
raved
he
reproached
himself
for
not
having
listened
to
his
brother
warnings
for
having
allowed
his
rashness
his
conceit
his
to
prevail
to
such
an
extent
as
to
fall
into
a
trap
which
he
felt
sure
the
tanos
had
artfully
laid
and
cunningly
sprung
upon
them
still
all
his
indignation
and
rage
were
of
no
avail
even
if
he
were
able
to
free
himself
from
the
grasp
of
his
guards
and
to
escape
the
that
would
be
aimed
at
the
fugitive
he
saw
no
chance
for
him
in
the
relentless
chase
that
would
follow
all
advantages
would
be
on
the
side
of
the
tanos
who
knew
the
country
whereas
he
was
a
total
stranger
nothing
was
left
him
but
to
resign
himself
to
his
fate
and
to
await
the
course
of
events
it
was
hard
for
the
proud
young
warrior
it
was
not
only
hard
but
if
he
took
into
consideration
his
overbearing
manner
toward
zashue
a
punishment
justly
merited
hayoue
hung
his
head
crestfallen
and
in
bitter
wrath
at
last
some
one
came
down
the
steep
hill
muttered
a
few
words
and
the
ascent
began
nobody
turned
back
to
glance
at
the
moonlit
expanse
that
was
unfolding
itself
more
and
more
beneath
a
dismal
yelping
sounded
from
below
the
voice
of
a
coyote
from
the
banks
of
the
stream
the
wolf
had
followed
the
returning
hunters
he
licked
the
blood
trickling
from
the
dead
game
and
called
his
comrades
other
voices
answered
in
the
neighbourhood
from
various
parts
of
the
basin
the
barking
died
away
in
a
mournful
dismal
wail
mingled
with
shrieks
sobs
and
fiendish
laughter
it
rose
from
the
depths
filling
the
air
from
the
hills
and
changing
its
modulations
a
horrible
chorus
of
moans
and
groans
alternating
with
exclamations
of
hellish
triumph
a
shiver
passed
through
both
the
prisoners
their
entrance
into
oga
p
hoge
took
place
with
dismal
prognostications
the
pueblo
was
built
in
the
shape
of
a
rectangle
the
north
and
east
sides
of
it
formed
a
continuous
structure
narrow
alleys
separated
them
from
the
south
and
the
west
sides
and
between
the
two
there
was
also
an
alley
of
entrance
and
exit
through
the
latter
therefore
on
the
southwest
corner
the
tanos
entered
an
open
space
like
a
large
surrounded
by
the
terraced
buildings
composing
the
village
at
the
approach
of
the
group
human
forms
had
appeared
on
the
flat
roofs
and
peered
down
upon
the
prisoners
with
curious
eyes
as
soon
as
the
captives
entered
the
square
the
number
of
spectators
increased
they
came
out
from
the
interior
from
lower
stories
down
from
the
upper
tier
men
women
and
children
they
descended
into
the
square
and
the
whole
population
of
the
village
about
four
hundred
souls
gathered
around
the
strangers
and
their
guard
all
the
men
were
not
among
them
a
dozen
videttes
were
distributed
on
the
flat
roofs
and
nearly
fifty
warriors
hastily
armed
and
equipped
had
scattered
at
some
distance
from
the
buildings
along
the
hills
throughout
the
basin
to
intercept
a
possible
flight
as
well
as
to
guard
approaches
in
case
the
two
prisoners
should
be
merely
advance
scouts
of
a
larger
body
of
enemies
of
all
this
hayoue
and
zashue
knew
nothing
of
course
but
they
noticed
that
the
throng
about
them
was
not
friendly
that
an
ominous
silence
prevailed
hardly
a
whisper
was
heard
a
few
women
only
gesticulated
wildly
the
tanos
dropped
the
hands
of
their
captives
but
they
remained
around
them
still
for
a
long
while
they
were
left
to
stand
nobody
brought
them
food
nobody
offered
them
water
to
allay
their
thirst
the
whispering
grew
louder
it
sounded
like
murmured
threats
at
last
the
hands
of
the
strangers
were
again
seized
and
they
were
led
across
the
square
to
the
northeastern
corner
the
throng
opened
in
front
of
them
as
they
advanced
closing
in
behind
and
all
following
like
children
after
a
procession
some
ran
along
the
walls
eager
to
be
near
and
on
hand
when
the
strangers
came
up
their
curiosity
was
soon
gratified
for
the
square
was
small
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
notched
beams
another
halt
was
made
two
of
the
guards
climbed
up
and
exchanged
a
few
words
with
an
indian
sitting
on
the
roof
then
hayoue
was
signalled
to
follow
a
tano
came
behind
him
after
him
zashue
and
then
two
armed
men
the
crowd
had
meanwhile
closed
up
against
the
wall
pressing
eye
and
ear
against
the
out
of
which
the
firelight
shone
nobody
attempted
to
climb
the
roof
but
all
remained
below
a
moving
wrangling
crowd
of
people
illuminated
by
the
placid
light
of
the
moon
another
delay
occurred
on
the
roof
the
wanderers
heard
loud
talking
beneath
their
feet
and
concluded
that
the
council
sat
in
a
room
below
and
that
they
would
be
led
before
that
august
body
there
was
some
consolation
in
this
fact
for
it
showed
at
least
that
they
would
not
be
slaughtered
at
once
but
how
should
they
defend
themselves
nobody
understood
their
language
any
more
than
they
understood
that
of
the
tanos
the
situation
seemed
desperate
hayoue
as
well
as
zashue
felt
helpless
but
they
had
to
submit
to
the
inevitable
after
all
death
would
put
an
end
to
everything
it
is
beautiful
at
shipapu
there
is
constant
dancing
and
singing
the
girls
are
always
young
and
the
women
never
too
old
hayoue
hand
was
again
grasped
by
one
of
the
guards
and
he
was
motioned
to
descend
into
the
apartment
below
zashue
had
to
follow
they
found
themselves
in
a
long
room
whose
whitewashed
walls
reflected
the
light
of
a
small
fire
burning
on
a
rude
hearth
close
to
the
hearth
sat
a
man
whom
the
prisoners
at
once
supposed
to
be
the
puyo
or
governor
by
his
side
sat
another
a
small
figure
somewhat
wrinkled
he
wore
nothing
but
a
of
buckskin
for
it
was
summer
several
aged
men
were
gathered
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
fire
although
none
of
them
wore
either
ornaments
or
badges
it
was
easy
to
surmise
that
they
were
the
principal
shamans
along
the
wall
sat
lounged
or
squatted
the
clan
delegates
so
that
all
in
all
there
were
present
about
eighteen
persons
including
the
prisoners
outside
the
faces
and
eyes
of
listeners
appeared
from
time
to
time
through
the
the
man
whom
the
two
queres
rightly
took
to
be
the
civil
chief
motioned
them
adding
sit
down
they
obeyed
and
remained
sitting
with
downcast
looks
the
councilmen
glanced
at
them
furtively
from
time
to
time
none
of
them
spoke
at
last
a
whisper
was
heard
and
now
a
voice
said
in
the
queres
dialect
whither
are
you
going
hayoue
started
and
stared
about
in
the
room
looking
for
the
man
who
in
this
foreign
country
spoke
his
own
language
when
he
finally
discovered
that
it
was
the
small
old
man
sitting
by
the
side
of
the
governor
he
gaped
at
him
with
lips
parted
and
an
expression
akin
to
fright
he
had
acquired
a
dim
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
it
might
be
possible
for
one
man
to
know
more
than
one
language
but
he
had
never
met
such
a
prodigy
as
yet
after
the
first
surprise
was
over
he
still
stared
at
the
speaker
with
inquisitive
glances
eager
to
see
whether
it
was
possible
to
speak
two
dialects
with
one
and
the
same
tongue
zashue
was
less
startled
he
knew
that
there
were
people
who
had
learned
a
speech
different
from
the
one
to
which
they
were
born
therefore
he
replied
to
the
query
we
are
searching
for
our
women
our
daughters
and
our
children
why
do
you
look
for
them
here
we
have
them
not
said
the
old
man
because
we
have
hunted
for
them
everywhere
else
and
have
not
found
them
are
you
alone
continued
his
interlocutor
i
and
my
brother
are
alone
zashue
asserted
why
did
your
koitza
and
makatza
leave
you
the
moshome
drove
them
off
the
moshome
the
inquisitor
criticised
his
words
hayoue
had
recovered
from
his
surprise
he
interjected
in
a
loud
blunt
voice
while
the
men
went
out
to
strike
the
tehuas
the
moshome
dinne
came
upon
us
we
were
only
a
few
and
the
shuatyam
laid
waste
our
corn
and
killed
many
women
many
more
however
fled
we
do
not
know
whither
these
we
have
gone
out
to
find
we
are
looking
for
them
this
day
here
among
you
but
you
have
taken
us
captives
you
have
treated
us
not
as
it
is
customary
between
the
zaashtesh
but
as
the
moshome
are
wont
to
do
when
strangers
come
to
their
hogans
he
looked
down
again
angry
zashue
endeavoured
to
give
him
a
warning
sign
but
hayoue
saw
it
not
the
old
man
smiled
afterward
he
translated
to
the
tanos
what
had
been
said
his
communication
excited
considerable
attention
at
the
close
of
his
speech
one
of
the
replied
in
a
few
words
the
interpreter
turned
again
to
the
queres
asking
why
did
the
people
of
the
tyuonyi
come
upon
our
brethren
in
the
north
by
night
like
shutzuna
the
men
from
the
puye
had
done
them
no
harm
no
harm
hayoue
broke
out
did
they
not
murder
the
best
the
bravest
the
wisest
man
our
father
the
maseua
was
it
not
enough
if
you
do
not
call
that
a
bad
a
base
deed
then
you
and
all
of
you
are
as
bad
and
as
base
as
the
tehuas
the
old
man
features
remained
placid
he
replied
in
a
quiet
tone
but
his
manner
was
cool
and
measured
i
know
that
you
believe
that
the
tehuas
killed
your
maseua
i
know
it
well
for
shotaye
who
now
is
called
aua
quio
and
who
lives
with
cayamo
in
the
homes
at
the
puye
came
to
warn
the
tehuas
that
the
queres
were
coming
over
against
them
but
it
is
not
true
it
was
not
our
brethren
from
the
north
it
was
the
moshome
dinne
he
uttered
the
name
with
marked
emphasis
they
killed
the
maseua
of
your
tribe
we
recognize
in
the
interpreter
the
same
old
man
who
served
the
tehuas
in
their
first
interviews
with
shotaye
the
tehuas
had
despatched
him
to
the
tanos
in
order
to
inform
the
latter
of
their
signal
triumph
and
to
put
them
on
their
guard
against
the
queres
it
was
a
lucky
hour
for
hayoue
and
zashue
especially
for
the
former
when
the
old
man
reached
the
tanos
the
two
adventurers
were
thunderstruck
speechless
with
heads
bowed
they
sat
in
utter
amazement
at
what
they
were
being
told
everything
was
so
completely
new
to
them
and
yet
it
explained
so
much
that
they
were
unable
to
collect
their
minds
at
once
the
tanos
saw
their
confusion
what
the
interpreter
told
them
of
the
replies
of
the
prisoners
had
already
created
much
interest
and
now
their
embarrassed
state
attracted
still
greater
attention
the
interpreter
therefore
was
prompted
to
further
question
them
when
the
queres
moved
against
the
tehuas
were
you
along
no
zashue
replied
sullenly
have
many
of
your
people
returned
from
the
north
enough
to
hold
their
own
against
all
who
speak
your
language
hayoue
retorted
the
old
man
blinked
he
had
put
an
imprudent
question
after
a
short
pause
he
asked
again
why
did
you
alone
go
out
to
seek
for
your
people
because
hayoue
indignantly
retorted
the
others
had
to
remain
at
home
to
protect
the
weak
ones
in
case
the
moshome
tehua
came
for
the
leavings
of
the
moshome
dinne
he
accompanied
these
already
insulting
words
with
looks
of
defiance
glancing
around
with
eyes
flashing
and
lips
scornfully
curled
his
wrath
was
raised
to
the
highest
pitch
he
could
not
control
himself
fortunately
for
him
the
tanos
did
not
understand
his
words
and
the
interpreter
was
shrewd
enough
to
see
that
the
young
man
thought
himself
justly
angry
and
withheld
his
insulting
speech
from
his
listeners
he
comprehended
the
position
of
the
strangers
and
understood
what
their
feelings
must
be
he
had
no
doubt
in
regard
to
their
sincerity
and
truthfulness
an
important
point
which
he
realized
was
the
present
weakened
condition
of
the
queres
tribe
he
turned
to
the
meeting
and
spoke
long
and
earnestly
his
speech
was
followed
with
the
closest
attention
and
zashue
who
felt
more
composed
than
his
younger
brother
noticed
that
the
words
fell
on
ready
ears
a
short
discussion
followed
in
which
every
one
participated
in
turn
at
last
all
seemed
unanimous
and
the
interpreter
avoiding
hayoue
who
sat
with
eyes
gleaming
like
a
loaded
electric
battery
ready
to
send
off
flying
and
burning
sparks
turned
to
zashue
with
the
query
have
you
any
trace
of
your
people
zashue
related
everything
in
a
simple
and
truthful
manner
how
they
came
to
the
determination
to
visit
the
village
with
the
intention
in
case
there
should
be
none
of
the
fugitives
here
to
turn
southward
and
continue
their
search
among
the
southern
pueblos
every
word
he
said
was
afterward
translated
to
the
council
the
tuyo
delivered
a
short
address
and
the
interpreter
spoke
to
the
two
young
men
in
a
solemn
dignified
manner
as
follows
it
is
well
my
brethren
say
that
you
are
welcome
they
also
say
that
you
should
forgive
them
for
having
suspected
you
the
people
on
the
tyuonyi
wronged
those
at
the
puye
and
that
was
not
good
but
now
since
the
hand
of
those
above
has
stricken
the
queres
we
will
no
longer
be
moshome
but
brethren
and
will
forget
what
has
come
between
us
are
we
not
all
one
we
who
wear
the
hair
in
sidelocks
one
from
the
beginning
and
have
we
not
all
come
forth
at
the
same
place
you
are
welcome
the
speaker
paused
glancing
at
the
governor
the
latter
rose
went
over
to
zashue
took
his
hand
breathed
on
it
and
lifted
it
upward
he
did
the
same
to
hayoue
then
he
returned
to
his
seat
and
gave
a
sign
to
the
interpreter
who
went
on
those
whom
you
long
for
are
not
here
but
it
may
be
that
as
you
say
brother
he
directed
these
words
to
zashue
they
went
to
our
people
farther
south
in
a
few
days
i
will
have
to
go
thither
and
will
be
your
guide
meanwhile
eat
the
food
and
drink
the
water
offered
you
by
those
who
speak
a
tongue
different
from
yours
but
whose
hearts
are
like
your
heart
and
who
like
you
pray
to
those
above
he
who
dwells
up
there
is
our
father
and
your
father
she
who
has
her
home
on
high
is
our
mother
and
your
mother
therefore
the
mothers
and
fathers
of
the
tanos
say
to
you
through
me
that
it
is
well
that
you
should
stay
here
be
welcome
involuntarily
zashue
uttered
a
deeply
felt
ho
of
relief
hayoue
nodded
and
sighed
as
if
breathing
freer
again
the
great
arose
scattered
sacred
meal
and
uttered
a
prayer
to
which
all
the
others
listened
in
deep
silence
then
he
went
to
greet
the
strangers
in
the
customary
manner
one
by
one
the
others
followed
the
second
the
other
chief
officials
finally
the
delegates
of
the
clans
every
one
grasped
their
hands
and
went
through
the
same
ceremonies
the
council
was
ended
and
to
every
one
satisfaction
last
came
the
old
interpreter
and
greeted
them
saying
i
am
chang
doa
what
you
call
mokatsh
hanutsh
clan
where
do
you
belong
tzitz
hanutsh
zashue
quickly
responded
the
old
man
turned
to
one
of
the
delegates
father
he
called
to
him
in
his
language
our
sons
belong
to
your
people
will
you
take
them
with
you
or
shall
they
go
to
the
summer
cacique
the
other
reflected
a
short
while
then
he
replied
the
summer
cacique
is
busy
let
the
brethren
come
with
me
i
will
lead
them
to
the
homes
of
doa
news
of
the
happy
result
of
the
council
had
already
spread
outside
when
the
prisoners
of
a
few
hours
ago
now
transformed
into
honoured
guests
stepped
down
into
the
square
every
one
looked
at
them
pleasantly
the
throng
dispersed
but
many
followed
them
into
the
houses
of
the
water
clan
where
they
were
treated
to
the
primitive
food
of
those
times
soon
they
retired
to
rest
on
simple
couches
there
to
forget
the
hardships
and
dangers
they
had
suffered
during
the
day
outside
the
deepest
silence
reigned
the
pueblo
on
the
steep
hill
and
the
desert
plain
below
shone
in
the
rays
of
the
moon
peacefully
as
though
they
too
would
slumber
from
the
thickets
along
the
little
stream
arose
a
faint
twitter
louder
and
louder
it
sounded
and
rose
heavenward
in
full
melodious
strains
soaring
on
high
through
the
stillness
of
the
night
it
was
the
greeting
to
the
hour
of
rest

autumn
in
new
mexico
as
well
as
in
many
other
parts
of
the
world
is
the
most
beautiful
time
of
the
year
the
rains
are
over
and
vegetation
is
refreshed
and
has
developed
yellow
flowers
cover
the
slopes
of
the
higher
ranges
the
summits
are
crowned
with
glistening
snow
again
the
days
are
pleasant
and
the
nights
calm
clear
and
wonderfully
cool
nature
in
autumn
seems
to
display
its
greatest
charms
to
allure
mankind
into
placid
submission
to
the
approach
of
rigid
winter
autumn
has
come
and
the
two
adventurers
of
whose
reception
we
have
spoken
in
the
last
chapter
are
still
guests
kindly
treated
and
waiting
for
the
guide
to
give
the
signal
of
departure
for
the
south
a
few
days
the
old
man
had
said
in
a
few
days
he
would
himself
go
to
the
southern
pueblos
of
his
tribe
but
upon
the
there
followed
ceremonial
dances
which
lasted
for
days
and
hayoue
and
zashue
could
not
leave
until
they
were
over
then
it
required
several
days
to
rest
and
to
perform
certain
rites
and
zashue
and
hayoue
could
not
leave
on
that
account
furthermore
zashue
being
koshare
the
koshare
of
the
tanos
held
him
back
for
certain
performances
of
their
own
and
hayoue
could
not
or
would
not
start
alone
afterward
hayoue
being
cuirana
the
cuirana
held
something
in
store
for
him
and
zashue
did
not
care
to
start
without
his
brother
and
when
all
that
was
finished
the
old
man
was
not
ready
and
so
they
are
waiting
and
waiting
and
autumn
is
here
in
all
its
beauty
and
hayoue
and
zashue
zashue
as
well
as
hayoue
begin
to
chafe
but
it
is
of
no
avail
they
must
wait
while
they
are
thus
waiting
until
it
pleases
their
friend
to
start
we
shall
precede
them
to
that
south
which
is
their
objective
point
in
order
to
anticipate
if
possible
the
cravings
of
the
two
adventurous
young
men
they
may
overtake
us
there
perhaps
when
we
least
expect
it
about
thirty
miles
south
of
santa
fé
the
southern
rim
of
the
basin
of
galisteo
is
bounded
by
a
low
and
shaggy
ridge
running
from
east
to
west
whose
crest
is
formed
of
sharply
though
irregularly
dentated
in
spanish
this
ridge
and
another
similar
one
which
traverses
the
plain
several
miles
north
of
it
running
parallel
to
the
former
is
called
very
appropriately
el
creston
for
if
seen
from
a
distance
and
edgewise
it
strikingly
resembles
the
crest
of
an
antique
helmet
the
plain
of
galisteo
expands
between
and
on
the
edges
of
it
stand
several
villages
of
the
tanos
of
the
galisteo
basin
a
spanish
report
from
the
sixteenth
century
says
there
they
have
no
stream
neither
are
there
any
running
brooks
nor
any
springs
which
the
people
could
use
the
mountain
clusters
of
the
real
de
dolores
and
sierra
de
san
francisco
and
beyond
these
the
high
sandia
chain
divide
the
galisteo
country
from
the
valley
of
the
rio
grande
in
the
west
to
the
south
there
extends
a
dreary
plain
as
far
as
the
salt
marshes
of
the
manzano
eastward
spread
the
wooded
slopes
of
the
plateau
above
the
pecos
border
upon
the
basin
to
the
north
the
plain
rises
gradually
traversed
only
by
the
northern
until
it
merges
into
the
plain
of
santa
fé
on
the
southwestern
corner
of
the
galisteo
basin
a
broad
channel
discharges
its
waters
into
it
passing
between
the
san
francisco
range
and
the
mountains
of
dolores
the
channel
is
arid
mountain
torrents
rush
through
it
only
in
the
season
of
thunderstorms
and
they
have
burrowed
and
ploughed
through
its
surface
scarring
it
with
deep
furrows
and
shifting
waterfalls
near
the
mouth
of
the
pass
and
at
no
great
distance
from
the
plain
one
of
these
arroyos
has
cut
through
an
ancient
village
exposing
on
both
banks
the
lower
walls
and
rooms
of
its
buildings
visible
on
the
surface
only
as
irregular
lines
and
quadrangles
of
rubbish
the
village
must
have
been
quite
large
for
an
indian
settlement
since
seven
rectangles
with
additions
can
still
be
traced
this
village
in
ruins
is
called
the
pueblo
largo
and
the
name
is
not
inappropriate
at
the
time
of
which
we
speak
the
pueblo
largo
was
inhabited
and
in
as
high
a
state
of
prosperity
as
indian
pueblos
ever
attain
unto
it
contained
as
the
ruins
attest
nearly
fifteen
hundred
people
of
the
tanos
tribe
its
name
was
hishi
the
name
is
well
known
to
the
remnants
of
the
tanos
for
they
have
piously
preserved
the
recollections
of
their
former
abodes
hishi
is
not
on
a
beautiful
site
it
lies
in
a
wide
ditch
rather
than
in
a
valley
no
view
opens
from
it
and
sombre
mountains
loom
up
in
close
proximity
both
to
the
north
and
west
in
the
rear
of
the
village
the
soil
rises
gradually
to
a
low
series
of
ridges
from
the
top
of
which
at
some
distance
from
hishi
the
eye
ranges
far
off
toward
the
plains
and
the
basin
of
the
salt
lakes
these
ridges
are
convenient
posts
of
observation
scouts
placed
there
can
descry
the
approach
of
hostile
apaches
the
latter
roam
up
and
down
the
plains
following
the
immense
herds
of
buffalo
and
prey
upon
the
village
indians
whenever
the
latter
present
any
opportunity
for
a
successful
surprise
the
buffalo
himself
not
infrequently
comes
to
graze
within
a
short
distance
of
hishi
south
of
the
present
ruins
lies
the
buffalo
spring
when
the
dark
masses
of
this
greatest
of
american
quadrupeds
are
descried
from
the
heights
above
the
village
the
tanos
go
out
with
bow
and
arrow
and
woe
to
the
straggling
steer
or
calf
that
lags
behind
like
the
wolf
the
indian
rarely
attacked
any
but
isolated
animals
only
when
a
communal
hunt
was
organized
and
a
whole
village
sallied
forth
to
make
war
upon
the
mighty
king
of
the
prairies
only
then
previous
to
the
introduction
of
could
the
redman
venture
to
assault
even
a
small
herd
or
the
of
a
numerous
column
september
is
drawing
to
a
close
and
the
autumnal
sky
is
as
cloudless
and
as
pure
over
hishi
as
it
is
over
most
of
the
other
portions
of
new
mexico
but
in
the
hollow
where
the
village
is
situated
the
sun
is
scorching
as
hishi
lies
much
lower
than
the
corner
in
the
east
and
lower
than
the
rito
the
chaparro
flowers
in
dense
masses
of
deep
yellow
carpet
the
earth
and
the
dark
pine
forests
on
the
stare
while
yellow
streaks
sweep
up
among
the
dusky
timber
in
the
distance
we
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
eastern
slope
of
the
sandia
range
glistening
in
the
bright
yellow
hue
of
the
flowers
that
cover
miles
of
its
slanting
surface
on
the
ridges
south
of
hishi
human
figures
stand
they
are
scattered
watching
and
spying
attentively
they
are
videttes
outposts
placed
to
scan
the
plains
and
the
slopes
of
the
mountains
lest
some
enemy
sneak
up
and
pounce
upon
the
defenceless
village
for
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
speaking
the
tanos
or
hishi
are
not
only
defenceless
but
singularly
unsuspecting
and
heedless
of
danger
they
would
be
at
the
mercy
of
an
enemy
were
it
not
for
these
guards
and
scouts
who
watch
and
pry
straining
every
organ
of
perception
that
their
people
at
home
may
be
without
care
while
singing
praying
and
making
merry
is
not
the
dance
now
going
on
at
the
village
danced
prayed
and
sung
for
their
benefit
also
whenever
these
outposts
turn
toward
their
pueblo
they
see
clouds
of
dust
rising
from
it
hear
loud
rhythmic
shouting
whoops
and
yells
beating
of
drums
and
the
shrill
sounds
of
flutes
a
haze
seems
to
cover
the
tall
and
long
terraced
buildings
quite
distinct
from
the
vertical
columns
of
that
drift
over
the
plain
of
galisteo
in
calm
weather
rising
above
the
horizon
like
thin
films
of
smoke
it
is
a
great
day
at
hishi
a
dance
is
performed
songs
are
sung
and
prayers
and
sacrifices
are
offered
that
shall
be
powerful
with
those
above
the
people
make
merry
over
the
fruits
of
the
soil
that
have
now
matured
they
are
grateful
and
they
wish
to
be
precious
to
the
higher
powers
in
years
to
come
the
great
harvest
dance
is
performed
a
long
procession
perambulates
the
long
village
the
koshare
trot
ahead
they
are
the
same
black
and
white
goblins
with
whom
we
are
already
acquainted
but
their
bodies
are
decorated
now
with
ripe
fruit
with
small
squashes
and
ears
of
corn
all
strung
to
cords
of
fibre
or
buckskin
and
hung
over
their
shoulders
like
wreaths
wild
sunflowers
adorn
their
heads
they
are
followed
by
the
cuirana
whose
bodies
are
daubed
over
with
bluish
clay
then
the
general
public
tramp
along
the
procession
is
divided
into
four
sections
the
faces
of
all
being
painted
the
first
detachment
is
led
by
an
old
man
whose
hair
supports
a
wreath
of
yellow
blossoms
he
is
the
summer
cacique
the
winter
cacique
leads
on
the
second
group
behind
each
ear
he
wears
a
tall
plume
from
the
wings
of
the
eagle
and
around
his
neck
are
strung
rows
upon
rows
of
sacred
shell
beads
turquoises
and
gaudy
pebbles
the
third
is
preceded
by
the
great
shaman
of
the
hunt
his
dress
is
a
suit
of
buckskin
long
fringes
depend
from
his
sleeves
and
the
front
and
shoulders
of
his
jacket
are
profusely
embroidered
with
a
small
plumelet
of
dances
over
his
head
the
last
section
is
led
by
the
highest
shaman
his
head
is
also
decorated
with
yellow
flowers
and
a
green
and
a
yellow
plume
stand
erect
behind
each
ear
the
war
shaman
is
not
to
be
seen
the
spirits
of
strife
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
feast
of
peace
the
war
captain
and
his
assistants
accompany
the
procession
to
keep
order
and
clear
the
way
this
long
long
pageant
winds
on
meandering
through
the
pueblo
to
the
sound
of
drums
of
flutes
and
of
monotonous
chants
the
white
satyrs
go
ahead
then
follow
the
blue
ones
then
come
in
single
file
the
men
vigorously
stamping
and
behind
each
a
woman
tripping
lightly
every
man
is
loaded
with
fruit
of
some
kind
and
carries
corn
and
squashes
also
in
each
hand
every
woman
or
girl
bears
on
her
head
a
basket
of
willows
or
yucca
filled
with
yucca
preserve
and
other
delicacies
products
of
the
vegetable
kingdom
it
is
a
procession
of
baskets
filing
through
hishi
solemn
and
sober
and
in
the
main
extremely
monotonous
at
intervals
the
koshare
break
ranks
to
cut
a
few
capers
but
the
delight
makers
of
the
tehuas
are
remarkably
decent
for
they
are
those
par
excellence
who
say
grace
since
their
labours
have
been
rewarded
and
the
crops
are
now
ripe
and
the
people
have
sufficient
food
they
are
merry
in
the
prospects
of
an
easy
winter
and
there
is
no
need
of
any
artificial
the
procession
has
passed
through
the
entire
village
and
returned
to
one
of
its
main
squares
the
end
of
the
pageant
is
still
on
the
march
when
the
koshare
break
ranks
again
and
cluster
in
the
centre
of
the
square
from
every
side
bystanders
come
up
with
fruits
scattering
them
over
the
ground
where
the
delight
makers
are
waiting
and
when
the
soil
is
well
covered
with
squash
corn
and
other
vegetables
the
white
satyrs
begin
to
dance
with
the
most
serious
faces
singing
and
lifting
their
hands
to
the
skies
gradually
the
whole
of
the
offering
is
crushed
and
at
last
pounded
into
the
earth
by
the
feet
of
the
dancing
clowns

in
token
of
gratitude
returns
a
tribute
to
the
earth
as
soon
as
this
part
of
the
ceremony
is
over
there
arises
a
great
shout
from
all
sides
ears
of
corn
gourds
cakes
of
corn
meal
pieces
of
dried
preserve
ripe
fruits
of
the
yucca
are
thrown
up
into
the
air
the
baskets
are
emptied
and
bystanders
run
home
to
replenish
them
whoever
can
catch
anything
proceeds
to
devour
it
at
once
the
whole
tribe
displays
its
gratitude
by
throwing
heavenward
the
food
which
heaven
has
enabled
it
to
raise
man
intercepts
and
enjoys
it
after
the
will
and
the
deed
have
satisfied
the
invisible
powers
on
high
the
usual
mass
of
spectators
are
gathered
on
the
roofs
and
along
the
walls
of
the
houses
when
the
noisy
distribution
of
offerings
begins
many
run
to
get
their
share
but
it
is
not
those
who
are
most
eager
that
are
most
considered
it
seems
that
the
bulk
of
the
food
thrown
into
the
air
is
showering
down
upon
a
row
of
houses
on
whose
terraces
stands
a
group
of
men
women
and
children
who
seem
no
part
of
the
inhabitants
of
hishi
manifesting
this
not
so
much
in
dress
as
from
their
distant
and
timid
deportment
all
of
them
are
very
poorly
clad
the
children
mostly
naked
and
yet
here
and
there
a
girl
among
them
wears
a
new
hide
and
some
old
woman
a
new
white
cotton
wrap
their
pieces
of
clothing
appear
like
new
mendings
on
old
rags
or
like
a
substantial
shawl
thrown
over
scanty
vestments
the
older
members
of
this
peculiar
group
look
down
upon
the
merry
spectacle
below
with
grave
and
melancholy
eyes
the
younger
would
fain
be
merry
also
but
sadness
lurks
in
their
smiles
the
children
alone
yield
fully
to
the
excitement
and
happiness
of
the
hour
as
the
gifts
fall
down
from
above
the
older
ones
do
not
attempt
to
seize
them
the
girls
and
younger
women
gather
what
they
can
and
place
them
carefully
in
a
heap
what
the
children
do
not
succeed
in
devouring
at
once
is
taken
away
from
them
and
placed
with
the
rest
they
are
improving
the
opportunity
to
lay
in
stores
and
the
tanos
lend
them
a
willing
hand
spectators
below
turn
over
to
them
what
has
fallen
to
their
share
others
place
what
they
have
secured
with
the
little
hoard
the
strangers
are
accumulating
for
these
people
so
poorly
clad
and
looking
so
needy
must
be
strangers
in
the
village
of
hishi
strangers
yes
but
strangers
in
need
and
could
there
be
any
sacrifice
any
offering
more
agreeable
to
those
on
high
than
the
feeding
of
people
whom
they
allow
to
live
by
thrusting
them
on
the
charity
of
these
strangers
are
after
all
but
children
of
the
same
spiritual
parents
from
the
upper
world
and
as
such
they
are
brothers
sisters
and
relatives
that
the
strangers
are
village
indians
can
easily
be
seen
it
is
proved
by
the
cut
of
the
hair
and
by
the
rags
which
still
protect
their
bodies
from
absolute
nakedness
but
the
tongue
they
speak
is
different
from
that
spoken
by
the
people
of
hishi
to
us
however
it
is
not
new
we
have
heard
that
dialect
before
it
is
the
queres
language
the
language
of
the
rito
the
strangers
are
the
lost
ones
whom
hayoue
and
zashue
have
sought
so
anxiously
and
with
so
much
suffering
and
for
the
sake
of
whom
they
have
exposed
their
lives
a
hundred
times
perhaps
in
vain
zashue
was
right
the
fugitives
had
turned
south
from
the
bocas
and
had
hayoue
been
less
they
would
have
found
them
ere
now
still
we
miss
among
that
little
band
of
queres
fugitives
those
with
whom
we
have
become
more
closely
acquainted
illustration
ruins
of
an
ancient
pueblo
in
vain
we
look
for
say
koitza
for
mitsha
for
okoya
can
it
be
true
as
hayoue
surmised
that
his
bosom
friend
zashue
eldest
son
is
dead
the
throwing
about
of
fruit
has
ceased
the
dance
is
resumed
and
new
figures
may
appear
everybody
hushes
and
fastens
his
gaze
on
the
performance
the
dancers
have
formed
a
wide
ring
men
and
women
hold
each
other
by
the
hands
and
dance
in
a
circle
around
the
place
which
has
been
covered
with
objects
of
sacrifice
one
after
the
other
the
koshare
the
cuirana
after
them
each
one
of
the
four
sections
step
within
the
circle
stamping
down
the
fruits
spread
out
there
two
or
three
of
the
delight
makers
improve
the
occasion
to
cut
some
of
their
usual
capers
and
the
spectators
laugh
to
their
heart
content
laughter
is
contagious
it
captures
even
the
melancholy
group
of
queres
the
old
among
them
smile
the
young
chuckle
the
children
shout
and
yell
from
sheer
delight
one
boy
in
particular
is
very
conspicuous
from
the
intense
interest
he
takes
in
everything
the
koshare
are
doing
he
is
about
ten
years
of
age
a
dirty
constitutes
his
only
vestment
but
a
necklace
of
pebbles
adorns
his
neck
and
as
often
as
a
koshare
grimaces
or
makes
an
extraordinary
gesture
or
displays
his
tongue
to
the
public
this
boy
jumps
up
screams
and
shouts
and
screeches
in
delirious
joy
his
whole
heart
is
with
the
koshare
he
imitates
their
movements
improves
on
their
gestures
to
such
a
degree
that
those
around
him
smile
exchanging
winks
of
approval
as
if
saying
he
will
be
a
good
one
the
head
of
a
girl
slowly
rises
through
a
hatchway
and
as
her
face
turns
toward
us
we
recognize
the
soft
beaming
eyes
of
mitsha
koitza
the
maiden
looks
thinner
her
features
sharper
she
remains
standing
on
the
notched
beam
serving
as
a
ladder
and
calls
out
shyuote
no
reply
is
made
to
the
call
the
din
and
noise
of
the
dance
drown
her
voice
and
all
are
so
occupied
by
the
sights
that
none
pay
any
attention
to
her
the
youngster
who
has
been
devoting
all
his
time
to
the
pranks
of
the
delight
makers
jumps
forward
in
his
enthusiasm
and
would
have
tumbled
sheer
over
the
low
parapet
encircling
the
roof
had
not
one
of
the
men
standing
near
grasped
his
hair
and
pulled
him
back
it
saved
the
boy
life
but
the
urchin
is
highly
displeased
at
the
informal
manner
in
which
he
is
restrained
he
screams
and
struggles
to
free
himself
again
the
voice
of
the
maiden
is
heard
this
time
it
is
louder
and
the
tone
commanding
shyuote
she
is
calling
you
uak
the
man
says
who
has
saved
the
brat
i
wo
go
retorts
our
old
friend
shyuote
for
he
it
is
who
attempts
to
play
at
koshare
here
shyuote
come
to
sanaya
again
calls
the
maiden
the
mention
of
his
mother
creates
a
stir
among
the
bystanders
they
forget
the
dance
and
turn
toward
mitsha
shyuote
still
refuses
to
obey
but
the
others
push
him
forcibly
to
the
hatchway
several
of
the
women
approach
mitsha
and
one
inquires
of
her
in
a
subdued
voice
how
goes
it
below
the
girl
eyes
fill
with
tears
at
last
she
whispers
it
goes
to
shipapu
she
turns
around
and
disappears
beneath
sobbing
shyuote
is
sent
after
her
the
people
stand
and
shake
their
heads
the
news
wanders
from
lip
to
lip
she
is
dying
all
the
pleasure
every
interest
in
the
performance
has
vanished
indifferent
to
the
celebration
the
queres
hang
their
heads
in
sadness
yet
no
complaint
is
heard
not
a
tear
glistens
in
those
mournful
eyes
she
is
only
dying
not
dead
but
who
is
dying
the
query
can
not
be
answered
up
here
let
us
go
down
and
follow
mitsha
in
the
dingy
room
of
an
indian
home
where
light
and
air
penetrate
through
a
single
diminutive
sit
and
crouch
half
a
dozen
people
they
surround
at
some
distance
a
human
being
whose
head
rests
on
a
bundle
of
skins
the
body
on
a
the
knees
are
drawn
up
and
cotton
mantles
cover
the
lower
extremities
the
chest
scantily
covered
with
a
ragged
wrap
heaves
at
long
intervals
the
extremities
begin
to
stretch
the
face
is
devoid
of
expression
the
eyes
are
wide
open
staring
glassy
the
lips
parted
and
on
each
side
of
the
ominous
wrinkles
begin
to
form
the
sufferer
is
a
woman
and
as
we
look
closer
we
recognize
her
as
say
koitza
the
wife
of
zashue
he
must
hasten
his
steps
if
he
wishes
to
find
her
upon
earth
for
she
is
dying
it
is
very
still
in
the
room
the
prayers
which
the
of
the
tanos
has
been
reciting
are
hushed
the
little
idols
of
lava
with
faces
and
eyes
made
of
turquoises
by
means
of
which
he
hoped
to
conjure
the
sickness
lean
against
the
wall
useless
those
whose
duty
it
is
cower
about
the
dying
woman
and
look
on
speechless
how
faint
the
breathings
grow
how
the
chest
rises
and
falls
at
longer
intervals
weaker
every
time
they
listen
as
the
rattling
in
her
throat
becomes
harder
and
slower
they
dare
not
weep
for
all
is
not
over
say
koitza
is
dying
not
the
sudden
death
she
once
prayed
for
when
topanashka
her
father
went
over
to
shipapu
but
still
she
dies
a
painless
death
she
dies
from
exhaustion
what
is
going
on
in
her
mind
while
the
fetters
which
tied
her
soul
to
the
body
are
being
dissolved
that
body
is
henceforth
powerless
it
has
no
wants
no
cravings
the
soul
becomes
free
can
it
already
glance
beyond
not
yet
for
as
long
as
earthly
matter
clings
to
him
man
can
not
perceive
the
other
world
flashes
of
light
gleam
through
the
mist
in
which
he
is
plunged
through
both
physical
weakness
and
the
efforts
of
the
soul
to
become
free
the
body
struggles
for
preservation
the
spirit
for
freedom
from
its
henceforth
useless
shell
are
mind
and
body
merely
one
does
not
death
put
an
end
to
everything
that
we
ever
were
and
can
be
does
there
remain
after
death
anything
beyond
the
memory
of
our
former
existence
preserved
in
the
hearts
of
our
nobody
has
ever
returned
from
beyond
the
grave
to
tell
us
how
he
felt
what
he
thought
while
dying
but
a
dying
person
always
casts
rays
of
light
over
his
surroundings
and
the
surroundings
of
dying
say
koitza
are
not
without
their
lesson
for
us
what
do
we
see
a
man
sits
near
the
dying
woman
he
lifts
up
his
hands
and
stares
it
is
the
and
he
has
done
his
utmost
he
is
powerless
his
art
useless
what
he
did
was
done
in
the
conviction
that
spiritual
influences
however
grossly
conceived
and
coarsely
applied
could
compel
the
soul
to
master
the
body
ailment
could
prop
up
the
sinking
machinery
and
strengthen
the
motive
power
without
regard
to
its
decaying
tools
provided
the
body
is
helped
along
with
physical
means
the
soul
would
remain
against
its
will
or
against
the
will
of
what
stands
in
closer
relation
to
it
originally
than
the
form
which
it
has
animated
here
beneath
if
mind
and
body
were
one
either
method
could
be
successful
neither
is
when
death
steps
in
to
proclaim
their
separation
by
the
side
of
the
shaman
a
young
man
leans
against
the
wall
he
is
and
lithe
his
head
is
bent
so
low
in
grief
that
the
dark
hair
streams
over
his
face
concealing
his
features
the
youth
is
mourning
mourning
deeply
over
what
over
the
body
or
its
sufferings
no
he
mourns
because
of
an
impending
separation
from
what
from
the
form
of
her
whom
he
will
miss
no
for
that
form
will
not
leave
this
earth
in
substance
he
mourns
for
something
that
goes
beyond
his
grasp
and
remains
beyond
it
so
long
as
he
himself
moves
upon
this
earth
mitsha
also
is
here
she
has
properly
no
right
to
be
for
she
does
not
belong
to
the
same
clan
as
say
but
she
has
remained
and
nobody
has
objected
to
her
presence
she
has
not
craved
permission
it
has
come
by
tacit
consent
mitsha
has
felt
that
say
was
approaching
the
point
when
the
soul
breaks
loose
and
flits
to
another
realm
and
she
wishes
to
remain
with
her
to
the
last
if
that
soul
should
drop
like
a
shrivelled
fruit
to
decay
and
perish
forever
nobody
would
bend
to
gaze
fondly
at
it
but
if
it
flutter
upward
we
follow
it
with
our
eyes
as
long
as
we
can
unconsciously
thinking
how
happy
you
are
free
now
and
how
much
i
wish
to
be
with
you
the
very
grief
caused
by
the
separation
the
longing
the
clinging
to
him
or
to
her
whom
we
know
to
be
leaving
us
are
signs
that
there
is
something
beyond
something
which
we
are
loath
to
lose
but
sure
to
find
again
elsewhere
mitsha
has
known
mother
but
little
but
the
fearful
distress
of
the
past
two
months
has
brought
them
together
at
last
now
the
girl
weeps
but
not
loudly
at
the
thought
of
separation
if
death
be
annihilation
tears
are
of
no
avail
but
if
death
be
a
promise
of
life
in
another
condition
then
child
well
may
you
shed
tears
for
your
grief
is
a
token
of
hope
shyuote
stands
at
the
foot
of
the
beam
gaping
his
mother
lies
so
still
she
breathes
so
loudly
how
well
she
must
be
sleeping
why
did
they
call
him
down
at
all
it
would
have
been
much
nicer
upstairs
where
there
are
koshare
to
be
seen
he
knows
well
enough
that
sanaya
is
sick
but
as
long
as
she
has
such
good
rest
she
ought
to
feel
well
a
child
is
not
afraid
of
a
dying
mother
and
when
she
has
breathed
her
last
is
convinced
that
she
must
be
happy
to
be
well
is
compatible
in
the
minds
of
children
only
with
life
death
therefore
appears
to
them
as
a
step
into
a
better
and
more
beautiful
existence
children
and
fools
tell
the
truth
the
gleam
of
light
which
from
dying
say
is
cast
on
her
unruly
son
is
but
the
rosy
hue
of
a
hopeful
twilight
the
remaining
occupants
of
the
room
stand
with
sad
looks
they
are
all
women
but
one
a
man
they
do
not
feel
the
occasion
except
so
far
as
there
is
a
certain
solemnity
connected
with
it
silent
and
grave
they
watch
a
process
going
on
whose
real
nature
they
can
not
understand
except
as
a
momentous
and
appalling
change
change
is
only
transformation
not
annihilation
say
koitza
has
been
lying
thus
for
several
days
the
end
is
near
at
hand
and
yet
hours
may
elapse
ere
she
dies
so
still
it
is
in
the
apartment
that
nobody
dares
even
move
rising
and
falling
come
the
song
and
the
noise
of
the
dance
from
the
outside
but
they
seem
to
halt
at
the
little
opening
as
if
an
invisible
medium
would
interpose
itself
saying
stay
out
for
within
there
ripens
a
fruit
for
another
and
a
better
world
mitsha
glides
over
to
the
young
man
with
the
dark
streaming
hair
and
touches
his
arm
lightly
he
looks
up
and
at
her
it
is
okoya
okoya
whom
we
believed
to
be
dead
but
who
stands
here
by
the
side
of
his
dying
mother
he
also
looks
emaciated
and
wan
after
all
the
dangers
and
misery
of
a
protracted
flight
this
hour
has
come
upon
him
the
eyes
of
the
two
meet
their
looks
express
neither
tenderness
nor
passion
but
a
perfect
understanding
that
betokens
a
union
which
even
death
can
not
destroy
it
is
that
simple
natural
attachment
which
forms
the
basis
of
indian
wedlock
when
the
parties
are
congenial
to
each
other
that
the
two
are
one
can
be
plainly
seen
as
yet
no
outward
sanction
has
been
given
to
their
union
but
they
are
tacitly
regarded
as
belonging
to
each
other
and
no
opposition
is
offered
to
an
intimacy
which
lacks
but
the
bond
of
marriage
passion
has
little
to
do
with
that
intimacy
the
severe
trials
of
the
past
have
riveted
them
together
on
a
higher
plane
mitsha
has
made
a
sign
to
the
young
man
both
steal
from
the
chamber
noiselessly
and
climb
to
the
roof
he
goes
first
and
she
follows
as
is
customary
among
indians
once
up
there
the
dance
attracts
attention
for
a
moment
he
has
not
seen
anything
of
it
as
yet
for
all
day
he
has
remained
by
his
mother
side
shyuote
improves
the
opportunity
to
slip
out
also
as
he
sees
his
brother
and
future
go
out
he
follows
why
should
he
stay
down
any
longer
his
mother
is
well
she
sleeps
soundly
and
breathes
so
loud
she
certainly
is
improving
and
up
there
he
can
see
koshare
but
he
is
careful
not
to
let
mitsha
see
him
her
positive
ways
are
distasteful
so
he
creeps
in
among
the
spectators
where
her
eyes
can
not
follow
and
soon
has
lost
sight
of
everything
in
contemplation
of
the
koshare
the
appearance
of
okoya
and
mitsha
on
the
roof
attracts
no
attention
as
long
as
the
is
not
sounded
none
but
those
of
her
clan
have
a
right
to
be
with
the
dying
still
one
or
other
of
the
women
casts
an
inquisitive
glance
at
mitsha
a
slight
shake
of
her
head
is
sufficient
answer
to
them
the
young
pair
go
to
one
side
he
sits
down
on
the
parapet
of
the
roof
and
she
beside
him
their
eyes
follow
the
dance
but
their
thoughts
are
elsewhere
okoya
whispers
at
last
sanaya
is
dying
mitsha
nods
and
tears
come
to
her
eyes
here
she
is
not
afraid
to
weep
okoya
continues
i
knew
it
would
happen
yonder
he
points
at
the
mountains
i
heard
the
owl
and
i
knew
it
meant
what
is
now
coming
upon
us
the
girl
shudders
she
weeps
no
longer
dread
scenes
of
the
past
are
looming
up
before
her
mind
in
the
kote
says
she
it
was
very
bad
do
you
remember
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
great
river
on
the
mesa
from
which
one
can
see
so
very
far
almost
over
where
we
are
now
not
as
far
as
that
replied
okoya
in
a
quiet
tone
but
far
enough
you
are
right
makatza
on
the
mesa
we
suffered
much
there
the
moshome
did
us
a
great
deal
of
harm
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
we
should
not
be
here
for
me
mitsha
asked
in
surprise
yes
you
you
saved
me
saved
the
yaya
saved
shyuote
from
the
fierce
shuatyam
yes
surely
he
continued
as
the
girl
shook
her
head
incredulously
do
you
remember
sa
uishe
when
one
moshome
was
holding
my
hands
while
another
struck
at
me
with
his
club
you
took
a
big
stone
and
hit
him
so
that
he
fell
and
i
could
kill
the
other
afterward
you
took
the
bow
away
from
the
dead
moshome
and
you
did
as
much
with
it
as
i
did
with
mine
yes
indeed
you
are
strong
but
you
are
wise
too
and
good
he
fastened
his
eyes
on
her
with
a
deep
earnest
look
and
the
girl
turned
away
her
face
she
felt
embarrassed
we
shall
be
happy
when
you
have
built
your
house
and
you
dwell
in
it
as
my
koitza
okoya
whispered
mitsha
cast
her
eyes
to
the
ground
and
a
faint
glow
appeared
on
her
bronzed
cheeks
the
young
man
was
not
misled
by
her
manner
he
knew
well
enough
that
she
liked
him
to
speak
in
this
way
sanaya
goes
to
shipapu
said
he
moving
closer
to
her
and
i
must
have
a
koitza
you
said
you
would
be
mine
and
i
should
be
your
husband
it
was
the
night
of
the
council
on
the
tyuonyi
do
you
remember
i
do
and
so
it
will
be
she
said
raising
her
head
her
large
eyes
beamed
upon
him
with
an
expression
of
softness
and
deep
joy
but
whither
shall
we
go
here
we
are
strangers
and
the
puyatye
although
they
are
very
good
to
us
speak
a
tongue
we
do
not
understand
shall
we
return
to
the
tyuonyi
and
live
with
my
mother
and
the
hanutsh
are
you
sure
that
your
mother
is
still
alive
are
you
sure
that
there
is
a
single
one
of
our
people
alive
okoya
objected
again
the
eyes
of
mitsha
grew
moist
she
turned
her
head
away
and
okoya
heard
her
sobs
well
did
he
understand
her
grief
it
was
stirred
for
the
fate
of
her
parents
had
he
had
she
known
all
that
had
happened
on
the
rito
a
tremendous
shout
arose
from
the
dancing
crowd
below
the
distribution
of
gifts
was
beginning
anew
again
the
majority
of
the
missiles
were
directed
toward
the
queres
a
perfect
shower
of
provisions
cooked
and
raw
pattered
down
upon
the
strangers
a
large
ear
of
corn
tumbled
into
mitsha
lap
and
she
handed
it
to
okoya
whispering
the
shiuana
are
good
they
are
they
are
good
also
to
the
yaya
for
they
take
her
away
to
shipapu
where
there
is
no
hunger
as
on
the
shore
of
the
great
stream
he
sighed
and
gazed
to
the
west
where
the
san
francisco
mountains
stood
beyond
them
along
the
northern
base
of
the
sierra
de
sandia
in
the
sandy
bottom
of
the
rio
grande
uninhabited
at
this
time
they
had
suffered
from
hunger
and
heat
there
misery
had
reached
its
climax
it
is
terrible
even
in
our
days
to
be
compelled
to
flee
from
house
and
home
in
time
of
war
into
the
cold
strange
world
and
yet
nowadays
one
can
flee
to
one
kind
and
where
there
are
human
beings
there
are
hearts
but
in
the
days
of
old
and
for
indians
it
was
not
only
distressing
it
was
ghastly
to
be
obliged
to
fly
nature
alone
stared
them
in
the
face
and
nature
has
no
heart
although
it
is
said
that
we
are
one
with
her
the
navajos
had
driven
away
the
fugitives
had
tracked
and
tormented
them
fearfully
and
yet
once
relieved
from
the
enemy
clutches
and
thrust
upon
nature
alone
the
wretched
band
regretted
the
days
when
the
ruthless
enemy
swarmed
about
them
the
moshome
at
least
fed
those
whom
they
captured
and
those
whom
they
killed
were
happy
forever
nature
knows
but
law
and
force
and
whoever
depends
upon
her
at
a
time
when
her
laws
will
not
tolerate
the
existence
of
man
falls
a
victim
to
the
power
of
her
forces
now
all
this
was
past
it
rained
gifts
about
them
and
with
a
sad
smile
mitsha
gathered
them
into
a
little
pile
okoya
looked
on
he
thought
the
girl
was
making
provision
for
their
future
household
the
distribution
stopped
for
the
dancers
were
resting
they
began
to
sit
down
along
the
walls
of
the
houses
to
rest
and
to
enjoy
the
needed
recess
mitsha
took
some
of
the
fruit
on
her
arm
and
said
to
okoya
come
let
us
go
down
again
what
do
you
want
to
do
with
that
asked
he
designating
her
little
burden
i
give
it
to
the
chayan
for
what
the
shiuana
are
doing
for
our
mother
even
in
the
state
of
most
abject
poverty
the
indian
shows
gratitude
to
those
above
the
head
of
a
man
rises
above
the
hatchway
and
signals
the
two
young
people
gravely
sadly
they
descend
hastily
okoya
remains
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
mitsha
goes
over
to
him
as
soon
as
she
has
deposited
her
burden
as
nobody
notices
her
she
grasps
his
hand
and
he
presses
it
softly
with
his
own
say
koitza
remains
in
the
same
position
as
before
but
she
lies
more
extended
and
her
chest
heaves
no
longer
the
bystanders
are
motionless
like
statues
expectant
a
last
rattle
sounds
from
the
throat
of
the
woman
a
deep
heavy
effort
and
all
is
over
light
froth
issues
from
her
lips
say
koitza
has
breathed
her
last
it
has
become
very
quiet
outside
as
if
men
there
had
guessed
at
what
was
going
on
within
in
the
little
apartment
it
is
as
still
as
the
grave
a
stillness
which
speaks
louder
to
the
heart
than
the
mightiest
sound
and
which
is
appropriately
designated
by
the
popular
saying
there
is
an
angel
flitting
through
the
room
this
stillness
might
have
lasted
long
but
now
the
noise
and
uproar
arise
again
outside
and
with
full
power
the
sounds
of
delight
and
mirth
break
into
the
dingy
cell
like
mighty
waves
with
the
departure
of
life
from
the
body
it
is
as
if
a
barrier
that
forbade
entrance
to
noise
from
the
outer
world
had
been
drawn
away
permitting
the
sounds
of
joy
to
come
in
triumphantly
now
that
the
soul
is
free
they
find
an
echo
inside
a
dismal
echo
of
lamentations
and
tears
mitsha
can
not
weep
boisterously
like
the
rest
neither
can
okoya
the
two
lean
toward
each
other
sobbing
the
girl
has
grasped
his
arm
with
both
hands
her
head
rests
on
his
shoulder
and
she
weeps
the
lament
below
has
been
heard
on
the
roof
it
is
a
signal
to
rush
down
and
join
in
it
soon
the
room
is
crowded
with
people
the
women
grasp
their
hair
and
pull
it
over
their
faces
dismal
wailing
fills
the
cell
among
the
others
stands
shyuote
who
has
been
told
that
his
mother
is
dead
he
plants
himself
squarely
with
the
rest
and
howls
at
the
top
of
his
voice
in
front
of
the
house
the
dance
continues
and
the
monotonous
chant
and
the
dull
drumming
ascend
to
the
sky
alongside
of
it
the
tanos
also
crowd
into
the
room
the
throng
is
so
great
that
the
last
comers
must
stand
on
the
beam
suddenly
they
are
pushed
aside
a
tall
young
man
rushes
down
and
makes
room
regardless
of
the
weeping
and
howling
crowd
up
to
okoya
he
forces
his
way
throws
his
left
arm
around
him
and
mitsha
his
right
hand
seizes
the
hand
of
the
youth
and
presses
it
against
his
breast
it
is
hayoue
who
has
come
from
the
north
at
last
his
heart
guiding
him
to
that
friend
whom
he
has
so
bravely
so
unwearyingly
sought
another
indian
rushes
down
after
hayoue
his
motions
not
less
anxious
not
less
rapid
and
determined
he
makes
his
way
to
the
body
and
falls
down
upon
his
knees
staring
with
heaving
chest
but
tearless
eyes
into
the
placid
emaciated
face
it
is
zashue
tihua
with
a
tension
akin
to
despair
he
searches
for
lingering
life
in
the
features
of
that
wife
whom
he
formerly
neglected
and
afterward
suspected
whom
he
at
last
anxiously
sought
and
now
finds
asleep
in
death
conclusion
after
long
and
it
may
be
tedious
chapters
no
apology
is
required
for
a
short
one
in
conclusion
i
can
not
take
leave
of
the
reader
however
without
having
made
in
his
company
a
brief
excursion
through
a
portion
of
new
mexico
in
the
direction
of
the
rito
de
los
frijoles
though
not
quite
so
far
we
start
from
santa
fé
that
corner
in
the
east
above
which
the
tano
village
stood
many
centuries
ago
we
proceed
to
the
rio
grande
valley
to
the
little
settlement
called
peña
blanca
and
to
the
queres
village
or
pueblo
of
cochiti
there
you
will
hear
the
language
that
was
once
spoken
on
the
rito
you
will
see
the
indians
with
characteristic
sidelocks
with
collars
of
turquoises
and
shell
beads
but
in
modern
coats
and
trousers
in
moccasins
and
in
new
england
boots
and
shoes
still
they
are
at
heart
nearly
the
same
indians
we
found
them
in
this
story
i
could
introduce
you
to
hayoue
to
zashue
to
okoya
and
the
rest
if
we
strike
the
time
well
you
may
witness
the
koshare
at
their
pranks
and
in
their
full
very
unprepossessing
ceremonial
toggery
at
cochiti
we
take
a
guide
possibly
hayoue
and
proceed
northward
in
the
direction
of
the
rito
for
a
number
of
hours
we
have
to
follow
the
base
of
the
huge
potreros
crossing
narrow
ravines
ascending
steep
but
not
long
slopes
until
at
about
noon
we
stand
on
the
brink
of
a
gorge
so
deep
that
it
may
be
termed
a
chasm
we
look
down
to
a
narrow
bottom
and
groves
of
cottonwood
trees
to
the
north
the
chasm
is
walled
in
by
towering
rocks
the
rio
grande
flows
through
one
corner
and
on
its
opposite
bank
arise
cliffs
of
trap
lava
and
basalt
black
and
threatening
while
the
rocks
on
the
west
side
are
bright
red
yellow
and
white
the
trail
to
the
rito
goes
down
into
this
abyss
and
climbs
up
on
the
other
side
through
clefts
and
along
steep
slopes
but
we
are
not
going
to
follow
this
trail
we
turn
to
the
left
and
with
the
dizzy
chasm
of
cañon
del
alamo
to
our
right
proceed
westward
on
one
of
the
narrow
tongues
which
as
the
reader
may
remember
descend
toward
the
rio
grande
from
the
high
western
mountains
and
which
are
called
in
new
mexico
potreros
the
one
on
which
we
are
travelling
or
rather
the
plateau
or
mesa
that
constitutes
its
surface
is
called
potrero
de
las
vacas
for
about
two
hours
we
wander
through
a
thin
forest
from
time
to
time
the
trail
approaches
the
brink
of
the
rocky
chasm
of
the
cañon
del
alamo
near
enough
to
have
its
echo
return
to
us
every
word
we
may
shout
down
into
its
depths
suddenly
the
timber
grows
sparse
and
we
behold
an
open
space
on
a
gentle
rise
before
us
it
is
a
bare
bleak
spot
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
mile
long
and
occupying
the
entire
width
of
the
mesa
which
here
is
not
much
broader
beyond
the
timber
begins
again
and
in
the
centre
of
the
opening
we
see
the
fairly
preserved
ruins
of
an
abandoned
indian
pueblo
illustration
a
modern
pueblo
there
are
still
in
places
three
stories
visible
the
walls
are
of
evenly
broken
parallelopipeds
of
very
friable
and
the
village
forms
the
usual
quadrangles
in
the
centre
is
a
large
square
and
no
fewer
than
six
depressions
indicate
that
the
pueblos
had
at
one
time
as
many
as
six
circular
subterranean
estufas
in
the
ruins
of
the
dwellings
over
four
hundred
cells
are
still
well
defined
so
that
the
population
of
this
communal
village
must
formerly
have
reached
as
high
as
one
thousand
souls
over
and
through
the
ruins
are
scattered
the
usual
vestiges
of
primitive
arts
and
industry
pottery
fragments
and
seldom
do
we
meet
with
a
stone
hammer
whereas
and
grinders
are
frequent
though
for
the
most
part
scattered
and
broken
the
spot
is
well
selected
for
an
abode
of
sedentary
indians
an
extensive
view
opens
toward
the
east
north
and
south
we
see
in
the
east
the
mountains
above
santa
fé
in
the
south
the
ranges
at
whose
foot
lie
the
ruins
of
hishi
in
the
north
the
high
plateaus
above
the
rito
shut
out
a
glimpse
of
the
puye
but
a
whitish
streak
in
that
direction
indicates
the
top
line
of
the
northern
cliffs
that
overhang
the
rito
de
los
frijoles
right
and
left
of
the
village
not
more
than
a
hundred
yards
from
each
side
begin
the
rugged
declivities
of
the
sides
of
the
potrero
if
we
want
to
go
farther
we
can
proceed
to
the
west
only
and
there
we
soon
get
into
timber
again
a
few
steps
within
that
timber
and
we
have
before
us
a
strange
sight
a
wall
of
rudely
piled
stone
slabs
planted
upright
flags
laid
upon
them
crosswise
and
smaller
fragments
piled
against
and
between
them
form
a
pentagonal
enclosure
which
at
first
sight
reminds
us
of
a
diminutive
stonehenge
there
is
an
entrance
to
it
from
the
southeast
an
open
corridor
flanked
by
similar
parapets
the
enclosing
wall
is
not
more
than
three
feet
high
and
we
easily
peep
into
the
interior
inside
there
are
two
statues
carved
out
of
the
living
rock
although
much
disfigured
they
still
show
a
plain
resemblance
to
the
figures
of
two
crouching
panthers
or
pumas
they
are
life
size
and
the
animals
seem
to
lie
there
with
their
heads
to
the
east
their
tails
extended
along
the
ground
as
we
stand
and
gaze
our
indian
goes
up
to
the
statues
and
furtively
anoints
their
heads
with
red
ochre
muttering
a
prayer
between
his
teeth
what
may
be
the
signification
of
this
statuary
do
you
remember
the
great
dance
at
the
rito
and
the
painting
on
the
wall
of
the
estufa
where
the
koshare
naua
sat
and
held
communication
with
those
above
do
you
recollect
that
among
these
paintings
there
was
one
of
a
panther
and
another
of
a
bear
the
relation
of
the
bear
and
panther
of
the
estufa
to
the
picture
of
the
is
here
that
of
the
two
stone
panthers
to
the
sun
himself
their
faces
are
turned
to
the
east
whence
rises
the
sun
in
which
dwells
the
father
of
all
mankind
and
the
moon
which
their
mother
inhabits
as
in
the
estufa
on
the
rito
so
in
the
outside
world
the
pictures
of
stone
express
a
prayer
to
the
higher
powers
and
here
daily
the
people
of
the
village
were
wont
to
make
offerings
and
say
their
prayers
we
are
therefore
on
sacred
ground
in
this
crumbling
enclosure
but
who
knows
that
we
are
not
on
magic
ground
also
we
might
make
an
experiment
and
though
our
indian
guide
is
not
one
of
the
great
shamans
he
might
help
us
in
an
attempt
at
innocent
jugglery
let
us
suffer
ourselves
to
be
blindfolded
and
then
turn
around
three
times
from
left
to
right
while
our
friend
recites
some
cabalistic
formula
incomprehensible
of
course
to
us
one
two
three
the
bandage
is
removed
what
can
we
see
nothing
strange
at
first
surrounding
nature
is
the
same
as
before
the
same
extensive
view
the
same
ranges
in
the
far
east
the
same
silent
frowning
rocks
the
same
dark
pines
around
us
but
in
the
north
over
the
yellowish
band
that
denotes
the
cliffs
of
the
rito
we
notice
a
slight
bluish
haze
a
change
has
taken
place
in
our
immediate
vicinity
the
stone
panthers
and
the
stone
enclosure
have
vanished
and
the
ground
is
bare
like
all
the
ground
in
the
neighbourhood
looking
beyond
we
see
that
a
transformation
has
also
taken
place
on
the
spot
where
stood
the
ruin
the
crumbling
walls
and
heaps
of
rubbish
are
gone
and
in
their
place
newly
built
foundations
are
emerging
from
the
ground
heaps
of
stone
partly
broken
are
scattered
about
and
where
a
moment
ago
we
were
the
only
living
souls
now
indians
village
indians
like
our
guide
only
somewhat
more
primitive
move
to
and
fro
busily
engaged
some
of
them
are
breaking
the
stones
into
convenient
sizes
for
the
friable
pumice
breaks
in
parallelopipeds
without
effort
the
women
are
laying
these
in
mortar
made
of
the
soil
from
the
mesa
common
adobe
we
are
witnessing
the
beginning
of
the
construction
of
a
small
village
farther
down
on
the
edge
of
the
timber
smoke
arises
there
the
builders
of
this
new
pueblo
dwell
in
huts
while
their
house
of
stone
is
growing
to
completion
it
is
the
month
of
may
and
only
the
nights
are
cool
these
builders
we
easily
recognize
they
are
the
fugitives
from
the
rito
the
little
band
whom
the
tanos
of
hishi
have
kindly
received
and
charitably
supported
until
a
few
months
since
when
they
allowed
them
to
go
and
build
a
new
home
they
came
hither
led
on
by
hayoue
who
is
now
their
maseua
for
each
tribe
however
small
must
have
one
okoya
is
with
him
and
mitsha
now
okoya
wife
comes
up
from
the
bottom
with
the
on
her
head
as
on
the
day
when
we
first
saw
her
on
the
rito
de
los
frijoles
and
now
we
have
though
in
a
trance
seen
the
further
fate
of
those
whose
sad
career
has
filled
the
pages
of
this
story
we
may
be
blindfolded
again
turned
about
right
to
left
and
when
the
bandage
is
taken
from
our
eyes
the
landscape
is
as
before
silent
and
grand
the
ruins
are
in
position
again
the
panthers
of
stone
with
their
mutilated
heads
lie
within
the
enclosure
an
eagle
soars
on
high
and
our
indian
points
to
it
smiles
and
whispers
look
see
the
shiuana
are
good
