this

from

collection

so
foreign
and
eight
more
published
by

press
in
september
isbn
released
this
story
along
with
five
others
under
the
terms
of
a
creative
commons
license
that
gives
you
the
reader
a
bunch
of
rights
that
copyright
normally
reserves
for
me
the
creator
i
recently
did
the
same
thing
with
the
entire
text
of
my
novel
down
and
out
in
the
magic
kingdom
http
and
it
was
an
unmitigated
success
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
downloaded
the
book
good
news
and
thousands
of
people
bought
the
book
also
good
news
it
turns
out
that
as
near
as
anyone
can
tell
distributing
free
electronic
versions
of
books
is
a
great
way
to
sell
more
of
the
paper
editions
while
simultaneously
getting
the
book
into
the
hands
of
readers
who
would
otherwise
not
be
exposed
to
my
work
i
still
do
know
how
it
is
artists
will
earn
a
living
in
the
age
of
the
internet
but
i
remain
convinced
that
the
way
to
find
out
is
to
do
basic
science
that
is
to
do
stuff
and
observe
the
outcome
that
what
i
doing
here
the
thing
to
remember
is
that
the
very
thing
you
can
do
to
me
as
an
artist
is
to
not
read
my
work
to
let
it
languish
in
obscurity
and
disappear
from
posterity
most
of
the
fiction
i
grew
up
on
is
and
this
is
doubly
true
for
the
short
stories
losing
a
couple
bucks
to
people
who
would
have
bought
the
book
save
for
the
availability
of
the
free
electronic
text
is
no
big
deal
at
least
when
compared
to
the
horror
that
is
being
irrelevant
and
unread
and
luckily
for
me
it
appears
that
giving
away
the
text
for
free
gets
me
more
paying
customers
than
it
loses
me

their
fathers
around
like
that
they
get
a
whipping
but
my
pa
almost
never
whipped
me
he
smiled
and
stretched
his
thick
moustache
across
his
face
james
i
know
you
love
the
store
but
it
already
been
decided
once
you
been
to
france
you
see
that
it
has
wonders
that
beat
anything
that
store
can
deliver
nothing
better
than
the
store
i
said
he
laughed
and
rumpled
my
hair
do
be
so
sure
son
there
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
then
are
dreamed
of
in
your
philosophy
it
was
one
of
his
sayings
from
shakespeare
who
he
studied
back
east
before
i
was
born
it
meant
that
the
discussion
was
closed
i
decided
to
withhold
judgement
until
i
saw
france
but
still
could
shake
the
feeling
that
my
pa
was
going
soft
in
the
head
mr
johnstone
was
fit
to
run
an
he
was
short
and
skinny
and
soft
not
like
my
pa
who
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
was
the
biggest
strongest
man
in
the
whole
world
i
loved
my
well
when
we
packed
our
bags
and
pa
went
into
the
horsebarn
to
hitch
up
our
team
i
figured
we
be
taking
a
short
trip
out
to
the
train
station
all
my
chums
were
waiting
there
to
see
us
off
and
i
promised
my
best
pal
oly
sweynsdatter
that
i
give
him
my
coonskin
cap
to
wear
until
we
came
back
but
instead
pa
rode
us
to
the
edge
of
town
where
the
road
went
to
rutted
trail
and
salt
flats
and
there
was
mr
james
h
johnstone
in
his
own
trap
pa
and
me
moved
our
luggage
into
johnstone
trap
and
got
inside
with
mama
and
hunkered
down
so
you
could
see
us
from
outside
mama
said
you
just
hush
up
now
james
there
parts
of
this
trip
that
we
could
tell
you
about
before
we
left
but
you
going
to
have
to
stay
quiet
and
hold
onto
your
questions
until
we
get
to
where
we
going
i
nearly
said
to
where
we
going
but
i
did
because
mama
had
never
looked
so
serious
in
all
my
born
days
so
i
spent
an
hour
hunkered
down
in
there
listening
to
the
clatter
of
the
wheels
and
trying
to
guess
where
we
were
going
when
i
heard
the
trap
stop
and
a
set
of
wooden
doors
close
all
my
guesses
dried
up
and
blew
away
because
i
could
think
of
anywhere
we
heard
those
sounds
out
in
the
desert
so
imagine
my
surprise
when
i
stood
up
and
found
us
right
in
our
very
own
horsebarn
having
made
a
circle
around
town
and
back
to
where
we
started
from
mama
held
a
finger
up
to
her
lips
and
then
took
mr
johnstone
soft
girlish
hand
as
he
helped
her
down
from
the
trap
my
pa
and
mr
johnstone
started
shifting
one
of
the
piles
of
that
stacked
to
the
rafters
until
they
had
revealed
a
door
that
looked
new
and
sturdy
edges
still
bright
and
yellow
and
not
the
weathered
brown
of
the
rest
of
the
barn
pa
took
a
key
ring
out
of
his
vest
pocket
and
unlocked
the
door
then
swung
it
open
each
of
us
shouldered
our
bags
and
walked
through
in
eerie
silence
into
a
pitch
black
room
pa
reached
out
and
pulled
the
door
shut
then
there
was
a
sharp
click
and
we
were
in
was
a
queer
sight
our
apartment
was
a
lozenge
of
silver
spoked
into
the
hub
of
a
floating
doughnut
pa
did
something
fancy
with
his
hands
and
the
walls
went
transparent
and
i
swear
i
dropped
to
the
floor
and
hugged
the
nubby
rubber
tiles
for
all
i
was
worth
my
eyes
were
telling
me
that
we
were
hundreds
of
yards
off
the
ground
and
while
i
jumped
from
the
rafters
of
the
horsebarn
into
the
hay
countless
times
i
suddenly
discovered
that
i
was
afraid
of
heights
after
that
first
dizzying
glimpse
of
i
kept
my
eyes
squeezed
shut
and
held
on
for
all
i
was
worth
after
a
minute
or
two
of
this
my
stomach
told
me
that
i
was
falling
and
i
could
hear
any
rushing
wind
any
birdcalls
anything
except
mama
and
pa
laughing
fit
to
bust
i
opened
one
eye
and
snuck
a
peek
my
folks
were
laughing
so
hard
they
had
to
hold
onto
each
other
to
stay
up
and
they
were
leaning
against
thin
air
pa
back
pressed
up
against
nothing
at
all
cautiously
i
got
to
my
feet
and
walked
over
to
the
edge
i
extended
one
finger
and
it
bumped
up
against
an
invisible
wall
cool
and
smooth
as
glass
in
winter
james
said
my
pa
smiling
so
wide
that
his
thick
moustache
stretched
all
the
way
across
his
face
welcome
to
pa
ambassadorial
mission
meant
that
he
often
spent
long
weeks
away
from
home
teleporting
in
only
for
sunday
dinner
the
stink
of
aliens
and
distant
worlds
clinging
to
him
even
after
he
washed
up
the
last
sunday
dinner
i
had
with
him
mama
had
made
mashed
potatoes
and
corn
bread
and
sausage
gravy
and
turkey
spending
the
whole
day
with
the
cooker
back
in
actually
it
was
by
then
but
i
always
thought
of
it
as
she
moved
the
cooker
into
the
horsebarn
after
a
week
of
wrestling
with
the
gadgets
we
had
in
our
kitchen
and
when
pa
had
warned
her
that
the
smoke
was
going
to
raise
questions
in
new
jerusalem
she
explained
that
she
was
going
to
run
some
flexible
exhaust
hose
through
the
door
into
and
into
our
apt
pa
had
shook
his
head
and
smiled
at
her
and
every
sunday
she
dragged
the
exhaust
pipe
through
the
door
that
night
pa
sat
down
and
said
grace
and
he
was
in
his
shirtsleeves
with
his
suspenders
down
and
it
almost
felt
like
home
almost
felt
like
a
million
sunday
dinners
eaten
by
gaslight
with
a
sweaty
pitcher
of
lemonade
in
the
middle
of
the
table
and
seasonal
wildflowers
and
a
stinky
cheroot
for
pa
afterwards
as
he
tipped
his
chair
back
and
rested
one
hand
on
his
belly
as
if
he
could
believe
how
much
mama
had
managed
to
stuff
him
this
time
how
are
your
studies
coming
james
he
asked
me
when
the
robutler
had
finished
clearing
the
plates
and
clattered
away
into
its
nook
very
well
sir
we
starting
calculus
now
truth
be
told
i
hated
calculus
hated
isaac
newton
and
asymptotes
and
the
whole
smelly
business
even
with
the
viral
learning
shots
it
was
like
swimming
in
molasses
for
me
calculus

was
one
of
pa
phrases
like
how

past
the
chinese
girl
from
the
ming
dynasty
the
roman
boy
and
the
injun
kid
from
south
america
pa
laughed
around
his
cigar
and
crossed
his
legs
his
shoes
were
so
big
they
looked
like
canoes
there
surely
is
son

friendly
as
all
even
the
girls
the
kids
in
even
notice
what
they
were
doing
in
school
they
just
sat
down
at
their
workstations
and
waited
to
have
their
brains
filled
with
whatever
was
going
on
and
left
at
three
and
never
complained
about
something
being
too
hard
or
too
dull
that
good
to
hear
son

always
been
a
good
boy
tell
you
what
you
bring
home
a
good
report
this
christmas
and
i
take
you
to
see
saturn
rings
on
vacation
mama
shot
him
a
look
then
but
he
pretended
he
did
see
it
he
stubbed
out
his
cigar
hitched
up
his
suspenders
and
put
on
his
tailcoat
and
tophat
and
ambassadorial
sash
and
picked
up
his
leather
case
good
night
son
good
night
ulla
i
see
you
on
wednesday
he
said
and
stepped
into
the
teleporter
that
was
the
last
time
i
ever
saw
him
he
died
from
bad
snails
oly
sweynsdatter
said
to
me
yet
again
i
balled
up
a
fist
and
stuck
it
under
his
nose
for
the
last
time
yes
ask
me
again
and
i
feed
you
this
i
been
back
for
a
month
and
in
all
that
time
oly
had
skittered
around
me
like
a
shy
pony
always
nearby
but
afraid
to
talk
to
me
finally
i
grabbed
him
and
shook
him
and
told
him
not
to
be
such
a
ninny
tell
me
what
was
on
his
mind
he
wanted
to
know
how
my
pa
had
died
over
in
france
i
told
him
the
reason
that
mama
and
mr
johnstone
and
the
man
from
the
embassy
had
worked
out
together
now
i
regretted
it
i
could
get
him
to
shut
up
sorry
all
right
sorry
he
said
taking
a
step
backwards
we
were
in
the
orchard
behind
the
schoolyard
chucking
rotten
apples
at
the
to
watch
them
splatter
want
to
hear
something
sure
i
said
tommy
benson
sweet
on
marta
helprin
it
disgusting
they
hold
hands
none
of
the
fellows
will
talk
to
him
i
did
see
what
the
big
deal
was
back
in
we
had
had
a
session
on
sexual
reproduction
like
all
the
other
subjects
most
of
the
kids
there
were
already
in
couples
sneaking
off
to
bounceataria
and
renting
private
cubes
with
untraceable
i
even
tussled
with
one
girl
katebe
another
exchange
student
from
united
africa
trading
sphere
i
picked
her
up
at
her
apt
and
her
father
had
even
shaken
my
hand
they
grow
up
fast
in
uats
of
course
i
never
let
on
to
my
folks
pa
would
broken
an
axle
that
pretty
disgusting
all
right
i
said
unconvincingly
you
want
to
go
down
to
the
river
i
told
amos
and
luke
that
i
meet
them
after
lunch
i
did
much
feel
like
it
but
i
did
know
what
else
to
do
we
walked
down
to
the
swimming
hole
where
some
boys
were
already
naked
swimming
and
horsing
around
i
found
myself
looking
away
conscious
of
their
nudity
in
a
way
that
never
been
before
all
the
boys
in
town
swam
there
all
summer
long
i
turned
my
back
to
the
group
and
stripped
down
then
ran
into
the
water
as
quick
as
i
could
i
paddled
around
a
little
and
then
i
found
myself
being
pulled
under
my
sinuses
filled
with
water
and
i
yelled
a
stream
of
bubbles
and
closed
my
mouth
on
a
swallow
of
water
strong
hands
pulled
at
my
ankles
i
kicked
out
as
hard
as
i
could
and
connected
with
someone
head
the
hands
loosened
and
i
shot
up
like
a
cork
sputtering
and
coughing
i
ran
for
the
shore
and
saw
one
of
the
allen
brothers
surfacing
rubbing
at
his
head
and
laughing
the
four
allen
boys
lived
on
a
ranch
with
their
parents
out
by
the
salt
flats
and
we
only
saw
them
when
they
came
into
town
with
their
folks
for
supplies
i
never
liked
them
but
now
i
saw
red
you
pig
i
shouted
at
him
you
stupid
rotten
pig
what
the
heck
do
you
think
you
were
doing
the
allens
kept
on
laughing
i
used
to
know
some
of
their
names
but
in
the
time
i
been
in
they
grown
as
indistinguishable
as
twins
big
hard
boys
with
their
heads
shaved
for
lice
they
pointed
at
me
and
laughed
i
scooped
up
a
flat
stone
from
the
shore
and
threw
it
at
the
head
of
the
one
who
pulled
me
under
as
hard
as
i
could
lucky
for
him
and
me
i
was
too
angry
to
aim
properly
and
the
stone
hit
him
in
the
shoulder
knocking
him
backwards
he
shouted
at
me
it
was
like
a
roar
of
a
wild
animal
and
the
four
brothers
charged
oly
appeared
at
my
side
run
he
shouted
i
was
too
angry
i
balled
my
fists
and
stood
my
ground
the
first
one
shot
out
of
the
water
towards
me
and
punched
me
so
hard
in
the
guts
i
saw
stars
i
fell
to
the
ground
gasping
i
looked
up
at
a
forest
of
strong
bare
legs
and
knew
they
surrounded
me
it
the
sheriff
oly
shouted
the
legs
disappeared
i
struggled
to
my
knees
oly
collapsed
to
the
ground
beside
me
laughing
did
you
see
the
way
they
ran
the
sheriff
never
comes
down
to
the
river
thanks
i
said
around
gasps
and
started
to
get
dressed
any
time
he
said
now
let
do
some
swimming
no
i
got
ta
go
home
and
help
mama
i
lied
i
did
feel
like
going
skinny
dipping
anymore
maybe
never
again
oly
gave
me
a
queer
look
see
you
i
went
straight
home
pelting
down
the
road
as
fast
as
i
could
not
even
looking
where
i
was
going
i
let
the
door
slam
behind
me
and
took
the
stairs
two
at
a
time
up
to
the
attic
ladder
then
bolted
the
shut
behind
me
and
sat
in
the
dark
with
my
knees
in
my
chest
down
below
mama
let
out
a
james
is
that
you
like
she
always
did
since
i
came
back
home
i
ignored
her
like
always
and
she
stopped
worrying
about
it
like
always
pa
last
trip
had
been
to
the
dalai
lama
court
in
the
man
from
the
embassy
said
that
he
was
going
to
talk
with
the
monks
about
a
that
the
two
embassies
were
jointly
presenting
on
the
effect
of
mimetic
ambassadorships
on
the
reincarnated
soul
it
was
all
nonsense
to
me
he
never
arrived
the
teleporter
said
that
it
had
put
him
down
gentle
as
you
like
on
the
floor
of
the
lama
floating
castle
over
the
caspian
sea
but
the
monks
never
saw
him
and
that
was
that
it
had
been
a
month
since
our
return
i
ventured
out
into
town
and
looked
up
my
chums
and
found
them
so
full
of
gossip
that
did
mean
anything
to
me
so
absorbed
with
games
that
seemed
childish
to
me
so
strange
that
i
retreated
home
i
prowled
around
our
house
like
a
burglar
at
first
and
when
i
came
back
to
the
attic
all
the
numbness
that
had
enveloped
me
since
the
man
from
the
state
department
had
teleported
into
our
apt
melted
away
and
i
started
bawling
the
attic
had
always
been
pa
domain
he
come
up
here
with
whatever
crackpot
invention
he
ordered
this
month
out
of
a
catalog
or
one
of
the
expensive
foreign
journals
he
subscribed
to
and
tinker
and
swear
and
hit
his
thumbnail
and
tear
his
pants
on
a
stray
dingus
and
smoke
his
cheroots
and
have
a
heck
of
a
time
the
muffled
tread
of
his
feet
and
the
distant
cursing
while
i
sat
in
the
parlour
downstairs
had
been
the
homiest
sound
i
knew
mama
and
i
would
lock
eyes
every
time
a
particularly
forceful
round
of
hollers
shook
down
and
mama
would
get
a
little
smile
and
her
eyes
would
crinkle
and
i
felt
like
we
were
sharing
a
secret
now
the
attic
was
my
private
domain
there
was
the
elixir
shelf
full
of
patent
medicines
and
soothing
syrups
there
was
the
bookcase
full
of
wild
theories
and
fantastic
adventure
stories
there
were
the
crates
full
of
dangerous
machines
an
automatic
a
and
other
devices
whose
nature
i
could
even
guess
at
none
of
them
had
ever
worked
but
i
liked
to
run
my
hands
over
them
feel
the
smooth
steel
of
their
parts
disassemble
and
reassemble
them
back
in
i
once
tried
to
take
the
robutler
apart
just
to
get
a
look
at
how
it
was
all
put
together
but
it
was
a
lost
cause
i
could
even
figure
out
how
to
get
the
cover
off
i
walked
through
the
cool
dark
the
only
light
coming
from
the
grimy
attic
window
and
fondled
each
piece
i
picked
up
an
oilcan
and
started
oiling
the
joints
and
bearings
and
axles
of
each
machine
in
turn
pa
would
have
wanted
to
know
that
everything
was
in
good
working
order
i
think
you
should
be
going
to
school
james
mama

at
breakfast

morning
chores

in
the
coal

care
of
the
and
making
my
bed
i
took
another
forkful
of
sausage
and
a
spoonful
of
mush
chewed
and
looked
at
my
plate
it
time
it
time
you
ca
spend
the
rest
of
your
life
sulking
around
here
your
father
would
have
wanted
us
to
get
on
with
our
lives
even
though
i
was
looking
at
her
when
she
said
this
i
knew
that
her
eyes
were
bright
with
tears
the
way
they
always
got
when
she
mentioned
his
chair
sat
empty
at
the
head
of
the
table
i
had
another
bite
of
sausage
james
arthur
nicholson
look
at
me
when
i
speak
to
you
i
looked
up
reflexively
as
i
always
did
when
she
used
my
full
name
my
eyes
slid
over
her
face
then
focused
on
a
point
over
her
left
shoulder
yes
you
going
to
school
today
and
i
expect
to
get
a
good
report
from
mr
adelson
yes
we
have
two
schools
in
new
jerusalem
the
elementary
school
that
was
built
twenty
years
before
when
they
put
in
the
wooden
sidewalks
and
the
town
hall
and
the
academy
that
was
built
just
before
i
left
for
miss
tannenbaum
a
spinster
lady
with
a
moustache
and
a
bristling
german
accent
terrorised
the
little
kids
in
the
elementary
school
i
been
stuck
in
her
class
for
five
long
years
mr
adelson
who
was
raised
in
san
francisco
and
who
had
worked
as
a
roustabout
a
telegraph
operator
and
a
merchant
seaman
taught
the
academy
and
his
wild
stories
were
all
oly
could
talk
about
he
raised
one
eyebrow
quizzically
when
i
came
through
the
door
at
that
morning
he
was
tall
like
my
pa
but
pa
had
been
as
big
as
an
ox
and
mr
adelson
was
thin
and
wiry
he
wore
rumpled
pants
and
a
shirt
with
a
wilted
celluloid
collar
he
had
a
skinny
little
beard
that
made
him
look
like
a
gentleman
pirate
and
used
some
shiny
pomade
to
grease
his
hair
straight
back
from
his
high
forehead
i
caught
him
reading
thumbing
the
pages
of
a
leatherbound
volume
mr
adelson
why
james
nicholson
what
can
i
do
for
you
sonny
new
jerusalem
only
had
but
citizens
and
only
a
hundred
or
so
in
town
proper
so
of
course
he
knew
who
i
was
but
it
surprised
me
to
hear
him
pronounce
my
name
in
his
creaky
weatherbeaten
voice
my
mother
says
i
have
to
go
to
the
academy
she
does
hey
how
do
you
feel
about
that
i
snuck
a
look
at
his
face
to
see
if
he
was
putting
me
on
but
i
could
tell
he
raised
up
his
other
eyebrow
now
and
was
looking
hard
at
me
there
might
have
been
the
beginning
of
a
smile
on
his
face
but
it
was
hard
to
tell
with
the
beard
i
guess
it
do
matter
how
i
feel
oh
i
do
know
about
that
this
is
a
school
not
a
prison
after
all
how
old
are
you
fourteen
sir
that
would
put
you
in
with
the
seniors
do
you
think
you
can
handle
their
course
of
study
it
through
the
semester
now
and
i
do
know
how
much
they
taught
you
when
you
were
over
in
he
swallowed
france
i
did
know
what
to
say
to
that
so
i
just
stared
at
my
hard
uncomfortable
shoes
how
are
your
maths
have
you
studied
geometry
basic
algebra
yes
sir
they
taught
us
all
that
and
lots
more
besides
i
had
the
feeling
of
icebergs
of
knowledge
floating
in
my
brain
ready
to
crest
the
waves
and
crash
against
the
walls
of
my
skull
very
good
we
will
be
studying
maths
today
in
the
seniors
class
we
see
how
you
do
is
that
all
right
again
i
did
know
if
he
was
really
asking
so
i
just
said
yes
sir
marvelous
we
see
you
at
the
bell
then
and
james
he
paused
waited
until
i
met
his
gaze
his
eyebrows
were
at
rest
i
sorry
about
your
father
i
met
him
several
times
he
was
a
good
man
thank
you
sir
i
said
unable
to
look
away
from
his
stare
the
first
half
of
the
day
passed
with
incredible
sloth
as
i
copied
down
problems
to
my
slate
and
pretended
to
puzzle
over
them
before
writing
down
the
answer
i
known
the
minute
i
saw
the
question
at
lunch
i
found
a
seat
at
the
base
of
the
big
willow
out
front
of
the
school
and
unwrapped
the
waxed
paper
from
the
thick
ham
sandwich
mama
had
fixed
me
i
munched
it
and
conjugated
latin
verbs
in
my
head
trying
to
make
the
day
pass
oly
and
the
fellows
were
roughhousing
in
the
yard
playing
with
amos
gundersen
out
front
showing
off
by
walking
on
his
hands
and
then
springing
upright
amos
mother
came
from
circus
people
in
russia
and
all
the
kids
in
his
family
wanted
to
be
acrobats
when
they
grew
up
i
tried
not
to
watch
them
i
was
engrossed
in
a
caterpillar
that
was
crawling
up
my
when
mr
adelson
cleared
his
throat
behind
me
i
started
and
the
caterpillar
tumbled
to
the
ground
and
then
mr
adelson
was
squatting
on
his
long
haunches
at
my
side
how
are
you
liking
your
first
day
james
he
asked
in
his
raspy
voice
it
fine
sir
and
the
work
you
able
to
keep
up
with
the
class
it
not
a
problem
for
me
we
studied
this
when
i
was
away
are
you
bored
do
you
need
more
of
a
challenge
it
fine
sir
you
want
to
assign
me
some
factoring
right
then
do
hesitate
to
call
on
me
if
things
are
moving
too
slowly
or
too
quickly
i
mean
that
i
snuck
another
look
at
him
he
seemed
sincere
why
are
you
playing
with
your
chums
i
do
feel
like
it
you
just
wanted
to
think
i
guess
so
why
would
he
just
leave
me
alone
it
hard
to
come
home
is
it
i
stared
at
my
shoes
what
did
he
know
about
it
i
been
around
the
world
you
know
that
i
sailed
with
a
tramp
steamer
the
i
saw
the
naked
savages
of
polynesia
and
the
voodoo
witches
that
the
freed
slaves
of
the
caribbean
worship
and
the
coolies
pulling
rickshaws
in
peking
it
was
so
to
come
home
to
frisco
after
five
years
at
sea
to
my
surprise
he
sat
down
next
to
me
in
the
dirt
and
roots
at
the
base
of
the
tree
you
know
aboard
the
they
called
me
runnyguts
i
threw
up
every
hour
for
my
first
month
i
was
more
reliable
than
the
watch
but
they
did
mean
anything
by
it
when
you
live
with
a
crew
for
years
you
become
a
different
person
we
be
out
at
sea
nothing
but
water
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
and
we
be
playing
cards
we
told
each
other
every
joke
we
knew
already
and
every
story
about
home
and
we
knew
that
deck
of
cards
so
well
which
one
had
stains
on
the
back
and
which
one
turned
up
at
corner
and
which
one
had
been
torn
and
we
just
scream
at
the
sun
so
bored
but
then
we
put
in
to
port
at
some
foreign
city
and
we
come
down
the
plank
in
our
best
clothes
twenty
men
who
knew
each
other
better
than
brothers
hard
and
brown
from
months
at
sea
and
it
felt
like
whatever
happened
in
that
strange
we
come
out
on
top
and
then
i
came
back
to
the
frisco
and
the
captain
shook
my
hand
and
gave
me
a
sack
of
gold
and
saw
me
off
and
i
never
felt
so
alone
and
i
never
seen
a
place
so
foreign
i
went
back
to
my
old
haunts
the
saloons
where
i
gone
for
a
beer
after
a
day
work
at
the
docks
and
the
and
the
theatres
and
i
saw
my
old
chums
that
was
hard
james
he
stopped
then
i
found
myself
saying
how
was
it
hard
mr
adelson
he
looked
surprised
like
he
forgotten
that
he
was
talking
to
me
well
james
it
like
this
when
you
away
that
long
you
get
to
invent
yourself
all
over
again
of
course
everyone
invents
themselves
as
they
grow
up
your
chums
there
he
gestured
at
the
boys
who
were
now
trying
with
varying
success
to
turn
somersaults
dirtying
their
school
clothes
inventing
themselves
right
now
whether
they
know
it
or
not
the
smart
one
the
strong
one
the
brave
one
the
sad
one
it
going
on
while
we
watch
but
when
you
go
away
nobody
knows
you
and
you
can
be
whoever
you
want
you
can
shed
your
old
skin
and
grow
a
new
one
when
we
put
out
to
sea
i
was
just
a
youngster
eighteen
years
old
and
fresh
from
my
pa
house
he
was
a
cablecar
engineer
and
wanted
me
to
follow
in
his
shoes
get
an
apprenticeship
and
join
him
there
under
the
hills
oiling
the
giant
pulleys
but
no
not
me
i
wanted
to
put
out
to
sea
and
see
the
world
i
never
been
out
of
the
city
can
you
believe
that
the
first
port
where
i
took
shore
leave
was
in
haiti
and
when
i
stepped
onto
the
dock
it
was
like
my
life
was
starting
all
over
again
i
got
a
tattoo
and
i
drank
hard
liquor
and
gambled
in
the
saloons
and
did
all
the
things
that
a
man
did
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
he
had
a
faraway
look
now
staring
at
the
boys
game
without
seeing
it
and
when
i
got
back
sick
and
tired
and
broke
there
was
a
new
kid
there
a
negro
from
who
signed
on
to
be
a
cabin
boy
his
name
was
and
he
did
speak
a
word
of
english
and
i
did
speak
a
word
of
french
but
i
took
him
under
my
wing
james
and
acted
like
i
been
at
sea
all
my
life
and
showed
him
the
ropes
and
taught
him
to
play
cards
and
bossed
him
around
and
taught
him
english
one
word
at
a
time
and
that
became
the
new
me
every
time
a
new
hand
signed
on
i
would
be
his
teacher
his
mentor
his
guide
and
then
i
came
home
as
far
as
the
folks
back
home
were
concerned
i
was
the
kid
they
said
to
five
years
before
my
father
thought
i
was
still
a
kid
even
though
i
fought
pirates
and
weathered
storms
my
chums
wanted
me
to
be
the
kid
been
and
do
all
the
boring
kid
things
we
done
before
i
left
riding
the
trolleys
watching
the
vaudeville
shows
fishing
off
the
docks
even
though
that
stuff
was
still
fun
it
was
not
anymore
i
missed
the
old
me
and
felt
him
slipping
away
so
you
know
what
i
did
you
moved
to
new
jerusalem
i
moved
to
new
jerusalem
well
to
salt
lake
city
first
i
studied
with
the
jesuits
to
be
a
teacher
then
i
saw
an
ad
for
a
teacher
in
the
paper
and
i
packed
my
bag
and
caught
the
next
train
and
here
i
am
not
the
me
that
came
home
from
sea
and
not
the
me
who
i
was
before
i
went
to
sea
but
someone
in
between
a
new
me
teaching
but
on
dry
land
and
not
chasing
dangerous
adventures
but
still
reading
my
old
and
smiling
we
sat
for
a
moment
in
companionable
silence
then
abruptly
he
checked
his
pocket
watch
and
yelped
damn
lunch
was
over
twenty
minutes
ago
he
leapt
to
his
feet
as
smoothly
as
a
boy
and
ran
into
the
schoolhouse
to
ring
the
bell
i
folded
up
the
and
thought
about
this
adult
who
talked
to
me
like
an
adult
who
did
worry
about
swearing
or
telling
me
about
his
adventures
and
i
made
my
way
back
to
class
it
went
better
the
rest
of
that
day
in
pa
had
almost
never
been
home
but
his
presence
was
always
around
us
i
call
the
robutler
out
of
its
closet
and
have
it
affix
its
electrode
fingertips
to
my
temples
and
juice
my
endorphins
after
a
hard
day
at
school
and
when
i
was
done
the
faint
smell
of
pa
picked
up
from
the
and
impossible
to
be
rid
of
would
cling
to
me
or
i
sit
down
on
the
oubliette
and
find
one
of
pa
journals
from
back
home
and
open
to
an
article
on
mental
telepathy
we
did
esp
in
school
and
it
was
all
about
a
race
of
alien
traders
who
communicated
in
geometric
thought
pictures
that
took
forever
to
translate
we
never
learned
about
magnetism
and
astral
projection
and
all
the
other
things
pa
journals
were
full
of
and
while
i
never
doubted
the
things
in
pa
journals
i
never
brought
them
up
in
class
neither
there
were
lots
of
different
kinds
of
truth
james
yes
mama
i
said
on
my
way
out
to
chop
kindling
did
you
finish
your
homework
yes
mama
good
boy
homework
had
been
some
math
and
some
biology
and
some
geology
i
done
it
before
i
left
school
the
report
cards
came
out
in
the
middle
of
december
mr
adelson
sealed
them
with
wax
in
thick
brown
envelopes
and
handed
them
out
at
the
end
of
the
day
sealing
them
was
a
dirty
trick
it
mean
a
boy
would
have
to
go
home
not
knowing
whether
to
expect
a
whipping
or
an
extra
slice
of
pie
and
the
fellows
were
as
nervous
as
cats
in
a
factory
when
class
let
out
for
once
there
was
no
horseplay
afterwards
i
came
home
and
tossed
the
envelope
on
the
kitchen
table
without
a
worry
i
aced
every
test
i
done
every
assignment
i
led
the
class
in
a
bored
sleepy
way
regurgitating
the
things
they
stuck
in
my
brain
in
i
went
up
to
the
attic
and
started
reading
one
of
pa
adventure
stories
of
the
by
the
frenchman
jules
verne
pa
had
all
of
books
each
of
them
crisply
autographed
on
the
inside
cover
he
met
verne
on
one
of
his
diplomatic
missions
and
the
two
had
been
like
two
peas
in
a
pod
to
hear
him
tell
of
it
they
both
subscribed
to
all
the
same
crazy
journals
i
was
reading
my
favorite
part
where
tarzan
meets
the
man
in
the
balloon
when
mama
voice
called
from
downstairs
james
arthur
nicholson
get
your
behind
down
here
i
jumped
like
i
was
stung
and
rattled
down
the
attic
stairs
so
fast
i
nearly
broke
my
neck
and
then
down
into
the
parlour
where
mama
was
holding
my
report
card
and
looking
fit
to
bust
yes
mama
i
said
what
is
it
she
handed
me
the
report
card
and
folded
her
arms
over
her
chest
explain
that
mister
make
it
good
i
read
the
card
and
my
eyes
nearly
jumped
out
of
my
head
the
rotten
had
given
me
f
all
the
way
down
in
every
subject
below
in
his
hand
he
written
james
performance
this
semester
has
disappointed
me
gravely
i
would
like
it
very
much
if
i
could
meet
with
you
and
he
mrs
nicholson
at
your
earliest
convenience
to
discuss
his
future
at
the
academy
signed
rbt
adelson
mama
grabbed
my
ear
and
twisted
i
howled
and
dropped
the
card
before
i
knew
what
was
happening
she
had
me
over
her
knee
and
was
paddling
my
bottom
with
her
open
hand
hard

think

james

your
whack

an
inch
of
your
life
and
she
gave
me
a
load
more
whacks
i
was
too
stunned
even
to
cry
or
howl
pa
had
only
beat
me
twice
in
all
the
time
i
known
him
mama
had
beat
me
my
bottom
ached
distantly
and
i
felt
tears
come
to
my
eyes
well
what
do
you
have
to
say
for
yourself
mama
it
a
mistake
i
began
you
durn
right
she
said
no
really
i
did
all
my
homework
i
passed
all
the
exams
i
showed
to
you
you
saw
the
unfairness
of
it
made
my
heart
hammer
in
time
to
the
throbbing
of
my
backside
mama
breath
fumed
angrily
out
of
her
nose
you
go
straight
to
your
room
and
we
going
to
see
mr
adelson
first
thing
tomorrow
morning
what
about
my
chores
i
said
oh
do
worry
about
that
you
have
of
chores
to
do
when
i
let
you
out
i
went
to
my
room
and
stripped
down
and
lay
on
my
tummy
and
cracked
my
window
so
the
icy
winter
air
blew
over
my
backside
i
cried
a
vale
of
tears
and
rained
down
miserable
mean
curses
on
everyone
mama
pa
and
especially
the
lying
snaky
backstabbing
runnyguts
adelson
mama
did
get
any
less
mad
through
the
night
but
when
she
came
to
my
door
at
she
seemed
to
be
holding
it
in
better
my
throat
and
eyes
were
sore
as
sandpaper
from
crying
and
mama
gave
me
exactly
five
minutes
to
wash
up
and
dress
before
dragging
me
out
to
the
horsebarn
she
already
hitched
up
our
team
and
refused
my
hand
when
i
tried
to
help
her
up
i
been
angry
and
righteous
when
i
woke
but
seeing
mama
towering
barely
controlled
fury
changed
my
mood
to
dire
terror
i
stared
out
at
the
trees
and
farms
as
we
rode
into
town
feeling
like
a
condemned
man
being
taken
to
the
gallows
mama
pulled
up
out
front
of
the
academy
and
marched
me
around
back
to
the
teacher
cottage
she
rapped
on
the
door
and
waited
blowing
clouds
of
steam
out
of
her
nose
into
the
frosty
morning
air
mr
adelson
answered
the
door
in
shirtsleeves
and
suspenders
unshaved
and
bleary
his
hair
normally
neatly
oiled
and
slicked
stuck
out
like
frayed
the
muscles
on
his
thin
arms
stood
out
like
snakes
he
blinked
at
us
standing
on
his
doorstep
mrs
nicholson
he
said
mr
adelson
my
mother
said
we
come
to
discuss
james
report
card
mr
adelson
smoothed
his
hair
back
and
stepped
aside
please
come
in
can
i
offer
you
some
coffee
no
thank
you
mama
said
primly
standing
in
his
foyer
he
held
out
his
hand
for
her
coat
and
kerchief
and
she
handed
them
to
him
i
took
off
my
coat
and
struggled
out
of
my
boots
he
took
them
both
and
put
them
away
in
a
closet
i
going
to
have
some
coffee
are
you
sure
i
ca
offer
you
a
cup
no
thank
you
all
the
same
as
you
wish
he
disappeared
down
the
dark
hallway
and
mama
and
i
found
our
way
into
his
tiny
parlour
books
were
stacked
every
which
where
dusty
and
precarious
mama
and
i
sat
down
in
a
pair
of
cushioned
chairs
and
mr
adelson
came
in
holding
two
mugs
of
coffee
he
set
one
down
next
to
mama
on
the
floor
then
smacked
himself
in
the
forehead
you
said
no
did
you
sorry
i
not
quite
awake
yet
well
leave
it
there
there
cream
in
it
maybe
the
cat
will
have
some
he
settled
himself
onto
another
chair
and
sipped
at
his
coffee
let
start
over
shall
we
hello
mrs
nicholson
hello
james
i
understand
you
here
to
discuss
james
report
card
mama
sat
back
a
little
in
her
chair
and
let
hint
of
a
sardonic
smile
show
on
her
face
yes
we
are
forgive
my
coming
by
unannounced
oh
it
nothing
mr
adelson
drank
more
coffee
mama
smoothed
her
skirts
i
kicked
my
feet
against
the
rungs
of
my
chair
finally
it
was
too
much
for
me
what
the
big
idea
anyway
i
said
glaring
daggers
at
him
i
do
deserve
no
f
any
f
mr
adelson
corrected
why
do
you
think
so
well
because
i
did
all
my
homework
i
gave
the
right
answers
in
class
i
passed
all
the
tests
it
ai
fair
not
fair
my
mama
corrected
gently
she
was
staring
distractedly
at
mr
adelson
what
you
say
is
true
enough
james
what
grade
do
you
suppose
you
gotten
why
an
a
an
perfect
i
said
glaring
again
at
him
daring
him
to
say
otherwise
is
that
what
an
is
for
james
perfection
sure
i
said
opening
my
mouth
without
thinking
mama
shifted
her
stare
to
me
she
was
looking
even
more
thoughtful
why
do
you
suppose
you
go
to
school
mama
says
i
have
to
i
said
sullenly
james
mama
said
oh
i
suppose
it
to
learn
things
i
said
mr
adelson
smiled
and
nodded
the
way
he
did
when
one
of
the
students
got
the
right
answer
in
class
well
well
what
i
said
what
did
you
learn
this
semester
why
everything
you
taught
geometry
algebra
latin
geography
biology
physics
grammar
i
see
he
said
james
what
the
formula
for
determining
the
constant
in
the
second
derivative
of
an
equation
i
knew
that
one
it
was
one
of
newton
dirty
calculus
proofs
it
a
trick
question
there
no
way
to
get
the
constant
of
second
derivative
exactly
right
he
said
yes
i
said
and
folded
my
arms
across
my
chest
where
did
you
learn
that
in
i
started
to
say
but
caught
myself
in
france
yes
yes
i
said
the
fingers
of
dawn
crept
across
my
comprehension
oh
mama
smiled
at
me
but
it
not
fair
so
what
if
i
already
knew
everything
before
i
started
i
still
did
all
the
work
why
are
you
in
school
james
mr
nicholson
asked
me
again
to
learn
well
then
i
think
you
better
start
learning
something
do
you
you
the
brightest
student
in
the
class
you
certainly
smarter
than
i
am
i
just
an
old
sailor
struggling
along
with
the
rest
of
the
class
but
you
you
you
been
marking
time
in
class
all
semester
and
i
daresay
you
learned
a
single
thing
since
you
started
that
why
you
got
f
mr
adelson
mama
said
am
i
to
understand
that
james
performed
all
his
assignments
satisfactorily
it
was
mr
adelson
turn
to
squirm
yes
but
madam
you
have
to
understand
mama
waved
aside
his
objections
if
james
satisfactorily
completed
all
the
work
assigned
to
him
then
i
think
he
should
have
a
grade
that
reflects
that
you
she
took
a
sip
of
her
coffee
yes
well
however
you
do
have
a
point
i
did
send
my
son
to
your
school
so
that
he
could
mark
time
as
you
put
it
i
sent
him
there
to
learn
to
be
have
you
taught
him
anything
mr
adelson
mr
adelson
looked
so
sad
i
forgave
him
the
report
card
and
spoke
up
yes
mama
mama
swiveled
her
head
to
me
really
yes
he
taught
me
what
i
was
at
school
for
just
now
i
see
mama
said
this
is
very
good
coffee
mr
adelson
thank
you
he
said
and
sipped
at
his
james
mr
adelson
said
you
learned
your
first
lesson
what
do
you
propose
your
second
should
be
i
dunno
i
said
and
went
back
to
kicking
the
rungs
of
the
chair
what
is
it
that
you
have
been
doing
since
you
came
back
to
town
son
he
asked
hanging
around
in
the
attic
mostly
reading
tinkering
like
my
my
husband
machines
and
journals
are
up
there
mama
explained
and
his
books
i
said
books
mr
adelson
looked
suddenly
interested
what
kind
of
books
adventure
stories
stevenson
wells
some
of
it
in
french
we
have
all
of
verne
well
perhaps
that
can
be
your
next
assignment
i
would
like
to
see
an
original
composition
of
no
less
than
twenty
pages
discussing
each
work
of
verne
charting
his
literary
progress
due
january
fifth
please
twenty
pages
i
said
but
it
the
holidays
very
well
whatever
length
the
piece
turns
out
is
fine
but
be
sure
you
do
justice
to
each
work
by
the
time
i
got
through
with
the
assignment
it
was
pages
long
i
never
thought
i
could
write
that
much
but
it
kept
on
coming
new
thoughts
about
each
book
each
scene
the
different
worlds
verne
had
built
the
fantastic
slopes
of
barsoom
the
sinister
island
of
dr
moreau
each
one
spawned
a
new
insight
i
felt
like
the
verne
detective
sherlock
holmes
assembling
all
of
the
seemingly
insignificant
details
into
some
kind
of
coherent
picture
finding
the
improbable
links
between
the
wildly
different
stories
the
frenchman
told
mama
was
thrilled
to
see
me
working
papers
spread
out
all
around
me
on
the
kitchen
table
i
could
used
pa
study
but
it
felt
like
an
invasion
somehow
writing
until
my
wrists
cramped
she
let
me
get
away
without
doing
my
chores
rising
early
to
milk
the
cow
bringing
in
the
eggs
from
the
henhouse
even
chopping
the
kindling
just
so
long
as
i
was
writing
she
was
happy
to
let
me
go
on
shirking
my
responsibilities
even
on
christmas
eve
i
was
too
distracted
to
really
enjoy
the
smells
of
goose
and
ham
and
the
stuffing
mama
spent
days
preparing
i
was
still
writing
when
she
told
me
to
go
change
and
set
the
table
for
three
we
having
mr
johnston
to
dinner
she
said
i
made
a
face
mr
johnston
was
the
only
one
in
town
that
i
could
have
talked
to
about
my
time
in
but
i
never
did
he
had
a
way
of
bossing
a
fellow
around
while
seeming
to
be
nice
to
him
he
still
ran
pa
store
using
ladders
to
reach
the
high
shelves
that
pa
had
just
plucked
things
off
of
i
had
to
see
him
when
mama
sent
me
on
errands
there
but
i
made
sure
that
i
left
as
quickly
as
i
could
mama
kept
saying
that
i
should
ask
him
for
a
job
but
i
was
pretty
good
at
changing
the
subject
whenever
it
came
up
i
put
away
my
papers
and
changed
into
my
sunday
clothes
i
been
hinting
to
mama
lately
that
a
boy
just
was
complete
without
a
puppy
so
i
put
an
extra
shine
on
my
shoes
and
said
a
quick
prayer
that
i
would
find
socks
and
under
the
tree
mr
johnstone
arrived
with
a
of
gifts
well
he
run
my
store
after
all
so
he
could
get
things
wholesale
i
took
his
parcels
from
him
and
set
them
under
the
tree
then
that
dandified
sissy
actually
my
mama
on
the
cheek
lifting
a
sprig
of
mistletoe
up
with
one
hand
when
pa
and
mama
stood
together
she
barely
come
up
to
his
shoulder
while
mr
johnstone
had
to
stand
on
tiptoe
to
get
the
mistletoe
over
their
heads
merry
christmas
ulla
he
said
she
took
his
hands
and
said
merry
christmas
james
i
wanted
to
be
sick
mr
johnstone
had
a
whiskey
in
our
parlour
before
we
ate
sitting
in
my
chair
smoking
a
cigar
from
my
pa
humidor
mama
ordered
me
to
keep
him
company
while
she
set
out
the
meal
do
they
call
you
jimmy
he
asked
me
staring
down
his
long
pointy
nose
no
sir
james
it
a
fine
name
is
it
served
me
well
man
and
boy
he
made
a
face
that
was
supposed
to
be
funny
like
he
bit
into
a
lemon
i
like
it
fine
sir
are
you
having
any
problems
adjusting
now
that
you
home
finding
it
hard
to
relate
to
the
other
fellows
no
sir
you
do
find
it
strange
after
seeing
no
sir
it
home
ha
he
said
as
though
i
said
something
profound
i
guess
it
is
at
that
say
why
do
you
come
by
the
store
some
time
i
just
got
some
samples
from
a
new
candy
company
in
oregon
and
i
need
to
get
an
unbiased
opinion
before
i
order
he
gave
me
a
pinched
smile
like
he
thought
he
was
santa
claus
mama
does
like
me
eating
sweets
i
said
and
stared
at
my
reflection
in
my
shoes
mama
rescued
me
by
coming
into
the
parlour
then
looking
young
and
pretty
in
her
best
dress
dinner
is
served
gentlemen
we
followed
her
into
the
dining
room
and
mr
johnstone
took
my
pa
seat
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
carved
the
goose
even
though
the
bird
was
brown
and
juicy
i
found
i
did
have
any
appetite
i
have
word
from
pondicherry
mr
johnstone
said
as
he
poured
gravy
over
his
second
helping
of
mashed
potatoes
yes
mama
said
who
he
i
asked
your
father
successor
mr
johnstone
said
a
british
officer
from
new
delhi
a
fat
little
man
and
awfully
full
of
himself
i
repressed
a
snort
for
my
money
mr
johnstone
was
as
full
of
himself
as
one
man
could
be
i
could
imagine
a
blacker
kettle
he
says
that
nussbaum
from
new
york
has
rolled
back
relations
with
extraterrestrials
by
fifty
years
he
sold
a
centurian
half
a
million
defective
umbrellas
from
his
factory
the
new
yorkers
are
all
defending
him
i
never
could
keep
track
of
who
was
friendly
and
who
was
mama
said
it
was
all
greek
to
me
politics
mr
johnstone
opened
his
mouth
to
explain
but
mama
held
up
one
hand
no
no
i
do
to
understand
les
used
to
lecture
me
about
this
from
dawn
to
dusk
she
smiled
a
little
sad
smile
and
stared
off
at
the
on
our
walls
mr
johnstone
put
one
hand
over
hers
he
was
a
good
man
ulla
mama
stood
and
smoothed
her
skirts
i
get
dessert
i
did
get
a
puppy
mr
johnstone
gave
me
an
that
i
was
sure
mama
would
have
fits
over
but
she
just
smiled
she
gave
me
a
beautiful
and
a
green
blotter
and
a
ream
of
creamy
thick
paper
the
pen
made
the
most
beautiful
marks
and
the
paper
drank
it
up
like
a
thirsty
man
in
the
desert
i
recopied
my
essay
the
next
day
sitting
with
mama
in
the
parlour
while
she
darned
socks
mr
johnstone
had
given
her
a
tin
of
cosmetics
from
paris
that
he
ordered
in
special
i
heard
mama
say
that
only
dancehall
girls
wore
makeup
but
she
blushed
when
he
gave
it
to
her
i
gave
her
a
carving
i
done
of
the
robutler
we
had
in
i
whittled
it
out
of
a
block
of
pine
and
sanded
it
and
oiled
it
until
it
was
as
smooth
as
silk
oly
sweynsdatter
came
by
after
supper
and
asked
if
i
wanted
to
go
out
and
play
with
the
fellows
to
my
surprise
i
found
i
did
we
had
a
grand
afternoon
pelting
each
other
with
a
game
that
turned
into
a
war
as
all
the
older
boys
back
from
came
out
and
joined
in
and
then
later
all
the
men
even
the
sheriff
and
mr
adelson
i
never
laughed
so
much
in
all
my
life
even
when
i
got
one
right
in
the
ear
mr
adelson
led
a
charge
of
adults
against
the
fort
that
most
of
the
academy
boys
were
hiding
behind
but
i
saw
him
planning
it
and
started
laying
in
ammunition
long
before
they
made
their
go
and
we
sent
them
back
with
their
tails
between
their
legs
i
hit
him
smack
in
the
behind
with
one
ball
as
he
dove
for
cover
oly
mother
gave
us
both
good
svenska
hot
cocoa
afterwards
with
fresh
whipped
cream
and
oly
and
i
exchanged
gifts
he
gave
me
a
tin
soldier
a
confederate
who
was
caught
in
the
act
of
falling
over
backwards
clutching
his
chest
i
gave
him
my
best
marble
we
followed
his
mother
around
their
house
recounting
the
adventures
in
the
snow
until
she
told
me
it
was
time
for
me
to
go
home
school
started
again
and
i
went
in
early
the
first
day
to
turn
in
my
paper
mr
adelson
took
it
without
comment
and
scanned
the
first
few
paragraphs
thank
you
james
i
think
this
will
do
nicely
i
have
it
graded
for
you
in
the
afternoon
i
met
oly
out
in
the
orchard
where
he
was
chopping
kindling
for
the
stove

job

all
took
turns
at

getting
a
new
pa
for
christmas
he
said
he
gave
me
a
smile
that
meant
something
but
i
guess
what
what
is
that
supposed
to
mean
i
asked
my
mama
says
your
mama
had
old
man
johnstone
over
for
christmas
dinner
and
the
widow
ott
told
my
mama
that
she
connected
one
or
two
calls
between
your
house
and
the
store
every
day
in
the
last
month
my
mama
says
that
johnstone
is
courting
your
mama
mrs
ott
is
supposed
to
talk
about
the
calls
she
connects
i
said
as
my
mind
reeled
it
like
a
telegraph
operator
it
a
confidential
trust
mr
adelson
had
told
me
that
once
when
he
was
telling
me
stories
about
his
life
before
he
went
to
sea
so
is
it
true
no
i
said
surprising
myself
with
my
vehemence
my
mama
just
did
want
him
to
be
alone
at
christmas
oly
swung
the
axe
a
few
more
times
well
sure
but
what
about
all
the
telephone
calls
that
business
the
store
is
still
partly
ours
mama
just
looking
after
our
interests
if
you
say
so
he
said
i
shoved
him
hard
i
drew
a
line
in
the
snow
with
my
toe
i
say
so
step
across
the
line
if
you
say
otherwise
oly
got
to
his
feet
and
looked
at
me
i
do
want
to
fight
with
you
james
i
was
just
tellin
you
what
my
mama
said
well
your
mama
ought
to
mind
her
own
business
i
said
baiting
him
that
did
it
he
stepped
over
and
popped
me
one
right
in
the
nose
oly
and
i
had
been
chums
since
we
could
walk
and
we
had
a
few
fights
in
our
days
but
this
time
it
was
different
i
was
so
at
him
at
my
mama
at
my
pa
at
new
jerusalem
and
we
just
kept
on
swinging
at
each
other
until
mr
adelson
came
out
to
ring
the
bell
and
separated
us
my
nose
was
sore
and
i
was
limping
and
torn
oly
jacket
and
bent
his
fingers
back
so
he
cradled
his
hand
in
the
crook
of
his
arm
boys
mr
adelson
said
what
the
hell
do
you
think
you
doing
supposed
to
be
friends
his
language
shocked
me
but
i
was
still
plenty
angry
he
no
friend
of
mine
i
said
that
fine
with
me
oly
said
and
glared
at
me
the
other
kids
were
milling
around
and
mr
adelson
gave
us
both
a
look
that
could
melt
steel
then
rang
the
bell
i
could
hardly
concentrate
in
class
that
day
my
mama
getting
married
a
new
pa
it
could
be
true
but
in
my
mind
i
kept
seeing
my
mama
and
that
johnstone
kissing
under
the
mistletoe
and
him
sitting
in
my
pa
chair
drinking
his
whiskey
oly
desk
was
next
to
mine
and
he
kept
shooting
me
dirty
looks
finally
i
leaned
over
and
whispered
cut
it
out
you
idiot
oly
said
you
the
idiot
i
think
you
got
your
brains
scrambled
in
france
james
i
scramble
your
brains
gentlemen
said
mr
adelson
do
you
have
something
you
like
to
share
with
the
class
no
sir
we
said
together
and
exchanged
glares
james
perhaps
you
like
to
come
up
to
the
front
and
finish
the
lesson
sir
i
said
looking
at
the
blackboard
he
been
going
through
quadratics
an
elaborate
proof
i
believe
you
know
this
already
do
you
come
up
to
the
front
and
finish
the
lesson
slowly
i
got
up
from
my
desk
leaving
my
slate
on
my
desk
and
made
my
way
up
to
the
front
some
of
the
kids
giggled
i
picked
up
a
piece
of
chalk
from
the
and
started
to
write
on
the
board
mr
adelson
walked
back
to
my
seat
and
sat
down
i
stopped
and
looked
over
my
shoulder
and
he
gave
me
a
little
scooting
gesture
that
meant
go
on
i
did
and
by
the
end
of
the
hour
i
found
that
i
was
enjoying
myself
i
stopped
frequently
for
questions
and
erased
the
board
over
and
over
again
filling
it
with
steady
columns
of
numbers
and
equations
i
stopped
noticing
mr
adelson
in
my
seat
and
when
he
stood
and
thanked
me
and
told
us
we
could
eat
our
lunches
it
seemed
like
no
time
at
all
had
passed
mr
adelson
looked
up
from
my
essay
james
i
like
to
have
a
chat
with
you
stay
behind
please
sit
he
said
offering
me
the
chair
at
his
desk
he
sat
on
one
of
the
desks
and
stared
at
me
for
a
long
moment
what
was
that
mess
this
morning
all
about
james
he
asked
oly
and
i
had
an
argument
i
said
sullenly
i
could
see
that
what
was
it
about
if
you
do
mind
my
asking
he
said
something
about
my
mama
i
said
i
see
he
said
well
having
met
your
mother
i
feel
confident
in
saying
that
she
more
than
capable
of
defending
herself
am
i
right
yes
sir
i
said
then
we
wo
see
a
repeat
no
sir
i
said
i
did
plan
on
talking
to
oly
ever
again
then
we
say
no
more
about
it
now
about
this
morning
lesson
you
did
very
well
it
was
a
dirty
trick
i
said
he
grinned
like
a
pirate
i
suppose
it
was
i
would
have
played
it
on
you
if
i
did
have
every
confidence
in
your
abilities
though
he
leaned
across
and
picked
up
my
essay
from
his
desk
it
was
this
that
convinced
me
really
this
is
as
good
as
anything
i
seen
in
scholarly
journals
i
half
a
mind
to
send
it
to
the
i
just
a
kid
you
an
extraordinary
boy
i
tempted
to
let
you
teach
all
the
classes
and
take
up
whittling
he
said
it
so
deadpan
i
could
tell
if
he
was
kidding
me
oh
you
ca
do
that
i
not
nearly
ready
to
take
over
he
laughed
you
readier
than
you
think
but
i
expect
the
town
council
would
stop
my
salary
unless
i
did
of
the
work
around
here
still
i
think
that
the
most
active
i
seen
you
since
you
came
to
my
class
and
i
running
out
of
ideas
to
keep
you
busy
maybe
i
keep
you
teaching
maths
i
give
you
my
lesson
plan
to
take
home
before
school
out
yes
sir
mr
adelson
gave
me
a
stack
of
papers
tied
up
with
twine
after
he
dismissed
the
class
for
the
day
i
went
home
and
did
my
chores
then
unwrapped
the
parcel
in
the
parlour
the
lesson
plans
were
there
laid
out
day
by
day
and
in
the
centre
of
them
was
a
smaller
parcel
wrapped
in
coloured
paper
merry
christmas
was
written
across
it
in
his
hand
i
opened
it
and
found
a
slim
book
war
of
the
worlds
by
verne
for
some
reason
it
rang
a
bell
i
thought
that
maybe
it
had
been
on
our
bookcase
in
but
somehow
it
had
made
it
back
home
with
us
i
opened
it
and
read
the
inscription
he
written
from
one
traveller
to
another
merry
christmas
i
forced
myself
to
read
the
lesson
plans
for
the
next
month
before
i
allowed
myself
to
start
the
verne
and
once
i
started
i
found
i
could
stop
mama
had
to
drag
me
away
for
dinner
my
trip
back
to
was
planned
but
it
was
an
accident
either
gotten
a
new
load
of
hay
in
for
our
team
and
mama
added
stacking
it
in
the
horsebarn
to
my
chores
i
been
consciously
avoiding
the
horsebarn
since
pa
had
disappeared
every
time
i
looked
at
it
i
felt
a
little
hexed
a
little
frightened
but
mama
had
a
philosophy
a
boy
should
face
up
to
his
fears
she
been
terrified
of
spiders
when
she
was
a
girl
and
she
told
me
that
she
had
made
a
point
of
picking
up
every
spider
she
saw
and
letting
it
crawl
around
on
her
face
after
a
year
of
that
she
said
she
never
met
a
spider
that
frightened
her
mama
had
been
sending
me
to
the
store
more
and
more
too
and
having
mr
johnstone
over
for
dinner
every
friday
night
she
knew
i
did
like
him
one
little
bit
and
she
said
that
i
would
just
have
to
learn
to
live
with
what
i
did
like
and
if
that
was
the
only
thing
i
learned
from
her
it
would
be
enough
i
preferred
the
horsebarn
i
worked
close
to
the
door
the
first
day
which
is
no
way
to
do
it
of
course
if
you
blocked
the
door
it
just
made
it
harder
to
get
at
the
back
when
the
time
came
the
way
to
do
it
is
to
first
clear
out
whatever
hay
is
left
over
move
it
out
to
the
pasture
and
then
fill
in
from
the
back
forward
mama
told
me
so
that
first
night
when
she
came
out
to
inspect
my
work
you
sure
must
love
working
out
here
she
said
if
you
do
it
that
way
you
be
out
here
stacking
for
twice
as
long
well
you
have
your
fun
but
i
still
expect
you
to
be
getting
your
homework
and
regular
chores
done
come
in
and
clean
up
for
supper
now
i
jammed
the
pitchfork
into
a
bale
and
washed
for
supper
the
next
afternoon
i
resolved
to
do
it
right
i
moved
the
bales
i
stacked
up
by
the
door
to
a
corner
and
then
started
cleaning
out
the
back
before
long
i
uncovered
the
door
into
james
mama
called
from
the
house
dinner
i
took
a
long
look
at
the
door
the
wood
on
the
edges
had
aged
to
the
of
the
rest
of
the
and
it
looked
like
it
had
been
there
forever
i
could
hardly
remember
a
time
when
it
was
there
i
went
in
for
supper
the
next
morning
i
picked
up
my
lunch
and
my
schoolbooks
kissed
mama
and
walked
out
i
stood
on
our
porch
for
a
long
time
staring
at
the
horsebarn
i
remembered
the
brave
explorers
in
verne
books
i
looked
over
my
shoulder
at
the
closed
door
of
our
house
then
walked
slowly
to
the
horsebarn
i
swung
the
door
open
then
walked
to
the
back
the
had
rusted
somewhat
and
took
real
shoving
to
slide
back
one
of
them
was
stubborn
so
i
picked
up
the
rake
and
pried
it
back
with
the
handle
thinking
of
how
ingenious
that
was
i
gave
the
door
my
shoulder
and
shoved
and
it
swung
back
complaining
on
its
hinges
on
the
other
side
was
the
dark
of
our
apartment
i
stepped
into
it
and
closed
the
door
behind
me
lights
i
said
and
they
came
on
the
old
place
was
just
like
the
day
we
left
it
it
was
even
dusty
and
as
i
heard
the
familiar
trundle
of
the
robutler
i
knew
why
my
pa
easy
chair
sat
in
the
parlour
with
a
of
the
day
lake
city
folded
on
the
i
walked
to
one
wall
and
laid
my
palm
against
it
the
familiar
cool
glassy
stuff
it
was
made
of
window
i
said
and
wiped
a
line
across
the
wall
wherever
my
hand
wiped
went
transparent
it
was
a
sunny
day
in
by
then
but
it
would
be
in
my
mind
forever
under
the
dome
greater
salt
lake
was
warm
and
tranquil
i
saw
boys
my
age
scooting
around
in
dodging
pa
liked
to
open
a
big
square
window
when
he
came
home
and
sit
in
his
easy
chair
and
smoke
a
stinky
cigar
and
read
the
paper
and
cluck
over
it
well
well
well
he
say
and
how
that
sometimes
he
have
a
tumbler
of
whiskey
he
given
me
some
once
and
the
stuff
had
burned
like
turpentine
and
i
swore
i
would
try
it
again
for
a
long
long
time
i
sat
in
pa
easy
chair
and
snapped
up
the
newspaper
the
way
he
used
to
panorama
i
said
and
pa
square
window
opened
before
me
whiskey
i
said
and
cigar
because
i
was
never
one
for
the
robutler
trundled
over
to
me
with
a
tumbler
and
a
white
owl
in
its
i
plucked
them
out
cautiously
i
put
the
cigar
between
my
lips
the
robutler
extruded
a
long
snaky
arm
with
a
flame
and
lit
it
i
took
a
deep
puff
and
coughed
convulsively
unthinking
i
took
a
gulp
of
whiskey
i
felt
like
my
lungs
had
turned
i
finished
both
the
whiskey
and
the
cigar
before
i
got
up
taking
cautious
puffs
and
tiny
sips
forcing
myself
my
head
swam
and
nausea
nearly
drowned
me
i
staggered
into
the
wc
and
hung
my
head
in
the
oubliette
for
an
eternity
but
nothing
was
coming
up
i
moved
into
my
old
bedroom
and
splayed
out
on
my
bed
watching
the
ceiling
spin
lights
i
managed
to
croak
and
the
room
went
dark
when
i
woke
in
the
morning
the
walls
were
at
the
normal
schedule
and
i
dragged
myself
out
of
bed
the
robutler
had
extruded
the
table
and
set
out
my
breakfast
ham
and
eggs
and
a
big
bulb
of
milk
one
look
at
it
sent
me
over
the
edge
and
i
left
a
trail
of
sick
all
the
way
to
the
wc
when
i
was
done
i
was
as
as
a
washcloth
my
head
pounded
the
robutler
was
quietly
cleaning
up
my
mess
i
started
to
order
it
to
clear
away
breakfast
but
discovered
that
i
was
miraculously
hungry
i
ate
everything
on
the
table
and
seconds
besides
and
had
the
robutler
juice
my
temples
and
clear
away
my
headache
i
dialed
the
walls
to
full
transparency
and
watched
the
traffic
go
by
the
robutler
maneuvered
itself
into
my
field
of
vision
and
flashed
a
clock
on
its
it
was
my
old
it
snapped
me
back
to
reality
my
mama
was
going
to
whip
me
raw
she
must
been
worried
sick
i
stood
up
and
ran
for
the
door
it
was
closed
i
punched
my
code
into
its
panel
and
waited
nothing
happened
i
calmed
myself
and
punched
it
again
still
nothing
after
trying
it
a
hundred
times
i
convinced
myself
that
it
had
been
changed
i
summoned
the
robutler
and
asked
it
for
the
code
its
lit
up
bad
program
that
when
i
started
to
really
worry
i
was
near
to
tears
when
i
remembered
the
emergency
override
i
punched
it
in
nothing
happened
i
think
i
started
crying
around
then
i
was
stuck
in
i
not
a
stupid
little
kid
i
did
spend
much
time
pewling
instead
i
went
to
the
phone
and
dialed
the
police
the
screen
stayed
blank
feeling
like
i
was
in
a
dream
i
went
to
the
teleporter
and
dialed
for
my
old
school
and
stepped
in
i
failed
to
teleport
reality
sank
in
all
outside
services
to
the
apartment
had
been
shut
off
when
we
moved
out
the
only
things
that
still
worked
were
the
ones
that
ran
off
our
reactor
a
squat
armoured
box
on
the
apartment
underbelly
the
door
in
new
jerusalem
worked
but
on
the
side
it
needed
to
communicate
with
the
central
office
to
approve
any
passage
i
thought
about
sitting
tight
and
waiting
mama
would
be
sick
with
worry
and
would
check
the
barn
eventually
and
see
the
shot
bolts
she
speak
to
mr
johnstone
who
would
send
a
telegram
to
paris
and
they
would
relay
the
message
to
and
i
be
rescued
i
get
the
whipping
of
my
life
and
do
extra
chores
until
i
was
seventy
but
it
was
better
than
starving
to
death
after
the
apartment
pantry
ran
out
i
felt
hungry
just
thinking
about
it
still
there
was
a
better
way
the
doughnut
that
our
apartment
was
spoked
into
had
a
supply
of
with
a
simple
transponder
that
screamed
for
help
on
all
the
emergency
channels
i
could
ride
one
of
these
down
into
greater
salt
lake
wait
for
the
police
the
more
i
thought
about
this
plan
the
better
it
sounded
better
anyway
than
sitting
around
like
a
fairytale
princess
waiting
for
rescue
in
my
mind
i
was
the
rescuing
type
not
the
kind
that
needed
rescuing
besides
there
was
much
better
than
riding
around
in
one
of
those
i
cycled
the
emergency
lock
into
the
doughnut
unracked
a
pack
and
a
jumpsuit
that
looked
like
it
would
fit
me
and
suited
up
the
packed
whined
as
it
powered
up
and
ran
through
its
diagnostics
i
checked
the
to
make
sure
they
were
all
green
feeling
like
a
real
man
of
action
then
i
stepped
into
the
exterior
lock
and
jumped
arms
and
legs
streamlined
toes
pointed
the
coughed
to
life
and
kicked
me
gently
then
started
lowering
me
to
the
ground
the
emergency
beacon
came
on
and
i
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
and
got
comfortable
the
flight
was
peaceful
and
dreamlike
a
slow
descent
over
the
gleaming
metal
city
i
was
so
engrossed
with
the
view
that
i
did
see
the
packjackers
until
they
were
already
on
me
they
hit
me
high
and
low
two
kids
about
my
age
with
custom
with
their
traffic
beacons
broken
off
one
snagged
my
knees
and
hugged
them
to
his
chest
while
the
other
took
me
at
the
armpits
a
voice
shouted
in
my
ear
i
cutting
your
pack
loose
this
is
a
very
very
sharp
knife
and
when
i
done
i
be
the
only
thing
holding
you
up
i
did
even
have
the
chance
to
squirm
by
the
time
the
speech
was
finished
i
was
separated
from
my
pack
and
i
spun
over
and
watched
it
continue
its
descent
straps
dangling
in
the
wind
my
hair
hung
down
and
blood
filled
my
head
reawakening
my
headache
reflexively
i
twisted
to
get
a
look
at
my
kidnappers
but
stopped
immediately
as
i
felt
their
grips
loosen
i
squeezed
my
eyes
shut
and
prayed
the
three
of
us
dove
fast
and
hard
and
i
tasted
that
second
helping
of
breakfast
again
before
we
leveled
off
i
risked
a
peek
then
squeezed
my
eyes
shut
again
we
were
speeding
through
the
lower
levels
of
greater
salt
lake
the
unmanned
freight
corridors
impossibly
claustrophobic
and
at
our
speed
dangerous
we
cornered
tightly
so
many
times
that
i
lost
count
and
then
we
slowed
to
a
stop
they
dumped
me
to
the
ground
steel
the
wind
was
knocked
out
of
me
and
i
was
barely
conscious
of
the
hands
that
untabbed
my
jumpsuit
then
began
methodically
turning
out
the
pockets
of
my
clothes
what
the
hell
are
you
wearing
kid
one
of
them
asked
it
was
the
same
one
who
warned
me
about
squirming
hearing
his
voice
a
second
time
i
realised
that
he
was
younger
than
i
was
maybe
ten
or
eleven
even
then
it
did
occur
to
me
to
fight
back
he
had
a
knife
sharp
enough
to
cut
through
the
safety
strapping
on
my
pack
clothes
i
from
my
pa
an
ambassador
i
do
have
any
money
i
struggled
into
a
sitting
position
and
was
knocked
onto
my
back
again
stay
down
and
you
wo
get
hurt
the
same
voice
said
it
was
young
enough
that
i
could
tell
if
it
was
a
boy
or
a
girl
small
hands
pressed
into
my
eyes
no
peeking
now
another
set
of
hands
systematically
rifled
my
coat
and
pants
then
cut
them
loose
and
gave
the
same
treatment
to
my
underpants
and
shirt
i
blushed
as
they
were
cut
loose
too
you
really
do
have
any
money
the
voice
said
i
said
so
did
i
the
voice
said
a
dirty
word
that
would
gotten
it
beaten
back
home
and
then
the
hands
were
gone
i
looked
up
just
in
time
to
see
two
small
figures
jetting
away
upwards
i
was
naked
sitting
on
a
catwalk
above
a
freight
corridor
of
a
century
and
miles
from
home
i
did
cry
i
was
too
worried
to
cry
i
kicked
my
ruined
clothes
down
into
the
freight
corridor
and
pulled
on
the
jumpsuit
some
hero
i
was
it
was
hard
work
climbing
staircase
after
staircase
up
to
the
shopping
levels
by
the
time
i
reached
a
level
where
i
could
see
the
sky
i
was
dripping
with
sweat
and
my
headache
had
returned
foot
traffic
was
light
but
what
there
was
pretty
frightening
i
gone
walking
in
before
of
course
but
greater
salt
lake
was
a
big
place
and
there
were
parts
of
it
that
an
ambassador
son
would
never
get
to
see
this
was
one
of
them
the
shopfronts
were
all
airlocks
and
had
been
painted
around
to
look
like
surprised
mouths
or
eyes
or
in
one
fascinating
case
a
woman
private
parts
mostly
they
were
betting
shops
or
bars
or
bounceaterias
even
in
the
saints
had
some
influence
in
salt
lake
and
the
bars
and
brothels
were
pretty
shameful
places
where
no
respectable
person
would
be
caught
the
other
pedestrians
on
the
street
were
mostly
either
spacers
in
uniform
or
extees
in
some
cases
it
was
hard
to
tell
which
was
which
i
kind
of
slunk
along
sticking
to
the
walls
hands
in
my
pockets
i
kept
my
eyes
down
except
when
i
was
looking
around
for
a
public
phone
after
several
blocks
i
realised
that
no
one
was
paying
any
attention
to
me
and
i
took
my
hands
out
of
my
pockets
the
sun
filtered
down
over
me
warm
through
the
big
dome
and
i
realised
that
even
though
i
gotten
myself
stuck
in
been
and
left
in
the
worst
neighbourhood
in
the
whole
state
i
landed
on
my
feet
the
thought
made
me
smile
another
kid
say
oly
would
have
coped
nearly
as
well
i
still
had
spied
a
public
phone
i
figured
that
the
taprooms
would
have
a
phone
otherwise
how
could
a
drunk
call
his
wife
and
tell
her
he
was
going
to
be
late
coming
home
i
picked
a
bar
whose
airlock
was
painted
to
look
like
a
brick
tunnel
and
walked
in
the
airlock
irised
shut
behind
me
and
i
blinked
in
the
gloom
my
nose
was
assaulted
with
sickly
sweet
incense
and
stale
liquor
and
cigar
smoke
the
place
was
tiny
and
crowded
with
dented
metal
tables
and
chairs
that
were
bolted
to
the
floorplates
a
woman
stood
behind
the
bar
looking
hard
and
brassy
and
cheap
watching
a
soap
opera
on
her
vid
a
spacer
sat
in
one
corner
staring
at
his
bulb
of
beer
the
bartender
looked
up
get
lost
kid
she
said
no
minors
allowed
sorry
i
said
i
just
wanted
to
use
your
telephone
i
was
packjacked
and
i
need
to
call
the
police
the
bartender
turned
back
to
her
soap
opera
go
peddle
it
somewhere
else
sonny
the
phone
for
customers
only
please
i
said
my
father
an
ambassador
from
i
do
have
any
money
and
i
stuck
here
i
wo
be
a
minute
the
spacer
looked
up
from
his
drink
get
lost
the
lady
said
he
slurred
at
me
i
buy
something
i
said
you
just
said
you
do
have
any
money
the
bartender
said
i
pay
for
it
when
the
police
get
here
the
embassy
will
cover
it
no
credit
she
said
you
not
going
to
let
me
use
your
phone
i
said
that
right
she
said
still
staring
at
her
vid
i
a
stranger
an
ambassador
son
who
been
robbed
a
kid
stuck
here
broke
and
alone
and
you
wo
let
me
use
your
phone
to
call
the
police
that
about
the
size
of
things
she
said
well
i
guess
my
pa
was
right
the
whole
world
went
to
hell
after
no
manners
no
human
decency
you
breaking
my
heart
she
said
fine
be
that
way
send
me
back
out
on
the
street
deny
me
a
favour
that
cost
you
one
red
cent
just
because
i
a
stranger
shut
kid
for
chrissakes
the
spacer
said
i
stand
him
to
a
coke
if
that
what
it
takes
just
let
him
use
the
phone
and
get
out
of
here
giving
me
a
headache
thank
you
sir
i
said
politely
the
bartender
switched
her
vid
over
to
phone
mode
poured
me
a
coke
and
handed
me
the
vid
the
policeman
who
showed
up
a
few
minutes
later
stuck
me
in
the
back
of
his
cruiser
listened
to
my
story
scanned
my
retinas
confirmed
my
identity
and
retracted
the
armour
between
the
back
and
front
seats
i
take
you
to
the
station
house
he
said
we
contact
your
embassy
let
them
handle
it
from
there
what
about
the
kids
who
me
i
asked
the
cop
turned
the
jetcar
conn
over
to
mode
and
turned
around
you
got
any
description
well
they
had
really
nice
packs
on
with
the
traffic
beacons
snapped
off
one
was
red
and
i
think
the
other
was
green
and
they
were
young
ten
or
eleven
the
cop
punched
at
his
screen
kid
he
said
i
got
over
three
million
minors
eight
to
eleven
flying
packs
less
than
a
year
old
the
most
popular
colour
is
red
second
choice
green
where
would
you
like
me
to
start
alphabetically
sorry
sir
i
did
realise
sure
he
said
whatever
i
guess
i
not
thinking
very
clearly
it
been
a
long
day
the
cop
looked
over
to
me
and
smiled
i
guess
it
has
at
that
do
worry
kid
we
get
you
home
all
right
they
gave
me
a
fresh
jumpsuit
sat
me
on
a
bench
called
the
embassy
and
forgot
about
me
a
long
boring
time
later
a
fat
man
with
walrus
moustaches
and
ruddy
skin
showed
up
on
your
feet
lad
he
said
i
pondicherry
your
father
successor
made
quite
a
mess
of
things
have
you
he
had
a
clipped
british
accent
with
a
hint
of
something
else
i
remembered
mr
johnstone
saying
he
been
in
india
he
wore
a
standard
unisex
jumpsuit
with
his
ambassadorial
sash
overtop
of
it
he
looked
ridiculous
sorry
to
have
disturbed
you
sir
i
said
i
sure
you
are
he
said
come
along
we
see
about
fixing
this
mess
he
used
the
station
teleporter
to
bring
me
to
his
apartment
it
was
as
ridiculous
as
his
uniform
and
in
the
same
way
he
taken
the
basic
elegant
simplicity
of
a
standard
unit
and
draped
all
kinds
of
silly
trophies
and
models
overtop
of
it
lions
heads
and
sabers
and
model
ships
and
framed
medals
and
savage
masks
and
dolls
you
may
look
but
not
touch
do
you
understand
me
he
said
as
we
stepped
out
of
the
teleporter
yes
sir
i
said
if
anyone
else
had
said
it
i
would
have
been
offended
but
coming
from
this
pigeon
it
did
sting
much
he
went
to
a
vid
and
punched
impatiently
at
the
screen
while
i
prowled
the
apartment
the
bookcase
was
full
of
old
friends
books
by
the
frenchman
of
course
and
more
with
strange
names
like
wells
and
burroughs
and
shelley
i
looked
over
a
long
spear
and
the
curve
of
an
elephant
tusk
and
a
collection
of
campaign
ribbons
and
medals
under
glass
i
returned
to
the
bookcase
something
had
been
bothering
me
there
there
it
was
war
of
the
worlds
the
book
that
mr
adelson
had
given
me
for
christmas
but
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
spine
of
this
one
instead
of
the
author
name
was
i
snuck
a
look
over
my
shoulder
pondicherry
was
still
stabbing
at
the
screen
i
snuck
the
book
off
the
shelf
and
turned
to
the
title
page
war
of
the
worlds
by
herbert
george
wells
i
turned
to
the
first
chapter
the
eve
of
the
war
no
one
would
have
believed
in
the
last
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
that
this
world
was
being
watched
keenly
and
closely
by
intelligences
greater
than
and
yet
as
mortal
as
his
own
that
as
men
busied
themselves
about
their
various
concerns
they
were
scrutinised
and
studied
perhaps
almost
as
narrowly
as
a
man
with
a
microscope
might
scrutinise
the
transient
creatures
that
swarm
and
multiply
in
a
drop
of
water
it
was
just
as
i
remembered
it
every
word
just
as
it
was
in
the
verne
i
could
begin
to
explain
it
a
robutler
swung
out
of
its
niche
with
a
sheaf
of
papers
i
startled
at
the
noise
then
reflexively
stuck
the
book
in
my
jumpsuit
the
roboutler
delivered
them
to
pondicherry
who
stuffed
them
in
a
briefcase
the
embassy
will
be
able
to
return
you
home
by
courier
route
in
three
hours
unfortunately
i
do
have
the
luxury
of
waiting
around
here
until
then
i
have
an
important
meeting
to
attend
you
have
to
come
along
yes
sir
i
said
trying
to
sound
eager
and
helpful
do
say
anything
do
touch
anything
this
is
very
sensitive
no
sir
i
wo
thank
you
sir
the
meeting
was
in
a
private
room
in
a
fancy
restaurant
one
that
i
been
to
before
for
an
embassy
christmas
party
mama
had
drunk
two
glasses
of
sherry
and
had
flushed
right
to
the
neck
of
her
dress
we
had
roast
beef
and
a
goose
wrapped
inside
a
huge
squash
the
size
of
a
barrel
like
they
grew
on
the
moon
pondicherry
whisked
through
the
lobby
and
the
main
dining
room
and
then
up
a
narrow
set
of
stairs
without
checking
to
see
if
i
was
following
i
dawdled
a
little
remembering
pa
laughing
and
raising
his
glass
in
toast
after
toast
i
caught
up
with
pondicherry
just
as
he
was
ordering
speaking
brusquely
into
the
table
another
man
sat
opposite
him
pondicherry
looked
up
at
me
and
said
have
you
dined
boy
no
sir
he
ordered
me
a
plate
of
calf
livers
in
cream
sauce
which
is
about
the
worst
thing
you
can
feed
a
boy
if
you
ask
me
which
he
did
sit
down
he
said
mr
nussbaum
master
james
nicholson
i
am
temporarily
in
until
he
can
be
sent
home
nussbaum
smiled
and
extended
his
hand
he
was
wearing
a
grey
suit
with
a
strange
cut
and
a
black
tie
his
fingers
dripped
with
heavy
gold
rings
and
his
hair
while
short
still
managed
to
look
fancy
and
a
little
good
to
meetcha
son
you
lester
boy
yes
sir
he
was
my
good
man
a
damned
shame
what
are
you
doing
here
playing
hooky
i
guess
i
just
got
lost
i
going
home
soon
as
they
can
get
me
there
is
that
so
well
i
be
sad
to
see
you
go
you
look
like
a
smart
kid
you
like
chocolate
cake
i
bet
sometimes
i
said
like
when
when
my
mama
makes
it
with
a
glass
of
milk
after
school
i
said
he
laughed
a
strangled
you
guys
kill
me
your
mama
huh
well
they
make
some
fine
chocolate
cake
here
though
it
may
not
be
as
good
as
the
stuff
from
home
he
thumbed
the
table
sweetie
send
up
the
biggest
piece
of
chocolate
cake
you
got
down
there
and
a
glass
a
milk
willya
the
table
acknowledged
his
request
with
a
soft
green
light
thank
you
sir
i
said
that
quite
enough
i
think
pondicherry
said
i
did
come
here
to
watch
you
rot
young
james
teeth
can
we
get
to
business
pondicherry
started
talking
in
rapid
clipped
sentences
punctuated
by
vicious
bites
of
his
food
i
tried
to
follow
what
it
was
about
trading
buffalo
steaks
for
rare
metals
i
got
that
much
but
not
much
more
the
calves
livers
were
worse
than
i
imagined
and
i
hid
as
much
of
them
as
i
could
under
the
potatoes
then
pushed
the
plate
away
and
dug
into
the
cake
i
sneaked
a
look
up
and
saw
that
nussbaum
was
grinning
slyly
at
me
he
said
much
just
ate
calmly
and
waited
for
pondicherry
to
run
out
of
steam
he
caught
my
eye
and
slipped
a
wink
at
me
i
looked
over
at
pondicherry
who
was
noisily
cudding
a
piece
of
steak
oblivious
and
winked
back
at
nussbaum
pondicherry
daubbed
at
his
mouth
with
his
napkin
excuse
me
he
said
i
be
right
back
he
stood
and
walked
towards
the
wc
nussbaum
suddenly
jingled
distractledly
he
patted
his
pockets
until
he
located
a
tiny
phone
he
flipped
it
open
and
grunted
nussbaum
into
it
jules
he
said
a
moment
later
how
things
he
scowled
as
he
listened
to
the
answer
now
you
and
i
know
that
there
a
difference
between
and
i
think
it
a
bad
idea
he
listened
some
more
and
drummed
his
fingers
on
the
table
because
it
not
dammit
even
the
title
is
anachronistic
no
one
in
is
going
to
understand
what
means
think
about
it
wouldya
why
do
you
do
some
of
twain
stuff
those
books
got
my
jaw
dropped
nussbaum
was
talking
to
the
frenchman
and
he
was
helping
him
to
to
steal
from
mark
twain
i
was
suddenly
conscious
of
war
of
the
worlds
down
the
front
of
my
jumpsuit
i
thought
back
to
mr
assignment
and
it
all
made
sudden
sense
verne
was
a
nussbaum
hung
up
just
as
pondicherry
himself
he
took
a
sip
of
his
drink
then
held
up
a
hand
pondicherry
eyed
him
coldly
look
nussbaum
said
we
gone
over
this
a
few
times
ok
i
know
where
you
stand
you
know
where
i
stand
we
not
standing
in
the
same
place
much
as
i
enjoy
your
company
i
do
really
wan
na
spend
the
whole
day
listening
to
you
repeating
yourself
all
right
really
i
do
think
pondicherry
started
but
nussbaum
held
up
his
hand
again
that
all
right
i
a
rude
and
i
know
it
let
just
take
it
as
read
that
you
and
me
spent
the
whole
afternoon
letting
the
other
fella
know
how
sincere
our
positions
are
then
we
can
move
onto
cocktails
and
compromise
and
maybe
have
some
of
the
day
left
over
pondicherry
started
to
talk
again
but
nussbaum
plowed
over
him
i
go
to
six
troy
ounces
per
steer
you
get
a
better
offer
pure
ores
better
than
anything
you
ever
refine
back
home
it
as
far
as
i
go
sir
is
that
an
ultimatum
pondicherry
asked
his
eyes
narrowing
call
it
whatever
you
please
buster
it
my
final
offer
you
like
it
i
can
talk
to
the
chinaman
he
seemed
pretty
eager
to
get
some
good
metal
home
to
the
emperor
you
would
he
too
far
back
it
would
violate
the
protocols
that
what
you
say
it
may
be
what
the
trade
court
decides
i
take
my
chances
six
and
a
half
ounces
pondicherry
said
in
a
voice
you
do
hear
so
good
do
you
six
ounces
is
the
offer
on
the
table
take
it
or
leave
it
nussbaum
pushed
some
papers
across
the
table
pondicherry
stared
at
them
for
a
long
moment
i
will
sign
them
sir
but
it
is
with
the
expectation
of
continued
trade
opportunities
this
is
a
gesture
do
you
understand
nussbaum
snorted
and
reached
for
his
papers
this
is
about
steaks
and
metals
this
is
about
the
future
it
about
today
now
that
what
on
the
table
you
can
sign
it
or
you
can
walk
away
pondicherry
blew
air
out
his
nose
like
a
crazy
horse
and
signed
if
excuse
me
i
need
to
use
the
wc
again
he
rose
and
left
the
room
purple
from
the
collar
up
what
a
maroon
nussbaum
said
to
the
closed
door
this
got
ta
be
a
real
blast
for
you
huh
he
said
i
grinned
it
not
so
bad
i
liked
watchin
you
hogtie
him
he
laughed
i
never
would
tried
that
on
your
father
kid
he
was
too
sharp
but
fatso
there
he
terrified
the
chinaman
will
give
the
middle
kingdom
an
edge
when
it
faces
down
his
royal
navy
all
it
takes
is
the
slightest
hint
and
he
folds
like
a
cheap
suit
that
made
me
chuckle
a
cheap
suit
i
gave
him
my
best
innocent
look
who
else
knows
about
the
frenchman
i
asked
him
nussbaum
grinned
like
he
been
caught
with
his
hand
in
the
cookie
jar
i
realised
about
halfway
through
that
conversation
that
being
lester
boy
probably
read
just
about
every
word
old
jules
i
have
i
said
i
took
out
war
of
the
worlds
how
does
mr
wells
feel
about
this
i
asked
i
imagine
he
pretty
mystified
nussbaum
said
would
you
believe
you
the
first
one
who
caught
on
i
believed
it
i
knew
enough
to
know
that
the
agencies
that
policed
the
protocols
had
their
hands
full
keeping
track
of
art
and
gold
smugglers
never
even
thought
of
smuggling
if
the
trade
courts
found
out
well
hardly
a
week
went
by
that
someone
did
propose
shutting
down
the
ambassadorships
they
talk
about
how
the
future
kept
on
leaking
pastwards
and
if
we
thought
looked
bad
imagine
life
in
once
the
future
reached
it
the
ambassadors
had
made
a
lot
of
friends
in
high
places
though
they
used
their
influence
to
keep
things
on
an
even
keel
nussbaum
raised
an
eyebrow
and
studied
me
i
think
your
father
may
figured
it
out
but
he
kept
it
to
himself
he
and
jules
got
along
like
a
house
on
fire
i
kept
the
innocent
look
on
my
face
well
then
i
said
if
pa
did
say
anything
you
think
that
i
would
either
right
nussbaum
sighed
and
gave
me
a
sheepish
look
i
to
think
so
he
said
i
turned
the
book
over
in
my
hands
keeping
my
gaze
locked
with
his
i
was
about
to
tell
him
that
i
keep
it
to
myself
but
at
the
last
minute
some
instinct
told
me
to
keep
my
mouth
shut
nussbaum
shrugged
as
though
to
say
give
hey
you
headed
home
today
right
he
said
carefully
yes
sir
i
got
a
message
that
you
could
maybe
relay
for
me
you
think
i
guess
so
i
said
doubtfully
i
make
it
worth
your
while
it
got
to
go
to
a
friend
of
mine
in
frisco
there
no
hurry
just
make
sure
he
gets
it
in
the
next
ten
years
or
so
once
you
deliver
it
he
take
care
of
you
you
be
set
for
life
gosh
i
said
deadpan
are
you
game
i
guess
so
sure
my
heart
skipped
set
for
life
the
man
you
want
to
speak
to
is
reddekop
he
the
organist
at
the
castro
theatre
tell
him
says
get
out
by
october
he
know
what
it
means
you
got
that
reddekop
castro
theatre
october
he
slid
war
of
the
worlds
into
his
briefcase
you
me
a
hell
of
a
favour
son
he
shook
my
hand
pondicherry
came
back
in
then
and
glared
at
me
the
embassy
contacted
me
they
can
set
you
at
home
six
months
after
you
left
there
a
courier
gateway
this
afternoon
six
months
i
said
my
mama
will
go
crazy
ca
you
get
me
home
any
sooner
pondicherry
smirked
do
complain
to
me
boy
you
dug
this
hole
yourself
the
next
scheduled
courier
going
anywhere
near
your
is
in
five
years
we
send
notice
to
your
mother
then
to
expect
you
home
tough
break
kiddo
nussbaum
said
and
he
shook
my
hand
and
slipped
me
another
wink
the
courier
gateway
let
me
out
in
an
alleyway
in
salt
lake
city
the
embassy
had
given
me
ten
wells
fargo
dollars
and
fitted
me
out
with
a
pair
of
jeans
and
a
workshirt
that
were
both
far
too
big
for
me
so
that
they
slopped
around
me
as
i
made
my
way
to
the
train
station
and
bought
my
ticket
to
new
jerusalem
it
was
wednesday
the
normal
schedule
for
the
zephyr
speedball
so
i
did
have
too
long
to
wait
at
the
station
i
bought
copies
of
the
salt
lake
city
and
the
san
francisco
from
a
passing
newsie
the
was
a
week
old
but
it
was
filled
with
all
sorts
of
fascinating
gossip
i
read
it
on
the
long
ride
to
new
jerusalem
mama
met
me
at
the
train
station
i
been
expecting
a
switching
right
then
and
there
but
instead
she
hugged
me
fiercely
with
tears
in
her
eyes
i
remembered
that
it
had
been
over
six
months
for
her
since
i
gone
james
you
will
be
the
death
of
me
i
swear
she
said
after
she
squeezed
every
last
bit
of
stuffing
out
of
me
i
sorry
mama
i
said
we
had
to
tell
everyone
you
gone
away
to
school
in
france
a
familiar
male
voice
said
i
looked
up
and
saw
mr
johnstone
standing
a
few
yards
away
with
our
team
and
trap
he
was
glaring
at
me
i
had
the
barn
gateway
sealed
permanently
on
both
sides
i
sorry
sir
i
said
but
inside
i
was
even
though
i
only
been
away
for
a
few
days
i
had
the
adventure
of
a
lifetime
smoked
and
drank
and
been
and
escaped
and
received
a
secret
message
my
mama
seemed
shorter
to
me
and
frailer
and
james
h
johnstone
was
a
nothing
of
a
poltroon
we
put
it
behind
us
son
he
said
but
from
now
on
there
will
be
order
in
our
household
do
we
understand
house
i
looked
up
sharply
at
my
mama
she
smiled
at
me
nervously
we
married
james
a
month
ago
congratulate
me
i
thought
about
it
my
mama
needed
someone
around
to
take
care
of
her
and
after
all
it
was
right
for
her
to
be
all
alone
with
a
start
i
realised
that
in
my
mind
i
left
my
mama
house
i
felt
the
notes
in
my
pocket
congratulations
mama
congratulations
mr
johnstone
mama
hugged
me
again
and
the
mr
johnstone
drove
us
home
in
the
trap
all
through
the
rest
of
the
day
mama
kept
looking
worriedly
at
me
whenever
she
thought
i
was
watching
i
pretended
not
to
notice
and
did
my
chores
then
took
my
out
to
the
apple
orchard
behind
the
academy
i
sat
beneath
a
big
shady
tree
and
the
paper
all
the
curious
bits
and
pieces
of
a
city
frozen
in
time
i
was
hardly
surprised
to
see
mr
adelson
nor
did
he
seem
surprised
to
see
me
back
from
france
james
yes
sir
looks
like
it
did
you
some
good
though
i
must
say
we
missed
you
around
the
academy
it
just
was
the
same
have
you
been
keeping
up
your
writing
sorry
sir
i
have
there
has
been
time
i
thinking
about
writing
an
adventure
story
though
about
pirates
and
and
airships
i
said
that
sound
exciting
he
sat
down
beside
me
and
we
sat
there
in
silence
for
a
time
watching
the
flies
buzz
around
the
air
was
sweet
with
apple
blossoms
and
the
only
sound
was
the
wind
in
the
trees
i
going
to
miss
this
place
i
said
unthinking
me
too
mr
adelson
said
our
eyes
locked
and
a
slow
smile
spread
over
his
face
well
i
know
where
going
but
where
are
you
off
to
son
you
going
away
i
said
yes
sir
is
that
a
copy
of
the
give
it
here
i
show
you
something
he
flipped
through
the
pages
and
pointed
to
an
advertisement
the
is
in
port
and
they
signing
on
crew
for
a
run
through
the
south
seas
in
september
i
intend
to
go
as
quartermaster
you
leaving
i
said
shocked
to
my
boots
to
my
surprise
he
pulled
out
a
pouch
of
tobacco
and
some
rolling
papers
and
rolled
himself
a
cigarette
i
never
seen
a
schoolteacher
smoking
before
he
took
a
thoughtful
puff
and
blew
the
smoke
out
into
the
sky
to
tell
you
the
truth
james
i
just
do
think
i
cut
out
for
this
line
of
work
not
enough
excitement
in
a
town
like
this
i
never
been
happier
than
i
was
when
i
was
at
sea
and
that
as
good
a
reason
to
go
back
as
any
i
miss
you
though
son
you
were
a
delight
to
teach
but
what
will
i
do
i
said
why
i
expect
your
mother
will
send
you
back
east
to
go
to
school
i
graduated
you
from
the
academy
during
the
last
week
of
classes
your
report
card
and
diploma
are
waiting
on
my
desk
graduated
i
said
shocked
i
had
another
year
to
go
at
the
academy
do
look
so
surprised
there
was
no
earthly
reason
for
you
to
stay
at
the
academy
i
say
you
were
ready
for
college
myself
maybe
harvard
he
tousled
my
hair
i
allowed
myself
a
smile
i
did
think
i
was
any
smarter
than
the
other
kids
but
i
sure
knew
a
whole
lot
more
about
the
world
the
worlds
and
maybe
in
my
heart
of
hearts
i
knew
that
i
was
a
smarter
i
miss
you
sir
i
said
call
me
robert
school
out
where
are
you
off
to
james
i
gestured
with
my
copy
of
the
my
home
town
whatever
for
i
looked
at
my
shoes
oh
a
secret
i
see
well
i
wo
pry
does
your
mother
know
about
this
i
felt
like
kicking
myself
if
i
said
no
he
have
to
tell
her
if
i
said
yes
i
only
have
myself
to
blame
if
he
spilled
the
news
to
her
i
looked
at
him
and
he
blew
a
streamer
of
smoke
into
the
sky
no
sir
i
said
no
robert
he
looked
at
me
he
winked
better
keep
it
to
ourselves
then
he
said
the
at
the
castro
theatre
was
any
older
than
i
was
but
she
wore
her
hair
shorter
than
some
of
the
boys
i
known
back
home
and
more
makeup
than
even
the
painted
ladies
at
the
saloon
she
looked
at
me
like
i
was
some
kind
of
fool
it
was
a
look
i
was
getting
used
to
seeing
reddekop
only
plays
for
the
shows
kid
no
organ
for
the
who
you
calling
a
kid
i
said
i
kept
a
civil
tongue
ever
since
debarking
the
train
treating
adult
and
kid
with
equal
respect
but
i
was
getting
sick
of
being
treated
like
a
yokel
i
been
farther
than
any
of
these
dusty
slickers
would
ever
go
and
i
was
grown
enough
that
i
told
my
mama
and
mr
johnstone
that
i
was
going
off
on
my
own
instead
of
just
leaving
a
note
like
originally
planned
you
kid
you
want
to
talk
to
reddekop
you
come
back
after
six
in
the
meantime
you
can
either
buy
a
ticket
to
the
matinee
or
get
lost
on
reflection
telling
my
mama
was
probably
a
mistake
it
meant
that
i
was
locked
in
my
room
for
two
consecutive
wednesdays
so
that
i
could
catch
the
train
on
the
third
wednesday
i
climbed
out
onto
the
roof
and
then
went
down
the
i
hidden
behind
a
chimney
the
wells
fargo
notes
i
started
with
were
almost
gone
mostly
spent
on
the
expensive
food
on
the
train
i
had
dared
try
to
sneak
any
food
away
from
home
my
mama
was
no
fool
i
thought
about
buying
a
ticket
to
the
matinee
i
still
had
almost
five
dollars
but
a
quick
look
at
the
menus
in
the
restaurants
had
taught
me
that
if
i
thought
the
food
on
the
train
was
expensive
i
had
another
think
coming
i
shouldered
my
rucksack
and
wandered
away
taking
care
to
avoid
the
filth
from
dogs
and
people
that
littered
the
sidewalks
i
told
myself
that
i
was
homesick
just
tired
october
huh
reddekop
was
a
small
german
with
a
greying
spade
beard
and
a
heavily
oiled
part
in
his
long
hair
his
fingers
were
long
and
nimble
but
nearly
everything
else
about
him
was
short
and
crude
he
made
me
nervous
yes
sir
mr
nussbaum
thought
you
know
what
it
meant
reddekop
struck
a
match
off
the
side
of
the
organist
pit
lighted
a
pipe
then
tossed
the
match
carelessly
into
the
theatre
seats
i
winced
and
he
chuckled
not
to
worry
kid
the
place
wo
burn
down
for
a
few
years
yet
i
have
it
on
the
very
best
authority
now
nussbaum
says
october
what
else
does
he
say
he
said
that
you
take
care
of
me
he
gripped
the
pipe
in
his
yellow
teeth
and
hissed
a
laugh
around
the
stem
he
did
did
he
well
i
suppose
i
should
of
course
i
wo
know
for
sure
for
more
than
years
i
do
suppose
you
want
to
wait
that
long
no
sir
i
said
i
did
like
this
little
man
he
reminded
me
of
some
kind
of
musical
rat
i
thought
not
do
you
know
what
a
trust
is
james
we
covered
that
in
common
law
i
could
rattle
off
about
thirty
different
kinds
without
blinking
i
have
a
general
idea
i
said
good
good
what
i
thinking
is
the
best
thing
is
for
me
to
set
up
a
trust
through

filthy
that

a
notice

you
reddekop
knew
i
was
a
stranger
in
town
and
maybe
he
was
counting
on
my
not
being
able
to
find
anyone
qualified
to
audit
the
trust
but
i
had
an
ace
up
my
sleeve
i
was
anybody
fool
that
sounds
fair
i
said
back
at
my
mama
i
had
long
hard
days
doing
chores
chopping
wood
stacking
hay
weeding
the
garden
carrying
water
i
go
to
bed
limp
as
a
rag
and
as
exhausted
as
i
thought
i
could
be
boy
was
i
wrong
by
the
time
i
found
mr
adelson
rooming
house
i
could
barely
stand
my
mouth
was
dry
as
a
and
it
was
hard
to
keep
my
eyes
open
they
got
hills
in
san
francisco
that
must
been
some
kind
of
joke
god
played
his
landlady
a
grey
woman
whose
sour
expression
seemed
directed
at
everything
and
anything
let
me
in
and
pointed
me
up
three
rickety
flights
of
stairs
to
mr
adelson
room
i
dragged
my
luggage
up
with
me
bumping
it
on
the
stairs
and
rapped
on
the
door
mr
adelson
answered
in
the
same
shirtsleeves
and
suspenders
i
seen
him
in
that
christmas
an
age
ago
when
my
mama
dragged
me
to
his
cottage
james
he
said
mr
adelson
i
said
sorry
to
drop
in
like
this
he
took
my
bag
from
me
and
ushered
me
into
his
room
pulling
up
a
chair
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
here
he
said
do
your
parents
know
where
you
are
are
you
all
right
have
you
eaten
are
you
hungry
i
pretty
hungry
i
have
eaten
since
supper
last
night
on
the
train
i
tried
to
make
it
sound
jaunty
but
i
afraid
it
came
out
pretty
i
fix
us
sandwiches
he
said
and
started
fishing
around
his
i
watched
his
shoulders
move
for
a
moment
and
then
my
eyes
closed
well
good
morning
mr
adelson
said
as
i
sat
bolt
upright
disoriented
in
a
strange
bed
with
a
strange
blanket
coffee
he
was
leaning
over
a
little
sterno
stove
heating
up
a
small
tin
pot
morning
sun
streamed
in
through
the
grimy
window
i
wrapped
your
sandwich
up
from
last
night
it
there
on
the
dresser
i
stood
up
and
saw
that
except
for
my
shoes
i
was
still
dressed
the
sandwich
was
salt
beef
and
cheese
and
the
sourdough
was
stale
and
it
was
the
best
thing
i
ever
eaten
mr
adelson
handed
me
a
tin
cup
full
of
strong
coffee
and
though
i
do
much
like
coffee
i
found
myself
drinking
it
as
fast
as
i
could
thank
you
mr
adelson
i
said
robert
he
said
and
sat
down
on
the
room
only
chair
i
perched
on
the
end
well
you
seem
to
have
had
quite
a
day
let
hear
about
it
i
told
him
as
much
as
i
could
fudging
around
some
of
the
details
my
mama
surely
did
know
where
i
was
even
if
she
was
very
happy
about
it
and
of
course
i
could
tell
him
that
i
met
nussbaum
in
so
i
just
moved
the
locale
to
france
and
caged
around
what
message
he
asked
me
to
deliver
to
reddekop
it
still
made
for
a
pretty
exciting
telling
so
you
want
me
to
go
to
this
lawyer
office
with
you
to
look
over
the
papers
james
i
just
a
sailor
i
not
qualified
i
prepared
for
this
argument
on
the
long
slog
to
the
rooming
house
but
know
something
about
this
they
wo
believe
it
though
and
will
slip
all
kinds
of
dirty
tricks
in
if
they
think
that
the
only
fellow
who
be
looking
at
it
is
just
a
kid
explain
to
me
again
why
you
do
want
to
wire
mr
johnstone
to
come
and
look
it
over
it
sounds
like
an
awful
lot
of
money
for
him
not
to
be
involved
he
not
my
pa
robert
i
do
even
him
and
chances
are
he
hide
away
all
that
money
until
i
eighteen
or
and
try
to
send
me
off
to
school
and
what
wrong
with
that
you
have
other
plans
sure
i
said
too
loudly
i
had
really
worked
that
part
out
i
just
knew
that
the
next
time
i
set
foot
in
new
jerusalem
i
be
my
own
man
a
man
of
the
world
and
not
dependent
on
anyone
i
take
mama
and
mr
johnstone
out
for
a
big
supper
and
stay
in
the
fanciest
room
at
the
stableman
hotel
and
hire
tommy
benson
to
carry
my
bags
to
my
room
besides
i
not
asking
you
to
do
this
for
i
pay
you
a
an
administrative
fee
five
percent
he
looked
serious
james
if
i
do
this
mind
i
said
i
wo
take
a
red
cent
there
are
things
here
that
you
not
telling
me
now
that
your
business
but
i
want
to
make
sure
that
if
anyone
ever
scrutinises
the
affair
that
it
clear
that
i
did
receive
any
benefit
from
it
i
smiled
i
knew
i
had
him
if
he
thought
it
that
far
through
he
going
to
say
no
besides
i
had
even
played
my
trump
card
yet
that
if
he
did
help
me
i
be
out
on
the
streets
on
my
own
and
i
could
tell
that
he
did
like
that
idea
mr
adelson
wore
his
teacher
clothes
for
the
affair
and
i
wore
the
good
breeches
and
shirt
i
packed
we
stopped
at
a
barber
before
mr
adelson
treated
me
to
a
haircut
from
the
man
while
he
took
a
shave
and
a
trim
we
boarded
the
cablecar
to
market
like
a
couple
of
proper
gentlemen
and
if
i
thought
flying
in
a
jetpack
was
exciting
it
was
nothing
compared
to
the
terror
of
hanging
on
the
of
a
cablecar
as
it
laboured
up
and
then
quickly
down
a
monster
hill
the
lawyer
was
a
foreigner
a
frenchie
or
a
belgian
and
his
offices
were
grubby
and
filled
with
stinking
cigar
smoke
and
the
din
of
the
trolleys
he
asked
no
embarrassing
questions
of
me
he
just
sized
up
mr
adelson
then
put
away
the
papers
on
his
desk
and
presented
a
set
from
his
briefcase
laying
out
the
terms
of
the
trust
and
retreated
from
the
office
i
read
over
mr
adelson
shoulder
the
terms
scribbled
in
a
hasty
hand
but
every
word
of
it
legal
and
binding
near
as
i
could
tell
the
amounts
in
question
were
staggering
two
hundred
dollars
every
month
indexed
for
inflation
for
seventy
years
or
the
duration
of
my
natural
life
whichever
was
lesser
the
records
of
the
trust
to
be
deposited
with
the
wells
fargo
subject
to
scrutiny
on
demand
mr
adelson
looked
long
and
hard
at
me
james
i
ca
begin
to
imagine
what
sort
of
information
you
traded
for
this
but
son
you
rich
as
croesus
yes
sir
i
said
do
these
papers
look
legal
to
you
yes
sir
they
seem
legal
to
me
too
a
bubble
of
excitement
filled
my
chest
and
i
had
to
restrain
myself
from
bouncing
on
my
heels
i
going
to
sign
it
i
said
will
you
witness
it
i
got
a
better
idea
let
get
that
lawyer
and
take
this
down
to
the
wells
fargo
and
have
the
president
of
the
bank
witness
it
himself
and
that
just
what
we
did
mr
adelson
had
spent
the
previous
night
on
the
floor
while
i
slept
in
his
bed
my
first
month
payment
was
tucked
carefully
in
my
pocket
and
over
his
protests
i
pried
loose
a
few
bills
and
took
my
own
room
in
the
rooming
house
and
then
the
two
of
us
ate
out
at
a
restaurant
whose
prices
had
seemed
impossibly
the
day
before
we
had
oysters
and
steaks
and
i
had
a
slab
of
apple
pie
for
desert
with
fresh
ice
cream
and
peach
syrup
and
when
i
was
done
i
felt
like
new
man
mr
adelson
had
a
bottle
of
beer
with
dinner
and
a
whiskey
afterwards
and
i
insisted
on
paying
well
then
he
said
sipping
his
whiskey
you
a
very
young
man
what
will
you
do
now
all
throughout
my
scheming
since
my
second
return
from
the
prospect
of
what
to
do
with
all
the
money
had
niggled
away
at
the
back
of
my
mind
all
i
knew
for
sure
was
that
i
did
want
to
grow
up
in
new
jerusalem
i
wanted
adventure
exotic
places
and
people
danger
and
excitement
over
dinner
though
a
plan
had
been
forming
in
my
head
does
the
need
a
he
shook
his
head
and
smiled
at
me
i
was
afraid
it
was
something
like
that
son
you
could
pay
for
a
stateroom
on
a
proper
liner
with
all
the
money
you
have
why
would
you
want
to
be
in
charge
of
on
a
leaky
old
tub
why
do
you
want
to
sail
off
on
a
leaky
old
tub
instead
of
teaching
in
utah
or
working
on
the
trolleys
here
it
took
me
most
of
the
night
to
convince
him
but
there
was
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
i
would
and
when
the
ship
sailed
that
i
be
on
it
