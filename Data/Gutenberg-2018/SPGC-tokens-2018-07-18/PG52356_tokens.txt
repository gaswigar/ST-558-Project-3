the
name
of
giacomo
leopardi
is
not
yet
a
household
word
in
the
mouths
of
englishmen
few
of
us
have
heard
of
him
still
fewer
have
read
any
of
his
writings
if
known
at
all
he
is
probably
coupled
in
a
manner
with
other
foreign
representatives
of
a
phase
of
poetic
thought
the
influence
of
which
has
passed
its
zenith
as
a
contemporary
of
byron
leopardi
is
perhaps
credited
with
a
certain
amount
of
psychological
plagiarism
and
possibly
disregarded
as
a
mere
satellite
of
the
greater
planet
but
if
this
be
so
it
is
unjust
his
fame
is
his
own
and
time
makes
his
isolation
and
grand
individuality
more
and
more
prominent
what
byron
and
shelley
millevoye
baudelaire
and
gautier
heine
and
platen
pouchkine
and
lermontoff
are
to
england
france
germany
and
russia
respectively
leopardi
is
in
a
measure
to
italy
but
he
is
more
than
this
the
jewel
of
his
renown
is
philology
poetry
and
philosophy
were
each
in
turn
cultivated
by
him
and
he
was
of
too
brilliant
an
intellect
not
to
excel
in
them
all
as
a
philologist
he
astonished
niebuhr
and
delighted
creuzer
as
a
poet
he
has
been
compared
with
dante
as
a
philosopher
he
takes
high
rank
among
the
greatest
and
most
original
men
of
modern
times
one
of
his
biographers
dovari
studio
di
leopardi
ancona
has
termed
him
the
greatest
philosopher
poet
and
of
the
nineteenth
century
though
such
eulogy
may
be
and
doubtless
is
excessive
the
fact
that
it
has
been
given
testifies
to
the
extraordinary
nature
of
the
man
who
is
its
subject
in
germany
and
france
leopardi
is
perhaps
as
well
known
and
highly
appreciated
as
in
italy
his
poems
have
been
translated
into
the
languages
of
those
countries
and
in
france
within
the
last
year
two
more
or
less
complete
versions
of
his
prose
writings
have
appeared
biographies
reviews
and
lighter
notices
of
the
celebrated
italian
are
of
repeated
and
increasing
occurrence
on
the
continent
england
however
knows
little
of
him
and
hitherto
none
of
his
writings
have
been
made
accessible
to
the
english
reading
public
the
following
brief
outline
of
his
life
may
in
part
help
to
explain
the
peculiarly
sombre
philosophical
views
which
he
held
and
of
which
his
works
are
chiefly
an
elaboration
giacomo
leopardi
was
born
at
recanati
a
small
town
about
fifteen
miles
from
ancona
on
the
june
he
was
of
noble
birth
equally
on
the
side
of
his
father
and
mother
provided
with
a
tutor
at
an
early
age
he
soon
left
him
far
behind
in
knowledge
and
when
only
eight
years
old
he
discarded
the
greek
grammar
he
had
hitherto
used
and
deliberately
set
himself
the
task
of
reading
in
chronological
order
the
greek
authors
of
his
father
library
it
was
due
to
his
own
industry
and
his
father
care
that
later
he
acquired
a
perfect
acquaintance
with
classical
literature
in
he
received
his
first
tonsure
in
token
of
his
dedication
to
the
church
but
this
early
promise
was
not
destined
to
be
fulfilled
before
he
was
eighteen
years
of
age
leopardi
had
attained
recognised
distinction
for
the
amount
and
matter
of
his
erudition
the
mere
catalogue
of
his
writings
chiefly
philological
by
that
time
is
of
sufficient
length
to
excite
wonder
and
their
nature
is
still
more
surprising
latin
commentaries
and
classical
annotations
were
apparently
child
play
to
him
writing
in
to
the
roman
scholar
cancellieri
who
had
noticed
one
of
these
classical
productions
leopardi
says
i
see
myself
secured
to
posterity
in
your
writings
commerce
with
the
learned
is
not
only
useful
but
necessary
for
me
he
was
only
seventeen
when
he
completed
a
task
which
represented
the
sum
of
all
his
early
study
this
was
an
essay
on
the
popular
errors
of
the
ancients
of
considerable
length
first
published
posthumously
in
the
course
of
which
he
cites
more
than
four
hundred
authors
ancient
and
modern
a
single
extract
will
suffice
to
show
that
his
youthful
powers
of
expression
were
as
precocious
as
his
learning
though
his
judgment
was
doubtless
at
fault
he
thus
reviews
the
wisdom
of
the
greeks
the
philosophy
of
the
ancients
was
the
science
of
differences
and
their
academies
were
the
seats
of
confusion
and
disorder
aristotle
condemned
what
plato
had
taught
socrates
mocked
antisthenes
and
zeno
scandalised
epicurus
pythagoreans
platonians
peripatetics
stoics
cynics
epicureans
sceptics
cyrenaics
megarics
eclectics
scuffled
with
and
ridiculed
one
another
while
the
truly
wise
laughed
at
them
all
the
people
left
to
themselves
during
this
hubbub
were
not
idle
but
laboured
silently
to
increase
the
vast
mound
of
human
errors
he
ends
this
essay
with
a
eulogy
of
the
christian
religion
to
live
in
the
true
church
is
the
only
way
to
combat
superstition
shortly
afterwards
increasing
knowledge
which
goethe
has
called
the
antipodes
of
faith
enabled
him
to
perceive
that
roman
catholicism
the
antidote
which
he
then
prescribed
for
superstition
was
itself
full
charged
with
the
poison
he
sought
to
destroy
in
leopardi
made
acquaintance
by
letter
with
pietro
giordani
one
of
the
leading
literary
men
of
the
day
and
a
man
of
varied
experience
and
knowledge
in
his
first
letter
leopardi
opens
his
heart
to
his
new
friend
i
have
very
greatly
perhaps
immoderately
yearned
for
glory
i
burn
with
love
for
italy
and
thank
heaven
that
i
am
an
italian
if
i
live
i
will
live
for
literature
for
aught
else
i
would
not
live
if
i
could
march
a
month
later
from
the
same
source
we
are
able
to
discern
traces
of
that
characteristic
of
leopardi
temperament
which
by
certain
critics
is
thought
to
explain
his
philosophy
writing
to
giordani
he
expatiates
on
the
discomforts
of
recanati
and
its
climate
and
proceeds
added
to
all
this
is
the
obstinate
black
and
barbarous
melancholy
which
devours
and
destroys
me
which
is
nourished
by
study
and
yet
increases
when
i
forego
study
i
have
in
past
times
had
much
experience
of
that
sweet
sadness
which
generates
fine
sentiments
and
which
better
than
joy
may
be
said
to
resemble
the
twilight
but
my
condition
now
is
like
an
eternal
and
horrible
night
a
poison
saps
my
powers
of
body
and
mind
in
the
same
letter
he
gives
his
opinion
on
the
relative
nature
of
prose
and
poetry
poetry
requires
infinite
study
and
application
and
its
art
is
so
profound
that
the
more
you
advance
in
proficiency
so
much
the
further
does
perfection
seem
to
recede
to
be
a
good
prose
writer
first
and
a
poet
later
seems
to
me
to
be
contrary
to
nature
which
first
creates
the
poet
and
then
by
the
cooling
operation
of
age
concedes
the
maturity
and
tranquillity
necessary
for
prose
april
the
correspondence
between
leopardi
and
giordani
lasted
for
five
years
and
it
is
from
their
published
letters
that
we
are
able
to
form
the
best
possible
estimate
of
leopardi
character
and
aspirations
his
own
letters
serve
as
the
index
of
his
physical
and
mental
state
in
them
we
trace
the
gradual
failure
of
his
health
the
growth
of
sombreness
in
his
disposition
and
the
change
which
his
religious
convictions
underwent
during
his
twentieth
year
he
suffered
severely
in
mind
and
body
forced
to
lay
aside
his
studies
he
was
constantly
a
prey
to
ennui
with
all
its
attendant
discomforts
he
thus
writes
to
giordani
of
his
condition
in
august
my
makes
me
unhappy
because
i
am
not
a
philosopher
who
is
careless
of
life
and
because
i
am
compelled
to
stand
aloof
from
my
beloved
studies
another
thing
that
makes
me
unhappy
is
thought
i
believe
you
know
but
i
hope
you
have
not
experienced
how
thought
can
crucify
and
martyrise
any
one
who
thinks
somewhat
differently
from
others
i
have
for
a
long
time
suffered
such
torments
simply
because
thought
has
always
had
me
entirely
in
its
power
and
it
will
kill
me
unless
i
change
my
condition
solitude
is
not
made
for
those
who
burn
and
are
consumed
in
themselves
august
his
mental
activity
was
numbed
by
his
physical
incapacity
the
two
combined
reduced
him
to
a
state
of
despair
there
is
a
noble
fortitude
in
the
following
words
of
another
letter
addressed
to
giordani
i
have
for
a
long
time
firmly
believed
that
i
must
die
within
two
or
three
years
because
i
have
so
ruined
myself
by
seven
years
of
immoderate
and
incessant
study
i
am
conscious
that
my
life
can
not
be
other
than
unhappy
yet
i
am
not
frightened
and
if
i
could
in
any
way
be
useful
i
would
endeavour
to
bear
my
condition
without
losing
heart
i
have
passed
years
so
full
of
bitterness
that
it
seems
impossible
for
worse
to
succeed
them
nevertheless
i
will
not
despair
even
if
my
sufferings
do
increase
i
am
born
for
endurance
march
leopardi
was
now
of
age
and
at
the
time
of
life
when
mans
aspirations
are
keenest
he
had
repeatedly
tried
to
induce
his
father
to
let
him
go
forth
into
the
world
and
take
his
place
in
the
school
of
intellect
but
all
his
endeavours
were
in
vain
though
seconded
by
giordani
who
some
months
before
had
become
personally
acquainted
with
his
young
correspondent
during
a
visit
of
a
few
days
to
casa
leopardi
the
count
was
resolute
in
refusing
to
grant
his
son
permission
to
leave
recanati
giacomo
driven
to
desperation
conceived
a
plan
by
which
he
hoped
to
fulfil
his
desire
in
spite
of
the
paternal
prohibition
the
following
extract
from
the
count
diary
furnishes
the
gist
of
the
matter
and
also
gives
us
some
small
insight
into
his
own
character
giacomo
wishing
to
leave
the
country
and
seeing
that
i
was
opposed
to
his
doing
so
thought
to
obtain
my
consent
by
a
trick
he
requested
count
broglio
to
procure
a
passport
for
milan
so
that
i
might
be
alarmed
on
hearing
of
it
and
thus
let
him
go
i
knew
about
it
because
solari
wrote
unwittingly
to
antici
wishing
giacomo
a
pleasant
journey
i
immediately
asked
broglio
to
send
me
the
passport
which
he
did
with
an
accompanying
letter
i
showed
all
to
my
son
and
deposited
the
passport
in
an
open
cupboard
telling
him
he
could
take
it
at
his
leisure
so
all
ended
thus
the
plot
failed
and
giacomo
was
constrained
to
resign
himself
as
best
he
could
to
a
continuance
of
the
life
worse
than
death
which
he
lived
in
recanati
two
letters
written
in
anticipation
of
the
success
of
his
scheme
one
to
his
father
and
the
other
to
carlo
his
brother
are
of
most
painful
interest
they
suggest
unfilial
conduct
on
his
part
and
unfatherly
treatment
of
his
son
on
the
part
of
count
monaldo
i
am
weary
of
prudence
he
writes
in
the
letter
to
carlo
which
serves
only
as
a
clog
to
the
enjoyment
of
youth
how
thankful
i
should
be
if
the
step
i
am
taking
might
act
as
a
warning
to
our
parents
as
far
as
you
and
our
brothers
are
concerned
i
heartily
trust
you
will
be
less
unhappy
than
myself
i
care
little
for
the
opinion
of
the
world
nevertheless
exonerate
me
if
you
have
any
opportunity
of
doing
so
what
am
i
a
mere
creature
i
realise
this
most
intensely
and
the
knowledge
of
it
has
determined
me
to
take
this
step
to
escape
the
which
so
disgusts
me
so
long
as
i
possessed
i
was
prudent
but
now
that
i
despise
myself
i
can
only
find
relief
by
casting
myself
on
fortune
and
seeking
dangers
worthless
thing
that
i
am
it
were
better
humanly
speaking
for
my
parents
and
myself
that
i
had
never
been
born
or
had
died
ere
now
farewell
dear
brother
the
letter
to
his
father
is
in
a
different
key
it
is
stern
and
severe
and
contains
reproofs
direct
and
inferential
for
his
apparent
indifference
to
his
sons
future
prospects
giacomo
upbraids
him
with
intentional
blindness
to
the
necessities
of
his
position
as
a
youth
of
generally
acknowledged
ability
for
whom
recanati
could
offer
no
scope
or
chance
of
renown
he
goes
on
to
say
now
that
the
law
has
made
me
my
own
master
i
have
determined
to
delay
no
longer
in
taking
my
destiny
on
my
own
shoulders
i
know
that
man
felicity
consists
in
contentment
and
that
i
shall
therefore
have
more
chance
of
happiness
in
begging
my
bread
than
through
whatever
bodily
comforts
i
may
enjoy
here
i
know
that
i
shall
be
deemed
mad
and
i
also
know
that
all
great
men
have
been
so
regarded
and
because
the
career
of
almost
every
great
genius
has
begun
with
despair
i
am
not
disheartened
at
the
same
commencement
in
mine
i
would
rather
be
unhappy
than
insignificant
and
suffer
than
endure
tedium
fathers
usually
have
a
better
opinion
of
their
sons
than
other
people
but
you
on
the
contrary
judge
no
one
so
unfavourably
and
therefore
never
imagined
we
might
be
born
for
greatness
it
has
pleased
heaven
as
a
punishment
to
ordain
that
the
only
youths
of
this
town
with
somewhat
loftier
aspirations
than
the
recanatese
should
belong
to
you
as
a
trial
of
patience
and
that
the
only
father
who
would
regard
such
sons
as
a
misfortune
should
be
ours
the
relationship
between
giacomo
and
his
parents
has
been
a
vexed
question
with
all
his
biographers
who
for
the
most
part
are
of
the
opinion
that
they
had
little
sympathy
with
him
in
the
mental
sufferings
he
underwent
the
count
has
been
called
despota
sistematico
in
the
administration
of
his
household
and
the
most
favourably
disposed
writers
have
agreed
to
regard
him
as
somewhat
of
a
roman
father
but
there
does
not
seem
to
be
sufficient
evidence
to
support
the
theory
that
he
was
intentionally
harsh
and
repressive
to
the
extent
of
cruelty
in
his
treatment
of
his
children
he
was
an
italian
of
the
old
school
and
as
such
his
conduct
was
probably
different
from
that
of
more
modern
italian
fathers
but
that
was
all
in
when
his
whole
being
was
in
a
turmoil
of
disquiet
leopardi
made
his
début
as
a
poet
with
two
odes
the
one
addressed
to
italy
and
the
other
on
the
monument
to
dante
then
recently
erected
in
florence
the
following
literal
translation
of
the
first
stanza
of
the
ode
to
italy
gives
but
a
faint
echo
of
the
original
verse
o
my
country
i
see
the
walls
and
arches
the
columns
the
statues
and
the
deserted
towers
of
our
ancestors
but
their
glory
i
see
not
nor
do
i
see
the
laurel
and
the
iron
which
girt
our
forefathers
unarmed
thou
showest
a
naked
brow
and
naked
breast
alas
how
thou
art
wounded
how
pale
thou
art
and
bleeding
that
i
should
see
thee
thus
o
queen
of
beauty
i
call
on
heaven
and
earth
and
ask
who
thus
has
humbled
thee
and
as
a
crowning
ill
her
arms
are
weighed
with
chains
her
hair
dishevelled
and
unveiled
and
on
the
ground
she
sits
disconsolate
and

these
odes
which
represent
the
first
fruits
of
his
muse
ring
with
enthusiasm
they
are
the
expression
of
a
soul
fired
with
its
own
flame
which
serves
to
illumine
and
vivify
a
theme
then
only
too
real
in
his
country
experience
the
sufferings
of
italy
patriotism
pervades
his
earliest
verse
sadness
and
hopelessness
that
of
later
times
for
these
two
odes
giordani
bestowed
unsparing
eulogy
on
his
young
protégé
before
their
appearance
he
had
begun
to
regard
leopardi
as
the
rising
genius
of
italy
and
had
not
hesitated
to
say
to
him
inveni
hominem
now
however
his
admiration
was
unbounded
he
thus
apostrophised
him
o
nobilissima
e
altissima
e
fortissima
anima
he
referred
to
the
reception
of
his
poems
at
piacenza
in
these
terms
they
speak
of
you
as
a
god
in
leopardi
first
left
home
repeatedly
year
after
year
he
had
besought
his
father
to
permit
him
to
see
something
of
the
world
he
longed
to
associate
with
the
men
who
represented
the
intellect
of
his
country
with
his
own
he
had
little
sympathy
and
they
on
their
part
regarded
him
as
a
phenomenon
eccentric
rather
than
remarkable
they
gave
him
the
titles
of
little
pedant
philosopher
hermit
in
half
ironical
appreciation
of
his
learning
as
he
was
naturally
very
sensitive
these
petty
vexations
became
intensified
to
him
and
were
doubtless
one
of
the
chief
reasons
of
his
unfailing
dislike
for
his
native
place
in
one
of
his
essays
that
of
parini
on
glory
we
discover
a
reference
to
leopardi
life
at
recanati
which
place
is
really
identical
with
the
bosisio
of
the
essay
yet
the
prophet
who
is
not
a
prophet
in
his
own
country
when
living
seldom
fails
of
recognition
after
death
a
statue
is
now
raised
to
leopardi
in
the
place
that
refused
to
honour
him
in
life
the
appreciative
recognition
he
failed
to
attract
in
recanati
he
hoped
to
obtain
at
rome
but
count
monaldo
his
father
long
maintained
his
resistance
to
his
son
wishes
himself
of
a
comparatively
unaspiring
mind
content
with
the
fame
he
could
acquire
in
his
own
province
he
saw
no
necessity
why
his
son
should
be
more
ambitious
probably
also
his
paternal
love
made
him
fearful
of
the
dangers
of
the
world
to
which
his
son
would
be
exposed
of
these
hazards
he
knew
nothing
from
experience
and
they
were
doubtless
magnified
to
him
by
his
imagination
yet
though
naturally
a
man
rather
deficient
in
character
than
otherwise
count
monaldo
was
as
we
have
seen
in
his
own
household
a
stern
not
to
say
unreasonable
disciplinarian
only
after
repeated
solicitations
from
his
son
and
remonstrances
from
his
friends
did
he
give
giacomo
the
desired
permission
chiefly
in
the
hope
that
at
rome
he
might
be
induced
to
enter
the
church
towards
which
he
had
latterly
manifested
some
signs
of
repugnance
the
five
months
spent
by
leopardi
in
rome
sufficed
to
disenchant
him
of
his
ideas
of
the
world
of
life
a
day
or
two
after
his
arrival
he
writes
to
carlo
his
brother
i
do
not
derive
the
least
pleasure
from
the
great
things
i
see
because
i
know
that
they
are
wonderful
without
feeling
that
they
are
so
i
assure
you
their
multitude
and
grandeur
wearied
me
the
first
day
november
again
to
paulina
his
sister
the
world
is
not
beautiful
rather
it
is
insupportable
unless
seen
from
a
distance
ever
prone
to
regard
the
real
through
the
medium
of
the
ideal
he
was
bitterly
disappointed
with
his
first
experience
of
men
the
scholar
whom
he
was
prepared
to
revere
proved
on
acquaintance
to
be
a
blockhead
a
torrent
of
small
talk
the
most
wearisome
and
afflicting
man
on
earth
he
talks
about
the
merest
trifles
with
the
deepest
interest
of
the
greatest
things
with
an
infinite
imperturbability
he
drowns
you
in
compliments
and
exaggerated
praises
and
does
both
in
so
freezing
a
manner
and
with
such
nonchalance
that
to
hear
him
one
would
think
an
extraordinary
man
the
most
ordinary
thing
in
the
world
november
the
stupidest
recanatese
he
termed
wiser
and
more
sensible
than
the
wisest
roman
again
to
his
father
he
complains
of
the
superficiality
of
the
scholars
of
rome
they
all
strive
to
reach
immortality
in
a
coach
as
bad
christians
would
fain
enter
paradise
according
to
them
the
sum
of
human
wisdom
indeed
the
only
true
science
of
man
is
antiquity
hitherto
i
have
not
encountered
a
lettered
eoman
who
understands
the
term
literature
as
meaning
anything
except
archæology
philosophy
ethics
politics
eloquence
poetry
philology
are
unknown
things
in
rome
and
are
regarded
as
childish
playthings
compared
to
the
discovery
of
some
bit
of
copper
or
stone
of
the
time
of
mark
antony
or
agrippa
the
best
of
it
is
that
one
can
not
find
a
single
eoman
who
really
knows
latin
or
greek
without
a
perfect
acquaintance
with
which
languages
it
is
clear
that
antiquity
can
not
be
studied
december
he
was
disheartened
by
the
depraved
condition
of
roman
literature
everywhere
he
saw
merit
disregarded
or
trodden
under
foot
the
city
was
full
of
professional
poets
and
poetesses
and
literary
cliques
formed
for
the
purpose
of
the
of
their
members
illustrious
names
of
the
past
were
insulted
by
the
men
of
the
day
whose
fame
was
founded
on
writings
of
the
most
contemptible
nature
these
circumstances
made
leopardi
confess
in
a
letter
to
his
brother
that
had
he
not
the
harbour
of
posterity
and
the
conviction
that
in
time
all
would
take
its
proper
place
illusory
hope
but
the
only
and
most
necessary
one
for
the
true
scholar
december
he
would
abandon
literature
once
for
all
but
it
was
only
during
moments
of
depression
that
such
words
as
these
escaped
him
he
loved
study
for
its
own
sake
fame
was
after
all
but
a
secondary
consideration
nor
were
men
of
genuine
worth
entirely
wanting
in
rome
niebuhr
then
prussian
ambassador
at
the
papal
court
reinhold
the
dutch
ambassador
mai
subsequently
a
cardinal
were
noble
exceptions
to
the
general
inferiority
by
them
leopardi
was
highly
esteemed
niebuhr
especially
was
profoundly
struck
with
his
genius
i
have
at
last
seen
a
modern
italian
worthy
of
the
old
italians
and
the
ancient
romans
was
his
remark
to
de
bunsen
after
his
first
interview
with
the
young
scholar
both
he
and
de
bunsen
became
firm
friends
with
leopardi
they
endeavoured
their
utmost
to
procure
for
him
some
official
appointment
from
cardinal
consalvi
then
secretary
of
state
and
his
successor
but
owing
to
the
intrigues
prejudices
and
disturbances
of
the
papal
court
they
were
unable
to
effect
anything
on
his
behalf
it
was
an
unfulfilled
intention
of
de
bunsen
later
in
life
to
write
a
memoir
of
leopardi
for
whom
he
always
felt
the
highest
esteem
and
admiration
count
monaldo
wish
that
his
son
should
become
an
ecclesiastic
was
never
realised
leopardi
was
of
too
honest
a
nature
to
profess
what
was
not
in
accordance
with
his
convictions
the
secular
employment
that
he
sought
he
could
not
obtain
so
perforce
he
seems
to
have
turned
his
mind
towards
literary
work
the
drudgery
of
letters
as
distinct
from
the
free
untrammelled
pursuit
of
literature
he
obtained
the
charge
of
cataloguing
the
greek
manuscripts
of
the
barberine
library
and
his
spirits
rose
in
anticipation
of
some
discovery
he
hoped
to
make
which
might
render
him
famous
in
due
time
we
will
astonish
the
world
he
writes
to
his
father
he
was
indeed
successful
in
finding
a
fragment
of
libanius
hitherto
unpublished
but
the
glory
seems
to
have
been
stolen
from
him
since
the
manuscript
was
ushered
forth
to
the
world
by
alien
hands
poor
leopardi
all
his
hopes
seemed
destined
to
be
proved
illusive
it
was
time
for
him
to
leave
a
place
that
could
furnish
him
with
no
other
pleasure
than
that
of
tears
i
visited
tasso
grave
and
wept
there
this
is
the
first
and
only
pleasure
i
have
experienced
in
rome
letter
to
carlo
february
already
he
had
begun
to
steel
himself
to
the
shocks
of
fortune
suffering
and
misfortune
he
could
bear
mental
agony
and
despair
were
too
strong
for
him
in
a
long
letter
to
his
sister
paulina
he
tries
to
impart
to
her
a
little
of
the
philosophy
of
stoicism
which
he
had
taken
to
himself
she
was
distressed
about
the
rupture
of
a
matrimonial
arrangement
contracted
by
the
count
between
her
and
a
certain
roman
gentleman
of
position
and
fortune
leopardi
thus
consoles
her
hope
is
a
very
wild
passion
because
it
necessarily
carries
with
it
very
great
fear
i
assure
you
i
paolina
mia
that
unless
we
can
acquire
a
little
indifference
towards
ourselves
life
is
scarcely
possible
much
less
can
it
be
happy
you
must
resign
yourself
to
fortune
and
not
hope
too
deeply
i
recommend
this
philosophy
to
you
because
i
think
you
resemble
me
in
mind
and
disposition
april
four
years
later
leopardi
confesses
the
insufficiency
of
his
own
remedies
writing
to
puccinotti
in
he
says
i
am
weary
of
life
and
weary
of
the
philosophy
of
indifference
which
is
the
only
cure
for
misfortune
and
ennui
but
which
at
length
becomes
an
ennui
itself
i
look
and
hope
for
nothing
but
death
august
in
may
he
left
rome
and
returned
to
recanati
the
succeeding
ten
years
of
leopardi
life
were
during
his
intervals
of
health
devoted
to
poetry
and
literature
he
had
passed
the
rubicon
of
his
hopes
henceforth
he
studied
to
expound
to
the
world
the
uselessness
of
its
own
anticipations
and
its
essential
unhappiness
his
bodily
infirmities
increased
with
years
his
frame
naturally
weak
suffered
from
the
effects
of
early
his
eyes
and
nerves
were
a
constant
trouble
to
him
to
obtain
what
relief
was
possible
from
change
of
air
and
to
remove
himself
from
recanati
which
he
detested
increasingly
leopardi
went
to
bologna
florence
milan
and
pisa
wintering
now
at
one
place
now
at
another
from
family
reasons
his
father
was
unable
to
supply
him
with
sufficient
money
to
secure
his
independence
consequently
he
was
obliged
to
turn
to
literature
for
a
livelihood
the
publisher
stella
of
milan
willingly
engaged
his
services
and
for
several
years
leopardi
was
in
receipt
of
a
small
but
regular
payment
for
his
literary
labours
he
compiled
chrestomathies
of
italian
prose
and
poetry
and
made
numerous
fragmentary
translations
from
the
classics
a
commentary
on
petrarch
to
which
he
devoted
much
time
and
care
is
in
the
words
of
the
best
possible
guide
through
such
a
charming
labyrinth
as
he
said
of
himself
mediocrity
is
not
for
me
so
in
all
that
he
undertook
the
mark
of
his
genius
appeared
at
florence
leopardi
was
honoured
by
the
representatives
of
italian
literature
and
culture
who
there
formed
a
brilliant
coterie
colletta
was
desirous
of
his
in
the
history
of
naples
with
which
he
was
occupying
the
last
years
of
his
life
the
antologia
and
nuove
ricoglitore
reviews
were
open
to
contributions
from
his
pen
giordani
niccolini
capponi
and
gioberti
amongst
others
welcomed
him
with
open
arms
to
these
his
tuscan
friends
he
dedicated
his
canti
in
with
the
following
touching
letter
my
dear
friends
accept
the
dedication
of
this
book
herein
i
have
striven
as
is
often
done
in
poetry
to
hallow
my
sufferings
this
is
my
farewell
i
can
not
but
weep
in
saying
it
to
literature
and
studies
once
i
hoped
these
dear
resources
would
have
been
the
support
of
my
old
age
pleasures
of
childhood
and
youth
might
vanish
i
thought
and
their
loss
would
be
supportable
if
i
were
thus
cherished
and
strengthened
but
ere
i
was
twenty
years
of
age
my
physical
infirmities
deprived
me
of
half
my
powers
my
life
was
taken
yet
death
was
not
bestowed
on
me
eight
years
later
i
became
totally
incapacitated
this
it
seems
will
be
my
future
state
even
to
read
these
letters
you
know
that
i
make
use
of
other
eyes
than
mine
dear
friends
my
sufferings
are
incapable
of
increase
already
my
misfortune
is
too
great
for
tears
i
have
lost
everything
and
am
but
a
trunk
that
feels
and
suffers
it
is
scarcely
wonderful
that
under
such
circumstances
his
philosophy
should
fail
him
a
code
of
ethics
however
admirable
intrinsically
has
but
cold
consolation
to
offer
to
one
whose
life
is
prolonged
pain
leopardi
at
one
time
allowed
the
idea
of
suicide
to
rest
and
almost
take
root
in
his
mind
he
describes
the
incident
a
great
desire
comes
into
my
mind
to
terminate
once
for
all
these
wretched
years
of
mine
and
to
make
myself
more
completely
motionless
but
he
was
of
a
nature
noble
and
strong
enough
to
resist
such
temptation
he
left
recanati
for
the
last
time
in
the
next
two
years
were
passed
in
florence
rome
and
pisa
whilst
in
rome
leopardi
received
substantial
proof
of
his
fame
in
being
elected
an
academician
of
the
crusca
at
length
the
doctors
recommended
him
to
try
naples
from
the
mild
air
and
general
salubrity
of
which
place
they
anticipated
much
improvement
in
his
condition
thither
he
went
in
company
with
a
young
friend
antonio
ranieri
whose
acquaintance
he
had
made
in
florence
in
the
house
of
ranieri
he
stayed
from
until
his
death
in
tended
by
him
and
his
sister
paulina
his
paulina
as
he
used
to
call
her
with
a
devotedness
and
affection
as
rare
as
it
was
noble
posterity
will
couple
together
the
names
of
ranieri
and
leopardi
as
naturally
as
we
associate
together
those
of
severn
and
keats
all
that
could
be
done
for
the
unfortunate
poet
ranieri
did
his
condition
was
a
singular
one
before
he
left
florence
for
naples
the
doctor
said
of
him
that
his
frame
did
not
possess
sufficient
vitality
to
generate
a
mortal
illness
yet
he
was
seldom
if
ever
free
from
suffering
he
died
on
the
june
as
he
and
his
friend
were
on
the
point
of
setting
out
from
naples
to
a
little
villa
that
ranieri
possessed
on
one
of
the
slopes
of
vesuvius
on
the
night
of
the
he
was
buried
in
the
church
of
vitale
near
the
reputed
grave
of
virgil
his
tomb
is
marked
by
a
stone
erected
at
the
expense
of
ranieri
bearing
the
signs
of
the
cross
and
the
owl
of
minerva
together
with
an
inscription
from
the
pen
of
giordani
the
few
following
lines
from
his
own
verse
would
form
a
suitable
epitaph
for
one
whose
life
was
spent
in
bodily
and
mental
disquietude
o
weary
heart
for
ever
shalt
thou
rest
henceforth
perished
is
the
great
delusion
that
i

nothing
here
is

palpitations
our
life
is
valueless

of
nought

words
might
have
been
an
echo
of
çâkyamuni
utterance
beneath
the
sacred
of
bôdhimanda
when
according
to
the
legend
he
was
in
process
of
transformation
from
man
to
buddha
the
resemblance
is
at
any
rate
a
remarkable
one
in
the
jesuits
made
an
impudent
attempt
to
convince
the
public
that
leopardi
died
repenting
of
his
philosophical
views
and
that
he
had
previously
expressed
a
desire
to
enter
the
society
of

a
long
letter
from
a
certain
francesco
scarpa
to
his
superior
giving
a
number
of
pretended
details
of
leopardi
history
conversion
and
death
appeared
in
a
neapolitan
publication
entitled
science
and
faith
ranieri
came
forward
to
show
the
entire
falsity
of
these
statements
and
to
give
a
more
authoritative
denial
to
them
he
engaged
the
willing
help
of
vicenzo
gioberti
the
latter
in
his
modern
jesuit
contested
their
truth
in
every
respect
he
said
the
story
put
forward
in
this
letter
is
a
tissue
of
lies
and
deliberate
inventions
it
is
sheer
romance
from
beginning
to
end
it
is
thought
by
some
people
that
leopardi
father
was
concerned
in
this
jesuit
manifesto
but
although
the
count
was
doubtless
shocked
beyond
measure
that
his
son
did
not
hold
the
same
beliefs
as
himself
it
is
scarcely
credible
that
he
should
concoct
a
series
of
such
absurdities
as
were
contained
in
scarpa
letter
leopardi
anticipated
that
posterity
and
even
his
contemporaries
would
endeavour
to
explain
the
pessimism
of
his
philosophy
by
his
personal
misfortunes
and
sufferings
accordingly
in
a
letter
to
the
philologist
sinner
he
entered
a
protest
against
such
a
supposition
however
great
my
sufferings
may
have
been
i
do
not
seek
to
diminish
them
by
comforting
myself
with
vain
hopes
and
thoughts
of
a
future
and
unknown
happiness
this
same
courage
of
my
convictions
has
led
me
to
a
philosophy
of
despair
which
i
do
not
hesitate
to
accept
it
is
the
cowardice
of
men
who
would
fain
regard
existence
as
something
very
valuable
that
instigates
them
to
consider
my
philosophical
opinions
as
the
result
of
my
sufferings
and
that
makes
them
persist
in
charging
to
my
material
circumstances
that
which
is
due
to
nothing
but
my
understanding
before
i
die
i
wish
to
make
protest
against
this
imputation
of
weakness
and
trifling
and
i
would
beg
of
my
readers
to
burn
my
writings
rather
than
attribute
them
to
my
sufferings
may
ranieri
thus
describes
leopardi
personal
appearance
he
was
of
middle
height
inclined
to
stoop
and
fragile
his
complexion
was
pale
his
head
was
large
and
his
brow
expansive
his
eyes
were
blue
and
languid
his
nose
was
well
formed
slightly
aquiline
and
his
other
features
were
very
delicately
chiselled
his
voice
was
soft
and
rather
weak
and
he
had
an
ineffable
and
almost
celestial
smile
his
friend
here
scarcely
even
suggests
what
others
have
perhaps
unduly
emphasised
that
is
leopardi
deformity
he
was
slightly
humpbacked
doubtless
the
consequence
of
those
studies
which
simultaneously
ruined
him
and
made
him
famous
it
were
an
omission
not
to
refer
to
the
influence
which
love
exerted
over
leopardi
life
so
strong
was
this
in
the
opinion
of
one
of
his
critics
that
he
even
ascribes
his
philosophy
to
an
infelicissimo
amore
another
writer
says
of
him
that
his
ideal
was
a
woman
ranieri
asserts
that
he
died
unmarried
after
having
twice
felt
the
passion
of
love
as
violently
as
it
was
ever
realised
by
any
man
his
poems
also
testify
how
omnipotent
at
one
time
was
this
sensation
i
recall
to
mind
the
day
when
love
first
assaulted
me
when
i
said
alas
if
this
be
love
how
it
pains
me
the
first
love
again
it
was
morning
the
time
when
a
light
and
sweeter
sleep
presses
our
rested
lids
the
sun
first
grey
light
began
to
gleam
across
the
balcony
through
the
closed
windows
into
my
still
darkened
chamber
then
it
was
that
i
saw
close
by
regarding
me
with
fixed
eyes
the
phantom
form
of
her
who
first
taught
me
to
love
and
left
me
weeping
the
dream
his
poem
to
aspasia
is
a
frank
confession
of
love
and
the
humiliation
he
suffered
in
its
rejection
it
is
a
noble
yet
a
terrible
poem
opening
with
a
description
of
the
scene
that
met
his
eye
as
he
entered
the
room
where
his
charmer
sat
robed
in
the
hue
of
the
melancholy
violet
and
surrounded
by
a
wondrous
luxury
pressing
tender
and
burning
kisses
on
the
round
lipsé
of
her
children
and
displaying
her
snowy
neck
he
saw
as
it
were
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
and
the
lustre
of
a
celestial
light
like
a
divine
ray
o
woman
thy
beauty
dazzled
my
thought
beauty
is
like
such
music
as
seems
to
open
out
to
us
an
unknown
elysium
he
who
loves
is
filled
with
the
ecstasy
of
the
phantom
love
conceived
by
his
imagination
in
the
woman
of
his
love
he
seeks
to
discover
the
beauties
of
his
inspired
vision
in
his
words
and
actions
he
tries
to
recognise
the
personality
of
his
dreams
thus
when
he
strains
her
to
his
bosom
it
is
not
the
woman
but
the
phantom
of
his
dream
that
he
embraces
then
comes
the
awakening
he
vituperates
the
reality
for
not
attaining
to
the
standard
of
his
ideal
rarely
the
woman
nature
is
comparable
with
that
of
the
dream
image
no
thought
like
ours
can
dwell
beneath
those
narrow
brows
vain
is
the
hope
that
man
forges
in
the
fire
of
those
sparkling
eyes
he
errs
in
seeking
profound
and
lofty
thoughts
in
one
who
is
by
nature
inferior
to
man
in
all
things
as
her
members
are
frailer
and
softer
so
is
her
mind
more
feeble
and
confined
he
betrays
his
position
and
gives
the
key
to
his
unjust
censure
of
woman
powers
now
boast
thyself
for
thou
canst
do
so
tell
how
thou
art
the
only
one
of
thy
sex
to
whom
i
have
bent
my
proud
head
and
offered
my
invincible
heart
tell
how
thou
hast
seen
me
with
beseeching
brows
timid
and
trembling
before
thee
i
burn
with
indignation
and
shame
in
the
avowal
watching
thy
every
sign
and
gesture
beside
myself
in
adoration
of
thee
and
changing
expression
and
colour
at
the
slightest
of
thy
looks
the
charm
is
broken
my
yoke
is
on
the
ground
sundered
at
a
single
blow
aspasia
who
were
the
real
objects
of
leopardi
affection
is
not
at
all
clear
certain
village
girls
of
recanati
immortalised
in
his
verse
as
nerina
and
silvia
were
the
inspirers
of
his
first
love
but
his
brother
carlo
bears
witness
to
the
superficial
nature
of
his
affection
in
their
cases
they
merely
served
as
the
awakeners
of
the
sensation
his
own
mind
and
imagination
magnified
it
into
a
passion
true
it
is
that
his
nature
was
one
that
yearned
and
craved
for
love
in
no
ordinary
degree
when
at
rome
isolated
from
his
family
he
wrote
to
carlo
love
me
for
god
sake
i
need
love
love
love
fire
enthusiasm
life
he
addressed
similar
demands
to
giordani
and
others
with
whom
he
was
on
the
most
intimate
terms
indeed
we
are
tempted
to
conjectures
as
to
what
might
have
been
the
fruit
of
leopardi
life
had
he
found
a
helpmate
and
a
consoler
in
his
troubles
a
brief
consideration
of
the
general
nature
of
leopardi
poetry
and
prose
may
not
be
out
of
place
in
this
short
summary
his
poems
are
masterpieces
of
conception
and
execution
their
matter
may
be
open
to
criticism
but
their
manner
is
beyond
praise
his
odes
are
of
the
nobler
kind
full
of
fire
and
vigour
they
reach
the
sublime
where
he
stimulates
his
to
action
and
urges
them
to
aspire
to
a
freedom
happily
now
obtained
his
elegies
breathe
out
an
inspired
sorrow
they
are
the
of
a
mind
filled
with
the
sense
of
the
misery
that
abounds
on
earth
and
unable
though
desirous
to
discern
a
single
ray
of
light
in
the
gloom
of
existence
his
lyrical
pieces
are
the
most
beautiful
and
emotional
of
his
poems
the
following
entitled
the
setting
of
the
moon
though
pervaded
with
the
spirit
of
sadness
that
is
so
predominant
a
characteristic
of
verse
contains
some
charming
imagery
as
in
the
lonely
night
over
the
silvered
fields
and
the
waters
where
the
zephyrs
play
where
the
shades
take
a
thousand
vague
appearances
and
deceitful
forms
amid
the
tranquil
waves
the
foliage
and
the
hedges
the
and
the
villages
the
moon
arrived
at
heaven
boundary
descends
behind
the
alps
and
apennines
into
the
infinite
bosom
of
the
tyrrhenian
sea
whilst
the
world
grows
pale
and
the
shadows
disappear
and
a
mantle
of
darkness
shrouds
the
valley
and
the
hills
night
alone
remains
and
the
carter
singing
on
his
way
salutes
with
a
sad
melody
the
last
reflection
of
that
fleeing
light
which
hitherto
had
led
his
steps
so
vanishes
our
youth
and
leaves
us
solitary
with
life
so
flee
away
the
shadows
which
veiled
illusive
joys
and
so
die
too
the
distant
hopes
on
which
our
mortal
nature
rested
life
is
left
desolate
and
dark
and
the
traveller
trying
to
pierce
the
gloom
looks
here
and
there
but
seeks
in
vain
to
know
the
way
or
what
the
journey
yet
before
him
he
sees
that
all
on
earth
is
strange
and
he
a
stranger
dwelling
there
you
little
hills
and
strands
when
falls
the
light
which
silvers
in
the
west
the
veil
of
night
shall
not
for
long
be
orphaned
on
the
other
side
of
heaven
the
first
grey
light
of
dawn
shall
soon
be
followed
by
the
sun
whose
fiery
rays
shall
flood
you
and
the
ethereal
fields
with
a
luminous
stream
but
mortal
life
when
cherished
youth
has
gone
has
no
new
dawn
nor
ever
gains
new
light
widowed
to
the
end
it
stays
and
on
life
other
shore
made
dark
by
night
the
gods
have
set
the
tomb
dark
seal
in
his
interpretation
of
nature
he
is
literal
but
withal
truly
poetic
he
worships
her
in
the
concrete
but
vituperates
her
in
the
abstract
as
representative
to
him
of
omnipresent
deity
creative
but
also
destructive
the
two
or
three
poems
that
may
be
termed
satirical
are
at
the
same
time
half
elegiac
in
them
he
ridicules
and
censures
the
folly
of
his
contemporaries
and
mourns
over
the
mystery
of
things
to
these
however
there
is
one
exception
the
longest
of
all
his
poems
this
is
known
as
the
continuation
of
the
battle
of
the
frogs
and
mice
it
consists
of
eight
cantos
comprising
about
three
thousand
lines
and
was
first
published
posthumously
the
abruptness
of
its
ending
gives
the
idea
erroneous
or
not
of
incompleteness
leopardi
had
several
years
before
translated
and
versified
batrachomyomachia
and
this
satire
takes
up
the
story
where
homer
ends
it
is
exclusively
a
ridicule
of
the
times
with
especial
reference
to
his
own
country
and
her
national
enemy
austria
in
style
and
treatment
it
has
been
compared
with
byron
don
juan
from
which
however
it
totally
differs
in
its
intrinsic
character
it
abounds
in
beauties
of
description
sentiment
and
expression
and
well
deserves
to
be
considered
his
leopardi
thus
describes
his
method
of
poetic
composition
i
compose
only
when
under
an
inspiration
yielding
to
which
in
two
minutes
i
have
designed
and
organised
the
poem
this
done
i
wait
for
a
recurrence
of
such
inspiration
which
seldom
happens
until
several
weeks
have
elapsed
then
i
set
to
work
at
composition
bub
so
slowly
that
i
can
not
complete
a
poem
however
short
in
less
than
two
or
three
weeks
such
is
my
method
without
inspiration
it
were
easier
to
draw
water
from
a
stone
than
a
single
verse
from
my
brain
leopardi
reputation
was
firmly
established
by
the
appearance
of
his
operette
morali
as
his
prose
writings
were
termed
monti
classed
them
as
the
best
italian
prose
compositions
of
the
century
gioberti
compared
them
to
the
writing
of
machiavelli
giordani
with
his
usual
tendency
to
extravagance
gives
his
friend
the
following
pompous
panegyric
his
style
possesses
the
conciseness
of
speroni
the
grandiloquence
of
tasso
the
smoothness
of
paruta
the
purity
of
gelli
the
wit
of
firenzuola
the
solidity
and
magnificence
of
pallavicino
the
imagination
of

and
the
elegance
of
cicero
leopardi
has
been
aptly
termed
an
aristocrat
in
his
writing
too
much
of
a
reasoner
to
be
very
popular
with
the
masses
who
do
not
care
for
the
exertion
of
sustained
thought
his
logic
is
strikingly
clear
to
the
intelligent
his
periods
are
occasionally
as
long
as
those
of
machiavelli
or
guicciardini
but
their
continuity
and
signification
are
never
obscure
ranieri
bears
witness
to
the
fact
that
his
prose
was
the
fruit
of
very
great
labour
the
subject
and
tendency
of
leopardi
writings
will
be
evident
to
the
reader
of
the
following
dialogues
framed
on
the
model
of
lucian
they
will
compare
favourably
with
the
writings
of
the
greek
satirist
in
subtlety
and
wit
in
spite
of
their
sombre
tone
they
can
not
be
said
to
possess
much
originality
save
in
treatment
the
subjects
discussed
and
even
the
arguments
introduced
are
mostly
old
every
acute
moraliser
since
the
world
began
has
in
more
or
less
degree
commensurate
with
his
ability
debated
within
himself
the
problems
here
considered
facts
beliefs
opinions
theories
may
be
marshalled
to
produce
an
infinite
number
of
diverse
harmonies
but
no
one
such
combination
formed
by
the
mind
of
man
may
be
put
forward
as
the
true
and
ultimate
explanation
of
the
mystery
of
life
leibnitz
with
his
harmony
of
universal
good
is
as
fallible
as
leopardi
or
schopenhauer
with
their
harmonies
of
evil
in
either
case
the
real
is
sacrificed
to
the
ideal
whether
of
good
or
evil
either
from
temperament
or
circumstances
these
philosophers
were
predisposed
to
give
judgment
on
life
favourably
or
adversely
without
duly
considering
the
attributes
of
existence
as
dapples
in
his
french
version
of
leopardi
has
remarked
he
early
withdrew
from
actual
life
life
with
all
those
manifold
sensations
which
he
himself
defines
to
be
the
only
constituents
of
pleasure
in
existence
his
body
proved
little
else
than
the
sensation
of
suffering
all
his
vitality
was
concentrated
in
his
mind
so
that
he
was
scarcely
a
competent
and
impartial
judge
of
the
ordinary
pleasures
and
ills
of
life
he
could
not
be
otherwise
than
prejudiced
by
his
own
experiences
or
rather
lack
of
experiences
yet
though
leopardi
was
physically
incapable
of
many
of
life
pleasures
he
none
the
less
passionately
yearned
for
them
strength
and
desire
struggled
within
him
and
the
former
only
too
frequently
proved
weaker
than
the
latter
thus
he
was
innately
adapted
for
pessimism
we
consider
leopardi
to
have
been
a
man
of
the
grandest
intellectual
powers
capable
originally
of
almost
anything
to
which
the
human
mind
could
attain
but
that
his
reason
later
in
life
became
somewhat
perverted
by
his
sufferings
were
human
life
as
absolutely
miserable
a
thing
as
he
represents
it
to
be
it
would
be
insupportable
that
he
should
so
regard
it
does
not
seem
remarkable
when
we
consider
his
circumstances
he
was
poor
seldom
free
from
pain
and
unsupported
by
a
creed
for
the
sufferings
of
his
life
he
could
see
no
shadow
of
atonement
or
compensation
a
future
state
was
incomprehensible
to
him
he
bestows
much
gratuitous
pity
on
the
human
race
which
we
though
revering
his
genius
may
return
to
him
as
more
deserving
of
it
than
ourselves
his
heart
was
naturally
full
of
the
most
lively
affection
but
he
could
never
sufficiently
satisfy
the
yearnings
of
his
nature
like
ottonieri
whose
portrait
is
his
own
to
a
great
extent
his
instincts
were
noble
like
him
also
he
died
without
effecting
much
in
proportion
to
his
powers
the
conclusions
of
leopardi
philosophy
may
be
thus
summed
up
the
universe
is
an
enigma
totally
insoluble
the
sufferings
of
mankind
exceed
all
good
that
men
experience
estimating
the
latter
in
compensation
for
the
former
progress
or
as
we
call
it
civilisation
instead
of
lightening
man
sufferings
increases
them
since
it
enlarges
his
capacity
for
suffering
without
proportionately
augmenting
his
means
of
enjoyment
how
far
are
these
conclusions
refutable
it
may
be
regarded
as
indubitable
that
the
first
two
can
not
be
refuted
without
the
aid
of
revelation
science
is
incompetent
to
explain
the
why
and
the
wherefore
of
the
universe
it
is
yet
groping
to
discover
the
how
still
less
can
any
satisfactory
explanation
be
given
of
the
purpose
for
which
suffering
exists
unless
we
rely
on
revelation
religion
which
modern
philosophers
somewhat
contemptuously
designate
as
popular
metaphysics
can
alone
afford
an
explanation
of
these
problems
çâkyamuni
nearly
years
ago
asked
what
is
the
cause
of
all
the
miseries
and
sufferings
with
which
man
is
afflicted
he
himself
gave
what
he
considered
to
be
the
correct
answer
existence
and
then
he
traced
existence
to
the
passions
and
desires
innate
in
man
these
last
were
to
be
conquered
in
the
condition
of
insensibility
to
all
material
things
called
nirvana
truly
his
remedy
was
a
radical
one
and
had
he
succeeded
in
procuring
universal
acceptance
for
his
doctrines
the
human
race
would
have
become
extinct
a
few
generations
later
than
his
own
time
but
nirvana
is
unnatural
if
it
be
nothing
else
unnatural
in
itself
and
in
the
steps
that
lead
up
to
it
and
although
it
is
due
to
schopenhauer
and
his
more
or
less
heterodox
disciples
that
this
buddhistic
dogma
is
regarded
theoretically
by
some
people
with
a
certain
amount
of
favour
we
think
the
instincts
of
life
are
strong
enough
within
them
all
to
resist
any
decided
inclination
on
their
part
to
carry
it
into
effect
as
for
the
third
conclusion
it
must
be
admitted
that
susceptibilities
of
suffering
are
enlarged
with
increasing
culture
leopardi
has
shown
us
that
the
more
vividly
we
realise
the
evils
that
surround
and
affect
us
so
much
the
more
keenly
do
they
arouse
in
us
sensations
of
pain
knowledge
of
them
makes
us
suffer
from
them
the
bliss
of
ignorance
is
rudely
dispelled
by
the
cold
hand
of
science
but
must
this
necessarily
continue
may
not
the
same
progress
which
exposes
the
wound
find
the
salve
to
heal
it
we
trust
and
think
so
in
spite
of
all
assertions
to
the
contrary
there
is
nothing
in
the
near
future
of
humanity
that
need
alarm
us
men
will
not
work
less
because
they
think
more
nor
is
there
any
sufficient
reason
to
show
that
increasing
knowledge
must
represent
increasing
sorrow
as
johnson
has
said
the
cure
for
the
greatest
part
of
human
miseries
is
not
radical
but
palliative
for
the
material
means
of
palliation
we
look
to
science
we
hope
and
think
that
there
is
good
to
be
gained
from
these
writings
of
leopardi
in
spite
of
the
tone
of
despair
that
rings
throughout
them
his
theory
of
the
infelicità
of
things
cheerless
though
it
be
often
suggests
ideas
sublime
in
themselves
and
noble
in
their
effect
and
the
very
essence
of
his
philosophy
resolves
itself
into
a
recommendation
to
act
rather
than
by
contemplation
to
lose
the
power
of
action
for
as
he
says
a
life
must
be
active
and
vigorous
else
it
is
not
true
life
and
death
is
preferable
to
it
a
brief
reference
to
the
most
recent
publications
on
leopardi
may
be
interesting
as
tending
to
throw
light
on
his
domestic
relationships
and
as
giving
us
an
idea
of
his
own
habits
in
private
life
antonio
ranieri
now
in
his
year
in
a
book
published
at
naples
in
gives
many
interesting
details
of
the
poet
life
he
first
met
him
at
florence
and
was
touched
with
compassion
for
his
unfortunate
state
ill
and
helpless
he
was
incapable
of
doing
anything
but
weep
in
despair
at
the
thought
of
being
obliged
to
return
to
his
native
place
recanati
and
death
are
to
me
one
and
the
same
thing
he
exclaimed
through
his
tears
ranieri
in
a
generous
moment
replied
leopardi
you
shall
not
return
to
recanati
the
little
that
i
possess
is
enough
for
two
as
a
benefit
to
me
not
to
yourself
we
will
henceforth
live
together
this
was
the
beginning
of
what
ranieri
calls
his
vita
nuova
he
conducted
leopardi
from
florence
to
rome
thence
back
to
florence
and
finally
from
florence
to
naples
the
doctors
everywhere
shrugged
their
shoulders
at
his
case
and
suggested
as
delicately
as
possible
the
mortal
nature
of
his
maladies
at
naples
ranieri
and
his
sister
paulina
did
all
they
could
for
leopardi
and
from
to
his
death
in
supplied
all
his
wants
he
could
seldom
see
to
read
or
write
we
used
to
read
to
him
constantly
and
regularly
and
were
fortunately
conversant
with
the
languages
he
knew
says
ranieri
occasionally
he
was
able
to
go
to
the
theatre
and
enjoyed
it
greatly
in
his
habits
he
seems
to
have
tried
his
friend
temper
and
patience
considerably
he
was
wont
to
turn
night
into
day
and
day
into
night
ranieri
and
his
sister
often
did
the
same
in
order
to
read
work
and
talk
with
him
he
breakfasted
between
three
and
five
in
the
afternoon
and
dined
about
midnight
like
schopenhauer
he
delighted
in
conversation
which
he
termed
one
of
the
greatest
pleasures
of
life
he
was
very
obstinate
in
personal
matters
disobeying
the
doctors
in
his
diet
and
everything
else
his
fondness
for
his
old
clothes
was
remarkable
he
loved
them
for
their
associations
ranieri
mentions
a
certain
very
ancient
overcoat
which
for
seven
years
had
tormented
him
and
which
he
used
to
entreat
leopardi
to
lay
aside
but
which
he
clung
to
with
an
incredible
affection
preferring
it
to
a
new
one
that
he
allowed
the
moths
to
destroy
the
mere
names
of
wind
cold
and
snow
were
enough
to
pale
him
he
could
not
bear
fire
and
formerly
used
to
pass
the
winters
three
parts
submerged
in
a
sack
of
feathers
reading
and
writing
thus
the
greater
part
of
the
day
he
was
very
terrified
when
the
cholera
appeared
at
naples
to
avoid
which
he
and
ranieri
went
to
a
country
house
of
the
latter
on
one
of
the
slopes
of
vesuvius
here
leopardi
wrote
his
poem
la
ginestra
inspired
by
the
desolate
scenes
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
he
died
suddenly
at
naples
as
he
and
household
were
about
to
set
off
again
for
the
country
the
neapolitan
journal
il
progresso
in
an
article
on
lis
death
remarked
of
him
that
such
brilliancy
is
not
allowed
to
illumine
the
earth
for
long

this
is
a
book
of
considerable
value
written
by
the
widow
of

giacomo
younger
brother
and
his

self
it
is
most
valuable
as
delineating
the
characters
of
leopardi
father
and
mother
a
softer
light
is
shed
on
the
character
of
leopardi
mother
we
learn
that
she
was
not
passionless
hard
and
unsympathetic
as
we
had
previously
supposed
her
to
be
on
the
contrary
she
was
a
good
woman
of
deep
affection
who
made
it
the
aim
of
her
married
life
to
work
for
the
welfare
of
the
family
of
which
she
became
a
member
weighted
with
debt
almost
to
the
point
of
exhaustion
the
estates
of
casa
leopardi
needed
a
skilful
and
vigorous
administrator
if
they
were
to
continue
in
the
hands
of
their
old
owners
count
monaldo
leopardi
was
not
such
an
administrator
he
was
a
man
devoted
tout
entier
à
science
and
occupying
himself
more
with
bibliology
and
archæology
than
with
the
finances
of
his
estate
the
jews
of
perousa
milan
and
the
march
towns
would
sooner
or
later
have
tightened
their
hold
on
the
leopardi
patrimony
to
such
a
degree
that
the
ancient
family
could
only
have
continued
to
exist
as
proprietors
on
sufferance
but
in
the
words
of

authoress

reins
of

neglected
administration
and
set
herself
the
task
of
restoring
the
fortunes
of

by
her
exertions
the

was
made
acquainted
with
their
difficulties
and
by
his
intervention
an
arrangement
was
made
between

whereby
the

were

by

leopardi

a
study
by
villari
november
of
the
human
it
is
said
that
the
first
inhabitants
of
the
earth
were
everywhere
created
simultaneously
whilst
children
they
were
fed
by
bees
goats
and
doves
as
the
poets
say
the
infant
jove
was
nourished
the
earth
was
much
smaller
than
it
is
at
present
and
devoid
of
mountains
and
hills
the
sky
was
starless
there
was
no
sea
and
the
world
as
a
whole
was
far
less
varied
and
beautiful
than
it
now
is
yet
men
were
never
weary
of
looking
at
the
sky
and
the
earth
which
excited
within
them
feelings
of
wonder
and
admiration
they
considered
them
both
to
be
of
infinite
extent
majesty
and
magnificence
their
souls
were
filled
with
joyous
hopes
and
every
sensation
of
life
gave
them
inexpressible
pleasure
their
contentment
daily
increased
so
that
they
at
length
thought
themselves
supremely
happy
in
this
peaceful
state
of
mind
they
passed
their
infancy
and
youth
arrived
at
a
mature
age
their
feelings
began
to
experience
some
alteration
as
their
early
hopes
to
which
they
had
perseveringly
adhered
failed
of
realisation
they
no
longer
put
faith
in
them
but
on
the
other
hand
present
happiness
isolated
from
anticipation
of
the
future
did
not
suffice
them
especially
seeing
that
either
from
habit
or
because
the
charm
of
a
first
acquaintanceship
had
worn
off
nature
and
all
the
incidents
of
life
gave
them
much
less
pleasure
than
at
first
they
travelled
over
the
earth
and
visited
the
most
distant
lands
this
they
could
easily
do
because
there
were
neither
seas
mountains
nor
obstacles
of
any
kind
to
oppose
them
after
a
few
years
most
men
had
proved
the
finite
nature
of
the
earth
the
boundaries
of
which
were
by
no
means
so
remote
as
to
be
unattainable
they
found
too
that
all
countries
of
the
world
and
all
men
with
but
slight
differences
were
alike
these
discoveries
i
so
greatly
increased
their
discontent
that
a
weariness
of
life
became
prevalent
among
men
even
before
they
had
passed
the
threshold
of
manhood
and
as
men
grew
older
this
feeling
gradually
transformed
itself
into
a
hatred
of
existence
so
that
at
length
seized
by
despair
they
in
one
way
or
another
hesitated
not
to
abandon
the
light
and
life
once
so
beloved
it
seemed
to
the
gods
a
shocking
thing
that
living
creatures
should
prefer
death
to
life
and
should
destroy
themselves
for
no
other
reason
than
that
they
were
weary
of
existence
it
also
amazed
them
beyond
measure
to
find
their
gifts
held
in
such
contempt
and
so
unequivocally
rejected
by
men
they
thought
the
world
had
been
endowed
with
sufficient
beauty
goodness
and
harmony
to
make
it
not
merely
a
bearable
but
even
a
highly
enjoyable
place
of
residence
for
every
living
thing
and
especially
for
man
whom
they
had
fabricated
with
peculiar
care
and
a
marvellous
perfection
at
the
same
time
touched
with
a
deep
feeling
of
compassion
for
the
distress
men
exhibited
they
began
to
fear
lest
the
renewal
and
increase
of
these
deplorable
actions
might
not
soon
result
in
the
extinction
of
the
human
race
contrary
to
destiny
and
they
would
thus
lose
the
most
perfect
work
of
their
creation
and
be
deprived
of
the
honours
they
received
from
men
jove
determined
therefore
to
improve
the
condition
of
men
since
it
seemed
necessary
and
to
increase
the
means
whereby
they
might
obtain
happiness
they
complained
of
the
deceitfulness
of
things
which
were
neither
as
great
beautiful
perfect
nor
varied
as
they
at
first
imagined
them
to
be
but
were
on
the
contrary
small
imperfect
and
monotonous
they
derived
no
pleasure
from
their
youth
still
less
were
they
satisfied
with
the
times
of
maturity
and
old
age
their
infancy
alone
gave
them
pleasure
and
yearning
for
the
sweetness
of
their
early
days
they
besought
jove
to
make
their
condition
one
of
perpetual
childhood
but
the
god
could
not
satisfy
them
in
this
matter
for
it
was
contrary
to
the
laws
of
nature
and
the
divine
decrees
and
intentions
neither
could
he
communicate
his
own
infinity
to
mortal
creatures
nor
the
world
itself
any
more
than
he
could
bestow
infinite
happiness
and
perfection
on
men
and
things
it
seemed
best
to
him
to
extend
the
limits
of
creation
at
the
same
time
increasing
the
diversity
and
beauty
in
fulfilment
of
this
intention
he
enlarged
the
earth
on
all
sides
and
made
the
sea
to
flow
as
a
separation
between
inhabited
places
so
that
it
might
vary
the
aspect
of
things
and
by
severing
their
roads
prevent
men
from
easily
discovering
the
confines
of
the
world
he
also
designed
the
sea
to
serve
as
a
vivid
representation
of
the
infinity
which
they
desired
then
it
was
that
the
waters
covered
the
island
atlantis
as
well
as
many
other
vast
tracts
of
country
but
the
remembrance
of
this
island
alone
has
survived
the
multitude
of
centuries
that
have
passed
since
that
time
jove
formed
valleys
by
lowering
certain
places
and
by
exalting
others
he
created
hills
and
mountains
he
bespread
the
night
with
stars
purified
the
atmosphere
increased
the
brilliancy
and
light
of
day
intensified
the
colours
of
the
sky
and
the
country
and
gave
them
more
variety
he
also
mixed
the
generations
of
men
so
that
the
aged
of
one
generation
were
contemporaneous
with
the
children
of
another
above
all
jove
determined
to
multiply
resemblances
of
that
infinity
for
which
men
so
eagerly
craved
he
could
not
really
satisfy
them
but
wishing
to
soothe
and
appease
their
imagination
which
he
knew
had
been
the
chief
source
of
their
happiness
in
childhood
he
employed
many
expedients
like
that
of
the
sea
he
created
the
echo
and
hid
it
in
valleys
and
caverns
and
gave
to
the
forests
a
dull
deep
whispering
conjoined
with
a
mysterious
undulation
of
their
he
created
also
the
gorgeous
land
of
dreams
and
gave
men
power
to
visit
it
in
their
sleep
there
they
could
experience
such
perfect
happiness
as
could
not
in
reality
be
accorded
to
them
this
served
as
a
substitute
for
the
vague
unrealisable
conception
of
felicity
formed
by
men
within
themselves
and
to
which
jove
himself
could
not
have
given
any
real
expression
had
he
desired
to
do
so
by
these
means
the
god
infused
new
strength
and
vigour
into
the
minds
of
men
and
endeared
life
to
them
again
so
that
they
were
full
of
admiration
for
the
beauty
and
immensity
of
nature
this
happy
state
lasted
longer
than
the
previous
one
its
duration
was
chiefly
due
to
the
diversity
of
ages
among
men
whereby
those
who
were
chilled
and
wearied
with
their
experience
of
the
world
were
comforted
by
the
society
of
others
full
of
the
ardency
and
hopefulness
of
youth
but
in
process
of
time
this
novelty
wore
off
and
men
again
became
discontented
and
wearied
with
life
so
despondent
did
they
become
that
then
is
said
to
have
originated
the
custom
attributed
by
history
to
certain
ancient
nations
the
birth
of
a
child
was
celebrated
with
tears
and
the
death
of
a
parent
was
the
occasion
of
rejoicing
for
his
deliverance
at
length
wickedness
became
universal
this
was
either
because
men
thought
that
jove
disregarded
them
or
because
it
is
the
nature
of
misfortune
to
debase
even
the
noblest
minds
it
is
a
popular
error
to
imagine
that
man
misfortunes
are
the
result
of
his
impiety
and
iniquity
on
the
contrary
his
wickedness
is
the
consequence
of
his
misfortunes
the
gods
avenged
themselves
for
their
injuries
and
punished
mortals
for
their
renewed
perverseness
by
the
deluge
of
deucalion
there
were
only
two
survivors
of
this
shipwreck
of
the
human
race
deucalion
and
pyrrha
these
unhappy
ones
were
filled
with
the
sense
of
their
wretchedness
and
far
from
regretting
the
loss
of
all
their
fellows
themselves
loudly
invoked
death
from
the
summit
of
a
rock
but
jove
commanded
them
to
remedy
the
depopulation
of
the
earth
and
seeing
that
they
had
not
the
heart
to
beget
a
new
generation
directed
them
to
take
stones
from
the
and
cast
them
over
their
shoulders
from
these
stones
men
were
created
and
the
earth
was
again
peopled
the
history
of
the
past
had
enlightened
jove
as
to
the
nature
of
men
and
had
shown
him
that
it
is
not
sufficient
for
them
as
for
other
animals
merely
to
live
in
a
state
of
freedom
from
sorrow
and
physical
discomfort
he
knew
that
whatever
their
condition
of
life
they
would
seek
the
impossible
and
if
unpossessed
of
genuine
evils
would
torment
themselves
with
imaginary
ones
the
god
resolved
therefore
to
employ
new
means
for
the
preservation
of
the
miserable
race
for
this
purpose
he
used
two
especial
artifices
in
the
first
place
he
strewed
life
with
veritable
evils
and
secondly
instituted
a
thousand
kinds
of
business
and
labour
to
distract
men
as
much
as
possible
from
and
their
desires
for
an
unknown
and
imaginary
happiness
he
began
by
sending
a
multitude
of
diseases
and
an
infinite
number
of
other
calamities
among
them
with
the
intention
of
varying
the
conditions
of
life
so
as
to
obviate
the
feeling
of
satiety
which
had
resulted
before
and
to
induce
men
to
esteem
the
good
things
they
possessed
so
much
the
more
by
contrast
with
these
new
evils
the
god
hoped
that
men
would
be
better
able
to
bear
the
absence
of
the
happiness
they
longed
for
when
occupied
and
under
the
discipline
of
suffering
he
also
determined
by
means
of
these
physical
infirmities
and
exertions
to
reduce
the
vigour
of
men
minds
to
humble
their
pride
to
make
them
bow
the
head
to
necessity
and
be
more
contented
with
their
lot
he
knew
that
disease
and
misfortune
would
operate
as
a
preventive
to
the
committal
of
those
acts
of
suicide
which
had
formerly
been
rife
for
they
would
not
only
make
men
cowardly
and
weak
but
would
help
to
attach
them
to
life
by
the
hope
of
an
existence
free
from
such
sufferings
for
it
is
a
characteristic
of
the
unfortunate
that
they
imagine
happiness
will
wait
on
them
as
soon
as
the
immediate
cause
of
their
present
misfortune
is
removed
jove
then
created
the
winds
and
the
prepared
the
thunder
and
lightning
gave
the
trident
to
neptune
launched
comets
and
arranged
eclipses
by
means
of
these
and
other
terrible
signs
he
resolved
to
frighten
mortals
from
time
to
time
knowing
that
fear
and
actual
danger
would
temporarily
reconcile
to
life
not
only
the
unhappy
but
even
those
who
most
detested
and
were
most
disposed
to
put
an
end
to
their
existence
as
a
cure
for
the
idleness
of
the
past
jove
gave
to
men
a
taste
and
desire
for
new
foods
and
drinks
unprocurable
however
without
the
greatest
exertions
previous
to
the
deluge
men
had
lived
on
water
herbs
and
such
fruits
as
were
yielded
by
the
earth
and
the
trees
just
as
certain
people
of
california
and
other
places
live
even
in
the
present
day
he
assigned
different
climates
to
different
countries
and
appointed
the
seasons
of
the
year
hitherto
there
had
been
no
diversity
of
temperature
in
any
place
but
the
atmosphere
was
uniformly
so
equable
and
mild
that
men
were
ignorant
of
the
use
of
clothing
now
however
they
were
obliged
to
exert
themselves
industriously
to
remedy
the
inclemency
and
changeability
of
the
weather
jove
gave
mercury
command
to
lay
the
foundations
of
the
first
cities
and
to
divide
men
into
different
races
nations
and
languages
separated
by
feelings
of
rivalry
and
discord
he
was
also
commissioned
to
teach
them
music
and
those
other
arts
which
owing
to
their
nature
and
origin
are
still
called
divine
jove
himself
distributed
laws
and
constitutions
to
the
new
nations
finally
as
a
supreme
gift
he
sent
among
men
certain
sublime
and
superhuman
phantoms
to
whom
he
committed
very
great
influence
and
control
over
the
people
of
the
earth
they
were
called
justice
virtue
glory
patriotism
among
these
phantoms
was
one
named
love
which
then
first
entered
the
world
for
previous
to
the
introduction
of
clothes
the
sexes
were
drawn
towards
one
another
by
merely
a
brute
instinct
far
different
from
love
the
feeling
was
comparable
to
that
which
we
experience
towards
articles
of
food
and
such
things
that
we
desire
but
do
not
love
by
these
divine
decrees
the
condition
of
man
was
infinitely
ameliorated
and
rendered
easier
and
pleasanter
than
before
in
spite
of
the
fatigues
sufferings
and
terrors
which
were
now
inseparable
from
humanity
and
this
result
was
chiefly
due
to
the
wonderful
chimeras
whom
some
men
regarded
as
genii
others
as
gods
and
whom
they
followed
with
an
intense
veneration
and
enthusiasm
for
a
very
long
time
to
such
a
pitch
was
their
ardour
excited
by
the
poets
and
artists
of
the
times
that
numbers
of
men
did
not
hesitate
to
sacrifice
their
lives
to
one
or
other
of
these
phantoms
far
from
displeasing
jove
this
fact
gratified
him
exceedingly
for
he
judged
that
if
men
esteemed
their
life
a
gift
worthy
of
sacrifice
to
these
fine
and
glorious
illusions
they
would
be
less
likely
to
repudiate
it
as
before
this
happy
state
of
affairs
was
of
longer
duration
than
the
preceding
ages
and
even
when
after
the
lapse
of
many
centuries
a
tendency
to
decline
became
apparent
existence
thanks
to
these
bright
illusions
was
still
easy
and
bearable
enough
up
to
a
time
not
very
far
distant
from
the
present
this
decline
was
chiefly
due
to
the
facility
with
which
men
were
able
to
satisfy
their
wants
and
desires
the
growing
inequality
between
men
in
their
social
and
other
conditions
as
they
receded
farther
and
farther
from
the
republican
models
founded
by
jove
the
reappearance
of
vanity
and
idleness
as
a
consequence
of
this
retrocession
the
diminishing
interest
with
which
the
variety
of
life
incidents
inspired
them
and
many
other
and
important
causes
again
men
were
filled
with
the
old
feeling
of
disgust
for
their
existence
and
again
their
minds
clamoured
for
an
unknown
happiness
inconsistent
with
the
order
of
nature
but
the
total
revolution
of
the
fortunes
of
men
and
the
end
of
that
epoch
which
we
nowadays
designate
as
the
old
world
was
due
to
one
especial
influence
it
was
this
among
the
phantoms
so
appreciated
by
the
ancients
was
a
certain
one
called
wisdom
this
phantom
had
duly
contributed
to
the
prosperity
of
the
times
and
like
the
others
received
high
honour
from
men
a
number
of
whom
consecrated
themselves
to
her
service
she
had
frequently
promised
her
disciples
to
show
them
her
mistress
the
truth
a
superior
spirit
who
associated
with
the
gods
in
heaven
whence
she
had
never
yet
descended
the
phantom
assured
them
that
she
would
bring
truth
among
men
and
that
this
spirit
would
exercise
so
marvellous
an
influence
over
their
life
that
in
knowledge
perfection
and
happiness
they
would
almost
rival
the
gods
themselves
but
how
could
a
shadow
fulfil
any
promise
much
less
induce
the
truth
to
descend
to
earth
so
after
a
long
confiding
expectancy
men
perceived
the
falseness
of
wisdom
at
the
same
time
greedy
of
novelty
because
of
the
idleness
of
their
life
and
stimulated
partly
by
ambition
of
equalling
the
gods
and
partly
by
the
intensity
of
their
yearning
for
the
happiness
they
imagined
would
ensue
from
the
possession
of
truth
they
presumptuously
requested
jove
to
lend
them
this
noble
spirit
for
a
time
and
reproached
him
for
having
so
long
jealously
withheld
from
men
the
great
advantages
that
would
follow
from
the
presence
of
truth
they
with
one
accord
expressed
dissatisfaction
with
their
lot
and
renewed
their
former
hateful
whinings
about
the
meanness
and
misery
of
human
things
the
phantoms
once
so
dear
to
them
were
now
almost
entirely
abandoned
not
that
men
had
discerned
the
unreality
of
their
nature
but
because
they
were
so
debased
in
mind
and
manners
as
to
have
no
sympathy
with
even
the
appearance
of
goodness
thus
they
wickedly
rejected
the
greatest
gift
of
gods
to
men
and
excused
themselves
by
saying
that
none
but
inferior
genii
had
been
sent
on
earth
the
nobler
ones
whom
they
would
willingly
have
worshipped
being
retained
in
heaven
many
things
long
before
this
had
contributed
to
lessen
the
goodwill
of
jove
towards
men
especially
the
magnitude
and
number
of
their
vices
and
crimes
which
were
far
in
advance
of
those
punished
by
the
deluge
he
was
out
of
patience
with
the
human
race
the
restless
and
unreasonable
nature
of
which
exasperated
him
he
recognised
the
futility
of
all
effort
on
his
part
to
make
men
happy
and
contented
had
he
not
enlarged
the
world
multiplied
its
pleasures
and
increased
its
diversity
yet
all
things
were
soon
regarded
by
men
desirous
and
at
the
same
time
incapable
of
infinity
as
equally
restricted
and
valueless
jove
determined
therefore
to
make
a
perpetual
example
of
the
human
race
he
resolved
to
punish
men
unsparingly
and
reduce
them
to
a
state
of
misery
far
surpassing
their
former
condition
towards
the
attainment
of
this
end
he
purposed
sending
truth
among
men
not
for
a
time
only
as
they
desired
but
for
eternity
and
giving
her
supreme
control
and
dominion
over
the
human
race
instead
of
the
phantoms
that
were
now
so
greatly
despised
the
other
gods
marvelled
at
this
decision
of
jove
as
likely
to
exalt
the
human
race
to
a
degree
prejudicial
to
their
own
dignity
but
he
explained
to
them
that
all
genii
are
not
beneficial
and
that
apart
from
this
it
was
not
of
the
nature
of
truth
to
produce
the
same
results
among
men
as
with
the
gods
for
whereas
to
the
gods
she
unveiled
the
eternity
of
their
joy
to
mortals
she
would
expose
the
immensity
of
their
unhappiness
representing
it
to
them
not
as
a
matter
of
chance
but
as
an
inevitable
and
perpetual
necessity
and
since
human
evils
are
great
in
proportion
as
they
are
believed
to
be
so
by
their
victims
it
may
be
imagined
how
acute
an
affliction
truth
will
prove
to
men
the
vanity
of
all
earthly
things
will
be
apparent
to
them
they
will
find
that
nothing
is
genuine
save
their
own
unhappiness
above
all
they
will
lose
hope
hitherto
the
greatest
solace
and
support
of
life
deprived
of
hope
they
will
have
nothing
to
stimulate
them
to
any
exertions
consequently
work
industry
and
all
mental
culture
will
languish
and
the
life
of
the
living
will
partake
of
the
inertness
of
the
grave
yet
in
spite
of
their
despair
and
inactivity
men
will
still
be
tormented
by
their
old
longing
for
happiness
intensified
and
quickened
because
they
will
be
less
distracted
by
cares
and
the
stir
of
action
they
will
also
be
deprived
of
the
power
of
imagination
which
in
itself
could
mysteriously
transport
them
into
a
state
of
happiness
comparable
to
the
felicity
for
which
they
long
and
said
jove
all
those
representations
of
infinity
which
i
designedly
placed
in
the
world
to
deceive
and
satisfy
men
and
all
the
vague
thoughts
suggestive
of
happiness
which
i
infused
into
their
minds
will
yield
to
the
doctrines
of
truth
the
earth
which
formerly
displeased
them
for
its
insignificance
will
do
so
increasedly
when
its
true
dimensions
are
known
and
when
all
the
secrets
of
nature
are
made
manifest
to
them
and
finally
with
the
disappearance
of
those
phantoms
that
alone
gave
brightness
to
existence
human
life
will
become
aimless
and
valueless
nations
and
countries
will
lose
even
their
names
for
with
patriotism
will
vanish
all
incentive
to
national
identities
men
will
unite
and
form
one
nation
and
one
people
as
they
will
say
and
will
profess
a
universal
love
for
the
race
but
in
reality
there
will
be
the
least
possible
union
amongst
them
they
will
be
divided
into
as
many
peoples
as
there
are
individuals
for
having
no
special
country
to
love
and
no
foreigners
to
hate
every
man
will
hate
his
neighbour
and
love
only
himself
the
evil
consequences
of
this
are
incalculable
nevertheless
men
will
not
put
an
end
to
their
unhappiness
by
depriving
themselves
of
life
because
under
the
sway
of
truth
they
will
become
as
cowardly
as
miserable
truth
will
increase
the
bitterness
of
their
existence
and
at
the
same
time
bereave
them
of
sufficient
courage
to
reject
it
these
words
of
jove
moved
the
gods
to
compassion
for
the
human
race
it
seemed
to
them
that
so
great
inflictions
were
inconsistent
with
the
divine
attribute
of
mercy
but
jove
continued
there
will
remain
to
humanity
a
certain
consolation
proceeding
from
the
phantom
love
which
alone
i
purpose
leaving
among
men
and
even
truth
in
spite
of
her
almost
omnipotence
will
never
quite
prevail
over
love
nor
succeed
in
chasing
this
phantom
from
the
earth
though
the
struggle
between
them
will
be
perpetual
thus
the
life
of
man
divided
betwixt
the
worship
of
truth
and
love
will
consist
of
two
epochs
during
which
these
influences
will
respectively
control
his
mind
and
actions
to
the
aged
instead
of
the
solace
of
love
will
be
granted
a
state
of
contentment
with
their
existence
similar
to
that
of
other
animals
they
will
love
life
for
its
own
sake
not
for
any
pleasure
or
profit
they
derive
from
it
accordingly
jove
removed
the
phantoms
from
earth
save
only
love
the
least
noble
of
all
and
sent
truth
among
men
to
exercise
over
them
perpetual
rule
the
consequences
foreseen
by
the
god
were
not
long
in
making
themselves
manifest
and
strange
to
say
whereas
the
spirit
before
her
descent
on
earth
and
when
she
had
no
real
authority
over
men
was
honoured
by
a
multitude
of
temples
and
sacrifices
her
presence
had
the
effect
of
cooling
their
enthusiasm
on
her
behalf
with
the
other
gods
this
was
not
so
the
more
they
made
themselves
manifest
the
more
they
were
honoured
but
truth
saddened
men
and
ultimately
inspired
them
with
such
hatred
that
they
refused
to
worship
her
and
only
by
constraint
rendered
her
obedience
and
whereas
formerly
men
who
were
under
the
especial
influence
of
any
one
of
the
ancient
phantoms
used
to
love
and
revere
that
phantom
above
the
others
truth
was
detested
and
cursed
by
those
over
whom
she
gained
supreme
control
so
unable
to
resist
her
tyranny
men
lived
from
that
time
in
the
complete
state
of
misery
which
is
their
fate
in
the
present
day
and
to
which
they
are
eternally
doomed
but
not
long
ago
pity
which
is
never
exhausted
in
the
minds
of
the
gods
moved
jove
to
compassionate
the
wretchedness
of
mortals
he
noticed
especially
the
affliction
of
certain
men
remarkable
for
their
high
intellect
and
nobility
and
purity
of
life
who
were
extraordinarily
oppressed
by
the
sway
of
truth
now
in
former
times
when
justice
virtue
and
the
other
phantoms
directed
humanity
the
gods
had
been
accustomed
at
times
to
visit
the
earth
and
sojourn
with
men
for
awhile
always
on
such
occasions
benefiting
the
race
or
particular
individuals
in
some
especial
manner
but
since
men
had
become
so
debased
and
sunk
in
wickedness
they
had
not
deigned
to
associate
with
them
jove
therefore
pitying
our
condition
asked
the
immortals
whether
any
one
of
them
would
visit
the
earth
as
of
old
and
console
men
under
their
calamities
especially
such
as
seemed
undeserving
of
the
universal
affliction
all
the
gods
were
silent
at
length
love
the
son
of
celestial
venus
bearing
the
same
name
as
the
phantom
love
but
very
different
in
nature
and
power
and
the
most
compassionate
of
the
immortals
offered
himself
for
the
mission
proposed
by
jove
this
deity
was
so
beloved
by
the
other
gods
that
hitherto
they
had
never
allowed
him
to
quit
their
presence
even
for
a
moment
the
ancients
indeed
imagined
that
the
god
had
appeared
to
them
from
time
to
time
but
it
was
not
so
they
were
deceived
by
the
subterfuges
and
transformations
of
the
phantom
love
the
deity
of
the
same
name
first
visited
mankind
after
they
were
placed
under
the
empire
of
truth
since
that
time
the
god
has
rarely
and
briefly
descended
because
of
the
general
unworthiness
of
humanity
and
the
impatience
with
which
the
celestials
await
his
return
when
he
comes
on
earth
he
chooses
the
tender
and
noble
hearts
of
the
most
generous
and
magnanimous
persons
here
he
rests
for
a
short
time
diffusing
in
them
so
strange
and
wondrous
a
sweetness
and
inspiring
them
with
affections
so
lofty
and
vigorous
that
they
then
experience
what
is
entirely
new
to
mankind
the
substance
rather
than
the
semblance
of
happiness
sometimes
though
very
rarely
he
brings
about
the
union
of
two
hearts
abiding
in
them
both
simultaneously
and
exciting
within
them
a
reciprocal
warmth
and
desire
all
within
whom
he
dwells
beseech
him
to
effect
this
union
but
jove
forbids
him
to
yield
to
their
entreaties
save
in
very
few
instances
because
the
happiness
of
such
mutual
love
approaches
too
nearly
to
the
felicity
of
the
immortals
the
man
in
whom
love
abides
is
the
happiest
of
mortals
and
not
only
is
he
blessed
by
the
presence
of
the
deity
but
he
is
also
charmed
by
the
old
mysterious
phantoms
which
though
removed
from
the
lot
of
men
by
jove
permission
follow
in
the
train
of
love
in
spite
of
the
great
opposition
of
truth
their
supreme
enemy
but
truth
like
all
the
other
genii
is
powerless
to
resist
the
will
of
the
gods
and
since
destiny
has
granted
to
love
a
state
of
eternal
youth
the
god
can
partially
give
effect
to
that
first
desire
of
men
that
they
might
return
to
the
happiness
of
their
childhood
in
the
souls
he
inhabits
love
awakens
and
vivifies
so
long
as
ha
stays
there
the
boundless
hopes
and
the
sweet
and
fine
illusions
of
early
life
many
persons
ignorant
and
incapable
of
appreciating
love
vituperate
and
affront
the
god
even
to
his
face
but
he
disregards
these
insults
and
exacts
no
vengeance
for
them
so
noble
and
compassionate
is
his
nature
nor
do
the
other
gods
any
longer
trouble
themselves
about
the
crimes
of
men
being
satisfied
with
the
vengeance
they
have
already
wrought
on
the
human
race
and
the
incurable
misery
which
is
its
portion
consequently
wicked
and
blasphemous
men
suffer
no
punishment
for
their
offences
except
that
they
are
absolutely
excluded
from
being
partakers
of
the
divine
favours

atlas
jove
compliments
and
in
case
you
should
be
weary
of
your
burden
i
was
to
relieve
you
for
a
few
hours
as
i
did
i
do
know
how
many
centuries
ago
so
that
you
may
take
breath
and
rest
a
little
thanks
dear
hercules
and
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
jove
but
the
world
has
become
so
light
that
this
cloak
which
i
wear
as
a
protection
against
the
snow
incommodes
me
more
indeed
were
it
not
jove
will
that
i
should
continue
to
stand
here
supporting
this
ball
on
my
back
i
would
put
it
under
my
arm
or
in
my
pocket
or
suspend
it
from
a
hair
of
my
beard
and
go
about
my
own
affairs
how
has
it
become
so
light
i
can
easily
see
it
has
changed
shape
and
has
become
a
sort
of
roll
instead
of
being
round
as
when
i
studied
cosmography
in
preparation
for
that
wonderful
voyage
with
the
argonauts
but
still
i
can
not
see
why
its
weight
should
have
diminished
i
am
as
ignorant
of
the
reason
as
you
are
but
take
the
thing
for
a
moment
in
your
hand
and
satisfy
yourself
of
the
truth
of
my
assertion
upon
my
word
without
this
test
i
would
not
have
believed
it
but
what
is
this
other
novelty
that
i
discover
the
last
time
i
bore
it
i
felt
a
strong
pulsation
on
my
back
like
the
beat
of
an
animal
heart
and
i
heard
a
continuous
buzzing
like
a
wasp
nest
but
now
it
throbs
more
like
a
watch
with
a
broken
spring
and
as
for
the
buzzing
i
do
hear
a
sound
of
it
i
know
nothing
of
this
either
except
that
long
ago
the
world
ceased
making
any
motion
or
sensible
noise
i
even
had
very
great
suspicions
that
it
was
dead
and
expecting
daily
to
be
troubled
by
its
corruption
i
considered
how
and
where
i
should
bury
it
and
what
epitaph
i
should
place
on
its
tomb
but
when
i
saw
that
it
did
not
decompose
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
had
changed
from
an
animal
into
a
plant
like
daphne
and
others
and
this
explained
its
silence
and
immobility
i
began
to
fear
lest
it
should
soon
wind
its
roots
round
my
shoulders
or
bury
them
in
my
body
i
am
rather
inclined
to
think
it
is
asleep
and
that
its
repose
is
like
that
of
epimenides
which
lasted
more
than
half
a
century
or
perhaps
it
is
like
hermotimus
whose
soul
used
to
leave
his
body
when
it
pleased
and
stay
away
many
years
disporting
itself
in
foreign
lands
to
put
an
end
to
this
game
the
friends
of
hermotimus
burned
the
body
so
that
the
spirit
returning
found
its
home
destroyed
and
was
obliged
to
seek
shelter
in
another
body
or
an
inn
so
to
prevent
the
world
from
sleeping
for
ever
or
lest
some
friend
thinking
it
were
dead
should
set
it
on
fire
let
us
try
to
arouse
it
i
am
willing
but
how
shall
we
do
it
i
would
give
it
a
good
blow
with
this
club
if
i
were
not
afraid
of
smashing
it
and
were
i
not
sure
that
it
would
crack
under
the
stroke
like
an
egg
besides
i
fear
lest
the
men
who
in
my
time
used
to
wrestle
with
lions
but
are
now
only
a
match
for
fleas
should
faint
from
so
sudden
a
shock
suppose
i
lay
aside
my
club
and
you
your
cloak
and
we
have
a
game
at
ball
with
the
poor
little
sphere
i
wish
i
had
brought
the
rackets
that
mercury
and
i
use
in
the
celestial
courts
but
we
can
do
without
them
a
likely
thing
indeed
so
that
your
father
seeing
our
game
may
make
a
third
and
with
his
thunderbolt
precipitate
us
both
i
do
not
know
where
as
he
did
phaeton
into
the
po
that
might
be
if
like
phaeton
i
were
the
son
of
a
poet
and
not
his
own
son
and
if
there
were
not
this
difference
between
us
that
whereas
poets
formerly
peopled
cities
by
the
melody
of
their
art
i
could
depopulate
heaven
and
earth
by
the
power
of
my
club
and
as
for
jove
bolt
i
would
kick
it
hence
to
the
farthest
quarter
of
the
empyrean
be
assured
that
even
if
i
wished
to
appropriate
five
or
six
stars
for
the
sake
of
a
game
or
to
make
a
sling
of
a
comet
taking
it
by
the
tail
or
even
to
play
at
ball
with
the
sun
my
father
would
make
no
objection
besides
our
intention
is
to
do
good
to
the
world
whereas
phaeton
simply
wished
to
show
off
his
fleetness
before
the
hours
who
held
the
steps
for
him
when
he
mounted
his
chariot
he
also
wanted
to
gain
reputation
as
a
skilful
in
the
eyes
of
andromeda
callisto
and
the
other
beautiful
constellations
to
whom
it
is
said
he
threw
in
passing
lustre
bonbons
and
comfits
of
light
and
to
make
a
fine
parade
of
himself
before
the
celestial
gods
during
his
journey
that
day
which
chanced
to
be
a
festival
in
short
give
a
thought
to
the
possibility
of
my
father
wrath
in
any
case
i
will
bear
all
the
blame
so
throw
off
your
cloak
and
send
me
the
ball
willingly
or
not
i
must
do
as
you
wish
since
you
are
strong
and
armed
whereas
i
am
old
and
defenceless
but
do
take
care
lest
it
fall
in
which
case
it
will
have
fresh
swellings
or
some
new
fracture
like
that
which
separated
sicily
from
italy
and
africa
from
spain
and
if
it
should
get
chipped
in
any
way
there
might
be
a
war
about
what
men
would
call
the
detachment
of
a
province
or
kingdom
rely
on
me
then
here
goes
see
how
it
quivers
on
account
of
its
altered
shape
hit
a
little
harder
your
strokes
scarcely
reach
me
it
is
the
fault
of
the
ball
the
wind
catches
it
because
of
its
lightness
it
is
its
old
failing
to
go
with
the
wind
suppose
we
were
to
inflate
the
ball
since
it
has
no
more
notion
of
a
bounce
than
a
melon
a
new
shortcoming
formerly
it
used
to
leap
and
dance
like
a
young
goat
look
out
run
quickly
after
that
for
jove
sake
take
care
lest
it
fall
alas
it
was
an
evil
hour
when
you
came
here
you
sent
me
such
a
bad
stroke
that
i
could
not
possibly
have
caught
it
in
time
even
at
the
risk
of
breaking
my
neck
alas
poor
little
one
how
are
you
do
you
feel
bad
anywhere
i
do
hear
a
sigh
nor
does
a
soul
move
they
are
all
still
asleep
give
it
back
to
me
by
all
the
horns
of
the
styx
and
let
me
settle
it
again
on
my
shoulders
and
you
take
your
club
and
hasten
to
heaven
to
excuse
me
with
jove
for
this
accident
which
is
entirely
owing
to
you
i
will
do
so
for
many
centuries
there
has
been
in
my
father
house
a
certain
poet
named
horace
he
was
made
court
poet
at
the
suggestion
of
augustus
who
has
been
deified
by
jove
for
his
augmentation
of
the
eoman
power
in
one
of
his
songs
this
poet
says
that
the
just
man
would
stir
not
though
the
world
fell
since
the
world
has
now
fallen
and
no
one
has
moved
it
follows
that
all
men
are
just
who
doubts
the
justice
of
men
but
do
not
lose
time
run
and
exculpate
me
with
your
father
else
i
shall
momentarily
expect
a
thunderbolt
to
transform
me
from
atlas
into
etna

my

should

i
do
i

also
that

equally

of

you

in

in

to
some

inside

raise
your

pronounce

more
distinctly
if
you
go
mumbling
between
your
teeth
with

i
shall
never

because
you
ought
to
know
that
my

serves
me
no

than
my

although
it
be
contrary
to
custom
for
in
france
they
do
not
speak
to
be
heard
yet
since
we
are
sisters
i
will
speak
as
you
wish
for
we
can
dispense
with
ceremony
between
ourselves
i
say
then
that
our
common
nature
and
custom
is
to
incessantly
renew
the
world
you
attack
the
life
of
man
and
overthrow
all
people
and
nations
from
beginning
to
end
whereas
i
content
myself
for
the
most
part
with
influencing
beards
costumes
furniture
houses
and
the
like
it
is
true
i
do
some
things
comparable
to
your
supreme
action
i
pierce
ears
lips
and
noses
and
cause
them
to
be
torn
by
the
ornaments
i
suspend
from
them
i
impress
men
skin
with
hot
iron
stamps
under
the
pretence
of
adornment
i
compress
the
heads
of
children
with
tight
bandages
and
other
contrivances
and
make
it
customary
for
all
men
of
a
country
to
have
heads
of
the
same
shape
as
in
parts
of
america
and
asia
i
torture
and
cripple
people
with
small
shoes
i
stifle
women
with
stays
so
tight
that
their
eyes
start
from
their
heads
and
i
play
a
thousand
similar
pranks
i
also
frequently
persuade
and
force
men
of
refinement
to
bear
daily
numberless
fatigues
and
discomforts
and
often
real
sufferings
and
some
even
die
gloriously
for
love
of
me
i
will
say
nothing
of
the
headaches
colds
inflammations
of
all
kinds
fevers
daily
tertian
and
quartan
which
men
gain
by
their
obedience
to
me
they
are
content
to
shiver
with
cold
or
melt
with
heat
simply
because
it
is
my
will
that
they
cover
their
shoulders
with
wool
and
their
breasts
with
cotton
in
fact
they
do
everything
in
my
way
regardless
of
their
own
injury
in
truth
i
believe
you
are
my
sister
the
testimony
of
a
birth
certificate
could
scarcely
make
me
surer
of
it
but
standing
still
paralyses
me
so
if
you
can
let
us
run
only
you
must
not
creep
because
i
go
at
a
great
pace
as
we
proceed
you
can
tell
me
what
you
want
if
you
can
not
keep
up
with
me
on
account
of
our
relationship
i
promise
when
i
die
to
bequeath
you
all
my
clothes
and
effects
as
a
new
year
gift
if
we
ran
a
race
together
i
hardly
know
which
of
us
would
win
for
if
you
run
i
gallop
and
standing
still
which
paralyses
you
is
death
to
me
so
let
us
run
and
we
will
chat
as
we
go
along
so
be
it
then
since
your
mother
was
mine
you
ought
to
serve
me
in
some
way
and
assist
me
in
my
business
i
have
already
done
so
more
than
you
imagine
above
all
i
who
annul
and
transform
other
customs
unceasingly
have
nowhere
changed
the
custom
of
death
for
this
reason
it
has
prevailed
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
until
now
a
great
miracle
forsooth
that
you
have
never
done
what
you
could
not
do
why
can
not
i
do
it
you
show
how
ignorant
you
are
of
the
power
of
fashion
well
well
time
enough
to
talk
of
this
when
you
introduce
the
custom
of
not
dying
but
at
present
i
want
you
like
a
good
sister
to
aid
me
in
rendering
my
task
more
easy
and
expeditious
than
it
has
hitherto
been
i
have
already
mentioned
some
of
my
labours
which
are
a
source
of
profit
to
you
but
they
are
trifling
in
comparison
with
those
of
which
i
will
now
tell
you
little
by
little
and
especially
in
modern
times
i
have
brought
into
disuse
and
discredit
those
exertions
and
exercises
which
promote
bodily
health
and
have
substituted
numberless
others
which
enfeeble
the
body
in
a
thousand
ways
and
shorten
life
besides
i
have
introduced
customs
and
manners
which
render
existence
a
thing
more
dead
than
alive
whether
regarded
from
a
physical
or
mental
point
of
view
so
that
this
century
may
be
aptly
termed
the
century
of
death
and
whereas
formerly
you
had
no
other
possessions
except
graves
and
vaults
where
you
sowed
bones
and
dust
which
are
but
a
barren
seed
now
you
have
fine
landed
properties
and
people
who
are
a
sort
of
freehold
possession
of
yours
as
soon
as
they
are
born
though
not
then
claimed
by
you
and
more
you
who
used
formerly
to
be
hated
and
vituperated
are
in
the
present
day
thanks
to
me
valued
and
lauded
by
all
men
of
genius
such
an
one
prefers
you
to
life
itself
and
holds
you
in
such
high
esteem
that
he
invokes
you
and
looks
to
you
as
his
greatest
hope
but
this
is
not
all
i
perceived
that
men
had
some
vague
idea
of
an
which
they
called
immortality
they
imagined
they
lived
in
the
memory
of
their
fellows
and
this
remembrance
they
sought
after
eagerly
of
course
this
was
in
reality
mere
fancy
since
what
could
it
matter
to
them
when
dead
that
they
lived
in
the
minds
of
men
as
well
might
they
dread
contamination
in
the
grave
yet
fearing
lest
this
chimera
might
be
prejudicial
to
you
in
seeming
to
diminish
your
honour
and
reputation
i
have
abolished
the
fashion
of
seeking
immortality
and
its
concession
even
when
merited
so
that
now
whoever
dies
may
assure
himself
that
he
is
dead
altogether
and
that
every
bit
of
him
goes
into
the
ground
just
as
a
little
fish
is
swallowed
bones
and
all
these
important
things
my
love
for
you
has
prompted
me
to
effect
i
have
also
succeeded
in
my
endeavour
to
increase
your
power
on
earth
i
am
more
than
ever
desirous
of
continuing
this
work
indeed
my
object
in
seeking
you
was
to
make
a
proposal
that
for
the
future
we
should
not
separate
but
jointly
might
scheme
and
execute
for
the
furtherance
of
our
respective
designs
you
speak
reasonably
and
i
am
willing
to
do
as
you
propose
competition
announced
by
the
academy
of
the
academy
of
sillographs
ardently
desiring
to
advance
the
common
welfare
and
esteeming
nothing
more
conformable
to
this
end
than
the
promotion
of
the
progress
of
the
happy
century
in
which
we
live
as
says
an
illustrious
poet
has
taken
in
hand
the
careful
consideration
of
the
nature
and
tendency
of
our
time
after
long
and
mature
consultation
the
academy
has
resolved
to
call
our
era
the
age
of
machines
not
only
because
the
men
of
live
and
move
perhaps
more
mechanically
than
in
past
times
but
also
on
account
of
the
numerous
machines
now
invented
and
utilised
for
so
many
different
purposes
to
such
an
extent
indeed
is
this
carried
that
machines
and
not
men
may
be
said
to
manage
human
affairs
and
conduct
the
business
of
life
this
circumstance
greatly
pleases
the
said
academy
not
so
much
because
of
the
manifest
convenience
of
the
arrangement
as
for
two
reasons
which
it
thinks
very
important
although
ordinarily
they
are
not
so
regarded
the
one
is
the
possibility
that
in
process
of
time
the
influence
and
usefulness
of
machines
may
extend
to
spiritual
as
well
as
material
things
and
as
by
virtue
of
these
machines
and
inventions
we
are
already
protected
from
lightning
storms
and
other
such
evils
and
terrors
similarly
there
may
be
discovered
some
cure
for
envy
calumny
perfidy
and
trickery
some
or
other
invention
to
deliver
us
from
egotism
from
the
prevalence
of
mediocrity
from
prosperous
fools
bad
and
debased
persons
from
the
universal
spirit
of
indifference
from
the
wretchedness
peculiar
to
the
wise
the
cultivated
the
and
from
other
discomforts
which
for
many
centuries
have
been
more
invincible
than
either
lightning
or
tempests
the
other
and
chief
reason
concerns
the
unhappy
condition
of
the
human
race
most
philosophers
despair
of
its
improvement
or
the
cure
of
its
defects
which
probably
equal
or
exceed
in
number
its
virtues
they
believe
it
would
be
easier
to
entirely
the
race
in
another
way
or
to
substitute
a
different
genus
altogether
than
to
amend
it
the
academy
of
sinographs
is
therefore
of
opinion
that
it
is
very
expedient
for
men
to
withdraw
from
the
business
of
life
as
much
as
possible
and
gradually
to
resign
in
favour
of
machines
and
being
resolved
to
support
with
all
its
might
the
progress
of
this
new
order
of
things
it
now
begs
to
offer
three
prizes
for
the
inventors
of
the
three
following
machines
the
aim
of
the
first
machine
must
be
to
represent
a
friend
warranted
not
to
abuse
or
ridicule
his
absent
friend
nor
forsake
his
friend
when
he
hears
him
made
the
subject
of
jest
nor
to
seek
the
reputation
of
acuteness
sarcasm
and
the
power
of
exciting
men
laughter
at
his
friend
expense
nor
to
divulge
or
boast
of
secrets
confided
to
him
nor
to
take
advantage
of
his
friend
intimacy
and
confidence
in
order
to
supplant
and
surpass
him
nor
to
envy
his
friend
good
fortune
but
it
must
be
solicitous
for
his
friend
welfare
join
issue
with
him
against
his
misfortunes
and
assist
him
in
deeds
as
well
as
words
reference
to
the
treatises
of
cicero
and
the
marquise
of
lambert
on
friendship
may
be
advantageously
made
for
further
suggestions
as
to
the
manufacture
of
this
automaton
the
academy
thinks
the
invention
of
this
machine
ought
not
to
be
regarded
as
either
impossible
or
even
very
difficult
seeing
that
besides
the
automata
of
regiomontano
vaucanson
and
others
and
the
one
in
london
which
drew
figures
and
portraits
and
wrote
from
dictation
there
are
machines
that
can
even
play
chess
unassisted
now
in
the
opinion
of
many
savants
human
life
is
a
game
and
some
assert
it
to
be
a
thing
even
more
frivolous
they
say
that
the
game
of
chess
is
a
more
rationally
conceived
thing
and
its
hazards
are
less
uncertain
than
those
of
life
besides
pindar
has
called
life
a
thing
of
no
more
substance
than
the
dream
of
a
shadow
in
which
case
it
ought
not
to
be
beyond
the
capacity
of
a
vigilant
automaton
as
to
speech
there
is
no
reason
why
men
should
not
be
able
to
communicate
this
to
machines
of
their
manufacture
for
amongst
examples
of
manufactures
so
endowed
we
may
number
the
statue
of
memnon
and
the
head
formed
by
albertus
magnus
this
latter
was
so
loquacious
that
thomas
aquinas
irritated
at
its
incessant
broke
it
in
pieces
and
if
the
parrot
of
nevers
though
certainly
this
was
an
animal
however
small
a
one
could
converse
how
much
more
credible
that
a
machine
conceived
by
the
mind
of
man
and
constructed
by
his
hands
should
be
able
to
acquire
such
attainments
the
machine
ought
not
to
be
so
talkative
as
the
parrot
of
nevers
and
other
similar
ones
which
we
see
and
hear
everywhere
nor
as
the
head
made
by
albertus
magnus
for
it
must
not
weary
its
friend
thereby
inciting
him
to
its
destruction
the
inventor
of
this
machine
shall
receive
a
reward
of
a
gold
medal
weighing
four
hundred
sequins
which
on
the
one
side
shall
have
a
representation
of
the
figures
of
pylades
and
orestes
and
on
the
other
side
the
name
of
the
person
rewarded
together
with
the
inscription
first
verifier
of
the
ancient
fables
the
second
machine
must
be
an
artificial
man
worked
by
steam
adapted
and
constructed
for
virtuous
and
magnanimous
actions
the
academy
is
of
opinion
that
since
no
other
method
appears
to
exist
steam
ought
to
be
capable
of
directing
an
animated
automaton
in
the
paths
of
virtue
and
glory
candidates
for
this
competition
are
referred
to
books
of
poems
and
romances
for
suggestions
as
to
the
qualities
and
powers
with
which
to
endow
the
figure
the
reward
to
be
a
gold
medal
weighing
four
hundred
and
fifty
sequins
stamped
on
the
one
side
with
some
fanciful
design
significative
of
the
age
of
gold
and
on
its
reverse
the
name
of
the
inventor
of
the
machine
together
with
this
inscription
from
the
fourth
eclogue
of
virgil
quo
ferrea
primum
desinet
ac
toto
surget
gens
aurea
mundo
the
third
machine
should
be
empowered
to
act
as
a
woman
realising
the
conception
formed
partly
by
count
baldassar
castiglione
who
describes
his
idea
in
the
book
of
the
cortegiano
and
partly
by
others
easily
discoverable
in
various
writings
which
must
be
consulted
and
combined
with
those
of
the
count
nor
ought
the
invention
of
this
machine
to
appear
impossible
to
men
of
our
times
when
it
be
remembered
that
pygmalion
long
ago
in
an
age
far
from
scientific
was
able
to
fabricate
a
spouse
with
his
own
hands
who
was
considered
to
be
the
best
woman
that
had
ever
existed
to
the
originator
of
this
machine
a
gold
medal
weighing
five
hundred
sequins
is
assigned
on
the
one
side
of
which
shall
be
represented
the
arabian
phoenix
of
metastasio
perched
on
a
tree
of
some
european
species
and
on
the
other
side
shall
be
written
the
name
of
the
recipient
with
the
inscription
inventor
of
faithful
women
and
conjugal
happiness
the
academy
decrees
that
the
cost
of
these
prizes
must
be
defrayed
with
what
was
discovered
in
the
satchel
of
diogenes
late
secretary
of
this
academy
or
by
means
of
one
of
the
three
golden
asses
that
belonged
to
three
sillographic
academicians
apuleius
firenzuola
and
macchiavelli
all
which
property
passed
to
the
sillographists
by
will
of
the
deceased
as
may
be
read
in
the
chronicles
of
the
academy
between
a
goblin
and
a
you
here
son
of
beelzebub
where
are
you
going
my
father
has
sent
me
to
find
out
what
these
rascals
of
men
are
doing
he
is
inclined
to
suspect
something
because
it
is
so
long
since
they
gave
us
any
trouble
and
in
all
his
realms
there
is
not
a
single
one
to
be
seen
he
wonders
whether
any
great
change
has
taken
place
and
thinks
perhaps
they
have
returned
to
the
primitive
system
of
barter
whereby
they
use
sheep
instead
of
gold
and
silver
or
the
civilised
people
have
become
dissatisfied
with
paper
notes
for
money
as
they
have
often
been
or
have
taken
to
cowrie
shells
such
as
savages
use
or
the
laws
of
lycurgus
have
been
the
last
possibility
seems
to
him
the
least
likely
you
seek
them
in
vain
for
they
are
all
dead
as
said
the
survivors
in
a
tragedy
where
the
principal
personages
died
in
the
last
act
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
men
are
all
dead
and
the
race
is
lost
my
word
what
news
for
the
papers
but
how
is
it
they
have
not
already
mentioned
it
stupid
do
you
not
see
that
if
there
are
no
men
there
will
be
no
more
newspapers
yes
that
is
true
but
how
shall
we
know
in
future
the
news
of
the
world
news
what
news
that
the
sun
rises
and
sets
that
it
is
hot
or
cold
that
here
or
there
it
has
rained
or
snowed
or
been
windy
since
men
disappeared
fortune
has
unbandaged
her
eyes
put
on
spectacles
and
attached
her
wheel
to
a
pivot
she
sits
with
arms
crossed
watching
the
world
go
round
without
troubling
herself
in
the
least
as
to
its
affairs
there
are
no
more
kingdoms
nor
empires
to
swell
themselves
and
burst
like
bubbles
for
they
have
all
vanished
there
is
no
more
war
and
the
years
are
as
like
one
another
as
two
peas
no
one
will
know
the
day
of
the
month
since
there
will
be
no
more
calendars
printed
what
a
misfortune
nevertheless
the
moon
will
continue
her
course
and
the
days
of
the
week
will
be
nameless
what
does
it
matter
do
you
think
they
will
not
come
unless
you
call
them
or
that
once
passed
they
will
return
if
you
call
out
their
names
and
no
one
will
take
any
count
of
the
years
we
shall
be
able
to
say
we
are
young
when
we
are
old
and
we
shall
forget
our
cares
when
we
can
not
fix
their
anniversary
besides
when
we
are
very
old
we
shall
not
know
it
nor
be
expecting
death
daily
but
how
is
it
these
rogues
have
disappeared
some
killed
themselves
with
fighting
others
were
drowned
in
the
sea
some
ate
each
other
not
a
few
committed
suicide
some
died
of
ennui
in
idleness
and
some
turned
their
brains
with
study
debauch
and
a
thousand
other
excesses
put
an
end
to
many
more
in
short
they
have
arrived
at
their
end
by
endeavouring
as
long
as
they
lived
to
violate
the
laws
of
nature
and
to
go
contrary
to
their
welfare
still
i
do
not
understand
how
an
entire
race
of
animals
can
become
extinct
without
leaving
any
trace
behind
it
you
who
are
a
specialist
in
geology
ought
to
know
that
the
circumstance
is
not
a
new
one
and
that
many
kinds
of
animals
lived
anciently
which
are
nowhere
to
be
found
except
in
the
remains
of
a
few
petrified
bones
moreover
these
poor
creatures
employed
none
of
the
means
used
by
men
for
their
destruction
it
may
be
so
i
should
dearly
like
to
resuscitate
one
or
two
of
the
rascals
just
to
know
what
they
would
think
when
they
saw
all
going
on
as
before
in
spite
of
the
disappearance
of
the
human
race
would
they
then
imagine
that
everything
was
made
and
maintained
solely
for
them
they
would
not
like
to
realise
that
the
world
exists
solely
for
the
use
of
the
goblins
you
are
joking
my
friend
if
you
mean
what
you
say
why
of
course
i
do
go
along
with
you
buffoon
who
does
not
know
that
the
world
is
made
for
the
gnomes
for
the
gnomes
who
live
underground
that
is
one
of
the
best
jokes
i
have
ever
heard
what
good
are
the
sun
moon
air
sea
and
country
to
the
gnomes
and
pray
of
what
use
to
the
goblins
are
the
mines
of
gold
and
silver
and
the
whole
body
of
earth
except
the
outer
skin
well
well
suppose
we
abandon
the
discussion
it
is
unimportant
after
all
for
i
imagine
even
the
lizards
and
gnats
think
the
whole
world
was
created
for
their
exclusive
service
let
each
of
us
believe
what
we
please
for
nothing
will
make
us
change
our
opinion
but
between
ourselves
if
i
had
not
been
born
a
goblin
i
should
be
in
despair
and
i
had
i
not
been
born
a
gnome
but
i
should
like
to
know
what
men
would
say
of
their
impertinence
in
former
times
when
besides
other
misdeeds
they
sank
thousands
of
underground
shafts
and
stole
our
goods
from
us
by
force
asserting
that
they
belonged
to
the
human
race
nature
they
said
concealed
and
buried
the
things
down
below
as
a
sort
of
game
at
hide
and
seek
just
to
see
if
they
could
discover
and
abstract
them
i
do
not
wonder
at
that
since
they
not
only
imagined
the
things
of
the
world
were
at
their
service
but
they
also
regarded
them
as
a
mere
trifle
compared
to
the
human
race
they
called
their
own
vicissitudes
revolutions
of
the
world
and
histories
of
their
nations
histories
of
the
world
although
the
earth
contained
about
as
many
different
species
of
animals
as
living
individual
human
beings
yet
these
animals
though
made
expressly
for
the
use
of
men
were
never
conscious
of
the
revolutions
of
the
world
then
even
the
fleas
and
gnats
were
made
for
the
service
of
men
just
so
to
exercise
their
patience
men
said
as
if
apart
from
fleas
man
patience
were
not
tried
sufficiently
and
a
certain
man
named
chrysippus
termed
pigs
pieces
of
meat
expressly
prepared
by
nature
for
man
table
their
souls
he
said
served
the
purpose
of
salt
in
preserving
them
from
decay
in
my
opinion
if
chrysippus
had
had
a
little
sense
salt
in
his
brain
instead
of
imagination
soul
he
would
never
have
conceived
such
an
idea
here
is
another
amusing
circumstance
an
infinite
number
of
species
of
animals
were
never
seen
nor
heard
of
by
men
their
masters
either
because
they
lived
where
man
never
set
foot
or
because
they
were
too
small
to
be
observed
many
others
were
only
discovered
during
the
last
days
of
the
human
race
the
same
may
be
said
of
plants
minerals
similarly
from
time
to
time
by
means
of
their
telescopes
they
perceived
some
star
or
planet
of
the
existence
of
which
hitherto
during
thousands
and
thousands
of
years
they
had
been
ignorant
they
then
immediately
entered
it
on
the
catalogue
of
their
possessions
for
they
regarded
the
stars
and
planets
as
so
many
candles
placed
up
above
to
give
light
to
their
dominions
because
they
were
wont
to
transact
much
business
in
the
night
and
in
summer
when
they
saw
those
little
meteor
flames
that
rush
through
the
air
at
night
they
imagined
them
to
be
sprites
employed
in
snuffing
the
candles
for
the
good
of
mankind
yet
now
that
they
are
all
gone
the
earth
is
none
the
worse
off
the
rivers
still
flow
and
the
sea
although
no
longer
used
for
navigation
and
traffic
is
not
dried
up
the
stars
and
planets
still
rise
and
set
nor
have
they
gone
into
mourning
neither
has
the
sun
put
on
sackcloth
and
ashes
as
it
did
according
to
virgil
when
cæsar
died
about
whom
i
imagine
it
concerned
itself
as
little
as
pompey
pillar
between
malambruno
and
spirits
of
the
deep
farfarello
ciriatto
raconero
astarotte
alichino
or
whatever
else
you
are
called
i
adjure
you
in
the
name
of
beelzebub
and
command
you
by
virtue
of
my
art
which
can
unhinge
the
moon
and
nail
the
sun
in
the
midst
of
the
heavens
come
one
of
you
with
your
prince
permission
to
put
all
the
powers
of
hell
at
my
disposal
here
i
am
who
are
you
farfarello
at
thy
service
have
you
the
mandate
of
beelzebub
i
have
and
can
thus
do
for
thee
all
that
the
king
himself
could
do
and
more
than
lies
in
the
power
of
all
other
creatures
together
it
is
well
i
wish
to
be
satisfied
in
but
one
desire
thou
shalt
be
obeyed
what
is
it
dost
thou
wish
for
majesty
surpassing
that
of
the
atrides
no
more
wealth
than
shall
be
found
in
el
dorado
when
it
is
discovered
no
an
empire
as
large
as
that
of
which
charles
dreamt
one
night
no
a
mistress
chaster
than
penelope
no
methinks
the
devil
aid
were
superfluous
for
that
honours
and
success
however
wicked
thou
mayst
be
i
should
rather
more
need
the
devil
if
i
wished
the
contrary
under
such
circumstances
then
what
dost
thou
want
make
me
happy
for
a
moment
i
can
not
why
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
i
can
not
do
it
the
word
of
honour
of
a
good
demon
yes
to
be
sure
thou
shouldest
know
that
there
are
good
devils
as
well
as
good
men
and
you
must
know
that
i
will
hang
you
by
the
tail
to
one
of
these
beams
if
you
do
not
instantly
obey
me
without
more
words
it
were
easier
for
you
to
kill
me
than
for
me
to
satisfy
your
demands
then
return
with
my
malediction
and
let
beelzebub
come
himself
beelzebub
and
the
whole
army
of
hell
would
be
equally
powerless
to
render
you
or
any
of
your
race
happy
not
even
for
a
single
moment
as
impossible
for
a
moment
half
a
moment
or
the
thousandth
part
of
a
moment
as
for
a
lifetime
well
since
you
can
not
make
me
happy
in
any
way
at
least
free
me
from
unhappiness
on
condition
that
you
no
longer
love
yourself
above
everything
else
i
shall
only
cease
doing
that
when
i
die
but
as
long
as
you
live
you
will
be
unable
to
do
it
your
nature
would
tolerate
anything
rather
than
that
so
it
is
consequently
loving
yourself
above
everything
you
desire
your
own
happiness
more
than
anything
but
because
this
is
unattainable
you
must
necessarily
be
unhappy
even
when
engaged
in
pleasure
since
no
gratification
can
make
me
happy
or
satisfy
me
truly
none
and
because
pleasure
can
not
satisfy
my
soul
innate
desire
for
happiness
it
is
not
true
pleasure
and
during
its
continuance
i
shall
still
be
unhappy
as
you
say
because
in
men
and
other
living
beings
the
deprivation
of
happiness
even
though
pain
and
misfortune
be
wanting
implies
express
unhappiness
this
too
during
the
continuance
of
pleasures
so
that
from
birth
to
death
our
unhappiness
never
ceases
for
an
instant
yes
it
ceases
whenever
you
sleep
dreamlessly
or
when
from
one
cause
or
another
you
are
deprived
of
your
senses
but
never
so
long
as
we
are
sensible
that
we
live
never
so
that
in
fact
it
were
better
not
to
live
than
to
live
if
the
absence
of
unhappiness
be
better
than
unhappiness
itself
then
then
if
you
would
like
to
give
me
your
soul
before
its
time
i
am
ready
to
carry
it
away
with
me
between
nature
and
a
go
my
beloved
child
you
shall
be
regarded
as
my
favoured
one
for
very
many
centuries
live
be
great
and
unhappy
what
evil
have
i
done
before
beginning
to
live
that
you
condemn
me
to
this
misery
what
misery
my
child
do
you
not
ordain
that
i
am
to
be
unhappy
yes
but
only
so
far
as
to
enable
you
to
be
great
which
you
can
not
become
without
unhappiness
besides
you
are
destined
to
animate
a
human
body
and
all
men
are
of
necessity
unhappy
from
their
birth
it
were
more
reasonable
that
you
made
happiness
a
necessity
or
this
being
impossible
it
were
better
not
to
bring
men
into
the
world
i
can
do
neither
the
one
thing
nor
the
other
because
i
am
subordinate
to
destiny
who
decrees
the
contrary
the
reason
of
this
is
as
much
a
mystery
to
myself
as
to
you
now
that
you
are
created
and
designed
to
animate
a
human
being
no
power
in
the
world
can
save
you
from
the
unhappiness
common
to
men
moreover
your
infelicity
will
be
especially
great
owing
to
the
perfection
with
which
i
have
fashioned
you
i
know
nothing
yet
because
i
have
only
just
begun
to
live
doubtless
this
is
why
i
do
not
understand
you
but
tell
me
is
greatness
the
same
thing
as
extreme
unhappiness
if
however
they
are
different
why
could
not
the
one
be
separated
from
the
other
in
the
souls
of
men
and
proportionately
in
those
of
all
animals
they
are
inseparable
because
excellence
of
soul
implies
great
capacity
for
knowledge
which
in
exposing
to
men
the
unhappiness
of
humanity
may
be
termed
unhappiness
itself
similarly
a
life
of
greater
intensity
involves
a
greater
love
of
self
manifested
in
different
ways
an
increased
desire
for
happiness
is
a
consequence
of
this
and
increased
unhappiness
because
of
the
impossibility
of
satisfying
this
desire
and
as
the
unfortunate
condition
of
humanity
becomes
realised
all
this
is
decreed
from
the
beginning
of
creation
and
is
unalterable
by
me
moreover
the
keenness
of
your
intellect
and
the
strength
of
your
imagination
will
lessen
considerably
your
power
of
brute
animals
readily
adapt
all
their
faculties
and
powers
to
the
attainment
of
their
ends
but
men
rarely
do
so
being
usually
prevented
by
their
reason
and
imagination
which
give
birth
to
a
thousand
doubts
in
deliberation
and
a
thousand
hindrances
in
execution
the
less
men
are
inclined
or
accustomed
to
deliberate
the
more
prompt
are
they
in
decision
and
the
more
vigorous
in
action
but
such
souls
as
yours
and
proudly
conscious
of
their
greatness
are
really
powerless
for
and
often
succumb
to
irresolution
both
in
thought
and
action
this
temperament
is
one
of
the
greatest
curses
of
human
life
added
to
this
although
by
your
noble
talents
you
will
easily
and
quickly
excel
most
men
in
profound
knowledge
and
works
of
the
greatest
difficulty
you
will
yet
find
it
almost
impossible
to
learn
or
put
in
practice
a
host
of
things
trivial
enough
but
very
essential
for
your
intercourse
with
others
at
the
same
time
you
will
see
your
inferiors
and
even
men
of
scarcely
any
intelligence
perfectly
at
home
with
these
things
such
difficulties
and
miseries
as
these
occupy
and
surround
great
souls
but
they
are
amply
atoned
for
by
fame
praise
and
honours
paid
to
their
greatness
and
by
the
lasting
memory
they
leave
behind
them
whence
will
come
these
praises
and
honours
from
heaven
from
you
or
from
whom
from
men
who
alone
can
dispense
them
but
i
thought
my
ignorance
of
those
things
necessary
for
the
intercourse
of
life
which
intellects
inferior
to
mine
so
easily
comprehend
would
cause
me
to
be
despised
and
shunned
not
praised
by
men
i
thought
too
that
i
should
surely
live
unknown
to
most
of
them
because
of
my
unfitness
for
their
society
i
have
not
the
power
to
foresee
the
future
so
i
can
not
say
exactly
how
men
will
behave
to
you
whilst
you
are
on
earth
but
judging
from
past
experience
i
think
they
will
probably
be
jealous
of
you
this
is
another
misfortune
to
which
great
minds
are
peculiarly
liable
perhaps
too
they
will
despise
you
and
treat
you
with
indifference
fortune
herself
and
even
circumstances
are
usually
unfriendly
to
such
as
you
but
directly
after
your
death
as
happened
to
one
named
camoens
or
a
few
years
later
like
milton
you
will
be
eulogised
and
lauded
to
the
skies
if
not
by
every
one
at
any
rate
by
the
few
men
of
noble
minds
perhaps
the
ashes
of
your
body
will
be
deposited
in
a
magnificent
tomb
and
your
likeness
reproduced
in
many
different
forms
and
passed
about
from
hand
to
hand
men
will
also
study
your
life
and
writings
and
at
length
the
world
will
ring
with
your
name
always
provided
you
are
not
hindered
by
evil
fortune
or
even
by
the
very
excess
of
your
genius
from
leaving
undoubted
testimonies
of
your
merit
instances
are
not
wanting
of
such
unfortunates
known
only
to
myself
and
destiny
o
mother
i
care
not
if
i
be
deprived
of
all
knowledge
so
long
as
i
obtain
what
i
most
desire
happiness
and
as
for
glory
i
know
not
whether
it
be
a
good
or
evil
thing
but
i
do
know
that
i
shall
only
value
it
in
so
far
as
it
procures
me
happiness
directly
or
indirectly
now
on
your
own
showing
the
excellence
with
which
you
have
endowed
me
though
it
may
be
fruitful
of
glory
is
also
productive
of
the
greatest
unhappiness
yet
even
this
paltry
glory
i
may
not
gain
until
i
am
dead
when
i
fail
to
see
how
i
shall
benefit
by
it
and
besides
there
is
the
probability
that
this
phantom
glory
the
price
of
so
much
suffering
may
be
obtained
neither
in
life
nor
after
death
in
short
from
what
you
yourself
have
said
i
conclude
that
far
from
loving
me
with
peculiar
affection
as
you
affirmed
you
bear
me
greater
malice
than
that
of
which
i
can
be
the
victim
either
at
the
hands
of
men
or
destiny
why
else
should
you
have
endowed
me
with
this
disastrous
excellence
about
which
you
boast
so
much
and
which
will
be
the
chief
in
the
road
to
happiness
the
only
thing
for
which
i
care
my
child
all
men
are
destined
to
be
unhappy
as
i
have
said
without
any
fault
of
mine
but
in
the
midst
of
this
universal
misery
and
amid
the
infinite
vanity
of
all
their
pleasures
and
joys
glory
is
by
most
men
considered
to
be
the
greatest
good
of
life
and
the
worthiest
object
of
ambition
and
fatigue
therefore
not
hatred
but
a
feeling
of
especial
kindliness
has
prompted
me
to
assist
you
as
far
as
i
could
in
your
attainment
of
this
glory
tell
me
among
the
animals
you
mentioned
are
there
any
of
less
vitality
and
sensibility
than
men
all
are
so
in
more
or
less
degree
beginning
with
plants
man
being
the
most
perfect
of
them
all
has
greater
life
and
power
of
thought
than
all
other
living
beings
then
if
you
love
me
place
me
in
the
most
imperfect
thing
existing
or
that
being
impossible
at
least
deprive
me
of
this
terrible
excellence
and
make
me
like
the
most
stupid
and
senseless
soul
you
have
ever
created
i
can
satisfy
your
second
request
and
will
do
so
since
you
reject
the
immortality
i
would
have
given
you
and
instead
of
the
immortality
i
beseech
you
to
hasten
my
death
as
much
as
possible
i
will
consult
destiny
about
that
between
the
earth
and
the
dear
moon
i
know
that
you
can
speak
and
answer
questions
like
a
human
being
for
i
have
heard
so
from
many
of
the
poets
besides
our
children
say
you
have
really
a
mouth
nose
and
eyes
like
every
one
else
and
that
they
see
them
with
their
own
eyes
which
at
their
time
of
life
ought
to
be
very
sharp
as
for
me
no
doubt
you
know
that
i
am
a
person
indeed
when
i
was
young
i
had
a
number
of
children
so
you
will
not
be
surprised
to
hear
me
speak
and
the
reason
my
fine
moon
why
i
have
never
uttered
a
word
to
you
before
although
i
have
been
your
neighbour
for
i
do
know
how
many
centuries
is
that
i
have
been
so
occupied
as
to
have
no
time
for
gossip
but
now
my
business
is
so
trifling
that
it
can
look
after
itself
i
do
know
what
to
do
and
am
ready
to
die
of
ennui
so
in
future
i
hope
we
may
often
have
some
talk
together
and
i
should
like
to
know
all
about
your
affairs
if
it
does
not
inconvenience
you
to
recount
them
to
me
be
easy
on
that
score
may
the
fates
never
trouble
me
more
than
you
are
likely
to
talk
as
much
as
you
please
and
although
as
i
believe
you
know
i
am
partial
to
silence
i
will
willingly
listen
and
reply
to
oblige
you
do
you
hear
the
delightful
sound
made
by
the
heavenly
bodies
in
motion
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
hear
nothing
nor
do
i
save
only
the
whistling
of
the
wind
which
blows
from
my
poles
to
the
equator
and
from
the
equator
to
the
poles
and
which
is
far
from
musical
but
pythagoras
asserts
that
the
celestial
spheres
make
an
incredibly
sweet
harmony
and
that
you
take
part
in
the
concert
and
are
the
eighth
chord
of
this
universal
lyre
as
for
me
i
am
so
deafened
by
my
own
noise
that
i
hear
nothing
i
also
am
doubtless
deafened
since
i
hear
no
more
than
you
but
it
is
news
to
me
that
i
am
a
chord
now
let
us
change
the
subject
tell
me
are
you
really
inhabited
as
thousands
of
ancient
and
modern
philosophers
affirm
from
orpheus
to
de
lalande
in
spite
of
all
my
efforts
to
prolong
these
horns
of
mine
which
men
call
mountains
and
hills
and
from
the
summits
of
which
i
look
at
you
in
silence
i
have
failed
to
discern
a
single
one
of
your
inhabitants
yet
i
am
told
that
a
certain
david
fabricius
whose
eyes
were
keener
than
those
of
lynceus
at
one
time
observed
your
people
extending
their
linen
to
be
dried
by
the
sun
i
know
nothing
about
your
horns
i
will
admit
that
i
am
inhabited
what
colour
are
your
men
what
men
those
that
you
contain
did
you
not
say
you
were
inhabited
yes
what
then
does
it
not
follow
that
all
your
inhabitants
are
animals
neither
animals
nor
men
though
i
am
really
in
ignorance
as
to
the
nature
of
either
the
one
or
the
other
as
for
the
men
you
speak
of
i
have
not
an
idea
what
you
mean
then
what
sort
of
creatures
are
yours
they
are
of
very
many
different
kinds
as
unknown
to
you
as
yours
are
to
me
this
is
so
strange
that
if
you
yourself
had
not
informed
me
of
it
i
would
never
have
believed
it
were
you
ever
conquered
by
any
of
your
inhabitants
not
that
i
know
of
but
how
and
for
what
reason
through
ambition
and
jealousy
by
means
of
diplomacy
and
arms
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
by
arms
ambition
and
diplomacy
indeed
i
understand
nothing
of
what
you
say
but
surely
if
you
do
not
understand
the
meaning
of
arms
you
know
something
of
war
because
not
long
ago
a
certain
doctor
discovered
through
a
telescope
which
is
an
instrument
for
seeing
a
long
distance
that
you
possessed
a
fine
fortress
with
proper
bastions
now
this
is
certain
proof
that
your
races
are
at
any
rate
accustomed
to
sieges
and
mural
battles
pardon
me
mother
earth
if
i
reply
to
you
a
little
more
at
length
than
would
be
expected
from
one
so
subjugated
as
it
seems
i
am
but
in
truth
you
appear
to
me
more
than
vain
to
imagine
that
everything
in
the
world
is
conformable
to
your
things
as
if
nature
had
no
other
intention
than
to
copy
you
exactly
in
each
of
her
creations
i
tell
you
i
am
inhabited
and
you
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
my
inhabitants
are
men
i
assert
that
they
are
not
and
whilst
admitting
that
they
may
be
another
race
of
beings
you
endow
them
with
qualities
and
customs
similar
to
those
of
your
people
you
also
speak
to
me
about
the
telescope
of
a
certain
doctor
but
it
seems
to
me
the
sight
of
these
telescopes
is
about
as
good
as
that
of
your
children
who
discover
that
i
have
eyes
a
mouth
and
a
nose
all
of
which
i
am
ignorant
of
possessing
then
it
is
not
true
that
your
provinces
are
intersected
by
fine
long
roads
and
that
you
are
cultivated
which
things
are
clearly
discernible
with
a
telescope
from
germany
i
do
not
know
whether
i
am
cultivated
and
i
have
never
observed
my
roads
dear
moon
you
must
know
that
i
am
of
a
coarse
composition
and
very
no
wonder
therefore
that
men
easily
deceive
me
but
i
can
assure
you
that
if
your
own
inhabitants
do
not
care
to
conquer
you
you
are
by
no
means
free
from
such
danger
for
at
different
times
many
people
down
here
have
thought
of
subduing
you
and
have
even
made
great
preparations
for
doing
so
some
have
tried
to
reach
you
by
going
to
my
highest
places
standing
on
tiptoe
and
stretching
out
their
arms
besides
they
have
made
a
careful
study
of
your
surface
and
drawn
out
maps
of
your
countries
they
also
know
the
heights
of
your
mountains
and
even
their
names
i
warn
you
of
these
things
out
of
pure
goodwill
so
that
you
may
be
prepared
for
any
emergency
now
permit
me
to
ask
you
another
question
or
two
are
you
much
disturbed
by
the
dogs
that
bay
at
you
what
do
you
think
of
those
people
who
show
you
another
moon
in
a
well
are
you
masculine
or
feminine
because
anciently
there
was
a
difference
of
opinion
is
it
true
that
the
arcadians
came
into
the
world
before
you
are
your
women
or
whatever
i
should
call
them
oviparous
and
did
one
of
their
eggs
fall
down
to
us
once
upon
a
time
are
you
perforated
like
a
bead
as
a
modern
philosopher
believes
are
you
made
of
green
cheese
as
some
english
say
is
it
true
that
mahomet
one
fine
night
cut
you
in
two
like
a
water
melon
and
that
a
good
piece
of
your
body
fell
into
his
cloak
why
do
you
like
to
stay
on
the
tops
of
minarets
what
do
you
think
of
the
feast
of
bairam
you
may
as
well
go
on
i
need
not
answer
such
questions
nor
depart
from
my
accustomed
habit
of
silence
if
you
wish
to
be
so
frivolous
and
can
find
nothing
else
to
talk
to
me
about
except
matters
incomprehensible
to
me
your
people
had
better
construct
another
planet
to
rotate
round
them
which
they
can
design
and
populate
as
they
please
you
seem
unable
to
talk
of
anything
but
men
and
dogs
and
such
things
of
which
i
know
as
much
as
of
that
one
great
being
round
which
i
am
told
our
sun
turns
truly
the
more
i
determine
not
to
touch
on
personal
matters
the
less
i
succeed
in
my
resolution
but
for
the
future
i
will
be
more
careful
tell
me
do
you
amuse
yourself
by
drawing
up
my
and
then
letting
it
fall
again
it
may
be
but
if
i
have
done
this
or
other
such
things
i
am
unaware
of
it
and
you
it
seems
to
me
do
not
consider
what
you
effect
here
which
is
of
so
much
the
more
importance
as
your
size
and
strength
are
greater
than
mine
i
know
nothing
of
these
effects
except
that
from
time
to
time
i
deprive
you
of
the
sun
light
and
myself
of
yours
and
that
i
illumine
you
during
your
nights
as
is
sometimes
evident
to
me
but
i
am
forgetting
one
thing
which
is
the
most
important
of
all
i
should
like
to
know
if
ariosto
is
correct
in
saying
that
everything
man
loses
such
as
youth
beauty
health
the
vigour
and
money
spent
in
the
pursuit
of
glory
in
the
instruction
of
children
and
founding
or
promoting
useful
institutions
flies
to
you
so
that
you
possess
all
things
pertaining
to
man
except
folly
which
has
never
left
mankind
if
this
be
true
i
reckon
you
ought
to
be
so
full
as
to
have
scarcely
any
space
unoccupied
especially
since
men
have
recently
lost
a
great
many
things
such
as
patriotism
virtue
magnanimity
righteousness
not
merely
in
part
or
singly
as
in
former
times
but
completely
and
without
exception
and
certainly
if
you
have
not
got
these
things
i
do
not
know
where
else
they
can
be
but
supposing
you
have
them
i
wish
we
could
come
to
an
agreement
whereby
you
might
soon
return
the
lost
things
to
me
for
i
imagine
you
must
be
greatly
encumbered
especially
with
common
sense
which
i
understand
crowds
you
very
much
in
return
for
this
i
will
see
that
men
pay
you
annually
a
good
sum
of
money
men
again
though
folly
as
you
say
has
not
left
your
domains
you
wish
nevertheless
to
make
an
utter
fool
of
me
by
depriving
me
of
what
reason
i
possess
to
supply
the
deficiency
in
your
people
but
i
do
not
know
where
this
reason
of
yours
is
nor
whether
it
can
be
found
in
the
universe
i
know
well
that
it
is
not
here
any
more
than
the
other
things
you
mention
at
least
you
can
tell
me
if
your
inhabitants
are
acquainted
with
vices
misdeeds
misfortunes
suffering
and
old
age
in
short
evils
do
you
understand
these
names
yes
i
understand
these
well
enough
and
not
only
the
names
i
am
full
of
them
instead
of
the
other
things
which
are
the
more
numerous
among
your
people
virtues
or
vices
vices
by
a
long
way
does
pleasure
or
pain
predominate
pain
is
infinitely
more
prevalent
and
your
inhabitants
are
they
mostly
happy
or
unhappy
so
unhappy
that
i
would
not
exchange
my
lot
with
the
happiest
of
them
it
is
the
same
here
i
wonder
why
we
differ
so
much
in
other
things
yet
agree
in
this
i
am
also
like
you
in
shape
i
rotate
like
you
and
am
illumined
by
the
same
sun
it
is
no
more
wonderful
that
we
should
resemble
each
other
in
these
things
than
that
we
should
possess
common
failings
because
evil
is
as
common
to
all
the
planets
of
the
universe
or
at
least
of
the
solar
system
as
rotundity
movement
and
light
and
if
you
could
speak
loud
enough
for
uranus
or
saturn
or
any
other
planet
to
hear
you
and
were
to
ask
them
if
they
contained
unhappiness
and
whether
pleasure
or
pain
predominated
each
would
answer
as
i
have
done
i
speak
from
experience
for
i
have
already
questioned
venus
and
mercury
to
whom
i
am
now
and
then
nearer
than
you
i
have
also
asked
certain
comets
which
have
passed
by
me
they
all
replied
to
the
same
effect
i
firmly
believe
even
the
sun
and
every
star
would
make
the
same
response
still
i
am
very
hopeful
in
future
i
trust
men
will
permit
me
to
experience
much
happiness
hope
as
much
as
you
please
i
will
answer
for
it
you
may
hope
for
ever
ha
did
you
hear
that
these
men
and
animals
of
mine
are
making
an
uproar
it
is
night
on
the
side
from
which
i
am
speaking
to
you
and
at
first
they
were
all
asleep
but
thanks
to
our
conversation
they
are
now
wide
awake
and
very
frightened
and
here
on
the
other
side
you
see
it
is
day
yes
now
i
do
not
wish
to
terrify
my
people
or
interrupt
their
sleep
which
is
the
best
thing
they
possess
so
let
us
postpone
conversation
until
another
opportunity
adieu
and
to
you
adieu

wager
of
in
the
year
of
the
reign
of
jove
the
college
of
the
muses
caused
certain
notices
to
be
printed
and
affixed
in
the
public
places
of
the
city
and
suburbs
of
hypernephelus
these
notices
contained
an
invitation
to
all
the
gods
great
and
small
and
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
city
who
had
recently
or
anciently
originated
some
praiseworthy
invention
to
make
representation
thereof
either
actually
or
by
model
or
description
to
certain
judges
nominated
by
this
college
and
regretting
that
its
poverty
prevented
it
from
displaying
the
liberality
it
would
have
liked
to
show
the
college
promised
to
reward
the
one
whose
invention
should
be
judged
the
finest
or
most
useful
with
a
crown
of
laurel
in
addition
to
the
prize
itself
the
college
would
give
the
victor
permission
to
wear
the
crown
day
and
night
in
public
and
private
life
and
both
in
the
city
and
outside
it
he
might
also
be
painted
sculptured
or
modelled
in
any
manner
or
material
whatever
with
the
emblem
of
victory
on
his
brow
not
a
few
of
the
gods
contested
the
prize
simply
to
kill
time
a
thing
as
necessary
for
the
citizens
of
hypernephelus
as
for
the
people
of
other
towns
they
had
no
wish
for
the
crown
which
was
about
as
valuable
as
a
cotton
and
as
for
the
glory
if
even
men
despise
it
as
soon
as
they
become
philosophers
it
may
be
imagined
in
what
esteem
the
phantom
was
held
by
the
gods
who
are
so
much
wiser
than
the
wisest
of
men
if
indeed
they
are
not
the
sole
possessors
of
wisdom
as
pythagoras
and
plato
affirm
the
prize
was
awarded
with
an
unanimity
hitherto
unheard
of
in
cases
of
reward
bestowed
on
the
most
meritorious
neither
were
there
any
unfair
influences
exercised
such
as
favouritism
underhand
promises
or
artifice
three
competitors
were
chosen
bacchus
for
the
invention
of
wine
minerva
for
that
of
oil
with
which
the
gods
were
daily
wont
to
be
anointed
after
the
bath
and
vulcan
for
having
made
a
copper
pot
of
an
economical
design
by
which
cooking
could
be
expeditiously
conducted
with
but
little
fire
it
was
necessary
to
divide
the
prize
into
three
parts
so
there
only
remained
a
little
sprig
of
laurel
for
each
of
the
victors
but
they
all
three
declined
the
prize
whether
in
part
or
the
whole
vulcan
said
that
since
he
was
obliged
to
stand
the
greater
part
of
his
time
at
the
forge
fire
perspiring
and
considerably
exerting
himself
the
encumbrance
on
his
brow
would
be
a
great
annoyance
to
him
added
to
which
the
laurel
would
run
risk
of
being
scorched
or
burnt
if
some
spark
by
chance
were
to
fall
on
its
dry
leaves
and
set
it
on
fire
minerva
excused
herself
on
the
ground
of
having
to
wear
a
helmet
large
enough
as
homer
says
to
cover
the
united
armies
of
a
hundred
cities
consequently
any
increase
of
this
weight
would
be
very
inconvenient
and
out
of
the
question
bacchus
did
not
wish
to
change
his
mitre
and
chaplet
of
vine
leaves
for
the
laurel
which
however
he
would
willingly
have
accepted
had
he
been
allowed
to
put
it
up
as
a
sign
outside
his
tavern
but
the
muses
declined
to
grant
it
for
that
purpose
finally
the
wreath
remained
in
the
common
treasury
of
the
college
none
of
the
competitors
for
the
prize
envied
the
three
successful
gods
nor
did
they
express
vexation
at
the
award
nor
dispute
the
verdict
with
one
exception
prometheus
this
god
brought
to
the
contest
the
clay
model
he
had
used
in
the
formation
of
the
first
man
attached
to
the
model
was
some
writing
which
explained
the
qualities
and
office
of
the
human
race
his
invention
the
chagrin
displayed
by
prometheus
in
this
matter
caused
no
little
astonishment
since
all
the
other
gods
whether
victors
or
vanquished
had
regarded
the
whole
affair
as
a
joke
but
on
further
inquiry
it
transpired
that
what
he
especially
desired
was
not
the
honour
but
rather
the
privilege
accompanying
success
some
thought
he
meant
to
use
the
laurel
as
a
protection
for
his
head
against
storms
as
it
is
said
of
tiberius
that
whenever
he
heard
thunder
he
donned
his
crown
esteeming
the
laurel
proof
against
thunderbolts
but
this
suggestion
was
negatived
by
the
fact
that
the
city
of
hypernephelus
never
experienced
either
thunder
or
lightning
others
more
rationally
affirmed
that
prometheus
owing
to
age
had
begun
to
lose
his
hair
and
being
greatly
troubled
at
this
misadventure
as
are
many
mortals
in
similar
circumstances
and
either
not
having
read
synesius
eulogy
on
baldness
or
being
unconvinced
by
it
wished
like
julius
cæsar
to
hide
the
nakedness
of
his
head
beneath
the
leafy
diadem
but
to
turn
to
facts
one
day
prometheus
talking
with
momus
bitterly
complained
of
the
preference
given
to
the
wine
oil
and
in
comparison
with
the
human
race
which
he
said
was
the
finest
achievement
of
the
immortals
that
the
universe
had
ever
seen
and
not
being
able
sufficiently
to
convince
momus
who
gave
various
reasons
against
this
assertion
they
made
a
wager
on
the
subject
prometheus
proposed
that
they
should
descend
together
to
the
earth
and
alighting
by
chance
in
the
first
place
they
should
discover
inhabited
by
man
in
each
of
the
five
parts
of
the
world
they
might
find
out
whether
or
not
there
were
in
all
or
most
of
these
parts
conclusive
evidence
that
man
is
the
most
perfect
creature
of
the
universe
momus
accepted
the
wager
and
having
settled
the
amount
they
began
without
delay
to
descend
towards
the
earth
first
of
all
they
directed
themselves
to
the
new
world
which
from
its
name
and
the
fact
that
as
yet
none
of
the
immortals
had
set
foot
in
it
greatly
excited
their
curiosity
they
touched
ground
towards
the
north
of
popuyan
not
far
from
the
river
cauca
in
a
place
which
showed
many
signs
of
human
habitation
there
were
traces
of
cultivation
level
roads
broken
and
impassable
in
places
trees
cut
and
strewn
about
appearances
of
what
might
be
graves
and
here
and
there
human
bones
were
scattered
but
the
celestials
could
neither
hear
the
voice
nor
see
the
shadow
of
a
living
man
though
they
listened
acutely
and
looked
all
around
them
they
proceeded
walking
and
flying
for
the
distance
of
many
miles
passing
mountains
and
rivers
and
finding
everywhere
the
same
traces
of
human
habitation
and
the
same
solitude
how
is
it
these
countries
are
now
deserted
said
momus
to
prometheus
though
they
were
evidently
once
inhabited
prometheus
mentioned
the
inundations
of
the
sea
earthquakes
storms
and
heavy
rains
which
he
knew
were
ordinary
occurrences
in
the
tropics
indeed
as
if
in
confirmation
of
his
words
they
could
distinctly
hear
in
the
neighbouring
forests
the
incessant
patter
of
falling
from
the
branches
of
trees
agitated
by
the
wind
but
momus
was
unable
to
understand
how
that
locality
could
be
affected
by
inundations
of
the
sea
which
was
so
distant
as
not
to
be
visible
on
any
side
still
less
could
he
comprehend
why
the
earthquakes
storms
and
rains
should
have
destroyed
the
human
beings
of
the
country
sparing
however
the
jaguars
apes
ants
eagles
parrots
and
a
hundred
other
kinds
of
animals
and
birds
which
surrounded
them
at
length
descending
into
an
immense
valley
they
discovered
a
little
cluster
of
houses
or
wooden
cabins
covered
with
palm
leaves
and
environed
on
all
sides
by
a
fence
like
a
stockade
before
one
of
these
cabins
many
persons
some
standing
some
sitting
were
gathered
round
an
earthen
pot
suspended
over
a
large
fire
the
two
celestials
having
taken
human
form
drew
near
and
prometheus
courteously
saluting
them
all
turned
to
the
one
who
seemed
to
be
their
chief
and
asked
him
what
they
were
doing
eating
as
you
see
what
savoury
food
have
you
got
only
a
little
bit
of
meat
of
a
domestic
or
wild
animal
domestic
in
truth
since
it
is
my
own
son
what
had
you
then
like
pasiphaë
a
calf
for
your
son
not
a
calf
but
a
child
like
every
one
else
do
you
mean
what
you
say
is
it
your
own
flesh
and
blood
that
you
are
eating
my
own
no
but
certainly
that
of
my
son
why
else
did
i
bring
him
into
the
world
and
nourish
him
what
to
eat
him
why
not
and
i
will
also
eat
his
mother
when
she
can
have
no
more
children
as
one
eats
the
hen
after
her
eggs
and
i
will
likewise
eat
my
other
women
when
they
can
no
longer
have
children
and
why
also
should
i
keep
these
slaves
of
mine
alive
if
it
were
not
that
from
time
to
time
they
give
me
children
to
eat
but
when
they
are
old
i
will
eat
them
all
one
after
the
other
if
i
live
tell
me
do
these
slaves
belong
to
your
tribe
or
to
another
another
far
from
here
a
very
long
way
a
river
divides
their
huts
from
ours
and
pointing
with
his
finger
to
a
hillock
he
added
they
used
to
live
there
but
our
people
have
destroyed
their
dwellings
by
this
time
it
seemed
to
prometheus
that
many
of
the
savages
were
standing
looking
at
him
with
the
sort
of
appreciative
gaze
that
a
cat
gives
to
a
mouse
so
to
avoid
being
eaten
by
his
own
manufactures
he
rose
suddenly
on
the
wing
and
momus
followed
his
example
and
such
was
their
fright
that
in
setting
out
they
unconsciously
behaved
as
did
the
harpies
towards
the
trojans
when
at
meat
but
the
cannibals
more
hungry
or
less
dainty
than
the
companions
of
æneas
continued
their
horrid
repast
prometheus
very
dissatisfied
with
the
new
world
turned
immediately
towards
asia
the
older
one
having
traversed
almost
in
an
instant
the
space
which
lies
between
the
east
and
west
indies
they
both
descended
near
agra
in
a
field
where
they
saw
a
number
of
people
these
were
all
gathered
round
a
funeral
pyre
of
wood
by
which
men
with
torches
were
standing
ready
to
set
it
on
fire
and
on
a
platform
was
a
young
woman
very
sumptuously
attired
and
wearing
a
variety
of
barbaric
adornments
who
dancing
and
shouting
displayed
signs
of
the
liveliest
joy
prometheus
seeing
her
imagined
that
a
second
lucretia
or
virginia
or
some
imitator
of
the
children
of
erectheus
of
iphigenia
codrus
menecius
curtius
or
decius
was
about
to
sacrifice
herself
voluntarily
on
behalf
of
her
country
in
obedience
to
the
decree
of
some
oracle
learning
however
that
the
woman
was
about
to
die
because
her
husband
was
dead
he
supposed
that
like
alcestis
she
wished
at
the
cost
of
her
own
life
to
reanimate
her
husband
but
when
they
informed
him
that
she
was
only
induced
to
burn
herself
because
it
was
customary
for
widows
of
her
caste
to
do
so
and
that
she
had
always
hated
her
husband
that
she
was
drunk
and
that
the
dead
man
instead
of
being
resuscitated
was
to
be
burnt
in
the
same
fire
he
abruptly
turned
his
back
on
the
spectacle
and
set
out
for
europe
on
their
way
thither
prometheus
and
his
companion
held
the
following
conversation
did
you
think
when
at
so
great
a
hazard
you
stole
fire
from
heaven
to
give
to
men
that
some
of
them
would
make
use
of
it
to
cook
one
another
in
pots
and
others
voluntarily
to
burn
themselves
no
indeed
but
consider
dear
momus
that
the
men
we
have
hitherto
seen
are
barbarians
and
one
must
not
judge
of
human
nature
from
barbarians
but
rather
from
civilised
people
to
whom
we
are
now
going
i
have
a
strong
conviction
that
among
these
latter
we
shall
see
things
and
hear
words
which
will
astonish
as
much
as
delight
you
i
for
my
part
do
not
see
if
men
are
the
most
perfect
race
of
the
universe
why
they
need
be
civilised
in
order
not
to
burn
themselves
or
eat
their
own
children
other
animals
are
all
uncivilised
and
yet
none
of
them
deliberately
burn
themselves
except
the
phoenix
which
is
fabulous
rarely
they
eat
their
own
kind
and
much
more
rarely
make
food
of
their
own
offspring
by
any
chance
whatever
neither
do
they
specially
give
birth
to
them
for
that
purpose
i
also
understand
that
of
the
five
divisions
of
the
world
only
the
smallest
possesses
even
incompletely
the
civilisation
that
you
praise
to
this
may
be
added
minute
portions
of
other
parts
of
the
world
and
you
yourself
will
not
venture
to
assert
that
the
civilisation
of
the
present
day
is
such
that
the
men
of
paris
or
philadelphia
have
reached
the
highest
possible
state
of
perfection
yet
to
enable
them
to
attain
to
their
present
imperfect
state
of
civilisation
how
much
time
has
had
to
elapse
even
as
many
years
as
the
world
can
number
from
its
origin
to
the
existing
age
again
almost
all
the
inventions
which
have
been
of
greatest
use
or
importance
in
the
advancement
of
civilisation
have
originated
rather
fortuitously
than
rationally
hence
human
civilisation
is
a
work
of
chance
rather
than
nature
and
where
opportunity
has
been
lacking
the
people
are
still
barbarians
though
on
the
same
level
of
age
as
civilised
people
consequently
i
make
the
following
deductions
that
man
in
the
savage
state
is
many
degrees
inferior
to
every
other
animal
that
civilisation
as
compared
with
barbarism
is
only
possessed
even
in
the
present
day
by
a
small
portion
of
the
human
race
that
these
privileged
people
have
only
reached
their
existing
state
of
culture
after
the
lapse
of
many
ages
and
more
by
chance
than
anything
else
and
finally
that
the
present
state
of
civilisation
is
imperfect
consider
therefore
whether
your
opinion
about
the
human
race
would
not
be
better
expressed
in
saying
that
it
is
chief
among
races
but
supreme
rather
in
imperfection
than
perfection
it
does
not
affect
the
case
that
men
themselves
in
talking
and
reasoning
continually
confuse
perfection
and
imperfection
arguing
as
they
do
from
certain
preconceived
notions
which
they
take
for
palpable
truths
it
is
certain
that
the
other
races
of
creatures
were
each
from
the
very
beginning
in
a
state
of
perfection
and
since
it
is
clear
that
man
in
a
savage
state
compares
unfavourably
with
other
animals
i
do
not
understand
how
beings
naturally
the
most
imperfect
among
the
races
as
it
seems
men
are
come
to
be
esteemed
superior
to
all
others
added
to
which
human
civilisation
so
difficult
to
acquire
and
almost
impossible
to
perfect
is
not
so
immutable
that
it
can
not
relapse
in
fact
we
find
it
has
done
so
several
times
among
people
who
once
possessed
a
high
degree
of
culture
in
conclusion
i
think
your
brother
epimetheus
would
have
gained
the
prize
before
you
had
he
brought
to
the
judges
his
model
of
the
first
ass
or
first
frog
i
will
however
quite
agree
with
you
as
to
the
perfection
of
man
if
you
on
your
part
will
admit
that
his
excellence
is
of
the
kind
attributed
to
the
world
by
plotinus
this
philosopher
says
the
world
in
itself
is
supremely
perfect
but
containing
as
it
does
every
conceivable
evil
it
is
in
reality
as
bad
as
can
be
from
the
same
point
of
view
i
might
perhaps
agree
with
leibnitz
that
the
present
world
is
the
best
of
all
possible
worlds
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
prometheus
had
prepared
a
concise
and
crushing
reply
to
all
this
reasoning
but
it
is
very
certain
he
did
not
give
it
expression
for
just
then
they
found
themselves
over
the
city
of
london
the
gods
descended
and
seeing
a
great
many
people
rushing
to
the
door
of
a
private
house
they
mixed
with
the
crowd
and
entered
the
building
within
they
found
a
dead
man
who
had
been
shot
in
the
breast
laid
out
on
a
bed
he
had
a
pistol
clenched
in
his
right
hand
and
by
his
side
lay
two
children
also
dead
there
were
several
people
of
the
house
in
the
room
who
were
being
questioned
by
magistrates
while
an
official
wrote
down
their
replies
who
are
these
unfortunate
beings
my
master
and
his
children
who
has
killed
them
my
master
himself
what
do
you
mean
to
say
he
killed
his
children
and
himself
yes
alas
why
did
he
do
that
surely
some
great
misfortune
must
have
befallen
him
none
that
i
know
of
perhaps
he
was
poor
or
despised
by
every
one
unfortunate
in
love
or
in
disgrace
at
court
on
the
contrary
he
was
very
rich
and
i
believe
universally
esteemed
he
cared
nothing
about
love
and
was
in
high
favour
at
court
then
why
has
he
done
this
thing
he
was
weary
of
life
so
he
says
in
the
writing
he
has
left
what
are
these
judges
doing
taking
evidence
as
to
whether
my
master
was
out
of
his
mind
or
not
unless
he
is
proved
to
have
been
insane
his
goods
fall
to
the
crown
by
law
and
really
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
their
so
doing
but
had
he
no
friend
or
relative
to
whom
he
could
entrust
his
children
instead
of
killing
them
yes
he
had
and
especially
one
friend
to
whom
he
has
commended
his
dog
momus
was
about
to
congratulate
prometheus
on
the
good
effects
of
civilisation
and
the
happiness
that
seemed
to
be
inseparable
from
human
life
he
wished
also
to
remind
him
that
no
animal
except
man
voluntarily
killed
itself
or
was
impelled
by
feelings
of
despair
to
take
the
life
of
its
own
offspring
but
prometheus
anticipated
him
and
paid
the
bet
at
once
without
visiting
the
two
remaining
parts
of
the
world

a

philosopher
and
a
eureka
eureka
what
is
it
what
have
you
found
the
art
of
long
life
and
the
book
that
you
carry
explains
my
theory
this
invention
of
mine
will
give
me
eternal
life
others
may
live
long
but
i
shall
live
for
ever
i
mean
that
i
shall
acquire
immortal
fame
follow
my
advice
get
a
leaden
casket
enclose
therein
your
book
bury
it
and
leave
in
your
will
directions
where
it
may
be
found
with
instructions
to
your
heirs
not
to
exhume
the
book
until
they
shall
have
discovered
the
art
of
living
a
happy
life
and
meanwhile
meanwhile
your
invention
will
be
good
for
nothing
it
were
far
better
if
it
taught
the
art
of
living
briefly
that
has
already
been
known
a
long
time
the
discovery
was
not
a
difficult
one
at
any
rate
i
prefer
it
to
yours
why
because
if
life
be
not
happy
as
hitherto
it
has
not
been
it
were
better
to
endure
a
short
term
of
it
than
a
long
one
no
no
i
differ
from
you
life
is
a
good
in
itself
and
is
naturally
desired
and
loved
by
every
one
so
men
think
but
they
are
deceived
similarly
people
deceive
themselves
in
thinking
that
colours
are
attributes
of
the
objects
coloured
whereas
really
they
are
not
qualities
of
objects
but
of
light
i
assert
that
man
loves
and
desires
nothing
but
his
own
happiness
he
therefore
loves
his
life
only
inasmuch
as
he
esteems
it
the
instrument
or
subject
of
his
happiness
hence
it
is
happiness
that
he
always
loves
and
not
life
although
he
very
often
attributes
to
the
one
the
affection
he
has
for
the
other
it
is
true
that
this
illusion
and
that
relating
to
colours
are
both
natural
but
as
a
proof
that
the
love
of
life
in
men
is
unnatural
or
rather
unnecessary
think
of
the
many
people
that
in
olden
times
preferred
to
die
rather
than
live
in
our
own
time
too
many
people
often
wish
for
death
and
some
kill
themselves
now
such
things
could
not
occur
if
man
naturally
loved
life
itself
the
love
of
happiness
on
the
contrary
is
innate
in
every
living
being
indeed
the
world
would
perish
before
they
ceased
loving
and
seeking
it
in
every
possible
form
and
as
for
your
assertion
that
life
in
itself
is
a
good
thing
i
challenge
you
to
prove
your
words
by
any
arguments
you
please
whether
of
physics
or
metaphysics
personally
i
am
of
opinion
that
a
happy
life
is
undoubtedly
a
good
thing
but
this
is
because
of
the
happiness
not
the
life
an
unhappy
life
is
therefore
an
evil
and
since
it
is
ordained
that
human
life
should
be
inseparable
from
unhappiness
i
leave
you
to
draw
your
own
conclusions
let
us
drop
the
subject
if
you
please
it
is
too
melancholy
answer
me
one
question
candidly
and
without
such
subtleties
if
man
had
the
power
to
live
for
ever
i
mean
in
this
life
and
not
after
death
do
you
think
he
would
be
happy
allow
me
to
answer
you
by
a
fable
moreover
as
i
have
never
tasted
immortality
i
can
not
reply
to
you
from
experience
besides
i
have
never
by
any
chance
met
an
immortal
the
very
existence
of
whom
is
a
mere
matter
of
legend
if
cagliostro
were
alive
he
could
perhaps
enlighten
you
since
he
was
said
to
have
lived
for
several
centuries
but
he
is
now
dead
like
his
contemporaries
to
return
to
the
fable
the
wise
chiro
who
was
a
god
in
time
became
so
wearied
of
his
life
that
he
asked
permission
from
jove
to
die
this
was
granted
to
him
so
he
died
if
immortality
wrought
such
an
effect
on
the
gods
how
would
it
be
with
men
the
hyperboreans
an
unknown
but
famous
people
whose
country
is
inaccessible
by
sea
or
land
were
it
is
said
rich
in
all
manner
of
things
and
possessed
a
race
of
asses
of
peculiar
beauty
which
they
used
to
offer
as
sacrifices
they
had
the
power
unless
i
am
mistaken
of
living
for
ever
and
knew
nothing
of
fatigues
cares
wars
discords
or
crimes
yet
we
learn
that
after
several
thousand
years
of
life
they
all
killed
themselves
by
jumping
from
a
certain
rock
into
the
sea
where
they
were
drowned
here
is
another
legend
the
brothers
biton
and
cleobus
at
a
festival
when
the
mules
were
not
ready
attached
themselves
to
the
chariot
of
their
mother
who
was
a
priestess
of
juno
and
drew
her
to
the
temple
touched
by
their
devotion
the
priestess
asked
juno
to
reward
her
sons
for
their
piety
by
the
greatest
gift
possible
for
men
to
receive
the
goddess
caused
them
both
to
die
peacefully
within
an
hour
instead
of
giving
them
immortality
as
they
had
expected
the
same
happened
to
agamede
and
trophonius
when
these
two
men
had
finished
the
temple
of
delphi
they
begged
apollo
to
reward
them
the
god
asked
them
to
wait
seven
days
at
the
end
of
which
time
he
would
do
so
on
the
seventh
night
he
sent
them
a
sweet
sleep
from
which
they
have
never
awakened
they
are
so
satisfied
with
their
recompense
that
they
have
asked
nothing
more
on
the
subject
of
legends
here
is
one
which
introduces
a
question
i
would
have
you
answer
i
know
that
by
you
and
your
colleagues
human
life
is
generally
considered
to
be
as
a
rule
of
an
uniformly
average
duration
this
in
all
countries
and
under
all
climates
but
pliny
relates
that
the
men
of
some
parts
of
india
and
ethiopia
do
not
exceed
the
age
of
forty
years
they
who
die
at
this
age
are
considered
very
old
their
children
marry
at
seven
years
of
age
and
this
statement
is
verified
by
the
custom
in
guinea
the
deccan
and
elsewhere
in
the
torrid
zone
now
regarding
it
as
true
that
these
people
do
not
live
more
than
forty
years
and
this
as
a
natural
limit
and
not
due
to
artificial
circumstances
i
ask
you
whether
you
imagine
their
lot
ought
to
be
considered
more
or
less
happy
than
that
of
others
undoubtedly
more
miserable
since
they
die
so
soon
i
am
of
the
contrary
opinion
for
the
very
same
reason
but
that
does
not
matter
give
me
your
attention
for
a
moment
i
deny
that
life
itself
the
mere
sensation
of
existence
has
anything
pleasurable
or
desirable
in
its
nature
but
we
all
wish
for
the
other
thing
also
called
life
i
mean
strength
and
numerous
sensations
thus
all
activity
and
every
strong
and
lively
passion
provided
it
be
neither
disagreeable
nor
painful
pleases
us
simply
because
it
is
strong
and
lively
although
it
possess
no
other
pleasurable
attributes
now
these
men
whose
life
normally
lasts
only
forty
years
that
is
half
the
time
granted
by
nature
to
other
men
would
experience
every
moment
an
intensity
of
life
twice
as
strong
as
ours
because
their
growth
maturity
and
decline
are
accomplished
twice
as
rapidly
as
with
us
their
energy
of
life
therefore
ought
to
be
twice
as
intense
as
ours
at
every
moment
of
their
existence
and
to
this
greater
intensity
there
must
correspond
a
more
lively
activity
of
the
will
more
vivacity
and
animation
thus
they
experience
in
less
time
the
same
quantity
of
life
as
we
have
and
the
fewer
years
that
these
favoured
people
spend
on
the
earth
are
so
well
filled
that
there
is
no
sensible
vacuum
whereas
this
same
quantity
of
life
is
insufficient
to
vivify
a
term
twice
as
long
their
actions
and
sensations
diffused
over
so
limited
a
space
can
duly
occupy
all
their
existence
but
our
longer
life
is
constantly
divided
by
protracted
intervals
devoid
of
all
activity
and
lively
passion
and
since
existence
itself
is
in
no
sense
desirable
but
only
in
so
far
as
it
is
happy
and
since
good
or
evil
fortune
is
not
measurable
by
the
number
of
our
days
i
conclude
that
the
life
of
these
people
though
shorter
than
ours
is
much
the
richer
in
pleasures
or
what
are
so
called
their
life
must
then
be
preferable
to
ours
or
even
to
that
of
the
earliest
kings
of
assyria
egypt
china
india
and
other
countries
who
are
said
to
have
lived
thousands
of
years
so
that
far
from
being
desirous
of
immortality
i
am
content
to
leave
it
to
fishes
which
are
by
leeuwenhoek
believed
to
be
immortal
provided
they
are
neither
eaten
by
us
nor
their
fellows
instead
of
delaying
the
development
of
the
body
in
order
to
lengthen
life
as
maupertuis
proposed
i
would
rather
accelerate
it
until
the
duration
of
our
life
was
as
short
as
that
of
the
insects
called
ephemerals
which
insects
although
the
most
aged
does
not
live
beyond
a
single
day
nevertheless
preside
over
three
generations
before
they
die
if
it
were
so
then
there
would
at
least
be
no
time
for
ennui
what
do
you
think
of
my
reasoning
it
does
not
persuade
me
i
know
that
you
love
metaphysics
whereas
i
for
my
part
hold
to
physics
to
your
subtleties
i
oppose
simple
common
sense
which
is
sufficient
for
me
thus
i
venture
to
assert
without
appealing
to
the
microscope
that
life
is
better
than
death
judging
between
the
two
i
would
give
the
apple
to
the
former
without
troubling
them
to
strip
for
the
contest
and
i
would
do
the
same
but
when
i
call
to
mind
the
custom
of
those
barbarians
who
for
every
unhappy
day
of
their
lives
used
to
throw
a
black
stone
into
a
quiver
and
for
every
happy
day
a
white
one
i
can
not
help
thinking
how
few
white
stones
compared
to
the
black
ones
would
be
found
therein
on
the
death
of
the
proprietor
of
the
quiver
personally
i
should
like
to
have
now
all
the
stones
representing
the
days
of
life
yet
remaining
to
me
and
permission
to
separate
them
throwing
away
black
ones
and
retaining
only
those
that
were
white
even
though
the
number
of
the
latter
was
exceedingly
small
and
their
colour
a
doubtful
white
many
people
on
the
contrary
would
be
glad
to
increase
the
number
of
their
black
stones
even
though
they
were
blacker
than
they
naturally
would
be
because
they
always
in
their
minds
dread
the
last
as
the
blackest
of
all
and
such
people
of
whom
i
am
one
will
really
be
able
to
add
many
stones
to
their
normal
quantity
if
they
follow
out
the
instructions
contained
in
my
book
every
one
thinks
and
works
in
his
own
way
death
also
will
not
fail
to
do
the
same
but
if
you
wish
in
prolonging
man
life
really
to
be
of
service
to
him
discover
an
art
to
increase
the
number
and
strength
of
sensations
and
their
effects
this
would
be
a
genuine
augmentation
of
human
life
for
it
would
fill
up
those
long
intervals
of
time
during
which
we
vegetate
rather
than
live
you
could
then
boast
of
having
truly
prolonged
human
life
and
without
having
sought
after
the
impossible
or
used
violence
to
natural
laws
rather
by
having
strengthened
them
for
does
it
not
seem
as
though
the
ancients
were
more
full
of
life
than
we
are
in
spite
of
the
many
and
great
dangers
by
which
they
were
surrounded
and
which
generally
shortened
their
existence
you
will
thus
render
a
real
service
to
man
whose
life
is
i
will
not
say
more
happy
but
certainly
less
unhappy
when
it
is
better
occupied
and
more
violently
agitated
without
pain
or
discomfort
when
on
the
other
hand
existence
is
so
full
of
idleness
and
ennui
as
to
be
justly
termed
empty
the
saying
of
pyrrhus
there
is
no
difference
between
life
and
death
is
literally
realised
were
this
saying
true
i
should
be
in
no
slight
terror
of
death
but
finally
unless
life
be
active
and
vigorous
it
is
not
true
life
and
death
is
far
preferable
to
it

somehow
your

and

always
do
me
good
come
and
sit
down
by
me
how
can
i
sit
such
a
thing
is
not
easy
for
a
spirit
but
what
does
it
matter
consider
that
i
am
seated
oh
that
i
could
see
my
leonora
again
whenever
i
think
of
her
i
feel
a
thrill
of
joy
that
reaches
from
the
crown
of
my
head
to
the
extremity
of
my
feet
and
all
my
nerves
and
veins
are
pervaded
with
it
my
mind
too
becomes
inflamed
with
certain
imaginings
and
longings
that
seem
for
the
time
to
transform
me
i
can
not
think
that
i
am
the
torquato
who
has
experienced
so
much
misfortune
and
i
often
mourn
for
myself
as
though
i
were
dead
truly
it
would
seem
that
worldly
friction
and
suffering
are
wont
to
overwhelm
and
lethargise
our
first
nature
within
each
of
us
this
from
time
to
time
awakens
for
a
brief
space
but
less
frequently
as
we
grow
older
when
it
always
withdraws
and
falls
into
an
increasingly
sound
sleep
finally
it
dies
although
our
life
still
continues
in
short
i
marvel
how
the
thought
of
a
woman
should
have
sufficient
power
to
rejuvenate
the
mind
and
make
it
forget
so
many
troubles
had
i
not
lost
all
hope
of
seeing
leonora
again
i
could
almost
believe
i
might
still
succeed
in
being
happy
which
do
you
consider
the
more
delightful
to
see
the
dear
woman
or
to
think
of
her
i
do
not
know
it
is
true
when
near
me
she
seemed
only
a
woman
at
a
distance
however
she
was
like
a
goddess
these
goddesses
are
so
amiable
that
when
one
approaches
you
she
instantaneously
puts
off
her
divinity
and
pockets
her
halo
of
greatness
for
fear
of
dazzling
the
mortal
to
whom
she
appears
there
is
only
too
much
truth
in
what
you
say
but
do
you
not
think
it
is
a
great
failing
in
women
that
they
prove
really
to
be
so
very
different
from
what
we
imagine
i
scarcely
think
it
is
their
fault
that
they
are
like
us
made
of
flesh
and
blood
instead
of
ambrosia
and
nectar
what
in
the
world
has
a
thousandth
part
of
the
perfection
with
which
your
fancy
endows
women
it
surprises
me
that
you
are
not
astonished
to
find
that
men
are
men
that
is
creatures
of
little
merit
and
amiability
since
you
can
not
understand
why
women
are
not
really
angels
in
spite
of
all
this
i
am
dying
to
see
her
again
compose
yourself
this
very
night
you
shall
dream
of
her
i
will
lead
her
to
you
beautiful
as
youth
and
so
kindly
disposed
that
you
will
be
encouraged
to
speak
to
her
much
more
freely
and
readily
than
in
former
times
you
will
be
induced
at
length
to
take
her
by
the
hand
and
she
looking
intently
at
you
will
surfeit
your
soul
with
sweetness
and
whenever
you
think
of
the
dream
your
heart
will
overflow
with
affection
what
a
consolation
a
dream
instead
of
the
truth
what
is
truth
i
am
as
ignorant
on
the
subject
as
pilate
was
well
i
will
tell
you
between
truth
or
reality
and
a
dream
there
is
this
difference
the
latter
is
much
the
finer
thing
of
the
two
what
the
pleasure
of
a
dream
worth
more
than
a
real
pleasure
it
is
as
an
instance
i
know
a
man
who
studiously
avoids
meeting
his
sweetheart
the
following
day
after
she
has
appeared
to
him
in
a
dream
he
knows
full
well
that
he
would
not
find
in
her
all
the
charms
with
which
she
was
endowed
in
the
dream
and
that
reality
dispelling
the
illusion
would
deprive
him
of
the
pleasure
he
felt
the
ancients
too
who
were
much
more
diligent
and
skilful
in
their
search
after
all
the
enjoyments
possible
for
man
to
have
did
wisely
in
endeavouring
by
various
means
to
realise
the
sweetness
and
pleasure
of
dreams
pythagoras
also
was
right
when
he
forbad
the
eating
of
beans
for
supper
these
vegetables
producing
a
dreamless
or
troubled
sleep
i
could
also
find
excuse
for
those
superstitious
people
who
were
wont
before
going
to
bed
to
invoke
the
aid
of
mercury
the
president
of
dreams
they
offered
sacrifice
to
him
that
he
might
grant
them
happy
dreams
and
used
to
keep
an
image
of
the
god
at
the
foot
of
their
bed
thus
it
was
that
being
unable
to
procure
any
happiness
during
the
day
people
sought
it
in
the
i
am
of
opinion
that
they
were
in
a
measure
successful
and
that
mercury
paid
more
attention
to
their
prayers
than
was
the
custom
of
the
other
gods
but
since
men
live
for
nothing
but
pleasure
whether
of
mind
or
body
if
this
pleasure
can
only
be
found
when
we
dream
it
follows
that
we
live
for
no
other
purpose
but
to
dream
now
i
really
can
not
admit
that
you
already
admit
it
inasmuch
as
you
live
and
are
willing
to
live
but
what
is
pleasure
my
acquaintance
with
it
is
too
slight
to
enable
me
to
answer
you
no
one
has
any
real
acquaintance
with
it
because
pleasure
is
not
a
reality
but
a
conception
it
is
a
desire
not
a
fact
a
sentiment
imagined
not
experienced
or
better
it
is
a
conception
and
not
a
sentiment
at
all
do
you
not
perceive
that
even
in
the
very
moment
of
enjoyment
however
ardently
it
may
have
been
longed
for
or
painfully
acquired
your
mind
not
deriving
complete
satisfaction
from
the
happiness
anticipates
at
some
future
time
a
greater
and
more
complete
enjoyment
it
is
expectation
that
constitutes
pleasure
thus
you
never
weary
of
placing
reliance
on
some
pleasure
of
the
future
which
melts
away
just
when
you
expect
to
enjoy
it
the
truth
is
you
possess
nothing
but
the
hope
of
a
more
complete
enjoyment
at
some
other
time
and
the
satisfaction
of
imagining
that
you
have
had
some
enjoyment
and
of
talking
about
it
to
others
less
because
you
are
vain
than
to
persuade
yourself
that
the
illusion
is
a
reality
hence
everyone
that
consents
to
live
makes
this
fugitive
dream
his
aim
in
life
he
believes
in
the
reality
of
past
and
future
enjoyment
both
of
which
beliefs
are
false
and
fanciful
then
is
it
impossible
for
a
man
to
believe
that
he
is
actually
happy
if
such
a
belief
were
possible
his
happiness
would
be
genuine
but
tell
me
do
you
ever
remember
having
been
able
at
any
moment
in
your
life
to
say
sincerely
i
am
happy
doubtless
you
have
daily
been
able
to
say
and
have
said
in
all
sincerity
i
shall
be
happy
and
often
too
though
less
sincerely
i
have
been
happy
thus
pleasure
is
always
either
a
thing
of
the
past
or
the
future
never
the
present
you
may
as
well
say
it
is
so
it
seems
even
in
dreams
even
in
dreams
considering
pleasure
in
its
true
sense
and
yet
pleasure
is
the
sole
object
and
aim
of
life
by
the
term
pleasure
i
mean
the
happiness
which
ought
to
be
a
consequence
of
pleasure
assuredly
then
our
life
being
deprived
of
its
real
aim
must
always
be
imperfect
and
existence
itself
unnatural
perhaps
there
is
no
perhaps
in
the
matter
but
why
is
it
that
we
live
i
mean
why
do
we
consent
to
live
how
should
i
know
you
yourselves
ought
to
know
better
than
i
i
assure
you
i
do
not
know
ask
some
one
wiser
than
yourself
perhaps
he
may
be
able
to
satisfy
you
i
will
do
so
but
certainly
the
life
that
i
lead
is
an
unnatural
state
because
apart
from
my
sufferings
ennui
alone
murders
me
what
is
ennui
as
to
this
i
can
answer
from
experience
ennui
seems
to
me
of
the
nature
of
atmosphere
which
fills
up
the
spaces
between
material
bodies
and
also
the
voids
in
the
bodies
themselves
whenever
a
body
disappears
and
is
not
replaced
by
another
air
fills
up
the
gap
immediately
so
too
in
human
life
the
intervals
between
pleasures
and
pains
are
occupied
by
ennui
and
since
in
the
material
world
according
to
the
peripatetics
there
can
be
no
vacuum
so
also
in
our
life
there
is
none
save
when
for
some
cause
or
other
the
mind
loses
its
power
of
thought
at
all
other
times
the
mind
considered
as
a
separate
identity
from
the
body
is
occupied
with
some
sentiment
if
void
of
pleasure
or
pain
it
is
full
of
ennui
for
this
last
is
also
a
sentiment
like
pleasure
and
pain
and
since
all
your
pleasures
are
like
cobwebs
exceedingly
fragile
thin
and
transparent
ennui
penetrates
their
tissue
and
saturates
them
just
as
air
penetrates
the

i
believe
ennui
is
really
nothing
but
the
desire
of
happiness
without
the
illusion
of
pleasure
and
the
suffering
of
pain
this
desire
we
have
said
is
never
completely
satisfied
since
true
pleasure
does
not
exist
so
that
human
life
may
be
said
to
be
interwoven
with
pain
and
ennui
and
one
of
these
sentiments
disappears
only
to
give
place
to
the
other
this
is
the
fate
of
all
men
and
not
of
yourself
alone
what
remedy
is
there
for
ennui
sleep
opium
and
pain
the
last
is
the
best
of
the
three
because
he
who
suffers
never
experiences
ennui
i
would
rather
submit
to
ennui
for
the
rest
of
my
life
than
take
such
medicine
but
its
force
and
strength
may
be
diminished
by
action
work
and
even
other
sentiments
though
these
do
not
entirely
free
us
from
ennui
since
they
are
unable
to
give
us
real
pleasure
here
in
prison
however
deprived
of
human
society
without
even
the
means
of
writing
reduced
for
an
amusement
to
counting
the
ticks
of
the
clock
looking
at
the
beams
cracks
and
nails
of
the
ceiling
thinking
about
the
pavement
stones
and
watching
the
gnats
and
flies
which
flit
across
my
cell
i
have
nothing
to
relieve
for
a
moment
my
burden
of
ennui
how
long
have
you
been
reduced
to
this
kind
of
life
for
many
weeks
as
you
know
have
you
felt
no
variation
in
the
ennui
which
oppresses
you
from
the
first
day
until
now
yes
i
felt
it
more
at
first
gradually
my
mind
is
becoming
accustomed
to
its
own
society
i
derive
more
and
more
pleasure
from
my
solitude
and
by
practice
i
am
acquiring
so
great
a
readiness
in
conversation
or
rather
chattering
to
myself
that
i
seem
to
have
in
my
head
a
company
of
talkative
people
and
the
most
trifling
object
is
now
sufficient
to
give
rise
to
endless
discourse
this
habit
will
grow
on
you
daily
to
such
an
extent
that
when
you
are
free
you
will
feel
more
idle
in
society
than
in
solitude
custom
has
made
you
bear
patiently
your
kind
of
life
and
the
same
influence
works
not
only
in
people
who
meditate
like
you
but
in
everyone
besides
the
very
fact
that
you
are
separated
from
men
and
even
it
may
be
said
from
life
itself
will
be
of
some
advantage
to
you
disgusted
and
wearied
with
human
affairs
as
you
are
from
your
sad
experience
you
will
in
time
begin
to
look
on
them
from
a
distance
with
an
appreciative
eye
in
your
solitude
they
will
appear
to
you
more
beautiful
and
worthy
of
affection
you
will
forget
their
vanity
and
misery
and
will
take
upon
yourself
to
the
world
as
you
would
have
it
consequently
you
will
value
desire
and
love
life
and
provided
there
be
the
possibility
or
certainty
of
your
return
to
human
society
some
day
your
new
aspect
of
life
will
fill
and
gladden
your
mind
with
a
joy
like
that
of
childhood
solitude
does
indeed
sometimes
act
like
a
second
youth
it
rejuvenates
the
soul
revives
the
imagination
and
renews
in
an
experienced
man
those
impressions
of
early
innocence
that
you
so
ardently
desire
but
your
eyes
seem
heavy
with
sleep
i
will
now
therefore
leave
you
to
prepare
the
fine
dream
i
promised
you
thus
between
dreams
and
fancies
your
life
shall
pass
without
other
gain
than
the
fact
of
its
passing
which
is
the
sole
benefit
of
life
to
hasten
it
should
be
the
one
aim
of
your
existence
you
are
often
obliged
to
cling
to
life
as
it
were
with
your
teeth
happy
will
be
the
day
when
death
releases
you
from
the
struggle
but
after
all
time
passes
as
tediously
with
your
persecutor
in
his
palace
and
gardens
as
with
you
in
your
prison
chamber
adieu
adieu
yet
stay
a
moment
your
conversation
always
enlivens
me
it
does
not
draw
me
from
my
sadness
but
my
mind
which
is
generally
comparable
to
a
dark
night
moonless
and
starless
changes
when
you
are
near
to
a
condition
like
that
of
a
grey
dawn
pleasurable
rather
than
otherwise
now
tell
me
how
i
can
find
you
in
case
i
want
you
at
some
future
time
do
you
not
yet
know
in
any
generous
liquor

tasso

apollonius
cap
between
nature
and
an
an
icelander
who
had
travelled
over
most
of
the
earth
and
had
lived
in
very
many
different
lands
found
himself
one
day
in
the
heart
of
africa
as
he
crossed
the
equator
in
a
place
never
before
penetrated
by
man
he
had
an
adventure
like
that
which
happened
to
vasco
di
gama
who
when
passing
the
cape
of
good
hope
was
opposed
by
two
giants
the
guardians
of
the
southern
seas
that
tried
to
prevent
his
entrance
into
the
new
waters
the
icelander
saw
in
the
distance
a
huge
bust
in
appearance
like
the
colossal
hermes
he
had
formerly
seen
in
the
isle
of
pasqua
at
first
he
thought
it
was
made
of
stone
but
as
he
drew
near
to
it
he
saw
that
the
head
belonged
to
an
enormous
woman
who
was
seated
on
the
ground
resting
her
back
against
a
mountain
the
figure
was
alive
and
had
a
countenance
both
magnificent
and
terrible
and
eyes
and
hair
of
a
jet
black
colour
she
looked
fixedly
at
him
for
a
long
time
in
silence
at
length
she
said
who
art
thou
what
doest
thou
here
where
thy
race
is
unknown
i
am
a
poor
icelander
fleeing
from
nature
i
have
fled
from
her
ever
since
i
was
a
child
through
a
hundred
different
parts
of
the
world
and
i
am
fleeing
from
her
now
so
flees
the
squirrel
from
the
rattlesnake
and
runs
in
its
haste
deliberately
into
the
mouth
of
its
tormentor
i
am
that
from
which
thou
fleest
nature
even
so
i
am
smitten
with
anguish
for
i
consider
no
worse
misfortune
could
befall
me
thou
mightest
well
have
imagined
that
i
was
to
be
found
in
countries
where
my
power
is
supremest
but
why
dost
thou
shun
me
you
must
know
that
from
my
earliest
youth
experience
convinced
me
of
the
vanity
of
life
and
the
folly
of
men
i
saw
these
latter
ceaselessly
struggling
for
pleasures
that
please
not
and
possessions
that
do
not
satisfy
i
saw
them
inflict
on
themselves
and
voluntarily
suffer
infinite
pains
which
unlike
the
pleasures
were
only
too
genuine
in
short
the
more
ardently
they
sought
happiness
the
further
they
seemed
removed
from
it
these
things
made
me
determine
to
abandon
every
design
to
live
a
life
of
peace
and
obscurity
harming
no
one
striving
in
nought
to
better
my
condition
and
contesting
nothing
with
anyone
i
despaired
of
happiness
which
i
regarded
as
a
thing
withheld
from
our
race
and
my
only
aim
was
to
shield
myself
from
suffering
not
that
i
had
the
least
intention
of
abstaining
from
work
or
bodily
labour
for
there
is
as
great
a
difference
between
mere
fatigue
and
pain
as
between
a
peaceful
and
an
idle
life
but
when
i
began
to
carry
out
my
project
i
learnt
from
experience
how
fallacious
it
is
to
think
that
one
can
live
inoffensively
amongst
men
without
offending
them
though
i
always
gave
them
precedence
and
took
the
smallest
part
of
everything
i
found
neither
rest
nor
happiness
among
them
however
this
i
soon
remedied
by
avoiding
men
i
freed
myself
from
their
persecutions
i
took
refuge
in
solitude
easily
obtainable
in
my
native
island
having
done
this
i
lived
without
a
shadow
of
enjoyment
yet
i
found
i
had
not
escaped
all
suffering
the
intense
cold
of
the
long
winter
and
the
extreme
heat
of
summer
characteristic
of
the
country
allowed
me
no
cessation
from
pain
and
when
to
warm
myself
i
passed
much
time
by
the
fire
i
was
scorched
by
the
flames
and
blinded
by
the
smoke
i
suffered
continuously
whether
in
the
open
air
or
in
the
shelter
of
my
cabin
in
short
i
failed
to
obtain
that
life
of
peace
which
was
my
one
desire
terrible
storms
hecla
menaces
and
rumblings
and
the
constant
fires
which
occur
among
the
wooden
houses
of
my
country
combined
to
keep
me
in
a
state
of
perpetual
disquietude
such
annoyances
as
these
trivial
though
they
be
when
the
mind
is
distracted
by
the
thoughts
and
actions
of
social
and
civil
life
are
intensified
by
solitude
i
endured
them
all
together
with
the
hopeless
monotony
of
my
existence
solely
in
order
to
obtain
the
tranquillity
i
desired
i
perceived
that
the
more
i
isolated
myself
from
men
and
confined
me
to
my
own
little
sphere
the
less
i
succeeded
in
protecting
myself
from
the
discomforts
and
sufferings
of
the
outer
world
then
i
determined
to
try
other
climates
and
countries
to
see
if
anywhere
i
could
live
in
peace
harming
no
one
and
exist
without
suffering
if
also
without
pleasure
i
was
urged
to
this
by
the
thought
that
perhaps
you
had
destined
for
the
human
race
a
certain
part
of
the
earth
as
you
have
for
many
animals
and
plants
where
alone
they
could
live
in
comfort
in
which
case
it
was
our
own
fault
if
we
suffered
inconvenience
from
having
exceeded
our
natural
boundaries
i
have
therefore
been
over
the
whole
earth
testing
every
country
and
always
fulfilling
my
intention
of
troubling
others
in
the
least
possible
degree
and
seeking
nothing
for
myself
but
a
life
of
tranquillity
but
in
vain
the
tropical
sun
burnt
me
the
arctic
cold
froze
me
in
temperate
regions
the
changeability
of
the
weather
troubled
me
and
everywhere
i
have
experienced
the
fury
of
the
elements
i
have
been
in
places
where
not
a
day
passes
without
a
storm
and
where
you
o
nature
are
incessantly
at
war
with
simple
people
who
have
never
done
you
any
harm
in
other
places
cloudless
skies
are
compensated
for
by
frequent
earthquakes
active
volcanoes
and
subterranean
commotions
elsewhere
hurricanes
and
whirlwinds
take
the
place
of
other
scourges
sometimes
i
have
heard
the
roof
over
my
head
groan
with
the
burden
of
snow
that
it
supported
at
other
times
the
earth
saturated
with
rain
has
broken
away
beneath
my
feet
rivers
have
burst
their
banks
and
pursued
me
fleeing
at
full
speed
as
though
i
were
an
enemy
wild
beasts
tried
to
devour
me
without
the
least
provocation
on
my
part
serpents
have
sought
to
poison
or
crush
me
and
i
have
been
nearly
killed
by
insects
i
make
no
mention
of
the
daily
hazards
by
which
man
is
surrounded
these
last
are
so
numerous
that
an
ancient
philosopher
laid
down
a
rule
that
to
resist
the
constant
influence
of
fear
it
were
well
to
fear
everything
again
sickness
has
not
failed
to
torment
me
though
invariably
temperate
and
even
abstemious
in
all
bodily
pleasures
in
truth
our
natural
constitution
is
an
admirably
arranged
affair
you
inspire
us
with
a
strong
and
incessant
yearning
for
pleasure
deprived
of
which
our
life
is
imperfect
and
on
the
other
hand
you
ordain
that
nothing
should
be
more
opposed
to
physical
health
and
strength
more
calamitous
in
its
effects
and
more
incompatible
with
the
duration
of
life
itself
than
this
same
pleasure
but
although
i
indulged
in
no
pleasures
numerous
diseases
attacked
me
some
of
which
endangered
my
life
and
others
the
use
of
my
limbs
thus
threatening
me
with
even
an
access
of
misery
all
during
many
days
or
months
caused
me
to
experience
a
thousand
bodily
and
mental
pangs
and
whereas
in
sickness
we
endure
new
and
extraordinary
sufferings
as
though
our
ordinary
life
were
not
sufficiently
unhappy
you
do
not
compensate
for
this
by
giving
us
equally
exceptional
periods
of
health
and
strength
and
consequent
enjoyment
in
regions
where
the
snow
never
melts
i
lost
my
sight
this
is
an
ordinary
occurrence
among
the
laplanders
in
their
cold
country
the
sun
and
air
things
necessary
for
life
and
therefore
unavoidable
trouble
us
continually
the
latter
by
its
dampness
or
severity
the
former
by
its
heat
and
even
its
light
and
to
neither
of
them
can
man
remain
exposed
without
suffering
more
or
less
inconvenience
or
harm
in
short
i
can
not
recollect
a
single
day
during
which
i
have
not
suffered
in
some
way
whereas
on
the
other
hand
the
days
that
have
gone
by
without
a
shadow
of
enjoyment
are
countless
i
conclude
therefore
that
we
are
destined
to
suffer
much
in
proportion
as
we
enjoy
little
and
that
it
is
as
impossible
to
live
peacefully
as
happily
i
also
naturally
come
to
the
conclusion
that
you
are
the
avowed
enemy
of
men
and
all
other
creatures
of
your
creation
sometimes
alluring
at
other
times
menacing
now
attacking
now
striking
now
pursuing
now
destroying
you
are
always
engaged
in
tormenting
us
either
by
habit
or
necessity
you
are
the
enemy
of
your
own
family
and
the
executioner
of
your
own
flesh
and
blood
as
for
me
i
have
lost
all
hope
experience
has
proved
to
me
that
though
it
be
possible
to
escape
from
men
and
their
persecutions
it
is
impossible
to
evade
you
who
will
never
cease
tormenting
us
until
you
have
trodden
us
under
foot
old
age
with
all
its
bitterness
and
sorrows
and
accumulation
of
troubles
is
already
near
to
me
this
worst
of
evils
you
have
destined
for
us
and
all
created
beings
from
the
time
of
infancy
from
the
fifth
lustre
of
life
decline
makes
itself
manifest
its
progress
we
are
powerless
to
stay
scarce
a
third
of
life
is
spent
in
the
bloom
of
youth
but
few
moments
are
claimed
by
maturity
all
the
rest
is
one
gradual
decay
with
its
attendant
evils
thinkest
thou
then
that
the
world
was
made
for
thee
it
is
time
thou
knewest
that
in
my
designs
operations
and
decrees
i
never
gave
a
thought
to
the
happiness
or
unhappiness
of
man
if
i
cause
you
to
suffer
i
am
unaware
of
the
fact
nor
do
i
perceive
that
i
can
in
any
way
give
you
pleasure
what
i
do
is
in
no
sense
done
for
your
enjoyment
or
benefit
as
you
seem
to
think
finally
if
i
by
chance
exterminated
your
species
i
should
not
know
it
suppose
a
stranger
invited
me
to
his
house
in
a
most
pressing
manner
and
i
to
oblige
him
accepted
his
invitation
on
my
arrival
he
took
me
to
a
damp
and
unhealthy
place
and
lodged
me
in
a
chamber
open
to
the
air
and
so
ruinous
that
it
threatened
momentarily
to
collapse
and
crush
me
far
from
endeavouring
to
amuse
me
and
make
me
comfortable
he
neglected
to
provide
me
with
even
the
necessaries
of
life
and
more
than
this
suppose
my
host
caused
me
to
be
insulted
ridiculed
threatened
and
beaten
by
his
sons
and
household
and
on
my
complaining
to
him
of
such
he
replied
dost
thou
think
i
made
this
house
for
thee
do
i
keep
these
my
children
and
servants
for
thy
service
i
assure
thee
i
have
other
things
to
occupy
me
than
that
i
should
amuse
thee
or
give
thee
welcome
to
which
i
answered
well
my
friend
though
you
may
not
have
built
your
house
especially
for
me
at
least
you
might
have
forborne
to
ask
me
hither
and
since
i
owe
it
to
you
that
i
am
here
ought
i
not
to
rely
on
you
to
assure
me
if
possible
a
life
free
from
trouble
and
danger
thus
i
reply
to
you
i
am
well
aware
you
did
not
make
the
world
for
the
service
of
men
it
were
easier
to
believe
that
you
made
it
expressly
as
a
place
of
torment
for
them
but
tell
me
why
am
i
here
at
all
did
i
ask
to
come
into
the
world
or
am
i
here
unnaturally
contrary
to
your
will
if
however
you
yourself
have
placed
me
here
without
giving

of

you
not

and

a

one
and
what
i
say
of
myself
i
say
of

human
race
and
of
every
living
creature
thou
forgettest
that
the
life
of
the
world
is
a
perpetual
cycle
of
production
and
destruction
so
combined
that
the
one
works
for
the
good
of
the
other
by
their
joint
operation
the
universe
is
preserved
if
either
ceased
the
world
would
dissolve
therefore
if
suffering
were
removed
from
the
earth
its
own
existence
would
be
endangered
so
say
all
the
philosophers
but
since
that
which
is
destroyed
suffers
and
that
which
is
born
from
its
destruction
also
suffers
in
due
course
and
finally
is
in
its
turn
destroyed
would
you
enlighten
me
on
one
point
about
which
hitherto
no
philosopher
has
satisfied
me
for
whose
pleasure
and
service
is
this
wretched
life
of
the
world
maintained
by
the
suffering
and
death
of
all
the
beings
which
compose
it
whilst
they
discussed
these
and
similar
questions

enfeebled

accomplished
the
feat
however
and
thus
gained
sufficient

to

dispute
this

the
unfortunate
icelander
was
blown
to
the
ground
and
soon
overwhelmed
beneath

of

here
his
corpse
was

preserved
and
in

he
was
transformed
into
a

mummy

discovered
the

one
of

to

joined

such
glory
as
is
sometimes
the
reward
of
wisdom
and
literary
and
other
studies
now
you
are
not
unaware
that
this
glory
though
far
from
being
despised
was
by
our
greatest
ancestors
held
in
less
esteem
than
that
derivable
from
other
things
cicero
for
instance
though
a
most
ardent
and
successful
follower
of
glory
frequently
and
emphatically
makes
apology
for
the
time
and
labour
he
had
spent
in
its
pursuit
on
one
occasion
he
states
that
his
literary
and
philosophical
studies
were
secondary
to
his
public
life
on
another
that
being
constrained
by
the
wickedness
of
the
age
to
abandon
more
important
business
he
hoped
to
spend
his
leisure
profitably
amid
these
studies
he
invariably
rated
the
glory
of
his
writings
at
a
lower
value
than
that
acquired
from
his
consulship
and
his
labours
on
behalf
of
the
republic
indeed
if
human
life
be
the
principal
subject
of
literature
and
to
rule
our
actions
the
first
lesson
of
philosophy
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
action
itself
is
as
much
more
important
and
noble
than
thoughts
and
writing
as
the
end
is
nobler
than
the
means
or
as

with

and
reasoning
for
no
man
however
clever
he
be
is
naturally
created
for
study
nor
born
to

action
alone

natural
to
him

of
fine
writers
and
especially
illustrious
poets
in
the
present
age

to

then
if
by
chance
the
deeds
of
these
men
prove
unacceptable
either
from
the
nature
of
the
times
or
their
own
they
take
up
the
pen
and
write
grand
things
nor
can
people
write
who
have
neither
the
disposition
nor
power
to

from
this
you
will
easily
understand
why
so
few
italians
gain
immortal
fame
by
their
writings
it
is
that
they
are
by
nature
unfit
for
noble
actions
antiquity
especially
that
of
the
early
greeks
or
romans
is
i
think
comparable
to
the
design
of
the
statue
of
telesilla
who
was
a
poetess
a
warrior
and
the
saviour
of
her
country
she
is
represented
holding
her
helmet
at
which
she
looks
intently
and
longingly
as
though
she
desired
to
place
it
on
her
head
at
her
feet
lie
some
books
almost
disregarded
as
forming
but
an
insignificant
part
of
her
glory
but
men
of
modern
times
are
differently
situated
to
the
ancients
glory
is
less
open
to
them
they
who
make
studies
their
vocation
in

show
the
greatest
possible
magnanimity
nor
need
they
like
cicero
apologise
to
their
country
for
the
profession
they
have
chosen
i
therefore
applaud
the
nobility
of
your
decision
but
since
a
life
of
letters
being
unnatural
can
not
be
lived
without
injury
to
the
body
nor
without
increasing
in
many
ways
the
natural
infelicity
of
your
mind
i
regard
it
as
my
duty
to
explain
to
you
the
various
difficulties
attendant
on
the
pursuit
of
that
glory
towards
which
you
aspire
and
the
results
that
will
follow
success
should
you
attain
it
you
will
then
be
able
to
estimate
on
the
one
hand
the
importance
and
value
of
the
goal
and
your
chance
of
reaching
it
and
on
the
other
the
sufferings
exertions
and
discomforts
inseparable
from
the
pursuit
thus
you
may
be
better
able
to
decide
whether
it
be
expedient
to
continue
as
you
have
begun

to
seek
glory

expose
to
you
the
difficulties
and
troubles
which
apart
from
the
malice
of
men
will
stubbornly
contest
the
prize
of
glory
these
embarrassments
are
of
ordinary
not
exceptional
occurrence
and
have
been
experienced
by
most
great
writers
you
are
aware
that
no
one
can
be
called
a
great
writer
nor
obtains
true
and
lasting
glory
except
by
means
of
excellent
and
perfect
works
or
such
as
approach
perfection
the
following
very
true
utterance
of
castiglione
is
worthy
of
being
engraved
on
your
mind
it
is
very
seldom
that
a
person
unaccustomed
to
write
however
learned
he
be
can
adequately
recognise
the
skill
and
industry
of
writers
or
appreciate
the
delicacy
and
excellence
of
styles
and
those
subtle
and
hidden
significations
which
abound
in
the
writings
of
the
ancients
in
the
first
place
consider
how
very
few
people
practise
or
learn
the
art
of
composition
and
think
from
how
small
a
number
of
men
whether
in
the
present
or
the
future
you
can
in
any
case
look
for
the
magnificent
estimation
which
you
hope
will
be
the
reward
of
your
life
consider
too
how
much
influence
style
has
in
securing
appreciation
for
writings
on
this
and
their
degree
of
perfection
depends
the
subsequent
fate
of
all
works
that
come
under
the
heading
of
literature
so
great
is
the
influence
of
style
that
a
book
presumably
celebrated
for
its
matter
often
proves
valueless
when
deprived
of
its
manner
now
language
is
so
interwoven
with
style
that
the
one
can
hardly
be
considered
apart
from
the
other
men
frequently
confuse
the
two
together
and
are
often
unable
to
express
the
distinction
between
them
if
even
they
are
aware
of
it
in
the
first
place
and
as
for
the
thousand
merits
and
defects
of
language
and
style
with
difficulty
if
at
all
can
they
be
discerned
and
assigned
to
their
respective
properties
but
it
is
certain
to
quote
the
words
of
castiglione
that
no
foreigner
is
to
write
with
elegance
in
your
language
it
follows
therefore
that
style
which
is
so
great
and
important
a
necessity
in
composition
and
a
thing
of
such
unaccountable
difficulty
and
labour
both
in
acquirement
and
usage
can
only
properly
be
judged
and
appreciated
by
the
persons
who
in
one
single
nation
are
accustomed
to
write
for
all
other
people
the
boundless
exertions
attached
to
the
formation
of
style
will
be
almost
useless
and
as
if
entirely
wasted
i
will
not
refer
to
the
infinite
diversities
of
opinion
and
the
various
tendencies
of
readers
owing
to
which
the
number
of
persons
adapted
to
perceive
the
good
qualities
of
this
or
that
book
is
still
more
reduced
you
must
regard
it
as
an
undoubted
fact
that
in
order
to
distinctly
recognise
the
value
of
a
perfect
or
nearly
perfect
work
deserving
of
immortality
it
is
not
enough
merely
to
be
accustomed
to
write
you
yourself
must
be
able
to
accomplish
the
work
in
question
almost
as
perfectly
as
the
writer
himself
and
as
experience
gradually
teaches
you
what
qualities
constitute
a
perfect
writer
and
what
an
infinity
of
difficulties
must
be
surmounted
before
these
can
be
obtained
you
will
learn
how
to
overcome
the
latter
and
acquire
the
former
so
that
in
time
knowledge
and
power
will
prove
to
be
one
and
the
same
thing
hence
a
man
can
not
discern
nor
fully
appreciate
the
excellence
of
perfect
writers
until
he
is
able
to
give
expression
to
it
in
his
own
writings
because
such
perfection
can
only
be
appreciated
by
what
may
be
termed
a
transference
of
it
into
oneself
until
this
be
done
a
man
can
not
really
understand
what
constitutes
perfection
in
writing
and
will
therefore
be
unable
to
duly
admire
the
best
writers
now
most
literary
men
because
they
write
easily
think
they
write
well
they
therefore
regard
good
writing
as
a
facile
accomplishment
even
though
they
assert
the
contrary
think
then
how
the
number
will
be
reduced
of
those
who
might
appreciate
and
laud
you
when
after
inconceivable
exertions
and
care
you
succeed
in
producing
a
noble
and
perfect
work
in
the
present
day
there
are
scarcely
two
or
three
men
in
italy
who
have
acquired
the
art
of
perfect
writing
and
although
this
number
may
appear
to
you
excessively
small
at
no
time
nor
place
has
it
ever
been
much
greater
i
often
wonder
to
myself
how
virgil
as
a
supreme
example
of
literary
perfection
ever
acquired
the
high
reputation
in
which
he
is
now
held
for
i
am
certain
that
most
of
his
readers
and
eulogisers
do
not
discover
in
his
poems
more
than
one
beauty
for
every
ten
or
twenty
revealed
to
me
by
continuous
study
and
meditation
not
that
i
imagine
i
have
succeeded
in
estimating
him
at
his
proper
value
nor
have
derived
every
possible
enjoyment
from
his
writings
in
truth
the
esteem
and
admiration
professed
for
the
greatest
writers
is
ordinarily
the
result
of
a
blind
predisposition
in
their
favour
rather
than
the
outcome
of
an
impartial
judgment
or
the
consequence
of
a
due
appreciation
of
their
merits
when
i
was
young
i
remember
first
reading
virgil
being
on
the
one
hand
unbiassed
in
my
judgment
and
careless
of
the
opinion
of
others
a
very
rare
thing
by
the
by
and
on
the
other
hand
as
ignorant
as
most
boys
of
my
age
though
perhaps
not
more
so
than
is
the
unchanging
condition
of
many
readers
i
refused
to
admit
that
virgil
reputation
was
merited
since
i
failed
to
discover
in
him
much
more
than
is
to
be
found
in
very
ordinary
poets
indeed
it
surprises
me
that
fame
should
excel
that
of
lucan
for
we
see
the
mass
of
readers
at
all
times
equally
when
the
literature
of
the
day
is
of
a
debasing
or
an
elevating
tendency
much
prefer
gross
and
unmistakable
beauties
to
those
that
are
delicate
and
they
also
prefer
fervour
to
modesty
often
indeed
even
the
apparent
to
the
real
and
usually
mediocrity
to
perfection
in
reading
the
letters
of
a
certain
prince
exceptionally
intelligent
whose
writing
was
remarkable
for
its
wit
pleasantry
smoothness
and
acuteness
i
clearly
discerned
that
in
his
heart
he
preferred
the
henriad
to
the
æneid
although
the
fear
of
shocking
men
sensibilities
might
deter
him
from
confessing
such
a
preference
i
am
astonished
that
the
judgment
of
a
few
correct
though
it
be
should
have
succeeded
in
controlling
that
of
numbers
and
should
have
established
the
custom
of
an
esteem
no
less
blind
than
just
this
however
does
not
always
occur
and
i
imagine
that
the
fame
gained
by
the
best
writers
is
rather
a
matter
of
chance
than
merit
my
opinion
may
be
confirmed
by
what
i
say
as
we
proceed
chapter
iii
we
have
seen
how
very
few
people
will
be
able
to
appreciate
you
when
you
succeed
in
becoming
a
perfect
writer
now
i
wish
to
indicate
some
of
the
hindrances
that
will
prevent
even
these
few
from
rightly
estimating
your
worth
although
they
see
the
signs
of
it
in
the
first
place
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
all
writings
of
eloquence
or
poetry
are
judged
not
so
much
on
their
merits
as
by
the
effect
they
produce
in
the
mind
of
the
reader
so
that
the
reader
may
be
said
to
consider
them
rather
in
himself
than
in
themselves
consequently
men
who
are
naturally
devoid
of
imagination
and
enthusiasm
though
gifted
with
much
intelligence
discernment
and
no
little
learning
are
almost
quite
incapable
of
forming
a
correct
judgment
of
fanciful
writings
they
can
not
in
the
least
immerse
their
minds
in
the
mind
of
the
writer
and
usually
have
within
themselves
a
feeling
of
contempt
for
his
compositions
because
unable
to
discover
in
what
their
so
great
fame
consists
such
reading
awakens
no
emotion
within
them
nor
does
it
arouse
their
imagination
or
create
in
them
any
especial
sensation
of
pleasure
and
even
people
who
are
naturally
disposed
and
inclined
to
receive
the
impression
of
whatever
image
or
fancy
a
writer
has
properly
signified
very
often
experience
a
feeling
of
coldness
indifference
languor
or
dulness
so
that
for
the
time
they
resemble
the
persons
just
mentioned
this
change
is
due
to
divers
causes
internal
and
external
physical
and
mental
and
is
either
temporary
or
lasting
at
such
times
no
one
even
though
himself
an
excellent
writer
is
a
good
judge
of
writings
intended
to
excite
the
affections
or
the
imagination
again
there
is
the
danger
of
satiety
due
to
previous
reading
of
similar
writings
certain
passions
too
of
more
or
less
strength
from
time
to
time
invest
the
mind
leaving
no
room
for
the
emotions
which
ought
to
be
excited
by
the
reading
and
it
often
happens
that
places
spectacles
natural
or
artificial
music
and
a
hundred
such
things
which
would
ordinarily
excite
us
are
now
incapable
of
arousing
or
delighting
us
in
the
least
although
no
less
attractive
than
formerly
but
though
a
man
for
one
or
other
of
these
reasons
may
be
ill
disposed
to
appreciate
the
effects
of
eloquence
or
poetry
he
does
not
for
that
reason
defer
judgment
of
books
on
both
these
subjects
which
he
then
happens
to
read
for
the
first
time
i
myself
sometimes
take
up
homer
cicero
or
petrarch
and
read
without
feeling
the
least
emotion
yet
as
i
am
quite
aware
of
the
merits
of
these
writers
both
because
of
their
reputation
and
my
own
frequent
appreciation
of
their
charms
i
do
not
for
a
moment
think
them
undeservedly
praised
simply
because
i
am
at
present
too
dull
to
do
them
justice
but
it
is
different
with
books
read
for
the
first
time
which
are
too
new
to
have
acquired
a
reputation
there
is
nothing
in
such
cases
to
prevent
the
reader
forming
a
low
opinion
of
the
author
and
the
merits
of
his
book
if
his
mind
be
indisposed
to
do
justice
to
the
sentiments
and
imagery
contained
in
the
work
nor
would
it
be
easy
to
induce
him
to
alter
his
judgment
by
subsequent
study
of
the
same
book
under
better
auspices
for
probably
the
disgust
inspired
by
his
first
reading
will
deter
him
from
a
second
and
in
any
case
the
strength
of
first
impressions
will
be
almost
invincible
on
the
other
hand
the
mind
is
sometimes
for
one
reason
or
another
in
such
a
state
of
sensibility
vivacity
vigour
and
fervour
that
it
follows
even
the
least
suggestion
of
the
reading
it
feels
keenly
the
slightest
touch
and
as
it
reads
is
able
to
create
within
itself
a
thousand
emotions
and
fancies
sometimes
losing
itself
in
a
sort
of
sweet
delirium
when
it
is
almost
transported
out
of
itself
as
a
natural
result
of
this
the
mind
reviewing
the
pleasures
enjoyed
in
the
reading
and
not
distinguishing
between
its
own
predisposition
and
the
actual
merits
of
the
book
experiences
a
feeling
of
so
great
admiration
and
forms
so
high
a
conception
of
it
as
even
to
rank
the
book
above
others
of
much
greater
merit
read
under
less
felicitous
circumstances
see
therefore
to
what
uncertainty
is
subject
even
the
truth
and
justice
of
opinions
from
the
same
persons
as
to
the
writings
and
genius
of
others
quite
apart
from
any
sentiment
of
malice
or
favour
so
great
is
this
uncertainty
that
a
man
varies
considerably
in
his
estimation
of
works
of
equal
value
and
even
the
same
work
at
different
times
of
life
under
different
circumstances
and
even
at
different
hours
of
the
day
chapter
iv
perhaps
you
may
think
that
these
difficulties
due
to
mental
indisposition
on
the
part
of
readers
are
of
rare
occurrence
consider
then
how
frequently
a
man
as
he
grows
old
becomes
incapable
of
appreciating
the
charms
of
eloquence
and
poetry
no
less
than
those
of
the
other
imitative
arts
and
everything
beautiful
in
the
world
this
intellectual
decay
is
a
necessity
of
our
nature
in
the
present
day
it
is
so
much
greater
than
formerly
begins
so
much
earlier
and
progresses
so
much
more
rapidly
especially
in
the
studious
as
our
experience
is
enlarged
in
more
or
less
degree
by
the
knowledge
begotten
of
the
speculations
of
so
many
past
centuries
for
which
reason
and
owing
to
the
present
condition
of
civilised
life
the
phantoms
of
childhood
soon
vanish
from
the
imagination
of
men
with
them
go
the
hopes
of
the
mind
and
with
the
hopes
most
of
the
desires
passions
and
energy
of
life
and
its
faculties
whence
i
often
wonder
that
men
of
mature
age
especially
the
learned
and
those
inclined
to
meditate
about
human
affairs
should
yet
be
subject
to
the
influence
of
poetry
and
eloquence
which
are
however
unable
to
produce
any
real
effect
on
them
it
may
be
regarded
as
a
fact
that
in
order
to
be
greatly
moved
by
imagination
of
the
grand
and
beautiful
one
must
believe
that
there
is
something
really
grand
and
beautiful
in
human
life
and
that
poetry
is
not
mere
fable
the
young
always
believe
such
things
even
when
they
know
their
fallacy
until
personal
experience
forces
them
to
accept
the
truth
but
it
is
difficult
to
put
faith
in
them
after
the
sad
discipline
of
practical
life
especially
when
experience
is
combined
with
habits
of
study
and
speculation
from
this
it
would
seem
that
the
young
are
generally
better
judges
of
writings
intended
to
arouse
the
affections
and
the
imagination
than
men
of
mature
and
advanced
age
but
on
the
other
hand
the
young
are
novices
in
literature
they
exact
from
books
a
superhuman
boundless
and
impossible
pleasure
and
where
they
fail
to
experience
this
they
despise
the
writer
illiterate
people
have
the
same
idea
of
the
functions
of
literature
and
youths
addicted
to
reading
prefer
both
in
their
own
writings
and
those
of
others
extravagance
to
moderation
magnificence
or
attractiveness
of
style
and
ornamentation
to
the
simple
and
natural
and
sham
beauties
to
real
ones
this
is
partly
due
to
their
limited
experience
and
partly
to
the
impetuosity
of
their
time
of
life
consequently
although
the
young
are
doubtless
more
inclined
than
their
elders
to
applaud
what
seems
good
to
them
since
they
are
more
truthful
and
candid
they
are
seldom
capable
of
appreciating
the
excellences
of
literary
works
as
we
grow
older
the
influence
exercised
over
us
by
art
increases
as
that
of
nature
diminishes
nevertheless
both
nature
and
art
are
necessary
to
produce
effect
dwellers
in
large
towns
are
compelled
to
sacrifice
the
beautiful
to
the
useful
even
though
of
warm
and
sensitive
natures
and
lively
imagination
they
can
not
experience
as
an
effect
of
the
charms
either
of
nature
or
literature
any
tender
or
noble
sentiment
any
sublime
or
delightful
fancy
unless
indeed
like
you
they
spend
most
of
their
time
in
solitude
eor
few
things
are
so
opposed
to
the
state
of
mind
necessary
to
appreciate
such
delights
as
the
conversation
of
these
men
the
riot
of
these
places
and
the
sight
of
the
tinselled
splendour
the
falseness
the
miserable
troubles
and
still
more
miserable
idleness
which
abound
there
i
also
think
that
the
of
large
towns
are
as
a
rule
less
qualified
to
judge
books
than
those
of
small
towns
because
like
everything
else
the
literature
of
large
towns
is
ordinarily
false
and
pretentious
or
superficial
and
whereas
the
ancients
used
to
regard
literature
and
the
sciences
as
a
pleasing
change
from
more
serious
business
in
the
present
day
the
majority
of
men
who
in
large
towns
profess
to
be
students
regard
literature
and
writing
as
merely
an
agreeable
variation
of
their
other
amusements
i
think
that
works
of
art
whether
painting
sculpture
or
architecture
would
be
much
more
appreciated
if
they
were
disseminated
throughout
a
country
in
towns
instead
of
being
as
at
present
accumulated
in
the
chief
cities
for
in
the
latter
places
men
are
so
full
of
thoughts
so
occupied
with
pleasurable
pursuits
and
vain
and
frivolous
excitements
that
they
are
very
rarely
capable
of
the
profound
pleasures
of
the
intellect
besides
a
multitude
of
fine
things
gathered
together
have
a
distracting
influence
the
mind
bestows
but
little
attention
on
individual
things
and
is
sensible
of
no
especial
gratification
or
else
it
becomes
satiated
and
regards
them
all
as
indifferently
as
though
they
were
objects
of
the
commonest
kind
i
say
the
same
of
music
which
is
nowhere
so
elaborate
or
brought
to
such
perfection
as
in
large
towns
where
men
have
less
appreciation
for
the
wonderful
emotions
of
the
art
and
are
indeed
less
musical
than
elsewhere
nevertheless
large
towns
are
a
useful
home
for
the
fostering
and
perfecting
of
the
arts
although
their
inhabitants
are
less
under
the
influence
of
their
charms
than
the
people
of
other
places
it
may
be
said
that
artists
who
work
in
solitude
and
silence
strive
laboriously
and
industriously
to
please
men
who
because
accustomed
to
the
bustle
and
noise
of
cities
are
almost
totally
incapable
of
appreciating
the
fruit
of
their
exertions
the
fate
of
writers
may
in
a
measure
be
compared
to
that
of
artists
chapter
we
will
now
return
to
the
consideration
of
authors
it
is
a
characteristic
of
writings
approaching
perfection
that
they
usually
please
more
when
read
a
second
time
than
they
pleased
at
first
the
contrary
effect
is
produced
by
many
books
written
carefully
and
skilfully
but
which
really
possess
few
merits
these
when
read
a
second
time
are
less
esteemed
than
at
first
but
both
kinds
of
books
when
read
only
once
often
deceive
even
the
learned
and
experienced
so
that
indifferent
books
are
preferred
to
excellent
ones
in
the
present
day
however
even
students
by
profession
can
rarely
be
induced
to
read
new
books
a
second
time
especially
such
as
come
under
the
heading
of
light
literature
this
was
not
so
in
olden
times
because
then
but
few
books
were
in
existence
now
it
is
very
different
we
possess
the
literary
bequests
of
all
past
times
every
nation
has
its
literature
and
produces
its
host
of
books
daily
there
are
writings
in
all
languages
ancient
and
modern
relating
to
every
branch
of
science
and
learning
and
so
closely
connected
and
allied
that
the
student
must
study
them
all
as
far
as
possible
you
may
therefore
easily
imagine
that
a
book
does
not
obtain
full
consideration
on
a
first
reading
and
that
a
second
reading
is
out
of
the
question
yet
the
first
opinion
that
we
form
of
a
new
book
is
seldom
changed
for
the
same
reasons
even
in
the
first
reading
of
books
especially
those
of
light
literature
very
rarely
sufficient
attention
and
study
is
given
to
discover
the
laborious
perfection
the
subtle
art
and
the
hidden
and
unpretentious
virtues
of
the
writings
thus
in
the
present
day
the
condition
of
excellent
books
is
really
worse
than
that
of
indifferent
ones
for
the
charms
and
qualifications
of
most
of
the
latter
whether
true
or
false
are
so
exposed
to
the
eye
that
however
trivial
they
may
be
they
are
easily
discernible
at
first
sight
we
may
therefore
say
with
truth
that
the
exertion
necessary
to
produce
perfect
writing
is
almost
useless
for
fame
but
on
the
other
hand
books
composed
like
most
modern
ones
rapidly
and
without
any
great
degree
of
excellence
though
perhaps
celebrated
for
a
time
can
not
fail
to
be
soon
forgotten
and
many
works
of
recognised
value
are
also
lost
in
the
immense
stream
of
new
books
which
pours
forth
daily
before
they
have
had
time
to
establish
their
celebrity
they
perish
for
no
intrinsic
fault
of
their
own
and
give
place
to
other
books
good
and
bad
which
each
in
turn
live
their
short
spell
of
life
so
that
whereas
the
ancients
could
acquire
glory
in
a
thousand
ways
we
can
only
attain
it
by
one
single
avenue
after
much
more
exertion
than
formerly
the
books
of
the
ancients
alone
survive
this
universal
shipwreck
of
all
later
writings
their
fame
is
established
and
confirmed
they
are
diligently
and
repeatedly
read
and
are
made
the
subject
of
careful
study
and
it
is
noteworthy
that
a
modern
book
if
intrinsically
equal
to
any
of
the
ancient
writings
would
rarely
if
ever
give
its
readers
as
much
pleasure
as
the
ancient
work
this
for
two
reasons
in
the
first
place
it
would
not
be
read
with
the
care
and
attention
that
we
bestow
on
celebrated
writings
very
few
people
would
read
it
twice
and
no
one
would
study
it
for
none
but
scientific
books
are
studied
until
made
venerable
by
age
in
the
second
place
the
and
permanent
reputation
of
writings
whether
or
not
due
to
their
internal
excellence
adds
to
their
value
and
proportionately
increases
the
pleasure
they
give
often
indeed
most
of
the
charm
of
such
literature
is
simply
due
to
its
celebrity
this
reminds
me
of
some
remarkable
words
of
montesquieu
about
the
origin
of
human
pleasures
he
says
mind
often
creates
within
itself
many
sources
of
pleasure
which
are
intimately
dependent
on
each
other
thus
a
thing
that
has
once
pleased
us
pleases
us
again
simply
because
it
did
so
before
we
couple
together
imagination
of
the
present
and
remembrance
of
the
past
for
example
an
actress
who
pleased
us
on
the
stage
will
probably
please
us
in
private
life
her
voice
her
manner
the
recollection
of
the
applause
she
excited
perhaps
too
her
of
princess
joined
to
her
real
character
all
combine
and
form
a
mixture
of
influences
producing
a
general
feeling
of
pleasure
our
minds
are
always
full
of
ideas
subordinate
to
one
or
more
primary
ideas
a
woman
famous
for
one
cause
or
another
and
possessed
of
some
slight
inherent
defect
is
often
able
to
attract
by
means
of
this
very
defect
and
women
are
ordinarily
loved
less
because
they
inspire
affection
than
because
they
are
well
born
rich
or
highly
esteemed
by
often
indeed
a
woman
reputation
for
beauty
and
grace
whether
well
or
ill
founded
or
even
the
mere
fact
that
others
have
been
under
the
influence
of
her
charms
suffices
to
inspire
a
man
with
affection
for
her
and
who
does
not
know
that
most
pleasures
are
due
to
the
imagination
rather
than
to
the
inherent
qualities
of
the
things
that
please
us
these
remarks
refer
to
writings
no
less
than
to
all
other
things
indeed
i
will
venture
to
say
that
were
a
poem
to
be
published
equal
or
superior
to
the
iliad
and
carefully
read
by
an
excellent
judge
of
poetry
it
would
give
less
satisfaction
and
appear
less
charming
than
the
greek
masterpiece
much
less
would
its
fame
be
comparable
with
that
of
the
iliad
for
its
real
merits
would
not
be
aided
by
centuries
of
admiration
nor
the
thousand
reminiscences
and
other
associations
that
connect
themselves
with
homer
poem
similarly
i
affirm
that
if
any
one
were
to
read
carefully
either
the
or
the
without
knowing
anything
of
their
celebrity
he
would
be
much
less
pleased
than
others
who
were
aware
of
their
fame
in
short
it
may
be
accepted
as
a
general
rule
that
the
first
readers
of
every
remarkable
work
which
in
after
ages
becomes
famous
and
the
contemporaries
of
the
writer
derive
less
enjoyment
from
such
reading
than
all
other
people
this
fact
can
not
but
be
very
disadvantageous
to
the
interest
of
writers
footnote

such
are
a
few
of
the
obstacles
that
may
prevent
you
from
acquiring
glory
from
the
studious
or
even
from
those
who
excel
in
knowledge
and
the
art
of
writing
now
there
are
many
people
who
though
educated
sufficiently
for
the
purposes
of
daily
life
are
neither
writers
nor
students
to
any
very
great
extent
they
read
simply
for
amusement
and
as
you
know
are
only
capable
of
appreciating
certain
qualities
in
literature
the
chief
reason
of
this
has
been
already
partly
explained
there
is
however
another
cause
it
is
that
they
only
seek
momentary
pleasure
in
what
they
read
but
the
present
in
itself
is
trivial
and
joyless
to
all
men
even
the
sweetest
things
as
says
homer
sleep
song
and
the
dance
soon
weary
us
if
to
the
present
there
be
not
joined
the
hope
of
some
pleasure
or
future
satisfaction
dependent
on
them
for
it
is
contrary
to
human
nature
to
be
greatly
pleased
with
that
of
which
hope
does
not
form
a
constituent
part
and
so
great
is
the
power
of
hope
that
it
enlivens
and
sweetens
many
exertions
painful
and
laborious
in
themselves
whereas
on
the
other
hand
things
innately
charming
when
unaccompanied
by
hope
are
scarce
sufficiently
attractive
to
be
welcomed
we
see
studious
people
never
tired
of
reading
often
even
of
the
driest
kind
and
they
experience
a
constant
delight
in
their
studies
carried
on
perhaps
throughout
the
greater
part
of
the
day
the
reason
of
this
is
that
they
have
the
future
ever
before
their
eyes
they
hope
in
some
way
and
at
some
time
to
reap
the
benefit
of
their
labours
such
people
always
have
their
interests
at
heart
they
do
not
take
up
a
book
either
to
pass
time
or
for
amusement
without
also
distilling
from
it
more
or
less
definite
instruction
others
on
the
contrary
who
seek
to
learn
nothing
from
books
are
satisfied
when
they
have
read
their
first
few
pages
or
those
that
have
the
most
attractive
appearance
they
wander
wearily
from
book
to
book
and
marvel
to
themselves
how
any
one
can
find
prolonged
pleasure
in
prolonged
reading
it
is
clear
that
any
skill
or
industry
displayed
by
the
writer
is
almost
entirely
wasted
on
such
people
who
nevertheless
compose
the
mass
of
readers
and
even
men
of
studious
inclinations
having
later
in
life
changed
the
nature
of
their
studies
almost
feel
a
repugnance
for
books
which
would
formerly
have
given
them
intense
delight
and
though
still
able
to
discern
their
value
are
wearied
rather
than
pleased
by
their
merits
because
instruction
is
not
at
all
what
they
desire
chapter
vii
hitherto
we
have
considered
writings
in
general
and
certain
things
relating
to
light
literature
in
particular
towards
which
i
see
you
are
more
especially
attracted
let
us
now
turn
to
philosophy
though
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
this
science
is
separable
from
the
study
of
letters
perhaps
you
will
think
that
because
philosophy
is
derived
from
reason
which
among
civilised
people
is
usually
a
stronger
power
than
the
imagination
or
the
affections
the
value
of
philosophical
works
ought
to
be
more
universally
recognised
than
that
of
poems
and
other
writings
which
treat
of
the
pleasurable
and
the
beautiful
it
is
however
my
opinion
that
poetry
is
better
understood
and
appreciated
than
philosophy
in
the
first
place
it
is
certain
that
a
subtle
intelligence
and
great
power
of
reasoning
are
not
sufficient
to
ensure
much
progress
in
philosophy
considerable
imaginative
power
is
also
requisite
indeed
judged
from
the
nature
of
their
intellects
descartes
galileo
leibnitz
newton
and
vico
would
have
made
excellent
poets
and
on
the
other
hand
homer
dante
and
shakespeare
might
have
been
great
philosophers
this
subject
would
require
much
elaboration
i
will
therefore
merely
affirm
that
none
but
philosophers
can
perfectly
appreciate
the
value
and
realise
the
charm
of
philosophical
books
of
course
i
refer
to
their
substance
and
not
to
whatever
superficial
merit
they
may
have
whether
of
language
style
or
anything
else
and
just
as
men
are
by
nature
unpoetical
and
consequently
rarely
catch
the
spirit
of
a
poem
or
discern
its
imagery
although
they
may
follow
the
meaning
of
its
words
similarly
people
unaccustomed
to
meditate
and
philosophise
within
themselves
or
who
are
incapable
of
deep
sustained
thought
can
not
comprehend
the
truths
that
a
philosopher
expounds
however
clear
and
logical
his
deductions
arguments
and
conclusions
may
be
although
they
understand
the
words
that
he
uses
and
their
signification
because
being
unable
or
unused
to
analyse
the
essence
of
things
by
means
of
thought
or
to
separate
their
own
ideas
into
divisions
or
to
join
and
bind
together
a
number
of
these
ideas
or
simultaneously
to
grasp
with
the
mind
many
particulars
so
as
to
deduce
a
single
general
rule
from
them
or
to
follow
unweariedly
with
the
mind
eye
a
long
series
of
truths
mutually
connected
or
to
discover
the
subtle
and
hidden
connection
between
each
truth
and
a
hundred
others
they
can
with
difficulty
if
at
all
grasp
and
follow
his
working
or
experience
the
impressions
proved
by
the
philosopher
therefore
they
can
neither
understand
nor
estimate
rightly
all
the
influences
that
led
him
to
this
or
that
opinion
and
made
him
affirm
or
deny
this
or
that
thing
and
doubt
such
and
such
another
possibly
they
may
understand
his
ideas
but
they
neither
recognise
their
truth
nor
probability
because
they
are
unable
to
test
either
the
one
or
the
other
they
are
like
those
cold
and
passionless
men
who
are
incapable
of
appreciating
the
fancies
and
imagery
of
the
poets
and
you
know
it
is
common
to
the
poet
and
the
philosopher
to
penetrate
into
the
depths
of
the
minds
of
men
and
thence
to
bring
into
light
all
their
hidden
emotions
profundities
and
secret
working
with
their
respective
causes
and
effects
thus
men
who
are
incapable
of
sympathy
with
the
poet
and
his
thoughts
are
also
incapable
of
entering
into
the
thoughts
of
the
philosopher
this
is
why
we
see
daily
many
meritorious
works
clear
and
intelligible
to
all
interpreted
by
some
people
as
containing
a
thousand
undoubted
truths
and
by
others
a
thousand
patent
errors
they
are
attacked
in
public
and
private
not
only
from
motives
of
malice
interest
and
other
similar
causes
but
also
because
of
the
incapacity
of
the
readers
and
their
inability
to
comprehend
the
certainty
of
the
principles
the
correctness
of
the
deductions
and
conclusions
and
the
general
fitness
sufficiency
and
truth
of
the
reasoning
put
forward
it
often
happens
that
philosophical
writings
of
the
most
sublime
nature
are
accused
of
obscurity
not
necessarily
because
they
are
obscure
but
either
because
their
vein
of
thought
is
of
too
profound
or
novel
a
nature
to
be
easily
intelligible
or
because
the
reader
himself
is
too
dense
to
be
a
competent
judge
of
such
works
think
then
how
difficult
it
must
be
to
gain
praise
for
philosophical
writings
however
meritorious
they
may
be
for
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
number
of
really
profound
philosophers
who
alone
can
appreciate
one
another
is
in
the
present
day
very
small
although
philosophy
is
more
cultivated
than
in
past
times
i
will
not
refer
to
the
various
sects
into
which
those
who
profess
philosophy
are
divided
each
sect
ordinarily
refuses
to
allow
that
there
is
aught
estimable
in
the
others
this
is
not
only
from
unwillingness
but
also
because
it
occupies
itself
with
different
principles
of
philosophy
chapter
viii
if
as
the
result
of
your
learning
and
meditation
you
chanced
to
discover
some
important
truth
not
only
formerly
unknown
but
quite
unlooked
for
and
even
antagonistic
to
the
opinions
of
the
day
you
must
not
anticipate
in
your
lifetime
any
peculiar
commendation
for
this
discovery
you
will
gain
no
esteem
even
from
the
wise
except
perhaps
from
a
very
few
until
by
frequent
and
varied
reiteration
of
these
truths
the
ears
of
men
have
become
accustomed
to
their
sound
then
only
after
a
long
time
the
intellect
begins
to
receive
them
for
no
truth
contrary
to
current
opinion
even
though
demonstrable
with
almost
geometrical
certitude
can
ever
unless
capable
of
material
proof
be
suddenly
established
time
custom
and
example
alone
are
able
to
give
it
a
solid
foundation
men
accustom
themselves
to
belief
as
to
everything
else
indeed
they
generally
believe
from
habit
and
not
from
any
sentiment
of
conviction
within
their
minds
at
length
it
happens
that
the
truth
is
taught
to
children
and
is
universally
accepted
people
are
then
astonished
that
it
was
ever
unknown
to
them
and
they
ridicule
their
ancestors
and
contemporaries
for
the
ignorance
and
obstinacy
they
manifested
in
opposing
it
the
greater
and
more
important
the
new
truths
so
much
the
greater
will
be
the
difficulty
of
procuring
acceptance
for
them
since
they
will
overthrow
a
proportionately
large
number
of
opinions
hitherto
rooted
in
the
minds
of
men
for
even
acute
and
practised
intellects
do
not
easily
enter
into
the
spirit
of
reasonings
which
demonstrate
new
truths
that
exceed
the
limits
of
their
own
knowledge
especially
when
these
are
opposed
to
beliefs
long
established
within
them
descartes
in
his
geometrical
discoveries
was
understood
by
but
very
few
of
his
contemporaries
it
was
the
same
with
newton
indeed
the
condition
of
men
in
knowledge
is
somewhat
similar
to
that
of
literary
men
and
who
live
in
places
innocent
of
learning
the
latter
are
not
deservedly
esteemed
by
their
neighbours
the
former
fail
to
be
duly
appreciated
by
their
contemporaries
both
are
often
despised
for
their
difference
in
manner
of
life
and
opinions
from
other
men
who
neither
do
justice
to
their
ability
nor
to
the
writings
they
put
forth
in
proof
of
it
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
human
race
makes
continual
progress
in
knowledge
as
a
body
its
march
is
slow
and
measured
but
it
includes
certain
great
and
remarkable
minds
which
having
devoted
themselves
to
speculation
about
the
sensible
or
intelligible
phenomena
of
the
universe
and
the
pursuit
of
truths
travel
nay
sometimes
flash
to
their
conclusions
in
an
immeasurably
short
space
of
time
and
the
rapid
progress
of
these
intellects
stimulates
other
men
who
hasten
their
so
as
to
reach
later
on
the
place
where
these
superior
beings
rested
but
not
until
the
lapse
of
a
century
or
more
do
they
attain
to
the
knowledge
possessed
by
an
extraordinary
intellect
of
this
kind
it
is
ordinarily
believed
that
human
knowledge
owes
most
of
its
progress
to
these
supreme
intellects
which
arise
from
time
to
time
like
miracles
of
nature
i
on
the
contrary
think
that
it
owes
more
to
men
of
common
powers
than
to
those
who
are
exceptionally
endowed
suppose
a
case
in
which
one
of
the
latter
having
rivalled
his
contemporaries
in
knowledge
advances
independently
and
takes
a
lead
of
say
ten
paces
most
other
men
far
from
feeling
disposed
to
follow
him
regard
his
progress
in
silence
or
else
ridicule
it
meanwhile
a
number
of
moderately
clever
men
partly
aided
perhaps
by
the
ideas
and
discoveries
of
the
genius
but
principally
through
their
own
endeavours
conjointly
advance
one
step
the
masses
unhesitatingly
follow
them
being
attracted
by
the
not
inordinate
novelty
and
also
by
the
number
of
those
who
are
its
authors
in
process
of
time
thanks
to
the
exertions
of
these
men
the
tenth
step
is
accomplished
and
thus
the
opinions
of
the
genius
are
universally
received
throughout
the
civilised
world
but
their
originator
dead
long
ago
only
acquires
a
late
and
unseasonable
reputation
this
is
due
partly
to
the
fact
that
he
is
forgotten
or
to
the
low
esteem
in
which
he
was
held
when
living
added
to
which
men
are
conscious
that
they
do
not
owe
their
knowledge
to
him
and
that
they
are
already
his
equals
in
erudition
and
will
soon
surpass
him
if
they
have
not
done
so
already
they
are
also
his
superiors
in
that
time
has
enabled
them
to
demonstrate
and
affirm
truths
that
he
only
imagined
to
prove
his
conjectures
and
give
better
form
and
order
to
his
inventions
almost
as
it
were
maturing
them
perchance
after
a
time
some
student
engaged
in
historical
research
may
justly
appraise
the
influence
of
this
genius
and
may
announce
him
to
his
countrymen
with
great
but
the
fame
that
may
ensue
from
this
will
soon
give
way
to
renewed
oblivion
the
progress
of
human
knowledge
like
a
falling
weight
increases
momentarily
in
its
speed
none
the
less
very
rarely
men
of
a
generation
change
their
beliefs
or
recognise
their
errors
so
as
to
believe
at
one
time
the
opposite
of
what
they
previously
believed
each
generation
prepares
the
way
for
its
successor
to
know
and
believe
many
things
contrary
to
its
own
knowledge
and
belief
but
most
men
are
as
little
conscious
of
the
increasing
development
of
their
knowledge
and
the
inevitable
mutation
of
their
beliefs
as
they
are
sensible
of
the
perpetual
motion
of
the
earth
and
a
man
never
alters
his
opinions
so
as
to
be
conscious
of
the
alteration
but
were
he
suddenly
to
embrace
an
opinion
totally
discordant
with
his
old
beliefs
he
could
not
fail
to
perceive
the
change
it
may
therefore
be
said
that
ordinarily
no
truths
except
such
as
are
determinable
by
the
senses
will
be
believed
by
the
contemporaries
of
their
discoverer
footnote
it
is
in
the
order
of
providence
that
the
inventive
generative
constitutive
mind
should
come
first
and
then
that
the
patient
and
collective
mind
should
follow
and
elaborate
the
pregnant
queries
and
illumining
guesses
of
the
former
coleridge
chapter
ix
now
let
us
suppose
that
every
difficulty
be
overcome
and
that
aided
by
fortune
you
have
actually
in
your
lifetime
acquired
not
only
celebrity
but
glory
what
will
be
the
fruit
of
this
in
the
first
place
men
will
wish
to
see
you
and
make
your
acquaintance
they
will
indicate
you
as
a
distinguished
man
and
will
honour
you
in
every
possible
way
such
are
the
best
results
of
literary
glory
it
would
seem
more
natural
to
look
for
such
demonstrations
in
small
than
in
large
towns
for
these
latter
are
subject
to
the
distracting
influence
of
wealth
and
power
and
all
the
arts
which
serve
to
amuse
and
enliven
the
inactive
hours
of
men
lives
but
because
small
towns
are
ordinarily
wanting
in
things
necessary
to
stimulate
literary
excellence
they
are
rarely
the
abode
of
men
devoted
to
literature
and
study
the
people
of
such
places
esteem
learning
and
wisdom
and
even
the
fame
men
seek
by
these
means
at
a
very
low
value
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
are
objects
of
envy
to
them
and
if
a
man
who
is
a
distinguished
scholar
take
up
his
residence
in
a
small
town
his
notability
is
of
no
advantage
to
him
rather
the
contrary
for
though
his
fame
would
secure
him
high
honour
in
towns
not
far
distant
he
is
there
regarded
as
the
most
forlorn
and
obscure
individual
in
the
place
just
as
a
man
who
possessed
nothing
but
an
abundance
of
silver
and
gold
would
be
even
poorer
than
other
men
in
a
place
where
these
metals
were
valueless
similarly
a
wise
and
studious
man
who
makes
his
abode
in
a
place
where
learning
and
genius
are
unknown
far
from
being
considered
superior
to
other
men
will
be
despised
and
scornfully
treated
unless
he
happen
to
have
some
more
material
possessions
yet
such
a
man
is
often
given
credit
for
possessing
much
greater
knowledge
than
he
really
has
though
this
reputation
does
not
procure
him
any
especial
honour
from
these
people
when
i
was
a
young
man
i
used
occasionally
to
return
to
bosisio
my
native
place
every
one
there
knew
that
i
spent
my
time
in
study
and
writing
the
peasants
gave
me
credit
for
being
poet
philosopher
doctor
mathematician
lawyer
theologian
and
sufficiently
a
linguist
to
know
all
the
languages
in
the
world
they
used
to
question
me
indiscriminately
on
any
subject
or
about
any
trifle
that
chanced
to
enter
their
minds
yet
they
did
not
hold
me
in
much
esteem
and
thought
me
less
instructed
than
the
learned
people
of
all
other
places
but
whenever
i
gave
them
reason
to
think
my
learning
was
not
as
extensive
as
they
supposed
i
fell
vastly
in
their
estimation
and
in
the
end
they
used
to
persuade
themselves
that
after
all
my
knowledge
was
no
greater
than
theirs
we
have
already
noticed
the
difficulties
to
be
overcome
in
large
towns
before
glory
can
be
acquired
or
the
fruit
of
it
enjoyed
i
will
now
add
that
although
no
fame
is
more
difficult
to
merit
than
that
of
being
an
excellent
poet
writer
or
philosopher
nothing
is
less
lucrative
to
the
possessor
you
know
that
the
misery
and
poverty
of
the
greatest
poets
both
in
ancient
and
modern
times
is
proverbial
homer
like
his
poetry
is
involved
in
mystery
his
country
life
and
history
are
an
impenetrable
secret
to
men
but
amid
this
uncertainty
and
ignorance
there
is
an
unshaken
tradition
that
homer
was
poor
and
unhappy
it
is
as
if
time
wished
to
bear
witness
that
the
fate
of
other
noble
poets
was
shared
by
the
prince
of
poetry
but
passing
over
the
other
benefits
of
glory
we
will
simply
consider
what
is
called
honour
no
part
of
fame
is
usually
less
honourable
and
more
useless
than
this
it
may
be
that
so
many
people
obtain
it
undeservedly
or
even
because
of
the
extreme
difficulty
of
meriting
it
at
all
certain
it
is
that
such
reputation
is
scarce
esteemed
if
regarded
as
trustworthy
or
perhaps
it
is
due
to
the
fact
that
most
clever
men
imagine
they
either
are
or
could
easily
become
as
proficient
in
literature
and
philosophy
as
those
who
are
successful
in
these
studies
and
whom
they
accordingly
treat
as
on
an
intellectual
equality
possibly
both
causes
combine
in
their
influence
it
is
certain
however
that
the
man
who
is
an
ordinary
mathematician
natural
philosopher
philologist
antiquary
artist
sculptor
musician
or
who
has
only
a
moderate
acquaintance
with
a
single
ancient
or
foreign
language
is
usually
more
respected
even
in
large
towns
than
a
really
remarkable
philosopher
poet
or
writer
consequently
poetry
and
philosophy
the
noblest
grandest
and
most
arduous
of
things
pertaining
to
humanity
and
the
supreme
efforts
of
art
and
science
are
in
the
present
day
the
most
neglected
faculties
in
the
world
even
in
their
professed
followers
manual
arts
rank
higher
than
these
noble
things
for
no
one
would
pretend
to
a
knowledge
of
them
unless
he
really
possessed
it
nor
could
this
knowledge
be
acquired
without
study
and
exertion
in
short
the
poet
and
the
philosopher
derive
no
benefit
in
life
from
their
genius
and
studies
except
perhaps
the
glory
rendered
to
them
by
a
very
few
people
poetry
and
philosophy
resemble
each
other
in
that
they
are
both
as
unproductive
and
barren
of
esteem
and
honour
as
of
all
other
advantages

from
men
you
will
scarcely
derive
any
advantage
whatever
from
your
glory
you
will
therefore
look
within
you
for
consolation
and
in
your
solitude
will
nerve
yourself
for
fresh
exertions
and
lay
the
foundation
of
new
hopes
for
like
all
other
human
benefits
literary
glory
is
more
pleasing
in
anticipation
than
in
reality
if
indeed
it
can
ever
be
said
to
be
realised
you
will
therefore
at
length
console
yourself
with
the
thought
of
that
last
hope
and
refuge
of
noble
minds
posterity
even
cicero
richly
renowned
as
he
was
in
life
turned
his
mind
yearningly
towards
the
future
in
saying
thou
i
should
have
undertaken
so
many
labours
during
day
and
night
in
peace
and
war
had
i
imagined
my
glory
was
limited
to
this
life
far
better
were
a
life
of
idleness
and
peace
devoid
of
cares
and
fatigue
no
my
soul
in
some
inexplicable
way
used
ever
to
fix
its
hopes
on
posterity
and
looked
for
the
dawn
of
its
true
life
from
the
hour
of
death
cicero
here
refers
to
the
idea
of
immortality
innate
in
the
minds
of
men
but
the
true
explanation
lies
in
the
fact
that
all
earthly
benefits
are
no
sooner
acquired
than
their
insignificance
becomes
apparent
they
are
unworthy
of
the
fatigues
they
have
cost
glory
is
above
all
an
example
of
this
it
is
a
dear
purchase
and
of
little
use
to
the
purchaser
but
as
simonides
says
i
sweet
hope
cheers
us
with
its
phantom
beauties
and
with
its
vain
prospect
stimulates
us
to
work
some
men
await
the
friendly
dawn
others
the
advance
of
age
and
others
more
auspicious
seasons
every
mortal
cherishes
within
him
hopes
of
coming
good
from
pluto
and
the
other
gods
thus
as
we
experience
the
vanity
of
glory
hope
driven
and
hunted
from
place
to
place
finding
at
length
no
spot
in
the
whole
of
life
whereon
to
rest
passes
beyond
the
grave
and
alights
on
posterity
for
man
ever
turns
instinctively
from
the
present
to
the
future
about
which
he
hopes
much
in
proportion
as
he
knows
little
hence
they
who
are
desirous
of
glory
in
life
chiefly
nourish
themselves
on
that
which
they
hope
to
gain
after
death
for
the
lack
of
enjoyment
in
the
present
man
consoles
himself
with
hopes
of
future
happiness
as
vain
as
that
of
the
present
footnote
de
senectute
chapter
xi
but
what
after
all
is
this
appeal
that
we
make
to
posterity
the
human
imagination
is
such
that
it
forms
a
more
exalted
conception
of
posterity
than
of
the
men
of
past
or
present
times
simply
because
we
are
totally
ignorant
of
the
people
who
are
yet
to
be
but
reasonably
and
not
imaginatively
do
we
really
think
our
successors
will
be
better
than
ourselves
i
am
of
a
contrary
opinion
and
for
my
part
put
faith
in
the
proverb
that
says
world
grows
worse
as
it
ages
it
were
better
for
men
of
genius
if
they
could
appeal
to
their
wise
ancestors
who
according
to
cicero
were
not
inferior
in
point
of
numbers
and
far
superior
in
excellence
to
their
successors
but
though
such
appeal
would
be
sure
of
a
truer
judgment
it
is
certain
that
the
greatest
men
of
our
day
would
be
held
in
little
esteem
by
the
ancients
it
may
be
allowed
that
the
men
of
the
future
being
free
from
any
spirit
of
rivalry
envy
love
or
hatred
not
indeed
amongst
themselves
but
towards
us
ought
to
be
better
qualified
than
ourselves
to
pass
impartial
judgment
on
our
writings
for
other
reasons
too
they
may
be
better
judges
posterity
will
perhaps
have
fewer
excellent
writers
noble
poets
and
subtle
philosophers
in
which
case
the
few
followers
of
these
sublime
influences
will
honour
us
the
more
it
is
also
probable
that
their
control
over
the
minds
of
the
people
will
be
still
less
than
that
exercised
by
us
again
will
the
affections
imagination
and
intellect
of
men
be
as
a
rule
more
powerful
than
they
are
at
present
if
not
we
shall
gain
by
the
comparison
literature
is
peculiarly
exposed
to
the
influence
of
custom
in
times
of
debased
literature
we
see
how
firmly
this
or
that
barbarism
is
retained
and
upheld
as
though
it
alone
were
reasonable
and
natural
at
such
times
the
best
and
greatest
writers
are
forgotten
or
ridiculed
where
then
is
the
certainty
that
posterity
will
always
esteem
the
kind
of
writing
that
we
praise
besides
it
is
a
question
whether
or
not
we
ourselves
esteem
what
is
really
praiseworthy
for
men
have
different
opinions
about
what
constitutes
good
writing
and
these
vary
according
to
the
times
the
nature
of
places
and
people
customs
usages
and
individuals
yet
it
is
to
this
variety
and
variability
of
influences
that
the
glory
of
writers
is
subjected
philosophy
is
even
more
diverse
and
changeable
than
other
sciences
at
first
sight
the
contrary
of
this
would
seem
to
be
true
for
whereas
the
lettres
are
concerned
with
the
study
of
the
beautiful
which
is
chiefly
a
matter
of
custom
and
opinion
sciences
seek
the
truth
which
is
fixed
and
unchangeable
but
this
truth
is
hid
from
mortals
though
as
centuries
go
by
some
little
of
it
is
revealed
consequently
on
the
one
hand
in
their
endeavours
to
discover
it
and
their
conjectures
as
to
its
nature
men
are
led
to
embrace
this
or
that
resemblance
of
truth
thereupon
opinions
and
sects
multiply
and
on
the
other
hand
it
is
due
to
the
number
of
fresh
discoveries
and
new
aspects
of
truth
obtained
daily
that
even
these
divisions
become
subdivided
and
opinions
which
at
one
time
were
regarded
almost
as
certainties
change
shape
and
substance
momentarily
it
is
owing
to
the
changeability
of
sciences
and
philosophy
that
they
are
so
unproductive
of
glory
either
at
the
hands
of
contemporaries
or
posterity
for
when
new
discoveries
or
new
ideas
and
conjectures
greatly
alter
the
condition
of
this
or
that
science
from
its
present
state
how
will
the
writings
and
thoughts
of
men
now
celebrated
in
these
sciences
be
regarded
who
for
instance
now
reads
works
yet
in
his
time
they
were
most
wonderful
nor
could
better
and
nobler
books
full
of
greater
discoveries
and
grander
conceptions
be
then
written
on
such
subjects
but
now
every
tyro
in
physics
or
mathematics
surpasses
galileo
in
his
knowledge
again
how
many
people
in
the
present
day
read
the
writings
of
francis
bacon
who
troubles
himself
about
malebranche
and
how
much
time
will
soon
be
bestowed
on
the
works
of
locke
if
the
science
almost
founded
by
him
progresses
in
future
as
rapidly
as
it
gives
promise
of
doing
truly
the
very
intellectual
force
industry
and
labour
which
philosophers
and
scientists
expend
in
the
pursuit
of
their
glory
are
in
time
the
cause
of
its
extinction
or
obscurément
for
by
their
own
great
exertions
they
open
out
a
path
for
the
still
further
advancement
of
the
science
which
in
time
progresses
so
rapidly
that
their
writings
and
names
fall
gradually
into
oblivion
and
it
is
certainly
difficult
for
most
men
to
esteem
others
for
a
knowledge
greatly
inferior
to
their
own
who
can
doubt
that
the
twentieth
century
will
discover
error
in
what
the
wisest
of
us
regard
as
unquestionable
truths
and
will
surpass
us
greatly
in
their
knowledge
of
the
truth
footnote
compare
the
following
from
rogers

the
condition
of

far
less
enviable
than
that
of
great

the
former

never
possess
so
large
a
circle
of
readers
under
any
circumstances
but
that
number
is
still
further
abridged
by
the
fact
that
even
the

finally
you
would
perhaps
like
to
know
my
opinion
and
decided
advice
to
you
about
your
intended
profession
the
question
is
one
as
to
the
advisability
of
your
pursuing
or
abandoning
this
path
to
glory
a
thing
so
poor
in
usefulness
and
so
hard
and
uncertain
both
to
secure
and
retain
that
it
may
be
compared
to
a
shadow
which
you
can
neither
feel
when
you
hold
nor
yet
keep
from
fleeing
away
i
will
tell
you
then
briefly
my
true
opinion
i
consider
your
wonderful
genius
noble
disposition
and
prolific
imagination
to
be
the
most
fatal
and
lamentable
qualities
distributed
by
fortune
to
humanity
but
since
you
possess
them
you
will
scarcely
be
able
to
avoid
their
harmful
influence
in
the
present
day
there
is
but
one
possible
benefit
to
be
gained
from
such
endowments
as
yours
the
glory
that
sometimes
rewards
industry
in
literature
and
study
you
know
those
miserable
men
who
having
accidentally
lost
or
injured
a
limb
try
to
make
as
much
profit
as
possible
from
their
misfortune
which
they
ostentatiously
display
to
excite
the
pity
and
consequent
liberality
of
in
the
same
way
i
advise
you
to
endeavour
to
procure
by
means
of
your
endowments
the
only
possible
advantage
trifling
and
uncertain
though
it
be
such
qualities
as
yours
are
usually
regarded
as
great
natural
gifts
and
are
often
envied
by
those
who
do
not
possess
them
but
this
feeling
is
opposed
to
common
sense
as
well
may
the
sound
man
envy
those
wretched
fellows
their
bodily
calamities
or
wish
to
mutilate
himself
in
the
same
way
for
the
sake
of
the
miserable
profit
he
might
gain
most
men
work
as
long
as
they
can
and
enjoy
themselves
as
much
as
their
nature
will
permit
but
great
writers
are
naturally
and
by
their
manner
of
life
incapable
of
many
human
pleasures
voluntarily
deprived
of
many
others
often
despised
by
their
save
perhaps
a
very
few
who
pursue
the
same
studies
they
are
destined
to
lead
a
life
like
unto
death
and
to
live
only
beyond
the
grave
if
even
that
be
granted
them
but
destiny
must
be
obeyed
duty
commands
us
to
follow
it
courageously
and
nobly
whithersoever
it
may
lead
us
such
resignation
is
especially
necessary
for
you
and
those
who
resemble
you
between
frederic
ruysch
and
his
of
the
dead
in

o

thou
one
eternal

that
takest
all
within
thine
arms
in
thee
our
coarser

in
peace
set
free
from

alarms
joyless
and
painless
is
our

our
spirits
now
no

hope

are
now
unknown
nor
know
we
aught
of

time
flows
in
one
unbroken
stream
as
void
of
ennui
as
a
dream
the
troubles
we
on
earth
endured
have
vanished
yet
we
sometimes
see
their
phantom
shapes
as
in
a
mist
of
mingled
thought
and
memory
they
now
can
vex
our
souls
no
more
what
is
that
life
we
lived
on
earth
a
mystery
now
it
seems
to
be
profound
as
is
the
thought
of
death
to
wearers
of
mortality
and
as
from
death
the
living
flee
so
from
the
vital
flame
flee
we
our
portion
now
is

joyless

we

diamine
who
has
been
teaching
these
dead
folks
music
that
they
thus
sing
like
cocks
at
midnight
verily
i
am
in
a
cold
sweat
and
nearly
as
dead
as
themselves
i
little
thought
when
i
preserved
them
from
decay
that
they
would
come
to
life
again
so
it
is
however
and
with
all
my
philosophy
i
tremble
from
head
to
foot
it
was
an
evil
spirit
that
induced
me
to
take
these
gentry
in
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
if
i
leave
them
shut
in
here
they
may
break
open
the
door
or
pass
through
the
keyhole
and
come
to
me
in
bed
yet
i
do
not
like
to
show
that
i
am
afraid
of
the
dead
by
calling
for
help
i
will
be
brave
let
us
see
if
i
can
not
make
them
afraid
in
their
turn
children
children
what
game
are
you
playing
at
do
you
not
remember
that
you
are
dead
what
does
all
this
uproar
mean
are
you
so
puffed
up
because
of
the
czar
visit
that
you
imagine
yourselves
no
longer
subject
to
the
laws
of
nature
i
am
presuming
this
commotion
is
simply
a
piece
of
pleasantry
on
your
part
and
that
there
is
nothing
serious
about
it
if
however
you
are
truly
resuscitated
i
congratulate
you
although
i
must
tell
you
that
i
can
not
afford
to
keep
you
living
as
well
as
dead
and
in
that
case
you
must
leave
my
house
at
once
or
if
what
they
say
about
vampires
be
true
and
you
are
some
of
them
be
good
enough
to
seek
other
blood
to
drink
for
i
am
not
disposed
to
let
you
suck
mine
with
which
i
have
already
liberally
filled
your
veins
in
short
if
you
will
continue
to
be
quiet
and
silent
as
before
we
shall
get
on
very
well
together
and
you
shall
want
for
nothing
in
my
house
otherwise
i
warn
you
that
i
will
take
hold
of
this
iron
bar
and
kill
you
one
and
all
do
not
put
yourself
about
i
promise
you
we
will
all
be
dead
again
without
your
killing
us
then
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
singing
freak
a
moment
ago
precisely
at
midnight
was
completed
for
the
first
time
that
great
mathematical
epoch
referred
to
so
often
by
the
ancients
also
the
dead
have
spoken
for
the
first
time
and
all
the
dead
in
every
cemetery
and
sepulchre
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
beneath
the
snow
and
the
sand
under
the
open
sky
and
wherever
they
are
to
be
found
have
like
us
chanted
the
song
you
have
just
heard
and
how
long
will
your
singing
or
speaking
last
the
song
is
already
finished
we
are
allowed
to
speak
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
we
are
silent
again
until
the
completion
of
the
second
great
year
if
this
be
true
i
do
not
think
you
will
disturb
my
sleep
a
second
time
so
talk
away
to
your
hearts
content
and
i
will
stand
here
on
one
side
and
from
curiosity
gladly
listen
without
interrupting
you
we
can
only
speak
in
response
to
some
living
person
the
dead
that
are
not
interrogated
by
the
living
when
they
have
finished
their
song
are
quiet
again
i
am
greatly
disappointed
for
i
was
curious
to
know
what
you
would
talk
about
if
you
could
converse
with
each
other
even
if
we
could
do
so
you
would
hear
nothing
because
we
should
have
nothing
to
say
to
one
another
a
thousand
questions
to
ask
you
come
into
my
mind
but
the
time
is
short
so
tell
me
briefly
what
feelings
you
experienced
in
body
and
soul
when
at
the
point
of
death
i
do
not
remember
the
exact
moment
of
death
other
nor
do
we
why
not
for
the
same
reason
that
you
can
not
perceive
the
moment
when
you
fall
asleep
however
much
you
try
to
do
so
but
sleep
is
a
natural
thing
and
does
not
death
seem
natural
to
you
show
me
a
man
beast
or
plant
that
shall
not
die
i
am
no
longer
surprised
that
you
sing
and
talk
if
you
do
not
remember
your
death
a
fatal
blow
deprived
him
of
his
breath
still
fought
he
on
unconscious
of
his
death
as
says
an
italian
poet
i
thought
that
on
the
subject
of
death
you
fellows
would
at
least
know
something
more
than
the
living
now
tell
me
did
you
feel
any
pain
at
the
point
of
death
how
can
there
be
pain
at
a
time
of
unconsciousness
at
any
rate
every
one
believes
the
moment
of
departure
from
this
life
to
be
a
very
painful
one
as
if
death
were
a
sensation
and
not
rather
the
contrary
most
people
who
hold
the
views
of
the
epicureans
as
to
the
nature
of
the
soul
as
well
as
those
who
cling
to
the
popular
opinion
agree
in
supposing
that
death
is
essentially
a
pain
of
the
most
acute
kind
well
you
shall
put
the
question
to
either
of
them
from
us
if
man
be
unaware
of
the
exact
point
of
time
when
his
vital
functions
are
suspended
in
more
or
less
degree
by
sleep
lethargy
syncope
or
any
other
cause
why
should
he
perceive
the
these
same
functions
cease
entirely
and
not
merely
for
a
time
but
for
ever
besides
how
could
there
be
an
acute
sensation
at
the
time
of
death
is
death
itself
a
sensation
when
the
faculty
of
sense
is
not
only
weakened
and
restricted
but
so
minimised
that
it
may
be
termed
how
could
any
one
experience
a
lively
sensation
perhaps
you
think
this
very
extinction
of
sensibility
ought
also
to
be
an
acute
sensation
but
it
is
not
so
for
you
may
notice
that
even
sick
people
who
die
of
very
painful
diseases
compose
themselves
shortly
before
death
and
rest
in
tranquillity
they
are
too
enfeebled
to
suffer
and
lose
all
sense
of
pain
before
they
die
you
may
say
this
from
us
to
whoever
imagines
it
will
be
a
painful
effort
to
breathe
his
last
such
reasoning
would
perhaps
satisfy
the
epicureans
but
not
those
people
who
regard
the
soul
as
essentially
different
from
the
body
i
have
hitherto
been
one
of
the
latter
and
now
that
i
have
heard
the
dead
speak
and
sing
i
am
more
than
ever
disinclined
to
change
my
opinions
we
consider
death
to
be
a
separation
of
the
soul
and
body
and
to
us
it
is
incomprehensible
how
these
two
substances
so
joined
and
agglutinated
as
to
form
one
being
can
be
divided
without
great
force
and
an
inconceivable
pang
tell
me
is
the
spirit
joined
to
the
body
by
some
nerve
muscle
or
membrane
which
must
be
broken
to
enable
it
to
escape
or
is
it
a
member
which
has
to
be
severed
or
violently
wrenched
away
do
you
not
see
that
the
soul
necessarily
leaves
the
body
when
the
latter
becomes
uninhabitable
and
not
because
of
any
internal
violence
tell
me
also
were
you
sensible
of
the
moment
when
the
soul
entered
you
and
was
joined
or
as
you
say
agglutinated
to
your
body
if
not
why
should
you
expect
to
feel
any
violent
sensation
at
its
departure
take
my
word
for
it
the
departure
of
the
soul
is
as
quiet
and
imperceptible
as
its
entrance
then
what
is
death
if
it
be
not
pain
it
is
rather
pleasure
than
anything
else
you
must
know
that
death
like
sleep
is
not
accomplished
in
a
moment
but
gradually
it
is
true
the
transition
is
more
or
less
rapid
according
to
the
disease
or
manner
of
death
but
ultimately
death
comes
like
sleep
without
either
sense
of
pain
or
pleasure
just
before
death
pain
is
impossible
for
it
is
too
acute
a
thing
to
be
experienced
by
the
enfeebled
senses
of
a
dying
person
it
were
more
rational
to
regard
it
as
a
pleasure
because
most
human
joys
far
from
being
of
a
lively
nature
are
made
up
of
a
sort
of
languor
in
which
pain
has
no
part
consequently
senses
even
when
approaching
extinction
are
capable
of
pleasure
since
languor
is
often
pleasurable
especially
when
it
succeeds
a
state
of
suffering
hence
the
languor
of
death
ought
to
be
pleasing
in
proportion
to
the
intensity
of
pain
from
which
it
frees
the
sufferer
as
for
myself
if
i
can
not
recall
the
circumstances
of
my
death
it
may
be
because
the
doctors
forbade
me
to
exert
my
brain
i
remember
however
that
the
sensation
i
experienced
differed
little
from
the
feeling
of
satisfaction
that
steals
over
a
man
as
the
languor
of
sleep
pervades
him
other
we
felt
the
same
sensation
it
may
be
as
you
say
although
every
one
with
whom
i
have
conversed
on
this
subject
is
of
a
very
different
opinion
it
is
true
however
they
have
not
spoken
from
experience
now
tell
me
did
you
at
the
time
of
death
whilst
experiencing
this
sensation
of
pleasure
realise
that
you
were
dying
and
that
this
feeling
was
a
prelude
to
death
or
what
did
you
think
until
i
was
dead
i
believed
i
should
recover
and
as
long
as
i
had
the
faculty
of
thought
i
hoped
i
should
still
live
an
hour
or
two
i
imagine
most
people
think
the
same
other
it
was
the
same
with
us

however
old
and
a
man
may
be
he
always
anticipates

did
you
perceive
at

that
your
soul
had
left

ottonieri
a
few
of
whose
remarkable
sayings
i
am
about
to
recount
partly
heard
from
his
own
mouth
and
partly
related
to
me
by
others
was
born
at
nubiana
in
the
province
of
valdivento
there
he
lived
most
of
his
life
and
died
a
short
time
ago
leaving
behind
him
the
reputation
of
having
never
injured
any
one
either
by
word
or
deed
he
was
detested
by
the
majority
of
his
because
he
took
so
little
interest
in
the
many
things
that
gave
them
pleasure
although
he
did
nothing
to
show
that
he
despised
those
who
differed
from
himself
in
this
respect
he
is
believed
to
have
been
not
only
in
theory
but
also
in
practice
what
so
many
of
his
contemporaries
professed
to
be
that
is
a
philosopher
for
this
reason
other
men
thought
him
peculiar
though
really
he
never
affected
singularity
in
anything
indeed
he
once
said
that
a
man
who
nowadays
practised
the
greatest
possible
singularity
in
dress
manners
or
actions
would
be
far
less
singular
than
were
those
ancients
who
obtained
a
reputation
for
singularity
and
that
the
difference
between
such
a
person
and
his
contemporaries
would
by
the
ancients
have
been
regarded
as
scarcely
worthy
of
notice
and
comparing
rousseau
singularity
which
seemed
very
striking
to
the
people
of
his
generation
with
that
of
democritus
and
the
first
cynic
philosophers
he
said
that
whoever
nowadays
lived
as
differently
from
his
contemporaries
as
these
greeks
lived
from
theirs
would
not
merely
be
regarded
as
singular
but
would
be
treated
as
outside
the
pale
of
human
society
he
thought
too
that
the
degree
of
civilisation
reached
by
any
country
might
be
estimated
from
observation
of
the
degree
of
singularity
possible
in
the
inhabitants
of
that
country
though
very
temperate
in
his
habits
of
life
he
professed
epicureanism
perhaps
lightly
rather
than
from
conviction
but
he
condemned
epicurus
affirming
that
in
his
time
and
nation
there
was
much
more
pleasure
to
be
obtained
from
the
pursuit
of
glory
and
virtue
than
from
idleness
indifference
and
sensuality
which
things
were
considered
by
that
philosopher
to
represent
the
greatest
good
of
life
he
said
also
that
the
epicureanism
of
modern
times
has
nothing
in
common
with
the
epicureanism
of
the
ancients
in
philosophy
he
liked
to
call
himself
socratic
like
socrates
too
he
often
spent
great
part
of
the
day
reasoning
philosophically
with
any
chance
acquaintance
and
especially
with
certain
of
his
friends
on
any
impromptu
subject
but
unlike
socrates
he
did
not
frequent
the
shops
of
the
shoemakers
carpenters
and
blacksmiths
for
he
was
of
opinion
that
though
the
artisans
of
athens
may
have
had
time
to
spend
in
philosophising
those
of
nubiana
would
starve
were
they
to
follow
such
an
example
nor
did
he
like
socrates
explain
his
conclusions
by
means
of
endless
interrogation
and
argument
for
he
said
although
men
in
the
present
day
may
have
more
patience
than
their
ancestors
they
would
never
consent
to
reply
to
a
thousand
consecutive
questions
still
less
to
hear
their
answers
answered
in
fact
he
only
resembled
socrates
in
his
manner
of
speaking
sometimes
ironical
sometimes
equivocal
he
analysed
the
famous
socratic
irony
in
the
following
way
socrates
was
naturally
very
and
of
a
most
lovable
disposition
but
he
was
physically
so
unattractive
that
it
is
probable
he
despaired
from
his
youth
of
ever
inspiring
others
with
a
warmer
feeling
than
that
of
friendship
far
insufficient
to
satisfy
his
sensitive
and
ardent
nature
which
often
felt
towards
others
a
much
more
lively
affection
he
was
courageous
in
all
matters
of
the
intellect
but
seems
to
have
been
wanting
in
natural
courage
and
those
other
qualities
that
would
have
enabled
him
to
hold
his
own
in
public
life
amid
the
tumult
of
wars
the
sedition
and
the
license
of
all
kinds
then
characteristic
of
athenian
affairs
in
addition
to
this
his
ridiculous
and
insignificant
figure
must
have
been
no
slight
prejudice
to
him
among
people
who
made
little
distinction
between
the
good
and
the
beautiful
and
who
were
also
much
addicted
to
banter
thus
it
happened
that
in
a
free
city
full
of
wealth
and
the
bustle
and
amusements
of
life
socrates
poor
rejected
by
love
incapable
of
a
public
career
yet
gifted
with
very
great
intelligence
which
doubtless
intensified
the
consciousness
of
his
defects
resigned
himself
to
a
life
of
philosophising
on
the
actions
manners
and
thoughts
of
his
the
irony
he
used
was
natural
to
a
man
who
found
himself
as
it
were
excluded
from
participation
in
the
existence
of
others
but
it
was
due
to
his
inherent
nobility
and
affableness
and
perhaps
also
to
the
celebrity
he
gained
by
his
reasonings
and
which
flattered
his
that
this
irony
instead
of
being
bitter
and
contemptuous
was
pleasing
and
expressed
in
a
friendly
manner
then
it
was
that
philosophy
as
cicero
has
well
said
made
her
first
descent
from
heaven
and
was
led
by
socrates
into
the
towns
and
houses
of
men
hitherto
occupied
with
speculations
as
to
the
nature
of
hidden
things
she
now
studied
the
manners
and
lives
of
men
and
discussed
virtues
and
vices
things
good
and
useful
and
the
contrary
but
socrates
did
not
primarily
think
of
introducing
this
novel
feature
into
philosophy
nor
did
he
propose
to
teach
anything
nor
even
aspire
to
the
name
of
philosopher
which
then
only
belonged
to
those
who
made
physics
or
metaphysics
the
study
of
their
lives
he
openly
proclaimed
his
ignorance
of
all
things
and
in
his
conversation
with
others
simply
discussed
the
affairs
of
his
neighbours
and
the
topics
of
the
day
he
preferred
this
amusement
to
the
real
study
of
philosophy
or
any
other
science
or
art
and
being
naturally
more
inclined
to
act
than
speculate
he
only
adopted
this
manner
of
life
because
shut
out
from
a
more
congenial
employment
he
was
always
more
willing
to
converse
with
young
and
handsome
persons
than
with
others
in
this
way
he
hoped
to
gain
at
least
esteem
where
he
would
far
rather
have
had
love
and
since
all
the
schools
of
greek
philosophy
are
traceable
directly
or
indirectly
to
the
socratic
school
ottonieri
asserted
that
the
flat
nose
and
visage
of
a
highly
intellectual
and
man
were
the
origin
of
all
greek
philosophy
and
consequently
the
philosophy
of
modern
times
he
also
said
that
in
the
writings
of
his
followers
the
individuality
of
socrates
is
comparable
to
those
theatrical
masks
of
the
ancients
which
always
retained
their
name
character
and
identity
but
the
of
which
varied
in
each
distinct
performance
he
left
behind
him
no
philosophical
or
other
writings
for
public
benefit
being
asked
one
day
why
he
did
not
give
written
as
well
as
verbal
expression
to
his
philosophical
views
he
replied
reading
is
a
conversation
held
with
the
writer
now
as
in
fêtes
and
public
entertainments
they
who
take
no
active
part
in
the
spectacle
or
performance
soon
become
tired
similarly
in
conversation
men
prefer
to
speak
rather
than
listen
and
books
necessarily
resemble
those
people
who
take
all
the
speaking
to
themselves
and
never
listen
to
others
consequently
to
atone
for
their
monopoly
of
talking
they
ought
to
say
many
fine
and
excellent
things
expressing
them
in
a
remarkable
manner
every
book
that
does
not
do
this
inspires
the
same
feeling
of
aversion
as
an
insatiable
chatterer
footnote
a
fictitious
personage
chapter
ii
ottonieri
made
no
distinction
between
business
and
pleasure
however
serious
his
occupation
he
called
it
pastime
only
once
having
been
idle
temporarily
he
confessed
he
had
then
experienced
no
amusement
he
said
that
our
truest
pleasures
are
due
to
the
imagination
thus
children
construct
a
world
out
of
nothing
whereas
men
find
nothing
in
the
world
he
compared
those
pleasures
termed
real
to
an
artichoke
all
the
leaves
of
which
must
be
masticated
in
order
to
reach
the
pith
he
added
that
such
artichokes
as
these
are
very
rare
and
that
many
others
resemble
them
in
exterior
but
within
are
void
of
kernel
he
for
his
part
finding
the
leaves
unpalatable
determined
to
abstain
from
both
leaves
and
kernel
being
asked
what
was
the
worst
moment
of
life
he
said
except
those
of
pain
or
fear
the
worst
moments
are
in
my
opinion
those
spent
in
pleasure
for
the
anticipation
and
recollection
of
these
last
which
fill
up
the
remainder
of
life
are
better
and
more
delightful
than
the
pleasures
themselves
he
also
made
a
comparison
between
pleasures
and
odours
the
latter
he
considered
usually
leave
behind
a
desire
to
experience
them
again
proportioned
to
their
agreeableness
and
he
regarded
the
sense
of
smell
as
the
most
difficult
to
satisfy
of
all
our
senses
again
he
compared
odours
to
anticipations
of
good
things
and
said
that
odoriferous
foods
are
generally
more
pleasing
to
the
nose
than
the
palate
for
their
scent
originates
savoury
expectations
which
are
seldom
sufficiently
realised
he
explained
why
sometimes
he
was
so
impatient
about
the
delay
of
a
pleasure
sure
to
occur
sooner
or
later
by
saying
that
he
feared
the
enjoyment
he
should
derive
from
it
would
be
of
diminished
force
on
account
of
the
exaggerated
anticipation
conceived
by
his
mind
for
this
reason
he
endeavoured
in
the
meantime
to
forget
the
coming
good
as
though
it
were
an
impending
misfortune
he
said
that
each
of
us
in
entering
the
world
resembles
a
man
on
a
hard
and
uncomfortable
bed
as
soon
as
the
man
lies
down
he
feels
restless
and
begins
to
toss
from
side
to
side
and
change
his
position
momentarily
in
the
hope
of
inducing
sleep
to
close
his
eyes
thus
he
spends
the
whole
night
and
though
sometimes
he
believes
himself
on
the
point
of
falling
asleep
he
never
actually
succeeds
in
doing
so
at
length
dawn
comes
and
he
rises
unrefreshed
watching
some
bees
at
work
one
day
in
company
with
certain
acquaintances
he
remarked
blessed
are
ye
if
ye
know
not
your
unhappiness
he
considered
the
miseries
of
mortals
to
be
incalculable
and
that
no
single
one
of
them
could
be
adequately
deplored
in
answer
to
horace
question
why
is
no
one
content
with
his
lot
he
said
because
no
one
lot
is
happy
subjects
equally
with
princes
the
weak
and
the
strong
were
they
happy
would
be
contented
and
would
envy
no
one
for
men
are
no
more
incapable
of
being
satisfied
than
other
animals
but
since
happiness
alone
can
satisfy
them
they
are
necessarily
dissatisfied
because
essentially
unhappy
if
a
man
could
be
found
he
said
who
had
attained
to
the
summit
of
human
happiness
that
man
would
be
the
most
miserable
of
mortals
for
even
the
oldest
of
us
have
hopes
and
schemes
for
the
improvement
of
our
condition
he
recalled
a
passage
in
zenophon
where
a
purchaser
of
land
is
advised
to
buy
badly
cultivated
fields
because
such
as
do
not
in
the
future
bring
forth
more
abundantly
than
at
the
time
of
purchase
give
less
satisfaction
than
if
they
were
to
increase
in
productiveness
similarly
all
things
in
which
we
can
observe
improvement
please
us
more
than
others
in
which
improvement
is
impossible
on
the
other
hand
he
observed
that
no
condition
is
so
bad
that
it
can
not
be
worse
and
that
however
unhappy
a
man
may
be
he
can
not
console
or
boast
himself
that
his
misfortunes
are
incapable
of
increase
though
hope
is
unbounded
the
good
things
of
life
are
limited
thus
were
we
to
consider
a
single
day
in
the
life
of
a
rich
or
poor
man
master
or
servant
bearing
in
mind
all
the
circumstances
and
needs
of
their
respective
positions
we
should
generally
find
an
equality
of
good
throughout
but
nature
has
not
limited
our
misfortunes
nor
can
the
mind
scarcely
conceive
a
cause
of
suffering
which
is
or
which
at
some
time
was
not
to
be
found
among
humanity
thus
whereas
most
men
vainly
hope
for
an
increase
of
the
good
things
they
possess
they
never
want
for
genuine
objects
of
fear
and
if
fortune
sometimes
obstinately
refuses
to
benefit
us
in
the
least
degree
she
never
fails
to
afflict
us
with
new
torments
of
such
a
nature
as
to
crush
within
us
even
the
courage
of
despair
he
often
used
to
laugh
at
those
philosophers
who
think
that
a
man
is
able
to
free
himself
from
the
tyranny
of
fortune
by
having
a
contempt
for
good
and
evil
things
which
are
entirely
beyond
his
control
as
if
happiness
and
the
contrary
were
absolutely
in
his
own
power
to
accept
or
refuse
on
the
same
subject
he
also
said
amongst
other
things
that
however
much
a
man
may
act
as
a
philosopher
in
his
relations
with
others
he
is
never
a
philosopher
to
himself
again
he
said
that
it
is
as
impossible
to
take
more
interest
in
the
affairs
of
others
than
in
our
own
as
to
regard
their
affairs
as
though
they
were
our
own
but
supposing
this
philosophical
disposition
of
mind
were
possible
winch
it
is
not
and
possessed
by
one
of
us
how
would
it
stand
the
test
of
a
thousand
trials
would
it
not
be
evident
that
the
happiness
or
unhappiness
of
such
a
person
is
nevertheless
a
matter
of
fortune
would
not
the
very
disposition
they
boast
of
be
dependent
on
circumstances
is
not
man
reason
daily
governed
by
accidents
of
all
kinds
do
not
the
numberless
bodily
disturbances
due
to
stupidity
excitement
madness
rage
dullness
and
a
hundred
other
species
of
folly
temporary
or
continuous
trouble
weaken
distract
and
even
extinguish
it
does
not
memory
wisdom
ally
lose
strength
as
we
advance
in
age
how
many
of
us
fall
into
a
second
childhood
and
we
almost
all
decrease
in
mental
vigour
as
we
grow
old
or
when
our
mind
remains
unimpaired
time
by
means
of
some
bodily
disease
enfeebles
our
courage
and
firmness
and
not
infrequently
deprives
us
of
both
attributes
altogether
in
short
it
is
utter
folly
to
confess
that
physically
we
are
subject
to
many
things
over
which
we
have
no
control
and
at
the
same
time
to
assert
that
the
mind
which
is
so
greatly
dependent
on
the
body
is
not
similarly
controlled
by
external
influences
he
summed
up
by
saying
that
man
as
a
whole
is
absolutely
in
the
power
of
fortune
being
asked
for
what
purpose
he
thought
men
were
born
he
laughingly
replied
to
realise
how
much
better
it
were
not
to
be
born
chapter
iii
on
the
occasion
of
a
certain
misfortune
ottonieri
said
it
is
less
hard
to
lose
a
person
suddenly
or
after
a
short
illness
than
to
see
him
waste
away
gradually
so
that
before
his
death
he
is
transformed
in
body
and
mind
into
quite
another
being
from
what
he
formerly
was
this
latter
is
a
cruel
thing
for
the
beloved
one
instead
of
leaving
to
us
the
tender
recollections
of
his
real
identity
remains
with
us
a
changed
being
in
whose
presence
our
old
affection
slowly
but
surely
fades
away
at
length
he
dies
but
the
remembrance
of
him
as
he
was
at
the
last
destroys
the
sweeter
and
earlier
image
within
us
thus
he
is
lost
entirely
and
our
imagination
instead
of
comforting
saddens
us
such
misfortunes
as
these
are
inconsolable
one
day
he
heard
a
man
lamenting
and
saying
if
only
i
were
freed
from
this
trouble
all
my
other
troubles
would
be
easy
to
bear
he
replied
not
so
for
then
those
that
are
now
light
would
be
heavy
another
person
said
to
him
had
this
pain
continued
i
could
not
have
borne
it
ottonieri
answered
on
the
contrary
habit
would
have
made
it
more
bearable
touching
many
things
as
to
human
nature
he
held
opinions
not
in
accordance
with
those
of
the
multitude
and
often
different
from
those
of
learned
men
for
instance
he
thought
it
unwise
to
address
a
petition
to
any
one
when
the
person
addressed
is
in
a
state
of
extraordinary
hilarity
and
he
said
when
the
petition
is
such
that
it
can
not
be
granted
at
once
i
consider
occasions
of
joy
and
sorrow
as
equally
inopportune
to
its
success
for
both
sentiments
make
a
man
too
selfish
to
trouble
himself
with
the
affairs
of
others
in
sorrow
our
misfortune
in
joy
our
good
fortune
monopolises
our
mind
and
erects
as
it
were
a
barrier
between
us
and
matters
external
to
ourselves
both
are
also
peculiarly
unsuitable
for
exciting
compassion
when
sorrowful
we
reserve
all
pity
for
ourselves
when
joyful
we
colour
all
things
with
our
joy
and
are
inclined
to
regard
the
troubles
and
misfortunes
of
others
as
entirely
imaginative
or
else
we
refuse
to
think
of
them
as
too
discordant
with
the
mind
present
condition
the
best
time
to
ask
a
favour
or
some
beneficial
promise
for
others
is
when
the
person
petitioned
is
in
a
state
of
quiet
happy
good
humour
unaccompanied
by
any
excessive
joyfulness
or
better
still
when
under
the
influence
of
that
keen
but
indefinite
pleasure
which
results
from
a
reverie
of
thought
and
consists
of
a
peaceful
agitation
of
the
spirit
at
such
times
men
are
most
open
to
pity
and
entreaty
and
are
often
glad
to
please
others
and
give
expression
to
the
vague
gratifying
activity
of
their
thoughts
by
some
good
action
he
also
denied
that
an
afflicted
person
ordinarily
receives
more
pity
from
than
from
other
people
for
a
man
companions
in
misfortune
are
always
inclined
to
give
their
own
troubles
precedence
over
his
as
being
more
serious
and
compassionable
and
often
when
a
man
in
recounting
his
sufferings
thinks
he
has
excited
the
sympathy
of
his
auditors
he
is
interrupted
by
one
of
them
who
expatiates
in
turn
on
his
misfortunes
and
ends
by
trying
to
show
that
he
is
the
more
afflicted
of
the
two
he
said
that
in
such
cases
it
generally
happens
as
occurred
to
achilles
when
priam
prostrated
himself
at
his
feet
with
entreaties
and
lamentations
the
tears
of
priam
excited
the
tears
of
achilles
who
began
to
groan
and
weep
like
the
trojan
king
this
he
did
not
from
sympathy
but
because
of
his
own
misfortunes
and
the
thoughts
of
his
dead
father
and
friend
we
compassionate
others
he
said
when
they
suffer
from
evils
we
have
experienced
but
not
so
when
we
and
they
suffer
simultaneously
he
said
that
from
carelessness
and
thoughtlessness
we
do
many
cruel
or
wicked
things
which
very
often
have
the
appearance
of
genuine
cruelty
and
maliciousness
for
example
he
mentioned
the
case
of
a
man
who
spending
his
time
away
from
home
left
his
servants
in
a
dwelling
scarcely
weather
proof
not
designedly
but
simply
from
thoughtlessness
or
disregard
of
their
comfort
he
considered
malice
inhumanity
and
the
like
to
be
far
less
common
among
men
than
mere
thoughtlessness
to
which
he
attributed
very
many
things
called
by
harder
names
he
once
said
that
it
were
better
to
be
completely
ungrateful
towards
a
benefactor
than
to
make
some
trifling
return
for
his
great
kindness
for
in
the
latter
case
the
benefactor
must
consider
the
obligation
as
cancelled
whatever
may
have
been
the
motive
that
inspired
the
donor
and
however
small
the
return
he
is
thus
despoiled
of
the
bare
satisfaction
of
gratitude
on
which
he
probably
reckoned
and
yet
he
can
not
regard
himself
as
treated
ungratefully
though
he
is
so
in
reality
i
have
heard
the
following
saying
attributed
to
him
we
are
inclined
and
accustomed
to
give
our
acquaintances
credit
for
being
able
to
discern
our
true
merits
or
what
we
imagine
them
to
be
and
to
recognise
the
virtue
of
our
words
and
actions
we
also
suppose
that
they
ponder
over
these
virtues
and
merits
of
ours
and
never
let
them
escape
their
memory
but
on
the
other
hand
we
do
not
discern
similar
qualities
in
them
or
else
are
unwilling
to
acknowledge
the
fact
chapter
iv
ottonieri
observed
that
irresolute
men
sometimes
persevere
in
their
undertakings
in
the
face
of
the
greatest
opposition
this
is
even
a
consequence
of
their
irresolution
for
were
they
to
abandon
their
design
it
would
be
evidence
that
they
had
for
once
fulfilled
a
determination
sometimes
they
skilfully
and
speedily
carry
out
a
resolution
to
this
they
are
urged
by
fear
lest
they
should
be
compelled
to
cease
their
task
when
they
would
return
to
the
state
of
perplexity
and
uncertainty
in
which
they
were
formerly
thus
they
strenuously
hasten
the
execution
of
their
design
stimulated
rather
by
anxiety
and
uncertainty
as
to
whether
they
will
conquer
themselves
than
by
the
goal
or
the
difficulties
to
be
overcome
before
it
can
be
reached
at
another
time
he
said
with
a
smile
that
people
accustomed
to
give
expression
to
their
every
thought
and
feeling
in
conversation
with
others
cry
out
when
alone
if
a
fly
bite
them
or
if
they
chance
to
upset
a
glass
of
water
and
on
the
other
hand
they
who
live
solitary
lives
become
so
reserved
that
even
the
presentiment
of
apoplexy
would
not
induce
them
to
speak
in
the
presence
of
others
he
was
of
opinion
that
most
men
reputed
great
in
ancient
and
modern
times
have
obtained
their
reputation
through
a
preponderance
of
one
quality
over
the
rest
in
their
character
and
a
man
possessed
of
the
most
brilliant
but
evenly
proportioned
endowments
would
fail
to
acquire
celebrity
either
with
his
contemporaries
or
posterity
he
divided
the
men
of
civilised
nations
into
three
classes
the
first
class
are
they
whose
individual
nature
and
partly
also
their
natural
human
constitution
become
transformed
under
the
influence
of
the
arts
and
customs
of
urban
life
among
these
he
included
all
men
who
are
skilful
in
business
whether
private
or
public
who
appreciate
society
and
make
themselves
universally
agreeable
to
their
fellows
generally
speaking
such
men
alone
inspire
esteem
and
respect
the
second
class
are
they
who
preserve
their
primitive
nature
in
a
greater
degree
either
from
lack
of
culture
or
because
they
are
naturally
incapable
of
being
influenced
by
the
arts
manners
and
customs
of
others
this
is
the
most
numerous
of
the
three
classes
and
is
held
in
general
contempt
it
embraces
those
who
are
known
as
the
common
people
or
who
deserve
to
be
included
with
them
be
their
station
in
life
what
it
may
the
third
class
incomparably
the
smallest
in
numbers
and
often
even
more
despised
than
the
second
consists
of
those
men
in
whom
nature
is
strong
enough
to
resist
and
often
repulse
the
civilising
influence
of
the
times
they
are
seldom
apt
in
business
or
in
society
nor
do
they
shine
in
conversation
nor
succeed
in
making
themselves
agreeable
to
their
this
class
is
subdivided
into
two
varieties
the
one
includes
those
strong
and
courageous
natures
that
despise
the
contempt
they
excite
and
often
indeed
esteem
it
more
than
honour
they
differ
from
other
men
not
only
by
nature
but
also
by
choice
and
preference
having
nothing
in
common
with
the
hopes
and
pleasures
of
society
solitary
in
a
crowd
they
avoid
other
men
as
much
as
they
themselves
are
avoided
specimens
of
this
class
are
rarely
met
with
the
other
variety
consists
of
persons
whose
nature
is
a
compound
of
strength
weakness
and
timidity
and
who
are
therefore
in
a
constant
state
of
agitation
they
are
as
a
rule
desirous
of
associating
with
their
fellows
and
wishing
to
emulate
the
men
of
the
cultivated
class
they
feel
acutely
the
contempt
in
which
they
are
held
by
their
inferiors
these
men
are
never
successful
in
life
they
fail
in
ever
becoming
practical
and
in
society
are
neither
tolerable
to
themselves
nor
others
not
a
few
of
our
most
gifted
men
of
modern
times
have
belonged
to
this
division
in
more
or
less
degree
rousseau
is
a
famous
example
and
with
him
may
be
bracketed
one
of
the
ancients
virgil
of
the
latter
it
is
said
on
the
authority
of
melissus
that
he
was
very
slow
of
speech
and
apparently
a
most
ordinary
endowed
man
and
this
together
with
the
probability
that
owing
to
his
great
talents
virgil
was
little
at
ease
in
society
seems
likely
enough
both
from
the
laboured
subtlety
of
his
style
and
the
nature
of
his
poetry
it
is
also
confirmed
by
what
we
read
towards
the
end
of
the
second
book
of
the
georgics
there
the
poet
expresses
a
wish
for
a
quiet
and
solitary
life
as
though
he
regarded
it
as
a
remedy
and
refuge
more
than
an
advantage
in
itself
now
seeing
that
with
rare
exceptions
men
of
these
two
species
are
never
esteemed
until
they
are
dead
and
are
of
little
power
in
the
world
he
asserted
as
a
general
rule
that
the
only
way
to
gain
esteem
during
life
is
to
live
unnaturally
and
since
the
first
class
which
is
the
mean
of
the
two
extremes
represents
the
civilisation
of
our
times
he
concluded
from
this
and
other
circumstances
that
the
conduct
of
human
affairs
is
entirely
in
the
hands
of
mediocrity
he
distinguished
also
three
conditions
of
old
age
compared
with
the
other
ages
of
man
when
nature
and
manners
were
first
instituted
men
were
just
and
virtuous
at
all
ages
experience
and
knowledge
of
the
world
did
not
make
men
less
honest
and
upright
old
age
was
then
the
most
venerable
time
of
life
for
besides
having
all
the
good
qualities
common
to
other
men
the
aged
were
naturally
possessed
of
greater
prudence
and
judgment
than
their
juniors
but
in
process
of
time
the
conduct
of
men
changed
their
manners
became
debased
and
corrupt
then
were
the
aged
the
vilest
of
the
vile
for
they
had
served
a
longer
apprenticeship
to
vice
had
been
longer
under
the
influence
of
the
wickedness
of
their
neighbours
and
were
besides
possessed
of
the
spirit
of
cold
indifference
natural
to
their
time
of
life
under
such
conditions
they
were
powerless
to
act
save
by
calumny
fraud
perfidy
cunning
dissimulation
and
other
such
despicable
means
the
corruption
of
men
at
length
exceeded
all
bounds
they
despised
virtue
and
before
they
knew
anything
of
the
world
and
its
sad
truth
in
their
youth
they
drained
the
cup
of
evil
and
dissipation
old
age
was
then
not
indeed
venerable
for
few
things
could
be
so
called
but
the
most
bearable
time
of
life
eor
whereas
the
mental
ardour
and
bodily
strength
which
formerly
stimulated
the
imagination
and
the
conception
of
noble
thoughts
had
often
given
rise
to
virtuous
habits
sentiments
and
actions
the
same
causes
latterly
increased
man
wickedness
by
enlarging
his
capacity
for
evil
to
which
it
lent
an
additional
attractiveness
but
this
ardour
diminished
with
age
bodily
decrepitude
and
the
coldness
incident
to
age
things
ordinarily
more
dangerous
to
virtue
than
vice
in
addition
to
this
excessive
knowledge
of
the
world
became
so
dissatisfactory
and
wearisome
a
thing
that
instead
of
conducting
men
from
good
to
evil
as
formerly
it
gave
them
strength
to
resist
wickedness
and
sometimes
even
to
hate
it
so
that
comparing
old
age
with
the
other
periods
of
life
it
may
be
said
to
have
been
as
better
to
good
in
the
earliest
times
as
worse
to
bad
in
the
corrupt
times
and
subsequently
as
bad
to
worse
chapter
ottonieri
often
talked
of
the
quality
of
nowadays
called
egotism
i
will
narrate
some
of
his
remarks
on
this
subject
he
said
that
if
you
hear
a
person
speak
well
or
ill
of
another
with
whom
he
has
had
dealings
and
term
him
honest
or
the
contrary
value
his
opinion
not
a
whit
he
speaks
well
or
ill
of
the
man
simply
as
his
relationship
with
him
has
proved
satisfactory
or
the
reverse
he
said
that
no
one
can
love
without
a
rival
being
asked
to
explain
he
replied
because
the
person
beloved
is
a
very
close
rival
of
the
lover
suppose
a
case
he
said
in
which
you
asked
a
favour
from
a
friend
who
could
not
grant
it
without
incurring
the
hatred
of
a
third
person
suppose
too
that
the
three
interested
people
are
in
the
same
condition
of
life
i
affirm
that
your
request
would
have
little
chance
of
success
even
though
your
gratitude
to
the
granter
might
exceed
the
hatred
he
would
incur
from
the
other
person
the
reason
of
this
is
as
follows
we
fear
men
anger
and
hatred
more
than
we
value
their
love
and
gratitude
and
rightly
so
for
do
we
not
oftener
see
the
former
productive
of
results
than
the
latter
besides
hatred
or
vengeance
is
a
personal
satisfaction
whereas
gratitude
is
merely
a
service
pleasing
to
the
recipient
he
said
that
respect
and
services
rendered
to
others
in
expectation
of
some
profitable
return
are
rarely
successful
because
men
especially
nowadays
when
they
are
more
knowing
than
formerly
are
less
inclined
to
give
than
receive
nevertheless
such
services
as
the
young
render
to
the
old
who
are
rich
or
powerful
attain
their
end
more
often
than
not
the
following
remarks
about
modern
customs
i
remember
hearing
from
his
own
mouth
nothing
makes
a
man
of
the
world
so
ashamed
as
the
feeling
that
he
is
ashamed
if
by
chance
he
ever
realises
it
marvellous
is
the
power
of
fashion
for
we
see
nations
and
men
so
conservative
in
everything
else
and
so
careful
of
tradition
act
blindly
in
this
respect
often
indeed
unreasonably
and
against
their
own
interests
fashion
is
despotic
she
constrains
men
to
lay
aside
change
or
assume
manners
customs
and
ideas
just
when
she
pleases
even
though
the
things
changed
be
rational
useful
or
beautiful
and
the
substitutes
the
contrary
there
are
an
infinite
number
of
things
in
public
and
private
life
which
though
truly
ridiculous
seldom
excite
laughter
if
by
chance
a
man
does
laugh
in
such
a
case
he
laughs
alone
and
is
soon
silent
on
the
other
hand
we
laugh
daily
at
a
thousand
very
serious
and
natural
things
and
such
laughter
is
quickly
contagious
thus
most
things
which
excite
laughter
are
in
reality
anything
but
ridiculous
and
we
often
laugh
simply
because
there
is
nothing
to
laugh
at
or
nothing
worthy
of
laughter
we
frequently
hear
and
say
such
things
as
good
ancients
good
ancestors
again
man
worthy
of
the
ancients
by
which
we
mean
a
trustworthy
and
honest
man
every
generation
believes
on
the
one
hand
that
its
ancestors
were
better
than
its
contemporaries
and
on
the
other
hand
that
the
human
race
progresses
as
it
leaves
the
primitive
state
to
return
to
which
would
be
a
movement
for
the
worse
further
and
further
behind
wonderful
contradiction
the
true
is
not
necessarily
the
beautiful
yet
though
beauty
be
preferable
to
truth
where
the
former
is
wanting
the
latter
is
the
next
best
thing
now
in
large
towns
the
beautiful
is
not
to
be
found
because
it
no
longer
has
a
place
in
the
excitement
of
human
life
the
true
is
equally
for
all
things
there
are
false
or
frivolous
consequently
in
large
towns
one
sees
feels
hears
and
breathes
nothing
but
falsity
which
in
time
custom
renders
even
pleasurable
to
sensitive
minds
what
misery
can
exceed
this
people
who
need
not
work
for
their
bread
and
who
accordingly
leave
the
care
of
it
to
others
have
usually
great
difficulty
in
providing
themselves
with
one
of
the
chief
necessities
of
life
occupation
this
may
indeed
be
called
the
greatest
necessity
of
life
for
it
includes
all
others
it
is
greater
even
than
the
necessity
of
living
for
life
itself
apart
from
happiness
is
not
a
good
thing
and
possessing
life
as
we
do
our
one
endeavour
should
be
to
endure
as
little
unhappiness
as
possible
now
on
the
one
hand
an
idle
and
empty
life
is
very
unhappy
and
on
the
other
hand
the
best
way
to
pass
our
time
is
to
spend
it
in
providing
for
our
wants
he
said
that
the
custom
of
buying
and
selling
human
beings
has
proved
useful
to
the
race
in
confirmation
of
this
he
mentioned
the
practice
of
inoculating
for
which
originated
in
circassia
from
constantinople
it
passed
to
england
and
thence
became
disseminated
throughout
europe
its
office
was
to
mitigate
the
destructiveness
wrought
by
true
which
besides
endangering
the
life
and
comeliness
of
the
circassian
children
and
youths
was
especially
disastrous
in
its
effects
on
the
sale
of
their
maidens
he
narrated
of
himself
that
on
leaving
school
to
enter
the
world
of
life
he
mentally
resolved
inexperienced
and
devoted
to
truth
as
he
was
to
praise
no
person
or
thing
that
did
not
seem
really
deserving
of
praise
he
kept
his
determination
for
a
whole
year
during
which
time
he
did
not
utter
a
single
word
of
praise
then
he
broke
his
vow
fearing
lest
from
want
of
practice
he
should
forget
all
the
eulogistic
phraseology
he
had
learnt
shortly
before
at
the
school
of
rhetoric
from
that
time
he
absolutely
renounced
his

ottonieri
was
accustomed
to
read
out
passages
from
books
taken
at
hazard
especially
those
of
ancient
writers
he
would
often
interrupt
himself
by
uttering
some
remark
or
comment
on
this
or
that
passage
one
day
he
read
from
laertius
lives
of
the
philosophers
the
passage
where
chilo
being
asked
how
the
learned
differed
from
the
ignorant
is
said
to
have
replied
that
the
former
possess
ottonieri
said
now
all
is
changed
the
ignorant
hope
but
the
learned
do
not
again
as
he
read
in
the
same
book
how
socrates
affirmed
that
the
world
contains
but
one
benefit
knowledge
and
but
one
evil
ignorance
he
said
i
know
nothing
about
the
knowledge
and
ignorance
of
the
ancients
but
in
the
present
day
i
should
reverse
this
saying
commenting
on
this
maxim
of
hegesias
also
from
the
book
of
laertius
the
wise
man
attends
to
his
own
interests
in
everything
he
said
if
all
men
who
carry
out
this
principle
be
philosophers
plato
may
come
and
establish
his
republic
throughout
the
civilised
world
he
greatly
praised
the
following
saying
of
bion
borysthenes
mentioned
by
laertius
they
who
seek
the
greatest
happiness
suffer
most
to
this
he
added
and
they
on
the
other
hand
are
happiest
who
are
contented
with
least
and
who
are
accustomed
to
enjoy
their
happiness
over
again
in
memory
from
plutarch
he
read
how
stratocles
excited
the
anger
of
the
athenians
by
inducing
them
on
a
certain
occasion
to
sacrifice
as
though
they
were
victors
and
how
he
then
replied
by
demanding
why
they
blamed
him
that
he
had
made
them
happy
and
joyful
for
the
space
of
three
days
ottonieri
added
nature
might
make
the
same
response
to
those
who
complain
that
she
endeavours
to
conceal
the
truth
beneath
a
multitude
of
vain
but
beautiful
and
pleasing
appearances
how
have
i
injured
you
in
making
you
happy
for
three
or
four
days
on
another
occasion
he
remarked
that
tasso
saying
about
a
child
induced
to
take
his
medicine
under
a
false
belief
he
is
nourished
on
deception
is
equally
applicable
to
all
our
race
in
relation
to
the
errors
in
which
man
puts
faith
beading
the
following
from
cicero
paradoxes
do
pleasures
make
a
person
better
or
more
estimable
is
there
any
one
who
boasts
of
the
pleasures
he
enjoys
he
said
beloved
cicero
i
can
not
say
that
pleasures
make
men
in
the
present
day
either
more
estimable
or
better
but
undoubtedly
they
cause
them
to
be
more
esteemed
for
in
the
present
day
most
young
men
seek
esteem
by
no
other
way
than
pleasure
and
not
only
do
they
boast
of
these
pleasures
when
they
obtain
them
but
they
din
the
intelligence
of
their
enjoyment
into
the
ears
of
friends
and
strangers
willing
or
unwilling
there
are
also
many
pleasures
which
are
eagerly
desired
and
sought
after
not
as
pleasures
but
for
the
sake
of
the
renown
reputation
and
that
they
bring
and
very
often
these
latter
things
are
appropriated
when
the
pleasures
have
neither
been
obtained
nor
sought
or
else
have
been
entirely
imaginary
he
noted
from
arrian
history
of
the
wars
of
alexander
the
great
that
at
the
battle
of
issus
darius
placed
his
greek
mercenaries
in
the
van
of
his
army
and
alexander
his
greeks
at
the
wings
he
thought
that
this
fact
alone
was
sufficient
to
determine
the
result
of
the
battle
he
never
blamed
authors
for
writing
much
about
themselves
on
the
contrary
he
applauded
them
for
so
doing
and
said
that
on
such
occasions
they
are
nearly
always
eloquent
and
their
style
though
perhaps
unusual
and
even
singular
is
ordinarily
good
and
fluent
and
this
is
not
surprising
for
writers
treating
of
themselves
have
their
heart
and
soul
in
the
work
they
are
at
no
loss
what
to
say
their
subject
and
the
interest
they
take
in
it
are
jointly
productive
of
original
thought
they
confine
themselves
to
themselves
and
do
not
drink
at
strange
fountains
nor
need
they
be
commonplace
and
trite
there
is
nothing
to
induce
them
to
garnish
their
writing
with
artificial
ornamentation
or
to
affect
an
unnatural
style
and
it
is
an
egregious
error
to
suppose
that
readers
are
ordinarily
little
interested
in
a
writer
confessions
for
in
the
first
place
whenever
a
man
relates
his
own
experiences
and
thoughts
simply
and
pleasingly
he
succeeds
in
commanding
attention
secondly
because
in
no
way
can
we
discuss
and
represent
the
affairs
of
others
more
truthfully
and
effectively
than
by
treating
of
our
own
affairs
seeing
that
all
men
have
something
in
common
either
naturally
or
by
force
of
circumstances
and
that
we
are
better
able
to
illustrate
human
nature
in
ourselves
than
in
others
in
confirmation
of
these
opinions
he
instanced
demosthenes
oration
for
the
crown
in
which
the
speaker
continually
referring
to
himself
is
surpassingly
eloquent
and
cicero
when
he
touches
on
his
own
affairs
is
equally
successful
peculiarly
so
in
his
oration
for
milo
admirable
throughout
but
above
all
praise
towards
the
end
where
he
himself
is
introduced
bossuet
also
is
supremely
excellent
in
his
panegyric
of
the
prince
de
condé
where
he
mentions
his
own
extreme
age
and
approaching
death
again
the
emperor
julian
whose
writings
are
all
else
trifling
and
often
unbearable
is
at
his
best
in
the
misopogony
speech
against
the
beard
in
which
he
replies
to
the
ridicule
and
malice
of
the
people
of
antioch
he
is
here
scarcely
inferior
to
lucian
in
wit
vigour
and
acuteness
whereas
his
work
on
the
cæsars
professedly
an
imitation
of
lucian
is
pointless
dull
feeble
and
almost
stupid
in
italian
literature
which
is
almost
devoid
of
eloquent
writings
the
apology
of
lorenzo
de
medici
is
a
specimen
of
eloquence
grand
and
perfect
in
every
way
tasso
also
is
often
eloquent
where
he
speaks
much
of
himself
and
is
nearly
always
excessively
so
in
his
letters
which
are
almost
occupied
with
his
own
affairs
chapter
vii
many
other
famous
sayings
of
ottonieri
are
recorded
amongst
them
is
a
reply
he
gave
to
a
clever
young
man
who
knew
little
of
the
world
this
youth
said
that
he
learned
daily
one
hundred
pages
of
the
art
of
in
society
but
remarked
ottonieri
the
book
has
five
million
pages
another
youth
whose
thoughtless
and
impetuous
behaviour
constantly
got
him
into
trouble
used
to
excuse
himself
by
saying
that
life
is
a
comedy
may
be
replied
ottonieri
but
even
then
it
is
better
for
the
actor
to
gain
applause
than
rebuke
often
too
the
or
clumsy
comedian
ends
by
dying
of
starvation
one
day
he
saw
a
murderer
who
was
lame
and
could
not
therefore
escape
being
carried
off
by
the
police
see
friends
he
said
justice
lame
though
she
be
can
bring
the
doer
of
evil
to
account
if
he
also
be
lame
during
a
journey
through
italy
he
met
a
courtier
who
desirous
of
acting
the
critic
to
ottonieri
began
i
will
speak
candidly
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
listen
attentively
said
the
other
for
as
a
traveller
i
appreciate
uncommon
things
being
in
need
of
money
he
once
asked
a
loan
from
a
certain
man
who
excusing
himself
on
the
plea
of
poverty
added
that
were
he
rich
the
necessities
of
his
friends
would
be
his
first
thought
i
should
be
truly
sorry
were
you
to
bestow
on
us
such
a
valuable
moment
replied
ottonieri
god
grant
you
may
never
become
rich
when
young
he
wrote
some
verses
using
certain
obsolete
expressions
at
the
request
of
an
old
lady
he
recited
them
to
her
she
professed
ignorance
of
their
meaning
and
said
that
in
her
day
such
words
were
not
in
use
ottonieri
replied
i
thought
they
might
have
been
simply
because
they
are
very
ancient
of
a
certain
very
rich
miser
who
had
been
robbed
of
a
little
money
he
said
this
man
behaved
in
a
miserly
manner
even
to
thieves
he
said
of
a
man
who
had
a
mania
for
calculating
on
every
possible
occasion
other
men
make
things
this
fellow
counts
them
being
asked
his
opinion
about
a
certain
old
figure
of
jove
over
which
some
antiquaries
were
disputing
he
said
do
you
not
see
that
it
is
a
cretan
jove
of
a
foolish
fellow
who
imagined
himself
to
be
an
admirable
reasoner
yet
was
illogical
whenever
he
spoke
two
words
he
said
this
person
exemplifies
the
greek
definition
of
man
as
a
animal
when
on
his
deathbed
he
composed
this
epitaph
which
was
subsequently
engraved
on
his
tomb
here
lie
the
bones
of
philip
ottonieri
born
for
virtue
and
glory
he
lived
idle
and
useless
and
died
in
obscurity
not
without
a
knowledge
of
nature
and
his
own
destiny
between
christopher
columbus
and
pietro
a
fine
night
friend
fine
indeed
but
a
sight
of
land
would
be
much
finer
decidedly
so
even
you
are
tired
of
a
life
at
sea
not
so
but
i
am
rather
weary
of
this
voyage
which
turns
out
to
be
so
much
longer
than
i
expected
do
not
however
think
that
i
blame
you
like
the
others
rather
consider
that
i
will
as
hitherto
do
all
i
can
to
help
you
in
anything
relating
to
the
voyage
but
just
for
the
sake
of
some
talk
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
candidly
and
explicitly
whether
you
are
as
confident
as
at
first
about
finding
land
in
this
part
of
the
world
or
if
after
spending
so
much
time
to
no
purpose
you
begin
at
all
to
doubt
speaking
frankly
as
to
a
friend
who
will
not
betray
me
i
confess
i
am
a
little
dubious
especially
because
certain
evidences
during
the
voyage
which
filled
me
with
hope
have
turned
out
deceitful
for
instance
the
birds
which
dew
over
us
from
the
west
soon
after
we
left
gomera
and
which
i
considered
a
sure
sign
of
land
not
far
distant
similarly
more
than
one
conjecture
and
anticipation
made
before
setting
out
regarding
different
things
that
were
to
have
taken
place
during
the
voyage
have
failed
of
realisation
so
that
at
length
i
can
not
but
say
to
myself
since
these
predictions
in
which
i
put
the
utmost
faith
have
not
been
verified
why
may
not
also
my
chief
conjecture
that
of
finding
land
beyond
the
ocean
be
also
unfounded
it
is
true
this
belief
of
mine
is
so
logical
that
if
it
be
false
on
the
one
hand
it
would
seem
as
if
no
human
judgment
could
be
reliable
except
such
as
concern
things
actually
seen
and
touched
and
on
the
other
hand
i
remember
how
seldom
reality
agrees
with
expectation
i
ask
myself
what
ground
have
you
for
believing
that
both
hemispheres
resemble
each
other
so
that
the
western
like
the
eastern
is
part
land
and
part
water
why
may
it
not
be
one
immense
sea
or
instead
of
land
and
water
may
it
not
contain
some
other
element
and
supposing
it
to
have
land
and
water
like
the
other
why
may
it
not
be
uninhabited
or
even
uninhabitable
if
it
be
peopled
as
numerously
as
our
hemisphere
what
proof
have
you
that
rational
beings
are
to
be
found
there
as
in
ours
and
if
so
why
not
some
other
intelligent
animals
instead
of
men
supposing
they
be
men
why
not
of
a
kind
very
different
from
those
you
are
acquainted
with
for
instance
with
much
larger
bodies
stronger
more
skilful
naturally
gifted
with
much
more
genius
and
intelligence
more
civilised
and
richer
in
sciences
and
arts
these
thoughts
occur
to
me
and
in
truth
we
see
nature
endowed
with
such
power
so
diverse
and
manifold
in
her
effects
that
we
not
only
are
unable
to
form
a
certain
opinion
about
her
works
in
distant
and
unknown
parts
of
the
world
but
we
may
even
doubt
whether
we
do
not
deceive
ourselves
in
drawing
conclusions
from
the
known
world
and
applying
them
to
the
unknown
nor
would
it
be
contrary
to
probability
to
imagine
that
the
things
of
the
unknown
world
in
whole
or
part
were
strange
and
extraordinary
to
us
for
do
we
not
see
with
our
own
eyes
that
the
needle
in
these
seas
falls
away
from
the
pole
star
not
a
little
towards
the
west
such
a
thing
is
perfectly
novel
and
hitherto
unheard
of
by
all
navigators
and
even
after
much
thought
i
can
arrive
at
no
satisfactory
explanation
of
it
i
do
not
infer
that
the
fables
of
the
ancients
regarding
the
wonders
of
the
undiscovered
world
and
this
ocean
are
at
all
credible
annonus
for
instance
said
of
these
parts
that
the
nights
were
illumined
by
flames
and
the
glow
of
fiery
torrents
which
emptied
themselves
into
the
sea
we
observe
also
how
foolish
hitherto
have
been
all
the
fears
of
miraculous
and
terrible
novelties
felt
by
our
during
the
voyage
as
when
on
coming
to
that
stretch
of
seaweed
which
made
as
it
were
a
meadow
in
the
sea
and
impeded
us
so
greatly
they
imagined
we
had
reached
the
verge
of
navigable
waters
i
say
this
simply
because
i
wish
you
to
see
that
although
this
idea
of
mine
about
undiscovered
land
may
be
founded
on
very
reasonable
suppositions
in
which
many
excellent
geographers
astronomers
and
navigators
with
whom
i
conversed
on
the
subject
in
spain
italy
and
portugal
agree
with
me
it
might
yet
be
fallacious
in
short
we
often
see
many
admirably
drawn
conclusions
prove
erroneous
especially
in
matters
about
which
we
have
very
little
knowledge
so
that
in
fact
you
have
risked
your
own
life
and
the
lives
of
your
companions
on
behalf
of
a
mere
possibility
i
can
not
deny
it
but
apart
from
the
fact
that
men
daily
endanger
their
lives
for
much
frailer
reasons
and
far
more
trifling
things
or
even
without
thinking
at
all
pray
consider
a
moment
if
you
and
i
and
all
of
us
were
not
now
here
in
this
ship
in
the
middle
of
this
ocean
in
this
strange
solitude
uncertain
and
hazardous
though
it
be
what
should
we
be
doing
how
should
we
be
occupied
how
should
we
be
spending
our
time
more
joyfully
perhaps
more
probably
in
greater
trouble
and
difficulty
or
worse
in
a
state
of
ennui
for
what
is
implied
in
a
state
of
life
free
from
uncertainty
and
danger
if
contentment
and
happiness
it
is
preferable
to
all
others
if
weariness
and
misery
i
know
nothing
so
undesirable
i
do
not
wish
to
mention
the
glory
and
useful
intelligence
that
we
shall
take
back
with
us
if
our
enterprise
succeed
as
we
hope
if
the
voyage
be
of
no
other
use
to
us
it
is
very
advantageous
inasmuch
as
it
for
a
time
frees
us
from
ennui
endears
life
to
us
and
enhances
the
value
of
many
things
that
we
should
not
otherwise
esteem
you
remember
perhaps
what
the
ancients
say
about
unfortunate
lovers
these
used
to
throw
themselves
from
the
rock
of
maur
then
called
leucadia
into
the
sea
being
rescued
therefrom
they
found
themselves
thanks
to
apollo
delivered
from
their
love
passion
whether
or
not
this
be
credible
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
lovers
having
escaped
their
danger
for
a
short
time
even
without
apollo
assistance
loved
the
life
they
previously
hated
or
loved
and
valued
it
increasedly
every
voyage
is
in
my
opinion
comparable
to
the
leap
from
the
leucadian
rock
producing
the
same
useful
results
though
these
are
of
a
more
durable
kind
it
is
ordinarily
believed
that
sailors
and
soldiers
because
incessantly
in
danger
of
their
lives
value
existence
more
lightly
than
other
people
eor
the
same
reason
i
come
to
a
contrary
conclusion
and
imagine
few
persons
hold
life
in
such
high
estimation
as
soldiers
and
sailors
just
as
we
care
nothing
for
many
benefits
as
soon
as
we
possess
them
so
sailors
cherish
and
value
very
greatly
numerous
things
that
are
far
from
being
good
simply
because
they
are
deprived
of
them
who
would
think
of
including
a
little
earth
in
the
catalogue
of
human
benefits
none
but
navigators
and
especially
such
as
ourselves
who
owing
to
the
uncertain
nature
of
our
voyage
desire
nothing
so
much
as
the
sight
of
a
tiny
piece
of
land
this
is
our
first
thought
on
awaking
and
our
last
before
we
fall
asleep
and
if
at
some
future
time
we
chance
to
see
in
the
distance
the
peak
of
a
mountain
the
tops
of
a
forest
or
some
such
evidence
of
land
we
shall
scarcely
be
able
to
contain
ourselves
for
joy
once
on
the
mere
consciousness
of
being
free
to
go
where
we
please
will
suffice
to
make
us
happy
for
several
days
that
is
all
very
true
and
if
your
conjecture
only
prove
to
be
as
reasonable
as
your
justification
of
it
we
shall
not
fail
to
enjoy
this
happiness
sooner
or
later
personally
i
think
we
shall
soon
do
so
though
i
dare
not
actually
promise
such
a
thing
you
know
we
have
for
several
days
been
able
to
fathom
and
the
quality
of
the
matter
brought
up
by
the
lead
seems
to
me
auspicious
the
clouds
about
the
sun
towards
evening
are
of
a
different
form
and
colour
to
what
they
were
a
few
days
ago
the
atmosphere
as
you
can
feel
is
warmer
and
softer
than
it
was
the
wind
no
longer
blows
with
the
same
force
nor
in
so
straightforward
and
unwavering
a
manner
it
is
inclined
to
be
hesitating
and
changeable
as
though
broken
by
some
impediment
to
these
signs
add
that
of
the
piece
of
cane
we
discovered
floating
in
the
sea
which
bore
marks
of
having
been
recently
severed
and
the
little
branch
of
a
tree
with
fresh
red
berries
on
it
besides
the
swarms
of
birds
that
pass
over
us
though
they
have
deceived
me
before
are
now
so
frequent
and
immense
that
i
think
there
must
be
some
special
reason
for
their
appearance
particularly
because
we
see
amongst
them
some
which
do
not
resemble
sea
birds
in
short
all
these
omens
together
make
me
very
hopeful
and
expectant
however
diffident
i
may
pretend
to
be
god
grant
your
surmises
may
be
true
of
amelio
a
lonely
philosopher
was
seated
reading
one
spring
morning
in
the
shade
of
his
country
house
being
distracted
by
the
songs
of
the
birds
in
the
fields
he
gradually
resigned
himself
to
listening
and
thinking
at
length
he
threw
his
book
aside
and
taking
up
a
pen
wrote
as
follows
birds
are
naturally
the
most
joyful
creatures
in
the
world
i
do
not
say
this
because
of
the
cheerful
influence
they
always
exercise
over
us
i
mean
that
they
themselves
are
more
and
joyful
than
any
other
animal
for
we
see
other
animals
ordinarily
stolid
and
grave
and
many
even
seem
melancholy
they
rarely
give
signs
of
joy
and
when
they
do
these
are
but
slight
and
of
brief
duration
in
most
of
their
enjoyments
and
pleasures
they
do
not
express
any
gratification
the
green
fields
extensive
and
charming
landscapes
noble
planets
pure
and
sweet
atmosphere
if
even
a
cause
of
pleasure
to
them
do
not
excite
in
them
any
joyful
demonstrations
save
that
on
the
authority
of
zenophon
hares
are
said
to
skip
and
frolic
with
delight
when
the
moon
radiance
is
at
its
brightest
birds
on
the
other
hand
show
extreme
joy
both
in
motion
and
appearance
and
it
is
the
sight
of
this
evident
disposition
for
enjoyment
on
their
part
that
gladdens
us
as
we
watch
them
and
this
appearance
must
not
be
regarded
as
unreal
and
deceptive
they
sing
to
express
the
happiness
they
feel
and
the
happier
they
are
the
more
vigorously
do
they
sing
and
if
as
it
is
said
they
sing
louder
and
more
sweetly
when
in
love
than
at
other
times
it
is
equally
certain
that
other
pleasures
besides
love
incite
them
to
sing
for
we
may
notice
they
warble
more
on
a
quiet
and
peaceful
day
than
when
the
day
is
dark
and
uncertain
and
in
stormy
weather
or
when
frightened
they
are
silent
but
the
storm
passed
they
reappear
singing
and
frolicking
with
one
another
again
they
sing
in
the
morning
when
they
awake
being
partly
incited
to
this
by
a
feeling
of
joy
for
the
new
day
and
partly
by
the
pleasure
generally
felt
by
every
animal
when
refreshed
and
restored
by
sleep
they
also
delight
in
gay
foliage
rich
valleys
pure
and
sparkling
water
and
beautiful
country
it
is
said
that
birds
voices
are
softer
and
sweeter
and
their
songs
more
refined
with
us
than
among
wild
and
uncivilised
people
this
being
so
it
would
seem
that
birds
are
subject
to
the
influence
of
the
civilisation
with
which
they
associate
whether
or
not
this
be
true
it
is
a
remarkable
instance
of
the
providence
of
nature
that
they
should
have
capacity
for
flight
as
well
as
the
gift
of
song
so
that
their
voices
might
from
a
lofty
situation
reach
a
greater
number
of
auditors
it
is
also
providential
that
the
air
which
is
the
natural
element
of
sound
should
be
inhabited
by
vocal
and
musical
creatures
truly
the
singing
of
birds
is
a
great
solace
and
pleasure
to
us
and
all
other
animals
this
fact
is
not
i
believe
so
much
due
to
the
sweetness
of
the
sounds
nor
to
their
variety
and
harmony
as
to
the
joyful
signification
of
songs
generally
and
those
of
birds
in
particular
birds
laugh
as
it
were
to
show
their
contentment
and
happiness
it
may
therefore
be
said
that
they
partake
in
a
degree
of
man
privilege
of
laughter
unpossessed
by
other
animals
now
some
people
think
that
man
may
as
well
be
termed
a
laughing
animal
as
an
animal
possessed
of
mind
and
reason
for
laughter
seems
to
them
quite
as
much
peculiar
to
man
as
reason
and
it
is
certainly
wonderful
that
man
the
most
wretched
and
miserable
of
all
creatures
should
have
the
faculty
of
laughter
which
is
wanting
in
other
animals
marvellous
also
is
the
use
we
make
of
this
faculty
we
see
people
suffering
from
some
terrible
calamity
or
mental
distress
others
who
have
lost
all
love
of
life
and
regard
every
human
thing
as
full
of
vanity
who
are
almost
incapable
of
joy
and
deprived
of
hope
laugh
nevertheless
indeed
the
more
such
men
realise
the
vanity
of
hope
and
the
misery
of
life
the
fewer
their
expectations
and
pleasures
so
much
the
more
do
they
feel
inclined
to
laugh
now
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
explain
or
analyse
the
nature
of
laughter
in
general
and
its
connection
with
the
human
mind
perhaps
it
may
aptly
be
termed
a
species
of
momentary
folly
or
delirium
for
men
can
have
no
reasonable
and
just
cause
for
laughter
because
nothing
really
satisfies
nor
truly
pleases
them
it
would
be
curious
to
discover
and
trace
out
the
history
of
this
faculty
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
man
primitive
and
wild
state
it
was
expressed
by
a
peculiar
gravity
of
countenance
as
in
other
animals
who
show
it
even
to
the
extent
of
melancholy
for
this
reason
i
imagine
that
laughter
not
only
came
into
the
world
after
tears
which
can
not
be
questioned
but
that
a
long
time
passed
before
it
appeared
during
that
time
neither
the
mother
greeted
her
child
with
a
smile
nor
did
the
child
smilingly
recognise
her
as
virgil
says
and
the
reason
why
in
the
present
day
among
civilised
people
children
smile
as
soon
as
they
are
born
is
explainable
by
virtue
of
example
they
see
others
smile
therefore
they
also
smile
it
is
probable
that
laughter
originated
in
drunkenness
another
peculiarity
of
the
human
race
this
vice
is
far
from
being
confined
to
civilised
nations
for
we
know
that
scarcely
any
people
can
be
found
that
do
not
possess
an
intoxicating
liquor
of
some
kind
which
they
indulge
in
to
excess
and
this
can
not
be
wondered
at
when
we
remember
that
men
the
most
unhappy
of
all
animals
are
above
all
pleased
with
anything
that
easily
alienates
their
minds
such
as
or
a
suspension
of
their
usual
life
from
which
interruption
and
temporary
diminution
of
the
sense
and
knowledge
of
their
peculiar
evils
they
receive
no
slight
benefit
and
whereas
savages
have
ordinarily
a
sad
and
grave
countenance
yet
when
in
a
state
of
drunkenness
they
laugh
immoderately
and
talk
and
sing
incessantly
contrary
to
their
custom
but
i
will
discuss
this
matter
more
in
detail
in
a
history
of
laughter
which
i
think
of
composing
having
discovered
its
origin
i
will
trace
its
history
and
fortune
to
the
present
day
when
it
is
more
valued
than
at
any
previous
time
it
occupies
among
civilised
nations
a
place
and
fills
an
office
somewhat
similar
to
the
parts
formerly
played
by
virtue
justice
honour
and
the
like
often
indeed
frightening
and
deterring
men
from
the
committal
of
evil
but
to
return
to
the
birds
from
the
effect
their
singing
produces
in
me
i
conclude
that
the
sight
and
recognition
of
joy
in
others
of
which
we
are
not
envious
gratifies
and
rejoices
us
we
may
therefore
be
grateful
to
nature
for
having
ordained
that
the
songs
of
birds
which
are
a
demonstration
of
joy
and
a
species
of
laughter
should
be
in
public
differing
from
the
private
nature
of
the
singing
and
laughter
of
men
who
represent
the
rest
of
the
world
and
it
is
wisely
decreed
that
the
earth
and
air
should
be
enlivened
by
creatures
that
seem
to
applaud
universal
life
with
the
joyful
harmony
of
their
sweet
voices
and
thus
incite
other
living
beings
to
joy
by
their
continual
though
false
testimony
to
the
happiness
of
things
it
is
reasonable
that
birds
should
be
and
show
themselves
more
joyful
than
other
creatures
tor
as
i
have
said
they
are
naturally
better
adapted
for
joy
and
happiness
in
the
first
place
apparently
they
are
not
subject
to
ennui
they
change
their
position
momentarily
and
pass
from
country
to
country
however
distant
and
from
the
lowest
regions
of
the
air
to
the
highest
quickly
and
with
wonderful
ease
life
to
them
is
made
up
of
an
infinite
variety
of
sights
and
experiences
their
bodies
are
in
a
continuous
state
of
activity
and
they
themselves
are
full
of
vital
power
all
other
animals
their
wants
being
satisfied
love
quietude
and
laziness
none
except
fishes
and
certain
flying
insects
keep
long
in
motion
simply
for
amusement
the
savage
for
instance
except
to
supply
his
daily
wants
which
demand
little
and
brief
exertion
or
when
unable
to
hunt
scarcely
stirs
a
step
he
loves
idleness
and
tranquillity
above
everything
and
passes
nearly
the
whole
day
sitting
in
silence
and
indolence
within
his
rude
cabin
or
at
its
opening
or
in
some
rocky
cave
or
place
of
shelter
birds
on
the
contrary
very
rarely
stay
long
in
one
place
they
fly
backwards
and
forwards
without
any
necessity
simply
as
a
pastime
and
often
having
gone
several
hundred
miles
away
from
the
country
they
usually
frequent
they
return
thither
the
same
evening
and
even
for
the
short
time
they
are
in
one
place
their
bodies
are
never
still
ever
turning
here
and
there
they
are
always
either
flocking
together
pecking
or
shaking
themselves
or
hopping
about
in
their
extraordinarily
vivacious
and
active
maimer
in
short
from
the
time
a
bird
bursts
its
shell
until
it
dies
save
intervals
of
sleep
it
is
never
still
for
a
moment
from
these
considerations
it
may
reasonably
be
affirmed
that
whereas
the
normal
state
of
animals
including
even
man
is
quietude
that
of
birds
is
motion
we
find
also
that
birds
are
so
endowed
that
their
natural
qualities
harmonise
with
the
exterior
qualities
and
conditions
of
their
life
this
again
makes
them
better
adapted
for
happiness
than
other
animals
they
have
remarkably
acute
powers
of
hearing
and
a
faculty
of
vision
almost
inconceivably
perfect
owing
to
this
last
they
can
discern
simultaneously
a
vast
extent
of
country
and
are
daily
charmed
by
spectacles
the
most
immense
and
varied
from
these
things
it
may
be
inferred
that
birds
ought
to
possess
an
imagination
vivid
and
powerful
in
the
highest
degree
not
the
ardent
and
stormy
imagination
of
dante
or
tasso
for
this
is
a
disastrous
endowment
and
the
cause
of
endless
anxieties
and
sufferings
but
a
fertile
light
and
childish
fancy
such
as
is
productive
of
joyful
thoughts
sweet
unrealities
and
manifold
pleasures
this
is
the
noblest
gift
of
nature
to
living
creatures
and
birds
have
this
faculty
in
a
great
measure
for
their
own
delight
and
benefit
without
experiencing
any
of
its
hurtful
and
painful
consequences
for
their
prolific
imagination
as
with
children
combines
with
their
bodily
vigour
to
render
them
happy
and
contented
instead
of
being
injurious
and
productive
of
misery
as
with
most
men
thus
birds
may
be
said
to
resemble
children
equally
in
their
vivacity
and
restlessness
and
the
other
attributes
of
their
nature
if
the
advantages
of
childhood
were
common
to
other
ages
and
its
evils
not
exceeded
later
in
life
man
might
perhaps
be
better
able
to
bear
patiently
the
burden
of
existence
to
me
it
seems
that
the
nature
of
birds
considered
aright
is
manifestly
more
perfect
than
that
of
other
animals
for
in
the
first
place
birds
are
superior
to
other
animals
in
sight
and
hearing
which
are
the
principal
senses
of
life
in
the
second
place
birds
naturally
prefer
motion
to
rest
whereas
other
creatures
have
the
contrary
preference
and
since
activity
is
a
more
living
thing
than
repose
birds
may
be
said
to
have
more
life
than
other
animals
it
follows
therefore
that
birds
are
physically
and
in
the
exercise
of
their
faculties
superior
to
other
creatures
now
if
life
be
better
than
its
contrary
the
fuller
and
more
perfect
the
life
as
with
birds
the
greater
is
the
superiority
of
creatures
possessing
it
over
less
endowed
animals
we
must
not
forget
also
that
birds
are
adapted
to
bear
great
atmospheric
changes
often
they
rise
instantaneously
from
the
ground
far
up
into
the
air
where
the
cold
is
extreme
and
others
in
their
travels
fly
through
many
different
climates
in
short
just
as
anacreon
wished
to
be
changed
into
a
mirror
that
he
might
be
continually
regarded
by
the
mistress
of
his
heart
or
into
a
robe
that
he
might
cover
her
or
balm
to
anoint
her
or
water
to
wash
her
or
bands
that
she
might
draw
him
to
her
bosom
or
a
pearl
to
be
worn
on
her
neck
or
shoes
that
she
might
at
least
press
him
with
her
feet
so
i
should
like
temporarily
to
be
transformed
into
a
bird
in
order
to
experience
their
contentment
and
joyfulness
of
life

o

in

thee
thus

hast
thou
ever

seen
one
living
being
possessed
of
happiness
of
the
numberless
works
of

which
hitherto
thou

thou
that
a
single
one
was
successful
in
its
aim
of
procuring
satisfaction
durable
or
temporary
for
its
originator
and
seest
thou
or
hast
thou
ever
seen
happiness
within
the
boundaries
of
the

where
does
it
dwell
in
what
country

in

land
inhabited
or

planet
of
the
many

illumine

does
it
perchance
hide
from
thee
in

earth
or
the
depths
of
the
sea
what
living
being
what
plant
or
other
thing
animated
by
thee
what
vegetable
or

participates
in

and
thou
thyself
like
an
indefatigable

restless
the
vast

content

arouse

not

are
you
free
from

the
time
will
come
when
no
eternal
force
no
internal
agitation
shall
awaken
you
from
the
repose
of
sleep
in
which
you
shall
ever
and
insatiably
rest
for
the
present
death
is
not
granted
to
you
only
from

to
time
you
are
permitted
to
taste
briefly
its
resemblance
because
life
would
fail
were
it
not
often
suspended
too
long
abstention
from
this
short
and
fleeting
sleep
is
a
fatal
evil
and
causes
eternal
sleep
such
thing
is
life
that
to
secure
its
continuance
it
must
from
time
to
time
be
laid
aside
man
then
in
sleep
refreshes
himself
with
a
taste
and
as
it
were
a
fragment
of
death
it
seems
as
though
death
were
the
essential
aim
of
all
things
that
which
has
no
existence
can
not
die
yet
all
that
exists
has
proceeded
from
nothing
the
final
cause
of
existence
is
not
happiness
for
nothing
is
happy
it
is
true
living
creatures
seek
this
end
in
all
their
works
but
none
obtain
it
and
during
all
their
life
ever
deceiving
tormenting
and
exerting
themselves
they
suffer
indeed
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
die
the
earliest
part
of
the
day
is
ordinarily
the
most
bearable
for
living
beings
few
when
they
awake
find
again
in
their
minds
delightful
and
joyful
thoughts
but
almost
all
people
give
birth
to
them
for
the
time
being
for
then
the
minds
of
men
being
free
from
any
special
concentration
are
predisposed
to
joy
fulness
and
inclined
to
bear
evils
more
patiently
than
at
other
times
thus
a
man
who
falls
asleep
in
the
anguish
of
despair
is
filled
anew
with
hope
when
he
awakes
though
it
can
profit
him
nothing
many
misfortunes
and
peculiar
hardships
many
causes
of
fear
and
distress
then
seem
less
formidable
than
they
appeared
the
previous
evening
often
also
the
pangs
of
yesterday
are
remembered
with
contempt
and
are
ridiculed
as
follies
and
vain
fancies
the
evening
is
comparable
to
old
age
and
on
the
other
hand
the
dawn
of
the
morning
resembles
youth
the
one
full
of
comfort
and
hope
and
then
sad
evening
with
its
discouragement
and
tendencies
to
look
on
the
dark
side
of
things
but
just
as
the
time
of
youth
in
life
is
very
short
and
fleeting
so
is
the
infancy
of
each
new
day
which
quickly
ages
towards
its
evening
youth
if
indeed
it
be
the
best
of
life
is
a
very
wretched
thing
yet
even
this
poor
benefit
is
so
soon
over
that
when
by
many
signs
man
is
led
to
perceive
the
decline
of
his
existence
he
has
scarcely
experienced
its
perfection
or
fully
realised
its
peculiar
strength
which
once
diminished
the
best
part
of
life
is
gone
with
every
race
of
mortals
thus
in
all
her
works
nature
turns
and
points
towards
death
for
old
age
reigns
universally
every
part
of
the
world
hastens
untiringly
with
diligence
and
wonderful
celerity
towards
death
the
world
itself
alone
seems
exempt
from
decay
for
although
in
autumn
and
winter
it
appears
as
it
were
sick
and
aged
nevertheless
in
the
spring
it
ever
rejuvenates
but
just
as
mortals
in
the
first
part
of
each
day
regain
some
portion
of
their
youth
yet
grow
old
as
the
day
progresses
and
are
at
length
extinguished
in
sleep
so
although
in
the
beginning
of
the
year
the
world
becomes
young
again
none
the
less
it
perpetually
ages
the
time
will
come
when
this
world
and
nature
herself
shall
die
and
as
at
the
present
day
there
remains
no
trace
nor
record
of
many
very
great
kingdoms
and
empires
so
in
the
whole
world
there
shall
not
he
left
a
vestige
of
the
infinite
changes
and
catastrophes
of
created
things
a
naked
silence
and
an
utter
calm
shall
fill
the
vast
space
thus
this
wonderful
and
fearful
mystery
of
universal
existence
shall
be
unloosed
and
shall
melt
away
before
it
be
made
manifest
or
be
comprehended
footnote
this
is
a
poetical
not
philosophical
conclusion
speaking
philosophically
existence
which
has
had
no
beginning
will
have
no
ending
between
timandro
and
i
am
very
anxious
to
have
some
conversation
with
you
it
is
about
the
matter
and
tendency
of
your
writings
and
words
which
seem
to
me
most
blamable
so
long
as
you
find
no
fault
with
my
actions
i
confess
i
do
not
much
care
because
words
and
writings
are
of
little
consequence
there
is
nothing
in
your
actions
as
far
as
i
can
see
for
which
i
need
blame
you
i
am
aware
that
you
benefit
no
one
because
you
can
not
do
so
and
i
observe
that
you
injure
no
one
because
you
are
unwilling
to
do
so
but
i
consider
your
speech
and
writings
very
reprehensible
and
i
do
not
agree
with
you
that
they
are
of
little
importance
our
life
may
almost
be
said
to
consist
of
nothing
else
for
the
present
we
will
disregard
the
words
and
simply
consider
the
writings
in
the
first
place
the
incessant
vituperation
and
continuous
satire
that
you
bestow
on
the
human
race
are
out
of
fashion
my
brain
also
is
out
of
fashion
it
is
quite
natural
for
a
child
to
resemble
its
father
then
you
must
not
be
surprised
if
your
books
like
everything
contrary
to
the
custom
of
the
day
are
ill
received
that
is
a
small
misfortune
they
were
not
written
for
the
purpose
of
begging
a
little
bread
at
the
doors
of
the
rich
forty
or
fifty
years
ago
philosophers
used
to
say
hard
things
about
the
human
race
but
now
they
do
just
the
contrary
do
you
believe
that
forty
or
fifty
years
ago
the
philosophers
were
right
or
wrong
in
their
statements
more
often
right
than
wrong
do
you
think
that
in
these
forty
or
fifty
years
the
human
race
has
changed
to
the
opposite
of
what
it
then
was
not
at
all
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
why
not
has
humanity
progressed
in
strength
and
perfection
that
the
writers
of
should
be
constrained
to
flatter
and
compelled
to
reverence
it
what
have
such
pleasantries
to
do
with
so
grave
a
matter
then
seriously
i
am
not
unaware
that
the
people
of
this
century
although
continuing
to
their
as
their
ancestors
did
have
yet
a
very
high
opinion
of
themselves
such
as
men
of
the
past
century
did
not
possess
but
i
who
no
one
do
not
see
that
i
am
obliged
to
speak
well
of
others
against
my
conscience
you
must
however
like
all
men
endeavour
to
serve
your
race
if
my
race
on
the
contrary
does
its
best
to
injure
me
i
do
not
see
that
this
obligation
holds
as
you
say
but
supposing
you
are
right
what
ought
i
to
do
if
i
can
not
be
useful
to
my
race
by
actions
perhaps
you
may
be
unable
to
be
of
much
use
such
power
is
in
the
hands
of
but
few
people
but
by
your
writings
you
can
and
indeed
ought
to
serve
it
and
the
race
is
not
benefited
by
books
which
snarl
incessantly
at
men
in
general
such
behaviour
is
on
the
contrary
extremely
injurious
i
admit
that
it
does
no
good
but
i
also
imagine
it
does
no
harm
do
you
however
think
books
are
able
to
help
the
human
race
not
i
only
but
all
the
world
think
so
what
kind
of
books
many
kinds
but
especially
books
treating
of
morals
all
the
world
does
not
think
so
because
i
amongst
others
do
not
as
a
woman
once
said
to
socrates
if
books
of
morals
could
be
useful
to
men
i
should
place
poetry
above
all
others
i
use
the
word
poetry
in
its
widest
sense
as
including
all
writings
the
aim
of
which
is
to
excite
the
imagination
whether
in
prose
or
verse
now
i
hold
in
little
esteem
that
sort
of
poetry
which
when
read
and
meditated
over
does
not
leave
in
the
mind
of
the
reader
a
sufficiently
elevating
sentiment
to
deter
him
for
half
an
hour
from
giving
way
to
a
single
base
thought
or
unworthy
action
if
however
the
reader
commits
for
example
a
breach
of
faith
towards
his
best
friend
an
hour
after
such
reading
i
do
not
condemn
the
poetry
for
that
because
then
the
finest
most
stirring
and
noblest
poetry
the
world
possesses
would
come
under
condemnation
exceptions
to
this
influence
are
readers
who
live
in
great
cities
these
people
however
great
their
concentration
can
not
forget
themselves
for
even
half
an
hour
nor
are
they
much
pleased
or
moved
by
any
sort
of
poetry
you
speak
as
usual
maliciously
and
so
as
to
leave
an
impression
that
you
are
habitually
by
others
this
in
most
instances
is
the
true
cause
of
the
and
contempt
exhibited
by
certain
people
towards
their
race
indeed
i
can
not
say
that
men
have
treated
or
do
treat
me
very
well
if
i
could
say
so
i
imagine
i
should
be
unique
in
my
experience
but
neither
have
they
done
me
any
serious
harm
because
in
demanding
nothing
from
men
and
having
nothing
in
common
with
them
i
scarcely
give
them
a
chance
of
offending
me
i
must
confess
however
that
recognising
clearly
as
i
do
how
ignorant
i
am
of
the
simplest
means
of
making
myself
agreeable
to
others
both
in
conversation
and
the
daily
intercourse
of
life
whether
from
a
natural
defect
or
fault
of
my
own
i
should
esteem
men
less
if
they
treated
me
better
then
you
are
so
much
the
more
to
blame
for
had
you
even
a
mistaken
ground
of
complaint
your
hatred
and
desire
for
revenge
against
men
would
be
in
a
measure
justifiable
but
your
hatred
from
what
you
say
is
based
on
nothing
in
particular
except
perhaps
an
extraordinary
and
wretched
ambition
of
becoming
famous
as
a
misanthrope
like
timon
a
desire
abominable
in
itself
and
especially
out
of
place
in
a
century
like
the
present
so
peculiarly
devoted
to
philanthropy
i
need
not
reply
to
your
remark
about
ambition
because
i
have
already
said
that
i
want
nothing
from
men
does
that
seem
incredible
to
you
you
will
at
least
grant
that
it
is
not
ambition
which
urges
me
to
write
books
such
as
on
your
own
showing
are
more
likely
to
bring
me
reproaches
than
glory
besides
i
am
so
far
from
hating
the
human
race
that
i
neither
can
nor
wish
to
hate
even
those
who
particularly
offend
me
indeed
the
fact
that
hatred
is
so
completely
foreign
to
me
goes
far
to
explain
my
inability
to
do
as
other
men
do
but
i
can
not
change
this
because
i
always
think
that
whenever
a
man
displeases
or
injures
another
he
does
so
in
the
hope
of
procuring
some
pleasure
or
advantage
for
himself
his
aim
is
not
to
injure
others
which
can
never
be
the
motive
of
any
action
nor
the
object
of
any
thought
but
to
benefit
himself
a
natural
desire
and
undeserving
of
odium
again
whenever
i
notice
a
particular
vice
or
fault
in
my
neighbour
i
carefully
examine
myself
and
as
far
as
circumstances
will
allow
i
put
myself
in
his
place
thereupon
i
invariably
find
that
i
should
have
done
the
same
as
he
and
been
guilty
of
the
same
faults
consequently
my
mind
loses
what
irritation
it
previously
felt
i
reserve
my
wrath
for
occasions
when
i
might
see
some
wickedness
of
which
my
nature
is
incapable
but
so
far
i
have
never
met
with
such
a
case
finally
the
thought
of
the
vanity
of
human
things
is
so
constantly
in
my
mind
that
i
am
unable
to
excite
myself
about
any
one
of
them
hatred
and
anger
seem
to
me
great
and
strong
passions
out
of
harmony
with
the
insignificance
of
life
thus
you
see
there
is
a
great
difference
between
timon
and
myself
timon
hated
and
shunned
all
men
except
alcibiades
for
whom
he
reserved
all
his
affection
because
he
saw
in
him
the
initiator
of
innumerable
evils
for
their
common
country
i
on
the
other
hand
without
hating
alcibiades
would
have
especially
avoided
him
i
would
have
warned
my
of
their
danger
exhorting
them
at
the
same
time
to
take
the
requisite
steps
to
preserve
themselves
from
it
some
say
that
timon
did
not
hate
men
but
beasts
in
the
likeness
of
men
as
for
me
i
neither
hate
men
nor
beasts
nor
do
you
love
any
one
listen
my
friend
i
am
born
to
love
i
have
loved
and
perhaps
with
as
deep
a
passion
as
is
possible
for
human
soul
to
feel
although
as
you
see
i
am
not
sufficiently
old
to
be
naturally
devoid
of
passion
nor
even
of
a
lukewarm
age
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
that
i
love
no
one
except
myself
by
the
necessity
of
nature
and
that
as
little
as
possible
nevertheless
i
would
always
rather
bear
suffering
myself
than
be
the
cause
of
it
to
others
i
believe
you
can
bear
witness
to
the
truth
of
this
little
as
you
know
about
my
habits
i
do
not
deny
it
i
try
to
procure
for
men
even
at
my
own
expense
that
greatest
possible
good
which
alone
i
seek
for
myself
a
state
of
freedom
from
suffering
but
do
you
distinctly
confess
that
you
do
not
love
the
human
race
in
general
yes
absolutely
but
in
such
a
way
that
if
it
depended
on
me
i
would
punish
those
who
deserved
punishment
without
hating
them
as
also
i
would
benefit
my
race
to
the
utmost
although
i
do
not
love
it
well
it
may
be
so
but
then
if
you
are
not
incited
by
injuries
received
nor
by
hatred
nor
ambition
why
do
you
write
in
such
a
manner
for
many
reasons
first
because
i
can
not
tolerate
deceit
and
dissimulation
i
may
sometimes
have
to
give
way
to
these
in
conversation
but
never
in
my
writings
because
i
am
often
obliged
to
speak
unwillingly
but
i
never
write
unless
i
please
i
should
derive
no
satisfaction
from
puzzling
my
brains
and
expressing
the
result
on
paper
unless
i
could
write
what
i
really
think
all
sensible
people
laugh
at
those
who
write
latin
because
no
one
speaks
and
few
understand
the
language
i
think
it
is
equally
absurd
to
take
for
granted
whether
in
conversation
or
writing
the
reality
of
certain
human
qualities
no
longer
extant
and
the
existence
of
certain
rational
beings
formerly
considered
as
divinities
but
now
really
regarded
as
equally
by
those
who
mention
them
and
those
who
hear
them
mentioned
i
could
understand
men
using
masks
and
disguises
in
order
to
deceive
other
men
or
to
avoid
being
recognised
but
it
seems
childish
for
them
all
to
conceal
themselves
behind
the
same
kind
of
mask
and
use
the
same
disguise
whereby
they
deceive
no
one
but
recognise
each
other
perfectly
in
spite
of
it
let
them
lay
aside
their
masks
and
retain
merely
their
clothes
the
effect
will
be
precisely
the
same
and
they
will
be
more
at
ease
besides
this
perpetual
simulation
though
useless
and
this
eternal
acting
of
a
part
between
which
and
oneself
there
is
nothing
in
common
can
not
be
carried
on
without
fatigue
and
weariness
if
men
had
passed
suddenly
instead
of
gradually
from
the
savage
condition
to
their
present
state
of
civilisation
would
the
names
of
the
things
just
mentioned
be
found
in
general
usage
with
the
custom
of
deducing
from
them
a
thousand
philosophical
conclusions
in
truth
this
custom
seems
to
me
like
one
of
those
ceremonies
and
ancient
practices
so
incompatible
with
our
present
habits
which
nevertheless
continue
to
exist
by
force
of
usage
i
for
my
part
can
not
submit
to
these
ceremonies
and
i
write
in
the
language
of
modern
times
not
that
of
the
trojan
era
in
the
second
place
i
do
not
so
much
in
my
writings
find
fault
with
the
human
race
as
grieve
over
its
destiny
there
is
nothing
i
think
more
clear
and
palpable
than
the
necessary
unhappiness
of
all
living
beings
if
this
unhappiness
be
not
a
fact
then
all
my
arguments
are
wrong
and
we
may
abandon
the
discussion
if
it
be
true
why
may
i
not
lament
openly
and
freely
and
say
that
i
suffer
doubtless
if
i
did
nothing
but
weep
incessantly
this
is
the
third
cause
which
moves
me
i
should
become
a
nuisance
to
others
as
well
as
myself
without
profiting
any
one
but
in
laughing
at
our
misfortunes
we
do
much
to
remedy
them
i
endeavour
therefore
to
persuade
others
to
profit
in
this
way
as
i
have
done
whether
i
succeed
or
not
i
feel
assured
that
such
laughter
is
the
only
solace
and
remedy
that
can
be
found
the
poets
say
that
despair
has
always
a
smile
on
its
lips
but
you
must
not
think
that
i
am
devoid
of
compassion
for
the
unhappiness
of
humanity
its
condition
is
incurable
by
art
industry
or
anything
else
therefore
i
consider
it
far
more
manly
and
consistent
with
a
magnanimous
despair
to
laugh
at
our
common
woes
than
to
sigh
weep
and
moan
with
others
thereby
encouraging
them
in
their
lamentations
lastly
permit
me
to
say
that
i
desire
as
much
as
you
or
any
one
else
the
welfare
of
my
race
in
general
but
i
am
hopeless
of
its
attainment
nor
can
i
like
so
many
philosophers
of
this
century
nourish
and
soothe
my
mind
with
anticipations
of
good
my
despair
is
absolute
unchangeable
and
so
based
on
firm
judgment
and
conviction
that
i
can
not
imagine
such
a
thing
as
a
joyous
future
nor
can
i
undertake
anything
with
the
hope
of
bringing
it
to
completion
and
you
are
well
aware
that
man
is
never
inclined
to
attempt
what
he
knows
or
thinks
can
not
succeed
or
if
he
does
he
acts
feebly
and
without
confidence
similarly
a
writer
who
expresses
himself
contrary
to
his
real
opinion
though
this
be
erroneous
utters
nothing
worthy
of
consideration
but
when
his
judgment
is
like
yours
a
false
one
he
should
rectify
it
my
judgment
is
of
myself
alone
and
i
am
quite
sure
i
do
not
err
in
announcing
my
unhappiness
if
other
men
are
happy
i
congratulate
them
with
all
my
heart
i
know
also
that
death
alone
can
deliver
me
from
my
misfortune
if
others
are
more
hopeful
i
rejoice
once
again
we
are
all
unhappy
and
have
always
been
so
i
scarcely
think
you
can
take
credit
for
the
novelty
of
your
idea
but
man
present
condition
superior
as
it
is
to
his
past
will
be
greatly
improved
in
the
future
you
forget
or
seem
to
disregard
the
fact
that
man
is
perfectible
perfectible
he
may
be
but
that
he
is
capable
of
perfection
which
is
of
more
importance
i
know
not
who
can
convince
me
he
has
not
yet
had
time
to
reach
perfection
ultimately
he
will
no
doubt
attain
to
it
i
do
not
doubt
it
the
few
years
that
have
passed
since
the
world
began
are
i
agree
with
you
quite
insufficient
to
complete
our
education
we
can
not
judge
from
what
seem
to
us
the
nature
and
capabilities
of
man
besides
humanity
hitherto
has
been
too
occupied
with
other
business
to
give
itself
up
to
the
task
of
attaining
perfection
but
in
future
all
its
endeavours
will
be
towards
this
one
aim
yes
the
whole
civilised
world
is
working
zealously
towards
this
end
and
taking
into
consideration
the
number
and
sufficiency
of
the
means
employed
which
have
indeed
recently
increased
in
an
astounding
manner
we
have
every
reason
to
think
that
the
goal
will
be
reached
sooner
or
later
this
conviction
itself
is
by
no
means
one
of
the
least
stimulants
to
progress
because
it
gives
birth
to
a
host
of
undertakings
and
labours
useful
for
the
common
welfare
if
then
at
any
time
it
was
fatal
and
blâmable
to
manifest
despair
like
yours
and
to
teach
men
such
doctrines
as
the
absolute
necessity
of
their
wretchedness
the
vanity
of
life
the
insignificance
of
their
race
and
the
evil
of
their
nature
much
more
is
it
so
in
the
present
day
such
conduct
can
only
result
in
depriving
us
of
courage
and
that
feeling
of
which
is
the
foundation
of
an
honest
useful
and
glorious
life
it
will
also
divert
us
from
the
path
of
our
own
welfare
kindly
say
distinctly
whether
or
not
you
regard
as
true
what
i
have
said
about
the
unhappiness
of
mankind
you
return
to
your
old
argument
well
supposing
i
admit
the
truth
of
what
you
say
how
does
that
alter
the
matter
i
would
remind
you
that
it
is
not
always
well
to
preach
truth
simply
because
it
is
truth
answer
me
another
question
are
these
truths
which
i
merely
express
without
any
pretence
of
preaching
of
primary
or
secondary
importance
in
philosophy
in
my
opinion
they
are
the
very
essence
of
all
philosophy
in
that
case
they
greatly
deceive
themselves
who
affirm
that
man
perfection
consists
in
complete
knowledge
of
the
truth
that
his
misfortunes
are
the
consequence
of
his
ignorance
and
prejudices
and
that
the
human
race
will
be
happy
when
men
have
discovered
the
truth
and
conform
their
lives
to
its
teaching
yet
such
doctrines
are
taught
by
most
philosophers
ancient
and
modern
but
you
are
of
opinion
that
these
truths
though
confessedly
the
substance
of
all
philosophy
ought
to
be
concealed
from
the
majority
of
men
you
would
rather
that
they
were
unknown
or
disregarded
by
all
men
because
of
the
baneful
influence
they
exercise
over
the
mind
and
this
is
equivalent
to
an
admission
that
philosophy
ought
to
be
banished
from
the
earth
i
grant
you
however
that
the
final
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
true
and
perfect
philosophy
is
that
it
were
better
to
dispense
with
philosophy
it
would
therefore
seem
that
first
of
all
philosophy
is
superfluous
since
its
conclusions
are
attainable
without
its
assistance
secondly
it
is
extremely
injurious
because
its
conclusion
is
a
very
painful
one
to
be
accepted
and
when
accepted
is
useless
nor
is
it
in
power
to
disregard
truths
once
recognised
besides
the
habit
of
philosophising
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
habits
to
throw
off
thus
philosophy
which
at
first
inspires
hope
as
a
possible
remedy
for
the
ills
of
humanity
ends
by
seeking
in
vain
a
cure
for
itself
and
now
i
would
ask
you
why
you
imagine
we
are
nearer
perfection
than
our
ancestors
were
is
it
that
we
are
better
acquainted
with
the
truth
this
can
not
be
since
we
have
seen
that
such
knowledge
is
extremely
prejudicial
to
man
happiness
perhaps
however
it
is
because
some
few
men
in
the
present
day
have
learnt
that
the
truest
philosopher
is
he
who
abstains
from
philosophy
but
in
what
then
are
we
superior
to
the
men
of
primitive
times
who
were
perfectly
unacquainted
with
philosophy
and
even
in
the
present
day
savages
abstain
from
philosophy
without
feeling
the
least
inconvenience
in
what
therefore
are
we
more
advanced
than
our
ancestors
and
what
means
of
attaining
perfection
do
we
possess
which
they
had
not
we
have
many
of
great
importance
to
explain
them
would
be
a
work
of
considerable
time
put
them
aside
for
the
moment
and
reconsider
my
theory
i
say
that
if
on
the
one
hand
i
express
in
my
writings
certain
hard
and
bitter
truths
whether
to
relieve
my
mind
or
console
myself
in
laughing
at
them
i
do
not
fail
at
the
same
time
to
deplore
and
disadvise
the
search
after
that
cold
and
miserable
truth
acquaintance
with
which
reduces
us
to
a
state
of
either
indifference
and
hypocrisy
or
baseness
of
soul
moral
corruption
and
depravity
and
on
the
other
hand
i
praise
and
exalt
those
noble
if
false
ideas
which
give
birth
to
and
vigorous
actions
and
thoughts
such
as
further
the
welfare
of
mankind
or
individuals
those
glorious
illusions
vain
though
they
be
which
give
value
to
life
and
which
are
natural
to
the
soul
in
short
the
superstitions
of
antiquity
distinct
from
the
errors
of
barbarism
these
latter
should
be
rooted
out
but
the
former
respected
civilisation
and
philosophy
having
exceeded
their
natural
bounds
as
is
usual
with
all
things
pertaining
to
humanity
have
drawn
us
from
one
state
of
barbarism
only
to
precipitate
us
into
another
no
better
than
the
first
this
new
barbarism
born
of
reason
and
science
instead
of
ignorance
manifests
itself
more
in
the
mind
than
the
body
yet
i
imagine
that
though
these
superstitions
become
daily
more
necessary
for
the
of
civilised
nations
the
possibility
of
their
diminishes
daily
and
as
for
man
perfection
i
assure
you
if
i
had
perceived
any
signs
of
it
i
would
have
written
a
volume
in
praise
of
the
human
race
but
since
i
have
not
yet
seen
it
and
as
it
is
improbable
i
ever
shall
see
it
i
think
of
leaving
in
my
will
a
certain
sum
of
money
for
the
purpose
of
procuring
an
annual
panegyric
of
the
human
race
to
be
publicly
recited
from
the
time
of
its
perfection
and
to
pay
for
the
erection
of
a
temple
statue
or
monument
as
may
be
judged
best
to
commemorate
the
event
dialogue
in
four
first
hour
and
the
good
day
excellency
thanks
as
well
the
horses
are
waiting
your
excellency
very
well
and
the
morning
star
has
been
up
some
time
all
right
let
it
rise
and
set
just
as
it
pleases
what
do
i
hear
your
excellency
say
i
wish
you
would
leave
me
alone
but
excellency
the
night
has
already
lasted
so
long
that
it
can
last
no
longer
and
if
we
delay
imagine
excellency
the
confusion
that
will
ensue
i
do
mean
to
stir
whatever
happens
excellency
what
is
this
does
your
excellency
feel
ill
no
no
i
feel
nothing
except
that
i
do
wish
to
move
so
you
can
go
and
attend
to
your
own
affairs
how
can
i
go
unless
your
excellency
comes
i
am
the
first
hour
of
the
day
and
how
can
the
day
exist
if
your
excellency
does
not
deign
to
go
forth
as
usual
if
you
will
not
be
of
the
day
you
shall
be
of
the
night
or
better
the
hours
of
the
night
shall
do
double
duty
and
you
and
your
companions
shall
be
idle
for
you
must
know
i
am
tired
of
this
eternal
going
round
to
give
light
to
a
race
of
little
animals
that
live
far
away
in
a
ball
of
clay
so
small
that
i
who
have
good
sight
can
not
see
it
during
the
night
i
have
decided
not
to
trouble
myself
any
more
in
this
fashion
if
men
want
light
let
them
make
their
own
fires
for
the
purpose
or
provide
it
in
some
other
way
but
excellency
how
can
the
little
fellows
manage
that
it
will
be
a
very
great
expense
for
them
to
keep
lanterns
or
candles
burning
all
day
long
if
only
they
could
now
discover
a
certain
atmosphere
to
warm
and
illumine
their
streets
rooms
shops
taverns
and
everything
else
at
little
expense
then
they
would
not
be
so
badly
off
but
men
will
have
to
wait
some
three
hundred
years
more
or
less
before
they
discover
this
and
meanwhile
all
the
oil
wax
pitch
and
tallow
of
the
earth
will
be
exhausted
and
they
will
have
nothing
more
to
burn
let
them
hunt
the
and
catch
those
shining
things
called
and
how
will
they
protect
themselves
against
the
cold
for
without
the
assistance
of
your
excellency
all
the
forests
together
will
not
make
a
fire
large
enough
to
warm
them
besides
they
will
also
die
of
hunger
since
the
earth
will
no
longer
bring
forth
its
fruits
and
so
after
a
few
years
the
seed
of
the
poor
little
folk
will
be
lost
they
will
go
groping
about
the
earth
seeking
food
and
warmth
until
having
consumed
every
possible
thing
and
used
up
the
last
flicker
of
fire
they
will
all
die
in
the
darkness
frozen
like
pieces
of
what
is
this
to
do
with
me
am
i
the
nurse
of
the
human
race
or
the
cook
that
i
should
look
after
the
preparation
of
their
food
and
why
need
i
care
if
a
few
invisible
little
creatures
millions
of
miles
away
from
me
are
unable
to
see
or
bear
the
cold
when
deprived
of
my
light
and
warmth
besides
even
supposing
as
you
say
that
i
ought
to
act
the
part
of
stove
or
fireplace
to
this
human
family
surely
it
is
more
reasonable
if
men
want
to
warm
themselves
that
they
should
come
to
the
stove
than
that
the
stove
should
go
whirling
round
them
therefore
if
the
earth
requires
me
let
it
come
hither
to
satisfy
its
needs
i
want
nothing
from
the
earth
that
i
should
thus
trouble
myself
to
rotate
round
it
your
excellency
means
if
i
understand
rightly
that
henceforth
the
earth
must
do
for
itself
that
which
hitherto
you
have
done
on
its
behalf
yes
now
and
for
the
future
well
your
excellency
knows
best
what
is
right
and
can
do
as
it
pleases
you
but
nevertheless
will
your
excellency
deign
to
think
what
a
number
of
beautiful
and
useful
things
will
be
destroyed
by
this
new
decree
the
day
will
be
deprived
of
its
handsome
gilded
chariot
and
beautiful
horses
which
bathe
themselves
in
the
sea
amongst
other
changes
we
poor
hours
must
suffer
we
shall
no
longer
have
a
place
in
heaven
but
shall
have
to
descend
from
our
position
as
celestial
children
to
that
of
terrestrials
unless
as
is
more
probable
we
dissolve
into
thin
air
instead
but
be
that
as
it
may
the
difficulty
will
be
to
persuade
the
earth
to
go
round
necessarily
a
hard
thing
because
it
is
unaccustomed
to
do
so
and
the
experience
of
rotating
and
exerting
itself
incessantly
will
be
all
the
more
strange
seeing
that
hitherto
it
has
never
stirred
from
its
present
position
if
then
your
excellency
now
begins
to
think
of
idleness
i
fear
the
earth
will
be
as
little
desirous
of
bestirring
itself
as
ever
it
was
in
that
case
it
must
be
pricked
and
made
to
bestir
itself
as
much
as
is
necessary
but
the
quickest
and
surest
way
is
to
find
a
poet
or
better
a
philosopher
who
will
persuade
the
earth
to
move
itself
or
persuasion
being
unsuccessful
will
use
force
eor
philosophers
and
poets
ordinarily
manage
these
affairs
when
i
was
younger
i
used
to
have
a
great
esteem
for
the
poets
though
they
rather
caricatured
me
in
representing
me
racing
madly
great
and
stout
as
i
am
round
and
round
a
grain
of
sand
simply
for
the
sake
of
amusement
or
exercise
but
now
that
i
am
older
i
am
more
partial
to
philosophy
i
study
to
discern
the
utility
not
the
beauty
of
things
and
poetry
seems
to
me
either
absurd
or
wearisome
i
wish
also
to
have
good
substantial
reasons
for
whatever
i
do
now
i
see
no
reason
why
i
should
value
a
life
of
activity
more
than
a
life
of
ease
and
idleness
i
have
determined
therefore
in
future
to
leave
the
fatigues
and
discomforts
to
others
and
for
my
own
part
to
live
quietly
at
home
without
undertaking
business
of
any
kind
this
change
in
me
is
partly
due
to
my
age
but
has
chiefly
been
brought
about
by
the
philosophers
a
race
of
people
whose
power
and
influence
increase
daily
consequently
to
induce
the
earth
to
rotate
in
my
place
a
poet
would
intrinsically
be
better
than
a
philosopher
because
the
poets
are
accustomed
to
give
a
fictitious
value
to
things
by
exaggerating
the
truth
beauty
and
utility
of
subjects
about
which
they
treat
and
because
by
raising
a
thousand
pleasurable
hopes
they
often
incite
people
to
fatigues
they
would
else
have
avoided
whereas
philosophers
weary
them
but
now
that
the
power
of
philosophers
is
so
predominant
i
doubt
whether
a
poet
would
be
of
much
use
if
even
the
earth
gave
him
a
hearing
therefore
we
had
better
have
recourse
to
a
philosopher
it
is
true
philosophers
are
usually
little
suited
and
still
less
inclined
to
stimulate
other
people
to
exertions
but
possibly
in
so
extreme
a
case
they
may
be
induced
to
act
contrary
to
custom
the
earth
has
however
one
alternative
it
has
the
option
of
declining
to
undertake
all
this
hard
labour
its
destruction
will
then
ensue
and
i
am
far
from
sure
that
this
would
not
be
the
best
thing
for
it
but
enough
of
this
we
shall
see
what
will
take
place
now
either
you
or
one
of
your
companions
had
better
go
at
once
to
the
earth
if
there
you
discover
any
one
of
these
philosophers
in
the
open
air
regarding
the
heavens
and
wondering
about
the
cause
of
this
protracted
night
as
well
he
may
take
charge
of
him
and
bring
him
hither
on
your
back
do
you
clearly
understand
yes
excellency
you
shall
be
obeyed
copernicus
pacing
the
terrace
of
his
house
with
his
eyes
anxiously
directed
towards
the
eastern
horizon
a
roll
of
paper
in
his
hand
which
ever
and
anon
he
uses
as
a
this
is
a
marvellous
thing
either
the
clocks
are
all
wrong
or
else
the
sun
should
have
risen
more
than
an
hour
ago
yet
not
a
gleam
of
light
is
to
be
seen
in
the
east
though
the
sky
is
as
bright
and
clear
as
a
mirror
all
the
stars
shine
as
if
it
were
midnight
i
must
go
and
consult
the
almagest
and
sacrobosco
and
see
what
they
say
about
this
event
i
have
often
heard
talk
of
the
night
jove
passed
with
the
wife
of
amphitryon
and
i
also
remember
reading
a
little
while
ago
in
a
modern
spanish
book
that
the
peruvians
record
a
very
long
night
at
the
end
of
which
the
sun
proceeded
forth
from
a
certain
lake
called
titicaca
hitherto
i
have
regarded
these
as
mere
tales
and
have
never
wavered
in
my
belief
now
however
that
i
perceive
reason
and
science
to
be
absolutely
useless
i
am
determined
to
believe
the
truth
of
these
and
similar
things
i
will
also
visit
the
lakes
and
puddles
in
the
neighbourhood
and
see
if
i
can
fish
out
the
sun
ha
what
is
this
that
i
hear
it
is
like
the
flapping
of
the
wings
of
some
huge
bird
last
hour
and
copernicus
i
am
the
last
hour
the
last
hour
well
i
suppose
i
must
be
resigned
but
i
beg
of
you
if
possible
to
give
me
enough
time
to
make
my
will
and
put
my
things
in
order
before
i
die
die
what
do
you
mean
i
am
not
the
last
hour
of
your
life
oh
then
what
are
you
the
last
hour
of
the
office
of
the
breviary
i
can
quite
imagine
you
prefer
that
one
to
the
others
when
you
are
in
your
stall
but
how
do
you
know
i
am
a
canon
and
how
is
it
you
know
my
name
i
procured
my
information
about
you
from
certain
people
in
the
street
i
am
in
fact
the
last
hour
of
day
ah
now
i
understand
the
first
hour
is
unwell
and
that
is
why
day
is
not
yet
visible
i
have
news
for
you
there
will
never
be
any
more
daylight
unless
you
provide
it
yourself
you
would
throw
on
me
the
responsibility
of
making
daylight
a
fine
thing
indeed
i
will
tell
you
how
but
first
of
all
you
must
come
with
me
at
once
to
the
house
of
the
sun
my
father
you
shall
hear
more
when
we
set
out
his
excellency
will
explain
everything
when
we
arrive
i
trust
it
is
all
right
but
the
journey
unless
i
am
mistaken
must
be
a
very
long
one
and
how
can
i
take
enough
food
to
prevent
my
dying
of
hunger
a
few
years
before
reaching
the
sun
besides
i
doubt
if
his
excellency
lands
produce
the
to
supply
me
with
even
a
single
meal
do
not
trouble
yourself
with
these
doubts
you
will
not
stay
long
in
my
father
house
and
the
journey
will
be
completed
in
a
moment
for
you
must
know
that
i
am
a
spirit
maybe
but
i
am
a
body
well
well
you
are
not
a
metaphysician
that
you
need
excite
yourself
about
these
matters
come
now
mount
on
my
shoulders
and
leave
all
the
rest
to
me
courage
there
it
is
done
i
will
pursue
this
novelty
to
its
issue
and
the
most
noble
lord
forgive
me
copernicus
if
i
do
not
offer
you
a
chair
one
does
not
use
such
things
here
but
we
will
soon
despatch
our
business
my
servant
has
already
explained
the
matter
to
you
and
from
what
the
child
tells
me
i
imagine
you
will
do
very
well
for
our
purpose
my
lord
i
discern
great
difficulties
in
the
matter
difficulties
ought
not
to
frighten
such
a
man
as
yourself
they
are
even
said
to
make
the
brave
man
still
more
courageous
but
tell
me
briefly
of
what
these
difficulties
consist
in
the
first
place
although
philosophy
is
a
great
power
i
doubt
whether
it
can
persuade
the
earth
to
change
its
comfortable
sitting
posture
for
a
state
of
restless
activity
especially
in
these
times
which
are
not
heroic
and
if
persuasion
be
ineffectual
you
must
try
force
willingly
illustrious
if
i
were
a
hercules
or
even
an
orlando
instead
of
a
mere
canon
of
varmia
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
did
not
one
of
your
ancient
mathematicians
say
that
if
he
had
standing
room
given
him
outside
the
world
he
would
undertake
to
move
heaven
and
earth
now
you
are
not
required
to
move
heaven
and
behold
you
are
already
in
a
place
outside
the
earth
therefore
unless
you
are
not
so
clever
as
that
ancient
you
will
no
doubt
be
able
to
move
the
earth
whether
it
be
willing
or
not
my
lord
such
a
thing
might
be
possible
but
a
lever
would
be
necessary
of
such
dimensions
that
neither
i
nor
even
your
illustrious
lordship
could
pay
half
the
cost
of
its
materials
and
manufacture
there
are
however
other
and
far
more
serious
difficulties
which
i
will
now
mention
you
know
the
earth
has
hitherto
occupied
the
principal
position
in
the
universe
that
is
the
centre
motionless
it
has
had
nothing
to
do
but
regard
all
the
other
spheres
great
and
small
brilliant
and
obscure
continuously
gyrating
around
and
on
all
sides
of
it
with
a
marvellous
regularity
and
speed
all
things
seem
to
be
occupied
in
its
service
so
that
the
universe
may
be
likened
to
a
court
in
the
midst
of
which
the
earth
sits
as
on
a
throne
surrounded
by
attendant
globes
like
courtiers
guards
and
servants
each
of
which
fulfils
its
respective
office
consequently
the
earth
has
always
regarded
itself
as
empress
of
the
universe
so
far
indeed
little
fault
can
be
found
with
its
control
and
i
do
not
think
your
design
an
improvement
on
the
old
state
of
affairs
but
what
shall
i
say
to
you
about
men
we
esteem
ourselves
and
shall
always
do
so
to
be
in
the
same
relation
to
the
rest
of
created
beings
as
the
earth
is
to
the
universe
and
more
than
this
supreme
among
terrestrial
creatures
we
all
including
the
ragged
beggar
who
dines
on
a
morsel
of
black
bread
have
a
most
exalted
idea
of
ourselves
we
are
each
of
us
emperors
and
our
empire
is
only
bounded
by
the
universe
for
it
includes
all
the
stars
and
planets
visible
and
invisible
man
is
in
his
own
estimation
the
final
cause
of
all
things
including
even
your
illustrious
lordship
now
if
we
remove
the
earth
from
its
place
in
the
centre
and
make
it
whirl
round
and
round
unremittingly
what
will
be
the
consequence
simply
that
it
will
act
like
all
the
other
globes
and
be
enrolled
in
the
number
of
the
planets
then
all
its
terrestrial
majesty
will
vanish
and
the
earth
will
have
to
abdicate
its
imperial
throne
men
too
will
lose
their
human
majesty
and
be
deprived
of
their
supremacy
they
will
be
left
alone
with
their
rags
and
miseries
which
are
not
insignificant
in
short
don
nicolas
what
do
you
wish
to
prove
by
this
discourse
is
it
that
you
have
scruples
of
conscience
lest
the
deed
should
be
treasonable
no
it
is
not
that
illustrious
for
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
neither
the
codes
nor
the
digest
nor
the
books
of
public
imperial
international
or
natural
law
make
any
mention
of
such
treason
what
i
wanted
to
show
was
that
this
action
subverting
our
planetary
relationships
will
not
only
work
alteration
in
the
order
of
nature
for
it
will
change
the
position
of
things
and
the
ends
for
which
created
beings
now
exist
it
will
also
necessarily
make
a
great
revolution
in
the
science
of
metaphysics
and
everything
connected
with
the
speculative
part
of
knowledge
the
result
will
be
that
men
even
if
they
are
able
and
willing
to
critically
examine
into
the
why
and
wherefore
of
life
will
discover
themselves
and
their
aims
to
be
very
different
from
what
they
are
now
or
from
what
they
imagine
them
to
be
my
dear
child
the
thought
of
these
things
does
not
disturb
me
much
so
little
respect
have
i
for
metaphysics
or
physics
or
even
alchemy
necromancy
or
any
such
things
besides
men
will
in
time
become
content
with
their
position
or
if
they
do
not
like
it
they
may
argue
the
matter
to
their
hearts
content
and
will
doubtless
succeed
in
believing
just
what
they
please
in
this
way
they
may
still
deceive
themselves
under
the
names
of
barons
dukes
emperors
or
anything
else
if
however
they
are
inconsolable
i
confess
it
will
not
give
me
much
uneasiness
well
then
apart
from
men
and
the
earth
consider
illustrious
what
may
reasonably
be
expected
to
happen
in
regard
to
the
other
planets
these
when
they
see
the
earth
reduced
to
their
condition
and
doing
precisely
what
they
do
just
like
one
of
themselves
will
be
jealous
of
its
apparent
superiority
they
will
be
dissatisfied
with
their
own
naked
simplicity
and
sad
loneliness
and
will
desire
to
have
their
rivers
mountains
seas
plants
animals
and
men
for
they
will
see
no
reason
why
they
should
be
in
the
smallest
degree
less
endowed
than
the
earth
thereupon
will
ensue
another
great
revolution
in
the
universe
an
infinite
number
of
new
races
and
people
will
instantaneously
proceed
from
their
soil
like
mushrooms
well
let
them
come
and
the
more
the
merrier
my
light
and
heat
will
suffice
for
them
all
without
any
extra
expense
the
universe
shall
have
food
clothes
and
lodging
amply
provided
gratis
but
if
your
illustrious
lordship
will
reflect
a
moment
yet
another
objection
may
be
discerned
the
stars
having
rivalled
the
earth
will
turn
their
attentions
to
you
they
will
notice
your
fine
throne
noble
court
and
numerous
planetary
satellites
consequently
they
also
will
wish
for
thrones
and
more
they
will
desire
to
rule
as
you
do
over
inferior
planets
each
of
which
must
of
course
be
peopled
and
ornamented
like
the
earth
it
is
needless
to
mention
the
increased
unhappiness
of
the
human
race
their
insignificance
will
be
greater
than
ever
they
will
burst
out
in
all
these
millions
of
new
worlds
so
that
even
the
tiniest
star
of
the
milky
way
will
be
provided
with
its
own
race
of
mortals
now
looking
at
this
solely
as
affecting
your
interests
i
affirm
that
it
will
be
very
prejudicial
hitherto
you
have
been
if
not
the
first
certainly
the
second
in
the
universe
that
is
after
the
earth
nor
have
the
stars
aspired
to
rival
you
in
dignity
in
this
new
state
however
you
will
have
as
many
equals
as
stars
each
with
their
respective
stars
beware
then
lest
this
change
be
ruinous
to
your
supremacy
you
remember
cæsar
remark
when
crossing
the
alps
he
happened
to
pass
a
certain
miserable
little
barbarian
village
he
said
that
he
would
rather
be
the
first
in
that
village
than
the
second
in
rome
similarly
i
would
rather
be
first
in
this
my
own
world
than
second
in
the
universe
but
you
must
not
think
it
is
ambition
that
makes
me
desirous
of
changing
the
present
state
of
things
it
is
solely
my
love
of
peace
or
more
candidly
idleness
therefore
it
is
a
small
matter
to
me
whether
i
am
first
or
last
in
the
universe
unlike
cicero
i
care
more
for
ease
than
dignity
i
also
illustrious
have
striven
my
utmost
to
obtain
this
ease
but
supposing
your
lordship
is
successful
in
your
endeavour
i
doubt
whether
it
will
be
of
long
duration
for
in
the
first
place
i
feel
almost
sure
that
before
many
years
have
elapsed
you
will
be
impelled
to
go
winding
round
and
round
like
a
windlass
or
a
wheel
without
however
varying
your
locality
then
after
a
time
you
will
probably
be
desirous
of
rotating
round
something
the
earth
for
instance
ah
well
be
that
as
it
may
if
you
persist
in
your
determination
i
will
try
to
serve
you
in
spite
of
the
great
difficulties
necessarily
to
be
overcome
if
i
fail
you
must
attribute
the
failure
to
my
inability
not
unwillingness
that
is
well
my
copernicus
do
your
best
there
is
however
yet
another
obstacle
what
is
it
i
fear
lest
i
should
be
burnt
alive
for
my
pains
in
which
case
it
would
be
improbable
that
i
like
the
phoenix
should
rise
from
my
ashes
i
should
therefore
never
see
your
lordship
face
again
listen
copernicus
you
know
that
once
upon
a
time
i
was
a
prophet
when
poetry
ruled
the
world
and
philosophy
was
scarcely
hatched
i
will
now
utter
my
last
prophecy
put
faith
in
me
on
the
strength
of
my
former
power
this
is
what
i
say
it
may
be
that
those
who
come
after
you
and
confirm
your
deeds
shall
be
burnt
or
killed
in
some
other
way
but
you
shall
be
safe
nor
shall
you
suffer
at
all
on
account
of
this
undertaking
and
to
make
your
safety
certain
dedicate
to
the
pope
the
book
you
will
write
on
the
subject
if
you
do
this
i
promise
that
you
will
not
even
lose
your
canonry
footnote
copernicus
did
in
effect
dedicate
his
book
on
the
revolution
of
the
celestial
bodies
the
printing
of
which
was
only
completed
a
few
days
before
his
death
to
pope
paul
iii
the
system
expounded
therein
was
condemned
by
a
decree
of
paul
in
this
condemnation
remained
in
force
until
when
it
was
revoked
by
pius
vii
the
sun
is
supposed
to
be
in
the
centre
and
motionless
the
earth
and
the
rest
of
the
planets
move
round
it
in
elliptical
orbits
the
heavens
and
stars
are
supposed
to
be
stationary
and
their
apparent
diurnal
motion
from

to

is
imputed
to
the

between
an
almanac
seller
and
a
almanacs
new
almanacs
new
calendars
who
wants
new
almanacs
almanacs
for
the
new
year
yes
sir
do
you
think
this
new
year
will
be
a
happy
one
yes
to
be
sure
sir
as
happy
as
last
year
much
more
so
as
the
year
before
still
more
sir
why
should
you
not
like
the
new
year
to
resemble
one
of
the
past
years
no
sir
i
should
not
how
many
years
have
gone
by
since
you
began
to
sell
almanacs
about
twenty
years
sir
which
of
the
twenty
should
you
wish
the
new
year
to
be
like
i
do
not
know
do
you
not
remember
any
particular
year
which
you
thought
a
happy
one
indeed
i
do
not
sir
and
yet
life
is
a
fine
thing
is
it
not
so
they
say
would
you
not
like
to
live
these
twenty
years
and
even
all
your
past
life
from
your
birth
over
again
ah
dear
sir
would
to
god
i
could
but
if
you
had
to
live
over
again
the
life
you
have
already
lived
with
all
its
pleasures
and
sufferings
i
should
not
like
that
then
what
other
life
would
you
like
to
live
mine
or
that
of
the
prince
or
whose
do
you
not
think
that
i
or
the
prince
or
any
one
else
would
reply
exactly
as
you
have
done
and
that
no
one
would
wish
to
repeat
the
same
life
over
again
i
do
believe
that
then
would
you
recommence
it
on
this
condition
if
none
other
were
offered
you
no
sir
indeed
i
would
not
then
what
life
would
you
like
such
an
one
as
god
would
give
me
without
any
conditions
a
life
at
and
of
which
you
would
know
nothing
beforehand
as
you
know
nothing
about
the
new
year
exactly
it
is
what
i
should
wish
had
i
to
live
my
life
over
again
and
so
would
every
one
but
this
proves
that
fate
has
treated
us
all
badly
and
it
is
clear
that
each
person
is
of
opinion
that
the
evil
he
has
experienced
exceeds
the
good
if
no
one
would
wish
to
be
on
condition
of
living
his
own
life
over
again
from
the
beginning
with
just
its
same
proportion
of
good
and
evil
this
life
which
is
such
a
fine
thing
is
not
the
life
we
are
acquainted
with
but
that
of
which
we
know
nothing
it
is
not
the
past
life
but
the
future
with
the
new
year
fate
will
commence
treating
you
and
me
and
every
one
well
and
the
happy
life
will
begin
am
i
not
right
let
us
hope
so
show
me
the
best
almanac
you
have
here
it
is
sir
this
is
worth
thirty
soldi
here
are
thirty
soldi
thank
you
sir
good
day
almanacs
new
almanacs
new
calendars
between
plotinus
and
one
day
when
i
porphyrius
was
meditating
about
taking
my
own
life
plotinus
guessed
my
intention
he
interrupted
me
and
said
that
such
a
design
could
not
proceed
from
a
healthy
mind
but
was
due
to
some
melancholy
indisposition
and
that
i
must
have
change
of
air
ex
of
by
porphyrius
the
same
incident
is
recounted
in
the
life
of
plotinus
by
eunapius
who
adds
that
plotinus
recorded
in
a
book
the
conversation
he
then
held
with
porphyrius
on
the
subject
you
know
porphyrius
how
sincerely
i
am
your
friend
you
will
not
wonder
therefore
that
i
am
unquiet
about
you
for
some
time
i
have
noticed
how
sad
and
thoughtful
you
are
your
expression
of
countenance
is
unusual
and
you
have
let
fall
certain
words
which
make
me
anxious
in
short
i
fear
that
you
contemplate
some
evil
design
how
what
do
you
mean
i
think
you
intend
to
do
yourself
some
injury
it
were
a
bad
omen
to
give
the
deed
its
name
listen
to
me
dear
porphyrius
and
do
not
conceal
the
truth
do
not
wrong
the
friendship
that
has
so
long
existed
between
us
i
know
my
words
will
cause
you
displeasure
and
i
can
easily
understand
that
you
would
rather
have
kept
your
design
hid
but
i
could
not
be
silent
in
such
a
matter
and
you
ought
not
to
refuse
to
confide
in
one
who
loves
you
as
much
as
himself
let
us
then
talk
calmly
weighing
our
words
open
your
heart
to
me
tell
me
your
troubles
and
let
me
be
auditor
of
your
lamentations
i
have
deserved
your
confidence
i
promise
on
my
part
not
to
oppose
the
carrying
out
of
your
resolution
if
we
agree
that
it
is
useful
and
reasonable
i
have
never
denied
a
request
of
yours
dear
plotinus
i
will
therefore
confess
to
you
what
i
would
rather
have
kept
to
myself
nothing
in
the
world
would
induce
me
to
tell
it
to
anyone
else
you
are
right
in
your
interpretation
of
my
thoughts
if
you
wish
to
discuss
the
subject
i
will
not
refuse
in
spite
of
my
dislike
to
do
so
for
on
such
occasions
the
mind
prefers
to
encompass
itself
with
a
lofty
silence
and
to
meditate
in
solitude
giving
itself
up
for
the
time
to
a
state
of
complete
nevertheless
i
am
willing
to
do
as
you
please
in
the
first
place
i
may
say
that
my
design
is
not
the
consequence
of
any
special
misfortune
it
is
simply
the
result
of
an
utter
weariness
of
life
and
a
continuous
ennui
which
has
long
possessed
me
like
a
pain
to
this
may
be
added
a
feeling
of
the
vanity
and
nothingness
of
all
things
which
pervades
me
in
body
and
soul
do
not
say
that
this
disposition
of
mind
is
unreasonable
though
i
will
allow
that
it
may
in
part
proceed
from
physical
causes
it
is
in
itself
perfectly
reasonable
and
therein
differs
from
all
our
other
dispositions
for
everything
which
makes
us
attach
some
value
to
life
and
human
things
proves
on
analysis
to
be
contrary
to
reason
and
to
proceed
from
some
illusion
or
falsity
nothing
is
more
rational
than
ennui
pleasures
are
all
unreal
pain
itself
at
least
mental
pain
is
equally
false
because
on
examination
it
is
seen
to
have
scarcely
any
foundation
or
none
at
all
the
same
may
be
said
of
fear
and
hope
ennui
alone
which
is
born
from
the
vanity
of
things
is
genuine
and
never
deceives
if
then
all
else
be
vain
the
reality
of
life
is
summed
up
in
ennui
it
may
be
so
i
will
not
contradict
you
as
to
that
but
we
must
now
consider
the
nature
of
your
project
you
know
plato
refused
to
allow
that
man
is
at
liberty
to
escape
like
a
fugitive
slave
from
the
captivity
in
which
he
is
placed
by
the
will
of
the
gods
in
depriving
himself
of
life
i
beg
you
dear
plotinus
to
leave
plate
alone
now
with
his
doctrines
and
dreams
it
is
one
thing
to
praise
explain
and
champion
certain
theories
in
the
schools
and
in
books
but
quite
another
to
practically
exemplify
them
and
boots
constrain
us
to
admire
plato
and
conform
to
him
because
such
is
the
custom
in
the
present
day
bat
in
real
life
far
from
being
admired
he
is
even
detested
it
is
true
plato
is
said
to
have
spread
abroad
by
his
writings
the
notion
of
a
future
life
thus
leaving
men
in
doubt
as
to
their
fate
after
death
and
serving
a
good
purpose
in
deterring
men
from
evil
in
this
life
through
fear
of
punishment
in
the
next
if
i
imagined
plato
to
have
been
the
inventor
of
these
ideas
and
beliefs
i
would
speak
thus
to
him
you
observe
o
plato
how
inimical
to
our
race
the
power
which
governs
the
world
has
always
been
whether
known
as
nature
destiny
or
fate
many
reasons
contradict
the
supposition
that
man
has
that
high
rank
in
the
order
of
creation
which
we
are
pleased
to
imagine
but
by
no
reason
can
he
be
deprived
of
the
characteristic
attributed
to
him
by
homer
that
of
suffering
nature
however
has
given
us
a
remedy
for
all
evils
it
is
death
little
feared
by
those
who
are
not
fully
intelligent
and
by
all
others
desired
but
you
have
deprived
us
of
this
dearest
consolation
of
our
life
full
of
suffering
that
it
is
the
doubts
raised
by
you
have
torn
this
comfort
from
our
minds
and
made
the
thought
of
death
the
bitterest
of
all
thoughts
thanks
to
you
unhappy
mortals
now
fear
the
storm
less
than
the
port
driven
from
their
one
place
of
repose
and
robbed
of
the
only
remedy
they
could
look
for
they
resign
themselves
to
the
sufferings
and
troubles
of
life
thus
you
have
been
more
cruel
towards
us
than
destiny
nature
or
fate
and
since
this
doubt
once
conceived
can
never
be
got
rid
of
to
you
is
it
due
that
your
regard
death
as
something
more
terrible
than
life
you
are
to
blame
that
rest
and
peace
are
for
ever
banished
from
the
last
moments
of
man
whereas
all
other
animals
die
in
perfect
fearlessness
this
one
thing
o
plato
was
wanting
to
complete
the
sum
of
human
misery
true
your
intention
was
good
but
it
has
failed
in
its
purpose
violence
and
injustice
are
not
arrested
for
only
realise
the
terrors
of
death
in
their
last
moments
when
quite
powerless
to
do
more
harm
your
doubts
trouble
only
the
good
who
are
more
disposed
to
benefit
than
injure
their
and
the
weak
and
timid
who
are
neither
inclined
by
nature
nor
disposition
to
oppress
anyone
bold
and
strong
men
who
have
scarcely
any
power
of
imagination
and
those
who
require
some
other
restraint
than
mere
law
regard
these
fears
as
chimerical
and
are
undeterred
from
evil
doing
we
see
daily
instances
of
this
and
the
experience
of
all
the
centuries
from
your
time
down
to
the
present
confirms
it
good
laws
still
more
good
education
and
mental
and
social
culture
these
are
the
things
that
preserve
justice
and
mildness
amongst
men
civilisation
and
the
use
of
reflection
and
reason
make
men
almost
always
hate
to
war
with
each
other
and
shed
one
another
blood
and
render
them
disinclined
to
quarrel
and
endanger
their
lives
by
lawlessness
but
such
good
results
are
never
due
to
threatening
fancies
and
bitter
expectation
of
terrible
chastisement
these
like
the
multitude
and
cruelty
of
the
punishments
used
in
certain
states
only
serve
to
increase
the
baseness
and
ferocity
of
men
and
are
therefore
opposed
to
the
of
human
society
perhaps
however
you
will
reply
that
you
have
promised
a
reward
in
the
future
for
the
good
what
then
is
this
reward
a
state
of
life
which
seems
full
of
ennui
even
less
tolerable
than
our
present
existence
the
bitterness
of
your
punishments
is
unmistakable
but
the
sweetness
of
your
rewards
is
hidden
and
secret
incomprehensible
to
our
minds
how
then
can
order
and
virtue
be
said
to
be
encouraged
by
your
doctrine
i
will
venture
to
say
that
if
but
few
men
have
been
deterred
from
evil
by
the
fear
of
your
terrible
tartarus
no
good
man
has
been
led
to
perform
a
single
praiseworthy
action
by
desire
of
your
elysium
such
a
paradise
does
not
attract
us
in
the
least
but
apart
from
the
fact
that
your
heaven
is
scarcely
an
inviting
place
who
among
the
best
of
us
can
hope
to
merit
it
what
man
can
satisfy
your
inexorable
judges
minos
eacus
and
rhadamanthus
who
will
not
overlook
one
single
fault
however
trivial
besides
who
can
say
that
he
has
reached
your
standard
of
purity
in
short
we
can
not
look
for
happiness
in
the
world
to
come
and
however
clear
a
man
conscience
may
be
or
however
upright
his
life
in
his
last
hour
he
will
dread
the
future
with
its
terrible
incertitude
it
is
due
to
your
teaching
that
fear
is
a
much
stronger
influence
than
hope
and
may
be
said
to
dominate
mankind
this
then
is
the
result
of
your
doctrines
man
whose
life
on
earth
is
wretched
in
the
extreme
anticipates
death
not
as
an
end
to
all
his
miseries
but
as
the
beginning
of
a
condition
more
wretched
still
thus
you
surpass
in
cruelty
not
only
nature
and
destiny
but
the
most
merciless
tyrant
and
bloodthirsty
executioner
the
world
has
ever
known
but
what
cruelty
can
exceed
that
of
your
law
forbidding
man
to
put
an
end
to
his
sufferings
and
troubles
by
voluntarily
depriving
himself
of
life
thereby
triumphing
over
the
horrors
of
death
other
animals
do
not
desire
to
put
an
end
to
their
life
because
their
unhappiness
is
less
than
ours
nor
would
they
even
have
sufficient
courage
to
face
a
voluntary
death
but
if
they
did
wish
to
die
what
should
deter
them
from
fulfilling
their
desire
they
are
affected
by
no
prohibition
nor
fear
of
the
future
here
again
you
make
us
inferior
to
brute
beasts
the
liberty
they
possess
they
do
not
use
the
liberty
granted
also
to
us
by
nature
so
miserly
in
her
gifts
you
take
away
thus
the
only
creatures
capable
of
desiring
death
have
the
right
to
die
refused
them
nature
destiny
and
fortune
overwhelm
us
with
cruel
blows
that
cause
us
to
suffer
fearfully
you
add
to
our
sufferings
by
tying
our
arms
and
enchaining
our
feet
so
that
we
can
neither
defend
ourselves
nor
escape
from
our
persecutors
truly
when
i
think
over
the
great
wretchedness
of
humanity
it
seems
to
me
that
your
doctrines
above
all
things
o
plato
are
guilty
of
it
and
that
men
may
well
complain
of
you
more
than
of
nature
for
the
latter
in
decreeing
for
us
an
existence
full
of
unhappiness
has
left
us
the
means
of
escaping
from
it
when
we
please
indeed
unhappiness
can
not
be
called
extreme
when
we
have
in
our
hands
the
power
to
shorten
it
at
will
besides
the
mere
thought
of
being
able
to
quit
life
at
pleasure
and
withdraw
from
the
miseries
of
the
world
is
so
great
an
alleviation
of
our
lot
that
in
itself
it
suffices
to
render
existence
supportable
consequently
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
our
chief
unhappiness
proceeds
from
the
fear
that
in
abbreviating
our
life
we
might
be
plunged
into
a
state
of
greater
misery
than
the
present
and
not
only
will
our
misery
be
greater
in
the
future
but
it
will
be
so
full
of
the
refinement
of
cruelty
that
a
comparison
of
these
unexperienced
tortures
with
the
known
sufferings
of
this
life
reduces
the
latter
almost
to
insignificance
you
have
easily
o
plato
raised
this
question
of
immortality
but
the
human
species
will
become
extinct
before
it
is
settled
your
genius
is
the
most
fatal
thing
that
has
ever
afflicted
humanity
and
nothing
can
ever
exist
more
disastrous
in
its
effects
that
is
what
i
would
say
to
plato
had
he
invented
the
doctrine
we
are
discussing
but
i
am
well
aware
he
did
not
originate
it
however
enough
has
been
said
let
us
drop
the
subject
if
you
please
porphyrius
you
know
how
i
revere
plato
yet
in
talking
to
you
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
i
will
give
you
my
own
opinion
and
will
disregard
his
authority
the
few
words
of
his
that
i
spoke
were
rather
as
an
introduction
than
anything
else
returning
to
my
first
argument
i
affirm
that
not
only
plato
and
every
other
philosopher
but
nature
herself
teaches
us
that
it
is
improper
to
take
away
our
own
life
i
will
not
say
much
on
this
point
because
if
you
reflect
a
little
i
am
sure
you
will
agree
with
me
that
suicide
is
unnatural
it
is
indeed
an
action
the
most
contrary
possible
to
nature
the
whole
order
of
things
would
be
subverted
if
the
beings
of
the
world
destroyed
themselves
and
it
is
repugnant
and
absurd
to
suppose
that
life
is
given
only
to
be
taken
away
by
its
possessor
and
that
beings
should
exist
only
to
become
the
law
of
is
the
strictest
law
of
nature
its
maintenance
is
enjoined
in
every
possible
way
on
man
and
all
creatures
of
the
universe
and
apart
from
anything
else
do
we
not
instinctively
fear
hate
and
shun
death
even
in
spite
of
ourselves
therefore
since
suicide
is
so
utterly
contrary
to
our
nature
i
can
not
think
that
it
is
permissible
i
have
already
meditated
on
the
subject
from
all
points
of
view
for
the
mind
could
not
design
such
a
step
without
due
consideration
it
seems
to
me
that
all
your
reasoning
is
answerable
with
just
as
much
counter
reasoning
but
i
will
be
brief
you
doubt
whether
it
be
permissible
to
die
without
necessity
i
ask
you
if
it
be
permissible
to
be
unhappy
nature
you
say
forbids
suicide
it
is
a
strange
thing
that
since
she
is
either
unable
or
unwilling
to
make
me
happy
or
free
me
from
unhappiness
she
should
have
the
power
to
force
me
to
live
if
nature
has
given
us
a
love
of
life
and
a
hatred
of
death
she
has
also
given
us
a
love
of
happiness
and
a
hatred
of
suffering
and
the
latter
instincts
are
much
more
powerful
than
the
former
because
happiness
is
the
supreme
aim
of
all
our
actions
and
sentiments
of
love
or
hatred
for
to
what
end
do
we
shun
death
or
desire
life
save
to
promote
our
and
for
fear
of
the
contrary
how
then
can
it
be
unnatural
to
escape
from
suffering
in
the
only
way
open
to
man
that
is
by
dying
since
in
life
it
can
never
be
avoided
how
too
can
it
be
true
that
nature
forbids
me
to
devote
myself
to
death
which
is
undoubtedly
a
good
thing
and
to
reject
life
which
is
undoubtedly
an
evil
and
injurious
thing
since
it
is
a
source
of
nothing
but
suffering
to
me
these
things
do
not
persuade
me
that
suicide
is
not
unnatural
have
we
not
a
strong
instinctive
horror
of
death
besides
we
never
see
brute
beasts
which
invariably
follow
the
instincts
of
their
nature
when
not
contrarily
trained
by
man
either
commit
suicide
or
regard
death
as
anything
but
a
condition
to
be
struggled
against
even
in
their
moments
of
greatest
suffering
in
short
all
men
who
commit
this
desperate
act
will
be
found
to
have
lived
out
of
conformity
to
nature
they
on
the
contrary
who
live
naturally
would
without
exception
reject
suicide
if
even
the
thought
proposed
itself
to
them
well
if
you
like
i
will
admit
that
the
action
is
contrary
to
nature
but
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
if
we
ourselves
do
not
conform
to
nature
that
is
are
no
longer
savages
compare
ourselves
for
instance
with
the
inhabitants
of
india
or
ethiopia
who
are
said
to
have
retained
their
primitive
manners
and
wild
habits
you
would
scarcely
think
that
these
people
were
even
of
the
same
species
as
ourselves
this
transformation
of
life
and
change
of
manners
and
customs
by
civilisation
has
been
accompanied
in
my
opinion
by
an
immeasurable
increase
of
suffering
savages
never
wish
to
commit
suicide
nor
does
their
imagination
ever
induce
them
to
regard
death
as
a
desirable
thing
whereas
we
who
are
civilised
wish
for
it
and
sometimes
voluntarily
seek
it
now
if
man
be
permitted
to
live
unnaturally
and
be
consequently
unhappy
why
may
he
not
also
die
unnaturally
for
death
is
indeed
the
only
way
by
which
he
can
deliver
himself
from
the
unhappiness
that
results
from
civilisation
or
why
not
return
to
our
primitive
condition
and
state
of
nature
ah
we
should
find
it
almost
impossible
as
far
as
mere
external
circumstances
are
concerned
and
in
the
more
important
matters
of
the
mind
quite
impossible
what
is
less
natural
than
medicine
by
this
i
mean
surgery
and
the
use
of
drugs
they
are
both
ordinarily
used
expressly
to
combat
nature
and
are
quite
unknown
to
brute
beasts
and
savages
yet
since
the
diseases
they
remedy
are
unnatural
and
only
occur
in
civilised
countries
where
people
have
fallen
from
their
natural
condition
these
arts
being
also
unnatural
are
highly
esteemed
and
even
indispensable
similarly
suicide
which
is
a
radical
cure
for
the
disease
of
despair
one
of
the
outcomes
of
civilisation
must
not
be
blamed
because
it
is
unnatural
for
unnatural
evils
require
unnatural
remedies
it
would
indeed
be
hard
and
unjust
that
reason
which
increases
our
misery
by
forcing
us
to
go
contrary
to
nature
should
in
this
matter
join
hands
with
nature
and
take
from
us
our
only
remaining
hope
and
refuge
and
the
only
resource
consistent
with
itself
and
should
force
us
to
continue
in
our
wretchedness
the
truth
is
this
plotinus
our
primitive
nature
has
departed
from
us
for
ever
habit
and
reason
have
given
us
a
new
nature
in
place
of
the
old
one
to
which
we
shall
never
return
formerly
it
was
unnatural
for
men
to
commit
suicide
or
desire
death
in
the
present
day
both
are
natural
they
conform
to
our
new
nature
which
however
like
the
old
one
still
impels
us
to
seek
our
happiness
and
since
death
is
our
greatest
good
is
it
remarkable
that
men
should
voluntarily
seek
it
for
our
reason
tells
us
that
death
is
not
an
evil
but
as
the
remedy
for
all
evils
is
the
most
desirable
of
things
now
tell
me
are
all
other
actions
of
civilised
men
regulated
by
the
standard
of
their
primitive
nature
if
so
give
me
a
single
instance
no
it
is
our
present
and
not
our
primitive
nature
that
interprets
our
actions
in
other
words
it
is
our
reason
why
then
should
suicide
alone
be
judged
unreasonably
and
from
the
aspect
of
our
primitive
nature
why
should
this
latter
which
has
no
influence
over
our
life
control
our
death
why
should
not
the
same
reason
govern
our
death
which
rules
our
life
it
is
a
fact
whether
due
to
reason
or
our
unhappiness
that
in
many
people
especially
those
who
are
unfortunate
and
afflicted
the
primitive
hatred
of
death
is
extinguished
and
even
changed
into
desire
and
love
as
i
have
said
such
love
though
incompatible
with
our
early
nature
is
a
reality
in
the
present
day
we
are
also
necessarily
unhappy
because
we
live
unnaturally
it
were
therefore
manifestly
unreasonable
to
assert
that
the
prohibition
which
forbade
suicide
in
the
primitive
state
should
now
hold
good
this
seems
to
me
sufficient
justification
of
the
deed
it
remains
to
be
proved
whether
or
not
it
be
useful
never
mind
that
side
of
the
question
my
dear
porphyrius
because
if
the
deed
be
permissible
i
have
no
doubt
of
its
extreme
utility
but
i
will
never
admit
that
a
forbidden
and
improper
action
can
be
useful
the
matter
really
resolves
itself
into
this
which
is
the
better
to
suffer
or
not
to
suffer
it
is
certain
that
most
men
would
prefer
suffering
mixed
with
enjoyment
to
a
state
devoid
of
both
suffering
and
enjoyment
so
ardently
do
we
desire
and
thirst
after
joy
but
this
is
beside
the
question
because
enjoyment
and
pleasure
properly
speaking
are
as
impossible
as
suffering
is
inevitable
i
mean
a
suffering
as
continuous
as
our
never
satisfied
desire
for
pleasure
and
happiness
and
quite
apart
from
the
peculiar
and
accidental
sufferings
which
must
infallibly
be
experienced
by
even
the
happiest
of
men
in
truth
were
we
certain
that
in
continuing
to
live
we
should
continue
thus
to
suffer
we
should
have
sufficient
reason
to
prefer
death
to
life
because
existence
does
not
contain
a
single
genuine
pleasure
to
compensate
for
such
suffering
even
if
that
were
possible
it
seems
to
me
that
ennui
alone
and
the
fact
that
we
can
not
hope
for
an
improved
existence
are
sufficiently
cogent
reasons
to
induce
a
desire
for
death
even
though
our
condition
be
one
of
prosperity
and
it
is
often
a
matter
of
surprise
to
me
that
we
have
no
record
of
princes
having
committed
suicide
through
ennui
and
weariness
of
their
grandeur
like
other
men
in
lower
stations
of
life
we
read
how
hegesias
the
cyrenaic
used
to
reason
so
eloquently
about
the
miseries
of
life
that
his
auditors
straightway
went
and
committed
suicide
for
which
reason
he
was
called
the
death
persuader
and
was
at
length
forbidden
by
ptolemy
to
hold
further
discourse
on
the
subject
certain
princes
it
is
true
have
been
suicides
amongst
others
mithridates
cleopatra
and
otho
but
these
all
put
an
end
to
themselves
to
escape
some
peculiar
evils
or
from
dread
of
an
increase
of
misfortune
princes
are
i
imagine
more
liable
than
other
men
to
feel
a
hatred
of
their
condition
and
to
think
favourably
of
suicide
for
have
they
not
reached
the
summit
of
what
is
called
human
happiness
they
have
nothing
to
hope
for
because
they
have
everything
that
forms
a
part
of
the
good
things
of
this
life
they
can
not
anticipate
greater
pleasure
than
they
have
enjoyed
thus
they
are
more
unfortunately
situated
than
all
less
exalted
people
for
the
present
is
always
sad
and
unsatisfactory
the
future
alone
is
a
source
of
pleasure
but
be
that
as
it
may
we
see
then
that
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
men
voluntarily
quitting
life
and
preferring
death
save
the
fear
of
another
world
all
other
reasons
are
palpably
they
are
due
to
a
wrong
estimate
in
comparing
the
advantages
and
evils
of
existence
and
whoever
at
any
time
feels
a
strong
attachment
to
life
or
lives
in
a
state
of
contentment
does
so
under
a
mistake
either
of
judgment
will
or
even
fact
that
is
true
dear
porphyrius
but
nevertheless
let
me
advise
nay
implore
you
to
listen
to
the
counsels
of
nature
rather
than
reason
follow
the
instincts
of
that
primitive
nature
mother
of
us
all
who
though
she
has
manifested
no
affection
for
us
in
creating
us
for
unhappiness
is
a
less
bitter
and
cruel
foe
than
our
own
reason
with
its
boundless
curiosity
speculation
chattering
dreams
ideas
and
miserable
learning
besides
nature
has
sought
to
diminish
our
unhappiness
by
concealing
or
disguising
it
from
us
as
much
as
possible
and
although
we
are
greatly
changed
and
the
power
of
nature
within
us
is
much
lessened
we
are
not
so
altered
but
that
much
of
our
former
manhood
remains
and
our
primitive
nature
is
not
quite
stifled
within
us
in
spite
of
all
our
folly
it
will
never
be
otherwise
so
too
the
mistaken
view
of
life
that
you
mention
although
i
admit
that
it
is
in
reality
palpably
erroneous
will
continue
to
prevail
it
is
held
not
only
by
idiots
and
the
but
by
clever
wise
and
learned
men
and
always
will
be
unless
the
nature
that
made
us
and
not
man
nor
his
reason
herself
puts
an
end
to
it
and
i
assure
you
that
neither
disgust
of
life
nor
despair
nor
the
sense
of
the
nullity
of
things
the
vanity
of
all
anxiety
and
the
insignificance
of
man
nor
hatred
of
the
world
and
oneself
are
of
long
duration
although
such
dispositions
of
mind
are
perfectly
reasonable
and
the
contrary
unreasonable
for
our
physical
condition
changes
momentarily
in
more
or
less
degree
and
often
without
any
especial
cause
life
endears
itself
to
us
again
and
new
hopes
give
brightness
to
human
things
which
once
more
seem
worthy
of
some
attention
not
indeed
from
our
understanding
but
from
what
may
be
termed
the
higher
senses
of
the
intellect
this
is
why
each
of
us
though
perfectly
aware
of
the
truth
continues
to
live
in
spite
of
reason
and
conforms
to
the
behaviour
of
others
for
our
life
is
controlled
by
these
senses
and
not
by
the
understanding
whether
suicide
be
reasonable
or
our
compromise
with
life
unreasonable
the
former
is
certainly
a
horrible
and
inhuman
action
it
were
better
to
follow
nature
and
remain
man
than
act
like
a
monster
in
following
reason
besides
ought
we
not
to
give
some
thought
to
the
friends
relatives
acquaintance
and
people
with
whom
we
have
been
accustomed
to
live
and
from
whom
we
should
thus
separate
for
ever
and
if
the
thought
of
such
separation
be
nothing
to
us
ought
we
not
to
consider
their
feelings
they
lose
one
whom
they
loved
and
respected
and
the
atrocity
of
his
death
enhances
their
grief
i
know
that
the
wise
man
is
not
easily
moved
nor
yields
to
pity
and
lamentation
to
a
disquieting
extent
he
does
not
abase
himself
to
the
ground
shed
tears
immoderately
nor
do
other
similar
things
unworthy
of
one
who
clearly
understands
the
condition
of
humanity
but
such
fortitude
of
soul
should
be
reserved
for
grievous
circumstances
that
arise
from
nature
or
are
unavoidable
it
is
an
abuse
of
fortitude
to
deprive
ourselves
for
ever
of
the
society
and
conversation
of
those
who
are
dear
to
us
he
is
a
barbarian
and
not
a
wise
man
who
takes
no
account
of
the
grief
experienced
by
his
friends
relations
and
acquaintances
he
who
scarcely
troubles
himself
about
the
grief
his
death
would
cause
to
his
friends
and
family
is
selfish
he
cares
little
for
others
and
all
for
himself
and
truly
the
suicide
thinks
only
of
himself
he
desires
nought
but
his
personal
welfare
and
throws
away
all
thought
of
the
rest
of
the
world
in
short
suicide
is
an
action
of
the
most
unqualified
and
sordid
egotism
and
is
certainly
the
least
attractive
form
of
that
exists
in
the
world
finally
my
dear
porphyrius
the
troubles
and
evils
of
life
although
many
and
inevitable
when
as
in
your
case
unaccompanied
by
grievous
calamity
or
bodily
infirmity
are
after
all
easy
to
be
borne
especially
by
a
wise
and
strong
man
like
yourself
and
indeed
life
itself
is
of
so
little
importance
that
man
ought
not
to
trouble
himself
much
either
to
retain
or
abandon
it
and
without
thinking
greatly
about
it
we
ought
to
give
the
former
instinct
precedence
over
the
latter
if
a
friend
begged
you
to
do
this
why
should
you
not
gratify
him
now
i
earnestly
entreat
you
dear
porphyrius
by
the
memory
of
our
long
friendship
put
away
this
idea
do
not
grieve
your
friends
who
love
you
with
such
warm
affection
and
your
plotinus
who
has
no
dearer
nor
better
friend
in
the
world
help
us
to
bear
the
burden
of
life
instead
of
leaving
us
without
a
thought
let
us
live
dear
porphyrius
and
console
each
other
let
us
not
refuse
our
share
of
the
sufferings
of
humanity
apportioned
to
us
by
destiny
let
us
cling
to
each
other
with
mutual
encouragement
and
hand
in
hand
strengthen
one
another
better
to
bear
the
troubles
of
life
our
time
after
all
will
be
short
and
when
death
comes
we
will
not
complain
in
the
last
hour
our
friends
and
companions
will
comfort
us
and
we
shall
be
gladdened
by
the
thought
that
after
death
we
shall
still
live
in
their
memory
and
be
loved
by
them

a
pupil

like
him
established
a
school
of

at

from
study
of
the
writings
of

he
fell
into
a
state
of
disgust
with

retiring
from

lived
alone
in
a
solitary
and
wild
part

he
determined
to
put

by

he
was
found
by

who
had
followed
him
from
rome
in
a
state
of
extreme
weakness
and
was
by
his
wise
counsels
dissuaded
from
completing
his
intention
of
the
last
words
of
marcus
brutus
and
i
think
in
all
ancient
history
there
can
be
found
no
words
more
lamentable
and
terrifying
yet
withal
speaking
humanly
more
true
than
those
uttered
by
marcus
brutus
shortly
before
death
in
disparagement
of
virtue
this
is
what
according
to
dionysius
cassius
he
is
reported
to
have
said
o
miserable
virtue
thou
art
but
a
mere
phrase
and
i
have
followed
thee
as
though
thou
wert
a
reality
fate
is
stronger
than
thee
plutarch
in
his
life
of
brutus
makes
no
mention
of
this
which
has
induced
pier
vettori
to
conclude
that
cassius
has
here
taken
licence
in
prose
often
accorded
to
poetry
but
its
truth
is
confirmed
by
the
witness
of
florus
who
states
that
brutus
when
at
the
point
of
death
exclaimed
that
virtue
was
an
expression
and
not
a
reality
many
people
are
shocked
at
those
words
of
brutus
and
blame
him
for
uttering
them
they
infer
from
their
meaning
either
that
virtue
is
a
sealed
book
to
them
or
else
that
they
have
never
experienced
the
former
inference
alone
is
credible
in
any
case
it
is
certain
they
but
slightly
understand
and
still
less
realise
the
unhappiness
of
human
affairs
or
else
they
stupidly
wonder
why
the
doctrines
of
christianity
were
not
in
force
before
the
time
of
christ
other
people
interpret
these
words
as
demonstrating
that
brutus
was
not
after
all
the
noble
and
pious
man
he
was
supposed
to
have
been
they
imagine
that
just
before
death
he
threw
off
the
mask
but
they
are
wrong
and
if
they
give
brutus
credit
for
sincerity
in
uttering
these
words
in
repudiation
of
virtue
let
them
consider
how
it
were
possible
for
him
to
abandon
what
he
never
possessed
or
to
disassociate
himself
from
that
with
which
he
never
had
any
association
if
they
think
he
was
insincere
and
spoke
designedly
and
with
ostentation
let
them
explain
what
object
he
could
have
in
speaking
vain
and
fallacious
words
and
immediately
afterwards
acting
in
accordance
with
them
are
facts
deniable
simply
because
they
are
not
in
harmony
with
words
brutus
was
a
man
overwhelmed
by
a
great
and
unavoidable
catastrophe
he
was
disheartened
and
wearied
with
life
and
fortune
and
having
abandoned
all
desires
and
hopes
the
deceitfulness
of
which
he
had
experienced
he
determined
to
take
his
destiny
into
his
own
hands
and
to
put
an
end
to
his
unhappiness
why
should
he
at
the
very
moment
of
eternal
separation
from
his
fellows
trouble
to
hunt
the
phantom
of
glory
and
study
to
give
forth
words
and
thoughts
to
deceive
those
around
him
and
to
gain
human
esteem
when
he
was
about
to
leave
humanity
for
ever
what
was
it
to
him
that
he
might
gain
a
reputation
on
that
earth
which
appeared
so
hateful
and
contemptible
to
him
these
words
of
brutus
are
well
known
to
most
of
us
the
following
utterance
of
theophrastus
at
the
point
of
death
is
i
believe
less
known
though
very
worthy
of
consideration
it
forms
a
parallel
with
that
of
brutus
both
as
to
its
substance
and
time
of
delivery
diogenes
laertius
mentions
it
not
in
my
opinion
as
original
to
himself
but
as
an
extract
from
some
more
ancient
and
important
work
he
says
that
theophrastus
just
before
death
being
asked
by
his
disciples
whether
he
would
leave
them
any
token
or
words
of
advice
replied
none
except
that
man
despises
and
rejects
many
pleasures
for
the
sake
of
glory
but
no
sooner
does
he
begin
to
live
than
death
overtakes
him
hence
the
love
of
glory
is
as
fatal
a
thing
as
possible
strive
to
live
happily
abandon
studies
which
are
a
weariness
or
cultivate
them
only
so
that
they
may
bring
you
fame
life
is
more
vain
than
useful
as
for
me
i
have
no
time
to
think
more
about
it
you
must
study
what
is
most
expedient
so
saying
he
died
other
sayings
of
theophrastus
on
this
occasion
are
mentioned
by
cicero
and
jerome
these
are
better
known
but
have
nothing
to
do
with
our
subject
it
would
seem
that
theophrastus
lived
to
the
age
of
more
than
a
hundred
having
devoted
all
his
lifetime
to
study
and
writing
and
having
been
an
unwearied
pursuer
of
glory
suidas
says
that
his
death
was
due
to
the
excess
of
his
studies
and
that
he
died
surrounded
by
about
two
thousand
of
his
disciples
and
followers
reverenced
for
his
wisdom
throughout
the
whole
of
greece
regretting
his
pursuit
of
glory
just
as
brutus
repented
of
virtue
these
two
words
glory
and
virtue
were
by
the
ancients
regarded
as
almost
synonymous
in
meaning
though
it
is
not
so
in
the
present
day
theophrastus
did
not
indeed
say
that
glory
is
more
frequently
a
matter
of
fortune
than
merit
which
is
oftener
true
now
than
in
former
times
but
had
he
said
so
there
would
have
been
no
difference
between
his
idea
and
that
of
brutus
such
abjurations
or
rather
apostasies
of
those
noble
errors
which
beautify
nay
compose
our
very
life
are
of
daily
occurrence
they
are
due
to
the
fact
that
the
human
intelligence
in
process
of
time
discovers
not
only
the
nakedness
but
even
the
skeleton
of
things
wisdom
also
which
was
regarded
by
the
ancients
as
the
consolation
and
chief
cure
for
our
unhappiness
has
been
obliged
to
impeach
our
condition
and
almost
requires
a
consolation
for
itself
since
had
not
men
followed
it
they
would
not
have
known
the
greatness
of
their
misfortune
or
at
least
would
have
been
able
to
remedy
it
with
hope
but
the
ancients
used
to
believe
according
to
the
teaching
of
nature
that
things
were
things
and
not
appearances
and
that
human
life
was
destined
to
partake
of
happiness
as
well
as
unhappiness
consequently
such
apostasies
as
these
were
very
rare
and
were
the
result
not
of
passions
and
vices
but
of
a
sentiment
and
realisation
of
the
truth
of
things
therefore
they
deserve
careful
and
philosophical
consideration
the
words
of
theophrastus
are
the
more
surprising
when
we
think
of
the
circumstances
in
which
he
died
he
was
prosperous
and
successful
and
it
would
seem
as
though
he
could
not
have
a
single
cause
for
regret
his
chief
aim
glory
he
had
succeeded
in
acquiring
long
ago
the
utterance
of
brutus
on
the
other
hand
was
one
of
those
inspirations
of
misfortune
which
sometimes
open
out
a
new
world
to
our
minds
and
persuade
us
of
truths
that
require
a
long
time
for
the
mere
intelligence
to
discover
misfortune
may
indeed
be
compared
in
its
effect
to
the
frenzy
of
lyric
poets
who
at
a
glance
as
if
situated
in
a
lofty
place
take
in
as
much
of
the
domain
of
human
knowledge
as
requires
many
centuries
before
it
be
discerned
by
philosophers
in
almost
all
ancient
writings
whether
philosophical
poetical
historical
or
aught
else
we
meet
with
many
very
sorrowful
expressions
common
enough
to
us
nowadays
but
strange
to
the
people
of
those
times
these
sentences
however
were
mostly
due
to
the
innate
or
accidental
misfortune
of
the
writer
or
the
persons
who
spoke
them
whether
imaginary
or
real
and
rarely
we
find
on
the
monuments
of
the
ancients
any
expression
of
the
sadness
or
ennui
which
they
felt
because
of
the
unreality
of
happiness
or
their
misfortunes
whether
natural
or
due
to
force
of
circumstances
for
when
they
suffered
they
lamented
their
sufferings
as
the
only
hindrance
to
their
happiness
which
they
not
only
considered
it
possible
to
obtain
but
even
man
right
although
fate
proved
sometimes
too
strong
now
let
us
seek
what
could
have
placed
in
the
mind
of
theophrastus
this
sentiment
about
the
vanity
of
glory
and
life
which
considering
his
epoch
and
nation
is
an
extraordinary
one
in
the
first
place
we
find
that
the
studies
of
this
philosopher
were
not
limited
to
one
or
two
branches
of
science
the
record
of
his
writings
which
are
mostly
lost
informs
us
that
his
knowledge
included
little
less
than
everything
then
knowable
and
this
universal
science
was
not
like
that
of
plato
subordinated
to
his
imagination
but
conformed
to
the
teaching
of
aristotle
in
being
the
result
of
experience
and
reason
its
aim
too
was
not
the
discovery
of
the
beautiful
but
that
which
is
its
especial
contrary
the
useful
this
being
so
it
is
not
wonderful
that
theophrastus
should
attain
to
the
height
of
human
wisdom
that
is
a
knowledge
of
the
vanity
of
life
and
wisdom
itself
for
it
is
a
fact
that
the
numerous
discoveries
made
recently
by
philosophers
about
the
nature
of
men
and
things
are
chiefly
the
result
of
a
comparison
and
synthesis
of
the
different
sciences
and
studies
whereby
the
mutual
connection
between
the
most
distant
parts
of
nature
is
demonstrated
besides
from
his
book
of
characters
we
learn
how
clearly
theophrastus
discerned
the
qualities
and
manners
of
men
indeed
with
the
exception
of
the
poets
very
few
ancient
writers
equal
him
in
this
respect
and
this
faculty
is
the
sure
sign
of
a
mind
capable
of
numerous
diverse
and
powerful
sensations
for
to
produce
a
keen
representation
of
the
moral
qualities
and
passions
of
men
the
writer
relies
less
on
what
actual
facts
he
may
have
collected
or
observations
made
about
the
manners
of
others
than
on
his
own
mind
even
though
his
personal
habits
be
very
different
from
those
of
his
subjects
massillon
was
asked
one
day
what
enabled
him
to
describe
so
naturally
the
habits
and
feelings
of
men
who
like
himself
lived
more
in
solitude
than
society
he
replied
i
contemplate
myself
dramatists
and
other
poets
do
the
same
thing
now
a
mind
subtle
in
discernment
can
not
but
feel
the
nakedness
and
absolute
unhappiness
of
life
it
acquires
a
tendency
to
sadness
after
meditation
excited
by
numerous
studies
especially
such
as
are
concerned
with
the
very
essence
of
things
like
the
speculative
sciences
it
is
certain
that
theophrastus
who
loved
study
and
glory
above
everything
and
was
master
or
rather
founder
of
a
very
numerous
school
knew
and
formally
announced
the
uselessness
of
human
exertions
including
his
own
teaching
and
that
of
others
the
little
affinity
existing
between
virtue
and
happiness
of
life
and
the
superior
power
of
fortune
to
merit
in
the
acquirement
of
happiness
equally
among
the
wise
and
others
in
this
respect
perhaps
he
was
superior
to
all
the
greek
philosophers
especially
those
preceding
epicurus
from
whom
both
in
manners
and
thought
he
was
essentially
different
this
is
owing
partly
to
circumstances
already
mentioned
and
is
also
due
to
other
things
referred
to
by
ancient
writers
on
the
subject
of
his
teaching
it
would
seem
as
though
his
own
fate
has
proved
the
truth
of
his
doctrine
for
he
is
not
esteemed
by
modern
philosophers
as
he
ought
to
be
since
all
his
moral
writings
are
lost
with
the
exception
of
his
characters
his
writings
too
on
the
subjects
of
politics
and
laws
and
almost
all
those
relating
to
metaphysics
are
also
missing
besides
the
ancient
philosophers
were
little
inclined
to
give
him
credit
for
keener
perception
than
they
possessed
on
the
contrary
many
of
them
especially
such
as
were
shallow
and
conceited
blamed
and
him
these
men
taught
that
the
wise
man
is
essentially
happy
and
that
virtue
and
wisdom
suffice
to
procure
happiness
although
they
were
only
too
well
aware
of
the
contrary
even
supposing
they
had
any
real
knowledge
of
either
the
one
or
the
other
philosophers
will
never
be
cured
of
this
idea
even
the
philosophy
of
the
present
day
teaches
the
same
thing
whereas
correctly
speaking
it
can
only
say
that
everything
beautiful
delightful
and
great
is
mere
falsity
and
nothingness
but
to
return
to
theophrastus
most
of
the
ancients
were
incapable
of
the
profound
and
sorrowful
sentiment
that
inspired
him
theophrastus
is
roughly
handled
by
all
the
philosophers
in
their
writings
and
schools
for
having
praised
this
saying
of
callisthenes
not
wisdom
is
the
mistress
of
life
they
consider
that
no
philosopher
ever
gave
expression
to
a
weaker
sentiment
so
says
cicero
who
in
another
place
remarks
that
theophrastus
in
his
book
about
the
happy
life
attributed
much
influence
to
fortune
which
he
considered
a
most
important
factor
of
happiness
again
he
adds
let
us
make
much
use
of
theophrastus
but
give
virtue
more
reality
and
value
than
he
gave
to
it
perhaps
it
may
be
imagined
from
these
remarks
that
theophrastus
had
little
sympathy
with
the
weaknesses
of
human
nature
and
that
he
waged
war
against
their
influence
in
public
and
private
life
both
by
his
writings
and
actions
it
might
also
be
thought
that
he
would
restrict
the
empire
of
the
imagination
in
favour
of
that
of
reason
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
did
just
the
contrary
concerning
his
actions
we
read
in
plutarch
book
against
colotes
that
our
philosopher
twice
freed
his
country
from
a
tyranny
as
for
his
teachings
cicero
says
that
theophrastus
in
a
writing
on
the
subject
of
wealth
dilated
at
considerable
length
on
the
advantages
of
magnificence
and
pomp
at
the
shows
and
national
festivals
indeed
he
considered
the
chief
usefulness
of
riches
to
lie
in
the
consequent
power
of
expenditure
that
accompanied
them
this
idea
is
blamed
and
ridiculed
by
cicero
with
whom
however
i
will
not
discuss
the
question
for
his
superficial
knowledge
of
philosophy
might
have
easily
led
him
to
a
wrong
conclusion
i
imagine
cicero
to
have
been
a
man
rich
in
civil
and
domestic
virtues
but
ignorant
of
the
greatest
stimulants
and
bulwarks
of
virtue
that
the
world
possesses
namely
those
things
that
are
peculiarly
adapted
to
excite
and
arouse
the
mind
and
exercise
the
powers
of
the
imagination
i
will
merely
say
that
those
men
among
the
ancients
and
moderns
who
knew
best
and
realised
most
strongly
and
deeply
the
nullity
of
everything
and
the
force
of
truth
have
not
only
refrained
from
endeavouring
to
lead
others
to
their
condition
but
have
even
laboured
hard
to
conceal
and
disguise
it
from
themselves
they
acted
like
men
who
had
learnt
from
experience
the
wretchedness
that
resulted
from
wisdom
and
knowledge
many
celebrated
examples
of
this
are
furnished
especially
in
recent
times
truly
if
our
philosophers
fully
understood
what
they
endeavour
to
teach
and
realised
in
their
own
persons
the
consequences
of
their
philosophy
instead
of
welcoming
their
knowledge
they
would
hate
and
abhor
it
they
would
strive
to
forget
what
they
know
and
to
shut
their
eyes
to
that
which
they
see
they
would
take
refuge
as
their
best
resource
in
those
sweet
unrealities
which
nature
herself
has
placed
in
all
our
minds
nor
would
they
think
it
well
to
enforce
on
others
the
doctrine
of
the
nothingness
of
all
things
if
however
desire
of
glory
should
incite
them
to
do
this
last
they
will
admit
that
in
this
part
of
the
universe
we
can
only
live
by
putting
faith
in
things
that
are
there
is
another
considerable
difference
between
the
circumstances
of
theophrastus
and
brutus
that
of
time
when
theophrastus
lived
the
influence
of
those
fictions
and
phantoms
which
ruled
the
thoughts
and
actions
of
the
ancients
had
not
departed
the
epoch
of
brutus
on
the
other
hand
may
be
termed
the
last
age
of
the
imagination
knowledge
and
experience
of
the
truth
prevailed
amongst
the
people
had
it
not
been
so
brutus
need
not
have
fled
from
life
as
he
did
and
the
roman
republic
would
not
have
died
with
him
and
not
only
the
republic
but
also
the
whole
of
antiquity
that
is
the
old
customs
and
characteristics
of
the
civilised
world
were
at
the
point
of
death
together
with
the
opinions
which
gave
birth
to
and
supported
them
life
had
already
lost
its
value
and
wise
men
sought
to
console
themselves
not
so
much
for
their
fate
as
for
existence
itself
because
they
regarded
it
as
incredible
that
man
should
be
born
essentially
and
solely
for
misery
thus
they
arrived
at
the
conception
of
another
life
which
might
explain
the
reason
of
virtue
and
noble
actions
such
explanation
had
hitherto
been
found
in
life
itself
but
was
so
no
longer
nor
was
it
ever
again
to
be
found
there
to
these
ideas
of
futurity
are
due
the
noble
sentiments
often
expressed
by
cicero
especially
in
his
oration
for
archias
between
tristano
and
a
i
have
read
your
book
it
is
as
melancholy
as
usual
yes
as
usual
melancholy
disconsolate
hopeless
it
is
clear
that
this
life
appears
to
you
an
abominable
thing
how
can
i
excuse
myself
i
was
then
so
firmly
convinced
of
the
truth
of
my
notion
about
the
unhappiness
of
life
unhappy
it
may
be
but
even
then
what
good
no
no
on
the
contrary
it
is
very
happy
i
have
changed
my
opinion
now
but
when
i
wrote
this
book
i
had
that
folly
in
my
head
as
i
tell
you
and
i
was
so
full
of
it
that
i
should
have
expected
anything
rather
than
to
doubt
the
truth
of
what
i
wrote
on
the
subject
for
i
thought
the
conscience
of
every
reader
would
assuredly
bear
witness
to
the
truth
of
my
statements
i
imagined
there
might
be
differences
of
opinion
as
to
the
use
or
harm
of
my
writings
but
none
as
to
their
truth
i
also
believed
that
my
lamentations
since
they
were
aroused
by
misfortunes
common
to
all
would
be
echoed
in
the
heart
of
every
one
who
heard
them
and
when
i
afterwards
felt
impelled
to
deny
not
merely
some
particular
observation
but
the
whole
fabric
of
my
book
and
to
say
that
life
is
not
unhappy
and
that
if
it
seemed
so
to
me
it
must
have
been
the
effect
of
illness
or
some
other
misfortune
peculiar
to
myself
i
was
at
first
amazed
astonished
petrified
and
for
several
days
as
though
transported
into
another
world
then
i
began
to
think
and
was
a
little
irritated
with
myself
finally
i
laughed
and
said
to
myself
that
the
human
race
possesses
a
characteristic
common
to
husbands
for
a
married
man
who
wishes
to
live
a
quiet
life
relies
on
the
fidelity
of
his
wife
even
when
half
the
world
knows
she
is
faithless
similarly
when
a
man
takes
up
his
abode
in
any
country
he
makes
up
his
mind
to
regard
it
as
one
of
the
best
countries
in
the
world
and
he
does
so
for
the
same
reason
men
desiring
to
live
agree
to
consider
life
a
delightful
and
valuable
thing
they
therefore
believe
it
to
be
so
and
are
angry
with
whoever
is
of
the
contrary
opinion
hence
it
follows
that
in
reality
people
always
believe
not
the
truth
but
what
is
or
appears
to
be
best
for
them
the
human
race
which
has
believed
and
will
continue
to
put
faith
in
so
many
absurdities
will
never
acknowledge
that
it
knows
nothing
that
it
is
nothing
and
that
it
has
nothing
to
hope
no
philosopher
teaching
any
one
of
these
three
things
would
be
successful
nor
would
he
have
followers
and
the
populace
especially
would
refuse
to
believe
in
him
for
apart
from
the
fact
that
all
three
doctrines
have
little
to
recommend
them
to
any
one
who
wishes
to
live
the
two
first
offend
man
pride
and
they
all
require
courage
and
strength
of
mind
in
him
who
accepts
them
now
men
are
cowards
of
ignoble
and
narrow
minds
and
always
anticipating
good
because
always
ready
to
vary
their
ideas
of
good
according
to
the
necessities
of
life
they
are
very
willing
as
petrarch
says
to
surrender
to
fortune
very
eager
and
determined
to
console
themselves
in
any
misfortune
and
to
accept
any
compensation
in
exchange
for
what
is
denied
them
or
for
that
which
they
have
lost
and
to
accommodate
themselves
to
any
condition
of
life
however
wicked
and
barbarous
when
deprived
of
any
desirable
thing
they
nourish
themselves
on
illusions
from
which
they
derive
as
much
satisfaction
as
if
their
conceptions
were
the
most
genuine
and
real
things
in
the
world
as
for
me
i
can
not
refrain
from
laughing
at
the
human
race
enamoured
of
life
just
as
the
people
in
the
south
of
europe
laugh
at
husbands
enamoured
of
faithless
wives
i
consider
men
show
very
little
courage
in
thus
allowing
themselves
to
be
deceived
and
deluded
like
fools
they
are
not
only
content
to
bear
the
greatest
sufferings
but
also
are
willing
to
be
as
it
were
puppets
of
nature
and
destiny
i
here
refer
to
the
deceptions
of
the
intellect
not
the
imagination
whether
these
sentiments
of
mine
are
the
result
of
illness
i
do
not
know
but
i
do
know
that
well
or
ill
i
despise
men
cowardice
i
reject
every
childish
consolation
and
illusive
comfort
and
am
courageous
enough
to
bear
the
deprivation
of
every
hope
to
look
steadily
on
the
desert
of
life
to
hide
no
part
of
our
unhappiness
and
to
accept
all
the
consequences
of
a
philosophy
sorrowful
but
true
this
philosophy
if
of
no
other
use
gives
the
courageous
man
the
proud
satisfaction
of
being
able
to
rend
asunder
the
cloak
that
conceals
the
hidden
and
mysterious
cruelty
of
human
destiny
this
i
said
to
myself
almost
as
though
i
were
the
inventor
of
this
bitter
philosophy
which
i
saw
rejected
by
every
one
as
a
new
and
thing
but
on
reflection
i
found
that
it
dated
from
the
time
of
solomon
homer
and
the
most
ancient
poets
and
philosophers
who
abound
with
fables
and
sayings
which
express
the
unhappiness
of
human
life
one
says
that
man
is
the
most
miserable
of
the
animals
another
that
it
were
better
not
to
be
born
or
being
born
to
die
in
the
cradle
again
whom
the
gods
love
die
young
besides
numberless
other
similar
sayings
and
i
also
remembered
that
from
then
even
until
now
all
poets
philosophers
and
writers
great
and
small
have
in
one
way
or
another
echoed
and
confirmed
the
same
doctrines
then
i
began
to
think
again
and
spent
a
long
time
in
a
state
of
wonder
contempt
and
laughter
at
length
i
turned
to
study
the
matter
more
deeply
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
man
unhappiness
is
one
of
the
innate
errors
of
the
mind
and
that
the
refutation
of
this
idea
through
the
demonstration
of
the
happiness
of
life
is
one
of
the
greatest
discoveries
of
the
nineteenth
century
now
therefore
i
am
at
peace
and
confess
i
was
wrong
to
hold
the
views
i
previously
held
then
have
you
changed
your
opinion
of
course
do
you
imagine
i
should
oppose
the
discoveries
of
the
nineteenth
century
do
you
believe
all
the
century
believes
certainly
why
not
you
believe
then
in
the
infinite
perfectibility
of
the
human
race
do
you
not
undoubtedly
do
you
also
believe
that
the
human
race
actually
progresses
daily
assuredly
it
is
true
that
sometimes
i
think
one
of
the
ancients
was
physically
worth
four
of
us
and
the
body
is
the
man
because
apart
from
all
else
courage
the
passions
capacity
for
action
and
enjoyment
and
all
that
ennobles
and
vivifies
life
depend
on
the
vigour
of
the
body
without
which
they
can
not
exist
the
weak
man
is
not
a
man
but
a
child
and
less
than
a
child
because
it
is
his
fate
to
stand
aside
and
see
others
live
all
he
can
do
is
to
chatter
life
is
not
for
him
hence
in
olden
times
and
even
in
more
enlightened
ages
weakness
of
body
was
regarded
as
ignominious
but
with
us
it
is
very
long
since
education
deigned
to
think
of
such
a
base
and
abject
thing
as
the
body
the
mind
is
its
sole
care
yet
in
its
endeavours
to
cultivate
the
mind
it
destroys
the
body
without
perceiving
that
the
former
is
also
necessarily
destroyed
and
even
if
it
were
possible
to
remedy
this
false
system
of
education
it
would
be
impossible
to
discover
without
a
radical
change
in
the
state
of
modern
society
any
cure
for
the
other
inconveniences
of
life
whether
public
or
private
everything
that
formerly
tended
to
preserve
and
perfect
the
body
seems
to
be
in
conspiracy
for
its
destruction
the
consequence
is
that
compared
with
the
ancients
we
are
little
better
than
children
and
they
in
comparison
with
us
may
indeed
be
termed
perfect
men
i
refer
equally
to
individuals
in
comparison
with
individuals
as
to
the
masses
to
use
this
most
expressive
modern
term
compared
to
the
masses
i
will
add
also
that
the
superior
vigour
of
the
ancients
is
manifested
in
their
moral
and
metaphysical
systems
but
i
do
not
allow
myself
to
be
influenced
by
such
trifling
objections
and
i
firmly
believe
that
the
human
race
is
perpetually
in
a
state
of
progression
you
believe
also
if
i
rightly
understand
you
that
knowledge
or
as
it
is
called
enlightenment
continually
increases
assuredly
although
i
observe
that
the
desire
of
knowledge
grows
in
proportion
as
the
appreciation
for
study
diminishes
and
astonishing
to
say
if
you
count
up
the
number
of
truly
learned
men
who
lived
contemporaneously
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
or
even
later
you
will
find
them
incomparably
more
numerous
than
at
present
it
may
perhaps
be
said
that
learned
people
are
rare
nowadays
because
knowledge
is
more
universally
disseminated
instead
of
being
confined
to
the
heads
of
a
few
and
that
the
multitude
of
educated
people
compensate
for
the
rarity
of
learned
people
but
knowledge
is
not
like
riches
which
whether
divided
or
accumulated
always
make
the
same
total
in
a
country
where
every
one
knows
a
little
the
total
knowledge
is
small
because
knowledge
begets
knowledge
but
will
not
bear
dispersion
for
superficial
instruction
can
not
indeed
be
divided
amongst
many
though
it
may
be
common
to
many
unlearned
men
genuine
knowledge
belongs
only
to
the
learned
and
depth
in
knowledge
to
the
few
that
are
very
learned
and
with
rare
exceptions
only
the
man
who
is
very
learned
and
possessed
of
an
immense
fund
of
knowledge
is
able
to
add
materially
to
the
sum
of
human
science
now
in
the
present
time
it
is
daily
more
difficult
to
discover
a
really
learned
man
save
perhaps
in
germany
where
science
is
not
yet
dethroned
i
utter
these
reflections
simply
for
the
sake
of
a
little
talk
and
philosophising
not
because
i
doubt
for
a
single
moment
the
truth
of
what
you
say
indeed
were
i
to
see
the
world
quite
full
of
ignorant
impostors
on
the
one
hand
and
presumptuous
fools
on
the
other
i
should
still
hold
to
my
present
belief
that
knowledge
and
enlightenment
are
on
the
increase
of
course
then
you
believe
that
this
century
is
superior
to
all
the
preceding
ones
decidedly
all
the
centuries
have
had
this
opinion
of
themselves
even
those
of
the
most
barbarous
ages
the
present
century
thinks
so
and
i
agree
with
it
but
if
you
asked
me
in
what
it
is
superior
to
the
others
and
whether
in
things
pertaining
to
the
body
or
the
mind
i
should
refer
you
to
what
i
said
just
now
on
the
subject
of
progress
in
short
to
sum
it
up
in
two
words
do
you
agree
with
what
the
journals
say
about
nature
and
human
destiny
we
are
not
now
talking
of
literature
or
politics
on
which
subjects
their
opinion
is
indisputable
precisely
i
bow
before
the
profound
philosophy
of
the
journals
which
will
in
time
supersede
every
other
branch
of
literature
and
every
serious
and
exacting
study
the
journals
are
the
guides
and
lights
of
the
present
age
is
it
not
so
very
true
unless
you
are
speaking
ironically
you
have
become
one
of
us
yes
certainly
i
have
then
what
shall
you
do
with
your
book
will
you
allow
it
to
go
down
to
posterity
conveying
doctrines
so
contrary
to
the
opinions
you
now
hold
to
posterity
permit
me
to
laugh
since
you
are
no
doubt
joking
if
i
thought
otherwise
i
should
laugh
all
the
more
for
it
is
not
a
personal
matter
but
one
relating
to
the
individuals
and
individual
things
of
the
nineteenth
century
about
whom
and
which
there
is
no
fear
of
the
judgment
of
posterity
since
they
will
know
no
more
about
the
matter
than
their
ancestors
knew
individuals
are
eclipsed
in
the
crowd
as
our
modern
thinkers
elegantly
say
which
means
that
the
individual
need
not
put
himself
to
any
inconvenience
because
whatever
his
merit
he
can
neither
hope
for
the
miserable
reward
of
glory
in
reality
nor
in
his
dreams
leave
therefore
the
masses
to
themselves
although
i
would
ask
the
wiseacres
who
illumine
the
world
in
the
present
day
to
explain
how
the
masses
can
do
anything
without
the
help
of
the
individuals
that
compose
them
but
to
return
to
my
book
and
posterity
books
now
are
generally
written
in
less
time
than
is
necessary
for
reading
them
their
worth
is
proportioned
to
their
cost
and
their
longevity
to
their
value
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
twentieth
century
will
make
a
very
clean
sweep
of
the
immense
bibliography
of
the
nineteenth
perhaps
however
it
will
say
something
to
this
effect
we
have
here
whole
libraries
of
books
which
have
cost
some
twenty
some
thirty
years
of
labour
and
some
less
but
all
have
required
very
great
exertion
let
us
read
these
first
because
it
is
probable
there
is
much
to
be
learnt
from
them
these
at
an
end
we
will
pass
to
lighter
literature
my
friend
this
is
a
puerile
age
and
the
few
men
remaining
are
obliged
to
hide
themselves
for
very
shame
resembling
as
they
do
a
man
in
a
land
of
cripples
and
these
good
youths
of
the
century
are
desirous
of
doing
all
that
their
ancestors
did
like
children
they
wish
to
act
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
without
any
laborious
preparation
they
would
like
the
progress
of
the
age
to
be
such
as
to
exempt
them
and
their
successors
from
all
fatiguing
study
and
application
in
the
acquirement
of
knowledge
for
instance
a
commercial
friend
of
mine
told
me
the
other
day
that
even
mediocrity
has
become
very
rare
scarcely
any
one
is
fit
to
fulfil
properly
the
duty
which
devolves
upon
him
either
by
necessity
or
choice
this
seems
to
me
to
mark
the
true
distinction
between
this
century
and
the
preceding
ones
at
all
times
greatness
has
been
rare
but
in
former
centuries
mediocrity
prevailed
whereas
in
our
century
nullity
prevails
all
people
wish
to
be
everything
hence
there
is
such
confusion
and
riot
that
no
attention
is
paid
to
the
few
great
men
who
are
still
to
be
found
and
who
are
unable
to
force
a
way
through
the
vast
multitude
of
rivals
thus
whilst
the
lowest
people
believe
themselves
illustrious
obscurity
and
success
in
nothing
is
the
common
fate
both
of
the
highest
and
lowest
but
long
live
statistics
long
live
the
sciences
economical
moral
and
political
the
pocket
encyclopædias
the
manuals
of
everything
and
all
the
other
fine
creations
of
our
age
and
may
the
nineteenth
century
live
for
ever
for
though
poor
in
results
it
is
yet
very
rich
and
great
in
promise
which
is
well
known
to
be
the
best
of
signs
let
us
therefore
console
ourselves
that
for
more
years
this
admirable
century
will
have
the
talking
to
itself
and
will
be
able
to
utter
its
own
opinions
you
speak
it
seems
somewhat
ironically
but
you
ought
at
least
to
remember
that
this
is
a
century
of
transition
what
do
you
infer
from
that
all
centuries
have
been
and
will
be
more
or
less
transitional
because
human
society
is
never
stationary
and
will
never
at
any
time
attain
to
a
fixed
condition
it
follows
therefore
that
this
fine
word
is
either
no
excuse
for
the
nineteenth
century
or
is
one
common
to
all
the
centuries
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
the
transition
now
in
progress
is
from
good
to
better
or
from
bad
to
worse
but
perhaps
you
mean
to
say
that
the
present
age
is
especially
transitional
inasmuch
as
it
is
a
rapid
passage
from
one
state
of
civilisation
to
another
absolutely
different
in
which
case
i
would
ask
your
permission
to
laugh
at
this
rapidity
every
transition
requires
a
certain
amount
of
time
and
when
too
rapidly
accomplished
invariably
relapses
and
the
progress
has
to
recommence
from
the
very
beginning
thus
it
has
always
been
for
nature
does
not
advance
by
leaps
and
when
forced
no
durable
result
is
obtained
in
short
precipitous
transitions
are
only
apparent
transitions
and
do
not
represent
genuine
progress
i
advise
you
not
to
talk
in
this
fashion
with
every
one
because
if
you
do
you
will
gain
many
enemies
what
does
it
matter
henceforth
neither
enemies
nor
friends
can
do
me
much
harm
very
probably
you
will
be
despised
as
one
incapable
of
comprehending
the
spirit
of
modern
philosophy
and
who
cares
little
for
the
progress
of
civilisation
and
the
sciences
i
should
be
very
sorry
for
that
but
what
can
i
do
if
i
am
despised
i
will
endeavour
to
console
myself
but
have
you
or
have
you
not
changed
your
opinions
and
what
is
to
be
done
about
your
book
it
would
be
best
to
burn
it
if
it
be
not
burnt
it
may
be
preserved
as
a
book
full
of
poetic
dreams
inventions
and
melancholy
caprices
or
better
as
an
expression
of
the
unhappiness
of
the
writer
because
i
will
tell
you
in
confidence
my
dear
friend
that
i
believe
you
and
every
one
else
to
be
happy
as
for
myself
however
with
your
permission
and
that
of
the
century
i
am
very
unhappy
and
all
the
journals
of
both
worlds
can
not
persuade
me
to
the
contrary
i
do
not
know
the
cause
of
this
unhappiness
of
which
you
speak
but
a
man
is
the
best
judge
of
his
own
happiness
or
unhappiness
and
his
opinion
can
not
be
wrong
very
true
and
more
i
tell
you
frankly
that
i
do
not
submit
to
my
unhappiness
nor
bow
the
head
and
come
to
terms
with
destiny
like
other
men
i
ardently
wish
for
death
above
everything
with
such
warmth
and
sincerity
as
i
firmly
believe
few
have
desired
it
i
would
not
speak
to
you
thus
if
i
were
not
sure
that
when
the
time
came
i
should
not
belie
my
words
i
may
add
that
although
i
do
not
yet
foresee
the
end
of
my
life
i
have
an
inward
feeling
that
almost
assures
me
the
hour
of
which
i
speak
is
not
far
distant
i
am
more
than
ripe
for
death
and
it
seems
to
me
too
absurd
and
improbable
that
being
dead
spiritually
as
i
am
and
the
tale
of
my
life
being
told
in
every
part
i
should
linger
out
the
forty
or
fifty
years
with
which
nature
threatens
me
i
am
terrified
at
the
mere
thought
of
such
a
thing
but
like
all
evils
that
exceed
the
power
of
imagination
this
seems
to
me
a
dream
and
illusion
devoid
of
truth
so
that
if
any
one
speaks
to
me
about
the
distant
future
as
though
i
were
to
have
a
part
in
it
i
can
not
help
smiling
to
myself
so
sure
am
i
that
i
have
not
long
to
live
this
thought
i
may
say
alone
supports
me
books
and
studies
which
i
often
wonder
i
ever
loved
great
designs
and
hopes
of
glory
and
immortality
are
things
now
undeserving
of
even
a
smile
nor
do
i
now
laugh
at
the
projects
and
hopes
of
this
century
i
cordially
wish
them
every
possible
success
and
i
praise
admire
and
sincerely
honour
their
good
intentions
but
i
do
not
envy
posterity
nor
those
who
have
still
a
long
life
before
them
formerly
i
used
to
envy
fools
imbeciles
and
people
with
a
high
opinion
of
themselves
and
i
would
willingly
have
changed
my
lot
with
any
one
of
them
now
i
envy
neither
fools
nor
the
wise
the
great
the
small
the
weak
the
powerful
i
envy
the
dead
and
with
them
alone
would
i
exchange
my
lot
every
pleasurable
fancy
every
thought
of
the
future
that
comes
to
me
in
my
solitude
and
with
which
i
pass
away
the
time
is
allied
with
the
thought
of
death
from
which
it
is
inseparable
and
in
this
longing
neither
the
remembrance
of
my
childish
dreams
nor
the
thought
of
having
lived
in
vain
disturbs
me
any
more
as
formerly
when
death
comes
to
me
i
shall
die
as
peacefully
and
contentedly
as
if
it
were
the
only
thing
for
which
i
had
ever
wished
in
the
world
this
is
the
sole
prospect
that
reconciles
me
to
destiny
if
on
the
one
hand
i
were
offered
the
fortune
and
fame
of
cæsar
or
alexander
free
from
the
least
stain
and
on
the
other
hand
death
i
should
unhesitatingly
choose
to
die
